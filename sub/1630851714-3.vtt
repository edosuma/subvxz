WEBVTT

00:24.320 --> 00:28.120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:31.680 --> 00:33.640
Good evening and welcome to QI,

00:33.640 --> 00:36.280
where tonight we'll be
pirouetting our parasols

00:36.280 --> 00:41.080
and mixing martinis
in our Shady & Shaky show.

00:41.080 --> 00:44.680
Joining me are a shady lady,
Victoria Coren Mitchell...

00:44.680 --> 00:46.680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:48.640 --> 00:52.360
..the shadow Minister of Mirth,
Eshaan Akbar...

00:52.360 --> 00:56.200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:56.200 --> 00:59.360
..the Sheikh of Shenanigans,
John Barrowman...

00:59.360 --> 01:01.720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:02.760 --> 01:05.520
..and shaking it all about,
it's Alan Davies.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:10.320 --> 01:13.040
Right, let's hear their shady,
shaky signature tunes.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.880
Victoria goes...

01:14.880 --> 01:17.320
# Cos I'm Slim Shady
Yes, I'm the real Shady

01:17.320 --> 01:19.760
# All you other Slim Shadys
are just imitating. #

01:19.760 --> 01:21.400
Eshaan goes...

01:21.400 --> 01:25.520
# The shadow of your smile... #

01:25.520 --> 01:28.400
Nice! Really nice!

01:28.400 --> 01:31.120
Oh, be careful, Eshaan, you'll pull.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.760
John goes...

01:32.760 --> 01:36.160
# I see you, baby
Shakin' that ass

01:36.160 --> 01:38.200
# Shakin' that ass

01:38.200 --> 01:40.520
# Shakin' that ass. #

01:40.520 --> 01:41.840
Perfect.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.880
He comes to life!
Perfect. And Alan goes...

01:44.880 --> 01:48.840
# Put your left arm in
Your left arm out

01:48.840 --> 01:52.640
# In, out, in, out
You shake it all about. #

01:52.640 --> 01:53.680
Right.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.960
Name something that was invented
in either Shaky Town or Shady Town.

01:58.960 --> 02:01.760
I mean, I'm hoping this is
a Shakin' Stevens question.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.480
Oh! Oh.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.280
Because I know a lot about him.
Why? Yeah.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.000
Because I was a big fan of him
as a child,

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
and you know the stuff you learnt -
well, child - as a teenager. Yeah.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.440
It's inexcusable. Yeah.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.480
It's not inexcusable!
Well, he was, let me tell you,

02:15.480 --> 02:18.720
tomorrow is Shakin' Stevens'
73rd birthday.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.760
No!

02:19.760 --> 02:21.600
And I still would. Because...

02:21.600 --> 02:23.040
Yes.

02:24.920 --> 02:29.720
..not only is he gorgeous,
but when you're young,

02:29.720 --> 02:31.160
those kind of things go in.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.160
I know his birthday,
favourite colour, indigo,

02:33.160 --> 02:34.920
real name Michael Barratt.

02:34.920 --> 02:38.760
Stage name, taken from his old
school friend Steven Vanderwalker,

02:38.760 --> 02:40.280
he took the name.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.520
Can I just say,
I've no idea how we got here.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.120
That's what's slightly...
I-I wanted to get

02:45.120 --> 02:46.800
to seismology and geology.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.040
And we...

02:48.040 --> 02:50.040
Is it something to do with,

02:50.040 --> 02:53.200
is Shaky Town something to do
with, like, an earthquake machine?

02:53.200 --> 02:57.000
It's exactly right. So modern
seismology began in Comrie village,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
so it's in Perthshire. It's your
part of the world, is it not?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.200
Up in Scotland.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.560
Yeah.
An earthquake machine in Scotland?

03:03.560 --> 03:05.040
Yes. It's known as...

03:05.040 --> 03:07.640
IN SCOTTISH ACCENT: "Shaky Toon."
How was that?

03:07.640 --> 03:09.880
Very good. That was good.
That was brilliant!

03:09.880 --> 03:12.400
"Shaky Toon." So an incredible
number of earthquakes,

03:12.400 --> 03:14.560
which you maybe wouldn't even
think of in Scotland.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.400
The late-18th to the mid-19th
century, thousands of earthquakes.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.680
There is a thing called
the Highland Boundary Fault,

03:20.680 --> 03:23.720
and the position of this town
is astride the fault.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.240
And it still records more

03:25.240 --> 03:27.800
and stronger tremors
than anywhere else in Britain.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.920
It is officially
Britain's shakiest town.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.720
And so they wanted to measure it and
it's the very first purpose-built

03:34.720 --> 03:38.240
seismology station in the world,
known as Earthquake House.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.200
It's basically a hut in a field,
if I'm honest with you.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.240
It looks like a public toilet!
I know.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.320
It does! It's so British -
"Look what we've made!"

03:46.320 --> 03:50.520
I bet you open the door and you can
see to the core of the Earth.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.000
It was instigated by
the Comrie Pioneers,

03:57.000 --> 03:58.560
basically the local postmaster.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.320
He devised one of the earliest
measures for earthquakes.

04:01.320 --> 04:05.560
So a ten was a quake that they had
in October of 1839,

04:05.560 --> 04:07.760
which was felt over
most of Scotland.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.960
IN SCOTTISH ACCENT: That's when
the teapot rattles!

04:09.960 --> 04:12.480
Yeah. So the Comrie Scale
is different scales of quake.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.400
So number ten,
massive quake in 1839.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.000
And then number one, I like,
is called Just Sensible.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.880
What? What? Yeah.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.560
Just capable of being sensed.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.200
It's a quiver. Oh.
It's more of a...

04:23.200 --> 04:24.600
Oh. We've all had those.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.400
That's a different kind of
earthquake! That is, yeah.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.200
So incredibly simple mechanism -
you get two wooden beams,

04:31.200 --> 04:33.720
you get one going north and south
and one going east and west,

04:33.720 --> 04:36.200
like that, with wooden cylinders
of various sizes on top.

04:36.200 --> 04:40.240
And it took various sizes of quake
to get the cylinders to fall off.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.080
It's not very complicated.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.840
And then sod's law stepped in,
they built the Earthquake House

04:45.840 --> 04:47.720
and that coincided pretty much

04:47.720 --> 04:51.000
with the end of the great era
of earthquakes in Comrie.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.480
It's as if the earthquake
had just moved on.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.800
Yeah. "Oh, they've built something,
let's go." Yeah.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.760
What happened to the postman? Uh...

04:57.760 --> 04:59.680
Well, he is remembered for having
done this,

04:59.680 --> 05:01.920
not so remembered that I
can tell you what his name is.

05:01.920 --> 05:06.240
I reckon he invented it to explain
why whenever he delivered things, it
was always broken in the box. Yes.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.120
But, we now realise that this hut is
of historic significance, and they

05:10.120 --> 05:13.360
have in fact updated it with modern
equipment so sensitive, it picked up

05:13.360 --> 05:17.400
the tsunami on Boxing Day 2004 in
Indonesia, so that is extraordinary.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.000
Wow. Wow. No way.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.920
So it wasn't related to the Richter
scale? Yeah, is not different?

05:21.920 --> 05:23.040
No.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.080
Yes, the Richter scale is entirely
different, yeah.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.600
So this was the
first measure that we had.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.040
Right, so we've Shaky Toon,
let's go to Shady Town.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.200
It is, I can tell you,
also in Scotland. Any thoughts?

05:34.200 --> 05:36.320
A place where the sun never shines?

05:36.320 --> 05:38.840
Yes, darling, it is.
Lochranza on Arran.

05:38.840 --> 05:43.040
It is the UK's,
possibly the world's, shadiest town.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.280
It gets fewer annual hours
of sunshine than anywhere else,

05:46.280 --> 05:49.240
because it sits on a sort of
north-facing glen on a rainy island.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.600
It has no street lights.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.280
I have to say, I've been there,
and it is extremely beautiful.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.080
But it is also the birthplace
of modern geology.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.560
So we've got two places
in Scotland that have done

05:59.560 --> 06:01.040
wonders for the study of the planet,

06:01.040 --> 06:03.920
and the man known as
the father of modern geology,

06:03.920 --> 06:05.920
James Hutton, he visited in 1787,

06:05.920 --> 06:08.520
and he discovered,
it was the very first example

06:08.520 --> 06:11.160
of what's called
Hutton's Unconformity.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.440
And I love this, because I notice it
and don't know what it is,

06:14.440 --> 06:18.440
but it's a junction between
different types of rock formation.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.960
And he developed the idea that
such formations could only have

06:21.960 --> 06:24.160
resulted over unimaginable time,

06:24.160 --> 06:27.320
so the Earth could not be young,
as the Bible claimed.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.160
So I think we can just show you,
with some writing on the top.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.000
Can you see how you've got
the ones that are the structures

06:33.000 --> 06:36.160
that are going up, like that?
Yeah. And isn't it incredible?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.880
So, he has supported what was called
Plutonism,

06:38.880 --> 06:41.040
which is that rocks are
formed by volcanic action

06:41.040 --> 06:44.440
against Neptunism that rocks were
formed by the biblical flood.

06:44.440 --> 06:49.920
It's stunningly beautiful, I think,
the way the Earth has shifted and
moved like that. It's wonderful.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.680
Anyway, he wrote a line
in a 1788 paper which has,

06:53.680 --> 06:56.320
well, it's echoed through
geological science ever since.

06:56.320 --> 07:00.080
"The result therefore of
our present enquiry is that

07:00.080 --> 07:04.240
"we find no vestige of a beginning -
no prospect of an end."

07:04.240 --> 07:07.120
It's really lovely.
Modern seismology and geology

07:07.120 --> 07:10.080
were invented 60 miles
from each other, in Scotland.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.560
Describe the dark side
of puppeteering.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.640
Well, surely
it's everything that goes on...

07:17.640 --> 07:20.080
Yeah. Underneath.
..below the desk!

07:21.720 --> 07:23.840
"That's the way to do it!"
I dread to think.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.520
Alan, stop playing with your puppet
under the table.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.480
Yeah. What do all the other puppets
do when you put them down?

07:30.480 --> 07:31.920
Yes, keep the hands up here!

07:31.920 --> 07:35.160
It's a specific kind of puppetry
that we're thinking of.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.000
The dark side of puppetry.
Any thoughts?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.360
Shadows? Shadows.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.240
What about Hank Marvin?
Would you or wouldn't you?

07:42.240 --> 07:45.480
I tell you what,
Cliff Richard I definitely would.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.280
Don't say anything - I would.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.800
We're talking about
a specific type of shadow puppetry.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.320
I've got some examples here.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.000
So it's Java, Indonesia,
Southeast Asia.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.480
Oh, wow. Oh, right.

07:57.480 --> 08:00.840
It's a 1,000-year-old form
of shadow puppet theatre called

08:00.840 --> 08:04.240
wayang.
So they often tell Hindu epics.

08:04.240 --> 08:08.200
The only thing is, the shows can
last eight or more hours, right.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.240
Of course they can.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.640
I mean, have you seen a Bollywood
film? They last 16 days.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.760
Yes, exactly that. I mean,

08:12.760 --> 08:15.400
all puppet shows FEEL like
they've lasted eight or nine hours.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.680
Yes, that's true. The ninth hour
of the Punch & Judy epic.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.800
Unfortunately, it is a skill
which is very slightly dying out,

08:21.800 --> 08:24.400
so some of the puppeteers
have taken to performing

08:24.400 --> 08:27.560
Star Wars-themed shows, for
example, to younger audiences.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.280
And they take some liberties.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.560
So there we've got Chewbacca
and Han Solo.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.000
I am all for that.
You think that's OK?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.480
Love it, still have my original
Star Wars toys.

08:36.480 --> 08:41.240
I have a whole section of the garage
devoted to Star Wars memorabilia.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.840
I even have my Star Wars

08:42.840 --> 08:45.480
pyjama, you know, pants.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.480
CHUCKLING

08:45.480 --> 08:49.880
And I go to... Don't laugh at me!
I go to bed dressed in Star Wars.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.120
Where else is he going to keep
his lightsaber at night?!

08:53.120 --> 08:56.160
You see?
I mean, I've got nothing.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.400
But, yeah, massive Star Wars fan.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.560
I think that's a great idea.
Do you only have the trousers?

09:01.560 --> 09:04.480
No, I have the top too,
but it's, like, I have one that's

09:04.480 --> 09:07.160
Darth Vader pants
and then on the top it says,

09:07.160 --> 09:08.600
"I'm your daddy."

09:08.600 --> 09:10.840
LAUGHTER

09:16.680 --> 09:19.440
That is just so wrong. I've never
watched Star Wars. Did you want

09:19.440 --> 09:24.000
to confess anything? I'm turning
it into therapy. Well, yeah, maybe.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.720
I don't know. I think not seeing
Star Wars is a confession in itself.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.880
That's a big confession,
isn't it? That is quite big.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.600
Alan, anything you want to reveal
to the rest of the world? Oh, many.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.480
Actually, I asked you this once
and you told me

09:33.480 --> 09:35.760
you'd pooed on Hampstead Heath
or something. Oh, yes.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.880
That's right. And I'm not
falling into this trap again.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.760
Lovely.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.000
Anyway, they are now using
wayang shows, which is

09:47.000 --> 09:49.480
what this puppetry is,
to explain all sorts of things.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.760
They've used it for Covid-19,

09:50.760 --> 09:52.840
they use it for
the destruction of coral reefs.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.960
I mean, all sorts of
kind of educational stuff.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.640
It's quite complex and traditionally
there's just one puppet master,

09:58.640 --> 09:59.960
who's called a dalang,

09:59.960 --> 10:02.000
and they are highly respected,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
and it used to be that Indonesian
children wanted to grow up

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
and be a dalang. Ah.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.760
Usually boys would work the puppets
and girls play the "gender",

10:10.760 --> 10:12.320
which a bit like a glockenspiel.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.000
And the puppets, as you can see,
are really intricate.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.840
And, perversely, considering
they're there to create shadows,

10:17.840 --> 10:20.520
they're very brightly painted.
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?

10:20.520 --> 10:21.960
Yes. It's just a curiosity.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.400
I've got a very, this is a move.
"Yas queen!

10:25.400 --> 10:28.160
"Yas queen, yas!

10:28.160 --> 10:32.160
"Yas queen, yas, yas, yas!
Yas queen!"

10:33.280 --> 10:36.680
What's that thing called, darling?
Is it called a GIF or whatever it is
where a TikTok thing?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.520
Cluck? Yeah, could I say something

10:38.520 --> 10:41.120
and you just stand behind me going,
"Yas queen!"?

10:41.120 --> 10:42.960
Yas queen! I love that!

10:42.960 --> 10:45.920
I'll do a soundbite for you, you
can use it. Yes, please. I'd like
that very much.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.480
I really enjoyed the talk
about social media. That was cute.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.240
LAUGHTER

10:51.240 --> 10:54.400
I definitely have no idea what I
just said.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.360
"Could I do a GIF on TikTok?"
"No, you can't."

10:57.360 --> 10:59.840
LAUGHTER

10:59.840 --> 11:01.920
I don't do any of it.
You do it, don't you, darling?

11:01.920 --> 11:03.400
You do all that social media.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.960
No. No. I... No. No.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.880
TikTok is it... It is a dancing
thing. I think you would be great at
it.

11:09.880 --> 11:14.400
You could do a musical thing which
is like...would, wouldn't, would,
would, wouldn't.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.840
It would be...

11:14.400 --> 11:16.840
LAUGHTER

11:16.840 --> 11:19.520
"Tell me you want to sleep with
Shakin' Stevens

11:19.520 --> 11:23.320
"without telling me you want
to sleep with Shakin' Stevens."

11:23.320 --> 11:26.200
LAUGHTER

11:26.200 --> 11:29.760
And the puppeteer, it's improv.
They improvise most of the play.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.520
Do they come out and say,
"So can someone give me an object?

11:32.520 --> 11:35.920
Yes. "An object, situation,
then let's have a feeling,

11:35.920 --> 11:37.200
"let's have an emotion."

11:37.200 --> 11:39.360
Unusual occupation. Yeah.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.560
Let's go for that. "Gynaecologist!"

11:41.560 --> 11:42.880
Yeah.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.440
Can I tell you this,
about when I first took my daughter

11:46.440 --> 11:48.680
to a puppet show? I found this
very, very annoying.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.640
The puppeteer came out
and, you know, had the puppets

11:51.640 --> 11:54.920
and spoke to the audience,
and I wanted to say, "Look, fine.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.120
"After the age of about 30,
magnificent,

11:57.120 --> 11:58.960
"break it down, deconstruct it."

11:58.960 --> 12:01.560
She, my child is three,
she thinks it's real.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.560
Just bring it up behind a hay bale.

12:03.560 --> 12:07.320
It's fine.
Let it be a talking creature.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.160
I used to watch Rainbow.

12:10.160 --> 12:14.720
I was 15 before I wonder why
Zippy was always behind something.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.720
LAUGHTER

12:16.720 --> 12:19.600
They're having a picnic.
He's behind a bush.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.920
Oh, they are in the kitchen,
he is behind the washing machine.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.240
Never asked the question.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.880
Have you ever worked with
the Muppets? I have.

12:25.880 --> 12:30.320
Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing to be like
with Kermit or Miss Piggy or anyone.

12:30.320 --> 12:33.320
It's very difficult
not to reference them if you don't.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.880
But Kermit's the weirdest one,
cos it's, like, on his head.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.320
It's on his head. Yeah. And
he's working the hands like that.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.320
I still would. Of course.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.120
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

12:42.120 --> 12:43.600
Come on!

12:49.680 --> 12:52.600
Shall we see if we can revive
a traditional shadow puppet

12:52.600 --> 12:54.080
artform ourselves?

12:54.080 --> 12:59.960
Shadowgraphy is the art of making
shadow shapes with your hands.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.200
I'll just show you the sort of
shapes that we are looking for, OK?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.920
So there is a wolf, and there's
a goat and there's a swan

13:05.920 --> 13:07.800
and a rabbit, OK?

13:07.800 --> 13:10.080
And I want you to see
if you can recreate those.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.760
So, you two, go behind the screen
and you two try

13:12.760 --> 13:16.200
and guess which ones that they are
doing.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.360
Oh, don't go behind a screen
and then... What's going to happen?

13:19.360 --> 13:21.800
I know, you never know. Right. OK.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.160
Eshaan, you've got such tiny hands.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.400
Oh, look! I beg your pardon!

13:26.400 --> 13:29.640
Right, let's... I don't know...
What do you think Eshaan is doing?

13:29.640 --> 13:31.360
Is it a jellyfish?

13:31.360 --> 13:33.520
I don't know. Eshaan is telling us
where to go, I think.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.640
I think it's something...

13:34.640 --> 13:36.520
ROARING

13:36.520 --> 13:39.120
It's a frog with an enormous vulva.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.160
That's a rabbit. Or a squirrel.
Squirrel? Squirrel?

13:45.160 --> 13:49.840
Is it a rabbit? Rabbit.
Is it a rabbit? It's being attacked!

13:49.840 --> 13:51.200
It's Rod Hull and Emu.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.600
A swan with a hand coming
out of its arse. What is this?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.960
The thumb is not working for me.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.040
What do you mean the swan is not
working for you?!

13:59.040 --> 14:02.600
Well, make it speak or eat or
something. There we go. Well done!

14:02.600 --> 14:04.760
Let's have a go with you
two having a go.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.320
Off you go, round the screen.

14:06.320 --> 14:10.240
Luckily, I'm known
for my knock-about, physical comedy.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.480
I can't wait to see this.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.080
I can't believe Alan said I've
got small hands.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.880
Darling, it's perspective.
It's not the size.
Yes, exactly. Thank you!

14:18.880 --> 14:22.520
OK, here we go.
Alan is doing a spider.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.680
It looks like a...duck.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.960
Oh, a fox. Oh, Victoria's very good.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.280
That is very good. Yeah.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.280
APPLAUSE

14:32.280 --> 14:33.840
Yeah! I literally don't know...

14:33.840 --> 14:35.680
ALAN: I don't know what mine is
either.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.800
Oh, hang on a minute, it is
a bit more bent.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.280
And as for the fingers...

14:39.280 --> 14:43.560
LAUGHTER

14:43.560 --> 14:45.360
Alan's looks like a tapeworm.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.360
Yeah. What is that?

14:48.360 --> 14:51.320
It's exploding out of John Hurt's...

14:51.320 --> 14:53.040
It's a goat. It's a goat?

14:53.040 --> 14:55.360
It's a goat? Very well done.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.000
Yeah! It's a goat.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.520
Who knew that you had wolf in you?

15:03.520 --> 15:07.000
I think I have made that
perfectly clear.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.840
Now, what's shady
and two dimensional about this guy?

15:10.840 --> 15:12.960
So, if I give you his name
it may help.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.880
He was the French Minister of
Finance for just eight months

15:16.880 --> 15:19.920
under Louis XIV and he was
called Etienne de Silhouette.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.560
Is that why...silhouette, because
he's thought of as a shadowy figure?

15:23.560 --> 15:26.760
It's why shadow portraits, you know
the portraits where you just get....

15:26.760 --> 15:29.080
Yes. ..the sort of outline of
a person done in black? Yes. Yeah.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.080
They're known as silhouettes and
it is because his, well, the normal

15:32.080 --> 15:35.240
explanation, his austerity policies,
which eventually got him fired,

15:35.240 --> 15:38.040
caused his name to be associated
with sort of general thriftiness.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.560
And these were cheaper portraits

15:39.560 --> 15:42.240
for people who couldn't afford
to have oil portraits. Oh.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.600
I think they're very beautiful,
but it's not for me to say.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.080
We have an expert with us.

15:46.080 --> 15:49.360
Please welcome master silhouettist
Charles Burns. There he is.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.080
APPLAUSE

15:51.080 --> 15:54.600
Charles, tell me, how did you learn
to be a silhouettist?

15:54.600 --> 15:55.760
How did that happen?

15:55.760 --> 15:58.440
When I left art college,
I worked for a number of years

15:58.440 --> 16:00.760
as a street portrait artist
in Covent Garden,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.640
and drawing portraits originally.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.280
And then I started
cutting silhouettes more or less

16:05.280 --> 16:08.000
as a sideline, but they completely
took over my life.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.560
They became very popular in Europe,

16:09.560 --> 16:11.480
and they came over,
didn't they, from France?

16:11.480 --> 16:13.000
They did, they became very popular

16:13.000 --> 16:15.360
throughout the 18th
and early 19th centuries.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.080
But they died out, really,
when photography was invented

16:18.080 --> 16:20.480
and all the silhouette artists
went out of business.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.800
Which I think is a great shame.
In fact, studios used to be

16:22.800 --> 16:24.920
equipped sometimes with
a physio...physionog...

16:24.920 --> 16:27.960
A physiognotrace... Physiognotrace.
..is the word you're looking for.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.960
The physiognotrace was like an arm,

16:29.960 --> 16:34.360
like a metal bar, which used to be
passed around someone's profile,

16:34.360 --> 16:38.600
and at the other end of the bar was
a little pencil which, on a small

16:38.600 --> 16:42.040
piece of paper, would draw upside
down and in reverse, their profile.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.720
But you don't do anything as a...?

16:43.720 --> 16:46.360
No, I rely entirely
on a pair of scissors.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.560
A pair of scissors. And a technique
I call "cut and hope".

16:49.560 --> 16:51.400
OK. I like that!

16:51.400 --> 16:54.320
So, so you're going to do
our silhouettes,

16:54.320 --> 16:55.760
while we're carrying on chatting.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.280
Yes. So can I get you to sit
and carry on with your...

16:58.280 --> 17:00.760
I shall go and explore your profile.
..cutting away. Oh, OK!

17:02.400 --> 17:04.200
Imagine you're on a coin.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.840
While he's cutting away,

17:05.840 --> 17:08.920
I can tell you there was even
an automaton called Prosopographus.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.160
So prosopon is Greek for face,

17:11.160 --> 17:14.600
and it was set up in the 1820s
on the Strand in London

17:14.600 --> 17:17.520
by a silhouette artist
called Charles Herve.

17:17.520 --> 17:21.040
And it was a sort of small robotic
figure sitting on a box

17:21.040 --> 17:24.240
with a tablet in one hand
and a stylus on the other.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.920
And it drew an outline of your face

17:25.920 --> 17:28.040
which could then be
cut into a silhouette.

17:28.040 --> 17:31.560
We have no idea how this,
the automaton worked, although

17:31.560 --> 17:35.640
some visitors reported seeing
"human eyes behind the curtain".

17:35.640 --> 17:39.080
So... We are assuming
there was a human inside.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.480
Have a quick look at this
and tell me what you see here.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.680
Two faces looking at each other.
Two faces looking at each other.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.120
I can see both. All right!
I see two faces or a vase.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.600
Or a vase.
What do you see, Victoria? Um...

17:51.600 --> 17:53.400
Shakin' Stevens...

17:58.560 --> 18:01.560
A sort of goblet or two people.
Yeah. Yeah.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.840
It is in fact known as Rubin's Vase.

18:03.840 --> 18:07.320
So, Danish psychologist
Edgar Rubin, 1915.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.760
And it's very interesting how
the brain decides what is an object

18:11.760 --> 18:13.480
and what is the background.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.520
So, an object
sometimes has a sharper colour,

18:16.520 --> 18:18.360
there are visual clues.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.240
Maybe it's closer, or it gives you
an emotional response.

18:21.240 --> 18:25.280
If you remove all of those things,
the brain cannot consistently

18:25.280 --> 18:28.200
distinguish the object
from the background. Right.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.320
So, depending on how we look at it,
might think it's a face immediately,

18:31.320 --> 18:33.400
might think it's a vase immediately.
Really?

18:33.400 --> 18:37.080
Yeah. There are two British artists,
Tim Noble and Sue Webster,

18:37.080 --> 18:38.360
they developed a technique,

18:38.360 --> 18:40.520
and they create silhouettes from
heaps of junk.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.400
They started their work in 1997.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.200
This is one of their pieces that
was at the Royal Academy.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.680
So that's just junk. Shut up!

18:46.680 --> 18:49.640
It's old wood and rusty tools and
toilet roll and all sorts of things.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.520
And that's them in silhouette.
That is great. That's amazing.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.960
I think it's one of the best things
I have ever seen.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.240
People are so creative. I mean,
as an Asian kid growing up,

18:58.240 --> 18:59.680
imagine if I told my dad,

18:59.680 --> 19:02.120
"Dad, I want to do stuff with
rubbish and make silhouettes."

19:02.120 --> 19:04.880
Yeah. He'd be like, "What are you
talking about? Just go on QI."

19:04.880 --> 19:06.200
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.160
Don't even need to make silhouettes.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.440
Although tonight we can make rubbish
and silhouettes,

19:10.440 --> 19:12.440
because I think Charles has
finished. Darling,

19:12.440 --> 19:14.720
are you going to reveal for us?
I can reveal for you, yes.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.160
Oh, right. So we'll have Victoria
first. OK.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.400
There she is.
There we are, there you are.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.560
Oh! Wow!

19:20.560 --> 19:22.640
Cute. Ah, clever. Yeah, amazing.
APPLAUSE

19:24.040 --> 19:27.600
Could you just, just take
a couple of inches off the nose?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.960
Just bring...

19:28.960 --> 19:30.680
LAUGHTER

19:30.680 --> 19:32.320
Right, shall we do Alan?

19:33.320 --> 19:35.520
Oh! Oh, wow! Yes. That's great!

19:35.520 --> 19:38.440
Oh, that's very good. Wow, you look
at the little hair detail

19:38.440 --> 19:40.520
at the top, even. That's amazing.
APPLAUSE

19:40.520 --> 19:43.320
That's very clever. Uh, Eshaan.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.880
As long as I don't look like Romesh
in this one. Right.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.080
LAUGHTER

19:50.200 --> 19:52.880
Pff!

19:50.200 --> 19:52.880
LAUGHTER

19:54.920 --> 19:56.680
I-I look so much older.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.680
But the glasses are so brilliant.
Yeah. Yeah, the glasses are great.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.360
That's so clever. Right, Johnny,
let's try you, darling.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.120
Oh! Oh, look at that.
You handsome devil.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.440
So handsome. Yeah, amazing.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.640
That's brilliant.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.120
You're so handsome,
even as a cut-out. Lovely. Wow!

20:14.120 --> 20:16.680
I think those are brilliant.
That's so clever.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.200
You were literally just doing that
with a pair of scissors?

20:19.200 --> 20:21.800
Yes, I have, yes. It's amazing.
A freehand cut with scissors.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.320
Because I can't even cut
a straight line on wrapping paper.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.680
Straight lines are much harder.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.200
I think you're a secret Doctor Who.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.040
You've got the coat, you've got
the look. You're a secret Doctor.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.040
Yeah. Now, this contains
everything I need. See?!

20:33.040 --> 20:35.800
Charles, it's been such a pleasure.
Thank you for coming in.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

20:35.800 --> 20:38.320
Thank you. Thanks awfully.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.280
Right. What's a McKinley grip?

20:45.280 --> 20:46.880
Ooh. Oh...

20:46.880 --> 20:50.440
So, the whole show is
shade and shake.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.120
A shaky grip? A shaky grip...

20:52.120 --> 20:54.400
Is it? A shaky grip, yeah.
So what do we do?

20:54.400 --> 20:56.360
We shake parts of our body,
we shake...?

20:56.360 --> 21:00.800
The only McKinley that I know
is William McKinley,

21:00.800 --> 21:02.440
the President of the United States?

21:02.440 --> 21:05.240
Absolutely right, is the McKinley
grip, yeah. He was assassinated.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.640
Yes, he was, yeah. I don't know
if he was a Mason or whatever,

21:07.640 --> 21:09.160
but I know he's a Republican.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.120
So there might have been
a secret handshake?

21:11.120 --> 21:12.200
It wasn't a secret,

21:12.200 --> 21:14.640
it was that he was
fantastically good at shaking hands.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.120
There was a tradition
throughout the 19th century

21:17.120 --> 21:19.800
in the United States that if anybody
wanted to, they could turn up

21:19.800 --> 21:22.640
at the White House on New Year's Day
and shake the President's hand.

21:22.640 --> 21:26.760
And President McKinley was,
he was in office 1897 to 1901,

21:26.760 --> 21:30.000
he was an enthusiastic hand-shaker,
said to have once shaken

21:30.000 --> 21:34.080
5,000 hands in a single session,
but it had to be quick.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.440
So he developed something called
the McKinley grip.

21:36.440 --> 21:39.720
What you do is, you give a beaming
smile, you grab somebody's hand

21:39.720 --> 21:42.720
before they have a chance to take
yours, you give it a swift squeeze.

21:42.720 --> 21:46.080
In your other hand you take hold
of the elbow and push them away.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.400
Ah. Oh, yeah. OK.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.080
This was the McKinley grip,
just get rid of them, like that.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.640
What a metaphor for
all social interaction! I know.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.000
How hysterical.
"Come here, go away."

21:57.000 --> 21:59.760
But you're quite right,
he was engaged in just such a thing

21:59.760 --> 22:02.320
when he was murdered.
September 6th, 1901,

22:02.320 --> 22:03.560
he was in Buffalo, New York,

22:03.560 --> 22:07.720
at the Pan-American Exposition, when
an anarchist called Leon Czolgosz

22:07.720 --> 22:10.960
turned up and he had his right hand
covered with a handkerchief.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.480
And the President thought
he had some injury or other,

22:13.480 --> 22:15.000
but in fact he shot him point blank.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.040
He died of infection
about eight days later.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.200
Now, here's the thing,
we shake hands, we also shake heads.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.800
I think we've said this before
on this show, Alan.

22:22.800 --> 22:27.040
Some countries, like Bulgaria,
they shake for yes and nod for no.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.080
So we're going to try
a little experiment.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.440
I'm going to ask you
a series of quickfire questions

22:31.440 --> 22:32.680
with yes or no answers, right?

22:32.680 --> 22:35.200
You have to answer immediately,
but whatever answer you give

22:35.200 --> 22:37.720
with your voice, you have to give
the opposite with your head.

22:37.720 --> 22:41.080
Ah... OK. And I'll ping my pinger
if you get it wrong.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.840
Does everybody understand?
You pinging your pinger?

22:43.840 --> 22:46.080
No, I'm just asking.
Yes, I do understand. Yes.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.680
Yes. Just I'm trying to catch you
out, that's all. Yes, damn it.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.760
OK, all right, ready. John,
was the first James Bond film

22:51.760 --> 22:53.200
the one about the Doctor?

22:55.800 --> 22:57.560
Yes.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.360
I don't know. That's right.

23:01.360 --> 23:04.680
Is it right? Yes. What was the name
of the Doctor? Yes, Doctor No.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.160
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

23:10.520 --> 23:12.960
Eshaan, do you know
what band featured

23:12.960 --> 23:15.200
the keyboard player Rick Wakeman?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.440
LAUGHTER

23:16.440 --> 23:18.680
No. You don't know?

23:18.680 --> 23:20.360
No. OK.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.680
But it's... It's... It's... It's...?
It's...

23:22.680 --> 23:24.160
Yes.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.160
The band is called Yes.

23:26.160 --> 23:29.600
Yes is the band.
But you didn't know. I... No.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.400
This would be a great drinking game!
It is.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.400
Yeah, very weird. Victoria, do you
know what it means when you nod?

23:40.560 --> 23:42.760
Do I know what it means
when you nod?

23:42.760 --> 23:45.760
Yes, I know what it means.

23:45.760 --> 23:49.160
Or, yes, I KNOW what it means.
KNOW what it means.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.160
Alan,
have you stopped kicking the dog?

23:52.680 --> 23:55.280
Yes. I never kick the dog! Yeah.

23:55.280 --> 23:58.520
It's quite complicated, isn't it?
It's quite, it's quite weird.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.320
Yes. Nobody knows why the Bulgarians
do it the other way round.

24:01.320 --> 24:04.040
So, there's a folk tale
that they were forced to

24:04.040 --> 24:06.680
change their religion by invaders,
and so they pretended

24:06.680 --> 24:09.440
no meant yes when they were
interrogated about their faith.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.880
It's a bit like crossing
your fingers when you tell a lie.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.640
That's great.
I did a movie in Bulgaria,

24:13.640 --> 24:14.920
and I was diving in the movie,

24:14.920 --> 24:17.160
and that was part of the reason
I also got the movie,

24:17.160 --> 24:19.760
because I was,
I'm a registered diver.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.640
They said I had to go
in this big tank.

24:21.640 --> 24:26.120
And I was given a small canister
with oxygen in it.

24:26.120 --> 24:30.080
I would breathe, put the oxygen
away, then escape from the tank.

24:30.080 --> 24:33.680
But I went down and I said
to the guy, "Is it unlocked?"

24:33.680 --> 24:35.760
And he went, "Yes."

24:36.920 --> 24:39.000
Like I'm not going down.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.480
And he's like...I'm, "Is it locked?"
"Yes, it is."

24:42.480 --> 24:45.160
What was the film, darling?
Oh, you don't want to know.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.000
No, I really want to see it.
Yeah, we do.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.680
It's called
Shark Attack 3: Megalodon.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.080
LAUGHTER

24:52.080 --> 24:53.720
Oh, my.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.880
All I'll say is that
it bought me my first place.

24:56.880 --> 25:00.320
There's an even more, apparently
ambiguous, is the head bobble.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.480
So this is a form of
nonverbal communication.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.920
It's commonly found in India,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.240
So, according to...

25:06.240 --> 25:07.880
Hi, guys!

25:09.120 --> 25:10.960
I'm looking at John.

25:10.960 --> 25:14.840
According to a behaviourist from
Tamil Nadu, Pradeep Chakravarthy,

25:14.840 --> 25:17.760
it may have evolved to give
a deliberately ambiguous signal.

25:17.760 --> 25:20.560
So it's sort of you can disagree
with somebody while not saying

25:20.560 --> 25:23.520
anything. Yes, that's the head
bobble. It means, yes, no, maybe.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.320
It means everything, really. OK.
They do it in Bangladesh as well.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.480
Right. But you're
being noncommittal, is that it?

25:28.480 --> 25:30.720
Yeah, and... Just do it
and I'll give you the verbal.

25:30.720 --> 25:34.040
The movement is more from the chin,
actually. Right. So it's just a...

25:34.040 --> 25:35.360
Yas queen.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.880
Cos my parents would use it with me
as well. Every time when I was like,

25:37.880 --> 25:39.400
"Oh, Mum, can I go out with my
friends?"

25:39.400 --> 25:42.440
She'd be like, "Yeah. No. Maybe."

25:42.440 --> 25:45.760
I went to India one time and lots
of people did that and it is...

25:45.760 --> 25:49.560
It is something that is really
non-confrontational is what I...

25:49.560 --> 25:51.560
Yeah. Sort of diffusing things.
I quite like it.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.160
I mean, the last time I was on,
I talked about Bollywood dancing
and I'm doing it again.

25:55.160 --> 25:59.440
But, this neck move is very clearly
kind of like a no, isn't it?

25:59.440 --> 26:01.000
You know it's a no. Hm.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.640
Well, I would,
in the gay world we'd disagree.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.080
That's like, "Get over here!"

26:06.080 --> 26:07.640
That's pretty good!

26:07.640 --> 26:10.360
That is great. Yas queen.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.160
Yes. No.

26:12.160 --> 26:15.800
Is there any gesture
that ISN'T that?!

26:15.800 --> 26:18.080
I'll do gay Bollywood.
You do gay Bollywood.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.520
So the head bobble. Yeah, the head
bobble is from the chin, I think.

26:23.520 --> 26:27.520
From the chin. It's really hard.
That's pretty good actually, Alan.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.400
That's a good one.
It's a very relaxed thing.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.360
No. I mean, I look like I'm trying

26:32.360 --> 26:34.280
to decide which kind of herring

26:34.280 --> 26:37.320
to have for dinner.
That's really, that's...

26:37.320 --> 26:40.240
Right, here's a pretty shady way
to carry on.

26:40.240 --> 26:44.120
What's the best way
to sabotage a sewage system?

26:44.120 --> 26:46.280
# Shadow... #

26:46.280 --> 26:49.760
# Of your smile. #
It begins with S, I'm going to say.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.280
S? Yes. Shit.
Oh, I was going to say blocking.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.240
LAUGHTER

26:52.280 --> 26:55.240
Shit! I was not going to say that,

26:52.280 --> 26:55.240
but there you go.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.800
Oh, you're not going to flash "shit"
at me, are you?!

26:59.160 --> 27:00.560
What were you going to say?

27:00.560 --> 27:03.040
It was similar to that,
let me have a drunken kebab.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.000
Right, and that would be
the way forward? Yeah.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.720
Have you ever been sabotaged? No.
Anything ever happened to you?

27:07.720 --> 27:09.320
I've... Speaking of shit.

27:09.320 --> 27:12.000
And you've pooped
in Hampstead Heath.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.080
It is well-known.
How is this still coming up?!

27:18.320 --> 27:20.680
That was a number of years ago now!

27:20.680 --> 27:22.600
Oh, it is still there!

27:22.600 --> 27:26.560
Since lockdown, most of Hempstead
has gone at least once on the Heath.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.040
Yeah, that's true.
Since they shut all the toilets.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.400
You know it is now called
wild toileting? Is it? Yeah.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.640
I was doing a show
in Nashville, Tennessee where

27:34.640 --> 27:36.680
I was dressed in white polyester.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.720
It was the '80s. And...

27:38.720 --> 27:41.760
To qualify. To qualify.

27:41.760 --> 27:46.280
And I was doing a number called
I Got Rhythm.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.000
And I felt like a little
rumble in my tummy

27:49.000 --> 27:50.680
and I thought,
I'm just going to fart.

27:50.680 --> 27:52.800
And I just felt heat. No!

27:52.800 --> 27:55.000
Heat in my polyester white pants.
Oh!

27:55.000 --> 27:58.760
I kept kicking and I was trying to
get offstage, still kicking,

27:58.760 --> 28:01.200
still the professional,
still singing and kicking.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.440
I was spraying the audience... Oh!

28:06.320 --> 28:07.640
Brilliant!

28:07.640 --> 28:11.720
I literally got off stage and my
understudy was laughing backstage.

28:11.720 --> 28:17.120
He'd put Ex-Lax... No! Yes! Which is
a laxative in my drinking water.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.840
And I literally...

28:18.840 --> 28:24.600
My bowels emptied on stage in my
pants, in my white polyester...

28:24.600 --> 28:26.720
In the front row. And I still felt
fabulous.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.320
And the front row knew about it.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.920
That was really a shitty
performance!

28:32.920 --> 28:36.200
LAUGHTER

28:36.200 --> 28:38.440
Can we get a silhouette of that?

28:39.760 --> 28:43.120
I think that might be the worst
thing I've ever heard.

28:43.120 --> 28:47.280
Anyway... None of that has anything
to do with the answer.

28:48.640 --> 28:53.360
In 1944, the US Office
of Strategic Services, that's

28:53.360 --> 28:57.040
the sort of predecessor organisation
to the CIA, produced this.

28:57.040 --> 29:00.240
And it's a
Simple Sabotage Field Manual.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.640
Oh. And it's a guide to
a range of different ways where

29:02.640 --> 29:05.600
you can undermine the enemy's...
their economy, their morale,

29:05.600 --> 29:07.480
their military offensiveness,
and so on.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.880
And it's fantastic in the scope
of stuff in this rather narrow book.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.440
Demolishing bridges,
how to cause trouble,

29:13.440 --> 29:15.640
quarrels on public transport,
that kind of thing.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.960
So here's how to sabotage
a lavatory.

29:17.960 --> 29:22.440
So, what you do is
you saturate a sponge, OK,

29:22.440 --> 29:25.440
with a thick starch
or sugar solution, right?

29:25.440 --> 29:28.840
You squeeze it tightly
until it is a ball.

29:28.840 --> 29:32.160
You wrap it with string to keep it
in the ball and then you let it dry.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.280
And once it is dry,
you remove the string

29:35.280 --> 29:37.880
and you flush it down the lavatory.

29:37.880 --> 29:41.800
The sponge will gradually expand
back to its normal size

29:41.800 --> 29:44.760
and it will entirely plug
the sewage system.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.600
Oh.
And why would you want to do that?

29:46.600 --> 29:48.840
Yeah, I was just...
If you want to mess with your enemy,

29:48.840 --> 29:51.280
mess with their toilets. Oh. Yeah.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.720
I mean, it's really simple. It's...

29:52.720 --> 29:55.920
Or just shit straight on their
faces from the stage! Exactly!

29:55.920 --> 29:58.120
You know. Cut out the middleman.

29:58.120 --> 30:02.560
So, some of the stuff they suggest,
it's like schoolboy pranks in here.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.760
Yeah. But it's just stuff that
the enemy would go,

30:04.760 --> 30:07.200
"Oh, now the toilets are backed up
in the main office!

30:07.200 --> 30:09.640
"It's just annoying."
So let's try.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.160
The lighting system in a factory,

30:11.160 --> 30:13.760
how would you sabotage
the lighting system in a factory?

30:13.760 --> 30:17.520
Cut a wire? No, it's got to be more
subtle than that, you see. Oh.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.480
So what you do is, you turn the
lights off, unscrew a light bulb,

30:20.480 --> 30:23.200
put a coin into the socket,
put the light bulb back in again.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.880
As soon as somebody turns it on,
the whole system will blow.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.520
Because of the copper. Yeah.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.440
I mean, it's... I'm going to do that
to some of my mates' houses. Don't,

30:30.440 --> 30:33.400
I mean, it's terrible. Electricians
and plumbers back in the day would

30:33.400 --> 30:35.960
have been making an absolute
killing. Yeah, just stick a coin

30:35.960 --> 30:38.720
in it. "Oh, it's a sponge, it's a
coin," and they charge you 600 quid

30:38.720 --> 30:41.200
for the privilege. What about
the petrol tank of a vehicle?

30:41.200 --> 30:42.400
Oh, that's sugar, isn't it?

30:42.400 --> 30:45.160
You can do sugar or you can urinate
in it, if you haven't got sugar.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.600
Oh. Urine?! Yeah, just wee in it.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.360
I don't know why
I'm giving all this away.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.920
Please don't do any of these things.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.400
I've heard of them putting,
like, a potato in the exhaust.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.560
Yeah, I've heard of that.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.560
I like this, the one in here that
I think would only work in Britain.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.000
"To start an argument on a train,
if you work for the railway,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.040
"issue two tickets
for the same seat." Ah, yes.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.800
That's every day. Yeah. Yes.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.640
Moving on.
What use are shadows anyway?

31:08.640 --> 31:10.920
Oh, look at them! Oh.

31:10.920 --> 31:14.520
It is nothing to do with music,
it is everything to do with...

31:14.520 --> 31:16.240
What would you use a shadow for?

31:16.240 --> 31:20.600
Discipline. What? Is that what
they called the cane in your school?

31:20.600 --> 31:22.680
The shadow? No, no, no.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.480
"You will see the shadow, my
friend!"

31:25.480 --> 31:27.720
No, no, no.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.880
When I was like six or seven years
old, I used to go to mosque

31:30.880 --> 31:33.800
and before we used to go for the
evening prayers at sunset, we

31:33.800 --> 31:36.680
would hang out in the park because
we were cool, young Muslim boys.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.960
And on one particular day,
one of the kids said,

31:39.960 --> 31:43.960
"The longer your shadow is,
the more sin you've committed.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.520
"So you are going to go to hell."

31:45.520 --> 31:48.120
And so, of course, as the sun was
setting, our shadows get longer

31:48.120 --> 31:49.720
and you would see six or seven of us

31:49.720 --> 31:53.720
just running around trying to get
the shadow as small as possible.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.440
Then... I found bacon and so...

31:59.280 --> 32:01.720
It's weird you can use your shadow
to work out what time it is.

32:01.720 --> 32:05.240
It is to do with time,
so I have here, for example,

32:05.240 --> 32:08.040
a pocket sundial.

32:08.040 --> 32:11.120
And if you raise up this little
part here,

32:11.120 --> 32:12.520
you would be able to tell the...

32:12.520 --> 32:14.920
I mean, you could just wear a watch,
is the other way of doing it.

32:14.920 --> 32:18.120
But this is an old way of doing it.
It's got a compass and a shadow.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.760
The thing about this is
it would give

32:19.760 --> 32:21.560
a very crude approximation
of the time.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.760
The larger it is, the more
accurate it is going to be.

32:23.760 --> 32:27.720
The one that possibly would give you
the best time at 22.6m,

32:27.720 --> 32:30.040
it is about 75 foot high - Vrihat
Samrat Yantra.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.600
It is the "great king of
instruments" in Jaipur.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.200
It was completed in 1734

32:35.200 --> 32:37.640
and it gives the time accurate to
two seconds.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.080
Wow. Wow.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.800
I know! It's amazing. So the shadow
moves at a millimetre per second.

32:41.800 --> 32:45.240
It is fast enough to see. I think
that is incredible.

32:45.240 --> 32:48.600
And then the shadow of the even
taller Sundial Bridge,

32:48.600 --> 32:51.200
that is over the Sacramento River
in Redding, California,

32:51.200 --> 32:54.280
moves at 5mm/s.
It's a stunning thing.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.440
That one, in Sacramento? Yes.
Well, it's in Redding, California.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.480
It is the Sacramento River.

32:59.480 --> 33:00.960
Smaller, but no less impressive,

33:00.960 --> 33:03.000
and I certainly would like one for
the garden,

33:03.000 --> 33:04.200
were the sundial cannons.

33:04.200 --> 33:08.480
This is a sort of niche accessory
from the 17th to the 19th century.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.520
It is a sundial with a magnifying
glass positioned on it

33:12.520 --> 33:14.800
to concentrate the sun's
rays at midday.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.200
So that it would go down onto some
gunpowder and fire a cannon!

33:18.200 --> 33:19.760
Who doesn't want one of those?!

33:19.760 --> 33:21.680
You wouldn't want to be
standing in front of it. No.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.240
There was one in the Palais Royal
in Paris.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.080
Used to go off at midday.
People used to go and watch.

33:27.080 --> 33:30.200
And the only one remaining that is
functioning is the sun

33:30.200 --> 33:32.560
cannon in Atvidaberg, Sweden.

33:32.560 --> 33:35.080
You can use shadows to power
a digital watch.

33:35.080 --> 33:38.080
So the scientists at the
University of Singapore have

33:38.080 --> 33:40.800
unveiled their shadow-effect
energy generator.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.000
And when it is completely in shadow
or fully in light,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.600
it produces a very low amount
of electricity or nothing at all

33:45.600 --> 33:48.640
and it is the contrast between
shadow and light that makes it work.

33:48.640 --> 33:52.920
And it generates enough current to
power a digital watch.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.440
Why is it best to weigh
yourself in the dark?

33:55.440 --> 33:57.520
So you don't know how much
you have eaten?

33:59.160 --> 34:01.920
I presume when you say best, you
mean it gives you a lower reading?

34:01.920 --> 34:05.840
It does. So light falling onto
a surface exerts a tiny amount of
pressure.

34:05.840 --> 34:09.040
That's what it is. I know!
You would think...

34:09.040 --> 34:13.240
Your bathroom is too bright.
Too bright!

34:13.240 --> 34:14.880
Tiny amounts of pressure.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.680
If you remove light from a surface,
you remove that tiny

34:17.680 --> 34:21.960
amount of pressure and this pressure
can be used to power spacecraft.

34:21.960 --> 34:25.880
So the Japanese IKAROS is a
spacecraft that was launched

34:25.880 --> 34:27.840
in May 2010... Icarus?

34:27.840 --> 34:30.000
That is not a spacecraft
I would get on.

34:31.880 --> 34:36.080
Stands for the
Interplanetary Kite-craft
Accelerated by Radiation Of the Sun.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.640
Of course. It is an acronym.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.800
It has a 46 foot square sail,

34:39.800 --> 34:42.200
which uses light pressure plus
the solar wind

34:42.200 --> 34:43.680
as its means of propulsion.

34:43.680 --> 34:45.720
Wow, that's amazing. I know!

34:45.720 --> 34:47.520
Cos you only need a small amount
of power

34:47.520 --> 34:49.760
as there is no resistance in space.
So it's enough.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.920
And so we descend into the shadowy
realm of shaky misunderstandings

34:52.920 --> 34:54.840
that we call General Ignorance.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.640
Fingers on buzzers, please.

34:56.640 --> 34:59.240
I'm looking forward
to my summer holiday,

34:59.240 --> 35:02.960
how can I prepare to get a nice,
deep suntan without burning?

35:02.960 --> 35:05.760
Sun lotion?
Would you not, sun cream?

35:05.760 --> 35:09.200
Yes, probably the very correct
answer, my darling, yes.

35:09.200 --> 35:12.800
People used to think that the idea
was to lay down a sort of base tan,

35:12.800 --> 35:15.040
possibly in a tanning salon
or something.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.800
And it's a widespread thought,
but it is entirely wrong.

35:17.800 --> 35:21.160
The only way you can protect
yourself is with suntan lotion.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.960
Or clothes. Clothes, but not, or you
and I would just sit in the shade,

35:23.960 --> 35:26.080
wouldn't we, Alan? Drinking heavily.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.000
So they wanted to demonstrate this,
so they needed some skin that

35:29.000 --> 35:33.040
had zero exposure to the sun,
so they chose British bottoms.

35:33.040 --> 35:36.680
Yeah. And they were exposed
to simulated sunlight.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.920
They replicate conditions
at the centre of the Earth.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.160
I know, exactly.
Can I just say what an awful

35:41.160 --> 35:44.040
representation of the United States
of America that picture is?

35:44.040 --> 35:46.880
Yeah. It's not pretty, is it?
No! No.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.920
Would you or wouldn't you, Victoria?

35:51.800 --> 35:53.400
I think he looks all right.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.000
Anyway...

35:59.240 --> 36:02.520
Two weeks they spent with simulated
sunlight on naked buttocks,

36:02.520 --> 36:05.240
and the resulting tan gave them
a tiny bit of protection.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.120
Basically it meant you could spend
an extra ten minutes in the sun.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.080
And tanning parlour sun beds
are really as bad

36:11.080 --> 36:12.880
if not worse than natural sunlight.

36:12.880 --> 36:16.920
Indeed, indoor tanning causes
about 420,000 cases of skin cancer

36:16.920 --> 36:19.720
a year in the US alone. What?!
Yeah.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.200
If you go to indoor tanning place

36:21.200 --> 36:23.840
and you think that is going to save
you from getting skin cancer because

36:23.840 --> 36:27.360
you've got a base tan, it probably
is going to exacerbate the chances

36:27.360 --> 36:29.520
of you getting skin cancer
because you think you are safe,

36:29.520 --> 36:31.560
so you think you can lie
out in the sun for a bit longer.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.920
And I'm from Essex, so this is
a good public service message.

36:33.920 --> 36:37.880
Yes, darling. And you're the one
who said suntan lotion,
so well done you! Thank you.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.840
Now, why do you call it the dark
side of the moon?

36:42.560 --> 36:47.200
Oh, The Clangers, look at them!
HE IMITATES THE CLANGERS

36:47.200 --> 36:49.360
Because it's the title of the album.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.640
Which album, darling?
The Pink Floyd album.

36:51.640 --> 36:56.000
OK, in the words of Pink Floyd,
there is no dark side of the moon.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.440
The reason we can't see the far
side of the moon is that the moon

36:59.440 --> 37:02.640
is tidally locked to the Earth.
So let me show you.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.840
Oh, I love a visual.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.880
So, here is the moon and you can see

37:07.880 --> 37:10.120
that it is facing towards the Earth.

37:10.120 --> 37:13.280
You can't see that arrow, can you,
because where we are on Earth,

37:13.280 --> 37:15.440
you just see the point of it,
but it is invisible.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.840
But it is there!

37:15.440 --> 37:17.840
LAUGHTER

37:17.840 --> 37:20.720
If you look at the moon,

37:20.720 --> 37:25.000
because of the way the moon orbits
the Earth, we only ever see one

37:25.000 --> 37:28.960
side of it, but that doesn't mean
that the unseen side is always dark.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.320
Because the moon is orbiting the
Earth and they are both orbiting the

37:32.320 --> 37:35.480
Sun, so all the sides of the moon
end up facing the Sun

37:35.480 --> 37:36.920
at various times.

37:36.920 --> 37:40.360
There are bits of the moon
which are in permanent darkness.

37:40.360 --> 37:43.320
There's a sort of crater
of eternal darkness.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.120
It is a bit like why Lochranza is
Shady Town, where we started.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.560
"Crater of eternal darkness."

37:48.560 --> 37:50.040
I'm going to call my house that.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.760
Crater of eternal darkness!

37:52.760 --> 37:56.360
"Hello, crater of eternal darkness.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.840
"Yes, we deliver."

37:57.840 --> 38:00.360
It's a great name for a restaurant.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.640
It's a place called the Shackleton
crater at the moon's South Pole

38:03.640 --> 38:06.120
and it receives no sunlight

38:06.120 --> 38:08.520
because it is so deep
and so close to the pole.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.760
The opposite of this is
the peak of eternal light, which is

38:10.760 --> 38:12.040
what I'm going to call my house.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.240
Somewhere where there is
always sunlight

38:14.240 --> 38:16.360
and we haven't found that
yet on the moon.

38:16.360 --> 38:19.240
Oddly enough, the rim of the
Shackleton crater gets pretty close,

38:19.240 --> 38:21.280
it is sunny 94% of the time.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.800
But the actual crater itself is...
Is not.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.600
Is not at all.

38:25.600 --> 38:30.720
Now, pause for thought. What happens
to your pores in a sauna?

38:30.720 --> 38:34.800
When they warm up, do they open up
and when it is cold they close up?

38:34.800 --> 38:36.840
KLAXON SOUNDS

38:34.800 --> 38:36.840
Yes.

38:39.760 --> 38:40.880
OK, so here is the thing.

38:40.880 --> 38:44.080
Pores allow us to sweat and
so that regulates body temperature.

38:44.080 --> 38:47.200
But they don't have muscles.
They cannot open and close.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.760
So if you want to use warm water,
for example,

38:49.760 --> 38:52.200
that cleans your pores,
it doesn't change their size.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.240
At all. OK.

38:53.240 --> 38:56.480
They do and can
increase in size as you age,

38:56.480 --> 39:01.760
but it has nothing to do with your
washing regime in any way.

39:01.760 --> 39:05.320
I love watching videos on...

39:05.320 --> 39:08.200
No, not...

39:05.320 --> 39:08.200
LAUGHTER

39:08.200 --> 39:12.360
Key change. That's another story.
LAUGHTER

39:12.360 --> 39:14.440
You know how people watch like,
hear certain sounds

39:14.440 --> 39:16.600
and it soothes them
and it calms them?

39:16.600 --> 39:20.320
I watch videos of people
popping pimples.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.520
What?! They are very popular.
I watch them too.

39:23.520 --> 39:26.000
But why would you watch...
Why would you watch that?!

39:26.000 --> 39:28.360
I don't know. I don't understand it
myself,

39:28.360 --> 39:31.680
but I found out just by one
night going...

39:31.680 --> 39:34.480
There is a show called Dr Pimple
Popper... Yes. Oh, my God.

39:34.480 --> 39:37.040
I thought, I'm going to search
this on YouTube and, Oh, my God,

39:37.040 --> 39:38.280
it is a whole community!

39:38.280 --> 39:40.080
Do you ever pick your spots or
blackheads?

39:40.080 --> 39:43.600
I don't have spots or blackheads -
I'm 4,000 years old!

39:43.600 --> 39:47.360
LAUGHTER

39:47.360 --> 39:49.840
The pores are always with us, sadly.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.320
Now, this is exciting,

39:51.320 --> 39:54.480
we've done a bit of research
on who is in line for the throne,

39:54.480 --> 39:57.040
and we know the correct answer
to this question.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.400
Which of you on this panel
is closest to inheriting the crown?

40:00.400 --> 40:02.240
I look good.

40:02.240 --> 40:04.480
I think we all deserve
a "yas queen."

40:04.480 --> 40:06.200
Yas.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.520
KLAXON, LAUGHTER

40:11.440 --> 40:13.400
I love it, I'm a klaxon!

40:13.400 --> 40:16.080
It must be Alan.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.840
KLAXON

40:17.840 --> 40:20.160
Well... Well, it MUST be.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.480
Explain how it's not Alan.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.760
Here's the truth of it,
it's none of us. No, it can't be

40:23.760 --> 40:26.200
none of us, you said,
"Who's the closest?" Yeah, closest.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.800
We could all be far away,
but somebody must... No. No?

40:28.800 --> 40:30.480
Nobody. No. Most people think that

40:30.480 --> 40:32.360
we're all somehow in line
to the throne

40:32.360 --> 40:35.280
eventually, even if you're number
52 million and 14 or whatever.

40:35.280 --> 40:38.960
Yeah. In fact, the list of
succession is extremely limited.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.040
You have to be a direct descendent

40:41.040 --> 40:43.680
of Princess Sophia,
Electress of Hanover,

40:43.680 --> 40:45.680
who was born in The Hague in 1630.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.160
Oh, Great-granny Sophia?!

40:50.160 --> 40:52.120
That's where the family hair began.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.240
It could be as well!

40:56.240 --> 40:59.600
This was painted just a week
after she shat on Hampstead Heath.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.240
Do you not think it's weird that
she looks surprised

41:04.240 --> 41:07.440
to be having her portrait done?!
She's going, "Oh, really?!"

41:07.440 --> 41:09.360
I like the look of her.
She is rather fun.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.160
She was the granddaughter
of James I,

41:11.160 --> 41:13.840
so she was chosen as heir to the
throne to ensure a Protestant

41:13.840 --> 41:17.720
lineage in the event that William
or Queen Anne died without issue.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.880
And it was to block
the Old Pretender, James Stuart,

41:20.880 --> 41:22.120
who was a Catholic.

41:22.120 --> 41:24.880
Unfortunately, she died two months
before she was due to take over,

41:24.880 --> 41:26.000
so we got her son, George I.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.760
And it's a shame
because she was extraordinary.

41:28.760 --> 41:31.800
She spoke five languages,
she was educated in theology,

41:31.800 --> 41:33.560
history, mathematics, law.

41:33.560 --> 41:37.040
She was buried in
the Berggarten Mausoleum in Hanover

41:37.040 --> 41:38.120
and ironically,

41:38.120 --> 41:41.000
considering that all British Royalty
is descended from her, that was

41:41.000 --> 41:43.560
almost completely destroyed by
Allied bombers during World War II.

41:43.560 --> 41:46.120
Wow. Buckingham Palace has never
published a full record of Sophia's

41:46.120 --> 41:48.960
descendants, but two American men
did a full investigation

41:48.960 --> 41:52.040
and they both independently
found that the last

41:52.040 --> 41:53.560
person in line to the throne,

41:53.560 --> 41:59.280
the 4,973rd, is a German pain
therapist called Karin Vogel.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.880
A German pain therapist? Yes.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.120
Try typing that into Google.
I know, right!

42:03.120 --> 42:06.560
LAUGHTER

42:06.560 --> 42:08.680
Goes straight to images.

42:08.680 --> 42:13.200
Which brings us to the scores.
Looking distinctly shaky in last
place,

42:13.200 --> 42:15.120
with minus seven,

42:15.120 --> 42:16.760
it's Alan.

42:16.760 --> 42:21.080
Thank you. Thank you.

42:16.760 --> 42:21.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

42:21.080 --> 42:24.000
Third place, with minus three,
Victoria. Hooray!

42:24.000 --> 42:26.760
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

42:28.360 --> 42:30.440
Second, with one point, John.

42:30.440 --> 42:33.280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

42:30.440 --> 42:33.280
Yas queen, yas queen!

42:33.280 --> 42:35.760
Yas queen, yas, yas, yas queen.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.760
But overshadowing everybody is
tonight's winner, with five points,

42:38.760 --> 42:41.480
Eshaan!

42:38.760 --> 42:41.480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

42:43.720 --> 42:45.720
No!

42:48.240 --> 42:50.800
My thanks to Victoria, Eshaan,
John and Alan.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.920
I leave you with
this shadowy sign-off

42:52.920 --> 42:55.640
from Chinese philosopher Lin Yutang.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.280
"When small men
begin to cast big shadows,

42:58.280 --> 43:01.320
"it means that
the sun is about to set."

43:01.320 --> 43:02.840
Goodnight.

43:02.840 --> 43:05.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
