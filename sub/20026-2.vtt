ROCKET: Well,
since we need a ton of credits
for our new ship

00:05.124 --> 00:07.499
and have zilch, we're
gonna have to actually
work for this.

00:08.666 --> 00:10.249
Let's check
the outstanding bounties.

00:11.666 --> 00:13.624
Too monstrous. Too deadly.

00:13.624 --> 00:15.790
Too ugly. Next.

00:15.790 --> 00:17.541
Wait. What?

00:17.541 --> 00:19.000
I am Groot.
Aw!

00:19.000 --> 00:20.832
It's cute, it's cuddly,

00:20.832 --> 00:22.666
and it's worth
a million credits.

00:22.666 --> 00:24.208
This bounty will be
a piece of cake.

00:38.374 --> 00:40.915
This planet is soft
and colorful and cute.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.499
And it's making me
krutackin' sick.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.749
Where is this little fur ball?

00:45.749 --> 00:47.124
Hello!

00:47.124 --> 00:48.624
Eh, nothing. This is
like trying to find

00:48.624 --> 00:50.457
a gum drop
in a candy store.

00:50.457 --> 00:51.541
Huh?

00:51.541 --> 00:52.707
(PURRING)

00:52.707 --> 00:54.666
Huh?
I am Groot.

00:54.666 --> 00:56.707

like his profile pic.

00:56.707 --> 00:58.374
ROCKET: We're gonna need
a bigger gun.

00:58.374 --> 01:00.541
