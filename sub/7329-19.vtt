WEBVTT

00:08.409 --> 00:10.987
Brett Lange the quarterback
is dating Stacy Miller?

00:11.011 --> 00:13.957
I swear to God, I saw his hand
on her butt, walking to French.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.158
Can we please talk
about something else?

00:15.182 --> 00:16.593
How about anything else?

00:16.617 --> 00:18.795
Look at this picture
I found on her Facebook page.

00:18.819 --> 00:19.820
She's so nasty.

00:21.121 --> 00:22.432
Skanky and ugly.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.633
Skugly.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.858
Look out!

00:27.895 --> 00:30.640
I swear, I barely hit him.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.942
Oh, my God.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.110
Let's go check.

00:34.134 --> 00:35.499
I can't believe this.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.382
Whoa!

00:39.406 --> 00:40.984
Oh, my God. Did I do that?

00:41.008 --> 00:41.985
No.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.319
He's been stabbed.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.221
Call 911.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.303
Get off Facebook and dial!

01:25.786 --> 01:26.896
Good morning, Tony.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.665
Is it, Tim?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.433
Well, I don't see
why it wouldn't be.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.402
- What's wrong?
- You stood me up last night.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.571
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.072
No, I did not, Tony.
What is today?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.274
Today is the day

01:37.298 --> 01:39.042
after the night when you
were supposed to meet me

01:39.066 --> 01:41.011
at the bar at the
Air and Space Museum.

01:41.035 --> 01:42.679
Are you two dating now?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.281
No. Tony is using me
as his pimp.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.083
I went to college with a girl
who works at the museum.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.852
Ms. Lunar Modules.
That's her specialty.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.253
Tony wants me to introduce them.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.354
To fix them up.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.456
Tony needs help with a woman?

01:53.480 --> 01:56.626
No. I needed a geek wingman.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.927
McGeek qualifies.

01:57.951 --> 01:58.928
See that, Tony?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.563
This shows that tomorrow night

02:00.587 --> 02:02.565
is when we're supposed
to get together, okay?

02:02.589 --> 02:04.834
I sent you 15 texts.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.436
I sat there for three hours.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.937
I waited for you. I called.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.860
I was in the bathtub.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.243
Why do you do that?

02:13.267 --> 02:14.611
Every morning I come in here,

02:14.635 --> 02:16.980
you got one of those donuts
with the sprinkles on it,

02:17.004 --> 02:19.249
and you spend half an hour
picking all those sprinkles off.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.650
Yeah? What's your point?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.452
Why don't you just buy one
without the sprinkles?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.154
Why don't you just stay
out of my business?

02:24.178 --> 02:26.146
It's part of my ritual.
What do you care?

02:27.214 --> 02:28.692
And the little
huffing and puffing...

02:28.716 --> 02:30.260
What, are you trying
to blow the coffee down?

02:30.284 --> 02:32.753
Why not one long blow?

02:35.122 --> 02:36.099
DiNozzo.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.334
Hey, DiNozzo. It's McGee.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.735
Listen, I have to cancel
tomorrow night.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.919
Have a good day.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.208
Not answering.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.209
Answer it.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.233
Nope.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.815
You and me, McGee...

02:51.839 --> 02:53.817
we're done.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.951
No argument here.

02:54.975 --> 02:55.985
You know what, you two?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.253
I have actually heard of this.

02:57.277 --> 03:00.824
You two are having
a seven-year bitch.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.127
Itch. And yes, we are.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.562
You two are like
a married couple.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.330
Oh, no, they're not.
They're still speaking.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.698
Let's go. Grab your gear.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.984
Got a dead sailor in Norfolk.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.476
Victim is Navy
Lieutenant Justin Moss.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.811
Worked for the Office
of Public Affairs.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.279
Married, no children.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.348
This is his house.
First he gets stabbed,

03:25.372 --> 03:27.083
then he's hit by a car.
That's a rough day.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.352
Yeah, well, whoever
stabbed him used a big knife.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.422
Like a combat knife or a kukri.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.890
- Kukri?
- Yeah.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.292
It's a weapon used by
the Gurkhas to great effect.

03:36.316 --> 03:39.462
Though I doubt a Gurkha
had anything to do with this.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.331
Well, the kids
in the car say that Moss

03:41.355 --> 03:43.133
- wandered into the street.
- You check his house?

03:43.157 --> 03:45.034
Ziva's in there now.
Looked clean.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.603
No blood. Wife's not at home.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.538
Blood drop pattern does indicate

03:48.562 --> 03:50.473
that he was walking
toward his house, boss.

03:50.497 --> 03:54.043
Well, severe loss of blood
can lead to disorientation.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.945
It's well documented.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.314
There was a case in New York...
the victim of a car crash.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.283
He staggered home, went to bed,

04:00.307 --> 04:02.185
and awoke
the next morning to find

04:02.209 --> 04:03.186
his left hand missing.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.521
Maybe he was a righty.

04:04.545 --> 04:05.955
He bled to death, Duck.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.390
Yeah. Not here.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.993
Our lieutenant
was stabbed elsewhere.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.195
His clothes are soaked, but
there's no blood on the road.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.997
It's not our crime scene, huh?

04:14.021 --> 04:15.298
No, afraid not.

04:15.322 --> 04:17.000
Blood trail heads up the hill.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.802
Go.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.204
Hey, McGee. Go.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.139
Together?

04:23.163 --> 04:24.163
Yeah, together. Go.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.645
Hey.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.181
Why'd the dead guy
cross the road?

04:31.205 --> 04:33.316
To get home.

04:33.340 --> 04:36.935
Yeah. You were funnier
when you were fatter.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.525
-Well, well.
What do we have here?

04:42.549 --> 04:44.327
Well, I guess we've
found our crime scene.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.428
- Got I.D.'s?
- Hey.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.443
NCIS.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.934
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.903
Here's our blood trail all
the way through the forest

04:53.927 --> 04:55.705
to a motel...

04:55.729 --> 04:57.707
DiNozzo. McGee.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.909
I was wondering when you
were going to show up.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.045
Dispatcher said NCIS
wasn't far away.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.346
Detective McCadden.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.682
We got a body, if you
got a crime scene.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.584
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.886
Whoa. Silence of the Lambs.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.378
Nice movie reference.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.123
And a nice Chianti.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.291
Yeah, we're going
to need everything

05:15.315 --> 05:16.559
you've processed so far.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.927
He knows the drill, Tim.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.028
What do you got, McC?

05:19.052 --> 05:20.052
Follow me.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.455
McC...

05:27.661 --> 05:29.706
Looks like something
out of Kill Bill.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.174
- Volume 1.
- Volume 1.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.375
Nice.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.731
Room was rented to Justin Moss.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.213
That's our victim.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.748
Housekeeping called it in
when they found the mess.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.416
Found a few hair samples.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.152
No prints, but...
got a wine bottle

05:43.176 --> 05:44.554
and a couple of glasses.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.456
Dead guy had company.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.525
- Ma'am...
- Justin?!

05:48.549 --> 05:49.993
Ma'am, this is a secured area!

05:50.017 --> 05:51.794
- Justin?
- Ma'am, stay back.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.763
- Justin?! Oh, my God!
- Ma'am...

05:53.787 --> 05:55.798
Ma'am, we're going to have
to ask you to step back.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.500
- This is a crime scene.
- I'm Emily Moss.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.801
Where's my husband?
What happened?

05:58.825 --> 06:01.170
Your husband is
Lieutenant Justin Moss?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.539
Yes. I was supposed
to come pick him up.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.573
He was meeting someone here.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.241
Do you know who?

06:05.265 --> 06:07.790
Of course.
He was with a prostitute.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.290
I just don't understand
how this could have happened.

06:20.314 --> 06:23.826
If that tramp touched my
husband, I'm going to kill her.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.229
But you knew he was meeting
with an escort.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.463
Yes.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.700
Justin was a reporter
for the Navy Herald.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.768
He was doing a piece

06:31.792 --> 06:33.403
on high-priced call girls in
Norfolk.

06:33.427 --> 06:37.740
So, he was interviewing
escorts for his story.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.375
Justin wanted to write

06:39.399 --> 06:40.843
about how they lived,
how they worked,

06:40.867 --> 06:44.314
how Norfolk's Navy population
influenced their business.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.983
He was very professional
about it.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.785
Did he, by any chance,
give you the name of,

06:48.809 --> 06:50.453
uh, the woman
he was interviewing?

06:50.477 --> 06:53.156
No, but he'd spoken
with her a few times.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.292
So, it was
an ongoing assignment?

06:56.316 --> 06:59.228
Justin would never cheat on me.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.164
If that's what
you're implying...

07:01.188 --> 07:04.680
No, ma'am. Um, absolutely not.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.740
Clean service record;

07:10.764 --> 07:13.476
No criminal activity;
Worked as a journalist

07:13.500 --> 07:16.145
for the Navy Herald as
well as his assignment

07:16.169 --> 07:17.513
at Norfolk Naval Air Base.

07:17.537 --> 07:18.715
How about the woman he was with?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.450
She's still unidentified.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.051
According to Moss's
banking records,

07:22.075 --> 07:23.853
he made a $1,000 cash withdrawal

07:23.877 --> 07:25.555
just before meeting her
in the motel room.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.457
Journalists don't pay
for interviews.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.125
Well, two more withdrawals
were made

07:29.149 --> 07:30.393
in the same amount
in the last month.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.729
Wonder what a grand buys you
these days.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.832
Anyway... I'm looking at Moss's
date planner here, boss.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.200
The dates of his
cash withdrawals

07:37.224 --> 07:39.068
correspond to days
he met with his source.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.770
All previous meetings have been

07:40.794 --> 07:42.972
at a bar in Norfolk
called The Liberty Square.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.540
Check the security
cameras from the bar.

07:44.564 --> 07:45.875
We need an I.D.
on our missing woman.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.010
Maybe the wife put an end

07:47.034 --> 07:48.578
to her husband's
investigative probing

07:48.602 --> 07:50.847
with a steak knife.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.048
The bad stuff
is easier to believe.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.050
That's a line from Pretty Woman.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.519
I have a call in to Justin's
editor at the Navy Herald.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.553
Take McGee with you.

07:57.577 --> 07:58.821
DiNozzo.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.057
Look into any similar homicides
in the Norfolk area

08:01.081 --> 08:02.859
in the past 12 to 18 months.
Will do, boss.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.761
Go with McCadden. I want you two
working together on this.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.345
Ah. I like that.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.769
Murdered?!

08:12.793 --> 08:14.370
Huh... I'm surprised
your newspaper's

08:14.394 --> 08:16.039
not already covering it.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.440
Lieutenant Moss was writing

08:17.464 --> 08:18.908
a story on escorts in Norfolk?

08:18.932 --> 08:20.476
Yeah. Justin was fascinated.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.711
He had this grand idea

08:21.735 --> 08:23.346
to turn the article
into some in-depth exposé.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.015
Well, we're going to need a copy
of the story and any notes...

08:26.039 --> 08:27.417
He hadn't turned
anything in yet.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.752
Did you know that he was paying
to spend time with her?

08:29.776 --> 08:31.020
It's not uncommon for a reporter

08:31.044 --> 08:32.755
to throw around a few bucks
to get a story.

08:32.779 --> 08:35.679
Moss paid $1,000
every time they met.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.361
The lines between
business and pleasure

08:39.385 --> 08:41.130
can sometimes get blurred.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.399
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to get back to work.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.467
Deadlines.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.221
Yes. Lieutenant Moss met his.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.386
Yeah.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.576
Abby?

08:53.600 --> 08:55.812
No time for small talk, Gibbs.
There's way to much to tell.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.146
I only said "Abby," Abby.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.581
Well, now you've said it thrice.

08:58.605 --> 09:02.118
I have been scrubbing through
the motel security footage.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.088
It's grainy
and it's from far away,

09:05.112 --> 09:07.740
but you can see a female-ish
hunk of pixels coming...

09:10.684 --> 09:12.328
and then going, an hour later.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.330
Plenty of time
for a little hanky-panky

09:14.354 --> 09:15.865
with our dead journalist
before she killed him.

09:15.889 --> 09:16.999
Oh, if she did it.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.668
And by "did it," I mean
if she killed him,

09:18.692 --> 09:19.936
not "did it" like
if she did it...

09:19.960 --> 09:20.937
You got her name?

09:20.961 --> 09:23.940
Okay, motel footage? Not so hot.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.942
But the footage that
McGee got from the bar...

09:25.966 --> 09:27.243
muy caliente.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.678
Using Moss' calendar,

09:28.702 --> 09:31.581
I was able to match a previous
date and time of a meeting

09:31.605 --> 09:33.685
between the lieutenant
and our mystery woman, thus...

09:34.508 --> 09:35.485
Voilà.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.819
Her face on file?

09:36.843 --> 09:38.087
Charlotte Cook.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.523
She was busted for prostitution
two years ago.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.492
If you get me a DNA sample,

09:42.516 --> 09:44.827
I could match that to the hairs
that we found in the motel,

09:44.851 --> 09:46.229
and we can put her
at the crime scene.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.297
She's been arrested before
and her DNA's not on file?

09:48.321 --> 09:51.000
Yeah. She must have had
a really good lawyer.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.168
She was bailed out
in a heartbeat,

09:52.192 --> 09:53.336
and all the charges
were dropped.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.805
Gibbs.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.626
Guess who she used to work for?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.845
Holly Snow.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.547
The former DC madam.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.015
You should talk to her, Gibbs.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.183
Look, she's giving seminars

10:07.207 --> 10:09.552
on sexual harassment
to government employees

10:09.576 --> 10:10.953
as part of her plea deal.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.288
Right. Community service.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.491
I guess she... she would know
a lot about sex, huh?

10:15.515 --> 10:17.560
- And harassment.
- Huh.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.228
I don't think
I could be an escort.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.663
I'm really friendly

10:20.687 --> 10:22.165
and-and I'm a really
good listener

10:22.189 --> 10:23.366
and I like men,

10:23.390 --> 10:25.334
but... Ooh.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.602
- Abby?
- Yes?

10:26.626 --> 10:27.637
Find Charlotte Cook.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.151
Right.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.177
Bullitt. Escape From Alcatraz.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.113
I'm tempted
to go with Dirty Harry.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.584
But I'm going to say the best
film set in San Francisco is...

10:41.608 --> 10:42.608
Vertigo.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.355
Phil. Finally, somebody gets it.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.624
Hey, they're showing
a restored print of Road Warrior

10:48.648 --> 10:50.259
in Norfolk on Friday.
You want to go?

10:50.283 --> 10:51.594
Just walk away.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.730
I'll spare your lives...
that fat tank of gas.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.699
Humongous. Yes, we're going!

10:56.723 --> 10:58.167
Detective McCadden...

10:58.191 --> 11:00.736
You can call him "McC."

11:00.760 --> 11:02.939
These show that you have

11:02.963 --> 11:04.340
unsolved homicides

11:04.364 --> 11:06.142
of a similar nature to this one.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.277
Three previous murders
in Norfolk

11:08.301 --> 11:09.579
in the past six months.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.948
All males,
all stabbed in the back.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.649
And all with the same
wound patterns.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.984
You have a multiple offender.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.853
We have a multiple offender.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.708
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

11:20.280 --> 11:21.457
Ah! Jethro!

11:21.481 --> 11:25.261
Now, the only pertinent
news I have for you is that

11:25.285 --> 11:27.663
our reporter
did not have relations

11:27.687 --> 11:30.066
with his escort
before his death.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.267
He wasn't paying for it, Duck?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.870
Her time, yes; Her body, no.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.638
He was telling
his wife the truth.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.040
Our missing woman could be
killing off her clients.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.342
Why?

11:39.366 --> 11:40.443
Robbery, revenge, resentment.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.612
I don't think
you can rule out fetish.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.180
Yeah, McGee.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.315
Boss, Charlotte Cook
moved out of her apartment

11:46.339 --> 11:47.416
eight months ago.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.484
There's no credit card trail,

11:48.508 --> 11:49.819
no phone in her legal name.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.538
She is off the grid.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.358
Women interpret things
differently than men.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.525
A glance...

11:56.549 --> 11:58.828
a smile...

11:58.852 --> 12:01.964
can all be taken
in different ways.

12:01.988 --> 12:06.002
We have to be careful
what we say and how we say it...

12:06.026 --> 12:08.495
as some of my former clients
could easily attest.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.874
However, the, uh,

12:11.898 --> 12:16.169
the importance
of maintaining a...

12:17.370 --> 12:20.116
comfortable workplace
cannot be downplayed.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.851
Something I've always taken
seriously,

12:21.875 --> 12:24.487
regardless of what line
of work I was in.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.480
Why don't we go ahead and take
a, um, ten-minute break?

12:30.016 --> 12:31.560
That was interesting.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.528
- Um...
- Thanks.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.296
You're welcome.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.320
Yeah.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.216
Agent Gibbs.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.237
Are you checking up on me?

12:41.261 --> 12:42.505
No.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.675
You know I never did, um,
thank you for the jewelry.

12:45.699 --> 12:48.210
I usually prefer
Tiffany's, but, um...

12:48.234 --> 12:51.080
I can wear this in the bathtub.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.749
Well, I wouldn't
complain, Holly.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.117
Suspended sentence,
no prison time.

12:55.141 --> 12:56.519
You got off pretty easy.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.854
Yeah, you try not
being able to go

12:58.878 --> 13:00.523
more than two miles
from your home someday.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.391
Oh, I did. Little beach shack
in Mexico called

13:02.415 --> 13:03.893
"retirement." I liked it.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.194
Oh. And why'd you jump back in?

13:05.218 --> 13:07.463
Not here to talk about me.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.717
Why are you here?

13:11.725 --> 13:14.216
I need to find Charlotte Cook.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.975
Well, I'm sorry.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.242
I can't help you.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.277
Part of my sentence

13:21.301 --> 13:22.941
was to stay away
from my former employees.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.515
- Why, is she in trouble?
- Yeah.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.551
She's a suspect in four murders.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.887
No, no, it's not possible.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.657
I know the women
I used to work with.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.259
Well, then...

13:37.283 --> 13:38.894
you know where she is.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.853
Gibbs, if you couldn't find her,
what makes you think that I can?

13:45.525 --> 13:47.083
Although...

13:49.662 --> 13:51.273
Although...

13:51.297 --> 13:52.675
it's gonna cost me?

13:52.699 --> 13:55.778
Oh, my rates have
always been very reasonable,

13:55.802 --> 13:57.380
Special Agent Gibbs.

13:57.404 --> 14:01.431
I'm just looking
for... a little change of pace.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.935
And this...

14:16.523 --> 14:18.200
That's a deal-breaker.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.215
You need me, Gibbs.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.525
Use me.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.882
Okay.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.635
How do we find her?

14:36.242 --> 14:38.554
Put me back in business.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.443
She'll find me.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.701
You want to do what?!

14:52.725 --> 14:54.503
Don't want to. Need to.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.872
A lot of important people
worked very hard

14:56.896 --> 15:00.409
to get Holly Snow her plea deal
so that she would go away.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.577
Well, she's back.

15:01.601 --> 15:02.878
They buried Holly and they

15:02.902 --> 15:03.979
buried her little black book,

15:04.003 --> 15:05.648
and you want to put her
back in business?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.716
Holly gets us Charlotte.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.020
So you think that
when word gets out,

15:11.044 --> 15:13.489
Charlotte's gonna
magically call her?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.024
No, nothing magic about it.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.926
Holly's departure was pretty
high-profile.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.694
People are gonna buy
that she's back?

15:18.718 --> 15:20.496
Think they'll want to.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.664
All right, then what?

15:21.688 --> 15:22.865
Holly arranges a date.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.333
We bust Charlotte
for solicitation.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.401
We bring her in.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.803
Which gives us the right
to test her DNA.

15:27.827 --> 15:30.606
If it matches the hairs
found in the motel room...

15:30.630 --> 15:31.740
We have our killer.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.409
Or we might have someone
that saw him.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.711
Either way, you have leverage
on Charlotte,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.413
- and she has to cooperate.
- That's the plan.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.548
Well, that's easier said
than done.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.917
It's sex, Leon.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.205
Ain't nothin' easy about sex.

15:53.419 --> 15:54.530
Am I interrupting?

15:54.554 --> 15:57.466
No, we have hit a lull.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.636
Miss Snow's been back
in business for one hour.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.738
We've received 16 calls,
and none of them are Charlotte.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.074
You know, you would think
United States senators

16:05.098 --> 16:07.409
would use blocked numbers.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.231
Excuse me. I have to drop
these off to Autopsy.

16:12.438 --> 16:13.564
Hi.

16:14.607 --> 16:15.651
Hi.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.453
I'm Abby Sciuto.

16:17.477 --> 16:21.090
I've been, um, following
your... career.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.892
Am I flattered

16:22.916 --> 16:24.593
- or offended?
- Um...

16:24.617 --> 16:25.914
both.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.797
- Love your shoes.
- Love your shoes.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.766
Um, thanks.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.135
They're Manuel Aries... Milan.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.236
Makes 'em by hand.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.605
Um, Gothic Sole, made by some

16:36.629 --> 16:38.274
big, heavy, loud
piece of machinery

16:38.298 --> 16:40.075
in, like, Malaysia.

16:40.099 --> 16:42.829
Is something on your mind, Abby?

16:44.370 --> 16:47.249
Oh, you have a problem
with my line of work.

16:47.273 --> 16:50.686
Do you have, uh, legal, moral

16:50.710 --> 16:52.521
or women's issues with it?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.456
All of the above.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.744
Yeah, me, too.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.286
And now I'm paying for it.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.587
Okay, this one's
a pre-paid cell.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.803
Hello.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.438
I'm sorry, I must have
the wrong number.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.439
Charlotte!

17:10.463 --> 17:12.942
- Holly?
- It's me. How are you?!

17:12.965 --> 17:15.144
I'm just fine! I'm doing well.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.811
Oh, good, good.

17:16.836 --> 17:17.980
So the rumors are true.

17:18.003 --> 17:20.281
Actually, I have somebody

17:20.306 --> 17:22.151
who would be interested
in meeting with you.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.819
Uh, light KB, possible MOX.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.387
Half around.

17:26.412 --> 17:29.091
- Sounds fun. Where?
- The Adams House Hotel.

17:29.115 --> 17:31.293
6:00, Room 1126.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.395
Ask for Eddie at
the concierge desk.

17:33.419 --> 17:34.430
He'll give you the key.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.864
It's good
to have you back, Holly.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.700
- It's good to be back.
- I'll call you later.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.419
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.942
It was nice
to meet you, Miss Snow...

17:46.966 --> 17:48.468
I think.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.217
Uh, Miss Snow,

17:55.241 --> 17:57.152
can I ask you a quick question?

17:57.176 --> 17:59.822
Um, when you told Charlotte
what the client wanted,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.156
you-you mentioned
a couple things:

18:01.180 --> 18:03.546
"KB. MOX. Half around."
What does that stuff mean?

18:10.523 --> 18:11.854
Check the Internet.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.974
Whoa, not there. She'll look.

18:18.998 --> 18:19.975
You've taught 'em well.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.177
Mmm, this is DC, Agent McGee.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.226
Everybody's looking
for dirt on everybody else.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.689
What in the world
did you do in there?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.324
Just freshening up.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.860
Actually cut myself shaving,
if you can believe it.

18:37.884 --> 18:41.263
Jasmine and ginger.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.631
Sure you're not

18:42.655 --> 18:45.000
compensating a little bit
with the jacket and everything?

18:45.024 --> 18:46.302
I saw a photo of this girl.

18:46.326 --> 18:49.371
She's used to the
upper-echelon clientele.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.507
Picked this up down in
the gift shop. It's classy.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.829
Uh, take it off, Hef.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.579
And, uh, God... mess up
your hair a little.

18:57.603 --> 18:58.604
Sweat.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.650
- Sweat?
- This place smells like a setup.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.385
A john acts like a john, okay?

19:03.409 --> 19:06.755
At these prices, he's not
looking to impress the girl.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.157
He wants to be impressed.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.225
This will kill the mouthwash
smell; Please drink it.

19:10.249 --> 19:13.595
That's rich, instructing a
DiNozzo how to act around women.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.030
What's the matter with you?

19:15.054 --> 19:16.632
You start acting like you don't
know what you're doing,

19:16.656 --> 19:19.234
and she's gonna find
an excuse to leave.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.437
Pretend like you've done
this before.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.706
What makes you think
I haven't done this before?

19:23.730 --> 19:26.756
Because you're wearing underwear
straight out of the package.

19:29.635 --> 19:32.281
You know, that could
have fallen out of the jacket,

19:32.305 --> 19:34.216
'cause it's new
from the gift shop, I...

19:34.240 --> 19:35.217
Right, right.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.652
Who do you think I am?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.654
I think you're a businessman
pressed for time,

19:38.678 --> 19:40.022
looking to have a little fun

19:40.046 --> 19:42.591
before you get on the train
back to Wilmington.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.727
She's here to make
you forget that she's an escort.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.328
She's faking; You're not.
You got it?

19:46.352 --> 19:48.731
A woman's never been able
to tell when I was faking.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.532
You gotta ask for
something off-menu,

19:50.556 --> 19:53.102
something, uh, spontaneous
that I didn't approve.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.603
She'll call me.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.238
She won't be able to reach me,

19:56.262 --> 19:58.741
and, uh, rather than refuse
the job...

19:58.765 --> 20:00.409
- Right.
- Right.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.745
So what exactly am I asking for?

20:02.769 --> 20:03.879
Here's your earwig.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.063
I'll let you know.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.257
Testing... this is
Very Special Agent DiNozzo.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.291
We're good.

20:16.315 --> 20:17.726
This had better work.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.047
Is that a threat?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.519
Come on in.

20:26.559 --> 20:30.461
Wow! I guess you're not
room service, huh?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.344
Now, listen...

20:35.368 --> 20:36.460
Shut up!

20:37.503 --> 20:39.214
It's fun to watch.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.705
You've been a bad boy.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.821
Tony,

20:45.845 --> 20:47.540
tell her you want
to change the menu.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.242
I want to change the menu.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.831
You want the spicy Canton.

20:55.855 --> 20:56.832
The what?

20:56.856 --> 20:58.448
Pardon?

21:01.661 --> 21:03.128
I want the spicy Canton.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.495
Please?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.766
Let me make a call.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.615
Okay, put the envelope
on the table

21:13.639 --> 21:14.936
and go into the bathroom.

21:16.309 --> 21:19.655
Hey, I'm just, uh...

21:19.679 --> 21:21.547
Daddy's gonna make wee-wee.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.259
Did he just really say that?

21:24.283 --> 21:26.819
Yeah, that's him improvising.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.865
You've reached my voicemail.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.224
Please leave a message.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.496
Okay, she's taking the money.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.722
Charlotte Cook, NCIS.

21:53.746 --> 21:54.857
You're under arrest.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.159
It's not what you think, Char.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.878
Then what is it, Holly?

22:00.219 --> 22:01.864
I trusted you.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.321
I know.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.486
Char, I'm sorry.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.508
Well, I guess she'll never
know what she missed.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.076
Or how lucky she is.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.446
I'm just going to take
a cold shower, boss.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.528
Whoo.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.123
Special Agent Gibbs, your
little sting was entrapment.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.491
Come on. We're leaving.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.693
Sit down, Dwight.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.896
Ms. Cook did nothing wrong.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.198
She's a prostitute.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.766
Was a prostitute.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.202
She thought the envelope
that she found was lost.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.537
She intended on
turning it back in.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.505
You have no grounds
on which to hold my client.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.156
How about murder?

22:47.433 --> 22:49.526
Four murders, to be exact.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.686
I've also got your client

22:57.710 --> 22:59.688
meeting with
Lieutenant Justin Moss.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.623
Hair found at the motel
where he was killed

23:01.647 --> 23:03.258
matches your client's.

23:03.282 --> 23:04.960
You were the last one
to see Moss alive.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.362
So she was there.
Circumstantial.

23:07.386 --> 23:11.900
Look, these three were clients,
but not the reporter.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.769
We just talked.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.071
He was nice enough,
so I didn't mind.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.140
No one had ever wanted
to know my story before,

23:18.164 --> 23:19.207
and I just wanted...

23:19.231 --> 23:20.642
Stop talking.

23:20.666 --> 23:21.928
What happened at the motel?

23:23.569 --> 23:24.980
You say something to Moss
you shouldn't have?

23:25.004 --> 23:26.615
Don't. Charlotte.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.050
I didn't kill anybody.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.385
You know what? We're gonna
need a few moments, please.

23:30.409 --> 23:35.057
Who charges more, Dwight,
you or her?

23:35.081 --> 23:36.592
Yeah?

23:36.616 --> 23:38.293
Hey, you can take all the time
you need. She's staying.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.162
On what charges?

23:40.186 --> 23:43.713
No charges. Material witness.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.409
Hey... coffee?

23:54.433 --> 23:57.036
Cream, two sugars?

24:01.807 --> 24:03.752
I can't be bought, Gibbs.

24:03.776 --> 24:07.109
I'm sorry. Judge's orders.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.527
Charlotte's not your killer.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.162
How do you know that?

24:14.186 --> 24:15.731
I know people.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.466
That's what I get paid for.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.967
Were paid for.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.871
Look, I've been
with the violent ones.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.795
She's not one of them.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.647
So aren't you going to ask?

24:31.671 --> 24:34.049
How'd a nice girl like me,
blah, blah, blah?

24:34.073 --> 24:35.484
- No.
- No?

24:35.508 --> 24:37.152
No.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.488
- Oh, come on, you know you want to.
- No.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.223
I don't care.

24:41.247 --> 24:44.239
Oh, he doesn't care.

24:45.551 --> 24:49.398
Somebody approached me
when I was at Wellesley.

24:49.422 --> 24:52.467
I was an art history major.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.670
Big student loans.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.839
No family.

24:57.863 --> 25:00.559
And I was working three jobs.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.147
Then I found out
how much I could make

25:05.171 --> 25:07.707
in another line of work.

25:09.475 --> 25:11.386
And they say you
can't make money

25:11.410 --> 25:12.778
with a liberal arts degree.

25:15.047 --> 25:18.326
I didn't know you
had a sense of humor.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.162
Oh, there's a lot
you don't know about me, Holly.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.398
You just think you do.

25:23.422 --> 25:27.059
I know Charlotte's innocent.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.942
Yeah, Gibbs.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.078
Boss, just got another call
from McCadden.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.080
Norfolk PD found another body.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.347
Same MO, same murder weapon.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.582
Same killer.

25:40.606 --> 25:43.618
Yeah, but the time of death
was two hours ago,

25:43.642 --> 25:46.406
while Charlotte Cook
was in our custody.

25:50.082 --> 25:53.415
Well, you were right,
Holly Snow.

26:02.127 --> 26:03.905
Nice!

26:03.929 --> 26:07.976
All right, favorite film
finale set in a factory, Phil.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.978
Mm... Terminator.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.948
Evil Arnie gets crushed
by the industrial press.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.149
Yeah, yeah.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.384
I like Terminator 2,
where the T-1000

26:16.408 --> 26:18.019
falls into the vat
of molten steel

26:18.043 --> 26:19.220
and then heroic Arnie
follows suit.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.288
Might be better.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.856
Well, if it isn't T-Cad.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.625
- What?
- T-Cad.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.093
It's what I'm calling
you guys now.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.461
You know, the cute
couples contraction?

26:26.485 --> 26:28.129
TomKat, Bennifer,

26:28.153 --> 26:29.197
Brangelina?

26:29.221 --> 26:30.848
Yeah, we got it, McBitter.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.569
You two are wearing
the same suit, even.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.996
Nice.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.275
Building security
found the body.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.810
No blood.
Looks like he was dumped.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.278
Multiple stab wounds
to the back.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.380
We've definitely got
a fifth victim.

26:45.404 --> 26:49.651
Wounds on his arm, chest.
Guy wasn't easy to take out.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.619
- Put up a fight.
- Killer had to be strong.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.054
We're probably
looking for a male.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.380
Or Ziva.

26:55.481 --> 26:58.560
Your victim's got a rap sheet.

26:58.584 --> 27:00.061
Busted for solicitation.

27:00.085 --> 27:02.731
Another one of Charlotte's
clients.

27:02.755 --> 27:03.798
Call that into Gibbs.

27:03.822 --> 27:05.867
Come on, Phil.

27:05.891 --> 27:07.602
- Let's get something to eat.
- Yeah, sounds good.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.991
You ever see Diner?

27:14.500 --> 27:16.544
It's a nicer room this time.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.980
You recognize your mistakes,
Agent Gibbs?

27:19.004 --> 27:20.815
No mistake.

27:20.839 --> 27:23.051
Just being thorough.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.185
This won't take long.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.320
Well, it's going to take

27:25.344 --> 27:26.971
as long as I say
it's going to take.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.415
Another one of your
johns, Charlotte.

27:32.818 --> 27:33.828
This is ridiculous.

27:33.852 --> 27:35.430
She's innocent.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.731
You're her alibi.

27:36.755 --> 27:38.985
Five men are dead.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.270
The only thing they have
in common is you.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.506
You need to tell us
everything you can.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.674
Wait. She has no authority here.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.893
She's here to help your client.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.920
Somebody's following you.

27:58.944 --> 28:02.937
If you keep seeing clients,
he will keep killing.

28:05.717 --> 28:09.531
So you really got out, huh?

28:09.555 --> 28:12.534
Took a bunch of courage.

28:12.558 --> 28:14.116
I couldn't do it.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.740
Give us a name.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.231
Someone who's gotten physical.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.317
Honey, you can trust me.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.186
She is not giving you
the names of men

28:31.210 --> 28:32.420
that can testify against her.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.489
- Nice try, though.
- Am I talking to you?

28:34.513 --> 28:37.607
Your stupidity is gonna
get somebody else killed.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.800
Charlotte, this is about you.

28:45.824 --> 28:48.520
Do you think that
he's gonna stop with them?

28:50.129 --> 28:53.641
He gets mad at you,

28:53.665 --> 28:55.565
you'll end up the same way.

28:57.202 --> 29:00.381
Uh... Nicholas.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.117
I'm not sure what
his last name was.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.686
50's, bald.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.554
Said he worked for
the State Department.

29:06.578 --> 29:10.058
I met him right after
you got arrested.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.093
He plays rough.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.095
Crazy jealous.

29:14.119 --> 29:16.212
He wanted me to stop
seeing other men.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.467
Make them think
they're the only ones?

29:19.491 --> 29:22.370
Sometimes they believe it.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.385
Yeah.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.249
Nicholas... you know him?

29:34.273 --> 29:35.416
Yeah.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.985
But you'll never believe how.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.387
Okay, slow it down.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.556
I always remember
the clingy ones.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.893
Lots of questions.
Not enough personal space.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.861
There.

29:46.885 --> 29:48.062
That's him.

29:48.086 --> 29:49.164
Freeze it, McGee.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.231
All right, name tag.

29:50.255 --> 29:53.019
It's a lot easier than a BOLO.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.571
Did you get my Nutter Butters?

29:56.595 --> 29:58.506
Oh, hey, slim Tim.
Forgot about that.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.541
Sorry.

29:59.565 --> 30:00.708
I'll bet you did.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.377
You used to get
my Nutter Butters.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.012
You taking a little break,
are you, DiNozzo?

30:04.036 --> 30:06.181
Uh, just a little
low blood sugar.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.582
Just grabbing a snack, boss.
I'm back.

30:07.606 --> 30:08.907
Already got a hit on him, boss.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.087
Who's Nicholas Everett?

30:13.111 --> 30:14.756
That's what
you're gonna find out.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.324
And I want everything.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.825
Let's go, Holly.

30:17.849 --> 30:18.927
Where are we going?

30:18.951 --> 30:20.428
I'm taking you home.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.963
Oh! And tucking me in?

30:21.987 --> 30:23.852
Wow.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.770
Holly Snow in person.

30:28.794 --> 30:30.238
Best call girl movie ever?

30:30.262 --> 30:31.272
Klute.

30:31.296 --> 30:32.957
- Sutherland, nice.
- Mm-hmm.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.580
Leaving Las Vegas.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.582
So you heard about T-Cad?

30:40.606 --> 30:44.269
Tony's new bromance.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.322
Oh, honey, don't worry.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.224
It'll be over soon.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.659
I don't care when it's over.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.429
It can go forever,
as far as I'm concerned.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.998
Oh, somebody needs a hug.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.132
I need a lead.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.400
Oh, really?

30:59.424 --> 31:01.169
'Cause I found
our killer's blood.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.303
How's that for a case-cracker?

31:02.327 --> 31:04.105
Guess where?

31:04.129 --> 31:06.274
No, really.
Like, I want you to guess.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.276
- On the knife?
- No. Guess again.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.844
Abby...

31:09.868 --> 31:12.580
I found trace amounts inside

31:12.604 --> 31:14.515
the stab wounds
of our latest victim.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.617
You got a name?

31:15.641 --> 31:17.352
I ran the DNA
through the database.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.353
Nothing in the system.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.355
But... guess what McGee found?

31:20.379 --> 31:21.923
Abby, no more guessing.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.725
Nicholas Everett's
credit cards...

31:23.749 --> 31:25.093
two months ago he purchased

31:25.117 --> 31:27.729
a hunting knife called
a Sultan Slayer 150.

31:27.753 --> 31:28.753
Murder weapon.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.667
The bevel point
and serrated spine

31:32.691 --> 31:36.371
of the Sultan Slayer 150
matches the wound patterns

31:36.395 --> 31:37.672
of all five victims.

31:37.696 --> 31:39.040
How'd the killer's blood
get inside his victims?

31:39.064 --> 31:41.142
I've been dying for
you to ask me that.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.378
This knife lacks
a prominent hilt.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.513
So if it gets slick...
like say, I don't know,

31:45.537 --> 31:47.015
if you were stabbing someone...

31:47.039 --> 31:48.516
it's hard to grip.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.718
The killer's hand must
have slipped down the handle.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.220
Cut himself with his own knife.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.889
As he continued stabbing,
bled into the victim's wounds.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.293
Our killer is going
to have a slice on the heel

31:58.317 --> 32:00.328
- or the palm of his hand.
- That's good work.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.362
Wait.

32:01.386 --> 32:03.231
Could you give
McGee my hug today?

32:03.255 --> 32:04.984
Because he really needs one.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.853
I'm good, boss. Thanks.

32:17.402 --> 32:19.714
Hey, dug into Nicholas Everett.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.149
Okay, go.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.384
Multiple complaints
filed by family,

32:23.408 --> 32:26.421
neighbors and work associates
for volatile, erratic behavior,

32:26.445 --> 32:28.589
and he was also arrested
for domestic abuse.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.410
Pick him up.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.062
Probie does a lot for me.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.063
Really?

32:35.087 --> 32:36.698
Seems like such a geek.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.132
You deserve better.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.967
There is no better.

32:39.991 --> 32:42.470
I doubt that, compadre.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.973
Hey, now Ziva... I'd get that
cupcake a cookie anytime.

32:45.997 --> 32:47.809
Hey... Let's wait
for him in the lobby

32:47.833 --> 32:49.977
like Ness at the steps
in The Untouchables.

32:50.001 --> 32:51.279
It was a train station, Phil.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.780
Remember
The Battleship Potemkin?

32:52.804 --> 32:55.034
Whatever.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.041
Nicholas Everett?

33:01.580 --> 33:03.891
Hold it! Freeze!

33:03.915 --> 33:05.093
Back it up!

33:05.117 --> 33:06.260
What's the matter with you?

33:06.284 --> 33:07.895
Hands in the air. You got him?

33:07.919 --> 33:09.063
Yeah.

33:09.087 --> 33:10.431
What the hell is this?

33:10.455 --> 33:12.133
Dead johns, Nicky.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.134
I work here.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.760
People are gonna see this.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.240
What?

33:19.264 --> 33:20.856
Hands.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.278
Killer had to have
some kind of cut.

33:24.302 --> 33:26.793
Everett didn't do it.

33:34.379 --> 33:35.689
Okay. Thank you, Abby.

33:35.713 --> 33:37.424
Well...

33:37.448 --> 33:39.093
Nicholas Everett's
Sultan Slayer knife

33:39.117 --> 33:41.262
was as clean as his
injury-free hands.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.130
Well, his alibi checks out, too.

33:43.154 --> 33:45.232
Everett was in a court-ordered
anger management program

33:45.256 --> 33:46.634
when two of the murders
occurred.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.421
So, you've got nothing.

33:50.061 --> 33:52.606
Phil, I think it's more
like we've got nothing.

33:52.630 --> 33:53.974
Except five dead bodies,

33:53.998 --> 33:57.211
all killed by the same person,
with the same knife.

33:57.235 --> 34:00.047
Well, the only connection
between our five victims

34:00.071 --> 34:02.349
is our high-priced escort
Charlotte.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.452
No. No. Actually, there
is another connection.

34:05.476 --> 34:06.987
The person that introduced her

34:07.011 --> 34:08.621
to the clients...
Charlotte's old boss.

34:08.646 --> 34:10.391
Yeah. Where is Miss
Holly Golightly, anyway?

34:10.415 --> 34:11.492
That's a good question.

34:11.516 --> 34:12.560
She's not home.

34:12.583 --> 34:13.694
She's not answering
her cell phone.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.228
Couldn't have gone far.

34:15.253 --> 34:16.297
Track her ankle monitor.

34:16.321 --> 34:17.321
Tracking.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.366
Got her signal.

34:19.389 --> 34:20.668
Yep, she's moving, boss.

34:20.692 --> 34:21.716
She's breaking parole.

34:22.627 --> 34:23.737
McGee, MTAC, now.

34:23.761 --> 34:24.761
Got it, boss.

34:26.364 --> 34:27.842
We'll take it from here, Phil.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.577
I think you can hit the road.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.501
You sure?

34:32.871 --> 34:34.405
Very.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.762
Where is she going, Gibbs?

34:48.786 --> 34:50.130
I have no idea.

34:50.154 --> 34:51.866
Get one... she's
your responsibility.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.833
I didn't chain her
to my leg, Leon.

34:53.858 --> 34:54.859
Why not?

34:56.027 --> 34:58.154
Other men have paid
money to do it.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.611
I want a BOLO out on her car.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.579
Already done. GPS signal

35:05.603 --> 35:07.264
shows her heading
towards Alexandria.

35:10.308 --> 35:13.587
Ooh. Uh, Holly's ankle monitor
just went offline.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.588
Maybe her battery's dead?

35:14.612 --> 35:16.190
Or she disabled it.

35:16.214 --> 35:17.424
She's got no reason to.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.726
That we know of.

35:18.750 --> 35:19.727
Check her cell, McGee.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.896
Well, it's turned off.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.632
But I bet I can retrieve
her most recent text messages

35:24.656 --> 35:26.734
from the carrier.
Okay, last message

35:26.758 --> 35:28.869
Holly received was
from Charlotte Cook

35:28.893 --> 35:30.758
- less than an hour ago.
- Put it up.

35:32.997 --> 35:34.508
Oh, hell. She went to help her.

35:34.532 --> 35:35.910
You got Charlotte's cell?

35:35.934 --> 35:37.401
Tracking it.

35:38.670 --> 35:39.914
Uh, no signal.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.582
Did get a hit on her name,
though.

35:41.606 --> 35:44.151
Charlotte Cook's been admitted
to a DC emergency room.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.520
Here name was registered
in the DVP alert system.

35:46.544 --> 35:48.739
Domestic Violence Protocol.

35:51.516 --> 35:54.795
Dr. John
Gardner to Radiology, please.

35:54.819 --> 35:58.050
Dr. John Gardner to Radiology.

36:00.124 --> 36:02.183
Charlotte...

36:03.895 --> 36:06.030
We need to talk.

36:14.372 --> 36:16.116
Who did this to you?

36:16.140 --> 36:19.486
I try to be careful.

36:19.510 --> 36:23.190
All these years,
I've been lucky.

36:23.214 --> 36:26.160
I guess I just thought
if anything happened, it...

36:26.184 --> 36:29.096
it would be one of them.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.799
But I don't want to make
him angrier, becau...

36:31.823 --> 36:34.053
Who did this?

36:37.829 --> 36:40.808
Other people are going to die.

36:40.832 --> 36:43.960
And then he's going
to turn on you.

36:45.003 --> 36:47.233
My boyfriend.

36:49.173 --> 36:50.284
He just gets so jealous.

36:50.308 --> 36:52.720
I tried to confront him
about the killings.

36:52.744 --> 36:53.954
Who... Who is your boyfriend?

36:53.978 --> 36:56.190
My lawyer.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.792
DiNozzo, put out a BOLO
on Dwight Kasdan.

36:58.816 --> 37:00.027
He's a Georgetown lawyer.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.096
And get additional security
up here.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.198
On it, boss.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.866
Where is Holly Snow?

37:05.890 --> 37:07.534
I don't know.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.770
You sent her a text.

37:09.794 --> 37:11.372
No, I didn't.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.107
Dwight took my phone,

37:13.131 --> 37:15.943
and told me if I...
if I talked to anybody,

37:15.967 --> 37:17.845
- he'd kill me.
- Where is he?

37:17.869 --> 37:19.980
I don't know.

37:20.004 --> 37:22.649
Metro PD's sending, uh, units
to his house and office,

37:22.673 --> 37:24.651
and McGee's got
a BOLO out on his car.

37:24.675 --> 37:27.588
McGee, cell phone records
for Dwight Kasdan.

37:27.612 --> 37:28.889
Yep. Already pulled 'em, boss.

37:28.913 --> 37:29.913
Go. Track him.

37:32.950 --> 37:35.496
He's currently
at an office complex...

37:35.520 --> 37:36.953
in Alexandria.

37:37.955 --> 37:39.066
It's a foreclosure.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.035
Kasdan reps the former owner.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.369
You stay with her.

37:42.393 --> 37:44.838
Anyone tries to get in here,
you shoot 'em.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.464
Happy to.

37:49.967 --> 37:51.992
You don't have to do this.

37:53.571 --> 37:57.251
Well, if she's not going
to stop seeing other men, Holly,

37:57.275 --> 37:59.266
I'm gonna make sure
they can't see her.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.690
You knew what she did
for a living.

38:03.714 --> 38:06.226
Did for you, Holly.

38:06.250 --> 38:08.896
I mean, you're the one
that got her into this.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.264
It's your fault.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.119
Now I'm gonna get her out.

38:13.424 --> 38:16.257
So, what, are you gonna stab me
in the back, too?

38:17.462 --> 38:19.473
What's the matter, Dwight?

38:19.497 --> 38:21.666
Afraid to look a
woman in the eye?

38:50.828 --> 38:52.396
It's okay.

39:06.077 --> 39:07.087
DiNozzo.

39:07.111 --> 39:08.322
Hey, Tony, it's me.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.380
Oh, hey, there, McCadden.

39:10.615 --> 39:12.659
Oh, really? Was that tonight?

39:12.683 --> 39:13.827
Yeah, it slipped my mind.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.295
I got tons to do, you know?

39:15.319 --> 39:17.197
Us NCIS geeks, uh,

39:17.221 --> 39:19.299
just closing out the case.

39:19.323 --> 39:20.534
- Maybe next time.
- No, I don't think

39:20.558 --> 39:22.958
there's gonna be
a next time, Phil.

39:25.763 --> 39:27.424
That was McCadden?

39:28.566 --> 39:29.999
Did you dump him, Tony?

39:31.002 --> 39:32.813
Has your man-mance
come to an end?

39:32.837 --> 39:34.114
I never had a man-mance.

39:34.138 --> 39:35.473
You had a fling.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.786
Guys don't have flings.
We hang out.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.175
Things were hanging out?

39:42.246 --> 39:43.508
That is disgusting.

39:46.684 --> 39:47.895
Hey.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.546
Cookie, McG?

39:50.721 --> 39:52.299
Nutter Butter.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.600
That was very nice.

39:53.624 --> 39:54.801
A peace offering.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.816
Feel guilty, don't you?

39:58.262 --> 39:59.524
Well, you should.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.042
I won't apologize.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.467
I don't expect you to.

40:05.269 --> 40:08.182
You're doing that thing again.
You're huffing on your coffee.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.883
I'm just sipping from the cup.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.875
- You're annoying.
- You're juvenile.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.375
Why do I even try?

40:26.824 --> 40:30.337
Okay, this has got to be
the best steak I've ever had.

40:30.361 --> 40:32.706
Please tell me.
What is your secret?

40:32.730 --> 40:34.332
It's all about the touch.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.767
You know, when it's ready...

40:39.804 --> 40:42.073
I pour a little beer on it.

40:43.341 --> 40:44.976
Waste of beer.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.792
Well...

40:51.816 --> 40:54.046
thank you
for a wonderful evening.

40:56.053 --> 40:58.165
And for delivering
on my little, um,

40:58.189 --> 41:00.180
deal-breaker.

41:01.859 --> 41:03.261
Really? It's that special?

41:05.263 --> 41:07.424
All I wanted was dinner
without expectations.

41:08.599 --> 41:10.590
With a friend.

41:11.636 --> 41:14.105
We're friends?

41:16.574 --> 41:17.905
Excuse me.

41:21.178 --> 41:23.624
Hello?

41:23.648 --> 41:26.059
Hi.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.294
Tonight.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.309
What time?

41:31.822 --> 41:33.991
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.903
Me, too.

41:36.927 --> 41:39.259
All right, bye-bye.

41:44.168 --> 41:47.180
Oh... I can explain.

41:47.204 --> 41:50.083
No. You don't have to.

41:50.107 --> 41:53.086
Uh, no, I know what you must be
thinking.

41:53.110 --> 41:55.455
Oh, I... I, um...

41:55.479 --> 41:57.640
