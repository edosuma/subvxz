All the signs were there.
I am never wrong about women.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.752
Except for my two ex‐wives.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.795
Am I always wrong
about women?

Wait. Are ‐‐ are you just gonna
go without saying goodbye?

Hey, JJ.
Thanks for coming tonight.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.392
You know, I kind of
hate you right now.

I guess I'm not
in JJ shape.

Darling,
you know I'm right.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.183
You can't get in trouble
for this nonsense.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.811
Huge mistake.
I can't watch you do it.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.521
It should be my choice.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.272
You're right ‐‐
I did tell you everything.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.565
I trusted you.

One last time.

Dr. Miller, before you pass
judgment on my son,

20:11.711 --> 20:14.296
there is something you need
to know about this picture.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.798
Do you want to tell her?

Ray, you will be suspended
for a week,

20:39.280 --> 20:41.991
and I'll compose a letter
to every Lafayette family

20:41.991 --> 20:43.701
detailing the consequences,

20:43.701 --> 20:46.245
so they know that <i>this</i>
will not be tolerated.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.205
That is great!
