WEBVTT

00:50.635 --> 00:51.886
Bastard.

00:55.974 --> 00:59.978
- Let's make a bet. I'm for the boss.
- I'm betting on the boss, too.

01:00.061 --> 01:02.731
This one is going to be easy.
They always let the boss win.

01:02.814 --> 01:06.484
That's true, but if someone's going
to beat him, it's this guy.

01:13.074 --> 01:16.077
<i>Tell me something. Are you a pussy?</i>

01:23.251 --> 01:24.335
Son of a bitch.

01:34.179 --> 01:36.431
- What's going on?
- You're a little slow, son.

01:38.433 --> 01:41.978
Careful, son, careful!
Keep looking forward, son!

01:51.279 --> 01:52.947
Oh, shit!

01:53.698 --> 01:56.785
All right, boys,
start getting that money out.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.046
...eighty. I'm missing 20.

02:08.129 --> 02:10.131
Oh, it looks like you won some money, eh?

02:10.215 --> 02:12.300
Of course, we're enjoying ourselves, boss.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.676
Very good, son.

02:14.344 --> 02:18.389
- Very good.
- What? Did he get pissed?

02:18.515 --> 02:19.808
Hey.

02:21.851 --> 02:23.686
Do you know why you won?

02:25.480 --> 02:30.318
That little trick. The same one, right?

02:30.401 --> 02:33.321
Don't be an idiot.
You know why you lost, Pablo?

02:33.404 --> 02:34.489
Why?

02:34.572 --> 02:39.077
Because you're a very smart guy,
but you're too stubborn. You understand?

02:39.202 --> 02:43.498
What I understand is I don't like to lose.
Especially because of tricks.

02:43.581 --> 02:46.918
- Someone had to teach you how to lose.
- Yeah, why?

02:48.753 --> 02:51.256
- Very well, you son of a bitch.
- Boss?

02:52.423 --> 02:55.593
- A photo?
- Sure, but not with that pansy.

02:55.718 --> 03:00.181
No. You go over there.
Over there, motherfucker.

03:00.265 --> 03:01.933
Cousin.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.602
It's because he doesn't know
how to lose, but that's fine.

03:05.103 --> 03:07.522
- Where are we headed, guys?
- To the whores!

03:16.114 --> 03:18.908
Look how they left this place.

03:22.787 --> 03:27.584
We found both the guards.
Stuffed into a trunk, burned alive.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.128
Did anybody see anything?

03:31.379 --> 03:35.633
We're sending spotters out, but...
they either come back with nothing or--

03:35.758 --> 03:38.386
- Or what?
- Or they don't come back.

03:43.933 --> 03:47.437
That bitch Judy Moncada did this.

03:48.229 --> 03:52.066
But she couldn't do this alone.
No fucking way.

03:52.150 --> 03:54.485
The guys that came at me
had high-end weapons.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.237
Big ones.

03:58.114 --> 03:59.282
Gringo shit.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.834
The Cali cartel.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.671
I fucking know it.

04:15.465 --> 04:18.176
Those sons of bitches will regret it.

04:18.259 --> 04:23.431
I will personally burn that fucking city
to the ground.

04:23.514 --> 04:24.849
We don't know that Pablo.

04:24.933 --> 04:29.687
Until we know who did it, we can't attack
the Cali cartel. It would be a mistake.

04:39.030 --> 04:43.201
Get whoever we can out on the street.
Give them cash.

04:43.284 --> 04:47.205
And if anyone needs more persuasion,
motivate them.

04:47.330 --> 04:53.878
Put the word out. We're going to kill
all the bastards who did this.

04:54.003 --> 04:56.464
I know I hit one of them.

04:56.547 --> 05:00.009
Let's hope he's still breathing.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.553
Because then...

05:05.056 --> 05:11.354
we can find out who that son of a bitch
is working for.

07:28.658 --> 07:32.620
PABLO MERRY CHRISTMAS
LOS PEPES

07:32.703 --> 07:36.290
HAPPY HOLIDAYS

07:39.043 --> 07:40.378
Good day.

07:40.461 --> 07:45.967
In a letter sent to the media, a group
that identifies itself as "Los Pepes,"

07:46.050 --> 07:49.637
an acronym for
"People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar."

07:49.720 --> 07:52.557
<i>...or "People Persecuted
by Pablo Escobar,"</i>

07:52.640 --> 07:57.311
<i>the vigilantes waging war on those
associated with the notorious drug lord.</i>

07:57.395 --> 08:03.568
Mr. President, the media is asking
for a comment on Los Pepes.

08:03.693 --> 08:06.571
It's only a matter of time
before it's made public.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.489
Acknowledgement isn't the same
as condemning.

08:08.573 --> 08:13.995
Sooner or later, you'll have to make
an official public statement.

08:14.078 --> 08:16.998
They're doing God's work
as far as I'm concerned.

08:17.081 --> 08:22.712
- That can't be our official position.
- It can be our official position...

08:24.922 --> 08:26.007
Gentlemen!

08:28.593 --> 08:32.763
Los Pepes is a vigilante death squad.

08:32.889 --> 08:35.766
We'll take care of them
when the time comes.

08:36.851 --> 08:40.104
But for now, let's focus
on our own efforts to catch Escobar.

08:41.063 --> 08:44.358
I believe that's proven
a big enough job for all of us.

08:44.442 --> 08:49.280
Our communications department has picked
up conversations in the Manrique district

08:49.405 --> 08:54.869
between Jairo, who is one of Escobar's
<i>sicarios,</i> and his mother, who is ill.

08:54.952 --> 08:58.789
We know Jairo is her only child
and likely to visit her.

08:59.582 --> 09:03.628
We'll continue to monitor the frequencies
for further information.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.129
One more thing.

09:05.213 --> 09:08.716
I don't have to tell you that there's
another group now operating in Medellín,

09:08.799 --> 09:11.719
combating Escobar: Los Pepes.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.304
Let me be very clear.

09:15.056 --> 09:21.812
There must and will be a clear line
between them and us.

09:21.938 --> 09:23.731
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.483
Dismissed, thank you.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.198
CNP's been busy with wiretaps.

10:14.323 --> 10:18.369
They picked up chatter
from Jairo's mom here... and here.

10:21.163 --> 10:25.293
Search Bloc won't be able to move until
they get corroboration he's in the area.

10:25.376 --> 10:27.461
Which could take days.

10:27.545 --> 10:31.882
Even longer... for them to find the house.

10:32.842 --> 10:38.139
I think... Jairo is planning a homecoming.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.308
Maybe even today.

10:45.187 --> 10:48.065
I'll see what I can find out
on the streets.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.575
- Hello?
<i>- Listen up, Carlos.</i>

10:57.658 --> 11:00.828
I have information that Jairo
is going to his mother's.

11:20.890 --> 11:23.434
- National Police, can you open up?
- What do you need?

11:23.517 --> 11:25.061
Open up. Hurry. Hurry.

11:41.452 --> 11:43.292
Don't make me kill you
in front of your mother.

11:43.371 --> 11:44.372
Don't touch her!

11:44.455 --> 11:46.749
Relax, mother, relax.

11:50.294 --> 11:53.214
Ma'am, if you don't cooperate,
we won't be able to find your son.

11:53.297 --> 11:57.134
But I don't know where he is.
I didn't notice anything.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.553
Do you have enemies here
in the neighborhood?

11:59.637 --> 12:02.556
I don't know.
It was my fault that he was here.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.058
He came to see his mother...

13:00.865 --> 13:04.326
IN DEFENSE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE

13:10.833 --> 13:13.210
- What did you ask Santa for?
- A game.

13:13.294 --> 13:15.546
- Which one?
- The Joker game.

13:15.671 --> 13:17.631
You think he'll bring it to you?

13:17.715 --> 13:18.966
Dad?

13:19.049 --> 13:22.052
Santa is going to bring me
the Joker game, right?

13:24.013 --> 13:26.724
Dad?

13:26.807 --> 13:28.476
Pablo, my love?

13:30.060 --> 13:33.147
Of course, Santa will bring you
everything you want, like always.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.232
Christmas without Christ.

13:42.490 --> 13:45.576
I'm planning on going to
the advent service tomorrow with the kids.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.912
What? No.
No one should leave this house.

13:48.037 --> 13:50.498
I'm sure the kids would love
to see the lights.

13:50.581 --> 13:52.750
The children are staying here
and so are you.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.085
Remember the first time
you saw the fireworks?

13:55.169 --> 13:58.756
My love, can you tell your mother
she can't take the children to Medellín?

13:58.839 --> 14:01.091
Mama, it's best for us to stay here.

14:01.217 --> 14:03.260
It's been a month
since I've gone to church.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.347
I'm sure that God
can hear your prayers from here.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.556
Don Pablo.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.859
Boss, they killed three more of our men.

14:18.943 --> 14:21.737
They found Jairo dead next to the river.

14:24.365 --> 14:27.243
Look, it's the Baccarat Crystal.

14:28.202 --> 14:29.286
Thank you.

14:29.411 --> 14:33.457
- That's also Baccarat Crystal.
- Feel the weight. Look...

14:34.291 --> 14:38.379
You can feel it's Baccarat.
This is from the Lloredas, right?

14:38.462 --> 14:39.880
How's it going, my love?

14:39.964 --> 14:42.800
My love, look at what
the Lloredas brought.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.385
Look, there's two.

14:45.261 --> 14:48.138
The Lloredas always treat us well...

14:49.765 --> 14:52.977
NEW DEATH SQUAD IN MEDELLIN
"LOS PEPES"

14:54.270 --> 14:59.900
As gratifying as these displays may feel,
I'm not comfortable with these signs.

14:59.984 --> 15:03.320
They invite too much attention
and will lead to questions.

15:03.445 --> 15:08.075
Our objective is to eliminate Escobar
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.660
Without a doubt.

15:17.585 --> 15:20.921
No more proclamations or manifestos
or letters to the media.

15:21.005 --> 15:23.173
What about Miami?

15:25.342 --> 15:27.595
We buy time.

15:27.678 --> 15:30.347
Let him think he still has control.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.975
Until the moment we take it from him.

15:39.690 --> 15:42.526
- New intel from the embassy.
- Thank you.

16:19.063 --> 16:22.316
<i>- What do you have for me, Peña?</i>
- I got something new.

16:23.067 --> 16:26.904
<i>- Blackie.</i>
- I like the way this is going, Javier.

16:26.987 --> 16:30.824
He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.

16:30.908 --> 16:34.662
It'll take a while.
Blackie's going to show.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.413
<i>It's done.</i>

17:38.058 --> 17:40.894
Almighty Holy Child of Atocha.
Carmelita, help me please.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.479
Don't fight with me anymore.

17:42.604 --> 17:46.066
I'm going to tell you two things:
First, relax.

17:46.150 --> 17:48.068
That's harmful for you and the baby.

17:48.152 --> 17:51.488
Second, for the love of God,
take the money.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.906
I'll find more later.

17:52.990 --> 17:56.243
It's not for you or me, it's for the baby,
please understand.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.246
Try to understand me.
I don't want your money.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.665
I want you to be with me
and the baby, that's it.

18:01.749 --> 18:05.586
Stop being stupid, girl.
We need that money.

18:05.669 --> 18:08.229
- Listen to your dad.
- I don't know what's wrong with this girl.

18:08.297 --> 18:10.132
She's stubborn.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.209
Post three is in position.

18:45.334 --> 18:48.796
<i>Yes, sir, we'll be there in five minutes.</i>

19:00.057 --> 19:01.058
<i>Wait, Javier.</i>

19:14.404 --> 19:18.575
Talk to me. We're just getting here.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.327
Copy that, we're leaving now.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.746
It was Berna.
The streets are full of Search Bloc.

19:22.871 --> 19:26.375
All right, boys, the hunt is over for now.
Let's get out of here.

19:32.381 --> 19:34.174
- What's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

19:34.258 --> 19:37.928
We're conducting a police operation.
All good?

19:39.763 --> 19:41.014
Let him through.

19:44.601 --> 19:49.940
Keep calm, guys.
Hide your weapons while we handle this.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.692
Let him through.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.911
Good evening, what can I do for you?

20:03.537 --> 20:07.958
Good afternoon, gentleman.
I need to see some form of ID, please.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.793
Of course, with pleasure.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.464
How's this for an ID?

20:22.973 --> 20:27.060
Get out of the car and put your hands
where I can see them.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.104
Quickly.

20:31.565 --> 20:32.733
Boy, come over here.

20:32.816 --> 20:37.404
- Colonel. Situation at checkpoint 20.
- What's going on?

20:37.487 --> 20:39.687
- Armed men attempting to pass through.
- Checkpoint 20?

20:39.740 --> 20:40.908
That's correct, sir.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.746
- All units move to position 20.
- Understood.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.998
All units to position 20.

20:56.924 --> 20:59.927
My love, you have to take the money.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.846
Blackie! Blackie. The cops are here.

21:02.930 --> 21:05.974
Take care of the baby!
Take care, Carmelita!

21:06.850 --> 21:11.480
We're both on the same team here.
What's the problem?

21:12.356 --> 21:16.360
Stay where you are!
Hands where I can see them.

21:19.196 --> 21:21.281
Relax, relax.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.534
Want to see my ID?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.537
Take it out slowly.

21:39.508 --> 21:42.636
You point a gun at me, motherfucker?

21:42.719 --> 21:44.721
Do me a favor.

21:44.805 --> 21:48.558
Move those cars because
we're not playing Cops and Robbers here.

21:54.189 --> 21:57.567
Relax!

21:57.651 --> 21:59.403
Disarm!

22:00.028 --> 22:02.072
- No, you disarm.
- Sir.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.324
Lower your firearm.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.745
Easy!

22:08.870 --> 22:11.540
Okay, tough guys. Bravo!

22:12.541 --> 22:13.541
Bravo!

22:14.418 --> 22:18.171
Bravo, yes, we know it.
We all want Escobar.

22:18.255 --> 22:20.257
But let us do the fucking job.

22:22.092 --> 22:25.262
What? You want to kill each other
at a checkpoint?

22:27.264 --> 22:28.932
Lower your weapon. Lower it.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.269
Lower it.

22:39.443 --> 22:42.779
Okay. These dreamers
think they're helping.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.283
- Are you okay? Yeah? Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

22:46.408 --> 22:50.120
Okay. Let's go home alive.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.039
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.457
- Let them pass.
- Okay.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.545
Well then, thank you.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.904
- What happened? Everything okay? Yes?
- Yes, sir.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.114
Miss, we need your cooperation.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.242
Tell us where Blackie is.
Where do we find him?

23:29.326 --> 23:30.994
I told you. I haven't seen him.

23:31.119 --> 23:33.330
Don't be afraid. We don't want you.

23:33.413 --> 23:36.166
We want your boyfriend, Blackie.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.836
Sir, I told you,
I don't know where he's at.

23:39.961 --> 23:42.422
That bastard has not come around
in a long time.

23:42.506 --> 23:45.926
If you want, let's go to the station.
But I told you, I don't know where he is.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.677
So please leave my house.

23:48.303 --> 23:50.931
They were eight, maybe ten.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.352
How did they take your firearm?

23:58.855 --> 24:02.526
I don't know, he just took it. Sorry.

24:04.653 --> 24:09.199
Next time, might as well
put the gun to your own head.

24:09.324 --> 24:10.534
It's easier.

25:28.945 --> 25:31.615
Mr. President, these men, the Castaños,

25:31.740 --> 25:35.035
I've seen their tactics firsthand
in the jungle against the FARC.

25:35.118 --> 25:40.040
<i>Their method of war is murder.
I think this is only the beginning.</i>

25:40.123 --> 25:42.709
<i>And it will get even worse.</i>

25:42.792 --> 25:45.462
<i>Colonel, I understand your concern.</i>

25:45.545 --> 25:49.132
It's strange. They usually operate
against the guerrillas

25:49.257 --> 25:52.802
but now they're operating
against the narcos.

25:52.886 --> 25:56.389
Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating
the best course of action

25:56.473 --> 25:58.141
with regard to Los Pepes.

25:58.225 --> 26:04.564
Sir, I'd like your permission
to engage them.

26:04.648 --> 26:09.903
No. The greatest service we can do
for this nation is capture Escobar.

26:09.986 --> 26:12.322
That's what we must focus on, Colonel.

26:12.447 --> 26:14.491
<i>It's our priority.</i>

26:14.574 --> 26:18.078
I understand. Thank you, sir.

26:47.816 --> 26:50.026
Let's take a look at this injury.

26:55.282 --> 26:56.658
Very good.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.961
This is going to hurt.
Tell me who you work for.

27:08.878 --> 27:11.006
The Castaños.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.052
The Castaños.

27:18.054 --> 27:21.725
What could have brought them
out of the jungle?

27:25.061 --> 27:26.896
I say it was money.

27:27.897 --> 27:31.192
More money than Judy Moncada can find.

27:35.989 --> 27:38.992
Now is not the time
to take on more problems, brother.

27:43.246 --> 27:46.166
The Cali cartel thinks
they're immune to attack.

27:46.249 --> 27:48.585
This can't go unanswered.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.087
Go.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.777
Carlos, you scared me.

28:27.290 --> 28:30.543
Tata, you have to do it now.
Pablo's gone mad.

28:30.627 --> 28:33.463
With everything he's planning,
there will be consequences.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.632
You and the kids
need to separate from him.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.467
No, Carlos.

28:40.970 --> 28:43.139
Tata, my God, listen to me.

28:43.264 --> 28:46.142
There's a fearlessness to Los Pepes
that I've never seen.

28:46.226 --> 28:49.229
The public declarations,
the open displays.

28:49.312 --> 28:51.815
They won't stop until he's dead.

28:51.898 --> 28:55.777
I know that, Carlos.
I've known for a long time now.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.988
You know what's the only thought
on my mind?

28:59.948 --> 29:01.658
That this is the last time...

29:02.450 --> 29:05.745
the last time
I'll look at my husband's face.

29:05.829 --> 29:09.082
The last time
I'll feel his arms around me.

29:09.165 --> 29:12.502
The last time I'll see him play
with our children.

29:12.585 --> 29:16.089
I automatically push that idea
out of my mind.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.924
And now?

29:21.344 --> 29:24.431
Now I know, Carlos, that wherever I go...

29:25.348 --> 29:27.767
I'll always be Pablo Escobar's wife.

29:27.851 --> 29:31.771
My children will always
be Pablo Escobar's children.

29:32.439 --> 29:34.941
Even if we lived in exile with him.

29:36.651 --> 29:38.194
But without him?

29:40.530 --> 29:41.698
No.

29:44.868 --> 29:47.370
Okay.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.122
Let's do something.

29:49.205 --> 29:53.293
If we talk to him,
maybe he'll reconsider leaving with us.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.797
I've had a good life.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.968
Did you ever imagine we'd have all this?

30:16.316 --> 30:23.323
When my niece was growing up,
she didn't think this day would come.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.242
She was so skinny.

30:26.326 --> 30:29.829
- She wore glasses and had braces.
- Yes.

30:29.913 --> 30:34.042
When she was 12,
she thought her life was over.

30:35.043 --> 30:38.505
I told her to wait and be patient.

30:38.588 --> 30:43.092
Someday her beauty on the outside
would match her beauty within.

30:43.218 --> 30:46.763
You have never looked more beautiful
than you do tonight.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.099
Cheers to the family.

30:50.767 --> 30:54.103
To Marta and Diego! Cheers!

31:55.665 --> 31:56.833
Wait!

31:57.625 --> 31:59.627
Wait!

32:16.853 --> 32:21.649
Ma! Papa! Papa!

32:23.860 --> 32:26.029
- I'm here, my love.
- Mom!

32:39.834 --> 32:41.210
That man...

32:44.547 --> 32:47.842
has no decency.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.850
To attack my family like this...

32:58.186 --> 33:00.229
my daughter...

33:01.189 --> 33:03.524
on the night of her wedding...

33:06.361 --> 33:08.863
Only a madman would do that.

33:11.240 --> 33:15.244
A crazed animal, dangerous.

33:19.332 --> 33:20.500
I want him dead.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.544
Not next year. Right now.

33:24.504 --> 33:26.255
Kill all of them.

33:26.339 --> 33:30.927
I don't just want you to kill his lawyers,
accountants and bankers...

33:31.052 --> 33:34.055
I want you to kill his secretaries...

33:35.348 --> 33:39.936
anyone who lifted a finger
to help that man.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.896
I want to see them dead.

33:42.605 --> 33:47.276
Anyone who has ever licked a postage stamp
and put it on an envelope in his name,

33:47.360 --> 33:49.445
I want to see them dead.

33:49.570 --> 33:55.451
And then I want you to find anyone who
ever shook his hand and kill them too!

33:58.579 --> 34:00.581
That son of a bitch.

34:04.460 --> 34:08.631
From this night, we'll show no mercy.

34:19.726 --> 34:21.060
<i>Gilberto?</i>

34:21.144 --> 34:24.480
Gilberto, Miguel and Pacho survived, boss.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.899
That'll be all, Quica.

34:26.983 --> 34:28.276
Thank you, boss.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.244
Pablo?

34:40.830 --> 34:42.832
I'm worried about Tata.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.586
I think you should let her travel.
She'll be safer.

34:46.669 --> 34:49.797
What you're doing will have consequences.

34:51.007 --> 34:53.509
That's why they're here. Right?

34:54.510 --> 34:56.929
That's why they're here with me,
to be safe.

34:57.013 --> 34:59.849
- Cali is going to want payback for--
- I know...

35:00.683 --> 35:03.352
who my enemies are, Carlos.

35:05.188 --> 35:07.273
And I can fight them all.

35:07.356 --> 35:08.608
I know that.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.861
But if Tata and the children
are out of the country,

35:11.986 --> 35:14.030
you'd be free to wage this war
with no holds barred.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.994
Let me ask you something.

35:30.630 --> 35:32.381
Why are you here?

35:32.465 --> 35:33.841
For Tata.

35:35.551 --> 35:36.636
Right?

35:39.347 --> 35:41.349
To make her happier.

35:42.225 --> 35:47.563
To help her be more comfortable
with the life we're being forced to lead.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.401
Have you done that?

35:53.861 --> 35:57.156
Pablo, my sister is terrified.
And you can't see that--

35:57.240 --> 36:03.412
Your sister is a lot tougher
than you think.

36:05.039 --> 36:09.001
My wife... and my children...

36:09.710 --> 36:11.712
stay with me.

36:29.438 --> 36:30.439
Hello.

37:36.923 --> 37:38.007
Ma'am?

37:39.175 --> 37:41.010
Take me to Mass.

37:41.844 --> 37:45.598
- But the boss said we couldn't.
- Pablo worries too much.

37:45.681 --> 37:47.475
Besides, you work for me.

37:51.938 --> 37:58.027
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

37:58.110 --> 38:04.867
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.

38:04.992 --> 38:10.456
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

38:10.539 --> 38:14.502
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

38:36.190 --> 38:42.655
It's shameful for the country to stand by
while a group of mercenaries

38:42.738 --> 38:46.909
distributes its version
of perverse justice.

38:47.910 --> 38:50.079
It makes all of us look bad.

38:50.204 --> 38:54.333
- Including the president.
- Especially the president.

38:54.417 --> 38:58.754
If he continues to allow Los Pepes
to do the dirty work,

38:58.838 --> 39:00.423
which is his responsibility...

39:02.925 --> 39:06.595
Colombia will never forgive him.

39:22.278 --> 39:25.239
MERRY CHRISTMAS

43:23.477 --> 43:24.520
Where were you?

43:25.187 --> 43:27.856
- I went to church.
- I told you it wasn't safe.

43:27.982 --> 43:31.360
And I told you that it would be fine.
And look, everything's fine.

43:31.443 --> 43:33.696
How could you put the children's lives
at risk?

43:33.779 --> 43:35.864
No one here is in danger.

43:35.948 --> 43:40.202
I'm surprised at you, Pablo.
This one has always been nervous, but you?

43:40.327 --> 43:41.954
Don't talk that way to my husband.

43:42.037 --> 43:47.626
I can talk to him however I want.
I don't know why everyone is--

43:56.468 --> 43:59.221
Take Tata and the kids!
You, cover my mother!

44:09.148 --> 44:12.901
Juan Pablo! Juan Pablo!
Put your coat on, quick! Put your coat on.

44:12.985 --> 44:15.571
Come here, Manuela. Let's go, Pablo!

44:15.654 --> 44:19.366
This way! Run!

44:20.075 --> 44:22.411
Run quickly!

44:24.330 --> 44:25.664
Pablo!

44:28.042 --> 44:30.502
Get out!

44:30.586 --> 44:32.421
Carlos, let's go!

44:33.422 --> 44:35.591
Run, Limón, run!

44:35.674 --> 44:37.676
Let's go! Outside!

44:37.760 --> 44:41.180
- Come on, Tata, come on.
- Get him in the car. Get him inside!

44:41.263 --> 44:44.767
- Quickly! Let's go!
- Quickly!

44:44.892 --> 44:46.185
Give me the girl.

44:46.268 --> 44:48.103
Get in, Tata, get in.

44:49.104 --> 44:51.190
Come on, brother. Go! Cover that side!

44:51.273 --> 44:52.441
Move!

45:56.797 --> 45:58.841
They're in the house!
Let's go! Let's go!

46:02.428 --> 46:04.346
- Calm down.
- Don't let her move.

46:05.347 --> 46:06.974
Come on, boss! Let's go.

46:10.644 --> 46:12.479
- No!
- Pablo!

46:13.605 --> 46:15.691
Come on!

46:16.692 --> 46:18.861
Boss, come on!

46:18.986 --> 46:21.029
Let's go, boss!

46:23.323 --> 46:24.450
Come on!

46:25.784 --> 46:27.286
Let's go!

47:30.682 --> 47:32.184
Los Pepes...

47:35.103 --> 47:37.773
the Cali cartel, Judy Moncada,

47:37.856 --> 47:41.693
the Castaños, the government, the gringos.

47:41.777 --> 47:44.530
Let the bastards come.

47:44.613 --> 47:48.951
We'll be ready for a war,
a fucking bloodbath.

47:49.076 --> 47:53.747
We will fight like we have never
fought before in our lives.

47:54.957 --> 47:56.291
Yes, boss.

47:56.792 --> 47:59.795
Go for food and you go for firewood.

48:02.297 --> 48:08.303
Whoever did this
will never get near us ever again.

48:12.724 --> 48:14.726
I promise you.

48:21.984 --> 48:26.446
Daddy, how will Santa
know how to find us?

48:37.332 --> 48:38.834
Santa...

48:41.670 --> 48:47.676
Santa will always find
your good and kind heart.

48:49.595 --> 48:52.514
Wherever you are in this world.

48:52.598 --> 48:57.936
Boss? The wood is all wet.
There's no way to light it up.

49:08.030 --> 49:11.199
Go to Envigado for food and wood.

49:11.283 --> 49:14.703
- Right away, boss.
- Be careful not to be seen.

49:14.786 --> 49:15.871
Got it.

49:20.709 --> 49:22.794
This is all I could find, boss.

49:23.879 --> 49:25.380
How do you open that shit?

49:25.505 --> 49:27.215
I'll go look, boss.

49:44.399 --> 49:45.734
This just came in.

49:51.031 --> 49:53.075
Shit's getting real, Peña.

50:47.963 --> 50:50.799
Mommy, I'm cold.

50:53.719 --> 50:55.220
She's freezing.

51:01.893 --> 51:03.228
Put this on.

51:38.138 --> 51:43.018
You and the children...
need to leave Colombia.

51:45.937 --> 51:51.693
When you're safe,
I'll be free to do what's best for us.

52:00.994 --> 52:02.954
It won't be long.

52:06.541 --> 52:09.211
Soon we'll be together again.

52:13.715 --> 52:15.217
Forever.
