challenge so far?

04:05.345 --> 04:06.778
[rozin] I would say right now
it's lead time.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.513
And it's really difficult to get
our foot in the door

04:08.515 --> 04:11.316
With even a single manufacturer.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.517
Sometimes even overseas--

04:12.519 --> 04:16.187
You've reached out to canadian
foam manufacturers,

04:16.256 --> 04:17.889
And they're not
getting back to you?

04:17.957 --> 04:21.360
Waiting a month to hear back,
it's really painful when you

04:21.428 --> 04:24.195
Have a lot of growth plans.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.563
Some of them have a really high
price.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.232
Some of them don't wanna work
with us because they can't

04:27.234 --> 04:28.433
Handle our volume.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.936
You drop the lead time,
give me your blue sky revenue.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.839

04:33.907 --> 04:37.309
Our ambitions far out--I mean,
exceed anything else,

important to make sure we can

04:40.146 --> 04:41.680
Get this to where
it deserves to be.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.750
Can you just tell us a little
bit about your backgrounds?

04:44.818 --> 04:47.852
Well, I got my degree in
psychology with a specialization

04:47.855 --> 04:49.187
In children and family.

04:49.255 --> 04:51.923
So were you the brainchild of
the product?

04:51.991 --> 04:52.957
-Yes.
-[manjit] okay.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.292
And then you brought your
brother along?

04:54.295 --> 04:55.594
He was hesitant.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.930
He's like, "who's gonna buy a
foam couch for their kids?"

04:58.999 --> 05:00.899
I'm like, "I'm telling you,
I want it.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.567
I desperately want it."

05:04.904 --> 05:07.639
I have eight years of
digital marketing

05:07.707 --> 05:09.241
And growth marketing expertise.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.676
I learned what hard work really
is at a young age.

05:11.745 --> 05:15.113
We moved to canada when we were
eight years old, and we--

05:15.181 --> 05:17.549
-From where?
-[rozin] I was 8, she was 12.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.284
-From iraq.
-Oh, okay.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.619
Yeah, we were technically
refugees as a consequence,

05:21.622 --> 05:23.021
And that's why we fled.

05:23.089 --> 05:26.491
When we grew up, we really
struggled from kind of a racial

05:26.559 --> 05:28.493
And cultural discrimination
perspective,

05:28.561 --> 05:31.296
And so that's why for us,
part of it is adversity

05:31.298 --> 05:33.832
But also understanding that
there is a give back.

05:33.900 --> 05:37.235
And so every pre-order,
we donate play couches...

05:37.303 --> 05:40.271
-Good for you.
-...To families in need.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.474

my pocket,

05:42.542 --> 05:44.275

the hockey bedspread.

down, all right,

over 30 fans per nhl team.

Payday lenders in canada are
charging 300% to 500%.

I don't know, I can't speak for
the other dragons,

19:05.778 --> 19:09.413
But I've had to think about
using payday loan organizations

19:09.481 --> 19:12.283
When I was, you know,
raising my family and had

19:12.351 --> 19:13.684
No money and was
desperate for cash.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.454
I was just a mom with kids
trying to survive.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.891
And, you know, like I think this
is really important.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.727
You know, it's a
completely--it's a completely

19:23.796 --> 19:25.462
Missed marketplace.

19:25.465 --> 19:29.400
We see huge opportunity here to
help the underbanked

19:29.468 --> 19:30.901
And underserved.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.870
How much interest rate do you
charge for the payday loan?

19:33.639 --> 19:35.273
So we don't charge anything for
this.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.341
This is a benefit just for
banking with us.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.276
We're not making--

19:38.344 --> 19:39.510
So then how do you make money?

19:39.578 --> 19:41.946
So we make money on the
interchange fees whenever people

19:41.948 --> 19:45.082
Make a purchase with our card.

19:45.084 --> 19:49.253
So whenever you use the pre-paid
card at any online store

19:49.321 --> 19:52.189
Or retail store, there's a 3%
fee that's being charged that

19:52.192 --> 19:54.458
The merchant is paying that the
consumer doesn't know about.

19:55.261 --> 19:58.495
The network provider gets 1.5%
and hutsy gets

19:58.498 --> 19:59.564
An additional 1.5%.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.232
So you're pre-revenue right now,
right?

20:01.300 --> 20:03.367
Yes, that's correct.

20:03.435 --> 20:07.037
So one of the challenges with
the interchange model as soon as

20:07.040 --> 20:10.641
You start running this, and I've
done it myself, is that you're

20:10.710 --> 20:13.844
Getting a percentage of sales,
and so you actually want to be

20:13.912 --> 20:19.283
Driving as much volume through
these cards as possible.

20:19.351 --> 20:22.620
Your target market is lower
income, and so it's really hard

20:22.688 --> 20:24.956
In these models to justify your
cost of acquisition.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.326
So we're currently going to be
paying $5 for our customer

20:29.395 --> 20:32.997
Acquisition, and we would
anticipate that the average

20:33.065 --> 20:35.299
Person would be spending $700 a
month.

20:35.367 --> 20:40.671
So on our basic card, we're
anticipating to make $57 a year

20:40.740 --> 20:42.640
On interchange per user.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.609
And we do have a premium card
which users are paying

20:45.678 --> 20:47.011
$10 a month.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.481
We've introduced multiple
revenue-generating products.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.416
We're not solely relying on the
interchange fee.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.285
We also have our premium models,
we also have loans,

20:54.353 --> 20:57.955
And we also have a credit
building program.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.958
For the credit building service,
we charge $10 a month,

21:01.026 --> 21:02.860
And on the loans, we're making
6% of the volume.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.698
If I asked for $200 two days
early, how much will it cost

21:07.700 --> 21:09.967
Hutsy to actually front me that
money?

21:11.670 --> 21:12.737
Because capital isn't free for
hutsy either.

21:13.839 --> 21:14.771
Yes, for sure, for sure.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.640
So assuming that we get this
round closed,

21:16.709 --> 21:17.975
We would be using that capital.

21:18.043 --> 21:21.378
And then we also reached out to
silicon valley bank in order

21:21.447 --> 21:24.114
To hopefully get a commercial
line of credit,

21:24.183 --> 21:26.116
So we could pull money for that.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.118
So since--

21:27.120 --> 21:28.152
[vincenzo] yeah, but that costs
something.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.253

will cost you money.

21:29.255 --> 21:29.553
[tefari] yeah, exactly,
that line of credit will

21:29.622 --> 21:30.854
Cost us money.

21:30.856 --> 21:31.422

becaue that bank will not give

woodstove and rocks to warm up

[trish] we've designed these hot
tubs and saunas for campers just

27:18.370 --> 27:22.072
Like us, but what we've learned
in the last 14 months of being

In business, there's a huge
sauna culture in canada.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.179

high that we spent about

27:29.247 --> 27:31.281

out of inventory.

27:38.223 --> 27:39.490
[wes] yeah.

27:39.492 --> 27:40.691
Well, we wanted a little more
comfort in the woods, I guess.

27:40.759 --> 27:41.591
[arlene] well, apparently.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.893
Stay home then!

27:42.895 --> 27:46.163

27:54.807 --> 27:56.006
[trish] yeah.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.174
And now I'm rich,

Business seems to be going well
because you are out of stock.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.924
-Yes.
-So let's talk about numbers.

28:13.992 --> 28:16.960
Last year, despite the fact that
we were out of stock,

28:17.028 --> 28:19.263
We did do $160,000 in sales.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.966
We anticipate this year
finishing off

28:23.034 --> 28:24.668
With about $500,000 in sales.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.204
And what's the price point for
them?

28:27.206 --> 28:31.108
[trish] the five-foot hot tub
package sells for $995.

28:31.176 --> 28:32.342
[manjit] okay.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.411
[trish] the sauna with the
stainless steel stove sells

28:34.480 --> 28:36.379
For $1,095.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.815
[vincenzo] out of the $160,000
of sales last year,

28:38.884 --> 28:40.450
What did you make as a profit?

28:40.453 --> 28:43.153
We operate out of our home.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.955
It's changed now a little bit
because now we're giving

28:44.957 --> 28:46.990
Ourselves salaries,
and we weren't initially...

28:47.058 --> 28:48.458
Right.

28:48.461 --> 28:51.895
[trish]...So our net margin
would probably be more around

28:51.963 --> 28:54.331
The 30% mark now.

28:54.399 --> 28:58.802
So you're telling me that on
$160,000, you would have netted,

28:58.870 --> 29:01.571
After your salaries, $32,000?

29:01.640 --> 29:05.142
So if I had to do a quick...

29:05.210 --> 29:13.116
We're about $5,000 a month in
just our overhead--oh, eight,

29:13.185 --> 29:22.726
Nine, ten--about $12,000 a month
in our overhead every month.

29:22.795 --> 29:25.462
So that means you made $16,000.

29:25.531 --> 29:26.730
It's a 10% margin.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.298
Yes, that would probably be more

35:43.041 --> 35:44.441
Herself thin.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.810
Hello, dragons.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.346
My name is amy rosen of rosen's
cinnamon buns.

35:49.881 --> 35:54.184
And I'm here to ask $100,000 for
20% of my delicious business.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.321
So our story begins five years
ago.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.523
I was at my parents' cottage for
christmas break,

36:00.592 --> 36:02.993
And then one morning I made
cinnamon buns,

36:03.061 --> 36:05.862
And for the first time all week,
everyone was silent.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.564
[laughs]

36:07.566 --> 36:09.232
[amy] "I should open up a
cinnamon bun bakery,"

36:09.300 --> 36:10.467
I announced,
and less than a year later,

36:10.535 --> 36:12.535
That's exactly what I did.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.005
We sold 17,000 buns in our first
two months.

36:15.073 --> 36:16.306
[manjit] woo!

36:16.374 --> 36:19.209
But two years later, I decided
to close the storefront bakery

36:19.277 --> 36:22.345
And give our customers what
they'd been asking for:

36:22.347 --> 36:24.347
The ability to make our buns at
home.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.615
Hmm.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.217
And a growing line of spreads
too.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.119
And now I need your help to
spread the cinnamon goodness

36:30.188 --> 36:31.221
Across north america.

36:33.391 --> 36:35.992
So if you open your cloches,
I have made...

36:36.060 --> 36:37.327
[manjit] oh.

36:37.395 --> 36:40.363
[amy]...A cinnamon bun latte
using the cinnamon bun spread.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.397
[manjit] oh my gosh.

36:41.466 --> 36:42.566
And this was actually the
signature latte

36:42.634 --> 36:44.935
At balzac's cafés this winter.

36:46.404 --> 36:49.072
And of course you have a
cinnamon bun that I baked

36:49.074 --> 36:50.173
For you this morning.

36:50.241 --> 36:51.107
Oh my goodness.

36:51.109 --> 36:52.242
[dianne] amy's two products are
frozen,

36:52.310 --> 36:53.510
Ready-to-cook cinnamon buns.

36:54.078 --> 36:54.844
Oh my god.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.579
[dianne] and jars of cinnamon
spread,

36:56.648 --> 36:57.881
Which the dragons are sampling.

36:58.650 --> 36:59.849
[manjit] this is delicious!

36:59.851 --> 37:01.151
[dianne] the spreads are
available in three flavours

37:01.219 --> 37:03.186
And sell for about $10 at 60
local stores.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.455
So good.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.791
I'll give you $10 million for
20% of the business [laughs].

37:07.859 --> 37:08.992
-I accept that offer!
-[manjit] ignore that.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.761
[wes] this is good.

37:11.829 --> 37:13.796
So when you say,
"cinnamon bun spread"...

37:13.799 --> 37:14.798
[manjit] yeah.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.299
...People, they're like, "oh,
it's the icing."

37:16.367 --> 37:17.100
I'm like, "it's not the icing."

37:17.168 --> 37:18.335
Yeah, that's what I thought
too.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.702
Where I got the idea is it's the
filling for the cinnamon bun.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.271
-Yeah.
-[wes] wow.

37:21.339 --> 37:24.307
[amy] I'm a freelance journalist
and a cookbook author.

37:24.375 --> 37:25.875
These are all my recipes.

37:25.943 --> 37:27.477
So there's no other product out
there that is

37:27.479 --> 37:28.545
A cinnamon bun spread.

37:30.648 --> 37:31.514
But what's your sales like?

37:31.582 --> 37:32.682
Tell us about that.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.618
Sales to date for everything,
which is about three years

37:35.687 --> 37:37.654
Of business, is $800,000.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.524
-How about the last 12 months?
-$250,000.

37:41.592 --> 37:42.792
-$250,000, okay.
-[amy] yeah.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.627
So you haven't had much growth
in year over year

37:44.696 --> 37:45.929
The last three years.

37:45.997 --> 37:49.132
The first two years was only the
bakery, and we averaged $200,000

37:49.200 --> 37:50.433
In sales each year.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.168
Are the margins better here
then?

37:52.170 --> 37:53.970
-[amy] way better!
-Okay, what are the margins?

37:54.039 --> 37:58.975
So the margins, I make the jars
and sell them for $3.50

37:58.977 --> 38:01.211
To my local distributor for $5.

38:03.147 --> 38:05.715
How much money did you make?

38:05.717 --> 38:06.649
What was your gross?

38:06.652 --> 38:07.851
What was your net?

38:07.919 --> 38:13.856
Okay, so that was the gross,
and I would say the net was--

38:13.925 --> 38:16.059
Your gross is how much money you
made after paying all your

38:16.061 --> 38:17.226
Cost of goods, your expenses.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.728
-[michele] yeah.
-[amy] right.

38:20.265 --> 38:21.064
Okay, let's just go to the
bottom line then.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.065
-What was the net?
-Right.

38:22.067 --> 38:26.302
So the net was $100,000.

38:26.371 --> 38:27.970
Okay, so then you paid
yourself--

38:28.039 --> 38:29.205
[wes] that's how much you took
home to pay yourself, right,

38:29.274 --> 38:30.140
To pay your bills
and everything.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.308
-Is that the deal?
-So here's the thing.

38:32.377 --> 38:33.276
[manjit] it doesn't make
sense--

38:33.278 --> 38:34.477
It doesn't make sense.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.512
Let me get one number right.

38:36.515 --> 38:40.417
♪ ♪

38:41.452 --> 38:43.653
Okay, we've always been
profitable.

38:43.721 --> 38:47.290
-Okay, good start.
-So I would say 25%.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.296
You don't like that number, 25%.

38:53.898 --> 38:55.865
No, we don't like that you don't
know the number.

38:55.933 --> 38:59.135
I swear I'm prepared, I'm
just--I really have

38:59.203 --> 39:00.103
A problem with math.

39:00.171 --> 39:00.837
Like, it's not that I don't know
the numbers,

39:00.905 --> 39:01.671
It's that I have a--

39:01.673 --> 39:02.972
[wes] but, amy, that's fine.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.640
If you have a right investor,
they'll help you with that.

39:04.709 --> 39:06.409
So the question really is why
are you here?

39:07.011 --> 39:08.578
What are you really looking for
from us?

39:08.646 --> 39:10.080
So I'm stuck in second gear.

39:11.783 --> 39:14.717
I think I make great products
and everyone wants them,

39:14.786 --> 39:17.754
I just have not been able to get
outside of ontario.

39:20.124 --> 39:21.958
So what haven't you been able to
do,

39:22.026 --> 39:22.992
Sign up with a
national distributor?

39:23.061 --> 39:27.230
Yeah, I've had a couple of just
bad distributors.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.234
The number one beef in any
consumer goods company is

39:31.302 --> 39:33.536
That they have the wrong
distributor, just so you know,

39:33.538 --> 39:35.638
But it never is always the
distributor's fault,

39:35.706 --> 39:36.939
Just so you know, so.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.675
So, I've tried, and I have
failed.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.544
I feel like I've been robbed in
a way.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.046
They didn't do anything.

39:45.650 --> 39:46.582
I would love to!

39:46.651 --> 39:47.683
Yeah, I'm in it!

39:47.752 --> 39:48.351
[michele] okay, because this is
a world of sharks.

39:48.353 --> 39:49.085

39:49.153 --> 39:51.187

can't under--not can't

40:04.368 --> 40:07.670
Amy, I think you can do okay
small and regional and keep

40:07.738 --> 40:10.173
This a lifestyle business, but
you're not ready to go national.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.241
I'm out.

40:14.479 --> 40:16.045

40:16.047 --> 40:17.981
I can help surround you with
better people,

40:18.049 --> 40:19.816
But at the end of the day,
I need you to know basics.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.386

give you what you need in order

40:23.388 --> 40:25.955

40:41.772 --> 40:44.007
-I'll make you a deal.
-Okay.

40:44.809 --> 40:48.144
[vincenzo] because I'm actually
gonna probably have to run it.

40:48.213 --> 40:51.347
The deal is I'm gonna offer you
$200,000,

40:51.349 --> 40:53.283
But I want 45% of the business.

40:55.253 --> 40:58.087
-Thank you for your offer.
-[whispering]

41:00.491 --> 41:03.559
Amy, listen, I have a policy
where I don't invest in people

41:03.562 --> 41:08.131
Or businesses that the principal
has a side hustle.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.299
I understand.

41:09.367 --> 41:13.503
So you're prepared to quit your
job if one of us invest

41:13.505 --> 41:14.771
With you, right?

41:14.839 --> 41:16.239
I have complete dedication to
this.

41:17.242 --> 41:19.775
I also really enjoy being a
journalist and writing

41:19.778 --> 41:22.378
Cookbooks, and I think I can do
both.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.783
I have been listening to you for
a while now, and you know what,

41:27.852 --> 41:32.055
What's clear to me is that you
don't know how to run a business

41:32.123 --> 41:33.790
But you do know how to make
great cinnamon buns.

41:34.625 --> 41:38.427
-What if, just hypothetically...
-Yes.

41:38.430 --> 41:44.066
...I can convince michele and
arlene to come in with me,

41:44.069 --> 41:48.638
And we make an offer for
$300,000 for 100%

41:48.640 --> 41:50.740
Of the business, and then
you can work with us.

41:51.343 --> 41:53.276
You get a royalty when we sell
stuff.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.844
And you're like the face.

41:54.912 --> 41:56.212
It's still your brand,
we keep your name,

[arlene] we own the ip on the
product though.
