WEBVTT

00:02.120 --> 00:04.960
- I'm checking in to historic Brick Hotel

00:04.960 --> 00:08.640
in Newtown, Pennsylvania where
I meet an overbearing owner

00:08.640 --> 00:11.290
who has run her business into the ground.

00:11.290 --> 00:12.850
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:12.850 --> 00:14.800
- And what was once a proud landmark...

00:16.082 --> 00:18.568
Are they bullet holes in
the wall? That's mould.

00:18.568 --> 00:19.401
(gasps)

00:19.401 --> 00:20.800
Is now suffering from neglect.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.453
This place is disgusting.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.060
The road ahead is not
gonna be easy for me.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.900
I tried to get through to the owner,

00:28.900 --> 00:30.783
who's totally oblivious.

00:34.578 --> 00:37.161
(upbeat music)

00:40.180 --> 00:42.830
30 miles north of
Philadelphia lies the borough

00:42.830 --> 00:44.330
of Newtown, Pennsylvania,

00:44.330 --> 00:46.173
home to this historic Brick Hotel.

00:47.510 --> 00:49.637
Owner Verindar Kaur, a former therapist,

00:49.637 --> 00:52.880
bought the property in
2006 with her son CJ,

00:52.880 --> 00:56.210
who serves as a silent
partner in the business.

00:56.210 --> 00:57.390
- We bought the Brick Hotel

00:57.390 --> 00:59.480
because it was an investment opportunity.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.740
When we first purchased the place,

01:01.740 --> 01:04.769
we were told that it was
gonna be sort of a hands-off.

01:04.769 --> 01:05.850
It'll run itself.

01:05.850 --> 01:07.020
You just have to watch it.

01:07.020 --> 01:10.880
- Of course, we had no idea,

01:10.880 --> 01:14.093
zero idea, what this business is about.

01:17.530 --> 01:19.227
I always said to my son,

01:19.227 --> 01:20.897
"Maybe this year, we'll make a profit."

01:20.897 --> 01:22.900
"Maybe this year, we'll make a profit,"

01:22.900 --> 01:24.150
and it never happened.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.410
- She used to be in family therapy,

01:25.410 --> 01:26.820
so patience comes with that job,

01:26.820 --> 01:29.290
and I've seen her have a short fuse

01:29.290 --> 01:33.110
where she wouldn't do that
before we bought the place.

01:33.110 --> 01:34.340
When I came here,

01:34.340 --> 01:37.470
it blew my mind away that
we're still putting in money,

01:37.470 --> 01:39.390
so I cut out a lot of stuff here,

01:39.390 --> 01:44.390
and it really annoyed
and irritated people,

01:44.680 --> 01:49.680
and they basically started
the dislike Verindar plan.

01:56.130 --> 01:59.587
- It has been a bit of a
dictatorship here with Verindar.

01:59.587 --> 02:03.240
You know, it's either
her way or not her way.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.400
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.610
- Verindar is a control freak.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.949
She is involved in everything.

02:08.949 --> 02:13.560
She will not release or
relinquish control ever.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.420
- Here is a bowl.

02:14.420 --> 02:15.470
You want me to put it in?

02:15.470 --> 02:16.770
- She's not a people person.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.750
She has no people skills.

02:18.750 --> 02:22.840
She just screams out demands,
and she's very rude at times.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.446
- Paul! French onion on here, now.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.370
- There is such a turnover with staff

02:27.370 --> 02:29.690
that I don't even know their names.

02:29.690 --> 02:33.770
- In eight months, I've
probably seen over 50 people go.

02:33.770 --> 02:35.880
Some people come in for one shift,

02:35.880 --> 02:38.100
and they listen to her for five minutes,

02:38.100 --> 02:40.310
and they roll right out the door.

02:40.310 --> 02:44.700
- I wish I had two clones
of me, and believe me,

02:44.700 --> 02:46.163
this place would be happy.

02:49.150 --> 02:50.810
- I feel the Brick might have become,

02:50.810 --> 02:53.960
like the laughing stock of Newtown.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.580
- So the reputation around
town is that, you know,

02:56.580 --> 02:59.690
no non, so they call me the
crazy lady, which is fine to me.

02:59.690 --> 03:00.523
You know what?

03:00.523 --> 03:01.356
If I'm crazy because

03:01.356 --> 03:03.960
I'm trying to save the business, so be it.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.220
- I think we're at that point

03:05.220 --> 03:07.860
where this is really our last chance.

03:07.860 --> 03:10.340
If we don't figure something out,

03:10.340 --> 03:12.710
it's either sell it, get rid of it,

03:12.710 --> 03:14.423
because we can't sustain it.

03:17.589 --> 03:20.172
(upbeat music)

03:26.021 --> 03:27.110
- Before I came to town,

03:27.110 --> 03:30.090
I heard the Brick Hotel
had a high turnover rate,

03:30.090 --> 03:32.450
so I had my team reach
out to former employees

03:32.450 --> 03:35.463
so I can get some information
before checking in.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.987
First of all, good morning.

03:38.987 --> 03:39.920
- [All] Good morning.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.734
I've never met such a
large team of ex-employees.

03:43.734 --> 03:45.283
- [Kathy] Small showing.

03:45.283 --> 03:46.116
- This is a small showing?

03:46.116 --> 03:47.590
- [All] Yes.
- What, there's more?

03:47.590 --> 03:49.614
- [Woman] There's a lot more.
- [Kim] Hundreds.

03:49.614 --> 03:50.572
- [Woman] There's a lot more.

03:50.572 --> 03:51.405
- Hundreds?

03:51.405 --> 03:52.430
- [Woman] I would say hundreds.

03:52.430 --> 03:55.450
- How much turnover is there with staff?

03:55.450 --> 03:59.990
- When I left, Verindar had
been through almost 50 managers.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.030
- 15?

04:01.030 --> 04:01.940
- 50.

04:01.940 --> 04:03.173
- 50 managers?
- 50.

04:04.501 --> 04:06.780
- And the biggest problem
with the place is what?

04:06.780 --> 04:10.593
- Verindar. She's been cruel to people.

04:10.593 --> 04:11.426
I've watched her.

04:11.426 --> 04:13.690
And she's mean, and she can be a bully,

04:13.690 --> 04:16.613
and I've seen her reduce people to tears.

04:17.552 --> 04:19.050
- Wow, that's terrible.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.500
- There's so much neglect
between not only the staff,

04:22.500 --> 04:26.210
her managers, but her customers as well.

04:26.210 --> 04:27.043
- Seriously?

04:28.430 --> 04:29.680
- I couldn't take it anymore.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.430
I worked the holiday season,

04:31.430 --> 04:34.490
and it was kind of like
the last straw for me.

04:34.490 --> 04:35.510
- And what made you quit?

04:35.510 --> 04:37.210
- I worked all of those parties

04:37.210 --> 04:39.050
through the whole month of December.

04:39.050 --> 04:42.640
I was lucky to receive some
payback, like, in February.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.490
- With your tips?

04:43.490 --> 04:45.770
- Yeah, she'll cut you
a check in six weeks

04:45.770 --> 04:46.800
when she feels like it.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.830
She wouldn't let you go
pick up your paycheck.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.970
She'd call the cops on you.

04:50.970 --> 04:52.890
- You said she'd call the cops on you?

04:52.890 --> 04:53.723
- [Kim] All the time.

04:53.723 --> 04:55.110
- [Kathy] On everybody.
- [James] Numerous times.

04:55.110 --> 04:57.570
- Seriously, call the police
because you wanted your money?

04:57.570 --> 04:58.732
- Yes.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.565
- You were threatening her.

04:59.565 --> 05:00.810
- Seriously, I mean, it
sounds like a dictatorship

05:00.810 --> 05:03.540
as opposed to a boss
that's there to support.

05:03.540 --> 05:04.570
- People loved it there.

05:04.570 --> 05:05.510
It was very homey.

05:05.510 --> 05:06.490
The opposite of now.

05:06.490 --> 05:07.720
All the locals came.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.450
We had a booming hotel business.

05:09.450 --> 05:10.283
- Wow.

05:10.283 --> 05:11.330
- It was such a great place.

05:11.330 --> 05:14.420
And then the quality just
steadily went downhill,

05:14.420 --> 05:17.910
and I think she had a complete
lack of respect for the staff

05:17.910 --> 05:20.823
and didn't understand that
your staff is a huge asset.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.459
- What a mess.

05:23.459 --> 05:24.380
- Can I ask a question?
- Please.

05:24.380 --> 05:25.490
- Have you met her?

05:25.490 --> 05:26.580
- No, I just arrived.

05:26.580 --> 05:27.690
Seriously, flew into Philly this morning.

05:27.690 --> 05:29.750
- Oh, see you are in for a treat.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.640
I was curious just by
the way you were speaking

05:31.640 --> 05:33.940
because I thought, "He
hasn't met her yet, has he?"

05:33.940 --> 05:34.773
- No, no, no.

05:34.773 --> 05:38.563
So calling the cops, you
know, high staff turnover,

05:39.450 --> 05:42.510
standards dropping, I
haven't got much confidence.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.443
However, I'm gonna tackle it head on,

05:45.937 --> 05:47.694
and you don't look very
optimistic, do you?

05:47.694 --> 05:48.527
(all laugh)

05:48.527 --> 05:50.097
- I believe that you can do it.

05:50.097 --> 05:50.930
- [Gordon] Thank you.
- I do too.

05:50.930 --> 05:51.870
- Well, wish me luck.
- [Maya] Good luck.

05:51.870 --> 05:53.083
- Thank you. Take care.

05:54.022 --> 05:56.605
(upbeat music)

05:58.360 --> 06:00.003
Wow, look at the size of this place.

06:02.230 --> 06:04.713
Oh, dear. What happened there?

06:06.308 --> 06:09.344
Damn. When did that happen?

06:09.344 --> 06:11.126
- You know, it's been
here since I've been here.

06:11.126 --> 06:11.959
- Oh, really?

06:11.959 --> 06:12.886
- Hi, I'm Maryanne. It's nice to meet you.

06:12.886 --> 06:13.719
- Maryanne, likewise.

06:13.719 --> 06:14.552
Good to see you.
- Welcome to the hotel.

06:14.552 --> 06:15.590
- I get a bit nervous
when I check into a hotel

06:15.590 --> 06:16.990
and the windows are smashed.

06:17.830 --> 06:18.840
Anyway, how are you?

06:18.840 --> 06:19.820
- I'm good, thank you.

06:19.820 --> 06:20.970
- I'm happy to be here.

06:22.097 --> 06:23.520
Are they bullet holes in the wall?

06:23.520 --> 06:25.310
- You know, they might very well be.

06:25.310 --> 06:28.290
I'm not sure what they are.
We're 250 years old, so...

06:28.290 --> 06:29.260
- 250 years old?

06:29.260 --> 06:30.370
- [Maryanne] Mm-hmm.

06:30.370 --> 06:31.310
- What's wrong with the place?

06:31.310 --> 06:32.450
- I think it's a beautiful place,

06:32.450 --> 06:36.120
but I think it really
just needs some upgrading.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.070
- And, which part's beautiful? Help me.

06:39.410 --> 06:41.160
Certainly not the entrance
with the smashed windows.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.550
- Well, I think it could be beautiful.

06:43.550 --> 06:44.383
- [Gordon] Yes.

06:44.383 --> 06:45.710
- [Maryanne] It's been
neglected for a while.

06:45.710 --> 06:47.686
- [Gordon] What happened here?

06:47.686 --> 06:49.999
- Oh... (laughing)

06:49.999 --> 06:52.114
Oh, my. (laughing)

06:52.114 --> 06:52.947
- Damn.

06:54.223 --> 06:58.042
- Oh, my. Oh. (laughs)

06:58.042 --> 07:01.727
- That looks much better.
Wow. Dear, oh, dear.

07:01.727 --> 07:04.323
- I don't know; Verindar's
not gonna be too happy.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.600
- I can't believe he just
ripped the wallpaper down.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.630
That was fantastic.

07:07.630 --> 07:09.230
- What time's the owner calling in?

07:09.230 --> 07:10.830
- She might be here. I can check for you.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.437
- I'd love to meet her.

07:12.437 --> 07:13.983
- Oh, he's bringing Verindar up.

07:16.072 --> 07:17.000
- [Maryanne] Verindar.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.660
- Hi.

07:18.660 --> 07:19.493
- How are you?

07:19.493 --> 07:20.420
- Good. How are you?

07:20.420 --> 07:21.487
- Very well. A little nervous.

07:21.487 --> 07:24.040
The smashed glass, what happened there?

07:24.040 --> 07:26.657
- It's been there since
before I bought it.

07:26.657 --> 07:27.910
- Oh, how long have you had the hotel?

07:27.910 --> 07:28.743
- 10 years.

07:28.743 --> 07:29.576
- 10 years.
- Yes.

07:29.576 --> 07:30.790
- And you didn't think about replacing it?

07:30.790 --> 07:33.472
First impression as customers
walk through the door?

07:33.472 --> 07:34.305
- It's original.

07:34.305 --> 07:36.097
- Have you been drinking?

07:36.097 --> 07:36.930
(scoffs and laughs)

07:36.930 --> 07:38.193
You look like I drink?

07:39.450 --> 07:41.894
- Did you run a hotel before
you bought this 10 years ago?

07:41.894 --> 07:42.727
- No, never.

07:42.727 --> 07:43.560
- No?

07:43.560 --> 07:44.393
- Never. No.

07:44.393 --> 07:45.870
- No, what did you do?

07:45.870 --> 07:47.770
- Therapist for children.

07:47.770 --> 07:50.670
I did that for 20 years,
so that was my practise.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.520
- Wow, okay, 201.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.840
I'll see you shortly.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.900
I'm gonna go and check in and unpack.

07:57.900 --> 07:58.733
- Okay.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.143
- Place is filthy.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.419
Ugh.

08:10.236 --> 08:12.486
What in the fuck? Maryanne.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.651
I need a rag, napkin...
- [Maryanne] Okay.

08:15.651 --> 08:17.878
- Or housekeeping, please.

08:17.878 --> 08:19.681
(chuckles)

08:19.681 --> 08:20.660
- [Gordon] God.
- [Maryanne] Oh, my.

08:20.660 --> 08:23.770
- What... Is that...ugh.

08:26.047 --> 08:26.880
- Oh.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.090
- Oh, Jesus.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.710
- [Maryanne] Let me get
housekeeping for you.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.853
- Housekeeping? Call fire brigade.

08:33.289 --> 08:35.250
Hello. Are you the housekeeper?

08:35.250 --> 08:37.111
- I'm not. I'm looking for her.

08:37.111 --> 08:37.945
I'm Caitlin.

08:37.945 --> 08:38.778
- Caitlin, pleased to meet you.

08:38.778 --> 08:39.676
Sorry, my hands are dirty,

08:39.676 --> 08:40.519
so I'm just going to
shake hands like that.

08:40.519 --> 08:41.352
- Excuse me. Yes.

08:41.352 --> 08:42.184
- I don't want to shake hands like that.

08:42.184 --> 08:43.018
- [Caitlin] Sure, no.

08:43.018 --> 08:44.900
- When was the last time
this place was cleaned?

08:44.900 --> 08:46.670
There's dust and shit everywhere.

08:46.670 --> 08:48.550
- Talaya's here every day.

08:48.550 --> 08:50.200
So I would assume...

08:50.200 --> 08:51.033
- Right.

08:51.033 --> 08:52.198
- Cleaning.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.069
- I mean under here.

08:53.069 --> 08:55.040
Look, I'm not talking about
a couple of weeks of dust;

08:55.040 --> 08:56.280
I'm talking years.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.780
And behind here as well, look.

08:58.759 --> 08:59.592
- Hi, Talaya.
- [Gordon] What?

08:59.592 --> 09:00.425
- Hi.

09:00.425 --> 09:02.624
- Oh, jeez, how are you.

09:02.624 --> 09:03.457
- Oh, hi.

09:03.457 --> 09:04.290
- [Gordon] Are you good?

09:04.290 --> 09:05.123
- Yes, I'm fine.

09:05.123 --> 09:06.637
- [Gordon] Fine, right. What do you do?

09:06.637 --> 09:07.470
- Yes, housekeeping.

09:07.470 --> 09:09.350
- Stop. Which house?

09:09.350 --> 09:10.250
- This house.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.432
- Come over. Look at the mess down there.

09:13.432 --> 09:15.370
What's that? What's that? Fabu--

09:15.370 --> 09:16.203
- Fabuloso.

09:16.203 --> 09:18.140
- Let's get the place cleaned fabulous.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.890
Let's just have a little test here.

09:21.222 --> 09:24.405
Mm, look at that. Look at that.

09:24.405 --> 09:26.970
Do you have a programme that
you clean floor by floor?

09:26.970 --> 09:29.810
- A programme? No.

09:29.810 --> 09:33.805
- No. Where is my room, -- what is that?

09:33.805 --> 09:34.930
- [Caitlin] 201 is--
- [Gordon] Jesus.

09:34.930 --> 09:35.763
- [Talaya] You're room?

09:35.763 --> 09:36.903
- No, what's that up there.

09:38.460 --> 09:39.633
Who sits here?

09:41.460 --> 09:42.293
- [Caitlin] Aesthetics?

09:42.293 --> 09:44.230
- Is it a fucking tea party for rats

09:44.230 --> 09:46.387
or Stuart Little in for dinner tonight?

09:46.387 --> 09:48.880
What the fuck is that?

09:48.880 --> 09:49.713
- [Talaya] Oh, my.

09:49.713 --> 09:51.173
- What is it, like, pet corner?

09:52.250 --> 09:54.100
We drop our cats off for dinner here?

09:56.320 --> 09:58.963
Who... Jesus.

09:59.989 --> 10:02.350
Man, who does this?

10:02.350 --> 10:04.437
You care to join me? Come up.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.715
(all laugh)

10:06.715 --> 10:08.250
- Go. Go for it, my dear.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.731
(Talaya laughs)

10:09.731 --> 10:11.561
- Come on. Let's sit in the veranda.

10:11.561 --> 10:12.510
- [Talaya] Sure.

10:12.510 --> 10:14.861
- Let's talk about your
cleaning habits; take a seat.

10:14.861 --> 10:15.694
- I don't think I can fit right there.

10:15.694 --> 10:19.823
- No, no, my butt's way bigger
than yours, so take a seat.

10:21.450 --> 10:22.283
May we have some menus please?

10:22.283 --> 10:24.500
- Oh, sure. Absolutely.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.927
- So what in the fuck is going on?

10:27.927 --> 10:30.677
(dramatic music)

10:32.080 --> 10:35.230
- I actually said something
about that, but, you know...

10:36.700 --> 10:37.533
- You comfy?

10:38.630 --> 10:39.530
- Absolutely not.

10:39.530 --> 10:43.530
- No, all jokes apart, forget
the mice party, tea party,

10:43.530 --> 10:45.310
Stuart Little fucking hangout,

10:45.310 --> 10:47.230
what is the biggest problems here?

10:47.230 --> 10:48.356
'Cause I'm not--

10:48.356 --> 10:51.760
- Things like this. The mould, the...

10:51.760 --> 10:53.610
- The mould? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:53.610 --> 10:54.750
We got rid of the dust.

10:54.750 --> 10:55.583
What do you mean the mould?

10:55.583 --> 10:57.040
Where's the mould?

10:57.040 --> 10:59.460
- Oh, right, yes.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.430
- Take me to the mould.

11:01.430 --> 11:02.263
- Oh, okay.
- All right?

11:02.263 --> 11:03.096
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.610
- Let's start this way.

11:04.610 --> 11:05.810
- What, where?

11:05.810 --> 11:07.567
- Let's go this way...
To the mould, first.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.484
- We're going up. Mould.

11:11.431 --> 11:12.977
- So I guess it starts, I don't
know exactly where it comes,

11:12.977 --> 11:15.700
but it comes from somewhere
on the shower curtains.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.800
I asked her, "Can we
change it?" She said, "No."

11:16.800 --> 11:17.870
- There is mould.

11:17.870 --> 11:19.790
Did you tell the owner
to change these out?

11:19.790 --> 11:20.750
- Yes, sir.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.140
- And any response?

11:22.140 --> 11:23.110
- [Talaya] She'll get to it.

11:23.110 --> 11:26.663
- Ugh, look at this.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.373
Look at that. Come over.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.460
- [Talaya] Is that mould?

11:33.460 --> 11:34.660
- [Gordon] That is mould.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.290
- Yes, I said that.

11:36.290 --> 11:39.784
- [Gordon] That's mould. See it?

11:39.784 --> 11:40.823
- Mm-hmm.

11:40.823 --> 11:44.010
- Bloody hell. When was
all the linen last changed?

11:44.010 --> 11:45.860
Look at the colour of this.

11:45.860 --> 11:48.350
How much sweat is on there?

11:48.350 --> 11:50.150
- Oh, man.
- [Gordon] Look.

11:50.150 --> 11:50.983
- Oh.

11:50.983 --> 11:52.440
- [Gordon] Look at the colour of that.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.750
- [Talaya] So that's what that is? Sweat?

11:53.750 --> 11:55.350
- That's sweat.

11:55.350 --> 11:58.530
And then is that a tube television?

11:58.530 --> 12:03.260
How old? Have you ever
heard of a flat-screen?

12:03.260 --> 12:04.870
- Yeah, I got five.

12:04.870 --> 12:06.530
- You've got five flat-screens?

12:06.530 --> 12:07.363
- At my house.

12:07.363 --> 12:10.750
- For-- what a mess.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.770
What's that in there?

12:12.770 --> 12:16.350
What... A empty box of tights?

12:16.350 --> 12:17.550
Silk Perfections. Jesus.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.130
Does the owner ever come into these rooms?

12:23.130 --> 12:24.130
- Since I've been here,

12:24.130 --> 12:26.590
I've probably seen her in here maybe once.

12:26.590 --> 12:28.610
- Once upon a time,
these were white, right?

12:28.610 --> 12:29.443
You see these?

12:29.443 --> 12:31.780
Look at the colour of them.

12:31.780 --> 12:33.970
How grey and dirty.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.030
God, they stink.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.070
- Oh, you can tell.

12:36.070 --> 12:38.440
They supposed to been white. Oh, man.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.050
- I was worried about your
eyes for a second there.

12:41.050 --> 12:42.250
Where's my room, please?

12:43.155 --> 12:44.510
- [Talaya] 201.

12:44.510 --> 12:46.663
- Please tell me it's
not worse than this one.

12:47.724 --> 12:51.573
201. Bloody hell.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.590
What a mess.

12:54.590 --> 12:56.480
Dust everywhere, and all this.

12:56.480 --> 13:00.453
What is this? Terrible.

13:01.720 --> 13:02.949
- Girl...

13:02.949 --> 13:03.782
- How you doing?

13:03.782 --> 13:05.667
- He found all the nasty.

13:05.667 --> 13:06.500
- Oh, no.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.063
- No, I thought that
the curtains were gold.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.350
No, for real.

13:12.350 --> 13:15.160
They were supposed to be white.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.220
- Oh, my goodness.

13:16.220 --> 13:17.183
- I am appalled.

13:18.181 --> 13:21.113
- And then, just underneath it all,

13:22.260 --> 13:23.590
right now, it's pretty obvious

13:23.590 --> 13:28.360
that the owner doesn't even put a cent

13:28.360 --> 13:31.363
back into this room, even into the hotel.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.580
But when an owner can't be bothered

13:35.580 --> 13:38.540
to change a smashed window in reception,

13:38.540 --> 13:40.630
I don't hold much hope
for the rest of the hotel.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.023
And look at up there.

13:43.270 --> 13:47.240
What's that? Check out time 11 a.m.

13:47.240 --> 13:50.369
Yeah, I'll check out way
before that, my love.

13:50.369 --> 13:52.952
(gentle music)

13:56.780 --> 13:59.214
- Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Tammy.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.290
- Likewise, Gordon. Good to see you.

14:00.290 --> 14:01.393
- Good to meet you.

14:01.393 --> 14:02.630
- And you're...

14:02.630 --> 14:03.930
- Sales and event
coordinator with the Brick.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.895
- Rumours has it, you do a lot of events.

14:05.895 --> 14:06.728
- We do a lot of events.

14:06.728 --> 14:07.960
- Wow, how many a week on average?

14:07.960 --> 14:09.480
- About 350 a year.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.320
- Sounds like this is the oxygen

14:11.320 --> 14:12.910
that's keeping this place alive.

14:12.910 --> 14:14.980
- Unfortunately, that's the truth.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.600
- Wow, what other problems
are there? Help me.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.490
- Staffing is terrible.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.698
- Why are there so many
staff going through the door?

14:22.698 --> 14:23.531
What is it?

14:23.531 --> 14:24.364
- Verindar is firing them.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.360
Often, I'll come in on Monday

14:25.360 --> 14:27.330
and see who didn't make
it through the weekend.

14:27.330 --> 14:28.980
She's very tough to work for.

14:28.980 --> 14:32.230
- The bottom line is,
the problem is the owner?

14:32.230 --> 14:34.700
- Yes, there's nobody else
here. It starts at the top.

14:34.700 --> 14:35.533
- I appreciate your honesty, thank you.

14:35.533 --> 14:37.240
- Well, we appreciate you being here.

14:38.100 --> 14:41.480
- After learning the hotels
revenue is strictly from events,

14:41.480 --> 14:43.700
I want to see how bad the food really is.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.310
Seasonal, local, fresh, hmm.

14:46.310 --> 14:49.450
I ordered a couple of items,
the French onion soup,

14:49.450 --> 14:50.970
which was tasteless...

14:50.970 --> 14:53.620
That's so bad. Terrible.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.833
So I opted for something
with a little more flavour.

15:00.656 --> 15:02.822
Mmm, that tastes better.

15:02.822 --> 15:03.655
- Mm.

15:03.655 --> 15:06.100
- Then I ordered something
I've never heard of before,

15:06.100 --> 15:08.560
a cauliflower steak, which by name,

15:08.560 --> 15:09.750
I should have known better.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.483
That is a mess, who put it on the menu?

15:12.483 --> 15:13.316
- Verindar.

15:13.316 --> 15:14.390
- And a crab sandwich,

15:14.390 --> 15:18.400
which maybe I would expect to
be frozen, but not from a can.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.629
Product of China. Fresh?

15:20.629 --> 15:21.462
- Mm-mm.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.820
- Seriously? Are we done?

15:22.820 --> 15:23.653
Is there a--did I--

15:23.653 --> 15:25.090
- You've got your burger still.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.770
- Do you know what? Cancel it.

15:26.770 --> 15:27.603
- Absolutely.

15:27.603 --> 15:28.790
- 'Cause if it's coming
from the same kitchen...

15:28.790 --> 15:29.850
Forget it, yeah?
- Got it.

15:29.850 --> 15:30.910
- Tell the chef I travel light

15:30.910 --> 15:32.800
and I haven't got that many
fucking pairs of knickers.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.920
Thank you.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.968
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my
gosh, he's freaking out.

15:35.968 --> 15:36.903
- What happened?

15:36.903 --> 15:38.010
- He's freaking out.

15:38.010 --> 15:40.000
Cancel everything else.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.880
No more. No more.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.117
He said, "Enough."

15:47.704 --> 15:48.537
- Take me to the kitchen.

15:48.537 --> 15:51.543
Introduce me to the team. Place is huge.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.433
Kitchen is massive.

15:56.058 --> 15:57.540
So where's the chef?

15:57.540 --> 15:58.550
- Macio.
- Hello.

15:58.550 --> 15:59.704
- [Macio] I'm not the chef.

15:59.704 --> 16:00.630
- You're not the chef?

16:00.630 --> 16:01.845
- [Macio] How you doing? Nice to meet you.

16:01.845 --> 16:02.678
- You are a chef, though.
You got a jacket on.

16:02.678 --> 16:03.742
- Yes, sir.

16:03.742 --> 16:05.010
- That's how chefs tend to dress.

16:05.010 --> 16:06.260
- Yes.
- Macio.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.093
- Nice to meet you.

16:07.093 --> 16:07.926
- Likewise. Good to meet you too.

16:07.926 --> 16:08.759
And this is?
- Barry.

16:08.759 --> 16:09.592
- Barry Sexton.

16:09.592 --> 16:10.880
- Barry, so you're the chef?

16:10.880 --> 16:11.960
- You got it. I'm not the chef.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.210
- No, you're the chef?

16:13.210 --> 16:14.470
- A chef, but the not the chef.

16:14.470 --> 16:15.590
- A chef.

16:15.590 --> 16:16.600
- There's two of them.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.154
- There's two of them?

16:18.154 --> 16:19.291
- They're the ones, uh--

16:19.291 --> 16:20.124
- But where's the head chef?

16:20.124 --> 16:22.310
- Well, we have both of them in charge.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.143
- No such thing.

16:23.143 --> 16:25.370
Your set of rules and your set of rules

16:25.370 --> 16:26.710
doesn't benefit the customers.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.420
I'll come back to the food in a minute.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.200
I'm in shock.

16:30.200 --> 16:35.200
Before I got here, I met a
dozen of your ex-employees.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.313
- Okay.

16:36.313 --> 16:38.790
- I couldn't believe the amount of staff

16:38.790 --> 16:41.540
that have left this building
in the last two years.

16:41.540 --> 16:44.210
Why are you going through so many staff?

16:44.210 --> 16:46.202
- I don't know.

16:46.202 --> 16:47.035
- You don't know?

16:47.035 --> 16:49.840
- I think I hire people, and, uh...

16:49.840 --> 16:52.850
- Oh, so it's them not
good enough for you?

16:52.850 --> 16:53.683
- Yes.

16:55.280 --> 17:00.280
- When you have a young member
of staff that is owed money

17:01.800 --> 17:04.579
and they won't leave the
building till you pay them

17:04.579 --> 17:06.430
and you call the police on them,

17:06.430 --> 17:09.315
what kind of business
are you running here?

17:09.315 --> 17:10.147
- Who said that?

17:10.147 --> 17:14.180
- Are you saying now that
they're lying? Please.

17:14.180 --> 17:15.067
- I don't know because I've--

17:15.067 --> 17:17.450
- Are you saying they're
lying? Simple yes or no.

17:17.450 --> 17:18.888
- I cannot tell people...
If they're lying.

17:18.888 --> 17:19.722
- You cannot tell?

17:19.722 --> 17:21.305
- It's inaccurate, though. I do--

17:21.305 --> 17:22.560
- It's inaccurate?
- Yes.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.980
- I have witnessed Verindar call the cops

17:24.980 --> 17:26.060
on a number of people.

17:26.060 --> 17:28.040
She has a close relationship

17:28.040 --> 17:29.790
with the Newtown Police Department.

17:30.740 --> 17:32.383
- Do you care about this hotel?

17:33.380 --> 17:34.213
It's not funny.

17:34.213 --> 17:35.660
I mean, I am not here to laugh.

17:35.660 --> 17:36.710
Let's get that right.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.580
Let's move on to my
reception when I walked in,

17:40.580 --> 17:43.010
and there's dust and shit everywhere.

17:43.010 --> 17:43.843
When I say dust,

17:43.843 --> 17:47.303
I'm talking dust that's
been embedded for years,

17:48.230 --> 17:51.030
and there's mould on the carpet.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.840
I'm a little bit lost for words.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.150
Ever sat down in the
restaurant and had dinner?

17:55.150 --> 17:55.983
- No.

17:55.983 --> 17:56.816
- Right.

17:56.816 --> 18:01.310
Top of your menu, it's,
"Fresh...seasonal...local."

18:02.270 --> 18:03.103
It's canned food.

18:03.103 --> 18:07.290
- I'm not a chef, and I
don't know all these things.

18:07.290 --> 18:08.933
- What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

18:08.933 --> 18:10.526
- No, I need to take something
out of the oven, chef.

18:10.526 --> 18:11.359
- Well, you take it out of the oven.

18:11.359 --> 18:12.970
What is this? Tomorrow's chicken?

18:14.430 --> 18:15.263
See, you laugh.

18:16.890 --> 18:18.550
What is this?

18:18.550 --> 18:22.203
A game? You have to fucking wake up.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.467
(upbeat music)

18:27.710 --> 18:28.824
- [Guest] Hi.

18:28.824 --> 18:30.681
- [Jessica] Hey, guys. How are you?

18:30.681 --> 18:31.514
- [Guest] Good, how are you?

18:31.514 --> 18:33.333
- [Jessica] Excited?
- Yes, we're checking in.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.463
- [Jessica] No problem. Bye-bye.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.393
- Hi, how are you?

18:41.393 --> 18:42.226
- Hi, how are you?

18:42.226 --> 18:43.059
- Nice to meet you.

18:43.059 --> 18:43.892
- Likewise, first name is?
- I'm Jessica.

18:43.892 --> 18:44.725
- Jessica, good to see you.

18:44.725 --> 18:46.370
- I heard you had a great time today.

18:46.370 --> 18:48.541
- Great time, not, but...

18:48.541 --> 18:50.090
Yeah, let's wait and see, yeah?

18:50.090 --> 18:51.064
Who's that?

18:51.064 --> 18:53.310
- [Jessica] That is CJ.
That is Verindar's son.

18:53.310 --> 18:54.410
- Oh, CJ.

18:54.410 --> 18:56.540
- Hi, yes. I'm one of
the co-owners as well.

18:56.540 --> 18:57.540
- Good to meet you.

18:57.540 --> 18:58.800
How many times a week you here?

18:58.800 --> 19:02.350
- I'm here, right now, probably
less than once a month even.

19:02.350 --> 19:05.450
I've got another job that
I pretty much do full time.

19:05.450 --> 19:06.283
- Okay, what do you do?

19:06.283 --> 19:07.116
- [CJ] Manage IT.

19:08.393 --> 19:10.080
- IT, wow. Why did you buy this?

19:10.080 --> 19:12.330
- Why did we buy this? It was
an investment opportunity.

19:12.330 --> 19:13.620
When we first got into it,

19:13.620 --> 19:15.690
we were told that it
was turnkey, hands-off.

19:15.690 --> 19:17.310
- So that was 10 years ago?

19:17.310 --> 19:18.469
- Yes.

19:18.469 --> 19:19.390
- Have you seen any return on that yet?

19:19.390 --> 19:20.223
- Zero.

19:20.223 --> 19:22.253
- Zero? When do you think it's coming?

19:23.176 --> 19:24.357
(laughs)

19:24.357 --> 19:26.300
Well, I have been talking about that

19:26.300 --> 19:28.117
quite a bit over the last six months...

19:28.117 --> 19:28.950
- Right.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.210
- Because, it's getting difficult
to keep putting money in.

19:31.210 --> 19:32.070
- Wow.

19:32.070 --> 19:35.163
In your mind, forget him,
what's wrong with the place?

19:36.060 --> 19:38.369
- I'm very sorry, 'cause
I know this is your mom...

19:38.369 --> 19:39.377
- It's okay.

19:39.377 --> 19:41.720
- But I can't deal with how she treats me.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.600
It's like when we don't need her here,

19:43.600 --> 19:48.080
she's here, and she's on me
about the smallest things.

19:48.080 --> 19:48.913
- Wow.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.060
Do you have one foot in their camp

19:51.060 --> 19:52.760
or one foot in your mother's camp?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.450
- I'm split between the two.

19:55.450 --> 19:57.137
I've actually had employees tell me,

19:57.137 --> 19:58.090
"Why aren't you around more?

19:58.090 --> 20:00.180
Because you're pleasant to deal with."

20:00.180 --> 20:01.410
- How's this gonna get turned around

20:01.410 --> 20:04.980
if she's still micromanaging
and dictating to everybody

20:04.980 --> 20:06.613
about how this place should be run?

20:08.220 --> 20:10.200
- She says if she's not here,

20:10.200 --> 20:13.510
it's, things will fall
apart and it won't get done.

20:13.510 --> 20:16.476
- That sounds right. (chuckles)

20:16.476 --> 20:17.309
- [Gordon] Oh, here's customers.

20:17.309 --> 20:18.142
- [Jessica] Hi, guys, how are you?

20:18.142 --> 20:19.060
- Good evening, welcome.

20:19.060 --> 20:20.616
How are you? You well?

20:20.616 --> 20:21.449
- [Jessica] You guys have a reservation?

20:21.449 --> 20:22.282
- Yeah, Weinstein.

20:22.282 --> 20:23.633
- Sorry about the smashed window.

20:24.670 --> 20:26.377
And the crab's from China.

20:26.377 --> 20:27.210
- The crab's from China.

20:27.210 --> 20:28.043
- Okay.
- Good crab in China?

20:28.043 --> 20:29.274
- You guys can follow me.

20:29.274 --> 20:31.393
- No... I don't go to China for crab.

20:33.872 --> 20:36.455
(upbeat music)

20:39.050 --> 20:40.560
- Gentlemen, I have one order for you.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.630
It's just a first course
on the first table.

20:42.630 --> 20:45.887
It's just two soup of the days. Thank you.

20:48.390 --> 20:49.749
- Okay, who's next?

20:49.749 --> 20:50.582
- Apple.

20:51.430 --> 20:53.388
I got all the soups, all right?

20:53.388 --> 20:54.621
- First thing is this.

20:54.621 --> 20:59.487
It's apple pear, no bleu
cheese, and a eggplant stack.

21:02.670 --> 21:05.700
Where's the apple pear?
Can we get this out?

21:05.700 --> 21:07.333
- Why is she doing this? Is
she always on the hot plate?

21:07.333 --> 21:09.020
- She is. She's never quiet.

21:09.020 --> 21:09.920
- [Verindar] Which ones are done?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.451
Can you guys take those
down? Is this done?

21:12.451 --> 21:13.284
- No.

21:13.284 --> 21:15.070
- No. I've taken my
stuff down that's done.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.264
- [Caitlin] Yeah.

21:16.264 --> 21:17.133
- Wow.
- It's a little aggravating.

21:18.150 --> 21:20.299
- Guys, waiting on the eggplant stack.

21:20.299 --> 21:21.340
- It's coming Verindar. It's coming.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.870
We're working it hard.
You making us nervous.

21:23.870 --> 21:24.900
- Oh, my goodness.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.233
Carly? Carly?

21:27.740 --> 21:29.232
- What? I'm coming.

21:29.232 --> 21:30.065
What is that?

21:30.065 --> 21:30.898
- Put those here. Take this.

21:30.898 --> 21:31.731
This is yours.

21:31.731 --> 21:32.602
- No, that is my New York strip.

21:32.602 --> 21:33.435
- (scoffs) No, it's not.

21:33.435 --> 21:34.770
- [Caitlin] This is craziness.

21:37.350 --> 21:38.943
- Who's doing the cauliflower?

21:39.870 --> 21:41.770
- Are you cooking the cauliflower now?

21:42.900 --> 21:43.750
- [Verindar] Yes.

21:45.922 --> 21:46.755
- She's fucking nuts.

21:46.755 --> 21:47.840
- I know she is. (laughs)

21:47.840 --> 21:48.907
- Swear to God.

21:48.907 --> 21:50.807
- [Verindar] Macio, can you flip this?

21:55.595 --> 21:56.428
- And what's she doing cooking?

21:56.428 --> 21:57.261
- I have no idea.

21:57.261 --> 21:58.094
- Does she normally cook?

21:58.094 --> 21:59.407
- [Caitlin] Yeah.

21:59.407 --> 22:01.007
- This is crazy. Absolute crazy.

22:06.710 --> 22:07.583
What a mess.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.370
Wheels are stuck,

22:11.370 --> 22:13.670
and it was just sliding
on the fucking grease.

22:14.626 --> 22:17.813
Ugh, God. That is gross.

22:19.106 --> 22:20.510
Verindar, you got two seconds?

22:20.510 --> 22:21.350
- Sure.

22:21.350 --> 22:22.900
- Just stand behind there, will you?

22:22.900 --> 22:23.810
- Oh, my goodness.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.980
- No, please stand behind there. I'm...

22:28.210 --> 22:29.203
- What is this?

22:33.059 --> 22:34.400
Macio, you guys just cleaned this.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.643
Is this from today?

22:37.560 --> 22:39.995
- I don't even know what's
back there, Verindar.

22:39.995 --> 22:42.910
- What? When was that cleaned?

22:42.910 --> 22:44.240
- They just cleaned it two days ago.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.217
They just spilled everything there.

22:46.217 --> 22:47.841
- Come here.

22:47.841 --> 22:52.589
I know hand in heart that
is not from yesterday.

22:52.589 --> 22:53.422
- No, not at all.

22:53.422 --> 22:55.178
- That is not from yesterday.

22:55.178 --> 22:57.030
What's that up there? Seriously?

22:57.030 --> 22:58.680
Watch your eyes. Watch your eyes.

23:00.130 --> 23:01.233
Who cleans this shit?

23:04.260 --> 23:05.210
Who is it?

23:05.210 --> 23:06.690
- Since I've been here...
No one's cleaned it.

23:06.690 --> 23:07.720
- Since you've been here...

23:07.720 --> 23:08.553
- No one's cleaned it.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.340
- I appreciate your honesty.

23:10.340 --> 23:11.190
Verindar?

23:11.190 --> 23:13.780
- Yeah? They say they--no.

23:13.780 --> 23:16.923
- Since he's been here,
he's never cleaned it.

23:18.100 --> 23:20.773
This place is disgusting.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.313
And this?

23:26.203 --> 23:29.203
- Well, Gordon, I don't come and do this.

23:29.203 --> 23:30.036
- You don't what?

23:30.036 --> 23:33.140
- I trust them that they
will clean where they are.

23:33.140 --> 23:35.890
You guys cleaned the floor
the other day, didn't you?

23:35.890 --> 23:37.360
- We cleaned the line the other day.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.480
We sweep the line.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.590
- You said you guys took out--

23:39.590 --> 23:40.624
- No, no.

23:40.624 --> 23:42.440
- I never said that.
- No, no, stop, stop.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.890
You're just trying to make excuses.

23:44.890 --> 23:48.210
Yes, you are. Aren't you embarrassed?

23:48.210 --> 23:49.043
- Very.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.340
- At least you told the fucking truth.

23:51.340 --> 23:52.573
The owner's in denial.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.290
That hasn't been pulled
out for fucking months.

23:56.290 --> 23:57.540
- That wasn't pulled out.

23:59.747 --> 24:01.073
- What a fucking mess.

24:02.544 --> 24:05.993
What is this? Bloody hell.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.210
Holy crap.

24:10.210 --> 24:12.186
- No, no, no, no, don't put in there.

24:12.186 --> 24:14.693
- Oh, my God, what in the fuck is that?

24:20.359 --> 24:23.080
- Oh, my God, what in the fuck is that?

24:23.080 --> 24:25.210
- That's grease from the hood.

24:25.210 --> 24:27.263
- Can you stop lying?

24:28.290 --> 24:29.770
That was not cleaned yesterday.

24:29.770 --> 24:31.450
- I'm telling you, this
is grease from the hood,

24:31.450 --> 24:32.490
but they haven't cleaned it.

24:32.490 --> 24:35.875
- Do you have any idea what'd
happen if that caught fire?

24:35.875 --> 24:36.708
- Well, I don't--

24:36.708 --> 24:40.663
- No, do you have any
idea if that caught fire?

24:41.607 --> 24:43.238
- Yeah, I do.

24:43.238 --> 24:47.397
- What're you doing? You stopped caring.

24:48.509 --> 24:51.040
- No, that's not true. I mean, I--

24:51.040 --> 24:53.163
- That's the sign of an owner that cares?

24:54.130 --> 24:55.510
I want an answer.

24:55.510 --> 24:57.200
I'm going upstairs; by
the time I come down,

24:57.200 --> 24:58.053
I want an answer.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.530
CJ, is he gone?

25:04.530 --> 25:06.040
- I don't know where he went.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.933
- Jesus. Oh, my God.

25:10.270 --> 25:15.270
Right. I'm unconvinced
that this place is clean...

25:18.550 --> 25:21.993
So I want to run a quick bacteria test.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.290
It looks disgusting.

25:25.189 --> 25:28.620
And I don't think these vents
have been cleaned for years.

25:28.620 --> 25:30.330
Time will tell.

25:30.330 --> 25:32.310
- Did you talk to Ramsay?

25:32.310 --> 25:33.143
- No.

25:33.143 --> 25:34.610
- He came down here looking for you.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.283
- In she goes.

25:38.193 --> 25:42.460
Now, 10 to 20's deemed as
sort of clean, respectable.

25:42.460 --> 25:47.060
Anything over 30 is unhygienic, dangerous.

25:47.060 --> 25:48.113
And this is reading.

25:49.247 --> 25:52.491
(machine beeps)

25:52.491 --> 25:53.574
573. Come in.

25:56.860 --> 25:58.040
- You were looking for me?

25:58.040 --> 25:58.873
- Sit down.

25:58.873 --> 25:59.770
- [CJ] What is that?

25:59.770 --> 26:04.540
- This is a very simple hygiene test.

26:04.540 --> 26:07.970
Anything above 30 is in the danger zone.

26:07.970 --> 26:08.803
- Okay.

26:08.803 --> 26:11.713
- 573 from the air conditioning unit.

26:14.302 --> 26:16.340
- (exhales) I don't
have an answer for that.

26:16.340 --> 26:19.000
Sorry. That's...

26:19.880 --> 26:21.360
- CJ...
- [CJ] Yeah.

26:21.360 --> 26:25.570
- 573. Let's do another one.

26:25.570 --> 26:27.220
How long has this chair been here?

26:27.220 --> 26:28.870
- [CJ] I believe since
we bought the place.

26:28.870 --> 26:31.630
- Have you seen the stains on it?

26:31.630 --> 26:32.550
See the stains there?

26:32.550 --> 26:33.383
- [CJ] Yeah.

26:35.283 --> 26:38.290
- Let's see what that says.
Do you ever stay here?

26:38.290 --> 26:39.460
- No, I've never stayed here.

26:39.460 --> 26:41.010
- You've never stayed here in 10 years?

26:41.010 --> 26:41.843
- No.

26:41.843 --> 26:43.240
- Wow, so you bought a hotel.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.270
You invested in it with mum,
and you've never stayed here.

26:46.270 --> 26:47.203
I'm amazed.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.653
446.

26:54.314 --> 26:55.700
And you've got no idea it's like this.

26:55.700 --> 26:57.832
What's the bathrooms like?

26:57.832 --> 26:58.665
Oh, my God.

27:01.390 --> 27:03.330
Do you know the shower curtains
have got mould on them?

27:03.330 --> 27:04.900
- No, I did not.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.340
- Your housekeeper pointed it out.

27:07.340 --> 27:08.700
Oh, there's hairs there.

27:08.700 --> 27:12.540
At this rate, I really
should be wearing gloves.

27:12.540 --> 27:13.373
Oh, dear.

27:15.380 --> 27:16.530
A shower curtain.

27:22.241 --> 27:27.241
5680. What in the fuck?

27:28.090 --> 27:29.073
Seriously?

27:35.807 --> 27:39.020
- I don't have an answer for that at all.

27:39.020 --> 27:44.020
- 5,680. That is the
volume of live bacteria.

27:47.510 --> 27:49.930
I'm gonna wash my hands. Fucking hell.

27:54.070 --> 27:57.680
5000. What in the hell's going on?

27:58.930 --> 28:01.809
I'm gonna go and just check 301.

28:01.809 --> 28:02.990
(knocks on door)

28:02.990 --> 28:03.823
Sorry to disturb you.

28:03.823 --> 28:04.656
Are you up? I'm so sorry.

28:04.656 --> 28:05.489
Do you mind?

28:05.489 --> 28:06.720
Listen, we've got some issues downstairs

28:06.720 --> 28:08.170
and found some pretty horrific stuff.

28:08.170 --> 28:09.297
I know you're getting
ready for bed; I'm sorry.

28:09.297 --> 28:10.980
- [Guest] That's okay.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.154
- I honestly didn't think

28:12.154 --> 28:14.130
they were gonna put anyone in here today.

28:14.130 --> 28:15.738
Shit. Oh, my, look.

28:15.738 --> 28:16.660
I'm sorry.
- [Guest] What is it?

28:16.660 --> 28:18.505
- [Gordon] That's mould underneath.

28:18.505 --> 28:19.338
(gasps)

28:19.338 --> 28:20.171
- No, you did not.

28:20.171 --> 28:21.370
Did--no, you did not.

28:21.370 --> 28:22.413
Really? No, ooh. Gross.

28:24.243 --> 28:26.800
- That is disgusting, and
I did a bacteria test;

28:26.800 --> 28:27.720
I've been doing them all day.

28:27.720 --> 28:30.402
On my shower curtain was mould.

28:30.402 --> 28:31.235
(gasps)

28:31.235 --> 28:32.068
- I just took a shower.

28:32.068 --> 28:34.860
- Shit. Will you just
give me two minutes, okay?

28:34.860 --> 28:36.269
- Oh, my god.

28:36.269 --> 28:38.436
(exhales)

28:40.572 --> 28:42.905
What a joke. This is insane.

28:44.406 --> 28:48.288
Fuck it. I'm done. (alarm blaring)

28:48.288 --> 28:50.207
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

28:50.207 --> 28:51.875
- Oh, no. Oh, my God.

28:51.875 --> 28:52.883
- Leave your bags there.

28:52.883 --> 28:54.560
Make your way down to the front, please.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.025
Leave the phone. It's not important.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.551
Customers are way more important.

28:57.551 --> 28:58.384
- I have to get that.

28:58.384 --> 28:59.265
- Leave the phone.

28:59.265 --> 29:00.831
- Alarms...
- Customers out.

29:00.831 --> 29:03.052
- It's alarm--
- Customers out.

29:03.052 --> 29:04.040
Let's go. Out.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.510
- Barry, drop what you're doing.

29:05.510 --> 29:06.890
Go off the premise, please.

29:06.890 --> 29:08.360
We're not gonna be serving this anyway.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.850
- Quick, let's go. You've got to move.

29:09.850 --> 29:10.683
Faster than that.

29:10.683 --> 29:12.347
Let's go. Everybody stand in the front.

29:12.347 --> 29:13.641
Just wait two seconds.

29:13.641 --> 29:15.670
- Is everyone out? This isn't a drill.

29:15.670 --> 29:16.860
- Oh, my god.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.690
- First of all, I just want to apologise.

29:18.690 --> 29:19.633
There's no fire.

29:21.180 --> 29:23.180
More importantly, over
the last three hours,

29:23.180 --> 29:25.137
all I've done is a bacteria test.

29:25.137 --> 29:26.928
(crowd groans)

29:26.928 --> 29:28.340
- [Crowd] Oh, my God.

29:28.340 --> 29:29.720
- I want to apologise to all of you,

29:29.720 --> 29:33.857
but I want to stop right
now what I tried endlessly

29:33.857 --> 29:36.610
to get through to the owner,
who's totally oblivious.

29:36.610 --> 29:37.593
- Is that the owner? 'Cause she's smiling.

29:37.593 --> 29:38.810
- This is the owner.

29:38.810 --> 29:39.780
- We all ate here.

29:39.780 --> 29:40.930
We were all planning on staying here,

29:40.930 --> 29:43.447
and you're smiling, like
a smirk on your face.

29:45.598 --> 29:47.920
- What I'm not gonna do
is just allow this lady

29:47.920 --> 29:51.694
to laugh at me, you guys
to pay good money and eat,

29:51.694 --> 29:53.470
and I'm certainly not
letting paying guests

29:53.470 --> 29:55.600
stay to sleep here.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.620
I'm done.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.930
My team will assist you getting
your stuff out of there.

29:58.930 --> 30:02.950
Relax, there is no fire, but
we are not gonna continue.

30:02.950 --> 30:07.190
I want to stop right now
and shut this place down.

30:07.190 --> 30:08.440
- [Crowd] Oh, my god.

30:08.440 --> 30:12.383
- I'm so sorry. I need you, now.

30:13.540 --> 30:15.046
Thank you.

30:15.046 --> 30:17.796
(dramatic music)

30:22.520 --> 30:24.073
When are you gonna get real?

30:25.690 --> 30:28.040
When are you gonna stop,
close the fucking door,

30:28.040 --> 30:30.270
and take a good look at
yourself in the mirror?

30:30.270 --> 30:32.330
- If I say anything, it's not believed.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.310
So what's the point?

30:33.310 --> 30:34.830
- What do you mean, it's not believed?

30:34.830 --> 30:36.472
What is wrong with you?

30:36.472 --> 30:37.305
- Well, I can--

30:37.305 --> 30:38.420
- What is wrong with you?

30:38.420 --> 30:39.608
- I've--

30:39.608 --> 30:40.690
- What is wrong with you?

30:40.690 --> 30:41.770
- There's nothing wrong with me.

30:41.770 --> 30:45.800
It's just, after 10 years,
I'm here every single day.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.930
They don't like me, and they insult me,

30:47.930 --> 30:51.420
and they disrespect me
every second they work here.

30:51.420 --> 30:52.710
They steal from me.

30:52.710 --> 30:55.850
They're on their cell
phones for four hours a day.

30:55.850 --> 30:59.020
- You're disrespecting
every member of staff.

30:59.020 --> 31:02.010
You're blaming everybody
for what you've created.

31:02.010 --> 31:05.270
Somewhere you switched off
and ignored all the problems

31:05.270 --> 31:07.060
and took it out on the staff.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.220
- If that's what they're telling you.

31:08.220 --> 31:09.551
- Yes, that's what they're telling me.

31:09.551 --> 31:10.384
- Okay.

31:10.384 --> 31:11.950
- Right now, I'm gonna tell you something

31:11.950 --> 31:13.500
that you've never heard before.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.610
You're out of your depth.

31:23.992 --> 31:26.659
(upbeat music)

31:28.490 --> 31:30.870
Last night, after shutting down the hotel

31:30.870 --> 31:34.060
and seeing Verindar had no
communication with employees,

31:34.060 --> 31:36.080
I organised a staff meeting.

31:36.080 --> 31:36.980
Anyone down there?

31:38.840 --> 31:41.253
But Verindar was nowhere to be found.

31:43.170 --> 31:44.227
There you are there.

31:44.227 --> 31:45.900
I've been looking for you.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.703
They said that you'd run away.

31:47.703 --> 31:49.002
- No, I'm not running away.

31:49.002 --> 31:51.464
I just don't want to be
in front of the staff.

31:51.464 --> 31:52.346
- You don't want to be
in front of the staff.

31:52.346 --> 31:53.179
- No.
- Why not?

31:53.179 --> 31:55.590
- There's no point in it.

31:55.590 --> 31:59.850
- My biggest problem is
that you have shut down,

31:59.850 --> 32:01.620
and you refuse to let anybody in.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.080
- I walk through my doors,

32:03.080 --> 32:05.480
people steal from me every single day.

32:05.480 --> 32:06.860
- And so you had some incidents

32:06.860 --> 32:08.890
with some bad staff years ago,

32:08.890 --> 32:11.560
and then you think everybody
that comes through your door

32:11.560 --> 32:13.910
is exactly the same.

32:13.910 --> 32:15.030
No, they're not.

32:15.030 --> 32:16.800
It's not about a one-on-one anymore.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.980
You can't just focus on one individual,

32:18.980 --> 32:22.530
and you've done that brilliantly
in the previous career.

32:22.530 --> 32:25.788
Running a team, managing a
hotel is completely different.

32:25.788 --> 32:26.621
- All right. Okay.

32:26.621 --> 32:28.610
- We need to get the team back on side,

32:28.610 --> 32:30.360
and they need to believe in you,

32:30.360 --> 32:32.210
and you need to believe in them.

32:32.210 --> 32:34.141
It's a two-way thing.

32:34.141 --> 32:35.860
- And it's a process too.

32:35.860 --> 32:37.450
- It is a process...
- Yeah.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.480
- But if you don't walk
back through those doors

32:39.480 --> 32:44.400
and face the music with me,
then I'm gonna go as well,

32:44.400 --> 32:46.580
because I can't do this without you.

32:46.580 --> 32:48.050
- I don't know how.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.207
- Let me show you how.

32:50.081 --> 32:52.664
(gentle music)

32:58.340 --> 33:02.173
Well, first of all, thanks for
coming in early this morning.

33:03.310 --> 33:05.090
listen. This is hard.

33:05.090 --> 33:07.123
There seems to be a massive conflict.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.850
How do we get the trust back in the room?

33:09.850 --> 33:12.123
What would you like to see change?

33:13.068 --> 33:14.030
- We just did a funeral last week,

33:14.030 --> 33:16.320
90 people, and there was two servers,

33:16.320 --> 33:18.180
zero bussers, zero bartender.

33:18.180 --> 33:20.140
- Well, of course, it's a money issue.

33:20.140 --> 33:22.410
It's a budget issue, so I took it over.

33:22.410 --> 33:23.497
And that is why.

33:23.497 --> 33:27.010
- But we had a schedule,
on Monday for the cooks.

33:27.010 --> 33:30.450
We come back Tuesday, the
schedule's completely changed.

33:30.450 --> 33:31.947
- Do you do the schedule?

33:31.947 --> 33:32.780
- Mm-hmm.

33:32.780 --> 33:33.910
- But that should be the chef's job.

33:33.910 --> 33:35.045
- Absolutely.

33:35.045 --> 33:36.380
- You need to be responsible
for your own departments.

33:36.380 --> 33:37.870
I mean like Macio's
responsible for the kitchen,

33:37.870 --> 33:39.540
Tammy's responsible for the events.

33:39.540 --> 33:42.170
You have to offload the work from you

33:42.170 --> 33:44.143
and give them the responsibility.

33:44.143 --> 33:46.320
- I guess that's a mistake.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.450
- When was the last time
you all had a meeting?

33:47.450 --> 33:49.620
- We had a servers staff meeting in here

33:49.620 --> 33:52.920
that we get yelled at,
and it just gets hostile,

33:52.920 --> 33:55.590
and people get up, me
included, and walk out...

33:55.590 --> 33:59.525
And it just doesn't help anything.

33:59.525 --> 34:00.358
- No, no, stop there.

34:00.358 --> 34:01.437
We're not, this is not a complain-fest.

34:01.437 --> 34:03.210
- But this is why no one wants to,

34:03.210 --> 34:04.850
no one ever says anything.

34:04.850 --> 34:06.511
- If you want a manager--

34:06.511 --> 34:07.601
- Because you can't get your voice out.

34:07.601 --> 34:08.434
- My vo--wait a minute.

34:08.434 --> 34:09.521
- But you must understand now

34:09.521 --> 34:11.223
that's the wrong way to handle things.

34:13.110 --> 34:15.739
There seems to be a really
bad vibe in the room

34:15.739 --> 34:17.313
that we can't shake off.

34:19.050 --> 34:20.600
- But if you want to clear the air,

34:20.600 --> 34:23.400
people need to turn their
phones off when they walk in

34:23.400 --> 34:24.914
and clock in and leave their phones...

34:24.914 --> 34:26.179
- Can I say something about the phones?

34:26.179 --> 34:27.627
- I have said that million times,

34:27.627 --> 34:29.830
"Please, do not bring
your cell phones in here."

34:29.830 --> 34:33.150
And invariably, I come in at 2 O'clock

34:33.150 --> 34:36.409
I see you guys outside
on your cell phones.

34:36.409 --> 34:37.260
That is a break.

34:37.260 --> 34:38.649
- You've never seen me on my cell phone.

34:38.649 --> 34:39.800
- No, listen to him. But
you're not listening to him.

34:39.800 --> 34:40.920
- Okay, fine.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.170
I mean, you know, maybe
you're not doing it,

34:42.170 --> 34:44.280
but other people are doing it.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.870
- Why is there so much
distrust in this building?

34:48.870 --> 34:53.870
- It's people stealing from
me, drinking on the job,

34:55.409 --> 34:57.010
doing shots over here.

34:57.010 --> 34:59.540
- That's not now. We're
talking as if it's present--

34:59.540 --> 35:01.027
- It's not happening today,

35:01.027 --> 35:01.940
yes, but there is-- I mean, you know.

35:01.940 --> 35:03.790
- But these guys aren't taking shots.

35:05.410 --> 35:06.670
But what I'm trying to say,

35:06.670 --> 35:09.983
you're accusing them of
somebody else's bad practises.

35:11.140 --> 35:15.133
What you need to stop doing
is blaming them for the past.

35:16.390 --> 35:18.063
Can you trust your team?

35:22.300 --> 35:23.133
- Yes.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.460
- Tell them that.

35:25.460 --> 35:26.760
- Okay, I'll try.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.773
- Please.

35:27.773 --> 35:29.000
- But I can't promise.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.350
- Well--
- I can only try.

35:32.328 --> 35:33.161
- Look at that smile.

35:33.161 --> 35:34.410
That'll go a long way.

35:34.410 --> 35:37.100
We all know it's not
gonna change overnight.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.490
- It's a process.

35:38.490 --> 35:40.500
- So we need to embrace that process,

35:40.500 --> 35:43.010
and we need to instil confidence.

35:43.010 --> 35:47.880
- I'm open to the change
that he wants me to follow

35:47.880 --> 35:50.480
if that's what's going to
make this place a success.

35:56.150 --> 35:57.680
- I feel like the staff meeting

35:57.680 --> 35:59.700
was a step in the right direction.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.700
Verindar seems to be coming around,

36:01.700 --> 36:04.640
but I want to make sure
she is 100% committed.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.070
Morning. Thanks so much for coming.

36:07.070 --> 36:09.560
I really need to talk to CJ privately

36:09.560 --> 36:12.663
because he's the one person who
can help get through to her.

36:17.820 --> 36:19.910
CJ, I'm gonna be honest,
I'm gonna be up-front.

36:19.910 --> 36:23.180
I'm not dealing with a hotelier.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.830
I'm dealing with your mum.

36:24.830 --> 36:28.400
And I'm sure she holds a
special place in your heart,

36:28.400 --> 36:31.860
but unfortunately, she's
running around like a dictator,

36:31.860 --> 36:34.440
and she's not letting
any of the staff breathe.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.130
She's stifling the business.

36:36.130 --> 36:38.210
- I've had conversations with her

36:38.210 --> 36:39.680
about a few things similarly.

36:39.680 --> 36:43.090
I've told her, "The way we were brought up

36:43.090 --> 36:45.010
and raised in India, that tone

36:45.010 --> 36:47.010
and conversation doesn't work here,"

36:47.010 --> 36:49.230
and, she's struggled, to be very honest,

36:49.230 --> 36:51.320
adapting to that part of it.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.600
- You adapted brilliantly,
coming to this country,

36:53.600 --> 36:55.210
but she's one tough cookie.

36:55.210 --> 36:56.210
You know that.

36:56.210 --> 36:57.268
- Yeah.

36:57.268 --> 36:58.720
- She is nitpicking the staff.

36:58.720 --> 37:01.030
And then she's not giving
any of them responsibility.

37:01.030 --> 37:04.180
She needs to be less hands on...

37:04.180 --> 37:05.013
- [CJ] Okay.

37:05.013 --> 37:05.980
- And more supportive.

37:05.980 --> 37:07.693
- Yeah, I know. I know.

37:09.340 --> 37:10.400
- This is crazy.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.950
Mid-60s, she shouldn't be
running around like this.

37:12.950 --> 37:15.440
- No. She was very
honest with me last week.

37:15.440 --> 37:18.630
She told me, "I want to spend
more time with the kids,

37:18.630 --> 37:19.670
and my time is running out,"

37:19.670 --> 37:22.120
and I haven't heard her say that ever.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.270
- Right. But she needs to let go.

37:24.270 --> 37:27.420
- Okay. So how can I help?

37:27.420 --> 37:28.700
- I need a commitment from you.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.610
Got to be there to support her.

37:30.610 --> 37:33.680
We need to get rid of that
stubbornness from your mum...

37:33.680 --> 37:36.050
And make her understand that
this business can be fruitful.

37:36.050 --> 37:37.350
She just has to step back.

37:37.350 --> 37:38.183
- [CJ] Okay.

37:38.183 --> 37:39.400
- We can't continue like this.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.970
It's do or die, and we need to step up.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.400
- Okay. All right.

37:43.400 --> 37:44.940
I'm gonna have a talk with her today.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.513
- [Gordon] Please. We get
one more shot at this.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.070
After spending time with CJ,

37:54.070 --> 37:56.480
he clearly sees the issues his mother has,

37:56.480 --> 37:58.670
and I have asked him to
reinforce the changes

37:58.670 --> 38:00.050
she needs to make.

38:00.050 --> 38:03.450
- What we should talk about
is, how do you let go?

38:03.450 --> 38:05.560
The responsibility is shifting,

38:05.560 --> 38:08.400
which means you don't
run around doing things.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.380
If it's Macio's kitchen, if
you're making that decision,

38:11.380 --> 38:13.080
it's not your problem to deal with.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.963
Let Tammy and the kitchen
chef do everything.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.060
I learned it the hard way at my job.

38:19.060 --> 38:20.670
I was working 70 hours a week, Mother.

38:20.670 --> 38:21.920
- [Verindar] Yeah, I know.

38:21.920 --> 38:26.030
- But when I got the team
in place and I stepped away,

38:26.030 --> 38:28.270
I only get involved when
there's an escalation.

38:28.270 --> 38:32.000
- Okay. All right, I mean, I can do that.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.250
- And, you know what?
Let's see what happens?

38:37.970 --> 38:39.770
- [Gordon] With Verindar
on the right track,

38:39.770 --> 38:41.330
the next order of business

38:41.330 --> 38:43.920
is starting the renovation process.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.430
The Brick Hotel needed drastic changes,

38:46.430 --> 38:48.080
so my team worked through the night

38:48.080 --> 38:50.550
to get the hotel ready for relaunch.

38:50.550 --> 38:52.890
Welcome, to the new Brick Inn.

38:52.890 --> 38:53.800
- [CJ] Wow.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.434
- [Talaya] Oh...

38:55.434 --> 38:58.488
- [Tammy] What? Oh, my God.

38:58.488 --> 38:59.321
- Wow...

39:00.619 --> 39:01.452
- [Woman] Oh, wow.

39:01.452 --> 39:02.897
- [Tammy] Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

39:02.897 --> 39:05.030
- Oh, my goodness. It's amazing.

39:09.477 --> 39:11.370
- Would you like to
come up and see my room?

39:11.370 --> 39:13.037
- [All] Yes.

39:13.037 --> 39:16.414
- [Talaya] Ho! (Laughs)

39:16.414 --> 39:17.247
- [All] Oh, wow.

39:17.247 --> 39:18.080
- [Verindar] Wow.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.210
- [Tammy] Oh, my God.

39:20.210 --> 39:21.080
- [CJ] Wow.

39:21.080 --> 39:22.854
- [Maryanne] Oh, my gosh.

39:22.854 --> 39:25.110
- I'm about to take a
nap. I'm taking a nap.

39:25.110 --> 39:27.907
I think I might have to
come check in now. No joke.

39:29.130 --> 39:33.565
Everything about these rooms are amazing.

39:33.565 --> 39:34.398
Wow.

39:34.398 --> 39:37.860
I'm excited to come to work and clean.

39:37.860 --> 39:39.463
- [Gordon] Come on,
Verindar. Jump on that bed.

39:39.463 --> 39:40.296
- [Verindar] Go ahead.

39:40.296 --> 39:41.129
- Go on. Jump in.

39:41.129 --> 39:41.962
Go on.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.155
- [Talaya] If she don't do it, I'ma do it.

39:43.155 --> 39:43.988
- Oh.

39:43.988 --> 39:44.821
- [Tammy] Oh, my goodness.

39:44.821 --> 39:46.220
- Very nice. Thank you so much.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.703
- Oh, you're welcome, Verindar.

39:47.703 --> 39:49.683
- [Talaya] Oh, yes.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.270
- [Gordon] After updating the Brick Hotel

39:53.270 --> 39:55.050
with a modern look,

39:55.050 --> 39:58.690
I gave them a classic menu
that is perfect for the town

39:58.690 --> 40:00.520
and can better accommodate catering

40:00.520 --> 40:03.320
for the large-scale events
that take place at the hotel.

40:04.375 --> 40:05.208
- Hi.

40:05.208 --> 40:06.720
- Hi, good evening.
Welcome to the Brick Hotel.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.553
- [Gordon] As for the relaunch,

40:07.553 --> 40:10.440
I invited the locals not
only to dine at the Brick...

40:10.440 --> 40:12.130
- How are the first couple
bites of everything?

40:12.130 --> 40:14.000
- Very good.
- Oh, fantastic.

40:14.000 --> 40:14.833
- They're the best scallops

40:14.833 --> 40:16.871
I've ever actually had in my life.

40:16.871 --> 40:18.875
- But to tour the
renovated rooms as well...

40:18.875 --> 40:19.870
(gasps)

40:19.870 --> 40:20.960
Mike, look at this.

40:20.960 --> 40:21.793
- Oh, wow.

40:21.793 --> 40:23.310
- Oh, my God.

40:23.310 --> 40:24.613
- Look how nice this is.

40:25.980 --> 40:26.813
- Ahh.

40:26.813 --> 40:29.870
- While on the hotel side
everything has been well received.

40:29.870 --> 40:31.970
The kitchen is running smoother than ever.

40:31.970 --> 40:34.900
Meatballs, arancini, sprouts.

40:34.900 --> 40:35.733
Yes, one at a time.

40:35.733 --> 40:36.670
- 86 brussels sprouts.

40:36.670 --> 40:38.970
- Yeah, 86 brussels sprouts, please.

40:38.970 --> 40:39.803
- 86 brussels sprouts.

40:39.803 --> 40:40.636
- That's a good sign. Thank you.

40:40.636 --> 40:41.930
And with CJ having a presence...

40:41.930 --> 40:44.005
- We ran out of brussels sprouts. Nice.

40:44.005 --> 40:44.970
- Should I go get them?

40:44.970 --> 40:46.110
- What do you mean, go get them?

40:46.110 --> 40:47.470
- [Gordon] He's able to prevent his mother

40:47.470 --> 40:49.473
from slipping back into her old habits.

40:49.473 --> 40:50.895
- It's okay. Let it go.

40:50.895 --> 40:51.802
- Do you know?

40:51.802 --> 40:53.144
- He said it's a good sign.

40:53.144 --> 40:53.977
- That is a good sign?

40:53.977 --> 40:54.840
- Yes.

40:54.840 --> 40:57.990
- Now she can focus on
her duties as an owner.

40:57.990 --> 40:59.000
- Looks fantastic.

40:59.000 --> 40:59.833
- Yeah, it looks great.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.156
- Well, thank you. Thank you.

41:01.156 --> 41:03.642
- They did a great job.

41:03.642 --> 41:04.475
- Customers are happy?

41:04.475 --> 41:05.308
- Yes.

41:05.308 --> 41:07.617
- First of all, it's so
nice to see you smile.

41:07.617 --> 41:08.450
- Yes.

41:08.450 --> 41:10.160
- You have to walk around this
town with your head up high.

41:10.160 --> 41:14.440
- Well, I apologise for the
difficulty I gave you initially.

41:14.440 --> 41:17.540
- Okay, and the only thing
I want to see you do is,

41:17.540 --> 41:18.500
from time to time,

41:18.500 --> 41:21.690
come in here and walk around
like you did all night tonight,

41:21.690 --> 41:22.870
with charm and grace.

41:22.870 --> 41:23.703
- Okay.

41:23.703 --> 41:26.750
- I've told them that you are
banned from behind that line.

41:26.750 --> 41:27.750
Okay, good.

41:27.750 --> 41:30.900
- All right, I promise you
all this stuff will happen.

41:30.900 --> 41:31.733
- Promise me?

41:31.733 --> 41:32.950
- Yes.

41:32.950 --> 41:33.783
- Pinky promise.

41:33.783 --> 41:34.616
- Pinky promise.

41:34.616 --> 41:37.070
- I'm not a person who expresses joy

41:37.070 --> 41:40.760
or in a jumping up and
down, and things like that,

41:40.760 --> 41:43.070
but really, really wonderful.

41:43.070 --> 41:47.320
It's given us a lot of
oxygen for a second life.

41:47.320 --> 41:48.650
- Best wishes. Take care.

41:48.650 --> 41:50.030
- Bye.
- Thank you.

41:52.831 --> 41:54.998
(exhales)

41:56.400 --> 41:57.907
Wow, what a week.

42:02.182 --> 42:03.060
After leaving the Brick,

42:03.060 --> 42:06.130
the reputation of the
hotel was on the mend.

42:06.130 --> 42:08.610
CJ became a more visible owner,

42:08.610 --> 42:12.500
and Verindar stayed true to
her word in trusting her staff

42:12.500 --> 42:15.460
to do their jobs, and
her employee turnover

42:15.460 --> 42:17.350
is at an all-time low.

42:17.350 --> 42:18.890
With these changes in place,

42:18.890 --> 42:22.373
the Brick is well on its way
to being what it once was.

42:57.238 --> 43:00.405
- [Voice over] One Potato, Two Potato.
