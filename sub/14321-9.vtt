00:01.750 --> 00:03.000
[narrator]
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.708
[Cable]
He's in the pyramid,

00:04.708 --> 00:07.875
forcing life through
those decaying veins of his.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.875
[Apocalypse]
Your attack was foreseen.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.166
I allowed you to get this far

00:12.166 --> 00:15.333
so I might gain
the one great power I lack,

00:15.333 --> 00:18.583
a passport
to the dimension of time.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.708
[Shard]
Forge, what is it?

00:20.708 --> 00:22.333
[Forge] There is
a massive impediment

00:22.333 --> 00:23.583
in the time stream.

00:23.583 --> 00:24.583
[Shard]
Bishop!

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Call me Bender, so few do.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.625
But that's because you're
the only other one here.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.500
But how did I get here?

00:31.500 --> 00:33.375
Through the Axis, how else?

00:33.375 --> 00:35.375
All time travelers
pass through there.

00:35.375 --> 00:36.958
[chuckles mockingly]
Anyone knows that.

00:36.958 --> 00:38.583
[screaming]

00:38.583 --> 00:41.208
[Jubilee] The Nasty Boys
got Jean and Cyclops!

00:41.208 --> 00:42.291
That means...

00:42.291 --> 00:43.875
[Xavier]
Sinister!

00:43.875 --> 00:45.958
[Sinister]
I missed the wedding.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.500
I'm hurt.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.958
Get away from him!

00:48.958 --> 00:51.458
Who dares defy me?

00:51.458 --> 00:53.875
A friend of Charles Xavier's.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.125
Drop him!

00:57.125 --> 00:58.458
No chance.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.208
[Beast] Despite his newfound
time travel abilities,

01:02.208 --> 01:04.291
I believe Mr. Sinister
is caught between

01:04.291 --> 01:06.458
the proverbial rock
and a hard place.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.750
What have you done
with my wife?

01:08.750 --> 01:10.416
Mrs. Summers

01:10.416 --> 01:13.083
is just another
broken blossom

01:13.083 --> 01:15.958
floating through
the winds of time.

01:15.958 --> 01:17.458
[Rogue]
Oh, no, you don't!

01:18.208 --> 01:21.250
They've taken Jean to the
one place you can't get to.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.416
Another time.

01:25.375 --> 01:28.375
[theme music playing]

02:36.291 --> 02:39.083
[explosions]

02:40.458 --> 02:41.583
Renegade ships!

02:42.250 --> 02:44.333
Warn the Empress!
We're under attack!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.375
[Deathbird]
The wall is breached!

03:14.375 --> 03:16.625
The palace will soon be mine!

03:28.583 --> 03:30.375
I know already, Oracle.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.333
We must prepare
for the worst.

03:42.250 --> 03:45.833
Sister, has your jealous
ambition so blinded you?

03:45.833 --> 03:48.166
The throne should
have been mine!

03:48.166 --> 03:49.416
Now it shall be.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.125
You'll have to deal
with me first, Princess.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.083
Keep Gladiator busy!

03:55.083 --> 03:56.583
I'll deal with Lilandra.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.125
[screaming]

04:04.750 --> 04:07.291
As leader of
the Praetorian Guard,

04:07.291 --> 04:09.583
I cannot allow you
to harm the Empress!

04:09.583 --> 04:12.708
Then I give you my solemn vow,
I will not.

04:12.708 --> 04:15.166
But I do not speak for him.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.708
What manner of being
is this?

04:23.708 --> 04:27.833
Get rid of her, Apocalypse,
as you promised!

04:27.833 --> 04:29.708
[Lilandra grunting]

04:29.708 --> 04:33.458
Prepare to serve
your new Empress, Gladiator!

04:33.458 --> 04:36.291
Let her go,
if you wish to live!

04:36.291 --> 04:39.875
What are you waiting for?
Eliminate her!

04:39.875 --> 04:41.708
In time.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.625
Are you all right,
my Empress?

04:46.625 --> 04:49.500
Stop him! If he
did not come for me...

04:51.000 --> 04:53.375
Not her! The Empress!

04:53.375 --> 04:55.875
You promised
to destroy Lilandra!

04:55.875 --> 04:57.500
I lied.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.083
Farewell, Empress.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.291
[evil laughter]

05:04.875 --> 05:08.166
I shall not be denied!

05:08.166 --> 05:10.875
It is useless to continue
your treachery, Princess.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.583
You have failed.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.583
Traitors! Ingrates!

05:14.583 --> 05:17.333
You cannot deny me my crown!

05:17.333 --> 05:21.416
You should choose your allies
more carefully, my sister.

05:23.708 --> 05:26.083
I can't stop thinking
about it, Professor.

05:26.583 --> 05:29.416
Jean and I were both in the car
when the blast hit.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.416
Sinister's always wanted
both of us.

05:31.416 --> 05:34.208
Why was she taken
and I left behind?

05:34.208 --> 05:36.958
I have been wondering
the same thing, Scott.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.958
I don't need
my psychic abilities

05:38.958 --> 05:40.875
to know that
you wish it had been you.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.000
What?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.458
Professor! What is it?

05:43.458 --> 05:45.000
Lilandra!

05:45.000 --> 05:47.250
I bring you a warning,
Charles Xavier.

05:47.250 --> 05:48.875
An earth creature,
Apocalypse,

05:48.875 --> 05:51.583
has taken one of
my psychics named Oracle.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.583
I do not know
why he has appeared here.

05:53.583 --> 05:56.000
But I knew
I must contact you.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.875
-Be warned.
-What did she say?

05:58.500 --> 06:00.291
Assemble the X-Men.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.000
Sinister!

06:24.000 --> 06:26.208
Why are you
helping Apocalypse?

06:26.208 --> 06:29.333
He can give me
what I've always wanted.

06:29.333 --> 06:33.375
The chance to create
a new breed of human beings,

06:33.375 --> 06:36.000
ones that I will
personally select

06:36.000 --> 06:38.375
and genetically engineer.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.458
But that would take generations.

06:40.458 --> 06:42.583
Apocalypse may be immortal,
but you're not.

06:42.583 --> 06:45.958
From here, I can exist
in all times!

06:45.958 --> 06:47.833
Even as I begin
the experiment,

06:47.833 --> 06:52.000
I can leap through a portal
and see its result.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.833
And where is here?

06:55.500 --> 06:59.375
Allow me to answer
your question.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.500
Here is the Axis of Time,

07:02.500 --> 07:04.583
where all times cross,

07:04.583 --> 07:07.000
and where you
will always remain,

07:07.000 --> 07:08.750
Jean Grey.

07:09.708 --> 07:12.083
When I first attempted
time travel,

07:12.083 --> 07:14.458
fate, in its infinite wisdom,

07:14.458 --> 07:16.833
threw me off course
into this,

07:16.833 --> 07:20.208
the temporal control center
of existence.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.125
It has taken me centuries
of searching

07:24.125 --> 07:27.208
to discover its many powers.

07:27.208 --> 07:31.708
But working here,
outside of time,

07:31.708 --> 07:34.375
those centuries,
in your time,

07:34.375 --> 07:37.708
have been merely
the blink of an eye.

07:37.708 --> 07:41.166
If you have become so powerful,
why do you need us?

07:41.166 --> 07:44.458
All in due time.

07:44.458 --> 07:47.500
[evil laughter]

08:06.000 --> 08:08.083
[Xavier] A communication
from Lilandra

08:08.083 --> 08:11.083
has given me a clue
as to why Jean was taken.

08:11.083 --> 08:14.125
Mr. Sinister tried
to capture both of us.

08:14.125 --> 08:17.291
Luckily for me, he encountered
some unexpected resistance.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.583
Now Apocalypse has taken

08:19.583 --> 08:21.708
the Shi'ar courtier
known as Oracle.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.166
Sound like Sinister
and Apocalypse working

08:24.166 --> 08:25.708
the same side of the street.

08:25.708 --> 08:28.708
Each of us possess
intense psychic power.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.458
I am certain
they will strike again.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.458
We'll use Cerebro
to track down

08:33.458 --> 08:35.500
other mutants
with psychic powers.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.583
And we'll be there when
Apocalypse or Sinister strikes.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.375
You are not suggesting
using them as bait.

08:41.375 --> 08:42.875
We have to.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.708
Warning them
could reveal our plan.

08:44.708 --> 08:48.708
Hey, if they be psychic,
they already know, right?

08:48.708 --> 08:50.875
That is not funny, Gambit.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.125
You cannot endanger
innocent people

08:53.125 --> 08:54.458
just to save Jean!

08:54.458 --> 08:56.291
This isn't about Jean!

08:56.291 --> 08:57.875
[Xavier]
Cyclops is right.

08:57.875 --> 09:00.958
If Apocalypse and Sinister
have joined forces,

09:00.958 --> 09:03.166
and are able
to instantaneously travel

09:03.166 --> 09:04.708
in time and space,

09:04.708 --> 09:07.000
all existence is in danger.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
You got that right.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.125
I don't know how,
but I believe

09:10.125 --> 09:12.000
my brother's life
is at stake in all this.

09:35.958 --> 09:37.458
[growling]

09:39.125 --> 09:40.291
[barking]

09:43.458 --> 09:44.833
[Psylocke]
Nice doggie.

09:45.458 --> 09:46.708
-Nap time.
-[dog whining]

10:04.875 --> 10:06.708
I should have brought
a shopping cart.

10:06.708 --> 10:07.708
Oh, well.

10:11.458 --> 10:14.375
A discus from
the first Olympic games.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.083
Should be worth
a few pennies.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.708
[Archangel]
A ninja sports fan.

10:17.708 --> 10:19.750
I keep my baseball cards
in my...

10:19.750 --> 10:21.083
[grunts]

10:22.833 --> 10:25.291
Okay, that was two mistakes.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.708
Mine and yours!

10:28.875 --> 10:32.375
You're not a common thief.
What are you really after?

10:32.375 --> 10:35.375
I owe no explanations
to the likes of you, traitor!

10:53.125 --> 10:54.458
Agile.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.583
I wonder what she looks like
under that mask.

11:04.708 --> 11:07.250
Nowhere to hide?
What a shame.

11:11.625 --> 11:12.625
No!

11:16.875 --> 11:18.000
[grunts]

11:23.333 --> 11:26.125
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I think.

11:27.583 --> 11:28.833
Thanks to you.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.458
Watch that first step.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.583
[grunts]

11:33.583 --> 11:35.708
Pleasant dreams,
Warren Worthington.

11:35.708 --> 11:38.333
I knew you wouldn't
let me die.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.458
Fool.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.083
-[Wolverine] Anything?
-No.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.708
I think your computer got
its zip codes scrambled.

11:51.708 --> 11:54.208
If Bishop told you
anything about us,

11:54.208 --> 11:57.208
you'd know Cerebro
don't make mistakes.

11:57.208 --> 11:58.750
If you happen
to see a beautiful,

11:58.750 --> 12:00.583
black-haired mutant psychic,

12:00.583 --> 12:01.583
wake me up.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.000
Don't get too comfortable.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.208
Ugh!

12:14.208 --> 12:17.416
That's the last time
I save a falling ninja.

12:17.958 --> 12:19.416
What's this?

12:19.416 --> 12:21.583
Looks like my raven-haired
sneak thief

12:21.583 --> 12:23.750
has decided to extend
her shopping spree.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.375
Let's see where
the night takes us.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.125
[tires squealing]

12:39.583 --> 12:42.333
Hey, go easy
on those tires.

12:47.416 --> 12:49.875
Heard it coming.
I'll take a closer look.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.708
When something blows up,
come running.

12:58.583 --> 12:59.708
Not bad,

12:59.708 --> 13:01.416
for a hairy old man.

13:02.958 --> 13:05.375
I know him. Archangel.

13:05.375 --> 13:07.083
Destined to join the X-Men.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.875
But whose side
is he on now?

13:09.958 --> 13:12.583
Professor, this is Shard.
Something's up.

13:14.583 --> 13:17.458
Archangel.
Why is he there?

13:17.458 --> 13:20.083
I'm putting Gambit
and Storm on alert.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.500
If there is trouble,
I will pull them

13:21.500 --> 13:23.000
off their stakeout to help.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.000
You've been
a busy little ninja.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.166
Worthington!

13:33.500 --> 13:36.500
Careful, I have a fondness
for the 17th century.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.208
I could've called the police,

13:38.208 --> 13:40.375
but I wanted to give
a fellow mutant the chance

13:40.375 --> 13:41.958
to explain herself.

13:41.958 --> 13:45.333
What do you care about
your fellow mutants?

13:45.333 --> 13:48.708
You use your wealth
to deny your mutant heritage.

13:48.708 --> 13:51.166
You had a scientist
try to cure you,

13:51.166 --> 13:53.708
and you waste your life
hunting a creature

13:53.708 --> 13:55.083
who can never die.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.333
My money is none
of your concern.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.250
You brood over
your own troubles

13:59.250 --> 14:01.166
when you could be using
your wealth and power

14:01.166 --> 14:02.583
for so much more.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.958
Noble sentiments
coming from a thief.

14:04.958 --> 14:07.250
Or is all this
for a charity bazaar?

14:07.250 --> 14:09.708
It's for my brother

14:09.708 --> 14:12.833
who fights for the good
of mutants, all mutants!

14:12.833 --> 14:15.875
A thief with a cause
is still a thief!

14:15.875 --> 14:17.250
[yells]

14:17.250 --> 14:19.333
No knife in the back
this time!

14:21.875 --> 14:23.166
[groans]

14:31.583 --> 14:32.625
Wolverine?

14:33.583 --> 14:35.125
Guess again!

14:36.125 --> 14:37.958
You get the woman, Sabretooth.

14:37.958 --> 14:40.000
I'll deal with
the winged wonder.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.458
You get all the fun, Mystique!

14:46.583 --> 14:47.708
Think again, honey!

14:51.000 --> 14:53.208
Oh, man!

14:53.208 --> 14:55.708
Was that ever
the wrong thing to do!

14:57.708 --> 14:59.416
Looks like
the kidnappers union

14:59.416 --> 15:01.208
will let anything in.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.875
I'm collecting dues.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.958
Thought you'd have learned
to watch your back.

15:06.958 --> 15:10.458
Yeah, I keep underestimating
the fairer sex.

15:13.166 --> 15:15.375
Sure hope this stuff
is insured.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.875
[screaming]

15:17.875 --> 15:20.583
Okay, I'm through
playing around!

15:20.583 --> 15:23.458
Ooh! What're you gonna do?

15:23.458 --> 15:25.000
Eat your spinach?

15:25.833 --> 15:28.583
Let's see what you had
for breakfast.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.708
Get off him!
[groans]

15:30.708 --> 15:33.083
Watch your own back, dearie.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.500
[screaming]

15:35.500 --> 15:36.833
[Sabretooth]
Goodbye, runt!

15:36.833 --> 15:38.833
[groaning]

15:38.833 --> 15:43.000
Oh, man.
Brush sometimes, will ya?

15:44.500 --> 15:46.166
[groans]

15:46.166 --> 15:49.333
Now, where's my favorite
new psychic?

15:49.333 --> 15:51.583
Hurry! It's you they're after!

15:51.583 --> 15:54.458
[Shard] Get back!
Mystique is a shape-shifter!

15:54.458 --> 15:56.708
She's taken on my shape
to fool you!

15:58.833 --> 16:01.291
Nice trick,
but it's wasted

16:01.291 --> 16:02.708
on a psychic.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.208
And on this nose.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.375
Blasted bloodhound!

16:11.083 --> 16:12.750
I don't know how
any of you know me

16:12.750 --> 16:13.833
or what you want,

16:13.833 --> 16:15.375
but I'm out of here!

16:15.375 --> 16:17.125
So just back off!

16:17.125 --> 16:18.500
[Magneto]
May I help?

16:19.333 --> 16:20.583
Magneto!

16:21.166 --> 16:22.583
How about a lift?

16:27.250 --> 16:30.750
What is this,
a science fiction convention?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.875
I see I must persuade you.

16:41.833 --> 16:43.166
[groaning]

16:43.166 --> 16:45.333
What do you want
with me?

16:45.333 --> 16:47.000
Don't worry.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.583
No harm will come to you...

16:48.583 --> 16:49.583
yet.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.458
[Wolverine yelling]

16:51.458 --> 16:52.458
[Psylocke grunts]

16:53.583 --> 16:55.208
Wolverine!

17:02.708 --> 17:05.375
[screaming]

17:07.083 --> 17:10.500
A memento for my friends,
the X-Men.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.208
Don't think
I've forgotten you.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.458
-The portal!
-[Magneto] Grab on!

17:33.333 --> 17:35.708
Wolverine! Wolverine!

17:36.500 --> 17:38.375
[Gambit] Look like
we arrive too late, chere.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.583
What happened?
Where are the others?

17:40.583 --> 17:42.875
We messed up.
Psylocke's gone.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.208
Wolverine's inside.

17:46.458 --> 17:49.833
Whirlwind, heed my command!

18:00.333 --> 18:01.875
How nice to see you, Logan.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.166
All tied up
and nowhere to go.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.458
Just get me out of here.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.458
Every mutant on earth seems
to be in on this thing!

18:17.291 --> 18:18.875
Archangel!

18:18.875 --> 18:20.708
-[Shard] Is he...
-He is unhurt.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.958
I bet this clown knows
what's going on.

18:23.958 --> 18:26.583
Maybe if I give
the chain a squeeze.

18:31.708 --> 18:33.000
[Mystique] It's fortunate
you came along

18:33.000 --> 18:34.625
when you did, Magneto.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.416
We weren't expecting
interference from the X-Men.

18:37.416 --> 18:40.250
Apocalypse was monitoring
your mission.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.875
It was he who summoned me.

18:41.875 --> 18:44.083
Too bad we lost Sabretooth.

18:44.083 --> 18:47.083
Sabretooth is
an unthinking animal.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.625
Such refuse
is easily expendable.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.875
[APOCALYPSE] Your lack
of sentimentality is refreshing.

18:52.875 --> 18:56.125
You make
a worthy partner, Magneto.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.708
You know my price.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.500
Resurrections
are delicate procedures.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.750
When all the psychics
are in place,

19:06.750 --> 19:09.416
you shall see
your beloved wife.

19:17.958 --> 19:21.166
You had no trouble
obtaining this one?

19:21.166 --> 19:24.458
He was being watched
by the X-Men Storm and Gambit.

19:24.458 --> 19:28.708
But they inexplicably
abandoned their posts.

19:28.708 --> 19:31.833
It seems that Charles Xavier
has deduced

19:31.833 --> 19:33.250
the pattern of my plan.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.625
All the better

19:35.625 --> 19:39.625
as he will be my final prize.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.375
I wanted to nail Apocalypse

19:46.375 --> 19:48.500
by destroying
his Lazarus Chamber.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.458
But now that that scum has
my time travel band,

19:54.708 --> 19:56.708
it's gonna be
a whole lot tougher.

19:56.708 --> 19:58.458
He can just go back
to the past

19:58.458 --> 20:00.208
before we blasted the chamber

20:00.208 --> 20:02.000
and rejuvenate himself again.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.708
Our only hope
is to go so far back

20:05.708 --> 20:08.083
that we get rid of the chamber
at its point of origin.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.583
But, Dad,
that's impossible.

20:10.583 --> 20:13.625
You know time travel devices
were judged too dangerous.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.750
They destroyed them all.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.375
And they would have nailed you
if they'd known you had one.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.458
Remember your
history lessons, Tyler.

20:23.500 --> 20:27.458
Nuclear disarmament,
back in the 21st century.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.375
Every government kept
one bomb...

20:30.458 --> 20:31.875
just in case.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.125
The government still has
a time machine?

20:34.125 --> 20:36.875
Yeah, but they aren't
letting anybody get near it.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.000
It's in there.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.708
And we're gonna borrow it.

20:52.708 --> 20:55.708
