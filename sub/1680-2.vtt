WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:01.260
different, not different?
married--

00:02.400 --> 00:05.000
it's the same. mostly.

00:05.060 --> 00:06.860
except i think i might
be getting carpal tunnel.

00:06.930 --> 00:08.800
my hand keeps
cramping up.

00:08.860 --> 00:10.660
i thought the whole point
of getting married was

00:10.730 --> 00:12.360
that you didn't have
to do that anymore.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.900
no, it's from writing
all the thank you notes.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.900
mostly.
yeah.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.700
you're writing
constantly.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.700
there's forms we
have to sign,

00:20.760 --> 00:21.730
our death folders,

00:21.800 --> 00:22.830
thank you notes.
whoa, whoa.

00:22.900 --> 00:25.160
what are death folders?

00:25.230 --> 00:26.600
it's this thing they
recommend you do

00:26.660 --> 00:28.460
in case one spouse
dies unexpectedly.

00:28.530 --> 00:29.660
it's all
the information

00:29.730 --> 00:30.800
your spouse might need

00:30.860 --> 00:32.500
all in one convenient
location.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.630
lily:
yeah.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.600
account info,
important addresses,

00:35.660 --> 00:37.260
a letter to the
other person.

00:37.330 --> 00:38.330
all that stuff.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.500
i'll get the next round.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.500
thanks.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.930
i am such a jerk.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.130
yeah.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.660
wait, why?

00:46.730 --> 00:48.660
i didn't know that i was
supposed to write a letter.

00:48.730 --> 00:50.030
all lily's gonna find

00:50.100 --> 00:51.530
in that folder are a bunch
of bank statements

00:51.600 --> 00:53.500
and a funny list of things to do
with my ashes.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.360
marshall brownies.

00:54.430 --> 00:55.500
number six.
yeah.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.830
oh, god, i am a bad husband.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.830
no, uh, no, i'll just write,

00:59.900 --> 01:01.860
i'll write lily a letter
tonight, everything'll be fine.

01:01.930 --> 01:03.000
that's right.

01:03.060 --> 01:04.760
unless...

01:04.830 --> 01:07.130
you die between
now and then.
ooh.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.430
but...

01:08.500 --> 01:09.800
come on, that's never
gonna happen.
yes!

01:09.860 --> 01:11.300
if there's one thing
we can state

01:11.360 --> 01:12.800
with absolute certainty

01:12.860 --> 01:15.300
it's that marshall eriksen
is not going to die

01:15.360 --> 01:16.360
before writing
that letter.

01:16.430 --> 01:17.900
barney:
no way at all.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.700
in fact, i dare god

01:20.760 --> 01:22.700
to smite down this
perfectly healthy...

01:22.760 --> 01:23.930
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.530
i get it.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.200
okay, you guys know
i'm a little superstitious,

01:27.260 --> 01:28.800
and you guys are trying
to freak me out.

01:28.860 --> 01:30.230
well, guess what?
it didn't work.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.400

02:01.300 --> 02:03.830

her normal life,</i>

02:03.900 --> 02:06.430

her normal self.</i>

02:06.500 --> 02:09.430
i was just so uptight
in new york, you know?

02:09.500 --> 02:12.430
i mean down here everybody
shares everything.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.100
it's like we're all one big
shimmering ball

02:16.160 --> 02:18.100
of positive energy.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.800
i wonder if anyone's ever
thought that before.

02:21.860 --> 02:22.960
here.

02:23.030 --> 02:24.700
eat.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.030
if we run out of fish,

02:26.100 --> 02:27.760
i will catch more
with my hands.

02:27.830 --> 02:29.530
(drums playing)

02:29.600 --> 02:31.200
a drum circle!

02:31.260 --> 02:32.300
they're different
every time.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.630
let's go watch!

02:34.700 --> 02:36.530
and here i am
at the drum circle.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.000
whoa, are you topless?

02:38.060 --> 02:39.160
ted, check this out.

02:39.230 --> 02:40.660
seen 'em.

02:40.730 --> 02:42.460
wow, it seems
like a great trip.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.760
oh, it was.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.130
i feel like
the robin who left

02:46.200 --> 02:48.660
is not the same robin
who came back, you know.

02:48.730 --> 02:51.500
wow, there's a lot
of nude people in here.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.630
you haven't changed,
scherbatsky.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.800
you're a sophisticated,
scotch-swilling,

02:55.860 --> 02:57.730
cigar-smoking,
red-meat-eating,

02:57.800 --> 02:59.230
gun-toting new yorker.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.800
just shoes
and a shirt.

03:00.860 --> 03:02.200
that's a look.

03:02.260 --> 03:04.200
what you are not is
a massage-giving,

03:04.260 --> 03:05.900
windsurfing,
bongo-playing,

03:05.960 --> 03:08.060
teetotaling, vegan,
peacenik, hippy

03:08.130 --> 03:09.900
like you soon to be
ex-boyfriend, gael.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.300
back me up here, ted.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.900
i'm just happy
robin's happy.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.300
thank you.
lily:
man,

03:15.360 --> 03:16.630
this is like a
"where's waldo"

03:16.700 --> 03:18.100
of exposed genitalia.

03:18.160 --> 03:22.330
except that it's really
easy to find waldo.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.430
i'm evolved...

03:23.500 --> 03:24.730
and i'm enjoying
living my life

03:24.800 --> 03:26.360
a little bit closer
to the way gael

03:26.430 --> 03:28.360
and i did
in argentina.
please.

03:28.430 --> 03:31.530
vacation romances have
an expiration date.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.660
gael's got a "best if
banged by" sticker on him.

03:34.730 --> 03:35.900
once your romance

03:35.960 --> 03:38.000
starts to stink,
you'll dump his ass

03:38.060 --> 03:39.660
down the drain
like sour milk

03:39.730 --> 03:41.660
and go back to being
"unevolved robin,"

03:41.730 --> 03:43.230
the one we actually like.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.560
back me up here, ted.

03:44.630 --> 03:47.330
i'm just happy
robin's happy.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.330
i'm telling you,
within three days...

03:49.400 --> 03:50.560
ooh, here he comes.
switched to big words.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.760
within a triad
of solar periods,

03:53.830 --> 03:55.400
you'll recognize your dearth

03:55.460 --> 03:57.330
of compatibility
with your paramour

03:57.400 --> 03:59.530
and conclude your association.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.760
my journey
was transformative.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.030
and i reassert
my commitment

04:02.100 --> 04:03.860
to both
the aforementioned paramour

04:03.930 --> 04:06.030
and the philosophies
he espouses.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.360
what are we
talking of?

04:07.430 --> 04:09.060
baseball?

04:09.130 --> 04:12.230
this is all gonna return to
masticate you in the gluteals.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.100
support my hypothesis, ted.

04:15.160 --> 04:18.600
i'm just jubilant my former
paramour's jubilant.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.360
to write the letter

04:25.430 --> 04:27.530
<i>he hoped lily would never have
to read.</i>

04:27.600 --> 04:31.530
"my dearest,
sweetest, lily pad.

circumstances,

"then beware.

05:03.830 --> 05:06.760
"especially not ted."

05:52.860 --> 05:54.300
my windsurfing board...

05:54.360 --> 05:56.030
it had floated away.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.700
and the shark...

05:57.760 --> 06:00.300
he was getting closer.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.630
they say to escape

06:01.700 --> 06:03.130
you punch a shark
in the nose.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.400
but i said,

06:04.460 --> 06:05.930
"brother shark,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.600

06:09.730 --> 06:11.130

06:11.200 --> 06:13.160
and that's all i remember
until the hospital.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.230
that guy.
yeah.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.230
that guy.

06:18.300 --> 06:19.730
look at how easy
he has it.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.900
you and me, we have
to bend over backwards

06:21.960 --> 06:25.230
to get a woman to, well,
bend over backwards.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.260
but that guy...

06:27.330 --> 06:29.260
every woman in the bar
is hanging

06:29.330 --> 06:31.930
on his every slightly
mispronounced word.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.760
and why?

06:33.830 --> 06:35.760
he's better
looking than us.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.200
no.

06:37.260 --> 06:38.860
because he's from
out of town.

06:38.930 --> 06:40.100
mmm.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.000
with and accent
and an innocent smile,

06:42.060 --> 06:44.000
you don't even
have to try.
yeah.

06:44.060 --> 06:45.300
plus automatic out,

06:45.360 --> 06:46.560
you're leaving in
a couple of days.

06:46.630 --> 06:49.230
god, i wish we
were tourists.
yeah.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.360
actually...

06:52.430 --> 06:54.900
you know where i've been
meaning to visit?

06:56.930 --> 06:58.800
(camera shutter clicking)
okay, okay, we're
from a small town

06:58.860 --> 06:59.900
in the south
of france.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.930
our plane leaves
sunday morning.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.530
(with southern accent):
uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.560
hate to bother you.

07:05.630 --> 07:06.900
we seem to be
a little bit lost.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.130
would you happen to know
which street

07:08.200 --> 07:09.700
the statue
of liberty's on?

07:09.760 --> 07:12.460
actually,
it's on its own island.

07:12.530 --> 07:14.260
oh!
oh, it's right...

07:14.330 --> 07:16.200
ah.
thank you very...

07:16.260 --> 07:19.760
uh, my name is, uh,
ignatius peabody nobel.

07:19.830 --> 07:22.700
from east westerton,
missouri.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.860
and this is
my friend, ted.

07:25.930 --> 07:27.260
hi, um, i'm colleen.

07:27.330 --> 07:28.430
hi, colleen.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.900
hi, lindsay.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.230
so, hey,

07:31.300 --> 07:33.100
you-you-you ladies,

07:33.160 --> 07:34.130
what do you say...

07:34.200 --> 07:35.600
ah, never mind.
no...

07:35.660 --> 07:36.400
no, what is it?

07:36.460 --> 07:37.830
well...

07:37.900 --> 07:39.230
it's just we're leaving
sunday morning.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.800
it sure would be nice to
have some real new yorkers

07:40.860 --> 07:42.230
show us around.
yeah.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.560
well, we're busy
tonight, but...

07:45.630 --> 07:47.130
maybe tomorrow
afternoon?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.230
after lunch?

07:48.300 --> 07:49.730
well, hotdog!

07:49.800 --> 07:50.900
should we...

07:50.960 --> 07:52.030
you want to just
meet here

07:52.100 --> 07:54.230
in front of mac...
maclaren's pub?

07:54.300 --> 07:56.060
it's kind of a
lame bar, but sure.

07:56.130 --> 07:57.930
really? it doesn't
seem that lame to me.

07:58.000 --> 07:58.830
it's pretty lame.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.900
i think it's cool.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.500
we'll see you
tomorrow.
barney:
all right.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.300
i'm just saying it seems like
a kind of bar

08:04.360 --> 08:05.660
a lot of cool people
would ng out at.

08:05.730 --> 08:06.700
okay, all right.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.200
so, gael, huh?
mmm.

08:08.260 --> 08:09.460
still going strong?

08:09.530 --> 08:10.960
yeah, it's great.

08:11.030 --> 08:13.760
amazing, fantastic, awesome.

08:13.830 --> 08:14.860
ooh, that's one too many.

08:14.930 --> 08:15.930
what's going on?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.800
well, now that i'm home,

08:17.860 --> 08:19.000
i'm finding myself
getting annoyed

08:19.060 --> 08:21.260
at things that i loved
on vacation.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.930
here, taste.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.960
experience your food.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.930
oh.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.930
so good.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.660
here, taste.

08:31.730 --> 08:33.330
experience your food.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.200
ooh, sofa,
ooh, sofa.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.630
sofa, sofa, oh.

08:36.700 --> 08:37.799
(grunts)

08:37.860 --> 08:39.830
ooh.
we're alone now.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.860
i must have you.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.830
(laughs)

08:44.900 --> 08:46.360
(moans)

08:46.430 --> 08:48.000
ooh.
i must have you.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.100
laptop, laptop, laptop!

08:50.160 --> 08:52.560
(sighs)

08:52.630 --> 08:53.830
and you know
what else?

08:53.900 --> 08:55.560
i'm still finding sand
everywhere.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.660
i mean, we haven't been
to the beach since argentina.

08:57.730 --> 08:59.330
where is all coming from?

08:59.400 --> 09:01.330
well, maybe you're just
going back

09:01.400 --> 09:03.330
to the person you were
before the trip.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.560
but i don't want to.

09:04.630 --> 09:06.560
i was so happy down there.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.900
no, you know what?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.230
i'm done complaining.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.860
i'm evolving.

09:10.930 --> 09:12.130
just gonna

09:12.200 --> 09:14.200
go with the flow.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.130
wow.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.930
gael, you're peeing
while i'm in the shower.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.930
okay.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.600
<i>okay, old robin would have been
like, dude, ocupado.</i>

09:27.660 --> 09:30.600
but now, you know what,
i'm cool with it.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.260
pee it up.

09:32.330 --> 09:33.960
in fact,

09:34.030 --> 09:36.200
when you're done, why don't you
come in here and join me?

09:36.260 --> 09:38.700
don't mind if i do, love.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.330
(screams)

09:40.400 --> 09:42.860
gael, there's some weird du...

09:42.930 --> 09:44.200
hello.
hey!

09:44.260 --> 09:45.530
good news!

09:45.600 --> 09:47.060
i made some new traveling
friends today,

09:47.130 --> 09:49.200
and they'll be staying with us,
how do you say...

09:49.260 --> 09:50.860
indefinitely!

09:50.930 --> 09:52.460
all:
g'day!

09:56.530 --> 09:58.460
bp
ooh, here.

09:58.530 --> 09:59.830
will you sign
this thank you note?

10:02.760 --> 10:03.700
wow.

10:03.760 --> 10:04.700
both sides.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.130
you wrote on

10:06.200 --> 10:09.500
both sides of a thank you note
to my third cousin

10:09.560 --> 10:11.960
for a blender that you haven't
even taken out of the box.

10:12.030 --> 10:13.430
wow, that's...

10:13.500 --> 10:15.100
it's a really nice blender.
well, if you love

10:15.160 --> 10:16.500
that blender so much,
why don't you just marry it.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.860
i can't.
i married you.

10:18.930 --> 10:20.500
that's how we go the blender.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.460
what's wrong?

10:22.530 --> 10:24.000
nothing.

10:24.060 --> 10:25.230
nothing's wrong.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.560
what could be wrong?

10:26.630 --> 10:28.730
except that when you die
i'm gonna find out

10:28.800 --> 10:30.830
that your parting words
to comfort me for all eternity

10:30.900 --> 10:32.160
<i>were "cancel vogue."</i>

10:32.230 --> 10:34.430
how can you
open my letter?

10:34.500 --> 10:35.730
that was not a letter.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.160
it was barely even
a text message.

10:37.230 --> 10:38.730
next time you
write something

10:38.800 --> 10:40.330
that short, at least have
the courtesy to make it rhyme.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.600
marshall, wait.

10:43.660 --> 10:46.430
this was our first fight
as a married couple.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.560
oh, baby.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.630
oh...
oh.

10:52.230 --> 10:54.500
<i>kids, there are a thousand
amazing places you can find</i>

10:54.560 --> 10:55.860
<i>only in new york city.</i>

10:55.930 --> 10:57.200
<i>instead of any of those,</i>

10:57.260 --> 10:59.430
<i>colleen and lindsay
took us here.</i>

10:59.500 --> 11:01.200
<i>colleen:
this is our favorite restaurant</i>

11:01.260 --> 11:02.460
in the city.

11:02.530 --> 11:04.200
yes, i'm sure
this is the best

11:04.260 --> 11:08.460
of their 57 "spudtacular"
east coast locations.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.960
i'm going to run
to the restroom.

11:11.030 --> 11:14.160
i'm gonna go, too.
(growls)

11:14.230 --> 11:17.560
(ted groans, barney laughs)

11:17.630 --> 11:18.930
this is the easiest date ever.

11:18.930 --> 11:20.360
you know
what i'm gonna try next?

11:20.430 --> 11:21.760
a knock, knock joke.

11:21.830 --> 11:23.830
easiest?
somehow we have managed

11:23.900 --> 11:26.900
to find the two lamest
new yorkers of all time.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.730
ted, ted, ted.
dude,
i am looking at you.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.060
what?
right.

11:30.130 --> 11:31.630
stay with me.

11:31.700 --> 11:35.060
we are on the cusp of moving
from out-of-towners

11:35.130 --> 11:36.730
to in-their-pantsers.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.560
ay-o.

11:38.630 --> 11:39.560
all right,
ignatius,

11:39.630 --> 11:41.230
one more hour.
nice.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.100
nice. hey, nice.
hey...

11:44.160 --> 11:46.130
hey, our friends
invited us to a party.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.600
you guys want
to come along?
knock, knock.

11:48.660 --> 11:49.960
who's there?
yes, we do.

11:50.030 --> 11:52.130
(all laughing)

11:52.200 --> 11:54.130
(cheering on television)
quick announcement.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.660
i am

11:55.730 --> 11:58.660
so glad that you're here,
fellow travelers.

11:58.730 --> 12:00.400
a couple rules--

12:00.460 --> 12:01.900
not even rules.

12:01.960 --> 12:06.130
let's call them guidelines
for harmonious living.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.930
guideline
for harmonious living

12:08.000 --> 12:09.960
number one--

12:10.030 --> 12:13.730
the kitchen sink is for dishes,
the toilet is for pee-pee.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.960
g.f.h.l.

12:15.030 --> 12:16.400
number two--

12:16.460 --> 12:19.030
marijuana is illegal
in the united states,

12:19.100 --> 12:21.200
even when baked
into a blueberry muffin

12:21.260 --> 12:24.000
that someone might mistakenly
eat for breakfast

12:24.060 --> 12:27.330
right before they leave for
their job as a tv newscaster.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.530
"this just in:

12:28.600 --> 12:32.700
look at my hand,
how weird is my hand?"

12:32.760 --> 12:35.660
is not an appropriate thing
to say on the air.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.100
and number three, i...

12:37.160 --> 12:38.160
(all cheering)

12:40.930 --> 12:44.460
and number three is please keep
the noise to a minimum.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.460
i have to take a nap.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.830
i'm still pretty baked.

12:51.260 --> 12:52.660
(gasps)

12:52.730 --> 12:56.330
everything's so bright,
even at night.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.930
no wonder
the city never sleeps.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
(barney and women laughing)

12:59.060 --> 13:00.000
hey, if we're
going north,

13:00.060 --> 13:01.630
why did we cross over the fdr?

13:01.700 --> 13:02.860
we should have taken the hudson.

13:02.930 --> 13:04.900
(scoffing):
now he knows
all the streets.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.030
<i>someone's been watching
too many steinfeld reruns.</i>

13:07.100 --> 13:08.030
(women laughing)

13:08.100 --> 13:09.260
(laughs sarcastically)

13:09.330 --> 13:10.660
where are we even going anyway?

13:10.730 --> 13:12.300
148th and
brook avenue.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.760
a hundred-- in the south bronx
at this time of night?

13:15.830 --> 13:16.860
we're going to get killed.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.330
ted, i think
these local new yorkers

13:19.400 --> 13:22.960
know more about the city
than we do, so relax.

13:23.030 --> 13:25.860
we're in very capable hands.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.360
(siren wails)

13:27.430 --> 13:29.400
there were three of them,
at least two guns--

13:29.460 --> 13:30.700
they took all
oumoney.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.700
well, i only had
traveler's checks.

13:34.700 --> 13:36.960
hey, babe.

13:37.030 --> 13:39.560
i've been thinking
about our fight.

13:39.630 --> 13:40.830
yes?

13:40.900 --> 13:44.160
i'm really, really...

13:44.230 --> 13:46.900
surprised that you haven't
apologized to me yet.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.030
wow, you really want
to open this up again.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.960
oh, i forgot,
you open everything up,

13:54.030 --> 13:55.830
even if you're not supposed to
until i'm dead.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.830
you know that this
is important to me.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.330
why won't you just
write the letter?

13:59.400 --> 14:02.400
because i can't bear the
thought of not being with you,

14:02.460 --> 14:05.700
not even for long enough
to write you a stupid letter.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.260
really?

14:07.330 --> 14:09.000
yes, really.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.860
plus, i know
as soon as i write it,

14:10.930 --> 14:13.100
you're just going to open
it up and read it again.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.900
lily, i won't,
i promise.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.960
okay.

14:18.030 --> 14:20.030
i'll write you a letter
for my death folder.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.260
do you mind, um,
maybe slipping

14:22.330 --> 14:24.800
in a little bit of
dirty stuff, too?

14:24.860 --> 14:27.330
i tell you what.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.360
how about i make it
all dirty stuff

14:29.430 --> 14:32.130
and slip in
a little clean stuff?

14:32.200 --> 14:33.500
you're the best.

14:33.560 --> 14:37.200
and maybe a
couple polaroids?

14:38.560 --> 14:40.000
come on,
let's get out of here.

14:40.060 --> 14:41.560
this night's a disaster.
what?!

14:41.630 --> 14:44.560
this night couldn't
have gone any better.

14:44.630 --> 14:45.730
we just survived
a mugging.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.100
you know what
that means.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.200
"thank god we're alive" sex.

14:48.260 --> 14:50.200
"thank god we're
alive" sex.

14:50.260 --> 14:51.830
it's even better

14:51.900 --> 14:53.900
than "i can't believe you
just proposed to me" sex,

14:53.960 --> 14:55.830
which i've only had,
like, four or five times.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.430
ted, please, we
are so close.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.130
all right, i'm in.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.260
i've never worked this hard
for anything in my life.

15:03.230 --> 15:04.160
whew!

15:04.230 --> 15:05.560
wow, i think
we all need

15:05.630 --> 15:08.160
to go back to our place
and recover.

15:08.230 --> 15:09.160
yeah.

15:09.230 --> 15:10.760
i just want
to celebrate

15:10.830 --> 15:12.400
the fact that
we survived.

15:12.460 --> 15:13.400
you know?

15:13.460 --> 15:14.560
mm-hmm.

15:14.630 --> 15:15.930
me, too.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.960
so where do
you live?

15:18.030 --> 15:19.560
what, west village?
close.

15:19.630 --> 15:21.430
west orange.

15:22.530 --> 15:25.300
west orange,
new jersey?
yeah.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.330
you guys live in new jersey,
not new york?

15:28.400 --> 15:29.760
theodore.
yep.

15:29.830 --> 15:31.760
new jersey?
teddy.
yeah, but don't worry,

15:31.830 --> 15:33.500
it's pretty much new york.
ted:
oh.

15:33.560 --> 15:34.530
no.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.000
oh, no.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.800
oh, no.
new jersey is not
"pretty much new york."

15:38.860 --> 15:42.100
you are not
"pretty much new yorkers."

15:42.160 --> 15:44.100
and how would
you know?
because i live here.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.600
that's right,
i live here.

15:45.660 --> 15:47.000
yes, we're full of crap.

15:47.060 --> 15:48.860
yes, we pretended
to be from out of town

15:48.930 --> 15:50.530
so we could sleep with you
and leave in the morning.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.300
but you know what's
even worse than that?

15:52.360 --> 15:55.260
saying you're a new yorker
when you're not.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.160
because this is the
greatest city in the world

15:57.230 --> 16:00.130
and you have to earn the right
to call yourself a new yorker.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.800
so why don't
you girls crawl

16:01.860 --> 16:05.130
into the open sewer pipe
you call the holland tunnel

16:05.200 --> 16:08.460
and flush yourselves back
to "pretty much new york"?

16:08.530 --> 16:09.460
because i
will do a lot

16:09.530 --> 16:11.160
to get laid,

16:11.230 --> 16:14.900
but i am not going
to new jersey!

16:14.960 --> 16:16.960
(huffs)

16:17.030 --> 16:21.730
(in accent):
you're not from missouri?

16:23.060 --> 16:26.630
well, i will be
a monkey's unc...

16:26.700 --> 16:28.500
ew.
right.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.600
can we get
a ride?

16:32.130 --> 16:34.060
hey, um, sir,

16:34.130 --> 16:35.830
can we get
a ride, too?

16:35.900 --> 16:38.130
newark, born and raised.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.330
(drumming)

16:44.400 --> 16:46.400
(sighs)

16:49.800 --> 16:52.500
can you please keep it down?

16:52.560 --> 16:53.930
(sighs)

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
what happened to you, man?

16:56.060 --> 16:58.960
you said you wouldn't
change, but look at you.

16:59.030 --> 17:02.930
no more tan,
no more beaded braids,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.329
no more lush,

17:04.400 --> 17:08.060
untamed forest
of leg and armpit hair.

17:08.130 --> 17:09.230
