00:13.708 --> 00:16.500
Why is this happening?

00:16.583 --> 00:18.833
Please, I just want to help.

00:20.291 --> 00:21.333
What the hell?

00:31.500 --> 00:32.791
Hello?

00:35.791 --> 00:37.916
Hey. How do I open this?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.541
Hey!

00:52.625 --> 00:54.125
But it's just one line.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.166
- No, Reed.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.583
- The single line
means "not pregnant."
- Man.

00:58.666 --> 01:00.000
You peed on it, though, right?

01:00.083 --> 01:01.833
Yes, I peed on it.

01:01.916 --> 01:04.291
Oh. Okay.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.208
Don't worry.
Sometimes it takes time.

01:15.291 --> 01:17.000
Doesn't always happen
right away.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.833
- Just really excited
to start a family with you.

01:19.916 --> 01:22.583
I know you are. You love babies.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.166
- I really do.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.750
Especially
when people dress them

01:25.833 --> 01:27.375
in those-those
little business suits.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.250
- You're so silly.
- I know.

01:29.333 --> 01:31.458
It's like, "Where are you going?
You don't got a job, baby."

01:37.958 --> 01:40.666
Oh. Hi. What are you doing here?

01:40.750 --> 01:43.583
Hey. Sorry to show up so early,
but I've been thinking all night

01:43.666 --> 01:45.458
and trying to access
my own powers,

01:45.541 --> 01:47.125
and I feel like we should talk

01:47.208 --> 01:49.000
about these abilities
that are awakening in you.

01:49.083 --> 01:52.125
Oh, my God. Alma, nothing
is awakening in me, okay?

01:52.208 --> 01:53.666
I told you last night,

01:53.750 --> 01:55.958
I'm just tired from the wedding.
I just need more sleep.

01:56.041 --> 01:58.500
Oh, hey, Alma. Okay, I'm off.

01:58.583 --> 01:59.833
- I love you.
- Okay. Love you, too.

02:03.083 --> 02:04.708
Reed,
don't you have get to work?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.000
Who's gonna talk to your dad
about sports

02:06.083 --> 02:08.000
- if you're not there?
- That's a good point.

02:08.083 --> 02:11.458
- Better get going.
- Okay. Bye.

02:11.541 --> 02:13.166
You're not

02:13.250 --> 02:15.083
grasping how exciting this is.

02:15.166 --> 02:16.458
Don't you want to know
what you're capable of?

02:16.541 --> 02:18.666
- I got to get to work.
- Call in sick.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.166
I'm supposed to be writing
with Dad right now,

02:20.250 --> 02:22.083
- but this
is way more important.
- Oh, I get it.

02:22.166 --> 02:24.500
You're just trying to avoid
working on your dissertation.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.583
I'm offering you a chance

02:26.666 --> 02:28.625
to peek
behind the curtain of reality,

02:28.708 --> 02:30.708
to see
what mysteries lie beyond.

02:30.791 --> 02:32.625
I think I'm fine
just looking at the curtain.

02:32.708 --> 02:34.000
It's a very nice curtain.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.000
But I discovered something,
and I need your help.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.375
What kind of help?

02:38.458 --> 02:40.125
I told you how I'm not able
to connect right now, right?

02:40.208 --> 02:43.041
- Yeah.
- What I didn't tell you is,
every time I try to,

02:43.125 --> 02:44.916
I end up in this fog.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.500
What is this? What's happening?

02:50.208 --> 02:52.375
Hey, you're here! I know,

02:52.458 --> 02:53.875
- it's scary at first, huh?

02:53.958 --> 02:55.416
How do we get out of here?

02:55.500 --> 02:56.833
That's what I want
your help with.

02:56.916 --> 02:58.916
You see that speck coming
towards us? That's a door.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.291
Are we gonna hit it?

03:00.375 --> 03:01.458
Probably not.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.416
- Any ideas for opening this?

03:08.500 --> 03:09.916
Yeah,
maybe you shouldn't open it.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.458
Becca, it's a door.

03:11.541 --> 03:13.750
It's meant to be opened.

03:13.833 --> 03:16.083
Come on. Just try to, like,
see beyond it or something.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.750
- No, I just want
to get out of here.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.750
Okay.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.416
I don't know what you just did,

03:22.500 --> 03:24.375
but don't ever do that again.
Ever.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.916
- This is the power

03:30.000 --> 03:31.833
of your ancestors
reaching out to you.

03:31.916 --> 03:33.458
The great unknown.

03:33.541 --> 03:35.791
- This is the universe
we're talking about here.

03:35.875 --> 03:38.458
You can't just pretend
it doesn't exist.

03:40.875 --> 03:42.375
- Hey.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.333
You're denying
who you really are.

03:44.416 --> 03:45.583
You can hear me.

03:45.666 --> 03:47.666
You can hear...

04:02.916 --> 04:04.083
- Camila.
- Yes.

04:04.166 --> 04:05.750
I got
an overdraft notice.

04:05.833 --> 04:07.375
Did you take out $5,000?

04:07.458 --> 04:08.875
I was helping a cousin.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.250
What cousin?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.458
- You don't know her.
- Well,

04:11.541 --> 04:13.291
she must be pretty close
for you to give her

04:13.375 --> 04:15.541
- this much money.
- Exactly what
are you accusing me of?

04:15.625 --> 04:16.958
Accusing you? I'm not...

04:17.041 --> 04:18.833
I-I'm just trying to find out
where the money went.

04:18.916 --> 04:20.791
I have to tell you everything?
I can't have my own life?

04:20.875 --> 04:22.166
I never said that.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.583
I'm sorry you don't trust me.

04:23.666 --> 04:25.916
Jesus, Camila.
Don't make this about me.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.458
Oh, so it's always my fault,
huh?

04:27.541 --> 04:29.583
Well, just tell me the truth.
What was

04:29.666 --> 04:32.041
- the money for?
- I already told you.

04:32.125 --> 04:34.708
You know what? Forget it.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.291
- Alma.
- Hi, Mom.

04:43.375 --> 04:45.625
- Everything okay?
- Yes, of course.

04:45.708 --> 04:47.708
- Come in.
- Oh!

04:47.791 --> 04:49.250
You made your famous lemon bars.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.375
They're
for the church bake sale.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.666
Oh, cool. So, does all of the
money go to subjugating women?

04:54.750 --> 04:56.875
Or does some of it go
to protecting pedophiles?

04:59.541 --> 05:00.875
Hey, Dad.

05:00.958 --> 05:02.750
Alma, you finally made it.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.166
Well, I would go back
and get here on time,

05:05.250 --> 05:07.666
but you won't help me
figure that out, so voilÃ .

05:07.750 --> 05:10.250
Uh, don't get crumbs on my rug.

05:10.333 --> 05:12.833
Wow. You care way too much
about this reality.

05:12.916 --> 05:16.041
Okay, uh, first,
I want to go over revisions,

05:16.125 --> 05:17.750
and then we will double-check

05:17.833 --> 05:19.541
all the sources
in your bibliography.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.291
That sounds fun.

05:21.375 --> 05:23.291
I heard you and Mom arguing.
What was that about?

05:23.375 --> 05:24.541
Eh, it was nothing.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.708
She sent money somewhere?

05:25.791 --> 05:27.500
It's really
none of your business.

05:27.583 --> 05:29.416
Really? Because it sounded like

05:29.500 --> 05:31.041
she was hiding something
from you.

05:31.125 --> 05:32.375
Like maybe she's in trouble.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.291
Trouble involving
that guy I saw her with,

05:34.375 --> 05:35.791
- Alejandro?
- Hey.

05:35.875 --> 05:38.750
Let's focus
on the dissertation, okay?

05:38.833 --> 05:40.291
Okay.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.750
Page one.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.666
Hey, do you still have
your old research?

05:44.750 --> 05:46.708
Yeah, I do. It's up in the attic

05:46.791 --> 05:48.291
gathering dust. Why?

05:48.375 --> 05:51.208
Wondering if you have reports
from your old test subjects.

05:51.291 --> 05:52.458
Thought I'd check to see

05:52.541 --> 05:53.666
if anyone else
had trouble connecting

05:53.750 --> 05:55.083
- like I am.
- Alma.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.208
I'm just curious to see

05:56.291 --> 05:57.500
if there are other people
like me.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.000
There's no one like you.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.833
- What if I find someone?
- What are you talking about?

06:01.916 --> 06:03.208
Nothing.

06:03.291 --> 06:06.791
I'm just saying
it would be nice to know

06:06.875 --> 06:08.708
if there are other people
like us

06:08.791 --> 06:10.333
so we don't have to feel
so alone.

06:10.416 --> 06:12.833
You know, you can never tell
anyone what we did.

06:12.916 --> 06:15.416
That could unravel
this entire timeline.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.791
Even if we tell someone
we know we can trust?

06:17.875 --> 06:20.208
No one could understand
the things that I did.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.291
I understood.

06:21.375 --> 06:22.500
Yeah, and I appreciate that,

06:22.583 --> 06:23.750
but no one else could.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.916
So, please,
let's put the past in the past

06:26.000 --> 06:27.875
and focus on the future.

06:27.958 --> 06:29.750
Like you are?

06:29.833 --> 06:31.625
How old
is this arts and crafts project?

06:31.708 --> 06:33.250
Or this newspaper?

06:33.333 --> 06:34.875
I'm trying to understand
my mother,

06:34.958 --> 06:37.250
and I'm doing it
in a safe and normal way

06:37.333 --> 06:38.625
by studying history.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.333
- And speaking of history...

06:40.416 --> 06:42.625
...let's talk
about the agricultural practices

06:42.708 --> 06:45.875
of the ancient Mesoamericans.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.833
Okay. Let's see
these revisions of yours.

06:48.916 --> 06:50.250
Page one.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.458
Well,
I have to work through lunch.

06:52.541 --> 06:53.625
But we'll do it tonight.

06:53.708 --> 06:56.541
Okay, yes,
we can try that new position,

06:56.625 --> 06:58.333
but I don't see how...

06:58.416 --> 07:01.125
No, I get how your penis
could go in deeper,

07:01.208 --> 07:02.958
but wouldn't the semen
flow the wrong way?

07:03.041 --> 07:04.583
- Oh.

07:04.666 --> 07:06.958
Um... I have to go.

07:07.041 --> 07:09.416
Okay, bye.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.500
That was my boss.

07:11.416 --> 07:12.833
I'm kidding. It was Reed.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.916
- Oh. I hoped so.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.583
You showed up
at my office unannounced.

07:18.666 --> 07:20.458
I made some lemon bars
for the church,

07:20.541 --> 07:21.750
but I brought you some extra.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.291
Okay, well, thank you.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.041
I love your bars.

07:25.125 --> 07:29.041
To be honest,
I also came to apologize

07:29.125 --> 07:30.833
for fighting with you
last night.

07:30.916 --> 07:33.000
I know you meant well.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.458
That was my apology.

07:35.541 --> 07:38.291
Oh. Okay. I forgive you.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.833
And I'm sorry
if I was being nosy.

07:41.875 --> 07:44.333
It's just that I'm
really worried about you.

07:44.416 --> 07:45.875
You don't have to worry
about me. I am fine.

07:45.958 --> 07:48.208
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Of course.

07:48.291 --> 07:50.583
Because if there's something
going on, you can tell me.

07:50.666 --> 07:52.708
You're my mom. I'm gonna
love you no matter what.

07:52.791 --> 07:55.583
Thank you, but I am fine.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.541
Okay.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.458
And thank you again

08:00.541 --> 08:02.833
- for the bars. Do you want one?
- Oh, no.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.500
- They're just butter and sugar.
- Oh.

08:05.583 --> 08:08.875
But you are going to be
pregnant soon, and all that fat

08:08.958 --> 08:10.250
is good for the baby's brain.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.250
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.250
You mind
if I go to the bathroom?

08:26.333 --> 08:28.666
Uh, you're a grown-up.
You don't have to ask.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.666
Right.

08:54.666 --> 08:56.250
Okay.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.625
Yes.

09:16.541 --> 09:18.416
Hey, old friend.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.125
- Hi. Thanks for...
- What do you want?
I'm not in the mood

09:41.208 --> 09:43.333
to fall through
another magic cloud or whatever.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.875
- Don't worry.
I just wanted to show you this.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.875
Oh, my God. Is that Mom?

09:49.958 --> 09:51.125
Look at the signature.

09:51.208 --> 09:52.916
"Alejandro."

09:53.000 --> 09:55.041
- Right?
- Oh.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.125
The guy
that painted Mom years ago

09:57.208 --> 09:59.916
is the same guy
you saw her arguing with.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.458
Well, maybe it's a coincidence.

10:01.541 --> 10:03.000
She definitely has a history
with this guy.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.708
Check out the inscription.

10:04.791 --> 10:08.375
"Para mi bonita,
un pedazo de tu alma

10:08.458 --> 10:09.708
siempre estarÃ¡ aquÃ­."

10:09.791 --> 10:11.000
"For my beauty,

10:11.083 --> 10:13.625
a piece of your soul
will always be here."

10:13.708 --> 10:14.916
Very poetic.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.458
Just the kind of thing
you'd say to a lover.

10:17.541 --> 10:18.625
Mom probably fell in love

10:18.708 --> 10:20.125
with this Alejandro guy
back in Mexico,

10:20.208 --> 10:22.000
and they've been having
an affair ever since.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.791
Oh, come on, Alma.
This is Mom we're talking about.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.708
- She's literally
at a church bake sale right now.
- I know.

10:27.791 --> 10:29.041
It's hard
for me to believe, too.

10:29.125 --> 10:32.000
But maybe
we don't really know Mom.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.500
This morning,

10:33.583 --> 10:35.375
I found out
she wired $5,000 to Mexico

10:35.458 --> 10:36.750
and then tried to hide it
from Dad.

10:36.833 --> 10:38.083
Why would she do that?

10:38.166 --> 10:39.541
What if Alejandro
is blackmailing her?

10:39.625 --> 10:40.791
- Trying to get money

10:40.875 --> 10:42.416
so he won't tell Dad
about the affair.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.833
Do you really think
that's possible?

10:43.916 --> 10:45.000
I don't know,
but we have to find out.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.291
It's the only way to help her.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.375
I know. I've tried
to get her to open up to me,

10:48.458 --> 10:51.083
- but she won't talk to me
about it.
- Mm-hmm.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.166
Maybe there's another way.

10:55.250 --> 10:59.875
What if you and I travel back
to when you saw him in the car?

10:59.958 --> 11:01.291
Maybe we see something new.

11:01.375 --> 11:03.750
Okay, I get it.
This is you hoping

11:03.833 --> 11:06.291
that I'll time-travel back
to my memories or whatever.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.875
Would it be so bad?

11:07.958 --> 11:11.166
- Becca, this thing we do
is miraculous.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.916
We could use it
to help our family.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.583
- To save lives.
- Alma, let's be real.

11:15.666 --> 11:17.916
I've had a few vivid memories.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.458
You saw a door you can't open.
We're not saving lives.

11:20.541 --> 11:21.791
I saved Dad.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.916
What do you mean?

11:24.958 --> 11:27.958
I mean, you know,

11:28.041 --> 11:30.750
metaphorically saved his soul

11:30.833 --> 11:32.750
in the sense
that all kids save their parents

11:32.833 --> 11:34.750
by giving their life meaning.
That's what I meant.

11:34.833 --> 11:36.583
Look, can you just trust me?
We could use this

11:36.666 --> 11:38.666
to make life better.

11:38.750 --> 11:41.416
I don't want
to make my life better.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.875
Unlike you,
I'm actually happy with my life

11:43.958 --> 11:46.583
because I have a husband
and friends and a career...

11:46.666 --> 11:47.791
I have friends.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.833
- I don't hang out with them.
- Mm-hmm.

11:50.916 --> 11:53.208
But I look at pictures
of their dogs and shit online.

11:53.291 --> 11:54.625
You know what I think, Alma?

11:54.708 --> 11:56.083
I think you're a little bored
of being a professor.

11:56.166 --> 11:57.291
I think you're a little lonely,

11:57.375 --> 11:58.916
and you're looking
for a sense of purpose.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.125
And what's your purpose, Becca?
"To look pretty

12:01.208 --> 12:02.916
and be nice and do everything

12:03.000 --> 12:04.750
that Mother
and Husband tell me to do"?

12:04.833 --> 12:06.750
You're not living a life, Becca.

12:06.833 --> 12:08.875
You're living an idea of a life,

12:08.958 --> 12:10.916
- and it's not even your idea.
- That's not true.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.583
At least I'm trying to connect
to something larger than myself

12:13.666 --> 12:15.083
so I can actually do
something meaningful

12:15.166 --> 12:16.291
with my life. What are you doing

12:16.375 --> 12:18.208
- with your life?
- Living it.

12:23.916 --> 12:26.416
Hey, babe. Sorry I'm late.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.625
Alma was in one of her moods.
Ugh.

12:28.708 --> 12:30.583
What's wrong?

12:30.666 --> 12:34.833
Nick came over to watch golf,
so we ordered hot wings.

12:34.916 --> 12:36.458
But I ate too many.

12:36.541 --> 12:39.500
- Got heartburn.
- Babe.

12:39.583 --> 12:40.708
You've got to be careful
with those.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.541
And I looked everywhere
for Tums.

12:42.625 --> 12:45.291
But then
in your bathroom drawer,

12:45.375 --> 12:47.041
I found these.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.000
Are you still taking
birth control pills?

12:50.083 --> 12:53.708
No. Of course not.

12:53.791 --> 12:56.750
Those are from, um,
before we were married.

12:56.833 --> 12:59.583
- Oh, okay. That makes sense.
- Yeah.

13:00.916 --> 13:02.041
Except I know you,

13:02.125 --> 13:03.833
and I can tell
when you're shitting me.

13:04.875 --> 13:06.708
I'm not shitting you.

13:06.791 --> 13:08.791
You swear that you're
telling the truth right now?

13:08.875 --> 13:10.291
Well, what are...
what are you saying?

13:10.375 --> 13:12.458
- That I lie all the time?
- No. No, no.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.583
- That's not what I'm saying.
- You saying you basically,
like, married a liar?

13:14.666 --> 13:15.833
I'm just trying to understand.

13:15.916 --> 13:17.375
Do you not want to have a baby
with me?

13:17.458 --> 13:19.791
No! Of c... Yes, I do.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.333
Then why are you taking
these pills?

13:21.416 --> 13:23.875
They are
from before we were married.

13:23.958 --> 13:27.041
I can't deal with this.
- What?

13:27.125 --> 13:29.000
- Come on, Reed.
- No.

13:29.083 --> 13:30.916
- I can't.
- Where are you going?
Talk to me.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.250
No, I am going
to my parents' house.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.250
I need to be
with people I can trust.

14:06.291 --> 14:08.458
Hey, Sam.

14:08.541 --> 14:10.541
Hey.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.833
I'm sorry,
how do we know each other again?

14:13.916 --> 14:17.833
I met you at a party
with your girlfriend.

14:17.916 --> 14:19.958
- We were all really drunk.
You probably don't remember.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.333
- Oh. Okay.

14:21.416 --> 14:23.625
Um, it's really nice
to meet you again.

14:23.708 --> 14:25.333
- I'm Alma.
- Sam.

14:26.791 --> 14:28.375
So, you-you seem good.

14:28.458 --> 14:29.666
Oh, um...

14:29.750 --> 14:32.666
I am. Yeah. Thanks.

14:32.750 --> 14:36.333
Good. I'm glad.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.291
I was right.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.791
About my dad.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.000
About everything.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.666
I'm sorry, what?

14:46.750 --> 14:49.541
Just our conversation
from the party.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.916
- Oh.
- You don't remember. It's fine.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.166
All right, well, um,
I got to get going,

14:57.250 --> 14:59.458
but it was really nice
to meet you again.

14:59.541 --> 15:02.208
And I'm really glad
you were right.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.416
Becca?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.833
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

15:18.916 --> 15:20.958
- I'm so glad you're here.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.708
I'm sorry
for the shit I said earlier.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.166
No, it's fine. You're right.
I don't know what I'm doing,

15:25.250 --> 15:27.250
and now I'm in a huge fight
with Reed.

15:27.333 --> 15:30.208
I just need
someone to drink with.

15:30.291 --> 15:33.666
- You came to the right place.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.166
Do you want to have
a baby with him?

15:37.250 --> 15:38.875
Yes.

15:38.958 --> 15:42.083
Oh, probably.
I don't know. I'm s...

15:42.166 --> 15:45.583
I'm worried about if I'm ready

15:45.666 --> 15:48.291
to be responsible for a child.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.166
- Have you told him that?
- I can't

15:50.250 --> 15:52.375
because he thinks I'm
super together and competent.

15:52.458 --> 15:54.833
If he knew how unsure I was
of this, it would wreck him.

15:54.916 --> 15:56.833
So I just keep trying
to hide it, and then

15:56.916 --> 15:59.166
that leads to me lying to him,
which makes it worse.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.500
Well, at least
you're not cheating on him.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.791
No, I would never cheat on him.

16:02.875 --> 16:05.750
Excuse me, what's that look?
I've never cheated on him.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.500
- Yeah, not in this life.
- What?

16:07.583 --> 16:09.166
Don't listen to me.
I'm shit-faced.

16:17.041 --> 16:18.750
Wow.
I can't believe you're playing

16:18.833 --> 16:20.750
- that stupid song.
- What stupid song?

16:20.833 --> 16:22.291
- Ugh.
- I don't even know
what I'm playing.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.708
I know exactly what
you're doing. You always try

16:24.791 --> 16:27.250
to make me feel better
by playing the Rainbow Song.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.583
Right. The Rainbow Song.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.083
This was so long ago.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.750
You brought us here.

17:11.833 --> 17:13.666
You used your gift.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.625
I didn't mean to.
I was just remembering

17:16.708 --> 17:18.666
the very first day that we
made up the Rainbow Song.

17:18.750 --> 17:20.500
- I remember it, too.

17:20.583 --> 17:21.958
You came home from kindergarten

17:22.041 --> 17:23.958
with a silly poem
about rainbows.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.333
And then Dad
came up with the tune.

17:26.416 --> 17:29.000
It was something
Grandma Geraldine used to hum.

17:29.083 --> 17:32.625
I was so proud
that Dad liked my song.

17:34.458 --> 17:38.125
Becca, this is one of the things
we can do together.

17:38.208 --> 17:40.333
Go back to these happy memories.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.875
You would always play it for me
when things got hard.

17:47.958 --> 17:50.833
You don't remember
making nine long-distance calls

17:50.916 --> 17:52.791
to a strange number in Mexico?

17:52.875 --> 17:54.750
- What are you saying?
That I'm lying?
- It's okay.

17:54.833 --> 17:57.125
- Come on.
- No, I'm wondering
if these are false charges.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.291
Are you lying?

18:01.375 --> 18:02.958
You see, there you go,

18:03.041 --> 18:04.041
accusing me of lying.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.333
Camila,
what is this about?

18:05.416 --> 18:06.333
Nothing.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.333
You're good at this, Becca.

18:38.416 --> 18:41.333
I can't believe
we just did that.

18:41.416 --> 18:43.583
Yeah.

18:43.666 --> 18:45.541
Did you hear what Mom and Dad
were fighting about?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.958
Sounds like she was hiding stuff
from him even back then.

18:48.041 --> 18:50.375
Yeah,
and then she got all defensive.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.458
Just like I do with Reed.

18:52.541 --> 18:54.708
Well, they were our only model
for relationships,

18:54.791 --> 18:56.500
and they fucked us up good,
so...

18:56.583 --> 18:58.166
I will drink to that.

18:59.166 --> 19:00.791
At least we know
what poisoned their marriage.

19:00.875 --> 19:03.250
- Mom's secret affair.
- All right, fine.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.166
Let's say that you are right
about the affair.

19:05.250 --> 19:08.208
But it's still her life, right?
Like, there's nothing we can do

19:08.291 --> 19:09.333
about it.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.666
We could go back in time

19:10.750 --> 19:12.458
and make it
so she never met Alejandro.

19:12.541 --> 19:13.750
What?

19:13.833 --> 19:15.416
We can't do that. Can we?

19:15.500 --> 19:18.583
Maybe. I don't know the limit
to what you're capable of doing.

19:18.666 --> 19:20.458
Okay.

19:20.541 --> 19:23.333
But we still don't know
if it's an affair, right?

19:23.416 --> 19:26.333
Right. We have to get her
to tell us the truth.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.791
Yes. But how? I keep trying.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.083
I have an idea.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.291
Why don't we
just go over there together

19:31.375 --> 19:32.708
and demand she tell us?

19:32.791 --> 19:35.750
- Like a united front?
- Exactly. Let's go right now.

19:35.833 --> 19:38.000
Oh, come on, please?
Can't it wait till the morning?

19:38.083 --> 19:39.541
I don't know if it can.
What if that guy shows up

19:39.625 --> 19:41.333
at Mom's house with a gun
and demands more money?

19:41.416 --> 19:44.833
- Jesus Christ, Alma.
- Well, so,
you want to help Mom or not?

19:44.916 --> 19:47.041
Yes. Yes,
of course I want to help Mom.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.416
That's good,
because the car's already here.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.958
Whoa.

19:54.708 --> 19:56.625
What is it?

19:56.708 --> 19:59.833
We are here to find out
exactly what your secret is.

19:59.916 --> 20:01.333
So we can help you.

20:01.416 --> 20:03.375
Girls, it's very late,

20:03.458 --> 20:05.333
and I can smell the wine
on your breath.

20:05.416 --> 20:06.541
Who is Alejandro?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.375
You told Alma?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.541
I don't like keeping secrets
from people.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.541
Well, I told you. It's nothing.

20:13.625 --> 20:16.583
We also saw this painting
by Alejandro.

20:16.666 --> 20:17.791
Dun, dun, dun.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.791
And we know
about the money you sent.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.041
And we know about the
long-distance calls you've made.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.625
I don't know
what you're accusing me of,

20:23.708 --> 20:24.833
but I don't like it.

20:24.916 --> 20:27.166
Did you have an affair?

20:27.250 --> 20:28.625
- Excuse me?!
- I know

20:28.708 --> 20:30.958
you think that you're
protecting us by keeping it in,

20:31.041 --> 20:32.708
but whatever you're doing,
it's just making it worse.

20:32.791 --> 20:34.208
Yeah, Mom. We're adults.

20:34.291 --> 20:35.708
We can handle it. So you banged

20:35.791 --> 20:37.708
some guy behind Dad's back.
We're cool.

20:37.791 --> 20:39.541
- Please leave my house.
- No, Mom.

20:39.625 --> 20:42.125
If you care about us at all,
you have to tell us the truth,

20:42.208 --> 20:44.958
because not telling us is
just hurting the whole family.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.541
I have given my life
to this family.

20:47.625 --> 20:50.291
You have no idea
what I have given up for you.

20:52.041 --> 20:54.083
You girls are so ungrateful.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.041
What is going on?

20:58.125 --> 20:59.833
We were just trying to help Mom.

20:59.916 --> 21:01.416
Yeah, but she won't let us.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.916
I'll talk to you both
in my office.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.666
What? We're not teenagers.

21:05.875 --> 21:07.500
Okay.

21:07.583 --> 21:10.083
- What do you think
you're doing?
- It was Becca's idea.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.833
- What? No, it wasn't.
- Look, we only came

21:12.916 --> 21:14.416
because we know there's
something going on with Mom.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.625
Once we find out what's wrong,
we can go back to the past

21:16.708 --> 21:19.625
- and fix it.
- What? "Go back to the past"?
What do you mean?

21:19.708 --> 21:22.000
- It's okay. She knows.
- What does she know?

21:22.083 --> 21:24.708
Look, I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd be mad.

21:24.791 --> 21:26.125
Dad knows that we do this?

21:26.208 --> 21:27.500
Yeah. He sort of trained me.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.583
What exactly have you told her?

21:29.666 --> 21:31.458
Dad, Becca has powers, too.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.750
She took me back
to our childhood.

21:33.833 --> 21:36.291
What? You can do that?

21:36.375 --> 21:38.291
Why didn't you tell me
that Dad knows about this?

21:38.375 --> 21:41.416
Because it's complicated.
We had a different life.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.000
What do you mean,
"a different life"?

21:43.083 --> 21:44.416
- Well, Dad was...
- Alma,

21:44.500 --> 21:46.041
be careful
what you're about to say.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.958
Dad and I changed reality
to make the world better,

21:48.041 --> 21:50.000
- and-and it is.
- What do you mean?

21:50.083 --> 21:51.833
- Alma, I told you to stop.

21:51.916 --> 21:54.625
What the hell was that?
- Oh, no.

21:54.708 --> 21:56.750
- Mom!
- Mom!

21:56.833 --> 21:58.708
- Mom!
- Mom!

21:58.791 --> 22:00.208
Camila!

22:03.833 --> 22:06.250
I can't believe
Mom just left like that.

22:06.333 --> 22:08.333
What is going on with her?

22:09.375 --> 22:11.666
Alma, what have you done?
