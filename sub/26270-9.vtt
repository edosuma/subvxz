-[siren wailing]

00:03.742 --> 00:05.222
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.266 --> 00:07.050

00:07.094 --> 00:08.878

We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.666 --> 00:15.798
Only on Fox.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.064
HEN: First responders
are born twice.

00:21.108 --> 00:24.372
The first time is when
they come into the world.

00:24.415 --> 00:28.028
The second is the day
when they make the choice

00:28.071 --> 00:30.987
to spend their lives running
towards the danger.

00:31.031 --> 00:35.078
To risk everything to make sure
that you get home safe

00:35.122 --> 00:37.733
to the people you love.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.691
My name is Henrietta Wilson.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.912
And this is my story.

00:46.437 --> 00:48.265
DR. GORDON:
Don't worry.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.137
-She'll be here.
-What can I say?

00:50.180 --> 00:53.140
-I have a type.
-STEVEN: Okay, fine.

00:53.183 --> 00:56.186
Some doctors like golf,
some like gentlemen's clubs,

00:56.230 --> 00:59.059
some like, uh, Lakers tickets.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.539
It's my job to know
what makes you happy.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.325
-Spoken like a true pusher.
-[soft laughter]

01:04.368 --> 01:07.067
So, is she into guys?

01:07.110 --> 01:09.982
I mean, what's her story?

01:10.026 --> 01:12.507
-What's whose story?
-[soft laughter]

01:12.550 --> 01:14.422
We should order that nice wine,

01:14.465 --> 01:16.511
unless they're pulling in the
reins on your expense account.

01:16.554 --> 01:20.645
Ah, since the meltdown in '08,
everybody's been cutting back.

01:20.689 --> 01:23.605
I talk to my buddies in finance
and real estate.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.172
They are all flying coach

01:25.215 --> 01:26.999
and having client meetings
at Applebee's.

01:27.043 --> 01:30.438
-[laughter]
-But not us. Pharma is soaring.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.092
Well, nothing helps
the bottom line like a bunch

01:32.135 --> 01:35.269
-of depressed folks, right?
-[laughter]

01:35.312 --> 01:37.532
Well, Hen, you know
the, uh, specs on this drug.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.969
Why don't you tell them
why it's worth the cost?

01:40.012 --> 01:43.320
Well, gentlemen,
we are seeing a 14% decrease

01:43.364 --> 01:45.322
in typical side effects

01:45.366 --> 01:48.151
from all the other
antidepressants on the market.

01:48.195 --> 01:52.677
Weight gain or loss, sleep
dysfunction, loss of sex drive.

01:52.721 --> 01:57.117
You know, my patients always ask
for the generic. It's cheaper.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.207
If it's between being able
to afford the pill

02:00.250 --> 02:02.165
or no pill at all?

02:05.168 --> 02:08.693
Yeah, I think you should
probably prescribe generic.

02:08.737 --> 02:12.697
Or maybe get your patients
to go for a walk,

02:12.741 --> 02:16.919
or maybe stop the processed food
before popping a pill.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.010
-Well..
-[chuckles]

02:21.053 --> 02:23.708
You have such a warm
and generous heart.

02:23.752 --> 02:28.148
I mean, that's very unusual
for a pharma rep.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.587
Tell me more about you.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.244
I can tell you
that I don't like to be touched

02:37.287 --> 02:42.118
without an invitation,
and when people invade my space,

02:42.162 --> 02:45.121
sometimes I pin their hand
to the table

02:45.165 --> 02:46.427
with their own steak knife.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.126
[laughter]

02:55.044 --> 02:57.177
STEVEN: Hey, my office
will send over the samples

02:57.220 --> 02:58.917
first thing, okay?

02:58.961 --> 03:02.530
Hey, we'll talk soon.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.489
-What the hell was that?
-They're gonna buy.

03:05.533 --> 03:08.536
We were building and cultivating
our relationship, right?

03:08.579 --> 03:10.146
I mean, that's our job.

03:10.190 --> 03:14.933
We're selling antidepressants,
Steven, not me.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.326
Do you even like this job?

03:16.370 --> 03:20.243
Because I got to tell you,
you don't act like it.

03:20.287 --> 03:23.115
You know, I took this job
because I convinced myself

03:23.159 --> 03:24.813
that I'll be helping people

03:24.856 --> 03:26.597
if I could get them
the medicine that they needed.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.818
But that was, that was just
a story I was telling myself.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.820
Do I like this job?

03:31.863 --> 03:33.822
Hell no.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.824
I hate it.

03:35.867 --> 03:39.610
This is not me.
None of this is me.

03:39.654 --> 03:42.047
So, what are you trying to say?

03:42.091 --> 03:44.006
I quit.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.106
What?

04:00.283 --> 04:02.329
I have just never seen someone

04:02.372 --> 04:05.723
set their entire life
on fire before.

04:07.421 --> 04:09.336
[car door closes]

04:20.912 --> 04:22.610
[clock ticking]

04:45.372 --> 04:47.287
[exhales]

04:49.376 --> 04:51.116
So, what's it say?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.293
What kind of job
should I be doing?

04:57.906 --> 04:59.647
Is it that bad?

04:59.690 --> 05:02.345
The test only works
if you give honest answers.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.129
-I was.
-I feel like

05:04.173 --> 05:06.088
all your answers were for me.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.481
That you wrote down things

05:07.524 --> 05:09.961
that you thought you were
supposed to say.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.963
[laughs softly]

05:12.007 --> 05:14.705
I feel like that's been
my problem my whole life.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.360
Not that I don't speak my mind.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.319
You can ask my mom,
my girlfriend,

05:19.362 --> 05:21.973
or any boss that I've ever had
about that,

05:22.017 --> 05:25.150
but in terms of the jobs
that I've taken,

05:25.194 --> 05:27.152
they weren't what I wanted.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.763
They were just what I felt like

05:28.806 --> 05:31.113
I was supposed to be doing
at the time.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.333
So let me ask you a question.

05:33.376 --> 05:37.337
What is it that you hate,
more than anything else?

05:37.380 --> 05:41.341
What is it that drives you
absolutely bananas?

05:41.384 --> 05:43.386
Bullies.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.432
-Bullies?
-Yeah.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.303
They find people
at their weakest,

05:47.347 --> 05:49.871
their most vulnerable,
and attack.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.655
Like, how, how do you
offer someone,

05:51.699 --> 05:53.614
who's already down
on their knees, a fist

05:53.657 --> 05:55.529
when what they need is a hand?

05:55.572 --> 06:00.969
So you feel a desire
to protect the vulnerable.

06:01.012 --> 06:04.407
Like a vigilante or something?

06:04.451 --> 06:07.410
Might be fun.
I mean, the hours suck

06:07.454 --> 06:09.194
-and the benefits are terrible.
-[stifled laugh]

06:09.238 --> 06:10.631
[both laugh]

06:13.460 --> 06:15.200
You know, you don't need a test

06:15.244 --> 06:17.159
to find out
what you're meant to do.

06:17.202 --> 06:20.728
You have a fire within.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.686
[inhales, grunts]

06:25.036 --> 06:26.908
[exhales]

06:26.951 --> 06:28.300
Are you okay?

06:29.606 --> 06:31.826
I slept wrong last night.

06:31.869 --> 06:35.612
And I've had this pain all day.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.048
Where were we?

06:37.092 --> 06:40.400
You have a fire,
a passion, a purpose.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.967
And I know this
is gonna sound cliché,

06:43.011 --> 06:46.449
but there's a voice inside of us
that, when we listen to it,

06:46.493 --> 06:50.410
when we quiet ourselves and
just listen, all will be well.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.282
All will be revealed...

06:53.325 --> 06:55.806
-[gasps]
-Oh, Stacey!

06:57.895 --> 06:59.244
Oh, hell no.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.425
[phone beeps, line rings]

07:06.556 --> 07:08.036
HEN:
Hi, um...

07:29.100 --> 07:30.188
PARAMEDIC:
We'll get it from here.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.755
Let Dispatch know
we're en route.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.627
She's gonna be okay, right?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.455
Just fine, thanks to you.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.501
-Me?
-Starting CPR that quick
makes all the difference.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.460
-Probably saved her life.
-I was a lifeguard

07:40.503 --> 07:42.157
one summer as a kid.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.811
Must have been a good one.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.465
Even people with training
tend to panic

07:45.508 --> 07:47.641
when they're confronted
by the real thing.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.599
Nice job.

07:57.825 --> 08:01.524
HEN: It was like
this total rush came over me.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.831
I just knew exactly what to do,

08:03.874 --> 08:05.746
and I did it, I saved her.

08:05.789 --> 08:09.010
I'm so proud of you, baby.

08:09.053 --> 08:11.621
You never cease to amaze me.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.931
Man, I walked into her office
this morning completely unsure

08:16.974 --> 08:18.585
of what I wanted
to do with my life.

08:18.628 --> 08:22.023
And now, I mean,
what if I found it?

08:22.066 --> 08:23.590
What if you found what?

08:23.633 --> 08:26.506
That thing. My purpose.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.247
It was all the stuff
Stacey was talking about.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.946
I'm meant to save
people's lives.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.296
[laughs]:
Okay, I get that you're happy,

08:34.339 --> 08:38.300
you know, and-and you should be,
but this was a, a fluke, right?

08:38.343 --> 08:41.303
I mean, you can't believe
it's some sign from God.

08:41.346 --> 08:44.872
No, I think the sign came
from God when I was 16

08:44.915 --> 08:47.178
and I got shot and lived.

08:47.222 --> 08:50.138
This is Him sending me
a reminder.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.445
You know what? Forget it.

08:53.489 --> 08:56.448
Hey, no, I'm not
being dismissive.

08:56.492 --> 09:00.844
Today, my life
finally came into focus.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.760
It's that passion
Stacey was talking about.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.458
Yeah, well,
passion is for rich people.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.199
And the rest of us, we work.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.810
Well, I'm tired of just working.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.463
Well, paramedics,
they go through tons

09:11.507 --> 09:12.813
of physical training.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.205
I mean, it's like being
a firefighter.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.381
So I'll just--
I'll get in shape.

09:16.425 --> 09:19.341
They're trying to recruit women
now, you know?

09:19.384 --> 09:22.518
Well, is that
what you really want?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.607
Want to be the black lesbian
in the firehouse?

09:24.651 --> 09:27.175
You know, you act
like I'm-a march in there

09:27.218 --> 09:29.220
with a rainbow flag.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.179
No one knows I'm a lesbian.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.790
It's just firehouses
are boys clubs, Hen.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.445
-And white boys clubs.
-[stifled laugh]

09:36.488 --> 09:37.794
Well, then I'll just have
to Rosa Parks

09:37.838 --> 09:39.361

now, won't I?

09:44.714 --> 09:47.064

09:47.108 --> 09:50.502

about this?

09:52.722 --> 09:54.637
Yes.

09:56.421 --> 09:59.120
I know it won't be easy.

09:59.163 --> 10:02.819
But I at least got to try.

10:05.387 --> 10:08.608
I need you to want this
for me, too.

10:08.651 --> 10:11.828
Hey, if you want it, I want it.

10:11.872 --> 10:16.354
You know I will
always support you.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.313
Always.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.319
You're like a hero.

Since you've started
