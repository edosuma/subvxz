00:02.393 --> 00:03.699
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-[siren wailing]

00:03.742 --> 00:05.222
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.266 --> 00:07.050
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:07.094 --> 00:08.878
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.921 --> 00:12.055
Empire, The Resident,
andThe Gifted.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.623
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.666 --> 00:15.798
Only on Fox.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.064
HEN: First responders
are born twice.

00:21.108 --> 00:24.372
The first time is when
they come into the world.

00:24.415 --> 00:28.028
The second is the day
when they make the choice

00:28.071 --> 00:30.987
to spend their lives running
towards the danger.

00:31.031 --> 00:35.078
To risk everything to make sure
that you get home safe

00:35.122 --> 00:37.733
to the people you love.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.691
My name is Henrietta Wilson.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.912
And this is my story.

00:46.437 --> 00:48.265
DR. GORDON:
Don't worry.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.137
-She'll be here.
-What can I say?

00:50.180 --> 00:53.140
-I have a type.
-STEVEN: Okay, fine.

00:53.183 --> 00:56.186
Some doctors like golf,
some like gentlemen's clubs,

00:56.230 --> 00:59.059
some like, uh, Lakers tickets.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.539
It's my job to know
what makes you happy.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.325
-Spoken like a true pusher.
-[soft laughter]

01:04.368 --> 01:07.067
So, is she into guys?

01:07.110 --> 01:09.982
I mean, what's her story?

01:10.026 --> 01:12.507
-What's whose story?
-[soft laughter]

01:12.550 --> 01:14.422
We should order that nice wine,

01:14.465 --> 01:16.511
unless they're pulling in the
reins on your expense account.

01:16.554 --> 01:20.645
Ah, since the meltdown in '08,
everybody's been cutting back.

01:20.689 --> 01:23.605
I talk to my buddies in finance
and real estate.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.172
They are all flying coach

01:25.215 --> 01:26.999
and having client meetings
at Applebee's.

01:27.043 --> 01:30.438
-[laughter]
-But not us. Pharma is soaring.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.092
Well, nothing helps
the bottom line like a bunch

01:32.135 --> 01:35.269
-of depressed folks, right?
-[laughter]

01:35.312 --> 01:37.532
Well, Hen, you know
the, uh, specs on this drug.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.969
Why don't you tell them
why it's worth the cost?

01:40.012 --> 01:43.320
Well, gentlemen,
we are seeing a 14% decrease

01:43.364 --> 01:45.322
in typical side effects

01:45.366 --> 01:48.151
from all the other
antidepressants on the market.

01:48.195 --> 01:52.677
Weight gain or loss, sleep
dysfunction, loss of sex drive.

01:52.721 --> 01:57.117
You know, my patients always ask
for the generic. It's cheaper.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.207
If it's between being able
to afford the pill

02:00.250 --> 02:02.165
or no pill at all?

02:05.168 --> 02:08.693
Yeah, I think you should
probably prescribe generic.

02:08.737 --> 02:12.697
Or maybe get your patients
to go for a walk,

02:12.741 --> 02:16.919
or maybe stop the processed food
before popping a pill.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.010
-Well..
-[chuckles]

02:21.053 --> 02:23.708
You have such a warm
and generous heart.

02:23.752 --> 02:28.148
I mean, that's very unusual
for a pharma rep.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.587
Tell me more about you.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.244
I can tell you
that I don't like to be touched

02:37.287 --> 02:42.118
without an invitation,
and when people invade my space,

02:42.162 --> 02:45.121
sometimes I pin their hand
to the table

02:45.165 --> 02:46.427
with their own steak knife.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.126
[laughter]

02:55.044 --> 02:57.177
STEVEN: Hey, my office
will send over the samples

02:57.220 --> 02:58.917
first thing, okay?

02:58.961 --> 03:02.530
Hey, we'll talk soon.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.489
-What the hell was that?
-They're gonna buy.

03:05.533 --> 03:08.536
We were building and cultivating
our relationship, right?

03:08.579 --> 03:10.146
I mean, that's our job.

03:10.190 --> 03:14.933
We're selling antidepressants,
Steven, not me.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.326
Do you even like this job?

03:16.370 --> 03:20.243
Because I got to tell you,
you don't act like it.

03:20.287 --> 03:23.115
You know, I took this job
because I convinced myself

03:23.159 --> 03:24.813
that I'll be helping people

03:24.856 --> 03:26.597
if I could get them
the medicine that they needed.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.818
But that was, that was just
a story I was telling myself.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.820
Do I like this job?

03:31.863 --> 03:33.822
Hell no.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.824
I hate it.

03:35.867 --> 03:39.610
This is not me.
None of this is me.

03:39.654 --> 03:42.047
So, what are you trying to say?

03:42.091 --> 03:44.006
I quit.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.106
What?

04:00.283 --> 04:02.329
I have just never seen someone

04:02.372 --> 04:05.723
set their entire life
on fire before.

04:07.421 --> 04:09.336
[car door closes]

04:20.912 --> 04:22.610
[clock ticking]

04:45.372 --> 04:47.287
[exhales]

04:49.376 --> 04:51.116
So, what's it say?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.293
What kind of job
should I be doing?

04:57.906 --> 04:59.647
Is it that bad?

04:59.690 --> 05:02.345
The test only works
if you give honest answers.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.129
-I was.
-I feel like

05:04.173 --> 05:06.088
all your answers were for me.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.481
That you wrote down things

05:07.524 --> 05:09.961
that you thought you were
supposed to say.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.963
[laughs softly]

05:12.007 --> 05:14.705
I feel like that's been
my problem my whole life.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.360
Not that I don't speak my mind.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.319
You can ask my mom,
my girlfriend,

05:19.362 --> 05:21.973
or any boss that I've ever had
about that,

05:22.017 --> 05:25.150
but in terms of the jobs
that I've taken,

05:25.194 --> 05:27.152
they weren't what I wanted.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.763
They were just what I felt like

05:28.806 --> 05:31.113
I was supposed to be doing
at the time.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.333
So let me ask you a question.

05:33.376 --> 05:37.337
What is it that you hate,
more than anything else?

05:37.380 --> 05:41.341
What is it that drives you
absolutely bananas?

05:41.384 --> 05:43.386
Bullies.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.432
-Bullies?
-Yeah.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.303
They find people
at their weakest,

05:47.347 --> 05:49.871
their most vulnerable,
and attack.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.655
Like, how, how do you
offer someone,

05:51.699 --> 05:53.614
who's already down
on their knees, a fist

05:53.657 --> 05:55.529
when what they need is a hand?

05:55.572 --> 06:00.969
So you feel a desire
to protect the vulnerable.

06:01.012 --> 06:04.407
Like a vigilante or something?

06:04.451 --> 06:07.410
Might be fun.
I mean, the hours suck

06:07.454 --> 06:09.194
-and the benefits are terrible.
-[stifled laugh]

06:09.238 --> 06:10.631
[both laugh]

06:13.460 --> 06:15.200
You know, you don't need a test

06:15.244 --> 06:17.159
to find out
what you're meant to do.

06:17.202 --> 06:20.728
You have a fire within.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.686
[inhales, grunts]

06:25.036 --> 06:26.908
[exhales]

06:26.951 --> 06:28.300
Are you okay?

06:29.606 --> 06:31.826
I slept wrong last night.

06:31.869 --> 06:35.612
And I've had this pain all day.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.048
Where were we?

06:37.092 --> 06:40.400
You have a fire,
a passion, a purpose.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.967
And I know this
is gonna sound clichÃ©,

06:43.011 --> 06:46.449
but there's a voice inside of us
that, when we listen to it,

06:46.493 --> 06:50.410
when we quiet ourselves and
just listen, all will be well.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.282
All will be revealed...

06:53.325 --> 06:55.806
-[gasps]
-Oh, Stacey!

06:57.895 --> 06:59.244
Oh, hell no.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.425
[phone beeps, line rings]

07:06.556 --> 07:08.036
HEN:
Hi, um...

07:29.100 --> 07:30.188
PARAMEDIC:
We'll get it from here.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.755
Let Dispatch know
we're en route.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.627
She's gonna be okay, right?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.455
Just fine, thanks to you.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.501
-Me?
-Starting CPR that quick
makes all the difference.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.460
-Probably saved her life.
-I was a lifeguard

07:40.503 --> 07:42.157
one summer as a kid.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.811
Must have been a good one.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.465
Even people with training
tend to panic

07:45.508 --> 07:47.641
when they're confronted
by the real thing.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.599
Nice job.

07:57.825 --> 08:01.524
HEN: It was like
this total rush came over me.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.831
I just knew exactly what to do,

08:03.874 --> 08:05.746
and I did it, I saved her.

08:05.789 --> 08:09.010
I'm so proud of you, baby.

08:09.053 --> 08:11.621
You never cease to amaze me.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.931
Man, I walked into her office
this morning completely unsure

08:16.974 --> 08:18.585
of what I wanted
to do with my life.

08:18.628 --> 08:22.023
And now, I mean,
what if I found it?

08:22.066 --> 08:23.590
What if you found what?

08:23.633 --> 08:26.506
That thing. My purpose.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.247
It was all the stuff
Stacey was talking about.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.946
I'm meant to save
people's lives.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.296
[laughs]:
Okay, I get that you're happy,

08:34.339 --> 08:38.300
you know, and-and you should be,
but this was a, a fluke, right?

08:38.343 --> 08:41.303
I mean, you can't believe
it's some sign from God.

08:41.346 --> 08:44.872
No, I think the sign came
from God when I was 16

08:44.915 --> 08:47.178
and I got shot and lived.

08:47.222 --> 08:50.138
This is Him sending me
a reminder.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.445
You know what? Forget it.

08:53.489 --> 08:56.448
Hey, no, I'm not
being dismissive.

08:56.492 --> 09:00.844
Today, my life
finally came into focus.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.760
It's that passion
Stacey was talking about.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.458
Yeah, well,
passion is for rich people.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.199
And the rest of us, we work.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.810
Well, I'm tired of just working.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.463
Well, paramedics,
they go through tons

09:11.507 --> 09:12.813
of physical training.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.205
I mean, it's like being
a firefighter.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.381
So I'll just--
I'll get in shape.

09:16.425 --> 09:19.341
They're trying to recruit women
now, you know?

09:19.384 --> 09:22.518
Well, is that
what you really want?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.607
Want to be the black lesbian
in the firehouse?

09:24.651 --> 09:27.175
You know, you act
like I'm-a march in there

09:27.218 --> 09:29.220
with a rainbow flag.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.179
No one knows I'm a lesbian.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.790
It's just firehouses
are boys clubs, Hen.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.445
-And white boys clubs.
-[stifled laugh]

09:36.488 --> 09:37.794
Well, then I'll just have
to Rosa Parks

09:37.838 --> 09:39.361
the hell out of it,
now, won't I?

09:39.404 --> 09:41.319
[laughs softly]

09:44.714 --> 09:47.064
[sighs]

09:47.108 --> 09:50.502
You're really serious
about this?

09:52.722 --> 09:54.637
Yes.

09:56.421 --> 09:59.120
I know it won't be easy.

09:59.163 --> 10:02.819
But I at least got to try.

10:05.387 --> 10:08.608
I need you to want this
for me, too.

10:08.651 --> 10:11.828
Hey, if you want it, I want it.

10:11.872 --> 10:16.354
You know I will
always support you.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.313
Always.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.319
You're like a hero.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.887
[both laugh softly]

10:26.930 --> 10:29.063
THOMAS:
Please find a seat.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.284
You see this?

10:33.328 --> 10:37.288
This is a Los Angeles
Firefighter Paramedic patch.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.987
You're all here
because you want to wear one.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.249
Most of you never will.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.339
Okay, Wilson,
show me what you got.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.775
Watch your technique. Faster!

10:45.819 --> 10:48.082
Here we go, Wilson, come on.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.605
Keep the pace, keep the pace.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.215
Membership
into the world's elite

10:51.259 --> 10:52.782
lifesaving service
must be earned.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.741
Physically and mentally,

10:54.784 --> 10:56.743
you'll be tested as though
your life depended on it,

10:56.786 --> 10:59.571
because that's the business
we are in:

10:59.615 --> 11:00.921
life and death.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.010
Push.

11:03.053 --> 11:06.491
âª Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom...

11:06.535 --> 11:07.710
Let's go, let's go, move.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.059
Let's go, let's move!

11:09.103 --> 11:10.757
That's it, that's it.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.150
Don't let him die.
Do not let him die!

11:13.194 --> 11:14.674
Pull, pull, pull!

11:14.717 --> 11:16.023
âª I'm your
ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch... âª

11:16.066 --> 11:17.633
Let's go.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.940
Damn, Wilson, we're supposed
to save cats, not wear them.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.029
âª Teenage blues

11:22.072 --> 11:25.423
âª Get down now 'cause
you got nothing to lose âª

11:25.467 --> 11:29.427
âª Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom

11:29.471 --> 11:30.864
âª I'm your
ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch âª

11:30.907 --> 11:32.953
âª Cherry bomb

11:32.996 --> 11:36.696
âª Hello, world,
I'm your wild girl âª

11:36.739 --> 11:38.610
âª I'm your
ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch âª

11:38.654 --> 11:41.439
âª Cherry bomb

11:41.483 --> 11:43.050
I don't think you got it,
Wilson.

11:43.093 --> 11:46.531
Come on, Wilson, I don't
know if you can do this.

11:46.575 --> 11:50.753
How bad you want to wear
that patch, Wilson?

11:50.797 --> 11:51.798
You're not gonna make it,
are you?

11:51.841 --> 11:53.321
Show me!

11:53.364 --> 11:55.584
Let's go, let's go.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.064
You're losing your pace,
come on.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.021
Keep the pace.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.809
Get up or give up, Wilson.
They're laughing at you.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.114
You gonna let
these guys laugh at you?

12:04.158 --> 12:06.508
âª Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom

12:06.551 --> 12:08.466
âª I'm your
ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch âª

12:08.510 --> 12:10.642
âª Cherry bomb...

12:10.686 --> 12:12.644
If you feel even
the slightest glimmer of doubt

12:12.688 --> 12:15.212
about your ability to make
that kind of commitment,

12:15.256 --> 12:18.041
then I suggest
you back out that door.

12:18.085 --> 12:21.828
âª Cherry bomb,
cherry bomb âª

12:21.871 --> 12:25.005
âª Cherry bomb, cherry bomb

12:25.048 --> 12:27.834
-Henrietta Wilson.
-âª Cherry bomb.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.792
THOMAS:
Congratulations.

12:29.836 --> 12:33.927
You are now a Los Angeles
Firefighter Paramedic.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.673
[indistinct chatter in distance]

13:12.530 --> 13:14.794
GERRARD:
Wilson.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.232
Captain Gerrard?

13:18.275 --> 13:19.842
Is that your real name,
"Henrietta"?

13:19.886 --> 13:21.452
Yes, sir.

13:21.496 --> 13:24.151
What'd you do to your parents
to deserve a name like that?

13:25.935 --> 13:29.765
You're prettier than most,
I'll give you that.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.508
That's the women's locker room.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.466
Don't mind the Ping-Pong table.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.599
We'll move it out in a week
if you're still here.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.822
-Yes, sir.
-Guys.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.389
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.524
-Who's this?
-This is our new

13:49.567 --> 13:52.657
diversity hire.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.964
-For real?
-You know, Cap,

13:55.008 --> 13:57.924
-there's another way
to say that.
-Yeah.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.230
GERRARD:
We're screwed.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.324
I'm Howie.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.892
Hen.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.547
Welcome to the 118.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.033
[thunder rumbles]

14:24.951 --> 14:27.388
[reverse warning beeping]

14:53.022 --> 14:55.807
What'd you end up doing
last night, Sal?

14:55.851 --> 14:57.679
Gina dragged me
to that vampire movie.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.768
Twilight.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.118
Seriously, that's what you did
with your day off?

15:02.162 --> 15:03.728
Wasn't half bad.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.252
Honestly, I couldn't really tell
you what happened in it,

15:05.295 --> 15:07.950
but that Kristen Stewart,
oh, sweet mama.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.561
I really like
Kristen Stewart, too.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.563
That's something I can get
behind, know what I mean?

15:12.607 --> 15:13.738
See, I don't get that.

15:13.782 --> 15:17.003
She's too... brooding for me.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.613
-Too...
-What, hot?

15:18.656 --> 15:22.312
Maybe you're more
of a Team Jacob kind of guy.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.010
I don't even know
what that means.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.055
He's insinuating
that you're gay.

15:26.099 --> 15:30.059
-[chuckling]
-GERRARD: Easy, boys.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.279
[thunder rumbling]

15:32.322 --> 15:34.629
So, Hen, where you from?

15:34.672 --> 15:37.806
-Right here. L.A.
-Seriously?

15:37.849 --> 15:40.243
I would have bet money that
you were from the East Coast.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.462
You just kind of have that vibe.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.203
[chuckles]
Thank you for the compliment?

15:43.246 --> 15:45.074
New York bitchiness
is a compliment?

15:45.118 --> 15:47.163
Whoa, nobody said anything
like that, come on.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.948
[scoffs]

15:50.645 --> 15:53.735
Where, exactly, in L.A.,
Henrietta?

15:53.778 --> 15:57.695
-Inglewood.
-Inglewood.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.570
[clears throat]
You know what, Cap?

16:02.613 --> 16:04.006
Uh, I've been meaning
to ask you for next...

16:04.050 --> 16:06.922
Eight women were recruited,

16:06.966 --> 16:09.185
and three of them make it
through the academy.

16:09.229 --> 16:12.362
106 stations in L.A.,

16:12.406 --> 16:14.712
and we end up
with one of the three.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.714
What did I do to deserve this?

16:16.758 --> 16:18.020
I can make an educated guess.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.674
Watch yourself.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.371
You know how much it costs
to send a woman

16:21.415 --> 16:22.938
through the academy?

16:22.982 --> 16:27.029
Same amount as it costs to put
a man through, I imagine.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.639
$82,000.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.598
That's how much money taxpayers
flush down the toilet

16:30.641 --> 16:32.513
with every failed
female recruit.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.602
I don't know.
I say if you can make it

16:34.645 --> 16:36.647
through the training,
you've earned your place.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.649
Is that what
you're worried about?

16:38.693 --> 16:40.521
The taxpayers?

16:40.564 --> 16:44.699
I'm worried about my life
and putting the lives of my men

16:44.742 --> 16:46.701
in the hands of somebody
who isn't up to the job.

16:46.744 --> 16:50.052
And I'm worried
about that poor son of a bitch

16:50.096 --> 16:53.099
who dies in a fire because
you can't drag his ass out.

16:53.142 --> 16:57.538
And this is all
because the mayor wants to say

16:57.581 --> 16:59.931
that female recruitment is up.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.980
Thatis what I'm worried about.

17:20.213 --> 17:23.085
Okay, so that was kind of ugly.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.739
[chuckles softly]

17:24.782 --> 17:26.654
Listen, the captain's
just old-school. It's...

17:26.697 --> 17:29.222
"Old" isn't the only word
that comes to mind.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.093
Look, I get what
you're trying to do,

17:31.137 --> 17:35.358
but I don't need anybody
carrying my load.

17:35.402 --> 17:38.970
Hell, I'm smart enough to know
that just by looking at you.

17:39.014 --> 17:42.974
I just wanted to make sure
you knew you weren't alone here.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.285
Thank you.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.036
[thunder rumbling]

18:13.353 --> 18:15.268
[thunder rumbling]

18:17.400 --> 18:20.925
Yeah, just, um... call me back.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.189
Thanks.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.149
Katy.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.238
From work.

18:29.282 --> 18:30.631
She, uh, says she knows someone

18:30.674 --> 18:32.372
who might be in the market
for a roommate.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.113
-It's Arcadia, though.
-Ugh.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.332
Long as you don't move back in
with the jerk.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.292
Right.
I never should've married him.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.772
-I should've listened to you.
-Hey, not true.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.644
I liked him for 48 hours:

18:43.687 --> 18:45.733
between the time you told me
you were seeing someone

18:45.776 --> 18:47.778
and when I met him.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.868
[sighs] Anyway...

18:50.912 --> 18:54.437
you don't have to be
in any hurry.

18:54.481 --> 18:55.917
I kicked you out
of your bedroom.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.049
You leave for work
an hour before me,

18:58.093 --> 18:59.399
and I don't want you
waking my ass up

18:59.442 --> 19:01.009
when you use the bathroom.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.881
Besides, it's nice

19:03.925 --> 19:06.057
in the sunroom
when it's raining.

19:06.101 --> 19:07.537
Which is, like,
once a decade now.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.631
Get some sleep.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.329
You look like hell.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.162
[sighs]

19:38.089 --> 19:40.004
[rumbling]

19:49.927 --> 19:50.841
[screams]

20:03.289 --> 20:05.204
[sirens wailing]

20:09.773 --> 20:10.992
[crying]

20:11.035 --> 20:12.341
Help!

20:13.821 --> 20:15.344
My mom is buried,
and I can't get her out.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.737
She's trapped!

20:16.780 --> 20:18.260
Come here,
show me where your mom is.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.523
[indistinct chatter]

20:23.526 --> 20:25.789
GERRARD:
Guys, this structure's unstable.

20:25.833 --> 20:26.877
Watch yourself.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.271
KILEY:
She was buried,

20:29.315 --> 20:31.186
and I found her,
but I-I couldn't get her out.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.492
Okay, we're gonna help your mom.

20:32.535 --> 20:33.580
No, I want to be with her.

20:33.623 --> 20:34.624
We just need you to stand back.

20:34.668 --> 20:35.886
It's not safe in there, okay?

20:35.930 --> 20:37.540
We need room to do our work.
Please.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.281
Ma'am, is there anybody else
in the building?

20:39.325 --> 20:40.935
No.

20:40.978 --> 20:44.895
GERRARD:
Shovels, gentlemen. Go, now!

20:44.939 --> 20:47.115
Can't breathe.

20:47.158 --> 20:48.464
I'm gonna give you some oxygen.
I'm gonna help you breathe.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.466
-Okay?
-It me, or this stuff

20:50.510 --> 20:52.251
got a mind of its own?

20:52.294 --> 20:53.469
It's like
that Steve McQueen movie.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.644
Move it! Faster!

20:54.688 --> 20:55.645
DIANNE:
Where's Kiley?

20:55.689 --> 20:57.299
Mom, I'm here.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.083
The weight is constricting
her chest, Captain.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.390
We got to relieve the pressure
on her lungs.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.527
She's unconscious. Shallowing!

21:07.570 --> 21:08.789
What's your mother's name?

21:08.832 --> 21:10.617
-Dianne.
-Dianne, can you hear me?

21:10.660 --> 21:13.489
GERRARD:
Grab her hand. Pull!

21:13.533 --> 21:16.449
[grunting]

21:16.492 --> 21:18.625
It's not the mud.
Something's pinning her down.

21:19.756 --> 21:20.888
Might be a piece of furniture.

21:20.931 --> 21:21.889
CHIMNEY:
This is like quicksand.

21:21.932 --> 21:23.630
There's too much water.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.893
-Or not enough.
-TOMMY: Not enough?

21:25.936 --> 21:27.373
You guys,
do you ever build sandcastles?

21:27.416 --> 21:29.288
What happens
when the tide comes in?

21:29.331 --> 21:31.377
[panting]

21:34.815 --> 21:37.339
Where are you going?

21:37.383 --> 21:39.950
To fetch a tide.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.126
Wilson.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.477
I love you, Mom.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.655
This block
is red-tagged, people!

21:48.698 --> 21:52.311
Do not grab belongings,
just keep moving.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.704
Just keep moving.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.750
HEN:
Officer!

21:56.793 --> 21:58.317
Can you feed me this line?

21:58.360 --> 22:00.275
Where's the fire?

22:01.972 --> 22:05.019
If this doesn't work,
they're gonna burn me alive.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.331
[firefighters speaking
indistinctly]

22:18.554 --> 22:21.427
HEN: See, the water
is loosening up the mud.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.645
Hot damn, Wilson.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.649
There's a log pinning her down.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.221
I've got it. It's coming loose.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.397
[overlapping chatter]

22:35.441 --> 22:36.964
Ready?

22:37.007 --> 22:39.096
[speaking indistinctly]

22:39.140 --> 22:41.316
[crying]

22:41.360 --> 22:43.057
-Give me a hand.
-Okay.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.841
KILEY:
Mom?

22:44.885 --> 22:46.800
Up.

22:48.584 --> 22:51.239
[indistinct chatter]

22:51.282 --> 22:54.416
She wasn't supposed to be there
in that room.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.940
-It's my fault.
-Shh. It's not your fault.

22:56.984 --> 22:59.116
It's not your fault, okay?
It's nobody's fault.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.860
Wilson.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.343
She's gonna be DOA.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.562
I know, sir.

23:09.605 --> 23:10.824
And you're telling
yourself what?

23:10.867 --> 23:12.695
That you showed us up?

23:12.739 --> 23:13.957
Well, congratulations.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.176
You got her out with enough time

23:15.219 --> 23:17.700
for her daughter
to watch her die.

23:19.702 --> 23:22.966
Hey! My number.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.751
I know a great bar
on the Westside.

23:24.794 --> 23:27.667
I'll settle for a good damn
bridge to jump off right now.

23:27.710 --> 23:31.105
I'd tell you it gets better, but
you'd know I was lying. Call me.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.486
I probably don't
have to tell you

24:04.530 --> 24:06.488
to never let them see you cry.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.404
No.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.233
This ain't my first rodeo
with men like him.

24:12.276 --> 24:14.496
It's just the first time
it happened in a job

24:14.540 --> 24:17.456
that I actually care about.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.109
Yeah, I understand.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.285
No, you don't.

24:21.329 --> 24:23.549
Oh, you think they're
inviting the Asian guy

24:23.592 --> 24:26.421
to their houses for barbecues
and out for beers?

24:26.465 --> 24:29.424
It's a big difference
between being invisible

24:29.468 --> 24:31.731
and being a threat
to their way of life.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.690
And, yes, you're a minority,
too, but you're still a man.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.257
You benefit from a system

24:36.300 --> 24:39.478
that keeps women
that look like me down.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.134
You always make friends
this easily?

24:44.178 --> 24:45.484
[chuckles]

24:45.527 --> 24:47.964
GERRARD:
Howie, quit screwing around

24:48.008 --> 24:50.358
in home ec class
and get down here.

24:56.582 --> 25:00.499
Some unsolicited advice:
doesn't have to be me,

25:00.542 --> 25:03.153
but you should talk
to someone about this.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.590
You're not gonna survive

25:04.633 --> 25:06.940
if you take this on
all by yourself, Hen.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.440
[wolf whistle]

25:32.661 --> 25:35.011
That fender's a thing
of beauty, Wilson.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.541
Like a damn mirror.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.935
It is almost as clean
as the heads.

25:45.979 --> 25:48.590
I'd let my granddaughters play
with their Barbies in there.

25:48.634 --> 25:51.027
I got a jump on it
this morning, Captain.

25:51.071 --> 25:52.681
Also cleaned the grease traps
in the kitchen,

25:52.725 --> 25:55.641
inventoried the trucks,
even got the cobwebs

25:55.684 --> 26:00.254
-in the rafters.
-Well, color me impressed.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.648
-[chuckles]
-What?

26:02.691 --> 26:06.434
You remind me of myself
when I was a rookie,

26:06.477 --> 26:09.742
stuck with all the chores.

26:09.785 --> 26:12.658
No way I was gonna let down
my captain. No way.

26:12.701 --> 26:15.095
Other thing I did
when I was a rookie

26:15.138 --> 26:17.924
was check up on my calls.

26:20.274 --> 26:23.973
Wanted to find out how
the people I treated turned out.

26:24.017 --> 26:27.063
Stopped after a month or two.

26:27.107 --> 26:29.283
There's no point.

26:29.326 --> 26:32.112
But at first I had to know.

26:32.155 --> 26:36.116
Bet you checked up
on our mud lady, didn't you?

26:36.159 --> 26:37.987
Yes.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.120
And?

26:40.163 --> 26:43.036
You were right, Captain.

26:43.079 --> 26:45.081
She didn't make it.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.953
Can't help but wonder

26:46.996 --> 26:49.912
if there's something
we could have done differently.

26:49.956 --> 26:52.001
It's hard to know.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.962
But know this.

26:58.051 --> 27:01.750
You ever go against
my command again

27:01.794 --> 27:04.057
and you won't be cleaning out
grease traps.

27:04.100 --> 27:07.234
You'll be cleaning out
your locker.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.587
You missed a spot.

27:16.939 --> 27:20.247
[alarm ringing]

27:20.290 --> 27:21.988
MAN [over P.A.]:
Attention, Station 118...

27:22.031 --> 27:24.773
No. You're sitting this one out.
I'm not ready to have you

27:24.817 --> 27:26.166
back in the field.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.037
I want you to think
about what I said

27:28.081 --> 27:29.517
while you're prepping dinner.

27:32.563 --> 27:33.521
[reverse warning beeping]

27:33.564 --> 27:35.088
[truck door closes]

27:35.131 --> 27:37.046
[engine starts]

27:41.094 --> 27:43.009
[alarm ringing]

27:45.751 --> 27:47.666
[indistinct chatter]

27:53.933 --> 27:55.543
Here she is.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.110
Hey, hey, hey.
[laughs]

27:57.153 --> 27:58.938
Oh, so glad you called.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.548
-Oh.
-[Athena chuckles]

28:00.591 --> 28:01.941
-Oh!
-Thanks for taking the time.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.812
Oh, you don't have
to thank me.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.945
I remember what it was like
starting out.

28:05.988 --> 28:09.078
I invited a couple of folks
to join us. Hope you don't mind.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.472
Usually no, but I'm not
really up for socializing.

28:11.515 --> 28:14.605
This is Henrietta Wilson, the
medic I was telling you about.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.607
âª

28:16.651 --> 28:19.088
Oh, I know that look.

28:19.132 --> 28:22.091
Casey, the gay firefighter
from the 115.

28:22.135 --> 28:24.311
-Mm-hmm.
-This is Bethanne.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.095
She works out of Rampart.

28:26.139 --> 28:29.229
Three of us-- we get together
once a month, swap war stories.

28:29.272 --> 28:32.754
[laughing]: Oh, so this is
like a support group?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.495
-Oh, relax. It is not like AA.
-[laughs]

28:34.538 --> 28:37.106
In fact, can we get
another round over here, please?

28:37.150 --> 28:38.717
[laughter]

28:48.378 --> 28:50.293
I would be expelled.

28:50.337 --> 28:53.122
âª Take me back,
take me back... âª

28:53.166 --> 28:57.039
Oh, they knew I was gay from
the moment I walked in the door.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.868
Now, never mind that I was the
strongest guy in the firehouse.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.870
All I ever wanted
to be was a fireman.

29:01.914 --> 29:03.916
You know, be a hero.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.919
But it got so hard that
my boyfriend told me to quit.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.356
He told me to find a new dream.

29:09.399 --> 29:10.966
Mm.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.446
So I found a new boyfriend.

29:12.489 --> 29:16.406
[laughter]

29:16.450 --> 29:18.931
BETHANNE:
When I first started on patrol,

29:18.974 --> 29:20.802
there was this one officer.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.935
He asked me if I knew
how to fire my pistol.

29:22.978 --> 29:26.155
I finished first in my class
in the academy,

29:26.199 --> 29:29.376
and he asked me if I knew
how to discharge my weapon.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.987
Sometimes all it takes is one
captain that should have retired

29:32.031 --> 29:33.728
ten years ago,
who hasn't kept up

29:33.772 --> 29:36.600
with the times,
to make life at work hell.

29:36.644 --> 29:39.821
-[Athena chuckles]
-What about you, Athena?

29:39.865 --> 29:43.390
Oh. You know, I had this partner
when I worked in South L.A.--

29:43.433 --> 29:46.132
white, part of the old guard.

29:46.175 --> 29:49.962
You know. He told me he always
wanted to taste some chocolate,

29:50.005 --> 29:52.442
put his hand on my thigh.

29:52.486 --> 29:53.835
I told him
if he wanted chocolate,

29:53.879 --> 29:55.663
he should go to Carvel,

29:55.706 --> 29:57.839
and that if he ever touched me
again, he'd taste it...

29:57.883 --> 29:59.362
[mouth clenched]:
through a wired jaw.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.190
[laughter]

30:01.234 --> 30:03.932
BETHANNE:
Imagine how much harder

30:03.976 --> 30:06.021
it must have been for the people
who came before us.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.544
ATHENA:
Mm. They were and we are

30:07.588 --> 30:08.937
the first responders of change,

30:08.981 --> 30:11.244
and change
doesn't happen overnight,

30:11.287 --> 30:12.898
but it does happen.

30:12.941 --> 30:14.638
So you know what you do.

30:14.682 --> 30:17.424
You go in there tomorrow,
you do your work.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.469
Outshine them.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.167
Hmm? Be you.

30:21.210 --> 30:24.300
Go in there with your head up,
because they don't get

30:24.344 --> 30:25.780
to determine who you are.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.435
Youdecide that.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.219
-Drink to that.
-ATHENA: Hey.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.655
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.092
[laughter]

30:33.135 --> 30:35.572
âª We gon' burn
the whole house down. âª

30:41.927 --> 30:44.799
[horn honking repeatedly]

30:53.634 --> 30:56.506
What the hell is this?

30:56.550 --> 30:59.031
I have something
to say to all of you.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.907
I see you.

31:05.951 --> 31:09.693
I saw you all the second
I walked in that door.

31:09.737 --> 31:12.131
All of you staring down at me.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.831
I see you when you're hazing me,

31:16.875 --> 31:19.225
notlike all the other rookies.

31:21.357 --> 31:24.273
Whether we're here in the house
or-or-or we're out on a call,

31:24.317 --> 31:26.928
I'm watching you,
I'm looking, I see you.

31:28.277 --> 31:30.627
When you look at me,
what do you see?

31:34.501 --> 31:36.459
A woman?

31:36.503 --> 31:38.418
A black woman?

31:40.637 --> 31:42.944
A lesbian?

31:42.988 --> 31:45.642
Good.

31:45.686 --> 31:49.124
'Cause I'm all of those things.

31:49.168 --> 31:51.692
And I don't expect you
to love me.

31:51.735 --> 31:55.696
I don't even ask you to like me.

31:55.739 --> 32:00.135
All I ask is
that when you look at me,

32:00.179 --> 32:02.398
see me.

32:02.442 --> 32:05.140
See me the way I see you--

32:05.184 --> 32:09.057
as a proud member
of this department.

32:09.101 --> 32:12.626
One of the rare few that chooses

32:12.669 --> 32:14.671
to spend their lives in service

32:14.715 --> 32:17.413
of those who are hurt
and those who need to be saved.

32:19.372 --> 32:22.027
Yes.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.943
And one other thing.

32:24.986 --> 32:30.339
If any of you have a problem
with me being here,

32:30.383 --> 32:34.865
I suggest you ask
for a transfer.

32:34.909 --> 32:38.130
'Cause I'm not going anywhere.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.088

Unknown injuries.

Saved by the bell.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.581
Let's go to work.

-Just called it in.
-Party limo, Captain.

-TOMMY: Roger that.

We're gonna get you out.

-There's five of us.
Please hurry.

indistinctly]

BOY:
It hurts.

33:49.462 --> 33:51.638
-BOY: Oh, God.
-It's okay, buddy. We got you.

33:51.681 --> 33:54.989
Five people, plus the driver.
Two conscious.

-Driver's deceased!
-Got it.

Hey.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.343
CHIMNEY:
What is that?

34:01.387 --> 34:02.866
Yellow paint.

34:02.910 --> 34:05.652
MAN:
We got one!

34:05.695 --> 34:07.523
[panting]

34:10.048 --> 34:11.397
MAN 2:
All right, easy.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.138
HEN:
What do you remember?

34:13.181 --> 34:15.662
One second,
Mark was lighting the bong.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.359
The next, we were upside down.

34:17.403 --> 34:18.882
[crying]:
We were just having a party.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.623
It was just a party.

34:21.842 --> 34:24.323
Apply pressure.

34:24.366 --> 34:26.760
-Try to breathe easy.
Breathe easy.
-Captain!

34:26.803 --> 34:28.892
Captain, I think there was
another vehicle

34:28.936 --> 34:31.591
-involved in the crash.
-What are you talking about?

34:31.634 --> 34:34.942
The bumper on the party limo
has yellow paint on it.

34:34.985 --> 34:37.423
-Yellow paint...
-CHIMNEY: She's right, Cap.
I saw it, too.

34:37.466 --> 34:38.685
It's all over the bumper.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.426
What if there was
another car here?

34:40.469 --> 34:42.384
It would explain why the limo
is so close to the road.

34:42.428 --> 34:45.692
-Maybe it hit something
before it flipped over.
-What does he say?

34:45.735 --> 34:47.737
-He doesn't remember anything.
-The only way to know for sure

34:47.781 --> 34:49.565
is if we go down there
and check.

34:49.609 --> 34:52.090
I'm not diverting resources
from a critical accident scene

34:52.133 --> 34:53.830
because you saw yellow paint.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.876
Your observation is duly noted.

34:55.919 --> 34:58.400
Now tend to your wounded.
That's an order!

35:00.533 --> 35:03.275
Hen! He'll have your job.

35:03.318 --> 35:06.234
If I don't do this,
I don't belong in this job.

35:11.370 --> 35:13.111
He's stable and ready to move.

35:18.072 --> 35:23.077
For the record, I thought
that was a pretty good speech.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.645
You know what pisses me off
about all this?

35:25.688 --> 35:28.952
-What?
-The rain.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.868
I had it ordered stopped
a half hour ago.

35:31.912 --> 35:35.655
I guess you got as much pull
around here as I do.

35:35.698 --> 35:38.310
More flowers.

35:38.353 --> 35:42.009
CHIMNEY: Great. We can use them
at our funeral.

35:42.052 --> 35:45.404
HEN: Flower vendor.
He probably finished up his day,

35:45.447 --> 35:47.710
was heading home, and got hit.

35:51.932 --> 35:54.674
Look, Howie, it's a shoe.

36:09.471 --> 36:12.387
Wilson!

36:12.431 --> 36:14.302
Here!

36:15.521 --> 36:18.828
I got him. I got him.

36:18.872 --> 36:21.570
-I got him.
-[Hen coughing]

36:30.275 --> 36:32.190
-No pulse.
-He's hypothermic.

He's not breathing.
Starting compressions.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.716

36:36.759 --> 36:39.197
This is EM-2 to unit 104.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.850
We have a male drowning victim,

36:40.894 --> 36:43.026
approximately eight
to ten years old.

36:43.070 --> 36:46.204
Location is approximately
80 to 100 yards southeast

36:46.247 --> 36:47.683

-Copy. Assistance on the way.

Come on.
Come on, baby, breathe.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.215

-Hold.

-Come on.
-Come on, sweetheart.

Sweetheart, breathe.
Breathe, sweetheart.

37:06.659 --> 37:08.487
Hold!

No pulse.

-Come on. Baby, please.
-Come on. Come on.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.276
Come on, sweetheart.
Sweetheart, breathe.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.582
Breathe, sweetheart.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.410
-Hold.
-Come on.

37:18.453 --> 37:20.586
I got a pulse.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.505
-[coughing]
-Good. Good. Keep breathing.

37:26.548 --> 37:29.812
[crying]: Keep breathing.
Keep breathing.

37:29.856 --> 37:32.075
-You did it.
-[crying, laughing]

37:32.119 --> 37:33.686
[gasping]

37:33.729 --> 37:36.297
Is this gonna be
a regular thing?

37:36.341 --> 37:37.907
The crying?

37:37.951 --> 37:40.780
[crying]:
It damn well could.

37:40.823 --> 37:44.262
'Cause now you got me going and
I don't know how to handle it.

37:44.305 --> 37:48.004
Please don't tell
the other guys, okay?

37:48.048 --> 37:49.745
[both laugh]

37:49.789 --> 37:52.705
-Good job, Wilson.
-[laughs]

37:52.748 --> 37:54.054
Okay.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.331
[Hen sighs]

38:16.598 --> 38:18.470
SAL:
Yo, Wilson.

38:22.778 --> 38:25.477
-Nice work yesterday.
-Yeah.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.782
We would have done a sweep
and found

38:26.826 --> 38:29.481
that second car eventually.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.831
But eventually
would have been too late.

38:31.874 --> 38:34.486
I just got lucky.

38:34.529 --> 38:35.487
SAL:
Screw that.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.358
You're good.

38:41.144 --> 38:42.711
[laughs]

38:44.539 --> 38:48.543
Hen, Captain wants to see you
in his office.

38:48.587 --> 38:51.154
[sighs]

38:53.505 --> 38:56.899
Well, it's been nice working
with you.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.988
Hey, you don't know what's gonna
happen in there.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.426
He hates me.

39:01.469 --> 39:04.167
Not because of how good
I do this job,

39:04.211 --> 39:06.996
just because of who I am.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.741
[thunder rumbles]

39:20.401 --> 39:22.316
[exhales]

39:36.722 --> 39:38.637
[knocks]

39:41.335 --> 39:42.510
Firefighter Wilson.

39:42.554 --> 39:44.425
I'm Commander Roose.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.166
I know who you are, sir.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.603
I remember you from the
brochures about recruitment.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.649
This is Captain Cooks.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.218
Since you've started
working here,

39:55.262 --> 39:56.437
we've received
numerous complaints.

39:56.481 --> 39:57.873
If I could just have a chance

39:57.917 --> 39:59.745
-to just-- to defend myself.
-Not about you.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.486
It's about Captain Gerrard.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.705
Wh-What?

40:03.749 --> 40:06.229
I-- no, I, I never filed
any complaints.

40:06.273 --> 40:08.406
COOKS: Not from you,
Firefighter Wilson,

40:08.449 --> 40:10.190
from your coworkers.

40:10.233 --> 40:12.497
What? Who?

40:12.540 --> 40:15.064
That information is privileged.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.763
But let's just say,

40:17.806 --> 40:21.680
more than a few of your
firefighters have your back.

40:21.723 --> 40:23.986
Some of the complaints
got pretty colorful.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.989
One of your coworkers
compared Captain Gerrard

40:27.033 --> 40:29.427
and his behavior
to a particular condition

40:29.470 --> 40:32.386
best cured by Preparation H.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.388
ROOSE: It's not just complaints
we're receiving.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.955
Your colleagues all have

40:35.998 --> 40:37.565
some pretty complimentary things
to say about you.

40:37.609 --> 40:41.003
You've made quite an impression.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.964
[laughs]

40:45.007 --> 40:46.444
I-I had no idea.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.054
I-I seriously thought
that you guys

40:48.097 --> 40:49.882
were bringing me in here to...

40:49.925 --> 40:53.015
to fire me.

40:53.059 --> 40:54.930
ROOSE:
Why would we do that?

40:54.974 --> 40:57.846
You're the future of the LAFD.

40:57.890 --> 41:02.460
Until we find Captain Gerrard's
permanent replacement,

41:02.503 --> 41:05.985
Captain Cooks here is going
to assume leadership of the 118.

41:08.944 --> 41:10.772
Welcome aboard, sir.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.688
You, too, Firefighter Wilson.

41:13.732 --> 41:17.736
-Hen.
-Hen.

41:29.835 --> 41:34.056
Did you know what was going on
in there before you sent me in?

41:34.100 --> 41:36.058
[laughs]

41:36.102 --> 41:37.930
You set me up.

41:37.973 --> 41:40.410
That's revenge for you making it
so hard to be friends with you.

41:40.454 --> 41:43.413
âª To fan the flame

41:43.457 --> 41:46.242
Thanks for sticking it out
with me.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.984
And thanks for following me
down that hillside.

41:49.028 --> 41:51.465
The first of many, I'm sure.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.336
-[alarm ringing]
-MAN: Attention, Station 118.

41:53.380 --> 41:54.860
Traffic accident with injuries.

41:54.903 --> 41:56.818
[continues indistinctly]

41:57.950 --> 42:00.518
âª Is it all

42:00.561 --> 42:03.303
âª So easy...

42:03.346 --> 42:05.958
HEN:
We are born with innocence.

42:06.001 --> 42:10.353
Then, as we grow, we are cursed
with a question: "Why?"

42:10.397 --> 42:12.399
Why are we here?

42:12.442 --> 42:16.011
Is it all just chaos,
or do we have a purpose?

42:16.055 --> 42:18.405
I was one of the lucky ones

42:18.448 --> 42:21.016
who found an answer
to that question.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.715
The curse was lifted
and replaced

42:23.758 --> 42:26.456
with the gift of certainty.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.763
Why am I here?

42:28.807 --> 42:31.113
Because when you are scared,
when you are hurt,

42:31.157 --> 42:33.028
and when you're in the wrong
place at the wrong time

42:33.072 --> 42:34.856
and the smoke is too thick
to breathe

42:34.900 --> 42:36.684
or it hurts too much to move

42:36.728 --> 42:39.600
or it looks like you might lose
someone you love,

42:39.644 --> 42:42.995
when it's your turn to have
the worst day of your life...

42:43.038 --> 42:44.997
âª It was all...

42:45.040 --> 42:48.827
...I am here to be
the first one there to help.

42:48.870 --> 42:53.614
I am here to stand between you
and the chaos.

42:53.658 --> 42:56.922
I am a first responder.

42:56.965 --> 42:58.576
That is my purpose.

42:58.619 --> 43:02.275
And I'm always just
a phone call away.

43:09.456 --> 43:13.373
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:44.926 --> 43:47.233
You've answered the call
on9-1-1.

43:47.276 --> 43:49.539
Now here are a few more shows to check out from Fox.

43:51.803 --> 43:53.021
Buckle up, buttercup.

43:55.371 --> 43:57.678
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

43:57.722 --> 44:01.290
-âª We're breaking waves
shooting starsâª
-[siren wailing]

44:01.334 --> 44:04.859
âª We live for glory
not foreverâª

44:04.903 --> 44:05.904
MAN: Touchdown!

44:05.947 --> 44:09.516
âª Reach outâª

44:09.559 --> 44:13.128
âª Make this right here
right nowâª

44:13.172 --> 44:16.088
âª Stand upâª

44:16.958 --> 44:18.699
âª Here right nowâª

44:18.743 --> 44:20.701
That sounds like fun.
