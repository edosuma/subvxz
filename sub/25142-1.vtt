01:43.125 --> 01:45.413
Scarcely
had the demon cast

01:45.415 --> 01:48.582
his burning stare upon her.

01:49.665 --> 01:50.957
Scarcely had...

01:52.082 --> 01:55.915
...the demon cast
his burning stare upon her...

01:57.040 --> 02:02.373
...leaving his face
entirely without symmetry...

02:02.375 --> 02:07.288
...leaving his face
entirely without form...

02:07.290 --> 02:11.080
...and as her fingertips
touched upon his lips,

02:11.082 --> 02:12.580
he melted into her.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.205
She's looking for you.

03:13.582 --> 03:15.955
Next time you run
off to read ghost stories,

03:15.957 --> 03:17.288
take me with you.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.913
Who says I was
reading ghost stories?

03:19.915 --> 03:21.663
It's thrilling, isn't it?

03:21.665 --> 03:23.455
My heart was racing,
I was so scared.

03:23.457 --> 03:24.498
If I were you,
I'd be more scared

03:24.500 --> 03:26.413
of your father
catching you reading it.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.290
I don't know how he vexes so.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.707
People liked his Gothic
novels.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.288
Your father
is in the bookshop working.

03:35.290 --> 03:38.330
Claire has been tending
to the house.

03:38.332 --> 03:40.457
I have spent all hours
going through the ledgers.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.830
Where were you today

03:42.832 --> 03:44.455
that you couldn't relieve
your father for a few hours?

03:44.457 --> 03:46.373
I completed my work
for today.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.707
I just went out
for some fresh air.

03:51.250 --> 03:52.582
I know where you were.

03:56.915 --> 03:59.082
Look who has returned,
my dear.

04:00.832 --> 04:02.375
I just went out for a walk.

04:10.457 --> 04:12.288
Glad to see you

04:12.290 --> 04:15.373
devoting yourself
to these great works, Mary.

04:18.958 --> 04:23.333
"To love reading is to have
everything within your reach."

04:27.833 --> 04:30.831
Payment is over-due, Mr.
Godwin.

04:30.833 --> 04:34.373
Need I remind you of the
conditions of your loan?

04:34.375 --> 04:36.083
Business has been very poor.

04:37.415 --> 04:39.873
Allow me one more month.

04:39.875 --> 04:42.081
Another month?
It's six months already.

04:42.083 --> 04:45.288
Now, weren't you asking
for a ghost story?

04:45.290 --> 04:46.498
Is it a new one?

04:46.500 --> 04:47.873
Another month. Understand?

04:56.375 --> 04:59.290
I will rise from the grave...

05:00.708 --> 05:04.500
...to tell the tale of the
treachery I have suffered.

05:07.790 --> 05:09.706
And to seek my revenge!

05:20.915 --> 05:24.456
Scarcely had the demon cast...

05:25.540 --> 05:28.832
...his burning stare
upon her...

05:29.583 --> 05:32.873
...in her icy cheeks...

05:38.125 --> 05:40.413
Claire, Claire. Claire!

05:40.415 --> 05:42.456
It's just a nightmare.

05:42.458 --> 05:43.875
It's all right.

05:45.415 --> 05:46.832
Go back to sleep.

05:47.708 --> 05:49.248
It's all right.

05:51.958 --> 05:53.458
Go back to sleep.

06:37.665 --> 06:38.788
You can't sleep?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.457
Do you miss her?

06:56.458 --> 06:58.500
She was so full of passion.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.500
So full of defiance.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.413
As if she were at war constantly

07:06.415 --> 07:08.163
with everyone and everything.

07:10.708 --> 07:13.083
And enjoying every moment
of the battle.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.873
Warriors like your mother are
never long for this world.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.333
The Devil's claws
lunged at the maiden's neck.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.665
Sinking his talons...

07:38.625 --> 07:42.706
...deep, deep into her ripe,
pale skin.

07:42.708 --> 07:47.581
Blood dripped...
like tracks in milky snow.

07:47.583 --> 07:48.538
Mary?

07:48.540 --> 07:50.163
She screamed.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.663
Where are you?

07:53.208 --> 07:54.831
No one watching the shop,

07:54.833 --> 07:58.206
and you back here
scribbling away like a child.

07:58.208 --> 07:59.498
Let's see what's so important

07:59.500 --> 08:01.538
that it's kept you
from your work, shall we?

08:01.540 --> 08:02.748
It is private.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.706
What thoughts
haunt the daughter

08:05.708 --> 08:07.288
of these esteemed writers?

08:07.290 --> 08:08.498
Let go!

08:12.625 --> 08:13.913
Mary.

08:13.915 --> 08:14.750
She pushed me!

08:15.583 --> 08:18.788
- Did you not see her-
- I didn't do anything.

08:18.790 --> 08:19.750
You all right?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.623
I can't live
with someone like this.

08:22.625 --> 08:24.913
There's not a grain
of respect in her.

08:24.915 --> 08:27.457
- I didn't do anything!
- That's enough. That's enough.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.621
He's an old friend.

08:35.624 --> 08:38.580
Mr. Baxter is as firm
a believer in education

08:38.582 --> 08:39.621
as I am.

08:39.624 --> 08:41.746
You'll find his house
very comfortable.

08:41.749 --> 08:42.582
Scotland?

08:44.249 --> 08:46.082
I'm sending you
away because I love you, Mary.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.039
And because I sincerely hope

08:49.041 --> 08:51.539
that you'll find the refuge
that you need there.

08:54.832 --> 08:57.039
Also that the solitude
will give you time

08:57.041 --> 08:58.666
for introspection.

08:59.791 --> 09:00.875
Your writing...

09:01.707 --> 09:04.330
...this is the work
of an imitator.

09:04.332 --> 09:06.748
Rid yourself of
the thoughts and words

09:06.750 --> 09:08.832
of other people, Mary.

09:10.582 --> 09:12.080
Find your own voice.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.789
Mary! Welcome.

09:52.791 --> 09:55.539
Oh, my God, you look so much
like your mother.

09:55.541 --> 09:57.080
And, thank the Lord,
not a thing like your father.

09:57.082 --> 10:00.873
I'm William Baxter.
This is my daughter Isabel.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.705
We'll do our best to keep you
amused out here, Mary.

10:03.707 --> 10:05.623
It may not be
as bustling as London,

10:05.625 --> 10:08.375
but I'm sure we can find
some ways to pass the time.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.123
The night is so different here.

10:28.125 --> 10:31.873
How do people sleep
with all this silence?

10:31.875 --> 10:34.416
Come on, I know
just where to go.

10:39.125 --> 10:42.414
I've thought of trying
to summon my mother...

10:42.416 --> 10:43.580
...by sÃ©ance.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.707
But she suffered so long
with illness...

10:49.750 --> 10:52.291
...what if she has finally
found peace at last?

10:53.500 --> 10:55.457
Wouldn't it be cruel
to disturb her?

10:57.207 --> 10:59.455
Do you think
it could really work,

10:59.457 --> 11:00.955
reaching the dead?

11:02.416 --> 11:04.291
I already feel her presence.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.916
I miss her so much.

11:09.791 --> 11:11.833
Not a day goes by
when I don't think of her.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.375
Would you ever consider
trying to contact your mother?

11:20.916 --> 11:22.833
Maybe she wouldn't
want me to.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.166
Given I was the one
who killed her.

11:28.875 --> 11:31.416
She died just days
after I was born.

11:34.541 --> 11:35.583
Oh, Mary.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.791
I love it in Scotland.

11:59.832 --> 12:01.789
Nothing is as I expected
it would be.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.998
You've only been here
a few weeks.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.291
Give it time.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.998
In London it's not often
we have occasion

12:09.000 --> 12:11.205
to picnic by the river.

12:11.207 --> 12:14.289
Your mistake is waiting
for an occasion.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.789
I looked upon
the rotting sea And drew my eyes away

12:32.791 --> 12:36.330
I looked upon the rotting deck
And there the dead men lay

12:36.332 --> 12:39.664
I looked to Heaven
and tried to pray

12:39.666 --> 12:42.248
But before a prayer had gushed
A wicked whisper came...

12:42.250 --> 12:44.914
Come in. Come in.
You must be freezing.

12:44.916 --> 12:47.205
If I could just give you
a couple of my essays.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.539
My contribution to this
evening's entertainment.

12:50.541 --> 12:52.039
- How are you?
- Good. How's the party?

12:52.041 --> 12:54.958
Isabel... who is that?

12:56.125 --> 12:58.582
Oh, that's Shelley.

12:59.416 --> 13:01.330
Beautiful, isn't he?

13:01.332 --> 13:02.330
He's a radical poet.

13:02.332 --> 13:04.289
He thinks poetry
should reform society,

13:04.291 --> 13:05.830
and so he's often in trouble.

13:05.832 --> 13:07.914
Sounds like quite a catch.

13:07.916 --> 13:10.080
Come, let me introduce you
to some friends.

13:10.082 --> 13:11.873
There is someone
I would like you to meet.

13:11.875 --> 13:12.957
Good luck.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.373
Percy, may I present Mary.
Mary-

13:16.375 --> 13:17.914
Baxter! Come and join us!

13:17.916 --> 13:19.914
Oh, it's Coleridge.

13:19.916 --> 13:21.955
Mary, could you put
these nameplates out, please?

13:25.957 --> 13:27.500
Let me get those for you.

13:30.082 --> 13:32.457
I'm Percy Bysshe Shelley.

13:34.125 --> 13:36.789
I am
Mary Wollstonecraft-Godwin.

13:36.791 --> 13:38.123
Of course.

13:38.125 --> 13:40.582
Baxter mentioned you'd
be joining the family here.

13:41.832 --> 13:45.582
I am a great admirer
of both your parents' work.

13:51.957 --> 13:55.039
I hope I can entrust you
to this task, Mr. Shelley.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.080
Or will you try to incite me
to revolution?

13:57.082 --> 13:59.914
My reputation precedes me.

13:59.916 --> 14:03.164
Won't you welcome a change
from the deafening quiet?

14:03.166 --> 14:04.708
I've grown accustomed to it.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.123
In London I spend most of my
time in my father's bookshop.

14:10.125 --> 14:13.580
So the deafening quiet is not
as dramatic as you may think.

14:13.582 --> 14:15.539
Baxter does his best
for these gatherings.

14:15.541 --> 14:19.205
Any lover of poetry will surely
find a great thrill in the work

14:19.207 --> 14:21.040
that is being presented here.

14:23.041 --> 14:26.500
So surely
you are a writer yourself?

14:28.125 --> 14:29.539
Not really.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.166
Nothing substantial.

14:31.916 --> 14:34.580
I hope to, someday.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.080
And what, may I ask,
would you constitute

14:36.082 --> 14:38.250
as "substantial" in your eyes?

14:40.166 --> 14:43.039
Anything that curdles the blood

14:43.041 --> 14:45.750
and quickens the beatings
of the heart.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.164
Ah, perfect!

14:50.166 --> 14:53.789
Now may I
steal Mr. Shelley away?

14:53.791 --> 14:55.414
We would love a poem, sir.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.958
Certainly, sir.

14:59.082 --> 15:04.040
Without an audience, ideas
remain mere words on a page.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.914
Mr. Shelley, your essay.

15:09.916 --> 15:13.205
Oh, I have no need for those.
Thank you.

15:13.207 --> 15:16.330
I shall trust in the spark
of new found inspiration.

15:29.625 --> 15:33.664
Oh, not the visioned poet
in his dreams

15:33.666 --> 15:37.873
When silvery clouds float
through the wildered brain

15:37.875 --> 15:43.205
When every sight of lovely,
wild and grand

15:43.207 --> 15:44.914
Astonishes

15:44.916 --> 15:46.830
Enraptures

15:46.832 --> 15:48.332
Elevates

15:49.457 --> 15:51.248
So bright...

15:51.250 --> 15:54.205
...so fair, so wild a shape

15:54.207 --> 15:55.998
Hath ever yet beheld

15:56.000 --> 15:58.330
As that which reined
the coursers of the air

15:58.332 --> 16:01.998
And poured the magic
of her gaze

16:02.000 --> 16:04.082
Upon the maiden's sleep

16:34.000 --> 16:35.873
Alone, alone

16:35.875 --> 16:37.664
All alone

16:37.666 --> 16:40.205
Upon the wide, wide sea

16:40.207 --> 16:44.414
And God will not take pity
on my soul in agony

16:47.125 --> 16:50.248
- This weather.
- Ah, stop complaining.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.205
It's Scotland,
what do you expect?

16:52.207 --> 16:55.205
So I say to you, if all
things come from God...

16:55.207 --> 16:56.539
...and we all come from God,

16:56.541 --> 16:58.580
are we not part of God?

16:58.582 --> 17:01.998
When we think, do we not
behold the very thoughts of God?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.748
Can't say I feel like
much of a god.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.247
Your body is tired, Baxter,

17:05.249 --> 17:07.708
but your spirit,
it longs to soar.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.583
What of you, Miss Godwin?

17:12.208 --> 17:14.580
Do you think you are of God...

17:14.583 --> 17:16.913
...like the great
poet Coleridge?

17:19.249 --> 17:20.040
I'll admit...

17:21.374 --> 17:23.455
...I thought Coleridge
was much more captivating

17:23.458 --> 17:25.165
when I was a child.

17:25.540 --> 17:26.580
There you go.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.748
I'm surprised you can
remember back that far.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.706
Behold the
majesty of God's creation...

17:30.708 --> 17:33.123
Well just how old are you then,

17:33.125 --> 17:35.288
dear ancient one?

17:35.290 --> 17:37.248
Old enough to know
why you are asking.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.623
Ah.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.831
It's inspirational,
don't you think?

17:40.833 --> 17:43.081
- I'm 16.
- Hmm.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.788
How about you?

17:44.790 --> 17:46.290
21.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.206
A wise old man indeed.

17:54.958 --> 17:58.331
As mountain
springs under the morning sun

17:58.333 --> 18:00.663
We shall become the same

18:00.665 --> 18:04.413
We shall be one spirit
within two frames

18:04.415 --> 18:07.373
Oh, wherefore two?

18:07.375 --> 18:10.581
One passion in twin hearts
which grows and grew

18:10.583 --> 18:13.373
Till like two meteors
of expanding flame

18:13.375 --> 18:17.373
Those spheres instinct
with it become the same

18:17.375 --> 18:19.038
Touch, mingle

18:19.040 --> 18:20.706
Are transfigured ever still

18:21.790 --> 18:24.706
Burning, yet inconsumable

18:32.875 --> 18:34.208
Mary...

18:35.415 --> 18:38.207
...I'm afraid I have some
terrible news from London.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.583
It's your sister Claire.

18:46.165 --> 18:48.038
May I ask you...

18:48.040 --> 18:50.625
...could you tell Mr. Shelley
I said goodbye?

18:52.208 --> 18:53.788
Of course.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.373
Was Scotland everything
I said it would be?

19:15.375 --> 19:16.540
Were you happy?

19:17.125 --> 19:18.625
I was.

19:21.915 --> 19:24.956
You will live again, Mary.
You have your mother's spirit.

19:24.958 --> 19:26.875
You won't be confined for long.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.665
She's been like this for weeks.

19:55.415 --> 19:56.750
Claire?

19:58.208 --> 20:01.208
Thank God!
You're finally back!

20:06.040 --> 20:07.875
So you aren't dying?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.291
Only from boredom.

20:13.125 --> 20:15.250
You mean you weren't sick
at all?

20:16.875 --> 20:19.790
Well... maybe a little bit.

20:30.958 --> 20:33.331
Poor captive bird!

20:33.333 --> 20:35.163
Who, from thy narrow cage

20:35.165 --> 20:37.706
Pourest such music,
that it might assuage

20:37.708 --> 20:41.623
The rugged hearts of those
who prisoned thee

20:41.625 --> 20:44.663
Were they not deaf towards
sweet melody

20:44.665 --> 20:48.998
This song shall be thy rose,
its petals pale

20:49.000 --> 20:51.998
Are dead, indeed,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.498
my adored Nightingale!

21:01.458 --> 21:03.748
It seems my mother's
latest reverie

21:03.750 --> 21:06.373
is a young protÃ©gÃ©
for your father.

21:06.375 --> 21:07.913
We are all to be
on our best behavior

21:07.915 --> 21:10.413
at dinner tonight
to win him over.

21:10.415 --> 21:12.415
He's wealthy, evidently.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.706
She's a woman
of indomitable hope,

21:15.708 --> 21:17.458
I can't deny her that.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.081
Mr. Percy Shelley,

21:28.083 --> 21:32.373
may I present Mrs. Godwin,
my wife.

21:32.375 --> 21:37.581
And our children,
William, Claire and Mary.

21:37.583 --> 21:38.958
Delighted.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.498
My husband tells me
you're a poet, Mr Shelley.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.873
He speaks very highly
of your work.

21:45.875 --> 21:49.373
Well, I am humbled
by his praise, Mrs. Godwin.

21:49.375 --> 21:52.663
I must admit, though, my work
is not yet widely known.

21:52.665 --> 21:55.288
Although I have just completed
my second volume which...

21:55.290 --> 21:56.706
...awaits publication.

21:56.708 --> 21:59.373
Very impressive
achievement for such a young man.

21:59.375 --> 22:01.538
Any achievement of
mine falls within the shadow

22:01.540 --> 22:03.123
of your influence, Mr. Godwin.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.248
You flatter me.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.038
Hope you will
consider my proposal

22:06.040 --> 22:07.956
to take me on as your protÃ©gÃ©.

22:07.958 --> 22:11.413
I have a considerable allowance
at my disposal...

22:11.415 --> 22:16.038
...and would gladly reimburse you
for any time you might spare.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.748
Well, I feel duty bound to...

22:19.750 --> 22:23.540
...foster such ability.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.250
Well then, that's settled.

22:28.250 --> 22:29.498
How fortunate we are

22:29.500 --> 22:32.333
to be in the presence
of two great minds.

22:33.625 --> 22:36.663
You must see
our bookshop, Mr. Shelley.

22:36.665 --> 22:40.331
I have a copy of "The
Iliad" in the original Greek.

22:40.333 --> 22:41.581
Hmm.

22:41.583 --> 22:44.000
Perhaps Mary will show it
to you after dinner.

22:47.875 --> 22:49.250
How are you here?

22:50.500 --> 22:53.248
Does it seem so strange that
I would seek out the tutelage

22:53.250 --> 22:55.000
of the great William Godwin?

22:57.500 --> 23:00.415
Clearly I'm not only here
to see your father.

23:01.540 --> 23:03.457
Then why are you here?

23:05.790 --> 23:09.288
To once again feel
the curdling of my blood

23:09.290 --> 23:12.500
and the quickening of the
beatings of my heart.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.000
Mary?

23:18.915 --> 23:20.500
Mr. Shelley?

23:21.790 --> 23:24.540
Your father would like
to see Mr. Shelley.

23:26.665 --> 23:27.665
Thank you.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.081
I will be with him momentarily.

23:30.083 --> 23:34.083
I'm quite enjoying the,
uh, collection.

23:35.583 --> 23:36.625
So I see.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.831
As I was saying,

23:42.833 --> 23:46.498
both your parents are a great
source of inspiration to me.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.750
My mother died
when I was ten days old.

23:49.625 --> 23:51.708
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

23:52.915 --> 23:54.581
Don't be sorry.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.291
I love to talk about her.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.415
Even if I never truly knew her.

24:00.665 --> 24:04.413
All of the contradictions
she embodied.

24:04.415 --> 24:06.125
All anyone ever talks about...

24:06.875 --> 24:09.498
...now is how she wanted
to go off

24:09.500 --> 24:12.831
and live with a married man
and his wife...

24:12.833 --> 24:14.541
...in a mÃ©nage Ã  trois.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.625
And what do you think about...

24:17.583 --> 24:19.081
...all that?

24:19.083 --> 24:20.791
I have no problem with it.

24:22.458 --> 24:24.791
People should live and love
as they wish.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.748
But one thing I've never
understood is...

24:28.750 --> 24:31.538
...why did two radicals
such as your parents

24:31.540 --> 24:33.206
succumb to marriage?

24:33.208 --> 24:35.375
To legitimize me.

24:39.665 --> 24:40.665
Meet me...

24:41.583 --> 24:42.583
...tomorrow.

24:43.708 --> 24:44.666
Just tell me where.

24:48.708 --> 24:50.500
There is a place I go alone.

24:52.583 --> 24:54.748
I'm not sure
what you'll make of it.

24:57.250 --> 24:59.333
My sanctuary of sorts.

25:01.665 --> 25:04.163
Then it will
be my sanctuary, too.

25:17.915 --> 25:19.582
I come here whenever I can.

25:21.290 --> 25:23.290
Just to feel her embrace.

25:26.540 --> 25:28.581
My father taught me to read...

25:28.583 --> 25:30.831
...by tracing the letters
of her name.

25:35.208 --> 25:37.541
I don't know what it is
I'm waiting for here.

25:38.790 --> 25:42.540
Maybe you're just waiting
for someone to reach out and...

25:43.833 --> 25:45.788
...return your embrace.

25:54.833 --> 25:56.583
I thought we would never
escape the rain.

25:58.250 --> 26:01.663
I think I'd rather suffer
the deluge outside.

26:01.665 --> 26:03.538
If God is everywhere,

26:03.540 --> 26:06.373
then why must Man
erect temples to Him?

26:06.375 --> 26:08.163
Because it is your imagination

26:08.165 --> 26:10.206
that is the instrument
of moral good,

26:10.208 --> 26:12.375
not these four walls.

26:15.958 --> 26:18.748
Let's see if the Great Creator
strikes us down.

26:22.790 --> 26:27.498
You shall fear
the Lord your God.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.663
Thrones, altars...

26:29.665 --> 26:31.373
...judgement seats,
and prisons,

26:31.375 --> 26:35.748
they are all part of one
gigantic, despotic system...

26:35.750 --> 26:39.833
...designed to crush
the soul of Man.

26:41.333 --> 26:44.163
Their empty covenant
has no power over us.

26:47.415 --> 26:49.538
I fear not of God,

26:49.540 --> 26:51.288
or His henchmen on Earth.

26:51.290 --> 26:52.625
Hmm.

26:56.458 --> 26:57.873
Someone's here.

26:59.875 --> 27:01.663
Percy.

27:01.665 --> 27:02.707
Percy.

27:04.625 --> 27:07.083
So the Judgement
Day is upon us already.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.125
Hello?

27:13.250 --> 27:14.665
Is anyone there?

27:50.750 --> 27:54.331
Oh, Mr. Shelley,
it is a real book.

27:54.333 --> 27:58.581
Your name looks so good
in that gold typeface.

27:58.583 --> 27:59.748
I'm sure it will be
more popular

27:59.750 --> 28:02.165
than your treatise
on the virtues of atheism.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.748
Ghost stories and romance
novels might sell, my dear,

28:05.750 --> 28:07.373
but it's books that
challenge the common doctrine

28:07.375 --> 28:10.873
and superstition
that will truly endure.

28:10.875 --> 28:13.663
We rely on brave works
like this

28:13.665 --> 28:16.498
to push the world out of
its misery and delusion.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.833
Well done, sir.

28:18.790 --> 28:20.832
I hope you like it,
Miss Godwin.

28:22.790 --> 28:24.457
I'm sure I will.

28:33.415 --> 28:34.957
Read it when you're alone.

28:49.165 --> 28:51.038
Oh, give it to me!

28:51.040 --> 28:52.913
Give it to me.
Please, Mary.

28:52.915 --> 28:54.415
Mary.

28:55.708 --> 28:58.498
"The sunlight clasp the Earth

28:58.500 --> 29:00.998
And the moonbeams
kiss the sea

29:01.000 --> 29:03.288
What are
all these kissings worth..."

29:03.290 --> 29:05.290
"If thou kiss not me?"

29:06.583 --> 29:07.791
Miss Godwin?

29:08.583 --> 29:09.706
Yes?

29:11.500 --> 29:15.248
I am Mrs. Shelley.
Harriet Shelley.

29:15.250 --> 29:18.956
And this is Ianthe,
our daughter.

29:24.875 --> 29:28.498
How can I help you,
Mrs. Shelley?

29:28.500 --> 29:30.625
I am searching for my husband.

29:33.583 --> 29:34.833
He's not here.

29:35.790 --> 29:37.875
My father works alone today.

29:38.875 --> 29:41.123
I cannot help you any further.

29:41.125 --> 29:42.665
Miss Godwin!

29:45.750 --> 29:47.415
Stay away from Percy.

29:50.165 --> 29:54.998
I have not seen him in weeks
but I have heard rumors.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.248
Surely a wife of Mr. Shelley
would be impervious to gossip?

29:59.250 --> 30:02.958
Evidently you are a stranger
to scandal, Miss Godwin.

30:05.583 --> 30:08.708
Did you know I ran away
with Percy when I was a girl?

30:10.375 --> 30:13.625
Idealism and love
give us courage.

30:14.915 --> 30:16.831
But they do not prepare you
for the sacrifice

30:16.833 --> 30:19.250
required to love a man
like Percy.

30:22.208 --> 30:25.831
Your husband
is my father's student.

30:25.833 --> 30:27.000
Nothing more.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.288
If I see Mr. Shelley,

30:29.290 --> 30:31.250
I will let him know
you are looking for him.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.500
Goodbye, Mrs. Shelley.

30:48.083 --> 30:49.625
Claire?

31:04.290 --> 31:06.250
Your wife is very pretty,
Mr. Shelley.

31:07.125 --> 31:08.958
I didn't know you were married.

31:10.625 --> 31:11.750
Yes.

31:14.208 --> 31:17.291
Yes, I've been married
for five years now.

31:18.625 --> 31:20.040
Well, well.

31:21.540 --> 31:23.250
We look forward
to meeting Mrs. Shelley.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.038
Perhaps she would like to
join us for dinner one evening?

31:27.040 --> 31:29.163
Your offer is
most kind, Mrs. Godwin.

31:29.165 --> 31:32.706
However, Mrs. Shelley and I
are man and wife in name...

31:32.708 --> 31:33.956
...only.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.623
I continue to provide
for Harriet

31:35.625 --> 31:39.038
and my daughter Ianthe
financially but that is all.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.498
It is an intolerable tyranny...

31:41.500 --> 31:44.873
...to bind husband and wife
to cohabitation

31:44.875 --> 31:47.915
after the decay
of their affection.

31:49.750 --> 31:50.790
Yeah.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.875
I remember saying something
like that when I was young.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.998
How could you do such a thing?

32:05.000 --> 32:08.123
- What did I do?
- You told her.

32:08.125 --> 32:09.915
I had to.

32:23.415 --> 32:26.538
How could you not speak
of Harriet and Ianthe?

32:26.540 --> 32:28.206
My marriage was a mistake.

32:28.208 --> 32:31.373
I believed that I'd found
in Harriet a kindred spirit.

32:31.375 --> 32:33.998
But time revealed only
an empty, heartless cynicism

32:34.000 --> 32:38.373
that consumed the both of us
in a spiral of hate and anguish.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.375
But when I met you...

32:40.833 --> 32:44.038
...for the first time since
my marriage, I felt alive.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.538
And had you known
I was married,

32:46.540 --> 32:48.373
propriety would have gotten
the better of you.

32:48.375 --> 32:50.206
Propriety has never
been a concern of mine.

32:50.208 --> 32:51.956
I promise you it can
be very easy to say that,

32:51.958 --> 32:54.873
but it can be very different
to live it.

32:54.875 --> 32:56.123
Which is what I challenge you
to do now.

32:56.125 --> 32:57.498
You challenge me to what?

32:57.500 --> 32:58.706
- To do what-
- Shh!

32:58.708 --> 33:01.413
To do what your heart
is telling you to do

33:01.415 --> 33:03.873
and to come away with me.

33:03.875 --> 33:05.790
And let us both find...

33:07.250 --> 33:10.206
...new air to fill our lungs.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.750
A new sun to warm our faces.

33:16.875 --> 33:23.081
See a new life that is
actually worth the living...

33:23.083 --> 33:24.333
...together.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.913
The air in this
house was stifling

33:37.915 --> 33:40.163
long before Shelley,

33:40.165 --> 33:42.163
but the fact
that he comes here every day

33:42.165 --> 33:44.288
makes it even less bearable.

33:46.583 --> 33:48.625
Feels like I'm suffocating.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.208
I just want to get away.

33:55.290 --> 33:57.125
At least you went to Scotland.

33:57.958 --> 33:59.583
I've never been anywhere.

34:03.165 --> 34:05.625
Next time we'll
go somewhere together.

34:08.041 --> 34:10.496
We'll set off around the world,

34:10.498 --> 34:12.123
just you and me.

34:13.666 --> 34:16.539
And we'll meet amazing people

34:16.541 --> 34:18.833
and go to wonderful places.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.706
And none of this,

34:21.708 --> 34:24.748
or any of these people,
will matter at all.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.291
They won't mean a thing.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.791
I promise.

34:32.748 --> 34:35.748
I can't imagine anything
more wonderful.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.164
Done so soon, Mr. Shelley?

34:46.166 --> 34:47.956
I thought you and Mr. Godwin
would be working

34:47.958 --> 34:49.746
through the afternoon.

34:49.748 --> 34:51.871
I'm afraid I don't feel up
to much of anything today,

34:51.873 --> 34:53.331
Mrs. Godwin.

35:04.833 --> 35:06.206
Mr. Shelley seems
to be suffering

35:06.208 --> 35:08.708
from some sort of
emotional anguish.

35:10.833 --> 35:13.456
Perhaps he was disappointed
to find that...

35:13.458 --> 35:16.206
...you do not cultivate the
same public feats of wantonness

35:16.208 --> 35:18.291
as your dear departed mother.

35:19.541 --> 35:22.956
I would ask that you not
speak ill of my mother.

35:22.958 --> 35:24.291
Oh, but of course.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.873
How dare anyone utter one
word out of turn

35:27.875 --> 35:30.375
about a deceased person
of such eminent merit?

35:31.750 --> 35:35.206
At least you have not inherited
that strange deficit of hers.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.414
That foolish impulsiveness

35:36.416 --> 35:38.916
which mistook wretchedness
with emancipation.

35:40.250 --> 35:44.206
I have inherited nothing
but a fire in my soul

35:44.208 --> 35:46.331
and I will no longer allow you,

35:46.333 --> 35:48.456
or anyone else, to contain it.

35:48.458 --> 35:51.456
Are you really involved
with that whoremonger?

35:51.458 --> 35:54.289
I hope those rumors
prove to be false.

35:54.291 --> 35:56.914
Just when we have found
an avenue for our salvation,

35:56.916 --> 36:00.331
you go and turn our fortunes
into yet another scandal.

36:00.333 --> 36:03.831
Do you believe I care at all
for my reputation?

36:03.833 --> 36:05.414
Or yours?

36:05.416 --> 36:08.873
I fear nothing but letting
your meaningless words

36:08.875 --> 36:11.541
scare me away from my desires.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.831
The sunlight clasps the Earth

36:36.833 --> 36:40.581
And the moonbeams
kiss the sea

36:40.583 --> 36:43.206
What are
all these kissings worth

36:43.208 --> 36:46.166
If thou kiss not me?

36:59.416 --> 37:00.291
Mary.

37:17.833 --> 37:20.456
What do you mean?
But you're already married.

37:20.458 --> 37:21.708
We love each other.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.456
We don't need to be married.

37:24.458 --> 37:25.539
I told you your warped ideals

37:25.541 --> 37:26.623
would come back to haunt us.

37:26.625 --> 37:27.873
Mrs. Godwin, please.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.331
We are only living
by your beliefs.

37:30.333 --> 37:31.998
- Your principles.
- What do you know of living your beliefs?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.331
You had no problem
with my mother

37:33.333 --> 37:34.539
wanting to live
out of wedlock.

37:34.541 --> 37:35.873
Do you really think

37:35.875 --> 37:38.166
you can withstand
the consequences of this?

37:39.125 --> 37:42.708
Your mother was tortured
by her impulses.

37:44.166 --> 37:46.498
The very passions she thought
were holding her together

37:46.500 --> 37:51.331
were working just as
diligently to tear her apart.

37:51.333 --> 37:54.248
Don't let them get the better
of you, Mary.

37:54.250 --> 37:57.206
And you forget whatever fantasy
you've woven with my daughter.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.414
Are you really suggesting

37:58.416 --> 38:01.956
I could only be with your
daughter if we were married?

38:01.958 --> 38:03.373
How dare you?

38:03.375 --> 38:05.664
Come into my house,
you accept my hospitality

38:05.666 --> 38:07.956
and seduce
my 16 year old daughter!

38:07.958 --> 38:09.498
Is it not you
accepting my money?

38:09.500 --> 38:10.708
Go back to your wife!

38:11.833 --> 38:14.456
Never set foot
in this house again.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.081
My love, I will return for you.

38:19.875 --> 38:23.789
If you ever
see Mr. Shelley again,

38:23.791 --> 38:27.000
prepare to lose the love
of a father, forever.

38:45.916 --> 38:46.750
Mary!

38:49.958 --> 38:51.333
Mary!

38:53.000 --> 38:54.748
Don't look back, Mary.

38:54.750 --> 38:57.458
Remember, once you are gone...

38:58.250 --> 38:59.748
...none of this,

38:59.750 --> 39:02.708
or any of these people,
will matter at all.

39:04.458 --> 39:07.291
But please, Mary,
take me with you.

39:08.250 --> 39:10.916
You promised next time
we would go together.

39:33.625 --> 39:35.664
I hope I haven't kept you
waiting long!

39:46.666 --> 39:48.498
I guess you come as a pair.

39:48.500 --> 39:50.456
I couldn't leave her.

39:50.458 --> 39:51.873
Come!

39:51.875 --> 39:53.039
Where are we going?

39:53.041 --> 39:54.789
To St. Pancras.

40:06.500 --> 40:07.625
Ladies.

40:10.125 --> 40:11.706
It's down here.

40:17.833 --> 40:18.833
Thank you.

40:20.541 --> 40:21.373
Oh!

40:24.125 --> 40:27.289
It is temporary, of course.

40:27.291 --> 40:29.083
Well, where will I sleep?

40:30.625 --> 40:32.456
Try through there.

40:38.750 --> 40:40.666
I am going to find us
a house...

40:41.666 --> 40:44.500
...and I intend it
to be perfect.

40:45.458 --> 40:47.250
It already is perfect.

40:48.625 --> 40:49.708
I have you.

40:51.416 --> 40:54.041
Wherever we're together
is where I belong.

41:05.625 --> 41:07.458
Are you sure, Mary?

41:08.708 --> 41:10.958
Only if you are ready,
my love.

41:38.916 --> 41:41.498
I'm free
to write what I please.

41:41.500 --> 41:42.789
Like a torrent of light

41:42.791 --> 41:44.664
poured into a dark world.

41:44.666 --> 41:47.664
All around me I see bliss,

41:47.666 --> 41:49.373
'cause I now know what it is
to love...

41:49.375 --> 41:50.414
Its very essence is liberty.

41:50.416 --> 41:52.581
...and be loved.

41:52.583 --> 41:54.748
It is comparable
neither with obedience, jealousy nor fear.

41:54.750 --> 41:59.748
It is there, most pure,
perfect and unlimited.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.623
...close round the dying girl.

42:04.500 --> 42:08.539
Out and in they hurry and spin

42:08.541 --> 42:12.414
and dance, through the dance.

42:12.416 --> 42:16.748
They dance
through the weary Whirl.

42:16.750 --> 42:19.998
Patience, patience,
though my heart is breaking.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.581
God, there is no
question-making

42:22.583 --> 42:26.414
of thy body thou art
quit and free.

42:26.416 --> 42:31.041
Heaven keep thy soul eternally!

42:36.083 --> 42:38.666
I trust you've enjoyed
the last of the claret?

42:43.083 --> 42:47.041
Would it be unwise to ask how
it went today?

42:49.416 --> 42:50.875
My publishers are fools.

42:53.791 --> 42:55.623
Don't let them upset you.

42:55.625 --> 42:57.873
They're not worth it.

42:57.875 --> 43:00.083
But their advance is worth
everything, Mary.

43:04.958 --> 43:06.625
My father has cut me off.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.998
He says I've disgraced
his name

43:10.000 --> 43:15.873
because of the scandal
that surrounds us.

43:15.875 --> 43:16.666
So now you know.

43:37.166 --> 43:39.500
This one. Is
that of any interest?

43:40.625 --> 43:41.416
No?

43:42.666 --> 43:44.750
Not interested in those.
What else do you have?

43:46.833 --> 43:49.498
Well, 'Iliad' by Homer
in the original Greek.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.333
Father?

43:52.291 --> 43:53.583
It's been weeks.

43:58.791 --> 43:59.791
You're selling it?

44:00.875 --> 44:03.206
Yes. There comes a time
when we all

44:03.208 --> 44:06.250
have to let go of the
things we hold dear.

44:16.166 --> 44:20.039
It's your decision, Mary,
and you must live with it.

44:20.041 --> 44:22.833
He claims to love humanity
yet forsakes his child.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.791
I wish nothing more than that
you should thrive.

44:30.791 --> 44:33.041
But, look at you.

44:37.166 --> 44:40.041
So, do you want to sell it?

44:45.125 --> 44:46.458
No.

45:00.708 --> 45:02.081
Erasmus Darwin once wrote...

45:02.083 --> 45:03.789
Who is Erasmus Darwin?

45:03.791 --> 45:05.873
A poet and a physician.

45:05.875 --> 45:08.833
He once wrote that a man who has never
tried an experiment in his life is a fool.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.414
...on my sister's cat.

45:19.416 --> 45:21.248
Oh Shelley, you didn't!

45:21.250 --> 45:24.373
No, I didn't. I have
the claw marks to prove it.

45:26.791 --> 45:27.791
What's going on?

45:28.875 --> 45:30.539
I remembered a debt unpaid.

45:30.541 --> 45:32.748
I know how much
you love science, Mary.

45:32.750 --> 45:34.581
Watch this.

45:39.958 --> 45:41.041
This is incredible.

45:43.333 --> 45:45.539
And this is for you.

45:45.541 --> 45:47.416
Shelley.

45:50.583 --> 45:52.748
You shouldn't have spent
money on dresses.

45:52.750 --> 45:56.331
Don't be silly, Mary,
it's beautiful.

45:56.333 --> 45:57.873
That is not all.

45:57.875 --> 46:02.831
Tomorrow we move to our
new house in Bloomsbury.

46:02.833 --> 46:06.081
- The servants will meet us there.
- Servants!

46:06.083 --> 46:08.748
Because how can we write if
we are forced to tend

46:08.750 --> 46:10.873
to such domestic mundanities

46:10.875 --> 46:12.458
as the shopping
and the cleaning.

46:13.958 --> 46:16.875
You make everything
seem possible.

46:25.625 --> 46:29.831
- It's a step up from St. Pancras.
- Welcome home, Mary.

46:29.833 --> 46:31.331
Stop.

46:33.958 --> 46:34.875
Wait for me!

46:36.000 --> 46:37.125
Come on.

46:59.291 --> 47:00.833
A day
devoted to love and idleness

47:02.750 --> 47:07.998
but despite my earthly paradise I
feel a frustration born of guilt.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.208
A constant whisper that I am no
closer to achieving my dreams.

47:13.750 --> 47:14.583
Excuse me,

47:15.458 --> 47:16.791
are you the poet Shelley?

47:18.125 --> 47:20.914
Yes. Yes, I am.

47:20.916 --> 47:24.123
- Would you sign my pocketbook?
- Of course.

47:24.125 --> 47:25.375
Our friends will be
terribly jealous.

47:27.041 --> 47:27.916
There.

47:30.125 --> 47:31.000
Well, have a good day.

47:33.833 --> 47:36.041
My love, I have news.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.291
Oh, my Mary. Hey, a baby.

47:45.000 --> 47:45.958
What news!

47:46.833 --> 47:48.291
- You're happy?
- Of course I'm happy.

47:49.875 --> 47:50.958
Why? Aren't you?

47:53.500 --> 47:57.248
I've never had a mother.
What if I fail?

47:57.250 --> 47:59.208
You think we can only learn
by example?

48:00.666 --> 48:05.289
What of pure instinct? Of the
inherent good that lies in all of us?

48:05.291 --> 48:08.498
And that, my darling,
you have in abundance.

48:08.500 --> 48:11.498
- As will our little girl.
- You think it's a girl?

48:11.500 --> 48:14.041
She will be our
very own prodigy.

48:15.125 --> 48:16.250
Ianthe, come here.

48:18.208 --> 48:19.250
Good girl.

48:32.583 --> 48:33.875
Come, we have to go.

48:35.083 --> 48:35.916
Now.

48:47.541 --> 48:50.748
Take
me with you, please, take me.

48:50.750 --> 48:52.831
Please, Mary,
take me with you.

48:52.833 --> 48:54.998
Take me with you.

49:13.208 --> 49:14.208
There is someone in my room.

49:15.166 --> 49:16.541
Someone? Did you see him?

49:17.708 --> 49:20.000
No. They...

49:24.333 --> 49:28.248
- No one, nothing.
- It's one of your nightmares, Claire.

49:28.250 --> 49:31.623
- I will sit with her.
- No, no, I will take her to bed.

49:31.625 --> 49:35.458
You need to rest. Think of the baby.
Claire, come on.

50:12.250 --> 50:14.833
She sleeps. Finally.

50:16.875 --> 50:18.125
And you should, too.

50:24.125 --> 50:25.208
I love you, Mary.

50:32.750 --> 50:33.706
Allow me to do it.

50:35.208 --> 50:36.750
Absolutely no clue.

50:38.166 --> 50:40.123
I can't tell if you're
telling the truth or not.

50:40.125 --> 50:41.539
I am telling the truth.

50:41.541 --> 50:42.539
Who's paying for it?
I'm paying for it?

50:42.541 --> 50:43.998
No.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.248
You're gonna ruin me, Claire
Clairmont. You're gonna ruin me.

50:46.250 --> 50:50.164
- What's all this for?
- Oh, there you are. Guess what.

50:50.166 --> 50:52.750
Tonight we are having
a dinner party.

50:56.583 --> 50:59.664
Come here. Don't we deserve
a little fun?

50:59.666 --> 51:05.206
My dear, dear friend Thomas Hogg is in town
and has just published his first book.

51:05.208 --> 51:08.581
So I thought we would throw
him a party to celebrate.

51:08.583 --> 51:10.831
Ma'am, how many guests are we
expecting this evening?

51:10.833 --> 51:12.831
Maybe 10.

51:12.833 --> 51:15.956
10 or 12?

51:15.958 --> 51:17.248
12.

51:17.250 --> 51:19.500
Did the publisher's advance
come in?

51:23.166 --> 51:25.414
I borrowed against
my father's estate.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.289
Percy, there's no way we can
afford to pay it back.

51:28.291 --> 51:31.750
Come on... come here. Come.

51:46.958 --> 51:49.958
I'm sorry it's not much of
a celebration, Mr Hogg.

51:52.333 --> 51:54.831
It appears we're even more
scandalous than we realized.

51:54.833 --> 51:56.206
Don't trouble yourself, Mary.

51:56.208 --> 51:59.539
Shelley and I have a long
history of courting trouble.

51:59.541 --> 52:02.081
We began writing a novel
together back at Oxford but

52:02.083 --> 52:03.581
publishers deemed it
too subversive.

52:03.583 --> 52:07.289
We had more success with our
treatise which we wrote anonymously:

52:07.291 --> 52:09.539
'The Necessity of Atheism'.

52:09.541 --> 52:12.748
- Because it was published?
- Because it resulted in our expulsion from Oxford.

52:14.666 --> 52:17.623
I'm beginning to suspect you have
a penchant for being anonymous.

52:17.625 --> 52:21.706
What's the point of being published if you
don't have your name on it? Why bother?

52:21.708 --> 52:23.708
I assume you also write?

52:25.333 --> 52:27.248
It's not anything
like my parents.

52:27.250 --> 52:30.916
Soon Mary will produce a work
that will surpass all of us.

52:32.666 --> 52:33.956
How about you,
Miss Clairmont?

52:33.958 --> 52:37.081
Do you write or are there
other tricks you perform?

52:37.083 --> 52:39.498
I have my own talents.

52:39.500 --> 52:42.998
- Claire is an accomplished singer.
- So she says.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.539
I'm yet to hear it.

52:45.541 --> 52:46.916
Will you sing for us?

52:48.333 --> 52:53.623
I will sing, and if you
happen to overhear

52:53.625 --> 52:55.789
I suppose,
it can't be helped.

52:55.791 --> 52:59.250
She has spirit this one,
I can see why you keep her.

53:01.291 --> 53:06.123
âª A sweet scented courtier did
give me a kiss âª

53:06.125 --> 53:10.289
âª And promised me rightly that
I would be his âª

53:10.291 --> 53:13.581
âª But I'll not believe him for
it is too true âª

53:13.583 --> 53:17.414
âª Courtiers promise much more
than they do âª

53:17.416 --> 53:22.748
âª My thing is my own
That I'll keep it so still âª

53:22.750 --> 53:26.666
âª Other young lassies can do
what they will âª

53:32.250 --> 53:35.623
Ma'am, Mr. Hogg...
is here to see you.

53:35.625 --> 53:36.500
Mr. Hogg?

53:37.458 --> 53:38.416
Thank you, Eliza.

53:41.291 --> 53:45.331
Shelley will be sorry to have missed you.
Would you care to wait?

53:45.333 --> 53:46.208
I should like that very much,
Mary.

53:47.333 --> 53:49.208
- Are you hungry?
- I'm fine, thank you.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.039
You're writing?

53:52.041 --> 53:56.706
Ledgers. But it might
as well be Latin.

53:56.708 --> 54:01.248
- Are you schooled in Latin?
- Yes, my father insisted upon it.

54:01.250 --> 54:03.081
Why don't you sit down?

54:03.083 --> 54:05.333
I fear my Latin is not what
it was when I was at Oxford.

54:07.791 --> 54:10.166
May I...
practice upon you Mary?

54:11.500 --> 54:13.458
I'm not sure I'd
be of much use to you.

54:15.041 --> 54:17.331
My mind is all over the place
these days.

54:20.166 --> 54:23.458
Perhaps you should practice
upon me.

54:29.541 --> 54:32.706
I cannot believe you fired
the servant for that, Shelley.

54:32.708 --> 54:34.248
Who do you think you are?

54:42.625 --> 54:43.708
Mary?

54:45.833 --> 54:47.666
What's wrong?
Is it the baby?

54:48.625 --> 54:51.291
Claire, could you
please leave us?

55:00.958 --> 55:02.291
Hogg came to the house.

55:04.458 --> 55:05.458
And then

55:08.458 --> 55:13.289
- ...he made an advance, but I didn't, I-
- So you did not comply?

55:13.291 --> 55:17.539
Of course not.
I would never-

55:17.541 --> 55:20.248
Mary. Hey.

55:20.250 --> 55:24.208
I have no quarrel with you
and Thomas becoming lovers.

55:25.916 --> 55:27.375
Isn't this what
we believe in?

55:28.458 --> 55:30.250
Unconventional approaches
to living?

55:31.666 --> 55:34.956
After all, why should we not have such
an arrangement? I do not own you.

55:34.958 --> 55:37.041
You are free to be with
whomever you please.

55:38.625 --> 55:40.666
Oh, but I don't want to be
with anyone else.

55:42.583 --> 55:45.956
Don't you believe that love
is free?

55:45.958 --> 55:52.498
- Yes. Free to be with one person...
- That is poor logic, Mary.

55:52.500 --> 55:54.373
Your choice means
nothing to me.

55:54.375 --> 55:57.500
What disappoints me is that
you wouldn't even consider it.

56:00.458 --> 56:02.414
Leads me to question how much
you value your beliefs

56:02.416 --> 56:07.123
when you will not
attempt to live them.

56:07.125 --> 56:13.623
I believe, with all my heart, there
are all sorts of ways of living.

56:13.625 --> 56:16.833
And I will fight for anyone's
right to live accordingly.

56:18.666 --> 56:22.458
But my truth is that there
is no one else for me.

56:30.291 --> 56:32.375
Do you wish to be with
someone else?

56:34.041 --> 56:38.333
I merely suggest that you do not offer
me the same freedoms I offer you.

56:41.541 --> 56:44.666
You're a hypocrite.
Like your father.

56:47.375 --> 56:52.458
And you are nothing close to the
man that I thought you were.

57:04.625 --> 57:09.581
Wanting for my 'happily
ever after', I lowered my defenses

57:09.583 --> 57:11.208
forgetting the first lesson
I was taught:

57:12.250 --> 57:14.581
that I was brought into this
world to be abandoned.

57:14.583 --> 57:16.500
That I am irrevocably alone.

57:36.041 --> 57:36.958
Mary.

57:45.583 --> 57:46.916
Are you not cold, Mary?

57:49.291 --> 57:51.208
My hypocrisy keeps me warm.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.083
As does my cloak
of disappointment.

57:55.791 --> 57:58.789
I'm going to tell Hogg not to
call here again.

57:58.791 --> 58:00.666
I already told him
with my fist.

58:02.958 --> 58:04.666
You have to understand,
Mary, that...

58:07.500 --> 58:11.500
...I have always
lived this way... to a fault.

58:14.875 --> 58:19.375
And I thought this was
something we both believed in.

58:22.958 --> 58:24.625
An ideal we shared.

58:26.750 --> 58:31.206
But had I truly considered it, and I let
myself fully understand what I was doing

58:31.208 --> 58:37.416
I would never let anything...
anything come between us.

58:43.250 --> 58:44.541
I have a surprise for you.

58:47.416 --> 58:48.458
We're going out.

58:54.833 --> 58:55.916
Well, what are
you waiting for?

59:03.916 --> 59:06.748
Phantasmagoria. Starring

59:06.750 --> 59:08.625
Claire Clairmont,
yours truly.

59:11.375 --> 59:12.625
It's Lord Byron.

59:14.875 --> 59:16.041
Let us go and talk to him.

59:18.833 --> 59:20.041
Lord Byron!

59:23.500 --> 59:24.373
My Lord...

59:24.375 --> 59:27.331
may I introduce to you
the poet

59:27.333 --> 59:31.623
Percy Bysshe Shelley and a
great admirer of your work.

59:31.625 --> 59:33.083
I know Mr. Shelley.

59:33.708 --> 59:35.414
I enjoyed "Queen Mab".

59:35.416 --> 59:38.500
- Credit to you.
- Thank you.

59:46.250 --> 59:50.125
And now our final act,
Mr. Brycison the Galvanizer.

59:51.833 --> 59:56.789
Who amongst you has ever wondered
if the dead could return to life?

59:56.791 --> 01:00:03.333
Thanks to scientific discovery, mankind
is on the cusp of conquering mortality.

01:00:07.583 --> 01:00:10.750
Using this frog
and an electrical current

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.458
I will demonstrate how muscular stimulation
is possible via electrical means.

01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:28.708
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce
you to the process of galvanism.

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:36.831
Is that really possible? That the
dead could come back to life?

01:01:36.833 --> 01:01:38.375
There is every possibility.

01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:41.375
That has brought you
back to life.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:53.956
Oh, Clara, you are
so beautiful... and tiny.

01:01:53.958 --> 01:01:56.166
Did you ever see
such tiny hands?

01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:59.123
She's so beautiful.

01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:01.708
Almost as beautiful as you,
my love.

01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:04.875
Mary, can I get you anything?

01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:07.250
I have all I need.

01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:11.583
And what a trio we will be.

01:02:13.875 --> 01:02:15.166
Yes, she agrees.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.875
You agree?
We're gonna be a trio.

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:23.123
You're gonna be our special
little prodigy. Yeah.

01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:53.956
I can scarcely believe
that one small being can be responsible

01:02:53.958 --> 01:02:54.958
for such joy.

01:02:56.791 --> 01:02:59.956
Is all that is truly required
is that we live well, be happy,

01:02:59.958 --> 01:03:01.791
and make others so?

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:07.041
âª Over the hills and far... âª

01:03:10.625 --> 01:03:12.500
She's sleeping.

01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:36.458
We must leave at once.

01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:38.166
What do you mean?

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:41.000
What has happened?

01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:43.416
Creditors are coming.

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:48.039
- Percy. Clara's not well.
- Mary, we do not have time to discuss this.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:49.789
It's raining outside.

01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:52.998
We can't take her. The doctor
said she must keep warm.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.456
We have no choice.

01:03:54.458 --> 01:03:55.623
Claire, are you ready?

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:57.539
Percy.

01:03:57.541 --> 01:04:00.039
Eliza,
do not tell them anything.

01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:01.539
Claire.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.750
Mary. Come.

01:04:07.958 --> 01:04:08.916
Please.

01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:17.000
We must get back
to St. Pancras.

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.375
They won't find us there.

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:23.958
Mary!

01:04:26.041 --> 01:04:27.125
Mary, please.

01:04:46.958 --> 01:04:48.625
She needs shelter now.

01:05:11.958 --> 01:05:12.750
Mary...

01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:17.458
it breaks my heart to see you
like this.

01:05:18.583 --> 01:05:23.750
The doctor told you, Clara
was never for this world.

01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:27.458
What about your books?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.583
I mean surely there is something
you would like to read?

01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:34.625
The books?

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:39.125
The books survived the
creditors, didn't they?

01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:43.456
I miss her, too, Mary.

01:05:43.458 --> 01:05:44.958
Desperately.

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:49.833
Desperately. But I don't
want to lose you as well.

01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:58.791
Leave me alone.

01:06:40.833 --> 01:06:43.664
Rose
leaves, when the rose is dead

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:47.500
Are heaped
for the beloved's bed

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:52.831
And so thy thoughts
When thou art gone

01:06:52.833 --> 01:06:57.875
Love itself shall slumber on

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:08.498
âª Tommy
was a piper's son âª

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:14.081
âª He learned to play
when he was young âª

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:21.289
âª The only tune
that he could play âª

01:08:27.247 --> 01:08:30.455
You'll come
to me in dreams, my love.

01:08:30.457 --> 01:08:32.457
I will not ask a
dearer bliss.

01:08:39.122 --> 01:08:41.166
I dreamed of her last night.

01:08:42.041 --> 01:08:48.163
That we lit a fire in the fireplace and the
fire's warmth nursed her back to life.

01:08:50.916 --> 01:08:54.332
My love, I haven't
seen you smile at me in weeks.

01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:57.082
Oh, Claire.

01:09:17.707 --> 01:09:22.621
- He invited you to Geneva?
- No, Mary. Lord Byron has invited us.

01:09:22.622 --> 01:09:26.166
- Us?
- You, me and Shelley. All of us.

01:09:27.457 --> 01:09:30.415
Do you think you are the only
one who can attract a poet?

01:09:32.291 --> 01:09:37.457
No, Claire. In fact I am
very aware of your abilities.

01:09:41.247 --> 01:09:43.957
But... we have to go.

01:09:45.707 --> 01:09:46.872
I am pregnant.

01:09:51.497 --> 01:09:52.747
Who's the father?

01:09:55.582 --> 01:09:59.250
Mary. Mary, it is Byron's,
of course.

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:05.498
I've been meeting him in secret
for quite some time now.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.455
Don't you see?

01:10:07.457 --> 01:10:11.164
Geneva will give me the chance to talk
to him, away from the crowds of London.

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:14.455
I mean you, of all people, should
know that this city loves a scandal.

01:10:16.291 --> 01:10:19.625
Shelley, we've been invited
to Geneva by Lord Byron.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:24.080
Lord Byron? Oh my word!

01:10:24.082 --> 01:10:26.414
This is
an unmissable opportunity.

01:10:26.416 --> 01:10:30.373
This could help us immensely.
Um...

01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:32.416
I'm not ready for this.

01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:37.205
Mary.

01:10:37.207 --> 01:10:41.415
Percy, I don't think I'm
ready for this. Please.

01:10:42.916 --> 01:10:45.416
- Not yet.
- Oh, Mary, I miss her too.

01:10:46.707 --> 01:10:49.750
Oh,
I wish I could have saved her.

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:55.333
I'm not asking you to let go
of her, Mary.

01:10:56.332 --> 01:10:58.832
I'm just asking you to raise
above your grief.

01:11:00.082 --> 01:11:03.750
To raise her spirit to the
great heights she deserves.

01:11:52.457 --> 01:11:53.540
Thank you.

01:11:57.207 --> 01:11:59.705
I was surprised to hear you
were staying here?

01:11:59.707 --> 01:12:01.539
Most tourists come to gawk at
the place.

01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:04.914
We've become accustomed to prying eyes
ourselves. I'm sure we'll manage.

01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:06.208
Mr. Shelley!

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:25.666
It is a pleasure to make
your acquaintance once more.

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:32.998
I received Miss Clairmont's letter yesterday
alerting me of this impending arrival.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.457
My Lord, it is an honor. And may I
introduce Miss Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin?

01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:43.583
Miss Godwin.

01:12:45.375 --> 01:12:50.248
Forgive me but there is a smile
hidden inside of you, I can see it.

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:55.039
And it is
beautiful and brutal.

01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:58.748
And I hope that before long I
can coax it outside of you.

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:01.457
And there she is.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.080
My Lord.

01:13:05.082 --> 01:13:07.082
Claire.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.705
Claire, I must remember next time
that to mention travel plans to you

01:13:17.707 --> 01:13:18.914
is tantamount
to an invitation.

01:13:18.916 --> 01:13:23.998
My Lord, I apologize. I fear
there's been some confusion.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.998
If our visit is an imposition,
we will seek lodging elsewhere.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.498
Please, don't concern yourselves.
You must stay here as my guest.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:30.623
Things have been getting
bloody boring round here and I

01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:32.330
will be grateful
for the distraction.

01:13:32.332 --> 01:13:36.789
In fact there is the Duke of
Dulldom himself, Doctor Polidori.

01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:37.625
Come with me.

01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:46.623
Doctor Polidori, Miss Godwin.

01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:47.541
She doesn't smile.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.875
Charmed, Miss Godwin.

01:13:59.832 --> 01:14:01.125
Don't embarrass the servants.

01:14:02.082 --> 01:14:05.539
Are you a Doctor of Science,
Doctor Polidori?

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:09.414
- I'm sorry, but I'm a physician.
- Science fascinates Mary.

01:14:09.416 --> 01:14:11.498
Why is being a physician disappointing.
You save lives.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.205
You bring babies
into the world.

01:14:13.207 --> 01:14:15.039
You help poets with their
sleeping disorders.

01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:17.830
Doctor Polidori wrote
his thesis on the subject.

01:14:17.832 --> 01:14:20.750
And, conveniently, I've become quite
the somnambulist in his presence.

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:25.330
Well, I hope we can liven things
up for you a little, My Lord.

01:14:25.332 --> 01:14:27.415
I'm sure you will try,
Miss Clairmont.

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.705
Would you like to join me in
the parlor, Mr. Shelley?

01:14:31.707 --> 01:14:33.000
Of course.

01:14:37.875 --> 01:14:39.998
Perhaps you'll be more
comfortable conversing with

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.916
Claire and Doctor Polidori,
my love.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.375
Byron...

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:07.330
I must say,
the decor is interesting.

01:15:07.332 --> 01:15:10.748
Byron likes to record
his 'grand ideas'

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:12.955
on slips of paper and tack
them up on the wall.

01:15:12.957 --> 01:15:14.623
You should see the one
in the parlor.

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:19.291
Gets littered with paper when we have
company, or when he's stimulated.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.705
This is poetry, my brother.

01:15:37.707 --> 01:15:42.205
'On Death' by the
incomparable yours truly.

01:15:42.207 --> 01:15:44.250
Third stanza!
Summon the muse.

01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:53.205
The world is the nurse
of all we know

01:15:53.207 --> 01:15:56.830
This world the mother
of all we feel

01:15:56.832 --> 01:16:00.373
And the coming of death
is a fearful blow

01:16:00.375 --> 01:16:04.123
To the brain unencompassed
with nerves of steel

01:16:04.125 --> 01:16:05.539
When all we know

01:16:05.541 --> 01:16:07.955
or feel
or see

01:16:07.957 --> 01:16:11.500
Shall pass like an
unreal mystery!

01:16:13.791 --> 01:16:17.458
I found this article and
recalled your interest in science.

01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:27.958
Is this possible?
Reanimation?

01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:34.416
That is the claim. Applying the principle
of galvanism to human corpses.

01:16:36.041 --> 01:16:38.583
Every lady in the land
knows this.

01:16:39.707 --> 01:16:42.705
She walks in beauty
Like the night...

01:16:42.707 --> 01:16:45.873
of cloudless
Climes and starry skies

01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:48.873
And all that's bright
Of dark and light

01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:50.123
- What?!
- Bright! Bright, bright, bright!

01:16:50.125 --> 01:16:52.123
All that's best of
dark and bright

01:16:52.125 --> 01:16:53.164
Meet in the aspect
of her eyes

01:16:53.166 --> 01:16:54.580
That's mellow to

01:16:54.582 --> 01:16:57.455
thy tender light Which
heaven to gaudy day deny

01:16:57.457 --> 01:16:59.415
I was sorry
to hear about your baby.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:05.750
Her name was Clara.

01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:08.458
I don't mean to upset you.

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:12.916
No. No, you haven't at all.

01:17:15.457 --> 01:17:17.415
I thank you for speaking
of her.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.123
It's an unspeakable cruelty
for a woman to lose a child.

01:17:25.125 --> 01:17:27.875
I've seen it more times than
I care to remember.

01:17:30.666 --> 01:17:32.375
I'm in awe of you,
Miss Godwin

01:17:32.957 --> 01:17:37.789
and your strength
to survive it.

01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:38.708
Drink!

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:41.541
Drink. Drink.

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:51.875
Why not?
Why would I not be sure?

01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:11.830
It's called 'The Nightmare -
The Curse Of The Incubus'.

01:18:11.832 --> 01:18:16.875
The Angel fallen from grace
because of insatiable lust.

01:18:19.291 --> 01:18:20.833
You know the painter,
don't you?

01:18:22.832 --> 01:18:23.875
Henry Fuseli.

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:28.207
He was my mother's
first love.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.039
She tried to kill herself
with an overdose of laudanum

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.125
when he left her for
another woman.

01:18:37.166 --> 01:18:40.498
I've never reconciled how
someone as strong as my mother

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.957
was so vulnerable when it
came to love.

01:18:44.791 --> 01:18:51.414
Love will find its way through paths
where wolves would fear to prey.

01:18:51.416 --> 01:18:54.333
But if she wasn't impervious
to the pain of heartbreak

01:18:55.666 --> 01:18:57.916
what hope is there for the
rest of us?

01:19:00.582 --> 01:19:04.832
The great art of
life is sensation.

01:19:05.957 --> 01:19:09.373
To feel that you exist,
even in pain.

01:19:09.375 --> 01:19:10.666
I mean would you
not die for love?

01:19:11.957 --> 01:19:16.250
After all, what is life if it
does not have love?

01:19:17.916 --> 01:19:20.166
Nothing,
according to you poets.

01:19:22.832 --> 01:19:23.875
You are...

01:19:27.666 --> 01:19:28.914
I've always believed
that a woman

01:19:28.916 --> 01:19:33.205
should be intelligent enough to
understand what I'm saying but

01:19:33.207 --> 01:19:39.080
not intelligent enough to be able to
form ideas or opinions of her own.

01:19:39.082 --> 01:19:42.164
You, Miss Godwin, have the
chance to prove me wrong.

01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:47.832
Play us a tune, Shelley.

01:20:09.541 --> 01:20:13.833
Oh, this infernal copying.
I'm bored of it.

01:20:14.916 --> 01:20:18.583
I can't transcribe another
word of these poems.

01:20:25.332 --> 01:20:27.290
It's been raining like this
for weeks.

01:20:28.125 --> 01:20:30.123
We're all going to go insane.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.498
Can't anyone think of ways to
pass the time?

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.957
- Mary, please.
- No. She's right.

01:20:41.457 --> 01:20:42.414
Listen.

01:20:46.916 --> 01:20:49.958
There are witches
in the wind.

01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:53.000
I have an idea.

01:20:57.541 --> 01:21:03.041
We are, each one of us,
to write a story.

01:21:05.582 --> 01:21:06.540
A ghost story.

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.248
It's a competition,
of course.

01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:16.875
Whoever writes the
finest story shall win.

01:21:21.582 --> 01:21:25.790
Miss Clairmont... you...

01:21:26.957 --> 01:21:30.375
...your job is to
transcribe them.

01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:33.457
How dare you?

01:21:35.166 --> 01:21:39.500
What right do you have to treat
me like this? Your lover.

01:21:41.332 --> 01:21:42.665
Claire...

01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:47.125
...you are not my lover.

01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:50.625
You are a dalliance.

01:21:51.332 --> 01:21:53.165
A lapse in judgement.

01:21:54.707 --> 01:21:58.625
A silly little girl.

01:22:08.125 --> 01:22:10.041
I'm sorry,
have I caused a scene?

01:22:19.875 --> 01:22:23.125
Sir, I have an urgent message
arrived from London.

01:22:29.916 --> 01:22:31.291
Claire!

01:22:46.041 --> 01:22:47.500
Is everything alright, sir?

01:22:58.625 --> 01:22:59.500
Claire.

01:23:01.291 --> 01:23:03.541
Why,
why must they be so vile?

01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:13.708
Don't let such
cruelty wound you.

01:23:14.791 --> 01:23:18.205
You're stronger than you
realize and you don't need

01:23:18.207 --> 01:23:19.457
anything from them.

01:23:21.082 --> 01:23:23.080
You don't need anything
from them.

01:23:32.416 --> 01:23:33.875
Thank you, Mary.

01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:06.166
No!

01:24:07.332 --> 01:24:09.000
- I need to speak to you.
- No!

01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:30.748
I no longer see the
world and its works as they before

01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:32.166
appeared to me.

01:25:33.125 --> 01:25:34.125
But now misery has come home...

01:25:35.957 --> 01:25:41.332
and men appear to me as monsters
thirsting for each other's blood.

01:25:43.332 --> 01:25:46.330
And I, a miserable spectacle
of wrecked humanity...

01:25:46.332 --> 01:25:49.707
pitiable to others and
intolerable to myself.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.080
Has Claire risen?

01:25:55.082 --> 01:25:58.040
She sent down word. She is
feeling unwell this morning.

01:25:59.332 --> 01:26:00.582
Where is Shelley?

01:26:03.207 --> 01:26:04.498
I had assumed
he was with you.

01:26:08.457 --> 01:26:09.707
I think we've found him.

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:13.291
Mr. Shelley.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.455
You look like you could do
with some breakfast.

01:26:18.457 --> 01:26:19.207
Do I?

01:26:21.416 --> 01:26:22.914
How were the taverns?

01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:24.750
Disgusting.

01:26:26.832 --> 01:26:30.332
I, uh,
I started upon my story.

01:26:31.375 --> 01:26:33.080
I've called it 'The Vampyre'.

01:26:33.082 --> 01:26:36.330
Very well. Well we have our
first story.

01:26:36.332 --> 01:26:38.290
A vampire.

01:26:39.375 --> 01:26:43.164
I thought the challenge
was a-was a ghost story?

01:26:43.166 --> 01:26:45.291
Not a childish superstition.

01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:48.705
You do not believe in
vampires, Mr. Shelley?

01:26:48.707 --> 01:26:51.330
No more than I believe
in physicians.

01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:53.125
Percy, that's quite enough.

01:27:00.457 --> 01:27:01.873
I thought you would
know intimately

01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:05.750
about the existence of nocturnal
beings who exploit the vulnerable.

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:18.582
- Did you just slap him?
- Madam, you have my sympathy.

01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:25.875
No story from Polidori.
How disappointing.

01:27:26.957 --> 01:27:29.415
Whatever shall we do to
entertain ourselves now?

01:27:36.082 --> 01:27:37.707
Well I'm going to go riding.

01:27:42.291 --> 01:27:44.375
I need something thick
between my legs.

01:27:48.375 --> 01:27:49.875
What's wrong with you?

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:51.791
You think I'm an idiot.

01:27:52.916 --> 01:27:54.955
Oh, you claim no interest
in Hogg. That's alright.

01:27:54.957 --> 01:27:56.455
But the good doctor,

01:27:56.457 --> 01:28:00.539
oh yes, he's more to your
liking, isn't he?

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:01.750
Where were you all night?

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:05.125
I do not have to justify
myself to you or to anyone!

01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:10.414
- You have no idea the responsibilities I bear.
- What responsibilities?

01:28:10.416 --> 01:28:12.291
She drowned herself, Mary.

01:28:14.457 --> 01:28:18.539
Threw herself in the filthy
water at Battersea.

01:28:18.541 --> 01:28:19.416
Who?

01:28:21.582 --> 01:28:22.957
Harriet.

01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:26.000
My wife.

01:28:39.416 --> 01:28:41.250
It's time that we
left this place.

01:28:47.457 --> 01:28:48.623
Claire?

01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:50.291
He doesn't want me.

01:28:52.207 --> 01:28:53.623
He said...

01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:59.125
he said that he will provide
for the baby but that is all.

01:29:08.832 --> 01:29:12.457
It's been such a mistake.
Mary.

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:15.457
A mistake.

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:50.250
I wanted to say goodbye

01:29:52.625 --> 01:29:56.291
to thank you
for your hospitality.

01:30:00.166 --> 01:30:01.625
I know what you
must think of me

01:30:03.582 --> 01:30:06.625
but I have never considered
myself one for fatherhood.

01:30:08.416 --> 01:30:10.916
I am under no illusions about
your situation.

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:15.080
Claire, unfortunately...

01:30:15.082 --> 01:30:16.539
I never loved her.

01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:18.539
Nor did I pretend
to love her.

01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:22.248
Nor do I believe
she loved me.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:27.830
But a man is a man,
and a girl is a girl.

01:30:27.832 --> 01:30:32.455
And when a young girl comes prancing
to an old man at all hours...

01:30:32.457 --> 01:30:35.000
...there is but one way.

01:30:36.541 --> 01:30:39.041
There is always another way.

01:30:41.625 --> 01:30:46.625
And when we make such choices,
there are inevitably consequences.

01:31:09.125 --> 01:31:11.582
Always see.

01:31:18.625 --> 01:31:19.750
Safe travels, Mary.

01:31:21.625 --> 01:31:23.623
I look forward to reading
your work some day.

01:32:22.582 --> 01:32:26.040
Rid yourself of the
thoughts and words of other people, Mary.

01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:30.750
Find your own voice.

01:32:56.957 --> 01:33:00.832
It was a
dreary night of November and...

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:05.789
It was a dreary night
of November

01:33:05.791 --> 01:33:09.789
that I beheld the
accomplishment of my toils.

01:33:14.166 --> 01:33:16.708
Remember that
I am thy creature.

01:33:18.332 --> 01:33:24.205
I ought to be thy Adam but I
am rather the fallen angel

01:33:24.207 --> 01:33:27.582
whom thou drivest from joy
for no misdeed.

01:33:31.166 --> 01:33:33.333
Everywhere I see bliss...

01:33:36.832 --> 01:33:37.707
...from which...

01:33:40.666 --> 01:33:45.833
...from which, from which I
alone am irrevocably excluded.

01:33:47.916 --> 01:33:52.958
I was benevolent and good
Misery made me a fiend

01:33:53.916 --> 01:33:55.955
Make me happy.

01:33:55.957 --> 01:33:59.125
And I shall again
be virtuous.

01:34:00.375 --> 01:34:02.625
"But soon", he cried

01:34:04.166 --> 01:34:05.583
"I shall die

01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:09.375
and what I now feel be no
longer felt.

01:34:13.375 --> 01:34:14.750
Soon...

01:34:15.666 --> 01:34:19.875
these burning miseries will
be extinct.

01:34:29.957 --> 01:34:34.790
I shall ascend my funeral
pyre triumphantly

01:34:36.125 --> 01:34:40.166
and exult in the agony of the
torturing flames.

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:46.205
My spirit will sleep in peace
or if it thinks

01:34:46.207 --> 01:34:49.165
it will not surely
think thus.

01:34:51.582 --> 01:34:52.540
Farewell."

01:34:59.916 --> 01:35:02.166
The End.

01:36:06.916 --> 01:36:08.833
Mary. Mary.

01:36:13.291 --> 01:36:14.875
It is magnificent.

01:36:16.166 --> 01:36:19.914
It exceeds even what I
believed you capable of.

01:36:19.916 --> 01:36:21.375
It has so much potential.

01:36:22.625 --> 01:36:23.957
I just have one question.

01:36:25.207 --> 01:36:28.373
The doctor, he gets all
these body parts

01:36:28.375 --> 01:36:32.039
and he sews them together in order
to make the most perfect creature

01:36:32.041 --> 01:36:36.248
But when he brings it to life, essentially
what he has created is a kind of monster.

01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:37.082
Yes.

01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:42.039
Well couldn't it be something
more- something more hopeful?

01:36:42.041 --> 01:36:46.791
Imagine if he could create the
perfect being. Um, an angel.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.414
An angel?!

01:36:49.416 --> 01:36:52.998
Yes, and in doing so he could
show what Man can be.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.498
He creates a version of ourselves
that shines with goodness

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:59.541
and thus, thus delivers
a message for mankind.

01:37:00.832 --> 01:37:02.375
It is a message for mankind.

01:37:03.541 --> 01:37:06.998
Well I, I mean a message of
hope and of perfection.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.332
What would you- what would we
know of hope and perfection?

01:37:16.125 --> 01:37:17.082
Look around you.

01:37:19.041 --> 01:37:20.875
Look at the mess we've made.

01:37:22.416 --> 01:37:23.666
Look at me.

01:37:39.375 --> 01:37:40.875
It makes sense this way.

01:37:44.791 --> 01:37:48.958
- I'll take it to my publisher and convince...
- No. I will go alone.

01:38:01.791 --> 01:38:03.750
You are how old, Miss Godwin?

01:38:06.082 --> 01:38:07.165
I am 18.

01:38:08.041 --> 01:38:09.875
That really is quite young.

01:38:11.291 --> 01:38:15.998
If I'm old enough to bear children,
I'm old enough to put pen to paper.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.873
Curious subject matter for a
young lady, wouldn't you say?

01:38:19.875 --> 01:38:25.080
And when that young lady just
happens to be the wife, uh...

01:38:25.082 --> 01:38:28.957
companion of Mr. Shelley...

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:35.039
Are you suggesting the work
belongs to Mr. Shelley?

01:38:35.041 --> 01:38:40.539
Well, perhaps there are some other writings
of yours that I could compare it to?

01:38:40.541 --> 01:38:42.000
It is my story.

01:38:43.875 --> 01:38:46.955
Did you ask this of Mr. Shelley when
he first presented his work to you?

01:38:46.957 --> 01:38:50.205
Or do you save this insult
for young women?

01:38:50.207 --> 01:38:57.539
And you dare to question a woman's
ability to experience loss, death...

01:38:57.541 --> 01:38:59.039
...betrayal.

01:38:59.041 --> 01:39:03.916
All of which is present in this story.
In my story.

01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:09.289
Which you would have realized if you'd
employed the time judging the work

01:39:09.291 --> 01:39:10.833
instead of judging me.

01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:30.833
Did you finish it?

01:39:33.082 --> 01:39:34.165
Yes.

01:39:35.707 --> 01:39:37.415
It chilled me to the bone.

01:39:40.125 --> 01:39:42.375
It's good to enjoy a ghost
story now and then.

01:39:44.082 --> 01:39:46.165
We both know this is
no ghost story.

01:39:49.916 --> 01:39:57.250
I've never read such a perfect encapsulation
of what it feels to be abandoned.

01:40:00.082 --> 01:40:02.165
I seethed with your
monster's rage.

01:40:04.207 --> 01:40:05.665
I lusted for his revenge.

01:40:08.916 --> 01:40:10.416
Because it was my own.

01:40:19.707 --> 01:40:21.289
I wonder...

01:40:21.291 --> 01:40:27.330
...how many souls will sympathize
with your creature's torments?

01:40:27.332 --> 01:40:30.082
More than should, I expect.

01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:37.750
It is time I moved home.

01:40:39.916 --> 01:40:42.916
You must get your story
published, Mary.

01:40:50.166 --> 01:40:52.955
Dear Madam, thank
you for sending us your manuscript,

01:40:52.957 --> 01:40:55.039
'Frankenstein or
A Modern Prometheus'.

01:40:55.041 --> 01:40:58.248
Unfortunately, this is not a
piece that interests us.

01:40:58.250 --> 01:41:01.580
inform you that we shall not
be publishing your manuscript.

01:41:01.582 --> 01:41:03.164
our taste in
judgement alike revolts

01:41:03.166 --> 01:41:06.539
This subject is not to the taste of
our readers from a female author.

01:41:06.541 --> 01:41:10.789
In fact, it strikes us as hardly an
appropriate subject for a young lady

01:41:10.791 --> 01:41:16.248
We do not deny that the work has merit
but we are cautious in proceeding.

01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:20.125
The truth is you have nowhere
else to go with your story.

01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:46.248
The Lackington Group will publish it.
500 copies will be printed.

01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:51.289
It will be published anonymously,
provided you write the introduction.

01:41:51.291 --> 01:41:54.125
Well of course.
I'd be delighted.

01:41:57.666 --> 01:41:59.205
So everyone will think
you wrote it.

01:41:59.207 --> 01:42:01.457
Provided it's published,
what does it matter?

01:42:03.957 --> 01:42:05.250
What does it matter?

01:42:07.332 --> 01:42:10.290
How is it possible that you
still don't understand?!

01:42:11.416 --> 01:42:15.664
You want me to abandon my claim because
my gender might spoil its success.

01:42:15.666 --> 01:42:17.664
- I never said that.
- You don't have to.

01:42:17.666 --> 01:42:22.039
Not once do you ever think about
the consequences of your actions!

01:42:22.041 --> 01:42:24.830
You bear just as much
responsibility for our life as I.

01:42:24.832 --> 01:42:28.623
I, I'm not the, some grand
architect of our misery, Mary.

01:42:28.625 --> 01:42:31.373
You bear the responsibility.

01:42:31.375 --> 01:42:34.791
I bear the responsibility
of ever believing in you!

01:44:11.582 --> 01:44:13.455
...thank you.

01:44:13.457 --> 01:44:14.957
John!

01:44:23.082 --> 01:44:25.915
- You look...
- Like I've seen better days?

01:44:27.541 --> 01:44:28.750
Mr. Godwin said the same.

01:44:29.582 --> 01:44:30.790
You saw my father?

01:44:33.125 --> 01:44:36.375
Yes.
His shop is stocking my work.

01:44:37.416 --> 01:44:38.291
You finished it.

01:44:39.166 --> 01:44:40.083
Not quite.

01:44:42.625 --> 01:44:43.500
Lord Byron!

01:44:44.582 --> 01:44:45.789
I'd all but forgotten
about it until

01:44:45.791 --> 01:44:49.500
Byron's publisher somehow got a
hold of it and printed it as his.

01:44:51.250 --> 01:44:53.289
I tried to assert my rights
as the true author

01:44:53.291 --> 01:44:56.248
but in response I've only
been called a plagiarist.

01:44:56.250 --> 01:44:59.664
I will write to Byron and appeal
to him to tell the truth.

01:44:59.666 --> 01:45:03.998
He has already tried.
He despises the story.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.207
The public just has no
interest in the truth.

01:45:07.582 --> 01:45:09.500
What about your
mysterious masterpiece?

01:45:10.541 --> 01:45:11.833
The absence of your
name was notable.

01:45:12.791 --> 01:45:14.083
It is ironic, isn't it?

01:45:15.875 --> 01:45:19.289
I write a story lampooning Byron,
the blood-sucking devourer of souls

01:45:19.291 --> 01:45:21.414
and he gets all the credit.

01:45:21.416 --> 01:45:25.164
While you wrote about a desperately
lonely and abandoned creature.

01:45:25.166 --> 01:45:28.580
Abandoned by an irresponsible
narcissist and She-

01:45:28.582 --> 01:45:30.207
Shelley gets all the credit.

01:45:32.666 --> 01:45:35.208
Nonetheless, congratulations.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.207
Shelley must be pleased.

01:45:38.957 --> 01:45:40.790
I haven't seen
Shelley in months.

01:45:48.582 --> 01:45:49.707
It's for you.

01:45:54.625 --> 01:45:56.750
We have created monsters,
Mary.

01:45:58.541 --> 01:45:59.958
But let's not let them
devour us.

01:47:20.541 --> 01:47:22.500
Gentlemen, welcome. Thank
you for coming.

01:47:23.791 --> 01:47:30.664
We're here to celebrate the success of
'Frankenstein; Or The Modern Prometheus'.

01:47:30.666 --> 01:47:33.664
It's a remarkable story
asserting, as it does, the...

01:47:33.666 --> 01:47:36.998
absolute human necessity
for connection.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.998
From the moment Doctor Frankenstein's
creature opens its eyes

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.455
it seeks the touch of its creator.
But he recoils in terror

01:47:45.457 --> 01:47:50.414
leaving the creature to its first
of many experiences of neglect

01:47:50.416 --> 01:47:51.500
and isolation.

01:47:53.291 --> 01:47:56.666
And if only Frankenstein had been
able to bestow upon his creation

01:47:58.125 --> 01:48:01.500
a compassionate touch.
A kind word.

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.000
What a tragedy might have
been avoided.

01:48:05.375 --> 01:48:10.330
But it is a credit to the writer
that it is these very thoughts

01:48:10.332 --> 01:48:13.205
that continue to run through
our minds long after we've

01:48:13.207 --> 01:48:15.580
turned the final page
of this book

01:48:15.582 --> 01:48:20.625
which I know you all agree is
one of the most complete and

01:48:22.166 --> 01:48:25.541
certainly one of the most
original publications of our age.

01:48:28.166 --> 01:48:29.125
As...

01:48:37.416 --> 01:48:38.166
Thank you.

01:48:39.957 --> 01:48:40.790
Thank you.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.539
I know many of you wonder who could
have written this horrific tale

01:48:48.541 --> 01:48:51.414
and why was it
published anonymously.

01:48:51.416 --> 01:48:55.498
I see some of you suggest
that the work belongs to me.

01:48:55.500 --> 01:49:00.082
Indeed, you could say that the work would
not even exist without my contribution.

01:49:05.791 --> 01:49:07.000
But to my shame

01:49:09.457 --> 01:49:13.205
the only claim I remotely
have to this work

01:49:13.207 --> 01:49:18.915
is inspiring the desperate loneliness
that defines Frankenstein's creature.

01:49:22.416 --> 01:49:27.539
The author of 'Frankenstein; Or A
Modern Prometheus' is, of course

01:49:27.541 --> 01:49:29.830
Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin.

01:49:37.207 --> 01:49:42.790
It is a work of singular genius and she
is indebted to no one in its creation.

01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:57.707
Percy.

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:00.375
Mary.

01:50:06.832 --> 01:50:09.040
I really thought you'd left
for good.

01:50:16.166 --> 01:50:18.791
I never promised you a life
without misery

01:50:20.666 --> 01:50:24.248
but I underestimated the
depths of despair

01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:27.625
and the weight of regret we
were to endure.

01:50:30.041 --> 01:50:32.916
I lost everything to be with
you, Percy.

01:50:36.332 --> 01:50:39.332
Always set out to create
something wonderful

01:50:41.250 --> 01:50:42.707
something beautiful.

01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:47.957
But something volatile
seethed within us.

01:50:50.791 --> 01:50:51.833
Behold...

01:50:54.332 --> 01:50:57.665
the monster galvanized

01:51:00.291 --> 01:51:04.791
but if I had not learned to
fight through the anguish

01:51:06.125 --> 01:51:08.541
I would not have found this
voice again.

01:51:10.457 --> 01:51:12.790
My choices made me who I am.

01:51:15.957 --> 01:51:18.580
And I regret nothing.

01:53:03.582 --> 01:53:06.580
You were
soon borne away by the waves

01:53:06.582 --> 01:53:10.330
and lost in darkness
and distance.
