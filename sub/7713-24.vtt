19:23.746 --> 19:26.414
For real? You're not
kidding? l did?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.458
No, you're the best
person for the job.
You're going to be great.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.585
Oh, Michael, thank you !
Okay.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.255
Thank you. Thank you.
You will not be sorry.

19:33.339 --> 19:38.343

(LAUGHlNG)

19:39.595 --> 19:41.805

l didn't get it.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.973
Oh. Really?

19:43.057 --> 19:44.057
Yeah.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.559
That was really good.
'Cause you said l didn't.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.060
That was really good.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.478
What about Ryan?

19:48.563 --> 19:50.856

l offered him
his temp job back.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.065
We'll see.

19:52.149 --> 19:55.735
He was not happy at all
when l offered him this job,

19:55.820 --> 19:57.988
and then l told him
that he didn't
get the job, so. . .

19:58.072 --> 20:00.824
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't
fake-fire people anymore.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.451
l don't appreciate you
telling me what to do,

20:03.536 --> 20:06.079
so clean out your desk.
You are through.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.541
Thanks, Michael.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.251

20:12.461 --> 20:13.628

20:17.258 --> 20:19.384

20:20.469 --> 20:21.636
(EXCLAlMlNG)

20:23.890 --> 20:25.390
Hello.
Hi.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.600
Have a seat.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.520
This is very
difficult to say.

20:30.605 --> 20:33.356
But no one here likes
you in the office,

20:33.441 --> 20:35.775
and we're going to
have to let you go.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.282
Hank, would you come
up here, please? Hank
is our security guard.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.618

He will be
ushering you out.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.286

(LAUGHlNG)

20:57.632 --> 20:58.632

Okay.
