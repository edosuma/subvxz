WEBVTT

00:08.051 --> 00:10.575
- I told you to walk it back.

00:10.619 --> 00:13.578
Tell Trudy's friend it was me
who got in the altercation,

00:13.622 --> 00:15.493
not you...me.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.539
- Sarge, listen.
I thought about it.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.149
I thought about it long
and hard,

00:19.193 --> 00:21.064
and I just--I did what
I thought was best

00:21.108 --> 00:22.587
for you and for everyone else.

00:22.631 --> 00:25.416
- It's not your job
to protect me, to protect us.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.331
- Why is that?

00:27.375 --> 00:29.420
Why are you the only one that
gets to live by a code?

00:29.464 --> 00:32.119
I don't understand.
Boss, this is who I am.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.556
I'm always gonna do whatever
I can to protect you all.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.166
It's how I'm built,
like Al was,

00:36.210 --> 00:37.515
like you were,
and I just don't understand

00:37.559 --> 00:39.126
why you don't get that.

00:39.169 --> 00:42.129
- Because you're no Al,
and you're not me.

00:42.172 --> 00:45.567
You're a kid, got your whole
life in front of you.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.528
- Well, I can handle whatever
comes my way--

00:50.572 --> 00:52.530
- We had one chance to make
this right, you hear me?

00:52.574 --> 00:54.358
One and you blew it.

00:54.402 --> 00:58.667
- Sarge, listen to me--
- This is my unit, my unit.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.756
I take the heat,
I take the bullets.

01:00.799 --> 01:01.844
Is that clear?

01:03.541 --> 01:05.456
Is that clear?

01:05.500 --> 01:06.762
- It's clear.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.721
I'm sorry.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.429
- Is Antonio coming back,
Sergeant?

01:21.472 --> 01:22.734
- It's up to Antonio.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.693
- Bernie.
- Hey.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.521
- Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

01:26.564 --> 01:28.392
- I live around the corner.
I had to come and risk it.

01:28.436 --> 01:29.741
- Oh.

01:29.785 --> 01:30.829
- Some cops actually like me,
Hank.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.266
- Yeah, name one.
- You.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.442
- Don't confuse "respect" with
"like."

01:34.485 --> 01:37.227
Kim, this is Bernie Hoffman,
plays for the other team.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.707
- I'm aware of your work.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.752
I thought most defense
attorneys were against Kelton.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.580
- Hmm, I prefer mayors who
empower police,

01:42.624 --> 01:43.712
not pull their pants down.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.150
Oh, I gotta run.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.891
Nice to meet you, Kim.
- Nice to meet you.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.501
- Let's grab dinner sometime,
Hank.

01:50.545 --> 01:51.633
Ann would love to see you.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.200
- Tell her I said "hey."

01:54.636 --> 01:57.900
- Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention.

01:57.943 --> 02:00.120
Thank you.

02:00.163 --> 02:03.601
It is a true honor to introduce
this man

02:03.645 --> 02:06.735
that I have worked with
for 27 years.

02:06.778 --> 02:09.825
He has protected this city
where he was born and raised.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.609
He is a true Chicagoan.

02:11.653 --> 02:15.178
He is the man that needs to be
Chicago's mayor now.

02:15.222 --> 02:18.181
The Superintendent of Police,
Brian Kelton.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.575
- Thank you, Kate.

02:20.618 --> 02:21.576
Thank you.
Thank you all.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.273
Thank you all very much.

02:23.317 --> 02:26.276
Before I begin, I want to
acknowledge the rank and file.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.191
Let's--let's show 'em how
we feel.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.721
- Thank you, I...

02:36.765 --> 02:39.681
I may have just seen
Sergeant Hank Voight

02:39.724 --> 02:41.248
crack a smile.

02:41.291 --> 02:45.208
That's real police,
best of the best.

02:45.252 --> 02:50.387
Now, my opponents talk about
unifying Chicago.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.870
That's a noble word, unity.

02:54.913 --> 02:59.222
But unity to my opponents means
working with gangs,

02:59.266 --> 03:02.225
creating programs
to--to help gangs,

03:02.269 --> 03:04.227
and that's just not what
Chicago needs right now,

03:04.271 --> 03:07.622
nor is it anywhere on
my agenda.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.581
Coddling criminals will
do nothing

03:10.625 --> 03:14.542
to help the law abiding
citizens of Chicago.

03:14.585 --> 03:19.286
To be clear, I don't wanna work
with gangs...

03:21.418 --> 03:22.811
I'm gonna crush 'em.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.602
- Thank you. Thank you.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.737
- All right.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.869
I'll wait to hear from you.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.262
Thank you.

03:40.437 --> 03:41.395
- Anything from COPA?

03:41.438 --> 03:43.223
- Still investigating.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.225
Thanks, man.

03:45.268 --> 03:46.835
Appreciate it.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.793
Now what do you say we get out
of these monkey suits,

03:48.837 --> 03:51.361
grab a drink and talk about,
I don't know, anything else?

03:51.405 --> 03:53.668
- Think I'm gonna go home.
- Okay.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.540
- Units in 18 and units on
the citywide,

03:56.584 --> 03:59.369
reports of shots fired
coming from the inside

03:59.413 --> 04:02.329
a residence at
224 East Scott.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.895
- Oh, that's right around
the corner.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.507
- Hey, Sarge, shots fired
a few blocks out.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.558
- You first guy on the scene?
- Yes, sir.

04:14.602 --> 04:15.820
- All right, come in the back.
- All right.

04:15.864 --> 04:16.952
- Come on, let's go.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.705
- Body.

04:35.710 --> 04:38.452
- Where's cover?
- I got you.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.325
- Boss, it's Bernie Hoffman.

04:43.544 --> 04:44.632
- He's gone.

05:02.911 --> 05:05.348
- Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon now!

05:05.392 --> 05:07.089
- Hold--stand down, stand down.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.396
Ann, Ann, Ann.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.658
Relax, it's me, Hank Voight.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.399
- Put your gun down.

05:12.442 --> 05:15.010
It's okay, put the gun down,
it's Hank.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.490
- Hank?
- It's okay.

05:16.533 --> 05:19.536
I'm here to help.
Look, it's okay.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.582
It's okay.
-  Hank.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.627
- Oh, my God.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.368
They shot Bernie.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.935
- It's okay.
- Oh, my God.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.066
- It's okay, I got you.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.419
- I'm so sorry.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.557
- What do you got?

05:40.601 --> 05:42.951
- Well, wife's jewelry box
was rifled through,

05:42.994 --> 05:45.345
a few drawers were tossed.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.476
No sign of Hoffman's
cell phone,

05:46.520 --> 05:47.999
I looked high and low.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.523
- And the techs swabbed
Mrs. Hoffman for GSR,

05:49.566 --> 05:51.438
she's clean.

05:51.481 --> 05:52.700
They also did a quick test on
the thirty-aught-six,

05:52.743 --> 05:54.484
it has not been fired.

05:54.528 --> 05:55.920
- And the shell casings
are from a 9-millimeter.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.574
- You know, there's no sign
of forced entry,

05:57.618 --> 05:59.402
so either the offender
pulled off some kind of ruse,

05:59.446 --> 06:00.969
or Mr. Hoffman knew
the attacker,

06:01.012 --> 06:03.363
was having a meeting in here,
things went south.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.539
- Well, I'd say real south,
his jaw is broken.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.062
- Yeah.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.803
- Well, we know what kind of
people Bernie rep.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.500
Start with his clients.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.852
- I got a neighbor that saw
a gray Honda

06:14.896 --> 06:16.767
idling outside at the time
of the shooting.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.856
Two African American males
inside, didn't get a good look,

06:18.900 --> 06:20.380
but said they seemed
suspicious.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.381
- Well, they could have
just been

06:21.424 --> 06:22.730
looking for a parking spot.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.166
- Well, what about PODs
or shot cams?

06:24.209 --> 06:25.863
- Nothing so far.
- All right, keep digging.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.691
- Yeah.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.040
- Sir.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.564
- We got word it was
Bernie Hoffman.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.043
- Afraid so.
- What else you know?

06:32.087 --> 06:34.698
- It's all preliminary now,
nothing solid.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.788
Chance Hoffman knew
the offender, maybe a client.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.486
Either of you talk to him
tonight?

06:39.529 --> 06:41.096
- Yeah, I damn sure talked
to him.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.707
I thanked him for coming
to the fundraiser.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.666
- How'd he seem to you?
- Good.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.929
We talked Blackhawks and...

06:50.105 --> 06:52.542
And then that was it.
It's the last time I saw him.

06:52.586 --> 06:53.978
It's unbelievable.

06:54.022 --> 06:57.155
We had a roomful of officers
one block from here,

06:57.199 --> 06:58.722
including me.

06:58.766 --> 07:01.029
And some animal had the
audacity to...

07:03.597 --> 07:07.078
I want no stone left unturned,
Sergeant.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.080
Do you get me?

07:09.124 --> 07:11.909
- I get you.
- Good, keep me in the loop.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.998
- Sir.
Ma'am.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.963
- So, Bernie Hoffman had
multiple cases in pretrial,

07:22.006 --> 07:23.573
including seven homicides.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.445
All seven of those defendants
are in jail.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.142
- Yeah, he's also got
23 violent offenders

07:27.185 --> 07:29.231
awaiting their day in court,
and they're all out on bail.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.928
- All right, did you talk
to his firm?

07:30.972 --> 07:33.191
- Yeah, one client stood out,
Andre Griffin.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.106
He's a major player in
the Southside Hustlers.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.978
He calls for half of Englewood.

07:37.021 --> 07:39.720
Hoffman repped Griffin
on three major drug offenses,

07:39.763 --> 07:42.505
two agg assaults...Griffin
walked each time.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.464
- Griffin visited Hoffman's
work office.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.770
Apparently behind closed doors
things got pretty hot.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.511
Furniture was thrown,
it was a big fight.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.121
Hoffman told the partners that

07:50.165 --> 07:52.210
Griffin was just upset about
a bill, and he cooled off.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.734
- All right, you talk
to Griffin?

07:53.777 --> 07:54.822
- Yeah, he's on his way in
right now.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.476
- So, Englewood makes sense.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.955
Uh, we haven't gotten into
Hoffman's phone,

07:57.999 --> 07:59.653
but techs got into the cloud.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.568
And he got a text message
an hour before he was killed.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.265
It says, "It's a deal.
On my way."

08:03.308 --> 08:05.615
And the text originated from
a burner in Englewood.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.922
- Maybe Griffin's was the deal
that went south.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.188
- Where were you last night?

08:13.231 --> 08:14.624
- I was home last night.

08:14.668 --> 08:15.930
- Mm-hmm.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.801
Were you alone?

08:17.845 --> 08:20.717
- Wait, what's this about?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.069
- Your lawyer.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.682
- Damn.
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.553
- I don't know nothing
about that.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.729
Besides, why would I hurt him?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.252
I liked the guy.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.037
He saved my ass plenty of
times.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.821
- Yeah.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.520
When's the last time you talked
to Bernie?

08:40.563 --> 08:42.043
- Yo, this is crazy.

08:42.086 --> 08:45.089
One thing Bernie taught me,
you get brought in,

08:45.133 --> 08:46.917
you call a lawyer.

08:46.961 --> 08:50.138
- Well, we're just having
a conversation, Andre.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.662
- Law-yer.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.061
- I got something from
property crimes.

09:00.104 --> 09:02.585
- Mrs. Hoffman's stolen jewelry
just popped up at a pawn shop,

09:02.629 --> 09:03.804
black male dropped it off.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.066
The caught him on
security camera.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.633
- Where's the pawn shop?
- Englewood.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.069
- Check it out.

09:09.070 --> 09:11.681
Hey.
- You look familiar.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.596
Welcome back, man.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.555
- Thanks.
- Glad you're back.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.557
Let's go.
- Okay.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.039
- Hey.
- Late on my first day back.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.127
It's not a great look, right?

09:23.171 --> 09:24.912
- Don't worry about it.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.827
- I had to drop my daughter
off.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.045
She's seeing a therapist.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.352
- Good for her.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.136
It's a hell of a thing.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.225
How you feeling?

09:34.269 --> 09:35.270
- Ready.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.314
- Good.

09:36.358 --> 09:39.317
- Hey, um...

09:39.361 --> 09:41.624
I had a lot of time in there,
and I did some thinking.

09:41.668 --> 09:42.669
- Mm-hmm.

09:42.712 --> 09:43.800
- There's no way I can let Adam

09:43.844 --> 09:44.932
go through with this COPA
thing.

09:44.975 --> 09:45.976
- Antonio, we're way past that.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.761
- I know.

09:47.804 --> 09:51.242
- Look, you say anything now,
we all pay the price.

09:51.286 --> 09:54.332
Hang tight, let the process
play out, understood?

10:05.300 --> 10:06.910
- Hey, man.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.956
Adam Ruzek, Chicago PD.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.697
- Basir, pawn shop guy.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.133
- Is this the jewelry, Basir?

10:12.176 --> 10:14.614
- Yup, take it before I change
my mind.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.224
- Why, what's it worth?

10:16.267 --> 10:19.401
- 50 thou, give or take.
The kid had no clue.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.011
- How much did you pay?

10:21.055 --> 10:24.232
- 500, am I gonna get that
back?

10:24.275 --> 10:26.974
- Well, uh, not anytime soon,
sorry.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.671
- Yeah, it's a match for
Ann Hoffman's.

10:28.715 --> 10:29.977
- Fantastic.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.108
All right, I hear you got
this genius

10:31.152 --> 10:32.327
on security camera too, yeah?

10:32.370 --> 10:34.111
- Yep, right over here.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.728
- Uh, does that look like
Griffin to you?

10:41.771 --> 10:44.426
- No. Maybe his, like, nerdy
younger brother.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.781
Who the hell are you?

10:54.001 --> 10:55.959
Let's see if anything pops
on facial rec.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.880
- Busy night, DeVante.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.143
You got two priors,
and you're still at it.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.145
Persistent.
What'd you do, clear a grand?

11:08.189 --> 11:09.799
- I was just holding that
for someone.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.019
- Well, you hold away,
'cause we don't care.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.414
'Cause we got surveillance
of you in a pawn shop

11:16.458 --> 11:19.156
selling this man's stolen
jewelry...

11:21.028 --> 11:23.857
Ten hours after that.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.078
- I-I found those jewels
in a dumpster.

11:28.122 --> 11:31.778
- DeVante, stop lying.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.824
You're staring down life
for murder.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.173
Now you tell us what happened,

11:36.217 --> 11:38.480
you got a shot at seeing
daylight again.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.960
- You got the wrong black man.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.352
- Okay, who's the right one?

11:41.396 --> 11:43.180
- 'Cause we got witnesses that
say they saw you

11:43.224 --> 11:44.921
and another guy outside
that man's house

11:44.965 --> 11:46.053
right before that happened.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.358
- I never went inside.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.273
- Hmm.
- Hmm, so you were there?

11:49.317 --> 11:51.798
- No, I didn't say that.
Y'all trying to trip me up.

11:51.841 --> 11:56.150
- Okay, let's talk about
your cousin, Andre Griffin.

11:57.281 --> 11:58.456
- What about him?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.981
- Hoffman was Andre's lawyer.

12:01.024 --> 12:03.374
- Is that the dead dude's name?

12:03.418 --> 12:05.289
- Was Andre with you?

12:08.336 --> 12:10.381
Is he the other man
our witness saw?

12:12.949 --> 12:17.214
DeVante, you gotta come clean.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.914
- Sarge, I got something.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.046
It's important.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.534
- So, this is from a CTA
bus cam last night.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.144
The route goes right past
Hoffman's house.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.146
This was taken at 9:42.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.807
That's Brian Kelton.

12:44.851 --> 12:48.028
He said he last saw Bernie
at the fundraiser.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.944
So, he lied right to our faces.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.467
Why?

13:02.999 --> 13:05.872
- Under my administration
you're going to see

13:05.915 --> 13:07.874
more police on the street,

13:07.917 --> 13:10.702
more arrests of violent
gang members,

13:10.746 --> 13:12.922
more homicides solved,

13:12.966 --> 13:16.926
and your neighborhoods
are going to be safe again.

13:16.970 --> 13:20.408
And I understand I have
a long road ahead

13:20.451 --> 13:22.410
before I can gain your trust.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.847
We can do better.

13:24.891 --> 13:29.765
But under my leadership,
police reform is working.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.508
And to keep Chicago pointed
in the right direction...

13:35.640 --> 13:37.338
I need your help at
the ballot box.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.601
- You wanna help us?
Stop murdering our children.

13:39.644 --> 13:40.863
all: Yeah.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.473
- Yeah.
- That's right.

13:42.517 --> 13:43.605
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.870
- Sergeant, how are you?

13:47.914 --> 13:49.437
- Good.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.569
You got a minute?
- 100%, walk with me.

13:51.613 --> 13:52.788
Got an update on the Hoffman
case?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.616
- Well, not exactly.

13:54.659 --> 13:57.010
We're having a little trouble
with our timeline, though.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.446
You know, from the cell phone

13:58.489 --> 14:00.709
we know Hoffman got home
around 8:35.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.885
- From the fundraiser, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.322
As far as we know
he was alone there

14:05.366 --> 14:07.455
till the offender showed up
around ten.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.028
- I was in there, Hank.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.507
- Okay.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.813
- I stopped by for
a few minutes.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.294
- Uh-huh.
- I was gone by 9:30.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.817
If I saw or knew anything
relevant,

14:21.861 --> 14:24.080
I'd have mentioned it to you.

14:24.124 --> 14:27.388
- That's a hell of an omission.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.955
Look, I'm not looking to bury
anyone,

14:28.998 --> 14:30.478
I'm just working the case.

14:34.525 --> 14:38.486
Well, we know that Hoffman
was shot with a 9-millimeter,

14:38.529 --> 14:41.924
so...I'll need to see
your service weapon.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.624
It'll be processed anonymously.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.800
I don't wanna see a good
policeman's name

14:48.844 --> 14:50.411
get raked through the mud.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.980
- I'll make sure somebody
gets it to you.

14:54.023 --> 14:58.985
Bernie...was working on
a personal matter for me.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.727
- It's none of my business.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.120
- Let's keep it that way.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.862
- We're ready to go, sir.
- Good.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.646
Sergeant.
- Superintendent.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.083
Thanks for the update.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.704
- How'd it go with Kelton?

15:22.747 --> 15:25.011
- Admits he was there,
let's see what his gun says.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.795
- Sarge, I talked to
Cook County jail.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.362
I got some potential DeVante
leverage.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.972
Patrol pinched his aunt
last night

15:30.016 --> 15:31.147
on some drug charges.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.583
She basically violated
her parole.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.411
- DeVante's close with her?

15:34.455 --> 15:35.717
- She's been taking care of him
since he was a shorty,

15:35.760 --> 15:37.414
seen a situation like this
before.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.634
She'll feel like he owes
her one.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.462
- Work it.
- Got it.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.511
- How much you love
your auntie, DeVante?

15:49.861 --> 15:50.993
- Hmm.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.821
Love ain't the right word.

15:53.735 --> 15:54.997
I'd be dead without her.

15:55.041 --> 15:58.566
- Well, she's looking
at six years.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.136
Six.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.920
You cooperate with us,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.835
she can be cooking dinner
tonight at the crib.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.145
So, we do know that you were
at Bernie Hoffman's house

16:12.188 --> 16:14.147
last night with another man.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.976
Was that man your cousin,
Andre Griffin?

16:17.019 --> 16:19.152
Hey, listen, I know.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.937
Nobody wants to snitch on
family.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.941
But you gotta step up.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.725
Okay?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.901
I think you know you do,
because who do you owe it to,

16:29.945 --> 16:31.686
the woman who raised you

16:31.729 --> 16:33.775
or the punk who put you
in that seat right there?

16:39.172 --> 16:40.956
Were you with Andre Griffin
last night?

16:47.832 --> 16:49.617
Okay, what did you see?

16:54.056 --> 16:56.232
- I was outside in the car
the whole time,

16:56.276 --> 16:59.061
but Griff told me what
went down.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.629
He went there to pick up
something from that white guy.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.805
- Okay, what was he picking up,
money, drugs?

17:03.848 --> 17:05.850
- I don't know.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.939
All I know is Griff caught
the guy

17:07.983 --> 17:09.898
recording them with his phone.

17:09.941 --> 17:13.858
And the dude said he couldn't
trust no one, got crazy.

17:15.686 --> 17:19.690
Griff shot him and tried to
make it look like a burglary.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.524
- That's good, DeVante.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.918
Yeah, it's real good.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.704
But we need more than
your word.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.625
What do I gotta do?

17:56.292 --> 17:59.600
Yo, something's wrong.
Griffin's never late.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.037
- If DeVante gets
too squirrelly, Kevin,

18:02.081 --> 18:03.604
you pull him right out of
there.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.085
- Copy that.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.134
- What's wrong?

18:13.570 --> 18:16.182
Haven't taken a long-eye
in years.

18:16.225 --> 18:19.315
- I get it, but Voight wants
you to go slow.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.230
It makes sense.

18:23.972 --> 18:26.192
- Is that the second time
that blue sedan hit the block?

18:26.235 --> 18:27.802
- I'm not sure.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.892
Listen...

18:32.285 --> 18:35.201
Anytime you wanna talk about,
you know,

18:35.244 --> 18:39.118
what went down...I'm here
for you.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.861
- Thanks, Kim.

18:43.905 --> 18:46.342
- Yeah, yeah.

18:52.783 --> 18:55.830
- Yo, this ain't working, man.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.878
- Sarge, this kid's losing it,
man.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.967
- It's your call, Kev.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.795
- I'ma pull him.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.206
- Yo, Griff's a busy man.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.729
I told you he wouldn't
have time.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.296
- DeVante, just go home, okay?

19:27.340 --> 19:29.255
If he contacts you,
you contact me immediately.

19:29.298 --> 19:30.778
You understand that?

19:30.821 --> 19:31.953
- Is my aunt still gonna be
okay?

19:31.996 --> 19:33.215
- DeVante, just go home, okay?

19:38.873 --> 19:40.657
- Kevin, you hit?

19:40.701 --> 19:42.398
- I'm good, I'm good.
You got him?

19:42.442 --> 19:43.921
- Go, I got the kid.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.097
- Oh, God, it hurts, it hurts.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.012
- Did you see who did it?

19:48.056 --> 19:50.189
Who did it, man?
- No. No!

19:52.408 --> 19:54.367
- Police! Stop!

20:01.417 --> 20:04.855
- Kevin!
10-1, 10-1, officer down.

20:04.899 --> 20:08.294
Repeat, officer down,
5650 South Loomis.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.339
- It's okay, it's okay.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.906
You stay with me, Kevin.

20:11.949 --> 20:13.690
- Stay with me.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.170
You stay with me.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.867
- Come on.
Come on!

20:23.657 --> 20:24.962
- Hey, thanks.
- Yeah.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.356
- Any word?
- Nothing.

20:30.403 --> 20:33.232
- I knew something wasn't right
about that car.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.668
I should have called it out
to Voight.

20:34.711 --> 20:35.799
I don't know how the hell
I missed it.

20:35.843 --> 20:36.800
- Hey, I missed it too,
Antonio.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.280
You gotta let it go.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.369
- No, this is on me.
I had one job to do.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.763
- Hey, hey.
You look at me, look at me.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.286
All right, this is not on you.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.505
I need you to keep it together,
okay?

20:45.548 --> 20:47.594
Okay?

20:47.637 --> 20:49.683
- Okay.

20:49.726 --> 20:53.339
- Doctor, thank you.
Thanks a lot.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.515
Okay, I got good news.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.604
Kevin is gonna be fine.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.214
It was a tricky surgery.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.868
They took a bullet out of
his shoulder,

21:00.911 --> 21:04.306
but it wasn't life threatening.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.873
The best thing we can do
for Kevin is

21:05.916 --> 21:08.528
get back out there and drag
this prick in.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.356
So, I wanna know where
we're at.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.358
- The, uh, PODs are a negative
for the blue sedan,

21:12.401 --> 21:15.317
but a witness thinks they saw
an African American driving.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.232
- Shell casings recovered
from the drive-by

21:17.276 --> 21:18.538
are a match to the gun
that killed Hoffman,

21:18.581 --> 21:19.887
9-millimeter.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.454
- Well, that's enough to snatch
his ass up.

21:21.497 --> 21:22.629
- Oh, Sarge, we've been
looking.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.326
Griffin's in the wind.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.023
- All right, so let's find him,
hunt him down.

21:26.067 --> 21:29.462
Squeeze his crew till it hurts.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.420
Whatever it takes.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.312
- Headache, headache.

21:56.619 --> 21:57.925
Chicago PD, let me see
your hands.

21:57.968 --> 21:59.622
Hands in the air now.
- Get up.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.841
- On your feet!
- Get up against the wall.

22:00.884 --> 22:03.496
- Turn around.
- Police! Freeze.

22:10.546 --> 22:11.939
Hey! Stop! Police!

22:29.348 --> 22:30.436
- Antonio!

22:31.567 --> 22:33.482
Don't move, I'll light you up.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.703
Get those hands where
I can see 'em.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.444
Get out, get out.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.359
- Slow down, man.
- Shut up.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.490
- I'm doing what you say.
- Shut up.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.888
Here you go.
Who am I looking at, Kim?

22:47.931 --> 22:49.846
- Reggie Watt.
Reggie's on parole for distro.

22:51.848 --> 22:53.720
- Is that why you ran, Reggie?
Huh?

22:53.763 --> 22:55.461
You holding product?

22:55.504 --> 22:57.071
You give me Andre Griffin,
I never saw this bag.

22:57.114 --> 23:00.814
- Last I heard he's held up
in the stash house,

23:00.857 --> 23:03.425
5858 South Racine.
- Okay.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.688
- Put your hands behind
your back.

23:07.690 --> 23:10.824
Hey, that was a hell of a jump.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.391
You all right, Superman?

23:12.434 --> 23:14.001
- Definitely gonna feel it
tomorrow.

23:15.655 --> 23:16.830
- Listen, you got that baggie
of pills?

23:16.873 --> 23:17.831
I'll do the paper.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.006
- I can handle it.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.747
- You sure that's a good idea?

23:20.790 --> 23:22.139
- Yeah, I can handle it.

23:22.183 --> 23:24.707
Wait, hold--hold on.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.405
What, you don't trust me?

23:28.058 --> 23:30.844
- Right now with what happened,
no.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.498
Do I love you, Antonio?

23:32.541 --> 23:33.542
Do I want you to beat this
thing for good?

23:33.586 --> 23:35.544
Yeah, this is how I do it.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.515
Thanks.
Let's go get this guy.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.650
- Chicago PD!

23:57.044 --> 23:58.698
Clear.

23:58.741 --> 23:59.873
- Crossing.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.148
Guys, you gotta get in here.

24:15.497 --> 24:16.716
I found Griffin's bankroll.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.152
That's not the headline,
though.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.505
What's a gangbanger like
Griffin doing with

24:23.549 --> 24:24.811
"Kelton for Mayor" signs?

24:37.519 --> 24:39.478
- All right, thanks.

24:39.521 --> 24:40.957
Hey, guys, techs ran
the envelope

24:41.001 --> 24:42.002
we found at Griffin's
stash house.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.090
Hey, Sarge.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.874
It had 40 grand cash inside,

24:44.918 --> 24:46.136
and there was prints on
the outside of the envelope

24:46.180 --> 24:47.137
and on the cash.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.487
We got a hit.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.837
Kelton.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.362
- I was hoping he was better
than this.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.409
- Yeah, well, he's not.

24:58.453 --> 25:00.499
That son of a bitch been
lying to our faces

25:00.542 --> 25:03.110
from the second Bernie Hoffman
got shot.

25:03.153 --> 25:04.372
- So, the 40 G's is a payout

25:04.415 --> 25:06.069
from Kelton to Griffin
for votes.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.462
- Yeah, it makes sense.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.159
I find a legal pad at
Griffin's place

25:09.203 --> 25:11.205
with names and neighborhoods,
places to disrupt,

25:11.248 --> 25:12.815
pastors to bribe.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.991
All in the service of helping
Kelton win.

25:15.035 --> 25:18.125
- Chicago politics never
disappoints.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.388
- Okay, what happened
that night?

25:20.431 --> 25:23.565
- All right, so, the hotel is

25:23.609 --> 25:25.611
about a block away from
Hoffman's house.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.569
Kelton leaves the hotel
around 9:30,

25:27.613 --> 25:31.007
gets to Hoffman's...9:35,
he delivers the cash.

25:31.051 --> 25:34.445
The sometime after 10:00,
Griffin gets there,

25:34.489 --> 25:36.012
collects the money.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.406
- Hoffman's the bagman.
- Yeah.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.103
And Hoffman records
the meeting,

25:40.147 --> 25:41.235
'cause he wants to protect
himself.

25:41.278 --> 25:42.932
He doesn't trust Kelton.

25:42.976 --> 25:44.978
Griffin realizes the meeting's
being recorded,

25:45.021 --> 25:47.328
things go south,
goodbye Bernie.

25:49.112 --> 25:51.245
- All right, we know the who
and the why.

25:51.288 --> 25:52.594
Now we gotta prove it.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.161
- Sarge, the way things
are headed...

25:54.204 --> 25:56.206
- We follow the evidence
wherever it leads.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.342
This turns back on Kelton,
he ordered it,

26:01.385 --> 26:03.649
even if he just covered it up,
so be it.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.520
We arrest his ass.

26:07.087 --> 26:09.568
Anyone got a problem with that?

26:14.181 --> 26:16.183
All right, good.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.576
Let's get back out there.

26:25.453 --> 26:26.585
Kevin.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.544
Ho--you're out of bed
already.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.198
- Yeah, well, come on in .

26:31.241 --> 26:33.940
- Wow, I was hoping for
a little more drama.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.115
A hand hold or something.

26:35.158 --> 26:36.464
- Oh, I'm sorry, Trudy.

26:36.507 --> 26:37.639
You know, you can't keep
a good brother down.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.249
- Uh-huh.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.692
I was--I was really worried.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.653
So, don't do that again.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.002
Okay?

26:54.264 --> 26:55.701
- I'm not planning on it.

26:57.485 --> 26:59.618
- What you got there?

26:59.661 --> 27:01.968
- Trying to remember the tags.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.143
- Mm-hmm.

27:03.186 --> 27:06.668
- I had it,
I lost it.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.628
Kept repeating it over
and over.

27:09.671 --> 27:12.282
Crazy, 'cause...

27:12.326 --> 27:14.458
It might be my last breath
on God's green earth,

27:14.502 --> 27:18.245
and all I can do is try to
remember a license plate.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.943
This job, boy...

27:20.987 --> 27:22.597
- Did you see the driver?

27:23.685 --> 27:24.643
- No.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.560
But I saw the plates,
it's, uh, Indiana customs.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.606
- Uh-huh.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.654
- D-G...I don't know,
something.

27:37.177 --> 27:38.352
L-16 maybe?

27:38.395 --> 27:39.832
- But hey, it's a start.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.185
- How's DeVante?

27:48.536 --> 27:50.625
- Kevin, he died on the table.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.240
- We any closer to Griffin?

27:57.284 --> 27:59.503
- No, but, you know, maybe

27:59.547 --> 28:01.680
your partial will help
get us there.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.437
D-G-L-1-6.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.702
We're in business.
- What's up?

28:23.745 --> 28:25.355
- Atwater was one letter off.

28:25.399 --> 28:27.662
I got a blue Taurus sedan
reported stolen,

28:27.706 --> 28:29.185
Gary, Indiana, two weeks ago.

28:29.229 --> 28:30.360
- You got a VIN?
- Yeah, give me one sec.

28:30.404 --> 28:31.666
- I'll call the techs.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.712
- Superintendent,
how can I help you?

28:33.755 --> 28:35.626
- I'm just checking in
with the Sergeant.

28:35.670 --> 28:36.627
Don't let me get in your way.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.064
- Superintendent.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.109
- Sergeant, I apologize I
didn't

28:40.153 --> 28:41.241
make it over to the hospital,

28:41.284 --> 28:42.372
but I understand
Officer Atwater

28:42.416 --> 28:43.765
is feeling better.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.332
- Yes, he is.
- Progress on the shooter?

28:47.421 --> 28:50.076
- Chasing leads.
Can you excuse me a minute?

28:50.119 --> 28:51.642
- Yeah, 100%.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.122
- This is Voight.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.440
What's up?

29:06.483 --> 29:08.181
- Techs got into the navigation
system.

29:08.224 --> 29:10.096
The shooter's car is parked in
a small apartment complex,

29:10.139 --> 29:12.228
address 232 South Watson.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.621
- Anyone we know live there?

29:13.664 --> 29:15.754
- Tenants name is
Deisha Wallace, two priors,

29:15.797 --> 29:17.059
a mom to a one-year-old girl.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.105
Father's Andre Griffin.

29:21.281 --> 29:22.804
- All right, hopefully
Griffin's with her.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.633
Get over there with Adam,
confirm the car, move in.

29:25.676 --> 29:26.765
- Yeah.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.423
- What can I do for you, Brian?

29:33.467 --> 29:35.599
- Just checking up on
the Bernie Hoffman case.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.645
I, uh...

29:37.688 --> 29:39.603
I wanna make sure you have
all the resources you need

29:39.647 --> 29:41.083
to nail the prick
who did this.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.868
- Appreciate the offer,
we're good.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.698
- That mean you have a lead?

29:47.742 --> 29:49.526
- Means we're working the case.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.441
- I asked you
a direct question,

29:51.485 --> 29:53.574
and I damn sure expect
a direct response.

29:53.617 --> 29:55.141
- Direct?

29:56.316 --> 29:59.623
I'm sorry, it's just
a funny word choice.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.234
- Why's that?

30:01.277 --> 30:03.279
- Well, 'cause nothing about
this case

30:03.323 --> 30:05.847
or your involvement in it
has been direct.

30:11.244 --> 30:14.464
- Do you have a lead suspect,
Sergeant?

30:14.508 --> 30:16.815
- Like I told you, sir,
we're working the case.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.559
- You're playing a dangerous
game here.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.347
- So are you.

30:42.449 --> 30:44.320
- Why do I get the feeling
I'm investigating

30:44.364 --> 30:45.669
the end of my career?

30:45.713 --> 30:47.236
- Yeah, well, we stick to
the truth,

30:47.280 --> 30:48.455
we should be all right.

30:48.498 --> 30:49.891
- Like the truth matters
these days.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.893
Why does Kelton need Griffin's
vote anyway?

30:51.937 --> 30:53.416
He's just some drug-slinging
punk.

30:53.460 --> 30:54.678
- But he's a punk that can
help deliver

30:54.722 --> 30:56.376
half the South Side vote.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.508
- Yeah, I know, but, still.

30:58.552 --> 31:00.336
- Politicians and gangs
have been in bed together

31:00.380 --> 31:02.643
in this city since Al Capone.
It's Chicago.

31:02.686 --> 31:04.471
- There it is.
- Yeah.

31:04.514 --> 31:05.864
- New tags, huh?

31:05.907 --> 31:07.343
- Bullet holes.

31:07.387 --> 31:09.302
- All right, we're 100%
on the car.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.303
We're gonna sit right back
here.

31:10.346 --> 31:11.347
Jay, do your thing.

31:11.391 --> 31:12.871
- Yeah, copy that.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.890
- Hi there, ma'am.
I'm Jay, building maintenance.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.805
- You don't look familiar.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.372
- I've worked for the building
for, like, two years.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.852
Come on.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.332
- What you want?

31:39.375 --> 31:40.376
- Uh, we got reports
of a gas leak,

31:40.420 --> 31:41.943
uh, from this floor.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.597
So, we're just going around,
we're checking the units.

31:43.640 --> 31:44.728
It's only gonna take, like,
five minutes.

31:44.772 --> 31:45.947
And it's freezing outside,

31:45.991 --> 31:47.731
so we don't wanna evacuate
you guys.

31:47.775 --> 31:48.907
You know, we're just--we're
looking out for you.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.560
- Which other units?

31:50.604 --> 31:51.953
- Uh, it was 212, Ms. Diaz.

31:53.955 --> 31:56.392
- All right.
Hurry up.

31:56.436 --> 31:57.785
- It's a cute kid.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.613
- Come on, baby, it's okay.

32:01.267 --> 32:03.922
Aw. Baby hungry.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.781
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sunrise.

32:39.348 --> 32:40.959
- You son of a bitch.
You ain't no maintenance man.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.962
- Drop it. Your child is here,
I don't wanna hurt you.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.572
- Drop it.
- Jay, you good?

32:45.615 --> 32:46.790
- I'll be better when she puts
this knife down.

32:46.834 --> 32:47.966
- We're not gonna ask you
again.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.750
One...two...

33:03.894 --> 33:06.027
- Look, I swear I ain't seen
Griff in days.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.637
I don't know where he is.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.683
- Stop lying, Deisha
it's not helping.

33:09.726 --> 33:13.034
We got the car you stole
at the scene of this homicide.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.428
We recovered a bullet
from the officer who pursued.

33:15.471 --> 33:16.472
You're facing murder.

33:16.516 --> 33:17.996
- I didn't kill no one.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.736
I don't know anything about
this.

33:19.780 --> 33:22.043
- Deisha, we checked your car
for gunshot residue,

33:22.087 --> 33:23.784
it's all over the interior.

33:23.827 --> 33:26.439
- Y'all insane.
Is this what you do to folks?

33:26.482 --> 33:28.049
You say stuff till people
start believing it?

33:28.093 --> 33:29.659
- You understand that if
you don't cooperate,

33:29.703 --> 33:32.053
you are never gonna see your
kid again?

33:32.097 --> 33:33.968
You get that, right?

33:34.012 --> 33:38.016
- Look at me, Deisha.
Andre is going down.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.453
That's a fact.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.411
You wanna join him,
that's up to you.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.851
- Now who was driving
your car yesterday?

33:49.897 --> 33:51.029
Come on.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.903
- Andre.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.557
He dropped me off at work.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.124
- But where'd Andre say
he was going?

33:59.167 --> 34:00.951
- He didn't say.

34:00.995 --> 34:02.475
- Come on, Deisha, we need more
than that, let's go.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.042
- What am I supposed to say?

34:04.085 --> 34:07.001
We had coffee,
I walked him outside,

34:07.045 --> 34:08.959
I kissed him goodbye,

34:09.003 --> 34:11.049
he got in the car.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.877
Last thing I remember
was some big, fancy black SUV

34:13.921 --> 34:16.358
pulled up next to him,
and he started talking to

34:16.402 --> 34:17.925
some lady who got out of
the backseat.

34:17.968 --> 34:19.883
- All right, what this lady
look like?

34:19.927 --> 34:22.886
- White lady, blonde hair.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.888
- How old?

34:24.932 --> 34:26.716
- Looked like my mom's age.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.501
She had glasses,

34:28.544 --> 34:30.807
looked like some kind of
college professor or something.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.074
- Is that her?

34:36.117 --> 34:38.554
- Yeah.
That's the one.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.964
- Sarge, we got the Deputy
Superintendent of Police

34:57.007 --> 34:58.313
tipping off our target.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.098
I don't know how to proceed.
- Bury it.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.142
- What?

35:01.186 --> 35:02.883
- Keep it out of your paper.

35:02.926 --> 35:05.277
It's too hot.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.367
Listen, I'm gonna take
the lead on this, only me.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.195
I'll deal with Brennan.

35:10.238 --> 35:11.544
- Sarge.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.328
The Glock we recovered
at Deisha's,

35:13.372 --> 35:14.634
it's a match for all of
our vics,

35:14.677 --> 35:16.288
Hoffman, DeVante, Kev.

35:16.331 --> 35:18.333
- I've also got a CI who puts
Griffin hiding

35:18.377 --> 35:19.639
at a flophouse on Monroe.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.119
We got this prick.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.337
- All right, start typing
a warrant.

35:22.381 --> 35:23.425
I'll get a judge.

35:23.469 --> 35:26.602
We move in hot, fully loaded.

35:26.646 --> 35:29.127
I don't care if he comes out
in a bag.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.134
- You ready?
- Yeah.

35:42.357 --> 35:44.968
- Here we go.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.622
Got eyes on Griffin.

35:48.233 --> 35:49.669
- All right, standby,
he's pulling up.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.692
- He's on the phone.

36:12.735 --> 36:14.737
- Wait till he gets out,
Antonio.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.139
- Take him.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.363
- Chicago PD.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.544
- Put your hands against
the car.

36:38.587 --> 36:40.110
Put your hands on the car now.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.330
You got me?

36:42.374 --> 36:43.331
- Yeah.

36:54.516 --> 36:56.214
- Why are you smiling, Andre?

36:57.215 --> 36:59.260
- You think you've won.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.349
It's amusing.

37:01.393 --> 37:04.570
- They can't protect you
anymore.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.398
- You don't know nothing, fool.

37:09.096 --> 37:11.229
- Let me ask you something.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.187
That funny too?

37:14.754 --> 37:16.669
Where were you when they shot
your cousin?

37:16.712 --> 37:18.714
Answer that.

37:18.758 --> 37:21.587
- I'm done talking.
My lawyer's on the way.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.420
- I hope he's a good one.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.478
- Hank.

37:46.568 --> 37:48.527
- What can I do for you, Kate?

37:52.139 --> 37:55.098
-  I need you to release
Andre Griffin.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.710
- Excuse me?

37:57.753 --> 37:59.102
- I talked to State's
attorney's office.

37:59.146 --> 38:00.321
The evidence is weak.

38:00.365 --> 38:01.366
There's no fingerprints on
the gun,

38:01.409 --> 38:02.802
there were no witnesses.

38:02.845 --> 38:06.806
The defense is gonna tear
this case to pieces.

38:06.849 --> 38:11.724
- Case is strong, so...

38:11.767 --> 38:13.552
If there's nothing else...

38:13.595 --> 38:14.857
- We have an agreement, Hank.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.298
We made it after I helped
Olinsky.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.083
- Don't bring Al into this.

38:23.126 --> 38:24.345
- I told you...

38:25.868 --> 38:28.567
I told you there would be
a time when I ask you to

38:28.610 --> 38:32.788
solve cases in a hurry
or not...in a hurry.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.442
This is one of those.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.536
- I know it was you who
tipped off Griffin.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.582
- Excuse me?

38:43.625 --> 38:46.541
- His girlfriend saw you
talking to him

38:46.585 --> 38:48.891
a couple hours before
he killed his cousin.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.418
And tried to kill my man,
Atwater.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.680
- I am three generations
police,

38:54.723 --> 38:56.508
don't question my loyalty.

38:56.551 --> 38:59.162
- You're not loyal to the job.
You're loyal to Kelton.

38:59.206 --> 39:02.862
- I am. He's a good man,
and he's a good cop.

39:02.905 --> 39:05.299
He is responsible for
my career,

39:05.343 --> 39:08.302
I am not going to let him down.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.435
- How long has he been in bed
with the gangs?

39:10.478 --> 39:12.306
With Griffin?

39:12.350 --> 39:15.527
- He had absolutely no idea
that Griffin was involved.

39:15.570 --> 39:19.444
- Until Bernie got shot.
- Nobody wants this, Hank.

39:19.487 --> 39:20.706
Nobody.

39:20.749 --> 39:23.273
- When Atwater was in
surgery...

39:23.317 --> 39:26.668
I mean, you stood right next
to me, looked me in the eye.

39:26.712 --> 39:30.237
You told me you'd do whatever
you can to help.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.848
The whole time you knew it was
Griffin who did the shooting?

39:32.892 --> 39:35.590
- All I did was tell him
that he was up for the murder,

39:35.634 --> 39:37.418
that the police were
looking at him, that's it.

39:37.462 --> 39:40.203
I didn't know that he was gonna
shoot Atwater.

39:40.247 --> 39:42.380
- You crossed a line.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.773
- You wanna lecture me about
crossing a line, Hank?

39:44.817 --> 39:46.427
This is our line of business.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.386
Sometimes we do things
we're not proud of.

39:48.429 --> 39:49.909
You know that better than
anyone.

39:54.217 --> 39:55.523
- What does that mean?

39:59.005 --> 40:00.702
- You look the other way.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.271
You release Andre Griffin.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.582
- Get the hell out of
my office.

40:23.986 --> 40:25.640
- Thank you.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.992
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.

40:30.036 --> 40:32.386
- Hey, I heard about Griffin.
I thought you might be here.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.909
- Get out of my way.
- Calm down, let it go.

40:33.953 --> 40:35.607
You gotta let it go, all right?

40:35.650 --> 40:37.478
- It might as well have been
them that shot Kevin.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.262
- Kevin's gonna be all right.
- That's not the point.

40:39.306 --> 40:41.482
- I know, you think I like
this?

40:41.526 --> 40:43.876
Calling them out in public
makes you look bad.

40:43.919 --> 40:46.444
These two are more dangerous
than ten Griffins.

40:46.487 --> 40:49.403
So, we gotta be smart,
and we gotta be patient.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.752
We're playing
the long game here.

40:53.407 --> 40:55.278
This is Chicago.
