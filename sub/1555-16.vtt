00:01.984 --> 00:04.587
(Finch)
We are being watched.

00:04.589 --> 00:06.589
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.591 --> 00:11.427
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.429 --> 00:13.963
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.965 --> 00:15.598
but it sees everything...

00:15.600 --> 00:19.001
violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:19.003 --> 00:22.171
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:22.173 --> 00:24.206
We don't.

00:24.208 --> 00:28.878
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.746
You will never find us.

00:30.748 --> 00:32.548
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.549 --> 00:35.685
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

(Reese)
<i>Harper Rose.</i>

00:51.035 --> 00:53.035
She a grad student, Finch?

00:53.037 --> 00:55.170
(Finch) <i>Miss Rose is an anthropology
major from upstate New York,</i>

00:55.172 --> 00:56.605
<i>Mr. Reese.</i>

00:56.607 --> 00:59.375
Studied abroad in Europe.
Took time off to travel.

00:59.377 --> 01:00.743
(Reese)
<i>Typical college student.</i>

01:00.745 --> 01:02.378
(Finch)
<i>Atypical only in that</i>

01:02.380 --> 01:04.780
the machine did not
generate her social.

01:04.782 --> 01:07.683
It gave us her
college ID number instead.

01:07.685 --> 01:10.419
That's a little odd.
Any other issues?

01:10.421 --> 01:11.921
(Finch)
<i>Just with her roommate.</i>

01:11.923 --> 01:14.189
<i>Harper put in a written request</i>

01:14.191 --> 01:16.292
for transfer to campus housing.

01:16.294 --> 01:18.294
<i>She moved into a new single</i>
<i>this semester.</i>

01:18.296 --> 01:19.795
I'll look into
the ex-roommate.

01:19.797 --> 01:21.497
<i>You back on campus,</i>
<i>Mr. Reese?</i>

01:21.499 --> 01:22.932
I gotta say, it's
quite invigorating

01:22.934 --> 01:26.368
being around all these
idealistic young minds.

01:26.370 --> 01:28.804
You must be enjoying
your day job, professor.

01:28.806 --> 01:30.539
As near as I can tell,
college has become

01:30.541 --> 01:32.808
an overpriced Bacchanalia

01:32.810 --> 01:36.512
<i>full of entitled, oversexed</i>
<i>binge drinkers.</i>

01:36.514 --> 01:38.881
Well, somebody's gotta
pay your salary.

01:41.017 --> 01:44.286
(Reese) <i>Wait. Did she
just switch backpacks?</i>

01:44.288 --> 01:46.373
Hang on a second.

01:48.926 --> 01:51.392
[dog chewing off screen]

01:52.597 --> 01:54.597
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:54.599 --> 01:57.529
That's not a bone,
that's a Bontoni.

Protect your right to privacy.

02:10.648 --> 02:12.014
Excuse me,
you wanna help us out

02:12.016 --> 02:13.716
and stop big data?

02:32.602 --> 02:35.304
(Reese) <i>Picking up a dozen
cell phones, Finch.</i>

02:35.306 --> 02:37.706
All registered to
different users.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.608
(Finch)
<i>You are in a college dormitory.</i>

02:39.610 --> 02:43.579
Come on, Finch, within
a 15 foot radius?

02:43.581 --> 02:46.248
(female student)
Ahem. Creep.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.282
Oh.

02:47.284 --> 02:49.601
This is a woman's floor.

02:51.322 --> 02:53.977
Right, I was just leaving.

02:54.325 --> 02:56.225
<i>I think she's headed to</i>
<i>another floor.</i>

02:56.227 --> 02:57.533
[fast knocks on door]

03:01.599 --> 03:02.665
Hey, boo.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.133
Hey, babe.

03:04.135 --> 03:05.801
Thank you for
covering my shift.

03:05.803 --> 03:08.570
I feel like I'm
coming down with something.

03:08.572 --> 03:10.839
Yeah, it's called <i>Far Cry 4</i>

03:10.841 --> 03:12.508
- and the munchies.
- Hey.

03:12.510 --> 03:14.376
I need a break, okay?

03:14.378 --> 03:16.812
The boss man's got me
doing cash bank runs every day.

03:16.814 --> 03:19.248
The dude is bugging out
with all that cheddar.

03:19.250 --> 03:22.217
Look, I can handle
Noah. Okay?

03:22.219 --> 03:24.346
All right.

03:25.222 --> 03:27.940
- I'll hit you up later?
- I'll be here.

03:27.955 --> 03:30.125
(Finch) <i>Harper's gentleman

(Reese)
<i>Any violent crimes?</i>

(Finch) <i>Possession of marijuana,

03:39.070 --> 03:41.303
possession of

03:41.305 --> 03:44.016
No accounting for taste.

03:44.742 --> 03:46.175
[door shuts]

03:54.584 --> 03:56.485
(Reese)
<i>I got Harper in sight.</i>

03:56.487 --> 03:59.722
This job is way off campus.

03:59.724 --> 04:04.526
Finch? That shift
she's covering for Trey,

04:04.528 --> 04:06.962
he works in a dispensary.

04:06.964 --> 04:09.732
Medical marijuana?

04:09.734 --> 04:12.000
Do what you love, you'll
never work a day in your life.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.737
<i>State regulations require</i>
<i>a dispensary card</i>

04:14.739 --> 04:16.105
<i>for every patient.</i>

04:16.107 --> 04:18.540
How fast can you get
me into the database?

04:18.541 --> 04:22.344
<i>Let's see. Detective Riley</i>
<i>suffers PTSD</i>

04:22.346 --> 04:24.413
<i>from multiple gun shot wounds.</i>

04:24.415 --> 04:26.682
And let's say chronic back pain.
Back pain is better.

04:26.684 --> 04:29.284
I'll have Dr. Tillman call
it in. It won't take long.

04:29.286 --> 04:30.786
<i>Well, that was easy.</i>

04:30.788 --> 04:32.654
Finch, how do you know so
much about getting marijuana?

04:32.656 --> 04:36.625
Mr. Reese, do you want me
to call this in or not?

04:36.627 --> 04:39.450
(Root)
<i>On the job, Harold?</i>

04:41.966 --> 04:43.999
Ms. Groves.

04:44.001 --> 04:47.369
Good to see you're
still on task.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.454
The world could scarcely afford
to lose another pot dealer.

04:53.577 --> 04:56.411
Sri Lanka?

04:56.413 --> 04:58.413
I know you prefer
sencha green, but

04:58.415 --> 05:01.116
their black tea is to die for.

05:01.118 --> 05:03.051
I did as you asked.
I stayed away.

05:03.053 --> 05:06.421
You did that for
your own reasons, Harry.

05:06.423 --> 05:10.392
What if you're going
about it all wrong?

05:10.694 --> 05:13.361
Maybe we should be
looking for people to enlist.

05:13.363 --> 05:17.666
A good samaritan?
How can you say that after...

05:17.668 --> 05:21.203
everything that happened?

05:21.205 --> 05:23.338
"Everything that
happened." Is--

05:23.340 --> 05:24.906
Is that her name now?

05:24.908 --> 05:26.508
You said you didn't
want to talk about Ms. Shaw.

05:26.510 --> 05:29.377
Let's talk about
the 7.1 billion people

05:29.379 --> 05:30.979
out there, Harold.

05:30.981 --> 05:33.715
And the odds that
a few of them just might

05:33.717 --> 05:37.686
give us an advantage over a
runaway artificial intelligence.

05:37.688 --> 05:39.821
What's the Machine proposing?

05:39.823 --> 05:42.524
She wants me to build an app.

05:42.526 --> 05:44.126
For what purpose?

05:44.128 --> 05:45.627
Don't know yet.

05:45.629 --> 05:47.662
It's gotta be a killer app

05:47.664 --> 05:49.998
to get the attention
of the right people.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.767
Anyone in particular you
have in mind, Ms. Groves?

05:56.072 --> 05:58.640
Looks like you've got
your hands full, Harold.

05:58.642 --> 06:01.176
I can handle it.

06:01.178 --> 06:04.279
And this is for you.

06:04.281 --> 06:07.449
To die for.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.231
Detective John Riley.

06:23.233 --> 06:26.301
PTSD.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.570
Been shot multiple times.

06:32.741 --> 06:36.044
Sweet Mary Jane.
This place is legal?

06:36.046 --> 06:38.513
(Finch) <i>According to the state,
just not the federal government,</i>

06:38.515 --> 06:41.282
which means that it's
still a cash business.

06:41.284 --> 06:44.552
Wow. They must be
raking it in.

06:44.554 --> 06:46.387
(Finch) <i>They just can't find
any banks that will take it.</i>

06:46.389 --> 06:48.790
The banks can still be
prosecuted by the feds

06:48.792 --> 06:50.391
for taking illegal drug money.

06:50.393 --> 06:52.660
And they risk having
their charters pulled.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.329
So where does all the money go?

06:54.331 --> 06:56.164
<i>Good question.</i>

06:56.166 --> 06:58.600
<i>It's like the Wild West</i>
<i>or prohibition all over again.</i>

06:58.602 --> 07:00.535
It just makes
these dispensaries

07:00.537 --> 07:02.504
big, fat targets for criminals.

07:02.506 --> 07:05.473
(Finch) <i>And our number is
right in the thick of it.</i>

07:05.475 --> 07:08.810
(Harper)
<i>Thanks.</i>

07:08.812 --> 07:12.847
Skulk and dagger,
what are you having?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.582
Something for my back.

07:14.584 --> 07:16.951
Right.
You're new here.

07:16.953 --> 07:20.054
Uh, try the Kona push pops
over there.

07:20.056 --> 07:21.923
Thank you.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.529
What happened to Trey?

07:27.531 --> 07:29.130
He was supposed to make
a deposit this afternoon.

07:29.132 --> 07:30.965
You can't keep sending
burnouts to the bank

07:30.967 --> 07:33.301
with cash that smell
like skunk weed, Noah.

07:33.303 --> 07:35.203
(Harper)
<i>They're not stupid.</i>

07:35.205 --> 07:36.871
(Noah) <i>Thought that burnout
was your boyfriend.</i>

07:36.873 --> 07:38.306
I suppose you
have a better idea?

07:38.308 --> 07:39.741
The biggest commercial
banks in the world

07:39.743 --> 07:41.976
have been cleaning
cartel money for years.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.945
You just gotta pay
the right guy.

07:43.947 --> 07:46.014
That's money laundering.
We're not criminals.

07:46.016 --> 07:48.116
(Noah)
<i>This is a legal business.</i>

07:48.118 --> 07:50.084
Cash has to go somewhere, boss.

07:50.086 --> 07:51.753
What do we do with
tonight's haul?

07:51.755 --> 07:52.887
You're gonna have to make
a transfer to

07:52.889 --> 07:54.756
a secure off-site
holding facility.

07:54.758 --> 07:57.725
Security details sending
multiple cars.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.193
- Right now?
- Let them in the back.

07:59.195 --> 08:01.781
Then close up the shop.
Clock out.

08:09.672 --> 08:11.606
(Reese) <i>Sounds like our
anthropology major has been</i>

08:11.608 --> 08:14.008
<i>studying economics.</i>

08:23.252 --> 08:25.987
They're closing up shop, Finch.

08:25.989 --> 08:27.995
<i>It's a cash pick up.</i>

08:29.793 --> 08:32.794
They vary the times,
vehicle routes.

08:32.796 --> 08:34.729
That does not sound good.

08:34.731 --> 08:37.599
(Reese) <i>Even worse, these
guys aren't standard transpo.</i>

08:37.601 --> 08:39.067
<i>They're Brotherhood.</i>

08:39.068 --> 08:40.335
<i>Looks like Dominic is</i>
<i>getting into</i>

08:40.337 --> 08:42.732
<i>the legalized security</i>
<i>business.</i>

08:53.382 --> 08:54.926
Get out the car!

08:57.287 --> 09:00.588
(man) <i>This is the cartel.
It's an ambush!</i>

09:00.590 --> 09:01.789
[yelling in Spanish]
<i>Give us the money!</i>

09:01.791 --> 09:06.861
[gunfire]

09:12.968 --> 09:16.671
Oh, my God!
What just happened?

09:16.673 --> 09:19.307
Who the hell are you?

09:19.309 --> 09:21.509
Your lucky day.

09:21.511 --> 09:23.745
They were tipped off.
They knew your pickup time.

09:23.747 --> 09:25.906
What the hell?

09:29.352 --> 09:30.752
Damn.

09:30.754 --> 09:31.919
Bags were switched out.

09:31.921 --> 09:34.422
Where's the cash?

09:34.424 --> 09:36.737
I'll be right back.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.627
(Reese) <i>Finch, Harper knew
more about this cash pickup</i>

09:39.629 --> 09:41.596
<i>than she let on.</i>

09:41.598 --> 09:43.531
<i>What the hell you doing?</i>
<i>You lost your mind?</i>

09:43.533 --> 09:44.899
Do I know you?

09:44.901 --> 09:46.901
Your life's in danger.

09:46.903 --> 09:49.103
You're that fake cop
back at the store.

09:49.105 --> 09:50.104
What?

09:50.106 --> 09:51.239
If you were a real cop,

09:51.241 --> 09:52.807
I'd have been arrested by now.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.509
I guess we're both
good at role-playing.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.643
Beat it.

09:55.645 --> 09:56.844
I'm not going anywhere.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.713
And I'm not going
anywhere with you.

09:58.715 --> 10:01.416
Trust me, lady.
You need my help.

10:01.418 --> 10:02.850
Like a hole in my head.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.720
Keep it moving,
Kush pops. I got this.

10:05.722 --> 10:09.791
Give me the bag while you still
got a chance to get out of this.

10:12.294 --> 10:16.764
All right, fine.
Take the cash.

10:16.766 --> 10:20.568
Good choice.

10:20.570 --> 10:21.903
- [strike]
- [groan]

10:21.905 --> 10:23.938
Thanks.

10:23.940 --> 10:25.206
(Finch)
<i>Mr. Reese?</i>

10:25.208 --> 10:26.474
Have you got our girl?

10:26.476 --> 10:29.711
No. She's definitely
no one's girl.

10:29.713 --> 10:32.580
Well, her number
just came up. Again.

10:32.582 --> 10:35.383
And I think I know why.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.485
Harper isn't who
we thought she was.

10:37.487 --> 10:41.289
She definitely isn't interested
in our help.

10:55.329 --> 10:57.830
<i>(Finch) Mr. Reese, are you
at Harper's dorm room?</i>

10:57.832 --> 11:00.767
Just let myself in.

11:03.804 --> 11:08.074
Finch, in addition
to grand theft,

11:08.076 --> 11:11.244
our gal Harper's been taking up
a collection on campus.

11:11.246 --> 11:12.979
(Finch)
<i>Or whatever her real name is.</i>

11:12.981 --> 11:15.248
I've looked into the issues
with the ex-roomie.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.083
It appears that
the real Harper Rose

11:17.085 --> 11:19.619
took this semester off
for mental health reasons.

11:19.621 --> 11:22.121
Apparently campus housing
doesn't know it yet.

11:22.123 --> 11:23.823
<i>Multiple cell phones,</i>

11:23.825 --> 11:27.260
IDs...

11:27.262 --> 11:29.829
Either she's a serial killer
or a chameleon who

11:29.831 --> 11:32.465
changes her identity
like socks.

11:32.467 --> 11:33.766
Perhaps that's the reason
the Machine

11:33.768 --> 11:34.934
sent us her number again.

23:32.261 --> 23:35.028
for gift cards, money orders
up the Eastern seaboard.

23:35.030 --> 23:37.330
I don't need cash.
I need ones and zeroes.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.499
Get me more gamers.

23:45.973 --> 23:48.008
Ah!

23:48.010 --> 23:49.109
Ow!

23:49.111 --> 23:50.410
Where is she?

23:50.412 --> 23:52.078
I don't--
I don't know, man.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.981
I told you.

24:08.296 --> 24:11.965
Your girl stole from me.

24:11.967 --> 24:13.600
She got too close
to you and Noah

24:13.602 --> 24:16.303
which means she knows things.

24:16.305 --> 24:17.804
Things she shouldn't.

24:17.806 --> 24:19.539
Harper's just some girl
I was hanging out with.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.042
Her name's not Harper.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.211
The girl's a grifter
working fools like you

24:24.213 --> 24:26.279
to get what she wants.

24:26.281 --> 24:27.647
No way.

24:27.649 --> 24:29.049
What about Detective Riley?

24:29.051 --> 24:30.383
How does she know him?

24:30.385 --> 24:33.486
Who?

24:33.488 --> 24:35.455
No, come on, dude.
Come on, come on.

24:35.457 --> 24:39.459
[grunts]
Ah!

24:39.461 --> 24:41.695
I don't know who that is.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.563
I wanna believe you, Trey.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.965
It's 'cause of guys like you

24:44.967 --> 24:47.234
I'm taking my business
to the next level.

24:47.236 --> 24:48.535
It is?

24:48.537 --> 24:50.537
You and your video games.

24:50.539 --> 24:53.306
See, the dispensary owners

24:53.308 --> 24:55.575
have a bank problem.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.645
So they have to
hire guys like me

24:58.647 --> 25:00.680
to protect them
and all that cash.

25:00.682 --> 25:04.551
Then I see guys like you
spend thousands on games.

25:04.553 --> 25:06.887
Warriors of the realm.

25:06.889 --> 25:10.390
Turning real currency,
virtual, cold hard cash

25:10.392 --> 25:12.125
for fake gold.

25:12.127 --> 25:13.860
All I needed to figure out
was how to

25:13.862 --> 25:15.528
turn that into real money again

25:15.530 --> 25:19.366
then transfer it into
a bank account.

25:19.368 --> 25:20.967
Yeah, that's really smart.

25:20.969 --> 25:22.168
Yes, it is.

25:22.170 --> 25:23.937
But now I feel
that's all been jeopardized.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.605
It's not. She's not
gonna say anything.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.073
- No?
- No, she's not.

25:27.075 --> 25:28.608
I hope not.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.211
'Cause if she does,

25:31.213 --> 25:35.081
you won't need to worry about
studying for those finals.

25:41.889 --> 25:43.890
Maybe we should kick
this know-nothing fool.

25:43.892 --> 25:45.525
He got played,
clear and simple.

25:45.527 --> 25:47.293
No.
With Riley in the mix,

25:47.295 --> 25:49.195
she'll be coming back around.

25:49.197 --> 25:53.466
As far as I'm concerned,
they're both loose ends.

26:03.911 --> 26:05.445
You live here?

26:05.447 --> 26:07.680
I own the apartment.

26:07.682 --> 26:10.016
An excellent
non-answer.

26:10.018 --> 26:11.784
What about Captain McConnick?

26:11.786 --> 26:13.086
He work for you?

26:13.088 --> 26:17.457
Detective Riley and I
are partners.

26:17.459 --> 26:19.292
I didn't see that coming.

26:23.264 --> 26:25.565
Harold, I'm gonna
need that cash.

26:25.567 --> 26:27.634
It's all there.

26:27.636 --> 26:30.436
Though the withdrawal put
a sizable dent in our reserves

26:30.438 --> 26:31.704
but I think the lives
of two people

26:31.706 --> 26:34.641
are worth that sacrifice.

26:34.643 --> 26:36.009
Where are you going with that?

26:36.011 --> 26:37.777
Paying off Dominic.

26:37.779 --> 26:39.679
It's the only play
to keep you safe.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.514
I've been in
way deeper than this.

26:41.516 --> 26:42.982
What about Trey?

26:42.984 --> 26:45.451
Does he have as big
of a death wish as you do?

26:45.453 --> 26:47.654
Come on! You guys are
making it seem like

26:47.656 --> 26:49.322
I knew he was
gonna get kidnapped.

26:49.324 --> 26:51.224
Maybe you'll think about someone
other than yourself

26:51.226 --> 26:54.260
next time you steal
from drug dealers.

26:54.262 --> 26:57.030
Don't let her out
of your sight.

26:57.032 --> 27:01.167
He's a real live wire, huh?

27:01.169 --> 27:02.969
CIA or Special Forces?

27:02.971 --> 27:05.438
Mister-- uh,
Detective Riley

27:05.440 --> 27:07.073
is a complicated person.

27:07.075 --> 27:09.676
And you?
What's your story?

27:09.678 --> 27:11.044
You fund some kind of

27:11.046 --> 27:13.479
alternative private
military contractors?

27:13.481 --> 27:14.647
We like to think of what we do

27:14.649 --> 27:17.684
as a community service.

27:17.686 --> 27:19.652
Why?

27:19.654 --> 27:21.120
Why what?

27:21.122 --> 27:22.789
You two are obviously
helping people

27:22.791 --> 27:24.157
on a regular basis.

27:24.159 --> 27:26.826
Exhibit A, this ornately
decorated apartment

27:26.828 --> 27:29.062
that no one lives in.
Which means

27:29.064 --> 27:31.264
you probably have
a boatload of money

27:31.266 --> 27:33.633
and much better things
to do with your time

27:33.635 --> 27:34.701
than to just stick
your neck out

27:34.703 --> 27:36.903
for people you don't know.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.184
So why do it?

27:41.943 --> 27:44.677
Everybody deserves a champion.

27:44.679 --> 27:47.213
Well, where do you get
your information?

27:47.215 --> 27:49.749
I'm good with technology.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.752
[laughs]
A hacker.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.287
You're a guy who needs order.

27:54.289 --> 27:56.155
Coding is good for that.
It channels the OCD.

27:56.157 --> 27:59.959
It fosters the illusion
of control.

27:59.961 --> 28:01.928
You should stop gripping
the wheel so tight.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.696
Try turning into the skid.

28:03.698 --> 28:05.198
Ah!

28:05.200 --> 28:06.899
And you prefer disorder.

28:06.901 --> 28:08.368
Why swim upstream when you can

28:08.370 --> 28:11.137
ride the current all the way
down to the waterfall?

28:11.139 --> 28:13.206
What happens when
you reach the cliff?

28:13.208 --> 28:15.208
I'll let you know
when I get there.

28:15.210 --> 28:19.612
That's an interesting
take on life.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.347
It's freedom.

28:21.349 --> 28:23.549
I steal from criminals
'cause they don't call the cops.

28:23.551 --> 28:25.885
I don't plant roots so
I can bail at a moment's notice.

28:25.887 --> 28:29.222
Sounds more like running.

28:29.224 --> 28:31.624
An antique art deco
engagement ring,

28:31.626 --> 28:33.192
about a karat.

28:33.194 --> 28:34.861
<i>Is it a family heirloom?</i>

28:34.863 --> 28:36.129
It's just a piece of tin
that I stole

28:36.131 --> 28:39.298
from an old lady who tried
to screw me over.

28:42.703 --> 28:44.837
Got anything to eat
around here?

28:56.183 --> 28:57.717
Got something for your boss.

28:57.719 --> 29:01.387
Right there's good.

29:01.389 --> 29:05.158
[opening briefcase]

29:05.160 --> 29:08.327
In exchange for the kid
and for the girl's life.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.997
Don't know what you're
talking about, Detective.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.132
You're welcome to
leave the cash though.

29:19.406 --> 29:20.907
Where's Dominic?

29:20.909 --> 29:22.875
He's unavailable.

29:22.877 --> 29:27.013
But like we said,
you can leave the case.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.449
That's not gonna happen.

29:33.620 --> 29:36.389
I'll take that.

29:54.508 --> 29:57.777
That's my number for your boss
when he's ready to talk.

29:57.779 --> 30:01.247
Or I can keep kicking
his ass from a distance.

30:01.249 --> 30:03.483
Whatever he prefers.

30:16.470 --> 30:17.704
I can't tell you
how excited I am

30:17.706 --> 30:19.372
about what
you've brought to us.

30:19.374 --> 30:21.107
Now you see why
I needed your company.

30:21.109 --> 30:22.442
Yeah, I thought it was
a simple app,

30:22.444 --> 30:24.210
but it's a truly sophisticated

30:24.212 --> 30:26.179
build for a mobile platform.

30:26.181 --> 30:28.948
You, uh,
work with an incubator?

30:28.950 --> 30:30.750
Not on this project.

30:30.752 --> 30:32.352
It's just me.

30:32.354 --> 30:34.654
What type of partnership
are you looking for?

30:34.656 --> 30:37.090
Combining my software
with your compression algorithm

30:37.092 --> 30:38.691
will save me
a lot of time and money

30:38.693 --> 30:41.060
and allow us to sell it
at a lower price point

30:41.062 --> 30:43.196
to the consumer.

30:43.198 --> 30:45.298
If you're interested
in partnering up

30:45.300 --> 30:47.567
on something so small,
of course.

30:47.569 --> 30:50.036
Well, I imagine the boss
will be as impressed as I am

30:50.038 --> 30:51.237
with what you've created.

30:51.239 --> 30:53.039
So, um, why don't I call you

30:53.041 --> 30:54.407
once he weighs in?

30:54.409 --> 30:56.659
I look forward to it.

30:58.580 --> 31:01.581
Tell me something.
Why bring it to us?

31:01.583 --> 31:04.550
You could've gone anywhere.

31:04.552 --> 31:08.542
Your boss's reputation
precedes him.

31:26.607 --> 31:28.975
Got your message...

31:28.977 --> 31:30.576
Detective.

31:30.578 --> 31:33.513
I'll give you
the money you're owed

31:33.515 --> 31:35.748
if you agree to
stay away from Harper.

31:35.750 --> 31:39.318
And I want that kid
back in one piece.

31:39.320 --> 31:40.787
Okay.

31:40.789 --> 31:42.555
It's a deal.

31:42.557 --> 31:45.892
If you decide to tell me
who you really are.

31:45.894 --> 31:51.064
'Cause you're sure as hell
no detective.

31:51.066 --> 31:53.499
Well, you saw my card.

31:53.501 --> 31:55.635
- [laughs]
- It says John Riley,

31:55.637 --> 31:58.304
Homicide Detective.

31:58.306 --> 32:00.206
That's me.

32:00.208 --> 32:01.741
No real cop would
pay off the debt

32:01.743 --> 32:06.145
of some homeless grifter.

32:06.447 --> 32:08.714
I'm not like other cops.

32:08.716 --> 32:11.902
We finally agree on something.

32:14.422 --> 32:16.855
You and me,

32:16.857 --> 32:18.557
this isn't personal.

32:18.559 --> 32:20.793
It's just that you keep
trying to hurt people

32:20.795 --> 32:24.530
and I don't like it
when people get hurt.

32:24.532 --> 32:26.865
Why does Elias get a pass?

32:26.867 --> 32:29.034
Well, he and I
have an understanding.

32:29.036 --> 32:32.438
He stays out of my way
and I stay out of his.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.439
That right?

32:33.441 --> 32:34.740
That's right.

32:34.742 --> 32:37.810
That's how it works with Elias.

32:37.812 --> 32:39.745
But you already know that.

32:39.747 --> 32:42.548
Just like you know
he's coming for you.

32:42.550 --> 32:44.383
I'll be ready.

32:44.385 --> 32:46.218
But as for us,

32:46.220 --> 32:50.089
if I stay out of your way,
you'll show me the same respect?

32:50.091 --> 32:53.726
As long as you stop trying
to kill innocent people.

32:53.728 --> 32:55.027
The girl's not innocent.

32:55.029 --> 32:57.382
Well, that's up for debate.

32:59.500 --> 33:02.301
How about I give you Trey
and you give me the girl?

33:05.772 --> 33:09.441
That's not gonna happen.

33:09.443 --> 33:11.243
[exhales]

33:21.454 --> 33:23.956
(Fusco)
<i>I got him.</i>

33:26.292 --> 33:27.826
He pulls anything stupid,

33:27.828 --> 33:32.331
I'll pull the trigger.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.032
Which one is it?

33:34.034 --> 33:35.868
One of the pretty
little brunettes

33:35.870 --> 33:39.705
or your partner
Detective Fusco?

33:39.707 --> 33:42.708
[laughs]

33:42.710 --> 33:44.410
You're not gonna
kill an unarmed man.

33:44.412 --> 33:45.878
I know that much.

33:45.880 --> 33:50.382
So I guess this
little talk is over...

33:50.384 --> 33:52.985
for now.

33:56.956 --> 34:00.125
You can stand down now.

34:00.127 --> 34:02.561
Looks like your little parlay
didn't do us much good.

34:02.563 --> 34:04.430
Harper's still in trouble and
her stoner boyfriend's

34:04.432 --> 34:06.064
probably dead.

34:06.066 --> 34:08.333
Always looking on
the bright side, aren't you?

34:08.335 --> 34:12.271
(Fusco) <i>Okay, Detective
Sunshine, what do we do now?</i>

34:12.572 --> 34:14.940
So that tall drink
of darkness failed

34:14.942 --> 34:16.975
to dazzle Dominic
with his witty banter

34:16.976 --> 34:18.310
and a briefcase full of cash.

34:18.312 --> 34:19.578
We'll discuss our next option

34:19.580 --> 34:20.946
when he gets back.

34:20.947 --> 34:23.148
It'll be too late.
You know how these guys work.

34:23.150 --> 34:26.618
Shoot first, don't ask questions
later because the person's dead.

34:26.620 --> 34:28.954
I put my life at risk
knowing the stakes.

34:28.956 --> 34:30.355
Trey didn't.

34:30.357 --> 34:32.224
So, I'm gonna rescue that dummy

34:32.226 --> 34:34.559
with or without you guys.

34:34.561 --> 34:37.963
I'll have a much better chance
if I got some backup.

34:37.965 --> 34:40.273
What do you propose?

34:42.235 --> 34:45.437
You're good with
technology, right?

34:51.777 --> 34:56.614
- <i>Girl</i> wants a word.
- Send her over.

35:04.657 --> 35:07.225
I knew you had <i>balls,</i> but I
didn't know you were stupid.

35:07.227 --> 35:09.261
Don't be so mad, Alfonso.

35:09.263 --> 35:11.696
You got his nephew in
a lot of trouble, little girl.

35:11.698 --> 35:13.098
You set him up to fail.

35:13.100 --> 35:15.400
Cops got involved.
He got shot.

35:15.402 --> 35:17.341
I'm gonna make it up to you.

35:19.973 --> 35:22.440
Nico, <i>boss,</i>

35:22.442 --> 35:26.178
I have no interest in starting
a war with the cartel.

35:26.180 --> 35:29.047
I like the way my head looks
attached to my shoulders.

35:29.049 --> 35:30.916
Oh! Should have waited
for Detective Riley.

35:30.918 --> 35:34.219
Dominic's been consolidating
power in this town.

35:34.221 --> 35:35.787
Half the gangs work
for him now.

35:35.789 --> 35:37.088
Tell me something I don't know.

35:37.090 --> 35:38.490
You guys are losing money
hand over fist

35:38.492 --> 35:41.793
with this
legalization nonsense.

35:41.795 --> 35:44.095
You want what's rightfully
yours; let me help you get it.

35:44.097 --> 35:45.397
How to you plan to do that?

35:45.399 --> 35:46.965
Dominic's laundering cash.

35:46.967 --> 35:48.733
A lot of it.
And he can only do that

35:48.735 --> 35:51.803
one small chunk at a time
or the feds will catch on.

35:51.805 --> 35:52.938
Do you know what that means?

35:52.940 --> 35:54.673
He needs to keep
the cash somewhere.

35:54.675 --> 35:56.107
Bingo.

35:56.109 --> 35:57.576
And not just hundreds
of thousands,

35:57.578 --> 36:01.146
but tens of millions.

36:01.148 --> 36:05.217
Alfonso...
<i>put the gun down.</i>

36:10.223 --> 36:12.190
You got my attention.
What do you need?

36:12.192 --> 36:13.792
Have your boys put
the word out on the street

36:13.794 --> 36:15.493
that you found me.

36:15.495 --> 36:17.095
Dominic will have no choice
but to reach out

36:17.097 --> 36:19.397
to make a deal.

36:19.399 --> 36:22.067
Then you leave
the rest up to me.

36:42.139 --> 36:45.041
(Finch) <i>Nice job, Ms. Harper.
The cartel took you straight to</i>

36:45.043 --> 36:48.578
<i>Dominic's stronghold,</i>
<i>just as you thought.</i>

36:48.580 --> 36:51.745
If you're wrong,
you're dead wrong.

36:52.784 --> 36:55.184
Finch, Harper's inside with
the cartel.

36:55.186 --> 36:57.320
I'm moving into position.

37:00.624 --> 37:03.159
(man)
Hey, I've got something in here.

37:03.161 --> 37:04.760
What now?

37:04.762 --> 37:06.229
I need to get to the roof.

37:06.231 --> 37:07.530
It's the only way
to get to Trey

37:07.532 --> 37:08.931
without busting
through the warehouse.

37:08.933 --> 37:11.033
You really going along
with the con girl's plan?

37:11.035 --> 37:13.069
Finch trusts her.

37:13.071 --> 37:14.237
Sort of.

37:14.239 --> 37:15.938
That's a real
vote of confidence.

37:23.647 --> 37:25.248
Where's the money?

37:25.250 --> 37:27.196
What money?

37:41.765 --> 37:42.698
Whoa.

37:42.700 --> 37:44.533
You don't want to
do this, Nico.

37:44.535 --> 37:46.569
We agreed to a trade.

37:46.571 --> 37:48.638
I know, but there's a problem.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.373
I've got nothing to trade.

37:50.375 --> 37:53.876
Had the money taken to
a more secure location.

37:59.816 --> 38:02.018
What?

38:02.020 --> 38:03.419
That was cool.

38:03.421 --> 38:06.589
Hey, Trey.
I'm John.

38:06.991 --> 38:08.257
Dude, I hope you're here
to rescue me

38:08.259 --> 38:11.794
because these dudes
are not messing around.

38:11.796 --> 38:13.162
Your friend Harper sent me.

38:13.164 --> 38:14.363
Huh...

38:14.365 --> 38:17.199
I knew she was into me.

38:22.305 --> 38:25.407
[police sirens]

38:25.409 --> 38:26.842
You set us up!

38:28.745 --> 38:30.312
Dude, what is this for?

38:30.314 --> 38:31.680
- You ready?
- For what?

38:31.682 --> 38:35.818
- Hang on.
- Awesome!

38:35.820 --> 38:37.820
Wait, what happens now?

38:37.822 --> 38:41.323
[sirens wailing]

38:49.999 --> 38:51.166
Cool.

38:51.168 --> 38:53.736
(police officer)
Drop it! On the ground now!

38:53.738 --> 38:56.004
Get down!
Hands where I can see them!

38:56.006 --> 38:58.440
Stay where you are!
On your knees!

38:58.442 --> 38:59.493
Move!

39:01.178 --> 39:02.277
What did we do?

39:02.279 --> 39:03.879
The serial number's filed off.

39:03.881 --> 39:05.481
That's one felony.

39:05.483 --> 39:06.548
I'll think of some more

39:06.550 --> 39:07.583
on our way to the station.

39:07.585 --> 39:08.584
You're welcome to inspect

39:08.586 --> 39:09.952
our weapons, Detective.

39:09.954 --> 39:11.086
They're all registered for use

39:11.088 --> 39:12.421
under my private security,

39:12.423 --> 39:14.623
protection, and
transportation service.

39:14.625 --> 39:16.362
Squeaky clean, huh?

39:20.130 --> 39:22.831
These guys can go.
Check these weapons.

39:31.241 --> 39:33.742
Got a call from Noah.

39:33.744 --> 39:37.412
Appreciate the heads up.

39:37.414 --> 39:39.882
What's your angle?

39:39.884 --> 39:41.250
I figured you'd stop
trying to kill me

39:41.252 --> 39:42.885
if I proved myself.

39:42.887 --> 39:44.153
Getting rid of the cartel

39:44.155 --> 39:46.121
seemed liked a good deal
for both of us.

39:46.123 --> 39:48.323
Especially 'cause
they wanted me dead too.

39:48.325 --> 39:49.291
We good now?

39:49.293 --> 39:50.659
For now.

39:50.661 --> 39:52.227
What about Trey?

39:52.229 --> 39:55.297
This was never
about him anyway.

39:55.299 --> 40:00.002
[laughs] You wanted
a face to face.

40:00.004 --> 40:01.069
With me.

40:01.071 --> 40:03.305
A lady bold enough
to steal from the cartel

40:03.307 --> 40:04.807
and my guys,

40:04.809 --> 40:08.243
and clever enough to
get away with it,

40:08.245 --> 40:10.746
makes you a force to
be reckoned with.

40:10.748 --> 40:13.059
Someone I could use on my team.

40:14.852 --> 40:16.251
Whenever you're done
playing vigilante

40:16.253 --> 40:18.968
with that fake cop,
come see me.

40:19.890 --> 40:21.713
Where's the kid?

40:27.330 --> 40:28.964
Harp!

40:33.236 --> 40:35.671
I'm happy you're okay, Trey.

40:35.673 --> 40:38.607
But I think we
need to break up.

40:38.609 --> 40:39.942
What?

40:44.747 --> 40:47.015
What did I do?

40:47.017 --> 40:48.717
Don't try to figure them out.

40:48.719 --> 40:50.520
Come on.
I'll give you a ride.

40:57.861 --> 40:59.928
Your app is truly special,
Shannon.

40:59.930 --> 41:03.165
The code-- it's the most elegant
string I've seen in years.

41:03.167 --> 41:06.301
I-I really
appreciate the support.

41:06.303 --> 41:08.003
This is, like, a dream.

41:08.005 --> 41:10.672
Just being in the room
with the great Caleb Fitz.

41:10.674 --> 41:12.341
Aw, you give me
too much credit.

41:12.343 --> 41:14.556
Please. Sit.

41:16.046 --> 41:18.213
So, where did you
learn to code?

41:18.215 --> 41:21.316
I-I'm kind of
self taught.

41:21.318 --> 41:24.720
Me too. I think most of
the best programmers are.

41:24.722 --> 41:28.056
I told Shannon you wanted to
discuss something else with her.

41:28.058 --> 41:30.893
Yes.
Down to business.

41:30.895 --> 41:32.828
We were wondering if
you have any interest

41:32.830 --> 41:37.232
in working on something
with a team.

41:37.234 --> 41:38.967
You mean for you?

41:38.969 --> 41:41.370
I never considered
myself in that league.

41:41.372 --> 41:42.804
You absolutely are.

41:42.806 --> 41:45.140
It's for a new security
software we're developing

41:45.142 --> 41:47.910
and we could really use
someone with your skills.

41:47.912 --> 41:49.658
So what do you think?

41:50.915 --> 41:53.315
I'd be honored.

42:04.627 --> 42:06.461
You guys were right.

42:06.463 --> 42:08.263
I totally needed backup.

42:08.265 --> 42:10.499
Maybe you should stay
out of trouble for a while,

42:10.501 --> 42:11.767
Ms. Harper.

42:11.769 --> 42:13.952
What's the fun in that?

42:16.006 --> 42:19.241
You are a good man, Harold.

42:23.012 --> 42:24.279
And you,

42:24.281 --> 42:25.914
thanks for reminding me that
it's not just

42:25.916 --> 42:28.483
my ass on the line.

42:28.485 --> 42:31.019
- [car honks]
- [collision]

42:31.021 --> 42:33.889
[men screaming indistinctly]

42:38.127 --> 42:39.962
Finch?

42:39.964 --> 42:42.764
I think she just
stole your watch.

42:42.766 --> 42:47.135
Oh, that's okay.
I stole her ring.

42:47.137 --> 42:48.337
She knows where to find me

42:48.339 --> 42:50.033
if she wants it back.
