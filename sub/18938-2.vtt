of uh a, a confession

00:10.172 --> 00:11.463
for the group.

00:11.463 --> 00:13.713
I used the...

00:13.713 --> 00:15.963
the C word with my 4-year-old.

00:15.963 --> 00:17.797
- The C word?

00:17.797 --> 00:19.297
- Yeah, I got this, Jenny.

00:19.297 --> 00:21.505
Uh, she called her son a cunt.

00:21.505 --> 00:23.630
- (Baby fusses)
- What?!

00:23.630 --> 00:26.130
- Why would Alicia ever call
her child that word?

00:26.130 --> 00:28.797
- I don't know, cause kids can
be sort of annoying sometimes.

00:29.838 --> 00:33.213
- Can't!
I used the word can't.

00:33.213 --> 00:35.088
- Wait, why can't say "can't".

00:35.088 --> 00:38.880
- Kate, many moms find
the C word overly negative.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.255
- And the N word.

00:40.255 --> 00:43.172
- Who's using the N word?!
- Oh you'd be surprised.

00:43.172 --> 00:45.172
- My barber calls me
the N word.

00:45.172 --> 00:47.005
But I can tell he means it
lovingly.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.797
- Okay. Let me clarify.

00:49.797 --> 00:53.005
"No" is the N word. No.

00:53.005 --> 00:54.463
- Well, we can't say no?

00:54.463 --> 00:56.255
How the hell are we supposed
to set boundaries?

00:56.255 --> 00:57.588

- Go ahead, Jenny,

00:59.630 --> 01:01.963

to raise your hand.

milk as you need,
