WEBVTT

00:15.333 --> 00:17.416
-Whoa!

00:19.541 --> 00:21.250
Ah!

00:26.875 --> 00:28.500
-Ah! No!
-Huh?

00:30.625 --> 00:31.458
Ah!

00:32.583 --> 00:33.416
Ouch!

00:43.291 --> 00:44.375
Phew.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.958
-Hey!

00:57.791 --> 00:59.041
There.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.291
Every single piece of evidence
for the disappearance of Jennifer Swan.

01:02.375 --> 01:03.291
What do you think?

01:03.375 --> 01:05.041
Could you just zoom out a bit?

01:05.125 --> 01:06.250
Oh, sure.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.958
Today's the day we solve it.

01:09.041 --> 01:11.750
She was in the In-between
and we got out of there alive,

01:11.833 --> 01:13.291
so maybe she can, too.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.041
Oh, good thinking.

01:15.125 --> 01:16.500
Yeah!

01:16.583 --> 01:18.708
Well, you have fun with that.

01:18.791 --> 01:20.750
Wait, you're not going to help?

01:20.833 --> 01:24.916
Ugh, I'd love to, but I kinda have
that thing with my family.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.458
Hopefully I can smooth things out.

01:27.541 --> 01:28.958
I can't wait to get my scratches!

01:29.041 --> 01:31.291
Are you sure you don't
want to tell them you can talk?

01:31.375 --> 01:32.291
Scratches first.

01:32.375 --> 01:35.333
Mom and Dad know
how to scratch my belly just right.

01:35.416 --> 01:37.583
Hey, what's wrong with my scratches?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.083
Oh, your scratches are fine.

01:50.166 --> 01:51.750
Fine?

01:51.833 --> 01:53.375
-Uh, Courtney!

01:53.458 --> 01:54.666
Want to help me solve a…

01:55.500 --> 01:57.916
-What's that?
-Sorry, busy!

01:58.000 --> 02:00.083
Stuff. Laters.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.166
Fine, I'll do this on my own.

02:09.250 --> 02:12.000
On your own?
Want company? What are we doing?

02:12.083 --> 02:13.916
Uh, you wouldn't be interested.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.500
I'm solving a disappearance.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.041
Possibly a murder.

02:17.125 --> 02:20.791
If investigating a murder is the only way
to hang out with you, then fine!

02:20.875 --> 02:22.541
Where are we heading first, boss?

02:22.625 --> 02:23.916
Uh, to meet an informant.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.583
And I suppose every great detective
has to have a sidekick.

02:27.666 --> 02:29.291
You mean partner.

02:29.375 --> 02:30.625
No, I don't.

02:49.833 --> 02:50.708
Barney!

02:52.666 --> 02:53.583
Patrick!

02:54.666 --> 02:55.750
-Hey!

02:55.833 --> 02:58.458
-Pugsley!
-Uh, hi…

03:06.333 --> 03:09.291
I'll get you good, Justifer Jones!

03:09.958 --> 03:11.541
-Oh! Yah!

03:15.041 --> 03:19.250
-So, uh, how have you been?
-Uh, Pugsley can talk!

03:19.333 --> 03:20.750
-Barney!
-Pugsley!

03:20.833 --> 03:22.291
-Mom!
-Patrick!

03:24.875 --> 03:25.750
Bread?

03:39.666 --> 03:40.916
Thank you for coming, Vince.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.875
Thank you for calling my teacher
and pretending to be my mom.

03:44.791 --> 03:45.750
So you believe me now?

03:45.833 --> 03:47.875
I believe in examining
all possible evidence.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.166
However dubious.

03:58.291 --> 04:02.125
You know, this looks way more suspicious
than if you just talk face-to-face.

04:05.708 --> 04:08.583
Whatever you do,
don't trust anybody.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.500
Thank you. It's good to know
there's someone here I can trust.

04:14.916 --> 04:16.666
So, what's the magazine?

04:16.750 --> 04:21.750
Uh, well, Pauline's
former stunt double, Barborah Winslow,

04:21.833 --> 04:24.291
claimed that she was
the real Pauline for years,

04:24.375 --> 04:25.791
that she stole her career.

04:25.875 --> 04:29.291
The two used to be inseparable,
but they fell out filming some TV ad.

04:29.375 --> 04:32.041
And what's she got to do
with Jennifer's disappearance?

04:32.125 --> 04:33.666
Barborah is crazy.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.125
She hates Pauline.

04:35.208 --> 04:38.458
Maybe she wanted to blackmail her
by kidnapping an employee

04:38.541 --> 04:42.833
or maybe Barborah kidnapped
Jennifer thinking that she was Pauline.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.375
Uh, Norma,
I think it's pronounced Barbara.

04:45.458 --> 04:46.708
It's written Barborah.

04:46.791 --> 04:48.125
Barborah isn't a name.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.875
Well, whatever. I hate her.

04:49.958 --> 04:52.333
She spent her life
trying to bring down Pauline.

04:52.416 --> 04:54.250
So she's my primary suspect.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.708
I don't know. Jennifer was so nice.

04:56.791 --> 04:59.083
It's hard to think anybody
would do that over a feud.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.458
Wait. You knew her?

05:00.541 --> 05:03.708
Well, yeah, I do that employee
initiation day for everyone.

05:03.791 --> 05:04.916
Even the impersonators.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.375
Do you remember
the last thing Jennifer said to you?

05:07.458 --> 05:09.291
Sure, she said…

05:10.166 --> 05:11.208
"Bye!"

05:11.291 --> 05:12.708
Before that!

05:12.791 --> 05:15.208
Hmm, "I've gotta go now."

05:15.291 --> 05:17.625
Badyah, can you rewind a little more?

05:17.708 --> 05:20.875
She said… Oh! "Hi. My name is Jennifer."

05:21.708 --> 05:24.125
Okay, so I didn't know her that well!

05:24.208 --> 05:25.583
Do you know who did?

05:31.333 --> 05:35.541
<i>It's the best, most expensive</i>
<i>life insurance option on the market.</i>

05:35.625 --> 05:37.958
<i>I'm fine. Just a scratch!</i>

05:38.041 --> 05:40.208
-What was that?
-Hey, Norma, you coming?

05:45.791 --> 05:49.500
<i>Welcome, darlings,</i>
<i>to the Hall of Ex-Husbands!</i>

05:49.583 --> 05:55.166
<i>Husband number one,</i>
<i>tiger dentist Chester Cole!</i>

05:55.250 --> 06:00.333
<i>Husband number two,</i>
<i>baked bean mogul Clinton Jones.</i>

06:01.000 --> 06:06.375
<i>Husband number three,</i>
<i>Swedish pop sensation Jonas Tornqvist.</i>

06:06.458 --> 06:09.375
<i>Could never wrap my tongue</i>
<i>around that one!</i>

06:09.458 --> 06:14.375
<i>Husband number four, well,</i>
<i>it's our old pal Chester Cole again,</i>

06:14.458 --> 06:17.708
<i>back from faking his own death</i>
<i>for tax purposes.</i>

06:17.791 --> 06:22.958
<i>Unfortunately for him, he forgot</i>
<i>his parachute the second time around.</i>

06:23.041 --> 06:26.125
No!

06:30.125 --> 06:32.166
Forget about diamonds!

06:32.250 --> 06:34.916
Prenups are a girl's best friend,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.500
and maybe, one day, you too

06:37.583 --> 06:41.500
can be an ex-husband of Pauline Phoenix!

06:50.125 --> 06:52.875
Norma, wait, it's her wedding day!

06:59.916 --> 07:01.666
-Ouch!

07:01.750 --> 07:05.000
Excuse me. This is a Paulines-only area!

07:05.083 --> 07:07.583
Gold pass and I have questions.

07:08.250 --> 07:11.041
No, none of us
are the real Pauline!

07:11.125 --> 07:13.250
Though some of us act like we are.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.125
Don't be jealous
just because I'm her favorite.

07:16.208 --> 07:18.458
No, it's about Jennifer Swan.

07:20.791 --> 07:22.583
Second favorite then.

07:22.666 --> 07:25.666
Pauline had her eyes
on Jennifer from the day she started.

07:25.750 --> 07:26.708
What do you mean?

07:26.791 --> 07:29.000
Pauline watches us like a hawk.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.791
She checks our every move.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.250
She watches you?

07:32.333 --> 07:34.750
Oh, yes. She ranks us from best to worst.

07:34.833 --> 07:37.916
Making sure we pull off
her flawlessness flawlessly.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.250
And when you reach the top,
the reward is to die for.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.458
So, how does she track you?

07:45.541 --> 07:48.791
You're holding it,
but keep it to yourself, darling.

07:56.791 --> 07:59.916
Ow!

08:00.000 --> 08:01.250
What would you like, sweetie?

08:01.333 --> 08:04.833
Hmm. I kind of want
the High Noon hamburger,

08:04.916 --> 08:09.250
but I know you guys would rather
I have a Say Your Prayers salad.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.333
You live your authentic truth, honey.

08:11.416 --> 08:14.875
If having the burger makes you happy,
we fully support you.

08:14.958 --> 08:16.000
Ugh.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.000
Are you rolling your eyes at your mother?

08:18.083 --> 08:19.541
She says she supports you.

08:24.375 --> 08:27.375
Uh, waiter,
can I get a glass of toilet water?

08:29.416 --> 08:32.166
'Cause I'm a dog.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.000
Oh, oh, oh. Mmm.

08:35.083 --> 08:37.083
Whoa… More.

08:40.541 --> 08:42.500
July 22nd, 7:15 a.m.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.000
She enters the park.

08:44.083 --> 08:47.291
7:20, skinny latte
from the Main Street coffee machine.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.250
-7:25, Scare Square.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.458
Wow. This is so creepy and thorough.

08:53.291 --> 08:54.250
And there!

08:54.333 --> 08:57.250
Dead End lobby, stairs, hallways,

08:57.333 --> 09:00.458
Hall of Mirrors, and then nothing?

09:01.125 --> 09:03.875
It's like we thought. She just vanished.

09:03.958 --> 09:06.291
Who else would have been
in Dead End that day?

09:10.333 --> 09:14.500
Courtney,
would you care for another cup of gravel?

09:14.583 --> 09:17.166
Oh, you're too kind, Barney.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.750
Two sugars?

09:18.833 --> 09:20.500
Please.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.583
There you go, dear.

09:22.666 --> 09:25.083
So kind of you.

09:25.166 --> 09:28.791
Oh, please,
it is my absolute pleasure.

09:28.875 --> 09:31.583
-You are such a delight.
-Uh, Courtney?

09:31.666 --> 09:33.708
Oh, uh, hello!

09:33.791 --> 09:36.000
I guess we don't knock
on this plane anymore.

09:36.083 --> 09:40.958
Aw, are you scared that Barney meeting
his parents means he's gonna move out?

09:41.041 --> 09:44.125
Oh! That is so adorable and tragic.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.708
I got used to having roomies, okay?

09:46.791 --> 09:49.250
Haven't met anybody else
in this dump for a year.

09:49.333 --> 09:53.458
I started talking to myself
and, man, I'm so rude.

09:54.583 --> 09:56.666
So, you were here
when Jennifer disappeared?

09:56.750 --> 09:58.666
Sure.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.375
I didn't do it,
if that's what you're asking.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.083
We can't rule out any suspect.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.875
Oh, I'm hurt, Norma.

10:05.958 --> 10:06.916
I'm bleeding.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.833
The day we met you,
you tried to sacrifice us to a demon king.

10:09.916 --> 10:13.333
But I've had so much
character development since then!

10:13.416 --> 10:16.125
Tell us everything you know
about Jennifer's disappearance,

10:16.208 --> 10:19.250
or we tell everyone
about your little tea party.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.125
Fine!

10:23.875 --> 10:26.041
So, she ran up these stairs.

10:30.541 --> 10:32.708
And, uh, then she ran through here.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.875
And then she turned this way.

10:50.291 --> 10:51.208
Courtney!

10:53.916 --> 10:54.958
Are you okay?

10:55.041 --> 10:57.958
Uh, yeah,
we're doing a re-creation, right?

10:58.041 --> 11:02.458
So, she went through this door
and then she was like…

11:02.541 --> 11:04.208
You didn't go to see what was happening?

11:04.291 --> 11:05.958
What was chasing her?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.375
My toast had just popped.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.833
-I had other plans.

11:10.875 --> 11:14.166
And those Pauline look-alikes
go missing all the time.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.833
I didn't realize it was a big deal.

11:15.916 --> 11:17.666
Ugh, Courtney. That's so…

11:17.750 --> 11:18.708
Wait, what?

11:18.791 --> 11:21.083
Ain't you seen the posters?

11:26.500 --> 11:28.916
Pauline is doing
a concert in the park!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.333
Oh, my ghosts! Do we get free tickets?

11:31.416 --> 11:32.625
Norma, focus!

11:39.500 --> 11:41.916
See, they all disappear eventually.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.166
Norma, how did we not know this?

11:45.083 --> 11:47.875
"Any information,
please speak to the chief custodian."

11:49.708 --> 11:52.458
Oh, uh, uh, you have it.

11:52.541 --> 11:53.708
No, you.

11:53.791 --> 11:55.333
No. You have it.

11:55.416 --> 11:56.958
No, you have it.

11:57.041 --> 11:58.875
Please. I insist.

11:58.958 --> 12:00.666
Just take the lousy nacho, Barney!

12:00.750 --> 12:02.750
Saul, calm down, please!

12:02.833 --> 12:04.416
Oh, that's right.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.375
I should be more upfront
about what I need.

12:07.458 --> 12:11.083
And what you need is a nacho?

12:11.166 --> 12:14.166
Anyhow,
I was so happy you invited us--

12:14.250 --> 12:16.375
Look, you say I can have the nachos,

12:16.458 --> 12:17.916
but then I get the nachos

12:18.000 --> 12:20.708
and you start talking about
how you wish I got the broccoli.

12:20.791 --> 12:21.791
What are you talking about?

12:21.875 --> 12:25.750
We gave you nachos and the mozzarella dips
and the cheese fries!

12:25.833 --> 12:27.750
We've let you have everything you want.

12:27.833 --> 12:30.750
Some kids don't have
half as many nachos as you do!

12:30.833 --> 12:32.666
Sit down, why don't you?

12:32.750 --> 12:34.166
Your father is right.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.291
You could be a little more thankful.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.750
Am I supposed to thank you for everything?

12:39.833 --> 12:42.000
Oh, thank you for these cheese fries.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.708
Oh, thank you for the cornbread.

12:43.791 --> 12:47.166
It's divine.
Thanks for giving birth to me!

12:47.250 --> 12:49.416
You're welcome! It wasn't easy, you know!

12:49.500 --> 12:51.416
What's this got to do with nachos?

13:03.583 --> 13:05.166
Uh, excuse me.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.208
Uh, Miss Custodian Lady?

13:08.291 --> 13:10.833
What? Can't you see I'm busy?

13:10.916 --> 13:14.500
It's about
the disappearances, uh, before Jennifer.

13:15.666 --> 13:18.125
Why are all those
Pauline impersonators missing?

13:19.333 --> 13:20.750
They're not.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.833
But the posters!

13:23.916 --> 13:27.458
Have you looked at 'em?
Really looked at 'em?

13:27.541 --> 13:30.875
Don't those faces look familiar to you?

13:30.958 --> 13:35.708
Oh, my ghosts,
it's them.

13:35.791 --> 13:37.750
<i>The Pauline impersonators.</i>

13:37.833 --> 13:39.666
Nice observation.

13:39.750 --> 13:40.833
Nice compliment.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.416
But why didn't they mention it to us?

13:43.500 --> 13:44.625
'Cause they're scared.

13:44.708 --> 13:47.750
I've tried talking to them,
but they don't want to listen!

13:47.833 --> 13:50.541
This goes all the way to the top!

13:50.625 --> 13:52.000
To the top?

13:52.083 --> 13:56.041
Okay. So, first, Jennifer Swan
disappears on a radar,

13:56.125 --> 13:58.833
then that weird insurance ad
is playing at the museum

13:58.916 --> 14:01.458
and, finally,
missing people aren't missing?

14:01.541 --> 14:02.958
Nothing's making sense!

14:03.041 --> 14:04.083
Insurance ad?

14:04.166 --> 14:05.208
I know, right?

14:05.291 --> 14:07.583
I've seen every single second
of Pauline's catalog,

14:07.666 --> 14:09.000
but I never saw that.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.208
I… I have to go.

14:13.416 --> 14:16.458
-I got a shift at the museum.

14:19.916 --> 14:22.583
Look, I don't care
about the mozzarella dip.

14:22.666 --> 14:25.458
-I don't care about the fries!
-Of course you don't.

14:25.541 --> 14:28.750
-I can't believe we stayed here for this.
-You're so ungrateful!

14:28.833 --> 14:30.375
Can you guys all cool it?

14:30.458 --> 14:32.666
We can order more nachos!

14:37.708 --> 14:40.750
I don't get it. We accepted you.

14:40.833 --> 14:43.291
That is what parents are supposed to do.

14:43.375 --> 14:45.250
That's the bare minimum.

14:46.083 --> 14:47.666
What about that dinner?

14:47.750 --> 14:49.291
What dinner?

14:49.375 --> 14:51.833
You know what dinner.

14:51.916 --> 14:55.625
You just let Grammy Gram
say all that stuff to me right to my face!

14:55.708 --> 14:58.833
Oh, honey buns.
We all know Grammy Grams is difficult.

14:58.916 --> 15:00.416
Does it matter what she says?

15:00.500 --> 15:04.291
Uh, yeah, and what's worse,
you didn't even stand up for me!

15:04.375 --> 15:06.041
Oh, she wouldn't understand.

15:06.125 --> 15:08.000
-You don't understand!

15:10.250 --> 15:14.041
Sir, if you're gonna do that again,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

15:14.125 --> 15:15.750
But everyone else was doing it.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.041
They're actors.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.541
Well, that's just confusing.

15:20.625 --> 15:22.125
Yeah, you're setting a bad example.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.208
Agreed.

15:28.208 --> 15:29.291
Barney!

15:29.375 --> 15:30.875
Norma?

15:30.958 --> 15:32.916
Barney, we figured it out!

15:33.000 --> 15:36.083
Excuse me.
We're having a family discussion.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.291
Oh, sorry, we didn't mean to--

15:38.375 --> 15:39.708
So are we.

15:49.208 --> 15:51.416
Come along, Patrick.

15:55.291 --> 15:59.375
Look, guys. I apologize
for running away and not telling you.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.750
-That was wrong.
-Then come home.

16:02.833 --> 16:04.125
You've…

16:04.208 --> 16:05.833
You've got to make it one first.

16:12.708 --> 16:14.500
Hey, you can have this if you want.

16:21.875 --> 16:26.083
So, after an extensive
and very thorough investigation,

16:26.166 --> 16:28.250
I think it's obvious
the culprit is none other

16:28.333 --> 16:31.208
than Pauline's ex-stunt double Barborah.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.166
What?

16:32.250 --> 16:34.208
-Norma, really?

16:34.291 --> 16:35.666
Well, who else could it be?

16:35.750 --> 16:36.958
Pauline!

16:37.041 --> 16:38.083
What?

16:38.166 --> 16:39.791
She's tracking everyone's movements.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.833
All the victims are her look-alikes.

16:41.916 --> 16:43.791
She has access to the whole park.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.541
She's a rich white lady,
and they can be the worst.

16:46.625 --> 16:49.750
It's obviously Pauline, so case closed.

16:49.833 --> 16:53.416
No, case not closed
because Jennifer Swan is still missing.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.583
Um, are you sure?

16:57.458 --> 16:59.750
Jennifer? Jennifer Swan?

16:59.833 --> 17:03.833
Uh, well, honey,
'round here, they call me Pauline.

17:03.916 --> 17:05.333
You want an autograph?

17:05.416 --> 17:07.750
What I'd like is an explanation,
Jennifer Swan.

17:07.833 --> 17:10.625
Have we met?

17:10.708 --> 17:12.000
Yes! In the In-between.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.958
Where have you been?
Who took you? Was it Barborah?

17:15.041 --> 17:17.541
I can't say! She told me not to.

17:17.625 --> 17:20.458
And I never would anyway.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.166
-I got--
-Who said that?

17:22.250 --> 17:23.416
That's it.

17:24.583 --> 17:25.541
Out!

17:25.625 --> 17:26.750
Huh?

17:27.541 --> 17:28.791
Oh.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.291
Are you okay, Norma?

17:32.375 --> 17:34.000
I need to be alone.

17:35.458 --> 17:36.500
Norma!

17:37.750 --> 17:40.291
For what it's worth,
you make a pretty good detective.

17:40.375 --> 17:44.041
And you make
a pretty good sidekick.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.041
Hey, you okay?

18:09.125 --> 18:11.666
No. You?

18:11.750 --> 18:13.583
Nope.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.625
Oh, you left this at the restaurant.

18:18.250 --> 18:21.500
At least we can draw a line
under the whole Jennifer thing.

18:21.583 --> 18:22.875
No one's missing after all.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.791
Funny how
sometimes the things we're looking for

18:26.875 --> 18:28.250
are right in front of us.

18:28.333 --> 18:29.750
Wait a minute!

18:30.833 --> 18:32.791
Really looked at 'em?

18:32.875 --> 18:34.000
Insurance ad?

18:37.041 --> 18:38.833
I got a shift at the museum.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.083
The museum!

18:41.166 --> 18:43.875
Norma, wait.
What's going on at the museum?

18:52.791 --> 18:54.541
The custodian.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.291
Why don't you call her
by her real name. Barborah!

18:57.375 --> 18:58.833
Thank you.

18:58.916 --> 19:00.958
Everybody calls me Barbara.

19:01.041 --> 19:04.166
You've been kidnapping
impersonators to blackmail Pauline

19:04.250 --> 19:06.500
and turned away anybody
who's come sniffing.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.083
You used to be her friend,

19:08.166 --> 19:10.416
but ever since you fell out
shooting that commercial,

19:10.500 --> 19:12.208
you've tried to take Pauline down!

19:12.291 --> 19:14.791
Oh, you don't know Pauline.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.750
She took everything from me.

19:17.833 --> 19:21.458
I've spent years searching for
that stupid ad to prove who she really is.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.166
It's hidden somewhere here,

19:24.250 --> 19:25.750
and I'm gonna find it,

19:25.833 --> 19:27.958
and I'm not letting
you kids get in my way!

19:28.041 --> 19:29.958
-Pugsley?

19:33.750 --> 19:35.791
<i>You love your family.</i>

19:35.875 --> 19:38.250
<i>You make sure they wear their seat belts.</i>

19:38.333 --> 19:41.625
I don't believe it.
After all these years of searching!

19:41.708 --> 19:44.375
Finally everyone can see the truth!

19:45.958 --> 19:49.083
<i>To the Spitburgh package</i>
<i>by Samsarah Mutual.</i>

19:49.166 --> 19:50.458
<i>Oh, it's the best,</i>

19:50.541 --> 19:53.833
<i>most expensive</i>
<i>life insurance option on the market.</i>

19:53.916 --> 19:56.083
<i>Sign up… </i>

20:32.750 --> 20:34.958
Hello, my darlings!

20:35.041 --> 20:37.250
Pauline?

20:37.333 --> 20:39.083
In the flesh.

20:39.166 --> 20:40.541
Well, kind of.

20:40.625 --> 20:42.000
Sore subject, actually.

20:42.083 --> 20:43.708
What is happening?

20:43.791 --> 20:47.375
So you finally show your true colors!

20:47.458 --> 20:50.250
Green is not my color,

20:50.333 --> 20:54.416
and I can't let anyone
see that unfortunate footage.

20:55.708 --> 20:58.000
I said don't touch it!

21:05.291 --> 21:08.958
Leave those kids alone!

21:09.041 --> 21:10.541
Outta my way!

21:12.000 --> 21:15.458
What a stunt! You still got it, Barb!

21:18.333 --> 21:19.916
Pugsley!

21:28.333 --> 21:31.708
Norma, uh, help!

21:31.791 --> 21:34.625
Hey, you all left me behind
to pay the restaurant tab.

21:34.708 --> 21:36.083
Courtney, not now!

21:37.416 --> 21:39.458
-Whoa, cool.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.083
What's so funny?

21:47.833 --> 21:49.750
You're too late!

21:50.666 --> 21:53.125
You. You were just buying time!

21:58.333 --> 22:00.833
Run!

22:15.166 --> 22:18.041
No, no!
