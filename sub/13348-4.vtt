WEBVTT

00:04.080 --> 00:08.244
I'm wishing on a star

00:10.510 --> 00:14.628
To follow where you are

00:17.050 --> 00:21.134
I'm wishing on a dream

00:23.850 --> 00:27.934
To follow what it means

00:30.650 --> 00:34.984
And I wish on all the rainbows

00:35.030 --> 00:37.362
That I see

00:37.410 --> 00:42.029
I wish on all the people who

00:42.080 --> 00:45.038
Really dream

00:50.760 --> 00:54.673
I'm wishing on a star

01:02.680 --> 01:05.934
- [Wendell] Oh Anthony, this
is the most terrible mess.

01:05.980 --> 01:08.471
Look at that,
"Wendell's Disgrace."

01:08.520 --> 01:11.853
They're cancelling my coronation
and all you're worried

01:11.900 --> 01:13.982
about is finding 5,000
Wendells to get your

01:14.030 --> 01:16.817
stupid mirror back!

01:16.860 --> 01:17.861
- How many have we
got all together?

01:17.910 --> 01:19.821
- Exactly 30 Gold Wendells.

01:21.950 --> 01:24.362
How are we gonna change
30 coins into 5,000

01:24.410 --> 01:27.789
by tomorrow morning?

01:27.830 --> 01:29.036
- Give them to me.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.330
Come on, come on, come on.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.871
Come on! I've got
an idea, come on.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.831
- [Wendell] I hope this is
going to get my coronation

01:34.880 --> 01:36.711
back on again.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.976
- Trust me, trust me.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.066
This is one of my best ideas.

01:55.110 --> 01:57.101
Oh, here here here.
This is the place.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.731
- [Wendell] May I remind
you that all your ideas

01:58.780 --> 02:01.112
haye so far resulted
In total failure?

02:01.160 --> 02:02.570
- All right, look.
Here here here.

02:02.620 --> 02:05.032
We've got 10 coins
apiece, all right?

02:05.080 --> 02:08.538
Now one of us has to win
a fortune by daybreak.

02:08.580 --> 02:09.820
Here, there there.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.030
- Thank you! And I made
something for Prince.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.955
- [Wendell] Oh no no,
tell her I refuse.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.627
It's so humiliating!

02:15.670 --> 02:16.876
- [Tony] He says he loves it.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.252
- [Virginia] Every
little bit helps.

02:20.590 --> 02:23.639
(ominous music)

02:26.390 --> 02:28.130
- We found him like
this five minutes ago.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.339
Now he won't come down.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.971
- Keep away from
me, or I'll jump!

02:32.020 --> 02:34.318
I'll just jump and
then you'll be sorry.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.988
Ha-ha! That'll spoil your plans.

02:37.030 --> 02:40.443
- Is there something you
wanted to get off your chest?

02:40.490 --> 02:42.196
- I refuse to be a man.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.776
I won't do it any longer.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.152
I insist on being a dog.

02:51.630 --> 02:55.703
- Well how can I stroke myself?

02:55.750 --> 02:57.047
- Ah.

02:57.090 --> 03:01.083
- How can I miss myself
like I miss my master?

03:01.140 --> 03:04.303
I demand to be a happy puppy!

03:04.350 --> 03:07.638
(barks)

03:07.680 --> 03:11.264
- Well, you've certainly
made your point.

03:11.310 --> 03:15.064
Now please, allow
me to make mine.

03:18.780 --> 03:22.568
(dramatic music)

03:26.490 --> 03:30.278
There are no masters here!

03:30.330 --> 03:33.993
And only one mistress.

03:34.040 --> 03:38.044
Don't forget that, doggy.

03:38.090 --> 03:41.127
I've booked you a riding lesson.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.138
- Oh, dear.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.557
(sobs)

03:49.180 --> 03:51.762
- Place your bets, please.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.941
- Excuse me, miss.

04:02.990 --> 04:04.901
What's the highest return
possible on one gold Wendell bet?

04:04.950 --> 04:07.987
- Well sir, you want to bet on
the Grand Jackrabbit Jackpot.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.109
10,000 to 1 odds.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.036
- Oh, yeah.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.241
- But it's only
ever been won once.

04:12.290 --> 04:14.952
- No! That's the game for me.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.832
- I'll raise you 20.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.179
- I sneer at your 20.

04:23.220 --> 04:25.085
Raise you 50!

04:25.140 --> 04:26.129
- Place your bets.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.966
- Place your bets.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.727
Wolf will win the jackpot and
then Virginia will love him

04:31.770 --> 04:33.260
even more!

04:34.650 --> 04:38.222
But if Wolf wins, then
Virginia gets the mirror...

04:38.270 --> 04:40.022
and then Virginia goes home!

04:40.070 --> 04:42.140
Oh, cripes!

04:44.200 --> 04:47.408
- 160. Bad luck, sir.

04:47.450 --> 04:50.157
- (sighs) Thank you.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.033
Tickety-boo, another.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.917
- Call it.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.623
- Have you got Mr.
Bun the Bakerman?

05:06.050 --> 05:08.507
(laughing)

05:08.550 --> 05:09.926
Read 'em and weep, oh poor baby!

05:09.970 --> 05:13.849
Look at my happy
families! (laughs)

05:16.560 --> 05:18.391
- Dogs don't like horses.

05:18.440 --> 05:22.069
- But Princes do. Up you get.

05:22.110 --> 05:25.147
Come on, up you get!

05:25.200 --> 05:26.519
There we go.

05:26.570 --> 05:29.027
That's it, nicely.
Take it easy now.

05:29.070 --> 05:30.446
Up you get!

05:32.120 --> 05:34.031
Off you go. There we are.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.900
There we are.

05:37.460 --> 05:41.453
The horse isn't going to move
unless you give him a command!

05:41.500 --> 05:43.548
Hit him.

05:46.130 --> 05:47.461
(horse nickers)

05:47.510 --> 05:48.795
(groans)

05:50.010 --> 05:51.216
Ta!
(horse neighs)

05:52.680 --> 05:54.136
- Help me!

05:54.180 --> 05:55.920
Somebody help me, please!

05:55.980 --> 05:57.845
(screaming)

05:57.900 --> 05:59.800
Stop horsey, slow down!

06:01.110 --> 06:04.648
- Your majesty, the
prince has escaped!

06:10.950 --> 06:13.828
- (sighs) It's gone wrong.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.571
It's all gone wrong.

06:20.210 --> 06:23.543
All my great plan.

06:26.090 --> 06:29.582
(whistling and bubbling)

06:41.110 --> 06:43.226
- [Mirror] Come to me.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.777
Come to me,

06:49.820 --> 06:53.119
and your mind will clear.

06:59.420 --> 07:02.958
(zapping)

07:35.580 --> 07:37.616
- Your majesty.

07:43.250 --> 07:46.083
I crave your guidance.

07:51.010 --> 07:54.082
The Troll King is
out of control.

07:54.140 --> 07:58.213
The dog is still missing
and the prince has escaped.

07:59.310 --> 08:02.552
Please, I need your help.

08:03.940 --> 08:06.317
- Kill the Troll King.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.066
- But how?

08:08.110 --> 08:10.237
He is so strong.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.238
He has an army to protect him.

08:16.700 --> 08:20.659
- How did I kill Snow White?

08:27.960 --> 08:32.078
The old ways are the best.

08:32.130 --> 08:34.712
(cackles)

08:42.020 --> 08:46.138
(horse galloping)

08:47.810 --> 08:49.016
(horse neighs)

08:49.070 --> 08:51.527
- [Dog] Whoa!

08:53.860 --> 08:55.441
- Mom! Mom!

08:57.990 --> 08:59.480
Mom, mom!

08:59.540 --> 09:00.279
- What is it?

09:00.330 --> 09:02.241
- Come and see, Mom.

09:02.290 --> 09:03.496
- See what?

09:03.540 --> 09:04.916
- There's a man.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.370
- What do you mean
there's a man?

09:08.460 --> 09:10.337
Fault of the forrest!

09:10.380 --> 09:12.450
It's his Royal Highness!

09:14.130 --> 09:17.429
(growling)

09:18.720 --> 09:21.883
- I've never seen anyone as
happy to lose as you, sir.

09:21.930 --> 09:24.592
- Well have you ever
been in love, miss?

09:24.640 --> 09:26.972
-_Just the once
Sir, to a knight.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.260
But he was married.

09:28.310 --> 09:30.562
- Too bad.

09:30.610 --> 09:32.566
(bell ringing)

09:32.610 --> 09:35.488
- Oh my goodness.

09:35.530 --> 09:38.272
You won the Jackrabbit Jackpot!

09:38.320 --> 09:39.526
- Oh no!

09:39.580 --> 09:41.070
- Congratulations, sir.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.826
10,000 gold coins.

09:42.870 --> 09:44.155
If you'd like to go
to the cash desk,

09:44.200 --> 09:45.110
you can pick up your winnings.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.037
- Stop pressuring me!

09:47.080 --> 09:50.038
- That's it, I've lost
everything. How are you doing?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.957
- I, well, you know.

09:53.010 --> 09:53.954
How are you doing?

09:54.010 --> 09:55.659
- I just said, I
lost everything!

09:55.720 --> 09:58.837
- Yeah, yeah. Right, me too.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.790
Let's get some fresh air.

10:02.140 --> 10:03.676
Lovely balcony this.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.019
Fre_sh air out here.
(Virginia groans)

10:07.060 --> 10:09.142
- I'm never gonna
be able to get home.

10:09.190 --> 10:12.728
I'm gonna be stuck here
for the rest of my life.

10:12.770 --> 10:16.103
I should feel terrible.

10:19.030 --> 10:21.828
Is it this place or...

10:21.870 --> 10:25.158
- Oh, Virginia I can't conceal
it from you any longer!

10:25.200 --> 10:26.827
Something has just
happened to me.

10:26.870 --> 10:27.495
- Me too.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.167
- Ijust...

10:29.210 --> 10:31.622
yes?

10:31.670 --> 10:34.833
- Tell me it's just this town.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.429
- Well, it is a magic love town.

10:38.470 --> 10:40.381
And flowers only grow
where there are seeds.

10:40.430 --> 10:42.386
Fireworks only
happen when there's

10:42.430 --> 10:43.556
stuff in the rockets already.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.137
- Maybe there is destiny.

10:46.180 --> 10:48.728
- There most certainly is.

10:48.770 --> 10:52.262
- Maybe I really am
supposed to be with you.

10:52.310 --> 10:56.019
- Oh, you most certainly are.

10:56.070 --> 11:01.064
(romantic music)

11:01.110 --> 11:03.829
- We should see how
dad's getting on.

11:08.870 --> 11:10.781
- Place your bets please.

11:10.830 --> 11:13.913
(Tony laughing)

11:13.960 --> 11:15.416
- And Mrs. Bone,
the Butcher's wife

11:15.460 --> 11:17.371
makes another complete set.

11:17.420 --> 11:18.580
- Well done, Dad.

11:18.630 --> 11:19.927
- Oh hey, yeah. I'm
up over 600 here.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.085
- Oh, 600?

11:21.130 --> 11:22.381
- Yeah but that's not enough.

11:22.430 --> 11:24.751
I mean, I'm not gonna break the
bank playing Happy Families.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.254
I've gotta get over to
the high roller table.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.516
- Yeah what are they
playing over there?

11:27.560 --> 11:29.096
- I don't know, I don't care.

11:29.140 --> 11:30.437
Well I mean, there's no card
game that scares me, all right?

11:30.480 --> 11:33.017
Do you remember, we spent
that week in Vegas in '93?

11:33.060 --> 11:35.358
- Oh yeah, when we
had to sell the car?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.106
- Uh no, it was the
year before that.

11:37.150 --> 11:39.141
Do me a favor, get me a bucket
for these chips over there.

11:39.190 --> 11:41.988
They're right over there.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.440
- Excuse me, sir.

11:43.490 --> 11:45.367
We're still waiting for you
to collect your winnings!

11:45.410 --> 11:47.822
- Shh! Shh! Yes, okay okay.

11:52.330 --> 11:54.286
- They say money doesn't
bring you happiness

11:54.330 --> 11:57.049
but it certainly brings
a smile to my face!

11:57.090 --> 11:59.718
- Oh, dear. I wish I
could say the same.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.087
- 10,000 Gold Wendells.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.005
Would you like to check it, sir?

12:05.050 --> 12:05.880
- No thanks, bye.

12:05.930 --> 12:07.090
- [Old man] Bravo!

12:07.140 --> 12:08.266
(Wolf groans)

12:08.310 --> 12:09.971
- Shh! Stop! Stop clapping.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.055
- [Evil Queen] Wolf.
(Wolf gasps)

12:11.100 --> 12:12.556
Speak to me.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.898
- She's back.

12:14.940 --> 12:17.727
- I know you're there.

12:17.770 --> 12:21.809
Why is it I can see you
and never your companions?

12:22.950 --> 12:24.861
Who is it that protects them?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.616
- I don't know nothing.

12:26.660 --> 12:29.902
- Has this girl got
you under her thumb?

12:29.950 --> 12:32.157
That's pathetic.

12:32.210 --> 12:35.498
If you killed her when I told
you, all this would be over.

12:35.540 --> 12:37.531
- Go away. Shoo!

12:37.590 --> 12:41.048
- This game is
nearly played out,

12:41.090 --> 12:44.378
and you are part of my plan.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.716
You always have been.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.000
- No. Don't.

12:48.050 --> 12:49.301
I'm not listening to you!

12:49.350 --> 12:51.261
Never!

12:51.310 --> 12:54.632
(old man humming)

13:01.150 --> 13:04.699
(ominous music)

13:04.740 --> 13:07.652
- I know your destiny.

13:07.700 --> 13:12.148
You ask a question and
I reveal its answer.

13:14.250 --> 13:17.572
- Who are you?

13:21.170 --> 13:23.502
- What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

13:23.550 --> 13:25.120
What am I gonna do?

13:25.180 --> 13:27.421
I'll give her the money, even
if it means I will lose her.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.040
It's the only
honorable thing to do.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.920
Yes! Then she could
go home safely

13:30.970 --> 13:32.517
and the Queen will
not get to her.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.675
Of course, you're gonna
have to kill yourself

13:33.730 --> 13:35.220
the moment she's gone.

13:35.270 --> 13:36.726
Your life won't be worth living!

13:36.770 --> 13:37.304
Won't it?

13:37.350 --> 13:39.432
Of course not.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.141
Wait a minute though,
she may be leaving

13:41.190 --> 13:43.181
but that's no reason
not to go for It aanay.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.310
Propose marriage!

13:45.360 --> 13:46.850
Give her enough money
to buy the mirror

13:46.910 --> 13:50.073
but spend the rest on presents
for a marriage proposal!

13:51.330 --> 13:53.571
Good idea. That is all fair.

13:53.620 --> 13:56.111
Then she has a
ch0Ice, home or me!

13:56.160 --> 13:56.990
Thanks!

13:57.040 --> 13:58.166
Don't mention it.

13:59.540 --> 14:03.419
(tense music)

14:20.770 --> 14:22.146
- Snap!

14:22.190 --> 14:23.680
Yeah.

14:24.570 --> 14:28.358
- The stake is increasing
to 500 gold Wendells a hand.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.980
- Too heavy for me.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.020
- Bye-bye now.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.947
Come back real soon when
you got more money, okay?

14:36.000 --> 14:36.955
(chuckles)

14:37.000 --> 14:39.286
(door knocking)

14:39.330 --> 14:41.161
- Is this the best
restaurant in town?

14:41.210 --> 14:42.950
- Do you know what
time it is? Go away.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.581
- No, I wish to
make a reservation.

14:44.630 --> 14:48.009
I need the entire restaurant,
it's for a marriage proposal.

14:48.050 --> 14:49.290
Oh!

14:50.720 --> 14:53.211
Now, you're gonna have to
start work immediately!

14:53.260 --> 14:55.888
The dishes I have in mind
will need obsessive attention!

14:55.930 --> 14:58.091
And a great deal of
marinading and preparing.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.938
Now, I want romantic food!

15:00.980 --> 15:02.857
Food that will sweep
her off her feet

15:02.900 --> 15:04.936
but also glue her to her seat.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.857
I want her to feel as if
she's had a meal that has

15:06.900 --> 15:08.231
changed her life!

15:08.280 --> 15:12.193
This must be the finest
meal ever cooked.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.731
- I am the greatest chef
in the nine kingdoms.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.692
Folks travel hundreds
of miles to eat my food.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.115
- Yeah well my date's
from a different dimension

15:19.160 --> 15:21.412
so don't slip up.

15:22.670 --> 15:23.955
- Wait a minute!

15:24.000 --> 15:26.457
There's 13 main courses!

15:27.800 --> 15:29.290
- Oh, not if you're
really hungry I guess.

15:29.340 --> 15:30.466
How many are the guests?

15:30.510 --> 15:31.829
- Just the two of us.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.788
- Two?

15:32.840 --> 15:34.717
I thought you were gonna say 20!

15:34.760 --> 15:38.594
This is far too much
food for two people!

15:38.640 --> 15:40.551
- Oh, you're right!

15:40.600 --> 15:42.181
Skip the soup.

15:42.230 --> 15:44.391
- I have found him.

15:48.940 --> 15:51.397
- Yes, I know the place.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.657
It's about 30 miles from here.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.151
Things are looking up.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.782
Now, give me the Troll King.

16:00.830 --> 16:03.788
- He will not speak to us.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.037
- Tell him his
children are dead.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.626
- Dead?

16:09.670 --> 16:10.910
Dead?

16:10.970 --> 16:14.462
- They are dead unless you
agree to meet me for talks.

16:14.510 --> 16:15.841
(Troll King grunts)

16:15.890 --> 16:17.926
- You evil pig!

16:17.970 --> 16:20.427
- Meet me at the Merry
Pips apple orchid.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.519
Come alone and unarmed or
I will slit their throats.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.070
- Snap!

16:43.120 --> 16:45.623
(laughs)

16:46.750 --> 16:49.082
- Still have tons and
tons of money left!

16:49.130 --> 16:51.086
I'll give the rest to
Virginia and then she can

16:51.130 --> 16:53.041
still buy the mirror!

16:53.090 --> 16:54.580
(gasps)

16:54.630 --> 16:57.463
Cripes! You fool!

16:57.510 --> 17:00.809
I almost forgot the
most important thing.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.095
Oh.

17:03.140 --> 17:04.971
Excuse me. I would
like to buy --

17:05.020 --> 17:06.726
- Just one moment please, sir.

17:06.770 --> 17:07.976
Morning duties.

17:08.020 --> 17:08.896
- Well I'm in a real
hurry, I need to buy --

17:08.940 --> 17:11.738
- If you please,
sir. Won't keep you.

17:11.780 --> 17:12.815
- Okay.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.560
Oh, I like that one.

17:15.610 --> 17:18.192
Oh! That's a nice one.

17:19.080 --> 17:23.289
(cuckoo clocks chiming)

17:32.460 --> 17:34.462
- Now sir, was
there something I --

17:34.510 --> 17:38.549
(cuckoo clock chiming)

17:41.220 --> 17:42.926
- [Wolf] I have money!

17:53.490 --> 17:55.560
(bird moaning)

17:55.610 --> 17:57.191
(gunshot)
(gasps)

18:01.280 --> 18:03.077
- Very good morning to you, sir.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.530
How may I serve you?

18:04.580 --> 18:08.209
- I need an engagement ring,
and not just any ordinary ring.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.083
- We don't sell_
ordinary rings, srr.

18:12.130 --> 18:13.757
- Oh.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.756
- Tell me a little
aboutthelady.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.041
Is she, um, a big girl?

18:18.090 --> 18:19.045
- No.

18:19.090 --> 18:20.671
Succulently slender.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.846
Lean.

18:21.890 --> 18:23.209
- Plain or pretty?

18:24.600 --> 18:27.057
- She's gorgeous. Are
you trying to insult me?

18:27.100 --> 18:28.727
- Almost assuredly not, sir.

18:28.770 --> 18:32.319
I am simply trying to
fit the ring to the lady.

18:32.360 --> 18:36.069
Some rings might
overwhelm a lady.

18:36.110 --> 18:38.396
- Well no ring is more
beautiful than my Virginia.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.157
- Oh, sir. How romantic.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.532
Sh_e sounds like a
girl In a million.

18:43.580 --> 18:44.285
- Ten million.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.866
100 million!

18:46.450 --> 18:49.954
- Then, I shouldn't insult
you by showing you these,

18:50.000 --> 18:53.083
everyday gold and
diamond engagement rings.

18:53.130 --> 18:55.041
- Good and diamond, heh.

18:55.090 --> 18:58.412
- Or even these,

18:58.470 --> 19:01.007
handmade by royal dwarfs.

19:01.050 --> 19:02.631
- Royal dwarfs.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.552
- Feast your eyes instead,

19:08.600 --> 19:10.841
on these.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.017
- [Rings] Choose me! Choose me!

19:17.990 --> 19:20.902
- I don't wish to be
indelicate sir, but these rings

19:20.950 --> 19:23.020
are disgracefully expensive.

19:23.070 --> 19:25.698
- Oh, well, money is no object.

19:25.740 --> 19:28.618
- You're my kind
of gentleman, sir.

19:28.660 --> 19:29.570
- Those were very nice!

19:29.620 --> 19:31.201
- Oh no no, sir.

19:32.580 --> 19:36.414
I have something unique

19:36.460 --> 19:38.792
in mind for you.

19:38.840 --> 19:42.799
(majestic music)

19:44.720 --> 19:46.881
- Oh.

19:53.020 --> 19:56.148
How I long to linger

19:56.190 --> 19:59.102
On your sweetheart's finger

19:59.150 --> 20:03.063
- It is a singing ring, sir.

20:03.110 --> 20:04.566
- Huff puff.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.986
A singing ring.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.155
I have to have it!

20:08.200 --> 20:10.327
- The lady who slips
this on her finger

20:10.370 --> 20:13.919
will have no choice,
she will simply say,

20:13.960 --> 20:15.587
III do!"

20:15.630 --> 20:17.086
- Are you sure?

20:17.130 --> 20:19.200
- No singing ring has
ever received a rejection.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.375
- Ever?

20:20.420 --> 20:23.969
- Comes with a lifetime
love guarantee.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.926
- I'll take it!

20:28.970 --> 20:32.883
- It's yours, for the sum
of 7,000 gold Wendells.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.931
- 7,000? Oh!

20:34.980 --> 20:36.049
7,000!

20:38.020 --> 20:40.022
- Is there a problem, sir?

20:40.070 --> 20:42.982
There are more modest rings
for less important ladies.

20:43.030 --> 20:45.237
- No! No no.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.907
I'll take it!

20:46.950 --> 20:50.693
- One more for the pot, dearie.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.826
- [Virginia] We've won
over 4,000 we can stop now.

20:54.870 --> 20:57.031
- Are we sure 4,000 will be
enough? It may not be enough.

20:57.090 --> 20:57.909
One more for the whole thing.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.871
- No no no no no!

20:59.920 --> 21:01.251
What are you doing?

21:01.300 --> 21:03.086
You have been playing all
night, you're too tired!

21:03.130 --> 21:05.678
- No no. One more for
the whole shebang.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.097
Listen, I can take her.

21:08.140 --> 21:10.927
I will laugh and chuckle

21:10.970 --> 21:12.767
On your girly's knuckle

21:12.810 --> 21:15.973
- Oh, this is going to be
the happiest day of my life!

21:16.020 --> 21:18.432
I will never fidget

21:18.480 --> 21:19.970
Jammed upon her digit

21:20.020 --> 21:21.146
- Shh, Shh, Shh.

21:21.190 --> 21:23.146
You'll spoil the
surprise! Be quiet!

21:23.190 --> 21:26.023
I'll be sweet and fresh

21:26.070 --> 21:28.197
Wrapped around her flesh

21:28.240 --> 21:30.822
- Wrapped around my (gasps)

21:30.870 --> 21:33.441
Oh, goodness! Oh dear. Oh dear.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.209
Oh, I hope Tony's done well.

21:38.670 --> 21:42.083
(tense music)

21:58.100 --> 21:59.931
- Where have you been?

21:59.980 --> 22:02.778
- I just popped out for a walk.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.059
How's he doing?

22:08.820 --> 22:10.321
- [Tony] Snap!

22:13.950 --> 22:18.068
- Sorry dearie,
better luck next time.

22:19.330 --> 22:22.879
Well, you certainly
have been lucky for me.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.969
So, a deal's a deal.

22:26.010 --> 22:27.500
I expect you want a biscuit,

22:27.550 --> 22:30.508
more than you want
this money though.

22:32.390 --> 22:33.926
- Prince!

22:33.970 --> 22:37.133
- [Wendell] Royal always
excel at gambling.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.430
What are you looking at?

22:38.480 --> 22:40.687
Ha_ven't we be better
gomg to the auction?

22:40.730 --> 22:42.391
- Oh, the auction! The auction!

22:42.440 --> 22:45.068
- And that brings
us to lot seven.

22:45.110 --> 22:48.773
A mystery mirror that has
been dated early Cinderellan

22:48.820 --> 22:51.118
with potential magic qualities.

22:51.160 --> 22:54.232
Who can start the bidding
for this extraordinary piece?

22:54.290 --> 22:55.689
100.

22:55.750 --> 22:56.785
200.

22:56.830 --> 22:57.740
- Emergency! Emergency!

22:57.790 --> 22:58.745
Coming through!

22:58.790 --> 22:59.916
Excuse us, excuse us.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.029
Sorry, sorry.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.036
Oh!

23:03.090 --> 23:04.239
VVhoa!

23:05.630 --> 23:07.166
- [Voiceover] Sliced
him for his money.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.835
- Move it along!

23:08.880 --> 23:11.383
Just a dead elf.

23:11.430 --> 23:15.423
Go home, the wings
ain't flapping anymore.

23:15.470 --> 23:20.339
- For the final time, I
am bid 3,800 gold pieces.

23:21.270 --> 23:23.977
Any advance?

23:24.020 --> 23:25.897
Going once.

23:25.940 --> 23:27.180
Going twice.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.856
- Wait, 5,000!

23:29.900 --> 23:31.060
- [Auctioneer] 5,000?

23:31.110 --> 23:32.407
- Yes.

23:32.450 --> 23:36.079
- Will anyone increase
on 5,000 gold Wendells?

23:36.120 --> 23:37.530
5,000.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.650
Going once.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.951
Going twice.

23:42.000 --> 23:42.989
- 10,000.

23:44.790 --> 23:45.950
- [Virginia] oh
my god, it's him!

23:46.000 --> 23:47.797
- [Tony] Oh god, how
did he get 10,000?

23:47.840 --> 23:51.799
- Any advance on 10,000?

23:54.050 --> 23:56.883
Sold to the gentleman
with the pipe.

23:56.930 --> 23:59.012
Your name, sir?

23:59.060 --> 24:01.472
- Mr. Hunter.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.806
I'll pay immediately.

24:06.110 --> 24:08.101
- He's got the elf's cane.

24:08.150 --> 24:10.983
That's how he got the
money, he killed the elf!

24:11.030 --> 24:12.520
- Well come on, we
can't just stand around!

24:12.570 --> 24:17.189
- That brings us to the next
item in the auction which is...

24:17.240 --> 24:20.038
- Only purchasers
allowed in here.

24:21.580 --> 24:24.242
- 22 carat gold,

24:24.290 --> 24:27.748
entitled Frozen Rage.

24:31.800 --> 24:35.338
(ominous music)

24:54.860 --> 24:57.021
- Why are we here so
early, your majesty?

24:57.070 --> 24:58.651
We're not meeting the
Queen for another hour.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.031
- Shut up!

25:00.080 --> 25:02.071
When she arrives she
must only see me unarmed

25:02.120 --> 25:03.701
or she will not advance,
do you understand?

25:03.750 --> 25:05.490
- Yes, your majesty.

25:14.180 --> 25:17.172
- There's no need to gnaw
on bones, your highness.

25:17.220 --> 25:20.383
We've got lovely
food in the larder.

25:20.430 --> 25:22.887
- Marrow bone. Mm.

25:25.190 --> 25:29.763
- Your highness might find
this a bit, presumptuous-like

25:29.820 --> 25:33.984
but could we say our siders
by royal appointment now?

25:38.450 --> 25:40.532
Oh my god!

25:40.580 --> 25:42.195
It's like a bedtime story!

25:42.250 --> 25:45.959
First of all we've got Prince
Charming, and now we've got --

25:46.000 --> 25:48.992
- Do be quiet, please.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.542
You seem like a nice family.

25:57.090 --> 25:59.638
What has the prince told you?

25:59.680 --> 26:02.717
- He's told us everything,
all about really being a dog

26:02.770 --> 26:04.977
and everything, it's amazing!

26:05.020 --> 26:07.841
- Oh dear.
(ominous music)

26:07.900 --> 26:10.937
That really was
the wrong answer.

26:34.010 --> 26:37.923
- I am alone, and unarmed.

26:37.970 --> 26:39.426
-As am I.

26:39.470 --> 26:42.177
- I have done what you've asked.

26:42.220 --> 26:44.268
Now where are my children?

26:44.310 --> 26:47.347
- To be quite honest,
I have no idea.

26:47.390 --> 26:51.599
I simply used them as an
excuse to get you to meet me.

26:51.650 --> 26:53.811
- Then I will kill you.

26:53.860 --> 26:57.023
- Don't you wish to know
my great plan first?

26:57.070 --> 26:59.948
- I have known of
your plan all along.

26:59.990 --> 27:02.902
To put the impostor
prince on the throne

27:02.950 --> 27:05.578
and rule the 4th
Kingdom yourself.

27:05.620 --> 27:09.033
- Do you think I spend
seven years rotting in jail

27:09.080 --> 27:11.913
just to rule one of
the nine kingdoms?

27:11.960 --> 27:14.201
I intend to have them all.

27:14.250 --> 27:16.798
- But where will I fit in?

27:16.840 --> 27:20.003
- Yes, I see what you mean.

27:20.050 --> 27:21.460
- I have heard enough!

27:23.180 --> 27:25.762
Trolls.

27:25.810 --> 27:26.959
Arise!

27:27.020 --> 27:30.558
(trolls grumble)

27:35.860 --> 27:38.897
You didn't expect that, did you?

27:38.940 --> 27:42.273
My men have been hiding
for the last hour.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.948
- I'm impressed
at your foresight

27:44.990 --> 27:47.322
and had you arrived
two hours earlier,

27:47.370 --> 27:49.656
you would have found me...

27:49.710 --> 27:52.918
(trolls groaning)

27:52.960 --> 27:55.497
poisoning the apples.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.842
Poison is something
of a science with me

28:04.890 --> 28:08.678
and I seemed to have
timed it just right.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.939
You know what they say, Relish.

28:11.980 --> 28:15.689
"An army marches
on its stomach."

28:15.730 --> 28:18.893
(dramatic music)

28:32.080 --> 28:35.459
(sighs)

28:36.670 --> 28:37.989
- Are you going to beat me?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.665
- No.

28:39.710 --> 28:41.792
I'm going to take you home.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.216
- Oh, excellent.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.801
Is this breakfast?

28:47.850 --> 28:50.887
- Not unless your
enjoy troll head.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.807
Drive on!

28:53.940 --> 28:56.056
(horses neigh)

28:59.440 --> 29:03.103
(gentle jazz music)

29:04.280 --> 29:06.737
- I don't understand
it, he just vanished!

29:06.780 --> 29:08.862
- [Wendell] And what is
your plan now, Anthony?

29:08.910 --> 29:10.400
- Get drunk.

29:10.450 --> 29:13.578
Barman, bottle of beer,
saucer of beer for my friend.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.872
- We only serve cocktails, sir.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.242
Cupid's first blush,
some enchanted evening,

29:19.300 --> 29:22.963
a long slow spell
against the wall.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.920
- Hello, boys!

29:27.340 --> 29:28.921
Has anyone seen Virginia?

29:28.970 --> 29:30.426
_- She'll be_down
in a few minutes.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.426
- A few minutes.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.845
- [Wendell] Anthony,
listen to me.

29:33.890 --> 29:35.596
On no_ condition
allow this wolf alone

29:35.640 --> 29:36.891
with your daughter tonight.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.430
- Why not?

29:38.480 --> 29:39.856
- [Wendell] You need to
ask? Think where you are.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.936
The love capital
of the kingdoms.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.699
She will come back
completely disheveled.

29:44.740 --> 29:46.401
- Boy, I'm ravenous!

29:46.450 --> 29:48.020
I've been fasting all day.

29:48.070 --> 29:50.527
_I could eat a
regiment of horses.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.820
- You know...

29:57.880 --> 29:59.836
I need to have a
few words with you.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.041
- About what, Ton'?

30:02.090 --> 30:05.162
- I think you know
what I'm worried about.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.211
- Is it your hair? I
know it's falling out!

30:07.260 --> 30:10.047
- Not my hair, my daughter!

30:10.100 --> 30:11.089
- Your daughter?

30:11.140 --> 30:13.927
- Yes, I need to know if your...

30:13.970 --> 30:16.973
intentions are honorable.

30:17.020 --> 30:20.808
(playful music)

30:24.860 --> 30:26.270
- No, not really.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.025
- No?

30:27.070 --> 30:28.196
- Well I can't deny it.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.696
I mean, they're
bordering, hovering,

30:29.740 --> 30:31.071
teetering on the dishonorable.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.987
- [Wendell] He'll have her on
her back before you can say,

30:34.040 --> 30:35.780
"Happy ever-after."

30:35.830 --> 30:37.149
- All right now you look here.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.576
Virginia is a very vulnerable
girl and she's a very --

30:39.630 --> 30:40.779
- (gasps) Virginia!

30:40.840 --> 30:43.456
Hi, you look so beautiful!

30:43.500 --> 30:44.876
Oh, are you ready?

30:44.920 --> 30:46.831
- You know, Wolf?

30:46.880 --> 30:48.836
I don't feel like going.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.928
- Oh, no! No!

30:50.970 --> 30:52.426
It's all planned!

30:52.470 --> 30:54.631
- It's just, I'm not hungry.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.011
- Oh, no!

30:56.060 --> 30:58.722
I've gone to a lot of
trouble creating this

30:58.770 --> 31:00.055
spontaneous evening.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.011
- Well...

31:02.060 --> 31:06.178
(romantic music)

31:07.900 --> 31:10.027
okay, we won't be long.

31:10.070 --> 31:11.731
- Oh, don't worry, Tony.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.828
Your daughter's
safe in my hands.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.282
- [Wendell] You're kissing
that girl's virginity goodbye,

31:17.330 --> 31:18.957
Anthony.

31:25.130 --> 31:26.620
- [Virginia] Wolf...

31:26.670 --> 31:29.047
(chuckles)

31:29.090 --> 31:31.081
Oh my god.

31:32.340 --> 31:34.922
You are the luckiest
man in the land

31:34.970 --> 31:37.882
Because you have a
singing ring in your hand

31:37.930 --> 31:38.840
- Shh shh shh.

31:38.890 --> 31:40.938
You'll spoil the surprise.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.390
- Who are you talking to?

31:42.440 --> 31:44.010
- Nobody.

31:44.060 --> 31:46.392
To the restaurant, driver!

31:46.440 --> 31:50.399
A_nd drive as
romantically as you can.

31:51.450 --> 31:53.406
(Virginia giggles)
(violin music)

31:53.450 --> 31:54.735
- Where's that
mu5ic coming from?

31:54.780 --> 31:56.281
- Do you like it?

31:56.330 --> 31:58.821
It's a tune, I had it
especially composed for you,

31:58.870 --> 32:01.577
it's called "A time
for commitment."

32:16.560 --> 32:21.133
- I had a perfectly
good business...

32:21.190 --> 32:25.354
I just expanded too soon.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.560
(sighs)

32:26.610 --> 32:28.566
Then the recession
hit me and well,

32:28.610 --> 32:30.430
I just lost everything.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.948
My business, my wife.

32:33.990 --> 32:36.322
My self-respect.

32:36.370 --> 32:38.190
(titters)

32:38.240 --> 32:39.821
Here's to Tony Lewis.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.953
Biggest failure in
all the 10 Kingdoms!

32:43.000 --> 32:46.788
- [Wendell] No Anthony, my failure
is much worse than yours.

32:46.840 --> 32:50.913
This has been a test of kinghood
and I have failed dismally.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.540
- Oh, come on.

32:52.590 --> 32:54.126
You know, it's not your fault
you got turned into a dog.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.216
That could happen to anybody!

32:56.260 --> 33:00.708
- [Wendell] Anthony, I'm
starting to forget things.

33:00.770 --> 33:05.594
Like my parents' names
and great big chunks

33:05.650 --> 33:08.357
of my life, it's (hics)

33:08.400 --> 33:13.190
it's like, it's like someone's
stealing my life from me.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.151
- [Bartender]
Message for you, sir.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.741
(ominous music)

33:21.790 --> 33:23.155
- [Tony] "Take the dog and
tie him to the post in the

33:23.210 --> 33:25.451
"centre of the town square.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.456
"If you have not done this
in 15 minutes, I will smash

33:27.500 --> 33:29.832
"the mirror into
100,000 pieces."

33:29.880 --> 33:32.542
Where did you get this from?

33:32.590 --> 33:34.421
- It was given to
the doorman, sir.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.006
- It's the huntsman!

33:36.050 --> 33:38.962
How did he know we were here?

33:39.010 --> 33:40.557
Where, what are we gonna do now?

33:40.600 --> 33:42.921
- Oh, without a doubt.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.971
You are the most quirky
girl in the whole

33:45.020 --> 33:46.976
of the Nine Kingdoms.

33:47.020 --> 33:49.932
- I bet you say that to
all your girlfriends.

33:49.980 --> 33:53.063
- You are my first girlfriend.

33:53.110 --> 33:54.896
- What?

33:54.950 --> 33:58.943
No, first as in, first ever?

33:58.990 --> 34:00.867
- Well, yes!

34:00.910 --> 34:04.118
A wolf mates for life.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.650
Am I not your first boyfriend?

34:05.710 --> 34:07.325
(Virginia giggles)

34:07.370 --> 34:11.204
No, god, I've been out
with loads of guys.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.081
- Oh.

34:13.130 --> 34:17.419
- Oh but, nothing serious.

34:19.640 --> 34:20.880
(romantic music)

34:20.930 --> 34:24.809
I have a hard time
trusting people.

34:27.850 --> 34:31.854
I just never wanna
jump unless...

34:31.900 --> 34:34.687
I'm sure somebody's
gonna catch me.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.106
- Oh, I'll catch you.

34:37.150 --> 34:39.311
And if I miss for any reason,
I'll sit by your bedside

34:39.360 --> 34:41.612
and nurse you back to health.

34:51.210 --> 34:54.873
(twinkling)

35:15.400 --> 35:17.061
- [Wolf] Cripes.
- [Virginia] Cripes.

35:19.610 --> 35:20.599
- You know what? No.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.117
I just can't let you do this.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.980
I mean, what if he puts an
arrow through both of us?

35:25.040 --> 35:28.908
We could be walking
right into a trap.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.832
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.916
The square.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.006
He's gonna wanna be able
to see me leaving you

35:40.050 --> 35:41.540
in the square.

35:41.590 --> 35:42.750
- [Wendell] So?

35:42.800 --> 35:44.927
- So he'd want a clear view.

35:44.970 --> 35:47.382
Which means he's probably
watching from somewhere --

35:47.430 --> 35:48.727
- [Wendell] Somewhere high!

35:48.770 --> 35:50.931
- [Tony] Yeah, somewhere
where he could...

35:50.980 --> 35:51.890
- [Wendell] That tower!

35:51.940 --> 35:53.225
- That's it. That's where he is.

35:53.270 --> 35:55.010
That's where the mirror
will be. Don't look up.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.970
Don't look up, just um...

35:57.030 --> 35:58.770
pretend to struggle, come on.

35:58.820 --> 36:01.607
(Wendell growling)

36:04.160 --> 36:06.617
- Oh my god!

36:09.710 --> 36:12.531
What an incredible evening.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.070
(chuckles) Thank you.

36:15.710 --> 36:16.995
Thank you.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.542
This is gonna cost
an absolute fortune!

36:20.590 --> 36:22.626
- I have a present for you.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.001
A very special present.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.142
- Oh!

36:34.190 --> 36:37.819
You_ar_e the luckiest
girl in the land

36:37.860 --> 36:42.445
'Cause we've got a
beautiful wedding planned

36:48.240 --> 36:51.038
- [Wendell] Just do a loose
knot, I'll be faster than him.

36:51.080 --> 36:51.819
- All right, where will you go?

36:51.870 --> 36:53.030
What if I don't see you again?

36:53.080 --> 36:53.956
- [Wendell] Oh, you will.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.570
- All right.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.780
Good luck, your majesty.

36:58.880 --> 37:02.418
(Wendell barking)

37:22.990 --> 37:25.402
- How have you paid
for all of this?

37:27.910 --> 37:29.229
- What?

37:29.280 --> 37:32.443
- How have you paid
for all of this?

37:32.500 --> 37:34.991
- Um...

37:35.040 --> 37:36.325
oh, yes!

37:36.380 --> 37:38.746
I won the Jackrabbit
Jackpot last night.

37:40.380 --> 37:42.587
- [Virginia] Last night?
- [Wolf] Mm-hm!

37:43.970 --> 37:46.507
- You said you lost
everything last night.

37:46.550 --> 37:47.710
- Did I?

37:47.760 --> 37:49.170
Um...

37:49.220 --> 37:51.962
Oh, well.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.169
I did win, some.

37:53.230 --> 37:55.050
- You said you lost everything!

37:55.100 --> 37:57.728
- I know but look
what I bought you.

37:57.770 --> 38:01.103
- Outside, when you were telling
me how much you loved me!

38:01.150 --> 38:02.390
You lied?

38:02.440 --> 38:06.024
What's happening
to me? I cannot see

38:39.810 --> 38:43.814
(tense music)

38:43.860 --> 38:45.020
- Oh, no!

38:48.990 --> 38:51.060
Wait! Hey!

38:51.120 --> 38:52.769
- How much did you win?

38:52.830 --> 38:53.785
- Um...

38:53.830 --> 38:54.990
(chuckles)

38:56.580 --> 38:58.821
I don't really remember!

38:58.870 --> 39:00.326
- How much?

39:00.380 --> 39:03.087
- I don't know, it
was around the, uh...

39:03.130 --> 39:05.200
around the 10,000 mark.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.160
- 10,000?

39:07.220 --> 39:08.790
10,000?

39:08.840 --> 39:10.637
We could have gotten
the mirror back

39:10.680 --> 39:12.386
and you spend it on food?

39:12.430 --> 39:14.000
- No, I didn't spend it on food!

39:14.060 --> 39:15.425
I spent it on you!

39:15.470 --> 39:17.051
- We could have gone home!

39:17.100 --> 39:19.432
We could have gone home,
don't you understand?

39:19.480 --> 39:21.471
I don't belong here!

39:21.520 --> 39:22.896
I wanna go home!

39:22.940 --> 39:24.259
- No, you don't wanna go home!

39:24.320 --> 39:25.935
I have lots of things planned!

39:25.980 --> 39:27.891
I have, there's a
gondola out back

39:27.940 --> 39:30.158
and there's fireworks
and more ﬁzzy stuff!

39:30.200 --> 39:32.907
- You don't care about me,
you just care about yourself!

39:32.950 --> 39:34.827
- No no no, that's not true!

39:34.870 --> 39:36.940
- I never wanna see you again!

39:37.000 --> 39:40.743
- No Virginia, please don't go!

39:40.790 --> 39:42.872
Virginia!

39:42.920 --> 39:47.004
(harrowing music)

39:50.970 --> 39:54.462
(ominous music)

40:06.320 --> 40:08.777
- [Voiceover] The
Prince! He's back!

40:08.820 --> 40:11.857
(crowd cheering)

40:14.530 --> 40:17.613
- The return of the
Prince. Happy ever-after.

40:17.660 --> 40:20.959
Get your souvenir copy
of the Kingdom Times.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.832
(Wolf sobbing)

40:24.880 --> 40:26.871
- Why was I ever
stupid enough to think

40:26.920 --> 40:30.003
that a girl like her would
fall for an animal like me?

40:31.090 --> 40:32.500
Where's she gone

40:32.550 --> 40:34.336
It's all gone wrong

40:35.890 --> 40:40.008
(Wolf howls)

41:23.020 --> 41:24.089
- Here he comes!

41:24.140 --> 41:25.767
Here he comes!

41:25.810 --> 41:28.563
Here he comes!
(crowd cheering)

41:36.990 --> 41:39.868
- Prince Wendell!

41:39.910 --> 41:43.494
(crowd cheering)

41:50.000 --> 41:51.911
- [Wendell] This can't be!

41:51.960 --> 41:52.949
That's a lie!

41:53.010 --> 41:55.547
I'm Prince Wendell!

41:58.850 --> 42:01.637
- Gentlemen!

42:01.680 --> 42:03.807
The crisis is over!

42:03.850 --> 42:05.761
The kingdom is safe again!

42:05.810 --> 42:07.892
- Oh!

42:07.940 --> 42:09.350
- He's coming home!

42:09.400 --> 42:11.971
The coronation's back on!

42:40.010 --> 42:41.966
You cannot win her

42:42.010 --> 42:45.059
You cannot choose her

42:45.100 --> 42:48.342
You are just a
hopeless loser

42:52.020 --> 42:54.318
(ring whelps)

43:01.070 --> 43:03.732
(ring whelps and screams)

43:06.790 --> 43:11.454
- Now you see what I
told you all along.

43:11.500 --> 43:15.869
You are nothing, without me.

43:15.920 --> 43:19.708
Will you come back to me?

43:19.760 --> 43:23.093
Will you turn back to me now?

43:25.020 --> 43:27.921
(Wolf whimpering)

43:29.140 --> 43:30.391
- Yes.

43:32.020 --> 43:35.524
(harrowing music)

44:19.240 --> 44:22.107
- Well at least things
can't get any worse.

44:39.630 --> 44:41.871
You idiot!

44:41.930 --> 44:44.216
This mirror was
our only way home!

44:44.260 --> 44:45.670
- I can...

44:46.550 --> 44:48.711
- [Wendell] Uh, Anthony?
- [Tony] Not now.

44:48.770 --> 44:52.228
- [Wendell] I don't think
she's very pleased with you.

44:52.270 --> 44:54.306
Maybe you shouldn't have
been up on the roof.

44:54.350 --> 44:56.306
Oh, it feels like
everything is going away.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.600
- It's your imagination.

44:57.650 --> 44:59.561
Would you be careful not
to cut yourself, please?

44:59.610 --> 45:01.601
- Look! The mirror breaker!

45:01.650 --> 45:02.730
- There he is!

45:02.780 --> 45:04.099
Mirror breaker!

45:04.160 --> 45:08.073
- He's broken a magic mirror,
that's seven years bad luck!

45:08.120 --> 45:09.610
- What? Oh, come on people.

45:09.660 --> 45:12.367
_You don't _believe that
Silly superstition, do you?

45:20.420 --> 45:24.959
Now you see? What you don't
believe in can't hurt you.

45:25.010 --> 45:26.329
(whistling)

45:26.390 --> 45:27.095
(thud)

45:27.140 --> 45:28.880
Ow!

45:28.930 --> 45:30.557
Ow ow ow!

45:30.600 --> 45:32.977
Look at the size of
this rock, it just...

45:33.020 --> 45:34.260
what are the chances of that?

45:34.310 --> 45:36.471
- Mirror breaker,
get out of town!

45:36.520 --> 45:38.101
We don't want your
bad luck here!

45:38.150 --> 45:39.720
- Get out of town!

45:39.770 --> 45:41.988
(crowd murmuring)

45:42.030 --> 45:44.772
- All right. All
right, all right.

45:50.950 --> 45:54.408
(ominous music)

45:58.880 --> 46:02.543
(thunder rumbling)

46:02.590 --> 46:05.002
This is no good.

46:05.050 --> 46:06.881
We need the frame, there
are too many pieces missing.

46:06.930 --> 46:08.841
We've gotta go back!

46:10.310 --> 46:12.016
- What's on the back?

46:12.060 --> 46:13.175
- Wait a minute, don't.

46:13.220 --> 46:14.676
Whoa whoa, don't
mess up the pieces.

46:14.730 --> 46:16.800
It took us hours to put
these pieces together.

46:16.850 --> 46:18.431
What are you doing?

46:19.480 --> 46:20.856
- [Virginia] Look.

46:22.110 --> 46:23.930
- Well maybe it some kind
of secret clue, all right?

46:23.990 --> 46:25.480
Look, look.

46:25.530 --> 46:29.944
Man read by the
war of Rag Mount.

46:29.990 --> 46:32.231
It's maybe about a battle.

46:32.290 --> 46:35.782
- No, it's not a clue
it's a maker's seal.

46:35.830 --> 46:37.070
Man...

46:37.120 --> 46:39.076
here, see, "Manufactured"

46:39.130 --> 46:43.373
That's it, "Manufactured
by the war..."

46:43.420 --> 46:45.718
- [Tony] Of um, Rag Mount...

46:45.760 --> 46:47.546
Mounty? Mounties?

46:47.590 --> 46:50.923
- No no, that's an N. Mountain.

46:50.970 --> 46:53.552
"Manufactured by the war of..."

46:53.600 --> 46:56.057
- Uh it looks like
that's a D, Drago.

46:56.100 --> 46:59.433
- No, it's more of a
gap than that. Dragon.

46:59.480 --> 47:04.270
"Manufactured by the
Dwarves of Dragon Mountain."

47:04.320 --> 47:06.811
- [Wendell] Oh dear,
Dragon Mountain.

47:06.860 --> 47:08.441
- Prince, you know
where that is?

47:08.490 --> 47:10.060
- [Wendell] Well yes, but I --

47:10.110 --> 47:11.020
- He knows where it is.

47:11.070 --> 47:11.946
- Let's go!

47:11.990 --> 47:13.230
- Before any bad luck happens.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.110
- [Wendell] Well you
should know that it's

47:14.160 --> 47:15.400
a very long way from here.

47:15.450 --> 47:16.997
- You know what, too?

47:17.040 --> 47:18.450
We should go to that farm
house to try to get some food

47:18.500 --> 47:19.990
before we go.

47:21.290 --> 47:24.088
(bubeng)

47:28.720 --> 47:31.632
- That's not gold.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.090
- It is.

47:33.140 --> 47:34.926
- It's fool's gold.

47:34.970 --> 47:36.972
- I got it at a knockdown
price on account of it

47:37.020 --> 47:40.558
being the ugliest
thing you've ever seen.

47:42.940 --> 47:47.775
(crumbling)
(muffled whelping)

47:49.900 --> 47:52.983
Where is that noise coming from?

47:53.030 --> 47:53.940
- Ah!

47:56.040 --> 48:00.409
(trolls grumbling
over each other)

48:12.970 --> 48:13.846
- I don't think anybody's here.

48:13.890 --> 48:15.926
- No, I heard something.

48:16.890 --> 48:18.846
- Why don't we
check around back?

48:18.890 --> 48:19.845
Oh no wait, somebody --

48:19.890 --> 48:20.800
(dramatic music)
(gasps)

48:20.850 --> 48:22.556
Oh my god, they're back!

48:24.020 --> 48:25.851
- Kill them!

48:30.700 --> 48:31.815
- Go, go!

48:34.570 --> 48:38.279
(trolls groaning)

48:41.790 --> 48:46.124
(triumphant music)

48:57.930 --> 49:00.478
- Welcome back, your majesty!

49:00.520 --> 49:02.181
And congratulations.

49:02.230 --> 49:05.688
We've been worried sick.

49:05.730 --> 49:07.891
- Thank goodness
you are back, sir.

49:09.230 --> 49:12.063
There's so much
organizmg to be done.

49:12.110 --> 49:15.944
Lord Rupert has gone to
collect your coronation gifts.

49:17.490 --> 49:20.789
I don't recognize the footman,
sir. A new member of staff?

49:20.830 --> 49:23.321
- I wish to go
straight to my room.

49:23.370 --> 49:24.860
- Of course, your majesty.

49:24.920 --> 49:27.662
You must be exhausted
after your long journey!

49:27.710 --> 49:29.746
- No, I need to urinate.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.789
I must go straight away!

49:30.840 --> 49:33.161
Otherwise it's a leg-lifter.

49:33.220 --> 49:35.882
- Of course, can I have
something sent up to your room?

49:35.930 --> 49:37.249
- Um...

49:37.300 --> 49:38.881
yes!

49:38.930 --> 49:41.262
What do I usually have?

49:41.310 --> 49:43.175
- Cocoa and a cheese
sandWIch, Sir.

49:43.230 --> 49:44.595
-Do I?

49:44.640 --> 49:48.974
- It's your favorite,
your majesty!

49:49.020 --> 49:51.227
- Then I'll have it, and um...

49:51.280 --> 49:54.602
send up a tray of
juicy bones as well.

49:56.740 --> 50:00.619
(ominous music)

50:10.170 --> 50:11.876
- Away!

50:11.920 --> 50:14.002
We will tend to the horses.

50:35.740 --> 50:38.311
- [Wendell] I came to
Dragon Mountain once before.

50:38.360 --> 50:42.319
When I was a young pup,
I mean, a young prince.

50:42.370 --> 50:46.204
The entrance to the Dwarf Kingdom
is somewhere up very high.

50:46.250 --> 50:48.741
It's a very long throwaway
but I can't really

50:48.790 --> 50:51.281
remember where, in fact,

50:51.340 --> 50:54.002
I don't seem to remember
anything at all these days.

50:54.050 --> 50:57.963
I'm going more and
more, well, doggy.

50:58.890 --> 51:00.710
- Ew, ugly looking dragon.

51:00.760 --> 51:03.718
- What is a questing permit?

51:03.770 --> 51:06.307
- Well there's nothing here.

51:06.350 --> 51:07.977
- Well, it must be up
the mountain some more.

51:08.020 --> 51:10.011
Come on!

51:10.060 --> 51:12.187
- [Wendell] I wish I could
remember if the dragons

51:12.230 --> 51:14.027
are still alive.

51:25.500 --> 51:26.364
(clanging)

51:26.410 --> 51:28.651
- Oh no, wait a minute! No no!

51:31.790 --> 51:33.496
No no no no!

51:33.540 --> 51:37.715
(whistling)

51:41.680 --> 51:43.170
- Anything important inside?

51:43.220 --> 51:44.801
- Did you see that?

51:44.850 --> 51:47.011
Both of those straps broke
exactly at the same time!

51:47.060 --> 51:49.881
What are the odds of that?
Like a billion to one!

51:49.940 --> 51:52.431
- Yeah, or maybe you just
didn't tie it properly.

51:52.480 --> 51:54.061
- No, I tied it properly.

51:54.110 --> 51:55.566
It's my bad luck.

51:55.610 --> 51:56.895
- (chuckles) Yeah.

51:56.940 --> 51:58.180
Hey, I got the greatest
luck of all getting to

51:58.240 --> 52:00.697
travel with you!

52:03.990 --> 52:06.197
- You know...

52:06.240 --> 52:09.289
if you've got something
to say, just say it.

52:09.330 --> 52:11.241
Get it off your chest, anything's
better than this sulking.

52:11.290 --> 52:13.281
- I'm not sulking!

52:13.330 --> 52:15.742
- Young woman...

52:15.800 --> 52:17.199
- I'm just wondering what
you were doing on the roof

52:17.260 --> 52:18.454
of that building!

52:18.510 --> 52:19.829
How could you?

52:19.880 --> 52:22.007
With the mirror, our only hope!

52:22.050 --> 52:23.881
- Are you still on about
the mirror? It's gone!

52:23.930 --> 52:25.966
I said I'm sorry but it's done!

52:26.010 --> 52:28.217
- You know, I spend my whole
life looking after you.

52:28.270 --> 52:30.135
You're alone for five minutes
and look what happens!

52:30.180 --> 52:31.056
- Excuse me, looking after me?

52:31.100 --> 52:32.806
Who raised you for 20 years?

52:32.850 --> 52:34.511
I had to work six days a week,
do you ever think of that?

52:34.560 --> 52:36.107
No. Just Virginia.

52:36.150 --> 52:37.606
Me me me me me!

52:37.650 --> 52:39.561
- Oh, I really
hate you sometimes.

52:39.610 --> 52:41.441
- Well you know what?
If it helps, go ahead.

52:41.490 --> 52:43.697
Have a nice long
hate, I'm used to it.

52:43.740 --> 52:45.150
- Okay.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.865
- This is a lot better than
the other place, I'll tell you

52:52.920 --> 52:54.239
that for nothing.

52:57.920 --> 53:01.048
Nobody helped me,
I did it myself.

53:01.090 --> 53:03.467
Well?

53:03.510 --> 53:05.330
- [Troll] Hello?

53:05.390 --> 53:06.596
(thumping)

53:06.640 --> 53:07.709
Hello?

53:07.760 --> 53:10.172
Anyone there?

53:13.940 --> 53:17.148
Hey, come here, it's the Queen!

53:20.900 --> 53:23.903
Hey, your majesty, we're back!

53:23.950 --> 53:25.941
- Alive and kicking!

53:25.990 --> 53:27.196
- And madder than ever!

53:27.240 --> 53:30.232
- I must say, I am most
surprised to see you.

53:30.290 --> 53:33.532
- Your majesty, could you
use one of your mirrors

53:33.580 --> 53:35.320
to contact our dad?

53:35.370 --> 53:37.782
- [Troll] Yeah, he'll be
very worried about us.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.836
- You haven't heard
the awful news then?

53:41.880 --> 53:43.120
- We haven't heard anything.

53:43.170 --> 53:44.751
We've been gold.

53:46.140 --> 53:48.961
- Your father has been murdered.

53:52.850 --> 53:54.010
- Who?

53:54.060 --> 53:55.891
Who did this?

53:55.940 --> 53:59.353
- The girl, she poisoned him.

53:59.400 --> 54:02.187
Swear that you will
track her down!

54:03.740 --> 54:05.901
- [Trolls] We swear it!

54:19.630 --> 54:20.699
- Whoa whoa, where
are you going?

54:20.750 --> 54:22.047
This is the path.

54:22.090 --> 54:24.718
- No, that goes down.
Sloping downwards?

54:24.760 --> 54:25.966
This is the way up.

54:26.010 --> 54:27.671
- That's not even a path,
that's like for goats.

54:27.720 --> 54:29.210
It goes back up around
the hill I'm sure,

54:29.260 --> 54:30.090
right around the corner.

54:30.140 --> 54:32.176
- Prince, am I right?

54:32.220 --> 54:35.599
- [Wendell] Anthony, I know
this is highly irregular

54:35.640 --> 54:39.974
but would you mind giving
me a cuddle, please?

54:40.020 --> 54:41.851
- You see, I'm right.
This is the way!

54:41.900 --> 54:45.063
- Fine. You go your
way, I'll go mine.

54:45.110 --> 54:46.441
- Well all right, fine, go!

54:46.490 --> 54:49.732
Don't blame me when
the dragons get you!

54:49.780 --> 54:51.111
I'm not going that way!

54:51.160 --> 54:53.902
- [Virginia] Okay!
' [Tony] Because it's wrong!

54:53.950 --> 54:55.247
(sighs)

54:56.750 --> 54:59.913
- [Wendell] Oh, no. Decisions.

55:01.960 --> 55:03.746
(Wendell barks)

55:03.800 --> 55:05.870
- You coming with me?

55:05.920 --> 55:08.081
You know this is
right, don't you?

55:08.130 --> 55:11.793
(ominous music)

55:26.820 --> 55:28.390
How could she defy me like that?

55:28.450 --> 55:29.849
So obstinate.

55:29.910 --> 55:30.865
Well you came with me
because you know I was going

55:30.910 --> 55:32.275
in the right direction, right?

55:32.330 --> 55:34.946
- [Wendell] Uh, no.
- [Tony] No?

55:34.990 --> 55:37.242
I only came with you because
Virginia doesn't understand

55:37.290 --> 55:38.826
anything I say.

55:42.670 --> 55:45.127
- She doesn't
understand me either.

55:49.470 --> 55:53.008
(Virginia groaning)

55:53.050 --> 55:55.678
- The one time he
had to be right.

55:58.810 --> 56:00.846
(wasps buzzing)

56:02.560 --> 56:06.644
- Since when do wasps build
nests halfway up a mountain?

56:06.690 --> 56:08.601
Of all the places I
could put my hand.

56:08.650 --> 56:11.232
Just, it's beyond
belief, I'm telling you!

56:11.280 --> 56:15.319
- [Wendell] Tony, I'm
scared. I'm losing my mind.

56:15.370 --> 56:16.689
- No. You're not, all right?

56:16.740 --> 56:18.822
Just, give that a rest, please?

56:18.870 --> 56:20.826
- [Wendell] No, I am. Please.

56:20.870 --> 56:22.030
You promised me a cuddle.

56:22.080 --> 56:25.664
Yes. Combined cuddle
and stroke, please.

56:27.590 --> 56:29.501
That's nice.

56:31.880 --> 56:34.633
(Virginia panting)

56:35.930 --> 56:37.670
Oh no, Tony. It's happening.

56:37.720 --> 56:39.017
I'm going dog.

56:39.060 --> 56:42.598
I'm going dog and
there's no going back.

56:42.650 --> 56:44.106
Oh...

56:44.150 --> 56:46.687
I'm so tired.

56:46.730 --> 56:50.109
Always so, tried.

56:50.150 --> 56:51.890
Sleepies.

56:51.950 --> 56:53.941
- Wish I was a dog.

56:53.990 --> 56:56.481
Someone to take
care of me, feed me.

56:56.530 --> 56:59.863
So I wouldn't have to
worry about anything.

57:01.460 --> 57:03.610
That would be heaven.

57:03.670 --> 57:05.831
(rocks crumbling)

57:05.880 --> 57:06.949
Ah.

57:08.750 --> 57:10.877
- Oh, hi.

57:11.840 --> 57:12.795
So you made it.

57:12.840 --> 57:14.501
- Yeah.

57:14.550 --> 57:16.882
We've been here quite a while.

57:16.930 --> 57:17.806
- Really?

57:17.850 --> 57:20.171
- Mm-hm. About an hour.

57:20.220 --> 57:23.883
- Oh, I didn't
know it was a race.

57:23.940 --> 57:26.852
- [Tony] Oh, I didn't
know that was a path.

57:42.750 --> 57:45.822
- There's more paw prints here.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.531
They came this way!

57:49.380 --> 57:52.292
- Da, da, dad's...

57:52.340 --> 57:54.831
d-d-dead!

57:56.970 --> 58:00.929
- Well, look on the bright side.

58:00.970 --> 58:03.268
No more beatings!

58:03.310 --> 58:04.686
- Oh!

58:04.730 --> 58:07.893
We can fail totally
without fear of punishment!

58:07.940 --> 58:09.259
- Yeah! Haha.

58:09.320 --> 58:11.276
- (grumbles) Old bastard!

58:11.320 --> 58:12.776
(laughing)

58:12.820 --> 58:13.980
- Yeah, he can suck an Elf.

58:14.030 --> 58:15.236
(trolls laughing)

58:15.280 --> 58:17.407
- Wait! Wait!

58:17.450 --> 58:19.862
What are we saying?

58:19.910 --> 58:23.448
He was our dad!

58:24.410 --> 58:27.322
He took us hunting.

58:27.370 --> 58:31.545
- He, he gave us
our first weapons.

58:31.590 --> 58:35.708
- He taught us how to keep
a torture victim conscious!

58:35.760 --> 58:37.921
For hours!

58:37.970 --> 58:41.258
(trolls sob)

58:41.310 --> 58:45.098
- Oh, wait until we get a
hold of that little witch!

58:45.140 --> 58:46.937
We'll tear her head off!

58:46.980 --> 58:48.299
- Yeah!

58:48.350 --> 58:50.011
(trolls shouting)

58:51.400 --> 58:53.891
(Tony and Virginia panting)

58:53.940 --> 58:55.521
- [Tony] I think you're
sitting on somebody.

58:55.570 --> 58:56.059
- What?

58:56.110 --> 58:56.986
Ew!

58:59.110 --> 59:02.989
- "Here lies Ivan the Optimist."

59:03.040 --> 59:04.496
- Do you think these
people found the dragon

59:04.540 --> 59:06.280
or the dragon found them?

59:06.330 --> 59:07.866
- Well these graves look really
old, I don't think any more

59:07.920 --> 59:09.535
dragons are...

59:09.580 --> 59:12.879
- God, this is insane.

59:12.920 --> 59:15.502
We must have climbed
about 1,000 feet.

59:15.550 --> 59:17.962
- We should think about
staying here tonight.

59:18.010 --> 59:20.638
- What, in a graveyard?

59:20.680 --> 59:23.217
Wait a minute, really?

59:23.260 --> 59:25.216
Are you crazy?

59:25.270 --> 59:28.933
(howling wind)

59:30.440 --> 59:34.729
(melancholic music)

59:34.780 --> 59:36.850
- Oh, this was such
a bad idea of mine

59:36.900 --> 59:38.697
to come all the way up here.

59:38.740 --> 59:40.856
I am so sorry.

59:43.870 --> 59:48.034
(wolf howling)

59:50.830 --> 59:53.708
You miss that wolf, don't you?

59:53.750 --> 59:55.126
(Virginia titters)

59:59.380 --> 1:00:01.007
Well I'll tell you one thing,
I think this might be the end

1:00:01.050 --> 1:00:02.847
for me because I don't think
I'm gonna be able to stand

1:00:02.890 --> 1:00:04.801
seven years of bad luck.

1:00:09.810 --> 1:00:11.596
I want you to know
something though.

1:00:11.650 --> 1:00:13.390
I'm really proud of you.

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:16.227
I mean, without you we
wouldn't have gotten this far.

1:00:20.490 --> 1:00:21.980
- I'm cold, give me a hug.

1:00:22.030 --> 1:00:24.237
- Oh, come here.
(Virginia chuckles)

1:00:56.110 --> 1:00:59.318
(Wendell whimpering)

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:01.942
- [Wendell] Big bone.

1:01:01.990 --> 1:01:03.810
Big bone.

1:01:05.620 --> 1:01:07.269
- Prince!

1:01:07.330 --> 1:01:09.616
(chuckles) Where did
you get that, boy?

1:01:09.660 --> 1:01:12.367
- [Wendell] Big bone. Big bone.

1:01:12.410 --> 1:01:13.707
- Yeah, big bone, big bone.

1:01:13.750 --> 1:01:15.786
Yes, biggest bone I've
ever seen in my life.

1:01:15.830 --> 1:01:16.910
Where'd you get it from?

1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:17.745
(Wendell barks)

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:19.540
- [Wendell] Follow me.

1:01:19.590 --> 1:01:22.127
(ominous music)

1:01:22.170 --> 1:01:24.502
(Wendell barks)

1:01:27.220 --> 1:01:29.711
- [Tony] Well, we
found the dragon.

1:01:29.770 --> 1:01:32.056
- [Virginia] He's not
breathing any ﬁre.

1:01:32.100 --> 1:01:33.306
- [Tony] No, but look.

1:01:33.350 --> 1:01:34.806
Look, it's guarding something.

1:01:34.850 --> 1:01:36.932
It's an entrance!

1:01:39.690 --> 1:01:40.896
Pnnce!

1:01:40.940 --> 1:01:42.180
(grumbles)

1:01:52.750 --> 1:01:54.661
(bones rattling)

1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:08.880
Oh!

1:02:08.930 --> 1:02:09.919
- [Virginia] "Dwarf Mines."

1:02:09.970 --> 1:02:12.177
- This must be where
they make the mirrors.

1:02:15.890 --> 1:02:17.096
Whoa.

1:02:17.150 --> 1:02:18.936
Can't even see the bottom,
I can't go down there.

1:02:18.980 --> 1:02:20.857
Not with my luck.

1:02:20.900 --> 1:02:21.810
- I think it's the only way.

1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:23.600
- Whoa whoa, no no.
I don't think so!

1:02:23.650 --> 1:02:26.699
- Oh come on, just
get on behind me.

1:02:26.740 --> 1:02:29.618
Look, if Dwarves can
do it, it must be safe!

1:02:29.660 --> 1:02:30.365
Come on, Prince.

1:02:30.410 --> 1:02:31.695
- How does that follow?

1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:35.826
You know, Virginia, it might
not even be a slide at all.

1:02:35.870 --> 1:02:39.328
It could be a
dragon-feeding trough.

1:02:40.630 --> 1:02:44.589
(Wendell screaming)

1:02:46.300 --> 1:02:48.541
- [Wendell] Oh, dear.

1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:53.052
- Come on, Dad, you can do it.

1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:57.181
(clanging)

1:02:58.770 --> 1:02:59.896
See, you made it.

1:02:59.940 --> 1:03:01.350
Good job.

1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:02.776
- Great.

1:03:04.860 --> 1:03:08.569
(clanging)
(dwarves shouting)

1:03:27.420 --> 1:03:30.583
- Attention! Attention!

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:34.804
Comrades! This is a great day.

1:03:34.850 --> 1:03:37.887
The time has come to, behold!

1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:41.853
The birth of the mirror!

1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:46.147
No one has made a truth mirror

1:03:46.190 --> 1:03:49.353
for over 500 years!

1:03:57.870 --> 1:04:00.111
(explosion)

1:04:00.170 --> 1:04:03.458
Behold, Prince Wendell's
coronation gift!

1:04:03.500 --> 1:04:05.877
(dwarves cheering)

1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:08.718
- See that, Prince?
That's for you.

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:13.887
(clang)
- Ow! Ow!

1:04:13.930 --> 1:04:15.591
Ow ow!

1:04:22.980 --> 1:04:25.642
- Do you realize the penalty
for entering our secret mines,

1:04:25.690 --> 1:04:27.601
comrades?

1:04:27.650 --> 1:04:29.231
- Is it a heaw fine?

1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:30.816
- It is death.

1:04:30.860 --> 1:04:32.657
This is our mountain.

1:04:32.700 --> 1:04:33.735
- You know what?
And you can have it.

1:04:33.780 --> 1:04:35.327
We're just trying to get
back to the 4th Kingdom.

1:04:35.370 --> 1:04:37.907
- Yeah we didn't even
know we were trespassmg.

1:04:37.950 --> 1:04:39.998
- Ignorance is no excuse.

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:42.782
You have illegally entered
the underground 9th Kingdom,

1:04:42.830 --> 1:04:46.288
and anyone who tries to
steal our secrets, will die.

1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:48.752
- Secrets? No no no. You
can keep your secrets.

1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:50.290
We actually need your help.

1:04:50.340 --> 1:04:51.580
- Right. Right.

1:04:51.630 --> 1:04:53.837
You see, there was a
magic mirror recently.

1:04:53.890 --> 1:04:54.845
Well, I had a little accident.

1:04:54.890 --> 1:04:56.039
- You?

1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:57.840
It was you?

1:04:57.890 --> 1:04:59.846
Do you realize
what you have done?

1:04:59.890 --> 1:05:02.597
You have destroyed one of
the great travelling mirrors.

1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:03.891
- [Tony] We weren't even --
- [Virginia] Wait wait wait.

1:05:03.940 --> 1:05:06.352
Did you just say "one" of
the travelling mirrors?

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.392
- As in, there are others?

1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:10.771
- You wish to smash
the other two as well?

1:05:10.820 --> 1:05:13.357
- No! No! No! We need them
but where can we find them?

1:05:13.410 --> 1:05:15.480
- You will find only death here.

1:05:15.530 --> 1:05:17.578
Take them to the old
shaft and throw them in.

1:05:17.620 --> 1:05:20.783
(dwarfs murmuring)
(dramatic music)

1:05:20.830 --> 1:05:22.991
- No no no, look
look look, wait!

1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:24.917
- Wait!

1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:26.075
Look.

1:05:26.130 --> 1:05:27.870
Look in the truth mirror.

1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:29.160
Look!

1:05:29.210 --> 1:05:30.791
It's Prince Wendell.

1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:34.469
Grandson of the greatest
woman that's ever lived.

1:05:34.510 --> 1:05:36.671
- That's right! That's the guy.

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.802
_ _ And I am his
indispensable translator.

1:05:38.850 --> 1:05:41.922
- What magic is this?

1:05:41.980 --> 1:05:44.301
Who are you strange travelers?

1:05:44.350 --> 1:05:47.308
- We're, um, on
a secret mission!

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:50.432
To restore Prince Wendell
to his original form.

1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:52.812
I am a very important person.

1:05:52.860 --> 1:05:55.818
- Long have the stories
been told of this day

1:05:55.860 --> 1:05:59.489
when a proud prince
would stand before us

1:05:59.530 --> 1:06:02.829
on four legs!

1:06:02.870 --> 1:06:04.360
- Yeah, well this is the day.

1:06:05.330 --> 1:06:09.369
- Oh! I've banged my sodding
oafing head 200 times!

1:06:09.420 --> 1:06:11.411
- Just be careful!

1:06:12.300 --> 1:06:14.712
- I hate dwarves!

1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:17.581
First dwarf I see,
I'll kebab him!

1:06:17.640 --> 1:06:18.959
(trolls laughing)

1:06:19.010 --> 1:06:20.750
- If they see a troll,
they'll be on you like

1:06:20.810 --> 1:06:24.428
a pack of hounds and they'll
tear you limb from limb!

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:25.845
- Shut it!

1:06:25.890 --> 1:06:29.724
What are we, trolls or mice?

1:06:29.770 --> 1:06:31.351
- We're trolls!

1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:33.777
Trolls afraid of nothing!

1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:39.739
- Dwarves have mined in these
caves for thousands of years.

1:06:39.780 --> 1:06:43.534
In the early days, we
suffered terrible losses

1:06:43.580 --> 1:06:46.492
because the caves were
overrun With dragons.

1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:50.032
You see, these caves
contain quicksilver, which,

1:06:50.090 --> 1:06:53.582
I'm sure you know male
dragons are addicted to.

1:06:53.630 --> 1:06:56.212
Ah!

1:06:56.260 --> 1:06:58.296
This is extremely quicksilver.

1:06:58.340 --> 1:07:01.673
Ordinary quicksilver is much
too slow for magic mirrors.

1:07:02.850 --> 1:07:05.671
Most attempts to make a
magic mirror fail completely.

1:07:05.730 --> 1:07:07.186
They just reflect.

1:07:07.230 --> 1:07:10.188
But sometimes, with the
help of great dwarf experts.

1:07:10.230 --> 1:07:12.471
- Ow!

1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:14.147
- You're not suffering
from bad luck are you?

1:07:14.190 --> 1:07:16.238
- We're looking for a travelling
mirror to replace the one

1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:17.645
that was broken.

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:18.769
- Yeah which we had
nothing to do with.

1:07:18.820 --> 1:07:19.900
- Yeah.

1:07:19.950 --> 1:07:21.520
- Travelling mirrors.

1:07:24.950 --> 1:07:28.078
I doubt if our records
go that far back.

1:07:28.120 --> 1:07:29.826
Yes.

1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.529
Just as I thought.

1:07:31.590 --> 1:07:33.876
There is one other
slender chance.

1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:36.969
Let's _see if we
can raise Gustav.

1:07:37.010 --> 1:07:39.547
Come. He's over there.

1:07:40.930 --> 1:07:44.764
(majestic music)

1:07:44.810 --> 1:07:46.050
Gustav!

1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:47.840
You have a visitor.

1:07:47.890 --> 1:07:50.267
You have to speak
up, he's rather deaf.

1:07:51.650 --> 1:07:55.279
- Um, Gustav we need
to ask you a question.

1:07:56.280 --> 1:07:58.646
-Hm?

1:07:58.700 --> 1:08:00.099
- A question!

1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:02.367
About travelling mirrors!

1:08:02.410 --> 1:08:06.369
- An answer only will I chime

1:08:06.410 --> 1:08:09.402
when questions put
are asked in rhyme.

1:08:10.710 --> 1:08:13.622
- All early mirrors
talk in verse.

1:08:13.670 --> 1:08:15.240
- Yes of course.

1:08:18.300 --> 1:08:22.634
- Where there any other
travelling mirrors made,

1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:26.093
that could help us
with our escapade?

1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:27.346
- Escapade.

1:08:27.390 --> 1:08:31.599
- Three fine mirrors
that were made,

1:08:31.650 --> 1:08:35.814
to make them, such
a price was paid.

1:08:35.860 --> 1:08:38.738
- Right, right. Where
are the other two?

1:08:38.780 --> 1:08:39.940
(Gustav groans)

1:08:39.990 --> 1:08:43.869
- Um, our mirror's
smashed, what can we do?

1:08:43.910 --> 1:08:46.538
Where the hell
are the other two?

1:08:46.580 --> 1:08:50.118
- Mirror one shattered be,

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:54.494
by an oaf called Anthony.

1:08:54.540 --> 1:08:55.871
(Anthony grumbles)

1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:58.457
Mirror two is one a bed,

1:08:58.510 --> 1:09:02.628
with barnacles upon its head.

1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:05.501
- Bed. With barnacles.

1:09:05.550 --> 1:09:06.756
- The seabed.

1:09:06.810 --> 1:09:09.017
- Yes, one fell into
the great Northern Sea.

1:09:09.060 --> 1:09:11.472
I think you can safely
discount that one.

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:15.604
- What you seek
has not been seen,

1:09:15.650 --> 1:09:20.144
since it was stolen
by the Queen.

1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:24.659
- The Queen? That's all we need.

1:09:24.700 --> 1:09:27.328
- [Wendell] Anthony! Any
chance of a little biscuit?

1:09:27.370 --> 1:09:29.326
- No no no, um...

1:09:29.370 --> 1:09:33.659
very helpful of you of, uh, be

1:09:33.710 --> 1:09:35.826
just tell us where we
can find the Queen.

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:40.374
- Near, she is but not alone,

1:09:40.420 --> 1:09:44.424
in a place that's not her home.

1:09:44.470 --> 1:09:48.383
In a castle out of sight,

1:09:48.430 --> 1:09:53.299
where once the Queen
was called Snow White.

1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:55.680
- It's Prince Wendell's castle.

1:09:55.730 --> 1:09:57.641
Oh, I knew it.

1:09:57.690 --> 1:09:59.510
I don't think --
(clattering)

1:09:59.570 --> 1:10:03.392
(smashing)

1:10:12.830 --> 1:10:14.115
- Murderers!

1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:16.321
You've murdered my mirrors!

1:10:16.370 --> 1:10:18.167
They are murderers, kill them!

1:10:18.210 --> 1:10:19.780
Kill them!
(dramatic music)

1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:22.502
(dwarfs shouting)

1:10:24.170 --> 1:10:26.798
Quick! Sound the alarm!

1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:27.795
(whistling)

1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:31.307
- What was that?

1:10:31.350 --> 1:10:33.090
(whistling)
(trolls screaming)

1:10:35.190 --> 1:10:36.054
- [Virginia] We
need to disappear.

1:10:36.100 --> 1:10:37.089
- [Tony] Yeah, I know but,

1:10:37.150 --> 1:10:38.515
all right, come on go down here.

1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:39.606
They won't follow us down here.

1:10:39.650 --> 1:10:41.857
I'll be right behind you!

1:10:45.070 --> 1:10:48.813
(Tony whelping)

1:10:49.700 --> 1:10:53.192
(Virginia screaming)

1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:06.508
' [Virginia] Are you okay?
' [TONY] No, I'm not okay!

1:11:06.550 --> 1:11:08.506
I don't know how much
more of this I can take!

1:11:08.550 --> 1:11:09.676
- You've gotta be more careful.

1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:12.177
- It's not my fault.
It's my bad luck.

1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:15.018
How much worse is
it gonna be now?

1:11:16.270 --> 1:11:18.807
(screaming)

1:11:18.850 --> 1:11:21.011
- Dad?

1:11:21.060 --> 1:11:22.971
Dad?

1:11:34.830 --> 1:11:35.899
Are you all right?

1:11:35.950 --> 1:11:37.781
- Uh, I did
something really bad.

1:11:37.830 --> 1:11:40.412
Something cracked, I can't move.

1:11:40.460 --> 1:11:42.667
- All right, I'm
gonna help you --

1:11:42.710 --> 1:11:45.508
- Ah, no, no!

1:11:45.550 --> 1:11:48.428
I may have broken my back.

1:11:48.470 --> 1:11:49.755
- Okay.

1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:51.961
Okay, um...

1:11:52.010 --> 1:11:55.093
well we're gonna have to
find another way out of here.

1:11:55.140 --> 1:11:59.349
We can't go back the
way we came so, um.

1:11:59.390 --> 1:12:00.800
- I don't wanna die in here.

1:12:00.850 --> 1:12:03.648
- We're not gonna die, we're
gonna find a way out of here!

1:12:03.690 --> 1:12:06.523
- I can't help
you, I can't move.

1:12:08.450 --> 1:12:10.850
- Well then I'm just gonna
go on alone and I'm gonna

1:12:10.910 --> 1:12:14.277
find a way out and I'm
gonna come back and get you.

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:15.979
Okay? Maybe Prince can
smell out fresh air.

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:17.280
- Too many tunnels,
too many tunnels.

1:12:17.330 --> 1:12:18.570
You won't find your way back.

1:12:18.620 --> 1:12:20.281
- I will find a way out

1:12:20.330 --> 1:12:22.958
and I will come back
and get you, okay?

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.298
I promise.

1:12:27.550 --> 1:12:31.372
I'm gonna leave a
trail of breadcrumbs.

1:12:31.430 --> 1:12:33.751
So that I can find you.

1:12:35.890 --> 1:12:38.677
- Virginia.

1:12:39.930 --> 1:12:42.763
Make sure you get yourself out.

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:48.276
- I'm coming back.

1:12:55.950 --> 1:12:58.282
(Wendell whimpering)

1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:15.404
"For seven men
she gave her life.

1:14:16.610 --> 1:14:21.445
"For one good man
she was his wife.

1:14:22.700 --> 1:14:27.490
"Beneath the ice
by Snow White falls

1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:33.835
"there lies the
fairest of them all."

1:14:36.970 --> 1:14:40.599
(harrowing music)

1:14:55.110 --> 1:14:57.237
- [Voiceover] Virginia!

1:15:01.660 --> 1:15:03.821
- Hello, Virginia.

1:15:06.330 --> 1:15:08.628
You look tired.

1:15:08.670 --> 1:15:11.628
- Are you dead?

1:15:11.670 --> 1:15:13.240
- Well, yes.

1:15:13.300 --> 1:15:15.621
I think you'd have to say so.

1:15:15.670 --> 1:15:18.218
I'm more into the fairy
godmother occasional appearance

1:15:18.260 --> 1:15:19.966
sort of thing now.

1:15:21.300 --> 1:15:23.712
But I still have
influence over things

1:15:23.770 --> 1:15:25.977
and I have been protecting
you in other ways.

1:15:26.020 --> 1:15:29.763
Shielding your image from
the mirrors of the Queen.

1:15:31.020 --> 1:15:32.976
But soon, Virginia,

1:15:33.020 --> 1:15:36.729
you'll have to see and be seen.

1:15:36.780 --> 1:15:38.236
- I don't understand.

1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:39.190
(Wendell barking)

1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:41.868
- Hey! (chuckles)

1:15:41.910 --> 1:15:43.366
What do you think
of my grandson, huh?

1:15:43.410 --> 1:15:45.150
- I like him.

1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:47.998
- Yes, I think being a dog
has been very good for him.

1:15:48.040 --> 1:15:49.246
- But he's losing his mind.

1:15:49.290 --> 1:15:51.702
- That is why you
must now take charge.

1:15:51.750 --> 1:15:54.378
He needs you to save
his kingdom, we all do.

1:15:54.420 --> 1:15:55.705
- Me?

1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:58.923
No, I think you have
the wrong person.

1:15:58.970 --> 1:16:01.211
- I have the right person.

1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:05.216
I've been waiting
for you, Virginia.

1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:09.632
You see, my mother was a Queen

1:16:09.690 --> 1:16:12.807
and everyday she would
sit by the window sewing,

1:16:12.860 --> 1:16:15.146
staring at the falling snow

1:16:15.190 --> 1:16:17.681
longing to have a baby girl.

1:16:19.070 --> 1:16:22.654
And one day, she pricked
her finger on a needle

1:16:22.700 --> 1:16:25.863
and onto the snow fell
three drops of blood

1:16:25.910 --> 1:16:29.744
and she knew then that she
would die giving birth to me.

1:16:31.250 --> 1:16:34.333
My father was sad
for a very long time,

1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:37.759
but he remarried eventually
because he was lonely

1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:40.872
and my new mother brought
no possessions to the castle

1:16:40.930 --> 1:16:43.797
except for her magic mirrors.

1:16:43.850 --> 1:16:46.421
And everyday she would
lock her bedroom door,

1:16:46.470 --> 1:16:48.017
she would take off
all her clothes,

1:16:48.060 --> 1:16:50.847
and she_ would look in
the mirror and say,

1:16:50.890 --> 1:16:53.188
"Mirror mirror on the wall,

1:16:53.230 --> 1:16:56.222
"who is the fairest
of them all?"

1:16:56.270 --> 1:16:58.738
And the mirror would reply,

1:16:58.780 --> 1:17:02.568
"My lady is the
fairest of them all."

1:17:02.610 --> 1:17:04.692
And this would satisfy her
for she knew that mirrors

1:17:04.740 --> 1:17:06.731
spoke the truth.

1:17:08.490 --> 1:17:11.709
But I was growing older and
by the time I was seven,

1:17:11.750 --> 1:17:14.457
I was as pretty as you.

1:17:14.500 --> 1:17:17.162
And one day when the
Queen asked her mirror,

1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:21.837
"My lady Queen it's fair to see,

1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:25.839
"that Snow White is
fairer far than thee."

1:17:25.890 --> 1:17:28.506
And my stepmother called
her huntsman and said,

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:30.551
"Take this child into
the forest, I am sick

1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:32.761
"of the sight of her."

1:17:32.810 --> 1:17:36.394
Can you image that
moment, Virginia?

1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:39.728
When you realize that you're
so awful that your own mother

1:17:39.780 --> 1:17:43.659
wants you murdered?

1:17:43.700 --> 1:17:46.658
When the huntsman raised his
knife, I fell to my knees

1:17:46.700 --> 1:17:49.737
and I begged him,
"Let me live, please!

1:17:49.790 --> 1:17:52.657
"Let me live."

1:17:52.710 --> 1:17:55.076
And he put his knife away.

1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:58.248
I was so terrified I ran
straight into the darkness.

1:17:58.290 --> 1:18:00.838
I ran until I was
exhausted and then,

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:03.678
right in front of me there
was this little cottage.

1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:05.290
- Oh, the cottage we found!

1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:07.922
- Yes of course, and when
I went inside everything

1:18:07.970 --> 1:18:09.710
was the perfect size for me.

1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:12.228
On the table there
was set seven plates,

1:18:12.270 --> 1:18:14.056
and when I went upstairs
there were seven beds

1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:16.091
all in a row.

1:18:16.150 --> 1:18:19.563
I was so tired I
fell fast asleep.

1:18:19.610 --> 1:18:21.771
And when I woke up there were
these men coming up the stairs

1:18:21.820 --> 1:18:23.731
and they had lamps,
they were mining lamps

1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:26.772
swinging back and forth
like fireflies in the night

1:18:26.820 --> 1:18:29.323
and I was frozen with fear

1:18:29.370 --> 1:18:32.533
and when they saw me
they all said as one,

1:18:32.580 --> 1:18:35.492
"What a lovely little girl."

1:18:35.540 --> 1:18:37.667
They told me that if
I kept the house clean

1:18:37.710 --> 1:18:39.780
and I did the cooking and
the washing and the sewing

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:42.627
and the knitting and
kept everything spotless,

1:18:42.670 --> 1:18:46.299
that I could stay and I would
never wont for anything.

1:18:47.800 --> 1:18:49.848
I told them about my
stepmother and they became

1:18:49.890 --> 1:18:51.710
very paranoid about her.

1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:53.842
They told me never to go
into town and never to

1:18:53.890 --> 1:18:55.687
open the door to strangers.

1:18:57.600 --> 1:18:59.898
Her mirrors found me eventually.

1:18:59.940 --> 1:19:01.896
She dressed as an old
peddler and climbed over the

1:19:01.940 --> 1:19:04.647
seven hills to my house.

1:19:04.690 --> 1:19:08.865
Twice she came, once with
a corset to crush my ribs

1:19:08.910 --> 1:19:12.698
and then with a poison
comb to drug me.

1:19:12.740 --> 1:19:14.822
But the last time she came,

1:19:14.870 --> 1:19:18.658
she brought the most
beautiful basket of apples

1:19:18.710 --> 1:19:21.622
that I ever saw.

1:19:21.670 --> 1:19:25.162
And this time she _
stayed to watch me die.

1:19:25.210 --> 1:19:28.759
And to be sure, she
held me in her arms

1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:31.428
until I died in
front of her choking

1:19:31.470 --> 1:19:35.588
on a piece of poison apple.

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:38.632
And I often think,

1:19:38.690 --> 1:19:40.851
"Why did I let her in?

1:19:40.900 --> 1:19:43.812
"Didn't I know she was bad?"

1:19:43.860 --> 1:19:45.487
I did.

1:19:45.530 --> 1:19:48.101
Of course I did.

1:19:48.150 --> 1:19:50.311
But I also knew,

1:19:50.360 --> 1:19:53.443
that I couldn't keep the
door closed all my life

1:19:53.490 --> 1:19:55.446
just because it was dangerous,

1:19:55.500 --> 1:19:59.288
just because there was a
chance that I might get hurt.

1:20:02.290 --> 1:20:04.747
- Tell me what all of
this has to do with me.

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:08.042
- Everything.

1:20:08.090 --> 1:20:09.830
You're cold.

1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:11.836
You're cold, Virginia.

1:20:11.890 --> 1:20:14.802
How did you become so cold?

1:20:17.730 --> 1:20:20.688
You are still lost
in the forest,

1:20:20.730 --> 1:20:24.939
but lonely lost girls like
us can rescue themselves.

1:20:24.980 --> 1:20:28.393
You are standing on
the edge of greatness.

1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:30.817
- No I'm not.

1:20:30.860 --> 1:20:34.409
I'm not, I'm
nothing, I'm useless.

1:20:34.450 --> 1:20:37.408
- You will one day be like me.

1:20:37.450 --> 1:20:41.159
You will be a great adviser
to other lost girls.

1:20:43.420 --> 1:20:45.160
Now...

1:20:45.210 --> 1:20:47.041
stand up.

1:20:47.090 --> 1:20:48.330
Stand up.

1:20:53.510 --> 1:20:55.137
This mirror will
show you what you do

1:20:55.180 --> 1:20:57.387
and do not want to see.

1:20:59.770 --> 1:21:01.590
Poison is the way
the Queen will strike

1:21:01.640 --> 1:21:03.688
and the way she
must be defeated.

1:21:03.730 --> 1:21:08.178
You must find the poison comb
she tried to kill me with.

1:21:09.900 --> 1:21:11.856
- But what can I
do all by myself?

1:21:11.900 --> 1:21:13.982
- Do not cling to what you know.

1:21:14.030 --> 1:21:15.611
Do not think.

1:21:15.660 --> 1:21:17.400
Become.

1:21:20.750 --> 1:21:22.115
- My light's going out.

1:21:22.160 --> 1:21:23.957
- Let your light go out.

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.740
Embrace the darkness.

1:21:25.790 --> 1:21:27.997
- No, but I can't find
my way out in the dark!

1:21:28.050 --> 1:21:31.542
- You may ask for one wish,

1:21:31.590 --> 1:21:34.252
and I will try and grant
it but be sure to ask

1:21:34.300 --> 1:21:36.677
for the right thing.

1:21:37.890 --> 1:21:40.518
- Okay.

1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:43.688
Iwish...

1:21:43.730 --> 1:21:45.641
I wish that Dad's
bad luck was over.

1:21:45.690 --> 1:21:49.069
Oh, and that his back
wasn't broken anymore!

1:21:49.110 --> 1:21:52.648
- Strictly speaking,
that's two wishes.

1:21:52.700 --> 1:21:54.486
But it's done.

1:21:56.990 --> 1:21:59.402
Your father is in great
danger, you must go to him.

1:21:59.450 --> 1:22:00.530
- Okay but how do I find --

1:22:00.580 --> 1:22:01.990
- Now. Go to him now.

1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:03.655
Immediately.

1:22:14.630 --> 1:22:18.009
(Tony groaning)

1:22:22.020 --> 1:22:25.649
- [Tony] Oh, Virginia!

1:22:25.690 --> 1:22:28.978
I was just about
to lose my mind!

1:22:29.020 --> 1:22:32.103
Just about given up all hope.

1:22:32.150 --> 1:22:34.527
- That was the
right thing to do.

1:22:35.700 --> 1:22:38.157
I move slowly,

1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:40.987
but I always get what I want.

1:22:42.540 --> 1:22:46.988
Where's the dog called Prince?

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:50.032
Where's the girl?

1:22:50.090 --> 1:22:51.796
- Just go to hell.

1:22:53.670 --> 1:22:57.583
- [Huntsman] I will
not ask you again.

1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:00.712
- Go ahead, kill me, I
don't even care anymore!

1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:03.558
- You will tell me everything

1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:06.182
long before you die.

1:23:11.940 --> 1:23:13.316
- Get up and come with me.

1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:15.692
- Well I can't get
up, my back is broken.

1:23:15.740 --> 1:23:17.605
- No it's not.

1:23:20.780 --> 1:23:21.940
- Hey!

1:23:21.990 --> 1:23:24.072
It does feel better.

1:23:25.710 --> 1:23:28.452
Oh my god, how did that happen?

1:23:29.790 --> 1:23:32.247
- I have found the
most wonderful thing.

1:23:32.290 --> 1:23:33.746
- What? You found a way out?

1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:34.664
- Better.

1:23:34.710 --> 1:23:35.870
- Better?

1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:37.581
Wait a minute, you
mean to tell me that

1:23:37.630 --> 1:23:38.676
there's something
better than the way out?

1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:41.006
- [Virginia] Yes.
- [Tony] What?

1:23:42.050 --> 1:23:43.756
Oh, come on.

1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:47.629
- Look.

1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:55.816
- What?

1:23:55.860 --> 1:23:57.691
- No, it...

1:23:57.740 --> 1:23:59.810
she was here.

1:23:59.860 --> 1:24:01.191
It was...

1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:05.233
- What? So did you
find a way out?

1:24:05.290 --> 1:24:06.279
- Yes.

1:24:07.660 --> 1:24:08.536
(blows)

1:24:08.580 --> 1:24:09.706
- Wait wait, what are you doing?

1:24:09.750 --> 1:24:11.820
- Shh! Listen.

1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:13.871
(running water)

1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:15.797
Can you hear that?

1:24:29.690 --> 1:24:34.354
(uplifting music)

1:24:48.830 --> 1:24:51.537
(laughing) We did it!

1:24:59.420 --> 1:25:02.048
- I think...

1:25:02.090 --> 1:25:04.467
I think we're back
in the 4th Kingdom.

1:25:07.430 --> 1:25:10.763
Where did you get that?

1:25:10.810 --> 1:25:13.552
- Mirror mirror in my hand,

1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:16.569
who is fairest in the land?

1:25:25.830 --> 1:25:26.899
- [Tony] It's Christine.

1:25:26.950 --> 1:25:28.076
- No.

1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:31.780
No, it can't be.

1:25:31.830 --> 1:25:33.411
- What?

1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:36.586
It's her.

1:25:36.630 --> 1:25:38.416
My god, that's your mother.

1:25:42.260 --> 1:25:45.138
- Someone is watching me.

1:25:49.890 --> 1:25:51.926
- [Virginia] It's
Mom, that's Mom.

1:25:54.150 --> 1:25:55.549
Wait!

1:25:56.980 --> 1:26:00.359
- Someone is spying on me.

1:26:03.990 --> 1:26:05.867
- No no no, it can't be.

1:26:05.910 --> 1:26:08.117
That was Mom.

1:26:11.540 --> 1:26:13.656
She's here?

1:26:13.710 --> 1:26:15.826
How is that possible?

1:26:17.750 --> 1:26:21.914
(eerie music)

1:26:34.270 --> 1:26:36.647
I thought you said she
was living in Miami?

1:26:36.690 --> 1:26:38.760
- I didn't know where she was,
I had to tell you something.

1:26:38.810 --> 1:26:41.187
You were always asking me.

1:26:42.650 --> 1:26:44.060
- Why did you throw the
mirror way, I mean --

1:26:44.110 --> 1:26:46.738
- Well because if we
can see her, it means,

1:26:46.780 --> 1:26:47.940
maybe she can see us.

1:26:47.990 --> 1:26:50.367
- And what?

1:26:50.410 --> 1:26:51.536
What do you think
she's gonna do?

1:26:51.580 --> 1:26:53.741
- I don't know!

1:26:56.500 --> 1:26:58.741
- How did she get here?

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:17.798
I'm wishing on a star

1:27:19.980 --> 1:27:24.098
To follow where you are

1:27:26.860 --> 1:27:30.864
I'm wishing on a dream

1:27:33.370 --> 1:27:37.454
To follow what it means

1:27:40.250 --> 1:27:44.584
And I wish on all the rainbows

1:27:44.630 --> 1:27:46.871
That I see

1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:51.755
I wish on all the people who

1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:55.713
Really dream

1:28:00.350 --> 1:28:03.319
I'm wishing on a star
