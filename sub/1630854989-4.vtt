This programme contains
very strong language.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.960
This Cindy,

00:16.960 --> 00:20.680
she's hiding something from us.
She has already got a man.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.120
You know what you're doing
with that, yeah?

00:24.080 --> 00:26.200
It's not my first rodeo.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.800
How d'you know my mother?
Your mother?

00:29.800 --> 00:32.560
The truth is,
you've got nothing and you know it.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.760
We own this land now.
What do we know about building?

00:40.760 --> 00:43.040
Who actually builds these places?

00:43.040 --> 00:45.520
Gitanos. Local gypsies.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.560
Let's break bread with the Gitanos.
What's the worst that can happen?

00:50.560 --> 00:54.600
I make you right. The Gitanos weren't
showing you the respect you deserve.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.600
The gun was empty!

01:04.800 --> 01:06.720
You'll never put up your hotel.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.360

04:34.920 --> 04:37.200
Til my dad tried to
kill her old man.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.200
Wasn't exactly a charm offensive.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.600
Yeah.
He's offensive without the charm.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.080
Well surely with all your charm,
it's worth a final try?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.120
'What were you expecting, Albert?'

Peace pipes with the Gitanos

after you tried to stick a bullet

04:57.960 --> 05:01.800
Gene, he made me beg...
like a child.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.600
Takes a big man to seek forgiveness, Alb.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.120
Swallow.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.240
You'll always be
the power in this family.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.280
No one can rally the troops
like you.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.000
But maybe it's time to delegate.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.960
Swallow.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.040
Empower your boys.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.000
Make them feel valuable.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.960
Tell them what they need to hear.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.720
But never forget...

05:34.720 --> 05:36.720
you're the Gansa Macher.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.840
'But what would I say?'

05:39.840 --> 05:43.440
'That he's a little man
with big ideas about himself,

05:43.440 --> 05:45.600
'and they don't have to
deal with him...

05:45.600 --> 05:47.960
You're forgetting
he owns the land, Cind.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.360
Look, just get Lola and the Gitanos
back onside and he'll see sense.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.400
Money talks, trust me.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.080
You gave up everything for me.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.520
And I'd do it again
in a heartbeat.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.880
Then let's do this together.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.880
We'll set up a meet with Lola.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.880
For us.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.720
Fuck the rest of them.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.520
Let's hope she's in a better mood
than her old man.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.520
Fuck.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.760
We thought we'd save you the trip
this time.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.520
Maybe I wasn't clear last we talked.

06:54.520 --> 06:57.400
We want nothing to do
with you Lords.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.440
Two minutes is all we need.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.400
Por favor, Senora.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.960
I swear to you, it'll be worth it.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.800
These are the plans my uncle left.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.200
It'll provide work
for your whole community.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.000
You really think
we'll pack up and leave, huh?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.960
For some scraps of work?

07:26.080 --> 07:27.720
I'm not suggesting that.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.000
I have this land in my blood,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.400
like my father
and his father before him.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.680
We are not going anywhere, OK?

07:35.680 --> 07:37.880
So please leave,
while I'm still in a good mood.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.520
Thank you.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.680
Lola.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.160
Do you really want to ignore someone
who talks to you like an equal

07:45.160 --> 07:48.840
and wants your people to prosper, hmm?

07:48.840 --> 07:51.160
Who has ever done anything
for your lot?

07:52.920 --> 07:55.280
We don't work for no one...

07:55.280 --> 07:56.920
ever!

07:56.920 --> 07:58.800
OK?

08:03.360 --> 08:05.080
But partners...

08:06.280 --> 08:07.360
...maybe?

08:08.560 --> 08:11.480
Yeah? You have collateral?

08:11.480 --> 08:13.840
Certainly fucking do.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.840
One hundred blocks.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.400
Each one weighs one kilo.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.440
You know how much that's worth?

08:32.200 --> 08:34.720
It's still soft. Where'd you get it?

08:36.120 --> 08:39.400
Dutch smugglers landed it
in our cove from Morocco...

08:40.480 --> 08:42.240
...so we taxed them.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.640
Listen,
you wanna finance your hotel,

08:45.640 --> 08:47.400
you help me sell this.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.800
What do you get out of it?

08:52.760 --> 08:57.840
Twenty percent of everything.
The land. The hotel. Everything.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.680
Ten percent and we go to work.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.480
And make sure
you keep your dad sweet.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.080
I'll be in touch.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.880
Keep it.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.000
What do we know about drugs, Cind?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.640
Listen to me, heart.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.160
This is an opportunity, yeah?
A one-time deal to get some reddies.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.800
After that, we do it all
on the straight and narrow.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.440
Alright, fuck it!

09:52.480 --> 09:55.440
If we're gonna do this,
let's go all the way.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.680
Trust me?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.840
You know I do. Good.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.120
Cos puff won't build a hotel,
but cash will.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.200
And I think I might know
who can help...

10:11.960 --> 10:13.200
Ola.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.680
I'm looking for the owners
of that car there.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.040
Couple of well-dressed Dutch cats.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.600
No?

10:24.720 --> 10:27.920
You've got some fucking balls
showing up here.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.240
Easy, treacle, I come in peace.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.720
And you will leave in pieces.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.640
Don't play games, English.
Where is the rest of our hash?

10:36.640 --> 10:38.640
Back in your box, you Dutch fuck.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.720
Oi, sit down, you old cunt,
or I'll slash his throat.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.800
Listen, you boys will never land
another boat-load past the Gitanos.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.520
Not without us.
We can offer you safe passage.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.360
How?
None of your concern, top gun.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.080
First, we need to know
where you get it from.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.720
We have a Moroccan connection.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.840
Yeah? We want to meet 'em.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.960
Maybe we could set up a-
Are you fucking mad?

11:06.960 --> 11:09.080
Ey! Easy...

11:09.080 --> 11:12.000
Look, mate, introduce us

11:12.000 --> 11:14.080
and you'll get access
to the beach you paid for,

11:14.080 --> 11:17.440
and we'll guarantee
all future shipments get through.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.160
No more agg from the Gitanos.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.240
Put that knife down.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.800

Put that knife down!

11:25.800 --> 11:27.920
Put the gun down, you Dutch mug.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.600
Go on, put the gun down.
Put it down.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.960
So...

11:37.960 --> 11:39.680
we have a deal?

11:40.920 --> 11:43.640
You'll hook us up
with your Moroccan connection?

11:43.640 --> 11:45.080
Look...

11:45.080 --> 11:46.920
We're just little guys.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.160

you were released.

I tried to call you so-And what's
with all this 'Cindy' bullshit?

15:34.080 --> 15:37.200
I've not heard somebody
call you that since I was a kid.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.560

you'll be careful, alright?
Stay out of trouble?

not telling you she's got a kid

He didn't just bump into him.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.080
Yeah.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.200
Of course, it was you.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.680
Who else would stick their nose in?
I was looking out for you, son.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.440
Why don't I believe you, Mum?

17:39.160 --> 17:42.400
And you wonder why I wanted to
get the fuck away from you all.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.480
Gene.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.480
Is that it? Is that the bag?

17:50.480 --> 17:51.840
Yeah.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.800
Full of reddies.
All the way from London.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.600
He had a cricket bat, Dad.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.360
He nearly knocked me
into a cocked hat.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.040
But I grabbed the yogga and I go,
"Fucking open the fucking peter!"

18:06.040 --> 18:07.680
Like that.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.520
No, seriously,
there's blood on them reddies

18:10.520 --> 18:11.880
For you.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.360
Good boy.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.920
Go and check on your brother,
will you?

18:21.880 --> 18:23.880
One. One. Two. Good.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.480
Three. Five.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.920
Come on. One. One. Two.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.200
Come on. What did I say?
Concentrate. Keep you guard up.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.960
Grandad, watch this.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.960
Good boy. Give us a minute, Ant?

18:42.960 --> 18:44.960
Me and your Dad
have got to talk business.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.960
You told me to stay
and listen to the men talk.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.080
Yeah.
But now I'm telling you to fuck off.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.720
Go on, son.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.920
He's inherited your skills.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.280
And yours.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.720
This Cesar fella.
The Mayor?

19:19.080 --> 19:20.800
Can he be a friend?

19:23.800 --> 19:26.000
It's just... I see you talk to him.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.000
Mum certainly liked him.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.400
If he's the man down here,
and we wanna build stuff,

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
then we've gotta get him onside.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.200
So...

19:40.200 --> 19:42.000
you find out what he's about.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.880
And if he likes
a lick of the lolly...

19:48.680 --> 19:50.560
...offer him a taste.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.400
Why not Gene?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.320
Your brother's had his head spun.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.080
He's no value at the moment.

19:58.400 --> 20:02.120
Besides, I need my General on this.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.360
Come on.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.840
Man's shoulders.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.400
You can handle this.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.400
Dad...

20:23.120 --> 20:24.840
Don't do it again.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.240
Not in front of my wife.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.400
Please.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.400
Don't come back empty-handed, son.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.920
Come on, Kel, let's get a move on.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.880
Go.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.560
You're really gonna
meet the Moroccans without me?

21:04.240 --> 21:06.960
Don't you see this is
exactly what your Mum wanted?

21:06.960 --> 21:08.840
Us at each other's throats.

21:11.280 --> 21:14.560
Gene, please, we need each other.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.440
We were just getting somewhere.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.080
Come on mate, let's shake out.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.280
KELLY, FOR FUCK SAKE!!

21:28.240 --> 21:30.600
Why don't you just
fuck off back to London?

21:32.080 --> 21:34.080
And forget about the engagement.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.120
Give him time, girl.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.480
He just needs to cool off.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.760
We're going to Club Paradiso
for lunch, why don't you come along?

21:54.280 --> 21:56.080
Ever been in a Corniche, son?

21:57.640 --> 22:01.400

26:41.280 --> 26:43.800
Welcome. So, tell me...

26:45.680 --> 26:48.120
These Gitanos
are protective of their land.

26:48.720 --> 26:51.400
Anything that passes through it
is theirs for the taking.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.160
They call it a tax.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.720
The only problem is,
the land belongs to my family now,

26:56.720 --> 26:58.920
so it's not in their jurisdiction.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.840
So, that's where you come in?

27:00.840 --> 27:03.960
Correct.
And what do you get out of this?

27:04.880 --> 27:07.840
An opportunity
to meet your people in Africa.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.120
You've run hash before?
Listen, son. Listen, right.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.960
You lay it on us and we'll move it.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.720

27:22.200 --> 27:24.320
We're done here.
Tariq, please.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.160
Truth is,
we're out of our depth.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.080
We're on the street in London,
nothing more. Speak for yourself.

I'm not in charge of it.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.760
Stop!
Why?

29:01.760 --> 29:03.560
I need to check your bag?
Why?

29:03.560 --> 29:06.200
Oi! Cunt!
You tryna make out my boy's a thief?

29:06.200 --> 29:08.480
Exactly.
What you doing?

29:09.840 --> 29:12.000
Give me that!
You wanna check his bag?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.960
Yes.
Right, here goes.

29:13.960 --> 29:17.240
This is not your wallet, Sir.
I didn't take that, I swear.

29:17.240 --> 29:18.960
This is a respectable club.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.200
That how you operate, is it?

29:21.200 --> 29:24.400
Spot a dark mush
and try and set 'em up?

29:24.400 --> 29:26.040
That's right, pick it up!

29:26.040 --> 29:27.680

29:27.680 --> 29:30.480

30:10.560 --> 30:12.240

30:14.800 --> 30:17.560
Listen, I wanted to ask
your advice on something.

30:17.560 --> 30:19.920
We've been talking with the Gitanos

30:19.920 --> 30:24.000
about maybe throwing something up
on the land, together.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.640
Like what?

30:25.640 --> 30:27.400
Isn't it obvious?

30:27.400 --> 30:29.760
If you were a little less cryptic.

30:29.760 --> 30:33.040
Fucking hotels, mate.
What else d'you build on the Costa?

30:33.040 --> 30:37.120
Mr Lord, if you wish to submit
a planning application,

30:37.120 --> 30:39.360
you should contact my secretary.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.360
I was hoping we could swerve that.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.040
I beg your pardon?

30:52.320 --> 30:54.720
Thought you might fancy
a lick of the lolly.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.760

That's how you operate?

30:59.760 --> 31:02.280

planning permission,

31:14.160 --> 31:17.440
I suggest you make an appointment
for when I return.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.400
It can't wait.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.640
If it really can't wait...

31:30.120 --> 31:32.880
...I'm contactable here in Morocco.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.480

don't ever try to buy me again.

dad doesn't find out.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.400
Wait, Len. Hey, Len.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.640
It's alright, I'll sort it.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.840
Sort what, Kell?
What are you gonna sort?

35:34.840 --> 35:36.520
I'm just saying that, y'know.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.440
I'll take care of it,
you know what I'm like.

35:38.440 --> 35:41.040
I do know what you're like.
Stay the fuck out of it...

35:41.040 --> 35:42.800
Gene's better off without you.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.200
Are you alright, you wanna talk?

36:00.200 --> 36:02.320
I need to find Gene, Carly.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.000
I... He won't talk to me,

36:05.000 --> 36:06.960
he won't sleep in the same bed.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.880
I.. I gotta make things right.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.520
Oh, babe, he'll come round.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.560
He's nuts about you.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.520
And he seems lovely, your boy.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.200
Gene'll see that.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.000
He won't. Eddie's gone home.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.360
Oh.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.240
Oh, shame that.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.560
Gene needs you.

36:29.560 --> 36:34.840
He's out of his league making deals
with these Moroccans and Dutch.

36:34.840 --> 36:39.520
You know, Len reckons
it's all gonna go pear-shaped

36:39.520 --> 36:42.760
and Gene's bang in the middle of it.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.640
Where is he Carly?!

36:49.000 --> 36:51.480
Please
just fucking tell me where he is!

36:54.280 --> 36:56.000
You're out of time, English.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.840
I don't see anyone
coming to bail you out.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.200
Gitanos fucking you over too?

37:02.200 --> 37:04.320
Tariq, just a few more minutes.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.320
Ola.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.560
The traffic was murder.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.000
There's five more
where this came from.

37:51.920 --> 37:54.040
Lucky boys, huh?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.720
Looks like you got friends.
Load up the truck.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.120
Tariq, what about our deal?

38:02.760 --> 38:04.400
I'll be in touch.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.440
Fuck.

38:19.040 --> 38:22.080
Oh, don't tell me,
best fish in town?

38:23.600 --> 38:27.080
Easy boys, fingers off triggers.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.000
Now. Do you mind
if I take a look in the sack?

39:21.320 --> 39:23.120
Need to get you a new watch, Lola.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.560
I would have left you
hanging out there on your own,

39:25.560 --> 39:27.680
but she convinced me otherwise.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.720
For an extra ten percent,
of course.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.560
She knew the police were coming, Gene.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.760
He's been on your tail for days.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.640
And the oranges were
just a precaution.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.920
And as it turns out,
a necessary one.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.680
The truck's parked two streets away,
the rest in there.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.600
Don't call me a Dutch bastard again.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.720
Oh, whatever, bitch.
I am serious.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.440
Fuck off.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.760
You wanna be in the game
down here on the Costa,

39:55.760 --> 39:57.240
you'd better grow up fast.

39:57.240 --> 40:00.680
There's a lot of desert
to dig holes in, comprende?

40:01.600 --> 40:03.040
Sweet.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.480
Alright.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.480
Gene, let me explain.

40:26.440 --> 40:30.040
When Eddie's dad died,
I was on the bones of my arse.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.200
He got adopted, while I...

40:36.680 --> 40:39.480
While I continued to
fuck my life up.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.520
I was ashamed.

40:47.040 --> 40:50.040
I couldn't look after my child.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.760
Do you know how it feels
to lose your boy?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.800
Eddie was my life...

41:01.920 --> 41:03.680
...and I lost him.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.280
And now I've done it again.

41:14.520 --> 41:17.160
He's gone
because I can't look after him.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.720
You think I ain't made mistakes
in my life?

41:25.600 --> 41:28.600
Only difference between us, Cind,
is that I owned them.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.320
When I asked you to marry me,
I meant it.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.120
There is nothing
you don't know about me.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.080
Because I trusted you
with my fucking life.

41:34.080 --> 41:36.560
And this is how you repay me?
With these lies.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.040
I'm sorry.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.920
You and me both.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.080
Come on, let's go.

42:07.680 --> 42:10.320
How did you get the Gitanos
back to the table?

42:10.320 --> 42:12.320
The daughter, Lola,

42:12.320 --> 42:15.040
I talked to her on the level
and assured her we'd look after 'em.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.560
Right.
And what's this going to cost me?

42:17.560 --> 42:19.560
Just a bit of mutual respect, Alb.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.360
I'm proud of you, boy.

42:25.360 --> 42:27.160
You're your own man.

42:28.560 --> 42:32.160
Sometimes I hate you for that,
but you've got a fire in your belly.

42:34.200 --> 42:36.560
And you certainly know
how to pick the winner.

42:37.720 --> 42:41.160
It's me who should be thanking you,
- Dad.
- Well then do it... loudly.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.800
Come here.

42:47.840 --> 42:50.040
Thank you
for helping me get to Spain.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.920
For calling Tony
and making that happen.

42:53.800 --> 42:57.040
I was in trouble and you were
there for me when I needed you.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.160
That matters to me.
Good boy.

42:59.920 --> 43:02.080
He's gonna make me cry, here.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.800
We're almost a normal family, eh?
Yeah. Boat dreams.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.760
- Cheers.Cheers.
- Cheers.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.360
So what happens now?

43:17.640 --> 43:19.360
No more lies, alright.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.240
I have to be able to trust you...

43:21.240 --> 43:22.920
You can.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.320
Let's get back on track, yeah?

43:26.320 --> 43:28.640
We can still build our dream.

43:28.640 --> 43:34.240
My baby boy!
You've come back, I'm so happy.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.960
I've missed you.

43:35.960 --> 43:39.320
I thought you'd fucked off
- back to London?
- I changed my mind.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.560
I mean there's nothing there for me, now.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.760
If that's alright with you, Mum?
Yeah. Of course it is, babe.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.760
Here ya are, son.
And you guys, of course.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.320
You should have never left
in the first place!

43:51.560 --> 43:53.880
Do you want to get him
a drink of something?

43:54.440 --> 43:56.120
Yeah, Coke?
Yeah.

43:56.120 --> 43:58.440
Pedro! Here ya are, son.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.080
Alright, Dad.

44:24.360 --> 44:26.760
Give us one of those.
You alright, boy?

44:29.560 --> 44:31.480
You know me, Dad.
No bother.

44:33.480 --> 44:37.640
You know what I'm like,
I call it as I see it, don't I?

44:38.120 --> 44:40.120
No secrets, especially from you.

44:44.240 --> 44:46.680
There is something
you might wanna know...

44:47.720 --> 44:49.920
...about Gene's deal
with the Gitanos.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.080
Go on.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.680
Its this little trip
he's got planned to Morocco...

44:56.240 --> 44:58.480
...he's meeting
some drug dealers there.

45:06.600 --> 45:09.120
He'll tell you some shit
about importing oranges,

45:09.120 --> 45:10.800
but it's bollocks.

45:18.400 --> 45:22.720
So the Mayor goes to him,
"You play tennis?"

45:22.720 --> 45:25.560
And then Len went,
"Hardly John McEnroe".

45:25.560 --> 45:29.600
And then he goes,
"You cannot be serious?".

45:29.600 --> 45:32.440
And a few jokes later,

45:32.440 --> 45:35.920
Len got the Mayor
to give us planning permission.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.800
You done well, Len.
Making friends with the mayor,

45:38.800 --> 45:41.680
a strong move,
it'll pay dividends down the line.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.320
I'm proud of you, mukka.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.520
Thanks, dad.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.480
What next for you, Geno?
Any moves?

45:50.480 --> 45:52.880
On top of making peace
with the Gitanos...

45:54.320 --> 45:57.280
...I might have found a way
to raise some finance for the hotel.

45:57.280 --> 45:59.600
A little import-export thing.

45:59.600 --> 46:02.920
- Go on then.
- An opportunity's
opened up for us in Morocco.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.680
Nothing there but desert.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.280
And oranges.

46:08.640 --> 46:12.160
What are you gonna do?
Bring us back some fucking oranges?

46:12.160 --> 46:16.040
Fucking oranges is the only action
you're gonna get down here, kiddo.
