WEBVTT

00:14.431 --> 00:16.015
We tried to contact you
for weeks.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.767
Then we got busy
with production.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.269
But we made phone calls,
sent a telegram.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.937
We did finally
see your letter.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.481
A Mont Blanc
of mail had piled up.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.692
The reason
we were so persistent...

00:25.775 --> 00:27.152
Is that we have
a proposition.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.195
I don't know
if I've ever been propositioned

00:29.279 --> 00:32.698
by two young men at once.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.452
We want to bring
"The French Chef" out to LA,

00:35.535 --> 00:37.203
over to CBS.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.456
- The whole show?
- Every last stick of butter.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.957
We can offer
a really big salary.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.459
Generous
personal compensation.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.710
And we'll spend on production.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.462
It'll look like
a million bucks.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.922
- Like a real TV show.
- We're already real.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.799
This might help
you understand.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.684
- This would be Julia's salary?
- No.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.144
That's how many viewers
you have.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.854
- Mm-hmm.
- Not bad.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.897
Here's how many
you'd reach on CBS.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.154
You said in "Life" magazine
you want to change the way

01:11.237 --> 01:12.822
Americans think about food.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.492
And I do,
but what about my team?

01:15.575 --> 01:18.078
- My producer, Alice Naman?
- Bring her.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.497
The salary offer...

01:20.580 --> 01:23.541
Uh, Julia's salary offer,
you mean?

01:23.625 --> 01:25.126
My wife's a Stanford grad.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.170
But when it comes
to finances, it's--

01:27.253 --> 01:30.298
Ooh, no.
I don't think you understand.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.593
Here's a bigger note.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.303
I didn't look
at the first one.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.306
This is all entirely
Julia's decision.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.738
For starters, let's just
bring you out to LA

01:53.822 --> 01:55.240
for some meetings.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.783
- Oh, I grew up in Pasadena.
- Then you must miss it.

01:57.866 --> 01:59.494
Well, only the oranges.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.329
It is hard to find

02:01.413 --> 02:03.915
a truly handsome navel
on the East Coast.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.419
Egads, now what?

02:08.502 --> 02:10.088
Business cards.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.593
Should I write, "Thanks
for supporting television

02:15.677 --> 02:17.220
you can sink your teeth into"?

02:17.303 --> 02:20.181
They're for the WGBH Telethon.

02:20.265 --> 02:23.476
First 5 people to pledge $5...

02:23.560 --> 02:26.062
"Thanks for the dough."

02:26.146 --> 02:28.940
I-I think we should take
this seriously, Julia.

02:29.024 --> 02:31.735
Oh, right.
Just "bon appétit."

02:31.818 --> 02:35.113
- No, the--the CBS offer.
- Oh, yes, I know, Paulski.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.406
I don't disagree.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.283
Shall I tell them to set up
the week in LA?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.869
Uh, yes.
It couldn't hurt.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.747
But would you really want
to live in Los Angeles, Paul?

02:43.829 --> 02:45.957
We'd have to go around
on roller skates.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.917
I'm not half bad
on roller skates.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.210
I know it's a lot of money.

02:49.293 --> 02:51.212
It's what it would mean
for the show--

02:51.296 --> 02:52.756
reaching that many people.

02:52.839 --> 02:56.134
We didn't even own
a television until last year.

02:56.216 --> 02:57.385
But now we do,

02:57.469 --> 03:00.138
as do 20 million other
American households.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.639
Oh.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.600
And the money is nothing
to sneeze at either.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.693
Hunter?

03:13.777 --> 03:17.030
You want to run
through the intro again?

03:17.113 --> 03:18.656
Are you listening to me?

03:18.740 --> 03:20.992
- Hmm?
- The intro.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.494
Right.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.790
Uh, welcome to
the 10th annual WGBH Telethon,

03:26.873 --> 03:30.418
your chance to support
a station where--

03:30.502 --> 03:33.088
Roland just went
into the conference room.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.589
Yeah, that's not it.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.424
Hal's been having
meetings all day,

03:36.508 --> 03:37.884
with everybody except me,

03:37.966 --> 03:39.844
because the meetings
are about me.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.430
He's already threatened
to replace me.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.349
I haven't been in.
It's nothing.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.559
Elaine had a muffin!

03:46.643 --> 03:49.062
If these are muffin-level
meetings, it's not nothin'--

03:49.145 --> 03:51.398
not nothing!

03:51.481 --> 03:54.901
Hal's been asking everybody
who should get my job.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.486
You're being paranoid.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.655
We actually have a lot
to get through here.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.281
Right.
Sorry.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.664
- Our set was better.
- Much better.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.457
It's maddening...
and annoying.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.126
I'm more
in the "get even" camp.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.086
For every no I get,
I go after two yeses.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.087
Hmm.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.463
I took two big swings
this week.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.464
- All right, tell me.
- Well, the first one is--

04:17.548 --> 04:19.676
I'm going to get
Julia booked on Johnny Carson.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.761
What?
She's in "Life" magazine.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.805
Johnny Carson had Eva Gabor
on last night.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.473
- I said it was a big swing.
- Ooh, boy.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.851
- All right, what's the second?
- The White House.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.270
- Julia for president?
- No, no.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.106
But I hope that I can get her
into their kitchen.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.111
- Cranberry, nice.
- Those weren't for you.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.946
And you pulled me
out of a meeting, Hunter.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.407
You'll be glad I did.
Take a look.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.825
The sign's bigger.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.870
The telephone number
is so much more memorable.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.788
See how many fives
there are now?

04:48.872 --> 04:50.331
That's strategic.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.543
Also, uh, we've installed
three extra phones,

04:53.626 --> 04:56.129
because it's going to be
a crackerjack year.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.881
How crackerjack?

04:57.964 --> 05:02.260
Hal, we're about
to raise $2,500.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.137
Right.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.514
- I have a meeting.
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.016
He's impressed.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.143
$2,500?

05:10.226 --> 05:12.062
Last year, we made $612.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.272
The boss respects
ambition, Alice.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.112
Please don't say
the ceiling is leaking.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.947
No, the ceiling is intact.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.741
This is just--

05:24.824 --> 05:26.826
it's a gift
that was sent here for me.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.662
Oh.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.082
"It's always sunny
in Los Angeles.

05:32.165 --> 05:36.044
From your good friends at CBS."

05:38.630 --> 05:40.840
You have good friends at CBS?

05:40.924 --> 05:43.093
Well, that's a bit forward.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.637
I have acquaintances at CBS.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.182
Are they weathermen?

05:49.265 --> 05:52.102
We had lunch,
and I'd lost my umbrella,

05:52.185 --> 05:55.772
so this is just a little joke.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.234
Hmm.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.778
Well, that's...

06:01.861 --> 06:03.655
that's--that's nice.

06:05.365 --> 06:09.577
So is CBS wooing you?

06:09.661 --> 06:11.079
They read the "Life" article.

06:11.162 --> 06:15.083
Well, so did a lot of people,
but you only got one umbrella.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.003
I should introduce you
to them.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.463
You'd knock their socks off.

06:20.547 --> 06:24.801
And maybe you could talk to CBS
about "By Women, For Women."

06:24.884 --> 06:26.344
Now, that's a thought.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.222
Well, I have some
big new ideas for us here,

06:29.305 --> 06:30.682
at GBH.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.101
Yes, Of course you do.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.397
Well, tonight
is a long night,

06:37.480 --> 06:40.191
so rest when you can.

06:40.275 --> 06:43.028
It really makes a difference
that you're here, you know.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.241
Oh, Paul, Julia.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.701
Judith.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.245
- I didn't know you'd be here.
- Oh.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.456
Uh, Blanche made me try again
with the Plath estate,

06:54.539 --> 06:57.375
and I couldn't come to Boston
and not say a quick hello.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.669
I'm on the next train home.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.046
You look a bit grim.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.381
Well, they're jumping ship
to Faber & Faber.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.884
Did you know there was
really only one Faber?

07:05.967 --> 07:08.636
Speaking of jumping ship...

07:08.720 --> 07:10.847
could you stick around,
stay the night with us?

07:10.930 --> 07:13.933
I know you're exhausted, but...

07:14.017 --> 07:16.728
CBS wants
"The French Chef," Judith.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.439
Paul and I could use your mind
to talk it through.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.858
Wow.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.569
Okay.
O-of course I'll stay.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.446
We are live
in less than a minute!

07:26.529 --> 07:28.782
Anyone know who's missing
on the phones?

07:28.865 --> 07:31.076
- That empty seat looks bad.
- Avis, maybe.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.409
- Oh.
- Let me try calling.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.038
- Uh, Benny.
- Yeah, boss?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.664
We can shoot
with two cameras.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.957
Can you man the empty phone?

07:38.041 --> 07:42.087
Uh, I get kind of shy on
the phone, but I'll do my best.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.339
All right,
last looks, everyone!

07:44.422 --> 07:45.590
Whew.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.802
Now, these phones are about
to start ringing off the hook.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.514
Uh, remember
to smile, everyone.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.140
- Hunter?
- Yeah?

07:54.224 --> 07:55.558
- Places.
- Places.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.185
- Oh, yes.
- All right!

07:57.268 --> 08:00.897
We are ready in 5, 4, 3...

08:02.982 --> 08:07.445
Welcome to
the 10th annual WGBH Telethon,

08:07.529 --> 08:09.698
your chance
to support a station

08:09.781 --> 08:12.033
where there's
always something to learn.

08:12.117 --> 08:16.454
We're proud to bring you
the best of public television.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.331
- I want to show you the--
- Ugh.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.375
If this is the best
of public television,

08:20.457 --> 08:21.751
I'm going to starve.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.629
Behind me is
the famous tally board.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.715
We'll be checking
in periodically

08:26.798 --> 08:28.508
to see how we're doing.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.343
Let's hope we get
so many pledges,

08:30.427 --> 08:32.470
we run out of board.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.182
That's right.
Good.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.392
Where are you?

08:37.475 --> 08:40.145
I'm heading out the door to
register voters with Stanley.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.813
Oh, I assumed you'd be
here for the telethon.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.275
No.
Why would you assume that?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.736
Well, I don't know.
It's WGBH, and--

08:47.819 --> 08:50.739
- Stanley and I have plans.
- Oh, right.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.365
If Goldwater gets in,

08:52.449 --> 08:55.368
he'll start a nuclear war
with the Soviets.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.537
Oh, well, we can't have that.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.289
Tomorrow maybe.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.750
I'm going to be late.
I've got to go.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.969
Annuities can be
very attractive

09:13.053 --> 09:17.265
for people who want to invest
in a slow and steady way.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.560
Our audience must like
to do it slow and steady.

09:20.643 --> 09:24.147
The annuities episode
of "Economics for Laymen"

09:24.230 --> 09:26.775
was our most popular one ever,

09:26.858 --> 09:29.944
and we have it all queued up
to show you folks.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.406
But first,
we need you to invest

09:33.490 --> 09:35.325
in public TV.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.662
We'll roll tape
when the tally hits $20.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.415
I've got a call.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.794
Hello?

09:45.877 --> 09:47.337
Pepperoni?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.547
I think you got
the wrong number.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.219
How long
will the contract be for?

09:54.302 --> 09:56.054
I don't think
we've gotten that far.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.765
I can't hear you, Paul.
What are we doing here, anyway?

09:58.848 --> 10:01.309
We're...finding chicken.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.480
They haven't offered
many details.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.315
We're going out to LA
to have some meetings.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.150
We should make
a list of questions.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.777
How many episodes a year?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.654
Does Julia have
creative control?

10:12.737 --> 10:13.822
Mm-hmm.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.950
- Why are we finding a chicken?
- To feed the masses.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.662
We can nab the crudités
out there for roasted veggies.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.622
I was just about to ask you
for the house key

10:22.706 --> 10:24.249
so I could take a nap.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.002
Oh, come on, the old team.

10:27.085 --> 10:31.548
You complained about the food
yourself, baguette buddy.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.175
If you don't help me here,
people will starve--

10:34.259 --> 10:36.428
- or worse, eat.
- Ugh.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.182
What are you doing here?

10:41.266 --> 10:42.434
- Hello to you, too.
- Oh.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.935
Hmm.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.478
This is the worst
possible weekend.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.688
When did you get here?

10:46.771 --> 10:47.856
Look, I'd have called you,

10:47.939 --> 10:49.774
but you'd have
talked some sense into me.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.235
Hmm.
You brought a lot of clothes.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.903
How long are you
planning on staying?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.989
Oh, the suitcase is all
the work I have to do.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.282
My clothes are
in the briefcase.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.745
Oh, I have to be on set until
midnight tonight and tomorrow.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.538
- Uh--
- I only have Sunday.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.498
Only Sunday?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.292
- I do have half an hour.
- Mm.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.836
We're showing an episode
of "Economics for Laymen."

11:09.919 --> 11:12.297
- Oh, which episode?
- Hmm.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.178
Oh, for goodness' sake.

11:18.261 --> 11:22.307
No, no.
They need you on the phone!

11:33.777 --> 11:36.905
- How many have you registered?
- 15. You?

11:36.988 --> 11:39.199
- 19.
- 19!

11:39.282 --> 11:41.701
Winner gets to choose
their own prize.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.119
That's not a fair contest.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.538
I don't have your beauty
or social skills.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.999
You don't have my lungs.

11:48.083 --> 11:51.920
Adam Horowitz,
are you registered to vote?

11:52.003 --> 11:54.339
- Yes, Mrs. DeVoto.
- Oh.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.549
Well, good.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.967
Watch this.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.928
Hey, you boys!

12:00.011 --> 12:02.639
A word over here!

12:02.722 --> 12:04.724
Sorry.
I'm not interested in politics.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.476
Well, you better
get interested.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.353
If the U.S. doesn't get
out of Vietnam,

12:08.436 --> 12:09.688
we're looking at a draft.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.232
I'm interested in keeping
you boys in one piece.

12:12.315 --> 12:15.568
Look, the forms are over here.
You can fill them all out.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.903
Come on.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.448
Come on, fill them out.

12:20.532 --> 12:24.494
We'll split those--
17-21, so I'm still winning.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.375
We're back in 5, 4, 3...

12:30.458 --> 12:33.753
You can't say I oversold it.
That was fun.

12:33.837 --> 12:38.425
Um, now I'm here
with our very own Julia Child.

12:38.508 --> 12:42.220
- Enjoy the episode?
- Oh, I adore annuities.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.681
I flambé them
with a little Cognac.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.726
- Oh.
- I'm just joking.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.812
That's a recipe for ending up
in the poorhouse.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.983
- What's the tally up to, Hunter?
- $75.

12:55.066 --> 12:58.278
Oh, the poorhouse indeed.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.615
I'll tell you what...

13:02.699 --> 13:07.370
I will come to your house,
cook dinner for you--

13:07.454 --> 13:10.165
something scrumptious
with lots of butter--

13:10.248 --> 13:12.417
if you are the first person

13:12.500 --> 13:16.504
to pledge $100 right now.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.217
- Hello.
- I got a $100 pledge!

13:27.390 --> 13:29.225
- Alice?
- Hmm?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.019
Your mother's on the line.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.229
- Tell her I'm not here.
- I did.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.315
She said she saw you.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.860
Um, ah!

13:38.943 --> 13:41.821
Uh, Mom, this
isn't the best time.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.074
Why don't I answer
my home phone?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.659
Because I'm at work.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.453
Why am I not answering
my work phone?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.663
Because I'm answering
this phone, Mom.

13:50.747 --> 13:51.706
No.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.833
No, no, no.
Sunday I can't do.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.919
Because it's my one day off,
and I need--

13:56.002 --> 13:57.337
Well, maybe next week--

13:57.420 --> 14:00.674
Okay. Okay, I'm going to put
you down for a $50 pledge.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.759
Okay.
Love you, too. Bye.

14:05.470 --> 14:09.683
We hope you all enjoyed that
episode of "Museum Open House."

14:09.766 --> 14:12.477
It was so good my feet hurt.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.064
Um, I'm back here again
with Julia Child

14:16.147 --> 14:19.567
and apparently the Karate Cats.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.111
Meow!

14:21.194 --> 14:24.572
I had no idea
you two knew karate.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.450
Julia, can you make
scrambled eggs

14:27.534 --> 14:30.704
by shaking them
before you crack them?

14:30.787 --> 14:33.540
Well, of course not, Binky.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.710
You have to get the chicken
to hop up and down.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.965
And w-what's better
than scrambled eggs?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.508
Tuna fish.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.386
A home-cooked dinner,
right, Julia?

14:47.971 --> 14:51.307
- What's the tally, Hunter?
- Um...

14:51.391 --> 14:55.478
it's been $215
for quite some time.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.105
Oh.
All right.

14:57.188 --> 15:01.735
Well, next person
to pledge $100,

15:01.818 --> 15:04.112
I will cook you dinner.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.950
Ah, fantastic!

15:09.034 --> 15:11.119
What a sound.

15:11.202 --> 15:14.080
Julia Child
will be back again soon.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.916
Uh, Pinky, Poochy, we're about
to show an episode

15:17.000 --> 15:20.378
of "World Theater"
I think you'll enjoy.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.006
And we're out.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.677
No more dinners, Hunter.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.513
I won't have time
to make the show.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.558
It's chicken
with apples and thyme.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.768
And butter.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.770
This is like
a six-star restaurant.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.313
You mean five-star?

15:38.396 --> 15:39.856
I said six-star,
and I mean it.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.066
Okay.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.525
What a team we are.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.152
What happened to being tired?

15:44.235 --> 15:46.488
Trussing
the chicken revived me.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.698
And we've been discussing CBS.

15:48.782 --> 15:49.783
Shh.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.244
You see Julia
with the Karate Cats?

15:53.328 --> 15:55.747
- She's so funny.
- Yeah, she is--

15:55.830 --> 15:57.957
with everybody but me.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.627
I don't get that side of her.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.712
Is she always so...

16:02.796 --> 16:05.090
cordial with you?

16:05.173 --> 16:07.592
Honestly,
I was a little mean to her.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.220
I was the one
that needed winning over.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.389
Well, but I'm
at my wit's end.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.807
Just be yourself.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.517
Isn't that what you
tell everybody else?

16:22.691 --> 16:23.817
Yeah?

16:23.900 --> 16:27.320
You're on in three minutes--
final segment of the night.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.614
Uh, what's the board at?

16:29.698 --> 16:32.283
It's around $360, I think.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.334
Uh, Hunter, one thing
while I have you alone...

16:41.418 --> 16:43.169
Mm.

16:43.253 --> 16:47.924
Julia got a gift delivered
here today from CBS.

16:50.343 --> 16:54.055
Well, Julia's
got fans everywhere.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.725
I'm sure
it doesn't mean anything.

16:58.935 --> 17:02.605
Kick me when I'm down,
why don't you?

17:02.689 --> 17:05.942
There's only so much bad news
I can handle at once.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.074
It's been quite a year.

17:13.157 --> 17:17.619
And with viewers like you,
it's bound to be another.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.665
Uh, but it's not free,

17:21.750 --> 17:24.044
and that's why I'm back

17:24.127 --> 17:26.796
with my pockets inside out.

17:26.880 --> 17:31.176
I know we can get it
up to $500.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.886
Right, Boston?

17:32.969 --> 17:34.596
Go, Boston.

17:34.679 --> 17:35.889
Go, pledgers.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.265
Yeah.
Here we go.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.309
There's the number.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.186
There's your phone.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.520
Hello?

17:44.064 --> 17:46.066
People...

17:46.149 --> 17:49.110
you have to understand...

17:49.194 --> 17:51.488
public forums are like flowers.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.448
You--you have to care for them.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.284
Otherwise,
they'll wither and die.

17:56.368 --> 17:59.454
We're not CBS.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.122
Ah, all right.

18:01.206 --> 18:05.835
Uh, well, I think that's
quite enough, uh, for today.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.921
Um, tune in tomorrow

18:08.004 --> 18:10.882
for another prodigious evening.

18:10.965 --> 18:11.925
Thank you.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.385
And we're out.

18:13.468 --> 18:14.552
Thank God.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.515
All things considered,

18:18.598 --> 18:20.975
I think that was
a very successful evening.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.103
And we're on pace
for a new record.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.354
Oh.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.772
Good.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.524
- Yeah.
- Uh--um...

18:27.607 --> 18:29.526
Can we all chat for a bit?

18:29.609 --> 18:30.944
Sure, yeah.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.570
Alice had an idea
for tomorrow.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.072
Oh.
This wasn't my--

18:34.155 --> 18:35.532
And it was a great idea.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.992
She thought--
and I'm inclined to agree--

18:38.076 --> 18:40.161
we might shuffle things up.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.914
Let Julia try a few segments.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.542
Uh, how many segments?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.752
You...

18:47.836 --> 18:49.421
All of them?

18:51.172 --> 18:54.134
Are you firing me, Alice?

18:54.217 --> 18:56.136
Well, we just think

18:56.219 --> 18:59.180
that your talent
might be better used elsewhere.

18:59.264 --> 19:02.183
You're firing me.
That seems to be the trend.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.978
No one is getting fired.
Hosting isn't for everyone.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.731
- I found that out the hard way.
- No. Yes. Right.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.774
No, good idea.
Absolutely.

19:09.858 --> 19:14.571
Um, and if you need me,
I'll just be elsewhere.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.198
Oh.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.034
You'll be amazing, Julia.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.578
You get it intuitively.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.205
I have a request.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.582
You do a segment with me.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.542
Get the band back together.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.173
And Elaine can direct, huh?

19:33.256 --> 19:35.216
I want to watch her in action.

19:39.554 --> 19:42.932
The entire menu
was grand larceny,

19:43.016 --> 19:45.393
which somehow made it
even more delicious.

19:45.477 --> 19:46.978
Didn't it?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.398
Thinking of letting us

19:50.482 --> 19:52.484
into that hippocampus
of yours, darling?

19:52.567 --> 19:54.486
Oh, I don't know.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.739
Have we outgrown it?

19:57.822 --> 20:01.618
Well, there are arguments
for being a big fish, but...

20:01.701 --> 20:05.330
- WGBH may be too small a pond.
- It's a puddle.

20:05.413 --> 20:09.000
Just thinking about it
makes me wracked with guilt.

20:09.084 --> 20:11.503
And despite what
either of you say,

20:11.586 --> 20:14.422
I do feel I owe them something.

20:14.506 --> 20:17.467
Forward motion always leaves
a few things behind.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.720
Doesn't mean we should allow
inertia to settle in.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.307
No, I suppose not.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.188
I do wish you could stay
tomorrow, Judith.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.649
But my...

20:32.732 --> 20:36.444
brain is too scrambled
to make this kind of decision

20:36.528 --> 20:38.154
at this hour.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.325
Think of what we might do

20:42.409 --> 20:45.870
with real produce
and a bit of forethought.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.957
Care to cook with me again?

20:49.040 --> 20:51.459
- Hey, you okay?
- Not really.

20:51.543 --> 20:52.877
Well, come on.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.462
Look, Hunter's no Dick Clark,

20:54.546 --> 20:56.423
but you raised a lot of
money tonight.

20:56.506 --> 20:59.134
- Because of Julia.
- Nothing wrong with that.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.846
At least we have
a game plan for tomorrow.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.139
Mm.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.849
Going to be
cautiously optimistic.

21:05.932 --> 21:10.478
Optimistic enough that
a little bad news won't sting?

21:10.562 --> 21:13.690
I took a call in your office...

21:13.773 --> 21:16.943
from "The Tonight Show."

21:17.027 --> 21:18.820
They passed?

21:18.903 --> 21:21.489
Well, they said it just
isn't the right time.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.491
Oh, come on.
Of course they did.

21:23.575 --> 21:26.119
But that's not a no.
It'll happen soon.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.871
Not soon enough.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.123
None of this matters
if Julia leaves GBH,

21:30.206 --> 21:32.292
and she's got one foot
out the door.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.044
Hey, hey.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.504
Hey.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.506
Come here.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.925
This just isn't
the right time.

21:43.178 --> 21:45.513
You can't give me bad news

21:45.597 --> 21:47.724
and expect me
to be amorous, Isaac.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.226
Good to know.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.605
- Look at this.
- Looks marvelous.

21:53.688 --> 21:57.150
The secret is the béchamel.
You'll be asleep before noon.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.362
Bon appétit.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.615
I've been doing some thinking
about your offer,

22:03.698 --> 22:05.200
which is generous.

22:05.283 --> 22:06.826
I have a few requests.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.704
May we speak openly,
or should I slide you a note?

22:11.122 --> 22:14.709
The issue at WGBH is
we've been thinking too small.

22:14.793 --> 22:17.671
And so, in addition
to "The French Chef" series,

22:17.754 --> 22:21.383
I would like to shoot
a series of specials...

22:21.466 --> 22:22.884
in France.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.846
- Very smart.
- Not a problem.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.767
And as I said before,

22:30.850 --> 22:35.438
I'll need to bring my staff
with me, if they're willing...

22:35.522 --> 22:36.731
my entire staff.

22:36.815 --> 22:39.734
- Not a problem.
- Whatever you need, Julia.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.281
- Anything else?
- We're all ears.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.411
Okay, then.

22:57.585 --> 23:00.463
I've tried Avis
three times today.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.592
Do you think
she's avoiding my calls?

23:04.676 --> 23:07.053
Uh, I-I think she's out.

23:07.137 --> 23:09.014
Judith and I were disagreeing

23:09.097 --> 23:11.016
about how to update
a tuna salad.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.018
Any useful tips?

23:13.101 --> 23:14.894
Don't change the subject.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.063
Yeah.

23:17.147 --> 23:19.024
Ooh.

23:19.107 --> 23:22.027
Give her space, hmm?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.112
Clearly, that's what she wants.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.743
It's what you'd want,
if she'd hurt you.

23:32.787 --> 23:36.249
Seriously, though,
the literary implications alone

23:36.332 --> 23:38.668
are worth considering.

23:38.752 --> 23:40.420
Imagine how many books
we'd sell

23:40.503 --> 23:42.422
if her audience
increased tenfold.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.050
It is, uh, hard not to think
about that offer.

23:45.133 --> 23:48.178
Uh, don't you need
cinnamon sticks?

23:48.261 --> 23:50.055
I'm surprised you even know
what I'm making.

23:50.138 --> 23:53.433
I'm a diplomat.
I served in Ceylon.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.101
My palate is international.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.187
Care to make it interesting?

23:57.270 --> 23:59.439
What'd you have in mind?

23:59.522 --> 24:01.566
Well...

24:01.649 --> 24:03.985
want to have a contest?

24:06.738 --> 24:09.449
Oranges from CBS.

24:09.532 --> 24:13.870
Is there a scurvy outbreak
I'm not aware of?

24:13.953 --> 24:16.664
It's merely
a gesture, Hunter...

24:16.748 --> 24:18.416
all part of the dance.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.877
And I have two left feet.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.088
Oh, Hunter.

24:23.171 --> 24:27.467
I hope you're at least
considering staying.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.719
I-I know we don't have much
to offer.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.179
I'm no dummy.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.769
There's really nothing
I can say.

24:41.398 --> 24:44.192
But they don't need you.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.113
We need you.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.118
I-I don't want you
to stay as charity.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.912
That's not what I mean.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.164
I just don't want you to go.

25:02.043 --> 25:04.921
Please don't go.

25:05.005 --> 25:08.341
Ready, Julia?
We need our host.

25:14.431 --> 25:15.724
Help yourself.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.934
Uh, mm.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.894
This. Ah.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.104
Well, have a bite.

25:25.442 --> 25:26.735
Oh. Mm.

25:26.818 --> 25:28.778
Russ, I spent
all day yesterday talking

25:28.862 --> 25:32.323
- to the staff about you.
- Mm?

25:32.407 --> 25:34.826
WGBH has had
one good idea in years.

25:34.909 --> 25:35.827
Oh.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.621
And it was yours.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.960
"There's a guilelessness
about Julia

25:44.044 --> 25:45.754
"the camera just eats up.

25:45.837 --> 25:49.007
She can't help but delight us."

25:49.090 --> 25:51.551
Hal, you have to understand,
that article--

25:51.634 --> 25:54.429
Now, don't--
don't be modest, Russ.

25:54.512 --> 25:57.474
You're the man who saw
what no one else could see.

26:00.643 --> 26:03.188
I want that man.

26:03.271 --> 26:07.984
I want that man
to take the helm of WGBH.

26:09.402 --> 26:10.862
A little dry.

26:12.655 --> 26:15.784
Oh, Russ, enjoy it.
I am incredibly proud of you.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.827
For being
a duplicitous villain?

26:17.911 --> 26:19.662
That's a tad hyperbolic,
don't you think?

26:19.746 --> 26:20.872
Shh! Whoa!

26:20.955 --> 26:22.832
Keep your voice down.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.417
Why?
You should be celebrating.

26:24.501 --> 26:25.835
I should be atoning.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.754
How can I take
a job based on a lie?

26:27.837 --> 26:29.464
You didn't technically lie.

26:29.547 --> 26:32.050
You just went along with
someone else's half-truth.

26:32.133 --> 26:33.009
What?

26:33.093 --> 26:34.427
How--how can I take credit

26:34.511 --> 26:36.596
for something
I actively campaigned against?

26:36.680 --> 26:38.014
How can I do it again, Marian,

26:38.098 --> 26:41.059
when I never did it
in the first place?

26:44.145 --> 26:46.815
Bonsoir, mes amis,

26:46.898 --> 26:49.025
and welcome back.

26:49.109 --> 26:51.486
We've decided
to shake things up,

26:51.569 --> 26:54.406
not unlike
a homespun vinaigrette.

26:54.489 --> 26:58.868
Tonight, ladies and germs,
I shall be your hostess,

26:58.952 --> 27:00.620
and I want to hear
those phones ringing

27:00.704 --> 27:03.248
like the bells of Notre Dame.

27:03.331 --> 27:06.251
Do you know what? I think
I'll take a few calls myself.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.879
Now, that's more like it.

27:09.963 --> 27:14.259
Let's put our phone team
to work, including...

27:14.342 --> 27:17.262
- May I, Helen?
- Oh, yes.

27:17.345 --> 27:22.017
This very handsome gentleman.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.477
Now, where were you yesterday

27:24.561 --> 27:26.980
when the rest of us
were working, Albert?

27:27.063 --> 27:28.189
Teaching a class.

27:28.273 --> 27:31.860
Well, I'm still
marking you absent.

27:31.943 --> 27:34.112
May I borrow this?

27:36.364 --> 27:38.908
This is Julia Child.

27:38.992 --> 27:40.368
Oh, my goodness!

27:40.452 --> 27:41.870
Is that really you?

27:41.953 --> 27:43.997
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.083
How much can you spare, dearie?

27:47.167 --> 27:50.295
Well, if you could indulge
a bit more,

27:50.378 --> 27:53.506
why, I'll name
a recipe after you--

27:53.590 --> 27:55.342
the Bertie Bombe.

27:55.425 --> 27:58.178
It feels like
a classic already.

27:58.261 --> 27:59.554
Oh!

27:59.637 --> 28:02.390
Is that lipstick
on your collar, Albert?

28:03.350 --> 28:05.769
Bless you, Bertie.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.521
Well, keep them coming, Boston.

28:08.605 --> 28:10.690
We're really cooking now.

28:10.774 --> 28:12.942
She's better than I am,
isn't she?

28:13.026 --> 28:15.236
- Up next, our very own...
- So much better.

28:18.156 --> 28:20.325
Listen, I want you
to hear it from me first.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.743
Hmm?

28:21.826 --> 28:24.329
Hal offered me your job.

28:24.412 --> 28:25.705
They say they want

28:25.789 --> 28:28.333
the man responsible
for "The French Chef,"

28:28.416 --> 28:30.043
which is you.

28:30.126 --> 28:33.213
You saw something in Julia
none of us could.

28:33.296 --> 28:36.341
I told Hal you're the man
for the job.

28:36.424 --> 28:38.093
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:38.176 --> 28:40.136
Thank you, Russ.

28:40.220 --> 28:42.347
Thank you so much.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.224
He didn't care.

28:47.644 --> 28:49.104
Right.

28:51.314 --> 28:53.942
Those audience numbers
they gave you were surreal.

28:54.025 --> 28:56.653
I know.
It's a lot of eyeballs.

28:58.196 --> 29:00.782
Uh, not talking about
the sausage--it's eyeball free.

29:00.865 --> 29:01.950
What is this?

29:02.033 --> 29:03.618
That is your secret
ingredient--

29:03.702 --> 29:05.245
maraschino cherries.

29:05.328 --> 29:06.371
What am I supposed to do

29:06.454 --> 29:08.164
with a cocktail garnish
for lightweights?

29:08.248 --> 29:09.916
That's up to
you to figure out.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.209
Touché.

29:11.292 --> 29:14.504
But you'll have your hands full
with this.

29:16.840 --> 29:17.799
What is that?

29:17.882 --> 29:19.342
You never seen
a Twinkie before?

29:19.426 --> 29:20.927
Never.

29:21.011 --> 29:24.597
A chef is only as good
as their last plate.

29:24.681 --> 29:27.267
Bonne chance.

29:27.350 --> 29:30.186
"And he bigan
with right a myrie cheere.

29:30.270 --> 29:33.773
His tale anon,
and seyde as ye may heere."

29:33.857 --> 29:38.153
And as this is my final
telethon here at WGBH,

29:38.236 --> 29:42.032
that will mark my last time
reciting all 858 lines

29:42.115 --> 29:44.659
of the prologue to Chaucer's
"Canterbury Tales"

29:44.743 --> 29:47.203
from memory for all of you.

29:47.287 --> 29:48.663
Thank you.

29:48.747 --> 29:51.374
And now,
before I get too maudlin,

29:51.458 --> 29:53.918
I am enthralled
to be joined once again

29:54.002 --> 29:55.545
by the incomparable,

29:55.628 --> 29:58.214
and now
National Book Award-winning,

29:58.298 --> 30:00.216
John Updike.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.093
Honored to be
of service, Duke.

30:02.177 --> 30:03.219
How gallant.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.846
And the viewers will go mad

30:04.929 --> 30:07.015
when you help me introduce
their favorite episode

30:07.098 --> 30:09.809
- of "I've Been Reading."
- I do love our episode so.

30:09.893 --> 30:12.062
One of the great surprises
of my year.

30:12.145 --> 30:13.480
Oh, me too, and it was,

30:13.563 --> 30:15.231
but I meant the one
with Julia Child.

30:15.315 --> 30:16.483
Oh.

30:16.566 --> 30:18.818
Well, in her defense,
Johnny, she cooks.

30:18.902 --> 30:20.612
Maybe I could work
the phones.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.655
I've been told
I have a lovely voice.

30:22.739 --> 30:25.325
- I'm sure you do not.
- I've even been known to sing.

30:25.408 --> 30:27.410
I don't think
the audience would--

30:27.494 --> 30:30.038
I am the very model
of a modern major-general

30:30.121 --> 30:31.414
There he goes.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.291
I've information vegetable,
animal, and mineral

30:33.375 --> 30:34.668
I know the kings of England

30:34.751 --> 30:36.419
And I quote
the fights historical

30:36.503 --> 30:39.464
From Marathon to Waterloo,
in order categorical

30:39.547 --> 30:41.675
Not bad for an amateur.

30:41.758 --> 30:43.635
The secret, though,
lies in the breath placement.

30:43.718 --> 30:45.845
I can tell
undoubted Raphaels

30:45.929 --> 30:47.681
From Gerard Dows
and Zoffanies

30:47.764 --> 30:50.058
I know the croaking chorus of
"The Frogs" from Aristophanes

30:50.141 --> 30:51.476
Then I can hum a fugue

30:51.559 --> 30:53.603
Of which I've heard
the music's din afore

30:53.687 --> 30:55.188
And whistle all the airs

30:55.271 --> 30:56.731
From that infernal nonsense
"Pinafore"

30:56.815 --> 30:58.066
In short, in matters

30:58.149 --> 30:59.901
Vegetable, animal,
and mineral

30:59.984 --> 31:02.987
I am the very model
of a modern major-general

31:03.071 --> 31:04.864
Bravo, bravo.

31:04.948 --> 31:06.408
- Thank you, sir.
- Well done, indeed.

31:07.283 --> 31:09.869
- Hello, WGBH.
- Hello?

31:09.953 --> 31:12.288
- Alice.
- Tell my mother I'm dead.

31:12.372 --> 31:14.416
No, it's somebody claiming
to be from the White House.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.586
Put it through to my office.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.384
Oh.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.094
- Ah!
- Oh, excuse me.

31:26.177 --> 31:27.721
- Whoa.
- Hey, hey.

31:27.804 --> 31:29.472
- Hey!
- Thank you.

31:29.556 --> 31:31.516
- Whoa.
- Uh, no.

31:37.981 --> 31:39.482
This is Alice.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.278
Julia?

31:43.361 --> 31:46.072
I know. I know. The editing
suite--I'll be right there.

31:46.156 --> 31:47.907
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not that.

31:47.991 --> 31:49.325
It's not only that.

31:51.745 --> 31:54.622
- Can you keep a secret?
- Historically, no.

31:54.706 --> 31:57.751
What you're smelling
is a dhansak curry

31:57.834 --> 32:00.170
with a maraschino-cherry
chutney.

32:00.253 --> 32:03.340
I actually think the ginger
and cherries

32:03.423 --> 32:06.843
pair perfectly
with the warm, toasted spices.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.845
- And what are these?
- I'm glad you asked.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.890
I took a pure pork sausage
that I made myself,

32:11.973 --> 32:13.141
and I've nestled it

32:13.224 --> 32:15.727
inside America's favorite
snacking cake.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.729
Whoa.
What do you call them?

32:17.812 --> 32:21.358
Um, "chartwinkeries."

32:21.441 --> 32:22.942
Oh, my--

32:23.026 --> 32:24.569
This is delicious.

32:24.652 --> 32:26.363
When I talked
to you yesterday,

32:26.446 --> 32:28.948
you sounded like you
were ready to murder someone.

32:29.032 --> 32:31.451
Look at you now--
chef de cuisine.

32:31.534 --> 32:35.163
This place is strange
and special, isn't it?

32:35.246 --> 32:36.581
It would have to be,

32:36.664 --> 32:38.667
to have one of the sharpest
minds in publishing

32:38.750 --> 32:41.586
cooking for the crew.

32:41.670 --> 32:44.506
We're live in one minute.
Let's just mark it for Benny.

32:44.589 --> 32:48.843
Oh, really, Elaine,
can't we just do it?

32:48.927 --> 32:50.637
I'm fine.
I'm in good hands.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.764
I just hope
this won't be like the time

32:52.847 --> 32:54.182
I tried to sauté onions

32:54.265 --> 32:56.351
and they landed
on poor Avis's head.

32:58.728 --> 33:00.939
Avis and onions.

33:01.022 --> 33:05.902
Okay.
We are live in 5, 4, 3...

33:07.654 --> 33:08.947
Welcome back.

33:09.030 --> 33:12.283
I'm telethon director Morash--
Russell Morash.

33:12.367 --> 33:16.413
Julia Child is a great many
things here at WGBH--

33:16.496 --> 33:20.583
chef, host, and friend.

33:20.667 --> 33:24.629
She's also an expert
at the remarkable medium

33:24.713 --> 33:26.881
of editing.

33:26.965 --> 33:30.010
Tell me, Julia...

33:30.093 --> 33:32.762
what exactly is videotape?

33:32.846 --> 33:35.890
Well, Russ, many people
are intimidated,

33:35.974 --> 33:38.184
but videotape is very simple.

33:38.268 --> 33:42.063
It's brown and shiny.

33:42.147 --> 33:43.857
It looks an awful lot
like chocolate.

33:43.940 --> 33:45.150
- Mm.
- Mm.

33:46.359 --> 33:48.528
- Awfully slippery.
- Fascinating.

33:48.611 --> 33:52.032
I'm going to splice
two pieces of tape together.

33:52.115 --> 33:54.159
Wow.
H-how do you do that?

33:54.242 --> 33:56.494
Oh, it's just
a bit of sticky tape.

33:56.578 --> 33:59.247
Could you hold
that down for me?

33:59.330 --> 34:00.623
Thank you.

34:02.083 --> 34:05.879
And then we just...

34:05.962 --> 34:07.630
cut the edges off.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.466
Incredible.

34:09.549 --> 34:11.509
A real master.

34:14.012 --> 34:16.348
Now, just say
a prayer for your fingers,

34:16.431 --> 34:17.556
and I'll--

34:17.639 --> 34:20.768
I have do it
with my eyes closed.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.690
Johnny Carson said no--

34:26.775 --> 34:28.485
or not yet,
but we know what that means.

34:28.568 --> 34:29.944
Doesn't it mean "not yet"?

34:30.027 --> 34:31.154
And then
the White House called.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.697
- The White House?
- Think about it.

34:32.781 --> 34:34.866
What is the most important meal
in this country?

34:34.949 --> 34:36.451
Uh, breakfast.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.036
- State dinners, Russ.
- Ah.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.996
Julia is going to take
WGBH behind the scenes

34:41.081 --> 34:42.456
into the White House kitchen--

34:42.540 --> 34:43.750
first time anyone's
ever filmed there.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.460
Wow.
Alice, that's huge.

34:45.543 --> 34:47.295
And I want you to direct.

34:47.379 --> 34:49.672
What?
Really?

34:49.755 --> 34:51.507
What about Elaine?

34:51.591 --> 34:54.386
You were Julia's director.
You're the one to do this.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.394
Take as many as you like.

35:09.025 --> 35:11.736
"Your friends at CBS."

35:11.820 --> 35:12.946
Zowie.

35:13.029 --> 35:15.740
Yes, they want me
to come to LA.

35:15.824 --> 35:19.119
It is rather confusing.

35:19.202 --> 35:20.537
You got any advice

35:20.620 --> 35:23.331
for an old girl
navigating the West Coast?

35:23.415 --> 35:25.125
Well...

35:25.208 --> 35:28.169
it usually goes one
of two ways.

35:28.253 --> 35:31.756
If you're a hit,
then you grow--

35:31.840 --> 35:35.135
not just your audience,
but you, your power,

35:35.218 --> 35:37.345
and you feel it,
and it feels good,

35:37.429 --> 35:39.764
and it feels permanent.

35:39.848 --> 35:41.766
But that's a trap...

35:41.850 --> 35:44.394
because nothing in LA
is ever permanent.

35:44.477 --> 35:46.688
And the alternative?

35:46.771 --> 35:48.064
You miss.

35:48.148 --> 35:49.774
And even a near-miss,

35:49.858 --> 35:52.569
you'll be back here with
your tail between your legs,

35:52.652 --> 35:55.113
begging for your old job back.

35:55.196 --> 35:56.573
Well, I guess I was right

35:56.656 --> 36:00.535
to assume there were strings
attached to all that sunshine.

36:00.618 --> 36:02.579
Yeah, well, there are
strings everywhere,

36:02.662 --> 36:03.955
even where it rains.

36:07.459 --> 36:10.420
I wish we'd gotten off
to a better start, you and I.

36:11.671 --> 36:13.965
I beg your pardon?

36:14.049 --> 36:16.926
I don't need everyone
to like me--I really don't.

36:17.010 --> 36:21.014
But you never even
gave me a chance.

36:21.097 --> 36:23.099
I think
you've misread me, Elaine.

36:23.183 --> 36:25.810
No, I don't think I have.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.604
I'm a lot of things, Julia,

36:27.687 --> 36:30.065
but one thing I know
is I'm good at my job.

36:30.148 --> 36:31.691
Oh, I have no doubt.

36:31.775 --> 36:33.818
You know, I've come
across your type before.

36:33.902 --> 36:36.279
Yeah, you're one of those women
who doesn't like other women

36:36.363 --> 36:38.740
telling them what to do.

36:38.823 --> 36:41.826
But I promise you...

36:41.910 --> 36:44.245
there is room for both of us.

36:51.753 --> 36:55.882
Well, it's been an
illuminating couple of nights.

36:55.965 --> 36:57.217
Thank you all for being--

36:57.300 --> 36:59.427
Fuel for the resistance.

36:59.511 --> 37:01.179
My hand is cramping.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.639
Thank you.

37:02.722 --> 37:04.974
That must be why you've made
so many spelling mistakes.

37:05.058 --> 37:06.518
Ah.

37:06.601 --> 37:08.144
This is my tenth poster,

37:08.228 --> 37:10.855
and I'm distracted by that
program you insist we watch.

37:10.939 --> 37:12.482
- They're your friends.
- Mm.

37:12.565 --> 37:14.317
Besides, they put on
quite a show.

37:14.401 --> 37:16.444
Like Alice Naman.

37:16.528 --> 37:18.405
If you ever see the show
outside of Boston,

37:18.488 --> 37:21.074
- chances are she's to blame.
- Call her.

37:21.157 --> 37:24.244
It'll make you
both feel better.

37:24.327 --> 37:26.162
No.

37:26.246 --> 37:29.082
My, uh, constant companion
behind the camera,

37:29.165 --> 37:30.875
and sometimes even
in front of it.

37:30.959 --> 37:32.877
How do you spell
Massachusetts?

37:32.961 --> 37:34.671
I've been able to take
my food journey

37:34.754 --> 37:36.131
and share it with all of you,

37:36.214 --> 37:40.343
from France to Boston
to who-knows-where.

37:40.427 --> 37:42.095
$50!

37:42.178 --> 37:44.806
We have money flowing
from all directions.

37:44.889 --> 37:47.100
What a perfect way to close.

37:47.183 --> 37:48.768
Even if we didn't hit

37:48.852 --> 37:51.771
the scintillating magnitude
of $2,500,

37:51.855 --> 37:54.315
we still made scads more money
than ever before.

37:54.399 --> 37:56.109
So what's more--

37:56.192 --> 37:57.527
What?

37:57.610 --> 37:59.112
- Julia.
- Oh.

37:59.195 --> 38:03.324
Oh, I guess we still got
a few moments left.

38:05.577 --> 38:08.747
If you'll forgive me, it has
been a very, very long night,

38:08.830 --> 38:12.083
and my feet, frankly,
are killing me.

38:12.167 --> 38:16.921
But, you know,
we truly have had...

38:17.005 --> 38:20.717
so much fun singing
for our supper this evening.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.510
But the truth is,

38:22.594 --> 38:27.265
WGBH is a very different kind
of network.

38:27.349 --> 38:29.017
The people you see
aren't actors.

38:29.100 --> 38:32.187
They're teachers, teachers
with something to share

38:32.270 --> 38:34.856
and a passion for sharing it.

38:34.939 --> 38:39.694
What other network would take
a chance on a woman like me?

38:39.778 --> 38:43.740
Where else could I learn
and grow and fail

38:43.823 --> 38:47.952
and just be myself
in front of the camera?

38:48.036 --> 38:50.538
We all owe a debt of gratitude

38:50.622 --> 38:53.750
to the leadership
of Hunter Fox...

38:56.836 --> 39:00.173
Perhaps me more so than anyone.

39:00.256 --> 39:02.550
It takes a certain
kind of captain

39:02.634 --> 39:06.554
to keep
this ramshackle ship afloat.

39:06.638 --> 39:10.558
He's got taste and vision...

39:10.642 --> 39:13.561
and integrity, to boot.

39:13.645 --> 39:16.356
And I couldn't imagine
working for anyone else.

39:16.439 --> 39:18.566
In fact, I don't think I could.

39:21.027 --> 39:23.988
No, this place
is one of a kind.

39:24.072 --> 39:25.990
He brought me to the party,

39:26.074 --> 39:29.369
and now it's my one and only,
my home.

39:31.413 --> 39:33.957
And maybe there are
grander homes out there,

39:34.040 --> 39:35.959
but home is home,

39:36.042 --> 39:39.045
and there's nowhere else
I would rather be.

39:41.089 --> 39:44.217
So mark your calendars.

39:44.300 --> 39:48.805
I'll be back right here
for next year's telethon,

39:48.888 --> 39:51.808
and I hope you'll join me.

39:53.893 --> 39:55.979
Hello?
Yes.

39:56.062 --> 39:57.397
Great.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.358
We just received a donation
for $300.

40:02.110 --> 40:05.363
That is
a very nice number, indeed.

40:05.447 --> 40:09.617
So, from all of us
here at WGBH,

40:09.701 --> 40:13.121
good night, Boston,
and thank you.

40:13.204 --> 40:14.873
Bon appétit.

40:18.710 --> 40:21.838
You just pledged $300

40:21.921 --> 40:24.049
on a professor's salary?

40:24.132 --> 40:26.217
I was moved to act.

40:26.301 --> 40:29.262
Isn't that what we ask
our voters to do?

40:30.722 --> 40:34.351
You don't even teach
in the business school.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.603
You're a scientist,
for heaven's sake.

40:36.686 --> 40:38.855
- Ah, it's family money.
- Oh.

40:38.938 --> 40:40.565
I never know
what to do with it.

40:40.648 --> 40:42.650
Oh.

40:44.652 --> 40:46.946
And they're your friends.

40:52.077 --> 40:53.078
Hmm.

40:53.161 --> 40:55.663
What'd you think of the show?

40:55.747 --> 40:58.792
Oh, it came together
in the end.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.877
And the White House
is going to be even better.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.671
Oh, isn't it crazy?

41:02.754 --> 41:05.882
Yeah, Russ will kill it...

41:05.965 --> 41:08.760
at least that's the rumor.

41:11.513 --> 41:14.391
That's not how I wanted you
to find out.

41:14.474 --> 41:18.103
- Julia has a history with Russ--
- No, I get it.

41:18.186 --> 41:19.896
So...

41:19.979 --> 41:23.400
should I assume there
are wider implications?

41:25.985 --> 41:28.196
Well, you two,
you just haven't--

41:31.074 --> 41:34.160
I have to do what's best
for Julia and for the show.

41:34.244 --> 41:36.454
Yeah, of course you do.

41:36.538 --> 41:38.498
For what it's worth,

41:38.581 --> 41:41.918
I do feel like I am losing
the only person on my side.

41:52.387 --> 41:54.347
Just don't stay
here too long.

42:03.064 --> 42:07.318
It just wasn't the same
without you by my side--

42:07.402 --> 42:09.863
or under my skirt.

42:09.946 --> 42:12.157
Well, I couldn't stay
away long.

42:12.240 --> 42:15.076
Besides, Stanley won't stop
talking about Paul.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.078
- Hmm?
- He keeps asking me if I know

42:17.162 --> 42:19.414
where he got
his turquoise ring.

42:19.497 --> 42:23.543
Oh, Stanley,
patron saint of WGBH.

42:23.626 --> 42:24.961
Mm.

42:25.045 --> 42:27.172
And once I finish cooking
dinner for half of Boston,

42:27.255 --> 42:29.674
I'll bake him a hell of a cake.

42:29.758 --> 42:31.926
He's picky about pastry, too.

42:32.010 --> 42:33.970
I'll make sure
the cake and the frosting

42:34.054 --> 42:36.056
don't touch each other.

42:38.516 --> 42:41.353
I'm sorry I was distant.

42:41.436 --> 42:43.772
No, I'm sorry.

42:43.855 --> 42:45.690
Young love needs
room to blossom.

42:45.774 --> 42:49.069
Oh.
Young love.

42:49.152 --> 42:51.196
But I will need you
at the White House with me.

42:51.279 --> 42:53.323
And for that, I won't take no
for an answer.

42:53.406 --> 42:54.532
Aye, aye, Captain.

42:54.616 --> 42:57.202
I'd love to have
a chat with LBJ.

42:57.285 --> 42:59.579
- Who else is going?
- Oh, it's the whole team.

42:59.662 --> 43:02.707
It's you, Alice, Russ.

43:02.791 --> 43:04.334
Russ?

43:06.252 --> 43:08.797
Elaine is no longer
with us, I'm afraid.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.048
Oh.

43:10.131 --> 43:13.426
Couldn't find common ground.

43:13.510 --> 43:14.803
Maybe she's right.

43:14.886 --> 43:18.348
Maybe I do prefer
being directed by men.

43:18.431 --> 43:20.934
Well, we'll just have
to agree to disagree

43:21.017 --> 43:23.186
about certain things...

43:23.269 --> 43:25.438
like that.

43:25.522 --> 43:27.816
Let's not forget these.

43:27.899 --> 43:30.110
I'm a vigorous card player,
and I get parched.

43:30.193 --> 43:32.612
Finally, we have a foursome.

43:36.658 --> 43:38.034
Oh, thank you, Stanley.

43:41.538 --> 43:42.831
Fortification.

43:46.167 --> 43:47.460
Everyone ready?

43:47.544 --> 43:49.087
- Who dealt?
- I did.
