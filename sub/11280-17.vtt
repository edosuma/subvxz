CHRIS ROCK:
As a kid,
I loved listening to music.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.209
I loved soul.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.543
I loved rock.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.379
And even the occasional polka.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.381
* Got to, got to pay back

00:13.414 --> 00:15.149
But my favorite was hip-hop.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.584
* Revenge

00:27.495 --> 00:32.400
Rappers are the big stars now,
but back then, it was the DJs.

00:32.433 --> 00:35.203
DJ Jazzy Jeff actually had top
billing over the Fresh Prince.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.139
While the DJs did
all the hard work,

00:38.172 --> 00:40.574
all the rappers did
was say one thing.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.110
Say "Hey!"

00:42.143 --> 00:43.211
ALL:
Hey!

00:43.244 --> 00:44.545
Say "Oh!"

00:44.578 --> 00:45.513
Oh!

00:45.546 --> 00:47.148
Now scream!

00:48.582 --> 00:51.085
He went on to join Public Enemy
as one of the guys

00:51.119 --> 00:53.421
who looked tough
but was never allowed to rap.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.856
We have a warrant for the
arrest of Hilton Reed

00:55.889 --> 00:59.493
aka DJ Hilly Hill.
(needle slides off record,
music stops)

00:59.527 --> 01:00.794
The first rule
of breaking the law:

01:00.828 --> 01:01.862
If the cops are after you,

01:01.895 --> 01:04.732
don't stand under a sign
with your name on it.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.302
Yo, yo, why y'all
arresting me, Jack?

01:08.336 --> 01:09.870
I pay my bills just
like everybody else.
Yeah, yeah.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.205
Cry me a river.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.440
Yo, I didn't even
have nothing to do

01:12.473 --> 01:14.208
with that Alpine in
that Cadillac, either.

01:14.242 --> 01:17.411
Yo, take care of
my records, son.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.546
We'll see you
later, Jerome.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.281
Yo, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.782
Y'all, y'all don't
have to leave.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.584
I know somebody here
knows how

01:23.617 --> 01:24.885
to DJ.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.254
I know how to DJ.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.622
Little dude from
across the street.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.891
You're telling me you know how
to rock the wheels of steel?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.660
Yeah.
Well, go ahead, then.

01:32.693 --> 01:33.827
Turn the party out.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.464
Hold on,
everybody, hold on.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.498
Let me hold a dollar.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.667
He's charging me to help him?

01:43.371 --> 01:46.207
If you're telling the
truth, I'll give it back.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.275
Thanks.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.187
Oh!

01:59.220 --> 02:01.655
RAPPER:
Say "Go, little dude!"

02:01.689 --> 02:02.656
ALL:
Go, little dude!

02:02.690 --> 02:04.225
"Go, little dude!"

02:04.258 --> 02:05.259
Go, little dude!

02:05.293 --> 02:06.394
Say "Hey!"

02:06.427 --> 02:07.428
Hey!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.563
Say "Oh!"
Ho!

02:09.597 --> 02:10.731
Now scream!

02:11.932 --> 02:13.701
JEROME:
Listen up.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.703
I'm doing another party
next Saturday.

02:15.736 --> 02:16.637
You want to DJ?

02:16.670 --> 02:18.239
It pays a hundred dollars.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.773
A hundred dollars?
Yeah.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.242
Cool.

02:21.275 --> 02:24.878
Notice he didn't give me
my dollar back.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.781
Hip-hop was the biggest thing
to hit Bed-Stuy since poverty,

03:00.814 --> 03:03.451
but it took a little longer to
get to the white neighborhoods.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.719
Hey, Chris, where are you
going in such a hurry?

03:05.753 --> 03:07.621
Oh, I need to go buy
turntables.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.491
I got a job offer
DJing a party.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.492
DJ?

03:11.525 --> 03:12.626
You mean like
Wolfman Jack?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.728
No, like Grandmaster Flash.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.764
Grandmaster Flash.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.332
Isn't he in the
Justice League?

03:18.366 --> 03:20.801
No, the Furious Five.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.236
Those look expensive.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.671
Well, they're professional.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.905
Yeah, but you're not.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.440
Greg's future career

03:26.474 --> 03:28.909
as a motivational speaker
didn't go very well.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.245
Man, this is so cool.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.680
White guys have to learn
to play instruments

03:32.713 --> 03:33.547
to make records.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.516
Black guys just have
to play the records.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.385
But the white man still
gets all the money.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.519
What are you going
to call yourself?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.454
DJ Chrissy Chris.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.356
Isn't Chrissy a girl's name?

03:42.390 --> 03:43.591
It's a black thing.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.527
Like that badass black dude
from Three's Company.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.662
While I was dreaming
of being a cut creator,

03:48.696 --> 03:51.299
Drew was dreaming
of being a prestidigitator.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.700
Hi, I'm Marshall Brodien.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.769
Most magic tricks are easy
once you know the secret.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.739
For example, have someone take
a card like the six of hearts.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.375
Tear it up into small pieces.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.611
Have someone hold
one of the pieces.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.812
Place the others inside the box.

04:04.845 --> 04:07.981
Close the box,
tap it with a magic wand.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.517
When you open the box,

04:09.550 --> 04:10.751
the card is back in one piece

04:10.784 --> 04:12.886
and the piece they're holding
fits perfectly.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.322
Take an ordinary piece
of newspaper...

04:14.355 --> 04:16.390
Oh, what's that?

04:16.424 --> 04:17.458
Marshall Brodien.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.859
He's my favorite magician.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.694
Oh.
Hey, Mom.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.364
Could you take me
to the toy store this week?
What for?

04:23.397 --> 04:25.733
They're having free magic shows
with Magician the Magician.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.369
That's as lazy as me calling
myself Comedian the Comedian.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.405
And the first 25 people
to get there get a free deck

04:31.439 --> 04:33.474
of Marshall Brodien's
TV Magic Cards.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.309
Oh, baby, I can't take you,
I got to work.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.345
But when your father wakes up,
why don't you ask him?

04:37.378 --> 04:39.012
Maybe he could take you.
Okay.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.549
Now, wait a minute, Drew.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.851
I don't want you fooling
around with no black magic.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.853
You hear me? I don't want
to come home and see

04:45.886 --> 04:48.489
no pentagrams and dead goats and
chickens and stuff like that.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.058
Only good, clean white magic.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.593
You hear me?

04:52.626 --> 04:55.429
Why not compromise
and do Puerto Rican magic?

04:55.463 --> 04:56.530
Yes, ma'am.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.899
Magician, huh?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.568
My mother didn't
care about magic.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.704
She just imagined how it
could make her look good.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.005
My boy is a
football player.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.774
He just got a
scholarship to Rutgers.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.841
My daughter is a doctor.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.411
She just finished her
first open-heart surgery.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.979
And my son is a magician.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.814
And he just made
Bed-Stuy disappear.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.916
Ooh.

05:15.949 --> 05:19.052
You better tell him to bring it
back 'cause I'm closing at 9:00.

05:23.891 --> 05:24.792
Mama,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.927
Drew made my barrette disappear.

05:26.960 --> 05:31.365
Drew, give your sister
her barrette back.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.400
All right.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.808
Damn, he is good.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.815
She's making sure
he didn't take her ears.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.751
Finding a pair of turntables
was harder than I thought,

05:50.784 --> 05:51.652
because as it turns out,

05:51.685 --> 05:54.555
I wasn't the only DJ
who wanted them.

05:54.588 --> 05:59.660
Sorry, kid, Jam Master Jay
just bought the last pair.

05:59.693 --> 06:04.965
Sorry, kid, DJ Scott LaRock
just bought the last pair.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.735
Well, I'm sorry, uh,
we just sold the last pair

06:07.768 --> 06:10.103
to this kid who called
himself Funkmaster Flex.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.972
Funkmaster Flex?

06:12.005 --> 06:12.973
Same thing I said.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.942
Sounds like some kind
of workout machine to me.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.478
Yeah, for out-of-shape
funky people.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.712
Not gonna have any more in

06:18.746 --> 06:19.880
for at least
another eight weeks.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.915
But I need turntables
by Saturday.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.117
Let me show you
something.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.754
You got a big party
going on or something?
Yeah.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.956
How about these?

06:28.989 --> 06:30.558
That's all you got?

06:30.591 --> 06:32.159
I can only imagine
what kind of people

06:32.192 --> 06:33.861
would come to that party.

06:33.894 --> 06:38.098
(James Brown's "The Payback"
playing)

06:40.133 --> 06:41.935
* The big payback

06:41.969 --> 06:43.871
Say "Hey!"

06:43.904 --> 06:45.138
Hey.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.206
Say "Ho!"

06:46.239 --> 06:47.675
Ho.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.976
Now scream!

06:49.009 --> 06:51.612
Aah!

06:51.645 --> 06:54.014
That's not what they mean
by old school.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.787
While I was pursuing hip-hop,

06:59.820 --> 07:02.656
my dad was trying to avoid
things that went hippity hop.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.525
Hey, Dad, do you think
you could take me

07:04.558 --> 07:05.759
to the magic show this week?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.661
I got a magic show for you.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.096
I work two jobs
seven days a week,

07:09.129 --> 07:10.964
and every day,
my money disappears.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.199
How's that for magic?

07:12.232 --> 07:14.702
But I want to get a
set of TV Magic Cards.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.604
You gonna make some money
with this magic?

07:16.637 --> 07:18.906
If he gets good, he could make
your "broke" disappear.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.074
I don't know,
but Doug Henning does.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.844
What you going to do
at this show?

07:23.877 --> 07:25.879
Everything.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.215
Card tricks, sawing
people in half,

07:28.248 --> 07:29.249
pulling rabbits
out of hats.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.718
Rabbits?

07:30.751 --> 07:32.219
Nobody in my family knew it
at the time,

07:32.252 --> 07:35.823
but my father was only afraid
of two things:

07:35.856 --> 07:38.025
being broke and rabbits.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.927
It started in the '70s.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.863
While everybody else was
being scared by The Exorcist,

07:42.896 --> 07:45.733
my father was scared
by another movie--

07:45.766 --> 07:48.001
Night of the Lepus.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.605
Run, man!

07:59.112 --> 08:00.781
Can't your mother take you?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.115
Well, she told
me to ask you.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.118
Yeah, well, we'll have to see.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.186
I might have to work.

08:06.219 --> 08:09.056
Hey, maybe next time.
Sorry.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.290
Now I know why he always rooted

08:10.323 --> 08:12.660
for Elmer Fudd
to kill Bugs Bunny.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.228
Back before people got ripped
off by strangers on eBay,

08:15.262 --> 08:17.698
you got ripped off face-to-face
at the pawn shop.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.699
You are lucky.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.001
These are the last two
in the city.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.269
They just came in.

08:22.302 --> 08:25.105
All right, well, how much?

08:25.138 --> 08:26.540
Uh, 200 for the pair.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.009
$200?
I won't have enough for albums.

08:29.042 --> 08:32.145
Well, you could buy
$200 worth of records

08:32.179 --> 08:34.548
and then spin them
on your fingers.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.850
All right.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.018
Wait a minute.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.653
This one's missing a stylus.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.922
Oh, I didn't see that.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.323
Okay, I'll knock off
20 bucks.

08:43.356 --> 08:47.595
And I'll throw in
The Art of the DJ.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.563
The first and last issue.
All right.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.764
There you go.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.934
Hey, Kill Moves.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.002
Hey, Abe.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.069
Listen.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.137
How much can I get
for this here?

08:57.170 --> 08:58.606
What is it?

08:58.639 --> 09:00.841
It's a Technics 1200 stylus.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.676
Where'd you find that?

09:02.710 --> 09:04.712
Found it outside
on the ground.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.313
Must have fell off
one of these turntables.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.581
Mm-hmm. I'll give
you ten bucks.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.649
I'll give you 20.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.117
25.
15.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.184
Deal.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.921
This is your brain on drugs.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.889
Later, Chris.

09:15.923 --> 09:19.092
He later traded that money for
two dimes and a shiny nickel.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.228
So, you gonna throw
in the stylus?
30 bucks.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.631
30 bucks? You just
got it for 15.

09:24.665 --> 09:28.001
This is America.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.804
Supply, demand.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.148
I usually got robbed like this
in alleys.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.051
Oh, hey, baby,
here's your uniform.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.787
Did Drew ask you to take him
to a magic show?

09:46.820 --> 09:50.357
Yeah, um... did you know there
were going to be rabbits there?

09:50.390 --> 09:51.959
So?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.060
So...

09:53.093 --> 09:54.327
I'm allergic.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.096
To rabbits?

09:56.129 --> 09:59.132
Since when?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.133
I don't know.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.069
Since I was a
kid. I mean--

10:02.102 --> 10:04.204
So if they're going to have
rabbits there, I can't go.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.106
Can't you take some
allergy medicine

10:06.139 --> 10:07.708
or some 'Tussin?

10:07.741 --> 10:09.810
It's Robitussin,
not Rabbit-tussin.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.146
Look, Drew doesn't ask you
for much.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.983
All he wants you to do is
to take him to a magic show.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.151
A free magic show.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.087
This is important to him.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.422
You should be willing to wade
through a pool of rabbits.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.358
My father never went
near a pool again.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.161
Being a DJ was
all about your tools.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.830
If your tools were
professional,

10:29.863 --> 10:31.231
you were professional.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.332
And first on the list?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.201
A pair of Technics 1200s.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.703
Check.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.704
Mixer?

10:36.737 --> 10:38.071
No.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.406
Pair of professional headphones?

10:39.439 --> 10:40.908
No.

10:40.941 --> 10:41.909
Kangol?

10:41.942 --> 10:43.043
No go.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.144
Shell toe Adidas?

10:44.177 --> 10:45.178
Nada.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.214
Man.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.683
Looks like my hopes and dreams
are about to get crushed

10:49.717 --> 10:51.284
by the wheels of steel.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.291
I went back to the pawn shop
with the supply,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.093
hoping Abe would meet
my demand.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.228
Hey, Abe.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.765
That's a lot of stuff.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.999
What do you need?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.068
I need a pair
of professional headphones,

11:08.101 --> 11:11.138
a mixer, uh, shell-toe Adidas

11:11.171 --> 11:12.339
and a Kangol.

11:12.372 --> 11:16.476
If you got all that, you're
going to need one of these.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.111
Gold chain?

11:18.145 --> 11:21.882
Well, it's not real gold
but it's a real chain.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.353
* Get down
* Get down

11:26.386 --> 11:29.222
* And get up
* Get up

11:29.256 --> 11:31.491
* Get down
* Get down

11:31.524 --> 11:33.293
Hey.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.728
What's all this?

11:34.762 --> 11:36.129
My DJ stuff.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.831
Where'd you get the money
to buy all this stuff?

11:37.865 --> 11:40.167
Oh, I saved up.
DJ, huh?

11:40.200 --> 11:43.303
Yeah, I even got a job DJing
a party Saturday night.

11:43.336 --> 11:46.306
Uh-uh, what are you doing
with my James Brown album?

11:46.339 --> 11:49.209
Can I borrow it?
I need it for the party.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.911
Why, you had the money
to buy all this,

11:50.944 --> 11:51.845
why don't you buy your own?

11:51.879 --> 11:54.314
Well, I looked everywhere.
Nobody has it.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.483
All right, Mr. DJ.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.951
You'd better take care of it,

11:57.985 --> 12:01.254
'cause you know how I love me
my James Brown.

12:03.090 --> 12:07.294
Ow, Ooh. Funky now. Getting
funky now. Getting funky.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.429
Ow. They don't know nothing
about that.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.264
What you know about that? Ow.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.167
Ow. Jump back, I gotta catch
myself. Ow. Ow.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.236
If she was a Jackie Wilson fan,

12:16.269 --> 12:18.138
she'd be in the emergency room
right now.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.174
(James Brown's
"The Payback" playing)

12:21.208 --> 12:23.811
* Hey

12:29.449 --> 12:31.018
* The big payback

12:31.051 --> 12:32.385
* Sold me out

12:32.419 --> 12:35.155
* For chump change

12:36.123 --> 12:38.859
* Said my woman had it
all arranged *

12:41.061 --> 12:43.831
For the first time in my life
I was going to be a DJ.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.333
I felt like nothing
could stop me,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.268
unless I put a sign
over my head.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.569
* The big payback

12:51.371 --> 12:54.041
* For chump change

12:54.074 --> 12:55.542
* Said my woman had...

12:55.575 --> 12:57.845
* Said my woman had it
all arranged *

12:57.878 --> 13:00.413
Throw your hands in the air.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.215
Wave them like you
just don't care.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.285
If you love DJ Chrissy Chris,

13:05.318 --> 13:07.287
everybody say "Oh, yeah!"

13:07.320 --> 13:08.922
CROWD:
Oh, yeah!

13:08.956 --> 13:10.057
Hey.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.192
We're looking
for DJ Chrissy Chris!

13:18.631 --> 13:20.367
Uh-oh.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.237
:
* Payback, payback,
payback, payback... *

13:24.271 --> 13:27.407
I hope I could skip town

13:27.440 --> 13:29.877
before my mother hears
this record skipping.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.112
You scratched your mom's copy
of "The Payback"?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.380
I was trying to mix it.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.248
I don't get it.
It's already a good song.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.317
Why do you need to do
anything to it?

13:37.350 --> 13:39.386
Because a DJ needs
to rock the party.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.955
You realize I have no idea what
you're talking about, right?

13:41.989 --> 13:43.290
Yeah, I know.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.992
So did you tell your mom?

13:45.025 --> 13:47.094
No, I'm just going
to buy her a new copy.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.529
Well, what if she wants
to listen to it before then?

13:49.562 --> 13:52.065
If that happened, I would have
to keep her entertained

13:52.099 --> 13:53.533
the best way I knew how.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.402
(James Brown's
"The Payback" playing)

13:55.435 --> 13:58.171
* Revenge! I'm mad

13:58.205 --> 14:00.908
* Get down with my girlfriend

14:02.342 --> 14:04.077
* That ain't right

14:06.179 --> 14:07.247
Ow!

14:07.280 --> 14:08.281
* Smokin'

14:08.315 --> 14:09.482
* Hollarin' cussin'

14:12.552 --> 14:14.221
* You wanna fight

14:18.291 --> 14:21.328
* Payback is a thing
you gotta see *

14:22.963 --> 14:25.098
* Ow

14:25.132 --> 14:27.367
* Never do any damn thing
to me *

14:33.040 --> 14:36.243
* Sold me out
for chump change *

14:36.276 --> 14:38.211
* Yes, you did

14:38.245 --> 14:42.649
* Told me that they,
they had it all arranged *

14:42.682 --> 14:47.287
* You handed me down,
and that's a fact *

14:47.320 --> 14:50.223
* Now you're pumped

14:50.257 --> 14:52.392
* You gotta get ready

14:52.425 --> 14:53.893
* For the big payback

14:55.062 --> 14:56.396
* The big payback

14:56.429 --> 14:58.465
* That's where I am

14:58.498 --> 14:59.066
* Ho

14:59.099 --> 15:00.500
* For the big payback

15:02.502 --> 15:04.471
While I was looking
for the big payback,

15:04.504 --> 15:06.506
Drew was looking
for the big magic trick.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.044
Sorry we got here too late to
get the free TV Magic cards.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.212
Aw, it's okay.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.213
It's still
a pretty good show.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.949
What I want you to do is
hold those two balls.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.018
I'm going to take the
first one in my hand,

15:18.051 --> 15:20.420
and I want you to squeeze
the other one real tight.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.289
And watch what happens
on the count of three.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.024
One, two, three.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.693
And the ball has
completely disappeared.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.528
Now, if you slowly
open your hand,

15:28.561 --> 15:31.464
you will find two
yellow balls.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.435
He eventually got in trouble
when he did the two-ball trick

15:35.468 --> 15:37.537
without using props.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.706
And let's have a hand
for my lovely helper.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.175
You can have a seat.
Thank you, very much.

15:42.209 --> 15:45.312
And now for my next trick,
I'm going to need a volunteer.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.379
You, sir,

15:46.413 --> 15:47.680
do you mind
helping me out?

15:47.714 --> 15:49.449
Hey, go, Dad.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.251
All right, go.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.169
I need an advance.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.403
For what?

16:10.437 --> 16:11.471
"The Payback."

16:11.504 --> 16:13.073
The payback?

16:13.106 --> 16:15.375
Get down here quick.
What's up with the payback.?

16:15.408 --> 16:16.576
How'd you know
about the payback?
Who told you that?

16:16.609 --> 16:19.612
It's just talking
about the James Brown album.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.183
Oh, you talking about
"The Big Payback."

16:23.216 --> 16:25.152
Oh.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.187
What'd you think
I was talking about?

16:27.220 --> 16:28.255
Never mind.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.489
Anyway, man, I don't
loan money, man.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.557
It ruins relationships.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.093
I once loaned my mother money
for a bus ticket,

16:33.126 --> 16:34.494
never saw her again.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.796
So, you can't do it?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.766
Nope. Sorry, Chris, can't do it.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.501
All right.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.136
I should've said
I needed the money

16:43.170 --> 16:44.437
to overthrow the Sandinista.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.739
Hey, Chris.
Hey, Teedra.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.808
You still DJ-ing Jerome's party
on Saturday?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.610
Yeah.
Okay, I'll see
you there.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.444
All right.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.246
After I became a DJ,

16:53.280 --> 16:55.515
not only would I have the money
to buy my mother's record,

16:55.548 --> 16:57.317
but I'd also have girls.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.485
Hey!

16:58.518 --> 17:00.320
Lil' dude from
across the street.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.354
You remember Hilly Hill?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.622
Yeah, nice to meet you.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.756
All right,
I heard you did a good job

17:03.790 --> 17:05.125
at the party after I left.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.693
He act like he went out
for doughnuts.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.528
Yeah, I'm even doing
his next party, too.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.729
Oh, yeah. Which one?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.231
The one at his house.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.533
No, no, I'm DJ-ing that party.

17:13.566 --> 17:17.537
Look, lil' dude, you did a
great job, but this Saturday,

17:17.570 --> 17:19.472
I gotta let my man,
Hilly Hill, DJ.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.540
But you said I could do it.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.176
Yeah, but I thought
he was going to be in jail.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.411
I got out on a technicality.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.679
Translation: he killed a guard.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.149
But I bought turntables
and everything.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.351
It almost cost me $200.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.552
Look...

17:35.655 --> 17:37.124
If he gets arrested again...

17:37.157 --> 17:37.790
And he will.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.326
...maybe I'll give you a call.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.594
Sorry, lil' dude.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.766
Here's your dollar.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.268
Thanks.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.203
In his mind, we're even.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.239
Thanks a lot.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.776
While I was out of a job,
my father was out cold.

17:58.711 --> 17:59.646
What

17:59.679 --> 18:01.781
Dad, you saw a rabbit
and you passed out.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.617
Baby, I didn't know your
allergies were that serious.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.818
Dad, you're allergic
to rabbits?

18:05.852 --> 18:06.886
How come you didn't
say something?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.288
We could have sat in the back.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.824
Don't people usually get
rashes or something?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.493
I'm not allergic.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.428
Then how come you fell out?

18:15.462 --> 18:17.464
I fainted.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.499
I'm scared of rabbits.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.237
Baby, why didn't you
just tell me?

18:24.271 --> 18:26.839
What do I look like,
a grown man scared of rabbits?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.875
Like a grown man scared
of rabbits.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.278
Hey, sorry about the rabbit.
I didn't know.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.912
Hey, kid...

18:32.945 --> 18:34.414
Here's a TV Magic Set.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.915
Aw, thanks.
And here's a set

18:35.948 --> 18:37.917
of TV Magic Cards.
Autographed by Marshall Brodien.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.886
Oh, cool.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.289
Thanks for bringing me, Dad.

18:42.322 --> 18:45.792
Even when my father was scared
out of his wits,

18:45.825 --> 18:47.760
he was still able
to work magic.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.463
Even though I managed
to get my turntables,

18:50.497 --> 18:51.898
unfortunately for me,

18:51.931 --> 18:54.201
the tables turned
in the wrong direction.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.936
Aw, DJ career
over already?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.439
Yeah. So what can you
give me for these?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.574
Uh, I'll go 40 bucks.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.943
Forty? But I gave you
everything I had.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.447
Supply and demand, kid.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.948
When you came in,
I only had two.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.684
Now I've got six.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.321
Yeah, but you can't do
any better than that?

19:14.354 --> 19:15.455
I'll go $30.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.789
I'm not Kill Moves.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.757
Fifty.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.625
All right.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.864
Um... hey,

19:24.897 --> 19:26.666
You got "The
Payback" album?
Yeah, sure.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.834
Last one.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.236
Ten bucks.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.737
Hey.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.604
Kill Moves, what you got for me?

19:31.638 --> 19:33.706
What can you get me...

19:33.740 --> 19:34.607
for this.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.908
"The Payback."

19:35.942 --> 19:37.944
Where'd you find that?
Found it outside.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.412
Must of fell out of that jacket.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.548
I'll give you ten dollars
for it.
Twenty.

19:41.581 --> 19:42.682
Fifteen.
Fifty.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.616
Deal.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.717
Ha!

19:44.751 --> 19:47.320
He said $15, you gave him $50.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.655
Ha!

19:51.824 --> 19:54.727
Some things are just
not meant to be.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.863
I thought I wanted to be a DJ,

19:56.896 --> 19:59.366
but things just spun
out of control.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.734
(James Brown's
"The Payback" playing)

20:01.768 --> 20:05.605
It cost me over $200
to not be a DJ,

20:05.638 --> 20:07.674
but at least my mother would
never find out

20:07.707 --> 20:09.809
that I scratched her
James Brown record.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.311
* Payback

20:11.344 --> 20:17.650
:
* Payback, payback,
payback, payback, payback... *

20:17.684 --> 20:21.654
* Everybody, everybody,
everybody *

20:21.688 --> 20:23.790
* Everybody hates Chris.
