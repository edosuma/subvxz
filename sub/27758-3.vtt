You guys pee in the pool?

00:07.381 --> 00:08.756
Clap your hands if you pee
in the pool. Don't be afraid.

Estee didn't pass you.

00:11.339 --> 00:12.673
That was like a solid set.

-Nice.

-We had sex in a dressing room.
-What?

00:25.089 --> 00:26.547
PETE: And then again
in a bathroom.

00:26.631 --> 00:28.881
-MODI: Two times?
-In one day. A double schtup.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.422

Absolutely.

00:39.631 --> 00:40.923

00:57.089 --> 01:00.381
No. It feels weird.

-Yeah.

I mean your career.

Um...

02:11.214 --> 02:13.214
I want to get really good

No, that's-- that's the end.

Yeah, but you want to be adored.

02:25.881 --> 02:28.339
-No, no, that's--
-You want everyone
in this restaurant

02:28.422 --> 02:29.839
to know how special you are.

02:29.923 --> 02:31.964
You want to be unable
to walk down the street

02:32.047 --> 02:34.130
without everybody seeing you
and recognizing you

02:34.214 --> 02:36.047
and knowing how funny you are.

02:36.547 --> 02:40.631
No, I'm not David Hasselhoff.
I'm... I'm a comedian.

02:40.714 --> 02:42.047
No. Come on. Okay.

02:42.130 --> 02:45.047
Admit that it is driving you
fucking crazy right now

02:45.130 --> 02:48.297
that no one in here knows that
you are the next Kevin Hart.

02:48.381 --> 02:51.172
I'm not-- I'm not
the next Kevin Hart.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.547
Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart.

02:52.631 --> 02:55.839
We have a Kevin Hart.
He's perfect for the part.

02:55.923 --> 02:58.297
I'm just a...
I'm a club guy.

02:58.381 --> 03:00.422

I do spots.

03:00.506 --> 03:02.255

That's my--

03:02.339 --> 03:04.964
-You know, Madison Square Garden

-Okay. (sighs)

03:05.047 --> 03:07.589
I'm not-- that's
a different thing.

03:07.673 --> 03:11.589
The greatest honor in my life
would be to be in the scene.

03:11.673 --> 03:13.214
-I just--
-Wanting to be famous

03:13.297 --> 03:16.089
is not a bad thing,
and it's not embarrassing.

03:19.756 --> 03:21.756

I have a TV idea.

03:21.839 --> 03:23.756
(both gasp)

03:23.839 --> 03:25.422
(sinister laugh)
Tell me.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.547
-It's about a guy...
-Mm-hmm.

03:27.631 --> 03:30.005
...who has kids,
but the public schools stink.

03:30.089 --> 03:33.047
So he pulls them out,
and he starts teaching
them in his garage,

03:33.130 --> 03:35.964
but he's really good at it,
right? So word gets out,

03:36.047 --> 03:37.297
and other neighborhood kids

03:37.381 --> 03:39.130
start coming to his school
in his garage.

03:39.214 --> 03:42.130
And that's like--
that's the pilot, I guess.

03:42.214 --> 03:44.547
I've written,
like, an outline.

03:44.631 --> 03:46.589
"Holmes Schooled."

03:46.673 --> 03:48.547
-Yeah, Homeschooled.
-No, no, no, Pete--

03:48.631 --> 03:50.881
"Holmes Schooled."

03:50.964 --> 03:52.547
-No, no I--
-Like your last name.

03:52.631 --> 03:54.422
But it's not for me.
It's just Homeschooled.
It's for like a name.

03:54.506 --> 03:57.422
Why isn't it for you? This is
the perfect vehicle for you.

03:57.506 --> 03:58.756
I don't see it for me.

obsessed with this woman,

08:32.255 --> 08:38.047
and I looked at her
consistently for years,
but only her.

08:38.130 --> 08:39.714
Wait, so what are you saying?

08:39.798 --> 08:41.714

08:47.923 --> 08:52.089

so much like her...

you weren't her.

09:39.923 --> 09:42.381
You do... You do vision boards?

09:42.464 --> 09:43.547
Yeah.

09:43.631 --> 09:45.089
-Like for real?
-Yeah!

09:45.172 --> 09:47.089
This is what I want
my life to look like.

09:47.172 --> 09:49.381
Like I want to go to Italy

09:49.464 --> 09:52.089
or, like, learn
how to scuba dive.

09:52.172 --> 09:53.798
But...

09:54.506 --> 09:56.381
-I'm Prince William?
-Yes!

09:56.464 --> 10:00.005
You are the tall, blond, sexy,

10:00.089 --> 10:01.547
-kind of goofy--
-Kitty...

10:01.631 --> 10:05.339
-This is what you were doing
with your porn girl.
-Really?

10:05.422 --> 10:07.506
He looks like a candle
that smells like nothing.

10:07.589 --> 10:11.422
Okay, I don't literally want
to be with Prince William,

10:11.506 --> 10:14.089
but it's like your porn girl.

10:14.172 --> 10:15.756
You spent all of these years

10:15.839 --> 10:19.130
pointing your desire and your
intention towards this woman,

10:19.214 --> 10:23.631
who looks like me,
and then we just happen to meet?

10:23.714 --> 10:26.673
No, we manifested each other.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.714
You think I made you--
I mean...

10:28.798 --> 10:31.255
You can't have
all of that desire

10:31.339 --> 10:33.798
and not have it
manifest in the world.

10:33.881 --> 10:35.964
It's the law of attraction.

10:36.047 --> 10:38.047
Do you want to make one?

10:38.673 --> 10:40.005
I have some more
New Yorkers.

10:40.089 --> 10:42.964
-Oh, New Yorker  .
-Yeah.

10:43.047 --> 10:44.673
I read Playboy
for the articles,

10:44.756 --> 10:46.547
but I read New Yorker
for the pornography.

10:46.631 --> 10:50.047
-(laughs)
-I've been looking
for a photo of Mr. Rogers

10:50.130 --> 10:52.464
or Big Bird,
if you have either.

10:52.547 --> 10:53.839
Ooh!

10:55.464 --> 10:56.506
(as Ray Romano):
Debra!

10:56.589 --> 10:58.130
Yeah? You're into Ray Romano?

10:58.214 --> 11:00.631
I love Ray.
Everybody-- everybody...

11:00.714 --> 11:02.464
Can I have some paste?
I'd like to sniff it.

11:02.547 --> 11:04.964
-I have a surprise for us.
-Okay.

11:05.047 --> 11:06.673
Put your pants on.

11:07.923 --> 11:10.339
Where am I going
that I need pants?

11:10.422 --> 11:12.547
(music playing
over store stereo)

11:25.172 --> 11:26.798
(motor whirring)

11:29.798 --> 11:31.631
(motor grinding loudly)

11:35.130 --> 11:36.381
Hello, uh...

11:36.464 --> 11:37.881
Can we go?

11:37.964 --> 11:40.005
I don't like these
kinds of places. This is...

11:40.089 --> 11:42.214
What do you mean
"these kinds of places"?

11:42.297 --> 11:45.964
This isn't like a scuzzy
roadside jerk-hut.

11:46.047 --> 11:47.589
-No?
-This is The Pleasure Chest.

11:47.673 --> 11:50.172
It's a very classy place,
it's very clean.

11:50.255 --> 11:52.047
-The Pleasure Chest.
-Yeah.

11:52.130 --> 11:56.422
Argh! It's still very hard
for me to be here.

11:57.255 --> 11:59.422
Do you two need
any help with anything?

11:59.506 --> 12:01.214
-I think we're-- Yes.
-Yeah!

12:01.297 --> 12:04.631
So we are looking for something
that we can both have fun with,

12:04.714 --> 12:07.089
but he's sort of new
to all of this.

12:07.172 --> 12:08.547
-(uncomfortable laughter)
-Okay.

12:08.631 --> 12:11.422
Well, I always tell couples
to start with a Bullet.

12:11.506 --> 12:14.089
This is made of medical-grade
non-porous plastic.

12:14.172 --> 12:15.798
-Oh, medical-grade.
-It's great for external play.

12:15.881 --> 12:18.673
-You can do a lot
with this little guy.
-Wow.

12:18.756 --> 12:20.089
(laughing)
Oh, it's on.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.214
It's like a cocktail wiener...

12:22.297 --> 12:23.839
for your...
for your wiener.

12:23.923 --> 12:25.506
Hello?

12:25.589 --> 12:27.422
Sorry, I can't cock
right now.

12:27.506 --> 12:29.005
Yeah, I'm going through
a tunnel.

12:29.089 --> 12:31.673
-And then you... Woo!
-Kat: Oh.

12:31.756 --> 12:33.464
(chuckles)

12:33.547 --> 12:35.547
It's fun. Thank you.

12:35.631 --> 12:36.631
Um...

12:36.714 --> 12:39.214
What about this?
It looks like a seahorse.

12:39.297 --> 12:42.923
(scoffs) Well, that's
usually for anal.

12:43.005 --> 12:45.214
Have you, uh,
tried anal?

12:45.297 --> 12:46.339
-Pete: No.
-Kat: Yes.

12:47.506 --> 12:49.339
Well, let me know
if you need any help.

12:49.422 --> 12:52.005
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.130
What the fuck are you doing?

12:55.214 --> 12:57.255
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I'm trying to lighten the mood.

12:57.339 --> 12:59.422
-It's, you know--
-It feels like
you're shaming me.

12:59.506 --> 13:01.422
It feels like you are
trying to shame me

13:01.506 --> 13:03.130
for being into what I'm into.

13:03.214 --> 13:06.714
No, no. Absolutely not.
This is sexy.

13:06.798 --> 13:10.047
-This is fun. I'm all
for trying new things.
-Yeah.

13:10.130 --> 13:12.255
I'm happy to be
doing this with you.

13:12.339 --> 13:13.756
-I want to do
this with you.
-Good.

13:13.839 --> 13:16.005
-'Cause I'm gonna
put stuff in you, too.
-Great.

13:16.089 --> 13:17.381
I'm getting
this little guy.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.923
Hey, Easter comes
but once a year.

13:21.005 --> 13:22.547
And so do you.

13:25.089 --> 13:27.214
♪ ♪

13:29.673 --> 13:30.589
(giggles)

13:30.673 --> 13:32.172
(laughs)
What?

13:33.255 --> 13:35.381
(laughs)
Feels naughty.

13:36.339 --> 13:38.005
We should do
something...

13:38.089 --> 13:40.756
We should so something
wholesome to balance
the evening out.

13:40.839 --> 13:42.130
(laughing)

13:42.214 --> 13:44.714
We could go read
to the elderly.

13:46.089 --> 13:48.798
We could blow bubbles
at rescue dogs.

13:48.881 --> 13:50.255
(laughing)

13:50.339 --> 13:51.589
Pick one out.

13:52.214 --> 13:53.381
Um, hold on.

13:53.464 --> 13:55.172
We can get
the train this way.
But, um...

13:55.255 --> 13:57.464
No, there's something
that I want to do.

13:57.547 --> 13:59.964
Yeah, but this-- this is sort
of like where I work, though.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.714
This is like my office.

14:01.798 --> 14:03.297
We can just hook around.

14:03.381 --> 14:04.798
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just come with me.

14:04.881 --> 14:07.339
I have something fun planned.
You're really gonna like it.

14:07.422 --> 14:09.923
-Can we do it at home?
-No, we cannot.

14:14.923 --> 14:16.089
Kitty.

14:16.798 --> 14:18.089
Can we please not do this?

14:18.172 --> 14:21.214
Seriously, this is like
the last place I want to be.

14:21.297 --> 14:22.839
-Please.
-Face your fears.

14:22.923 --> 14:24.130
What are you--
What are you doing?

14:24.214 --> 14:26.172
This is the club you said
you wanted to play.

14:26.255 --> 14:27.381
Here we are.

14:27.756 --> 14:30.297
Okay, this is also the club
I told you I auditioned at,

14:30.381 --> 14:32.339
and it didn't go well.
I-- I told you this.

14:32.422 --> 14:35.464
Yeah, so that's why
we're here.

14:35.547 --> 14:39.005
No, the plan is I want
the booker to forget who I am.

14:39.089 --> 14:41.714
I'm not gonna show up
as some loser guy.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.964
So, what, you're just never
gonna come back here?

14:44.047 --> 14:46.255
No, they key is for her
to forget my face.

14:46.339 --> 14:47.756
-No, Pete!
-Then I come back.

14:47.839 --> 14:50.339
-She has to see you
all the time.
-No, she doesn't.

14:50.422 --> 14:53.214
-I'm not coming in here.
-So that she's like, "Oh wait.
This guy's got balls.

14:53.297 --> 14:55.422
"There's something that
I missed the first time,

14:55.506 --> 14:57.381
and he's fighting
for what he believes in."

14:57.464 --> 14:59.339
And people respect that.

14:59.422 --> 15:00.964
No, I think
people think it's weird

15:01.047 --> 15:03.214
when you're rejected
from something and you
keep showing up.

15:03.297 --> 15:05.047
No, Pete, you need
to be here all the time.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.464
You can't hide.

15:06.547 --> 15:08.964
-They need to get
tired of seeing you.
-Listen. No.

15:09.047 --> 15:10.923
-Just trust me, okay?
-Kitty, please.

15:11.673 --> 15:12.923
Please.

15:13.464 --> 15:15.047
This is business, okay?

15:15.130 --> 15:16.714
It's the art of war.

15:16.798 --> 15:18.047
And also, you're not
walking in alone.

15:18.130 --> 15:20.339
You're not a loser.
You're with me, okay?

15:21.381 --> 15:24.464
Hi, excuse us.
We have tickets.

15:29.005 --> 15:30.881
Shit, Pete Holmes.

15:31.839 --> 15:32.923
He's a comic.

15:33.005 --> 15:34.839
I know who the fuck
Pete Holmes is.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.381
Pete, you sitting
in the audience tonight?

15:40.839 --> 15:42.422
-Yes. Yes.
-Yeah?

15:42.506 --> 15:45.381
Don't worry about it, man.
I got the perfect seats for you.

15:45.464 --> 15:47.923
-That is so nice. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

15:48.005 --> 15:50.297
-Should we go? Thank you.
-Yeah. Good.

15:52.673 --> 15:54.506
Dude...

15:54.589 --> 15:56.130
I'd lose the hat if I was you.

15:57.172 --> 15:58.756
It's cool here.
It's smaller

15:58.839 --> 16:00.339
than I thought
it was going to be.

16:00.422 --> 16:02.297
-Very intimate. Very.
-Yeah.

16:02.381 --> 16:05.547
-It's nice.
-This is too close.

16:06.214 --> 16:07.589
-This is too close.
-No!

16:07.673 --> 16:11.464
You are right where you're
supposed to be right now.

16:11.547 --> 16:13.422
Ooh.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.047
-We didn't order these.
-These are from him.

16:19.214 --> 16:22.214
Kat:
Thank you! Cheers!

16:22.297 --> 16:24.422
That is so nice of him.

16:25.172 --> 16:26.673
Cheers.

16:27.381 --> 16:28.798
They're fucking with me.
You realize that?

16:28.881 --> 16:30.631
No, they're sending it over
because they know you,

16:30.714 --> 16:32.089
because you're a friend.

16:32.172 --> 16:34.172
-They're-- that's not--
-You're a friend. Drink this.

16:34.255 --> 16:36.005
These people are animals.

16:36.089 --> 16:38.005
-I'm drinking this.
-Kitty...

16:38.089 --> 16:41.673
-(cheers and applause)
-The greatest thing
about smoking marijuana...

16:41.756 --> 16:44.047
(laughter)

16:44.589 --> 16:46.130
...is smoking marijuana...

16:46.214 --> 16:47.839
(laughter)

16:47.923 --> 16:51.297
and then not smoking marijuana
for about a month,

16:51.381 --> 16:53.381
and then smoking marijuana.

16:53.464 --> 16:54.798
(laughter)

16:54.881 --> 16:56.464
Mm-hmm!

16:58.089 --> 16:59.255
So good.

17:00.297 --> 17:02.089
Ladies and people,
our next guest

17:02.172 --> 17:03.798
is a talented man.
Very funny.

17:03.881 --> 17:07.339
Put your hands together
and welcome Mr. Dave Attell.

17:07.422 --> 17:09.464
(cheering)

17:11.589 --> 17:13.547
(cheers and applause continue)

17:15.756 --> 17:18.172
Keep it going for William
Stephenson, everybody.

17:18.255 --> 17:19.130
(cheers)

17:19.214 --> 17:20.547
Dave:
Thanks.

17:20.631 --> 17:25.297
William, two words of advice:
sit-ups. Now...

17:25.381 --> 17:26.964
Hey, guys!

17:27.589 --> 17:29.756
This is a rough and ready crowd.
That's the way I like it.

17:29.839 --> 17:31.547
Let's take a look at everyone.

17:31.631 --> 17:33.547
It's nice to see
my condo board showed up.

17:33.631 --> 17:36.297
How are you guys?
Sorry about the weird smell.

17:36.381 --> 17:39.339
And, of course, the cast
of Hamilton  . Give them a hand.

17:39.422 --> 17:41.089
(laughter and applause)

17:41.172 --> 17:44.047
Dave:
And, uh... Oh shit.

17:44.130 --> 17:47.214
Is that...? Yeah, it is.
Hey, Pete. Yeah.

17:47.297 --> 17:50.964
You guys don't know this.
This is a comic, Pete Holmes.

17:51.047 --> 17:53.589
-Yeah, sittin' right up front.
-(light applause from crowd)

17:53.673 --> 17:54.923
Dude...

17:55.005 --> 17:57.756
-What the fuck, man?
-(laughter)

17:57.839 --> 17:59.339
Did you guys buy tickets?

17:59.422 --> 18:02.005
What's, uh... Yes.

18:02.089 --> 18:03.798
(laughter)

18:05.214 --> 18:07.464
She, uh,
she wanted to come.

18:07.547 --> 18:11.089
And you're the girlfriend?

18:11.172 --> 18:12.923
It's our
three-week-aversary.

18:13.005 --> 18:14.714
(crowd aw's)

18:16.422 --> 18:18.297
-Are you guys s-e-x-ing?
-Kat: Yeah.

18:18.381 --> 18:20.923
Yeah? I would love to see
you two scissoring all night.

18:21.005 --> 18:23.881
-It must be crazy. Yeah.
-(laughter)

18:24.881 --> 18:27.589
Miss, can I smell your finger?
I mean, really...

18:27.673 --> 18:29.089
this is just what it's about.

18:29.172 --> 18:32.297
It's the magic of that
fedora hat, I mean, honestly...

18:33.339 --> 18:36.089
You kind of look like
Timberlake without the power

18:36.172 --> 18:38.005
or money or talent.

18:38.964 --> 18:40.756
And, uh, did you
buy him that hat?

18:40.839 --> 18:41.756
You bet I did!

18:41.839 --> 18:44.631
Dave:
Yeah! Nice!

18:44.714 --> 18:47.089
You go out with a girl,
then she starts dressing you

18:47.172 --> 18:48.923
to look like a guy
she couldn't go out with.

18:49.005 --> 18:51.005
Dave:
So evidently,

18:51.089 --> 18:55.130
she has a 1930s reporter
fetish or something.

18:55.214 --> 18:57.923
Yeah, I really wanna bang a guy
that works at The Daily Planet.

18:58.005 --> 18:59.297
(laughter)

18:59.381 --> 19:02.047
(laughing)
I thought I was in the audience.

19:02.130 --> 19:04.172
He looks like any minute,

19:04.255 --> 19:06.964
he might do some
close-up magic for all of us.

19:07.047 --> 19:08.506
Pete...

19:08.589 --> 19:12.631
Pete, you better ice your balls.
This girl is awesome.

19:12.714 --> 19:15.255
Scoot over, Dan.
Hey, you guys are
never gonna believe it.

19:15.339 --> 19:18.255
Guess who's downstairs.
Pete Holmes is downstairs.

19:18.339 --> 19:19.798
Whoa, whoa. Pete Holmes
is in the audience?

19:19.881 --> 19:21.339
In the audience?
He's sittin' up front

19:21.422 --> 19:22.589
with this super-hot chick.

19:22.673 --> 19:24.547
I tell you, it's always weird
doing comedy

19:24.631 --> 19:25.964
in front of other comedians.

19:26.047 --> 19:28.381
So, obviously, there's no big
deal here, because...

19:29.923 --> 19:32.047
-Who's this?
Is that your girl?
-Yes.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.839
Are things that bad in Russia,
man, that you had to--

19:34.923 --> 19:36.589
-(laughter)
...that you had to--?

19:36.673 --> 19:38.255
So when you--
when you say fedora,

19:38.339 --> 19:39.673
are we thinking Guys and Dolls  ?

19:39.756 --> 19:41.089
Like ska band?
Reel Big Fish?

19:41.172 --> 19:43.964
Pete, I gotta say, your beard
looks better than mine.

19:46.756 --> 19:48.673
What is this? Oh, my God!

19:48.756 --> 19:50.589
-Seriously?
-(Mike scoffs)

19:50.673 --> 19:52.297
I don't know...

19:52.381 --> 19:54.172
Let's see.

19:54.255 --> 19:55.964
(laughter)

19:56.589 --> 19:58.631
Who wants to see
what's in the bag?

19:59.839 --> 20:01.214
This is the only place
in America

20:01.297 --> 20:03.297
where democracy still works.
All right...

20:04.964 --> 20:07.047
Uh, ooh, there's a feather!
What is this, tickling?

20:07.130 --> 20:08.839
Is this tickling buttholes?
Tickling buttholes?

20:08.923 --> 20:12.506
I actually think it's gonna
look good in the jazz man's hat.

20:12.589 --> 20:13.964
(laughter)

20:14.047 --> 20:17.005
Oh, we have found lube.
Look, look.

20:17.089 --> 20:19.381
It's a lot of lube, a lot.

20:19.464 --> 20:21.923
What do you have down there?
Pubic hair or a tumbleweed?

20:22.005 --> 20:25.506
Jessica:
What's that--
That's a lot of moisturizer.

20:25.589 --> 20:27.381
Pete, what were you thinking?

20:27.464 --> 20:29.464
It was an impulse buy.

20:31.089 --> 20:32.798
It's right by the register.

20:32.881 --> 20:35.089
-Did you taste this?
I have to taste it.
-Pete (laughing): No...

20:35.172 --> 20:38.839
-Yeah, I need to.
I have to taste this.
-(laughter and cheers)

20:43.255 --> 20:44.756
It tastes like brisket.

20:46.547 --> 20:50.756
This is cherry lube-- do you
know how juvenile that is?

20:50.839 --> 20:54.005
Like, I used this when I was,
like, 18, right?

20:54.089 --> 20:57.214
Yeah, it's really crazy,
but I'm hungry, so...

20:57.297 --> 20:59.381
(cheering, laughing)

21:03.339 --> 21:06.130
(applause and cheers continue)

21:08.673 --> 21:10.255
He never remembers
anyone's name, ever.

21:10.339 --> 21:13.255
I know, and he's such a legend.
He started with George Barlow.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.547
(laughter)

21:14.631 --> 21:16.339
(cheering)

21:16.422 --> 21:17.714
Whoop! Whoop!
Whoop! Whoop!

21:17.798 --> 21:19.631
Dan:
Oh, there it is.
Work it, girl!

21:19.714 --> 21:22.172
Pete, I gotta hand it to you.
You finally figured out how
to get into The Cellar.

21:22.255 --> 21:24.798
Pay the cover,
buy the two drinks,
and lose your dignity.

21:24.881 --> 21:26.756
-(Mike, Dan, Jessica laugh)
-That's funny.

21:26.839 --> 21:29.506
-You were great.
You really were.
-Kat: Thank you so much.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.756
-You know who's really funny?
-We're gonna go, gonna take off.

21:32.839 --> 21:35.589
-This guy!
-Oh! One of the best!
Are you kidding?

21:35.673 --> 21:38.089
Yes! He's...
one of my idols.

21:38.172 --> 21:41.214
-He's funnier than
all of you guys.
-Babe...

21:41.297 --> 21:43.214
-Pete: Babe...
-That is judgement I trust.

21:43.297 --> 21:44.589
-(laughter)
-Kat: Okay.

21:44.673 --> 21:46.464
I'm just glad
you finally found a fan.

21:46.547 --> 21:48.089
-Okay, um...
-We're gonna go.

21:48.172 --> 21:49.798
No, no, no.
Wait, Pete. Fuck that.

21:49.881 --> 21:52.422
-They need to hear this.
-Dan: Yeah, let's hear it!
Let's hear it!

21:52.506 --> 21:53.839
He's really funny.

21:53.923 --> 21:55.589
Aw! He is!

21:55.673 --> 21:56.964
Seriously! No.

21:57.047 --> 21:59.172
Like, you just do goofy faces,

21:59.255 --> 22:01.255
and then you seem like
you might be stoned,

22:01.339 --> 22:02.964
which is
really unprofessional.

22:03.047 --> 22:05.798
And then, I don't know,
you're just--

22:05.881 --> 22:07.297
I don't--
You're just not funny.

22:07.381 --> 22:09.089
-Oh!
-Mike: Oh!

22:09.172 --> 22:11.547
All right, all right.
Calm down, calm down.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.714
Pete:
That was fun.

22:13.798 --> 22:16.631
-Crazy, but fun.
-They're really funny,

22:16.714 --> 22:19.381
but there's a lot
of sadness in that room.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.506
Well, that comes with it,
I suppose.

22:21.589 --> 22:23.631
-Man: You're
gonna eat, right?
-Man 2: Yeah.

22:23.714 --> 22:25.422
What?

22:26.214 --> 22:28.381
(indistinct conversation)

22:30.255 --> 22:32.297
-That's Ray Romano.
-I know.

22:34.089 --> 22:35.673
-I can't believe it!
-I know!

22:35.756 --> 22:37.047
You have to go talk to him.

22:37.130 --> 22:38.631
-I mean...
-Right now,
let's go talk to him.

22:38.714 --> 22:40.589
I don't know if you can
just go up

22:40.673 --> 22:42.339
and say "hi" to Ray Romano.

22:42.422 --> 22:44.339
He's a comic.
You're peers.

22:44.422 --> 22:45.631
He's a legend.

22:45.714 --> 22:47.422
He's, like, my hero.

22:48.089 --> 22:50.089
The other thing is,
can we just order
the two mains

22:50.172 --> 22:52.172
-right at five?
-Ray: No, because
then we'll eat 'em.

22:52.255 --> 22:55.339
-Well, we'll eat 'em anyway.
-Yes, but we're gonna eat--

22:55.422 --> 22:57.297
Excuse me?

22:57.381 --> 22:58.547
So, I'm sorry.

22:58.631 --> 22:59.839
Ray:
Sure. Hey, man.

22:59.923 --> 23:03.297
Ray-- Mr. Romano,
I'm a huge fan.

23:03.381 --> 23:04.964
I'm a comic.
I'm a stand-up.
I'm Pete.

23:05.047 --> 23:07.839
Oh, okay. Thanks.
Appreciate it.

23:07.923 --> 23:09.464
But you're such
a big deal to me.

23:09.547 --> 23:12.089
The kind of comedy you do,
your story...

23:12.172 --> 23:14.381
It's an inspiration.
I love everything you do.

23:14.464 --> 23:16.381
Appreciate it. Thank you.

23:16.464 --> 23:18.547
Thank you.
This is Kat, I'm sorry.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.005
-How are you?
-I think you're hilarious.

23:20.089 --> 23:21.381
-Hello. Hi, Tom.
-I'm Tom.

23:21.464 --> 23:23.089
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Tom, nice to meet you.

23:23.172 --> 23:24.881
Pete:
I'm sorry,
I don't want to--

23:24.964 --> 23:26.714
You're on his vision board.

23:26.798 --> 23:28.339
Kat:
Just have
to tell you that.

23:28.422 --> 23:29.547
Ray:
What does that mean?

23:29.631 --> 23:31.673
Oh, man, don't scare me.
I scare easy.

23:31.756 --> 23:33.547
Kat:
No, it sounds freaky,
but it's like--

23:33.631 --> 23:35.297
You take pictures of things

23:35.381 --> 23:37.422
that represent, like,
your goals and your dreams

23:37.506 --> 23:38.881
and things that you want
to achieve.

23:38.964 --> 23:40.714
Then you put it on a poster
and then you look at it.

23:40.798 --> 23:43.214
And he literally today just,
like, cut out a picture of you

23:43.297 --> 23:44.506
and then put it on his board.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.005
Oh, wait a minute.
So you think, what--?

23:46.089 --> 23:47.839
It's like you set an intention,
and then you, like,

23:47.923 --> 23:49.923
you manifest the things that
you want to come true.

23:50.005 --> 23:52.756
-Like The Secret.
-It's The Secret.

23:52.839 --> 23:54.881
I don't want to burst
your bubble, but...

23:54.964 --> 23:56.589
you don't think that's
what got me here.

23:56.673 --> 23:57.631
'Cause I-- I come here.

23:57.714 --> 23:58.964
-But I came here, too.
-Yeah.

23:59.047 --> 24:01.756
So maybe it moved me
to come here, and maybe--

24:01.839 --> 24:03.589
maybe it also,
maybe plant--

24:03.673 --> 24:05.005
you know, I don't know
how it works.

24:05.089 --> 24:07.255
I-- I want free will.
Do I have free will still?

24:07.339 --> 24:10.047
I'm not saying
I made you leave your
house and come here...

24:10.130 --> 24:12.589
-Ray: I know. I get it.
-...but, you know,
the stars align.

24:12.673 --> 24:14.673
Uh, we gotta go.
We gotta go.
I appreciate it.

24:14.756 --> 24:16.964
I just want to thank you
for everything you do.

24:17.047 --> 24:18.756
-You got it.
-He's-- he, like, wants to--

24:18.839 --> 24:20.172
He's got, like, a sitcom idea.

24:20.255 --> 24:21.422
He, like, wants
to do a sitcom.

24:21.506 --> 24:23.255
I do. Well, yeah,
that's-- that's true.

24:23.339 --> 24:24.714
So it's not
just stand-up.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.631
-It's like, what you did,
I wanna--
-Yeah.

24:26.714 --> 24:28.589
I have an idea
about a guy

24:28.673 --> 24:30.673
who's fed up with
the public schools, right?

24:30.756 --> 24:32.589
And, um, so he pulls
his kids out and he starts

24:32.673 --> 24:34.005
teaching them in his garage.

24:34.089 --> 24:36.047
And then word gets out
'cause he's good at it.

24:36.130 --> 24:37.297
-He's good at it.
-Right.

24:37.381 --> 24:38.464
So then other kids
start coming,

24:38.547 --> 24:39.631
and it's called
"Holmes School."

24:39.714 --> 24:41.047
Kat:
His last name is Holmes.

24:41.130 --> 24:42.964
Pete:
Pete Holmes,
like homeschool.

24:43.047 --> 24:44.839
So it's a guy who...

24:44.923 --> 24:48.798
who lures kids
into his garage.

24:48.881 --> 24:50.839
Isn't that
a Dateline  episode?

24:50.923 --> 24:53.214
No, when you put it that way,
it does sound creepy.

24:53.297 --> 24:54.714
I-- I teach them.

24:54.798 --> 24:56.464
-Is that a sitcom?
Who knows?
-Pete: I mean...

24:56.547 --> 24:59.297
You know what? Maybe.
It probably could be.

24:59.381 --> 25:01.047
Put that on your board.
That's what you do.

25:01.130 --> 25:03.506
Take me down,
put that idea
on the board,

25:03.589 --> 25:04.839
and then we'll see
if it's magic.

25:04.923 --> 25:06.339
Here's the thing.
Listen to me.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.839
I wanna give you some advice.
You seem like a funny guy.

25:08.923 --> 25:12.881
Get on stage, man.
Be honest, be funny,
be yourself,

25:12.964 --> 25:14.923
and, uh...

25:15.005 --> 25:17.255
if it's supposed to happen,
it's gonna happen.

25:19.381 --> 25:22.464
-What's this?
-Don't. Don't do that.

25:22.547 --> 25:25.089
I'm sorry. I got excited.
I got excited.

25:25.172 --> 25:26.756
-We gotta go.
-Pete: Thank you.

25:26.839 --> 25:28.839
-Kat: It was
so nice to talk to you.
-Good luck.

25:28.923 --> 25:32.089
-Thank you. Thank you.
-I do like the hat, Pete.
I do like the hat.

25:32.172 --> 25:34.339

-Ray: It's Phil, right? Sorry.

I'm not sure how to approach
a woman.
