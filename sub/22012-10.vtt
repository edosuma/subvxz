WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.036
ADULT ADAM:
Ever since I was a kid,

00:02.103 --> 00:03.804
Billy Joel
was my musical idol.

00:03.871 --> 00:05.473
I loved
every album and video,

00:05.539 --> 00:08.909
but he blew my mind
when he released a song
like no other.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.944
* We didn't start the fire

00:11.011 --> 00:13.347
We Didn't Start the Fire
was an instant classic.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.549
The moment I heard it,
I was obsessed.

00:15.616 --> 00:18.752
* Joseph Stalin, Malenkov,
Nasser, and Prokofiev... *

00:18.819 --> 00:20.221
What is he doing?

00:20.288 --> 00:23.357
It's like
Billy Joel is singing,
but also rapping.

00:23.424 --> 00:27.428
No, it's like he's rapping,
but also singing.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.563
ADULT ADAM:
It became a point of pride
to memorize the lyrics.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.765
* ...Sugar Ray, Panmunjom
(TAPE REWINDS)

00:31.832 --> 00:33.067
ADULT ADAM:
And back before the Internet,

00:33.134 --> 00:35.369
the only way to learn them
was to just listen.

00:35.436 --> 00:36.870
The hell are you doing?

00:36.937 --> 00:37.938
It's the middle
of the night!

00:38.005 --> 00:39.006
Dad, thank God!

00:39.073 --> 00:40.974
Is it "Pumajob"?
"Pacman job"?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.610
Put on the damn headphones.
What is he saying?

00:42.676 --> 00:44.044
He's saying you're a moron.

00:44.112 --> 00:46.880
Now go to bed,
and also learn some history!

00:46.947 --> 00:49.117
And the best part? I did!

00:49.183 --> 00:51.552
Billy Joel actually made me
good at school.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.620
So, yes.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.455
We didn't start the fire.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.557
In fact, it burned right
from Harry Truman

00:56.624 --> 00:57.958
to the great cola wars.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.695
Normally, I am not a fan
of popular music,

01:01.762 --> 01:03.764
but this song teaches
and entertains.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.266
You don't like music?

01:05.333 --> 01:08.202
No. I enjoy the dulcet tones
of AM talk radio.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.038
That's sad.
I feel sad for you.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.707
I mean,
traffic, sports, weather,
you've got it all!

01:13.774 --> 01:14.808
But most importantly,

01:14.875 --> 01:17.711
Billy Joel taught me
girls dig rock stars.

01:17.778 --> 01:21.749
* Rock and roller cola wars,
I can't take it anymore *

01:21.815 --> 01:23.884
Wow! That was
totally badass.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.653
You like how I flipped over
the He-Man table?

01:25.719 --> 01:28.556
You know what?
You should perform that song
in the holiday talent show.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.090
You think?
I know.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.892
Not to completely
objectify you,

01:31.959 --> 01:34.462
but the whole thing
was insanely hot.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.863
Me, hot?

01:35.929 --> 01:38.366
Yeah, oh!
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

01:38.432 --> 01:40.134
Never thought I'd hear that
from a girl.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.136
Is it warm?
My cheeks are burning.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.305
What can I say?
You make quite the Billy Joel.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.973
More like Boopie Joel.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.809
* Schmoo didn't start
the fire

01:48.876 --> 01:51.945
* But his cheeks are gushy
and his tushy's squooshy *

01:52.012 --> 01:53.013
Give me a little nibble.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.315
Just look away, Jackie!
Look away!

01:54.382 --> 01:56.350
I am looking away,
but there's a mirror
right there.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.518
(GROWLING)
Aah!

01:57.585 --> 01:59.019
(LAUGHS)

01:59.086 --> 02:00.554
* I'm twisted up inside

02:00.621 --> 02:04.292
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:06.560 --> 02:07.995
* I don't know the future

02:08.061 --> 02:11.899
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:11.965 --> 02:14.302
ADULT ADAM:
It was December 13,
1980-something,

02:14.368 --> 02:16.870
and Erica
was back from college
for winter break.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.206
I have an announcement.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.607
We've spent
a lot of time together

02:19.673 --> 02:21.709
this holiday break...
Too much in fact.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.776
You've been home
for one day.

02:22.843 --> 02:23.944
You're feeling it, too.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.413
Which is why
I will be spending

02:25.479 --> 02:27.748
the first night of Hanukkah
at Geoff's house.
What?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.917
His parents invited me,
and I don't want to be here,

02:29.983 --> 02:31.385
so it's all lining up.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.753
Murray, your daughter
wants to spend

02:32.820 --> 02:34.622
the holiest day of the year
without the family.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.123
Say something!
Holy?

02:36.190 --> 02:38.091
Most years,
we give up halfway through.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.860
Murray, don't interrupt.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.430
It's a very special day,
so at the very least,

02:42.496 --> 02:43.564
we should come with you.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.266
Ooh, one problem...

02:45.333 --> 02:46.534
You're not invited.
Please.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.469
Linda and Lou Schwartz
are friends.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.570
They'd love to have us.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.771
You've never even
talked to them.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.973
Well, I sent Linda
a beautifully-worded note

02:53.040 --> 02:54.141
when Murray ran over
her foot.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.676
I signed my name
at the bottom.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.511
You are not crashing
their dinner,

02:57.578 --> 02:59.012
end of story!

02:59.079 --> 03:00.581
Damn it!
Quick, grab your pants.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.516
The Schwartzes are clearly
making a play
to take Hanukkah!

03:02.583 --> 03:04.752
Who's doing what now?
Murray, it is crucial

03:04.818 --> 03:07.187
that we establish ourselves
as the fun parents

03:07.255 --> 03:08.622
who host all the holidays.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.858
That way, if Geoff and Erica
ever get married,

03:10.924 --> 03:12.025
they come to us.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.727
Not those bastards. Us.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.663
Okay, I'm hearing
a lot of worry

03:15.729 --> 03:18.599
about things far in the future
that I don't care about.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.033
Oh, you better care!

03:20.100 --> 03:21.869
Hanukkah is
a gateway holiday.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.771
If they take that,
then they take Thanksgiving,

03:23.837 --> 03:25.506
then the Fourth of July,
then we're left

03:25.573 --> 03:27.608
with some crap holiday,
like Labor Day!

03:27.675 --> 03:30.344
What's wrong with Labor Day?
It's quiet
and we eat hot dogs!

03:30.411 --> 03:33.113
And so my mom swore
she'd win Hanukkah.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.048
Meanwhile, I was ready
to win over the crowd.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.149
Ow!

03:36.216 --> 03:37.885
(LAUGHS)

03:37.951 --> 03:39.152
That's the best.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.821
Still getting used to wearing
my shades indoors

03:40.888 --> 03:41.922
like the Piano Man.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.123
You're no Piano Man.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.492
Tell that to Jackie,

03:44.558 --> 03:47.027
who strongly urged my hot bod
to do the talent show.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.763
Come on!
What upside-down world

03:49.830 --> 03:50.931
are we living in here?

03:50.998 --> 03:53.200
How do you have a girlfriend
and confidence

03:53.267 --> 03:55.102
and a modest amount
of popularity?

03:55.168 --> 03:56.370
Hello!

03:56.437 --> 03:57.505
Pops!

03:57.571 --> 03:59.106
He's helped me
with all of it.

03:59.172 --> 04:02.142
He's even the one who gave me
the idea to serenade Jackie,

04:02.209 --> 04:03.877
and like always,
he was right.

04:03.944 --> 04:07.315
Wait, you take love advice
from our old grandpa

04:07.381 --> 04:09.950
who uses an entire tin
of cream cheese on one bagel?

04:10.017 --> 04:12.653
He helps me every day.
You're just realizing
that now?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.154
That's why you're always
chatting him up?

04:14.221 --> 04:15.356
What did you think
I was doing?

04:15.423 --> 04:16.690
I thought you were trying
to get his gold.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.891
He doesn't have any gold.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.027
All old people have gold.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.662
The gold is his wisdom.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.063
Lame!
Fine.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.498
Pops is lame,
and so am I.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.000
Lame or not, Barry couldn't
deny Pops had helped me,

04:27.067 --> 04:29.970
and so, with great humility,
he asked for guidance.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.038
Hey! My bagel!

04:31.104 --> 04:32.340
Forget the bagel.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.808
Schmear me with knowledge,
old timer.

04:34.875 --> 04:38.178
Wait. Are you actually coming
to me for advice?

04:38.245 --> 04:41.349
I realized you made Adam
suck way less.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.516
Be my sensei,

04:42.583 --> 04:44.918
and I will follow
whatever ancient wisdom

04:44.985 --> 04:47.154
you have in that
tired old frame of yours.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.090
As insulting as that is,
why not?

04:50.157 --> 04:51.825
I like a good challenge.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.594
I am a challenge.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.797
ADULT ADAM:
He was, but my mom faced
an even bigger challenge,

04:56.864 --> 05:00.334
making sure she didn't lose
Hanukkah to the Schwartzes.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.103
Linda, my God,
these latkes are to die for!

05:03.170 --> 05:04.171
Oh, it was nothing.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.373
She's not one to toot
her own horn,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.040
but I will. Toot-toot!

05:07.107 --> 05:08.208
(CHUCKLING)

05:08.275 --> 05:10.344
Am I crazy, or is this
actually going well?

05:10.411 --> 05:12.212
Oh! Almost forgot.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.914
Presents!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.248
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Wait! Wait, wait.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.317
No one said anything
about a gift exchange.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.986
We didn't bring anything.
Oh, don't worry.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.554
We just got you
a little something.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.323
Classic first night gift,
no big deal.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.693
Holy crap!
Streisand tickets?

05:25.759 --> 05:27.194
Summer sausage?

05:27.260 --> 05:28.529
Who are you?

05:28.596 --> 05:31.432
An indestructible rubber
Sony Sports Walkman?

05:31.499 --> 05:33.534
I always get crappy socks
on the first night.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.668
Not always!

05:34.735 --> 05:36.404
Last year, we forgot
about it completely,

05:36.470 --> 05:38.672
and then on the fourth night,
we were like, "Hanukkah!"

05:38.739 --> 05:41.742
Ha! She's wrong.
She's a big stupid liar.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.745
Point is, the holidays
are just as special to us.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.113
A savings bond?

05:46.179 --> 05:47.415
I can't touch this
for 10 years!

05:47.481 --> 05:50.017
So sensible!
LOU: Look at that punim!

05:50.083 --> 05:52.019
We're like twins!
Look at us!

05:52.085 --> 05:53.821
Well, look at this!
(LAUGHS)

05:53.887 --> 05:55.456
(SING-SONG)
We're twins, too!

05:55.523 --> 05:57.090
Mmm!

05:57.157 --> 05:59.827
See this?
This is the real gift...

05:59.893 --> 06:02.730
Erica and the Goldbergs
here for the holidays.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.799
It's the best!
You guys are the best.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.401
Those people
are human trash!

06:07.468 --> 06:10.337
Come on!
All the man did was give you
Streisand tickets.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.105
Third row center?

06:12.172 --> 06:14.174
Best seats in the house?

06:14.241 --> 06:16.944
These people are monsters
who will steal our children.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.513
While my mom envisioned
a lonely future,

06:19.580 --> 06:20.914
Pops was reminding Barry

06:20.981 --> 06:23.451
of his epic freshman year
talent show routine...

06:23.517 --> 06:26.720
Hyah!
...when he karate-kicked
his way to glory.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.422
That was
quite a night, huh?

06:28.489 --> 06:30.624
It was the first night
Lainey noticed me.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.725
Best of my life.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.527
What if I said
I could help you top it?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.596
You think if I do that show,
I can get a new Lainey?

06:35.663 --> 06:37.898
If Adam can impress a girl
with a serenade,

06:37.965 --> 06:39.132
so can you.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.368
And so, Barry took
Pops' advice,

06:41.435 --> 06:42.803
perhaps a little
too literally.

06:42.870 --> 06:43.871
Mr. Glascott!

06:43.937 --> 06:46.306
Oh, my God.
Oh, my Pop-Tart!

06:46.373 --> 06:47.675
Today was my cheat day!

06:47.741 --> 06:49.076
I have huge news.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.711
I'm signing up
for the talent show.

06:50.778 --> 06:51.812
I know it's last minute,

06:51.879 --> 06:53.547
but I will not take "no"
for an answer.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.149
And you won't have to.
There's like 14 spots left.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.051
Then consider it
your lucky day

06:58.118 --> 06:59.987
'cause you just got yourself
your opening act.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.322
Okay, you seem
way too fired up about this.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.757
Let me be painfully clear.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.759
This is a holiday
talent show.

07:05.826 --> 07:06.960
None of it matters.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.629
Oh, it matters.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.163
This is
the game-changer I need

07:10.230 --> 07:12.399
to become the most popular kid
in high school once again!

07:12.466 --> 07:13.501
It's really not.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.603
Honestly, this isn't
some high-stakes,

07:15.669 --> 07:17.137
life-defining event.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.338
It's just a wasted night.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.508
Then it's up to me
to prove you wrong.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.310
No! Do not use me to raise
the stakes any further.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.778
Just sign up and move on.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.514
Mr. Glascott!

07:26.580 --> 07:29.583
Big news, I'm gonna sing
We Didn't Start the Fire
at the talent show.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.951
No one cares!

07:31.018 --> 07:32.553
What he means to say is

07:32.620 --> 07:34.287
you can do anything
but that song.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.523
I'm opening the show
with it.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.857
You can't just
take my song.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.927
I'm just doing as my sensei,
Pops, commands.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.662
Pops isn't your sensei.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.230
He's my Jedi Master,

07:43.296 --> 07:45.799
and he'd never tell you
to do the same song as me!

07:45.866 --> 07:48.401
Hey, Barry, heard you were
opening the talent show
with Billy Joel.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.838
Why, yes, I am,
Jamie Weisman.

07:50.904 --> 07:51.972
See you there.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.641
What do you know?
It's already working.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.576
How the hell did she already
know you were doing the show?

07:55.643 --> 07:56.977
It literally just happened.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.812
She knew because Barry
woke up early

07:58.879 --> 08:01.448
and posted a few fliers
around school...

08:01.515 --> 08:02.516
A few hundred.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.684
Balls!

08:03.751 --> 08:05.953
"Holiday Talent Show
featuring Barry Joel"?

08:06.019 --> 08:07.721
Don't worry.
I'm still gonna sing
our song.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.590
It's kind of feeling
like your brother's song.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.924
It does feel that way.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.165
It was the second day
of Hanukkah,

08:18.231 --> 08:20.267
and my mom had her eyes
on the prize,

08:20.333 --> 08:22.536
stealing the holiday back
from Lou Schwartz.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.305
Thank you so much
for seeing me last minute,
Dr. Schwartz.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.340
That's Lou to you.
We're practically family now.

08:27.407 --> 08:31.078
Aw. Speaking of,
I wanted to thank you
for last night

08:31.144 --> 08:34.047
by hosting you guys
for the second night
of Hanukkah.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.016
Hold still for drops.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.851
While I do appreciate
the offer,

08:37.918 --> 08:41.088
night two is a Schwartz
family favorite,
so we'll be hosting it.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.957
Well, your son already
formally RSVP'd.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.493
I cornered him at school,
and he signed
the response card.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.828
Fine. You take night two.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.362
We'll do nights
three through eight.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.398
Six nights
and the closer?

08:51.464 --> 08:52.966
Okay, then you can
take night four.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.368
The hump day of Hanukkah?
How dare you.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.536
How dare me, what?

08:56.604 --> 08:58.438
I don't understand
why you're so worked up.

08:58.505 --> 08:59.940
Cut the crap, Schwartz!

09:00.007 --> 09:02.275
You're trying
to steal Hanukkah,
and it ain't happening.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.578
Like always,
my mom had spiraled out,

09:04.645 --> 09:06.346
but this time, she was right.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.981
Fine!
I knew it!

09:08.048 --> 09:10.517
You got me.
You are not
taking Hanukkah.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.085
Oh! I'm taking it.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.187
I'm taking all
the big-ticket holidays,

09:14.254 --> 09:15.388
and you can't stop it.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.824
Oh, I'll stop it
when I throw

09:16.890 --> 09:19.960
the most
mind-blowing night two
in Hanukkah history!

09:20.027 --> 09:22.930
You'll see.
Too bad you won't.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.364
What did you do?

09:24.431 --> 09:27.635
In a few minutes, your pupils
will dilate up real nicely.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.738
Good luck frying up a latke
in a hazy blur.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.239
You blinded me
from Hanukkah?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.074
Yes.
For three whole hours.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.409
You have made
a dangerous mistake,
Lou Schwartz!

09:36.476 --> 09:38.411
Blinding me has only
fueled my anger,

09:38.478 --> 09:40.714
and I will use my rage
to peel more potatoes

09:40.781 --> 09:42.750
than I've ever peeled!
Better watch your fingers.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.618
And you better
bring your appetite,

09:44.685 --> 09:47.487
'cause once I sour cream
and applesauce up a latke,

09:47.554 --> 09:49.723
it is game, set, Hanukkah!

09:54.027 --> 09:55.796
This is a war
you won't win!

09:55.863 --> 09:57.665
I already have!

09:57.731 --> 09:59.933
As my mom stumbled off
to dominate Hanukkah,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.936
my brother was mastering
Billy Joel's lyrics.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.805
* Harry Truman, Doris Day

10:04.872 --> 10:07.875
ADULT ADAM:
Back before Google, it took
patience and a good ear.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.043
Sadly, Barry had neither.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.745
* Joe is stallin'
Mellor's cough

10:11.812 --> 10:13.580
* Nose hairs
and pro coffee pots

10:13.647 --> 10:15.282
* Rock your fella,
salmonella

10:15.348 --> 10:16.950
* Chickens say "Bock!"

10:17.017 --> 10:18.686
* Toy bone, on the phone

10:18.752 --> 10:20.553
* Tossed panini, yay scones

10:20.620 --> 10:22.322
* Ben's friend Lew Falls

10:22.389 --> 10:24.024
* Walk around the block

10:24.091 --> 10:25.693
* Barf-O, booed a breast

10:25.759 --> 10:27.494
* Slamma Jamma, crew's chest

10:27.560 --> 10:29.229
* Prince is great,
paper plates

10:29.296 --> 10:31.131
* Trouble with Aunt Suzy

10:31.198 --> 10:33.901
* We didn't start the fire

10:33.967 --> 10:36.003
* Blah-blah-blah-blah,
blah-blah-blah

10:36.069 --> 10:37.437
* Blah, blah, blah

10:37.504 --> 10:38.505
* Blah, blah, blah

10:38.571 --> 10:40.240
You get it!
What do you think?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.308
I think it's amazing.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.143
Do this song exactly
like that, pal.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.178
Never let me stand
in your way again.

10:45.245 --> 10:49.049
A more insecure man
would wonder
why he's so pleased.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.684
But I'm not such a man.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.754
Um, Bar, I...
I think you messed up
a couple of lyrics there.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.023
Mmm... No.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.158
Dude, who's awful idea
was this?

10:58.225 --> 10:59.492
That'd be me.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.128
I... I'm his sensei.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.629
Mr. Grandpa, sir,
I would like

11:02.696 --> 11:04.664
to go on record
and respectfully say

11:04.732 --> 11:07.167
that your advice
will destroy Barry's life

11:07.234 --> 11:08.736
and that you suck at this.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.537
While Pops was regretting
the talent show,

11:10.603 --> 11:11.671
my mom couldn't wait
(DOORBELL RINGS)

11:11.739 --> 11:13.707
to show the Schwartzes
a real Hanukkah.

11:13.774 --> 11:14.908
Knock, knock!

11:14.975 --> 11:17.644
Not sure if you can see us,
but we're here!

11:17.711 --> 11:18.746
Doesn't matter!

11:18.812 --> 11:20.580
I can cook dinner
with my eyes closed.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.783
Come on in.
Sorry the place
is such a mess.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.218
A mess?
Oh, look at this house.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.654
It's like a Hanukkah
winter wonderland.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.157
Yeah, what's the deal?
We usually just
light a candle

11:30.223 --> 11:31.892
and get a lame gift,
like dental floss.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.594
Stop. When it comes
to the Festival of Lights,

11:34.661 --> 11:37.364
the Goldbergs really know
how to turn it on.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.465
(CLICKS)

11:38.531 --> 11:40.700
Wow. (CHUCKLES)
That is so festive.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.002
And dangerous.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.971
Last thing I'd want is
for you to burst into flames

11:44.037 --> 11:46.573
so we'd have to host Hanukkah
every year.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.842
You know what's even better?
Presents!

11:48.909 --> 11:49.943
(BEVERLY CHUCKLES)

11:50.010 --> 11:51.745
A hundred dollars?
That's insane!

11:51.812 --> 11:53.680
That's what you get
when you do Hanukkah here.

11:53.747 --> 11:54.748
Remember that.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.150
And, uh,
we have a gift for Erica.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.651
We do?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.220
Thirty-two dollars.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.923
And a shammy
for your glasses.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.624
Don't be silly.
It's time for dinner.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.660
I hope you have enough room
for eight courses.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.962
Prepare your tummies!

12:09.029 --> 12:10.864
Whoa!
GEOFF: Damn!

12:10.931 --> 12:12.732
Face it, Schwartz,
you're out of your league.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.267
That's it. We settle this
the way our people

12:14.334 --> 12:16.069
have settled fights
for thousands of years.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.204
In court?
No.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.505
With a game of dreidel.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.407
Winner takes
all eight nights.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.676
And I never lose
with my lucky spinning top.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.045
Until now.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.246
Let's light this candle.

12:26.713 --> 12:27.747
(CLICKS)

12:27.815 --> 12:30.317
(DREIDEL, DREIDEL, DREIDEL
PLAYS)

12:33.320 --> 12:35.188
(QUIETLY)
* Together, we will play

12:36.890 --> 12:38.725
Hey, kiddo.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.161
I... I've been thinking
about the talent show.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.897
Maybe we should give
that little song back to Adam.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.332
No can do.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.700
I already sent Billy Joel
the parking directions.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.902
No, that's smart,

12:48.969 --> 12:51.404
but I think you'd make
a much bigger splash

12:51.471 --> 12:52.940
by doing something funny.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.875
But it took me forever
to perfectly memorize

12:54.942 --> 12:56.743
every word of that song!
Bup, bup, bup.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.479
You promised to do
everything I say, right?

12:59.546 --> 13:01.548
Yes. Forgive me, sensei.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.016
So, what's your idea?

13:03.083 --> 13:06.619
The greatest
Abbott and Costello routine
of all time,

13:06.686 --> 13:08.822
guaranteed to kill.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.457
It's a famous skit

13:10.523 --> 13:12.826
about the players
and their funny names.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.995
It's called Who's on First?

13:15.062 --> 13:17.564
Who?
Exactly! So you know it?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.798
What?
Yes!

13:18.866 --> 13:19.933
"What's" on second.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.869
You started this thing!
You tell me!

13:21.935 --> 13:23.636
Okay.
Let me clear this up.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.605
"Who" is the player.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.140
"Who" is on first.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.009
Why won't you tell me?

13:29.076 --> 13:31.811
You know what, I think
you're gonna need
some visuals.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.580
Then you'll know
who's on first.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.848
Who?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.583
Ah.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.452
Okay, now you can
clearly visualize

13:39.519 --> 13:41.488
where each
and every player is.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.123
So, who's on first?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.357
Easy. Von Hayes.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.692
No. It's Who.

13:45.758 --> 13:46.960
Who is on first.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.696
I just told you,
Von Hayes.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.665
I'm not asking you
about the Phillies lineup.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.501
I'm telling you.
It's Who!

13:54.567 --> 13:55.568
Von Hayes.

13:55.635 --> 13:56.937
Okay, look at me.

13:57.004 --> 14:00.673
Ask me the name of the player
on third base.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.342
I don't need to ask you.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.676
It's Mike Schmidt, right?

14:03.743 --> 14:06.413
Wrong.
This is "I Don't Know."

14:06.479 --> 14:08.615
How do you not know
Mike Schmidt?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.984
He's a Gold Glove winner
and a perennial All-Star!

14:11.051 --> 14:13.353
Barry! Just listen!

14:13.420 --> 14:15.055
Who is on first!

14:15.122 --> 14:16.924
Who! I'm telling you!

14:16.990 --> 14:18.825
Who is the name!

14:18.892 --> 14:20.827
And I told you!
His name is...

14:20.894 --> 14:23.296
Don't you dare say
Von Hayes!

14:23.363 --> 14:24.364
(MUTTERING) Von Hayes.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.866
Okay.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.369
Now we're literally
on a baseball field

14:29.436 --> 14:31.939
with your friends holding up
the names.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.107
It cannot be any clearer.

14:34.174 --> 14:38.378
So, tell me the name
of the player on third.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.479
I Don't Know.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.848
Barry, do you
really not know

14:41.915 --> 14:44.517
or do you know
it's I Don't Know.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.852
It's I Don't Know.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.187
And What's on second.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.022
And Who's on first.
Yes!

14:49.089 --> 14:51.091
Yeah, baby!
Only two hours!

14:51.158 --> 14:52.225
Can we go home now?

14:52.292 --> 14:54.594
One question.
Why is it funny?

14:54.661 --> 14:57.130
No one on Earth
would name their son Who!

14:57.197 --> 14:58.331
He's right.
Kind of lame.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.399
Okay, here's what
I'm gonna do.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.900
I'm gonna make this
actually funny

15:00.968 --> 15:02.035
by changing all the names.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.136
Don't change the names.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.305
First base is
Mr. ClownFarts.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.274
Second base is
Bob Frapples.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.242
And third base
is Giant (BLEEP) Face.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.744
No!
Those aren't real names!

15:11.811 --> 15:14.614
They're more real than
your first baseman, Mr. Who!

15:14.681 --> 15:16.249
It makes no sense!

15:16.316 --> 15:18.851
No parent with the last name
of (BLEEP) Face

15:18.918 --> 15:21.288
would name
their child Giant! Ever!

15:21.354 --> 15:22.922
Then what would
they name him?

15:22.990 --> 15:24.524
Josh!
Screw it!

15:24.591 --> 15:25.993
I'm going back to being
Barry Joel.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.794
Barry, don't do that show.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.729
I'm just trying
to protect you here.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.864
From what?
From yourself!

15:31.931 --> 15:34.367
You don't know
any of the words
to that song,

15:34.434 --> 15:36.769
and I can't help you
like I did with the karate!

15:36.836 --> 15:37.904
What do you mean, help?

15:37.971 --> 15:40.907
I swapped in a board
made of balsa wood!

15:40.974 --> 15:43.476
Balsa wood better be
the strongest of all woods.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.245
Bro, it breaks
like a Kit Kat bar.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.614
That better be the strongest
of all candy bars.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.915
It's not, dude.

15:48.982 --> 15:52.719
Look, if I didn't actually
break that board,

15:52.785 --> 15:55.788
then the best night
of my life
is nothing but a lie.

15:55.855 --> 15:56.889
That's not true, kiddo.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.391
No. I get it.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.693
Even you can't help me.

16:01.728 --> 16:02.762
I'm unfixable.

ADULT ADAM: As everyone
waited for dinner,

16:09.636 --> 16:12.739
my mom's plans to win Hanukkah
were spinning out of control.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.474
Boom! Squiggly again!

16:14.541 --> 16:16.743
Send the bread to Fred,
the Schwartzes win.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.046
Okay, double or nothing.
You win, you get Thanksgiving.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.247
You're on!
Okay.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.414
My turn, I'll spin.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.815
No, no, no.
It's my dreidel!

16:22.882 --> 16:25.385
I'm the spinner!
No, no! (CHUCKLES)

16:25.452 --> 16:27.054
Yes! Squiggly! (LAUGHS)

16:27.120 --> 16:28.588

on the board.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.689
Look at that!
You got one.

16:29.756 --> 16:30.790
Game's over.
Happy Hanukkah.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.459
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!

16:32.525 --> 16:34.361
That's six squiggles
in a row.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.428
What?

16:35.495 --> 16:36.896
Is this a loaded dreidel?
No!

16:36.963 --> 16:40.500
Did you bring a loaded dreidel
into my home?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.569
There's no such thing.
Is that right?

You can prove nothing!

16:52.712 --> 16:54.147
Okay, what is all
the yelling about?

16:54.214 --> 16:55.615
I thought we were supposed
to have dinner.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.650
Lou, what is going on?
The kids need to pick!

16:57.717 --> 16:59.352
Which one of us is gonna be
the fun in-laws

16:59.419 --> 17:00.820

all the holidays with?

17:00.887 --> 17:02.589
What are you talking about?
Why is your shoe off?

17:02.655 --> 17:04.224
He was cheating at dreidel!

17:04.291 --> 17:05.792
Okay, everybody stop!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.328
There is no holiday house!
We're just dating!

17:08.395 --> 17:10.330
Pick right now!
Erica, say us.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.031
Say us
or I have no daughter.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.100
You have
to pick me, Geoffrey,

17:13.166 --> 17:14.401
or you're out
of my will forever!

17:14.467 --> 17:15.935
You know, the whole point
of this holiday

17:16.002 --> 17:18.004
was for our families
to get to know each other.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.972
Yeah.
Thanks for ruining it.

her precious holiday,

17:31.884 --> 17:34.287

for the talent show.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.056
Okay. What am I
looking at here?

17:37.124 --> 17:38.658
Not that it's any
of your business,

17:38.725 --> 17:42.562

a new super-sexy act
for the talent show.

Put the scarves away, kiddo.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.599
You can do
the Billy Joel song.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.067
What? Barry gave up?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.402
Mmm, just on me.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.003
He finally came to me
for help,

17:51.070 --> 17:52.505
and I let him down.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.606
No, don't do that!

Don't make me feel sad
for him.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.610
The guy stole my song
and my Jedi grandpa.

Kiddo, I've helped you
your whole life,

18:00.046 --> 18:02.949

I need your help.

in here,

Please.
We both know I suck at it.

he wouldn't just rap.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.211
He wouldn't just sing.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.079
He'd rap-sing

start a fire...
