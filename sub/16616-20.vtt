00:01.543 --> 00:04.630
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.963 --> 00:08.091
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:11.637
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.970 --> 00:14.431
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:17.726
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:21.480
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.647 --> 00:23.065
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:24.650
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:29.905
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:38.121
<i>This program</i>
<i>is brought to you by fruit bouquets.</i>

00:38.330 --> 00:41.166
<i>Got a birthday coming up</i>
<i>for someone you absolutely hate?</i>

00:41.291 --> 00:42.918
<i>Why not tell them to go screw themselves</i>

00:43.001 --> 00:44.670
<i>by sending a giant fruit bouquet?</i>

00:44.920 --> 00:46.088
<i>With just a few clicks,</i>

00:46.171 --> 00:49.591
<i>you'll be able to send someone 14 pounds</i>
<i>of unwanted decorative produce</i>

00:49.675 --> 00:52.052
<i>that will go bad within an hour</i>
<i>of arrival.</i>

00:52.261 --> 00:54.429
<i>Hungry for a strangely warm strawberry?</i>

00:54.513 --> 00:57.724
<i>How about a hard, green wedge</i>
<i>or a slime-glazed melon ball?</i>

00:57.850 --> 00:59.935
<i>Well, we have all these gross things.</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:03.021
<i>Order now and make someone feel guilty</i>
<i>about throwing it straight into the trash</i>

01:03.146 --> 01:05.065
<i>six hours later. Fruit bouquets!</i>

01:05.148 --> 01:06.733
<i>The rotting gift with flies on it.</i>

01:07.484 --> 01:09.862
Okay, I'm heading out for ladies night.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.906
There's a casserole in the refrigerator.
I'll be home at 11:00.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.449
- Hey, Lois?
- Yeah.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.244
How would you find out the name
of the actual actress

01:17.327 --> 01:19.037
who plays the AT&T chick?

01:19.162 --> 01:22.457
I left a list of hot commercial girls
on the refrigerator.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.960
What is this refrigerator
you keep mentioning?

01:25.043 --> 01:26.587
Are you talking about the sandwich house?

01:26.962 --> 01:30.299
I guess I'm not the only person
with a useless husband.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.301
I mean, look at Mrs. Butterworth's.

01:32.551 --> 01:35.304
I still don't understand
why we couldn't take my last name.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.432
Well, my last name
helps keep a roof over our head

01:38.515 --> 01:40.976
- and pays for your hobby.
-"Hobby"?

01:42.436 --> 01:45.856
Oh, look at that,
my business line is ringing.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.567
Hello. Lamps that look like soccer balls.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.735
Yes.

01:49.902 --> 01:50.903
Okay.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.821
How many would you like to return?

01:52.905 --> 01:54.907
Yeah. Just send them here.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.159
Care of Mr. Butterworth.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.168
Oh, it's so nice getting out of the house.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.921
If I had to change one more diaper
I was going to lose it.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.131
I'm in exactly the same boat.

02:11.215 --> 02:15.177
I mean, what would our husbands do
if they had to change their own diapers?

02:15.260 --> 02:17.804
Different boat, Bonnie.
Much different boat.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.557
Hey, I got an idea.
Let's crank call them.

02:22.684 --> 02:26.897
You're weak, Cleveland.
You're worthless and weak.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.274
- You've found Brown.

02:29.775 --> 02:32.444
Hello, Cleveland. This is Michelle Obama.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.112
- <i>It is?</i>
- Yes.

02:34.196 --> 02:37.866
I've received all your letters
and I do like your mustache.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.286
Oh. I've been doing all your
arm exercises.

02:41.453 --> 02:44.373
<i>Thank you,</i>
<i>but those won't work on your fat arms.</i>

02:44.456 --> 02:46.333
How do you know my arms are fat?

02:46.416 --> 02:48.836
I deliberately left them out
of all the photos.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.839
<i>You're eating a pie on the toilet,</i>
<i>aren't you, Cleveland?</i>

02:52.047 --> 02:54.299
Who is this? Is this a jerky boy?

02:54.466 --> 02:56.051
It's your wife, you big dummy.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.433
I used to have my own show.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.564
- Hello.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.482
Hello, is this Joe Swanson?

03:10.649 --> 03:13.360
- Wait. You can talk normal?
- What do you mean?

03:13.652 --> 03:16.572
- Never mind.
- We're calling from WQHG,

03:16.655 --> 03:17.865
Quahog's hottest hits.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.243
And we'll give you $500
if you can sing Britney Spears'

03:21.326 --> 03:23.203
<i>I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman.</i>

03:23.370 --> 03:24.580
You've got 10 seconds to...

03:24.663 --> 03:26.498
<i>I'm not a girl</i>

03:26.582 --> 03:28.375
<i>Not yet a woman</i>

03:28.625 --> 03:31.170
<i>All I need is time...</i>

03:31.253 --> 03:32.838
Oh, but you have to be able to walk.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.423
<i>Ah, nuts.</i>

03:36.675 --> 03:38.677
Okay. My turn, my turn.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.391
Hello. Don't say anything about the
1998 Oscars, I'm watching it now.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.894
<i>Hello, is this Peter Griffin?</i>

03:47.144 --> 03:49.438
If this is the fracking people,
I have made it clear

03:49.521 --> 03:51.690
that I am 100% on board.

03:51.773 --> 03:55.569
<i>No, my name is Rebecca.</i>
<i>You've never met me before</i>

03:55.694 --> 03:59.698
<i>and probably don't even know I exist,</i>
<i>but you're my father.</i>

04:01.783 --> 04:03.535
- Hello?
- <i>How'd you get this number?</i>

04:03.660 --> 04:05.120
<i>Don't you ever call here again!</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:06.538
- What the hell?

04:06.914 --> 04:09.333
- He just got mad and hung up.
- He what?

04:09.625 --> 04:12.294
- Why?
- I don't know. He sounded weird.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.962
Like, when he was an NFL announcer

04:14.046 --> 04:17.049
and had to pretend he cared
about the shows after the game.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.885
<i>Patriots calling their</i>
<i>third and final time out.</i>

04:19.968 --> 04:23.430
<i>Hey, after the game, keep it here</i>
<i>for an all new</i> Madam Secretary.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.392
<i>Tonight Madam Secretary faces</i>
<i>an international crisis in Pakistan,</i>

04:27.518 --> 04:29.937
<i>while her teenage daughter</i>
<i>faces her own crisis</i>

04:30.062 --> 04:31.313
<i>finding a date for the prom.</i>

04:31.396 --> 04:33.607
Madam Secretary,<i> tonight on CBS.</i>

04:33.899 --> 04:36.527
<i>Is this the longest time-out of all time?</i>

04:42.241 --> 04:43.283
Hey, Peter?

04:43.450 --> 04:46.578
So, um,
anything interesting happen tonight?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.748
Yup. I finally peed that chunk of poo
off the side of the bowl.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.500
You know, the one you've been yelling
at me about.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.545
- Nobody called or anything?
- Nope.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.882
So, hey, uh, are you tipsy enough
to let me have lazy Tony Soprano sex?

04:58.966 --> 05:01.760
You know, where I just lie there
and arch my hips a little bit

05:01.844 --> 05:03.303
and breathe like a dying whale.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.848
- Uh, I don't know.
- All right. Well, just in case,

05:05.931 --> 05:08.851
I'll be upstairs getting into my boxers
and black socks.

05:25.617 --> 05:29.246
Do you think it's possible
he actually has an illegitimate child?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.123
I don't know, but something's going on

05:31.206 --> 05:33.667
because I'm telling you,
he lied right to my face.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.587
Sometimes friends put wine out
for each other.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.172
I just don't understand it.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.424
I mean, we don't keep secrets
in this house.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.759
We didn't even keep the Pop Secret,
secret.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.890
- Psst. Hey, did you hear?
- Hear what?

05:47.973 --> 05:50.350
Orville Redenbacher is gay.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.228
But he has a son,
he's in the commercial.

05:53.312 --> 05:56.023
His son's gay, too. They're both gay.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.650
They have sex parties
in the Hollywood Hills.

05:58.734 --> 06:02.529
It sounds like you're just
making up stories about your competitors.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.656
- You're gay, too.
- What?

06:06.325 --> 06:08.076
Ah! You're a psycho!

06:08.493 --> 06:10.329
Dad, you're never going to believe what...

06:10.412 --> 06:13.415
Chris, meet Orville Redenbacher
and his son. Watch.

06:17.503 --> 06:21.673
And that's where we get the expression,
"Gay as a bag of popcorn."

06:22.508 --> 06:25.177
- All right, I'll see you later.
- What? Where are you going?

06:25.260 --> 06:26.887
Laser tag orientation.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.098
Well, that's obviously not true.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.934
Yeah, that boy got liarrhea.

06:32.017 --> 06:35.270
Oh, my God. I got to follow him,
find out where he's really going.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.355
Good idea.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.774
If I was you I'd stick to him
like gluerrhea.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.485
Okay, I think I'm starting
to crack your code.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.695
Quick. Brian, I need your car.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.615
I don't know, Lois. You're not
on the insurance and I don't think...

06:55.207 --> 06:56.917
Fruit bouquet
for Brian Griffin.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.502
Happy birthday, buddy.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.566
What the hell?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.236
Peter, what are you doing here?

07:24.528 --> 07:27.698
Lois! I was...
I'm just, uh, shopping.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.075
Yeah. I'll take a large sperm, please.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.952
Nice going.
Now you've ruined Christmas.

07:32.202 --> 07:35.080
Peter Griffin, you tell me
what's going on right now.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.375
Okay, fine.
I'll be honest with you.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.753
A long while back,
just before we got married,

07:42.171 --> 07:45.340
- I was a little short of cash.
- What? To buy our rings?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.594
No. I wanted to pay
for dial up modem impression classes. See.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.816
Wow, that's pretty good. I...

08:02.941 --> 08:04.359
<i>You've got mail.</i>

08:04.610 --> 08:07.070
Okay, but hang on.
You were a sperm donor?

08:07.279 --> 08:09.114
Yeah. I had almost forgotten about it,

08:09.198 --> 08:12.826
but then last night I get this call
from a woman who says she's my daughter.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.871
Peter, that was me.
I was prank calling you.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.457
You what?
I can't believe you would do that to me.

08:18.624 --> 08:21.877
Can you guys argue elsewhere.
You're making it tough to finish in here.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.087
No. Fight louder.
Call her a bitch!

08:24.671 --> 08:27.257
But I don't understand.
Why did you come here today?

08:27.466 --> 08:29.760
'Cause that call last night gave
me a scare.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.553
I figured if I do have a kid out there,

08:31.637 --> 08:33.889
I want to make sure
they're not giving out my information.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.599
They're not supposed to.
I signed a form.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.227
Hold on, Peter.
I'm sorry I tricked you.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.812
But if you do have a child out there,

08:40.896 --> 08:43.106
isn't it only fair to let him or her
meet you?

08:44.274 --> 08:46.026
Maybe you're right.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.696
I mean, as long as we're here,
maybe you should sign a consent form.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.491
Okay. Yeah. All right. I'll do it.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.578
You know what? It feels good
doing something nice for others.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.622
Like when I was a mentor for Kid Rock.

08:59.248 --> 09:02.835
Okay. I took a leak into this can
of Busch Light without spilling.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.253
You're ready.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.796
You don't need me anymore.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.297
Will I see you again, Peter?

09:07.548 --> 09:10.926
Wherever a father weighs less
than his daughter, I'll be there.

09:11.510 --> 09:14.805
Wherever someone has a banner
for a football team as a curtain,

09:14.888 --> 09:16.431
I'll be there.

09:16.515 --> 09:19.476
Wherever there's a fight
in a Waffle House, I'll be there.

09:20.519 --> 09:24.231
Now go. People need a concert to go to
after the water park.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.161
Hi, is, uh... Is Peter Griffin here?

09:38.829 --> 09:41.540
- Oh, my God.
- Is everything okay?

09:41.665 --> 09:45.210
- Yes. It's just... You look just like...
- What's going on?

09:45.294 --> 09:47.838
- Who's this super model?
- I'm Katie.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.548
I'm your daughter.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.175
You're what?

09:51.300 --> 09:52.426
Holy crap!

09:52.509 --> 09:54.303
Yeah. I hope you don't mind the drop in?

09:54.386 --> 09:57.055
But the, uh, sperm bank
said it was okay to contact you.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.225
Yeah. I guess...
I guess I didn't expect this so soon.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.603
Well, we were all
pretty excited to meet you.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.438
What do you mean, "we"?

10:10.360 --> 10:11.612
Hi, Dad!

10:12.404 --> 10:14.740
We're all your children.
We came from your semen.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.700
Semen.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.537
- Semen.
- Semen.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.082
Oh, sorry. Wrong house.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.293
Look. Eddie's at the wrong house.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.351
Peter, how many times
were you a sperm donor?

10:42.518 --> 10:45.896
Only once. But I had just seen
Uma Thurman in <i>Beautiful Girls,</i>

10:45.979 --> 10:47.606
so it was kind of a kablamo.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.651
You ever seen those videos
where they put Mentos in Diet Coke?

10:50.734 --> 10:54.780
Uh, listen. I want all of you to know
how happy we are to meet you.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.908
In fact, this calls for a celebration.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.535
Can you all stay for dinner?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.119
Aw, we'd love that!

11:01.286 --> 11:03.205
- Wouldn't we, guys?
- Yeah, absolutely.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.083
- You said it, babe.
- Yeah. Chinese Peter very hungry.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.876
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, Lois.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.087
Just 'cause they're my kids
and they all look like me

11:10.170 --> 11:11.797
doesn't mean we have anything in common.

11:18.804 --> 11:19.805
Daddy.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.781
I've never felt proud
of any of my children until now.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.246
This is so exciting.

11:44.329 --> 11:47.416
For years I have dreamed of one day
traveling from Bavaria

11:47.499 --> 11:50.586
to play the accordion for my birth family.
May I?

11:56.008 --> 11:57.551
I have just one question for you.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.637
What are those?

12:00.721 --> 12:04.266
Oh, I get that. Because this comedy
has just made it to Germany.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.227
Wow. You look exactly like me.

12:07.311 --> 12:10.564
Yes. I'm not actually
part of sperm donation thing.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.191
I'm your secret clone.

12:12.441 --> 12:15.694
We have been <i>Orphan Black-</i>ed
and you soon will be dead.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.535
- Meg, where are you?
-I'm right here, Mom.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.372
Wow, look at your fine ass.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.875
- Are you talking to me?
- Damn right.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.377
I've been looking around this whole house
for something to nibble on,

12:32.461 --> 12:33.962
I think I just found it.

12:34.046 --> 12:36.632
So many confusing feelings!

12:36.965 --> 12:38.300
<i>- Dad.</i>
<i>- Sex.</i>

12:38.383 --> 12:41.136
<i>- Black woman.</i>
<i>- Historically low mortgage rates.</i>

12:41.470 --> 12:43.597
Ah! I got to go buy a house.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.392
Lois! Lois, can I keep
the little Persian Peter?

12:47.601 --> 12:48.936
No. They're too much work.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.979
But I'll take care of it. I promise.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.774
You always say that and I'm the one
who always ends up feeding them

12:53.857 --> 12:55.651
and walking them,
and doing all the clean up.

12:55.859 --> 12:59.947
Excuse me, I'm a candidate
for a doctorate in classics at Wesleyan.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.907
It talks. Lois, it talks!

13:04.368 --> 13:05.410
Ah!

13:07.412 --> 13:08.622
Whoa, that was close.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.291
You almost dipped one of your yabos
in the marinara.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.503
- Let me help you with those.
- Well, thank you. That's so sweet.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.339
You're the first person
who looks anything like my husband

13:17.422 --> 13:19.007
who's offered to help in any way.

13:19.091 --> 13:21.552
Oh, you must be Peter's wife, Lois.
I'm Larry.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.387
It's nice to meet you, Larry.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.932
Weird hands-full pinky shake?

13:28.684 --> 13:32.521
I got to tell you, it's so strange,
you look so much like Peter

13:32.604 --> 13:33.647
when I first met him.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.858
Well, I'm guessing
you look exactly the same, too.

13:35.941 --> 13:37.150
You're in such great shape.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.904
Well, I do have tiny blue weights
in my garage.

13:50.289 --> 13:53.041
- Oh. Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Lois. Is Peter here?

13:53.292 --> 13:55.169
Larry, it's only 2:00 in the afternoon.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.254
Peter's still sleeping off last
night's party.

13:57.588 --> 14:00.299
Then why... Why are you still
in your pajamas and bathrobe?

14:00.591 --> 14:02.676
Oh. That's because I'm depressed.

14:02.759 --> 14:06.513
Is that why that sad Shel Silverstein blob
is following you around?

14:06.597 --> 14:08.807
Who would ever fuck me?

14:09.391 --> 14:12.352
Anyway, we didn't really get a chance
to finish our conversation yesterday,

14:12.436 --> 14:14.605
and I thought maybe we could
grab some lunch together.

14:14.730 --> 14:17.649
Ah. That would give me a reason
to get dressed today.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.361
Oh, would you, uh, like to join us?

14:21.445 --> 14:24.281
That didn't sound like a real invitation.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.201
See. This is why no one
ever wants to fuck you.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.665
Thank you again for lunch, Larry.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.544
Sorry, I drew so many Nazi symbols
on the place-mat. I was just nervous.

14:37.628 --> 14:41.465
That's okay. I just wish
we hadn't gone to a kosher restaurant.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.426
Oh, look at me,
I got ice cream all over my fingers.

14:44.510 --> 14:48.096
- Do you have a napkin?
- No, but let me help you clean it off.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.983
Larry, are you turned on or starving?

15:00.317 --> 15:01.443
Can't it be both?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.667
Wow, Larry. That was unexpected.

15:16.792 --> 15:18.377
Shh. We'll discuss this later.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.337
- I have to get back to my high school.
- Oh.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.880
- Where I work.
- Oh.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.298
- As a janitor.
- Oh.

15:23.382 --> 15:25.592
- To pay for medical school.
- Oh.

15:25.676 --> 15:27.678
- That I'm building.
- Oh.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.513
- Out of Popsicle sticks.
- Oh.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.816
That big one doesn't blink a lot, does he?

15:41.358 --> 15:44.361
Hey, Lois, where's your purse? Me and
some of my kids are going to the movies.

15:44.653 --> 15:48.323
By the way, dwarf Peter died. I didn't
know what he ate, so I gave him nothing.

15:48.657 --> 15:50.325
His name was Tyler!

15:50.868 --> 15:51.952
He had a name.

15:52.035 --> 15:55.497
Everything you say, you say with pride.
I like that about you.

15:55.581 --> 15:57.666
Anyway, where's Larry?
Maybe he wants to go to the movie.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.836
Larry? Why would I know
where Larry is at?

16:00.961 --> 16:02.713
- Who is Larry?
- Oh, never mind.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.464
All right. Everybody bring your phones,

16:04.548 --> 16:07.134
so we can text each other
during the movie.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.723
Wow, you want to tell me what that was?

16:13.432 --> 16:16.560
Brian, Larry and I
sort of crossed the line yesterday.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.146
I don't know.
He's just so sweet and fun-loving.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.399
And for God's sake he looks just like
Peter did when he was his age.

16:22.649 --> 16:27.112
- Yeah. But?
- Well, he kissed me and I kind of let him.

16:27.196 --> 16:29.448
I told him it could never happen again
and I...

16:29.865 --> 16:31.325
- What are you doing?

16:31.408 --> 16:34.828
Oh, I thought that was kind of like,
"I'm open for business."

16:34.912 --> 16:37.664
No! I'm confiding in a friend.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.250
Oh, you're the safe friend.

16:40.584 --> 16:43.587
Look. I feel awful about it,
but I told Larry that was it,

16:43.670 --> 16:45.631
and we couldn't be anything
more than friends.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.342
- So, you're still going to see him?
- Yes, of course.

16:48.425 --> 16:51.136
He's a nice young man,
and he's practically family.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.304
Lois.

16:52.513 --> 16:54.890
No! Zoloft blob, don't!

17:02.940 --> 17:04.525
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.818
I'm fine.
I just hurt my neck this morning,

17:06.902 --> 17:09.279
vigorously nodding approval to Judge Judy.

17:09.613 --> 17:13.450
Okay. All right. The doctor is in.
Come on, back it up over here.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.327
Somebody's got a neck massage coming.

17:15.494 --> 17:16.578
Ah, right there.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.830
Okay. But let's keep this friendly.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.041
You can choke me for just a second.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.460
You know, maybe I should just go ahead
and do your whole back.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.671
Yeah, your bra strap
is getting in the way here.

17:25.754 --> 17:27.214
I'll just bite it off with my teeth.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.970
Lois, is a President stronger than a king?
What the hell?

17:33.053 --> 17:34.179
Oh. Peter...

17:34.388 --> 17:38.642
Look. Calm down. We're just friends.
He's just giving me a friendly massage.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.310
"A friendly massage"?

17:40.477 --> 17:42.062
Yeah. And what do you care?

17:42.229 --> 17:44.398
When's the last time
you did anything nice for me?

17:44.523 --> 17:46.859
I ate that gross pasta you made.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.652
I might as well just tell you, Peter.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.195
I'm in love with Lois.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.364
I knew it the moment we kissed.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.448
"Kissed"?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.826
- Is that true?
- Yes, Peter. But I...

17:55.909 --> 17:57.286
You son of a bitch!

18:10.299 --> 18:11.508
Ah!

18:21.518 --> 18:23.687
Everybody says,
"We don't need a home owners association.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.441
"That's stupid, Quagmire." Well, this is
why a home owners association.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.178
What the hell? Lois.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.598
What did you do that for? I thought you
and him were girlfriend and boyfriend.

18:59.932 --> 19:02.100
He was not my boyfriend, Peter.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.853
And I wasn't about to stand by
and watch him kick your ass.

19:04.937 --> 19:07.689
- I was holding my own there.
- You were getting beat up.

19:07.898 --> 19:10.734
No... No. I meant, I was holding
my own nuts, so he wouldn't kick 'em.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.278
But if he's not your boyfriend,
why did you kiss him?

19:13.362 --> 19:14.613
He kissed me.

19:15.197 --> 19:18.742
And I should have told you.
I'm sorry if hurt you, Peter.

19:19.535 --> 19:22.454
I guess Larry just reminded me
of a younger version you.

19:22.704 --> 19:26.708
And the truth is I liked
that he was paying me a little attention.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.460
The way you used to.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.588
Maybe I have been
taking you for granted.

19:32.214 --> 19:35.259
But I promise I'll make it up to you.
I'll be the best husband ever.

19:35.926 --> 19:37.219
You already are.

19:37.386 --> 19:39.137
For God sakes,
when push came to shove,

19:39.221 --> 19:42.641
you stood toe to toe with
a much younger man and fought for me.

19:42.724 --> 19:46.270
Oh, by the way, uh, thanks, all my kids,
for stepping in to help. Really...

19:46.436 --> 19:48.480
Really appreciate that.
But you're right, Lois.

19:48.564 --> 19:49.648
I'm going to change.

19:49.731 --> 19:52.192
I'm going to do all the stuff for you
that Larry was doing.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.862
No, Peter. I don't need any of that.

19:54.945 --> 19:57.281
At our age,
all I'm really looking for in a husband

19:57.406 --> 20:00.158
is someone who wants to watch TV with me
on a Saturday night,

20:00.242 --> 20:02.035
and isn't afraid to pop a zit on my back.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.496
"Afraid"? I love doing that.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.791
It's like bubble wrap you get
to have sex with every now and then.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.752
I got a pretty good one going right now,
Peter.

20:10.836 --> 20:13.755
You always do, Lois. I love you.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.511
<i>From that day forward,</i>

20:19.636 --> 20:24.057
<i>Peter and Lois never again... Oh, nope.</i>
<i>Sorry. There's still another scene left.</i>

20:28.604 --> 20:31.273
Well, Peter, turns out
your initial instinct was right.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.151
You never should have let
any of your children contact you.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.861
You said it. From now on,

20:35.944 --> 20:39.239
I'm making sure
my sperm stays right where it belongs.

20:39.323 --> 20:40.616
In the bathroom sink.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.470
We have fun down here.
