<i>Machinery.</i>

01:21.736 --> 01:23.067
<i>Machinery is correct.</i>

01:23.102 --> 01:25.234
<i>Now, which state produced
the most U.S. presidents?</i>

01:25.269 --> 01:26.234
Illinois.

01:26.269 --> 01:27.234
<i>Virginia.</i>

01:27.269 --> 01:28.501
<i>Virginia is correct.</i>

01:28.536 --> 01:30.334
<i>Which side of the brain</i>

01:30.369 --> 01:31.901
<i>controls
analytical thinking?</i>

01:31.936 --> 01:32.901
The right.

01:32.936 --> 01:33.901
<i>The left.</i>

01:33.936 --> 01:35.400
<i>The left is correct!</i>

01:35.435 --> 01:38.701

01:38.736 --> 01:40.033

01:40.068 --> 01:42.067
<i>Who do you call when
you don't want to cook?</i>

01:42.102 --> 01:43.334
Ahab's.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.167
<i>Ahab's is correct.</i>

01:45.202 --> 01:47.601
<i>Yes. Ahab's
for fish and fowl.</i>

01:47.636 --> 01:48.934
<i>Yes, opening soon</i>

01:48.969 --> 01:51.033

depressed area near you.</i>

01:52.502 --> 01:53.534
Daddy's home. Come on.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.901
Hi, honey. How was your day
at the shoe store?

02:01.936 --> 02:03.267
I'll tell you
something, Peg.

02:03.302 --> 02:05.968
Feet and the return
of warm weather

02:06.003 --> 02:08.434
sure makes for
a deadly combination.

02:09.834 --> 02:12.534
Well, you knew that
going in, Al.

02:12.569 --> 02:15.133
Yeah. My back is so tight.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.467
I wish I had
somebody to rub it.

02:19.502 --> 02:20.968
Like a wife.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.801
Hey, there's one now!

02:26.901 --> 02:28.400
How about my back?

02:28.435 --> 02:30.968
You know, Al, I work hard
all day too.

02:31.003 --> 02:32.300
Yeah? Doing what?

02:36.901 --> 02:37.801
Ahh!

02:39.300 --> 02:42.100
Ohh, that feels good.

02:42.135 --> 02:43.434
How good?

02:50.868 --> 02:52.367
Where are the kids?

02:52.402 --> 02:53.467
Upstairs.

02:53.502 --> 02:55.334
What if they come down?

02:55.369 --> 02:56.767
I'll take care of that.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.000
Bud, Kelly!

02:58.035 --> 03:00.868
You want to come down
and help me in the kitchen?

03:04.067 --> 03:06.868
There. That should
buy us about 10 minutes.

03:06.903 --> 03:09.434
Seven more
than we'll need.

03:13.534 --> 03:14.934
Where were we?

03:17.934 --> 03:19.000
We're here, Bundy!

03:21.734 --> 03:23.734
Bundy, Bundy,
don't you know

03:23.769 --> 03:26.467
you shouldn't leave
your door unlocked?

03:26.502 --> 03:29.868
It's an invitation
to intruders.

03:29.903 --> 03:31.901
What are they
doing here?

03:31.936 --> 03:34.968
They're the neighborhood watch.
I invited them.

03:35.003 --> 03:36.434
To watch this?!

03:37.667 --> 03:40.367
Uh, hi, Peggy. Al.

03:40.402 --> 03:42.634
I hope we're not
interrupting anything.

03:42.669 --> 03:45.734
Nah. Just gonna have
a little sex with the wife.

03:48.868 --> 03:51.267
What the heck.
There's always next month.

03:52.501 --> 03:54.734
Our house was robbed
this afternoon.

03:54.769 --> 03:58.033
Gee, that's too bad.
You wanna hand me my shirt?

03:58.068 --> 04:00.267
What did
they steal?

04:00.302 --> 04:02.000
Mostly small stuff.

04:02.035 --> 04:03.501
Our radio,
Marcie's earrings,

04:03.536 --> 04:05.501
our cameras,
our answering machine.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.868
God only knows
who called.

04:09.434 --> 04:12.334
Well, at least they didn't
take anything valuable.

04:12.369 --> 04:13.734
Yeah, this time.

04:13.769 --> 04:15.400
But I know how
these vermin think.

04:15.435 --> 04:16.733
They take your little crap,

04:16.769 --> 04:19.934
then come back later with
a truck for your big crap.

04:19.969 --> 04:21.934
Not gonna happen
in my house.

04:21.969 --> 04:23.234
I'm ready for them.

04:23.269 --> 04:25.868
I got 50,000 volts going
through my window bars.

04:25.903 --> 04:29.467
I got a bucket of battery acid
hanging over the back door

04:29.502 --> 04:32.334
and I got a.30-aught-6
rigged to the front doorknob.

04:32.369 --> 04:34.300
How do you get into
your house?

04:34.335 --> 04:36.133
Wouldn't you
like to know?

04:37.934 --> 04:40.067
Now, the question
before us is:

04:40.102 --> 04:42.801
What are we gonna
do about it?

04:42.836 --> 04:45.200
I say we hunt
the scum down,

04:45.235 --> 04:47.567
and then we run them over
with our cars.

04:47.602 --> 04:49.434
Then we get out
these fishhooks-

04:49.469 --> 04:50.434
Marcie!

04:50.469 --> 04:51.501
I'm sorry.

04:51.536 --> 04:54.634
I don't know
what came over me.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.834
It's just that
I feel violated.

04:56.869 --> 04:58.701
Someone's been in my home,
in my bedroom.

04:58.736 --> 05:00.167
I feel so helpless.

05:00.202 --> 05:04.334
We'd all feel helpless
in your bedroom, Marce.

05:04.369 --> 05:06.434
You got
any more beer?

05:06.469 --> 05:07.634
No.

05:07.669 --> 05:10.634
And in all the excitement,
I forgot to ask-

05:10.669 --> 05:13.534
Why are you meeting
in my house?

05:13.569 --> 05:16.667
Because our wives
didn't want you in ours.

05:16.702 --> 05:20.033
Hi. Did I
miss anything?

05:20.068 --> 05:23.067
You want me
back on my wife?

05:23.102 --> 05:24.434
Not on my account.

05:24.469 --> 05:26.501
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry you got robbed.

05:26.536 --> 05:28.100
It wasn't me.
It was them!

05:28.135 --> 05:29.501
Yeah, it was you.

05:29.536 --> 05:31.234
Somebody smashed
your car windshield,

05:31.269 --> 05:32.467
stole your radio,

05:32.502 --> 05:35.067
and wrote "wash me"
on your hood.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.267
My car!
They stole my radio?

05:37.302 --> 05:39.100
Hey, Bundy.
The thieves have a point.

05:39.135 --> 05:40.734
You really ought
to wash your car.

05:40.769 --> 05:42.501
Get out!

05:43.801 --> 05:44.968
Out! Out!

05:45.003 --> 05:48.000
Pretend there's a keg
on the lawn.

05:48.035 --> 05:48.968
Out! Out!

05:52.634 --> 05:55.501
I can't believe
they stole my radio

05:55.536 --> 05:57.367
right in front
of my house!

05:57.402 --> 05:58.834
I know how you feel.

05:58.869 --> 06:01.434
If you did, Steve,
you wouldn't be touching me.

06:01.469 --> 06:03.868
Maybe we should
get more involved

06:03.903 --> 06:05.467
with the
neighborhood watch.

06:05.502 --> 06:07.901
Look. You can't depend
on anybody but yourself.

06:07.936 --> 06:09.567
I've put this off long enough.

06:09.602 --> 06:11.267
I'm buying a gun.

06:11.302 --> 06:12.968
A gun is not the answer.

06:13.003 --> 06:15.467
You can't curtail
the criminal element

06:15.502 --> 06:17.367
by sinking
to their level.

06:17.402 --> 06:19.467
Oh, excuse me,
Miss Let's-run-them-over

06:19.502 --> 06:21.567
and-get-out
the-fishhooks.

06:21.602 --> 06:23.901
I was upset.
I wasn't thinking clearly.

06:23.936 --> 06:25.901
Yes. She wasn't
using the left,

06:25.936 --> 06:27.601
or analytical,
portion of the brain.

06:30.167 --> 06:33.067
I'm definitely
getting a gun.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.767
And I'd advise you
to do the same.

06:34.802 --> 06:37.868
Now, come on. There's got
to be a more humane way

06:37.903 --> 06:39.767
to protect our home
and possessions.

06:39.802 --> 06:40.901
There is.

06:40.936 --> 06:43.534
We'll get a dog.
A good watch dog.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.734
A dog. That's a great idea.
I've got a dog.

06:46.769 --> 06:49.400
Buck, look!
Strangers in the house!

06:49.435 --> 06:52.501
Kill them, Buck.
Go kill them!

06:52.536 --> 06:54.667
Whoa, big fella.

06:54.702 --> 06:57.400
I don't mean
a stupid dog.

06:57.435 --> 06:59.968
I'm talking
about a real dog.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.434
A guard dog.

07:01.469 --> 07:02.434
A Doberman.

07:02.469 --> 07:03.934
Steve,
first thing tomorrow,

07:03.969 --> 07:07.367
we're going to one of
those deadly doggy places.

07:07.402 --> 07:09.467
Yes, Al, because
we're against guns

07:09.502 --> 07:11.968
and the violence
they stand for.

07:12.003 --> 07:13.968
That's right. A dog.

07:14.003 --> 07:16.601
A vicious dog
with sharp teeth

07:16.636 --> 07:18.534
that will go
through a jugular

07:18.569 --> 07:21.467
like a hot knife cutting through
butter on a warm, summer night-

07:21.502 --> 07:22.801
Come along, dear.

07:22.836 --> 07:25.434
So that the next guy who tries
to get in my bedroom uninvited

07:25.469 --> 07:28.000
will walk out
on bloody stumps.

07:30.736 --> 07:32.601
When was the last time
you called

07:32.636 --> 07:34.734
to complain
about the dog?

07:34.769 --> 07:37.167
Yesterday. But Marcie
said to stop calling.

07:37.202 --> 07:39.000
She said the ringing
makes him bark.

07:39.035 --> 07:41.267
Everything
makes him bark.

07:41.302 --> 07:43.000
Hey, Dad, it's been
two weeks,

07:43.035 --> 07:45.234
and you haven't even
let me see the gun yet,

07:45.269 --> 07:47.100
let alone pick off
a pigeon or two.

07:47.135 --> 07:50.567
Bud, guns are not toys.
They are lethal weapons

07:50.602 --> 07:53.567
and should only be handled
by responsible adults.

07:53.602 --> 07:55.801
When Dad was practicing
his quick draws

07:55.836 --> 07:57.400
<i>at the TV
during Donahue-</i>

07:57.435 --> 07:59.467
Bud, number one,
shut up.

07:59.502 --> 08:01.801
Number two,
it was Phil's salute

08:01.836 --> 08:05.033
to the Huge and Fat
Women's Caucus.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.968
Number three, there
were no bullets in the gun.

08:08.003 --> 08:11.000
Your mother took them out
and hid them for safety reasons,

08:11.035 --> 08:12.567
and she won't tell me where.

08:12.602 --> 08:13.767
Guns, guns, guns.

08:13.802 --> 08:16.434
Can't anyone talk
about me for a change?

08:16.469 --> 08:19.534
Okay, Kelly.
Where were you last night?

08:19.569 --> 08:22.801
So, Dad, what kind
of gun did you buy?

08:25.536 --> 08:26.601
Coming!

08:33.000 --> 08:34.868
Hi, Peg.

08:34.903 --> 08:37.467
Borrow
a cup of kibble?

08:37.501 --> 08:40.433
We ran out, and
the dog's still hungry.

08:40.469 --> 08:41.667
What's the matter?

08:41.702 --> 08:44.467
The neighbor's cat
didn't fill him up?

08:44.502 --> 08:47.601
That cat was
taunting him, Al.

08:47.636 --> 08:50.133
Gee, you two
look cute.

08:50.168 --> 08:54.367
I can't get Al
to dress unisex at all.

08:54.402 --> 08:56.067
This is protective gear.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.968
You see, Bella still
hasn't accepted us

08:58.003 --> 08:59.501
as his rightful owners.

08:59.536 --> 09:02.167
You named that dog
after Bela Lugosi?

09:02.202 --> 09:04.400
No. Abzug.

09:04.435 --> 09:07.033
We thought
it was kind of cute.

09:07.068 --> 09:10.000
But he won't
wear the hat.

09:10.035 --> 09:11.601
Oh, listen Al,
by the way,

09:11.636 --> 09:14.400
we want to apologize
about your fence.

09:14.435 --> 09:15.767
What happened
to my fence?

09:15.802 --> 09:16.968
Bella ate
through it.

09:17.003 --> 09:18.501
Wow!

09:18.536 --> 09:19.834
It was just
a little piece.

09:19.869 --> 09:21.200
Yeah, not much, really.

09:21.235 --> 09:23.601
About the size
of a human face.

09:23.636 --> 09:26.601
Rhoades, what are we
going to do about this?

09:26.636 --> 09:29.133
Look, we'll handle this
the same way

09:29.168 --> 09:31.634
we dealt with
the cat incident.

09:31.669 --> 09:33.634
Get estimates,
and we'll make it good.

09:33.669 --> 09:36.100
Look, we know Bella
can be loud and annoying,

09:36.135 --> 09:39.000
and the whole neighborhood
hates his guts,

09:39.035 --> 09:40.834
but at least
he's a good protector.

09:40.869 --> 09:43.901
Gee, Mom, that's just
what you say about Dad.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.801
Mount up! They just
hit the Johnsons.

09:48.836 --> 09:50.501
TV and major appliances.

09:50.536 --> 09:53.501
We're meeting
at the Bowl and Brew

09:53.536 --> 09:55.100
to calm
ourselves down.

09:55.135 --> 09:56.501
Ha! See that!

09:56.536 --> 09:58.501
They didn't
hit our place.

09:58.536 --> 10:02.200
That's what a good dog
will do for you.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.033
Come on.
Grab the meal and the mace.

10:05.068 --> 10:07.367
It's time
to feed our doggy.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.074

10:20.968 --> 10:23.534
Peg, did you
hear that?

10:23.569 --> 10:26.901
How could I hear anything
the way you snore?

10:29.669 --> 10:31.167
What was that?

10:31.202 --> 10:32.534
I don't know.

10:33.569 --> 10:35.534
Don't worry.
I'll go check.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.033
No, Al!
Call the police.

10:37.068 --> 10:38.067
For noise?

10:38.102 --> 10:41.033
It might be a burglar.
Call the police.

10:42.501 --> 10:44.901
I can't.
Kelly's on the phone.

10:46.567 --> 10:47.968
What are you doing?

10:48.003 --> 10:49.234
Getting my gun.

10:49.269 --> 10:51.100
You gonna tell me
where you hid the bullets,

10:51.135 --> 10:52.634
or are you gonna wait
till the kids

10:52.669 --> 10:53.767
see our pictures
in the paper?

10:53.802 --> 10:55.567
Come on, Al.
I had to hide the bullets

10:55.602 --> 10:57.067
so Bud wouldn't find them.

10:57.102 --> 10:58.133
Where are they?

10:58.168 --> 11:00.033
They're in
the finger holes

11:00.068 --> 11:01.767
of your new
bowling ball.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.534
Oh, this is real easy, Peg.

11:06.569 --> 11:08.734
This is much better
than keeping them handy.

11:08.769 --> 11:12.767
Even an axe-wielding maniac
deserves an even break.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.067
Hurry, Al!

11:14.102 --> 11:15.868
Where's Buck?
Shouldn't he be barking?

11:15.903 --> 11:17.067
I don't know.

11:20.734 --> 11:23.501
You shiftless,
worthless, dirty...

11:35.767 --> 11:38.167
Peg, stay at the top
of the stairs.

11:38.202 --> 11:39.868
If anything happens,

11:39.903 --> 11:41.767
get the kids,
lock yourself in a room.

11:41.802 --> 11:45.267
And if Kelly's off the phone,
call the police.

11:48.334 --> 11:50.801
It's coming
from the patio.

11:50.836 --> 11:51.934
Oh, be careful.

11:51.969 --> 11:52.834
I will.

12:05.033 --> 12:05.934
Aah!

12:17.434 --> 12:19.767
Okay, creep!
I see you!

12:19.802 --> 12:22.367
Freeze,
or I'll shoot!

12:24.168 --> 12:26.901
Oh, my God! Al! Al!

12:26.936 --> 12:28.267
Oh!

12:30.200 --> 12:32.067
Al, are you
all right?

12:32.102 --> 12:33.167
Yeah.

12:33.202 --> 12:34.667
What happened
out there?

12:36.400 --> 12:39.167
I just shot Steve
and Marcie's dog.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.634
How could you
shoot a dog?

12:49.669 --> 12:51.767
He didn't look
like a dog, Peg.

12:51.802 --> 12:54.467
All I seen were these
two yellow eyes

12:54.502 --> 12:57.133
staring at me from the bushes
and I told him to freeze,

12:57.168 --> 12:59.868
and then I thought it
made a move at me

12:59.903 --> 13:01.567
and I panicked.

13:01.602 --> 13:04.267
You couldn't tell the
difference between a dog

13:04.302 --> 13:05.901
and a human being?

13:05.936 --> 13:07.701
He was wearing a hat.

13:10.868 --> 13:11.968
Kelly, honey,

13:12.003 --> 13:14.567
I was trying
to protect our family.

13:14.602 --> 13:15.667
That's right.

13:15.702 --> 13:17.467
Dad did a good thing.

13:17.502 --> 13:19.634
Can I go out
and see the body?

13:19.669 --> 13:20.934
You're disgusting.

13:20.969 --> 13:24.200
And you're failing
five classes.

13:24.235 --> 13:25.467
Hey, hey,
kids.

13:25.502 --> 13:27.067
Listen to me.

13:27.102 --> 13:30.033
We can all learn
something from this.

13:30.068 --> 13:31.133
What, Dad?

13:31.168 --> 13:33.601
I don't know.
Go to bed.

13:33.636 --> 13:34.968
Aw, Dad!

13:35.003 --> 13:36.467
I wouldn't argue
with him, Bud.

13:36.502 --> 13:38.367
He's already
killed once tonight.

13:39.767 --> 13:41.868
You were
very brave, Al.

13:41.903 --> 13:43.133
Aww...

13:43.168 --> 13:46.801
Wasn't anything
that anybody else

13:46.836 --> 13:49.200
with the heart of a lion
wouldn't have done.

13:49.235 --> 13:50.534
I mean,
you should've seen me.

13:50.569 --> 13:51.834
Yeah, I was
a little nervous,

13:51.869 --> 13:54.934
but I got him right
between the eyes,

13:54.969 --> 13:57.801
and I'll tell you, there's not a
lot of space between those eyes.

14:01.968 --> 14:04.367
It was
a nice shot, Al.

14:04.402 --> 14:06.868
You want to go
upstairs?

14:06.903 --> 14:07.801
Yeah.

14:12.802 --> 14:15.934
You don't suppose
that's Steve and Marcie?

14:15.969 --> 14:17.634
Peggy, Al,
it's us!

14:17.669 --> 14:19.934
It's them. What are you
gonna tell them?

14:19.969 --> 14:22.400
I don't know.
But if they don't bring it up,

14:22.435 --> 14:24.234
we don't bring it up.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.467
Hey! Steve and Marcie.

14:29.502 --> 14:32.968
What brings you two
crazy kids over here?

14:33.003 --> 14:34.467
We heard a shot.

14:34.502 --> 14:35.968
Peg, look who's here.

14:36.003 --> 14:38.734
It's Steve and Marcie
from next door.

14:38.769 --> 14:40.667
They heard a shot, Peg.

14:42.133 --> 14:44.968
Are you going
to say anything tonight, Peg?

14:45.003 --> 14:48.934
Uh...what was that
you came over here for?

14:48.969 --> 14:50.934
We thought we heard
a shot, Al.

14:50.969 --> 14:52.934
They thought they
heard a shot, Peg.

14:52.969 --> 14:54.634
Did you hear a shot?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.734
Say something, Peg!

14:57.769 --> 15:00.234
I think if there
had been a shot,

15:00.269 --> 15:02.634
their dog would have
started barking.

15:07.434 --> 15:11.100
Look, guys, I'm really sorry
about that barking.

15:11.135 --> 15:13.100
Oh, hey, forget
about that.

15:13.135 --> 15:15.601
Listen, we're friends
and neighbors here.

15:15.636 --> 15:19.300
We're not gonna let some
stupid dog come between us.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.801
Why isn't
Bella barking?

15:20.836 --> 15:24.434
I haven't heard him
in a while.

15:24.469 --> 15:26.067
Al, tell them.

15:26.102 --> 15:27.100
Okay.

15:28.534 --> 15:30.467
See...

15:30.502 --> 15:33.467
I tell you,
I really love you guys.

15:33.502 --> 15:36.334
Do you love me,
huh?

15:37.634 --> 15:39.133
Well...sure, Al.

15:39.168 --> 15:40.467
You know...

15:40.502 --> 15:42.501
Not really.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.000
Tell them, Al.

15:46.035 --> 15:47.934
I'm not going
to tell them anything

15:47.969 --> 15:50.868
till they tell me
they love me.

15:50.903 --> 15:52.400
What's
going on here?

15:52.435 --> 15:53.567
All right.

15:53.602 --> 15:54.901
Okay.

15:54.936 --> 15:58.300
But you got to promise me
that you'll let me finish.

15:58.335 --> 15:59.767
Sure, Al.

15:59.802 --> 16:01.968
I shot your dog.

16:03.767 --> 16:04.801
I'm finished.

16:08.267 --> 16:09.434
Bella!

16:09.469 --> 16:10.434
Is he...

16:10.469 --> 16:11.601
Alive?

16:11.636 --> 16:12.767
Yes.

16:12.802 --> 16:13.801
No.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.267
Where is he?

16:17.302 --> 16:19.267
He's out in my yard.

16:19.302 --> 16:20.767
You can't miss him.

16:20.802 --> 16:22.133
I didn't.

16:24.601 --> 16:26.133
You stay here.

16:26.168 --> 16:27.734
I'm gonna check on Bella.

16:27.769 --> 16:30.200
You shot my puppy.

16:30.235 --> 16:31.701
Look, I'm sorry.

16:31.736 --> 16:33.667
We had a prowler
stalking our yard.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.701
Your dog came
to my defense.

16:35.736 --> 16:39.133
The burglar, he took a shot
at me, and I fired back

16:39.168 --> 16:41.133
and poor Bella
got in the way

16:41.168 --> 16:43.634
and was killed
in the crossfire.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.634
We only heard one shot.

16:45.669 --> 16:47.634
It was
a simultaneous exchange.

16:47.669 --> 16:49.133
I don't know.

16:49.168 --> 16:50.634
It happened so fast.

16:50.669 --> 16:52.200
It's all a blur.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.000
You shot my dog

16:59.035 --> 17:01.868
in the middle
of a bowel movement?

17:08.733 --> 17:10.666
Steve, is he
really dead?

17:10.702 --> 17:11.834
Yes, dear.

17:11.868 --> 17:13.334
How do you know?

17:13.368 --> 17:16.334
Number one, he didn't respond
to any of my commands.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.501
And number two,

17:17.536 --> 17:19.701
his brains are
in the begonias.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.267
You killer!

17:24.301 --> 17:26.534
Anyone for cake
or coffee?

17:28.166 --> 17:30.467
Now, listen.
I said that I was sorry.

17:30.502 --> 17:32.133
Let me make it
up to you.

17:32.168 --> 17:33.501
Let me get you
another dog.

17:33.536 --> 17:35.200
For what,
target practice?

17:35.235 --> 17:37.734
We told them not
to get a gun.

17:37.769 --> 17:40.667
We told you not
to get a gun.

17:40.702 --> 17:43.200
But you had to go out
and be Mr. Macho.

17:43.235 --> 17:45.300
Now you've taken
an innocent life.

17:45.335 --> 17:47.567
Now, wait a second.
This is not a defense,

17:47.602 --> 17:49.067
but that dog was
anything but innocent.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.734
I mean, he bit you.
He ate a cat.

17:51.769 --> 17:54.667
Given enough time,
he'd have robbed a bank.

17:54.702 --> 17:56.334
How much you
want for him?

17:56.369 --> 17:58.133
$1,000.

17:58.168 --> 18:02.133
$1,000 for a dog
that just sat there

18:02.168 --> 18:04.934
and let me
shoot him?

18:04.969 --> 18:07.000
You want to
get off cheap,

18:07.035 --> 18:08.467
next time,
go plug a squirrel.

18:08.502 --> 18:09.634
All right!

18:09.669 --> 18:11.133
Forget the money.

18:11.168 --> 18:14.000
You know what I want?

18:14.035 --> 18:17.000
Yes, I do,
and you're too late.

18:17.035 --> 18:19.133
Peg's already got him.

18:19.168 --> 18:20.634
Your gun, Al.

18:20.669 --> 18:22.801
Give me your gun.

18:22.836 --> 18:24.334
All right!

18:24.369 --> 18:27.334
I want to take it and throw it
in the Chicago river,

18:27.369 --> 18:29.801
so it'll never
hurt anyone again.

18:29.836 --> 18:30.901
Here.

18:34.167 --> 18:37.367
And from now on,
we're just neighbors.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.400
Now I know why we got
our house so cheap.

18:45.701 --> 18:48.367
Well, that's done.
Where were we?

18:48.402 --> 18:50.167
We were going
upstairs...

18:51.300 --> 18:52.334
Deadeye.

18:56.467 --> 18:57.968
Well, all done.

18:58.003 --> 19:00.834
Old Bella's on his way
to the landfill.

19:04.133 --> 19:08.033
It cost me $20 and a six-pack
for the garbage man.

19:08.068 --> 19:10.567
You'd think the dollar
I give him at Christmas

19:10.602 --> 19:12.033
would be enough.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.100
Yeah. Oh, by the way,

19:14.135 --> 19:15.501
I washed
your killing clothes.

19:15.536 --> 19:17.501
Have a nice day,
honey.

19:26.501 --> 19:27.667
Hi.

19:27.702 --> 19:28.834
Hi, Al.

19:28.869 --> 19:30.200
Uh, listen, uh...

19:31.501 --> 19:33.000
Some words were said
last night,

19:33.035 --> 19:35.501
and I just wanted you to know
we talked it over,

19:35.536 --> 19:38.000
and we understand
you didn't do it on purpose.

19:38.035 --> 19:40.801
You didn't do it
on purpose, did you, Al?

19:42.501 --> 19:45.033
Steve,
I'm a pet owner myself.

19:45.068 --> 19:48.467
Anyway, we decided to let it go
and forgive you.

19:48.502 --> 19:49.968
Thanks, buddy.

19:50.003 --> 19:53.968
So I guess if you'll just
give me Bella's body,

19:54.003 --> 19:56.968
we can forget
about the whole thing.

19:57.003 --> 20:00.234
We want to give him
a decent burial

20:00.269 --> 20:03.234
you know, in our yard
under that big tree

20:03.269 --> 20:05.234
where he did
his business.

20:05.269 --> 20:08.234
Except, of course,
for that last one.

20:08.269 --> 20:11.734
Gee, I don't know
what to say, Steve. Uh...

20:11.769 --> 20:14.067
Yes, I do.
I can't let you do it.

20:14.102 --> 20:15.634
See, Peg and I
talked it over

20:15.669 --> 20:18.334
and we realized
that since I'm at fault,

20:18.369 --> 20:19.734
I should handle
everything.

20:19.769 --> 20:22.701
So let me take care
of all the arrangements, huh?

20:22.736 --> 20:24.501
Well, if it'll make
you feel better,

20:24.536 --> 20:26.133
I guess that would
be all right.

20:26.168 --> 20:27.367
Marcie will like that.

20:27.402 --> 20:29.767
We'll do it tonight
after work.

20:29.802 --> 20:31.133
See you then.

20:33.267 --> 20:34.934
Thanks, big guy.

20:34.969 --> 20:35.968
Oh, uh...

20:38.601 --> 20:40.267
Listen, uh...

20:40.302 --> 20:42.767
Can you bury him
with this?

20:42.802 --> 20:45.300
He really loved
this bone.

20:50.234 --> 20:51.234
Sure, buddy.

20:56.434 --> 20:57.601
Hey, Peg!

20:57.636 --> 20:59.100
I'm late for work.

20:59.135 --> 21:01.601
Can I ask you
to do me a little favor?

21:17.934 --> 21:19.200
How much
for the crate?

21:19.235 --> 21:20.667
$150.

21:20.702 --> 21:22.701
$150?!

21:22.736 --> 21:25.567
Al, I didn't have time
to comparison-shop.

21:30.968 --> 21:33.801
Now I'd like
to say a few words

21:33.836 --> 21:36.567
about the dearly
departed.

21:36.602 --> 21:38.067
As you know,

21:38.102 --> 21:42.067
Bella was more than a dog
to Marcie and me.

21:42.102 --> 21:43.567
He was family.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.567
One of us.

21:45.602 --> 21:47.067
Bella
will be missed,

21:47.102 --> 21:50.234
but his death
was not in vain.

21:50.269 --> 21:53.334
He taught us about
the value of life

21:53.369 --> 21:55.501
and that guns
and violence

21:55.536 --> 21:59.067
are not the answer
to society's ills.

22:00.534 --> 22:03.534
And we can take consolation
in the knowledge

22:03.569 --> 22:07.534
that while he only lived
one year in dog's years,

22:07.569 --> 22:10.534
he lived seven
in people years.

22:10.569 --> 22:12.934
What a great job.

22:12.969 --> 22:15.167
I got to
hand it to you.

22:15.202 --> 22:17.300
That box even
feels heavy enough

22:17.335 --> 22:19.467
to have a dog in it.

22:19.502 --> 22:21.534
What did you put
in there anyway?

22:21.569 --> 22:24.400
Some rocks and
your bowling ball.

22:28.167 --> 22:30.534
But knowing
that he's...

22:30.569 --> 22:31.868
right here...

22:31.903 --> 22:34.400
in the back yard,

22:34.435 --> 22:37.534
where he was
so happy,

22:37.569 --> 22:41.434
makes us all feel
a little less grief.
