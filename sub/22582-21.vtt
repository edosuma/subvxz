00:09.885 --> 00:11.716
- Feeding time?
- When isn't it?

00:16.605 --> 00:18.755
- What is that?
- It won't bite.

00:19.085 --> 00:20.757
It's called a tribble.

00:20.885 --> 00:24.355
It was extremely difficult to acquire.
They're outlawed on most worlds.

00:24.485 --> 00:26.919
- Why? Is it dangerous?
- Far from it.

00:27.725 --> 00:31.001
All it's capable of doing, really,
is eating and breeding.

00:31.405 --> 00:34.203
The problem is,
they breed quite prodigiously.

00:40.805 --> 00:43.319
The only thing that keeps
their population in check...

00:43.445 --> 00:45.834
is the abundance of reptiles
on their homeworld.

00:46.485 --> 00:48.316
Are you feeling all right, Ensign?

00:50.085 --> 00:52.315
I just came by
to give you this transmission.

00:52.445 --> 00:56.074
It's from the Denobulan
Science Academy. Marked urgent.

00:56.325 --> 00:57.474
Thank you.

01:07.845 --> 01:10.405
It's been a long road

01:11.925 --> 01:15.076
Gettin' from there to here

01:15.205 --> 01:18.003
It's been a long time

01:18.805 --> 01:22.275
But my time is finally near

01:22.765 --> 01:26.155
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:27.005 --> 01:29.838
I will touch the sky

01:30.285 --> 01:33.880
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:34.005 --> 01:36.997
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:37.125 --> 01:41.403
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:41.605 --> 01:44.642
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:44.765 --> 01:48.917
I've got faith to believe

01:49.045 --> 01:52.003
I can do anything

01:52.125 --> 01:55.800
I've got strength of the soul

01:56.485 --> 01:59.477
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:59.605 --> 02:03.757
I can reach any star

02:04.925 --> 02:06.916
I've got faith

02:08.805 --> 02:11.956
I've got faith

02:12.445 --> 02:15.721
Faith of the heart

02:36.885 --> 02:40.480
- These caverns go on for 50 kilometres.
- They've mapped 50 kilometres.

02:40.605 --> 02:43.199
No one knows exactly
how far they extend.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.516
What were your scientists
doing down there?

02:45.645 --> 02:48.239
This cave system is known
for its mineral formations.

02:48.365 --> 02:50.959
The speleothems are supposed to be
particularly unusual.

02:51.085 --> 02:52.837
They've been underground
for six months.

02:52.965 --> 02:56.560
The Denobulan Science Academy
lost contact with them three weeks ago.

02:56.925 --> 02:58.916
The planet's called Xantoras.

02:59.365 --> 03:02.596
The government's been
politically unstable for several years.

03:02.725 --> 03:05.558
In the last few weeks,
a militant faction has taken control.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.835
They're demanding
that all off-worlders leave.

03:07.965 --> 03:11.401
Anyone who fails to comply could face
imprisonment, or possibly worse.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.085
Why don't the Denobulans
evacuate their own scientists?

03:14.205 --> 03:17.595
They can't get here in time.
Enterprise is less than a day away.

03:17.885 --> 03:20.080
We've been asked to pick them up.

03:22.005 --> 03:23.961
First we have to find them.

03:25.245 --> 03:26.883
You've had some caving experience.

03:27.005 --> 03:29.997
There are some steep inclines here,
but I think I can handle it.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.274
What about you and Malcolm?

03:31.405 --> 03:34.203
Don't worry, Captain.
I'm sure Travis is an excellent teacher.

03:34.325 --> 03:36.361
- Get some gear together.
- Aye, sir.

03:36.805 --> 03:40.275
I realise this was
an unusual request, Captain.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.358
I want to thank you.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.318
Happy to help, Doctor.

03:56.805 --> 03:58.523
- Pitons.
- All here.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.320
- Ration packs?
- A week's worth.

04:01.965 --> 04:04.957
- Flex-cable.
- Five hundred metres.

04:06.725 --> 04:08.238
Waste disposal units.

04:11.645 --> 04:15.115
- What are these for?
- We take out everything we bring in.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.359
I just spoke
to the Xantoras Regional Governor.

04:25.725 --> 04:27.283
He's issued a general order.

04:27.445 --> 04:30.039
You have to get them out of there
in three days.

04:31.045 --> 04:32.603
That's not much time.

04:32.925 --> 04:36.474
The military's preparing search patrols
to arrest any stray off-worlders...

04:36.605 --> 04:38.323
when the deadline arrives.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.754
If you haven't found them
in a day and a half...

04:40.885 --> 04:43.080
I want you to turn around
and head back.

04:43.885 --> 04:45.159
No arguments here.

04:56.605 --> 04:57.754
What's the problem?

04:57.885 --> 05:01.036
One of the transports leaving the planet
just declared an emergency.

05:01.165 --> 05:03.076
Their reactor casing's ruptured.

05:03.285 --> 05:06.322
The Captain's asking the Xantoras
for permission to go back down.

05:06.445 --> 05:07.958
Can you put it on speaker?

05:08.085 --> 05:11.043
Several compartments have flooded
with radiation.

05:11.165 --> 05:13.554
I have injured passengers and crew.

05:13.765 --> 05:16.677
Your request has been denied.
Leave orbit immediately.

05:17.085 --> 05:19.041
Our situation is critical!

05:19.525 --> 05:22.597
We're tracking your vessel.
If you attempt to land, we will...

05:22.725 --> 05:27.003
- Where are they?
- In a low orbit, 600 kilometres below us.

05:28.085 --> 05:29.484
Set a course.

05:30.325 --> 05:31.280
Open a channel.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.797
I want to speak to their captain.

05:41.765 --> 05:45.075
There could be internal bleeding.
Run a haemostatic scan.

05:46.765 --> 05:50.997
Treat these with dermalin gel. Give him
two cc's of anaprovaline for the pain.

05:51.285 --> 05:53.003
You're going to be fine.

05:53.765 --> 05:56.484
He was working near the reactor
when it ruptured.

06:00.565 --> 06:03.841
- Doctor?
- Get him into the lmaging Chamber.

06:29.365 --> 06:30.514
What have you got?

06:31.045 --> 06:33.275
Nothing but three humans...

06:33.805 --> 06:37.354
one of which is not entirely convinced
we're going in the right direction.

06:37.485 --> 06:38.838
Make that two.

06:38.965 --> 06:41.354
This is the nearest entrance
to their campsite.

06:41.645 --> 06:44.000
I'd be willing to bet they came this way.

06:59.045 --> 07:02.117
Watch your footing.
There's a lot of loose rock.

07:05.565 --> 07:07.521
The last cave I was in had handrails...

07:07.965 --> 07:10.320
a gift shop, a snack bar.

07:13.605 --> 07:14.754
There's an opening.

07:14.885 --> 07:16.034
Over here.

07:35.325 --> 07:38.317
- Still willing to bet they came this way?
- Yes, sir.

07:39.565 --> 07:41.840
Isn't there a beginners' cliff
we can start on?

07:42.285 --> 07:44.003
Don't worry. I'll go first.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.643
- How's it going?
- These two are doing well.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.803
His injuries were more extensive.

08:23.005 --> 08:25.360
His body absorbed
a heavy dose of radiation.

08:25.685 --> 08:27.198
I've stabilised him for now...

08:27.325 --> 08:29.964
but he's going to need
intra-cellular regeneration.

08:34.525 --> 08:35.719
What are his chances?

08:35.845 --> 08:39.042
It's a complex procedure, but I'd say
the odds are in his favour.

08:40.965 --> 08:42.193
Where am I?

08:42.845 --> 08:46.155
You're on my ship, Enterprise.
I'm Captain Archer.

08:46.805 --> 08:48.033
What happened?

08:48.525 --> 08:50.834
There was an accident
on your transport.

08:53.885 --> 08:55.443
What's he doing here?

08:57.885 --> 08:59.000
He's our doctor.

08:59.725 --> 09:01.158
Keep him away from me.

09:02.205 --> 09:05.720
- You need his help.
- I'd rather die than be treated by him.

09:15.205 --> 09:18.003
Our two species
have a complicated history.

09:19.085 --> 09:22.077
We've gone to war with the Antarans
on several occasions.

09:22.485 --> 09:23.554
Recently?

09:24.005 --> 09:27.315
On the contrary, it's been 300 years
since our last conflict.

09:28.245 --> 09:30.315
And there's still bad blood
between you?

09:30.805 --> 09:33.399
They've been
particularly bitter disputes.

09:36.125 --> 09:39.162
If you explain to him
that he won't survive without your help...

09:39.365 --> 09:41.879
maybe he'd set the past aside
for a few hours.

09:42.005 --> 09:44.565
I seriously doubt it.
He insisted I leave the room.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.882
I don't think you realise
how much "bad blood" there is.

09:49.285 --> 09:52.004
You could always sedate him
and perform the treatment.

09:52.405 --> 09:56.318
- I have to respect his wishes.
- Even if he wishes to die?

09:57.285 --> 10:01.119
The will of the patient is the cornerstone
of Denobulan medical ethics.

10:01.245 --> 10:03.361
Don't you believe
if you can help someone...

10:03.485 --> 10:06.841
- you're ethically bound to do so?
- Hippocrates wasn't Denobulan.

10:06.965 --> 10:08.717
This is an Earth ship, Doctor.

10:09.685 --> 10:12.882
I won't let that man die in my Sickbay
if it can be prevented.

10:13.005 --> 10:15.439
Without his consent,
there is nothing I can do.

10:18.525 --> 10:20.436
I'm giving you an order.

10:21.485 --> 10:25.080
I'm sorry, Captain, but I'm afraid
I can't follow it.

10:40.685 --> 10:42.880
- Watch your footing, sir.
- Thanks.

10:46.325 --> 10:47.883
- Travis!
- Stay calm.

10:51.965 --> 10:53.637
Commander, are you all right?

10:54.205 --> 10:55.843
Just testing the rope.

11:22.165 --> 11:24.838
Why don't you take a break?
I'll see what's below.

11:57.965 --> 11:59.114
What's that?

12:07.205 --> 12:08.877
I think it's Denobulan.

12:09.285 --> 12:12.004
I've seen characters like these
in Phlox's medical books.

12:16.285 --> 12:19.721
You don't suppose Denobulans
carry out everything they bring in?

12:26.325 --> 12:27.724
Rock samples.

12:30.885 --> 12:33.035
Looks like we're on the right track.

12:40.565 --> 12:41.759
How are you feeling?

12:42.565 --> 12:44.203
I'd like to return to my ship.

12:44.885 --> 12:47.353
Your ship was damaged
by the reactor leak.

12:47.925 --> 12:50.439
It'll be a few days
before you can go back aboard.

12:52.245 --> 12:54.554
You were exposed
to high levels of radiation.

12:55.685 --> 12:57.038
You need treatment.

12:57.325 --> 12:59.395
I prefer to be treated
by another physician.

12:59.525 --> 13:01.243
If you don't let Phlox operate...

13:02.285 --> 13:04.196
you won't survive more than two days.

13:04.725 --> 13:07.717
I understand there's a troubled history
between your peoples...

13:07.845 --> 13:10.359
but I can assure you,
Phlox is an excellent doctor.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.476
Our history is much more
than "troubled."

13:12.605 --> 13:15.403
Did your doctor tell you
that their battle tactics resulted...

13:15.525 --> 13:17.880
in 20 million Antaran casualties?

13:19.485 --> 13:22.079
- He wasn't that specific.
- I imagine not.

13:22.365 --> 13:25.323
They've been very successful
at putting it behind them.

13:34.245 --> 13:37.840
Do you want to become
a casualty of a war...

13:38.405 --> 13:40.361
that ended 300 years ago?

13:41.245 --> 13:44.237
Phlox has been my Chief
Medical Officer for nearly two years.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.680
I've never questioned his skill,
or his integrity.

13:47.845 --> 13:50.040
It's quite possible
he's a proficient surgeon...

13:50.165 --> 13:51.962
but I don't intend to find out.

13:52.925 --> 13:53.960
You'd rather die?

13:54.085 --> 13:57.873
I'm the first Antaran to even see
a Denobulan in six generations.

13:58.605 --> 14:02.803
If you spent some time with him,
it might change your perception of them.

14:03.645 --> 14:07.684
A few hours in our historical archives
might change yours.

14:08.685 --> 14:12.155
I prefer to make my judgments
based on first-hand experience.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.843
I respect your history...

14:20.085 --> 14:22.315
and the sacrifice your people made.

14:23.205 --> 14:24.684
But I can tell you...

14:25.485 --> 14:29.114
that the Denobulans you're describing
are not the people I've met.

14:29.805 --> 14:32.842
Don't sacrifice your life
based on preconceptions.

14:35.925 --> 14:37.756
Why haven't you ever mentioned this?

14:37.885 --> 14:39.318
It wasn't our proudest moment...

14:39.445 --> 14:42.198
but we've done our best
to put it behind us.

14:43.765 --> 14:46.438
Do you know you're the first Denobulan
he's ever met?

14:46.685 --> 14:49.074
And he is the first Antaran I've ever met.

14:49.205 --> 14:50.797
Doesn't that seem odd to you?

14:50.965 --> 14:52.603
That in 300 years...

14:53.485 --> 14:55.476
neither side has tried to reconcile?

14:57.405 --> 15:00.238
Maybe you put it behind you too quickly.

15:01.605 --> 15:04.039
As I said before,
the situation is complicated.

15:06.525 --> 15:10.643
From childhood, every Antaran is taught
that Denobulans are enemies...

15:11.125 --> 15:12.922
to be feared, reviled.

15:14.645 --> 15:17.034
This is your chance
to prove them wrong.

15:17.565 --> 15:20.682
- I doubt I could.
- Set aside your preconceptions.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.077
I made some headway with him...

15:23.405 --> 15:25.794
but I won't be the one
holding the scalpel.

15:26.445 --> 15:28.163
Show him that he can trust you.

15:28.285 --> 15:31.038
Do you believe I can earn his trust
in less than 36 hours?

15:31.165 --> 15:32.996
All I'm asking is that you try.

15:33.285 --> 15:36.277
Your ethics might keep you
from treating him against his will...

15:36.405 --> 15:38.714
but nothing's stopping you
from talking to him.

15:38.845 --> 15:39.800
You're a doctor.

15:40.285 --> 15:41.434
He's your patient.

15:41.645 --> 15:43.317
Find a way to help him.

16:00.445 --> 16:01.798
Toss a coin?

16:04.725 --> 16:07.922
- They went that way.
- How can you tell?

16:08.725 --> 16:10.078
Look at those.

16:11.285 --> 16:14.083
If I was a geologist,
that's the way I would go.

16:28.685 --> 16:30.516
Stay close to the wall.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.482
I don't have much choice.

16:52.205 --> 16:54.321
- It's getting steeper.
- Let me lock off.

16:54.645 --> 16:56.317
Check your safety, Commander.

18:07.405 --> 18:08.997
I can't reach it!

18:27.525 --> 18:30.597
- Almost!
- I can't hold this much longer.

18:31.525 --> 18:33.436
Stand by! We'll try again.

18:34.045 --> 18:36.195
Let's swing together. You ready?

18:37.285 --> 18:38.240
On three.

18:39.685 --> 18:40.720
One...

18:45.045 --> 18:46.080
two...

18:49.405 --> 18:50.520
three!

18:50.645 --> 18:52.363
The rope's slipping!

19:05.885 --> 19:07.000
We're all right!

19:23.365 --> 19:24.684
Is it broken?

19:26.445 --> 19:27.480
Yes.

19:27.685 --> 19:29.596
You tore a couple of ligaments, too.

19:33.365 --> 19:36.596
We need to keep moving.
Just give me something for the pain.

19:42.045 --> 19:44.764
Sorry, Travis.
You're not going anywhere.

19:46.445 --> 19:48.117
I can make it, sir.

19:49.325 --> 19:52.920
We're already behind schedule, Ensign.
We can't have you slowing us down.

19:55.685 --> 19:57.323
Thanks for getting us this far.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.720
You'll be all right.

20:02.605 --> 20:06.280
Respectfully, sir, it's not me
that I'm worried about.

20:08.925 --> 20:10.722
Give me some light on this, Malcolm.

20:34.805 --> 20:38.514
- What are you doing?
- Checking your bio-signs. Nothing else.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.438
Very diligent.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.273
What a dedicated healer you must be.

20:46.685 --> 20:48.482
You're a long way from home.

20:49.245 --> 20:52.715
- What brought you here?
- Practicing your bedside manner?

20:54.165 --> 20:56.121
I enjoy a good challenge.

20:57.685 --> 20:59.721
You haven't answered my question.

21:00.045 --> 21:02.275
I'm a teacher of xenomythology.

21:02.965 --> 21:06.162
I study the legends of alien species.

21:06.645 --> 21:09.000
I imagine the diverse population
on this planet...

21:09.125 --> 21:11.514
has made it ideal for your research.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.284
Enterprise is here to pick up
three Denobulan scientists.

21:14.405 --> 21:18.114
They also found this world
uniquely suited to their fieldwork.

21:18.245 --> 21:20.884
How delightful that we have
so much in common.

21:23.485 --> 21:26.841
- Why do you want to save my life?
- I'm a doctor.

21:27.965 --> 21:32.117
Do you believe saving one Antaran will
assuage your guilt for killing millions?

21:32.325 --> 21:33.917
I haven't killed anyone.

21:34.445 --> 21:36.595
Now you finally have your chance.

21:37.245 --> 21:39.839
I assure you, the regeneration
procedure is quite safe.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.398
If you'll allow me to proceed...

21:41.525 --> 21:44.085
You must know a great deal
about our anatomy...

21:45.045 --> 21:47.240
after what your doctors did to us.

21:52.285 --> 21:55.800
Tell me, were you raised
listening to stories about my people?

21:56.125 --> 21:58.685
The evil Antarans.
Did they give you nightmares?

21:58.805 --> 22:01.558
I could ask you the same question
about my people.

22:01.685 --> 22:04.518
- Do you have children, Doctor?
- Why?

22:04.645 --> 22:06.761
Did you tell those stories to them?

22:06.885 --> 22:10.036
Did you teach them to hate Antarans
just like you were taught?

22:10.165 --> 22:12.042
My children have nothing to do with this.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.280
Don't they?

22:13.605 --> 22:15.436
If they were here right now...

22:15.565 --> 22:17.999
what would they think
about their father...

22:18.125 --> 22:20.320
- talking to an Antaran?
- Enough!

22:20.445 --> 22:22.675
Would you even let them
in the same room with me?

22:22.805 --> 22:26.400
I've tried to treat you with respect,
but I refuse to listen to these insults.

22:26.525 --> 22:29.039
You're the reason we're unable
to put the past behind us!

22:29.165 --> 22:30.439
You've kept this hatred alive.

22:30.565 --> 22:33.284
No Denobulan would want
to be in the same room with you!

22:59.285 --> 23:00.479
May I join you?

23:01.365 --> 23:04.243
Actually, I'm not in the mood
for company, Subcommander.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.516
Wait. I'm sorry.

23:08.605 --> 23:10.357
- Sit down.
- Lf you wish to be alone...

23:10.485 --> 23:11.838
Sit, please.

23:16.325 --> 23:18.964
How are the repairs
to the transport coming?

23:19.245 --> 23:21.600
Slowly. The damage was extensive.

23:22.845 --> 23:24.164
How is your patient?

23:25.325 --> 23:27.885
Dying, but that seems to be his wish.

23:29.765 --> 23:31.164
That's unfortunate.

23:33.685 --> 23:36.643
I've had patients refuse
treatment before...

23:36.765 --> 23:39.279
but usually in the final stages
of an illness.

15:27:22.210 --> 23:44.365
[Skipped item nr. 284]

23:44.365 --> 23:46.959
It's painful to admit,
but I understand why.

23:51.165 --> 23:53.804
When I was quite young,
I wanted to take a trip...

23:53.925 --> 23:56.678
to an arboreal planet near our system.

23:56.805 --> 24:01.321
It was a park of sorts,
with a great variety of exotic animal life.

24:02.485 --> 24:05.443
Some friends and I planned
the journey for months...

24:05.565 --> 24:07.283
but the week before I was to leave...

24:07.405 --> 24:09.043
one of my grandmothers
took me aside...

24:09.165 --> 24:11.633
- and told me I couldn't go.
- Why not?

24:11.885 --> 24:15.514
She said the planet was tainted.
Antarans had lived there once.

24:15.645 --> 24:17.442
Even though
they'd been gone for years...

24:17.565 --> 24:19.920
she believed the place
had been spoiled...

24:20.045 --> 24:21.444
by their presence.

24:22.765 --> 24:23.914
Did you go?

24:26.165 --> 24:27.154
No.

24:28.525 --> 24:31.358
But when I had children of my own,
I took them there.

24:32.085 --> 24:34.883
I was determined not to raise them
as I was raised.

24:35.005 --> 24:37.200
Your children are fortunate
to have a father...

24:37.325 --> 24:39.520
who taught them to embrace
other cultures.

24:42.245 --> 24:43.883
I certainly tried.

24:48.205 --> 24:49.604
Are you all right?

24:51.285 --> 24:53.753
Thanks for your company. Good night.

25:06.285 --> 25:07.877
Can you see anything?

25:11.125 --> 25:12.558
More of the same.

25:14.565 --> 25:16.874
Are you sure this is the way they came?

25:17.805 --> 25:19.716
I didn't see any other passage.

25:19.845 --> 25:22.643
We'll give it another half-hour,
then we're turning back.

25:25.165 --> 25:27.474
Three bio-signs. Denobulan.

25:27.965 --> 25:30.479
- How far?
- About 50 metres.

26:08.845 --> 26:09.914
Who are you?

26:10.045 --> 26:13.003
Commander Tucker of the Starship
Enterprise. This is Lieutenant Reed.

26:13.245 --> 26:15.042
Hope you won't think I'm rude...

26:15.165 --> 26:17.633
but there are many
other caverns here to explore.

26:18.005 --> 26:18.960
We're not geologists.

26:19.085 --> 26:21.474
The Denobulan Science Academy
asked us to find you.

26:21.605 --> 26:22.799
- Why?
- The Xantoras.

26:22.925 --> 26:25.120
They've given all off-worlders
three days to leave...

26:25.245 --> 26:26.280
and that was two days ago.

26:26.405 --> 26:27.838
Then you'd better hurry.

26:27.965 --> 26:29.080
You don't understand.

26:29.205 --> 26:31.036
We've been ordered
to take you out of here.

26:31.165 --> 26:32.837
We've got hard climbing ahead of us...

26:32.965 --> 26:35.115
so decide how much of this gear
you can do without.

26:35.245 --> 26:38.555
We're sorry you came all this way,
but we're not leaving.

26:48.925 --> 26:50.483
We're not leaving without you.

26:50.925 --> 26:53.200
You've warned us
about the situation, Commander.

26:53.325 --> 26:55.680
- You've accomplished your mission.
- Not quite.

26:55.925 --> 26:59.315
Your Science Academy will hold us
responsible if we come back alone.

26:59.565 --> 27:03.114
If the Academy knew the progress we're
making, they'd never have sent you.

27:03.245 --> 27:04.234
You don't get it.

27:04.365 --> 27:07.038
When the Xantoras find you,
they'll throw you in prison.

27:07.165 --> 27:08.518
They may even execute you.

27:08.645 --> 27:11.557
All the more reason for us to stay
down here where we're safe.

27:11.685 --> 27:13.403
You can't stay here forever.

27:13.525 --> 27:16.358
I doubt we'll need to. The government
changes hands so often...

27:16.485 --> 27:19.124
everything will probably be resolved
by the time we're done.

27:19.245 --> 27:20.678
I realise your work is important...

27:20.805 --> 27:22.796
but you can't risk your lives
for these rocks.

27:22.925 --> 27:23.960
Rocks?

27:24.085 --> 27:27.839
This is the most remarkable collection
of speleothems we've ever seen.

27:27.965 --> 27:31.037
There's calcite, aragonite,
botyroidal flowstone.

27:31.405 --> 27:34.442
I've spent 14 years
searching for tractosites this perfect.

27:34.765 --> 27:36.676
These samples could provide clues...

27:36.805 --> 27:39.763
to prevent seismic disasters
on Denobula.

27:41.725 --> 27:44.637
- How much longer do you need?
- Two weeks, maybe three.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.274
Three weeks?

27:48.605 --> 27:50.243
I've spent the last two days...

27:50.365 --> 27:53.960
falling down cliffs and getting stuck
in lava tubes, all just to find you.

27:54.085 --> 27:56.997
I've got an injured man waiting,
and we have just enough time...

27:57.125 --> 28:00.515
to get out of here before we end up
in front of a Xantoras firing squad.

28:00.645 --> 28:02.636
My orders are to bring you back...

28:02.765 --> 28:05.154
and I promise you
that's what I'm going to do.

28:05.285 --> 28:08.083
- You can't force us to leave.
- Want to bet?

28:08.885 --> 28:12.036
We didn't risk our lives to hear you
say, "Thanks, but no thanks."

28:12.165 --> 28:15.077
Pack up whatever you need,
because I swear, I'll tie you up...

28:15.205 --> 28:17.958
and drag you out by your ankles
if that's how you want it.

28:18.565 --> 28:20.999
We have a lot of samples.
We'll need your help.

28:21.125 --> 28:22.194
Fine.

28:29.645 --> 28:32.113
I'd prefer to spend
my last few days alone.

28:33.205 --> 28:34.524
That's your decision.

28:34.725 --> 28:37.285
But if my knowledge
of Antaran lifespans is correct...

28:37.405 --> 28:39.714
your "last days"
won't come for about 60 years.

28:40.285 --> 28:41.718
What are you talking about?

28:41.845 --> 28:45.360
Once the intra-cellular regeneration
is complete, you should be able to...

28:45.485 --> 28:46.474
I refused your treatment.

28:46.605 --> 28:48.561
I need to take you
off the pain medication...

28:48.685 --> 28:50.004
before I begin the procedure.

28:50.125 --> 28:51.638
Get away from me.

28:51.765 --> 28:55.440
I was told your principles prevented
you from treating me against my will.

28:55.565 --> 28:57.954
Or don't your ethics apply to Antarans?

29:02.005 --> 29:04.155
- I did have nightmares.
- What?

29:04.725 --> 29:08.320
You asked me if I had heard stories
as a child about the Antarans.

29:09.525 --> 29:11.914
My grandmother lived
through the last war.

29:12.885 --> 29:16.594
I would lay in my bed at night,
thinking about her stories...

29:16.725 --> 29:20.320
terrified that one of those evil Antarans
would climb through my window.

29:20.685 --> 29:23.279
I hope your confession makes you
feel better, Doctor...

29:23.405 --> 29:24.918
but it doesn't change a thing.

29:26.045 --> 29:29.560
You also asked me
if I had children. I have five.

29:30.045 --> 29:32.957
And no, I never told them
my grandmother's stories.

29:34.165 --> 29:35.917
When they asked me
about the Antarans...

29:36.045 --> 29:38.559
I told them the truth,
as best as I knew it.

29:38.685 --> 29:42.041
I told them about our military campaigns
against your people...

29:42.405 --> 29:45.477
about how we had demonised you,
turned you into a faceless enemy.

29:45.605 --> 29:48.961
I wanted them to learn to judge people
for what they really are...

29:49.445 --> 29:51.879
not what the propaganda tells them.

29:52.285 --> 29:54.594
How would you know who we really are?

29:56.485 --> 29:57.520
I don't.

29:58.085 --> 30:00.076
But I am proud to say that my children...

30:00.205 --> 30:02.560
would consider my grandmother's
attitude archaic.

30:04.245 --> 30:05.758
All of them but one.

30:07.925 --> 30:10.075
We've grown more open-minded
since the last war...

30:10.205 --> 30:12.355
but there are still Denobulans
who fear Antarans.

30:12.485 --> 30:13.713
Even hate them.

30:13.845 --> 30:17.121
My youngest son, Mettus,
was seduced by those people.

30:17.245 --> 30:19.315
I did my best to convince him
he was mistaken.

30:19.445 --> 30:22.437
I told him I wouldn't tolerate
the values he was embracing.

30:22.725 --> 30:24.363
It created a rift between us.

30:25.765 --> 30:27.835
Maybe I didn't do enough to reach him.

30:29.365 --> 30:31.640
The last time we spoke
was nearly 10 years ago.

30:34.125 --> 30:37.834
You wanted to know what my children
would think if they were here now.

30:38.725 --> 30:41.000
I can tell you what Mettus would think.

30:41.485 --> 30:44.045
He would be happy
to have me grant your request...

30:45.045 --> 30:46.364
and let you die.

30:47.205 --> 30:50.277
But that is not the example
I tried to set for my children.

30:52.365 --> 30:53.593
Why not live...

30:56.245 --> 30:57.883
and set an example for yours?

31:23.125 --> 31:25.002
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

31:25.165 --> 31:26.644
Then keep moving.

31:29.765 --> 31:32.484
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.

31:32.965 --> 31:34.193
Come on, let's go.

31:34.325 --> 31:37.317
- I just need a moment.
- We don't have a moment.

31:39.845 --> 31:41.278
What are you doing up there?

31:42.765 --> 31:44.164
Are those rock samples?

31:45.965 --> 31:47.603
We can't carry any more.

31:47.725 --> 31:50.683
It took us six weeks to extract these
from the rock bed.

31:50.845 --> 31:53.154
If you don't start moving
in the next five seconds...

31:53.285 --> 31:56.083
I'm going to take my phase-pistol
and shoot you in the ass.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.524
These are priceless.

31:57.645 --> 31:59.476
One, two...

32:04.685 --> 32:05.720
Go!

32:28.565 --> 32:30.556
Could be some kind of seismic activity.

32:30.885 --> 32:32.443
Feels like weapons fire to me.

32:36.085 --> 32:38.076
Pretty high-yield by the sound of it.

32:39.365 --> 32:41.595
We've still got two hours
till the deadline.

32:42.485 --> 32:44.441
You better get your climbing gear on.

32:45.365 --> 32:47.640
We don't have any climbing gear.

32:48.445 --> 32:52.723
You mean to tell us that you climbed
down that rock face without any ropes...

32:53.645 --> 32:56.239
- any safety equipment at all?
- Exactly.

32:57.885 --> 32:59.398
In that case, after you.

33:07.445 --> 33:09.197
Get against the wall!

33:21.325 --> 33:23.316
- Everyone all right?
- I'm fine.

33:23.445 --> 33:24.480
Yes.

33:24.685 --> 33:27.324
Let's keep moving
before we get trapped down here.

33:31.965 --> 33:33.000
Captain.

33:33.125 --> 33:35.480
- Is that the Governor?
- He says his time is precious.

33:35.605 --> 33:36.754
So is mine.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.325
Captain Archer,
I thought I'd made myself clear.

33:40.445 --> 33:43.994
You did, which makes me wonder
why you're attacking my people.

33:44.245 --> 33:45.280
What do you mean?

33:45.405 --> 33:48.681
One of your patrols has opened fire
in the vicinity of the caves.

33:48.885 --> 33:50.796
Your general order
doesn't go into effect...

33:50.925 --> 33:52.358
for another hour and a half.

33:52.485 --> 33:56.239
I assure you, they're not targeting
your crewmen, or the Denobulans.

33:56.845 --> 34:00.599
- Then who are they shooting at?
- Soldiers from the previous regime.

34:01.085 --> 34:03.679
They've refused to accept
the shift in power.

34:04.165 --> 34:07.635
That's not my concern.
You're endangering my people.

34:08.205 --> 34:10.241
You've got to wait
until they're in the clear.

34:10.364 --> 34:12.400
I'm afraid that's impossible.

34:12.525 --> 34:14.163
It's what we agreed to.

34:14.605 --> 34:17.563
We agreed to give you three days.
Nothing more.

34:21.445 --> 34:24.243
Target the patrol
that's firing at those caves.

34:26.245 --> 34:28.600
If you attack us, we'll retaliate.

34:28.725 --> 34:31.683
- We're locked on to the coordinates.
- Charge weapons.

34:31.925 --> 34:34.359
Do you really want to be
at war with us, Captain?

34:34.485 --> 34:36.998
The question is, do you want
to be at war with us?

34:37.125 --> 34:39.480
Sounds like you've got
your hands full already.

34:40.125 --> 34:41.797
Stick to our original agreement...

34:41.925 --> 34:44.199
and you won't find yourself
fighting on two fronts.

35:04.485 --> 35:07.318
Commander, the bombing seems
to have stopped.

35:09.965 --> 35:12.479
We need to get out of here
before it starts up again.

35:20.925 --> 35:22.358
You wanted to see me?

35:22.765 --> 35:25.120
What you said, about your son.

35:26.725 --> 35:30.195
You seemed sincere in your desire
to set an example for your children.

35:30.725 --> 35:32.716
I wish more Denobulans felt that way.

35:34.685 --> 35:35.879
Many do.

35:36.925 --> 35:40.201
- Perhaps, if you met more of us...
- It seems unlikely.

35:42.925 --> 35:44.802
Is that all you wanted to say to me?

35:45.605 --> 35:47.914
You made me think
about my own family.

35:49.525 --> 35:51.197
I have children as well.

35:54.565 --> 35:56.760
I've decided to accept your treatment.

36:12.405 --> 36:14.680
- My speleothems!
- Forget about them.

36:15.165 --> 36:17.884
Fortunately, I have some other samples
in my case.

36:22.325 --> 36:23.599
Try them again.

36:27.205 --> 36:28.797
Enterprise to Commander Tucker.

36:30.205 --> 36:31.320
Please respond.

36:36.645 --> 36:37.873
Prep Shuttlepod One.

36:38.445 --> 36:41.118
Have a security team meet me
in the launch bay.

36:41.285 --> 36:43.674
The Xantoras have mobilised
their military patrols.

36:43.805 --> 36:45.636
- They'll detect a shuttle launch.
- Noted.

36:45.765 --> 36:47.164
Tucker to Enterprise.

36:50.765 --> 36:54.314
You're cutting it pretty close, Trip.
The deadline passed two hours ago.

36:54.725 --> 36:56.397
Better late than never.

36:56.525 --> 36:58.436
- The Denobulans?
- All aboard.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.555
Along with some very rare speleothems.

37:03.245 --> 37:07.284
Captain, there's a small craft closing
on the shuttlepod. It's a patrol ship.

37:07.605 --> 37:08.594
You've got company, Trip.

37:08.765 --> 37:11.677
I see them. Bearing 184 mark 2-7.

37:19.445 --> 37:21.959
Minimal damage. They're using
low-power particle beams.

37:22.645 --> 37:24.124
- Do you need assistance?
- Stand by.

37:24.245 --> 37:26.964
I think they're just trying to give us
a kick in the pants.

37:37.285 --> 37:38.479
How is he?

37:38.605 --> 37:41.677
He'll be a bit groggy when he comes
out of the anaesthesia...

37:41.805 --> 37:44.319
but the procedure was successful.

37:47.245 --> 37:48.997
I'm glad you didn't defy my orders.

37:50.805 --> 37:53.717
I wasn't looking forward
to throwing you in irons.

37:54.845 --> 37:56.073
Neither was I.

37:57.365 --> 37:58.798
How did you convince him?

38:00.285 --> 38:04.358
You must be familiar with the principle
of doctor-patient confidentiality.

38:05.765 --> 38:08.120
Of course, you could always
order me to tell you.

38:14.965 --> 38:16.557
Dr Phlox wanted to see you off...

38:16.685 --> 38:18.516
but he's busy treating
one of my crewmen...

38:18.645 --> 38:20.875
- who was injured on the surface.
- That's all right.

38:21.005 --> 38:23.473
The doctor and I spent
more than enough time together.

38:25.045 --> 38:28.242
It's too bad your research on Xantoras
was cut short.

38:28.685 --> 38:31.438
The time I spent on your ship
was an education in itself.

38:31.565 --> 38:32.998
Thank you for your help.

38:35.925 --> 38:39.713
You do know we came here
to rescue three Denobulan geologists?

38:40.485 --> 38:41.634
Phlox told me.

38:42.205 --> 38:44.878
I understand they'll be heading home
on your transport.

38:45.045 --> 38:46.956
I hope that won't be a problem.

38:47.925 --> 38:50.997
Have they been informed
that I'll be travelling with them?

38:51.325 --> 38:54.203
- I had a talk with them.
- And what was their response?

38:54.565 --> 38:55.634
They're willing...

38:56.245 --> 38:57.200
if you are.

39:27.845 --> 39:29.676
Computer, begin recording.

39:32.085 --> 39:35.998
Dear Mettus, I know it's been some time
since I've written...

39:37.085 --> 39:40.202
and I know chances are slim
that you'll respond to this letter.

39:40.845 --> 39:41.914
However...

39:43.245 --> 39:45.281
something has happened
that compels me...

39:45.725 --> 39:47.397
to try to reach you again.

39:48.965 --> 39:52.958
I've had an experience
that has opened many old wounds.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.324
As painful as it's been...

39:57.205 --> 39:59.400
it's also changed something in me.

40:01.365 --> 40:03.959
I hope, if you're willing to listen...

40:05.085 --> 40:07.474
it might begin to change
something in you.
