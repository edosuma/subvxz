00:00.964 --> 00:02.063
Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:02.065 --> 00:03.598
When are you going back to Uruguay?

00:03.600 --> 00:05.567
I am going to tell the hospital tomorrow

00:05.569 --> 00:08.069
and help them find
and train a replacement.

00:08.071 --> 00:09.704
Paige Collins, 
will you marry me?

00:09.706 --> 00:10.705
Yes!

00:10.707 --> 00:11.739
So when did you ask my dad?

00:11.741 --> 00:13.141
I don't want to marry him.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.642
I want to marry you.

00:14.644 --> 00:17.178
Look, it's bad enough
my daughter's in love with ya.

00:17.180 --> 00:19.047
But can't all this just wait until

00:19.049 --> 00:20.815
after the campaign is over?

00:20.817 --> 00:25.053
I have spent too long standing
in for her at photo ops,

00:25.055 --> 00:27.455
and dinners, and book signings.

00:27.457 --> 00:29.357
Now it's time to protect mom.

00:29.359 --> 00:30.625
Why didn't you tell Hank
that you're doing shifts

00:30.627 --> 00:31.926
at the hospital?

00:31.928 --> 00:33.328
I was going to, but then I thought,

00:33.330 --> 00:34.329
"why burden him?"

00:35.398 --> 00:37.398
Then go home and get some rest.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.467
Of course I'll take an extra shift.

00:39.469 --> 00:40.602
Mr. Kassabian is diabetic, so...

00:40.604 --> 00:42.770
No oral or I.V. steroids. Yeah, yeah.

00:42.772 --> 00:44.105
We will send him back to you

00:44.107 --> 00:45.139
just the way we found him.

00:45.141 --> 00:46.941
I have your steroid treatment here.

00:46.943 --> 00:48.343
Great, thanks.

00:48.345 --> 00:49.511
I'll get you a prescription

00:49.513 --> 00:51.212
for some oral steroids as well.

00:51.214 --> 00:53.014
Eric!

00:59.421 --> 01:02.190
Yeah, this is Dr. Lawson,
I'm at 1 Cayne Court

01:02.192 --> 01:05.994
with a 35-year-old male
in acute diabetic ketoacidosis.

01:05.996 --> 01:11.366
He was mistakenly given oral steroids.

01:11.368 --> 01:13.401
He's tachycardic and unresponsive.

01:13.403 --> 01:15.803
I'm intubating, giving 500 CCs of saline

01:15.805 --> 01:17.338
and checking his glucose level.

01:21.544 --> 01:23.811
This is gonna hurt, Eric.

01:40.462 --> 01:42.430
- There you are.
- Yeah, sorry I'm late.

01:42.432 --> 01:43.798
It's okay.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.200
Your latte foam may be a bit petrified,

01:46.202 --> 01:47.869
but I am fine.

01:47.871 --> 01:49.938
Good, somebody oughta be.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.539
Uh-oh.

01:51.541 --> 01:52.574
You wanna talk about it?

01:52.576 --> 01:55.677
No.

01:55.679 --> 01:58.079
Therapy's a crock.

01:58.081 --> 02:01.149
You know how it's supposed
to be you on a journey to you?

02:01.151 --> 02:02.784
It's not. It's you on a journey

02:02.786 --> 02:04.786
to what your therapist thinks of you.

02:04.788 --> 02:06.254
I don't know...

02:06.256 --> 02:07.555
I mean she thinks I'm using
an incomplete relationship

02:07.557 --> 02:09.223
with Hank to tether myself here,

02:09.225 --> 02:12.427
thereby subconsciously
sabotaging my job in Uruguay.

02:12.429 --> 02:13.428
She said that?

02:13.430 --> 02:15.229
Basically.

02:15.231 --> 02:17.832
What did she say?

02:17.834 --> 02:20.868
She asked me if I ever
let my personal life interfere

02:20.870 --> 02:24.405
with my professional life.

02:24.407 --> 02:26.574
God...

02:26.576 --> 02:29.043
She's right, isn't she?

02:29.045 --> 02:30.078
You know, it's not for me...

02:30.080 --> 02:31.479
I mean, I can't deny it.

02:31.481 --> 02:33.147
I found an amazing replacement,

02:33.149 --> 02:36.584
I've got my dream job
in Uruguay just sitting there,

02:36.586 --> 02:40.188
and yet... I'm still sitting here.

02:40.190 --> 02:41.389
- Why?
- Well, maybe you're...

02:41.391 --> 02:44.525
I have to end it.

02:44.527 --> 02:47.762
Maybe I do.

02:47.764 --> 02:50.665
Maybe you're right.

02:50.667 --> 02:53.001
- About?
- Hank.

02:53.003 --> 02:56.604
I have to break up with him.

02:56.606 --> 02:59.273
And sooner rather than later.

02:59.275 --> 03:01.876
Otherwise, I am just leading him on.

03:01.878 --> 03:05.113
Leading us on, and...

03:05.115 --> 03:08.583
it's not right.

03:08.585 --> 03:11.653
Thank you for talking me through that.

03:11.655 --> 03:12.654
What are friends for?

03:12.656 --> 03:15.790
Oh!

03:15.792 --> 03:17.458
Jill Casey.

03:17.460 --> 03:18.926
Diabetic in acute D.K.A.,

03:18.928 --> 03:21.429
G.C.S. 13, intubated in the field,

03:21.431 --> 03:22.497
ran fluids wide open...

03:22.499 --> 03:23.765
Dr. Lawson, what do we got here?

03:23.767 --> 03:25.099
For you? Nothing. Go ahead.

03:25.101 --> 03:27.435
Whoa, hey, same team.
Good guys, remember?

03:27.437 --> 03:28.903
You know what I remember?

03:28.905 --> 03:29.871
Briefing you specifically
on that patient,

03:29.873 --> 03:31.472
yet here he is again.

03:31.474 --> 03:33.174
What, you're telling me
someone landed in the E.R.

03:33.176 --> 03:34.208
for a second time?

03:34.210 --> 03:36.010
Allow me to alert the media.

03:36.012 --> 03:37.011
Go ahead, laugh it up.

03:37.013 --> 03:38.279
If he dies, it's your ass.

03:38.281 --> 03:39.480
Okay, calm down.

03:39.482 --> 03:41.215
You don't want to have an aneurysm.

03:41.217 --> 03:43.184
You're right, that'd risk
getting you as my doctor.

03:43.186 --> 03:44.552
All right, outta my way.

03:44.554 --> 03:46.154
Not until you promise
to stay away from my patient.

03:46.156 --> 03:47.355
He stopped being your patient

03:47.357 --> 03:48.489
when he came through those doors.

03:48.491 --> 03:50.058
Now move it, housecall.

03:50.060 --> 03:51.826
- Like hell I will.
- Hey, hey, hey.

03:51.828 --> 03:53.094
What is going on here?

03:53.096 --> 03:55.029
He gave oral steroids to a diabetic

03:55.031 --> 03:56.431
and put the man in a coma.

03:56.433 --> 03:58.099
- You're insane.
- You're incompetent.

03:58.101 --> 04:00.735
Okay, that's enough. Both of you.

04:00.737 --> 04:02.537
This is a hospital. You wanna fight?

04:02.539 --> 04:04.672
You take it to an Irish pub
where fights belong.

04:04.674 --> 04:07.642
Dr. Van Dyke, I am sure
you have patients to see.

04:07.644 --> 04:09.310
And Dr. Lawson, if you have a complaint,

04:09.312 --> 04:10.845
I'll accept it in writing.

04:10.847 --> 04:14.348
Do I make myself clear?

04:14.350 --> 04:17.385
- Yep.
- Good.

04:20.689 --> 04:22.523
Listen, Hank,

04:22.525 --> 04:24.425
if there is a problem, I will find it

04:24.427 --> 04:25.893
and I will deal with it.

04:25.895 --> 04:27.228
But you cannot come in here

04:27.230 --> 04:29.363
accusing our doctors of incompetence.

04:29.365 --> 04:31.399
Not unless you have any proof.

04:31.401 --> 04:34.736
Yeah? Well, I got a whole bottle.

Sync and corrected by atrn97g
www.addic7ed.com

05:20.108 --> 05:21.509
Did he die?

05:21.511 --> 05:22.877
No, no.

05:22.879 --> 05:26.113
He's... he's stabilized,
but still in a coma.

05:28.450 --> 05:31.352
There's nothing you can do, Hank.

05:31.354 --> 05:34.255
That's why I'm frustrated, Evan.

05:34.257 --> 05:36.390
'Cause once he passed into that E.R.,

05:36.392 --> 05:37.658
he stopped being Eric Kassabian.

05:37.660 --> 05:39.627
He just became room number four.

05:39.629 --> 05:42.963
And all anyone cared about
was moving the meat.

05:42.965 --> 05:44.165
"Moving the meat"?

05:44.167 --> 05:45.933
Patients.

05:45.935 --> 05:48.235
In the E.R., patients are "the meat."

05:48.237 --> 05:51.205
Doctors there aren't exactly
known for their sensitivity.

05:51.207 --> 05:53.541
Huh.

05:53.543 --> 05:56.544
Year and a half ago,
you were one of those doctors.

05:56.546 --> 06:00.815
You kinda crossed over
to the other side, hmm?

06:00.817 --> 06:02.783
Yeah.

06:02.785 --> 06:04.585
Yeah, I guess I have.

06:06.354 --> 06:09.390
Can I ask your opinion on
something much less important?

06:09.392 --> 06:10.825
Please.

06:10.827 --> 06:12.426
Be good to get my mind
off life-and-death stuff.

06:12.428 --> 06:13.994
Actually it's about me
and the general golfing,

06:13.996 --> 06:16.130
so death's not completely off the table.

06:16.132 --> 06:19.500
Um, pink or yellow?

06:19.502 --> 06:21.802
Hmm...

06:21.804 --> 06:24.238
- Yellow.
- Thank you!

06:24.240 --> 06:25.606
- So, pink it is.
- What?

06:25.608 --> 06:26.807
All right!

06:26.809 --> 06:28.375
So, where are you off to anyway?

06:28.377 --> 06:30.744
Oh, I got a desperate call
from a party planner

06:30.746 --> 06:32.480
coordinating some insanely elaborate

06:32.482 --> 06:34.281
and elaborately insane event tomorrow.

06:34.283 --> 06:36.550
Tomorrow? And it's insane and elaborate?

06:36.552 --> 06:38.185
Dude, that must be
"A Farewell to Barnes."

06:38.187 --> 06:39.687
It must be a fare-what to where now?

06:39.689 --> 06:41.722
Gregg and Audrey Barnes,
philanthropist couple

06:41.724 --> 06:44.058
slash high-end
garden store entrepreneurs,

06:44.060 --> 06:46.627
are throwing the divorce party
to end all divorce parties.

06:46.629 --> 06:47.862
A divorce party?

06:47.864 --> 06:49.196
That sounds ludicrous
even for the Hamptons.

06:49.198 --> 06:50.564
No, it's cool,
they're taking all the money

06:50.566 --> 06:51.999
that would have gone to lawyers,
and they're putting it

06:52.001 --> 06:53.400
into one final blowout.

06:53.402 --> 06:55.369
Oh, okay, less ludicrous. Marginally.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.705
Yeah, it's the event of the summer.

06:57.707 --> 07:00.407
Dude, you gotta get me on the list.

07:00.409 --> 07:01.408
Uh, can't Paige get you on the list?

07:01.410 --> 07:02.877
Might be a nice break for her.

07:02.879 --> 07:04.745
No, I can't go through life
as Paige's plus-one.

07:04.747 --> 07:07.047
Come on, man, sometimes I need
to bring something to the party.

07:07.049 --> 07:08.182
And in this case...

07:08.184 --> 07:09.917
I can bring a party to the party.

07:09.919 --> 07:11.118
Uh, yeah, I'll see what I can do.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.254
- Really?
- No.

07:18.860 --> 07:21.629
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:21.631 --> 07:24.064
You got something against Eric Kassabian?

07:24.066 --> 07:25.599
No, why?

07:25.601 --> 07:28.169
Because you gave him
I.V. and oral steroids

07:28.171 --> 07:29.770
and he's a diabetic.

07:29.772 --> 07:32.006
- Sent him into D.K.A.
- What?

07:32.008 --> 07:34.275
That... that would've been on his chart.

07:34.277 --> 07:36.410
I would've seen it.

07:42.050 --> 07:44.451
Oh, my God.

07:44.453 --> 07:45.519
Oh, my God. Is he...

07:45.521 --> 07:47.821
Stable, but in the I.C.U.

07:47.823 --> 07:49.857
I don't see how I could have missed this.

07:49.859 --> 07:51.325
Well, neither does Jill Casey.

07:51.327 --> 07:53.761
- Not that she knows it was you.
- You didn't tell her?

07:53.763 --> 07:57.598
I said I couldn't remember
who I had administer the drugs.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.334
I also neglected to mention
that I gave you my code number

08:00.336 --> 08:01.902
to get 'em from the auto-dispenser.

08:01.904 --> 08:04.171
Now, she's gonna
figure it out eventually,

08:04.173 --> 08:05.773
but I thought we could use
some time to talk.

08:05.775 --> 08:06.907
When is your shift over?

08:06.909 --> 08:08.042
I just came on. I...

08:08.044 --> 08:09.643
Okay. Okay.

08:09.645 --> 08:13.714
Well, I suggest you go home sick
and just lie low for a while,

08:13.716 --> 08:14.715
okay?

08:14.717 --> 08:15.883
And while you're at it,

08:15.885 --> 08:17.751
cross your fingers,
light a candle, pray...

08:17.753 --> 08:20.254
whatever you think
will help Kassabian wake up,

08:20.256 --> 08:22.790
all right?

08:25.894 --> 08:28.128
That's not the way out, Katdare.

08:40.107 --> 08:43.277
Dr. Lawson!

08:45.046 --> 08:47.081
Oh, thank God you are here.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.550
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

08:49.552 --> 08:51.085
I'm dying.

08:51.087 --> 08:53.087
Uh, wow, you look pretty good for dying.

08:53.089 --> 08:56.523
No, just... emotionally dying.

08:56.525 --> 08:58.425
Physically, I think
I just have food poisoning

08:58.427 --> 09:00.327
- from all the catering samples.
- Hmm.

09:00.329 --> 09:01.762
Only, it's not "just."

09:01.764 --> 09:03.397
It's a catastrophe.

09:03.399 --> 09:04.965
The Barneses are supposed
to be going out in style,

09:04.967 --> 09:08.302
not in a mad dash to the bathroom.

09:08.304 --> 09:09.770
Oh, okay.

09:09.772 --> 09:12.539
Well, uh, have you
had any diarrhea or vomiting?

09:12.541 --> 09:16.310
Just a upset stomach
and, um, some cramping,

09:16.312 --> 09:18.245
but I know I have food poisoning,

09:18.247 --> 09:21.415
because I was fine
until I had the oysters.

09:21.417 --> 09:24.351
Or maybe it was the spot prawns
or the bison tartare.

09:24.353 --> 09:25.719
Ooh, you know what?

09:25.721 --> 09:27.121
It could have been the wild chanterelles,

09:27.123 --> 09:28.856
the foie gras lollipops,

09:28.858 --> 09:30.224
the billionaire's Risotto...

09:30.226 --> 09:31.425
Slow down.

09:31.427 --> 09:32.459
Are you saying you've eaten all of this?

09:32.461 --> 09:34.328
Yeah. Of course.

09:34.330 --> 09:36.730
N.U.G., Hank. N.U.G.

09:36.732 --> 09:37.731
Nug?

09:37.733 --> 09:39.366
"No unhappy guests."

09:39.368 --> 09:40.634
- Right.
- Yeah.

09:40.636 --> 09:42.069
Which means I never serve food that

09:42.071 --> 09:43.837
I haven't first tasted myself.

09:43.839 --> 09:45.739
Has anyone else sampled the food?

09:45.741 --> 09:47.174
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

09:47.176 --> 09:48.742
A lot of the guys setting up.

09:48.744 --> 09:50.344
You know, better than
letting it go to waste.

09:50.346 --> 09:54.581
Well, except for the whole,
you know, food poisoning part.

09:54.583 --> 09:56.317
Right. Have any of them had symptoms?

09:56.319 --> 09:58.485
I really couldn't say.

09:58.487 --> 10:00.387
Okay.

10:00.389 --> 10:03.991
Um, excuse me, your attention, everyone.

10:03.993 --> 10:05.793
Hi, my name is Dr. Lawson.

10:05.795 --> 10:09.330
Uh, if any of you have had any
sort of vomiting or diarrhea,

10:09.332 --> 10:11.899
it's important
that you come see me now, okay?

10:11.901 --> 10:13.500
Thank you.

10:13.502 --> 10:15.135
I bet you walk into a bar,
you could get a date or two

10:15.137 --> 10:16.370
with that line.

10:16.372 --> 10:17.871
'Scuse me, doc.

10:17.873 --> 10:19.340
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:19.342 --> 10:21.041
- Hank Lawson.
- Donny Shaughnessy.

10:21.043 --> 10:23.143
Nice to meet you, Donny.
So when did your symptoms start?

10:23.145 --> 10:25.612
Uh, I guess I was probably about eight.

10:25.614 --> 10:27.114
I was at Coney Island.

10:27.116 --> 10:29.149
My brother talked me
into going on that cyclone.

10:29.151 --> 10:31.618
Right before the bottom
of the second drop,

10:31.620 --> 10:32.753
just lost it.

10:32.755 --> 10:34.855
Both ends.

10:36.224 --> 10:37.591
Okay.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.626
And, uh, how are you today?

10:39.628 --> 10:41.028
It's all good.

10:41.030 --> 10:43.731
Great.

10:43.733 --> 10:45.165
I guess that's it. Thanks, Donny.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.333
Sure.

10:46.335 --> 10:48.202
Hey, do you mind if I...

10:48.204 --> 10:50.170
No, go ahead. Enjoy.

10:50.172 --> 10:52.039
Thanks.

10:52.041 --> 10:54.875
Thanks, doc.

10:54.877 --> 10:57.177
I suppose I could've
been a little clearer.

10:57.179 --> 10:59.813
Oh, don't beat yourself up too much.

10:59.815 --> 11:03.684
So, Lucy, your symptoms
and their lack of symptoms

11:03.686 --> 11:05.219
doesn't say food poisoning to me.

11:05.221 --> 11:06.954
What does it say?

11:06.956 --> 11:08.389
Overeating,

11:08.391 --> 11:10.124
and a party planner on a deadline.

11:10.126 --> 11:12.092
Okay, what if you're wrong?

11:12.094 --> 11:13.494
Don't worry, I'll be sure to follow up.

11:13.496 --> 11:15.696
In the meantime,
if you start having any, uh,

11:15.698 --> 11:17.498
Coney Island-style symptoms,

11:17.500 --> 11:18.866
make me your first call.

11:18.868 --> 11:20.234
Second.

11:20.236 --> 11:21.802
The first will be to a new caterer.

11:21.804 --> 11:23.804
Of course.

11:23.806 --> 11:26.373
All right.

11:29.310 --> 11:31.011
Hey, good morning.

11:31.013 --> 11:32.646
Hi, I'm Evan R. Lawson.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.281
I'm the C.F.O. of Hankmed.

11:34.283 --> 11:36.049
I'm filling in for Mrs. Collins.

11:36.051 --> 11:39.253
On the golf course, obviously,
not in... not full-time.

11:39.255 --> 11:40.888
Good to meet you, Evan. Sam Resnick.

11:40.890 --> 11:42.556
It's nice to meet you.

11:42.558 --> 11:44.224
Mr. Resnick's an old family friend,

11:44.226 --> 11:48.061
and, uh, I hope my new campaign chairman.

11:48.063 --> 11:51.031
So I take it Ellen
got a more exciting offer

11:51.033 --> 11:53.767
than watching me curse
and break my clubs in half.

11:55.037 --> 11:58.105
Well, I'm afraid, uh,
she's not feeling well.

11:58.107 --> 12:00.374
Wish her a speedy recovery
for me, will ya?

12:00.376 --> 12:01.475
I will.

12:01.477 --> 12:04.445
The thing is, Sam, um...

12:04.447 --> 12:08.148
Ellen's being treated
for a... a mood disorder.

12:08.150 --> 12:11.185
She's struggled with depression for...

12:11.187 --> 12:12.653
for some time now.

12:12.655 --> 12:14.021
I'm so sorry, bill, I...

12:14.023 --> 12:15.722
Well, the good news
is that she's responding really,

12:15.724 --> 12:17.224
really well to the treatment.

12:17.226 --> 12:19.259
Like really, really, really well.

12:19.261 --> 12:20.627
Well, of course she is.

12:20.629 --> 12:21.762
Ellen's a strong woman.

12:21.764 --> 12:23.096
Yes, she is.

12:23.098 --> 12:25.566
General Collins!

12:25.568 --> 12:26.934
My apologies keeping you waiting, sir.

12:26.936 --> 12:29.036
Jack O'Malley,
pro you're playing with today.

12:29.038 --> 12:31.138
Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Sam Resnick.

12:31.140 --> 12:32.439
It's an honor, sir.

12:32.441 --> 12:34.141
And Evan R. Lawson, C.F.O. of Hankmed.

12:34.143 --> 12:35.476
It...

12:35.478 --> 12:37.044
Hankmed? Hankmed?

12:37.046 --> 12:38.378
Hank Lawson Hankmed?

12:38.380 --> 12:40.581
- Yeah, that's my brother.
- What do ya know?

12:40.583 --> 12:42.115
He, uh, fixed up my hands last summer,

12:42.117 --> 12:43.250
did a bang-up job.

12:43.252 --> 12:44.284
Never mentioned you.

12:44.286 --> 12:45.419
Yeah, that's my brother.

12:45.421 --> 12:47.120
Hmm.

12:47.122 --> 12:48.522
How do you guys all know each other?

12:48.524 --> 12:50.824
Through me. Sam and I go way back,

12:50.826 --> 12:53.927
and Evan's engaged to my daughter Paige.

12:53.929 --> 12:55.562
Well, congratulations.

12:55.564 --> 12:57.297
Yeah.

12:57.299 --> 12:59.399
Shall we golf?

12:59.401 --> 13:01.802
Um, not to correct you or anything,

13:01.804 --> 13:04.171
but, per your request, Paige and I,

13:04.173 --> 13:07.708
we're not gonna get engaged
until after the campaign.

13:07.710 --> 13:11.812
Hey, you know, I've, uh,
I've given that some thought.

13:11.814 --> 13:16.016
You and Paige make it official
whenever you're ready.

13:16.018 --> 13:17.985
I give you my blessing.

13:26.127 --> 13:28.295
- Hello?
- Lucy, it's Hank Lawson.

13:28.297 --> 13:29.730
Just checking to see how you're feeling.

13:29.732 --> 13:30.864
Oh, working away.

13:30.866 --> 13:32.633
But no trips to Coney Island yet.

13:32.635 --> 13:33.734
Good, good.

13:33.736 --> 13:35.469
Oh, shoot, I have another call.

13:35.471 --> 13:36.737
Can you hang on one second?

13:36.739 --> 13:38.238
- I... I'll be quick.
- Yeah, sure.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.507
- Okay.
- Oh.

13:40.509 --> 13:41.909
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Jill.

13:41.911 --> 13:43.477
Is this a good time to talk?

13:43.479 --> 13:44.711
I got a patient on the other line,

13:44.713 --> 13:45.712
but it shouldn't take long.

13:45.714 --> 13:46.980
Can you hang on a sec?

13:46.982 --> 13:49.182
Sure.

13:49.184 --> 13:50.751
Hank, are you there?

13:50.753 --> 13:51.785
Uh, yeah, sorry about that.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.220
So, you were saying?

13:53.222 --> 13:54.221
Oh!

13:54.223 --> 13:56.023
- Oh! The cake!
- Lucy?

13:56.025 --> 13:58.125
It's ruined. I... I'm ruined.

13:59.261 --> 14:01.028
Lucy, are you okay?

14:01.030 --> 14:02.229
Hank, I... I don't know. I'm...

14:02.231 --> 14:05.799
my... my fingers don't feel right.

14:05.801 --> 14:06.867
They're all tingly.

14:06.869 --> 14:09.670
- Uh, I'm on my way.
- Okay.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.059
I'm begging you, okay?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.094
This is an emergency.

14:14.096 --> 14:15.495
The exact same cake.

14:15.497 --> 14:17.264
Name your price.

14:17.266 --> 14:20.066
That's a big name!

14:20.068 --> 14:21.902
Do you have nothing smaller,
you know, like a...

14:21.904 --> 14:22.936
like a nickname?

14:22.938 --> 14:24.404
Maybe a moniker?

14:24.406 --> 14:26.806
Oh, just forget it!

14:26.808 --> 14:28.808
Well, silver lining:

14:28.810 --> 14:30.844
if I am dying, it dovetails nicely

14:30.846 --> 14:31.811
with the day I'm having.

14:31.813 --> 14:33.113
You're not dying, okay?

14:33.115 --> 14:34.581
But your symptoms are pretty nonspecific

14:34.583 --> 14:36.182
so I can't say what <i>is</i> going on, yet.

14:36.184 --> 14:38.285
Now, what about the party tomorrow?

14:38.287 --> 14:40.887
Is there an assistant
who can cover for you?

14:40.889 --> 14:43.924
I am the assistant, Hank.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.059
- Don't tell the Barneses, okay?
- Okay.

14:46.061 --> 14:48.061
But, five days ago, my boss was flown

14:48.063 --> 14:51.031
to the Seychelles
by some Bahrainian sultan

14:51.033 --> 14:53.233
to do a wedding
that makes this thing look like

14:53.235 --> 14:54.668
a last-minute get-together.

14:54.670 --> 14:55.802
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

14:55.804 --> 14:58.772
So if I pull this off, I'm a hero.

14:58.774 --> 15:01.207
But if not, I'm done for.

15:01.209 --> 15:03.476
N.U.G., Hank. N.U.G.

15:03.478 --> 15:04.511
Okay, I get it.

15:04.513 --> 15:05.779
I get it.

15:05.781 --> 15:09.482
Open for me, please.

15:09.484 --> 15:10.684
Ahh.

15:10.686 --> 15:11.985
All right, since I last saw you,

15:11.987 --> 15:13.019
what have you eaten?

15:13.021 --> 15:14.287
Why? What's in my teeth?

15:14.289 --> 15:15.422
No, nothing.

15:15.424 --> 15:16.623
Um, were you sampling the cake

15:16.625 --> 15:18.692
Off... off the ground? No.

15:18.694 --> 15:20.593
No, it was there
for more than three seconds.

15:20.595 --> 15:22.896
Okay, then that's not icing
in the corners of your mouth.

15:22.898 --> 15:23.964
It's thrush.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.166
I'll prescribe an oral nystatin.

15:26.168 --> 15:27.534
Wait a minute.

15:27.536 --> 15:30.971
If I get sick during the party,
h... how fast can you get here?

15:30.973 --> 15:33.106
Uh, well, I drive a Saab,
not an ambulance,

15:33.108 --> 15:34.407
but I can get here pretty quick.

15:34.409 --> 15:37.077
Wait! I know!
You can come to the party.

15:37.079 --> 15:40.680
Not as a doctor, of course, as a guest.

15:40.682 --> 15:42.983
Unless I get sick, then,
in which case, as a doctor.

15:42.985 --> 15:43.917
Please?

15:43.919 --> 15:46.586
Um, you can have a plus-one.

15:46.588 --> 15:48.621
Can I have a plus-more-than-one?

15:48.623 --> 15:51.691
- Sure!
- Okay.

15:51.693 --> 15:53.426
So you're mormon?

16:09.210 --> 16:11.411
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:11.413 --> 16:12.979
Thought you were in pediatrics today?

16:12.981 --> 16:14.481
I am. I am.

16:14.483 --> 16:15.715
Uh, i... it's... it's my lunch break.

16:15.717 --> 16:18.351
Oh, okay.

16:18.353 --> 16:22.055
And, uh, you're spending it here because?

16:30.498 --> 16:33.767
You're the one who gave him the I.V.

16:33.769 --> 16:36.336
I'm sorry, Jill.

16:36.338 --> 16:39.539
I keep going through his charts
over and over again

16:39.541 --> 16:41.908
trying to figure out
how I could have missed it,

16:41.910 --> 16:43.343
and... and I can't.

16:43.345 --> 16:45.812
I can't because it's there
in black and white.

16:47.816 --> 16:49.282
Mr. Kassabian! Mr. Kassabian!

16:49.284 --> 16:50.483
Try not to talk.

16:50.485 --> 16:51.618
You're in a hospital.

16:51.620 --> 16:52.786
You're intubated.

16:52.788 --> 16:53.720
Nurse Marnie.

16:53.722 --> 16:54.954
Mr. Kassabian's awake.

16:54.956 --> 16:58.825
We'll be right in.

16:58.827 --> 17:00.160
Divya.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.200
If I can get someone
to cover me in pediatrics,

17:07.202 --> 17:08.701
I... I would like to be here.

17:08.703 --> 17:10.103
I'm sorry, Divya, I can't do that.

17:10.105 --> 17:11.805
- Jill, I think it's really...
- I know.

17:11.807 --> 17:13.807
Okay? I know what you're feeling.

17:13.809 --> 17:16.476
And again, I am sorry.

17:16.478 --> 17:21.381
But, Divya, until this
investigation's complete,

17:21.383 --> 17:24.951
I have to put you on leave.

17:24.953 --> 17:26.752
Effective immediately.

17:37.698 --> 17:41.167
Thursday night? Nope, can't do it.

17:46.340 --> 17:49.909
35 grand a plate?

17:52.647 --> 17:54.647
Fine, I'll be there.

17:54.649 --> 17:57.250
Call later.

17:57.252 --> 18:01.754
Um, sorry, general,
I couldn't help but overhear.

18:01.756 --> 18:03.690
I'm... I'm sure you forgot,
but you're supposed to be

18:03.692 --> 18:05.525
in Brooklyn on Thursday to relieve Paige.

18:05.527 --> 18:08.328
Son, the campaign
isn't a 9:00-to-5:00 job.

18:08.330 --> 18:10.697
Places I have to be at
keep me hopping faster

18:10.699 --> 18:12.599
than a jackrabbit in a cabbage patch.

18:12.601 --> 18:14.033
Yeah, I get it.

18:14.035 --> 18:17.137
You don't, but you will.

18:17.139 --> 18:20.440
My press secretary's
e-mailing you a calendar

18:20.442 --> 18:22.775
of events you and Paige need to be at.

18:22.777 --> 18:26.112
You do, uh, own some clothes
that aren't pink?

18:26.114 --> 18:28.948
Yeah, um...

18:28.950 --> 18:31.751
Sir, I'm sorry, you can't
keep doing this to Paige.

18:31.753 --> 18:33.186
You can't.

18:33.188 --> 18:35.889
She's put her whole life
on hold for you, sir.

18:35.891 --> 18:38.558
You said you're gonna be
in Brooklyn on Thursday,

18:38.560 --> 18:42.028
you should be there.

18:45.567 --> 18:47.400
Remember that blessing I gave you?

18:47.402 --> 18:49.402
Yes.

18:53.073 --> 18:54.774
Withdrawn.

19:01.382 --> 19:02.448
Yeah.

19:06.621 --> 19:08.988
Hey. Can I come in?

19:08.990 --> 19:10.490
Are you here to apologize?

19:10.492 --> 19:12.325
For what?

19:12.327 --> 19:13.860
I don't know, but apparently
it's required to enter.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.529
Oh. [Laughs] Not yet, no.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.331
I've had the administrator,
the head of the E.R.,

19:18.333 --> 19:19.532
the legal team...

19:19.534 --> 19:21.568
you name it, they're sorry.

19:21.570 --> 19:23.836
Yeah. Well, I'm sure you can
understand their concern.

19:23.838 --> 19:25.738
Yeah.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.106
They don't want to get sued.

19:27.108 --> 19:30.543
Uh, I was gonna say
your health, but... yeah.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.278
They don't want to get sued.

19:32.280 --> 19:36.516
I'm not the litigious type,

19:36.518 --> 19:38.918
but let's face it.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.187
If you hadn't shown up when you did,

19:41.189 --> 19:43.189
we would not be having this conversation.

19:43.191 --> 19:46.492
No. We wouldn't.

19:46.494 --> 19:48.828
And it's not like I need the money,

19:48.830 --> 19:51.197
but there's also
the principle of the thing.

19:51.199 --> 19:54.767
Someone screwed up.

19:54.769 --> 19:57.036
You're not saying anything.

19:57.038 --> 19:59.639
No. I'm not.

19:59.641 --> 20:01.541
Because you disagree with me?

20:01.543 --> 20:03.643
No. No.

20:03.645 --> 20:05.511
Because, once upon a time,
I was the doctor

20:05.513 --> 20:07.747
who got blamed for a screw up.

20:07.749 --> 20:11.351
You? Hank, you're a great doctor.

20:11.353 --> 20:13.353
Thanks. I try, but I'm not perfect.

20:13.355 --> 20:14.988
No one is.

20:14.990 --> 20:16.756
The bottom line is:

20:16.758 --> 20:20.560
if you sue,
it shouldn't be about the money.

20:20.562 --> 20:22.862
It should be about making sure
whoever did this

20:22.864 --> 20:26.266
learns from their mistake.

20:42.650 --> 20:45.652
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

20:48.088 --> 20:52.425
And, uh, sorry about... you know.

20:52.427 --> 20:54.861
It's okay.

20:54.863 --> 20:58.931
Wait, is "you know" threatening Van Dyke

20:58.933 --> 21:02.702
or is "you know"
not coming back on the phone

21:02.704 --> 21:04.871
- after you asked me to...
- Oh, my God.

21:04.873 --> 21:05.972
I didn't, did I?

21:05.974 --> 21:08.574
I did. I... I apologize again.

21:08.576 --> 21:10.143
It's okay.

21:10.145 --> 21:12.812
Again.

21:13.848 --> 21:15.715
Listen, Hank, we need to talk about...

21:15.717 --> 21:16.916
I know, I know.

21:16.918 --> 21:18.418
I was just so angry with him.

21:18.420 --> 21:20.787
Not where I was going with that.

21:20.789 --> 21:23.690
But since we're on it, um...

21:23.692 --> 21:26.225
look, Van Dyke's name being on those meds

21:26.227 --> 21:28.461
doesn't necessarily tell the whole story.

21:28.463 --> 21:29.996
Well, someone made a mistake.

21:29.998 --> 21:31.397
And you never have?

21:31.399 --> 21:34.867
Yeah, no, of course I have. I have.

21:34.869 --> 21:37.670
But, I don't know, he's
the doctor of record, you know?

21:37.672 --> 21:39.339
The buck stops with him.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.140
No.

21:41.142 --> 21:43.209
No, I'm the administrator.

21:43.211 --> 21:44.377
The buck stops with me.

21:44.379 --> 21:45.945
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

21:45.947 --> 21:48.614
You know you are sexy when you get all

21:48.616 --> 21:50.283
administrator-y.

21:50.285 --> 21:51.451
I am?

21:51.453 --> 21:54.554
Executive authority
is a known aphrodisiac.

21:54.556 --> 21:56.556
Okay.

22:01.096 --> 22:02.695
Listen, Hank...

22:03.965 --> 22:06.966
Uh, hold that thought.

22:11.405 --> 22:12.739
Hanky panky!

22:12.741 --> 22:14.774
Jack! Hey. Oh...

22:14.776 --> 22:16.676
uh, what are you... what are you...

22:16.678 --> 22:18.211
what are you doing here?

22:18.213 --> 22:19.679
Oh, spending a couple weeks
as a local pro between...

22:19.681 --> 22:20.980
tourneys.

22:20.982 --> 22:22.448
And figured you'd just drop in?

22:22.450 --> 22:24.884
Yes, I did, because
I met your brother this morning.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.252
You never mentioned you had a brother.

22:26.254 --> 22:27.453
Nice guy.

22:27.455 --> 22:29.255
Yeah, no, he is. He is nice.

22:29.257 --> 22:30.256
You couldn't call first?

22:30.258 --> 22:31.257
- Here's the thing.
- Yeah.

22:31.259 --> 22:32.525
So, look, I...

22:32.527 --> 22:34.994
Look, after you
fix up my mitts last summer,

22:34.996 --> 22:37.029
I... I just had
the best season of my career.

22:37.031 --> 22:38.531
Now, I got these sponsors,

22:38.533 --> 22:39.766
and the sponsors want me
to get a physical

22:39.768 --> 22:41.367
to make sure I don't, you know...

22:41.369 --> 22:42.835
drop dead with all their money.

22:42.837 --> 22:45.772
And I thought, "who better
to poke and prod me than you?"

22:45.774 --> 22:47.473
Hey, Jack.

22:50.444 --> 22:51.611
That was a rhetorical question.

22:51.613 --> 22:52.979
Casey!

22:52.981 --> 22:54.614
Aren't you supposed to be in Uruguay?

22:54.616 --> 22:56.015
Yeah, I got back last month.

22:56.017 --> 22:56.983
How... how... how do you...

22:56.985 --> 22:58.885
how do you know about Uruguay?

22:58.887 --> 23:00.486
- Ah, we're friends.
- Oh.

23:00.488 --> 23:01.821
Well, Facebook friends.

23:01.823 --> 23:02.822
Facebook friends.

23:02.824 --> 23:04.090
- Right.
- Yeah.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.558
Social networking, Hanky.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.793
You know, we're all up
in each other's business

23:06.795 --> 23:08.594
24/7 these days, aren't we?

23:08.596 --> 23:09.829
Yes, we are.

23:13.434 --> 23:16.636
Okay. Ok... am I?

23:16.638 --> 23:18.037
Kind of.

23:18.039 --> 23:20.373
Kind... kind of? Kind...

23:20.375 --> 23:22.108
so should I...

23:22.110 --> 23:25.311
kind of stay or kind of go?

23:28.015 --> 23:29.482
Sit down, Mitts. I'll get you a glass.

23:29.484 --> 23:31.083
All right.

23:31.085 --> 23:32.218
Oh, thank you.

23:43.638 --> 23:45.171
Wow.

23:47.541 --> 23:49.709
- This is stunning.
- Yeah.

23:49.711 --> 23:51.244
Yeah, I can't believe
I scored us invites for this.

23:51.246 --> 23:53.646
You didn't. Has anyone heard from Divya?

23:53.648 --> 23:55.248
She was supposed to meet us.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.583
Yeah, uh, she said that she
was feeling under the weather.

23:57.585 --> 24:00.520
Hi, and welcome.
May I have your names, please?

24:00.522 --> 24:02.889
Yeah, Lawson, Evan R.

24:02.891 --> 24:04.557
It was five, now it's three.

24:04.559 --> 24:07.293
Paige isn't coming?

24:07.295 --> 24:09.362
- No.
- Why?

24:09.364 --> 24:11.731
May I use a golf analogy?

24:11.733 --> 24:13.699
I blew it.

24:13.701 --> 24:15.668
Right. And the golf part is?

24:15.670 --> 24:18.237
So I accuse the general
of taking Paige for granted.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.473
Now, not only is my invitation
to join the family revoked,

24:20.475 --> 24:22.141
but I think he's retaliated
by making sure

24:22.143 --> 24:24.410
that she doesn't show up today.

24:24.412 --> 24:26.245
And I'm upset about it, so...

24:26.247 --> 24:27.747
just don't... don't leave me alone.

24:27.749 --> 24:31.117
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but your fourth, a Ms. Collins,

24:31.119 --> 24:32.151
has already arrived.

24:32.153 --> 24:33.953
I'll see you guys later.

24:34.956 --> 24:38.391
Thank you.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.092
Hey, uh, you mind
if I disappear for a minute?

24:40.094 --> 24:41.894
Not at all.

24:41.896 --> 24:43.229
The, uh, people-watching
opportunities here

24:43.231 --> 24:44.530
will keep me very entertained.

24:44.532 --> 24:45.965
I'll catch you later, okay?

24:45.967 --> 24:46.966
All right.

24:49.169 --> 24:50.937
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

24:50.939 --> 24:53.239
I'm so happy your dad came through.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.874
Of course he did.

24:54.876 --> 24:56.576
Why do you look so surprised?

24:56.578 --> 24:57.910
I'm not... I... it's joy.

24:57.912 --> 24:59.845
It's...
People often mistake my joy face

24:59.847 --> 25:01.113
for my surprised face,
it's quite a thing.

25:01.115 --> 25:04.450
I'm just... I'm just glad you're here.

25:06.887 --> 25:09.288
Did you bake that?

25:09.290 --> 25:12.558
Yeah, I started at midnight,
and finished at 6:00.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.093
That's amazing.

25:14.095 --> 25:18.364
Yeah, I mean,
t... t... t... the fun is in the design,

25:18.366 --> 25:22.568
but the looks on people's faces
when they actually taste it,

25:22.570 --> 25:24.203
that's why I do it.

25:24.205 --> 25:25.504
Lucy, your voice is raspy.

25:25.506 --> 25:26.739
Oh, yeah.

25:26.741 --> 25:29.342
Um, baking all night,
barking orders all day.

25:30.345 --> 25:32.244
But I have to tell you,

25:32.246 --> 25:33.946
pulling an all-nighter?

25:33.948 --> 25:37.483
I haven't had that much fun
in a long time.

25:37.485 --> 25:38.884
That's great. That's great.

25:38.886 --> 25:41.153
And today, how are you feeling,
other than tired?

25:41.155 --> 25:43.856
Well, two of my staff showed up hungover,

25:43.858 --> 25:45.057
we're running out of ice,

25:45.059 --> 25:46.959
and, uh, the numbness
in my hands has put me

25:46.961 --> 25:47.994
way behind schedule.

25:47.996 --> 25:49.362
Hmm.

25:49.364 --> 25:52.064
Hey, how were you in surgical rotation?

25:52.066 --> 25:53.566
Uh, why? You need me to scrub in?

25:53.568 --> 25:55.301
Well, yeah. Kind of.

25:55.303 --> 25:57.870
Um, I need to write "That's all, folks!"

25:57.872 --> 25:59.171
All right, that's funny.

25:59.173 --> 26:01.173
Yeah. [Laughs] On the top right here.

26:01.175 --> 26:04.644
But my fingers are numb,
and I need a steady hand,

26:04.646 --> 26:06.779
like, a... a really steady hand.

26:06.781 --> 26:08.981
I guess you don't know
about doctors and handwriting.

26:08.983 --> 26:12.084
Yeah, I do.
And that is how desperate I am.

26:12.086 --> 26:14.286
- Please?
- Uh, okay.

26:14.288 --> 26:16.122
Just remember the N.U.G., Hank.

26:16.124 --> 26:17.590
- Right. Okay.
- N.U.G.

26:19.793 --> 26:22.428
Deeply divided, we are gathered here,

26:22.430 --> 26:25.331
in the presence of our loved ones

26:25.333 --> 26:27.266
and less than loved ones,

26:27.268 --> 26:30.269
to divide Gregg and Audrey Barnes

26:30.271 --> 26:32.772
in perpetuity.

26:32.774 --> 26:36.909
Do you, Gregg Barnes,
give Audrey Barnes back

26:36.911 --> 26:39.111
to the dating pool?

26:39.113 --> 26:40.813
I do.

26:40.815 --> 26:45.484
And do you, Audrey Barnes,
return this ring to Gregg Barnes

26:45.486 --> 26:48.587
as a symbol of your eternal indifference?

26:48.589 --> 26:49.588
You bet.

26:50.925 --> 26:54.827
By the power vested
in me by some random website,

26:54.829 --> 26:57.897
I know pronounce you
ex-husband and ex-wife.

26:57.899 --> 27:00.166
You may kiss other people!

27:06.606 --> 27:08.374
"Folks."

27:08.376 --> 27:09.375
Hank!

27:09.377 --> 27:10.810
Exclamation point.

27:10.812 --> 27:14.180
Oh! Look at you.

27:14.182 --> 27:16.348
You know, if this whole medicine thing

27:16.350 --> 27:18.684
doesn't work out, you might
have a future in pastry.

27:18.686 --> 27:20.653
- Good to know. Good to know.
- Mm-hmm.

27:20.655 --> 27:22.788
Speaking of the medicine
thing, uh, your blood test

27:22.790 --> 27:23.989
should be back soon.

27:23.991 --> 27:25.157
Okay, well, if they come back

27:25.159 --> 27:26.726
before the end of the party,
do not tell me.

27:26.728 --> 27:27.960
I have enough to worry about.

27:27.962 --> 27:29.528
You got it. No worries.

27:29.530 --> 27:31.931
Okay. Thank you.

27:31.933 --> 27:32.932
Sure.

28:44.337 --> 28:49.108
So, um, I kinda have some bad news.

28:49.110 --> 28:50.276
Okay.

28:50.278 --> 28:52.645
The general... your father...

28:52.647 --> 28:55.114
- daddy.
- Don't call him that.

28:55.116 --> 28:59.118
I shouldn't, you're right.
It felt weird coming out.

28:59.120 --> 29:01.420
He doesn't approve of me

29:01.422 --> 29:03.522
as much as I'd hoped.

29:03.524 --> 29:04.957
Why do you say that?

29:04.959 --> 29:08.227
Because I spoke my mind to him, finally.

29:08.229 --> 29:10.429
And he really did not like my mind.

29:10.431 --> 29:12.631
Hmm.

29:14.835 --> 29:18.704
You know what? That's his problem.

29:18.706 --> 29:20.039
Excuse me?

29:20.041 --> 29:22.341
What he thinks of you or doesn't think,

29:22.343 --> 29:25.044
what he approves of
or doesn't approve of,

29:25.046 --> 29:26.111
we don't care anymore.

29:26.113 --> 29:27.913
- We don't?
- No.

29:27.915 --> 29:32.017
And... I can't wait anymore.

29:32.019 --> 29:33.018
What...

29:35.121 --> 29:39.258
Evan R. Lawson, will you marry me?

29:42.696 --> 29:45.698
In a heartbeat, Paige Collins.

29:48.668 --> 29:50.402
I just wish that

29:50.404 --> 29:52.271
we had your mom's ring

29:52.273 --> 29:55.074
so you could put it on me.

29:55.076 --> 29:56.075
Really?

29:56.077 --> 29:57.643
What?

29:57.645 --> 29:58.677
How?

29:58.679 --> 30:02.715
I carry it with me wherever I go.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.718
Just in case.

30:20.433 --> 30:24.637
Of all the divorce parties
on Gin Lane I've ever been to,

30:24.639 --> 30:28.073
this is definitely my favorite.

30:28.075 --> 30:31.510
Almost makes you wanna
break up with someone.

30:32.512 --> 30:34.647
Hank,

30:34.649 --> 30:35.781
we gotta break up.

30:35.783 --> 30:38.884
Excuse me?

30:38.886 --> 30:41.220
I'm leaving.

30:41.222 --> 30:43.822
And... I like you.

30:46.226 --> 30:48.260
No. No. That...
that doesn't even cover it.

30:48.262 --> 30:51.664
Hank, I am... I'm crazy about you.

30:52.633 --> 30:53.933
Okay?

30:53.935 --> 30:59.705
And it's making it really hard
for me to go.

30:59.707 --> 31:01.941
Then we gotta break up.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.509
We do?

31:03.511 --> 31:05.444
Yeah.

31:05.446 --> 31:08.447
I care about you way too much
to want to hold you back.

31:11.918 --> 31:15.454
Why is this so hard?

31:15.456 --> 31:18.991
'Cause whatever we did,
then stopped doing,

31:18.993 --> 31:22.227
then started doing again...

31:22.229 --> 31:24.396
was real.

31:24.398 --> 31:28.434
Is real.

31:28.436 --> 31:32.738
I could come back one day.

31:32.740 --> 31:35.741
And we'll always have South Hampton.

31:51.058 --> 31:52.925
You got it. You got it.

31:52.927 --> 31:54.960
You did it!

31:54.962 --> 31:56.795
Yay! Boys, I'm so impressed.

31:56.797 --> 31:57.796
Now, go.

31:57.798 --> 31:58.864
Good.

32:04.270 --> 32:07.439
Oh, God. Okay.

32:07.441 --> 32:08.741
Okay.

32:08.743 --> 32:10.376
Damn it! Come on.

32:13.547 --> 32:14.713
Damn, Lucy...

32:32.399 --> 32:34.066
Lucy! Are you okay?

32:34.068 --> 32:35.200
Hank, I...

32:35.202 --> 32:38.170
I think I'm having a heart attack.

32:40.313 --> 32:41.980
Just... just breathe, Lucy. Slow, deep.

32:41.982 --> 32:43.449
I... I can't.

32:43.451 --> 32:45.517
Yes, you can. Just breathe in and out.

32:45.519 --> 32:47.252
My heart, it... it's pounding.

32:47.254 --> 32:48.487
Look, I don't think it's your heart,

32:48.489 --> 32:50.089
I think you're having an anxiety attack.

32:50.091 --> 32:52.591
No, no, no, no.

32:52.593 --> 32:54.726
I... I don't have anxiety attacks.

32:54.728 --> 32:55.828
I don't panic.

32:55.830 --> 32:57.129
I do not. I don't...

32:57.131 --> 33:01.667
In and out. Just try to calm down.

33:01.669 --> 33:03.936
Calm? C... calm?

33:03.938 --> 33:05.437
I... look at me!

33:05.439 --> 33:06.939
I am freaking out.

33:06.941 --> 33:09.475
I... I can't function. I... I...

33:09.477 --> 33:11.210
I can't do anything.

33:11.212 --> 33:13.412
It's... it's... it's... it's all over.

33:13.414 --> 33:14.947
My career.

33:14.949 --> 33:15.948
This party.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.716
My job. My...

33:17.718 --> 33:20.719
future.

33:30.063 --> 33:32.030
- Lucy?
- What?

33:32.032 --> 33:33.499
You're... you're crying, but...

33:33.501 --> 33:35.000
Yeah.

33:35.002 --> 33:36.235
there aren't any tears coming
out of your eyes.

33:36.237 --> 33:37.836
Oh, yeah.

33:37.838 --> 33:42.441
Sometimes that happens. I'm a dry crier.

33:42.443 --> 33:44.476
God, I can't even do that right.

33:44.478 --> 33:46.745
Now, look, I know you have a dry mouth

33:46.747 --> 33:50.215
because of the thrush,
but do you ever have a dry nose?

33:50.217 --> 33:52.951
Um, yeah, a lot. Why?

33:52.953 --> 33:55.087
Because it's an indicator
of Sjogren's syndrome.

33:55.089 --> 33:57.589
Oh, a syndrome.

33:57.591 --> 33:59.558
Jesus, Hank, now I have a syndrome.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.560
No, no, no. Just relax, Lucy.

34:01.562 --> 34:03.529
It means your tear glands are inflamed,

34:03.531 --> 34:04.630
and that reduces tear production.

34:04.632 --> 34:07.633
Here, let me try something.

34:10.036 --> 34:11.402
Okay, if you're trying to calm me down,

34:11.405 --> 34:12.670
it's really not working.

34:12.672 --> 34:14.172
You're just making my face twitch.

34:14.175 --> 34:15.940
Which means you're hypocalcemic.

34:15.943 --> 34:18.577
Lucy, I think you have celiac disease.

34:18.579 --> 34:20.478
Because my cheek twitched?

34:20.481 --> 34:25.583
That, the Sjogren's,
the stomachaches, the nausea...

34:25.585 --> 34:27.886
it's your body telling you
it can't tolerate gluten,

34:27.888 --> 34:30.822
a protein found in wheat
and a few other grains.

34:30.824 --> 34:32.690
Okay, wait.

34:32.693 --> 34:36.295
Then why... why wouldn't
I have had this my whole life?

34:36.297 --> 34:38.463
Yeah. Silent celiac
can present atypically

34:38.465 --> 34:40.632
and be triggered by stress.

34:40.634 --> 34:42.833
I'd like to get a specialist
to do a biopsy to confirm,

34:42.835 --> 34:45.938
but if you have celiac, we'll
find you a great nutritionist,

34:45.940 --> 34:48.040
and you should be fine.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.676
- What? That... that's it?
- That's it.

34:52.179 --> 34:54.246
Oh.

34:54.248 --> 34:55.514
What? What is it?

34:55.516 --> 34:58.283
Um, can I live with this long enough

34:58.285 --> 35:00.385
to see the cake get cut and the Barneses

35:00.387 --> 35:03.855
do whatever people do with cake

35:03.857 --> 35:05.090
when they're getting divorced?

35:05.092 --> 35:07.025
Sure.

35:07.027 --> 35:08.293
As long as they don't feed it to you.

35:10.197 --> 35:12.197
Thank you.

35:20.940 --> 35:25.410
Without beating a dead horse,
I am truly sorry.

35:25.412 --> 35:27.246
Well, that horse
has been dead for so long

35:27.248 --> 35:30.582
that it is now decomposing.

35:30.584 --> 35:33.285
I have never made
a mistake like that before,

35:33.287 --> 35:35.220
and I never will again.

35:35.222 --> 35:37.322
Look, you weren't
the only one who made a mistake.

35:37.324 --> 35:39.558
Ever since I was diagnosed,
I've told every

35:39.560 --> 35:42.094
health professional
I come in contact with

35:42.096 --> 35:44.463
that I was a diabetic.

35:44.465 --> 35:48.033
And this time I didn't.

35:48.035 --> 35:50.969
Mr. Kassabian,

35:50.971 --> 35:53.805
this is not your responsibility to bear.

35:53.807 --> 35:55.073
This is mine.

35:55.075 --> 35:57.776
I have learned from my mistake.

35:57.778 --> 35:59.144
Divya, I'm not suing.

35:59.146 --> 36:01.747
That is not why I said that.

36:01.749 --> 36:03.882
I know.

36:03.884 --> 36:06.985
I know.

36:06.987 --> 36:11.256
But it's also part
of how I've reached my decision.

36:11.258 --> 36:13.492
It was a mistake.

36:13.494 --> 36:15.260
I'm still alive.

36:15.262 --> 36:19.698
All is forgiven.

36:19.700 --> 36:22.834
Thank you.

36:22.836 --> 36:25.837
Now I just have to forgive myself.

36:31.312 --> 36:33.111
Doesn't this thing go any faster?

36:33.113 --> 36:34.479
You know what?

36:34.481 --> 36:36.315
It's an expensive piece of equipment.

36:36.317 --> 36:37.916
I'd rather not break it.

36:37.918 --> 36:41.720
So serious when you're doctoring.

36:41.722 --> 36:43.021
Come on!

36:43.023 --> 36:43.989
Okay, that's it.

36:47.328 --> 36:51.296
Yeah, your, uh... your heart
seems to be doing well.

36:51.298 --> 36:53.865
Funny you should
mention that, you know...

36:53.867 --> 36:56.968
the other night, doc, when I was here,

36:56.970 --> 36:59.705
I couldn't help but feel I was
interrupting something...

36:59.707 --> 37:02.474
personal.

37:02.476 --> 37:05.077
You know, between you and Jill.

37:05.079 --> 37:07.245
Personal?

37:07.247 --> 37:11.616
Dr. Lawson, are you and Casey
seeing one another again?

37:11.618 --> 37:12.884
Jill and I? No.

37:12.886 --> 37:16.188
No.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.489
Is that all?

37:17.491 --> 37:19.358
All right, all right. We were, you know?

37:19.360 --> 37:21.727
But with Jill going
off to Uruguay in three weeks...

37:21.729 --> 37:23.395
I meant with the stress test.

37:23.397 --> 37:25.964
Oh. Yeah.

37:25.966 --> 37:28.166
Of course you did.

37:38.811 --> 37:40.245
Yeah?

37:40.247 --> 37:42.013
Got a minute?

37:42.015 --> 37:45.016
Of course. Yeah, come on in.

37:45.018 --> 37:48.153
Uh, look, the reason
you haven't heard from me

37:48.155 --> 37:51.523
is because they haven't
scheduled your review yet.

37:51.525 --> 37:53.725
That's not why I'm here.

37:53.727 --> 37:57.195
Okay.

37:57.197 --> 38:00.298
I want to offer my resignation.

38:00.300 --> 38:01.566
Divya...

38:01.568 --> 38:03.835
Please don't try to talk me out of it.

38:03.837 --> 38:04.870
I accept.

38:04.872 --> 38:06.304
You do?

38:06.306 --> 38:10.342
Yeah.

38:10.344 --> 38:11.643
Of course. Of course you do.

38:11.645 --> 38:14.946
Yeah.

38:14.948 --> 38:18.250
Look...

38:18.252 --> 38:20.986
this is for the best.

38:20.988 --> 38:24.823
Okay, let's be honest.

38:24.825 --> 38:29.361
This whole situation's
been awkward from the start.

38:29.363 --> 38:31.363
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:31.365 --> 38:33.365
Yes, it was.

38:35.001 --> 38:37.002
Did Hank suggest you do this?

38:37.004 --> 38:38.537
Hank doesn't know that I work here,

38:38.539 --> 38:42.073
why would he suggest that I resign?

38:42.075 --> 38:44.075
You don't know.

38:46.879 --> 38:48.947
Eric Kassabian?

38:48.949 --> 38:51.716
He's a Hankmed patient.

39:05.398 --> 39:08.299
Hank Lawson on the golf course.

39:08.301 --> 39:09.833
That can only mean one of two things.

39:09.835 --> 39:13.137
One: you are now no longer
the only doctor in America

39:13.139 --> 39:14.638
who does not golf, or two:

39:14.640 --> 39:18.008
I am about to be the lucky recipient

39:18.010 --> 39:23.213
of a bona fide... clean bill of health.

39:23.215 --> 39:24.782
I'm not here to play golf.

39:24.784 --> 39:26.317
See, now that's
what I was hoping to hear.

39:26.319 --> 39:27.685
But, unfortunately,

39:27.687 --> 39:29.486
I won't be able to sign
your paperwork... yet.

39:29.488 --> 39:31.956
Uh, doc, that was not one of the options.

39:31.958 --> 39:33.357
Jack, your white blood cell count

39:33.359 --> 39:35.259
came back slightly abnormal.

39:35.261 --> 39:37.528
Abnormal?

39:37.530 --> 39:41.432
Like, I'm unique or I'm a case study?

39:41.434 --> 39:43.600
I don't know.

39:43.602 --> 39:45.636
It, uh... it could be
a meaningless variation,

39:45.638 --> 39:47.671
but I'd like to order an A.N.A test,

39:47.673 --> 39:49.606
antinuclear antibodies, to be sure.

39:49.608 --> 39:52.943
- No need for alarm.
- Please, doc.

39:52.945 --> 39:54.511
You as my doctor?

39:54.513 --> 39:56.547
Alarm never entered my mind.

39:58.016 --> 39:59.583
Humdinger!

40:02.120 --> 40:05.656
To the future Mrs. Evan R. Lawson,

40:05.658 --> 40:07.858
and the future Mr. Paige Collins.

40:09.395 --> 40:12.096
That's it? That's the whole speech?

40:12.098 --> 40:13.430
That's it, my friend.

40:13.432 --> 40:15.499
The only adjective we get is "future"?

40:15.501 --> 40:18.135
Okay, you know about me
and public speaking, all right?

40:18.137 --> 40:20.204
Public? What's public about...
there are two of us here.

40:20.206 --> 40:21.372
We gotta rethink him as my best man...

40:21.374 --> 40:22.840
- Evan. Evan!
- The speech is so...

40:22.842 --> 40:24.842
Drink.

40:24.844 --> 40:25.843
Thank you.

40:25.845 --> 40:27.644
This cake is delicious.

40:27.646 --> 40:30.314
I know, and it's gluten-free.
Lucy baked it.

40:30.316 --> 40:31.749
Hey, it's a good thing daddy

40:31.751 --> 40:34.351
sent plenty of the good stuff.

40:34.353 --> 40:35.652
It's nice having daddy on board.

40:35.654 --> 40:37.054
- Evan.
- The general on board.

40:37.056 --> 40:38.956
I know, it feels really weird,
and I should stop.

40:38.958 --> 40:42.393
Well, whatever you said
to him last night on the phone,

40:42.395 --> 40:43.727
he was impressed.

40:43.729 --> 40:45.329
And happy.

40:45.331 --> 40:47.498
Which makes me happy.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.534
Which makes me happy.

40:50.536 --> 40:51.935
- Happy.
- Hi.

40:51.937 --> 40:53.237
Okay, hi.

40:55.441 --> 40:58.275
To my impressive baby brother

40:58.277 --> 41:00.344
and his beautiful bride-to-be.

41:00.346 --> 41:02.312
I've never seen two people
who belong together more,

41:02.314 --> 41:03.914
and I couldn't be prouder,

41:03.916 --> 41:05.916
or happier.

41:07.986 --> 41:11.855
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.

41:11.857 --> 41:13.223
Thank you.

41:13.225 --> 41:16.060
I will get some more bubbly.

41:16.062 --> 41:17.428
Okay.

41:17.430 --> 41:19.129
That was awesome.

41:23.401 --> 41:24.768
Hey! Just in time.

41:24.770 --> 41:26.603
How are you feeling?

41:26.605 --> 41:28.238
Feeling fine.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.940
Good, staff meeting
is cancelled on account

41:29.942 --> 41:31.675
of we are celebrating.

41:31.677 --> 41:32.943
The general sent the bubbly,

41:32.945 --> 41:34.311
Eddie R. and Ted sent some cohibas.

41:34.313 --> 41:35.512
Hank.

41:35.514 --> 41:37.514
Hank!

41:39.384 --> 41:40.751
I need to talk to you about something.

41:40.753 --> 41:43.420
Okay.

41:43.422 --> 41:45.989
Sure.

41:45.991 --> 41:47.424
What's up?

41:50.762 --> 41:55.099
Dr. Van Dyke didn't
administer the wrong medication

41:55.101 --> 41:57.101
to Mr. Kassabian.

42:00.438 --> 42:02.439
I did.

42:05.143 --> 42:07.144
It was my mistake.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.315
It was me.
