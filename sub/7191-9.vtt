WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:05.505
- Now, you give her a "so sorry
I was a meeny-weeny" present.

00:05.588 --> 00:06.923
- That?

00:07.006 --> 00:08.425
Why do I wanna
give her a present?

00:08.508 --> 00:09.676
I don't even like her.

00:09.759 --> 00:12.095
- You're pretending you do,
remember?

00:12.178 --> 00:15.098
We need her
weak and distracted.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.308
I wasn't expecting
so many witches in Miami.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.184
- Me, neither.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.187
Wait--
why do you have two?

00:21.271 --> 00:22.689
MIA: There are
two witches...

00:23.189 --> 00:24.858
Maddie and Emma.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.360
You'll give Emma
the necklace,

00:27.444 --> 00:28.987
and Katie will give
Maddie the bracelet.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.447
- Well, what about Jax?

00:30.530 --> 00:31.948
You're not
worried about him?

00:32.031 --> 00:34.367
- Nah, he'll run himself ragged
trying to save Emma.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.328
"Don't worry, Emma,
Jax to the rescue."

00:37.412 --> 00:40.790
- Spot-on impression.
What about the council?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.000
- Also distracted by the
commotion we're about to make.

00:42.083 --> 00:45.128
- So... what exactly
does this do?

00:45.211 --> 00:48.298
- This will
scramble her spells,

00:48.381 --> 00:50.175
giving me enough time
to destroy her.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.725
- Come on, Em,
he's an hour late.

00:58.808 --> 00:59.267
Leave already.

01:01.686 --> 01:04.730
DANIEL: There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

01:04.813 --> 01:06.399
EMMA: You said our secret place.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.276
I've been waiting here
for an hour.

01:08.359 --> 01:11.196
- Exactly.
Our secret place is the gym.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.238
- The gym?

01:12.322 --> 01:14.324
- Yes.
Lots of places to hide--

01:14.407 --> 01:16.242
under the bleachers,
behind the mats.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.702
- You don't
remember our place?

01:18.995 --> 01:20.330
- I didn't.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.373
My memory's all hazy
from the spider-bite thing.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.625
I-- I got confused.

01:23.708 --> 01:24.834
I'm sorry.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.170
- Don't be.
I'm the one who's sorry.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.505
I should've
thought of that.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.339
- It's okay.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.632
I made a surprise
for you.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.092
- It-- it's not like
your surprise performance

01:33.176 --> 01:34.928
at the Never-ending
Summer party, is it?

01:35.011 --> 01:37.847
- No, this is way better.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.182
I made the surprise.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.105
- You made that?
- Uh-huh.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.025
Daniel, it's beautiful.

01:49.567 --> 01:50.610
- Try it on?

SOPHIE: Don't worry!

02:34.195 --> 02:36.489
- Sophie, let go!

02:36.573 --> 02:38.157
- Great guard you are.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.367
- Soph, release.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.704
- Back to my post.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.540
- What do you want?

02:45.623 --> 02:47.041
- Can we talk?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.084
- Why don't you just go talk
to your best friend, Mia?

02:48.167 --> 02:51.838
- She's not my best friend.

02:51.921 --> 02:55.383
Come on, Maddie,
I'm trying to apologize.

02:55.466 --> 02:55.800
I miss you guys.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.594
- Aah.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.012
- Not you.

02:59.095 --> 03:02.265
I mean, including you.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.727
Anyway, I made you
a friendship bracelet...

03:06.561 --> 03:08.104
as a peace offering.

03:08.187 --> 03:12.191
- Wow! It's even better
than the one I saw at the mall.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.110
Look at that crystal.

03:14.193 --> 03:15.778
(chuckling)

03:15.862 --> 03:17.071
I'll have to
think about it.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.949
I dressed up as a fairy for you,
and you stood me up.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.201
- Just keep it,
I made it for you.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.291
- Don't you think
that was a little harsh?

03:29.125 --> 03:29.208
- No.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.670
Yes.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.839
Maybe.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.299
- Look at the bracelet
she made you.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.675
Now I don't have to
buy the other one.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.094
- Proxy!

03:40.178 --> 03:42.513
- I-- I just mean because
they'll-- they'll clash.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.265
Come on, Mad.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.100
She's your best friend.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.062
- You're right,
she is my best friend.

03:49.145 --> 03:52.315
And you are
an amazing boyfriend.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.695
I love it!

03:59.405 --> 04:00.406
Emma?

04:01.741 --> 04:02.283
Emma?

04:04.911 --> 04:05.828
(all screaming)

04:05.912 --> 04:08.122
- What are you doing here?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.207
- I don't know!
- Well, get lost!

04:09.290 --> 04:11.834
You're spoiling
a very special,

04:11.918 --> 04:13.336
very private moment.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.005
- Sorry, I-- I'm going...
right now.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.466
- What's the problem?

04:18.548 --> 04:20.343
- I don't know!

04:20.426 --> 04:21.260
(grunting)

04:21.344 --> 04:22.804
- What are you doing?

04:22.887 --> 04:24.263
- Emma, are you okay?

04:24.347 --> 04:26.724
- I don't know, I'm trying
to leave, but I can't.

04:26.808 --> 04:27.266
- Well, try harder!

04:30.979 --> 04:32.146
- Whoa!

04:32.230 --> 04:33.356
Witch-blitz--
get it?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.525
'Cause you guys
tried to tackle me,

04:35.608 --> 04:37.193
and you're both wi--

04:37.276 --> 04:39.487
Yeah, you got it.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.613
- What's going on?

04:40.697 --> 04:42.156
- Wait, wait, wait,
stay here.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.449
- Go to the window.
- Why?

04:43.533 --> 04:44.784
I don't wanna
go to the window.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.202
- Just go to
the window, please.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.707
Yeah, I think I know
what's happening.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.542
You guys are stuck together.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.002
BOTH: No!

04:54.669 --> 04:56.212
- Emma?

04:56.295 --> 04:57.839
JAX: Emma?

04:59.424 --> 05:01.551
What did you do to her?
- What are you doing here?

05:01.634 --> 05:02.885
Were you spying on us?

05:02.969 --> 05:06.097
- No. I was just walking by
on-- on my way to the--

05:06.180 --> 05:07.473
to the library.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.474
- You haven't been to a library
in your entire life.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.310
- Sure I have, I buy
magazines and--

05:11.394 --> 05:13.771
and gum from there
all the time.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.774
What happened to her?

05:16.858 --> 05:18.818
- She's probably
in some pool somewhere.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.069
You know how crummy she is
at tele-transporting.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.154
- What is wrong with you?

05:21.237 --> 05:24.282
- I wonder that
about you every day.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.121
- You are no longer free to
roam, Daniel, stay home.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.417
- We almost have it.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.300
- (groaning)

05:43.384 --> 05:43.801
- Whoa!

05:43.885 --> 05:45.261
- Daniel.

05:45.344 --> 05:49.307
- You jumped on
our prank.

05:49.390 --> 05:53.102
- Why do I have to stay over
at Maddie's on a school night?

05:53.186 --> 05:56.147
Uh, that's a
great question,

05:56.230 --> 05:59.275
and it deserves
an answer.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.486
It-- it's for...

06:01.569 --> 06:02.779
social studies.

06:02.862 --> 06:06.074
Yeah, we have
a baby simulator.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.408
It cries and eats
and sleeps,

06:07.492 --> 06:10.578
and we have to
take care of it all night.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.830
- Now, why is she here?

06:12.914 --> 06:15.875
- We're stuck together.
- What?

06:15.958 --> 06:17.418
- It's some kind of
annoying spell or something.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.379
If we get more than
five feet apart...

06:25.301 --> 06:26.469
this happens.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.596
- Oh, well,
that is...

06:29.680 --> 06:33.101
the most wonderful news
I've ever heard!

06:33.184 --> 06:36.104
- It is?
- Yes!

06:36.187 --> 06:38.523
- (imitating baby)
Waah! Waah! Waah!

06:38.606 --> 06:40.483
Gotta go,
the baby's crying.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.400
We get points off
if we let her cry.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.031
- Hi, Francisco? Hi.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.743
Oh, isn't it wonderful that
our girls are working together?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.954
It's like they're sisters.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.581
Why don't you stop by
tomorrow morning,

06:55.665 --> 06:56.499
and you can
pick her up.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.503
Oh, you have
an early meeting?

07:00.586 --> 07:01.629
4:00 a.m.?

07:01.712 --> 07:04.757
No, that's not
too early for me.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.301
- He bought it, and now let's
start going through

07:07.385 --> 07:08.594
your mom's magic books.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.971
- Why don't you just go get
the Hexasaurus?

07:10.054 --> 07:11.389
- He's sleeping over
at Andi's.

07:11.472 --> 07:12.557
She's going to check
if he knows anything.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.891
- (chuckling)

07:13.975 --> 07:15.601
You guys are so weird.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.354
- If we both go through them,
I'm sure we'll find something

07:18.437 --> 07:20.398
about what's making us
stick together.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.154
Look, I'm not staying up all
night reading dusty old books.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.531
No one cares if you
have bags under your eyes,

07:28.614 --> 07:30.241
but I'm head Panther.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.367
I need my
beauty sleep.

07:31.450 --> 07:34.829
We'll deal with it
in the morning.

07:34.912 --> 07:35.788
You're over there.

07:51.470 --> 07:52.889
- Come on!

07:52.972 --> 07:55.099
- No way!
I'm not a Panther.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.517
- Don't I know it.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.228
But until we can separate,
you have to get in formation.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.981
Get in Katie's position.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.816
- Sorry,
I just can't do it.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.235
- You're right.
how silly of me.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.988
Sophie, you've been promoted.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.741
You get into Katie's spot,
and Emma will go in yours.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.035
- (laughing)

08:17.997 --> 08:18.623
Uh, what are you doing?

08:18.706 --> 08:20.666
- I'm the new Katie.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.084
The clothes are
no problem,

08:22.168 --> 08:23.252
but the hair's
gonna take more time.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.796
Ooh!
I have an idea.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.759
- Good morning,
Pan... thers.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.344
- Temporarily.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.224
She's a guest Panther.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.433
- Jax!

08:40.311 --> 08:42.647
Stop moving!
- You first!

08:45.066 --> 08:46.859
- Same time?
- Fine!

08:47.485 --> 08:50.905
- One, two, and...

08:51.739 --> 08:52.198
Hey!

08:52.281 --> 08:54.200
- Seriously?

08:54.283 --> 08:55.701
Who falls for that?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.371
- Let's go to Lily,
she can help us.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.748
- I just came back from
my probation meeting with her.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.291
She just went
to the council.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.001
- We'll check
after first period.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.295
I'm off to history--
- But I have French class.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.589
- Oh, no, I didn't
think of that.

09:08.673 --> 09:09.966
- Let's go to history.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.968
(French accent)
I'm already "fluiella" French.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.886
Ooh-la-la.

09:13.970 --> 09:14.637
Sophie!

09:18.182 --> 09:20.476
- I raided the Drama Club's
costume supply.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.353
It's not exactly
like Katie's, but it'll do.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.981
- We don't need Katie anyway.

09:25.064 --> 09:25.982
- You're right.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.984
(speaking French)

09:28.067 --> 09:29.819
<i>- Olé!</i>

09:35.157 --> 09:36.075
Sophie, get it together.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.411
- Sorry, Maddie.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.997
Having long hair is
throwing my balance way off.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.334
- There's Mia,
I'm gonna go talk to her.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.669
- She doesn't look like
she's in a mood to talk.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.629
- I just need to get
close enough to smell her.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.260
- What are you guys doing?

09:54.343 --> 09:55.761
- Oh! Hey, Mia.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.514
I'm just taking in
this fresh...

09:58.597 --> 09:59.682
(inhaling deeply)

09:59.765 --> 10:01.517
hallway air.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.144
- You weren't coming over
to gloat about Daniel?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.855
- What? No.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.858
- I'm sure you're happy now
that he broke up with me.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.901
Said you two
have something special.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.069
- He said that?

10:12.153 --> 10:14.697
I-- I mean,
he said that?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.657
- Yeah, so, if you'll
excuse me.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.702
- Aah!

10:19.785 --> 10:21.370
- Stop moving.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.459
- So, what's the emergency?

10:26.542 --> 10:28.627
- Jax put some spell on me,
and now I'm...

10:30.880 --> 10:32.548
prisoner in
my own house.

10:32.631 --> 10:34.050
- Oh, that's so cool.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.844
It's like dog's with like,
invisible fences.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.512
I-- I mean, uh,

10:38.596 --> 10:42.016
h-how could Jax
do that to you?

10:42.099 --> 10:42.892
Poor doggy Daniel.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.226
- Ha-ha-ha,
very funny.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.854
You've gotta convince him
to let me out of here.

10:46.937 --> 10:47.813
- What, me?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.190
I think you mean Emma.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.524
- She can't know.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.611
I promised her I'd try to
get along with that...

10:53.694 --> 10:55.029
wombat.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.325
- What--
what's wrong?

10:59.408 --> 11:00.743
- I don't feel too good.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.079
- Hey, look, you don't
have to try to convince me.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.288
I'm not your mom.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.707
- I'm serious,
I feel weak.

11:08.000 --> 11:08.876
I think Jax
did something to me.

11:12.671 --> 11:13.839
- No spa residue.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.383
- You have to help us.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.926
My popularity goes down with
every sighting of us together.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.805
- Yeah, 'cause that's
the worst part of this.

11:20.888 --> 11:20.971
- Open.

11:23.057 --> 11:23.974
Hmm, it's clear.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.684
Good dental hygiene,
by the way.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.644
- Thanks.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.020
- Let us backtrack.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.940
Emma, what happened
just before you transported

11:31.023 --> 11:32.274
to Maddie's?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.777
- I was with Daniel,
we were at the dock, and then...

11:34.860 --> 11:36.612
- And then he gave you
that ugly necklace.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.823
- How do you
know about that?

11:38.906 --> 11:40.157
Were you spying on us?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.867
JAX: No, I was just--

11:41.951 --> 11:43.202
I was just protecting you.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.413
- Heh heh, and doing
a good job of it, too.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.081
- Wait, wait--
necklace, what necklace?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.043
- Oh, big whoop.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.711
The bracelet Katie gave me
has the same crystal,

11:52.795 --> 11:55.840
but it's way nicer.
- Wow...

11:55.923 --> 11:58.467
- Don't touch it!
- What is it?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.929
- Is that...
- Is that what?

12:02.012 --> 12:03.472
- How did they
get their hands on it?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.307
- On what?
- It can't be!

12:05.391 --> 12:06.642
ALL: What?

12:06.725 --> 12:08.561
- They're pieces of
the Cristal de Caballero.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.813
- No!
We have to get them off.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.148
- Why?
What does it do?

12:12.231 --> 12:14.567
- It-- it causes your powers
to go haywire.

12:14.650 --> 12:15.901
- Is that why we're
still stuck together?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.236
- I don't know why.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.362
- You cannot cast a spell.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.489
- One of you cast a spell--
- Agamemnon.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.868
- A small one
to test the, uh, uh--

12:23.951 --> 12:25.494
- Cristal de Caballero.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.495
- What she said.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.497
Go on, Miss Alonso.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.167
Cast a spell--
not in my direction--

12:31.250 --> 12:32.543
over there.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.839
- A small spell,
I can do one of those.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.674
I'll make something simple,
let's see a rose.

12:38.757 --> 12:38.924
(all screaming)

12:43.888 --> 12:45.723
- It hasn't progressed
too far yet,

12:45.806 --> 12:46.724
but it will
keep getting worse.

12:46.807 --> 12:51.520
Eventually,
just by casting a spell,

12:51.604 --> 12:53.689
you could destroy
the entire world.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.232
- You gotta have
something in here.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.318
Ah.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.156
(grunting)

13:03.782 --> 13:04.700
There.

13:04.783 --> 13:05.868
EMMA: (chuckling)

13:07.453 --> 13:08.662
- Oh.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.418
- How dare she?

13:14.502 --> 13:16.253
Katie is permanently banned
from the Panthers.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.713
And she can forget about
being our bridesmaid

13:17.796 --> 13:19.173
in our future wedding.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.257
- "Our wedding"?

13:20.341 --> 13:22.218
- Relax.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.594
In 10 to 12 years.

13:24.803 --> 13:25.888
- Excuse me!

13:25.971 --> 13:26.722
I can't be late
for chemistry.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.891
- I've got a free period.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.684
There's no way I'm
spending it in the lab.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.398
Hey, where have
you been?

13:36.482 --> 13:39.235
- Oh, you know,
here and there, and--

13:39.318 --> 13:40.277
Hey, Jax, ol' buddy.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.154
Ol' pal.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.740
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

13:45.658 --> 13:46.617
In private?

13:46.700 --> 13:47.743
- Why?
What are you gonna do to me?

13:47.826 --> 13:50.788
- What? Nothing.
Why would you think that?

13:50.871 --> 13:52.623
- Well, because last time you
said you wanted to talk

13:52.706 --> 13:55.960
in private, you gave me a noogie
so gnarly I had a bald spot.

13:57.044 --> 13:57.920
- Oh, yeah,
that was fun.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.838
We should try that
again sometime.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.423
- Andi,
what's going on?

14:02.758 --> 14:04.134
All right,
you know what,

14:04.218 --> 14:07.846
Daniel didn't want me
to tell you, but...

14:07.930 --> 14:08.806
Jax, can you finally
take the spell off of him

14:08.889 --> 14:10.933
so he can finally
leave his house?

14:11.016 --> 14:12.643
- You put a spell on Daniel?

14:12.726 --> 14:16.438
- I, uh, I-- I may have
pointed in his direction

14:16.522 --> 14:18.440
while accidentally
rhyming.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.192
- And now he's stuck
in his house?

14:20.276 --> 14:22.152
- Yeah, and not only that,
it's making him sick.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.571
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:23.654 --> 14:24.572
I-- I didn't do that.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.491
- Reverse the spell, now!

14:27.575 --> 14:29.034
- No, Em,
don't you see?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.120
He gave you the cursed necklace.
He's dangerous.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.372
- I'm sure there's
an explanation for it.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.873
Please, Jax.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.210
- Okay.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.087
- How do I know
you really did it?

14:45.092 --> 14:45.884
Happy now?

14:48.637 --> 14:50.639
- You...
- Daniel!

14:52.516 --> 14:53.517
(gasps)

14:58.439 --> 14:59.815
- It's not my spell.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.779
- All right, let's do this,
we haven't got much time.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.488
- Okay.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.783
- Okay, so risers here,

15:09.867 --> 15:13.287
and the branch lines go here,
here, and over here.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.496
- What's the static pressure?

15:14.580 --> 15:16.665
- 80 psi.
- Piece of cake.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.169
- Sure you wanna sit
with the enemy?

15:20.252 --> 15:22.671
Aren't you afraid that
I'm gonna poison your food?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.507
- Well, can't get
any more toxic than this.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.927
Look, Jax, uh,
I believe you.

15:29.011 --> 15:33.182
Even though you can be
wicked, shameless--

15:33.265 --> 15:35.517
- Okay, I've got it.
- Annoying, egotistical--

15:35.601 --> 15:36.852
- Get to the point.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.187
- I'm getting there.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.023
Look, I don't think
it's the spell

15:41.106 --> 15:42.941
that's making
Daniel sick.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.319
JAX: Then what is it?

15:45.402 --> 15:48.697
- Well, I'm just not buying that
he's cured of the spider seal.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.116
Look, the council said
that witches couldn't do it,

15:51.200 --> 15:52.409
and that was too easy.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.827
- You do have a point.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.287
- I think that we should
make sure

15:55.371 --> 15:56.538
that the spider seal's gone.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.791
We just have to
get Daniel alone.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.793
- Easy, I still have detention

16:00.876 --> 16:02.378
for fighting with him
in the hall.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.380
- Perfect-- now I just
have to figure out a way

16:04.463 --> 16:05.464
to get in there, too.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.803
- No problem.
ANDI: What? No!

16:14.556 --> 16:16.183
- Who was it?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.906
- I am so sorry,
Mr. Alonso.

16:30.989 --> 16:33.951
See, I was just practicing
my egg juggling, and whoops.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.953
- Oh, look at this.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.913
Maybe an afternoon
in detention

16:37.996 --> 16:40.290
will make you think twice
before doing it again.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.835
- Oh, man!
Detention?

16:42.918 --> 16:43.711
- Detention, today.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.547
Now, get to class!

16:55.013 --> 16:58.058
T3, where are you?

17:21.582 --> 17:25.002
<i>WOMAN: Principal Alonso,</i>
<i>please report to the office.</i>

17:25.085 --> 17:26.795
<i>The plumber is here to fix</i>
<i>the sprinkler system.</i>

17:26.878 --> 17:28.047
- I'll be right back.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.217
No talking.

17:35.929 --> 17:36.847
(door shuts)

17:36.930 --> 17:37.473
- Now what?

17:37.556 --> 17:39.683
- Um...

17:52.571 --> 17:54.490
- What was that?

17:54.573 --> 17:56.742
- What was what?
- My neck.

17:56.825 --> 18:00.954
- Um, it's probably just the--
the sprinkler system above you.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.748
Yeah, it's still
going off from earlier.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.214
- 4:30, right?

18:11.590 --> 18:12.883
I guess...

18:17.971 --> 18:21.767
- Ow!
Diego, too much!

18:21.850 --> 18:23.602
I feel like a piece
of burnt toast.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.478
- Sorry.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.313
- How much longer,
Lily?

18:26.396 --> 18:27.231
- Just about there.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.650
ANDI: Whoa!

18:29.733 --> 18:31.318
- It's like
a sauna in here.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.237
- We're attempting to free them
from the Cristal de Caballero.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.989
- Yeah, how? By making
us all sweat so much,

18:36.073 --> 18:38.200
the crystal runs away
from the stink?

18:38.283 --> 18:40.869
- The theory is the application
of the magic heat...

18:40.953 --> 18:41.703
(panting)

18:41.787 --> 18:44.414
will melt the bond.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.166
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.627
Uh, I-- I heard
that it does that.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.087
- No, you haven't.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.089
- You know--
you know what?

18:52.172 --> 18:53.549
We're officially
not partners anymore.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.342
- What are you
talking about?

18:55.425 --> 18:57.469
- We checked out Daniel and he
still has the spider seal.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.554
- What?

18:58.637 --> 19:00.764
- Yeah, and it's
made him so weak,

19:00.848 --> 19:02.391
he didn't even
wanna fight Jax.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.767
- Nah, that's just 'cause
he didn't wanna lose.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.228
- So, you think the seal
is what's making Daniel weak?

19:06.311 --> 19:09.231
- Probably.
It does that to witches.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.899
I always wondered
what would happen

19:10.983 --> 19:12.818
if a Kanay seal
landed on a human.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.862
- I guess we'll
finally find out.

19:14.945 --> 19:15.946
(both chuckling)

19:16.029 --> 19:17.573
- This is ground-breaking.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.075
- What? We have to get it off
of him before it's too late.

19:20.158 --> 19:21.326
- Okay, we're there.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.036
Let's see if
they can be separated.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.207
- You two, push
Emma's bed that way.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.960
Desdemona, you and I
will push Maddie's

19:30.043 --> 19:31.086
the other way.

19:31.169 --> 19:32.796
- I just had my nails done.

19:32.880 --> 19:33.213
JAX: I'll do it, come on.

19:43.807 --> 19:46.143
- It's working!

19:49.229 --> 19:49.313
- Oh.

19:57.487 --> 19:58.614
(knocking on door)

19:58.697 --> 20:00.240
<i>EMMA: Mia,</i>
<i>it's Emma and Maddie.</i>

20:00.324 --> 20:02.492
<i>MADDIE: Maddie and Emma.</i>

20:02.576 --> 20:03.660
<i>EMMA: Who cares</i>
<i>whose name is first?</i>

20:03.744 --> 20:04.828
<i>Never mind.</i>

20:04.912 --> 20:07.164
<i>Can we come down?</i>

20:07.247 --> 20:08.248
- Just a minute.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.676
Okay, come in.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.848
So, what are you doing here?

20:24.932 --> 20:26.058
Come to gloat?

20:26.141 --> 20:27.309
- No.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.144
We came to
tell you that...

20:29.895 --> 20:31.438
we know what you are.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.148
- "What I am"?

20:33.231 --> 20:34.358
You mean a
North Floridian?

20:34.441 --> 20:38.028
Well, you Miami people
are like, prejudiced.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.322
- Come on, Emma,
it's obvious

20:40.405 --> 20:41.907
she doesn't know what
you're talking about.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.493
Let's go.
- We don't want any trouble.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.787
Just take the crystals off us
and take the seal off Daniel.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.997
- Crystals?
Seal?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.833
I don't understand.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.252
A seal like,
"orf! orf!"

20:54.336 --> 20:55.712
Orf! Orf! Orf! Orf!

20:55.796 --> 20:57.798
- Wow...

20:57.881 --> 20:58.840
that was like,
a scary-good impression.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.426
- You know what I mean.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.803
The spider's making him
really sick.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.138
- Daniel's sick?

21:05.222 --> 21:05.973
- Yeah, and the longer
that spider's on him,

21:06.056 --> 21:07.933
the worse he's gonna get.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.310
- Spider bites can be bad.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.436
I hope he gets better.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.731
But I don't see what
it has to do with me.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.692
- This is useless.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.194
Come on, let's go...

21:19.278 --> 21:20.737
pal.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.166
