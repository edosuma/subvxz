He killed her.

- I mean, she
wasn't well-liked.

drama stuff.

Neither did any
of her neighbors.

Junior to kill her and why?

in the morning,

38:45.061 --> 38:47.586
- That's fair enough.

38:47.629 --> 38:50.328
80% of the crimes are
committed by 20% of the perps.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.721
- Okay.
The math is mathing.

38:52.765 --> 38:55.333
- So this Junior Suarez
thing--he gets paid

none of the other

So the money that
he sent to his sister

had to have been earned
from somewhere else.

bigger going on here

into this together.

need to go home.
