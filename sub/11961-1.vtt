<i>Where's she going?</i>

03:32.134 --> 03:34.125
Hello?

03:39.207 --> 03:41.198
Michael?

03:45.113 --> 03:47.604
Hello?

03:47.682 --> 03:49.616
Shh!

03:49.684 --> 03:51.618
- Jerk!
- What?

03:51.686 --> 03:54.655
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Oh, it was a joke.

03:54.723 --> 03:56.953
- Whatever. I'm going.
- Wait- No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

03:57.025 --> 03:59.823
Don't be like that.

03:59.895 --> 04:03.387
- This was supposed to be romantic.
- This is not romantic.

04:03.465 --> 04:06.901
This is creepy.
I'm freezing my ass off.

04:06.968 --> 04:09.027
Fine.
Then, uh...

04:09.104 --> 04:11.470
let's just-just forget it.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.838
Forget what?

04:15.911 --> 04:19.005
Happy birthday.

04:19.081 --> 04:21.481
Oh! It's not my birthday.

04:21.550 --> 04:23.643
I'm early.
I couldn't wait.

04:23.718 --> 04:27.518
Those are real diamonds,
in case you're wondering.

04:27.589 --> 04:29.819
It's too much.

04:29.891 --> 04:32.519
- Oh. Okay. Well, then I'll just take it back.
- No! No, no, no.

04:32.594 --> 04:36.052
No!
I love it.

04:40.135 --> 04:42.228
It's so beautiful.
Thank you.

04:59.454 --> 05:00.944
What's wrong?

05:01.022 --> 05:03.684
<i>Mmm.</i>

05:03.758 --> 05:05.783
You're hearing things again.

05:05.861 --> 05:09.160
No, no, no. L-
No, it's just a headache.

05:09.231 --> 05:11.699
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

05:11.766 --> 05:13.859
<i>- I just wanna get out of here, okay?
- Laurel!</i>

05:15.504 --> 05:18.803
<i>Dad.</i>

05:18.874 --> 05:20.967
Get in the car.

05:22.878 --> 05:24.971
Bye.

05:48.403 --> 05:50.394
Put some clothes on.

06:04.052 --> 06:06.020
What are you doing way up here?

06:06.087 --> 06:08.578
Did you follow me?

06:09.658 --> 06:12.126
I asked you to stay away from him.

06:12.194 --> 06:14.526
Michael and I are getting married.

06:17.732 --> 06:19.666
That's not gonna happen.

06:19.734 --> 06:22.430
I'll be 18 next week.
You can't stop us.

06:26.007 --> 06:27.941
You're gonna be 18.

06:28.009 --> 06:30.807
Why do you hate him so much?

06:30.879 --> 06:33.871
He has nothing to do with it.
I hate myself.

06:33.949 --> 06:39.216
<i>/ had so many plans for you.
Everything got spoiled.</i>

06:39.287 --> 06:42.552
- Dad, what are you-
- It was all my fault.

06:42.624 --> 06:44.819
I'm so sorry for what I did.

06:44.893 --> 06:46.827
Have you been drinking?
Dad-

06:46.895 --> 06:49.955
<i>- I didn't know what else to do.
- What are you talking about?</i>

06:50.031 --> 06:52.056
<i>Dad, can you slow down, please?
Dad!</i>

06:52.133 --> 06:54.658
<i>Watch the road!</i>

06:54.736 --> 06:57.830
- Just let me out of this car!
- The darkness is coming for you!

06:57.906 --> 07:00.898
Let me out! No!

07:00.976 --> 07:03.638
- No!
- Stop it!

07:03.712 --> 07:05.703
<i>Dad!</i>

07:05.780 --> 07:09.580
<i>I can't let you turn 18!</i>

07:09.651 --> 07:12.745
<i>- God, forgive me!
- Dad, don't!</i>

07:12.821 --> 07:15.051
Stop!

07:15.123 --> 07:17.717
Don't! Dad, don't!

07:41.082 --> 07:43.243
Daddy.

07:43.318 --> 07:46.845
<i>/- / don't understand.</i>

07:58.500 --> 08:00.866
God, forgive me.

08:04.172 --> 08:08.336
<i>/ couldn't let you turn 18.</i>

08:08.410 --> 08:11.106
<i>/ couldn't let them take you.</i>

09:05.567 --> 09:08.468
911. What's your emergency?

09:08.536 --> 09:12.597
911. Are you there?

09:12.674 --> 09:15.040
Hello?

09:42.270 --> 09:45.899
<i>You're up early.
Did you sleep okay?</i>

09:45.974 --> 09:48.238
Yeah.

09:48.309 --> 09:50.971
<i>You feelin'all right?</i>

09:51.045 --> 09:55.072
- This uniform makes me nauseous, if that's what you mean.
- I think you look pretty.

09:55.150 --> 09:57.641
You're not wearing your glasses.

09:59.721 --> 10:02.087
Even prettier.

10:03.491 --> 10:05.584
<i>/t's a good school, Molly.</i>

10:05.660 --> 10:08.254
It's one of the best in the state.
Promise me that...

10:08.329 --> 10:10.058
<i>you'll give it a chance.</i>

10:10.131 --> 10:12.065
<i>A fresh start, okay?</i>

10:12.133 --> 10:14.363
For both of us?

10:41.863 --> 10:44.127
Okay. Enjoy yourself.

10:45.433 --> 10:47.367
Yeah.

11:00.782 --> 11:04.309
<i>Mm-hmm.
Well...</i>

11:04.385 --> 11:06.649
you are an excellent student,
Miss Hartley.

11:06.721 --> 11:08.655
<i>/'m sure you'll find Huntington Prep...</i>

11:08.723 --> 11:11.248
<i>every bit as challenging
as your last school.</i>

11:11.326 --> 11:14.295
Your, uh, father...

11:14.362 --> 11:18.298
has requested an appointment
with our school counselor.

11:18.366 --> 11:22.234
<i>Dr. Emerson, Room 260, sixth period.</i>

11:22.303 --> 11:25.033
Come in.

11:25.106 --> 11:28.667
<i>Ah, Miss White.
Miss White, Miss Hartley.</i>

11:28.743 --> 11:32.338
<i>Miss White will escort you
to your classes.</i>

11:32.413 --> 11:34.347
"Nay, cursed be thou;
since against his thy will...

11:34.415 --> 11:36.246
chose freely what it now
so justly rues. "

11:36.317 --> 11:39.081
<i>Again with some feeling,
Mr. Young.</i>

11:40.488 --> 11:42.422
<i>"Nay, cursed be thou; since"-</i>

11:42.490 --> 11:46.324
Mr. Draper, this is Molly Hartley.
It's her first day.

11:46.394 --> 11:49.761
She's from Boston,
and she had a 4.0 at Filmore Prep.

11:49.831 --> 11:52.629
<i>Welcome, Miss Hartley from Boston.</i>

11:52.700 --> 11:56.500
- Thank you.
- Any other pertinent information we should know about?

11:56.571 --> 11:58.664
Hobbies?
Food allergies, maybe?

11:58.740 --> 12:02.198
<i>/'m kidding. A II right. Take a seat then.</i>

12:02.277 --> 12:04.768
<i>We're in the middle
of Paradise Lost.</i>

12:06.848 --> 12:09.476
We can share.

12:13.855 --> 12:16.016
Jealous.

12:16.090 --> 12:17.887
Excuse me?

12:17.959 --> 12:22.555
<i>- Ladies, are we done?
- Yes, I'm done.</i>

12:22.630 --> 12:25.394
Can we continue?

12:25.466 --> 12:29.368
<i>- Mr. Young, keep reading.
- "Which way / flie is Hell,;my self am Hell. "</i>

12:31.573 --> 12:35.441
Do you want pizza?
Or maybe a sandwich?

12:36.711 --> 12:38.702
It's my treat.

12:44.118 --> 12:46.712
Don't worry.
They're not laughing at you.

12:48.356 --> 12:50.688
People make fun of me
because I'm on scholarship...

12:50.758 --> 12:53.056
not that it's any of their business.

12:54.896 --> 12:57.228
And some people are offended
because I have a close...

12:57.298 --> 12:59.926
personal relationship with Jesus.

13:01.736 --> 13:04.728
<i>Doesn't bother me.</i>

13:06.441 --> 13:08.739
Are you okay?

13:10.945 --> 13:13.675
<i>Molly?</i>

13:15.516 --> 13:18.246
I'll be right back.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.412
<i>- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.</i>

13:51.219 --> 13:53.983
You can't hide in here
all day, you know.

13:54.055 --> 13:55.647
Believe me.

13:55.723 --> 13:57.714
I've tried.

14:04.999 --> 14:07.991
<i>¶ Do you know who / am ¶</i>

14:08.069 --> 14:10.902
<i>¶ /'m alive, you understand ¶</i>

14:10.972 --> 14:15.807
<i>¶ Alive, alive, alive ¶</i>

14:18.279 --> 14:21.339
<i>¶ Check your head
/ heard a sound ¶</i>

14:21.416 --> 14:25.011
<i>¶ Makes so tender arms around ¶</i>

14:25.086 --> 14:29.580
<i>¶ The sound, the sound, the sound ¶</i>

15:11.532 --> 15:14.729
Whoa! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

15:14.802 --> 15:17.066
Are you okay?

15:17.138 --> 15:19.538
I'm Joseph Young, from English class?

15:19.607 --> 15:22.405
- Yeah. I remember.
- Yeah.

15:22.477 --> 15:25.503
- Usually I'm pretty good at this.
- At what?

15:25.580 --> 15:28.378
Flirting, I guess.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.644
No one normally gets hurt though.

15:30.718 --> 15:33.414
I am fine.
No permanent damage.

15:33.488 --> 15:35.012
Good.

15:35.089 --> 15:38.388
Ditching class on the first day, I see.
That's pretty bold.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.895
- I don't have a sixth period.
- Everyone has sixth period.

15:44.398 --> 15:46.593
Okay, I get it.
Woman of mystery.

15:46.667 --> 15:50.068
So what are you doing right now?
You wanna go grab something to eat or what?

15:51.839 --> 15:53.773
What about that girl from class?

15:53.841 --> 15:57.607
- Who, Suzie?
- She's your girlfriend, right?

15:57.678 --> 16:00.272
Well, hey, we can be friends.
Everyone needs friends, right?

16:00.348 --> 16:02.612
I'm new. I don't need
that kind of trouble.

16:02.683 --> 16:05.516
Okay.

16:08.756 --> 16:10.587
<i>/ have to get home.</i>

16:12.326 --> 16:14.624
Uh, wait.
I can give you a ride if you want.

16:14.695 --> 16:16.686
No, thanks.

16:17.765 --> 16:20.529
I'll see you in school tomorrow then.

16:46.250 --> 16:49.048
- So?
- So?

16:49.120 --> 16:51.714
How was the first day of school?

16:51.789 --> 16:53.620
How was the first day of work?

16:53.691 --> 16:56.785
Ah, it was busy.
Lots of meetings.

16:56.861 --> 16:58.795
Bad coffee.

16:58.863 --> 17:00.626
Same here.

17:01.966 --> 17:03.900
Did you see the school counselor?

17:05.301 --> 17:07.463
Yeah.
He was fine.

17:07.538 --> 17:10.871
School's fine.
Everything was fine.

17:10.941 --> 17:13.171
Well, I was hopin'
things would be better than fine.

17:13.243 --> 17:15.769
You know, maybe good...
or promising.

17:15.846 --> 17:18.541
Stop acting like
everything is all right.

17:18.616 --> 17:20.550
It's never going to be all right.

17:20.617 --> 17:24.748
<i>- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me.</i>

17:24.821 --> 17:28.588
<i>/ am doing my best
to keep this family together...</i>

17:28.659 --> 17:31.389
and I expect you to do the same.

17:34.432 --> 17:36.798
Can she get out?

17:36.867 --> 17:38.858
<i>Hmm?</i>

17:40.671 --> 17:42.832
Can she get out of that place?

17:42.907 --> 17:46.809
She's sick. But there's a chance that
she could get well. And if that happens-

17:46.877 --> 17:50.404
<i>/ wanna know that she can't get out.
/ wanna know that she's locked up forever.</i>

17:50.481 --> 17:52.472
<i>She can't hurt you, Molly, / promise.</i>

17:52.550 --> 17:56.350
No one is ever gonna hurt you again.
I won't let that happen.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.411
<i>All right?</i>

18:00.458 --> 18:03.757
<i>/f you ever change your mind,
if you ever feel like seeing her...</i>

18:03.828 --> 18:06.558
you know,
that would be okay too.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.564
No.

18:08.632 --> 18:10.623
She's still your mother.

18:12.703 --> 18:15.194
I'm not hungry.

18:15.272 --> 18:18.503
Do you-
You want me to make you something else?

18:18.576 --> 18:20.669
I need to start my homework.

19:14.265 --> 19:17.496
- Mom?
- Molly.

19:20.304 --> 19:24.764
Honey, come pray with me.
Pray.

19:24.842 --> 19:27.208
Pray, Molly!

19:27.278 --> 19:30.076
I renounce his works and give my life to you.
Please fill me with your Holy Spirit.

19:30.147 --> 19:32.877
Pray, Molly.
Pray!

19:32.950 --> 19:37.387
Forgive me.
I have... sinned?

19:37.454 --> 19:39.820
You know I love you.

19:42.192 --> 19:46.253
I'm sorry,
but I know what you are now.

19:46.330 --> 19:48.764
And it's the only way.
You understand, don't you?

19:48.832 --> 19:52.359
No.

19:52.436 --> 19:55.928
Close your eyes, Molly. I can save you.

20:08.986 --> 20:10.977
<i>Molly, you awake?</i>

20:12.222 --> 20:14.213
Yeah!

20:30.474 --> 20:33.637
<i>¶ You're the one that keeps drivin'me crazy ¶</i>

20:33.711 --> 20:35.770
<i>¶ Keeps pushin'me all the time ¶</i>

20:35.846 --> 20:38.644
<i>¶ /'m the one who wants
to be more lazy ¶</i>

20:38.716 --> 20:41.344
<i>¶ Sick of workin'it

20:41.418 --> 20:44.182
<i>¶ Whoa-oa-oa-oa ¶</i>

20:44.254 --> 20:46.779
<i>¶ Whoa-oa-oa ¶</i>

20:46.857 --> 20:49.758
<i>- ¶¶
- Hi.</i>

20:49.827 --> 20:52.796
All right, take a seat.

20:52.863 --> 20:56.390
<i>Well, after reading your papers
on Paradise Lost over the weekend...</i>

20:56.467 --> 20:59.129
I've decided to revise
the lesson plans a bit.

20:59.203 --> 21:01.569
Pass these back.

21:01.639 --> 21:04.301
<i>- Check it out.
- The Bible?</i>

21:04.375 --> 21:07.640
This isn't to be read
in a religious context.

21:07.711 --> 21:10.737
But it occurs to me many of you
don't have the necessary reference points...

21:10.814 --> 21:15.683
to fully appreciate these iconic texts
of English literature.

21:15.753 --> 21:18.347
So, Leah, we're all gonna do
a little extra reading.

21:18.422 --> 21:23.291
Look, my parents don't pay a shitload
of tuition for me to get stuck in Bible camp.

21:23.360 --> 21:27.524
Your parents pay for an excellent education,
which is exactly what I'm giving you.

21:27.598 --> 21:31.364
Hmm.
Thanks, but no thanks.

21:32.903 --> 21:34.734
Yes, Alexis?

21:34.805 --> 21:37.638
<i>- I already have a Bible. I don't need this one.
- Well, just to keep things clear...</i>

21:37.708 --> 21:41.337
we're all gonna use the same edition
just like all of our other texts.

21:41.412 --> 21:43.403
I'm not comfortable with that.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.710
I'm sorry?

21:45.783 --> 21:48.809
I don't feel comfortable talking
about the Bible as some sort of text.

21:48.886 --> 21:53.687
It's the word of God, not some morally
questionable novel you give us a pop quiz on.

21:53.757 --> 21:56.726
- Jesus freak.
- That's enough.

21:56.794 --> 22:00.059
It's sacrilegious.
It's profane.

22:00.130 --> 22:03.327
<i>Alexis, / appreciate your beliefs. / do.</i>

22:03.400 --> 22:06.733
<i>You need to learn to navigate in the
secular world if you wanna succeed here.</i>

22:06.804 --> 22:09.272
I can navigate in the secular world
without questioning my beliefs.

22:09.339 --> 22:12.331
<i>/ don't see why we have to talk about this
as if it's an opinion. /t's the truth.</i>

22:12.409 --> 22:14.343
L-

22:14.411 --> 22:16.572
<i>Molly, do you have something to add?</i>

22:22.653 --> 22:24.280
You're bleeding.

22:27.524 --> 22:29.458
<i>Here.</i>

22:29.526 --> 22:31.551
<i>You may be excused.</i>

22:32.963 --> 22:35.090
All right,
open to the Book of Psalms.

22:35.165 --> 22:38.726
<i>- And Leah's gonna lead us through it.
- /s this extra credit?</i>

22:42.573 --> 22:44.564
<i>Molly?</i>

22:50.214 --> 22:52.205
Hello?

22:54.418 --> 22:56.409
<i>Molly?</i>

23:11.235 --> 23:13.169
<i>- Molly?
- Hello?</i>

23:13.237 --> 23:15.501
<i>Molly?</i>

23:15.572 --> 23:18.473
<i>- Who's there?
- Molly?</i>

23:20.978 --> 23:23.105
Hello?

23:30.387 --> 23:34.790
<i>Molly? Molly? Molly, where are you?</i>

23:34.858 --> 23:36.348
<i>Molly?</i>

23:46.370 --> 23:48.702
<i>Molly?</i>

23:48.772 --> 23:51.400
Molly? Are you okay?

23:51.475 --> 23:55.377
<i>L- I brought you a clean shirt.</i>

23:55.445 --> 23:59.006
- Molly, what's happening?
- I can't- I can't-

23:59.082 --> 24:02.108
<i>Somebody, help!</i>

24:09.660 --> 24:13.858
Are you feeling better?
I was off campus at a meeting.

24:13.931 --> 24:15.990
I'm Dr. Emerson.

24:16.066 --> 24:19.558
I guess you got sidetracked on your way
to our appointment yesterday.

24:19.636 --> 24:22.104
I understand.

24:22.172 --> 24:25.039
I imagine it must be overwhelming
on your first day of classes...

24:25.108 --> 24:27.042
but your father insisted.

24:27.110 --> 24:29.305
- He worries a lot.
- I hope you don't mind.

24:29.379 --> 24:31.711
It's still technically sealed.

24:31.782 --> 24:34.342
But everything stays between
you and me, all right?

24:35.819 --> 24:37.753
I don't need to be here.

24:37.821 --> 24:41.552
Heard you had a panic attack in class today.
You wanna tell me about it?

24:41.625 --> 24:43.593
It was just a nosebleed.

24:43.660 --> 24:46.686
Just got freaked out
by all the blood, that's all.

24:46.763 --> 24:51.200
Must be hard being new at school
even under the best of circumstances.

24:51.268 --> 24:54.465
<i>/'m new here too.
/t's hard for me.</i>

24:54.538 --> 24:56.904
How are you feeling otherwise?

24:56.974 --> 24:59.772
Whatever it says in there,
I'm not like her.

24:59.843 --> 25:03.244
<i>We're not suggesting that, Molly.
Our only concern is you.</i>

25:03.313 --> 25:06.544
Well, I told you, I'm fine.

25:07.651 --> 25:09.585
Your mother stabbed you
in the chest...

25:09.653 --> 25:11.587
with a pair of scissors.

25:11.655 --> 25:13.953
There was no sign of mental illness...

25:14.024 --> 25:15.855
<i>no warning.</i>

25:15.926 --> 25:17.860
I don't remember, okay?

25:17.928 --> 25:21.455
<i>Everyone keeps asking me what happened,
and / don't remember.</i>

25:21.531 --> 25:25.729
<i>- She's locked up, and she can't get out.
- Are you interested in knowing...</i>

25:25.802 --> 25:28.134
what her diagnosis is?

25:33.410 --> 25:35.844
<i>"Probable psychotic disorder.</i>

25:35.913 --> 25:37.972
"Signs of paranoid schizophrenia...

25:38.048 --> 25:41.984
or a schizo-affective disorder
accompanied by a bipolar disorder. "

25:42.052 --> 25:44.816
I get it.
She's crazy.

25:44.888 --> 25:47.254
It's okay to be scared, Molly.

25:47.324 --> 25:48.916
What?

25:48.992 --> 25:51.460
Of developing the same symptoms.

25:51.528 --> 25:55.123
<i>There is a genetic component
to this disease.</i>

25:55.198 --> 25:58.167
We're gonna keep an eye on you.

25:58.235 --> 26:00.396
We're not gonna let anything
happen to you.

27:18.949 --> 27:20.746
Books?

27:20.817 --> 27:25.220
<i>You're lookin'up shit in books?
/sn't that what computers are for?</i>

27:25.288 --> 27:29.725
Uh, compu-
Schools, um, track...

27:29.793 --> 27:31.818
everything you look up
on the computer.

27:31.895 --> 27:34.193
You know, standard procedure.

27:34.264 --> 27:37.825
Well, I guess I didn't peg you
as the paranoid type.

27:39.503 --> 27:41.198
I'm not.

27:41.271 --> 27:44.900
I just don't like people
keeping a record of my thoughts.

27:44.975 --> 27:47.000
Oh.

27:47.077 --> 27:50.843
<i>"Medical Diagnostic Manual
of Mental Disorders"?</i>

27:50.914 --> 27:52.848
What?
You don't need this.

27:52.916 --> 27:54.884
I can diagnose you.

27:54.951 --> 27:57.613
Yeah. Ooh.

27:57.687 --> 28:00.451
This is not good.
It's, um...

28:00.524 --> 28:02.458
Ebola.

28:05.295 --> 28:07.593
- Good call.
- Yeah, well, it was, uh...

28:07.664 --> 28:09.655
kind of the nosebleed
that gave you away.

28:09.733 --> 28:11.667
Yeah.

28:11.735 --> 28:14.795
- Too bad you only have six hours to live.
- Too bad.

28:14.871 --> 28:17.965
Well, maybe now,
you'll let me give you a ride home...

28:18.041 --> 28:20.236
since we don't have
that much time left.

28:24.281 --> 28:29.116
Since it's terminal,
I guess I can make an exception.

28:29.186 --> 28:32.246
Well, good.
Let's go.

28:34.624 --> 28:36.558
<i>So are you good friends
with that Alexis girl?</i>

28:36.626 --> 28:38.856
No. Why?

28:38.929 --> 28:41.557
I don't know.
Just wondering.

28:41.631 --> 28:43.792
She's nice to me, that's all.

28:43.867 --> 28:46.802
Nice?
I can be nice.

28:46.870 --> 28:48.770
Hey.

28:48.839 --> 28:52.331
- What the hell happened?
- Nothing.

28:52.409 --> 28:54.468
You had a nosebleed.
You started hyperventilating.

28:54.544 --> 28:56.102
You had a panic attack.
That's nothing?

28:56.179 --> 28:58.807
I'll just see you tomorrow, Molly.
It's fine.

28:58.882 --> 29:00.816
Molly, how do you think
that makes me feel-

29:00.884 --> 29:04.843
to know that my daughter is hurt
and bleeding and won't even call me?

29:24.074 --> 29:27.339
I'm sorry. I-I overreacted.

29:27.410 --> 29:31.107
I'm worried about you, that's all.

29:31.181 --> 29:33.172
You never used to worry.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.309
You never paid attention to me at all.

29:35.385 --> 29:37.683
Stop trying to control my life.

29:37.754 --> 29:40.518
I'm not trying
to control your life.

29:50.467 --> 29:53.027
You went to see her?

29:53.103 --> 29:55.571
She's my wife.

29:57.574 --> 30:00.566
You need to tell me when you're not
feeling well. I need to know.

30:00.644 --> 30:04.512
What?
You need to know if I'm crazy too?

30:04.581 --> 30:06.378
Sweetie, you are not crazy.

30:06.449 --> 30:10.010
My head hurts. I hear things.
Everything's mixed up.

30:10.086 --> 30:11.986
I just-

30:14.724 --> 30:16.919
It was all my fault.

30:18.995 --> 30:21.259
Look, tomorrow I'll make
an appointment with a doctor, okay?

30:21.331 --> 30:24.767
We'll get you checked out.
I know that everything is gonna be fine.

30:30.407 --> 30:33.535
We're gonna get through this.
Okay?

32:03.500 --> 32:06.594
<i>Molly?</i>

32:10.774 --> 32:12.765
Oh, shit.

32:31.094 --> 32:33.119
<i>Molly?</i>

32:38.146 --> 32:40.080
<i>Molly?</i>

32:44.019 --> 32:46.510
<i>/ know what you are, Molly.</i>

32:50.258 --> 32:53.921
Wait! Daddy!

32:53.995 --> 32:55.690
Daddy, help!
Let me out!

32:55.764 --> 32:57.664
Molly, what's going on?

32:57.732 --> 33:00.667
Daddy, let me out! Dad!

33:00.735 --> 33:03.670
Molly! Molly!

33:03.738 --> 33:08.368
Daddy! Daddy!

33:23.358 --> 33:26.725
<i>Molly? Molly, do you know where you are?</i>

33:28.897 --> 33:30.865
Molly, are you with me?

33:30.932 --> 33:33.958
Easy. Easy.
Just relax.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.733
How did-
What's going on?

33:40.809 --> 33:42.970
You're in the hospital.
Everything's all right, baby.

33:43.044 --> 33:45.877
- You're gonna be fine.
- How long have you been having nosebleeds?

33:45.947 --> 33:49.474
A while, since before Mom-

33:49.551 --> 33:53.988
Have you been experiencing vision problems?
Headaches? Dizziness?

33:57.158 --> 34:01.094
See this little spot?
It's most likely a tumor...

34:01.162 --> 34:02.754
<i>in your sinus cavity.</i>

34:02.831 --> 34:05.299
<i>A nasal hemangioma.
A little mass ofblood vessels...</i>

34:05.366 --> 34:08.233
<i>growing out of control and creating
a whole lot of pressure in your head.</i>

34:08.303 --> 34:12.569
That would explain the nosebleeds,
the headaches and the vision problems.

34:12.639 --> 34:16.871
What about... hearing things?

34:16.945 --> 34:18.411
<i>Can that happen too?</i>

34:18.480 --> 34:21.745
Sometimes the buildup of pressure
can cause episodes of vertigo...

34:21.815 --> 34:24.978
or auditory hallucinations, disorientation.

34:25.053 --> 34:29.080
I thought I was going crazy.

34:29.157 --> 34:32.251
We caught it early,
so there's nothing to worry about.

34:32.327 --> 34:35.387
These things are pesky,
but usually benign.

34:35.463 --> 34:37.761
<i>We'll do an endoscopic procedure...</i>

34:37.831 --> 34:39.925
<i>and monitor you for a few days.</i>

34:40.001 --> 34:42.525
<i>You don't mind missing
a little school, do you?</i>

34:42.603 --> 34:45.471
Good. I'll schedule the surgery
for tomorrow morning.

34:45.540 --> 34:47.531
Get some rest.

34:49.444 --> 34:52.242
You see?
Everything's gonna be all right now.

34:52.313 --> 34:55.146
Everything's gonna be absolutely fine.

35:34.155 --> 35:36.089
Is my dad here?

35:39.828 --> 35:42.160
Is there any water?

35:42.230 --> 35:44.528
I know what you are.

35:44.599 --> 35:47.500
It's okay. It's okay. You're okay.

35:47.569 --> 35:50.060
You're out of surgery now, sweetie.
Everything went really well.

35:50.138 --> 35:53.665
There was no complications.
The tumor's benign.

35:53.741 --> 35:55.675
She was here.

35:55.743 --> 35:57.335
- Who?
- Mom.

35:57.412 --> 35:59.004
No, it's just you and me.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.877
I saw her.
She tried-

36:00.949 --> 36:02.974
No, it's just the anaesthesia.

36:05.587 --> 36:08.488
Just go and relax.
Lie back down.

36:08.556 --> 36:10.888
I don't suppose you feel like
having a visitor?

36:12.694 --> 36:15.993
- A visitor?
- Yeah, a friend from school came to see you.

36:21.569 --> 36:24.333
<i>Oh.</i>

36:24.405 --> 36:27.169
You want me to tell her to come back
when you're feeling better?

36:27.242 --> 36:29.176
No. It's okay.

36:29.244 --> 36:32.179
Okay. Come in.

36:36.251 --> 36:39.812
I'm gonna go scrounge up a decent meal.
You girls want anything?

36:39.888 --> 36:43.153
A pizza, or chili cheese fries?

36:43.224 --> 36:45.158
No, thanks, Mr. Hartley.

36:45.226 --> 36:49.686
Okay. Okay.
I'll be right back.

36:49.764 --> 36:52.358
- Your dad seems really nice.
- Yeah.

36:55.703 --> 36:57.637
My grandmother works in a hospital.

36:57.705 --> 36:59.730
She says flowers
make all the difference.

36:59.807 --> 37:02.173
How did you know I was here?

37:02.243 --> 37:06.907
Everyone at Huntington knows everything.
No secrets.

37:08.349 --> 37:11.512
- You're big news. But don't worry about it.
- What do you mean?

37:13.321 --> 37:15.721
I brought some homework assignments.

37:15.790 --> 37:18.224
Thought I could help you catch up.

37:18.293 --> 37:20.386
Why are you so nice to me?

37:22.830 --> 37:26.527
Molly, can I ask you a question?

37:26.601 --> 37:29.434
<i>Sure.</i>

37:29.504 --> 37:31.438
Have you been saved?

37:33.341 --> 37:36.504
The doctor caught the tumor early.
I'm fine.

37:36.577 --> 37:38.875
That's not what I mean.

37:38.947 --> 37:41.142
Oh. Right.

37:41.215 --> 37:43.911
Have you been baptized?

37:46.354 --> 37:50.791
- My parents don't believe in that sort of thing.
- Well, what about you?

37:50.858 --> 37:53.656
This is your life, your journey.

37:53.728 --> 37:55.662
What do you believe?

37:59.367 --> 38:01.892
I'm just worried about you, that's all.

38:01.970 --> 38:04.165
I'm feeling a little tired.

38:04.238 --> 38:07.298
I brought this for you.

38:14.916 --> 38:16.747
Thanks.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.911
Sure.

38:27.362 --> 38:29.990
I pray for you every night.

38:40.775 --> 38:42.709
<i>How do you feel?</i>

38:42.777 --> 38:46.577
- Good.
- Your birthday's coming up. What about a party?

38:46.647 --> 38:48.638
A party?

38:49.884 --> 38:52.045
Cake, presents, a clown.

38:52.120 --> 38:54.418
No clown.

38:54.489 --> 38:58.220
You know, time rushes by
like you wouldn't believe, Molly.

38:58.292 --> 39:00.726
I mean, just yesterday
you were a little thing in pigtails.

39:00.795 --> 39:04.993
And suddenly, you're 18.
All grown up.

39:05.066 --> 39:07.330
You won't need me anymore.

39:07.402 --> 39:10.565
Don't worry.
I'll need you.

39:23.918 --> 39:25.943
<i>¶¶</i>

39:33.127 --> 39:37.359
¶ Oh, the blood ofJesus ¶

39:37.432 --> 39:41.664
¶ Washes away ¶

39:41.736 --> 39:44.204

39:44.272 --> 39:48.572
<i>Alexis, enough with
the musical interlude, please.</i>

39:50.978 --> 39:53.811
<i>- Sorry.
- Thank you.</i>

39:56.050 --> 39:59.577
I'm so glad you're back.
There's a calculus quiz tomorrow.

39:59.654 --> 40:02.145
<i>My grandma said / can
come over tonight and help you study.</i>

40:02.223 --> 40:03.815
Okay.

40:03.891 --> 40:07.383
- Um, I'll see you in a few minutes.
- All right.

40:07.462 --> 40:09.362
Hey.

40:09.430 --> 40:12.524
- Welcome back.
- Thanks. Nice catch.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.864
I didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

40:14.936 --> 40:18.394
I would've definitely milked that " brain
surgery" thing for, like, a month off, maybe two.

40:18.473 --> 40:22.876
It wasn't actually brain surgery.

40:22.944 --> 40:26.072
- You're better now, right? Aren't you?
- I'm fine.

40:26.147 --> 40:28.741
Great. Then you can come
to my party tonight.

40:28.816 --> 40:31.307
Tonight?
It's a Tuesday.

40:31.385 --> 40:34.218
Exactly. It's a Tuesday,
and my parents are out of town.

40:34.288 --> 40:37.257
I don't know.
Maybe.

40:37.325 --> 40:39.657
Well, you'll need the secret code.

40:39.727 --> 40:42.719
A secret code?

40:42.797 --> 40:44.890
Just for the gate.

40:44.966 --> 40:46.957
Can't be too careful.

40:48.636 --> 40:51.264
Oh, and bring anyone you want
as long as it's not a guy.

40:51.339 --> 40:53.330
<i>Yo, yo, let's go!</i>

40:55.710 --> 40:58.702
Wait! Where do you live?

41:04.919 --> 41:08.082
Molly.
Are you feeling better?

41:08.156 --> 41:11.250
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Aw.

41:11.325 --> 41:14.055
I hope it wasn't too serious.

41:14.128 --> 41:16.096
No.

41:16.164 --> 41:18.257
So what were you and Joseph
talking about?

41:19.800 --> 41:23.463
- Nothing. We're just friends.
- Of course.

41:23.538 --> 41:28.601
It must be really difficult
to... be in your situation.

41:30.244 --> 41:32.303
What's that supposed to mean?

41:35.049 --> 41:38.883
He doesn't really want you to come.

41:38.953 --> 41:42.980
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I didn't even see you there.

41:43.057 --> 41:45.287
You're a bitch.

41:45.359 --> 41:47.554
I know.

41:48.963 --> 41:51.363
God, I hate her.

41:52.667 --> 41:55.693
Do you wanna eat?

41:57.205 --> 41:59.139
<i>So, are you gonna go?</i>

41:59.207 --> 42:02.074
- To the party?
- Yeah, to the party.

42:04.378 --> 42:06.312
I don't know if I wanna go.

42:06.380 --> 42:09.008
Yeah, you do. You wanna go,
and you wanna take me with you.

42:09.083 --> 42:11.017
You wanna go to the party?

42:11.085 --> 42:13.246
Please.
It's not like I even care.

42:13.321 --> 42:16.688
It's just-
You know, it's something to do.

42:16.757 --> 42:20.921
Come on. You can't tell me
you're not bored out of your mind here.

42:20.995 --> 42:23.862
You can count, right?

42:23.931 --> 42:26.900
- So then what's your curfew for tonight?
- Curfew?

42:26.968 --> 42:28.595
Molly!

42:28.669 --> 42:32.503
- Over here.
- I don't, um-

42:32.573 --> 42:38.273
I don't really do the cafeteria thing.
So... call me later.

42:40.448 --> 42:42.916
Ditch the Bible thumper.

42:46.053 --> 42:51.252
<i>¶¶</i>

42:52.426 --> 42:54.360
<i>Molly?</i>

42:54.428 --> 42:58.228
<i>Hello?</i>

42:59.800 --> 43:02.462
Where did you say you were going?

43:02.536 --> 43:04.629
Um, study group.

43:05.973 --> 43:07.907
<i>/t might go a little late.</i>

43:07.975 --> 43:11.570
Um, we have a big test tomorrow.
Calculus.

43:11.646 --> 43:13.580
Are you sure you're up for this?

43:13.648 --> 43:17.140
You're the one who said
I was perfectly fine, remember?

43:17.218 --> 43:19.914
Plus, I need to catch up.

43:22.723 --> 43:26.124
- Not too late.
- Not too late. Got it.

43:26.193 --> 43:29.253
<i>¶ Oh, let the sky be gray ¶</i>

43:29.330 --> 43:32.561
<i>¶ 'Cause if it's ever
gonna get any better¶</i>

43:32.633 --> 43:35.397
<i>¶ /t's gotta get worse for a day ¶¶</i>

43:40.508 --> 43:43.341
Let's go.

43:43.411 --> 43:45.641
Hey.

43:45.713 --> 43:49.342
You forgettin' somethin'?

43:49.417 --> 43:52.250
Dad, this is Leah.
This is my dad.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.948
<i>- Hey, Dad.
- /t's nice to meet you, Leah.</i>

43:55.022 --> 43:59.516
- Make sure she doesn't study too hard.
- Yeah, that won't be a problem.

43:59.593 --> 44:02.756
Okay.
Keep your phone on.

44:07.835 --> 44:09.826
Nice outfit.

44:13.941 --> 44:15.602
Better.

44:18.813 --> 44:21.008
Do you know where he lives?

44:21.082 --> 44:24.017
Come on. Everybody knows
whereJoseph Young lives.

44:24.085 --> 44:27.213
His father owns, like, half the city.
You didn't know that?

44:27.288 --> 44:29.222
No.

44:29.290 --> 44:32.225
Well, Suzie's not gonna let you
have him without a fight, so-

44:32.293 --> 44:34.523
Who says I want him?

44:34.595 --> 44:37.189
Yeah. Okay.
That was convincing. Good job.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.392
I saw you in Emerson's office
the other day.

44:43.504 --> 44:45.438
Oh, really?

44:45.506 --> 44:48.031
So what, does that mean
we're sharing now?

44:48.109 --> 44:52.569
Should we read each other's journals
and promise to be best friends forever?

44:55.449 --> 44:58.816
I have- I have anger issues.

45:00.254 --> 45:05.590
My father died
of throat cancer last year.

45:05.659 --> 45:09.755
<i>Then when he's dead / find out
he's not even really my father.</i>

45:09.830 --> 45:12.765
Turns out I'm adopted.

45:12.833 --> 45:15.927
My real parents, they gave me up.

45:16.003 --> 45:19.063
<i>Theyjust didn't
feel like keeping me.</i>

45:19.140 --> 45:22.735
So what about you?
You got low self-esteem?

45:22.810 --> 45:25.938
Or, uh, mild depression?

45:26.013 --> 45:31.007
<i>Or maybe a weird
psychosexual disorder?</i>

45:36.824 --> 45:39.190
My mom tried to kill me.

45:41.128 --> 45:45.428
She stabbed me in the bathroom
one day after school.

45:45.499 --> 45:47.899
Right.

45:53.808 --> 45:55.901
You're screwing with me.

45:57.745 --> 46:01.545
She's locked in that psych ward
outside of town.

46:02.950 --> 46:05.350
Clayton.

46:05.419 --> 46:08.582
Dad wanted to move here
to make a fresh new start.

46:11.058 --> 46:13.549
So here we are.

46:18.566 --> 46:20.591
You win.

46:20.801 --> 46:23.133
<i>¶¶</i>

46:24.305 --> 46:26.466
- Stop. What is it?
- 6-5-2-2.

46:26.540 --> 46:29.475
<i>¶¶</i>

46:29.543 --> 46:31.511
Oh, my gosh.
This is great.

46:33.647 --> 46:36.514
<i>You do have anger issues.</i>

46:36.584 --> 46:40.486
<i>¶¶</i>

46:43.424 --> 46:46.916
<i>¶¶</i>

47:02.076 --> 47:04.010
Hey!

47:04.078 --> 47:06.012
I wasn't sure you'd show up.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.446
- Leah talked me into it.
- You are so welcome.

47:08.516 --> 47:11.485
Do you seriously know,
like, all of these people?

47:11.552 --> 47:15.044
- No. Should I?
- Probably.

47:15.122 --> 47:18.114
- Do you want a drink?
- Um... sure.

47:19.260 --> 47:21.228
Okay, I can take a hint.
See ya.

47:21.295 --> 47:23.456
- Wait!
- Hey, follow me.

47:26.400 --> 47:29.335
<i>¶¶</i>

47:29.403 --> 47:31.337
So, what do you want to drink?

47:31.405 --> 47:33.339
I don't know.

47:33.407 --> 47:35.841
I'm gonna surprise you.

47:35.910 --> 47:39.368
<i>You're rich.
Rich rich.</i>

47:40.714 --> 47:43.205
<i>Well, / hope you don't
hold it against me.</i>

47:46.053 --> 47:47.987
So, where's Suzie?

47:48.055 --> 47:50.353
I don't know.
Why?

47:50.424 --> 47:52.585
Just wondering.

47:52.660 --> 47:57.529
- You know we broke up, right?
- No, I- I didn't know that.

47:57.598 --> 47:59.532
Yeah.
Things change.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.659
People change.

48:02.736 --> 48:04.761
You look different out of uniform.

48:04.838 --> 48:06.999
That's a compliment, right?

48:07.074 --> 48:10.737
Of course.
Here, try this.

48:10.811 --> 48:12.711
To things changing.

48:17.217 --> 48:20.243
Mmm.
You feel like dancing?

48:23.691 --> 48:27.183
<i>¶¶</i>

48:39.285 --> 48:41.378
This party's crazy.

48:41.453 --> 48:43.387
In a good way.

48:43.455 --> 48:45.389
It's all right, I guess, huh?

48:45.457 --> 48:47.391
Don't your parents mind?

48:47.459 --> 48:50.917
Let's not talk about my parents.

48:50.996 --> 48:54.193
- But I'm really glad you decided to show up.
- Me, too.

48:54.266 --> 48:56.200
<i>- Dude!
- What?</i>

48:56.268 --> 48:59.533
That hairy guy from Lincoln just stuffed
a package of frozen burritos down the toilet.

48:59.605 --> 49:02.369
- What?
- You got a plunger or something?

49:02.441 --> 49:04.534
<i>Yeah, um, / do.</i>

49:04.610 --> 49:07.408
Hold on. Will you stay right here
while I go and fix this, please?

49:07.479 --> 49:10.039
I'm sorry. I'll be right back,
I promise. Okay?

49:13.319 --> 49:15.810
<i>¶¶</i>

49:19.291 --> 49:21.691
What the hell are you doing here?

49:21.760 --> 49:23.557
Your ex-boyfriend invited me.

49:23.629 --> 49:26.598
My ex-boyfriend?

49:26.665 --> 49:31.398
<i>Am / supposed to be shocked?
Am / supposed to run away crying?</i>

49:31.470 --> 49:33.404
<i>Am / supposed to be scared?</i>

49:33.472 --> 49:36.236
Everyone knows you're
a mental case, Molly.

49:37.343 --> 49:38.901
Just like your mother.

49:41.213 --> 49:43.738
<i>Fight back, girl!</i>

49:43.816 --> 49:45.374
Go to hell.

49:47.853 --> 49:50.151
Stay away from my boyfriend!

49:50.222 --> 49:53.555
I don't like to be threatened!

49:56.128 --> 49:58.323
You bitch!

49:59.531 --> 50:02.659
Leave... me... alone!

50:06.839 --> 50:08.670
<i>Messed her up!</i>

50:13.479 --> 50:15.413
<i>There's no way.</i>

50:15.481 --> 50:18.575
<i>So he gets sent for, like,
three weeks and he cries-</i>

50:18.651 --> 50:21.142
- I wanna go home.
- What?

50:21.220 --> 50:22.949
I want to go home.

50:23.022 --> 50:26.514
Okay. Okay. Well,
I'm not ready to go yet.

50:26.592 --> 50:30.528
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't
even be here. I got you invited.

50:30.596 --> 50:33.793
Sorry. I think I'm too wasted
to drive you home.

50:33.866 --> 50:35.959
Ask your new boyfriend.

50:40.572 --> 50:43.166
Molly! Molly, wait.

50:43.242 --> 50:45.301
I didn't mean it.
L-

50:54.720 --> 50:56.517
<i>Shit!</i>

51:01.026 --> 51:03.221
- Hey.
- Dad?

51:03.295 --> 51:06.731
Where the hell are you? I've been trying
to call you. You have to leave your phone on.

51:06.799 --> 51:09.233
I'm sorry.
I need you to come pick me up.

51:09.301 --> 51:12.134
- Not sure- am-
- Molly?

51:12.204 --> 51:15.230
Dad? Dad?

51:15.307 --> 51:17.537
Are you there?

51:17.609 --> 51:19.839
Molly!

52:19.471 --> 52:21.405
Molly?

52:21.473 --> 52:26.103
I'm at a pay phone.
It's 145 F-Fairpoint Drive.

52:26.178 --> 52:30.706
It's, um, right across from
an old barbecue restaurant.

52:30.783 --> 52:33.115
Are you safe?

52:33.185 --> 52:36.552
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm safe.

52:36.622 --> 52:39.386
Okay. Go inside the restaurant
and wait for me right there.

52:39.458 --> 52:41.619
I'm leaving right now.
You understand?

52:41.693 --> 52:44.161
<i>Okay.</i>

52:51.870 --> 52:55.738
I know what you are, and I can't let you be
filled with the darkness! Do you understand?

52:55.808 --> 52:59.437
Molly! Molly!

53:01.814 --> 53:04.977
Molly!
Let me save you!

53:07.886 --> 53:10.116
Mom?

53:15.360 --> 53:19.194
Where are you?
Where are you?

53:19.264 --> 53:21.425
Where are you?

53:21.500 --> 53:24.196
- Where is she?
- Hey, are you all right?

53:24.269 --> 53:27.534
Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?

53:31.343 --> 53:34.278
<i>Go ahead
and make that an attempted code one.</i>

53:44.389 --> 53:46.323
Molly.

53:46.391 --> 53:48.518
- She was here.
- No.

53:48.594 --> 53:50.528
Yes.

53:50.596 --> 53:54.464
- I know what I saw!
- Sweetheart, I called Clayton. She's in her room.

53:54.533 --> 53:56.694
She's been in her room all night.

54:03.475 --> 54:05.466
I'm scared.

54:05.544 --> 54:08.172
Don't be scared.
I'm right here.

54:08.247 --> 54:10.545
That's not good enough.

54:11.550 --> 54:13.541
Everything is gonna be all right.

54:34.606 --> 54:36.597
<i>Suzie.</i>

54:40.245 --> 54:42.076
I'm really sorry.

54:43.715 --> 54:45.706
I know what you are.

54:45.784 --> 54:48.184
What?

54:51.290 --> 54:53.281
<i>What am /?</i>

54:54.626 --> 54:57.254
What am I?

55:05.370 --> 55:07.304
Molly, hey, are you okay?

55:07.372 --> 55:11.240
I've been so worried about you. I left
you messages. Why didn't you call me back?

55:11.310 --> 55:13.244
I don't know.

55:13.312 --> 55:16.247
What happened that night
at the party?

55:16.315 --> 55:18.442
I didn't mean to hurt her.

55:18.517 --> 55:22.214
Molly, I don't care about what happened to
Suzie. I care about what happened to you.

55:23.655 --> 55:25.589
I don't know what happened!

55:25.657 --> 55:29.218
- L-
- You can tell me. Just talk to me. It's okay.

55:32.497 --> 55:34.658
Please.

55:35.968 --> 55:37.902
Just leave me alone.

55:37.970 --> 55:40.962
- Everyone should just leave me alone.
- Molly!

55:42.541 --> 55:44.475
<i>/t felt real.</i>

55:44.543 --> 55:46.511
But you understand that it wasn't.

55:46.578 --> 55:49.308
What is happening to me?

55:49.381 --> 55:53.317
Fear is a very powerful emotion, Molly.
Plays tricks with your mind.

55:53.385 --> 55:57.515
It makes you see things and hear things
that aren't really there.

55:57.589 --> 56:01.320
Nothing is wrong with you.
You're perfectly normal.

56:01.393 --> 56:03.122
Nothing about me is normal!

56:04.563 --> 56:08.522
- Why did she try to kill me?
- Your mother is very ill.

56:08.600 --> 56:12.696
She's not in her right mind. She's not
thinking clearly. Do you understand that?

56:12.771 --> 56:15.934
We're gonna
work through this together.

56:18.577 --> 56:20.511
Okay.

56:20.579 --> 56:23.844
Here.
I want you to take this.

56:23.915 --> 56:27.112
I want you to call that number
any time you need to talk.

56:27.185 --> 56:29.813
I'm here for you.

56:29.888 --> 56:31.879
Okay.

56:36.628 --> 56:38.721
Molly.

56:38.797 --> 56:40.731
Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

56:40.799 --> 56:44.462
I should've taken you home
the other night.

56:44.536 --> 56:46.527
It doesn't matter.

56:48.540 --> 56:51.134
But it's your birthday tomorrow.

56:51.209 --> 56:53.677
I mean, let's-
let's do something.

57:01.987 --> 57:03.978
Molly!

57:04.056 --> 57:05.648
<i>Hi.</i>

57:05.724 --> 57:09.421
I need to get home.
I'm sorry.

57:09.494 --> 57:11.428
I know about the party.

57:11.496 --> 57:14.363
I know what happened.
Suzie Woods told me everything.

57:14.433 --> 57:16.560
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

57:16.635 --> 57:20.002
I'm not mad you ditched me.
Honest.

57:21.873 --> 57:24.706
You should come inside.

57:26.711 --> 57:28.406
I can't.

57:28.480 --> 57:30.414
Whatever you're going through,
we can help.

57:30.482 --> 57:34.976
If you're lost,
if you're afraid, we can help.

57:35.053 --> 57:39.581
If you accept Christ into your heart,
you'll be blessed with eternal salvation...

57:39.658 --> 57:41.853
<i>spiritual protection, grace.</i>

57:41.927 --> 57:43.918
Isn't that what you want?

57:45.263 --> 57:48.699
You're a good person, Molly.
Let me help.

58:14.226 --> 58:16.160
Hi, you've reached
Robert Hartley's cell phone.

58:16.228 --> 58:19.425
I'm unavailable to take your call right now,
but if you leave me a message...

58:19.498 --> 58:21.932
I'll call you as soon as I can.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.436
I'm home. You told me to call
when I got here, so I'm calling.

59:44.449 --> 59:46.815
Stupid lock.

59:46.885 --> 59:50.013
Get away from me!

59:50.088 --> 59:52.488
Molly, the nurse let me out.

59:52.557 --> 59:55.219
She let me out because she believes.

59:55.293 --> 59:57.056
What do you want from me?

59:57.128 --> 59:59.653
To save you.
That's all I want.

59:59.731 --> 01:00:02.666
You have no idea
what you're about to become.

01:00:02.734 --> 01:00:05.294
<i>Can't you feel it, Molly?</i>

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:07.361
<i>There is evil everywhere.</i>

01:00:07.439 --> 01:00:10.670
The darkness is coming for you, honey.
It's coming.

01:00:10.742 --> 01:00:12.835
What's happening to me?

01:00:12.911 --> 01:00:15.505
I'm so sorry.
We made a terrible mistake.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.241
What?

01:00:17.315 --> 01:00:22.218
You were never meant to live.
We were so weak. We were so selfish.

01:00:22.287 --> 01:00:25.222
You died the night you were born...

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:28.589
on the bathroom floor
of a restaurant.

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:32.562
<i>You came too early. / never made it
to the hospital. There was too much blood.</i>

01:00:34.332 --> 01:00:39.292
I'd lost babies before- miscarriages-
and I couldn't lose another one.

01:00:39.371 --> 01:00:41.236
<i>But then this woman
suddenly appeared.</i>

01:00:43.441 --> 01:00:47.070
I don't know where she came from,
but suddenly she was just standing there...

01:00:47.145 --> 01:00:49.409
and she offered us a deal.

01:00:49.481 --> 01:00:52.416
She promised to make you live.

01:00:52.484 --> 01:00:56.477
<i>Honey, they knew you were special.
That's why she came for you.</i>

01:00:56.554 --> 01:01:00.422
<i>She promised us 18 years together.</i>

01:01:00.492 --> 01:01:02.392
And then you would belong to them.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.395
- I don't believe you.
- There are others like you.

01:01:05.463 --> 01:01:08.489
- Dad would've said something!
- No, he refuses to believe the truth!

01:01:08.566 --> 01:01:12.434
He made the choice, but he doesn't
understand! But I know what we did!

01:01:12.504 --> 01:01:14.972
I know this has happened before.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.974
- You're crazy!
- No, I'm not crazy!

01:01:17.042 --> 01:01:19.977
- Yeah!
- If I don't stop you now, you'll do terrible things.

01:01:20.045 --> 01:01:24.505
I just wanna make things right
before it's too late, before you turn 18.

01:01:24.582 --> 01:01:28.348
Don't you understand what's happening to you?
Can't you feel it?

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.354
You're being torn from this world.

01:01:30.422 --> 01:01:33.016
Everything you do will be
in the service of them!

01:01:33.091 --> 01:01:36.151
- Your life will no longer be yours anymore!
- Shut up!

01:01:36.227 --> 01:01:38.752
- Don't you understand? I can save you!
- No!

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:41.799
May God take you
so you can be saved!

01:01:43.068 --> 01:01:45.832
- Molly!
- Help! Somebody help me!

01:01:45.904 --> 01:01:48.771
<i>Molly!</i>

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.604
No! I can't let you live!

01:01:51.676 --> 01:01:54.042
I can't let the darkness take you!

01:01:54.112 --> 01:01:56.672
They're coming for you!

01:01:56.748 --> 01:02:00.309
No! I love you!
Honey! No!

01:02:00.385 --> 01:02:02.945
No!

01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:30.269
She came back.

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:33.973
She told me everything!

01:03:35.513 --> 01:03:38.038
What happened
the night I was born!

01:03:38.116 --> 01:03:40.141
What'll happen to me
on my 18th birthday!

01:03:40.218 --> 01:03:43.153
Molly, for God's sake, we didn't do anything!
She's delusional!

01:03:43.221 --> 01:03:46.622
She knew something was going to happen
to me and she tried to help me!

01:03:46.691 --> 01:03:48.625
She wanted to stop it!

01:03:48.693 --> 01:03:51.321
No!
Nothing is gonna happen to you!

01:03:51.396 --> 01:03:55.594
That wasn't real! That was some religious
nutcase screwing with your mother's head!

01:03:55.667 --> 01:03:59.467
You have to do something!
Tomorrow's my fucking birthday!

01:03:59.537 --> 01:04:02.665
- You can't let them take me!
- No one is gonna take you!

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:05.072
<i>Now, this is exactly
how it started with your mother...</i>

01:04:05.143 --> 01:04:09.443
<i>with the religious delusions and the
paranoia and the losing touch with reality.</i>

01:04:09.514 --> 01:04:11.846
<i>She's dead because of me!</i>

01:04:11.916 --> 01:04:14.476
I won't let that happen again.
I won't lose you, too.

01:04:14.552 --> 01:04:16.645
Let go!

01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:20.784
I'm gonna get you some help.
A good doctor.

01:04:20.859 --> 01:04:24.295
<i>- Someone who can help you see the truth.
- I know the truth!</i>

01:04:24.362 --> 01:04:26.956
- I have to find a way to stop it!
- Then just let me help you.

01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:30.797
- Let me take you someplace quiet and safe.
- I won't let you lock me up!

01:04:39.577 --> 01:04:48.977
<i>¶ Through the blood ofJesus ¶</i>

01:04:49.053 --> 01:04:53.615
<i>¶ Through the blood ofJesus ¶¶</i>

01:04:53.691 --> 01:04:57.078
<i>- ¶¶
- What are you doing here?</i>

01:04:57.212 --> 01:05:00.477
I need your help.
I don't know where else to go.

01:05:04.219 --> 01:05:07.279
Of course I'll help.
But you have to tell me what's wrong.

01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:10.758
Is it too late for me?

01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:13.760
Is it too late for me to be saved?

01:05:13.828 --> 01:05:16.023
It's never too late.

01:05:16.097 --> 01:05:19.328
Even if someone chose
a terrible path for me?

01:05:19.401 --> 01:05:21.335
You're responsible
for your own salvation.

01:05:21.403 --> 01:05:23.803
- God lets you make that choice for yourself.
- You're sure?

01:05:23.872 --> 01:05:26.306
Of course.

01:05:26.374 --> 01:05:28.308
I choose it then.

01:05:28.376 --> 01:05:30.435
I choose salvation.

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.305
I'm really glad you came to me, Molly.

01:05:34.382 --> 01:05:36.316
You won't regret this journey.
I promise.

01:05:36.384 --> 01:05:38.443
No!
I can't take a journey!

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.318
I need you to help me now.
I'm running out of time.

01:05:41.389 --> 01:05:43.653
Time for what?

01:05:43.725 --> 01:05:45.454
I need protection...

01:05:45.527 --> 01:05:47.461
before it's too late.

01:05:48.563 --> 01:05:51.157
Please help me.

01:05:53.868 --> 01:05:55.859
Come with me.

01:06:04.345 --> 01:06:06.313
This way.

01:06:36.244 --> 01:06:38.235
Put this on.

01:06:41.783 --> 01:06:43.876
This will work, right?

01:06:43.952 --> 01:06:46.853
If you acceptJesus Christ into your heart,
you will be purified.

01:06:46.921 --> 01:06:49.913
You'll be born of water and the Spirit,
and you will be saved.

01:06:54.028 --> 01:06:56.087
That's what you want, isn't it?

01:06:56.164 --> 01:06:58.155
Yes.

01:06:59.467 --> 01:07:01.401
Come with me.

01:07:18.553 --> 01:07:21.954
Do you believe and trust in God, the
Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth...

01:07:22.023 --> 01:07:24.958
who gave us his only son
to die for us?

01:07:25.026 --> 01:07:28.291
Do you believe in his son, Jesus Christ,
who was crucified for our sins...

01:07:28.363 --> 01:07:31.298
rose from the dead,
and is the only way to salvation?

01:07:31.366 --> 01:07:33.800
Do you believe and trust
in the Holy Spirit...

01:07:33.868 --> 01:07:37.929
who enables us to receive God's word,
repent, and believe the Gospels?

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.274
Say if you believe.

01:07:41.342 --> 01:07:43.333
L-

01:07:47.582 --> 01:07:49.516
Yes.

01:07:49.584 --> 01:07:53.782
Do you wish to be baptized
to seal this faith?

01:07:53.855 --> 01:07:55.846
Yes.

01:07:55.924 --> 01:07:57.687
Close your eyes.

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:17.501
Is it done?

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.615
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:08:21.683 --> 01:08:24.777
Do you know
where my grandmother's a nurse?

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.814
Clayton.

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:32.053
I know about your mother, Molly,
and what she believes.

01:08:33.627 --> 01:08:36.721
Jesus, forgive me for my sins.

01:08:38.066 --> 01:08:40.000
This will save your soul!

01:08:40.068 --> 01:08:44.801
- You promised to help me!
- I am! I'm saving you! Now you'll be with God!

01:08:45.907 --> 01:08:48.307
Stay down!
I'm sending you to heaven!

01:08:48.943 --> 01:08:50.808
I know what you are!

01:08:50.879 --> 01:08:54.872
I can't let you live!
Don't you see? This is the only way!

01:09:09.997 --> 01:09:12.228
<i>Oh.</i>

01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:17.194
I'm sorry.

01:09:38.426 --> 01:09:41.589
Molly? My God!
Are you okay?

01:09:41.662 --> 01:09:44.256
What happened?
Come here.

01:09:44.332 --> 01:09:47.893
Get in the car. It's gonna be okay.

01:09:53.174 --> 01:09:55.404
Are you gonna
tell me what happened?

01:09:56.778 --> 01:10:00.646
There are a lot of things
that you don't know about me.

01:10:00.715 --> 01:10:03.548
Terrible things.

01:10:03.618 --> 01:10:06.485
Well, I could probably say
the exact same thing, Molly.

01:10:06.554 --> 01:10:08.488
No!

01:10:08.556 --> 01:10:10.421
You don't understand!

01:10:10.491 --> 01:10:14.325
Okay, so explain it to me.
Please, Molly. Just tell me what happened.

01:10:33.848 --> 01:10:38.285
Hey, Mr. Hartley.
Is, um- Is Molly here?

01:10:38.353 --> 01:10:40.014
No. No.

01:10:40.088 --> 01:10:42.022
I just-

01:10:42.090 --> 01:10:45.355
- I got her a birthday present, so-
- Yeah, I'll take it.

01:10:45.426 --> 01:10:47.417
Okay.

01:10:49.197 --> 01:10:51.131
Is Molly okay?

01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:53.633
Yeah.
I'm sure she's fine.

01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:59.196
Um... do you have any idea
where she might be?

01:11:09.584 --> 01:11:12.348
Say something.

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:16.151
I just think you're tired.
Just go inside and get some sleep.

01:11:16.224 --> 01:11:18.158
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

01:11:18.226 --> 01:11:20.490
Well, what am I supposed to say, Molly?

01:11:20.561 --> 01:11:23.894
Do you really expect me to believe
that your soul belongs to the devil?

01:11:23.965 --> 01:11:28.026
I mean, don't you realize
how insane that sounds?

01:11:31.672 --> 01:11:34.607
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say it like that.

01:11:34.675 --> 01:11:37.200
No. You're right.

01:11:37.278 --> 01:11:39.212
Maybe I am just like my mother.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.977
Maybe- Maybe I am just I-
losing my mind.

01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:46.145
No!
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.155
I don't know what to do.

01:11:49.223 --> 01:11:53.523
We just need to get the hell outta here, away
from your dad, away from this whole damn town.

01:11:53.594 --> 01:11:55.528
And go where?

01:11:55.596 --> 01:12:00.260
My dad keeps a lot of money in the safe,
enough to go practically anywhere.

01:12:00.334 --> 01:12:02.268
Just you and me.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.631
You don't have to do this.

01:12:15.116 --> 01:12:17.414
I'll be right back.
Okay?

01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:57.624
This is Amelia Emerson.

01:12:57.692 --> 01:13:01.321
Please leave me a detailed message and I'll
return the call as soon as possible. Thank you.

01:13:01.395 --> 01:13:05.263
Dr. Emerson, it's Molly.

01:13:08.236 --> 01:13:12.434
Something's happened and I'm in trouble,
and I don't know what to do.

01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:16.843
I'm atJoseph Young's...

01:13:16.911 --> 01:13:18.970
and I'm really scared.

01:13:22.016 --> 01:13:23.950
If you could call me back-

01:13:24.018 --> 01:13:25.952
<i>Molly!</i>

01:13:51.913 --> 01:13:53.904
Joseph?

01:14:05.193 --> 01:14:07.184
Joseph?

01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:17.861
Joseph?

01:14:28.583 --> 01:14:30.574
Joseph?

01:14:38.492 --> 01:14:40.483
Joseph?

01:15:29.877 --> 01:15:31.868
What are you doing?

01:15:33.047 --> 01:15:35.038
Are you surprised?

01:15:35.116 --> 01:15:37.050
<i>/t's your birthday, right?</i>

01:15:37.118 --> 01:15:38.949
Tomorrow.

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.954
Well, it's almost tomorrow.

01:15:41.022 --> 01:15:43.889
So, happy birthday a few minutes early.

01:15:45.993 --> 01:15:48.621
Come on.
Don't you wanna blow out the candle?

01:15:50.731 --> 01:15:52.756
I wanna get out of here.

01:15:52.833 --> 01:15:54.824
But what about our party?

01:15:54.902 --> 01:15:58.770
Okay, you're scaring me.
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:16:01.008 --> 01:16:02.976
<i>Joseph, let's go.</i>

01:16:03.044 --> 01:16:04.978
Let's go!

01:16:07.181 --> 01:16:08.443
Fine.

01:16:10.685 --> 01:16:13.483
<i>Dr. Emerson,
you got my message.</i>

01:16:13.554 --> 01:16:17.149
- Message?
- I called you. I-I left you a message.

01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:19.454
No. No message.

01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:26.832
Then what are you doing here?

01:16:26.901 --> 01:16:29.267
Well, it's your birthday, Molly.
Of course I'm here.

01:16:29.337 --> 01:16:33.171
<i>Just a few more minutes now. How does it feel?</i>

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.208
How does what feel?

01:16:35.276 --> 01:16:37.210
Your new life.

01:16:38.479 --> 01:16:42.279
<i>We're all here for you, Molly.
We've watched you grow.</i>

01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:46.286
<i>- We've chosen you.
- No.</i>

01:16:46.354 --> 01:16:48.345
No?

01:16:50.358 --> 01:16:52.349
You knew all along?

01:16:54.729 --> 01:16:56.287
You lied to me?

01:16:56.364 --> 01:16:58.457
You promised to help me!

01:16:58.532 --> 01:17:01.330
<i>He is helping you.
We're all helping you.</i>

01:17:01.402 --> 01:17:03.029
You're the one, Molly.

01:17:04.305 --> 01:17:07.172
Don't you know how lucky you are?

01:17:07.241 --> 01:17:10.369
<i>- Lucky?
- You'll have power like no one before you.</i>

01:17:10.444 --> 01:17:12.878
I didn't choose this!

01:17:12.947 --> 01:17:15.472
Your mother and father
made that choice for you.

01:17:15.549 --> 01:17:19.041
They did it to save my life.
That is not a choice.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.054
Of course it is.

01:17:21.122 --> 01:17:24.216
But human weakness has its consequences.
It always has.

01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:27.419
<i>D- D-Daddy!</i>

01:17:27.495 --> 01:17:29.588
I'm so sorry, Molly!

01:17:29.663 --> 01:17:32.291
<i>/ didn't- / didn't-</i>

01:17:32.366 --> 01:17:35.767
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

01:17:35.836 --> 01:17:38.532
I'm here to make you an offer.

01:17:40.941 --> 01:17:43.205
I didn't believe.

01:17:43.277 --> 01:17:45.404
We gave you exactly what you wanted.

01:17:45.479 --> 01:17:48.539
Then take me!
It was my mistake! Take me!

01:17:48.749 --> 01:17:52.276
God, forgive me.
L- I have sinned.

01:17:52.353 --> 01:17:55.618
<i>- / renounce Satan and all-
- What can God offer you?</i>

01:17:55.689 --> 01:17:59.284
We've given you everything-
your very life.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.726
And now you have great power
ahead of you.

01:18:01.796 --> 01:18:05.095
- I don't want it!
- You will.

01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:08.226
God always gives us a choice.

01:18:08.302 --> 01:18:12.363
Is that what you think?
God gives you a choice?

01:18:16.572 --> 01:18:20.235
Your parents determined your fate.
They turned their back on God.

01:18:20.309 --> 01:18:22.106
They made a pact.

01:18:22.177 --> 01:18:24.111
Maybe if you kill your father...

01:18:24.179 --> 01:18:26.739
the pact will be dissolved.

01:18:26.815 --> 01:18:29.181
What?

01:18:29.251 --> 01:18:32.914
<i>Of course / can't offer you that choice,
but... maybe God can.</i>

01:18:33.589 --> 01:18:35.181
No. No!

01:18:35.257 --> 01:18:38.852
Go ahead. Do it.
Just do it.

01:18:38.928 --> 01:18:40.919
Go on.

01:18:46.869 --> 01:18:48.894
Sweetie, I love you.

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:53.875
- It's- It's the only way.
- Just do it.

01:18:53.943 --> 01:18:55.808
<i>Please do it.</i>

01:18:57.346 --> 01:18:59.371
I'm sorry.

01:19:03.452 --> 01:19:06.649
<i>/ love you.</i>

01:19:06.722 --> 01:19:08.451
I've always loved you.

01:19:09.959 --> 01:19:11.483
No! No!

01:19:12.661 --> 01:19:14.458
No, no, no, no!

01:19:25.741 --> 01:19:28.073
You've always belonged to us.

01:19:32.815 --> 01:19:34.680
Welcome.

01:19:35.918 --> 01:19:37.909
<i>We've been waiting.</i>

01:19:43.959 --> 01:19:47.156
<i>The patient confessed to the murder
and was brought in about a week ago.</i>

01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:49.663
<i>There were several
attempted suicides...</i>

01:19:49.732 --> 01:19:54.066
<i>as well as paranoid
and religious delusions.</i>

01:19:54.136 --> 01:19:57.537
I know this is a lot to take in.

01:19:57.606 --> 01:20:00.541
We've had him
under observation for a week.

01:20:00.609 --> 01:20:03.703
<i>So far there's been no change.</i>

01:20:03.779 --> 01:20:07.374
- Some interaction with you might draw him out of his shell.
- No.

01:20:07.449 --> 01:20:09.383
I'm sorry?

01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:11.612
I can't.
I need to move on.

01:20:11.687 --> 01:20:14.178
Don't give up on him.
He's your father.

01:20:14.256 --> 01:20:15.951
Not anymore.

01:20:16.025 --> 01:20:19.791
Miss Hartley, is there
something you wanna tell me?

01:20:19.862 --> 01:20:22.296
It's just the way
things were meant to be.

01:20:22.364 --> 01:20:25.731
I know you'll take
really good care of him.

01:20:27.636 --> 01:20:29.570
<i>On a personal note...</i>

01:20:29.638 --> 01:20:33.074
<i>/ would like to thank Huntington Prep
for not only welcoming me into their school...</i>

01:20:33.142 --> 01:20:35.838
but for endowing me with
the honor of valedictorian.

01:20:35.911 --> 01:20:40.678
<i>/n closing, / truly believe that
each one of us has a special destiny...</i>

01:20:40.749 --> 01:20:43.775
<i>and we owe it to the world
to fulfill that destiny.</i>

01:20:43.852 --> 01:20:48.721
We are the generation who will change
the world like no one has changed it before us.

01:20:48.791 --> 01:20:50.725
You can count on it.

01:20:50.793 --> 01:20:52.727
Good luck, everyone!

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:58.322
<i>¶¶</i>

01:21:07.476 --> 01:21:10.206
Shall we?

01:21:10.279 --> 01:21:12.611
<i>- Congratulations, Molly.
- Thank you.</i>

01:21:12.681 --> 01:21:14.774
See you soon.

01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:18.251
