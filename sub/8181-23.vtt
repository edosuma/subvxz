WEBVTT

00:04.670 --> 00:05.786
DOUG, JUST ADMIT IT.

00:05.854 --> 00:07.989
CARRIE, I WAS NOT
CRYING, OKAY?

00:08.055 --> 00:11.058
COME ON, IT WAS A SAD
MOVIE, IT'S OKAY TO CRY.

00:11.127 --> 00:13.861
FOR THE LAST TIME, I GOT
NACHO SAUCE IN MY EYE

00:13.929 --> 00:17.064
AND YEAH, THERE WERE TEARS,
BUT THEY WERE SNACK-RELATED.

00:17.133 --> 00:20.901
OKAY, 'CAUSE I THOUGHT I SAW
A DIFFERENT SIDE OF YOU

00:20.969 --> 00:23.538
AND IT, UH, KIND
OF TURNED ME ON.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.873
OH, ME CRYING
TURNS YOU ON.

00:25.941 --> 00:27.658
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:27.726 --> 00:29.460
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING

00:29.528 --> 00:31.729
OF DOING THE, UH,
BIRTHDAY THING FOR YOU.

00:31.797 --> 00:34.148
OH, YEAH, OKAY,
THE BIRTHDAY THING.

00:34.216 --> 00:35.383
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:35.451 --> 00:36.918
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER NOW, DOES IT?

00:36.985 --> 00:40.254
BECAUSE YOU MADE IT CLEAR
THAT YOU WERE NOT CRYING.

00:40.323 --> 00:43.692
WAIT, CARRIE, WAIT.

00:43.759 --> 00:45.560
I WAS CRYING.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.711
OH, SHUT UP.

00:46.779 --> 00:48.580
NO, I WAS,
I MEAN...

00:48.647 --> 00:52.650
WHEN THE BABY PENGUIN, YOU
KNOW, DIED, AFTER THE PARENTS

00:52.718 --> 00:55.653
TRIED TO SAVE IT
THROUGH THE LONG WINTER...

00:55.721 --> 00:57.289
I DON'T KNOW,
IT JUST GOT TO ME.

00:57.356 --> 00:58.790
IT DID.

00:58.857 --> 01:03.194
YOU SEE, I KNEW
YOU WERE CRYING.

01:03.262 --> 01:05.096
HOW ABOUT THE
BIRTHDAY THING?

01:05.164 --> 01:06.898
YEAH, RIGHT.

FREAKS CAN COOK.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.111
WE ACTUALLY DON'T

01:53.179 --> 01:54.645
YOU JUST COME.

01:56.448 --> 01:59.551
SOMETIMES WHEN
WE'RE NOT THERE.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.720
WE FOUND STUFF.

THIS IS MAY 15TH,
THE 2 YEAR ANNIVERSARY

02:14.800 --> 02:17.969
OF WHEN WE MOVED
IN TOGETHER.

02:18.037 --> 02:21.706
SOMEBODY'S GETTIN'
LUCKY TONIGHT.

02:21.773 --> 02:23.875
ACTUALLY, I AM.

02:23.942 --> 02:26.494
I WAS KIDDING.

02:26.561 --> 02:30.732
NO, WE MADE A DEAL,
I GET THE BIG BEDROOM.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.483
REMEMBER?

02:34.986 --> 02:37.188
IF AFTER TWO YEARS
WE'RE TOO POOR TO MOVE

02:37.256 --> 02:39.591
AND STILL HAVE
NO GIRLFRIENDS,

02:39.658 --> 02:41.192
THE BIG BEDROOM
REVERTS TO SPENCE.

02:41.260 --> 02:45.530
WELL, WE'RE STILL POOR
AND WE'RE STILL SINGLE.

02:45.598 --> 02:46.881
YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:46.949 --> 02:48.182
I'M NOT MOVING INTO
THAT MOP CLOSET.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.583
NO, I HAVE IT
IN WRITING.

02:49.652 --> 02:52.620
OH YEAH, OH, OKAY,
WELL, NOW YOU DON'T.

02:52.688 --> 02:54.406
THAT NAPKIN IS BINDING.

02:54.473 --> 02:56.124
YEAH, WELL THEN
DON'T EAT IT.

02:56.192 --> 02:58.026
HEY, YOU ARE MOVING
YOUR STUFF OUT OF MY ROOM.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.127
NO, I'M NOT.

02:59.195 --> 03:00.362
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS IS SO TYPICAL.

03:00.429 --> 03:03.731
YOU NEVER GIVE BACK MONEY
WHEN I LOAN IT TO YOU.

03:03.799 --> 03:04.866
YOU NEVER CLEAN UP AFTER
YOURSELF AND NOW THIS?

03:04.933 --> 03:05.867
I'M TIRED OF IT.

03:05.934 --> 03:07.068
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TIRED OF?

03:07.136 --> 03:09.871
YOUR BIG FAT HEAD.

03:09.938 --> 03:11.806
YEAH, WELL, I'M TIRED
OF YOUR HEAD.

03:11.874 --> 03:13.191
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.992
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO YOU.

03:19.048 --> 03:22.783
THAT ICE CREAM CAKE WE
BROUGHT NEEDS TO SIT OUT.

03:30.876 --> 03:32.209
OH MY GOD.

03:32.277 --> 03:33.978
DAD, ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:34.046 --> 03:36.114
HE'S OKAY, HE JUST
INHALED A LITTLE SMOKE.

03:36.181 --> 03:37.398
SMOKE FROM WHAT?

03:37.465 --> 03:38.766
THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE
IN THE BASEMENT.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.235
BUT THANK GOD
NOBODY GOT HURT.

03:40.302 --> 03:43.238
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I'D
SAY IT'S NOT A GREAT IDEA

03:43.305 --> 03:45.740
TO HAVE HIM MAKING BACON NEXT
TO AN OPEN CAN OF GASOLINE.

03:47.509 --> 03:49.443
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO COOK DOWN THERE.

03:49.511 --> 03:50.611
YOU BANNED ME
FROM THE KITCHEN!

03:50.679 --> 03:52.497
OKAY, I SWEAR,
I'M GONNA KILL...

03:52.564 --> 03:53.698
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY, YOU
MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AWAY

03:53.766 --> 03:55.000
BECAUSE I AM GOING
TO KILL HIM!

03:55.067 --> 03:56.017
HONEY.

03:56.168 --> 03:57.502
NO, I'M SICK OF IT,
CARRIE, I'M SICK OF HIM.

03:57.569 --> 03:59.770
DOUG, TAKE IT EASY,
HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

03:59.838 --> 04:00.989
OKAY, LOU, PLEASE
STAY OUT OF THIS.

04:01.057 --> 04:04.358
YOU WOULD NOT WANT
TO SEE ME WHEN I'M ANGRY.

04:10.298 --> 04:12.166
SO MY DAD'S GONNA
SLEEP IN THE OFFICE.

04:12.234 --> 04:13.367
THE BASEMENT IS
KIND OF FLOODED.

04:13.435 --> 04:15.286
YEAH, I KNOW, I WAS
THINKING WE COULD TURN

04:15.354 --> 04:17.321
IT INTO
A WET-AND-WILD.

04:18.874 --> 04:20.440
DOUG, LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE A LITTLE UPSET.

04:20.509 --> 04:22.142
A LITTLE UPSET, CARRIE, WE
COULD HAVE LOST EVERYTHING

04:22.210 --> 04:23.143
DOWN THERE, EVERYTHING!

04:23.211 --> 04:24.245
DOUG, LISTEN TO ME.

04:24.312 --> 04:26.197
NO, OKAY, MY BASEBALL
CARD COLLECTION,

04:26.264 --> 04:28.999
MY CD'S,
MY AB ROLLER.

04:30.936 --> 04:32.870
DOUG, JUST SHUT UP AND LISTEN
TO ME ONE SECOND, OKAY?

04:32.938 --> 04:34.505
WHAT?

04:34.573 --> 04:36.724
LOOK, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS A LOT AND

04:36.792 --> 04:39.093
I THINK IT'S TIME TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT MY DAD.

04:40.362 --> 04:43.831
<i>YOU WANT TO DO THE PILLOW
THING WE SAW ON LAW AND ORDER?</i>

04:45.017 --> 04:47.518
NO.

04:47.586 --> 04:49.187
I'M THINKING THAT
MAYBE WE SHOULD...

04:49.255 --> 04:51.856
FIND SOMEPLACE ELSE
FOR HIM TO LIVE.

04:51.923 --> 04:53.641
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

04:53.708 --> 04:56.043
FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS, EVERY
TIME HE DOES SOMETHING STUPID

04:56.111 --> 04:57.611
LIKE STEALS MONEY
OUT OF YOUR WALLET

04:57.679 --> 04:59.914
OR THROWS THE REMOTE
CONTROL ACROSS THE ROOM

04:59.982 --> 05:02.984
BECAUSE HE SAID MATT LAUER
STOLE HIS HAIRCUT,

05:03.051 --> 05:05.653
I'VE ALWAYS DEFENDED HIM,
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO YOU.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.788
IT'S NOT FAIR TO US.

05:06.855 --> 05:08.156
IT ISN'T FAIR TO US.

05:08.223 --> 05:10.158
SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

05:10.225 --> 05:12.459
WELL, I THINK TOMORROW
MAYBE WE SHOULD START

05:12.527 --> 05:14.996
LOOKING AT SOME
RETIREMENT HOMES FOR HIM.

05:15.063 --> 05:17.565
OR, HOW ABOUT
RIGHT NOW.

05:17.632 --> 05:19.400
NOW LOOK, WE GOT ONE
OVER HERE IN RED MEADOWS.

05:19.435 --> 05:21.235
YOU KNOW WHAT, NO
BELLS AND WHISTLES

05:21.303 --> 05:22.236
BUT IT REALLY
GETS THE JOB DONE.

05:22.304 --> 05:23.637
COME, SIT, SIT, SIT.

05:25.324 --> 05:26.407
NOW, THIS ONE HERE
IS MY FAVORITE,

05:26.475 --> 05:28.643
NOT TO FAR AWAY, IT'S PRETTY
MUCH IN OUR PRICE RANGE

05:28.710 --> 05:29.778
AND I'M TELLIN' YOU,
HE'S GONNA LIKE IT.

05:29.845 --> 05:32.113
OH MY GOD, MY
HANDS ARE SHAKING.

05:36.618 --> 05:40.188
DOUG, I DON'T KNOW, THE ROOMS
LOOK SO SMALL AND DEPRESSING.

05:40.256 --> 05:43.324
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'LL
NEVER SEE IT AGAIN.

05:43.392 --> 05:44.209
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO GO EXPENSIVE

05:44.276 --> 05:46.578
BUT IF WE GOTTA DO IT,
THAT'S WHAT WE GOTTA DO.

05:46.645 --> 05:48.045
HERE WE GO,
NOT A PROBLEM.

05:48.113 --> 05:50.014
HEY, LOOK HOW NICE THIS ONE
IS HERE, HUH, LOOK AT THEM.

05:50.082 --> 05:51.782
LOOK AT THEM IN THE POOL,
THEY GOTTA POOL, LOOK AT

05:51.850 --> 05:55.853
THE OLD PEOPLE,
THEY'RE AQUA-DANCING.

06:12.988 --> 06:15.239
HEY, MAN.

06:15.307 --> 06:17.275
ALL RIGHT, VERY FUNNY,
WHERE'S ALL MY STUFF?

06:17.342 --> 06:20.428
UH, I MOVED IT
INTO YOUR ROOM.

06:20.496 --> 06:22.680
THIS IS MY ROOM.

06:22.748 --> 06:24.365
I DON'T THINK SO, UNLESS,
UH, THIS IS YOUR

06:24.432 --> 06:29.436
<i>WARRIORS OF GRUN POSTER,
STARRING ONE TONY DANZA.</i>

06:30.756 --> 06:32.390
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU
THINK, I'M AN IDIOT?

06:32.458 --> 06:34.225
I'LL JUST MOVE
EVERYTHING BACK.

06:34.293 --> 06:36.427
LET ME GET OUT
OF YOUR WAY.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.542
YOU BOLTED
EVERYTHING DOWN.

06:51.610 --> 06:54.261
YEAH, AND ONE OF MY THINGS
HAS AN ELECTRIC CURRENT

06:54.329 --> 06:57.999
RUNNING THROUGH IT, I'LL LET
YOU FIND THAT FOR YOURSELF.

07:02.554 --> 07:04.955
FLAT SCREEN WILL
GO RIGHT THERE, RIGHT?

07:05.023 --> 07:07.258
AIR HOCKEY TABLE OVER HERE
WITH, LIKE, A HOT DOG CART.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.759
AND HOW ABOUT THIS,
I'M JUST THINKIN',

07:08.827 --> 07:12.980
ONE OF THOSE CHAIRS THAT TAKES
ME UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS, HUH?

07:13.048 --> 07:16.316
FUN NOW,
NECESSARY LATER.

07:16.384 --> 07:18.752
SO DOES ARTHUR KNOW
HE'S GETTING THE BOOT YET?

07:18.820 --> 07:21.572
YEAH, WE BROKE IT TO HIM
LAST NIGHT AT SIZZLER.

07:21.640 --> 07:22.756
HOW'D IT GO?

07:22.824 --> 07:23.908
NOT AS WELL
AS WE THOUGHT.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.310
HE HELD HIS BREATH A COUPLE
MINUTES AND HE BIT A WAITER.

07:26.378 --> 07:30.732
OKAY, WELL ANYWAY, IS
ANYTHING VALUABLE IN HERE?

07:30.799 --> 07:32.567
IT'S ALL SOAKED.

07:32.635 --> 07:34.001
I DON'T KNOW, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST OPEN IT UP.

07:34.069 --> 07:35.836
MAN.

07:43.345 --> 07:45.179
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS STUFF?

07:45.247 --> 07:47.048
IT'S PLAYBILLS.

07:47.116 --> 07:48.449
FIDDLER ON THE ROOF?

07:48.517 --> 07:50.117
THE ICEMAN COMETH?

07:50.185 --> 07:52.703
IS THAT ARTHUR?

07:52.771 --> 07:53.904
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE HIM.

07:53.972 --> 07:56.040
HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS AN ACTOR.

07:56.107 --> 07:57.508
NEITHER DID I.

07:57.576 --> 08:00.995
WELL, WE HAD A BOMB SCARE
IN THE BRONX YESTERDAY.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.964
<i>BUT IT TURNED OUT
TO BE A CANTALOUPE.</i>

08:04.633 --> 08:09.637
REQUESTING PERMISSION
TO HAVE A GLASS OF WATER.

08:09.705 --> 08:12.339
ARTHUR, YOU DON'T NEED TO ASK
PERMISSION ABOUT EVERYTHING.

08:12.407 --> 08:14.058
OF COURSE I DO, I'M
A GUEST IN YOUR HOUSE.

08:14.126 --> 08:17.128
AT LEAST UNTIL YOU THROW
ME OUT INTO THE STREET.

08:18.680 --> 08:19.980
HEY, WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

08:20.048 --> 08:21.381
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT?

08:21.449 --> 08:22.349
DOWN IN THE BASEMENT.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.152
YES, LOCKED UP
IN MY TRUNK.

08:25.220 --> 08:27.354
HOW DARE YOU GO THROUGH
MY PRIVATE THINGS!

08:27.422 --> 08:29.023
YOU GO THROUGH MY
STUFF ALL THE TIME.

08:29.090 --> 08:30.691
THAT IS A LIE!

08:30.758 --> 08:32.926
ARTHUR, YESTERDAY I CAUGHT
YOU EATING MY CHAP STICK.

08:36.931 --> 08:38.698
NOW WHAT IS THIS?

08:38.765 --> 08:41.934
LOOK, YOU WERE IN TV
SHOWS AND IN BROADWAY PLAYS.

08:42.003 --> 08:44.438
YOU GOT PAY STUBS HERE FOR,
LIKE, THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

08:44.506 --> 08:46.273
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:46.341 --> 08:48.643
IT WAS ALWAYS MY
DREAM TO BE AN ACTOR.

08:48.711 --> 08:50.277
I WAS A NATURAL.

08:50.346 --> 08:51.579
IN FACT, I WAS
OFTEN COMPARED

08:51.647 --> 08:55.082
TO A YOUNGER, SHORTER
FRED MCMURRAY.

08:57.385 --> 08:59.120
WHAT HAPPENED, WHY IS
THERE A STUBBY FRED MCMURRAY

08:59.187 --> 09:00.821
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

09:00.889 --> 09:06.443
THE SIXTIES HAPPENED,
IT WAS A TIME OF FREE LOVE.

09:06.511 --> 09:11.115
ONE EVENING, I MET
A GORGEOUS YOUNG DANCER.

09:11.182 --> 09:12.883
WE HAD A WILD
NIGHT, DOUGLAS.

09:12.951 --> 09:16.954
IN THE BED, IN THE SHOWER,
WE DESTROYED A BEANBAG CHAIR.

09:19.491 --> 09:22.660
BACK TO THE ACTING.

09:22.727 --> 09:27.632
ANYWAY, NINE
MONTHS LATER...

09:27.699 --> 09:31.002
CARRIE WAS BORN.

09:31.069 --> 09:32.937
I NEVER ACTED AGAIN.

09:33.005 --> 09:34.238
WHY NOT?

09:34.306 --> 09:36.641
BECAUSE IN THE PERFORMING ARTS
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE

09:36.708 --> 09:39.577
WORKING, WHERE
YOU'RE WORKING.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.345
THAT'S NO WAY
TO RAISE A CHILD.

09:41.413 --> 09:42.580
SO YOU JUST...

09:42.648 --> 09:45.700
YOU STOPPED, I MEAN YOU
JUST GAVE UP YOUR DREAM?

09:45.767 --> 09:47.067
ALL FOR CARRIE?

09:47.135 --> 09:52.423
YES, I DECIDED TO BECOME
A 9-TO-5 CHARLIE

09:52.491 --> 09:55.426
AND GIVE HER THE STABLE
LIFE SHE DESERVED.

09:55.494 --> 09:58.845
BUT YOU'VE NEVER HELD
A JOB FOR MORE THAN A MONTH.

10:00.482 --> 10:03.284
I DIDN'T SAY
IT WORKED OUT.

10:04.486 --> 10:05.620
I'M HOME.

10:05.687 --> 10:06.788
DOES SHE KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

10:06.855 --> 10:09.624
NO, AND PROMISE ME
SHE NEVER WILL.

10:23.105 --> 10:24.739
HEY, BUDDY.

10:24.806 --> 10:26.506
YEAH, THIS
IS REAL MATURE.

10:26.574 --> 10:28.875
YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO BOLTED MY POTTERY WHEEL

10:28.943 --> 10:29.943
TO THE FLOOR.

10:30.011 --> 10:31.863
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M NOT LEAVING.

10:31.930 --> 10:35.032
IN FACT...

10:35.100 --> 10:38.369
I'M NEVER LEAVING.

10:38.436 --> 10:40.371
WELL, NEITHER
AM I, AND F.Y.I.,

10:40.438 --> 10:44.341
I HAVE 9 SICK DAYS AND
I'M NOT AFRAID TO USE 'EM.

10:44.409 --> 10:46.961
I'LL QUIT MY JOB.

10:47.029 --> 10:50.264
I'M ABOUT TO BE REPLACED BY
A METRO CARD MACHINE ANYWAY.

10:56.371 --> 10:57.421
HEY!

10:57.489 --> 11:00.725
THERE'S THE MAN
I LOVE.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.526
WHOA, I GUESS SOMEBODY
HIT MARGARITA MADNESS

11:02.594 --> 11:04.428
ON THE WAY HOME, HUH?

11:04.496 --> 11:06.447
NO, BUT I DID
HIT HAPPY HOUR

11:06.514 --> 11:09.616
AT THE NORTH SHORE
RETIREMENT VILLAGE.

11:09.684 --> 11:11.368
WHOA, SOUNDS ROCKIN',
HOW WAS IT?

11:11.436 --> 11:12.820
OH MY GOD, DOUG,
HE'S GONNA LOVE IT.

11:12.887 --> 11:14.255
I MEAN, THEY HAVE PING-PONG,
CRAFTS, AND EVERY FRIDAY

11:14.323 --> 11:17.124
IS MAKE YOUR OWN
SUNDAE AND MOVIE NIGHT.

11:17.192 --> 11:18.075
MAYBE WE SHOULD
MOVE IN THERE AND

11:18.143 --> 11:19.243
GIVE HIM THE HOUSE.

11:19.310 --> 11:20.377
I KNOW, RIGHT?

11:20.445 --> 11:21.946
ANYWAY, I FILLED
OUT THE PAPERWORK.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.815
HE HAS ORIENTATION
ON SATURDAY, HE MOVES

11:23.882 --> 11:27.017
IN ON SUNDAY AND THEN YOU
GOT YOUR BASEMENT BACK.

11:27.085 --> 11:29.504
YEAH, I'M GONNA THROW
SOMETHING OUT AT YOU.

11:29.571 --> 11:32.339
LITTLE BIT
OF A CURVEBALL.

11:32.407 --> 11:33.491
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:33.558 --> 11:36.660
I SEE YOU GOT
YOUR GAME FACE ON.

11:36.728 --> 11:38.779
YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR LEMONS

11:38.847 --> 11:41.265
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKING LEMONADE.

11:43.001 --> 11:44.651
BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO, CARRIE.

11:44.719 --> 11:46.987
LOOK, YOU'RE MY WIFE AND
I KNOW HE'S YOUR DAD.

11:47.055 --> 11:48.773
IF YOU WANT HIM
HERE, HE CAN STAY.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.409
NOW COME ON,
BRING IT IN.

11:53.745 --> 11:55.279
OW!

11:55.346 --> 11:57.114
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' TO ME HERE?

11:57.181 --> 11:58.783
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:58.850 --> 12:00.100
THIS HAS BEEN THE HARDEST
DECISION FOR ME TO MAKE, DOUG.

12:00.168 --> 12:02.002
I FINALLY CONVINCED
MYSELF THAT PUTTING

12:02.070 --> 12:04.905
MY DAD IN A RETIREMENT HOME WAS
THE BEST THING FOR EVERYBODY.

12:04.972 --> 12:07.874
NOW YOUR SITTIN' HERE
TALKING ABOUT LEMONADE?

12:07.942 --> 12:10.294
I'M JUST SAYING I REALIZED
THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT,

12:10.362 --> 12:12.630
I DON'T MIND
HAVING HIM AROUND.

12:12.697 --> 12:14.365
OH, REALLY YOU
DON'T MIND IT?

12:14.432 --> 12:17.101
YOU WERE SWINGING A RAKE
AT HIM THE OTHER DAY.

12:17.169 --> 12:18.519
THAT'S HOW
WE PLAY, OKAY?

12:18.587 --> 12:20.404
OH, COME ON.

12:20.472 --> 12:23.206
I'M JUST SAYING, CARRIE,
HE'S NOT SUCH A BAD GUY.

12:23.274 --> 12:26.444
AND I JUST, I GOT A FEELING
HE'S DONE SOME PRETTY NICE

12:26.511 --> 12:27.745
THINGS IN HIS
LIFE FOR YOU.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.148
OH, REALLY?
NAME ONE.

12:33.868 --> 12:35.936
THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT.

12:48.449 --> 12:51.518
ARTHUR, WHAT ARE
YOU STILL DOING UP?

12:51.586 --> 12:53.687
UH, I COULDN'T SLEEP.

12:53.839 --> 12:57.674
CAN I INTEREST YOU IN
SOME OF YOUR SCOTCH?

12:59.211 --> 13:02.446
LISTEN, I WANT TO TELL
CARRIE ABOUT THE ACTING THING.

13:02.514 --> 13:03.580
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

13:03.648 --> 13:06.100
LISTEN, I THINK IF SHE
KNOWS ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW,

13:06.167 --> 13:10.270
SHE MAY CHANGE HER MIND
AND YOU COULD... STAY HERE.

13:10.338 --> 13:14.358
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WANT ME HERE?

13:14.425 --> 13:18.629
NO, I DON'T WANT
YOU HERE, NO.

13:18.697 --> 13:22.599
I'M USED TO THE NOISE,
YOU KNOW, SO, UH,

13:22.667 --> 13:24.035
CAN I TELL CARRIE?

13:24.102 --> 13:26.570
DOUGLAS, I'VE DONE A
LOT OF THINGS IN MY LIFE

13:26.638 --> 13:28.439
I'M NOT PROUD OF.

13:28.507 --> 13:31.208
I'VE WRITTEN THOUSANDS
OF BOGUS CHECKS.

13:31.276 --> 13:34.678
I STARTED FOREST FIRES.

13:34.746 --> 13:36.880
I SUCKER PUNCHED
A LADY COP.

13:39.317 --> 13:40.685
BUT THE ONE GOOD THING
I'VE DONE IN MY LIFE

13:40.752 --> 13:45.656
IS TO NOT LET HER
KNOW ABOUT THIS.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.991
AND WHEN I GET TO THOSE
PEARLY GATES THAT'S ALL I GOT.

13:49.511 --> 13:52.746
I'M JUST SAYING, LOOK,
I'M GONNA TAKE OUT A LOAN.

13:52.814 --> 13:54.748
AND I'M GONNA TURN THAT
BASEMENT INTO MY MEDIA ROOM.

13:54.816 --> 13:57.818
SO I'M JUST SAYIN', LOOK,
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.

13:57.885 --> 14:02.790
DOUGLAS, PULL THE TRIGGER
ON THAT MEDIA ROOM.

14:02.857 --> 14:04.859
YOU SURE THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT?

14:04.926 --> 14:09.996
WHAT I WANT IS THAT YOU AND
CARRIE HAVE A WONDERFUL LIFE

14:10.064 --> 14:11.699
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE IT.

14:13.935 --> 14:16.937
THANKS, ARTHUR.

14:17.005 --> 14:18.205
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:18.273 --> 14:19.840
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE ANY TROUBLE

14:19.908 --> 14:21.575
GETTING INTO
THOSE PEARLY GATES.

14:21.643 --> 14:24.345
THANK YOU, DOUGLAS.

14:24.412 --> 14:26.046
WANT TO SEE ME
IN A PRELL COMMERCIAL?

14:26.114 --> 14:28.415
LET HER RIP.

14:33.021 --> 14:35.589
AND THIS
IS OUR REC ROOM,

14:35.656 --> 14:38.125
WHERE THE RESIDENTS HAVE
A FULL RANGE OF ACTIVITIES.

14:38.193 --> 14:40.727
THEY'VE GOT CARDS,
AND BOARD GAMES

14:40.795 --> 14:42.162
AND PENNY BINGO.

14:42.230 --> 14:44.031
OH, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE FUN, RIGHT, DAD?

14:44.099 --> 14:45.332
UH-HUH.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.236
NOW, WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU
THE ROOMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE.

15:09.624 --> 15:11.342
DAD, COME ON.

15:26.007 --> 15:28.375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:28.443 --> 15:29.910
AH, LISTENING TO MUSIC.

15:29.978 --> 15:33.630
CAN YOU TURN IT DOWN?
I'M TRYING TO SLEEP.

15:33.698 --> 15:35.015
YEAH, WELL, THIS WHOLE THING
COULD HAVE BEEN OVER WITH

15:35.083 --> 15:37.384
IF YOU JUST MOVED ALL YOUR
CRAP BACK TO WHERE IT BELONGED.

15:37.452 --> 15:38.318
NO WAY.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.537
NOW COME ON, I GOTTA
GET UP EARLY FOR WORK.

15:40.605 --> 15:43.674
THAT'S IF I WAS GOING.

15:43.741 --> 15:45.743
FINE, YOU BIG BABY.

15:54.769 --> 15:56.503
WHAT'S ALL THIS JUNK
ALL OVER THE CEILING?

15:56.571 --> 15:58.872
DUH, IT'S
THE UNIVERSE, GENIUS.

15:58.940 --> 16:02.442
THOSE ARE GLOW
IN THE DARK STICKERS.

16:04.312 --> 16:06.313
I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:06.380 --> 16:09.199
AND THAT'S THE BIG DIPPER
RIGHT OVER THERE.

16:09.267 --> 16:11.368
NO, THAT'S
ORION'S BELT.

16:11.436 --> 16:14.571
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO A PLANETARIUM?

16:14.639 --> 16:16.474
THE BIG DIPPER'S
WAY OVER THERE.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.042
WHAT, THAT THING?

16:18.110 --> 16:19.576
NO, THAT'S CASSIOPEIA.

16:19.644 --> 16:22.980
THE BIG DIPPER'S RIGHT
THERE, SEE THE HANDLE?

16:22.997 --> 16:24.482
OH, YEAH.

16:25.683 --> 16:27.951
WOW, YOU SURE KNOW
A LOT ABOUT THIS STUFF.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.420
HEY, WHEN YOU'RE
IN THE 10TH GRADE

16:29.488 --> 16:32.589
AND YOU'RE 4'10"
AND STILL HAIRLESS,

16:32.657 --> 16:36.760
THIS IS...

16:36.828 --> 16:40.731
THIS IS SOMETHING TO
DO ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.

16:43.584 --> 16:46.854
SO I WANT THE PROJECTION TV
WITH THE 6-FOOT SCREEN

16:46.921 --> 16:48.989
AND THE, UH, DELUXE
SURROUND SOUND.

16:49.057 --> 16:51.324
WHAT SIZE SPEAKERS
WERE YOU THINKING?

16:51.392 --> 16:52.275
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.

16:52.343 --> 16:54.277
I DON'T WANT THE SOUND
JUST TO SURROUND ME,

16:54.345 --> 16:56.013
I WANT IT IN ME.

16:57.148 --> 16:59.616
I'LL PUT YOU DOWN
FOR THE BRONCO PACKAGE.

16:59.684 --> 17:02.369
ALL RIGHT, BRONCO.

17:06.007 --> 17:07.790
HEY, ART ATTACK.

17:07.858 --> 17:10.527
DOUGLAS, CAN WE
TALK FOR A SEC?

17:10.595 --> 17:11.528
YEAH.

17:11.596 --> 17:13.097
REMEMBER HOW YOU
WANTED TO TELL CARRIE

17:13.164 --> 17:14.798
ABOUT MY GIVING UP
MY DREAM FOR HER?

17:14.865 --> 17:16.366
YEAH.

17:16.434 --> 17:18.269
WELL, YOU CAN PULL
THE TRIGGER ON THAT.

17:18.336 --> 17:19.703
WHAT?

17:19.771 --> 17:22.638
YEAH, THAT RETIREMENT HOME
IS DEATH, I DON'T WANT TO GO.

17:22.707 --> 17:24.207
BUT, ARTHUR,
IT'S TOO LATE.

17:24.358 --> 17:26.993
YOU ALREADY TOLD ME TO PULL
THE TRIGGER ON THE MEDIA ROOM.

17:27.061 --> 17:28.712
I'M CHANGING MY MIND.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.247
BUT YOU SAID IT WAS
THE ONE GOOD THING

17:30.314 --> 17:32.049
YOU DID IN YOUR LIFE,
AND IT WAS GONNA GET YOU

17:32.117 --> 17:33.450
THROUGH THE PEARLY GATES.

17:33.517 --> 17:35.019
LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES,
I'M GOING TO HELL

17:35.086 --> 17:36.787
AND YOU KNOW IT!

17:37.989 --> 17:39.056
NOW PULL THE TRIGGER.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.058
ARTHUR, YOU ARE
MAKING ME CRAZY.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.893
THESE LAST FEW DAYS,
YOU'RE GOING, YOU'RE STAYING.

17:42.961 --> 17:44.394
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.196
CARRIE IS FINE WITH YOU GOIN',
I'M FINE WITH YOU GOIN'.

17:46.264 --> 17:48.499
SO YOU BETTER GET FINE
WITH IT, YOU GOT IT?

17:51.318 --> 17:53.637
SO WE'LL PUT
A PIN IN IT?

17:57.658 --> 17:58.609
ALL RIGHT, DOUG,
WE'RE LEAVING.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.561
OKAY.

18:01.629 --> 18:03.780
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
PULL THE CAR AROUND.

18:03.848 --> 18:05.015
YOU GUYS SAY YOUR
GOODBYES, OKAY?

18:12.023 --> 18:15.341
WELL, UH,
GOOD LUCK, ARTHUR.

18:15.409 --> 18:17.060
THANK YOU.

18:17.128 --> 18:19.029
AND WHAT CAN
I SAY, EXCEPT...

18:19.097 --> 18:21.531
I HOPE YOU DIE,
YOU FAT PIG.

18:33.127 --> 18:34.778
AND TO THIS DAY...

18:34.845 --> 18:38.215
MY DAD STILL HASN'T FORGIVEN
ME FOR QUITTING THE SAXOPHONE.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.484
I MEAN, HE COULDN'T
GRASP THE FACT THAT

18:40.552 --> 18:42.986
I HAD ASTHMA AND THAT
EVERY TIME I PLAYED A SONG

18:43.054 --> 18:45.955
I PUT MY LIFE
ON THE LINE.

18:48.426 --> 18:50.043
WELL, AT LEAST YOUR
DAD STUCK AROUND.

18:50.111 --> 18:52.178
I MEAN, I'VE ALWAYS
WONDERED, LIKE,

18:52.247 --> 18:55.282
IF I'D BEEN TALLER
OR BETTER AT SPORTS,

18:55.350 --> 18:56.950
MAYBE HE WOULD
HAVE STAYED.

18:57.017 --> 19:00.604
HEY, DO NOT BLAME
YOURSELF, HE LEFT YOU.

19:00.672 --> 19:02.489
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:03.825 --> 19:06.359
OH MY GOD, THE SUN'S
COMING UP.

19:06.427 --> 19:09.429
WOW, WE'VE BEEN
TALKIN' ALL NIGHT.

19:13.768 --> 19:14.868
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:14.936 --> 19:16.703
YOU CAN HAVE THIS ROOM.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.772
REALLY?

19:18.839 --> 19:19.839
YEP.

19:19.907 --> 19:21.275
I MADE A PROMISE
TO YOU ON THAT NAPKIN

19:21.342 --> 19:22.576
AND I'M GONNA
STICK TO IT.

19:22.644 --> 19:24.428
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

19:24.495 --> 19:26.463
HEY, WAIT
WAIT WAIT.

19:26.531 --> 19:28.365
MAYBE YOU DON'T
HAVE TO MOVE OUT.

19:29.367 --> 19:30.267
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:30.335 --> 19:31.534
IF WE SHARED
A VANITY WE COULD

19:31.602 --> 19:34.504
FIT ALL OUR
STUFF IN HERE.

19:35.773 --> 19:37.174
REALLY?

19:37.242 --> 19:39.343
YEAH, AND WE COULD
TURN THE OTHER BEDROOM

19:39.410 --> 19:40.477
INTO A SITTING ROOM.

19:40.545 --> 19:41.661
I LIKE SITTING.

19:41.729 --> 19:43.113
YEAH, AND YOU KNOW
WHAT, WE COULD PUT

19:43.181 --> 19:44.481
A FOLD-OUT COUCH
IN THERE SO IF ONE

19:44.549 --> 19:45.583
OF US HAS
A GIRL OVER

19:45.650 --> 19:47.518
THE OTHER GUY HAS
A PLACE TO CRASH.

19:47.586 --> 19:52.689
YEAH, MIGHT GET MORE USE
OUT OF A FOOSBALL TABLE, BUT...

19:53.108 --> 19:55.492
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:59.331 --> 20:01.098
HEY, HONEY,
I'M DOWN HERE!

20:01.165 --> 20:05.902
HEY, I HAVE A GREAT
NIGHT SET UP FOR US.

20:05.970 --> 20:09.473
<i>I HAVE YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES,
PORKY'S, AND PORK RINDS.</i>

20:09.541 --> 20:12.075
HUH, JUST YOU AND
ME IN OUR HOUSE.

20:12.143 --> 20:14.111
HONEY, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
THE ROOM LOOKS GREAT.

20:14.178 --> 20:16.413
I MEAN, I REALLY DIDN'T THINK
ALL THIS STUFF WAS GONNA WORK

20:16.481 --> 20:17.948
LIKE THIS CARPET, THE
BLACK AND BURGUNDY THING.

20:18.015 --> 20:20.650
A LITTLE DANNY TERRIO
BUT IT DOES WORK IN HERE.

20:20.718 --> 20:22.169
AND THAT JETS
HELMET IS...

20:25.974 --> 20:27.941
I CAN'T DO
THIS, DOUG.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.027
I'M SORRY,
I TRIED, BUT I...

20:30.094 --> 20:31.261
I WANT HIM BACK.

20:31.329 --> 20:33.463
PLEASE.

20:33.531 --> 20:36.015
I PROMISE, I WILL WASH
HIM, I WILL FEED HIM.

20:36.083 --> 20:39.519
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW THAT
HE'S HERE, I PROM-

20:43.190 --> 20:44.858
DAD.

20:44.926 --> 20:45.859
THERE SHE IS!

20:45.927 --> 20:47.561
HI, WELCOME BACK.

20:47.628 --> 20:50.030
OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE BACK.

20:50.098 --> 20:52.816
THANK YOU, IT'S
GOOD BEING BACK.

20:52.883 --> 20:57.488
