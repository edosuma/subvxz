02:48.067 --> 02:50.270
{\an1}AT THE ZOO?

02:50.336 --> 02:52.539
{\an1}BECAUSE APES ARE SO WISE,

02:52.605 --> 02:54.741
{\an1}AND STRONG, AND SILENT

02:54.807 --> 02:57.577

{\an1}ON TOP OF A SHERMAN TANK,

03:07.787 --> 03:08.688
{\an1}GOING DOWN FIFTH AVENUE,

03:08.755 --> 03:10.690

03:14.193 --> 03:16.462
{\an1}ON THAT ONE.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.997
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.332

03:19.399 --> 03:20.633
{\an1}FREEZE IT, AND YOU RIDE DOWN IT

03:20.700 --> 03:21.367
{\an1}ON A ZAMBONI,

03:21.434 --> 03:24.404
{\an1}WHICH WOULD BE DRIVEN BY ME.

03:24.470 --> 03:25.905

03:26.973 --> 03:28.975
{\an1}SOMETHING.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.877
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAX, IF I MAY?

03:30.944 --> 03:32.111
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT, HIBBERT?

03:32.178 --> 03:33.112
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THINK THE KID

03:33.179 --> 03:34.380
{\an1}IS ON TO SOMETHING.

03:34.447 --> 03:35.014

03:35.081 --> 03:35.415
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HE IS?

03:35.481 --> 03:36.549
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I AM?

03:36.616 --> 03:36.916

{\an1}INSTEAD OF JUST A PHOTO SHOOT,

03:38.351 --> 03:39.319
{\an1}WE DO SOME KIND OF STUNT

03:39.385 --> 03:42.789
{\an1}THAT WILL CREATE A MEDIA BUZZ.

{\an1}DID MR. MADIGAN SEEM NERVOUS

05:09.175 --> 05:10.143
{\an1}TO YOU?

05:10.209 --> 05:11.177
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NERVOUS HOW?

05:11.244 --> 05:12.178
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, HE KEPT PLAYING

05:12.245 --> 05:13.479
{\an1}WITH A BUTTON ON HIS JACKET.

05:13.546 --> 05:14.881
{\an1}AND THEN IT CAME OFF,

05:14.947 --> 05:16.115
{\an1}AND THEN HE ATE IT.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.450
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, I SAW THAT.

05:17.517 --> 05:18.618
{\an1}I ALSO SAW HIM PICK A NICKEL

05:18.685 --> 05:19.085
{\an1}OFF THE FLOOR,

05:19.152 --> 05:20.453
{\an1}AND THEN HE ATE THAT, TOO.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T

05:21.754 --> 05:23.456
{\an1}EAT THINGS OFF THE FLOOR.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.158
{\an1}I LEARNED THAT THE HARD WAY.

05:25.224 --> 05:25.892
{\an1}THIS ONE TIME IN SEVENTH GRADE

05:25.958 --> 05:27.260
{\an1}I SWALLOWED A COMB.

{\an1}DIDN'T SEE IT AGAIN

{\an1}I'LL BET I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.211

05:45.278 --> 05:45.745
{\an1}&gt;&gt; REALLY?

05:45.812 --> 05:46.379
{\an1}YOU DON'T MIND STANDING

05:49.182 --> 05:50.616
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AN ACTUAL DUMMY,

{\an1}AS HITTING THE GROUND

06:32.525 --> 06:35.528
{\an1}AT AN ENORMOUS RATE OF SPEED.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.095
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE WERE THINKING

06:36.162 --> 06:36.796
{\an1}WE COULD GET A DUMMY

06:36.863 --> 06:38.064
{\an1}TO TAKE YOUR PLACE.
