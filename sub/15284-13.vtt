03:05.854 --> 03:07.956
So I went Reid-like
and I did a bunch of research

03:08.024 --> 03:09.891

that nuts and seeds

03:09.959 --> 03:11.459
have naturally occurring
magnesium,

03:11.527 --> 03:15.129
and magnesium influences

13:01.956 --> 13:04.190
Hey, Reid, it's Derek. Listen,
I got a work question for you.

13:04.258 --> 13:07.059
The unsub's exsanguinating victims
and removing their eyelids antemortem.

13:07.128 --> 13:09.596
Does that mean anything
to you? Hit me back.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.298
[Door opens]

13:12.366 --> 13:15.468
Here's the information
you called about.

13:15.536 --> 13:16.536
Thank you.

13:16.604 --> 13:19.438
[Cell phone rings]

13:20.340 --> 13:22.307
Excuse me for a second.

13:22.375 --> 13:24.909
What's up, Reid?

13:24.977 --> 13:27.712
Have the cornea or pupils
been harmed in any way?

13:27.780 --> 13:30.849
No, no. Blake said it looked like a very
sharp instrument was used.

13:30.916 --> 13:33.318
If he's taking care
not to damage the eyes,

13:33.386 --> 13:36.320
then line of sight is probably
what's important to him.

13:36.388 --> 13:39.824
So this guy wants them
to see what he's doing.

13:41.994 --> 13:45.664
Hey, Reid. How are you?

13:45.731 --> 13:48.299
I gotta go.

13:54.505 --> 13:56.273
Sorry about that.

13:56.340 --> 13:57.641
Not a problem.

13:57.709 --> 14:00.243
Cause of death would
definitely be exsanguination.

14:00.311 --> 14:01.985
But the tox screen
showed high levels of--

14:01.986 --> 14:05.639
say this 5 times fast--
ethylene diamine tetra acetic.

14:05.684 --> 14:07.416
EDTA. It's an anti-coagulant.

14:07.484 --> 14:10.352
Used mostly to treat
heart conditions.

14:10.420 --> 14:12.989
So the unsub probably
used it to thin the blood.

14:13.057 --> 14:14.991
The ketamine we found
may have helped as well.

14:15.059 --> 14:17.093
In humans, it tends
to elevate blood pressure.

14:17.161 --> 14:18.695
Which is how
he's sedating them.

14:18.762 --> 14:21.530
If he knew that he was giving
these drugs to these victims

14:21.598 --> 14:23.098
and he ingested the blood?

14:23.166 --> 14:24.666
He'd be dosing himself
as well.

14:24.734 --> 14:26.902
Well, that rules out vampirism.

14:26.969 --> 14:29.071
Is there any chance this guy works
in the medical field?

14:29.138 --> 14:31.740
I doubt it. There are a few
hesitation marks near the wound,

14:31.808 --> 14:34.710
and the hole in the artery
shows a lot of bruising around it.

14:34.777 --> 14:36.011
I'd say
it's amateur at best.

14:36.079 --> 14:37.913
All right,
so we got an unsub

14:37.980 --> 14:40.014
who's picking his victims
at random,

14:40.082 --> 14:41.949
sedates them,
then bleeds them dry.

14:42.017 --> 14:46.854
If he's not drinking the blood,
what the hell is he doing with it?

15:05.106 --> 15:07.373
Wait...

15:07.441 --> 15:08.708
Wait...

15:08.776 --> 15:09.843
[Breathing hard]

15:09.910 --> 15:12.277
Shh, shh, shh. Be still.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.046
What's--what--
what are you doing?

15:14.114 --> 15:16.648
Wait--wait--aah!

15:31.359 --> 15:33.226
Well, we got a hit
off the prints.

15:33.294 --> 15:35.829
The victim's name
is Aimee Fortner.

15:37.732 --> 15:40.534
It's only been a day
since his last kill.

15:40.601 --> 15:43.169
Well, this guy doesn't
have a cool-down period.

15:43.237 --> 15:44.938
Rigor hasn't set in yet.

15:45.005 --> 15:47.640
I'd say she was put here
maybe an hour ago,

15:47.708 --> 15:49.007
just after sunrise.

15:49.075 --> 15:50.242
He's getting brazen.

15:50.310 --> 15:51.910
It's his first daytime
disposal.

15:51.978 --> 15:54.714
Well, this part of the park's
not very well traveled.

15:54.781 --> 15:56.849
The city's been trying
to renovate every couple of years,

15:56.916 --> 15:58.617
but you know--politics.

15:58.685 --> 16:01.019
So the unsub is familiar
enough with the area

16:01.087 --> 16:03.054
to know nobody would
disturb him.

16:03.121 --> 16:05.590
Office of omnipotence.
How may I dazzle you?

16:05.658 --> 16:08.626
Garcia, I need information
on the latest victim, Aimee Fortner.

16:08.694 --> 16:11.629
Information is my favorite
way to dazzle, sir.

16:11.697 --> 16:12.964
So sparkly.

16:13.031 --> 16:14.866
Here we go
Aimee Crystal Fortner.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.300
Originally from Santa Clara.

16:16.369 --> 16:17.569
She was super pretty.

16:17.636 --> 16:19.603
When she wasn't bartending,
she supplemented her income

16:19.671 --> 16:21.538
by modeling.

16:21.606 --> 16:22.939
A model?

16:23.007 --> 16:24.842
Yes. And she's
got a website

16:24.909 --> 16:27.811
full of very artistic
pictures of herself.

16:27.879 --> 16:31.815
Girl was not afraid to flaunt
what God gave her at all.

16:31.883 --> 16:34.517
Uh-huh.
Thanks, Garcia.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.789
What are you thinking?

16:43.527 --> 16:45.728
Reid told Morgan
line of sight

16:45.796 --> 16:49.565
was important to the unsub.

16:53.903 --> 16:56.772
We should take a look
at the other crime scenes.

16:56.839 --> 16:59.408
I might know what he's
doing with the blood.

17:05.647 --> 17:09.250
We believe that this unsub
is a white male in his 20s or 30s,

17:09.318 --> 17:12.752
and he thinks of himself
as a painter or an artist.

17:12.820 --> 17:16.490
The placement of the
victims tells us a lot about who he is.

17:16.558 --> 17:19.193
Pamela Hurd was found
near a painting done by

17:19.261 --> 17:21.595
little known San Francisco artist
Henry Floyd.

17:21.663 --> 17:24.131
Gary Porter was posed near
a piece of graffiti art

17:24.198 --> 17:27.401
by a street artist named Cypher, who is
currently wanted by the police.

17:27.468 --> 17:29.702
Hotch: And the third victim, Lynn Stevens,
was found near a mural

17:29.770 --> 17:31.271
painted by inner city youths.

17:31.339 --> 17:35.242
Finally, Aimee Fortner was placed
near the statue of Saint Luke,

17:35.310 --> 17:37.144
patron Saint of the artist.

17:37.211 --> 17:39.111
JJ: This is a compulsion.
It's not accidental.

17:39.179 --> 17:40.746
He is obsessed with art.

17:40.814 --> 17:42.598
Rossi: All of the works
of art are neglected,

17:42.623 --> 17:44.566
ignored, cast aside.

17:44.751 --> 17:46.318
It's how he feels
about himself.

17:46.322 --> 17:47.973
Hotch: We believe it's also
the reason that he's evolved

17:47.998 --> 17:49.557
to removing the victims eyelids.

17:49.638 --> 17:52.139
He's forcing them to see
what he sees.

17:52.207 --> 17:54.275
There's no sexual component
with these murders,

17:54.343 --> 17:57.378
but that's because the blood
and the use of the blood

17:57.445 --> 17:58.912
is his sexual release.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.313
So, wait.

18:00.382 --> 18:02.516
What--what is he doing
with the blood?

18:02.584 --> 18:04.084
Because he's so obsessed
with art,

18:04.151 --> 18:05.819
we believe
he's painting with it.

18:05.887 --> 18:07.654
Rossi: He has a quick
kill pace.

18:07.722 --> 18:09.322
More blood means more paint.

18:09.391 --> 18:11.491
The more paintings he does,

18:11.558 --> 18:14.494
the greater the chance
someone will recognize his work.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.396
We think that because
of his need for acceptance,

18:16.463 --> 18:18.163
he may be trying
to sell the paintings.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.999
So focus your canvassing
on places

18:20.066 --> 18:22.802
that might sell
this kind of fringe art.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.388

18:46.024 --> 18:47.658

18:47.726 --> 18:49.727

District area.

some of the files.

in San Francisco.

19:12.316 --> 19:14.383
how are you?

19:14.451 --> 19:15.651
Better.

19:15.718 --> 19:18.053

19:18.120 --> 19:19.988
And thanks for the baskets.

19:20.056 --> 19:22.190

I know.

19:27.497 --> 19:29.932
Okay, galleries.
I got a lot.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.800

19:35.003 --> 19:37.605
I guess that's better
than nothing.

19:37.673 --> 19:39.474
It is. I will take it.

19:39.541 --> 19:42.977
Okay, there's still a few galleries,
but it's more manageable.

19:43.044 --> 19:44.684
I am sending the addresses
to your mobile.

19:44.713 --> 19:47.213
I got it. Thanks, Garcia.

literally on his deathbed.

to make me an offer.

20:18.277 --> 20:19.377

I can tell him to leave.

pleased with my piece this time.

the last time,

I'm not interested.

20:42.133 --> 20:43.967

this type of art

is just not what
we're looking for.

you're getting better.

20:57.748 --> 21:03.253

is it's a little simplistic.

Look, every good artist leaves
a piece of himself on the canvas.

21:08.391 --> 21:10.092

that one thing

what I'm talking about.

doesn't make sense.

22:09.082 --> 22:11.016
No.

22:11.084 --> 22:14.019
No, but there was a guy
in here a couple days ago

22:14.087 --> 22:15.487
who tried to sell me
a piece like that.

22:15.554 --> 22:17.889
It wasn't exactly my taste,

22:17.957 --> 22:19.857
but a customer of mine
happened to be in here,

22:19.925 --> 22:23.161
saw it, fell in love with it,
bought it on sight.

22:24.396 --> 22:26.664
You think that
could that be your guy?

22:26.732 --> 22:29.033
You wouldn't happen to have any
security cameras in here, would you?

22:29.101 --> 22:30.868
No.

We need the customer's
name if you've got it.

22:32.638 --> 22:34.338
Yeah.

22:51.688 --> 22:54.323
I never quite understood
these things.

22:54.391 --> 22:57.293
It all looks like the guy had
a seizure while painting it.

22:57.361 --> 23:00.496
It's Emile Hartford.

23:00.564 --> 23:03.633
It's early 20th century.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.668
His daughter died
when she was 8.

23:05.735 --> 23:09.204
He said every time he painted,
he'd be able to see her.

23:09.272 --> 23:12.174
Don't know how you see
anything in there.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.379
I guess that's why they say
art is in the eye of the beholder.

23:18.947 --> 23:21.183
Yeah.

gonna make me ask

We're friends.

now. I'd hope so.

painting to this place?

of the eighties.

Probably.

Welcome. My name is Andre.

to fill out a small waiver.

No, no, no.
We're not a couple.

That's okay. We cater
to all kinds of relationships.

for a painting you bought recently.

You're gonna have to be
a bit more specific.

24:54.604 --> 24:57.105
I'm a connoisseur
of the dark and depraved arts.

24:57.173 --> 24:59.574
I purchase a lot of paintings.

24:59.642 --> 25:01.242
Well, you bought this one
a couple of days ago.

25:01.310 --> 25:02.510

a lot of paintings.

25:05.981 --> 25:07.415
I don't remember them all.

25:07.483 --> 25:10.485
Oh, really? Because
last I checked,

25:10.552 --> 25:13.488
withholding evidence
would make you an accomplice.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.054
We just want to see
the painting.

25:15.122 --> 25:19.259
Just want to see if it's from
the guy we're looking for.

25:20.895 --> 25:22.729
Remembering now?

25:22.797 --> 25:24.665
Possibly.

25:24.732 --> 25:30.504
For that piece, you'll have to
follow me to the spanking room.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.439
I may have bought it,
but I didn't realize

25:33.473 --> 25:36.375
it was evidence
of any sort.

25:36.443 --> 25:38.978
Is that that
you're looking for?

25:41.816 --> 25:45.418
The tortured look in her eyes
is what first drew me to it.

25:45.452 --> 25:49.855
The guy was asking 1,500 for it.
I got him to take 250, cash.

25:49.889 --> 25:52.624
That's our first victim,
Pamela Hurd.

25:52.692 --> 25:55.294
It's definitely from our guy.

25:55.361 --> 25:58.030
Yeah, we're gonna need
to take this.

26:06.705 --> 26:10.808
[Muttering]

26:10.876 --> 26:13.044
What are you doing?

26:14.847 --> 26:16.881
What...

26:17.782 --> 26:19.349
What...

26:19.416 --> 26:21.351
What's going on?

26:23.387 --> 26:25.222
It...

26:25.323 --> 26:27.457
Wawa.

26:27.524 --> 26:29.826
What--

26:30.895 --> 26:33.730
no, please don't.

26:35.498 --> 26:37.233
Why?

26:38.468 --> 26:42.137
It's the only way.

26:42.205 --> 26:43.939
Sorry.

26:44.007 --> 26:45.741
You're insane.

26:46.776 --> 26:48.978
I guess every artist
is a little crazy.

26:49.045 --> 26:50.945
No, come on man,
we're friends.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.780
Exactly.

26:53.949 --> 26:57.818
It's what I've been missing.
Something personal.

27:00.689 --> 27:03.557
I need you to hold still.

27:05.861 --> 27:07.961
Hold still.

27:07.996 --> 27:10.497
Hold still..

27:10.564 --> 27:11.831
Hold still!

27:11.900 --> 27:13.400
Help!

27:13.467 --> 27:14.401
[Grunting]

27:14.468 --> 27:17.437
No! Aah!

27:18.306 --> 27:20.740
No!

27:25.379 --> 27:27.079
No...No!

27:41.771 --> 27:45.072
Well, we now have
a piece of his art,

27:45.140 --> 27:47.508
but we still don't have
anything to identify the unsub.

27:47.575 --> 27:49.810
The lab's got a sample, but it's
probably Pamela Hurd's blood.

27:49.878 --> 27:52.546
Master Andre said he was
an average white guy

27:52.614 --> 27:54.281
in his late 20s
to early 30s.

27:54.348 --> 27:57.083
Same thing the gallery owner said.
He signed it.

27:57.151 --> 28:01.622
Yeah, it looks like
a "B" something or something "B".

28:01.689 --> 28:04.024
I'm going to have Garcia
compile a list of artists

28:04.091 --> 28:06.126
with the letter "B"
somewhere in their name.

28:06.193 --> 28:09.296
It's not much,
but it's something.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.674
We got the report back
from the lab.

30:07.742 --> 30:09.676
They couldn't extract
any DNA from the painting.

30:09.744 --> 30:12.712
They said something about there
only being red blood cells.

30:12.780 --> 30:15.548
Hmm. He removed
the white blood cells.

30:15.615 --> 30:16.882
Plasma.

30:16.950 --> 30:19.251
Why would he take
the plasma?

30:19.318 --> 30:21.219
It would make it thicker.
Easier to use as a paint.

30:21.287 --> 30:23.388
What type of equipment
would it take to do that?

30:23.456 --> 30:26.091
You can easily buy
a centrifuge online these days

30:26.159 --> 30:27.502
for a couple hundred
bucks.

30:27.602 --> 30:29.132
What other reasons would
he have for separating

30:29.157 --> 30:30.529
the plasma from the blood?

30:30.530 --> 30:32.664
It's a habit.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.967
- Reid.
- Spence.

30:40.839 --> 30:44.476
I didn't expect you back this soon.
You sure you're ready?

30:44.544 --> 30:47.844
No, but I think
I figured something out.

30:59.324 --> 31:00.324
Where's Mrs. Riley?

31:00.392 --> 31:01.258
You need to leave.

31:01.326 --> 31:02.925
It's okay, Alan,
I'll handle it.

31:04.728 --> 31:07.430
I did what you said.

31:07.498 --> 31:11.934
This is my friend, Paul.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.609
I even used
some of my own blood.

31:20.677 --> 31:23.512
That's not what I meant.

31:24.982 --> 31:26.682
But you said if I made it
more personal,

31:26.750 --> 31:29.051
you'd use me
in your gallery.

31:31.387 --> 31:33.823
Look, I've been trying to be nice
and give you some encouragement,

31:33.890 --> 31:35.991
but I can see now that that's
really not gonna help you.

31:36.058 --> 31:38.960
So I think I just
have to be blunt.

31:39.028 --> 31:41.529
It's not good.

31:44.133 --> 31:45.233
But...

31:45.300 --> 31:47.468
This is--

31:47.536 --> 31:49.403
this is abstract.

31:49.471 --> 31:50.738
I understand the concept,

31:50.805 --> 31:52.673
but splashing something
onto a canvas,

31:52.741 --> 31:54.675
that doesn't make it art.

31:54.743 --> 32:00.213
Some people have it,
some people don't.

32:02.717 --> 32:04.351
You don't know
what you're talking about.

32:04.418 --> 32:07.353
Maybe not, but that still doesn't mean
that I'm gonna buy this.

32:07.420 --> 32:08.788
But you said--

32:08.856 --> 32:10.322
Look, I don't know how
to explain this to you any better.

32:10.390 --> 32:13.893
There is a difference
between a dream and a talent.

32:19.066 --> 32:20.332
Look, I'm sorry.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.834
If there's someone
that you--

32:29.842 --> 32:31.710
He's a hemophiliac.

32:31.778 --> 32:35.013
That would explain
his obsession with blood.

32:35.081 --> 32:37.615
He can't bleed without
a fear of dying.

32:37.684 --> 32:40.084
It's also why he would
separate the plasma from the blood

32:40.152 --> 32:41.451
before painting with it.

32:41.519 --> 32:43.620
It's an antiquated treatment,
but some hemophiliacs

32:43.689 --> 32:45.522
can inject plasma
into their wounds,

32:45.590 --> 32:49.359
kick-starting the clotting process
that's ineffective in their own systems.

32:49.427 --> 32:50.828
Talk about it.

32:50.896 --> 32:54.131
Hey, girlie, I need a list of
hemophiliacs in San Francisco.

32:54.199 --> 32:57.100
Vague. So vague. Okay.

32:57.168 --> 32:59.335
Garcia, for his obsession
to be this profound,

32:59.403 --> 33:01.738
he most likely has the more
severe version of the disease.

33:01.806 --> 33:04.040
It's type B Christmas disease.

33:04.108 --> 33:07.343
Reid, happy to hear
you made it safe and sound.

33:07.411 --> 33:08.745
Thank you, Garcia.

33:08.813 --> 33:11.847
Okay, Christmas disease.
It does not sound very jolly.

33:11.915 --> 33:14.235
It was named after the first known case,
Stephen Christmas.

33:14.250 --> 33:17.186
All right, I got 15 people
who have trouble clotting.

33:17.253 --> 33:19.013
He wouldn't stray too
far from the art world.

33:19.022 --> 33:20.522
Most likely works in and
around the art community,

33:20.547 --> 33:21.556
but not as an artist.

33:21.557 --> 33:23.491
And he's a loner.
So look for people with jobs

33:23.559 --> 33:25.761
where they don't interact
with the public.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.395
Yeah. Yeah. I got 3.

33:27.463 --> 33:29.698
Stock boy at a local
supermarket, an art blogger,

33:29.765 --> 33:30.732
and a custodian.

33:30.799 --> 33:32.934
The victims have
different blood types.

33:33.001 --> 33:36.438
If he's taking the plasma
out of the blood,

33:36.505 --> 33:38.440
he must be
a universal recipient.

33:38.507 --> 33:40.675
Any of them
with AB-positive blood?

33:40.743 --> 33:43.510
Specificity. I dig it.

33:43.578 --> 33:47.514
Okay, if I factor in those "B" names
I was working on...

33:47.582 --> 33:49.182
And bingo is his name-o.

33:49.251 --> 33:51.218
Actually, his name
is Bryan Hughes.

33:51.286 --> 33:53.220
He is an AB-positive
hemophiliac

33:53.288 --> 33:55.422
who works as a janitor
at the Bay Area Museum of Art,

33:55.490 --> 33:58.090
and before you ask, yes, his
address has been sent to your phones.

33:58.092 --> 33:59.392
You're the best,
baby girl.

33:59.460 --> 34:00.860
Dave, you and Blake
take the museum.

34:00.894 --> 34:03.529
The rest of us
will take the residence.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.067
I'm okay.

34:08.135 --> 34:11.036
Yeah. But it's good
to see you.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.174
You really don't need to be here
if you're not ready.

34:15.242 --> 34:17.175
This is going to
take time.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.447
How much time?

34:22.514 --> 34:24.949
It's hard to say.

34:25.016 --> 34:27.118
But we're all here
for you.

34:28.487 --> 34:30.121
Thank you.

35:33.245 --> 35:36.181
[sirens]

35:36.949 --> 35:38.434
Hey, what you got, mama?

35:38.435 --> 35:41.237
A compelling piece of information
about this Bryan Hughes.

35:41.304 --> 35:42.371
3 weeks before
the first murder,

35:42.439 --> 35:44.006
he was involved
in a car accident.

35:44.073 --> 35:45.206
Hotch:
Was he injured?

35:45.274 --> 35:47.109
Uh, no. And if you were
looking at the pictures I am

35:47.176 --> 35:48.644
you would say
that is a miracle.

35:48.711 --> 35:51.613
It may have given him
the impression he couldn't be hurt.

35:51.681 --> 35:54.683
The other driver was hurt.
She bled to death.

35:54.751 --> 35:57.185
Hughes called 911, failed to mention there
was another driver involved.

35:57.253 --> 35:58.520
By the time emergency
crews got there,

35:58.587 --> 36:00.027
thanks, Garcia.
She had already died.

36:00.088 --> 36:03.858
Watching the other woman bleed
to death must have been the trigger.

36:03.925 --> 36:05.726
[Cell phone rings]
Hey, what you got, pretty boy?

36:05.794 --> 36:07.628
I think Hughes may have
his next victim.

36:07.696 --> 36:10.564
An Alan archer just came in
and reported his boss missing.

36:10.632 --> 36:13.367
Madison Riley owns
an art gallery in the Mission District.

36:13.434 --> 36:15.335
Said there was blood,
signs of a struggle.

36:15.403 --> 36:17.571
Hughes even left a painting
of his on the wall this time.

36:17.639 --> 36:19.739
It's the same signature
and it's definitely made of blood,

36:19.807 --> 36:23.410
which got me thinking
about Maeve's stalker.

36:23.478 --> 36:26.146
If this guy's a tortured artist
searching for approval,

36:26.214 --> 36:28.848
in his mind there may be
only one way to get it.

36:28.916 --> 36:30.517
Suicide.

36:30.585 --> 36:33.252
Thanks, Reid.

36:41.995 --> 36:45.565
I put my heart and my soul
into those paintings.

36:50.069 --> 36:51.436
You're going to get
a first-hand look

36:51.504 --> 36:54.472
at what I'm capable
of creating.

36:57.976 --> 36:59.344
Bryan Hughes, FBI.

36:59.412 --> 37:02.314
No! I have to make her see.

37:03.248 --> 37:05.583
Hotch:
Put down the knife.

37:09.053 --> 37:11.488
Bryan, I understand.

37:11.556 --> 37:12.989
No, you don't.

37:13.057 --> 37:15.492
How could you possibly
understand?

37:15.560 --> 37:17.794
Because I've seen
your work.

37:17.862 --> 37:19.863
And I know you may not
be appreciated now,

37:19.931 --> 37:22.132
but I promise you,
if you put down the knife,

37:22.200 --> 37:24.801
I will make sure that
people see your art,

37:24.869 --> 37:27.537
and no one will be
able to ignore it.

37:27.605 --> 37:29.840
It's all I want.
I deserve that.

37:29.907 --> 37:34.510
Then put down the knife,
and let's figure this out.

37:43.686 --> 37:47.689
You know how many paintings
van Gogh sold before he died?

37:47.758 --> 37:49.358
Bryan, don't do it.

37:50.894 --> 37:52.994
Two.

37:53.963 --> 37:56.064
He sold two.

37:56.132 --> 37:58.466
Don't make us do this.

38:05.474 --> 38:06.975
I gotta make you see me.

38:15.016 --> 38:16.016
Get the EMTs upstairs.

38:16.084 --> 38:18.685
We've got another body
over here.

38:20.822 --> 38:22.823
[Gasping]

38:57.722 --> 39:01.358
Well, I counted 5 baskets.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.660
7, but I think
Ms. Cavanaugh next door

39:03.728 --> 39:05.395
may have taken a couple.

39:06.698 --> 39:09.366
I'm really sorry
if I've been kind of...

39:09.434 --> 39:13.303
Spence. You don't...

39:13.370 --> 39:14.770
Kid.

39:14.839 --> 39:17.240
I didn't mean for you
to come all the way out there.

39:17.308 --> 39:19.042
I know.

39:19.109 --> 39:22.778
Listen, if you need
anything at all,

39:22.847 --> 39:24.613
you just have to ask.

39:25.582 --> 39:27.283
Actually, if you guys
don't mind,

39:27.351 --> 39:30.819
I could use some help
with something.

39:30.887 --> 39:32.620
Name it.

41:17.956 --> 41:21.657
Reid: "Sometimes the hardest
part isn't letting go,

41:21.724 --> 41:25.361
but rather, learning
to start over."
