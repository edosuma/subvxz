You should tell him I say hello.

Where did you ﬁnd this?

Patricia Swann visited me today.

20:56.964 --> 21:00.548
Apparently I made it while I was still
learning my way around a paintbrush.

21:00.718 --> 21:04.711
Well, if you're looking for some validation
of your artistic talent as a child...

21:04.889 --> 21:06.004
...it's late, isn't it?

21:06.432 --> 21:09.390
Patricia told me
it's the symbol for Veritas...

21:09.560 --> 21:12.302
...but she's not sharing the whole story.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.764
It's the misguided musings
of a few youthful idealists...

21:15.942 --> 21:17.807
...with money and time on their hands.

21:17.985 --> 21:21.352
We took ourselves much too seriously,
I'm embarrassed to say.

What secret was so important that you
and your friends built a group around it?

21:25.660 --> 21:29.323
Think about it, Lex. Skull and Bones,
Scroll and Key, the Delphic.

21:29.497 --> 21:32.284
The rich have secret societies,
the others have poker nights.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.621
Well, it seems life dealt
your charter members a poor hand.

Besides you, everyone else is dead.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.630
Why did you kill them?

21:42.510 --> 21:45.343
Will you give it a rest, Lex.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.219
Let the whole business rest in peace.

Yeah. He was just here.

on a short leash.

onto a steep hill.

It'll take us a while to climb up.

I'd climb Mount Everest.

Yes, sir, and so is the lab.
