08:51.529 --> 08:52.730
my traveler's checks,

08:52.731 --> 08:53.998
my <i>X-Men</i> number one

08:53.999 --> 08:55.466
in near-mint condition,

08:55.467 --> 08:56.668
my Beanie Babies.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.636
( sobbing ):
I'm tapped out.

08:58.637 --> 09:01.272
Well, I'd really like
to work with you here.

09:01.273 --> 09:02.907
Do you own any property?

09:02.908 --> 09:04.175
Hmm?

09:04.176 --> 09:06.110
This brown one
would be good.

09:06.111 --> 09:09.013
Or maybe this beige one.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.849
I like the beige one.

09:11.850 --> 09:13.250
It brings out
your immaturity.

09:13.251 --> 09:14.519
Immature?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.721
My life is over, people!

09:16.722 --> 09:18.423
( sobbing )

09:21.893 --> 09:23.427
Where's your medallion, Salem?

09:23.428 --> 09:25.463
Diamond Dave said
he could melt it down

09:25.464 --> 09:27.731
and sell the gold
to a dentist.

09:27.732 --> 09:29.867
Tell me you didn't play him.

09:29.868 --> 09:32.403
Kind of, sort of. And I
got into a little trouble.

09:32.404 --> 09:35.239
See, I kind of bet something
that wasn't mine to bet.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.607
More like...

09:36.608 --> 09:37.808
Well, actually,
it was yours.

09:37.809 --> 09:39.176
Kind of a big thing.

09:39.177 --> 09:41.846
Please tell me
you didn't bet the house.

09:41.847 --> 09:42.880
How do I say this?

09:42.881 --> 09:45.683
Whoo, boy,
I'm feeling woozy.

09:45.684 --> 09:46.617
Okay.

09:46.618 --> 09:48.987
Did you bet this house?

09:48.988 --> 09:50.120
Well, no.

09:50.121 --> 09:52.423
Actually, I bet...

09:54.692 --> 09:56.426
...you.

09:56.427 --> 09:59.397
They seemed to take that
pretty well.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.672
Did you guys
paint the piano?

10:07.673 --> 10:10.775
Ah, ladies, welcome
to the gaming floor.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.644
Diamond Dave.

10:12.645 --> 10:13.611
You mean,
Salem bet <i>us?</i>

10:13.612 --> 10:14.845
And lost?

10:14.846 --> 10:15.946
Oh, this is absurd.

10:15.947 --> 10:17.081
Come on, let's get out of here.

10:19.584 --> 10:21.085
Your magic's
no good here,

10:21.086 --> 10:22.720
and neither
is your credit.

10:22.721 --> 10:23.888
I won you
fair and square

10:23.889 --> 10:25.023
in a game
of Texas hold'em.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.457
A game sanctioned
by the Other Realm

10:26.458 --> 10:28.125
Bureau of Gaming and Fishing.

10:28.126 --> 10:29.394
For the next 20 years,

10:29.395 --> 10:31.462
you'll be doing
menial jobs for me.

10:31.463 --> 10:32.596
C.K.:
And Diamond Dave

10:32.597 --> 10:35.365
likes things done
the mortal way.

10:35.366 --> 10:36.467
You...

10:36.468 --> 10:38.469
will be my new cook.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.540
That cat is going
straight to the pound.

10:44.777 --> 10:48.445
And you are my new...

10:48.446 --> 10:49.346
maid!

10:51.183 --> 10:53.417
That cat is going straight
to a violin factory.

10:53.418 --> 10:55.052
And you--

10:55.053 --> 10:57.154
You will be my new
personal assistant.

10:57.155 --> 10:58.289
Wait!

10:58.290 --> 10:59.924
You can't keep us here.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.959
I have a life and--
And a boyfriend, and--

11:01.960 --> 11:05.129
Did I happen to mention the job
includes driving my Porsche?

11:05.130 --> 11:05.963
Whoo-hoo!

11:07.632 --> 11:08.632
HILDA:
No fair.

11:08.633 --> 11:10.601
She got a cute uniform.

11:10.602 --> 11:12.603
It's my business
to be popular.

11:12.604 --> 11:14.605
Ah, you ladies are
now part of that formula,

11:14.606 --> 11:17.074
and I like my ladies
upbeat and zesty.

11:17.075 --> 11:19.677
We are cleaning,
and we are smiling.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.245
I'd like to start
with a light meal:

11:21.246 --> 11:23.213
burnt bacon, peanut butter,
four bananas,

11:23.214 --> 11:24.849
hand-mashed in a bowl.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.451
Would you like a spoon
or a straw with that?

11:27.452 --> 11:29.820
In the grotto,
and today, cookie.

11:32.023 --> 11:32.956
Everybody heard that:

11:32.957 --> 11:34.658
I get to drive a Porsche, right?

11:34.659 --> 11:36.126
He called me "cookie."

11:36.127 --> 11:37.595
We've got to find
a way out,

11:37.596 --> 11:39.797
and, of course,
Salem will help.

11:39.798 --> 11:41.999
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

11:42.000 --> 11:43.033
Oof!

11:43.034 --> 11:44.469
I'm okay!

11:45.704 --> 11:48.906
That was so much fun.

11:48.907 --> 11:51.041
Eh, not bad for my first time
driving stick, huh?

11:51.042 --> 11:53.277
I'll be recovering in the grotto
until the guests arrive,

11:53.278 --> 11:55.813
and what do we say, Hilda,
when I come home?

11:55.814 --> 11:57.715
( in cockney accent ):
Evenin', governor.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.417
Needs work.

11:59.418 --> 12:01.586
Diamond Dave wasn't kidding
when he said he was popular.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.120
It's like driving
around with the pope.

12:03.121 --> 12:04.922
People fawning
all over you

12:04.923 --> 12:06.323
is very overrated.

12:06.324 --> 12:08.059
I don't need that kind
of attention,

12:08.060 --> 12:10.494
as I pointed out
on my website.

12:10.495 --> 12:12.096
He's starting
to remind me of Libby.

12:12.097 --> 12:13.230
I'm starting to think

12:13.231 --> 12:15.232
that money is the root
of all popularity.

12:15.233 --> 12:16.433
Don't forget fear.

12:16.434 --> 12:18.069
Well, Libby has that too.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.570
Sabrina, money is just
a shortcut to popularity,

12:20.571 --> 12:22.039
and shortcuts never work.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.241
Well, they do
for Diamond Dave.

12:24.809 --> 12:26.010
( huffs )

12:26.011 --> 12:27.411
You look awful.
What's the matter?

12:27.412 --> 12:29.179
Oh, something to do
with chitlins.

12:29.180 --> 12:32.349
Look, I have a plan
to get us out of here.

12:32.350 --> 12:35.352
I want each of you to get me two
of the ingredients on this list.

12:35.353 --> 12:36.887
But we can't use magic.

12:36.888 --> 12:38.222
Our fingers
may have crapped out,

12:38.223 --> 12:40.024
but we can make
a sleeping potion,

12:40.025 --> 12:42.960
and I'll mix it into Diamond
Dave's next culinary atrocity.

12:42.961 --> 12:44.495
If it works,
we can make a break for it

12:44.496 --> 12:46.030
while he and C.K.
are zonked out.

12:46.031 --> 12:47.364
I am so in.

12:47.365 --> 12:49.166
Did I mention
I'm driving a Porsche?

12:50.568 --> 12:52.136
Okay, I'm in too.

12:52.137 --> 12:53.304
( <i>upbeat action theme playing</i> )

12:53.305 --> 12:54.504
ZELDA ( voice-over ):

12:58.010 --> 12:59.176

13:01.079 --> 13:03.213

<i>Try not to damage the coat</i>

13:21.266 --> 13:24.535
<i>And top it off with a little</i>
<i>alcohol for flavor.</i>

13:25.971 --> 13:28.171
Toss in a little more
of that comb cleaner.

13:31.776 --> 13:34.412
One sip of this,
and he'll be out for a week.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.313
And I haven't added
the nose hairs yet.

13:36.314 --> 13:38.316
( all cackle )

13:38.317 --> 13:39.417
Shh.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.884
It's only natural
to get carried away

13:40.885 --> 13:42.386
when we're gathered
over a cauldron.

13:42.387 --> 13:45.322
But remember, this potion
is our last resort.

13:45.323 --> 13:47.825
I'm still hoping
Salem will save us.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.628
( as cowboy ):
Whoo, doggie!

13:50.629 --> 13:52.930
Yee-ha!

13:52.931 --> 13:54.799
( sobbing )

13:54.800 --> 13:56.767
Okay, I've had my fun.

13:56.768 --> 13:59.003
Now I've got a family to save.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.037
( doorbell rings )

14:00.038 --> 14:02.239
Ooh, my wontons.

14:03.675 --> 14:06.143
I have to say, you gals
are doing a stellar job.

14:06.144 --> 14:07.177
C.K., if I were you,

14:07.178 --> 14:08.913
I would definitely
be hearing footsteps.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.480
That's a good one,
double D.

14:10.481 --> 14:12.016
( forced laughter )

14:12.017 --> 14:14.852
Okay, who's ready
for some tongue,

14:14.853 --> 14:17.988
mini-marshmallow
and yam soup?

14:17.989 --> 14:19.457
Just like Mama
used to make.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.425
Zelda, the grub
has been magnifico,

14:21.426 --> 14:23.461
but, you know, I've been
thinking of making Hilda

14:23.462 --> 14:25.362
my official food taster.

14:25.363 --> 14:27.631
What? And deprive you?

14:27.632 --> 14:29.733
Well, you know, I've been
so hot at the tables recently,

14:29.734 --> 14:31.868
you never know who might be
messing with my lucky meals,

14:31.869 --> 14:33.203
and we might as well start

14:33.204 --> 14:35.439
with a steaming
bowl of tongue.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.840
But C.K. has seniority.

14:36.841 --> 14:38.275
Yeah, he should
have the honor.

14:38.276 --> 14:40.411
That bum? I give him a gift
every day I don't can him.

14:40.412 --> 14:43.180
I think I'm starting to see
a pattern in your humor.

14:43.181 --> 14:44.148
Here.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.751
You've earned it,
Hilda.

14:48.853 --> 14:50.888
Go ahead, unless there's
something wrong with it.

14:50.889 --> 14:51.889

14:51.890 --> 14:53.557
( all laugh )

14:53.558 --> 14:54.925
Oh, you know what?
It's chunky style.

14:54.926 --> 14:56.026
That's my favorite.

14:56.027 --> 14:57.360
DAVE:
A-ha.

14:57.361 --> 14:58.729
( crunching )

15:01.232 --> 15:03.233
I find that
highly suspicious.

15:03.234 --> 15:05.136
She's tired.

15:05.137 --> 15:06.904
She's been working
really hard.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.104
Yeah.

15:08.105 --> 15:09.907
Don't let us
interrupt your dinner.

15:09.908 --> 15:11.809
You witches
dosed my dinner.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.878
Does this mean I get
to cook for you again?

15:14.879 --> 15:16.313
Nice try, ladies.

15:16.314 --> 15:17.681
I hope you enjoy your new job:

15:17.682 --> 15:19.416
manning the septic tank.

15:20.485 --> 15:23.487
I still get to drive
the Porsche, right?

15:23.488 --> 15:25.255
( snoring )

15:25.256 --> 15:26.256
Aah!

15:26.257 --> 15:27.257
What?

15:27.258 --> 15:28.792
Oh, man!

15:28.793 --> 15:30.627
I dreamt I was out of food.

15:30.628 --> 15:34.131
Whoo! Check out
all the dead soldiers.

15:34.132 --> 15:35.299
Wait a minute.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.933
I am out of food.

15:36.934 --> 15:39.336
Now I've really
gotta save them!

15:40.838 --> 15:43.807
Ooh, easy on the bunion,
princess.

15:43.808 --> 15:45.642
And when you're done,
use the clear nail polish.

15:45.643 --> 15:47.778
Not that frosty stuff
you used last time.

15:47.779 --> 15:50.647
It's called Lady Meringue.

15:50.648 --> 15:52.349
Can I get you anything?

15:52.350 --> 15:53.717
How about a friend
to watch my back?

15:53.718 --> 15:56.053
Double D, I said I was sorry
about the food thing.

15:56.054 --> 15:58.022
"The food thing?" You mean
the attempt to poison me?

15:58.023 --> 16:00.257
Why would I wanna hurt you?
You're my oldest friend.

16:00.258 --> 16:01.458
He's your oldest friend?

16:01.459 --> 16:03.728
We went to school together.
I gave him a kidney.

16:03.729 --> 16:04.828
He gave you a kidney?

16:04.829 --> 16:06.731
What did I say when we signed
the release forms?

16:06.732 --> 16:07.765
No guilt trips.

16:07.766 --> 16:08.899
Come on, Dave.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.467
You're fired.
But, Dave--

16:10.468 --> 16:11.769
You heard me. Now mush.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.771
If that's the way
you want it.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.606
But just remember this:
the only reason

16:15.607 --> 16:16.974
you aren't alone
in this house

16:16.975 --> 16:18.942
is because you're good
with a deck of cards.

16:18.943 --> 16:21.845
As a human being,
you're strictly an amateur.

16:21.846 --> 16:23.748
Yeah, well, you know what?
That kidney you gave me

16:23.749 --> 16:24.982
isn't exactly a Cadillac.

16:26.084 --> 16:27.450
How could you do that to C.K.?

16:27.451 --> 16:29.753
I mean, he may be a kiss-up
with no personality,

16:29.754 --> 16:30.921
but he's your friend.

16:30.922 --> 16:32.790
Sabrina, as long
as I have money,

16:32.791 --> 16:34.024
I'll have friends.

16:34.025 --> 16:35.960
But they aren't real friends.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.727
And you're not
really a butler,

16:37.728 --> 16:39.729
but you'll be doing
C.K.'s job from now on.

16:39.730 --> 16:41.098
( doorbell rings )

16:41.099 --> 16:43.333
You can start
by answering the doorbell.

16:43.334 --> 16:44.267
Ugh.

16:45.770 --> 16:46.904
( sighs )

16:48.139 --> 16:49.206
Diamond Dave?

16:49.207 --> 16:50.841
Allow me to introduce

16:50.842 --> 16:55.479
Mr. Catchow, an incredibly
irresponsible Asian gambler.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.149
( in Chinese accent ):
Me crazy for Pai Gow.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.050
( creaking )

17:00.051 --> 17:01.152
( grunting )

17:01.153 --> 17:02.119
Aah!

17:02.120 --> 17:03.220
( shattering )

17:03.221 --> 17:04.588
What was that?

17:04.589 --> 17:06.857
Oh, look, a putty tat.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.726
The potion
still hasn't worn off.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.964
What exactly was your plan?

17:13.964 --> 17:16.532
Um, this is
pretty much it.

17:16.534 --> 17:17.834
I figured
once I got inside,

17:17.835 --> 17:19.569
I'd get inspired.

17:19.569 --> 17:21.172
Perfect.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.606
Now you're all mine.

17:22.607 --> 17:24.308
And I got myself
a new shoe buffer.

17:24.309 --> 17:25.776
( sobbing )

17:25.777 --> 17:27.877
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
This is hugely unfair.

17:27.878 --> 17:29.546
We can't be held
responsible for anything

17:29.547 --> 17:32.216
that a professional gambler
wins from a common house pet.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.952
A house pet who's rated
by Caesar's Palace.

17:34.953 --> 17:37.087
How about a game,
just you and me?

17:37.088 --> 17:38.889
If I win,
we all get to go home.

17:38.890 --> 17:40.490
And if you lose?

17:40.491 --> 17:43.293
We'll stay for 100 years
and clean your garage.

17:43.294 --> 17:45.162
Sabrina, no, we're witches.

17:45.163 --> 17:47.331
Twenty years is a drop
in the bucket to us.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.867
It may take Hilda that long
to straighten up.

17:49.868 --> 17:52.203
You look so familiar to me.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.905
Sit like a lady, dear.

17:54.906 --> 17:56.073
Sabrina,

17:56.074 --> 17:58.675
I'll see your bet,
and raise you.

17:58.676 --> 18:01.345
If I win, you all
stay here with me...

18:01.346 --> 18:02.279
forever.

18:03.114 --> 18:04.047
Done.

18:04.048 --> 18:04.981
Poker?

18:04.982 --> 18:07.384
No. My game.

18:07.385 --> 18:09.019
DAVE:
Chutes and Ladders?

18:09.020 --> 18:10.887
My game, my rules.

18:12.022 --> 18:13.590
Only if I get to be Butch.

18:13.591 --> 18:15.392
Done.

18:15.393 --> 18:17.994
...four, five, six.

18:17.995 --> 18:19.696
One, two-- shoot.

18:19.697 --> 18:21.064
A chute.

18:21.065 --> 18:22.833
I haven't lost this game
since kindergarten.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.234
I ain't gonna start now.

18:28.573 --> 18:30.507
We did say
two out of three, right?

18:30.508 --> 18:32.009
I am so close
to the winner's circle

18:32.010 --> 18:34.211
I can smell the champagne.

18:34.212 --> 18:36.580
Sabrina, that has to be
your last chute.

18:36.581 --> 18:38.582
It's not like I'm doing this
on purpose, Aunt Zelda.

18:40.017 --> 18:41.185
Yes!

18:41.186 --> 18:43.520
Six sweet steps to victory.

18:43.521 --> 18:45.356
Oh, the glory of it all.

18:45.357 --> 18:46.457
I can't believe it.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.191
This is my game!

18:48.192 --> 18:49.492
Not anymore, kid.

18:49.493 --> 18:50.928
It's all right, Sabrina.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.295
You played great.

18:52.296 --> 18:54.164
And it's not like
forever lasts--

18:54.165 --> 18:56.499
Oh, dear lord, forever.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.368
Is the room spinning

18:58.369 --> 18:59.903
or is it me?

18:59.904 --> 19:01.671
She's having a reaction
to the potion.

19:01.672 --> 19:03.072
Hey, Saint Vitus' dance,

19:03.073 --> 19:05.242
take it outside.

19:05.243 --> 19:08.045
You know what, big shot?

19:08.046 --> 19:11.215
I spit in your grotto.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.817
I think we need to put some
coffee on for Aunt Tipsy.

19:13.818 --> 19:16.120
You know what?
I never liked you,

19:16.121 --> 19:17.855
and your cleft
really bugs me.

19:18.956 --> 19:21.325
Oh! Oh, dear.
Oh, this is bad.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.726
This is very bad.

19:22.727 --> 19:24.894
I'm so sorry, Diamond--

19:24.895 --> 19:27.297
Is it me, or is Diamond Dave
slumped over the table breathing

19:27.298 --> 19:28.932
yet clearly unconscious?

19:28.933 --> 19:31.034
That's a pretty fair
assessment.

19:31.035 --> 19:32.269
Hey!

19:32.270 --> 19:34.505
Look, he had extra dice
up his sleeve,

19:34.506 --> 19:35.939
and it's all sixes.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.674
No wonder he always won.

19:37.675 --> 19:38.875
Let's get out of here.

19:38.876 --> 19:40.643
SALEM:
He must have cheated
with me too.

19:40.644 --> 19:41.912
I was robbed!

19:41.913 --> 19:43.747
I should at least get
the Leroy Neiman painting

19:43.748 --> 19:45.348
as compensation.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.919
Ow! My head!

19:48.920 --> 19:51.421
I said
I was super-sorry.

19:51.422 --> 19:54.424
If I say it again,
will you save my racing forms?

19:54.425 --> 19:56.160
No.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.128
You're not even allowed
to watch <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

19:58.129 --> 19:59.129
( sobs )

19:59.130 --> 20:00.597
Morning. I'm late.
I promise to eat

20:00.598 --> 20:02.065
all the unbruised parts
on the bus.

20:02.066 --> 20:03.133
Are you gonna be okay

20:03.134 --> 20:05.068
about taking the bus
to the field trip?

20:05.069 --> 20:07.170
Yeah, I'll be fine.

20:07.171 --> 20:08.772
You know, after a week
at Diamond Dave's,

20:08.773 --> 20:10.140
I can honestly say

20:10.141 --> 20:11.809
that I do not want
to be like Libby.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.977
It's not money
that makes you happy.

20:13.978 --> 20:15.145
It's friends like Harvey,

20:15.146 --> 20:17.047
who ride the stupid
loser bus with you.

20:17.048 --> 20:19.216
Oh, we're so glad
you see that.

20:19.217 --> 20:20.317
Aren't we, Hilda?

20:20.318 --> 20:22.352
Mmm. Ow!

20:22.353 --> 20:24.354
One more thing
before you go.

20:24.355 --> 20:25.655
You're killing me here.

20:25.656 --> 20:27.390
Oh, I think you'll
make it on time.

20:27.391 --> 20:29.359
We decided you deserved
a little reward

20:29.360 --> 20:31.028
for having
such a good attitude.

20:31.029 --> 20:32.796
But just for today.

20:32.797 --> 20:35.766
( engine revs )

20:38.169 --> 20:40.370
What are you,
a secret agent or something?

20:40.371 --> 20:41.305
Hop in.

20:41.306 --> 20:44.374
Hey, check out Sabrina's ride.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.942
Where did you get that?

20:45.943 --> 20:47.711
Oh, my aunt's wagon broke down.

20:47.712 --> 20:48.979
This is a loaner.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.714
I'd offer rides,
but it's a two-seater.

20:53.284 --> 20:54.451
Hey, where are you going?

20:54.452 --> 20:55.852
I think the bus is coming.

20:55.853 --> 20:57.321
If I'm not gonna
ride in a Porsche,

20:57.322 --> 20:58.555
what's the difference?

20:58.556 --> 21:00.623
But I have an opening...

21:00.624 --> 21:03.326
next to an air bag.

21:03.327 --> 21:04.628
Come back!

21:04.629 --> 21:07.431
We'll try not to gun it when we
pass you on the thruway.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.300
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

21:13.838 --> 21:15.072
Any threes?

21:15.073 --> 21:16.706
Go fish.

21:16.707 --> 21:18.174
Any fives?

21:18.175 --> 21:20.944
Yes, and I had my heart set
on that new can of tennis balls.

21:20.945 --> 21:22.712
Uh, read 'em and weep.

21:22.713 --> 21:24.314
Pay the lady.
Ow.

21:24.315 --> 21:25.449
My wife's gonna kill me.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.716
Hey, I won fair and square,

21:26.717 --> 21:28.018
and I'm taking my winnings.

21:28.019 --> 21:29.887
Oh. Huh. Huh.

21:29.888 --> 21:30.954
And buying you all

21:30.955 --> 21:32.289
rawhide treats.

21:32.290 --> 21:33.957
God bless this woman.

21:33.958 --> 21:35.859
All right!

21:35.860 --> 21:37.594
Okay, settle down.
