00:11.625 --> 00:13.458
The Senate named your uncle Regent,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.750
and he's named Tihomir his Viceroy.

00:16.833 --> 00:17.791
My father?

00:17.875 --> 00:19.541
Alive but sick.

00:19.625 --> 00:20.583
Too sick.

00:21.375 --> 00:23.666
His secret is not a secret anymore.

00:24.750 --> 00:25.583
It gets worse.

00:26.583 --> 00:30.041
The Coriel'Tauvi have launched
an offensive across the frontier,

00:30.125 --> 00:32.750
claiming we're responsible
for the falling sky.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.083
Claiming we attacked Mene herself.

00:35.958 --> 00:37.541
I need to see my father.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.500
How many is that?

01:42.125 --> 01:43.916
Wait. Don't answer.

01:45.125 --> 01:48.458
I know. It's just, It's the same result.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.416
It's always the same,

01:50.500 --> 01:53.875
no matter when or where
in the orbital path the moon explodes.

01:53.958 --> 01:55.333
Everything dies.

01:55.416 --> 01:59.000
Yet, in the first world,
that's not what happened.

01:59.083 --> 02:03.541
The destruction of the moon
changed everything, but life went on.

02:03.625 --> 02:09.333
Removing the second moon
stabilized the Mad Moon's orbit.

02:09.416 --> 02:13.500
It allowed the prison to hold far longer
than it would in the first world.

02:13.583 --> 02:15.166
But-- But what if…

02:20.291 --> 02:21.208
Here.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.458
Of course.

02:26.416 --> 02:28.041
It was a shield.

02:28.875 --> 02:34.125
When the end came,
its gravity protected the world below.

02:34.875 --> 02:39.208
Mene. Mother. What did that do to you?

03:00.666 --> 03:01.916
Run.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.291
What the…

03:15.625 --> 03:17.541
<i>The Coriel'Tauvi are turning tail.</i>

03:17.625 --> 03:20.208
The river is the demarcation point
for the old boundaries.

03:20.291 --> 03:23.291
The bulk of their forces will have
crossed back over it by nightfall.

03:23.375 --> 03:27.791
Only to attack again once the moon rises.
It's always the same.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.875
The day is ours, the night is theirs.

03:30.958 --> 03:31.958
No.

03:32.041 --> 03:34.208
This is different. This is new.

03:34.708 --> 03:36.458
It's happening across the frontier.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.708
I'll fly more reconnaissance
over their forward positions.

03:39.791 --> 03:43.666
Perhaps I can work out their intentions
and encourage them along.

03:46.541 --> 03:47.750
For the Slayer.

03:49.666 --> 03:50.541
Wait.

03:51.291 --> 03:55.166
It's from General Drysi,
commander of the Principality Army.

03:55.875 --> 03:57.250
She wants to meet.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.166
An offer of parley.

04:00.208 --> 04:01.083
I need to think.

04:03.666 --> 04:05.833
Your uncle sent the regular army
to the front,

04:05.916 --> 04:07.958
along with most of the Praetorian Guard.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.291
Tihomir's private legion remained to…

04:11.541 --> 04:13.875
protect the Imperial City.

04:13.958 --> 04:15.541
"Protect" it.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.333
Dearest niece.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.250
Welcome home.

04:25.166 --> 04:26.541
After the Principality attack,

04:26.625 --> 04:29.875
we deployed the Slayer
and inflicted substantial losses.

04:29.958 --> 04:32.166
We're told that their general
offered a parley.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.125
So, the battle nears its end?

04:34.208 --> 04:37.000
Their withdrawal smells of a trap.

04:37.083 --> 04:41.208
My soldiers are already mobilizing
for the counter-offensive.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.708
Our soldiers.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.541
My soldiers.

04:44.625 --> 04:47.083
Let's not quibble over semantics.

04:47.166 --> 04:50.000
The situation on the border
is not what it seems.

04:50.083 --> 04:53.416
I believe the elves withdrew
because they learned what I know.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.916
What threatens us is not one another
but something greater.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.875
Lina will accept parley
and, if possible, negotiate an armistice.

05:00.958 --> 05:04.416
Princess, while you were off
on your little adventure,

05:04.500 --> 05:08.041
Imperium blood was shed. Lives were lost.

05:08.125 --> 05:13.416
You abandon your station in a time of war,
return with these unhelpful notions,

05:13.500 --> 05:16.750
and dare to think
you know what's best for all of us?

05:16.833 --> 05:19.208
You're clearly as mad as my poor brother.

05:19.958 --> 05:21.375
Council is concluded.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.708
She doesn't understand.

05:27.333 --> 05:30.458
Never had
so many Dragon Knights in here.

05:30.541 --> 05:35.041
What gods awful monstrosity
could need so many brave souls?

05:35.125 --> 05:37.708
We're going south.
We found an Eldwurm in Barrowhaven.

05:37.791 --> 05:40.166
-"An old worm?" Is that dangerous?

05:40.250 --> 05:43.208
Eldwurm. It's the most dangerous.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.375
Biggest kind of dragon.

05:44.458 --> 05:47.708
We're gonna kill it before it wipes out
the town and everything around it.

05:47.791 --> 05:51.833
-But we're around it.
-And you'll continue to be safe.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.375
-I could use another round.
-I'll make it two.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.458
Wha-- Another headache?

05:58.541 --> 06:00.833
I'm telling you,
I don't care how bad those nightmares are.

06:00.916 --> 06:02.000
You need to sleep.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.000
I'm fine.

06:03.791 --> 06:05.791
You look about six-feet-under fine.

06:05.875 --> 06:09.916
What happened to Kaden,
what you saw, it is horrible.

06:10.708 --> 06:11.833
Give it time.

06:12.416 --> 06:14.125
These are on the hous--

06:16.708 --> 06:18.458
Was that the old worm?

06:22.083 --> 06:24.541
There! It's coming from up there!

06:31.875 --> 06:32.916
Help!

06:33.000 --> 06:34.500
Help me.

06:34.583 --> 06:35.500
-Bram!
-Huh?

06:35.583 --> 06:36.791
Help me with this!

06:40.291 --> 06:42.375
Go. Go as fast as you can!

06:46.250 --> 06:47.625
Here. Grab my hand.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.750
What the fuck was he?

07:10.625 --> 07:11.458
Davion.

07:12.041 --> 07:13.125
I know.

07:15.541 --> 07:17.583
The Knights. The squires, they're--

07:17.666 --> 07:18.750
I know.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.250
Bram! Bram, sound off!

07:42.333 --> 07:44.083
Here.

07:53.666 --> 07:55.708
Father. I'm home.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.541
Where is my father?

08:00.416 --> 08:02.083
The Spire, Highness.

08:02.166 --> 08:05.291
Regent Shabarra ordered it
for the Emperor's safety.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.291
Sherzi, you're home.

08:19.375 --> 08:23.500
I was just thinking about the summer
we spent picking figs with Mirana.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.833
So cold today.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.208
Sing for me?

08:28.791 --> 08:30.125
It's me, Father.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.208
It's Mirana.

08:32.791 --> 08:33.666
Mirana?

08:34.458 --> 08:36.791
Yes. Send for your mother.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.250
Mother is gone.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.416
Mother has been gone for quite some time.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.333
Oh.

08:42.416 --> 08:43.458
Yes.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.541
Dead five years now.

08:46.625 --> 08:50.125
Five years, almost to the day.

08:50.208 --> 08:53.958
-Five years tomorrow.
-Yes. Yes, yes.

08:54.666 --> 08:57.208
Tomorrow, the day.

08:57.291 --> 08:59.125
I need your wisdom, Father.

08:59.708 --> 09:00.833
I need your help.

09:03.416 --> 09:07.291
I am of two worlds, two lives.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.958
And I keep mistaking one for the other.

09:10.750 --> 09:14.166
Which is fine, except a man is dead.

09:15.416 --> 09:16.625
And another man…

09:17.625 --> 09:20.791
<i>the man I loved,</i>

09:20.875 --> 09:23.583
<i>is not the man I loved at all.</i>

09:24.583 --> 09:26.791
<i>And now he hates me.</i>

09:28.083 --> 09:32.541
What is memory? What is imagined?

09:32.625 --> 09:36.958
The world is full of ghosts,
and I'm alone, Father.

09:40.041 --> 09:44.375
Would you believe me,
daughter, if I told you I understand?

09:45.416 --> 09:50.083
I see your mother everywhere.
I can't stop seeing your mother.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.333
And when she is gone,

09:52.875 --> 09:55.166
she takes the world with her.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.708
I remember the day Mother died.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.291
<i>I remember the day you both died.</i>

10:03.791 --> 10:05.708
I held your hand.

10:07.416 --> 10:09.375
<i>I was swept from the palace.</i>

10:09.458 --> 10:12.666
<i>I cried with you. I cried out your name.</i>

10:13.291 --> 10:16.000
Oh, I was barely a woman.

10:17.041 --> 10:18.875
I was just a little girl…

10:19.916 --> 10:22.458
who couldn't help her or you.

10:22.541 --> 10:24.041
Not in that world.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.291
And not in this one.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.333
Ooh.

10:28.416 --> 10:30.375
Oh, now I see.

10:30.458 --> 10:32.541
Oh, my poor girl.

10:32.625 --> 10:36.375
You've learned the most terrifying secret
in the universe.

10:37.291 --> 10:40.833
Our parents,
no matter how much they love us,

10:40.916 --> 10:43.791
cannot protect us from everything.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.583
Nor we, them.

10:45.666 --> 10:49.291
Love is not about making a perfect world,

10:49.375 --> 10:52.291
free from harm and free from pain.

10:52.375 --> 10:57.791
Love is living together
in the world as it is, come what may.

10:59.666 --> 11:02.250
Five years… tomorrow.

11:02.333 --> 11:05.041
<i>Five years… to the day.</i>

11:14.791 --> 11:16.666
I was just thinking about Mother.

11:17.458 --> 11:21.500
I was thinking
about why she chose to live a mortal life.

11:21.583 --> 11:23.458
Why she chose death.

11:23.541 --> 11:27.166
I asked her once before the end,
begged her to explain.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.541
She said,

11:28.625 --> 11:35.083
"Fi, accepting death is the only act
of true power in the universe."

11:36.958 --> 11:38.166
I stormed out.

11:38.250 --> 11:39.666
My heart was broken.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.708
I didn't understand. Not then.

11:43.416 --> 11:45.458
I think I understand now.

11:45.541 --> 11:48.750
In the end, no god, no monster,

11:48.833 --> 11:53.958
no ancient primordial entity
is more dangerous than despair.

11:54.916 --> 11:57.875
There are things you must know.

11:57.958 --> 12:00.625
I saw the book, Papa. I read it.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.541
I know what you've done and why.

12:03.166 --> 12:08.166
I should be horrified, and I am.
I should be angry, and I am.

12:08.250 --> 12:12.416
Yet, I know how I felt when Mother died,
and when I thought you might.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.833
I'd have done anything,
anything at all to make it different.

12:15.916 --> 12:18.291
But all of this, for me?

12:18.375 --> 12:23.041
A multiverse
and innumerable souls gone, for me.

12:23.125 --> 12:27.208
Except that is not what happened.
That is not all that happened.

12:27.291 --> 12:32.375
This is neither the first iteration
of a remade universe nor the second.

12:32.958 --> 12:37.125
It is not the tenth, the one hundredth,
or one-thousandth.

12:37.208 --> 12:44.041
This universe is experiment 12,403.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.166
Twelve thousand…

12:46.250 --> 12:48.750
Creation is a delicate thing.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.333
It took hundreds of iterations

12:50.416 --> 12:54.583
simply to learn
how to make a stable universe.

12:54.666 --> 12:59.125
Most died in infancy,
the stars boiling away into the void.

13:00.666 --> 13:02.250
But you, daughter.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.625
Making this world,

13:04.708 --> 13:07.541
this specific world,

13:08.041 --> 13:11.208
causality was the second lesson.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.500
And all of that for nothing.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.625
The Ancients will escape,
the Mad Moon will explode.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.791
Only now, it means the end
of all life on this planet.

13:19.875 --> 13:24.750
As I said,
our Tower will survive the holocaust.

13:24.833 --> 13:27.166
As will you. As will we.

13:27.250 --> 13:30.916
You say that
like the thought makes it better,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.750
like it's not a nightmare
I can never wake up from.

13:33.833 --> 13:36.458
Another dead world, all for me.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.458
But I have to watch this one die.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.125
Father of Fire!

13:58.791 --> 13:59.833
Welcome.

14:03.250 --> 14:07.250
My dream. I'm back in my dream.
Which means…

14:07.333 --> 14:08.666
You are not dead.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.208
Nor do you dream.

14:11.291 --> 14:16.375
In time, you will remember,
just as the ember soul remembers you.

14:16.458 --> 14:17.875
The ember soul.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.583
Reborn in you.

14:21.291 --> 14:24.291
We are he who was.

14:24.375 --> 14:28.416
You are he who is.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.250
A vessel dies, a vessel is chosen.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.708
Even now, your true nature emerges

14:34.791 --> 14:36.500
to repair the form

14:37.125 --> 14:40.333
you call "self."

14:40.416 --> 14:41.916
The ember soul.

14:42.541 --> 14:47.750
Lifetimes ago, we hid the ember soul
inside a form like yours

14:47.833 --> 14:51.166
to deceive the demon Terrorblade.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.458
The form carried us to the Eye.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.416
The princess.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.833
That's the princess.

14:59.416 --> 15:02.416
Part of us. A part of you.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.375
You feel the truth of it.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.375
I… I can feel it.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.041
And the princess…

15:11.708 --> 15:12.916
Everything she said…

15:13.500 --> 15:16.125
I need to see her. Talk to her.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.500
A futile gesture.

15:17.583 --> 15:21.250
The moon will crumble
and destroy this world.

15:21.333 --> 15:25.000
New death and rebirth are upon us all.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.875
Wait. What are you talking about?

15:32.208 --> 15:33.458
Get the hells off him!

15:54.666 --> 15:55.666
Stay back.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.916
Stay back!

15:58.000 --> 16:00.166
-What? Where is he?
-Bram.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.416
-What have you done with Davion?
-Bram.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.583
It's me.

16:04.375 --> 16:07.875
Help me kill these fucking things
before they kill anyone else.

16:16.666 --> 16:17.916
Our brothers.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.416
They just…

16:19.500 --> 16:20.916
They tore each other apart.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.458
And you.

16:22.541 --> 16:26.708
Whatever changed all those people,
did it change you too?

16:26.791 --> 16:27.791
No.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.958
It was something you'll like even less.

16:33.708 --> 16:37.833
I never stopped to think,
to step outside myself,

16:37.916 --> 16:41.791
to see this… this world as it truly is.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.958
I was so hells-bent on reshaping it
to suit me and…

16:47.125 --> 16:50.375
Gods. Terrorblade. The Invoker.

16:51.333 --> 16:52.791
How am I so different?

16:54.625 --> 16:55.916
I owe you more.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.458
I owe you better.

16:59.416 --> 17:02.041
And you will have it, I swear.

17:05.916 --> 17:09.541
Forgive me, Highness.
I have orders from Regent Shabarra.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.875
Your father needs you most right now.
You're to stay by his side.

17:12.958 --> 17:16.875
My uncle doesn't have the authority
to give you that order.

17:16.958 --> 17:19.375
Shabarra says you're mad.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.875
He says exposure to that red rock

17:21.958 --> 17:25.458
and the Oracle whispering in your ear
have changed you.

17:25.541 --> 17:27.041
And the Legati agree.

17:27.125 --> 17:29.291
Your uncle thinks the Senate will, too.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.541
And you? Do you agree?

17:33.375 --> 17:34.500
Don't fight this.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.000
He will use it against you.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.083
He'll make things worse for you.

17:39.166 --> 17:43.250
You are captain of the Praetorian Guard.
The Guard serves our family.

17:43.333 --> 17:46.916
If you follow the Regent's order,
it can only be because you agree.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.375
You entered the Oracle's temple one person
and came out another, speaking nonsense.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.416
You-- You disappeared without explanation.

17:54.500 --> 17:59.625
I-- I had to hunt across hundreds of spans
of hostile territory to bring you home.

18:00.625 --> 18:04.083
What do you want from me?
You have my loyalty.

18:05.041 --> 18:06.541
And my worry.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.333
I know my behavior seems erratic.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I won't even try to explain,

18:12.083 --> 18:16.250
other than to say the Oracle presented me
with a choice.

18:17.666 --> 18:21.333
And more and more,
I realize I choose badly.

18:22.375 --> 18:25.750
It doesn't need
to be a perfect world.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.458
But I am no one's prisoner.

18:30.375 --> 18:34.208
Princess, if I support you, you must stay.

18:34.916 --> 18:36.333
And you have to lead.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.833
Summon what remains of the Guard.

18:41.916 --> 18:44.125
Make way, you sorry bastards!

18:47.125 --> 18:48.416
Princess?

19:22.458 --> 19:26.083
Give me a reason.
It doesn't even have to be good.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.791
On your knees.
Beg for my forgiveness.

19:29.875 --> 19:34.166
Beg my father's forgiveness
and pray he hears you.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.208
Pray it's enough.

19:37.333 --> 19:38.541
You have two choices.

19:39.375 --> 19:42.541
The first is to take the knee.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.541
So much for not coming down
off the throne.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.375
What would your mother say?

19:47.916 --> 19:50.958
She'd say I finally understand
what she meant.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.083
If I am to become a god,

19:54.666 --> 19:57.458
I must act like a god.

19:57.541 --> 20:00.458
Guess what sort of a god I am today?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.291
All of you lot, stand down!

20:10.375 --> 20:12.208
They won't stand down.

20:12.291 --> 20:13.416
They'll fight.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.583
These soldiers belong to me.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.416
Perhaps they do, but she doesn't.

20:22.416 --> 20:24.166
Down, boys.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.375
Welcome back.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.166
You've been busy.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.958
Busier than I expected.

20:32.416 --> 20:33.916
You left the front.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.750
You accepted the offer of parley
on your own.

20:36.541 --> 20:40.125
Someone told me I'm capable
of more than just destruction.

20:42.291 --> 20:43.833
Did I wrong you in another dream?

20:44.333 --> 20:45.500
Quite the opposite.

20:47.000 --> 20:47.875
Highness?

20:49.541 --> 20:51.500
Five years to the day.

20:57.416 --> 20:58.416
Sherzi?

20:59.958 --> 21:01.625
I hear you.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.333
I hear you singing.

21:14.583 --> 21:15.625
Father!

21:19.083 --> 21:20.291
Father.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.041
Father, I'm with you.

21:24.125 --> 21:25.250
It…

21:26.500 --> 21:27.583
It's all right.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.166
Mirana.

21:31.291 --> 21:34.333
Your mother is here.

21:35.791 --> 21:38.333
Can't you hear her?

21:39.583 --> 21:45.333
She sings for both of us.

21:57.666 --> 22:00.833
Goddess, I thought it fitting
to come to you here.

22:00.916 --> 22:03.833
Somehow, this feels closer to you
than the Woods.

22:04.416 --> 22:07.916
I have spent a thousand years
defying death,

22:08.708 --> 22:13.166
pretending to be the master
of cosmic forces that shape our world.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.750
It feels empty now.

22:15.875 --> 22:19.333
More like,
a little girl's wishes than magic.

22:19.416 --> 22:20.625
I'm a fool.

22:20.708 --> 22:21.791
You feel powerless.

22:22.916 --> 22:24.083
Responsible.

22:24.166 --> 22:26.541
My father has done monstrous things.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.500
He did them out of love,

22:28.583 --> 22:32.541
but that makes them no less monstrous
or less in my name.

22:32.625 --> 22:34.291
And you would undo these things.

22:34.375 --> 22:35.791
I was like you.

22:35.875 --> 22:40.166
I thought I could fix the world
and make it look how I wanted.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.583
It doesn't work that way.

22:41.666 --> 22:44.833
I can't tell you what to do
or how to feel.

22:44.916 --> 22:46.125
But I can listen.

22:46.208 --> 22:48.541
I can ask the one question that matters.

22:48.625 --> 22:53.166
What can you live with?
What weight can your conscience bear?

22:59.166 --> 23:02.791
Wow, so… So you…
You're… You're an Eldwyrm?

23:02.875 --> 23:06.541
I'm something. It's complicated.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.583
The princess. We have to find her.

23:09.666 --> 23:11.625
I have to find her. I need to see her.

23:11.708 --> 23:14.125
Whoa, whoa, wait.
The-- The crazy one from the bar?

23:14.208 --> 23:16.375
She'll know what to do. She always does.

23:16.458 --> 23:19.333
-Do about what? Davion.
-All of it.

23:20.333 --> 23:23.916
You wanna go to the Helio Imperium.
On foot. From Haupstadt.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.333
Hey, you're a dragon. Dragons can fly.

23:27.416 --> 23:30.166
What if you became a dragon
for just a tiny little bit, and…

23:30.250 --> 23:33.625
Yeah. He… hasn't eaten in 20 years.

23:34.833 --> 23:36.833
Oh, yeah, right. Bad idea.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.166
Come, little mouse.

23:38.666 --> 23:40.291
Hey, watch who you're calling a mouse.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.625
Dragon or no dragon,
I will lay you out.
