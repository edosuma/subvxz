So, are you guys excited

01:55.507 --> 01:56.818
to come to Vuuugle's
holiday party later?

01:56.842 --> 01:58.766
Kids: Yeah!

01:58.844 --> 02:00.322
And are you excited
to open some presents?

02:00.346 --> 02:01.862
Kids: Yeah!

02:01.938 --> 02:03.530
Let me try something.

02:03.607 --> 02:04.848
Are you excited about the way
corporate America

02:04.850 --> 02:07.775
has turned the holidays
into one big money grab?

02:07.853 --> 02:08.852
Kids: Yeah!

02:08.854 --> 02:12.280
They're nine. They say "yeah."

02:12.358 --> 02:12.856
See you guys later!

02:12.858 --> 02:14.282
Kids: Yeah!

02:14.360 --> 02:15.617
(ends call)

02:15.694 --> 02:18.695
It feels so good to give back
to our community,

02:18.697 --> 02:22.866
and give those kids a holiday
party they're never gonna forget.

02:22.868 --> 02:24.551
Don't you just
love the holidays?

02:24.628 --> 02:25.864
Of course. There's a TV channel

02:25.888 --> 02:27.037
with a log on fire

02:27.039 --> 02:28.814
24 hours a day.

02:28.891 --> 02:32.209
That's the only thing you like?

02:32.211 --> 02:34.044
What about
all the Christmas miracles?

02:34.046 --> 02:36.897
It's a log! On fire!
Twenty-four seven.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.315
Poof! Miracle!

02:39.902 --> 02:42.736
Frankie, I'm serious.

02:42.812 --> 02:44.957
The holidays aren't just magical
'cause we get two weeks off of school.

02:44.981 --> 02:46.814
Magical things can happen.

02:46.850 --> 02:51.152
Paige... Sweetie...

02:51.230 --> 02:52.798
normally, your
childlike wonder's endearing,

02:52.822 --> 02:54.581
but Christmas miracles
aren't real.

02:54.658 --> 02:56.135
It's just something
parents tell their kids,

02:56.159 --> 02:58.960
like, "Your goldfish is just
taking an upside down nap."

03:06.412 --> 03:08.762
I can't believe how many
donations we're getting.

03:08.838 --> 03:11.523
I know, Tiffany.
It was so sweet of you

03:11.600 --> 03:12.933
to organize
the Vuuugle toy drive.

03:13.009 --> 03:15.085
Are you kidding?

03:15.087 --> 03:18.422
I love the feeling of inspiring
others to give.

03:18.424 --> 03:19.784
(shouting)
Put a toy in the basket!

03:21.927 --> 03:22.984
Thanks for donating!

03:25.097 --> 03:28.707
No way! A puppy
princess cowgirl doll?

03:32.104 --> 03:35.439
I mean, uh... whatever.

03:35.441 --> 03:38.533
You guys know
what I like by now.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.777
But you know what I really want
for Hanukkah this year?

03:40.779 --> 03:43.204
A kiss... from you.

03:43.282 --> 03:45.949
I'd rather get you
the action figure.

03:45.951 --> 03:46.967
It's a doll.

03:49.121 --> 03:53.123
Everybody, I have
an exciting announcement.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.883
Christmas at Vuuugle
is canceled!

03:55.961 --> 03:58.812
What? Why?

03:58.888 --> 04:02.466
Well, I started reading an inspiring
book with this great hero,

04:02.468 --> 04:04.901
named Scrooge.
He ruins Christmas.

04:07.306 --> 04:08.914
But, in the end
Scrooge learns that...

04:08.991 --> 04:11.399
Ah-ah-ah! No spoilers!

04:11.477 --> 04:16.255
Liam, we invited a bunch
of kids to the holiday party.

04:16.331 --> 04:17.923
They're huge Bizaardvark fans.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.258
They're gonna be crushed.

04:19.334 --> 04:23.487
Really? You've known me
for almost two years,

04:23.489 --> 04:26.823
and your argument
is, "What about the kids?"

04:26.825 --> 04:30.218
(laughs) Oh, Paige. Bah, humbug.

04:31.997 --> 04:33.179
He can't cancel Christmas.

04:33.256 --> 04:36.391
I know! It makes me so
mad I just want a kiss!

04:38.337 --> 04:39.436
Uh, no.

04:41.931 --> 04:44.190
I have an idea.

04:44.267 --> 04:45.191
I've taken a couple
coding classes...

04:45.268 --> 04:47.953
Hey, good for you!
STEM for life!

04:48.030 --> 04:51.123
Paige, let her finish.

04:51.199 --> 04:54.701
I think I can re-program Liam's robot to
make it so he can't see what happenin'

04:54.778 --> 04:58.130
inside Vuuugle. Then we
can still have our party!

04:58.206 --> 04:59.798
- Oh, yeah!
- Awesome!

04:59.875 --> 05:01.967
(shouting)
Put a toy in the basket, punk!

05:05.121 --> 05:07.297
Gosh, everyone is being
so generous this year.

05:11.386 --> 05:16.481
Okay. I wrote some code to
re-program Liam, but I need to find

05:16.558 --> 05:18.817
his reset button to install it
in his robot.

05:18.894 --> 05:21.320
So, get Liam in here, and talk
to him so he stands still.

05:21.396 --> 05:25.048
Okay. Get Liam in
here, distract him,

05:25.050 --> 05:26.441
we kiss... on it!

05:27.811 --> 05:29.494
Liam!

05:32.391 --> 05:34.833
What?

05:34.910 --> 05:37.336
Do you ever wonder why we never
just get together and talk?

05:37.412 --> 05:39.062
It's because I don't like you.

05:39.064 --> 05:45.402
Ahh! Uh... Well, what if we just
talk about everyday subjects?

05:45.404 --> 05:47.462
Uh, for instance,
do you like cups of dirt?

05:49.424 --> 05:51.183
Nobody likes cups of dirt.

05:51.259 --> 05:53.352
Ahh! Well, uh, do you like
having a mustache?

05:53.428 --> 05:55.854
I don't have a mustache.

05:55.931 --> 05:58.765
Uh-uh, do you like spinning
around in circles for no reason?

05:58.842 --> 06:01.360
Yes, kind of.

06:01.436 --> 06:05.364
Wheee! (Giggles)

06:05.440 --> 06:07.366
Bernie, I really need to leave.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.368
Wait! Liam...

06:09.444 --> 06:13.822
do you ever feel... lonely?

06:17.436 --> 06:19.603
Actually, Bernie, yes, I do.

06:19.605 --> 06:24.198
And perhaps, this is the one time
I'll try to connect with you.

06:24.276 --> 06:25.396
You see, just like you, I...

06:29.114 --> 06:31.506
Thank goodness!
That was about to get boring!

06:33.543 --> 06:35.301
"Just like you, I" what?

06:37.623 --> 06:39.623
That should do it.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.382
The robot
is officially re-programmed.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.569
Liam won't see anything that's
happenin' in the lounge,

06:44.646 --> 06:47.054
and we can have our party!

06:47.132 --> 06:49.633
But won't he be suspicious
that his camera is turned off?

06:49.635 --> 06:52.318
No, I re-programmed him
so all he'll see

06:52.395 --> 06:55.247
is the same footage of the lounge
over and over again on a loop.

06:55.323 --> 06:57.532
He'll think it's what's
happenin' in real time.

06:59.311 --> 07:03.738
(crying)

07:03.815 --> 07:07.259
That is obviously
very old footage.

07:07.335 --> 07:09.653
It was taken this morning.

07:09.655 --> 07:12.656
(to himself)
Oh, no! She caught you.

07:12.658 --> 07:15.008
Say something cool.

07:15.084 --> 07:17.427
Well, when I cried...
I was thinkin' about you.

07:25.187 --> 07:28.505
It is so cool your fans brought
donations for the toy drive.

07:28.507 --> 07:32.525
What can I say? Some people
just have the holiday spirit.

07:32.602 --> 07:35.361
And some people were just using
that hand to pick their nose.

07:40.519 --> 07:41.626
Hey! Horse Face!

07:41.703 --> 07:44.963
You haven't donated yet!

07:45.040 --> 07:46.965
Oh I can run, too!

07:49.711 --> 07:51.544
When do we get
to eat the Christmas cookies?

07:51.621 --> 07:54.973
Ramona, we told you, those are
for the end of the party.

07:55.050 --> 07:55.882
- You understand?
- Yes.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.717
Okay.

07:57.794 --> 07:59.978
When do we get to eat
the Christmas cookies?

08:00.055 --> 08:04.966
I'm telling you right now
I'm gonna lose it on this kid.

08:05.043 --> 08:07.468
Attention, everyone!

08:07.546 --> 08:11.715
Not only did I re-program the
robot, I gave him a makeover.

08:11.717 --> 08:13.733
Now, he's a holly-jolly
Santa robot.

08:13.810 --> 08:16.995
Complete with arms
for handin' out presents.

08:17.072 --> 08:19.222
(whirring noise)

08:19.224 --> 08:21.816
All: Ooh.

08:21.893 --> 08:23.910
A candy cane dispenser.

08:25.897 --> 08:28.565
All: Ooh!

08:28.567 --> 08:29.824
And an ornament launcher

08:29.901 --> 08:32.627
for those hard-to-reach
branches of the tree.

08:36.575 --> 08:39.667
- All but Bernie: Ahh!
- Ooh!

08:39.745 --> 08:41.911
Aw, you guys
switched it up on me.

08:41.913 --> 08:45.339
Christmas
is officially uncanceled.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.417
You're welcome.

08:49.254 --> 08:52.513
All right.
Let's bring out Party Bernie.

08:52.591 --> 08:53.923
Time to practice my cool lean.

08:53.925 --> 08:56.183
(beeping)

08:56.261 --> 08:57.927
Ahh!
I deleted some of Amelia's code!

08:57.929 --> 09:01.614
Okay. Don't panic.

09:01.691 --> 09:04.784
Nobody saw. Just lean
back in a cool way.

09:04.861 --> 09:06.953
- (rapid beeping)
- Shoot, I deleted more!

09:09.608 --> 09:11.457
Ho, ho, ho!

09:11.534 --> 09:12.654
Yay, we're getting presents!

09:15.280 --> 09:16.379
(laughs evilly)

09:17.966 --> 09:21.876
(screams)

09:21.953 --> 09:22.953
Amelia: What's happening?

09:25.882 --> 09:27.640
I just got here!
What is happening?

09:29.461 --> 09:31.477
Destroy! Destroy!

09:31.554 --> 09:33.980
(kids screaming)

09:34.057 --> 09:35.398
(laughs evilly)

09:39.638 --> 09:41.237
- (screaming)
- (laughing evilly)

09:42.732 --> 09:46.585
We gotta get outta here!
Kids, run for the exit! Go!

09:46.661 --> 09:47.752
Locking all doors!

09:50.740 --> 09:53.258
Okay, new plan! Uh, hide! Go!

09:53.335 --> 09:55.594
(kids shouting)

09:55.670 --> 09:58.430
Everybody, just stay calm.
The robot is slow.

09:58.506 --> 10:02.158
If... If we stay out of reach,
it can't hurt us.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.828
Candy cane launcher!
(laughs evilly)

10:04.830 --> 10:05.937
(screaming)

10:06.014 --> 10:07.658
- (Paige and Frankie yelling)
- It can hurt us!

10:07.682 --> 10:11.092
Is this the kind of Christmas miracle
you were talking about, Paige?

10:11.169 --> 10:14.187
I know you're being sarcastic, but I
appreciate that you were listening.

10:15.431 --> 10:16.840
Ahh!

10:16.842 --> 10:18.099
(gasp) Peter!

10:18.176 --> 10:19.359
- Henry.
- Henry!

10:21.847 --> 10:23.247
Whatever your name is,
come with me.

10:24.607 --> 10:26.791
(clicking sounds)

10:26.868 --> 10:29.461
He's out of candy canes. Now's
our chance, attack him!

10:31.690 --> 10:33.965
Switching to ornament launcher!
(laughs evilly)

10:34.042 --> 10:34.799
(smashing sounds)

10:34.876 --> 10:35.783
Ah!

10:35.861 --> 10:39.787
New plan! Don't attack him!

10:39.865 --> 10:42.215
(smashing sounds)

10:42.291 --> 10:44.458
Somebody call for help!

10:44.536 --> 10:46.052
(laughing evilly)

10:46.129 --> 10:49.372
Oh, no! The virus hacked my phone.
I think it must have control

10:49.374 --> 10:51.557
of the Vuuugle wireless network!

10:51.634 --> 10:53.059
I can't access my selfies!

10:53.136 --> 10:55.478
I can't access my selfies!

10:58.307 --> 11:01.159
I will ruin your Christmas!
(laughs evilly)

11:01.236 --> 11:04.737
(kids shouting)

11:04.814 --> 11:05.814
Whoa!

11:07.893 --> 11:13.563
(gasping for breath)

11:13.565 --> 11:15.893
Oh! That was crazy, I... I can't
believe my jolly Santa robot

11:15.917 --> 11:19.903
turned into an evil Santa robot!

11:19.905 --> 11:22.171
More like ho-ho, oh-no,
am I right?

11:25.334 --> 11:27.927
(to himself) She didn't hear.
Try it again later.

11:29.915 --> 11:35.268
Uh, are we safe? This disgusting room
looks like it should be condemned.

11:35.344 --> 11:38.604
Oh, yeah! This is your
first time in my office!

11:41.760 --> 11:43.927
Those computers!
They're the answer!

11:43.929 --> 11:47.038
They're so old they're not
connected to the network.

11:47.115 --> 11:51.951
Which means, they can't
be infected by the virus!

11:52.028 --> 11:54.620
I can use them
to get into the robot's system

11:54.697 --> 11:55.872
and stop it from attacking!

11:58.626 --> 12:02.612
So you do or you don't
want the tour?

12:02.614 --> 12:06.207
- (piercing modem sound)
- Aah! What is that?

12:06.284 --> 12:09.469
Is the Internet crying?

12:09.545 --> 12:12.046
My grandma says this is how
her computer used to work

12:12.123 --> 12:15.734
in the old days... 1997!

12:18.630 --> 12:21.965
Well, it's going too slow.
It's gonna take hours

12:21.967 --> 12:24.058
to get onto the network.

12:24.135 --> 12:27.245
Ooh, we're never gonna
get out of here alive!

12:27.322 --> 12:29.906
More like ho-ho, oh-no,
am I right?

12:31.734 --> 12:33.418
It wasn't funny the first time.

12:33.495 --> 12:35.587
(to himself) Keep it in
your back pocket, Schotz.

12:35.663 --> 12:36.663
It'll hit eventually.

12:37.832 --> 12:41.834
(knocking on door) -(screams)
The robot found us!

12:41.911 --> 12:46.839
Hey! Have you guys donated
to the toy drive yet?

12:46.916 --> 12:48.841
- Now? Now is not a good...
- Donate!

12:48.918 --> 12:50.927
- Uh...
- Here.

12:52.163 --> 12:55.756
Thanks. And be careful.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.114
There's a killer robot
out there.

12:59.337 --> 13:02.271
(kids screaming)

13:05.935 --> 13:08.495
And you said I was paranoid for
putting in all these extra locks.

13:09.772 --> 13:13.291
Hey. When are we gonna get to
eat the Christmas cookies?

13:13.368 --> 13:16.127
Ramona, now is not the time!

13:16.204 --> 13:17.832
Is anyone else in here
thinkin' about cookies?

13:17.856 --> 13:20.023
Kids: Yeah!

13:20.025 --> 13:23.117
Ah, I walked
right into that one.

13:23.194 --> 13:24.135
Ramona, I am pretty sure
there are cookies

13:24.212 --> 13:25.920
- in our recording studio!
- (gasps)

13:32.203 --> 13:33.643
Anyone else wanna talk
about cookies?

13:37.876 --> 13:40.021
(over microphone) Are the cookies
through this escape door?

13:40.045 --> 13:41.894
- No!
- Wait... Escape door?

13:41.971 --> 13:45.064
Oh, that's right! It... It
leads to the alley out back!

13:45.141 --> 13:45.882
We could use it to get out!

13:45.884 --> 13:47.308
But w... we need the key.

13:47.385 --> 13:50.069
- You still haven't picked up the key?
- Oh, this again?

13:51.556 --> 13:53.890
The key is behind the
reception desk in the lounge.

13:53.892 --> 13:57.226
But how do we get it when there
is a killer robot out there?

13:57.228 --> 13:59.987
Don't worry. I have a plan,

14:00.065 --> 14:01.625
and it's guaranteed
to keep us all safe.

14:03.492 --> 14:06.344
If we hold hands
and believe hard enough,

14:06.421 --> 14:08.170
a Christmas miracle
will save us all!

14:09.741 --> 14:14.243
All right, I want everybody
to close their eyes

14:14.245 --> 14:16.337
and picture a key
blowing in here

14:16.414 --> 14:18.356
on a magical snowflake...

14:18.433 --> 14:20.349
Okay, snowflakes,
I'm doin' this myself.

14:24.089 --> 14:26.422
I'm going out there.

14:26.424 --> 14:30.093
If I don't make it back,
tell my story.

14:30.095 --> 14:32.239
You know, the one about the time
I puked on the roller coaster

14:32.263 --> 14:34.447
with the loops?
It's a very funny story.

14:50.782 --> 14:52.965
Huh. The robot's gone.

14:57.472 --> 15:00.732
(beeping)

15:03.128 --> 15:04.402
Ahh! Got the key.

15:04.479 --> 15:06.646
Hello, freedom. (Screaming)

15:06.722 --> 15:07.980
(laughs evilly)

15:12.561 --> 15:16.139
- Ahh!
- Destroy! Destroy!

15:16.141 --> 15:18.232
Ahh-hah, this is exactly why

15:18.309 --> 15:19.918
I don't believe
in Christmas miracles!

15:19.994 --> 15:22.244
You get me!

15:24.315 --> 15:26.482
What? What's going on?

15:26.484 --> 15:31.245
I sense you don't believe in the
spirit of Christmas, either.

15:31.322 --> 15:33.414
What, you only attack people
who love Christmas?

15:33.491 --> 15:34.991
Is that a crime?

15:34.993 --> 15:36.175
Yes!

15:39.164 --> 15:42.589
(beeping) - Paige, the
robot hates Christmas.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.500
If you and the kids change outta
your holiday sweaters and act like

15:44.502 --> 15:46.927
you hate Christmas too,
he'll leave you alone.

15:47.005 --> 15:48.285
- (beeping)
- No. Sorry, Frankie.

15:48.356 --> 15:51.765
These kids believe in
holiday magic, and so do I.

15:51.843 --> 15:55.269
Trust me! All they want right
now is a Christmas story.

15:55.346 --> 15:58.197
Ramona: When are we gonna get
to eat the Christmas cookies?

15:58.274 --> 16:00.774
Paige: Ramona, I am going
to wrap my hands around...

16:00.852 --> 16:01.909
This book.

16:03.855 --> 16:05.871
Twas the night before Christmas!

16:05.948 --> 16:07.465
And all through the house...

16:07.542 --> 16:11.194
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse. -(Buzzing)

16:11.196 --> 16:15.214
This is pointless!
It's goin' too slow.

16:15.291 --> 16:17.642
(modem noise) - Hang on.
I have an idea.

16:17.719 --> 16:19.626
(tapping keys, beeping)

16:19.704 --> 16:23.055
(power turns off)

16:23.132 --> 16:25.599
Agh. Rough day with
computers for the Bern-Man.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.638
Wait! What does that
tube connect to?

16:31.716 --> 16:36.810
I always assumed it was a theme
park ride for the rats in here.

16:36.888 --> 16:40.281
In the old days, businesses used
tubes like this to send messages.

16:43.411 --> 16:48.840
Vuuugle under attack, send help.

16:48.916 --> 16:50.624
I'm stuck.

17:01.003 --> 17:03.262
I don't know where this goes.

17:03.339 --> 17:04.346
But it's our only hope!

17:08.511 --> 17:10.419
Man!
If it doesn't reach anybody,

17:10.421 --> 17:13.756
we're gonna die at the hands
of an evil Santa robot.

17:13.758 --> 17:16.942
(sighs) Yeah. Maybe.

17:17.019 --> 17:19.595
And, if the robot
escapes Vuuugle,

17:19.597 --> 17:21.021
it'll probably
destroy the world.

17:21.099 --> 17:24.267
Yeah. Maybe.

17:24.269 --> 17:27.027
So, since this
is the end and all,

17:27.105 --> 17:28.604
we might as well kiss, right?

17:28.606 --> 17:31.382
Yeah. Maybe.

17:31.459 --> 17:32.979
Ah. Well, can't blame
a guy for tryin'.

17:33.628 --> 17:35.044
Wait, what?

17:37.115 --> 17:40.040
That's right, Bernie.
Given the circumstances,

17:40.118 --> 17:42.134
I'm... considerin' it.

17:43.788 --> 17:45.121
(fireworks exploding)

17:45.123 --> 17:47.231
(dolphins squeaking)

17:47.308 --> 17:49.400
('20s music playing)

17:53.131 --> 17:57.133
(Indian music playing)

17:57.135 --> 17:58.234
(roaring)

18:01.139 --> 18:03.531
I mean, yeah, sure.
If that's what you wanna do.

18:05.901 --> 18:08.160
Now Dasher! Now Dancer!

18:08.237 --> 18:09.087
- (thudding)
- Now Pran...

18:09.163 --> 18:10.980
You can't hide!

18:10.982 --> 18:14.592
(kids screaming)

18:14.669 --> 18:18.003
Which part of "you can't hide"
did you not understand?

18:18.080 --> 18:20.156
(beeping)

18:20.158 --> 18:21.099
Frankie: ♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪

18:21.175 --> 18:23.492
♪ We wish you

18:23.494 --> 18:26.011
- ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas

18:26.088 --> 18:27.421
♪ And a Happy New Year ♪

18:27.498 --> 18:30.683

18:32.503 --> 18:35.113

It's the holidays!

18:38.693 --> 18:42.878
Let's all hug and believe
in miracles and stuff!

18:42.880 --> 18:45.105
I thought we had a connection.

18:45.183 --> 18:46.740
Not cool!

18:49.278 --> 18:51.796
- It's the key to the secret door.
- What about you?

18:51.873 --> 18:52.538
It's too late for me!
Save yourself!

18:52.615 --> 18:54.465
Ahh!

18:58.363 --> 19:00.796
I said... Christmas is canceled.

19:05.219 --> 19:07.478
Liam! You're out of your robot!

19:07.555 --> 19:10.723
And you're real!
And... And you're here!

19:10.799 --> 19:13.300
And you have legs!

19:13.378 --> 19:15.227
You owe me 10 bucks, by the way.

19:17.215 --> 19:19.064
How did you know
to come help us?

19:19.141 --> 19:21.308
Oh, I... I received
this emergency message.

19:21.386 --> 19:22.946
I... I have no idea
who wrote it, but...

19:24.480 --> 19:25.571
they saved a lot of lives.

19:27.241 --> 19:28.891
It's a Christmas miracle!

19:28.893 --> 19:31.151
Frankie, you believe!

19:31.229 --> 19:32.328
It is a Christmas miracle!

19:34.657 --> 19:37.157
(beep) - Hey, kids.
Come out, it's safe.

19:37.235 --> 19:40.178
Hey, Liam. Since you're here,
why don't you join us?

19:40.254 --> 19:44.348
We can enjoy what's left of Christmas
together as a Vuuugle family.

19:44.425 --> 19:49.078
Paige... Frankie.
Because it's the holidays...

19:49.080 --> 19:50.429
no.

19:53.434 --> 19:56.085
Look what I have!
My famous holiday fruitcake.

19:56.087 --> 19:58.679
- Try some!
- Mm. You know, we've been through a lot,

19:58.756 --> 20:00.198
we're not in the mood. I said-

20:00.274 --> 20:05.369
And I said, we've been through
a lot, we're not in the mood!

20:05.446 --> 20:09.373
It's the holidays,
you don't have to be so mean!

20:09.450 --> 20:11.617
Hey, get away from those toys!

20:16.941 --> 20:19.792
Hey, guys. Um... we're
so sorry for giving you

20:19.868 --> 20:21.293
- such a horrible Christmas.
- Mm.

20:21.370 --> 20:24.964
- Can I say something?
- We know, you want your cookies.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.725
No. I wanna say thank you.

20:27.802 --> 20:32.455
Not only has this been the
most exciting Christmas ever,

20:32.457 --> 20:33.525
but we got to spend it
with our heroes.

20:33.549 --> 20:35.307
We love you guys.

20:38.721 --> 20:41.054
(Paige laughs)
Aw... sorry, Frankie.

20:41.132 --> 20:42.740
I know you hate emotion.

20:42.817 --> 20:45.910
I love the holidays so much!

20:49.640 --> 20:52.032
Okay, Bernie.
I've thought about it.

20:53.644 --> 20:58.589
Since it's the end of the world, I guess...
we can kiss.

20:58.666 --> 20:59.740
Yes!

20:59.817 --> 21:00.817
Yes!

21:04.155 --> 21:05.337
Yes!

21:05.414 --> 21:06.764
I mean...

21:06.841 --> 21:08.257
cool, cool.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.666
Guys! We just killed the
killer Santa robot!

21:17.668 --> 21:19.226
Oh, thank goodness!

21:20.505 --> 21:22.021
Oh...

21:22.097 --> 21:24.765
Mwah!

21:24.842 --> 21:25.674
Wait, wait wait wait, hold on!

21:25.676 --> 21:28.119
Let's not rush to conclusions!

21:28.195 --> 21:29.528
Are we sure that the robot

21:29.605 --> 21:31.196
didn't just download
another virus?

21:31.273 --> 21:35.017
(tapping keys) - Come on,
I need a Bernie miracle!

21:35.019 --> 21:37.036
(crash)

21:37.112 --> 21:40.080
Aww! Every day is worst
than the last!

21:43.194 --> 21:44.468
Hey, guys, Bizaardvark here

21:44.545 --> 21:45.636
with Bernie, Amelia,

21:45.713 --> 21:47.024
- and Horse Face Guy.
- Here at Vuuugle,

21:47.048 --> 21:48.622
we have a Christmas tradition,

21:48.699 --> 21:51.976
where we all hang out in our
pajamas in the middle of the day.

21:52.053 --> 21:54.812
And then Horse Face Guy
gives us our presents,

21:54.889 --> 21:56.480
and we try and guess
what they are.

21:56.557 --> 21:59.299
Knowing Horse Face Guy,
this is gonna get weird.

21:59.377 --> 22:01.544
Let's see what he's got
for us this year.

22:01.546 --> 22:03.154
It's heavy, and it's cold.

22:03.230 --> 22:05.564
Ice? Is this ice?

22:05.641 --> 22:07.808
- (gasping)
- It's ice!

22:07.885 --> 22:09.476
Thank you so much,
Horse Face Guy,

22:09.554 --> 22:11.495
it's the most
thoughtful gift ever.

22:11.572 --> 22:13.664
It smells like nothing,
sounds like nothing,

22:13.741 --> 22:14.890
and it feels like nothing.

22:14.892 --> 22:16.316
Let's see what it is.

22:16.352 --> 22:17.743
- It's a horn!
- (tooting horn)

22:17.820 --> 22:20.504
- (all cheering)
- (horn tooting)

22:20.581 --> 22:23.232
- (box rattling)
- I'm guessing it's rocks.

22:23.234 --> 22:24.567
Amelia:
Why would he get you rocks?

22:24.569 --> 22:25.879
- Bunch of kazoos!
- (indistinct chatter)

22:25.903 --> 22:28.512
(playing kazoos)

22:28.589 --> 22:31.498
(rattling package) - It's really
small, it sounds like small.

22:31.576 --> 22:32.925
- Oh, puzzle!
- It's a puzzle!

22:33.001 --> 22:35.427
He got you a puzzle!

22:35.504 --> 22:37.913
- It's so pretty, I don't know where it is.
- It's a coastline.

22:37.915 --> 22:38.839
- It's another box!
- It's another box!

22:38.916 --> 22:40.432
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:40.509 --> 22:43.919
I'm gonna assume there's another
box inside the other box.

22:43.921 --> 22:45.248
- No, he wouldn't do that.
- He would do that.

22:45.272 --> 22:47.439
(gasping and screaming)

22:47.516 --> 22:49.797
- So, we bought a little something for you.
- So generous.

22:50.686 --> 22:52.686
- (gasp)
- Woo!

22:52.763 --> 22:53.929
- A new pair of shorts!
- Do you like 'em?

22:53.931 --> 22:56.523
- Yeah, yeah!
- (cheers)

22:56.601 --> 22:57.375
Oh my gosh,
that's a great outfit.

22:57.451 --> 22:59.526
All: Happy Holidays!

22:59.604 --> 23:02.921
Man's voice: Ho, ho, ho!
