WEBVTT

00:02.667 --> 00:04.709
Oh, yeah! Check it out!

00:04.792 --> 00:06.291
I got this!

00:06.583 --> 00:08.125
I got this!

00:09.166 --> 00:11.375
I don't got this! Whoa!

00:15.792 --> 00:18.417
Dude, you just put a hole in the wall.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.166
You gotta help me out.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.792
This wall is putting up a fight.

00:36.625 --> 00:39.709
Rudy, that's exactly like
the Bo Staff we just lost...

00:39.792 --> 00:40.709
He did it!

00:41.667 --> 00:43.250
What is wrong with you two?

00:43.333 --> 00:46.875
We have the biggest tournament
in the history of this dojo tomorrow!

00:46.959 --> 00:48.041
That's right.

00:48.125 --> 00:49.750
Tomorrow I get my orange belt.

00:49.834 --> 00:51.834
That is exact... Wait,
that's this tournament?

00:52.750 --> 00:53.917
I mean, of course it is.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.959
Yes, uh, we're all very proud of you.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.041
Good work, son.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.458
<i>Hey, where have you guys been?</i>

00:59.542 --> 01:01.500
Practice started a half-hour ago.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.083
Sorry, Rudy. It's Wednesday.
We volunteer at the nursing home.

01:04.166 --> 01:05.917
"We volunteer at the nursing home".

01:06.542 --> 01:08.125
Get your priorities straight, people.

01:08.208 --> 01:10.500
Tomorrow is the Champions Tournament!

01:10.583 --> 01:14.417
- Where I am getting my orange belt.
- I said we're proud of you, now zip it!

01:15.709 --> 01:19.000
Rudy, man, you're a little wound up,
but we are ready for the tournament.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.000
Kim's been helping me
with my spinning back-kick.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.291
Yeah, show him, Jack.

01:24.166 --> 01:25.000
Ready?

01:29.458 --> 01:30.750
That is perfect.

01:30.834 --> 01:33.000
You need to do exactly that tomorrow.

01:33.083 --> 01:35.250
You never know
who's gonna be watching you.

01:35.291 --> 01:37.291
My whole family's coming
to watch me get my orange belt.

01:37.417 --> 01:39.959
Oh, please. Let it go!

01:42.917 --> 01:46.083

02:24.625 --> 02:27.834
Yo, yo. Karate tournament tonight, ladies.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.166
Jack's gonna be there.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.709
Hey, tell Jack my friends and I will be
at the tournament to cheer him on.

02:39.291 --> 02:42.583
I'm competing also, so I guess
you'll be cheering me on, too. Right?

02:42.667 --> 02:46.250
- Jerry, you and I will never...
-

02:46.667 --> 02:49.125
Let's not rush this, okay? Let it breathe.

02:49.208 --> 02:52.083
He put his finger on my lips
and it smelled like feet.

02:52.166 --> 02:53.250
Oh!

02:54.375 --> 02:55.375
What?

02:56.875 --> 02:59.291
Yo, there's that new kid.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.125
I heard he transferred here
from his other school

03:01.208 --> 03:02.834
because he stole his principal's car.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.709
We don't know he did anything.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.750
I don't judge a book by its cover.

03:06.834 --> 03:08.542
- Let's go talk to him.
What?

03:08.625 --> 03:10.583
- Milton, what are you doing? Come on. Oh!
- Hey, there.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.917
My name is Milton. These are my friends.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.959
I hold out my arms to you as a welcoming
symbol of acceptance to our school.

03:17.542 --> 03:19.041
We're not hugging, dude.

03:21.083 --> 03:24.792
I high-five you as a welcoming
symbol of acceptance to our school.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.291
Come on, new kid. Nothing?

03:38.125 --> 03:40.834
-
- Whoo! Yay, Eddie!

03:42.959 --> 03:45.000
Oh. Thank you, sensei.

03:47.709 --> 03:50.583
Today, I have become a man.

03:50.834 --> 03:54.583
From this day forward, when I pee,
I will do it standing!

03:55.709 --> 03:58.041
Oh, he's here, he's here, he's here!

03:58.125 --> 03:59.667
Uh, who's here?

03:59.750 --> 04:01.834
Uh, certainly not a mysterious stranger
from Japan

04:01.917 --> 04:03.458
who could change our lives forever.

04:08.834 --> 04:09.875
I'm kinda nervous.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.458
This guy I'm going up against
hasn't lost in two years.

04:15.125 --> 04:17.083
Well, he's about to.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.500
He doesn't know who he's messing with.

04:19.792 --> 04:22.583
Bobby Wasabi's best student right here!

04:22.667 --> 04:24.458
- You don't want any of this!
- Kim, stop, please.

04:24.542 --> 04:27.041
'Cause boom goes the dynamite! Boom!

04:27.125 --> 04:29.834
Kim, stop booming. People are looking.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.834
Yes, yes!

05:16.834 --> 05:19.208
So what'd you think about Jack?
Is he as good as I said?

05:19.291 --> 05:20.208
No.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.333
He's better. I'll meet with the boy.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.125
I am the greatest sensei in the world!

05:28.750 --> 05:31.166
Jack, you did it. That was incredible.

05:47.583 --> 05:51.250
Woo-eee.

05:51.625 --> 05:55.208
You're turning this dojo into
a Hungarian hothouse, missy.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.208
What are you talking about, Joan?

05:58.291 --> 06:02.458
Oh, I saw what was going on
between you and Mr. Kicky-kicky-chop-chop.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.417
There's nothing going on between us.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.250
Oh, ho-ho, really?

06:07.333 --> 06:10.917
Well, let me just take out
my old passion meter, huh?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.041
Boop. Boop. Boop.

06:13.125 --> 06:14.792
Boop!

06:14.875 --> 06:19.041
Ooh, your first love
is the most important one of your life.

06:19.125 --> 06:22.458
You just pick up the old Joan phone
if you're ready to talk or, you know...

06:22.542 --> 06:24.208
- kick it.
-

06:24.291 --> 06:26.208
Oh! Holy Hanna!

06:26.750 --> 06:29.917
Base, I'm gonna need a woman's right.
Eight-and-a-half. Stat.

06:32.417 --> 06:36.917
-Welcome to the A/
-V Club,
or as we call it, the Cool Kids Club.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.125
Here is where we keep the laptops.

06:43.667 --> 06:47.208
Oh, and right here... number of days
since a club member has been wedgied.

06:47.291 --> 06:48.959
Wedgie free for 23.

06:55.208 --> 06:57.041
They got me right outside the library.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.291
I never saw it coming.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.417
Milton, can I talk to you in private?

07:05.500 --> 07:06.583
Whatever you would say to me,

07:06.667 --> 07:08.250
you can say
in front of my new friend Zane.

07:08.583 --> 07:09.750
Okay...

07:09.834 --> 07:12.709
Your new friend is a criminal!

07:14.542 --> 07:16.250
Shame on you.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.834
Shame, I say!

07:17.917 --> 07:21.000
This boy will not be an outcast
because of a mere rumor.

07:21.834 --> 07:26.000
Zane, I will not allow you
to wear the shackles of a reputation.

07:26.083 --> 07:30.667
Because of me, you will always
drink the purified waters of freedom.

07:30.750 --> 07:31.875
Freedom!

07:34.041 --> 07:36.583
Emmitt, I don't judge
a book by its cover...

07:36.667 --> 07:39.166
Dude, I'm locked in.

07:40.166 --> 07:41.166
Hello?

07:43.166 --> 07:45.792
Jack, you're just so awesome.

07:45.875 --> 07:49.208
I mean, that fly-kicky thing
you did was, like, wow!

07:49.291 --> 07:50.375
I hope you like the balloon.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.041
- Oh, thanks.
-

07:52.375 --> 07:54.291
See you, Jack.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.917
"I mean that fly-kicky thing
you did was, like, oh, wow!"

08:02.709 --> 08:04.709
You really don't like her, do you?

08:04.792 --> 08:07.125
- What makes you say that? Hey, look!
-

08:08.542 --> 08:10.125
Late to class. See ya.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.333
You dweebs just pantsed me?

08:21.458 --> 08:23.709
- They got caught in my locker.
- Here we go!

08:23.792 --> 08:26.000
Hey, you heard him. It was an accident.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.083
One day, he's not gonna be here
to protect you.

08:34.792 --> 08:37.125
My training was in Tokyo.

08:37.792 --> 08:40.166
My first sensei was old Master Lee.

08:40.917 --> 08:44.667
He was a blind monk whose dojo
was on the side of a mountain.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.041
My first sensei was a guy named Carl.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.208
Um, he could braid his nose hairs

08:52.291 --> 08:54.834
and his dojo was made out
of refrigerator boxes.

08:57.542 --> 08:58.709
I wasn't kidding.

09:00.542 --> 09:01.917
Uh, Rudy, you wanted to see me.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.750
Uh, Jack, this is Master Tanaka
from the Otai Academy.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.542
Whoa! The Otai Academy?

09:10.625 --> 09:13.667
The greatest martial arts masters
in the world trained there.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.625
I guess I'm the exception to that rule.

09:15.709 --> 09:17.083
Am I right?

09:17.959 --> 09:20.583
It's such an honor to meet you,
Master Tanaka.

09:21.709 --> 09:24.875
The heart and skill I witnessed
at the tournament have proven to me,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.166
that you have the makings of a champion.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.250
Let's talk.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.250
Next time you're in town, call me.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.750
It doesn't have to be business,
we can just hang.

09:37.417 --> 09:38.709
Do you foosball?

09:40.375 --> 09:41.750
All right, everybody, bring it in!

09:41.834 --> 09:44.583
Jack has an unbelievable
announcement to make.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.792
It's a little crazy,

09:46.875 --> 09:50.166
but I just got offered a scholarship
to the Otai Academy.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.917
So full of pride.

09:53.208 --> 09:54.417
What?

09:54.500 --> 09:56.959
But the Otai Academy is in Japan.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.291
Wait, what, what are you saying, Jack?

09:59.709 --> 10:01.125
I'm moving to Japan.

10:01.208 --> 10:02.583
<i>What?</i>

10:02.667 --> 10:04.792
Oh, no. My legs are going.

10:04.875 --> 10:07.125
Mat me! Mat me, Jerry!

10:11.792 --> 10:13.667
Dude, you gotta be more specific.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.166
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

10:17.250 --> 10:19.709
I still can't believe
that I'm moving to Japan.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.625
I mean, I leave Friday.

10:21.709 --> 10:23.625
I was just reading
about the Otai Academy.

10:23.709 --> 10:26.208
This brochure says the scholarship
is for four years.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.875
When you come back, we'll be in college.

10:28.959 --> 10:31.458
Wow, you... you're right.

10:31.542 --> 10:33.583
Man, this place is unbelievable!

10:33.667 --> 10:36.542
State of the art training center,
outdoor dojo...

10:36.875 --> 10:40.291
And the cafeteria has got
a "make your own waffle" station! Shut up!

10:42.500 --> 10:44.417
Sounds like a great opportunity.

10:44.959 --> 10:46.333
I'll catch up with you guys later.

10:48.500 --> 10:52.875
Man. Dude, it's gonna be weird
not being here every day.

10:53.417 --> 10:55.834
Jack, you're such a big part of this dojo.

10:55.917 --> 10:57.458
I bet Rudy isn't happy.

10:57.542 --> 11:00.875
I am the happiest
I've ever been in my life!

11:01.542 --> 11:04.583
I overnighted a bunch of stuff
from the Otai bookstore.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.792
Dude, listen to this,
it's your school fight song.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.250
- It's super catchy.
-

11:21.041 --> 11:21.959
Ah!

11:23.959 --> 11:27.291
Great. Now I'm not gonna be able
to get that song of my head.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.041
Ah!

11:40.208 --> 11:42.041
Hey, why so glum, soul sister?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.750
Remember when I was in the dojo,

11:43.834 --> 11:46.291
and I told you
I didn't have any feelings for Jack?

11:46.375 --> 11:48.166
- Mm-hmm.
- I kinda do.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.125
But it doesn't really matter now.
He's moving to Japan.

11:52.208 --> 11:53.208
What?

11:53.917 --> 11:55.500
Let me tell you something.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.542
Eighth grade, the first boy I ever
had feelings for, Brendan Harper,

11:59.625 --> 12:02.417
tells me he's moving to Wisconsin.
You know what I did?

12:02.500 --> 12:04.500
You were honest with him
and told him how you felt?

12:04.583 --> 12:06.875
No. I put chains around his legs
and locked him in our woodshed.

12:08.375 --> 12:11.834
If you love something, don't set it free.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.709
You'll never see it again.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.083
Thanks, Joan.

12:20.291 --> 12:22.125
You really think we can replace Jack?

12:22.208 --> 12:23.500
Well, we've gotta try.

12:23.583 --> 12:26.250
I mean without Jack,
not a single girl is gonna talk to us.

12:26.333 --> 12:29.500
Forget girls, we've got no protection
from Frank and his thugs.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.291
At least when Kim's not around.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.917
- All right, let's do this.
- Whoo!

12:40.000 --> 12:43.083
What makes you think
you can be the next Jack?

12:43.166 --> 12:45.959
First of all, I have pretty awesome hair.

12:47.709 --> 12:50.875
And like Jack, I have two moles.

12:50.959 --> 12:52.834
One's on my neck and one's on my--

12:52.917 --> 12:54.208
Next!

12:59.333 --> 13:01.625
Close your eyes and picture a--

13:01.709 --> 13:02.875
Next!

13:07.917 --> 13:10.125
Wait, what is your criminal friend
doing here?

13:10.959 --> 13:12.583
He's not a criminal!

13:12.625 --> 13:15.917
I don't care what he is,
he's got gorgeous girls with him.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.375
<i>Whoo!</i>

13:17.458 --> 13:20.208
Uh, Zane, are you here to audition?

13:20.291 --> 13:22.709
I came to bring the sweater you left
-in the A/
-V Club.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.000
Hey, you mind?

13:31.500 --> 13:33.709
Whoa. You know karate?

13:33.792 --> 13:34.834
A little bit.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.750
Holy Christmas nuts!

13:46.458 --> 13:49.583
Congratulations! You're our new Jack!

13:49.667 --> 13:51.917
- Woo!
- You did it, Zane.

<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

13:54.625 --> 13:57.375
Okay, let's try it one more time.
I think I got it.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.834
We swear by the light
of the dragon's eye,

14:00.917 --> 14:03.250
to be loyal and honest and never say die.

14:03.291 --> 14:04.959
- Wasabi!
-

14:05.041 --> 14:06.542
- You got it, Zane.
- Thanks.

14:06.625 --> 14:08.583
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Jack.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.250
This is Zane. He's the new you.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.917
Yeah, yeah, that's no problem.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.792
I was coming to clean it out anyway.

14:24.041 --> 14:28.500
Uh, look, Jack, he's just
the new guy in the dojo.

14:28.583 --> 14:29.959
Nobody could replace you.

14:30.041 --> 14:32.166
We're going to Falafel Phil's
with Jack's replacement.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.417
See you.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.291
<i>Psst.</i>

14:37.959 --> 14:41.291
Put chains around his legs
and throw him in the locker.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.709
Don't set him free.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.542
You'll never see him again!

14:46.625 --> 14:49.250
You'll never see him again!

14:50.250 --> 14:51.959
Kim? Check these out.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.166
We took this at the photo booth
down at the pier, remember?

14:54.250 --> 14:57.458
Oh, yeah. I can't believe
you still have those.

14:57.542 --> 14:59.875
There's four pictures here.
You take two and I'll take two?

14:59.959 --> 15:01.458
- Yeah.
-

15:02.917 --> 15:04.542
Hey, I remember that one.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.250
That's where I gave you a wet willy.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.709
Oh, look at the next one.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.917
That's the one
where I gave you a black eye.

15:13.417 --> 15:16.333
Guys! There's something weird going on.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.667
I just discovered a laptop is missing.

15:18.750 --> 15:22.458
I went to talk to Emmitt about it,
no one has seen Emmitt in two days.

15:22.917 --> 15:25.083
And Zane was the last person to see him.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.917
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying...

15:35.875 --> 15:37.583
- You guys didn't see anything, did you?
- Nope.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.542
- Absolutely not.
- The sun was in my eyes.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.375
Holy Christmas nuts!

15:45.458 --> 15:48.250
We've just replaced Jack
with a homicidal maniac!

15:50.333 --> 15:52.834
Francis, would it kill you
to practice in the band room?

15:55.750 --> 15:58.542
Listen, I rethought your whole situation.

15:58.583 --> 16:02.208
Before Jack leaves,
he has to know what's in your heart.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.792
I tried, but the words
just don't come out.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.959
That's because the heart
doesn't speak...

16:41.083 --> 16:43.375
We know what you're hiding in that locker.

16:44.375 --> 16:47.583
Zane stole a laptop and when he realized
Emmitt was on to him,

16:47.667 --> 16:50.625
he eliminated him and stuffed him
into his locker.

16:54.583 --> 16:55.875
No, I didn't.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.792
I saw the dojo equipment
was pretty beaten up,

16:59.875 --> 17:01.709
so I got this for you guys.

17:01.792 --> 17:03.750
Aw.

17:06.041 --> 17:08.417
You guys are freaks! I'm out of here.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.291
Oh, excuse me.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.583
I guess none of you people
ever accused an innocent boy

17:17.667 --> 17:19.667
of being a homicidal maniac.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.291
It happens!

17:25.959 --> 17:29.709
Hey, Frank, any interest
in being the new Jack?

17:34.417 --> 17:36.291
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

17:36.375 --> 17:38.583
Guys, I keep texting Kim,
but she's not answering.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.250
- I'm sure she's gonna show up.
- Yeah.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.959
We're running out of time.
My dad's gonna be here, like, any minute.

17:43.417 --> 17:45.625
Oh, man, I'm going to miss you guys.

17:46.125 --> 17:48.792
You guys are literally
the best friends I'll ever have.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.250
And I love you, guys.

17:51.333 --> 17:52.875
Promise me you'll have each other's backs.

17:53.125 --> 17:55.458
- Yeah. Sure.
- Come on.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.166
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Have a good time.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.750
Never thought I'd say this...

18:04.125 --> 18:05.291
Bye.

18:10.750 --> 18:14.709
I didn't want him to see me like this.

18:15.417 --> 18:16.792
I almost forgot my stuff.

18:16.875 --> 18:18.417
Jack, what's up, bro?

18:18.500 --> 18:21.291
You know I'm just helping Eddie.
'Cause he's not strong like me.

18:21.417 --> 18:24.208
You're overreacting. Shh, be quiet.

18:26.792 --> 18:28.417
<i>Bye, Jack.</i>
- See you.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.417
So are you excited?

18:36.917 --> 18:39.250
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, hey, can you do me a favor?

18:39.333 --> 18:40.875
Uh, give this letter to Kim?

18:40.959 --> 18:43.125
I, uh, wrote down some things
that I wanted her to know.

18:43.208 --> 18:44.208
Sure.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.375
Ah...

18:47.458 --> 18:50.750
The adventure that lies before ye.

18:51.208 --> 18:53.375
Foreign lands, grand masters...

18:53.458 --> 18:55.959
Don't even get me started
on that waffle bar.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.291
Yeah, it's a world-class facility,

18:58.959 --> 19:01.458
but, uh, this dojo
is always gonna be home.

19:01.542 --> 19:02.709
Of course it'll be.

19:02.792 --> 19:06.208
But this is an opportunity of a lifetime
and you're getting a free ride!

19:07.333 --> 19:08.583
I know it's free, but...

19:11.125 --> 19:14.250
I can't help think that it might
cost me everything that I care about.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.959
What... what do you mean?

19:16.041 --> 19:17.417
I don't know.

19:17.959 --> 19:21.000
It's just by the time I get back...

19:21.709 --> 19:23.875
What we have in that dojo
won't be here anymore.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.083
It...

19:27.709 --> 19:29.709
Oh, I didn't even think of it like that.

19:30.875 --> 19:33.500
You're right. I was so excited
about what you were gaining,

19:33.583 --> 19:35.375
I didn't even think about
what you were losing.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.083
Don't get me wrong,
the waffle bar sounds pretty great.

19:38.166 --> 19:39.625
Oh, yeah, no, the waffles are a given.

19:42.667 --> 19:45.041
Martial arts is really important to me.

19:46.208 --> 19:47.709
But so are my friends.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.375
If I leave, I'll have one of those.

19:51.125 --> 19:54.208
But if I stay, I'll have both.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.125
Sounds like you know what you want to do.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.250
Yeah.

20:01.875 --> 20:02.959
Yeah, I do.

20:06.542 --> 20:07.750
I'm really glad you're staying.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.500
And I know this might sound
a little crazy,

20:10.583 --> 20:12.792
but I would really like to...

20:12.875 --> 20:14.458
Go to Otai and pretend that I'm you?

20:16.417 --> 20:18.875
All right, whatever.
I'm gonna go eat what's left of your face.

20:19.959 --> 20:23.250
Oh, Kim, Jack put some of his
personal thoughts down in this letter

20:23.291 --> 20:25.291
and wanted me to give it to you,
so see ya.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.125
Um, it's okay, Jack.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.125
I did the same thing.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.166
There's some things
that I wanted you to know.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.041
But promise me you'll wait to read it
till you're on the plane.

20:37.083 --> 20:38.500
I would but...

20:39.375 --> 20:40.500
I changed my mind.

20:40.959 --> 20:41.959
I'm not going.

20:43.959 --> 20:48.083
Well, in that case,
I'm just gonna say it...

20:49.583 --> 20:51.417
- I want my letter back.
- And I want mine.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.291
So what made you change your mind
about going to Japan?

20:56.792 --> 20:58.500
Oh, I don't know.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.709
I thought it might cost too much.

21:02.959 --> 21:05.083

This next song's going out

And, uh, I don't want to embarrass them
by saying their names,

21:15.041 --> 21:16.875
but they rhyme with shmack and shmim.
