Who wants a cookie?

00:44.411 --> 00:46.710
Milk-dipped
chocolate-chip cookie!

00:46.780 --> 00:47.839
No, thanks.

00:47.914 --> 00:51.248
Now, come on, Finn.
You <i>ha ve</i> to eat.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.445
Open sesame!

00:53.520 --> 00:55.887
Uh, Jake... can't we get
rid of these clown nurses?

00:55.955 --> 00:57.821
They make me feel <i>ridiculous.</i>

00:57.891 --> 00:59.359
No way, man.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.325
Ugh!

01:00.393 --> 01:03.158
Well, now you know we
can't jump off of birds.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.634
I paid them up front.

01:09.702 --> 01:11.330
They don't leave until
the job's done.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.404
Besides...

01:13.573 --> 01:14.836
they're funny.

01:17.043 --> 01:19.274
Look! She just farted!

01:19.345 --> 01:22.543
Time for our love therapy.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.345
Wait... what are they doing?

01:25.418 --> 01:26.716
Whoa! Stop!

01:26.786 --> 01:29.051
Oh, my! Did that hurt, dear?

01:29.122 --> 01:31.853
No! I just don't want
you kissing my toe!

01:31.925 --> 01:33.359
Now, now, honey.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.793
You got to understand
that this is the <i>only</i> way

01:35.862 --> 01:37.524
to foo-foo your boo-boo.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.225
What does that even mean?!

01:39.299 --> 01:42.463
I don't know, but I'm
feeling better already.

01:42.535 --> 01:44.470
Aah! That tickles.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.028
You want me to stop?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.472
No, keep going.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.302
You're gross, man.

01:51.377 --> 01:52.470
Look!

01:52.545 --> 01:54.036
"Deep in the forest of trees,

01:54.114 --> 01:57.516
there's a Cyclops whose magical
tears can heal any wound."

01:57.584 --> 01:59.052
See? See?!

01:59.119 --> 02:01.679
Maybe you should leave
the medical decisions

02:01.754 --> 02:04.121
to the medical professionals.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.056
And my professional
prescription is

02:06.126 --> 02:10.757
your toe needs c-razy smooches!

02:10.830 --> 02:13.698
It's the only way!

02:18.304 --> 02:19.636
Huh? What?!

02:24.711 --> 02:26.236
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

02:26.312 --> 02:27.780
There's another way!
There's <i>my</i> way!

02:27.847 --> 02:28.847
Let me show you <i>my</i> way!

02:30.316 --> 02:32.046
Aah! Let me go!

02:33.686 --> 02:36.246
Aaaaaaaah!

02:39.959 --> 02:42.190
Whoa!

02:42.262 --> 02:43.161
Oof!

02:43.229 --> 02:44.253
Huh?

02:44.330 --> 02:46.299
It's the only way!

02:48.434 --> 02:49.697
Whoa!

02:49.769 --> 02:51.533
Waah! Waah!

02:53.373 --> 02:55.205
Whoa!

02:58.111 --> 02:59.943
It's the only way.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.572
Aaaaaaah!

03:04.184 --> 03:05.413
My way!

03:15.228 --> 03:17.493
Hmm.

03:17.564 --> 03:19.624
Ring! Ring!

03:19.699 --> 03:22.134
Look, there's only
two choices, bro.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.363
Take your pick.

03:23.436 --> 03:24.665
There's a path on the left...

03:24.737 --> 03:27.639
"Hair Fall Out path," no
more hair again <i>e ver!</i>

03:27.707 --> 03:29.198
Or the path on the right...

03:29.275 --> 03:32.712
"Smelly path," makes
you smelly forever.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.975
You won't believe it.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.778
Isn't there another way?

03:36.849 --> 03:37.976
No.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.986
- What if I just went...
- No. That's it.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.653
You have to choose.
There's no other way.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.555
Choosing is the <i>only</i> way.

03:44.624 --> 03:48.493
Choosing is the only way.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.928
It's the only way!

03:52.432 --> 03:56.836
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

03:57.937 --> 03:59.235
Hey, listen, man...

03:59.305 --> 04:01.035
The Smelly Path's
actually not that bad.

04:01.107 --> 04:02.507
Uh... uhh...

04:02.575 --> 04:05.204
No! I choose <i>my</i> way!

04:05.278 --> 04:06.439
Aaaaah!

04:06.512 --> 04:07.512
My way.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.489
Hmm.

04:25.565 --> 04:28.433
Ring! Ring!

04:28.501 --> 04:30.732
Hello, dummy police?

04:30.803 --> 04:35.070
Yes, there's a strange dummy
lurking around my house.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.769
Okay. Yes.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.108
Thank you. Goodbye.

04:39.178 --> 04:41.374
What?

04:41.447 --> 04:43.382
I need to cross the river.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.213
The cyclops is over there.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.380
You can't cross this river.
It's impossible.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.047
Look, the current...

04:50.123 --> 04:52.388
It's so fast, it'll turn
your butt inside out

04:52.458 --> 04:54.222
for real, doofus.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.024
And the water's so acidic,

04:56.095 --> 04:57.791
it'll krump your boat in half.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.959
It's like orange juice.
It's gross.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.128
There's a bridge,
but it's a trap.

05:03.202 --> 05:07.139
Plus, the water's jammin'
with electric eels!

05:07.206 --> 05:09.903
Wow. So weird.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.569
Anyway, that's it.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.637
There's no other way
around, you dummy.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.580
But I need to get across.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.481
Listen what I'm telling you.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.042
There's no way!

05:21.654 --> 05:23.623
Ugly tramp.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.088
Glob, globbit, globbit, globbit!

05:30.163 --> 05:31.756
Huh? What are you saying?

05:31.831 --> 05:34.824
"Globbit, globbit"?
Who's globbit?

05:34.901 --> 05:36.301
Aah!

05:36.369 --> 05:37.564
My way!

05:51.718 --> 05:53.016
No!

05:56.656 --> 05:57.656
Peugghhh!

05:57.690 --> 06:01.388
Glibby-glab man, you're crazy!

06:01.461 --> 06:04.021
We're not even halfway across!

06:04.097 --> 06:05.998
You got to go back, man!

06:07.400 --> 06:11.838
It's the only way, you ugly,
fat-smelling, fathead!

06:11.904 --> 06:13.429
No! <i>My</i> way!

06:13.506 --> 06:16.408
Aah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

06:21.047 --> 06:24.074
Uuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

06:27.520 --> 06:28.520
Crazy!

06:28.554 --> 06:30.386
Globba, globba, globba, globba.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.049
Uh, excuse me, friend.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.616
Blblblblblblblblblblbl! Huh?

06:33.693 --> 06:34.717
You're pretty tall.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.025
Can you reach up there
and get my wheel for me?

06:37.096 --> 06:39.065
Got to get these melons
home to my wife.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.498
You know how it is.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.061
<i>My</i> way!

06:45.271 --> 06:46.637
Watch out, Rainy!

06:46.706 --> 06:47.571
Aah!

06:47.640 --> 06:48.733
Aah! Uhp!

06:48.808 --> 06:51.039
Oof!

06:52.178 --> 06:53.271
Rainy!

06:53.346 --> 06:55.247
Whoops. Uh...

06:55.314 --> 06:57.249
Man... I'm real sorry.

06:57.316 --> 06:58.909
Yeah.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.511
No doi, friend.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.249
But... I can still help.

07:03.322 --> 07:04.620
I-I'll fix your house for you.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.216
Just get out of here!
Leave us alone!

07:07.293 --> 07:09.091

08:25.104 --> 08:28.336
but you won't have any,
because I never cry.

08:28.407 --> 08:29.773
I don't want them anymore.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.902
What? Stop lying!

08:31.978 --> 08:34.674
You're here for my
tears, aren't you?

08:34.746 --> 08:37.342
No. I hurt a small,
hairy man's wife.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.510
I just want to go home.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.520
You're just trying
to make me feel sad

08:41.587 --> 08:44.078
so you can steal my
tears when I cry,

08:44.155 --> 08:47.320
but I've got a heart
of stone, buddy.

08:47.393 --> 08:48.520
I'm evil!

08:48.594 --> 08:50.358
Dude! What's wrong with you?!

08:50.429 --> 08:52.364
I said I don't want your tears!

08:52.431 --> 08:54.024
You're lying!

08:54.100 --> 08:56.535
I'm not lying!

08:56.602 --> 08:58.503
You stink at lying.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.506
Ugh! Fine. Whatever, man.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.007
Have it your way.

09:02.074 --> 09:03.565
Okay...

09:03.643 --> 09:06.078
I <i>will</i> have it my way!

09:06.145 --> 09:08.410
Huh?

09:09.982 --> 09:14.215
Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you!

09:17.690 --> 09:19.124
Whoa. What?

09:20.359 --> 09:21.486
What?!

09:21.561 --> 09:23.052
I can't hear you!

09:23.129 --> 09:25.360
I said...

09:25.431 --> 09:27.195
<i>my</i> way!

09:27.266 --> 09:29.895
Aah! Aah! Aah!

09:33.239 --> 09:34.239
Huh?

09:34.307 --> 09:35.673
Magical teardrop.

09:39.745 --> 09:43.079
My way can still work!

09:43.149 --> 09:45.448
Yeah!

09:46.786 --> 09:48.015
Huh?

09:48.087 --> 09:49.020
I'm okay!

09:49.088 --> 09:52.149
Yay!

09:54.393 --> 09:56.385
Huh?

09:58.397 --> 10:00.025
Whoa!

10:00.099 --> 10:02.830
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

10:04.837 --> 10:05.668

10:16.849 --> 10:18.112
Huh?

10:22.822 --> 10:24.415
Have you come crawling back

10:24.490 --> 10:27.324
for your proper
treatment, babylips?

10:27.393 --> 10:28.691
- Yah!
- Ohh!

10:29.729 --> 10:31.220
Kiss that!

10:31.297 --> 10:34.267
Oh, my. You look
horribly injured.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.734
My kisses will heal you.

10:40.506 --> 10:42.634
Now, how does that feel?

10:42.708 --> 10:44.506
Bittersweet.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.911
Hey, man.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.211
You want me to heal your
toe with my magical goo?

10:50.282 --> 10:52.376
Ahh! No, thanks.

10:52.451 --> 10:55.512
I think the kisses work better.

10:55.588 --> 10:58.023
Excuse me! Don't stop!
Keep going, please.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.451
You're gross.
