00:00.083 --> 00:02.208
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.709 --> 00:04.834
<i>Carlos revealed his deepest desire.</i>

00:04.917 --> 00:07.458
It's about children. I want them so bad.

00:07.542 --> 00:09.041
<i>Tom forced the issue.</i>

00:09.125 --> 00:11.875
- Are you sleeping with my wife?
- Of course not.

00:11.959 --> 00:13.583
<i>Rick came clean.</i>

00:13.667 --> 00:15.041
I have feelings for you.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.542
I know you feel something for me.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.458
You can't work here any more.

00:19.542 --> 00:23.000
<i>And Susan's tortured love life...</i>

00:23.083 --> 00:24.709
I was on my way to propose to you.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.000
<i>- ...was finally...</i>
- What would you have said?

00:27.083 --> 00:28.750
<i>...on the mend.</i>

00:32.500 --> 00:34.667
<i>Exactly one year had passed</i>

00:34.750 --> 00:37.333
<i>since the night</i>
<i>Mike Delfino and Susan Mayer</i>

00:37.417 --> 00:41.083
<i>were supposed to become engaged.</i>

00:41.166 --> 00:45.083
<i>So when Mike took Susan</i>
<i>to her favourite restaurant,</i>

00:45.166 --> 00:49.291
<i>she just knew</i>
<i>he was going to pop the question.</i>

00:49.375 --> 00:51.083
What are you gonna have?

00:51.166 --> 00:53.375
<i>And when he did...</i>

00:53.458 --> 00:54.875
The chicken.

00:54.959 --> 00:57.625
<i>...she'd be ready with her answer.</i>

00:58.542 --> 01:01.750
<i>But as the evening wore on,</i>

01:01.834 --> 01:05.041
<i>the moment Susan</i>
<i>had been waiting for</i>

01:07.375 --> 01:09.333
<i>failed to materialise.</i>

01:14.792 --> 01:18.208
<i>And though many opportunities</i>
<i>presented themselves,</i>

01:22.125 --> 01:24.792
<i>the question was never asked.</i>

01:25.917 --> 01:29.041
<i>Until the thought</i>
<i>began to dawn on Susan</i>

01:29.125 --> 01:30.792
<i>that perhaps</i>

01:32.458 --> 01:34.250
<i>it never would.</i>

01:41.417 --> 01:44.000
Pretty quiet over there.
Was dinner okay?

01:44.083 --> 01:47.250
If by "okay" you mean uneventful,
then yes.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.500
- Something on your mind?
- Mike, what day is today?

01:52.458 --> 01:54.709
- Wednesday.
- Yes.

01:54.792 --> 01:59.041
It's also the anniversary of the day
we were supposed to get engaged.

01:59.125 --> 02:00.542
A year ago tonight,

02:00.625 --> 02:03.458
you were on your way
to ask me to marry you

02:03.583 --> 02:05.375
when you got hit by that stupid car.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.625
That was a year ago?
Time really flies.

02:10.333 --> 02:15.125
- Is that all you have to say?
- Why are you getting mad?

02:15.208 --> 02:17.250
I thought you were
gonna propose tonight!

02:17.333 --> 02:18.834
Susan, why would
I want to commemorate

02:18.917 --> 02:22.083
the anniversary of the night
that some maniac put me in a coma?

02:22.166 --> 02:25.125
Because this date
has special meaning for us.

02:25.208 --> 02:28.166
I sat in front of that trailer
for six hours

02:28.250 --> 02:29.750
thinking you hated me,

02:29.834 --> 02:33.000
and a proposal would have brought
the entire thing full circle.

02:33.083 --> 02:36.375
It would have turned a bad memory
into a beautiful one.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.375
You really thought this through,
didn't you?

02:38.458 --> 02:41.792
Yes, I did,
because I am a thoughtful person.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.208
And whenever we do get married,

02:43.291 --> 02:46.083
that is something
you are gonna have to work on.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.959
I'll do my best.

02:51.166 --> 02:54.917
By the way, that seem familiar?

03:03.542 --> 03:07.166
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that you did this.

03:07.250 --> 03:10.792
Well, I wanted to... How'd you put it?

03:10.875 --> 03:13.667
Turn a bad memory
into a beautiful one.

03:15.834 --> 03:18.291
Now go sit in front of that trailer.

03:18.834 --> 03:21.166
I promise I'll show up this time.

03:50.125 --> 03:55.000
<i>Yes, Susan knew Mike</i>
<i>was about to pop the question,</i>

03:55.083 --> 03:58.500
<i>the one she thought he'd never ask.</i>

03:58.583 --> 04:00.291
Oh, Mike.

04:00.375 --> 04:02.333
<i>And thanks to Susan...</i>

04:03.709 --> 04:05.542
Will you marry me?

04:05.625 --> 04:07.834
<i>...he never did.</i>

04:08.750 --> 04:12.166
<i>Luckily, it wasn't the question</i>
<i>she needed to hear...</i>

04:12.250 --> 04:17.542
I kind of had a speech prepared,
but sure, what the heck?

04:18.750 --> 04:20.792
<i>...it was the answer.</i>

04:32.458 --> 04:35.458
<i>From the moment we wake up</i>
<i>in the morning...</i>

04:35.542 --> 04:37.250
What time is it?

04:40.083 --> 04:42.709
<i>...till our head hits the</i>
<i>pillow at night...</i>

04:42.792 --> 04:45.000
Did you lock the front door?

04:46.375 --> 04:49.083
<i>...our lives are filled with questions.</i>

04:49.166 --> 04:51.959
Did you remember
to buy more shaving cream?

04:54.250 --> 04:56.542
<i>Simple ones that are easy to answer.</i>

04:56.625 --> 04:59.917
Can I still pull this look off? Yeah?

05:00.959 --> 05:04.583
<i>But some questions are so dangerous,</i>

05:04.667 --> 05:07.792
<i>the truth is not an option.</i>

05:17.000 --> 05:19.291
- Are you mad at Daddy?
- No.

05:20.792 --> 05:23.500
- Why would you think that?
-'Cause you're not talking to him.

05:23.583 --> 05:26.291
Well, when two people
have known each other

05:26.375 --> 05:29.875
as long as Mommy and Daddy have,
they don't have to always talk.

05:29.959 --> 05:33.542
In fact, a sign of a good relationship
is being comfortable in silence.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.750
That's true.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.375
Although, Mommy ignoring me
last night at work

05:36.458 --> 05:39.208
wasn't exactly what I'd call comfortable.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.417
Well, Daddy probably didn't notice

05:43.500 --> 05:46.125
that I was unloading
20-pound bags of flour

05:46.208 --> 05:47.500
'cause he still can't lift them.

05:47.583 --> 05:51.208
So Mommy didn't exactly have time
to sit around and chew the fat.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.917
Well, you haven't wanted
to chew the fat for five days now.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.500
Come on, Lynette.
Something's obviously bugging you.

05:56.583 --> 05:57.667
Wanna know what's bugging me?

05:57.750 --> 05:59.542
I'm trying to have a lovely breakfast
with my family

05:59.625 --> 06:02.208
- and you're picking a fight.
- Who's fighting? I just wanna talk.

06:02.291 --> 06:04.750
There's nothing to talk about, okay?
Just leave me alone.

06:04.834 --> 06:06.291
- Fine.
- Good.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.208
Sorry I asked.

06:11.041 --> 06:14.375
Hey, FranÃ§ois, it's Susan Mayer.
Call me as soon as you get this.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.875
I know I told you that my wedding is off,
but it's back on,

06:16.959 --> 06:20.000
and I wanna see if you're still available
to do the flowers. Bye.

06:20.083 --> 06:23.458
Oh, just so you know,
Ian's not the groom any more.

06:23.542 --> 06:25.375
Long story. Call me.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.333
There, I think I left messages
for everyone.

06:29.417 --> 06:32.625
Are you sure it's okay for us to have the
same wedding I was planning with Ian?

06:32.709 --> 06:33.917
Be honest.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.959
Well, I stole his bride,
I guess I can poach his florist.

06:38.041 --> 06:42.041
Gosh, I just keep thinking
there's someone I've forgotten to tell.

06:42.125 --> 06:44.959
Caterer, band, florist...

06:45.041 --> 06:48.959
- Guests?
- Oh, my God!

06:49.041 --> 06:52.000
- I had Julie call and cancel everyone.
- Just call them back.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.291
You can't invite people to a wedding
on the phone.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.959
You have to send a proper invitation.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.834
You want people to think
I'm a complete flake?

06:59.917 --> 07:02.792
Hi, Curt. Susan Mayer.
You did my wedding invitations?

07:02.875 --> 07:04.500
I'm gonna need another batch.

07:04.583 --> 07:05.709
Exactly the same,

07:05.792 --> 07:08.417
only change the name
"Ian Hainsworth" to "Mike Delfino."

07:08.500 --> 07:10.500
Long story. Call me.

07:20.625 --> 07:22.125
Hey, what's with the frown?

07:22.208 --> 07:23.834
You trying to get wrinkles
before the wedding?

07:23.917 --> 07:26.667
No, I can't find a good flower girl.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.834
Lynette keeps hinting
for me to use Penny,

07:28.917 --> 07:30.625
but I saw her
in that pre-school sing-along,

07:30.709 --> 07:33.333
and I am sorry,
but we are talking zero charisma.

07:33.417 --> 07:34.959
You know, I had a thought
about the flower girl.

07:35.041 --> 07:36.208
You did?

07:36.291 --> 07:39.417
My cleaning lady has a daughter.
Where's that picture?

07:42.166 --> 07:43.959
Look familiar?

07:44.041 --> 07:46.667
Oh, my God, she looks just like me
when I was that age.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.291
Yeah, that's what I thought.
See, this way, the wedding procession

07:49.375 --> 07:51.583
starts with you
as this beautiful little girl,

07:51.667 --> 07:54.917
ends with you as
the stunning bride that you've become.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.959
I love that you're so into this wedding.

07:58.041 --> 08:00.917
Most men would be like, "Yeah, yeah.
Tell me where the church is."

08:01.000 --> 08:03.333
But you're as obsessed as me.

08:03.417 --> 08:06.917
You're like a hot groom and
a gay best friend all rolled into one.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.208
Well, can you blame me for wanting
to make everything as perfect as you?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.291
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

08:18.417 --> 08:22.375
It must've been a bad scallop
in that paella last night.

08:22.458 --> 08:26.709
You'd think that half-bottle of tequila
you drank would've disinfected it.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.667
Oh, sorry to interrupt.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.834
I'm just moving some stuff
over to Susan's house.

08:32.917 --> 08:36.625
- You two shacking up now?
- Actually, we're getting married.

08:37.542 --> 08:40.667
- You're kidding! Congratulations!
- Thanks.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.208
You don't waste any time.

08:42.291 --> 08:43.917
Well, you know,
I've already wasted a year.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.875
I don't want to wake up one more day
without her lying next to me.

08:46.959 --> 08:50.458
Oh, God.
Here comes what's left of breakfast.

08:50.542 --> 08:52.750
And you two better be careful.

08:52.834 --> 08:56.375
All this wedding fever going around,
you might catch it.

08:58.291 --> 09:00.166
Yeah, right.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.792
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.041
I didn't realise
the concept of our being married

09:07.125 --> 09:08.709
was such a thigh-slapper.

09:08.792 --> 09:10.667
Come on, Edie.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.625
Look, it's way too soon
for us to be talking marriage.

09:12.709 --> 09:13.917
We only just started dating.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.250
Well, I know,
but we could live together.

09:18.333 --> 09:22.166
We're either at my house
or your house every night anyway.

09:22.250 --> 09:24.417
Yeah, true, but...

09:24.500 --> 09:25.875
Well, why not?

09:25.959 --> 09:28.208
I mean, we're not kids any more,
Carlos.

09:28.291 --> 09:31.417
And, I mean, I really care about you.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.542
Don't you care about me?

09:33.625 --> 09:35.792
Of course I do.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.959
But...
I just took over Mike's lease yesterday.

09:39.041 --> 09:42.041
Oh, please.
Old lady Sims can find another tenant.

09:42.125 --> 09:46.250
Edie, I already signed the papers.
Look, I have a responsibility.

09:46.333 --> 09:49.041
You know, that rent
helps pay for her nursing home.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.917
You understand, right?

10:01.333 --> 10:03.458
Mrs Sims?

10:03.542 --> 10:06.041
Edie? Edie Britt?

10:06.125 --> 10:10.291
- Hi! Are you up for a visit?
- Well, of course!

10:10.375 --> 10:13.917
What a nice surprise.
I haven't seen you for years.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.834
Oh, I know, and I feel awful about that.

10:17.917 --> 10:20.250
I have always liked you so much.

10:20.333 --> 10:23.125
You know, Wisteria Lane
hasn't been the same since you left.

10:23.208 --> 10:26.834
Well, with my arthritis,
I just couldn't live alone any more.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.625
But what I get from renting
more than pays for this place.

10:29.709 --> 10:31.750
Oh, well, that's good.

10:31.834 --> 10:34.291
Although, with Mike Delfino
getting married,

10:34.375 --> 10:35.750
your house is gonna be empty now.

10:35.834 --> 10:39.000
Actually, no.
A friend of Mike's just signed a lease.

10:39.083 --> 10:42.125
A very nice man. What was his name?

10:45.375 --> 10:47.000
Carlos Solis.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.083
- Oh, dear.
- What?

10:51.250 --> 10:52.959
What did Mike tell you about Carlos?

10:53.041 --> 10:56.166
Oh, just that
he's a nice, responsible man.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.709
Oh, well, he is when he's sober.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.333
He has a drinking problem?

11:02.417 --> 11:06.375
Well, actually, what I heard is...

11:06.458 --> 11:10.917
Oh, what am I doing?
I shouldn't be indulging in idle gossip.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.041
- Edie, please!
- Smack. He does smack.

11:14.583 --> 11:17.041
What? Good heavens.

11:17.125 --> 11:20.583
Oh, well, he seemed such a nice man
when I met him.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.291
And he's got a good job.

11:22.375 --> 11:27.041
I know. What is that term?
"Functional junkie."

11:27.125 --> 11:31.583
This is very upsetting.
Maybe I should rethink this.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.333
No! I should learn
to shut my big mouth.

11:34.417 --> 11:38.000
I mean, here I am blathering on
about drugs and prostitutes...

11:38.083 --> 11:41.542
Prostitutes? You never said anything
about prostitutes.

11:41.625 --> 11:43.875
And I'm not going to.

11:43.959 --> 11:47.834
Frankly, I don't want to be
on his bad side.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.917
Edie, I can't have someone like that
in my house.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.208
- I have to tear up this lease.
- Oh, no, I can't let you do that.

11:55.291 --> 11:57.959
Not with your arthritis.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.333
Here, you let me.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.333
- Gabby!
- Oh, Susan!

12:09.417 --> 12:12.333
Julie told me about Ian. I am so sorry.

12:12.417 --> 12:15.542
You must be devastated.

12:15.625 --> 12:16.875
Hey, Gabby.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.792
I see you've picked up the pieces.

12:19.875 --> 12:22.625
We got engaged last night.
We're getting married!

12:22.709 --> 12:25.500
Oh, my God! Congratulations!

12:25.583 --> 12:27.542
So forget what Julie told you
about the wedding being off.

12:27.625 --> 12:31.542
- It's back on.
- Really? Same day?

12:31.625 --> 12:34.000
Yep, I promised people a wedding
and they are getting one.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.959
Well, I'm sorry, I can't make it.
I have plans that day.

12:37.041 --> 12:40.667
- Oh, you could change your plans.
- No, I really can't.

12:40.750 --> 12:44.000
Well, what could be more important
to you than my wedding?

12:44.917 --> 12:48.083
- My wedding?
- What?

12:48.166 --> 12:50.875
Oh, I see you got the invitation.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.333
You're getting married
on my wedding day?

12:54.417 --> 12:57.333
Well, you cancelled,
and Victor was kind of in a rush

12:57.417 --> 13:00.083
because he didn't think it looked good
for the mayor to be shacking up.

13:00.166 --> 13:02.458
And every date we tried,
someone had a conflict.

13:02.542 --> 13:03.792
And then your date opened up,

13:03.875 --> 13:05.959
and we knew all my friends
were available,

13:06.041 --> 13:08.583
and well, you know, you, too.

13:08.667 --> 13:12.333
It's really no problem.
We'll find another date.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.500
Gabby, did you really think
I would want to spend

13:14.583 --> 13:18.375
what would've been my wedding day
watching someone else get married?

13:18.458 --> 13:21.375
I am so throwing that bouquet to you.

13:21.458 --> 13:24.375
- Okay, if you think for one second...
- It's fine, really.

13:24.458 --> 13:27.166
Come on, Susan.
We've got some calls to make.

13:27.250 --> 13:31.375
Oh, right.
I have to cancel my wedding. Again!

13:43.959 --> 13:45.291
Susan, hi.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.959
- Is this a bad time?
- I'm kind of in the middle of something.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.583
Okay, well, I just wanted to say

13:49.667 --> 13:51.625
that I'm sorry
for getting so snippy yesterday.

13:51.709 --> 13:54.166
That when I cancelled my wedding,
you had every right to...

13:54.250 --> 13:58.500
- Susan? Susan? Is that my Susan?
- FranÃ§ois.

13:58.583 --> 14:02.000
I am so sorry that I could not do
your wedding flowers.

14:02.083 --> 14:06.875
But the moment you cancelled,
your friend here she... How you say?

14:06.959 --> 14:08.500
"Scoop me up."

14:11.625 --> 14:15.500
- You stole my florist?
- Only because I admire your taste.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.709
It's not theft, it's an homage.

14:17.792 --> 14:21.500
I have left the bouquet
and the centrepiece on the table.

14:21.583 --> 14:25.333
If there are any changes,
you let me know. <i>Au revoir.</i>

14:29.208 --> 14:30.834
Well, I gotta go.

14:33.208 --> 14:35.208
I wanna see those flowers.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.583
Oh, my God! That's my centrepiece!

14:40.667 --> 14:43.500
Oh, what? Now you suddenly have
the trademark on peach tulips?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.709
In this town, in wedding season,
yeah, I do!

14:45.792 --> 14:48.458
You might as well have used
my caterer and my swing band!

14:48.542 --> 14:51.208
- Yeah, listen, about that...
- Oh, my God!

14:51.291 --> 14:54.750
- Did you steal my whole wedding?
- It was short notice, okay?

14:54.834 --> 14:57.250
These people are booked
months in advance.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.750
The only people available
were the ones you just bailed on.

14:59.834 --> 15:03.291
Gabby, I spent months
planning that wedding!

15:03.375 --> 15:07.709
Oh, I see what you're getting at,
and you know what, you are right.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.875
You have been
my de facto wedding planner

15:09.959 --> 15:11.834
and you deserve to get paid.

15:11.917 --> 15:15.041
All right. What's the going rate?
Seven thousand? Eight?

15:15.125 --> 15:18.375
- Gabby!
- All right, 10. I'm not gonna haggle.

15:18.458 --> 15:22.333
I don't want to be paid.
I want my wedding back.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.041
Well, you can't have it.

15:24.125 --> 15:27.291
And if you ask me,
I am doing you a really big favour.

15:27.375 --> 15:28.583
Excuse me?

15:28.667 --> 15:31.667
You are rushing into
this marriage thing way too fast.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.083
Why don't you give it some time

15:33.166 --> 15:35.000
and see if you and Mike
work as a couple?

15:35.083 --> 15:36.291
I'm rushing?

15:36.375 --> 15:39.583
You met Victor three months ago.
I've known Mike three years.

15:39.667 --> 15:42.000
Yeah, on and off. Mostly off!

15:42.083 --> 15:43.917
What if you tie the knot in a month,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.625
and realise that you miss Ian
and Mike misses the coma?

15:48.959 --> 15:51.709
I cannot believe that you just said that.

15:51.792 --> 15:53.792
Okay, you know what?

15:53.875 --> 15:56.291
I came over here
to give you my response card,

15:56.375 --> 15:59.750
but here, this is my response!

16:02.417 --> 16:05.125
You don't mean that.
That's just a big dramatic gesture.

16:05.208 --> 16:08.417
Oh, no, no,
this is a big dramatic gesture!

16:09.500 --> 16:13.500
- My flowers!
- No, they're my flowers!

16:14.625 --> 16:16.875
Enjoy your stolen wedding!

16:22.625 --> 16:24.792
You can't do this! I just signed a lease!

16:24.875 --> 16:27.792
I'm sorry. The law says my mom
has 72 hours to change her mind.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.875
She's exercising that option.

16:35.792 --> 16:39.458
- Hey, what's going on?
- I've been evicted.

16:39.542 --> 16:41.417
- What?
- Yeah. That was Mrs Sims' kid.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.250
She's giving me 24 hours
to move out of her house.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.834
- That is so weird.
- It gets weirder.

16:46.917 --> 16:50.500
He told me Mrs Sims
is praying for my spiritual recovery.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.417
Oh, well, when old folks
see the end coming,

16:54.500 --> 16:55.750
they get all religious.

16:55.834 --> 16:57.291
I guess.

16:58.583 --> 17:01.083
So, mind if I crash with you
until I can find a new place?

17:01.166 --> 17:02.625
- Of course not.
- Thanks.

17:02.709 --> 17:04.709
- I'll bring my stuff over in the morning.
- Oh, why wait?

17:04.792 --> 17:08.500
I've got boxes in the garage.
I'll help you start packing now.

17:10.750 --> 17:14.375
Edie, did you have something
to do with this?

17:14.458 --> 17:15.959
What?

17:16.041 --> 17:18.333
You have to admit,
it is kind of a coincidence.

17:18.417 --> 17:21.000
You ask me to move in,
I say no, I get evicted.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.792
How dare you?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.834
I offer to put a roof over your head

17:24.917 --> 17:27.667
and you repay me
with suspicions and insults?

17:27.750 --> 17:30.041
I don't even know
that I want you in my house.

17:30.125 --> 17:33.291
- Fine. I'll get a motel.
- Oh, whoa! Hold on!

17:33.375 --> 17:36.542
- Let's not be hasty.
- I knew it.

17:36.625 --> 17:39.083
You were behind this.

17:39.166 --> 17:44.834
Okay, if you want to fight, fine.
But let's talk about the real issue here.

17:44.917 --> 17:47.500
I mean, why are you so reluctant
to make a commitment to me?

17:47.583 --> 17:49.375
I told you,
I don't want to talk about this.

17:49.458 --> 17:52.417
Well, you never do,
but you owe me an explanation.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.291
I mean, why don't you
want to move in with me?

17:54.375 --> 17:56.417
Because I'm not in love with you.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.500
Edie, I'm sorry.

18:02.583 --> 18:06.125
- I really like you, I...
- No, I get it.

18:06.208 --> 18:09.000
It's just a little upsetting because

18:11.417 --> 18:12.792
I'm late.

18:16.792 --> 18:18.750
Edie, you can't be pregnant.
You're on the pill.

18:18.834 --> 18:21.375
Yeah, well, I might've
forgotten to take it a couple of days.

18:21.458 --> 18:24.291
And I've been nauseous
for an entire week.

18:24.375 --> 18:26.959
So I went and got a pregnancy test.

18:30.041 --> 18:33.709
I figure I should find out
if I'm carrying your love child.

18:33.792 --> 18:36.375
Oh, wait, my mistake.

18:36.458 --> 18:38.875
Your "like" child.

18:54.750 --> 18:59.166
- So? What does it say?
- It's gonna take a couple more minutes.

19:05.625 --> 19:09.125
I just peed on that.
For God's sake, put it on a coaster.

19:14.125 --> 19:17.041
Oh, this is just dandy.

19:17.125 --> 19:20.166
I'm 40, single and knocked up.

19:20.250 --> 19:23.291
But on the bright side,
the dad's not into me.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.125
Edie, if you are pregnant,

19:26.208 --> 19:28.166
I'm not gonna let you
go through this alone.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.083
So what?
You're gonna be my Lamaze partner?

19:31.166 --> 19:35.041
No. I'm saying I'll step up.
I'll be there to help you raise him.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.417
You serious?

19:38.500 --> 19:41.834
Hey, I was there practically every day
to help you with Travers.

19:41.917 --> 19:45.542
What makes you think that I would
do any less if it were actually my child?

19:46.458 --> 19:49.875
Well, thanks. That's nice to know.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.250
You know,

19:57.583 --> 20:01.834
your spare bedroom
would make a great nursery.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.500
Yeah, I guess it would.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.083
I mean, it's right down
the hall from the master.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.834
So we'd be able to hear him
when he was crying.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.208
We?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.125
You'd move in?

20:16.208 --> 20:18.458
I told you that I would be here for you.

20:18.542 --> 20:22.375
We could even decorate his room in,
like, a whole pirate theme.

20:22.458 --> 20:25.333
I always wanted to do that
if I had a son.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.834
You know what would be really cool?

20:28.917 --> 20:32.959
To decorate his bed
like a ship with a sail and a mast...

20:33.041 --> 20:36.875
Carlos, it's negative.

20:41.959 --> 20:43.208
Oh.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.375
Well, that's a relief, huh?

20:53.417 --> 20:54.542
Yeah.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.291
We really dodged a bullet.

20:59.583 --> 21:04.208
So, let's celebrate, have a drink.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.917
Oh, and by the way,
you're still welcome to stay

21:10.000 --> 21:11.792
till you find a place.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.667
That's nice of you.

21:14.625 --> 21:15.917
Thanks.

21:26.917 --> 21:29.417
I cannot thank you enough
for doing this.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.542
Thanks for taking the time
out of your day.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.500
Yeah, Tom, I'm not sure
this is the best approach.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.917
I mean, I've never done a session
before where half of the couple

21:36.000 --> 21:37.667
didn't know
I was a marriage counsellor.

21:37.750 --> 21:38.875
We'll tell her.

21:38.959 --> 21:41.875
Eventually.
I just don't want to scare her off.

21:41.959 --> 21:43.667
- Hey, Lynette.
- Yeah?

21:43.750 --> 21:46.875
Look who just walked in off the street.
Scott McKinney. Remember?

21:46.959 --> 21:49.291
We pledged Alpha Tau together.
I told you about him.

21:49.375 --> 21:52.125
You won the beer pong championship.

21:52.208 --> 21:53.333
You told her about that?

21:53.417 --> 21:55.041
Yeah, and then you threw up
in the trophy.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.583
Look, that is far from
his only accomplishment.

21:57.667 --> 22:00.208
- He's got a PhD.
- Oh, wow.

22:00.291 --> 22:02.667
Well, I'd love to chat,
but I have cheese to grate.

22:02.750 --> 22:06.083
Wait. Honey, no, wait, please.
I will do that later.

22:06.166 --> 22:10.000
I want you guys to know each other.

22:10.083 --> 22:13.583
I mean, this guy, he's my boy.

22:16.875 --> 22:19.709
So, Scott got married
the same year that we did.

22:19.792 --> 22:21.667
How's your wife liking Fairview?

22:21.750 --> 22:25.750
Well, her whole family's back east,
so she kind of resisted the move.

22:25.834 --> 22:28.792
Really?
So that was a source of conflict?

22:28.875 --> 22:30.875
Yes, well,
all couples have their conflicts.

22:30.959 --> 22:32.750
I'm sure you've had your share.

22:32.834 --> 22:36.208
- Oh, sure, now and then.
- Emphasis on "now."

22:36.291 --> 22:38.750
- Tom.
- Look, Scott shared with us.

22:38.834 --> 22:40.917
We're going through
kind of a rough patch.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.667
I see. Well, I'm sure it's something
you will get through.

22:43.750 --> 22:46.417
The trick is to keep
those lines of communication open.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.333
Boy, easier said than done.

22:49.417 --> 22:51.750
So, this rough patch,

22:51.834 --> 22:54.834
what would you say
is the underlying issue there?

22:57.667 --> 23:02.333
Well, Scott, I'm not sure I would say.
Particularly not to someone I just met.

23:02.417 --> 23:03.667
He's just trying to help.

23:03.750 --> 23:07.417
If you ask me, I'd say it started
when our manager, Rick, quit.

23:08.500 --> 23:11.291
Okay and how did
that make you feel, Lynette?

23:12.291 --> 23:16.959
I am not answering that.
This is not a therapy session.

23:17.041 --> 23:20.125
But if it were, what would you say?

23:25.417 --> 23:29.333
- Oh, dear God, you didn't.
- What? Didn't what?

23:29.417 --> 23:31.083
Okay, give it up, Tom.

23:31.166 --> 23:34.667
Yes, yes, Lynette.
I am a couples counsellor.

23:34.750 --> 23:37.208
Really? And what do you call this,
"ambush therapy"?

23:37.291 --> 23:38.667
Look, it was my idea.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.542
Look, I'm just trying to get you
to talk about what is going on.

23:41.625 --> 23:43.458
And don't tell me
that nothing's going on!

23:43.542 --> 23:45.834
Good, good.
All our cards are on the table.

23:45.917 --> 23:47.291
Cram it!

23:47.375 --> 23:50.083
Okay, yeah, Tom,
I've been unhappy lately.

23:50.166 --> 23:51.792
I am working through some issues,

23:51.875 --> 23:53.959
but that is something
I need to do on my own.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.250
Talking about it doesn't help,

23:55.333 --> 23:58.417
not to you,
and certainly not to Dr Beer Pong!

24:03.250 --> 24:07.458
Well, I'm billing you for a whole hour,
so is there anything else on your mind?

24:09.959 --> 24:12.834
I mean, I'm sorry, but this time,
Gabby has just crossed the line,

24:12.917 --> 24:15.709
and I will not make myself
sit through her wedding.

24:15.792 --> 24:17.583
Julie thinks I'm overreacting.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.333
You don't think I'm overreacting,
do you?

24:19.417 --> 24:21.375
- Yeah, a little.
- Absolutely not.

24:23.041 --> 24:24.166
What? She asked.

24:24.250 --> 24:27.083
Look, even if Gabby
is in the wrong here,

24:27.166 --> 24:30.458
and she is hugely, hideously wrong,

24:30.542 --> 24:32.917
do you really wanna
boycott her wedding?

24:33.000 --> 24:36.625
She said that I would make Mike
wish he was back in a coma.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.583
I think her point,

24:38.667 --> 24:41.291
and again I wish she'd express
herself a little more tactfully,

24:41.375 --> 24:43.250
was that marriage is unpredictable.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.208
We can't know what it'll be
until we're in it.

24:45.291 --> 24:47.834
Don't defend that self-centred brat.

24:47.917 --> 24:50.750
She steals Susan's wedding
and then expects to stay friends.

24:50.834 --> 24:54.458
She divorces Carlos and
doesn't want anyone else to date him.

24:54.542 --> 24:58.583
I've never known anyone
as dishonest and manipulative.

24:58.667 --> 25:00.875
Speaking of Carlos,
I hear he got evicted.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.875
Yeah, that was a real shocker.

25:02.959 --> 25:06.959
Anyway, you stick to your guns
and don't you dare go to that wedding.

25:07.041 --> 25:11.166
It could ruin your friendship.
Are you willing to take that chance?

25:11.250 --> 25:14.041
- No, I guess not.
- Wuss.

25:16.083 --> 25:20.667
Well, at least get her a thoughtless,
crappy gift, like a blender.

25:20.750 --> 25:23.709
I got you a blender for Christmas.

25:23.792 --> 25:26.792
And I use it every day. Gotta go.

25:48.959 --> 25:52.083
Honey, I am so sorry.
I hope you don't hate me.

25:52.166 --> 25:54.959
I don't. I was just on my way
to apologise to you.

25:55.041 --> 25:56.458
Just so you know,
I changed all my flowers.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.542
- You don't have to.
- The hell I don't.

25:58.625 --> 26:01.125
Those peach tulips belong to you.

26:01.834 --> 26:03.500
And so do these.

26:04.250 --> 26:07.166
Thank you. I was just bringing you this.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.583
Well, we got chocolate and wine.

26:09.667 --> 26:12.166
- Your place or mine?
- Oh, well...

26:14.291 --> 26:17.083
I am so glad we're doing this.
I hate it when we fight.

26:17.166 --> 26:20.458
Me, too. And I'm so sorry
about that comment I made about Mike.

26:20.542 --> 26:21.875
It was way out of line.

26:21.959 --> 26:24.208
You guys are gonna be
insanely happy.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.959
I think so, too.

26:26.041 --> 26:27.792
But, you know, then I remember

26:27.875 --> 26:29.792
that's what I thought
about me and Karl.

26:29.875 --> 26:31.875
Please, Mike is not Karl.

26:31.959 --> 26:35.709
Well, you know, when I married him,
Karl wasn't Karl.

26:35.792 --> 26:38.583
And I think that's why
I got so mad at you.

26:38.667 --> 26:42.917
Because 99% of me is sure
that we're gonna be totally happy,

26:43.000 --> 26:46.875
but then what you said,
it just stirred up that pesky 1%.

26:46.959 --> 26:49.542
Honey, please.
If anyone should be nervous, it's me.

26:49.625 --> 26:53.250
I met Victor three months ago.
I mean, I'm crazy about him.

26:53.333 --> 26:57.375
It's just the thought
of saying those vows again, it's scary.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.458
Lynette is right.

26:59.542 --> 27:03.959
You know, marriage is like...
It's like these bonbons.

27:04.041 --> 27:08.291
You never know what you're getting
until you're in the middle of it.

27:08.375 --> 27:11.291
It's one of those hard, jelly ones.

27:11.375 --> 27:12.750
Do you think that's an omen?

27:12.834 --> 27:15.542
Honey, you're gonna be okay, all right?

27:15.625 --> 27:17.333
We're gonna help each other
through this.

27:17.417 --> 27:19.417
Right. Yeah.

27:20.333 --> 27:25.250
I mean, getting married is scary,
but at least we'll be doing it together.

27:27.625 --> 27:30.750
Oh, my God! We should totally do that.

27:30.834 --> 27:33.709
- What?
- Get married, together!

27:33.792 --> 27:35.500
You and me?

27:35.583 --> 27:38.792
Oh, well, I'm beyond flattered.

27:38.875 --> 27:41.000
I find you to be
an incredibly attractive woman. I just...

27:41.083 --> 27:44.959
Oh, no, stupid.
I mean a double wedding.

27:45.625 --> 27:49.000
Oh. Oh! Oh, I would love that!

27:49.083 --> 27:50.959
I know! And then you wouldn't be
mad at me for the date,

27:51.041 --> 27:52.333
and I wouldn't feel guilty!

27:52.417 --> 27:55.291
- And we could be brides together!
- Together!

27:56.500 --> 28:00.000
Oh, yes! Let's celebrate!
More chocolate!

28:01.875 --> 28:05.166
And just so you know,
if I was a lesbian, I'd totally do you.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.208
That's good to know.

28:14.542 --> 28:17.291
<i>It's a fact of life that brides-to-be</i>

28:17.375 --> 28:19.875
<i>who agree to double weddings</i>
<i>late at night,</i>

28:19.959 --> 28:23.291
<i>often feel differently come the dawn.</i>

28:24.166 --> 28:28.458
<i>This change of heart was certainly true</i>
<i>in the case of Susan Mayer.</i>

28:30.250 --> 28:31.917
<i>And even more so</i>

28:33.083 --> 28:35.208
<i>for Gabrielle Solis.</i>

28:37.417 --> 28:39.625
- Morning.
- Hi, honey.

28:39.709 --> 28:44.208
I hope I didn't wake you last night.
I was at Susan's till midnight.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.500
- Something wrong?
- No. Not exactly.

28:46.583 --> 28:50.750
Just a small change of plans
about the wedding.

28:50.834 --> 28:53.125
What kind of change?

28:53.208 --> 28:58.875
See, Susan was really upset.

28:59.583 --> 29:02.959
I mean, I've never seen Gabby
so torn up with guilt.

29:03.041 --> 29:06.250
Practically in tears
over this whole wedding date thing.

29:06.333 --> 29:10.000
And she kept saying,
"Please, let me make it up to you."

29:10.083 --> 29:13.458
So after an hour of this,
I suddenly heard myself say...

29:13.542 --> 29:15.750
"Hey, how about a double wedding?"

29:15.834 --> 29:18.417
Wanted to bite my tongue
the minute it came out.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.750
She's so excited, so needy.

29:20.834 --> 29:23.375
Jumping up and down
and hugging me.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.709
I mean, what could I say?

29:24.792 --> 29:26.875
So, we're kind of stuck.

29:27.959 --> 29:30.041
So, what do you think?

29:30.125 --> 29:33.417
I think anything that makes you happy
is fine by me.

29:33.500 --> 29:37.834
- Will this make you happy?
- No! I'm screwed!

29:37.917 --> 29:41.542
I cannot get out of this
without hurting her feelings.

29:41.625 --> 29:44.959
Maybe this will help. I forbid it.

29:45.041 --> 29:46.291
- You do?
- Sure.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.500
Tell her that your groom's
an old-fashioned guy,

29:48.583 --> 29:51.834
and he doesn't wanna see anybody
on that altar but his bride.

29:51.917 --> 29:55.083
If she gets mad,
have her take it up with me.

29:55.166 --> 29:59.917
So this is what marriage is about,
having someone to hide behind.

30:02.375 --> 30:04.875
- So what do you think?
- You're gonna have to undo this.

30:04.959 --> 30:07.875
How? Look, I know
I shouldn't have offered, but I did.

30:07.959 --> 30:10.041
- I can't just take it back.
- Well, you're gonna have to.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.000
Do you have any idea
what this day means to me?

30:12.083 --> 30:16.041
I do. And I know you've worked really
hard to make our wedding perfect.

30:16.125 --> 30:17.709
Exactly. Do you think I want to share it

30:17.792 --> 30:21.542
with your friend
and her ex-convict fiancÃ©?

30:21.625 --> 30:24.834
- That's your problem?
- Gabby, I'm the mayor of this town.

30:24.917 --> 30:26.709
How's it gonna look?
There'll be press there.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.709
- Press? At our wedding?
- Well, we're public figures.

30:29.792 --> 30:32.417
So all of this planning
and attention to detail,

30:32.500 --> 30:35.041
- that's all been about your image?
- Of course not.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.917
Gabby, this is gonna be
the proudest day of my life.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.041
And I'm not sharing
the spotlight with anyone.

30:40.125 --> 30:41.959
How about the bride?

30:42.041 --> 30:45.625
Oh, please, every eye in that place
is gonna be on you.

30:45.709 --> 30:48.542
Every woman will wish they were you,
every guy will wish they had you.

30:48.625 --> 30:50.250
It's gonna be great.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.709
Tell your friends you're sorry.

30:52.792 --> 30:55.041
Tell them I'll even pay
for their wedding.

30:55.125 --> 30:57.125
But they're not sharing mine.

31:04.375 --> 31:08.333
Here's a one-bedroom at The Oaks
with a view of the golf course.

31:08.417 --> 31:10.000
That's gonna go fast.

31:10.083 --> 31:13.583
You know, I'm gonna call on this
first thing in the morning.

31:13.667 --> 31:18.500
Or, I know this is the last thing
you'd expect to hear from me,

31:18.583 --> 31:24.000
but what if you stayed here with me
and we tried to have a baby?

31:29.083 --> 31:30.375
Are you serious?

31:30.458 --> 31:35.000
I saw the look on your face
when that test came back negative.

31:35.083 --> 31:38.375
Admit it, you were disappointed.

31:40.417 --> 31:45.959
- Yeah, maybe a little.
- Well, so was I.

31:46.041 --> 31:48.834
- You were?
- Yeah, I was.

31:48.917 --> 31:54.166
You know, having Travers here made
me realise that I like being a mom.

31:54.250 --> 31:58.250
And you were so great with him.
Well, think.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.041
We could have that all the time.

32:02.917 --> 32:06.667
Edie, nobody wants a kid
more than me. It's just...

32:06.750 --> 32:09.709
Yeah, yeah, we're not
head over heels in love.

32:10.709 --> 32:12.875
We like each other, right?

32:13.792 --> 32:17.959
I mean, that's more than
a lot of parents have going for them.

32:18.041 --> 32:23.417
- It's just a very big step.
- Carlos, look around.

32:23.500 --> 32:28.083
Everyone's taking big steps.
Gabby and Victor, Susan and Mike.

32:28.166 --> 32:30.166
This could be our step.

32:31.875 --> 32:34.667
We both need to love someone.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.834
No one said it had to be each other.

32:43.166 --> 32:45.000
Just think about it.

33:02.667 --> 33:04.166
Let's do it.

33:09.709 --> 33:12.125
- You really want to?
- Yeah.

33:13.667 --> 33:16.542
I'm tired of waiting for my life to start.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.208
Oh, Carlos.

33:19.542 --> 33:23.834
Imagine, with your genes and mine,
that child is gonna be a knockout.

33:26.333 --> 33:27.875
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

33:27.959 --> 33:32.000
I'm gonna flush those birth control
pills and we're gonna get cracking.

33:48.250 --> 33:51.041
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:59.583 --> 34:02.375
- How are you doing?
- Good.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.208
Listen, we need to talk.

34:04.291 --> 34:06.834
I spoke to Mike

34:06.917 --> 34:10.500
and he's just not really
into the whole double wedding thing.

34:10.583 --> 34:11.875
Mike said no?

34:11.959 --> 34:14.917
Yeah, he sort of wants the day
just to be about us.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.875
So we're gonna wait till the fall.
I'm so sorry.

34:17.959 --> 34:19.542
No, no, it's okay.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.667
Victor was kind of
on the fence about it, too.

34:21.750 --> 34:24.500
Oh, good!
I mean, not that they said no, just...

34:24.583 --> 34:26.458
-'Cause I really wanted to do it.
- Me, too.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.583
I think it would have been so much fun.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.625
- Yeah.
- Well, I gotta go.

34:31.709 --> 34:34.959
- I gotta meet FranÃ§ois.
- See you.

34:35.041 --> 34:37.041
Oh, by the way,

34:37.125 --> 34:39.750
you know that 1%
sliver of a doubt thing I told you about?

34:39.834 --> 34:43.583
Totally gone. Any question
I had about Mike's been answered.

34:45.709 --> 34:47.667
That must feel really great.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.458
Yeah.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.667
- I feel really good about this.
- I do, too.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Our friends are probably
gonna make fun of us.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.250
Yeah, I'm sure.

35:05.333 --> 35:08.000
But who cares. It's gonna be great.

35:08.083 --> 35:10.166
I'm so happy
we're gonna be living together.

35:10.250 --> 35:13.250
We're gonna have so much fun.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.041
I'll be right out.

35:46.333 --> 35:50.041
Okay, let's make a baby.

36:07.625 --> 36:11.125
- I talked to my back doctor today.
- Oh, what did he have to say?

36:11.208 --> 36:15.375
He said, assuming
I exercise reasonable caution,

36:15.458 --> 36:17.667
I can have sex again.

36:17.750 --> 36:19.875
And what would that
have to do with me?

36:19.959 --> 36:23.000
Well, you don't seem to
want to talk to me these days,

36:23.083 --> 36:27.458
so I figured it's the one thing that
we can do together without speaking.

36:29.750 --> 36:32.625
Remember when I was giving birth
to the twins and screaming in agony

36:32.709 --> 36:35.000
because Porter was
dragging my uterus out with him?

36:35.083 --> 36:39.542
Well, I was more in the
mood for sex then than I am now.

36:39.625 --> 36:41.417
Lynette. I'm your husband.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.375
I have to find a way
to connect to you somehow.

36:44.458 --> 36:47.709
So we can have sex or we can talk.

36:49.917 --> 36:51.291
Your call.

36:53.542 --> 36:55.500
Fine. Let's have sex.

36:55.583 --> 36:57.583
- What?
- Yeah, let's get this off.

36:57.667 --> 37:00.250
What, you would rather
have sex with me than talk to me?

37:00.333 --> 37:03.041
- Yep.
- Ow! Ow! That hurts!

37:03.125 --> 37:05.250
I said I'd have sex.
I didn't say I'd make love.

37:05.333 --> 37:07.959
Huh, you wanna play rough?
'Cause I can play rough!

37:08.041 --> 37:09.375
Cut it out!

37:09.458 --> 37:12.083
Sorry, I'll try to be gentler
as I move down south.

37:12.166 --> 37:13.709
Okay, okay.

37:15.792 --> 37:19.375
Okay, fine! You are mad at me!

37:19.458 --> 37:22.417
But name one thing
that I have done to deserve it!

37:22.500 --> 37:25.375
You had lunch with Rick.

37:25.458 --> 37:28.250
You're damn right I did!
I saw the security tape.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.417
What was I supposed to do?
Pretend that nothing was going on?

37:31.500 --> 37:33.542
Nothing was going on.
He never touched me.

37:33.625 --> 37:36.458
And I wasn't gonna sit around
and wait until he did.

37:36.542 --> 37:40.667
- I am glad that I made him quit!
- You didn't make him quit! I fired him!

37:41.208 --> 37:42.500
You what?

37:42.583 --> 37:44.250
The idiot told me
he had feelings for me,

37:44.333 --> 37:46.458
which he never would have done
if you hadn't pushed him!

37:46.542 --> 37:49.166
- And now he's gone! It's all your fault!
- Ow!

37:49.250 --> 37:50.542
My back!

37:54.709 --> 37:56.041
Lynette?

37:58.625 --> 37:59.834
Honey?

38:09.500 --> 38:11.417
It'll just be a few more minutes,
Mrs Scavo.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.375
The doctor's looking at your CAT scan.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.709
Thank you.

38:15.542 --> 38:18.041
This whole thing is ridiculous.
I bumped my head.

38:18.125 --> 38:21.834
Lynette, you were dizzy
and throwing up.

38:21.917 --> 38:24.959
- Can't be too careful.
- Well, I feel just fine now.

38:30.166 --> 38:32.959
When Rick said
he had feelings for you,

38:34.125 --> 38:35.875
what did you say?

38:37.125 --> 38:41.333
I said that it was totally inappropriate,
and then I fired him.

38:45.959 --> 38:48.417
Do you have feelings for him, Lynette?

38:51.417 --> 38:54.667
Do you have feelings for Rick?

38:54.750 --> 38:56.959
I would never cheat on you.
You know that.

38:57.041 --> 38:58.875
That's not what I asked.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.208
Did you fall for him?

39:16.291 --> 39:17.542
Oh, God.

39:20.125 --> 39:23.083
Nothing happened. He's gone. It's over.

39:23.166 --> 39:24.458
Don't tell me that it's over.

39:24.542 --> 39:26.917
We've been fighting about this
all week.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.041
You miss him, don't you?

39:30.208 --> 39:32.875
- Don't do this.
- Damn.

39:37.291 --> 39:38.917
Not now. I can't.

39:42.333 --> 39:46.583
- Mrs Scavo?
- That's me.

39:46.667 --> 39:49.000
I'll be back.

39:49.083 --> 39:52.417
Actually, I'd rather
have you both come in for this.

39:58.291 --> 40:02.041
- Is it a concussion?
- No, it's just a bruise.

40:02.125 --> 40:03.542
Oh, good.

40:05.291 --> 40:08.875
But I noticed something
in your CAT scan that concerns me.

40:09.291 --> 40:10.333
Oh.

40:10.959 --> 40:14.583
You have a few swollen lymph nodes
in your neck.

40:14.667 --> 40:16.875
I want to send you in for a biopsy.

40:16.959 --> 40:18.333
A biopsy? Why?

40:18.417 --> 40:21.625
Have you noticed any change
in your appetite lately?

40:21.709 --> 40:25.792
- Any fatigue, fevers?
- Stop, just stop.

40:25.875 --> 40:28.166
What is it you think I have?

40:28.250 --> 40:32.458
I don't want you to panic.
This can be any number of things.

40:32.542 --> 40:34.625
Is one of them cancer?

40:36.083 --> 40:38.542
It could be lymphoma.

40:38.625 --> 40:41.583
We're hoping the biopsy
will rule that out.

40:44.709 --> 40:47.417
If you look at the CAT scan,

40:49.709 --> 40:54.250
you can see this white area here
stands out.

40:54.333 --> 40:57.333
These are called
submandibular lymph nodes.

40:59.166 --> 41:02.333
Lymphoma can vary according
to the type of cell that multiplies

41:02.417 --> 41:04.875
and how the cancer presents itself.

41:04.959 --> 41:09.000
There are two types, Hodgkin's
and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

41:16.709 --> 41:19.875
<i>From the moment</i>
<i>we wake up in the morning,</i>

41:19.959 --> 41:23.041
<i>till our head hits the pillow at night,</i>

41:23.125 --> 41:26.000
<i>our lives are filled with questions.</i>

41:29.458 --> 41:31.417
Is it morning yet?

41:31.500 --> 41:34.709
<i>Most are easily answered</i>
<i>and soon forgotten.</i>

41:34.792 --> 41:38.792
Not yet, sweetheart.
You go back to sleep now.

41:38.875 --> 41:42.166
<i>But some questions</i>
<i>are much harder to ask</i>

41:42.250 --> 41:45.000
<i>because we're so afraid of the answer.</i>

41:47.375 --> 41:50.500
<i>Will I be around</i>
<i>to watch my children grow up?</i>

41:53.625 --> 41:57.125
<i>Am I making a mistake</i>
<i>by marrying this man?</i>

42:01.375 --> 42:03.750
<i>Could he ever truly love me?</i>

42:07.625 --> 42:11.709
<i>And what happens when</i>
<i>we ask our self the hard question</i>

42:11.792 --> 42:14.625
<i>and get the answer</i>
<i>we'd been hoping for?</i>

42:17.333 --> 42:21.709
<i>Well, that's when happiness begins.</i>
