I MEAN, EVERYBODY ELSE IS.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.500
Mrs. Matthews:
I LOVE YOU, TOO, PUMPKIN.

09:50.233 --> 09:52.000
MORGAN SAYS SHE'S
GETTING HUNGRY,

09:52.000 --> 09:53.867
SO YOU GUYS BETTER
ORDER THAT PIZZA SOON.

09:53.867 --> 09:54.900
I'M ON IT.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.233
GOOD. HEY, KEEP YOUR EYE
ON YOUR SISTER,

09:57.233 --> 09:58.400
AND I'LL BE HOME
AROUND 10:00.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.500
FROM BOWLING, RIGHT?

09:59.500 --> 10:00.900
WHERE ELSE
WOULD I BE GOING

10:00.900 --> 10:02.400
WITH MY BOWLING BAG?

10:02.400 --> 10:05.000
OH, THIS BALL
WEIGHS A TON.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Guys: HA HA HA!

10:07.000 --> 10:08.834
OK, MAYBE IT'S NOT
AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.

10:08.834 --> 10:11.000
I SURE HOPE SO BECAUSE
THIS LOOKS PRETTY BAD.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.300
DOES IT LOOK
AS BAD AS LIVER?

10:12.300 --> 10:13.834
NO.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.800
WHY IS SHE GOING
TO LA BUGIA?

10:15.800 --> 10:18.200
WHY IS SHE GOING TO LA BUGIA
WITH A BOWLING BAG?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.834
IS THERE...
TROUBLE IN PARADISE?

10:21.834 --> 10:24.367
BETWEEN MY MOM
AND DAD? NO WAY!

10:24.367 --> 10:26.133
THEY'RE SO HAPPY,
IT'S DISGUSTING.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.500
THEY'RE ALWAYS KISSING
AND BEING ROMANTIC.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.700
ARE THEY?

10:29.700 --> 10:31.400
OR IS DAD ALWAYS KISSING
AND BEING ROMANTIC?

10:31.400 --> 10:32.934
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

10:32.934 --> 10:34.400
REMEMBER THIS MORNING HE
CAME IN WITH A ROSE FOR HER,

10:34.400 --> 10:35.500
SHE DIDN'T EVEN CARE?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.100
YEAH, AND HE POURED
COFFEE FOR HER,

10:37.100 --> 10:38.367
AND SHE JUST WALKED
AWAY.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.500
AND THAT KISS SHE GAVE HIM
THIS MORNING BEFORE SHE LEFT

10:40.500 --> 10:41.867
WAS NOTHING MORE
THAN A PITY KISS.

10:41.867 --> 10:43.767
BELIEVE ME. I KNOW
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.400
THE MAIN THING IS, SHE
PICKED WEDNESDAY NIGHTS.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.867
THE ONE NIGHT THAT DAD
HAS HIS MANAGERS' MEETING.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.100
YEAH, AND WHY WAS SHE IN SUCH
A RUSH TO LEAVE THIS MORNING?

10:53.100 --> 10:55.200
I MEAN, IS SHE TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM DAD?

10:55.200 --> 10:57.767
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE LOVES HIM ANYMORE?

10:57.767 --> 10:59.100
IT COULD MEAN WORSE.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.100
I MEAN, NO ONE GOES
TO LA BUGIA ALONE.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.500
YOU THINK SHE LOVES
SOMEBODY ELSE?

11:03.500 --> 11:04.900
YOU GUYS BETTER
TELL YOUR DAD.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.567
TELL HIM WHAT?
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.000
GET PROOF.
HOW?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.200
DON'T YOU GUYS WATCH
<i>NYPD BLUE?</i>

11:12.400 --> 11:13.500
TAIL HER...

11:13.500 --> 11:15.967
AND TALK DIRTY.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.767
TAIL HER ON OUR BIKES?

11:17.767 --> 11:19.734
GET ON A BUS. YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE'S GOING.

11:19.734 --> 11:21.400
JUST GET THERE,
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.400
YOU KNOW, HE'S RIGHT.
WE SHOULD DO THIS.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.934
I MEAN, CHANCES ARE
WE'LL GET THERE,

11:24.934 --> 11:27.967
WE'LL FIND SHE'S THERE ALONE...
IN A COCKTAIL DRESS...

11:27.967 --> 11:29.200
BOWLING.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.033
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GO UNDERCOVER.

11:31.033 --> 11:33.033
AS WHAT?
TWO KIDS.

11:33.033 --> 11:35.367
BY DAY, TWO ORDINARY KIDS.

11:35.367 --> 11:37.767
BY NIGHT, TWO ORDINARY KIDS
ON A BUS.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.700
TALKING DIRTY.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.667
WE'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.300
HERE'S THE 20.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.767
ORDER THE PIZZA,
WATCH MY HOUSE,

11:46.767 --> 11:47.967
AND GUARD MY SISTER.

11:47.967 --> 11:49.133
AND IF I'M KILLED
ON THIS MISSION,

11:49.133 --> 11:50.967
FIND OUT THE ANSWER
TO THAT CAR WASH PROBLEM

11:50.967 --> 11:53.367
FROM FEENY AND HAVE
TOPANGA CHANNEL IT TO ME.

12:04.467 --> 12:06.734
OK,
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

12:06.734 --> 12:09.834
3 DADDIES AND 2 MOMMIES.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.600
A FULL HOUSE?

12:11.600 --> 12:15.934
<i>FULL HOUSE?</i>
I LOVE THOSE OLSEN TWINS.

12:15.934 --> 12:17.767
Morgan: HI, DADDY.

12:17.767 --> 12:19.767
WELL, HEY, SWEETIE.

12:19.767 --> 12:22.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?
IT'S, UH, 10:15.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.500
SHAWN WAS TEACHING ME
HOW TO PLAY 5-CARD--

12:25.500 --> 12:27.567
GO FISH.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.900
JACKS OR BETTER TO OPEN.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.400
WHERE'S CORY AND ERIC?

12:32.400 --> 12:34.300
THEY WENT
TO THE LIBRARY.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.600
WOULD THAT BE
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY,

12:36.600 --> 12:38.500
THE ONE
THAT CLOSES AT 9:00?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.667
NO, NO. THE OTHER ONE.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.900
I'M GOING
TO PUT MORGAN TO BED,

12:42.900 --> 12:45.133
AND THEN YOU AND I ARE
GONNA TALK A LITTLE MORE.

12:45.133 --> 12:47.200
KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP
BUILDING THING?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.700
NO.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.500
GREAT. FIRST TIME IN
MY LIFE I'M IN TROUBLE

12:52.500 --> 12:53.567
WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S DAD.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.500
GUYS! YOUR DAD
JUST GOT HOME.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.967
WHERE IS HE?

12:57.967 --> 12:59.200
UPSTAIRS PUTTING YOUR SISTER
TO BED. WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

12:59.200 --> 13:00.934
NOTHING GOOD.

13:00.934 --> 13:02.233
MOM WAS AT THE CLUB.

13:02.233 --> 13:03.934
SHE WAS DANCING
WITH SOME GUY.

13:03.934 --> 13:05.367
IN THOSE RED SHOES.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.734
WOW!

13:06.734 --> 13:07.934
SHE WAS SNUGGLING UP
WITH HIM IN A DARK BOOTH.

13:07.934 --> 13:09.033
WHO WAS IT?

13:09.033 --> 13:10.100
I DON'T KNOW.
I COULDN'T TELL.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.400
NEITHER COULD I.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.233
THERE WERE LACE CURTAINS
AND PLASTIC GRAPES

13:13.233 --> 13:15.200
HANGING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.033
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

13:17.033 --> 13:18.133
I HAVE NO IDEA.

13:18.133 --> 13:20.133
I CAN'T KEEP THIS
A SECRET, ERIC.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.800
YOU KNOW ME. I'LL CRACK.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.967
DAD WILL SAY,
"GOOD NIGHT, SON,"

13:22.967 --> 13:25.233
AND I'LL SAY, "MOM
WAS WITH ANOTHER GUY!"

13:25.233 --> 13:26.600
SHH!

13:26.600 --> 13:28.400
LOOK, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE'LL HAVE TO TELL HIM.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.467
CORY. ERIC.

13:30.467 --> 13:32.300
YOU KNOW I'M
ALWAYS HERE FOR YOU.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.500
JUST NOT RIGHT NOW.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.600
OH, BY THE WAY,

13:35.600 --> 13:37.300
I TOLD HIM YOU WERE
AT THE LIBRARY.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.000
GREAT LIE, SHAWN.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.200
THE LIBRARY
CLOSES AT 9:00.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.567
YEAH. HE KNEW THAT, TOO.

13:42.567 --> 13:45.500
THIS IS NOT GONNA
BE EASY TO TELL DAD.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.734
MAYBE WE COULD JUST
SEND HIM A LETTER.

13:47.734 --> 13:50.200
"DEAR SIR, YOUR WIFE WAS
DANCING WITH ANOTHER GUY.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.500
SIGNED...
A CONCERNED CITIZEN."

13:51.500 --> 13:53.000
Mr. Matthews:
GOOD NIGHT, MORGAN.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.033
OH, NO. HE'S GONNA SAY
GOOD NIGHT TO ME NEXT.

13:55.033 --> 13:57.667
I'M GONNA BLOW! YOU GOTTA
HANDLE THIS, ERIC.

13:57.667 --> 13:58.967
LOOK, YOU
JUST STAY QUIET.

13:58.967 --> 14:00.300
LET ME DO
ALL THE TALKING.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.934
WHY, HEY, GUYS.

14:01.934 --> 14:03.100
HI, DAD.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.200
WHERE'S SHAWN?

14:04.200 --> 14:05.400
OH, SHAWN DECIDED
TO WALK HOME.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.600
I'D HAVE DRIVEN HIM.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.300
RELAX, DAD. HE LIVES
2 BLOCKS AWAY.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.500
NOW WHY DON'T YOU
SIT DOWN, RELAX,

14:09.500 --> 14:10.700
AND NOT THINK
THAT ANYTHING TERRIBLE

14:10.700 --> 14:11.700
IS GOING ON
IN YOUR LIFE.

14:11.700 --> 14:12.900
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME PIZZA?

14:12.900 --> 14:14.100
MMM.
HEY, WHERE'S MY CHANGE?

14:14.100 --> 14:15.834
YOU KNOW,
SPEAKING OF CHANGE,

14:15.834 --> 14:18.200
CHANGE CAN BE A VERY
POSITIVE THING IN ONE'S LIFE,

14:18.200 --> 14:20.400
ESPECIALLY UNEXPECTED CHANGE,
WHICH FUNNILY ENOUGH,

14:20.400 --> 14:22.400
WE'LL BE TALKING
ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

14:24.734 --> 14:27.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE WERE YOU TWO?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.400
UH, WELL,
FOR 2 1/2 HOURS,

14:29.400 --> 14:31.300
WE WERE ON 4
DIFFERENT CITY BUSES

14:31.300 --> 14:34.467
GOING TO AND COMING
FROM THIS PLACE.

14:34.467 --> 14:36.300
THIS PLACE?

14:36.300 --> 14:38.100
COULD YOU BE A LITTLE
MORE SPECIFIC, PLEASE?

14:38.100 --> 14:40.800
UH, IT WAS
A RECTANGULAR PLACE.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.500
WE, UH, WE WERE
AT LA BUGIA, DAD.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.100
MMM!

14:47.100 --> 14:48.834
LA BUGIA?

14:48.834 --> 14:50.600
MOM WAS WITH ANOTHER GUY!

14:51.700 --> 14:52.867
SHE WAS DANCING.

14:52.867 --> 14:54.800
WITH ANOTHER GUY!

14:54.800 --> 14:56.500
CORY LOOKED
IN THE WINDOW

14:56.500 --> 14:58.133
AND RECOGNIZED
MOM'S SHOES

14:58.133 --> 14:59.200
AND THE SHOES OF--

14:59.200 --> 15:01.600
DO I HAVE TO DRAW
YOU A PICTURE?

15:01.600 --> 15:04.200
IT'S ALL WE COULD SEE.
IT WAS DARK.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.400
THERE'S MOM'S CAR.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.300
QUICK. MORE PIZZA.

15:12.100 --> 15:16.300
WELL, I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO HAVE
A LITTLE TALK WITH YOUR MOTHER.

15:18.133 --> 15:21.667
HEY, I'M HERE
FOR YOU, DAD.

15:21.667 --> 15:23.600
THAT'S WHY I HAD YOU, SON.

15:31.767 --> 15:33.400
HEY, STRANGER.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.934
HI.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.800
WELL, I JUST HAD AN
INTERESTING CONVERSATION

15:37.800 --> 15:39.200
WITH CORY AND ERIC.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.400
IS ANYTHING WRONG?

15:40.400 --> 15:41.734
YEAH. WE'RE BUSTED.

15:41.734 --> 15:45.233
OH, MAN,
THEY FOUND OUT?

15:45.233 --> 15:47.200
GUESS WE JUST WEREN'T
SNEAKY ENOUGH.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.133
ACTUALLY,
I WAS SNEAKY ENOUGH.

15:49.133 --> 15:50.300
WHAT?

15:50.300 --> 15:53.767
THEY ONLY CAUGHT YOU,
YOU, YOU BRAZEN HUSSY.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.767
THEY'RE STILL TALKING.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

15:58.767 --> 16:00.367
THEY'RE NOT YELLING?
NOT YET.

16:00.367 --> 16:02.133
OH, NO. LOOK, AS LONG
AS THEY'RE NOT YELLING,

16:02.133 --> 16:03.900
WE HAVE A CHANCE,
BUT ONCE THEY GO QUIET,

16:03.900 --> 16:05.667
THAT'S WHEN WE'RE
IN REAL TROUBLE.

16:05.667 --> 16:06.867
Cory: WHAT'S IT MEAN
WHEN HE'S SMILING?

16:06.867 --> 16:08.400
HE'S SMILING?
UH-HUH.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.567
OH, NO. HE'S LOST IT.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.033
HE'S TURNED
INTO FREDDY KRUEGER.

16:11.033 --> 16:13.033
I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW FREDDY
ALWAYS SMILES BEFORE--

16:13.033 --> 16:15.200
TCH--AAH!

16:16.400 --> 16:17.667
SHE'S GONE!
WHAT?

16:17.667 --> 16:20.100
MOM'S GONE! SHE LEFT!
I DON'T SEE HER!

16:20.100 --> 16:21.767
WE'LL NEVER
SEE HER AGAIN, ERIC!

16:21.767 --> 16:24.000
WE DON'T HAVE
A MOTHER ANYMORE!

16:24.000 --> 16:25.900
HI, GUYS.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.133
I OVERREACTED.

16:27.133 --> 16:29.300
MOM, ARE WE STILL
A FAMILY,

16:29.300 --> 16:31.567
OR HAVE WE BECOME LIKE
AN AFTER-SCHOOL SPECIAL?

16:31.567 --> 16:33.000
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.200
ARE YOU SURE? BECAUSE
DAD WAS SMILING.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.500
I UNDERSTAND YOU 2

16:36.500 --> 16:38.500
DID A LITTLE
DETECTIVE WORK TONIGHT.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.367
SORRY WE RATTED
ON YOU, MOM.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.600
IT WAS ME.
I FOLDED UNDER TORTURE.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.233
YEAH. DAD SAID HELLO.

16:45.967 --> 16:48.400
LOOK, I DIDN'T GO
BOWLING TONIGHT.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.500
AAHH...

16:50.500 --> 16:52.900
AND I DID STOP
AT A GAS STATION

16:52.900 --> 16:54.834
AND CHANGE INTO THAT
DRESS THAT YOU SAW.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.934
AAHH...

16:56.934 --> 16:58.600
AND I DID GO
TO LA BUGIA

16:58.600 --> 17:00.967
AND DANCED THE NIGHT AWAY
WITH THE MOST EXCITING,

17:00.967 --> 17:03.567
WONDERFUL GUY I KNOW.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.934
MOM, SHOULDN'T THIS CONFESSION
BE A LITTLE HARDER FOR YOU?

17:06.934 --> 17:10.100
I WAS DANCING
WITH YOUR FATHER.

17:10.100 --> 17:11.100
WHAT?

17:11.100 --> 17:12.367
DAD'S NOT OUR FATHER?

17:13.934 --> 17:15.300
IT WAS DAD!

17:15.300 --> 17:17.734
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU GUYS KNOWN ME?

17:17.734 --> 17:19.200
SINCE WE WERE BORN?

17:19.200 --> 17:20.400
BEFORE WE WERE BORN.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.100
RIGHT! YOU KNOW ME
INSIDE AND OUT.

17:23.100 --> 17:24.734
YOU KNOW MY HEART.

17:24.734 --> 17:27.233
I WAS DANCING
WITH YOUR FATHER.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.400
BUT I THOUGHT DAD HAD
A MANAGERS' MEETING.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.700
BOGUS.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.800
LIKE YOUR BOWLING LEAGUE.
YEAH.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.300
SO YOU GUYS LIED TO US.

17:34.300 --> 17:37.033
LOOK, COR, I HAVE
A WONDERFUL LIFE,

17:37.033 --> 17:38.500
AND I LOVE
BEING A MOTHER,

17:38.500 --> 17:40.667
BUT THAT'S JUST
NOT ALL OF WHO I AM.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.200
I MEAN, I ALSO
HAVE A CAREER,

17:42.200 --> 17:44.734
AND I HAPPEN TO BE MADLY
IN LOVE WITH MY HUSBAND.

17:44.734 --> 17:46.400
COOL.
YECCH.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.100
I'M SORRY YOU
FEEL THAT WAY, COR,

17:49.100 --> 17:50.500
BECAUSE
YOUR FATHER AND I

17:50.500 --> 17:52.567
WORK VERY HARD TO KEEP
OUR RELATIONSHIP FRESH.

17:55.133 --> 17:57.400
YOU KNOW, KEEP
THE ELECTRICITY GOING.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.600
WE WANT TO STAY HOT
FOR EACH OTHER.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.500
AAGH...

18:03.500 --> 18:05.100
CORY.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.300
YOU GUYS SNUCK OFF
AND LIED TO US.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.500
LOOK, COR,
DID YOU EVER CUT SCHOOL?

18:10.500 --> 18:11.667
ME? NO. UH-UH.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.200
OFF THE RECORD.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.000
ONCE IN FIFTH GRADE.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.033
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

18:16.033 --> 18:18.567
YEAH.
I WENT TO THE MALL.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.033
IT WAS REALLY COOL.

18:20.033 --> 18:22.133
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE BEEN TO
THE MALL A HUNDRED TIMES.

18:22.133 --> 18:23.400
NOW, MAYBE IT WAS FUN

18:23.400 --> 18:25.300
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.734
YOU KNOW, LIKE IT
WAS A BIT DANGEROUS?

18:27.734 --> 18:28.800
GET IT?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.567
YEAH!

18:30.567 --> 18:32.500
NO.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.834
COME ON, CORY.

18:33.834 --> 18:35.734
I MEAN, IT'S EXCITING.
IT'S ADULT.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.200
SNEAKING AROUND'S
ROMANTIC.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.967
VERY COOL, MOM.
I APPROVE.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.100
THANK YOU, ERIC.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.734
WELL, I DON'T APPROVE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS

18:42.734 --> 18:44.200
WERE JUST TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM US.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.300
AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.567
SEE, THAT'S THE FINE LINE

18:46.567 --> 18:48.467
BETWEEN BEING AN ADULT
AND BEING A KID.

18:48.467 --> 18:49.967
WHEN YOU'RE A KID,
YOU SEE EVERYTHING

18:49.967 --> 18:52.033
AS RIGHT OR WRONG,
BLACK OR WHITE--

18:52.033 --> 18:54.200
BLONDE OR BRUNETTE.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.367
BUT WHEN
YOU'RE AN ADULT,

18:56.367 --> 18:59.233
YOU REALIZE THAT,
THAT NOT EVERYTHING

18:59.233 --> 19:01.100
IS AS SIMPLE
AS RIGHT OR WRONG.

19:01.100 --> 19:04.233
I MEAN, SOMETIMES
THERE ARE GRAY AREAS.

19:04.233 --> 19:06.233
ANY OF THIS
MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

19:06.233 --> 19:07.867
OF COURSE.
I'M AN ADULT.

19:07.867 --> 19:09.867
YOU'RE VERY COOL, MOM.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.300
I'LL TAKE COOL.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.900
NOW, IF YOU GUYS
WILL EXCUSE ME,

19:12.900 --> 19:14.700
THERE'S A GUY
IN THE BACK YARD

19:14.700 --> 19:16.900
WHO OWES ME
A GOODNIGHT KISS.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.200
IT'S OK. IT'S DAD.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.467
GOOD MORNING.

19:55.467 --> 19:58.100
[BELL RINGS]

20:01.900 --> 20:04.834
AL WASHES A CAR
IN 6 MINUTES.

20:04.834 --> 20:08.200
FRED WASHES THE SAME CAR
IN 8 MINUTES.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.233
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE THEM
TO WASH THE CAR TOGETHER?

20:11.233 --> 20:14.367
AND THE ANSWER IS STILL
NOT 7, MR. MATTHEWS.

20:14.367 --> 20:15.834
I KNOW THAT, SIR.

20:15.834 --> 20:18.000
WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.734
I KNOW WHY YOU GAVE US
THIS WORD PROBLEM.

20:19.734 --> 20:23.500
TO SUCK THE FUN
OUT OF OUR LIVES.

20:23.500 --> 20:26.133
YEAH, THAT, BUT
THE MAIN REASON IS

20:26.133 --> 20:28.767
TO GET US TO STOP
THINKING LIKE KIDS

20:28.767 --> 20:30.900
AND START THINKING
LIKE ADULTS.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.967
I KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT
ALWAYS ONE RIGHT ANSWER.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.200
THERE MAY NOT EVEN
BE AN ANSWER AT ALL.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.500
STARTLING.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.667
AND HOW DID YOU ARRIVE
AT THAT CONCLUSION?

20:40.667 --> 20:41.934
I FOUND OUT THAT SOMETIMES

20:41.934 --> 20:44.834
WE NEED TO LEARN TO THINK
DIFFERENTLY.

20:44.834 --> 20:45.867
THAT'S HOW TOPANGA KNEW.

20:45.867 --> 20:47.800
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
DIFFERENTLY.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.967
REALLY DIFFERENTLY.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.667
WELL, MR. MATTHEWS,

20:52.667 --> 20:54.400
IN ALL THE TIME WE'VE
KNOWN EACH OTHER,

20:54.400 --> 20:56.900
I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVERBEEN SO IMPRESSED.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.400
THANKS, MR. FEENY.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.567
IN THE COURSE
OF YOUR EDUCATION,

21:00.567 --> 21:04.300
YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO LOOK
FOR THE RIGHT ANSWER.

21:04.300 --> 21:07.033
BUT YOU ALSO MUST KNOW
THAT IN LIFE,

21:07.033 --> 21:12.967
MANY TIMES THE RIGHT ANSWER
IS THAT THERE ISN'T ONE.

21:12.967 --> 21:16.500
THIS IS AN ESPECIALLY
VALUABLE LESSON FOR YOU,

21:16.500 --> 21:17.700
MR. MINKUS.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.900
SO I'M AFRAID
YOUR CALCULATIONS

21:19.900 --> 21:22.000
ARE ALL FOR NAUGHT.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.800
NOT NECESSARILY.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.000
I THINK I MAY HAVE
INADVERTENTLY DISCOVERED

21:26.000 --> 21:27.867
THE SECRET
OF TIME TRAVEL.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.700
DID YOUR SPIRIT GUIDE
TALK TO YOU

21:32.700 --> 21:34.100
AND GIVE YOU THE ANSWER?

21:34.100 --> 21:36.200
YEAH. MY MOM.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.233
WAIT A MINUTE.

21:51.233 --> 21:52.900
MAYBE TIME ISN'T
A CONTINUUM.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.767
MAYBE IT'S A RANDOM
REPETITION OF MOMENTS.

21:55.767 --> 21:57.200
I THINK I'VE GOT IT!

22:09.133 --> 22:10.400
A CONTINUUM.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.200
MAYBE IT'S A RANDOM
REPETITION OF MOMENTS.

22:24.967 --> 22:26.200
A CONTINUUM.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.100
MAYBE IT'S A RANDOM
REPETITION OF MOMENTS.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.600
NAH.
