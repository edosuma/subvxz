You must get us three fated villagers

00:05.080 --> 00:07.800
Where is the third? Where is our sister?

00:07.960 --> 00:10.600
-Bella owns the cloak.
-She'll be fun to hunt.

Tara, what is with you? Tara?

00:13.800 --> 00:16.200
The ancient magic!
If you became Bella

00:16.400 --> 00:19.280
and got Cameron to fall for her,
he can bring her back.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.360
I don't think I can do this.

I can't bring myself to do it, Otto.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.000
I'm to give Cameron away
after how far we come?

01:07.120 --> 01:10.920
He's not yours to give.
Just like she's not mine.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.520
What?
Nothing.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.480
You like her.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.920
You give her a kiss and bring her back!
I, uh...

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I already tried.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.600
It's a two way street Tara.
If she doesn't like you back...

01:26.800 --> 01:29.280
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it.

01:32.520 --> 01:36.120
It has to be Cameron.
It's the only thing to do.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.400
You know, as Bella,
you can kiss Cameron.

01:40.440 --> 01:44.400
How can something be so right
and so wrong, all at the same time?

Now. Tell us what you think
the tapestry means.

02:18.640 --> 02:22.600
You misread the tapestry's answer.

It's not a member of the Circle
you seek,

02:25.800 --> 02:28.520
it's the owner of a purple cloak.

02:28.680 --> 02:32.200
We've been through them all!

02:32.400 --> 02:35.680
There is one left.

02:38.920 --> 02:42.000
Sorsha Doyle owns a purple cloak.

Sorsha, Mrs. Daily says you sent her home

Father, I'm terrible at this.
No, you're just finding your feet.

03:02.800 --> 03:08.320
How many feet do I have to find?
Yesterday I sold the cash register!

03:08.480 --> 03:10.680
Now that was just a labelling error.

03:10.880 --> 03:16.480
And now I've forgotten
to order the stumpy plums!

03:16.600 --> 03:20.200
But-- But we need stumpy plums!
I'll pay anything!

-Anything, you say?
-Where are you going to get stumpy plums?

03:25.120 --> 03:30.840
Don't think I'm not impressed that your
question wasn't "what are stumpy plums."

03:31.000 --> 03:33.480
I can get my hands on some
wild stumpy plums.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.960
Wild stumpy plums?
Do you possess the picking skills?

03:37.080 --> 03:39.800
Okay, so now I'm asking what.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.920
There are two types of stumpy plums,

03:42.040 --> 03:46.960
fruit of the demigods stumpy plums,
and poisonous stumpy plums.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.040
Unfortunately the two are identical,

03:49.200 --> 03:53.080
and only those trained
in the art of picking can tell them apart.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.920

Bella is graceful, slow and deliberate.
She's direct, but with just a--

04:50.560 --> 04:54.000
Just a hint of vulnerability
that makes you want to know

04:54.120 --> 04:56.880

You are.

You're going to have to make him hate you.

I can't relax when she has a plan.

-Why the change of heart?
-What does it matter?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.480
No, I would like to hear this.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.920
Do you think you
and I are so different, child?

05:47.280 --> 05:52.680
I had a boy who made my heart beat faster.
I rejected my Choosing for him.

05:52.880 --> 05:57.520
That boy broke my heart.
But the Circle took pity.

05:57.680 --> 06:02.440
They opened their arms, and allowed me
to take up the purple cloak after all.

06:02.560 --> 06:07.600
It is only just that I extend you
the same forgiveness.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.640

06:11.000 --> 06:14.280

06:14.440 --> 06:18.520
you would be welcomed back
into the Circle,

06:18.680 --> 06:21.640
once again to take up your purple cloak.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.040

14:55.360 --> 14:58.240
Let's just get this over and done with.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.120
Seal it with a kiss.

15:02.280 --> 15:06.000
If he kisses you back. We're home free.

15:10.160 --> 15:15.600
-I have no idea what I'm doing!
-Calm. You ca do thith.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.720
Hey! I think I felt something!
I think this one is kind!

15:19.880 --> 15:23.600
-Are you thor?
-What happens if you eat two bad plums?

15:23.760 --> 15:26.680
-You explode.
-You explode?

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
I knew you could do it Jakey boy!
You are a proper stumpy plum picker!

16:09.680 --> 16:11.000
Where are the Circle?

16:11.120 --> 16:13.560
The Circle are fearful of the dark forces

16:13.720 --> 16:17.600
that have been tampering
with the tapestry from the shadows.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.360
Are you?
No.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.280
That is why you belong here.

16:28.840 --> 16:33.120
(CHUCKLES)
You've seen through me. Truth time.

16:33.280 --> 16:37.800
This is why I need you back in the Circle.
To protect the lantern.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.640
I came up with a bunch of ideas
of where we can take your story.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.800
-Oh sorry, am I writing it for you?
-No.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.520
Where was this girl before?

16:52.680 --> 16:55.880
You mean the girl that likes your writing?
So shallow.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.360
The girl that doesn't care
what people think.

16:59.600 --> 17:05.200
You seem so open. Relaxed. Fun.

17:05.360 --> 17:09.760
(SNIFFS)
It's not easy for everyone to be like it.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.880
Tara. Where's Bella?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.640
Cameron. A terrible magic took Bella away.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.280
What?
We can bring her back.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.880
All it needs is a kiss.

17:49.400 --> 17:53.880
Please just do it. Now.
And we can all go back to normal.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.200
Okay.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.640
What. The. What.

18:15.800 --> 18:20.120
-Bella, you're okay!
-Cameron.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.000
I have wanted nothing more than this.

18:31.080 --> 18:34.440
But not at the expense of Seb.
No!

18:34.640 --> 18:38.320
What?
I can't believe I'm about to say this...

18:38.520 --> 18:41.200
Your dad was right. You belong here.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.440
This is your duty, Sorsha.
You taught me about that.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.720
And it's my duty to let you be
who you want to be.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.280
Go get your purple cloak.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.880
Let it happen, Fated one.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.240
Let it happen...

19:35.200 --> 19:39.600
(FAINT INDISTICT WHISPERING)

19:43.560 --> 19:46.440
Welcome home, sister.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.920
Next time on Everymoor Chronicles.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.760
You're back in the Circle?

19:54.920 --> 19:57.000
What's that?
I'm fine.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.600
The founder is in Sorsha.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.000
-What?
-I saw in her reflection.

20:01.160 --> 20:05.040
There is no one person in Evermoor
even remotely like me.

20:05.200 --> 20:08.240
Seb's dream girl
is a female version of himself?

20:08.400 --> 20:12.800
-Why am I not surprised?
-She's not as cute as she seems.
