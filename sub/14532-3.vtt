00:04.630 --> 00:06.724
Previously on "Power"...

00:08.467 --> 00:10.265
- Felipe Lobos is alive.
- What?

00:10.427 --> 00:13.021
- He survived the attack in prison.
- You talked to Lobos?

00:13.180 --> 00:15.023
He thinks the Jimenez
ordered the attack.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.105
You're safe.
I guess Ghost really is dead.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.986
I have made promises
because of our deal.

00:20.145 --> 00:23.319
If I had more drugs, I would gladly
take more of your money, but I don't.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.405
- Stay for dinner.
- Enjoy some of our services.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.990
Slow your roll, tiger.
There'll be time for that.

00:28.153 --> 00:32.078
Kill Fantasma
and become my sole distributor

00:32.241 --> 00:34.414
or I will kill the both of you.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.624
Lobos ordered me to kill Ghost,

00:36.787 --> 00:39.290
and since I didn't do it,
he's coming after us.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.254
I know you can kill Ghost.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.004
I hear you have a problem.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.764
Apparently, I can help.

Do you not see this gun in your face?

02:29.608 --> 02:31.702
Move, nigga, empty out
the fucking register.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.580
All the money, all the money,
all the money.

02:33.605 --> 02:35.197
What the fuck?
Open the register, son.

02:35.364 --> 02:38.117
The fuck you doing?
Open up the fuckin' register.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.377
Okay, stop fucking talking
and move, bro.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.129
Stop fucking doing the...
Open the fucking register.

02:43.245 --> 02:44.765
Hurry the fuck up, bro.
I swear to God.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.270
Do you not see this shit
in your face?

02:46.375 --> 02:48.310
What are you doing?
Put that shit in the fucking bag.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.087
Wookie. Wookie,
what the fuck are you doing?

02:50.253 --> 02:52.898
- We ain't supposed to do shit like this.
- Motherfucker, I need money.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.763
Shut the fuck up
and go watch the goddamn door.

02:54.929 --> 02:56.409
Give me the Oxy.
Give me the Adderall.

02:56.514 --> 02:57.723
- Wook, come on.
- Move.

03:06.090 --> 03:08.330
Oxy, all that shit. Hurry up.
Everything you have, nigga.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.395
- Shut the fuck up!
- Move!

03:09.523 --> 03:11.083
Let's get the hell out of here!
Come on!

03:17.364 --> 03:19.964
Fuck are you doing, man?!
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

03:19.989 --> 03:22.287
Freeze! Don't fucking move!

03:22.452 --> 03:24.170
Lower your weapon slowly.

03:24.329 --> 03:27.048
- Drop the weapon now.
- What the fuck you do?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.647
You supposed to be
watching the door.

03:28.672 --> 03:31.512
Sir, is there anyone else
in the store with you?

03:31.670 --> 03:34.264
No, I'm working alone,
so I triggered the silent alarm.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.391
- You already triggered the alarm?
- Yeah.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.269
I wish you hadn't done that.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.271
Shoot this motherfucker.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.811
How many times have I told y'all
not to do a job without a plan?

03:46.977 --> 03:50.072
If I wanted to be somebody's mama,
I'd have had kids of my own.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.948
Let me explain, yo.
I was just...

03:55.318 --> 03:57.446
I got this.
Get the fuck out of here.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.410
Dumb motherfucker.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.416
You made me do this shit to you.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.295
Car 41805.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.132
We got a 10-13.

04:09.291 --> 04:13.387
Shots fired at
1462 Alabama Ave southeast.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.510
Officer-involved shooting.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.425
Two victims down.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.095
Officer LaVerne Ganner
shot and killed the suspect

04:21.261 --> 04:24.856
after he gunned down the night
clerk at this family-owned pharmacy.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.359
Both men were pronounced dead
at the scene.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.270
Officer Ganner is an eight-year
veteran of the department.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.316
She is a member of
the National Black Police Association.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.531
The media relation liaison
made Officer Ganner available

04:36.693 --> 04:38.491
earlier for a brief statement.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.701
I am sorry that I arrived too late...

04:40.864 --> 04:43.333
Good day at the office, Jukebox?

04:43.492 --> 04:46.166
These motherfuckers.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.377
I think of the plight of
our young black men here in D.C.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.633
and all over the nation.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.888
Too many of our boys
end up in prison or dead.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.344
There was no surveillance tape
on scene,

04:58.507 --> 05:00.467
- so police would like to...
- Thanks for the tea.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.397
What are we gonna do now?

05:06.598 --> 05:08.600
Same as planned.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.441
We're just a man down.
Wookie couldn't be trusted, anyway.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.322
Always putting himself first.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.571
You got the mustard?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.532
Yeah, it's right there.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.448
What about ole boy?

05:23.073 --> 05:25.201
I'm not so sure about him, either.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.753
Have you heard anything?

05:28.912 --> 05:31.540
He been in and out since you
brought him here from the hospital.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.889
Not a peep from
his fine ass all day.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.265
♪ Work on 'em,
put a little work on 'em ♪

06:29.431 --> 06:31.671
♪ Trigger finger in the air,
I put a little dirt on 'em ♪

06:46.990 --> 06:50.460
- Come here.
- I'm not falling for it.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.917
- Falling for what?
- You just don't want me to beat you.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.922
What, are we in high school here?

06:55.081 --> 06:57.880
My track coach would love this.
You still trying to beat me.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.922
The girls couldn't run.
How else was I supposed to get faster?

07:01.087 --> 07:02.887
- Good point.
- I got tired of coming in first

07:02.912 --> 07:04.539
in the slow lane.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.516
Jamie, you think it went
all right with the kids?

07:08.678 --> 07:10.680
Got to come in first there,
too, Ang?

07:12.015 --> 07:14.859
I don't know.
I think it went great.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.691
You know? We'll work it out.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.197
We'll make it work,
and we'll be a family.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.992
That's what I want.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.454
Well, we'll have
everything we want,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.293
'cause where there's a will,
there's a way,

07:28.451 --> 07:30.851
and you and me are the most
willful motherfuckers I ever met.

07:30.876 --> 07:33.954
Speaking of getting everything you want.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.793
Things all right at the club?

07:35.956 --> 07:39.335
You left me alone with the kids
the first time they came over.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.003
Must have been important.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.796
Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.716
No, I liked it, but everything
worked out okay, though, right?

07:45.882 --> 07:47.555
Come on. Are you kidding me?

07:47.717 --> 07:51.642
It's me.
I got everything on lock.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.520
Matter of fact,
I'm feeling so good,

07:54.683 --> 07:56.883
maybe I'll give you a head start
back to your apartment.

07:56.908 --> 07:58.653
I'm gonna win anyway, of course.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.780
- Challenge accepted.
- All right.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.907
Okay, Miss Thing.
You got 60 seconds.

08:03.692 --> 08:04.784
Go!

08:19.666 --> 08:21.466
Why the fuck you drag us
all the way out here?

08:21.584 --> 08:23.586
We need new paperwork
to cover the new business.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.847
And what business is that?

08:26.923 --> 08:29.426
- Hair weaves?
- Oh, shit.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.186
Yes, hair weaves.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.775
I got a hair connect who'll give us
a great price if we pay in cash.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.355
- Nice.
- Okay, but how do we actually

08:38.518 --> 08:41.361
clean the money,
like make it legit?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.445
Babe, dope money is dirty.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.111
The good thing is
that it's cash,

08:48.278 --> 08:50.952
- which makes it untraceable.
- Exactly.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.458
We're gonna use this dirty cash

08:53.616 --> 08:55.960
to buy hair in bulk
at a wholesale price,

08:56.119 --> 08:58.872
then sell it to other salons
at double what we paid for it,

08:59.039 --> 09:01.462
but money coming
from other salons is clean.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.672
How do you know the other salons
will buy from you?

09:03.835 --> 09:06.008
They won't have a choice,
sweetie.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.799
Our prices'll be lower
than anything on the streets.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.925
We dummy the receipts,
make it look like the money

09:10.950 --> 09:12.543
was coming from
my initial investment.

09:12.702 --> 09:14.850
Looks like Tommy and I
sold out the wash-and-folds

09:15.013 --> 09:17.607
- and went into hair for a living.
- Which is what we did.

09:17.766 --> 09:18.767
Right.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.660
I mean, from there, it's just about
generating enough receipts

09:20.685 --> 09:22.528
to keep up with
the amount of cash coming in.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.247
Which is what
you'll teach me how to do.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.525
Yeah, and to deal with the bank.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.740
I mean, we're fine now, since you
just got product in the pipeline,

09:29.903 --> 09:33.498
but soon, we're gonna
need to open up more salons

09:33.656 --> 09:35.078
to keep up with the cash.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.585
That's where LaKeisha comes in.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.998
Instead of just doing hair,
we're gonna start selling it, too.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.041
We sell wholesale
to the competition,

09:43.208 --> 09:45.836
and then we sell retail
to your customers,

09:46.002 --> 09:48.004
double and tripling the profits.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.845
Then we'll make enough money
to expand.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.930
Open up a new location.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.687
- A new location?
- Yeah, and then a new one,

09:55.845 --> 09:57.563
another one, a franchise.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.895
You gonna be the McDonald's
of weaves.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.527
I hope you're right, T.,
'cause if so,

10:02.685 --> 10:05.609
we both gonna be rich as shit.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.070
And then maybe I can
buy you something for once.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.736
It's nice having you here, girl.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.363
Thanks for doing this with me.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.574

12:11.814 --> 12:13.782
Yo, holla at me ASAP, dog.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.830
Brought your gimp ass a cane.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.835
Damn, cuz,
I look crippled to you?

12:24.994 --> 12:27.588
Pitiful's more like it.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.670
Like you ain't been eating
or some shit.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.800
I'm on that Black Panther diet.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.337
I don't fuck with no white shit.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.722
No potatoes, no rice,

12:35.880 --> 12:38.759
no pasta, not even bread.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.769
Yeah, well,
beggars can't be choosers,

12:41.928 --> 12:44.727
especially when
you're in your condition.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.860
I'll be a'ight
when I get back on my feet.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.775
Pass me them pills.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.608
Not until you tell me
why you're here.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.975
Come on, we already
went over this shit at the hospital.

12:58.069 --> 13:01.664
I ain't talking about the lie we told
the doctors to get you treated.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.040
I want to know the truth.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.702
Why'd I have to drive up
to New York to get your ass

13:05.868 --> 13:07.120
and bring you back to D.C.?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.210
I got in a fight with some niggas.

13:09.372 --> 13:12.717
I wound up bleeding out
on the side of the road.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.877
What niggas?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.967
Territory beef.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.007
Guess they won.

13:34.897 --> 13:38.117
I ain't giving you shit
till you be real with me

13:38.276 --> 13:40.745
and tell me what's really going on.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.905
Now, quit bullshitting, Jukebox.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.074
Shit ain't fucking funny.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.790
Half my side busted in here, man.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.330
Yeah? Deal with it.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.962
Give me my shit.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.298
My pills.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.760
Thank you for meeting with me
on such short notice.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.020
Karen, don't be silly.
It's our pleasure.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.853
I still have to talk to my team
about the financials,

14:09.015 --> 14:10.858
but you guys seem great.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.439
Well, so do you.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.775
Sorry, mate.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.029
Could we get the check?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.691
Sir, your bill's already been paid.

14:17.857 --> 14:18.904
By Who?

14:20.443 --> 14:23.196
Gentlemen, I wanted
to personally thank you

14:23.363 --> 14:26.788
for your unsavory business practices,
so I called your assistant,

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
and she told me
where you were having dinner.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.120
We got to fire her.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.767
No, I can't fire her.
I'm fucking her.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.841
- Thank you for dinner, Mister...
- St. Patrick.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.172
I'm James St. Patrick,
and you are...

14:37.335 --> 14:39.178
Karen Bassett.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.305
You're welcome for dinner,
and lovely to meet you.

14:41.464 --> 14:42.966
Did you call my assistant as well?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.226
No, I didn't.
I actually recognize you.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.971
Your family's hotel group

14:49.138 --> 14:51.937
just opened a property in St. Barts,
but now you're branching out

14:52.100 --> 14:53.818
- on your own, right?
- Right.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.370
We're in the middle of
something right now, mate.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.318
Why don't you pop by
our place tomorrow

14:57.480 --> 14:59.073
and we'll finish
our discussion, yeah?

15:00.108 --> 15:02.736
Ms. Bassett, I don't know
what your interest in these two is,

15:02.902 --> 15:07.157
but a friendly piece of advice...
Watch the company you keep.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.371
Okay, let's...

15:09.534 --> 15:11.457
Dinner's over. Let's go.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.289
It is over.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.794
Have a great rest of your night.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.055
Pleasure to meet you. Thank you.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.882
Gentlemen.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.268
So it's not a true four-bedroom.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.976
It's more of a three-bedroom
with a maid's room.

15:30.138 --> 15:33.859
The last one is still a toddler,
so the maid's might be fine for now.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.519
- What did you say your husband...
- Boyfriend.

15:36.686 --> 15:40.111
- Boyfriend does for a living?
- He's a nightclub owner.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.526
Good, sounds like
he can afford the place.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.911
No, no, I'll be paying for half.

15:45.069 --> 15:48.369
Well, maybe a little less than half.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.951
All right, well,
here's the application.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.541
Fill it out, and we can
get the process started.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.049
Welcome to your new life.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.430
- What's that smell?
- It's burning hair.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.891
You'll get used to it. Come on.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.896
- Hey, what's up, girl?
- What's up, Tash?

16:13.055 --> 16:16.980
Trying to get shit set up,
so this is Tommy's girlfriend Holly.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.566
She's gonna be helping me
with the books.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.609
- Nice to meet you.
- I wanted you guys to meet.

16:21.634 --> 16:24.183
What's up?

16:25.193 --> 16:27.321
Where's your bathroom?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.907
Last door on the right.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.393
Ms. Davis, go ahead and meet me
at the washbowl, all right?

16:33.418 --> 16:35.091
- I'll be there in a second.
- All right.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.254
Hold up. Ain't that the bitch
who stole your earrings?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.089
- Keisha...
- Don't "Keish" me.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.771
You're the one
who brought her in here.

16:43.796 --> 16:45.763
- Look, it's fine.
- I'm telling you right now,

16:45.922 --> 16:48.095
if that bitch tries to steal
a motherfucking thing

16:48.257 --> 16:50.476
out this shop,
I'ma beat her flat ass.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.353
<i>Okay.</i>

16:58.184 --> 17:00.482
- She know why I'm here?
- She don't know shit,

17:00.645 --> 17:04.069
and it's gonna stay that way, 'cause
you're gonna keep your mouth shut.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.492
That way,
if shit ever goes down,

17:07.652 --> 17:11.281
'Keisha can say she ain't know nothing,
and it'll be the truth.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.369
Plausible deniability.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.537
I get it.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.839
Guys, let's make sure we have
someone on the front and back entrances

17:20.865 --> 17:23.009
of the club at all times.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.327
All right, thanks, gentlemen.

17:24.352 --> 17:26.340
Dean, can I get a word?

17:26.503 --> 17:28.723
- Absolutely, Mr. St. Patrick.
- Gentlemen.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.059
Look, does your firm
provide personal security?

17:32.218 --> 17:35.142
Like, if you do, could you also
still secure my three clubs?

17:35.304 --> 17:37.352
Of course.
Is it personal detail for you?

17:37.515 --> 17:39.233
- Yeah.
- Has someone threatened you?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.985
Club business.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.646
I got in a feud
with some rival club owners.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.065
You know, it could get messy.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.551
Okay, well, my men would have
no problem looking after you.

17:47.576 --> 17:50.487
They're professionals.
And for a price, of course.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.655
I'd expect nothing less.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.122
Excuse me. Okay.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.004
This is a pleasant surprise,
I must say.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.170
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

18:09.171 --> 18:12.015
I'm not accustomed to people
interrupting me during dinner.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.142
- Sorry.
- But I must say,

18:14.302 --> 18:16.396
I was impressed with the way
you handled yourself.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.023
Well, you know,
you can't spank kids these days.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.604
You gotta put 'em in time out,
you know?

18:21.767 --> 18:23.690
Stern should have
spanked you, then,

18:23.853 --> 18:26.356
for taking back this club
as well as Verbatim and Strive.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.240
Look at you doing your homework.

18:28.399 --> 18:31.073
I heard Madeline Stern
got a few clubs in the divorce.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.704
I met her.
She's not the working type.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.916
I guess you two had
a symbiotic relationship?

18:37.074 --> 18:40.044
We had a common enemy.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.402
Why are you meeting with
the toddlers across the street?

18:42.538 --> 18:44.757
Mutual friends.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.257
And they're hot right now.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.460
I'm planning to refurbish
an old apartment building,

18:51.485 --> 18:53.592
turn it into a luxe eco-hotel.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.307
I'd love to get a bar
or club inside.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.892
I was on the verge of
signing Andy and Alby.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.730
- Until I showed up.
- And now I'm not so sure.

19:02.892 --> 19:06.647
I'm gonna take the next few weeks
to examine you and them individually,

19:06.812 --> 19:09.190
as well as the portfolios
of your nightclubs.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.611
But I got to get to know
you personally

19:12.777 --> 19:14.154
as well as professionally.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.994
I know you can run a club,
and I know you can do a deal,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.079
but who is James St. Patrick?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.585
- That is the question.
- Precisely.

19:21.744 --> 19:24.167
What you see is what you get.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.753
I'm as real as they come.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.171
You burn yourself cooking,
or what?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.270
Don't worry, I don't bite.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.275
I'm a RN at D.C. General.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.313
That's how I met your cousin.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.115
You got to start
cleaning your wounds

19:55.277 --> 19:58.656
and doing hand exercises
so your skin don't tighten.

19:59.865 --> 20:03.711
You don't want to lose use of it.
Don't even wanna try one for me?

20:19.927 --> 20:21.474
I need my meds.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.186
Jukebox says you can't have any.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.567
What she says goes.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.481
That girl been trying to boss people
around since we was kids.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.195
Y'all must have been pretty tight.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.780
I never seen her
let anybody stay here.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.492
She owes me.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.329
I was there for her
when her daddy...

20:44.243 --> 20:46.746
kicked her out
for the way she is.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.171
You her...

20:51.333 --> 20:53.335
Girlfriend?

20:53.502 --> 20:55.379
Yeah.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.298
But I like niggas, too.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.135
Obviously.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.521
What's that you're drinking?

21:03.679 --> 21:05.431
Texas tea.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.396
You want to try a little?

21:07.558 --> 21:09.856
It might make you feel better.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.534
That don't taste like
no damn tea.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.821
It grows on you
after a few sips.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.746
So you told Jukebox
to move to D.C.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.707
and accept who she really is.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.173
That's probably why
she looks up to you so much.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.050
She don't look up to me.

21:33.209 --> 21:36.463
If she looked up to me,
she wouldn't be no damn cop.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.140
Must have been some
real bad shit go down

21:40.299 --> 21:41.659
between you
and whoever jumped you.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.311
You ain't been outside that long.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.690
Might be a little history there.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.563
Is there gonna be a rematch?

21:50.726 --> 21:52.569
Fuck yeah.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.822
I'm just too fucked up...

21:55.898 --> 21:57.696
to go at Ghost.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.117
I mean, ghosts.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.577
'Keisha's definitely got your back.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.337
I saw the way
she was looking at me.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.292
You must've told her
about the earrings.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.210
Why wouldn't I?

22:16.377 --> 22:18.254
You took 'em, didn't you?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.682
Yeah.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.518
I did.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.899
Shit.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.652
Make sure your seatbelt's on.
The police are behind us.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.655
Don't look back.
What the fuck are you doing?

22:36.772 --> 22:39.525
- Just chill.
- I can't. I've got all this cash on me.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.411
I thought we were going to
make deposits at the bank.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.206
Just close your bag
and act normal, okay?

22:58.961 --> 23:00.429
Evening, ma'am.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.215
May I see your license
and registration?

23:13.934 --> 23:16.232
Stopping you because you made
an improper lane change

23:16.395 --> 23:18.755
- about a mile and a half back.
- I'm so, so sorry, Officer.

23:18.780 --> 23:21.450
It's-it's my fault.
Tasha's my nanny.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.049
If she did anything wrong,
it's because I was just rushing her

23:24.074 --> 23:26.698
to get back to my place.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.582
Sorry, sir.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.414
Me did try to do what me boss say.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.544
Me never realize
me never put on the signal.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.835
Well, just...

23:35.998 --> 23:38.842
use your turn signals next time.

23:39.001 --> 23:41.345
- I appreciate that, Officer.
- Okay, watch the road.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.063
- Manners and respect.
- Watch the road.

23:44.465 --> 23:45.557
<i>Okay.</i>

23:50.012 --> 23:52.390
We got it on good authority
that the drugs we gave you

23:52.556 --> 23:54.116
have been stepped on
and turned to shit.

23:54.141 --> 23:57.694
What business is it of yours
once you deliver the product to us?

23:57.853 --> 24:00.857
Technically, it's not,
but if you're selling garbage,

24:01.023 --> 24:03.321
someone's gonna get dead,
and then the cops come,

24:03.484 --> 24:05.578
they trace this shit,
we both lose.

24:05.736 --> 24:08.364
I can't hear a word
over this shit.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.033
Will someone go up there
and pull this guy's fucking plug?

24:11.200 --> 24:14.545
I have no knowledge of
what you're talking about.

24:14.703 --> 24:15.875
I believe you,

24:16.038 --> 24:17.598
and you've been in the game
a lot longer than me,

24:17.623 --> 24:19.433
so I ain't gonna tell you
how to run your business,

24:19.458 --> 24:21.258
but who's ever doing this
in your organization

24:21.283 --> 24:23.429
is actually withholding
the extra cash they're making

24:23.587 --> 24:25.840
by selling this diluted product.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.811
If what you say is true,

24:34.974 --> 24:39.354
then this all occurred
because you make a promise

24:39.520 --> 24:41.989
and you did not deliver.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.361
We dealing with that
drug situation as we speak.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.455
But I need you to right this wrong,

24:50.614 --> 24:52.958
so the two of us can have
a long partnership,

24:53.117 --> 24:55.495
making money for years to come.

25:01.041 --> 25:04.170
Don't worry about it.
I will look into it.

25:20.561 --> 25:23.440
If you think we're leaving before this,
you're fucking nuts.

the "Driving Miss Daisy" routine.

25:34.825 --> 25:37.578
And it worked.
It totally fucking worked.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.669
Even though I nearly lost my shit
seeing you go all Miss Cleo.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.135
I've always been good at,
you know,

25:45.294 --> 25:47.422
doing voices, imitating people.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.590
I didn't know that.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.018
Holly, there's a lot that
we don't know about each other.

25:57.306 --> 26:00.355
Can you do a Tommy impression?

26:00.517 --> 26:03.817
Oh, yeah, I probably can.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.323
All you got to do
is make a bunch of faces

26:06.482 --> 26:08.405

26:08.567 --> 26:09.819
"Yo, Tash. Yo, Tash."

26:09.985 --> 26:12.065
I'm about to cancel Christmas
on these motherfuckers.

"Yeah, you got any more
hushpuppies up in here?"

26:14.364 --> 26:16.662
ls that supposed to be me?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.668
- Yeah.
- I don't fucking sound like that.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.670
"I don't fucking sound like that."

26:20.829 --> 26:22.829
I'm glad you two are
getting along so well together

26:22.854 --> 26:24.625
while I'm busting my ass out here.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.840
We're getting shit set up, a'ight?

26:27.002 --> 26:28.970
Actually, we were busy
getting pulled over.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.643
- What?
- We handled it.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.597
- What?
- It's like we used to say,

26:38.764 --> 26:41.267
they ain't see shit,
we ain't say shit...

26:41.433 --> 26:43.652
So it ain't shit.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.530
All right, it's time for me
to get home to my kids.

26:46.688 --> 26:47.860
I'll see y'all.

26:48.023 --> 26:51.573
How are they doing
with Ghost gone?

26:51.735 --> 26:53.655
Yo, look, baby,
she don't want to talk about him.

26:53.810 --> 26:55.090
And you know what? Neither do I.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.450
You know what?
Honestly, this whole situation

26:57.616 --> 27:00.870
has been a bit rough on all of us,
but we're taking it day by day.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.710
I can't believe anyone
would do this to their family.

27:03.872 --> 27:07.046
I mean, what'd he do, go get
a new apartment or something?

27:07.209 --> 27:09.758
Nah, he moved in with his bitch.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.718
What a dick.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.805
All right. I'm out, y'all.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.765
I'll see you tomorrow.

27:16.927 --> 27:20.522
Holly, don't forget we're gonna meet
at the bank at 9:00 in the morning.

27:20.681 --> 27:23.275
- I'll be there.
- All right, thanks.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.529
You hear that?

27:27.688 --> 27:30.612
Ghost is gonna be at Angela's.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.868
You could get him there.

So how was he?

28:08.270 --> 28:11.365
- Slow, I bet.
- We ain't fuck.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.783
- Why not?
- That nigga was in no condition to fuck.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.698
So I turned him on
to some of that lean.

28:19.865 --> 28:23.290
I'm trying to wean him off the drugs
to get him to come clean.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.204
It got a little good to him.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.793
He said something
about getting back at ghosts.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.970
Not ghosts.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.631
Ghost.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.892
He let that book-smart
motherfucker beat him?

28:45.057 --> 28:48.311
- What else he say?
- Nothing.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.822
I did good, right?

29:03.408 --> 29:05.831
You got lucky.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.845
Don't ever go against
my wishes again.

29:32.354 --> 29:35.198
Maybe Kanan can't get excited,
but you sure are.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.286
Juke.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.334
Please.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.808
- It was a beautiful apartment, Jamie.
- Yeah?

30:05.971 --> 30:07.723
Lots of room for the kids.

30:07.889 --> 30:11.689
- Privacy for us.
- Sounds good.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.071
You know what?
I might be able to afford that, too.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.823
I had a meeting with
Karen Bassett yesterday.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.404
Who's that?

30:18.567 --> 30:20.740
Well, she is a hotelier
who's interested

30:20.902 --> 30:23.102
in putting one of my clubs
in a new space she's opening.

30:23.127 --> 30:24.747
I'm talking bigger
than Simon Stern.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.704
Who's Simon Stern?

30:26.867 --> 30:28.744
More like international
opportunities.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.083
Beast.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.839
Yeah.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.715
Jamie, I think I forgot
something at home.

30:40.881 --> 30:43.725
All right, we'll just shoot you
back around to your house.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.284
No, no, it's okay, I've got
a couple of calls I have to make.

30:46.428 --> 30:47.788
I'll catch up with you after work.

30:47.929 --> 30:48.930
- Sure?
- Yeah.

30:49.014 --> 30:51.062
All right, walk safe. Bye.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.991
What the fuck are you still
doing following me around?

31:03.153 --> 31:04.953
I wasn't following you.
I was following Ghost.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.708
- Oh, God, not again with this shit.
- "This shit"?

31:08.867 --> 31:11.620
What are you looking for?

31:11.787 --> 31:14.381
A gun?
You're gonna shoot me, Angela?

31:14.539 --> 31:16.212
Get the fuck off me
before I scream,

31:16.375 --> 31:18.798
NYPD catches you, and I tell Mike
you're still stalking me.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.007
Okay, go ahead.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.810
Please, tell the whole department
that you're still fucking the guy

31:22.835 --> 31:24.803
who stole
the Isabel Ruiz sketch, Angela.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.849
You're making this too easy.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.854
Moving St. Patrick
into your place

31:30.013 --> 31:32.107
like you got
carte fucking blanche, really?

31:33.225 --> 31:34.727
He's clean.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.691
Well, that's what he told you,
I bet, yeah.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.981
But...

31:39.147 --> 31:41.320
Nope. He is...

31:41.483 --> 31:43.485
still up to his old tricks.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.656
This is him outside
of Tommy Egan's.

31:49.157 --> 31:52.502
Why would a guy out of the life
drag himself back into it

31:52.661 --> 31:54.334
by hanging out
with a known drug dealer?

31:54.496 --> 31:55.998
It's...

31:56.164 --> 31:59.008
I bet he didn't tell you
he was still talking to Egan.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.171
Oh, Angela.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.431
Trouble in paradise?

32:05.340 --> 32:07.388
So you're following him, too.

32:09.177 --> 32:12.807
That would be
law enforcement misconduct,

32:12.973 --> 32:15.053
except you're not law enforcement
right now, are you?

32:15.183 --> 32:17.436
Back off. You're right.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.446
I can't out you to Mike,

32:20.605 --> 32:23.529
but if you get caught,
I won't have to.

32:24.568 --> 32:27.196
But for me to get caught,
you'd have to warn St. Patrick

32:27.362 --> 32:29.285
that I'm onto him, but l...

32:29.448 --> 32:32.372
I don't think
you're gonna do that.

32:32.534 --> 32:35.458
I bet you're afraid of
what he might do.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.547
That thing almost looks real.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.886
Bro, it is real.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.048
My mom was about to clean my room,
so I had to find

32:49.073 --> 32:51.561
- another hiding spot for it.
- So you brought it to school?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.840
- Where'd you even get that thing?
- Man, just shut up

32:53.865 --> 32:55.265
and help me find a spot to hide it.

32:55.290 --> 32:56.391
Hey, YOU guys.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.435
Get inside.
What are you doing back here?

32:58.602 --> 33:00.900
You smoking or something?

33:01.062 --> 33:02.484
What? No.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.445
This is AUSA Angela Valdes.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.404
What?

33:57.369 --> 33:59.337
What's going on, T.?
Kids all right?

33:59.496 --> 34:01.373
Raina's fine,

34:01.540 --> 34:04.009
but they're saying Tariq
brought a gun to school.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.293
- A what?
- I know.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.554
- Hell no.
- Yeah, well,

34:07.712 --> 34:11.056
the gym teacher said he found Tariq
and his friend Calvin outside with it.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.310
Tariq already admitted
that the gun was his.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.614
Tariq ain't got no gun.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.652
But you do.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.992
Really?

34:33.154 --> 34:35.754
You know I ain't careless enough
to leave my shit laying around...

34:35.779 --> 34:38.080
Tell me how else he got it, Tash.
Sure as hell wasn't me.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.166
You kicked me out, remember?

34:43.665 --> 34:45.884
Mr. and Mrs. St. Patrick.

34:46.042 --> 34:49.012
Ms. Chambers, my wife and I,
we profusely apologize.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.592
I don't know
how my son got a gun.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.757
We don't allow them
in our home at all.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.097
The police told us
that the gun is registered

34:55.260 --> 34:57.888
to a Department of
Justice employee,

34:58.054 --> 35:01.979
an AUSA named Angela Valdes.

35:04.394 --> 35:08.115
The police want to know,
did he steal it from somewhere?

35:09.399 --> 35:11.948
No, we know who she is.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.364
Tariq has been in fights at school,
and now he's brought a weapon,

35:15.530 --> 35:17.874
which, as you know,
is an automatic expulsion,

35:18.033 --> 35:20.331
so there really isn't much
of a conversation here.

35:20.493 --> 35:23.337
There's always
a conversation to be had.

35:23.496 --> 35:26.545
- Especially at this school.
- Mrs. St. Patrick...

35:26.708 --> 35:28.551
Deanna Steinberg's parents
had a conversation

35:28.710 --> 35:31.179
when she got caught
changing grades in the system.

35:31.338 --> 35:34.808
Shawn Gardner was busted for stealing
money out the vending machine.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.219
Those are nonviolent incidents.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.433
I get it.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.064
The black kid gets expelled,

35:41.222 --> 35:43.566
but Michelle Batten
and Jenny West don't,

35:43.725 --> 35:48.356
after they assaulted the girl on
the lacrosse team with their sticks.

35:50.649 --> 35:54.495
Look, Mrs. St. Patrick,
there may be a way to keep Tariq

35:54.653 --> 35:59.124
enrolled at this school,
but the requirements will be severe.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.751
I wouldn't have expected it
any other way.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.838
'Riq, wait for me downstairs.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.424
Listen, you were great in there.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.261
Yeah?
And you were no help at all.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.305
How the hell did
he get Angela's gun?

36:19.594 --> 36:21.634
I don't know, Tasha.
I wasn't there the whole night.

36:21.659 --> 36:23.457
- I went to...
- What the fuck do you mean,

36:23.619 --> 36:25.100
- you weren't there?
- Tasha.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.314
What do you mean
you weren't there the whole night?

36:27.477 --> 36:30.321
You left my kids alone
with that woman?

36:30.480 --> 36:32.290
- That was not part of the deal.
- Look, I'm sorry, okay?

36:32.315 --> 36:34.075
I had to go see Tommy.
It was a sudden thing.

36:34.241 --> 36:35.885
I don't give a fuck. You should
have brought 'em home first.

36:35.910 --> 36:36.779
Tasha.

36:36.945 --> 36:40.199
But it's a good thing we won't have
to have this conversation again.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.787
You know why?

36:41.950 --> 36:44.350
Because my kids won't be staying
at that bitch's house again.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.491
- Tasha, be reasonable, okay?
- I'm being reasonable.

36:46.516 --> 36:47.956
I'm gonna take Tariq home,

36:48.123 --> 36:51.218
and we can talk to him there
later tonight.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.844
Medina.

37:01.970 --> 37:04.130
The fuck are you doing
in this neck of the woods, Knox?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.145
It's nice to see you,
too, Medina.

37:06.307 --> 37:08.275
- You good?
- All good, man, what's up?

37:08.435 --> 37:10.483
- Want to walk with me real quick?
- Yeah.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.234
- What's going on?
- Working the Lobos case.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.492
Figured you'd want in.

37:16.651 --> 37:19.154
Are you still riding the short bus?
Lobos is dead.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.664
Right, well, I'm...

37:21.823 --> 37:24.702
I'm trying to build a case on
James St. Patrick as the distributor.

37:24.868 --> 37:27.246
AUSAs...
they don't want to go after him.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.335
They think Thomas Egan
is their guy.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.337
Yeah, I heard you guys
had Egan dead to rights,

37:31.374 --> 37:33.894
- and he got sprung on a technicality.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.213
Egan's not the guy.
I know it's St. Patrick, all right?

37:36.379 --> 37:39.223
Only problem is,
the only other person

37:39.382 --> 37:42.181
who can confirm that St. Patrick
is the distributor is Vibora Ruiz.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.845
Now...

37:44.012 --> 37:46.356
I was hoping maybe you could use
some of your DEA contacts,

37:46.514 --> 37:48.357
help me find him?

37:48.516 --> 37:51.861
Why aren't you using any of
your contacts at Southern District?

37:52.020 --> 37:54.739
I'm trying to make sure Angela Valdes
comes nowhere near this thing.

37:54.898 --> 37:57.697
She's unfortunately
been compromised.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.829
- Fuck that toxic bitch.
- Right.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.787
All right. I'll make some calls.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.328
- I'll get back at you.
- You're a good man.

38:08.495 --> 38:09.997
Have a good day.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.797
- Why would you bring a gun to school?
- I only took it for protection.

38:13.963 --> 38:16.216
Shawn got shot, so I thought
it could happen to me, too.

38:16.382 --> 38:19.055
At your private school
on the Upper East Side?

38:20.048 --> 38:23.177
White kids shoot at schools all the time.
Read the news.

38:23.343 --> 38:26.392
Did you just disrespect
your mother?

38:26.554 --> 38:28.898
Sit your behind up.
Get up. Sit up!

38:32.477 --> 38:34.400
I'm not playing with you tonight.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.485
I'm not playing, either.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.488
Dad, you're not here
to protect nobody no more.

38:38.513 --> 38:41.062
Boy, don't try it.
Don't try to put this on us.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.536
Tariq, look at me.

38:50.411 --> 38:53.915
Part of being a man is accepting the
consequences of your actions, okay?

38:54.082 --> 38:56.210
Now, you got to go to therapy
for the next year.

38:56.376 --> 38:59.425
On top of that, your mother and I have
decided to put you on punishment.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.266
No TV, no video games, no iPad,
no iPhone, no nothing.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.944
I don't want to hear
anything about it.

39:05.104 --> 39:06.856
Matter of fact,
give me your phone now.

39:07.022 --> 39:08.642
- No.
- "No"?

39:08.805 --> 39:10.807
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

39:10.974 --> 39:13.944
Give your father the phone.
Did you not hear what I just said?

39:14.102 --> 39:16.821
Give your father the phone.

39:27.949 --> 39:29.951
You know why
he's acting out like this, right?

39:30.118 --> 39:32.470
If he didn't get caught with that gun,
would you be here tonight?

39:32.495 --> 39:34.293
Tasha, that's not an excuse.
You kidding me?

39:34.455 --> 39:36.298
It's up to you and I
to make them understand

39:36.457 --> 39:37.959
the repercussions of
their decisions.

39:38.126 --> 39:40.845
And of your decisions, too.

39:46.009 --> 39:48.762
Good night, Ghost.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.024
Good night.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.572
Why the hell did you have an unsecured
weapon around my kids, Angie?

41:22.730 --> 41:25.404
Jamie, I am so sorry.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.618
I wasn't able to put my gun
back in the safe

41:31.781 --> 41:35.331
because you brought the kids over
earlier than we discussed.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.587
- So it's my fault now?
- I'm not blaming anyone.

41:39.038 --> 41:43.043
I put my bag on the top shelf of
the closet and I closed the door.

41:44.752 --> 41:47.426
What was Tariq doing going through
my things in the first place?

41:47.588 --> 41:49.465
He's a boy.
That's what they do, Angela.

41:49.632 --> 41:51.475
They get into shit.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.729
But l... I don't have kids.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.645
You don't, do you?

41:59.684 --> 42:02.187
So I guess snooping
through my shit is hereditary?

42:12.530 --> 42:15.033
The whole fucking situation's
been tough on everyone,

42:15.199 --> 42:17.122
so we should just step away.

42:25.251 --> 42:28.721
Why were you carrying a gun...
in the first place?

42:28.880 --> 42:33.101
I'm an AUSA.
I work high-risk cases.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.599
Have you seen Tommy lately?

42:40.767 --> 42:42.314
No.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.653
I went by his house.

42:52.278 --> 42:53.996
He wasn't there.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.663
I called him on his phone,
Angela.

42:58.826 --> 43:01.170
Same result.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.081
He don't want to see me.

43:03.247 --> 43:04.715
That's what this
whole thing's about?

43:04.874 --> 43:06.968
Your case,
the case you're working?

43:08.669 --> 43:09.670
Let me get this straight.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.849
I ask about a gun,
and you fucking ask about Tommy.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.726
We agreed not to talk about
this anymore.

43:15.885 --> 43:19.640
Yep, and here we are, yet again.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.617
I had to pick...

43:40.827 --> 43:42.829
between Tommy...

43:43.329 --> 43:45.252
and you.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.043
I picked you.

43:59.929 --> 44:02.682
I'm sorry about the gun.
I really am.

44:10.731 --> 44:13.200
Maybe we pushed
the kid thing too fast.

44:15.903 --> 44:19.282
Yeah, maybe I should hang out
with the kids alone for a while first.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.663
What do you say
I make us some dinner?

44:24.829 --> 44:26.376
Sound good?

44:27.331 --> 44:29.254
<i>Okay.</i>

44:59.780 --> 45:03.034
Calm down before you get yourself
all worked up over nothing.

45:03.201 --> 45:04.623
Nothing?

45:04.785 --> 45:06.465
You killed two people
right in front of me.

45:06.490 --> 45:07.960
Oh, no, I didn't kill two people.

45:08.122 --> 45:10.295
I saved your fucking life.

45:10.458 --> 45:11.835
You shot Wookie.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.469
You just shot him
like he was a dog.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.788
Dogs need to know not to bite
the hand that feeds them.

45:16.631 --> 45:18.791
A'ight, you know what?
This isn't what I signed up for.

45:18.816 --> 45:20.969
Dirt, listen to me.

45:21.135 --> 45:24.514
Everything is gonna be okay.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.728
I'm a cop, remember?

45:26.891 --> 45:31.146
I'm gonna monitor the situation
and make sure nothing else happens.

45:32.813 --> 45:37.114
- No, I think I should walk away.
- We're talking about one job here.

45:37.276 --> 45:40.746
A job that could cover
all your college tuition,

45:40.905 --> 45:43.505
unless you want to be paying
Sallie Mae for the rest of your life.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.703
I don't know, Jukebox.

45:47.870 --> 45:49.167
I'm gonna go home.

45:49.330 --> 45:50.770
I'll call you when
I make up my mind.

45:50.795 --> 45:51.882
Dirt.

45:52.041 --> 45:53.588
The fuck are you up to, Jukebox?

45:53.751 --> 45:56.174
Whatever you doing with this nigga,
you need to rethink it,

45:56.337 --> 45:57.930
because his bitch ass ain't ready.

45:58.089 --> 46:00.842
Let him go home.
And come up off my pills.

46:01.008 --> 46:02.760
You still haven't come clean.

46:02.927 --> 46:06.682
And I ain't no bitch-ass nigga,
and who the fuck are you, Two-Face?

46:06.847 --> 46:08.440
You fried and burnt
like a pork rind.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.695
Come on, Dirt.

46:16.857 --> 46:17.983
Come on.

46:21.195 --> 46:23.368
Let me walk you out.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.423
Yeah, bro. Take that shit.

47:19.587 --> 47:22.761
You 'bout to get
your limey ass taken out.

47:22.923 --> 47:25.267
In your face. That's a bitch.

47:26.927 --> 47:30.147
Take that in your face
with that mace case.

47:30.306 --> 47:32.024
Oh, baby, you getting hungry?

47:34.518 --> 47:36.771
I don't want food, Tommy.

47:40.107 --> 47:42.781
I want to know
what you're doing about Ghost.

47:42.943 --> 47:44.983
But, Holly, I don't want to talk
about that tonight.

47:45.112 --> 47:46.785
Well, when do you want
to talk about it?

47:50.618 --> 47:52.461
Lobos killed our dog, Tommy.

47:52.620 --> 47:53.963
Okay?

47:54.121 --> 47:55.998
The next time,
it's gonna be you or me.

47:56.165 --> 47:58.964
Nothing's gonna happen to us.
I promise.

47:59.126 --> 48:00.606
You want me to
just trust you on that?

48:00.631 --> 48:03.225
Like when you told me
Bell was just missing?

48:06.050 --> 48:08.269
Hold up.

48:09.637 --> 48:11.184
Are you fucking serious right now?

48:11.347 --> 48:13.725
- Who is texting you?
- It's Tariq.

48:13.891 --> 48:16.144
He got in trouble at school today.

48:16.310 --> 48:19.234
Are you gonna answer my question?

48:20.981 --> 48:23.780
Fuck, Holly, he snuck out the house.

48:23.943 --> 48:26.822
He's at Basketball City.

48:26.987 --> 48:29.160
So call Tasha to pick him up.

48:29.323 --> 48:30.916
Yo, I can't leave my little man.

48:31.075 --> 48:34.170
Ain't gonna be left hanging by me,
especially with Ghost MIA.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.501
Holly, he came to me.

48:36.664 --> 48:39.087
What if Lobos is out there
looking for you?

48:39.250 --> 48:41.093
Listen, I'm gonna be
careful, okay?

48:41.252 --> 48:43.004
But I cannot let Tariq get hurt.

48:43.170 --> 48:46.515
Now, you just sit that fine little Pilates
ass down right here on this couch,

48:46.674 --> 48:49.302
and you stay here until I get back.

48:58.394 --> 49:00.897
You stole from me.

49:01.063 --> 49:04.192
As much as I hate the Japanese...

49:05.192 --> 49:08.742
the yakuza have a few good ideas.

49:26.714 --> 49:29.968
- Thought you was a cop.
- I am.

49:32.678 --> 49:35.272
Ain't no cop gonna need
no squirrel like that.

49:36.015 --> 49:37.733
What's the job?

49:41.228 --> 49:43.230
It must've been pretty important...

49:44.064 --> 49:45.941
that you stepped all over me.

49:46.108 --> 49:48.031
And I'd do it again.

49:51.155 --> 49:52.828
You were out of line.

49:52.990 --> 49:56.415
You fucked up,
and you were right.

49:56.577 --> 49:58.454
I need him.

50:00.247 --> 50:02.875
Well, whatever you got going on,
I want in on it.

50:03.042 --> 50:05.261
You still haven't told me the truth.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.592
Whatever the fuck you're into,

50:07.755 --> 50:10.008
whoever did this to you.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.596
Bangers, law enforcement.

50:11.759 --> 50:14.603
Either way, they come down
here to find you,

50:14.762 --> 50:17.766
it could fuck up my whole job,
and I ain't having that.

50:17.932 --> 50:20.481
The truth, now.

50:20.643 --> 50:24.147
- I already told your girlfriend.
- No, nigga, I want the truth.

50:24.313 --> 50:27.112
I want to know
what the fuck happened to Shawn.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.947
I ain't got shit to say.

50:37.535 --> 50:41.039
You don't think I could find out
your son was murdered

50:41.205 --> 50:43.378
just about the time
you came calling me for help?

50:45.209 --> 50:47.462
I can't believe you actually lying,

50:47.628 --> 50:49.630
to me of all people.

50:55.803 --> 50:58.397
You ain't black no more.
You blue.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.479
Which is why I can help.

51:03.644 --> 51:06.193
I got access to every fucking thing.

51:09.817 --> 51:13.117
Motherfucker,
I was the call you made

51:13.279 --> 51:15.247
when you dropped your first body.

51:15.406 --> 51:18.410
You were the first person to know
I fuck with girls.

51:18.576 --> 51:20.829
Now we gonna
play each other like this?

51:26.792 --> 51:29.671
Candie didn't know
what you meant by "Ghost."

51:32.131 --> 51:34.133
I do.

51:35.426 --> 51:37.645
That motherfucker
did this to you?

51:40.347 --> 51:42.600
Man, Ghost,
he was your boy, that kid.

51:44.101 --> 51:47.025
Always with his head
in a motherfucking book.

51:47.187 --> 51:49.815
Vicious with a piece, though.

51:50.608 --> 51:52.702
Y'all fell out?

51:52.860 --> 51:55.454
He was the reason
why I went inside.

51:56.697 --> 51:59.450
And he took care of Shawn
all that time.

52:00.367 --> 52:03.496
You got out.
You told Shawn the truth.

52:04.538 --> 52:07.212
Shawn turned against Ghost.

52:09.376 --> 52:11.174
He killed Shawn, right?

52:15.633 --> 52:17.806
Did you know Ghost
was gonna do it?

52:19.386 --> 52:21.730
What happened?

52:21.889 --> 52:24.733
Did you not get there in time?

52:24.892 --> 52:27.065
Or maybe you just
didn't show up at all.

52:27.227 --> 52:30.071
- Were you afraid?
- Fuck no.

52:30.230 --> 52:31.732
I ain't afraid of no fucking body.

52:31.899 --> 52:34.618
Then why would you
send your son in there

52:34.777 --> 52:37.451
against a man you raised up
to be a gangster?

52:37.613 --> 52:38.910
You knew better.

52:39.073 --> 52:41.246
That kid ain't had no street in him.

52:41.408 --> 52:44.252
You knew Ghost was gonna kill him.
You knew it.

52:45.245 --> 52:48.044
How could you let that happen?

52:50.250 --> 52:52.503
Ghost didn't kill Shawn.

52:54.630 --> 52:56.883
I did. I pulled the trigger.

52:57.591 --> 52:59.935
He picked Ghost over me.

53:03.222 --> 53:05.850
Like you just did with that kid.

53:11.730 --> 53:14.199
You did what you had to do.

53:15.651 --> 53:18.746
When Shawn picked the other side,
he was the enemy.

53:21.448 --> 53:25.794
Dirt needed a show of loyalty,
so he would stay loyal to me.

53:25.953 --> 53:28.126
Shawn wasn't loyal...

53:28.288 --> 53:29.928
and I ain't saying
you should've shot him.

53:29.953 --> 53:33.332
That's your son, you brought him into
the world, but you ain't raised Shawn.

53:34.795 --> 53:39.642
Ghost did.
He's ultimately responsible.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.802
Shawn was a pawn.

53:42.636 --> 53:46.732
You sacrifice pawns
for the greater good.

53:54.356 --> 53:56.779
Can I have some of that tea now?

53:57.943 --> 54:00.196
You said you wanted the truth.

54:00.362 --> 54:02.285
You got it.

54:08.412 --> 54:10.380
No more secrets between us.

54:10.539 --> 54:12.633
No more secrets.

54:22.342 --> 54:23.764
What about the job?

54:23.927 --> 54:26.726
I got something cooking,

54:26.889 --> 54:29.813
but you're not up for it yet,
down an arm.

54:30.684 --> 54:33.437
First thing we got to do
is get you on your feet.

54:35.689 --> 54:37.612
Well, you know me, cuz,
I'm with whatever.

54:43.405 --> 54:46.329
I'm here.

54:46.867 --> 54:49.620
Where you at?

54:49.787 --> 54:51.960
Tariq-osaurus.

54:56.376 --> 54:58.128
I should've known it was you.

54:59.379 --> 55:02.303
I thought we established
I don't like people playing on my phone.

55:02.466 --> 55:04.106
Look, man, I knew
you'd show up for Tariq.

55:04.272 --> 55:05.752
You're a good uncle,
Tommy, all right?

55:05.857 --> 55:07.312
Yeah, you're damn right.

55:10.808 --> 55:13.357
Lobos wants me dead.

55:19.858 --> 55:22.077
What are you talking about?

55:22.236 --> 55:26.116
He's locked up.
He's fucking desperate.

55:26.281 --> 55:28.761
He fucking figured out it was me
that tried to kill him, right?

55:28.786 --> 55:30.629
I don't know what
that crazy bastard thinks.

55:30.788 --> 55:32.579
But you...
you're working for him.

55:32.746 --> 55:34.248
Why do you think he hired you?

55:34.414 --> 55:37.134
Because you ain't the only motherfucker
who knows how to push weight.

55:37.159 --> 55:39.753
Or Lobos needs you
for another reason.

55:39.920 --> 55:43.174
- Well, what reason is that?
- I think he used you.

55:44.341 --> 55:46.343
He used you to lure me
to the park that night.

55:46.510 --> 55:49.263
The only reason I'm standing
right here talking to you right now

55:49.429 --> 55:50.931
is because you made it stop.

55:52.391 --> 55:54.735
So I'm saying we should
fucking work together, man.

55:55.602 --> 55:57.946
You know?
Ghost and fucking Tommy.

55:58.105 --> 56:00.028
And bring that
motherfucker down.

56:01.066 --> 56:03.990
He's my enemy.
That makes him your enemy.

56:04.152 --> 56:07.656
He tries to kill me...
you're next, brother.

56:07.823 --> 56:10.793
You don't know.
He needs me, Ghost.

56:13.328 --> 56:15.672
He needs you for now, Tommy.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.675
What happens when you
fucking make a mistake?

56:18.834 --> 56:21.212
"When" I make a mistake?

56:21.378 --> 56:23.301
Not "if"?

56:24.464 --> 56:27.263
- Tommy...
- No, no, no. You're done.

56:29.636 --> 56:31.934
You're still the same...

56:32.806 --> 56:34.604
Ghost.

56:38.312 --> 56:39.985
Tommy, you saved me.

56:40.147 --> 56:41.945
All right? Let me save us both.

56:45.903 --> 56:48.156
Is Lobos coming after me?

56:53.660 --> 56:56.254
Good-bye, Ghost.
