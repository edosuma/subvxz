00:45.145 --> 00:46.772
Now I lay me down to sleep.

00:46.813 --> 00:49.008
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.677
Pop, I guess you're up there
in heaven...

00:51.718 --> 00:53.515
so you know
I'm a little nervous.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.612
Tomorrow's my first day
of college.

00:55.655 --> 00:57.555
I really wish you were here.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.524
And, Pop, about that party...

00:59.559 --> 01:01.652
You were right to whup my ass.

02:02.055 --> 02:07.755
This final exam is truly
an extraordinary piece of work.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.818
This student has succinctly
summarized everything...

02:09.863 --> 02:12.195
he's learned here
at this university...

02:12.232 --> 02:13.392
Nothing!

02:17.971 --> 02:19.097
You fucked up!

02:19.139 --> 02:22.040
Christopher,
you've wasted your mind...

02:22.075 --> 02:26.774
and a mind
is a terrible thing to waste.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.577
Do you know what your punishment
is going to be?

02:30.817 --> 02:32.808
The Deans...

02:32.852 --> 02:34.513
of Discipline!

02:36.789 --> 02:40.555
And we're gonna kick
your fuckin' ass.

02:41.828 --> 02:42.988
Help!

02:52.939 --> 02:54.497
No. Me, Play.

02:54.541 --> 02:55.906
Are you having a nightmare?

02:55.942 --> 02:57.842
You been keeping me up
all night.

02:57.877 --> 02:59.310
What the hell's wrong?

03:00.280 --> 03:01.406
It was for real.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.409
I dreamed I was in college.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.151
I messed up real bad.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.748
See? A nightmare, man.
That's your sign.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.257
You shouldn't go.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.425
Listen.

03:15.461 --> 03:18.021
Boy, I'm trying to make you
a responsible person.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.691
Damn, I'm late.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.331
You know something?

03:26.372 --> 03:28.306
You'd forget your dick
if it wasn't screwed on.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.571
I'm sorry.
I'm just running late.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.776
You know, I'm really gonna
miss this place.

03:36.816 --> 03:40.115
After Pops died, I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

03:40.153 --> 03:43.850
You're the most disorganized
human being I know.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.558
Your folks were great
for letting me stay here.

03:47.594 --> 03:48.891
Yo, man, you don't gotta go.

03:48.928 --> 03:51.362
The way we kicked it at
the community center last week...

03:51.397 --> 03:55.299
We had the girls screaming.
The skins were in.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.530
- You want to watch the car?
- It was hype, I guess.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.697
I don't understand what's going
on with this college thing.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.536
Who knows who could have been
at the center that night?

04:01.574 --> 04:04.099
One of those talent scouts...
You know, for them producers?

04:04.143 --> 04:05.371
We could get paid.

04:06.112 --> 04:09.946
Not every successful person
went to college.

04:09.983 --> 04:13.475
Play, you know I promised Pops.
Why you sweatin' me, man?

04:13.519 --> 04:15.316
Oh, I gotta go get my picture.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.017
I'll get your picture.
Just straighten up.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.216
You're making me look bad.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.753
I couldn't sleep last night.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.095
Our first day of college.
Can you believe it?

04:27.133 --> 04:29.294
I couldn't sleep last night,
either.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.700
You sure you still want to go?

04:30.737 --> 04:33.035
Kid, what are you talking about?
This is a whole new world.

04:33.072 --> 04:35.267
New people, new experiences.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.333
A roommate.
She's an upperclassman.

04:37.377 --> 04:40.005
I can't wait to meet her.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.638
Yeah, new rules.

04:41.681 --> 04:42.807
No curfew.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.841
You do plan to learn something,
don't you?

04:45.885 --> 04:48.012
Yeah, I guess.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.851
I'm gonna be late
for my grandma...

04:49.889 --> 04:52.323
and you are gonna be late
for the church.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.757
I'll see you on campus.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.928
Oh, oh, before you go...

04:56.963 --> 04:58.123
It's just a little something...

04:59.165 --> 05:01.030
a little something
I wanted to give you.

05:01.067 --> 05:04.730
Let those guys at college
know whose girl you are.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.069
This is so nice. Thank you.

05:07.106 --> 05:08.266
See you later.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.819
Ain't you giving me something
to let people know I'm your man?

05:23.656 --> 05:25.749
We're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.725
When I was in the house,
I was just thinking.

05:31.764 --> 05:32.890
What, Play?

05:32.932 --> 05:35.958
Is school really worth
breaking up a team like we got?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.367
What are you talking about?

05:37.403 --> 05:38.563
Could you keep your feet
on the mat?

05:38.604 --> 05:39.764
Oh, sorry.

05:53.453 --> 05:57.253
This is a great day
for First Corinthians Church.

05:57.290 --> 06:00.088
- Amen.
- Amen.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.390
A great day for this community.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.855
But most important, a great day
for young Christopher.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.194
We are very proud of you.

06:14.006 --> 06:17.271
You have suffered the tragic
loss of your father...

06:17.310 --> 06:19.369
but you have not lost your way.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.541
We are proud because
you have taken the high road...

06:23.583 --> 06:25.710
and not the low road...

06:25.752 --> 06:27.151
unlike some
of our other youngsters...

06:27.186 --> 06:29.086
who shall remain nameless.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.383
Today...

06:31.424 --> 06:34.018
we are sending one young man...

06:34.060 --> 06:36.722
from this fortress of Jesus
to a citadel of higher learning.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.928
So...

06:39.966 --> 06:42.332
In honor of his father

06:42.368 --> 06:44.302
Who was loved by this church

06:46.038 --> 06:48.836
Christopher Robinson Jr.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.240
Why don't you come on up?

07:06.659 --> 07:08.786
I want to thank all of you...

07:09.829 --> 07:12.195
for making it possible for me
to go to college.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.356
That was my pop's dream.

07:17.737 --> 07:20.968
I know if he were here,
he'd be very proud of me...

07:22.241 --> 07:25.472
and very grateful to all of you
for putting your trust in me.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.441
I won't let you down.

07:42.361 --> 07:45.489
Sheila, they just rolled in.
Yeah, cool.

07:45.531 --> 07:48.193
I think everything's gonna
just go smooth.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.039
What are we doing at your job?

07:54.073 --> 07:56.837
I thought you took the day off
to drive me to school.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.605
A little surprise for my man.

08:00.746 --> 08:02.407
What?

08:02.448 --> 08:04.473
Not what, who,
and if I told your ass...

08:04.517 --> 08:07.042
it wouldn't be a surprise,
so do me a favor...

08:07.086 --> 08:09.145
and come on.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.715
Wait a minute.
What about my stuff?

08:13.759 --> 08:16.887
Kid, it'll be OK.
I don't see the junk man coming.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.159
Oh, that's real funny, Play.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.563
Just 'cause you got a ride
named ForPlay...

08:20.600 --> 08:22.625
don't mean you gotta start
dissing my shit.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.068
ForPlay... What kind of name
is that for a car, anyway?

08:25.104 --> 08:26.264
Just come on.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.097
Hold up. My scholarship check.

08:41.386 --> 08:43.412
She's the one
that discovered The Boyz.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.048
- For real?
- Word.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.083
Her scout was in the house
at the community center.

08:48.127 --> 08:49.958
She can get us in the studio...

08:49.996 --> 08:51.520
even get us a phat record deal.

08:51.564 --> 08:53.862
Don't blow this for me, man.
Come on.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.868
Yeah, my eight o'clock.

08:55.902 --> 08:58.166
- Good. Thank you.
- Didn't I give you inventory?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.330
Get to work.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.703
Kid 'N Play.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.230
Sheila Landreaux.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.708
Rick played me the tape
you sent.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.178
Rick... That's her talent scout.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.613
All the big names have scouts.
Remember that.

09:09.649 --> 09:12.618
And, frankly,
I got very excited.

09:12.652 --> 09:13.949
And I've heard a lot of stuff.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.451
But that's yesterday's news.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.287
Today's headline...

09:19.325 --> 09:20.519
is "Kid 'N Play."

09:21.594 --> 09:23.221
Gentlemen...

09:23.262 --> 09:25.662
I'm willing to make
a commitment to you...

09:26.632 --> 09:28.930
if you're willing
to make a commitment to me.

09:28.968 --> 09:30.333
She's ready to commit.

09:30.369 --> 09:33.304
Wait a minute.
What do you mean by "commit"?

09:34.273 --> 09:35.467
I'm willing to commit...

09:35.508 --> 09:38.238
in financing
and producing your demo...

09:38.277 --> 09:39.744
and you...

09:39.779 --> 09:42.407
will commit
at every waking moment...

09:42.448 --> 09:46.043
in taking Kid 'N Play
to the top of the charts.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.814
Look, I can't do this.

09:47.853 --> 09:48.979
Wait a minute. What's going on?

09:49.021 --> 09:51.114
Let me talk to him, please.

09:52.358 --> 09:53.689
Kid, what do you mean you can't?

09:53.726 --> 09:55.660
I can't do this and school.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.526
You gonna kick this to the curb
for school?

09:57.563 --> 10:00.396
With the money we could make,
you could buy your own school.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.492
Look, you saw all those people
in the church.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.935
And Pops... I can't let them down.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.097
Excuse me.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.901
Maybe I could talk to your dad.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.467
- Maybe she could talk...
- Look, I don't think so.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.341
Kid, listen.

10:13.379 --> 10:14.539
Sheila, wait a minute.

10:14.580 --> 10:15.740
Fuck!

10:16.682 --> 10:18.377
Here we are.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.147
Oh, yes. Join the Mardi Gras.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.654
Come on.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.516
What's up with the soldiers?

10:28.027 --> 10:29.790
Come on, Kid, man,
this ain't your style.

10:29.829 --> 10:32.263
Oh, yes, boogie fever.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.629
That's a fraternity.

10:36.102 --> 10:39.538
Well, maybe that I can get with.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.200
What's up with her clothes, man?

10:42.241 --> 10:44.937
Look how involved everybody is.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.171
Look.

10:50.249 --> 10:52.114
Look at all this school spirit.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.584
What's up with the pigs?

11:04.196 --> 11:05.891
Yo, watch the car.

11:05.931 --> 11:08.161
Thanks for helping.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.100
Yo, just watch the car.

11:11.103 --> 11:12.661
You're just mad
about the record deal.

11:12.705 --> 11:15.333
No, I'm mad about you
fucking up the finish.

11:15.374 --> 11:17.239
You gonna get ill,
or you gonna help?

11:17.276 --> 11:19.676
You wanted to be Joe College...

11:19.712 --> 11:21.304
you be Joe College.

11:42.635 --> 11:45.798
Yo, G, hold up.
I'll be with you in a minute.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.835
Yo, what up, black?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.364
What's going on, man?
Name's Jamal.

11:50.409 --> 11:54.106
Why you buggin', man?
'Cause I'm white?

11:54.146 --> 11:56.706
Yo, you want some bean pie?

11:58.951 --> 12:01.886
Rick, we've run into
a serious problem here.

12:01.921 --> 12:04.913
We have half of a fabulous team.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.424
Unless, uh...

12:06.459 --> 12:07.926
Unless that's all we need.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.459
I can do the session.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.058
I can do it.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.399
But it was both of you
on the tape.

12:17.436 --> 12:18.733
Whoa, wait a minute now.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.831
I'm the one who came up
with the whole Kid 'N Play idea.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.341
I wrote all the lyrics.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.742
The only thing that guy ever did
was just put his name first.

12:26.779 --> 12:29.270
I don't know about this.

12:29.315 --> 12:32.842
Sheila, my take on this,
Play's on the money.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.443
Sounds like
he's the driving creative force.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.647
Then let's do it.

12:37.123 --> 12:38.522
Look, look, look.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.182
Let me see this.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.626
Isn't it cute?

12:42.661 --> 12:46.222
I know you don't think this
is what college is all about.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.893
No. It was a gift from a friend.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.663
Besides, what's wrong with it?

12:50.703 --> 12:51.829
Nothing.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.498
When I first got here,
I had a drawer...

12:53.539 --> 12:56.667
full of little boy-toy
fru-frus just like that.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.006
So, what happened?

12:58.043 --> 12:59.806
I grew up.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.836
I let my consciousness evolve.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.645
And when I left all that
male materialism behind...

13:04.683 --> 13:08.312
I began to see things in a more
politically correct light.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.450
You do like boys, don't you?

13:11.490 --> 13:12.855
I like men, girl.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.018
Thousands of them.

13:14.059 --> 13:16.755
No, I'm just kidding.
I like men...

13:16.796 --> 13:18.730
but I don't need one
to define me.

13:18.764 --> 13:20.891
And any woman who wants
to define herself...

13:20.933 --> 13:22.798
by herself and for herself...

13:22.835 --> 13:24.462
just has to free herself...

13:24.503 --> 13:27.495
of all that tired, lame,
male bullshit.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.835
Pick a color.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.634
Any color.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.912
Male bullshit.

13:41.387 --> 13:42.718
Excuse me.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.895
Bilal's in the house!

13:49.929 --> 13:52.193
Hook me up!

13:54.066 --> 13:56.466
Hi. My name is Play.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.969
I'm the manager here.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.197
I couldn't help but notice...

13:59.238 --> 14:03.038
that you seem to be looking
for something, um...

14:04.043 --> 14:06.273
Selena. I'm just browsing.

14:06.312 --> 14:09.372
Well, if there's anything
in particular you need...

14:09.415 --> 14:13.647
anything at all,
don't hesitate to come see me.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.914
I won't.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.849
That was real cute.
Now hook me up, man.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.952
Bilal, I cannot keep giving you
your own personal discount.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.293
Play, you ain't looking
at the big picture, man.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.663
I need these records, 'cause
I'm working on some scratches...

14:27.700 --> 14:29.463
for our demo session.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.471
What do you mean
"our" demo session?

14:33.505 --> 14:35.996
Let's check out
the psychology department.

14:38.944 --> 14:40.969
Ooh, this one sounds good.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.742
"Social Psychology
of Black Awareness.

14:42.781 --> 14:44.305
"Psych 222."

14:44.350 --> 14:48.480
God, it is so hard
to figure out what to do...

14:48.520 --> 14:50.420
What are you doing?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.515
I'm trying to get a closer look
at the catalog.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.788
Yeah, right. You're not even
paying attention.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.260
Am too.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.819
Look. "Psych 100.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.922
"Human Sexuality."

14:59.965 --> 15:03.662
I hope that's not the only thing
you're interested in.

15:03.702 --> 15:04.930
Of course not.

15:04.970 --> 15:08.633
I'm interested in your mind
as well as your body.

15:09.875 --> 15:13.436
Now, you need to put
a check by that, uh...

15:13.479 --> 15:15.413
humping and hauling course.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.608
That's Hubble and Hawking.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.242
Whatever. Check that one.

15:20.352 --> 15:23.549
Get off, get off, get off.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.183
Stop playing.
We have to be serious now.

15:26.225 --> 15:30.685
Damn, Play, don't you know shit
about the music business?

15:30.729 --> 15:34.756
Look, when a MC cuts a record...

15:34.800 --> 15:37.394
the DJ is the producer...

15:37.436 --> 15:39.461
because the DJ...

15:39.505 --> 15:42.099
is the one who made
your sorry ass what it is...

15:42.141 --> 15:44.268
from the motherfucking giddyap.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.868
Now hook me up, thank you.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.641
Nice sales pitch.
Twenty dollars.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.445
Twenty dollars? I thought
you was gonna hook me up.

15:51.483 --> 15:53.610
Bilal, for fifteen cuts...

15:53.652 --> 15:56.212
I should be charging your ass
a house note...

15:56.255 --> 15:57.950
and would you get
from around my counter?

15:57.990 --> 15:59.116
I'll bust that ass.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.284
I don't think so.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.452
Get these boxes out.

16:04.930 --> 16:08.889
I'm Mrs. Deevers.
I'm here for the job.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.333
How you doing, Mrs. Deevers?

16:10.369 --> 16:13.395
The job requires
a lot of heavy lifting.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.339
Oh, it's not for me.

16:15.374 --> 16:16.534
It's for my boys.

16:16.575 --> 16:17.701
Your boys?

16:17.743 --> 16:20.075
Bring your ass in here!

16:20.112 --> 16:21.579
Come on in here now!

16:21.613 --> 16:22.739
Yo, look!

16:22.781 --> 16:24.544
Right now, here.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.210
That's that punk Play.

16:26.251 --> 16:27.411
Where's Kid?

16:28.821 --> 16:32.018
These three rap stars,
they got a rap group...

16:32.057 --> 16:34.992
and if they could work
in your shop here...

16:35.027 --> 16:37.689
maybe some big-time producer
would give them a break.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.220
Oh, they got the tapes.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.198
Do that rap thing
y'all do at home.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.997
Yo, Mama,
we ain't auditioning for him.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.162
Not this punk.

16:45.204 --> 16:46.671
We ain't auditioning for him.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.569
I said do the rap!

16:49.608 --> 16:51.075
All right.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.839
Kick the rap, man.

16:52.878 --> 16:55.676
On and on, on,
and on, on, and on

16:55.714 --> 16:57.113
Like hot butter on...
Say what?

16:57.149 --> 16:58.411
Popcorn

16:58.450 --> 17:00.441
Dibby dibby die, so-socialize

17:00.486 --> 17:01.578
Clean out your ears,
open up your

17:01.620 --> 17:02.882
Eyes

17:02.921 --> 17:04.354
Now, well, maybe so

17:04.390 --> 17:05.516
I don't think so

17:05.557 --> 17:07.080
Well, funky ass

17:07.126 --> 17:08.752
Mmm

17:08.794 --> 17:10.193
What up with that?

17:10.229 --> 17:11.627
That's kind of wack.

17:11.663 --> 17:12.925
That didn't even rhyme.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.762
Yo, man, y'all be...

17:14.800 --> 17:16.392
Excuse me, Mrs. Deevers.

17:16.435 --> 17:19.097
I'm sorry, but the job
has been filled.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.502
Right, Bilal?

17:22.307 --> 17:25.070
You got twenty dollars
I can borrow?

17:25.109 --> 17:26.906
Bilal.

17:26.944 --> 17:28.810
I would appreciate it.

17:28.847 --> 17:31.372
Thank you. Sorry, guys.

17:31.417 --> 17:34.978
The job's all filled,
but loved the rap.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.614
Don't stand there
like a pile of dog shit!

17:37.656 --> 17:39.351
Move it, move it!

17:39.391 --> 17:40.756
Get on out!

17:45.764 --> 17:48.324
Yo, I saved your ass.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.733
I should charge you
the whole motherfucking store.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.464
Thanks for buying these records.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.204
Hey, yo, money, if the sister
won't cut you no play...

18:00.245 --> 18:02.543
you got to assert yourself.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.276
What do you know about sisters?

18:04.316 --> 18:06.443
I know I like a fat booty.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.578
And just 'cause the sister
be sweatin' you...

18:08.620 --> 18:11.111
about getting positive on
the politically correct tip...

18:11.156 --> 18:14.250
don't mean that she kickin'
the nasty to the curb.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.227
- Jamal, do me a favor.
- What?

18:16.261 --> 18:17.728
Talk white.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.261
Will you be paying
your registration fees...

18:22.301 --> 18:24.269
with cash, check,
or credit card?

18:24.303 --> 18:25.429
What?

18:25.471 --> 18:26.597
Cash, check, or credit card?

18:26.638 --> 18:27.764
What?

18:27.806 --> 18:30.036
Will you be paying with cash,
check, or credit card?

18:33.879 --> 18:35.039
My check!

18:51.763 --> 18:52.923
ForPlay.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.996
What is this?

18:59.505 --> 19:01.473
He signed it.
It's like cash.

19:01.507 --> 19:03.737
Always losing shit.
If his dick wasn't screwed on...

19:03.775 --> 19:06.266
he'd leave that shit, too.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.644
Of course
I don't socialize with them.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.080
Hey, wait.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.013
Tell Father I played
four sets of tennis...

19:16.054 --> 19:17.214
with Professor Vernault.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.851
Give me that phone,
you selfish punk.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.193
No, it's my phone.
You can't have it.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.968
My father gave that to me.
I'll report you.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.004
Selena, right?

19:40.045 --> 19:43.879
Play, am I really
gonna sing backup on your demo?

19:43.916 --> 19:46.248
You can have
any damn thing you want.

19:47.586 --> 19:48.848
Excuse me.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.058
Who is it?

19:54.092 --> 19:56.583
Oh, Kid, chill out, man.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.220
Don't worry about it.

19:58.263 --> 20:02.063
Your scholarship money
is as good as in the bank.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.728
It's in there. Bye.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.844
Hey, yo, Sidney, Zora.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.779
Hey, Kid. Hey, Jamal.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.145
Hey, what's up?

20:17.182 --> 20:19.548
Um, I'm over here.

20:19.585 --> 20:24.147
Taking Afro-American Studies:
Consciousness of the Sixties.

20:24.189 --> 20:26.020
Just imagine, you and I...

20:26.058 --> 20:28.549
exploring the roots
of blackness together.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.687
Kid, I'm not taking it.

20:30.729 --> 20:34.256
I couldn't fit it
into my schedule this semester.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.927
Kind of at the last minute...

20:36.969 --> 20:41.531
I decided that I really,
really wanted to take...

20:43.141 --> 20:45.507
Male Mythology:
A Feminist Perspective.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.512
Right. Anyway...

20:47.546 --> 20:50.606
I hope you enjoy
Consciousness of the Sixties.

20:50.649 --> 20:52.674
Zora says
the professor's really great.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.652
Very good. You'll like him.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.711
Damn.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.280
"Zora says the professor's
really great."

20:59.324 --> 21:00.552
Zora says take this course.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.025
Zora says
take three steps forward.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.028
Zora says take three steps back.

21:04.062 --> 21:06.622
Just because Zora says it,
doesn't mean she have to do it.

21:06.665 --> 21:08.326
Hey, you got played, yo.

21:10.135 --> 21:13.036
The perfect job for my boys.

21:13.071 --> 21:14.299
Stop pushing me!

21:14.339 --> 21:16.671
Get your butts
into that employment office.

21:16.708 --> 21:20.007
Get in there! I don't care
what your sorry ass...

21:20.045 --> 21:21.342
Malcolm X.

21:22.681 --> 21:25.411
Everybody knows
what Malcolm was about, right?

21:25.450 --> 21:26.712
Right.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.647
He must have been important.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.851
'Cause you can go into any
shopping mall in the country...

21:33.892 --> 21:37.487
and buy a T-shirt
with his picture on it...

21:37.529 --> 21:40.623
right next
to the Ninja Turtles T-shirts.

21:42.467 --> 21:45.436
But what do we really know
about Malcolm?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.495
We know he was a Muslim...

21:47.539 --> 21:49.871
who made a pilgrimage
to Mecca...

21:50.709 --> 21:54.873
and returned to America
a changed man...

21:55.547 --> 21:57.811
with a changed philosophy.

21:59.084 --> 22:03.817
Now, if you were printing
that philosophy on a T-shirt...

22:04.489 --> 22:05.979
what would it say?

22:07.326 --> 22:08.816
Mr. Robinson.

22:19.938 --> 22:23.101
Malcolm X's philosophy?

22:23.141 --> 22:25.371
On a T-shirt?

22:25.410 --> 22:28.868
I'm happy you asked me
that question.

22:30.615 --> 22:33.175
I'll be even happier
when you answer it.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.254
OK, see, uh...

22:37.289 --> 22:40.486
Malcolm X was pro-black...

22:40.525 --> 22:42.015
very pro-black.

22:42.627 --> 22:44.959
And in his pro-blackness...

22:44.996 --> 22:48.124
he believed
that the white man...

22:48.700 --> 22:50.565
in his pro-whiteness...

22:50.602 --> 22:53.503
was not very pro-black.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.937
Yo, man, stop bullshittin'.

22:57.743 --> 22:59.335
Class...

22:59.378 --> 23:02.438
I think Mr. Robinson
wants to know...

23:02.481 --> 23:03.778
if you can say...

23:04.649 --> 23:07.675
white-devils.

23:09.121 --> 23:12.557
Why don't we hear
from one of these white-devils?

23:12.591 --> 23:14.422
Maybe the one
sitting next to you...

23:14.459 --> 23:17.622
and I know I'm scared of you,
Mr...

23:18.830 --> 23:21.560
Johnson. Jamal Johnson.

23:25.470 --> 23:29.463
Are you familiar
with what Malcolm X believed...

23:29.508 --> 23:30.975
when he returned from Mecca?

23:33.879 --> 23:37.576
Malcolm embraced
the brotherhood of all men.

23:37.616 --> 23:39.208
Yo, word to the mother.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.845
Congratulations, Mr. Johnson.

23:41.887 --> 23:43.354
Unlike Mr. Robinson...

23:43.388 --> 23:46.721
you obviously did
your preclass reading.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.791
I won't see you
in summer school.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.566
Sheila, what's wrong? Get away.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.625
Baby, what's wrong?

23:58.937 --> 24:00.495
He cleaned me out.

24:00.539 --> 24:01.597
Who?

24:01.640 --> 24:02.766
Who, baby?

24:02.808 --> 24:04.605
Rick, that's who.

24:04.643 --> 24:06.270
But what? What happened?

24:06.311 --> 24:09.212
He took everything
he could get his hands on...

24:09.247 --> 24:11.511
for gambling debts.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.383
I don't know why
I ever trusted him.

24:14.419 --> 24:15.545
But, listen, forget about him.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.111
Are you going to be OK?

24:17.155 --> 24:19.555
Baby, are you going to be OK?
Talk to me, woman.

24:19.591 --> 24:23.220
Play, I'm so sorry.
I can't do the session.

24:23.261 --> 24:24.489
I don't have the money...

24:24.529 --> 24:27.430
and the worst part is,
MCA is waiting for the record.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.627
Without it, we're nowhere, Play.

24:29.668 --> 24:32.193
Dang. Look, if I get my hand
on the motherfucker...

24:32.237 --> 24:33.363
I'll pop a cap in his ass.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.531
Baby, talk to me.

24:34.573 --> 24:35.733
What do you need?
Where does he live?

24:35.774 --> 24:37.207
I'm your man. Talk to me.

24:37.242 --> 24:39.403
Bilal, would you please
shut the fuck up?

24:41.413 --> 24:44.974
Listen, if I had the cash,
I'd front the session myself.

24:45.016 --> 24:47.382
Is there anywhere
you can get the money from?

24:47.419 --> 24:50.252
All we need is to raise
the deposit for the studio...

24:50.288 --> 24:51.915
and we can still
do the session...

24:51.957 --> 24:53.948
and my accountant
is getting me liquid again.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.482
But I'm completely busted.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.791
If you hadn't put all your money
in that pussy mobile...

24:57.829 --> 24:59.296
we wouldn't be in this shit.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.958
Play, you don't understand.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.762
This is our future at stake.

25:04.703 --> 25:08.901
I have a check,
but it's made out to Kid.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.306
He did sign it,
so I guess it's as good as cash.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.776
- I'll take it.
- Wait.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.938
That's perfect.
I won't even cash it.

25:14.980 --> 25:16.572
Wait, wait.

25:16.615 --> 25:18.014
Aw, damn.

25:18.049 --> 25:19.573
Kid's check?

25:19.618 --> 25:21.108
Yo, Play, that's fucked!

25:21.152 --> 25:23.677
The boy needs a education.

25:23.722 --> 25:27.283
Yo, Play, that's fucked.

25:27.325 --> 25:28.792
Hey, man, you need to get
with the program.

25:28.827 --> 25:31.625
Buy the books,
do the reading... End of problem.

25:32.697 --> 25:33.823
You turkey.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.355
Hey, take it easy!

25:35.400 --> 25:36.958
Hey, guys, I smell something.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.936
Do you smell something?

25:38.970 --> 25:40.301
I smell pussy!

25:40.338 --> 25:41.566
Yo, hold up.

25:41.606 --> 25:43.301
This is black men using
their power of authority...

25:43.341 --> 25:44.569
against another brother.

25:44.609 --> 25:46.076
Yo, black, this ain't correct.

25:46.111 --> 25:47.703
What's up with that?

25:47.746 --> 25:49.680
Yo, who is this man,
your girlfriend?

25:49.714 --> 25:51.477
Yo, what you want, man?

25:51.516 --> 25:52.915
Wait a minute.

25:52.951 --> 25:54.441
What are you guys doing here?

25:54.486 --> 25:56.181
What are we doing here?

25:56.221 --> 25:57.347
What up with that?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.084
Motherfucker's in college,
and he can't read.

25:59.124 --> 26:02.252
This means any time we want to,
we can fuck you right up.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.091
Yo, and right now,
I definitely feel it.

26:04.129 --> 26:06.120
Hey, Zilla, you feel it, man?

26:06.164 --> 26:08.257
I feel it right now, man.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.995
You really feel it?

26:10.035 --> 26:11.468
What does he mean?

26:11.503 --> 26:13.130
Tell these two motherfuckers
what time it is.

26:13.171 --> 26:15.162
It's time to kick
their fucking ass!

26:15.206 --> 26:17.071
Yeah! Come here!

26:17.108 --> 26:18.336
Motherfucker.

26:23.214 --> 26:25.307
A hundred
and twenty-three dollars?

26:25.350 --> 26:26.476
For books?

26:26.918 --> 26:27.714
Tell me about it.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.117
I'm spending so much on books...

26:29.154 --> 26:31.748
I won't be able to afford
a trip home until spring.

26:31.790 --> 26:34.156
So, where's home... Japan?

26:34.192 --> 26:36.524
No. Texas.

26:37.162 --> 26:38.652
Where's yours, Africa?

26:42.233 --> 26:43.393
Stupid, huh?

26:44.569 --> 26:45.968
No big thing.

26:46.004 --> 26:48.029
Bad check. Bad check.

26:50.976 --> 26:52.705
It declined your check.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.336
You're going to have to go
to the finance office...

26:54.379 --> 26:56.472
to straighten it out.

26:56.514 --> 27:00.006
Don't worry.
It happens all the time.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.631
Can I help you?

27:20.672 --> 27:22.867
Time waits for no man!

27:27.412 --> 27:30.643
They told me down the hall
I'd have to see Dean Kramer.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.918
Don't let him sweat you,
my brother.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.146
Maintain.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.325
So...

27:43.361 --> 27:44.555
Christopher...

27:45.964 --> 27:47.829
before I get started,
I want you to know...

27:47.866 --> 27:49.128
this isn't a racial thing.

27:50.268 --> 27:52.498
What isn't a racial thing, sir?

27:52.537 --> 27:54.505
The fact that your
tuition check bounced.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.134
My tuition check bounced?

27:58.176 --> 27:59.575
Now, this isn't a black thing.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.841
It's a deadbeat thing.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.111
I have to take your student I.D.

28:12.657 --> 28:14.648
Deadbeat! Deadbeat! Deadbeat!
Deadbeat! Deadbeat!

28:19.297 --> 28:20.457
Deadbeat!

28:24.069 --> 28:26.594
If you don't pay your tuition
by the end of the week...

28:26.638 --> 28:28.162
I'm going to have
to kick you out of here.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.106
Stand up, please.

28:35.513 --> 28:39.347
Good-bye, Christopher.
Have a nice day.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.045
Don't forget...

28:41.086 --> 28:44.146
Time waits for no man!

28:44.189 --> 28:45.520
Peace.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.991
Where is my money?

28:48.026 --> 28:50.893
Kid, you got to promise me
you're not going to ill.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.490
Come on, Kid.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.023
I'm not going to ill.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.899
Sheila has your money.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.461
What?

29:00.505 --> 29:01.972
I'll tell you what he said.

29:02.006 --> 29:03.303
Sheila got your money, man.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.708
Kid, you promised you wasn't
going to ill on me, man.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.048
Look, see?
I told him not to do it.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.746
I said, "Kid needs his money.

29:15.787 --> 29:18.255
"The boy needs an education."
But no.

29:18.289 --> 29:20.723
I said, yo, when you find out,
you going to whup that ass...

29:20.759 --> 29:23.193
and that's what you gonna do...
Whup that ass.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.059
Bilal, shut the fuck up.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.825
Whatever.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.594
Let me ask you this:

29:28.633 --> 29:30.828
Why does Sheila have my money?

29:30.869 --> 29:32.962
I'm glad you asked that, Kid.

29:33.004 --> 29:35.131
Um, see, your money's safe.

29:35.173 --> 29:38.108
Um, Rick...
You remember Rick, right?

29:38.143 --> 29:39.508
Yeah, well, he was a snake.

29:39.544 --> 29:41.739
He stuck her up for the money,
and she couldn't do my record.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.748
- Your record?
- Yeah.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.340
Kid, he dissed you, man.

29:45.383 --> 29:46.975
Look, whup his ass!

29:47.018 --> 29:50.283
Listen, the only ass that's
going to get whupped is yours!

29:50.321 --> 29:51.447
I don't think so.

29:51.489 --> 29:52.615
Oh, you...

29:52.657 --> 29:55.057
Um, listen, you wanted
to be Joe College, right?

29:55.093 --> 29:56.754
And I just needed the check...

29:56.795 --> 30:00.356
as a deposit down
on the session so that, um...

30:00.398 --> 30:04.164
by the time her accountant
liquidates all her assets...

30:04.202 --> 30:06.227
That's right,
liquidates all her assets...

30:06.271 --> 30:09.399
that we would get the money
back tomorrow at the session...

30:09.440 --> 30:11.738
and it'll make sense to you
once you know the business.

30:11.776 --> 30:13.141
Let me make it make sense!

30:13.178 --> 30:15.203
Your money is gone, man!

30:15.246 --> 30:17.544
He fucked you
and didn't even kiss you!

30:24.322 --> 30:26.950
See? Studio, ride.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.288
Ride, studio.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.657
Yo, no!

30:29.694 --> 30:32.219
Yo, I'm telling you, man,
ain't no studio in there.

30:32.263 --> 30:33.924
No, yo, that shit is gutted out.

30:33.965 --> 30:36.456
I'm telling you,
it's a fucking front, man.

30:37.535 --> 30:40.561
Do Me Records.
What can I do for you?

30:40.605 --> 30:43.540
Sounds like you could do a lot,
but anyway, my name is Play.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.543
Uh, yo, and this is the...

30:45.577 --> 30:47.636
his producer.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.614
Um, Sheila Landreaux,
she's expecting me.

30:50.648 --> 30:52.445
Sheila who?

30:52.483 --> 30:53.711
See, I knew it.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.616
Oh, this... Get off me.

30:55.653 --> 30:57.621
- Shut up.
- What?

30:57.655 --> 30:58.781
I'm sorry. Not you.

30:58.823 --> 31:00.688
But listen, Sheila Landreaux...

31:00.725 --> 31:03.694
and my name is Play,
and I'm here to cut a record.

31:03.728 --> 31:05.559
Sorry. Never heard
of Landreaux or Play...

31:05.597 --> 31:08.395
so there's no way Do Me
is doing shit for you today.

31:08.433 --> 31:11.197
Yo, she fucked you, man...
Yo, with your money, Kid.

31:11.236 --> 31:13.602
Didn't I tell you when I tried
to tell you that in there?

31:13.638 --> 31:15.629
Yo, let's just go.
I was trying to tell him.

31:17.008 --> 31:19.670
So, Play, when are we going
to record our record?

31:19.711 --> 31:21.679
Your record?
I'm here to cut my record.

31:21.713 --> 31:22.907
What the fuck
are y'all talking about?

31:22.947 --> 31:24.778
Who the fuck
you talking to like that?

31:24.816 --> 31:26.283
Yo, chill, chill.

31:26.317 --> 31:29.184
Yo, man, fuck your record...
Our record.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.188
Sheila Landreaux
gave you our money...

31:31.222 --> 31:33.213
for our recording session
to make our record.

31:33.258 --> 31:35.021
You know what I'm saying?

31:35.059 --> 31:36.720
Y'all know Sheila?

31:36.761 --> 31:37.989
Wait a minute.

31:38.029 --> 31:40.520
She said he has your money
for your recording session?

31:40.565 --> 31:42.032
You damn right.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.931
Well, excuse me. Damn.

31:43.968 --> 31:47.369
You know, it sounds
like she fucked all of youse.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.895
What the...

31:48.940 --> 31:51.101
Shit, they're taking her car!

31:53.711 --> 31:54.905
Halt! Assume the position!

31:56.514 --> 31:59.312
Looks like we nailed the
purloined Porsche perpetrators.

31:59.350 --> 32:00.476
And they're all black.

32:00.518 --> 32:02.008
What a surprise!

32:02.854 --> 32:04.014
Hands up!

32:06.257 --> 32:09.249
I want you victims of crime
to remember in the future...

32:09.294 --> 32:11.728
not to give money
to any beautiful woman...

32:11.763 --> 32:14.231
by the name
of Sheila Landreaux...

32:14.265 --> 32:16.665
a.k.a. Shareese Taylor...

32:16.701 --> 32:18.896
a.k.a. Sharnelle Butler...

32:18.937 --> 32:21.929
a.k. a...
Well, I think you got the idea.

32:23.508 --> 32:24.998
You...

32:25.043 --> 32:27.568
you and you,
this is your lucky day.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.170
Beat it! Get out of here.

32:29.213 --> 32:30.407
You hurting me, man.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.881
Oh, shit.

32:31.916 --> 32:35.750
OK, you three guys
are going for a ride downtown.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.913
What the fuck for?

32:36.955 --> 32:38.081
What up with this?

32:38.122 --> 32:39.248
Hands down!

32:39.290 --> 32:40.848
Car theft, larceny...

32:40.892 --> 32:42.359
mail fraud, embezzlement...

32:42.393 --> 32:43.519
Damn!

32:43.561 --> 32:45.529
I'm going to tell you like this.

32:45.563 --> 32:46.791
I hope you ain't getting
no pussy...

32:46.831 --> 32:48.924
'cause that shit
could be lethal, man.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.892
Bilal, would you just
do me a favor and shut up?

32:51.936 --> 32:53.631
Would you just shut the fuck up?

32:53.671 --> 32:56.970
Yo, Play, the bitch has
a record longer than my dick.

32:57.008 --> 32:58.635
Yo, can I ask you something?

32:58.676 --> 33:00.041
Can I ask you something, please?

33:00.611 --> 33:01.669
What?

33:01.713 --> 33:04.580
You feel real stupid,
don't you, huh?

33:04.615 --> 33:05.980
When are you gonna learn?

33:06.617 --> 33:08.642
And look at this motherfucker.

33:08.686 --> 33:09.983
Ass out...

33:10.021 --> 33:11.921
No money, no education.

33:11.956 --> 33:13.480
This shit got to stop. I'm...

33:15.727 --> 33:16.887
How long?

33:17.962 --> 33:19.293
Well, at least
I'm not the irresponsible one...

33:19.330 --> 33:21.764
who left his check around
that I'd be tempted by it.

33:21.799 --> 33:22.925
You know what I'm saying?

33:22.967 --> 33:24.867
You...

33:27.705 --> 33:28.831
Chill!

33:28.873 --> 33:30.135
Yo, I was...

33:30.174 --> 33:32.506
Yo, I was bullshit...
Yo, we boys.

33:32.543 --> 33:34.033
We boys!

33:36.014 --> 33:37.140
Shit.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.910
Damn.

33:38.950 --> 33:40.679
Yo, you know what I think?

33:40.718 --> 33:42.515
Shut the fuck up, Bilal.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.353
Yo, it ain't going
to be too many more...

33:45.390 --> 33:48.291
of them shut-the-fuck-ups.
all right?

33:48.326 --> 33:50.487
Because I'll whup
both of your asses.

33:50.528 --> 33:53.554
You should talk
to the bank, man.

33:53.598 --> 33:54.826
What are you talking about?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.493
Your girl Sidney...

33:56.534 --> 33:59.002
Her parents, they own minimalls.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.028
I'm not asking Sidney for money.

34:01.172 --> 34:04.539
Sidney, there's something
I got to talk to you about.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.109
See... This is really difficult...

34:08.146 --> 34:10.614
We been seeing each other
for over a year, and...

34:10.648 --> 34:12.342
Well...

34:12.382 --> 34:14.010
See, well...

34:14.052 --> 34:15.212
You want to see other people?

34:17.487 --> 34:19.319
Yo, I'm really fine about it.

34:19.357 --> 34:20.483
But, wait, I didn't mean...

34:20.525 --> 34:21.786
I'm fine about it.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.260
I'm fine about it, too.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.956
It's so funny.

34:25.996 --> 34:29.023
We live closer to each other now
than we did at home...

34:29.067 --> 34:33.299
and somehow,
we see less of each other.

34:33.337 --> 34:35.100
Well, you know...

34:35.139 --> 34:38.040
you have your classes,
and I have mine.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.476
You're making new friends,
and I guess I am, too.

34:41.512 --> 34:44.481
We're at college
to have new experiences, right?

34:44.514 --> 34:45.982
Why should
we tie each other down?

34:48.286 --> 34:50.583
I don't want to tie you down if
you don't want to be tied down.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.145
Good...

34:54.025 --> 34:55.788
'Cause I feel
the same way about you, too.

34:57.895 --> 35:00.864
It's great that we feel
the same way about each other.

35:07.238 --> 35:09.468
I guess I'll see you
around the campus...

35:09.874 --> 35:11.034
buddy.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.970
Yeah.
See you around campus, pal.

35:40.238 --> 35:41.705
Sit down. I need to talk to you.

35:48.045 --> 35:50.411
Listen, get your act together.

35:50.448 --> 35:53.645
Keep your mind on them books
and off them gangs.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.088
Hey, what up, man?

36:05.129 --> 36:06.721
Damn, what's wrong with you?

36:06.764 --> 36:08.459
Damn, man, you look like shit.

36:09.133 --> 36:10.930
How could the best day
of my life...

36:10.968 --> 36:14.062
and the worst day of my life
happen in the same week?

36:14.105 --> 36:16.073
Yo, I ain't got the science
on that, black...

36:16.107 --> 36:17.768
but what I do know is...

36:17.808 --> 36:21.300
you better deal with Dean Kramer
and your financial situation...

36:21.345 --> 36:23.939
before that situation
deals with you.

36:23.981 --> 36:25.448
Better get off your behind.

36:25.483 --> 36:28.247
Yo, I gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna check you later.

36:28.286 --> 36:29.480
Peace.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.318
Ah, brother Robinson.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.486
I think I can help you out.

36:38.696 --> 36:39.856
Come here.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.422
Come on, brother.

36:46.671 --> 36:48.070
Bottom line...

36:48.105 --> 36:49.572
You don't have the snaps...

36:49.607 --> 36:51.871
but you want Dean Kramer
to give you an extension...

36:51.909 --> 36:54.036
till you figure out
what your next move is.

36:54.078 --> 36:55.204
That's right.

36:55.246 --> 36:56.873
Naw, see, that's fucked.

36:56.914 --> 36:58.211
If you was a white boy...

36:58.249 --> 36:59.409
he'd give you more extensions
than a bad weave...

36:59.450 --> 37:01.179
but, a brother,
he ain't going to play that.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.312
So, in other words, I'm over.

37:03.354 --> 37:04.844
See, not necessarily.

37:06.157 --> 37:09.183
See, my boy works
the main computer.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.821
Now, cuz could lose
your paperwork for a while...

37:11.862 --> 37:13.193
and buy you a little time.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.357
For a price?

37:14.398 --> 37:15.797
Hey, yo...

37:15.833 --> 37:17.300
life's a bitch, homey...

37:17.335 --> 37:19.997
and not always a fine bitch,
either.

37:20.037 --> 37:22.164
Hello, Miles.

37:22.206 --> 37:24.538
Well, hello yourself,
Professor Vernault.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.703
Allow me to introduce you
to young Christopher Robinson...

37:27.745 --> 37:29.337
a most promising freshman.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.813
Professor Vernault...

37:30.848 --> 37:33.316
is one of our most esteemed
scholars, Christopher.

37:33.351 --> 37:34.818
Professor...

37:34.852 --> 37:37.252
you know, I still find myself...

37:37.288 --> 37:38.812
reflecting
upon our discussions...

37:38.856 --> 37:40.824
of Chaucerian scatology.

37:40.858 --> 37:42.758
Then you'll love
my upcoming lecture...

37:42.793 --> 37:45.819
on the juxtaposition
of Thanatos and Eros...

37:45.863 --> 37:47.023
in the works of Fielding.

37:47.064 --> 37:49.396
Oh, wouldn't miss it, sir.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.401
Well, I must be off, Miles.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.870
Wow. That was deep.

38:00.911 --> 38:04.005
Yo, you want
to whup the white man...

38:04.048 --> 38:06.676
you got to know how to play
the white man's game.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.708
- Hook me up.
- Wise decision.

38:10.254 --> 38:12.984
Now, my boy usually charges
the football squad...

38:13.024 --> 38:14.184
a couple hundred a head.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.386
I don't have that kind of money.

38:16.427 --> 38:18.395
Well, what you got, brother?

38:18.429 --> 38:21.364
Come on, brother,
don't let this pass you by.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.292
That's all the money
I have in the world.

38:23.334 --> 38:24.460
I'll take it.

38:24.502 --> 38:25.969
What is...

38:26.003 --> 38:28.403
the single most
important question...

38:28.439 --> 38:30.703
any of us can ask ourselves?

38:32.076 --> 38:33.737
Who...

38:33.778 --> 38:35.405
am I?

38:35.446 --> 38:37.505
Late again.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.177
My girl left me.

38:42.286 --> 38:45.255
We've been taught that it's OK
to define ourselves...

38:45.289 --> 38:47.985
in relationship
with others as...

38:48.025 --> 38:49.151
What you doing, man?

38:49.193 --> 38:50.785
...slave...

38:50.828 --> 38:51.954
nanny...

38:51.996 --> 38:53.759
athlete, or entertainer...

38:55.099 --> 38:59.365
but never on our own terms
as individuals.

39:00.871 --> 39:04.807
Ralph Ellison brilliantly
explored that theme...

39:04.842 --> 39:07.174
in "The Invisible Man..."

39:07.211 --> 39:08.735
which I can see...

39:08.779 --> 39:11.771
that Mr. Robinson...

39:11.816 --> 39:15.411
is most anxious
to discuss with us.

39:15.453 --> 39:16.579
Come on, man, don't...

39:16.620 --> 39:18.087
Mr. Robinson!

39:18.122 --> 39:19.248
I am?

39:19.290 --> 39:20.951
I am.

39:24.228 --> 39:26.389
"The Invisible Man"...

39:26.430 --> 39:28.523
A great book. A very great book.

39:28.566 --> 39:29.897
Here we go again.

39:29.934 --> 39:31.868
But I always wondered...

39:31.902 --> 39:33.494
why did he call...

39:33.537 --> 39:35.562
the invisible man...

39:35.606 --> 39:37.130
the invisible man?

39:37.174 --> 39:40.405
Everyone is on the edge
of their seats.

39:40.444 --> 39:41.604
Why?

39:45.282 --> 39:47.614
I think the author
was trying to say...

39:47.651 --> 39:49.846
that black people...

39:49.887 --> 39:52.583
are like that movie...

39:52.623 --> 39:55.251
where the only way
you could see the guy...

39:55.292 --> 39:56.919
is if he was...

39:56.961 --> 39:58.428
wrapped in white bandages.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.729
So Ellison...

40:06.737 --> 40:08.329
was saying that...

40:09.340 --> 40:14.141
in order for white society
to see us...

40:14.178 --> 40:15.839
we must be wrapped in white?

40:16.947 --> 40:18.107
Yeah.

40:19.483 --> 40:20.848
I am.

40:20.885 --> 40:23.080
Very insightful, Mr. Robinson.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.248
You taught me something.

40:27.491 --> 40:29.288
Could I see you after class?

40:29.326 --> 40:30.486
You're through.

40:33.664 --> 40:35.359
You wanted to see me, sir?

40:36.033 --> 40:37.660
What I want to know is...

40:38.669 --> 40:41.194
do you have the gift
that I think you have...

40:41.906 --> 40:45.706
or am I just being charmed
by your line of bullshit?

40:50.648 --> 40:52.548
Could I get back to you on that?

40:53.451 --> 40:56.887
Yes, you can, in a week...

40:56.921 --> 40:58.821
with a twenty-page paper...

40:58.856 --> 41:01.222
in which you discuss
how Ellison, Wright, Baldwin...

41:01.258 --> 41:03.852
and the other authors
I assigned to you to read...

41:03.894 --> 41:08.331
handle the theme of growing up
as a black male in America...

41:10.267 --> 41:12.394
In a week? Wait a minute.
That's not fair.

41:12.436 --> 41:16.236
Life is not fair, Mr. Robinson.

41:16.273 --> 41:17.740
There are students
on this campus who are here...

41:17.775 --> 41:20.175
only because their parents
are rich alumni.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.940
That isn't fair.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.344
And those students
might look at you...

41:23.380 --> 41:25.109
and think that the only reason
you're here...

41:25.149 --> 41:28.744
is because you're black,
and you got a good jump shot...

41:28.786 --> 41:31.550
or you're black, so you can run
with a football...

41:31.589 --> 41:33.489
or you're just here
because you're black.

41:33.524 --> 41:35.515
That isn't fair.

41:36.026 --> 41:38.221
And it might not be fair
that you got to prove...

41:38.262 --> 41:41.288
that you're here because
you've earned it, but you do...

41:41.332 --> 41:44.199
and if you don't prove it to me,
Mr. Robinson...

41:45.035 --> 41:47.230
I'll fail your ass.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.608
Yo, you talk to Kid?

41:56.647 --> 41:57.807
He hasn't even called me...

41:57.848 --> 41:59.941
to find out how I'm feeling
after losing my record deal.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.418
Play, it was wrong, man.

42:04.622 --> 42:05.782
Fifteen dollars.

42:07.725 --> 42:09.693
- We hook up later, right?
- All right, peace, man.

42:09.727 --> 42:11.786
- Peace.
- Yo, peace out.

42:11.829 --> 42:12.989
Later.

42:15.833 --> 42:17.733
What's up with the extra ends?

42:19.436 --> 42:21.427
Sometimes you got to pay
what you owe, right?

42:21.472 --> 42:22.632
Later.

42:24.408 --> 42:25.898
You're right.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.314
A twenty-page paper to write.

42:35.352 --> 42:38.014
All those authors.
It ain't gonna be easy.

42:38.689 --> 42:40.816
You can't get in
without a student I.D.

42:40.858 --> 42:41.984
What up with that?

42:42.026 --> 42:44.517
Give it up, man.
Yo, here's some food.

42:46.196 --> 42:47.629
Damn. What, you starving?

42:49.767 --> 42:50.893
Thanks, Jamal.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.835
No problem, man.

42:52.870 --> 42:54.565
You know, without my I. D...

42:54.605 --> 42:57.904
I can't get into the library
or the cafeteria.

42:57.942 --> 43:00.706
Living by my wits isn't easy.
It's hard work.

43:00.744 --> 43:03.474
Hard work? I haven't seen you
do any work yet.

43:04.148 --> 43:05.775
You need to get off your butt...

43:05.816 --> 43:07.716
and go down
to the faculty dining hall.

43:09.153 --> 43:12.486
Word. Yo, free food,
the pay is correct...

43:12.523 --> 43:14.753
but, yo, man, you better
make sure you come correct...

43:14.792 --> 43:17.693
'cause to work for Mr. Lee...
You got to be all you can be.

43:17.728 --> 43:20.060
Move it, move it, move it!

43:20.097 --> 43:21.962
Loaded tray.

43:21.999 --> 43:23.159
Do you know where Mr. Lee is?

43:29.506 --> 43:30.666
Excuse me. Do you...

43:31.342 --> 43:32.832
Out of the way, please.

43:34.511 --> 43:35.671
Excuse me.

43:36.380 --> 43:38.007
Move your ass.

43:38.782 --> 43:40.682
Do you know where... Hey.

43:46.156 --> 43:47.316
Look out. That's my foot.

43:51.895 --> 43:53.419
Heads up.

43:55.966 --> 43:58.400
All right,
so what's the holdup here?

43:58.435 --> 44:00.733
You should've been out of here
fifteen minutes ago.

44:00.771 --> 44:02.602
Do you know where Mr. Lee is?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.301
Who wants to know?

44:06.110 --> 44:07.338
You must be the new recruit.

44:08.545 --> 44:10.775
You got to go to work, boy.

44:10.814 --> 44:13.305
There's a pile of spuds
over there with your name on it.

44:14.351 --> 44:16.251
Do a good job, boy,
and you'll be on your way...

44:16.286 --> 44:19.915
to earning your kitchen
assistant first-class pin.

44:20.991 --> 44:22.151
Yes, sir.

44:26.563 --> 44:28.190
You forgot your cap.

44:28.232 --> 44:29.824
Everybody got to wear the hat.

44:30.901 --> 44:32.892
But it won't fit.
I'd look stupid.

44:32.936 --> 44:34.699
Are you saying I look stupid?

44:34.738 --> 44:36.205
No, no, sir.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.366
Actually,
it looks kind of good on you.

44:37.408 --> 44:38.875
Are you saying I look good...

44:38.909 --> 44:40.809
with a damn plastic cap
on my head?

44:40.844 --> 44:41.970
No, sir.

44:42.012 --> 44:43.570
Then what are you saying, boy?

44:43.614 --> 44:46.481
I have no idea.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.711
Listen, son...

44:47.751 --> 44:50.777
you want to stay
off my shit list...

44:50.821 --> 44:52.448
put on the hat.

45:02.933 --> 45:04.491
You look good.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.395
If I lose this,
my dad will kill me.

45:08.439 --> 45:09.963
Do you feel lucky?

45:11.975 --> 45:13.533
I'm going for it, man.

45:13.577 --> 45:15.602
Let's go, let's go, man.

45:15.646 --> 45:18.706
Put your weight on it.

45:18.749 --> 45:20.114
Gimme it, man!

45:21.118 --> 45:23.586
Give me my money, man.

45:23.620 --> 45:24.746
Give me... Thank you!

45:24.788 --> 45:27.552
Fuck, man!
Thank you, man, thank you!

45:27.591 --> 45:30.116
Freak, man, freak!
I'm a winner, man!

45:30.160 --> 45:31.991
- Who's next?
- Me!

45:33.530 --> 45:35.725
Scared money
don't make no money.

45:35.766 --> 45:36.994
What's up, K-l-D?

45:38.001 --> 45:39.468
Yo, Kid!

45:39.503 --> 45:41.698
Jamal, watch the cash.

45:41.739 --> 45:45.038
Kid, wait! Yo, man, whassup?

45:45.075 --> 45:46.599
What are you trying to do to me?

45:46.643 --> 45:48.372
Trying to raise you some dough.

45:48.412 --> 45:51.506
By ripping off these people
I have to see every day?

45:51.548 --> 45:53.846
OK, we'll kick Monte Carlo
night to the curb.

45:53.884 --> 45:56.079
I'm forty-five minutes away,
and on my days off from work...

45:56.120 --> 45:58.350
I can come up
and work on a new plan.

45:58.388 --> 45:59.616
- Plan?
- Yeah.

45:59.656 --> 46:01.624
Don't mention plan
in my presence.

46:01.658 --> 46:03.592
I can't afford
any more of your plans.

46:18.142 --> 46:20.770
You're gonna get your "A,"
mm-hmm.

46:20.811 --> 46:22.779
You're gonna get your "A."

46:22.813 --> 46:24.508
Girl, you're gonna get your "A,"
you hear me?

46:24.548 --> 46:26.573
Oh! Oh, Play!

46:27.618 --> 46:30.519
Uh, Kid.
Yo, man, I'm thinkin' hard.

46:55.712 --> 46:58.476
"If you have
no confidence in self...

46:58.515 --> 47:01.040
"you are twice-defeated
in the race of life.

47:01.084 --> 47:04.645
"With confidence, you have won
even before you have started.

47:04.688 --> 47:06.121
"Marcus Garvey."

47:36.186 --> 47:37.915
Professor Sinclair?

47:40.924 --> 47:43.358
What can I do for you,
Mr. Robinson?

47:48.232 --> 47:50.792
My paper, sir.

47:50.834 --> 47:53.234
Excuse the coffee stains.

47:53.270 --> 47:56.433
I just wanted you to know
I worked really hard on it.

47:56.473 --> 47:58.134
I quoted from your book...

47:58.175 --> 48:00.609
which I must say
was really excellent.

48:04.715 --> 48:07.548
I'll reserve judgment
on your paper, Mr. Robinson...

48:07.584 --> 48:10.018
but...

48:10.053 --> 48:12.783
as far as your
ass-kissing goes...

48:13.891 --> 48:15.449
two thumbs up.

48:19.696 --> 48:21.789
Why don't you roll the dice?

48:21.832 --> 48:23.459
In your ass!

48:25.602 --> 48:26.933
Chill, my brother.

48:26.970 --> 48:28.494
I ain't your brother.

48:28.538 --> 48:29.971
Ain't trying to cause no beef.

48:30.007 --> 48:31.269
What are you doing?

48:31.308 --> 48:34.800
Come on, why you go and do
something stupid like that?

48:34.845 --> 48:37.143
Yo, milk,
do something about your boy.

48:38.248 --> 48:39.943
That's it.

48:39.983 --> 48:43.077
If your name isn't Kid or Jamal,
get out of my room!

48:43.120 --> 48:45.281
Without even hearing my plan?

48:45.322 --> 48:48.689
You managed to spare a little
time to come up with a plan?

48:48.725 --> 48:51.455
Not any plan.
The plan of plans, you know?

48:51.495 --> 48:54.020
Yo, think about it.
A house party.

48:55.098 --> 48:56.224
A house party?

48:56.266 --> 48:58.166
Yo, not just any house party.

48:58.201 --> 48:59.862
The mother of house parties.

48:59.903 --> 49:01.598
A pajama jammy jam.

49:02.439 --> 49:04.532
Women in negligees...

49:04.574 --> 49:06.132
Look at this. Mmm.

49:06.176 --> 49:08.144
...get in free.

49:08.178 --> 49:10.646
Brothers have got to pay.

49:10.681 --> 49:12.148
All of the proceeds go...

49:12.182 --> 49:14.150
to the Christopher Robinson
scholarship fund.

49:14.184 --> 49:15.310
You, boy.

49:15.352 --> 49:16.785
Don't worry about nothin'...

49:16.820 --> 49:18.981
'cause I'm about
to take care of everything.

49:19.022 --> 49:20.546
Yo, Kid.

49:20.590 --> 49:22.888
I'm taking care of everything.

49:22.926 --> 49:24.553
Let me get this straight.

49:24.594 --> 49:26.255
You want a bunch
of college women...

49:26.296 --> 49:28.423
to strip to their underwear,
come to my room...

49:28.465 --> 49:30.160
so you can charge a bunch
of horny motherfuckers...

49:30.200 --> 49:31.428
to be in there with them?

49:32.469 --> 49:34.903
Ladies, six feet.

49:34.938 --> 49:36.667
Wait a minute. Slow down, man.

49:36.707 --> 49:39.870
Not here.
In the faculty dining hall, man.

49:39.910 --> 49:41.434
All you gotta do is...

49:41.478 --> 49:42.968
get the key?

49:44.147 --> 49:46.342
Oh, no. Look, I'm not with it.

49:46.383 --> 49:47.816
Forget about it, all right?

49:48.819 --> 49:50.480
I'm not with it.

49:51.989 --> 49:54.184
Why's he flippin' on us?

50:07.571 --> 50:09.471
Kid, Kid, Kid.

50:09.506 --> 50:10.734
Boy, what you want?

50:10.774 --> 50:14.175
I borrowed this book
from Sidney.

50:14.211 --> 50:15.906
You can give it back to her.

50:15.946 --> 50:18.141
Now, you know
that's not Sidney's book.

50:18.181 --> 50:19.341
It's not?

50:23.854 --> 50:25.845
You're right. It's not.
My mistake.

50:25.889 --> 50:27.754
Yeah, that is your mistake.

50:27.791 --> 50:30.851
Coming around here with that
lame "Do me, baby" mentality...

50:30.894 --> 50:33.089
is another definite mistake.

50:33.130 --> 50:34.791
I'll tell you
what the mistake is.

50:34.831 --> 50:37.391
The mistake is you think
you know everything.

50:37.434 --> 50:40.699
You don't know me. You don't
know anything about me.

50:40.737 --> 50:44.002
Tell Sidney I asked about her,
and I hope she's doing OK.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.201
Please?

50:48.979 --> 50:50.207
What?

50:50.247 --> 50:53.307
Look, there's a rally
this afternoon.

50:53.350 --> 50:55.875
It's against the cutbacks
in the ethnic studies program.

50:58.355 --> 51:02.291
So if a man were looking for
Sidney, he might find her there.

51:04.594 --> 51:06.323
Knowledge is power!

51:07.464 --> 51:09.329
- What?
- Knowledge is power!

51:10.267 --> 51:11.734
Come on, sister.

51:18.775 --> 51:21.243
Now, if we allow
the administration...

51:21.278 --> 51:24.543
to cut back on ethnic studies...

51:24.581 --> 51:27.414
we will be letting them deny
the contributions...

51:27.451 --> 51:30.511
of all of our cultures
that made this country great.

51:31.521 --> 51:33.045
Knowledge is power!

51:37.194 --> 51:39.128
Come on, y'all.
Clap with me now.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.023
Listen here.

51:44.034 --> 51:45.592
Everybody wants to be a rebel

51:45.635 --> 51:47.432
Well, a rebel without a cause
can turn into a devil

51:47.471 --> 51:49.063
For a moment just take a pause

51:49.106 --> 51:50.334
So we can reach a lever

51:50.373 --> 51:52.170
To open up the doors,
eliminate the gap

51:52.209 --> 51:54.177
You're searching for
perfection in somebody else

51:54.211 --> 51:56.679
You sacrifice yourself
for his illegal wealth

51:56.713 --> 51:58.806
Living in the image
of a man what you are

51:58.849 --> 52:00.646
You're just another Jackie
who wants to be a star

52:00.684 --> 52:03.152
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm getting quite annoyed

52:03.186 --> 52:05.313
There was a brain
that had nothin', just a void

52:05.355 --> 52:07.516
Filled with
materialistic thoughts

52:07.557 --> 52:09.787
Of cars and dolls,
things you just bought

52:09.826 --> 52:11.953
Drugs people sold,
but I'm gonna rise like a tower

52:11.995 --> 52:14.293
Tellin' all the people
that it's time to devour

52:14.331 --> 52:16.595
you see, the future
that we live in is ours

52:16.633 --> 52:19.193
Because knowledge,
it is power

52:19.236 --> 52:20.999
Knowledge is power

52:22.506 --> 52:25.236
Check it out, intelligence
captivates my mind

52:25.275 --> 52:27.675
I'm gonna succeed with
my brain and not my behind

52:27.711 --> 52:29.770
'Cause I don't feel
that as a black woman

52:29.813 --> 52:32.805
I should give up the booty
if the boss thinks it's boomin'

52:32.849 --> 52:34.874
Or some people
who move up on others

52:34.918 --> 52:36.579
Like they own 'em
and they don't treat 'em equal

52:36.620 --> 52:39.282
Can't you see?
This is racist, racist, racist

52:39.322 --> 52:40.482
Where they chase us

52:40.524 --> 52:43.322
Away from knowing who we are
and where we came from

52:43.360 --> 52:45.453
I ain't stopping
until we gots this game on

52:45.495 --> 52:49.192
'Cause I know this is the hour
to make knowledge equal power

52:49.232 --> 52:50.893
Scream it, scream it

52:50.934 --> 52:52.094
Knowledge

52:52.702 --> 52:53.862
Is power

52:56.873 --> 52:58.204
Thank you.

53:00.110 --> 53:02.670
Right now I would like
to introduce our next speaker.

53:02.712 --> 53:04.873
Professor Sinclair.

53:08.485 --> 53:09.782
Thank you, Zora.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.915
As I stand here
and look at your...

53:12.956 --> 53:15.754
Zora, your performance
was moving.

53:15.792 --> 53:17.259
We need more people like you.

53:17.294 --> 53:18.727
I want you to call me.

53:18.762 --> 53:20.855
I think we can make you a star.

53:20.897 --> 53:24.958
You have the right to learn
about your heritage...

53:25.001 --> 53:26.992
and the heritage of others.

53:27.537 --> 53:30.938
Support ethnic studies.

53:30.974 --> 53:33.033
Knowledge is power!

53:34.144 --> 53:35.771
What's wrong, Sidney?

53:35.812 --> 53:38.975
Uh, nothing really.

53:39.015 --> 53:41.381
It's Kid, isn't it?

53:41.418 --> 53:43.249
I know he was at the rally.

53:43.286 --> 53:44.446
You know him?

53:44.487 --> 53:46.512
I met him at the dean's office.

53:47.324 --> 53:49.019
He was having some problems.

53:49.826 --> 53:51.259
Doesn't look too good.

53:51.928 --> 53:53.327
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:53.363 --> 53:54.853
That's too bad.

53:55.799 --> 53:57.994
He was going on
about his ex-girlfriend...

53:58.034 --> 53:59.763
and how they were breaking up...

53:59.803 --> 54:02.328
because she wasn't into
"givin' up the rhythm..."

54:02.372 --> 54:03.532
as he put it.

54:04.874 --> 54:08.366
But the more he said about her,
the more I knew...

54:08.411 --> 54:10.572
he didn't know what he had...

54:10.614 --> 54:12.741
and I had to meet her...

54:12.782 --> 54:15.148
because she sounded
like such a find.

54:17.754 --> 54:19.483
Damn, Miles!

54:19.522 --> 54:21.990
Give the child
some room to breathe.

54:22.025 --> 54:23.458
Zora...

54:23.493 --> 54:25.085
what a surprise.

54:26.763 --> 54:28.458
I should be going.

54:28.498 --> 54:29.658
Can I giv...

54:31.534 --> 54:32.694
Can l...

54:34.904 --> 54:36.098
Can I give you a call later?

54:37.741 --> 54:39.368
Yeah, please.

54:43.613 --> 54:45.581
All right.

54:49.386 --> 54:52.082
Oh, God. What do you think?

54:52.122 --> 54:53.987
He's so different from Kid.

54:54.024 --> 54:56.584
He's... he's mature,
he's sophisticated...

54:56.626 --> 54:58.253
he's an intelligent
conversationalist.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.559
Yeah. I see you two
were about to get into...

55:00.597 --> 55:02.326
a heavy conversation in French.

55:02.365 --> 55:06.699
Look, Sidney, different doesn't
necessarily mean better.

55:06.736 --> 55:09.330
Why don't you think about that?

55:31.161 --> 55:33.629
Dean Kramer's office called...

55:33.663 --> 55:36.461
and they want to see you
right away.

55:38.735 --> 55:43.832
This is a work study job...

55:43.873 --> 55:46.034
for students...

55:46.076 --> 55:51.173
and they say
you ain't no student!

56:14.738 --> 56:18.299
I thought you were supposed to
be hooking me up for the black.

56:18.341 --> 56:20.935
Yo, brother Robinson,
I'm working on it...

56:20.977 --> 56:25.346
but delicate situations such
as these sometimes take time.

56:27.517 --> 56:29.041
Dean Kramer, I was just...

56:29.085 --> 56:31.019
Leaving?

56:31.054 --> 56:32.453
Thank you, Miles.

56:36.526 --> 56:38.187
The deadline I gave you...

56:38.228 --> 56:40.992
for paying your tuition
has come and gone.

56:41.030 --> 56:43.362
And we do have a policy
of encouraging our students...

56:43.400 --> 56:46.836
be they black or white,
to pay their tuition.

56:47.737 --> 56:51.537
So, it's with great sadness
that I have to tell you...

56:51.574 --> 56:55.032
Dean Kramer, please,
just give me one more week.

56:55.078 --> 56:56.340
I promise I'll have the money.

57:00.550 --> 57:01.642
One more week.

57:03.386 --> 57:06.583
But if you don't have
the money by then...

57:06.623 --> 57:08.887
it really will be it!

57:09.893 --> 57:12.487
Time waits for no man!

57:14.130 --> 57:16.462
Why haven't you called me
about the recording session?

57:16.499 --> 57:19.024
You promised me
I could sing backup.

57:19.068 --> 57:21.332
Listen, Selena, don't sweat me!

57:22.772 --> 57:25.605
Don't sweat it. As soon as the...

57:25.642 --> 57:26.939
Excuse me.

57:26.976 --> 57:29.774
If the others don't succeed,
I got the twelve-inch you need.

57:29.813 --> 57:31.542
Clarence's Records. What up?

57:32.549 --> 57:34.449
When's the party?

57:34.484 --> 57:36.645
Tell him about the pajama party!

57:59.776 --> 58:02.677
I knew about this party,
and I don't even go to school!

58:02.712 --> 58:04.577
I want y'all to tell me
about this party.

58:04.614 --> 58:06.878
Everybody know about this party
but the three of you.

58:06.916 --> 58:08.440
Go out there
and find out about this party.

58:08.485 --> 58:10.112
Make your grandma proud!

58:35.378 --> 58:37.869
We can get you signed
in a heartbeat.

58:37.914 --> 58:39.779
- Really?
- No problem.

58:39.816 --> 58:40.942
What are you doing tonight?

58:40.984 --> 58:43.282
- There's a pajama party.
- We'll be there.

58:48.558 --> 58:50.321
I think it's a pajama party.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.885
And the rules
are very clear on that shit.

58:52.929 --> 58:54.988
"No university building
or other property...

58:55.031 --> 58:56.328
"may be used
as a meeting place...

58:56.366 --> 58:57.628
"or venue for entertainment...

58:57.667 --> 58:59.100
"without the express
authorization...

58:59.135 --> 59:00.329
"of the dean of the college."

59:00.370 --> 59:02.099
Very good, Stab.

59:02.138 --> 59:05.733
Now all we need to know is where
the party's gonna be at.

59:19.656 --> 59:21.681
All right, who was it?

59:25.795 --> 59:27.695
I don't think so.

59:27.730 --> 59:29.493
Check that out, man.

59:36.239 --> 59:38.901
Yo, for a midget white boy,
you all right, Jamal...

59:38.942 --> 59:40.842
sneakin' in the house
with the brothers.

59:40.877 --> 59:42.845
Yeah, you all right,
even though you try to flex.

59:42.879 --> 59:44.141
Can't play dice, though.

59:44.180 --> 59:45.374
Will you be quiet?

59:46.382 --> 59:47.610
Damn, Kid, calm down.

59:47.650 --> 59:50.813
You're getting white as a ghost,
and that's hard for you to do.

59:50.853 --> 59:51.979
Now, come on.

59:52.021 --> 59:53.181
All right, all right.

59:58.328 --> 59:59.818
Come on, come on, come on.

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:09.701
I just want to remind everybody.
Let's be careful in there, OK?

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.138
Would you relax?

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:16.508
Careful!

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:18.741
Y'all want to help me
with my equipment, please?

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:19.941
Thank you.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.616
Yo, I swear if I gotta carry
this shit in by myself...

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:26.019
I'll play the Village People
all fuckin' night.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:28.381
Yo, man, chill.
Don't go out like that.

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:38.559
Who are you supposed to be,
Mrs. Kunta Kinte?

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.664
I thought this outfit
was politically correct.

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:43.831
You know, P.C.

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:47.775
Well, it is P.C. if it stands
for "poor choice."

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.278
Girl, why are you looking
like me instead of you?

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:53.948
I don't know what I'm supposed
to look like anymore.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.508
I don't know what I'm supposed
to feel like anymore.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.448
I miss Kid,
but he needs to grow up.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.752
That's what you said, right?

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:04.692
Now, don't go blaming
breaking up with Kid on me.

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:06.160
You're the one
always talking about...

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:08.925
how immature he is
with his "Do me" attitude.

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:12.560
But it's not about what I think.
It's about what you think.

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.536
What's in your head
and your heart.

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:17.698
That's what being a strong woman
is all about, Sidney.

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:21.642
This is Zora going to the party.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.441
I hope I see Sidney there.

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:30.112
All the girls
kept talking about...

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:32.951
was silk teddies
and sexy nightgowns.

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:34.882
All clear! Let's go!

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:38.189
- All right!
- Let's see some panties, boy!

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:42.624
Girl, hurry your fat ass up!

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.632
Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:57.541
I'm never, never, ever
gonna let you go

01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.648
Brothers are ten each...

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:02.344
women appropriately dressed...

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.784
or should I say undressed...

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:04.980
get in free.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:11.121
She crept into my heart

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.355
At a funky time

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.626
I met her once or twice

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:18.133
I knew something was right

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:20.101
I was hoping Sidney
would be here.

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.797
Have you ever known Sidney
to miss a good party, man?

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.135
She's gonna be here, man.

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:25.504
If you see her,
just let me know, OK?

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:28.032
I will, but go in there
and try and hit some skins.

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:30.443
Pretty black hair
and big brown eyes

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.142
Made my mouth so dry

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:34.308
Should you be with her

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.681
Excuse me.

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:37.777
I don't know

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.946
Pardon me.

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:41.218
I tried to tell

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.225
Yo, B, you got some cuties here.

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:46.322
I'm doing the best I can

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.091
What, what your papa said

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:50.895
Boy, do things your way

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.924
Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:54.732
Yo, baby, yo

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.739
Never, ever,
ever gonna let you go

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:59.606
I never, ever want to let you go

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:01.576
Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:03.606
Hi, Patty!

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:05.238
I'd love to,
but I had to let one go

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.374
I had to let one go

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:12.317
Love can make you blind

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:14.118
I almost lost my mind

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.216
I just know what I had to do

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:19.888
Sidney, you know if any woman
gets in here for free, it's you.

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.055
Yo, you ain't gotta...

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.621
Yes, I do.

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.030
We both do.

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:25.226
You seen Kid?

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:29.367
Last time I saw him,
he was lookin' for you.

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:31.032
- Really?
- You got an eye problem?

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:33.007
- Come on!
- Fool.

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:34.873
Live all my days

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.572
If one could

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.603
She had all the right things

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.946
Then she touched
the right places

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:42.951
Now I'm in her world

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:45.886
And I'm so confused

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.253
No place for me

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.884
- Yo, yo, Play, man.
- What? What's up?

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.689
I think something's wrong
with the toilet, man.

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:55.721
Déjà vu like a motherfucker.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:04:00.392
Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:02.563
Yo, baby, yo

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:05.301
Never, never, ever
gonna let you go

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.741
I can't believe it.
I'll be able to stay in school.

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.307
Sidney, you look incredible.

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.811
Actually,
I was hoping you'd be here.

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:18.051
It's like I told you before...

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:19.520
if you ain't givin' up
the rhythm...

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:20.715
the boy ain't interested.

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:26.156
Let's dance.

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:29.992
Ain't nobody here!

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.632
Damn! Damn! Damn!

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:37.665
Yo, man.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.408
What?

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:44.913
Do you hear any music?

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:47.006
No. What up with that?

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.880
Yo, and there ain't
nobody here dancin'.

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:51.478
Aw, shit!
And I wanna shake my ass!

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.554
I don't know what you come to do

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.661
I come to clap my hands

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:02.027
I come to stomp my feet

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:03.190
You want to dance, Sidney?

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:04.358
No, I don't want to dance.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.630
- Come on.
- I don't want to dance.

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:08.159
- Come on.
- No.

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:11.833
Throw my feelings
out on the shelf

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:13.734
Baby

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:15.266
Come on.

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:17.006
All right. All right.

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:20.645
Don't make me laugh.

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.245
Baby

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.880
So let's gather
'round the peoples

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:29.255
Let's have a funky party tonight

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:34.887
But I've been down all day today

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.297
Let's have a house party

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.198
I don't know
what you're gonna do

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.702
And I don't know
what you come to do

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.606
I come to dance my steps

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:50.111
I come to clap my hands

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:53.676
Come on, girl, let's do this.

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:56.276
And the bass is really pumpin'

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:59.811
The groove
is funkin' hard as hell

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.519
Baby

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.753
And there's gotta be a honey

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:08.230
At the party gonna treat me well

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:09.856
Let's do this.

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.025
That's all I gotta say

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:13.661
But there's no one like my baby

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:16.900
My baby knows just who she is

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.732
Yeah, she knows,
she knows, she knows

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:22.437
But no matter what the problem

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:25.572
My cookie's gonna fix it,
you dig?

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:31.614
See, 'cause I been down
too long today

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.145
Let's have a house party

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.350
Come on. Go, boys.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:40.185
So everybody bring
your dancin' shoes

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:42.561
Let's have a house party

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:44.566
I don't know what you come to do

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.204
I come to clap my hands

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.472
I come to stomp my feet

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.103
I come to dance my steps

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:58.807
I come to shout for peace

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:01.946
I don't know what you come to do

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.424
I come to clap my hands

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.825
I come to do my steps

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.523
I come to jump up and down

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:16.326
Check it, check, check

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:17.957
Gimme some of that cookie

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.127
Mmm, gimme
some of that good thing

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:25.166
That's what I said

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:38.249
You heard the man,
give him some of that good thing

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.358
Damn, ain't nobody here!

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.957
Aw, shit!

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:54.128
- Come on, Pee-Wee!
- Damn!

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:56.968
Shit.
I just busted my ass.

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:58.704
Hey, ladies!

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:01.301
Lookie here,
it's ladies' choice...

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:02.537
and we're going to slow it up...

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:06.275
for all the beautiful
young ladies.

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.247
It's ladies' choice, Sidney.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.915
Excuse me. I was here first.

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:15.651
Step off, brother.

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:17.522
Let Sidney make the choice.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.925
Wait a minute. She's my girl.

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:22.260
Wait. I don't remember saying
I was anybody's girl.

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:24.858
And you seem to have already
made your choice.

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:26.828
What?

01:08:26.868 --> 01:08:28.063
Ta-ta.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.868
Mmm, you can look...

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.636
but you better not touch.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:12.607
Zora, I want you to meet
my producer Miriam Mobuto.

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:15.640
This is Zora Henderson,
a wonderful young talent.

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:18.084
Oh, I could put my beer
on that booty!

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.984
Could live in that ass!

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:21.319
I gotta pass on that.

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:23.881
You see, my brothers,
what you hold in your hands...

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:27.225
is one of the many chains that
enslave the black man today.

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:28.423
Think about it.

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:32.798
Damn, vanilla
about to strike oil.

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.426
There he goes, look at that!

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:41.171
Yo, that's some jungle booty,
and I'm Tarzan.

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.310
Yo, I know
where everybody's at, man!

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:45.506
They in the library.

01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:54.952
Oh, damn! Chill!

01:09:57.159 --> 01:09:58.717
- We got enough yet?
- Uh-uh.

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.922
What you mean, "Uh-uh"?
All that? Come on.

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:03.056
- We ain't there yet.
- Aw, man.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.460
Yo, come up here!
Rack some shots, boys.

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:10.904
Y'all look good down there.
I'm proud of you.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.135
Jamal, I didn't call "Jamal."
Excuse me, man.

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:15.871
- Let me see the mic, man.
- Jamal, chill, all right?

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.435
Bilal, think about it, man.

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:19.504
He likes big booties, dice.

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.516
He likes bean pie.
Sure, put him on.

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.074
You probably got a big dick,
too, huh?

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:25.552
A big tremendous white dick.

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:28.723
Great show, Kid.

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:30.852
Here I go

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.654
I talk trips and zips
as I flip an enemy bird

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:37.097
Suckers can't fake
the flavor candy like Nerds

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.726
'Cause I made the track
react with a vengeance

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:41.861
Scooping up more pigeons
and suckers with a vengeance

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.338
Wild hip-hop, slip-shot,
I grab for my pistol

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:46.705
'Cause I act strapped,
and this is what I call it

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:49.142
'Cause when I got the mic,
I excites life, that's right

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:51.169
In it with a pimp limp
sent to get hipper

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:52.339
You're provoked, choked

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:53.746
Now you're stumped
and stay lumped

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:54.976
The J-A-S man

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:58.350
I totally like dancin'
with the K-l-D and the P-L-A-Y

01:10:58.387 --> 01:10:59.615
And better believe
I sell tracks then

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:02.123
I'm proud to be black,
and Y.B.T., we be maxin'

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:05.490
The dopest action with the DJ,
the boogedy boogedy bing bang

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:08.325
I slip shit, flip shit
with the hip-hop street slang

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:10.628
I gots, 'cause I rock
the big groups, is that not?

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:13.692
I hits the boots, 'cause
the hookers love the dreadlocks

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:29.683
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:31.379
We just dancin', y'all

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.581
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:35.920
Out there on the floor

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.654
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:40.218
We just dancin', baby

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:43.561
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:47.296
Gonna give you more

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:50.828
Yeah

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:53.307
Yo, Kid, check this out.
I'm about to reach out my soul.

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:56.600
If you're lookin' for more,
step on the dance floor

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.772
Check your coat
and your troubles at the door

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:01.374
'Cause for sure,
you're gonna see a smile today

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:03.385
The problems of the world
seem miles away

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.148
The only thing that matters
is a good time

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:07.451
That can be had
with the help of a good rhyme

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.753
The DJ's hype,
more than up to par

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:11.487
Uh-oh,
there goes a cutie at the bar

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:14.087
- So I
- Strolled on over to say hi

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:15.756
- I don't want any.
- Come on, just a little taste.

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:16.924
It's a party.

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:18.523
Dance a while

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:20.159
I'll do anything
to see you smile

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:22.693
You see,
my job is to take you higher

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:25.366
After a couple of songs,
I'll require

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.840
Having fun? Well, I ain't done

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:28.172
The best is yet to come

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:31.043
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.672
We just dancin', y'all

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:35.115
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.811
Out there on the floor

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:39.650
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.519
We're just dancin', baby

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.388
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.594
Gonna give you more

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.858
Baby,
let's get some refreshments.

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:50.057
OK.

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:07.143
What's the matter with you?
Come on, kick it.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.977
The music's hype,
and if it's all right with you

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:13.044
I wouldn't mind spending
the rest of the night with you

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:14.988
No kidding, baby,
we can make some noise

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:16.854
You and your girls
and me and my boys

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:19.554
Just feelin' right,
a night full of pleasure

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:22.063
We can take it slow
with no pressure

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:23.758
- Enough respect
- You won't regret

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:26.632
This'll be a night
you won't soon forget

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:28.226
And that's a promise
from me to you

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.500
Take my hand, girl,
I'm gonna see you through

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.598
You don't strike me
as a woman who fronts

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.233
- Here's your chance
- You only live once

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:37.074
I wanna hear you say,
oh, what a blast, Kid

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:39.080
We sure had good fun
while it lasted

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:40.843
- Hung out with friends
- And hit the skins

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:43.579
Next week,
we're gonna do it again

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:48.619
She's mine, fool!

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.190
Nobody, ain't nobody

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:57.062
Gonna hurt you

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.566
Yo, Miles,
where you goin' with my girl?

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:09.202
- Let go, or I will fuck you up!
- Yo, who you talkin'...

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:13.107
Get off me, Miles!
Get off me!

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:14.342
Stop! You're hurting me!

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:17.984
Kid, help... Help me!

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.318
It was very nice meeting you.
I'm sure we could...

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:22.346
Those are the motherfuckers
who stole Kid's money!

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:25.485
- Oh, shit.
- What the hell is going on here?

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:26.687
Get out of my way!

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.224
Hey, hold up!

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:37.928
- Rick, she's right behind us.
- Hey, somebody stop her!

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:42.741
- Get out of the way.
- Now you're gonna get it!

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:44.405
Let her go,
or I'm gonna fly that head.

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.073
She ain't nothin'. Take her.

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.175
Hold her.

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:51.451
Hey, get the fuck out my way.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.886
Yo, what you looking at, boy?
Campus security.

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:00.952
Nobody make a goddamn move.
This is an illegal party.

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:03.521
Yo, what kind of fuckin' lyric
was that?

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:05.055
Turn your damn badge around.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.159
Oh, what up with that?
I'm sorry. It's upside-down.

01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:09.602
Everybody stop this shit!

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:11.765
Get out of my way!

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.469
This motherfucker's
trying to get away.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.704
Come on, man.

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.905
Get the fuck out the way!

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:20.938
Go on, grab her! She stole
Kid's scholarship check!

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:22.575
Hold her!

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:23.778
Let me go!

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:26.986
I ain't tryin' to let you go.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:28.546
Zora, knock her out!

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.031
Jungle fever, baby.

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:38.191
- Jungle!
- Fever!

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:40.394
- Jungle!
- Fever! Fever!

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:45.298
Punk!

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.898
Watch it, Pops!

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:49.708
Damn, man.

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:51.406
- Excuse me, man.
- And a colored, too.

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:52.743
Oh, shit!

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:53.907
I'm gonna kill you!

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.109
Come here.

01:15:57.986 --> 01:15:59.544
Get out of my way!

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:04.053
There he is right now!
Give it to him!

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:08.989
"D."

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:11.799
Get him, Mo!

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:13.357
Oh, shit!

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:18.271
Freeze that ass!

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:29.912
Oh, shit!

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.585
See ya, mophead.

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:39.357
Away!

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.123
Goddamn!

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:43.188
That must be
the fifteenth time...

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.391
We lost the pussy!

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:51.998
Whose pussy is this?
Give me that good college pussy.

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:57.809
Get up, punk! Get up!

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:03.548
Wait! Get that mother!

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.480
Get him!

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:14.088
Yeah, right there.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.465
Freak show!

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:20.991
What? Pull out a dick?

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:24.096
What the fuck is going on?
Where's my gun?

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.677
He's got a gun!

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:36.513
- Hurry up!
- You crazy motherfuckers!

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:38.143
I'm tryin' to fuck!

01:17:41.256 --> 01:17:42.848
You ain't shit.

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.358
I'm through messin' around
with you.

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:47.157
Oh, you gonna squab
like a man now, boy?

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:57.029
This one's for the black!

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.938
Is that all you got? Come on!

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:14.715
See ya.

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:18.089
And I sure wouldn't wanna be ya.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.631
Would you pull me up?

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.768
- Stay still!
- Get me out of here.

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:35.208
I'll never listen to another of
your harebrained schemes again!

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:36.801
You in no position to talk shit.

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.608
Just... just get me up.

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.478
Just calm down, buddy.
I got ya.

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:28.624
What is going on here?

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:32.132
Hey, get...

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.361
Get off me!
What up with that?

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:36.768
Yo, man, yo,
we just doing our goddamn job.

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.568
We got an 8-19,
breaking and entering.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.700
The description
matches you three clowns.

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:43.336
Now, wait a minute.
I am a very patient man...

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:46.541
but I want somebody to tell me,
what is going on here?

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:49.675
I'll tell you what's going on.
She stole my boy's money.

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:52.050
Oh, so that's where
your tuition money went.

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.645
- Got it.
- That's right.

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:56.020
And he stole his money, too...

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:57.217
and hurt his girl.

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:02.158
Listen,
it'll all make more sense...

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:04.131
if, you know,
you knew the business.

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.532
- It's close enough.
- And Sheila Landreaux...

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:07.694
Sheila Landreaux?

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:10.432
- A.k.a. Shareese Taylor?
- A.k.a. Sharnelle Butler?

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:12.736
- That ho again?
- Well done, gentlemen.

01:20:12.774 --> 01:20:14.935
Let these men go.

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.774
And I am very concerned that
your treatment of my officers...

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.713
indicates
a deep-seated hostility...

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.807
toward black men
in positions of authority.

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:23.477
But, sir, I'm a black man.

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:24.746
Then act like one.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:27.418
These men
have performed duties...

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:29.548
above and beyond
the call of duty...

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.684
and they will be
rewarded for it.

01:20:31.726 --> 01:20:34.752
Rewarded? Hey, fellas,
that means we get our stripes.

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:37.993
Young man, you have a bright
future at this university.

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:39.830
Miles,
your future is behind you.

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:41.062
You're out of here. Take him!

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:43.002
But, Dean Kramer,
it's a complete fabrication.

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:46.098
It's a miscarriage of justice.
I ain't goin' out like that.

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:47.574
Get 'em out of here.

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:50.271
As for the rest of you,
fair warning...

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:53.338
Time waits for no man.

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:56.714
You have fifty-nine minutes
and thirty-two seconds...

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:59.151
to put this building
back in its original shape...

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:00.779
or you face expulsion.

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:02.289
Have you got that?

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:03.518
Peace.

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:05.287
Will you look at this place?

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:09.087
And I thought
they fucked my place up.

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:11.291
- What am I gonna tell Mr. Lee?
- It's OK, man.

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.563
I don't know,
but it better be real good.

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:15.462
I'm out.

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:16.663
That's your ass!

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:19.799
Mr. Lee...

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:21.308
Mr. Lee, my ass.

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:24.073
I got three telephone calls,
including Dean Kramer...

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:26.706
asking if I gave authorization
to use this hall.

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:29.649
Now, now, uh, Mr. Lee, right?

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.414
Check this out,
I know it looks bad...

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:34.547
but it was for a good cause,
my brother.

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:38.116
See, we had to borrow the place
to raise money for my man.

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:42.118
Play, thanks, but no excuses.

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:43.824
Give me the money.

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:45.856
What, the ends for school?
Are you crazy?

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.301
Play, no excuses.

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.496
Give me the money.

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:53.700
I have to do this by myself.

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:57.872
Oh, and you expect me to stand
around and watch this, right?

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.346
l... I can't do it.

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:07.246
Illegal party,
half-naked women...

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:09.553
What kind of way is that
to handle a money problem?

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.115
How come you didn't come
to talk to me?

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:14.725
I'm sorry I disappointed you,
Mr. Lee.

01:22:15.897 --> 01:22:19.333
Hey, I don't want your money.
I want to kick your ass.

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:22.695
I know, but take this.

01:22:22.737 --> 01:22:24.967
And if it's not enough to cover
all the damages...

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:26.871
I'll do whatever it takes
for as long as it takes...

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.068
to make things right.

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:51.459
Sorry, Pop.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.267
It's all right, Kid.

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:02.510
No, man. Hello, Play, what's up?

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:05.740
What are you doing here?

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:10.083
I had a feeling
you'd be up here...

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:12.018
so I figured I'd come up here
and give you a lift back.

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:13.213
Thanks...

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:16.056
but if you don't mind,
I'd rather be alone.

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:24.026
Got a couple of cuties
waiting in the car, man.

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:26.033
Remember the ones
in the pink negligee...

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:24.721
You know,
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:27.851
Come on, now.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:30.524
You know I'm gonna be up here
every weekend looking after you.

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:50.041
Kid, I'm your boy.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:52.076
You know I'm gonna take care
of your girl while you're gone.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.985
Don't worry about it.

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:57.617
You just keep those nasty-ass
dreads off my woman, all right?

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.854
Yo, guys, I got to get
this stuff downstairs.

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.420
Play's already an hour late.

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:06.866
That means I got another
15 minutes before he gets here.

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:08.926
That Kid
be on some serious C.P.T.

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:10.437
Wait. Hold up.

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:13.106
There's some people
I got to see before I go.

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:26.014
How you doin', son?

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:27.749
Not so good.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.484
Things didn't work out, so...

01:25:29.524 --> 01:25:31.082
I'm gonna be leavin' school.

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.359
Just remember what I told you.

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:36.420
Sometimes you got to do
what you don't want to do...

01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:38.022
in order to get
where you want to be.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.067
Remember,
if you ever need anything...

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:43.263
I'm here for you.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.135
Thanks a lot, Mr. Lee.

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:48.335
I'll be back.

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.304
I'll save a plastic cap
for you...

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:54.542
with your name on it.

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:04.989
Professor Sinclair?

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:06.186
Sir?

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:08.661
I was wondering
if you had a minute.

01:26:11.065 --> 01:26:12.657
Missed you in class today.

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:15.433
I missed being in it.

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:20.964
I guess that's something
I have to get used to.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:23.542
I have to drop out of school.

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:26.707
Money problems.

01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:30.183
You quitting, Mr. Robinson?

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:33.710
Well, I guess I just haven't
proved I belong here...

01:26:33.755 --> 01:26:35.017
at least not now.

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:37.647
I thought that the student
who wrote this paper...

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:39.887
did prove that he belonged here.

01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:42.961
"A-"?

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:44.692
I had to take off
for the coffee stain.

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:47.593
Chris...

01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:50.604
you are a talented writer...

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:53.163
and you have earned a place
in this school.

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:55.369
I have?

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:59.045
If I got you a job
as my student assistant...

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.377
could you get by?

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:06.146
It just wouldn't cover
all my expenses.

01:27:06.187 --> 01:27:08.052
But, hey, it's no big deal.

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:10.887
I'll get a job, save my money.

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:12.085
I'll be back.

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:20.130
A lot of brothers and sisters
say that...

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:22.662
and never come back.

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.408
Make sure that you do.

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:12.613
Check out our new car.
We got our stripes!

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:16.552
I'll be right back.

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:20.394
- Y'all don't be long now.
- OK, baby.

01:28:21.195 --> 01:28:22.355
All right.

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:28.760
- What's up?
- Where's ForPlay?

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:31.832
Yo, man, it's my fault
you had to drop out of school...

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.773
and we can't have that.

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:35.833
Here. I'm sorry, man.

01:28:38.212 --> 01:28:39.406
You said the "S" word.

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:43.208
What do you want,
a fucking bullhorn or something?

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:49.720
I can't believe it.

01:28:49.757 --> 01:28:51.588
You sold ForPlay?

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:56.593
Sometimes you got to pay
what you owe, man.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:01.897
l... I can't believe it, man.
I don't know what to say.

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:04.666
Yo, man, just let your grades
do your talking, man.

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:06.298
That's all I want.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:09.640
Play, we're going to be late
for our centerfold shoot.

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.345
I'm the photographer.

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:17.512
Hurry up!

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:19.247
Wait a minute.
You're gonna need an assistant.

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:21.653
Let me put my things away,
and I'll get right with you, OK?

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:23.213
Whoa, wait a minute, man, no.

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:25.384
What I need you to do
is go upstairs...

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:26.620
study your ass off...

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:28.458
'cause I'm coming back
periodically...

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:29.963
and I'm gonna check
the professors...

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:31.157
and make sure
you're doing good, man.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.258
Don't let me down.
You're an investment now.

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.826
I'm out of here,
five thousand on this thing.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.531
Come on, girls, let's go.
Come on, Bilal.

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:42.970
Bilal, did I mention to you
the guy who bought ForPlay...

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:45.137
has a brother
who's in the record business?

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:54.047
Thanks, Pops.

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:58.986
Hey, what's up? You stayin'?

01:29:59.026 --> 01:30:00.152
Yo, I got the dough, man.

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:01.388
- Word?
- Yeah!

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:02.953
You in there, money!

01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:06.661
"Know from whence you came."

01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:09.268
"If you know whence you came..."

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:13.930
"there is really no limit
to where you can go."

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:16.374
James Baldwin.

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:49.236
Not "F"!

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:52.139
"F-"!

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:57.775
Atten-hut!

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.247
About face!

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:04.818
Papa say...

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:08.392
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:09.794
Slide!

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:13.867
We are proud because
you have taken the high road...

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:15.664
and not the low road.

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.736
Unlike some
of our other youngsters...

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:19.740
who shall remain nameless.

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:23.969
Now break it on down.

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:31.674
Mr...

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.181
Robinson.

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:03.616
Oh, damn, Kid.

01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:06.085
I'm thinkin'
like a motherfucker, man.

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:08.387
Oh, you gonna get
an "A" today, girl.

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:36.345
Fever! Fever! Fever!

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.727
I'll get you, motherfuckers!

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:54.200
Brothers, atten-hut!

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:00.233
What?

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:02.208
Hey, man, do you hear any music?

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:05.069
No. What up with that?

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.909
Yo, and there ain't
nobody here dancin'.

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:09.280
Aw, shit,
and I wanna shake my ass.
