01:16.480 --> 01:19.313
All right, Bundy.
We've gone right. We've gone left.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.074
I'm gonna send you right up the middle.
Can you do it?

01:22.320 --> 01:23.878
I think so, coach.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.076
Give me the shoe.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.352
On one. Break!

01:35.200 --> 01:36.599
Hut.

01:43.240 --> 01:47.631
See? I told you I was a size five.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.471
I'll take them. How much?

01:50.720 --> 01:52.392
Thirty bucks for the shoes...

01:52.640 --> 01:54.915
...130 for labour.

01:56.720 --> 02:00.030
- All I've got is 20.
- Deal.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.592
Oh, by the way, can we interest you
in our extended warranty?

02:04.800 --> 02:06.028
It's 50 bucks extra...

02:06.240 --> 02:08.435
...but if you get stuck
and can't get them off...

02:08.680 --> 02:10.795
...we'll tow your big ass back here
for free.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.428
Size five.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.438
Why can't women ever admit
to being anything over a size five?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.392
- Yeah.
- That's the good thing about men.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.750
We don't lie about size.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.556
Of course, I don't have to.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.557
Well, neither do I.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.679
Well.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.672
Neither do I.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.878
Contest?

02:50.440 --> 02:51.839
Let's rock.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.949
May I show you something?

03:09.280 --> 03:11.748
It better be shoes.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.395
- I got this one.
- It's my shoe store.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.993
It's Gary's shoe store.

03:16.240 --> 03:19.437
And Gary begat me and I begat you,
so you begat away from me.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.558
Of course.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.395
Hello, Peg.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.909
Hi, honey. I've got good news.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.759
Mom's feeling better
and she can get around on her own.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.679
So can a planet, Peg.
What's that to me?

03:36.160 --> 03:37.718
I'm coming home tomorrow night.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.070
I expect you to pick me up
at the train station.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.599
All right, all right.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.712
Now, my train arrives at 8 p.m. On...

03:47.600 --> 03:53.391
These are nice, but I was looking
for something supple and long-lasting.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.596
That would be me.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.434
I'll be over at 8.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.394
Hey, Griff. I thought since your divorce
you gave up on women.

04:09.640 --> 04:13.633
That's not a woman.
That's a stripper I got a shot with.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.230
She's dancing tomorrow night
at Club Gooey.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.237
You wanna come?

04:21.519 --> 04:24.876
No, I got something
gooey coming in on the train.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.269
- Can I get you some shoes?
- I'm just looking.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.190
Well, how about some duct tape?

04:41.920 --> 04:43.319
He's just hungry.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.279
Well, I'm hungry too,
you don't see me crying.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.795
At least not on the outside.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.670
- Is it okay if I feed him?
- Sure, go ahead. I'm just kidding.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.992
While you're at it,
throw a little something on for me.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.233
What in sam hill are you doing?

05:09.560 --> 05:12.791
- I'm breast-feeding.
- Well, why?

05:13.040 --> 05:15.156
Because he can't cook.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.350
You just told me
it was all right if I fed him.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.149
Well, I meant to give him something
healthy, like an Orange Bang.

05:22.840 --> 05:26.628
You're gonna have to... You're
gonna have to shut that thing off and...

05:26.880 --> 05:29.474
Ooze on down the road.

05:29.720 --> 05:30.948
Let's go, Eric.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.879
But believe me, this isn't the last
you've heard of this.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.432
So much for milk doing a body good.

05:41.800 --> 05:46.396
What is happening to this country,
when a woman of the opposite sex...

05:46.640 --> 05:50.189
...can just waddle into your place
of business, your holy sanctuary...

05:50.440 --> 05:52.237
...and bare her breasts?

05:53.080 --> 05:56.277
- That's disgusting.
- It's repulsive.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.429
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
and thank you for riding Am Train...

06:22.680 --> 06:26.912
...where our motto is,
"I think I can, I think I can."

06:27.160 --> 06:29.469
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you mind if I sit here?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.275
- Do you sell women's shoes?
- God, no.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.159
I transport radioactive sludge
across the country.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.759
Well, as long as you don't sell
women's shoes.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.638
Thank you.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.716
So you're taking that
to a toxic-waste dump?

06:48.960 --> 06:51.349
Yeah. Los Angeles.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.434
Isn't it dangerous to be carrying
that stuff on the train?

06:55.640 --> 06:58.200
I wouldn't concern myself
in the least about that, ma'am.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.437
We are the United States government.
We know what we're doing.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.318
Toxic spill. Run for your lives.

07:10.360 --> 07:14.717
Now, you're sure these shoes aren't
made with any animal byproducts.

07:15.680 --> 07:19.753
Not unless you've come across
a Naugahyde-asaurus lately.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.310
Good. Because
it's against my belief...

07:23.520 --> 07:26.557
...to upset the balance of nature
in any way.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.598
That's why I haven't washed my feet
since I converted.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.311
I hope I haven't offended you.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.438
You've got to have lunch
before you lose it.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.996
How come you always get
the normal people...

07:46.280 --> 07:48.510
...and I always get
the sideshow folk?

07:48.760 --> 07:52.389
Tell you what, Al,
the next one that walks in here...

07:52.640 --> 07:54.517
...you can watch me work.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.355
Hello, honey.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.238
My name is Griff.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.596
I own this mall.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.468
Yeah, did you notice his luxury
Geo Metro...

08:10.720 --> 08:13.109
...with the "Po Boy" vanity plates...

08:13.760 --> 08:16.638
...parked in the executive level Z?

08:20.160 --> 08:23.118
Hey, Dad?
Listen, we just got a call from Mom.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.874
Well, don't blame me,
I didn't give her the number.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.908
Well, we have some good news
and we have some bad news.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.912
There was a train wreck,
but Mom's okay.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.909
So, what's the good news?

08:36.480 --> 08:38.357
She wants you to pick her up
at 1 a. M...

08:38.600 --> 08:42.195
...which is in the morning,
but I'm not sure what time.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.634
Well, for you, that would be
five guys past midnight.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.753
Come to think of it,
we do have some garter belts.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.992
But I'll have to take you in the back
for a fitting.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.111
Isn't it dark back there?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.749
Why, yes, I believe it is.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.358
Okay, Erik and Lyle...

09:05.560 --> 09:08.199
...what else have you got
to put me out of my misery?

09:08.560 --> 09:10.915
Well, I just got another acting job.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.673
Khalil's False Eye Emporium...

09:12.920 --> 09:16.196
...is shooting their commercial
for their Peter Falk birthday sale.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.638
And they want me
to be their wink-wink girl.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.039
You must be very proud.

09:23.280 --> 09:27.717
I'll say. This could be the springboard
to my own sitcom on Fox.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.435
Well, usually that comes
before the Khalil eye job.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.915
Anyway, I just need $100
for wardrobe and makeup.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.917
- I promise I'll pay you back.
- All right.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.430
Just buy me a nice headstone.
We'll call it even.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.032
You got it, big guy.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.350
We're not going to buy him
a headstone, are we?

09:46.560 --> 09:50.758
No. Mom already sold him
to that medical school in Mexico.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.438
So how's that garter belt
working out?

09:59.680 --> 10:02.148
I can't tell. There's no mirror in here.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.437
Well, that's why
I brought this Polaroid.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.875
Well, the wife's away
and the kids are gone.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.712
There's no one here to annoy me.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.832
- AI Bundy.
- No.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.916
Did you banish this woman and
her child from your store yesterday?

10:21.160 --> 10:22.115
I did.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.118
How dare you deny her
her God-given right to nurse her baby...

10:25.360 --> 10:27.590
...whenever Mother Nature calls.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.357
Breast-feeding
is a natural biological function.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.797
So is peeing, but you don't see me
doing that in public.

10:39.320 --> 10:43.632
Well, the last time I looked,
the side of my garage was in public.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.278
Marcie.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.909
You may have noticed
that this is a place of business.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.391
Are you going to allow this woman
to nurse or not?

10:59.680 --> 11:02.274
Marcie, in the words
of your own people:

11:02.520 --> 11:04.590
"Cluck no."

11:08.520 --> 11:11.717
Then you leave me no choice.

11:17.040 --> 11:21.158
Left, right, left, right, left,
right, left, right, left, right.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.392
Company halt!

11:24.640 --> 11:27.234
Present babies.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.193
Express milk.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.599
We apologize
for our little toxic incident...

11:48.840 --> 11:51.673
...but feel free to k eep
your souvenir decontamination suits...

11:51.920 --> 11:54.036
...and thank you for riding Am Train...

11:54.280 --> 11:58.239
...where we care
and we settle out of court.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.396
Do you mind if I sit down?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.831
Is that a pie you're carrying?

12:04.080 --> 12:07.550
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, park it, granny.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.430
Decontamination
sure takes a lot out of you.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.592
Not that the barium wasn't fun.

12:15.840 --> 12:20.630
Would you like to have a piece
of banana cream pie?

12:20.880 --> 12:22.996
Well, I'm on a diet...

12:23.240 --> 12:25.151
...but I'm sure bananas are on it.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.920
That'll be $50.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.632
Forget it. I'll just wait
until they serve dinner.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.872
All right.
Who ordered the kosher meal?

12:35.120 --> 12:37.918
Anyone? Anyone?

12:39.800 --> 12:44.191
Okay. Here's your 50 bucks.
Now give me.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.473
Have you got a fork?

12:46.720 --> 12:48.995
It'll cost you.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.319
Well, never mind.
I'll just eat it just like this.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.235
Attention, Am Train surviv ors.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.313
We seem to have run
into some minor difficulty.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.198
Have you got a napkin?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.072
Well, yes.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.880
Twenty dollars.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.950
Dad, I hate to bother you again, but...

13:36.600 --> 13:38.716
Well, there's a Kodak moment.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.873
So, what do you want, son?

13:42.120 --> 13:44.680
Mom wanted me to tell you
she was in another train wreck.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.709
Son, your mother is a train wreck.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.949
Now, as you can see,
I'm busy with suckle-palooza here.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.040
Is there any part of your story
that's of interest to me?

13:55.280 --> 13:58.556
Just that Mom's coming in at 3 a.m.,
and she expects you to be there.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.233
See you.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.678
Well, the train station at 3 a.m.

14:02.920 --> 14:07.755
It'll just be me and Streisand picking up
our loved ones from Wanker County.

14:11.120 --> 14:14.476
So, Al. Now that you see
how serious we are...

14:14.680 --> 14:16.557
...are you ready to listen
to our demands?

14:16.760 --> 14:18.159
Not yet.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.511
Now I'm ready.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.388
Fine.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.593
Hit it, girls.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.712
We shall not, we shall not be moved

14:28.920 --> 14:29.875
Go ahead, sing.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.753
We shall not
We shall not be moved

14:33.000 --> 14:34.752
Sing and nurse, nurse and sing...

14:34.960 --> 14:37.190
...but mark my words,
you shall not win this one.

14:37.440 --> 14:38.668
Men will rally around me.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.917
They'll march through the shadow
of the valley of your immensity...

14:42.120 --> 14:43.792
...see the righteousness
of my cause.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.791
For men are trustworthy, loyal and...

14:47.040 --> 14:48.632
We shall not be moved

14:48.880 --> 14:51.633
We shall not
We shall not be moved

14:52.000 --> 14:55.515
We shall not
We shall not be moved

14:55.760 --> 14:58.911
We shall not
We shall not be...

15:15.960 --> 15:19.032
Jefferson, you little wuss.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.595
How could you do this
to your own breed?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.159
Marcie made me do it.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.960
She said she didn't have enough
women for her protest...

15:27.200 --> 15:29.873
...so it was either this or get a job.

15:30.520 --> 15:34.195
- Oh, how low.
- A job? I agree.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.517
Not that, J. Edgar... Give me this doll.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.790
You know what I've a good mind
to do with this?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.429
Give it back to the little girl
I took it from?

15:45.120 --> 15:46.951
Exactly.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.790
There, sweetie. That's a good girl.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.996
Jefferson,
you know what this means?

15:56.240 --> 15:57.673
No, don't tell the guys.

15:57.920 --> 16:01.276
I couldn't take another night
of a thousand wedgies.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.277
All right, there's one way
you can buy my silence.

16:06.440 --> 16:10.513
That's cruel. That's horrible.
That's evil.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.591
I'll do it.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.514
Now that we've weeded
one traitor out of the ranks...

16:25.760 --> 16:29.958
...let's see if we have any more
Mrs. Doubtfires here.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.671
You're a woman.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.391
And you're a comet.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.629
One, two, three, four
We will breast-feed in your store

16:53.880 --> 16:57.395
One, two, three, four
We will breast-feed in your store

16:57.640 --> 17:02.111
Well, Bob, this is
Miranda Veracruz de la Jolla Cardenal...

17:02.520 --> 17:07.913
...live at the mall, where the so-called
Chicago lactathon is still going strong.

17:08.160 --> 17:12.869
But yet, Mr. Bundy,
you seem strangely unmoved. Why so?

17:13.119 --> 17:14.791
Well...

17:15.040 --> 17:16.916
...Miranda.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.550
First of all, I know
that I'm on the side of good.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.950
And secondly...

17:23.200 --> 17:25.873
...I need the overtime.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.236
Nonetheless, I can see
that this protest...

17:28.480 --> 17:30.948
...has completely
paralysed your business.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.988
I can see you've never shopped
in the store before.

17:35.240 --> 17:38.073
Be that as it may,
you can't let this go on forever.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.639
What do you plan to do?

17:39.880 --> 17:42.110
Well, all I can say is,
Al Bundy never says "die."

17:42.360 --> 17:46.592
Well, he says "die,"
he just never does.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.876
If you'll just bring your cameras
this way...

17:51.120 --> 17:53.270
...you will see the master at work.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.839
Now, Marcie.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.432
Before I unleash
my ultimate weapon...

17:57.680 --> 18:02.037
...I'm going to be gracious and give you
and your Milk Duds there...

18:02.280 --> 18:04.874
...a chance to hoof it on out of here.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.633
What do you say?

18:06.880 --> 18:09.633
No way, Old Smeller.

18:10.480 --> 18:15.270
We have drawn our line in the sand
and we shall not be moved.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.988
- Yeah!
- Fine.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.800
If you want an all-out war...

18:21.160 --> 18:23.230
...you've got one.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.949
No Ma'am heavyweight division,
company halt.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.519
Present...

18:37.720 --> 18:38.948
...beer bellies!

18:49.200 --> 18:51.760
Boogie down.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.112
What the hell is going on here?

19:06.360 --> 19:08.271
Counterprotest. We're dancing.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.590
Hell, that ain't dancing.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.909
This is dancing.

19:14.560 --> 19:17.632
One, two, three, four
We will breast-feed in your store

19:17.880 --> 19:19.711
One, two, three, four
We will...

19:30.720 --> 19:31.709
Bud, wake up.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.836
Oh, La Toya.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.557
Did you foresee
our love in advance?

19:44.480 --> 19:46.550
Bud, wake up.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.791
You were dreaming again.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.110
Was it the Judds?

19:52.600 --> 19:54.955
No, the Jacksons.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.676
It wasn't Tito, was it?

20:03.040 --> 20:04.917
I'm afraid so.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.916
He was just teaching me
how to dance.

20:10.840 --> 20:14.594
Who cares. My commercial's coming
on for Khalil's False Eye-Emporium.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.353
Hi, I'm Kelly for Khalil's...

20:16.600 --> 20:19.160
We now bring you
this important news bulletin.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.628
Just my luck.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.513
Every time I get a commercial,
some stupid war breaks out...

20:23.720 --> 20:26.075
...in some stupid country
I can't even pronounce.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.515
That could be France.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.156
I said "country."

20:34.400 --> 20:37.437
One, two, three, four
We will breast-feed in your store

20:37.680 --> 20:40.353
I'm Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal...

20:40.600 --> 20:42.750
...still here at Gary's Shoe Store...

20:42.960 --> 20:45.997
...because, quite frankly,
I have a mortgage to pay.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.073
It's really anyone's guess
how this one will turn out.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.311
But my guess is, since it is 4 a. M...

20:51.560 --> 20:55.269
...you're either watching
Gilligan's Island or you're on it.

20:55.640 --> 20:56.993
Another late-breaking story.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.350
An unidentified woman
waiting for her husband...

20:59.600 --> 21:01.318
...was chased
from the train station...

21:01.520 --> 21:03.988
...by a gang of people
at 3 a.m. This morning.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.877
But then again, this is Chicago,
so that's not really news.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.553
Back to you, Miranda.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.789
What kind of woman would hang out at
the train station at 3:00 in the morning?

21:32.400 --> 21:35.631
Hi, kids. I'm home.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.189
So where's your father?

21:38.440 --> 21:42.479
- This better be good.
- Oh, it is.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.473
One, two, three, four
We will breast-feed in your store

21:46.305 --> 21:52.860
