This isn't right!

30:37.280 --> 30:41.717
This isn't your brain anymore,
Mr. Pittman.

30:41.880 --> 30:44.440
We control the horizontal.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.830
We control the vertical.

We control it all.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.677
to fix that code.

No!

31:06.120 --> 31:08.031
No!

31:08.720 --> 31:13.112
We can make things very uncomfortable
for you in here, Mr. Pittman.

We can make your life hell.

31:15.720 --> 31:17.438

to figure it out.</i>

If you concentrate,
you can control it.

Three.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.789
You can't do anything to me.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.156
This is my mind.

Your mind...

32:01.480 --> 32:03.835
...belongs to us.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.673
You're bluffing.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.669
You're a machine.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.351
You're parts and programming.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.831
And you're dying, and you're losing
control every second,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.118

33:53.920 --> 33:54.955
Aaron, what have you done?

33:55.200 --> 33:58.352
If you or your men
take one step towards us,

33:58.600 --> 34:00.876
I will cut your throat.

34:14.040 --> 34:16.554
What you went through
must have been insane.

It wasn't all bad...
I had a cold beer, and that was nice.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.919
What are we going to do now?

35:21.720 --> 35:25.156
I just want to go home.
