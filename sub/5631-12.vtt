00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:01.469 --> 00:02.236
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.571 --> 00:04.972
sexually based offenses

00:04.972 --> 00:07.175
are considered especially
heinous.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.410
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.410 --> 00:11.011
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.011 --> 00:12.846
are members of an elite squad

00:12.846 --> 00:14.948
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.550
These are their stories.

00:18.152 --> 00:21.855
- So, Richard, the father,
had a ruptured spleen

00:21.855 --> 00:24.125
and internal bleeding.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.593
And Tess--

00:25.593 --> 00:27.328
- The teenage daughter
who was raped.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.029
- Yeah, she's traumatized.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.199
That's gonna be
a long road.

00:31.199 --> 00:36.104
But it also turns out
that Joe, the ringleader,

00:36.104 --> 00:40.441
and his girlfriend were both
serially abused as children.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.377
He had brain damage
from beatings,

00:43.377 --> 00:45.646
from drug use.

00:45.646 --> 00:49.483
So, I mean, this is
an endless cycle of abuse.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.285
- What would happen
if you stopped?

00:51.285 --> 00:53.787
- I can't.
Rollins is still out.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.889
I have a new sergeant
who's barely up to speed--

00:55.889 --> 00:59.026
- You just said
it's an endless cycle.

00:59.026 --> 01:03.297
- Yes, but I--
I don't feel that way.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.367
I have hope.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.601
- Yeah.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.138
- Look, I'm fine.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.275
I wasn't actually shot.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.778
My injuries were
powder burns.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.313
- No nightmares?
No flashbacks?

01:19.313 --> 01:21.215
- Yeah, I do.
I have both of those.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.284
It's nothing new.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.287
- And Noah?

01:30.057 --> 01:32.660
- I can barely let him
out of my sight.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.997
No, he's all I could
think about--

01:36.997 --> 01:39.267
- When you were
being held at gunpoint.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.171
But you have to go back?

01:43.171 --> 01:46.174
No one but you
can do this job?

01:46.174 --> 01:48.609
- I came here
because I'm fine.

01:48.609 --> 01:52.246
I came here
because I'm ready.

01:52.246 --> 01:55.349
Now I just need you
to sign off on that.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.050
[bell rings]

02:00.354 --> 02:02.423
- 'Sup, brother?

02:02.423 --> 02:04.392
[indistinct chatter]

02:07.995 --> 02:10.198
- Abby.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.566
Chris Roberts is, like,
staring at you.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.935
- Really, me?

02:14.935 --> 02:16.870
He's a senior.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.606
- I know.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.074
- Dude, I'd hit that, bro.

02:21.074 --> 02:24.245
- If you don't,
I will.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.779
Unless you want the shot.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.048
- Yeah.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.049
Sure.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.083
Totally.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.353
- Come on.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.422
- So on the one hand,
the Montagues.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.257
On the other hand,
the Capulets.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.358
[phone chimes]

02:37.358 --> 02:39.260
Two houses divided.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.895
Fate versus free will.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.397
The family the heroes
are born into...

02:43.397 --> 02:45.399
- Chris just asked me
to the solstice dance.

02:45.399 --> 02:48.469
- Tell me when
you're done, Abby.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.404
The family the heroes
are born into

02:50.404 --> 02:54.708
versus what's
in their hearts.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.511
- Just giving Chris
a sneak peek.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.581
You gotta get sexy
to be sexy.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.251
- You guys look so nice.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.386
That's a pretty dress, Abby.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.021
Andrew,
where's the camera?

03:08.021 --> 03:10.023
- Totally prepared.
- Dad.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.926
- Come on, both of you, smile.
Come on.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.895
Ah, that's right.
Babe, get in there.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.264
[chuckling]

03:16.264 --> 03:17.565
- Mom.
- Oh, that's great.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.401
- Okay! Okay!
- Oh.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.135
That's great.
- Dad, we gotta get ready.

03:22.135 --> 03:25.306
- We get it,
we get it.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.375
[phone buzzes]

03:27.375 --> 03:29.610
- Look, from Chris.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.045
- * Closer

03:32.045 --> 03:33.614
- "RUH"?

03:33.614 --> 03:34.948
- Oh, that's good.

03:34.948 --> 03:38.919
That means he's into you.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.554
- * When we touch...

03:40.554 --> 03:42.590
- * Let me see
your bass face *

03:42.590 --> 03:43.957
* Your bass face

03:43.957 --> 03:45.759
- You want some?

03:45.759 --> 03:47.127
- Sure.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.297
* Watch that dirty break,
break *

03:49.297 --> 03:57.338
*

04:18.326 --> 04:20.828
- Um...

04:20.828 --> 04:25.333
I'm thinking we should
maybe go downstairs.

04:25.333 --> 04:29.437
How about you?

04:29.437 --> 04:31.372
- Okay.

04:31.372 --> 04:35.376
*

04:35.376 --> 04:37.345
- Get-get-get it, son!

04:37.345 --> 04:38.779
- Shh, stop it.

04:38.779 --> 04:46.820
*

04:54.362 --> 04:56.464
- Wait, slow down.
Not down there.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.466
- Sorry.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.005
You feel nice.
Is that good?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.475
- [groans]
Not so hard.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.543
- * See your bass face

05:09.543 --> 05:12.145
- Oh, you're so hot, Abby.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.582
- [groaning]

05:17.385 --> 05:18.719
- There she is.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.555
- Hey, how was the party,
honey?

05:21.555 --> 05:24.792
- Fine.
I'm just tired.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.027
Good night.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.774
[phone buzzes]

05:52.252 --> 05:53.286
[phone beeps]

05:57.425 --> 05:59.427
[phone buzzes]

06:20.581 --> 06:23.584
[dramatic music]

07:06.527 --> 07:06.660
.

07:07.394 --> 07:07.895
- Wow, she's beautiful.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.931
- Not at 4:00 A.M.,
she's not.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.233
- Oh, she's a newborn.
It gets easier.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.368
- Enjoy maternity, Amanda.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.037
When my sister had
to go back to work,

07:17.037 --> 07:18.572
it was the most
wrenching thing.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.007
- Carisi.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.575
- Amanda's
coming back soon, right?

07:21.575 --> 07:23.410
- Well, NYPD only gives
six weeks maternity.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.513
- No, she can use
her accrued vacation time.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.747
She'll figure it out.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.748
- They let you take a year
with no pay.

07:27.748 --> 07:28.849
- That's not gonna happen.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.151
- Okay, guys,
can we not discuss me

07:31.151 --> 07:32.219
in front of me?

07:32.219 --> 07:34.321
- Lieutenant Benson.
Oh, look, a baby.

07:34.321 --> 07:37.725
Liv, you got a minute?

07:37.725 --> 07:39.226
- Wow.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.028
- I'm representing
a 15-year-old freshman

07:41.028 --> 07:42.129
at the Dowland School.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.731
- 15.
What's he been accused of?

07:43.731 --> 07:45.398
- No, her name's
Abby Stewart.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.167
She's the victim.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.637
- Working as an advocate?

07:49.637 --> 07:52.773
What is this, penance for
representing a serial killer?

07:52.773 --> 07:54.675
- You're still holding
that against me.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.944
- Yes.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.246
- Well, her mother and I
went to Dowland together.

07:59.246 --> 08:02.583
Abby was raped at
a school dance last Friday.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.384
- Okay, so almost
a week ago.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.886
- Disclosure wasn't
that late.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.420
But when they went
to their local precinct,

08:07.420 --> 08:09.056
they were told
there was no case.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.424
- Well, that's how precincts
keep their rape stats low.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.026
- I've known Abby
since birth.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.595
She's not making this up,

08:14.595 --> 08:17.598
but the boy is a schoolmate,
Chris Roberts, 18.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.966
She was his date,

08:18.966 --> 08:21.769
went with him willingly
to a makeout room

08:21.769 --> 08:23.771
where they had
consensual foreplay.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.574
- None of that matters, Rita.
You know that.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.908
- [sighs]

08:27.908 --> 08:30.611
- So a late disclosure,
so no rape kit.

08:30.611 --> 08:34.882
- No, but the maid saw
Abby's dress was stained.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.585
Showed it to Laura,
her mom.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.620
- So when the mother
asked the daughter about it--

08:39.620 --> 08:41.589
- The story tumbled out.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.457
Abby's introverted.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.360
She was a virgin.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.062
Will you meet with them?

08:49.062 --> 08:51.331
- Of course.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.369
- We so appreciate you
coming to our home.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.805
Rita says you're the best.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.907
- Well, I hope she
also explained to you

08:59.907 --> 09:02.009
that cases like this
can be complicated.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.777
- The local cops
treated our daughter

09:03.777 --> 09:05.613
like she was the one
who was at fault.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.280
- That won't be happening
with SVU.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.383
- Okay,
so how does this work?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.119
- Well, we'll need
to take a statement

09:12.119 --> 09:13.621
from the three of you.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.222
Also we'll need access
to Abby's friends

09:15.222 --> 09:16.624
and social media.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.659
- We understand
that there was a dress.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.893
- There is.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.994
- Okay, we'll send it
to the lab.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.763
- So in terms of speaking
with your daughter,

09:22.763 --> 09:26.066
sometimes it's easier
if the parents aren't around.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.500
- They're aware.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.803
And so is Abby.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.705
- I've known who Chris is
for years.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.641
We were in drama club
together.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.142
- Okay, so you were friends.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.210
- Not really.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.881
He didn't even notice me
until a couple weeks ago.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.683
He started texting me.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.351
Sexting, really.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.487
- Okay.
Did you text him back?

09:47.487 --> 09:49.256
- I wasn't slutty.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.891
Maybe a little flirty.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.893
- We saved the texts,
and I've cautioned Abby

09:52.893 --> 09:54.828
against communicating
any further with him.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.430
- I still do see Chris
at school.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.900
- That's got to
be difficult.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.070
So have you had any
communication with him since?

10:03.070 --> 10:06.073
- No.
Well, yes.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.341
Sort of...

10:08.341 --> 10:09.877
Just saying hi.

10:09.877 --> 10:12.445
Didn't know what else to do.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.613
- She came home
around 11:00.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.448
I-I could tell
there was something wrong.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.884
- How do you mean?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.686
- She always wants to talk
after a night out.

10:18.686 --> 10:19.920
She went straight
to her room.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.188
- She said she was tired.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.856
- She was in distress,
Andrew.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.291
I should have
made her talk to me.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.693
- All right, but when
you did find that dress,

10:25.693 --> 10:27.194
you asked her about it.
That was good.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.596
- Well, my housekeeper,
Pilar, found the dress

10:29.596 --> 10:31.098
in the trash
on Tuesday.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.532
When Abby came home
from school,

10:32.532 --> 10:34.668
I asked her
why she'd thrown it away.

10:34.668 --> 10:38.205
She said that she had sex,
that she didn't want to,

10:38.205 --> 10:39.639
that she was raped.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.909
- We went straight
to the police that night.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.744
- Did your daughter tell
anybody else what had happened?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.012
Any friends?

10:45.012 --> 10:48.015
- Not that I know of,
but something did happen.

10:48.015 --> 10:51.719
- We were making out.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.688
He asked if I wanted
to go somewhere private.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.189
I liked him.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.858
I wanted him to like me.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.693
- You liked him,
you kissed him.

10:59.693 --> 11:03.363
That doesn't mean
you wanted anything more.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.432
- Okay, Abby, so where
did he take you?

11:05.432 --> 11:08.068
- The school darkroom.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.636
It's where people
go hook up.

11:09.636 --> 11:12.806
Go to the darkroom,
see what develops.

11:12.806 --> 11:16.376
First we were just
making out.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.046
Then he put his hand
under my dress.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.447
I got nervous.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.449
- Okay. Did you
tell him to stop?

11:22.449 --> 11:24.451
- I told him
not to go down there.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.753
To slow down.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.820
- And did he?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.655
- No.
He wasn't listening.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.091
He pushed me
up against a wall.

11:31.091 --> 11:35.595
I felt him get...
excited.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.830
He pulled down my underwear.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.666
He put a finger
inside me.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.634
- Okay.
So what happened next?

11:41.634 --> 11:44.838
- I said, "Wait."
So he stopped.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.775
But then he tried
to put his...

11:47.775 --> 11:51.311
penis inside me.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.815
- Okay. Did you say no
when he did that?

11:57.918 --> 12:00.220
Abby?

12:01.588 --> 12:03.623
Did you say yes?

12:05.893 --> 12:07.928
- I couldn't move
or speak.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.297
It was like
I was paralyzed.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.664
- That's not unusual.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.901
- She's right.

12:15.869 --> 12:19.807
- It wasn't really
getting in.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.042
He kept saying
I was hot,

12:22.042 --> 12:25.678
and then I guess he...came.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.682
I don't understand.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.052
Why would Chris
do that to me?

12:36.689 --> 12:38.491
- Abby and I are friends.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.027
- Okay, good.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.529
The two of you went to the dance
together last Friday?

12:42.529 --> 12:43.530
- Yeah.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.597
- What happened?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.599
- What exactly
is she saying happened?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.735
- We just want to hear
your son's side.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.570
- His side?
He didn't do anything wrong.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.840
- Then there's no harm
in telling us about it.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.708
- Go ahead, son.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.578
- Okay, Abby and I
were dancing,

12:58.578 --> 13:00.513
and we made out a little.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.849
She was into it.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.852
- Anything else?

13:04.852 --> 13:07.354
- I asked her if she wanted
to go to the darkroom.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.490
That's code for--

13:11.624 --> 13:13.160
We started fooling around.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.995
- "Fooling around"?
That's it?

13:14.995 --> 13:16.864
- Yeah,
just messing around.

13:16.864 --> 13:20.868
- Is this girl making
a rape allegation?

13:20.868 --> 13:22.635
- She's saying
something happened

13:22.635 --> 13:24.304
that she didn't want
to happen.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.874
- That is so not true.
We didn't even have sex.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.876
- Okay, if that's the case,
just give us a DNA sample,

13:28.876 --> 13:30.477
and this whole thing
goes away.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.645
- Whoa, I don't--
- Do you have a warrant?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.481
- Yes, we do.
- Oh, my God.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.883
- You should have told us.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.117
And I'll be contacting
a lawyer.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.718
- No, it's fine.
Nothing happened.

13:38.718 --> 13:39.887
- No, I'm sure
nothing happened.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.889
I--listen, I know
how these things go,

13:41.889 --> 13:43.490
how girls are.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.892
- We understand this is
very upsetting, ma'am,

13:44.892 --> 13:46.459
but right now
we're just investigating.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.628
- No, before our daughter
went to college,

13:48.628 --> 13:50.063
I'd overhear
her friends talking,

13:50.063 --> 13:51.899
saying that they would
accuse a boy of rape

13:51.899 --> 13:53.901
if he didn't
call them back.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.069
- We do have a warrant
for your son's DNA.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.637
We can collect that here

13:57.637 --> 14:00.007
or we can take him
down to the station.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.275
It's your call.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.578
- So what's your take
on the boy?

14:05.578 --> 14:06.980
- He's privileged
but not arrogant.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.715
- No record, straight As.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.783
Waiting on an early
decision from Stanford.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.986
- He seems genuinely surprised
by the allegation.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.821
- Okay, so it sounds like
a teenage he said/she said.

14:14.821 --> 14:15.822
- It's more like

14:15.822 --> 14:17.790
her-parents-say/
his-parents-say.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.093
Chris's mom, he's her
only son, the golden boy.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.495
- And the father of
a teenage virginal daughter?

14:22.495 --> 14:23.997
Like, my dad
with my sisters.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.632
If a guy so much
as looked at one of them,

14:25.632 --> 14:27.800
it's rape.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.938
- Hold on, Chris puts himself
in the darkroom with Abby?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.839
- He does, but he swears
nothing happened

14:32.839 --> 14:34.641
beyond some kissing
and touching.

14:34.641 --> 14:35.943
- Well, he's lying about that.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.111
The lab confirms
that the semen stains

14:38.111 --> 14:41.248
on Abby's dress
is a match for Chris.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.751
- Okay, that's contact,
but that's not proof of rape

14:44.751 --> 14:45.953
or even intercourse.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.454
- Whoa, this might be.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.322
Chris posted photos
of the two of them

14:49.322 --> 14:53.026
on his Instagram account,
hashtag "picked that cherry.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.327
Sweet."

14:54.327 --> 14:57.030
- "Picked that cherry,"
really?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.366
- Kids fronting on social media
doesn't mean it happened.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.168
They lie all the time.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.971
- And these pictures don't look
like she's complaining.

15:10.010 --> 15:10.143
.

15:14.114 --> 15:14.581
- What can I do for you?

15:15.882 --> 15:17.384
- I heard about
the DNA match.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.386
I assume you're going
to arrest this boy?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.021
- Where did you hear that?

15:21.021 --> 15:22.722
- I didn't, but you
just confirmed it.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.992
- Rita, you don't have
an all access pass here.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.094
- Hey, Lieutenant,
Barba's in there.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.465
- Rita, the boy's
lawyered up already?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.034
- Actually, I'm here
for the victim.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.468
- Oh, so you take money
from both sides.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.869
Don't ever change.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.271
You do know that
you can't be privy

15:38.271 --> 15:39.639
to the boy's interview.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.873
- She does
and she's leaving.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.075
- And Buchanan's here.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.110
- Well, now it's a party.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.811
- As much fun
as it would be

15:44.811 --> 15:47.314
to get the band
back together, Rita,

15:47.314 --> 15:50.383
the Robertses have
retained only me this time.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.784
They'll be up in a bit.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.386
- I'm here representing
the Stewarts.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.155
- Victim advocacy.
That can't pay well.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.723
- It's pro bono.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.392
Not all of us have to worry
about our next meal.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.028
- Getting personal,
that's promising.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.295
- Rita was just leaving.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.896
- I'll be right down
the block.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.066
- This won't take long.

16:06.066 --> 16:10.037
In about 20 minutes,
you'll realize you have no case.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.640
- This is serious.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.576
We got a DNA match.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.245
And you lied
about sexual contact.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.180
- I didn't--
- Let me answer, son.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.883
This is awkward, but it was the
boy's first sexual encounter.

16:23.883 --> 16:27.087
He got excited and finished
before anything even started.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.655
- Not according
to Instagram.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.257
- He was trying
to impress his friends.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.858
- Then why did Abby
accuse you of rape?

16:31.858 --> 16:33.893
- How do you expect him
to explain that?

16:33.893 --> 16:35.328
- This girl
is obviously lying.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.097
- Why don't you
let Chris talk?

16:37.097 --> 16:38.498
- I'm here to speak for him.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.334
Chris was shocked
by these allegations.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.903
As far as he knew,
he and Abby were friends.

16:43.903 --> 16:47.107
- She still thinks we are.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.409
- Huh.
Help yourselves.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.512
- "I don't know
why this is happening.

16:52.512 --> 16:56.183
I like you.
I hope you're not mad at me."

16:56.183 --> 16:57.617
- See?
She's fine.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.086
- Oh, boy,
that's not good.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.287
Am I right, counselor?

17:00.287 --> 17:01.688
- Like a broken clock.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.857
- Okay, so she's
an imperfect victim.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.793
- Call your friend Calhoun.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.496
- My friend.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.865
- I never thought
I'd say this,

17:12.865 --> 17:14.367
but thank God
for texting.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.835
- [chuckles]
I'm tempted to send

17:15.835 --> 17:18.305
that girl's family
my legal bill.

17:20.273 --> 17:23.110
- So I assume
this will be the last

17:23.110 --> 17:24.611
we hear of the matter,
counselor?

17:24.611 --> 17:26.146
- We'll be in touch.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.718
Rita, we have a problem.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.453
- No, we don't.
I've already spoken with Abby,

17:33.453 --> 17:35.288
and this isn't anything
we haven't seen before.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.524
- Really? Because if you were
that boy's defense attorney,

17:37.524 --> 17:39.126
you'd tear her to shreds.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.627
- Put this into context.
Abby's insecure.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.329
She's non-confrontational.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.896
If she were more assertive,
we might not even be here.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.232
- She was assertive enough
to text him.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.734
- She was answering
his texts every time.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.736
There's no social protocol
with teenagers.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.538
Do you un-friend?
Do you block?

17:51.538 --> 17:52.972
They don't think
things through.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.141
- I understand,
but Buchanan's gonna

17:54.141 --> 17:55.575
crucify her
in front of a jury.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.545
- This boy lured Abby
into the school's darkroom,

17:58.545 --> 17:59.979
boasted on the internet
they had sex,

17:59.979 --> 18:01.281
lied to the police.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.882
- What do you want me to do?

18:02.882 --> 18:04.384
- There were a hundred kids
at that dance.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.620
Have you talked
to any of them?

18:07.620 --> 18:10.390
- Everyone knows the darkroom
is where you have sex.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.059
Once you go down there,
you can't change your mind.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.962
- Actually, you can,
Daniella, at any time.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.365
- Maybe, but there's
no way Abby did.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.367
She's obsessed with Chris.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.369
- So you think she's just
making this up?

18:22.369 --> 18:24.571
- I don't know.

18:24.571 --> 18:28.040
She could just be mad that Chris
didn't ask her out again.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.211
- [laughs]

18:31.211 --> 18:34.013
- Will Moore?
Jack Peters?

18:34.013 --> 18:35.014
- Yeah.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.049
- NYPD.
We got a couple questions.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.084
- About Chris?

18:38.084 --> 18:40.420
What people are saying
is unfair.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.223
He didn't do anything to Abby
she wasn't asking for.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.724
- She was asking for it?

18:44.724 --> 18:46.092
That's what you heard too?

18:46.092 --> 18:47.260
- Yeah, I guess.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.096
I got to go study, so...

18:52.932 --> 18:55.034
- Look, I don't want
to bad-mouth her,

18:55.034 --> 18:56.769
but Abby's just trying
to get attention.

18:56.769 --> 18:57.937
- Trying to avoid us, Jack?

18:57.937 --> 19:00.740
- No, I just
don't know anything.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.974
- What's the matter,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.976
were you down in that
darkroom with her too?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.012
- You know, she's only 15.
You're 18.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.347
Know what that means?

19:07.347 --> 19:09.449
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I did not touch her.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.484
- Yeah, but Chris did though,
didn't he?

19:11.484 --> 19:15.121
Come on, talk to us or we're
gonna have to call your parents.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.123
- You know what, why don't
we just call Notre Dame?

19:17.123 --> 19:18.458
He's the one waiting to hear

19:18.458 --> 19:20.227
about that football
scholarship, right?

19:20.227 --> 19:23.230
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
don't--don't do that.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.232
- Give us a reason not to.

19:28.034 --> 19:32.104
- Chris needed a name
on his list.

19:32.104 --> 19:35.375
- What list?

19:35.375 --> 19:39.045
- This secret society
for seniors.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.813
Nos Messis Cerasa.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.114
It's...

19:42.114 --> 19:44.951
It's Latin for
"Cherry Pickers Club."

19:47.153 --> 19:50.257
- What's the big secret?

19:50.257 --> 19:51.624
- It's this competition

19:51.624 --> 19:53.893
to see how many virgins
you can bang,

19:53.893 --> 19:58.164
and everybody had a name
on the list except for Chris.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.069
So, here, it's behind
this portrait.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.882
[dramatic music]

20:15.882 --> 20:20.553
*

20:20.553 --> 20:21.754
- How old were these girls?

20:21.754 --> 20:23.055
- I don't know.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.525
The ones on mine were,
like, 16 or 17,

20:25.525 --> 20:27.059
but they came after me, okay?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.761
I could show you
the selfies they sent me.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.229
- That's okay.
We get it.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.265
- Chris only has
Abby listed?

20:32.265 --> 20:34.100
- Yeah, it's a good thing
he didn't get shut out,

20:34.100 --> 20:36.202
'cause that wall's there
forever.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.277
- Basically, Chris just
needed to make the wall.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.545
- Good to know.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.046
- Oh, counselor,
you're not gonna

20:47.046 --> 20:48.180
use this list though,
are you?

20:48.180 --> 20:49.316
- It goes to motive.

20:49.316 --> 20:50.817
- Yeah, but it also outs
a lot of teenagers.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.519
I mean, the guys, whatever.
Who cares about them?

20:52.519 --> 20:53.753
But these girls--

20:53.753 --> 20:55.522
- They don't want
this list going public.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.490
- Come on, like they haven't
posted darkroom selfies

20:57.490 --> 20:58.958
on their Facebook pages
already?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.993
We're dealing with
hormone-flooded teenagers.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.229
I know things are grey here,
but this is 50 shades of it.

21:03.229 --> 21:04.964
- I'm with Dodds.
I don't think this kid

21:04.964 --> 21:07.033
knew anything was wrong
till we showed up at his house.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.668
- He lied to your faces.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.036
- Yeah, and so did she

21:10.036 --> 21:12.972
when she said she wasn't
texting him anymore.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.808
- Okay, I think that
the kid is good for it,

21:15.808 --> 21:18.978
but going to trial
with where we are now...

21:18.978 --> 21:20.913
I think you need
to sit both families down

21:20.913 --> 21:22.382
and hammer out a plea.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.250
- I'll see what I can do.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.988
- A plea?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.923
Of misdemeanor
sexual misconduct?

21:30.923 --> 21:32.859
No.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.827
- I can't offer felony rape
or even attempted rape.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.363
A public defender
would balk at that.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.764
- There are other felonies.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.566
What about sending
indecent material

21:39.566 --> 21:41.033
to a minor via the texts.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.502
- The texts are pathetic,

21:42.502 --> 21:44.170
but I'm not sure
that they're indecent.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.739
Sexual misconduct does get him
on the sex offenders registry.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.375
Even if he doesn't
do jail time,

21:48.375 --> 21:50.242
his DNA goes into
the database,

21:50.242 --> 21:52.379
and being on the registry
is quite severe.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.681
- As it should be.
- No.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.083
He raped my daughter.
He should go to prison!

21:57.083 --> 21:58.551
- We're all upset
about what happened to Abby,

21:58.551 --> 22:00.286
but putting her
through a trial?

22:00.286 --> 22:03.022
There's a good chance that
does not result in a conviction.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.123
Counselor?

22:04.123 --> 22:05.658
- Mr. Barba
is making good points.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.627
Even with the rape shield law,

22:07.627 --> 22:10.196
the press will be all over
this story if we go forward.

22:10.196 --> 22:13.099
- The press?
My life is over.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.034
Everybody at school
is whispering about me,

22:15.034 --> 22:16.035
laughing at me.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.404
- Abby, honey, please--

22:17.404 --> 22:19.038
- Chris' friends hate me.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.074
My friends hate me.
I wish I'd never said anything.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.917
- I'm sorry.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.087
This is all I can do.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.826
- We'll take
sexual misconduct.

22:39.826 --> 22:44.431
As long as Chris Roberts
goes on the registry.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.234
- The registry?
Absolutely not.

22:48.234 --> 22:49.502
- This is the best plea
I can offer.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.970
Your son would avoid

22:50.970 --> 22:52.672
the publicity and trauma
of a trial.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.141
- But he'd be put on a list
with rapists and pedophiles.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.476
What about college?

22:56.476 --> 22:58.144
- Chris just got
early acceptance to Stanford.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.579
- That's nice.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.881
- If he goes on the list,
he can't have a smartphone.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.450
He can't even access
the internet.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.117
To make this go away,

23:05.117 --> 23:08.054
we'd consider endangering
the welfare of a child.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.089
- He had unwanted sexual
contact with a minor.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.460
He has to go
on the registry.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.762
- Did Benson and Calhoun
prepare that sentence for you?

23:15.762 --> 23:17.630
We all know
what this was.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.298
A misunderstanding

23:19.298 --> 23:21.768
between two sexually
inexperienced teenagers.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.169
- One of whom
is 15 years old.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.671
That's automatic
sexual misconduct.

23:24.671 --> 23:25.838
- That's your best argument?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.474
There's a Romeo
and Juliet exemption.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.675
- Not if he forced her.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.610
- That's her story,
after the fact.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.978
- This train is leaving
the station.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.345
I've offered you
no prison time.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.081
If you say no
and your son is convicted,

23:35.081 --> 23:36.916
prison time is what
he could be looking at.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.184
- But he didn't do
anything wrong.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.086
- Chris,
is this what you want?

23:40.086 --> 23:41.153
To go to trial?

23:41.153 --> 23:42.822
- Does that mean
I'm on the news?

23:42.822 --> 23:44.156
Everybody knows
who I am?

23:44.156 --> 23:45.825
- Once you're arrested
and charged,

23:45.825 --> 23:47.594
your name is made public.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.362
Anytime anyone Googles you
for the rest of your life,

23:50.362 --> 23:52.331
this is what will come up.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.000
- Don't threaten my son.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.267
This girl's slandering him.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.303
We need to fight this.

23:57.303 --> 24:00.339
- Mr. Barba, what if I just say
sorry to Abby and her family?

24:00.339 --> 24:02.174
- You have nothing
to be sorry for.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.276
- No, absolutely not.
Let's go.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.346
- We're calling your bluff.

24:07.346 --> 24:09.215
No deal.

24:22.261 --> 24:22.895
- Chris Roberts,
you are charged

24:24.396 --> 24:25.765
with one count
of attempted rape

24:25.765 --> 24:27.399
and two counts
of sexual misconduct

24:27.399 --> 24:29.101
and forcible touching.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.436
How do you plead?

24:30.436 --> 24:32.304
- Not guilty on all counts,
Your Honor.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.773
- People on bail?

24:33.773 --> 24:35.642
- The defendant has a passport
and the means to flee.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.109
We request 1 million.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.311
- For an 18-year-old
high school honors student

24:39.311 --> 24:40.713
with no priors
who lives at home?

24:40.713 --> 24:43.550
In lieu of bail,
we ask that he be released

24:43.550 --> 24:45.151
into his parents' custody.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.385
- I'll split the difference.

24:46.385 --> 24:48.120
Bail is set at 500,000.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.122
The defendant will
surrender his passport.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.227
- Lieutenant.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.229
- Dodds, glad you made it.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.131
You know, it's helpful
for the victims

24:59.131 --> 25:00.132
to see us in the gallery.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.568
- Yeah, about this victim,

25:01.568 --> 25:03.970
I'm sorry I brought it up
in front of everybody.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.371
- Don't be.
It's not a problem.

25:05.371 --> 25:06.639
- It's just that
these two teenagers

25:06.639 --> 25:08.107
both seem like good kids.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.577
I don't think they know
what happened in that darkroom.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.844
Do we?

25:11.844 --> 25:13.312
- Look, he may not realize

25:13.312 --> 25:15.481
that what he did
was a sexual assault,

25:15.481 --> 25:16.983
but Abby didn't make this up.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.485
She's just not
a manipulative girl.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.420
- Yeah, okay,
but he's not a predator.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.422
This is a high school
make out session gone bad.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.591
They shouldn't be going
to trial.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.192
- I don't disagree
with you.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.259
Not our call.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.394
- It wasn't theirs either.

25:28.394 --> 25:30.029
This whole thing
is a runaway train.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.599
- Good morning.

25:35.434 --> 25:38.605
- Wow, they made Chris
look like Harry Potter.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.607
- Well, we've seen
that before, right?

25:40.607 --> 25:42.775
The nerd defense.

25:46.679 --> 25:49.015
- The night Abby came home
after being assaulted,

25:49.015 --> 25:50.617
the defendant texted her.

25:50.617 --> 25:52.619
"I had a great time tonight.
See you Monday."

25:52.619 --> 25:54.120
She wrote back, "K."

25:54.120 --> 25:58.224
A week later, while Mr. Roberts
was being interrogated by SVU,

25:58.224 --> 25:59.626
she texted him again.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.661
"I don't know why
this is happening.

26:01.661 --> 26:04.496
I like you.
I hope you're not mad at me."

26:04.496 --> 26:07.299
In your years
as an SVU detective,

26:07.299 --> 26:09.101
sergeant, and now lieutenant,

26:09.101 --> 26:11.270
have you ever seen
this kind of communication

26:11.270 --> 26:12.672
between a young victim
and an assailant?

26:12.672 --> 26:14.707
- Yes, it's more common
than not.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.443
Look, teenagers have
imperfect judgment.

26:17.443 --> 26:20.847
I mean, in my experience,
a young, naive girl

26:20.847 --> 26:23.683
who also attends the same
high school as her rapist

26:23.683 --> 26:26.285
would be scared
of causing conflict

26:26.285 --> 26:28.788
or, worse, being stigmatized
by her peers.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.389
- In your experience,
this would be true

26:30.389 --> 26:31.991
of someone like Abby?

26:31.991 --> 26:33.993
- Yes, girls like Abby
who are shy

26:33.993 --> 26:36.729
have trouble speaking up
for themselves,

26:36.729 --> 26:41.333
and teenaged predators often
prey on less-assertive victims.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.569
- Okay, so one last question.

26:43.569 --> 26:48.074
Abby didn't file a report

26:48.074 --> 26:50.710
with the police
immediately afterwards.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.378
How unusual is that?

26:52.378 --> 26:54.380
- Oh, it's not unusual.
At all.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.382
It happens with many,
many victims.

26:56.382 --> 26:57.984
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.752
- Good morning, Lieutenant.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.220
If I understood you
just now,

27:01.220 --> 27:04.090
it's because the assailant
is naive or shy

27:04.090 --> 27:07.426
that she waited four days
to disclose?

27:07.426 --> 27:08.761
- No, that's not
what I said.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.897
I said it's not unusual at all

27:10.897 --> 27:13.700
for any victim
to wait to disclose.

27:13.700 --> 27:17.303
Victims often need time to
process what happened to them

27:17.303 --> 27:19.405
before approaching police.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.307
- You mean before
approaching you.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.009
She went to her local
precinct first,

27:23.009 --> 27:25.712
and they chose not
to pursue an investigation.

27:25.712 --> 27:29.015
- Because local precincts
aren't properly trained

27:29.015 --> 27:30.850
in sexual assault.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.853
That's why the NYPD created
the Special Victims Unit

27:33.853 --> 27:35.722
in the first place.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.023
- Where apparently
you're trained to believe

27:37.023 --> 27:39.625
that victims with certain
personality flaws

27:39.625 --> 27:40.860
are more likely
to be targeted.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.762
- Also not what I said.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.732
- I know how difficult
it is to be professional

27:45.732 --> 27:47.599
and politically correct
at the same time,

27:47.599 --> 27:50.136
but you did just say
that a more assertive girl

27:50.136 --> 27:51.971
might not have been targeted.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.340
It sounds to me
like you're blaming the victim.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.742
- No, I am not.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.844
It's always
the rapist's fault.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.345
Again, twisting
what I'm saying.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.213
- So there is nothing
that the accuser can do

28:01.213 --> 28:03.916
that would contribute
to this situation?

28:03.916 --> 28:06.085
If she's sexy?

28:06.085 --> 28:08.921
Willingly going
to private areas?

28:08.921 --> 28:12.458
Enthusiastically engaging
in foreplay?

28:12.458 --> 28:14.761
None of this
could possibly lead on

28:14.761 --> 28:17.930
a young, inexperienced
teenaged boy?

28:17.930 --> 28:19.799
- Objection.
Speculation.

28:19.799 --> 28:23.202
- More like common sense,
Your Honor.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.105
But I'll withdraw.
Nothing further.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.877
- During the course
of our investigation,

28:30.877 --> 28:32.945
we became aware that
Chris Roberts was a member

28:32.945 --> 28:34.947
of the school's
unofficial secret society,

28:34.947 --> 28:36.448
the Cherry Pickers Club.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.584
- What did your investigation
find out about this club?

28:38.584 --> 28:42.621
- Club's one purpose,
to deflower female students,

28:42.621 --> 28:44.323
and then to record
the names of those conquests

28:44.323 --> 28:45.825
on a wall in the library

28:45.825 --> 28:47.393
behind a portrait
of the school's founder.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.961
- The defendant recorded
Abby's name on that wall?

28:48.961 --> 28:50.229
- Yes, he did.
- How many names

28:50.229 --> 28:51.798
had he recorded
before hers?

28:51.798 --> 28:52.899
- None.
- Were the other members

28:52.899 --> 28:54.801
of his club more
successful this year?

28:54.801 --> 28:56.102
- Well, they claimed to be.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.937
And while interviewing them,
it became clear

28:57.937 --> 28:59.939
that Chris was getting
taunted as a failure

28:59.939 --> 29:01.307
who needed to step up.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.842
- So by assaulting Abby

29:02.842 --> 29:04.877
and writing her name
beneath his,

29:04.877 --> 29:05.978
that meant
in the eyes of his peers

29:05.978 --> 29:07.179
that he was
no longer a loser?

29:07.179 --> 29:08.815
- Objection.
- Rephrase.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.516
Did he write
Abby's name on that wall

29:10.516 --> 29:13.352
as someone whose cherry
he had picked that night?

29:13.352 --> 29:14.821
- Yes.
- Did he subsequently brag

29:14.821 --> 29:16.655
on social media
that he had done so?

29:16.655 --> 29:17.857
- Yes, he did.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.391
- Thank you.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.727
- Detective, we heard
your lieutenant explain

29:21.727 --> 29:23.863
that teenagers
tend to have poor judgment.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.998
Have you ever heard
of teenaged boys

29:25.998 --> 29:28.700
bragging about
their sexual conquests

29:28.700 --> 29:31.003
even when no such exploits
took place?

29:31.003 --> 29:33.072
- Are you asking me
if your client's a liar?

29:33.072 --> 29:35.741
- I'm asking you
if he's a teenager

29:35.741 --> 29:38.377
who, as you said,
was being pressured

29:38.377 --> 29:40.312
to claim he'd scored?

29:45.584 --> 29:47.419
- Yes.
- Redirect.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.521
Detective Carisi,
let me ask you again.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.357
During your initial
interview with the accused,

29:51.357 --> 29:52.424
did he lie to you?

29:52.424 --> 29:53.759
- Yeah, he flat-out denied

29:53.759 --> 29:55.594
having any sexual contact
with Abby.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.930
It was only when we confronted
him with the DNA evidence

29:57.930 --> 30:00.766
of his semen on Abby's dress
that he admitted the truth.

30:00.766 --> 30:01.968
- Objection.
Prejudicial.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.602
My client has
always maintained

30:03.602 --> 30:06.605
that all contact
was mutual and consensual.

30:06.605 --> 30:07.907
- Sure, except when
he was lying about it.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.209
- Spare us the grandstanding,
gentlemen.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.978
The objection is overruled.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.780
Why don't you two calm down
and we will resume after lunch?

30:14.780 --> 30:16.382
- At which time we'll be
calling our next witness,

30:16.382 --> 30:17.783
Abby Stewart.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.991
- We said no makeup.
Remember, Abby?

30:24.991 --> 30:26.758
- But I'll look
like a little girl.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.060
- They're making him
look like a saint.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.795
You can't look
like a sinner.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.630
[door opens]

30:31.630 --> 30:33.665
- Mrs. Roberts,
would you give us a minute?

30:35.334 --> 30:37.503
- I'm just
washing my hands.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.339
Abby, did they tell you

30:40.339 --> 30:42.074
that Stanford requested

30:42.074 --> 30:44.110
Chris withdraw
his application?

30:44.110 --> 30:45.945
- This isn't the time.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.579
- Do you understand that you're
ruining my son's life?

30:47.579 --> 30:49.515
- Hey, you need
to stop talking.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.917
- A woman cop like you,

30:50.917 --> 30:52.751
you always take
the girl's side, don't you?

30:52.751 --> 30:54.253
- That's not
what's happening here.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.754
- Yeah, well,
I've seen it.

30:55.754 --> 30:57.523
The sweet little girl
becomes the victim,

30:57.523 --> 30:59.125
and then the boy
is made out to be a brute.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.360
- Oh--
- And do you know why that is?

31:11.971 --> 31:12.104
.

31:13.639 --> 31:13.839
- Abby.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.410
Abby?

31:18.410 --> 31:20.779
- Chris and I danced,
we made out,

31:20.779 --> 31:23.449
and then we went downstairs
to the darkroom.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.952
- And you agreed
to all that willingly?

31:25.952 --> 31:27.219
- Yes.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.955
We were kissing
when we got inside.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.556
- And you were okay
with that as well?

31:30.556 --> 31:32.959
- Yes.

31:32.959 --> 31:36.095
- Then what happened?

31:36.095 --> 31:38.864
- He got aggressive.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.467
He put his hands
under my dress,

31:41.467 --> 31:44.403
and then he put his finger
in my vagina.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.539
- Did you agree to that?

31:47.539 --> 31:49.375
- No.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.978
- Did you tell him
that you didn't agree to that?

31:51.978 --> 31:53.545
- Yes.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.547
I told him to slow down.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.984
I said I didn't want him
to touch me down there.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.451
- And did that stop him?

31:59.451 --> 32:02.021
- No, he pushed up
against me

32:02.021 --> 32:05.191
and tried to put
his penis inside me.

32:06.625 --> 32:09.028
I said no again,

32:09.028 --> 32:11.230
but he kept
rubbing up against me.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.732
He...

32:13.732 --> 32:15.767
he came on my dress.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.772
- Was that something
you wanted?

32:20.772 --> 32:22.474
- No.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.710
He was hurting me.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.678
I'd never had sex
with anyone before,

32:26.678 --> 32:29.548
but I knew that was not
how I wanted it to be.

32:29.548 --> 32:33.219
- You didn't tell anyone
about it that night.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.921
You even--you texted
the defendant.

32:37.123 --> 32:40.292
- I was...humiliated.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.529
Too afraid to tell anyone.

32:43.529 --> 32:47.233
I eventually told
my mom the truth.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.900
We went to the police,

32:48.900 --> 32:52.704
and I told them
I'd been raped.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.741
- Abby, thank you.

33:02.114 --> 33:06.152
- Uh, I'm sorry you had
a regrettable experience, Abby.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.654
Is it all right
if I call you Abby?

33:08.654 --> 33:11.390
- Yeah, sure.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.059
- Let's you and I

33:13.059 --> 33:16.795
try and figure this out
together, Abby.

33:16.795 --> 33:20.666
Starting from the beginning.

33:20.666 --> 33:24.070
Is it fair to say that you had
a crush on Chris Roberts?

33:24.070 --> 33:27.073
- I guess.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.841
- Were you flattered
when he texted you?

33:29.841 --> 33:31.510
- Kind of, but--

33:31.510 --> 33:33.845
- I'm not saying
it was love and marriage.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.114
Must be a nice guy.

33:35.114 --> 33:38.150
Why else would you go
to the darkroom with him?

33:38.150 --> 33:39.918
- I thought he was nice.

33:39.918 --> 33:42.454
- Were you aware of
the darkroom's reputation?

33:42.454 --> 33:43.922
- Objection.
Relevance.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.791
- It goes to her
state of mind, Your Honor.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.659
- I'll allow it.
- At the very least,

33:47.659 --> 33:49.495
you probably knew
you weren't going there

33:49.495 --> 33:51.163
to develop photographs.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.465
- I thought we were
just going to kiss.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.934
- You mean like this?

33:55.934 --> 33:57.769
Defense exhibits
6A through D, Your Honor.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.105
Now, I know Mr. Barba

33:59.105 --> 34:00.772
already asked you
about these photos,

34:00.772 --> 34:03.675
but it appears as if
you were enjoying yourself.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.777
No need to be ashamed.
I have a daughter too.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.013
I know how much she likes
going to the dances.

34:08.013 --> 34:09.348
- Your Honor,
is there a question here?

34:09.348 --> 34:10.916
- There is.

34:10.916 --> 34:13.919
Now, this was your first
real date, wasn't it, Abby?

34:13.919 --> 34:14.920
- Yes.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.788
- You really wanted him
to like you.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.857
Maybe you were
a little nervous.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.192
- Sort of, a little.

34:20.192 --> 34:23.462
- Sure you were.
Alone with a boy you liked.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.197
It was dark too.

34:25.197 --> 34:28.134
And maybe it was loud too,
I'm assuming,

34:28.134 --> 34:29.568
what with all the music.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.969
- Yeah, it was.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.771
- So there was
a lot going on.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.274
So is it possible
that you got overwhelmed

34:35.274 --> 34:38.144
and were unsure about
what you really wanted,

34:38.144 --> 34:41.280
and that's why
you never said no?

34:41.280 --> 34:43.149
- I didn't exactly say no,

34:43.149 --> 34:47.453
but I told him
not to go down...there.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.555
- Down there?
Where?

34:49.555 --> 34:50.722
On the floor?

34:50.722 --> 34:52.158
- That's not what I meant.

34:52.158 --> 34:53.325
I wasn't into it.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.961
- Into what exactly?

34:55.961 --> 34:57.296
- Sex.

34:57.296 --> 35:00.166
- You said the word "sex"?

35:00.166 --> 35:01.467
- No.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.535
I meant I wasn't into
having sex.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.804
He knew that.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.973
- But how could he know that?

35:07.973 --> 35:09.408
Chris was nervous too.

35:09.408 --> 35:13.179
He was in a loud, dark room,
the same as you.

35:13.179 --> 35:15.013
Did you think
he could read your mind?

35:15.013 --> 35:17.015
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

35:17.015 --> 35:19.818
You were texting
and talking in school.

35:19.818 --> 35:22.254
You didn't even think
you'd been raped for four days.

35:22.254 --> 35:25.357
He had no idea that you'd
had a bad evening

35:25.357 --> 35:27.359
until the police arrived
at his door.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.560
- Your Honor, objection.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.095
- Ask a question,
Mr. Buchanan.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.697
- Well, I'm just trying
to understand,

35:31.697 --> 35:35.066
as I'm sure
Chris and the jury are,

35:35.066 --> 35:38.237
how did we get here?

35:38.237 --> 35:41.673
- I knew I didn't want
to have that happen to me.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.209
- But did Chris know?

35:43.209 --> 35:44.510
- I think he did.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.945
- You think?
You think you were raped.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.914
You think you told him
to stop.

35:48.914 --> 35:53.519
Isn't it possible that you
went completely along with this

35:53.519 --> 35:55.221
and then regretted it later?

35:55.221 --> 35:56.288
- Objection.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.390
- Withdrawn.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.393
[tense music]

36:01.393 --> 36:09.668
*

36:11.237 --> 36:13.372
Nothing further.

36:13.372 --> 36:21.413
*

36:28.287 --> 36:30.289
- I don't know
what just happened.

36:30.289 --> 36:31.657
- It wasn't your fault,
honey.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.525
- Let's go.
- Testifying is never easy.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.294
- You could have
protected her more.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.895
- Abby, the worst is over.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.497
- No, it's not.

36:38.497 --> 36:39.865
Chris is going to testify

36:39.865 --> 36:42.268
and tell everyone
lies about me.

36:51.277 --> 36:51.377
.

36:52.378 --> 36:53.078
- We were
in the darkroom kissing.

36:55.146 --> 36:57.883
I kept asking if everything
I was doing was okay,

36:57.883 --> 37:01.320
and she didn't say no,
so I kept going.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.422
- How far did you go?

37:03.422 --> 37:05.624
- I put my fingers
inside her.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.326
I couldn't have done
anything else

37:07.326 --> 37:08.894
even if we both
wanted to,

37:08.894 --> 37:11.730
because I finished early.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.532
- Did you have sex
with Abby Stewart?

37:13.532 --> 37:15.634
- No, I did not.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.304
- When you got home
that night,

37:18.304 --> 37:20.472
how did you feel
the evening had gone?

37:20.472 --> 37:21.540
- Good.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.008
I didn't think
anything was wrong.

37:23.008 --> 37:25.176
I texted her.
She texted me back.

37:25.176 --> 37:28.647
- So it sounds like she was
sending you mixed messages.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.349
- If she was upset,
I couldn't tell.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.651
- Now, Chris,
there were two instances

37:32.651 --> 37:35.321
where you admit
that you had lied.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.488
What was the first?

37:36.488 --> 37:37.856
- To the police.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.458
When I said
we hadn't touched,

37:39.458 --> 37:41.327
we had touched
under our clothes,

37:41.327 --> 37:43.228
but we didn't have sex.

37:43.228 --> 37:44.430
- And the second?

37:44.430 --> 37:46.064
- To my friends.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.166
I told them
I'd had sex with Abby

37:48.166 --> 37:50.802
because of the pressure
to get a name on the wall,

37:50.802 --> 37:52.338
but it wasn't true.

37:56.575 --> 37:59.010
The club is
disrespectful to girls.

37:59.010 --> 38:02.147
Me playing into that
was stupid.

38:02.147 --> 38:04.149
I was afraid
of being ridiculed.

38:04.149 --> 38:06.652
- By volunteering your
testimony here today,

38:06.652 --> 38:08.454
you're risking just that.

38:08.454 --> 38:11.089
- I know,
but I owe it to my family

38:11.089 --> 38:12.924
to explain my behavior,

38:12.924 --> 38:16.795
and I owe it
to Abby's family too.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.130
If I upset her, I'm sorry.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.668
I wish things
had gone differently.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.604
I know now that mixing
dating and alcohol

38:25.604 --> 38:27.606
is a recipe for disaster

38:27.606 --> 38:31.109
and that clear communication
is very important.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.978
- Thank you.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.279
I admire your courage

38:34.279 --> 38:39.084
for testifying so frankly
here today.

38:39.084 --> 38:43.422
- You lied to the police

38:43.422 --> 38:45.457
and to your friends.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.626
Is that your story?

38:47.626 --> 38:49.294
- Yes.
I'm not proud of it.

38:49.294 --> 38:51.262
- You did so because
your friends were taunting you

38:51.262 --> 38:53.298
that you hadn't scored?

38:53.298 --> 38:54.666
- I wouldn't put it
that way.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.101
- You'd call it
making love?

38:56.101 --> 38:57.603
Or cherry picking?

38:57.603 --> 38:59.170
- Objection.
- It's the name of the club.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.806
- Overruled.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.173
- Doesn't matter
what I'd call it.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.175
I didn't do anything
Abby didn't want.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.177
- So she went to the police,
testified on the stand,

39:06.177 --> 39:08.213
was publicly humiliated
and ostracized by her friends

39:08.213 --> 39:10.015
for something
that she made up?

39:10.015 --> 39:12.283
- No, she probably thinks
she was raped.

39:12.283 --> 39:13.885
- Well, what does
that tell you?

39:13.885 --> 39:16.254
- That she thinks that now,
but she did want it at the time.

39:16.254 --> 39:17.723
- How can you be sure
of what she was thinking

39:17.723 --> 39:18.790
or what she wanted?

39:18.790 --> 39:20.291
- Objection.
Badgering.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.528
- Witness will answer.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.095
- I don't know
if I can be sure,

39:24.095 --> 39:25.597
but she didn't say no.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.699
- She didn't say it
or you didn't hear it?

39:27.699 --> 39:29.435
- I don't know.
- Did you ever ask her?

39:29.435 --> 39:31.703
- No.
- Did you ever hear a yes?

39:31.703 --> 39:33.672
No, because you weren't
listening to her at all,

39:33.672 --> 39:34.840
were you?

39:34.840 --> 39:36.074
Your only concern was
getting what you wanted,

39:36.074 --> 39:37.843
scoring, making it up
onto that wall.

39:37.843 --> 39:41.447
Well, congratulations,
you made it.

39:48.787 --> 39:51.490
Nothing further.

39:51.490 --> 39:54.493
[tense music]

39:54.493 --> 40:02.534
*

40:05.471 --> 40:07.405
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.442
- I just wanted
to thank you.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.177
That was a good cross.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.746
You know, no matter
what the jury decides,

40:14.746 --> 40:16.482
you did your job.

40:16.482 --> 40:18.316
- Did I?

40:18.316 --> 40:20.085
It was always
a murky case.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.321
- Exactly the kind
that we need to be fighting.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.223
The world is changing.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.358
We need new rules.

40:27.358 --> 40:28.860
- Rules of sexual engagement
for teenagers?

40:28.860 --> 40:30.128
- Yes.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.364
California just passed
affirmative consent.

40:33.364 --> 40:35.033
- We'll see how that goes.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.268
- Well, something
needs to change.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.237
The problem is
is that teenage boys

40:39.237 --> 40:41.072
even in college
don't know what behavior

40:41.072 --> 40:43.008
might constitute rape.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.010
We need to make
the lines clearer.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.411
[knock at door]

40:46.411 --> 40:47.946
- Jury's in.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.716
- Here we go.

40:53.251 --> 40:56.421
- Members of the jury,
have you reached your verdict?

40:56.421 --> 40:57.889
- We have, Your Honor.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.858
- On the felony count
of attempted rape,

40:59.858 --> 41:01.426
how do you find?

41:01.426 --> 41:04.530
- We find the defendant,
Chris Roberts,

41:04.530 --> 41:06.532
not guilty.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.767
- On the misdemeanor count
of forcible touching,

41:08.767 --> 41:10.536
how do you find?

41:10.536 --> 41:13.104
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.373
- On the misdemeanor count
of sexual misconduct

41:15.373 --> 41:18.043
in the first degree,
how do you find?

41:18.043 --> 41:19.545
- Guilty.

41:19.545 --> 41:20.779
[crowd murmurs]
- What?

41:20.779 --> 41:22.548
- Members of the jury,

41:22.548 --> 41:24.182
the court thanks you
for your service.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.184
You are free to go.

41:26.184 --> 41:28.620
[bangs gavel]

41:28.620 --> 41:30.021
- I hope you're happy.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.156
Look what you did
to my son.

41:31.156 --> 41:32.558
- Abby.
- Chris.

41:32.558 --> 41:34.392
- Don't you talk to her.
Don't you even look at her!

41:34.392 --> 41:35.561
- I'm sorry.

41:35.561 --> 41:36.962
- Now you're sorry?

41:36.962 --> 41:38.196
- Don't you apologize
to him, sweetie.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.464
- Now is not the time.

41:39.464 --> 41:40.732
- Abby, you have nothing
to apologize for.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.067
- You can't tell me
that she didn't know

41:42.067 --> 41:44.369
what was gonna happen
when she went into that room.

41:44.369 --> 41:46.404
- You all can lie to yourselves
all you want!

41:46.404 --> 41:48.206
We know exactly
what your son is!

41:48.206 --> 41:50.208
And now he's on the registry,
and everyone will know!

41:50.208 --> 41:52.578
- We know what your daughter is!
- Enough! Enough!

41:52.578 --> 41:54.245
Enough! Enough!

41:54.245 --> 41:57.248
[gentle music]

41:57.248 --> 42:01.252
*

42:01.252 --> 42:03.622
- Chris.

42:03.622 --> 42:05.624
- Abby, let's go.

42:05.624 --> 42:13.665
*
