Crane: Previously on <i>Sleepy Hollow</i>...

00:02.320 --> 00:04.493
Abbie: So, you could see me
just by touching the symbol?

00:04.494 --> 00:07.132
If the symbol works with
the tablet of witnesses...

00:07.133 --> 00:08.855
It could be a tool for our cause.

00:08.856 --> 00:11.725
That's part of Pandora's box.
If she somehow manages

00:11.726 --> 00:13.326
<i>to collect the pieces
and put it back together...</i>

00:13.327 --> 00:15.529
JOE: <i>She and the Hidden One
are gonna be back in business.</i>

00:15.530 --> 00:16.563
(screaming)

00:16.564 --> 00:18.031
- (growls)
- (screams)

00:18.032 --> 00:19.323
The Wendigo is still inside me.

00:19.324 --> 00:20.934
- You could get hurt.
- Hey, no, no, no...

00:20.935 --> 00:22.002
that is not gonna happen.

00:22.003 --> 00:22.981
HIDDEN ONE: They dare to lay

00:22.982 --> 00:23.878
a hand upon you?

00:23.879 --> 00:26.338
I must do what should have
been done long ago.

00:26.339 --> 00:29.575
I must destroy the Witnesses.

00:30.644 --> 00:33.746

(solo continuing)

01:01.041 --> 01:02.741
(stops playing)

01:03.643 --> 01:04.843
We talked about this, Kyle.

01:04.845 --> 01:06.312
If you want to shred,

01:06.313 --> 01:07.379
you're in the wrong band.

01:07.380 --> 01:08.447
Post-punk indie rock

01:08.448 --> 01:09.782
is what we all agreed on.

01:09.783 --> 01:11.016
Screw it!

01:11.017 --> 01:12.451
I have kettle bell class in the a.m.

01:12.452 --> 01:13.886
Can we just have one practice

01:13.887 --> 01:15.521
where you don't quit the band, Kyle?

01:15.522 --> 01:16.522
Yeah, man.

01:16.523 --> 01:19.258
Let's do this.

01:23.897 --> 01:26.365
One, two, three, four...

01:26.366 --> 01:29.501
(music starts, then fades)

01:48.221 --> 01:53.092
(shrieking)

02:07.274 --> 02:08.741
You know...

02:08.741 --> 02:10.175
we got latex gloves in the top drawer.

02:10.176 --> 02:12.178
Oh, y-yes...

02:12.179 --> 02:14.113
I've been testing different
protective materials

02:14.114 --> 02:15.181
against this artifact.

02:15.182 --> 02:16.782
So far, leather, rubber,

02:16.783 --> 02:20.085
and... whatever these
tufted mittens are made of,

02:20.086 --> 02:23.355
seem to protect against
its remote viewing powers.

02:23.356 --> 02:25.758
So, direct skin contact is the key?

02:25.759 --> 02:27.560
- Seemingly.
- Mm!

02:30.464 --> 02:34.200
I did ask for a bear claw
and an almond beignet.

02:34.201 --> 02:35.534
I was quite specific.

02:35.535 --> 02:37.555
Mm, you don't know what's in the bag.

02:41.775 --> 02:42.775
You know what's in the bag.

02:42.776 --> 02:44.310
I...

02:44.311 --> 02:45.945
You promised me that
you would not use that thing

02:45.946 --> 02:47.413
to spy on me, Crane. Lieutenant,

02:47.414 --> 02:50.049
I-I have yet to master
how this artifact works.

02:50.050 --> 02:51.984
Now, in attempting to do so,

02:51.985 --> 02:54.887
I may have inadvertently watched you

02:54.888 --> 02:57.089
purchase me a Summertime
Squash Bran Muffin.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.224
Is that all that you saw?

02:58.225 --> 02:59.692
Yes!

03:00.827 --> 03:02.294
Lieutenant, you have
my most solemn vow.

03:02.295 --> 03:03.729
This is a crime

03:03.730 --> 03:05.564
against pastries, nothing more.

03:05.565 --> 03:06.832
Do not get weird on me, Crane.

03:06.833 --> 03:08.300
Uh...

03:08.301 --> 03:10.002
Even a tiny lie of the donut variety...

03:10.003 --> 03:11.170
(phone rings)

03:11.171 --> 03:13.311
...can erode the trust
between two people.

03:16.610 --> 03:17.776
What's up, Agent Foster?

03:17.777 --> 03:19.078
Mills...

03:19.079 --> 03:21.280
I'm at a crime scene in Tarrytown.

03:21.281 --> 03:23.616
There's something you need to see...

03:23.617 --> 03:24.750
at the office.

03:24.751 --> 03:25.918
Be there in 20.

03:25.919 --> 03:27.820
Crime scene.

03:27.821 --> 03:29.421
Foster thinks there's
something hinky about it,

03:29.422 --> 03:30.923
so I'm gonna go meet her.

03:37.597 --> 03:38.764
Multi-grain croissant.

03:39.599 --> 03:41.167
Truce?

03:41.168 --> 03:43.702
More like a tactical interdiction.

03:48.108 --> 03:49.575
Hmm-mm-mm...

03:50.844 --> 03:51.944
Oh, actually, that's very...

03:51.945 --> 03:53.045
(door shuts)

03:54.614 --> 03:55.848
SOPHIE: Wife comes back from yoga,

03:55.849 --> 03:57.683
finds them.

03:57.684 --> 04:00.553
The drummer's Bureau,
worked cyber out of our office.

04:00.554 --> 04:02.555
Yeah, I scanned the report.

04:02.556 --> 04:05.291
Ruptured a ear drum,
leading to cerebral hemorrhage.

04:08.128 --> 04:09.795
They couldn't have
turned it up that loud.

04:09.796 --> 04:11.030
Exactly.

04:11.031 --> 04:13.465
I pulled this before ERT could.

04:15.302 --> 04:17.469
You are getting good at this.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.738
Yeah, I'm really digging
obstructing evidence.

04:19.738 --> 04:23.342
All right, there's a lot of
interference at the end but...

04:23.343 --> 04:24.844
something...

04:24.845 --> 04:26.945
was here.

04:28.515 --> 04:31.250
(shrieking, then static)

04:32.252 --> 04:33.786
We have ourselves an entity.

04:35.388 --> 04:36.822
Kind of an all-encompassing word for:

04:36.823 --> 04:39.403
"We do not know what the hell
we're dealing with yet."

04:41.328 --> 04:43.495
See this bow in the wall?

04:43.496 --> 04:45.998
There are reports, in the 1920's,

04:45.999 --> 04:47.533
about séances where

04:47.534 --> 04:49.502
wood, metal, even glass would buckle.

04:49.503 --> 04:50.836
Hyde Sisters.

04:51.838 --> 04:52.938
Right?

04:52.939 --> 04:54.173
Yes, very good, Agent Foster.

04:54.174 --> 04:55.341
I'll gonna circle back with Crane,

04:55.342 --> 04:56.575
see if he has any insights.

04:56.576 --> 04:57.610
I'll loop in Joe and Jenny,

04:57.611 --> 04:58.744
and we'll clean up the image,

04:58.745 --> 05:00.245
figure out what we're dealing with.

05:00.614 --> 05:01.780
Thanks.

05:05.585 --> 05:06.546
(door opening)

05:06.547 --> 05:08.387
If you come not
bearing cruller, Lieutenant,

05:08.388 --> 05:09.822
do not bother coming...

05:16.296 --> 05:17.763
HIDDEN ONE: Your time has come, mortal.

05:17.764 --> 05:19.598
You and the ones

05:19.599 --> 05:24.236
you lead have dared to lay
a hand upon my consort.

05:24.871 --> 05:26.438
(gasps)

05:26.439 --> 05:28.741
- (growls)
- (screams)

05:28.742 --> 05:31.310
You have all forgotten your place...

05:34.147 --> 05:35.214
...and for that,

05:35.215 --> 05:37.616
you <i> will</i> pay the ultimate price.

05:37.617 --> 05:39.218
Where is the other Witness?

05:45.091 --> 05:46.825
If you tell me...

05:48.762 --> 05:50.396
...I will make your deaths painless.

05:50.397 --> 05:52.364
(grunting)

05:53.967 --> 05:54.967
(glass shattering)

05:54.968 --> 05:56.068
(gasping)

06:00.106 --> 06:02.326
- (sizzling)
- CRANE: Aah!

06:04.477 --> 06:05.978
Very well.

06:05.979 --> 06:08.414
I will kill you first...

06:09.983 --> 06:11.963
...and then I'll find her myself.

06:12.986 --> 06:14.286
You should know...

06:15.322 --> 06:17.056
...I've died before.

06:18.792 --> 06:21.193
I do not fear dying again.

06:21.194 --> 06:24.129
Know that her death will be slow...

06:24.130 --> 06:26.699
and excruciating.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.360
(whispering): No.

06:36.610 --> 06:38.544
HIDDEN ONE: Thura.

06:51.825 --> 06:54.460
(grunts, gasps)

06:55.795 --> 06:57.563
Crane?

06:58.465 --> 06:59.631
Crane?!

07:00.900 --> 07:02.801
Crane, can you hear me?

07:05.205 --> 07:06.338
Crane...

07:06.339 --> 07:07.840
I don't know what's going on,

07:07.841 --> 07:09.208
but I just got electrified
by the front door.

07:09.209 --> 07:10.409
Are you still in there?

07:10.410 --> 07:12.945
Call me, call me, please, call me.

07:19.919 --> 07:21.487
What have you done with Crane?

07:21.488 --> 07:23.222
I have not done anything.

07:23.223 --> 07:24.523
No?

07:24.524 --> 07:27.092
Then why is my front door

07:27.093 --> 07:29.862
now an electrified fence?

07:29.863 --> 07:31.263
That fence...

07:31.264 --> 07:33.232
is an impenetrable barrier

07:33.233 --> 07:36.068
designed to contain the power of a god.

07:36.069 --> 07:37.436
So your crazy boyfriend did this.

07:37.437 --> 07:40.406
Please lower that
ineffectual weapon, Witness.

07:40.407 --> 07:42.041
I am not in the mood.

07:43.576 --> 07:45.177
I will not ask again.

07:48.949 --> 07:52.484
The Emblem of Thura...
has been activated.

07:55.922 --> 07:57.823
For the first time in...

07:59.559 --> 08:01.827
...4,000 years.

08:06.099 --> 08:07.766
The Emblem of Thura.

08:07.767 --> 08:11.270
It was created to imprison gods.

08:11.271 --> 08:14.673
It feeds on the power
of the being it has imprisoned.

08:16.409 --> 08:18.777
The more he fights...
and he will fight...

08:18.778 --> 08:20.798
the closer he brings us all to death.

08:21.648 --> 08:23.449
He has let his anger rule him again.

08:23.450 --> 08:26.085
And he's in there with Crane.

08:26.086 --> 08:28.254
And he will not let
himself be imprisoned.

08:28.255 --> 08:30.255
Not ever again.

08:30.256 --> 08:33.225
As he throws his might
against the barrier,

08:33.226 --> 08:35.126
the power will build,

08:35.128 --> 08:38.797
culminating in a maelstrom
of fire and destruction.

08:38.798 --> 08:41.799
There must be
some way to calm him down.

08:41.801 --> 08:43.936
That would be me.

air ducts are all sealed off

Barrier of mystic energy.

Nothing can penetrate it.

We'll all die much sooner than that.

09:34.558 --> 09:37.293
You keep saying that.

09:37.294 --> 09:40.796
The Emblem of Thura is less
stable here in the mortal world

09:40.797 --> 09:42.431
than in the Catacombs.

09:42.432 --> 09:44.567
You're not gonna leave him
in there, are you?

09:44.568 --> 09:45.601
That's why you're here.

09:45.602 --> 09:47.736
You broke him out before.

09:47.737 --> 09:50.239
When I last released him,
my Box was intact

09:50.240 --> 09:51.907
and my powers were at their peak.

09:51.908 --> 09:53.309
And now your Box is broken.

09:53.310 --> 09:55.277
So...

09:58.482 --> 10:00.282
we...

10:01.485 --> 10:02.751

What overloaded the Mic?

10:10.827 --> 10:12.028
I don't know.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.462
I tried to isolate

10:13.463 --> 10:15.197
every bandwidth and
frequency on the recording.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.532
There is just no sound.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.600
Not until the very end.

10:17.601 --> 10:18.601
Play it back.

10:18.602 --> 10:19.769
Slow it down.

10:19.770 --> 10:23.706
(slowed shriek, interrupted by static)

10:24.541 --> 10:25.541
That is not feedback.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.709
Not even close.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.534
(sighs) I'm an idiot.

10:29.946 --> 10:31.480
That's a wail.

10:31.481 --> 10:33.716
The kind that kills.

10:35.118 --> 10:36.652
I know what did this.

10:36.653 --> 10:38.054
A banshee?

10:38.055 --> 10:39.789
Is that the screeching
bird woman thing?

10:39.790 --> 10:40.790
JENNY: That's a harpy.

10:40.791 --> 10:42.124
This is a banshee, as in

10:42.125 --> 10:44.026
Woman of the Barrows, omen of death,

10:44.027 --> 10:45.461
messenger from another world.

10:45.462 --> 10:46.862
But she's nothing compared

10:46.863 --> 10:48.864
to that demon you have on your end.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.700
Please tell me that
you're not actually thinking

10:51.701 --> 10:52.968
of working with Pandora.

10:52.969 --> 10:54.970
I have got it under control.

10:56.973 --> 10:57.973
Do not touch that.

10:57.974 --> 10:59.208
It's not what you think it is.

10:59.209 --> 11:01.177
JENNY: Okay, aside from the fact

11:01.178 --> 11:04.680
that she and her crazy god
husband want to end humanity,

11:04.681 --> 11:06.715
you didn't see the look
in her eyes when she tried

11:06.716 --> 11:09.085
to kill us to get
that piece of her Box back.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.386
If Joe hadn't Wendigo-ed out,

11:10.387 --> 11:11.387
we'd be nothing more than

11:11.388 --> 11:13.089
greasy stains on the floor right now.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.058
I know the timing is funky,
but we need to save Crane,

11:16.059 --> 11:17.827
and she's the only one who has any idea

11:17.828 --> 11:19.206
how to break through this barrier.

11:19.443 --> 11:21.063
So, you handle the banshee,

11:21.064 --> 11:22.598
I will handle Pandora...

11:22.599 --> 11:24.300
I'll check in soon.

11:27.337 --> 11:29.672
Anything in there useful?

11:29.673 --> 11:32.508
None of these items
can assist us in our task,

11:32.509 --> 11:34.243
but this banshee is promising.

11:34.244 --> 11:35.694
The one that just killed three men?

11:35.878 --> 11:37.213
The one that's alive.

11:37.214 --> 11:41.217
My Box is best powered
by living, breathing creatures

11:41.218 --> 11:44.720
from realms beyond this mortal sphere.

11:45.589 --> 11:46.589
(quiet scoff)

11:46.590 --> 11:48.691
So, theoretically,

11:48.692 --> 11:50.960
what would you do with this banshee?

11:57.801 --> 12:00.236
(Hidden One grunting in distance)

12:02.606 --> 12:03.706
(quietly): Oh, no.

12:03.707 --> 12:05.174
(sighs)

12:06.944 --> 12:08.344
(grunts with effort)

12:12.049 --> 12:13.516
What are you doing?!

12:14.618 --> 12:16.152
Stop!

12:17.254 --> 12:19.155
Stop, stop, please, please.

12:23.126 --> 12:24.493
You are more

12:24.494 --> 12:26.729
resourceful than I gave
you credit for, human,

12:26.730 --> 12:29.298
but I escaped this prison once
and I will again.

12:29.299 --> 12:30.633
Please...

12:30.634 --> 12:32.068
I have no idea what is happening.

12:32.069 --> 12:34.270
The Emblem of Thura,

12:34.271 --> 12:35.671
triggered by my power,

12:35.672 --> 12:38.040
creates this barrier that surrounds us.

12:39.276 --> 12:41.677
It has a name.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.253
The Emblem of Thura.

12:51.254 --> 12:53.022
I knew this was important,

12:53.023 --> 12:54.423
but this is...

12:54.424 --> 12:55.658
extraordinary.

12:55.659 --> 12:57.593
Extraordinary?

12:57.594 --> 12:59.195
That Emblem imprisons us, you fool.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.296
Ah, ah, ah!

13:01.632 --> 13:03.599
I think I understand the rules.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.202
This Emblem's more powerful
than you, isn't it?

13:06.203 --> 13:10.139
And I thought today
would bear no fruit.

13:10.140 --> 13:11.707
Enjoy this fleeting moment,

13:11.708 --> 13:15.111
but I will escape this trap,
at all costs,

13:15.112 --> 13:16.579
including your life.

13:18.882 --> 13:22.485
You don't understand the barest
fraction of what you hold.

13:23.687 --> 13:25.955

13:38.335 --> 13:39.902
So who's this guy, again?

13:39.903 --> 13:42.138
JENNY: Ex-Belfast gunman and smuggler

13:42.139 --> 13:45.541
turned bon vivant brewmaster,
whisky blogger.

13:45.542 --> 13:47.977
There he is.

13:47.978 --> 13:49.078
Connor!

13:50.080 --> 13:51.147
Oi, oi.

13:51.148 --> 13:52.281
All right, yeah.

13:52.282 --> 13:54.984

13:56.520 --> 13:58.020

14:08.932 --> 14:10.599
Oh, it's fresh.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.201
Heaven sent from a goddess.

14:14.037 --> 14:16.057
What can I do for you, Jen, my dear?

14:17.007 --> 14:21.410
Hypothetically, if I had a banshee...

14:21.411 --> 14:25.448
situation... how might I deal with it?

14:27.250 --> 14:29.952
I'd run... like the only bottle

14:29.953 --> 14:33.422
of 75-year-old single malt
whiskey you had were on fire.

14:33.423 --> 14:34.457
That's not an option.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.591
We need to...

14:35.592 --> 14:37.693
get our house in order.

14:40.030 --> 14:41.764
Hypothetically...

14:41.765 --> 14:43.966
you could put your house to right

14:43.967 --> 14:46.202
with pure iron.

14:46.203 --> 14:47.904
Only the good stuff, mind.

14:47.905 --> 14:49.805
Nothing younger than 200 years or so.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.774
But it'll use your own noise

14:51.775 --> 14:53.276
against you now, so you must

14:53.277 --> 14:54.644
be careful.

14:54.645 --> 14:57.213
Traffic, talking, children playing...

14:57.214 --> 14:59.382
it'll suck up the sounds of life

14:59.383 --> 15:01.884
and spit them out as destruction.

15:01.885 --> 15:03.786
Wiped out half of County Clare

15:03.787 --> 15:06.956
back in the 17th century,
or so legend tells.

15:06.957 --> 15:09.158
You know how to get
its attention, right?

15:09.159 --> 15:10.626
Make one hell of a racket?

15:10.627 --> 15:15.164
Oh, aye, that will piss it right off.

15:17.234 --> 15:19.502
(siren wails)

15:22.339 --> 15:24.640
Isn't it bad luck to
steal from a graveyard?

15:24.641 --> 15:26.642
JENNY: We borrowed a fence

15:26.643 --> 15:28.244
from the 1700's, not a corpse.

15:28.245 --> 15:30.479
Based on advice from a
drunk whiskey blogger.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.847
What could possibly go wrong?

15:31.848 --> 15:33.683
It'll work.

15:33.684 --> 15:36.065
The guy eats blood sausage
for breakfast, but whatever.

15:36.620 --> 15:38.421
Everything okay with him?

15:38.422 --> 15:40.356
Yeah, he's fine. Why?

15:40.357 --> 15:42.258
I heard about what happened with him,

15:42.259 --> 15:44.160
turning into the Wendigo.

15:44.161 --> 15:45.361
Started to turn.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.429
We stopped it.

15:46.430 --> 15:47.797
It's just...

15:47.798 --> 15:49.131
it must have been hard for him

15:49.132 --> 15:50.299
you know, finding out

15:50.300 --> 15:51.968
that thing is inside of him.

15:51.969 --> 15:54.337
We talked about it.

15:54.338 --> 15:58.441
I told him I know he's in
control and I trust him.

15:58.442 --> 15:59.875
He's good.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.177
Is he?

16:01.178 --> 16:02.945
'Cause, I mean, a guy who is in love

16:02.946 --> 16:04.380
will say anything to make you happy,

16:04.381 --> 16:07.183
and trust me, that dude is in love.

16:07.184 --> 16:08.184
FBI profiling?

16:08.185 --> 16:09.719
Just a lot of...

16:09.720 --> 16:12.021
tragic relationships.

16:12.022 --> 16:13.155
(both chuckle)

16:13.156 --> 16:15.336
For the record,
I never profile my friends.

16:16.460 --> 16:18.294
And as far as this Wendigo thing...

16:18.295 --> 16:19.595

16:21.331 --> 16:22.431

17:23.752 --> 17:25.319
Hah.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.490

17:29.543 --> 17:31.169
Okay, we need to call your sister...

17:31.170 --> 17:32.579
because that...

17:32.580 --> 17:34.247
did not go well.

17:34.248 --> 17:35.415
This is crazy!

17:35.416 --> 17:36.950
Give Pandora the banshee?

17:36.951 --> 17:38.485
She's conning you.

17:38.486 --> 17:40.119
She doesn't care about anything

17:40.120 --> 17:42.322
except getting more pieces
of her Box back.

17:46.727 --> 17:49.562
Look, I don't like this either,
but we do not have a choice.

17:49.563 --> 17:51.965
We need the banshee alive...

17:51.966 --> 17:53.866
for Crane.

17:56.770 --> 17:59.806
You believe you'll find
solutions in these texts?

17:59.807 --> 18:02.387
These tomes have not let me down yet.

18:04.912 --> 18:06.579

18:06.580 --> 18:08.014

18:08.015 --> 18:09.015
Then you deny yourself

18:09.016 --> 18:12.352
the glorious gift of discovery.

18:12.353 --> 18:14.420
Useless pablum to

18:41.048 --> 18:44.517

Bob Dylan and Nina Simone,

18:44.518 --> 18:46.719

18:46.720 --> 18:49.689

The works of Austen, Dostoyevsky,

18:52.493 --> 18:54.794
Morrison, Ta-Nehisi Coates...

18:54.795 --> 18:58.565

18:59.900 --> 19:03.069
The fearless lens of Diane Arbus,

19:03.070 --> 19:07.540
and the sublime squiggle
of Charles M. Schulz.

19:07.541 --> 19:09.142
What you call pablum

19:09.143 --> 19:10.877
is, in fact,

19:10.878 --> 19:13.813
inspiration, and it is forged

19:13.814 --> 19:16.749
in the enduring soul of humanity.

19:19.153 --> 19:21.921
You may know everything...

19:21.922 --> 19:24.190
but you understand nothing.

19:24.191 --> 19:27.560
Do not lecture <i> me</i> on art.

19:27.561 --> 19:29.562
For millennia, it has been

19:29.563 --> 19:35.335
created to celebrate my glory
by those who worship me.

19:35.336 --> 19:37.036
What have you given in
return for their fealty?

19:37.037 --> 19:38.404
After all, what is

19:38.405 --> 19:40.673
a god without worshippers?

19:40.674 --> 19:43.409
And what is a man without
belief in higher power?

19:43.410 --> 19:44.811
Both are lost.

19:46.614 --> 19:48.381
But then, of course,

19:48.382 --> 19:50.250
you knew that, didn't you...

O, Mighty One?

19:53.721 --> 19:55.822
You've always needed this, haven't you?

19:57.124 --> 19:58.224
Even as a child,

19:58.225 --> 20:00.860
you'd hide in the coach house,

20:00.861 --> 20:03.730
reading books forbidden
by the Church of England,

20:03.731 --> 20:06.533
lit only by a candle you'd stolen

20:06.534 --> 20:08.401
from the servants' quarters.

20:08.402 --> 20:12.739
You'd disappear for hours,
worry your mother sick.

How do you know this?

20:14.542 --> 20:17.777
You've always lived to
please; to serve...

20:17.778 --> 20:20.980

20:20.981 --> 20:24.217
No room to question your
own wants or identity.

Even your role as Witness was inherited

20:26.954 --> 20:28.455
through your bloodline.

20:28.456 --> 20:31.391
That wasn't a choice.

20:35.596 --> 20:37.230
You didn't know.

20:38.999 --> 20:43.136
Your life was mapped out
long before you were even born.

20:43.137 --> 20:47.140
So, how could you ever be
anything more than that boy

it's a chance for us.

24:47.011 --> 24:48.445
Or you could die!

24:50.181 --> 24:53.684
Joe, let's stick to a plan that
doesn't put anyone else at risk.

24:53.685 --> 24:54.885
We are all at risk.

24:54.886 --> 24:57.054
(rumbling)

25:03.628 --> 25:06.230
I'm in.

25:06.231 --> 25:07.865
HIDDEN ONE: You hunger

25:07.866 --> 25:09.366
at a time like this?

25:09.367 --> 25:11.234
I'm eating my feelings.

25:14.239 --> 25:17.040
So you believe I am part
of an ancient bloodline

25:17.041 --> 25:19.643
that dates back to a
time before history.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.411
Not a claim. The truth.

25:21.412 --> 25:24.414
This was left in my family tomb.

25:24.415 --> 25:27.184
HIDDEN ONE: It depicts Napalatu...

25:27.185 --> 25:30.754
my ancient enemies
and your forebearers.

25:30.755 --> 25:33.690
It also allows a remote
connection between them.

25:33.691 --> 25:34.791
Perhaps more.

25:34.792 --> 25:36.360
If I am trapped,

25:36.361 --> 25:39.062
the lieutenant is searching
for a way to release me.

25:39.063 --> 25:40.631
She is doomed to failure.

25:40.632 --> 25:44.434
Unless she sought help, as I would...

25:44.435 --> 25:47.604
from someone with the knowledge
of the Emblem of Thura.

25:47.605 --> 25:51.275
Pandora would never stoop to a
partnership with a lowly mortal.

25:51.276 --> 25:54.344
Humor me.

25:54.345 --> 25:55.913
What if they did form an alliance?

25:55.914 --> 26:00.250
What method would Pandora
employ to release you?

26:00.251 --> 26:03.987
Her Box could diffuse the barrier,

26:03.988 --> 26:07.591
but her power is at an all-time ebb.

26:07.592 --> 26:09.860
The lieutenant is nothing if not adept.

26:09.861 --> 26:11.829
And it falls on us to be the same.

26:11.830 --> 26:15.599
What part could we play
to aid in a rescue attempt?

26:15.600 --> 26:18.101
If I were to draw power from the Emblem

26:18.102 --> 26:20.537
as Pandora worked a spell with her Box,

26:20.538 --> 26:22.940
it might lower the barrier.

26:22.941 --> 26:25.642
But at the wrong moment,

26:25.643 --> 26:27.678
it could only make matters worse.

26:27.679 --> 26:30.814
If we could use this device

26:30.815 --> 26:32.482
to communicate with the lieutenant,

26:32.483 --> 26:35.419
we might be able to time it correctly.

26:36.788 --> 26:40.524
But it has only worked
intermittently at best.

26:40.525 --> 26:43.493
Because the cuneiform alphabet
you used to translate it

26:43.494 --> 26:46.663
is 600 years too young.

27:01.813 --> 27:03.046
Joe is like a brother to me.

27:03.047 --> 27:04.848
If you hurt him,

27:04.849 --> 27:07.651
there will be consequences.

27:07.652 --> 27:09.253
Do you understand?

27:09.254 --> 27:11.834
I cannot make any guarantees.

27:14.225 --> 27:16.293
But you already know that.

27:19.497 --> 27:22.165
Joe, please don't do this.

27:22.166 --> 27:24.168
I can't lose you.

27:24.169 --> 27:25.869
Hey...

27:25.870 --> 27:28.605
if that thing stays inside me,

27:28.606 --> 27:30.273
then you already have.

27:33.111 --> 27:35.691
PANDORA: We must proceed.

27:37.282 --> 27:38.782
I love you.

27:54.933 --> 27:56.633
I'm going to stay.

28:04.543 --> 28:07.711
PANDORA: So long as he stays
within the mystic circle,

28:07.712 --> 28:09.880
I can channel the energy
I need to shatter the barrier.

28:09.881 --> 28:12.783
But he must stay within it,

28:12.784 --> 28:15.652
for his safety, and ours.

28:44.582 --> 28:48.418
(groaning)

28:50.154 --> 28:51.655
(yelling)

28:51.656 --> 28:54.391
(snapping and cracking)

28:56.261 --> 28:57.594
(roaring)

28:57.595 --> 28:59.129
Joe...

28:59.130 --> 29:01.431
(growling)

29:04.539 --> 29:06.240
(roaring)

29:06.241 --> 29:07.374
Be calm, wild beast.

29:08.543 --> 29:12.379
(roaring, growling)

29:12.380 --> 29:14.381
Step back into the circle, beast.

29:14.382 --> 29:15.382
Get back!

29:15.383 --> 29:17.618
Stop! Stop!

29:20.722 --> 29:22.022
- He's lost.
- (growls)

29:22.023 --> 29:24.191
We need to leave him
here or end his life.

29:24.192 --> 29:27.127
No! I can get through to him.

29:28.180 --> 29:31.056
Joe, I know how much you care about me.

29:31.057 --> 29:32.223
You won't hurt me.

29:32.224 --> 29:34.401
- (growling)
- You would never hurt me.

29:34.402 --> 29:36.697
Joe, if you listen to me,

29:36.978 --> 29:39.424
I'll let you change out the
headers on the Scout's engine.

29:39.425 --> 29:40.941
- (growls)
- And a key.

29:40.942 --> 29:43.544
A key to my trailer.

29:43.545 --> 29:45.809
Because I always forget
to unlock the door,

29:45.810 --> 29:46.997
and I know you hate that.

29:48.984 --> 29:52.486
You are not this monster, Joe Corbin.

29:54.256 --> 29:56.390
You're the man I love.

29:56.391 --> 29:58.525
Do you hear me?

29:59.661 --> 30:02.329
I love you.

30:07.636 --> 30:08.902
(low growl)

30:08.903 --> 30:10.771
(gasps with relief)

30:16.011 --> 30:17.778
Do it now.

30:26.488 --> 30:29.523
O, Great Thura, heed my call.

30:29.524 --> 30:33.160
Your barrier, away must fall.

30:33.161 --> 30:37.086
By the power left in me,

30:37.329 --> 30:39.700
do as I beseech thee!

30:41.970 --> 30:45.739
(growling)

30:50.345 --> 30:53.647
(growling, groaning)

30:56.217 --> 30:59.954
(growling, groaning)

30:59.955 --> 31:02.523
Joe... he's in pain.

31:02.524 --> 31:03.957
What's wrong?

31:03.958 --> 31:06.356
PANDORA: I can harness
the power of the beast,

31:06.357 --> 31:07.928
but I can not direct it with precision.

31:10.832 --> 31:12.099
The Box, Abbie.

31:14.703 --> 31:17.003
Any fragments that you
have in your possession...

31:17.872 --> 31:19.339
I need them now.

31:20.342 --> 31:23.143
I was really,<i> really</i> hoping

31:23.144 --> 31:24.812
that you were not playing
me this whole time.

31:24.813 --> 31:26.814
Control yourself, Witness.

31:26.815 --> 31:28.200
The barrier...

31:28.503 --> 31:30.237
Joe, all of it,

31:30.238 --> 31:31.838
was a con

31:31.839 --> 31:33.024
so you could put your damn

31:33.025 --> 31:34.625
Box back together?

31:34.626 --> 31:37.929
I may be devious at a scale
that rivals the gods,

31:37.930 --> 31:39.697
but I assure you,

31:39.698 --> 31:42.800
at this moment,
I have no secret motive.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.402
Is that supposed to
be self-deprecating?

31:44.403 --> 31:45.570
Stop your lies.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.806
You do not understand.

31:48.807 --> 31:50.108
Understand what?

31:50.109 --> 31:52.710
It's my fault.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.878
All of it.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.948
My love's entrapment.

31:56.949 --> 32:00.284
Then, and now.

32:00.285 --> 32:03.421
It was I who told the
human servants long ago

32:03.422 --> 32:04.922
of the Emblem's power.

32:04.923 --> 32:08.126
To make them feel safe in our alliance.

32:08.127 --> 32:11.329
(laughs, pants)

32:11.330 --> 32:14.165
I never thought they would
use it against him.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.567
But they did.

32:16.568 --> 32:19.303
I walked the earth

32:19.304 --> 32:24.842
4,000 years, trying to release
him from their imprisonment...

32:24.843 --> 32:28.079
(wry laugh) ...only to err again.

32:29.815 --> 32:31.482
(laughs)

32:31.483 --> 32:34.819
Because I knew you had it.

32:34.820 --> 32:38.122
I knew you had the Emblem,

32:38.123 --> 32:40.725
and I did not tell him.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.698
(deep growl)

32:46.699 --> 32:48.132
(moaning)

32:54.106 --> 32:55.306
You must make a choice.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.775
We have only moments left.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.745
Abbie, he's dying.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.892
(pen scratching on paper)

33:39.485 --> 33:41.419
(metallic clink)

33:51.196 --> 33:52.536
Lieutenant...

33:53.432 --> 33:55.032
Lieutenant!

33:56.235 --> 33:59.504
(growling)

33:59.505 --> 34:00.538
- Joe...
- Master Corbin.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.706
(Joe yells)

34:01.707 --> 34:03.908
What's wrong?

34:03.909 --> 34:06.277
It was I who told the
human servants long ago,

34:06.278 --> 34:07.712
of the Emblem's power.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.786
I knew you had it.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.051
I knew you had the Emblem.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.686
And I did not tell him.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.262
They tried.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.397
At great peril.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.168
She <i> knew.</i>

34:35.373 --> 34:37.775
Omnipotence isn't always equal to...

34:37.775 --> 34:40.011
Wisdom.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.280
Enjoy the moment.

34:42.281 --> 34:43.581
(rumbling)

34:45.284 --> 34:47.318
I believe I will.

34:50.089 --> 34:54.257
As it is likely to be my last.

35:12.597 --> 35:14.732
(growling and groaning)

35:21.172 --> 35:22.572
Here.

35:48.165 --> 35:51.734
♪ ♪

35:56.207 --> 35:59.042
(moans, growls)

35:59.043 --> 36:02.078
Yes. This is right.

36:03.013 --> 36:06.149
It's working.

36:06.150 --> 36:08.318
Crane...

36:10.054 --> 36:12.689
(rumbling)

36:26.604 --> 36:28.037
(rumbling subsides)

36:28.038 --> 36:29.772
(shuddering)

36:39.683 --> 36:40.684
Joe...

36:40.885 --> 36:41.918
Joe.

36:41.919 --> 36:43.886
(coughing) Joe...

36:45.122 --> 36:46.489
(laughs)

36:50.761 --> 36:51.928
Crane!

36:51.929 --> 36:53.329
Lieutenant!

36:56.400 --> 36:58.735
Wait, wait, wait... I saw you.

36:58.736 --> 37:00.403
Through the Emblem of Thura, I saw you.

37:00.404 --> 37:02.038
You were with Pandora.

37:02.039 --> 37:04.374
I thought all was lost.

37:04.375 --> 37:06.242
Not quite.

37:10.247 --> 37:12.482
Well, thank you, Lieutenant.

37:12.483 --> 37:14.717
It seems yet again,
I owe you for my life.

37:14.718 --> 37:16.085
I'm keeping count.

37:17.488 --> 37:20.390
Bad news: Pandora has
a piece of her Box back.

37:22.259 --> 37:23.927
Hidden One?

37:23.928 --> 37:25.428
Hidden once more.

37:30.134 --> 37:31.601
What are you doing?

37:31.602 --> 37:34.203
The Emblem.

37:37.341 --> 37:39.609
The Emblem has been destroyed.

37:40.611 --> 37:42.145
We now have nothing to shield us

37:42.146 --> 37:43.513
from our enemies.

37:43.514 --> 37:46.316
You just faced a god
and lived to tell the tale.

37:46.317 --> 37:48.751
That is a win in any book.

37:50.321 --> 37:51.788
Yes... (sighs)

37:52.990 --> 37:55.325
Wait... the... the Hidden One.

37:55.326 --> 37:57.627
The Hidden One revealed to me

37:57.628 --> 37:59.829
some rather unexpected information.

37:59.830 --> 38:01.764
Lieutenant,

38:01.765 --> 38:04.634
our mantle as Witnesses...

38:04.635 --> 38:07.704
it is passed down
through our bloodlines.

38:09.173 --> 38:10.640
- So all of our ancestors...
- I know.

38:10.641 --> 38:13.443
I know, it is all rather...

38:13.444 --> 38:14.844
(imitates explosion)

38:14.845 --> 38:16.179
What is that?

38:16.180 --> 38:17.514
(laughing): Mind blown?

38:17.515 --> 38:19.883
Head exploding?

38:19.884 --> 38:21.684
I don't know. I'm very hungry.

38:21.685 --> 38:24.320
Donut Man is open 24 hours,

38:24.321 --> 38:25.688
and I think you've earned it.

38:25.689 --> 38:28.224
You are a very good person.

38:33.030 --> 38:35.965
Sit, tough guy.

38:35.966 --> 38:37.467
(Joe groans)

38:40.538 --> 38:42.238
How you doing?

38:42.239 --> 38:43.506
(groans)

38:43.507 --> 38:44.908
That bad.

38:46.076 --> 38:47.710
Why don't I get you a drink?

38:47.711 --> 38:49.412
(both laugh gently)

38:57.822 --> 38:59.322
You said the words.

39:01.926 --> 39:03.192
JOE: All three of them.

39:04.094 --> 39:05.595
Did I?

39:05.596 --> 39:07.597
I don't really recall.

39:07.598 --> 39:10.300
I think you also offered me a key.

39:11.569 --> 39:13.837
Yeah, see, Joe, there's
no easy way to say this,

39:13.838 --> 39:15.905
but, um...

39:15.906 --> 39:17.840
I offered that key to the Wendigo.

39:19.243 --> 39:21.044
So here's the problem:

39:21.045 --> 39:23.379
Now, just... I mean,
based on how crappy I feel,

39:23.380 --> 39:26.850
and how much monster-ness
Pandora ripped out of me,

39:26.851 --> 39:28.284
I have a feeling

39:28.285 --> 39:30.086
I'm finally cured of that thing.

39:30.087 --> 39:32.622
Wish I could help.

39:38.462 --> 39:40.630
Mmm... (chuckles)

39:51.208 --> 39:52.375
You know, I was also
thinking about getting

39:52.376 --> 39:53.610
my old band back together.

39:53.611 --> 39:55.278
I hope that's not gonna be a problem.

39:55.279 --> 39:56.613
- Ooh...
- I mean, we'd only want

39:56.614 --> 39:58.691
to practice over here,
like, three nights a week,

39:58.692 --> 39:59.782
- maybe four, max.
- I'll just...

39:59.783 --> 40:01.484
- Can I get that back?
- And we're not really that loud.

40:01.485 --> 40:02.996
- We're kind of loud.
- Maybe just give me the key back.

40:02.997 --> 40:03.887
- Come and get it.
- Yeah, no...

40:03.888 --> 40:05.155
I think I need back my key.

40:05.156 --> 40:06.256
(laughing)

40:06.257 --> 40:07.457
Give me the key.

40:07.458 --> 40:08.925
Ow! Ow! Ow! Give it...

40:08.926 --> 40:10.893
(laughing): Joe, give me...

40:19.570 --> 40:20.670
My love.

40:22.606 --> 40:24.841
You've returned.

40:24.842 --> 40:26.175
PANDORA: Mm.

40:27.578 --> 40:29.712
It was you that saved me.

40:30.915 --> 40:34.484
You are the most devious of creatures.

40:34.485 --> 40:36.419
The way you played our enemies,

40:36.420 --> 40:38.121
got them to provide

40:38.122 --> 40:41.958
what was needed for you
to bring down Thura's barrier.

40:41.959 --> 40:45.662
And I recovered a piece
of the Box in the process.

40:45.663 --> 40:50.667
The humans had the Emblem
in their possession,

40:50.668 --> 40:53.236
and I had no idea.

40:55.139 --> 40:59.175
It was an unexpected turn of events.

40:59.176 --> 41:02.879
But again, one which you
turned to our advantage.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.048
Yes, my love.

41:05.049 --> 41:07.550
But I'm exhausted by all this.

41:07.551 --> 41:10.131
Let us set it aside for now.

41:11.455 --> 41:15.225
But as you know very well, my love,

41:15.226 --> 41:17.894
such matters cannot
be set aside forever.

41:19.363 --> 41:23.266
Especially when one
discovers a pressing falsehood.

41:25.536 --> 41:27.804
We have much to discuss, Pandora.

41:27.805 --> 41:29.472
We can start

41:29.473 --> 41:31.774
with the truth.

41:33.031 --> 41:38.884
