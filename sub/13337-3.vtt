WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:01.560
.

00:07.480 --> 00:11.840
The Geordies are back and we're
leaving the Toon and hitting Greece.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.440
Greece, you're about to get done.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.840
(shouting)
Come on!

00:19.280 --> 00:22.440
It's gonna be pool parties...
Boat parties!

00:23.520 --> 00:27.320
More drama.
Fuck this shit, I'm not doing it.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.120
(shouting)

00:29.200 --> 00:30.320
More tashing on.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.760
More fucking tragedy.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.080
Slag!

00:38.560 --> 00:41.960
(sighs) Don't fucking ever speak
to me again.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.400
Total carnage.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.280
Fuck, shit, what have I done now?

00:55.520 --> 00:57.320
And a shit load of bucking, like.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.000
Greece, the Geordie gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.360
(Nathan)What the fuck is this, man?
(shrieking)

01:13.440 --> 01:15.200
It can't get any worse.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.360
Me and Kyle are in a really good
place now and I'm so happy.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.560
I miss single life.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.800
Whatever's going on between them,
she deserves better.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.600
You never know,
maybe this could go somewhere.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.640
Sorry, that's what it feels like
to be mugged off.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.880
I will stay faithful to my boyfriend.
Marnie loves girls.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.480
If you're gonna get action
from somewhere,

01:46.560 --> 01:48.640
it's better from a girl than Aaron.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.600
What? Scott!

01:50.680 --> 01:53.320
It's like necking on
with my fucking sister.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.440
Eurgh. No!
No.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.400
Nothing like being pied
by your best mate.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.280
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.800
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.400
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.480
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.760
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.480
I'm preened to perfection.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.680
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.520
I'm fit, flirty and I've got FFs.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.920
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.440
Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:37.680 --> 02:39.800
Morning.
Morning, Nathan.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.920
I've woken up fresh
and not full of dread.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.760
This almost feels
as good as an orgasm.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.640
I've actually woke up happy.
Me too.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.400
Ah, it actually was wicked
last night,

02:53.480 --> 02:55.600
the problem was you two,
pulling-wise.

02:55.680 --> 02:59.520
We wake up and once again no-one's
in the shag pad and no-one's pulled.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.120
Boys, come on.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.080
If you wanted to,
you could have fucking had Chloe.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.400
Chloe went out her way
to try and piss Scott off.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.560
If she's gonna try
and purposely go to wind me up,

03:10.640 --> 03:12.400
just fucking shove her off.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.200
Hold on.
You don't fancy Chloe,

03:14.280 --> 03:17.480
but you're annoyed when I flirt
with her? Make up your mind.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.800
Holly didn't sleep in here again.
You know what she did, right?

03:26.880 --> 03:30.840
She asked me to sleep with her
on the bed in there

03:30.920 --> 03:34.600
and then she was just like,
"Oh, you can't sleep here any more."

03:34.680 --> 03:36.600
"You'll never be able to fit in."

03:39.200 --> 03:42.160
She's my best friend
and I never see her any more.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.240
All she wants to do
is be with Kyle.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.960
I do feel like
we're not seeing her much.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.640
How does that happen
when you live in the same house?

03:55.680 --> 03:58.880
Anna well and truly fucked us over
sending us to this barn,

03:58.960 --> 04:01.200
but we've checked it over
like she said

04:01.280 --> 04:03.880
and now we're off to Malia.
Get in!

04:05.080 --> 04:08.440
I cannot wait to get back
to civilisation and see a fanny

04:08.520 --> 04:11.440
which isn't stuck
to the back of a goat.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.400
Ah, you fucker.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.880
Get me off this farm.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.040
To the beach, mate.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.480
We've been in the mountains
long enough.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.080
I know we're going to a new house,
but we're going via the beach.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.000
(Scott)Beach!
(cheering)

04:38.960 --> 04:40.680
It's so nice to get to the beach.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.880
There's actually real people here
and not farm animals.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.280
Cheers, girls.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.920
It's great spending some time
at the beach.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.120
We can finally get our tan on.

04:55.200 --> 04:59.640
This would be the perfect opportunity
for Holly to spend time with girls,

04:59.720 --> 05:05.200
but she's not, she's glued to
Kyle's side like a bloody barnacle!

05:10.920 --> 05:13.760
This beach day
is what everybody has needed.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.760
Now it's time to go and see
what the next house is like.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.960
It cannot be any worse
than that farm.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.760
Fucking buzzing!

05:23.840 --> 05:26.920
Ah! This is amazing!

05:27.000 --> 05:29.880
Fucking hell.
It's unbelievable, man.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.040
It's the kind of place
you'd dream of.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.200
Shag pad.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.960
I must say,
this place is pure naughty.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.840
It's got Jacuzzis in the room big
enough to fit all of us girls in.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.800
There's a suction one here.
What does suction do?

05:43.880 --> 05:44.920
(all) Ooh.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.480
This is what we needed.
Tonight is gonna be unbelievable.

06:03.360 --> 06:07.080
This is the first time we've got
ready in the same room for so long.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.520
Proper girls' night.
It feels like a girls' night.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.760
Me and the girls are getting ready

06:12.840 --> 06:15.560
and drumming it into Holly
that it's girls' night,

06:15.640 --> 06:17.200
so she'll spend time with us.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.880
It's clits before cocks.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.960
Yep. Clits before cocks, clits
before cocks, clits before cocks.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.560
It's good to hang with the girls,
but we're going to the same club

06:26.640 --> 06:29.080
so I'll be able to get
a cheeky kiss from Kyle.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.400
Tonight me and the boys are gonna
have a lads' night.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.800
We're gonna separate Kyle
from his missus,

06:37.880 --> 06:40.680
cos he needs to stop being a melt
and get some banter.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.320
Help me!

06:48.400 --> 06:52.040
The lads are telling us I'm with
them tonight and that's fair enough.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.560
I need to have lads' nights
and Holly nights.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.560
When I was single
I was pulling every single night.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.760
We're in fucking Greece and Scott
and Aaron still haven't banged yet.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.160
Let's have a pulling competition.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.280
Bring it on. We've got a shag pad
that's not full of chickens.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.840
I'm gonna be in there tonight.
Sorry, Scott.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.040
One, two, three.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.640
Watch and learn, cos Daddy is gonna
show you how to take the trash out.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.720
(all) Malia!

07:31.800 --> 07:34.600
Although I'm not on the pull,
it's still a lads' night

07:34.680 --> 07:37.400
and it's gonna be mint.
Let's get mortal, lads.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.440
I am bouncing my dick
all around Malia.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.440
Turn around, touch the ground,
get blast off Scotty T.

07:49.520 --> 07:52.520
Get to the club,
everyone's smashed, tunes are wicked.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.400
Surely tonight is the night
that the lads get off the mark.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.720
(all) Cheers!

08:09.480 --> 08:11.520
I've had a mint night
with the lads.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.560
This is exactly what I needed.

08:18.600 --> 08:23.720
Buzzing for Chloe. She's pulled not
one but two lads. What a ledge.

08:28.360 --> 08:33.120
Chloe has brought two lads into the
area and Scotty T looks fuming.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.760
Not nice when the shoe's
on the other foot.

08:37.680 --> 08:40.560
She needs to be careful
in case he eats her shorts.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.520
Scott hoiked something at Chloe
while she's necking on.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.320
What was it?
Some of your toys out of the pram?

08:54.400 --> 08:56.400
Cowabunga!

09:00.360 --> 09:02.920
Kyle doesn't seem
to be speaking to me.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't know
what the fuck I've done.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.200
He's taken lads' night
to a new level.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.040
He hasn't looked at Holly,
hasn't spoke to her.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.880
You're allowed to say hello.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.320
We're supposed to be having
a girls' night

09:34.400 --> 09:37.560
and all Holly's doing is
trying to see what Kyle's up to.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.800
What about me?
What about what I'm up to?

09:45.880 --> 09:48.360
Me and Holly used to be crazy, wild,

09:48.440 --> 09:52.280
we used to be slags
and now she's none of them things.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.520
She's saying we're drifting apart.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.600
She's my best friend. I love her.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.920
I don't know where all this
has come from.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.640
Thanks. So I'm good for you
when you need us,

10:18.720 --> 10:23.000
but what about when I need you?
Will you be busy sucking Kyle off?

10:24.680 --> 10:28.960
Scott and Aaron have eventually
pulled two girls. Fucking hallelujah.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.640
Scott's pulled
and I don't give a shit.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.360
My lad's mate is desperate
to get on the action.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.920
I've just experienced
my first three-way kiss.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.920
I'm now not a legend.
I have moved up to a lord.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.760
There's so much weird pulling
going on tonight.

10:50.840 --> 10:53.560
I'm looking over,
Chloe's getting spit roasted,

10:53.640 --> 10:55.640
Scott's doing sit-ups with his girl

10:55.720 --> 10:59.240
and Aaron looks like he's in
the Grand National, for God's sake.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.560
Is that a girl or a jockey?
This is not sexy.

11:02.640 --> 11:06.160
You two have been great company.
But sorry, it's a girls' night

11:06.240 --> 11:09.280
and they're the only people
I wanna go home with.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.680
Watching Scott and Aaron,
I feel like a proud older brother,

11:12.760 --> 11:15.320
but now it's gonna be a race
for this shag pad.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.680
Kyle has not spoken to me tonight
and it's making us feel embarrassed.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.440
Why would he go on
like that with his girlfriend?

11:24.520 --> 11:27.480
I know it's girls' night,
but he has not once spoken to me.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.960
I'm gonna go back with the girls
and I couldn't give two shits.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.160
He is a disrespectful bastard.

11:33.240 --> 11:38.000
Here we go again. Holly's banging on
about Kyle. I've had enough.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.280
All you do is talk about him
who fucks you off,

11:41.360 --> 11:45.440
who doesn't fucking care about you.
You are obsessed.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.320
I can't believe Charlotte
is having a go about this

11:48.400 --> 11:50.520
in front of everybody.
Is she for real?

11:50.600 --> 11:53.800
I genuinely wasn't angry.
I'm not gonna get angry or upset.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.600
I've been angry every night
since I've been here.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.520
Cos I'm here?
You've ignored us.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.280
You haven't slept with us

12:00.360 --> 12:03.560
and fucking all you've talked about
is Kyle

12:03.640 --> 12:06.200
every minute of every day!

12:06.280 --> 12:09.320
This is all kicking off
and I'm stuck in the middle of it.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.040
I need out of this taxi.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.800
We get back to the villa
and I'm so upset.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.280
Out of everybody, I would have
thought Charlotte had my back.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.760
I did not deserve that in the taxi
there. I did not deserve that.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.760
I have tried to tell you
something that happened...

12:26.840 --> 12:31.200
In front of people. If I ever had
to say anything like that to you,

12:31.280 --> 12:34.480
I'd have said it in private,
not in a fucking taxi

12:34.560 --> 12:37.280
and belittle me
in front of everybody else.

12:37.360 --> 12:41.280
Everyone knows.
Everyone's been talking about it.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.640
Exactly!

12:42.720 --> 12:46.040
So therefore you, as my best friend,
should have turned round

12:46.120 --> 12:48.560
and done it in private,
not in front of people

12:48.640 --> 12:51.360
because you know
how embarrassing that would be.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.200
Someone needed to say it.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.400
We can't all keep living
in Kyle and Holly world.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.040
Not once have I ever spoken
behind your back!

12:59.120 --> 13:00.560
We spoke about it once.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.000
Not once have I ever spoken
behind your back!

13:03.080 --> 13:05.400
I told you to your face today.

13:05.480 --> 13:10.160
So fuck off. Don't fucking ever
speak to me again. Never. Stop.

13:10.240 --> 13:14.000
I can't believe this has happened
tonight. I'm in absolute shock.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.080
I am angry,
because I've lost my best friend.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.680
She's lost her best friend?

13:18.760 --> 13:22.760
Well, I lost mine fucking ages ago,
as soon as Kyle walked in this house.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.160
I just literally feel

13:25.240 --> 13:28.440
like every single person
in this house has ganged up on us.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.200
I'm not doing this any more.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.600
What the fuck is going on here, man?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.640
What the hell have I done now, man?

13:35.720 --> 13:38.640
(Marnie)You haven't.
It's your girlfriend.

13:38.720 --> 13:42.360
Why is Kyle still standing in the
kitchen like some fucking idiot?

13:42.440 --> 13:44.560
When your girl is upset
and walks out,

13:44.640 --> 13:47.560
I'm sure the boyfriend
is supposed to go after her.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.360
Oh, for God's sake.
What's up?

13:54.440 --> 13:56.680
What's up? I'll listen to you,
come on.

13:56.760 --> 14:01.560
She turned round and literally
flipped on us in front of everybody

14:01.640 --> 14:05.080
and I feel this big, because
I feel like everybody in this house

14:05.160 --> 14:07.480
has been talking about us
behind me back.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.160
Not the case.
No-one's talking behind your back.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.840
I'm not talking about you,
it's everyone else.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.120
No-one else has been
talking about you.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.080
Apparently they have.
You're meant to be on my side.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.680
I am on your side.
No-one's talking about you.

14:20.760 --> 14:24.760
I don't understand why this argument
has been turned round on me.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.680
I was having a good night.

14:26.760 --> 14:32.040
But you don't understand us.
You do not understand me at all.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.040
I fucking solidly understand you.

14:34.120 --> 14:38.600
I don't know what to do any more.
Everything I do just seems wrong.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.240
What are you doing?

14:40.320 --> 14:42.920
What am I doing?
You're fucking shouting at me!

14:43.000 --> 14:46.880
You're shouting at me! What do you
expect us to do? I'm fucking angry!

14:46.960 --> 14:50.880
Fuck this shit! I'm not doing
it any more, man. Fucking hell!

14:52.960 --> 14:56.600
I can't do this shit any more, man!
I can't fucking act like this.

14:56.680 --> 15:01.120
Kyle has stormed away from Holly.
As much as I don't wanna see her now,

15:01.200 --> 15:05.120
I can't have her crying alone.
It kills us even hearing it.

15:05.200 --> 15:11.040
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Holly, I'm so sorry.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.320
I never wanted it to turn out
like this.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.800
All I wanted was my best friend back.

15:15.880 --> 15:19.040
I didn't mean any of that
to come across in a bad way,

15:19.120 --> 15:22.960
but I just needed you to know,
because this isn't you.

15:23.040 --> 15:26.240
Look, this isn't you.
This isn't you, Hol.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.840
It's absolutely soul destroying
seeing my best friend so weak

15:29.920 --> 15:34.640
and desperate over someone who
I really don't think cares about her.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.520
I don't want you
to be like this any more.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.920
I don't want you
to feel like this any more.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.720
I know you do, I know.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.360
I just feel so alone and so lost

15:45.440 --> 15:47.840
and I don't know
what I'm gonna do about it.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.200
I said Scott can have the shag
pad first, but only for an hour,

15:59.280 --> 16:02.520
so fair's fair, let him have
his hour and then I'll go next.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.720
So I've got this bird back
and we're going to the shag pad.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.400
She takes off all her clothes
and takes off all of my clothes,

16:09.480 --> 16:12.400
we get into bed and then she says
we're not having sex.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.840
Who the fuck does that?

16:16.080 --> 16:19.120
Sorry, Scott, time's up.
It's my turn for the shag pad.

16:19.200 --> 16:23.040
(knocking)
It's me, Aaron.

16:23.120 --> 16:26.760
He won't answer the door and then
when he does, he opens it naked.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.800
I try to get in
and he pushes us out.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.920
Fucking stupid little prick.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.840
That dick won't let me in the shag
pad, but no way am I losing out,

16:34.920 --> 16:37.240
so I take my girl outside
onto the balcony.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.360
(dog barking)

16:46.360 --> 16:48.080
(dog barking)

16:48.160 --> 16:50.480
Fuck off, dog,
I'm trying to have a bang.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.840
(dog barking)

16:54.920 --> 16:57.880
No chance are you
or Scotty T ruining my shag tonight.

17:24.200 --> 17:29.760
Last night was awful, but at least
one positive came out of it.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.680
Holly finally spent the night
in the girls' room. Every cloud.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.880
Are you OK, Hols?
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.200
One plus point is that me and you
managed to resolve things.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.360
I'm glad because you're the person

17:42.440 --> 17:44.880
who's gonna be there
when it all breaks down.

17:44.960 --> 17:48.560
But it's not necessarily
gonna break down, Hol.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.560
Even though she's been hard work,
I do feel for her.

17:51.640 --> 17:55.080
She's only doing it because
she's totally in love with Kyle.

17:55.160 --> 17:58.480
I don't know why you wanna be
with someone making you like this.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.560
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.680
The last thing I wanna do
is break up.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.960
It all kicked off last night
and guess who it was over?

18:19.040 --> 18:20.520
Fucking Holly and Kyle.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.200
I can't do anything right.

18:22.280 --> 18:26.040
You can't just go back up there
and, like, play happy families

18:26.120 --> 18:29.760
and have a chat and it's all OK.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.200
I'm fed up about talking about
all this shit.

18:32.280 --> 18:36.360
I can't speak to Holly and I'm
boring the lads. I need some space.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.800
Last night might have been shit for
Kyle, but I had a quality night.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.400
I got a bang, even though Scott
locked me out the shag pad.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.760
Did she do anything?
Nah.

18:55.840 --> 18:59.840
So after all that Scott didn't even
bang last night? What the fuck?

18:59.920 --> 19:02.640
You should have left the shag pad
so he could get in.

19:02.720 --> 19:06.040
He didn't give us a chance.
He started kicking off.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.120
You went,
after an hour I can have it.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.600
Once again you just talked shit
and you didn't give us it, so...

19:11.680 --> 19:13.200
You shagged her anyway.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.800
Although Scott tried to fuck him
over, he managed to get off the mark

19:16.880 --> 19:19.000
in the pulling competition.
Well done.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.280
Fair enough, I'll let the kid
have his moment,

19:22.360 --> 19:25.520
but I can Scotty guarantee you

19:25.600 --> 19:28.120
that I will fucking nail
this competition.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.280
We're sick of Kyle having
a face like a smacked arse.

19:36.360 --> 19:39.120
It's time we got him out this house.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.200
Girls?
Yeah?

19:41.280 --> 19:44.360
We're off to a water park, so...
ta-ra.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.600
I'm so frustrated.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.680
All I wanna do is to be able
to sort things out with Kyle,

19:49.760 --> 19:53.120
but once again I'm having
to wait until he's ready.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.360
How was that, Hols?
Fine.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.240
Just a bit frustrated
that this keeps happening.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.760
I don't feel like
I'm being understood.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.320
I'm so bored of
Holly and Kyle's dramas.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.480
It's bringing the house down.
I'm absolutely sick.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.360
But what can I do?

20:11.440 --> 20:14.840
He should understand you.
Your boyfriend should get you.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.120
I do feel bad that we haven't
invited the others, but who cares?

20:25.280 --> 20:29.000
It's wicked being with the lads.
Got no dramas, no hassle.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.960
No-one kicking off. It's nice to
see Kyle with a smile on his face.

20:40.080 --> 20:44.760
Finally I'm enjoying Greece.
This is fucking class. Cheers, lads.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.320
This is what I needed to take
my mind off Holly and that house.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.520
We're just getting started.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.480
This water park is fucking wicked.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.800
This is a good chance for me
to talk to Kyle

21:08.880 --> 21:10.640
and find out what is going on.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.200
This is what I need.
I need time with the lads.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.760
I mean, Holly...
She's my best friend.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.560
Just can't stop arguing with her
and it's fucking killing us.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.920
If I was in Kyle's position,
I'd have sacked this off ages ago.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.760
It's not a healthy relationship.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.360
I don't know how much more of this
I can take.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.480
All we can do is hope
this water park has done Kyle good.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.400
It's time to get back to the house.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.160
How was it?

21:45.000 --> 21:48.480
Today was absolutely wicked,
so let's just keep the fun going.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.560
Tonight we're going to a toga party.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.680
What's a toga?
Holly, you love togas!

21:53.760 --> 21:55.840
What the fuck's a toga?

21:59.160 --> 22:02.480
A toga party? Lots of hot boys
and hot girls in short linen.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.040
This is gonna be fun.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.640
Can I have a word with you
in the shag pad?Yeah.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.480
The toga party does sound mint,

22:10.560 --> 22:13.360
but before we go there
I really need to chat to Holly.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.280
He's had some space from me.
That is what he wanted.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.640
Hopefully we're able
to work through this.

22:18.720 --> 22:22.040
Are you OK after last night?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.160
It wasn't meant to go like that.

22:24.240 --> 22:27.200
It wasn't meant to be
an argument between me and you.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.400
It was between me and Charlotte.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.360
All I needed was his affection.
Why can't he see that?

22:32.440 --> 22:34.600
But if I get involved,
we end up arguing.

22:34.680 --> 22:38.040
The reason I stayed out
of Holly and Charlotte's bickering

22:38.120 --> 22:41.520
is because my relationship
can't afford any more arguments.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.160
What's Kyle been like today then?

22:45.240 --> 22:48.760
They've gone for a chat.
We're wondering what's gonna happen.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.880
They better not ruin the toga party.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.880
What does he actually want?
I don't think he knows himself.

23:00.960 --> 23:04.200
None of us even know
what's happening with this situation.

23:04.280 --> 23:07.240
Holly thinks she's got
a relationship worth salvaging,

23:07.320 --> 23:09.840
the lads think Kyle
wants to be single

23:09.920 --> 23:13.080
and I'm starting to think
he's just a full-on bell-end.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.600
Yeah, I feel the same.
I wanna fight for this.

23:20.680 --> 23:23.560
We've been through so much
and I love him to bits.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.880
I'm not gonna drink tonight.
I'm not drinking either.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.600
The root of all our problems
is alcohol,

23:29.680 --> 23:32.200
so tonight we're both
gonna have to not drink.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.400
Can I have a cuddle now, then?
Yeah.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.120
I've made up with Kyle.
It's time to get ready for tonight.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.280
What's your Greek goddess name?
I'm gonna be Xena.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.240
Margaret. Or Barbara.

23:53.320 --> 23:56.440
I've always wanted to be called
Margaret Barbara.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.760
Margaret fucking Barbara?

23:58.840 --> 24:01.440
Chloe,
you're meant to be a Greek god,

24:01.520 --> 24:03.520
not a fucking Victorian.

24:03.600 --> 24:08.000
I've got me own Greek god tonight.
So are you back to being all right?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.680
Yeah, we're fine.
We're just this type of couple.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.560
It's that type of a relationship.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.720
Holly's telling us her and Kyle
are fine now. Whatever.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.400
Keep telling yourself that.

24:17.480 --> 24:20.520
Do you think that you'll end up
with Scott tonight?

24:20.600 --> 24:23.520
Nah, nah. I don't really care.
He can do what he wants.

24:23.600 --> 24:27.920
Tonight's about me pulling another
lad. Scott is not on my menu.

24:38.160 --> 24:41.360
We're ready for this toga party
and we all look pretty shit,

24:41.440 --> 24:45.160
but, Scott, did you not get the memo?
Why are you wearing a mini dress?

24:45.240 --> 24:47.440
That's what Greeks
used to wear in the day.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.240
Mate, it's so comfortable.
Breezy, feels like a dress.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.360
How did your chat with Holly go?

24:53.440 --> 24:57.280
It was class. We sorted everything
out and we're fine again now.

24:57.360 --> 25:00.040
Kyle's telling the boys him
and Holly are sweet

25:00.120 --> 25:02.240
and they've sorted out
their problems.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.400
I couldn't give a fuck.
I've got problems of my own.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.800
Me dick is hanging out
the bottom of me toga.

25:07.880 --> 25:11.400
We've both decided, I know it's not
gonna be happy with the lads,

25:11.480 --> 25:13.240
but we've decided not to drink.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.840
Just for one night
try and avoid the arguments.

25:15.920 --> 25:19.040
If you can't drink with your bird,
what's the point in one?

25:25.560 --> 25:26.920
Nah.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.400
Gaz said if I don't pull tonight,
I should crack on with Chloe.

25:30.480 --> 25:34.640
I could click my fingers and she
would teleport onto me fucking wang.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.560
(cheering)

25:37.880 --> 25:39.680
Tonight is gonna be sick.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.520
(Aaron)Everyone's in togas.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.720
Who knew girls could look so sexy
in a bed sheet?

26:07.080 --> 26:10.600
I haven't come to Greece to marry
Chloe. I'm gonna do what I do best,

26:10.680 --> 26:12.840
bucking birds
and fucking booting off.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.800
Me and Charlotte have promised
to wingwoman Chloe. It's wicked.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.840
I love living life through Chloe.
It's amazing.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.400
I am in a relationship,

26:31.480 --> 26:34.720
but I feel as though I'm single
when I'm helping Chloe pull.

26:40.840 --> 26:43.000
Obviously the best thing to do

26:43.080 --> 26:46.520
is do another three-way kiss
right in front of him.

26:46.600 --> 26:50.400
Am I bothered? Aye, my life's over.
I'm pure distraught.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.120
The girls are jealous of the lad
I've necked on with,

26:55.200 --> 26:56.360
so give us a smooch.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.200
Whatever girls can do,
the lads can do better.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.840
Watch and learn,
girls, watch and learn.

27:10.520 --> 27:14.120
The lads are so jealous they all
start necking on with each other.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.600
Well, that's embarrassing.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.080
(Nathan)A five-way kiss?

27:19.160 --> 27:22.200
That's the most action
I've had since I've been in Greece.

27:22.280 --> 27:26.000
Suck this. I'm off to find myself
some fucking Greek mott, me, like.

27:33.840 --> 27:36.400
This party's going off, wicked night.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.520
Holly and Kyle are in the corner
with glasses of water

27:39.600 --> 27:41.640
with faces like slapped arses.

27:43.240 --> 27:46.440
They said they've made up.
Let's see how long that lasts.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.840
I'm necking on with the girl
from last night.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.840
Scott is with another bird.

28:07.480 --> 28:10.760
I've had a wicked night.
I won't let Scott pulling ruin it.

28:10.840 --> 28:13.680
She'll take one look
at his hairy gooch and run a mile.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.960
Tonight's actually been wicked.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.880
No arguments and me boys have pulled.
Let's get home.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.880
Surprise, surprise, Scott has been
pied by his bird last minute.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.240
That kid is definitely
losing his touch.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.840
Looks like the shag pad
is all mine tonight.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.360
Aaron's banging on about
top shagger

28:40.440 --> 28:43.200
and then he brings
the same bird back as last night.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.520
What's going on? Is the kid in love?
The fucking muffin.

28:48.600 --> 28:53.040
Scott is not taking this well.
He is the worst loser I know.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.640
This bed's noisy, isn't it?

28:55.720 --> 28:58.080
Compared to last night,
it's a good shag.

28:58.160 --> 29:01.880
I'm in a bed and there's no hounds
to put me off my stride.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.120
Fucking get in.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.640
I'm smashed and I need to go to bed,
but the last person I thought

29:10.720 --> 29:14.520
who would be helping me into bed
and tucking me in would be Chloe.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.160
There you go.
I'll put you in your bed.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.240
So I'm busy putting fuck face to bed

29:19.320 --> 29:23.560
and I spot Scott in the room
and I think "Mm, why not?".

29:26.760 --> 29:29.040
Minding my own business,
munching crisps

29:29.120 --> 29:31.680
until she comes up
wanting something else.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.120
This is a pure win-win.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.400
She's promised us that I can pull
other birds and she won't kick off.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.880
Howay then, babe,
get your fucking jaw out.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.600
(Gaz snores)

29:46.720 --> 29:48.320
Gaz, shut up, man.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.200
I'm trying to get
fucking Van Goghed over here, mate.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.440
(moaning)
Me and Kyle are in the kitchen.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.960
It sounds like Scott's strangling
an ostrich in his bedroom.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.720
(moaning)

30:04.040 --> 30:07.720
Nope, that's Chloe. Go on, lass.
Didn't take them long, did it?

30:07.800 --> 30:11.040
I hate to admit it, but Scotty T
is kinda good with his fingers.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.920
He gets the thumbs up from me.
Cheers, kid.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.160
Sorry, lovebirds,
but this lad needs his sleep,

30:20.240 --> 30:22.320
so you can fuck off
out of my bed, like.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.520
I've had a mint night.
I've necked off with two lads

30:25.600 --> 30:28.160
and I've been finger puppeted
by Scott.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.040
Come here and give us a snuggle.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.560
(snoring)

30:52.440 --> 30:53.960
What the fuck?

30:54.040 --> 30:59.600
I've woken up and the first thing
I see is Scott next to us in bed.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.480
Is this a dream?
Is this a nightmare? Is this real?

31:02.560 --> 31:07.240
Thank fuck for that.
Chloe is spooning him, phew.

31:07.320 --> 31:10.120
You look like a cute couple
laying next to each other.

31:10.200 --> 31:14.440
Cute couple? Have you lost your
dad's bike? Fucking nee chance.

31:14.520 --> 31:17.280
Did you..?
No, we didn't. No.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.960
How did it play last night?

31:19.040 --> 31:21.400
Great, I was horny
and I wanted the finger.

31:21.480 --> 31:25.560
How many fingers, though?
Cos Scott's fingers are huge.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.520
Scotty T's hands are like jumbo jets.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.640
I'm surprised we didn't feel
the turbulence last night.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.920
What else did you and Scott
do last night?

31:34.000 --> 31:37.640
I might have sucked the penis,
because I actually have improved.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.520
Last time round I gave Scott
my first ever blowy.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.360
He said I wasn't very good, but
practice makes perfect, doesn't it?

31:44.440 --> 31:45.840
(mumbles)
What?

31:45.920 --> 31:48.320
Better than last time?
Better than last time.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.920
At least I've still got
me fucking penis left.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.320
I had to buy a new one
from the organ donors.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.600
I've got a feeling this is
gonna be a recurring incident.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.120
No, it's not. I feel like
I'm in control of the situation.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.720
Last night I was horny
and wanting the finger.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.920
Everyone knows you can't catch
feelings from fingers.

32:14.920 --> 32:18.480
I must have been smashed last night.
Are you taking the piss?

32:18.560 --> 32:20.680
She was "Ah, ah,"
and I went "All right?"

32:20.760 --> 32:24.840
It's nice to wake up with people not
talking about me and Kyle for once.

32:24.920 --> 32:28.680
Last night we went out, we didn't
drink, we didn't argue, buzzing.

32:28.760 --> 32:33.720
He just didn't want Aaron to have
sex and him not to have sex.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.480
Oi-oi.
Hi, Aaron. Hiya.

32:36.560 --> 32:39.320
Last night was wicked.
I christened the shag pad.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.960
It might have been the same girl,
but a shag is a shag.

32:43.040 --> 32:46.280
Did you bang her, then?
Aye, I did. Wicked.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.520
Now he's fingered Chloe
there's no chance he'll pull.

32:52.600 --> 32:56.400
She is the ultimate cock blocker.
Oh, well, more birds for me.

33:03.200 --> 33:06.800
There's so much drama going on
in the villa at the minute

33:06.880 --> 33:10.360
and it feels so good for it to
finally not be around me and Gary,

33:10.440 --> 33:14.960
so now that we're friends
we can go and do friend things.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.200
Look at that.
Fucking octopus.

33:19.280 --> 33:23.080
There's an octopus on a washing line
and Charlotte's got to touch it.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.600
I've never seen Gary so scared
of a slimy pink thing.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.560
It's usually right up his street.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.240
This is fucking not funny any more.

33:33.320 --> 33:37.600
It felt like somebody hit me in the
face with eight used, slimy condoms.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.760
Not cool.

33:40.840 --> 33:44.600
After whacking Gary round the face
with an octopus a few times,

33:44.680 --> 33:47.000
we decided to do some snorkelling.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.760
(shrieks)

33:49.840 --> 33:53.160
It is a mask and a pipe you breathe
through. How hard can it be?

33:55.800 --> 34:00.400
I hate snorkelling! There's things
under the water that wanna eat us.

34:00.480 --> 34:04.240
And I don't mean lick us out,
like full-on have us for dinner.

34:04.320 --> 34:07.080
Howay?
Thought I could see a shark.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.680
(screams)

34:10.920 --> 34:12.640
What are you doing now?

34:12.720 --> 34:15.840
No, no, no, I'm going now,
I'm going, I don't like it.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.320
Although snorkelling
is absolutely shit,

34:19.400 --> 34:21.680
me and Gary are having such a laugh

34:21.760 --> 34:25.960
and the whole "being friends" thing
is actually all right.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.040
Us out of the house today,
it's nice.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.560
She whacked me in the face
with an octopus.

34:30.640 --> 34:34.880
That is on the list of the amazing,
funny things we've done together.

34:34.960 --> 34:39.360
The fact we're both happy in
relationships is absolutely amazing

34:39.440 --> 34:41.000
and it means the world to us.

34:43.600 --> 34:46.840
I've had such a nice day with Gary.
Bring on tonight.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.000
The girls are asking us questions
about Scott.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.680
I have to be honest
and tell them the truth.

34:56.760 --> 35:01.840
I've been feeling really horny
and dying to have sex with Scott.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.280
The reason why I haven't is
because I don't wanna get hurt

35:05.360 --> 35:07.880
and, like,
I don't wanna catch feelings.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.720
I don't think it's just feelings
you'll catch

35:10.800 --> 35:14.760
if Scotty's penis goes inside you.
I think you'll catch a lot more.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.960
What if you get a twinge?
Tonight I'm gonna stay strong.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.480
If I get a minge twinge,
I can use my fingers.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.960
The brush, that's the size
of Scott's hand?

35:23.040 --> 35:24.760
Yeah, this part.

35:26.320 --> 35:30.480
Take the birds here and put them in
Newcastle, I wouldn't look at them.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.960
Scotty has hit a dry patch.

35:32.040 --> 35:35.640
If he was as good at pulling
as he was at shit, stupid excuses,

35:35.720 --> 35:38.480
he'd be on top
of this shagger competition.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.960
Pinky promise?

35:55.360 --> 35:58.480
Scott reckons he's made
a pinky promise with Chloe.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.720
What a wanker.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.920
(all yell)

36:05.760 --> 36:07.520
I'm buzzing for tonight.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.000
(all yell)

36:12.120 --> 36:13.920
Tonight is gonna be sick.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.080
We get to the club
and it's fucking banging.

36:24.200 --> 36:28.600
I can't believe Scott hasn't banged
anyone. Mate, what are you doing?

36:35.320 --> 36:38.400
Looking at Holly and Kyle,
it's making us depressed.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.600
They don't look like
they're having a good time at all

36:42.680 --> 36:44.720
on this stupid drinking ban.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.320
They might as well buy a caravan
and go fishing.

36:53.120 --> 36:57.280
The first bird I pull is wicked,
an arse like grapefruits in a sock

36:57.360 --> 37:00.640
and I'm gonna put my face
right in the middle of it. Ha.

37:00.720 --> 37:04.480
I've spotted Scott with a girl and I
wanna show him what he's missing,

37:04.560 --> 37:07.480
so I'm gonna show him
some of my mint dance moves.

37:14.640 --> 37:18.160
Chloe's dancing like a dickhead
for Scott's attention.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.640
Girl looks ridiculous.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.960
The others are telling us
I should stop,

37:33.040 --> 37:36.360
to be honest, if Scott pisses off
I do not give a flying fuck.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.720
Chloe said she's not gonna kick off
if I pull a bird tonight,

37:45.800 --> 37:48.200
so I don't care if she's causing
a scene.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.520
It's gonna be my dick causing
a scene with this bird tonight.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.520
Chloe!

37:59.600 --> 38:03.240
Oh, my God, what the hell is going
on? I think Chloe might be dead.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.560
Chloe, get up!

38:04.640 --> 38:06.440
Open your eyes for me, darling.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.040
Ah, fuck, me fucking head!

38:12.080 --> 38:16.120
That's the last time I put on my
best dance moves for a lad. Gutted.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.720
Obviously that pinky promise
didn't work, mate.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.840
What the fuck has this night
turned into?

38:24.920 --> 38:27.960
Chloe's lucky to be alive.
Charlotte's wearing a sling.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.480
It was a good night
until Scott brought that girl in.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.360
All I wanna do now is go home.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.400
Scott's bringing a bird back tonight,
but lately he hasn't had much luck.

38:49.480 --> 38:52.280
Tonight he needs to seal the deal
and shag this bird.

38:55.640 --> 38:59.520
I am pissed off that Scott's pulled
and I haven't,

38:59.600 --> 39:02.520
so I'm gonna give him
a taste of his own medicine.

39:04.640 --> 39:08.360
I knocked myself out tonight,
but don't you worry about me, Scott.

39:08.440 --> 39:11.440
You just go upstairs
and shag your girl. Prick.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.600
Surprise, Aaron's locked
himself in the shag pad.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.800
Don't worry, lad, I can wait here
all night until you finish wanking.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.720
Aaron?
Yes?

39:23.800 --> 39:26.040
Open the door, lad.
Nah, soz, mate.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.240
What's brung this on?
Do you remember two nights ago?

39:29.320 --> 39:31.320
Yeah, I do, mate, I do.
Exactly.

39:31.400 --> 39:35.520
Fucking hell, so this is all about
me locking him out two nights ago.

39:35.600 --> 39:39.720
Here, are we on the seesaw in
the playground? Grow up, you dick.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.160
I don't know what Aaron's playing
at. The kid is being a knob.

39:47.240 --> 39:50.200
If I didn't have this bird
I'm gonna blast the arse off,

39:50.280 --> 39:53.680
I'd be putting the kid straight back
in his fucking box.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.240
I'm drunk and I'm winding myself up
more lying in the shag pad

39:58.320 --> 40:00.320
and Scott is gonna get the backlash.

40:09.040 --> 40:12.040
Brothers don't fuck each other
every chance they get.

40:18.560 --> 40:22.360
I can't wait any longer.
I'm just pissed off with Scott

40:22.440 --> 40:24.520
for everything he's done
in the past.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.680
Aaron might be touchy
cos I've disturbed his wank,

40:29.760 --> 40:32.560
but there's nee need to kick over
the clothes horse.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.720
Marns's just done
her fucking whites.

40:34.800 --> 40:40.680
Two days ago if he was my brother,
why would he not let... (grunts)

40:40.760 --> 40:43.480
Aaron is fuming.
To be honest, I do feel quite bad.

40:43.560 --> 40:46.400
This is down to the pulling
competition that I set up.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.680
It's sending these two over the edge.

40:48.760 --> 40:51.520
Here, Scott, Scott!
I'm not talking to you, mate.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.600
Scott! Brother.

40:54.680 --> 40:58.360
Yeah, mate, there's the shag pad,
there you go, brother, you have it.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.440
Let's go in it.

41:00.520 --> 41:04.920
I'm finally in the shag pad
and me balls are ready to burst.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.080
Come to Daddy.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.520
Aaron's throwing
Scott's clothes everywhere.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.840
Wouldn't like to be Scott
in the morning.

41:13.920 --> 41:14.920
Fucking prick.

41:18.280 --> 41:22.280
Little Scotty T is finally taking
a dip and it feels absolutely mint.

41:22.360 --> 41:25.120
I think me little rascal might even
pick himself up

41:25.200 --> 41:28.040
a paddy diving licence
for maximum depth.

41:29.160 --> 41:33.080
Fuck this, I'm pissed and I'm angry
and all I need to do is get to bed.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.960
I'll deal with that dickhead
in the morning.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.680
I'm on a pure mission tonight, me.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.280
This turbo dick
has got a full fucking charge.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.040
Scotty T is back.

41:49.120 --> 41:51.560
(girl moans)
Again?

41:51.760 --> 41:51.960
.
