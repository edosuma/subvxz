00:00.010 --> 00:05.390
We had a gang, my pals and me.
Will, Elly, Sean and Milly.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.520
You have to put things right.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.350
Because of what you did.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.230
- I want to talk about what's
really happening. - Which is?

00:14.280 --> 00:15.870
About your being raped.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.670
- Just leave me alone.
- Stop trying to save her.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.310
I don't know how to do that.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.230
- You're here with me.
- Why haven't the police arrested him yet?

00:23.280 --> 00:24.350
- He's protected.
- By who?

00:24.400 --> 00:26.590
Businesspeople, politicians, the police...

00:26.640 --> 00:28.470
DS Tom Gillespie.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.150
I'm Rory's handler.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.790
You belong to Alistair.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.150
I let him know about the
police investigation.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.870
I'm worried about her. She
could be in actual danger.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.190
Maybe she likes it.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.990
You could have just left it alone!

00:45.560 --> 00:47.390
♪ You

00:47.440 --> 00:51.990
♪ You have me hooked again
and now I have no choice

00:52.040 --> 00:54.350
♪ But to follow

00:54.400 --> 00:57.110
♪ I'm sinking faster

00:57.160 --> 00:59.390

00:59.440 --> 01:05.319

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:36.200 --> 01:37.920
Stop it!

02:04.960 --> 02:07.070
We need to go.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.240
Holly. It's OK.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.120
Are you ready to talk?

03:47.680 --> 03:50.520
I can't take it -- not
knowing what's in your head.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.360
You kept going.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.600
You kept hitting him.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.630
You weren't breathing.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.910
And he wasn't going to stop.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.000
I had to make him stop.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.350
I made a choice. For you.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.520
I think you'd have done the same.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.760
I know you would.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.960
Someone will find him.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.600
I know.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.640
So we need to go to the police.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.560
We need to tell them what happened.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.470
I don't think that's a good idea.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.800
But if that's what you want...

04:45.040 --> 04:46.800
What other choice have we got?

04:48.920 --> 04:51.550
Then we need to be ready
for what's coming.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.110
I'll go to prison. You will, too.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.030
- We'll explain what happened.
- Rory worked for the police.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.190
You think they're just going
to take our word for it?

04:59.240 --> 05:01.940
- He told me what he did to James.
- He's dead, Holly.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.760
I'm sorry.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.520
We need someone to help us.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.520
It's just us now.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.520
Till we can work out what to do.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.240
If we can prove it...

05:38.640 --> 05:41.040
.. what Alistair did,
what Rory did, then...

05:42.040 --> 05:44.160
.. maybe we can make them believe us.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.680
Maybe.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.840
This doesn't feel real.

05:58.840 --> 06:02.160
It's good to see you,
Ruth, in spite of all this.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.470
You understand why you're here?

06:05.520 --> 06:07.870
Of course.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.590
The media, I could probably handle.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.550
But the parents are calling in now.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.710
Every kid with a conditional
offer for next year.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.790
- The department's in freefall.
- The initiative was mine.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.030
It existed outside Solasta.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.190
And I was behind you, Jude, you know that.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.110
I wanted the scheme to work.

06:24.160 --> 06:28.150
I was fighting for those girls
to realise their full potential.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.550
But it didn't work out
like that, though, did it?

06:30.600 --> 06:33.500
The press are calling you
a pimp for your brother.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.790
I didn't know.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.240
I know that, Jude, but
maybe you SHOULD have.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.270
This isn't just about
what he's done, is it?

06:44.320 --> 06:45.590
You were teaching those girls

06:45.640 --> 06:48.150
something some of them were
not equipped to understand.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.710
I was teaching them to be pragmatic.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.280
And it backfired.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.400
Those girls got hurt.

06:57.640 --> 07:00.470
- I want you to let me put this right.
- Oh, for God's sake.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.920
I am firing you, Jude.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.640
All right.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.750
Holly.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.550
What are you doing?

07:30.600 --> 07:33.310
- Going to Solasta.
- Why?

07:33.360 --> 07:36.110
If I can get to Alistair, I can
get him to tell me what he did.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.030
- What he made Rory do.
- You can't leave me here.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.350
You said.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.030
You said this was the only way.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.550
I can't...

07:42.600 --> 07:44.240
I can't do it. I can't.

07:47.680 --> 07:52.280
Don't make me do this whole thing
by myself. I need you to help me.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.270
Isn't your first exam today?

07:57.320 --> 07:58.950
What?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.630
Put some clothes on and go and take it.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.980
It'll stop people coming looking for us.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.120
Hey.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.840
We said we'd be brave, didn't we?

08:34.280 --> 08:37.070
- 'Who is it?'
- Elizabeth Smith.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.549
I'm a student on your
macroeconomics module.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.360
'Not any more.'

08:47.240 --> 08:49.310
That was very rude.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.870
'What do you want?'

08:50.920 --> 08:52.480
Your time.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.000
I deserve it, too.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.590
And I know things.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.520
Things you should know.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.320
Well?

09:16.440 --> 09:19.750
I should tell you I'm the one who
put that video on in your lecture.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.920
Do you want a sticker(?)

09:23.680 --> 09:24.960
Didn't even work.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.400
Nothing happened to Alistair.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.910
And now Holly's gone with her.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.640
With who?

09:45.240 --> 09:47.830
I can tell you what you
got in your Highers.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.990
I can tell you the name
of your first boyfriend.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.400
I know your dad wished you were a boy.

09:54.680 --> 09:57.550
I can't tell you anything
about Rachel Maddox

09:57.600 --> 09:59.400
before she came to this uni.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.160
She doesn't exist.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.800
Thought I knew her.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.320
Been wrong about a lot this year.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.910
Come on, then, you tell me.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.470
What's she doing?

10:16.520 --> 10:18.320
Rachel won't leave Holly alone.

10:18.840 --> 10:22.840
I know she makes Holly... do
things she wouldn't normally do.

10:27.600 --> 10:32.920
Rachel side-stepped me to get
Georgia onto the scheme, not Holly.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.760
Where Georgia goes, Holly will follow.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.200
Look, Holly's been getting messages.

10:42.720 --> 10:47.160
It's how she got the
corruption stuff in Fay's video.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.000
But when Rachel saw it,
she wasn't surprised.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.960
It's like she knew.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.880
Like she'd already seen it.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.470
Where have you been?

11:12.520 --> 11:15.590
Bit of drama and everyone
goes AWOL. It's pathetic.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.630
Don't lump me in with everyone else.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.670
- It's offensive. - Yeah, well,
I appreciate it. - You should.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.390
I saved your skin with Fay, didn't I?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.470
Why you bringing that up?

11:25.520 --> 11:27.480
It's relevant, isn't it?

11:28.840 --> 11:31.270
Well, only if you allow
yourself to be whipped up

11:31.320 --> 11:33.510
by a couple of mad
bitches with a vendetta.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.260
I think we're way beyond
"a couple of mad bitches".

11:38.000 --> 11:39.520
What's wrong with you?

11:46.680 --> 11:49.070
It's been nice.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.280
I liked helping you.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.480
What the fuck, Rach? I don't have
time for this shit right now.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.750
Holly's got it all.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.470
Steiner, the fraud, the accounts.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.480
She worked it all out. Just like Fay.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.110
Is this a joke, or...?

12:13.160 --> 12:15.360
Don't worry. I can help you.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.190
But I need you to do something for me.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.280
Aww. This is precious.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.790
Are you actually attempting
to threaten me here?

12:26.840 --> 12:29.280
- Not at all.
- I suggest you stop.

12:30.480 --> 12:35.550
You see, I don't care about
your stupid little friend

12:35.600 --> 12:37.310
and what she thinks she knows,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.790
and I certainly don't care
that you woke up this morning

12:39.840 --> 12:41.310
and lost your fucking mind.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.280
There's a flat, Alistair.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.830
Belonged to Fay and James.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.440
No-one knew about it.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.470
It's full of things about you.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.720
All their hard work.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.310
Does seem a bit weird, doesn't it,

13:00.360 --> 13:02.320
them both being dead?

13:03.320 --> 13:04.790
I can give you the address.

13:04.840 --> 13:08.550
Give you a chance to go
and sort a few things out.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.830
Or I could give that
address to the police,

13:10.880 --> 13:12.750
let them decide what to do with it.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.630
Why are you doing this?

13:14.680 --> 13:16.680
Because you stopped being useful.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.590
And I got bored.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.030
I swear to God, if this gets out...

13:26.080 --> 13:28.470
Come on. You don't do this part, remember?

13:28.520 --> 13:30.710
That was what Rory was for.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.950
Oh, and he left.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.960
So no protection from the
police investigation either.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.870
What do you want?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.950
You should probably leave Edinburgh.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.350
There's nothing I can do about
the fraud investigation.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.440
That's on its way regardless.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.830
I'm taking the beach house.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.230
I always liked it there.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.160
Don't go back. OK?

13:58.480 --> 13:59.750
Oh, yeah --

13:59.800 --> 14:01.320
Fay's flat keys.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.400
Bye, boss.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.560
Eyes on your papers, please.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.670
- Holly, I need to talk to you.
- No.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.430
These messages that you've been getting,

15:55.480 --> 15:57.070
you know who's sending them?

15:57.120 --> 15:58.550
None of that matters any more.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.070
Whatever you are doing, you have to stop.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.230
Where's Rachel?

16:03.280 --> 16:05.000
I'm fine, Jude. I'm all right.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.270
- DS Gillespie.
- 'Hello.'

16:50.320 --> 16:52.990
You need to come. I don't know what to do.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.430
Wait, slow down.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.550
Tell me your name.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.590
What's the address?

17:02.640 --> 17:05.359
- '.. apartment by The Shore.'
- Uh-huh.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.440
Hello...?

18:12.480 --> 18:14.240
Oh, fuck!

18:18.520 --> 18:20.990
Oh, no!

18:21.040 --> 18:23.830
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

18:23.880 --> 18:25.680
Oh, Jesus!

18:29.200 --> 18:30.670
I don't know what happened.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.230
Stay where you are, McDermid.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.030
I was sent here.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.560
I didn't touch him.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.110
Who are you?

18:45.160 --> 18:48.720
Did you come back for
these... or to clear up?

18:49.680 --> 18:51.160
I didn't do this.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.870
You've bought your way
out of every single charge

18:54.920 --> 18:57.350
I've come close to getting
you on for two years.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.590
Not any more, you
arrogant prick. It's over.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.230
No, no, no. Listen to me.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.870
I was sent here by a woman
called Rachel Maddox.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.790
She set me up. She's fucking mental.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.390
- No, you found out
Rory was with us. - No.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.910
Did you think killing him was
going to make everything go away?

19:10.960 --> 19:13.660
- Just listen to me for a...
- Shut up! Stop talking!

19:22.080 --> 19:23.910
What's YOUR name?

19:23.960 --> 19:25.680
Mm?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.320
Fuck you.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.080
Where you going?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.400
Move.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.680
Move!

19:44.240 --> 19:46.030
You fucking...

19:51.880 --> 19:53.150
I need a unit.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.430
'Go ahead.'

19:54.480 --> 19:57.390
24 Tyrell Street. Flat 5/1.

19:58.640 --> 19:59.760
Move it.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.470
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.950
Thank God you're here.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.400
Everyone in there's so fucking miserable.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.870
What are you making?

20:16.920 --> 20:18.590
I want a blue cocktail.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.640
I don't know what makes one
of those, but I'm having one.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.590
- Are you in?
- Sure.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.070
I'll be back in a sec.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.470
Sorry. Came as quickly as I could.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.550
Babe, you look rough.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.310
We don't know what to do
with her. She's not packed.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.390
Yeah, and she's definitely
taken something.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.760
- I'll deal with it.
- How?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.630
She just needs to sober up.
I'll put her to bed for a bit.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.430
And then what? You guys have got
to be out of here by the morning,

20:46.480 --> 20:47.750
and she's not staying at mine.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.000
- It's fine, honestly.
- It's not fine, Rachel, none of it's fine.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.230
- Are you going to come
to Charlie's? - No.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.590
Me and Holly are going to
leave town for a few days.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.190
And go where?

20:59.240 --> 21:01.150
She just needs to get
away from all of this.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.510
New best buds, then.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.030
- Is she OK?
- Why do you care so much?

21:06.080 --> 21:07.510
She's just destroyed everything.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.070
Don't get pulled back into this shit.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.430
Look, guys -- we're done, all right?

21:11.480 --> 21:13.790
Rachel, you're welcome at mine, but...

21:13.840 --> 21:16.000
just don't bring her like that. OK?

21:19.120 --> 21:21.870
Holly won't go with you, you know.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.440
She won't leave her.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.480
She will.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.760
Come on, darling. Time to go.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.470
- Where?
- Alistair's.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.310
- He's been asking for you.
- Did you speak to him?

21:50.360 --> 21:52.710
I've tried calling, but
I couldn't get through.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.430
I thought he was angry with me.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.830
He's upset, but not with you.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.240
He needs you.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.680
You keep trying to help, but
you just make things worse.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.120
Tell me what to do.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.440
I'm dead, Holly. I can't
tell you anything.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.820
There's something wrong with me.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.910
People always get hurt.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.680
Bit narcissistic, isn't it?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.350
Rory, Georgia...

23:08.400 --> 23:09.760
Lisa?

23:12.680 --> 23:14.950
Is that really true?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.430
I mean, you were a little girl,

23:16.480 --> 23:19.230
you played a stupid prank that went wrong.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.360
- Did you mean to hurt her?
- No.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.920
No.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.960
You have to forgive yourself.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.030
I can't.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.280
Why not? She did.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.280
Georgia.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.640
Fay, wait.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.120
I need you to tell me what to do.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.710
You don't get it yet.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.360
But you will.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.320
You're perfect.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.230
'Holly.'

24:32.280 --> 24:33.750
Where are you?

24:33.800 --> 24:35.430
What's going on?

24:35.480 --> 24:38.590
'Meet me in The Windsor.
I'll be there in an hour.'

24:38.640 --> 24:40.350
I can't stand it any more.

24:40.400 --> 24:44.320
'It's OK. I'm on my way back.
I'll explain everything.'

25:23.240 --> 25:25.510
It's OK.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.710
You're OK.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.670
What's happening?

25:29.720 --> 25:32.360
In a sec. I need to tell you something.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.240
Sit down.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.030
What did you feel?

25:47.080 --> 25:49.070
When?

25:49.120 --> 25:51.230
When I did it.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.960
- When I killed Rory.
- Stop it.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.000
Did you feel it here?

25:58.920 --> 26:02.950
Kind of like... a vibration, like...

26:03.000 --> 26:05.160
the second before you come, you know.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.960
- I know you felt it.
- What are you saying?

26:10.480 --> 26:12.630
It's over, Holly.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.160
We made it.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.470
Now it's only Georgia in the way,

26:17.520 --> 26:19.280
just like Lisa was.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.230
What do you want?

26:25.280 --> 26:26.990
Come on, Holly.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.720
You still don't remember?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.870
Remember what?

26:31.920 --> 26:33.840
I've been trying to remind you.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.710
But it's OK.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.590
I'll save you, like you saved me.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.880
Let go.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.790
Milly?

27:10.840 --> 27:12.080
Yes!

27:13.280 --> 27:15.790
'Holly!'

27:15.840 --> 27:17.590
Holly! Milly!

27:17.640 --> 27:19.270
She's going to stalk us.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.950
She's so weird.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.030
If she finds us, we get infected.

27:23.080 --> 27:26.350
- We're going to have to
live here... - Forever.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.880
You were so powerful.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.260
You were the most powerful
girl I'd ever known.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.920
I was so scared of who I was.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.280
You made it OK.

27:45.320 --> 27:46.710
For the first time in my life

27:46.760 --> 27:49.510
I knew there were other people like me,

27:49.560 --> 27:51.060
because YOU were like me.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.950
Have you forgotten?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.680
That's so sad, Holly.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.430
Lisa has to do it.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.000
Yeah.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.190
What are you doing?

28:10.240 --> 28:12.880
I've been getting you to the right place.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.800
'Get in. I like it when you're happy.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.190
'You're here with me.

28:21.240 --> 28:24.310
'Stop trying to say you're so powerful.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.630
'I'm with you, Holly. Maybe
you need to let her go.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.560
'You're here at last.'

28:37.040 --> 28:41.230
I tried to remind you with
Fay, but... it didn't work.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.990
We weren't together.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.540
I think we need to be
together when they die.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.990
Sending you her stupid research
and video was the long way round,

28:51.040 --> 28:53.270
but... it worked.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.630
Someone's sending me things.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.310
These messages that you've been getting --

28:57.360 --> 28:58.710
you know who sent them, don't you?

28:58.760 --> 29:00.400
You get it now?

29:02.440 --> 29:04.120
You killed her.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.640
She was ready to go.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.550
She did the first one herself.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.500
I just... gave her a little push.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.830
It's your turn now.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.480
You need to let Georgia go.

29:23.080 --> 29:26.400
It's OK to be scared. I'll help you.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.430
It's just us now.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.840
You understand?

29:33.280 --> 29:34.640
Where's Georgia?

29:35.880 --> 29:38.630
I'm only taking you if you're ready.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.760
If you want to see her, come with me.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.440
She's waiting for us.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.400
Come on.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.720
'Jude.'

30:20.280 --> 30:21.910
What do you want, Al?

30:21.960 --> 30:23.400
Rory's dead.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.440
'Murdered.'

30:26.840 --> 30:29.110
They've arrested me for it.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.110
Did you do it?

30:34.160 --> 30:37.830
Do you honestly think I'm capable of that?

30:37.880 --> 30:40.750
She came to the office, she...

30:40.800 --> 30:43.990
She threatened me. She was fucking insane.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.080
She set me up.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.880
Rachel.

30:49.920 --> 30:53.550
I think Rachel killed Rory, Jude.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.710
'You created her.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.510
'She helped you to ruin people.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.670
'What is she doing?'

30:58.720 --> 31:00.510
'I swear, I don't know.'

31:00.560 --> 31:01.910
'What does she want?'

31:01.960 --> 31:03.630
'I don't know.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.550
'My money, maybe.'

31:05.600 --> 31:07.150
I've got no idea.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.230
She took the keys to the beach house.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.270
What?!

31:10.320 --> 31:14.470
'Jude, please, please,
please, just come down here.

31:14.520 --> 31:17.670
'Come down here and
tell me what you know.'

31:17.720 --> 31:19.390
I didn't do this.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.350
She's dangerous, Al.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.110
So come and help me. Get
down here and help me.

31:24.160 --> 31:26.870
'Jude...'

31:27.420 --> 31:28.240
Jude?

31:35.800 --> 31:39.150
What did you give her?
She might have overdosed.

31:39.200 --> 31:43.640
There you go again, still feeling
responsible for her weakness.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.790
That was the saddest part
about seeing you again.

31:48.840 --> 31:52.350
Seeing how unlike yourself she'd made you.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.830
- You know the real me.
- Yes.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.200
Why are you here?

31:58.600 --> 32:00.760
- I don't want you here.
- Tell the truth.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.440
You're ruining this for me.

32:05.480 --> 32:08.510
You're jealous. You don't
want me to be happy.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.480
She's not like you, is she, Holly?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.230
No.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.750
She's a liability. Never
able to take care of herself.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.830
Always looking to you to sort things out.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.480
You resent that, don't you?

32:25.480 --> 32:27.910
Yes.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.800
I hate you.

32:34.560 --> 32:37.270
You're going to do it
again. Just like last time.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.800
You'll feel better afterwards, I promise.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.760
'Hi, this is Holly's phone, I can't...'

33:00.680 --> 33:04.480
'You've reached Georgia
Cunningham. I'm unable...'

33:25.320 --> 33:29.590
It's almost the same as home, isn't it?

33:29.640 --> 33:32.270
It's beautiful, don't you think?

33:32.320 --> 33:35.150
What's happening?

33:35.200 --> 33:40.240
We can get it back. That
feeling we have together.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.360
When you're ready.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.830
What are you doing?

33:48.880 --> 33:51.120
Holly, what's she doing?

33:52.880 --> 33:53.920
Just like before.

34:03.480 --> 34:04.990
Make her stop.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.840
It doesn't work like that
any more, George. Look.

34:08.960 --> 34:13.270
Go on, Holly, do it. Make me stop.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.440
- No, Milly.
- You see?

34:18.840 --> 34:20.239
Turn around.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.120
Turn around!

34:26.400 --> 34:30.080
This is it. You're free,
Holly. We're free.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.920
Swim, Georgia. Swim.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.430
Why did you do that?

37:09.480 --> 37:11.720
You're going to stop now, Rachel.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.760
- But you're like me.
- Maybe once, but not any more.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.160
Why do you love her?

37:25.800 --> 37:27.680
Because she saved me.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.640
Because she saved me from you.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.480
(Do it.)

38:28.240 --> 38:30.670
'They're sending me to live with my dad.'

38:30.720 --> 38:32.870
Don't forget about me, OK?

38:32.920 --> 38:34.390
I'm so sorry.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.120
Milly, come on.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.760
Who was that?

38:43.400 --> 38:44.710
No-one.

38:44.760 --> 38:45.960
'Holly!'

38:49.560 --> 38:50.920
Holly!

40:30.640 --> 40:34.790
I knew it. We're not even
in the same tutorial group.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.270
We live together, Elizabeth.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.830
You're not going to miss me that much.

40:38.880 --> 40:42.470
That's not what I meant, I meant
for covering each other's absences.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.310
When was your last absence?

40:44.360 --> 40:45.950
Primary 2.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.350
Wow.

40:47.400 --> 40:48.700
I had the chickenpox.

40:50.480 --> 40:54.110
Oh, are we still on for Strictly
and hot Vimto party later?

40:54.160 --> 40:56.270
I'm going to drink wine...

40:56.320 --> 40:57.430
but yeah.

40:57.480 --> 41:00.520
And do you think... THEY'LL be joining us?

41:01.600 --> 41:04.630
You should go down and hang out
with them, they're not that bad.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.710
Yeah, well...

41:06.760 --> 41:08.150
time will tell.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.800
Right, I won't be long.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.510
Adorable.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.670
Are you guys going to get dressed today?

41:17.720 --> 41:19.590
Job doesn't start till next week.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.390
I'm leaning towards hottest
kept woman as a career.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.710
She just got accepted on to her master's.

41:24.760 --> 41:26.350
Congrats.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.590
Are you going out?

41:27.640 --> 41:29.710
Yeah, I'm going to go
meet my dad for lunch.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.950
I'll be back in a bit.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.320
Have fun.

41:39.640 --> 41:40.670
Hey.

41:40.720 --> 41:41.760
Hi.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.630
Louise asked me over.

41:45.680 --> 41:47.840
Yeah, of course. Come in.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.790
I don't really know what
I'm going to say to them.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.630
It's hard for everyone
right now. Don't worry.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.880
Yeah.

42:02.880 --> 42:04.830
How have you been?

42:04.880 --> 42:06.550
OK.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.630
It's good to get home for a bit.

42:08.680 --> 42:11.350
I'm going to retake the term.

42:11.400 --> 42:12.560
Cool.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.550
Different course.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.800
Good shout.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.670
Were you just leaving?

42:19.720 --> 42:23.390
Yeah, erm... I'm just going out for
a bit, but I'll be back later on.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.790
If you're hanging about, we...

42:24.840 --> 42:26.070
Yeah, cool, we should...

42:26.120 --> 42:27.870
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.750
Hey, George.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.760
- Hey.
- Come up.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.510
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:47.560 --> 42:49.670
How are you?

42:49.720 --> 42:52.830
Good. Just moved into a new house.

42:52.880 --> 42:53.920
First term down.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.950
You?

42:57.000 --> 42:59.390
I think it'll take a while.

42:59.440 --> 43:00.680
Maybe it should.

43:01.720 --> 43:02.960
Yeah.

43:05.880 --> 43:08.550
I wish we'd had more time to talk.
I want to tell you how sorry...

43:08.600 --> 43:10.800
You don't need it, Jude.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.230
I'm fine. We're...

43:14.280 --> 43:15.600
We're all fine.

43:18.280 --> 43:19.360
I'm going to...

43:25.800 --> 43:28.680
You should come back to work, Professor.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.160
Hi.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.120
Hi.
