-What? I thought you

-What do you want?
-Your nightmares, they're
giving me such power.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.850
One more little

That creature stopped Luke
telling us about him
but Luke's clever.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.585
He didn't record that video
because he was scared
but because he knew

05:52.652 --> 05:54.153
we'd find it,
and he knew we'd save him.

07:14.801 --> 07:15.935
Go easy on the sauce.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.708
I don't get it. Where's Luke?

07:22.775 --> 07:26.012
Oh, he's such a clever boy.
He's working
for the government now.

07:26.078 --> 07:27.880
Says he's going
to be an astronaut.

07:29.982 --> 07:31.818
I went to space once.

07:31.884 --> 07:35.955
-Yeah, with the Doctor.
-Oh, I told you?

07:37.490 --> 07:39.258
I get confused.

07:39.325 --> 07:42.128
The social reckon
I'm losing it.
They want to put me in a home!

07:42.195 --> 07:43.863

08:34.447 --> 08:36.816
I have stuff here from planets

<i>Imagine a red door, come on!</i>

14:40.813 --> 14:42.915
<i>You can do it, I know you can.</i>

14:45.017 --> 14:47.953
<i>Focus. Keep focusing</i>
<i>on the door.</i>

14:53.892 --> 14:54.927
<i>Focus!</i>

14:56.695 --> 14:58.097
It's working!

15:02.601 --> 15:03.836
I've done it!

15:03.902 --> 15:06.905
Breaking news, Rani.
Luke's leaving you.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.174
He's got his A-levels
and he's going to university.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.544
-He's leaving you behind.
-I know!

15:12.611 --> 15:14.613
Then why do you do
what he tells you to?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.815
Stay with me, Rani,
be a journalist.

15:16.882 --> 15:18.951
I'll give you everything
you've ever wanted.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.954
Stay here.
You made a door appear!

15:22.021 --> 15:26.091
You could make money, gold,
everything you've ever wanted.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.129
LUKE: <i>Clyde? Rani?</i>

15:31.697 --> 15:34.933
Please! I need you.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.938
Breaking news.
I'm out of here.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.078
Clyde? Come on!

15:49.615 --> 15:50.916
I quit.

16:00.526 --> 16:01.927
We did it!

16:06.298 --> 16:07.433
What?

16:07.499 --> 16:10.769
No. No, that isn't possible!

16:12.838 --> 16:13.906
Ah!

16:15.841 --> 16:18.077
They're together!

16:22.281 --> 16:26.051
Are we... Are we all having
the same dream?

16:26.118 --> 16:28.787
-That's impossible.
-That's amazing!

16:28.854 --> 16:30.622
I guess we're just that good.

16:31.857 --> 16:34.126
But... Where are we?

16:34.193 --> 16:37.496
Mr Smith told K9 about
this different dimension.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.598
I think it's where our minds
go when we dream.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.967
<i>Reminder, we need to defeat</i>
<i>The Nightmare Man.</i>

16:42.968 --> 16:43.936
The what now?

16:49.408 --> 16:50.642
Bad dog!

16:54.646 --> 16:55.781
K9!

17:09.161 --> 17:13.132
No help for you,
Sarah Jane Smith.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.435
You must be alone,

17:16.502 --> 17:20.939
with a little hint
of moonlight on your face.

17:22.074 --> 17:22.974
Here, boy!

17:25.377 --> 17:27.579
Something must have
happened to the real K9.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.150
-Mum.
-Hey, she'll be okay.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.918
She's brilliant, your mum.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.686
You haven't seen him, Rani.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.088
You don't know what he's like.

17:38.824 --> 17:41.794
Good to meet you at last.

17:43.095 --> 17:45.197
You know me?

17:45.264 --> 17:48.567
I feed on every nightmare

17:48.634 --> 17:53.539
that every man, woman
and child has ever had.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.174
And you have had so many.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.377
Oh, the things you have seen.

17:58.444 --> 18:01.013
And Luke, your fear
about what might
happen to him.

18:01.079 --> 18:04.750
And the dreams
about the Doctor,
when he never came back

18:04.817 --> 18:06.585
and you thought he was dead.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.254
Oh, they were good!

18:12.057 --> 18:14.593
I'm not scared of you.

18:14.660 --> 18:18.464
What's wrong?
Not used to someone
arguing back?

18:18.530 --> 18:20.632
What's the matter?
If you're so strong,

18:20.699 --> 18:22.301
send me to sleep.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.970
You want to have nightmares?

18:25.170 --> 18:28.173
You've already taken
my son. My friends.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.977
This is already a nightmare!
What else have I got live for?

18:34.079 --> 18:35.881
Oh, come on, do it!

18:38.650 --> 18:42.621
You think
if I send you to sleep,
you'll be able to join Luke.

18:42.688 --> 18:48.260
Oh, and I almost fell for it.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.062
RANI: So, what do we do?

18:50.128 --> 18:51.630
I don't know.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.632
Look, it's okay, we're here.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.133
(RANI'S VOICE ECHOING)

18:55.200 --> 18:56.768
(GROANS)

18:56.835 --> 19:00.606
Why am I wasting my
time with you, old woman?

19:00.672 --> 19:02.407
They're still together.

19:02.474 --> 19:06.979
-I can feel them.
-They're still together,
even in their dreams.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.181
And that's what's hurting you.

19:09.248 --> 19:14.386
To be scared,
he needs to be alone.

19:14.453 --> 19:15.954
And he will be alone.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.423
Forever!

19:18.490 --> 19:20.459
No! No, no, no, no, no,
come back!

19:20.526 --> 19:23.795
No! Come back! Come back!

19:26.365 --> 19:27.566
What the hell are you?

19:27.633 --> 19:30.435
I am The Nightmare Man.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.372
And you two
are going to suffer!

19:33.438 --> 19:36.008
You're just an alien.
We can stop you.

19:36.074 --> 19:37.509
THE NIGHTMARE MAN:
You're nothing.

19:37.576 --> 19:41.547
You're pathetic children,
scared of the dark.

19:41.613 --> 19:45.117
-Scared of me.
-Luke...

19:45.183 --> 19:46.184
Do something!

19:48.720 --> 19:51.790
You're going back
into your nightmares.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.091
Get away from us!

19:56.762 --> 20:00.933
And you're going to be locked
in them forever.

20:04.703 --> 20:09.074
Trapped for all eternity!

<i>You're coming back to me.</i>

<i>Oh, Clyde,</i>
<i>you're so stupid!</i>

20:15.213 --> 20:17.916
Night, night, children.

20:18.917 --> 20:19.885
No!

20:21.453 --> 20:25.157
Oh, your nightmares
haven't even begun!

20:25.223 --> 20:27.893
-LUKE: Just listen to me.
-Why?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.495
'Cause you keep telling me
about you and what you want.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.863
You've never asked about me.

20:31.930 --> 20:36.068
(LAUGHS)
What are you talking about?

20:36.134 --> 20:38.904
But you're just an alien.
Well, I'm called Luke Smith.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.073
I was made by aliens
to destroy the world.

20:41.139 --> 20:44.576
But this brilliant woman,
Sarah Jane Smith,
she found me.

20:44.643 --> 20:47.312
And she made me good.

20:47.379 --> 20:51.016
And she found others.
A boy called Clyde.
And a girl called Rani.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.851
This world has faced
so many nightmares

20:52.918 --> 20:56.455
but there's always
been someone
there to stop them. Us!

20:56.521 --> 20:58.490
You know
I was so scared because
I thought my mates

20:58.557 --> 21:00.993
wouldn't be there for me.
Never mind Oxford,

21:01.059 --> 21:02.828
they followed me
into my nightmares!

21:02.894 --> 21:05.831
Three kids breaking down
the walls of dreams
to be together.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.699
Something no one's
ever done before.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.935
Because together,
we're unbeatable!

21:10.802 --> 21:11.803
Oh!

21:13.372 --> 21:16.975
Very good. But do you
really think words

21:17.042 --> 21:19.945
can stop a creature like me?

21:21.813 --> 21:23.582
I wasn't talking to you.

21:26.918 --> 21:27.886
He's right.

21:30.422 --> 21:34.426
-Because together,
we stop the monsters.
-RANI: We stop the nightmares.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.228
Because when we're together,

21:36.294 --> 21:39.865
we're not scared.
You've got no hold
over us now.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.933
'Cause we're brilliant
when we're together.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.970
Get away from me!

21:45.170 --> 21:46.738
So, there we go.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.874
The boy that was
made by aliens
to destroy the world

21:48.940 --> 21:50.542
saves the world yet again.

22:00.585 --> 22:02.754
Oh, hello, love.

22:07.392 --> 22:11.129
No! I can't be trapped here.

22:11.196 --> 22:12.931
This can't happen to me!

22:17.235 --> 22:18.537
Let me out!

22:19.738 --> 22:21.573
Children of Earth,

22:21.640 --> 22:26.945
I demand you sleep
and you dream and you fear.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.248
You will fear me!

22:30.315 --> 22:32.184
Come on. Come and sit down.

22:32.250 --> 22:35.754
And I'll tell you all about
my brilliant son.

22:35.821 --> 22:38.824
-No.
-His name's Luke Smith.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.693
And he's going to live
happily ever after.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.695
No!

22:44.963 --> 22:46.665
-You did it.
-No.

22:46.732 --> 22:47.766
We did it.

22:49.134 --> 22:51.737
-Now, let's get out of here.
-Yeah.

22:51.803 --> 22:54.039
-Time to wake up.
-How?

22:55.574 --> 22:57.142
Ow!

Oh, I thought I'd lost you.

You're never,
ever going to lose me.

check on the others.

<i>Mistress?</i>

24:10.415 --> 24:13.018
For years, you were
pretty much all I had.

24:13.084 --> 24:15.387
A metal dog looking after me.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.455
But you see, he's my son.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.925
And he's going off
on a big new adventure and

24:21.126 --> 24:22.661
so are you.

-Rani...
-Yeah?

24:34.206 --> 24:35.841
In my nightmares,
you were...

24:37.976 --> 24:39.444
I think you were
jealous of me.

24:40.278 --> 24:42.180
-I am.
-What?

24:42.247 --> 24:44.115
Of course I'm jealous.

24:44.182 --> 24:47.152
You're doing everything
I want to do.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.120
But don't for one minute think
I'm not pleased for you.

24:50.355 --> 24:53.158
I couldn't be happier.
Come here.

25:00.699 --> 25:01.766
