00:13.972 --> 00:15.807
I'm Jimmy DiResta, and I'm a maker.

00:15.890 --> 00:18.601
That's a hip way of saying
I make things… like this.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.811
Pretty cool, right?

00:20.520 --> 00:21.354
Walk with me.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.858
For years, I made my name
as a toy designer in New York City.

00:24.941 --> 00:28.570
Then I realized I don't like the city,
I don't like designing toys,

00:28.653 --> 00:31.406
and to be honest with you,
I don't really like kids.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.116
It's not like I hate them or anything.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.744
It's just it's,
"Check out my little Timmy."

00:35.827 --> 00:36.703
I don't care.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.246
Look at my birds.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.083
So anyway, I quit my job,

00:42.167 --> 00:45.420
I left the city,
and I moved upstate to here, my farm.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.922
I got land, I got animals,

00:48.590 --> 00:50.759
and best of all, I have this!

00:50.842 --> 00:53.219
The ultimate maker workshop!

00:53.720 --> 00:58.141
Inside, I have every kind of tool
and machine imaginable to make things.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.019
Pretty impressive stuff, huh?

01:02.103 --> 01:05.482
Really? You're labeling the table
like that's some sort of impress--

01:05.565 --> 01:07.067
"Bag"? We can just--

01:07.150 --> 01:09.527
Okay. Graphics guy trying to be funny.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.030
Can we please get on with it? Anyway…

01:12.113 --> 01:15.075
So I got a call to be on a TV show
'cause I'm a maker celebrity or whatever.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.368
I said, "Sure. Cool." Why not, right?

01:17.452 --> 01:18.578
So I agreed.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.206
Then I found out who I'd be working for.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.207
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:22.290 --> 01:23.625
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hi!</i>

01:23.708 --> 01:24.626
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:24.709 --> 01:25.543
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:26.753
What do you want?

01:26.836 --> 01:28.630
<i>Okay, Mr. Grouch.</i>

01:29.839 --> 01:34.302
Thirty years of expert build experience,
and I'm taking orders from half-pints.

01:34.385 --> 01:37.764
And because misery loves company,
I brought my buddies in on it with me.

01:37.847 --> 01:38.681
Say hi, guys.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.641
-Howdy!
-Hello!

01:39.724 --> 01:42.727
That's Jackman.
He's an engineer, and he plans everything.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.938
It's really annoying, but he's good at it.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.981
That's Derek, my best friend.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.692
Big guy and even bigger softie.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.653
This is Graz.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.530
Good maker, bad jokes.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.073
And Canadian Pat.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.618
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

01:58.701 --> 01:59.702
Let's have some fun.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.667
Together, we'll take pitches on this.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.419
Listen to whatever
their dumb little brains come up with.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.672
<i>The Pig Tripper. It trips the pig.</i>

02:10.755 --> 02:13.424
-Wow.
So a catapult that throws cat poop?

02:13.508 --> 02:14.676
<i>-Yes.</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:18.471
If it's interesting or doable,
I'll build it! If not--

02:18.555 --> 02:19.514
Next!

02:19.597 --> 02:20.765
-Next!
<i>-No way.</i>

02:20.849 --> 02:22.392
-Next!
<i>-Shut up!</i>

02:22.475 --> 02:24.185
-Some builds will be good.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.104
Dino Taco Toilet.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.689
Are you not entertained?

02:27.772 --> 02:29.357
Some builds will be bad.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.693
Graz, I told you
the scissors were gonna be too heavy!

02:31.776 --> 02:32.819
Make a bigger handle!

02:32.902 --> 02:35.029
But all of them
will be absolutely pointless.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.157
-Yeah!
-<i>That is disgusting!</i>

02:38.408 --> 02:40.076
Whoa!

02:40.660 --> 02:43.872
-<i>I want the unicorn to fart!</i>
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.373
-Go, Graz!

02:46.124 --> 02:49.127
Why are we doing this?
Because we make things. That's what we do.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.172
-Thought we weren't supposed to have fun!
-I'm not having fun!

02:52.964 --> 02:54.966
We'll show these kids,
if they can dream it…

02:55.049 --> 02:58.052
<i>I want it to be a guitar boat that floats.</i>

02:58.136 --> 02:59.262
You're onto something there.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.930
…it can be built.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.266
<i>Oh!</i>

03:03.349 --> 03:04.934
<i>That is so cool!</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:07.020
Hey, it might even
inspire them to build

03:07.103 --> 03:09.189
outside their little <i>Minecraft</i> -y world,
or whatever.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.065
-Do I wanna do it?

03:11.149 --> 03:12.650
Dumbest thing we've ever made.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.820
Not really.
But this isn't about me, is it?

03:15.904 --> 03:18.031
-So here we are.
<i>-You better get to work!</i>

03:18.114 --> 03:20.325
Funny how their dreams are my nightmare.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.328
Come on, Jimmy. Have some fun.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.245
Whatever.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.761
You wanna give it a crack?

03:39.844 --> 03:41.346
I don't know what the word is.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.598
There's a couple of good clues in there.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.184
Yeah, but I don't know--

03:46.267 --> 03:48.603
Let's try again. What's it say, Derek?

03:48.686 --> 03:51.898
"Derek can't… Derek can't read"?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.402
All right.
We have a few pitches, gentlemen.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.363
Let's get ready
and listen to some pitches.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.367
And our first contestant,
come on down. Oh!

04:02.450 --> 04:03.326
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hi.</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:04.994
And what are your names?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.955
<i>Hudson. Henry.</i>

04:07.038 --> 04:08.373
Hudson and Henry.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.833
-I loved you in <i>Stranger Things.</i>

04:11.876 --> 04:13.211
What's your name, buddy?

04:13.294 --> 04:14.504
<i>Daniel.</i>

04:14.587 --> 04:17.840
Daniel, are you on a pixel cam?
How's 1980 doing?

04:17.924 --> 04:19.676
Be nice. Oh my God.

04:19.759 --> 04:20.927
What's your names, guys?

04:21.010 --> 04:23.221
<i>-My name is Kylie.</i>
<i>-My name is Courtney.</i>

04:23.304 --> 04:24.847
What do you guys do for a living?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.766
<i>I'm homeschooled,</i>

04:26.849 --> 04:29.769
<i>and I like playing dress-up.</i>

04:29.852 --> 04:31.312
So does Graz!

04:35.191 --> 04:37.568
All right. You got me here.
What is your pitch?

04:37.652 --> 04:42.657
<i>Our invention is a pair of skis</i>
<i>that are controlled by gloves.</i>

04:42.740 --> 04:47.287
<i>And the gloves control</i>
<i>backflips, frontflips, 360s--</i>

04:47.370 --> 04:49.289
So remote control skis?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.499
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-What is propelling them?

04:51.582 --> 04:52.959
<i>Um, like, engines.</i>

04:53.584 --> 04:55.044
<i>That go… </i>

04:55.545 --> 04:57.588
Give… Give me something good.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.259
<i>-This Butterfly Invention.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

05:01.342 --> 05:03.761
<i>It'll be a plain-looking box</i>
<i>with two passwords.</i>

05:03.845 --> 05:04.679
Okay.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.640
<i>Courtney's butterfly,</i>
<i>it makes popsicles inside of it.</i>

05:07.724 --> 05:09.642
It makes popsicles inside of it?

05:09.726 --> 05:12.270
-<i>Yes!</i>
<i>-Yes! Like this!</i>

05:12.937 --> 05:15.732
-Jeez! They already invented it.
-All right. Well…

05:15.815 --> 05:17.275
All right, whoa, I have to stop you.

05:17.358 --> 05:21.404
I have no idea
what the hell any of this means.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.033
<i>After Courtney puts her password,</i>
<i>she pushes a button--</i>

05:25.116 --> 05:26.117
This is my nightmare.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.413
<i>It is a life-sized board game</i>
<i>the size of my bedroom.</i>

05:30.997 --> 05:32.874
-Whoa, humongous.
-Oh.

05:32.957 --> 05:37.086
<i>And when you roll the dice,</i>
<i>then you have to go to the closest star,</i>

05:37.170 --> 05:42.008
<i>and then there will be your grandma there</i>
<i>trying to help you get through the maze.</i>

05:42.759 --> 05:45.511
-Could be nice. They're just kids.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.679
Interesting.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.931
Didn't expect that.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.392
Do you realize
you just invented a death trap?

05:51.476 --> 05:52.810
Rocket-propelled skis?

05:52.894 --> 05:56.356
<i>If you don't like it,</i>
<i>then why don't you make a comfort toy?</i>

05:57.648 --> 05:59.359
-I'm with these guys.
-Yeah.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.403
This… This is an insurance nightmare.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.946
<i>Kind of!</i>

06:05.073 --> 06:06.032
Next!

06:06.115 --> 06:08.034
<i>-No!</i>

06:08.117 --> 06:09.535
<i>If you land on a halo…</i>

06:09.619 --> 06:10.828
So, what do you guys think?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.164
-You wanna do a life-sized board game?
-No.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.248
Doesn't sound exciting.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.001
-Tough for travel.
-I'm gonna give you a gentle next.

06:17.085 --> 06:17.919
<i>Okay.</i>

06:18.002 --> 06:19.337
Aw!

06:19.420 --> 06:22.173
<i>Then, after you put the password in…</i>

06:22.256 --> 06:23.216
Oh my God.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.134
<i>Then crank it.</i>

06:25.218 --> 06:27.637
-Crank it like this?
-<i>Yeah. Like this.</i>

06:27.720 --> 06:28.763
All together!

06:28.846 --> 06:31.391
One, two, three, point!

06:31.474 --> 06:33.768
-<i>What?</i>

06:35.561 --> 06:36.854
That never gets old.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.273
They're getting worse.
Maybe we'll get a good one now.

06:39.774 --> 06:40.775
<i>Hi!</i>

06:40.858 --> 06:43.027
Hello, young lady.
What is your name?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.487
<i>-Brooklyn.</i>
-Brooklyn?

06:44.570 --> 06:46.572
-Where are you?
<i>-At Ohio.</i>

06:46.656 --> 06:49.575
You're in Ohio.
Nice to meet you. How old are you?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.286
<i>-Six.</i>
-Six?

06:52.370 --> 06:53.996
Did she just give me the finger?

06:54.080 --> 06:56.290
She said seven
and then she brought it back to six.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.960
Would you like to tell us
what your idea is?

06:59.043 --> 07:00.920
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-What is it?

07:01.003 --> 07:02.547
<i>A nutcracker.</i>

07:02.630 --> 07:04.507
A nutcracker? Interesting.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.468
What type of nuts are we cracking?
Are we cracking walnuts, coconuts?

07:07.552 --> 07:10.471
<i>It's gonna crack anything.</i>

07:10.555 --> 07:12.765
-Anything?
-Okay. Now you got us.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.184
-Can it crack a watermelon?
<i>-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</i>

07:15.268 --> 07:16.561
How big are we talking?

07:16.644 --> 07:18.479
<i>Humongous!</i>

07:19.605 --> 07:22.400
Tell me more about this nutcracker.
What else can he do?

07:22.483 --> 07:25.445
<i>It has slicing knife arms.</i>

07:25.528 --> 07:27.321
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.283
-That took a left turn fast.
-<i>It's gonna be like…</i>

07:31.826 --> 07:32.910
It's like a Slap Chop.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.205
Why knife slicing?
You wanna be able to cook food--

07:36.289 --> 07:38.875
<i>So it can destroy anything.</i>

07:38.958 --> 07:41.169
-Can destroy anything?

07:41.252 --> 07:44.297
-What evidence are you hiding, kid?
-What is his face gonna look like?

07:44.380 --> 07:47.592
<i>It's going to be fire eyes</i>
<i>instead of regular eyes.</i>

07:47.675 --> 07:49.051
-Hey!
-Fire eyes?

07:49.135 --> 07:51.053
<i>It'll be like…</i>

07:53.890 --> 07:55.308
Where is this coming from?

07:55.391 --> 07:57.810
<i>My brain.</i>

07:57.894 --> 07:59.770
This is why I never go to Ohio.

07:59.854 --> 08:03.065
<i>-Children of the Corn.</i>
<i>-This could be the best nutcracker ever!</i>

08:04.442 --> 08:07.153
-Honestly, I think it's fun.
-Fire is always fun.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.655
Fire, breaking,
melting, chopping, slicing.

08:09.739 --> 08:10.781
<i>Do it.</i>

08:10.865 --> 08:13.201
-Graz, what do you think?
-Two thumbs-up on destruction.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.661
-Seems like a fun build to me.
-Love the fire.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.246
It's dangerous. I like it.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.249
It's the ultimate weapon of destruction
but holiday-themed.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.502
<i>I want you to make my nutcracker.</i>

08:22.585 --> 08:23.961
-I like it.
Love it.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.381
Brooklyn, we're gonna build
your crazy psychotic idea. Okay?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.133
<i>Yay!</i>

08:33.679 --> 08:36.474
<i>This is the best idea I've ever had.</i>

08:36.557 --> 08:39.101
-All right. We'll see you in a couple.
<i>-Bye.</i>

08:39.602 --> 08:42.271
I did not see that coming
from a cute kid with a unicorn horn.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.856
-Yeah.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.776
Come over to my chalkboard,
let me show you how to make it.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.782
I have a couple of initial ideas.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.910
Now, a traditional-looking…

08:58.246 --> 09:01.582
nutcracker has sort of
the marching band outfit on.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.836
-He's got a great physique.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.923
She wants the mouth
to crush all kinds of things.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.758
So we can make it so it'll crush anything.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.344
It'll crush plastic. It'll bend steel.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.263
-Bend steel?
-Yeah. Why not?

09:15.346 --> 09:17.557
Robotic arms that are gonna be like…

09:20.810 --> 09:23.646
-What if sparks fly out of it like this?

09:23.729 --> 09:25.398
-That's a good idea.
-That's pretty cool.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.943
All right. So the mouth will be here.
But since it's gonna be so big,

09:29.026 --> 09:30.945
and we want it
to crack all kinds of things,

09:31.028 --> 09:33.948
maybe we use like a hydraulic press
or like a log splitter.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.826
-Ah.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.328
We're looking at
maybe eight or nine feet tall,

09:39.412 --> 09:42.665
mostly made out of steel structure,
but with some elements of wood.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.958
She's gonna really like that.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.042
Who wants to do what here?

09:45.126 --> 09:47.128
-You guys wanna take the woodwork on?
-Yeah.

09:47.211 --> 09:50.006
I think segmented turning
the head, the hat, maybe the legs.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.009
Yeah. Derek, you and I will work
on the mechanics and the steel.

09:53.092 --> 09:56.178
-Of course.
-We need knives for the under the arms.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.513
-Graz, you take that?
-Yeah.

09:57.597 --> 10:02.560
I'll forge Freddy Krueger claws on one
and then a stabby or slashy on the other?

10:02.643 --> 10:03.561
That'll be fun.

10:03.644 --> 10:07.106
Maybe when we reveal this to the girl,
we can get her a therapist too.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.822
-Let's go get parts.
-Let's do it.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.282
To the part shed.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.326
Let's do it.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.079
Let's go. This way.
Come on back! Easy! Easy!

10:24.040 --> 10:25.416
Grab a handful of stuff.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.252
Let's go.

10:28.336 --> 10:32.256
What you see is an electric wood splitter.
This is gonna go up inside the head.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.383
-Let's go!
-Grab a handful of stuff.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.678
-Oh, baby!
-Come on back. Easy! Let's go!

10:39.013 --> 10:41.682
-Is that rebar?
-It'll be good. It'll be good.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.017
All right?

10:43.100 --> 10:45.311
He's got a good DeNiro.
You see his DeNiro?

10:45.394 --> 10:47.647
-He's good!
-Wow.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.773
How you doing?

10:49.899 --> 10:51.651
Turn my head the other way?

10:51.734 --> 10:54.487
-Go… Go work in the blacksmith shop.
-All right.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.907
Derek, let's get to it.

11:01.577 --> 11:02.703
First things first,

11:02.787 --> 11:06.832
we're gonna turn this log splitter
into the jaws of a nutcracker.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.959
In order to stand
this log splitter upright,

11:09.043 --> 11:11.754
we need to create a metal base
to keep it stable.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.883
We'll start by welding these bars
directly onto it.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.929
And to convert it
from a splitter to a crusher,

11:20.012 --> 11:23.349
we're gonna attach these metal plates
to complete the top and bottom jaw.

11:23.432 --> 11:26.936
Hopefully, they're strong enough
to withstand the seven tons of force

11:27.019 --> 11:30.731
this thing puts out, which is why
it can crush things like this.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.193
Whoo!

11:34.276 --> 11:35.569
It will crush.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.739
<i>This thing sure can crush!</i>

11:38.823 --> 11:40.199
<i>Get it?</i>

11:47.456 --> 11:49.083
-Yeah!
-Oh yeah!

11:49.166 --> 11:50.209
Oh!

11:50.292 --> 11:52.503
-It's hot as hell.
-That one went in my face.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.922
-Oh, it's smoking!
-Not bad.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.175
I think it will crush.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.724
Man, what a twisted little girl.
I like her.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.060
I'm thinking maybe two weapons,

12:08.144 --> 12:10.229
a smashy and a slashy.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.607
For the slashy, I'm thinking
three blades out of a hand

12:13.691 --> 12:15.234
that will be able to chop anything.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.237
And for the smashy, I'm thinking

12:18.821 --> 12:20.698
zombie-death-bat.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.660
I have some rebar around here.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.038
If I cut it in a bunch of little sections
and sharpen it,

12:28.122 --> 12:30.416
those would be like some
pretty gnarly-looking nails

12:30.499 --> 12:33.127
that I could probably weld
like a million on this.

12:33.210 --> 12:36.338
What six-year-old
doesn't love a zombie-death-bat?

12:38.340 --> 12:41.260
-Now it's time to cut some rebar.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.389
I'll cut this iron rebar
into 3-inch pieces

12:45.473 --> 12:47.224
by using an industrial band saw.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.684
Great for cutting hard metals

12:48.768 --> 12:51.479
and for cutting off fingers
if you're not careful.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.107
Rebar is reinforced steel
that's generally used

12:55.191 --> 12:57.318
for holding up concrete walls and bridges,

12:57.401 --> 12:59.570
and it's just about as dense as Derek is.

13:00.404 --> 13:03.240
Here's the thing,
just three feet of half-inch rebar

13:03.324 --> 13:04.992
can weigh up to two pounds.

13:05.534 --> 13:10.706
All right. Now that the rebar is cut,
let's make zombie spiky, sharp things.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.460
It's gonna be sweet.
We're gonna have a lot of sparks.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.756
To hone the rebar into sharp spikes,

13:18.839 --> 13:21.884
I'm using a belt sander
with a 120 grit count.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.513
Grit refers to how jagged
the sandpaper is.

13:25.596 --> 13:29.391
A lower grit count has coarser abrasive
that scrapes off the material quickly.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.603
Oh, look at that. 1 down, 900 to go.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.355
I'm using a very high grit count,

13:34.438 --> 13:38.108
which has a finer abrasive
that leaves a much smoother finish.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.819
That's kinda how I see myself.

13:39.902 --> 13:43.489
Gritty on the outside,
but smooth as silk on the inside.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.288
Okay. So this our model here,

13:51.372 --> 13:54.834
and in CAD what I'm doing,
all these lines are the horizontal lines.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.210
Those are gonna be all the rings.

13:56.293 --> 13:59.547
So each one of these
is 1 and 7/16 of an inch.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.464
Okay.

14:01.048 --> 14:04.176
Pat and I
are in charge of the legs and the head,

14:04.260 --> 14:06.178
which we're making out of segmented wood.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.430
You know what's fun for TV? Math.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.643
We're making
the nutcracker ten feet tall.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.895
We're just getting ready
to do the math now.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.856
I'm not even joking.

14:17.356 --> 14:21.443
So I'm using a program called CAD,
short for Computer Aided Design,

14:21.527 --> 14:24.780
to help me figure out
the precise amount of segments we'll need.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.865
Four,

14:27.241 --> 14:29.660
three, seven, five.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.537
Numbers, numbers.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.499
We'll be creating a bunch of wooden rings
that we can stack on each other

14:35.583 --> 14:37.960
to form the crude shape of each section.

14:41.589 --> 14:45.301
So we'll start by ripping this
inch-and-a-half butcher block into strips.

14:45.384 --> 14:49.138
That just means cutting the wood
lengthwise, parallel to the grain.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.641
After a lot of ripping,
we get a whole stack,

14:52.725 --> 14:54.476
which is great for two things.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.190
And, you know, doing our job, I guess.

15:01.984 --> 15:05.362
I'll be cutting each of these sticks
at a 15-degree angle,

15:06.238 --> 15:08.532
so when Pat combines them together,
he makes rings.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.288
So all in all,
we're looking at about 85 rings

15:14.371 --> 15:16.498
with over 1,000 individual segments.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.085
You might wanna check in with us later,
we're gonna be here a while.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.594
What we're gonna do
is cut the shoulder parts out of steel

15:28.677 --> 15:30.679
using this plasma-cutter table.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.266
In this computer, you can program
the shape of anything you want to cut,

15:34.350 --> 15:37.895
and then the plasma
gets to 45,000 degrees.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.397
So that melts the metal,
then we're dragging it

15:40.481 --> 15:42.983
in the direction we want,
it creates a cut.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.111
-So don't touch.
-Don't touch. Don't look at the light.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.656
I just hope
I don't get attracted to the light.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.574
Like you want to touch it.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.660
I have a stick.
So if you go near it, I'll hit you.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.870
-Okay.
-Here we go. Watch your eyes.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.750
To give you an idea
of how hot 45,000 degrees is,

15:59.833 --> 16:04.797
that's more than four and a half times
the temperature of the surface of the Sun.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.883
How do they know how hot the Sun is?
Nobody's even been there.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.346
The benefit of having so much heat

16:12.429 --> 16:15.557
is that you can easily cut through metals
up to one inch thick.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.310
Here, we're using
3/8-of-an-inch-thick steel

16:18.394 --> 16:21.605
so that the arms will be light enough
to be able to move freely

16:21.689 --> 16:24.984
but also strong enough to hold
the weight of the weaponized hands.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.946
That's unbelievable.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.823
The artist formerly known as…

16:30.906 --> 16:32.574
Oh, I get you.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.044
Oh, hi, neighbor. I didn't see you there.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.588
-Hi!
-Right now, it's time for welding.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.048
Yay!

16:48.132 --> 16:49.049
Remember, kids.

16:49.133 --> 16:53.887
The wonderful world of welding
consists of attaching two metals together.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.015
-And how do we do that?
-How?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.058
By high temperature arcing

16:58.726 --> 17:00.853
with this welding MIG torch.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.438
Ooh!

17:02.521 --> 17:05.441
So this is using
really high-temperature wire

17:05.524 --> 17:08.485
to act as glue
to attach the two metals together.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.822
So come along with me and take a journey.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.407
-So come along… Oh!

17:13.490 --> 17:17.369
So come along with me
as we make a zombie-death-bat.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.663
Can you say "zombie-death-bat"?

17:19.747 --> 17:22.249
Zombie-death-bat!

17:22.332 --> 17:24.209
I knew that you could.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.961
-Now, let's go.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.513
Metal inert gas welding,
or MIG welding,

17:36.597 --> 17:38.766
involves heating up wire so hot

17:38.849 --> 17:42.311
that it liquefies and drips
onto the area that you're fusing together.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.438
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

17:44.521 --> 17:45.355
Perfect.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.692
I'm gonna attach
the lower half of the bicep

17:48.776 --> 17:51.195
and then cut plates
that are gonna carry the springs.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.112
Okay.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.495
If we're gonna show
that this nutcracker means business,

17:59.578 --> 18:02.581
we need to build biceps
that could rotate on the shoulders.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.377
We're incorporating these rusty springs
between the metal plates,

18:07.461 --> 18:09.296
to add bouncing action to the arms.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.884
You know why
you decided to do this project?

18:13.967 --> 18:14.802
Why?

18:14.885 --> 18:17.304
You look at that girl,
and you know what you see?

18:17.971 --> 18:19.264
Yourself.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.644
-I got to bring it up with my therapist.
-I bet you were a destructive kid.

18:23.727 --> 18:24.561
I still am.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.523
You must have some story
where you did something stupid.

18:27.606 --> 18:31.151
Then when I was 14,
I swallowed a nail. A full nail.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.361
-On a bet?
-No.

18:32.444 --> 18:37.199
I had it in my mouth like a toothpick,
and I tripped, and it went… 

18:38.325 --> 18:41.870
The doctor said if it doesn't make its way
through my digestive system in four days,

18:41.954 --> 18:44.164
they were going to go in and operate.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.583
Wow. Tell us about how it got out.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.461
Nature ran its course.
It came out the right way.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.297
I pooped out.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.883
Poop. Poop. Poop. Poop. Poop. Pooped out.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.390
Oh yeah. Getting there!

19:06.895 --> 19:08.105
Oh God, it's heavy.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.821
Every part of this is sharp!

19:15.904 --> 19:17.614
-Hey, Graz.
-Yo.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.160
-So what is that?
-I call her my zombie-death-bat.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.662
Zombie-death-bat!

19:23.745 --> 19:26.748
Didn't Brooklyn ask
for a knife or a sword or something?

19:26.832 --> 19:29.459
Yeah. But I kind of
took the baton and went running.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.419
-Cool.
-Yeah.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.088
-How heavy is it? Awesome.
-It's very heavy.

19:33.172 --> 19:37.050
Yeah. So you wanna test this
out at the ballpark or what?

19:37.134 --> 19:38.343
I thought you'd never ask.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.473
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to Sunday night at the park.</i>

19:43.557 --> 19:44.558
Let's go.

19:44.641 --> 19:49.271
<i>And on the mound for the Lettuce Hurlers</i>
<i>is two-time Cy Young winner Paul Jackman.</i>

19:49.354 --> 19:51.857
<i>Watch out for this guy,</i>
<i>this should be interesting.</i>

19:52.441 --> 19:55.569
<i>And stepping in to the batter's box</i>
<i>for the Zombie Slayers</i>

19:55.652 --> 19:57.154
<i>and making his big-league debut,</i>

19:57.237 --> 20:01.200
<i>the man who goes by only one name. Graz!</i>

20:17.257 --> 20:19.343
Now we got the biceps in place.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.929
Next I think we need to do the forearms.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.348
Hold on, here's the Magic Finger.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.142
There.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.478
Nice.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.481
We should weld up a big triangle
and weld the triangle right to this.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.482
Mm-hmm.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.613
To make the forearms, we'll use
one inch by one inch hollow steel tubing

20:39.696 --> 20:42.157
that we'll weld together into triangles.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.743
Triangles are often used
in bridges and housing structures

20:44.826 --> 20:47.746
because of how naturally strong
they are at absorbing force.

20:52.167 --> 20:55.754
We're gonna need that kinda stability
to support the weaponized hands.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.175
Now we got the rings all done
and sanded down,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.094
so all these are gonna get glued
into a sandwich

21:02.177 --> 21:04.096
that's gonna be one of the legs
of the nutcracker,

21:04.179 --> 21:06.765
which Pat is gonna mount on the lathe
and turn. Excited about that?

21:06.848 --> 21:09.685
Ooh, I'm excited!

21:10.769 --> 21:12.312
-All right, so now we--
-Shh.

21:16.650 --> 21:21.196
Okay. So apparently Pat
would like to do this build in ASMR,

21:21.280 --> 21:23.740
where you hear
all the natural sounds of the build

21:23.824 --> 21:24.866
but amplified.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.159
Let's give it a whirl.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.706
Listen to those ridges.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.542
Oh yeah. That's nice.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.920
Next, we need to stack
all those rings in order.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.173
Let's give that stacking a good listen.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.430
Of course,
we can't forget that glue.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.641
Listen to that glue.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.311
It's gluerific. Isn't it?

21:54.271 --> 21:56.857
Sounds kind of gross, actually.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.067
Time to stack again.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.112
-Sounds like stacking to me.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.531
Finally, prepared for the lathe,

22:04.614 --> 22:07.826
but not before
we get in a game of Watch That Washer.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.536
Let's give that washer a listen.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.421
Can you hear the sound
of that sweet, sweet washer

22:19.504 --> 22:21.548
just being all washy?

22:22.632 --> 22:23.467
And then…

22:26.428 --> 22:30.057
Finally, we put the washer
on the bolt and then we're done.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.937
Oh yeah. That's good stuff.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.526
And then we're done.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.199
<i>Look! It's Santa Graz!</i>

22:47.991 --> 22:50.410
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

22:50.494 --> 22:53.413
All right. Nutcracker from hell!

22:54.122 --> 22:58.293
So each arm's gonna be doing this,
one smashy, one slashy.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.380
So right now,
I'm gonna concentrate on the slashy part.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.674
And for that, I'm thinking
kind of a Freddy Krueger angle,

23:04.758 --> 23:06.093
like blades for hands.

23:06.176 --> 23:09.096
I'm gonna blacksmith
four super-sharp blades

23:09.179 --> 23:13.100
and then weld them to a bar
and then that thing will cut anything.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.394
So let's get lit.

23:18.063 --> 23:23.068
I'm using a double propane forge
that can get up to 2,400 degrees,

23:23.151 --> 23:25.570
or as I like to say, "ouchie-hot."

23:25.654 --> 23:28.573
Well, I… I don't really say that,
but you know what I mean.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.908
Oh, it's getting there!

23:30.450 --> 23:33.495
Back in high school,
my nickname used to be "Hot Steel."

23:34.579 --> 23:35.622
No, it wasn't.

23:35.705 --> 23:39.084
The forge turns
the thin strip of metal red-hot,

23:39.167 --> 23:41.294
making it malleable so I can shape it.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.296
Let's move some metal.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.300
<i> Get down.</i>

23:47.384 --> 23:50.345
Let's move some metal.
Metal. Metal. Metal.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.766
Making knives. Making knives.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.310
Let's move some metal.
Metal. Metal. Metal.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.941
Making knives.
Making knives. Making knives.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.401
<i>Making knives.</i>

24:04.484 --> 24:06.903
Move some metal.
Metal. Metal. Metal.

24:07.529 --> 24:10.532
Now we have a cut blade.
Next up is quenching.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.994
To harden the blade, I have to reheat it
and then cool it down quickly.

24:14.077 --> 24:17.622
So I'll dip it in motor oil,
which cools the metal slower than water,

24:17.706 --> 24:19.958
preventing cracks and soft spots.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.001
Sweet.

24:22.002 --> 24:25.297
It's everyone's favorite part.
The sharpy-stabby part.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.891
It's time to weld the blades to the rod.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.563
Let's move some metal. Metal. Metal.

24:41.646 --> 24:42.564
Karate chop!

24:46.818 --> 24:47.819
That should work.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.493
Now we have a bunch
of segmented rings glued together.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.912
And this, my friend, is gonna be

24:58.413 --> 24:59.831
a nutcracker leg.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.250
This is my favorite part.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.377
Let's turn this.

25:05.337 --> 25:09.925
Turning this many segments
into one leg is, um, exciting.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.470
It is like an orchestra.

25:13.553 --> 25:17.015
Many, many pieces coming together
to play one song.

25:19.017 --> 25:23.396
I am the conductor of this lathe,
and this gouge is my baton.

25:23.897 --> 25:28.235
All I have to do now
is make it my masterpiece.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.626
<i>Voila!</i> A beautiful nutcracker leg.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.006
Knock, knock!

25:50.090 --> 25:52.676
-Whoa!
-Weapons are done.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.136
It only took you 18 days.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.430
Smashy and slashy.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.599
Let me see this thing.
This thing looks heavy.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.851
Whoa! That's gonna go on there like that.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.144
It's got weight to it.

26:06.940 --> 26:07.899
Oh, a bugle!

26:08.733 --> 26:09.985
So this is one leg.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.611
It's got really fat ankles.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.196
All right. This thing is kinda heavy,

26:13.280 --> 26:16.283
so I'm gonna have to figure out
how this mechanism's gonna hold this.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.076
-It's very heavy.
-It's very heavy.

26:18.159 --> 26:20.996
Especially once it's out further
and further from the shoulder pivot.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.455
-Yeah.
-Both legs done, Pat?

26:22.539 --> 26:23.373
-Yeah.
-The head?

26:23.456 --> 26:25.959
-Didn't turn it yet.
-Want me to help you with that?

26:26.042 --> 26:28.295
-Yeah. Please.
-Okay. Turn it together?

26:28.795 --> 26:32.382
-Oh, that's a plan.
-I hear you guys really turn heads.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.177
You know, I wasn't always like this.

26:36.261 --> 26:40.223
A constant need for approval,
using puns as a social crutch,

26:40.724 --> 26:44.936
it's kind of pathetic, I know.
But to understand how I got here--

26:45.020 --> 26:46.187
Come on!

26:46.896 --> 26:47.897
Get back to work.

26:59.909 --> 27:02.537
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Children calling.</i>

27:03.038 --> 27:06.249
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Time to talk to the kids again.</i>

27:06.875 --> 27:08.918
Brooklyn!
What have you been doing?

27:09.002 --> 27:10.920
<i>Just living my best life.</i>

27:12.964 --> 27:15.550
This is the part where you interrupt us
from finishing our work.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.635
I got it.

27:16.718 --> 27:19.971
<i>I'm just here to check on my nutcracker.</i>

27:20.055 --> 27:21.848
<i>-How's it doing?</i>

27:21.931 --> 27:23.141
We're working on it.

27:23.224 --> 27:27.771
<i>So do it have knife arms?</i>

27:27.854 --> 27:28.938
It does.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.192
Graz is working
on the smashy parts for the hands.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.527
<i>Is it gigantic?</i>

27:34.611 --> 27:37.906
Do you see that?
That's the head and the hat alone.

27:39.991 --> 27:40.825
<i>Good.</i>

27:40.909 --> 27:43.161
All right, let's get to it.
What are you here for?

27:44.079 --> 27:46.414
<i>He has to make a smoothie.</i>

27:46.498 --> 27:48.291
What? More?

27:49.167 --> 27:51.586
<i>But wait, there's more!</i>

27:52.170 --> 27:54.756
A smoothie coming out of a nutcracker?

27:55.423 --> 28:00.220
<i>A vanilla smoothie with gummy worms,</i>
<i>chocolate, and marshmallows.</i>

28:00.804 --> 28:01.846
Ugh.

28:01.930 --> 28:02.931
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:03.014 --> 28:05.558
You know how they say
there's no bad ideas?

28:05.642 --> 28:06.810
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:06.893 --> 28:08.269
They were wrong.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.648
I know what you need.
You want it to make a smoothie.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.983
We'll figure out where we could
put a smoothie maker on it.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.068
Fair enough?

28:15.735 --> 28:16.903
<i>Yeah!</i>

28:16.986 --> 28:19.656
-All right?
<i>-Peace out! Ta-ta!</i>

28:19.739 --> 28:20.949
Thanks, Brooklyn.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.993
Where do we put a smoothie in this thing?

28:24.077 --> 28:26.162
We gotta somehow hack a device

28:26.246 --> 28:29.666
that's gonna be able
to make a smoothie then dispense it.

28:29.749 --> 28:31.084
Where? What part of the--

28:31.167 --> 28:33.002
-Top of the head.
-This is three feet.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.672
You have about a foot
at the top of the hat to play with.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.174
It has to come out of the nose.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.175
Brilliant.

28:39.259 --> 28:42.137
-Ready? Let's continue on with our tasks.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.722
I forget what I was doing.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.114
Welcome to Blenderville. Population, us.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.323
We got a blender blade here.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.451
Thinking of attaching this
to one of these containers?

29:04.534 --> 29:08.037
-I am. So the first part is to cut a hole…
-Sure.

29:08.121 --> 29:09.748
…mount the blade in there.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.500
We have to figure out a way
to get the smoothie out.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.794
-Right. I like the big tube.
-Yeah.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.672
This would stick through the nose
almost all the way through it.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.175
Yeah. Then we seal everything
with some silicone

29:20.258 --> 29:22.010
and just plop it in the head and…

29:22.677 --> 29:23.678
Okay.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.181
Just above
the top of the log splitter,

29:26.264 --> 29:29.851
we'll add the blender base
and attach this large plastic jug

29:29.934 --> 29:31.686
that we'll have to cut in half.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.522
Then we'll run a plastic tube
from the bottom of the jug

29:34.606 --> 29:36.441
that will feed out of the nose.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.320
I made this chunk of wood here.
I figured that'll be the nose.

29:40.403 --> 29:41.404
Okay.

29:42.530 --> 29:44.365
Let me just… Model for me?

29:46.493 --> 29:48.411
All right, I think that'll be perfect.

29:55.293 --> 29:58.671
Now we need to put
the mechanics in place to power the arms.

29:58.755 --> 30:01.466
So what I need to do
is make a rest for this gear,

30:01.549 --> 30:05.220
and then I need to make a drive pin
that's gonna make this go like that.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.680
-Okay.
-Then we're gonna mount the motor here.

30:08.264 --> 30:11.768
The only way to see if this works,
is to weld it all up and give it a shot.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.144
All right. Let's do it.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.360
Derek and I
are constructing a two-pulley system

30:20.443 --> 30:23.822
powered by a 110-volt electric motor

30:23.905 --> 30:25.949
to move the nutcracker's giant arms.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.451
This is the link-belt.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.912
You could make them any length you want.

30:30.995 --> 30:31.830
Nice.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.209
Tack it in place and try it.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.962
And now we need
to attach Graz's zombie-death-bat

30:39.045 --> 30:41.339
and his knife-hand to the forearm.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.051
Let's give it a try. See what happens.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.177
-Ready?
-Go!

30:48.763 --> 30:50.265
-It works!
-Nice!

30:50.348 --> 30:51.474
It's chopping!

30:52.225 --> 30:55.061
Now that we have the nutcracker
smashing and slashing…

30:55.144 --> 30:56.604
-Hold on.
-Hold on, I got it.

30:56.688 --> 31:00.650
…it's time to add the head to get a sense
of what this thing's gonna look like.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.278
-Looks like a nutcracker.
-It looks unbelievable.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.071
All right. Let's bring this thing home.

31:05.154 --> 31:07.991
We have to install the blender
that's gonna make the smoothie.

31:08.074 --> 31:09.993
-Jackman, you're on the face details.
-Yes.

31:10.076 --> 31:11.452
Pat's on the boots.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.455
If this thing doesn't get done soon,
I'm gonna stick my head in its mouth.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.415
Promise?

31:16.791 --> 31:18.376
-Let's get going.
-Let's do it.

31:20.211 --> 31:26.092
<i>It's the final push. </i>

31:28.261 --> 31:29.679
Yeah. Go straight up, Jimmy.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.639
Good thing
there's nothing sharp on it.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.808
This nutcracker
weighs hundreds of pounds,

31:33.892 --> 31:36.144
so, in order to fit
the wooden legs to the frame,

31:36.227 --> 31:38.813
we'll need a forklift
to lift the torso up and off.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.106
Perfect!

31:40.189 --> 31:42.191
Of course,
every nut job needs a face.

31:43.484 --> 31:46.154
So from solid steel,
we'll forge a mustache.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.655
He wants to look evil.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.991
Jackman is using
the wood-burning tool

31:50.074 --> 31:51.868
to notch out the eyes and the eyebrows,

31:51.951 --> 31:55.496
and he's using a hole saw
to bore out the eye sockets.

31:57.206 --> 32:00.710
For the nutcracker's feet,
Pat is cutting up angled strips of wood

32:00.793 --> 32:04.422
that he'll glue together,
and that will lay over the metal frame.

32:04.505 --> 32:06.883
We'll cut this off here,
attach that into the base.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.760
-Yep.
-Then this will sit here.

32:09.510 --> 32:12.639
Jackman and Graz are working out
how this thing is gonna make a smoothie.

32:12.722 --> 32:13.765
That should work.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.225
Bam!

32:17.644 --> 32:18.770
Ooh, look at that!

32:18.853 --> 32:21.689
Of course, Brooklyn wanted fire
coming from the eyes.

32:21.773 --> 32:22.732
That's gonna look great.

32:22.815 --> 32:25.568
So we'll be using two propane burners
from the blacksmithing forge

32:25.652 --> 32:27.904
that will poke out of each eyehole.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.989
Looks good. Have them poke out more.

32:30.865 --> 32:33.993
-This is the nose here.
-Did you shape that nose after Graz?

32:34.827 --> 32:35.703
How'd you know?

32:37.038 --> 32:39.290
This is gonna be
one heck of a smashing…

32:39.374 --> 32:40.708
Slicing, crushing…

32:40.792 --> 32:42.585
-Burning…
-Juicing…

32:42.669 --> 32:43.962
Machine!

32:44.462 --> 32:47.048
-Look at those legs. Beautiful.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.217
It's done. I think
Brooklyn's gonna be happy with it.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.551
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

32:51.135 --> 32:54.514
-It looks like it's gonna come to life.
-It's kind of uncomfortable.

32:54.597 --> 32:55.765
Let's get out of here.

32:59.852 --> 33:01.521
Looks like
it's gonna come to life.

33:01.604 --> 33:02.855
It's kinda uncomfortable.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.358
-Come to life.
-She's gonna sic this on us.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.696
Guys, time to get Brooklyn up here

33:09.779 --> 33:13.241
to show her the deadliest nutcracker
this side of the Pentagon.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.325
Brooklyn.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.284
<i>Okay.</i>

33:16.452 --> 33:17.495
How are you?

33:17.578 --> 33:19.372
<i>I am </i>perfecto<i> today.</i>

33:19.455 --> 33:22.125
Very good.
You ready to have your day get better?

33:22.208 --> 33:23.209
<i>You bet I am.</i>

33:23.292 --> 33:26.004
All right. You wanna see
this monstrosity you designed?

33:26.087 --> 33:29.716
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Ready to see this weapon of destruction?

33:29.799 --> 33:32.510
<i>Show me this nutcracker, right now!</i>

33:32.593 --> 33:34.512
You ready to see this nutcracker I-R-L?

33:34.595 --> 33:36.681
<i>-Yes, I am!</i>
-Hit it!

33:49.360 --> 33:50.820
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

33:51.446 --> 33:53.364
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

33:54.657 --> 33:55.616
<i>Yeah!</i>

33:56.743 --> 33:59.328
<i>Oh my God!</i>

34:02.081 --> 34:05.877
What you're looking at
is 10 giant feet of holiday hell.

34:06.753 --> 34:09.005
Look at the giant head
made out of segmented wood.

34:09.088 --> 34:12.258
This is glued together
from almost 1,000 pieces of wood.

34:12.341 --> 34:14.385
<i>Oh my goodness!</i>

34:14.469 --> 34:17.555
The mustache is made out
of solid steel.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.893
Underneath that mustache,
we have a recycled log splitter

34:21.976 --> 34:24.896
that's gonna crush
anything we put inside of it.

34:24.979 --> 34:28.608
On one arm are blacksmithed blades
that are very sharp.

34:28.691 --> 34:30.485
<i>Slicing arms!</i>

34:30.568 --> 34:32.945
A bat that's designed to kill a zombie!

34:33.529 --> 34:34.405
<i>What?</i>

34:34.489 --> 34:36.824
The eyes are made
out of two gas-forge burners.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.869
When we turn them on,
they're gonna blow flames out of the eyes.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.414
Brooklyn, guess where
the smoothie comes out of.

34:45.917 --> 34:46.751
The nose.

34:48.169 --> 34:51.005
<i>I hope there's no boogers in my smoothie.</i>

34:51.589 --> 34:52.882
What do you think?

34:52.965 --> 34:56.302
<i>Doggy says it looks…</i>

34:57.095 --> 34:58.346
<i>terrifying!</i>

34:59.055 --> 35:00.306
Good job, guys.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.809
<i>I wanna see this thing in action!</i>

35:02.892 --> 35:06.771
Brooklyn, we're gonna slice, smash,
crash, and set some things on fire.

35:06.854 --> 35:07.688
Are you ready?

35:07.772 --> 35:09.565
<i>Of course I am!</i>

35:09.649 --> 35:11.192
Guys, let's get ready.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.661
Brooklyn, welcome to your nightmare.

35:21.744 --> 35:23.246
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

35:23.329 --> 35:26.707
We're gonna start by crushing things
in the mouth. Are you ready?

35:26.791 --> 35:28.417
<i>Yes!</i>

35:28.501 --> 35:31.671
-Want a watermelon?
-<i> Let's see it crush!</i>

35:31.754 --> 35:33.422
-Here we go!

35:33.506 --> 35:36.551
-Say goodbye to that watermelon!
<i>-Oh my gosh.</i>

35:38.261 --> 35:40.012
<i>That's disgusting.</i>

35:40.096 --> 35:42.306
<i>It looked like he was throwing up.</i>

35:42.390 --> 35:44.267
Hey! Who bought the nutcracker?

35:44.350 --> 35:46.394
Wait. Does that count for cannibalism?

35:46.477 --> 35:48.062
Say goodbye, nutcracker!

35:49.605 --> 35:51.190
<i>No! Don't do it!</i>

35:51.274 --> 35:52.108
<i>No!</i>

35:52.859 --> 35:54.902
Brooklyn, you ready
for the smashing and the slashing?

35:54.986 --> 35:57.488
<i>Oh my God. I'm ready for the hands.</i>

35:57.572 --> 35:59.615
Let us smash stuff.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.665
Oh my God!

36:09.458 --> 36:10.293
Yeah.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.378
It's not… It's not great, Graz.

36:12.461 --> 36:14.088
-<i>My God.</i>
-You failed!

36:17.091 --> 36:20.428
<i>Are we gonna do fire eyes now?</i>

36:20.511 --> 36:21.470
The fire eyes?

36:21.554 --> 36:23.347
-Fire in the hole.
Ignition.

36:25.558 --> 36:28.144
-<i> Oh my God!</i>
-Whoa!

36:31.230 --> 36:33.441
<i>Look at it go!</i>

36:33.524 --> 36:34.692
It's on fire now.

36:35.484 --> 36:38.321
<i> Can we just go on</i>
<i>with the smoothie?</i>

36:38.404 --> 36:39.822
The smoothie of death.

36:39.906 --> 36:40.823
<i>Death?</i>

36:40.907 --> 36:42.909
A smoothie
is usually healthy, Jimmy.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.118
Are you ready?

36:44.202 --> 36:45.536
<i>You bet I am.</i>

36:45.620 --> 36:49.498
We got strawberries,
blueberries, gummy bears, milk.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.584
<i>Let's make smoothies!</i>

36:51.667 --> 36:52.543
Just send it.

36:53.252 --> 36:54.962
-It actually works.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.635
<i>More gummy bears! More gummy bears!</i>

37:01.510 --> 37:03.346
Oh! Oh yeah! Oh!

37:03.429 --> 37:05.598
-Yeah, smoothie!
-Oh yeah!

37:05.681 --> 37:07.975
-Oh boy.
<i>-Who's gonna taste it?</i>

37:08.059 --> 37:10.061
-Pat. Enjoy.
-Here we go.

37:12.438 --> 37:15.650
<i>-That is gross.</i>

37:15.733 --> 37:19.362
Okay. Are you ready
to see everything at once?

37:19.445 --> 37:20.738
<i>Of course I am.</i>

37:20.821 --> 37:22.240
Okay. Here we go.

37:22.323 --> 37:25.159
<i>Fire eyes! Fire eyes! Fire eyes!</i>

37:25.660 --> 37:26.994
<i>Slicing arms!</i>

37:27.078 --> 37:30.665
It doesn't work anymore!
The arms got fruit juice all over them!

37:30.748 --> 37:32.124
Hey. The fire works!

37:32.208 --> 37:33.668
<i>Burn, baby. Burn!</i>

37:36.629 --> 37:39.715
Is this the nutcracker of your dreams
or of your nightmares?

37:39.799 --> 37:40.967
You tell us.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.260
<i>Dreams.</i>

37:42.343 --> 37:44.470
Thank you very much.
That was really sweet.

37:44.553 --> 37:46.555
<i>Best nutcracker ever!</i>

37:46.639 --> 37:49.225
Brooklyn, if you're satisfied,
then we're satisfied.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.310
<i>Yes. Thank you.</i>

37:51.394 --> 37:55.189
-Did you enjoy yourself?
<i>-Best day ever!</i>

37:55.690 --> 37:57.441
-Now get out of here!

37:57.984 --> 38:00.361
-Guys, clean up. I gotta take a nap.
-All right.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.071
Looks like
you enjoyed the smoothie.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.322
The smoothie was good.
