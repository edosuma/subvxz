WEBVTT

00:08.041 --> 00:09.571
paw patrol, paw patrol

00:09.576 --> 00:12.676
we'll be there on
the double

00:12.679 --> 00:14.449
whenever there's a problem

00:14.447 --> 00:17.017
round adventure bay

00:17.017 --> 00:18.647
ryder and his team of pups

00:18.652 --> 00:20.122
will come and save
the day

00:20.120 --> 00:22.250
marshall, rubble, chase

00:22.255 --> 00:23.615
rocky, zuma, skye

00:23.623 --> 00:25.563
yeah, they're on
the way

00:25.559 --> 00:27.429
paw patrol, paw patrol

00:27.427 --> 00:30.087
whenever you're
in trouble

00:30.096 --> 00:31.596
paw patrol, paw patrol

00:31.598 --> 00:33.568
we'll be there on
the double

00:33.567 --> 00:35.627
no job's too big,
no pup's too small

00:35.635 --> 00:39.165
paw patrol,
we're on a roll!

00:39.172 --> 00:41.342
so here we go
paw patrol

00:41.341 --> 00:42.641
whoa-oh-oh

00:42.642 --> 00:43.612
paw patrol

00:43.610 --> 00:45.310
whoa-oh-oh-oh

00:45.312 --> 00:47.182
paw patrol

00:53.053 --> 00:55.053
Farmer al:
Oh, come on now.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.285
Please stay out of the barn.

00:56.289 --> 00:59.659
Hey, and careful where you put
those muddy hooves,

00:59.659 --> 01:00.689
I just mopped up!

01:00.694 --> 01:01.764
Need some help, farmer al?

01:01.761 --> 01:05.331
Yup, I'm trying to do my big
spring cleaning,

01:05.331 --> 01:07.502
But my critters keep getting in
the way.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.430
(cow mooing)

01:08.435 --> 01:10.635
(sighing) I've got to find
someplace else for them

01:10.637 --> 01:12.097
To sleep tonight.

01:12.105 --> 01:14.135
(goat bleating, thudding)

01:14.140 --> 01:16.110
Aw, what's wrong with garby?

01:16.109 --> 01:18.479
Oh, he's so upset about
leaving the barn,

01:18.478 --> 01:21.048
He doesn't even want to
look at me.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.307
Bah!

01:22.315 --> 01:24.375
It's too bad your
animals can't have

01:24.384 --> 01:26.324
A sleepover with
their friends.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.089
Hey, that's a great idea,
marshall.

01:28.088 --> 01:33.358
Robo-dog, bring the paw
patroller to farmer al's.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.030
(barking)

01:34.027 --> 01:38.097
The pups and I will find nice
homes where your goats and gals

01:38.098 --> 01:38.828
Can spend the night.

01:38.832 --> 01:42.102
We could even take in a few
animals ourselves.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.602
Oh, ya hear that?

01:43.603 --> 01:46.743
Who wants to have
a sleepover?

01:46.740 --> 01:48.510
(excited animal chattering)

01:48.508 --> 01:49.668
(brakes screeching)

01:49.676 --> 01:52.636
Right this way,
barn buddies.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.546
(sheep bleating, roosters
crowing)

01:55.548 --> 01:56.878
(brakes screeching)

01:56.883 --> 01:59.183
(cow mooing)
come on in, patina.

01:59.185 --> 02:03.085
We're going to style your tail
and polish your hooves.

02:03.089 --> 02:05.519
It'll be the best sleepover
ever.

02:05.525 --> 02:08.025
(cow mooing)

02:10.463 --> 02:11.833
(sheep bleating)

02:11.831 --> 02:14.601
Welcome to my place, sheepies.

02:14.601 --> 02:15.671
(sheep bleating)

02:15.669 --> 02:17.539
Now, how do you like your hay?

02:17.537 --> 02:18.467
(sheep bleating)

02:18.471 --> 02:20.371
Fresh and crispy,
coming right up!

02:20.373 --> 02:25.643
Emma, you're the first vip to
ever stay with us!

02:25.645 --> 02:30.175
Vip, as in very important pig.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.283
(chicken clucking)

02:32.285 --> 02:35.745
Let me give you my landlubbers
tour of the flounder.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.755
You've got your fore, your aft,

02:37.757 --> 02:38.687
Your stern, your bow,

02:38.692 --> 02:41.362
Your starboard, your port.

02:41.561 --> 02:44.531
Bravo for finding the bait
bucket, buddy.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.701
(goat bleating)

02:46.700 --> 02:49.170
(barking)

02:49.169 --> 02:53.139
Having a sleepover with farmer
al's animals is going to be

02:53.139 --> 02:53.739
Barn-tastic!

02:53.740 --> 02:57.480
Yeah, we'll play games
and tell silly stories.

02:57.477 --> 03:01.377
And have late night snacks,
and early morning snacks,

03:01.381 --> 03:03.721
And midday snacks.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.477
Hee-hee.

03:04.484 --> 03:08.094
Maybe we can even take our
little campers to see

03:08.088 --> 03:09.688
Raymundo's circus.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.489
Awesome idea!

03:10.490 --> 03:13.730
He's coming to town tomorrow
with his big-top tent.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.588
(brakes screeching,
sheep bleating)

03:16.596 --> 03:19.496
Pups, find a sleepover buddy,

03:19.499 --> 03:22.399
And show them where they'll be
bunking tonight.

03:22.402 --> 03:23.772
Follow me, sheepy.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.240
This way, pig dude.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.638
(pig squealing)

03:26.639 --> 03:30.809
(excited animal chattering)

03:30.810 --> 03:34.080
(barking)

03:35.148 --> 03:35.908
I told you it was fun.

03:35.915 --> 03:39.245
Now come on, let's have even
more fun inside!

03:39.252 --> 03:40.322
(sheep bleating)

03:40.320 --> 03:40.990
Going up.

03:40.987 --> 03:44.457
Hey, anybody seen
my lamb-y buddy?

03:44.457 --> 03:46.387
(phone ringing)

03:46.393 --> 03:47.163
(sheep bleating)

03:47.160 --> 03:51.430
(laughing) I think I know where
your lost sheep is,

03:51.431 --> 03:54.531
Lil' bow marshall.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.334
(beeping)

03:55.335 --> 03:58.795
<i> Yes, hello ryder!</i>
<i> Ryder? Hmm.</i>

03:58.805 --> 04:00.535
<i> Ahoy, ryder!</i>

04:00.540 --> 04:06.180
<i> Uh, ryder? No offence, but I</i>
<i> think you need a haircut.</i>

04:06.179 --> 04:08.449
There you are, lamby.

04:08.448 --> 04:09.478
Come on downstairs.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.682
Farmer al wants to
say goodnight.

04:11.684 --> 04:14.824
(sheep bleating)

04:14.821 --> 04:17.821
Okay, farmer al,
everybody's here.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.494
<i> Hi little lambs and piglets,</i>

04:19.492 --> 04:21.692
<i> I hope you're all being</i>
<i> good guests.</i>

04:21.694 --> 04:23.934
<i> I'll see you back at the farm</i>
<i> tomorrow.</i>

04:23.930 --> 04:28.930
<i> Until then,</i>
<i> goodnight and sleep tight.</i>

04:28.935 --> 04:30.595
(sad bleating)

04:30.603 --> 04:33.943
I think they really miss
farmer al.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.410
They look kind of homesick.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.679
Or barn-sick.

04:37.677 --> 04:41.847
Well, a good nights sleep
will help.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.408
(pig squealing)

04:43.416 --> 04:45.246
(snoring)

04:45.251 --> 04:46.321
(sheep bleating)

04:46.319 --> 04:49.589
(marshall sighing)
(sheep bleating)

04:49.589 --> 04:51.819
(pig squealing)

04:53.393 --> 04:55.393
(thunder bellowing)
(animals shrieking)

04:55.395 --> 04:59.695
Ohh, I sure hope this storm
doesn't frighten my animals

04:59.699 --> 05:00.769
Too much.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.527
(thunder booming)

05:03.536 --> 05:04.496
(cow mooing)

05:04.504 --> 05:06.904
(sheep bleating)

05:06.906 --> 05:10.406
Oh my! Chickaletta!

05:10.410 --> 05:13.510
Our sleepover piggy is gone!

05:13.513 --> 05:15.313
(phone ringing)

05:15.315 --> 05:17.475
Mayor goodway,
what's wrong?

05:17.484 --> 05:18.954
<i> Our piggy pal disappeared.</i>

05:18.952 --> 05:20.622
<i> I don't know where</i>
<i> patina went!</i>

05:20.620 --> 05:23.490
<i> I'm sleepless,</i>
<i>'cause I'm sheepless.</i>

05:23.490 --> 05:25.260
Don't worry,
everybody,

05:25.258 --> 05:25.958
We'll find them.

05:25.959 --> 05:29.529
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

05:29.529 --> 05:30.289
(beeping)

05:30.296 --> 05:33.026
Paw patrol,
to the lookout!

05:33.032 --> 05:34.472
Pups:
Ryder needs us!

05:34.467 --> 05:36.797
(yawning) ryder needs us.

05:36.803 --> 05:37.773
Ah!

05:37.770 --> 05:39.400
Woah!

05:39.405 --> 05:39.995
(thudding)

05:40.006 --> 05:42.406
Woah, woah, woah! Ugh!

05:42.408 --> 05:44.078
Mm, comfy.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.877
(snoring)

05:45.879 --> 05:48.909
(laughing)

05:50.000 --> 05:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:58.558 --> 06:00.688
(elevator dinging)

06:03.396 --> 06:07.296
Paw patrol ready for action,
ryder, sir!

06:07.300 --> 06:08.570
Well, not quite,

06:08.568 --> 06:11.338
'cause all of our sleepover
buddies are missing.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.067
What are we going to do?
What should we do, ryder?

06:14.073 --> 06:15.743
Our barn buddies!

06:15.742 --> 06:16.442
(beeping)

06:16.442 --> 06:18.382
It's not just your sleepover
friends,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.808
It's all of farmer al's
animals,

06:20.813 --> 06:22.013
But we're gonna rescue them.

06:22.015 --> 06:25.375
Farmer al's animals are
somewhere in adventure bay.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.645
I think they got homesick and
are trying to

06:27.654 --> 06:28.894
Find their way home.

06:28.888 --> 06:29.788
(thunder clapping)

06:29.789 --> 06:33.929
Thunder? Oh no! Now they're
homesick and probably afraid.

06:33.927 --> 06:38.327
Right, so we have to do a night
time round up before

06:38.331 --> 06:39.831
The storm gets here.

06:39.832 --> 06:40.532
Skye,

06:40.533 --> 06:43.533
Fly your copter towards farmer
al's barn and use your

06:43.536 --> 06:46.766
Searchlight to see if any
animals are heading that way.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.813
(barking) let's take to the sky!

06:49.809 --> 06:50.879
Chase,

06:50.877 --> 06:53.907
Follow skye and use you
megaphone to round up

06:53.913 --> 06:55.753
The lost animals she finds.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.678
Chase is on the case.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.584
(phone ringing)

06:58.585 --> 07:00.015
<i>Ryder, the flounder's</i>
<i> floated away.</i>

07:00.019 --> 07:03.619
<i> I guess garby the goat gobbled</i>
<i> through my mooring line</i>

07:03.623 --> 07:04.663
<i>And sailed out to sea!</i>

07:04.657 --> 07:05.887
Don't worry,
captain turbot.

07:05.892 --> 07:09.592
We'll bring back the boat
and the goat.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.126
Zuma,

07:10.129 --> 07:14.029
I need you to use your
hovercraft to find the flounder.

07:14.033 --> 07:15.603
Let's dive in!

07:15.602 --> 07:18.802
Alright, paw patrol is on
a roll!

07:18.805 --> 07:20.195
(excited barking)

07:22.942 --> 07:24.712
paw patrol

07:24.711 --> 07:27.811
(barking)

07:27.814 --> 07:28.714
paw patrol

07:28.715 --> 07:29.975
go, go, go, go!

07:29.983 --> 07:33.123
Whoo, yeah!

07:33.119 --> 07:35.489
(barking) wee!

07:39.792 --> 07:40.892
chase!

07:40.893 --> 07:41.733
Ruff!

07:41.728 --> 07:43.998
go, go, go, go!

07:43.997 --> 07:46.927
go, go, go, go!

07:46.933 --> 07:48.073
paw patrol

07:48.067 --> 07:49.697
(siren wailing)

07:49.702 --> 07:51.772
go, go, go, go!

07:51.771 --> 07:52.571
zuma!

07:52.572 --> 07:55.212
go, go, go, go!

07:55.208 --> 07:57.778
go, go, go, go!

07:57.777 --> 07:59.577
go, go, go, go!

07:59.579 --> 08:02.709
paw patrol, paw patrol

08:02.715 --> 08:04.715
(tires screeching)

08:04.717 --> 08:08.917
(sirens wailing)

08:08.921 --> 08:13.061
(revving)

08:14.761 --> 08:19.001
(sirens wailing)

08:22.835 --> 08:24.635
(cow mooing)

08:24.637 --> 08:25.767
(helicopter whirring)

08:25.772 --> 08:27.972
Skye:
Chase, I found patina!

08:27.974 --> 08:28.874
(siren wailing)

08:28.875 --> 08:30.335
Chase:
I'll take it from here.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.113
(barking)
megaphone!

08:32.111 --> 08:35.181
(electric humming)

08:35.181 --> 08:37.581
Moo!

08:37.582 --> 08:39.053
(cow mooing)

08:39.052 --> 08:43.922
Skye:
Heading for famer al's, but
still haven't spotted any--

08:43.923 --> 08:46.593
Wait, there's a couple sheep.

08:46.592 --> 08:50.232
Munching on mayor goodway's
tulips.

08:50.229 --> 08:51.659
Hey, sheep!

08:51.664 --> 08:54.334
Those tulips aren't
for your two lips.

08:54.334 --> 08:58.044
I'm going to try luring them
away with something else to eat.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.237
Be right back!

09:00.239 --> 09:05.139
Baa! Baa! Get your
yummy hay right here!

09:05.945 --> 09:07.845
(pig oinking)

09:07.847 --> 09:09.247
Oink-oink?

09:09.248 --> 09:10.778
(pig oinking)

09:10.783 --> 09:13.853
(thunder clapping)

09:13.853 --> 09:16.853
(goat bleating)

09:16.856 --> 09:18.756
Zuma:
Ahoy, captain garby.

09:18.758 --> 09:19.618
We'll save you!

09:19.625 --> 09:22.525
The flounder's getting way too
close to that rock.

09:22.528 --> 09:26.898
Zuma, bark out your buoy
and tow it the other way, fast!

09:26.899 --> 09:30.569
Aye aye, ryder!
Ruff ruff! Buoy!

09:34.374 --> 09:38.684
Great job, zuma.
Jet ski, autopilot.

09:40.012 --> 09:41.952
Zuma, pull my jet ski back
to shore.

09:41.948 --> 09:46.018
I'll steer the flounder in
before that nasty storm hits.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.188
(goat bleating)

09:48.187 --> 09:52.287
Way to go, chase. I think we
rounded up almost all

09:52.291 --> 09:54.631
Of farmer al's lost animals.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.687
Welcome to the
party, garby.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.896
Oh, that make all
of the animals.

09:58.898 --> 10:02.768
Ryder:
Aw. They seem so much happier
when they're all together.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.629
(thunder clapping)

10:03.636 --> 10:06.296
(gasping) uh-oh,
the storm's about to hit.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.665
We need a shelter for
our barn buddies.

10:08.674 --> 10:11.184
Where could we possibly
put all these animals?

10:11.177 --> 10:12.037
(thunder clapping)

10:12.044 --> 10:16.254
Look, raymundo's already
putting up his tent.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.851
Pups:
Oh no!

10:19.852 --> 10:21.952
He was putting up
his tent.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.924
Looks like he could
use some help.

10:23.923 --> 10:26.163
It'll be alright, guys.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.329
I just though of a way to keep
you out of the storm.

10:29.328 --> 10:33.198
Paw patrol, meet us at the
soccer field.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.199
<i> On our way!</i>

10:35.201 --> 10:38.071
(hammering)

10:38.070 --> 10:41.710
(revving)

10:41.707 --> 10:45.107
Ryder, you and you pups
are magicians.

10:45.111 --> 10:49.811
I never would have been able to
put up this tent in this wind

10:49.816 --> 10:50.946
Without the paw patrol.

10:50.950 --> 10:55.220
Happy to help, raymundo.
So, can I ask a favor?

10:55.221 --> 10:56.221
As away! Anything.

10:56.222 --> 11:00.722
Great, our farm friends
need a place to spend the night

11:00.726 --> 11:01.786
Absolutely!

11:01.794 --> 11:05.604
Everyone is welcome under
the big-top tent.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.228
Okay everybody,

11:06.232 --> 11:10.842
Come on in and snuggle up
before the rain starts.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.697
Come on! There's
plenty of room.

11:13.706 --> 11:18.036
Now, that's a dandy looking
place for a critter sleepover.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.144
(excited animal chattering)

11:19.145 --> 11:21.945
What are we standing out here
for? Come on,

11:21.948 --> 11:24.278
Let's skedaddle inside
before we get wet.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.153
(thunder clapping)

11:25.151 --> 11:29.491
Thanks for calling me over,
ryder, and thank you paw patrol.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.819
Now that my barn critters are
back together,

11:31.824 --> 11:33.864
They're ready for
a good night's sleep.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.130
Whenever you or your critters
are in trouble,

11:37.129 --> 11:39.199
Just yelp for help.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.368
(barking)

11:41.367 --> 11:47.807
And just in time, nobody got
wet, especially me.
