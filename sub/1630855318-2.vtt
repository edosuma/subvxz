00:00.130 --> 00:02.872
Previously, on
"The Real Housewives
of Atlanta"...

00:02.872 --> 00:05.179
God said
there will be a party,

00:05.179 --> 00:06.310
and there will light.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.965
Yes, my baby
is turning 40.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.054
Todd, isn't it
family time?

00:11.054 --> 00:12.142
I'm trying to finish
this script.

00:12.142 --> 00:15.667
He wants to
make me a problem.

00:15.667 --> 00:18.148
I don't ever wanna see you
end up in divorce court

00:18.148 --> 00:19.106
like me.
- Never.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.411
So, you've gotta
find a way

00:20.411 --> 00:22.152
to make time
for your husband.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.893
I can do squats in these
boots, if y'all want.

00:23.893 --> 00:26.287
Courtney.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.940
Courtney is
a girlfriend of mine.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.290
She is no nonsense.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.769
Kandi was the first one
to RSVP.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.207
She was calling around
asking some people about me,

00:33.207 --> 00:34.425
and she was like--

00:34.425 --> 00:37.298
I heard she said
that we were friends. Hmm.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.995
Is being my assistant
harder than you thought?

00:38.995 --> 00:40.127
You're always
trying somethin'.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.520
You don't respect boundaries.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.174
You're trying to find
something else

00:44.174 --> 00:46.089
for him to do
instead of allowing him

00:46.089 --> 00:48.135
to just eat his dinner.

00:48.135 --> 00:50.267
Uh, you think Sheree
is gonna bring her new boo?

00:50.267 --> 00:51.573
Girl, them streets.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.183
The streets been
talking to you, too?

00:53.183 --> 00:56.099
He did lightweight
try to talk to me.

00:56.099 --> 00:59.015
He's a thirst trap!

00:59.015 --> 01:02.410
Welcome to Ross's
40th bash.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.849
- How you doin', my love.
- Good. It's nice to see you.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.242
It's official, though?

01:10.679 --> 01:11.288
Okay.

01:12.376 --> 01:13.421
Somebody asked me,
did I know you,

01:13.421 --> 01:15.292
and I was like
I don't know her.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.033
I don't have
to clout chase.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.469
I never said
you clout chased!

01:18.469 --> 01:20.036
- Well, calm the down.
- No, all right.

01:20.036 --> 01:22.517
I'm about to headbutt
this bitch!

01:22.517 --> 01:24.606
He did slide
into my DMs before.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.917
Oh, my God!

01:31.917 --> 01:33.354
Martell slid into your DMs?
- Yeah.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.792
It was at least
six months ago.

01:36.792 --> 01:37.749
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:37.749 --> 01:39.186
It was before you.
- Yeah.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.578
I don't want you hearing it
from anybody else.

01:40.578 --> 01:41.840
- Yeah.
- I don't want you to feel

01:41.840 --> 01:43.364
like I'm not being truthful.

01:43.364 --> 01:46.193
If it was something about
any guy I'm dealing with,

01:46.193 --> 01:47.455
I want you to tell me.
- No, no, no.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.760
- Bitch, what you gonna do?
- You better--

01:48.760 --> 01:51.720
- What you gonna do?
- No, no, no, no. No, no.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.764
- What's going on?
- No.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.201
What happened?

01:54.201 --> 01:57.160
She keeps doing this sh--
in my----in' face!

01:57.160 --> 01:58.205
What y'all
talking about?

01:58.205 --> 01:59.815
You know,
you are the topic.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.077
Hot topic--
we aren't even--

02:01.077 --> 02:03.210
- What y'all sayin'?
- Uh...

02:03.210 --> 02:06.169
So, they pulled me
to the side and told me--

02:13.220 --> 02:15.439
One of Kandi's minions
has some tea on Martell.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.484
I mean, what else
would be doin',

02:16.484 --> 02:18.181
if they weren't
talking about me?

02:18.181 --> 02:19.791
They thought they was gonna
ruffle my feathers,

02:19.791 --> 02:21.706
but we're wearing feathers
tonight, honey,

02:21.706 --> 02:22.794
not ruffling them.

02:22.794 --> 02:23.839
Yeah, we ain't gotta
worry about

02:23.839 --> 02:25.057
whoever y'all
are talking about.

02:25.057 --> 02:25.928
Okay, so,
she's non-existent anymore,

02:25.928 --> 02:27.147
basically.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.409
No, we ain't gonna say,
"Anymore."

02:28.409 --> 02:30.498
We're gonna say... "Period."
- Ever? Ever?

02:30.498 --> 02:32.674
Okay, say less,
once second.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.980
I felt like it went well
until the very end.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.199
It went left.
Let me-- hold on.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.549
Let me check on Kandi, too.
Hold on.

02:38.549 --> 02:39.985
These bitches
are out here feuding

02:39.985 --> 02:42.510
like J. Lo and Mariah.
I don't know her.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.555
Who is she?
What's your name?

02:44.555 --> 02:45.817
Okay.

02:47.558 --> 02:48.559
Oh, my earring--

02:48.559 --> 02:52.215
my earring don't know me, bitch.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.564
I don't even know
what's wrong with her!

02:53.564 --> 02:56.045
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.438
Yeah.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.004
Why would she keep
bouncing her head in my face?

02:59.004 --> 03:00.310
I don't know. I told her--
I said she shoulda chilled.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.616
Do you know her?

03:01.616 --> 03:03.226
I just met her with Sheree,
like, this week.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.186
Who the is she?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.926
- What is wrong with her?
- Who the is she?

03:07.926 --> 03:09.058
I'm annoyed.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.234
Sanya didn't tell me
that this girl,

03:11.234 --> 03:13.715
who I do not know,
has an issue with me.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.325
Like, why would you have us
both at the party

03:15.325 --> 03:17.022
and not give me a heads up?

03:17.022 --> 03:20.765
Hey, you just let me
walk into mess.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.814
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me tell you something.

03:25.814 --> 03:30.166
You got a-- this, right here,
White Hennessy, cigars--

03:30.166 --> 03:31.472
So, it's gonna
have me right?

03:31.472 --> 03:34.997
- Oh, bro, come on, man.
- Appreciate it, bro.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.607
- Sheree, chile.
- What?

03:36.607 --> 03:38.218
- What?
- You just missed it.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.306
- Yeah.
- Courtney and Kandi--

03:39.306 --> 03:40.698
Kandi was just about
to fight her.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.439
- What?
- Kandi don't even fight.
Where are they?

03:42.439 --> 03:43.658
Kandi just walked out
but come on.

03:43.658 --> 03:44.876
She's over here.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.054
Excuse us. I'm sorry.
What's going on?

03:49.054 --> 03:50.273
This girl, she was like,

03:50.273 --> 03:51.405
"You need to calm
the down."

03:51.405 --> 03:52.710
So, I said--
- What?

03:52.710 --> 03:53.581
- I was-- I was like--
- She's very animated

03:53.581 --> 03:54.582
when she talks.
- Yeah.

03:54.582 --> 03:55.539
She's like very--
very animated.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.541
She is. Yeah. Hello.
How are you?

03:57.541 --> 03:59.848
Yes. It's very-- it's very--
it's very animated.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.330
Oh!

04:03.330 --> 04:04.766
- I was like--
- Redhead Kandi.

04:04.766 --> 04:05.984
Kandi, she be like,

04:05.984 --> 04:07.290
"I don't know
who you're doing that to."

04:07.290 --> 04:08.639
I said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?"

04:08.639 --> 04:10.511
- Oh, Lord...
- Give me another--

04:10.511 --> 04:13.122
I gotta take my--
let me show y'all how to win.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.428
- All right.
- I'm on a roll.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.952
This is Birkin money.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.607
Two.

04:19.607 --> 04:22.349
Oh, you're
taking my money.

04:22.349 --> 04:26.048
Now, how am I
the only one behaving?

04:26.048 --> 04:28.050
I'm appalled.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.356
Therapy works, y'all.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.879
I'm telling you.
Seek it.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.359
- Lovely.
- Hey.

04:32.359 --> 04:35.362
Oh!
You look amazing.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.928
- You look sexy.
- Thank you.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.629
- I won.
- You won.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.065
Big money.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.067
Oh, here she goes.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.068
What's going on?

04:46.068 --> 04:47.374
So, my friend
is very upset,

04:47.374 --> 04:50.507
so I'm just wondering why
she's in this space,

04:50.507 --> 04:51.856
right now--
- Okay, I missed all that.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.075
What happened?

04:53.075 --> 04:54.511
We don't have to
relive it, right now.

04:54.511 --> 04:55.947
All right. Change of outfit
to change the vibe.

04:55.947 --> 04:59.951
- Whoo!
- Yes!

04:59.951 --> 05:01.301
- Are we good?
- We're good.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.389
So, you know, the girls
pulled me to the side

05:02.389 --> 05:04.521
to talk about Martell.
- Yes.

05:04.521 --> 05:07.394
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Dating someone in Atlanta.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.873
You always said
you wanna know.

05:08.873 --> 05:11.702
I do, but I don't want
to know part of the story.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.008
I need you to have
all your receipts.

05:15.445 --> 05:16.925
All right, y'all.
I'm out. I'm out.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.318
Why are you leaving?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.841
It's my husband's birthday.
It's about him.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.538
Not that this matters
but how did you feel

05:21.538 --> 05:23.366
about him
sliding up in her DMs?

05:23.366 --> 05:24.802
- So, he tried to DM you.
- And she didn't accept it.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.282
- I don't follow him.
- There it is.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.589
- Come here, security.
- Security.

05:28.589 --> 05:31.374
She's saying that you tried
to send her a message.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.419
And it was erased.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.072
Can-can-can--
this yours?

05:34.072 --> 05:34.812
- It's my phone.
- Can she talk?

05:36.727 --> 05:38.599
- I'm scared of you.
- I don't know.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.165
- No, but that was--
- I guess, if someone
accusing you of something,

05:40.165 --> 05:41.253
I guess you can, um,
defend yourself.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.777
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.131
- Wait, Who? Who? Wait, what?
- What is he talking about?

05:49.131 --> 05:50.741
You talking about me?

05:50.741 --> 05:52.656
Are you serious?

05:52.656 --> 05:54.963
He just, basically,
now he just insulted me,

05:54.963 --> 05:57.052
talking about she probably
accepted everybody's message.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.967
Hey, are you denying
that you slid in there?

05:58.967 --> 06:00.664
What? Yeah, I--

06:00.664 --> 06:02.231
- I don't know you.
- Okay, cool.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.450
- Where is the message?
- He's denying

06:03.450 --> 06:04.668
that he sent you a message.
Pull it up.

06:04.668 --> 06:08.716
Five minutes ago--
hold on.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.326
I did DM you.
I'm sorry.

06:10.326 --> 06:11.414
I didn't know
what you look like.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.459
I'm sorry.
That was two years ago.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.721
Wait.
Wait a second.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.331
Look, two years ago,
not six months ago.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.464
I'm sorry. It-it was two--
- I said at least six.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.161
Read it.
It was two years ago.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.380
I said at least six--

06:20.380 --> 06:21.685
No, no, it's
from two years ago,

06:21.685 --> 06:23.426
not six months ago.
- Okay.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.907
Martell showing his version
of the DM

06:25.907 --> 06:27.387
means nothing to me.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.650
He could have easily deleted
the other part

06:29.650 --> 06:32.348
that she told us about.
I saw her DM.

06:32.348 --> 06:33.610
She had not
messed with it.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.090
She had not touched it
at all.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.831
- There he is.
- Hit accept.

06:36.831 --> 06:37.919
- Where is the message?
- Oh, he deleted it.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.094
He deleted it.
- Oh, he deleted it.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.617
She would have
had to have accepted it

06:40.617 --> 06:42.489
to have deleted anything.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.708
Whatever it was,
you did it.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.496
- Wait a minute.
- I'm talking about it because--

06:49.496 --> 06:51.454
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- I'm sorry, what.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.412
I said, I don't care if
I was trying to you

06:52.412 --> 06:53.413
two years ago.
- Excuse me.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.414
Why are you talking
about it?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.503
Whoa. Wait.
Hold on! Hold on!

06:56.503 --> 06:58.026
- I'm just sayin'.
- I'm sorry...

06:58.026 --> 06:59.723
Did you just curse at me?
- I said if I--

06:59.723 --> 07:01.290
What did you say to this
queen standing in front of you?

07:01.290 --> 07:02.683
I said--
You said six months ago.

07:02.683 --> 07:03.814
You're an asshole!
You did it to your ex-wife,

07:03.814 --> 07:04.989
and you're gonna do it
to Sheree!

07:04.989 --> 07:07.035
You said-- you said
six months ago.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.125
Don't entertain that.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.300
Let gonna say somethin',
real quick.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.432
Let me say it, real quick.
Oh, my gosh.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
Sheree, that's the same
type of man

07:14.434 --> 07:16.087
that you have
dealt with before.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.395
Have I ever choked you?

07:19.395 --> 07:21.179
You have.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.354
Could you still breathe?

07:22.354 --> 07:23.791
That's not funny.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.706
Maybe I didn't choke you
hard enough.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.316
But the point is,
he's talking to me--

07:27.316 --> 07:29.405
- I-- yes.
- Like he's gonna
eventually talk to you!

07:29.405 --> 07:30.841
I'm gonna get him
straightened out.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.408
But listen, y'all are trying
to create a narrative

07:32.408 --> 07:33.714
about some sh--
that happened two years ago

07:33.714 --> 07:35.367
when he said,
"Thank you for your kind words."

07:35.367 --> 07:36.804
Yes. Girl, he was also--
he was also--

07:36.804 --> 07:39.154
I'm gonna get him
to straighten this out.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.329
Exactly.
So, why bring it up?

07:40.329 --> 07:41.548
A DM is trying
to open a conversation.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.420
Exactly.
So, why bring it up?

07:44.420 --> 07:45.856
I am very heated.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.684
All I want to do
was bring my guy

07:47.684 --> 07:50.557
and introduce him to my girls
who's been asking about him,

07:50.557 --> 07:51.862
and it went left.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.603
I'm not happy with her
trying to embarrass me

07:53.603 --> 07:56.127
or Martell at this party.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.477

I was, like,
really offended

08:08.705 --> 08:10.359
that they were lying
like that, first off.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.273
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, and again,

08:11.273 --> 08:12.361
I just met them.

08:12.361 --> 08:13.667
If someone wants me

08:13.667 --> 08:15.277
they need to
respect me, too,

08:15.277 --> 08:16.278
'cause just they're queens,

08:16.278 --> 08:18.280
I'm a king, too.
Don't lie on me.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.586
I'm not gonna apologize

Ahh, Ni-Ni,
I missed you so much.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.953
Ooh, I like your hair.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.302
Do I get a kiss?

09:24.302 --> 09:25.695
No, no kiss?

09:25.695 --> 09:27.436
You still don't
be giving kisses.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.785
Look what Aniya
made for you.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.918
This is sweet.
Oh, Ni-Ni.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.833
Ni-Ni, did you put
these flowers together?

09:32.833 --> 09:34.530
Did you miss
your brothers?

09:34.530 --> 09:35.662
You did?

09:35.662 --> 09:37.881
So, how was
everything in Chicago?

09:40.057 --> 09:41.581
I think I've been
pretty strong through it,

09:41.581 --> 09:44.061
but, like, literally,
when I go back to Chicago,

09:44.061 --> 09:46.803
it's like, oh, wow.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.109
Daddy is in
a nursing home.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.590
When I got there, he was
sitting at a table,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.243
and it's like no one
is talking to him.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.071
Nobody is engaging him.
He's just in a wheelchair,

09:54.071 --> 09:55.986
which is still crazy to me
that my dad is in a wheelchair

09:55.986 --> 09:58.989
'cause when he went in,
he was still walking.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.948
My father has
Alzheimer's disease.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.863
He's living in
a nursing home,

10:02.863 --> 10:04.865
which has been really hard
for my mom, as well.

10:04.865 --> 10:07.389
Of course, as a family,
we worry about my mom, too,

10:07.389 --> 10:08.695
and her strength.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.174
It's just a lot
on us, right now.

10:10.174 --> 10:11.872
It was really important
for me to be there for them.

10:11.872 --> 10:14.048
So, of course, I had
a breakdown then.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.877
Um, and then
once my mom got there,

10:16.877 --> 10:18.966
it was so amazing 'cause it
felt like he started

10:18.966 --> 10:21.621
to remember us
a little bit,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.579
and then I played him
the song.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.146
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.114
That girl can sing,
can't she?

10:37.114 --> 10:38.899
Yeah, sing it.

10:38.899 --> 10:41.162
My dad does not
recognize me all the time,

10:41.162 --> 10:44.731
but when he heard me singing
and knew that it was me,

10:44.731 --> 10:47.037
I was extremely emotional

10:47.037 --> 10:49.823
because that has been
our connection my whole life.

10:49.823 --> 10:52.695
He was in, like, a singing group
back in high school,

10:52.695 --> 10:55.829
so I kinda always felt like
I was living his dream.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.222
I would have loved for him
to see all that I'm doing now,

10:58.222 --> 10:59.659
but I am doing it for him.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.922
I know how hard you
worked even to

11:01.922 --> 11:04.272
even get to a place to,
like, releasing music.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.100
I want fruit.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.536
- You want more fruit?
- Go get some fruit.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.712
You can have at it.
Fruit is all good.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.235
It's all yours, baby.
Take as much as you want.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.194
Um, I'm nervous.
I'm nervous because, like,

11:13.194 --> 11:16.719
there have been so many times
that I did music,

11:16.719 --> 11:18.025
or I tried to do music.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.896
Every time things
didn't pan out,

11:19.896 --> 11:22.638
it was like my confidence
broke down.

11:22.638 --> 11:23.770
I'm not saying
I'm not ready.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.293
I'm just saying
I need to get ready.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.295
First and foremost, you are
extremely talented, babe.

11:27.295 --> 11:29.253
Like, I wanna be able
to nurture your gift.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.559
Yes, I'm an actress.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.648
However, I've
always done music.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.258
It is such a passion of mine,

11:34.258 --> 11:36.957
but it just never really, like,
turned into a career for me.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.654
I mean, I've been
writing and recording

11:38.654 --> 11:40.482
since the age of three.

11:40.482 --> 11:41.831
Music lives inside of me.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.312
I went on to be signed
to so many labels,

11:44.312 --> 11:45.574
Slip-n-Slide.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.924
I was in a girl group
called Mo'Tempo.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.146
Oh, most definitely.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.843
I recently released
my new single.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.497
It's called,
"You Already Know."

11:55.497 --> 11:57.891
♪ 'Cause you already know

11:57.891 --> 12:00.981

We are.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.246
We really are
in a good place.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.638
We're doing music.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.815
So, we've not had to focus
so much on our issues,

12:08.815 --> 12:11.992
and I feel like, for that,
we're in, you know,

12:11.992 --> 12:13.080
the best place
we've been in, I think,

12:13.080 --> 12:15.299
in the whole eight years.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.694
What did I miss, though,
while I was away?

12:18.694 --> 12:20.391
You went to Ross's party.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.741
How was it?
- Yeah. So, yeah.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.568

fresh to death, you know.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.179
Anybody try
to hit on you?

12:25.179 --> 12:27.572
No, I was good, but it was--
it was good seeing everyone.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.270

Courtney, there

12:29.270 --> 12:30.358

12:31.576 --> 12:32.752

right now,

12:32.752 --> 12:33.970
literally.
- No, literally.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.319
She's like,
my cousin, Jones.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.147
I was like stop playing.

12:37.147 --> 12:40.672
My dad's sister is
Ralph's grand-aunt.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.326
As soon as somebody says
we're cousins,

12:42.326 --> 12:43.806
then we're all family.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.025
So, that's just crazy.
I'm sad I missed it now.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.417
Yeah, it's
a small world, you know.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.984
- Mommy? Mama?
- So, what happened with Kandi?

12:47.984 --> 12:49.072
I was like,
what is going on?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.160
I'm seeing this
on the Internet.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.553
I was about to have
to check on you.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.598
Who made Kandi mad?

12:53.598 --> 12:55.862
I heard it
was my cousin.

12:57.646 --> 13:00.170
Oh, my God,
your cousin fought Kandi.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.998
She like to
fight people, huh?

13:01.998 --> 13:03.739
Y'all really are related.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.133

How are you?
- I'm good.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.941
- Good.
- What's up?

13:31.941 --> 13:33.769
Not much. You tired?

13:33.769 --> 13:34.944
- I'm all right.
- Okay.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.425
Just running around

13:37.425 --> 13:39.253
I know. Me, too.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.907
It's been hectic.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.865
- Welcome to El Valle.
- Hi. How are you?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.562
Can we get some ceviche?

13:44.562 --> 13:45.650
Yes.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.087
I wanna try
the corn soup.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.915
Literally, Deucey still
remembers Blaze.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.351
- Really?
- Yes.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.831
Yeah, we gotta do
some more stuff with the kids.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.875
Yes, yeah.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.138
So, we did Disney.
- We did Disney.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.837
Kandi actually sent
a group text to all of us

13:57.837 --> 13:59.708
inviting us
to come to Disney.

13:59.708 --> 14:00.927
I reached out to her,
and she was like,

14:00.927 --> 14:02.319
"Sure, Nobody else responded.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.321
If you guys wanna come,
let's do it."

14:04.321 --> 14:05.801
It was epic.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.325
And that was mad fun.
- Super fun.

14:08.325 --> 14:11.415
In the past year, I have
had the opportunity

14:11.415 --> 14:14.592
to hang out with Sanya
outside of the group,

14:14.592 --> 14:16.464
and I have
a great time with her.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.987
Our families get along.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.728
It's-it's all good.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.034
But where is
our next trip?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.470
Well, I don't know
if I really have time

14:22.470 --> 14:24.037
to, uh, do anything fun.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.690
Bossing up, as usual.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.171
Like, today should have been
a day of being able to relax,

14:28.171 --> 14:29.694
and it wasn't.
- It wasn't. Yeah.

14:29.694 --> 14:33.133
Like, I have a contract
that I need to read through.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.222
I needed to go
through my taxes.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.788
That's no fun.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.703
Bravo Con this week.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.401
- Oh, you going, too?
- Yes.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.533
Todd is going, right?

14:42.533 --> 14:43.839
How is the family doing?

14:43.839 --> 14:45.101
It's starting to get
a little tricky now

14:45.101 --> 14:47.060
because my husband
is ready to be like,

14:47.060 --> 14:49.062
yo, I just want my own space,
be the man of the house,

14:49.062 --> 14:50.846
and the king of
my own castle.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.587
It's not about them
being here.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.850
It's about us
building here.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.983
Now, it's time
to be on our own.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.332
But on the other hand,
I'm talking to my mom,

14:58.332 --> 15:00.595
and she's like, "I just came
back from Florida,

15:00.595 --> 15:02.423
and my heart is in Florida."

15:02.423 --> 15:03.946
She wants to move, too.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.426
Damn.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.036
But it's like, sh--,
am I the only that wants that?

15:07.036 --> 15:08.951
But I don't know.
- What's your sister wanna do?

15:08.951 --> 15:11.127
Oh, my sister has
been over us, girl.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.869
I feel very torn about
the whole situation.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.784
So, we've just
crossed a year.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.612
I think we said
a year or two years

15:17.612 --> 15:18.830
for the family to move out,

15:18.830 --> 15:20.615
and we're still not
at two years yet.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.966
So, I don't understand
what the big fuss is all about.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.968
I don't know what's
gonna happen from here on.

15:25.968 --> 15:29.450
This is tricky for me
because, on the one hand,

15:29.450 --> 15:32.496
I 100% want to respect
my husband,

15:32.496 --> 15:35.412
but, at the same time,
I love my family so much,

15:35.412 --> 15:38.111
and I think that
the potential we have

15:38.111 --> 15:40.243
to work together
and do great things,

15:40.243 --> 15:43.203
I don't think we've even
tapped the surface.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.421
But, you know,
it is what it is.

15:44.421 --> 15:46.336
How-how is everything
with your family?

15:46.336 --> 15:49.296
Todd keep coming up
with a million different
projects to do.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.427
Yes, Jesus.

15:50.427 --> 15:51.863
We kinda bumped heads
a little bit

15:51.863 --> 15:55.258
because he's always having
to put everything into me

15:55.258 --> 15:57.347
and what I wanna do.
- Yeah, right.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.741
And he feels
that I don't put enough

15:59.741 --> 16:02.135
into his dreams.
- Right.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.224
He's been wanting to produce
a movie for a minute.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.529
Oh.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.054
He wants me to, like,
get behind it 100%.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.359
- Right.
- 'Cause, you know, like,

16:09.359 --> 16:10.360
my days can get
caught up with [indistinct],

16:10.360 --> 16:12.101
real quick.
- Easy, yeah.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.016
It's like they don't express
exactly what they want,

16:14.016 --> 16:15.583
so we don't know
what they want,

16:15.583 --> 16:17.106
and then it's so easy to get
caught up in our own stuff.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.499
So, no, trust me,
if anybody gets it,

16:18.499 --> 16:20.109
I get you, girl.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.806
I really want my husband
to understand

16:21.806 --> 16:23.330
that I'm doing
the best that I can,

16:23.330 --> 16:26.942
but I understand
how he feels,

16:26.942 --> 16:30.990
and I'm trying
to be sensitive

16:30.990 --> 16:32.687
to his feelings.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.862
So, yeah.
So, first of all,

16:33.862 --> 16:35.211
what do you think
about the party overall?

16:35.211 --> 16:36.473
Did you have a good time?

16:36.473 --> 16:40.086
- Oh, yeah, well...
- For the most part.

16:40.086 --> 16:43.480
Chile, when she start
doing this,

16:43.480 --> 16:46.353
like, looking like
a----ing bobblehead...

16:48.181 --> 16:50.357
Let me tell you what happened
prior to that moment.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.836
I actually went over
to Sheree's house,

16:51.836 --> 16:53.621
and then Courtney comes over.

16:53.621 --> 16:54.839
She said some things, chile.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.885
She said this place
that y'all go to,

16:56.885 --> 16:58.626
she said that
they invited you there,

16:58.626 --> 16:59.888
and you posted it,

16:59.888 --> 17:01.324
and you brought
the hood out to the place,

17:01.324 --> 17:02.586
and she's like,
"That's why she's making

17:02.586 --> 17:04.327
that kind of content."
- Wait, what?

17:06.503 --> 17:07.939
It is a strict--

17:07.939 --> 17:11.421
Well, she shared a story
about it on her Instagram.

17:11.421 --> 17:15.556
The crowd
the next week, ghetto.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.036
- No!
- No!

17:19.038 --> 17:21.257
When she sat up here
and was talking to you

17:21.257 --> 17:23.042
and said that I was ghetto,

17:23.042 --> 17:24.565
what did you say?
- Mm-hmm.

17:28.177 --> 17:29.831
I said to her,
"Kandi is my friend,"

17:29.831 --> 17:32.181
and I said, "You need to have
a conversation with her,"

17:32.181 --> 17:34.270
and she said she would,
and she did, yes.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.011
So, you didn't
take up for me.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.013
I mean...

17:38.013 --> 17:39.667
Ghetto.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.538
- No.
- No, no.

17:43.671 --> 17:46.021
I, no, I-I did.
I felt like I told her,

17:46.021 --> 17:47.414
especially when she was
saying it, I said,

17:47.414 --> 17:49.590
"I don't feel like Kandi
would say that."

17:49.590 --> 17:50.939
I doubt it.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.333
I doubt that Sanya
really had my back.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.943
To be honest,
I didn't feel like

17:54.943 --> 17:56.901
she was calling Kandi ghetto.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.381
Almost, to me, I thought
she was trying

17:58.381 --> 18:00.166
to make reference to the fact
that everybody said

18:00.166 --> 18:02.168
Kandi was worldwide
last year.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.821
And, to her,
she was like,

18:03.821 --> 18:04.996
well, the folks she brought out
didn't look very worldwide.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.215
Excuse me... Okay.

18:06.215 --> 18:08.348
Yeah, you already
over there hanging out

18:08.348 --> 18:11.351
with Marlo and Sheree,
and I know how they do.

18:11.351 --> 18:14.049
So, you probably just
be over there, hee-hee.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.269
"Oh, y'all are so dirty."

18:16.269 --> 18:19.054
No, I need somebody who is
really gonna defend me.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.186
That was your
taking up for somebody

18:20.186 --> 18:21.404
when they
call me ghetto?

18:21.404 --> 18:23.537
She didn't
call you ghetto.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.060
She said your
followers were ghetto.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.410
These fake classy bitches
kill me.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.066
Coming up...

18:31.066 --> 18:34.156
Okay, we're in the house
of She by Sheree.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.810
Listen. So, what
happened the other day?

18:46.299 --> 18:47.604
♪ You already know

18:47.604 --> 18:49.519

18:50.564 --> 18:51.565
Okay, tell me.
What do you think?

18:51.565 --> 18:52.914
Let's see if you
pick what I pick.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.350
I like the
python better.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.786
Yes, that's
what I picked.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.397
Okay, okay.

18:57.397 --> 19:00.182
I taught you well, baby.
I found this,

19:00.182 --> 19:02.010
and then we'll give 'em
this flashlight

19:02.010 --> 19:03.403
in case the lights go off.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.934
I made breakfast.
- Looks good. Looks good.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.457
You ready to get
this exercise in?

19:14.457 --> 19:15.458
I am.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.938
I need it,
but I do want eggs.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.331
Can I eat some
eggs before?

19:18.331 --> 19:19.375
No, no, no, no, no.
Let's cut half of that.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.160
Ralph, I'm gonna
give you some.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.291
Do you want some?
- No, I'm not eating that.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.423

- Okay.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.692
Where you goin', handsome?

19:31.692 --> 19:33.346
I miss you, babe.
You look so good.

19:33.346 --> 19:34.651
A little bit tough with
both of us being gone

19:34.651 --> 19:36.566
with Deuce like...

19:40.483 --> 19:42.442
Yeah, we leave
and we start replacing.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.878
Yeah.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.575
How we gonna make this baby
if you always traveling?

19:45.575 --> 19:47.316
I can't even get
a Facetime with my man,

19:47.316 --> 19:49.188
much less get
some baby time.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.453
Well, we can't practice
when you're there either, sir.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.585
So, I feel like
I'm in a good place

19:55.585 --> 19:57.805
about having baby
number two,

19:57.805 --> 20:00.199
but the fact that Ross
is always gone to Austin

20:00.199 --> 20:03.506
working on Ross Elite
certainly has me

20:03.506 --> 20:06.117
second guessing if we're
making the right decision,

20:06.117 --> 20:07.902
and it's making it
really hard for us

20:07.902 --> 20:09.338
to work on
baby number two,

20:09.338 --> 20:11.862
but if it's meant
to be, it'll be.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.300
All right.
I love you. I love you.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.694
I miss you.
Keep grinding.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.440
Is anybody here? Hello?

20:24.440 --> 20:26.921
So what you got
planned today?

20:26.921 --> 20:29.010
Gonna taste some food.

20:29.010 --> 20:32.231
Kinda shifted some of the--
some of the menu items.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.233
- Mm-hmm.
- Added some things.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.886
Trying to rejigger
it a little bit.

20:35.886 --> 20:38.541
I think you did an amazing job
putting this place together,

20:38.541 --> 20:42.328
but, for some reason,
it's not, like, connecting

20:42.328 --> 20:44.243
as, like, our other
restaurant is.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.287
It doesn't mean
it can't pop.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.723
Like, I know it can pop,

20:46.723 --> 20:48.247
but I think we're
gonna be all right.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.640
The side of town
that Blaze is on

20:50.640 --> 20:54.035
is really more of
the urban side of Atlanta.

20:54.035 --> 20:58.126
You know, when we first opened,
it was more of a hot area,

20:58.126 --> 21:03.740
and then, during the pandemic,
things just kinda got crazy.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.264
We gotta rebuild.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.570
Where is everybody?
Knock-knock.

21:07.570 --> 21:08.963
What's up?
- Hey, Kandi, how are you?

21:08.963 --> 21:10.399
Hey. Hey, Philip.

21:10.399 --> 21:11.357
We're just gettin'
the day started.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.619
How are you?
- How you doin'?

21:12.619 --> 21:14.316
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you, too.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.579
- How you doing, sir?
- I'm good. I'm chilling.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.364
So, me and Philip
got together,

21:18.364 --> 21:19.843
and we tweaked
some menu items.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.845
When you come in sometimes,
the sh-- just feels real,

21:21.845 --> 21:24.065
like--
- Blah.

21:24.065 --> 21:25.458
Well, I'm gonna let you try
some of this new food.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.633
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.503
And you can tell us
what you think.

21:27.503 --> 21:28.374
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.418
All right.
Come on, man.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.724
Don't make me
look bad in here.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.682
Oh, my gosh.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.293
Are you ready for
the Mexican restaurant?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.598
No, I'm not.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.731
Why do you keep opening
more restaurants?

21:37.731 --> 21:39.472
I've made more money
than I've ever made in my life

21:39.472 --> 21:40.995
off of restaurants.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.258
So, it's a money thing.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.651
Yeah, basically.

21:44.651 --> 21:47.175
But, I mean, realistically,

21:47.175 --> 21:51.092
your passion are
your creative ideas,

21:51.092 --> 21:53.703
your TV shows,
your movie ideas.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.923
- That's what I wanna do.
- Mm-hmm.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.621
It's okay if I make money
through restaurants.

21:58.621 --> 22:01.885
I can stack my money
and just finance my own movie.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.453
So, I'm gonna open up
the Mexican restaurant

22:04.453 --> 22:05.715
down the block.

22:05.715 --> 22:11.330
You ready for Ole-G,
taco Tuesdays.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.202
Right after that,
it's gonna be Ace's Pizza.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.508
What up? What up?
What up? What up?

22:15.508 --> 22:17.031
- Hello.
- What's going on?

22:17.031 --> 22:19.990
What's up? Muah.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.427
What's going on?

22:21.427 --> 22:23.167
Oh, man,
what's going on?

22:23.167 --> 22:24.473
Nothin' too much.
Nothin' too much.

22:24.473 --> 22:25.866
How y'all been?
- I'm good. How you feeling?

22:25.866 --> 22:27.084
Chillin'.

22:27.084 --> 22:30.305
- It is what it is.
- One day at a time.

22:30.305 --> 22:31.654
- That's it.
- That's it.

22:31.654 --> 22:34.091
So, we about to--

22:34.091 --> 22:35.963
we rejiggered
the menu some.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.356
- Okay.
- Um...

22:37.356 --> 22:39.619
we added a couple of things,
some new appetizers,

22:39.619 --> 22:41.490
a couple of things,
or whatever.

22:41.490 --> 22:42.578
So, we're gonna taste
some of this food.

22:42.578 --> 22:43.579
It better be good.

22:43.579 --> 22:44.885
They better not
embarrass me.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.496
Uh-oh.
It looks pretty good.

22:47.496 --> 22:48.932
Looks pretty good.

22:48.932 --> 22:51.326
Okay, right here,
we have the shrimp scampi.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.241
These are the Blaze wings.
- Okay.

22:53.241 --> 22:57.114
Then right here, we have
the twice-baked baked potato,

22:57.114 --> 22:58.464
crab burger.
- Okay.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.813
And then that's
just another wing.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.381
Mmm.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.081
- A question.
- What?

23:07.081 --> 23:08.125
What you need, cuz?

23:13.087 --> 23:14.828
- We can't.
- We're not talking about it.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.569
'Cause it's
a legal situation.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.794
Okay, I know the crime rate
is rising in Atlanta,

23:24.794 --> 23:27.710
but we don't want it to be
at any of Kandi's restaurants.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.495
It's nothing
more scary than hearing

23:29.495 --> 23:31.540
that somethin' like that
happened at your business.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.802
We don't know when
we go to Old Lady Gang

23:32.802 --> 23:36.023
if we're going to get
biscuits or bullets.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.764
It's still legal.
You know what I mean?

23:37.764 --> 23:40.506
Like, I don't want to out--
misspeak about--

23:40.506 --> 23:41.637
you know what I'm saying?

23:41.637 --> 23:42.943
There was a gentleman.

23:42.943 --> 23:45.293
Basically, he came
to work late,

23:45.293 --> 23:47.034
and he came
to work intoxicated.

23:47.034 --> 23:50.429
He got a little irate
with my cousin,

23:50.429 --> 23:52.474
who was kitchen manager.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.171
They went outside.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.304
The guy shot my cousin.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.827
How you been
feeling, though?

23:57.827 --> 23:59.220
You good?

23:59.220 --> 24:01.701
Yeah, I'm--
I'm all right.

24:01.701 --> 24:04.617
You never wanna have
anything like that

24:04.617 --> 24:07.924
to be associated with any
of your businesses,

24:07.924 --> 24:12.189
but, unfortunately, it's been
happening a lot in Atlanta.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.104
Violence has been
on a rise,

24:14.104 --> 24:18.326
but it did not stop people
from wanting to support us,

24:18.326 --> 24:19.980
which I am grateful
for that.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.424
♪ just because
you're wanting me ♪

24:29.424 --> 24:30.904
♪ and you're used to
getting it ♪

24:30.904 --> 24:32.819
♪ You think I'm just gonna
give it up to you ♪

24:32.819 --> 24:34.473
♪ just

24:34.473 --> 24:36.736
♪ you must've got
me confused ♪

24:36.736 --> 24:39.695
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.392
- Eyes on the ball.
- Where are they?

24:41.392 --> 24:43.351
You ready?

24:43.351 --> 24:45.135
Whoo!

24:45.135 --> 24:47.398
Do your dance. Do your dance.
- Oh, there they are.

24:50.706 --> 24:52.839
No, go, Brooklyn.
They're here.

24:52.839 --> 24:54.710
- Give me hugs, girl. Come here.
- Say hi.

24:54.710 --> 24:55.972
Hi, beautiful.
I like your outfit.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.365
She's trying to take
her-her jacket off.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.280
I-I see it, girl.
I see it.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.890
Look at our little girls.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.196
Oh, Brooklyn, you know
how to play tennis?

25:02.196 --> 25:03.545
- Oh, where is my racket?
- Can you show us,

25:03.545 --> 25:04.894
because we really don't--
we're more of, like,

25:04.894 --> 25:06.592
football girls.
- What do you--

25:06.592 --> 25:08.289
what do you call 'em?
- What? WAGs?

25:08.289 --> 25:09.812
WAGs.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.118
You little WAG, you.
- Well, I was telling Nazzie--

25:11.118 --> 25:14.556
I'm like, Nazzie,
show me daddy's game face.

25:14.556 --> 25:18.778
I love Akilah, honey.

25:18.778 --> 25:21.781
Her daughter and my daughter
are best friends,

25:21.781 --> 25:24.784
and she has become one
of my dearest friends.

25:24.784 --> 25:28.048
Ready? Hit the ball.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.267
- Try and get it. Go get it.
- Brooklyn, go get it.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.660
Good job. Hit it.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.488
- Good job, Brookie.
- Yeah! Yeah!

25:33.488 --> 25:35.142
Whoo!

25:35.142 --> 25:37.405
Okay, same thing, now.

25:37.405 --> 25:38.667
Bring it.

25:38.667 --> 25:41.191
Whoo! Whoo!

25:41.191 --> 25:43.498
All right. Okay,
we definitely have some winners.

25:43.498 --> 25:44.804
- Yes.
- But let's take a little break,

25:44.804 --> 25:47.676
but you guys can
continue to play, okay?

25:47.676 --> 25:49.112
If that fails,
we have the iPads. Okay.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.549
- It's so good to see you.
- You, too.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.593
You look gorgeous,
of course.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.073
Oh, girl.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.422
What's new? Talk to me.

25:54.422 --> 25:55.597
Look, they're happy,
you know.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.120
Yes, they're amazing.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.731
- This is a testament to us.
- Yeah, absolutely.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.950
Because our children
are happy.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.735
You have this
beautiful relationship

26:02.735 --> 26:04.345
with your husband.

26:04.345 --> 26:07.261
When I see you guys together,
it's what I envy for myself.

26:07.261 --> 26:08.784
Yeah.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.004
So, I'm still, like, you know,
trying to get divorced.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.440
- But listen.
- Well, no, I--

26:12.440 --> 26:14.964
During that time, Kenya,
you have been so happy.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.923
And I think some of that
has to do with, you know,

26:16.923 --> 26:18.925
a certain gentleman.
- Yeah.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.274
Have I heard about
this gentleman?

26:20.274 --> 26:21.623
- Yeah, I told you about him.
- Oh, okay, okay.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.931
Monyetta introduced
to me to KMC last year.

26:24.931 --> 26:29.718
He's the CEO and founder
of Kale Me Crazy,

26:29.718 --> 26:32.373
and I-I am, like,
kinda crazy about him.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.809
I mean, you know,

26:33.809 --> 26:38.161
tall, handsome,
kind, funny.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.423
Hmm.

26:39.423 --> 26:41.208
Rrarr.

26:41.208 --> 26:43.427
If this man ends up
being your guy, that's great,

26:43.427 --> 26:46.517
but, if not, there is
so many others, girl.

26:46.517 --> 26:47.475
Yeah.

26:47.475 --> 26:48.998
I will help you
line 'em up.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.130
Well, are you gonna take me
to some football games?

26:50.130 --> 26:52.828
- Girl, yes. Yes, honey.
- Okay, okay.

27:02.925 --> 27:05.275
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.843
- How are you, cutie?
- You look beautiful.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.237
I love these pants.
- Yes, yes.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.935
The sweatsuit is killer.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.155
Yes, yes. Okay.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.199
How have you been?
How was your day?

27:16.199 --> 27:18.071
I've been good.
I've been busy.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.159
Okay, busy.
Hi. How are you?

27:19.159 --> 27:20.290
Good evening.
Good. How are you?

27:20.290 --> 27:21.901
Good evening.
I'm well. Thank you.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.337
Do you guys know what you'd
like to start with tonight?

27:23.337 --> 27:24.904
I'll either do the tuna tartar
or the jumbo shrimp.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.035
I-I was looking
at both of those.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.123
Yeah. So, let's do
both of those.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.298
- Both of those? Okay.
- Yeah.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.082
I can grab these out
of your way then.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.431
All right.

27:30.431 --> 27:31.562
When I tell you
I'm so enjoying being a glamma--

27:31.562 --> 27:33.042
Aww, I love that.

27:33.042 --> 27:35.479
And it's a difference
with when you, of course,

27:35.479 --> 27:36.611
are raising your kids.
- Yeah.

27:36.611 --> 27:37.699
I mean, but being
a grandmother--

27:37.699 --> 27:39.135
Yeah.

27:39.135 --> 27:42.486
Or being a glamma
is such an amazing experience.

27:42.486 --> 27:43.574
Aww.

27:43.574 --> 27:47.578
I am now a glamma,
G-L, not G-R.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.363
She is so precious.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.494
She's so beautiful.

27:50.494 --> 27:51.931
She's always been a good baby

27:51.931 --> 27:53.672
from the day
Kairo brought her home,

27:53.672 --> 27:57.414
and she has completely
won my heart.

27:57.414 --> 27:59.155
- Cheers, my friend.
- To love, happiness.

27:59.155 --> 28:00.809
And all the things, cheers.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.115
- And in great health, cheers.
- Yes.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.377
So, the party
looked-looked amazing.

28:03.377 --> 28:06.728
- Thank you, chile.
- What was the budget?

28:06.728 --> 28:08.556
- There was no budget, honey.
- Honey.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.253
- There was no budget.
- You didn't have no budget.

28:10.253 --> 28:13.474
Budget? What's that?

28:13.474 --> 28:14.823
Girl, it was worth it.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.651
Me and Kandi actually
had dinner the other day.

28:16.651 --> 28:18.087
Like, we got together afterwards.

28:18.087 --> 28:20.350
Kenya said Martell DMed her,
like, six months ago?

28:20.350 --> 28:21.917
So, he's feeling like
he came to your party,

28:21.917 --> 28:23.005
you know, to support.
- Yeah.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.267
But he's being ambushed.

28:24.267 --> 28:27.227
Like, try to go
this whole route of anger,

28:27.227 --> 28:28.881
almost angry.
- Oh, yeah.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.144
Aggressive probably, you know,
the same thing she said to Ross.

28:31.144 --> 28:32.580
Aggressive,
the same thing.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.364
Yelling and cursing--
that's not your definition

28:34.364 --> 28:35.539
of aggressive?

28:35.539 --> 28:37.541
Don't
with my wife.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.065
We can't keep
doing that.

28:39.065 --> 28:40.544
We can't keep putting
these labels on these black men.

28:40.544 --> 28:41.981
This is what-- this is what--
on these men, chile.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.199
He's feeling like
he has to defend him-himself.

28:43.199 --> 28:44.766
And after he realized,
he was like,

28:44.766 --> 28:45.985
"I don't give a

28:45.985 --> 28:47.943
if I tried to you
two years ago."

28:47.943 --> 28:50.032
He said-- yes, he did.
He said that.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.294
Oh, my God,
the party was crazy, right?

28:51.294 --> 28:52.731
Okay, so, wait.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.862
Okay, so, I really--
we never even talked about it.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.908
I really don't even know
what happened.

28:55.908 --> 28:56.952
Martell Jordan
cursing me out.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.301
Yes, oh, my God. Okay.

28:58.301 --> 28:59.433
He DMed me.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.087
I just didn't wanna
keep it from her.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.915
- Right.
- And it was a while ago.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.351
He was like,
"Oh, I didn't DM you."

29:04.351 --> 29:06.353
Like, he was trying to
make it seem like he didn't.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.137
So, this was the first time
you guys, like, met in person.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.791
- Met him in person.
- Okay, and he was at--

29:09.791 --> 29:11.010
and he went off on you
like that?

29:11.010 --> 29:14.317
- Yes.
- Don't come at me

29:14.317 --> 29:15.579
with half-ass----ing
information.

29:15.579 --> 29:16.755
- Yeah, right.
- You ain't got no receipts.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.668
You ain't got this.
You ain't got that.

29:17.668 --> 29:18.757
Right, right.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.149
He may not have
been 100% right.

29:20.149 --> 29:21.803
But you have to take
accountability for your actions.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.152
For your actions, too.

29:23.152 --> 29:25.154
Kenya and I were in
such a great place,

29:25.154 --> 29:27.504
but the stuff she did
with Martell

29:27.504 --> 29:30.029
does not sit well with me.

29:30.029 --> 29:33.162
I don't know where we are,
right now, in our friendship.

29:33.162 --> 29:36.949
After the altercation,
I think that Sheree and I,

29:36.949 --> 29:38.951
being the friends that we are,
we need to sit down

29:38.951 --> 29:40.300
and have a talk.

29:40.300 --> 29:43.042
I was more angry at her
because she didn't go,

29:43.042 --> 29:44.913
"Look, don't talk to
my friends like that."

29:44.913 --> 29:46.654
We both have abusive
relationships in our past.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.177
Yeah.

29:48.177 --> 29:51.833
You're having me looking like
a----ing crazy person!

29:51.833 --> 29:53.226
- How?
- How?

29:53.226 --> 29:55.968
Look at my
mother----ing garage!

29:55.968 --> 29:57.796
You have had this.
- Yeah.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.841
You had a man,
just five minutes ago,

29:59.841 --> 30:01.843
in prison,
that made you look like a fool.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.192
Yeah.

30:03.192 --> 30:06.979
So, I look stupid as ,
crazy as ,

30:06.979 --> 30:09.938
dumb as .

30:09.938 --> 30:11.940
I mean, girl,
she's dick-matized, you know?

30:11.940 --> 30:14.421
That's terrible.
Not at this big age.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.946
Coming up next...

30:17.946 --> 30:18.991
Y'all
ambushed the man!

30:18.991 --> 30:20.166
You can't--
a man should never

30:20.166 --> 30:22.211
speak to a woman
in that way, ever.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.560
So, is it okay for you
to get in his face, though?

30:23.560 --> 30:26.607
But he does not ever
have to be abusive.

Kandi had told me

30:52.546 --> 30:53.852
to come in here.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.722
I was like, man,
I definitely gotta get in here

30:54.722 --> 30:55.810
and have a quick session.

30:55.810 --> 30:56.855
So, now we're here.
- Yeah.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.899
Yeah.

30:57.899 --> 30:58.900
We just put a song independent.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.162

Yeah, let me--

31:18.267 --> 31:20.095
Put it out independent,
the song.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.967
For me, it's just really
building my confidence

31:21.967 --> 31:23.838
and really stepping up my game
to be like

31:23.838 --> 31:25.187
this is what I wanna do.

31:25.187 --> 31:27.668
Doing an EP is my dream.
- Well, why now, you said?

31:27.668 --> 31:30.976
I sang "Happy Birthday"
for one of my friends last year,

31:30.976 --> 31:32.934
and all my notes was on.

31:32.934 --> 31:37.112
♪ Happy birthday Sheree
- Thank you.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.331
And everybody was like,

31:38.331 --> 31:39.419
"Oh, my God,
you have a beautiful voice.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.160
Oh, my God,
why don't you do music?"

31:41.160 --> 31:43.162
And I was like,
why don't I do music, you know?

31:43.162 --> 31:44.990
Do you have, like,
a direction of

31:44.990 --> 31:46.513
what you wanna talk about
on your EP?

31:46.513 --> 31:48.036
Everything I've been through
and that's another reason

31:48.036 --> 31:49.951
why I really
wanna do it now.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.431
Just I have so much
to talk about,

31:51.431 --> 31:53.694
so much to
pour my heart out about,

31:53.694 --> 31:54.913
and music is like therapy.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.523
Like, you know,
get it out.

31:56.523 --> 31:58.351
We gotta talk about
the overall planning strategy,

31:58.351 --> 32:00.048
like, music-wise
and everything else.

32:00.048 --> 32:02.181
So, I wanted her
to come in here real fast

32:02.181 --> 32:04.009
and make sure that
she's ready to go, though.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.488
You know what I'm sayin'?

32:05.488 --> 32:06.489
You know, trying to
find a home where I can, like,

32:06.489 --> 32:07.708
get in when
I need to record.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.188
Yes, okay.

32:09.188 --> 32:11.190
And get back
in the dance studio.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.714
We're gonna shoot a video
to "Already Know."

32:13.714 --> 32:15.107
What inspired the song?

32:15.107 --> 32:16.543
Marriage,
ups and downs of love.

32:16.543 --> 32:17.848
Right.

32:17.848 --> 32:20.068
Like, we have had
an argument or something.

32:20.068 --> 32:22.288
I literally like--
- Oh, word.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.898
'Cause love is hard.

32:23.898 --> 32:24.986
But what's y'all dynamic

32:24.986 --> 32:27.684
is like working together, though?

32:27.684 --> 32:32.037
Um, actually,
the studio is our happy place.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.603
Okay, good.

32:33.603 --> 32:34.604
Like, this probably where
we need to do all our dates.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.649
Okay, that's dope.

32:35.649 --> 32:37.172
Like, it's-it's
our connection.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.392
Music brought a joy
in our life.

32:39.392 --> 32:43.004
I think we're getting
a balance in our marriage.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.440
Communication is better.
- All right, cool.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.746
I'll take that.

32:45.746 --> 32:47.052
Take-take one step
in the right direction.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.227
- I'll take it.
- All right.

32:48.227 --> 32:49.315
That's dope.
- That's where it started,

32:49.315 --> 32:50.403
and then we had kids
and then life.

32:50.403 --> 32:51.534
- Yeah.
- Life happened. Yeah.

32:51.534 --> 32:52.753
And then--
yeah, but it was like--

32:52.753 --> 32:54.015
So, y'all are trying to
get back to that.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.799
Music was a huge part
of our first date.

32:55.799 --> 32:56.713
She told me she sang.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.019
I told her
I play the piano.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.108
It was just the connection
was, like, pure.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.544
Pure.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.068
For me, like, I've been
doing music my whole life,

33:03.068 --> 33:05.374
so it just never really popped
the way I wanted it to,

33:05.374 --> 33:06.897
but music is my passion.
- Right.

33:06.897 --> 33:09.726
So, it's like I can never get
too far away from it.

33:09.726 --> 33:12.033
So, here we are.
- Okay.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.034
Yeah, man.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.166
I-I would love
to work with you.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.558
So, I'm excited to see
what happens.

33:15.558 --> 33:17.038
- Do you vocal produce?
- Yes.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.344
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:18.344 --> 33:19.388
Okay, I need somebody to,
like, produce me.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.041
Yeah, we can do that,
for real.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.129
Yeah.
- Okay.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.217
Oh, so, you just
don't engineer.

33:22.217 --> 33:23.305
You do it all.
- No, man, I had to.

33:23.305 --> 33:24.741
You know what I'm saying?
You know how it go.

33:24.741 --> 33:25.960
You gotta figure it out.
- You gotta do it all. Yeah.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.353
I gotta do it all,
but yes.

33:27.353 --> 33:29.268
Well, I would like to try to,
um, sing my song.

33:29.268 --> 33:32.010
Can I sing it, like,
live on the, um, mic?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.359
- You ready?
- Yeah.

33:33.359 --> 33:34.795
I-I just wanted you
to get a sense of, like,

33:34.795 --> 33:36.231
Drew's sound,
where she's going musically.

33:36.231 --> 33:37.537
Right, yeah.

33:37.537 --> 33:39.104
Bro, matter of fact,
pull the keyboard up.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.583
I'll play it for you,
real quick.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.107
Oh, like a real--
the whole keyboard?

33:42.107 --> 33:43.282
I'll pull--
I'll pull the whole thing up,

33:43.282 --> 33:44.805
if you got it.
- All right.

33:44.805 --> 33:45.893
Yeah, all right.
Let's see.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.503
Now, it's like
full circle moment.

33:47.503 --> 33:50.028
We're on a journey of, like,
putting this music out together.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.377
We recorded it together.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.682
Hopefully, we're gonna
take it all the way

33:52.682 --> 33:53.988
to the top together.

33:53.988 --> 33:57.731

34:23.191 --> 34:25.367

34:27.891 --> 34:29.197
That really was it.

34:29.197 --> 34:29.980

How are you?

34:45.561 --> 34:47.911
Brie is
our package packer.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.261
Yes.

34:49.261 --> 34:50.566
So, on the tablet here,
it says how many orders

34:50.566 --> 34:52.655
we have to ship today for you,

34:52.655 --> 34:54.701
but all of it
is ready to ship.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.355
First of all,
they look wrinkled.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.965
Why-why are they wrinkled?

34:57.965 --> 35:01.708
Oh, my gosh how they
sending stuff like this, though?

35:01.708 --> 35:03.536
I would prefer to
steam this first

35:03.536 --> 35:05.538
just so the customer is not
getting a wrinkled product.

35:05.538 --> 35:06.930
Yeah, yeah.
Is that a extra charge?

35:06.930 --> 35:08.149
Of course.

35:08.149 --> 35:10.760
- Oh, Lord, I'm on a budget.
- Of course.

35:10.760 --> 35:16.201
I was on cloud 1,010
after my fashion show launch.

35:20.335 --> 35:23.208
I had so much love,
so much support coming in

35:23.208 --> 35:25.384
for She by Sheree
that the website crashed.

35:25.384 --> 35:30.084
I felt like I lost
a lot of money sh--.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.741
Everybody and their mama
had somethin' to say.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.395
You know, we recently
did a report on

35:36.395 --> 35:38.962
She by Sheree,
the website not being available

35:38.962 --> 35:40.399
for purchasing anything.

35:40.399 --> 35:43.750
It was already on hold
for 14 years.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.753
So, we just gotta
keep the momentum up.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.102
To the moon, baby.

35:53.281 --> 35:56.241
Okay, we're in the house
of She by Sheree.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.416
It looks so cool.
- You look amazing.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.765
- Thank you. You, too, baby.
- Yes.

35:58.765 --> 35:59.592
I wanted to bring you--
this is one of--

35:59.592 --> 36:00.854
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.

36:00.854 --> 36:02.595
So, you're doing
your own quality control,

36:02.595 --> 36:04.074
or you're just looking.

36:04.074 --> 36:04.988
No, I'm doing it all by--
everything's by myself.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.207
Oh, that's cute.

36:06.207 --> 36:07.730
Those are cute.
- Um--

36:07.730 --> 36:10.385
This looks like
a Dallas Cowboys star.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.560
Oh, you know what?

36:11.560 --> 36:12.779
Almost. Oh, wait, wait.
- It reminds me.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.041
Is that the game
you were just at?

36:14.041 --> 36:15.521
Yes.

36:15.521 --> 36:17.000
Oh, no wonder you got
Dallas Cowboys on the mind.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.351
Wait, tell me. Okay.
- It was so much fun.

36:19.351 --> 36:20.787
So, tell me about this.
So, you went with a guy.

36:20.787 --> 36:23.268
So, you know I did this
huge commercial

36:23.268 --> 36:25.618
for Direct TV with, um,

36:25.618 --> 36:27.837
Teresa and Kyle.
- Oh, I love that commercial.

36:27.837 --> 36:30.144
- We shot it in L.A., um--
- Mm-hmm.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.493
With the Dallas Cowboys.

36:31.493 --> 36:33.278
So, it was Dak Prescott,
who is the quarterback.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.496
Right.

36:34.496 --> 36:36.368
But I came on the set.
I'm like, oh, my.

36:36.368 --> 36:38.587
Like, that's
a good-looking man,

36:38.587 --> 36:39.588
right there.
- Yeah.

36:39.588 --> 36:40.981
But I had a lot of fun.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.635
So, how is the guy that
Monyetta set you up with?

36:42.635 --> 36:44.419
Definitely a lotta
chemistry there,

36:44.419 --> 36:46.421
and it's exciting.
I just feel good.

36:46.421 --> 36:47.857
Like, I just
feel more alive.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.598
Like, I feel like
I'm ready to date.

36:49.598 --> 36:50.686
- That's what you should do.
- Yeah.

36:50.686 --> 36:52.384
Dating, having fun,
enjoying life.

36:52.384 --> 36:54.168
Speaking of relationships, miss.

36:54.168 --> 36:55.517
- What?
- You're claiming.

36:55.517 --> 36:56.562
You're being claimed.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

36:56.562 --> 36:58.303
No, I am--
we're dating.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.348
So, the same thing.
- Hmm, I don't think--

37:00.348 --> 37:01.741
- No.
- That looks like dating.

37:01.741 --> 37:04.134
So, you have--
you have a lot in common?

37:04.134 --> 37:06.354
We do. We do.

37:06.354 --> 37:07.834
And his birth--
he's a Capricorn, as well.

37:07.834 --> 37:09.009
His birthday is two days
after mine.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.185
Oh, okay. I get along
with Capricorns.

37:11.185 --> 37:13.405
That's, like,
a little weird to me

37:13.405 --> 37:14.493
that he's a Capricorn.
- Now, what makes you think

37:14.493 --> 37:15.624
you won't get--
listen.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.017
So, what happened
the other day?

37:17.017 --> 37:18.192
Let's talk about that.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.628
I was shocked because
I wasn't like

37:19.628 --> 37:20.760
I was coming for him.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.283
It didn't have
to go there.

37:22.283 --> 37:23.632
- Okay.
- That didn't--

37:23.632 --> 37:24.677
So, when-when did I deserve
to be cursed out?

37:24.677 --> 37:25.808
I'm waiting for that part.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.201
So, both of you guys
got elevated.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.290
What happened is,
he DMed me.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.465
- Mm-hmm.
- And then

37:30.465 --> 37:31.945
I'm not gonna
accept this DM

37:31.945 --> 37:34.426
because I remember
watching his show,

37:34.426 --> 37:37.080
and I didn't really care
for how things happened

37:37.080 --> 37:38.734
with he and his wife.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.388
To be honest with you, I think
you would get along with him.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.824
He was excited
to meet everybody,

37:41.824 --> 37:43.043
but it started gettin'
a little loud.

37:43.043 --> 37:45.045
He's feeling like people
are ambushing him.

37:45.045 --> 37:46.699
Like, what the hell
did I just walk into?

37:46.699 --> 37:49.354
I don't know him,
and I don't wanna

37:49.354 --> 37:51.530
get to know him,
and that's it.

37:57.927 --> 37:59.451
and I don't wanna
get to know him.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.409
We have talked
so many times.

38:01.409 --> 38:04.325
Not one time
did you ever say,

38:04.325 --> 38:05.848
"Sheree,
this happened."

38:05.848 --> 38:08.590
I didn't think about it
until I saw you two together,

38:08.590 --> 38:10.505
and it-and it--
I asked him,

38:10.505 --> 38:11.724
was this a thing?

38:11.724 --> 38:13.378
I had already saw
the, uh, message.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.336
He showed me the DM.

38:15.336 --> 38:16.642
You said six months.
- I said at least--

38:16.642 --> 38:17.817
- He did not--
- It was over six months ago.

38:17.817 --> 38:18.948
You said it was
about six months.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.385
I don't know
how long ago it was.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.648
It was at least--
at least six months ago.

38:22.648 --> 38:23.605
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:23.605 --> 38:24.867
When I first
met Martell,

38:24.867 --> 38:26.608
we literally talked
about everything,

38:26.608 --> 38:27.870
so he told me about that,
you know,

38:27.870 --> 38:29.698
one time he had, uh,
DMed Kenya.

38:29.698 --> 38:32.701
That's why I was very low-key
and funny with her.

38:32.701 --> 38:33.615
Like, "Girl,
what did it say?

38:33.615 --> 38:34.747
Like, what did he say?"

38:34.747 --> 38:36.052
'Cause I knew
it wasn't flirtatious.

38:36.052 --> 38:37.793
It was pre-you, though.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.186
Yeah. So, that's
what I'm saying.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.535
It didn't even have to come up.
- It was pre-you.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.972
What was offensive to him
to where he felt like

38:42.972 --> 38:45.714
he had to curse
and disrespect me?

38:45.714 --> 38:49.327
Girl, the man was
so disrespectful to me.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.545
Are you kidding?
- You were, too,

38:50.545 --> 38:51.938
and y'all were--
y'all ambushed the man!

38:51.938 --> 38:53.243
You can't--
you can't do that, Sheree.

38:53.243 --> 38:55.071
Sheree, don't do that.
- No, you don't do that.

38:55.071 --> 38:56.334
Listen. These are
the things that are--

38:56.334 --> 38:57.813
It's bros before hos.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.380
- No, hos before bros. Hold on.
- No, bros before--

38:59.380 --> 39:00.642
We bros.
- Right. Oh, we bros. Oh.

39:00.642 --> 39:03.123
In this case, we're bros.
He's the ho.

39:03.123 --> 39:04.472
Okay.

39:04.472 --> 39:05.778
Okay, listen.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.780
No, but we gotta watch--
we gotta be careful

39:07.780 --> 39:08.998
with our words because--
- Sheree...

39:08.998 --> 39:10.522
He's hearing all
the-these people--

39:10.522 --> 39:11.827
it wasn't just you--
saying he deleted--

39:11.827 --> 39:13.002
I was disrespectful
to him.

39:13.002 --> 39:15.483
- What?!
- Until he started cursing.

39:15.483 --> 39:18.834
Don't entertain that.

39:18.834 --> 39:21.663
I'm appalled at how
Kenya treated Martell.

39:21.663 --> 39:24.100
She should be taking
responsibility for her actions,

39:24.100 --> 39:26.015
but yet she's trying
to defend herself.

39:26.015 --> 39:27.669
Yeah, she's mad
'cause she got caught.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.628
So, now you're
gonna attack him

39:29.628 --> 39:31.543
and say that
he's attacking you?

39:31.543 --> 39:33.022
That's not
how it works.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.894
Him saying, "Oh,
I don't care if I you,"

39:34.894 --> 39:36.635
that's not
offensive to me.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.463
That's him
in the way he talk.

39:38.463 --> 39:41.509
What got me was, I said,
"Oh, I don't know.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.076
I get a lotta DMs."

39:43.076 --> 39:46.558
And he said," Yeah, and I bet
you answer 'em all, too,"

39:46.558 --> 39:48.473
somethin' like that.
- I didn't hear that.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.039
Go in her messages,
right now, and see,

39:50.039 --> 39:51.693
I bet she probably accepted
everybody's messages.

39:51.693 --> 39:53.608
Go to it, right now, and see.
- Wait, who? Who?

39:55.958 --> 39:58.700
He's trying to say I'm a ho,
or I'm-- yes, he did.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.789
Yeah. Yes, he did.
- Oh, my God!

40:00.789 --> 40:02.487
- Yes, he did. No, Sheree.
- Kenya, are you serious?

40:02.487 --> 40:03.836
Sheree, he was like,
"Yeah, and I bet

40:03.836 --> 40:05.315
you answer 'em all, too."

40:05.315 --> 40:07.448
There is no way that
I would have that reaction

40:07.448 --> 40:08.971
if somebody said--
- That's you.

40:08.971 --> 40:10.495
"I bet you check
all your DMs."

40:10.495 --> 40:11.583
No, it was the way.

40:11.583 --> 40:12.627
Uh, it wouldn't
trigger me at all.

40:12.627 --> 40:14.586
I'd be like,
"They wish."

40:14.586 --> 40:17.545
You're trying to make
somethin' out of nothing

40:17.545 --> 40:18.851
'cause it-it never
went anywhere.

40:18.851 --> 40:20.461
But you can
hold him accountable

40:20.461 --> 40:22.898
for how he acted
toward me.

40:22.898 --> 40:25.379
A man should never speak
to a woman in that way,

40:25.379 --> 40:27.294
whether he's angry
or not, ever.

40:27.294 --> 40:28.774
It's unacceptable.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.166
So, is it okay for you
to get in his face, though?

40:30.166 --> 40:31.429
I'm just asking.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.908
It's okay
if I'm defending myself. Yes.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.301
So, when
he's defending himself,

40:34.301 --> 40:35.389
it's not okay
to-to speak.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.564
It's okay
to defend himself,

40:36.564 --> 40:39.741
but he does not ever
have to be abusive.

40:39.741 --> 40:42.918
Okay, Kenya, first,
Ross was aggressive

40:42.918 --> 40:44.311
because he
defended Sanya.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.747
Now, Martell
defends himself,

40:45.747 --> 40:47.314
and you call him
a piece of sh--.

40:47.314 --> 40:49.838
What is your issue with calling
Black men aggressive?

40:49.838 --> 40:51.623
Are they public enemy
number one

40:51.623 --> 40:54.103
because you don't
have one?

40:54.103 --> 40:56.628
You gotta look at your past
and the things

40:56.628 --> 40:58.412
that you have accepted
from men.

40:58.412 --> 41:01.546
And when Bob was saying crazy
sh-- about you in the car,

41:01.546 --> 41:03.939
you have not learned
that's a sign.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.942
There is never a scenario
where it's okay

41:06.942 --> 41:08.596
for a man to speak
to a woman like that.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.250
And there's never
a scenario when--

41:10.250 --> 41:12.034
where it's okay
for a woman to speak--

41:12.034 --> 41:13.558
You gotta-- you gotta
acknowledge that.

41:13.558 --> 41:15.516
Abuse is abuse, though,
but you have to see the signs,

41:15.516 --> 41:16.865
and that is what I've learned.
- No, we gotta-we-- you gotta

41:16.865 --> 41:18.476
stop trying to label

41:18.476 --> 41:19.694
these Black men
and Black women--

41:19.694 --> 41:21.000
Sheree, don't turn
this around on me.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.610
Kenya, no, I'm not
turning it around on you,

41:22.610 --> 41:23.785
but do not do that, though.
- Don't turn it around on me.

41:23.785 --> 41:26.048
I felt like I was
standing up for myself

41:26.048 --> 41:27.789
because everybody else
was there with a man,

41:27.789 --> 41:28.616
and here we go,

41:28.616 --> 41:30.096
I'm out here by myself,

41:30.096 --> 41:31.967
and some man
is talking to me crazy.

41:31.967 --> 41:34.317
Everyone is not mad--
everybody is not him.

41:34.317 --> 41:36.711
Kenya, what would you need
to get past this?

41:36.711 --> 41:38.931
Ooh, Sheree, Sheree,

41:38.931 --> 41:40.759
we're gonna have to
agree to disagree.

41:43.065 --> 41:46.286
Next time, on "The Real
Housewives of Atlanta"...

41:46.286 --> 41:50.333
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Ahh!
No, my nails. Ahh!

41:50.333 --> 41:52.988
Kick your legs, so you don't
run into the wall. Jesus!

41:52.988 --> 41:54.990
Bravo Con-- I thought
that it was a weekend

41:54.990 --> 41:56.426
of, like, celebrating.
- Yeah.

41:56.426 --> 41:58.646
But every time
we got on stage,

41:58.646 --> 42:00.822
the bullsh-- happened.
- Something.

42:00.822 --> 42:03.651
If I could replace Todd,
I probably would've picked

42:03.651 --> 42:07.307
anyone that had
a decent job.

42:07.307 --> 42:10.397
I just need her to
respect my marriage.

42:10.397 --> 42:11.398
Please.

42:17.404 --> 42:20.102
Are you serious?

42:23.062 --> 42:25.020
I wanna bring
out a special guest.

42:25.020 --> 42:28.981
If I can do this tonight,
I am on my way to my dreams.

42:28.981 --> 42:31.026
Miss Drew Sidora.

42:33.725 --> 42:35.857
You said that
she went to some event,

42:35.857 --> 42:37.163
and she brought
the hood out.

42:37.163 --> 42:38.686
- The thing that triggers me--
- Calm down--

42:38.686 --> 42:40.383
Is that
you don't know me,

42:40.383 --> 42:42.037
and that you're saying--
- I-- and I definitely--

42:42.037 --> 42:43.735
- "Oh, she bring the hood out."
- And I promise--

42:43.735 --> 42:44.953
- Bottom line--
- That I'm okay not knowing you!

42:44.953 --> 42:46.215
I bring everybody out!

42:47.956 --> 42:49.915
- My blood nephew is dead.
- But I said--

42:49.915 --> 42:52.700
- My blood nephew is dead--
- I feel-- I feel--

42:52.700 --> 42:54.093
and you're talking
about acting.

42:54.093 --> 42:55.398
No, you're acting, though.
- But if-- I feel--

42:55.398 --> 42:56.574
you!

42:56.574 --> 42:58.271
My nephew is dead,
bitch!
