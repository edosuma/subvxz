Yeah, yeah, Tina, Hi!

01:28.388 --> 01:29.623
Yeah. No, Balki’s
not here right now.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.124
Can I take your number?

01:32.358 --> 01:33.694
Uh‐huh.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.261
Okay, well,
you know, I really have

01:35.295 --> 01:39.232
no idea
if he is free on Tuesday.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.467
Oh, your second date!

01:41.502 --> 01:45.205
Well, you are a lucky,

Uh‐huh.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.176
Okay, bye‐bye.

Larry, dating
all these women at once is

01:54.781 --> 01:58.218
is sending Balki down a‐a
terrible and‐and lonely road.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.587
I‐I think that deep down,
he’s miserable.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.590
Okay, you lost me.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.628
Balki has had twenty dates

02:08.662 --> 02:09.930
in the last two weeks.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.765
You call that misery?

Balki is trying to fill
the void left by Mary Anne.

He’s never gonna be happy
until they get back together.

Alright, alright, uh‐Jen,
I‐I‐I know that

02:22.275 --> 02:24.645

very much for driving.

in for a nightcap?

02:43.229 --> 02:44.264
Well, I would but I don’t think

02:44.297 --> 02:45.932

would fit you.

evening we had.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.015
We went to a magic show

03:35.048 --> 03:37.450
and, uh, she was picked out
of the audience

03:37.483 --> 03:38.819
to be a contestant.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.321
They put her in a box

where she is.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.979
Alright, maybe "Happy"
isn’t exactly the right word.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.448
Larry, you have to go
talk to him.

04:42.482 --> 04:43.784
He’s feeling empty

04:43.817 --> 04:46.352
and‐a‐and shallow
and he’s quoting song lyrics

04:46.386 --> 04:48.421

04:48.454 --> 04:49.756
Alright, alight,
I’ll talk to him

04:49.790 --> 04:51.357
but this has nothing
to do with Mary Anne.

04:51.391 --> 04:52.793
‐Yes, it does.
‐N‐no, he just...

04:52.826 --> 04:55.629
He just needs
to slow down his dating habits.

04:55.662 --> 04:56.930
He’s confused
because he’s dating

04:56.963 --> 04:58.799
too many women at a time.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.067
I experienced the same thing
when I was in college.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.472
Well, I read about the same
thing when I was in college.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.775
An‐an‐anyway,
I will straighten him out.

Now let me,
l‐let me get this straight.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.557
You’re...you’re dating

05:23.590 --> 05:26.627
all these gorgeous women

05:26.660 --> 05:28.629

05:28.662 --> 05:30.831
Yeah.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.065
You’re not happy?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.602
I‐I know that you told me

05:35.636 --> 05:37.671
the American bachelor’s dream

05:37.704 --> 05:40.106
was to juggle
three women at the same time...

I‐I‐I’m gonna give you
a‐a slight adjustment

05:56.489 --> 05:59.159
to some of the advice
I gave you earlier.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.562
Well, cousin,
your exact words were

06:01.595 --> 06:05.031
"Balki, you got to date
until your head caves in

06:05.065 --> 06:07.601
"and then remember
every little detail

06:07.634 --> 06:09.636
so you can tell me
about it later."

06:11.838 --> 06:14.675
Balki, I‐I think
you gotta slow down.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.844
You know, get to know
the women that you date.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.913
You know,
find out who they are

06:19.946 --> 06:22.048
w‐w‐what they’re like.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.918
Learn to listen to their

06:24.951 --> 06:26.887
inane little stories.

’I talked to Balki, he’s happy.

loves Mary Anne

06:41.768 --> 06:44.004
and Mary Anne still loves him.

he’s over Mary Anne.

to dinner tonight to celebrate!

‐Really?
‐Well, Balki.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.665
Congratulations!
Where’d you meet her?

07:11.698 --> 07:14.535
On the carousel in the park,
about an hour ago.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.604
I‐I think she was swayed
by the fact that

07:17.638 --> 07:19.873
uh, my shirt
wasn’t tucked into my underwear.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.210
Balki, before you decide
she’s the girl for you

07:24.244 --> 07:26.613
don’t you think you should spend
a little more time with her?

07:26.647 --> 07:29.616
Oh, sometimes,
you know, love just

07:29.650 --> 07:33.086
hits you in the stomach
and makes you nauseous.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.056
And this girl...makes me sick.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.595
She’s in the kitchen right now,
I’d like to bring her out

07:41.628 --> 07:43.229
and introduce you to her.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.070
Well, there goes one happy man!

07:50.103 --> 07:51.838
He’s met a girl

07:51.872 --> 07:53.206
he’s moving on with his life

07:53.239 --> 07:55.709
and he owes it all to me.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.811
I don’t buy it, Larry.
He still loves Mary Anne.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.647
Oh, Jen‐Jennifer,
I know how you feel

08:00.681 --> 08:04.284
but Mary Anne
is in his deep past.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.252
He is over Mary Anne
for good.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.270

08:24.304 --> 08:26.573

08:30.210 --> 08:32.546
Is she one of a kind or what?

08:33.980 --> 08:36.883
Balki, you said
that before dinner

08:36.917 --> 08:39.820
we could race our jackets
down the laundry chute.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.523
Last one up the stairs
is a rotten eggbeater!

08:46.860 --> 08:48.695
And we owe this all to you!

09:06.813 --> 09:09.883

gonna like this restaurant.

09:09.916 --> 09:12.753
The food is excellent,
the service is great

09:12.786 --> 09:14.888
and the bread sticks
are just small enough

09:14.921 --> 09:16.557
to stick up your nose.

09:18.625 --> 09:19.760

for the last time I admit

I was wrong about Balki.

Larry, it doesn’t matter
who’s right or wrong.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.722
What’s important
is what we do about it.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.156
Got any ideas?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.058
Not a one.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.094
But I did just save us
a buck on parking!

alright, don’t panic.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.800
Uh, Balki, uh

10:33.834 --> 10:35.669

10:35.702 --> 10:37.804

Ah! Well, of course.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.013

How long is the wait?

10:49.950 --> 10:51.384

10:54.120 --> 10:55.989
Hi, Mary Anne.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.729
Um...how are you?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.097
Fine.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.801
‐You look great.
‐Thank you, you look great too!

11:07.834 --> 11:10.136
You look just great.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.338
‐Are you happy?
‐Yeah, I’m happy!

11:12.372 --> 11:15.308
‐Are you happy?
‐Oh, couldn’t be happier!

11:15.341 --> 11:17.177
Well, I’m happy
to hear you’re happy.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.745
Honey, this is happy.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.113
I mean, this is, uh...

11:20.146 --> 11:22.048
’This is, this is Mary Anne.’

11:22.082 --> 11:24.450
And Mary Anne, this is Honey.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.086
It’s nice to meet you, Honey.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.789
It’s very nice to meet you, too.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.290
I love your hair.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.794
I could never get mine
to do that.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.031
Mary Anne,
would you like to join us?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.968
Okay, but,
but I’m here with my date.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.106
Oh, you‐you are?
Well, that’s great.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.208
Yeah, I think
you’d really like him.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.876
Well, sure.
Well, he can join us, too.

11:49.910 --> 11:50.911
Where is he?

12:02.188 --> 12:03.757
Oh, there he is.

Yoo‐hoo, over here.

He’s pretty special.

Oh, go on with you.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.470
I’m happy to make
your acquaintance.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.741
What did he just say?

He said he’s happy
to make your acquaintance.

Oh, pleased to meet you.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.753
Larry, what are we going to do?

12:33.987 --> 12:35.989
I don’t know.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.224
But maybe two people
who look exactly like us

12:38.258 --> 12:40.193
will come in
and explain it to us.

12:43.129 --> 12:46.066
[instrumental music]

12:52.606 --> 12:54.307
Mary Anne and Balki are dating

and they don’t even see it.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.479

12:59.513 --> 13:01.915
Well, I can’t believe
there’s no cheesecake.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.349
Larry!

13:03.383 --> 13:05.051
Alright, alright, alright, look.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.820
We’ll‐we’ll just
go back to the table

13:06.853 --> 13:10.056
sit down,
drop a few subtle hints

13:10.090 --> 13:11.825
and get them to see
what’s going on.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.363
So anyway to this day

13:17.397 --> 13:18.832
the moose doesn’t know

13:18.865 --> 13:21.167
what happened to his shower cap.

13:21.201 --> 13:24.137
[laughing]

13:25.939 --> 13:27.140
[sighing]

13:30.977 --> 13:33.113
I don’t get it.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.281
Neither do I.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.184
Oh,
but I love your accent, Nico.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.253
Are you from Mypos, too?

13:40.286 --> 13:42.488
No, I’m from Greece.

13:42.523 --> 13:44.625
Why does everyone think
I’m from Mypos?

13:44.658 --> 13:46.226
With that nose?

13:49.262 --> 13:52.365
Uh, Nico, your,
your vest is very beautiful.

13:52.398 --> 13:56.102
I‐I know I’ve seen one
very similar to it before.

13:56.136 --> 14:00.340
Mary Anne, does this vest
look familiar to you?

14:02.909 --> 14:05.546
You know you’re right!

14:05.579 --> 14:08.649
I don’t believe
I didn’t see this sooner!

14:08.682 --> 14:11.451
We used to have a couch
made out of that same material.

14:14.588 --> 14:15.922
‐Balki?
‐Mm‐hmm.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.591
Would you like some pepper?

14:17.624 --> 14:20.393
Pepper!
Oh, Balki never uses pepper.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.428
It makes his feet itch.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.299
You remembered.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.206
Is it just me...

14:36.142 --> 14:39.279
...or is there
an amazing similarity

14:39.312 --> 14:41.347
between the four of you?

14:41.381 --> 14:44.450
Well, of course there is.
Don’t be ridiculous!

14:44.484 --> 14:47.320
‐Finally!
‐We all ordered rice.

14:50.524 --> 14:52.258
‐Okay, Balki.
‐’Mm?’

14:52.292 --> 14:53.660
Come with me
to the dessert cart.

14:53.694 --> 14:56.062
No, cousin, I’ve got
a knife full of peas here

14:56.096 --> 14:57.130
and they’re all just nice

14:57.163 --> 14:59.099
and peppered
at room temperature...

14:59.132 --> 15:00.300
Yeah, very nice.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.434
This is a lovely meal, you know

15:01.467 --> 15:03.003
and, oh, my goodness!

15:05.539 --> 15:06.940
Cousin, cousin!

15:11.011 --> 15:12.478
You’re embarrassing me!

15:15.215 --> 15:16.650
Don’t you see
what’s going on here?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.952
‐You mean about Mary Anne?
‐Yes!

15:18.985 --> 15:20.486
I can’t believe you
brought that up.

15:20.521 --> 15:22.322
I thought
I was the only one that saw it.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.457
Nico is all wrong for her.

15:24.490 --> 15:25.726
I mean, the‐the, he’s just

15:25.759 --> 15:28.128
he’s got a silly accent...

15:30.130 --> 15:33.399
...he smells of goat cheese
and those clothes!

15:33.433 --> 15:36.236
Those clothes! Stop it!
Take him shopping!

15:39.372 --> 15:43.009
Plus he’s got
the attention span of a child.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.745
’Oh, they’re balancing
spoons on their noses.’

15:44.778 --> 15:46.412
I want in on this.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.587
[piano music]

15:55.589 --> 15:57.991
Wrong seat! Wrong seat! Um...

15:58.024 --> 16:00.493
Can I, would it be alright
if I, if I, I’m sorry.

16:00.527 --> 16:01.595
‐I didn’t mean to‐‐
‐You know, that’s alright.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.330
It’s alright. Alright. Go ahead.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.732
‐No, go ahead.
‐Thank you very much, cousin.

16:05.766 --> 16:08.702
[chattering]

16:15.075 --> 16:18.011
[instrumental music]

16:19.780 --> 16:23.349
Balki, would you
come down here, please?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.485
We have to talk!

16:25.519 --> 16:28.188
You know, I was sure
they would catch on last night

16:28.221 --> 16:30.190
wh‐when people in the restaurant
kept on coming up

16:30.223 --> 16:32.626
and asking them if they were
the Doublemint twins.

16:35.061 --> 16:37.030
Well, they,
they didn’t catch on, Larry

16:37.063 --> 16:38.331
and that’s why
it’s up to you and me to just

16:38.364 --> 16:41.134
point them
in the right direction.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.737
Is this gonna take long?
Because I have plans.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.773
Uh, Honey and I are going
to the museum today.

16:46.807 --> 16:48.509
This is the day
they wax the floors.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.611
It’s perfect
for skating in your socks.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.614
Balki, have a seat.

16:56.783 --> 17:00.386
Uh, Jennifer and I wanted
to ask you about something.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.756
Uh, uh,
how do you feel about Honey?

17:02.789 --> 17:05.157
I adore honey on a muffin.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.161
In tea, I have to go
with granulated sugar.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.767
I mean Honey, the girl.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.435
Honey LeBelwich!

17:15.468 --> 17:19.305
Oh, she’s terrific.
She’s, you know, so, so sweet.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.306
Innocent.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.810
Naive yet with
an occasional spark of genius.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.649
So...you like her?

17:28.682 --> 17:31.618
Oh, no one compares
to Mary Anne.

17:31.652 --> 17:34.588
Ah‐ha! What did you just say?

17:34.621 --> 17:36.823
She‐she‐she just said,
"So, you like her?"

17:36.857 --> 17:39.425
and I said,
"No one compares to Honey."

17:39.459 --> 17:41.728
No, you said Mary Anne,
not Honey.

17:41.762 --> 17:43.530
You said,
"No one compares to Mary Anne."

17:43.564 --> 17:46.366
‐No, I didn’t.
‐I heard it, too.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.734
What? What is it with you two?

17:47.768 --> 17:49.770
I know my own voice.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.472
Hello?

17:55.241 --> 17:57.443
[knocking on door]

18:01.815 --> 18:05.719
Hi, Mary Anne!
Look, everyone, it’s Mary Anne!

18:05.752 --> 18:07.588
‐Hi, Mary Anne.
‐Hi, Balki.

18:07.621 --> 18:08.689
How are you?

18:11.357 --> 18:12.726
Is this gonna take long?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.561
They wax the floors
at the museum today.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.666
Before you say anything
to these two

18:19.700 --> 18:21.502
I just want you to know

18:21.535 --> 18:22.603
the lights are on

18:22.636 --> 18:24.705
but they don’t own homes.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.375
If you get what I mean, okay.

18:31.612 --> 18:33.614
Mary Anne,
I‐I’m glad you’re here.

18:33.647 --> 18:35.415
Jennifer and I thought that, uh

18:35.448 --> 18:38.418
we should all
get together and, uh, chat.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.555
You know, about, uh,
current events, the weather...

18:42.756 --> 18:44.290
...displacement of true feelings

18:44.324 --> 18:45.826
for one person onto another

18:45.859 --> 18:48.662
having similar, almost
identical characteristics.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.834
You know...stuff!

18:59.472 --> 19:00.941
Need I say more?

19:00.974 --> 19:02.375
[whistling]

19:03.844 --> 19:05.512
Mary Anne, have you noticed

19:05.546 --> 19:07.614
that you and Balki are dating

19:07.648 --> 19:09.850
people who look
exactly like you?

19:11.818 --> 19:14.487
Well, I don’t think
I look anything like Nico!

19:18.959 --> 19:20.293
Our mistake, our mistake.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.895
No, I‐I‐I think what

19:21.928 --> 19:24.430
what Jennifer means is‐is‐is

19:24.464 --> 19:27.568
it’s just that, you know,
after meeting Nico and Honey

19:27.601 --> 19:31.237
[chuckling]
it seems that both of you
are attracted

19:31.271 --> 19:35.776
to people who‐who seem
to resemble one another.

19:35.809 --> 19:37.778
And don’t you find that odd?

19:40.814 --> 19:43.449
When you say "Odd..."

19:46.486 --> 19:49.990
...do you mean odd funny

19:50.023 --> 19:52.492
or odd weird?

19:53.894 --> 19:55.662
Weird.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.397
When you say "Attracted"

19:57.430 --> 19:59.733
do you mean attracted allured

19:59.766 --> 20:03.269
or attracted a force acting
between particles of matter

20:03.303 --> 20:05.872
tending to draw them together
and resisting their separation?

20:08.408 --> 20:09.843
Allured.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.314
‐What was the question?
‐What was the question?

20:14.347 --> 20:16.282
Oh, God!

20:16.316 --> 20:17.918
‐Conference.
‐Okay, alright.

20:17.951 --> 20:19.620
Okay, alright, uh,
y‐y‐you know something

20:19.653 --> 20:20.754
we’ll be right back.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.422
Wh‐why don’t you just, uh

20:22.455 --> 20:23.990
chat amongst yourselves?

20:33.700 --> 20:36.803
Well, I’m sure glad
you met someone that you like.

20:36.837 --> 20:38.939
I did? Who?

20:38.972 --> 20:41.474
‐Nico.
‐Oh, Nico, right.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.409
Yeah.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.411
And you and Honey
make a lovely couple.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.748
Oh, thank you,
thank you very much.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.554
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
you wanna laugh?

20:53.587 --> 20:55.789
[laughing]

20:55.822 --> 20:57.691
Can you believe that at one time

20:57.724 --> 20:59.459
you and I were thinking
of getting married?

20:59.492 --> 21:01.427
[laughing]

21:02.929 --> 21:05.732
Oh, boy, that seems
like a thousand years ago!

21:05.766 --> 21:08.068
Does it ever! Oh...

21:08.101 --> 21:10.036
[both sighing]

21:23.817 --> 21:25.752
Well, we’ve gone
with the subtle approach

21:25.786 --> 21:27.353
and the not‐so‐subtle approach.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.455
Do you have any other ideas?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.057
We could wrap them
together with duct tape

21:31.091 --> 21:33.727
until they come to their senses.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.962
Larry, I’m serious.

21:35.996 --> 21:37.397
We have to go back in there

21:37.430 --> 21:38.732
tell them they’re perfect
for each other

21:38.765 --> 21:41.835
and force them
to get back together again.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.470
If that doesn’t work
we’ll go with the duct tape.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.908
Okay, you two. Listen up.

21:47.941 --> 21:50.410
You... Oh!

21:50.443 --> 21:52.979
Well, I guess
they did get it on their own.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.784
Well, now this I like!

21:57.818 --> 22:00.921
Now this is a good first step.

22:02.523 --> 22:05.659
Alright, now you two kids
get reacquainted.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.060
You know, take it slow.

22:08.128 --> 22:10.463
Spend some time together.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.898
And who knows?

22:11.932 --> 22:14.367
You might even have
a future together.

22:15.969 --> 22:17.904
Mary Anne and I
are getting married.

22:18.872 --> 22:20.607
[instrumental music]

22:32.519 --> 22:34.821
[theme music]

23:02.849 --> 23:04.651
[music continues]
