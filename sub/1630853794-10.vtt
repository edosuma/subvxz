WEBVTT

00:19.602 --> 00:21.354
[Harley] Previously on
Harley Quinn...

00:21.938 --> 00:28.194
Fu...

00:28.278 --> 00:29.279
[Harley] And now...

00:30.864 --> 00:33.950
...uck!

00:34.033 --> 00:37.036
[groans] Damn it, Harley!
What the hell?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.663
I, I'm so sorry.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.206
I mean, the whole thing
with the zombies
and the barfin'

00:40.290 --> 00:41.166
and the mass murder--

00:41.249 --> 00:43.209
I was building Edin.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.462
It's something I thought
you wanted, too.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.965
It felt incredible
and you made me stop.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.091
Why?

00:52.010 --> 00:53.136
[sighs]

00:53.219 --> 00:54.763
Well, you should
figure that the fuck out.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.347
Deuces.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.808
Wait. Ive!
Please don't be mad.
Where are you going?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.144
Somewhere I can relax
and think.

01:01.227 --> 01:04.189
Oh, if that means you're going
to Mor-4-Lex, we're out
of toilet paper.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.648
-Fine.
-And make sure you get three--

01:05.732 --> 01:08.067
Three ply. I know.
You've got a bougie butt.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.988
[theme music playing]

01:13.948 --> 01:15.784
[people cheering]

01:15.867 --> 01:19.162
No, oh, no, no, no.
Please don't. Do not thank me.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.371
[cheering continues]

01:20.455 --> 01:21.915
[woman] Thank you,
Harley Quinn!

01:21.998 --> 01:23.249
-[man] Harley, thank you!
-You saved us from Ivy!

01:23.333 --> 01:24.918
No, please.
Oh, God, no. Don't--

01:25.001 --> 01:26.002
-Thank you, Harley.
You saved us.
-[baby coos]

01:26.085 --> 01:27.670
No, no... please. No.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.339
Uh, can we get some applause?

01:29.422 --> 01:32.884
Because there is a hero
in the house.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.094
-Please shut up.
-Why? It's true.

01:35.178 --> 01:40.141
You basically
sacrificed yourself
to stop Ivy and save humanity.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.602
Why did I do that?
I don't want to stop Ivy.

01:42.685 --> 01:44.020
I want to support her.

01:44.103 --> 01:45.313
But I also don't want everyone
in Gotham to die.

01:45.396 --> 01:48.399
Ooh. Sounds like
you need to talk.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.194
Want to crush some canned cider
and unpack all this?

01:51.277 --> 01:52.695
There's nothing to unpack.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.532
Hey, so, I'm gonna need
a Batman to sign for this.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.534
Oh, a man?

01:57.617 --> 02:00.161
So a Batgirl
couldn't be competent enough--

02:00.245 --> 02:02.705
His name is on
the registration.

02:02.789 --> 02:03.748
-[Batgirl] Yerp.
-Yeesh.

02:10.129 --> 02:11.339
I gotta say,

02:11.422 --> 02:13.550
I like this new swagger on you.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.969
You've got a certain
je ne sais quoi.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.470
Now, I'll put money on it.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.305
In the next 24 hours,

02:19.389 --> 02:23.059
no less than three people
are going to randomly
compliment you.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.894
You're looking that good.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.689
Well, I'm not feeling
that good. [sighs]

02:27.772 --> 02:30.900
I mean,
things are weird with Harley,
and my plan failed.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.111
-Again.
-You're looking at this
all wrong.

02:33.194 --> 02:36.865
Ruining Jazzapajizza is some
hard core supervillain shit.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.826
Fuck you, Ivy!

02:39.909 --> 02:42.579
Whoa!
You were tapped into The Green.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.707
No one could stop you.
You had to stop yourself.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.584
Now, that's real power.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.753
When a villain got to stop
her own villainoire self!

02:50.837 --> 02:54.757
I mean, it was pretty [blows]
pretty bad ass, I guess.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.676
[man over tv] A Hard Wayne's
Gonna Fall.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.970
-Directed by James Gunn.
In theaters--
-[tv flickers]

02:59.053 --> 03:01.931
-[screams]
-Apologies
for the abrupt pop in.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.726
-Ivy, did you change your hair?
-That's one.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.477
I saw what you did
at Jazzapajiz--

03:06.561 --> 03:08.271
-Yeah, I'm not saying that.
-[coughs]

03:08.354 --> 03:11.357
Suffice it to say, the scale
of potential devastation

03:11.441 --> 03:14.944
was enough to make even me
soil my boxer briefs.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.821
And you don't shit your pants
for anything.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.114
That is correct.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.991
Well, was.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.826
Yeah, thanks.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.412
Now, if you'll excuse me,
they're putting out
scallion pancake samples.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.331
[grunts] Huh?

03:26.414 --> 03:27.957
I'll cut to the chase.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.502
I'm looking to rebuild
the Legion of Doom in Gotham.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.088
[Poison Ivy] Hey, Lex.
How many times are we
going to do this, bud?

03:34.172 --> 03:36.007
'Cause I don't want to be
in the Legion of Doom.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.551
I know. I want you to run it.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.469
-I'm sorry, what?
-[gasps]

03:39.552 --> 03:41.638
You're a threat.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.807
And, frankly, I trust
the threat I pay more
than the threat I don't.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.852
Well, I'm not interested
in being some puppet figurehead

03:47.936 --> 03:49.771
for your corporate tax shelter.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.315
Plus, you'd never agree
to my terms.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.067
Try me.

03:54.150 --> 03:57.695
Well, first off,
I'd need to be paid
an obscene amount of money.

03:57.779 --> 03:58.738
Of course.

03:58.821 --> 03:59.989
Get that paper.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.866
-Hey, I really missed you.
-I know.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.452
And I'd uh, I'd need
to be in complete control.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.496
So I run things.

04:06.579 --> 04:11.459
I get to do whatever I want
without needing approval
from anyone, including you.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.295
The Legion of Doom
will be yours.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.255
Think about it, Ivy.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.675
You got so close
to permanently changing Gotham,

04:18.758 --> 04:22.512
and all you had was a tiny lab
and some test tubes.

04:22.595 --> 04:26.683
Imagine what you could do
with my vast resources
at your disposal.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.060
You'd be unstoppable.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.605
I don't want
to have to babysit Bane.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.108
We'll move him
to our Tempe office.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.067
Well, shit.

04:38.361 --> 04:42.240
So, are you done reburying
my dead zombie parents, Alfred?

04:42.323 --> 04:43.700
Indeed, Sir. Ooh.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.953
Perhaps I went
a little overboard.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.372
I'd venture
to say you did, Sir.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.874
My loneliness and despair
got the best of me.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.711
The edges of reality started
to blur for a minute there.

04:54.794 --> 04:58.381
I think it's time I take off
my obsidian-colored glasses.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.217
Stop letting the specter
of my dead parents haunt me.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.268
[engine roaring]

05:10.351 --> 05:13.354
Of course everywhere I turn,
I'm reminded of this movie.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.732
Well, I hesitate
to bring this up, sir,

05:15.815 --> 05:19.485
but the producer sent tickets
to the premiere tomorrow.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.821
-I'll return them at once.
-Hold up, hold up.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.991
If I want to stop being
tortured by this movie,

05:25.074 --> 05:27.535
I should confront my demons
head on at the premiere.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.245
No worries.

05:29.328 --> 05:31.664
I shall clean up at once
to accompany you
through this trying--

05:31.748 --> 05:33.791
Oh, sorry. [chuckles]

05:33.875 --> 05:35.877
I've already asked
someone else, so.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.421
[clears throat] Anyway. [yawns]

05:38.504 --> 05:42.050
Yeah, I'm probably
gonna get dressed.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.217
I... I'll do it myself.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.219
[groans]

05:50.767 --> 05:53.936
[groans] Why am I ugly
in everything?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.772
[sobs] I'm so-- Forgive me.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.108
It appears my nerves are tender
on this premiere's eve.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.276
Well, calm down.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.236
You're just having
a diva moment.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.948
But the cool thing is,
this premiere is all about
BBT's big day.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.533
So the pressure's off of you.
[chuckles]

06:07.617 --> 06:10.119
No one, not a single soul
will know it was you

06:10.203 --> 06:12.914
acting like Billy Bob
acting like Thomas Wayne.
[laughs]

06:12.997 --> 06:14.582
No one will know?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.793
[cats meow]

06:16.876 --> 06:18.628
Ooh, did you just get a facial?

06:18.711 --> 06:20.046
Uh, that's two.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.966
Hey, Harley.
We need to, uh, we gotta talk.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.968
I know, Ive.
I am still so sorry.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.470
Me first, me first. So.

06:27.553 --> 06:31.307
Lex Luthor wants me
to run the new Legion of Doom.

06:31.390 --> 06:34.435
Ha! I wish
I could have been there
when you told him to fuck off.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.979
Uh, you couldn't,
because I didn't.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.272
Um, what?

06:38.356 --> 06:40.399
It's a great opportunity
for me, creatively.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.985
Totally! Yeah, no.
Who cares that he's
an amoral piece of shit.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.488
I mean, you are doing
the dang thing,

06:45.571 --> 06:48.199
looking all good
in the neighborhood.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.868
-[cat meows]
-It's all right.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.703
I, I didn't expect you
to be okay with me doing it.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.998
What? Are you kidding me?
I am so okay with you doing it.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.793
So okay that we're doing it.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.420
I... I don't,
I don't know, Harls. I...

07:01.504 --> 07:03.506
Look, okay.
I know I took a dump
on your passion project,

07:03.589 --> 07:06.300
but it won't happen again.
Please, please let me prove it.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.804
-I... I just-- I'm not sure
we're on the same page.
-Listen.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.516
I am down to do
whatever you need me to do
to make your dreams come true.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.352
No questions asked.
I am your ride or die.

07:16.435 --> 07:17.687
Are you sure?

07:17.770 --> 07:19.188
Because in order
to close with Lex,

07:19.272 --> 07:21.566
I'm killing the Mayor
at the premiere tomorrow.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.567
Totally. Wait.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.402
Like Joker, the Mayor?

07:24.485 --> 07:27.822
Yeah, I mean, Lex has beef
with his new evil lair tax.
[sighs]

07:27.905 --> 07:29.615
Is that gonna be
a problem or...?

07:29.699 --> 07:33.536
Ha, let's kill
the fucking joker.
Oh! I love that for us.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.662
Whoo!

07:36.122 --> 07:37.415
-Oh, okay.
-Shit.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.250
No, honey, you know what?

07:39.333 --> 07:41.544
That's okay. There's, like,
an entire palette
of champagne in the car.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.463
-Sadly, no. I simply cannot
shake the feeling
-[tires screech]

07:44.547 --> 07:46.465
that after all the work
I've put in,

07:46.549 --> 07:50.386
in the end,
all the spoils will go
to one William Robert Thornton.

07:50.469 --> 07:52.555
But isn't that
every actor's dream?

07:52.638 --> 07:55.641
To disappear into a role
so no one knows it's you?

07:55.725 --> 08:00.438
I will let you in on a secret
not many outside
of the acting world know.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.398
All thespians are vain.

08:02.481 --> 08:03.357
[gasps] What?

08:04.233 --> 08:05.401
To a wild night.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.071
[burps loudly]

08:11.574 --> 08:12.408
[sneezes]

08:13.075 --> 08:14.035
Goddamn it!

08:16.454 --> 08:17.622
It's show time.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.208
[screaming, cheering]

08:23.127 --> 08:24.420
[indistinct shouting]

08:24.503 --> 08:25.463
[male reporter] How's Angelina?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.760
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

08:30.843 --> 08:32.094
-[footsteps approaching]
-[sighs]

08:32.178 --> 08:33.012
Huh?

08:34.055 --> 08:35.973
Selina? You're looking, uh...

08:36.057 --> 08:38.059
stunning.
I'm surprised you came.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.143
Ditto.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.394
How are you?

08:40.478 --> 08:42.063
Oh, fantastic.

08:42.146 --> 08:45.524
Zero zombie-related drama
on my end, that's,
that's for sure.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.318
Happy to hear it.

08:47.401 --> 08:50.947
I assumed this entire event
would be triggering,
to say the least.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.282
Wait, are you here
to support me?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.535
Even though we're not dating
and I find you sad,

08:56.619 --> 08:59.038
it doesn't mean
I don't want to see you happy.

09:00.706 --> 09:01.874
Ex... excuse me.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.335
Probably an appetizer
got in my eye.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.301
[laughs]

09:12.385 --> 09:14.637
Great tie, Clock King.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.849
Nora and Swamp Thing are
an item. I love that.

09:18.933 --> 09:22.311
Cheryl, I see you
double fisting.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.397
[laughs] Like Joker do.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.774
[laughs] Oh, yes.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.443
Apparently,
I'm sitting at ZZZ69.

09:29.527 --> 09:33.739
which, if I'm keeping it 100,
doesn't sound like
a mayoral place to sit.

09:34.824 --> 09:35.741
Mmm.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.994
[groans]

09:38.077 --> 09:39.996
-[studio intro music plays]
-[grunts]

09:40.079 --> 09:42.331
[applause]

09:42.415 --> 09:43.958
This can't be right.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.418
[grunts]

09:46.752 --> 09:49.005
Cancel my drinks
with the mayor, Alfred.

09:49.088 --> 09:53.509
Tell him I'm taking my wife
and my adorable son
to the movies.

09:53.592 --> 09:54.885
Oh, right.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.680
Tell Martha to wear
those pearls I bought her.

09:57.763 --> 10:03.894
To symbolize how our love
can survive anything,
even bullets.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.855
Ugh! Two and a half hours
of this?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.732
-A little indulgent,
if you ask me.
-[Joker groans]

10:09.150 --> 10:10.985
What the hell is going on?

10:11.068 --> 10:12.778
Oh, I'll tell you
what's going on.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.906
You're a super villain
and you're going
to explain your plan?

10:15.990 --> 10:19.243
Hey, hey! Don't interrupt bae
when she's oratin'.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.246
What I would give to see you
wearing a headset mic.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.958
When the credits roll,
Harley and I are going
to kill you

10:26.042 --> 10:31.380
and announce that we're running
a new Legion of Doom
right here in Gotham.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.676
Wait, is Lex putting you
up to this because of
the evil lair tax?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.054
It's half a percent
for Christ's sakes!

10:38.137 --> 10:41.265
And it all goes towards
making Gotham College free.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.558
Good idea.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.185
You know,
the barrier to higher education

10:44.268 --> 10:46.562
is one of the biggest causes
of income inequality.

10:46.645 --> 10:50.107
Hey, Harley,
can we just, like, focus?

10:50.191 --> 10:52.902
Oh, shit. Ugh.
Must've left my bat
in the limo.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.528
Okay, I'm gonna pop out,
I'm gonna grab it,

10:54.612 --> 10:56.447
I will be back in a jiff
to commence skull-crushing,

10:56.530 --> 10:58.699
and, you know,
things of that nature.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.617
[grunts]

11:01.494 --> 11:02.328
[sighs]

11:07.124 --> 11:10.711
You know,
I've never known Harley
to be a sloppy ropeswoman.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.089
She's tied up
hundreds of people for me.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.967
Normally goes for a sheet bend
or a taut-line hitch,

11:17.051 --> 11:19.595
but she used
a bowline this time,

11:19.678 --> 11:23.265
which, of course,
is the easiest knot to untie.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.434
I'm very active
with Benecio's scout troop.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.813
So you become mayor
and suddenly you're, like,
a totally different person?

11:28.896 --> 11:31.232
I'm both
a maniacal force of nature,

11:31.315 --> 11:33.984
and I want
free universal health care.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.362
People can be more
than just one thing.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.906
They grow and evolve.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.616
Take Harley, for instance.

11:40.699 --> 11:45.162
Is it just me, or does she seem
a little different?

11:45.246 --> 11:47.123
Seriously, dude?

11:47.206 --> 11:49.750
I'm not gonna do that thing
where we commiserate over
the person we both dated.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.002
Of course, of course.

11:52.711 --> 11:53.963
Tell me this.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.006
Does she still put
one giant cardboard box

11:56.090 --> 11:59.135
in the recycling bin
so that nothing else can fit?

11:59.218 --> 12:01.178
Oh, my God, yes,
she does do that.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.014
But it's, it's just, it's like,
what's so hard about
breaking down a box?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.349
You know what I mean?
[chuckles]

12:05.433 --> 12:07.268
Just hit it
with your fucking bat.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.021
-[sighs]
-[grunts]

12:11.689 --> 12:12.523
Hmm.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.487
Okay. What is wrong with you?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.156
I mean, I know
there is a lot going on
in that little brain,

12:20.239 --> 12:21.866
but what is wrong right now?

12:21.949 --> 12:23.242
I shouldn't have come tonight.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.035
Okay, bro, calm down.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.121
All right? Let's try
one of those exercises
like last time.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.789
-All right, close your eyes.
-[breathing deeply]

12:28.873 --> 12:30.040
Deep breath in.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.750
Be in your body.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.711
I know what you've been through
and I know that you are strong.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.713
I was in your head, remember?

12:35.796 --> 12:37.006
You know my secret.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.257
Did you tell anyone?

12:38.340 --> 12:39.925
Okay.
I'm only gonna say this once,

12:40.009 --> 12:41.218
so pay attention.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.636
Gotham needs Batman
and I get that now.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.555
So your little secret
is safe with me.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.224
That, and like,
doctor-patient confidentiality,
that whole thing

12:47.308 --> 12:48.517
[sighs in relief]

12:48.601 --> 12:50.436
Thank you.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.313
How did Ivy take it
when she found out
you're not a villain anymore?

12:52.396 --> 12:53.689
Who said I'm not?

12:53.772 --> 12:55.608
Come on. Seriously?

12:55.691 --> 12:59.904
We're still doing this
after you stopped her plan
and saved the city?

12:59.987 --> 13:02.448
I used to think you were
just an agent of chaos.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.657
But now I see.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.617
-You--
-Uh, no!

13:04.700 --> 13:06.368
That is exactly who I am!

13:08.704 --> 13:09.955
[grunts]

13:10.039 --> 13:12.917
-God bless you, Harley Quinn.
-Eat shit, loser!

13:13.626 --> 13:15.211
Oh.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.254
Oh, my God,
has she always been
OCD about toilet paper?

13:17.338 --> 13:20.174
It's like nothing scares her
more than the idea
of running out.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.551
-Am I right?
-Oh, good times.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.137
You know what I really loved
about her though?

13:25.221 --> 13:29.141
The way she went along with
whatever plan I asked her
to do,

13:29.225 --> 13:30.893
even when I knew
she hated the idea.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.771
Well, you know, add that
to the shit pile of reasons

13:33.854 --> 13:36.106
you were a toxic partner
and a total narcissist.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.567
Oh, just me?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.194
What are you even
talking about?

13:40.277 --> 13:43.489
What Harley and I have
is 100% different.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.074
We are equals.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.951
I'd never ask her
to compromise herself
like you did.

13:47.034 --> 13:49.036
Well, maybe not on purpose.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.746
I'm sorry. What are you
implying right now?

13:50.829 --> 13:52.957
Yesterday she's stopping
your big plan,

13:53.040 --> 13:57.211
but today she's ready to go
hard-boiled, running
the Legion of Doom?

13:57.294 --> 13:59.338
I mean, I'm no therapist,

13:59.421 --> 14:02.424
but clearly Harley's having
second thoughts about
whatever you're doing here.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.511
And that was
a lapse in judgment,
and it won't be repeated.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.471
Harley's into
what we're doing here.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.849
I didn't want to bring out
the big guns, but...

14:10.933 --> 14:14.186
When did you ever see Harley
forget her bat?

14:14.937 --> 14:15.854
Oh, fuck.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.648
Let's kill the bozo!

14:17.731 --> 14:19.858
People don't need
to see another version
of the Wayne Murders.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.944
This shit's like
the Titanic, baby.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.654
-We know how it ends.
-Hey.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.614
You really want
to do this, Harley?

14:25.698 --> 14:26.615
Of course!

14:27.283 --> 14:28.242
I do.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.161
[Thomas grunts]

14:31.245 --> 14:35.124
[both grunting]

14:36.959 --> 14:38.961
Has Martha uttered a word yet?

14:39.044 --> 14:41.964
That CGI moustache
cost $12 million.

14:42.047 --> 14:42.881
[gunshot]

14:47.052 --> 14:48.220
[sighs]

14:48.304 --> 14:49.138
[gunshot]

14:49.221 --> 14:51.223
[groans, grunts]

14:51.307 --> 14:53.517
My big monologue! Hold my hand.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.936
Remember the horse
and the sparrow, son.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.063
[groans] "If you feed
the horse enough oats,

14:58.147 --> 15:01.775
some will pass through
to the road for the sparrows
to eat and prosper."

15:01.859 --> 15:06.071
You are proof
that anything is possible
if you're born into...

15:06.155 --> 15:09.325
[coughs]

15:09.408 --> 15:11.285
generational wealth.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.244
Let my death...

15:13.245 --> 15:15.414
define your entire life.

15:16.123 --> 15:20.753
[groaning]

15:22.463 --> 15:23.797
[sniffles]

15:23.881 --> 15:26.508
I fought for that line.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.178
Get out of the way
so I can bash
the mayor's head in.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.348
Hey, I have no problem with you
killing Joker right now,

15:32.431 --> 15:35.934
but not if you're only doing it
because it's what I want.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.269
Can we hurry this up?

15:37.353 --> 15:38.854
[scoffs] Would you listen
to this dick?

15:38.937 --> 15:40.648
Why wouldn't
I want to kill him?

15:40.731 --> 15:42.983
You did stop my plan
to terraform Gotham.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.985
Because of the zombies
and the barf.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.570
You're friends with Batgirl.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.489
Uh, friendly, not friends. No.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.741
And... [sighs]
I hate saying this,

15:50.824 --> 15:52.284
but, you know,
you've been reluctant

15:52.368 --> 15:54.787
to kill people
in a way that is,

15:54.870 --> 15:56.080
frankly, it's concerning to me.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.207
Oh, I'll show you reluctant.

15:58.290 --> 16:02.711
[both grunting]

16:02.795 --> 16:04.546
Harley. Face it.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.048
You've...

16:06.131 --> 16:07.716
[breathes heavily]

16:07.800 --> 16:09.218
You've evolved.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.928
You want to help people.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.638
You're not a villain anymore.

16:12.721 --> 16:13.889
That is not true!

16:13.972 --> 16:15.641
Why won't you just admit it?

16:15.724 --> 16:17.768
Because I don't want
to lose you.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.856
Do you really think
that you would lose me?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.233
If we don't want
the same thing,

16:24.316 --> 16:25.901
what does that mean for us?

16:25.984 --> 16:29.738
Look, if running
the Legion of Doom
with me isn't for you,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.281
that's-- it's okay.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.492
I don't want you
to compromise yourself.

16:33.575 --> 16:36.245
I mean, we're equals
in this relationship,

16:36.328 --> 16:37.996
and that's why it's so great.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.749
We can fully have
different passions.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.919
I mean, if I didn't leave you
during your craft beer phase,

16:44.002 --> 16:45.587
I'm not leaving you now.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.631
Yeah, no. I could not pull off
those cargo shorts. [scoffs]

16:47.715 --> 16:50.300
Look, as long as
you're honest with me,

16:50.384 --> 16:53.137
I will support
whatever you want to do.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.931
But... what if I don't know
exactly what that is?

16:56.014 --> 16:57.266
Like...

16:57.349 --> 16:58.934
Look, I, I know
I don't want to kill Joker,

16:59.017 --> 17:01.395
and I... I don't want to do
a big, evil plan, but,

17:01.478 --> 17:03.981
do I want to help people? I--
Maybe. I don't know.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.608
I just-- I haven't really
let myself think about it.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.527
People are saying
I'm not a villain anymore,

17:08.610 --> 17:10.612
which is fine, like, whatever.
Labels are lame.

17:10.696 --> 17:14.742
But I-- I'm not ready
to identify as the other thing.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.953
You know what?
We're going to figure
it out together. Right?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.538
BFFGFFs?

17:19.621 --> 17:20.539
That's us, right?

17:20.622 --> 17:21.874
Right.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.917
-[Harley chuckles]
-Beautiful stuff.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.461
What time is it?

17:25.544 --> 17:27.129
Where the fuck
do you need to be?

17:27.212 --> 17:30.174
-[applause]
-[crowd chanting] Billy Bob!
Billy Bob!

17:30.257 --> 17:31.925
Billy Bob! Billy Bob!

17:32.009 --> 17:34.303
They should be
chanting my name.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.637
Play it cool, baby.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.765
You've made it this far.
Accept the applause.

17:37.848 --> 17:42.311
Give a faux-humble bow,
and sit your ass down.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.604
[grunting]

17:43.687 --> 17:46.440
-[applause continues]
-[man whistles]

17:46.523 --> 17:48.317
Oh, no.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.653
It is not Billy Bob
whose performance
has moved you all this evening.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.156
It is I, Clayface,

17:54.239 --> 17:56.867
the true star
behind Thomas Wayne.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.871
Billy Bob is a shape shifter?
That's how he does it.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.165
No, I'm not Billy Bob!

18:03.248 --> 18:05.834
He doesn't deserve
your applause.

18:05.918 --> 18:06.919
I do!

18:08.086 --> 18:09.797
Billy Bob is dead!

18:09.880 --> 18:12.090
-Dead because of me!
-Look, buddy.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.801
They're just not listening.

18:13.884 --> 18:18.180
Congrats to Billy Bob Thornton
on a spectacular performance.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.351
This movie reminds us that
billionaires like Bruce Wayne
know no shame.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.729
The real drain
on the city is the 1%.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.524
But today we come
one step closer to ending

18:28.607 --> 18:32.361
the appalling
wealth disparity in Gotham.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.530
Send in the clowns!

18:35.155 --> 18:37.908
[engine revving]

18:43.288 --> 18:44.706
Oh. Uh.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.542
This is a sting operation.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.878
Public humiliation has
a long history
in the annals of justice.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.214
So we lured you into our trap.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.633
And now we're busting you
for tax evasion.

18:54.716 --> 18:58.220
Ladies and gentlemen,
and non-binary friends,

18:58.303 --> 19:02.182
this is for you.
[laughing maniacally]

19:02.266 --> 19:03.892
And for me.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.104
"Bruce Wayne,
you are under arrest
for intentional omission.

19:07.187 --> 19:12.067
manipulation, and alteration
of accounting records."

19:12.150 --> 19:16.572
He's also guilty
of being a thief and a bitch.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.450
Wow! Huba-hub.
What's with the glow up, Ivy?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.077
And that's three.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.495
You're goddamn right it is.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.289
I need a fucking drink!

19:25.372 --> 19:28.250
Let's go get blackout
on bulk champagne.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.461
[Harley] Deep breaths.

19:31.545 --> 19:32.754
You will be okay.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.757
I know... I think?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.593
Maybe this is a good thing.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.762
I have all this trauma
I've been carrying around.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.347
If I can finally
go deal with it,

19:42.431 --> 19:44.933
I can get back
to the life I want.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.895
Helping people
and protecting Gotham.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.272
It's exciting. And scary.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.524
It is both of those things.

19:55.027 --> 19:59.323
Hey, not to add to your trauma,
but I think Selina stole
your mom's pearls.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.617
Oh, come on.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.036
I'll be available
for lame zoom sessions
if you need me.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.789
[indistinct shouting]

20:07.873 --> 20:10.083
Excuse me.
Coming through. Pardon me.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.835
Can you give us a minute, Carl?

20:11.919 --> 20:15.422
Blackgate Penitentiary is
30 clicks off the port
of Gotham.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.132
I'll have Nightwing
gas up the BatBoat--

20:17.215 --> 20:19.593
Don't bother.
I intend to serve my time.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.054
The people of the city have
to know there are consequences,

20:22.137 --> 20:23.263
even for me.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.640
While I'm gone,

20:24.723 --> 20:26.308
I need you to step up,

20:26.391 --> 20:29.478
lead the Bat-Family,
and protect Gotham.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.855
We can't do that
without Batman.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.523
Of course you can.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.484
You've already done it.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.361
You stopped the Mad Hatter.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.655
You helped stop the zombies
when I was...

20:39.738 --> 20:41.406
[sighs] indisposed.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.576
Gotham is in good hands.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.002
Huh?

20:54.878 --> 20:56.505
Mmm.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.840
Oh, so there were
some hiccups tonight.

20:58.924 --> 21:02.803
But if it helps,
you win my best actor award.

21:02.886 --> 21:03.762
A hug.

21:05.555 --> 21:06.431
It doesn't.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.437
So, okay, that's,
so that's what you've decided.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.022
It is. [sighs]

21:14.106 --> 21:16.817
I was alone for so long,
carrying around
all this trauma.

21:16.900 --> 21:21.613
But then I met you
and I fell in love,
which helped me get past it.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.117
I'm finally in a place
where I can actually think
about what I want.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.326
It's exciting.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.286
And scary.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.580
I'm proud of you.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.500
So, is Lex gonna be pissed
you didn't kill Joker?

21:33.583 --> 21:35.210
Oh, he'll probably want me
even more now...

21:35.293 --> 21:37.337
Mmm. God knows I do.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.215
[both moan]

21:40.298 --> 21:41.174
[Harley chuckles]

21:48.765 --> 21:49.808
[Harley] Hey, assholes!

21:51.351 --> 21:52.352
Uh.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.688
Harley?
What are you doing here?

21:54.771 --> 21:58.066
Yeah, with Batty in the clink,
I thought you silly rodents
might need a little help. Hmm.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.651
Don't worry, Nightwing.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.486
You still have the best
looking ass out of all of us.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.155
Mmm, let's give her a chance.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.990
You ready?

22:05.073 --> 22:06.950
Uh, like in general,
or is there something specific
we need to do?

22:07.034 --> 22:09.619
-Welcome to the fam, Harley!
-[both grunting]

22:11.913 --> 22:12.748
Whoa!

22:17.127 --> 22:19.254
Thanks for waiting,
you fucking dildos!

22:20.547 --> 22:21.590
I'll take the stairs.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.677
[theme music playing]
