01:09.800 --> 01:13.122
Tatang, are we going back right away?

01:13.960 --> 01:14.961
I was hoping to go somewhere after.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.530
I told you about it, remember?

01:20.400 --> 01:22.562
A pack of Marlboro.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.721
Here.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.646
Here you go.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.811
It's crazy here...

02:16.000 --> 02:17.684
but I like it this Way.

02:20.520 --> 02:21.931
How many policemen passed by?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.207
Did you see the alley by the corner?

02:26.400 --> 02:29.563
Did you count your change?

02:31.160 --> 02:32.730
It's five pesos short.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.808
- Fuck that asshole!
- Let it go, asshole.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.881
He's dead!

04:35.040 --> 04:36.451
Dead man!

04:48.440 --> 04:51.649
A man was shot and killed today... in Quezon City.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.046
He tried to run away...

04:53.120 --> 04:54.849
and he was shot.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.447
Drugs may be the main motive in the murder...

04:58.560 --> 05:01.325
since the victim was a reported drug runner.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.280
Let us make a solemn oath among ourselves...

05:04.520 --> 05:05.646
to stand committed...

05:05.640 --> 05:07.563
to serve the Filipino People.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.848
Last election, we demanded...

05:10.960 --> 05:12.291
if there is no corruption...

05:12.400 --> 05:13.401
there is no poverty.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.405
NRP! NRP!

05:16.640 --> 05:20.167
The COMELEC is making preparations...

05:20.160 --> 05:22.925
the PNP and the AFP for the elections.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.445
Businesses are pulling out investments...

05:24.440 --> 05:26.044
from the Philippines.
Seen by the continuous drop in value of the Peso.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.844
We cannot treat vendors and squatters...

05:27.960 --> 05:31.089
the same way we treat criminals.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.243
An anti-crime group criticized the police?

05:34.240 --> 05:35.844
For the rampant crime?

05:35.840 --> 05:37.729
In Metro Manila.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.725
Camera footage shows the suspect...

05:45.720 --> 05:48.690
leaving New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.682
They might be comfortable in killing other people...

05:50.680 --> 05:53.081
because someone supports them.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.606
If we keep electing the same politicians...

05:55.680 --> 05:57.842
true change will never come.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.005
Soldiers opened fire on us.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.611
Total gun ban shall be implemented.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.284
Why did you have to take his life?

06:07.360 --> 06:08.521
You killed my child!

06:08.520 --> 06:11.683
His face was caught on the CCTV camera.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.802
The gunmen pulled out their guns?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.205
The victim was dead on the spot.
Bystanders were caught in the crossfire.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.326
According to witnesses?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.801
John Paul was the one passing the bullets?

06:18.960 --> 06:20.325
While the other was firing the gun.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.401
The gunman knew what he was doing?

06:21.400 --> 06:22.162
Professional.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.171
He was hit with an assault rifle in the leg?

06:26.360 --> 06:28.647
And other parts of the body.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.801
The victim was dead on the spot.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.049
They were used as human shields.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.405
A businessman was killed...

06:43.520 --> 06:45.966
after he was shot in Manila.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.371
We are investigating if he has...

06:47.360 --> 06:49.931
certain involvement with the company...

06:49.920 --> 06:51.126
of certain personalities.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.122
For God's sake!

06:52.160 --> 06:54.128
Stop dragging his name in politics!

06:54.240 --> 06:56.049
Let us mourn him in peace!

06:59.200 --> 07:00.645
What a crowd right, 'Tang?

07:01.160 --> 07:04.562
I had a hard time escaping.
Did you, know, I had to pass the...

07:04.600 --> 07:06.648
I'll drop you off at Morayta, 'Tang...

07:07.400 --> 07:09.402
and then I'll pick you up around 7.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.530
I'll stay out for the night.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.011
I'll go back tomorrow.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.724
So it will just be you, Daniel?

07:16.760 --> 07:18.330
Ma'am Thelma, could I just...

07:18.560 --> 07:20.642
go back tomorrow with Tatang?

07:21.720 --> 07:24.200
You'd really risk so much for a few hours.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.121
Rex will get you for this again.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.322
By the way... I have to pay for some stuff...

07:32.320 --> 07:34.243
Daniel needs an advance.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.001
Just take it out of his pay tomorrow.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.362
How much?

07:39.440 --> 07:41.681
Six thousand...

07:41.800 --> 07:44.246
I have to pay for...

07:44.600 --> 07:47.331
my mom's dialysis, their electric bill...

07:47.920 --> 07:49.126
and also for my motel.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.646
And also for my motel.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.971
Thanks!

07:56.520 --> 08:00.445
Text Rex that you won't make it tonight.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.961
Want to eat? It's my treat. Come on!

08:31.960 --> 08:33.200
No thanks.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.244
No, I'll go ahead.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.046
Want me to go with you?

08:37.400 --> 08:38.525
No way.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.286
- Daniel?
- Mama?

09:09.560 --> 09:13.645
- How are you?
- Daniel, how have you been?

09:13.800 --> 09:16.167
David, come. Your brother is on the phone.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.646
- How are things?
- We're good. How about you?

09:20.640 --> 09:22.642
I knew you were going to call.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.842
I had a strong feeling.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.526
Sorry it took me a while.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.324
I was out in the desert last week.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.606
I've been really busy.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.767
It's okay!

09:31.760 --> 09:34.570
I just saw Dubai on TV.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.887
There were Arabs everywhere!

09:36.960 --> 09:38.610
I remembered you.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.370
There are lots of them here!

09:40.600 --> 09:41.886
If you could only smell them.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.370
They don't take baths.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.608
Really? So do you always cover your nose?

09:47.800 --> 09:49.768
Ma?

09:50.160 --> 09:51.810
Does Badong still visit?

09:52.440 --> 09:53.805
Of course not.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.084
Why do you ask?

09:58.920 --> 10:00.922
I can't send money this month.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.407
Save what you can for now.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.004
That's okay. Don't worry.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.968
I'll just wait for it.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.731
It's hot!

10:24.640 --> 10:26.085
Mar.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.605
Stop it!

10:29.840 --> 10:31.171
You're horny again!

10:31.200 --> 10:32.929
Save it for later!

10:35.240 --> 10:36.765
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

10:37.160 --> 10:38.321
8 o'clock.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.444
Eat first, will you?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.644
Pa?

10:49.680 --> 10:50.761
Tina?

10:50.880 --> 10:52.564
When did you arrive?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.407
Just a while ago.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.086
I got a day off...

10:58.200 --> 10:59.690
but I have to go back tomorrow.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.005
This is Ruel.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.167
My boyfriend.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.044
He's also taking up Law.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.364
Good evening.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.884
You already have a boyfriend?

11:11.440 --> 11:12.646
Come on, Pa.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.085
I'm already 24.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.331
Is that so?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.604
Come join us for dinner.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.722
Come on.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.005
Ruel, let's eat.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.325
How is Cebu?

11:24.680 --> 11:26.728
Still the same.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.921
Lonely...

11:29.360 --> 11:30.691
hot...

11:31.080 --> 11:32.411
and crowded.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.403
Is that why you look so pale?

11:36.560 --> 11:39.404
I'm sure you're always locked up inside.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.523
How's school?

11:52.880 --> 11:57.329
That Law school is taking forever.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.965
I'll finish soon.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.242
Next year, I'll take my bar exams.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.364
And then once I become Atty. Maghari...

12:04.520 --> 12:06.284
you can finally retire.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.009
But I'm still strong!

12:09.360 --> 12:11.806
And we'll need the extra money.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.765
- I'll I go ahead.
- Eat first

12:38.800 --> 12:39.881
Don't you have class?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.331
I do, later.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.888
- But I still have money.
- Use it for school.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.202
When are you coming back?

13:05.040 --> 13:06.280
I don't know.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.409
If my boss is in a good mood...

13:08.640 --> 13:09.801
I'll ask for leave again.

13:10.040 --> 13:14.011
I hope you can come home more often.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.407
<i>I'll</i> try.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.526
Pa...

13:25.120 --> 13:26.565
Mario, you forgot something!

13:28.520 --> 13:30.602
Your shirt.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.724
I'll try, okay?

13:38.280 --> 13:40.123
Take this with you.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.770
Please take care.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.005
And you...

13:51.000 --> 13:52.843
watch out for that Ruel.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.365
Don't let him make you cry.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.885
Of course not, Pa.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.768
Don't you save what you earn?

14:09.880 --> 14:12.326
Thelma said more jobs are coming in.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.969
If you can still drink...

14:31.960 --> 14:33.724
once Rex is done with you.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.125
Hell yeah!

14:38.200 --> 14:39.406
That's a lot of money.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.845
When do you think I can earn as much?

14:42.520 --> 14:43.851
Don't rush.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.925
I was a backup for three years
before I got promoted.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.085
Do you think...

14:49.200 --> 14:50.804
Thelma will hire me?

14:51.280 --> 14:52.964
Do you think she's annoyed at me?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.770
That's what's worrying you?

14:55.960 --> 14:59.521
Ask me if I'm annoyed at you.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.761
Two of these.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.410
Wait!

15:09.120 --> 15:10.326
For you!

15:42.560 --> 15:43.925
How was the trip?

15:44.240 --> 15:45.844
I saw it on the news.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.603
Next time, we'll bring you chocolates.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.364
Right?

15:56.560 --> 15:58.369
Let's go to Lydia's.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.441
Make mine a double.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.726
One isn't enough.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.081
I'll take care of it.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.166
Santos...

17:01.320 --> 17:02.810
go ahead and clear the way.

17:02.800 --> 17:03.801
Yes sir.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.761
Where have you been?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.006
Why did you spend the night out?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.083
Hey!

18:18.120 --> 18:19.531
What took you so long?

18:19.680 --> 18:22.729
Did you build a fucking monument?
But the warden's house was huge!

18:22.760 --> 18:23.841
Don't make excuses with me!

18:23.880 --> 18:25.245
Beat them up!

18:40.680 --> 18:42.364
Warden wants you.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.408
You're lucky. Get out of my face.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.200
Beat him up!

18:50.040 --> 18:51.724
I said beat him up!

19:00.000 --> 19:01.331
Warden.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.129
This came for you.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.929
It's going through.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.246
It's official.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.250
They'll let us know next month.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.006
Take this.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.323
Be good this time.

19:59.000 --> 19:59.569
Francis.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.050
Dad.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.847
You already met Renato.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.882
Wally, from the 3rd district.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.881
Of course you haven't met General Pacheco.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.048
My son-in-law, Francis.

20:14.520 --> 20:15.965
It's nice to finally meet you sir.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.804
Philippine Military Academy, Class of 2005.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.604
Top of his class!

20:21.000 --> 20:23.241
Then you're better than your dad.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.046
If I remember correctly...

20:26.040 --> 20:28.281
he was only 3rd or 4th in his class.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.003
I'm sure you're good at golf.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.770
I don't play, sir.

20:34.680 --> 20:38.844
But your father was such a player.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.446
General...

20:44.000 --> 20:45.161
Nobody move!

20:47.920 --> 20:49.251
Get out of the way!

20:53.360 --> 20:54.646
I said out of the way!

20:55.200 --> 20:56.247
Police!

20:57.560 --> 20:59.050
Nobody move!

20:59.760 --> 21:01.091
Stay where you are!

21:02.000 --> 21:03.764
Wait a minute!

21:04.040 --> 21:05.530
Where's your warrant?

21:05.640 --> 21:06.880
Warrant?

21:12.040 --> 21:12.962
Here's your warrant!

21:13.040 --> 21:14.041
My tooth...

21:14.600 --> 21:15.647
Who killed Tiu?

21:15.840 --> 21:16.568
<i>“U?</i>

21:16.560 --> 21:18.164
I don't know any Tiu.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.567
Wait! Stop!

21:20.600 --> 21:22.090
I was here all day yesterday!

21:22.280 --> 21:23.611
I didn't leave the house!

21:23.680 --> 21:24.761
My stomach was acting up.

21:24.840 --> 21:25.966
- You didn't leave?
- No!

21:29.240 --> 21:31.288
- You didn't leave?
- That's right.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.644
What are you doing?

21:35.720 --> 21:37.370
Wait!

21:38.440 --> 21:39.930
Stop it sir!

21:40.520 --> 21:42.761
Oh, for fuck's sake! Do you know who he is now?

21:42.920 --> 21:44.365
I know him!

21:44.400 --> 21:47.290
He protects the drug dealers in this area.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.770
But that was before.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.444
No one tries to go against them.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.243
Do they have friends in uniform?

21:54.800 --> 21:56.689
Why is it taking so long?

21:56.960 --> 21:58.610
Son of a bitch!

21:59.240 --> 22:00.890
We have a guest!

22:02.440 --> 22:04.090
Yes they have lots.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.722
Even criminals are afraid of them.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.884
Once, a rich Chinese man conned Tiu.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.925
The next day, he was dead.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.324
Local Police is handling the case.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.761
Salcedo isn't one of us.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.008
He'll make things difficult.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.202
Maybe he wants more.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.328
Those assholes are greedy.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.291
His wife is running...

22:31.320 --> 22:32.845
this coming election.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.240
For councilor.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.689
That's why he needs to lie low.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.882
I can pull some strings...

22:39.400 --> 22:42.085
and have the case transferred to the NBI.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.521
From there, Francis can take over.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.445
We need a veteran to handle this.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.404
What if your boy fails?

22:50.520 --> 22:53.569
Our election plans are at stake.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.369
Ben can take care of this.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.722
The faster we close this...

23:01.120 --> 23:02.690
the better.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.086
You can do this, right?

23:06.240 --> 23:07.765
Besides, he's family.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.201
I trusted him with my daughter...

23:10.800 --> 23:13.167
why not trust him with the business too?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.002
Because I don't trust him.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.930
Whatever you say...

23:20.000 --> 23:22.162
he's still Coronel's son.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.762
Maybe you forgot what his father did.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.966
He almost ruined the military.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.768
If you don't trust me...

23:36.600 --> 23:38.807
Nicky's waiting for me, dad.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.241
I'm telling you...

23:46.400 --> 23:49.244
he's going to be the youngest NBI Chief.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.006
He's ambitious.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.923
The more important question is...

23:53.680 --> 23:56.081
can you control him?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.206
Dad, thanks but...

24:23.640 --> 24:25.005
I can't accept this.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.047
They'll audit me at the office.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.650
For God's sake! It's a gift!

24:27.640 --> 24:30.405
They can check my records for all I care!

24:30.440 --> 24:32.090
Is that dad?

24:34.200 --> 24:36.168
- Hello dad?
- What? Let's go!

24:36.160 --> 24:37.969
Dad wants to talk to you.

24:38.280 --> 24:39.327
Why?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.604
Wait! I'm coming with you.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.561
Francis, don't return it.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.608
He'll get really mad if you do.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.525
Come on. It's a nice car!

24:50.920 --> 24:53.287
It's a lot better than your old car.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.282
You'll get used to it.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.690
Acosta, the chief is looking for you.

25:02.520 --> 25:03.760
Sir!

25:04.720 --> 25:05.881
Acosta.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.721
This is A.l.C. Francisco Coronel Jr.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.849
And S.l. Samuel Bernabe, of the NBI.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.163
They'll be handling Tiu's case.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.809
Hand over everything to them.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.446
Who gave the order...

25:20.640 --> 25:21.641
sir?

25:22.520 --> 25:23.931
That's none of your business.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.168
It's between me and Posadas.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.449
So turn over everything to them.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.807
Now.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.571
Sergeant, do we have a problem?

25:33.120 --> 25:34.201
Maybe you do!

25:34.440 --> 25:35.601
Because I don't.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.562
What else do you need?

25:36.640 --> 25:37.562
Leads?

25:37.600 --> 25:39.728
Oh wait, you already have them.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.242
Wait...

25:41.520 --> 25:43.249
maybe you want coffee?

25:43.880 --> 25:45.530
How about a massage?

25:47.760 --> 25:49.410
We'll work on this case.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.049
It was moved up because it's a priority.

25:55.560 --> 25:56.971
How old are you?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.165
Thirty-two, why?

25:59.520 --> 26:00.601
Thirty-two...

26:00.840 --> 26:02.410
Know what?

26:03.280 --> 26:04.611
That's how long I've been in service.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.571
So don't play stupid with me.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.280
We all know powerful people...

26:09.280 --> 26:10.247
are involved here.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.289
I hope you really work on this case.

26:12.520 --> 26:15.524
Not just wait for it to solve itself.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.729
Are you telling us how to do our job?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.207
Like that shoot-out case in Pasay.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.007
Wait...

26:22.160 --> 26:24.640
was it ever solved?

26:25.080 --> 26:26.764
Didn't you guys take that case too?

26:41.640 --> 26:43.563
He'll get it from me.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.767
Don't.

26:45.040 --> 26:45.848
Leave him.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.200
That's why he's still a sergeant...

26:47.200 --> 26:48.122
at his age.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.401
It's not worth it.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.324
Do you see this?

26:55.200 --> 26:56.690
I worked hard for all of this.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.530
We're the same then.

27:09.840 --> 27:10.921
Here it is.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.449
All the evidence you need.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.371
There's more.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.081
But we won't bring it to you.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.410
Work a little.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.769
That fucking old man.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.164
My parole's been approved.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.842
I can work full time once I'm out of here.

27:38.200 --> 27:41.090
'Tang, that's impossible.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.286
Why not?

27:44.680 --> 27:46.170
I can still work.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.244
Don't you know why I get prisoners?

27:49.920 --> 27:52.446
Because outsiders are headaches.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.123
We'll still have the same deal.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.324
Nothing will change.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.962
You're easy to work with because...

28:02.400 --> 28:04.402
you can't complain.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.325
You need the money.

28:07.160 --> 28:11.609
Once you're out, things will change.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.042
You'll be able to choose.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.607
Too bad, there's a lot of work coming in.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.084
What will happen when I leave?

28:22.760 --> 28:24.603
Who'll replace me?

28:25.200 --> 28:27.441
At work, someone retires...

28:27.920 --> 28:30.571
so new graduates can come in.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.124
How's Daniel?

28:37.160 --> 28:39.322
Make sure he's ready.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.089
Don't disappoint me.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.765
Eating again?

28:51.520 --> 28:52.760
Hey! Porkchop!

28:52.760 --> 28:53.727
I'll take care of it!

28:53.760 --> 28:56.411
Later!

29:01.720 --> 29:03.449
Add more salt! Okay?

29:04.440 --> 29:05.680
What?

29:05.840 --> 29:07.808
I'll make you eat all that salt!

29:08.200 --> 29:09.645
Okay?

29:18.040 --> 29:19.849
- Wash it...
- Hey, handsome!

29:20.680 --> 29:22.523
Fucking faggot!

29:22.960 --> 29:24.246
Son of a bitch.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.329
Wash it properly!

29:28.640 --> 29:30.005
The hell you looking at, faggot!

29:30.160 --> 29:31.924
Sorry, handsome.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.688
Don't give Daniel anything, okay?

29:35.200 --> 29:36.042
Hey,you!

29:36.040 --> 29:37.690
What are you doing?

29:40.720 --> 29:42.404
Is it done?

29:45.120 --> 29:46.929
I even made it smell good.

29:48.680 --> 29:49.841
Here!

29:50.000 --> 29:52.002
Bring cigarettes next time.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.846
Hey, we have a game later!

30:03.000 --> 30:04.729
Hell no! You suck at it.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.204
Get off the fucking phone!

30:44.320 --> 30:46.049
Hey! Is it ready?

30:46.720 --> 30:48.529
Here's your porkchop.

30:51.720 --> 30:54.166
Get out of here before Simeon sees you.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.570
The fuck do I care?

30:57.640 --> 31:01.247
- I have diabetes!
- It'll be cigarettes next time.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.011
It's you again!

31:04.960 --> 31:06.246
What's this?

31:09.840 --> 31:11.251
I said no special treatment...

31:11.240 --> 31:12.571
for this son of a bitch!

31:16.920 --> 31:20.367
Who the fuck do you think you are?

31:24.320 --> 31:25.890
Don't mess with me.

31:26.440 --> 31:27.805
Is this what you want?

31:28.280 --> 31:29.691
This isn't for you.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.724
This is for my rats.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.249
That son of a bitch Simeon.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.727
I'll get him for this.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.131
That motherfucker.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.731
He's always on my case.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.529
Don't be cocky.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.646
You're the one asking for favors.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.606
What's this?

32:08.320 --> 32:12.848
Son of a bitch!

32:13.360 --> 32:16.045
Tatang's getting paroled!

32:16.960 --> 32:18.564
You're getting out?

32:21.000 --> 32:24.641
- You're getting out before me!
- Fuck, you'll be here forever!

32:24.880 --> 32:25.961
Crazy old fuck.

32:25.960 --> 32:26.847
So, wait.

32:26.960 --> 32:30.601
Does Thelma know about this?

32:31.080 --> 32:32.081
Yes.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.971
I already told her.

32:34.440 --> 32:35.771
So you're going full-time?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.046
No.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.250
I'm retired.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.926
What?

32:43.320 --> 32:44.890
- How's that?
- I don't know.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.649
I'll drive a cab or something.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.405
What about the job?

32:53.800 --> 32:55.450
I'll be frank.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.290
You're not ready for this.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.321
What the...

33:00.360 --> 33:01.566
Come on!

33:01.800 --> 33:03.450
Of course I learned from you.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.210
That's what I've been saying!

33:08.200 --> 33:09.850
You're too cocky!

33:10.240 --> 33:11.571
Fuck, let's be serious.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.120
I'm ready.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.645
This is mine. This is me.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.411
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'll do everything!

33:17.520 --> 33:18.931
Take off your shoes.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.327
What?

33:20.600 --> 33:21.965
If you want to learn...

33:22.280 --> 33:23.520
do as I say.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.523
No questions asked.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.165
If you can't do it...

33:27.160 --> 33:28.366
tell me now.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.050
Spare me the headache.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.166
First of all...

33:32.280 --> 33:37.320
always blend in.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.969
Keep a low profile.

33:40.920 --> 33:44.641
So you won't be envied by others...

33:45.800 --> 33:47.370
especially the guards.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.206
Give that to Rex.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.765
Bring it to him now.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.525
This is for you.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.884
Don't forget...

34:04.040 --> 34:09.763
we earn because they let us work.

34:10.800 --> 34:14.282
But don't treat them as friends.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.770
This is just work.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.931
Just work.

34:52.280 --> 34:53.850
My son-in-law, Francis.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.721
You think this job is easy?

35:14.200 --> 35:17.204
If we fail and this thing blows up...

35:17.640 --> 35:21.326
it may expose even the President.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.042
Your bill's been watered down.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.690
Is that okay?

35:32.400 --> 35:34.801
You have to give...

35:35.160 --> 35:36.889
to get what you want.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.723
Compromise is the key.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.729
That's what you have to learn.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.330
When you're starting out...

35:44.160 --> 35:46.049
you should sway like bamboo.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.322
Now...

35:47.600 --> 35:48.965
When you're at the top...

35:49.320 --> 35:54.360
then you can be as stiff
and rigid like a flag pole.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.287
I don't want to be a politician anyway.

36:00.960 --> 36:03.281
You want to just keep on catching criminals?

36:04.520 --> 36:06.010
That's fine too.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.011
But here...

36:08.360 --> 36:11.011
we make laws.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.243
We make a nation.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.127
Wake up.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.766
Can you do what I do?

36:25.560 --> 36:26.925
Of course.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.929
If you really want to make a difference...

36:29.640 --> 36:31.085
aim for the congress.

36:32.040 --> 36:34.247
This is the path towards the presidency.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.643
I still have a lot to learn.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.922
I can teach you.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.641
Don't worry. I'll help you out.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.645
Who do you want?

36:51.800 --> 36:53.086
What are you doing?

36:55.440 --> 36:56.851
Where are you taking me?

36:58.600 --> 37:00.682
We're just workers here.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.684
Whatever the orders, whoever it is...

37:03.680 --> 37:06.126
we have to do it.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.242
This is a matter of public interest.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.521
I need you to take care of something for me.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.563
What are the details?

37:12.760 --> 37:14.171
Don't you trust me Francis?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.446
Don't ask any questions.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.365
Just do this for me.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.969
And keep it confidential, okay?

37:25.080 --> 37:27.048
You said you'd do anything.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.247
What?

37:30.840 --> 37:32.080
Hey!

37:35.880 --> 37:37.166
It's easy to kill...

37:37.160 --> 37:41.404
if you're angry at the person.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.330
Motherfucker!

38:28.080 --> 38:30.048
What if you're ordered...

38:30.080 --> 38:32.162
to kill an old man...

38:32.160 --> 38:33.889
who can barely walk?

38:34.760 --> 38:36.330
Could you still do it?

38:37.840 --> 38:39.888
Don't stab him a hundred times.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.044
It should be clean...

38:44.360 --> 38:45.646
simple.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.886
Don't make a mess this time.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.003
One in the chest to bring them down.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.085
Another in the head...

39:05.520 --> 39:06.965
to be sure.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.522
Stabbing is hard.

39:09.560 --> 39:12.928
You feel the blade entering the flesh.

39:13.760 --> 39:17.446
You can see the pain on your target's face.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.644
No, please. No.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.843
Can you still do it?

39:44.840 --> 39:47.810
You know why they do that?

39:49.240 --> 39:50.605
It's for insurance.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.244
But if we screw up...

39:54.720 --> 39:57.291
we're not just going to get fired.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.644
They know everything about us.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.961
The illegal recruiter you killed...

40:09.520 --> 40:11.284
where your family lives...

40:11.360 --> 40:13.283
even your ex-girlfriend.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.004
They know where she is.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.366
Chief.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.970
What's this Tiu case?

41:30.600 --> 41:31.726
Do you know?

41:32.760 --> 41:34.922
We're going to Mt. Pinatubo.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.885
Bring Nicky along.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.089
Let's break-in your car.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.208
Who was your first hit?

41:48.320 --> 41:50.402
You must've had a hard time too.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.001
How many shots did it take?

41:53.120 --> 41:54.724
It probably took a lot.

41:55.080 --> 41:59.165
Just one, while he was sleeping.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.088
Then I just thought of myself.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.242
I didn't want to rot away in jail.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.729
Who did you choose?

42:11.400 --> 42:13.368
He was chosen for me.

42:15.680 --> 42:18.001
Thelma heard he was about to rat them out.

42:18.600 --> 42:21.001
I was his backup for three years.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.122
We'll never know.

42:31.120 --> 42:34.090
If one day, I screw up...

42:35.080 --> 42:37.048
and they order you to kill me.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.844
You should still do it.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.762
It's just work, nothing personal.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.568
That's impossible.

42:47.640 --> 42:48.801
Come on!

42:49.240 --> 42:51.163
You'll never screw up.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.564
But you are going to kill me?

42:54.800 --> 42:56.325
You cocksucker!

42:58.320 --> 42:59.651
Fuckit

43:00.040 --> 43:01.246
I won't.

43:02.920 --> 43:04.206
I won't.

43:06.600 --> 43:07.840
What about Tina?

43:07.960 --> 43:10.281
How about her?

43:10.560 --> 43:12.801
She still has a year to go before her Bar exam.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.130
Didn't you save up?

43:15.280 --> 43:16.327
Save up?

43:16.440 --> 43:18.568
I'm just trying to make ends meet.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.443
Everything's expensive now.

43:30.320 --> 43:32.163
We can do it.

43:38.320 --> 43:39.970
Stop it!

43:40.880 --> 43:42.689
Is that a new perfume?

43:43.280 --> 43:44.645
So what?

43:51.000 --> 43:53.606
Let's have another baby.

43:53.840 --> 43:54.841
What the hell?

43:54.920 --> 43:56.843
We're too old for that!

44:01.520 --> 44:03.045
Are you free next week?

44:03.160 --> 44:04.446
We have a mock trial.

44:04.440 --> 44:05.771
I was hoping you could go.

44:05.800 --> 44:08.007
You know he can't make it.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.446
He can't just go home whenever he wants.

44:11.440 --> 44:14.523
Don't worry. I'll be retiring soon.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.931
You'll get sick of seeing me every day.

45:02.040 --> 45:03.530
You and me, okay?

45:04.880 --> 45:07.087
Can you do it?

45:08.640 --> 45:10.324
I'm your backup today.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.287
Faster, they need it now!

45:39.680 --> 45:41.284
I'll bring it right away.

46:07.320 --> 46:08.845
Finish it!

46:17.400 --> 46:19.368
Let's go!

46:59.560 --> 47:00.721
Let's go!

47:06.920 --> 47:08.206
Tell us what you know.

47:08.280 --> 47:09.964
It will be a big help.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.764
I don't know anything.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.081
I'm just a driver.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.605
It's been ages since I last drove him.

47:14.680 --> 47:16.648
Don't lie to me.

47:17.280 --> 47:18.645
You were always with him!

47:18.720 --> 47:21.166
You know where he goes and who he talks to!

47:21.160 --> 47:22.241
I already told you everything.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.162
What more do you want?

47:23.160 --> 47:24.366
We need a name!

47:24.520 --> 47:25.851
If you're not filing a case...

47:25.840 --> 47:27.649
then let me go. This is illegal.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.245
Nothing is illegal!

47:30.720 --> 47:32.290
Give me a name. Now!

47:32.440 --> 47:33.168
Ex-O.

47:33.240 --> 47:35.083
Who else worked with Tiu?

47:35.320 --> 47:36.970
Pol! Pol! The former policeman!

47:36.960 --> 47:39.088
They always spoke before he died!

47:43.960 --> 47:45.007
Pol!

47:45.640 --> 47:46.721
Joaquin...

47:47.240 --> 47:49.004
I need your help.

47:49.800 --> 47:50.528
Shooﬂ

47:50.520 --> 47:51.328
What happened?

47:51.400 --> 47:55.564
They killed Linda.

47:56.040 --> 47:59.408
I don't know where the kids are.

47:59.680 --> 48:00.727
Fuck!

48:00.800 --> 48:01.722
Who did this?

48:01.720 --> 48:02.881
I'm here at the old house.

48:02.960 --> 48:06.169
- Fuck!
- Come here quick before they get to me.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.408
Go straight to Rex.

48:18.920 --> 48:20.410
He's there right now.

48:29.680 --> 48:30.966
Wake up. Time to go.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.569
That's why I retired early.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.968
This business pays well.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.605
When they ask for a hit...

49:18.120 --> 49:19.645
we use prisoners.

49:21.680 --> 49:24.047
We bring them out to kill the target...

49:25.840 --> 49:27.524
then we bring them back inside.

49:28.840 --> 49:31.525
No one will ever suspect them.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.924
It's not only one group.

49:36.280 --> 49:37.122
There's a lot.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.126
There's one in Bicutan...

49:40.920 --> 49:42.365
one in Bulacan.

49:43.840 --> 49:45.569
There's also one in Pampanga.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.723
The people inside take care...

49:49.520 --> 49:51.249
of bringing them in and out.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.122
Money runs everyone.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.850
That's not new.

50:02.840 --> 50:05.366
What I don't understand is...

50:07.560 --> 50:09.005
how come you got involved?

50:12.920 --> 50:13.967
Also...

50:14.160 --> 50:16.731
<i>where does Johnny Tm come 'm'?</i>

50:18.880 --> 50:20.245
He's my boss.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.248
If there's a job, he calls me.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.209
I talk to my middleman.

50:27.920 --> 50:30.048
And the middleman handles the prisoners.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.646
The pay goes straight to the middleman.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.769
Before Johnny died..

50:39.240 --> 50:41.004
Jobs stopped coming in.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.328
Who killed him?

50:57.160 --> 50:59.811
They were being liquidated one by one.

51:00.280 --> 51:01.850
Someone was killed before him.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.842
He was afraid that he was next.

51:04.200 --> 51:08.171
All of General's contacts were being silenced.

51:08.760 --> 51:10.444
- Which General?
- Pacheco.

51:10.760 --> 51:11.921
Fuck!

51:13.680 --> 51:17.082
Are you sure?

51:17.720 --> 51:19.370
He's running for Senate!

51:20.880 --> 51:23.690
Johnny has all of his cards.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.450
You have to find it.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.365
I need protection.

51:38.080 --> 51:41.687
Linda... she's gone now.

51:43.680 --> 51:46.286
I'm transferring you.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.170
You're not safe here.

51:49.800 --> 51:51.370
I'll just get the car.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.443
I'll come back for you.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.408
There's a party at Julius' later.

52:41.560 --> 52:43.005
Let's drop by.

53:48.960 --> 53:50.928
I need phone credit.

53:51.240 --> 53:52.651
Fifty pesos worth.

54:04.120 --> 54:05.121
What are you doing here?

54:05.200 --> 54:06.884
Why? Is it illegal?

54:08.080 --> 54:09.366
What's going on?

54:09.680 --> 54:11.808
Do you still have my number?

54:13.120 --> 54:14.724
Why is it taking so long?

54:32.360 --> 54:34.203
Fuck! That's Pol!

54:39.720 --> 54:41.165
Finish it!

54:50.200 --> 54:51.247
Fuck!

54:51.320 --> 54:52.685
What happened?

54:56.880 --> 54:58.120
Police!

54:58.200 --> 54:59.531
Run!

55:13.120 --> 55:14.451
Stop!

55:15.520 --> 55:16.407
Stop!

55:19.760 --> 55:22.525
Sir, we'll take care of it!

55:35.800 --> 55:37.131
I didn't get him.

55:37.680 --> 55:39.887
He's alive! Let's bring him to the hospital!

55:42.240 --> 55:43.924
Hang on, Pol!

55:46.760 --> 55:48.762
Don't go to sleep!

56:00.760 --> 56:02.205
The target's alive.

56:02.200 --> 56:03.884
You didn't finish him off.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.929
Fix this.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.850
It won't do.

56:27.840 --> 56:29.365
You fucked up!

56:29.600 --> 56:31.841
Start calling up hospitals!

56:32.040 --> 56:33.883
I'll finish this!

56:37.920 --> 56:39.445
If you informed me about the lead...

56:39.520 --> 56:41.329
we could've protected him.

56:42.200 --> 56:43.884
He only trusted me.

56:44.520 --> 56:45.681
We had an understanding.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.245
Come here.

56:49.520 --> 56:51.443
You're messing up my case.

56:52.120 --> 56:54.043
I don't care if you don't like me.

56:54.200 --> 56:55.964
Just stay out of this!

56:59.040 --> 57:02.010
Isn't Pacheco a party-mate of your father-in-law?

57:02.160 --> 57:03.924
What are you trying to say?

57:04.400 --> 57:05.811
Tell me straight to my face!

57:07.680 --> 57:08.966
This is now personal.

57:09.080 --> 57:10.411
Whether you like it or not...

57:10.680 --> 57:12.250
I'll work on the case.

57:18.800 --> 57:22.282
I need to see those books I turned over.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.005
The ones that belonged to Tiu.

57:25.040 --> 57:26.610
This isn't your case anymore.

59:03.400 --> 59:07.041
If we don't have evidence against Pacheco...

59:07.040 --> 59:10.647
his identity remains within the three of us.

59:10.840 --> 59:12.046
I'll just check something.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.369
Move!

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.606
Out of the way!

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.645
Move!

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.124
I'll find you a doctor.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.800
Out of the way!

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.450
Out of the way!

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.080
Stop!

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.446
Cut him off!

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.404
Everyone, down on the ground!

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.010
Get out of here!

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.806
Bernabe!

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.050
I'm fine!

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.161
Fuck!

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.844
Nobody move! NBI!

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.087
Next station, Cubao.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.400
Freeze!

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.765
Move aside!

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.525
Out of the car now!

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.368
Out of the fucking car!

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.290
In different public schools...

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.363
that will be used as precincts in this...

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.442
upcoming local elections.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.888
- You're not allowed here.
- We have already contacted the different...

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.368
- I said you can't be here!
- zone officials to secure key positions...

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.921
Later Francis.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.769
We need to talk, now.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.001
Confinue.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.691
Okay. Yes sir. To continue...

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.923
we are going to contact the different...

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.405
zone officials...

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.641
to secure key positions for our...

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.889
volunteers and watchers during election day.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.049
We will also have the support...

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.202
of both the Catholic Women's League...

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.243
Pol was killed earlier.
and the different Rotary and Lions'Clubs...

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.521
Do you know who he is?

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.721
Who?

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:09.842
What's the problem?

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.285
Do you know him?

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.289
Is it important that we do?

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.163
He spoke before he died.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.368
Local knows Pacheco's involvement.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.524
Why didn't you tell me about this?

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.447
Local will join the investigation.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.207
This will be all over the news tomorrow.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.609
Is the President involved?

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.004
It doesn't have to go that far.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.006
- That's if...
- Don't involve me in this mess.

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.050
This is as far as I go.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.845
What did you think you were doing here, Francis?

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.288
You knew where this was going.

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:47.970
So don't act like an idiot.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.089
I trusted you because I respected you.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.210
And this is what I get in return?

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:55.084
You're involving me in your mess?

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.685
You're involved whether you like it or not.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.970
Ever since you became associated with Nicky.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.251
- Ever since you became family.
- Don't involve Nicky in this.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.361
What will you do...

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.283
if I don't play your game?

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.121
Will you have me killed just like Pol?

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.323
It wasn't me!

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.764
Freddie, go inside.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.649
Okay, here.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.604
Come on.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.801
Okay.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.843
Pacheco's business is to have people killed.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:53.442
I told him to stop it...

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.090
especially now that he's running
for a government position.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.364
Why do you protect him?

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.082
I can arrest him right now.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.408
I was a client of his once.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.200
Maybe...

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.805
twice.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.769
If you arrest him...

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.802
it will be the end of me.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.411
And you.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.890
How could you do that?

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.644
I considered everything.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.644
He was my last resort.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.965
But you had it done twice.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.608
You won't understand unless
you're walking in my shoes.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.611
Francis!

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.886
Francis!

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.251
Make his eyebrows thicker.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.129
There, right.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.411
Add more facial hair.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.765
His cheeks are thinner than that.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.241
What happened? Dad called.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.125
What did he tell you?

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.966
Well...

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.844
he didn't sound okay.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.890
He said that you two should talk.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.530
I can't help him anymore.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.763
Whatever his problem is, it's his fault.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.444
How can you say that?

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.442
Can't you do him a small favor?

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.170
Favor?

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.125
Do you know what he's asking from me?

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.767
Come on. It's as if he's asking
you to do something illegal.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.888
Dad won't let anything bad happen to you.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.166
That's what I thought!

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.525
What are you saying?

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.403
No one's clean in this line of work.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.561
Everyone's the same.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.562
Your dad will drag us down with him!

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.567
Are you really that naive?

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.289
We're both naive.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.364
You, when it comes to politics.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.290
And me, when it comes to you.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.282
Did I ever judge your father for what he did?

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.564
What are you asking of me?

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.846
Do I really need to ask?

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.287
When dad had my mom's murderer killed...

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.242
I didn't have to ask.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.410
But he did it quietly for our peace of mind.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.366
How about you?

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.170
What are you gonna do for mine?

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.085
Hello?

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:02.810
Who's this?

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.040
Diana...

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.846
Who's this?

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.970
Have you forgotten about me?

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.041
Daniel?

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.608
Why do you always go home alone?

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.169
Don't you know it's dangerous at night?

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.760
How are you?

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.245
When did you get back?

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.644
Is it true you were in Dubai?

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.087
So you still know everything about me.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.289
Not really.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.731
Your mom told me.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.723
Do you remember what I told you?

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.847
That I'd come back for you?

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.325
When are you going back to Dubai?

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.885
I found a job here.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.123
I still have to travel, but only to Cebu.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.243
So that I'm closer to you.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.329
Don"t Na)'-

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.763
I don't want to waste any more time.

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.282
We already lost six years.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.528
Let's not delay this any longer.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:34.569
Let's get back together.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.607
What happened to you?

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.404
Please take it slow.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.005
Sorry...

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.964
I can't help myself.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.044
What's that?

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.649
I don't know.

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.406
I'm still figuring it out.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.562
But, you know?

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.886
If I get good at this...

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.281
I'll make one for your baby.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.370
Wishful thinking.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.840
Nick...

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.243
He's coming out in a while, okay?

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.210
Please? Just talk to him.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.445
Reschedule it.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.925
I'm not available.

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.929
Call up Reyes.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.002
Don't let Nicky worry again.

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.687
Join me for breakfast.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.088
She's still asleep. Don't bother her.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.805
Why is the door locked?

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.003
What time did her boyfriend leave?

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.769
As soon as he dropped her off.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.206
Open the door.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.528
- Come on Mario.
- Why didn't you answer?

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.725
Why are you here?

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.730
You slept over?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.286
Answer me!

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.244
Did you sleep over?

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.807
What are you doing here in my house?

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.127
What do you care if he slept over?

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.564
Get out of here!

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.841
Just leave.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.650
You're rarely home and you embarrass her?

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.644
Who do you think you are? You have no right
over us just because you give s money!

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.251
Put it on my tab, I don't have change.

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.242
I have change here.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.968
I left my wallet in the car. Later!

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.850
Sir, please pay for the banana stick.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.324
You're just leaving your car here?

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.687
Your office mates might steal it.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.402
Sir, your payment please.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.803
Can I borrow twenty pesos?

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.089
I'll pay you back later.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.807
These one, eight months ago in Caloocan.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.363
Then six months ago in Muntinlupa.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.000
Three weeks ago.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.890
All of them were killed...

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.171
to remove connections to the General.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.323
Now all the high-profile contractors...

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.921
are safe.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.287
Smart, right?

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.526
So in short...

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.723
all of our possible witnesses are dead.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.282
That's why we need to catch the two from last night.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.885
Then their middleman.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.165
Then the middleman's boss...

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.049
until we can find evidence against the mastermind.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.929
What if we don't find them?

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.446
Oh, right.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.968
Why don't you ask your father-in-law?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.002
They all have the same M.O.

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.806
All professional hits.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.251
Especially these two.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.606
They were your father-in-law's opponents.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.442
This one...

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.001
was caught in the ambush of his wife, the mayor.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.164
That's easy to say, Acosta.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.804
But we don't have anything substantial.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.891
Everything is in the ledgers...

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.970
the ledgers that are missing.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.600
I had them find it.

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.205
They're in the other room.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.565
I already went through all of them.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.609
They just contained Tiu's drug transactions.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.240
That can't be.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.930
Pol said...

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.730
Tiu had evidence against them.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.771
I'm sure it's in there somewhere.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.528
Where are they?

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.282
Come with me.

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.964
I'll go through them myself.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.723
The authorities suspect that...

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.087
the two men were hired assassins.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.808
Here's the cartographic sketch...

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.928
You look like the guy I'm watching on TV.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.370
I said, you look like the guy I'm watching on TV.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.646
You look like the gunman.

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.046
How come?

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.441
I don't know. You were here right?

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.241
How did that happen when I'm locked up here.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.851
I don't know!

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:12.571
Come here. I need to talk to you.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.042
Sir, I sprained my ankle.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.406
Not you, Daniel!

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.124
Come quick!

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:18.883
Me?

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.769
Yes you! Now!

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.364
Let's talk over there.

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.520
I don't like the dark.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.044
Do this first.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.367
Tell handsome I said thanks.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.330
What took you so long?

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.290
Where's Daniel?

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.090
Rex needed to see me.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.565
You can go now.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.770
Hey, jerk! Don't forget about later.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.560
Give me a massage.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.331
How are you?

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.440
What?

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.328
Still not feeling well?

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.083
What did Rex tell you?

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.291
He wants me to make a table
for his kid's birthday.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.166
It's true.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.089
That's all he said!

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.160
Takeit

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.210
Come on.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.088
Believe me!

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.649
That's all he said!

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.407
I won't do everything for this job.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.847
After all that you've done for me?

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.768
I see you as my father.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.203
Eat something, okay?

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.011
Later.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.282
So, what'd you fuck up?

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.521
Why are you still a sergeant now?

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.243
It was my boss who screwed up.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.049
He was a corrupt motherfucker.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.771
Now he's in jail...

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.970
and I got demoted for bringing him here.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.044
But that's okay.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.563
I get to sleep soundly at night.

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:19.083
While they have nightmares.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.962
They don't get nightmares.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.726
They're used to it.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.001
That's what pisses me off.

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:30.405
Even their conscience sides with them.

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.449
But your dad was different.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.449
Even if it was already too late...

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.409
he still tried to change.

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.770
What did you say?

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.041
Haven't you heard the stories?

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.731
Don't believe the rumors.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.566
They were just trying to honor a dead man.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.971
I don't know.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.931
But, according to one story...

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.922
they cornered him...

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.004
and made it seem like he was fleeing the country.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.731
So he was killed.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.208
But, the truth is that...

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:05.727
he was about to rat on his colleagues.

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:09.726
Problem was, the higher ups got wind of it.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.763
Sir, we have a new lead!

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.049
You have a visitor.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.604
Mario Maghari.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:25:00.807
SP01 Acosta of the Tondo Police. Answer his
questions properly, and we'll have no problem.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.531
Good evening.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.968
Are you Mrs. Maghari?

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.408
Yes? What is this about?

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.885
<i>Atty. Hands Corona...</i>

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.246
NBI

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.641
This is regarding your husband.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:32.888
Did something bad happen to him?

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.531
This is my friend...

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:35.562
ﬂ.Bh@Y-

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.246
He's fixing something in the sink.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.010
Please fix the sink upstairs first.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.684
I have a visitor.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.121
Do you remember me?

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.805
Sir?

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.808
You gave me a hard time the other night.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.605
I couldn't catch my breath.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.684
It's been a while since I had exercise.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.371
What's this about?

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.563
This is about Johnny Tiu...

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.690
about Pol.

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.529
And probably a whole lot more.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.644
How many have you killed?

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.281
I've been locked up for thirteen years.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.082
Even if I want to get out...

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.691
it's not possible.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.126
My partner's at your house right now.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.567
We separated then...

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.608
for about three years?

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.806
I got tired because he didn't have a job.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.087
He worked part time at the construction site.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.401
It just wasn't enough for us.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.006
I just heard that he was imprisoned.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.042
He killed his foreman for cutting down his pay.

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:55.286
So you got back together when he was in prison?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.570
Is that right?

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.803
In a way, yes.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:06.684
When did you last see each other?

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.525
Wait a minute. When was that?

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.889
I visited him last month.

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.366
The tip we got isn't true then?

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.121
That he often comes home?

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.209
What? No, it isn't true.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:32.164
Our neighbors love to gossip.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.050
Don't believe a word they say.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.200
Maybe it's my other friend who looks like Mario.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.123
I think they're referring to him.

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.930
Would you like some water?

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.726
Go to your room. I have a visitor.

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:58.601
We know what your husband does in jail.

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.887
We need your cooperation.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.366
You're paying for your daughter's Law school.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.564
You get paid that much?

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.804
Do YOU pay taxes?

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.724
Pol told me everything.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.124
Remember him?

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.368
Are you sure you don't know anything?

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.324
Is there something...

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.602
you want to tell me?

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.649
Whoever is bringing you in and out of here...

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:45.569
is probably talking to your
middleman right now.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.445
When I leave...

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.690
you're dead meat.

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.241
I really don't know what you're talking about.

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.410
You son of a bitch!

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.403
Hello?

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.170
No one wants to talk.

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:31.091
Your friend Bhoy is over at your place.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.248
I don't have any friend named Bhoy.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.243
From what I gather...

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:43.730
it seems he's good at fixing
your wife's plumbing.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.569
I meant the sink's.

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.764
How is your foot?

01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.210
I see it's still swollen.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:04.084
Your wife already replaced you.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.123
And your life is in danger.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.884
If I were you...

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.129
I would save myself while I still can.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.970
People like you...

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.363
should just be shot in the head.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.965
You're all scum.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.725
Scum!

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:29.565
That fuck!

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.201
That fucker!

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.010
Let's tell Thelma! What do you say?

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.523
I wasn't even respected.

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.331
Police are all cock suckers.

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.723
Just because they have a badge.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.562
Fuck 'em!

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.648
I accepted this job for her...

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.764
so that she'd come back to me.

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.962
But she just humiliates me like this!

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.131
Fuck!

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.771
What do you want to discuss with me?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.688
Do you know anything about my father's death?

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.402
That is classified information.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.289
Did you kill my father?

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:33.568
You make it sound so personal Francis.
But it was a decision made by us, to save the country.

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:34.926
Literally.

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.451
Don't be stupid.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.170
Put that away.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:47.361
Put that away. This is not the time
for you to have your revenge, boy.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:52.445
The time will come, if you just use your head.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.685
Now that you're inside...

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.844
roll with it.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.964
Do you think the president and the lawmakers...

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.724
are running this country?

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.643
If the police and the military didn't exist...

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:08.086
democracy would've been long gone.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.771
No.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.206
We are running this country.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.246
Join us.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:26.800
And maybe... one day you'll have your revenge,
Atty. Francis Coronel Jr.

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.964
Take care of your wife for me.

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.531
What happened?

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.605
She's okay Fran.

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.607
If she didn't have spotting...

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.922
we wouldn't have known that she's pregnant.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.762
We're both having our first born then.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.250
Hello?

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.169
This is your papa.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.171
Pa...

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.525
How are you?

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.845
Your mom?

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.210
She's not here.

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.726
How are you?

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.083
What's new?

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.528
I was able to get off work for awhile.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.523
I've known for quite a while now.

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.731
You don't have to worry about me.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.085
I'm old enough.

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.771
Take care of yourself.

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.323
- You're late.
- Sorry, something came up.

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:43.647
Let's go.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.210
No smoking inside.

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.803
We're the only ones that know about Tiu's father.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.724
My informant contacted me earlier.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.405
He's ready to help out with the case.

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:56.250
But he's scared.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.651
What does he have?

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.921
I don't know.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.166
Whatever it is...

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.009
I'm sure it's important.

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.522
He wouldn't be scared otherwise, right?

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:09.088
This is Pol's payback, finally.

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.362
We'll get that son of a bitch, Pacheco.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.965
Pull over first. I need to pee.

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.523
Actually Charlie wanted to talk tomorrow.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.969
But I said why not tonight?

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.809
Tomorrow when we wake up...

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:33.288
Pacheco might already be our President.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:36.451
I need to do something!

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.923
Fuck!

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.802
We already know about it Francis.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.169
What's the update Herman?

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:12.650
I just don't know where exactly.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.530
That's fine.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.287
Ben's on his way to Charlie.

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.051
Hello?

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.241
Good.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.084
The policeman?

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.962
He's lucky.

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.283
It's not his time.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:41.729
Laptop, desktop, records...

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:43.570
you know the drill.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.887
The policeman didn't make it in time.

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.366
And Tiu's father?

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.889
He's quiet now.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.723
You did the right thing, Francis.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.770
What did I tell you?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.651
Youngest NBI Chief? Or youngest Senator?

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.049
Good job, Francis.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:07.090
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:35.601
It's done.

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.768
Ben's on his way to Charlie.

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:09.763
Warden's orders! He needs help moving stuff.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.650
Not you.

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:14.921
Just him.

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.411
Let's go.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.370
Let's go!

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.284
Which one?

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.610
Don't go.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.845
What?

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:56.122
Dad's expecting us.

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:58.521
We told him we were joining them.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.928
Something big is going to happen.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.170
I'm sorry.

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.887
General Pacheco's going down.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.130
I'm sorry but I have to do my job.

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.089
Everyone involved will soon be exposed.

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:42.288
Nick...

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.286
I'm sorry.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.286
Daniel, you'll be replacing Tatang.

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.045
You can do it.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.290
What will happen to Tatang?

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.922
We can't use him anymore.

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:16.803
Are you going to have him killed?

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.770
Forget about him.

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.129
He'll be a free man in two days.

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:44.005
Acosta, where are you? I'm near the office.

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.686
Fuck.

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.285
If you didn't leave me last night...

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.520
Tiu's father would still be alive!

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:51.451
You have a lot of explaining to do.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:54.524
Acosta, pay attention! This is important!

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.802
I have evidence against the General.

01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:59.169
It will also incriminate my father-in-law.

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.680
Oh fuck.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.771
I'm near.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.405
There's no turning back from here.

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.408
They'll meet up at the General's office.

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:11.643
We'll arrest them there.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.401
Sir!

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.249
If you got solid evidence...

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.369
I'll treat you to a banana stick.

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.927
But wait.

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.324
What about your Range Rover?

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.569
I'm back to my old Honda.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.600
Fuck!

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.129
Get out of my way!

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.165
Francis!

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:17.725
Call an ambulance!

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.564
The ambulance is on its way!

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.246
Hold on!

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.730
You can do it.

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.003
Get the ambulance here!

01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.810
Fuck!

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:46.125
Motherfuckers!

01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.642
Fuck!

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.245
Motherfuckers!

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:09.840
Noted.

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.803
This is not right.

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:27.288
We can never hold him by the neck. It's better
to have him killed while he's powerless.

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:42.647
Pull over!

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:43.926
You fucking murderers!

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:47.326
Who do you think you are? Gods?

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:49.881
Bravo! Bravo!

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.007
Block that car!

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.411
What's going on?

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:55.085
Nobody touches him.

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:56.321
Everyone, stand down.

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:59.011
Pull over!

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.924
Get out of the car!

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.723
Fuckers! Get out!

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.644
I said stand down!

01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:26.085
Stop shooting!

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:31.764
Stop shooting!

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:36.242
Stop shooting!

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:58.325
Do you mind sending this to my kid?

01:43:58.440 --> 01:43:59.680
The address is right there.

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.444
Sure, just place it on top.

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.649
Thank you and take care!

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:08.522
Here you go.

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:11.530
Your last meal here should be special.
Have an extra egg.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:13.368
Congratulations!

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.771
Thanks.

01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:00.282
You got a lot of stuff here.

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.643
Why did you accept everything?

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:05.690
Just leave them there.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:09.726
You'll have a hard time tomorrow.

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.681
Do you think...

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.406
Rex would allow Diana to live here with me?

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.205
Does she know?

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:32.129
I want to tell her soon.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.403
This isn't the place to start a family.

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:46.169
What do you plan to do when you get out?

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.009
I don't have anywhere to go.

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.202
You'll fix it once you see each other.

01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.129
I'm Old.

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:02.682
It's hard to start again.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:16.002
'Tang, I still haven't thanked you...

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:19.690
for everything.

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.842
If not for you...

01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.687
I wouldn't have survived here this long.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.804
I'll never forget you.

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.570
I'm sure of that.

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.523
'Tang, WW?

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:31.404
We don't want to comment.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.365
Please respect our privacy.

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.886
Of my family and also my daughter's.

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:40.441
We are going through
a very difficult time right now.

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.363
The lone gunman identified as...

01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:44.044
Sergeant Joaquin Acosta...

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.923
was immediately relieved of his duties...

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.524
pending investigation.

01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:49.449
Witness accounts say that Acosta...

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.885
chased Pacheco's entourage...

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.211
before the shooting rampage occurred.

01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.247
That's how it is, fucked up.

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.368
No more comments from my client.

01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.562
We're ready to face any investigation.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:13.125
Babe, I used up all the water.

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.767
You son of a bitch!

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.286
Bhoy!

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:49.121
Fuck you! I hope you die!
