I don't feel the way I'm supposed to feel.

I just don't understand Christmas,

05:09.293 --> 05:11.544
...the mere fact
that you realize you need help...

05:11.712 --> 05:13.963

we can label it.

If you are, then you have hypengyophobia.

Are you afraid of staircases?
If you are, then you have climacophobia.

Maybe you have thalassophobia.
This is fear of the ocean.

Or gephyrophobia,
which is the fear of crossing bridges.

05:44.578 --> 05:48.497
Or maybe you have pantophobia.
Do you think you have pantophobia?
