WEBVTT

00:04.208 --> 00:08.458
'80s soft rock playing

00:09.458 --> 00:12.709
shuts off shower

00:48.291 --> 00:50.000
knock on door

01:35.667 --> 01:37.083
What's up?

01:37.166 --> 01:38.667
You know Lindsey Dunlay?

01:38.750 --> 01:39.667
No.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.333
Court-appointed
child psychologist.

01:41.417 --> 01:42.750
I went to high
school with her.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.000
Oh, yeah?
What she want with us?

01:44.083 --> 01:45.333
Case of hers--

01:45.417 --> 01:46.959
Sean Morgan was arrested
for a strong-arm.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.625
Judge sent him to
Lindsey for evaluation.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.291
And?

01:50.375 --> 01:52.917
When he was three,
Sean witnessed his
mother's murder.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.375
The case was never solved.

01:54.458 --> 01:55.208
Lil!

01:55.291 --> 01:56.375
Hey, Lindsey.
Hey.

01:56.458 --> 01:57.625
This is my partner
Scotty Valens.

01:57.709 --> 01:58.959
How you doing?
Hey. Good.

01:59.041 --> 02:00.875
So, uh, what was she
like in high school?

02:00.959 --> 02:02.417
She'll never tell, right?

02:02.500 --> 02:05.166
Let's just say Lilly and I
never made the year book.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.250
chuckles

02:06.333 --> 02:08.542
The holy terror
is over there.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.041
What's his deal?

02:10.125 --> 02:12.458
17-year-old thug
in the making.

02:13.583 --> 02:17.500
RUSH:
Sean came up in foster care?

02:17.583 --> 02:18.875
I'm hoping the judge
goes easy,

02:18.959 --> 02:21.041
'cause in another year
he gets the big time.

02:21.125 --> 02:22.041
What was the robbery?

02:22.125 --> 02:24.208
Purse snatching off an LOL.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.959
Done two others just like it.

02:27.041 --> 02:28.333
He's next to hopeless.

02:28.417 --> 02:30.583
But it seems like
he has some real memories

02:30.667 --> 02:31.959
of his mom getting killed.

02:32.041 --> 02:32.959
That's why I called you.

02:33.041 --> 02:34.375
He never told anyone about it?

02:35.166 --> 02:36.750
No one that believed him.

02:41.375 --> 02:45.875
Sean, this is
Detective Rush who
I told you about.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.583
My partner
Detective Valens.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.959
Partners, huh?

02:49.041 --> 02:50.458
You hit that yet?

02:50.542 --> 02:53.917
I know I just misunderstood you,
Sean.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.417
I'm about to turn 18.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.792
If he don't man-up real soon,

02:56.875 --> 02:58.417
maybe you and I
could hook it up.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.083
Yeah, yeah,
I'll think about it.

03:00.166 --> 03:03.166
Sean, stop wasting their time
and tell them about your mom.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.667
RUSH:
Lindsey said you had
some specific memories

03:05.750 --> 03:07.125
about her being killed?

03:07.208 --> 03:09.542
I forgot 'em.

03:09.625 --> 03:11.750
So you like stealing
from old ladies, huh?
That's impressive.

03:11.834 --> 03:12.875
What do you know about it,
smalls?

03:12.959 --> 03:14.583
I know I got
better things to do

03:15.834 --> 03:17.875
than monkey with a kid
trying to get attention.

03:18.625 --> 03:19.875
Let's bounce.

03:22.500 --> 03:30.125
I'm sorry. I thought
this kid was different.

03:30.208 --> 03:31.667
What?

03:31.750 --> 03:33.625
You get ignored all the time,
right?

03:33.709 --> 03:35.083
Treated like what you say

03:35.166 --> 03:36.875
either ain't true
or worth crap.

03:36.959 --> 03:38.250
Yeah, that's about it.

03:38.333 --> 03:39.458
And here come
two people

03:39.542 --> 03:41.375
who want to listen
to what you have to say

03:41.458 --> 03:43.000
and you're letting us
walk away?

03:43.083 --> 03:46.125
You want your mom's case
looked at, we're your chance.

03:46.208 --> 03:50.375
And why should I believe you?

03:50.458 --> 03:53.959
Look at me.

03:54.041 --> 04:01.291
Am I lying?

04:01.375 --> 04:07.458
Red and yellow balloons.

04:07.542 --> 04:10.875
A train and the name "Bobby."

04:11.000 --> 04:17.667
That's what I remember
about her being murdered.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.125
A 30-year-old waitress,

04:53.208 --> 04:54.375
stabbed to death
in her rowhouse in Mayfair.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.625
No weapon recovered.

04:55.709 --> 04:57.458
Got some prints, hair,
but never a match.

04:57.542 --> 04:58.583
Lady was butchered real good.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.375
Gaping neck wound.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.792
VALENS:
three year old Sean sat
with her all night like that.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.583
No wonder he's a little s.o.b.

05:04.667 --> 05:05.542
Who found the body?

05:05.625 --> 05:08.375
Neighbor. Leon Kincaid.

05:08.458 --> 05:11.250
Up early for a jog, heard
the kid wailing, called 9-1-1.

05:11.333 --> 05:12.542
Suspects?

05:12.625 --> 05:14.083
She worked
as a cocktail waitress

05:14.166 --> 05:15.375
at a joint called Boilermakers.

05:15.458 --> 05:18.041
Ton of interviews
from there.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.166
Patrons, co-workers...
nothing stuck.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.875
Jeffries is running
the names again.

05:21.959 --> 05:24.125
Maybe 15 years later someone's
true colors have come through.

05:24.208 --> 05:26.750
Anything on Sean's father?

05:26.834 --> 05:28.667
The assigned's notebook says
he was never in the picture.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.583
No next of kin, landing Sean
in foster care...

05:31.667 --> 05:34.375
leaving us with
red and yellow balloons,

05:34.458 --> 05:36.041
a train and the name Bobby.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.917
Pretty modest
starting point.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.375
Any luck for us?

05:40.458 --> 05:43.750
Yeah. Your 9-1-1 caller,
Leon Kincaid,

05:43.834 --> 05:45.417
the guy's on the books.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.667
RUSH:
What'd he do?

05:47.750 --> 05:49.041
Well, starting in '91,

05:49.125 --> 05:51.500
been arrested for open lewdness,
loitering,

05:51.583 --> 05:54.417
and my personal favorite,
prowling at night.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.709
Any idea where Leon
hangs out these days?

05:57.792 --> 06:02.875
Yeah, he happens to be the top
man at Germantown Dorsett Bank.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.041
Leon Kincaid?

06:11.125 --> 06:13.166
Yeah?

06:13.250 --> 06:15.291
Detectives Rush and Valens.
Can we have a minute?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.625
Um... 0kay.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.458
I'll be right back, Jodie.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.083
This way.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.959
<i>About 6:00 a.m.</i>

06:22.041 --> 06:24.291
I'm out running and hear the kid
bawling his head off,

06:24.375 --> 06:25.542
so I go around the back

06:25.625 --> 06:29.542
and look in, and, uh...
it was just awful.

06:29.625 --> 06:30.917
Did you know Rebecca?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.750
Enough to say hello,
that's about it.

06:33.834 --> 06:36.166
Ever see anyone go in
or out of her house?

06:36.250 --> 06:37.291
Nah.

06:37.375 --> 06:40.250
Pretty girl, right?

06:40.333 --> 06:41.291
I guess.

06:41.375 --> 06:42.667
Ever ask her out?

06:42.750 --> 06:44.208
chuckles

06:44.291 --> 06:47.000
Like I said, we never
really spoke, so, uh...

06:47.083 --> 06:49.125
I'm sorry, I'm not much help.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.125
Uh, but I should get back.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.959
To Jodie?

06:53.041 --> 06:54.792
Pardon?

06:54.875 --> 06:56.625
Need to get back so he can
look over her shoulder,

06:56.709 --> 06:57.792
down her blouse.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.709
Busty girl.

06:59.792 --> 07:01.417
VALENS:
We know about you, Leon.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.959
We know you've
had your trouble

07:03.041 --> 07:04.291
with boundaries.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.000
I never hurt anyone.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.375
I never touched.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.959
Did my probation,
got counseling.

07:10.041 --> 07:11.500
Good for you.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.417
But in '89, you were
just getting revved up.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.750
Hey, Leon, you registered
as a sex offender?

07:16.834 --> 07:17.709
No, hell no.

07:17.792 --> 07:19.542
I never molested anyone.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.458
Still, maybe I'll talk to sex
crimes see what we can do

07:21.542 --> 07:22.959
about getting you
on the books.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.458
Yeah, 'cause this sheep
dresses up real good.

07:24.542 --> 07:26.709
Better get the word out.

07:26.792 --> 07:29.458
Oh, jeez, okay. Okay.

07:31.458 --> 07:34.709
I'd peep on Rebecca.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.959
Pretty regular?

07:37.041 --> 07:39.000
Yeah.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.083
How about the night she died?

07:41.166 --> 07:44.542
But I didn't kill her.

07:44.625 --> 07:51.750
doorbell rings

07:51.834 --> 07:53.709
Ned, is something wrong?

07:53.792 --> 07:56.208
I wanted to apologize
for earlier.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.000
You don't have
to say anything.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.250
Just...

07:59.333 --> 08:02.709
well, the ball's
in your court, okay?

08:02.792 --> 08:04.041
Okay. Thank you.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.291
One more thing.

08:09.458 --> 08:11.375
What's all this?

08:11.458 --> 08:14.041
For Sean, for his birthday.

08:14.125 --> 08:15.083
Hey, these are for you,
little man.

08:15.166 --> 08:16.250
There you go.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.750
Ned, don't give
him any gifts.

08:17.834 --> 08:21.417
Oh, every boy needs something
to open on his birthday.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.250
We have cake,
that's enough.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.500
Oh, here.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.583
This is going to be
just like the Pampers.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.834
Oh, no, no, no.
I take back what I said earlier.

08:27.917 --> 08:30.750
I've written everything down.
I'm going to write you a check.

08:30.834 --> 08:34.166
What, so it can bounce?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.959
Here you go.

08:43.834 --> 08:45.542
Red and yellow balloons.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.458
Like Sean remembered.

08:47.542 --> 08:49.083
So, Leon,
that's all you saw?

08:49.166 --> 08:51.542
I wasn't exactly pumped
to stick around

08:51.625 --> 08:53.583
for a three-year-old's
birthday party.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.250
Right.
No girl coming out of cake.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.417
What's the upside for the
guy standing in the hedge?

08:57.500 --> 09:01.000
At least my move wasn't handing
out Pampers and balloons.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.542
This Ned guy's
a complete stooge.

09:08.041 --> 09:09.500
Ned Ryan.
The write-up here

09:09.583 --> 09:11.792
says you told the
assigned detective

09:11.875 --> 09:14.417
you hadn't seen
Rebecca in over a week.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.959
Been so long now.

09:16.041 --> 09:19.083
I couldn't tell you
when I talked to Rebecca last.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.041
Well, how about
the night she
was murdered?

09:21.125 --> 09:22.125
No.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.792
Ned, we know you
were at Rebecca's

09:23.875 --> 09:25.208
shortly before it happened.

09:25.291 --> 09:27.166
And you came bearing gifts;
balloons.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.500
So don't lie about it

09:28.583 --> 09:30.750
like you did
the first time around.

09:30.834 --> 09:34.250
Maybe... I was there.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.917
But I left after a few minutes.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.959
But you were angry,
right?

09:37.041 --> 09:38.709
So maybe you did
a U-turn.

09:38.792 --> 09:42.083
Yeah, 'cause you and Rebecca
fought earlier that day, too.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.542
Rebecca was a regular
at the store.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.709
I felt bad for her-- struggling
to support Sean on her own.

09:48.792 --> 09:50.417
You were giving her Pampers.

09:50.500 --> 09:54.750
Yes, I'd slip her Pampers,
baby food-- to cut her a break.

09:54.834 --> 09:56.959
Thanks so much, Ned.

09:57.041 --> 09:58.333
Not a problem.

09:58.417 --> 10:00.291
I just added another
shift at the tavern,

10:00.375 --> 10:02.667
so it won't be long
before I'm on my own
two feet.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.333
I wish you were working less
at that bar, not more.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.834
A woman like you
in such a filthy place...

10:07.917 --> 10:09.625
it's not right.

10:09.709 --> 10:13.417
Well, you're a doll, but it's a
real blessing to have more work.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.500
Thanks again, Ned.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.208
Oh, Ned...

10:18.291 --> 10:19.834
Oh, Ned, I'm sorry.

10:19.917 --> 10:23.625
I'm just not the kind of gal
who casually necks with a man.

10:23.709 --> 10:24.583
Rebecca,

10:24.667 --> 10:26.667
I didn't mean it like that.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.417
I would like to kiss you,

10:28.500 --> 10:32.291
because what I have to say
is anything but casual.

10:32.375 --> 10:33.709
But you barely know me.

10:33.792 --> 10:35.750
My folks dated one evening
at a county fair

10:35.834 --> 10:36.792
to know that they would

10:36.875 --> 10:38.750
spend the next
51 years together.

10:38.834 --> 10:39.667
Oh, Ned.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.333
You need a man in the house.

10:41.417 --> 10:42.625
A father figure to Sean.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.709
There's already a man
in my life.

10:45.792 --> 10:48.458
What?

10:48.542 --> 10:49.959
Who?

10:50.041 --> 10:51.542
And where is he?

10:51.625 --> 10:54.834
Well, he's from before--
back in Virginia.

10:54.917 --> 10:57.917
Well, how could he allow you
to be here alone?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.834
It's just all mixed up.

10:59.917 --> 11:00.875
It's upside-down.

11:00.959 --> 11:03.583
I'm sorry, Ned.

11:03.667 --> 11:09.083
This just isn't proper airing
these personal matters.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.917
I guess I would have
figured it all out
soon enough, huh?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.583
Yeah, Sean's three today.

11:13.667 --> 11:17.583
I guess he won't be needing
boxes and boxes and boxes

11:17.667 --> 11:23.750
of Pampers too much longer!

11:23.834 --> 11:25.875
VALENS:
So you felt rejected.

11:25.959 --> 11:30.625
No, no, no. I felt horrible
for blowing up like that.

11:30.709 --> 11:35.917
And that night, when I goofed
again, I left... for good.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.625
Where were you
the rest of the night?

11:37.709 --> 11:39.750
I lived in an apartment building
at the time.

11:39.834 --> 11:42.917
Whether anyone saw me, can vouch
for me, I wouldn't know.

11:43.000 --> 11:43.917
Okay, Ned.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.291
We'll look into it.

11:46.375 --> 11:51.333
I just wanted to find a gal like
my mother... from a better time.

11:51.417 --> 11:53.250
Rebecca was that girl.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.333
Ned's story checks out.

12:00.417 --> 12:02.083
An old coot
at the Tree Lane Apartments

12:02.166 --> 12:03.709
knew all about
his pining for Rebecca.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.792
What, he see him the
night of the murder?

12:05.875 --> 12:08.208
Coot says Ned was on his
balcony
for hours that night

12:08.291 --> 12:09.709
letting balloons go
one by one.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.750
Time to shift focus
to this man in her life.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.959
Well, maybe the man in
her life was Sean's dad.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.000
Maybe that was Bobby.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.125
Got something?

12:16.208 --> 12:17.750
Autotracked Rebecca Morgan

12:17.834 --> 12:20.417
looking for that connection
back in Virginia.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.834
Rebecca Morgan...

12:22.917 --> 12:25.417
died in 1982.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.959
Four years before Sean
was even born.

12:35.542 --> 12:37.583
Rebecca Morgan was
a 19-year-old freshman

12:37.667 --> 12:38.542
at Virginia.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.667
Died in a car crash
in 1982.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.709
So who was Sean's mom

12:40.792 --> 12:42.458
and why was she
using an alias?

12:42.542 --> 12:45.792
Woman goes into hiding, she's
usually running from abuse.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.333
Abuser could be the man
in her life.

12:47.417 --> 12:50.125
She told Ned she was in
a mixed-up relationship.

12:50.208 --> 12:51.417
"Upside down."

12:51.500 --> 12:52.834
Someone who
wasn't around.

12:52.917 --> 12:54.166
Maybe why he wasn't around.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.542
Brings us back to,
she was probably on the run.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.917
So let's figure out
who "she" is.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.792
Start with
the ME's office, Scotty.

13:00.875 --> 13:02.000
They should have

13:02.083 --> 13:04.083
her fingerprints to run
through AFIS.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.667
You get her name, buzz me.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.458
I'm going to go
see Sean.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.166
So how's Elisa?

13:10.250 --> 13:12.834
Good.
She liked meeting you.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.375
Coming to first Thursdays.

13:16.458 --> 13:20.750
She someone serious?

13:20.834 --> 13:23.959
We were engaged.

13:24.041 --> 13:25.041
Yeah.

13:25.125 --> 13:28.834
Before everything happened.

13:28.917 --> 13:32.375
Well, maybe
you'll get it back.

13:32.458 --> 13:41.792
I'm hoping.

13:41.875 --> 13:45.041
I'm not supposed to have
girls up here.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.375
It's my foster parent's rules.

13:47.458 --> 13:51.208
Sean, the red and yellow
balloons, they meant something.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.583
That's supposed to make
me feel better?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.875
Tell me more about the train,
and Bobby.

13:56.959 --> 13:58.750
I'm not even sure
the train was real.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.083
Maybe a toy train?

14:00.166 --> 14:03.083
No, it was a sketch,
a drawing or something.

14:03.166 --> 14:07.542
That's it, that's all I got.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.959
Sean, I think your mom
was running from someone.

14:10.041 --> 14:10.875
Yeah? Like who?

14:10.959 --> 14:12.250
I'm not sure.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.792
In fact, I'm not sure
who your mom was.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.875
Rebecca Morgan.

14:17.959 --> 14:20.000
No, that's the name
she was going by,

14:20.083 --> 14:21.792
but she was someone else.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.834
Soap opera city.

14:23.917 --> 14:26.250
She was trying
to get away
from something.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.041
Let me tell you
the 411, okay?

14:28.125 --> 14:29.917
Solve my mom's case or don't.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.709
'Cause I could give
a flying middle finger, okay?

14:33.792 --> 14:36.291
So why have Lindsey
contact me?

14:36.375 --> 14:38.125
'Cause I was bored.

14:38.208 --> 14:39.625
And now I'm bored again.

14:39.709 --> 14:41.750
You're not doing
it for me anymore.

14:41.834 --> 14:43.125
You're too pushy.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.125
So how about the hearing
you got coming up--

14:45.208 --> 14:45.834
that bore you, too?

14:45.917 --> 14:47.417
You're 17.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.125
The judge doesn't have to treat
you like a kid, you know?

14:50.208 --> 14:52.959
The judge can show up
with no drawers under his robe.

14:53.041 --> 14:55.083
He can also
kiss my ass.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.125
phone ringing

14:56.208 --> 15:00.041
That's a smart attitude.

15:00.125 --> 15:03.667
Rush.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.250
Yeah. Okay.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.875
Bye.

15:10.458 --> 15:13.041
Want to know
your mom's real name?

15:17.208 --> 15:19.375
No thanks.

15:26.583 --> 15:29.583
When did my daughter die?

15:29.667 --> 15:30.917
1989.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.667
Care for a drink?

15:34.750 --> 15:39.000
No, no, thank you.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.583
I'll be truthful.

15:40.667 --> 15:44.000
Having Linda was
the worst thing

15:44.083 --> 15:45.709
that ever happened to me.

15:45.792 --> 15:47.667
She was a bad kid?

15:47.750 --> 15:48.667
Not so bad.

15:48.750 --> 15:51.000
I just never
took to her.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.208
No matter how you slice it,

15:53.291 --> 15:56.000
for 18 years you lose your life.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.792
I knew I wasn't
maternal.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.208
Everyone kept saying,

16:00.291 --> 16:03.083
"When she pops out,
you'll feel different."

16:03.166 --> 16:06.333
Well, guess what?

16:06.417 --> 16:08.917
Miss Frandsen, do you remember
the last time you saw Linda?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.208
Guess the spring of '87.

16:11.291 --> 16:13.125
JEFFRIES:
What was the occasion?

16:13.208 --> 16:16.125
Vic.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.959
Her ex-husband.

16:18.041 --> 16:21.041
We weren't aware
she had a husband.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.959
Well, they didn't walk
down the aisle,

16:23.041 --> 16:25.041
but for all intents
and purposes...

16:25.125 --> 16:26.000
And so Linda showed up here?

16:26.083 --> 16:27.375
Unannounced.

16:27.458 --> 16:31.166
It'd been three years
since I last saw her.

16:31.250 --> 16:34.750
I wasn't even aware
she'd gotten pregnant.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.875
His name's Sean.

16:36.959 --> 16:39.375
Finally got your wish, huh?

16:39.458 --> 16:41.792
Yeah, and he's been so healthy.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.166
Happy to hear it.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.000
Why are you here?

16:44.083 --> 16:45.375
Vic's a freak.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.250
It's one thing if he wants
to punch on me,

16:47.333 --> 16:48.291
but I won't let him hurt Sean.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.333
Here we go.

16:49.417 --> 16:50.458
Here we go what?

16:50.542 --> 16:52.875
If he's as bad
as you claim he is,

16:52.959 --> 16:54.000
go to the police,

16:54.083 --> 16:55.125
get a restraining order.

16:55.208 --> 16:57.125
All that'll do
is help make for

16:57.208 --> 16:58.750
a tearjerker on
the 10:00 news.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.500
Sure that's not
the drama queen coming out?

17:00.583 --> 17:04.166
Don't you dare do that, Mama.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.417
So what?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.417
You don't want to go
to the police,

17:07.500 --> 17:09.083
what am I supposed to do?

17:09.166 --> 17:11.750
Let us stay here with you.

17:11.834 --> 17:13.750
One night,

17:13.834 --> 17:19.417
then we'll leave and I'll be
out of your hair forever.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.375
'80s rock playing

17:22.458 --> 17:24.917
Linda and Sean were
on the road early.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.333
JEFFRIES:
What about Vic?

17:26.417 --> 17:28.417
He ever come around?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.792
No. Didn't call either.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.792
I'm sure he didn't expect
me to know where she was.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.709
You never heard from
Linda again?

17:35.792 --> 17:36.709
Nope.

17:36.792 --> 17:39.125
I always figured they were

17:39.208 --> 17:43.291
still out there somewhere.

17:43.375 --> 17:45.625
VALENS:
Hey, Rocky...

17:45.709 --> 17:48.959
relax.

17:49.041 --> 17:50.667
How was she murdered?

17:50.750 --> 17:52.125
We'll get to that.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.792
Linda's mom says she was
on the run from you.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.208
Well, that's wrong.
I never met her mom.

17:57.291 --> 17:58.959
Not that I didn't want to.

17:59.041 --> 18:00.834
Linda wouldn't let that happen?

18:00.917 --> 18:02.291
She had a lot
of rules.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.917
She have one against marriage?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.667
She said a piece of paper's
what ruined things.

18:06.750 --> 18:07.750
I disagreed.

18:07.834 --> 18:09.166
So Linda keeps pulling

18:09.250 --> 18:11.333
that kind of nonsense,
why keep her around?

18:11.417 --> 18:14.333
'Cause my life
was different with her.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.667
Ton of smiles.

18:15.750 --> 18:18.083
Vic, you front like this
big, gentle giant,

18:18.166 --> 18:20.291
but you know what...
I don't buy it.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.333
'Cause we've been here
five minutes

18:22.417 --> 18:25.250
and not once have you asked
about your son.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.625
My son?

18:26.709 --> 18:28.166
Sean.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.917
Is that Linda's son?

18:30.000 --> 18:33.417
'Cause it
wasn't my son.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.458
Linda's only dream
was to have a baby.

18:35.542 --> 18:39.250
I couldn't give her one.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.750
Shooting blanks.

18:40.834 --> 18:44.208
Thanks for that.

18:44.291 --> 18:49.125
I failed her in the biggest way.

18:49.208 --> 18:52.166
What? Horse,
why you smiling?

18:52.250 --> 18:55.750
'Cause we're going
to get a pony.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.208
Vic, what?

18:57.291 --> 18:59.208
I went to the adoption
agency today--

18:59.291 --> 19:00.041
got us an appointment.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.208
Oh, no.

19:01.291 --> 19:03.417
I thought that'd
make you happy.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.166
They're not
going to approve
our application.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.000
You don't know.
Might get lucky.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.375
We're not going
to get lucky.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.375
You've been out of work
too long.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.125
That'll change.

19:13.208 --> 19:17.500
'Cause it is time
to play less and work more.

19:17.583 --> 19:21.625
Hey, we'll slow down.

19:21.709 --> 19:23.542
Better yet, we'll
get married.

19:23.625 --> 19:24.709
Huh?

19:24.792 --> 19:33.417
Yeah, it'll
increase our chances.

19:33.500 --> 19:39.542
Baby, what's wrong?

19:39.625 --> 19:43.750
I'm pregnant.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.458
I didn't think I could

19:46.542 --> 19:48.417
make that happen.

19:48.500 --> 19:52.583
It's not yours.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.917
Horse, I'm sorry.

19:55.000 --> 20:03.250
I'm so sorry.

20:03.333 --> 20:07.125
Tried talking to her,
I thought we could work it out.

20:07.208 --> 20:09.375
I come home one night
from job hunting,

20:09.458 --> 20:10.291
she was gone.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.208
And when was this?

20:12.291 --> 20:14.458
It was April in '85.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.333
You know who the father was?

20:16.417 --> 20:18.834
Found a name written down once.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.000
Had a hunch he was the guy.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.000
Any chance the name
was Bobby?

20:23.083 --> 20:24.333
No.

20:24.417 --> 20:26.333
Silver.

20:26.417 --> 20:27.333
Kyle...

20:27.417 --> 20:30.792
Silver.

20:30.875 --> 20:34.208
Not a period of my life
I was so proud of.

20:34.291 --> 20:36.166
RUSH:
No?

20:36.250 --> 20:38.208
I'm married 30 years.

20:38.291 --> 20:39.583
Linda was my one
transgression.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.125
My wife almost
divorced me.

20:41.208 --> 20:44.208
Pregnancy didn't go over
real big at home, huh?

20:44.291 --> 20:46.041
That part was never a problem.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.458
Linda had a miscarriage.

20:47.542 --> 20:49.834
Miscarriage?

20:49.917 --> 20:51.625
Caught the biggest break
of my life.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.583
I mean, an affair
is one thing, but...

20:53.667 --> 20:57.792
a second family--
that only plays in Utah.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.333
That was it then?

20:59.417 --> 21:02.500
As far as you know, Linda
moved on to someone else?

21:02.583 --> 21:04.709
I wouldn't say she went quietly.

21:04.792 --> 21:07.417
Nor was it easy
for me to say good-bye.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.792
Why not?

21:08.875 --> 21:12.500
Because this girl
was so sexy

21:12.583 --> 21:13.959
that it was silly.

21:14.041 --> 21:19.500
Kyle.

21:19.583 --> 21:22.458
What are you doing here?

21:22.542 --> 21:23.875
Let me put my tongue
in your mouth.

21:23.959 --> 21:25.375
Are you out of your mind?

21:25.458 --> 21:26.834
I asked you not
to come here.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.208
Everybody's looking at us.

21:28.291 --> 21:31.208
"Who's the piece with Silver?
Is he doing her?"

21:31.291 --> 21:33.542
You love it.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.083
Linda, this is
not the right way.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.208
That's too bad,

21:37.291 --> 21:38.750
'cause I'm not
giving up.

21:38.834 --> 21:40.834
What are you doing?
Come on.

21:40.917 --> 21:43.375
You know this is
how you want it.
Linda...

21:43.458 --> 21:44.375
Don't you?

21:44.458 --> 21:45.709
Don't you?

21:45.792 --> 21:47.792
Linda...

21:47.875 --> 21:55.583
Yes, yes, yes.

21:55.667 --> 21:58.125
I'm not giving
up, baby.

21:58.208 --> 22:00.542
I can't do it this way.

22:00.625 --> 22:03.166
I'm sorry.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.166
For the last time.

22:05.250 --> 22:14.375
This is all wrong.

22:14.458 --> 22:21.041
I walked back to my office
and never saw her again.

22:21.125 --> 22:24.083
And sexually speaking,
this is how Linda was?

22:24.166 --> 22:26.417
Overt like this?

22:26.500 --> 22:30.375
Well, I guess that makes
two secrets I've kept.

22:30.458 --> 22:32.959
I mean, if my wife knew
the particulars,

22:33.041 --> 22:35.250
she never would have
forgiven me.

22:35.333 --> 22:40.000
Hospital records confirm,
Linda had a miscarriage
September '85.

22:40.083 --> 22:42.250
Sean was born October '86.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.083
She had to have
gotten pregnant fast.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.500
Well, after hearing
Silver's account of Linda

22:46.583 --> 22:48.291
that would have taken
her all of an hour.

22:48.375 --> 22:51.500
Question is, do you believe
Silver's version of Linda

22:51.583 --> 22:52.750
or ex-husband Vic's?

22:52.834 --> 22:53.709
Or Neds?

22:53.792 --> 22:55.417
Mm. Three different girls.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.750
Or three girls in one.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.166
There she is--

22:59.250 --> 23:01.500
best and brightest physician
in all of Philadelphia.

23:01.583 --> 23:02.792
Shut up, Vailens.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.250
It's Valens. V-a-l-e-n-s.

23:04.333 --> 23:06.542
Hey, Frannie. Thanks
for coming so late.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.583
What else am I doing
at 10:00 at night?

23:08.667 --> 23:10.166
Our victim had a miscarriage

23:10.250 --> 23:12.667
shortly before getting
pregnant a second time.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.500
Yeah, we're determining
a timeline

23:14.583 --> 23:16.917
for when the actual roo-roo
took place.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.166
This is Rebecca Morgan,
now Linda Frandsen case?

23:20.250 --> 23:22.458
No. According
to the autopsy,

23:22.542 --> 23:23.917
there's no indication
of striations

23:24.000 --> 23:25.792
in the bone structure
of her pelvis.

23:25.875 --> 23:26.792
Come again?

23:26.875 --> 23:34.667
Your victim
never gave birth at all.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.667
Sean wasn't hers.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.375
She was in no position
to adopt.

23:41.458 --> 23:43.500
We contact the Center
For Missing and Abused
Children?

23:43.583 --> 23:44.333
Ran a search

23:44.417 --> 23:45.959
on abducted children

23:46.041 --> 23:48.208
in the Virginia/mid-Atlantic
states, '85 to '89.

23:48.291 --> 23:49.667
Two possible matches:

23:49.750 --> 23:52.333
John Barrett of Aberdeen
Maryland, Robert Gordon,

23:52.417 --> 23:53.333
Richmond, Virgina.

23:53.417 --> 23:55.750
Yeah.
Robert?

23:55.834 --> 23:56.959
Bobby.

23:57.041 --> 23:58.709
Gordons could be Sean's
real parents.

23:58.792 --> 23:59.792
Don't float that
till you're sure,
Scotty.

23:59.875 --> 24:01.208
I'll contact Virginia.

24:01.291 --> 24:02.792
They'll have
the Gordon's
DNA on file.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.667
I'll call over and get Sean
to get a DNA swab,

24:04.750 --> 24:06.000
say it's part
of the investigation.

24:06.083 --> 24:08.417
As soon as you get a match,
head south.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.834
WOMAN:
<i>So you say Bobby's</i>

24:10.917 --> 24:12.792
been in several foster homes?

24:12.875 --> 24:15.041
Moved a lot.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.125
He's had it rough.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.333
Been arrested?

24:17.417 --> 24:18.875
Jeff, don't assume that.

24:18.959 --> 24:21.125
A bunch of foster homes--
come on.

24:21.208 --> 24:23.291
Am I right?

24:23.375 --> 24:25.041
Several times.

24:25.125 --> 24:27.750
For what?

24:27.834 --> 24:28.875
Assaults, theft.

24:28.959 --> 24:30.208
But so far,
the juvenile courts

24:30.291 --> 24:32.041
have bailed him out.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.667
Mr. And Mrs. Gordon,

24:33.750 --> 24:36.250
ever known someone
named Linda Frandsen?

24:36.333 --> 24:38.625
She the one who took our boy?

24:38.709 --> 24:40.291
Frandsen? Wasn't that
what's-his-name ex-wife,

24:40.375 --> 24:41.333
the landscaper?

24:41.417 --> 24:42.667
Hector?

24:42.750 --> 24:44.041
Victor.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.333
Lake?

24:45.417 --> 24:47.792
Yeah.

24:47.875 --> 24:59.667
Linda came by with him once.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.083
What a sweetie!

25:01.166 --> 25:02.333
How old is he?

25:02.417 --> 25:03.417
Ten months.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.500
What's his name?

25:06.583 --> 25:08.500
Bobby.

25:08.583 --> 25:09.917
Bobby!

25:10.000 --> 25:12.083
You're just a little miracle,
aren't you, Bobby?

25:12.166 --> 25:13.458
That's what I tell myself

25:13.542 --> 25:17.250
as I'm combing the Cheerios
out of my hair.

25:17.333 --> 25:18.333
Can I tell you a secret?

25:18.417 --> 25:19.291
Sure.

25:19.375 --> 25:20.250
I'm expecting.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.125
That's wonderful.

25:22.208 --> 25:29.125
I think it's a boy.

25:29.208 --> 25:32.542
She seemed lovely.

25:32.625 --> 25:35.375
They came off decent enough.

25:35.458 --> 25:37.083
Yeah, we know Vic.

25:37.166 --> 25:38.750
When can we see Bobby?

25:38.834 --> 25:41.000
He goes by "Sean" now.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.375
And he doesn't know
about you yet,

25:43.458 --> 25:45.667
but Child Services
will be in touch

25:45.750 --> 25:48.041
to facilitate things.

25:48.125 --> 25:51.417
Will you tell him
that we miss him

25:51.500 --> 25:55.917
and we want to see him?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.166
Why?

25:57.250 --> 26:00.000
Why what?

26:00.083 --> 26:01.375
You came here because
you want

26:01.458 --> 26:02.834
to solve her murder?

26:02.917 --> 26:19.291
Why? To hell with her.

26:19.375 --> 26:20.291
How'd it go?

26:20.375 --> 26:21.959
He's getting
another chance.

26:22.041 --> 26:24.125
But if he so much
as jaywalks during probation,

26:24.208 --> 26:26.959
Judge Haze will lock him up.

26:27.041 --> 26:29.959
So, you want to do
a girls' night soon?

26:30.041 --> 26:32.625
Yeah.

26:32.709 --> 26:35.375
Of course, if you'd rather
go fly a kite,

26:35.458 --> 26:36.375
I'd understand.

26:36.458 --> 26:38.083
laughs

26:38.166 --> 26:47.291
Who you been talking to?

26:47.375 --> 26:50.500
Oh, man,
my shadow again.

26:50.583 --> 26:52.583
You caught a break
today, huh?

26:52.667 --> 26:54.083
I don't know.

26:54.166 --> 26:55.458
You did, Sean.

26:55.542 --> 26:56.792
Don't screw it up.

26:56.875 --> 27:02.834
Thank you for your advice.

27:02.917 --> 27:07.875
Her name was Linda Frandsen.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.291
I told you I could give
a heave-ho.

27:09.375 --> 27:11.709
She kidnapped you
when you were two.

27:11.792 --> 27:15.542
Man, you keep trying to shock
me
and you keep missing.

27:15.625 --> 27:18.417
I'm just giving you
the straight story.

27:18.500 --> 27:23.208
Here's the rest:

27:23.291 --> 27:24.375
we found your parents.

27:24.458 --> 27:26.834
What?

27:26.917 --> 27:28.375
Yeah.

27:28.458 --> 27:31.125
Mom and Dad?

27:31.208 --> 27:32.917
I got a bunch
of brothers and sisters, too?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.959
Two brothers.

27:35.041 --> 27:37.417
You know what?

27:37.500 --> 27:38.959
You can have 'em.

27:39.041 --> 27:42.041
They don't want me,
they want you.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.208
You talk to 'em?

27:44.291 --> 27:46.500
They want to meet you.

27:46.583 --> 27:47.959
I bet.

27:48.041 --> 27:51.083
They got to be thrilled
their kid's a juvie
delinquent.

27:51.166 --> 27:53.041
Sean, you got a family
waiting for you.

27:53.125 --> 27:55.542
I don't want a family.

27:55.625 --> 27:56.875
You know, I would
have settled

27:56.959 --> 27:58.375
to have one parent
looking out for me.

27:58.458 --> 28:00.083
Here you got two
and you're snubbing it?

28:00.166 --> 28:04.125
I didn't realize
you was such a hothead.

28:04.208 --> 28:07.625
Sean, you can be the kind
of kid they want,

28:07.709 --> 28:08.667
or be a thug.

28:08.750 --> 28:13.750
It's up to you.

28:13.834 --> 28:15.917
Snatching babies, huh, Vic?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.917
What?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.250
Thought you'd work the old
razzle-dazzle on us,

28:19.333 --> 28:20.417
send us
to Dr. Silver

28:20.500 --> 28:21.291
and the trail
would end there.

28:21.375 --> 28:22.583
But it didn't.

28:22.667 --> 28:25.500
I'm sorry.
You fellows are losing me.

28:25.583 --> 28:27.667
It led to your old employers,
the Gordons.

28:27.750 --> 28:31.166
Yeah, where you and Linda
stole a baby.

28:31.250 --> 28:31.792
Come on.

28:31.875 --> 28:33.125
And afterwards,

28:33.208 --> 28:35.000
we're thinking
Linda must have ditched you.

28:35.083 --> 28:36.917
Yeah, that's why you looked
her up, to wipe her out.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.083
I want a lawyer.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.750
We'll get you
a judge and jury, too.

28:39.834 --> 28:41.750
You do that,
'cause I didn't kill her.

28:41.834 --> 28:44.208
Say we're in the jury box
and we're eyeballing Vic here.

28:44.291 --> 28:45.750
We know
he's a kidnapper.

28:45.834 --> 28:46.959
I didn't do that.

28:47.041 --> 28:48.208
You ain't going
to beat that one, Vic.

28:48.291 --> 28:49.333
That'd be
a one-in-a-million shot.

28:49.417 --> 28:50.750
Think about how whupped he was

28:50.834 --> 28:54.166
by this Linda,
so much he swiped
a baby for her.

28:54.250 --> 28:56.333
Did a federal crime
for his lady

28:56.417 --> 28:58.458
and she gives you
the high hat?

28:58.542 --> 28:59.291
I see motive,
real clear.

28:59.375 --> 29:00.917
Oh, yeah.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.333
Who do you think the jury's
going to put the murder on?

29:03.417 --> 29:04.291
I did not do murder.

29:04.375 --> 29:05.125
Okay. Good luck with that.

29:05.208 --> 29:06.125
I didn't!

29:06.208 --> 29:13.041
I only ripped off the kid.

29:13.125 --> 29:16.542
After Linda lost
that other yo-yo's baby,

29:16.625 --> 29:18.375
she come back to me.

29:18.458 --> 29:22.166
I wanted her to stay.

29:22.250 --> 29:24.333
I said I'd do anything.

29:24.417 --> 29:26.709
What'd she say?

29:26.792 --> 29:49.417
"Prove it."

29:49.500 --> 29:50.375
Anyone see you?

29:50.458 --> 29:51.333
I don't know.

29:51.417 --> 29:54.083
Calm down. Calm...
Look at me.

29:54.166 --> 29:55.709
Hand him over.

29:55.792 --> 29:58.458
Give me my boy.

29:58.542 --> 29:59.500
Scoot over, I'll drive.

29:59.583 --> 30:01.125
No, darling,
you got to get back.

30:01.208 --> 30:02.375
Finish your work.

30:02.458 --> 30:04.208
I can't go back.
I'm nervous.

30:04.291 --> 30:06.375
Horse, you're such my baby, too.

30:06.458 --> 30:09.375
You go on.
You be strong for me,

30:09.458 --> 30:10.625
okay?

30:10.709 --> 30:11.875
In a few hours

30:11.959 --> 30:13.500
you'll be seeing us
at the motel.

30:13.583 --> 30:15.417
Go on.

30:15.500 --> 30:19.166
Go on.

30:19.250 --> 30:23.291
I got back to the motel
that night, she'd cleared out.

30:23.375 --> 30:23.959
Just like that?

30:24.041 --> 30:25.625
She left a note.

30:25.709 --> 30:28.709
Said she's going
to Philly to find
us new haunts.

30:28.792 --> 30:30.083
That she'd send for me.

30:30.166 --> 30:32.208
Meanwhile, I'm supposed
to keep clocking in

30:32.291 --> 30:33.250
over at the Gordon's.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.583
Never got the call, huh?

30:36.667 --> 30:39.417
Weeks turned into years.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.417
Who else knew
she came to Philadelphia?

30:41.500 --> 30:46.125
A few years later,
I told this guy

30:46.208 --> 30:47.709
that'd come around
asking questions
about her.

30:47.792 --> 30:48.709
What guy?

30:48.792 --> 30:50.458
A private investigator.

30:50.542 --> 30:53.458
P.I. say what
he wanted with Linda?

30:53.542 --> 30:56.291
No, I didn't push it.

30:56.375 --> 30:59.083
I was pretty torqued off
by then.

30:59.166 --> 31:03.291
I told him, "Hey, she's
somewhere in Philly."

31:03.375 --> 31:05.250
<i>Vic copped to the kidnapping,</i>

31:05.333 --> 31:06.458
not the murder.

31:06.542 --> 31:07.583
You believe him?

31:07.667 --> 31:09.208
Linda humiliated him
pretty good.

31:09.291 --> 31:10.417
Made a fool
of Ned, too.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.750
Seems like that was kind
of the way

31:11.834 --> 31:13.083
she walked through life.

31:13.166 --> 31:14.750
Got a trail of guys
behind her she duped.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.583
Eventually, one of 'em
didn't sit still for it.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.625
The P.I. who approached Vic
was a weasel

31:18.709 --> 31:19.792
by the name of Isiah Bagley.

31:19.875 --> 31:21.333
Did he say who he worked for?

31:21.417 --> 31:24.291
You're going
to love this.
Dr. Kyle Silver.

31:24.375 --> 31:25.333
phone rings

31:25.417 --> 31:26.458
Homicide.

31:26.542 --> 31:28.291
Why's a doctor hire a P.I.?

31:28.375 --> 31:29.625
Thought he was glad
she split.

31:29.709 --> 31:31.667
Bagley said he wanted
her found at any cost.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.959
Okay, thanks.

31:35.041 --> 31:36.750
That was your friend Lindsay.

31:36.834 --> 31:40.875
Sean just got picked up
for stealing a car.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.917
My lawyer says
I could get two years.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.709
I heard.

32:04.792 --> 32:08.333
So I'm supposed to sit
in this joint for two years?

32:08.417 --> 32:09.834
You stole a car
and you were drunk.

32:09.917 --> 32:11.166
Three beers.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.041
Drunk driving
can lead to homicide

32:13.125 --> 32:15.083
and homicide leads to jail
for the rest of your life.

32:15.166 --> 32:16.417
So I get it.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.000
You're as full of it
as everyone else.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.000
Sean...

32:19.083 --> 32:22.125
what is it
that you want?

32:22.208 --> 32:25.417
Right now,
to get up out of here.

32:25.500 --> 32:29.417
Say you're out...

32:29.500 --> 32:31.375
the foster homes, too.

32:31.458 --> 32:32.750
Then what?

32:32.834 --> 32:35.291
I'm on the run
and I'm not looking back.

32:35.375 --> 32:36.667
You taking anyone
with you?

32:36.750 --> 32:38.041
A girl?

32:38.125 --> 32:39.166
Nah.

32:39.250 --> 32:43.000
I'm going to meet my woman.

32:43.083 --> 32:44.375
Someone who
doesn't know you.

32:44.458 --> 32:45.333
Make a fresh start.

32:45.417 --> 32:46.709
Yeah.

32:46.792 --> 32:51.625
And me and her are going
to settle down, kick back

32:51.709 --> 32:53.917
and make a lot of love.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.792
Be careful.

32:56.875 --> 32:57.875
Nah,

32:57.959 --> 32:59.583
no jimmies for me.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.208
I want kids.

33:01.291 --> 33:02.917
I'm going to have 13 of them.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.208
What are you going
to do for work?

33:05.291 --> 33:08.542
Whatever. I don't know.

33:08.625 --> 33:10.625
13 mouths to feed
and you don't know?

33:10.709 --> 33:13.542
So not 13.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.458
Maybe just one.

33:16.542 --> 33:18.875
Make it a girl.
clicks tongue

33:18.959 --> 33:21.458
So what happens
when your little girl

33:21.542 --> 33:24.083
comes home with a purple foot?

33:24.166 --> 33:26.792
Why would she get a purple foot?

33:26.875 --> 33:28.125
Because it's winter time
and you got no job,

33:28.208 --> 33:29.583
your wife has a new guy

33:29.667 --> 33:31.542
and your daughter's got holes
in her shoes.

33:31.625 --> 33:33.417
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, answer me,

33:33.500 --> 33:35.542
What are you going to do?

33:35.625 --> 33:37.458
What are you
going to do?

33:37.542 --> 33:40.208
So you're saying I got no right
to want anything in this life?

33:40.291 --> 33:43.083
No, no, no,
you can have it all.

33:43.166 --> 33:45.291
But you're going
to need help.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.625
How do you know what I need?

33:46.709 --> 33:49.959
Because I wanted
everything, too.

33:50.041 --> 33:54.959
But I was too damned
proud to ask for help

33:55.041 --> 33:57.583
for way too long.

34:00.959 --> 34:04.917
Good luck, okay.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.542
bangs on door

34:06.625 --> 34:07.542
cell door opens

34:07.625 --> 34:11.250
I did want to meet my family.

34:17.542 --> 34:19.000
fist slams table

34:22.458 --> 34:23.709
Silver ever call back?

34:23.792 --> 34:25.250
He's here.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.375
Let's do it.

34:28.041 --> 34:29.917
Detective.

34:32.625 --> 34:34.458
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon...

34:34.542 --> 34:35.583
what are you doing here?

34:35.667 --> 34:37.792
We were told Bobby stole a car.

34:37.875 --> 34:41.625
Jeff, use his other name.
Use "Sean."

34:41.709 --> 34:42.709
How serious is this?

34:42.792 --> 34:43.959
Serious.

34:44.041 --> 34:46.500
He violated his probation,
so he's in custody.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.709
Tomorrow morning
he goes before a judge.

34:48.792 --> 34:50.125
Oh, God.

34:50.208 --> 34:51.583
Maybe we go back
to the hotel,

34:51.667 --> 34:53.709
take the boys home.

34:53.792 --> 34:57.583
It might not be the best way
for the boys to meet Sean.

34:57.667 --> 34:59.000
I see.

34:59.083 --> 35:00.917
We'll just wait till this
whole thing blows over.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.667
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon,
this isn't blowing over.

35:06.750 --> 35:07.834
Sean will probably
go to jail

35:07.917 --> 35:09.500
for the next
two years.

35:09.583 --> 35:11.333
What if we showed up
at the hearing,

35:11.417 --> 35:12.333
would the judge
show leniency?

35:12.417 --> 35:15.458
We can't count on that.

35:15.542 --> 35:20.041
For what it's worth
I know it'll be good for Sean
to see you tomorrow.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.875
Excuse us

35:33.375 --> 35:34.542
Doctor...

35:35.917 --> 35:38.625
Uh, you said your wife
almost divorced you, but

35:38.709 --> 35:43.542
the D.C. Superior Court says
you initiated proceedings.

35:43.625 --> 35:45.250
I was the one who filed.
Big deal.

35:45.333 --> 35:48.208
It's not that you filed, Doc.
It's when you filed.

35:48.291 --> 35:50.625
September '89 a month
before Linda was murdered.

35:50.709 --> 35:51.625
Please...

35:51.709 --> 35:53.375
We know how bad
you wanted Linda.

35:53.458 --> 35:54.583
I admitted that.

35:54.667 --> 35:56.250
But here's what I think Doc.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.667
You already had the wife and
kids experience.

35:58.750 --> 36:02.500
So this time you
wanted a little hottie
to go off with,

36:02.583 --> 36:04.208
have a romp all over Europe.

36:04.291 --> 36:07.625
Linda was your girl.
So sexy it was silly.

36:07.709 --> 36:09.458
But when you tracked her down
you find a baby, too.

36:09.542 --> 36:10.917
Bummer

36:11.000 --> 36:13.291
And now she don't want you
anymore, she only wants the
kid.

36:13.375 --> 36:16.041
So you damn near take her head
off.

36:18.834 --> 36:20.000
Tough to look at huh?

36:20.083 --> 36:21.417
Yeah.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.750
'Cause she was a decent girl.

36:22.834 --> 36:25.709
Silver, we know you hired a
P.I.
to find Linda.

36:25.792 --> 36:28.250
You had Isiah Bagley
on the case for six months.

36:28.333 --> 36:35.750
So don't tell us you never
went
to see her again.

36:35.834 --> 36:37.125
Okay I visited Linda.

36:37.208 --> 36:40.041
On October 11, 1989...
that night?

36:44.458 --> 36:46.041
It was somewhat like you said.

36:47.792 --> 36:50.250
I went there to take Linda
away
but she didn't want to go.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.583
But I took it in stride.

36:55.083 --> 36:56.792
You just left.

36:56.875 --> 37:03.583
I hopped on a train to
Washington, D.C.

37:03.667 --> 37:05.792
You were travelling by train.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.375
Not a car?
Can you prove that?

37:07.458 --> 37:10.792
I purchased a round trip
ticket
from Washington D.C.

37:10.875 --> 37:12.041
Look it up.

37:12.125 --> 37:13.000
We will.

37:13.083 --> 37:15.041
Here's another bummer Doc.

37:15.125 --> 37:18.959
Linda's son could put you
in her house at
the time of the murder.

37:19.041 --> 37:21.083
He remembers
you taking that train.

37:21.166 --> 37:22.959
A three year old remembers
me taking a train.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.083
That's not even worth my
calling
a lawyer.

37:25.166 --> 37:27.875
Well it's enough for us to call
a judge to make you submit DNA.

37:27.959 --> 37:32.750
And the hair samples and prints
we got.
That's put you away evidence.

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
That little boy spent 9 hours
sitting in his mom's blood.

37:40.917 --> 37:42.041
I wanted what I wanted.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.917
She should have just come away
with me.

38:00.542 --> 38:02.166
Kyle...

38:02.250 --> 38:03.542
You gonna invite me in?

38:04.792 --> 38:07.917
Four years. You look so
different, Rebecca!

38:09.041 --> 38:10.166
How did you...?

38:10.250 --> 38:14.583
Rebecca. I like that Linda.
Sexy.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.166
How did you find me?

38:17.250 --> 38:18.875
Well it wasn't easy and it
wasn't cheap.

38:18.959 --> 38:21.083
But the important thing
is I'm here.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.500
What do you want?

38:24.500 --> 38:26.000
What do you think I want?

38:26.083 --> 38:27.917
You!

38:28.000 --> 38:29.750
You had your chance.

38:29.834 --> 38:33.875
But I told you then
it was wrong.
The kids were still in school.

38:33.959 --> 38:40.208
And I told you I wasn't giving
up. Now I have what I wanted.

38:40.291 --> 38:43.625
Yes and that we
need to talk about.

38:43.709 --> 38:46.041
What a good looking boy.

38:46.125 --> 38:48.041
Funny. He doesn't resemble you.

38:48.125 --> 38:51.375
Why don't you just
go back to D.C. Kyle.

38:51.458 --> 38:53.208
I know what you've done.

38:53.291 --> 38:55.250
I know every move you've made
for the last six months.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.417
Walk out of here.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.333
Relax. I'm going to help you.

38:58.417 --> 38:59.917
Sean's the man in my life now.
I don't need anyone else.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.375
Linda if you look at it
you have two choices.

39:02.458 --> 39:04.625
You can come with me
or you can go to prison.

39:04.709 --> 39:06.875
Come with you?
Are you high?

39:06.959 --> 39:08.917
I know how to get
Bobby back home.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.792
Don't call him that.

39:11.875 --> 39:14.583
Nobody's going to know
where he's been, right Bobby?

39:14.667 --> 39:17.625
Don't touch him.

39:18.667 --> 39:20.250
You always did like it dirty.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.041
Let me put my tongue
in your mouth.

39:25.125 --> 39:26.208
Don't talk to me like that.

39:26.291 --> 39:28.500
Why?
You know you love it.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.875
Linda: (scoffs)
You gotta be kidding.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.000
What are you smiling at?

39:37.500 --> 39:38.583
You.

39:39.542 --> 39:41.417
You are the worst I ever had.

40:11.709 --> 40:14.375
Sorry Bobby I gotta
catch a train.
