WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.617
Okay, girls, gotta go to work. I'm late.

00:06.687 --> 00:08.656
Where are you working today, Daddy?

00:10.391 --> 00:13.486
Actually, today I'm working
for a governmental contractor

00:13.561 --> 00:16.292
under the auspices of
the Michigan Department of Highways.

00:16.364 --> 00:17.730
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:20.034 --> 00:21.798
I'm fixing potholes.

00:23.237 --> 00:25.968
- Well, have fun. Bye-bye, Marty.
- Bye.

00:26.641 --> 00:29.577
Okay, girls, we gotta get busy.
You know what day Sunday is.

00:29.644 --> 00:31.704
- Valentine's Day.
- Yup.

00:31.779 --> 00:34.943
And I bought cards for all your friends.

00:35.049 --> 00:37.814
I always loved Valentine's Day.

00:37.919 --> 00:41.879
Except for when I was in sixth grade
and I got braces on my teeth

00:41.956 --> 00:46.121
and the only valentine I got from was
this kid named Jason Schumacher.

00:46.193 --> 00:48.025
The kid with head lice.

00:48.896 --> 00:52.196
Then, in eighth grade,
the braces came off, the bra came on,

00:52.266 --> 00:55.498
and then, "Hello, valentines."
I was swimming in them.

00:55.570 --> 00:57.095
Aunt Jill...

00:57.672 --> 00:59.334
I'm sorry. Okay.

00:59.774 --> 01:02.938
Claire, I have your class roster here.

01:03.010 --> 01:05.479
And your first name is Gary Adams.

01:05.546 --> 01:09.108
Now, the key is to write a really
personal little message on them.

01:09.917 --> 01:11.010
Next?

01:12.420 --> 01:14.753
Well, that's a way to go.
Okay.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.483
Gracie, your first name is
Tommy Anderson.

01:17.558 --> 01:20.687
I'm gonna write a special one to him.
He likes me.

01:20.761 --> 01:22.730
That's because he thinks you're me.

01:22.830 --> 01:24.799
Well, that's not a nice thing
to say, Gracie.

01:24.865 --> 01:26.094
I'm Claire.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.534
- I knew that.
- Hey, guys.

01:28.636 --> 01:31.196
- Guess what's happening on Sunday?
- Well, we know,

01:31.272 --> 01:33.832
but we're frankly surprised
that you know.

01:33.908 --> 01:37.936
I think I'd remember the day I get my
custom shift knob for the hot rod.

01:38.012 --> 01:41.380
Shifter-knob Sunday.
And me without a ham.

01:41.916 --> 01:44.852
Custom-made, you know?
It's the last piece of the puzzle.

01:44.919 --> 01:45.919
Found it up in Lansing.

01:45.987 --> 01:47.925
Guy's gonna scoot it down here.
It'll be here Sunday.

01:47.955 --> 01:50.424
Once I screw it on,
the hot rod is complete.

01:50.491 --> 01:54.394
- Finished? Done? Over?
- As in over with, <i>finito</i>, that's it.

01:54.462 --> 01:57.557
Wow, girls, your Uncle Tim
finally finished the hot rod.

01:57.632 --> 02:00.534
You're finishing your hot rod
for Valentine's Day?

02:00.601 --> 02:03.366
- That's right, Claire.
- I'm Gracie.

02:03.938 --> 02:05.804
I knew that.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.758 --> 03:00.592
So, do you have any ideas about
what to do on the big day?

03:00.661 --> 03:03.790
Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking we could
go to Sorrentino's for dinner,

03:03.864 --> 03:06.390
and then go listen to some jazz
and then...

03:07.268 --> 03:09.100
You're not talking about
Valentine's Day.

03:09.170 --> 03:11.435
You're talking about finishing
the hot rod.

03:11.505 --> 03:15.033
Absolutely not.
I'm talking about unveiling the hot rod.

03:15.710 --> 03:16.710
Oh.

03:16.844 --> 03:19.364
Well, once I get it finished,
I gotta think of some exciting way

03:19.413 --> 03:20.972
to show it to the audience.

03:21.082 --> 03:24.109
Well, how about this?
Okay, you start up the engine,

03:24.185 --> 03:25.551
- you drive it out.
- I like it.

03:25.619 --> 03:27.558
- People everywhere are cheering.
- They're cheering.

03:27.588 --> 03:29.955
Then you make this big announcement.

03:30.057 --> 03:33.755
"This is the last hot rod
I will ever build."

03:38.299 --> 03:39.528
Good one.

03:41.102 --> 03:43.867
- Well, we're off to school.
- You gonna be able to drive?

03:43.971 --> 03:45.200
Yeah. I'll be fine. I just...

03:45.272 --> 03:49.209
I don't know how I'm gonna carry home
all those valentines I'll be getting.

03:49.276 --> 03:53.213
I'm sure you'll have plenty of
cargo space in that swelled head.

03:54.248 --> 03:55.409
- See you, guys.
- All right.

03:55.516 --> 03:57.688
You guys aren't leaving
till you both come up with an idea

03:57.718 --> 04:00.381
- about the hot rod show for me.
- Dad, I got a geometry test.

04:00.454 --> 04:02.423
Mark, this is important.

04:03.457 --> 04:05.119
How about a real emotional <i>Tool Time?</i>

04:05.192 --> 04:07.491
- Go with it. Come on.
- What could be more dramatic

04:07.561 --> 04:11.020
than giving your eldest son
the keys to that '46 Ford?

04:12.733 --> 04:14.031
Good one.

04:15.636 --> 04:18.800
- Why don't you just make a video?
- A video, sure. What about?

04:18.906 --> 04:21.067
Like a tribute to the hot rod.

04:21.175 --> 04:23.214
You know, with interviews
with the people that made it.

04:23.244 --> 04:24.281
A video tribute. That's good.

04:24.311 --> 04:25.649
- That's a great idea.
- I like that idea.

04:25.679 --> 04:27.952
- Maybe you could work on it.
- You mean, like, create it?

04:27.982 --> 04:30.474
Sure. You did a great job on
Brad's soccer video.

04:30.551 --> 04:32.713
But this is a big, professional project.

04:32.787 --> 04:34.221
But it's just a small segment.

04:34.288 --> 04:36.594
I think he can do it.
He's been interning down at <i>Tool Time.</i>

04:36.624 --> 04:39.093
- He's been doing a great job.
- Thank you, Dad.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.493
- I promise, I won't disappoint you.
- Don't disappoint me.

04:41.562 --> 04:43.467
But there's ground rules.
Three of them. Big ones.

04:43.497 --> 04:45.932
My show, my show, my show.

04:48.769 --> 04:50.601
- I gotta go.
- All right. And remember,

04:50.671 --> 04:52.970
I want the video up to
<i>Tool Time</i> high standards, okay?

04:53.040 --> 04:54.941
Gotcha. I'll blow something up.

04:58.345 --> 05:01.713
It's really nice,
your giving Mark this chance.

05:02.383 --> 05:04.409
I've got a lot of confidence in that kid.

05:04.485 --> 05:07.455
And he might be able to bring
a younger audience in.

05:07.555 --> 05:10.389
I could reach young tool men
and mold them

05:10.457 --> 05:13.222
before their minds are fully functioning.

05:17.998 --> 05:20.092
And after 24 hours,
you'll have the appearance

05:20.167 --> 05:23.535
of natural wood grain
on your aluminum door.

05:23.604 --> 05:27.041
Now, that's what I call
a simply fabulous faux finish.

05:28.776 --> 05:31.473
And that's what I call
simply spending too much time

05:31.545 --> 05:33.104
with your mother.

05:35.249 --> 05:38.549
We'll be right back after these words
from Binford.

05:42.556 --> 05:44.923
Well, Tim, Al and Heidi here.

05:45.025 --> 05:47.688
You might recognize us
from over there.

05:48.229 --> 05:51.063
Poor air quality
is an issue we all deal with.

05:51.131 --> 05:55.569
Many of us in urban areas
are forced to breathe noxious fumes.

05:55.636 --> 05:58.697
Heidi's the one
that had the breakfast burrito.

05:59.974 --> 06:03.035
To protect ourselves from pollutants
and particles in the air,

06:03.110 --> 06:07.480
we're proud to introduce the
Binford 6100 sports respirator.

06:08.349 --> 06:11.842
It's lightweight, and fashionable.

06:12.052 --> 06:15.147
Plus the mouthpiece comes
in designer colors, a full array of them.

06:15.222 --> 06:16.781
Mine's kiwi.

06:17.157 --> 06:20.594
- Breathe cleaner, healthier air.
- Breathe Binford.

06:24.598 --> 06:26.533
Well, that finishes up
another <i>Tool Time</i> show.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.771
Al, why don't you tell everybody

06:27.801 --> 06:29.241
about the big show we got coming up?

06:29.303 --> 06:31.795
That's right.
Be sure to tune in Tuesday

06:31.872 --> 06:34.432
for a very special <i>Tool Time,</i>
when Tim presents

06:34.508 --> 06:37.205
his totally restored
'46 Ford convertible.

06:37.278 --> 06:40.737
Plus a little video tribute
directed and created by my son, Mark.

06:40.814 --> 06:43.079
You know,
you have your family working here.

06:43.150 --> 06:46.177
What would it take
to get Mother on the show?

06:47.955 --> 06:50.925
We'd have to widen that door
and put some brisket down.

06:57.164 --> 06:59.190
Tell us about the engine.

06:59.567 --> 07:03.834
Well, she's got 225 horsepower
at 5500 RPM.

07:03.904 --> 07:06.874
And she's ported,
polished and relieved.

07:06.941 --> 07:07.965
- Full...
- Full race cam

07:08.042 --> 07:09.476
and three Stromberg 97s.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.781
Dad, you're in my shot.

07:17.117 --> 07:20.281
The electrical on this '46 Ford is
wired like a computer.

07:20.387 --> 07:22.356
It's all parallel, no crisscross.

07:22.456 --> 07:25.517
The connectors, heat-shrunk.
Prevents corrosion.

07:25.593 --> 07:28.859
Yeah, no corrosion on those babies.
No corrosion.

07:33.233 --> 07:36.397
Hi, I'm Eddie. I'm Tim's body shop guy.

07:36.970 --> 07:40.304
So tell us what you see
when you look at my dad's hot rod.

07:40.374 --> 07:42.138
I see dollar signs.

07:44.411 --> 07:47.643
See? Yeah.
I see Eddie Junior going to Harvard.

07:48.782 --> 07:51.149
I see early retirement.

07:51.251 --> 07:52.913
I see a little place in Rio.

07:52.986 --> 07:56.081
I see a fake passport and a new wife.
Young. I like 'em young.

07:56.156 --> 07:58.716
- Hey, cut, cut, cut.
- They gotta be young.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.954
Eddie, family show, baby.

08:07.201 --> 08:10.330
I really loved working on this car.

08:10.404 --> 08:13.169
I can't believe the odyssey
is finally over.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.004
Seems like only yesterday that Tim

08:15.075 --> 08:17.772
asked me to match
the ruby-pearl exterior

08:17.845 --> 08:21.338
with the beautiful
distressed leather upholstery.

08:21.415 --> 08:26.046
And then the joy we both felt
on the day we found the right color

08:26.120 --> 08:28.680
and fabric for the convertible top.

08:30.057 --> 08:33.619
I can still smell that German canvas.

08:35.496 --> 08:38.364
Like the top of a baby's head.

08:42.503 --> 08:46.167
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do this.
Thanks, Tim.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.080
- Hi.
- Hey. Tough day

08:54.148 --> 08:57.050
- out there on the blacktop?
- Yeah.

08:57.117 --> 08:58.989
You know,
it's not filling the potholes that I mind,

08:59.019 --> 09:01.045
it's the groupies.

09:03.390 --> 09:05.825
- Where are my girls?
- They're on a play date

09:05.893 --> 09:08.328
with a friend of theirs,
and Jill took them all to the mall.

09:08.395 --> 09:11.126
She's probably getting me something
really cool for Valentine's Day.

09:11.198 --> 09:13.099
You get her something special?

09:13.167 --> 09:14.571
I did something
she's been wanting me to do

09:14.601 --> 09:17.036
for three years, finish the hot rod.

09:18.572 --> 09:21.633
Yes, I'm getting her something special.

09:21.708 --> 09:22.708
You know, it's funny.

09:22.776 --> 09:24.348
All the time that
Nancy and I were together,

09:24.378 --> 09:26.870
I always figured Valentine's Day
was just some annoying holiday

09:26.947 --> 09:28.643
that women made up.

09:29.583 --> 09:32.553
It's true.
Legend has it it was a little town

09:32.619 --> 09:34.383
called Climax, Michigan.

09:34.488 --> 09:38.016
1964, group of women
around a salad bar.

09:38.092 --> 09:39.856
One was making up Valentine's Day.

09:39.927 --> 09:43.762
The other two were inventing stuff like,
"Dressings on the side,"

09:43.831 --> 09:46.198
and, "I just want to be held."

09:49.203 --> 09:52.298
- What's the matter?
- You know, just...

09:52.372 --> 09:56.104
Seeing all the couples
buying each other cards and presents.

09:57.111 --> 09:59.546
- You know, I miss it.
- You know, what you're going through,

09:59.613 --> 10:01.377
it takes a lot of guts.

10:02.316 --> 10:04.342
You mean living with you?

10:05.619 --> 10:06.985
That, too.

10:08.655 --> 10:11.955
- She'd never do that. Hi, guys.
- Hi.

10:12.025 --> 10:15.189
- Hi.
- Hey, who's this?

10:15.262 --> 10:18.096
This is our friend Christy.
She's staying for dinner.

10:18.165 --> 10:21.192
Well, I'm cooking tonight.
So you're real lucky.

10:21.268 --> 10:23.100
We'll see about that.

10:24.404 --> 10:26.532
Feisty little thing.

10:26.607 --> 10:27.607
Hey.

10:27.674 --> 10:29.046
You guys are a little late.
Where have you been?

10:29.076 --> 10:31.011
Mark was in the editing room
for two hours,

10:31.078 --> 10:33.604
and I had to stand in the hall
on my bum leg.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.809
- Why didn't you just sit down?
- Shoot.

10:40.654 --> 10:41.825
- Finished the video.
- Well, good.

10:41.855 --> 10:43.414
Let's take a look at it. Come on.

10:43.490 --> 10:44.788
Dad, Dad.

10:48.729 --> 10:50.630
So, how did it come out?

10:50.697 --> 10:52.427
I think it's the best thing I've ever done.

10:52.499 --> 10:53.660
All right.

10:53.734 --> 10:56.067
Thank you so much for
giving me the chance.

10:56.136 --> 10:58.071
I can't wait to see it.

10:58.539 --> 11:03.978
<i>She's got 225 horsepower
at 5500 RPMs. She's ported...</i>

11:05.379 --> 11:06.745
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:07.881 --> 11:10.214
<i>Heat-shrunk. Prevents corrosion.</i>

11:10.284 --> 11:13.652
<i>Hi. I'm Eddie, Tim's body shop guy.</i>

11:16.223 --> 11:19.125
<i>I see early retirement.
I see a little place in Rio.</i>

11:19.193 --> 11:21.958
<i>I see fake passports and a new wife.
Yeah, and she's young.</i>

11:22.029 --> 11:24.555
<i>I like 'em young. She's gotta be...</i>

11:25.332 --> 11:29.633
<i>Finally got the right color
and fabric for the convertible top.</i>

11:46.753 --> 11:48.619
So, what'd you think?

11:49.890 --> 11:51.791
It stunk.

11:52.693 --> 11:55.322
Christy, it did not stink.

11:55.395 --> 11:56.727
Anybody else?

11:56.797 --> 11:59.733
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to go with Christy.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.964
- Brad.
- It didn't stink.

12:04.304 --> 12:07.399
- Thank you, Claire.
- It was scary.

12:07.474 --> 12:08.806
Dad?

12:10.077 --> 12:11.443
Well.

12:11.511 --> 12:15.573
That was different. I liked the way
you switched the guys' heads.

12:15.649 --> 12:18.016
That was good. But...

12:18.085 --> 12:20.452
- But what?
- You know, I hate telling you this.

12:20.554 --> 12:24.685
I mean, it was... It's a new policy,
just came down at Binford today.

12:24.758 --> 12:27.250
It's a union thing,
and since you're not part of the union...

12:27.327 --> 12:29.353
You're not gonna show it, are you?

12:29.429 --> 12:32.922
Well, I'd like to show it,
but it's a union thing.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.128
He thinks it stinks, too.

12:46.413 --> 12:48.780
Look, I know the video was bizarre.

12:48.849 --> 12:51.148
But isn't there something
that you can do?

12:51.218 --> 12:54.655
Sure. I could present it to the devil
as an offering.

12:55.923 --> 12:59.416
Couldn't you do
some sort of special blooper show?

12:59.493 --> 13:02.463
Mom, Dad already has one.
It's called <i>Tool Time.</i>

13:03.330 --> 13:06.027
Well, what about re-editing it,
so it works?

13:06.099 --> 13:08.466
And what if it doesn't?
Then I disappoint him twice?

13:08.568 --> 13:11.265
Well, all I know is we've got
a 14-year-old who's crushed.

13:11.338 --> 13:13.777
Seems to me you should have
thought this through more carefully

13:13.807 --> 13:16.709
before you made a promise
you couldn't keep.

13:19.346 --> 13:22.510
Maybe there's
something in it I can use, you know?

13:36.263 --> 13:39.324
Happy Valentine's Day, good neighbor.

13:39.399 --> 13:42.062
Why don't you just
send a greeting card?

13:42.536 --> 13:45.301
Well, some historians claim
that Valentine's Day can be traced

13:45.405 --> 13:47.374
to the ancient festival of Lupercalia.

13:47.441 --> 13:49.205
See, in Rome,
people would slap each other

13:49.276 --> 13:52.440
using animal pelts, to heighten fertility.

13:52.512 --> 13:55.004
We used to do that in high school.

13:55.082 --> 13:57.574
Using a wet towel
would just heighten people's voices.

14:00.053 --> 14:01.715
It is great fun, I'll tell you.

14:01.788 --> 14:05.020
I bet Jill would love to strike you
with an animal hide.

14:05.092 --> 14:07.960
I bet you Mark would like to
take a whack at me himself.

14:08.895 --> 14:10.796
Yeah. Jill told me about the video.

14:10.864 --> 14:13.095
I cannot show that video on <i>Tool Time.</i>

14:13.166 --> 14:15.328
On the other hand,
I don't want to discourage the kid

14:15.435 --> 14:17.301
from doing something
he's passionate about.

14:17.371 --> 14:19.863
So, in the words
of the Anglican leader Lorenzo Dow,

14:19.940 --> 14:22.705
"You're damned if you do,
and you're damned if you don't."

14:22.776 --> 14:25.712
You can go back to
your lubrication festival.

14:26.646 --> 14:27.978
Tim, let me ask you something.

14:28.048 --> 14:30.415
When you asked Mark
to create this video,

14:30.484 --> 14:32.419
- did you give him any guidelines?
- Yeah.

14:32.486 --> 14:35.251
I said,
it was my show, my show, my show.

14:39.259 --> 14:41.228
Not much to go on, is it?

14:41.561 --> 14:43.867
It's like telling a guy to build
a house without blueprints.

14:43.897 --> 14:46.867
- Which is something you wouldn't do.
- I might.

14:48.068 --> 14:51.129
I actually did once.
That house was a disaster.

14:51.204 --> 14:52.943
- Yeah.
- But the ratings went through the roof,

14:52.973 --> 14:54.339
just like the water heater.

14:56.209 --> 14:58.701
You know, Tim, Mark has his
own vision and you have yours.

14:58.779 --> 15:00.805
Now, if you want
to hire him for your show,

15:00.881 --> 15:02.941
you've got to communicate
what you want

15:03.016 --> 15:05.178
in an articulate
and a professional manner.

15:05.285 --> 15:07.151
- I love articulating.
- Yeah.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.625
Maybe the two of you can
work together.

15:08.655 --> 15:11.591
They say, sometimes, that two heads
are better than one.

15:11.658 --> 15:13.752
So, you did see the video?

15:24.371 --> 15:26.203
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey, Brad.

15:34.848 --> 15:37.477
Hey, Brad, could you give us a minute?

15:40.620 --> 15:43.055
Don't worry about it.
I don't feel like talking.

15:43.123 --> 15:44.123
Brad, please. Come on.

15:44.191 --> 15:46.251
Yeah. Is there anything
you want me to get you?

15:46.326 --> 15:49.296
Not now.
But come back in a minute, yeah.

15:49.396 --> 15:52.366
- I want to talk about your video.
- What about it?

15:52.466 --> 15:55.436
Well, I looked at it again.
And it's real creative, you know?

15:55.535 --> 15:58.095
And it shows a lot of humor.

15:58.205 --> 16:01.175
- Come on. You thought it sucked.
- No, I didn't. Not at all.

16:01.274 --> 16:02.833
I mean, when Sparky was crying there,

16:02.943 --> 16:06.311
I got goose bumps.
At least I think that's what those were.

16:08.515 --> 16:11.383
Well, I looked it over again,
and I thought it sucked.

16:11.451 --> 16:14.011
What did you think
was the matter with it?

16:14.120 --> 16:18.558
It was just too flashy and overdone.
It had nothing to do with your show.

16:18.925 --> 16:22.020
That's true.
But I think I know why you did it.

16:22.896 --> 16:25.923
- You do?
- Yeah. It all comes back to <i>Tool Time.</i>

16:26.399 --> 16:29.699
- It's called "The Lost Episode."
- Never heard of it.

16:30.136 --> 16:35.302
Hence the name "Lost Episode."
Nobody's seen it. Not even Mom.

16:35.842 --> 16:36.880
When I got out of college,

16:36.910 --> 16:38.715
I was just fresh out of
two film classes, right?

16:38.745 --> 16:40.250
I got my own show,
and I wanted to show off.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.600
You know, my creativity
was just burning through me, right?

16:42.649 --> 16:44.584
So, I did my first episode
about building a table

16:44.651 --> 16:47.018
from the perspective of the saw.

16:48.321 --> 16:49.321
Man.

16:49.389 --> 16:52.416
Yeah, that's what Binford said.
That's what the crowd said.

16:52.492 --> 16:54.586
That's what the saw blade
actually said.

16:56.429 --> 16:57.727
- The saw?
- It talked.

16:58.899 --> 17:01.459
- Binford didn't like it too much.
- So, what did they do?

17:01.535 --> 17:04.007
Well, they sat me down and we had
a nice conversation about it.

17:04.037 --> 17:07.701
And they gave me some directions,
not the dumb guidelines I gave you.

17:07.773 --> 17:09.538
And I'm thinking that if we brainstorm

17:09.608 --> 17:10.847
with some of the guys
down at <i>Tool Time,</i>

17:10.877 --> 17:12.749
we could come up
with a great episode for next week.

17:12.779 --> 17:14.483
- You're giving me a second chance?
- You bet I am.

17:14.513 --> 17:17.780
Come on, this is about our hot rod.
I'm not just letting anybody do this.

17:17.851 --> 17:19.819
- All right. Let's get started.
- All right.

17:19.886 --> 17:22.320
We need some notes first,
on that first scene. You thirsty?

17:22.388 --> 17:23.388
- Yeah.
- Hey, Brad,

17:23.455 --> 17:25.686
will you bring down
some root beers, please?

17:27.359 --> 17:30.057
Well, we're just about to reveal
Tim's '46 Ford convertible.

17:30.130 --> 17:32.827
Hey, Tim, you want to tell us
a little something about this car?

17:32.899 --> 17:35.130
<i>Why, this car is chopped</i>

17:35.869 --> 17:37.428
<i>It's shaved</i>

17:38.138 --> 17:41.006
<i>It's recessed</i>

17:42.242 --> 17:45.371
<i>Why, it's Greased Lightning</i>

17:46.346 --> 17:49.908
<i>I love the overhead lifters
And four-barrel quads, oh, yeah</i>

17:52.686 --> 17:55.815
<i>Fuel injection cut-off
And chrome-plated rods, oh, yeah</i>

17:58.258 --> 18:01.490
<i>With a four-speed on the floor
They'll be waiting at the door</i>

18:01.561 --> 18:04.190
<i>You know without a doubt
I'll be really making out</i>

18:04.264 --> 18:05.425
<i>in Greased Lightning</i>

18:05.532 --> 18:08.832
<i>Go, go, go Go, Greased Lightning</i>

18:08.902 --> 18:11.064
<i>You're burning up the quarter mile</i>

18:11.138 --> 18:13.698
<i>Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning</i>

18:13.773 --> 18:15.207
<i>Go, Greased Lightning</i>

18:15.275 --> 18:17.107

<i>Greased Lightning

18:20.613 --> 18:23.344

18:23.416 --> 18:25.146
<i>Go, go, go</i>

18:25.218 --> 18:29.178
<i>I'll have me purple French tail lights
and 30-inch fins, oh, yeah</i>

18:31.458 --> 18:35.088
<i>A palomino dashboard
and dual muffler twins, oh, yeah</i>

18:37.263 --> 18:40.427
<i>With new pistons, plugs and shocks
She could beat the super stocks</i>

18:40.533 --> 18:43.298
<i>You know that I ain't bragging
She's a real dragon wagon</i>

18:43.370 --> 18:46.704
<i>Greased Lightning Go, go, go</i>

18:46.773 --> 18:50.471
<i>Go, Greased Lightning

20:23.970 --> 20:25.975
Pretty proud of you. It looks good.
Looks great, actually.

20:26.005 --> 20:27.564
Thanks, Dad.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.872
God, it was such a good idea
for you to think of <i>Greased Lightning.</i>

20:30.944 --> 20:33.470
- Yeah.
- Wow. Heidi was great.

20:35.582 --> 20:38.950
- What about us?
- You were in it?

20:41.921 --> 20:43.993
- By the way, Dad...
- Nah, don't even bother thanking me.

20:44.023 --> 20:45.161
It was all you. It was a good idea.

20:45.191 --> 20:48.059
Actually, I wasn't going to.
I went way over budget.

20:48.128 --> 20:49.960
Can I get reimbursed?

20:51.131 --> 20:54.101
Son, you have a lot to learn
about the film business.

20:57.036 --> 21:01.132
<i>Well, it's got overhead lifters
And four-barrel quads, oh, yeah</i>

21:03.743 --> 21:06.907
