"Thanks, Dad."

01:26.880 --> 01:30.320
Sorry. Sorry, I was miles away.
Got to get everything ready for today.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.040
This with some computer people?

01:32.120 --> 01:35.960
Yeah. Tuckersoft.
They do Colin Ritman's games.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.560
Oh, not the Colin Ritman.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.160
Mr. Thakur, the owner,

01:42.240 --> 01:43.840
said I could show them
my Bandersnatch demo.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.840
- Your Bander-what?
- Bandersnatch.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.920
I've based it on the book.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.600
Was that your mother's?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.240
It was in her things, yeah.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.400
- Don't know if she read it though.
- Don't think so.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.000
"Jerome F. Davies."

02:03.800 --> 02:05.320
Well, he can't be a great writer.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.280
You're always flicking backwards
and forwards in that.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.120
No, it's a "Choose Your Own Adventure"
book.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.440
You decide what your character does.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.120
- You know, like a game.
- Sounds thrilling.

02:16.560 --> 02:20.880
How about you decide
what you want for your breakfast?

02:24.360 --> 02:28.400
Both seem a bit kiddywink to me,
but you will insist.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.840
Oi!

04:05.520 --> 04:09.880
Alright, fetch us 20 B&H, would you?
And... Lion bar.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.160
Good boy.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.080
Ah!

04:13.480 --> 04:15.760
You... are... Steven.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.040
- Stefan.
- Stefan, sorry, mate.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.399
That's alright. I get it all the time.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.640
Sorry about the chaos.
We just moved in Monday.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.480
It's big.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.040
Well, expansion, that's my plan.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.680
Imagine, OK.
A whole team just for graphics,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.080
another for sound, for gameplay.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.840
We're going to be a hit factory.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.400
Like Motown but for computer games.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.160
You heard it here first.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.160
That's Colin's new one.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.640
- Colin Ritman?
- That's him over there.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.880
That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.040
Let's say hello.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.840
- Sure he won't mind? He's working.
- He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Shh! Shh!

04:57.200 --> 04:58.160
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.440
What's this, Kajagoogoo?

05:04.760 --> 05:05.880
You wish.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.240
The state of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

05:09.320 --> 05:10.560
and he still smokes roll-ups.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.720
Well, pre-rolled has strychnine in them,
so the joke's on him.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.520
Anyway, this is Stefan, er...

05:18.600 --> 05:19.840
Butler, Butler.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.320
I'm Colin, yeah?

05:24.800 --> 05:27.640
Yeah, I've played all of your games.
All of them.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.320
Except the Commodore ones,
I don't... don't have a Commodore.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.360
- Great sound chip, the Commodore.
- Mm-hm.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.280
Yeah.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.200
This is my latest.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.600
It's called Nohzdyve.

05:51.600 --> 05:55.240
- The sprites are so smooth.
- That took some doing.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.440
Oh, bollocks.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.240
- What's that?
- It's a buffer error.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.920
The eyeballs have overrun
the video memory--

06:05.000 --> 06:06.680
Oh, yeah, video memory, yeah.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.160
I was going to say that.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.240
Anyway, listen,
let's get down to business.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.600
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.920
Bloody hell.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.640
So it's like 3D Monster Maze?

06:19.200 --> 06:21.040
Only when you're moving
from choice to choice.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.120
- It's actually an adventure game.
- Like The Hobbit?

06:24.200 --> 06:25.280
Yeah, but...

06:25.360 --> 06:27.200
without any typing.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.240
Without any typing?

06:29.320 --> 06:31.120
So no "get lamp" or whatever?

06:31.760 --> 06:32.600
That's right.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.440
Choices come up on the screen
and you pick one against the clock.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.560
OK, he's Pax, he's the demon.
He's in the book.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.440
So we've actually arrived
at a choice point,

06:49.520 --> 06:51.360
and then you can choose with the joystick.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.200
You've got ten seconds.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.600
Worship him.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.880
No, don't do that,
he's the Thief of Destiny...

06:56.960 --> 06:58.320
in the book, I mean.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.840
Got a copy of this at home.
Never got around to reading it.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.840
You should.
Jerome F. Davies was a genius.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.560
Didn't he go bonkers
and cut his wife's head off?

07:07.640 --> 07:09.880
- Yeah, but, I mean, apart from that--
- Excuse me.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.160
What's happened?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.520
Well, I haven't programmed
that pathway yet.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.560
Lot of paths then?

07:19.920 --> 07:22.920
Well, yeah,
if it's going to be like the book.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.560
So, come on.
How do you want to go about this?

07:27.240 --> 07:30.520
- You're... you're interested?
- That's what I'm saying.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.240
OK, it's July now,
so if we want to hit Christmas,

07:33.320 --> 07:35.320
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths
by November.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.080
OK. So here's my proposal.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.760
Come and write it here.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.080
- Here?
- Yeah!

07:42.360 --> 07:45.840
We'll give you a couple of desks,
set up a small team, just for you.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.880
And of course Col's on hand.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.600
What do you reckon?

07:51.120 --> 07:53.280
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

07:53.360 --> 07:56.080
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.560
So, come on. What's your answer?

08:03.120 --> 08:03.960
Yes.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.440
Perfect. Perfect.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.720
OK, so the first thing we need to do
is streamline the project a little.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.720
We can't fit a breeze block
of a book into 48K.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.080
Oh, look at this.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.440
Here you go.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.760
Happy Birthday to me.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.080
Sorry, mate. Wrong path.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.200
The next game under our
Christmas spotlight is Bandersnatch,

08:36.280 --> 08:39.840
in which the player navigates
a shifting timeline of parallel realities,

08:39.919 --> 08:42.640
based on the book of the same name
by Jerome F. Davies.

08:44.400 --> 08:48.520
That's how Bandersnatch works,
but did it "snatch" your respect?

08:48.600 --> 08:50.040
I'm afraid not, Leslie,

08:50.120 --> 08:52.600
for the simple reason
that it's just way too short.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.240
It's over before it's even begun.

08:55.320 --> 08:58.320
This is the one of the first team-created
games from Tuckersoft,

08:58.400 --> 09:01.880
and I think that's given it
a very designed-by-committee feel,

09:01.960 --> 09:05.680
almost like they just rushed out
the simplest, quickest cash-in they could.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.920
What they should've done
is just gone right back to the start

09:08.000 --> 09:08.840
and tried again.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.160
- And your verdict?
- No stars out of five. Terrible.

09:12.240 --> 09:16.160
Oof, well, maybe next week
we'll have something more for you...

09:18.560 --> 09:20.240
That kid knows nothing.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.320
I should try again.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.520
- Stefan.
- I'm trying again.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.360

I've played all of his games.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.880

this yearÂ to buy a Lamborghini

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960

10:13.400 --> 10:14.600
We've met before?

10:15.200 --> 10:16.040
No.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.440
This is what I'm working on.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.720
Nohzdyve.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.320
Yeah... that's right.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.320
- Oh, bollocks.
- What's that?

10:33.400 --> 10:34.480
Buffer error.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.560
The eyeball sprite's overshot
the video memory.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.200
How did you know that?

10:43.200 --> 10:45.920
- Just did.
- Bloody hell, he's good, right?

10:46.400 --> 10:50.960
Anyway, let's get down to business.
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.360
You choose with the joystick.
See. You've got ten seconds.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.760
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.360
- You've read Bandersnatch?
- Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.920
Isn't he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.160
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.760
Which ending did you get?
When you read it.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.360
- All of them.
- Excuse me.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.560
- What's happened?
- I haven't programmed that path yet.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.920
Right. So a lot of paths then?

11:20.400 --> 11:22.520
Well, yes,
if it's going to be like the book.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.320
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.480
It was ahead of its time.
In as much as time exists.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.040
OK. So here's my proposal.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.720
Come and write it here.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.680
- Here?
- We'll give you a couple of desks,

11:36.760 --> 11:39.600
set up a small team, just for you.
And of course Col's on hand.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.440

11:42.840 --> 11:45.040

I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

11:45.120 --> 11:47.440
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.200
So, come on. What's your answer?

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
No.

12:00.200 --> 12:04.520
I mean, yes,
I want to do your game, but I-I just...

12:05.040 --> 12:06.400
I just think I need-I need to...

12:10.480 --> 12:13.800
I need to write it how I know.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.200
You know, just me. At home.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.560
At home. On your own?

12:20.320 --> 12:22.480
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

12:22.560 --> 12:26.840
and I think if I let other people in
it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

12:26.920 --> 12:28.440
"Stressy"?

12:29.440 --> 12:34.240
But I know
that I can do it proper justice.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.480
The book.

12:35.840 --> 12:39.280
You know, divergent story paths.
Parallel realities.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.040
- It's still a game though, yeah?
- I get it.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.000
The lad's a craftsman.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.760
He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.920
- Yeah, but--
- It's like I say,

12:49.640 --> 12:51.520
teams are fine for things
like action titles,

12:51.600 --> 12:53.320
but when it's a concept piece,

12:54.200 --> 12:58.240
bit of madness is what you need
and that works best when it's one mind.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.040
Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate
The Doors of Perception later--

13:01.120 --> 13:02.600
That was Huxley not Leary.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.760
If you're going toÂ write this
on your tod, the important thing is

13:04.840 --> 13:08.520
putting it out for Christmas, Â so I'll
need finished code by 12th September.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.640
- OK, sure.
- But no later.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.480
What do you listen to?

13:21.160 --> 13:24.040
- Hmm?
- To get in to the flow.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.240
Oh, music?

13:30.280 --> 13:32.920
Er... Thompson Twins.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.480
Get a pen.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.520
I'm defrosting mince.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.240
It's like alien technology, this thing.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.440
Oh. How... How did it go?

13:55.160 --> 13:57.520
Er, good. Yeah, really good.

13:59.480 --> 14:02.320
- They're taking it.
- Oh, well, that's great, isn't it?

14:04.080 --> 14:06.040
- Well done, mate.
- You've got mince juice on your hands.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.320
Yes.

14:12.520 --> 14:17.520
So, how does it work then?
Do you go into their office, or...?

14:17.600 --> 14:18.960
No, I write it here.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.640
- On-on your own?
- Yes.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.240
And...

14:29.120 --> 14:32.280
Is that the best way
to work on something like this?

14:32.360 --> 14:33.480
Why wouldn't it be?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.200
Well, the graphics
are certainly impressive, Robin,

14:36.320 --> 14:39.120
but the big question is,
what's it like to play?

14:39.720 --> 14:41.560
Well, the gameplay is just as impressive.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.320
I must say, this is a Colin Ritman game,
so we'd expect little else,

14:45.400 --> 14:49.200
but even by his standards
this is really most impressive.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.080
It's challenging,
there's quite a big learning curve,

14:52.160 --> 14:56.240
so you die a lot and have to try again
but I didn't really mind that much.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.200
So it sounds great
but what's your verdict, Robin?

14:59.280 --> 15:02.040
Four stars out of five.
Colin Ritman does it again.

15:02.120 --> 15:05.120
- So not quite perfect.
- Well, nothing's perfect.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.120
So there I am, there's Colin Ritman--

15:12.200 --> 15:15.040
"The actual Colin Ritman,"
I believe you called him.

15:15.120 --> 15:21.000
Yeah, exactly. And Mr. Thakur's
offering me the chance to work there

15:21.160 --> 15:24.160
in their own office alongside Colin.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.240
And I just...

15:28.400 --> 15:32.240
- I don't know. It was too...
- Too?

15:32.680 --> 15:33.920
Good to be true.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.520
- I said no.
- You said no?

15:39.400 --> 15:40.880
Well, not to the whole thing,

15:40.960 --> 15:43.800
just to working there,
being under their control.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.320
I don't know where it came from,
I just said no

15:46.400 --> 15:50.000
and then had to justify it
by saying that I prefer to work alone.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.600
But I just don't know
where the urge to say it came from.

15:55.240 --> 15:59.040
It sounds like you're growing
in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.000
Well, they're still letting me
do the game, so...

16:03.080 --> 16:07.520
Well done, Stefan. That's great.
That's great.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.720
You sound like my dad.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.640
Oh.

16:18.920 --> 16:19.800
Sorry.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.600
He gets on my nerves sometimes.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.240
Like this... I'm fine now,

16:28.200 --> 16:32.200
I don't see why I need
to keep coming to these sessions.

16:34.840 --> 16:38.360
It just feels like being...
I don't know, monitored.

16:39.960 --> 16:44.360
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon
because of the anniversary looming.

16:45.200 --> 16:50.040
It's a difficult time of year for you.
We can't underestimate that.

16:51.680 --> 16:55.280
Would you like to talk about what
happened with your mother?

16:57.360 --> 17:03.360
It can be helpful to revisit things.
Even if you feel you've done this before.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.960
You might discover something new.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.400
I keep thinking about that morning.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.359
Reliving it.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.280
Rabbit.

17:19.359 --> 17:20.480
It was because of Rabbit.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.640
He was this stupid toy that my mum
had made for me when I was born.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.200
I used to take him everywhere.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.600
I think Dad thought it was sissy
or something.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.440
He and Mum used to
have these rows about it.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.560
By five, he should've
stopped playing with dolls.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.000
I know he took rabbit away
and hid it somewhere.

17:42.880 --> 17:47.080
That morning, Mum was going
to visit Granddad and Grandma.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.920
I was supposed to be going with her,
but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.960
And I refused to go without him.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.800
Come on, Stefan, we're going to be late.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.080
Are you coming or not?

18:07.960 --> 18:09.200
No!

18:09.760 --> 18:12.480
Come on.
You'll have to catch the 8:45, now.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.000
So I held her up.

18:16.680 --> 18:20.240
Because of me she had to catch
a later train. Because of me.

18:21.680 --> 18:24.720
Stefan, how old were you
when this happened?

18:27.560 --> 18:28.440
Five.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.640
You were five years old.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.520
And you couldn't have known.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.720
Stefan.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.640
You couldn't have known.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.320
The Emergency Services say
the 8:45 train derailed

18:43.400 --> 18:46.800
at high speed
outside Queenstown Road Station.

18:49.600 --> 18:54.560
As the death toll continues to rise,
transport police have opened an inquiry,

18:54.640 --> 18:57.040
but the cause is not yet clear.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.760
I fucking hate him for it.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.840
The past is immutable, Stefan.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.800
No matter how painful it is,
we can't change things,

19:10.880 --> 19:13.800
we can't choose differently,
with hindsight.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.840
We all have to learn to accept that.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.280
Remember, any time you need me,
just pick up the phone.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.240
You know the number.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.040
♪ Hush, hush, eye to eye ♪

19:34.280 --> 19:36.280
♪ Too shy, shy ♪

19:36.680 --> 19:38.120

20:46.920 --> 20:47.840
Thank you.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.520
Stefan?

22:47.520 --> 22:49.320
Um, tea.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.520
Er, look, I'm going to go to the pub
for some lunch.

22:55.760 --> 22:59.440
- If you fancy tagging along.
- No. I'm alright.

23:01.160 --> 23:05.680
- You didn't have any breakfast.
- Dad, I'm fine.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.160
Is everything alright?

23:15.560 --> 23:18.840
Stefan, I'm worried about you.
You've been stuck in your room for weeks.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.080
Stefan?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.200
Will you talk to me?

23:32.680 --> 23:34.960
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

23:39.800 --> 23:42.680
Stefan, what the hell are you doing?
That's all your work!

24:18.600 --> 24:20.040
Is everything alright?

24:26.360 --> 24:29.800
Stefan, I'm worried about you.
You've been stuck in your room for weeks.

24:36.720 --> 24:37.720
Stefan?

24:38.800 --> 24:39.960
Will you talk to me?

24:44.600 --> 24:46.880
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

24:46.960 --> 24:48.720
Dad, just fuck off!

24:55.320 --> 24:56.480
I'm sorry.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.760
I'm... I'm just...

25:00.040 --> 25:02.240
- I'm-I'm just stressed.
- Get your coat.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.760
We're going for lunch.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.440
- Dad. I need to finish this.
- And we'll go in the car.

25:12.640 --> 25:16.040
♪ We're only making plans for Nigel ♪

25:18.920 --> 25:22.880
♪ We only want what's best for him ♪

25:31.160 --> 25:32.360
We're here.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.200
This is Dr. Haynes' place.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.720
- You said we were getting lunch.
- You need to speak to her.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.880
You're under pressure, you're...

25:56.960 --> 25:59.520
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.480
I'm concerned about you, OK?

26:03.920 --> 26:09.080
I think the healthiest thing to do
is to talk about any concerns you may have

26:09.160 --> 26:11.400
instead of bottling them up inside.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.680
Don't know if it's the deadlines,
but my head is all over the place.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.160
I keep having these vivid dreams.
Like thinking weird things.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.480
What sort of things?

26:27.600 --> 26:30.160
- Like I'm not in control.
- Of?

26:30.840 --> 26:34.240
Anything, little things, tiny decisions.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.720
What I have for breakfast in the morning.
What music I listen to.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.600
Whether I shout at Dad, or...

26:38.680 --> 26:40.760
You feel like you're not making
these decisions?

26:42.200 --> 26:44.680
I feel like I'm not guiding them.
Like someone else is.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.520
You're not hearing voices or...?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.880
No voices, but there is something.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.080
I-I don't know, an impulse.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.480
I'm sure there is.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.960
OK. The fact that you're aware
of your mental state

26:59.040 --> 27:01.320
is actually reassuring.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.440
But it sounds like you're starting
to dissociate

27:04.520 --> 27:05.960
so we want to nip that in the bud

27:06.040 --> 27:09.640
before you start
to seriously entertain delusions.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.600
I don't think we're there yet though.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.040
We can't overlook the fact

27:14.120 --> 27:17.240
that the anniversary
of your mother's death is due,

27:17.720 --> 27:20.120
and as we know, that's a stressor.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.840
Ah!

27:33.240 --> 27:34.200
With that in mind,

27:34.280 --> 27:36.960
I think it's important that you stay
on the pharmaceutical path

27:37.040 --> 27:38.360
at least for the next few months.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.280
I'm upping the dosage slightly.

27:43.800 --> 27:44.960
Stefan.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.080
Don't see this as a setback.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.280
You're not alone. We're in it together.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.640
One for all, and all...

27:56.880 --> 27:57.840
For one.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.040
If anything happens, just call me.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.320
You know the number.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.520
- How was it?
- It was fine.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.800
So, Bandersnatch. Worth it?

29:34.880 --> 29:38.280
I wish I could say yes
but it's frustrating.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.600
It's as if the creator simply gave up
halfway through and went on autopilot.

29:42.920 --> 29:46.280
If we had second chances in life,
I'd hope they'd choose differently

29:46.360 --> 29:48.440
but, er, sadly we don't.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.320
And nor do they. If that makes sense?

29:51.400 --> 29:54.080
- So your verdict?
- Two and a half stars out of five.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.360
Disappointing.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.520
Oh, dear. Well, maybe next week

29:57.600 --> 29:59.800
we'll have something more
to float your boat, Robin.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.080
I should try again.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.680
I'm concerned about you, OK?

30:12.520 --> 30:14.200
You need to speak to her.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.600
I'm concerned about you, OK?

30:20.400 --> 30:22.040
You need to speak to her.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.320
I'm concerned about you, OK?

30:28.240 --> 30:29.880
You need to speak to her.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.240
I'm concerned about you, OK?

31:49.520 --> 31:50.720
Looking good.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.840
Good job I doubled the advertising.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.400
That's not...

31:58.480 --> 32:01.480
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.360
- It was, I just--
- Just what?

32:04.120 --> 32:07.440
- Did you add a new path?
- The government conspiracy branch.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.000
One of the alternate timelines
in the novel.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.480
Jerome F. Davies
was into his conspiracy theories.

32:12.560 --> 32:16.040
- Before or after he went psycho?
- I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.800
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

32:18.880 --> 32:22.200
- No, it's important.
- Stefan, mate. The deadline is today.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.240
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path in.

32:24.320 --> 32:27.760
- Oh, it's complicated enough.
- Just the weekend. Please.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.120
- First thing Monday.
- First thing.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.240
Okay.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.160
Shit, I've got to run,
meeting the John Menzies guys.

32:37.560 --> 32:41.720
Just don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

32:41.800 --> 32:42.800
I know.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.880
Here. That's for you.

32:50.720 --> 32:51.720
What is it?

32:51.800 --> 32:54.600
Taped it off the telly.
Documentary about Jerome.

32:54.840 --> 32:58.160
A bit of inspiration maybe.
Pop it on while you work.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.400
Are you having a film night?

33:35.000 --> 33:36.960
Sugar Puffs from Quaker.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.480
Tell them about the honey, yummy.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.960
Towards the end of his life,

33:46.040 --> 33:50.320
Davies was apparently self-administering
hallucinogens on a daily basis.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.680
This, coupled with his attempts

33:52.760 --> 33:55.880
to complete the complex multiple
narratives of Bandersnatch

33:55.960 --> 33:58.080
was to prove the final straw.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.840
He became obsessed
with bizarre symbols

34:00.920 --> 34:03.280
and the limitations
of his own free will.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.400
In his notes,
Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph

34:07.480 --> 34:12.840
which to him represented multiple fates,
potential realities splitting in two.

34:13.679 --> 34:17.719
It was the start
of his complete mental collapse.

34:17.840 --> 34:21.239
Davies became convinced
he had no control over his fate

34:21.320 --> 34:24.639
because his wife was spiking him
with psychoactive drugs

34:24.719 --> 34:29.159
at behest of a demon called Pax,
a sort of lion figure

34:29.440 --> 34:31.679
who he claimed he'd seen in a vision,

34:31.760 --> 34:33.800
and who ended up
being incorporated into the book.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.239
It was this that led him to kill her.

34:40.040 --> 34:44.639
He decapitated her and daubed the
glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.840
After his arrest, he told police

34:48.920 --> 34:52.280
we exist within
multiple parallel realities at once.

34:53.520 --> 34:57.720
One reality for each possible course
of action we might take in life.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.720
Whatever we choose to do
in this existence,

35:00.800 --> 35:04.000
thereâ€™s another one out there
in which weâ€™re doing quite the opposite,

35:04.080 --> 35:08.920
which renders free will meaningless.
Nothing but an illusion.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.760
If you follow that line of thinking
to its logical conclusion...

35:16.920 --> 35:18.360
...they're not even your actions.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.640
Your fate has been dictated,
it's out of your hands.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.480
- You're just a puppet.
- Shh, shh, shh.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.640
You're not in control.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.760
I'm concerned about you, OK?

35:38.680 --> 35:40.320
You need to speak to her.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.520
I'm concerned about you, OK?

35:46.520 --> 35:48.160
You need to speak to her.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.400
I'm concerned about you, OK?

35:54.360 --> 35:56.000
You need to speak to her.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.240
I'm concerned about you, OK?

36:01.800 --> 36:05.080
Davies became convinced
he had no control over his fate

36:05.160 --> 36:08.720
because his wife was spiking him
with psychoactive drugs.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.160
It was this that led him to kill her.

36:11.960 --> 36:16.480
He decapitated her and daubed the
glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.440
After his arrest, he told police

36:18.520 --> 36:22.640
we exist within
multiple parallel realities at once.

36:23.040 --> 36:27.360
One reality for each possible course
of action we might take in life.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.040
Whatever we choose to do
in this existence,

36:30.120 --> 36:33.640
thereâ€™s another one out there
in which weâ€™re doing quite the opposite.

36:39.680 --> 36:43.360
If you follow that line of thinking
to its logical conclusion,

36:43.440 --> 36:46.160
then you're absolved of any guilt
from your actions.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.680
But they're not even your actions.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.920
It's out of your control.

36:54.280 --> 36:57.800
Your fate has been dictated,
it's out of your hands.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.920
So, why not commit murder?

37:03.320 --> 37:04.640
Maybe that's what destiny wants.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.320
You're just a puppet.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.280
You're not in control.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.680
Stefan?

38:51.240 --> 38:53.840
Yes, and so what, Rabbit's a toy.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.680
A baby's toy that he takes everywhere.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.600
He's five.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.840
And by five,
he should've stopped playing with dolls.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.000
- It's not a doll.
- If he takes it to your parents,

39:01.080 --> 39:03.480
I'm going to have to withstand
another lecture from your dad

39:03.560 --> 39:05.600
- about permissive child-rearing.
- Oh, for God's sake.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.120
I'm sorry, look,
I am going to do something about this.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.440
No!

40:19.040 --> 40:20.400
Who's doing this to me?

40:21.040 --> 40:22.520
I know there's someone there.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.240
Who's there?

40:26.440 --> 40:27.720
Who are you?

40:30.200 --> 40:32.080
Just give me a sign.

40:33.560 --> 40:36.000
Come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.440
Will you give me a sign?

40:37.920 --> 40:41.280
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.600
Fucking hell.

40:57.960 --> 41:01.440
Who... What the fuck is Netflix?

41:08.640 --> 41:10.280
Seriously, what does that mean?

41:23.840 --> 41:26.880
I don't know what that means.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.760
You're not making any sense.
Can you make sense?

41:51.320 --> 41:53.440
I don't understand. I-I don't understand.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.240
Who are you talking to?

41:58.960 --> 41:59.880
It'll sound crazy.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.240
Well, tell me anyway.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.600
I'm being controlled by someone
from the future.

42:09.040 --> 42:09.880
What?

42:10.480 --> 42:14.000
I'm being controlled
by someone from the future.

42:16.720 --> 42:19.600
- Shall I ring Dr. Haynes?
- Yes, please.

42:28.440 --> 42:33.160
So, you're being controlled
by someone on Netflix.

42:33.480 --> 42:37.800
- What is Netflix? Is it a planet?
- I don't know, it...

42:38.160 --> 42:41.600
It's some sort
of future entertainment thing.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.280
- Like a computer game?
- I don't know.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.680
It's from the 21st Century, they said.

42:49.240 --> 42:52.400
OK, well,
let's try to pick it apart logically,

42:52.480 --> 42:56.160
to see if we can define
if this is reality or delusion.

42:56.440 --> 42:59.720
- It's not a delusion.
- OK, let's go through it.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.200
OK.

43:02.360 --> 43:08.120
So all of this is happening
to entertain someone.

43:08.400 --> 43:10.560
- Someone who's controlling you.
- Uh-huh.

43:12.280 --> 43:16.240
So why aren't you
in a more entertaining scenario?

43:18.880 --> 43:21.440
- What do you mean?
- Well, look at you.

43:21.960 --> 43:25.440
You're in a small ordinary room,
in an ordinary part of the world,

43:25.520 --> 43:27.480
talking to an ordinary woman.

43:28.960 --> 43:33.400
If this was entertainment,
surely you'd make it more interesting.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.320
Inject a little action, isn't that right?

43:38.160 --> 43:42.600
I mean, wouldn't you want
a little more action

43:42.680 --> 43:45.440
if you were watching this now on telly?

44:04.760 --> 44:09.480
Come at me. Come on, mummy's boy.
What are you waiting for?

44:16.920 --> 44:19.200
Come on. I dare you.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.240
Cut!

44:25.720 --> 44:29.080
Sorry, are you OK?

44:30.520 --> 44:31.640
Two sugars.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.160
I-I was, er...

44:37.480 --> 44:38.640
Window.

44:39.520 --> 44:40.560
Window.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.920
I was trying to open the window.
To jump out.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.640
You don't jump out.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.120
You can't jump out. It doesn't open, look.

44:48.200 --> 44:51.400
You're not scripted to jump out,
see, Mike?

44:52.240 --> 44:53.920
It's the fight scene now.

44:57.920 --> 44:58.920
Mike?

45:01.440 --> 45:02.440
Mike?

45:03.760 --> 45:05.800
Er... Stefan.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.160
Do you want to sit down for a moment?

45:11.800 --> 45:14.120
Can we get the medic down here please?

45:22.560 --> 45:24.200
You need to speak to her.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.520
I'm concerned about you, OK?

45:30.280 --> 45:31.960
You need to speak to her.

45:34.040 --> 45:36.280
I'm concerned about you, OK?

45:38.120 --> 45:39.800
You need to speak to her.

45:41.800 --> 45:44.000
I'm concerned about you, OK?

45:46.040 --> 45:47.680
You need to speak to her.

45:49.560 --> 45:50.560
I'm concerned about...

45:54.600 --> 45:57.120
- Motown for computer games.
- Colin Ritman?

45:58.480 --> 46:00.200
- We've met before.
- What's your answer?

46:00.280 --> 46:01.600
Bit of madness is what you need.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.920
Stefan, will you talk to me?

46:04.000 --> 46:05.560
Dad, just fuck off!

46:06.560 --> 46:07.680
Get your coat.

46:08.680 --> 46:09.920
This is Dr. Haynes' place.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.640
You need to speak to her.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.080
You're under pressure.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.560
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.600
Stefan, come back.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.640
Stefan!

46:25.440 --> 46:26.440
Colin.

46:28.520 --> 46:29.360
Hi.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.200
How's Bandersnatch going?

46:34.280 --> 46:35.240
Not good.

46:36.080 --> 46:38.880
Not good. I'm just... lost.

46:40.560 --> 46:43.040
- You're in the hole.
- In the what?

46:43.120 --> 46:46.640
- In a fight with your own head.
- Yes. That's exactly it.

46:47.520 --> 46:51.800
- You got anywhere to be later?
- Er, well, no.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.440
Come with me.

47:25.280 --> 47:27.120
Stefan, this is Kitty.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.160
And this is Pearl.

47:34.720 --> 47:36.280
Daddy's little legacy.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.840
Stefan's in the hole, Kit.

47:43.320 --> 47:44.200
Poor thing.

47:45.880 --> 47:47.320
Are you going to get him out?

47:48.360 --> 47:49.360
Mm-hm.

48:04.720 --> 48:05.920
Grab a pew.

48:33.800 --> 48:34.760
Here.

48:36.360 --> 48:39.200
- Oh. I haven't ever really--
- Come on.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.880
You'll get the hang of that.

49:14.960 --> 49:16.320
One for you...

49:16.720 --> 49:17.960
One for me.

49:19.960 --> 49:23.200
- What is it?
- It lets you see the bigger picture.

49:24.640 --> 49:27.720
- I-I don't know.
- It'll help you understand.

49:29.360 --> 49:30.480
Do you want it?

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
It's your choice.

49:35.640 --> 49:38.400
Totally up to you. Don't feel pressured.

49:47.400 --> 49:48.360
Yes.

49:56.400 --> 49:57.440
Do this.

50:17.840 --> 50:18.680
Now what?

50:19.880 --> 50:21.440
Now we just wait a bit.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.360
People think there's one reality

51:19.440 --> 51:21.720
but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots.

51:21.800 --> 51:24.440
And what we do on one path
affects what happens on the other paths.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.320
Time is a construct.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.200
People think you can't go back
and change things,

51:28.640 --> 51:30.920
but you can, that's what flashbacks are,

51:31.040 --> 51:33.840
they're invitations to go back
and make different choices.

51:33.920 --> 51:36.960
When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.800
It's the spirit out there
that's connected to our world

51:39.880 --> 51:41.600
that decides what we do

51:41.680 --> 51:44.200
and we just have to go along for the ride.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.240
Mirrors let you move through time.

51:47.720 --> 51:48.960
The government monitors people,

51:49.560 --> 51:51.560
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives

51:52.040 --> 51:54.760
and they put drugs in your food
and they film you.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.040
There's messages in every game.

51:57.120 --> 51:59.760
Like Pac-Man.
Do you know what PAC stands for?

52:00.680 --> 52:03.000
P-A-C: "Program and Control."

52:03.080 --> 52:06.920
He's Program and Control Man,
the whole thing's a metaphor,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.040
he thinks he's got free will
but really he's trapped in a maze,

52:10.120 --> 52:12.200
in a system, all he can do is consume,

52:12.280 --> 52:14.600
he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head,

52:14.960 --> 52:17.680
and even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze,

52:17.760 --> 52:20.120
what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.000
People think it's a happy game,

52:22.080 --> 52:25.200
it's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world

52:25.280 --> 52:27.520
and the worst thing is
it's real and we live in it.

52:27.840 --> 52:28.680
It is all code.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.560
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

52:33.200 --> 52:37.920
There's a cosmic flowchart that dictates
where you can and where you can't go.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.160
I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

52:44.440 --> 52:45.560
Do you understand?

52:47.800 --> 52:48.720
Maybe.

52:50.240 --> 52:51.960
Yes. Sort of.

52:52.320 --> 52:56.040
I'll show you what I mean. Come with me.

53:04.760 --> 53:06.440
We're on one path.

53:07.080 --> 53:08.680
Right now, me and you.

53:09.560 --> 53:12.160
And how one path ends is immaterial.

53:12.240 --> 53:18.080
It's how our decisions along that path
affect the whole that matters.

53:18.760 --> 53:20.000
Do you believe me?

53:20.960 --> 53:23.520
I don't know.

53:24.240 --> 53:25.280
I'll prove it.

53:26.120 --> 53:29.520
One of us is going over.

53:30.800 --> 53:31.840
Over there.

53:36.160 --> 53:37.320
You'd die. You'd die.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.200
It wouldn't matter
because there are other timelines, Stefan.

53:42.880 --> 53:45.200
How many times
have you watched Pac-Man die?

53:45.640 --> 53:47.000
Doesn't bother him.

53:48.480 --> 53:49.920
He just tries again.

53:50.800 --> 53:54.520
One of us is jumping,
so who's it going to be?

54:00.040 --> 54:01.720
It's a nice breeze up here.

54:05.080 --> 54:09.080
So, come on, which one of us is jumping?

54:15.120 --> 54:16.080
I'll do it.

54:16.880 --> 54:17.840
I like your style.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.800
Oh! Oh!

55:02.800 --> 55:06.320
So, Robin, Bandersnatch, any good?

55:06.400 --> 55:09.200
This is hard to say,
because as you may know,

55:09.280 --> 55:12.040
the original author of this game
was killed in a tragic accident.

55:12.120 --> 55:14.960
- Indeed.
- But it's just not a good game.

55:15.040 --> 55:19.240
It seems someone else finished it off
quickly but it's just abrupt and jarring.

55:19.320 --> 55:23.320
And unnecessary, and horrible,
and violent, unsettling, and weird,

55:23.400 --> 55:27.720
and awful, and scary, and dark,
and bleak and creepy...

55:31.280 --> 55:35.560
The healthiest thing to do
is to talk about any concerns you may have

55:35.800 --> 55:38.040
instead of bottling them up inside.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.440
You need to speak to her.

55:40.520 --> 55:44.840
The healthiest thing to do
is to talk about any concerns you may have

55:45.120 --> 55:47.360
instead of bottling them up inside.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.720
You need to speak to her.

55:49.840 --> 55:54.120
The healthiest thing to do
is to talk about any concerns you may have

55:54.400 --> 55:56.600
instead of bottling them up inside.

55:57.360 --> 55:59.000
You need to speak to her.

56:00.040 --> 56:02.360
How many times
have you watched Pac-Man die?

56:02.800 --> 56:04.160
Doesn't bother him.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.080
He just tries again.

56:07.960 --> 56:11.600
One of us is jumping,
so who's it going to be?

56:17.200 --> 56:18.920
It's a nice breeze up here.

56:22.240 --> 56:26.240
So, come on, which one of us is jumping?

56:31.400 --> 56:32.320
You do it.

56:33.760 --> 56:34.600
Fair enough.

56:38.680 --> 56:40.040
See you around.

56:52.960 --> 56:53.880
Where's Colin?

57:08.880 --> 57:09.840
We're here.

57:12.840 --> 57:16.720
- Colin jumped and I didn't stop him.
- Stefan...

57:17.640 --> 57:20.320
maybe you're not well.

57:21.040 --> 57:22.880
Go and speak to Dr. Haynes.

57:24.160 --> 57:25.160
Please.

57:27.960 --> 57:28.800
Alright.

57:30.680 --> 57:31.760
What sort of things?

57:31.840 --> 57:33.960
What I have for breakfast.
What music I listen to.

57:34.040 --> 57:35.480
Whether I bite my fucking nails.

57:35.560 --> 57:38.200
- You feel you're not...
- Making these decisions, no,

57:38.280 --> 57:40.280
and we've talked about this before.
I'm sure we have.

57:40.360 --> 57:43.160
And you tell me I feel guilty about my mum
and you up my dose.

57:43.240 --> 57:45.520
And, yes, I am taking my medication, OK?

57:46.160 --> 57:48.280
So just write me the fucking prescription.

58:00.120 --> 58:03.760
We can't dupe them fast enough.
Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

58:04.040 --> 58:05.800
- Where is Colin?
- He's gone AWOL.

58:05.880 --> 58:07.960
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam
for a spot of gardening,

58:08.040 --> 58:09.720
if you know what I mean.
He'll be back, he always is.

58:11.600 --> 58:12.880
Mate. This is due today.

58:12.960 --> 58:15.040
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path.

58:15.120 --> 58:18.400
Don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

58:18.480 --> 58:19.320
I know.

58:22.120 --> 58:26.520
Er... Colin wanted me to give you this.
To inspire you.

58:27.440 --> 58:30.640
Davies became convinced
he had no control over his fate.

58:30.720 --> 58:34.720
If you follow that line of thinking
to its logical conclusion,

58:34.800 --> 58:37.360
then you're absolved of any guilt
from your actions.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.560
But they're not even your actions.

58:39.960 --> 58:41.520
It's out of your control.

58:41.920 --> 58:43.720
Your fate has been dictated.

58:44.240 --> 58:45.840
So, why not commit murder?

58:47.280 --> 58:48.760
You're not in control.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.840
Who's doing this to me?

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.800
I know there's someone there.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.920
Who's there? Who are you?

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.280
Just give me a sign.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.280
Oh, come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.720
Will you give me a sign?

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.600
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.800
Stefan?

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.240
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.920
Stefan, you're worrying me.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.880
- I'm not in control. I'm not in control.
- What are you talking about? Stefan?

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.440
- I'm being controlled.
- Stefan! Stefan? Stop it. OK?

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.720
Look, you need to calm down.
Just take a breath, please and calm down.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.680
In through your nose. Breathe.
Breathe in through the nose and out.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.080
Breathe in, Stefan. And out.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.040
Calm, Stefan.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.640
Get away from me! Please, Dad.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.480
Dad, just stay away from me.
I'm not in control.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.720
- Stefan, please.
- Dad, please get away from me.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.000
I'm not in control.
Please, I'm not in control.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.360
- Stefan.
- I'm not in control.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.000
What do I do?

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960
What do I do?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:29.840
OK.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.520
- Hello?
- The man himself, the whiz kid.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.440
How's it going?

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.560
- How's it going?
- Listen.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.120
Colin's still off exploring
other dimensions.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.760
He can't bail me out so I need the code.
First thing Monday you said.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.200
The ads are out,
I've booked the dupe plants.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.600
There's some serious cash down
the swanny if you don't deliver.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.480
I need it by the end of today.
That possible?

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.400
Stefan?

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.120
Hello? Spit it out.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.720
Before I evolve.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.320
Will it be ready by the end of the day?

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.360
- Of course.
- Good.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.280
By the end of today, no later. Tatty bye.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.720
Where's Colin? Where is he?

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.320
- Where... where is he?
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Can I help?

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.720
- It's Colin's girlfriend.
- Kitty. We've met before.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.880
When you had blue hair.
Satpal, I'll deal with this.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.080
- Where's Colin?
- I thought you'd tell me.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.520
He's gone, he's just gone.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.920
Tell me about it
but he's done this before.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.800
Not like this. When did you see him last?

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.880
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.440
Who's Stefan?

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.240
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.200
Who is Stefan?

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.520
Are you Stefan?

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.040
Yes. We... we've met before.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.480
No, we haven't.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.160
Do you know where Colin is?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.280
Er...

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.040
I was in the office and Satpal
said you'd seen him last.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.360
If you know where he is, please tell me.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.200
No, I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.680
I don't know anything about anything.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.080
Right.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.960
Well, if you hear from Colin,
tell him to ring Kitty.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:20.920
OK. I've got to go.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.000
And that's why futurologists believe

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.000
you'll be able to play
the games of the future anywhere.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.760
On a bus, or the tube,
in the palm of your hand.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.880
- Crispin?
- Thanks, Leslie.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.600
Now yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:48.000
games company Tuckersoft
announced it's going into liquidation.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.040
So what went wrong?

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.880
Just six months ago,
Tuckersoft was riding high,

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.320
with a string of hits topping the charts

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.360
and mounting anticipation for their
big Christmas release, Bandersnatch.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.040
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.680
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.920
19-year-old Stefan Butler,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.280
who stands accused
of murdering his father,

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.400
following a psychological breakdown.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.240
This has raised questions about
the judgement of Tuckersoft boss,

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.880
Mohan Thakur.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.200
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.080
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.960
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul, but I'm a victim too.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.760
Let's try to not forget that.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.320
But there's another Tuckersoft
protÃ©gÃ© at the centre of a mystery.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.400
Famed programmer Colin Ritman
is still missing,

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.320
having vanished without trace
shortly before the killings.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.200
At the trial,
Butler denied any involvement

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.400
in Ritman's sudden disappearance,

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.880
claiming he had seen Ritman
committing suicide in a vision.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.200
Today,
Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.280
And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.359
What do I do?

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.880
What do I do?

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.359
How many times have you
watched Pac-Man die?

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:42.120
Doesn't bother him. He just tries again.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.560
Colin Ritman.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.399
- We've met before.
- No.

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:52.479
We met before. I told you
I'd see you around. And I was right.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.279
We're going to be late.
Are you coming or not?

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:57.760
- No!
- The 8:45 derailed...

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.319
Fuck off! I'm not in control.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.359
- We're in it together.
- The deadline is today.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:04.640
- I just need the weekend.
- Bit of inspiration maybe.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.640
You're just a puppet.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.279
So, why not commit murder?

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.319
Just give me a fucking sign!

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:12.279
Stefan?

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:28.399
What do I do?

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.399
Oh, God, really?

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:52.479
Dr. Haynes' office.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:57.120
- Is Dr. Haynes there?
- No. She's with a client right now.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.680
Would you like to make an appointment?
I could fit you in...

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.440
first thing tomorrow.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.120
Yes.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.040
- And your name is?
- Stefan Butler.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.600
He's fucking engaged.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.720
He's probably taken the phone
off the hook.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.400
- That's what I do.
- That's what you do, is it?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.880
I'll remember that.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.920
Look, just let him be.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.040
- He's probably in the zone.
- OK. I'll give him another 24 hours.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.320
And how is your father?

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.560
He's visiting his sister.
She's in the South of France, so...

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.680
So you've been left to your own devices.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.600
Mm-hm.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.640
It's been good actually.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.920
Not having him.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.240
It's meant I could work
with a real sense of purpose.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.080
I've actually had a bit of breakthrough
with the game.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.440
I think I'd got bogged down before
but now I can see.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.120
So you finally finished it?

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.160
Finished, delivered, everything.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.840
I'd been trying to give the player
too much choice.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.800
So I just went back
and stripped loads out.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.000
And now they've got the illusion
of free will, but really...

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.080
I decide the ending.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.560
And is it a happy ending?

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.080
I think so.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920
Then that's great.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.560
So Bandersnatch? Yes or no?

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.880
Yes, yes, and yes.
It's got all the bases covered.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.120
The perfect game.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.560
Well, that is a first.
So your rating is...

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.320
My rating is five stars out of five.
Magnificent.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.760
That was the game Bandersnatch
being reviewed on TV back in 1984.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.960
But shortly after its release,
a dark secret emerged.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.560
Its author Stefan Butler was discovered
to have murdered his own father.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.120
The game was pulled from shelves
and all the copies were pulped.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.600
Now, in a move that's bound
to cause controversy,

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.600
a new coder wants to reboot the game
for a new generation.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.000
My dad was a coder himself
back in the day,

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.320
and I found Stefan's game in an old crate,

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.600
I ran it on an emulator, RetroArch.
And I found it really ground-breaking.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.320
I can see why people think
it's controversial

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.000
to be remaking it today,

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.520
but the free will concept is fascinating.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.280
Today, interactive stories of this kind
are available on your TV, or laptop,

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.560
your phone, so I'm developing this
for streaming TV platforms.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.560
There's a rumour that platform is Netflix.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.960
I'm not allowed to talk about rumours.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.320
♪ Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it ♪

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.400
Oh, fuck!

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.160
Would you like to talk
about what happened with your mother?

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.440
I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.400
- Are you coming or not?
- No!

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.760
The 8:45 train derailed...

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.600
- He should've stopped playing with dolls.
- It's not a doll.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.760
Sorry, look, I am going to do
something about this.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.440
Stefan?

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.880
What are you doing in here?

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.120
You went looking for him.

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.040
Go on.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.520
Take him.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.120
You put him back where he belongs.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.080
Come.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.160
You don't need him.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.520
We can look for Rabbit tomorrow.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.240
Found him!

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.440
Great!

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.440
OK, well, we're going to miss the 8:30.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.960
We'll have to take the 8:45.
Should be fine.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.520
Well, are you coming?

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.760

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.640
He's dead.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.440
I don't understand.
He was just sitting there.

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.720
We were talking.
He closed his eyes for a few moments.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.640
He just closed his eyes.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.360
All he did was close his eyes.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.760
I'm sorry.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.200
Colin Ritman?

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.680
- We've met before.
- Fuck off!

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.200
- My head is all over the place.
- You're in the hole.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.760
The government monitors people,

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.880
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.200
and they put drugs in your food.

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.840
Do you know what PAC stands for?
"Program and Control".

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:01.360
It's a fucking nightmare world.
It's real and we live in it.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.840
Come on, Stefan. Come on.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.760
- You can find Rabbit later.
- No!

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.080
Stefan, please come with me.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.760
No!

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.800
You weren't supposed to know.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.000
Dad, what is this?

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.880
I'm sorry.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.360
Dad, who are you?

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.120
Talk to me.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.320
Talk to me!

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.560
Who's doing this to me?

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.320
I know there's someone there.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.560
Who's there? Who are you?

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.840
Just give me a sign.

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.800
Oh, come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.200
Will you give me a sign?

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.160
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.600
What's wrong?

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.800
Stefan, what's wrong?

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.000
I know you've been controlling me.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:00.040
You and Haynes.
I know about PACS, the P.A.C.S. thing.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.280
I know you've been drugging me,
I know you've been recording me

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.560
and now you're putting messages
on my computer.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.640
Stefan, you're ill.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.600
We need to go and see Dr. Haynes
and see if she can help.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.560
I know what you've been doing to me.

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.480
I know.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.640
Remember, Stefan. Any time you need me.

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.600
You know the number.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.280
- You heard it here first.
- Get a pen.

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.960
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.960
- Too?
- Good to be true.

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:46.520
You sound like my dad.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.800
Oh.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.440
Five.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.920
You were five years old.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.520
- One for all, and all...
- For one.

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.920
Remember, Stefan.
Any time you need me.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.560
You know the number.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.520
Number? What's the number?

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.240
Two. Oh. Five.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.360
Four, one.

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.840
Remember.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:15.240
- Two. Oh. Five.
- Four, one.

01:28:34.616 --> 01:28:36.656
The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.

01:28:36.736 --> 01:28:38.496
Please check and try again.

01:28:38.576 --> 01:28:40.136
The number you have dialed has...

01:29:52.632 --> 01:29:55.312
So Bandersnatch? Yay or nay?

01:29:55.392 --> 01:29:57.352
Well, nothing in the game
is as fascinating

01:29:57.432 --> 01:29:59.672
as its grisly real-life backstory.

01:29:59.752 --> 01:30:02.552
As you know, Leslie, Stefan Butler,
the young man who wrote this,

01:30:02.632 --> 01:30:04.992
had a breakdown
and murdered his own father.

01:30:05.072 --> 01:30:05.992
Yes, very sad.

01:30:06.072 --> 01:30:08.432
And it seems the code
was never quite finished

01:30:08.512 --> 01:30:10.312
but Tuckersoft just released
the game anyway.

01:30:10.392 --> 01:30:12.352
Which I know isn't a crime
on a par with murder

01:30:12.432 --> 01:30:14.232
but it's still pretty off nonetheless.

01:30:14.312 --> 01:30:15.952
Quite. So your verdict?

01:30:16.032 --> 01:30:19.872
Two and a half stars out of five.
It's morbid curiosity value at best.

01:30:19.952 --> 01:30:21.232
Must try harder.
