00:17.540 --> 00:20.480
Mwah. Okay, baby.

00:20.740 --> 00:22.460
Oh, please, please, Evan. Don't...

00:23.710 --> 00:24.320
It's your mom.

00:24.370 --> 00:25.580
You've got to be kidding me.

00:26.380 --> 00:28.180
Okay. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

00:28.220 --> 00:31.020
This is mommy's phone.
Hi, mom. What's wrong?

00:31.070 --> 00:32.960
Why are you calling me
so early in the morning?

00:33.030 --> 00:35.470
Look, when you're in
your 60s, you don't sleep,

00:35.530 --> 00:36.750
ever. Remember that.

00:37.150 --> 00:38.850
No, it's your sister. I'm worried...

00:38.900 --> 00:40.760
do you think there's
any chance that you could

00:40.800 --> 00:43.449
stop by over there and check on her today?

00:43.450 --> 00:44.139
I'm so sorry, mom,

00:44.140 --> 00:45.610
but I can't. I'm campaigning all weekend.

00:45.611 --> 00:48.660
I'm not gonna have any time.
And... and, Robert, are you not...

00:48.700 --> 00:50.460
are you not packed? We
have to catch the bus in,

00:50.500 --> 00:52.460
- like, an hour.
- I have to take a rain check.

00:52.490 --> 00:53.890
Something came up with
the appropriations bill.

00:53.910 --> 00:55.680
And you're just telling me about this now?

00:55.710 --> 00:58.079
I woke up to a stream
of panicked e-mails.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.720
I was really looking forward
to spending some time with you.

01:00.850 --> 01:02.920
- Oh, maybe I should go with you.
- Where?

01:02.970 --> 01:04.790
Campaigning. I've never been.

01:04.849 --> 01:06.140
Mom, do you think I really need to bring

01:06.170 --> 01:08.760
my rabidly Democratic mother
on the campaign trail with me?

01:08.780 --> 01:10.490
I'm ahead in the polls right now, okay?

01:10.520 --> 01:11.890
I would like to keep it that way.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.750
You should take her. You have 16 stops.

01:13.770 --> 01:16.200
- You need somebody to play cards with.
- I play cards.

01:16.260 --> 01:17.650
- Where are we going?
- No, I'm.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.860
I'm going to a fund-raiser in Sacramento,

01:19.880 --> 01:21.860
and then I'm going to an
elementary school in Oxnard,

01:21.880 --> 01:23.560
and then I'm going to a firehouse in...

01:23.580 --> 01:25.240
- I have no idea where it is.
- I love you.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.760
Firemen? Kitty, I love firemen.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.470
Ah! I love you. Here.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.080
- How's this tie, good?
- It's... it's great.

01:33.130 --> 01:34.800
Um, honey, don't forget
about tomorrow night.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.170
Saul and Scotty are doing their

01:36.210 --> 01:38.790
- restaurant menu up in Ojai.
- Yeah, I'll be there.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.250
- Knock 'em dead.
- All right.

01:40.970 --> 01:43.990
- So... are we on?
- On? On what?

01:45.860 --> 01:47.660
- Why are you so nervous?
- I just... I just...

01:48.250 --> 01:49.360
Wow.

01:50.330 --> 01:52.190
I mean, mom said you were depressed,

01:52.240 --> 01:53.780
but eating pizza in the morning?

01:53.820 --> 01:55.720
- What, are you in college?
- Tastes good cold.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.200
- Tastes good cold!
- Oh! Get off me.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.430
Hey, Justin. What are you doing here?

01:59.530 --> 02:01.750
Uh, well, I heard dorm
girl was down in the dumps,

02:01.790 --> 02:02.920
so I came by to cheer her up.

02:02.950 --> 02:04.720
Well, I'm sorry I'm not more upbeat.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.390
Unemployment doesn't really suit me.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.880
Uh, well, you're talking to the king
of unemployment, and don't wallow.

02:09.970 --> 02:13.130
So clean the closet, write a have you
even started looking for a job yet?

02:13.190 --> 02:14.780
No one's hiring, and
even if they were hiring,

02:14.830 --> 02:17.150
they're certainly not
hiring anybody that drove

02:17.200 --> 02:18.990
their family business into the ground.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.320
Justin, she's been on the
couch for three days now.

02:21.410 --> 02:22.650
She wants to be alone.

02:23.140 --> 02:24.560
But I'm sorry. I'm not
gonna leave you alone.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.080
I will never leave you alone. 

02:27.160 --> 02:30.220
All right? So please stop
eating this leftover pizza.

02:30.370 --> 02:31.450
It's making me crazy.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.220
You want to eat something?
I'll make you an omelet.

02:34.650 --> 02:36.210
- Just one more piece.
- Sarah.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.850
I lost everything, Justin.

02:42.550 --> 02:43.270
Not everything.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.040
I mean, you still have Narrow Lake.

02:45.090 --> 02:46.720
That worthless piece of property?

02:46.750 --> 02:49.140
How tragic is it that mom, Holly and I

02:49.220 --> 02:51.309
end up joint owners of that damn place?

02:51.310 --> 02:53.050
Yeah, that's pretty tragic.
It's like the booby prize.

02:53.490 --> 02:54.220
All right. No more pizza.

02:54.270 --> 02:55.340
- You're done.
- Oh, God.

02:55.880 --> 02:59.190
- It's grossing me out.
- At least Rebecca got a job offer.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.990
Yeah, she did. So, so
much for going to Haiti.

03:03.230 --> 03:05.560
- Haiti?
- Uh, well, my college is offering a program...

03:05.600 --> 03:07.340
Where we go down to Haiti
and help out for a year.

03:07.370 --> 03:10.040
- And I'd actually get full credit.
- Wow. A year?

03:10.840 --> 03:13.290
Hello. That's kind of a long
time to be apart, don't you think?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.640
Yeah. But she didn't take the job yet,

03:14.690 --> 03:16.410
so I was actually trying to
convince her to come with me.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.900
It's not like I'm gonna be
in a library the whole time.

03:17.940 --> 03:19.930
I mean, I'm down there
helping out people, you know?

03:20.060 --> 03:23.430
Hey, more good news. Ahem.
Your mom is coming over.

03:28.650 --> 03:30.930
Oh, Saul... Saul, these peaches...

03:30.970 --> 03:32.810
you can't get anything like that in L.A.

03:32.950 --> 03:35.820
Wow. Are you sure we're
gonna be ready in a month?

03:35.870 --> 03:38.410
Well, we may not be
firing on all four burners,

03:38.460 --> 03:40.600
- but we'll be serving food.
- Oh! I found

03:40.700 --> 03:43.740
a really great day care
center in the neighborhood.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.290
Why can't we have the baby
with us in the restaurant?

03:46.320 --> 03:48.040
Well, sometimes, but not always.

03:49.670 --> 03:51.480
- A baby!
- A baby!

03:51.700 --> 03:54.080
Oh, did we wake you? 

03:54.290 --> 03:56.230
What, with all the banging, the clanging,

03:56.260 --> 03:58.760
the Olivia Newton-John
playing? No, absolutely not.

03:58.850 --> 04:01.150
I'm so glad we rented the old Ojai house

04:01.180 --> 04:03.060
for some peace and quiet this weekend.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.290
Well, we're not here for peace and quiet.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.610
Your whole family's coming tomorrow.

04:05.780 --> 04:09.590
- You made a menu.
- Yep, it's a test menu.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.920
We want everyone's opinion
on how everything tastes.

04:11.970 --> 04:15.230
- Oh, so it's an oral exam?
- Wait till you see the amazing recipes

04:15.260 --> 04:16.940
- we're gonna make.
- I feel bloated already.

04:16.970 --> 04:19.120
Okay, Kevin, if you're not
gonna help, out of the kitchen.

04:19.170 --> 04:20.430
- Inside voice, please.
- I never

04:20.459 --> 04:23.260
knew that my nephew was
such a grump in the morning.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.370
I never knew my uncle wore
a muumuu, so we're even.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.520
It's not a muumuu. It's a nightshirt.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.160
- Where... do you know where my...
- Yeah.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.590
Hey, Kit. Saul's wearing a muumuu.

04:36.630 --> 04:39.180
- Says the man in the sleeping mask.
- How's my senator-to-be?

04:39.210 --> 04:41.360
Oh, cautiously optimistic.

04:41.420 --> 04:44.330
- What, about the primary?
- No, about me and mom on a bus.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.610
I... I somehow got suckered into letting her

04:46.640 --> 04:48.960
campaign with me all weekend.
I mean, i... it could be fun,

04:49.000 --> 04:50.350
-  right?
- I'm sor... mom,

04:50.380 --> 04:53.850
the most vocal bleeding-heart
liberal in southern California?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.670
No. That's not fun.
That's campaign suicide.

04:55.710 --> 04:57.720
Oh, I was so hoping you
weren't gonna say that.

04:57.770 --> 04:58.700
Whoo-hoo! Kitty!

04:59.120 --> 05:01.060
- She brought Sarah.
- Sarah's not exactly the person

05:01.100 --> 05:02.340
I'd want cheering for me right now.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.360
No, she looks like
somebody killed her cat.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.010
Oh, I... I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

05:06.650 --> 05:10.630
- Surprise. You've got the both of us.
- Yeah. Hey. Hi, Sarah.

05:10.670 --> 05:13.450
- Hi. Does this thing have a TV?
- Uh... yeah.

05:14.780 --> 05:15.870
What the hell are you thinking?

05:15.900 --> 05:18.190
She was doing nothing but eating pizza

05:18.220 --> 05:19.420
and watching soap operas.

05:19.450 --> 05:21.570
Mom, this is not a bus to Vegas, okay?

05:21.610 --> 05:23.420
Well, I... I have some
serious campaigning to do.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.420
- Where's the remote?
- Um, ch...

05:25.610 --> 05:26.750
Oh, never mind. Got it.

05:27.220 --> 05:30.770
You see? She's better
already. It's gonna be fine.

05:30.900 --> 05:31.770
Come on, honey.

05:32.970 --> 05:36.290
Look at this. I just got
another friend request.

05:36.340 --> 05:37.860
Saul just discovered Facebook.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.680
Ooh. Hot. Old flame?

05:39.860 --> 05:42.900
Well, we had a little moment,
but that was years ago.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.710
Oh, look. He's a big A.I.D.S. activist.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.570
It says he's been living with
A.I.D.S. For the last 22 years.

05:49.830 --> 05:51.400
Oh, he does those
bike-a-thons and everything.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.500
- That's pretty remarkable.
- I did a bike-a-thon.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.360
I raised 1,500 bucks, and
then I had to spend 1,500 bucks

05:56.410 --> 05:58.040
- on my own chiropractor.
- Oh, that reminds me.

05:58.060 --> 05:59.340
You have your physical next week.

05:59.390 --> 06:01.340
- Oh, yeah.
- Do you two still get tested?

06:01.400 --> 06:05.150
For h.I.V.? Yeah, of course.
It's sort of like habit now.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.880
- You know, it's sex spring cleaning.
- Yeah,

06:06.920 --> 06:08.920
and you never know where this
one's been tramping around.

06:08.970 --> 06:11.340
- Exactly.
- What do you mean, "exactly"?

06:13.750 --> 06:14.510
What about you, Saul?

06:14.550 --> 06:16.320
What, me, tested?

06:16.400 --> 06:19.380
Oh, what... what for? I'm 100 years old.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.410
Anyway, I haven't had sex
since the "Hindenburg" exploded.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.540
No, the only thing about me
that gets tested is my patience.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.580
Now come on.

06:26.770 --> 06:29.850
We have recipes to cook.
We have meals to make.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.070
Listen, we have enough to hang this guy.

06:35.450 --> 06:38.850
Stanton's been buying votes to win
highly inflated defense contracts.

06:38.900 --> 06:41.270
He is getting rich on
the backs of our soldiers.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.420
You think that I don't know that?

06:42.470 --> 06:43.780
Then why hang on to the tapes?

06:44.070 --> 06:47.590
- You have him offering you money, a job...
- He threatened Kitty.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.090
The one thing I told you was,

06:49.140 --> 06:51.020
I wouldn't let this
compromise her campaign.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.470
He hasn't anything on Kitty.

06:52.510 --> 06:55.710
Then he'll make something up.
I'm already hearing this crap

06:55.770 --> 06:58.550
about Kitty using my plane
to campaign around the state.

06:58.590 --> 07:00.850
I mean, who do you think
that is? It's Stanton.

07:00.890 --> 07:02.140
Look, it is just noise. 

07:02.180 --> 07:03.960
It's the kind of noise that
drowns everything else out.

07:04.020 --> 07:06.040
And it starts with the little lies and... 

07:07.020 --> 07:08.460
then it's the big lies,
and the next thing you know,

07:08.500 --> 07:10.540
- she's destroyed.
- If you don't go public,

07:10.570 --> 07:11.800
he's getting away with murder...

07:11.950 --> 07:14.410
literally. He is out there on his own

07:14.450 --> 07:16.440
operating without any accountability,

07:16.490 --> 07:17.730
and American soldiers are dying

07:17.770 --> 07:19.780
because all he cares
about is making money.

07:19.820 --> 07:21.790
Okay, look, I told you
I'd go after this guy,

07:21.820 --> 07:23.100
and I've done my part.

07:23.220 --> 07:26.130
But I also told you, if it got
anywhere near her, I was out.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.090
He knows that we're on to him now.

07:28.870 --> 07:31.410
He's gonna be in church every
Sunday singing in the choir.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.670
Those tapes are our only shot.

07:34.490 --> 07:37.000
Now please... give them to me.

07:38.430 --> 07:39.230
I can't.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.210
I have to do this in a
way that protects my wife.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.550
I hope you have a safe place to hide them.

07:48.620 --> 07:49.730
Tapes will be safe.

Honey, you know, I think
you're doing a wonderful job.

07:57.430 --> 07:59.979
- Thank you, thank you.
- But you know this stop,

07:59.980 --> 08:02.870
maybe you should start
out with immigration reform

08:02.910 --> 08:04.250
instead of tax cuts.

08:04.300 --> 08:07.650
Last three stops, it's just been
tax cuts, ,tax cuts, tax cuts.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.730
That's because tax cuts work.
They stimulate the economy...

08:10.770 --> 08:15.270
Oh my God. They found another Farrel child in Wisconsin.

08:16.130 --> 08:19.750
- Oh wait, never mind.
- This was a really bad idea.

08:19.790 --> 08:23.640
She's gonna be fine, honestly. And
when you consider all of the options,

08:23.680 --> 08:26.330
I think watching soap operas
and reading trashy magazines

08:26.380 --> 08:28.720
is a pretty harmless
way of s self medicating.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.930
I'm not self-medicating,
mom I am grieving.

08:31.390 --> 08:32.470
There are stages.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.049
Yes, I know, honey. There are five stages.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.280
- Uh, excuse me. Can I have this for a minute?
- No!

08:37.950 --> 08:39.190
My favorite show's about to come on.

08:39.220 --> 08:40.240
Kitty, the governor's gonna be on.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.220
This is all I'm living for..

08:41.260 --> 08:42.809
- Don't let them take it away from me, Kitty.
- Sarah.

08:44.630 --> 08:45.720
Rah.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.080
Is she gonna be like this the whole time?

08:49.130 --> 08:50.970
No, no, no you have to...
you have to fix this.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.780
- Girls. Okay, girls. Stop. Just...
- Fine.

08:52.850 --> 08:54.670
Sarah, Sarah, listen to me.

08:54.940 --> 08:57.650
Honey, come on now. Come on now.

08:57.710 --> 08:59.570
We're... we're just gonna have some fun.

08:59.770 --> 09:03.180
Fun? I am stuck on a bus
in the middle of nowhere

09:03.260 --> 09:06.390
listening to my sister's
cheering, adoring fans.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.020
Not that I... I'm not happy for you.

09:08.050 --> 09:09.840
I mean, I want her to win. Honestly, I do.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.900
But I tanked my family's business. 

09:11.930 --> 09:14.730
I bet the house on Narrow
Lake. I came up dry.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.490
Let's face it. My instincts suck.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.560
Sweetheart, your instincts don't suck.

09:20.590 --> 09:22.710
Well, they do, a little.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.760
Sarah, honey, listen to me.

09:25.890 --> 09:29.820
You cannot bear the weight of Ojai
going out of business all by yourself.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.640
I'm just as responsible as you are.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.820
Does anyone know if I get carsick?

09:34.520 --> 09:36.130
Well, we're gonna find out I think.

09:38.810 --> 09:41.179
Here. She can have this back.

09:41.180 --> 09:43.430
Accounts for 12% of the entire U.S...

09:47.230 --> 09:49.100
Um... what?

09:49.460 --> 09:51.720
- It's Saul.
- Oh, he can't hear us.

09:51.780 --> 09:55.000
The walls are, like, oak.
No, it's not... it's not that.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.420
- He should get tested, Kevin.
- Oh, that.

09:57.910 --> 10:00.820
Look, he hasn't had sex since
the stone age, that poor man.

10:00.860 --> 10:01.970
He said so himself.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.780
- I heard that!
- Saul?

10:03.820 --> 10:06.290
Yes. Are you holding a glass to the wall?

10:06.550 --> 10:08.690
No, but I have my new hearing aids in.

10:08.910 --> 10:11.590
Okay, it is very sweet
for you both to care,

10:11.640 --> 10:13.770
and I really appreciate it,
but this is not a possibility.

10:13.800 --> 10:14.840
When was the last time you were tested?

10:14.870 --> 10:16.430
Would you please stop worrying about me?

10:16.470 --> 10:18.040
Let's worry about the
restaurant this weekend,

10:18.070 --> 10:20.350
- okay?
- You know, what if we all went together?

10:20.360 --> 10:22.170
- I'm sure there's a place in town we could go.
- Come on.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.620
Yeah, we could go tomorrow
out of Saul-idarity.

10:25.340 --> 10:26.630
Okay, how about this?

10:26.710 --> 10:29.040
I'll go next month when I
have my cholesterol checked.

10:29.140 --> 10:31.410
Great. Great. I'll go
with you if you want.

10:31.450 --> 10:32.610
It's okay. I'll be fine. Thank you.

10:33.890 --> 10:36.340
Oh... don't start fooling around.

10:36.390 --> 10:37.470
The walls are paper thin.

10:43.250 --> 10:44.280
Hey, thanks for coming.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.900
Uh, sure. Sure.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.650
I guess the, uh, obvious question is,

10:50.740 --> 10:52.550
what am I doing here at 11:30 at night?

10:52.650 --> 10:54.590
Hey, you didn't finish
at the hospital till now.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.600
Okay, let me rephrase.

10:56.650 --> 10:59.060
What are we doing here at 11:30 at night?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.730
I just wanted to talk to you.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.610
Um, well, I... I didn't do
anything wrong, did I?

11:04.260 --> 11:05.640
No, no, to the contrary.

11:06.350 --> 11:09.970
You're the only person
that I can trust right now.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.080
Look, we've been through
a lot. You're a soldier.

11:14.350 --> 11:15.500
That's what I need right now.

11:17.130 --> 11:19.340
- I want you to hold on to that.
- What is this?

11:19.390 --> 11:20.910
It's a key to a safe deposit box.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.610
This is the address to the bank.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.750
Now this is in both of our names,

11:24.940 --> 11:26.890
and you and I are the only
ones who know about it.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.920
- Y... you're kidding me, right?
- There's an envelope inside.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.680
And when I figure out
what I want to do with it,

11:32.720 --> 11:33.610
I'll let you know,

11:33.640 --> 11:35.520
but if something happens to me,
I want you to give it to Kitty,

11:35.810 --> 11:37.240
and she'll make the
decision on what to do.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.370
What do you mean, if
something happens to you?

11:38.410 --> 11:41.210
- Is this about your health or...
- Justin, do this for me, please.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.270
- Okay?
- Yeah.

11:45.140 --> 11:45.860
Yeah.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.840
There. That's a little more festive.

11:53.900 --> 11:58.120
Now I'm gonna turn
this light right here...

11:58.530 --> 12:00.460
Mom, mom, what... what are you doing?

12:00.500 --> 12:03.130
- I can't see anything now.
- Well, that's the point.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.230
It ain't exactly the Ritz around here.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.350
They better have cable.

12:06.410 --> 12:09.570
No, no, no. No more TV for you, Missy.

12:09.610 --> 12:11.720
You're cut off. We're doing facials.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.510
Oh, my God. We're out of wine.

12:13.740 --> 12:17.860
- Where's the mini bar?
- At the Four Seasons. Th...

12:22.100 --> 12:23.860
- Just get up. Get up.
- What? What?

12:24.630 --> 12:27.520
They never wash those
bedspreads. Get up off of there.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.890
You're liable to get some
horrible skin disease.

12:29.940 --> 12:33.380
I'd like a skin disease.
Anything just to feel again.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.480
All right, everybody, listen up.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.650
- We're gonna do facials.
- Got it.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.060
Wait a minute. Have you guys ever heard of

12:41.000 --> 12:43.540
"Citizens for a Corrupt-Free America"?

12:43.620 --> 12:45.190
No, it sounds like some horrible,

12:45.280 --> 12:47.450
right-wing, militant, gun-tot...

12:47.490 --> 12:48.430
Yeah, well, they're saying

12:48.450 --> 12:51.000
that I'm flying around
California in a private jet.

12:51.150 --> 12:53.890
Well, you... you do fly around
California in a private jet.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.630
I don't campaign in it, mother.

12:55.690 --> 12:56.589
That's what they're saying.

12:56.590 --> 12:58.180
They're saying that I campaign in it.

12:58.460 --> 13:01.510
- And I certainly don't use taxpayers' dollars to gas it up.
- Oh, no, no, no.

13:01.540 --> 13:03.180
I mean, this is outrageous.

13:03.230 --> 13:04.840
Well, Kitty, what are
you gonna do about it?

13:04.880 --> 13:06.180
Well, I'm not gonna do
anything about it, mom.

13:06.190 --> 13:08.790
- You can't fight these wackos.
- Kitty, they're lying about you.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.760
No, mom, let it go. I mean it. Please.

13:10.810 --> 13:13.820
- It's no big deal. I'm sorry I brought it up.
- Well, I... I, you know...

13:13.870 --> 13:14.560
- Mom.
- What?

13:14.590 --> 13:15.980
She said let it go. I am letting it go.

13:16.010 --> 13:19.490
All right, guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

13:19.570 --> 13:21.730
I need you to be quiet. I'm sorry.

13:21.810 --> 13:24.250
But I really have to
start working on my speech.

13:27.950 --> 13:29.380
Okay, give me the keys to the bus.

13:29.410 --> 13:30.560
I'm gonna get more liquor.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.980
No. No, you're not driving the bus.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.430
Okay, I will get a cab.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.070
You're not gonna drive anything.

13:36.180 --> 13:38.160
For goodness sakes. You know what?

13:39.020 --> 13:41.620
I'm gonna go get one of those
nice, little intern people

13:41.670 --> 13:43.480
- and have them go to the store.
- Oh, good idea.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.000
- Make sure he gets a screw top
because we don't have an opener.
- For God sakes.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.090
Don't you dare.

13:58.740 --> 13:59.610
Wait.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.010
My face feels funny.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.520
It looks funny.

14:07.170 --> 14:10.170
Oh. Did I forget to wash my mask off?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.360
Oh, my God, Sarah.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.160
You're gonna have such
tiny little pores on...

14:14.560 --> 14:15.650
on that side anyway.

14:16.210 --> 14:17.070
Oh, good.

14:18.190 --> 14:18.990
Where's mom?

14:19.300 --> 14:20.160
Don't know.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.710
Uh, my sciatica's kicking in.

14:27.570 --> 14:28.660
I don't feel good.

14:28.770 --> 14:30.830
Mom, why did you sleep on the floor?

14:30.900 --> 14:31.890
I have no idea.

14:34.690 --> 14:36.840
Oh, oh, my...

14:37.200 --> 14:39.090
right side of my body is numb.

14:43.390 --> 14:45.100
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh, God.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.130
- This place looks like a frat room.
- Mom...

14:48.240 --> 14:51.090
- What, you're kidding?
- You've got potato chips in your hair.

14:51.130 --> 14:53.700
- I'll call you back.
- Ew! Get it out! Ew.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.650
Oh, I didn't sleep one wink last night.

14:57.900 --> 15:01.370
Which one of you two girls
has a tiny little bladder?

15:01.460 --> 15:03.080
That would be the mother of two.

15:03.140 --> 15:04.070
Excuse me.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.630
Hey, mom, did you happen
to sign on the web site

15:06.660 --> 15:08.540
that was trashing me last night?

15:11.150 --> 15:13.270
Maybe just for one little minute.

15:13.660 --> 15:15.170
Oh, my God, mom.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.940
Kitty, I couldn't let
them get away with it.

15:18.010 --> 15:19.610
They... they were lying about you.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.330
- You had too much wine.
- Kitty, listen...

15:21.810 --> 15:24.380
It wasn't just the jet plane.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.790
The... they... they
started in about your wig.

15:26.830 --> 15:29.760
They said you spent thousands
and thousands of dollars

15:29.780 --> 15:32.440
and single-handedly
plucked strands of hair

15:32.470 --> 15:35.360
out of poor little orphan
girls' heads to make the wig.

15:35.410 --> 15:36.800
I had to respond.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.570
Oh, my God. You told
them how much my wig cost.

15:39.650 --> 15:41.440
I don't know how much your wig cost.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.980
Really? Because it
says right here. $4,300.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.790
- Oh, that is absurd.
- No, Sarah, it's not absurd.

15:46.830 --> 15:48.830
That's what it cost... exactly what it cost.

15:48.870 --> 15:50.140
I mean, I know it's hard to believe,

15:50.170 --> 15:52.000
but they're incredibly expensive.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.780
Well, sweetheart, you had cancer.

15:55.820 --> 15:58.590
They can't begrudge you one little wig.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.810
No, mom, you're wrong.

16:00.470 --> 16:02.560
It's either rich Kitty McCallister...

16:02.600 --> 16:04.140
out of touch, spending all this money,

16:04.170 --> 16:07.030
or it's poor Kitty McCallister...
cancer survivor, fragile.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.810
How will she ever withstand a primary
let alone a term in the Senate?

16:09.840 --> 16:13.010
No, this is coming from someone who
knows exactly what they're doing,

16:13.020 --> 16:16.630
someone who found out
precisely how much my wig cost.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.060
Well, who?

16:19.020 --> 16:20.510
That's a very good question.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.960
Okay, so you're saying if
someone is taking amiodarone,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.710
they could be suffering
from ventricular tachycardia?

16:28.020 --> 16:29.410
Wow, that's pretty serious.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.810
Um, no, no. I don't know
how long he's been taking it.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.330
Okay. Uh, well, thanks a lot, professor.

16:36.390 --> 16:38.060
And, uh, I will, uh, get back to you.

16:38.380 --> 16:39.370
All right. Thank you.

16:40.660 --> 16:41.500
What was that about?

16:41.850 --> 16:43.750
Uh, nothing. Just a... a school question.

16:45.910 --> 16:48.850
So, Justin, I've been thinking a
lot about the whole Haiti thing.

16:49.790 --> 16:53.250
And... wh... what if we
both do what we want to do?

16:54.390 --> 16:55.180
What do you mean?

16:55.290 --> 16:58.380
You go to Haiti, and... I take this job.

16:59.010 --> 17:01.210
- How would that work?
- I mean, I... I know it would be...

17:01.260 --> 17:02.990
- it would be difficult, but...
- I mean... time-out.

17:03.030 --> 17:04.430
Rebecca, like, w... we just got married.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.760
The whole point is to stay together.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.960
I took the job, Justin.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.569
- You what?
- You knew the deadline was today.

17:12.609 --> 17:14.099
Yeah, Rebecca, I didn't
think you were just gonna

17:14.119 --> 17:16.490
- take the job...
- Justin, I want this opportunity.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.760
- This is a huge step forward for me.
- So what,

17:18.790 --> 17:21.089
I'm supposed to just
go to Haiti without you?

17:21.119 --> 17:22.089
I'm trying to compromise.

17:22.130 --> 17:23.670
No, no, you're not trying to compromise.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.369
- You just made the decision for us.
- No, I did not...

17:25.400 --> 17:26.790
You know what? Fine. I'm not going.

17:27.359 --> 17:28.640
Rebecca, you know what?
You got what you wanted.

17:28.670 --> 17:30.090
At least be honest about it.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.890
So you're here for an H.I.V. test?

17:39.010 --> 17:41.890
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, why? Are you surprised?

17:42.530 --> 17:45.440
- You probably don't get many
people my age coming in here to...
- I wish we did.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.310
The over-50 set is our
fastest growing risk group.

17:48.810 --> 17:50.330
It's those performance-enhancing pills.

17:50.430 --> 17:52.060
Ah. Ah, yes.

17:52.650 --> 17:56.280
Well, the truth is, I really haven't done
anything to put myself at risk for years.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.370
So, uh...

17:57.470 --> 17:58.240
I see.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.790
I'm probably wasting
your time as well as mine.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.140
I mean, I'm in perfect health.

18:04.610 --> 18:06.760
My hearing isn't as good as it used to be,

18:06.820 --> 18:09.430
but I have these amazing
hearing aids now, and I...

18:12.560 --> 18:13.620
Let me ask you something.

18:15.340 --> 18:18.550
Is it possible for someone
to be H.I.V.-Positive

18:18.590 --> 18:21.310
for I... I don't know, let's say decades,

18:21.690 --> 18:23.140
and not know?

18:23.680 --> 18:25.190
If you're asking if you could be positive

18:25.240 --> 18:27.190
and completely asymptomatic... right.

18:27.390 --> 18:29.440
- The answer is yes.
- I see.

18:31.260 --> 18:33.140
You know, it's not
typical, but it can happen.

18:34.290 --> 18:35.140
Wow.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.510
I take it you've never been tested before.

18:37.690 --> 18:40.060
No. No, no. I... I just
never thought that I...

18:40.110 --> 18:41.370
Is there a reason for concern now?

18:43.060 --> 18:43.750
Yeah.

18:45.530 --> 18:46.430
Yeah.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.660
Uh, this friend of mine...

18:50.030 --> 18:52.100
we were together years ago...

18:55.470 --> 18:59.010
I just found out that he...
he's, uh, living with A.I.D.S.

19:00.720 --> 19:01.760
and, uh...

19:05.490 --> 19:07.700
Listen, if someone tests positive,

19:07.970 --> 19:09.670
there are all sorts of
drugs they can take now.

19:10.630 --> 19:13.090
- A person can live a long, healthy life these days.
- Good.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.920
- We could get you tested right now.
- Now?

19:15.980 --> 19:19.300
You'd know tomorrow
morning, anytime after 8:00.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.140
Good. Okay. Let's go for it.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.770
- Okay, so you dry the and I'll
start putting these eggs in.
- Yeah.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.540
Oh, Saul, did you put,
um, vinegar in that water?

19:32.580 --> 19:34.130
Yes, I put vinegar in the water.

19:34.180 --> 19:37.200
- I do know how to poach an egg.
- Okay, relax.

19:38.050 --> 19:39.710
Scotty, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to jump on you.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.040
I just... didn't sleep
very well last night.

19:43.130 --> 19:45.290
Were you thinking about what
we talked about last night?

19:45.620 --> 19:47.520
No. Because I didn't mean to pressure you.

19:47.570 --> 19:48.570
If you don't want to get tested...

19:48.600 --> 19:50.620
Could we just concentrate
on the frisÃ©e salad, please?

19:53.130 --> 19:54.670
Hey. Anything I can do to hel...

19:55.340 --> 19:56.940
- Whoa! Oh.
- Is everything okay?

19:57.340 --> 19:58.520
Listen, Rebecca, do me a favor.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.270
There are too many cooks in this kitchen.

20:00.990 --> 20:01.730
Uh, Rebecca,

20:01.780 --> 20:03.840
would you mind taking out
these empanadas for me?

20:03.920 --> 20:04.680
Definitely.

20:09.660 --> 20:10.630
How was the drive?

20:11.280 --> 20:12.970
- Oh, it wasn't bad.
- Whatever you do, don't go in the kitchen.

20:13.010 --> 20:15.200
Everybody's freaking out.
I'm gonna grab a sweater.

20:15.230 --> 20:16.190
You want one, Justin?

20:17.020 --> 20:20.280
- Justin.
- No, I would've asked. Thank you, Rebecca.

20:22.080 --> 20:22.920
Are you guys okay?

20:22.960 --> 20:25.160
We've been better. What about you?

20:25.200 --> 20:27.150
- How you feeling?
- I feel fine.

20:27.190 --> 20:29.200
What do they have you
taking these days? Taking?

20:29.240 --> 20:31.520
- For your heart, Robert.
- Atorva,

20:31.560 --> 20:33.860
which is why I'm gonna
have some more of this.

20:35.710 --> 20:36.530
Hi, guys.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.370
- How were the crowds?
- The crowds were large, friendly.

20:39.420 --> 20:43.070
Well... loud, excruciatingly loud.

20:43.430 --> 20:45.010
- Robert, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.170
- Oh, don't go in the kitchen. Saul might kill you.
- What?

20:49.330 --> 20:51.730
That's nice. Oh, look
how cute. They have menus.

20:51.940 --> 20:55.850
So let's see, they have
"lamb burgers with yogurt,

20:55.940 --> 20:57.610
chipotle meatloaf."

20:57.690 --> 21:00.110
- Ooh, yum.
- Anyone want some olive tapenade?

21:00.180 --> 21:01.900
Wine, please. Wine, please.

21:01.930 --> 21:04.840
Here. Oh, Rebecca, when
do you start your new job?

21:04.980 --> 21:08.110
- It's a sensitive subject.
- Yeah, so maybe we should just drop it.

21:12.790 --> 21:15.700
All I am saying, Robert,
is that it's weird.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.880
Okay, I've tried to track Citizens
for a Corrupt-Free America,

21:18.920 --> 21:20.810
and they are not a
registered lobbying group.

21:20.860 --> 21:22.160
They don't exist anywhere.

21:22.810 --> 21:25.220
I'm sure it's just some
wing nut with a computer.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.370
No, they put it up in
exactly the right places.

21:27.410 --> 21:29.160
Cable news picked up the private jet story

21:29.190 --> 21:31.980
- just as we were coming off the bus.
- Okay, well, look, it's not...

21:32.010 --> 21:33.880
- It's ironic.
- It's not true, so...

21:33.940 --> 21:35.289
It doesn't matter if
it's not true, Robert.

21:35.290 --> 21:37.750
There is somebody out there
who has a lot of information

21:37.790 --> 21:40.000
and a lot of experience,
and for whatever reason,

21:40.020 --> 21:41.410
they've decided to come after me.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.770
Okay, look, you're up in the polls,

21:43.900 --> 21:45.890
- so it makes perfect sense.
- Okay, it makes sense,

21:45.910 --> 21:47.740
but I'm still trying
to find out who it is.

21:47.770 --> 21:49.700
And I've called a couple
of my friends, you know,

21:49.740 --> 21:51.840
on the other side, and
they flatly deny it.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.500
Hey, look, I don't want
you to worry about this.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.850
Robert, they brought up the wig...

21:56.980 --> 21:58.500
And how much it cost.

21:59.270 --> 22:00.240
I mean, they brought up the cancer.

22:00.270 --> 22:02.790
I didn't think they were gonna
do that, and they... they did.

22:18.450 --> 22:21.180
Oh. Too much cilantro in that.

22:21.220 --> 22:22.380
I'm sure it's fine.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.630
How's everyone doing in here?

22:23.680 --> 22:25.290
Oh, great. She's a little jittery.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.310
Kevin, drop it. He didn't
sleep well last night.

22:27.370 --> 22:29.070
- It's our fault.
- Oh, come on, Scotty, for God sake.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.620
Why is it our fault?
Why, because were talking

22:30.670 --> 22:32.920
about getting tested?
Why are you even worried?

22:32.960 --> 22:34.260
It's not like you've
been around the block.

22:34.310 --> 22:36.260
- You've barely set foot outside your own house.
- Would you please stop

22:36.310 --> 22:38.410
being so patronizing
and cavalier about this?

22:39.340 --> 22:41.090
Okay, I'm sorry I ever mentioned it.

22:41.150 --> 22:41.910
- Are you?
- Yeah.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.140
Do you have any idea what
you're asking of me? Do you?

22:46.350 --> 22:47.840
This world the two of you live in,

22:47.870 --> 22:50.350
where everything is so easy
and so much is possible...

22:51.290 --> 22:54.230
You have a surrogate carrying your child.

22:54.310 --> 22:56.190
- You're... you're married.
- Technically, we're not married.

22:56.230 --> 22:57.200
Oh, Kevin, excuse me. I'm so sorry.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.090
You're domestic partners.
Whatever. When I was your age,

23:00.140 --> 23:01.790
I just hoped that I wouldn't get arrested

23:01.850 --> 23:03.300
- when I walked into a gay bar.
- Saul,

23:03.360 --> 23:05.070
if you don't want to
get tested, I'll tot...

23:05.100 --> 23:06.610
- It's too late. I already did.
- What?

23:06.660 --> 23:08.680
I took the test this morning.

23:09.850 --> 23:12.340
- Well, that's a good thing, right?
- It's great for people like you,

23:12.360 --> 23:13.670
because it's spring cleaning for you.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.840
Isn't that what you
said, you go every year?

23:16.210 --> 23:18.420
But you see, I never opened that closet.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.410
Regardless of the world
that you grew up in,

23:21.450 --> 23:23.430
the world that I knew
was a lot less accepting.

23:24.710 --> 23:26.250
People died.

23:28.290 --> 23:29.520
Don't you get it?

23:30.030 --> 23:31.520
For me, bad news is po...

23:33.220 --> 23:34.470
so why don't you plate up this food?

23:34.520 --> 23:35.860
And I will get some fresh air.

23:39.090 --> 23:41.470
It's just pushing my buttons is all.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.180
It's just making me doubt everything.

23:45.320 --> 23:46.250
What are you doubting?

23:47.200 --> 23:49.810
Well, it's been two
months since my last test.

23:50.010 --> 23:51.150
And you were fine.

23:52.020 --> 23:53.680
But I have to have
another one in six months

23:53.720 --> 23:54.850
and another one after that.

23:54.890 --> 23:56.080
It's always gonna be there.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.230
You're not gonna get sick again.

24:00.150 --> 24:00.990
What if I do?

24:04.150 --> 24:05.180
What if I really...

24:06.450 --> 24:07.750
Can't handle this?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.950
Don't do this. Don't.

24:10.020 --> 24:12.800
Don't let one person do this to you.

24:13.170 --> 24:15.300
You are up in the polls,
and you had a bad day.

24:16.010 --> 24:19.010
Okay, I am gonna go get us some wine.

24:28.540 --> 24:29.710
Where the hell is he going?

24:29.770 --> 24:31.800
You know, I don't know.
But he seemed really upset.

24:31.860 --> 24:33.170
You know, I'm gonna go talk to him.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.420
Mom, stop. Don't.

24:34.630 --> 24:36.750
Don't get involved.

24:37.160 --> 24:37.700
Keep drinking.

24:37.750 --> 24:39.540
Yeah, you know, I'll
go to the kitchen, mom.

24:39.590 --> 24:40.920
I will find out what's going on, okay?

24:40.960 --> 24:42.760
I'll come with you for moral support.

24:44.330 --> 24:46.050
Why is your mother calling me?

24:46.280 --> 24:46.920
I don't know.

24:50.070 --> 24:51.590
Hey, Holly.

24:51.630 --> 24:52.500
What's up?

24:55.040 --> 24:56.230
They're drilling again?

24:57.390 --> 24:58.910
Well, who authorized that?

25:01.120 --> 25:01.990
You're kidding me.

25:02.060 --> 25:05.080
- Look, Sarah, I can explain...
- No, I will talk to her. Thank you.

25:05.870 --> 25:07.270
Mom, what the hell are you doing?

25:07.440 --> 25:10.060
Look, it's worth the time
and effort. I know it.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.060
So you paid for more drilling?

25:12.100 --> 25:14.420
- It's my money.
- There's nothing there, mom.

25:14.460 --> 25:16.030
If there was, they
would've found it by now.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.250
Sarah, it's just a few more days drilling.

25:18.290 --> 25:20.090
Oh, God, mom. I love
you, but you have to stop.

25:20.140 --> 25:22.470
You cannot solve everybody's problems...

25:22.560 --> 25:24.360
mine, Kitty's, Saul's.

25:24.410 --> 25:26.420
- Just leave it alone.
- No, I don't believe, as a family,

25:26.460 --> 25:29.660
- we can't help each other.
- Then how can I move on if you don't?

25:35.850 --> 25:37.260
I need more information, Robert.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.070
I'm starting to feel
really weird about this.

25:39.210 --> 25:40.840
There's nothing more I can say.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.670
Why are you taking amiodarone?

25:45.940 --> 25:47.730
I started to have some arrhythmia again.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.330
Does Kitty know?

25:50.370 --> 25:51.750
- I didn't think anyone knew.
- I'm sorry.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.550
I saw the bottle on your desk, all right?

25:53.580 --> 25:55.290
And now you're telling me
you're hiding it from Kitty.

25:55.340 --> 25:56.600
- What is going on, Robert?
- What I'm

25:56.630 --> 25:58.600
asking you to do has
nothing to do with my health.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.740
- Then what is in the safety deposit box?
- Justin, don't do this.

26:00.780 --> 26:02.810
- I need to. You can't expect me to just...
- No, I can expect it.

26:02.830 --> 26:05.050
That's why I chose you.
That's the whole point.

26:06.060 --> 26:08.480
I'm sorry. I'm worried about you, Robert.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.260
Give me the key back.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.900
I mean it. I clearly
chose the wrong person.

26:15.270 --> 26:17.060
Hey, guys. Tasting menu's ready.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.140
Excuse me.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.090
Is he okay? 'Cause he
seems a little testy.

26:26.190 --> 26:28.400
Yeah, you know what?
He... he's fine. He's fine.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.640
Uncle Saul, I... I'm...

26:33.200 --> 26:34.450
Sorry. I didn't realize...

26:34.480 --> 26:36.810
It's okay. Come on. Let's go eat.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.400
Menus.

26:46.570 --> 26:48.220
Thank you. Menus.

26:54.770 --> 26:55.390
Thank you.

26:55.470 --> 26:56.740
Menus.

26:57.250 --> 27:01.070
Okay, so, uh, the idea
behind our restaurant

27:01.150 --> 27:03.910
is comfort food meets organic meets tapas.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.170
And we are very hopeful
and very optimistic.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.040
We better be, 'cause we open in a month.

27:08.340 --> 27:10.220
So, um, you all have your menus.

27:10.300 --> 27:12.040
Um, mark down what you
like in order of preference.

27:12.090 --> 27:14.080
And I want everybody's
opinion, not just Kevin's.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.840
- So, uh, dig in.
- You all right?

27:16.880 --> 27:19.760
What's wrong? Robert?

27:20.070 --> 27:22.060
- I think someone should call 911.
- What's wrong?

27:22.110 --> 27:24.110
- Robert. Robert.
- Justin!

27:24.220 --> 27:25.980
- Call 911.
- What's happening?

27:26.030 --> 27:27.910
You okay? You okay? It's all right.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.940
Look at me. Breathe.
Just breathe, all right?

27:47.320 --> 27:48.730
Oh, hey.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.400
- Oh, wow. What time is it?
- It's early.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.040
How are you feeling?

27:54.490 --> 27:56.560
I've been watching you.
What could be better?

27:56.810 --> 27:59.200
Hmm. I need coffee.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.800
I will call room service.

28:06.140 --> 28:07.100
You know what, honey?

28:09.380 --> 28:10.410
It's not funny.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.410
You have been walking
around with an arrhythmia,

28:13.450 --> 28:14.930
and you never bothered to tell me.

28:16.530 --> 28:17.540
I didn't want you to...

28:17.620 --> 28:19.050
Didn't... didn't want what?

28:19.110 --> 28:21.980
I... to have to choose
between me and the campaign.

28:22.370 --> 28:23.700
That's what grown-ups do.

28:24.520 --> 28:27.370
We talk about it and we set priorities.

28:27.420 --> 28:30.310
- But I want you to win.
- Robert, we had to call an ambulance.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.390
Look...

28:35.240 --> 28:36.610
I got dizzy, all right?

28:37.130 --> 28:38.370
I shouldn't have said anything.

28:38.420 --> 28:40.180
You are... I... I'm sorry.

28:40.270 --> 28:42.450
- Seriously, you are unbelievable.
- I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

28:42.490 --> 28:43.810
You know that? You are unbelievable.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.960
You just will never accept
anything from anyone.

28:49.810 --> 28:52.680
You are incredibly stoic, and I...

28:55.660 --> 28:58.160
I love that about you.

28:59.090 --> 28:59.850
I really do.

28:59.900 --> 29:04.150
But, you know, I also love the
part of you that is vulnerable.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.640
I love the part of you that needs me.

29:07.410 --> 29:10.700
When you can't figure out what
tie to wear, I am in heaven.

29:10.830 --> 29:12.280
When you can't find your glasses, I...

29:12.340 --> 29:13.470
forget about it. I'm...

29:15.000 --> 29:18.120
I just didn't fall in love with the hero.

29:19.090 --> 29:22.420
I fell in love with the guy who was
afraid that, after his heart attack...

29:23.700 --> 29:26.500
he wasn't gonna be able
to keep up with his kid.

29:34.020 --> 29:34.680
Look...

29:36.310 --> 29:38.800
I may have gotten myself into a situation.

29:41.190 --> 29:42.580
Those hits that you've been taking?

29:43.500 --> 29:44.710
They're directed at me.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.540
They're shots across the
bow from a guy named Stanton.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.790
He's in line for a big defense contract.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.320
Go on.

30:01.570 --> 30:02.460
You're out early.

30:02.510 --> 30:05.100
Yeah. I went for a little walk.

30:06.770 --> 30:08.380
- I just talked to Kitty.
- Oh?

30:08.420 --> 30:10.150
She said Robert's gonna be all right.

30:10.210 --> 30:12.770
They are releasing him
from the hospital today.

30:12.850 --> 30:15.080
Oh, boy. That's great. Thank God, huh?

30:16.240 --> 30:18.080
- You're the one I'm worried about.
- Me?

30:18.310 --> 30:20.900
Yeah. Oh, I see. You've
been talking to the boys.

30:22.160 --> 30:25.170
I'm so sorry I didn't know
what you were going through.

30:25.590 --> 30:28.000
Please tell me about this friend of yours.

30:29.980 --> 30:30.790
What can I say?

30:30.840 --> 30:32.210
He wasn't the only one.

30:34.260 --> 30:35.210
I... I... I...

30:37.150 --> 30:39.600
I spent most of my life
living in shame, Nora.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.380
There were no role models
for me when I was growing up.

30:42.850 --> 30:44.250
But you can't be alone every night,

30:44.300 --> 30:46.280
and there... there were
times when I let myself...

30:46.360 --> 30:47.730
but it was always in secret,

30:48.490 --> 30:50.320
and it was rarely with the same person,

30:50.380 --> 30:52.850
so it could never be anything real.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.940
I made sure of that.

30:55.410 --> 30:58.660
Didn't you worry about
what that might cost you?

30:58.710 --> 31:00.490
Don't forget. We knew nothing
about what was going on

31:00.520 --> 31:01.750
in those days, and there were

31:01.790 --> 31:04.860
- times...
- I meant cost you... your... your heart, your soul.

31:05.620 --> 31:09.100
No. No, I c... I couldn't
let myself think that way.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.400
Well, then it's time to start.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.330
Your life is not over yet.

31:12.450 --> 31:14.510
W... when do you get your results?

31:15.190 --> 31:16.910
Now. Today. Whenever I want.

31:16.990 --> 31:19.220
Good. Let's call, and I'll
sit right here with you.

31:19.270 --> 31:21.130
No, I have to do that
when I'm alone. Please.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.960
For crying out loud, what
is wrong with everyone?

31:24.010 --> 31:26.680
What, is there a moratorium
on compassion around here?

31:26.820 --> 31:30.190
We're family. That means you
don't have to do things alone.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.210
That's the whole point.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.410
You are so pushy.

31:32.470 --> 31:33.880
Well, tough.

31:35.540 --> 31:36.740
Here. Take that.

31:36.870 --> 31:37.590
All right.

31:37.940 --> 31:38.930
I have to get the number.

31:39.910 --> 31:41.840
All right. Here it is.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.060
I had a test the other day.
I'm calling for the results.

31:52.090 --> 31:53.310
Saul Holden.

31:53.820 --> 31:55.060
H-o-l-d-e-n.

31:55.560 --> 31:58.420
My birthday is August 11, 1938.

32:02.270 --> 32:03.050
Thank you.

32:03.860 --> 32:04.820
Yeah, thank you.

32:06.920 --> 32:07.750
I'm fine.

32:08.950 --> 32:09.820
I'm fine.

32:10.660 --> 32:13.080
Mom, Holly called. We gotta go.

32:13.130 --> 32:14.720
- Where?
- Narrow Lake. Hurry!

32:15.140 --> 32:17.770
Come on. Narrow Lake.

32:21.780 --> 32:23.510
Can you believe this?

32:23.570 --> 32:25.540
- What is it?
- It's an aquifer.

32:25.590 --> 32:27.520
It's our aquifer.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.250
It's Narrow Lake! I knew it! I knew it!

32:30.300 --> 32:31.470
What does this mean exactly?

32:31.500 --> 32:34.440
It means that we are
in the water business.

32:34.480 --> 32:38.280
I mean, do you know how
much California needs water?

32:38.350 --> 32:41.480
- We are going to be rich?
- How deep is it?

32:41.530 --> 32:43.880
They said it's the deepest
one they've ever seen.

32:43.930 --> 32:45.820
Well, tell 'em to stop
it. Boys, turn it off.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.620
They're getting a well cap. Don't worry.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.410
Oh, dear. We don't want it to run out.

32:49.560 --> 32:53.480
Nora, it's enormous. It's
an entire ocean under there.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.690
What are you doing?

32:55.820 --> 32:56.730
What are you doing?

32:56.760 --> 32:58.540
Oh, no!

33:00.510 --> 33:02.740
Okay, come on, Nora. Let's go.

33:25.130 --> 33:26.370
Yeah sure, right.

33:26.580 --> 33:28.340
I guess I wasn't feeling so hot.

33:28.810 --> 33:30.060
You still want me to give you the key back?

33:30.110 --> 33:32.360
Actually, I do, but not
because I don't trust you.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.060
I think Kitty and I should
handle this ourselves.

33:35.110 --> 33:36.639
Oh, you told Kitty. That's good.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.960
Yeah, I told her everything.

33:37.990 --> 33:39.960
I probably should've a long
time ago, but I think I...

33:40.540 --> 33:42.750
Have to keep learning
this lesson over and over.

33:42.890 --> 33:46.280
Hey. So I heard you were part of a
very covert operation this weekend.

33:46.340 --> 33:48.970
Uh, yeah. So covert, I had
no idea what was going on.

33:49.090 --> 33:51.180
All right. Well, I guess I'll see you guys

33:51.210 --> 33:53.390
- back at the bat cave.
- All right, Justin. Take care.

33:56.060 --> 33:57.520
- Bye.
- See you later, boo-boo. Take care.

33:57.580 --> 33:58.930
- Bye, darling.
- I love you.

34:01.250 --> 34:04.300
Sarah, I know how much you
like the chipotle meat loaf.

34:04.740 --> 34:05.750
Thank you.

34:06.090 --> 34:07.940
You know, your restaurant's
gonna be a big hit.

34:08.110 --> 34:09.020
- Thank you.
- And if not,

34:09.080 --> 34:10.830
Sarah can support you
for the rest of your life

34:10.870 --> 34:13.020
now that she and mom are
the water queens of Ojai.

34:13.050 --> 34:16.060
I think there's enough
queens in the family.

34:16.239 --> 34:17.550
- Oh, Nora.
- Yes.

34:17.690 --> 34:20.560
- Here. This is the Mac and cheese.
- Oh, Scotty. Thank you.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.449
- Come on.
- Okay.

34:21.489 --> 34:23.080
- Bye. Bye.
- Mom...

34:23.139 --> 34:26.290
- Yeah.
- Even if we hadn't found water, I wouldn't trade

34:26.320 --> 34:29.940
- that miserable bus trip for all the pizza in the world.
- You know what?

34:29.989 --> 34:31.199
She's going out again next

34:31.239 --> 34:33.300
- weekend to the bay area.
- Don't push your luck.

34:33.330 --> 34:34.489
- It's wine country.
- Get in the car.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.909
- All right, I'm getting in the car. I'm getting in the car.
- Bye!

34:36.980 --> 34:37.770
Okay, let's go. Hit the road.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.310
- Bye, guys. Bye...
- Oh, you angel. Bye.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.190
Oh, thank you. Bye, you guys.

34:43.230 --> 34:44.469
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Good-bye!

34:44.510 --> 34:45.650
Drive safe.

34:49.679 --> 34:51.120
Are you sure you turned the ovens off?

34:51.179 --> 34:53.070
Uh, yeah. Four times.

34:54.719 --> 34:55.520
How's Robert?

34:56.290 --> 34:58.040
Uh, he's fine. He's fine.

34:58.100 --> 34:59.590
They just, uh, changed his medication.

35:00.120 --> 35:00.770
Good.

35:05.850 --> 35:06.790
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:09.570 --> 35:11.640
Did you mean what you said
about going without you?

35:11.690 --> 35:13.250
To Haiti? Yes, I did.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.430
Look, I was just thinking
about Robert and Kitty

35:17.470 --> 35:20.260
and... and... and how they're
there for each other, you know?

35:20.300 --> 35:22.360
And that... that's what
I want for us, Rebecca.

35:22.860 --> 35:23.740
I know you do.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.330
Me, too.

35:27.370 --> 35:29.430
And you think we can
survive this separation?

35:29.880 --> 35:31.520
Would you be happy any other way?

35:31.890 --> 35:33.190
I know that a year is a long time,

35:33.240 --> 35:34.640
but compared to a lifetime,

35:34.830 --> 35:37.280
- a year is nothing.
- To, I mean, a lifetime?

35:37.500 --> 35:38.960
- Justin...
- Like a real lifetime?

35:39.590 --> 35:40.630
I love you.

35:40.730 --> 35:42.220
I love you, too.

35:48.180 --> 35:50.930
You're listening to
conservative talk radio.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.350
When he was elected president
of the United States...

35:53.410 --> 35:55.720
I've been thinking about
the whole Stanton thing.

35:55.770 --> 35:58.160
Yeah. I think you
should release the tapes.

35:58.220 --> 36:00.960
Reputation was already characterized...

36:01.010 --> 36:01.920
I'm serious.

36:02.690 --> 36:05.210
- We would take a major hit.
- Mm-hmm.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.350
- And we might even lose, but...
- Yeah,

36:07.480 --> 36:09.080
but if we play it safe and wait until

36:09.120 --> 36:11.480
- the election is over, he's still gonna come after me...
- Exactly.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.250
And he's gonna come after me just as hard.

36:16.010 --> 36:18.410
You want to know what
Stanton's big mistake was?

36:20.440 --> 36:21.980
He never should've brought up the wig.

36:24.330 --> 36:26.239
It really pissed me off.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.510
Died in the Civil War.

36:27.511 --> 36:29.630
And the focus on States' rights...

36:30.190 --> 36:30.910
Release 'em.

36:30.970 --> 36:31.690
Let's release 'em.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.610
Through the first quarter
of 2010, but has...

36:39.240 --> 36:40.680
Well, I'm glad you're okay, Saul...

36:41.250 --> 36:42.150
You big drama queen.

36:42.190 --> 36:43.430
That's very funny, Kevin. Th...

36:43.460 --> 36:45.300
Listen, Holly's getting a phone call.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.200
- We'll talk later. Okay?
- Okay. Bye.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.040
- Hello?
- Hey, where are you guys?

36:49.080 --> 36:50.760
We're almost at the Ventura border.

36:50.810 --> 36:52.000
Oh, cool. We're right behind you.

36:52.030 --> 36:54.010
Nora and I have been talking, and we think

36:54.050 --> 36:58.120
- that maybe you should revisit the Hawaiian wedding idea.
- Oh, my gosh.

36:58.150 --> 36:59.940
That wedding I planned was so beautiful.

37:00.390 --> 37:03.580
Or I don't know, maybe David
and I will get married there.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.100
No, no, no, hold on, hold on.

37:05.540 --> 37:07.930
Our mothers want to throw
us that wedding in Hawaii

37:07.960 --> 37:09.570
now that they can afford
it. What do you think?

37:09.620 --> 37:12.860
Um, tell 'em thank you, but,
uh, no. Not Hawaii again.

37:12.900 --> 37:13.960
I'll tell them we'll think about it.

37:13.990 --> 37:16.270
Mom, we're gonna think about it. Hello?

37:17.830 --> 37:18.640
I lost her.

37:19.510 --> 37:21.820
Look, I just say, we
leave well enough alone.

37:21.860 --> 37:23.620
You know, every time we think
about having a big wedding,

37:23.660 --> 37:25.250
- something bad happens.
- I know,

37:25.310 --> 37:26.740
plus it's redundant.
We're already married.

37:26.770 --> 37:28.310
We should just let mom and dad do it.

37:28.311 --> 37:29.780
I mean, I'd go that way.

37:32.510 --> 37:33.940
Are you tired? You want me d drive?

37:34.020 --> 37:36.110
No. No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

37:36.870 --> 37:38.250
Why don't you find something on the radio?

37:46.560 --> 37:47.590
Oh, my God.

38:01.090 --> 38:02.150
Are you okay?

38:02.870 --> 38:03.880
Oh, God.

38:14.670 --> 38:16.120
- Scotty!
- Oh, my God. Kevin!

38:16.350 --> 38:17.360
Scotty, Scotty, are you okay?

38:18.290 --> 38:19.460
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Justin!

38:19.980 --> 38:22.000
I'm fine. I'm fine. Kevin,
are you okay? Are you hurt?

38:22.080 --> 38:23.830
- Help the others. Help the others.
- Mom... what?

38:44.670 --> 38:46.770
- Are you okay?
- I think we hit Robert's car.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.440
Oh, my God. There was a... there was a truck...

38:48.490 --> 38:50.160
- Where's my mom?
- This guy cut him off.

38:50.210 --> 38:52.090
Holly's in the car. I can't
get Holly out of the car.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.910
- Holly's hurt.
- Mom! Mom!

39:00.480 --> 39:02.570
- Just sit down over here.
- Call emergency.

39:02.610 --> 39:04.720
- Just sit down, all right? Just sit... 
- Mom! You okay? Where's Saul?

39:04.770 --> 39:05.840
I don't know. Where's Saul?

39:05.890 --> 39:07.100
I don't know!

39:10.470 --> 39:11.380
I see him.

39:15.260 --> 39:16.180
Saul!

39:16.390 --> 39:18.300
I'm fine. Are you okay?

39:18.380 --> 39:19.380
Yeah. Good. I'm...

39:19.420 --> 39:20.290
Don't touch me!

39:22.850 --> 39:23.870
You can't.

39:30.950 --> 39:32.570
Kitty! It's all right, Robert.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.060
- Kitty! Kitty!
- Oh, no, no.

39:34.110 --> 39:36.070
Justin, Justin. I think he's really hurt.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.950
Okay, okay. I think he's really hurt.

39:37.980 --> 39:40.230
- All right. Let me in. Let me in. Okay.
- I think he's really...

39:40.290 --> 39:42.320
Hey, Robert. Hey, the... there's my man.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.470
Justin, help! Mom's bad.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.060
Justin...

39:47.760 --> 39:49.030
I'll wait for the ambulance.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.000
Go. All right, Kitty. Keep talking to him.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.880
Oh! I'll be back. I'll
be back, Robert. Okay?

39:55.710 --> 39:57.000
Oh, God.

39:58.170 --> 40:01.220
Holly. Rebecca, clear out. Clear. Rebecca.

40:01.300 --> 40:02.560
Holly? Holly, can you hear me?
I don't know if she's breathing.

40:02.570 --> 40:05.400
Can you hear me, Holly? Holly.

40:06.280 --> 40:08.920
Holly? Oh, good, good. Okay,
Holly, it's Justin, all right?

40:09.250 --> 40:12.460
I'm just gonna put this
on to keep you warm, okay?

40:12.660 --> 40:14.300
You're gonna be okay. She's gonna be okay.

40:15.530 --> 40:17.800
Okay, Robert, everything's
gonna be okay, honey.

40:17.960 --> 40:19.620
You're gonna be fine, okay? Talk to me.

40:19.980 --> 40:22.630
- Just talk to me, darling. It's okay.
- You were right.

40:23.450 --> 40:24.280
I was right?

40:25.920 --> 40:28.810
When we brought Evan home from
the hospital, I was scared...

40:30.370 --> 40:33.170
That I wouldn't be able to keep up.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.870
But then I saw you holding him...

40:40.230 --> 40:41.640
So strong...

40:43.070 --> 40:44.330
and so loving.

40:47.170 --> 40:48.460
And I knew that...

40:49.540 --> 40:50.560
you would.

40:55.040 --> 40:56.160
I knew it.

40:58.510 --> 40:59.500
Robert.

41:01.370 --> 41:04.180
Robert. Robert. Talk... talk to me.

41:04.890 --> 41:06.480
Oh, God. Robert...

41:06.850 --> 41:09.220
stay with me, Robert. Right here. Robert.

41:11.020 --> 41:11.600
Oh, my...

41:12.520 --> 41:13.240
Robert?

41:13.460 --> 41:15.090
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Somebody...

41:15.770 --> 41:16.860
Some... oh, Robert.

41:17.880 --> 41:20.190
Robert, please. Please. Please, Robert.

41:20.430 --> 41:23.520
Stay with me. Robert, stay with...

41:25.460 --> 41:27.080
Oh, God, somebody...

41:27.850 --> 41:28.740
Somebody...

41:29.020 --> 41:30.630
somebody help me. Help me.

41:31.620 --> 41:33.490
Robert. Robert.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.430
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

41:37.580 --> 41:38.580
Just stay with me.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.260
Stay with me, Robert.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.380
Oh, Robert... it's gonna be all right.

42:03.590 --> 42:04.560
Kitty!

42:06.290 --> 42:07.260
Kitty!

42:09.390 --> 42:10.390
Kitty!
