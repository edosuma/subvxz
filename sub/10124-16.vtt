WEBVTT

00:10.500 --> 00:12.133
O.K., ERIC.

00:12.133 --> 00:15.467
DEFINE THE POWERS OF
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.

00:15.467 --> 00:17.100
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
IS RESPONSIBLE

00:17.100 --> 00:20.000
FOR KISSING THE AREA
BELOW THE NOSE.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.867
ERIC, WE HAVE
A TEST TOMORROW.

00:23.867 --> 00:27.400
YOU'RE RIGHT,
AND I'M TIRED OF YOU
HOLDING ME BACK.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.600
LET'S GET SOME WORK DONE.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.467
YOU KNOW, WHEN
YOU CONCENTRATE,

00:31.467 --> 00:34.367
YOU GET THIS CUTE
LITTLE FURROWED BROW.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.600
HEY, HEY, HEY.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.967
THERE'LL BE TIME FOR THAT
AND MORE ON THE WEEKEND.

00:38.967 --> 00:41.033
HOW ABOUT RIGHT HERE?
SATURDAY.

00:41.033 --> 00:44.000
I WISH I COULD,
BUT MY COUSIN'S
IN TOWN.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I HAVE TO
HANG WITH HER.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.200
I UNDERSTAND.
DITCH HER.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.033
SHE'S 13 YEARS OLD.

00:50.033 --> 00:52.000
DITCH HER AT THE ZOO.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.400
I CAN'T GET
OUT OF IT.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.200
HOW ABOUT
IF WE DOUBLE?

00:56.200 --> 00:59.033
MY 13-YEAR-OLD BROTHER
IS AVAILABLE.

00:59.033 --> 01:00.500
HMM. WHAT'S HE LIKE?

01:00.500 --> 01:02.667
CORY'S 13.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

01:02.667 --> 01:06.934
LAURIE'S FROM MANHATTAN,
AND SHE'S VERY MATURE
FOR HER AGE.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.934
PERFECT. YOU WON'T BELIEVE
HOW MATURE CORY IS.

01:09.934 --> 01:12.500
GUYS, LOOK AT ME!
I'M A FOUNTAIN.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.567
I GOT TO SHOW SHAWN!

01:19.567 --> 01:21.500
SHAWN!

01:23.100 --> 01:27.934
FORGET CORY.
WHAT ABOUT THE SQUEEGEE GUY
BY THE BUS STATION?

01:27.934 --> 01:30.567
WE'LL JUST GET TOGETHER
IN TWO WEEKS.

01:30.567 --> 01:33.400
CORY WILL BE FINE.
HE WON'T DO THE FOUNTAIN.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.200
HE WON'T BLOW MILK BUBBLES
OUT OF HIS NOSE

01:36.200 --> 01:37.600
OR DO ARMPIT THEATER.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.900
NOT INTERRUPTING.
JUST GETTING A DRINK.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.033
AS YOU WERE.

01:43.033 --> 01:44.400
WHO WAS THAT?

01:44.400 --> 01:45.800
THAT'S CORY'S FRIEND SHAWN.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.033
SO HE'D BE 13, TOO?

01:48.033 --> 01:50.000
I DIDN'T WANT A DRINK.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.467
I HEARD ERIC WAS HERE
WITH AN UNBELIEVABLY
GORGEOUS GIRL,

01:52.467 --> 01:56.133
AND I GOT TO SAY,
IT WAS WORTH THE TRIP.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.400
THANK YOU.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.066
ONCE AGAIN,
AS YOU WERE.

02:01.467 --> 02:04.300
HOW ABOUT HIM
FOR MY COUSIN?

02:04.300 --> 02:08.100
SHAWN? NO. I DON'T WANT
TO DUMP MY LITTLE BROTHER.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.400
I THINK MY COUSIN
WOULD ENJOY BEING
WITH SHAWN.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.934
AND IF MY COUSIN
HAS A GOOD TIME,

02:12.934 --> 02:15.600
WE COULD HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.567
NO. CORY'S MY BROTHER.
CORY'S MY BLOOD.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.500
SHAWN HAS BLOOD.

02:32.867 --> 02:35.000
AH, MR. TURNER,
A REMINDER.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.100
OUR FACULTY
ADVISOR MEETING
IS TODAY AT 4:00.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.567
TODAY? REALLY?
4:00? REALLY?

02:39.567 --> 02:41.000
IS THAT WHERE
WE GET SADDLED

02:41.000 --> 02:44.500
WITH ALL THOSE TERRIBLE
AFTER-SCHOOL,
LIFE-SAPPING CLUBS?

02:44.500 --> 02:46.600
OH, PLEASE LET IT
BE THAT MEETING!

02:46.600 --> 02:49.100
YES, THAT'S THE ONE.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.300
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.600
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE

02:53.600 --> 02:55.800
ABOUT WHAT MEETINGS
YOU GO TO...

02:55.800 --> 02:57.667
MR. PICKY.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.133
I'LL SEE YOU
AT 4:00.

03:00.133 --> 03:01.500
SHAWN. BUD.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.367
I DIDN'T DO IT,
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS.

03:04.367 --> 03:05.834
HOW ABOUT
A DOUBLE DATE

03:05.834 --> 03:09.600
WITH ME, KIM,
AND KIM'S COUSIN?

03:09.600 --> 03:11.467
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK CORY?

03:11.467 --> 03:14.100
YOU DON'T THINK
I'D ASK HIM FIRST?

03:14.100 --> 03:15.467
IS THAT WHAT YOU
THINK OF ME?

03:15.467 --> 03:17.100
NO. I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING OF YOU.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.000
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.033
SO, WHAT'S SHE
LOOK LIKE?

03:22.033 --> 03:24.000
GORGEOUS. SPECTACULAR.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.767
LIKE ELLE McPHERSON
WITH CINDY CRAWFORD'S MIND.

03:26.767 --> 03:29.367
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER
YET, HAVE YOU?

03:29.367 --> 03:30.667
I'M PAYING.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.400
SHE'S JUST MY TYPE!

03:32.400 --> 03:33.800
SO, WHERE WE GOING?

03:33.800 --> 03:34.834
I'M PAYING!

03:34.834 --> 03:35.900
I LOVE IT THERE.

03:37.934 --> 03:41.300
NEXT WE NEED SOMEONE
FOR THE SENIOR SKI TRIP.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.867
JONATHAN, YOU LOOK
AS THOUGH YOU COULD
HANDLE YOURSELF

03:43.867 --> 03:46.467
THROUGH A STRENUOUS
WEEKEND OF PHYSICAL
EXERTION.

03:46.467 --> 03:48.000
AM I RIGHT?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.500
ONLY IF YOU
COME WITH ME.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.967
OHH, ALL RIGHT.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.100
CHESS CLUB ADVISOR.
THAT WOULD, OF COURSE,
BE GEORGE.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.367
WHY?

03:58.367 --> 03:59.734
WHAT?

03:59.734 --> 04:03.000
WHY OF COURSE?
WHY DID YOU SAY OF COURSE?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.400
I...I JUST ASSUMED
THAT YOU WOULD WANT--

04:05.400 --> 04:07.900
THAT THE LITTLE MAN
IN THE SWEATER VEST

04:07.900 --> 04:10.767
BETTER NOT STRAY FAR
FROM THE DRY CLEANERS?

04:10.767 --> 04:13.934
WHY ARE YOU
GETTING SO STEAMED?
IT'S JUST CLUBS.

04:13.934 --> 04:16.200
BY THE WAY,
NICE SWEATER VEST.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.800
YOU JUST
AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME

04:18.800 --> 04:21.000
THAT BECAUSE I DRESS
AND SPEAK THIS WAY,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
THAT I WAS BORN
TO LEAD THE CHESS CLUB?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.467
OF COURSE.
YEAH.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.133
YOU'RE PRINCIPAL.
YOU WANT ANOTHER CLUB,
SAY THE WORD.

04:29.133 --> 04:30.900
I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER CLUB.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.967
I JUST WANT EVERYBODY
TO STOP ASSUMING.

04:33.967 --> 04:37.967
I MOVE THAT WE ALL
STOP ASSUMING ANYTHING.

04:37.967 --> 04:41.000
OF COURSE, YOU PROBABLY
ASSUMED I WAS GOING
TO DO THAT.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.867
WOW.

04:47.367 --> 04:49.033
SORRY. I WOULD'VE
BEEN HOME SOONER,

04:49.033 --> 04:52.400
BUT THEY TOOK
LONGER WITH ME
AT THE HAIRDRESSER.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.667
NO BIG DEAL. THE KIDS HAD
BEER NUTS FOR DINNER,

04:55.667 --> 04:57.600
AND THEY'RE PLAYING
VIDEO GAMES IN THE BATHTUB.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.800
FATHER OF THE YEAR.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.000
I'M OFF
TO MY POKER GAME.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
HAVE FUN, AND THANKS
FOR THE COMPLIMENT
ON MY HAIR.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.133
OH. YEAH. YOUR HAIR.

05:07.133 --> 05:10.000
IT'S REALLY NICE
THE WAY THEY GOT IT--

05:10.000 --> 05:12.600
THE WAY THEY ALWAYS
GET IT, LIKE BEFORE.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.033
HONEY, IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

05:15.033 --> 05:17.200
I GOT A WEAVE THIS TIME.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.800
REALLY? 'CAUSE IT LOOKS
LIKE THE WAY THEY
ALWAYS GET IT.

05:21.800 --> 05:26.300
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T,
BECAUSE I PAID
A FORTUNE FOR THIS.

05:27.967 --> 05:30.400
YOU HAVE MY UNDIVIDED
ATTENTION.

05:30.400 --> 05:34.834
ACTUALLY, IT DIDN'T COST
AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.567
I'M THINKING...A DOLLAR?

05:37.567 --> 05:39.600
EXACTLY. I PAID A DOLLAR.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.700
NOW GO PLAY POKER.
BEER, DIRTY JOKES.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.200
I'LL BET THEY'RE
TELLING SOME RIGHT NOW.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.300
HOW MUCH?
I DON'T REMEMBER.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.900
LET ME HELP YOU.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.800
YOU PROBABLY WROTE IT DOWN
IN YOUR CHECKBOOK.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.600
100...

05:52.600 --> 05:53.967
AND 30.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.400
$130? FOR A HAIRCUT?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.367
DOES THAT INCLUDE AIRFARE?

06:01.767 --> 06:04.400
HONEY, THAT IS
WHAT RODIQUE CHARGES.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.200
TELL HIM TO STOP.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.467
AND GET SOME
OF YOUR MONEY BACK.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.500
I CAN'T DO THAT.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.200
YEAH. 'CAUSE HIS NAME'S
RODIQUE.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.767
NEXT TIME, GO TO
SOMEONE NAMED FRED.

06:14.767 --> 06:17.567
CHARGE YOU 20 BUCKS,
AND YOU CAN READ <i>PLAYBOYS. </i>

06:17.567 --> 06:19.233
PLAY POKER NOW.

06:19.233 --> 06:20.600
$130?

06:20.600 --> 06:22.100
YES. I LOVE YOU, TOO.

06:24.767 --> 06:25.900
HEY, CHUB.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.300
HOW YOU DOING, CURLY?

06:27.300 --> 06:30.133
WHAT DO YOU GOT
FOR A SINGLE GUY
OUT ON THE TOWN?

06:30.133 --> 06:32.700
ENVY, MY FRIEND.

06:32.700 --> 06:36.100
NOT TONIGHT, CHUB.
I'M FLYING SOLO,
JUST LIKE YOU.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.500
WHY AREN'T YOU HANGING
WITH YOUR PAL POTSIE?

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
I CAN'T FIND HIM
ANYWHERE.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.100
LET'S SEE WHO
CHUBBIE CAN FIND.

06:43.367 --> 06:44.400
41!

06:44.400 --> 06:45.900
41. THAT'S ME.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.100
POTSIE!

06:48.100 --> 06:50.133
CHUBBIE, THAT'S AMAZING.

06:50.133 --> 06:52.600
NAH. YOU WANT
TO SEE AMAZING?

06:52.600 --> 06:54.767
62!

06:58.667 --> 07:01.000
HEY, CHUBBIE,
YOU GOT ANY PIE
WITH THAT BURGER?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.600
YOU DON'T NEED IT, KING.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.700
O.K. THANKS.
DON'T TELL ANYBODY
I WAS HERE.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.300
ZIP.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.467
SO, CORY,
HOW YOU DOING?

07:11.467 --> 07:13.567
I TRIED CALLING.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.133
I'VE BEEN HERE.

07:15.133 --> 07:16.734
ACTUALLY,
I'M IN MID-DATE.

07:16.734 --> 07:18.300
OH, YEAH?
ANYBODY I KNOW?

07:18.300 --> 07:20.467
NO. SHE'S IMPORTED
FROM NEW YORK.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.033
THE WINDY CITY.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.834
SO, CAN I CHECK HER OUT?

07:23.834 --> 07:25.000
SURE. COME ON OVER.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.100
SHAWN, DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

07:34.100 --> 07:36.834
BUT YOUR DATE LOOKS A LOT
LIKE MY BROTHER.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.967
HEY, COR.

07:40.967 --> 07:43.300
SHE'S GOT
THE VOICE DOWN, TOO.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.667
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:44.667 --> 07:45.900
ERIC AND I
ARE DOUBLING.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.734
THE GIRLS ARE
IN THE BATHROOM.

07:47.734 --> 07:48.800
YOU'RE DOUBLING?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.500
ON THE DATE
YOU COULDN'T MAKE?

07:50.500 --> 07:53.667
THE DATE I COULDN'T MAKE?

07:53.667 --> 07:56.000
SHAWN, YOU FORGOT THE DRINKS.
HERE YOU GO.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.133
OH. YEAH.

07:59.367 --> 08:02.033
SEE, HE FORGOT
THE DRINKS.

08:02.033 --> 08:06.300
SO, COR, ONLY SEVEN MONTHS
TILL YOUR BIRTHDAY, HUH?

08:06.300 --> 08:09.200
TELL ME ABOUT THE DATE
I COULDN'T MAKE.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.934
IT'S NOT A DATE
LIKE "A DATE,"

08:11.934 --> 08:13.300
IT'S JUST ME AND SHAWN

08:13.300 --> 08:16.600
AND KIM AND KIM'S COUSIN
FROM NEW YORK HAVING DINNER.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.934
ENOUGH ABOUT ME.
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

08:18.934 --> 08:22.500
I WANT THE TRUTH.
WHY WASN'T I INVITED?

08:22.500 --> 08:24.934
NOT NOW.
THE GIRLS ARE COMING.

08:24.934 --> 08:27.467
AHEM. UH, KIM,
YOU REMEMBER CORY.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.033
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR BROTHER?

08:29.033 --> 08:31.300
THE LITTLE BOY
WHO SPITS WATER.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.400
WHY DOES HE
SPIT WATER?

08:33.400 --> 08:34.967
FOR ATTENTION,
I GUESS.

08:34.967 --> 08:37.467
OH, IS IT FUNNY?
COULD I SEE IT?

08:37.467 --> 08:40.400
I'M NOT FEELING
REAL FUNNY RIGHT NOW.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.767
I GOT TO HEAD OUT.
GO BACK TO YOUR DATE.

08:43.767 --> 08:44.800
COME ON, COR--

08:44.800 --> 08:46.200
ERIC,
I'M FINE, O.K.?

08:46.200 --> 08:48.700
LET'S NOT PUSH
HOW FINE I AM.

08:48.700 --> 08:51.300
CORY, YOU UPSET
WITH ME? CORY.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.734
CORY, COME ON, CORY.

08:52.734 --> 08:53.967
ERIC, IT'S FINE.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.467
AND THANKS FOR
REMEMBERING MY NAME.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.133
HEY, CORY.
YOU'RE STILL AWAKE.

09:06.133 --> 09:09.400
MOM AND DAD ALWAYS
LET ME STAY UP
LATER THAN MORGAN.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.300
HA HA. THAT'S GOOD.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.100
PRETTY FUNNY
RUNNING INTO YOU
AT CHUBBIE'S, HUH?

09:14.100 --> 09:16.567
FUNNY LIKE A CLOWN, FUNNY?

09:16.567 --> 09:19.500
LOOK, COR, IT'S A REALLY
COMPLICATED SITUATION.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.867
HOW COMPLICATED IS IT
THAT I'M YOUR BROTHER?

09:21.867 --> 09:23.900
HOW TOUGH IS IT
TO THINK OF ME?

09:23.900 --> 09:26.400
KIM DIDN'T
EXACTLY WANT YOU.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.734
SHE DIDN'T?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.667
BUT I THOUGHT
OF YOU FIRST.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.834
HOW HARD DID YOU PUSH?

09:30.834 --> 09:33.700
I WAS SELLING HARD,
AND YOU WERE
LOOKING GOOD,

09:33.700 --> 09:36.233
RIGHT UP TO WHEN YOU
ACTUALLY SHOWED UP.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.800
THE FOUNTAIN HURT ME?

09:39.800 --> 09:41.600
LOOK, COR,
SHE WAS JUST LOOKING

09:41.600 --> 09:44.567
FOR A DIFFERENT
TYPE OF PERSON.

09:44.567 --> 09:45.934
WHAT TYPE?

09:45.934 --> 09:47.300
SHE WANTED
HER COUSIN'S DATE

09:47.300 --> 09:49.967
TO BE KIND OF COOL
AND DANGEROUS.

09:49.967 --> 09:52.400
AND SHE DIDN'T SEE ME
AS COOL AND DANGEROUS?

09:52.400 --> 09:55.500
YOU HAVE A LESS OBVIOUS
KIND OF DANGER THING...

09:55.500 --> 09:58.033
ON A DANGER SCALE,

09:58.033 --> 09:59.967
WHERE WOULD YOU
PUT ME?

09:59.967 --> 10:01.500
IF PUSHED,

10:01.500 --> 10:04.500
I'D SAY YOU'RE JUST
SLIGHTLY LESS DANGEROUS

10:04.500 --> 10:05.934
THAN LIME JELL-O.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.000
IS THIS WHAT
EVERYBODY THINKS OF ME?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.233
OH, NO. NO.

10:12.233 --> 10:14.400
SOME PEOPLE
THINK LEMON.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.800
SOME PEOPLE ARE WRONG.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.200
BECAUSE I'M DANGEROUS.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.567
I'M OUT OF CONTROL.
I'M...

10:19.567 --> 10:20.467
I'M...

10:20.467 --> 10:23.734
CORY, MR. BUZZY
HAD A BAD DREAM.

10:23.734 --> 10:26.700
CAN HE SLEEP WITH YOU
WHERE IT'S SAFE?

10:26.700 --> 10:28.734
I'M JELL-O.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.600
AND SO HARRY TRUMAN,

10:32.600 --> 10:37.700
THE HUMBLE LITTLE
SWEATER VEST-WEARING MAN
FROM MISSOURI,

10:37.700 --> 10:40.600
SHOCKED EVERYONE
BY BRINGING WORLD WAR II

10:40.600 --> 10:42.867
TO A SWIFT
AND DECISIVE END.

10:42.867 --> 10:45.200
AND THEN,
BY WINNING RE-ELECTION

10:45.200 --> 10:47.200
EVEN WHEN THE PRESS
HAD COUNTED HIM OUT.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.367
HA HA.

10:49.667 --> 10:51.400
[BELL RINGS]

10:51.400 --> 10:55.300
CORY, DURING CLASS
I DID SOMETHING
I DON'T NORMALLY DO--

10:55.300 --> 10:57.000
A LOT OF THINKING.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.567
NOT ABOUT THAT BIG
WAR PART II THING,

10:59.567 --> 11:02.767
BUT ABOUT YOU AND ME
AND THE DOUBLE DATE.

11:02.767 --> 11:04.900
THIS IS WHAT
I CAME UP WITH.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.567
OH, MAN, I HAD IT
A SECOND AGO.

11:09.567 --> 11:13.100
YOU'RE SORRY
FOR NOT TELLING ME?

11:13.100 --> 11:14.200
THAT'S IT.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.100
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.767
YOU PROBABLY FIGURED
ERIC ASKED ME FIRST.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.100
THAT'S IT, TOO.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.000
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.033
NO.

11:23.033 --> 11:24.200
YOU'RE MAD AT ERIC?

11:24.200 --> 11:25.834
I'M NOT MAD
AT ANYBODY.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.567
EVERYONE DID
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO.

11:28.567 --> 11:31.567
YOU GUYS WENT OUT
WITH COOL GIRLS
FROM NEW YORK,

11:31.567 --> 11:35.867
AND I STAYED HOME
AND PLAYED CANDYLAND
WITH MY SISTER...

11:35.867 --> 11:36.934
AND LOST.

11:36.934 --> 11:39.100
THAT'S WHO I AM,
SHAWN--

11:39.100 --> 11:40.400
I'M A CANDYLAND
LOSER.

11:40.400 --> 11:44.000
YOU'RE NOT. I DON'T WANT YOU
THINKING THAT WAY.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.400
WHAT'D YOU DO
AFTER CANDYLAND?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.000
ME AND MORGAN COLORED.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.400
I CAN'T SEE YOU
LIKE THIS.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.867
I STAYED IN THE LINES.

11:51.867 --> 11:55.300
MOM EVEN PUT MINE
ON THE FRIDGE.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.300
TALK TO HIM, MAN.

11:58.867 --> 12:01.734
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW,
YOU JUST HAVE TO--

12:01.734 --> 12:03.300
SHAWN?

12:04.400 --> 12:06.200
I'M ALL ALONE.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.734
MR. MATTHEWS...
HOW ARE YOU, MY BOY?

12:09.734 --> 12:13.100
I DON'T--I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.400
NOW, NOW. BUCK UP.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.900
EVERYONE
GETS PASSED OVER

12:18.900 --> 12:21.000
FOR A DATE
NOW AND THEN.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.900
MR. FEENY,
EVERYONE HERE THINKS
I'M SAFE AND BORING.

12:24.900 --> 12:30.500
WELL, DIFFICULT AS IT IS
FOR ME TO RELATE
TO YOUR SITUATION,

12:30.500 --> 12:33.734
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
CONSTRAINED BY HOW
PEOPLE THINK OF YOU.

12:33.734 --> 12:38.500
GEORGE, THE SKI CLUB
AND I WOULD LOVE YOU
TO RECONSIDER

12:38.500 --> 12:40.233
COMING ALONG
ON THE BIG WEEKEND.

12:40.233 --> 12:43.800
LOOK.
WE EVEN FOUND YOU
A NICE SKI VEST.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.567
SHSHHH, SHSHHH,
SHSHHH...

12:46.567 --> 12:48.300
WHY, THANK YOU, JONATHAN,

12:48.300 --> 12:50.400
BUT I'M RATHER BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.967
COULD YOU STICK IT
IN YOUR EAR TILL I NEED IT?

12:54.567 --> 12:56.567
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK OF ME

12:56.567 --> 12:58.900
AS STODGY AND CONSERVATIVE.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.400
AREN'T YOU?

13:00.400 --> 13:03.000
THERE YOU ARE.
MY POINT EXACTLY.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.200
YOU SEE
MY OUTER APPEARANCE,

13:05.200 --> 13:09.000
AND YOU CONCLUDE
THAT I'M CAUTIOUS
AND UNADVENTUROUS.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.500
LIKE LIME JELL-O.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.767
ALL RIGHT.

13:13.767 --> 13:17.400
IF YOU LET PEOPLE'S
PERCEPTION OF YOU

13:17.400 --> 13:18.867
DICTATE
YOUR BEHAVIOR,

13:18.867 --> 13:20.767
YOU'LL NEVER GROW
AS A PERSON.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.200
BUT IF YOU LEAVE
YOURSELF OPEN
TO EXPERIENCE,

13:24.200 --> 13:26.567
DESPITE
WHAT OTHERS THINK,

13:26.567 --> 13:28.467
THEN YOU'LL LEARN
AND GROW.

13:28.467 --> 13:30.300
AND WHEN YOU GROW
AND MATURE,

13:30.300 --> 13:33.100
THEN YOU CAN RUB

13:33.100 --> 13:37.834
THEIR SMUG LITTLE
EARRING-WEARING
NOSES IN IT.

13:37.834 --> 13:41.100
YOU KNOW,
WE GOT TO SHOW PEOPLE

13:41.100 --> 13:42.934
WE'RE NOT
WHAT THEY THINK.

13:42.934 --> 13:44.400
YEAH.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.867
EVERYONE THINKS
WE'RE SAFE AND CAUTIOUS.

13:46.867 --> 13:47.900
YEAH.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.700
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING...

13:49.700 --> 13:51.200
STUPID!

13:54.133 --> 13:55.967
UH, YEAH.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.600
HEY, BABY.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.567
THERE YOU ARE.
I MISSED YOU
THIS MORNING.

14:02.567 --> 14:04.367
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
SLEEP IN.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.200
WELL, YOU
GOT IN SO LATE.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.033
SO HOW WAS
THE POKER GAME?

14:09.033 --> 14:10.233
SAME OLD, SAME OLD.

14:10.233 --> 14:12.767
OH, WAIT.
WHOA, FREEZE.

14:12.767 --> 14:15.500
OH, YES, I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

14:15.500 --> 14:17.367
WITH THE WEAVE
AND EVERYTHING.

14:17.367 --> 14:20.600
I SEE WHERE THAT'D
TAKE A LOT OF WORK.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.567
WELL, THANK YOU,
HONEY.

14:22.567 --> 14:24.834
SO HOW DID YOU
COME OUT?

14:24.834 --> 14:26.767
DID YOU WIN OR,
YOU KNOW, LOSE?

14:26.767 --> 14:28.000
LITTLE UP, LITTLE DOWN.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.600
WELL,
GORDY JUST CALLED
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.400
HA HA. GORDY.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.800
HE WAS CURIOUS
IF WE WERE STILL
ON SPEAKING TERMS

14:35.800 --> 14:38.900
AFTER YOUR $300--
YOU KNOW--LOSS.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.467
IF I WANT TO SPEND
A NIGHT WITH THE BOYS

14:45.467 --> 14:47.767
AND DROP A BUCK OR TWO
OR 300,

14:47.767 --> 14:50.800
IT REALLY SHOULDN'T
AFFECT WHETHER WE'RE
ON SPEAKING TERMS.

14:53.233 --> 14:54.567
ARE WE?

14:56.300 --> 14:58.100
PUDDIN'?

14:58.100 --> 15:01.467
YOU HAVE MY UNDIVIDED
ATTENTION.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.200
THEY CALLED ME NAMES.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.000
WALLY CALLED ME A WUSS,

15:05.000 --> 15:06.500
BERT SAID I WAS WHIPPED,

15:06.500 --> 15:08.734
GORDY GOES,
"BAWK BAWK BAWK."

15:08.734 --> 15:11.200
I HATE IT
WHEN HE DOES THAT.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.667
ALAN, HOW COULD
YOU LOSE $300?

15:13.667 --> 15:16.567
MY BEST CARD
ALL NIGHT WAS
THE SIX OF CLUBS.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.133
ASK FOR
YOUR MONEY BACK.

15:18.133 --> 15:19.667
"YOU CAN'T
DO THAT."
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

15:19.667 --> 15:22.900
"OH,
BUT I CAN."
OH, BUT I
CAN DO THAT.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.767
WHAT DID YOU GET
FOR $300?

15:24.767 --> 15:26.800
A SHIRT THAT
SMELLS LIKE SMOKE.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.500
AND WHAT DID I GET
FOR MY $130?

15:29.500 --> 15:31.600
THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL HAIR
I EVER SAW...

15:31.600 --> 15:34.200
THAT LOOKS
JUST LIKE IT DID
BEFORE.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.200
KISS ME
AND WATCH THE HAIR.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.100
COR, I'M HITTING
THE BATTING CAGES.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.467
YOU UP FOR IT?

15:46.467 --> 15:50.600
THE KID THAT LAUGHS AT YOU
DOESN'T WORK THERE ANYMORE.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.834
CORY?

15:51.834 --> 15:52.834
DUDE?

15:58.233 --> 15:59.200
<i>DEAR ERIC, </i>

15:59.200 --> 16:00.934
<i>YOU THINK I'M SAFE? </i>

16:00.934 --> 16:02.000
<i>WELL, I'M NOT. </i>

16:02.000 --> 16:04.133
<i>TO SHOW YOU </i>
<i>AND EVERYBODY ELSE, </i>

16:04.133 --> 16:06.100
<i>I'M GOING TO LOOK DEATH </i>
<i>IN THE EYE. </i>

16:06.100 --> 16:08.600
<i>I'M GOING TO LAUGH </i>
<i>IN THE FACE OF DANGER. </i>

16:08.600 --> 16:12.667
<i>I'M GOING </i>
<i>TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK </i>
<i>WITH MR. FEENY. </i>

16:12.667 --> 16:13.400
MR. FEENY?

16:13.400 --> 16:15.133
<i>YEAH, WITH MR. FEENY. </i>

16:15.133 --> 16:17.367
<i>DON'T TRY AND STOP ME. </i>

16:21.000 --> 16:22.233
IN A FEW MOMENTS,

16:22.233 --> 16:23.467
ADVENTURE PARK
IN PHILADELPHIA

16:23.467 --> 16:27.100
OPENS WHAT THEY CLAIM TO BE
THE MOST TERRIFYING

16:27.100 --> 16:30.200
AMUSEMENT PARK ATTRACTION
EVER CREATED--

16:30.200 --> 16:31.400
"THE LAST RIDE."

16:31.400 --> 16:34.367
THE PARK VOWS TO OPEN
THE RIDE AS SCHEDULED

16:34.367 --> 16:36.400
DESPITE PROTESTS
FROM PARENTS' GROUPS,

16:36.400 --> 16:39.000
CLERGYMEN,
AND NASA ENGINEERS.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.700
ALTHOUGH ADVENTURE PARK OWNER
LEONARD SWINDEL

16:41.700 --> 16:44.000
CLAIMS THE RIDE
IS ENTIRELY SAFE,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.033
HE IS, NEVERTHELESS,
REQUIRING THAT ALL RIDERS

16:47.033 --> 16:49.400
SIGN A CATASTROPHE WAIVER

16:49.400 --> 16:54.567
INDEMNIFYING THE PARK
AGAINST WHAT MR. SWINDEL
CALLS "AN ACT OF GOD."

16:54.567 --> 16:57.734
MR. SWINDEL,
IF THE RIDE'S SO SAFE,

16:57.734 --> 16:59.600
WHY THE WAIVER?

16:59.600 --> 17:01.100
THINGS HAPPEN.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.300
WHO WOULD BE
FOOLHARDY ENOUGH

17:04.300 --> 17:06.767
TO STEP INSIDE
THIS BULLET CAR

17:06.767 --> 17:09.200
FOR A 90 MILE AN HOUR BLAST

17:09.200 --> 17:12.100
STRAIGHT INTO THE HEART
OF TERROR?

17:12.100 --> 17:13.967
HELLO.
HELLO.

17:13.967 --> 17:17.300
GENTLEMEN,
ALL I CAN ASK
IS WHY?

17:17.300 --> 17:21.233
BECAUSE ME AND GEORGE
ARE THE MOST FEARLESS
GUYS YOU'LL EVER MEET,

17:21.233 --> 17:24.000
AND WE LAUGH
IN THE FACE OF DANGER.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
HA!

17:26.000 --> 17:29.300
OBVIOUSLY,
YOUR GRANDFATHER
FEELS THE SAME WAY.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.500
YOUNG LADY, I'M NOT
HIS GRANDFATHER.

17:31.500 --> 17:36.000
I'M THE THRILL-SEEKING
PRINCIPAL OF
JOHN ADAMS HIGH,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.467
AND I'D LIKE TO SAY HELLO
TO THE FACULTY MEMBERS

17:39.467 --> 17:42.500
WHO I NOTICE
ARE NOT IN LINE HERE

17:42.500 --> 17:44.367
IN THE HEART OF DANGER.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.934
RIGHT NOW, OUR BRAVE
ADVENTURERS

17:45.934 --> 17:49.600
ARE CLIMBING INTO
THE CAR AS THEY
SIGN THE WAIVERS

17:49.600 --> 17:53.000
WHICH INCLUDE
AN ORGAN DONATION
REQUEST.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.834
YEAH, YEAH.
HELP YOURSELF.

17:57.233 --> 17:58.400
WHY ARE YOU
HERE?

17:58.400 --> 18:00.066
THIS NOTE.
FROM CORY?

18:00.066 --> 18:01.734
FROM FEENY.

18:01.734 --> 18:05.700
CORY, GET OUT OF THERE.
YOU'LL KILL YOURSELF.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.133
MR. FEENY...

18:07.133 --> 18:08.233
ENJOY THE RIDE.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.100
GEORGE, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

18:11.100 --> 18:15.600
SURPRISED TO SEE ME
SO FAR FROM THE CHESS
CLUB, MR. TURNER?

18:15.600 --> 18:19.200
THIS ISN'T THE WAY
TO PROVE YOU'RE
DANGEROUS.

18:19.200 --> 18:23.800
WOULD YOU CARE TO
JOIN ME, MR. TURNER?

18:23.800 --> 18:25.133
HA HA. NO.

18:25.133 --> 18:26.300
HA HA.

18:26.300 --> 18:27.300
AS YOUR OLDER BROTHER,

18:27.300 --> 18:29.467
I'M TELLING YOU
TO GET OUT NOW.

18:29.467 --> 18:31.100
NOW YOU'RE
SO CONCERNED?

18:31.100 --> 18:33.567
NOW YOU STAND UP
FOR ME?

18:33.567 --> 18:34.600
TOO LATE!

18:34.600 --> 18:36.000
I'M DEAD.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.133
YOU'RE CRAZY.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.934
DANGEROUSLY CRAZY.

18:38.934 --> 18:41.100
LET'S LIGHT
THIS CANDLE!

18:41.100 --> 18:42.834
O.K., LOOK,
I UNDERSTAND.

18:42.834 --> 18:44.367
YOU PROVED
YOU'RE DANGEROUS.

18:44.367 --> 18:46.400
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.033
NEXT DOUBLE DATE,
YOU'RE GOING.

18:48.033 --> 18:49.800
I'M GOING?
YOU'RE GOING.

18:49.800 --> 18:50.967
I'M GOING!

18:50.967 --> 18:54.200
WARP FACTOR 10,
MR. SULU!

18:54.200 --> 18:55.300
AND THEY'RE OFF...

18:55.300 --> 18:57.400
STRAIGHT UP,
STRAIGHT UP,

18:57.400 --> 18:59.400
AND STRAIGHT DOWN.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.567
THERE THEY GO,

19:00.567 --> 19:03.100
THROUGH
THE VERTICAL FLUME...

19:03.100 --> 19:04.800
DIZZY!
DIZZY!

19:04.800 --> 19:08.567
THROUGH THE SPINNING
WALL OF FIRE...

19:08.567 --> 19:09.967
HOT!
HOT!

19:09.967 --> 19:13.800
NOW THE SCREAMING
DIVE OF DEATH.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.000
DYING!
DYING!

19:15.000 --> 19:16.200
AND HERE THEY COME,

19:16.200 --> 19:18.600
BACK FROM THEIR
HARROWING JOURNEY.

19:24.367 --> 19:26.500
CORY, ARE YOU
O.K., MAN?

19:26.500 --> 19:27.567
AAH!

19:27.567 --> 19:28.567
CORY!

19:28.567 --> 19:29.567
AAH!

19:29.567 --> 19:30.800
CORY, IT'S OVER!

19:33.600 --> 19:34.800
PIECE OF CAKE.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.100
WHAT?

19:36.100 --> 19:39.900
I THREW UP
A PIECE OF CAKE.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.500
GEORGE...GEORGE...

19:41.500 --> 19:44.033
WEREN'T YOU IN BACK
WHEN YOU LEFT?

19:44.033 --> 19:45.133
TALK TO ME.

19:45.133 --> 19:48.967
AT ONE POINT
I WAS THROWN FORWARD...

19:48.967 --> 19:50.834
OUT OF THE CAR.

19:50.834 --> 19:53.100
I HAD TO RUN
IN FRONT OF THE CAR.

19:53.100 --> 19:57.300
GEORGE, I'LL
NEVER LOOK AT YOU
THE SAME WAY AGAIN.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.834
THAT TOOK GUTS.

19:58.834 --> 20:02.500
IF YOU WANT
THE SKI CLUB,
YOU GOT IT.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.600
DON'T WANT SKI CLUB.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.300
YOU WANT
THE CHESS CLUB?

20:06.300 --> 20:07.867
DON'T WANT CHESS CLUB.

20:07.867 --> 20:09.467
WHAT
DO YOU WANT?

20:09.467 --> 20:12.600
WANT YOU TO HELP
GET THE KID OFF MY BACK.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.467
COME ON.
LOOSEN THE GRIP.
LOOSEN THE GRIP.

20:15.467 --> 20:16.800
THERE YOU GO.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.033
JEEZ, COR, NEXT TIME
THAT GIRL WANTS TO DATE

20:20.033 --> 20:22.033
THE MOST DANGEROUS
GUY I KNOW,

20:22.033 --> 20:23.100
IT'S YOU.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.400
REALLY?

20:24.400 --> 20:27.600
YEAH. I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU DID THIS
BECAUSE OF ME.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.600
YEAH, I DID, DIDN'T I?

20:30.600 --> 20:34.133
MR. FEENY,
YOU PROBABLY DID THIS
BECAUSE OF MR. TURNER.

20:34.133 --> 20:37.400
YES, I SUPPOSE
THAT'S SO.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.834
ERIC, DO ME A FAVOR?

20:39.834 --> 20:41.300
ANYTHING,
O DANGEROUS ONE.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.467
I LEFT MY SHOE IN THERE.
WOULD YOU GET IT?

20:43.467 --> 20:47.300
IN THE BACK? WHERE?
I DON'T SEE IT.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.734
JONATHAN,
HELP HIM FIND IT,
FOR PETE'S SAKE.

20:49.734 --> 20:52.834
IT'S NOT BACK HERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WOULD--

20:54.567 --> 20:56.967
O.K., LIGHT THAT CANDLE!

20:56.967 --> 20:58.200
AAH!
AAH!

21:05.200 --> 21:07.767
WHO'S IN? WALLY? BERT?

21:07.767 --> 21:10.200
AND RODIQUE,

21:10.200 --> 21:13.500
OUR VERY SPECIAL FRIEND
FROM THE HAIR BOUTIQUE.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.233
WHICH COLOR OF CHIPS
ARE THE DOLLARS,

21:16.233 --> 21:18.500
MAGENTA
OR THE BLUEBERRY?

21:18.500 --> 21:19.867
THE BLUEBERRY.

21:19.867 --> 21:21.567
MY LUCKY COLOR.

21:21.567 --> 21:23.767
HOW MANY
MUST I PUT IN?

21:23.767 --> 21:25.400
JUST ONE.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.100
HERE SHE COMES.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.667
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
THE BAD NEWS.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.200
THREE 10s.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.700
WOW. THAT IS VERY
IMPRESSIVE, ALAN,

21:34.700 --> 21:38.200
AND ON MANY DAYS,
THAT WOULD BE
A WINNING HAND.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.567
HOWEVER,
TODAY IS SPECIAL.

21:39.567 --> 21:42.734
TODAY RODIQUE HAS--
HOW DO YOU SAY--

21:42.734 --> 21:44.000
A FULL BOAT.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.200
READ THEM AND CRY.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.200
THAT'S IT.
I'M BUSTED.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.400
I'M OUT.
TURN OFF THE LIGHTS.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.400
NIGHTY-NIGHT.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.000
BAWK BAWK BAWK...

21:55.000 --> 21:56.500
WHAT WAS THAT?

21:56.500 --> 21:57.767
I AM NOT SURE.

21:57.767 --> 21:59.400
IT CAME FROM WALLY.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
THIS GAME'S
TOTALLY OUT OF HAND.

22:01.400 --> 22:05.967
SORRY I'M LATE,
BOYS, BUT I GOT
THE PIE.

22:05.967 --> 22:08.567
KING, LEND ME
A FEW BUCKS, WILL YA?

22:08.567 --> 22:12.233
HOW ABOUT
150 MILLION?
WILL THAT DO?

22:12.233 --> 22:14.100
THAT MIGHT
BUY A HAIRCUT.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.400
MAYBE.
