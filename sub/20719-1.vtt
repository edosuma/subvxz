00:09.042 --> 00:14.279
Man: We need to talk about what
happened with Ethan.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.416
I'm so sorry.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.685
It was a mistake.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.055
I'm sorry. We're not comfortable
having you here anymore.

00:23.057 --> 00:27.226
Man: Just pack your things.
You're leaving tomorrow.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.128
Goodbye.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.516 --> 00:51.550
They're making me leave.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.292
You didn't tell him,
did you?

01:00.294 --> 01:04.328
No! I didn't say anything.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.665
Okay.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.434
It's fine.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.636
This house sucks anyway.

01:10.638 --> 01:14.473
We'll find a better
one next time.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.544
But...

01:18.546 --> 01:21.280
I don't really
want to go.

01:22.449 --> 01:24.650
Fine.

01:25.552 --> 01:26.752
You stay here.

01:26.754 --> 01:30.689
You'd just weigh me
down anyway.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.917
Allan, honey.
No balls in the house.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.654
This is your great granddaddy's
stuff. We got to be careful.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.255
It's our house now, right?

04:17.257 --> 04:20.459
Yes. Grandma did
leave it to us.

04:20.461 --> 04:23.528
But you still
got to be careful.

04:23.997 --> 04:30.535
One day love, this house
and everything in it is
gonna go to you and Caleb.

04:30.537 --> 04:34.906
And you're going to want to pass
it off to your kids and your
kids after that, right?

04:34.908 --> 04:37.042
-Mm-hm.
-So you have to
take care of it.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.646
-Okay.
-All right. Good boy.

04:41.648 --> 04:44.016
Careful with the ball.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.451
Whoa.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.553
Wow.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.656
Looking good,
honey bunny.

04:50.658 --> 04:51.356
I know.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.991
Gosh. I love
this place.

04:52.993 --> 04:57.429
I still can't believe my
grandma left it to me, out of
all the cousins.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.831
I think she realized how much
home and family meant to you.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.769
-I think she's was
a very wise woman.
-Yes, well--

05:03.771 --> 05:08.040
I just wish that I could stay
at home all day with the kids

05:08.042 --> 05:09.408
instead of starting
work so soon.

05:09.410 --> 05:14.379
Once this business gets off
the ground, you'll be able
to do just that.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.683
Speaking of which, I got to go.
The prototype came in.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.784
Ah. Okay.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.052
-Love you.
-Okay.

05:20.054 --> 05:23.388
Love you, too.
I'm going to need that.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.723
Yes.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.626
Thank you very much.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.896
-All right, Allan.
I'll see you tonight, okay?
-Bye, daddy!

05:30.898 --> 05:32.964
-Bye, buddy. I love you.
-Love you, too.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.800
Have a good day at work,
love.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.601
Thank you.
See you guys tonight.

05:36.603 --> 05:39.871
-Love you. Bye.
-Love you.

05:43.943 --> 05:48.380
Allan, honey. Why don't you go
check out that tree house?

05:48.382 --> 05:50.382
Okay.

05:57.423 --> 06:02.427
-Allan, honey. Stay away
from the ledge, okay?
-Okay.

06:02.862 --> 06:07.733
All right. "Recommendation
for nanny wanted."

06:07.735 --> 06:14.906
Part-time nanny needed
for two wonderful children.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.677
Oh, smoking. No.
It's disgusting.

06:18.679 --> 06:23.982
Fay: Free room and board.

06:23.984 --> 06:27.486
Plus a small stipend included."

06:27.488 --> 06:33.592
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jen. Jennifer Russell.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.460
Okay.

06:39.599 --> 06:40.532
Fay: Oh, that was quick.

06:40.534 --> 06:44.035
"Hi. I saw your post..."

06:48.741 --> 06:51.743
They're moving out of town.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.445
That sounds perfect.

06:53.447 --> 06:58.817
Doesn't that sound perfect?
Yes, it does.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.153
Next weekend it is.

07:01.155 --> 07:03.655
Tim: We're going to take a
little time with our decision

07:03.657 --> 07:06.758
but, um, it was great
to see you

07:06.760 --> 07:07.959
and thank you so much
for taking

07:07.961 --> 07:13.565
time out of your
day to come over.
We'll be in touch.

07:16.836 --> 07:17.702
Have a good day.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.538
-Bye.
-What did you think?

07:19.540 --> 07:23.942
I don't like that lady.
She keeps calling me Alex.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.012
Next.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.151
Huh?

07:33.553 --> 07:35.821
I always wanted
one of these.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.822
Hey, that's mine.

07:36.824 --> 07:42.227
Well, I'll give it back to you
if you give me a high five?

07:42.229 --> 07:44.029
There we go.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.865
I'm assuming
you're the Wells's?

07:46.867 --> 07:49.668
-Yeah. Are you--
-Jen Russell.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.002
-So nice to meet you.
-Hi. How are you?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.672
-Nice to meet you too.
-Why don't you
have a seat.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.740
I'm fay. This is my
husband Tim.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.477
This is Allan and that's Caleb
in the stroller.

07:58.479 --> 08:02.180
Looks like you've had
a lot of experience
for how young you are.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.715
Yeah. I love kids.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.951
I grew up with a lot
of brothers and sisters,

08:05.953 --> 08:07.853
so I was always babysitting.

08:07.855 --> 08:08.854
Then when I moved out here,

08:08.856 --> 08:12.691
it just kind of seems
like the natural way
to pay my way through school.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.260
I studied psychology
at the local university.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.995
Oh. Wow. That's great.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.799
-And you were with
the Harpers for--
-three years.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.168
Yeah, I was the nanny
for Ben and mark,

08:23.170 --> 08:24.536
but they're moving now, so...

08:24.538 --> 08:28.540
-Well, they could not speak
more highly of you.
-Aww.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.743
All of your references
really loved you.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.578
Yes. I mean, before
we're gonna hire anybody

08:33.580 --> 08:36.881
we're going to do
a full background check.
That's okay with you, right?

08:36.884 --> 08:38.950
Oh, of course.
You can't be too careful.

08:38.952 --> 08:42.854
-Yeah.
-The thing is though I do need
to know pretty quickly.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.222
The Harpers are
moving soon.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.592
Fay: Well, that actually works
really well for us.

08:47.594 --> 08:51.763
We need someone before
i start work next week.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.666
I don't know
if Ms. Harper mentioned it,

08:54.668 --> 08:55.901
but we only need
someone part-time.

08:55.903 --> 09:03.542
So we're offering a small fee
and we're making up for it
with free room and board.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.910
Oh.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.079
I think I could work
with that.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.683
-Yeah.
-Great. Well--

09:11.884 --> 09:14.219
I guess we'll be in touch.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.820
Okay. Sounds good.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.857
-Jen: Thank you so much.
-Have a great day.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.158
Jen: See ya, Allan.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.227
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.263
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.765
What'd you think?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.667
I like her.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.634
Yeah.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.137
All right. Let's see.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.809
-Hey Jen! Come on in.
-Hey!

09:37.811 --> 09:39.611
Let me grab that for you.

09:39.613 --> 09:42.047
Thanks.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.251
Oh, fay.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.587
This view is amazing.

09:48.589 --> 09:53.692
This house is stunning.
It's everything I ever
dreamed of.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.694
Thanks. Yeah.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.261
We think so too.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.130
You know, it use to be my
grandmother's house.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.098
And my parents lived here.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.803
We've only been here for a few
weeks but it's already starting
to feel like home.

10:04.805 --> 10:08.173
Here, why don't I show
you to your room.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.742
Tim: Hey Jen,
good to see you again.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.243
Hope you like the house.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.244
-Thanks.
-How you doing?

10:13.246 --> 10:15.747
-Good how are you?
-Gonna show her to her room.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.316
Oh, great.
Yeah.

10:19.218 --> 10:23.054
This house is beautiful.
Did you decorate it
yourself?

10:23.056 --> 10:24.122
Sort of.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.924
It's a little bit my mom.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.225
A little bit of me.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.061
But I think it works.

10:30.663 --> 10:31.296
So this is you.

10:31.298 --> 10:35.834
And we still have a few
pieces to add, but...

10:35.836 --> 10:38.336
It's beautiful.

10:38.338 --> 10:42.207
And this bed.
It's all incredible.

10:42.209 --> 10:42.941
Yeah, you know.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.043
Tim wanted to get rid of
some of this stuff.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.847
But, I slapped a new coat
of stain on it.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.316
And I think I saved it.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.384
I love that.

10:52.386 --> 10:55.420
Giving things
second chances.

10:55.422 --> 10:58.289
Allan: Come on, jenjen.
Come and see my room!

10:58.291 --> 11:00.692
Okay!

11:00.694 --> 11:01.393
Where is it?

11:01.395 --> 11:05.263
-It's upstairs.
-Okay. This way?

11:07.667 --> 11:11.236
-It's going to be okay.
-Okay.

11:11.370 --> 11:14.305
Don't worry.

11:19.278 --> 11:20.078
Good morning.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.880
So, I already checked.
Caleb is still sleeping.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.982
But he'll probably wake up
in an hour. So make sure--

11:23.984 --> 11:28.253
give him his bottle,
get Allan ready and
take him to school.

11:28.255 --> 11:33.324
I know. I know I'm a helicopter
mom. But, I just...

11:33.326 --> 11:35.427
Maybe I can push back
starting for a day or two.

11:35.429 --> 11:38.763
Seriously, fay.
You're going to have to
leave him sometime.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.298
It's not gonna get
any easier.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.801
I meant to ask, what is it
that you do exactly?

11:42.803 --> 11:49.474
Oh. Digital archiving.
I work for museums, libraries,
those sort of places.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.376
And we preserve their
materials in digital form.

11:51.378 --> 11:56.448
You know, I'm pretty sure
i can start work tomorrow.

11:56.450 --> 11:58.783
Seriously, fay,
don't worry about anything.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.852
I have all the important numbers
and the kids' schedules.

12:00.854 --> 12:04.956
And if I need anything Allan
will help me. Right al-pal?

12:04.958 --> 12:08.293
-Uh-huh, jenjen.
-Yeah.

12:08.928 --> 12:09.360
Okay.

12:09.362 --> 12:13.131
Just please don't hesitate
to call for anything.

12:13.133 --> 12:17.302
And you, have fun
today, okay?

12:17.304 --> 12:19.104
-Okay.
-Okay.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.206
All right, you hungry?
You want some eggs?

12:21.208 --> 12:26.444
Jen:
No? What about cereal?
Fruit?

12:36.422 --> 12:37.322
-Kayla.
-Yeah?

12:37.324 --> 12:39.424
This is fay Wells.
Fay Wells, Kayla rapp.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.860
Fay is going to be helping us
on the folio project.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.061
Great.
Nice to meet you, fay.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.829
You too, Kayla. I'm really
excited to get started.

12:44.831 --> 12:49.000
So if you ladies don't need me
for anything else, I'm going
to get out of here.

12:49.002 --> 12:53.071
-Hey! I need to talk to you
about the manchurian files.
-Sure, yeah.

12:53.073 --> 12:56.074
- Okay. I'll be right back.
Have a seat.
-Yeah.

12:56.076 --> 12:59.444
-What's up?
-Kayla: Hey listen,
so the documents--

12:59.446 --> 13:04.249
-i was thinking,
they weren't quite right.
-Man: What?

13:15.494 --> 13:16.928
Caught you.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.564
Oh, I'm sorry,
i was just--

13:19.566 --> 13:21.933
first time leaving the kids
at home with the nanny?

13:21.935 --> 13:23.902
-Yeah.
-Don't worry.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.236
It'll get easier.

13:25.939 --> 13:30.375
Kayla: So let me bring you
up to speed on everything.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.317
Allan?

13:42.188 --> 13:44.022
Jen?

13:46.492 --> 13:48.259
Jen?

13:49.461 --> 13:51.129
Allan?!

13:54.433 --> 13:56.201
Jen?!

13:58.838 --> 13:59.270
Mommy!

13:59.272 --> 14:02.307
You scared me.
- Jen: Hey fay!

14:02.309 --> 14:05.243
-Fay: Where were you?
-Oh, at the neighbors'.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.845
What were you doing there?

14:06.847 --> 14:11.482
New friends. They have super
cool video games and everything.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.418
Wow! Cool.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.255
-Woman: Just smile
and hand her the flyer.
-Jen: Oh, hello.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.458
Hi, we're the bensons.
I'm Claire. My son, Kyle.

14:20.460 --> 14:24.429
-We're your neighbors.
-Oh, I'm the new nanny,
Jen Russell.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.897
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

14:25.899 --> 14:26.965
Hey, I'm Kyle.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.000
-Oh, hi guys!
-We just wanted to

14:29.002 --> 14:33.238
give you this reminder
about the safari supper
that we're organizing.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.274
Claire: It's basically an annual
event for the block.

14:36.276 --> 14:39.377
We make a dish. We go from
house to house, to house,

14:39.379 --> 14:42.046
and it's just a great way
for the neighborhood to
get to know each other.

14:42.048 --> 14:46.551
It sounds like a lot of fun.
I don't know if I'm going to be
able to cook something.

14:46.553 --> 14:51.322
-Well, I can do it.
I love to cook. So...
-Fay: Are you sure?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.423
Jen: Yeah, it's no problem.

14:52.425 --> 14:55.660
I'm late though.
It was nice meeting you guys.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.429
Nice to meet you.
Welcome.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.933
-Looks like you got a good one.
-Right?

15:01.935 --> 15:05.503
Fay. Guess who got
a meeting with rod topping

15:05.505 --> 15:07.305
in Portland,
three weeks from today?

15:07.307 --> 15:09.240
That's fantastic!

15:09.242 --> 15:11.609
-Uh, who's rod topping?
-Who's rod topping?

15:11.611 --> 15:15.914
He's only the owner and operator
of the biggest sporting goods
empire in the whole world.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.983
And he's interested
in the helmet your company
is producing?

15:18.985 --> 15:22.620
Well we're not producing yet.
It's prototype. But, hold on.

15:22.622 --> 15:26.057
Oh no,
they all fall down.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.459
See, look. Here she is.
The spartan 3000.

15:28.461 --> 15:34.332
See, inside here those are
actually safety sensors all
along the inside there.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.302
Oh cool!
Does it come in pink?

15:37.304 --> 15:39.070
Uh, no.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.673
Honey, I think you're
going to be late.

15:41.675 --> 15:43.308
Yeah, okay.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.176
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.210
-Bye, buddy.
-Bye, dad.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.313
I'll see you later.
You be good, okay?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.481
-Okay.
-All right.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.184
Um, Jen, I'm going
to be home late tonight.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.053
-Is that okay with you?
-Oh yeah, no problem.

15:55.055 --> 15:58.122
Don't forget, though,
you have the event with
the neighbors tonight.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.659
I have most of what I need.
I just need to grab a few things
from the market.

16:01.661 --> 16:06.164
Right. I can drop you by
the store, it's on my way.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.533
Oh, perfect.
You want to go, Allan?

16:08.535 --> 16:11.636
-Mm-hm.
-Let's go.

16:30.122 --> 16:30.521
Jen.

16:30.523 --> 16:34.592
-I forgot to give you money.
-Oh, thanks.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.696
Alexa?

16:38.698 --> 16:42.300
I'm sorry. You must have
mistaken me for someone else.

16:42.302 --> 16:45.069
I'm sorry. You look like
someone I knew.

16:45.071 --> 16:48.539
It happens all the time.
I have a common face.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.642
You know,
you better go to work.
You might be late.

16:51.644 --> 16:55.079
I finally have everything
i need now. Thanks so much.

16:55.081 --> 16:58.149
All right.
Bye-bye, now.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.084
See you tonight.

17:06.657 --> 17:08.526
okay, what--
what are you doing here?

17:08.528 --> 17:11.729
I swear, Alexa,
i didn't know you lived here.

17:11.731 --> 17:16.034
I promise,
i won't say anything.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.734
You better not.

17:17.737 --> 17:21.372
We all know accidents
can happen.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.781
I don't see it.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.516
Maybe it's over here.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.318
I don't see it here.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.054
How about
around the corner.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.390
- Yeah, I think
it's on this side.

17:39.392 --> 17:44.095
Hi Tim. Did you get my message
about that party tonight?

17:44.097 --> 17:48.433
I really think one of us
should be home for it.

17:48.801 --> 17:52.170
Hey! I haven't seen you
in a while.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.572
-Great party.
-Thanks.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.212
Excuse me.
Oh, fay.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.780
You saw what I did
with the furniture.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.149
I wanted it to be a surprise.
I hope you like it.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.285
I really think it improves
the flow of the room.

18:07.287 --> 18:13.291
No, you know,
i kind of liked it
the way it was before.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.560
How are ya?

18:15.562 --> 18:18.129
You're having fun?
Huh?

18:18.131 --> 18:20.098
Fay! There you are.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.333
Love what you've done
with the place.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.302
And this one.
What an angel, huh?

18:24.304 --> 18:27.839
The hors d'oeuvres that
she made, they're amazing!

18:27.841 --> 18:30.608
-Thank you.
-Fay and Tim, how are you?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.777
-Oh...
-Actually, this
is our nanny, Jen.

18:32.779 --> 18:36.114
-This is my wife, fay.
-I'm sorry. Nice to meet you.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.816
The hors d'oeuvres are amazing.
Please give her the recipe.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.586
Oh! Jen actually made those.

18:41.588 --> 18:44.255
-Would you mind
giving it to me?
-Oh, yeah!

18:44.257 --> 18:46.491
-Tim Wells.
Sounds so familiar.
-Yeah.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.193
-You played sports, right?
-Yeah, a little bit.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.529
Until I got injured
and had to retire.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.532
I'm going to go check
on the baby.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.666
-You want a drink?
-Yeah.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.768
-Let's do that.
-Actually, it led me
into my new career.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.539
I'm working with a company
that's developing a smart
football helmet.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.574
-Nice!
-We got a prototype going.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.177
I actually have a meeting
with rod topping in 3 weeks.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.813
Congrats!
Old 'whipped topping' himself?

19:08.815 --> 19:10.748
I'm sorry,
'whipped topping?'

19:10.750 --> 19:12.683
please tell me that's some
kind of kinky nickname.

19:12.685 --> 19:16.354
Nah. Topping caught a pie
in the face from an angry
employee last year.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.456
It was all over the Internet.
He was super pissed.

19:18.458 --> 19:22.627
Okay, well,
maybe don't use that
in your presentation then.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.229
Yeah. You think?
I don't know, maybe I will.

19:25.231 --> 19:29.367
Okay, folks!
Time to move the party
next door. Let's go.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.537
Follow me. House next door.
Come on.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.205
Safari supper!

19:34.207 --> 19:36.474
Excuse me.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.476
-Hey!
-Yeah.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.579
Time to go next door for soup
or salad, or something.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.414
Um, I'm going to stay here.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.949
Someone-- someone
should stay with the baby.

19:44.951 --> 19:49.187
And I kinda just want to
clean up a little bit
before going to bed.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.756
Uh, did you see
the furniture?

19:51.758 --> 19:53.758
-Yeah, it looks great.
-Tim! Vamoose!

19:53.760 --> 19:57.628
Oh yeah, hold on.
Yeah, really opens the room up,
huh?

19:57.630 --> 19:59.530
-Okay. You know best. All right.
-All right.

19:59.532 --> 20:03.701
Listen, I'm going to go
with Jonathan. He might be
interested in investing.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.736
So it could be big. Okay.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.737
All right.

20:06.739 --> 20:10.608
-Goodnight. See you in a bit.
-Goodnight. Love you.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.692
Great.

20:30.495 --> 20:33.264
Mommy, I'm hungry.

20:33.266 --> 20:33.965
Jen?

20:33.967 --> 20:34.999
Are you up?

20:35.001 --> 20:37.735
-Just a minute.
-Okay.

20:42.441 --> 20:43.941
Jen?

20:47.346 --> 20:50.281
Jen?

20:50.283 --> 20:52.617
Are you awake?

20:53.852 --> 20:55.519
Jen.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.990
The kids need breakfast!

20:59.391 --> 21:00.291
Oh, that's right.

21:00.293 --> 21:03.327
Oh. Actually,
i don't feel so good.

21:03.329 --> 21:06.864
Are you gonna be able to get
out of bed at all today?

21:07.633 --> 21:09.367
What?

21:10.736 --> 21:15.306
Oh, that's not mine.
Someone must have left it
here last night.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.008
Um...I'll feel fine.
Just go.

21:17.010 --> 21:19.710
I'll get everything together.
Don't worry about it.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.948
Okay, I have to get to work.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.816
The detail on this
is just beautiful.

21:58.818 --> 21:59.450
Yeah.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.719
So after we're done with this,
what's the next step?

22:01.721 --> 22:05.956
Once this is all scanned,
we'll present it to the board.

22:05.958 --> 22:06.991
And assuming we get approvals,

22:06.993 --> 22:09.760
we'll move on
to the other collections.

22:09.762 --> 22:10.961
Okay.

22:18.036 --> 22:21.072
Eh, what happened to her?

22:21.074 --> 22:23.407
She said she wasn't
feeling well today.

22:23.409 --> 22:27.678
Oh god, a killer hangover
would do that to you.

22:55.807 --> 22:58.442
hi! I'm fay Wells.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.077
Hi, I'm fay Wells.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.812
I'm a digital archivist.

23:01.814 --> 23:06.150
I have two sons. Mm-hm.
Allan and Caleb.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.721
Allan: Jen!

23:11.390 --> 23:12.690
Allan: Jen!

23:12.692 --> 23:16.093
It's lunch.
You want to go?

23:16.428 --> 23:18.629
Allan: Jen!

23:18.631 --> 23:21.565
No. I have to get home.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.111
Jen!

23:34.980 --> 23:37.915
Why are you
in my clothes?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.016
Oh, um...

23:39.018 --> 23:42.987
We were playing dress up.
I must have fallen asleep.

23:43.555 --> 23:45.790
Where are the kids?

23:46.191 --> 23:49.627
-Um...
-Where are they?

23:52.197 --> 23:54.198
Allan?

24:01.540 --> 24:02.039
Allan.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.674
Oh, my god! Caleb!

24:03.676 --> 24:08.612
Allan: I'm sorry mommy!
I was just trying to give him
a bath.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.181
I'm so sorry. I--

24:10.183 --> 24:12.683
I don't know what's wrong
with me. I'll do better.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.785
Do better?
You almost killed Caleb.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.155
Jen, obviously we can't trust
you with the kids anymore.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.757
Tim: You need to go now!

24:19.759 --> 24:20.191
But--

24:20.193 --> 24:23.861
I have nowhere to go.
I'll be homeless.

24:23.863 --> 24:28.232
Please, just let me stay
till at least the morning.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.034
All right, fine.
You can stay the night,

24:30.036 --> 24:32.870
but tomorrow you're gone.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.206
Just--

24:46.151 --> 24:48.886
are you sure?

24:49.855 --> 24:51.856
Okay.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.591
Yeah.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.498
Okay.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.132
Yeah.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.001
Thanks.

25:05.271 --> 25:09.607
There's no babysitters
available on such short notice.

25:10.109 --> 25:13.611
I don't want to leave Jen
home alone anyway.

25:13.613 --> 25:17.281
Maybe I should just work from
home. Just until she leaves.

25:17.283 --> 25:20.184
-Which will hopefully
be any minute.
-Yeah.

25:20.186 --> 25:24.722
Look, I got to get going.
You sure you're okay here
alone all day today?

25:24.724 --> 25:25.656
Yeah.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.791
Okay.
All right.

25:27.793 --> 25:28.225
Call me.

25:28.227 --> 25:31.061
-Love you.
-Love you too.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.897
Hey, be good, all right?

25:32.899 --> 25:35.900
-Okay.
-See you later on.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.636
-Allan, honey, are you okay
here for a moment?
-Mm-hm.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.805
All right. I'm just going
to go check on something.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.243
Jen!

25:49.614 --> 25:52.082
Jen!

25:52.084 --> 25:54.118
Seriously!

25:54.786 --> 25:56.854
Jen!

25:58.990 --> 26:02.192
Open up.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.127
Jen!

26:03.129 --> 26:07.197
I need to know
what time you're leaving.

26:07.199 --> 26:07.932
Jen!

26:07.934 --> 26:11.035
When is your ride
getting here?

26:13.238 --> 26:14.338
Who are you?

26:14.340 --> 26:17.741
What are you doing
in my house?

26:17.743 --> 26:19.209
Yo!

26:20.912 --> 26:26.050
What are you doing?
You can't have strange men
in my house!

26:32.891 --> 26:37.761
Allan, honey.
Are you okay?
Did he touch you?

26:41.666 --> 26:45.102
Yes. Hi. Can I get the police
at 211 maple drive, please?

26:45.104 --> 26:48.005
There's a strange man
that is in my house.

26:48.007 --> 26:51.775
No. He didn't exactly
break in.

26:51.777 --> 26:55.145
No, he didn't threaten me.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.881
When can you just get here?

26:57.883 --> 26:58.382
Thank you.

26:58.384 --> 27:03.754
Hurry. Allan, honey.
Let's go find your
brother, okay?

27:12.665 --> 27:17.301
-They're still there?
-Yeah, they're downstairs
in her room.

27:24.243 --> 27:27.211
Open the door now!

27:28.346 --> 27:30.080
Who the hell are you?

27:30.082 --> 27:31.849
Who the hell are <i> you?</i>

27:36.821 --> 27:39.156
Bye, baby.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.229
Later, baby.

27:45.430 --> 27:49.299
Hey! What the hell do
you think you're doing?
This is our home.

27:49.301 --> 27:52.102
You need to get out now.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.209
Do you hear me?
Are you listening to me?

27:59.211 --> 28:00.010
Uh, not really.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.880
Dammit you--

28:03.448 --> 28:05.983
-You perv!
-No, no, i--

28:07.986 --> 28:11.155
that guy is a creep.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.732
What happened?

28:21.734 --> 28:22.132
Huh?

28:22.134 --> 28:23.400
I don't know.
She's nuts, okay?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.769
We just need to get
out of here. Now.

28:25.771 --> 28:27.237
We need to call the cops.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.833
Fay.

28:55.835 --> 28:56.967
Fay: Go away!

28:56.969 --> 28:59.770
No, fay!
Let me in the house
right now.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.472
You can't just kick
me out like that!

29:01.474 --> 29:04.108
No, just go!
You need to go!

29:04.110 --> 29:06.210
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in!

29:06.212 --> 29:10.981
Fay: Go away! Please, just
leave my family alone!

29:10.983 --> 29:12.816
Jen: This is my family.

29:12.818 --> 29:16.987
I'm going to call the police.
Go away!

29:17.222 --> 29:19.823
Too late.

29:19.958 --> 29:20.824
Someone already did.

29:20.826 --> 29:25.062
It's terrible, okay?
She just kept pounding on the
door and trying to break in.

29:25.064 --> 29:28.532
-Because I live here!
-No! Not anymore!

29:28.534 --> 29:30.033
Yes, I do.
I can prove it!

29:30.035 --> 29:33.437
I have a letter
that was sent to me here.

29:34.372 --> 29:35.839
Your address is on here,
ma'am.

29:35.841 --> 29:39.409
That's because
she <i> used</i> to live here.
But she doesn't anymore.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.545
She was our nanny
and we had to let her go.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.413
They just kicked me out
without any notice.

29:43.415 --> 29:46.517
I told them I'd be homeless.
But they didn't even care.

29:46.519 --> 29:51.021
Everything was fine
until Mr. Wells started
hitting on me.

29:51.023 --> 29:54.124
And then, I guess Mrs. Wells
just got jealous or something

29:54.126 --> 29:55.826
because she just told me
to leave.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.327
That is a lie!
She's lying!

29:57.329 --> 30:00.097
Kyle: Hey, it's true.
I saw it from the window.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.566
Mr. Wells pulled the towel
right off of her.

30:02.568 --> 30:05.302
He's just saying that
because he is in love with her.

30:05.304 --> 30:10.908
Fay. It's true.
I saw it from the window too.

30:11.509 --> 30:13.210
Where's your husband at,
ma'am?

30:13.212 --> 30:17.080
He went to go buy locks.
We have to change our locks.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.982
Officer: I wouldn't let
him do that ma'am.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.019
Look, I understand you want
her out of your house.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.555
But the fact that she's
receiving mail at your address

30:24.557 --> 30:27.090
means that she's
established residency.

30:27.092 --> 30:29.993
According to the civil code
you can't prevent her from

30:29.995 --> 30:32.029
gaining reasonable access
to the property,

30:32.031 --> 30:34.131
nor can you remove her
private property.

30:34.133 --> 30:38.902
This is our house.
We have small kids inside.

30:38.904 --> 30:39.937
What are we supposed to do?

30:39.939 --> 30:43.373
You'll have to evict her
through the courts, ma'am.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.443
Would you like to press
charges against Mr. Wells?

30:46.445 --> 30:47.377
-What?
-Jen: No.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.947
I just want to go to my room.
I haven't been feeling well.

30:49.949 --> 30:54.985
That's probably
because you're still hungover!
She almost killed my son!

30:54.987 --> 30:58.889
Ma'am, you have to
take it up with the courts.

30:59.157 --> 31:02.192
I suggest you let her
back in the house.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.294
Let her get her things.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.964
Do you understand?

31:08.066 --> 31:09.533
You understand?!

31:09.535 --> 31:11.301
Yes.

31:11.603 --> 31:15.439
Look, this makes no sense!
How can they force us
to keep her here?

31:15.441 --> 31:18.108
Tim. Please calm down.

31:18.110 --> 31:21.879
Calm down? Do you hear that?
It's 1:00 am!

31:27.118 --> 31:29.319
What?

31:29.321 --> 31:30.254
What?!

31:30.256 --> 31:33.223
You have to stay
away from her.

31:33.491 --> 31:35.425
You can't go near
her again.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.929
"Again"? What is that
suppose to mean?

31:38.931 --> 31:41.131
Tim, she told the police

31:41.133 --> 31:45.002
that you sexually
harassed her.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.070
And Claire, next door,

31:47.072 --> 31:50.107
saw something about a towel?

31:50.109 --> 31:51.408
No.I--

31:51.410 --> 31:52.442
I tried to get her attention.

31:52.444 --> 31:57.147
I grabbed her arm
and then she dropped
her towel on purpose.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.449
The girl is a nut.

32:07.458 --> 32:11.528
Come on, you don't
believe her, do you, fay?

32:18.036 --> 32:19.703
No.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.605
I mean...

32:22.607 --> 32:28.278
I just don't understand
why you would lay a hand
on her in the first place.

32:28.280 --> 32:32.582
I didn't, okay?
It wasn't like that.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.656
So, what are we
supposed to do now?

32:39.658 --> 32:44.695
They said we're supposed to
file a "three day notice."

32:47.132 --> 32:48.398
Three days?

32:48.400 --> 32:51.501
Would you please
keep it down?

32:51.503 --> 32:54.671
Tim, honey. Don't.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.376
Tim: Finally.

33:06.751 --> 33:07.584
my power went out.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.553
That's it. No more water.
No more heat. No more food.

33:09.555 --> 33:13.991
You might be living there now
but we're gonna do whatever
it takes to get rid of you.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.326
Tim, stop.
She's filming this.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.394
Allan, honey.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.363
Stop being so mean
to jenjen!

33:19.365 --> 33:23.400
That notice
goes on that door tomorrow.

33:36.414 --> 33:39.449
hopefully that's enough
to scare her into leaving.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.085
I'll make some coffee.

33:42.087 --> 33:43.587
Yeah.

33:46.491 --> 33:51.461
I don't
have a problem with that.
That's totally fine.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.030
Hey Johnny!

33:53.032 --> 33:54.698
Hey, you want to check
those specs out?

33:54.700 --> 33:56.466
I'm good, man.
We're good.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.068
I gotta-- I gotta--

33:58.070 --> 33:59.136
we'll catch up.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.105
Okay.

34:02.107 --> 34:05.242
Crazy idea with some helmet.

34:34.605 --> 34:36.540
She saw the notice.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.574
She was not happy about it.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.676
That's good, right?

34:39.678 --> 34:42.712
She's taking it seriously.

34:46.384 --> 34:48.485
Hey, you want more
cereal, buddy?

34:48.487 --> 34:50.253
Okay.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.324
Can I use these?

34:55.327 --> 34:57.160
Sure.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.765
Mommy, is Jen leaving
this time?

35:01.767 --> 35:04.201
Yep. I think so, hon.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.368
I hate you!

35:05.370 --> 35:09.272
-Allan!
-Allan. Get back here!

35:11.576 --> 35:15.479
I guess all it took
was an official-looking
legal notice.

35:15.481 --> 35:18.482
Maybe she'll be gone
by this weekend.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.650
Let's hope so.

35:24.522 --> 35:26.289
Mommy, what's that?

35:26.291 --> 35:29.526
I don't know, honey.
Come on.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.532
Tim?

35:36.434 --> 35:38.568
Fay:
Tim. What's going on?

35:38.570 --> 35:40.170
There's a moving truck
out front.

35:40.172 --> 35:41.805
I don't know.
It just pulled up.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.174
Watch out, Allan.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.412
Can I help you?

35:49.414 --> 35:51.481
Hi, uh...Jen Russell?

35:51.483 --> 35:53.550
Uh, downstairs.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.218
Thanks.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.589
She's finally moving out.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.428
Good.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.933
Excuse me, sir.
No. That stays downstairs.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.735
Um, Ms. Russell said
that it goes.

36:11.737 --> 36:14.204
No. I'm the home owner.
That's ours.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.539
That stays downstairs.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.641
Okay, but we won't have
any room.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.542
-What?
-Room for what?

36:18.544 --> 36:22.879
No, no, no, no. Sorry.
Nothing's going in today.
No. That's not--

36:22.881 --> 36:26.583
it says here bought
and paid for by Jen Russell.

36:26.585 --> 36:27.350
Delivery too.

36:27.352 --> 36:31.555
She's redecorating. Just--

36:33.559 --> 36:35.892
What is going on?

36:37.828 --> 36:38.762
Hi. May I help you?

36:38.764 --> 36:41.498
-Timothy and fay Wells?
-Yeah.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.335
You've been served.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.204
What?

36:48.739 --> 36:50.874
Let's open it.

36:55.813 --> 36:57.747
She's suing <i> us?</i>

36:57.749 --> 37:01.251
For just $20,000...

37:01.253 --> 37:03.587
All this can go away.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.823
$20,000? What--
you're crazy!

37:06.825 --> 37:09.859
Yeah, right.

37:10.828 --> 37:14.698
Tim, honey.
We have to get a lawyer.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.900
Allan, honey.
Come here.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.241
Let's see.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.542
Well, she's definitely
suing you

37:25.544 --> 37:29.713
for interference of quiet
enjoyment of her residence.

37:29.715 --> 37:30.580
Tim: Are you kidding me?

37:30.582 --> 37:34.618
Look, she's the one
making all the noise.
She's not even a resident.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.353
We hired her as a nanny.
We gave her a room.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.788
She's not a nanny anymore,
so she needs to get out.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.625
Yeah, you would think.
But not in this state.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.560
The laws here are very
tenant-friendly.

37:43.562 --> 37:46.863
Look, I wouldn't even
let someone crash on my couch,

37:46.865 --> 37:48.865
let alone move in.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.968
Once someone's in,
good luck getting them out.

37:51.970 --> 37:57.374
Now, I assume she's not
doing anything illegal
on the premises?

37:59.343 --> 37:59.876
Lawyer: No?

37:59.878 --> 38:01.478
Well, that's too bad.
If she were,

38:01.480 --> 38:04.347
we could get
an expedited eviction.

38:04.349 --> 38:08.585
Listen, I just want to be clear
with you up front.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.554
This can get very,
very costly.

38:11.556 --> 38:15.492
Perhaps you should be
thinking about, maybe,

38:15.494 --> 38:17.694
paying her off to leave.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.329
I wouldn't pay her a cent!

38:19.331 --> 38:23.967
Mr. Alden, we can barely
afford to pay you.

38:27.371 --> 38:28.471
All right.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.906
I understand that.

38:29.908 --> 38:30.940
Let's see.

38:30.942 --> 38:35.378
You've already filed for a
'three day notice'. That's good.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.881
The next step is to file
an unlawful detainer.

38:37.883 --> 38:43.520
In about a month or so,
we'll get a hearing.

38:43.522 --> 38:47.691
A month? What are we supposed
to do until then?

38:51.330 --> 38:53.096
She stays in your house.

38:53.098 --> 38:57.067
And you supply her,
provide her with whatever

38:57.069 --> 38:59.602
services you were
committed to originally.

38:59.604 --> 39:02.539
-Like water, power, food.
-Food?

39:02.541 --> 39:04.607
Maybe not food
but everything else,

39:04.609 --> 39:07.844
you need to supply it
without complaint.

39:07.846 --> 39:08.678
And I mean this.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.013
All right. This is serious.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.916
By law, she's considered
your tenant.

39:12.918 --> 39:17.687
And that means,
you are prohibited
from any coercive acts

39:17.689 --> 39:19.456
which entice her
into leaving.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.391
Do you understand?

39:22.026 --> 39:23.426
You must leave her alone.

39:23.428 --> 39:28.431
Unless you want to wind up
with her owning your house.

39:30.601 --> 39:35.004
This is--
this is ridiculous.

39:52.089 --> 39:57.394
maybe we should take
the kids to your mom's.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.629
Just until she's gone.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.664
Tim: Are you kidding me?

40:02.666 --> 40:03.967
I know, but,

40:03.969 --> 40:08.405
I have the presentation
at the library to prepare for,

40:08.407 --> 40:13.009
and you've got your trip
to Portland coming up soon.

40:13.011 --> 40:18.948
I just think
it would be easier.

40:18.950 --> 40:22.152
Safer for all of us.

40:23.754 --> 40:26.589
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.

40:26.957 --> 40:31.694
I'll call my mom tomorrow
and then we'll drive them up
over the weekend.

40:31.696 --> 40:34.164
Let's not say anything
about what's going on, okay?

40:34.166 --> 40:37.867
It'll just scare her.
Make her worry.

40:37.869 --> 40:43.740
- We'll just tell her
the kids miss her so much.
- Okay.

40:51.081 --> 40:53.550
Get in here.

41:00.991 --> 41:03.493
Who's gonna break?
Who's gonna go?

41:03.495 --> 41:06.196
You. Go.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.184
I'll go.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.153
Thank you.

41:32.056 --> 41:34.924
Tim: I owe you one.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.004
Woman: Yeah.

41:49.707 --> 41:53.710
What's good, mama?

41:57.748 --> 42:00.550
Okay?

42:11.595 --> 42:14.631
Caleb.
Shh!

42:16.133 --> 42:18.635
It's okay.

42:18.637 --> 42:23.039
It's okay. Hey.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.641
Hey! Stay away from him!

42:24.643 --> 42:26.743
I was just bringing him
his pillow. He was crying.

42:26.745 --> 42:30.713
Look-- just--
you're not even supposed to
be in here. Get out!

42:30.715 --> 42:33.216
Tim: Now!

42:55.739 --> 42:57.941
thank you.

43:23.701 --> 43:25.802
are you sure you just don't
want to stay with my mom

43:25.804 --> 43:28.871
when we drop the kids off
this weekend?

43:29.073 --> 43:33.710
There's no reason for us
both to be here.

43:33.712 --> 43:34.110
No.

43:34.112 --> 43:38.147
I am not gonna let her
run us out of our own house.

43:38.149 --> 43:41.684
Look.
Full screen.

43:45.656 --> 43:47.390
They're eating our food.

43:47.392 --> 43:49.325
Ugh.

43:50.027 --> 43:53.763
Whatever happens,
don't come down.

43:55.866 --> 43:57.734
You're not supposed to
eat our food.

43:57.736 --> 44:02.071
We're not eating it.

44:05.243 --> 44:07.043
What does that mean?

44:07.045 --> 44:10.113
Did you put something
in our food?

44:29.833 --> 44:31.267
Ugh.

44:31.269 --> 44:34.070
I am so happy...

44:34.072 --> 44:37.840
We are getting the kids
out of here.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.292
Goodnight.

44:57.462 --> 44:59.395
Every time
I'm in the kitchen,

44:59.397 --> 45:01.364
you're in the kitchen--

45:01.366 --> 45:04.934
Jen: I'm not gonna
be making you sandwiches.

45:08.406 --> 45:10.740
Bye, baby.

45:19.383 --> 45:23.286
Kyle: Jen! That was
pretty funny the other
night in the kitchen, wasn't it?

45:23.288 --> 45:26.089
With Mrs. Wells, like,
freaking out at you and all?

45:26.091 --> 45:28.791
-All right, how did you know?
-I saw it on the cameras.

45:28.793 --> 45:31.794
Oh, that stupid Teddy bear cam
they think I don't know about?

45:31.796 --> 45:34.464
No, no, no. I'm talking about
the new ones.

45:34.466 --> 45:35.198
What?

45:35.200 --> 45:39.302
Yeah, they're, like,
all over the house.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.506
You know what?

45:43.508 --> 45:45.441
I'll show you.

45:45.443 --> 45:46.075
Okay.

45:46.077 --> 45:49.011
Kyle:
I sometimes hack into
people's laptops

45:49.013 --> 45:51.781
and nanny cams
just for fun.

45:51.783 --> 45:53.316
See.

45:55.219 --> 45:57.353
Jen: Okay. That is creepy.

45:57.355 --> 46:02.458
They've been watching me
this whole time. Those pervs.

46:03.460 --> 46:06.429
Oh, they are so gonna pay.

46:21.446 --> 46:23.513
Woo!

47:26.510 --> 47:28.411
Tim: Mr. topping.
Gentlemen.

47:28.413 --> 47:30.279
Good to see you.
Thank you for having me today.

47:30.281 --> 47:33.616
As most of you know, I received
a traumatic brain injury

47:33.618 --> 47:35.151
which ended my football
career for good.

47:35.153 --> 47:39.589
Now, I really believe
that if I had a helmet
like the spartan 3000,

47:39.591 --> 47:42.058
it would have
never happened.

47:42.060 --> 47:42.992
So, as you can see,

47:42.994 --> 47:46.963
with the inflatable lining
and flexible shell--

47:46.965 --> 47:49.131
hey Tim, let me stop you
right there.

47:49.133 --> 47:52.368
I took this meeting because
I'm a fan of yours.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.070
-Tim: Thank you.
-You're welcome.

47:54.072 --> 47:55.638
Not so much because of your
football playing

47:55.640 --> 47:57.640
but how turned your life
around after the injury.

47:57.642 --> 48:00.509
Now, we've seen these kinds
of flexible helmets before.

48:00.511 --> 48:02.979
So I want you
to tell me something.
Other than that,

48:02.981 --> 48:07.250
is there anything else that is
proprietary about this helmet?

48:07.252 --> 48:09.118
Uh, yeah.
Actually, sir,

48:09.120 --> 48:10.586
the innovative aspect
of the helmet

48:10.588 --> 48:13.656
is the sensor, which is
built into the lining.

48:13.658 --> 48:15.992
So say a...

48:16.126 --> 48:18.461
Say a player
gets hit in the head.

48:18.463 --> 48:20.363
Coach on the sideline
gets notified

48:20.365 --> 48:23.432
just how hard the
actual impact actually is.

48:23.434 --> 48:26.335
-Okay.
-Like this.

48:30.540 --> 48:32.975
Tim:
Um, okay.

48:32.977 --> 48:35.211
This-- here we go.

48:39.016 --> 48:43.085
Um, it's supposed to, uh--

48:43.087 --> 48:46.522
Uh, let me see here.
I apologize.

48:46.524 --> 48:48.624
That's all right.

48:51.094 --> 48:51.627
She cut it.

48:51.629 --> 48:53.996
Tim, why don't you do this.
Why don't you come back

48:53.998 --> 48:55.965
when your product
is more ready.

48:55.967 --> 48:56.999
Sir, I can explain.

48:57.001 --> 49:00.169
Let me just pop
through here.

49:03.206 --> 49:04.674
Get him out of here.

49:04.676 --> 49:06.342
Mr. topping:
Out of here.

49:06.344 --> 49:07.510
Get him out of here.

49:07.512 --> 49:11.314
Sir, i-- whoa! Whoa!
I didn't do that.
I can explain.

49:11.316 --> 49:12.515
I sure you can.
Do it from home.

49:12.517 --> 49:16.319
Tell your wife a village
is missing the idiot.

49:19.423 --> 49:21.023
Lawyer: I think our
chances look good.

49:21.025 --> 49:24.427
She's representing herself,
which is always a good thing.

49:24.429 --> 49:27.563
I think we have a really
good shot here.

49:27.565 --> 49:31.968
And it's always good, you know,
to have the upper hand.

49:34.271 --> 49:36.305
Ah, damn.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.507
Looks like she lawyered up.

49:38.509 --> 49:41.277
These guys
are 600 bucks an hour.

49:41.279 --> 49:43.379
They're big time lawyers.

49:43.381 --> 49:46.349
How can she afford
to pay them?

49:47.584 --> 49:49.018
You don't want to know.

49:49.020 --> 49:52.388
Let's just go to the
other room, okay?

49:59.262 --> 50:03.499
That's how we arrived
here to this point.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.701
So, what's the bottom line?

50:05.703 --> 50:07.670
The bottom line is that she...

50:07.672 --> 50:13.209
Is using and abusing
the system for profit.

50:14.077 --> 50:16.078
Your honor,
as you can see,

50:16.080 --> 50:18.080
the young lady
was hired as a nanny

50:18.082 --> 50:20.750
and her term of service
is clearly over.

50:20.752 --> 50:25.521
There's no reason not to Grant
the eviction to the Wells's.

50:26.189 --> 50:27.223
Lawyer: Thank you.

50:27.225 --> 50:30.192
Judge: Okay, Mr. Decker.
What's your response?

50:30.194 --> 50:31.060
Decker: Your honor,

50:31.062 --> 50:34.363
what Mr. Alden
failed to mention

50:34.365 --> 50:39.035
is the room was provided
in exchange for work.

50:39.369 --> 50:41.504
Work for which the Wells's

50:41.506 --> 50:44.707
did not even pay my client
minimum wage!

50:44.709 --> 50:49.512
After which, she was harassed.

50:49.514 --> 50:51.480
And fired.

50:51.482 --> 50:53.115
We have a police report

50:53.117 --> 50:58.287
detailing the illegal lockout
of my client.

50:58.289 --> 51:00.823
Decker: We also have proof

51:00.825 --> 51:05.494
of intimidation tactics.

51:06.196 --> 51:08.264
If I may.

51:09.466 --> 51:11.434
No more water. No more heat.
No more food, okay?

51:11.436 --> 51:15.137
You might be in that room now,
but I'm going to do whatever
it takes to get rid of you.

51:15.139 --> 51:18.207
Most importantly,
the three day notice

51:18.209 --> 51:21.243
posted on my client's door,

51:21.245 --> 51:22.511
it's defective.

51:22.513 --> 51:27.750
Here is the notice posted
on my client's door.

51:29.386 --> 51:31.253
Decker: As you can see,

51:31.255 --> 51:36.859
there's an extra "l" on the end
of miss Russell's name.

51:36.861 --> 51:39.161
That can't be.

51:39.163 --> 51:39.829
Judge: I have no choice.

51:39.831 --> 51:42.565
I'm ruling that the three day
notice is defective.

51:42.567 --> 51:46.335
You're going to start the
eviction process all over again.

51:46.337 --> 51:48.537
Over a typo? That's crazy!

51:48.539 --> 51:50.172
Look, that's the way it works.
I'm sorry.

51:50.174 --> 51:57.513
Decker: And we ask that
the Wells's pay all of my
client's legal fees.

51:57.515 --> 51:59.181
So ordered.

51:59.183 --> 52:01.484
Next case!

52:02.152 --> 52:04.153
That's how she affords
that lawyer.

52:04.155 --> 52:06.522
By making you pay
her court costs.

52:08.893 --> 52:11.594
Look, I can't do this.
I can do another six weeks
of this.

52:11.596 --> 52:15.865
Six weeks? Tim, Ken said
they can drag this out
for another year.

52:15.867 --> 52:18.534
Didn't Ken say something
about a quick eviction
or something

52:18.536 --> 52:21.403
-if she does something
illegal in the house?
-Forget it!

52:21.405 --> 52:23.205
-Tim!
-Forget what?! Huh?

52:23.207 --> 52:25.474
We're prisoners
in our own house!

52:25.476 --> 52:27.776
We're afraid to have our
children in the house!

52:27.778 --> 52:28.878
We're afraid to eat our food!

52:28.880 --> 52:33.482
-I think we should just
pay her off.
-Tim: Pay her off with what?

52:33.484 --> 52:36.819
You just lost your job!
I'm about to lose mine!

52:36.821 --> 52:40.456
And these bills are out the
roof because of her!

52:40.458 --> 52:43.893
-Why don't we just sell
the car. Or...
-Okay. Yeah.

52:43.895 --> 52:46.328
Let's sell the car.
Why don't we just
sell the house.

52:46.330 --> 52:48.564
Better yet, why don't we just
give the house to her, huh?

52:48.566 --> 52:52.768
I never wanted to live here
in the first place.

52:55.839 --> 53:00.242
Kyle: So, it looks like
you won, right?

53:00.244 --> 53:01.477
Jen: Mmhmm.

53:01.479 --> 53:04.680
And I really helped you.

53:04.682 --> 53:05.347
Right?

53:05.349 --> 53:09.585
I mean with showing
you the cameras and

53:09.587 --> 53:13.756
hacking into Mr. Wells'
presentation and all.

53:13.758 --> 53:17.326
It's sort of like...
You owe me.

53:17.328 --> 53:18.527
Please.

53:18.529 --> 53:23.332
You're going to have to do
a lot more than that
to get my "thanks."

53:24.401 --> 53:26.769
Man. You are such a bitch.

53:26.771 --> 53:30.673
Kyle: You pretend to be nice
to get what you want but--

53:32.842 --> 53:34.777
actually.

53:34.779 --> 53:35.511
You know...

53:35.513 --> 53:39.748
I can always tell 'em
what I know about you.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.417
Really?

53:42.852 --> 53:43.886
And what is that?

53:43.888 --> 53:47.990
I know about that creepy
boyfriend of yours.

53:47.992 --> 53:49.792
That he's, like,
a drug dealer.

53:49.794 --> 53:53.796
And he's always
giving you drugs.

53:54.598 --> 53:57.800
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

53:57.802 --> 53:59.435
Why not?

54:02.005 --> 54:06.408
Trust me.
You don't want to know.

54:12.415 --> 54:18.454
Right? Can you just--
no, that's not the person
that I talked to.

54:18.456 --> 54:20.556
No, I wasn't--

54:20.857 --> 54:22.524
no. I can't hold, okay?

54:22.526 --> 54:24.293
This has gone on
way too long.

54:24.295 --> 54:27.296
We've been here for weeks
and our mail is not coming.

54:27.298 --> 54:30.466
And now I'm really upset
about it because this is...

54:30.468 --> 54:34.670
I keep getting the run-around
with all of this.

54:36.773 --> 54:40.009
211 maple.

54:43.546 --> 54:46.048
Yes, I'll hold.

54:46.050 --> 54:47.016
Yo, Tim!

54:47.018 --> 54:47.916
What's up, Kyle?

54:47.918 --> 54:48.984
Man. That guy is such a creep.

54:48.986 --> 54:51.654
I can't believe you let
him into your home.

54:51.656 --> 54:52.621
Yeah, not my choice.

54:52.623 --> 54:55.824
Yeah, I get it.
It's all about what she wants.

54:55.826 --> 54:57.760
Such a bitch.

54:57.762 --> 54:59.928
And a complete user.

54:59.930 --> 55:01.664
In more ways than one.

55:01.666 --> 55:03.499
What do you mean,
like drugs?

55:03.501 --> 55:05.868
Yeah.
You didn't know that?

55:05.870 --> 55:06.935
That guy
is like a total dealer.

55:06.937 --> 55:11.407
He's always giving her something
to shoot, snort, or whatever.

55:11.409 --> 55:12.508
I mean, look at it this way.

55:12.510 --> 55:18.013
Do you really think she's
doing him for free?

55:19.416 --> 55:22.351
Oh my god.

55:22.353 --> 55:26.655
Jen: That's okay. We'll get
him back next time.

55:35.365 --> 55:37.566
Jen: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

55:44.541 --> 55:45.774
See ya.

55:45.776 --> 55:47.409
Oh!

56:20.677 --> 56:24.079
-hey! What are you
doing in here?
-Oh! No, no, no, no.

56:24.081 --> 56:25.414
No messing with the evidence.

56:25.416 --> 56:27.149
I got you now.
I'm calling the cops.

56:27.151 --> 56:30.986
Illegal activity means
immediate eviction.

56:35.658 --> 56:38.627
Just let me in my room.
This is ridiculous.

56:38.629 --> 56:39.561
Absolutely not.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.964
-No way.
-Thank god you're here.
He was filming me naked

56:41.966 --> 56:45.000
-and he won't let me
back in my room.
-That's bullshit.

56:45.002 --> 56:46.769
She's got illegal drugs
on her night stand.

56:46.771 --> 56:49.705
I saw her on the bed
shooting up with a needle
in her arm.

56:49.707 --> 56:52.574
I saw it. I got the whole
thing on tape.

56:52.576 --> 56:54.176
Right here.

56:57.013 --> 56:59.882
<i> -Jen: What are you doing</i>
<i> in here?</i>
<i> - Tim: Oh! No, no, no, no.</i>

56:59.884 --> 57:02.084
<i> No messing with the evidence,</i>
<i> all right?</i>

57:02.086 --> 57:03.485
<i> I'm calling the cops.</i>

57:03.487 --> 57:05.788
<i> Illegal activity means</i>
<i> immediate eviction.</i>

57:05.790 --> 57:09.057
<i> Jen: Just leave me alone.</i>
<i> Get out.</i>

57:09.759 --> 57:12.661
-Go check things out in there.
-Yeah. Go ahead.

57:12.663 --> 57:13.662
Right on the night stand.

57:13.664 --> 57:17.466
-Everything's right in there.
-Come here, ma'am.

57:18.067 --> 57:19.168
That's all I found.

57:19.170 --> 57:21.603
Yeah, you mean my
medication for my diabetes?

57:21.605 --> 57:25.774
I was just diagnosed last week.
I can show you the receipt
from my pharmacy

57:25.776 --> 57:28.444
-for my prescription.
-What? No, no, no, no.

57:28.446 --> 57:30.179
Mr. Wells!
You realize this is Insulin.

57:30.181 --> 57:32.481
So you're just gonna film
her while she's unclothed

57:32.483 --> 57:34.116
and then you're gonna
trespass in her room?

57:34.118 --> 57:35.617
No, no.
I saw her on her bed.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.019
Get him out of here.
Get him out of here.

57:37.021 --> 57:38.821
Tim:
With her drug dealer boyfriend.

57:38.823 --> 57:41.457
She had a needle in her arm.
Sitting on the bed.

57:41.459 --> 57:43.892
Cop: You have the right
to remain silent.

57:43.894 --> 57:45.461
I'm really sorry
for the inconvenience.

57:45.463 --> 57:47.563
Is there anything else
we can help you with?

57:47.565 --> 57:50.866
No. Just...
Thanks for coming.

57:53.203 --> 57:58.607
You guys are making a big
mistake. You have no idea
what's going on here.

58:01.077 --> 58:02.744
The girl is nuts.

58:02.746 --> 58:04.980
We see this all the time.

58:04.982 --> 58:09.985
I can't believe that
he was coming in my room
and filming me.

58:21.831 --> 58:24.766
I want a restraining order.

58:24.934 --> 58:28.270
I don't want him
anywhere near me.

58:29.072 --> 58:29.805
Tim! Tim, honey.

58:29.807 --> 58:32.274
What are you doing?
What happened? Tim,
what happened?

58:32.276 --> 58:34.510
-What happened?
-Ma'am, I need you
to please back up.

58:34.512 --> 58:36.979
-What is happening?
-Just back up, ma'am.
I need you to back up!

58:36.981 --> 58:43.585
-Why is my husband in that car?
-I need you to back up for
a moment, ma'am. Please.

58:51.694 --> 58:55.831
Now, that little performance
of yours was very helpful.

58:55.833 --> 58:59.001
My pleasure.

58:59.969 --> 59:01.637
Right?

59:02.539 --> 59:04.172
Yeah.

59:19.956 --> 59:20.689
all right.

59:20.691 --> 59:24.993
I'll call back later this
afternoon. Thank you, officer.

59:26.296 --> 59:27.963
Look fay,
I've done all I could here.

59:27.965 --> 59:32.834
It's just that he's really
going to need a criminal
attorney.

59:33.202 --> 59:35.837
Look, I want to be
straight with you.

59:35.839 --> 59:37.973
You need to be prepared
for a big lawsuit here.

59:37.975 --> 59:41.810
She's going to come after
you in civil court for this.

59:41.812 --> 59:45.681
I've seen all this kind of
thing before, you understand?

59:45.683 --> 59:49.151
It's what she wanted all along.
It's a big payday.

59:50.320 --> 59:54.823
Just tell me,
when can he come home?

59:55.024 --> 59:55.958
He can't come home.

59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.996
His arraignment is tomorrow
but she has a restraining
order against him.

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:04.099
He can't come anywhere
near the house.

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:09.071
Look, I know this is
difficult for you.

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:12.874
But in the end, it's all
going to be okay.

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:15.711
I promise.

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:29.891
Hey fay!

01:00:29.893 --> 01:00:32.160
Join the party.

01:00:32.162 --> 01:00:34.262
No?

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:36.798
Poor fay.

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:39.768
You should have just
paid me off.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.971
I might have just left.
But now...

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.407
I kinda like it here.

01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:50.012
You know, with all of grandma's
little knickknacks.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:50.979
Hey fay!

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:53.415
We're almost out of wine.

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:54.750
Don't worry.

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:58.286
I already put it on the list.

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:08.430
there you go, Allan.
Eat up.

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:11.266
You too, Timothy.

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.803
Thanks, grandma.

01:01:14.805 --> 01:01:17.105
Yeah. Thanks, mom.
Thanks for having us here too.

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:19.141
Oh, honey, I love having
you guys here.

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:22.177
I just wish that fay
could be here too.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:24.046
Daddy, where is mommy?

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.213
Mommy's at home, buddy.

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:28.183
Actually, I'm going call
mommy right now. Okay?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:32.187
Tim: Eat your pancakes,
all right? Eat up.

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:35.023
Are those pancakes good?

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.025
Fay:
Tim, everything all right?

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:40.295
Yeah. I just don't understand
why you can't come here.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:41.430
There's plenty of space.

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:44.433
Tim: Babe, just
please consider coming.

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:48.336
Tim: The kids want you here.
 I want you here, too.

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:51.807
I just don't want you
in the house all alone.
It's not safe.

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:55.110
But, I do need to be here.
Someone has to.

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:56.244
And now that you can't...

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:59.915
Look, I know. I know.
I'm sorry, okay? I just--

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:03.318
look, I know--
you were right all along.
She played me.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.354
Okay, but, I don't--
we'll just pay her off, okay?

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:09.324
All right? We'll sell everything
we have to get her out.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:11.226
The car.
The house if we have to.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:13.061
Your cousin always
had an eye on it.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.262
So maybe we can just
sell it to her.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:16.932
Tim! It's too late for that.
Don't you get it?

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:19.968
Even if we wanted to we
couldn't sell the house now.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:22.337
No one will buy it with a
problem tenant like Jen!

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:26.374
We're going to have to take her
to court to get her out.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:30.746
-Fay. Fay. Hey.
-I have to go.

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:42.090
Well, the paperwork appears
to be in order this time.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:46.128
And as miss Russell
didn't bother to show up
in court today,

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:50.198
I see no reason
not to Grant the eviction.

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:55.203
Your honor, I'm so sorry.
But the bus was late--

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:56.471
judge: It's okay.

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:59.975
Miss Russell, nice of you
to make an appearance.

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:01.943
But unfortunately,
you're too late.

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:05.080
I've just granted the Wells's
an eviction.

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:08.550
But your honor, I have proof
that I filed for bankruptcy.

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:10.886
-Wait, what does that mean?
-Ken: Your honor! Please.

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:13.021
Miss Russell is trying
to game the system!

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:15.323
She obviously filed
for bankruptcy

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:18.160
in order to halt
the eviction.

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:21.530
Judge: She actually filed these
papers a couple of weeks ago.

01:03:21.532 --> 01:03:25.100
I'm sorry,
but in light of the recent
bankruptcy filings,

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:30.305
I have no choice
but to Grant an automatic
stay on the eviction.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:31.940
Judge: Next case!

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:36.411
-What is this?
-I'm sorry,
she found a loophole.

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:39.481
Ken: I did the best I could.
I'm sorry.

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.355
Hey, what just happened
in there?

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:49.224
Filing for bankruptcy gives
tenants certain rights

01:03:49.226 --> 01:03:52.294
they wouldn't normally have.
It puts a stop to all evictions.

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:55.096
Okay, so when do we get her
out? When does she leave?

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:57.899
Ken: It may be hard to say.
I'm gonna file a motion

01:03:57.901 --> 01:03:59.267
in bankruptcy court
to lift the stay.

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:02.337
But in my experience,
it's another 2 months or so.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:05.307
Tim: Two-- what?

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:06.575
Tim: Hey fay.

01:04:06.577 --> 01:04:07.309
Hey. Come here.

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:10.245
-Easy. Easy.
-How did this happen?

01:04:10.247 --> 01:04:13.114
Why is this happening to us?

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:15.550
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:17.919
Tim: Just relax.

01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:22.524
Fay:
I just wanted to give our kids
a nice house.

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:24.492
Tim: I know.

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:25.994
I know. Just breathe.

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:28.296
Okay. Calm down.

01:04:28.298 --> 01:04:30.565
Just breathe.

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:37.539
Tim. No. That's just not
gonna work.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:40.175
Fay, listen,
i really think it could.

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:41.409
Ken was talking about
some company

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:43.178
that specializes in this.
It's called "dumping."

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:47.949
They buy the house from
us at a discounted price.
And then Jen's their problem.

01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:50.552
Fay: Tim, I grew up
in that house.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:54.456
I can't just have her
take it from me.

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:55.323
And from our family.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:59.160
Tim:
Look, I know that it was
your grandmother's house.

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:01.096
Okay? But she always
said that

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:04.099
family was the most important
thing in this life.

01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:07.068
Tim: She'd understand.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:08.503
Fine.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:12.007
Do whatever you have to do.

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:18.446
Thanks.

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:23.218
I'm sorry.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:26.521
I know someone
who has that same tattoo.

01:05:26.523 --> 01:05:29.224
Must be pretty common,
i guess.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:31.092
No.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:34.262
No. It's the exact
same tattoo.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.165
In the same spot.

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:37.599
Betsy.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:41.636
Would you mind
finishing this up.
I'm going to take my break.

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:44.172
Fay: No--

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:45.607
fay: Excuse me.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.609
I really-- I really need
to talk to you.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:50.979
- I can't talk right now.
- I...

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.681
I-i-- please. I just--

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:57.452
if you could just
talk to me for just a minute.

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:07.028
- Please. It will only
take a minute.
-You can't be back here.

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:13.234
Listen. Just, please.

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:14.069
Listen to me.

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:17.072
A few months ago I came
in here with my nanny.

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:18.573
And you called her
by a different name.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:23.011
-I thought maybe you
just might know--
-i don't. I don't remember.

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:24.012
I'm really sorry.

01:06:24.014 --> 01:06:27.182
Please. Please.
This is important.

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:28.450
If you know anything...

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:31.319
Girl:
I don't know anything.
Just please leave me alone.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:35.557
If Alexa thinks I'm talking,
she'll kill me.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.329
Alexa.

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:00.749
Fay:
Yeah, I've got everything.

01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:04.085
I'll meet you at the
realtors at 9:00.

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:05.553
Okay.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.775
Useless.

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:36.317
Tim?

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:37.352
Yeah.

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:39.220
I think I'm going
to be late.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.755
I got to run
to the supermarket.

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:44.626
I think I know someone there
who knows who our nanny
really is.

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:48.129
No.

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:50.131
No, no, no, no, no!

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.100
What's going on?

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.769
- I need your car.
- Forget about it.

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:58.373
I've seen the way you drive
and before you threaten me,

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:01.409
keep in mind that you just
had sex with a minor,

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:05.447
which, I still think
is a crime.

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:11.352
Give me the keys.

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:14.155
What are you gonna do,
stab me?

01:08:14.825 --> 01:08:19.661
-What did you do?
-You should have just
given me the keys.

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:21.595
-Come on. Let's go.
-Kyle: I can't move my arm.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:27.167
-Just leave me.
I won't tell. I swear.
-Let's go. Come on.

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.339
Let's go for a little ride.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:34.542
Jen, I need
to get to a doctor.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:37.511
Sure. We'll get you there.

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:38.279
In the trunk.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:40.148
I'm not getting in there.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.716
Did I stutter?

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:44.319
Get in the trunk!

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:49.457
Jesus. Jen!

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:55.395
Shut up!

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:13.148
Alexa:
Hey wren. We need to talk.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:17.218
I can't, Alexa.
I have work.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.321
Alexa: Just get in the car.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.426
Cashier: Okay.
There you go.

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:27.629
Thank you.
Have a good day now.

01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:28.529
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yeah.

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:30.331
I'm looking for a girl
who works here.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.300
She has a butterfly
tattoo on her wrist.

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:33.868
Oh yeah. Who isn't.

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:35.336
Must be talking
about wren.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.537
-Wren?
-Wren roullen.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:40.207
Yeah. She just went on break
and never came back.

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:40.642
Kids.

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:43.912
Do you by any chance know
anything about wren?

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:45.546
Where she's from?

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:48.616
Uh, she's from a small town
nearby.

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.818
Sugar...Sugar grove.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:51.553
Sugar grove.

01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:53.787
-Thank you!
Thank you very much!
-Sure.

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:57.358
If you find her,
tell her she's fired!

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:13.908
Fay: Hi.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:15.910
I was hoping you could
help me.

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:18.479
I work downstairs.
I'm searching for a girl

01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:21.249
who used to live
in a town nearby.

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:22.650
Sugar grove,
i think it's called.

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:26.654
I know her name is Alexa
and I'm guessing she went
to school there.

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:32.493
Is there any way that I can
search through the high school
yearbooks by name?

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:36.831
No. I'm afraid we haven't
got that facility here.

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:39.300
But, I do know
that we've got

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:41.569
every copy
of the town's yearbook.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:45.006
And they go back
to the early 1950s.

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:47.675
Actually,
i know she was friends

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:51.312
with a girl
named wren roullen.

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:52.313
Fay: This girl.

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:54.949
Oh, yeah. I recognize her.
I mean, she was the young girl

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:56.751
that was involved
in that house fire.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:59.587
About five years ago.
It was terrible.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:00.021
A fire?

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:01.789
Yes. It was a young
teenage girl

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.492
and she set fire
to the family foster home.

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:08.429
Do you know the name
of the young girl?

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.498
Sadly, no.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.399
But, let me think.

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:14.335
You could look up
the newspaper articles
that covered that time period.

01:11:14.337 --> 01:11:18.840
And I know that we've
got those on the microfiche
in the back office.

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:21.609
Follow me.
I'll show you.

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:25.346
Fay: Great.

01:11:25.348 --> 01:11:28.016
-Here you go.
-Thank you so much.

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:30.818
And if it helps at all,
it was five years ago.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.956
I'm pretty certain that the fire
took place in the summer months.

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:37.558
So I would start
your search, say...

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.561
July-August, five years ago.

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:43.298
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.852
Fay: Alexa dodge.

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:10.892
Gotcha.

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.505
Please. Just take a look
at the photo.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.108
You can see that it is
the same woman that has
been living in my house.

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:31.679
I don't know, ma'am.
I need this by the end
of the day.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:32.714
Please, just--

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:35.483
just look at the tattoo
on her wrist.

01:12:35.485 --> 01:12:38.986
I'm telling you.
Alexa dodge is Jen Russell.

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:42.623
Her friend at the market even
called her by that name.

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:44.659
And what's the name
of this friend?

01:12:44.661 --> 01:12:45.426
Wren roullen.

01:12:45.428 --> 01:12:49.530
She works at Sam's market.
I just don't think
she's on today.

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:52.467
I'll look into it.

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:54.769
Thank you.

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:08.783
Where are we, Alexa?
This looks like the desert.

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:10.485
Stop calling me that!

01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:11.753
I told you
I'm not Alexa anymore.

01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:16.157
Sorry, just please listen.
I didn't tell that lady
anything.

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:17.592
I wouldn't.

01:13:17.594 --> 01:13:21.462
Let me out and I will never
go back to that town, ever.

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:22.730
It's okay.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:25.466
I believe you.

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:30.171
Only thing is, it doesn't
really matter anymore!

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:37.678
Wren! Stop!

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:53.694
Officer: Your house is clean,
Mrs. Wells.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:54.796
There's no one inside.

01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:59.500
We'll leave a cop car out front
just in case she comes back.

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.904
You believe me now?

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:06.641
We dusted the room for prints
and certified

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.976
that Jen Russell
is actually Alexa dodge.

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:12.547
And she's actually wanted
for arson and homicide.

01:14:12.549 --> 01:14:14.782
<i> -Officer Seymour.</i>
- Excuse me.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.784
<i> We got a call</i>
<i> for an overturned vehicle.</i>

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:19.120
<i> I think we found the kids</i>
<i> you were looking for.</i>

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:20.521
<i> We ID'd Alexa dodge.</i>

01:14:20.523 --> 01:14:22.657
<i> She's been pronounced dead.</i>

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:24.125
Copy.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.628
You can stop worrying,
Mrs. Wells.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.198
They found Alexa dodge.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.066
She's dead.

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:35.069
She's dead?

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:36.604
Car accident.

01:14:36.606 --> 01:14:38.806
Her and the neighbor,
Kyle Benson.

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:45.246
He was severely injured
but he did verify that Jen
stole the car and crashed it.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.852
Oh, wow.

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:52.653
I have to call my husband.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:56.924
And tell him that he and the
kids can come home, right?

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:00.962
Sure.

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:04.565
Thank you.

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.234
Alexa: Can you get
me to pinewood?

01:15:40.236 --> 01:15:42.770
Driver: Hope on in.

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:58.185
Tim: Come here, buddy.

01:15:58.187 --> 01:15:59.854
Come here.

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:05.860
So mommy, can we stay with
you guys from now on?

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:07.862
Of course you can, honey.

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:09.797
This is your house.

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:11.732
And can I have ice cream?

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:17.705
I will get you a new bowl.

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:40.061
Did you hear that?

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:42.063
Hear what?

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:45.866
Never mind.

01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:50.771
Look at what I have.

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:55.643
All right, Allan, honey.
Are you ready for bed?

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.912
-Mmhmm.
-Okay.

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:04.619
Tim: Probably just a fuse.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:06.120
Tim: I'll go check it out, okay?
-Allan: Mmhmm.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:12.293
It's okay, honey.
It's probably something wrong
with the fuses.

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:27.642
Wade: What's up?

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.952
There's nothing
to be scared of.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:41.088
That's what Jen said.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.023
Jen?

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:44.659
You mean, when she was
your nanny?

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.193
Mm-mm.

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:49.130
But, honey.
We explained this.

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:52.700
She's not coming back.
She's gone.

01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:55.936
She was just right here.

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:03.144
Allan. Come on.
Let's go find your dad.

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:06.207
Alexa: This is all your
fault, fay.

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:09.343
You should have just...

01:19:09.345 --> 01:19:12.413
Paid me off,
like all the others.

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:15.983
But no...

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:22.423
You had to go nosing
around in my past.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.392
Alexa: So now,

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:28.295
you're going to pay.

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:32.166
You like this house so much.

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:34.401
Then guess what?

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:37.438
You're never going to leave.

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.342
You...

01:19:41.344 --> 01:19:43.344
Or Allan.

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:48.149
I'll find Caleb.

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:49.483
Please, Jen.

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:52.219
Alexa, please.
Let the kids go.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:55.156
They didn't do anything wrong.

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:12.072
That doesn't matter.

01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:16.477
See, this is a good lesson
to learn, Allan.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:20.214
Life's not fair.

01:20:20.216 --> 01:20:22.283
I mean, just look at me.

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:25.920
I never did anything wrong.

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:31.559
Yet, they moved me
from foster house to house,

01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:34.595
to house. It was--

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:37.298
it was like a safari dinner.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.368
-Except it was my life.
-Fay: Alexa.

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:45.139
Alexa, I know.
I know it wasn't fair.

01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:46.073
I'll make it right.

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:50.477
I'll sign over the house to you.
I'll do anything.

01:20:52.415 --> 01:20:55.916
How dumb do you
think I am?

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:58.986
There's nothing
but a whole bunch of
old bullshit in here.

01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:01.455
Where's the good stuff,
bitch?

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:04.258
Wade: Oh, you don't know.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.861
- I don't know.
- You know something.

01:21:06.863 --> 01:21:09.330
Fay: No. I don't.

01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:11.632
Wade: Oh, you don't?

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.100
Oh, god.
No, okay, okay.

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:15.603
I know what you want.
I know what you want.
Downstairs.

01:21:15.605 --> 01:21:18.572
My grandmother's
collectables. Please.

01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:20.641
Please.

01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:22.209
I knew it.

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:24.144
And you better not
be lying, bitch.

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:28.015
No, no. It's downstairs.

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:54.575
Officer: Mrs. Wells,
it's officer Seymour.

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:59.113
We just learned that the body
ID'd as Alexa dodge was really
wren roullen.

01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:02.516
Lock all your doors.
We're on our way.

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:07.354
-This is your fault, bitch!
- No, no, no, no.

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:29.610
Please. Please.
You could still run.
You can still go.

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:31.345
You'll be safe.
Just go. Just--

01:22:31.347 --> 01:22:36.317
-i need a hostage. Come on!
Let him go! Let him go.
-No!

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:40.254
Alexa: Let me have him
or I'll kill him.

01:22:40.256 --> 01:22:43.190
If you follow me,

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:45.426
he's done.

01:22:47.163 --> 01:22:48.028
Please.

01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:50.364
Police:
Let the boy go. Alexa dodge--

01:22:50.366 --> 01:22:53.167
Alexa:
Allan, get to the tree house.

01:22:53.169 --> 01:22:54.335
Come on. Let's go.

01:22:54.337 --> 01:22:57.271
Police: To the tree out
front there! Go! Go!

01:22:57.273 --> 01:23:00.374
Allan!

01:23:17.059 --> 01:23:18.158
Oh! Oh--

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.329
You shot me!

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.598
Officer: You okay?

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.700
You're safe now.

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:30.170
Fay: Jen!

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:31.672
Allan!

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:34.241
Please.

01:23:34.243 --> 01:23:37.378
Hey, this is your fault,
fay.

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.712
You should have just
butted out!

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:42.750
Alexa: I can't let them take
me again! I can't go back.

01:23:43.651 --> 01:23:45.786
Let Allan go.

01:23:45.788 --> 01:23:48.222
You don't understand.

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:51.058
I have nowhere to go.

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:53.127
This is it for me.

01:23:53.129 --> 01:23:53.727
Fay: It's okay.

01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:55.562
Everything's going to be okay.

01:23:55.564 --> 01:23:59.800
I'm going to get you the help
that you need. Please.

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:06.240
Police: Alexa dodge!
Drop the knife!

01:24:06.242 --> 01:24:08.242
Alexa, just...

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:11.178
Please let him go.

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:19.820
Fay: Allan, honey.

01:24:19.822 --> 01:24:23.724
Go down to the cops
down there.

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:32.399
I don't understand
why no one ever loved me
like that.

01:24:34.702 --> 01:24:36.603
Alexa: No one ever did.

01:24:36.605 --> 01:24:38.839
Oh, god--
oh, god, Alexa!

01:24:38.841 --> 01:24:42.509
Fay:
No! No! Alexa! No!

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:45.846
Even my mom didn't want me.

01:24:45.848 --> 01:24:47.381
That's not true.
That's a lie.

01:24:47.383 --> 01:24:52.586
My foster mom told me
my mom couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:56.457
-I was bad from the start.
-No. Alexa.

01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:58.792
No, your mother loved you.
She got sick.

01:24:58.794 --> 01:25:03.330
She had to give you up.
She couldn't take care of you.

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:05.365
No, you're lying.

01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:08.168
No! I'm not lying.
I can prove it.

01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:12.339
I have proof, please.

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.342
No!

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:18.178
No!

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:21.648
Fay:
I'm not gonna let you go.

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:46.440
Alexa!

01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:50.844
I'll get you that article
about your mother.

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:54.314
Fay:
It will explain everything.

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:57.317
It's going to be okay.

Officer:
All right, come on.

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:15.369
Allan: So now we're moving
back to live near grandma?
In another new house?

01:26:15.371 --> 01:26:19.806
Yeah, honey. We're selling
that house to my cousin
and her husband.

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:21.508
So we're going to move
closer to grandma.

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:23.610
Just, you know,
in a smaller house.

01:26:23.612 --> 01:26:26.180
Allan: And Jen?
Where will she live?

01:26:26.182 --> 01:26:28.182
Fay: Jen's getting the help
that she needs.

01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:32.753
She's got a room all to herself.
It's really nice.
