22:56.375 --> 22:58.460
{\an8}[indistinct]

22:58.543 --> 22:59.419
{\an8}[laughter]

23:02.923 --> 23:03.632
{\an8}- SMELLS BAD IN HERE!

23:03.715 --> 23:05.300
{\an8}- WHY DOES IT SMELL SO BAD?

23:05.384 --> 23:06.635
{\an8}- SMELLS BAD IN THERE.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.678
{\an8}- YO, THE CAB'S HERE.

23:08.762 --> 23:09.513
{\an8}EVERYBODY, COME ON.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.764
{\an8}- WE'RE HEADING TO BOWLING.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.933
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA, YOU KNOW,
DO SOMETHING TOGETHER,

23:13.016 --> 23:15.143
{\an8}FUN, AN ACTIVITY THAT WE
HAVEN'T DONE BEFORE.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.311
{\an8}SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.063
{\an8}- WE'RE ALL IN?
- YEP.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.483
{\an8}- WHO DID?
- MIKE.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.777
{\an8}- OH, THAT'S WHY
IT SMELLS IN THERE?

23:23.860 --> 23:25.237
{\an8}- MIKE JUST TOLD ME AT WORK.
SHH.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.988
{\an8}MIKE JUST TOLD ME AT WORK.
WE DIDN'T KNOW.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.115
{\an8}DON'T--DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.116
{\an8}I NEVER TOLD YOU.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.575
{\an8}- YOU NEVER TOLD ME,
DON'T WORRY.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.160
{\an8}I'LL GET HIM BACK.
- GET HIM, PLEASE.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.620
{\an8}CAN YOU?
WHY DO YOU THINK I WAS GOING,

23:33.703 --> 23:35.122
{\an8}"YO, IT SMELLS LIKE
CHEDDAR CHEESE."

23:35.205 --> 23:35.956
{\an8}- I LIKE YOU, AND I HOPE IF
THEY EVER DO ANYTHING TO ME,

23:36.039 --> 23:38.583
{\an8}YOU WOULD TELL ME.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.709
{\an8}[laughter]

23:39.793 --> 23:41.336
{\an8}SHAKE THAT ONE OFF, JENNI!

23:45.090 --> 23:47.134
{\an8}- I JUST WANT A STRIKE.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.052
{\an8}- I'M REALLY EXCITED.
I LOVE BOWLING.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.763
{\an8}SO I WANT TO, LIKE,
SCHOOL ALL THESE KIDS.

23:51.847 --> 23:52.681
{\an8}OH, MAN.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.558
{\an8}[laughing]
YOU JINX ME EVERY TIME.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.193
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT
OF TENSION WITH ME AND MIKE.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.028
{\an8}AND WE ONLY HAVE, LIKE,
LESS THAN A WEEK AND A HALF.

24:07.112 --> 24:11.533
{\an8}SO I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE
ME AND MIKE ARE ON CIVIL TERMS.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.702
{\an8}I DON'T THINK WE NEED
ANY MORE FIGHTING IN THE HOUSE.

24:13.785 --> 24:17.247
{\an8}- NO, NO, YOU HIT ME
REALLY GOOD AFTER THE CLUB.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.874
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT I WAS, LIKE,
AT THE CLUB, I WENT LIKE THIS.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.375
{\an8}THEN YOU KICKED ME OUT.
YOU WERE LIKE, "BYE."

24:20.458 --> 24:21.710
{\an8}- YOU GOTTA ADMIT THAT YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.921
{\an8}- WHAT YOU DID AT THE NIGHTCLUB
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.799
{\an8}I WAS LIKE,
"PLEASE BRING ME HOME.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.217
{\an8}"I'M THROWING UP.
PLEASE.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.844
{\an8}I NEED YOU."

24:30.927 --> 24:32.387
{\an8}AND YOU WERE LIKE,
"[bleep] YOU, LIKE..."

24:32.471 --> 24:33.680
{\an8}- I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T SAY--
- GET OUT OF MY FACE.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.057
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO, NO.
I DIDN'T SAY, "[bleep] YOU."

24:36.141 --> 24:37.225
{\an8}I MIGHT HAVE
PUT THE HAND UP.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.275
{\an8}YOU SMACKED ME, 'CAUSE YOU
SHOULD HAVE NEVER SMACKED ME.

24:45.358 --> 24:46.484
{\an8}I WAS WITH SOME CHICK.

24:46.568 --> 24:47.569
{\an8}- THIS IS HOW I LOOK AT IT.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.029
{\an8}YOU HAD 40 MINUTES
LEFT AT THE CLUB.

24:49.112 --> 24:49.905
{\an8}YOUR ROOMMATE IS THROWING UP,

24:49.988 --> 24:51.448
{\an8}BEGGING YOU
TO BRING HER BACK.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.033
{\an8}- THERE WERE
OTHER ROOMMATES THERE.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.327
{\an8}I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU--
- IT WAS YOU AND PAULY.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.163
{\an8}- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
LOOK TO ME AS A FATHER FIGURE.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.164
{\an8}I'M JOKING, I'M JOKING.
- HA! YOU ARE.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.458
{\an8}- MAYBE I DIDN'T NOTICE

25:01.541 --> 25:03.251
{\an8}THE SEVERITY
OF HOW SICK YOU WERE.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.461
{\an8}BUT I NEVER SAID
ANYTHING MEAN TO YOU

25:04.544 --> 25:05.587
{\an8}UNTIL YOU SMACKED ME.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.796
{\an8}WHATEVER, WHATEVER.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.590
{\an8}EVERYBODY HAD A LOT
OF ALCOHOL THAT DAY.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.508
{\an8}WE'LL TRY TO [bleep]
CHILL IT OUT,

25:10.592 --> 25:11.927
{\an8}AND THEN WE'LL SEE.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.887
{\an8}JENNI, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S GOT A GOOD LEFT PUNCH,

25:13.970 --> 25:15.597
{\an8}SO, YOU KNOW, JUST GONNA
WATCH OUT FOR THAT.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.057
{\an8}- I HIT YOU HARD, THOUGH?

25:17.140 --> 25:17.891
{\an8}- [laughing]
YOU DID, YOU DID.

25:17.974 --> 25:21.144
{\an8}- SORRY.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.479
{\an8}- THAT WAS FUN.
- YOU GUYS BOWLED GOOD.

25:22.562 --> 25:25.649
{\an8}- WHO'S GOT THE COUPON
FOR THE TAXI?

25:29.527 --> 25:30.528
{\an8}- MIKE TRIED TO PLAY
A PRANK ON ME.

25:30.612 --> 25:33.740
{\an8}HE TRIED TO PUT CHEESE,
MIXED IN A BOWL,

25:33.823 --> 25:34.616
{\an8}UNDER MY BED
AND LEAVE IT THERE.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.285
{\an8}[liquid trickling,
toilet flushes]

25:37.369 --> 25:38.995
{\an8}IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T
FRUSTRATE ME.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.789
{\an8}I LIKE WHEN PEOPLE
[bleep] WITH ME

25:40.872 --> 25:42.540
{\an8}BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO GET THEM BACK,

25:42.624 --> 25:44.459
{\an8}AND TO GET THEM BACK
EVEN HARDER.

25:44.542 --> 25:45.293
{\an8}I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET THIS [bleep].

25:45.377 --> 25:47.587
{\an8}YO, MIKE, YOU'RE DONE.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.631
{\an8}- YOU STILL HAVE NOT
BROUGHT HOME A GIRL

25:49.714 --> 25:51.007
{\an8}BETTER-LOOKING THAN SAM.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.802
{\an8}- DON'T LIE SAM, 'CAUSE
I HOOKED UP WITH YOU FIRST!

25:53.885 --> 25:55.971
{\an8}- WHO GIVES A [bleep]
IF I HELD YOUR HAND?

25:56.054 --> 25:57.639
{\an8}I'M DONE WITH
THIS BULL[bleep]!

25:57.722 --> 25:59.057
{\an8}- WHAT'S SO WRONG
WITH MEETING GUYS AT THE CLUB

25:59.140 --> 26:00.183
{\an8}AND KISSING THEM?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.145
{\an8}LIKE, I JUST WANNA FIND A GUY
THAT WANTS TO SETTLE DOWN.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.982
{\an8}LIKE, HAVE A COMMITMENT.

26:09.901 --> 26:10.986

UNDER YOUR BED.

26:11.069 --> 26:15.323
{\an8}[toilet flushes]

26:15.407 --> 26:17.617

[bleep] VINNY'S ROOM

26:17.701 --> 26:19.244
{\an8}SMELLS SO BAD.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.371
{\an8}- COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
WHY DOES MY ROOM SMELL?

26:21.454 --> 26:24.708
{\an8}'CAUSE OF MY CLOTHES?
WHY?

26:24.791 --> 26:25.792
{\an8}OH, WAIT...

26:25.875 --> 26:27.168
{\an8}- SMELLS--
- WHY DOES IT SMELL SO BAD?

26:27.252 --> 26:29.337
{\an8}- SMELLS BAD IN THERE.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.219
{\an8}- I THINK YOUR ROOM
WAS SO DIRTY,

26:36.303 --> 26:37.429
{\an8}YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS UNDER HERE.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.264
{\an8}- I KNOW, MAN.
- IT'S PROBABLY IN THAT [bleep].

26:39.347 --> 26:41.308
{\an8}- I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE
SOME KIND OF BOWL OR SOMETHING

26:41.391 --> 26:42.517
{\an8}UNDER MY BED.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.145
{\an8}- SOMETIMES RATS KEEP EXTRA
FOOD UNDER THE BED.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.563
{\an8}- DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THAT HAPPENED TO ME,

26:46.646 --> 26:47.689
{\an8}'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
UNDER MY BED.

26:47.772 --> 26:48.773

IT WAS THERE, THOUGH.

{\an8}- BUT IT'S NOT THERE RIGHT NOW,
AND YOUR JOKE DIDN'T WORK.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.198
{\an8}- YEAH, IT DID WORK, 'CAUSE
IT SMELLED PRETTY BAD IN HERE

26:57.282 --> 26:59.951
{\an8}IN THE LAST DAY OR TWO.
- OKAY. FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT?

27:00.035 --> 27:02.078
{\an8}- I DID FEEL
A LITTLE BAD ABOUT IT--

27:02.162 --> 27:03.955
{\an8}- AH, DON'T FEEL BAD.
IT'S ALL GOOD, BRO.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.332
{\an8}- BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
IT WAS A PRACTICAL JOKE...

27:05.415 --> 27:07.709
{\an8}- IT'S ALL GOOD, BRO.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.502
{\an8}- AND PEOPLE SAID YOU WERE
TALKING MAD [bleep] ABOUT ME

27:09.586 --> 27:12.213
{\an8}BEHIND MY BACK,
AND RATS--RATS EAT CHEESE.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.174
{\an8}- IT'S ALL GOOD, BRO.
- SO THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.467
{\an8}VINNY WAS DEFINITELY
VERY ANGRY

27:15.550 --> 27:17.260
{\an8}ABOUT THE WHOLE CHEESE
SITUATION

27:17.344 --> 27:18.470
{\an8}AND THAT HE WAS A RAT,

27:18.553 --> 27:20.555
{\an8}AND HE DIDN'T EVEN DO NOTHING.

27:20.638 --> 27:21.765
{\an8}I GUESS HE PROBABLY
KNEW IT WAS TRUE.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.225
{\an8}- SO VIN, THE ROOM WAS
SMELLING FOR A LITTLE BIT.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.227
{\an8}WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT?

27:26.311 --> 27:27.312
{\an8}- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.

27:27.395 --> 27:30.565
{\an8}AT THIS POINT,
PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK OF MIKE,

27:30.648 --> 27:32.108
{\an8}THE WAY HE ACTS,
THE WAY HE GOES AROUND

27:32.192 --> 27:35.945
{\an8}BRAGGING ABOUT [bleep] THAT
HE SHOULDN'T BE BRAGGING ABOUT.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.615
{\an8}YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF
THE [bleep] YOU DO

27:38.698 --> 27:39.282
{\an8}IS A LITTLE BIT ON THE LINE
OF EMBARRASSMENT,

27:39.366 --> 27:41.451
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

27:41.534 --> 27:43.870
{\an8}LIKE YOUR SWAGGER,
THE WAY YOU TALK TO GIRLS,

27:43.953 --> 27:45.080
{\an8}THIS AND THAT.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.081
{\an8}I CAN'T BRING GIRLS
TO THIS HOUSE, BRO.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.916
{\an8}THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
WHY, LIKE,

27:47.999 --> 27:50.251
{\an8}I GOT THIS TENSION
TOWARD YOU, BRO, BECAUSE...

27:50.335 --> 27:53.088
{\an8}- I REALLY DON'T GIVE
A [bleep] WHAT ANYBODY THINKS.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.923
{\an8}IF THEY DON'T LIKE ME,
THEY CAN GO [bleep] THEMSELVES.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.925
{\an8}- I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
WHY I BEEF WITH YOU.

27:57.008 --> 28:00.303
{\an8}AND I DO IT--I'M TALKING ABOUT
IT [bleep] TO YOUR FACE,

28:00.387 --> 28:02.305
{\an8}NOT [bleep] BEHIND YOUR BACK.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.640
{\an8}- THE SAME PERSON I MET
THE FIRST WEEK

28:03.723 --> 28:04.682
{\an8}WAS NOT THE SAME PERSON
I MET NOW.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.268
{\an8}- AGREED.
- YOU STARTED CHANGING, BRO.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.436
{\an8}YOU'RE A NICE GUY, BRO,

28:08.520 --> 28:09.396
{\an8}AND THEN [bleep] IN FRONT
OF EVERYBODY ELSE,

28:09.479 --> 28:10.563
{\an8}YOU'RE A DOUCHE BAG.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.024
{\an8}- IT JUST STARTED
FOR NO REASON,

28:13.108 --> 28:15.652
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU LOVE WHEN PEOPLE
TALK [bleep] ABOUT YOU.

28:15.735 --> 28:16.736
{\an8}YOU LOVE
WHEN PEOPLE HATE YOU,

28:16.820 --> 28:20.115
{\an8}AND YOU LOVE BEING LIKE
UP ON THAT PEDESTAL.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.909
{\an8}- I REALLY DON'T LIKE VINNY
TO BEGIN WITH AND...

28:22.992 --> 28:24.244
{\an8}YOU DON'T SEE ME
ATTACKING ANYBODY

28:24.327 --> 28:25.745
{\an8}LIKE, "OH, I DON'T LIKE
THE WAY YOU TALK

28:25.829 --> 28:27.288
{\an8}OR THE WAY YOU WALK."

28:27.372 --> 28:28.373
{\an8}I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
THE WAY YOU TALK.

28:28.456 --> 28:29.749
{\an8}- THAT'S NOT YOU, BRO.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.127
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
LIKE...BE YOU.

28:32.210 --> 28:32.961
{\an8}LIKE WE LIKE YOU
FOR YOU, BRO.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.296
{\an8}- LIKE RONNIE,
LIKE FOR REAL,

28:35.380 --> 28:37.966
{\an8}YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF,
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.592
{\an8}- BUT EVERYONE KNOWS
WHAT I'M TALKING--

28:39.676 --> 28:41.970
{\an8}- NEITHER DOES HE
KNOW ME NEITHER!

28:42.053 --> 28:45.473
{\an8}WE [bleep] KNOWN FOR
[bleep] 27 DAYS, ALL RIGHT?

28:45.557 --> 28:47.767
{\an8}NEITHER OF YOU GUYS
[bleep] KNOW ME!

28:47.851 --> 28:48.643
{\an8}- THE REAL COMES OUT, BRO.

28:48.726 --> 28:51.146
{\an8}- YEAH, THE REAL [bleep]
COMES OUT.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.605
{\an8}AND I BEEN THE SAME [bleep]

28:52.689 --> 28:54.816
{\an8}- YOU HAVEN'T.
YOU HAVEN'T.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.568
{\an8}- HAVE I GOT GIRLS EVERY DAY?
YEAH.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.319
{\an8}HAVE THEY NOT BEEN PRETTY?

28:58.403 --> 29:00.363
{\an8}SOME DAYS, NO.
SOME DAYS, YES.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.115
{\an8}- SITUATION, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
LIKE HOW HE ACTS,

29:02.198 --> 29:03.825
{\an8}WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,
THAT'S HIM.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.869
{\an8}HE'S BEEN LIKE THAT WITH ME
SINCE DAY ONE.

29:05.952 --> 29:07.787
{\an8}YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE HIM.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOUR BOY.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.205
{\an8}WHO'S ANYONE TO JUDGE
ANYWAY?

29:09.289 --> 29:11.666
{\an8}- YOU DON'T KNOW SOMEBODY
IN 2 DAYS OR 27 DAYS.

29:11.749 --> 29:13.835
{\an8}YOU'LL NEVER GET A GIRL
OVER ME, SON,

29:13.918 --> 29:15.170
{\an8}'CAUSE I GET 'EM FIRST.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.005
{\an8}&gt;&gt; I ALWAYS WILL GET
A GIRL OVER YOU.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.548

29:25.263 --> 29:27.140
{\an8}- ACTUALLY, I HOOKED UP
WITH SAM FIRST.

29:27.223 --> 29:28.975
{\an8}SO WHAT'S UP?
- I HAVE THE BEST THING.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.019
{\an8}THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STILL
CREEPIN' ON HER.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.188
