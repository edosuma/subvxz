05:35.919 --> 05:37.196
Hi.

05:37.220 --> 05:39.955
Hi.

06:00.810 --> 06:02.021
Thanks.

06:02.045 --> 06:03.823
Can I get you
something to drink?

06:03.847 --> 06:06.826
Yeah, I'll take a pitcher of
Budweiser, with two glasses.

06:06.850 --> 06:07.894
I have a friend coming.

06:07.918 --> 06:09.195
- Okay.
- Thanks.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.779
Thanks.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.181
Do you know
what you want to order yet?

06:28.205 --> 06:31.784
Yeah. I'm gonna go
with the chicken wings.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.319
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

06:33.343 --> 06:35.188
Excuse me, miss.

06:35.212 --> 06:36.222
Yes?

06:36.246 --> 06:37.757
This may be a coincidence,

06:37.781 --> 06:39.792
but you remind me
of someone I used to know.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.794
Really? What a coincidence.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.364
You wouldn't mind
telling me who you are?

06:44.388 --> 06:45.898
Oh. My name's Gloria.

06:45.922 --> 06:47.233
Hi, Gloria. I'm Bill.

06:47.257 --> 06:50.003
- Are you an actress?
- Yeah.

06:50.027 --> 06:51.304
I knew it.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.772
There's a movie-star beauty
about you.

06:52.796 --> 06:53.873
Thanks.

06:53.897 --> 06:55.041
So, you're an actress.

06:55.065 --> 06:56.142
How come I've never heard
of you?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.111
Ah. Well, I'm still one

06:58.135 --> 07:00.647
of those struggling actresses.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.181
I haven't made
my big movie break yet.

07:02.205 --> 07:04.150
But I do a lot
of low-budget indie films,

07:04.174 --> 07:06.174
in hopes that that'll get me
discovered.

07:09.412 --> 07:11.958
With a look like yours,
I'm sure one of these days,

07:11.982 --> 07:13.893
you'll be discovered
and make it big.

07:13.917 --> 07:16.329
Thanks for the encouragement.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.031
What movies have you been in?

07:18.055 --> 07:20.266
Nothing
that you would have heard of.

07:21.758 --> 07:24.303
Um, I've done
a bunch of indie films

07:24.327 --> 07:25.738
where I'm the featured role,

07:25.762 --> 07:27.173
and then I've done
some extra work

07:27.197 --> 07:28.875
on the big
Hollywood-budget films.

07:28.899 --> 07:31.177
Good. Background's good.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.413
- I'm a movie director.
- Great!

07:33.437 --> 07:35.915
And I'm directing this movie
called "Sunset Dreams."

07:35.939 --> 07:37.684
I really think
you should audition

07:37.708 --> 07:38.818
for the lead role of Kim.

07:38.842 --> 07:41.154
Okay, I'll consider it.

07:41.178 --> 07:43.756
Look...
let me give you my card.

07:43.780 --> 07:45.958
Give me a call, and I'll get
the casting director

07:45.982 --> 07:47.260
to set you up with an audition.

07:47.284 --> 07:49.262
Okay.

07:49.286 --> 07:50.418
Great.

08:00.864 --> 08:02.241
Hey, rod, over here!

08:02.265 --> 08:05.378
Hey, it's Bill.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.713
Hey, man.
It's so good to see you again.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.481
Yeah, it's been awhile, huh?

08:08.505 --> 08:10.983
- About five years or so?
- Yeah.

08:11.007 --> 08:12.351
Oh, um, this is my girlfriend,
Nathalie.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.853
Hi, Nathalie.
Nice to meet you.

08:13.877 --> 08:16.322
- Yes.
- Have a seat.

08:16.346 --> 08:19.459
Sure. You know,
the last time I saw you

08:19.483 --> 08:21.894
was at your Sundance premier,
your movie "Four Seasons,"

08:21.918 --> 08:23.796
which, by the way,
swept Sundance.

08:23.820 --> 08:24.964
Oh, we had so much fun.

08:24.988 --> 08:26.332
Oh, man, I was so drunk.

08:26.356 --> 08:28.735
And I was wasted
at the after-party.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.970
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

08:30.994 --> 08:32.438
You know what, though?

08:32.462 --> 08:34.474
I'm still amazed that
"Four Seasons" did so well

08:34.498 --> 08:36.442
and won all those awards
at Sundance.

08:36.466 --> 08:37.909
It was awesome.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.412
And then after that,

08:39.436 --> 08:41.313
you did that Hollywood film,
"in the sand," right?

08:41.337 --> 08:42.914
- I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

08:42.938 --> 08:44.784
It bombed

08:44.808 --> 08:48.888
'cause I didn't have creative
control, you know, final cut.

08:48.912 --> 08:53.159
Look... some of Hollywood's
greatest films are indies...

08:53.183 --> 08:56.362
"Vertigo," "Citizen Kane,"
and "psycho,"

08:56.386 --> 08:58.831
'cause they were
produced independently.

08:58.855 --> 09:02.135
And the director had complete
creative control and final cut.

09:02.159 --> 09:03.503
Hmm. Interesting.

09:03.527 --> 09:06.773
It's been all downhill
since "in the sand."

09:06.797 --> 09:08.141
How come?

09:08.165 --> 09:10.143
'Cause of that disaster,
the studios labeled me

09:10.167 --> 09:12.979
as an unviable commercial
Hollywood director...

09:13.003 --> 09:14.514
too auteur.

09:14.538 --> 09:15.882
Don't worry about it.
Just keep at it, man.

09:15.906 --> 09:17.183
Trust me.

09:17.207 --> 09:18.951
Something good
will come your way.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.854
I hope so.

09:21.878 --> 09:24.123
I heard you did quite well
in silicon valley.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.491
Yeah, I made a lot of money

09:25.515 --> 09:27.560
off these two high-tech
start companies...

09:27.584 --> 09:29.295
N.C.T. Software and Mad Solar.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.497
Good for you.
Let's toast to that.

09:31.521 --> 09:33.099
Yes. To success.

09:33.123 --> 09:34.189
To success.

09:36.926 --> 09:38.271
Did you get a chance
to read my script?

09:38.295 --> 09:40.106
Yeah, I did.

09:40.130 --> 09:42.041
So, what did you think?

09:42.065 --> 09:44.343
You know, maybe "Sunset Dreams"
will be your comeback movie.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.112
I'm betting on it.

09:46.136 --> 09:48.581
You know, I don't know too much
about the movie business,

09:48.605 --> 09:50.316
but I know how to read,
and I like your story.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.918
I'm glad you like it.

09:51.942 --> 09:54.253
You know, my favorite movies
about Hollywood

09:54.277 --> 09:56.589
are "sunset boulevard"
and "a star is born,"

09:56.613 --> 09:59.225
but these are two movies made
from the studios.

09:59.249 --> 10:01.527
There's never been a movie made
from the indie perspective...

10:01.551 --> 10:04.263
you know, the struggle
to make it as an actor,

10:04.287 --> 10:06.833
director, producer, and so on,

10:06.857 --> 10:08.968
to get that elusive
Hollywood-movie break.

10:08.992 --> 10:11.537
And that's why "Sunset Dreams"
is such a unique story.

10:11.561 --> 10:16.175
So, uh, how much money
do you need?

10:16.199 --> 10:18.110
$1 million.

10:18.134 --> 10:21.147
Wow. That much?

10:21.171 --> 10:23.983
Well, $1 million is really
considered an ultra-low budget

10:24.007 --> 10:25.384
by Hollywood standards.

10:25.408 --> 10:29.322
Most Hollywood movies
cost around $100 million.

10:29.346 --> 10:32.458
Hmm. You know what?

10:32.482 --> 10:35.228
I want to finance your movie,
but with one condition.

10:35.252 --> 10:36.529
What? Anything!

10:36.553 --> 10:38.464
You have to put my girlfriend,
Nathalie,

10:38.488 --> 10:39.899
and my adopted son, Tony,
in the film.

10:39.923 --> 10:41.200
Sure. You got it.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.336
Thanks.
I'm trying to get into acting,

10:43.360 --> 10:45.338
but my background has been
in modeling.

10:45.362 --> 10:47.006
You are beautiful.

10:47.030 --> 10:49.041
You definitely have a supporting
role in "Sunset Dreams."

10:49.065 --> 10:50.543
As a matter of fact,

10:50.567 --> 10:53.012
I think you should audition
for the lead role of Kim.

10:53.036 --> 10:54.580
I'd love to.

10:54.604 --> 10:56.115
- That's a great idea.
- Awesome.

10:56.139 --> 10:57.550
I'll set you up
with the audition.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.353
Thanks.

11:00.377 --> 11:01.888
You know what?

11:01.912 --> 11:03.623
I'm gonna write you a check
for $100,000

11:03.647 --> 11:05.513
to option for the script.

11:07.449 --> 11:10.363
You will get the remaining
balance of $900,000

11:10.387 --> 11:11.397
after we meet
the winning investors.

11:13.023 --> 11:16.591
Thanks a lot, man...
Mr. Executive producer.

11:21.664 --> 11:22.675
Ahh.

11:33.175 --> 11:35.655
Yesterday it rained dead birds.

11:35.679 --> 11:38.658
<i>5,000 birds fell from the sky
and were found dead</i>

11:38.682 --> 11:41.661
<i>in Beebe, Arkansas,
and Kentucky.</i>

11:41.685 --> 11:43.596
<i>A pastor has said
it is an omen,</i>

11:43.620 --> 11:45.665
<i>a religious meaning
the end of days.</i>

11:45.689 --> 11:47.466
<i>Investigators are inquiring
all possible causes</i>

11:47.490 --> 11:52.672
<i>speculation that it could be
lightning, storms,</i>

11:52.696 --> 11:54.440
<i>and government testing.</i>

11:54.464 --> 11:56.509
<i>Also this morning, it rained</i>

11:56.533 --> 11:59.645
<i>in a small northern California
coastal town of Half Moon Bay.</i>

11:59.669 --> 12:01.981
<i>What is so unusual
about the rain</i>

12:02.005 --> 12:04.617
<i>is that the color of the rain
has turned red.</i>

12:04.641 --> 12:07.553
<i>Scientists are testing
and examining the rainwater</i>

12:07.577 --> 12:09.689
<i>to find out why the rain
has turned red.</i>

12:09.713 --> 12:12.191
<i>Authorities have advised
the public to stay inside</i>

12:12.215 --> 12:15.149
<i>while it is raining
and to have an umbrella handy.</i>

12:55.524 --> 12:58.137
- Gloria?
- Yeah?

12:58.161 --> 12:59.338
It's me... Bill.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.073
Oh. Hi.

13:01.097 --> 13:02.208
So, we meet again.

13:02.232 --> 13:03.542
Yeah.

13:03.566 --> 13:05.578
It looks like you're going
somewhere far.

13:05.602 --> 13:08.447
Yeah. I'm going home.

13:08.471 --> 13:10.082
Home?

13:10.106 --> 13:11.417
Yes.

13:11.441 --> 13:14.720
I'm so sick
of this whole acting gig.

13:14.744 --> 13:19.058
I'm so sick of the movie
business, Hollywood.

13:19.082 --> 13:23.729
I have been auditioning so much,
it's insane.

13:23.753 --> 13:26.565
I've lived here
for over five years,

13:26.589 --> 13:29.468
and I just haven't gotten
lucky yet.

13:29.492 --> 13:31.737
Oh, come on.
Don't give up that easy.

13:31.761 --> 13:33.806
You're so beautiful
and talented.

13:33.830 --> 13:36.709
I can see that.
Just stay a little while longer.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.145
It's gonna happen for you.
I know it.

13:39.169 --> 13:40.813
I mean, I would not be surprised

13:40.837 --> 13:42.815
if someday
there were a star for you

13:42.839 --> 13:46.085
on the Hollywood star
walk of fame.

13:46.109 --> 13:50.289
Listen, thank you
for your encouragement

13:50.313 --> 13:54.115
and your kind words,
but I'm done with Hollywood.

13:56.251 --> 13:58.497
Oh, and I've got to catch
that greyhound bus.

13:58.521 --> 14:01.200
But thank you.

14:01.224 --> 14:03.724
Good luck.
I got to go. Bye.

14:08.464 --> 14:11.710
Wait, Gloria!
Please don't go!

14:11.734 --> 14:14.413
Please stop.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.714
I'll make you a deal.

14:15.738 --> 14:17.183
What?

14:17.207 --> 14:18.551
If you audition
for the lead role of Kim

14:18.575 --> 14:21.087
in my movie "Sunset Dreams"
and don't get it,

14:21.111 --> 14:23.778
I will give you $1,000
to help you go home.

14:26.315 --> 14:28.427
I could use $1,000.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.830
Do we have a deal?

14:30.854 --> 14:33.888
Okay.

14:54.877 --> 14:57.723
Wait. Wait a minute.
Hold it.

14:57.747 --> 15:00.126
There's this hot chick Kim
in the script, right?

15:00.150 --> 15:02.862
So, where are
the topless chicks?

15:02.886 --> 15:04.897
Right?
Where are the sex scenes?

15:04.921 --> 15:06.665
I don't see anything in here.

15:06.689 --> 15:08.868
We have to have it in here.

15:08.892 --> 15:11.704
Absolutely.
And there's no fight scenes.

15:11.728 --> 15:14.240
There's no blood.
There's no guts.

15:14.264 --> 15:16.142
But, guys, listen...
"Sunset Dreams"...

15:16.166 --> 15:18.332
it's not all about the babes,
boobs, and blood.

15:32.215 --> 15:35.461
So, let's go back.

15:35.485 --> 15:40.166
And should we ask... can
I ask you a question about 349?

15:40.190 --> 15:42.201
Um...

15:42.225 --> 15:46.739
Bill, "Sunset Dreams"
has a good story.

15:46.763 --> 15:50.376
It's a unique story about the
struggle to make it in Hollywood

15:50.400 --> 15:54.480
as an actor, as a director,
as a producer.

15:54.504 --> 15:57.850
However,
it's a risky investment.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.953
And, uh I think
we'd be a little crazy

16:00.977 --> 16:02.721
to invest in the film.

16:02.745 --> 16:05.858
But you've paid your dues,
and I think "Sunset Dreams"

16:05.882 --> 16:08.861
could be your big comeback movie
in Hollywood.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.363
You know, with a few minor
script revisions,

16:11.387 --> 16:13.732
I think "Sunset Dreams"
is gonna be a big hit.

16:13.756 --> 16:18.904
So, we've decided to invest
$1 million in your movie!

16:18.928 --> 16:20.506
Awesome!

16:20.530 --> 16:21.707
- Yes!
- Yeah, buddy!

16:21.731 --> 16:23.242
$1 million!

16:23.266 --> 16:26.545
Thank you!
Thank you!

16:29.572 --> 16:32.651
Mr. Executive producer.

16:32.675 --> 16:36.377
Thanks, everyone.
We're making a movie!

17:06.974 --> 17:11.890
To love somebody means to want
to be with that person forever.

17:11.914 --> 17:14.615
- Forever?
- Forever.

17:16.484 --> 17:22.434
To love somebody is to want to
be with that person... Forever.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.790
Forever?

17:41.677 --> 17:43.656
Hi, Bill.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.557
Hey, guys.
What's up?

17:45.581 --> 17:48.527
Hey, Bill.

17:48.551 --> 17:49.962
Gloria's audition was good.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.431
She's a beautiful girl.
She can act.

17:52.455 --> 17:53.899
Now, can we work with her?

17:53.923 --> 17:55.668
Of course we can.

17:55.692 --> 17:56.902
I got a chance to sit down
and talk with Gloria

17:56.926 --> 17:58.559
and get to know her
a little bit.

18:00.495 --> 18:03.642
She has the right attitude to
make it in the movie business,

18:03.666 --> 18:06.812
and I really think she'd be
great as Kim in "Sunset Dreams."

18:06.836 --> 18:09.481
Yeah, but I thought Nathalie
auditioned well, too.

18:09.505 --> 18:13.485
Yeah, but, um, Gloria does have
more experience in acting,

18:13.509 --> 18:15.943
as you can see
from her audition.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.466
Hello?

18:27.490 --> 18:28.989
Hi. Gloria?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.748
Yes?

18:42.772 --> 18:44.650
It's Bill
from Sunset Boulevard Pictures.

18:44.674 --> 18:46.985
Oh, hi.

18:47.009 --> 18:49.355
- I have good news.
- Yes?

18:49.379 --> 18:50.989
We're offering you
the lead role of Kim.

18:51.013 --> 18:52.858
How wonderful!

18:52.882 --> 18:54.560
So, what do you say?

18:54.584 --> 18:57.396
Yes, I would love to play Kim
in "Sunset Dreams."

18:57.420 --> 18:59.832
Awesome.
I think you'll be great as Kim.

18:59.856 --> 19:04.570
I know I will.
I mean, I'm playing myself.

19:04.594 --> 19:07.473
This could be your breakthrough
role into Hollywood...

19:07.497 --> 19:09.842
you know, your elusive
Hollywood-movie break.

19:09.866 --> 19:13.479
Yes.

19:13.503 --> 19:14.980
So, how about lunch tomorrow
to celebrate

19:15.004 --> 19:16.014
your first major movie role?

19:16.038 --> 19:20.419
Um, is this a pickup?

19:20.443 --> 19:23.889
No, not at all.
It's strictly business.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.959
Okay. Where?

19:26.983 --> 19:29.528
How about Pho Citi,

19:29.552 --> 19:31.830
on the corner of sunset
and La Brea, around 1:00?

19:31.854 --> 19:34.032
- Okay, great.
- Sounds good. See you then.

19:34.056 --> 19:36.068
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:51.139 --> 19:53.018
So tell me a little more
about yourself.

19:53.042 --> 19:54.753
I'm from San Francisco.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.923
I've always wanted
to be an actress,

19:57.947 --> 20:01.560
and I actually started
when I was 6.

20:01.584 --> 20:03.595
- Wow. That young?
- Yes.

20:03.619 --> 20:07.633
My grandfather, Jack Marlowe...
he encouraged and supported me

20:07.657 --> 20:10.969
throughout my entire
movie career.

20:10.993 --> 20:12.204
Wait a second.

20:12.228 --> 20:14.072
The legendary actor
Jack Marlowe?

20:14.096 --> 20:15.641
Yeah.

20:15.665 --> 20:17.743
Recently, did he pass away?

20:17.767 --> 20:20.879
Yeah, but he was 92.
It was his time.

20:20.903 --> 20:22.948
I'm so sorry to hear that.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.851
I'm gonna miss him a lot.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.587
He, um... he used to always
call me his little angel.

20:28.611 --> 20:31.623
So, I guess I don't have to
pay you that $1,000

20:31.647 --> 20:33.725
to get on the greyhound bus,
do I?

20:33.749 --> 20:36.028
Yes, and I'm so glad
you don't have to.

20:36.052 --> 20:38.018
Cheers.

20:41.056 --> 20:42.835
You know,
early in my movie career,

20:42.859 --> 20:44.636
I made this movie called
"replica,"

20:44.660 --> 20:47.005
and I had cast the perfect
actress for it.

20:47.029 --> 20:49.942
She was talented and beautiful,
just like yourself.

20:49.966 --> 20:51.543
She even looked like you.

20:51.567 --> 20:52.878
But for budget reasons,

20:52.902 --> 20:55.180
"replica" was never
completely produced.

20:55.204 --> 20:57.049
It fell apart,
and it was never released.

20:57.073 --> 20:59.251
And I've never been able
to forgive myself for that,

20:59.275 --> 21:00.786
for not being able to help out

21:00.810 --> 21:02.654
that talented
and beautiful actress.

21:02.678 --> 21:07.092
But casting you... that
is my redemption for "replica."

21:07.116 --> 21:10.729
Wow. Thank you so much for
helping me with my movie career,

21:10.753 --> 21:12.130
and thank you so much

21:12.154 --> 21:14.867
for not letting me get
on that greyhound bus.

21:14.891 --> 21:16.702
No, I had to.

21:16.726 --> 21:19.271
After seeing thousands of head
shots and hundreds of auditions,

21:19.295 --> 21:22.007
then I saw you... talent,
beauty, and grace

21:22.031 --> 21:23.509
all mixed in to one.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.711
I'm gonna help make you
a movie star.

21:25.735 --> 21:29.281
What can I do to ever repay you

21:29.305 --> 21:30.649
for helping me out
in my movie career?

21:30.673 --> 21:33.285
Oh, a lot.

- Having fun?
- Yeah.

24:24.780 --> 24:25.991
You two are together now?

24:26.015 --> 24:27.225
Oh, no, we're just friends.

24:27.249 --> 24:28.727
I was just showing Gloria

24:28.751 --> 24:30.328
some of "Sunset Dreams'"
filming locations.

24:30.352 --> 24:32.197
Yeah. Right.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.067
We were thinking about going
to the La Brea Tar Pits museum.

24:35.091 --> 24:36.134
You guys want to come?

24:36.158 --> 24:38.058
- Sure.
- Sounds fun.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.014
I'll be right back.
I got to go to the bathroom.

24:49.038 --> 24:51.739
All right.

24:53.808 --> 24:55.275
Let's keep going for awhile.

26:06.481 --> 26:09.227
Somebody, help me!
Ow!

26:09.251 --> 26:12.186
Ow! Ow!
Somebody, help me!

26:14.522 --> 26:16.334
- Are you okay?
- It stung me.

26:16.358 --> 26:17.836
What stung you?

26:17.860 --> 26:19.371
Something stung me.

26:19.395 --> 26:20.572
What stung you?

26:20.596 --> 26:22.541
- A jellyfish.
- A jellyfish?

26:22.565 --> 26:24.476
Yes, a giant, jumbo jellyfish.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.478
Hurry. Somebody call
an ambulance.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.246
Call 911.
Don't worry, miss.

26:28.270 --> 26:29.414
We're gonna get help.

26:29.438 --> 26:31.049
Please, we need
an ambulance now.

26:31.073 --> 26:32.584
A woman has been stung
on the beach.

26:32.608 --> 26:34.352
What happened to her?

26:34.376 --> 26:36.454
I don't know... something about
a giant, jumbo jellyfish.

26:36.478 --> 26:38.590
Please,
we need an ambulance now.

26:38.614 --> 26:40.125
Where are you located?

26:40.149 --> 26:42.494
On the Santa Monica beach,
near the pier.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.062
They're on their way now.

26:44.086 --> 26:46.164
Okay. Thank you.
They're coming.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.465
Okay.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.229
Giant, jumbo jellyfish, huh?

27:01.202 --> 27:04.149
Hey, guys, what did I miss?

27:04.173 --> 27:07.118
A woman was attacked
by a giant, jumbo jellyfish.

27:07.142 --> 27:10.121
Really?

29:02.623 --> 29:04.135
It's big.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.171
So, what kind of birds
are these?

29:06.195 --> 29:07.706
Ancient birds.

29:07.730 --> 29:10.408
Really? That's cool.

29:10.432 --> 29:13.411
Uh, eagles and vultures.

29:13.435 --> 29:15.013
How old do you think they are?

29:15.037 --> 29:16.181
Real old.

29:16.205 --> 29:18.149
Real old.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.485
That's cool.

29:20.509 --> 29:24.122
I wish Susan could have been
here to see this bird skeleton,

29:24.146 --> 29:28.148
but she got a disease
from that fish that rod cooked.

29:34.555 --> 29:38.191
I can get up there.

29:50.171 --> 29:53.051
Hey, that's Dr. Jones.

29:53.075 --> 29:54.152
Who's Dr. Jones?

29:54.176 --> 29:55.653
Oh, someone I recently met.

29:55.677 --> 29:58.456
Oh.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.459
Hey, Dr. Jones!

30:01.483 --> 30:03.528
Hi.

30:03.552 --> 30:04.696
So, we meet again.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.798
Yeah, what a surprise.

30:06.822 --> 30:09.667
Um, these are my friends,
Bill, Gloria.

30:09.691 --> 30:11.369
You remember Nathalie and Tony.

30:11.393 --> 30:13.304
Oh, hi.
Nice seeing you all again.

30:13.328 --> 30:15.373
Hey, Dr. Jones, do you have
any birds I could play with?

30:16.432 --> 30:18.343
Well, the birds that I have

30:18.367 --> 30:22.447
are way too large and dangerous
for you to play with, okay?

30:22.471 --> 30:24.115
So, how about a small one?

30:24.139 --> 30:25.517
Well, I'll tell you what...

30:25.541 --> 30:27.185
I'll send you some lovebirds.

30:27.209 --> 30:29.621
Oh, sweet.
I can't wait to play with them.

30:29.645 --> 30:31.756
Dr. Jones,
what are you doing here?

30:31.780 --> 30:34.092
Actually, I'm gonna be speaking
at a conference

30:34.116 --> 30:35.193
about prehistoric birds.

30:35.217 --> 30:36.828
Prehistoric birds?

30:36.852 --> 30:41.066
Yeah. I mean, don't you know
that birds are the descendants

30:41.090 --> 30:42.667
of, uh, dinosaurs?

30:42.691 --> 30:45.603
As a matter of fact,
prehistoric eagles and vultures

30:45.627 --> 30:47.839
actually lived right here
in this area,

30:47.863 --> 30:49.507
which is now Hollywood.

30:49.531 --> 30:52.410
But, of course,
prehistoric eagles and vultures

30:52.434 --> 30:56.081
are much larger than the
present-day vultures or eagles,

30:56.105 --> 30:57.816
specifically the errant eagle,

30:57.840 --> 31:01.853
or the archaeological name
is Neogyps errans.

31:01.877 --> 31:05.723
It's actually the ancestor
of the modern-day golden eagle.

31:05.747 --> 31:07.525
And the merriam's teratorn

31:07.549 --> 31:12.430
is actually the ancestor
of the modern-day vulture.

31:12.454 --> 31:16.434
Now, like I told you guys
when we met in Half Moon Bay,

31:16.458 --> 31:19.571
these prehistoric eagles
and vultures

31:19.595 --> 31:21.706
actually attacked cavemen.

31:46.854 --> 31:53.138
As a matter of fact, many
prehistoric eagles and vultures

31:53.162 --> 31:55.273
actually died and fell
into the tar.

31:55.297 --> 31:59.544
And some actually flew in,
got stuck, and drowned and died.

31:59.568 --> 32:03.815
As a matter of fact, "La Brea"
means "the tar" in English.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.918
But what's really fascinating
about this tar is,

32:06.942 --> 32:10.455
not only does it totally
preserve the bird's skeleton,

32:10.479 --> 32:13.892
but it also preserves
the blood vessels and the DNA.

32:13.916 --> 32:15.927
- Whoa.
- Wow.

32:15.951 --> 32:18.296
Well, I've got to go.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.698
I'm speaking at the next session
of the conference.

32:20.722 --> 32:22.923
It was nice seeing you
all again.

32:26.227 --> 32:29.474
- Bye, Dr. Jones.
- Goodbye, Dr. Jones.

Wait.

34:02.624 --> 34:05.336
Didn't Natalie Wood die here
in some kind of an accident?

34:05.360 --> 34:06.504
Yeah, she did.

34:06.528 --> 34:08.406
You know, all the lead cast

34:08.429 --> 34:11.309
in "rebel without a cause"
died young...

34:11.333 --> 34:14.411
James Dean at 24
and Natalie Wood at 43.

34:14.436 --> 34:17.949
Even the supporting cast...
Sal Mineo died at 37.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.751
I guess, for some actors,

34:19.775 --> 34:21.418
dying young is the price you pay
for stardom.

34:21.443 --> 34:23.321
That's very interesting.

34:23.344 --> 34:27.058
Wow. I really hope that I don't
die young if I become a star.

34:27.081 --> 34:29.293
Me too.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.862
Gloria, um, I wanted
to congratulate you

34:31.887 --> 34:34.399
on getting the lead role
in "Sunset Dreams."

34:34.422 --> 34:38.036
Thanks. I heard that you got
a supporting role.

34:38.060 --> 34:39.804
Yeah. Yeah.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.706
It's my first acting gig,
so I'm really excited about it.

34:41.730 --> 34:43.875
I know that you'll do great.

34:43.899 --> 34:46.010
Thanks.

34:46.034 --> 34:48.946
If you have any acting advice,
I'd love to hear it.

34:48.969 --> 34:51.815
Of course.
I'd love to help.

35:29.578 --> 35:30.588
She's gonna stop by

Yeah, that's fine.
I love your mom.

Oh, my gosh.
Nathalie, hi.

35:36.118 --> 35:39.097
- This is a surprise?
- Yeah. How's it going?

35:39.121 --> 35:41.065
- You remember rod.
- Hi, rod. How are you?

35:41.089 --> 35:43.067
- Nice seeing again.
- Good to see you, too.

Hey, you guys
having a good time?

35:50.665 --> 35:52.009
- Yeah.
- So am I.

35:52.033 --> 35:53.644
I'm taking a little vacation.

35:53.668 --> 35:55.613
I love it here
on Catalina Island.

35:55.637 --> 35:58.416
Well, mom, you remember I said
I wanted to get into acting

35:58.440 --> 36:00.084
- instead of modeling, right?
- Yeah.

36:00.108 --> 36:01.953
Well, I just landed
a little role in a movie

36:01.977 --> 36:03.054
called "Sunset Dreams."

36:03.078 --> 36:05.790
Oh, that's awesome!

36:05.814 --> 36:06.924
Oh, my gosh.

36:06.948 --> 36:08.693
Bill here is the director.

36:08.717 --> 36:11.462
Oh, Bill, thank you
for taking care of Nathalie.

36:11.486 --> 36:13.998
And rod's
the executive producer.

36:14.022 --> 36:17.902
The executive producer?
That is fantastic.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.137
Oh, my gosh.

36:19.161 --> 36:20.905
Rod and Bill, do you think

36:20.929 --> 36:23.841
you could give me
a little role in the film,

36:23.865 --> 36:27.945
or how about a feature role
in the film?

36:27.969 --> 36:32.417
Well, if not, how about at least
a scene with Nathalie?

36:32.441 --> 36:34.685
We can work something out,
right?

36:34.709 --> 36:36.854
Yeah, definitely.

36:36.878 --> 36:38.890
Oh, that would be so much fun!

36:40.582 --> 36:43.561
So, Nathalie, when are you two
gonna get married?

36:43.585 --> 36:44.896
Seriously.

36:44.920 --> 36:48.132
You guys have been together
a long time.

36:48.156 --> 36:52.069
And I'd love to see you get
married and have children.

36:52.093 --> 36:55.740
Um, well, ask rod.

36:55.764 --> 36:57.041
Rod?

36:57.065 --> 36:59.710
Um, when the right time
comes along?

36:59.734 --> 37:01.646
When?

37:01.670 --> 37:04.549
Uh, in time?

37:04.573 --> 37:05.783
Well, you know what?

37:05.807 --> 37:07.185
I'm not getting any younger,

37:07.209 --> 37:09.954
and I would love to have
grandchildren

37:09.978 --> 37:12.657
before I'm too old
to play with them.

37:12.681 --> 37:14.592
Well, we'll think about it.

37:14.616 --> 37:17.795
Anyways, please stay
and have dinner with us.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.630
- I would love to.
- Yeah, mom, stay.

37:19.654 --> 37:20.898
That would be fun.
I'll get a chair for you.

37:20.922 --> 37:22.867
Yeah.
We'll get you a gin and tonic.

37:22.891 --> 37:24.869
Okay. That sounds great.

37:24.893 --> 37:27.905
- Good.
- Well...

37:27.929 --> 37:30.475

I sure do.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.443
Do you want to see more?

41:25.467 --> 41:27.033
Sure.

44:14.935 --> 44:17.403
"Sunset Dreams,"
scene 27, take 3.

44:21.241 --> 44:22.586
Stand by.

44:22.610 --> 44:29.526
To love somebody is to want
to be with that person forever.

44:29.550 --> 44:31.128
Forever?

44:31.152 --> 44:33.931
And cut.

44:33.955 --> 44:36.022
That was good.

44:45.165 --> 44:46.243
Get a hanger!

45:21.635 --> 45:23.580
Yuck!

45:23.604 --> 45:25.082
Ugh.

45:25.106 --> 45:26.739
Die, birds.

45:50.530 --> 45:52.009
Nathalie, give me your gun.

45:52.033 --> 45:53.510
Seriously?
You're a terrible shot.

45:53.534 --> 45:55.279
Bill, take it.
It's okay.

45:55.303 --> 45:56.580
Hey, let's get the hell
out of here.

45:56.604 --> 45:58.649
Let's go.

46:11.218 --> 46:13.297
- I'm sure.
- I want to.

46:13.321 --> 46:14.999
It's supposed to be so fun.

46:15.023 --> 46:16.433
I heard Jeff's
gonna be there.

46:16.457 --> 46:18.002
- Ooh!
- He totally likes you.

46:18.026 --> 46:20.204
- You have a crush on him.
- I do.

46:20.228 --> 46:21.705
What are you gonna wear?

46:21.729 --> 46:25.342
I was thinking about
borrowing something from you.

46:25.366 --> 46:27.144
Oh, man.
Well, you know what?

46:27.168 --> 46:29.046
I'm gonna murder you!

46:46.788 --> 46:49.133
Oh, my god.
What is that?

47:03.737 --> 47:06.283
Unh! Unh!

47:16.283 --> 47:18.384
Oh, shit.

47:22.522 --> 47:24.623
She's dead.

47:29.362 --> 47:31.797
She's dead.
They're all dead.

47:38.171 --> 47:40.439
She's dead.

47:44.377 --> 47:46.090
- They're all dead.
- She's dead.

47:46.114 --> 47:47.591
Dead.

47:47.615 --> 47:49.626
All right.
Let's get out of here.

47:49.650 --> 47:51.350
Come on. Let's go.

48:06.366 --> 48:09.780
Help! Help us! Over here!

48:09.804 --> 48:11.470
Help me! Help!

49:15.602 --> 49:17.303
Are you okay?

49:31.751 --> 49:33.652
Ah! Get off of me!

49:36.623 --> 49:40.492
Aah!

50:14.995 --> 50:17.541
Help! Help me!
I'm over here!

50:17.565 --> 50:18.775
- Help!
- Look!

50:18.799 --> 50:20.978
Help! Help me!

50:21.002 --> 50:23.402
Help!

50:24.671 --> 50:27.017
Help! Aah!

50:40.920 --> 50:42.766
Hey, look, they stopped.

50:42.790 --> 50:44.301
- Oh, thank god.
- Oh, god.

50:44.325 --> 50:45.502
Yeah.

50:47.428 --> 50:48.894
She's dead.

50:51.398 --> 50:54.745
She's dead.

50:54.769 --> 50:56.346
Another one?

50:56.370 --> 50:58.971
We should have helped her.

51:31.805 --> 51:34.484
Look. The birds are flying away.

51:37.511 --> 51:39.656
Quick... see if anyone's
still left alive.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.926
I already checked.
Everyone is dead.

51:42.950 --> 51:45.562
Yeah, I did, too.
There's no one left.

51:45.586 --> 51:48.398
It's armageddon,
the end of days.

51:48.422 --> 51:50.534
You know,
I saw on the news last week

51:50.558 --> 51:52.336
that thousands of birds had died

51:52.360 --> 51:54.504
and fallen out of the sky
in Arkansas.

51:54.528 --> 51:56.073
I wonder if this has something
to do with that.

51:56.097 --> 51:59.409
Birds falling out of the sky?

51:59.433 --> 52:00.944
Yeah. And even more birds

52:00.968 --> 52:03.714
had died in a small northern
coastal California town

52:03.738 --> 52:04.748
called Half Moon Bay.

52:04.772 --> 52:06.483
Half Moon Bay?

52:06.507 --> 52:07.884
And what's even stranger

52:07.908 --> 52:10.454
is the rain in Half Moon Bay
had turned red.

52:10.478 --> 52:13.056
Strange and weird things

52:13.080 --> 52:15.092
are happening in the environment
right now.

52:15.116 --> 52:17.794
Guys, can we just change
the subject?

52:17.818 --> 52:20.931
"Jaws" happens to be one
of my favorite movies.

52:20.955 --> 52:23.567
Are you really worried
about the movies right now?

52:23.591 --> 52:24.935
Yeah, seriously.

52:24.959 --> 52:26.803
Why not? I mean, the birds
are attacking us.

52:26.827 --> 52:28.638
I feel like I'm in a movie.

52:28.662 --> 52:31.675
In fact, my next script will be
about birds attacking Hollywood.

52:31.699 --> 52:35.645
Great idea.
Hey, will you cast me in it?

52:35.669 --> 52:37.381
Yeah. Me too.

52:37.405 --> 52:38.849
I can direct it.

52:38.873 --> 52:42.719
Sure, if you can find a producer
to option my script.

52:42.743 --> 52:44.921
My best friend, rod, here...

52:44.945 --> 52:47.124
he's the executive producer
of "Sunset Dreams."

52:47.148 --> 52:49.159
I'm sure he'd love to take
a look at your script.

52:49.183 --> 52:50.727
Yeah, that's a great idea

52:50.751 --> 52:52.763
of turning this birds attack
into a movie.

52:52.787 --> 52:54.097
You know what?

52:54.121 --> 52:55.832
It could be just as big
as the "jaws" franchise.

52:55.856 --> 52:57.634
Yeah.

52:57.658 --> 53:01.538
Or maybe as big as "saw" or
"paranormal activity" franchise.

53:01.562 --> 53:04.141
Guys, we need to slow down
and stop daydreaming

53:04.165 --> 53:05.942
and to get the hell out of here

53:05.966 --> 53:08.745
before these birds attack us on
this Hollywood studios back lot.

53:08.769 --> 53:11.515
- Which way should we go?
- Let's go that way.

53:11.539 --> 53:12.783
- Let's go.
- Okay.

53:35.562 --> 53:37.140
God, it stinks.

53:37.164 --> 53:39.198
It smells like something's dead.

53:48.174 --> 53:49.541
Is he dead?

53:51.678 --> 53:53.023
Is he breathing?

53:53.047 --> 53:54.191
He's dead.

53:54.215 --> 53:56.181
Damn.

53:58.585 --> 54:00.964
It's locked.

54:00.988 --> 54:02.165
Let's get out of here.

54:02.189 --> 54:04.167
Let's go.

54:04.191 --> 54:07.971
Help! Get me out of here!

54:07.995 --> 54:10.907
Help! Get me out of here!

54:10.931 --> 54:13.176
Hey, guys,
somebody's in the cabin.

54:13.200 --> 54:14.244
- Huh?
- Huh?

54:14.268 --> 54:18.237
Hey, wait. Hi.

54:20.773 --> 54:21.818
Hi. Are you all right?

54:21.842 --> 54:23.653
Yes.

54:23.677 --> 54:27.257
The birds attacked the set
and killed everybody.

54:27.281 --> 54:28.892
Oh, my god.

54:28.916 --> 54:32.496
And I survived
just by hiding in this cabin.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.830
What is your name?

54:33.854 --> 54:35.198
Jessica.

54:35.222 --> 54:38.635
I'm will,
and I'm a screenwriter.

54:38.659 --> 54:41.605
Why are the birds attacking?

54:41.629 --> 54:43.139
I wish I knew the answer
to that.

54:43.163 --> 54:45.575
Maybe it's global warming.

54:45.599 --> 54:47.844
- Global warming?
- Yeah.

54:47.868 --> 54:50.080
A few years ago,
rod and I were attacked

54:50.104 --> 54:52.215
in a small town
called Half Moon Bay.

54:52.239 --> 54:55.151
The resident bird expert
there...

54:55.175 --> 54:57.821
he said that it might be
global warming.

54:57.845 --> 55:00.690
It has to be global warming.

55:00.714 --> 55:01.791
Yeah.

55:01.815 --> 55:02.993
Why don't you join us?

55:03.017 --> 55:04.694
We're all trying
to get out of here.

55:04.718 --> 55:07.531
Yes.

55:07.555 --> 55:09.199
Come on, guys.
Let's go this way.

55:09.223 --> 55:11.134
All right.

55:46.759 --> 55:48.638
Hey, I know you.
You're that tree hugger.

55:48.662 --> 55:49.806
Yes.

55:49.830 --> 55:51.708
- We met in the forest.
- Yes.

55:51.732 --> 55:53.710
But I thought you loved
the trees so much

55:53.734 --> 55:55.078
and you protected them

55:55.102 --> 55:57.147
and that you would never leave
the forest.

55:57.171 --> 55:59.115
Yeah,
but after we spoke that day,

55:59.139 --> 56:02.619
there was a forest fire that
burned and destroyed everything.

56:02.643 --> 56:04.688
Look at the decimation
of global warming,

56:04.712 --> 56:07.657
what it's done to the forests
and the trees.

56:07.681 --> 56:08.792
They're all dead.

56:08.816 --> 56:10.660
And that fire almost killed me.

56:10.684 --> 56:12.862
I barely escaped.

56:12.886 --> 56:14.864
But Annie saved me.

56:14.888 --> 56:18.902
You see, rod, I didn't want
to leave the forest.

56:18.926 --> 56:21.137
But then I stayed too long,

56:21.161 --> 56:25.709
and the smoke from the fire
made me sick, coughing.

56:25.733 --> 56:27.065
I passed out.

56:45.351 --> 56:51.034
Hey, mister, wake up.
We've got to get out of here.

56:51.058 --> 56:53.058
We've got to get out of here.

57:07.140 --> 57:10.787
And that's how I met Annie,
and now she's my lovely wife.

57:10.811 --> 57:12.255
And we have a baby girl.

57:12.279 --> 57:13.690
Congratulations.

57:13.714 --> 57:15.025
Thanks.

57:15.049 --> 57:16.393
But aren't you two known

57:16.417 --> 57:18.261
as "The No-Emitting Family"
to the public?

57:18.285 --> 57:21.965
Yes. We have a TV reality show
called "The No-Emitting Family."

57:21.989 --> 57:25.969
Yes. I saw you guys on TV
the other day.

57:25.993 --> 57:29.139
My dad is a Hollywood
TV producer, so he suggested

57:29.163 --> 57:33.109
that we start a TV reality show
called "The No-Emitting Family"

57:33.133 --> 57:36.346
because my husband, Tom,
here is so pro-environmental.

57:36.370 --> 57:39.816
The show documents everything
that we do that's green.

57:39.840 --> 57:44.821
That means no co2 admitting,
all non-polluting activities,

57:44.845 --> 57:48.792
and we do solar,
we grow our own vegetables,

57:48.816 --> 57:50.226
and we only buy goods

57:50.250 --> 57:53.163
that are from sources
that are non-polluting.

57:53.187 --> 57:56.366
And actually we're really big
fans of the iPad and e-books

57:56.390 --> 57:59.135
because they're just cutting
down too many trees

57:59.159 --> 58:00.470
to make books, you know?

58:00.494 --> 58:02.038
I think I saw an episode

58:02.062 --> 58:04.140
that said you guys don't use
toilet paper.

58:04.164 --> 58:07.077
That's right.
Toilet paper is made from trees.

58:07.101 --> 58:09.746
Trees are cut down
to make toilet paper.

58:09.770 --> 58:12.382
In fact, we haven't used
toilet paper in many years.

58:12.406 --> 58:14.150
Are you two aware

58:14.174 --> 58:16.052
that the eagles and vultures
are attacking?

58:16.076 --> 58:18.321
Yes, but they don't seem
to bother us,

58:18.345 --> 58:23.326
probably because we live
a green, non-emitting lifestyle.

58:23.350 --> 58:25.995
Well, it was nice seeing you
guys again, and your family.

58:26.019 --> 58:28.153
- Guys, let's go.
- Let's get out of here.

59:34.353 --> 59:38.334
Hey, rod, there are people
in that car.

59:38.358 --> 59:40.470
Let's stop and see
if anyone's still alive.

59:40.494 --> 59:42.427
Yeah, good idea.

01:00:21.968 --> 01:00:23.079
They're dead.

01:00:23.103 --> 01:00:25.548
Grab their gun.

01:00:25.572 --> 01:00:27.550
Dustin.

01:00:27.574 --> 01:00:30.153
Hell, yeah.

01:00:30.177 --> 01:00:32.355
Let's get out of here.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:33.879
Let's go.

01:01:03.543 --> 01:01:06.489
Hey, look, there's someone
laying on the ground

01:01:06.513 --> 01:01:08.291
in front of the movie theater.

01:01:08.315 --> 01:01:09.614
Let's go check it out.

01:01:26.632 --> 01:01:30.146
He's dead.

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:32.938
Let's go inside.

01:01:34.206 --> 01:01:35.685
- You go that way.
- All right.

01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:38.521
- Dustin.
- Yep.

01:01:38.545 --> 01:01:41.513
That way.

01:01:52.224 --> 01:01:54.971
My god, the birds are attacking
everyone in the theater.

01:01:54.995 --> 01:01:56.239
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:01:56.263 --> 01:01:57.595
- Shit!
- Aah!

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:02.367
Go!

01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:08.318
Go! Go!

01:02:20.619 --> 01:02:24.033
Hey, rod, I know this shortcut
through the cemetery.

01:02:24.057 --> 01:02:27.993
Yeah, that's a great idea.
Let's do it.

01:03:33.092 --> 01:03:35.405
Hey, look.
There's some people over there.

01:03:35.429 --> 01:03:37.106
We should stop and help them.

01:03:51.177 --> 01:03:54.057
- Hello? Need any help?
- Hey!

01:03:54.081 --> 01:03:56.059
Over here!

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.296
Whoa, guys.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.731
There's something wrong
with them.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.466
They're zombies.

01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:05.601
- What?!
- Stop. Don't move.

01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:07.392
Don't come any closer.

01:04:14.834 --> 01:04:17.447
Aaaah!

01:04:17.471 --> 01:04:19.482
Aah!

01:04:19.506 --> 01:04:21.484
Want some?!

01:04:21.508 --> 01:04:24.476
Get some!

01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:36.821
There's one.

01:04:40.526 --> 01:04:42.560
- Yep.
- Get her.

01:04:50.836 --> 01:04:53.116
Unh! Aah!

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:05.394
She's dead. Let's go.

01:05:05.418 --> 01:05:07.363
Yeah, come on!
Go! Go! Go!

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.794
Aah!

01:05:21.867 --> 01:05:24.881
Next time, we're not
taking any more shortcuts.

01:05:24.905 --> 01:05:28.184
Fair enough.

01:05:31.278 --> 01:05:33.756
We should have brought
Jessica with us.

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.225
No, she's dead.
She was bitten by that zombie.

01:05:36.249 --> 01:05:37.560
If we would have brought her,

01:05:37.584 --> 01:05:39.395
she would have infected
all of us.

01:05:39.419 --> 01:05:40.585
Yeah, will, he's right.

01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:06.489
Hey, we should go in that zoo.
There might be people in there.

01:06:06.513 --> 01:06:08.324
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:06:08.348 --> 01:06:09.892
The last time we took a detour
was through that cemetery,

01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:11.694
and do you remember
what happened?

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:13.462
We were attacked
by those zombies.

01:06:13.486 --> 01:06:15.198
I'm not going
through that again.

01:06:15.222 --> 01:06:16.699
Look, it's just a zoo.

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:18.901
There might be people in there
that need our help.

01:06:18.925 --> 01:06:20.403
Yes.

01:06:20.427 --> 01:06:22.205
But what if the animals
try to attack us?

01:06:22.229 --> 01:06:25.208
We can defend ourself.
We have guns.

01:06:26.299 --> 01:06:28.811
Okay. But if something happens,

01:06:28.835 --> 01:06:30.646
I'm gonna be doing the driving.

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:32.949
Fine.

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:03.980
Hey, mister.

01:07:04.004 --> 01:07:06.616
We didn't mean to alarm you.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.883
It is okay.

01:07:07.907 --> 01:07:09.652
Can I help you with something?

01:07:09.676 --> 01:07:11.887
Yeah. Are you aware that
the birds are attacking people?

01:07:11.911 --> 01:07:14.857
Yes,
but they do not attack us.

01:07:14.881 --> 01:07:16.626
They are my friends.

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:18.294
Friends?

01:07:18.318 --> 01:07:20.663
Yes, because I understand
why they are attacking.

01:07:20.687 --> 01:07:21.897
Why?

01:07:21.921 --> 01:07:24.500
Because all the animals
in the zoo

01:07:24.524 --> 01:07:26.569
are getting sick from disease.

01:07:26.593 --> 01:07:30.273
I think global warming might
have something to do with it...

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:32.875
all the animals,
all the birds getting sick.

01:07:32.899 --> 01:07:34.377
It is killing them.

01:07:34.401 --> 01:07:36.679
Is there any way to stop
the birds' attack?

01:07:36.703 --> 01:07:38.381
No, there are too many of them.

01:07:38.405 --> 01:07:41.617
But if we all try to live
a greener lifestyle...

01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:43.719
a greener lifestyle?

01:07:43.743 --> 01:07:46.956
Yes. This zoo is powered
by solar energy.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.792
All the zoo vehicles
are electric-powered.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:52.762
The birds' attack
was just an omen.

01:07:52.786 --> 01:07:55.364
The seas of the earth are rising

01:07:55.388 --> 01:07:58.934
because the ice in the arctic is
melting at an accelerated rate.

01:07:58.958 --> 01:08:01.804
It only takes a 2-degree rise
in the earth's temperature

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:04.807
for all of civilization
to be underwater.

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:07.843
If we do not stop polluting
the earth now,

01:08:07.867 --> 01:08:11.847
this zoo and all the cities
at sea level will be underwater.

01:08:11.871 --> 01:08:14.517
Interesting.

01:08:14.541 --> 01:08:15.918
Yeah.

01:08:15.942 --> 01:08:17.486
Well, it was nice meeting you.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.877
Guys, let's hit the road.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:44.969
No! Wait!

01:08:59.984 --> 01:09:03.432
From now on, Bill,
I'm doing the driving.

01:09:03.456 --> 01:09:04.800
You know what, rod?

01:09:04.823 --> 01:09:07.569
It wasn't the animals
that killed Dustin.

01:09:07.594 --> 01:09:08.960
It was those damn birds.

01:09:16.502 --> 01:09:18.613
Hey, rod, look.
There's some people right there.

01:09:18.638 --> 01:09:20.483
We should stop and see
if they need any help.

01:09:20.506 --> 01:09:21.506
Okay.

01:09:47.131 --> 01:09:49.100
Are you okay?

01:10:07.085 --> 01:10:08.920
Oh, my god, they're fighting.

01:10:10.722 --> 01:10:12.757
We... we should help them.

01:10:18.765 --> 01:10:19.897
Help!

01:10:22.568 --> 01:10:24.113
Come on, rod! Come on!

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:26.882
Will, wake up!

01:10:26.906 --> 01:10:28.050
Will!

01:10:28.074 --> 01:10:30.152
Yeah, you're okay.

01:10:30.176 --> 01:10:31.454
- Come on!
- Will, get up!

01:10:31.478 --> 01:10:33.689
Come on!

01:11:33.806 --> 01:11:35.918
Damn. We're out of gas.

01:11:35.942 --> 01:11:38.988
Well, look.
There's a hotel up there.

01:11:39.012 --> 01:11:40.556
Maybe they have some gas.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.812
Maybe.

01:13:01.194 --> 01:13:03.728
The birds are coming!

01:13:54.913 --> 01:13:56.747
Will!
