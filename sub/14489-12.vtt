Can we please get
new uniforms now, Professor?

00:35.078 --> 00:37.121
You said you would replace
them a year ago.

01:09.487 --> 01:11.656
Such a stereotype.

01:11.990 --> 01:15.159
Yes, I'm looking for
something in a space uniform

01:15.243 --> 01:17.620

humiliating

You got it. Tomorrow's olothes
at yesterday's prioes.

01:25.962 --> 01:28.631
Ah. You can't go wrong
with a still suit.

01:29.007 --> 01:32.427
It recycles your solid waste
into a nice piece gefilte fish.

01:32.510 --> 01:33.553
Ugh.

01:33.636 --> 01:36.097

02:11.049 --> 02:13.635

Year-Ago Professor would do.

02:27.857 --> 02:28.900
We'll take them.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.661
Finally, a uniform I'd be
happy to be caught dead in.

And, boy, does it wick away moisture,
gallons and gallons of it.

Plus, they're
stitched in such a way

02:45.708 --> 02:47.794

it's viewed from,

02:47.877 --> 02:50.088

actually buy that getup?

stoop to buy getups.

even know about foxhunting?

03:09.774 --> 03:12.193
Foxhunting is an ancient

ever since

03:13.986 --> 03:15.697

Don't be naive, Leela. We kill
defenseless animals all the time.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.584
Uh-oh, a fork in the path.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.714
There's more places to hide
in that dark forest.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.383
On the other hand, I could run
faster through that open meadow.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.844
But of course,
the forest might protect

13:21.969 --> 13:23.971
my fair robot
skin from sunburn.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.181
Hmm...

13:29.435 --> 13:30.894
(SOUNDS HORN)

13:33.772 --> 13:38.527
Today, we hunt the most dangerous
game, aside from lawn darts,

13:38.610 --> 13:42.698
a cunning robotic adversary
so deviously clever that...

13:43.240 --> 13:45.284
For God's sake.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.912
Then again, a nice run through a
meadow, who could say no to that?

13:48.996 --> 13:50.164
What?

13:52.458 --> 13:54.877
Look here.
Hunting is a team effort,

13:54.960 --> 13:56.712
and you're not
pulling your weight.

13:56.795 --> 14:00.549
Now, I'm going to be sporting and
give you one more ohanoe to run.

14:00.924 --> 14:04.678
Thanks. Nothing's more
important than sportsmanship.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.638
(LAUGHS)

14:09.767 --> 14:12.603
It's so cute.
Horseshoe crab cute.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.486
Fox news, everyone.

14:20.569 --> 14:24.323
I've decided to make the fox
our new corporate mascot.

14:24.615 --> 14:27.159
Hear, hear.
Let's put on our new uniforms

14:27.284 --> 14:29.870
and take a staff photo
for the newsletter.

14:30.079 --> 14:31.080
Right On!

14:31.789 --> 14:34.500
Here they are,
freshly laundered and...

14:35.000 --> 14:36.210
(GROWLING)

14:39.171 --> 14:42.841
Our magnificent uniforms.
They're ruined.

14:43.092 --> 14:44.343
(sesame)

14:44.802 --> 14:48.430
And he peed on the locker room floor.
That's my territory.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.933
Also got in
the henhouse and killed

14:51.058 --> 14:52.810
Amy's prize-winning
Rhode Island Red.

14:53.102 --> 14:54.770
Not Penelope.

14:55.145 --> 14:58.148
Cute or not,
I'll kill that robo-rat.

15:02.903 --> 15:06.532
Let rne at it. I'm gonna pound it
with this chewed-up old stick.

15:06.824 --> 15:09.993
No! It's just a poor,
scared wild robot.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.121
What did you expect?
(GASPS)

15:12.204 --> 15:14.164
My sign. It's ruined.

15:14.832 --> 15:15.916
Kill the fox.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.501
(GRUNTING)

15:32.516 --> 15:34.935
Missed it by that much.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.108
Oh, no, they caught my scent.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.360
I better throw them off by
rubbing myself with something.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.904
(CRUNCHING NOISE)

15:47.030 --> 15:49.116
That's no good.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.286
Wait, I know what'll confuse
those dogs. Catnip.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.206
(CATS YOWLING)

16:04.590 --> 16:06.884
You have made yourself
an enemy, my friend!

16:15.225 --> 16:18.353
Dang it. He jumped on
the PATH train to New Jersey.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.773
Of course. He's commuting
back to his native habitat.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.160
On top of everything,
I'm starving.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.537
I'll have to carve a sandwich
out of this tree branch.

16:39.374 --> 16:40.375
Ow!

16:40.459 --> 16:44.505
My finger. I wish I remembered more
survival skills from Boy Scouts.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.591
Too bad my only merit badge
was in interpretive dance.

16:48.383 --> 16:52.137
Wait. I can use the universal
language of dance to signal for help.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.598
(VOCALIZING MELODY)

16:56.433 --> 16:57.434
Ow!

16:57.518 --> 17:00.145
That was my
second-favorite ankle.

17:01.897 --> 17:02.940
(HORN SOUNDING)

17:03.607 --> 17:05.776
Was that a horn?
Are those the dogs?

17:06.818 --> 17:09.445
Is that two caterpillars
making sweet love?

17:09.530 --> 17:10.531
(SHRIEKS)

17:10.948 --> 17:11.990
Aw...

17:12.074 --> 17:14.451
You know what it's like
to feel hunted, too, buddy?

17:14.785 --> 17:16.328
Would it be too
much to ask you

17:16.453 --> 17:18.038
to stay with me
in my final moments

17:18.121 --> 17:19.915
and die at my side?

17:19.998 --> 17:21.290
And you die first?

17:21.916 --> 17:23.001
(GROWLING)

17:23.544 --> 17:25.087
You lousy son of a...
(TRAP UNLATCHES)

17:25.921 --> 17:28.048
I get it. You freed me.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.260
You lousy son of a...

17:38.600 --> 17:40.352
We're hot on his heels.

17:40.435 --> 17:41.436
A-ha!

17:41.520 --> 17:42.896
One of his heels.

17:43.146 --> 17:44.481
<i>(PLANET EXPRESS APPROACHING)</i>

17:48.068 --> 17:50.112
Oh... These guys.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.572
Can I help you?

17:51.655 --> 17:54.074
Out of our way.
This fox is ours.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.244
Fox? Yes. Have at it.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.496
We're not hunting fox today.

17:59.955 --> 18:02.666
Wait a second.
What are you hunting?

18:03.667 --> 18:06.461
Oh, my God.
It's Bender's middle finger.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.463
I'd recognize this anywhere.

18:08.589 --> 18:09.590
(GASPS)

18:13.885 --> 18:14.886
(GROWLS)

18:16.346 --> 18:20.475
What is it, little buddy? Is it a layer
cake? Or maybe World Series tickets?

18:22.644 --> 18:26.607
A trip wire.
But who's tripping who?

18:28.775 --> 18:29.860
(LAUGHS)

18:32.529 --> 18:35.282
Wait, whom.
Who's tripping whom?

18:35.616 --> 18:36.867
(RESUMES LAUGHING)

18:39.286 --> 18:42.539
I guess what I've been trying to
say is we should all be ashamed.

18:42.956 --> 18:46.627
Me for my hatred of a mechanical
fox that tore up my sign

18:46.710 --> 18:48.295
and who I'd like to throttle,

18:48.545 --> 18:51.256
and you for hunting
an innocent robot.

18:51.882 --> 18:54.593
Well, a robot who didn't
harm you personally.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.928
Today. Probably.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.724
But most of all,
I blame you, hunt master.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.685
Where's the hunt master?

19:03.894 --> 19:05.812
Remember when you
said "nobody leave"

19:05.937 --> 19:07.814
and then you turned
your head briefly?

19:07.898 --> 19:09.399
He left an hour before that.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.451
(CHUCKLES)

19:27.751 --> 19:29.252
(STRUGGLING)

19:31.088 --> 19:32.422
(CHUCKLES)

19:32.506 --> 19:34.466
You disappoint me, Bender.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.093
I'd have thought
you'd have learned

19:36.176 --> 19:38.261
to avoid my antigravity
snares by now.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.139
I did. Too bad you didn't.

19:43.558 --> 19:44.559
Ye gods!

19:45.435 --> 19:46.853
(SCREAMS)

19:49.981 --> 19:51.942
How does it feel
to be the hunted?

19:52.275 --> 19:54.111
To be forever looking
over your shoulder,

19:54.444 --> 19:56.196
like an owl with
that type of neck?

19:56.738 --> 20:00.617
To die in agony at the hands
of the world's greatest lover?

20:01.535 --> 20:02.911
No! Please!

20:06.456 --> 20:07.958
I can't shoot you.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.086
Bender, I found
your trigger finger.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.462
Now I can.

20:13.964 --> 20:16.675
But I won't.
Not with so many witnesses.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.802
You're a true gentleman.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.095
Unlike me.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.596
(BOTH GASP)

20:28.812 --> 20:30.480
I can't watch...

20:30.564 --> 20:31.565
Enough.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.900
Oh, no!

20:36.111 --> 20:37.487
Hey, wait a minute.

20:40.866 --> 20:43.201
He was also a robot? Dude!

20:43.660 --> 20:45.996
So a robot fox
killed a robot human?

20:46.496 --> 20:48.331
I guess that makes it okay.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.834
No. Killing
of any kind is...

20:51.251 --> 20:52.919
I don't know, well...

20:53.420 --> 20:54.796
Let me think about this.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.471
(SIGHS CONTENTEDLY)

21:03.263 --> 21:04.931
I guess it's okay.
