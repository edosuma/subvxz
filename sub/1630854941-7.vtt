00:51.524 --> 00:55.487
My father was part of a special envoy
to France at the end of the war.

00:55.487 --> 00:58.949
Was quite influential with some of the
language in the Treaty of Versailles.

00:58.949 --> 01:00.367
You don't say?

01:00.866 --> 01:06.248
President Poincare gave him this bottle
from the personal collection of Napoleon.

01:08.791 --> 01:13.672
There's an inscription by him
on the inside of the label.

01:15.090 --> 01:17.467
See what it says?
A la victoire.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.885
- Yeah, I don't speak...
- To victory.

01:32.106 --> 01:33.191
It's good.

01:36.735 --> 01:39.280
- Where are you from, Peter?
- It's Pete.

01:40.198 --> 01:41.949
- San Bernardino.
- San Bernardino.

01:41.949 --> 01:44.410
- Were you on the force out there?
- For a few years.

01:44.869 --> 01:47.330
L.A. must've been a nice step up
from that place.

01:47.330 --> 01:49.791
More bang for your buck in this city.

01:51.126 --> 01:52.876
I'd say a lot more.

01:57.881 --> 01:59.634
- What's this?
- Your bonus.

02:00.844 --> 02:03.262
I don't need to know
the particulars of how you did it.

02:03.262 --> 02:06.807
But I just wish you could have seen
the look on Mason's face

02:06.807 --> 02:08.475
when I told the judge.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.648
Pretty sure I could picture it.

02:14.898 --> 02:16.400
Sincerely though.

02:17.985 --> 02:22.824
The loyalty that you've shown to me in
this office is gonna go a long way, Pete.

02:24.116 --> 02:25.410
Yeah.

02:29.706 --> 02:30.916
Another belt?

02:31.415 --> 02:34.920
Nah. Wasted on a guy like me.

02:55.522 --> 02:58.443
- Good morning.
- He's running a few minutes late.

03:01.195 --> 03:02.988
Did you really think
I wouldn't figure this one out?

03:02.988 --> 03:04.407
Oh my god.

03:06.450 --> 03:10.329
I would say it would be worth you
spending some time in law school,

03:10.329 --> 03:12.206
but after this meeting,
it might be a moot point.

03:12.206 --> 03:13.874
Fuck you, Milligan.

03:15.084 --> 03:18.462
Off to an auspicious start, I see,
Mr. Mason.

03:20.547 --> 03:23.468
- Anything I need to know about?
- Anything that I do?

03:23.468 --> 03:24.803
Sit, sit.

03:25.928 --> 03:28.431
I spent a good part
of the night looking further into this,

03:28.431 --> 03:32.435
and I could not find a single precedent
to base a decision in this matter on.

03:32.435 --> 03:34.187
Nor do I care to.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.400
What in God's name were you thinking?

03:38.732 --> 03:41.486
l was just doing what I thought
was best for my clients.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.654
That's an interesting way
of going about it.

03:43.654 --> 03:46.323
Judge, the citizens of this city
are on edge.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.742
They want justice, and they deserve it.

03:48.742 --> 03:50.953
And part of that justice is making sure

03:50.953 --> 03:53.748
that it's known that Mr. Mason needed
to conceal evidence

03:53.748 --> 03:56.041
in order to hide the fact that his clients
murdered McCutcheon.

03:56.041 --> 03:59.796
Now, I think that charges of accessory
after the fact are a fitting consequence.

03:59.796 --> 04:02.507
Yeah, save the histrionics for the jury.

04:02.507 --> 04:05.218
You've created quite a shit show,
my friend.

04:05.218 --> 04:07.344
I'm ready to declare a mistrial.

04:08.387 --> 04:10.974
Your honor,
a mistrial wouldn't serve anyone.

04:10.974 --> 04:15.604
I think all parties agree we need to bring
this to a conclusion of some sort.

04:15.604 --> 04:17.021
We can try this again.
I'm not worried.

04:17.021 --> 04:18.981
Your Honor, if news of the gun
were made public,

04:18.981 --> 04:21.066
it would taint any jury going forward.

04:21.066 --> 04:22.193
Then maybe you shouldn't
have hidden it.

04:22.193 --> 04:25.614
All right, all right.
Now, here's what we're going to do.

04:26.113 --> 04:29.534
Your office will put together a brief
outlining two things:

04:29.534 --> 04:31.953
a plan for going forward with the trial

04:31.953 --> 04:35.122
and the charges you plan
to bring against Mr. Mason.

04:35.122 --> 04:38.877
This will include an argument for making
the gun admissible.

04:38.877 --> 04:42.296
And I do not want one leak
about this gun.

04:44.381 --> 04:47.301
Brief on my desk Friday morning.
That's all.

05:06.987 --> 05:08.323
Need some help?

05:09.657 --> 05:12.619
No, I'm good. Thanks.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.257
Thank you.

05:31.762 --> 05:33.305
I'm busy.

05:34.266 --> 05:35.892
Perry Mason's office.

05:37.810 --> 05:40.688
One moment.
It's Pete Strickland.

06:06.965 --> 06:08.341
Hey.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.184
You ever drink cognac?

06:19.477 --> 06:23.315
- Not really, no.
- Pussy punch is what they should call it.

06:25.065 --> 06:29.278
Is that what they're drinking down
at the D.A.'s office to celebrate?

06:36.036 --> 06:37.578
Listen...

06:41.458 --> 06:45.754
I don't like leaving things
bad between us. I just...

06:48.340 --> 06:51.175
Sometimes I get myself pulled into things,

06:52.928 --> 06:54.596
and I don't feel good about it.

06:55.013 --> 06:56.640
But I do it anyway.

06:57.682 --> 06:59.184
Yeah, I've been there.

07:04.522 --> 07:07.358
Anyway, I just needed you to hear
that from me.

07:16.952 --> 07:18.744
You broke into our safe.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.249
You shouldn't have made it so easy.

07:22.707 --> 07:24.584
How did I make it easy?

07:24.584 --> 07:28.880
You never even changed the
combination? E.B.'s birthday?

07:28.880 --> 07:31.840
How could you fucking betray me
like that?

07:31.840 --> 07:33.009
- Betray you?
- Yeah.

07:33.009 --> 07:38.139
Betray you? After all the shit that you
fucking dragged me through, Perry?

07:38.139 --> 07:40.350
Don't start that again.
Don't fucking start that again.

07:40.350 --> 07:42.561
Don't fucking tell me what to start
and not start. You know what?

07:42.561 --> 07:44.186
- We've been through this.
- You've been through this?

07:44.186 --> 07:46.397
Shut the fuck up. Scram.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.777
Just get back on your tricycle
before you embarrass yourself.

08:25.227 --> 08:26.729
Get off me!

08:57.718 --> 09:01.431
So... what are we gonna do
about the case?

09:03.225 --> 09:07.520
There's nothing to do. I'm gonna
get disbarred and thrown in jail.

09:09.731 --> 09:12.734
So that's it? Doesn't sound like you.

09:19.532 --> 09:21.493
I've got this one long shot.

09:22.661 --> 09:24.120
Clickety-clack.

09:35.465 --> 09:40.344
If I can piece together
some fucking bizarre evidence,

09:41.846 --> 09:46.935
I could possibly take down some
of the biggest names in this city.

09:49.771 --> 09:51.231
So let's do it.

09:55.025 --> 09:56.528
Della, you know how long
this meeting is gonna take?

09:56.528 --> 09:59.406
I hate leaving that corner
unmanned for too long.

09:59.406 --> 10:01.533
- So still nothing?
- No.

10:03.743 --> 10:05.744
Do you think Ozzie could've lied?

10:05.744 --> 10:09.165
No. No, Della, I can guarantee
there's no chance of that.

10:11.918 --> 10:14.628
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

10:14.628 --> 10:17.464
- I know this isn't ideal.
- No, it's far from ideal, Perry.

10:17.464 --> 10:20.010
Mason thought you all could use
an extra hand.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.512
And this is what you brought us?
I'm not working with him.

10:22.512 --> 10:23.888
Nothing's keeping you here.

10:23.888 --> 10:27.099
He is here to make amends
because he was the...

10:27.099 --> 10:29.269
Perry. Perry. Yeah, no, don't.

10:30.854 --> 10:33.189
Because he was the one
who broke into our safe.

10:33.189 --> 10:34.773
What?

10:34.773 --> 10:38.278
I'm not surprised.
Trash is trash. That's my point, Perry.

10:38.278 --> 10:40.196
You son of a bitch.
What the hell were you thinking?

10:40.196 --> 10:43.532
- Ease up, you two. Ease up.
- Stop.

10:43.532 --> 10:45.327
Dirty fucking cracker.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.205
You just call me a cracker?

10:49.205 --> 10:51.291
- You heard me.
- No, I heard you.

10:51.291 --> 10:53.084
I heard you.
You want to take it outside?

10:53.084 --> 10:54.544
- What are you gonna do?
- Stop, stop.

10:54.544 --> 10:55.669
I'll go. Let's go right now.
Stop it!

10:55.669 --> 10:56.962
- What do you what to do about it?
- Man, you shut the fuck up!

10:56.962 --> 11:01.217
- Let's go outside, Strickland...
- Stop it! What is wrong with you?

11:04.136 --> 11:07.224
You want to lose two fights today?
Be my guest.

11:07.224 --> 11:10.142
This is my responsibility. All of it.

11:10.685 --> 11:12.728
But I'm gonna ask all of you for your help

11:12.728 --> 11:17.108
'cause I think we owe those brothers
everything we've got until Friday morning.

11:17.108 --> 11:21.320
Friday morning, Pete Strickland is fair
game. You do to him whatever you want.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.030
Whatever you want.

11:25.658 --> 11:26.868
Okay.

11:28.578 --> 11:31.957
Della, he's the only one
who knows what Milligan's got.

11:32.915 --> 11:34.334
God, fuck...

11:36.085 --> 11:38.671
Thank you. Shut the fuck up.

11:42.092 --> 11:45.011
All right. With that said...

11:47.137 --> 11:50.058
Della,
what's going to ask for from this brief?

11:50.808 --> 11:54.229
He's gonna make arguments to have the
case continue with the gun in evidence.

11:54.229 --> 11:57.564
Right. And that thing will drop
on Durkin's desk in less than two days,

11:57.564 --> 11:59.900
so let's forget about where we were.

11:59.900 --> 12:02.571
Let's start with
where we are, all right?

12:06.198 --> 12:07.616
What do we know?

12:10.619 --> 12:13.123
I'm told your emperor is fond of horses.

12:13.123 --> 12:18.211
Yes. Shirayuki is Emperor Hirohito's
most cherished possession.

12:18.836 --> 12:22.549
A good steed can give joy
and pride like nothing else can.

12:23.300 --> 12:27.596
If he's ever looking for more,
I recently put an Arabian out to stud.

12:27.596 --> 12:29.306
A perfect specimen.

12:29.306 --> 12:34.059
It'd be an honor to give it to the emperor
as a gesture of my appreciation.

12:34.059 --> 12:36.937
You're very kind but not necessary.

12:37.563 --> 12:39.023
Gentlemen.

12:43.986 --> 12:48.240
Now that we've gotten all the
pomp and circumstance out of the way...

12:49.825 --> 12:53.495
Our government may be placated
for the time being,

12:53.830 --> 12:56.166
but I think it's evident
to both our companies

12:56.166 --> 12:59.710
that these shipping restrictions
will only continue to tighten.

12:59.710 --> 13:02.923
Perhaps the three of us can discuss
setting up our own operations in Japan,

13:02.923 --> 13:06.759
so we never have to worry
about another hiccup again.

13:06.759 --> 13:11.096
Yes, I think that would be
in all of our best interests.

13:11.681 --> 13:15.435
I look forward to speaking with you
gentlemen again soon.

13:23.692 --> 13:25.612
What the hell was that?

13:30.115 --> 13:34.036
It was difficult to speak with
our business partners from my seat.

13:34.036 --> 13:36.914
It would've been rude to go the whole
meal without saying hello.

13:36.914 --> 13:39.500
Come now, Lydell,
there's no conspiracy here.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.252
We all want the same thing
out of this deal.

13:46.507 --> 13:50.678
Can't we forget about business for a
moment and just speak as friends?

13:51.637 --> 13:52.930
- Friends?
- Yes.

13:53.722 --> 14:00.564
Lydell, all those unpleasant truths about
Brooks that were made so public in court.

14:01.272 --> 14:06.570
I can only imagine your shame.
But this will pass. People will move on.

14:06.903 --> 14:08.780
My grandsons won't.

14:09.698 --> 14:12.574
They'll wake up without a father
every day for the rest of their lives.

14:12.574 --> 14:14.244
And their lasting memory of him

14:14.244 --> 14:17.579
will be his name on the front pages
of the paper as a deviant.

14:17.579 --> 14:20.333
Today's newspaper wraps
tomorrow's fish.

14:21.543 --> 14:24.629
You have the power
to make people remember Brooks

14:25.129 --> 14:27.382
the way you want him to be remembered.

14:28.466 --> 14:31.510
And what do you suggest
in your infinite wisdom?

14:31.510 --> 14:33.971
Well... a monument

14:34.346 --> 14:37.891
or something that could depict Brooks

14:37.891 --> 14:44.190
in whatever you think is his best
light as opposed to all this ugliness.

14:45.525 --> 14:48.653
It could serve as a beautiful tribute
to your son.

14:51.865 --> 14:55.410
What do you know of beauty,
you fucking barren spinster?

14:56.410 --> 14:58.163
You've said enough.

15:01.081 --> 15:02.499
Of course.

15:19.058 --> 15:23.730
An act of the most egregious
moral turpitude, period.

15:23.730 --> 15:29.319
Furthermore, comma, the defense
counsel's conducts violates...

15:32.072 --> 15:33.781
What are you doing here?

15:34.990 --> 15:37.826
Remember the night
of the lightning storm?

15:38.578 --> 15:39.954
At the Adam and Eve?

15:40.914 --> 15:44.333
Your friend, the architect,
stumbled over to our table and...

15:44.333 --> 15:47.086
I do, and voice down.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.507
What did I say when he left?

15:54.052 --> 15:55.844
Yeah, you said...

15:58.055 --> 16:02.726
"And here I thought I was the only
modern architecture enthusiast around."

16:05.689 --> 16:09.650
That was the best night.
To know I wasn't alone.

16:10.610 --> 16:12.028
What is this, Della?

16:13.196 --> 16:14.239
I'm concerned.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.531
- About?
- You.

16:20.370 --> 16:24.873
If someone leaned on you
to offer us that plea deal,

16:25.333 --> 16:26.583
if they're still leaning on you...

16:26.583 --> 16:28.168
Stop it. Stop it.

16:30.087 --> 16:33.507
Honestly,
I don't know if I'm more offended

16:33.507 --> 16:36.177
that you would exploit our friendship
to try to win a case

16:36.177 --> 16:40.307
or that you actually thought this I'm
concerned move would work on me.

16:40.307 --> 16:43.684
I am concerned.
And I want to finish what I started.

16:45.186 --> 16:46.270
It is finished.

16:46.270 --> 16:49.316
No, it's more than the gun
and the brothers, and you know that.

16:49.316 --> 16:51.318
You had one good day in court.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.654
Do you think that means
you can change the world?

16:56.239 --> 16:59.408
Ham, I'm looking for the truth.

17:17.134 --> 17:18.637
You won't like it.

17:42.661 --> 17:43.994
Blackmail?

17:46.497 --> 17:48.499
By whom? Lydell?

17:51.627 --> 17:53.338
I don't know who it is.

17:59.176 --> 18:00.469
Ham...

18:05.474 --> 18:07.017
I'm so sorry.

18:08.227 --> 18:11.105
I am so careful, and they still got in.

18:12.607 --> 18:18.445
You cannot and should not
go poking into this.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.657
It's not worth it.

18:20.657 --> 18:23.701
If we can figure out who's behind the
blackmail, we can hit them back.

18:23.701 --> 18:29.833
Christ, you're starting to sound
like Mason. Accept defeat gracefully.

18:30.584 --> 18:33.002
- Let the feds handle the rest.
- Feds?

18:34.628 --> 18:37.048
Why would the feds handle anything?

18:37.048 --> 18:39.467
Just let it go.

18:43.597 --> 18:45.097
Anything else?

19:11.541 --> 19:13.043
Where is Rafael?

19:13.627 --> 19:16.212
They're not letting him see visitors.

19:16.212 --> 19:18.130
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

19:27.390 --> 19:30.310
- Mr. Mason told us that they found...
- I know.

19:34.355 --> 19:36.316
I still cannot understand

19:37.149 --> 19:39.945
how you could have done
such a stupid thing.

19:41.070 --> 19:42.739
Such a horrible thing.

19:44.198 --> 19:48.245
That's what a person does
when they don't have any other options.

19:56.210 --> 19:58.713
I had so much hope for you two.

20:02.216 --> 20:05.178
For the futures you had.

20:15.146 --> 20:16.731
Take it.

20:32.121 --> 20:33.998
He got accepted to art school.

20:36.041 --> 20:38.168
I didn't even know he applied.

20:43.132 --> 20:46.760
I'll let you decide if you want
to give it to him or not.

21:18.460 --> 21:21.254
He's become a liability.
I don't like it.

21:23.089 --> 21:27.260
You saw him at the lunch.
He snapped at me out of nowhere.

21:27.260 --> 21:31.889
That sort of display is frowned upon,
especially amongst the Orientals.

21:32.640 --> 21:36.228
Perhaps he doesn't like it when
you undercut him in public.

21:38.813 --> 21:39.980
Which reminds me.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.567
Did you remember to send our Japanese
friends an invitation to the concert?

21:43.567 --> 21:46.905
It was hand-delivered to the embassy
this morning.

21:50.908 --> 21:53.328
Anything on your mind, Phippsy?

21:56.622 --> 21:57.665
I'm fine.

21:58.749 --> 22:01.211
No, you're not. You're distant.

22:05.590 --> 22:09.010
If you're not pleased with my work,
you should say so.

22:09.010 --> 22:10.553
Don't be paranoid.

22:13.097 --> 22:17.102
All I'm suggesting is...
you seem tired.

22:18.519 --> 22:22.857
Yes, well, the sun never sets
on the Nygaard Empire.

22:28.613 --> 22:30.115
I've been thinking...

22:31.741 --> 22:35.287
I wonder if there's room
for Della Street in our office.

22:53.721 --> 22:56.224
- What do you know, fucko?
- God damn it.

22:59.518 --> 23:02.731
Take a look.
Place is swarming with inspectors.

23:02.731 --> 23:03.982
Really?

23:04.398 --> 23:07.234
Who knew the federal government
cared so much about produce?

23:07.234 --> 23:10.195
Come on. You tellin' me this
is all about price gouging?

23:10.195 --> 23:12.365
Yeah. Does the DA know that you're
moonlightin' for the other side?

23:12.365 --> 23:14.116
Does your wife know you're
moonlightin' as an asshole?

23:14.116 --> 23:17.078
All right. How often
do these boats leave port?

23:17.411 --> 23:20.789
No idea. My guy in the fed office
says they always leave at night.

23:20.789 --> 23:23.167
So clearly, they don't want people to see
what they're dumping.

23:23.167 --> 23:26.421
- Any idea where they're headed?
- Some port in Japan.

23:26.922 --> 23:28.840
We got to get on that boat.
Get a better look.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.466
Figure out why
they're dumping all that veg.

23:30.466 --> 23:31.968
And that's my cue.

23:33.302 --> 23:36.097
- It's been lovely, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

23:44.521 --> 23:47.317
Say, think we can pass for deckhands?

23:47.317 --> 23:49.485
Did you hear what he said?
It's headed to Japan.

23:49.485 --> 23:54.282
Yeah, but they gotta be dumping it close
to shore; otherwise, it wouldn't wash up.

23:54.282 --> 23:57.953
So we go, see why, grab a lifeboat,
and get outta there.

23:59.746 --> 24:01.288
All right, let's try.

24:02.247 --> 24:03.917
I'd lose the leather jacket.

24:03.917 --> 24:06.919
What? What?
What if I'm freezing on the boat?

24:07.795 --> 24:10.465
Ever known a deckhand
to wear leather?

25:13.361 --> 25:14.863
- Hey, Mason.
- What?

25:14.863 --> 25:18.449
- Put that on.
- It's still gonna be fucking freezing.

25:18.449 --> 25:20.242
- Just put it on.
- Shut up.

25:28.792 --> 25:31.211
- Hey, you feel that?
- What?

25:31.211 --> 25:33.213
- Feels like we're stopped.
- Release the bow!

25:33.213 --> 25:35.508
I told you it wouldn't be far.

25:36.634 --> 25:38.553
- Clear the halyard.
- Here we go.

26:02.827 --> 26:06.790
Holy shit, Perry.
It's another fucking boat.

26:07.623 --> 26:09.541
Oh my god.

26:14.089 --> 26:15.840
Would you look at that?

26:26.475 --> 26:30.772
- That's black gold, Perry.
- Yeah. That's a lot of oil.

26:31.689 --> 26:33.440
What the hell you think
they're doing with it?

26:33.440 --> 26:35.735
I don't know,
but we don't have time to find out.

26:35.735 --> 26:39.114
We gotta get the fuck
off this thing. Let's go.

26:40.281 --> 26:41.532
Mase, lifeboat.

26:42.074 --> 26:46.287
What? Those things hold 40 people.
You don't think we'll get noticed?

26:46.705 --> 26:48.080
Shit.

26:50.124 --> 26:53.794
You know what? I can still make out the
shore from here. We ain't that far.

26:53.794 --> 26:56.047
We just got to grab one of them crates
that they threw over the side.

26:56.047 --> 26:59.676
What? Hold on. Hold on.
You're not suggesting we swim back?

27:00.384 --> 27:03.512
I don't know...
Either that or learn Japanese.

27:06.433 --> 27:08.100
God damn it!

27:11.897 --> 27:15.358
Hey. We'll be on land in an hour tops.

27:43.219 --> 27:45.137
Holy fucking god.

27:46.139 --> 27:49.142
You thought stealing a horse
was going too far?

28:20.881 --> 28:22.884
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:25.178 --> 28:28.807
- What are you doing here?
- How else am I supposed to see you?

28:28.807 --> 28:30.724
You left before breakfast.

28:32.393 --> 28:33.728
Thank you.

28:35.313 --> 28:36.772
Clara.

28:39.276 --> 28:41.278
I don't need the hows and the whys.

28:41.278 --> 28:44.489
You want to keep it locked up, fine,
I'll respect it.

28:44.489 --> 28:50.619
Clara, I'm just up to my neck on this one,
and I don't want you drowning, too.

28:50.619 --> 28:53.163
Paul, if you drownin', I'm drownin'.

28:54.583 --> 28:59.588
So whatever happened, I don't need you
treating me like I was the one who did it.

29:02.132 --> 29:03.590
You're right.

29:04.967 --> 29:06.468
It's just...

29:07.637 --> 29:12.100
Clara, the choices I made,
they used to have fewer consequences.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.394
They didn't have this long reach.

29:16.645 --> 29:18.272
What does that mean?

29:20.858 --> 29:22.901
It means I'm scared, Clara.

29:25.279 --> 29:28.199
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

29:32.996 --> 29:34.581
Listen...

29:49.054 --> 29:50.346
Come here.

29:52.932 --> 29:54.267
You look tired.

29:56.226 --> 29:58.354
I'm not gonna fight you on that one.

29:58.730 --> 30:02.816
Maybe you should rest a while.
I could watch the corner.

30:02.816 --> 30:05.820
- No, no, no.
- Why? What?

30:06.153 --> 30:08.949
What? It's a bad idea, Clara.
It's dangerous.

30:08.949 --> 30:13.328
How so? I'm just watching and writing.
You need to rest.

30:14.495 --> 30:18.165
Something happens in the next hour,
trust me, I'll wake you.

30:19.626 --> 30:20.961
Fine.

30:22.712 --> 30:26.048
- We're looking for...
- Old white man in a fancy red car.

30:26.048 --> 30:27.217
Clara.

30:28.384 --> 30:33.390
I know. White girl. Blue sedan. Now
shut your mouth and close your eyes.

30:35.475 --> 30:39.229
Okay. Okay.

30:51.282 --> 30:53.575
Thank you, Clara Drake.

31:14.263 --> 31:15.390
What is this?

31:15.390 --> 31:18.142
It's passage on the Santa Paula
to Havana.

31:21.020 --> 31:22.354
Why am I going there?

31:22.354 --> 31:25.775
Because you won't accept reality,
and I have no other choice with you.

31:26.902 --> 31:28.777
I'll tell Elizabeth and the boys
it's for the company.

31:28.777 --> 31:30.696
If this is about announcing the team
at the soup kitchen,

31:30.696 --> 31:32.531
you have to trust me that...

31:34.117 --> 31:36.410
Every time I tell you to do something,

31:36.410 --> 31:39.538
it blows through your ears
like the goddamn wind.

31:41.958 --> 31:45.502
There are other people who matter
in all yourfuck-ups.

31:47.296 --> 31:48.757
What other people?

31:54.678 --> 31:56.430
This is about the subpoena.

31:57.641 --> 32:00.309
You will get on that boat,
you will stay in Havana,

32:00.309 --> 32:03.104
and you will not come back
until I tell you to.

32:13.323 --> 32:15.825
Concentrate on your charity work.

32:18.118 --> 32:20.538
- What?
- Those were your words to me.

32:21.163 --> 32:22.790
And that's what I did...

32:23.624 --> 32:27.419
taking all that produce
you were greedily wasting.

32:27.419 --> 32:29.797
Feeding a nation that's starving.

32:31.131 --> 32:33.968
I think the feds would understand that.

32:33.968 --> 32:38.306
I didn't tell you about it, but what
are we talking here? A fine at worst?

32:39.974 --> 32:42.686
But this illegal oil deal
you have going...

32:42.686 --> 32:46.064
Yeah. I have nothing to do with that.

32:46.439 --> 32:50.860
I mean, you made it very clear I was to
have nothing to do with your business.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.486
My hands are clean.

32:53.070 --> 32:56.949
So, I'm not so sure I'm the one with the
real fuck-ups right now, am I, father?

32:57.367 --> 32:59.576
I don't think I'm going anywhere.

33:16.510 --> 33:17.553
From what I understand,

33:17.553 --> 33:21.974
Brooks McCutcheon was under federal
investigation before his death.

33:22.350 --> 33:26.604
And the Bureau said you were the man
to see about the matter.

33:37.949 --> 33:38.992
Brooks was doing business

33:38.992 --> 33:42.578
with a produce distributor
named Charlie Goldstein.

33:42.578 --> 33:43.912
He certainly was.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.665
Two of them made a nice little piece
of change

33:46.665 --> 33:48.710
selling produce around the country.

33:48.710 --> 33:50.878
Trouble is,
they neglected to notify us first.

33:50.878 --> 33:52.797
Do you think they knew you were
investigating them?

33:52.797 --> 33:55.841
Think the subpoenas probably
tipped 'em off, yeah.

33:56.634 --> 33:58.303
Brooks and Goldstein were subpoenaed?

33:58.803 --> 34:03.016
Called to testify before a grand jury.
Neither one made it.

34:07.895 --> 34:12.400
Is the case file confidential?
Do you have access to it?

34:15.194 --> 34:17.405
Yes. And yes.

34:19.699 --> 34:22.201
- Just a moment.
- Of course.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.568
What?

34:54.568 --> 34:58.362
Nah, I'm just remembering
the first time you assisted me...

34:58.362 --> 35:01.323
that rent party around the corner
from here.

35:02.951 --> 35:05.036
How long had you been on the force,
about a week?

35:05.036 --> 35:06.453
No, five days.

35:07.037 --> 35:10.333
The first big assignment
I had on my own,

35:10.708 --> 35:14.044
and he said Drake,
your people too loud.

35:14.044 --> 35:16.756
You've got to go down
there and break that up.

35:17.464 --> 35:18.550
But I walked through that door

35:18.550 --> 35:21.720
and see the most gorgeous woman
I've ever seen.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.178
She is dancing.

35:23.178 --> 35:26.474
Oh my goodness, in a way that make
the good Lord blush.

35:26.474 --> 35:27.850
You such a liar.

35:29.435 --> 35:31.688
Then you get right up in my face.
You remember what you said?

35:31.688 --> 35:34.482
I never forgot.
I said, "Look here, cop.

35:34.940 --> 35:36.942
"Either you start moving your feet
to this beat,

35:36.942 --> 35:40.112
"or you take your Black ass back
out on that street."

35:41.238 --> 35:43.617
Oh, Clara Drake...

35:45.367 --> 35:49.873
I'm so happy that I started moving my
feet with you and not out that door.

35:51.582 --> 35:54.127
- Til them other police came.
- I know.

35:55.336 --> 35:57.714
And you had to duck out that back
bedroom window

35:57.714 --> 36:00.300
with your pants around your ankles.

36:07.557 --> 36:08.891
Paul.

36:11.853 --> 36:13.145
That's her.

36:15.398 --> 36:16.816
Okay.

36:17.816 --> 36:19.152
That's it.

36:49.683 --> 36:51.558
It must have been a hard...

36:54.938 --> 36:58.024
- I thought you were Mr. Denning.
- Mr. Denning had an emergency.

36:58.482 --> 37:01.026
He won't be coming back
to the office today.

37:01.026 --> 37:04.364
- But he was just...
- That'll be all, Miss Street.

37:46.780 --> 37:47.823
Mason & Associates.

37:47.823 --> 37:51.828
Marion, it's Della. I need
to speak to Perry. It's urgent.

37:52.829 --> 37:55.748
Della thinks Brooks was taking the
produce that Lydell was dumping

37:55.748 --> 37:58.209
and selling it on the black market.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.919
Another losing scheme by
the bumbling prince of the city.

38:00.919 --> 38:02.797
Yeah, but the feds got wind of it.

38:02.797 --> 38:06.301
So they subpoena him and Goldstein
to testify about the scam.

38:06.301 --> 38:09.095
And someone's worried that's not the
only thing they'll testify about, huh?

38:09.095 --> 38:10.680
Ain't that the truth.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.728
So then why the big charade?

38:18.562 --> 38:23.359
Why pretend to send veg to Japan
and sneak on all that oil?

38:23.359 --> 38:27.655
That I don't know. Maybe he's trying
to hide his profits from the government?

38:27.655 --> 38:28.782
Yeah.

38:28.782 --> 38:31.868
- May I offer something?
- Yeah, of course.

38:33.327 --> 38:37.624
Could it be possible the Japanese
are using the oil for their military?

38:37.998 --> 38:40.293
- Who are they at war with?
- Oh my god.

38:40.293 --> 38:44.630
They've taken over Korea, Manchuria...
China will probably be next.

38:48.384 --> 38:49.761
See, it's here.

38:51.179 --> 38:54.014
League Member Nations
call for embargoes on Japan.

38:54.014 --> 38:55.976
And McCutcheon clearly wouldn't
want anyone knowing

38:55.976 --> 38:57.268
he was selling oil to them.

38:57.268 --> 38:58.894
Making buckets
of cash under the table.

38:58.894 --> 39:02.607
And Brooks' little side scam was shining
a very bright light on Daddy's bigger one.

39:02.607 --> 39:05.443
So, Daddy needed to extinguish
that light.

39:06.610 --> 39:07.904
If that's true, that means...

39:07.904 --> 39:10.574
Lydell really did have
his own son killed.

39:54.033 --> 39:55.200
Clara, you wait here.

39:55.200 --> 39:58.662
Paul, you can't go up to that house.
Not around here.

40:08.298 --> 40:10.050
So what do I say?

40:13.969 --> 40:15.554
How about I'm a maid looking for work?

40:15.554 --> 40:18.182
No, no, no, Clara.
We've got to get a name.

40:19.141 --> 40:22.227
How 'bout you're Jehovah's Witness?

40:22.227 --> 40:23.729
I don't know nothing about those people.

40:23.729 --> 40:26.899
Clara, Clara, all you've got to do,
ask for a donation.

40:26.899 --> 40:28.109
Then you ask for their name

40:28.109 --> 40:31.404
so you can inscribe them into the
Kingdom of Heaven.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.910
Clara, you sure about this?

40:38.410 --> 40:39.663
Hell no.

40:41.455 --> 40:42.832
Be careful.

41:31.672 --> 41:33.674
- Hello?
- Hello?

41:35.885 --> 41:39.430
Ma'am, I was wondering
if I could have a moment of your time.

41:41.141 --> 41:42.516
Come in.

42:00.784 --> 42:02.078
Hello?

42:04.247 --> 42:05.581
Hello?

42:07.751 --> 42:09.084
Hello?

42:10.837 --> 42:12.296
Ma'am?

42:14.214 --> 42:15.424
Ma'am?

42:26.019 --> 42:27.478
I know you.

42:31.233 --> 42:32.483
You do?

42:34.234 --> 42:36.278
You're Josephine Baker.

42:40.617 --> 42:42.034
No, ma'am.

42:44.078 --> 42:48.541
You're such a beautiful negro, Josephine.

42:52.795 --> 42:55.005
Have you come to dance for me?

43:00.094 --> 43:02.013
Let me play you something.

43:08.644 --> 43:10.062
Ma'am?

43:12.941 --> 43:13.942
Pull!

43:18.238 --> 43:20.030
You're anticipating, Phillip.

43:20.030 --> 43:23.952
Wait until the pigeon is at the high point
of its trajectory.

43:23.952 --> 43:27.746
And don't lean back so much.
Weight forward. Watch.

43:31.126 --> 43:32.543
Pull!

43:36.130 --> 43:37.549
See what I mean?

43:38.550 --> 43:43.470
You should listen to your grandfather.
He knows plenty about hitting targets.

43:46.224 --> 43:48.100
What are you doing here, Mason?

43:49.519 --> 43:52.313
Just returning something you dropped.

43:58.652 --> 44:00.571
- Phillip.
- Yes, sir?

44:00.571 --> 44:01.907
Go play.

44:07.120 --> 44:08.163
This whole time

44:08.163 --> 44:12.292
I thought you were worried about
protecting your son's name,

44:12.292 --> 44:16.588
but you were just protecting
your profits.

44:17.463 --> 44:20.884
Now, don't get me wrong,
I'm a lousy dad.

44:20.884 --> 44:23.303
But I would do anything
to protect my son.

44:23.677 --> 44:26.764
- Just get to what you want.
- I want a fair deal for my clients.

44:27.098 --> 44:30.685
- And just how am I supposed to do that?
- You work that out with Burger.

44:30.685 --> 44:33.646
But you bring us something
better this time

44:33.646 --> 44:35.357
because if you don't,

44:36.065 --> 44:39.444
if I'm suddenly no longer around
when this offer is completed,

44:39.444 --> 44:41.862
then all my research goes to the FBI
and the press,

44:41.862 --> 44:44.949
telling them that you've been feeding
the fish more fruits and vegetables

44:44.949 --> 44:46.868
than you have people
in your own soup kitchen.

44:46.868 --> 44:48.370
- No.
- No, no. I can tell them more.

44:48.370 --> 44:49.787
I can tell them a whole lot more.

44:49.787 --> 44:52.624
How you illegally schemed
with the Japanese to sell them oil.

44:53.041 --> 44:57.544
And how you had such little faith in your
own son not to tell people about it

44:58.213 --> 45:00.423
that you paid to have him executed.

45:00.423 --> 45:04.802
I did nothing but try to save him!
But he wouldn't let me.

45:05.512 --> 45:09.724
And you and everyone else made it
impossible to protect his name.

45:10.767 --> 45:12.894
I won't take the blame for this.

45:18.525 --> 45:20.859
Hey! Hey, you in the car.

45:24.530 --> 45:27.241
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- You can't just park here.

45:27.241 --> 45:28.994
I'm just waiting for my wife.

45:28.994 --> 45:31.246
She works in the kitchen in one of them
houses over there.

45:32.581 --> 45:36.376
- I've never seen you here before.
- I know. She just started.

45:36.376 --> 45:41.089
She should be out, any second now, and
then we gonna be right out your way.

45:44.759 --> 45:46.344
Thank you, ma'am.

45:47.762 --> 45:49.763
Shit. Come on, Clara.

45:57.230 --> 45:58.522
Shit.

46:02.109 --> 46:03.819
I'm home.

46:06.363 --> 46:09.366
Any interest in going
to Perino's this evening?

46:10.201 --> 46:14.998
I ran into Gerald Nance, who said that he
and his wife were headed there...

46:16.874 --> 46:20.919
Constance!
Constance! Constance!

46:22.421 --> 46:25.591
Constance! Oh, god damn it!

46:26.426 --> 46:29.261
How much did you use? Constance!

46:30.804 --> 46:32.015
Fuck!

46:40.398 --> 46:45.570
I need an ambulance sent to the Phipps
residence. 820 North Canon Drive.

46:46.696 --> 46:49.031
820 North Canon Drive.

46:50.115 --> 46:52.869
Yes. Yes, I understand. Please hurry.

47:12.137 --> 47:14.139
- Are you okay?
- Paul, drive.

47:17.477 --> 47:20.146
Brooks was clearly a liability to you.

47:22.190 --> 47:24.650
How are you not to blame for his death?

47:26.193 --> 47:29.614
Because I didn't want it, god damn it!

47:31.282 --> 47:32.783
Then who did?

48:22.875 --> 48:24.169
Rafa?

48:25.754 --> 48:27.004
Rafa?

49:28.023 --> 49:31.945
Pardon the interruption, Miss Nygaard.
From this afternoon.

49:49.296 --> 49:51.463
Get Mr. Phipps on the phone.
