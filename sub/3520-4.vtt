WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:08.301
Yeah, no, that's fine. That's...

00:08.468 --> 00:10.095
I can-- I can totally do that.

00:10.261 --> 00:13.431
That's, uh, perfect, actually.

00:13.598 --> 00:16.518
So, I will see you...

00:16.685 --> 00:18.853
Okay. Okay.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.480
Well... bye.

00:20.647 --> 00:23.316
Okay, sit.

00:23.483 --> 00:25.318
- Oh, God.
- Now...

00:25.485 --> 00:26.778
You will have a heart attack,

00:26.945 --> 00:29.531
but at least you will have
a proper English fry-up.

00:29.698 --> 00:31.324
Okay, everything
on this plate is insane.

00:31.491 --> 00:33.618
If I eat any of this,
I'm gonna gain 400 pounds.

00:33.785 --> 00:35.286
Oh, you're not fat, Patrick.

00:35.453 --> 00:38.248
I used to be,
and on the inside, I still am.

00:38.415 --> 00:41.334
I am one ill-timed binge away
from being "Fatrick" again.

00:41.501 --> 00:43.712
Is that what
they used to call you at school?

00:43.878 --> 00:45.505
Oh, yeah. Fatrick, Biscuit...

00:45.672 --> 00:47.298
My sister Megan, though,
she was the worst.

00:47.465 --> 00:49.050
She called me
"Fat, fat frog."

00:49.217 --> 00:51.928
Well, I wish they could
all see the gorgeous, virile,

00:52.095 --> 00:53.430
sex machine you've become.

00:53.596 --> 00:54.848
And let me tell you something,

00:55.014 --> 00:59.060
they will all be fat, fat frogs
themselves now.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.730
<i>Bon appétit!</i>

01:01.896 --> 01:04.315
So, um, last night...

01:04.482 --> 01:06.818
You gave me the fuck
of my life?

01:06.985 --> 01:09.529
- Sorry. Carry on.
- Right.

01:09.696 --> 01:11.448
No, um, after that,

01:11.614 --> 01:14.826
I wasn't intentionally
eavesdropping, but I heard...

01:19.289 --> 01:23.626
Do you and Jon call each other
every night when he's out of town?

01:23.793 --> 01:25.295
Uh, yeah.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.340
I brought it up, but we don't need
to get into this right now.

01:29.507 --> 01:32.177
- Well, I think we should.
- Yeah, me too.

01:34.596 --> 01:36.514
Okay. Uh...

01:36.681 --> 01:41.227
What do... What do you want
to know that you don't already?

01:41.394 --> 01:43.188
How do you feel
when you go back to Jon?

01:43.354 --> 01:45.398
After we've been together?

01:48.026 --> 01:50.236
- Pretty fucking shitty.
- I...

01:51.738 --> 01:52.947
I feel the same way...

01:53.114 --> 01:54.282
- No.
- ...as soon as you leave.

01:54.449 --> 01:57.827
The way we are
with each other,

01:57.994 --> 01:59.496
the way we were together
last night,

01:59.662 --> 02:02.040
I don't have that
with Jon.

02:04.042 --> 02:07.295
Look, I promise you,
this will sort itself.

02:07.462 --> 02:08.838
I will sort it.

02:11.466 --> 02:14.177
- Okay?
- I hope so. I hope that's true.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.360
Really?

02:30.527 --> 02:33.613
Oh, does the Queen of England
not approve of anal?

02:33.780 --> 02:36.157
No, I heart anal, too.

02:43.039 --> 02:44.916
Is that your cocktail?

02:45.083 --> 02:47.627
Uh, this pill
is my cocktail,

02:47.794 --> 02:49.254
this is my fish oil,

02:49.420 --> 02:50.964
this is
my B-12 with zinc,

02:51.130 --> 02:52.590
and that's my One-A-Day.

02:52.757 --> 02:54.300
Any other questions?

02:56.177 --> 02:58.680
So, you want
to get breakfast?

02:58.847 --> 02:59.931
I can't.

03:00.098 --> 03:02.517
I have to go to the shelter.
I got my trans kids.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.854
Well, can I just wait in here
for a little bit?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.690
You know, at least until Patrick
texts me that it's safe to go home.

03:08.857 --> 03:10.358
No.

03:10.525 --> 03:12.026
- What?
- I'm not leaving you alone

03:12.193 --> 03:14.988
in my apartment.
Go to the library.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.197
Mm!

03:16.406 --> 03:18.950
Or come with me to the shelter.
They have snacks.

03:25.623 --> 03:28.418
Okay. What do you
want your password to be?

03:28.585 --> 03:30.837
A childhood pet
or the street you grew up on?

03:31.004 --> 03:33.673
- Password for...?
- Kickstarter.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.633
It's what all the kids
with dreams are doing.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.552
Oh, my God, are we finally
making our movie

03:37.719 --> 03:39.721
about a young rent boy's
sexual coming of age?

03:39.888 --> 03:41.764
Yes, of course, and the hag
who loved him.

03:41.931 --> 03:43.474
No, that will be next.
That's amazing.

03:43.641 --> 03:47.645
This is so we can rent
your chicken window, okay?

03:47.812 --> 03:49.063
Fuck those phantom investors.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.565
We're gonna make
this happen for you.

03:50.732 --> 03:52.191
Kickstarter doesn't...

03:52.358 --> 03:53.818
Food doesn't
work that way.

03:53.985 --> 03:55.653
Oh, really? Well, okay.
Blah-blah-blah.

03:55.820 --> 03:58.239
All I need from you
is a password.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.116
I also need a little paragraph
about how

04:00.283 --> 04:02.702
this has always been
your lifelong passion,

04:02.869 --> 04:05.705
um, and you have to offer
some sort of incentives.

04:05.872 --> 04:09.417
- Some kind of... I don't know...
- Or something.

04:09.584 --> 04:12.003
Doris, I'm not
doing Kickstarter.

04:12.170 --> 04:14.255
It's desperate.

04:14.422 --> 04:18.801
Uh, is that you
or Lynn talking?

04:18.968 --> 04:20.011
Hmm...

04:25.892 --> 04:27.185
- Hey, what's up, man?
<i>- Hey.</i>

04:27.393 --> 04:29.395
I'm actually a little busy right now.
I'm about to go into this--

04:29.562 --> 04:32.231
<i>So, Richie called me,
this morning.</i>

04:32.398 --> 04:34.108
Oh, well, that's good.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.818
<i>Yeah, sure it's good,
I know, but I just...</i>

04:35.985 --> 04:37.362
- Agustín!
<i>- ... don't know really what</i>

04:37.528 --> 04:39.697
<i>- we're supposed to be doing exactly.</i>
- Um, um, look, uh...

04:39.864 --> 04:40.949
isn't this what
you wanted?

04:41.115 --> 04:43.201
You know? To reconnect
and be friends?

04:43.368 --> 04:44.702
<i>Don't start
freaking out, okay?</i>

04:44.869 --> 04:46.537
No, Agustín,
I'm not freaking out.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.498
It's just that this was my idea,
and now that it's happening,

04:48.665 --> 04:51.376
I'm like... "How does this work?"
He doesn't even know about Kevin.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.252
Oh, shit. Fuck, I gotta go.

04:53.419 --> 04:54.879
- Okay. Bye.
<i>- All right.</i>

04:56.255 --> 04:57.423
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.718
- Sorry, I'm... just...
- It's okay.

05:00.885 --> 05:02.303
Heh.

05:04.514 --> 05:07.475
So, um, what
do you want to do?

05:07.642 --> 05:09.644
I don't know.
You hungry?

05:09.811 --> 05:11.854
I just had
a big breakfast.

05:12.021 --> 05:13.856
But I...
maybe we... Ice cream?

05:14.023 --> 05:15.400
Do you want
to have ice cream?

05:15.566 --> 05:17.151
Um...

05:17.318 --> 05:18.569
Yeah, all right. Yeah.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.321
- I'll go for some ice cream.
- Okay.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.661
Isn't it weird, in San Francisco,
how people love to wait in line?

05:26.828 --> 05:29.414
I mean, yes, this honey lavender
ice cream is delicious,

05:29.580 --> 05:33.042
but is it really worth
waiting 45 minutes?

05:33.209 --> 05:34.502
It's Bi-Rite, Patrick.

05:34.669 --> 05:36.295
No. Yes. No, I know that
it's Bi-Rite,

05:36.462 --> 05:38.464
but you can get the exact
same kind of ice cream

05:38.631 --> 05:40.425
one block away,
at the Bi-Rite Market.

05:40.591 --> 05:45.096
But, you know,
then it wouldn't be an experience.

05:45.263 --> 05:46.681
I hear you.

05:46.848 --> 05:49.183
I walk around the Mission
and see all these salons

05:49.350 --> 05:52.520
that charge, like, five times
what we're charging.

05:52.687 --> 05:54.439
And people waiting, like,
hella hours for an appointment.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.399
Yes, and they're not getting
any better haircuts than

05:56.566 --> 05:58.026
what you give.
It's all about hype.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.819
You know what?

05:59.986 --> 06:01.696
I'm not gonna get a haircut
anywhere else

06:01.863 --> 06:03.823
other than your shop
from now on.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.451
Um, you have a stylist.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.286
You need to stay
loyal to him.

06:10.705 --> 06:11.998
Come on.

06:14.751 --> 06:16.544
So, you going by
Esta Noche, tonight?

06:16.711 --> 06:18.629
- Oh, yeah.
- Pay your respects.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.298
Right, I was thinking about it,

06:20.465 --> 06:22.133
but it's gonna be super
stonewally, right?

06:22.300 --> 06:24.260
Drag queens and police
in riot gear.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.511
Oh.

06:25.678 --> 06:29.015
In case you are, I wanted you
to know, because when you asked...

06:29.182 --> 06:31.017
if I was seeing someone.

06:34.645 --> 06:35.980
You are.

06:37.648 --> 06:39.567
That's cool.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.903
What, um...

06:42.070 --> 06:43.988
What's his name?

06:44.155 --> 06:47.075
- Brady.
- Brady.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.326
- Brady.
- Yeah.

06:48.493 --> 06:50.161
- Brady. Okay.
- What?

06:50.328 --> 06:52.038
No, it's very...

06:52.205 --> 06:56.626
Anglo-Saxon.
Very... "Lord Brady."

06:56.793 --> 06:58.086
He's got red hair.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.922
He's a ginge?

07:01.089 --> 07:03.216
Wow, you're dating
a ginge. Huh.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.051
Interesting.
Well, he must be super-hot.

07:05.218 --> 07:07.261
'Cause you know, with gingers,
they're either hot or they're...

07:07.428 --> 07:10.389
- He's hot.
- Okay.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.974
Great.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.726
Um, and we've only
hung out a couple times,

07:13.893 --> 07:15.436
but I wanted you to know,
in case you were thinking...

07:15.561 --> 07:16.896
No, no, no!
This was just...

07:17.063 --> 07:19.857
I... I just...
I wanted to reconnect...

07:20.024 --> 07:22.860
and to see
if we could be friends.

07:23.027 --> 07:25.071
Why do we need to be?
We weren't friends before?

07:25.238 --> 07:28.991
We don't need to be,
but I'd like to be.

07:29.158 --> 07:31.285
There's nothing
ulterior. Really.

07:31.452 --> 07:34.580
I'm...

07:34.747 --> 07:37.583
I'm actually
seeing someone, too.

07:37.750 --> 07:38.876
Oh, yeah?

07:39.043 --> 07:40.711
Yeah. It's a little weird,
which is why I haven't talked

07:40.878 --> 07:44.257
about it a lot.
But, um...

07:44.423 --> 07:46.759
Well, you remember Kevin?

07:46.926 --> 07:48.427
Kevin? Your boss, Kevin?

07:48.594 --> 07:50.429
Yeah. That's what's weird.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.390
The whole boss thing.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.601
Doesn't he
have a partner?

07:57.395 --> 07:58.896
He does,

07:59.063 --> 08:00.731
which is also weird.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.066
But, he's...

08:02.233 --> 08:03.734
You know, they're
apart a lot of the time.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.653
So, they have
an arrangement?

08:05.820 --> 08:07.738
Oh, no,
I don't...

08:07.905 --> 08:09.615
No.

08:09.782 --> 08:11.742
You a home wrecker,
now, Patrick?

08:13.411 --> 08:16.038
No.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.415
No, it's not
like that.

08:17.582 --> 08:20.001
No, they're having
a lot of issues right now,

08:20.168 --> 08:21.419
and, um...

08:21.586 --> 08:23.671
this kind of caught us
both by surprise,

08:23.838 --> 08:25.464
so we're just-- you know,
we're figuring it out.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.968
It's none of
my business, but...

08:29.135 --> 08:32.388
you don't want to be in deeper
than the person you're with.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.056
It's never good.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.101
And if there's something bad
happening between

08:37.268 --> 08:41.397
- those two guys...
I'm being careful, Richie.

08:41.564 --> 08:42.857
It's fine.

08:50.198 --> 08:51.782
You trans?

08:51.949 --> 08:53.284
Do I look trans?

08:53.451 --> 08:54.744
But you're queer, right?

08:54.911 --> 08:56.704
No, I'm gay.

08:56.871 --> 08:58.956
Are you the new
Ms. Charmenko?

08:59.123 --> 09:00.166
I don't know
who that is.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.043
She used
to work here.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.170
He's Eddie's new
boyfriend, Chloe.

09:04.337 --> 09:06.631
- Um, no. No.
- You poz, too?

09:06.756 --> 09:07.840
Um...

09:07.965 --> 09:11.302
Hey, y'all. This is Agustín.
He's a friend.

09:11.469 --> 09:13.930
And he's visiting
for the day, so be nice.

09:14.096 --> 09:15.514
Um, and we're
gonna get started again,

09:15.681 --> 09:17.516
so come on, people.
Let's all sit down.

09:17.683 --> 09:21.062
All right, everybody! Let's go.
We're gonna get started again.

09:21.229 --> 09:22.688
Chloe, sit down.

09:26.025 --> 09:28.319
Great.
And I have an idea.

09:28.486 --> 09:31.697
Something different.
Uh... wouldn't it be fun if Agustín

09:31.864 --> 09:34.200
joins us in circle, today.
What do you think?

09:36.077 --> 09:37.787
Who's Mrs. Charmenko?

09:37.954 --> 09:40.581
Uh, Josie. She used
to work in the office.

09:40.748 --> 09:41.999
She retired.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.709
They're looking
for a replacement.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.753
Is that something
I can do?

09:45.920 --> 09:48.256
I mean, unless there's some kind of
special requirement.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.799
Yeah. High school diploma.

09:49.966 --> 09:51.842
The pay is shit-tay!

09:52.009 --> 09:53.678
Well, I'm not making
any money right now,

09:53.844 --> 09:55.680
so even minimum wage
would be great.

09:55.846 --> 09:58.641
It's minimum-minimum wage.
Don't worry about that.

09:58.808 --> 10:01.978
Am I too much of a Coral Gables
princess to work at a shelter?

10:02.144 --> 10:03.938
"A," I didn't know
you were from Coral Gables.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.856
And "B," it's not the shelter,
man, it's the kids.

10:06.023 --> 10:08.276
Yeah, they're trans children
of the corn. I get it.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.569
No, you don't.
They'll Facebook you,

10:10.736 --> 10:12.405
they'll call you,
they'll text you all night,

10:12.571 --> 10:13.739
they won't respect
your boundaries,

10:13.906 --> 10:16.033
and they'll tell you shit
that you don't want to hear,

10:16.200 --> 10:18.119
'cause you're not
wired that way.

10:18.286 --> 10:21.247
I mean, unless you are,
then tell me.

10:21.414 --> 10:24.083
I need a job, Eddie.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.626
Something that won't
make me hate myself

10:25.793 --> 10:29.046
and has nothing
to do with art.

10:31.549 --> 10:32.758
Are you hungry?

10:32.925 --> 10:35.553
Yeah, I'm always hungry.
I'm, like, five pounds.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.888
All right, good. Let's get you a bag
of dicks to eat.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.584
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:06.751 --> 11:08.878
Uh, come in.
Come on in. Sorry.

11:09.045 --> 11:10.713
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.840
- How you doing
- Uh, good.

11:13.007 --> 11:15.801
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.303
Is, uh, Lynn here?

11:17.470 --> 11:18.929
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's out back.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.431
I'll show you.

11:20.598 --> 11:22.433
Okay.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.060
So, you doing well?

11:24.226 --> 11:27.021
Yeah. Am I crashing something?

11:27.188 --> 11:29.774
Nah, it should
be fine.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.108
Dom!

11:31.275 --> 11:32.693
Hey!

11:32.860 --> 11:35.905
- Hey.
- Missed you last night.

11:36.072 --> 11:39.450
Yeah, I wasn't sure if, uh...

11:39.617 --> 11:41.786
You know, I didn't think
I should come over.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.081
Well, you're here now.
You wanna join us for a soak?

11:45.247 --> 11:47.833
Plenty of room.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.252
You sure you don't mind?

11:50.419 --> 11:52.254
Wouldn't have asked you
if I did.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.595
Okay.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.975
Lynn saw me in a production
of <i>Beach Blanket Babylon,</i>

12:05.142 --> 12:08.187
back in the day, back when
it was at the Tivoli.

12:08.354 --> 12:10.314
Matthew was
a featured dancer.

12:10.481 --> 12:12.274
Ha. Yes, yes.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.276
We went out
for a drink, afterwards.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.278
Told him I wanted
to be an actor,

12:16.445 --> 12:20.116
and he very sweetly helped me
set up a showcase.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.201
I didn't know you were into
theatre producing, Lynn.

12:22.368 --> 12:24.370
Hm...

12:24.537 --> 12:26.455
What was the play again?

12:26.622 --> 12:28.999
<i>Angels.</i>
At the Rhino, remember?

12:29.166 --> 12:31.168
I was the worst Joe Pitt
you ever saw.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.087
No, you were
very compelling.

12:33.254 --> 12:35.840
- Bullshit.
- You were!

12:36.006 --> 12:39.301
- Thank you. Yeah, okay.
- I am a little dehydrated.

12:39.468 --> 12:40.970
Does anyone
want anything?

12:41.137 --> 12:44.515
Uh, there's a nice rosé
in the fridge.

12:44.682 --> 12:46.100
Okay.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.874
Oh, God. All these people
posting about Esta Noche.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.168
They're so right.
San Francisco is so over.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.627
Oh, relax.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.296
Come on.
You went there once, okay?

13:15.463 --> 13:17.339
And I love it, too,
but it's a shit-hole, okay?

13:17.506 --> 13:19.300
Just admit that the real reason
you're making us go

13:19.467 --> 13:21.886
- is to prove something to Richie.
- Fine. Okay, yes.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.263
It would be
a nice gesture to...

13:24.430 --> 13:26.098
to show him that
we can still be friends,

13:26.265 --> 13:27.892
that we've evolved enough to...

13:28.058 --> 13:30.060
- Are those veggie?
- Yeah.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.645
Thank you.

13:34.190 --> 13:35.274
Hey, um...

13:35.441 --> 13:36.984
What do you think about me
getting a job

13:37.151 --> 13:40.362
at a homeless shelter
for at-risk gay kids?

13:40.529 --> 13:42.865
What?

13:44.241 --> 13:46.368
I don't know.
Are you qualified for that?

13:46.535 --> 13:48.454
Oh, okay. My friend Eddie
got me an interview,

13:48.621 --> 13:51.123
so haters can hate,
and doubters can doubt.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.750
Oh, my God, I love
that Eddie-bear.

13:52.917 --> 13:54.502
He's so fun and campy.
It's like having

13:54.668 --> 13:56.128
your own personal
Mrs. Madrigal.

13:56.295 --> 13:57.796
Hey, who was
that text from?

13:59.924 --> 14:01.967
Kevin. Why?

14:05.930 --> 14:07.765
Coming back.

14:08.349 --> 14:11.435
- Oh!
- Thanks, Daddy.

14:11.602 --> 14:12.770
Excuse me?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.813
Dom, be nice.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.651
You know, for me,
it's a...

14:18.817 --> 14:21.320
it's a compliment.

14:21.487 --> 14:24.031
Well, for me, from you,
it's a trigger.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.622
So don't call me that again.

14:47.263 --> 14:49.181
- Yes.
- You both topped

14:49.348 --> 14:50.724
- hot Matthew from rugby?
- Lower your voice.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.810
Wait, hot Matthew from rugby
is a power bottom?

14:52.977 --> 14:54.436
Yes, he's one of you.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.189
Well, actually, I'm coming
into my own as a power top,

14:57.356 --> 14:58.482
- if you want to know.
- Really

14:58.649 --> 15:00.651
Yeah.
So, um...

15:00.818 --> 15:02.444
how endowed
is the young man?

15:02.611 --> 15:05.531
- Size queen.
- I'm curious. I want to know.

15:05.698 --> 15:06.949
- Length, average.
- Okay.

15:07.116 --> 15:10.452
- Girth, well above.
- Well, all right. Good for you.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.371
- Go Lynn.
- It's all Lynn.

15:12.538 --> 15:14.999
He invited Matthew.
I just happened to drop by.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.918
- Oh, was that weird?
- Little bit.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.837
The whole night
was weird.

15:20.004 --> 15:21.672
I don't know.
It's like...

15:21.839 --> 15:23.382
I'm still figuring out
this whole Lynn thing.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.884
- Oh, shit. Shit.
- What?

15:27.553 --> 15:29.346
- Is that?
- Yes. Block me.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.056
Come here.
Block me, block me.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.851
- Is that...
- Yeah.

15:34.018 --> 15:35.561
Is that the boyfriend?

15:43.402 --> 15:46.614
Paddy, let's just...
let's just back up.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.032
- Come on.
- Yeah.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.825
Come on.

16:00.461 --> 16:01.587
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.672
Right now?

16:03.839 --> 16:04.882
Uh-huh.

16:11.805 --> 16:12.890
Yo.

16:14.058 --> 16:15.559
What's up?
What's happened?

16:15.726 --> 16:18.812
I saw... Fuck.
Fuck me.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.067
At the farmer's market.
I was there. I, uh...

16:23.233 --> 16:24.735
I saw you with Jon.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.446
Okay.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.281
And you didn't
want to say hello?

16:29.448 --> 16:31.200
Are you totally
fucking insane?

16:31.367 --> 16:32.701
Calm down, Patrick.
It's all right.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.662
No, this is so
not all right.

16:36.538 --> 16:37.623
Listen, I...

16:37.790 --> 16:39.875
I get a text from you
when you're with Jon...

16:40.042 --> 16:42.503
and my heart, it...
it swells, Kevin,

16:42.670 --> 16:44.421
because I think, "Wow, he's actually
thinking of me."

16:44.588 --> 16:45.673
I was.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.216
I am.

16:47.383 --> 16:48.842
- I am all the time.
- Okay, fine,

16:49.009 --> 16:50.552
but you're with Jon, right?

16:50.719 --> 16:52.429
I mean, your life
is with Jon.

16:52.596 --> 16:54.765
You wake up with him.
You go to bed with him.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.392
You talk to him
on the phone every night.

16:56.558 --> 16:59.436
And we can steal lunches,
and we can steal weekends,

16:59.603 --> 17:01.480
but at the end of the day,
we're stealing from your life

17:01.647 --> 17:03.774
with Jon. And I...

17:03.941 --> 17:05.734
I want to be the kind
of person that can handle that,

17:05.901 --> 17:08.404
but I just... I can't.
I can't do it anymore.

17:08.570 --> 17:09.988
Because...

17:10.155 --> 17:11.657
Because you saw us
at the farmer's market?

17:11.824 --> 17:13.659
Yes!
And because...

17:15.452 --> 17:17.663
Every day,
more and more I'm...

17:17.830 --> 17:19.289
I'm building
this life for us,

17:19.456 --> 17:21.709
this future
in my head,

17:21.875 --> 17:23.794
us together,
and it's impossible.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.130
This is gonna end with Jon hurt,
or you and I hating each other,

17:26.255 --> 17:27.381
so let's just stop.
Let's just rewind...

17:27.506 --> 17:28.882
Stop talking.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.926
...go back to being flirty friends,
or whatever we were before.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.803
- I don't want to go back to that.
- And we can work on the app

17:32.928 --> 17:36.140
- and see each other at work.
- No. I will talk to Jon. Okay?

17:36.306 --> 17:38.684
- Today. I will talk to him, today.
- That's not what I--

17:38.851 --> 17:41.019
I will make this right.
And it will take time...

17:41.186 --> 17:43.480
to make him understand in a way
that doesn't wreck him.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.232
That will take time,
but I will do it.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.359
I know. I'm not asking you to--

17:47.526 --> 17:49.486
Well, you don't need to, Patrick.
You don't need to ask me.

17:49.653 --> 17:54.408
Because that life you are
building for us?

17:54.575 --> 17:56.368
I am too.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.790
I'm not losing it.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.838
Okay.

18:08.005 --> 18:11.425
If you're...

18:11.592 --> 18:12.885
Okay.

18:16.847 --> 18:19.141
Well, well, well.

18:19.308 --> 18:22.686
So, it's true.
The princess of Coral Gables

18:22.853 --> 18:24.646
somehow conned her way
into a job.

18:24.813 --> 18:25.939
Huh.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.026
I guess somebody told somebody
that I'm a good guy.

18:29.193 --> 18:31.195
Oh, well, if it was me,
you're welcome.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.157
Okay.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.621
You know, this first week, I'm not
even supposed to answer the phone,

18:40.788 --> 18:44.458
if it rings? Guess they're waiting
to see if I fuck up.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.043
Oh, they are.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.711
So, maybe don't.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.254
Okay?

18:52.716 --> 18:53.884
Hey, uh...

18:54.051 --> 18:56.220
What are you doing, tonight?

18:56.386 --> 18:57.971
Nothing.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.683
- Hey.
- Great timing.

19:01.850 --> 19:04.061
- Lock that behind you, will you?
- Sure.

19:04.228 --> 19:08.023
Let me get these in the case,
then we can go.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.650
No rush.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.863
Matthew's fun.

19:15.030 --> 19:18.075
Yeah.
He's a good egg, right?

19:19.910 --> 19:23.539
Should we ask him to meet us
at Esta Noche?

19:23.705 --> 19:26.166
He works nights, usually.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.044
Oh, maybe he can swing by
the house after work?

19:29.211 --> 19:32.548
I'm not really in the mood
for that. Are you?

19:32.714 --> 19:36.093
If I said I was, that I really
wanted to invite Matthew over,

19:36.260 --> 19:37.302
would it matter?

19:37.469 --> 19:40.639
Well, Dom, if...

19:40.806 --> 19:42.766
Invite him
if you want to.

19:45.769 --> 19:49.565
Everything we do
is a negotiation, Lynn.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.316
Everything's so...

19:51.483 --> 19:54.987
careful and--
and-- and... measured.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.780
It's like...

19:56.947 --> 19:58.699
you're withholding.

19:58.866 --> 20:01.994
It's like you're not sure
how much to invest in me...

20:02.160 --> 20:04.162
or us.

20:04.329 --> 20:07.958
- Is that what it feels like?
- Yeah. It does.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.837
And it makes me wonder
what am I to you.

20:12.004 --> 20:15.132
Am I Matthew?
Am I more than that? Less?

20:16.884 --> 20:18.635
Matthew's a friend.

20:18.802 --> 20:21.972
Yeah. I got that,
loud and clear.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.433
Where do I sit
in the pantheon?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.810
I told you when we started...

20:26.977 --> 20:28.896
...I've only got
so much to give.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.066
Because it all went to Brian.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.819
No. Not all,

20:35.986 --> 20:38.655
but he needed a lot.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.326
So, yes,
now I have my limits.

20:43.744 --> 20:44.828
You're not Matthew.

20:44.995 --> 20:46.580
But...

20:46.747 --> 20:51.209
what I had with Brian,
I won't have with anyone else,

20:51.376 --> 20:53.837
even if I wanted to.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.505
Too much life.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.549
But you could...

20:57.716 --> 21:00.010
if you wanted to.

21:00.177 --> 21:04.097
Your place at Russian River
is incredible,

21:04.264 --> 21:07.517
but it's also, like--
not a shrine, but...

21:07.684 --> 21:09.895
No, it is...

21:10.062 --> 21:12.689
to my and Brian's life,

21:12.856 --> 21:14.733
and I like that.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.028
So, I should...

21:18.195 --> 21:20.572
What? I should just
box it all up?

21:20.739 --> 21:23.283
Of course not. We'd just...
we'd have something else.

21:25.953 --> 21:28.497
You really...

21:28.664 --> 21:30.999
won't let yourself
be surprised?

21:33.961 --> 21:36.254
I want you
to have everything--

21:36.421 --> 21:37.756
your restaurant,

21:37.923 --> 21:40.884
what I had with Brian--
20 years with an incredible man.

21:41.051 --> 21:43.720
And God willing,
when you find that man,

21:43.887 --> 21:46.181
I hope it's more than 20 years.
I hope it's for the rest

21:46.348 --> 21:49.393
of your life. That's what I want
for you, Dom.

21:51.395 --> 21:53.146
When I find that man.

21:57.693 --> 21:59.444
What we're doing right now...

22:01.697 --> 22:02.864
it's all I got,

22:03.031 --> 22:06.159
and I've never
lied to you.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.453
And...

22:08.620 --> 22:11.164
If that's enough?
Then that's great.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.750
- If it's not...
- No, it's not.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.301
And it shouldn't be for you.

22:24.928 --> 22:27.597
Even if it's not with me,
you shouldn't...

22:27.764 --> 22:31.143
be... done, Lynn.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.454
- You like it?
- Yeah, dude. I do.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.790
- Hey, Paddy, what's up, buddy?
- Hey, guys.

22:53.957 --> 22:57.252
Oh, Patrick, this is Brady.
Brady, this is Patrick.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.545
Hey, man.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.088
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.757
We were just getting
to know each other.

23:01.923 --> 23:04.801
Not me. Just getting beers
for Dom and I. Goodbye.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.845
So, what do
you two girls do?

23:07.012 --> 23:10.265
- I cut hair.
- I work at <i>The Weekly.</i>

23:10.432 --> 23:13.894
Classifieds. I also
write about gay stuff.

23:14.061 --> 23:17.731
Oh, a queer Jimmy Olsen!
See, now that I love.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.067
How did you guys
meet, anyway?

23:20.233 --> 23:23.361
- He came in for a haircut.
- Stayed for the hot barber.

23:23.528 --> 23:25.030
Oh, I got an article
you could write about

23:25.197 --> 23:27.157
gringo-chasing in the community.

23:27.324 --> 23:30.160
Yeah, right after my
"Gays who are gaycist" article.

23:30.327 --> 23:32.621
Oh, really?

23:32.788 --> 23:35.040
All right, I like you.

23:35.207 --> 23:37.250
Can we just
get out of here?

23:37.417 --> 23:40.796
You wanna ditch our friends
before Peaches Christ goes on?

23:40.962 --> 23:42.631
What's going on?

23:44.091 --> 23:45.884
I'll tell you at home.

23:46.051 --> 23:49.471
It's, uh, Lynn stuff.

23:49.638 --> 23:53.266
I thought I could
push through, but...

23:53.433 --> 23:54.726
Oh, fuck. Okay.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.353
All right, let's go.
Let's go.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.154
You know, I wanna do that--
your Kickstarter idea.

24:06.321 --> 24:07.531
Let's do it, okay?

24:07.697 --> 24:09.324
You're talking about
the window or our movie?

24:09.491 --> 24:11.952
I saw this one video where
these two queens in Michigan

24:12.119 --> 24:14.079
open a Mexican bakery
with Kickstarter money.

24:14.246 --> 24:15.831
Look at that! You see that?
Dreams come true.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.415
Told you.

24:17.582 --> 24:18.959
Good.

24:19.126 --> 24:21.461
I need this, Dor.

24:21.628 --> 24:25.340
Fuck. I don't have
anything else.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.844
What the fuck happened?
What is going on?

24:29.010 --> 24:30.720
Don't say that
you have me, all right?

24:30.887 --> 24:32.389
You have me.

24:32.556 --> 24:34.432
And you have... you...

24:34.599 --> 24:37.185
Up till about 10 seconds ago,
I was gonna say you have Lynn, but...

24:37.352 --> 24:39.729
Well, I didn't.
I didn't ever have him.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.064
So...

24:42.274 --> 24:44.276
Oh, you have me.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.571
Thank fucking God.

24:49.364 --> 24:50.949
So, are you writing
a scathing op-ed

24:51.116 --> 24:53.076
about the early demise
of Esta Noche?

24:53.243 --> 24:55.036
With secrets and insights
from a former door man?

24:55.203 --> 24:57.080
I bet you have stories.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.915
Uh, yeah.
We are covering it.

24:59.082 --> 25:01.418
I'm not writing
the article.

25:01.585 --> 25:04.171
I'm just here tonight
as a human being.

25:04.337 --> 25:05.755
So, I'm not
gonna be in the article?

25:05.922 --> 25:07.966
No.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.177
Uh, excuse me
for a second.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.095
- I'll watch your beer, man.
- All right.

25:17.434 --> 25:18.602
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:18.768 --> 25:19.895
How'd it go?

25:21.771 --> 25:22.939
How'd it go?

25:23.106 --> 25:24.441
Are you okay?

25:25.901 --> 25:27.277
I was there.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.572
I was about to tell him,
I-- I--

25:30.739 --> 25:32.824
I started to tell...

25:36.620 --> 25:38.246
Well, you didn't tell him
anything about us?

25:38.413 --> 25:40.373
Well, I... I couldn't.
He has no idea!

25:40.540 --> 25:41.958
He's moved his life
to be here with me.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.585
But you could have, you know?
'Cause now this means

25:43.752 --> 25:46.213
- that you and I, we--
- I know what it means.

25:49.633 --> 25:51.593
Why did you
even come here?

25:51.760 --> 25:53.970
I don't know.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.931
I was...

25:56.097 --> 25:58.725
I'm sorry. It was for you,
to be with you.
