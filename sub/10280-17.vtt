WEBVTT

00:06.107 --> 00:07.508
Prieviously on ER.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.210
I'm fine.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.212
Even so, I've scheduled
a meeting with Dr. Myers.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.313
It's mandatory.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.414
Wow.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.648
It was my great-grandmother's.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.251
LEWIS:
You're going to propose?

00:17.285 --> 00:19.520
That's it?
You bought out

00:19.553 --> 00:20.788
this whole place just for that?

00:20.821 --> 00:22.456
I found a sore
on his penis.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.791
I think it's syphilis.

00:23.824 --> 00:28.396
Any way we can keep it out
of my medical record?

00:28.429 --> 00:29.397
No, that is not the point.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.299
You might say 2.4 up front,

00:31.332 --> 00:35.536
but you're going to lose 20,000
primary care visits a year...

00:35.569 --> 00:37.071
MAN:
Thank you,
Dr. Weaver.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.307
For a potential loss
of over $10 million.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.675
MAN:
We have to make tough choices
this fiscal year...

00:41.709 --> 00:43.177
WEAVER:
Tough, yes, short-sighted, no.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.612
MAN:
Is there a motion to vote?

00:44.645 --> 00:46.380
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.
I'm not finished.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.748
I think we understand the issue.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.751
Lack of primary care
leaves thousands...

00:50.784 --> 00:52.220
MAN:
And your argument.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.555
These are human beings,
not statistics,

00:54.588 --> 00:57.225
and we are abandoning
an entire community.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.392
We get it.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.828
Thank you.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.197
Now, is there a motion
to vote in open session?

01:03.231 --> 01:04.364
Mr. Chairman...

01:04.397 --> 01:05.366
Motion.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.235
Second.

01:07.268 --> 01:10.571
All right, all those in favor of
closing the Erie Street Clinic.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.209
Those opposed
to the closing?

01:20.714 --> 01:23.151
The nays have it.

01:23.151 --> 01:23.851
15-minute recess.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.319
( bangs gavel )

01:25.353 --> 01:27.855
BRIGHT:
Nice work, Kerry.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.257
Is it always this close?

01:29.290 --> 01:30.691
You have the gift
of persuasion.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.326
Well, pugnacity is more like it.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.295
And an understanding
of what motivates people,

01:34.328 --> 01:36.397
and that's the secret
to being a good politician.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.698
I'm out of my league there.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.633
Nonsense, it wouldn't
surprise me

01:39.667 --> 01:41.602
if you were Surgeon
General someday.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.737
Kristy?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.573
Meet the future
Surgeon General

01:45.606 --> 01:47.608
and savior of the
Erie Street Clinic.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.642
Hello, Doctor.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.510
He's kidding.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.778
He never kids.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.513
Ah, Kerry, you have
another minute?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.615
Ah, sure.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.417
Parks and Rec
has been pushed to 11:00

01:56.450 --> 01:57.651
and Bamberger called again

01:57.685 --> 01:59.187
about the Gay
Marriage Amendment.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.788
Tell him I'm sympathetic,

02:00.821 --> 02:03.591
but it will never pass, and I'm
not going to torpedo the bill.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.494
Maybe we should get you
on that one.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.729
Might actually stand a chance.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.698
What do you mean?

02:10.731 --> 02:14.302
You're a problem-solver,
Kerry.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.769
A pragmatist.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.806
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate that.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.741
Thank you.

02:20.774 --> 02:24.512
That's why I hate to implore you
for another personal favor,

02:24.545 --> 02:29.583
but, oh, I frankly don't
know what else to do.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.319
You were very considerate

02:31.352 --> 02:33.921
in treating my
off-the-record condition.

02:33.954 --> 02:37.391
Did the lesion not heal?

02:37.425 --> 02:41.329
No, it did, but... I'm in a
relationship with someone,

02:41.362 --> 02:42.730
someone who works for me.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.966
I'm single,
we're in love,

02:45.999 --> 02:51.672
but workplace affairs, well,
I don't need the attention.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.541
And uh, she's symptomatic?

02:53.574 --> 02:55.643
I was hoping you could
provide treatment

02:55.676 --> 02:57.445
with the same level
of discretion.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.746
You should send her
to any free clinic.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.281
They're all confidential.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.815
Just a simple shot
of penicillin, right?

03:01.849 --> 03:05.886
Treatment without generating a
medical record is malpractice.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.689
But you've done it before.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.825
And I shouldn't have.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.696
Okay, okay, I think
I understand.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.636
I'm sorry, I mean, you know,
I, I, I could lose my license.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.004
Don't be sorry.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.906
You're a woman
of principle.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.675
How can I not
respect that?

03:27.708 --> 03:28.976
Forget I asked.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.878
And congratulations again.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.614
You did some real
good today, Kerry.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.516
Thank you.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.919
Of course, there
are no guarantees

03:38.952 --> 03:40.954
for next year's budget
at your hospital.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.391
What?

03:43.424 --> 03:47.661
There's an afternoon vote on
eliminating emergency services.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.497
At County General?

03:49.530 --> 03:52.300
You mean closing the ER?

03:52.333 --> 03:55.869
I need you, Kerry.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.759 --> 04:54.762
Is your jalopy
still in the shop?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.564
It's a Jeep.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.065
Oh, a Jeep.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.368
A Jeep.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.672
You hardly touched
your breakfast.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.741
Yeah, I don't like to eat much
before a shift.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.043
All that blood and guts,
you know?

05:10.077 --> 05:12.646
Don't remind me.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.649
I had a feeling

05:15.683 --> 05:17.751
there was some agenda
this morning,

05:17.785 --> 05:19.887
but you've been
very mysterious.

05:19.920 --> 05:25.092
Just wanted to check in,
see how you were.

05:25.125 --> 05:29.663
And I wanted to give this back
to you for the time being.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.798
She said no?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.966
I didn't ask.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.034
Did something happen?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.636
No, just felt kinda rushed.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.605
What did she do?

05:37.638 --> 05:39.407
Nothing.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.874
Doesn't even know.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.543
I don't think she knows.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.712
Maybe she knows.
I don't know.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.779
I'm sorry, Johnny.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.448
I thought you'd be relieved.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.982
That you're unhappy?

05:49.016 --> 05:53.053
I got the impression that you
never really... cared for her.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.157
( sighs )

05:57.190 --> 05:58.859
I've spent so many years

05:58.892 --> 06:01.895
trying to get you to do
what I think is best for you.

06:01.929 --> 06:06.834
You're past
having me badger you
about your choices.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.137
This is yours.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.907
Give it or don't,
to whomever you choose.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.879
Why?
Oh, I'm thinking
Emergency Medicine.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.614
Here?
Better than Iraq.

06:20.648 --> 06:21.882
Hey, that is not it.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.584
Don't you still owe four years?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.886
Well, I can roll the time
to after my residency.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.087
Afraid to fight,
all right.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.989
Hey, anytime, any place,
old man.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.891
I can smell fear a mile away.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.092
Answer the phone, Frank.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.827
ER.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.629
You know, the holiday
is called Saint Patrick's Day,

06:35.663 --> 06:36.830
not Saint Patrick's week.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.632
You got something
against the Irish?

06:38.666 --> 06:41.769
The giant shamrock in triage
started drinking 72 hours ago...

06:41.802 --> 06:43.671
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Dr. Weaver.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.839
Frank?
Oh, she'll be back
in a few minutes.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.040
Have a seat over there.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.509
Why do they always ask me?

06:48.542 --> 06:50.077
Do I look like
customer service lady?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.812
He's cute.
He's a zygote.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.881
Any more blind dates?
Never again.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.016
But we're going
to Las Vegas tonight.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.551
Who's we?

06:57.585 --> 07:00.688
Me and Chen.
And 50 other county employees.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.556
So, how's it going with you?

07:02.590 --> 07:05.192
Rule out MI,
waiting on a second triponin.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.127
No, I meant in general.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.529
Any, uh, news?

07:08.562 --> 07:09.663
No.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.131
Did you need that?

07:11.164 --> 07:13.100
Um... oh, I thought
it was a different patient.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.736
So, how are you and Carter?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.004
Good, I guess.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.171
Kind of.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.940
He's been acting
a little weird.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.175
Well, it's been rough
for the both of you lately.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.878
Yeah, I think we're getting
back to normal, though.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.647
Dr. Lewis,
he's seizing again.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.883
Another four of lorazepam
and load a gram of dilantin.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.218
Abby, clear CT on this one.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.152
Blown pupil?

07:32.185 --> 07:33.921
Sub-conj hemorrhage.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.089
No ID. Too young for
a driver's license, no purse.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.625
This the assault?

07:37.658 --> 07:39.192
LOC in Union Station,
probably a street kid.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.694
Not with those boots.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.195
Expensive jacket, too.
Maybe she shoplifts.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.897
She came in with that girl?

07:43.931 --> 07:45.566
No, different run.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.536
Dr. Kovac?
Chest is clear,
belly's soft.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.603
Looks like isolated head
and facial trauma.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.971
What happened?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.073
Let's get a C-spine,
chest, and pelvis.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.608
Dr. Kovac?
You got this?

07:54.642 --> 07:56.176
Yep. Trauma panel.
Urine icon. Dip a UA.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.210
I'm sorry, I forgot.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.579
Three times.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.013
That's three
missed appointments.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.615
Yeah, I, I have
a bad memory.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.916
Look, your department
required psychotherapy,

08:02.950 --> 08:03.917
but I have to report to mine.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.085
I don't want to be a heavy.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.086
In fact,
I want to help you.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.254
Prepare for disappointment.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.022
I have extended
office hours tonight.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.024
I'm free from 7:00 to 8:00.
Can you make that?

08:11.058 --> 08:13.561
I really don't
see the point.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.295
You don't have to see the point.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.129
Just show up.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.931
Just show up?

08:17.965 --> 08:20.801
That's all I've been doing:
showing up.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.835
Time goes by faster at work.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.003
Pulse ox 99.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.638
DTR's two-plus
at the knee.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.206
Gold card.
"Joanna Banks."
Is that her?

08:26.239 --> 08:27.240
Shift work. Treat-and-street
a few lost souls.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.076
I doubt it.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.580
You're with them
when they're most vulnerable.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.581
Is that bile?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.847
That's 17 Jello shots.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.283
All right, let's prep
for lavage.

08:36.316 --> 08:40.921
When they're naked, weak,
hurt...

08:40.953 --> 08:43.256
you touch them,
look at their bodies.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.992
See them more closely

08:45.025 --> 08:47.828
than their families,
their lovers,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.797
but it's mechanical.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.765
You know, temporary.

08:51.799 --> 08:55.068
You fix them up
or you watch them die.

08:55.102 --> 08:59.607
Either way, it ends,
and you... move on.

08:59.607 --> 09:05.112
No next time, no strings,
no real connections.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.917
Maybe that's why I stay.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.655
You waiting on incoming?

09:14.688 --> 09:16.189
What?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.091
Did you sign up for incoming?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.893
Coffee.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.294
Cigarette break?

09:23.263 --> 09:25.065
Do you want some?

09:25.098 --> 09:26.634
What?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.035
Coffee?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.336
No, thanks.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.106
You're not turning into
a health nut on me, huh?

09:33.140 --> 09:37.110
No. Waiting for an old lady
that fell of her treadmill.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.046
Okay.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.715
CORDAY:
Do you remember what happened?

09:47.220 --> 09:48.956
Can I call your parents?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.126
Um, I don't live at home.

09:54.394 --> 09:57.097
Where do you live?

10:00.167 --> 10:04.171
Molly, I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

10:04.204 --> 10:08.141
Uh... they call it
a, a boot camp

10:08.175 --> 10:11.144
for kids who can't get along
with their parents.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.747
So they discipline you.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.716
Does this look like discipline?

10:15.749 --> 10:18.852
A camp counselor
did this to you?

10:18.886 --> 10:21.388
I heard they raped a girl.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.023
Okay.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.825
Haleh...

10:24.858 --> 10:28.095
perhaps Molly should be speaking
with a police officer.

10:28.128 --> 10:32.432
I'm sure your mother would like
to know that you're here.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.067
That you're safe.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.269
Who do you think sent me there
in the first place?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.405
ABBY:
Any family?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.140
She said
she has a husband, Charles.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.209
WOMAN:
And what else
did I say about him?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.310
That he's useless.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.845
Exactly. Forget him.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.780
Listen, you chowderhead,
it's a stolen card.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.949
How am I supposed to know
her mother's maiden name?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.151
Hey, John, what are you doing
boarding four ICU players

10:51.184 --> 10:52.219
and eight med-surg
admissions?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.320
Susan's driving.
Talk to her.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.855
Dr. Weaver?
What?

10:54.888 --> 10:56.824
Keith Mitchell. I have
an appointment to see you.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.458
Yeah, we don't make
appointments in the ER.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.193
Report your complaint
to the triagers.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.763
I believe special arrangements
were made by Alderman Bright.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.071
Jonathan has nothing
but wonderful things
to say about you.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.876
How long have you been
in his office?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.978
Ah, I started
junior year,
spring quarter,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.146
so about two years.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.748
Now, I get
grad school credit

11:20.748 --> 11:22.215
and on-the-job
training.

11:22.249 --> 11:26.053
He's a great mentor, very
generous with his time.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.288
Oh, uh, this goes
in the buttocks.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.362
I'm surprised that you waited
so long to be treated.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.464
I didn't notice the sore.
Jonathan did.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.233
When?

11:40.267 --> 11:42.135
Two nights ago.
I was so embarrassed.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.237
I just hope I didn't
give it to him.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.839
He didn't have it?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.140
Ah, no.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.177
I was pretty crazy
in my college days.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.145
I mean, we're completely
monogamous now,

11:52.179 --> 11:54.514
but I have to say
he was really cool about it.

11:54.547 --> 11:58.185
Most people wouldn't be
so understanding.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.188
All done.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.156
We all have
our past, right?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.460
MAN:
I told you
not to work out so much.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.297
So I can sit around
and watch the soaps all day?

12:10.330 --> 12:12.199
Any other symptoms,
Mrs. Sanbery?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.001
Yes, my hair is falling out.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.168
But I blame that on him.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.303
She just kidding.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.370
The hell I am.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.206
Have you checked
the fingernails?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.073
Yeah, I'm getting to that.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.374
What?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.310
These marks, these lines?
What marks?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.812
These are called Meese lines.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.246
What kind of work did you do?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.848
Supervisor at a
wood processing plant.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.116
Did they use arsenic?

12:29.149 --> 12:30.283
They tested us for it
all the time.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.319
That can't be it.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.222
Okay, let's get
Mrs. Sanbery's blood
and urine reports from OSHA.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.356
I will be right back.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.825
Take him with you.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.226
MAN:
Ruthy, just relax.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.994
Wonders of marital bliss, huh?

12:41.028 --> 12:42.262
I don't know who's worse.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.131
Her for being such
a pain in the ass,

12:44.164 --> 12:45.265
or him for being
so pathetic.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.167
Cuts both ways, I guess.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.003
Hey, my bike girl trauma
may have a diminished
foot pulse.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.939
Check Dopplers.
I'll be there in a minute.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.340
Um, Mrs. Banks.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.207
Yes?

12:54.241 --> 12:55.843
I'm Dr. Corday.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.510
I'm the surgeon
treating your daughter.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.879
She'll need surgery?

12:58.912 --> 13:00.247
No, no...

13:00.280 --> 13:03.884
I'm surprised the camp
actually called you.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.219
Why wouldn't they?

13:06.253 --> 13:09.389
Well, they assaulted
your daughter.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.059
Is that what she told you?

13:12.092 --> 13:14.561
She ran off
on the second day.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.163
They didn't touch her.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.865
Somebody did.

13:17.898 --> 13:21.101
With Molly, there's
all kinds of explanations.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.170
What makes you certain
it's not the camp?

13:23.203 --> 13:25.172
MRS. BANKS:
Because she says it is.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.508
Trashing my house
with a baseball bat.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.043
Shoplifting.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.979
Drinking, drug use.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.981
Unwanted pregnancy.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.383
Do I need to go on?

13:36.416 --> 13:38.886
( pager beeping )

13:38.919 --> 13:41.955
I need to call my office.

13:41.989 --> 13:46.026
Maybe you can talk to her
when you're finished.

13:46.059 --> 13:50.430
I haven't been able to talk
to her in three years.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.900
WEAVER:
Actually threw you
across the room?

13:52.933 --> 13:56.036
In a bar fight,
not a tossing.

13:56.069 --> 13:56.904
Big difference.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.571
Congratulations, Kerry.

13:58.605 --> 14:02.910
Whatever you're doing down at
City Hall seems to be working.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.577
Well, it was
a close vote.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.413
But without a single cut.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.249
What?
The hospital budget.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.051
We were vulnerable to a 20% cut,

14:11.084 --> 14:13.921
but it sailed through committee
less than an hour ago.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.422
MAN:
They say he drove out
the snakes.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.489
Who?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.391
Saint Patrick.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.394
Well, I'd like to see you and
Robert in my office at 5:00.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.231
Is there a problem?

14:24.264 --> 14:26.366
Just a little
administrative
housekeeping.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.435
We should burn
through it quickly.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.338
Dr. Weaver,
Dr. Lewis needs you.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.474
What kid?

14:34.507 --> 14:35.943
That kid.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.477
He was looking for you,
waiting in chairs.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.645
A paramedic brought him in.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.280
125 of solumedrol,

14:40.313 --> 14:41.381
50 of benadryl.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.615
Stand by
with an epi drip.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.217
Hey, Kerry,
do you know this kid?

14:44.251 --> 14:45.953
What happened?

14:45.953 --> 14:47.320
Passed out at Doc Magoo's.
Tight wheezes and hives,

14:47.354 --> 14:48.655
barely any
breath sounds.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.157
You don't
happen to know

14:50.190 --> 14:52.192
if he has any food
allergies, do you?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.961
No, I don't.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.395
He was looking for you.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.297
Sats are dropping, 93.
Pulse: 120.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.499
Cords are too edematous.
20 of etomidate,

14:59.532 --> 15:00.633
100 of sux.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.035
Prep a crike tray.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.236
Fiber-optic with a 7-0 tube.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.171
Okay, one more look.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.338
You're wasting time.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.007
Kerry, you need
to let the drugs work.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.608
He needs intubation
on the next attempt.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.676
So you do know him.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.144
He could be allergic
to anything.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.679
An insect bite
or have a carcinoid.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.414
He's got an ID
from City Hall.

15:14.447 --> 15:18.151
Okay, do a jaw thrust and keep
a good seal when you bag him.

15:18.185 --> 15:22.089
You know, I did get some papers
from Health and Human Services.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.457
This man maybe dropped them off.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.694
Okay, suction
and light source on high.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.596
Let's go.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.533
This is an emergency.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.302
Listen, you tell him
that one of his staffers

15:35.335 --> 15:38.671
is in the ER with
a severe allergic reaction.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.241
Tell him to call me
as soon as he can.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.579
You were right.
He does work at City Hall.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.315
Mm, Alderman
Bright's office?

15:48.348 --> 15:49.549
Yeah, how did you know?

15:49.582 --> 15:51.084
Well, there's
no insect bite,

15:51.118 --> 15:53.086
but there's a chancre
on his penis.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.487
Kerry...

15:54.521 --> 15:56.589
That's a bit of a leap,
don't you think?

15:56.623 --> 15:57.757
The Alderman
walked out of here

15:57.790 --> 15:59.226
with untreated
syphilis.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.760
We don't know
that it was untreated.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.729
And now one of his young
staffers comes back...

16:02.762 --> 16:04.531
All right, we certainly
don't know

16:04.564 --> 16:06.133
that the Alderman
is in the habit

16:06.166 --> 16:07.734
of sexual harassment,
much less gay.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.469
The kid is in
anaphylactic shock.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.471
Either it's a sudden food
allergy or drug.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.205
My guess is penicillin.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.073
Not necessarily.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.474
I mean, it, it could be

16:14.507 --> 16:16.443
idiopathic histamine release
or vasculitis...

16:16.476 --> 16:17.510
He's triggering
the vent.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.778
Any spontaneous
eye opening?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.513
Not yet.

16:20.547 --> 16:21.748
Okay, call immunology
for skin testing.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.183
Have them include
penicillin

16:23.216 --> 16:24.417
and get me as soon
as he wakes up.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.627
What's his F.I. O2?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.229
Fifty percent.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.439
Sounds like
upper airway secretions.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.175
I think he's
just a little wheezy.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.277
Why don't you get
a suction catheter.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.080
He might have a mucus plug
we need to clear out.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.481
He's satting at 98%...

16:54.514 --> 16:55.748
I want to optimize
his oxygenation.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.517
Just get it.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.425
Keith?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.196
Keith?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.800
Can you hear me?

17:17.404 --> 17:18.570
Keith.

17:21.473 --> 17:24.844
Keith, there's a tube
in your throat

17:24.877 --> 17:26.378
to help you breathe.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.581
You had a severe
allergic reaction,

17:28.615 --> 17:31.351
probably to the penicillin,

17:31.384 --> 17:35.255
but everything
is okay now, all right?

17:35.288 --> 17:39.226
We'll take out the tube soon,
you'll be able to speak

17:39.259 --> 17:43.563
and the other doctors will
have some questions for you.

17:43.596 --> 17:47.134
They've examined you, so
they know you have syphilis

17:47.167 --> 17:50.570
and they'll be able to determine
an allergy to penicillin.

17:50.603 --> 17:57.610
But Jonathan cannot
have sent you here.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.446
To me.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.882
You know what that means.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.553
We have to protect him.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.657
We can't give anyone
reason to speculate,

18:10.690 --> 18:13.226
or they might
even target Jonathan

18:13.260 --> 18:16.363
as the source
of the infection.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.666
Listen carefully, Keith.

18:19.699 --> 18:23.436
People have been known
to borrow prescriptions

18:23.470 --> 18:28.308
from friends without
ever seeing a doctor.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.643
They think they know
what they have,

18:30.677 --> 18:31.911
and how to treat it,

18:31.944 --> 18:36.349
so they take care of it
on their own.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.185
Do you understand?

18:42.355 --> 18:44.324
Good.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.694
Dr. Carter.
Dealership called.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.796
You need brake pads.
It'll be ready at 5:00.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.632
Can you get rabies
from fish?

18:52.665 --> 18:54.201
No.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.202
You're sure?

18:55.202 --> 18:56.603
I'm pretty sure.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.737
Well, what do you
make of this?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.206
Big-ass pike bit me

18:59.206 --> 19:00.640
when I was trying
to get it off the line.

19:00.673 --> 19:01.841
Looks infected.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.610
That's it?

19:03.643 --> 19:06.213
Call me if you
start growing gills.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.580
Doctor.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.249
OSHA results.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.285
The arsenic levels in
Mrs. Sanbery's urine samples

19:12.319 --> 19:15.222
for the past three years
have been undetectable.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.657
And today's results?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.559
Over 200 mikes per liter.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.693
( whistles )

19:20.727 --> 19:23.663
Maybe she got down
about being home.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.298
Suicide attempt?

19:25.332 --> 19:26.699
I don't know.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.436
Happens to some retirees.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.771
Either that, or someone's
trying to kill her.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.573
Find out if she's
been depressed.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.607
Take it from there.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.608
Okay.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.643
What's that?

19:36.676 --> 19:37.644
What?

19:37.677 --> 19:38.678
On your back.

19:41.581 --> 19:42.982
It's the patch.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.786
For... birth control?

19:46.819 --> 19:48.421
No, for smoking.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.889
You quit smoking?

19:49.922 --> 19:52.292
Four days ago, yes,
thanks for noticing.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.826
Thanks for sharing.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.295
Last week I had to bring

19:55.328 --> 19:56.796
a throat cancer
patient outside

19:56.829 --> 19:59.299
so she could smoke
through her trach hole

19:59.332 --> 20:01.834
and I decided this
has got to stop.

20:01.868 --> 20:02.969
Really?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.839
Uh, there's some bronchospasm.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.642
Add a unit dose of atrovent
to his next treatment.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.843
I think he's waking up.

20:10.877 --> 20:11.844
Should I call Lewis?

20:11.878 --> 20:12.945
It's her patient.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.714
MOLLY:
Get her
out of here!

20:14.747 --> 20:16.649
Get her out!
Get her out of here!

20:16.683 --> 20:18.418
CORDAY:
Lie back or you'll
hurt yourself.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.386
I told you not to call her.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.587
Get out, you bitch!

20:20.620 --> 20:22.021
Molly, you need
to talk to your mother.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.023
About locking me up again?
About getting me raped?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.358
Do you need
pysch?

20:25.392 --> 20:26.959
She doesn't give
a crap about me.

20:26.993 --> 20:30.363
You told me we were going on
a camping trip, you lying slut!

20:30.397 --> 20:31.731
Okay,
two of Ativan.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.700
Make it four.
I could use a good buzz.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.901
Now, you listen to me!

20:34.934 --> 20:35.868
I want you to settle
down right now!

20:35.902 --> 20:37.837
Get her out of here.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.039
I'll ask your mother to leave
if you'll stop struggling.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.808
Molly,
the reason

20:41.841 --> 20:44.444
I put you in that program
is because I care about you.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.778
Liar!

20:45.812 --> 20:47.347
Okay, okay, hard restraints.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.715
Oh, God.
Liar!

20:48.748 --> 20:49.716
Where's
the Ativan?

20:49.749 --> 20:51.518
Liar! Liar!

20:51.551 --> 20:52.785
Liar! Liar!

20:52.819 --> 20:53.853
From the time she was
two years old

20:53.886 --> 20:55.488
she's been acting like this.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.923
I actually thought that
she would get over it.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.358
Okay, sit right here.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.827
And then keep
pressure on that.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.362
I know.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.931
They shocked four times
for v fib.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.434
Hold compressions.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.701
Asystole.

21:08.735 --> 21:09.569
Hate crime.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.703
Forget it.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.772
Gray matter and
brain stem failure.

21:12.805 --> 21:13.773
Call it.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.776
Time of death: 13:43.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.978
HARMS:
Some jerk shot him
three times

21:19.011 --> 21:20.813
because he wouldn't
get off the bus.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.482
Said it was only
for Americans.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.817
Morales is en route
with the shooter.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.686
Okay, Keith,

21:26.719 --> 21:29.589
we have a breathing treatment
for you to work on.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.890
( coughs )

21:30.923 --> 21:32.592
Okay, here you go.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.362
Deep breaths,
in and out.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.830
Pulse ox 99.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.366
Good.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.770
You had a severe allergic
reaction to something.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.572
Is there anything
you've eaten

21:45.605 --> 21:47.607
that you know
you're allergic to?

21:47.640 --> 21:48.841
Any new medications?

21:48.875 --> 21:51.043
Penicillin.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.712
Why are you taking penicillin?

21:54.481 --> 21:55.948
Syphilis.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.017
My ex-girlfriend called
and told me she had an outbreak,

21:58.050 --> 21:59.619
and I better take care of it.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.920
Did you know you're
allergic to penicillin?

22:00.953 --> 22:01.888
No.

22:01.921 --> 22:02.922
Did the doctor

22:02.955 --> 22:03.890
who gave it to you ask?

22:06.158 --> 22:07.760
I didn't see the doctor.

22:07.794 --> 22:08.928
My ex told me
that's what they gave her.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.497
I had a friend

22:10.530 --> 22:13.900
who had some left over
from a strep throat.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.745
( speaking Russian )

22:25.778 --> 22:28.415
We're still looking
for a Russian translator.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.917
When they cry,
the eardrum turns red

22:30.950 --> 22:32.852
and you can't rule out
an infection.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.722
Kovac, eye trauma girl's
losing visual acuity.

22:35.755 --> 22:36.789
She may need decompression.

22:36.823 --> 22:37.790
I'll be right there.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.993
( speaking Russian )

22:42.962 --> 22:44.831
Dr. Kovac,

22:44.864 --> 22:47.099
I was wondering if you'd write
a letter of recommendation

22:47.133 --> 22:48.701
for my Dean's file.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.036
I can't do that.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.471
What?

22:51.504 --> 22:52.605
Sorry.

22:52.639 --> 22:53.806
Did you give him
the message?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.074
Luka, wait.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.108
Corday needs help
with a canthotomy.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.910
Hold on.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.146
Tell him that I really need
to talk to him. It's important.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.781
Well, you have him
call me back.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.916
You're blowing off
your required therapy?

23:03.950 --> 23:04.784
No.

23:04.817 --> 23:05.885
We had an agreement.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.086
I never agreed
to anything.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.821
Well, you came
back here, didn't you?

23:08.855 --> 23:11.090
I told you it was
mandatory, didn't I?

23:11.123 --> 23:12.925
Excuse me, Luka.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.927
Hey, I don't need
to see a shrink.

23:16.863 --> 23:17.897
What's wrong?

23:17.930 --> 23:18.998
BP's down to 80.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.500
Might have vagalled
with the ABG.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.001
Something's wrong
with my stomach.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.570
Get his head down and
squeeze in two liters.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.004
Belly's rigid.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.639
Where's his last chest film?

23:26.673 --> 23:27.940
Why does it
hurt so much?

23:27.974 --> 23:29.542
Tachy at 120.

23:29.576 --> 23:30.910
Oh, God.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.178
Free air under
the diaphragm.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.846
What does that mean?

23:33.880 --> 23:35.915
You have a perforation
in your stomach or intestine.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.216
From the penicillin?

23:37.249 --> 23:40.186
No. Hang 100 Gent,
500 of Flagyl.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.154
Pressure's
down to 60.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.155
Keith?

23:43.189 --> 23:44.891
Keith, how you doing? Keith?

23:46.493 --> 23:47.994
How hard were you bagging him?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.929
The cords were
swollen shut.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.898
Which is why
you don't hyperventilate.

23:51.931 --> 23:52.965
Kerry, don't
blame this on her.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.133
Get Corday in here.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.035
20 of famotidine
IV piggyback.

23:56.068 --> 23:58.671
Sometimes small perforations
can heal spontaneously.

23:58.705 --> 23:59.939
Now, Abby.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.576
O2 15 liters by mask.

24:03.610 --> 24:04.577
Set me up
for a central line.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.545
Get me some
betadine.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.546
MOLLY:
Can't see.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.213
Why can't I see?

24:07.246 --> 24:08.715
CORDAY:
Hold still.

24:08.748 --> 24:09.716
Dr. Corday, Dr. Weaver
needs a consult.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.017
Retro-bulbar hematoma.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.752
It's compressing
the optic nerve.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.053
Am I going blind?

24:14.086 --> 24:15.021
Will someone
tell me what's wrong?

24:15.054 --> 24:16.656
You can't see because

24:16.689 --> 24:17.624
there's blood
collecting behind your eye.

24:17.657 --> 24:18.625
We have to drain it.

24:18.658 --> 24:19.859
How?
A tiny incision.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.193
Dr. Corday?
You have to give me a minute.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.562
You're going to cut
into my eyeball?

24:22.595 --> 24:24.063
Just the skin on the side.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.065
No, please, I don't
want you guys to do this.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.967
The longer we wait, the greater
the risk of blindness.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.135
Please don't do this, please.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.837
I really don't want you
to cut my eye.

24:30.870 --> 24:31.871
Molly, we have
no choice.

24:31.904 --> 24:32.805
Mom? Mom?

24:32.839 --> 24:33.606
1% with epi.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.074
I'm here.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.176
KOVAC:
Sometimes you see it
in their eyes.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.945
Mom...

24:38.978 --> 24:40.547
They're trusting
what you're saying.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.849
You're the doctor.
You know best.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.884
But I don't.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.886
I guess.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.788
And lie.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.925
Say the same things
to different people

24:52.959 --> 24:54.961
over and over again
until I can hardly

24:54.994 --> 24:58.898
make the words come
out of my mouth anymore.

24:58.931 --> 25:02.869
It's really hard
not to be disgusted...

25:02.902 --> 25:11.644
with yourself, with the system,
everyone you work with.

25:11.678 --> 25:15.214
Even with the people
you're supposed to help.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.685
All done.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.688
Dr. Corday,
we have a gastric rupture.

25:21.721 --> 25:22.789
Can you suture?

25:22.822 --> 25:23.890
Yeah, I got it.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.692
How many
fingers?

25:25.725 --> 25:26.659
Infuser is primed.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.160
I'm in. Hook me up.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.229
CORDAY:
He has a history of
peptic ulcer disease?

25:30.262 --> 25:32.665
Overinflation
from bag mask ventilation.

25:32.699 --> 25:33.833
He could have had
an underlying lesion.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.101
Fluid's in.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.335
Pressure's still
not coming up.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.704
CORDAY:
Dopamine
at ten mikes.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.805
Tell the OR
we're on our way up.

25:38.838 --> 25:39.839
Why was he being bagged?

25:39.872 --> 25:41.273
LEWIS:
Anaphylaxis.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.810
CORDAY:
Gram of Cefoxitin,
cover anaerobes.

25:43.843 --> 25:46.012
No, he's allergic to penicillin.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.146
Any family?

25:47.179 --> 25:48.981
Not that I could see.
Kerry?

25:49.015 --> 25:50.617
Sinus tach on monitor.

25:50.617 --> 25:51.618
Kerry.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.151
What?

25:52.184 --> 25:53.285
Any family?

25:53.319 --> 25:54.353
I don't know.
Ask Frank.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.622
CORDAY:
He's had steroids?

25:58.324 --> 26:01.293
So how long am I
in the hospital?

26:01.327 --> 26:02.795
A few days.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.196
You can go home

26:04.230 --> 26:06.265
as long as there's
no re-bleeding.

26:06.298 --> 26:09.702
Home, yeah, right.
My mom would rather I go blind.

26:09.736 --> 26:12.238
She was just here,
holding your hand.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.774
Yeah, holding my hand
for ten minutes

26:14.807 --> 26:16.275
doesn't fix ten years.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.811
Ten years of what?

26:18.845 --> 26:20.913
Of hating me.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.649
She hates me.

26:22.649 --> 26:25.652
That's not what I saw.

26:25.685 --> 26:29.288
Whatever.
I hate her, too.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.791
What I saw was
a scared little girl

26:31.824 --> 26:33.693
crying for her mother.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.662
And her mother came.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.299
She's never let me come home.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.200
Ask her.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.735
I can't.

26:42.769 --> 26:46.238
Getting beat up on
the street is better?

26:48.240 --> 26:49.676
Would you?

26:49.676 --> 26:51.678
What?

26:51.711 --> 26:54.113
Ask her.

26:56.916 --> 26:57.984
CORDAY:
The field's dry.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.185
He's septic.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.687
BJERKE:
Dopamine's up to 20 mikes.

27:00.687 --> 27:01.688
How much blood loss?

27:01.721 --> 27:02.822
Insignificant.

27:02.855 --> 27:03.923
What's the last crit?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.024
Thirty-six.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.425
Run of six.
100 of lidocaine,

27:06.458 --> 27:08.194
starting a drip
at two per minute.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.829
He needs crystalloid.

27:09.862 --> 27:13.733
Squeeze in two units of saline,
and hang Levophed.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.334
V tach!

27:15.367 --> 27:16.703
Crash cart!

27:16.736 --> 27:19.105
Charge to 200.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.940
No pulse.
Start compressions.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.775
Amp of epi.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.344
We're charged.

27:25.377 --> 27:26.946
Clear.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.349
No change.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.051
Charge to 300.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.886
Epi's on board.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.021
Charged again.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.289
Clear.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.457
PERRY:
V fib.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.959
CORDAY:
Damn it.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.795
360. He's a kid.
He should respond.

27:42.829 --> 27:46.465
Satinsky. Vasopressin
40 units IV.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.736
Mix up
a pronestyl drip.

27:51.403 --> 27:54.874
He was probably going
to blow up the bus.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.275
There's blood
in the belly.

27:56.308 --> 27:57.476
He's tachy at 120.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.912
Damn terrorists
everywhere you look.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.948
He was Sikh.
They're committed
to non-violence.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.883
Yeah? Why's he wearing
a towel on his head?

28:03.916 --> 28:05.284
Maybe he just got
out of the shower,

28:05.317 --> 28:06.485
which is where
you should be.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.087
Blunt trauma.
Still hypotensive

28:08.120 --> 28:09.889
after a chest tube
and two units.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.423
Looks like an intra-
abdominal bleed.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.759
Probably splenic lac

28:12.759 --> 28:14.761
with fractured ribs
on the left.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.763
Fluid in Morrison's.
Call the OR, book a room.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.364
Pressure's down 50 systolic.

28:18.397 --> 28:19.766
Let's put him in Trendelenburg.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.167
Okay, 100% O2 by mask.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.202
And squeeze in two units
of O-neg.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.336
Let's go.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.872
I'll take him
up myself.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.006
Dr. Romano.

28:27.039 --> 28:27.907
Grab the drug box.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.075
Dr. Romano, your arm.

28:30.509 --> 28:33.312
Damn it!

28:34.213 --> 28:36.849
( sighs )

28:37.850 --> 28:39.218
I'm fine.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.253
Let's just... let's go.
Let's roll.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.789
It's all my own fault.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.791
I should have never married him.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.960
You get one shot, maybe,
at being truly happy.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.796
I had it with Henry Booth

28:49.796 --> 28:51.864
when I was 20...
and I blew it.

28:51.898 --> 28:54.100
Okay, well, I'm going
to come up and check on you

28:54.133 --> 28:56.202
after your chelation therapy.

28:58.905 --> 28:59.972
Till death do they part.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.340
Maybe they deserve
each other.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.342
Hey, do you want to get
some dinner tonight?

29:03.375 --> 29:04.443
Uh... I can't, not tonight.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.812
PABLO:
Abby, I need to pee.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.346
Okay, I'll be right there,
Pablo.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.515
I don't think I can hold it
that long.
I'm coming.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.818
I was kind of hoping that
we could get together.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.820
I can't.
I have a thing.

29:13.853 --> 29:14.987
What thing?

29:15.021 --> 29:16.856
I'm meeting someone.

29:16.889 --> 29:17.990
Who?

29:18.024 --> 29:19.458
My A.A. sponsor.

29:19.491 --> 29:22.128
When did this happen?

29:22.161 --> 29:25.932
I just decided
maybe it was time to say hello.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.834
KOVAC:
Hey, Gallant?

29:27.867 --> 29:28.835
Where's Mrs. Banks?

29:28.868 --> 29:29.969
Who?

29:30.002 --> 29:31.938
You took care
of her facial lac.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.039
What, she's not
in Sutures?

29:33.072 --> 29:34.841
Nope.

29:34.874 --> 29:37.143
Listen, I'm, uh, thinking
of applying for the match.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.377
In emergency medicine.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.079
Bad idea.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.381
Yeah, well, the letter
wasn't for my rotation.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.316
It was for my
residency application.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.551
I know.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.554
( woman yelling in Russian )

29:48.587 --> 29:50.857
KOVAC:
He bit the balloon.

29:50.857 --> 29:51.958
GALLANT:
You think he aspirated?

29:51.991 --> 29:53.225
He looks cyanotic.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.861
Bag him and
get a pulse ox.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.996
( woman speaking Russian )

29:59.465 --> 30:01.600
( whimpers )

30:01.633 --> 30:03.202
It's tough
to ventilate.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.503
It's blocking his airway.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.105
Pedes intubation tray
and a MacGill.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.840
Pulse ox is 81.

30:07.874 --> 30:10.576
( woman speaking frantically
in Russian )

30:10.609 --> 30:12.344
KOVAC:
I'm good at what I do.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.147
I have certain skills,
certain abilities.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.049
They came naturally to me.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.050
You know, perfect fit.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.986
Can you see anything?

30:20.019 --> 30:21.854
It's not about seeing.

30:21.888 --> 30:24.290
Others would struggle
to get through the day,

30:24.323 --> 30:25.892
and I wanted more.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.494
I might have something.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.963
More urgency, more purpose.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.498
( baby crying )

30:32.531 --> 30:34.200
GALLANT:
Stats are coming up.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.567
( crying continues )

30:35.601 --> 30:37.636
( speaking Russian )

30:37.669 --> 30:41.507
The medicine
was exciting, powerful.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.176
Alive.

30:46.078 --> 30:49.581
Today we saved
a teenager's sight,

30:49.615 --> 30:53.619
I saved a child's life...

30:55.054 --> 30:58.624
I didn't feel it.

31:00.059 --> 31:03.629
Didn't feel anything.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.432
Was he stopping at the ER?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.400
They said he was
coming straight up.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.937
Sorry, Kerry, I hope I didn't
keep you waiting.
For what?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.939
I got tied up
with a parathyroidectomy.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.073
Is Robert here?

31:14.106 --> 31:15.674
Our 5:00.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.244
Right, just, uh,
give me a minute.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.478
BRIGHT:
Kerry, what happened?

31:19.511 --> 31:20.947
I've been trying
to reach you.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.581
I was stuck at an EPA site
with the mayor.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.217
I've been calling and
paging you and calling.
Calm down.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.253
This is why we have medical
records and nurses' notes.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.088
Is there a place we...?

31:29.121 --> 31:31.157
This is why we take
a history before we
administer drugs.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.191
Privately, please.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.292
Do you know
that he died?

31:33.325 --> 31:34.460
Keith died.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.428
He went into
anaphylactic shock

31:36.462 --> 31:37.496
and his airway closed.

31:37.529 --> 31:38.364
ROMANO:
Alderman.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.066
What brings you here?

31:40.099 --> 31:42.969
Uh, I'm checking
on a staff member.
Uh-huh.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.470
Well, congratulations
on the budget.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.405
First year they haven't tried
to close us down.

31:46.438 --> 31:47.406
Dr. Weaver did
an excellent job

31:47.439 --> 31:49.008
of articulating
your needs.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.676
Yeah, she's our own
little articulator.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.979
Where are you going, Kerry?
Don't we have this meeting?

31:53.012 --> 31:54.480
( quietly ):
Just give me a second.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.581
You okay?

31:55.614 --> 31:57.416
More trouble
with the arm?

31:57.449 --> 31:59.585
Uh, not worse than getting it
severed in the first place.

31:59.618 --> 32:00.719
I'm glad to hear it.
Stay well.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.188
Yeah, you too.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.557
His airway closed,

32:05.591 --> 32:07.526
but they had
to bag him anyway,

32:07.559 --> 32:10.629
which caused his stomach
to overinflate and tear.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.298
In here.

32:12.331 --> 32:13.699
But they intubated him
anyway.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.068
But then that overinflated
his stomach,

32:16.102 --> 32:18.337
and then there was a tear
in his stomach

32:18.370 --> 32:19.738
that caused septic shock.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.307
But then his
blood pressure dropped

32:21.340 --> 32:22.641
and they couldn't
resuscitate him.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.276
Slow down. Slow down.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.212
I thought he was getting
a shot of penicillin.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.713
We did give him a
shot of penicillin.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.281
That's what caused
the anaphylaxis.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.017
Oh, my God,
what did I do?
Okay, okay.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.618
Unexpected things like this
happen in medicine sometimes.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.120
"Unexpected things."

32:34.153 --> 32:35.587
I didn't ask him
if he was allergic.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.023
We always ask.
But we always have a chart

32:37.023 --> 32:38.357
and the chart reminds us

32:38.390 --> 32:40.159
that we're treating
the patient correctly.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.628
Yes, you could have asked.
It wouldn't have prevented it.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.430
I could have given him
something else.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.298
Or better yet, nothing.
Nothing at all.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.434
I told him it would be
a shot of penicillin

32:48.467 --> 32:50.202
even before I approached you.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.704
He didn't tell me
he was allergic.
He didn't know.

32:52.738 --> 32:55.741
This would have happened anyway,
however he got treated.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.309
( knocking )

32:57.343 --> 32:59.178
They're waiting for you
in the conference.

32:59.211 --> 33:02.081
Anspaugh needs
to scrub in.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.050
Have them start without me.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.317
BRIGHT:
All right.

33:05.351 --> 33:08.487
Um, there's already no record
of the shot.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.689
It's too late for that.
Um...

33:10.722 --> 33:12.358
We could tell the truth.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.759
No one else knows?

33:13.792 --> 33:15.161
Not yet.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.663
Keith didn't say anything
about me?

33:17.696 --> 33:18.797
For God's sake.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.332
Oh, my God, he's dead.

33:20.366 --> 33:21.733
I know, I know...
Jonathan, he's dead.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.335
It hurts me more
than you know.

33:23.369 --> 33:24.670
Hurts you?
That's crap.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.072
You let that
poor kid believe

33:26.072 --> 33:27.339
he gave you
the syphilis.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.375
Don't tell me I don't care.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.077
I care.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.747
I care.

33:37.783 --> 33:40.519
But I do need to know
what people know

33:40.552 --> 33:42.521
self-servingly, yes.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.757
I have to protect myself,
but I also have to protect you.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.559
And I have to protect
this hospital

33:47.593 --> 33:49.228
and a dozen other
county programs.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.097
What about protecting
your staff?

33:51.130 --> 33:52.698
What about protecting
your lover?

33:52.731 --> 33:54.833
Kerry... this is not your fault.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.568
You understand?

33:56.602 --> 33:57.836
It's not your fault.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.139
But if you confess
to something like it was,

34:00.172 --> 34:04.576
people will treat you
like it was.

34:04.610 --> 34:07.813
And then everybody loses.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.755
Did he say anything about me?

34:18.757 --> 34:19.791
Don't worry.

34:19.824 --> 34:21.627
He lied for you.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.195
He loved you.

34:25.331 --> 34:28.500
( knocking )
They're starting.

34:30.735 --> 34:35.806
And I killed him
trying to hide that for you.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.813
Yes, you won't want to be late
for that meeting.

34:42.848 --> 34:46.252
But I will need you later
for a press conference.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.387
He was one of my staff.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.589
Good-bye, Jonathan.

34:50.621 --> 34:54.260
Congratulations, Kerry.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.827
ROMANO:
Hold on.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.863
I never let rehab
compromise my work
schedule.

34:57.896 --> 35:01.233
We both know administration
is not your strong suit.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.801
Should I come back later?

35:02.834 --> 35:04.503
No, Kerry,
this involves you.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.572
How long you been
planning this?

35:06.605 --> 35:08.807
I've asked Robert
to consider sharing

35:08.840 --> 35:10.842
the Chief of Staff position
with you.

35:10.876 --> 35:14.313
I'd rather cut
off my good arm.

35:14.346 --> 35:15.847
I'm sorry you feel that way,
Robert.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.717
I thought this was a solution
that served everyone.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.819
Well, you were wrong.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.654
It's a gift, Robert.

35:22.688 --> 35:23.855
I suggest you take it.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.358
Take it right up the ass.

35:26.392 --> 35:27.793
Fine.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.395
Congratulations, Kerry.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.631
You've just become
Chief of Staff.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.210
No disruption
of the vasculature.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.878
No, there wouldn't be
with the mechanism of injury.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.480
What's next?

35:48.514 --> 35:50.582
Let's see, I could cut it
while slicing a bagel

35:50.616 --> 35:52.718
and not realize it
till I pass out from blood loss.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.220
Robert.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.854
Or maybe I could set
the damn thing on fire.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.423
( sighing )

35:57.456 --> 35:59.825
You need to
be patient.

35:59.858 --> 36:02.528
Yes, so everyone
keeps telling me.

36:02.561 --> 36:05.231
Although none of us
actually believe

36:05.264 --> 36:07.799
I'm even going
to partially recover,

36:07.833 --> 36:12.238
do we?

36:12.271 --> 36:14.473
Believe in the laws of karma,
Elizabeth?

36:14.506 --> 36:15.874
Eastern philosophy,

36:15.907 --> 36:18.677
the influence of past actions
on your future life.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.312
I know what it is.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.617
So, I can be a jerk.

36:25.651 --> 36:26.618
So what?

36:26.652 --> 36:29.988
I've always
been honest.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.457
Brutally honest.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.493
Bruised some egos,
hurt some feelings,

36:34.526 --> 36:37.729
maybe, uh, provoked
a few tears, but, uh...

36:37.763 --> 36:40.666
honesty's a hell of a lot more
than most people can claim.

36:44.636 --> 36:47.339
I don't deserve this.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.578
Hey, what time
is your thing?

36:52.611 --> 36:56.782
Uh, she's probably waiting
for me right now.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.817
Did you get your car fixed?

36:58.850 --> 37:02.288
Yeah. One of these days,
I'm going to get one that works.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.725
So...

37:09.895 --> 37:11.530
You know, right?

37:13.432 --> 37:14.566
Know what?

37:14.600 --> 37:16.302
That night at
the restaurant.

37:16.302 --> 37:20.806
I had a ring-- you
knew that, right?

37:20.839 --> 37:24.476
I figured if, if you
wanted to talk about it,
you would have.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.713
I didn't go through with it
because in that moment,

37:27.746 --> 37:30.949
it just felt...

37:30.982 --> 37:33.018
It didn't feel right,
and I don't know why,

37:33.051 --> 37:34.786
and I wish I
did know why,

37:34.820 --> 37:36.988
but I think the fact
that I didn't do it

37:37.022 --> 37:40.326
means that maybe
there's something
that isn't working.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.328
I get it.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.964
It's okay.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.570
I got to go.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.506
You get it?

37:54.540 --> 37:56.074
Well, that's good.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.476
Maybe you can
explain it to me,

37:57.509 --> 37:58.677
because I don't get it.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.346
I know that I
show up for work,

38:00.379 --> 38:02.381
and you act like
a completely
changed person,

38:02.414 --> 38:04.383
and I think that's great,
if that's real.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.351
The patch, the sponsor...

38:05.351 --> 38:06.618
Real?

38:06.652 --> 38:07.986
For real. For you.
Or is this something

38:08.019 --> 38:09.721
that's going to get
thrown out the window

38:09.755 --> 38:11.457
the next time
something bad happens,

38:11.490 --> 38:14.460
'cause if you're trying
to prove something to me,

38:14.493 --> 38:16.395
like some kind
of quick fix...

38:16.428 --> 38:18.364
I didn't do it
for you.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.499
I woke up sick of myself, okay?

38:20.532 --> 38:23.969
And if you're sick of me,
and, and just all of it,

38:24.002 --> 38:25.070
I don't blame you.

38:25.103 --> 38:26.372
I'm not sick of you.

38:26.372 --> 38:27.673
How do you hear that?

38:27.706 --> 38:29.708
Because all I ever do
is disappoint you.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.643
I feel like
all I'm ever going to do

38:31.677 --> 38:32.811
is disappoint you.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.446
I don't know why...
Stop, stop!

38:34.480 --> 38:35.947
Stop with this whole routine--

38:35.981 --> 38:37.783
this whole fatalistic
black cloud,

38:37.816 --> 38:40.386
nothing-good-is-ever-
going-to-happen routine.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.521
It's not a routine.
What do I have to say?

38:42.554 --> 38:46.758
What do I have to do
to get through to you?

40:11.643 --> 40:12.844
She needs
a stable environment.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.680
She is the one
that's unstable.

40:14.713 --> 40:15.781
Yeah, I wonder why.

40:15.814 --> 40:16.748
Luka...

40:16.782 --> 40:17.916
She's your daughter.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.551
I've got this
now, thank you.

40:19.585 --> 40:20.786
Do you
even give a damn?

40:20.819 --> 40:22.053
Thank you.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.155
Does he think
that this is the first time

40:24.189 --> 40:27.493
I've ever had to make this kind
of decision with Molly?

40:27.526 --> 40:29.227
I wish to God it was,
but it's not.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.530
Well, if she wants
to come home...

40:31.563 --> 40:33.732
Now. She's scared,
she got hurt,

40:33.765 --> 40:36.167
but what happens
when we get there,

40:36.201 --> 40:37.603
and it starts
all over again?

40:37.636 --> 40:38.637
You try harder.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.071
I have--
a thousand times.

40:40.105 --> 40:46.812
Maybe I am a bad mother,
but I can't do it anymore.

40:46.845 --> 40:49.047
Enjoy her
when she's this age.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.583
She's not old enough
to hate you.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.863
I was, uh, I was trying
to calm the baby--

41:04.896 --> 41:07.633
you know, with the
glove, the little...

41:07.666 --> 41:09.601
Don't worry about it.

41:09.635 --> 41:12.538
Yeah, but he
could have died.

41:12.538 --> 41:14.540
Yup, but he didn't.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.683
I think
you're one of the best

41:24.716 --> 41:26.952
medical students
that's come through here

41:26.985 --> 41:28.253
in a long time.

41:28.286 --> 41:31.557
Well, the place
will be lucky to have you.

41:44.102 --> 41:47.639
A letter from me
wouldn't mean much.

41:47.673 --> 41:49.608
They only tolerate me.

41:49.641 --> 41:52.778
Know I can burn
through a shift.

41:52.811 --> 41:56.648
Tomorrow I'll get up
and do it again.

41:59.284 --> 42:00.586
WOMAN:
Have you thought

42:00.586 --> 42:01.787
about taking
some time off?

42:01.820 --> 42:04.656
Yeah, yeah.

42:04.690 --> 42:07.058
Maybe moving home--
I don't know.

42:11.863 --> 42:15.200
There's a cartoon
I once saw in a magazine.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.869
A little man
is sitting in a room

42:17.903 --> 42:19.771
with two doors.

42:19.805 --> 42:23.308
One door says "Do not enter,"

42:23.341 --> 42:26.678
and the other door says
"Do not exit."

42:26.712 --> 42:33.084
So, um... he just sits there...

42:33.118 --> 42:35.621
holding his hat.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.295
We only have
15 minutes left.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.738
Did you want
to keep talking...

42:53.939 --> 42:56.875
or do you want to get to it?

43:04.983 --> 43:08.954
One dispo, two admits,
and I am out of here.

43:08.987 --> 43:11.122
Are you ready?

43:11.156 --> 43:14.893
Yeah, but, uh,
I wasn't going to change.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.995
Hey, this way I go
straight to the casino.

43:17.028 --> 43:19.097
Where you can sing backup
for Tony Orlando.

43:19.130 --> 43:20.331
Who?

43:20.365 --> 43:21.767
Never mind.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.968
I'll meet you outside.

43:23.001 --> 43:24.202
Okay, I'll get a cab.
Okay.

43:24.235 --> 43:26.004
Excuse me, miss,
can you tell me

43:26.037 --> 43:27.272
how to get to the cafeteria?

43:27.305 --> 43:28.740
Uh, I'm sorry.
I don't work here.

43:28.774 --> 43:29.775
Oh.

43:29.808 --> 43:31.009
BRIGHT:
All of us at City Hall

43:31.042 --> 43:34.179
are saddened by the loss
of Keith Mitchell.

43:34.212 --> 43:38.083
He was a bright
and vibrant young man,

43:38.116 --> 43:41.419
who had a promising future
in public service.

43:41.452 --> 43:45.123
He devoted himself to bring
dignity and opportunity

43:45.156 --> 43:47.993
to the underserved members
of our community.

43:48.026 --> 43:52.063
Even though his death was sudden
unexpected and heartbreaking.

43:52.097 --> 43:56.301
His spirit will live on
through his contributions to
social programs

43:56.334 --> 44:00.238
and through the thousands of
lives he touched.

44:00.271 --> 44:01.807
All our thoughts
and prayers

44:01.840 --> 44:04.976
go out to Keith's family,
to his many friends

44:05.010 --> 44:09.715
and to all those affected by
this unavoidable tragedy.
