Yeah, nah, it is.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.320
I guess I'll see you around then, innit?

13:38.600 --> 13:39.600
Safe.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.320
Look, first of all, bro,
I just want to say I'm sorry, innit?

13:48.400 --> 13:50.000
Look, I know I fucked up.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.480
Bringing my phone on that job
and shit was my bad.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.840
Hey, but look, listen,
I must have gone to sell the watch to Mia,

13:55.920 --> 13:58.280
and, bro, just a fucking madness happened.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.560
You know the brother of that yute,
the one you...

14:01.440 --> 14:03.080
Well, the one from the other day.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.000
Listen, he must have recognised me
or something,

14:05.080 --> 14:06.960
cos long story short,
he knows it's us, bro.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
He knows we did it.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.840
It was mad. I was standing up
face to face with him, bro.

14:10.920 --> 14:11.920
It was crazy.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.280
[Gogo] Obviously things
are a little bit nuts right now, innit?

14:15.360 --> 14:18.600
I'm thinking I need to lay low,
maybe like get out of town for a bit.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.560
I'm just thinking, you know,
give me the money you owe me,

14:20.640 --> 14:22.080
-and then me and Jess can...
-Bro.

14:22.880 --> 14:27.080
You keep talking about I owe you this
and I owe you that.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.160
Let's get one thing straight...

14:30.360 --> 14:31.960
I don't owe you nothing.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.760
It's what I decide to give you,
you understand?

14:37.320 --> 14:40.320
Furthermore, what did you actually see?

14:41.400 --> 14:42.680
You said my name, innit?

14:42.760 --> 14:44.280
No, never.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.360
Slim, come on, man.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.000
Alright. Cool.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.480
But I wouldn't like that, you know, Gogo.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.040
I wouldn't like that at all.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.760

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
Yeah.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.480
Yeah, but I left it on my spot.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.960
Didn't really wanna roll with it
like that, you get me?

15:17.640 --> 15:19.360
Don't worry, though, it's safe.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.320
when the roads are empty,

15:55.400 --> 15:57.000
I wanna hold the watch still

15:57.080 --> 15:59.480
and give you some p's
on top of what I've got for you.

15:59.560 --> 16:00.800
So what? You're gonna keep it?

16:00.880 --> 16:01.920
Yeah, are you deaf?

16:02.600 --> 16:04.000
You can't sell it.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.920
Well, anyway, tomorrow we'll settle up
everything once and for all.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.880

I need you to go see him still.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.280
Man, it's a lot of hassle
for a watch, bro.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.840
Don't you think?

16:38.920 --> 16:40.920
You have to see it to understand it, bro.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.560
