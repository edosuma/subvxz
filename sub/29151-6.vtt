00:08.850 --> 00:11.844
We will let Chester
know what happened.

00:11.921 --> 00:13.863
He'll want to know
where to find you.

00:13.939 --> 00:15.581
I left him a letter.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.505
Huh!

It follow you.

03:53.509 --> 03:55.760
You did the right thing, dear.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.844
Children can't be raised

03:56.921 --> 03:59.421
on the streets.

25:15.790 --> 25:17.031
Wake up, buddy.

25:17.108 --> 25:20.168
You're home.

25:22.863 --> 25:24.005
Chester?

25:54.645 --> 25:55.986
Nakayama, Chester.

25:55.997 --> 25:58.748
Medical discharge.

26:02.078 --> 26:03.670
Chester.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.006
Where's Luz?

26:07.083 --> 26:08.841
She's okay.

26:10.420 --> 26:12.595
But her father
came, and...

26:14.373 --> 26:15.631
She left?

26:15.708 --> 26:17.517
I'm sorry.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.683
She asked me to send it.

26:25.694 --> 26:26.684
You needed happy thoughts,

26:26.695 --> 26:28.528
not this.

27:29.665 --> 27:32.374
The spirit follows you.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.761
It killed your sons.

27:34.837 --> 27:36.929
It drove Luz mad.

27:37.006 --> 27:39.340
It's your fault
my husband died.

27:39.416 --> 27:41.142
Now you put everyone
in danger!

28:07.611 --> 28:09.411
You should rest.
Let's go home.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.631
She's right.

28:11.707 --> 28:13.174
A spirit does follow me.

28:14.043 --> 28:16.803
It followed me
across the Pacific.

28:16.879 --> 28:17.920
That jeep crash,

28:17.997 --> 28:20.256
it was no accident.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.850
It tried to kill me.

28:25.054 --> 28:26.646
Did it do this too?

28:26.722 --> 28:27.596
Chester, please.

28:27.673 --> 28:28.597
Don't listen to this nonsense.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.975
What was she talking about?

28:30.985 --> 28:33.611
What did she mean,
you brought this on?

28:35.848 --> 28:37.782
Son...

28:52.748 --> 28:53.965
Ma?

28:57.086 --> 28:57.969
Ma, let me go.

28:59.046 --> 29:00.513
Let me go!

29:10.024 --> 29:11.566
<i>Yurei...</i>

29:54.644 --> 29:56.393
Taizo...

30:03.185 --> 30:04.151
Ma!

30:04.228 --> 30:05.494
- Asako!
- Ma!

30:07.731 --> 30:09.073
What happened?

30:09.149 --> 30:10.157
Asako!

30:10.234 --> 30:11.292
Ma!

30:13.329 --> 30:14.337
Chester?

30:15.197 --> 30:16.589
Ma!

30:20.428 --> 30:22.586
She was inside me.

30:22.597 --> 30:24.180
But I was there too.

30:26.267 --> 30:29.718
I had to watch my hands...

30:29.795 --> 30:31.854
my own hands...

30:33.516 --> 30:35.599
I tried...

30:35.610 --> 30:39.445
I tried to control my body.

30:39.522 --> 30:42.698
I fought so hard, but I...

30:43.934 --> 30:46.035
I couldn't do it.

30:48.623 --> 30:49.956
I felt the spirit.

30:52.276 --> 30:56.078
So much pain.

30:56.155 --> 30:59.581
So much desire.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.793
Like a tremendous hunger.

31:02.804 --> 31:04.470
<i>Onnen.</i>

31:05.664 --> 31:07.381
What is it?

31:07.458 --> 31:09.058
What does it want?

31:13.505 --> 31:15.273
You.

31:17.560 --> 31:20.060
Then it was her.

31:20.137 --> 31:21.645
Who?

31:21.722 --> 31:23.480
I had a sister,

31:23.491 --> 31:25.941
died many years ago.

31:26.018 --> 31:29.111
Her name was Yuko.

31:29.188 --> 31:32.322
Your sister...

31:32.333 --> 31:33.824
is the <i>yurei?</i>

31:33.835 --> 31:34.950
She was...

31:35.027 --> 31:37.244
Hideo's picture bride.

31:37.321 --> 31:40.122
But he shunned her.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.291
Sent her away.

31:42.368 --> 31:45.553
She went to
the Badger Avenue bridge.

31:46.705 --> 31:49.798
She jumped.

31:49.875 --> 31:52.259
Jesus.

31:52.336 --> 31:55.062
But then what does
she want with me?

32:03.105 --> 32:06.482
When she came to Hideo,

32:06.558 --> 32:08.817
she was...

32:08.894 --> 32:10.953
with child already.

32:20.122 --> 32:24.291
It called me her child.

32:24.368 --> 32:27.044
Taizo.

32:27.055 --> 32:28.462
Is that...

32:28.539 --> 32:31.640
Taizo is the name
she gave you.

32:33.636 --> 32:35.061
I'm sorry.

33:11.599 --> 33:13.724
Taizo...

33:18.255 --> 33:19.588
<i>I was still in Japan</i>

33:19.665 --> 33:22.608
<i>when I found out my sister
had taken her life.</i>

33:23.594 --> 33:24.685
I vowed

33:24.761 --> 33:27.354
that I would never
let my sister's child

33:27.431 --> 33:29.949
be an orphan.

33:30.025 --> 33:33.285
I made
the crossing.

33:33.362 --> 33:35.579
We took you.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.169
And my father?

33:43.414 --> 33:45.539
A soldier.

33:45.616 --> 33:47.925
He died at war.

33:53.457 --> 33:56.100
All these years...

33:57.979 --> 34:00.146
All my life...

34:03.467 --> 34:04.875
Those meals at the table

34:04.877 --> 34:08.395
when you looked me in the eye
and never said a word...

34:08.472 --> 34:09.730
How?

34:09.806 --> 34:12.533
We feared
the truth would hurt.

34:13.870 --> 34:16.495
You mean it would hurt you.

34:17.831 --> 34:19.039
Son...

34:27.074 --> 34:30.217
Don't you call me that.

34:31.411 --> 34:34.513
She's my blood.

34:34.590 --> 34:37.516
You are nothing.

35:44.901 --> 35:46.377
Taizo...

36:30.280 --> 36:32.298
Yuko...

36:43.886 --> 36:45.761
<i>Yurei..</i>

36:45.837 --> 36:48.764
How can this be?

36:48.840 --> 36:51.767
I don't know.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.819
You know the traditions.

36:53.896 --> 36:55.103
You need to help us.

36:55.180 --> 36:58.991
I am not <i>onmyoji.</i>

36:59.068 --> 37:02.694
I only know
pieces of old <i>kaidan.</i>

37:02.771 --> 37:05.664
That's more than most.

37:13.657 --> 37:18.510
Her spirit...
somewhere else.

37:18.587 --> 37:21.513
<i>Kaidan</i> tell us

37:21.590 --> 37:24.132
unfulfilled soul

37:24.143 --> 37:27.594
need body to occupy.

37:27.671 --> 37:30.022
If we destroy body,

37:30.099 --> 37:32.191
soul cannot exist.

37:32.267 --> 37:34.026
Destroy the body?

37:35.387 --> 37:37.104
Destroy her body.

37:37.180 --> 37:38.271
No...

37:38.348 --> 37:39.698
It is not her.

37:39.775 --> 37:41.367
Not anymore.

37:41.443 --> 37:42.609
Her spirit
must be set free.

37:42.686 --> 37:44.870
Please.

37:44.947 --> 37:46.330
This must be done.

38:02.297 --> 38:04.890
She looks just like
I remember.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.686
A girl...

38:10.973 --> 38:14.024
...preparing to meet
her husband.

38:31.827 --> 38:34.661
Yes.

38:34.738 --> 38:36.422
It must be done.

38:45.841 --> 38:47.007
<i>Namu Amida Butsu...</i>

38:47.083 --> 38:48.934

39:49.813 --> 39:51.830
Leave me.

Please.
