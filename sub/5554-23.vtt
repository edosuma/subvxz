00:00.001 --> 00:02.468
<i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...

00:02.470 --> 00:04.570
CABE: Meet my new trainee,
Tim Armstrong.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.471
Hello.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.206
I was thinking

00:07.208 --> 00:09.208
maybe you and I
could get a meal.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.210
Oh, like a...

00:11.212 --> 00:12.277
BOTH:
Date?

00:12.279 --> 00:13.212
Only if you'd like.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.747
Paige and-and you?

00:14.749 --> 00:16.599
I took your advice.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.450
I have the opportunity to have
dinner with a smart, kind,

00:18.452 --> 00:20.719
beautiful woman, and I'd be
a fool not to go for her, right?

00:20.721 --> 00:23.055
You know the name Mark Collins?

00:23.057 --> 00:24.723
WALTER:<i> Mark used to work</i>
<i> at my company, Scorpion.</i>

00:24.725 --> 00:27.259
<i> Mark's a radio expert.</i>

00:27.261 --> 00:29.495
<i>He monitors nearly every signal</i>
<i> that passes through the air.</i>

00:29.497 --> 00:31.030
So this guy was like you guys?

00:31.032 --> 00:32.398
With Mark it was intense,
though.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.401
When he bailed,
it was the best thing for us,

00:35.403 --> 00:38.270
and him being back is the worst.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.672
WALTER:<i> Three years ago, I had</i>
<i> him committed to an asylum.</i>

00:40.674 --> 00:43.075
Do you have any idea
how badly that hurt me?

00:43.077 --> 00:44.376
You hate me for
what I did, I get it.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.078
We could have accomplished
anything together,

00:46.080 --> 00:47.146
but you ruined that.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.315
TOBY: During the early years
of Scorpion,

00:50.317 --> 00:51.750
Mark Collins showed
incredible brilliance.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.318
One of the smartest
members of the team.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.754
He amazed me,
all of us.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.589
He also scared us.

00:57.591 --> 00:58.557
How so?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.159
He gets lost in his own mind,

01:00.161 --> 01:02.361
in his thoughts
and his theories,

01:02.363 --> 01:04.730
and if you disagree
with one of his constructs,

01:04.732 --> 01:06.632
he lashes out, gets violent.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.067
He's just jealous.

01:08.069 --> 01:09.835
Mr. Collins, you'll have
your chance to speak.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.303
TOBY:
You see that look he has.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.838
That's a one; you don't
want to see him at ten.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.373
JUDGE: As someone who's worked
with the applicant

01:14.375 --> 01:16.675
and known him
in a personal capacity,

01:16.677 --> 01:18.444
do you have an opinion

01:18.445 --> 01:20.212
regarding his potential
release from this facility?

01:20.214 --> 01:22.548
Well, as a former colleague
and as a psychiatrist

01:22.550 --> 01:23.582
with a degree from...

01:23.584 --> 01:26.185
BOTH:
Harvard Medical School.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.319
Big deal.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.688
I don't need some
elbow-patch professor

01:29.690 --> 01:31.924
to tell me what to think.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.159
I create my own knowledge.
Create your own reality, Mark.

01:34.161 --> 01:37.129
You've always hated me because
I came between you and Walter.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.866
Because I was
his favorite mind.

01:40.868 --> 01:45.537
We went places together that
you can never even fathom, Toby.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.840
All up here. All up there.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.374
I'm sure it's lovely in there

01:49.376 --> 01:51.210
with all the elf socials
and unicorn parties.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.112
JUDGE:
Dr. Curtis.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.581
I just simply need your
opinion for the record

01:55.583 --> 01:58.283
with respect to
Mr. Collins' sanity.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.852
How say you?

01:59.854 --> 02:01.487
Medically speaking...

02:01.489 --> 02:03.655
he's nuttier
than peanut brittle.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.124
I will kill you!

02:05.126 --> 02:06.859
I will kill you!

02:06.861 --> 02:09.595
I will kill you,
I will kill you, Toby.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.663
(laughs)

02:12.867 --> 02:13.899
(laughs)

02:15.169 --> 02:16.301
See?

02:16.303 --> 02:18.370
My diagnosis is always spot-on.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.706
I am almost spot-on.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.174
HAPPY:
Today.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.842
It's "weights and measures,"
not "wait forever."

02:23.844 --> 02:25.511
I am precise.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.513
If it's nougat, we're
talking whipped egg whites,

02:27.515 --> 02:29.815
sugar, honey and
nut shavings.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.683
Very light. But if it's caramel,

02:31.685 --> 02:34.153
well, it could be heavier
by a fraction of a gram.

Let's wrap it up-- he's gonna
get sick from all this candy.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.836
Not yet.
I need to win my money back

02:50.838 --> 02:52.471
before Toby returns
from the nut house.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.606
Can't let him near gambling.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.875
Okay, speaking of nuts,
look at the swirl

02:56.877 --> 02:58.877
on the bottom here,
how the chocolate lays

02:58.879 --> 03:00.412

03:13.194 --> 03:14.760

03:14.762 --> 03:17.529
Oh. Right. Well, you can tell
them Homeland will cover it.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.298
It's not our
responsibil... Oh.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.766
Are those chocolates?

03:20.768 --> 03:22.267
I... enjoy chocolates.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.969
Mmm.
Tim sent them to Paige.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.504
(grunts)

03:26.540 --> 03:28.440
Not good. Low quality.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.908
(phone rings)

03:29.910 --> 03:31.210
I'll get that.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.245
(turns off music)
(clears throat)

03:34.381 --> 03:35.847
Hey, Ralph, you want to...?
Hello.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.850
Yeah?
Happy.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.819
You know these candies
weren't just for me,

03:40.821 --> 03:42.721
they were for the whole team.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.622
Uh, the whole team hasn't been
on three dates with Tim

03:44.625 --> 03:46.558
in the past week--
it was addressed to you.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.493
'Cause he knows
I sign for the packages.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.329
It's a square box,
not heart-shaped.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.997
We've just gone to a few
restaurants together.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.266
He's a sweet guy, though.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.002
WALTER:
Okay, so

03:57.004 --> 03:58.320
when will you be back?

03:58.321 --> 03:59.637
Not sure.
Judge called a recess.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.940
You aggravated Collins,
didn't you?

04:01.942 --> 04:03.625
No. It was uneventful.

04:03.626 --> 04:05.309
I knew I should've gone.
Collins was a good friend--

04:05.312 --> 04:06.678
maybe I could have talked to him
or something.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.879
Let me save you the guilt, pal.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.314
Collins is deep
in the rabbit hole.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.582
There is no pulling him out.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.484
Now, what's going on over there?
Oh, not much.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.319
Cabe's coming in with something
soon-- in the meantime,

04:14.321 --> 04:15.621
they're guessing what's
inside chocolates.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.655
Chocolates?

04:16.657 --> 04:17.789
Save me some chocolates.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.625
Oh, boy, did Tim
send Paige chocolates?

04:21.595 --> 04:24.496
Walter?

04:24.498 --> 04:25.430
That Toby?

04:25.432 --> 04:26.765
Yup.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.434
Did he aggravate Collins? Yup.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.275
"Lake Tahoe Jazz and
Heritage Festival."

04:36.277 --> 04:39.278
Yeah, I was... I was
gonna go with Linda, but...

04:39.280 --> 04:41.446
Oh. So are you
doing okay?

04:41.448 --> 04:43.582
I mean, it's got to suck to
see Paige getting romanced

04:43.584 --> 04:45.450
while you're holding two
tickets to lonely-ville.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.319
Tim can send
all the candy he wants.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.720
It does not upset me.
Really?

04:48.722 --> 04:51.323
Then why do all the high
scores on<i> Proton Arnold</i>

04:51.325 --> 04:52.841
have your initials now?

04:52.842 --> 04:54.358
I mean, you hadn't
played for a year,

04:54.361 --> 04:55.527
but once Tim
topped you...

04:55.529 --> 04:57.362
Don't analyze me.
You're not Toby.

04:57.364 --> 05:00.666
No. Toby would couch
his theories in psychobabble.

05:00.668 --> 05:04.369
I'm just gonna tell you:
you're screwing up.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.905
(sighs) Okay, well, Cabe's coming
in soon... You're letting Paige

05:06.907 --> 05:09.641
slip away because you're scared by
the theory of repetitive outcomes.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.043
That is an economics hypothesis

05:11.045 --> 05:12.911
gauging investor behavior.
It applies.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.047
Every time you've loved
someone, it ends painfully.

05:15.049 --> 05:17.416
You wanted to connect
with your parents as a kid,

05:17.418 --> 05:18.784
but now you barely
talk to them.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.086
You do connect with Megan;
she passes away.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.921
Then the Linda
experiment collapses.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.124
So when it comes to Paige...
Paige?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.326
Yes. The woman you've been
crazy about since you met her.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.561
You're so scared of an outcome
where you lose her altogether,

05:29.563 --> 05:31.930
so you're sitting back, pretending the
whole Tim thing doesn't bother you,

05:31.932 --> 05:34.433
but guess what-- you're
gonna lose her altogether.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.071
Well, the Tim thing
does not bother me.

05:39.073 --> 05:41.940
In any case,
chocolates are a lame gift.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.042
Paige likes salty sweets.

Chernobyl Power Plant--

06:04.398 --> 06:06.431
in terms of cost and casualties,

06:06.433 --> 06:08.567
worst nuclear accident
in history,

even though only a
fraction of cesium

06:10.371 --> 06:12.003

(grunts)

06:17.711 --> 06:19.010
So, why are we needed?

06:19.012 --> 06:20.979
Chernobyl was contained
30 years ago.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.548
Well, it<i> was</i> contained
and it<i> wasn't</i> contained,

06:23.550 --> 06:26.385
if you know what I mean. We don't, because
we don't speak in contradictions.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.986
So what's the issue?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.454
CABE:
After the meltdown,

06:29.455 --> 06:30.921
the Soviet Union went
into survival mode.

06:30.924 --> 06:31.890
OKSANA:
We poured hundreds

06:31.892 --> 06:33.692
of thousands of tons of concrete

06:33.694 --> 06:37.028
to create makeshift dome
over plant to trap radiation,

06:37.030 --> 06:38.864
because explosion blasted

06:38.866 --> 06:41.032
the reactor lid through the roof.
WALTER: That's smart.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.901
Concrete is an effective block
to radiation.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.004
Only if it's top quality
and properly constructed.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.940
This was Cold War-era garbage
thrown up in a panic.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.992
Decades later, it's decaying

06:50.993 --> 06:53.043
and it might not be able to
insulate the corium much longer.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.045
What's corium?

06:54.046 --> 06:55.045
OKSANA:
A molten mixture

06:55.046 --> 06:56.045
of nuclear reactor
core material

06:56.049 --> 06:57.682
formed during meltdown.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.918
Highly dangerous.
A slow-moving lava mass

06:59.920 --> 07:02.854
that quickly forms
hardened outer shell

07:02.856 --> 07:04.022
that prevents most
radiation escape.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.157
SYLVESTER:
Like a chocolate

07:05.159 --> 07:07.092
with the worst filling ever.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.094
This is the corium

07:09.096 --> 07:11.997
at Chernobyl, nicknamed the "Elephant's
Foot." Photograph was taken

07:11.999 --> 07:15.467
15 years ago by a maniac who
entered the facility unauthorized.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.036
Anonymously posted online,
it's the only known view

07:18.038 --> 07:21.206
of the interior since
the day of the disaster.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.008
Can you imagine if the shell
on that thing cracked?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.176
Radiation city.
This is exactly

07:24.178 --> 07:25.610
what we worry about.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.746
The dome is decaying.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.614
If it gets much worse,
it won't be able

07:29.616 --> 07:31.216
to keep elements from
falling into the plant.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.185
And if rain or snow lands
on the corium,

07:33.187 --> 07:35.487
we get deadly
toxic steam clouds.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.489
SYLVESTER: That get into the
atmosphere, move hundreds of miles,

07:37.491 --> 07:40.192
fall down via rain,
and seep into the groundwater.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.127
CABE: If the corium's
radiation escapes,

07:42.129 --> 07:44.896
the majority of Eastern Europe's
soil and water supply

07:44.898 --> 07:46.231
will be unusable.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.967
740 million people

07:48.969 --> 07:51.036
permanently displaced.
PAIGE: The world

07:51.038 --> 07:53.538
had to see this coming--
what was done in preparation?

07:53.540 --> 07:56.608
Well, the Energy Council built a massive
multibillion- dollar sarcophagus,

07:56.610 --> 07:59.611
the largest movable structure
in the world.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.597
Is impermeable.

08:01.598 --> 08:03.582
Will cover current dome
and will contain radiation

08:03.584 --> 08:06.117
for at least 150 years.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.786
And by then five half-lives

08:07.788 --> 08:10.021
of the cesium used
in the reactor will have passed.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.591
Making Chernobyl
and surrounding area

08:12.593 --> 08:14.693
safe for habitation once again.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.894
But...?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.929
But over the years the
radiation has leaked

08:17.931 --> 08:20.131
around the reactor and it's
weakened the ground strength.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.233
OKSANA:
Sarcophagus weighs

08:21.235 --> 08:23.101
several thousand tons,

08:23.103 --> 08:24.936
so someone needs to determine

08:24.938 --> 08:27.839
the strongest points
on the ground around facility.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.808
So the engineers will
know the exact position

08:29.810 --> 08:31.142
in which to place
the sarcophagus

08:31.144 --> 08:33.078
so it doesn't sink
into weakened earth,

08:33.080 --> 08:35.180
creating gaps that
would allow radiation to escape,

08:35.182 --> 08:37.082
defeating its purpose. SYLVESTER:
And we're the someones

08:37.084 --> 08:39.117
that are supposed
to figure this out?

08:39.119 --> 08:41.086
That's what the Energy Council
is hoping for, yes.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.555
Well, why us?
The council has engineers.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.123
If we are even
one degree off

08:45.125 --> 08:47.726
in getting sarcophagus
in perfect position,

08:47.728 --> 08:50.161
we could have humanitarian
crisis that cannot be resolved.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.098
Our engineers have
done all they can do.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.101
Structure is built,
is waiting to be put in place.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.403
All that is left

08:58.404 --> 09:00.704
is getting the smartest
and fastest minds available,

09:00.707 --> 09:02.841
all of which are
in this room.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.714
To pull this thing off, we need to
get radiation samples from the air.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.183
WALTER:
From inside the plant itself.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.152
We can extrapolate
the decay rate of the topsoil

09:14.154 --> 09:16.254
based on the data
that we collect.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.822
We run numbers...
Find out exactly

09:17.824 --> 09:19.624
how to position the sarcophagus

09:19.626 --> 09:21.593
so it creates
a tight radiation seal.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.827
But the only way
we can get the data

09:22.829 --> 09:24.796
is by being inside the facility.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.831
After an hour,
we'd have fatal

09:26.833 --> 09:28.750
radiation exposure.

09:28.751 --> 09:30.668
If Cabe can get me one of those
police bomb squad robots,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.171
I can tweak the sucker

09:32.172 --> 09:33.672
and send it in
to get the samples we need.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.674
I can draft software that
models the probability

09:35.676 --> 09:38.777
of radiation fallout on the
grounds around the dome

09:38.779 --> 09:40.845
based on traditional
weather patterns.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.814
Okay, perfect. So,
Toby's tied up at the hearing,

09:42.816 --> 09:44.215
but he can coordinate
our findings

09:44.217 --> 09:45.817
here at the garage
when he's done.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.285
I'll go find us a robot.
The rest of you

09:47.287 --> 09:49.788
get your passports.
(taps table)

09:49.790 --> 09:51.890
I wish I didn't even
have a passport.

09:54.761 --> 09:58.063
♪ ♪

10:02.169 --> 10:04.169
The entire drive
from the airport,

10:04.171 --> 10:05.837
it just got
more and more desolate.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.340
Yeah, well, Chernobyl
is hardly prime real estate.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.609
Right now we're getting
the radiation equivalent

10:10.611 --> 10:12.728
of being closer to the sun

10:12.729 --> 10:14.846
on a flight. It's like three
round trips from here to Tokyo.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.681
Imagine what
the levels are in there.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.917
Under the dome, in the plant.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.151
Yeah, well, we won't
have to go in there

10:20.153 --> 10:21.319
thanks to old Randy here.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.188
Randy?

10:23.189 --> 10:25.056
Radiation And Nuclear Deployment
Yeoman.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.760
How about Virgil? Virtual
Reality Gyroscopic Laborer.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.062
Howard. Humanoid Out
Wandering About

10:31.064 --> 10:33.064
Radiation Device.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.066
(mock chuckles)
His name's Randy.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.335
Randy it is.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.237
You see that,
out in the distance?

10:39.239 --> 10:42.107
That's Pripyat amusement park.
Grand opening was set

10:42.109 --> 10:44.643
just days
after the meltdown.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.811
The day of the accident
it was actually opened to keep

10:46.813 --> 10:49.280
citizens occupied before the
evacuation orders came through.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.384
That was the only day anyone
could ride the rides.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.386
This whole area's
a ghost town.

10:54.388 --> 10:57.255
I feel like
the Omega Woman. Creepy.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.257
So we make good time.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.693
Never traffic near Chernobyl.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.696
No time to waste.
Is my plane over there.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.931
You're our pilot?

11:06.933 --> 11:09.167
Got license four years ago
to take aerial photograph

11:09.169 --> 11:11.736
of dome, track stability.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.172
You programmed Geiger software,
so you come with me, no?

11:14.174 --> 11:15.991
No.

11:15.992 --> 11:17.809
I barely survived the
commercial jet flight here.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.244
I'm-I'm not
getting in a flying jalopy

11:19.246 --> 11:20.912
with an inexperienced pilot.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.947
I assure you
you're in good hands.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.816
Thank you,
lady I barely know.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.151
But<i> nyet.</i>

11:26.153 --> 11:28.386
Sly, you need to run
the Geiger software.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.822
You programmed it.

11:30.824 --> 11:31.990
I'll go with you.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.191
Besides, you know

11:33.193 --> 11:34.359
you have a job to do
and you never

11:34.361 --> 11:36.194
let the team down.
So all you're doing

11:36.196 --> 11:37.462
is delaying the inevitable,

11:37.464 --> 11:39.230
and every extra second
we spend here,

11:39.232 --> 11:40.965
we're getting more radiation.

11:52.412 --> 11:55.146
Okay, we're at altitude

11:55.148 --> 11:57.449
and are banking back
toward the reactor.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.019
(panting)
We'll be just fine.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.032
There. Perfect.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.972
(beep)

12:23.977 --> 12:26.077
I'm already getting
a readout from you, Sly.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.979
Radiation's heavy up there,
you're not even

12:27.981 --> 12:29.948
over the reactor yet.
There is definitely

12:29.950 --> 12:31.883
a lot of leakage from that dome.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.529
Speaking of the dome,
I'll get through this

12:44.531 --> 12:47.198
rotted mess in no time.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.300
TOBY:
Just keep your distance.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.935
Leakage of the bad stuff's
gonna jump

12:50.937 --> 12:52.520
as you make each hole larger.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.104
Hole's large enough to fit.
Walt.

12:57.778 --> 13:01.279
Good news-- Randy spotted a
large crack in the plant proper.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.814
He can roll right in.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.793
They have lights on in there?

13:14.795 --> 13:16.094
It's a power plant.
No one turned off

13:16.096 --> 13:18.263
the grid when the meltdown
occurred, they just ran.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.464
(thud)

13:19.466 --> 13:20.999
HAPPY:
Careful with Randy.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.167
If you get stuck or fall over,

13:22.169 --> 13:23.301
and, uh, we can't
finish the mission.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.904
I know how to operate
a joystick.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.072
Who has the top five high scores
on<i> Proton Arnold?</i>

13:28.074 --> 13:30.041
And we all know why.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.276
Huh?

13:31.278 --> 13:33.945
Nothing.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.413
TOBY: I don't see the corium. WALTER:
It's in there. We're looking.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.581
Well, how hard should it be
to find something

13:36.583 --> 13:38.867
called the Elephant's Foot?

13:38.868 --> 13:41.152
WALTER: If that's not the
corium, I don't know what is.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.854
Geiger counter's going crazy.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.989
I'm getting
a pretty strong bounce, too.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.125
It's because we're almost right
over dome.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.494
Uh, radiation is affecting
electronics a bit.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.062
It'll affect Randy too, Walt.
Not too close.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.263
WALTER: Well, we have to get
close enough

13:52.265 --> 13:53.464
to get a radiation measurement

13:53.466 --> 13:55.133
from right next to
the Elephant's Foot.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.969
Readouts say the corium's
1,200 degrees.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.438
That's much higher than
the Energy Council estimates.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.940
Well, it's hard to estimate
something when you

14:01.942 --> 14:03.492
haven't seen it in two decades.

14:03.493 --> 14:05.043
It's a miracle anything
is still intact in there.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.078
It's a miracle anyone
could last out here at all.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.047
Look, when the corium
finally formed its shell

14:09.049 --> 14:10.548
and stopped moving,
look what was

14:10.550 --> 14:13.218
just 20 feet away,
on the other side of the plant.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.589
CABE:
What is that thing?

14:17.591 --> 14:19.424
Do you remember when you said
just a fraction of the cesium

14:19.426 --> 14:21.392
in the reactor was
melted down 30 years ago?

14:21.394 --> 14:23.394
Yeah.
That's the rest of it.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.530
And if the corium ever
reaches those cesium rods...

14:25.532 --> 14:27.131
It's another Chernobyl.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.534
Only 32 1/3 times its size.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.470
The death toll alone... HAPPY: Well, that
is not an issue, 'cause the bad stuff

14:32.472 --> 14:34.138
is trapped in the
corium's coating.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.541
So just focused, stay on point,
and don't freak out.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.309
Yeah, Happy's right.
So, we just need to get our data

14:38.311 --> 14:40.979
and then figure out the best
position for the sarcophagus,

14:40.981 --> 14:42.247
then get out of here.
Okay,

14:42.249 --> 14:44.082
I'm moving in to get a reading.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.019
Uh, I don't know
if Randy can take it.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.220
Just extend the arm.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.157
Uh, it burst into flames!

14:53.159 --> 14:55.627
I've lost control of the robot.

14:55.629 --> 14:57.962
Was Randy still moving forward?
If he hits the corium,

14:57.964 --> 14:59.264
he can break through
its outer shell.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.165
Oksana, get the plane
away from the dome now.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.172
The corium's been breached.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.610
I've lost control
of plane!

15:12.612 --> 15:14.178
Hold on.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.663
Whoa.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.147
We're banking hard.
What is going on?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.684
The radiation plume
stopped the engines!

15:20.654 --> 15:23.054
She's prepping to crash land.
Paige.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.055
It's headed this way.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.924
Brace yourself!

15:25.926 --> 15:27.225
(whimpering)

15:27.227 --> 15:29.527
There's not enough time to stop.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.229
(grunting)

15:31.231 --> 15:32.363
This is how I die!

15:49.215 --> 15:51.416
First crash in four years.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.129
Paige, Paige!
Paige, are you okay?

16:05.131 --> 16:06.965
Yes, we're all alive.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.567
Thank God. HAPPY: Okay,
listen, shake the cobwebs.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.702
You have to get
out of there quickly.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.236
You're in
a high-radiation zone.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.238
That's not possible.
They're trapped inside.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.306
Not good.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.409
(all coughing)

16:20.313 --> 16:23.081
SYLVESTER: Be careful. We definitely
jostled the infrastructure.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.016
This place does
not look stable.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.517
Looks like
we can't leave.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.386
(grunts)

16:28.388 --> 16:29.620
That's right.
Until we figure out

16:29.622 --> 16:31.055
a way to get you out of there.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.992
Now, do not get too
close to the corium.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.494
Most of the radiation plume
it sent up exited the dome,

16:36.496 --> 16:38.463
but it's still dangerous,
even though most of the coating

16:38.465 --> 16:39.630
has remained intact.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.499
How do you know
it's remained intact?

16:41.501 --> 16:42.700
If it wasn't,
you'd be dead by now.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.635
There's a giant orange glow

16:44.637 --> 16:46.471
coming from the floor below us.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.339
That could be the corium.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.542
We can peek over railing,
but keep safe distance back.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.718
No sign of Randy.
He was eaten alive.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.754
Are you sure
we're far enough away?

17:02.756 --> 17:05.523
Topeka isn't far enough away.
WALTER: Shut up, Toby.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.493
Now, the threat of radiation
dissipates with

17:08.495 --> 17:10.795
the inverse square
of the distance from the source.

17:10.797 --> 17:14.365
In short, you are not
at fatal exposure levels yet.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.533
HAPPY: Are we forgetting
that the corium

17:15.535 --> 17:17.335
was 20 feet
from the cesium rods?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.636
Now that it's oozing out,
it's gonna get there,

17:18.638 --> 17:20.371
causing Chernobyl times three.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.607
I'm looking at the photo that
Randy sent before he kamikazed

17:22.609 --> 17:24.208
into the Elephant's Foot.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.611
It was just before
the yellow pipe at the time.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.046
Yeah, well,
the glow has now reached

17:28.048 --> 17:29.814
the mid-point
of that yellow pipe.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.083
Okay, math is not my forte,
but rough estimates

17:32.085 --> 17:35.420
give you 40 minutes until the
blob hits the cesium rods.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.289
And then the whole plant-- hell,
the whole town-- goes kablooey.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.390
Actually, 39.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.059
The accuracy's really
appreciated.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.460
You must contact
my colleagues for help.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.728
CABE: I just
got off the horn with them.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.129
They won't even

17:45.131 --> 17:47.165
approach Chernobyl.
They're prepping

17:47.167 --> 17:50.701
for a wide-scale
emergency evac if necessary.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.670
Okay, we got to move faster if
we're gonna clear this in time.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.838
Hey, can you
check your voice mail later?

17:53.840 --> 17:56.207
We have 40 minutes
to move these rocks.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.842
Actually, 38.

17:57.844 --> 17:58.843
Sorry.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.645
The radiation is
blocking signal.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.546
I need to call my husband.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.147
And I need to see my son,

18:03.149 --> 18:05.416
but I won't if you don't
help us. Now get to work.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.687
Walt, get to work!

18:09.689 --> 18:11.689
Quiet, please.
I'm thinking.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.224
Yeah, well, I'm thinking, too.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.258
I'm thinking
our friends are gonna

18:14.260 --> 18:15.660
get blown up in there

18:15.662 --> 18:17.662
if we don't bust that hole open

18:17.664 --> 18:19.864
before some ooze
hits some nuclear rods.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.632
We can't dig them out.
There's too much rubble

18:21.634 --> 18:24.435
and too little manpower.
It's...

18:24.437 --> 18:25.803
Happy?

18:25.805 --> 18:28.106
Yeah? What do you estimate
the weight of the plane is

18:28.108 --> 18:29.740
in its current form?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.210
Uh, undamaged, 1,700 pounds.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.312
In its current state
I'll ballpark 600 pounds,

18:34.314 --> 18:36.681
give or take. And how much
torque do you think we'd need

18:36.683 --> 18:38.149
to pull the plane
out of the rubble?

18:38.151 --> 18:39.283
Why, what are you thinking?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.523
The amusement park.
The amusement park.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.391
Okay, help me pull the end
of that chain to the SUV.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.495
Cabe, grab the battery
from Oksana's car.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.830
What's that
about an amusement park?

18:54.534 --> 18:56.601
Guys, I need you
to focus your work

18:56.603 --> 18:59.537
on removing any of the rubble
near the plane's wheels.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.739
Just the wheels.
Okay. Why?

19:01.741 --> 19:03.875
We're gonna tow you out of there.
SYLVESTER: How? The SUV

19:03.877 --> 19:05.676
doesn't have the capacity.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.618
What?!

19:17.524 --> 19:18.556
This is not happening.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.158
What isn't happening?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.759
'Cause it really sounds
like something is happening.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.361
PAIGE:
An overhead water pipe broke

19:23.363 --> 19:24.762
and it's water
pouring onto the corium.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.297
Really not good.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.866
There is steam coming off
of the Elephant's Foot.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.670
A lot of steam. Okay, guys, I don't
have to tell you how toxic that is.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.456
The space is gonna
steadily fill with that gas.

19:35.457 --> 19:38.241
It's gonna fry your lungs. WALTER: Sly,
you need to find a source of fresh air.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.612
Ha.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.685
I got the emergency
oxygen tanks from the plane.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.388
CABE: That's a genius idea, kid,
but those are small tanks.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.423
There's only about 20 minutes
worth of air in 'em.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.959
Then you have 20 minutes to get us the
heck out of here. CABE: Copy that.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.461
Let's hit it!
Come on, let's go!

19:57.463 --> 19:59.497
(engine starts)

20:00.733 --> 20:03.834
(chain clanking)

20:20.987 --> 20:23.254
(tires screeching)

20:37.737 --> 20:39.403
You ready?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.805
Come on!

20:40.807 --> 20:42.306
I can handle it from here. Go!

20:42.542 --> 20:44.375
Come on! Come on!

20:44.377 --> 20:47.378
Uh, got my work cut out for me.
(engine starts, tires squeal)

20:49.816 --> 20:51.749
Paige, we're less than a minute
away. How are you on oxygen?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.584
Um, half a tank.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.587
It's not lasting
as long as we thought. Hurry!

20:58.524 --> 21:00.258
Okay, you know what?

21:00.260 --> 21:02.026
I tried the tough love
on you, and it didn't work,

21:02.028 --> 21:03.828
so let's try and keep
your mind off things

21:03.830 --> 21:05.463
while we move some rocks. Deal?

21:05.465 --> 21:09.567
Okay. Okay, so,
your-your husband.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.002
How lo-- how long
are you married?

21:11.004 --> 21:13.371
Ten years.
Okay, and where'd you meet?

21:13.373 --> 21:16.040
Uh, work.
Oksana, details.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.575
And I need you
to move a little faster.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.044
There was a manager, Kirman.

21:20.046 --> 21:23.948
He was strong, handsome,
every woman's dream.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.516
He took me dancing,
bought me gifts.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.452
He sounds like a catch.
You're lucky.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.388
Oh, no, I did not marry him.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.290
I married his file clerk,
Nikolai.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.491
Shy as a mouse.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.792
Two men vying for you.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.594
That must have been
a difficult decision.

21:36.596 --> 21:37.862
Oh, not at all.

21:37.864 --> 21:43.034
Nikolai was... awkward,
but he loved me.

21:43.036 --> 21:45.336
He told me
all his flaws,

21:45.338 --> 21:47.805
all the ways
in which we are different,

21:47.807 --> 21:49.874
that we were meant
to be together.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.008
He told me

21:51.010 --> 21:54.912
to have faith that he was right.

21:54.914 --> 21:58.049
And I did, and he was right.

21:58.051 --> 22:00.685
WALTER:
Paige?!

22:00.687 --> 22:02.620
Walter. Yeah.

22:02.621 --> 22:04.554
You need to get back
into the plane!

22:04.557 --> 22:06.023
Happy, how goes it?!

22:06.025 --> 22:08.059
I think these horsies
are ready to run.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.829
Okay.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.066
Here it goes.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.435
(calliope music plays)

22:17.437 --> 22:19.804
It's working!

22:19.806 --> 22:21.505
♪ ♪

22:21.507 --> 22:25.576
(chain jingling)

22:25.578 --> 22:27.128
Okay, guys, buckle in.

22:27.129 --> 22:28.679
This is gonna be
as bumpy as your landing.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.614
Fantastic.

22:30.616 --> 22:33.751
♪ ♪

22:33.753 --> 22:36.554
Chain's pulling.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.955
Back away!

22:38.891 --> 22:40.558
Okay, they're coming out.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.559
(gasping)

22:41.561 --> 22:43.594
Whoa.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.595
What happened? we stopped.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.529
It must be stuck.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.931
But we cleared
the wheel base.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.432
Well, the debris must've shifted
when we started moving.

22:48.434 --> 22:49.500
I'll be right back!

22:49.502 --> 22:50.568
Paige, no!

22:50.570 --> 22:53.504
WALTER:
Paige, what are you doing?

22:53.506 --> 22:57.408
Um, there's a metal sign caught
in the fuselage. I can get it.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.843
CABE:
Be careful, kid.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.328
This rig's pulled tight!

23:00.329 --> 23:01.812
Once you pull that sign,
it's gonna pop like a...

23:01.814 --> 23:03.114
(grunts)

23:08.020 --> 23:09.587
(hissing)

23:09.589 --> 23:11.689
(coughing)

23:13.826 --> 23:15.926
Paige. Paige is still in there!

23:15.928 --> 23:17.828
Paige!

23:17.830 --> 23:18.929
Paige?!

23:18.931 --> 23:19.997
(coughing)
Paige.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.465
Paige, you all right?

23:21.467 --> 23:23.084
Uh, I hurt my knee.
Okay.

23:23.085 --> 23:24.702
Okay, lean on me.
Lean on me. We have to hurry.

23:24.704 --> 23:27.037
The top of the opening
is unstable at best.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.507
(rumbling)

23:29.509 --> 23:32.476
Side of the dome is cracking.
It's caving in!

23:32.478 --> 23:34.912
Down, get down!
Get down!

23:38.551 --> 23:40.551
(panting)

23:40.553 --> 23:44.054
(coughing)

23:44.056 --> 23:46.123
Walter! Paige!

23:50.596 --> 23:53.197
Uh... unfortunately,

23:53.199 --> 23:55.800
the Merry-Go-Round can't
get us out of this one.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.768
We're trapped, aren't we? Yes.

23:57.770 --> 24:02.173
And the oxygen tank only has
ten minutes of air left.

24:02.175 --> 24:04.475
(coughing): There's more
debris here than before.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.877
There's no point wasting our
time trying to get through it.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.913
We can't get out this way.
Um, Walter,

24:08.915 --> 24:11.115
we have a development!

24:11.117 --> 24:13.184
What?

24:15.588 --> 24:17.788
Uh, the wall collapse must've
buckled the cement floor.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.491
The corium is moving faster toward the
nuclear rods. CABE: We already said

24:20.493 --> 24:21.859
that was a bad thing, right?

24:21.860 --> 24:23.226
It'll be Chernobyl 2:
The Sequel.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.663
Nine out of ten sequels are
worse than the original.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.132
Okay, estimating it's about
ten feet from the rods, moving

24:28.134 --> 24:30.234
about a foot a minute. HAPPY:
That would give you a bit more

24:30.236 --> 24:31.936
oxygen than time,
but the point's moot.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.472
We're all in the blast zone,
and we're all dead once the blob

24:34.474 --> 24:35.773
hits the rod. PAIGE: Oh, great.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.576
So no matter what, we
go down with the ship?

24:38.578 --> 24:40.578
Go down with the ship.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.112
That's brilliant!

24:42.114 --> 24:43.948
Happy, we need
to trap the corium!

24:43.950 --> 24:45.182
With what?

24:45.184 --> 24:46.517
Given the size of this thing,

24:46.519 --> 24:48.686
we'd need 30 metric tons
of concrete.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.554
So we take down the whole ship!

24:50.556 --> 24:53.657
Now, in order to seal off
the corium from the rods,

24:53.659 --> 24:55.626
we implode the building
onto itself.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.261
Like the old Tropicana in Vegas.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.129
I cried when that went down.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.898
You know, a showgirl there
made me a man.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.199
(clears throat)

25:02.201 --> 25:03.934
Now, if charges can be
strategically planted,

25:03.936 --> 25:05.870
then we can cause a bulk
of the roof's concrete

25:05.872 --> 25:07.938
to fall on the east side
of the cesium rods,

25:07.940 --> 25:10.574
creating a barrier between them
and the corium.

25:10.576 --> 25:13.077
HAPPY: Okay, we can't do that
until you're out of there.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.578
Being in a collapsing building

25:14.580 --> 25:16.113
isn't exactly good
for your health.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.716
Just properly set the charges
so that the walls and the roof

25:18.718 --> 25:21.151
collapse inward,
creating a temporary tomb,

25:21.153 --> 25:22.953
and we'll figure out a
way to get out of here.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.989
What?! How?

25:24.991 --> 25:27.124
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.093
Where do we get
the explosives from?

25:29.095 --> 25:30.861
Leave that to me. Uh, Toby,

25:30.863 --> 25:32.563
there have been
a million studies on Chernobyl

25:32.565 --> 25:33.597
in the past 30 years.

25:33.599 --> 25:34.798
Find me the schematics

25:34.800 --> 25:36.300
and locate the major
support columns.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.869
Go to Energy Council's
online archives.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.105
All the plans are there.
TOBY: On it!

25:41.107 --> 25:42.306
There could be
some decayed walls in here

25:42.308 --> 25:43.691
that maybe we could

25:43.692 --> 25:45.075
push through
with a broken beam.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.878
Walter?
Mm-hmm.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.113
Beam of sunlight.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.548
Oh, there's a hole
in the dome,

25:50.550 --> 25:51.916
and the light's shining

25:51.917 --> 25:53.283
right through
the plant's broken roof.

25:53.284 --> 25:54.650
You think it's big enough
to squeeze through?

25:54.654 --> 25:55.970
We won't know until
we get up there,

25:55.971 --> 25:57.287
but the, the stairs were
blown out in the meltdown.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.889
I didn't see an elevator.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.991
No, but I see a ladder.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.993
That is not a ladder.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.195
No, it will do.
How's your knee feeling?

26:05.197 --> 26:06.797
Terrible. We don't
have a choice, do we?

26:06.799 --> 26:08.232
No. Come on.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.335
(groaning)

26:25.985 --> 26:27.117
Here's two more.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.019
There gonna be enough fuel?

26:29.021 --> 26:30.888
My tank was full.
Should be plenty.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.089
Doesn't matter
how much fuel we have

26:32.091 --> 26:33.991
if Toby doesn't get me
what I need.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.093
TOBY: I will always
give you what you need,

26:36.095 --> 26:38.729
be it emotional, spiritual
or romantic.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.664
So, here it is, sugar plum.

26:40.666 --> 26:43.100
There are four major
support columns

26:43.102 --> 26:45.302
that abut the exterior walls
of the dome,

26:45.304 --> 26:47.972
and I'm sending you
3-D images now.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.707
Walt, we are prepping
for detonation.

26:49.709 --> 26:52.176
We need a 20 on the corium, but
more importantly, you and Paige!

26:52.178 --> 26:53.978
(grunting)

26:53.980 --> 26:55.112
The corium's five feet away!

26:55.114 --> 26:57.014
It's moving faster
than projected!

26:57.016 --> 27:00.284
As for me and Paige,
we're almost at the top.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.087
Yeah, with only
four minutes of air, and this

27:03.089 --> 27:05.823
climbing's making us
use it faster.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.658
My knee is slowing us down,

27:07.660 --> 27:09.927
so you just go,
and I'll catch up.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.062
No!

27:12.064 --> 27:14.264
We're getting out
of here together!

27:21.374 --> 27:25.976
(groaning)

27:27.179 --> 27:29.179
These are the exact coordinates
Toby gave us.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.214
Here's the wire.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.316
Okay.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.717
Three drums to go.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.352
Okay, let's move!

27:50.102 --> 27:53.203
Keeping your arms out lowers
your center of gravity.

27:53.205 --> 27:57.207
It's-it's why those tightrope
walkers use those poles.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.308
Please don't say "tightrope."

27:58.310 --> 28:01.345
That's okay.
So, we're almost at the end.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.980
We'll be able
to use those ladders

28:02.982 --> 28:04.348
and get outside the dome.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.183
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

28:06.185 --> 28:07.885
Walter! (whimpers)

28:07.887 --> 28:09.953
Oh, God, Walter!

28:13.459 --> 28:16.293
You lost your oxygen! Whatever
you do, do not breathe in!

28:19.999 --> 28:21.465
What's going on?

28:21.467 --> 28:23.200
Walter is hanging from a beam.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.436
He lost his tank,
and he cannot pull himself up!

28:25.438 --> 28:27.805
Of course he can't. His muscles
are deprived of oxygen.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.206
He needs air!

28:29.208 --> 28:31.208
I only have
a few seconds myself.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.910
What do I do?

28:35.981 --> 28:38.348
Okay, we're gonna get
out of here together.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.385
(inhales)

28:43.055 --> 28:44.421
(grunting)

28:44.423 --> 28:47.291
HAPPY:
Paige?

28:47.293 --> 28:48.292
Walt?

28:48.294 --> 28:49.793
I can't hear anything.
Oh, no.

28:49.795 --> 28:52.012
Is that smooching?

28:52.013 --> 28:54.230
Holy CPR-mour. She's kissing
life into the son of a gun.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.369
(grunting)

29:20.826 --> 29:22.526
TOBY: Guys, I know you're
both holding your breath

29:22.528 --> 29:24.428
and you can't answer,
but you'd better move it 'cause

29:24.430 --> 29:26.830
the corium's gonna hit the
rods in less than two minutes!

29:27.967 --> 29:31.769
(loud gasping)

29:31.771 --> 29:33.470
We made it.

29:33.472 --> 29:36.440
Great. Now what? There's no way down.
(groaning)

29:36.442 --> 29:37.975
Actually, there is.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.843
I just didn't mention it
earlier.

29:39.845 --> 29:41.412
'Cause it's borderline insane?

29:41.413 --> 29:42.980
Uh, it goes slightly
beyond the border.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.515
(rumbling)

29:44.517 --> 29:47.117
(panting)
Whoa.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.319
The corium must be eating
into the reactor wall.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.487
Hey, guys, move it or lose it!

29:51.791 --> 29:54.091
Quick.
Come here.

29:54.093 --> 29:57.027
Okay, I noticed that flagpole
when we came in. That and this

29:57.029 --> 29:58.362
extension cord
are our way down.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.264
We just need to find
a cinder block.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.865
Baffled.

30:01.867 --> 30:02.800
Ditto!

30:02.802 --> 30:05.469
Oh. Hold that.
(grunts)

30:05.471 --> 30:07.037
No idea what he's gonna do.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.873
(grunting)

30:09.875 --> 30:11.308
Airplane
battery.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.444
(grunts) All will be
clear in a moment.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.847
HAPPY: That moment better
be less than 90 seconds,

30:16.849 --> 30:18.448
'cause by then I got to implode
that nuke plant

30:18.450 --> 30:19.950
so we can stop
this nuclear Armageddon.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.852
We'll be down
well before then!

30:21.854 --> 30:23.987
Whoa.
Okay. Get in close.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.556
Face-to-face.

30:25.558 --> 30:27.157
Are we just gonna jump?

30:27.159 --> 30:28.859
Sort of. We just need
to pull that chunk

30:28.861 --> 30:31.295
of cement off the roof
and let physics do its thing.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.363
I think I know what he's
gonna do. It could work.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.833
Or they could die.
I can hear you!

30:35.835 --> 30:37.601
Okay, as soon as they're
down, I'll hit the terminal

30:37.603 --> 30:39.570
with the red wire and
down comes the building.

30:39.572 --> 30:41.205
Less than
one minute!

30:41.207 --> 30:42.973
I need you to press
in tighter.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.610
Oh, my God.
This is happening.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.912
We are gonna jump off of here

30:48.914 --> 30:51.281
with an extension cord
to break our fall.

30:51.283 --> 30:53.951
Not just an extension. We also
have the law of conservation

30:53.953 --> 30:55.586
of angular momentum
to help us out.

30:55.588 --> 30:56.887
Okay, done.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.555
35 seconds!
Once I yank

30:58.557 --> 31:00.624
that cement off the roof, things
are gonna happen real fast.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.559
Okay.
Okay, look at me.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.328
Please have faith
that I'm right.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.299
Okay, when I say "now,"
we step off.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.601
I'm just not gonna look.

31:10.603 --> 31:11.468
WALTER:
I think that's wise!

31:11.470 --> 31:12.903
Now!
(shouts)

31:18.143 --> 31:18.942
(shouting)

31:19.912 --> 31:22.446
(panting)
Uh, uh...

31:23.415 --> 31:24.448
(shouts)

31:24.450 --> 31:25.482
WALTER:
Uh...

31:27.620 --> 31:29.553
(both panting)

31:31.557 --> 31:33.924
See? Physics.

31:33.926 --> 31:36.894
Quick! Untie 'em! In Russia, we
have phrase for this kind of trick.

31:36.896 --> 31:40.898
Loose translation,
"bananas crazy"!

31:40.900 --> 31:42.183
HAPPY: Guys, if my
calculations are right,

31:42.184 --> 31:43.467
eight seconds until meltdown.
I got

31:43.469 --> 31:45.553
to flip this flapjack! Hurry!

31:45.554 --> 31:47.638
Optimally, they need to be
400 feet from the implosion.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.139
Then I guess we'll have to be
a little under optimal.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.540
Time's up!

31:53.012 --> 31:54.678
Run!

32:12.698 --> 32:14.998
TOBY:
Guys!

32:15.000 --> 32:18.368
Sound off! Anyone! Please!

32:19.972 --> 32:23.640
(coughing)

32:23.642 --> 32:25.509
(coughs)
We're fine.

32:25.511 --> 32:26.944
Oh. SYLVESTER: Fine

32:26.946 --> 32:28.512
but very dirty.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.480
Did it work? Uh, once
again, if it hadn't,

32:30.482 --> 32:31.815
we'd be dead by now.

32:31.816 --> 32:33.149
We'll give the Energy Council
the placement coordinates

32:33.152 --> 32:34.584
for the sarcophagus
by evening.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.988
But please do us a favor
and have it in place by morning.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.306
Done.

32:39.307 --> 32:40.623
Oh, you know what I
could use right now?

32:40.626 --> 32:43.660
A scalding radiation exposure
shower and an iodine shake?

32:43.662 --> 32:45.062
Took the words right
out of my mouth.

32:45.064 --> 32:48.165
(inhales, coughs)

32:48.167 --> 32:49.733
WALTER:
<i> It's a mixture of parsley,</i>

32:49.735 --> 32:52.602
kale, onions,
which contain vitamins

32:52.604 --> 32:55.505
and free radicals
which will scavenge the...

32:55.507 --> 32:56.974
nuclear radiation

32:56.976 --> 32:58.008
in our bodies.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.142
Doesn't sound too terrible.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.078
And cod.
Oh, boy.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.679
Which is also high in iodine.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.681
Which is necessary.
You didn't get deadly exposure,

33:04.683 --> 33:07.017
but you got the equivalent
of three full body CAT scans

33:07.019 --> 33:08.752
in a day. So bottoms up.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.756
(exhaling rapidly)

33:13.625 --> 33:14.758
Oh, that looks awful.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.426
Painfully gross.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.661
I would be chugging it with you,
but...

33:17.663 --> 33:19.663
since Ralphy and I didn't
go to Chernobyl...

33:19.665 --> 33:22.366
(groans softly)

33:25.104 --> 33:28.038
You better save me a slice
or this goes on your head.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.254
Ask her.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.255
Hmm?

33:45.257 --> 33:46.523
There's...

33:46.525 --> 33:48.025
there's risk involved,

33:48.027 --> 33:49.526
you know?
If it doesn't work...

33:49.528 --> 33:52.062
Sh-She's important to me,
so I can't.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.430
There's risk involved.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.098
You dove off a building
with the woman.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.467
She literally took the plunge
with you.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.771
Physically plummeting does not
correlate to emotional risk.

34:00.773 --> 34:01.772
She kissed life into you.

34:01.774 --> 34:03.707
She was sharing oxygen.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.743
Walter, she trusts you,
you trust her.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.413
That is the basis
of any lasting relationship,

34:09.415 --> 34:10.781
even for people
like us.

34:12.317 --> 34:15.652
You know me. Can you
even calculate the level

34:15.654 --> 34:18.422
of discomfort it brings me to
comment on your personal life?

34:19.491 --> 34:21.358
Okay, I wouldn't do it,

34:21.360 --> 34:23.593
not unless I saw you
doing yourself grave harm.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.398
I'm your friend.
You can trust me.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.667
So believe me
when I say you can trust her.

34:30.669 --> 34:33.270
(shudders) I don't even
know if she likes jazz.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.371
No one likes jazz.

34:34.373 --> 34:35.739
It's about spending
time together.

34:35.741 --> 34:36.807
Ask her.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.814
(phone rings)

34:43.816 --> 34:45.682
Hi. Team Scorpion.
She's on the phone.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.151
Hi...
When she's off.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.257
(Paige speaking
indistinctly)

34:56.762 --> 34:59.763
Hey, big brain.
I'm taking the company car.

35:01.366 --> 35:03.266
Keys, please.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.267
Huh?

35:04.269 --> 35:07.237
W-We don't have a company car.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.738
Your new car is the company car.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.407
We voted. It's really nice.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.541
I need it,
I'm in the company.

35:11.543 --> 35:12.809
Keys, please.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.878
Smell ya later.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.781
Yeah.

35:17.783 --> 35:18.782
Sure.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.151
Okay, bye.

35:24.356 --> 35:25.689
Oh.

35:25.691 --> 35:28.291
Are you-you feeling okay?

35:28.293 --> 35:30.127
Do you need more fish shake?

35:30.129 --> 35:32.395
Oh, no. No, I've had,
I've had plenty.

35:32.397 --> 35:34.264
Uh... uh...

35:34.266 --> 35:37.534
Th-Thank you for, uh, giving me
that breath of air.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.336
Yeah, of course.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.838
And for-for trusting me
to jump off the building.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.443
(whispers):
Just do it.

35:46.445 --> 35:51.681
So, have we ever, uh, discussed
jazz music... before?

35:51.683 --> 35:54.351
'C-Cause, you know, some
people think that it's just...

35:54.353 --> 35:57.888
it's, uh, improvised
chaos. But, actually, uh,

35:57.890 --> 36:02.492
great works c-can be
charted mathematically.

36:02.494 --> 36:06.163
It really helps in
the, uh, appreciation.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.297
I didn't know that.

36:07.299 --> 36:08.865
Why are you bringing this up?

36:08.867 --> 36:10.867
Well, I-I have these tickets...

36:10.869 --> 36:12.202
(phone buzzing)

36:18.911 --> 36:21.444
Oh.

36:21.446 --> 36:22.779
Well, you can take that if you want.
No, no.

36:22.781 --> 36:23.847
I-I can call him back.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.849
You were talking
about those tickets.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.585
Yeah. So, I wanted to, um...

36:28.587 --> 36:32.455
uh, ask if y-you, uh,
would like to go to the...

36:32.457 --> 36:36.526
Lake Tahoe Jazz and
Heritage Festival.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.862
Oh. Um...

36:38.864 --> 36:40.397
I'd...

36:42.367 --> 36:44.467
With-with Tim.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.437
T-Tim?

36:47.439 --> 36:49.773
Yeah. Well, you know, I, um...

36:49.775 --> 36:52.943
I bought them, uh,
to go with Linda,

36:52.945 --> 36:55.612
but, uh, you know, now
that that's defunct,

36:55.614 --> 36:58.715
they're, they're available.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.255
Um...

37:05.257 --> 37:06.523
Okay.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.325
Yeah, I'll...

37:08.327 --> 37:11.928
I'll ask Tim to go, if he wants.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.897
Good.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.966
Enjoy.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.989
Fargas, you're late.

37:38.991 --> 37:42.559
If you wanted prompt, you should
have gone to a regular jeweler.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.295
Regular jeweler wouldn't
take the job. Gimme.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.364
Oh.

37:47.366 --> 37:49.799
FARGAS:
This is no jab at your lady,

37:49.801 --> 37:51.935
but unless she's incarcerated,
you're not gonna get away

37:51.937 --> 37:53.737
with that as a ring.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.272
This is perfect.
She's gonna love it.
