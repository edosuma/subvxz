<i>Previously on "Heartland"$$$</i>

00:04.691 --> 00:07.326
- Renard Perez.
- That was absolutely amazing.

00:07.393 --> 00:08.995
It's an equestrian
show$$$ Dark Horse.

00:09.062 --> 00:10.630
I've read about it.
You're the director, aren't you?

00:10.697 --> 00:13.032
Any university would be
lucky to have you.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.532
You're gonna be
a great vet.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.834
What if it's a waste
of time and money?

00:26.512 --> 00:28.412
He's awake and I think
his breathing's better.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.280
<i>So is he gonna be
all right?</i>

00:30.348 --> 00:31.381
Yeah, I think so.

01:01.111 --> 01:03.145
So you're going?
You have to?

01:03.212 --> 01:05.280
Yeah, you've already talked me
into staying longer

01:05.346 --> 01:07.149
than I intended to.

01:07.216 --> 01:09.084
And I left Shane
with my girlfriend -

01:09.152 --> 01:11.319
she's probably had enough
of babysitting by now.

01:11.387 --> 01:12.788
Yeah. Yeah.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.923
Well, you know, the winter
holidays are coming up,

01:14.991 --> 01:17.358
I was kinda hoping I could
spend some time with Shane.

01:17.426 --> 01:18.893
Oh, Tim, uh...

01:18.960 --> 01:20.427
Well,
half the time with me,

01:20.495 --> 01:22.029
and you could spend
half the time with him,

01:22.097 --> 01:23.931
or you could come.

01:23.999 --> 01:25.833
Hold on, okay?
You're going too fast.

01:25.901 --> 01:27.501
I told you
I would think about

01:27.569 --> 01:28.903
whether or not Shane
can visit.

01:28.970 --> 01:30.705
What?

01:30.772 --> 01:32.372
Yeah, you say you're
back on the wagon

01:32.440 --> 01:33.907
and that's great,
but I...

01:33.974 --> 01:36.242
I have to be absolutely
sure of that before I...

01:36.310 --> 01:38.277
I thought this was about you
and I working this out.

01:38.345 --> 01:41.314
It is, but...

01:43.317 --> 01:45.952
Hi, Sharon.
I'm just leaving.

01:46.020 --> 01:47.053
<i>What?</i>

01:48.189 --> 01:49.455
What do you mean
he's gone?

02:01.717 --> 02:03.718
Come on, Lobo.

02:18.467 --> 02:21.168
You did
an incredible job.

02:22.169 --> 02:24.004
I'm serious.

02:24.071 --> 02:25.938
You know,
Lobo wouldn't have made it

02:25.956 --> 02:28.124
if it wasn't for you.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.092
I'm so proud of you.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.728
Well, thank you.

02:31.795 --> 02:33.363
You're welcome.

02:33.430 --> 02:35.465
You know, I uh...

02:35.532 --> 02:37.066
I couldn't have done it
without you.

02:37.134 --> 02:38.100
Come on...

02:38.168 --> 02:40.034
I couldn't have.

02:44.940 --> 02:45.974
What?

02:49.044 --> 02:51.012
Nothing... nothing.

02:52.482 --> 02:55.449
Where do you think
you'll get accepted?

02:55.517 --> 02:56.584
Well, I've got
my fingers crossed

02:56.652 --> 02:58.452
for the University
of Calgary.

02:59.921 --> 03:02.323
But what if it's the one
in Saskatchewan?

03:02.391 --> 03:04.925
We don't have to worry
about that just yet.

03:04.993 --> 03:06.661
Okay?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.262
I hate this.

03:08.330 --> 03:11.164
You know,
everything is changing again.

03:11.231 --> 03:12.732
And I know how good
you are with that.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.201
Mm-hmm.

03:16.136 --> 03:19.572
Amy, things can't stay
the same forever, right?

03:19.640 --> 03:22.542
Yes they can!
I want them to.

03:24.345 --> 03:25.745
I like this,
just how it is.

03:32.552 --> 03:34.886
Yes, sir, hitchhiking.

03:34.954 --> 03:36.188
It's not against the law,

03:36.255 --> 03:37.856
but it's not a very
smart thing to do.

03:37.924 --> 03:39.090
Well, I'm sorry you had
to come all the way

03:39.158 --> 03:40.693
to Hudson.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.027
Well, I'm glad to do it.

03:42.094 --> 03:44.195
Couldn't very well
leave him out there.

03:44.262 --> 03:45.630
Thank you.

03:45.698 --> 03:48.966
<i>No problem. Take care.</i>

03:53.772 --> 03:55.272
Are you out of your mind?

03:55.341 --> 03:57.208
It was faster
than taking the bus.

03:57.275 --> 03:58.575
Is my mom still here?

04:01.479 --> 04:02.846
Oh my God!

04:08.419 --> 04:09.853
Oh my God!
Shane!

04:11.922 --> 04:14.357
I saw the police car
and I thought...

04:14.424 --> 04:16.058
You almost gave Sharon
a heart attack,

04:16.125 --> 04:18.327
waking up
and finding you gone!

04:18.394 --> 04:19.595
Don't you ever
think?

04:19.663 --> 04:21.464
How could you do
something like that?

04:21.531 --> 04:23.499
The police picked
him up hitchhiking.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.267
What?
Hitchhiking?

04:25.335 --> 04:26.702
What, in the middle
of the night?

04:26.770 --> 04:29.572
Yeah, it's when all
the truckers go through,

04:29.639 --> 04:30.839
and they're pretty cool.

04:30.906 --> 04:32.240
Anyone could have
picked you up!

04:32.307 --> 04:33.575
Anything could have
happened to you!

04:33.642 --> 04:35.510
Yeah, well, it didn't,
did it?

04:35.578 --> 04:36.478
Just relax.

05:38.537 --> 05:40.938
Come on, buddy.
Come on. Come on!

05:44.443 --> 05:45.309
Can I help you?

05:45.376 --> 05:46.310
Amy Fleming?

05:46.377 --> 05:47.778
Yes.

05:47.846 --> 05:49.713
I have something
for you.

05:49.781 --> 05:53.182
Wow, he's beautiful,
but why?

05:53.250 --> 05:55.418
I guess the answer
is in this letter.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.593
It's from Renard.

06:03.661 --> 06:05.094
"Meet Zephyr."

06:05.162 --> 06:06.995
<i>He's a horse with something
to teach you,</i>

06:07.063 --> 06:09.765
<i>and you must teach him
something in return.</i>

06:09.833 --> 06:12.701
"Every dancer
needs a partner."

06:12.769 --> 06:14.135
Weird.

06:14.203 --> 06:15.604
I wonder what
that means?

06:15.672 --> 06:17.138
I don't know.

06:18.107 --> 06:20.308
Hey...

06:20.376 --> 06:21.777
<i>Shane?!</i>

06:21.845 --> 06:24.011
<i>Shane, stop!
Come on!</i>

06:28.049 --> 06:29.350
What is going on
here?

06:31.119 --> 06:33.053
That's weird.

06:33.121 --> 06:35.356
I thought Miranda would've
left this morning.

06:36.324 --> 06:37.959
Oh...
How's all that going?

06:38.026 --> 06:39.158
Don't ask me.

06:39.226 --> 06:41.127
Dad is close-mouthed
about it, as usual.

06:41.195 --> 06:44.030
But he assures me that
he's gonna be very helpful

06:44.098 --> 06:46.199
when we finally do
the big move.

06:46.266 --> 06:47.567
Well, that's very nice of him,
honey,

06:47.635 --> 06:49.669
but I think our move
is still a while away.

06:49.737 --> 06:51.137
Why?

06:51.205 --> 06:52.271
Well, there's a lot of work
to be done on the place,

06:52.339 --> 06:53.607
and knowing you,

06:53.674 --> 06:54.607
you're gonna want it
to be perfect

06:54.674 --> 06:55.908
before we move in.

06:55.976 --> 06:57.075
It doesn't have to be perfect.

06:57.143 --> 06:58.777
I love it
for its imperfections.

06:58.845 --> 07:00.646
Who are you,

07:00.714 --> 07:02.581
and what have you done
with my wife?

07:02.649 --> 07:04.316
Yes, it would've been
nice to move in,

07:04.384 --> 07:06.451
you know,
before our anniversary,

07:06.520 --> 07:07.653
celebrate in
our new home,

07:07.721 --> 07:09.688
but we can do that
next year.

07:09.756 --> 07:11.656
Hey, listen,
speaking of celebrations,

07:11.724 --> 07:13.691
um, I'm gonna do
the anniversary this year,

07:13.759 --> 07:15.326
okay?
So hands off.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.461
What? No!
What're you talking about?

07:17.530 --> 07:18.930
I'm the one who does
the planning, remember?

07:18.998 --> 07:20.899
That's what I do.
There she is!

07:20.966 --> 07:22.099
There's the wife I know
and love.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.635
Hah-hah.

07:23.702 --> 07:24.736
You know, in all seriousness,
honey,

07:24.803 --> 07:26.803
you know,
it's been two crazy years

07:26.871 --> 07:29.540
and you stuck with me
through it all

07:29.607 --> 07:31.474
and it's meant
a lot to me,

07:31.543 --> 07:34.310
and I really wanna
do this.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.682
Okay. I'll try.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.752
You'll do more than try;
You'll do!

07:42.719 --> 07:44.020
Okay?

07:44.087 --> 07:45.120
Okay.

07:47.157 --> 07:49.124
Right, honey?
Right?

07:50.093 --> 07:51.594
I don't believe you!

07:51.662 --> 07:53.695
Why would you
put yourself in danger?

07:53.763 --> 07:54.996
I just did, okay?

07:55.064 --> 07:56.197
That's not good enough!

07:56.265 --> 07:57.999
You think I don't know
what's going on?

07:58.067 --> 07:59.467
<i>Do you think I don't hear you
on the phone</i>

07:59.535 --> 08:01.069
<i>with the lawyers
and with Sharon,</i>

08:01.136 --> 08:03.337
talking about everything?

08:03.405 --> 08:04.906
I knew you were
coming here.

08:04.974 --> 08:06.575
<i>You should've brought me
with you.</i>

08:06.642 --> 08:08.309
<i>I just want...</i>

08:09.277 --> 08:10.310
What? What?

08:10.378 --> 08:11.745
What do you want,
Shane?

08:11.813 --> 08:13.814
I don't know!
I don't know what I want!

08:13.882 --> 08:15.883
But I know I don't want it
like this, okay?

08:18.152 --> 08:19.252
Come on, Pal.

08:23.391 --> 08:24.524
Just let him go.

08:26.827 --> 08:27.927
I'll go talk to him.

08:27.995 --> 08:30.630
No, let me do it.
I'll get Harley.

08:39.907 --> 08:41.539
Hey, what's up?

08:45.945 --> 08:48.213
How old are you,
thirteen, fourteen?

08:48.280 --> 08:49.214
I'm twelve.

08:49.281 --> 08:51.516
Twelve...

08:51.584 --> 08:54.953
Yeah, I was getting in
a lot fights at your age,

08:55.021 --> 08:58.055
stayed away from home
as much as I could,

08:58.123 --> 09:00.257
flunked out of school.

09:01.159 --> 09:02.226
It took me a long time
to realize

09:02.293 --> 09:05.696
I had to stop
doing the crazy stuff.

09:05.764 --> 09:08.298
Luckily,
I ended up here.

09:09.567 --> 09:12.202
This place saved my life.

09:13.370 --> 09:14.738
You gotta find your place,
Shane.

09:16.674 --> 09:19.275
You know, I...
I think I already have.

09:20.611 --> 09:23.113
Well, then you gotta
fight for it.

09:23.180 --> 09:23.947
<i>But they're not gonna
take you seriously</i>

09:24.015 --> 09:26.750
<i>if you keep running off.</i>

09:26.817 --> 09:29.284
You gotta talk to them,
face to face.

09:29.352 --> 09:31.987
<i>Just tell them
where you're at.</i>

09:32.055 --> 09:34.456
They'll listen to you,
trust me.

09:47.335 --> 09:50.638
All right, Zephyr,
let's see what you can do.

09:50.706 --> 09:51.739
Hmm?

10:05.920 --> 10:06.953
Good boy!

10:19.365 --> 10:20.399
Good boy!

10:21.634 --> 10:24.369
Well, look at you!

10:28.041 --> 10:29.108
<i>So this new horse, Zephyr,</i>

10:29.676 --> 10:31.243
he's absolutely amazing.

10:31.311 --> 10:33.011
He's totally trained
to voice signals

10:33.079 --> 10:34.412
and body language,

10:34.479 --> 10:36.280
and I'd actually love
to show you, Shane.

10:36.348 --> 10:38.082
You should come by
in the morning.

10:38.149 --> 10:39.450
Oh, there won't
be time for that.

10:39.518 --> 10:41.018
I'm afraid we have
to leave;

10:41.086 --> 10:42.119
Shane has school.

10:43.689 --> 10:45.022
Yeah, I'm not going.

10:45.090 --> 10:46.090
Yes, you are.

10:46.157 --> 10:48.125
No. No, I'm not.

10:50.595 --> 10:52.529
Shane,
get back here.

10:52.597 --> 10:54.564
<i>No, you just don't get it.</i>

10:54.632 --> 10:56.933
This isn't just about
you and dad.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.569
You remember this?
Yeah, that's my stone.

10:59.637 --> 11:01.003
I'm part of this family,

11:01.071 --> 11:02.572
<i>so I should be
part of this decision.</i>

11:02.640 --> 11:04.140
Come back
to the table.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.474
No!
I'm sick of you being stressed out

11:05.542 --> 11:07.876
about lawyers
that we can't even afford.

11:07.944 --> 11:09.745
It's more complicated
than that, Shane.

11:09.812 --> 11:11.647
Your mother and I
are working it out.

11:11.715 --> 11:13.382
You're making all of these
decisions without me!

11:13.450 --> 11:16.151
It's not fair!
You just never listen.

11:16.219 --> 11:18.186
Okay, all right,
what do you want?

11:18.255 --> 11:19.655
I wanna know that I can
come and visit here

11:19.723 --> 11:21.123
whenever I want to.

11:22.224 --> 11:25.493
And I just want you guys
to get along;

11:25.561 --> 11:26.694
To be friends.

11:26.762 --> 11:29.564
<i>Why can't you do that?!</i>

11:38.773 --> 11:40.940
<i>Shane, wait!</i>

11:43.745 --> 11:44.778
Miranda!

11:52.820 --> 11:55.621
Just...
Just hear me out here.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.391
I should never have
started this -

11:58.458 --> 12:01.927
this custody thing -
in the first place.

12:01.995 --> 12:03.028
It's upset your life
completely

12:03.096 --> 12:05.698
and I just...
I don't wanna go there.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.200
So I'm giving it up.
I'm walking away.

12:08.268 --> 12:10.602
No. No, don't.

12:10.670 --> 12:12.137
- Yeah.
- No.

12:12.205 --> 12:13.405
Maybe Shane's right.

12:13.472 --> 12:17.042
Maybe we should stay
a few more days and...

12:17.110 --> 12:18.677
Spend some time
together.

12:18.744 --> 12:20.545
You know,
the three of us.

12:21.580 --> 12:25.150
And Shane is right
about something else;

12:25.218 --> 12:28.352
I can't afford
these lawyers, Tim,

12:28.420 --> 12:32.223
so how 'bout we get rid
of them.

12:33.292 --> 12:34.225
No lawyers.

12:34.293 --> 12:35.526
No lawyers.

12:35.593 --> 12:37.094
Oh yeah.

12:37.162 --> 12:39.163
No, we can work this out
together.

12:39.231 --> 12:40.965
Yeah.
And who knows?

12:41.033 --> 12:42.699
Maybe without them
stirring the pot,

12:42.766 --> 12:46.236
we can be...
Just like Shane said,

12:46.304 --> 12:48.738
we can be friends.

12:49.773 --> 12:52.809
Okay... okay.

12:55.713 --> 12:57.247
Good night.

12:57.315 --> 12:58.747
Good night.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.458
I wish I was there.

13:09.525 --> 13:11.093
No, I'm not just saying that!

13:11.161 --> 13:12.427
I... I miss you.

13:14.330 --> 13:16.064
Okay,
I'll call you later.

13:16.131 --> 13:19.133
Hey! I love you.

13:21.237 --> 13:24.072
Lisa, in France,
with her ex -

13:24.139 --> 13:25.506
how does that feel?

13:25.574 --> 13:27.441
Well, not too great.

13:27.509 --> 13:29.410
So uh...
Why don't you go?

13:29.478 --> 13:31.011
Just hop on a plane
and go.

13:31.079 --> 13:33.013
No. I'm too busy.

13:33.081 --> 13:37.150
I got winterizing to do
and my truck needs...

13:37.218 --> 13:39.486
And Shane and your dad,
that situation...

13:39.553 --> 13:41.255
You are a total coward.

13:41.322 --> 13:44.224
I have never been a coward
in my entire life.

13:44.292 --> 13:46.158
The reason you are not
going on this trip

13:46.226 --> 13:47.360
is because you're scared.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.861
Pfft!
Scared of what?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.696
Well, let's see...
Commitment, flying,

13:50.764 --> 13:51.730
vulnerability.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.099
I am not.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.334
Grandpa, just buy
a ticket to Paris.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.669
That is my advice
to you!

14:00.740 --> 14:02.107
Just do it!

14:03.943 --> 14:07.512
Hey, uh, what did
you say to Shane?

14:07.579 --> 14:10.548
I saw that look
you guys had.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.452
I told him that this place
saved my life,

14:14.520 --> 14:16.187
and so did you.

14:18.456 --> 14:20.925
Amy, there's something
I wanna tell you.

14:20.992 --> 14:22.226
Okay...

14:22.294 --> 14:23.727
Well, I um...

14:25.730 --> 14:27.497
I see us doing
a lot together

14:27.565 --> 14:30.200
and I can't imagine
being anywhere else

14:30.268 --> 14:32.202
but here with you.

14:34.138 --> 14:35.838
I love you.

14:35.906 --> 14:37.173
I love you, too.

14:37.241 --> 14:39.575
And I don't wanna
lose you.

14:39.643 --> 14:41.010
You won't!

14:53.889 --> 14:55.123
I'll see you.

14:55.191 --> 14:56.624
Good night.

15:24.227 --> 15:25.496
<i>So I was trying to think of</i>

15:25.564 --> 15:26.798
what to get you
for our anniversary,

15:26.866 --> 15:28.665
but um...

15:28.733 --> 15:30.234
You know, since I don't know
what we're doing,

15:30.302 --> 15:31.469
I couldn't really think

15:31.536 --> 15:32.703
of what an appropriate theme
would be,

15:32.770 --> 15:33.737
so I thought maybe
you could just like

15:33.805 --> 15:36.040
give me a little... hint?

15:37.009 --> 15:38.309
No.

15:38.377 --> 15:40.077
Honey, please?

15:40.145 --> 15:41.045
I need to know
what we're doing

15:41.113 --> 15:42.380
so I can prepare.

15:42.447 --> 15:45.048
I mean, I don't even
know what to wear.

15:45.116 --> 15:46.682
I think that you should
just relax

15:46.750 --> 15:47.683
and go with the flow.

15:47.751 --> 15:49.119
I went to business school.

15:49.186 --> 15:50.086
Going with the flow
is not exactly something

15:50.154 --> 15:51.687
they teach there.

15:51.755 --> 15:53.256
Can I just have
a little hint?

15:53.324 --> 15:55.225
Just like... little?

15:55.292 --> 15:56.226
Nope.

15:56.293 --> 15:57.227
Honey!

15:58.729 --> 16:00.262
- Please?
- No!

16:12.142 --> 16:13.575
Good boy, Zephyr.

16:16.678 --> 16:18.312
Good boy.

16:23.685 --> 16:25.486
Come on,
you can do better!

16:25.554 --> 16:26.587
Come on!

16:35.697 --> 16:36.697
Spartan?

16:39.300 --> 16:40.634
You wanna come and play?

16:47.275 --> 16:48.308
Good boys!

16:59.987 --> 17:00.920
Good boy!

17:04.691 --> 17:05.590
Here!

17:21.439 --> 17:22.439
Good boys.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.742
Good.

17:41.826 --> 17:45.662
Hey, Lis.
So I'm leaving another message.

17:45.730 --> 17:48.364
Guess you must be
out and about.

17:48.432 --> 17:51.300
Just wanted to tell you
that I'm thinking about you

17:51.368 --> 17:54.169
and hope all's well
and uh...

17:54.838 --> 17:57.472
<i>Well, I'm hanging up now.</i>

17:57.540 --> 18:00.509
Hey, so don't you have
your own groceries yet?

18:02.812 --> 18:04.212
Hey, Amy's out there
doing some great work

18:04.280 --> 18:06.548
with that new horse.

18:06.616 --> 18:07.983
Hey, uh...

18:08.051 --> 18:10.852
What do you think
of this Renard guy?

18:10.919 --> 18:12.386
I don't know.
I never really met him, so...

18:12.454 --> 18:14.255
Doesn't it seem
kinda strange,

18:14.322 --> 18:16.891
he drops off
this big fancy horse

18:16.959 --> 18:18.492
out of nowhere?

18:18.560 --> 18:19.927
Well, I mean, the guy dances
with horses for a living,

18:19.995 --> 18:21.963
so he's gotta be
a little eccentric, right?

18:22.031 --> 18:23.898
Yeah, well...

18:23.966 --> 18:25.666
Hey, Jack, um...

18:25.733 --> 18:27.034
Do you have a minute?

18:27.101 --> 18:29.302
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

18:31.039 --> 18:32.072
Just...

18:33.374 --> 18:35.042
Hello.

18:35.109 --> 18:36.143
Lisa!

18:37.645 --> 18:41.647
Oh, no need to apologize.
I know you're busy.

18:42.615 --> 18:45.617
Oh, you can talk?
Well, that's great!

18:45.686 --> 18:46.786
That's great.

18:48.621 --> 18:50.489
Five-course dinner?

18:50.557 --> 18:52.457
Oh, right.

18:52.525 --> 18:53.893
It's nighttime there.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.995
♪

19:01.500 --> 19:03.100
♪

19:15.613 --> 19:17.213
♪

19:30.460 --> 19:32.394
Renard,
what are you doing here?

19:32.462 --> 19:33.863
Watching you

19:33.931 --> 19:35.364
and the progress
you've made!

19:35.432 --> 19:36.766
Quite impressive.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.701
Thank you so much
for Zephyr.

19:38.769 --> 19:40.669
He is amazing.

19:40.738 --> 19:42.839
So you figured out
my little riddle.

19:42.906 --> 19:44.573
I thought you would.

19:45.775 --> 19:47.342
I'm really glad
you're here.

19:47.409 --> 19:48.777
I actually want you
to meet my family.

19:48.845 --> 19:50.746
I think that's
a very good idea,

19:50.813 --> 19:53.581
because I have
a proposition for you.

19:53.649 --> 19:55.851
Hello, Zephyr.

19:59.511 --> 20:02.712
So you must know how talented
Amy is with liberty work.

20:02.780 --> 20:05.081
Well, actually,
they haven't seen much.

20:05.148 --> 20:07.583
<i>I've been doing it
mostly in private.</i>

20:07.650 --> 20:08.784
Well, maybe it's time
you show them

20:08.851 --> 20:10.552
what you can do.

20:10.620 --> 20:13.087
I told Amy I have
a proposal for her.

20:13.154 --> 20:15.790
I'd like her to audition
for Dark Horse.

20:15.857 --> 20:17.558
<i>We've been recruiting</i>

20:17.626 --> 20:18.893
and I think she has
the potential

20:18.961 --> 20:20.327
to be a part
of the show.

20:20.395 --> 20:21.528
Really.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.664
And what exactly
would that entail?

20:23.732 --> 20:25.532
It would mean
some travelling.

20:25.601 --> 20:26.834
We're making stops

20:26.902 --> 20:28.868
in all the major cities
in North America

20:28.936 --> 20:31.304
<i>over the spring and summer,</i>

20:31.371 --> 20:33.506
and next year we're planning
a European tour.

20:33.574 --> 20:35.842
Oh my God, Amy...

20:35.910 --> 20:37.410
Well, I knew you
were working with Spartan,

20:37.478 --> 20:39.145
but I didn't know
you were thinking about this

20:39.213 --> 20:41.180
as a career.

20:41.248 --> 20:42.949
Well, I wasn't really,
but...

20:43.017 --> 20:44.850
This could be
pretty interesting.

20:44.918 --> 20:47.319
I think your granddaughter
needs to take her time

20:47.386 --> 20:48.520
to think about it.

20:48.588 --> 20:50.355
It's a huge commitment,

20:50.423 --> 20:52.858
and before either of us
makes that commitment,

20:52.926 --> 20:54.559
here's what I suggest.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.629
I have a rehearsal space nearby.

20:56.696 --> 20:59.031
<i>I want you to do
a bit of a performance,</i>

20:59.099 --> 21:00.632
for me,
and, of course,

21:00.699 --> 21:03.034
if you'd like your family
to be there.

21:03.102 --> 21:05.402
So... I'll say goodbye now.

21:05.470 --> 21:07.171
It was lovely
to meet you all.

21:07.239 --> 21:08.272
Lovely to meet you
as well.

21:11.409 --> 21:12.110
Thank you.

21:17.815 --> 21:19.182
Oh, honey, I...

21:19.250 --> 21:22.819
I just found this amazing hotel
outside of Banff.

21:23.337 --> 21:24.837
It's five-stars.

21:24.905 --> 21:28.040
All the rooms have fireplaces
and their own hot tub,

21:28.109 --> 21:30.009
and it's on the side
of a mountain.

21:30.077 --> 21:32.545
It looks amazing.

21:32.613 --> 21:34.379
Are you kidding me?

21:34.447 --> 21:36.448
<i>I told you,
i'm planning this.</i>

21:36.516 --> 21:38.150
<i>Can you just control yourself,
please?</i>

21:38.218 --> 21:39.551
Okay.

21:39.619 --> 21:40.919
What's in the bags?

21:40.987 --> 21:43.522
None of your business
what's in the bags.

21:43.590 --> 21:44.956
You know,
for the second anniversary,

21:45.024 --> 21:46.891
you're traditionally supposed
to give paper, right?

21:46.959 --> 21:48.893
I'm not really sure
what that means, but...

21:48.961 --> 21:50.928
<i>Let it go, Lou!</i>

21:50.996 --> 21:53.231
I think Peter is actually
trying to drive me crazy.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.434
He's not letting you in
on his secrets, huh?

21:56.502 --> 21:58.702
Did you buy that
ticket to Paris yet?

22:04.226 --> 22:06.126
Hey! Hey, that one's perfect.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.895
Yeah?
You think?

22:08.863 --> 22:10.163
Ungh! Ow!

22:15.270 --> 22:16.403
Hey, we can finish
the monopoly game

22:16.470 --> 22:17.404
after dinner,
if you want.

22:17.471 --> 22:18.906
Ah, I don't know
about monopoly.

22:18.973 --> 22:20.707
It kinda gets me
riled up.

22:20.775 --> 22:22.108
Why,
'cause you're losing?

22:22.175 --> 22:23.475
No 'cause I don't like
indoor games.

22:25.279 --> 22:27.579
Hey, are you still
mad at me for coming here?

22:27.647 --> 22:29.681
No. No, I'm not mad at you.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.450
Do you have any idea
what my father would've done

22:31.518 --> 22:34.753
if I'd have pulled
a stunt like that?

22:34.821 --> 22:35.955
Hey...

22:36.023 --> 22:37.289
Just don't do it again,
okay?

22:38.257 --> 22:39.791
Ow! Jeez! Come on.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.030
<i>You're dangerous
with those sticks.</i>

22:53.972 --> 22:55.472
Oh, I thought
you'd gone home.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.907
It's pretty late.

22:56.975 --> 22:58.442
I was about to,
but then I saw the lights on

22:58.509 --> 23:01.178
in the living room here.

23:01.246 --> 23:03.647
Is, uh, is Amy asleep,
or...?

23:03.714 --> 23:05.782
Turned in some time ago,

23:05.850 --> 23:08.885
probably with that damn dog
laying at the end of her bed.

23:10.854 --> 23:12.521
Hey, Jack, there's...
There's something

23:12.589 --> 23:14.390
I wanted to talk
to you about.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.225
Shoot!

23:16.293 --> 23:18.094
Um, I know that when
I first got to Heartland,

23:18.162 --> 23:20.830
you said stay away
from your granddaughters

23:20.897 --> 23:22.165
or you'd kick me off
the property.

23:22.232 --> 23:24.100
As I recall,

23:24.168 --> 23:27.035
I told you any part of you
that got too close to 'em

23:27.103 --> 23:30.405
would be removed.

23:30.473 --> 23:31.539
That's right,
I remember that...

23:31.607 --> 23:33.608
That part, yeah.

23:33.676 --> 23:36.411
Um, well, things have
changed since then.

23:36.479 --> 23:39.114
You know,
I feel I've changed.

23:39.182 --> 23:40.615
Yes, you have.

23:40.683 --> 23:44.218
Um... you remember
the plane crash?

23:44.286 --> 23:45.953
Yeah.

23:46.021 --> 23:49.423
Well, it made me realize
that life is short.

23:49.491 --> 23:51.125
And after it,

23:51.193 --> 23:53.494
I sort of was doing
some searching,

23:53.561 --> 23:55.963
trying to find out
who I was.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.401
And then this bike thing,

24:01.469 --> 24:04.337
um, it was different.

24:04.405 --> 24:06.873
All I could think
about was Amy,

24:06.940 --> 24:10.310
and wanting,
needing to find her.

24:10.378 --> 24:12.178
Not me, just her.

24:13.579 --> 24:17.216
<i>I guess what I'm trying
to say is um...</i>

24:17.283 --> 24:20.785
I want your permission
to ask her to marry me.

24:22.555 --> 24:25.257
I'm gonna ask Tim,
as well, obviously.

24:25.325 --> 24:28.593
I just, uh, I wanted
to talk to you first.

24:30.462 --> 24:33.097
Well, I'm flattered
to be asked.

24:34.866 --> 24:37.801
You know how highly
I think of you.

24:39.104 --> 24:41.639
Sometimes it takes
an experience

24:41.706 --> 24:43.141
<i>like the one
we went through</i>

24:43.208 --> 24:46.543
to tell you where
your heart really lies.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.513
And I promise you, Jack,

24:49.580 --> 24:52.015
that I will take care
of her.

24:52.083 --> 24:54.817
This is a commitment
I wanna make.

24:54.885 --> 24:56.453
It's really important
to me.

25:02.693 --> 25:04.060
So uh...?

25:08.265 --> 25:10.667
This wouldn't have anything
to do with the possibility

25:10.734 --> 25:14.437
that Amy might take that Renard
up on his offer?

25:16.440 --> 25:18.106
I'm just saying.

25:18.174 --> 25:22.243
I know you love her;
I've known it for years.

25:22.811 --> 25:26.481
I just don't want you jumping
into something that's...

25:27.149 --> 25:29.484
Well, for the wrong reason.

25:30.519 --> 25:31.553
No, I'm not.

25:33.289 --> 25:35.022
I wanna marry Amy,

25:35.090 --> 25:36.857
and it's for all
the right reasons.

25:50.053 --> 25:52.455
Ungh... sorry.

25:53.403 --> 25:55.805
Honey, are you sure you don't
need the truck this afternoon?

25:55.873 --> 25:56.906
I gotta run an errand.

25:56.974 --> 25:58.074
No. Go ahead.

26:01.011 --> 26:04.546
So Lobo just got a
clean bill of health,

26:04.614 --> 26:06.848
and Scott couldn't say
enough good things.

26:06.916 --> 26:07.916
<i>He's doing much better.</i>

26:07.984 --> 26:09.250
Good. That's good.

26:10.219 --> 26:12.187
And how're you two doing?

26:12.254 --> 26:13.154
- We're fine.
- Good, yeah.

26:13.222 --> 26:14.690
Yeah, actually,

26:14.757 --> 26:17.392
I have an announcement
to make.

26:20.228 --> 26:21.829
<i>It's a little scary,</i>

26:21.897 --> 26:23.197
but in a good way,
right?

26:23.264 --> 26:24.231
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:27.034 --> 26:29.435
I agreed to audition
for Dark Horse,

26:29.503 --> 26:32.271
and I want you all there,
tomorrow afternoon.

26:32.339 --> 26:34.207
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

26:38.378 --> 26:39.713
What?

26:39.780 --> 26:41.748
Nothing.

26:41.816 --> 26:44.950
Um, I'm gonna head over
to the arena with Renard.

26:45.018 --> 26:46.151
Do you mind bringing
the horses over later?

26:46.219 --> 26:47.252
Yeah, I'll hook up
the trailer.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.988
Okay.
Lobo, let's go.

26:49.055 --> 26:50.255
See ya.

26:50.323 --> 26:51.356
Yeah.

26:54.260 --> 26:55.861
Is it nothing?

26:55.929 --> 26:57.029
See, I think I know

26:57.097 --> 26:58.796
the same nothing
that you know

26:58.864 --> 27:00.632
and I don't think
it's nothing.

27:00.699 --> 27:03.001
I think it's anything
but nothing.

27:03.068 --> 27:05.036
Well, you're not gonna say
nothing about it.

27:05.104 --> 27:06.971
Just 'cause you think
nothing is something,

27:07.039 --> 27:08.906
doesn't make something
out of nothing.

27:08.974 --> 27:11.275
Get my drift?

27:13.746 --> 27:16.913
Hey!
So... exciting news!

27:16.981 --> 27:19.983
Not quite what I was expecting,
but...

27:20.952 --> 27:22.619
Okay,

27:22.687 --> 27:24.454
I know!

27:24.522 --> 27:27.423
I heard you and Grandpa
talking last night, so...

27:27.491 --> 27:29.059
I know!

27:29.127 --> 27:30.560
- You know...?
- Yeah!

27:30.628 --> 27:32.294
And I'm so excited
for you guys!

27:32.362 --> 27:33.896
I think it is
the best news!

27:34.064 --> 27:36.198
Okay, you do know.

27:36.266 --> 27:37.533
Well, I haven't asked her yet

27:37.600 --> 27:39.401
because after that talk
with Jack last night,

27:39.469 --> 27:40.435
I'm not so sure-

27:40.503 --> 27:41.971
No, no, no.
Ty, don't be silly.

27:42.039 --> 27:43.372
Don't listen to Grandpa.

27:43.439 --> 27:45.141
You and Amy
are meant to be.

27:45.208 --> 27:46.908
I don't want her to feel like
I'm holding her back,

27:46.976 --> 27:48.242
or to think that that's why
I'm asking her -

27:48.310 --> 27:49.577
'cause I don't want her
to go.

27:49.645 --> 27:51.079
She won't think that.
She'd never think that.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.613
I've had the ring
for months -

27:52.682 --> 27:54.282
I bought it right after
my motorcycle accident,

27:54.349 --> 27:55.917
and it's been burning a hole
in my pocket ever since.

27:55.985 --> 27:57.385
That is so romantic!

27:57.452 --> 27:59.220
And now this opportunity
has come up for her

27:59.288 --> 28:00.521
and it's great,

28:00.589 --> 28:01.656
but it makes it look like
I'm only asking her

28:01.724 --> 28:02.756
'cause I don't want her
to go.

28:02.824 --> 28:03.991
No, it doesn't!

28:04.059 --> 28:05.125
It doesn't look
like that at all.

28:05.193 --> 28:08.062
It won't!
Just, Ty...

28:08.129 --> 28:10.064
You can't control
everything, okay?

28:10.131 --> 28:11.598
Trust me, I know.

28:11.666 --> 28:13.233
So bad timing, yeah -

28:13.301 --> 28:14.434
nothing you can do
about that -

28:14.502 --> 28:18.038
but Ty, just trust your gut
and trust Amy.

28:18.106 --> 28:21.607
Just ask her
and let her decide.

28:21.675 --> 28:24.276
Maybe...
Really? You think?

28:24.344 --> 28:27.379
God, you're so cute!
You guys!

28:27.447 --> 28:29.048
Hey! How great
would it be

28:29.116 --> 28:30.316
if you proposed to her
tomorrow,

28:30.383 --> 28:31.784
right after the performance?!

28:31.852 --> 28:33.385
'Cause then we would like
share an anniversary...

28:33.453 --> 28:34.520
Sort of.

28:34.588 --> 28:35.787
But we could celebrate
together!

28:35.855 --> 28:39.557
Lou, what was it you said
about taking control?

28:39.625 --> 28:41.259
Right. Right.

29:02.947 --> 29:03.914
That should do it.

29:03.981 --> 29:05.882
Thanks.

29:05.950 --> 29:07.651
He's out
like a light.

29:11.388 --> 29:14.691
It's been a nice...
Couple of days.

29:16.093 --> 29:17.126
Yup.

29:18.362 --> 29:19.896
He's a good boy.

29:20.865 --> 29:21.831
Yeah.

29:23.967 --> 29:26.735
He has a lot of you
in him.

29:33.309 --> 29:36.344
So, um,
how's the girlfriend?

29:36.412 --> 29:37.446
Ended.

29:38.548 --> 29:40.081
Oh.

29:40.916 --> 29:43.084
I hope it didn't have anything
to do with all of this.

29:43.151 --> 29:44.786
- I mean-
- No.

29:44.853 --> 29:46.387
It wasn't meant to be.

29:57.665 --> 29:59.299
I'm sorry.
I'm...

30:01.035 --> 30:02.603
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
you should go.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.370
You should go.

30:22.756 --> 30:25.024

<i>Well done, honey!</i>

33:58.148 --> 34:00.583
So you answered any questions

34:00.584 --> 34:02.819
I have about
your abilities.

34:02.887 --> 34:05.088
I hope you accept
my offer.

34:05.156 --> 34:07.723
Can I take a little
longer to decide?

34:07.791 --> 34:08.757
Fair enough.

34:08.775 --> 34:09.909
But I have to warn you,

34:09.976 --> 34:11.577
we are recruiting
all over the country.

34:11.645 --> 34:13.312
Okay.

34:13.380 --> 34:15.014
And, Renard,
I wanna thank you.

34:15.081 --> 34:17.784
I mean, this has been
an amazing experience,

34:17.851 --> 34:19.952
and getting to work
with both horses at once

34:20.020 --> 34:21.853
was incredible.

34:21.922 --> 34:24.156
I really learned a lot.

34:24.223 --> 34:25.123
You know,
I think it'll help me

34:25.190 --> 34:26.591
with what I do.

34:26.659 --> 34:28.426
With what you do?

34:28.494 --> 34:30.360
Yeah.

34:30.429 --> 34:31.963
What is that?

34:32.031 --> 34:35.667
Well, I don't perform.

34:35.734 --> 34:37.534
You know,
I'm not an entertainer.

34:37.603 --> 34:39.503
I don't live
to be on the stage.

34:40.839 --> 34:44.408
I work with horses
who need my help,

34:44.475 --> 34:48.545
and I think that's
what I'm meant to do.

34:48.612 --> 34:51.248
You know,
you once told me

34:51.315 --> 34:54.217
that you have to let go
before you can move forward,

34:54.286 --> 34:55.885
and I'm not sure
I'm ready

34:55.953 --> 34:58.721
to let go
of what I do yet.

34:59.924 --> 35:03.259
Actually, you know...
I am sure.

35:04.228 --> 35:08.698
I really am flattered
at this opportunity,

35:08.765 --> 35:11.399
but I'm gonna have
to say no.

35:12.368 --> 35:14.303
All right.

35:14.370 --> 35:18.340
I'd be lying if I said
I was happy about this,

35:18.407 --> 35:20.642
but I totally understand,

35:21.577 --> 35:23.378
and I respect that
at your young age,

35:23.446 --> 35:26.848
you already have a feel
about your calling.

35:26.915 --> 35:28.549
I really wanna
thank you.

35:28.616 --> 35:31.052
I'll never forget this.

35:32.187 --> 35:33.287
Good luck.

35:41.796 --> 35:42.963
You going somewhere?

35:43.030 --> 35:44.731
Yeah,

35:44.798 --> 35:45.899
as a matter of fact,
I am.

35:45.967 --> 35:47.000
Paris.

35:48.669 --> 35:50.370
There's...

35:50.437 --> 35:52.805
There's someone there
I want to see.

35:52.874 --> 35:54.507
Wow!

35:56.510 --> 36:00.545
By the way,
the answer is yes.

36:02.916 --> 36:04.416
Really?

36:04.484 --> 36:05.517
Yeah.

36:06.186 --> 36:08.087
Thank you, Jack.

36:11.191 --> 36:12.224
Okay.

36:13.894 --> 36:14.993
<i>Can you believe Peter?</i>

36:15.060 --> 36:16.327
He has completely
disappeared

36:16.395 --> 36:18.829
and I still can't get
a hold of him.

36:18.898 --> 36:20.431
Where are you going?

36:22.268 --> 36:24.802
You're not?!

36:24.870 --> 36:27.071
Oh! Grandpa!

36:28.040 --> 36:30.641
I am so proud of you.

36:30.709 --> 36:34.011
This is for you.
It's from Peter.

36:41.619 --> 36:44.254
Happy anniversary,
honey.

36:50.760 --> 36:51.794
Okay.

36:53.530 --> 36:55.464
Ungh! Thank you.

36:58.368 --> 37:00.236
Give Amy a hug for me.

37:06.475 --> 37:08.143
<i>All right.</i>

37:13.715 --> 37:14.749
Tally-ho!

37:25.009 --> 37:26.243
There you go.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.044
I know you can probably
light your own fire,

37:28.112 --> 37:29.145
but I just wanted
to make sure

37:29.214 --> 37:30.714
everything was okay
for the night.

37:30.781 --> 37:31.748
Thanks

37:31.816 --> 37:33.217
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.484
Hey, Tim?

37:38.121 --> 37:41.724
You win;
Shane can visit anytime.

37:41.791 --> 37:44.327
Okay... that's great.
That's great.

37:44.394 --> 37:45.528
I'm not sure about
the "I win" part;

37:45.596 --> 37:48.364
That implies that you lost.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.099
Well, I haven't lost,

37:50.166 --> 37:54.336
but, um, I gotta tell you,
the last few days,

37:54.403 --> 37:56.638
I've been feeling a bit...

37:56.706 --> 37:59.874
Like I did
thirteen years ago.

37:59.942 --> 38:03.111
I've been having
these weird deja-vu's.

38:03.178 --> 38:04.512
About what?

38:05.448 --> 38:08.849
Of why I fell for you
back then.

38:11.286 --> 38:13.854
But, you know,

38:13.921 --> 38:16.990
when I first showed up here
with Shane last year,

38:17.058 --> 38:19.426
you made it perfectly clear
that any relationship

38:19.494 --> 38:22.296
wasn't gonna happen
between us.

38:22.364 --> 38:23.496
Well, I... I don't...

38:23.564 --> 38:26.065
So Shane and I are
gonna leave tomorrow

38:26.133 --> 38:29.802
and he can visit you
anytime he wants,

38:29.870 --> 38:34.840
and you and I, well...
We'll be friends,

38:34.908 --> 38:37.310
just like Shane
wants us to be.

38:38.812 --> 38:39.844
<i>Okay?</i>

38:42.848 --> 38:43.882
Okay.

38:46.852 --> 38:47.786
Night!

38:47.853 --> 38:48.887
Good night.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.243
Oh my God, Peter.

39:52.047 --> 39:53.781
You said you wanted paper.

39:53.849 --> 39:55.115
What are these?

39:55.183 --> 39:57.552
Here. It's uh...

39:59.120 --> 40:01.054
It's something I saw
in Thailand once.

40:01.121 --> 40:03.156
People would make a wish

40:03.223 --> 40:04.691
and then light the lanterns,

40:04.759 --> 40:07.627
and then let the lanterns go
into the sky and then,

40:07.695 --> 40:11.865
well, you hope that your wishes
go up into the universe.

40:20.007 --> 40:21.274
Woo!

40:23.777 --> 40:24.810
Wanna take this one?

40:29.816 --> 40:31.384
Ready?

40:31.452 --> 40:32.384
Yeah.

40:35.154 --> 40:36.188
Ahhh!

40:38.057 --> 40:39.091
Whoa.

40:40.059 --> 40:41.460
Here's to our future.

40:48.933 --> 40:50.634
Oh wow.

40:52.871 --> 40:55.106
Happy anniversary.

40:55.173 --> 40:56.540
Happy anniversary.

41:53.794 --> 41:55.662
Yeah.

41:57.798 --> 42:00.467
So you turned down
Dark Horse, hey?

42:00.535 --> 42:01.968
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

42:03.271 --> 42:06.573
I was so nervous
for that audition.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.041
Well,
you didn't look it.

42:08.108 --> 42:09.141
- No?
- No.

42:09.209 --> 42:10.443
I felt it.

42:11.578 --> 42:13.079
I don't know,
I just...

42:13.146 --> 42:14.880
It's not for me.

42:14.948 --> 42:18.117
I, I don't belong
in that world.

42:19.752 --> 42:23.021
Does that mean that you
think you belong here?

42:25.090 --> 42:26.324
Maybe.

42:26.392 --> 42:28.293
Maybe? Yeah?

42:30.162 --> 42:31.463
I'm glad.

42:33.199 --> 42:36.701
Renard's offer made
me realize something.

42:37.669 --> 42:40.504
Even though Dark Horse
isn't the right path for me,

42:40.572 --> 42:42.406
there's so much more
out there.

42:42.474 --> 42:43.574
Hmm.

42:43.641 --> 42:44.708
You know,
we shouldn't be worried

42:44.775 --> 42:46.276
about you going off
to university.

42:47.512 --> 42:48.645
Okay, I shouldn't be
worried

42:48.713 --> 42:51.181
about you going off.

42:51.249 --> 42:52.516
I mean,
look at Grandpa.

42:52.584 --> 42:54.918
- Yeah.
- He's on his way to Paris.

42:54.986 --> 42:56.552
How exciting is that?

42:57.921 --> 42:59.255
We should just never
limit ourselves.

42:59.323 --> 43:03.426
You know, never tie
each other down - ever.

43:05.595 --> 43:07.763
Yeah... yeah,
totally.

43:12.401 --> 43:13.702
That fire's getting
low there,

43:13.770 --> 43:15.838
I should probably get
some more wood for it.
