Let me ask you something.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.992
Do you believe in angels?

00:36.036 --> 00:38.212
Because I do.
I've seen one.

00:38.255 --> 00:42.085
An angel named
Gabriella Carlita Espinosa.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.826
Oh, Gabriella,
if only you knew--

00:43.869 --> 00:45.480
- Hey, pal!
- Aah! Remy!

00:45.523 --> 00:48.048
Cricket, you've been staring
at Gabriella Espinosa

00:48.091 --> 00:50.050
like a cat watching
a laser pointer.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.964
Ever sincethe Valentine's dance,

00:52.008 --> 00:53.879
I haven't stoppedthinking about her.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.056
But because you danced
with her that night,

00:56.099 --> 01:00.060
I assumed you and her
were going out?

01:00.103 --> 01:02.497
What? No. Gabs and I
are just old friends.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.586
But, Cricket,
you can't just stare at her

01:04.629 --> 01:06.109
until she likes you.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.589
It's creepy.
Go talk to her.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.243
What? No, I can't.

01:09.286 --> 01:12.115
If I tell her I like her,
she might say that she hates me.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.378
Or even worse, she might tell me
that she likes me back.

how we'll do this.

things were.

but it was an honest life.

turning to mush.

Vasquez gave me.

and tell you exactlywhat
to say to Gabriella.

I can't do any worse.

to do as community director

Does my administration
sit idly by,

04:15.994 --> 04:19.563

I know the people deserve?

unless you got something good.

helping Cricket today.

mess out of everything.

Are you okay?
Can I help you in any way?

06:02.753 --> 06:04.102
Who, me?

06:04.146 --> 06:06.017
You may have noticed
some of the changes,

06:06.061 --> 06:09.717
nay, improvements
my administration has brought.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.719
Stray cats have been welcomed,

06:11.762 --> 06:14.112
for they too are members
of the community.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.376
Also, glitter has been added
to the drinking fountains,

06:16.419 --> 06:20.031
not because it was easy,
but because it was pretty.

06:20.075 --> 06:23.513
And all balls have been given
names and faces.

06:23.557 --> 06:27.299
I say, liberty and justice
for balls.

06:27.343 --> 06:30.477
- Whoo! You're weird as heck.
- Thank you.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.175
Vasquez, you couldn't have
called at a better time.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.413
- Are you busy?
- I'm just guarding

06:34.437 --> 06:35.960
your mother's luncheon.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.266
Cool, cool.
Second question:

06:37.309 --> 06:39.137
Do you know anything about love?

06:39.181 --> 06:41.444
Do I know anything about love?

06:41.488 --> 06:44.447
I know love can fill your heart,
but also leave it empty.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.928
Yes. I know love.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.669
Bingo bango.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.151
You kids are beingawful quiet.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.110
Talk. Engage.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.460
After all, this is the community center.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.027
Be communal.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.420
Okay.

07:00.463 --> 07:01.943
[gulps]

07:02.987 --> 07:04.598
Hey, uh, Gabriella,

07:04.641 --> 07:06.556
Big City sure is something, huh?

07:06.600 --> 07:10.299
It is... a big city.

07:10.342 --> 07:13.476
So, you like painting murals?

07:13.520 --> 07:14.956
No way. They're making medo this

07:14.999 --> 07:16.827
because last week, I got on the intercom

07:16.871 --> 07:17.935
and said the word "dookie."

07:17.959 --> 07:19.308
Whoa! That was you?

07:19.351 --> 07:20.788
I love your work.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.616
Man, they're really
getting strict here.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.811
Last month I got on the
intercomand said "trash butt,"

07:24.835 --> 07:26.794
and they only sent me home
with a letter.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.143
[laughs]Wait, what?

07:28.186 --> 07:29.971
Yeah. But before
giving it to my dad,

07:30.014 --> 07:32.582
I rewrote the letter to say
that they were thanking me

07:32.626 --> 07:34.018
for saying "trash butt."

07:34.062 --> 07:35.367
[giggles]Did it work?

07:35.411 --> 07:36.804
- No!
- Well, whatever.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.327
Trash butt's funny.

07:38.370 --> 07:41.286
I don't know.
I think dookie's classic.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.941
Well, I guess we shouldkeep painting.

07:43.985 --> 07:47.075
Uh, yeah. Hey, what do you say
we team up

07:47.118 --> 07:49.077
and do pranks this weekend?

07:49.120 --> 07:50.426
Oh, that'd be fun.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.790
But I'm leaving soonfor Montreal.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.124
Montreal? Oh, my gosh.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.735
Gabriella is moving?

07:54.778 --> 07:56.626
[Remy, over earpiece]
Cricket, I know I messed up,

07:56.650 --> 07:58.521
but this time
I've got something good.

07:58.565 --> 08:01.306
I hope it's good enough to
stopa girl from moving to Europe.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.178
Okay, Vasquez, let her rip.

08:03.221 --> 08:06.268
My nights are illuminated
by your kindness. The rain...

08:06.311 --> 08:08.096
My nights are illuminated
by your kindness.

08:08.139 --> 08:09.184
The rain...

08:09.227 --> 08:10.838
Hey, Gabriella?

08:10.881 --> 08:12.468
- What's up?
- Uh, my nights are illuminated

08:12.492 --> 08:14.276
by your kindness.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.800
The rain kept off my head
by your smile.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.585
Cricket, are youteasing me?

08:18.628 --> 08:22.023
Your smile, as radiant
as your purple blazer.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.938
Uh, your radiant purple blazer.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.809
Hey, buddy...

08:25.853 --> 08:29.421
[Vasquez] I would stand against
the winds of nature itself.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.555
With tender glances,
douse me, hedonist goddess.

08:32.599 --> 08:33.904
Why don't we just paint?

08:33.948 --> 08:35.471
Uh...

08:35.515 --> 08:37.081
Douse me, hedonist goddess.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.040
- Just paint.
- Douse me, hedon--

08:39.083 --> 08:40.824
- Paint.
- Douse me head in paint!

08:40.868 --> 08:42.870
Douse me head in paint!

08:42.913 --> 08:45.307
[grunts]

08:45.350 --> 08:47.004
Sorry, dude, I'd love to figure out

08:47.048 --> 08:48.571
what's going on here,

08:48.615 --> 08:50.573
but I've got to catch my bus
for Montreal.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.922
Bye.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.620
Aah!

08:53.663 --> 08:55.622
I'm sorry, buddy. I messed up.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.537
Well, she's moving
to Montreal anyways,

08:57.580 --> 08:59.539
so this plan was doomed
from the start.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.844
Whoa!

09:00.888 --> 09:02.672
That girl likes you.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.935
What makes you say that?

09:04.979 --> 09:08.025
I'm good at reading
social situations!

09:08.069 --> 09:09.113
[panting]

09:09.157 --> 09:10.985
Oh, my gosh.
Gabriella likes me?

09:11.028 --> 09:12.464
I got to find out for sure.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.641
Come on, Remy,
we've got a bus to catch.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.730
Ah. Good kids.

09:16.773 --> 09:19.123
Terrible painters, though.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.995
[Cricket]Gabriella wait!

09:21.038 --> 09:22.779
Wait!

09:22.823 --> 09:24.128
[panting]

09:24.172 --> 09:25.565
- She's gone.
- Don't worry.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.741
I already called inthe cavalry.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.656
Excuse me, Master Cricket,

09:29.699 --> 09:31.701
but perhaps I may be
of assistance.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.311
[grunts and yells]

09:35.096 --> 09:36.663
Thanks for helping me today,
Remy.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.621
What? But I didn't know
what I was doing.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.927
- [both scream]
- That's okay.

09:39.970 --> 09:43.670
What matters is that you gave mea push!

09:43.713 --> 09:45.976
Vasquez, that's the bus.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.935
[grunts and exclaims]

09:47.978 --> 09:49.284
For love.

09:49.327 --> 09:50.633
Ah!

09:50.677 --> 09:51.982
Hey.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.332
[laughs]
Uh, hey, Cricket.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.725
What are you doing here?

09:55.769 --> 09:57.074
Gabriella, I...

09:57.118 --> 09:58.119
I like you.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.990
And I just wanted to know...

10:00.034 --> 10:01.949
do you like me too?

10:01.992 --> 10:04.952
Yeah. Do you wantto go out?

10:04.995 --> 10:08.738
Oh, does that mean we have to,
like, hold hands all the time?

10:08.782 --> 10:11.785
- What? No.
- Do we gotta exchange
gifts and flowers?

10:11.828 --> 10:13.482
Ew. No.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.702
Do we got to smooch?

10:15.745 --> 10:18.792
No, weirdo. It just means we
getto tell people we're going out.

10:18.835 --> 10:21.751
Oh, okay.
Well, then, yeah, I'm in.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.884
Well, this is my stop.

10:23.927 --> 10:27.322
Wait, I thought you were
moving to Montreal.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.541
No, I'm just going there
for vacation.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.195
I kept trying to tell you,

10:31.239 --> 10:33.502
but you were too busy talking
to Remy on that earpiece.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.286
See you when I'm back.

10:35.330 --> 10:38.246
Yeah. See you
when you're back.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.030
Hey, Cricket. How'd it go?

10:40.074 --> 10:41.553
Well, let's just say

10:41.597 --> 10:45.688
that Cricket Green'sgot a girlfriend!

10:45.732 --> 10:46.907
Well, the mural was a bust,

10:46.950 --> 10:49.170
but at least things here
are under control?

10:49.213 --> 10:51.694
- [cats meowing]
- [kids chattering]

10:53.609 --> 10:55.045
[whimpering]

10:55.089 --> 10:56.612
Welcome back, ma'am.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.918
I'd say with all these reforms,

10:57.961 --> 11:00.094
I have successfully
secured my legacy.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.617
Well, goodbye.
