WEBVTT

00:07.572 --> 00:09.357
Aah! Aah!

01:43.190 --> 01:45.235
I am centered.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.585
I am at peace.

01:47.585 --> 01:52.155
I create my own path,
and I walk in it fearlessly.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.288
<i>Hunting has a way
of changing a person.</i>

01:54.288 --> 01:57.421
<i>After a while,
right, wrong, good, evil,</i>

01:57.421 --> 01:59.336
<i>they all start to look
the same.</i>

01:59.336 --> 02:00.903
<i>And then it makes you start
to wonder,</i>

02:00.903 --> 02:04.341
<i>"Who's really the monster
here--them or me?"</i>

02:04.341 --> 02:06.343
I am centered.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.174
I am at peace.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.310
I am deeply annoyed.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.528
I only need the van
for an hour, okay?

02:17.528 --> 02:19.182
Just to check the woods
behind the quarry

02:19.182 --> 02:20.531
just to see if there's any sign
of Rockin' Roxy

02:20.531 --> 02:21.663
or the Akrida.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.317
Hard no, <i>amigo.</i>

02:23.317 --> 02:25.188
And not just because you
already searched those woods

02:25.188 --> 02:27.190
but because you almost cracked
my front axle in the process.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.452
- Oh, yeah--
- And you do not want

02:28.452 --> 02:30.324
to see my face
if that actually happens.

02:30.324 --> 02:33.457
Kind of looks like that.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.198
Could the two of you
please keep it down?

02:35.198 --> 02:36.721
I am trying to meditate.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.375
Well, that all depends
on Jonathan

02:38.375 --> 02:39.985
and whether he's willing
to let go of his obsession

02:39.985 --> 02:41.378
with searching the quarry.

02:41.378 --> 02:43.467
I-I am not obsessed.
I'm thorough.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.208
Okay, what if we missed
something?

02:45.208 --> 02:46.992
We didn't miss anything.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.646
My guy down at city hall
should be getting back to me

02:48.646 --> 02:50.735
any moment now
with new land acquisitions

02:50.735 --> 02:52.476
made this month, all right?

02:52.476 --> 02:54.304
The radio tower has to be
on one of those properties.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.915
So mellow out, <i>amor.</i>

02:56.915 --> 02:58.700
"Mellow out"?

02:58.700 --> 03:00.919
Carlos, the fate of the world
is literally at stake.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.356
We know.

03:02.356 --> 03:05.010
And we all want
the same thing, John.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.926
Perhaps you'd like to join me.
Finding your center might help.

03:07.926 --> 03:11.234
Yeah, or come with me
to a session of Dr. Z's.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.627
He's really been helping me.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.371
Is everything okay in here?

03:17.371 --> 03:18.676
Everything's fine.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.243
No, it's not.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.375
Yeah.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.421
Is that my robe?

03:26.293 --> 03:28.382
I like to think of it
as our robe.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.432
Hello?

03:48.010 --> 03:50.882
- Your dad has a Batphone?
- Hunter line only.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.406
Hello?

03:54.016 --> 03:55.974
Who's Tracy Gellar?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.977
Tracy and my mom used to hunt
together back in the day.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.283
I've known her my entire life.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.416
She's practically an aunt
to me.

04:02.416 --> 04:05.636
- Gellar. Is she the one who--
- Retired? Yeah.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.595
So you can imagine
how surprised she was

04:07.595 --> 04:09.988
when she woke up this morning
to find Darla,

04:09.988 --> 04:11.294
one of her old
hunting partners,

04:11.294 --> 04:12.991
mutilated in her barn.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.776
I take it
from all the silver weapons

04:14.776 --> 04:17.909
and lore books we packed,
you're thinking it's werewolf?

04:17.909 --> 04:20.085
Tracy found
Darla's hunting journal.

04:20.085 --> 04:23.001
Last entry indicated
that she was tracking one.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.787
Tracy wants us to track down
this werewolf and kill it.

04:25.787 --> 04:28.311
I'm sorry, can we just
back it up a little bit

04:28.311 --> 04:29.791
to the part where you said
that s-she retired,

04:29.791 --> 04:32.010
as in she actually
got out of hunting?

04:33.882 --> 04:35.840
Yeah.
About ten years ago.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.016
Well, you kind of buried
the lede there, Campbell.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.323
I thought getting out of
hunting was next to impossible.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.978
I mean, what was that whole
thing that you said about the--

04:42.978 --> 04:44.414
"The only thing worse
than how it starts

04:44.414 --> 04:45.981
for hunters
is how it ends"?

04:45.981 --> 04:48.026
Okay, so I embellished
for dramatic effect.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.115
Are we really gonna act
surprised by that now?

04:50.115 --> 04:53.945
It's rare,
but Tracy did it somehow.

04:53.945 --> 04:56.513
The truth is,
hearing about her starting over

04:56.513 --> 04:58.341
and creating this amazing life

04:58.341 --> 05:02.519
made me realize
maybe I could do it too.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.148
Wow.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.976
It's beautiful.

05:24.976 --> 05:28.371
You can grow
so much weed out here.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.373
- Dude.
- Well, I'm sorry.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.897
I'm just trying to say
this place has charm.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.557
- Cricket.
- Cricket?

05:40.557 --> 05:42.907
- What a sweet pet name.
- Don't.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.648
Hey, Aunt Tracy.

05:44.648 --> 05:47.390
I was expecting your old man.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.871
Last I heard,
you were gettin' out.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.394
Yeah.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.440
So where is he?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.093
That's a long story.

05:55.093 --> 05:58.923
But, um, we're all really sorry
about Darla.

05:58.923 --> 06:01.665
Me too.
She was one of the good ones.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.711
But that's the life
of the hunter, right?

06:03.711 --> 06:05.887
Kill or be killed.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.584
So who do we have here?

06:07.584 --> 06:11.022
Tracy, this is John,
Carlos, and Lata.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.676
Nice to meet y'all.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.765
Thanks for coming out
on such short notice.

06:14.765 --> 06:17.420
Course.
So Darla, is she--

06:17.420 --> 06:19.770
She's still in the barn.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.731
It's been a while since I've
been around a scene like that.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.428
Can't say I missed it.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.434
I have some arrangements
to finish up.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.624
- So what do you think?
- These claw marks

06:47.624 --> 06:49.713
are consistent
with a werewolf attack.

06:49.713 --> 06:52.586
I'll need to take measurements
to make sure.

06:52.586 --> 06:55.545
Okay. Well, we'll see
what else we can find.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.729
Tracy seemed
pretty shaken up.

07:05.729 --> 07:08.471
Yeah.
Well, can you blame her?

07:08.471 --> 07:10.081
I mean, she thought
all of this was in the past,

07:10.081 --> 07:12.954
and now it's splattered
over her walls.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.738
I can't wait for the day

07:14.738 --> 07:16.871
when the sight of a dead body
shakes me up like that.

07:19.526 --> 07:20.831
Where's Carlos?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.833
Right here.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.748
I found a needle
in a haystack up there.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.663
Is that a claw?

07:26.663 --> 07:28.186
Found it lodged
in the ceiling of the barn.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.579
I don't know many werewolves
that make it a habit

07:29.579 --> 07:31.799
of perching in the rafters.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.627
That's because
I actually don't think

07:33.627 --> 07:35.629
we're dealing with a werewolf.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.848
The curvature of this claw
is all wrong.

07:37.848 --> 07:41.983
Okay,
so what did attack Darla?

07:41.983 --> 07:43.724
Sorry to interrupt.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.117
Everything's ready.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.081
What's ready?

07:54.909 --> 07:56.650
A hunter's funeral.

08:04.527 --> 08:10.881

09:55.682 --> 09:58.641
Here you go.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.644
Back in the day, a cold drink
helped keep me focused.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.821
- Thanks, Tracy.
- Thank you, Cricket.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.781
You kids need anything else,
let me know.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.261
Actually, could I look
at your lore books?

10:10.261 --> 10:11.741
Someone took out

10:11.741 --> 10:13.656
my "Wilmont's Guide
to Monster Anatomy"

10:13.656 --> 10:15.919
to make room
for their machetes.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.791
I still stand
by that decision.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.924
Sorry, sweetie, I tossed out
all that stuff years ago.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.187
Unless you think
my Encyclopedia Britannica

10:23.187 --> 10:25.146
or pile of Harlequin romances

10:25.146 --> 10:27.278
holds the key to unlocking
your mystery.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.193
Unfortunately, no.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.021
I wouldn't mind taking
a gander at those Harlequins.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.849
This one's not shy.

10:32.849 --> 10:36.070
They're in the study, sweetie.
Knock yourself out.

10:38.725 --> 10:39.987
I can't find a description

10:39.987 --> 10:41.684
of this claw anywhere.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.991
What if that's because
it's not here?

10:43.991 --> 10:45.862
Okay, hear me out. Listen.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.038
What if this is another one
of those unicorn-like monsters

10:48.038 --> 10:49.692
that the Akrida baited
to Lawrence?

10:49.692 --> 10:51.694
Look, Tracy's farm
isn't that far, okay?

10:51.694 --> 10:53.740
What if one of the monsters

10:53.740 --> 10:55.698
strayed off the path
and killed Darla?

10:55.698 --> 10:57.700
We have been looking
for the radio tower

10:57.700 --> 10:59.484
to find the Akrida, right?

10:59.484 --> 11:02.879
What if there was a way
to bring the Akrida to us?

11:02.879 --> 11:04.228
Look, we capture this thing,

11:04.228 --> 11:06.491
we can use its essence
to lure in the Akrida.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.232
Maybe.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.843
But we still don't have a way
to take the Akrida out

11:09.843 --> 11:12.367
even if we do find them.
- She's right.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.848
The Men of Letters' box
is the only way to harm them.

11:14.848 --> 11:15.892
And despite
all of our research,

11:15.892 --> 11:17.241
it still doesn't work.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.721
Okay, well, look,
there's got to be

11:18.721 --> 11:19.983
some other way
to ID this thing.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.506
I actually might know
someone nearby

11:21.506 --> 11:22.986
who can help.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.858
He specializes
in monster identification.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.816
Great. I'll drive.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.513
Does this little friend
of yours live near a bar?

11:28.513 --> 11:29.863
All this clean living

11:29.863 --> 11:32.779
is starting
to make me feel dirty.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.389
Hmm.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.788
Is it the funeral?

11:41.788 --> 11:43.224
It hit kind of close to home
for me too.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.313
It's not just the funeral.

11:47.968 --> 11:51.449
Do you think I am a liability

11:51.449 --> 11:53.234
as a hunter?

11:53.234 --> 11:54.801
What are you talking about?

11:54.801 --> 11:56.454
I know I'm good
at the science stuff,

11:56.454 --> 12:00.502
the lore stuff,
but it's not what you guys do.

12:01.808 --> 12:05.899
- You mean the fighting part?
- I mean the hunting part.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.466
It's right there in the title.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.947
Being a pacifist and a hunter,

12:10.947 --> 12:14.429
it's like I'm torn
between two different worlds.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.213
And seeing Darla
on the pyre back there

12:16.213 --> 12:20.087
reminded me of what happens
when you can't punch back.

12:34.014 --> 12:37.191
- Seriously?
- Just trust me.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.894
Okay, I thought you said
we were looking

12:44.894 --> 12:48.985
for a monster expert,
not Norman Bates.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.944
This is just
the front-facing part.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.815
He actually took over
the whole operation

12:52.815 --> 12:54.251
from his father.
- Yeah, no, sure.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.166
I-I get that,
but what kind of weirdo

12:56.166 --> 12:58.821
likes to stuff dead things?
- Latika?

12:58.821 --> 13:03.957
Hey.
So good to see you again.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.828
How's that, uh--

13:05.828 --> 13:07.003
how's that 20 blade
working out for you?

13:07.003 --> 13:08.918
Uh, you were right--
so much better

13:08.918 --> 13:10.528
for cutting
through thick tissue.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.621
Anton,
this is my friend Carlos.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.841
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure's all mine.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.888
I loved "Psycho."

13:24.325 --> 13:26.109
Interesting.
I'm--I'm more

13:26.109 --> 13:29.852
of a "Rear Window"
kind of guy myself, so...

13:29.852 --> 13:31.549
So what brings you two
in today?

13:31.549 --> 13:34.204
We were hoping
you could help us identify

13:34.204 --> 13:36.163
what type of monster
this came from.

13:36.163 --> 13:39.557
Ah, monster mystery--
my favorite.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.998
So you said
it's a long story.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.914
We got nothing but time
right now, so dish.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.567
Where's your pops?

13:49.567 --> 13:51.221
We had one
of our ongoing disagreements

13:51.221 --> 13:52.570
about me leaving hunting.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.877
And then the next day,
he took off

13:54.877 --> 13:57.575
to track down these monsters
called the Akrida.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.186
I haven't seen him since.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.014
What about your mom?

14:01.014 --> 14:03.233
Uh, Minnesota, last I heard.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.496
But she's not exactly
in the picture either.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.977
They separated again?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.240
Oh, yeah,
when you were little.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.069
Remember that time you came
to stay with me in Kalamazoo?

14:13.069 --> 14:14.679
They were on a break.

14:14.679 --> 14:17.073
Your daddy went off
to make things right.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.075
Parents are idiots.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.903
They'll work it out eventually.

14:20.903 --> 14:24.211
In the meantime, if they're off
saving the world,

14:24.211 --> 14:27.040
what are you still
doing here hunting?

14:27.040 --> 14:29.042
Once I find Dad
and track down these Akrida,

14:29.042 --> 14:30.260
then I'm out.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.609
You sure that's not
the only reason

14:31.609 --> 14:33.089
you're sticking around?

14:37.964 --> 14:39.922
Pretty sure...

14:39.922 --> 14:41.706
yeah.

14:41.706 --> 14:44.622
Samuel's been fending for
himself for quite a while now.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.450
And there is always
gonna be some monster

14:46.450 --> 14:48.452
needs taking down.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.325
You need to start looking out
for number one.

14:52.674 --> 14:55.024
What do you want to do,
anyway, when you get out?

14:56.243 --> 14:58.201
Um...

14:58.201 --> 15:00.943
finish school,
college, maybe.

15:03.337 --> 15:05.643
Did you have any regrets
about it--

15:05.643 --> 15:06.993
leaving?

15:09.343 --> 15:11.475
In the ten years since...

15:11.475 --> 15:13.086
I've read hundreds of books,

15:13.086 --> 15:15.436
stepped foot
on almost every continent.

15:15.436 --> 15:19.396
I went to college,
cultivated the land...

15:19.396 --> 15:21.050
broke nearly a dozen hearts.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.486
Okay.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.097
Made a prizewinning
lemon meringue.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.316
Mm-hmm.

15:26.316 --> 15:30.059
My only regret is
that I didn't get out sooner.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.997
So, Carlos,
how do you know Lata?

15:59.349 --> 16:01.525
Your friend's
the silent type, I see.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.484
Actually, no.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.356
What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

16:06.356 --> 16:09.577
Then speak.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.015
- Excuse me.
- I-I--oh, sorry.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.149
Um, I...

16:16.149 --> 16:18.020
I, um--
- You...

16:18.020 --> 16:21.023
- Me, I just--
- I think I found it.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.416
- Oh, thank God.
- Thank God.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.723
See?

16:25.723 --> 16:27.812
I knew the burn pattern
on the claw looked familiar.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.728
This is your mystery monster.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.165
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

16:32.165 --> 16:34.384
Thanks, Lata.

16:34.384 --> 16:38.040
So the monster that killed
Darla is a soucouyant.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.825
It's a rare vampire witch
from the Caribbean.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.219
No, that's...

16:43.219 --> 16:46.179
that's impossible.
- Actually, it's not.

16:46.179 --> 16:48.224
You see, these--
these unicorn-type monsters,

16:48.224 --> 16:50.052
they're being lured to Lawrence
by the Akr--

16:50.052 --> 16:52.098
No, you don't understand.
I've hunted soucouyant before.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.535
- You have? When?
- My last hunt.

16:54.535 --> 16:58.713
Me and the team--
Darla, Rob, and Mac--

16:58.713 --> 17:00.410
were in Barbados.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.064
A small town
was being terrorized

17:02.064 --> 17:03.370
by a band of soucouyant.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.111
First night,
we killed three of the four,

17:05.111 --> 17:07.417
but the last one
put up a fight.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.767
But it got away.
Holed up in its cave.

17:09.767 --> 17:13.075
Mac got impatient,
went in after it.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.600
But then there was a cave-in.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.081
Mac and the soucouyant
were both killed.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.517
At least,
that's what I thought.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.432
So you really think
this is the same monster

17:22.432 --> 17:25.783
and it came all this way
for what, revenge?

17:25.783 --> 17:29.135
Darla's already dead,
and who knows about Rob?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.354
Did Lata say whether or not
sigils and hex bags

17:31.354 --> 17:33.095
work against these things?

17:33.095 --> 17:34.662
No.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.426
- John, wait!
- Go. I'm okay.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.346
John, stop!

18:28.803 --> 18:30.674
- Ow.
- Sorry.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.937
I was thinking about Anton.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.157
Yeah, well, maybe
he should sew me up, then.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.680
Thank you
for bringing me here.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.813
I put you in danger, and--

18:38.813 --> 18:40.858
No, it's not your fault.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.643
Besides, some of us
don't need any help

18:42.643 --> 18:44.166
putting ourselves in danger.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.950
Look, I still
don't understand.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.692
I mean, how did the soucouyant
get out of the cave?

18:48.692 --> 18:50.607
I may have a theory.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.305
Mac didn't get
a hunter's funeral

18:52.305 --> 18:53.871
because of the cave-in.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.656
And that never sat right
with Rob.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.311
He called me about a month ago.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.226
The ten-year anniversary
of Mac's death was coming up,

19:00.226 --> 19:01.792
and he wanted to go back

19:01.792 --> 19:04.360
and finally put Mac to rest
the right way.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.449
So when he went into the cave
to collect Mac's remains,

19:06.449 --> 19:08.669
the soucouyant was still alive
after all these years?

19:08.669 --> 19:10.366
I guess so.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.194
Darla never heard back
from Rob,

19:12.194 --> 19:15.197
so she probably figured
he got killed.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.460
And when the soucouyant
went after her,

19:17.460 --> 19:20.681
she came to the farm
to try and warn me.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.465
I'm sorry I didn't tell y'all
this sooner,

19:22.465 --> 19:25.251
but in a million years, I never
thought it all connected.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.557
You said you killed three of
these things in the past, yeah?

19:27.557 --> 19:29.211
What's the secret?
- Beheading.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.908
Or a stake in the heart
will do it.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.694
Well,
since Tracy's here safe,

19:33.694 --> 19:35.913
I say we load up
as many weapons as we can,

19:35.913 --> 19:38.002
we go back to the farm,
and we take this thing out

19:38.002 --> 19:39.395
before it can hurt anyone else.

19:39.395 --> 19:40.875
Whoa.
Pump the brakes, soldier boy.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.398
I want to play this safe.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.748
This thing already killed
two veteran hunters

19:44.748 --> 19:46.359
and nearly killed you too.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.535
Taking off its arm
didn't even make it flinch,

19:48.535 --> 19:50.406
and there was no blood
left behind,

19:50.406 --> 19:52.365
so Lata thinks something else
is going on with this thing,

19:52.365 --> 19:54.367
which is why she invited Anton
to take a look at it.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.717
He's here?

19:56.717 --> 19:58.936
Oh, my--I need to change
this--this shirt,

19:58.936 --> 20:00.242
these pants, this everything.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.939
Oh, my God.
- Where are you going?

20:01.939 --> 20:03.550
I'm gonna keep
my shoulder loose.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.726
Call me back when it's safe.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.249
Why can't I say anything
when I'm around him?

20:07.249 --> 20:08.772
I-I-I flirt with everyone.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.426
I-I literally do flirt
with everyone.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.254
I don't know why I can't--
- Hey.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.951
What is going on with him?

20:20.262 --> 20:22.264
Its epidermis
is badly burned,

20:22.264 --> 20:24.310
but the fact
that any skin remains at all

20:24.310 --> 20:26.921
is absolutely fascinating.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.270
It must secrete some sort

20:28.270 --> 20:30.968
of self-generating
heat retardant.

20:30.968 --> 20:34.233
Shall we crack her open,
give that 20 blade a spin?

20:35.451 --> 20:37.497
Your--your friend Carlos
isn't interested in joining us?

20:38.846 --> 20:42.328
Frankly speaking,
he's a bit scared

20:42.328 --> 20:44.460
to be anywhere near here
right now.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.809
Ah.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.289
He's squeamish.

20:47.289 --> 20:50.423
And a monster hunter--
fascinating.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.860
It must be hard for him.
- Mm-hmm.

20:56.037 --> 20:58.344
Hmm. Rigor mortis?

20:58.344 --> 21:00.650
I've never seen rigor mortis
set in so quickly.

21:00.650 --> 21:04.437
Um, let's try the bone saw.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.460
Is that what I think it is?

21:39.863 --> 21:42.823
Hey. Can we talk?

21:42.823 --> 21:45.434
So you can lecture me
about putting myself in danger?

21:45.434 --> 21:47.480
I'm good. Thanks.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.873
You've been off
for the past couple of weeks.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.658
I should have noticed before.

21:51.658 --> 21:54.878
I'm not the only one
who is worried about you, John.

21:54.878 --> 21:57.751
Everyone is, especially Carlos.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.147
He told me what happened...

22:03.147 --> 22:04.758
what you did to Mars Neto.

22:07.456 --> 22:08.892
I did what I had to do.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.851
And I would--I'd do it again.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.374
John.

22:12.374 --> 22:15.899
We've been hunting nonstop
since New Orleans.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.727
Maybe you need a break.

22:17.727 --> 22:20.643
- You gonna bench me, Coach?
- No, John.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.036
Because this isn't
the big game.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.385
It's life or death.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.387
You think
I don't know that?

22:25.387 --> 22:27.868
I don't know what you think.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.870
So just talk to me, please.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.872
I let you walk around
inside my head,

22:31.872 --> 22:33.526
see everything.

22:33.526 --> 22:36.093
Now I need you to let me
into yours just a little bit

22:36.093 --> 22:38.400
so I can help.
- Okay, you want to help?

22:38.400 --> 22:41.011
Want in my head? Fine.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.536
This morning,
we cremated a woman

22:43.536 --> 22:45.538
who used to be a hunter
just like you.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.409
I mean, don't you get it, Mary?

22:47.409 --> 22:49.411
Every moment that you're
out there hunting a monster

22:49.411 --> 22:51.413
is another moment
that you could die.

22:51.413 --> 22:54.416
And I will not be the person
to wrap you in a white cloth,

22:54.416 --> 22:55.939
put a knife in your hand,

22:55.939 --> 22:57.201
and send you to the afterlife
in a blaze of glory.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.595
So yes...

22:59.595 --> 23:01.423
if getting you
out of hunting alive

23:01.423 --> 23:03.469
means pushing myself,

23:03.469 --> 23:05.949
that's exactly what I'll do.

23:05.949 --> 23:08.125
So you're doing
all of this for me?

23:08.125 --> 23:09.736
That's the only reason?

23:09.736 --> 23:11.433
Well, there is the whole
"saving the world" part.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.130
That's not what I meant.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.611
Your mom told me
about you and danger

23:15.611 --> 23:17.091
and how you've run towards it

23:17.091 --> 23:18.745
every single time
since you were a kid.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.964
I don't need you
or my mom psychoanalyzing me.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.444
And I don't need you
using me as an excuse

23:22.444 --> 23:24.794
to avoid your issues.

23:27.493 --> 23:30.496
Uh, sorry to interrupt,

23:30.496 --> 23:32.498
but there's something
the two of you need to see.

23:34.935 --> 23:38.591
I'll be done in a minute.
I just need to cool down.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.166
You and your new friend

23:49.166 --> 23:50.777
really went to town
on that thing.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.822
Did Anton
say anything about me?

23:52.822 --> 23:53.997
I mean, did you tell him
I was--

23:53.997 --> 23:56.783
Losi, take a breath.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.480
What do you have for us, Lata?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.526
The reason
the soucouyant didn't die

24:00.526 --> 24:04.007
when you sliced off its arm
is because it's already dead.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.531
How is that possible?

24:05.531 --> 24:07.489
Let me guess:
zombie soucouyant?

24:07.489 --> 24:10.187
Not a zombie but a ghost--

24:10.187 --> 24:12.973
a vengeful spirit, most likely.

24:12.973 --> 24:15.628
The substance here
is ectoplasm.

24:15.628 --> 24:19.022
Okay, so a vengeful spirit
possessed the soucouyant

24:19.022 --> 24:22.112
and went after Tracy
and her hunting crew.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.679
Why?

24:23.679 --> 24:26.508
That, I'm afraid,
I can't tell you.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.079
What is it?

24:33.907 --> 24:35.256
What haven't you told us?

24:38.041 --> 24:41.523
The cave-in that killed Mac...

24:41.523 --> 24:43.177
it wasn't an accident.

24:45.005 --> 24:47.224
Me and the rest of the team...

24:51.185 --> 24:53.187
We killed him.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.718
- You lied to us.
- No.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.241
Everything I told you was true.

25:04.241 --> 25:07.070
I just didn't...
tell you everything.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.332
Looks like we've been hunting

25:08.332 --> 25:09.856
the wrong monster
this whole time.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.684
Darla and me were like
the Lennon and McCartney

25:11.684 --> 25:12.989
of the group, you know?

25:12.989 --> 25:15.035
We brought everybody else in.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.906
We knew Mac was a dark soul
from the get-go,

25:16.906 --> 25:18.560
but he was a damn good hunter.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.084
He'd had a rough childhood...

25:21.084 --> 25:23.565
abused by his dad,
bullied by the other kids,

25:23.565 --> 25:25.698
and he thought
if he became a hunter

25:25.698 --> 25:27.743
and killed real monsters,
that would help with the pain

25:27.743 --> 25:29.702
that the other kind
had caused him.

25:29.702 --> 25:33.270
But when that didn't work,
he turned to dark magic.

25:33.270 --> 25:36.273
He thought a little taste
of power might be the fix.

25:36.273 --> 25:38.580
Course,
that didn't pan out either.

25:38.580 --> 25:42.628
But he did become more violent,
more aggressive,

25:42.628 --> 25:45.282
and an even more
effective hunter.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.937
So you had a friend stuck
in a cycle of violence,

25:47.937 --> 25:49.722
and instead of helping him,

25:49.722 --> 25:52.594
you--you wielded him
like some kind of weapon?

25:52.594 --> 25:54.857
No, honey,
we tried to help him.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.859
We really did, but Mac,
he just--

25:56.859 --> 25:59.122
he--he wouldn't listen.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.298
Things came to a head
with those soucouyant--

26:01.298 --> 26:02.909
hardest hunt we ever had.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.301
- What happened?
- All that black magic

26:04.301 --> 26:07.304
just caught up with him.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.872
Mac snapped.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.744
He started acting paranoid,

26:11.744 --> 26:13.397
saying the rest of the team
was out to get him.

26:13.397 --> 26:14.921
He even attacked Darla.

26:14.921 --> 26:17.227
At that point,
we knew he was too far gone,

26:17.227 --> 26:19.621
and we were afraid
of what he was gonna do next.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.406
So you decided the best
solution was to kill him.

26:22.406 --> 26:23.799
Think what you want,

26:23.799 --> 26:25.801
but you didn't see
the look in his eye.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.629
He was stronger
and more powerful

26:27.629 --> 26:28.978
than all of us combined.

26:28.978 --> 26:31.067
And on top of that,
he knew all our tricks.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.895
It was clear as day.

26:32.895 --> 26:35.115
If he turned on us,

26:35.115 --> 26:37.683
we didn't stand a chance.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.641
So we waited
for the right time.

26:39.641 --> 26:42.122
And when Mac went into the cave
after the last soucouyant...

26:44.211 --> 26:45.691
We set off some C-4.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.000
And buried them alive.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.916
I wish there'd been
another way, but...

26:53.916 --> 26:56.310
we didn't have a choice.

26:56.310 --> 26:59.008
Violence is always a choice.

26:59.008 --> 27:02.142
So you leaving hunting...

27:02.142 --> 27:04.013
I knew I couldn't hunt
after that.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.015
I was done.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.974
So you started a farm
and just played make-believe,

27:07.974 --> 27:09.366
like none of this
ever happened?

27:09.366 --> 27:10.759
Cricket--

27:10.759 --> 27:11.934
Stop with the stupid name, okay?

27:11.934 --> 27:13.675
There's not a night goes by

27:13.675 --> 27:16.025
I'm not haunted by what I did.

27:16.025 --> 27:18.462
Now my past
has come back to get me.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.247
I'm sorry.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.380
Wait.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.947
I know, John and Mac,
it's a little

27:24.947 --> 27:27.036
too Ghost of Christmas Future
for me too.

27:27.036 --> 27:29.212
No, John said
he'd only be a minute.

27:29.212 --> 27:30.866
So where is he?

28:26.792 --> 28:28.750
Thanks
for seeing this through.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.273
I'm not out here for you.

28:38.325 --> 28:39.979
The barn.
There he is!

28:43.939 --> 28:45.462
John?

28:46.986 --> 28:48.552
Are you--

28:53.775 --> 28:57.039
John?
- I'm sorry.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.738
Tall, dark, and angry can't
come to the phone right now.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.137
Mac.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.965
Hi, Trace.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.140
You got old.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.968
Carlos, get her
out of here right now.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.100
I wouldn't.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.020
Carlos!

29:23.936 --> 29:25.981
Don't. For John.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.462
John...

29:28.462 --> 29:30.116
I know you're in there.

29:30.116 --> 29:33.815
And I know you can hear me.
You have to fight, okay?

29:33.815 --> 29:35.164
Don't let Mac--

29:35.164 --> 29:36.470
I hate to break it
to you, sweetheart,

29:36.470 --> 29:38.254
but old Johnny boy,

29:38.254 --> 29:40.517
well, he's along for the ride.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.302
See, that's why I chose
to possess him.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.870
Well, that, and I wanted
two hands to kill Trace.

29:47.307 --> 29:48.917
All right.

29:57.534 --> 29:59.449
Oh, don't worry.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.147
No, you see,

30:01.147 --> 30:03.845
I won't be a coward
like you were.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.154
Unlike some people I know,

30:08.154 --> 30:10.634
I have the decency
to look a friend in the face

30:10.634 --> 30:12.854
before I take
their last breath.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.211
Aah!

30:36.704 --> 30:38.662
This is between her and me.

30:38.662 --> 30:41.187
You have to go
through me first.

30:41.187 --> 30:42.884
Have it your way.

31:01.076 --> 31:02.469
You can't hurt me.

31:05.472 --> 31:08.605
All I've ever known
are clenched fists.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.651
Learned that from my old man.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.961
There's nothing
that you can do to me...

31:18.006 --> 31:20.182
That I haven't
already survived.

31:23.229 --> 31:26.188
Tracy, please, don't.

31:26.188 --> 31:28.234
I don't have a choice.

31:28.234 --> 31:29.322
Do it.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.935
Yes, you do.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.633
- Lata, what are you doing?
- Lata, get back.

31:36.633 --> 31:39.419
More violence
isn't the answer,

31:39.419 --> 31:42.422
not when you've spent
a lifetime with it,

31:42.422 --> 31:45.947
when it's touched
everything you've ever had.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.950
Your father wasn't the only one
with clenched fists, Mac.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.953
- You think you know me?
- No, but I know myself.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.650
When I was 13,
my country was attacked,

31:53.650 --> 31:54.956
and my father went to war.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.653
When he returned,
he was different.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.438
He was angry all the time.

31:58.438 --> 31:59.961
He had these violent outbursts.

31:59.961 --> 32:02.137
It was like
the war infected him.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.660
I tried to make myself smaller

32:03.660 --> 32:06.228
so the violence
wouldn't find me, but it did.

32:06.228 --> 32:10.319
For the longest time,
it made me feel powerless,

32:10.319 --> 32:13.757
until one day,
it made me feel angry.

32:13.757 --> 32:17.065
And that anger
kept growing inside of me,

32:17.065 --> 32:19.676
just like it did for my father.

32:22.592 --> 32:26.074
And I acted
on that anger for years

32:26.074 --> 32:27.684
until I hurt someone,

32:27.684 --> 32:30.426
and that's when I knew
I had to make the change.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.776
You can keep hurting
those that have wronged you,

32:32.776 --> 32:35.344
keep living in that anger
and violence,

32:35.344 --> 32:38.304
but it won't bring you peace.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.263
Peace has to be chosen.

32:41.263 --> 32:44.266
It's what I chose.

32:44.266 --> 32:47.313
I chose my team.

32:47.313 --> 32:50.011
But when I needed them,

32:50.011 --> 32:54.015
they turned their backs on me
because it was easier.

32:59.716 --> 33:02.110
Why did you give up on me?

33:02.110 --> 33:05.505
I didn't know
how to help you.

33:05.505 --> 33:08.377
I was scared.
- I was scared too.

33:08.377 --> 33:11.728
I needed my family by my side.

33:11.728 --> 33:15.819
I know it's about ten years
too late...

33:15.819 --> 33:18.300
but I'm here now,

33:18.300 --> 33:21.173
and I am so sorry.

33:23.218 --> 33:25.177
It's not too late, Mac.

33:25.177 --> 33:27.222
You can still break the cycle.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.780
He's alive.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.567
You did it.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.537
Big feet.

34:21.537 --> 34:23.757
I can't believe
he's still out.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.150
- Yeah.
- He's gonna have

34:25.150 --> 34:26.629
a nasty hangover
when he wakes up.

34:26.629 --> 34:29.284
Well, hopefully it knocks
some sense into him.

34:29.284 --> 34:32.113
John? Sense?

34:32.113 --> 34:33.245
Doubtful.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.298
Thank you for your help.

34:43.298 --> 34:45.605
Yeah.
It's what family's for.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.479
I get it now.

34:50.479 --> 34:53.656
How it must have felt
when Mac turned on you.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.267
Hunting sure knows
how to make a gal

34:55.267 --> 34:57.138
question her morals.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.619
But that doesn't justify
what we did to him.

34:59.619 --> 35:02.404
I've got some making up
to do for that.

35:02.404 --> 35:04.145
How?

35:04.145 --> 35:07.322
Well, I'm gonna start
by taking on the werewolf case

35:07.322 --> 35:10.151
Darla was on when she came
to warn me about Mac.

35:10.151 --> 35:13.676
Might be a good way
to right some of my wrongs.

35:13.676 --> 35:16.679
We'll see where we take it
from there.

35:16.679 --> 35:19.856
So back to hunting, then?
Is that the lesson here?

35:19.856 --> 35:22.163
Is there really no escape?

35:22.163 --> 35:24.339
It's not that you can't escape
the life, Cricket.

35:24.339 --> 35:25.819
You just can't escape

35:25.819 --> 35:27.603
the decisions
you make in that life,

35:27.603 --> 35:29.953
not when you compromise
what you believe in.

35:29.953 --> 35:31.868
But you're better than me,

35:31.868 --> 35:35.524
better than your folks too,
for what it's worth.

35:35.524 --> 35:38.701
So when you finally do
decide to get out,

35:38.701 --> 35:41.182
you're gonna do it
the right way.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.881
Come here.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.513
Are you crying?

36:07.513 --> 36:09.254
Anton touched
this dissected arm.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.864
Are you sure
we have to destroy it?

36:10.864 --> 36:14.476
Carlos, there is absolutely
no reason to keep it.

36:14.476 --> 36:17.262
The soucouyant has been dead
for far too long

36:17.262 --> 36:18.915
for there to be
any remaining essence.

36:18.915 --> 36:20.961
Fine.

36:39.762 --> 36:42.287
Uh, that story
about your father...

36:43.549 --> 36:46.769
I didn't know he was
why you became a pacifist.

36:46.769 --> 36:50.730
It's not really something
I like to talk about.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.427
For what it's worth,

36:52.427 --> 36:54.864
what you did yesterday
was amazing,

36:54.864 --> 36:57.258
because you're right.

36:57.258 --> 37:01.436
You're not a hunter
like Mary, John, or me.

37:01.436 --> 37:04.961
If it was any of us,
we would have killed Mac.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.615
But you...

37:06.615 --> 37:09.052
you helped him.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.666
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.413
Hmm.
- What's that?

37:21.413 --> 37:22.979
It's in Anton's handwriting,

37:22.979 --> 37:25.634
and it's addressed to a Carlos?

37:25.634 --> 37:26.809
- Give me, Lata.
- Say please.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.290
No. No, no, please, give me.

37:32.989 --> 37:36.515
So... what does it say?

37:38.473 --> 37:40.301
That I still got it.

37:42.303 --> 37:46.307
I guess sometimes not flirting
is flirting.

37:51.443 --> 37:52.748
You need to help me
find something to wear.

37:52.748 --> 37:54.402
Oh, my God.
Let's go, come on.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.535
- Oh, my God.
- Faster. Come on.

38:08.503 --> 38:10.331
Morning, sunshine.

38:10.331 --> 38:11.680
Thanks.

38:13.465 --> 38:17.033
Do you remember
anything that happened?

38:17.033 --> 38:18.426
No.

38:19.558 --> 38:22.343
Most of it's
still pretty fuzzy.

38:22.343 --> 38:24.519
The fight that we had--
- It's all right.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.478
I know it wasn't you.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.131
No, I don't mean
the one when I was possessed.

38:31.047 --> 38:34.486
The one before, about Neto.

38:34.486 --> 38:35.965
You were right, Mary.

38:35.965 --> 38:38.838
I have wrestled with anger
my whole life.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.537
And...

38:44.409 --> 38:46.541
I thought
that I'd put it to bed.

38:46.541 --> 38:50.719
The fight with Neto,
it woke it up...

38:50.719 --> 38:52.939
in a way I wasn't expecting.

38:56.725 --> 38:59.380
I have been using you
and hunting as an excuse...

39:01.687 --> 39:03.732
To avoid my problems. I just--

39:03.732 --> 39:06.648
I don't know how to fix it.

39:06.648 --> 39:09.042
I can't--I can't end up
like Mac.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.914
That's not
gonna happen, John.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.525
I promise.

39:15.135 --> 39:17.093
Because I still want
to get out of hunting.

39:17.093 --> 39:19.400
I really do.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.142
But it's not gonna be
at your expense.

39:24.231 --> 39:26.668
You mean too much to me.

39:45.121 --> 39:47.776
What now?

39:47.776 --> 39:49.952
Sorry to interrupt.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.606
That's okay.

39:51.606 --> 39:54.566
How are you feeling?
- Better, yeah.

39:54.566 --> 39:56.872
Um, I just...

39:56.872 --> 39:59.701
wanted to thank you...

39:59.701 --> 40:02.487
for talking Mac down
like you did.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.752
I, uh--

40:06.752 --> 40:10.625
I remember some of the things
that you told him about--

40:10.625 --> 40:13.541
you know, not living
in the anger and the violence.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.457
And I was just wondering...

40:16.457 --> 40:19.721
how do you do that?

40:19.721 --> 40:22.811
I started with meditation,

40:22.811 --> 40:25.118
looking inward,

40:25.118 --> 40:27.903
focusing on positive things

40:27.903 --> 40:31.037
instead of getting caught
in a loop of negativity.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.650
Can you show me
how to do that?

40:35.650 --> 40:37.043
Of course.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.526
Sit.

40:43.528 --> 40:46.226
Cross your legs.
- Yeah.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.536
That's hot.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.059
- There.
- Okay.

40:55.235 --> 40:56.932
Take a deep breath.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.543
Eyes closed.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.547
I am centered.

41:04.853 --> 41:06.638
Just repeat.
- Okay, okay.

41:06.638 --> 41:07.682
Uh, I'm centered.

41:07.682 --> 41:10.685
- I am at peace.
- I am at peace.

41:10.685 --> 41:14.123
- I create my own path.
- I create my own path.

41:14.123 --> 41:15.821
And I walk in it fearlessly.

41:15.821 --> 41:18.214
A-and I walk
in it fearlessly.

41:18.214 --> 41:20.042
<i>Hunting's not for everyone.</i>

41:20.042 --> 41:22.523
<i>You have to be strong,
stay sharp,</i>

41:22.523 --> 41:25.308
<i>make tough decisions,
and it's not easy,</i>

41:25.308 --> 41:29.051
<i>But then again, the righteous
things never are.</i>

41:29.051 --> 41:31.532
- I am centered.
- I am centered.

41:31.532 --> 41:33.665
- I am at peace.
- I'm at peace.

41:33.665 --> 41:35.231
I create my own path--

41:35.231 --> 41:38.191
Can a girl get
any Zen around here?

41:38.191 --> 41:39.714
Meditate later.

41:39.714 --> 41:42.674
My guy from city hall
just got back to me.

41:42.674 --> 41:45.720
We found the Akrida.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.549
That's
where their radio tower is.
