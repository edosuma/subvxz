01:03.740 --> 01:06.625
Ah, look at you,
Cleveland!

01:09.371 --> 01:12.621
Put your hands together for this one.

01:50.367 --> 01:51.945
What say?

02:21.773 --> 02:23.183
From the top!

02:57.557 --> 02:58.586
Yeah!

03:00.475 --> 03:01.554
Thank you.

03:13.445 --> 03:17.194
We love you, Cleveland! Whoo!

03:19.409 --> 03:21.982
- Dudes! Yeah!
- Yeah!

03:22.162 --> 03:25.531
Do you have any idea how
rare that is? That kind of energy...

03:25.707 --> 03:28.162
...coming off the crowd
and feeding us?

03:28.334 --> 03:32.166
And us feeding it right back to them?
That is what it's all about, my brothers.

03:32.338 --> 03:34.710
We are gonna be huge!

03:34.882 --> 03:37.338
- More importantly, how were my moves?
- Those moves.

03:37.510 --> 03:40.510
I got the best seat in the house
between the guitar and bass...

03:40.679 --> 03:43.348
...and you rocked. Yeah!
- Yeah!

03:43.515 --> 03:48.307
- Oh, now, that was classic Vesuvius.
- Billy.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.637
Nice show. Whoo!

03:50.814 --> 03:54.184
- Hey, what did the label say?
- Let's start with some beers first.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.063
Those are on me,
and those are imported.

03:57.236 --> 04:01.235
- Imported. Sounds like good news, right?
- Or bad.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.859
Be right back.
- More like awesome news.

04:07.079 --> 04:10.282
Matchbook Records just offered us
an awesome contract...

04:10.457 --> 04:12.366
...and it is awesome.

04:12.543 --> 04:16.374
- We're gonna be rich!
- I'm gonna get a Fiero.

04:16.546 --> 04:18.668
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.630
There's just one hitch.

04:22.177 --> 04:23.754
They want you to replace Fish.

04:23.928 --> 04:26.384
President of the label
wants his nephew in the band.

04:26.556 --> 04:30.387
Fish is the heart and soul of this band.
We've been together since high school.

04:30.559 --> 04:33.181
- He came up with the name Vesuvius.
- Yeah, he's great.

04:33.354 --> 04:36.723
Guys, they're gonna put money
behind you. That means videos, touring...

04:36.899 --> 04:38.607
No. Forget it, Billy.

04:38.776 --> 04:41.266
We're not gonna sell him out
because some rich kid...

04:41.444 --> 04:44.943
...wants to play rock star. Forget it.
- All right.

04:45.114 --> 04:48.899
I'm calling the head of the label now.
Tell him where he can stick his nephew.

04:49.077 --> 04:51.863
Oh, there was talk of you guys
opening for Whitesnake...

04:52.037 --> 04:54.742
...but sometimes opportunity
knocks twice, right?

04:54.915 --> 04:57.870
- Whitesnake, man.
- Dude, I love that band.

04:58.044 --> 05:02.291
I mean, think about it.
Fish will land on his feet, right?

05:02.465 --> 05:04.172
Like I said, he's a great drummer.

05:04.341 --> 05:06.582
Right. He's gonna be fine.

05:09.012 --> 05:11.301
Billy, hang up that phone.

05:37.081 --> 05:38.111
You traitors!

05:39.833 --> 05:41.789
Start the van, man. He's coming!

05:53.888 --> 05:56.213
We lost him.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.890
- I don't think that went too well.
- What a baby.

06:00.477 --> 06:03.014
- We did it, guys. All right.
- We totally did it.

06:03.187 --> 06:05.679
- That was kind of awesome!
- It's gonna be all right.

06:05.857 --> 06:07.517
I think we lost him.

06:07.693 --> 06:09.899
That's definitely gonna be in a book
about us.

06:10.445 --> 06:12.603
He didn't fit.

06:19.662 --> 06:24.288
After all we've been through?
And you sell me out just like that?

06:26.293 --> 06:29.627
Oh, my God.
He was like a jet plane.

06:29.797 --> 06:31.539
- So fast.
- Fast runner.

06:31.715 --> 06:34.501
- Definitely a fast runner.
- I didn't know how fast he was!

06:34.675 --> 06:35.707
I was going 60.

06:35.885 --> 06:38.377
- He ran like a gazelle, right?
- I was gonna say that.

06:38.555 --> 06:41.045
- Like, his stride was really big.
- Yeah, really big.

06:41.349 --> 06:44.303
Like he'd lived with animals
or something, in the woods.

06:44.728 --> 06:46.849
And he, like, mimicked their... Aah!

06:52.151 --> 06:54.476
Jesus, man, keep going!

06:57.322 --> 06:58.816
Oh, my...

07:02.368 --> 07:04.242
We gotta shake him loose, man!

07:12.462 --> 07:16.245
I will drag you down to hell with me.
I will eat your souls.

07:16.423 --> 07:18.048
Hit the brakes, man!

07:22.470 --> 07:24.593
Oh, my God, Kerr. You killed him.

07:25.599 --> 07:27.307
You killed him.

07:27.476 --> 07:29.682
He deserved it, man.

07:30.645 --> 07:32.388
He's dead.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.640
He can't be killed.

07:40.029 --> 07:42.188
Dude, he can't be killed.
He can't be killed.

07:42.365 --> 07:44.855
Back it up, back it up.

07:46.493 --> 07:47.869
He's a zombie!

07:50.247 --> 07:51.871
I don't need you!

07:52.040 --> 07:55.076
I'm gonna be 10 times bigger
than you! No!

07:55.251 --> 07:58.038
A billion times bigger than you! No!

07:58.212 --> 08:01.582
Eleventy billion, trillion...

08:01.967 --> 08:06.378
<i>... vermillion times bigger than you!</i>

08:10.725 --> 08:13.891
Jeez, this would be a great album
if I could ever listen to it.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.184
New Vesuvius, fellas.

08:16.355 --> 08:20.933
Waited in line two hours last night
to get it. Supposed to be amazing.

08:21.109 --> 08:24.941
Everybody thought they peaked
when their sixth album went platinum...

08:25.114 --> 08:26.821
...but then they came back...

08:26.990 --> 08:29.741
...and blew the doors off
with <i>Devil's Nursery.</i>

08:29.909 --> 08:33.158
<i>- Devil's Nursery</i> rocks.
- Look at those faces.

08:33.328 --> 08:36.864
It's the etchings of time, man.
These guys have really lived, you know?

08:37.041 --> 08:39.533
Yeah, I know.

08:39.708 --> 08:42.580
Oh, you a fan?
I mean, how could you not be, right?

08:42.754 --> 08:45.625
I don't really listen
to heavy-metal music.

08:45.799 --> 08:49.548
- Oh, dude, you gotta hear this.
- No, I don't.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.551
- No, seriously, if you've never heard...
- Seriously, I'm not interested.

08:53.723 --> 08:56.677
Trust me. One track,
you're gonna be hooked for life.

08:56.851 --> 08:59.852
- Zammit's Metal Racking.
- Hello, Zammit's Metal Racking. What?

09:00.021 --> 09:01.681
You wanna hear the new Vesuvius?

09:07.069 --> 09:09.476
Yeah. It's sweet, huh?

09:09.655 --> 09:11.861
I'll burn you a copy.

09:13.409 --> 09:15.530
Can you hold, please?

10:10.004 --> 10:12.493
<i>Do not tell me that this was</i>
<i>about them.</i>

10:12.671 --> 10:17.251
Well, as it happens, by coincidence,
it was the new album...

10:17.427 --> 10:19.219
...by Vesuvius.

10:19.388 --> 10:21.545
- Damn it, Rob.
- Which is terrible, by the way.

10:21.723 --> 10:26.218
- Totally overproduced.
- Really? Okay, look. Rob.

10:26.394 --> 10:29.430
I know that we've been through this
a whole bunch...

10:29.605 --> 10:31.930
...and I know you think
you're getting past it...

10:32.108 --> 10:35.724
...but this is not getting past it.
It has been 20 years. Let it go.

10:35.902 --> 10:36.933
I have let it go...

10:37.112 --> 10:39.947
...and the universe keeps shoving
Vesuvius back in my face.

10:40.115 --> 10:43.815
Look, guppy, I don't think
I can do this anymore.

10:43.994 --> 10:47.742
This just isn't working for me.
I'm sorry. I think it's time...

10:47.913 --> 10:49.740
- I break up with you.
- What?

10:49.915 --> 10:51.659
- I break up with you. l...
- No.

10:51.834 --> 10:53.210
- No!
- Yes.

10:53.377 --> 10:55.085
- What?
- What were you gonna say?

10:55.254 --> 10:58.207
- I interrupted you.
- You just said what I was gonna say.

10:58.381 --> 11:00.042
I am breaking up with you,
so quiet.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.339
I am fantastic.
You don't break up with me.

11:02.510 --> 11:05.180
I'm gonna have to ask you
to pack your things and leave.

11:05.889 --> 11:07.633
This is my apartment.

11:28.535 --> 11:29.781
<i>This is gonna be great.</i>

11:29.954 --> 11:34.615
A fresh start, you know,
get my life back on track.

11:34.791 --> 11:36.998
That's the attitude, Robert.
- Thanks, sis.

11:37.169 --> 11:39.042
So you'll be on your feet...

11:39.212 --> 11:41.454
...and out of this house
in what, about a week?

11:41.631 --> 11:45.544
- Lisa, come on. Give the guy a break.
- Thank you, Stan.

11:45.717 --> 11:50.047
Talk about your missed opportunity.
Imagine if he was still in Vesuvius.

11:50.222 --> 11:52.511
My brother-in-law in Vesuvius.

11:52.683 --> 11:54.306
Know what our lives would be like?

11:54.475 --> 11:56.433
I'd be wearing silk underwear
right now.

11:56.603 --> 11:58.263
It's like winning the lottery...

11:58.438 --> 12:01.605
...and having the lottery ticket
ripped up in front of your face.

12:01.775 --> 12:02.889
Thank you, Stan.

12:03.068 --> 12:06.352
Thought we weren't supposed to use
the V-word in front of Uncle Rob.

12:06.528 --> 12:07.904
He can take it.

12:08.155 --> 12:10.860
So have you heard? Matt got into MIT.

12:11.033 --> 12:12.492
- Oh.
- That's my boy.

12:12.660 --> 12:15.945
That makes sense. Last time I saw you,
you were building a robot.

12:16.122 --> 12:17.948
How'd that ever work out?

12:18.123 --> 12:21.326
That was eight years ago,
when I was 10.

12:23.044 --> 12:25.168
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Ha!

12:25.339 --> 12:28.457
Maybe you want to take a can
of shut up.

12:28.883 --> 12:33.711
Matt is also in a band,
playing the prom.

12:33.888 --> 12:36.758
- The only way he'd ever get to go.
- Hey.

12:36.933 --> 12:41.511
I swear if you don't stop annoying me,
I'm gonna shave your head in your sleep.

12:41.812 --> 12:43.270
I'd still be the pretty child.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.733
Matt.
- Violet, Matt, stop it.

12:46.901 --> 12:49.438
A band, huh?
So, what do you call yourselves?

12:49.611 --> 12:51.318
A.D.D.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.193
Add? Huh.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.570
- Well, it's short.
- What?

12:55.742 --> 12:56.773
Easy to remember.

12:56.993 --> 13:02.200
No. It's A.D.D.,
as in attention deficit disorder.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.664
Oh, good, you changed it,
because "Add" really blew.

13:09.964 --> 13:11.623
Robby, you know I love you...

13:11.799 --> 13:14.752
...but letting you stay here
isn't gonna solve your problems.

13:14.926 --> 13:17.252
Of course.
Just ditch me, like everyone else has.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.386
It's called tough love, kid.

13:19.556 --> 13:22.640
But what about the sweet love,
where you say, " Hey...

13:22.809 --> 13:27.020
...stay as long as you want, and here's
some cash so you can fix your car."

13:27.271 --> 13:29.180
- In your dreams, pal.
- Sis, come on.

13:29.357 --> 13:31.812
I'm feeling really good about
the future, you know?

13:31.984 --> 13:33.443
Like all of this is... Ah!

13:37.990 --> 13:39.020
Robert?

13:43.120 --> 13:46.619
Where is Jeremy? I swear,
I am gonna kill him when he shows up.

13:49.041 --> 13:52.043
Here he comes, with his mom.

13:54.380 --> 13:57.168
Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy's Mom.

13:57.342 --> 14:00.543
Hey, guys. So I kind of got suspended
from school today...

14:00.719 --> 14:02.094
...and I can't play prom.

14:02.596 --> 14:05.800
- Wait. What?
- Tell them what you did, Jeremy.

14:05.975 --> 14:09.059
I kind of brought hash brownies
to the Spanish Club luncheon.

14:09.978 --> 14:11.520
- Not <i>bueno.</i>
- And?

14:11.688 --> 14:14.475
And Señorita Horowitz
kind of got really stoned...

14:14.649 --> 14:16.226
...and passed out
in the locker room.

14:16.401 --> 14:17.432
And?

14:18.069 --> 14:23.489
And somebody kind of drew a, uh...

14:24.116 --> 14:25.147
A penis.

14:25.326 --> 14:27.864
A penis on a grown woman's face.

14:28.037 --> 14:29.910
And now he can't walk
during graduation.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.828
Every mother's dream.
Let's go, Jeremy.

14:34.167 --> 14:37.168
See you guys. Rock hard.

14:37.337 --> 14:38.368
A penis.

14:39.756 --> 14:43.172
- Prom is in two days.
- Not for us, it's not.

14:43.343 --> 14:44.670
You know what?

14:44.843 --> 14:46.302
Blessing in disguise.

14:46.470 --> 14:49.044
Who wants to play
some crappy school dance anyway?

14:49.224 --> 14:51.631
I do. And so do you.

14:51.809 --> 14:54.894
- Whatever.
- I could ask my uncle.

14:55.063 --> 14:58.726
- I don't think we're that desperate.
- He was an original member of Vesuvius.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.354
- I bet he can still play.
- Yeah, but he's ancient.

15:01.527 --> 15:03.935
Let's start looking for a new drummer.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.497
Yeah, so am I in?

15:47.986 --> 15:50.988
- Hey, wh...
- Sorry, Uncle Rob. Were we too loud?

15:51.157 --> 15:55.236
"Too loud" is not in my vocabulary.
How dare you?

15:55.410 --> 16:00.156
- Excuse me?
- How dare you call yourself a musician?

16:00.916 --> 16:03.038
Loads of bands use drum loops.

16:03.501 --> 16:06.835
Loads of elevators play Celine Dion.
That don't make it right.

16:07.463 --> 16:10.084
Now get your devil box out of here.

16:11.551 --> 16:13.378
Move it, Moby Dick.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.468
Go.

16:20.017 --> 16:21.428
My work here is done.

16:28.358 --> 16:31.394
- That's your uncle.
- That's my uncle.

16:32.278 --> 16:34.948
We've kind of exhausted
all our other options, so...

16:35.115 --> 16:40.700
- I don't have any better ideas.
- Okay, fine. Go talk to him.

16:43.873 --> 16:45.865
Hey, Uncle Rob, can I talk to you?

16:47.251 --> 16:49.493
I will not buy beer for you
and your friends...

16:49.670 --> 16:51.661
...nor rent you my password
to porn sites.

16:51.838 --> 16:54.756
Rent...? No, no. I was...

16:54.924 --> 16:59.385
I was actually just wondering
if you'd play with us at our prom gig.

17:04.559 --> 17:06.136
What did you just say?

17:06.310 --> 17:10.640
I was wondering if you'd play the drums
with us, just for one night.

17:10.815 --> 17:13.020
Absolutely not.

17:13.191 --> 17:17.236
I haven't played the drums in 20 years.
Drumming is pain...

17:17.404 --> 17:19.693
...and I've had more than enough pain
for one lifetime.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.691
Look.

17:22.576 --> 17:25.148
Come... Just meet me up here.

17:25.328 --> 17:28.412
We need a drummer, okay?
And you play the drums.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.037
You've been a pretty terrible uncle
over the years.

17:31.209 --> 17:34.827
Yeah, you only come by when you
need something from my mom.

17:35.004 --> 17:38.254
You never remember my birthday.
You called me Max until I was 11.

17:38.882 --> 17:41.337
Okay, what's your point, Matt?

17:42.344 --> 17:43.507
This is...

17:43.679 --> 17:47.261
This is really, really important to me.

17:47.641 --> 17:51.305
I'm not what you would call
a social butterfly.

17:51.477 --> 17:53.102
You know?

17:53.271 --> 17:55.393
Playing this gig...

17:55.565 --> 17:58.648
...is probably the closest I'm ever
gonna get to...

17:58.817 --> 18:02.317
...breaking the ice with, you know,
the ladies.

18:02.863 --> 18:06.113
You're looking to score.
I can respect that.

18:06.283 --> 18:09.487
Anyway, if you really are my uncle...

18:09.660 --> 18:11.534
...my family...

18:11.704 --> 18:14.872
...you will do this one thing for me.

18:32.599 --> 18:35.719
- Matt, where is he?
- He said he would be here.

18:35.894 --> 18:39.393
He doesn't know the songs,
and I thought he'd be here early.

18:39.564 --> 18:42.566
He said he didn't need to,
he could play with us in his sleep.

18:42.735 --> 18:46.601
He said he feeds on God juice
and miracles spring forth.

18:47.655 --> 18:54.536
Never fear, <i>niños.</i> Got our laminates.
All access. Drives the chicks wild.

18:54.704 --> 18:56.862
Hey, are you ready?
We're on in five minutes.

18:57.039 --> 19:00.205
Five minutes? What? We're headlining.
We shouldn't go on till 11.

19:00.375 --> 19:03.127
It's the prom. It's over at 11.

19:03.629 --> 19:08.254
Wait. So we're on in five minutes?
Seriously, five minutes?

19:09.008 --> 19:10.253
Okay.

19:10.760 --> 19:14.211
Wow. That's... Five minutes.
Eye of the tiger.

19:14.388 --> 19:16.428
Bang a gong, get it on. Bang a gong.

19:16.599 --> 19:20.383
Get it on, all night long, bang a gong,
get it on. Rock me, Amadeus.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.861
Oh!

19:31.071 --> 19:35.566
- I'm gonna be so sick.
- A little pre-show ritual.

19:38.119 --> 19:40.954
- Did you just...?
- Lucky charm.

19:41.122 --> 19:43.957
Some people carry a rabbit's foot,
I rock a pocket of puke.

19:45.459 --> 19:49.161
Now, ladies and gentlemen, A.D.D.

19:49.338 --> 19:50.501
Follow my lead.

19:51.674 --> 19:52.871
One, two, three.

20:55.442 --> 20:58.396
A.D. D, ladies and gentlemen. A.D.D.

20:58.654 --> 21:02.152
Now it's time for your prom king
and queen's first dance.

22:11.346 --> 22:13.089
Stop. Stop.

22:24.609 --> 22:29.436
Woo-hoo! Rock and roll.
Thank you, Cleveland!

22:32.741 --> 22:35.446
Yeah! What a show! Come on.
Mattie, chest bump.

22:35.619 --> 22:38.786
Here we go.
How awesomely sweet was that?

22:38.956 --> 22:42.574
Oh, yeah, if by awesomely sweet,
you mean a horrific train wreck...

22:42.751 --> 22:46.535
...we will never live down, then, yeah,
it was super awesomely sweet.

22:46.713 --> 22:50.876
It was like that scene in <i>Titanic.</i>
You know, the one where they all die.

22:51.050 --> 22:53.589
What? We rocked
the balls off that place!

22:53.762 --> 22:56.845
- You are delusional.
- You got that right, sourpuss.

22:57.014 --> 23:01.012
You know what else? A.D.D. just landed
itself a new bricklaying drummer...

23:01.185 --> 23:04.768
...and his name is Fish.

23:04.939 --> 23:06.978
Dude. Wake up.

23:07.149 --> 23:11.526
You just ruined that show and you're
never playing with this band again.

23:13.029 --> 23:14.440
Thanks.

23:39.846 --> 23:41.554
Hello.
- Hello.

23:41.723 --> 23:45.173
Is Curtis at home?
- Who is asking?

23:46.060 --> 23:49.429
Robert. Fishman.

23:49.606 --> 23:52.309
- My friends call me Fish.
- Fish.

23:52.482 --> 23:56.944
I'm the drummer in the band
from the...

23:57.363 --> 23:58.643
From the prom.

23:58.989 --> 24:00.269
Oh.

24:00.449 --> 24:04.280
Oh, you're serious. Oh, wow.
Okay, I'm sorry.

24:04.494 --> 24:08.408
Curtis said that the drummer was older.
I just... I figured college.

24:09.040 --> 24:14.117
- So and you're his older sister?
- That's very flattering. No, I'm his mom.

24:15.045 --> 24:17.501
No, you're not. Seriously, you're not.

24:17.673 --> 24:18.954
What is your name?

24:19.467 --> 24:22.752
Well, usually, Curtis's little friends
call me Ms. Powell.

24:23.637 --> 24:25.962
- Ms. Powell?
- Mm-hm.

24:26.139 --> 24:28.096
There's the cutest little jazz club...

24:28.266 --> 24:31.516
You know, I'm sorry.
I just don't date my son's friends.

24:31.686 --> 24:33.062
You know? It's just icky.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.138
- Right. Yeah.
- Kids are in the back.

24:37.067 --> 24:40.435
Uh, Curtis? Honey?
Your play date's here.

24:40.612 --> 24:43.861
So sweetie, what time is your mom
picking you up?

24:44.615 --> 24:46.407
You're hysterical.

24:46.576 --> 24:50.275
You have no idea. I'll see you guys.

24:51.037 --> 24:53.493
If it isn't the one-man band.

24:54.750 --> 24:55.780
Okay.

24:57.669 --> 24:58.998
Look.

24:59.171 --> 25:02.124
I haven't played in front
of an audience in 20 years...

25:02.298 --> 25:05.169
...and so maybe, possibly...

25:05.343 --> 25:08.629
...I got a little carried away
and out of control, and I'm sorry.

25:09.222 --> 25:11.890
But I can make it up to you.
What if I told you...

25:12.057 --> 25:16.518
...I could get us a gig?
- I'd say you're full of shit.

25:16.687 --> 25:20.767
Oh, whoa. Curtis, 1991 called.
They want their teenage angst back.

25:20.941 --> 25:24.807
Oh, my God, they just called again.
They want that joke back.

25:25.236 --> 25:30.741
Hang on. A gig?
Like when U2 plays and everybody's like:

25:30.909 --> 25:33.696
"Yeah, U2! I love you."

25:33.870 --> 25:37.654
Yes. These songs need
to be heard, man. Seriously!

25:37.832 --> 25:39.373
Who writes these songs, anyway?

25:41.293 --> 25:43.701
- I do.
- Abandonment issues.

25:43.880 --> 25:46.084
Daddy bailed when he was 4, so...

25:46.255 --> 25:50.633
Well, there's a crazy mojo working
with Mr. Dark and Broody there...

25:50.802 --> 25:52.711
...and me likey.

25:52.887 --> 25:54.964
So what do you say
we lay down tracks...

25:55.140 --> 25:59.089
...with Uncle Fish at the kit,
and let me run with it?

26:01.312 --> 26:05.262
- All right, band meeting.
- Okay. Huddle up.

26:05.441 --> 26:08.856
No, just us three. The band.

26:10.862 --> 26:13.650
Yeah. I'll be in my office.

26:16.493 --> 26:19.862
Okay, perhaps last night
he was a bit ostentatious...

26:20.038 --> 26:24.664
...with his performance style, but you
can't deny the fact that he's got chops.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.789
- No way, man. I told him he's out.
- You can't deny it.

26:28.130 --> 26:31.295
All right, you guys.
Let's just think about it like this.

26:31.465 --> 26:34.669
It might be kind of cool...

26:34.844 --> 26:37.417
...you know, if he were in the band.
We'd have it all:

26:37.596 --> 26:40.218
The magnetic
but tormented lead singer...

26:40.391 --> 26:43.924
...the awkward, neurotic, super-nerd...
- That's me. That's me.

26:44.185 --> 26:48.230
...the kind of ironic, postmodern
you know, punk girl...

26:48.398 --> 26:51.102
...and the ancient
crazy-faces-making rocker.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.601
You can't tell me
you've seen anything like that.

26:53.779 --> 26:58.772
- For good reason. This isn't a joke to me.
- You think it is to us?

27:00.409 --> 27:02.283
What have we got to lose?

27:03.454 --> 27:07.118
All right. If he delivers a gig,
I'll give him a chance.

27:15.048 --> 27:17.290
Woo-hoo! Yes.

27:17.759 --> 27:19.169
Hello, Concrete Jungle?

27:19.343 --> 27:20.422
Galardy's Bar & Grill.

27:20.594 --> 27:25.552
Oh, hi. Is this the Hi-Fi Club?
I played there in 1985 with Vesuvius.

27:25.724 --> 27:29.259
I am with the band A.D.D.
I have a demo.

27:29.436 --> 27:32.390
I have a new band.
It's called A... Hello?

27:32.564 --> 27:35.234
We have not yet rocked Akron.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.402
Yes, do you have auditions?
Thank you.

27:38.571 --> 27:40.194
Thank you. You're closed?

27:40.363 --> 27:42.652
Okay. I'll try back.

27:46.244 --> 27:48.865
Oh, what are you doing here?

27:49.205 --> 27:50.403
I'm working on a song.

27:50.582 --> 27:53.783
Oh, uh-oh. Look out, everybody.
Genius at work.

27:53.959 --> 27:56.996
Lennon and McCartney
rolled into one.

27:57.171 --> 28:00.837
- I'd like to get back to work.
- How many songs in that book?

28:01.800 --> 28:04.469
Probably 211.

28:04.636 --> 28:05.715
Wow.

28:05.887 --> 28:08.460
That's like 500 albums.

28:08.639 --> 28:13.551
I was never so much of a songwriter.
More of a name-the-band kind of guy.

28:13.728 --> 28:17.725
Different skill set. Still important.
Can I look at what you are writing?

28:19.317 --> 28:23.694
Dude, we are a band, okay?
Bands share everything.

28:23.863 --> 28:28.358
- Deodorant. Buses. Chicks.
- I'd just rather not.

28:28.534 --> 28:31.700
- We're like a family.
- No.

28:31.870 --> 28:33.946
I'll be gentle.

28:35.291 --> 28:36.866
Okay.

28:43.506 --> 28:46.211
- These are some great lyrics.
- Thank you.

28:46.718 --> 28:49.386
"Tomorrow never comes."

28:49.553 --> 28:53.052
So true. I don't understand it,
but that's heavy, man.

28:53.223 --> 28:55.928
- Thanks.
- That's good stuff.

28:56.101 --> 28:57.300
Thank you.

28:58.019 --> 29:00.510
So your dad took off
when you were just a little kid?

29:01.564 --> 29:04.482
Mm. That must have been tough.

29:05.359 --> 29:07.020
You miss what you never knew.

29:11.324 --> 29:13.031
- What are you doing?
- That's good.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.572
- "You miss what you never knew."
- It is? You like it?

29:15.744 --> 29:18.746
- Yeah.
- And you can have it, gratis.

29:18.915 --> 29:21.286
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:21.834 --> 29:22.912
Are you gonna finish that?

29:23.084 --> 29:25.077
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

29:27.255 --> 29:29.248
- So any luck getting us a gig?
- Yeah.

29:29.716 --> 29:31.875
It's just about finding
the right showcase.

29:32.052 --> 29:35.467
It's just focusing
on the perfect showcase.

29:35.638 --> 29:37.512
No one likes the demo.

29:37.682 --> 29:40.600
I mean, it's stupid to think anybody
but me would be into it.

29:40.768 --> 29:44.433
What? This music is great,
and I can prove it.

29:44.605 --> 29:46.728
- How?
- Let's ride.

29:48.066 --> 29:51.067
This, my friend,
is called the drive test.

29:52.154 --> 29:54.940
If we can drive around
with no place to go...

29:55.115 --> 29:59.741
...blast the music, and feel like we're
on top of the world...

29:59.911 --> 30:02.532
...then we know
we're onto something.

30:08.753 --> 30:09.783
Sing it.

30:16.468 --> 30:18.046
Like you mean it!

30:18.262 --> 30:19.921
Come on.

30:29.064 --> 30:30.095
Right?

30:36.070 --> 30:40.020
How do you come up with
those rhymes? "Busted, trusted."

30:40.199 --> 30:43.199
I don't know how you come up with it.
I like this part.

30:47.664 --> 30:52.242
Isn't it something, Cleveland?
A.D. D!

30:52.418 --> 30:54.743
- This guy!
- And this guy!

30:54.920 --> 30:57.376
- Mosh pit!
- Mosh?

31:00.009 --> 31:01.384
Slam dance!

31:02.970 --> 31:07.548
It does make you feel invincible, huh?
Like everything is possible now!

31:07.724 --> 31:08.887
And you know what?

31:09.059 --> 31:12.511
If we can bring that to an audience,
even for four and a half minutes...

31:12.688 --> 31:14.265
...then we've got something.

31:15.023 --> 31:16.137
Give me your phone.

31:18.735 --> 31:21.652
Make it turn into a camera.

31:21.821 --> 31:24.277
- That? Okay.
- Yeah.

31:24.449 --> 31:28.066
Give me a rebel yell on three.
Three, two, one!

31:30.162 --> 31:33.448
That is the moment we knew
we were gonna be huge.

31:34.125 --> 31:35.499
Whoo!

31:38.170 --> 31:39.829
Hello?

31:40.213 --> 31:42.454
Yeah, hold on a sec. Robert!

31:43.841 --> 31:45.419
Ow!
- Robert!

31:45.593 --> 31:46.673
I'm busy.

31:46.845 --> 31:49.300
- Phone!
- Jeez.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.263
Now.

31:54.685 --> 31:55.966
I think it's about a job.

31:56.144 --> 31:59.680
How could it not be about a job?

31:59.857 --> 32:02.145
One of those ones I've been
looking so hard for.

32:02.317 --> 32:06.065
Hello, this is Fish. What?

32:07.489 --> 32:10.822
What? Yeah! No, hold on.
Hold on.

32:12.786 --> 32:13.983
Yeah.

32:16.956 --> 32:20.491
- Gone... That's what I did.
- Yeah, but you sing the harmony.

32:24.422 --> 32:26.045
Oh, jeez.

32:27.549 --> 32:29.341
That needs to be fixed.

32:30.135 --> 32:32.341
God.
- I have news...

32:33.013 --> 32:35.800
...but you know what?
Before I reveal said news...

32:35.974 --> 32:40.018
...we need to work on some things,
including stage presence.

32:40.895 --> 32:44.810
Why? Because A.D.D. has a gig.

32:45.317 --> 32:47.060
- What?
- A gig?

32:47.235 --> 32:48.645
A gig! Yes!

32:48.819 --> 32:50.397
- Whoo!
- Yes!

32:50.571 --> 32:53.571
We are playing the Tiger Room
in Fort Wayne, Indiana...

32:53.740 --> 32:59.079
...Saturday night. We are hitting
the "muh-huh-fuh-ing" road.

32:59.246 --> 33:01.072
Oh, Indiana.

33:01.247 --> 33:03.121
My mom's not gonna let me
go to Indiana.

33:03.291 --> 33:06.577
- No, my mom's not gonna let me go.
- Listen up, kiddies.

33:06.753 --> 33:09.125
You don't ask your parents
for permission to rock.

33:09.297 --> 33:11.788
You think The Beatles went to
their mums and dads:

33:12.049 --> 33:13.959
"Hello, Mum. Hello, Dad.

33:14.135 --> 33:16.423
May I have permission to go
with my mates...

33:16.595 --> 33:19.003
...to a little pub
called Shea Stadium...

33:19.182 --> 33:22.098
...and rock the world
for the rest of eternity?" No!

33:22.267 --> 33:26.265
They were adults! You're an ad...
They were adults.

33:26.438 --> 33:30.138
- What about the church-retreat excuse?
- What's that?

33:30.317 --> 33:34.396
It's like, " Mom, Dad, I really wanna go
on this church retreat...

33:34.571 --> 33:37.606
...that I heard about so that I can learn
about the Bible...

33:37.782 --> 33:43.238
...you know, and meet other teenagers
who share my interest in the Bible."

33:43.412 --> 33:45.737
- Ha. This works?
- Yeah.

33:45.914 --> 33:48.121
You just print up a fake flyer
on Photoshop...

33:48.292 --> 33:50.617
...show it to your parents,
and you're at a show.

33:51.128 --> 33:53.880
Give it up
right now, daughter of Beelzebub.

33:54.048 --> 33:55.542
Hit me.

33:55.715 --> 33:58.502
Nothing. Nothing.
You're a tough cookie...

33:58.676 --> 34:00.965
...but I'm gonna get a smile
out of you yet.

34:01.137 --> 34:02.929
Smiling is for the weak.

34:04.557 --> 34:07.344
I can't believe
we're stealing my mom's car.

34:07.601 --> 34:10.271
It's not stealing when you're family.

34:10.438 --> 34:12.809
But still, don't tell your mom.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.603
Hop in.

34:14.942 --> 34:16.935
I'm so nervous.

34:33.500 --> 34:38.080
- Did you just sneeze on my face?
- No, that wasn't me.

34:39.047 --> 34:40.079
What you working on?

34:40.257 --> 34:43.792
You going to ask to hear something
every time you see me writing?

34:43.969 --> 34:45.761
Pretty much, yep.

34:46.472 --> 34:48.760
- It's called "Bitter."
- Butter?

34:48.931 --> 34:50.676
"Bitter."

34:50.851 --> 34:52.049
It's a song?

34:52.226 --> 34:54.349
- Yeah, it's a song.
- Let's hear some.

34:56.313 --> 34:57.345
It goes:

35:21.546 --> 35:22.956
And it goes on like that.

35:23.131 --> 35:26.582
Well, the cyanide and razor blades
are in the glove box. Help yourself.

35:26.760 --> 35:29.677
- Come on. Hey. Hey. Hey.
- What?

35:30.220 --> 35:32.260
It's really good stuff. It's like poetry.

35:32.431 --> 35:36.050
I just wanna say, I am so excited
we're on the road.

35:36.311 --> 35:38.765
We are doing it.
We're living our dream.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.558
This is it. This is what it's about,
living our dream.

35:41.732 --> 35:44.269
You know, we don't stop.
We don't stop for anything. We just...

35:45.652 --> 35:47.811
I'd better stop.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.940
Come on, Robert. Let's go.

35:50.114 --> 35:52.106
I can't believe you called
the cops on me.

35:52.283 --> 35:54.988
- You stole my car, Robert.
- I topped off your fluids.

35:55.161 --> 35:56.192
Oh, get a job!

35:56.371 --> 35:58.943
I had a job, an awesome gig
that was gonna pay $ 100...

35:59.123 --> 36:02.408
...until you reported your car missing.
- Oh, take responsibility!

36:02.584 --> 36:03.616
You!

36:03.794 --> 36:05.620
- So long, Mattie.
- So long...

36:05.795 --> 36:07.919
Don't talk!
You are not allowed to speak!

36:08.090 --> 36:09.549
You are not allowed to drive...

36:09.717 --> 36:12.386
In fact, to do anything
for the rest of the summer.

36:12.551 --> 36:15.636
You can take away the wheels
and his right to free speech...

36:15.805 --> 36:17.597
...but you cannot take away
the dream.

36:17.766 --> 36:18.964
Damn right.

36:19.142 --> 36:22.926
Shut up, Stan.
Get out of my house, Robert.

36:23.104 --> 36:25.429
Hey, Fish, Fish, Fish. Listen.

36:25.606 --> 36:28.061
I'm really sorry she made me drop
a dime on you.

36:28.233 --> 36:30.107
It's okay, buddy.

36:30.277 --> 36:34.109
Hey, give me the heavy-metal
devil horns.

36:34.406 --> 36:36.398
Now lock them with me.

36:36.991 --> 36:39.068
My brother.

36:48.794 --> 36:51.368
Oh, man, thanks for letting me
stay here, Mr. Lee.

36:51.547 --> 36:57.003
I really appreciate it.
Yeah, those rice bags look comfortable.

36:57.386 --> 37:00.340
Fish, no one has eaten
more takeout than you.

37:00.514 --> 37:02.422
You put my kids through college.

37:02.599 --> 37:04.757
You stay until you get
back on your feet, huh?

37:05.602 --> 37:06.717
Thanks, Mr. Lee.

37:08.647 --> 37:12.644
Wow. That heat is tremendous.

37:13.484 --> 37:14.516
Take this.

37:16.654 --> 37:19.026
- What's this for?
- For the rats.

37:19.741 --> 37:20.772
Rats?

37:31.710 --> 37:33.120
Uncle Rob?

37:38.633 --> 37:40.958
Hey. Hey, I thought
you were grounded.

37:41.135 --> 37:43.970
Technically, I'm at the library
for the next 10 minutes.

37:44.221 --> 37:46.628
But I'm not, really. I'm here.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.474
Phew.

37:48.642 --> 37:51.015
It's uncomfortably hot down here.

37:51.229 --> 37:54.015
So, what brings you
to the House of Lee?

37:55.024 --> 37:57.479
I have a way...

37:57.651 --> 38:00.355
...we can still practice.

38:03.323 --> 38:06.655
<i>So I've taken four webcams...</i>

38:06.909 --> 38:10.989
<i>... then interfaced our computers</i>
<i>to create a non-delayed...</i>

38:11.163 --> 38:13.156
<i>... real-time virtual network.</i>

38:13.333 --> 38:15.455
<i>Hello? Is this thing on?</i>

38:15.626 --> 38:17.286
<i>- Can you hear us?</i>
<i>- Is this working?</i>

38:17.461 --> 38:18.492
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

38:19.421 --> 38:22.671
Mike check. Check. Can you hear me?

38:23.425 --> 38:24.456
<i>This thing on?</i>

38:25.844 --> 38:28.335
<i>- It's a camera, it's not a mike.</i>
<i>- I can hear you.</i>

38:28.513 --> 38:30.339
<i>- We can hear you.</i>
<i>- Okay, let's do this.</i>

38:30.514 --> 38:31.795
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh, wow.</i>

38:31.974 --> 38:34.051
- Oh!
<i>- It's not a mike, Uncle Rob.</i>

38:34.227 --> 38:35.970
<i>What?</i>
<i>- Is anybody else seeing this?</i>

38:36.145 --> 38:37.308
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

38:37.480 --> 38:40.185
<i>Am I the only one seeing this?</i>
<i>Why is no one else reacting?</i>

38:40.358 --> 38:43.227
<i>- Try "Tomorrow Never Comes."</i>
<i>- Curtis, are you watching this?</i>

38:43.401 --> 38:45.975
<i>- Okay, "Tomorrow Never Comes."</i>
<i>- This is sick. Fish.</i>

38:47.615 --> 38:49.903
- Oh, God. Okay.
<i>- Okay, here we go.</i>

38:50.534 --> 38:55.741
<i>One, two, one, two, three, four...</i>

39:17.809 --> 39:20.929
No. Yeah. I know, I keep trying to
download the homework...

39:21.104 --> 39:24.224
...but my annoying brother
is hogging all the bandwidth.

39:24.400 --> 39:28.063
Some stupid practice in our garage.

39:29.070 --> 39:32.355
Hang on. I'll call you back.

39:38.162 --> 39:41.115
Hello, YouTube.

39:41.873 --> 39:45.574
Oh, dude, this is that thing
they were talking about on Stern.

39:45.753 --> 39:49.167
Holy shit. I think that's Robert.

39:49.338 --> 39:51.664
<i>What next, guys?</i>
- Oh, that's a lot of Robert.

39:51.841 --> 39:53.039
<i>What do you wanna do next?</i>

39:53.926 --> 39:55.420
Leon, come here, come here.

39:55.595 --> 39:58.382
That's... This guy's hilarious.

39:58.556 --> 39:59.755
That's my brother-in-law.

39:59.933 --> 40:02.422
- The song's pretty g...
<i>- Taking a little noodle break.</i>

40:02.601 --> 40:04.926
Just had dinner with him.
- Get out of here.

40:06.564 --> 40:10.644
Ahem. You want to share this
with the rest of the class, huh?

40:10.818 --> 40:12.228
Oh. What is that?

40:12.402 --> 40:14.146
<i>What's next? Let's keep going.</i>

40:14.321 --> 40:16.858
- <i>Let's keep up this energy.</i>
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

40:17.031 --> 40:18.609
Oh, God. Okay.

40:29.459 --> 40:31.536
I'm telling you,
that's the naked drummer.

40:31.712 --> 40:35.294
Are you sure, man? It's kind of
hard to tell with his clothes on.

40:38.718 --> 40:40.711
It is the naked drummer.

40:45.267 --> 40:47.140
Hey, fam.
I got here as fast as I could.

40:47.393 --> 40:50.098
There he is. I don't recognize you
with clothes on.

40:52.022 --> 40:54.893
David Marshall, head of A and R
for Matchbook Records.

40:55.401 --> 40:57.026
Matchbook Records?

40:57.195 --> 41:01.144
By the way, I'm Stan.
I'm kind of with the band.

41:01.323 --> 41:02.438
Great, great.

41:02.616 --> 41:05.652
He's come all the way from Los Angeles
to meet you, Robert.

41:06.161 --> 41:08.320
We're on the Internet. On the Internet.

41:08.497 --> 41:10.121
Over a million hits and counting.

41:15.295 --> 41:18.082
- You know what that sound is? Anybody?
- No.

41:18.256 --> 41:20.165
What about you, Norm from <i>Cheers?</i>

41:20.340 --> 41:23.460
That's the sound of the money truck
backing up to your door.

41:23.636 --> 41:26.470
But my team at Matchbook,
we see more than money.

41:26.638 --> 41:28.797
We see beyond the gimmick
of the naked drummer.

41:28.974 --> 41:31.891
It's a fun video.
We're laughing at it, laughing...

41:32.060 --> 41:35.594
...but then we're humming the songs.
It's the rope-a-dope.

41:35.772 --> 41:41.062
Know what I mean? The rope-a-dope.
We're laughing, laughing, then boom!

41:41.235 --> 41:44.984
Out of nowhere, we're singing
and humming the tunes. Why?

41:45.156 --> 41:48.820
Why would we do that? I'll tell you why.
Because the songs kick F-ing ass.

41:48.993 --> 41:52.362
Wow! All these years,
wearing a suit to the office.

41:52.538 --> 41:56.202
- I should have been a naked drummer!
- Absolutely. Here's the dealio.

41:56.374 --> 42:00.503
If A.D.D. has more tunes like that,
then Matchbook is very interested.

42:00.671 --> 42:04.122
I'm sure you guys got a lot of heat.
Lot of people coming after you.

42:04.299 --> 42:06.090
Yeah, I didn't pay taxes in the '90s.

42:06.259 --> 42:09.674
The phone's been ringing
off the hook with offers.

42:09.845 --> 42:12.681
Good. Good to know. Okay.
We're in the pressure cooker.

42:12.849 --> 42:14.806
We are through
the looking glass, amigos.

42:14.976 --> 42:18.141
I'm gonna call my people, I'm gonna
come back and holler at you.

42:18.311 --> 42:19.343
Excuse me a sec.

42:21.106 --> 42:23.264
We're gonna be signed.
We're gonna be signed.

42:23.441 --> 42:27.487
- Well...
- I'm gonna go call Amelia and Curtis.

42:40.791 --> 42:44.740
I love your new tat.
- I just got it done.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.711
I'll validate you on your way out.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.161
All right, thanks.

42:49.342 --> 42:52.341
Hello. I'm here for A.D.D.

42:52.593 --> 42:53.673
Name?

42:53.845 --> 42:55.589
Robert Fishman.

42:57.015 --> 42:58.130
Studio 3.

42:58.850 --> 43:01.851
Wait. My name is on the list?

43:02.020 --> 43:06.063
- Yeah.
- So my name is on that list.

43:06.774 --> 43:07.972
Yeah.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.313
Can I have it?

43:10.069 --> 43:13.235
- No.
- Okay. Sure.

43:15.532 --> 43:18.617
This does not suck.
- You're the man.

43:19.244 --> 43:21.402
They have free food.

43:22.914 --> 43:24.539
Whoa.

43:25.708 --> 43:27.617
The mixing board...

43:27.793 --> 43:31.626
...with its thousands
of mysterious buttons.

43:32.382 --> 43:34.421
The big chair...

43:34.967 --> 43:37.837
...that swooshes me
around the studio.

43:38.554 --> 43:42.931
That allows me to slide
wherever I care to go.

43:43.100 --> 43:47.180
The soundproof glass window.
The giant headphones.

44:27.516 --> 44:30.186
It's not very good.
It's very, very depressing.

44:30.353 --> 44:32.392
It makes me wanna kill myself.

44:32.563 --> 44:35.267
Seriously, we need to stop this
right now.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.517
Why don't we turn this frown
upside down?

44:37.693 --> 44:41.358
Let's just push the tempo.
Say, "I'm not bitter."

44:41.530 --> 44:43.653
- Okay.
- Okay? Follow my lead.

44:43.824 --> 44:46.492
- What's he doing?
- From the bridge. Let's do it.

44:47.034 --> 44:48.861
One, two, three, four!

44:49.620 --> 44:52.621
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

44:53.249 --> 44:54.280
Sing!

44:56.586 --> 44:57.616
- You recording?
- Yep.

45:13.310 --> 45:15.516
- Yeah!
- Ow!

45:15.728 --> 45:18.480
- Yes. That's what I'm talking about!
- That rocks.

45:18.648 --> 45:22.811
Instead of a canoe paddling in a pond,
we were a tank flying down a mountain.

45:22.985 --> 45:25.903
- I like that. It feels really good.
- What do you guys think?

45:27.824 --> 45:31.441
Lennon's rolling over in his grave
to hide the boner you just gave him.

45:31.618 --> 45:33.029
We're gonna bounce that down.

45:33.203 --> 45:36.453
- Yeah! Bouncing it down!
- Whoo! What does that mean?

45:36.623 --> 45:38.865
I have no idea. Let's take five.

45:46.716 --> 45:49.835
Someday one of these bad boys
will have your name on it, C-note.

45:50.010 --> 45:51.968
I guarantee.

45:52.179 --> 45:55.180
There's a lot of biz buzz on you
back in Hollyweird, my man.

45:55.349 --> 45:56.380
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:56.559 --> 45:59.512
You got an opportunity to capitalize
on this YouTube thing.

45:59.686 --> 46:02.641
We're talking an album, a tour...

46:02.815 --> 46:06.348
You're gonna have more ladies
than Jay-Z got Mercedes.

46:07.026 --> 46:08.651
You're gonna need two dicks.

46:08.820 --> 46:10.777
- Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah. No problem.

46:10.946 --> 46:15.111
- What are you guys doing?
- Just telling Big C here the game plan.

46:15.285 --> 46:18.699
We're gonna hang out in the studio
a couple weeks, do more recording...

46:18.870 --> 46:21.575
...then strap in, young'uns.

46:22.207 --> 46:23.406
We're hitting the road.

46:23.584 --> 46:25.576
- What?
- You heard me, Curly Sue.

46:25.752 --> 46:27.081
Midwest tour.

46:27.379 --> 46:29.252
Huh? That's right!

46:29.422 --> 46:30.751
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

46:30.924 --> 46:32.501
All right. Easy.
- Yeah.

46:32.842 --> 46:35.001
And in conclusion,
ladies and gentlemen...

46:35.178 --> 46:39.803
...I promise you that on the road,
these kids will have an experience...

46:39.973 --> 46:44.137
...unlike any they have
ever experienced!

46:46.189 --> 46:47.766
Um...

46:47.940 --> 46:51.522
I think, well,
what he's trying to say in a...

46:51.693 --> 46:55.856
Just a really incomprehensible way...

46:56.531 --> 47:00.778
...is that this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for them.

47:00.952 --> 47:03.787
And they have worked so hard,
and want this so badly.

47:03.954 --> 47:08.663
And I'm not thrilled with letting Curtis go
without me being there...

47:08.834 --> 47:12.619
...but I don't want him to spend the rest
of his life thinking, "What if...?"

47:13.089 --> 47:16.504
You know? So you got my vote.

47:21.013 --> 47:22.175
I'm sorry.

47:22.347 --> 47:26.558
I lived my life saying, "What if...?"

47:26.726 --> 47:29.052
Twenty years of "What if...?"

47:29.478 --> 47:30.973
You feel me, Jack?

47:31.773 --> 47:34.062
You'll be safe, right?

47:34.234 --> 47:36.025
Of course.

47:37.110 --> 47:38.439
- Okay.
- Okay.

47:38.612 --> 47:39.775
- Okay?
- Okay.

47:39.947 --> 47:41.406
- Okay.
- Lisa?

47:45.119 --> 47:46.696
Okay. All right.

47:47.829 --> 47:49.952
Just please be careful.
- Okay.

47:54.544 --> 47:57.249
Hey. Thank you.

47:57.797 --> 47:59.836
You're welcome.

48:00.007 --> 48:04.835
But if one hair on his head is harmed,
I will kill you.

48:06.221 --> 48:08.179
- Cool.
- All right.

48:08.349 --> 48:11.136
- Mattie? I trust you.
- Yeah?

48:11.310 --> 48:13.302
But I don't trust your uncle.

48:13.478 --> 48:16.930
So I don't want you to listen
to a word he says, okay?

48:17.107 --> 48:19.514
- Okay.
- Okay.

48:28.075 --> 48:29.107
Whoa.

48:31.663 --> 48:33.950
First tour bus.

48:38.210 --> 48:39.491
Nice ride.

48:39.670 --> 48:41.461
I'll call you guys.
- Please do.

48:41.630 --> 48:44.121
- Will you be okay?
- Yes. I'm gonna be fine.

48:44.300 --> 48:47.086
- I love you. I'm so proud of you.
- Love you too.

48:55.351 --> 48:58.387
Mr. Gator here.
All you bear bait headed north...

48:58.562 --> 49:03.023
...on big slab l-5 round yardstick 40...
- Citizens band, huh?

49:03.525 --> 49:04.605
Pretty cool.

49:04.777 --> 49:07.694
- Ever heard of cell phones?
- Ever heard of brain cancer?

49:07.863 --> 49:12.109
There's two things in this world
I do not trust when they're wireless...

49:12.367 --> 49:15.986
...and that is phones and marionettes.

49:16.162 --> 49:18.997
Woo-hoo! Beaded curtains.

49:19.707 --> 49:22.079
Fridge with beer. Beer I didn't pay for.

49:22.251 --> 49:25.418
Yes. Time to party hearty. Hello.

49:25.588 --> 49:28.079
I thought you were
gonna be the responsible adult.

49:28.257 --> 49:30.250
Oh, I'm gonna be
responsible, all right...

49:30.425 --> 49:33.296
...for partying till my nuts catch fire.

49:33.470 --> 49:34.668
What is wrong with you?

49:34.846 --> 49:38.132
What is wrong with me? All my life,
people kept saying, " Grow up.

49:38.308 --> 49:42.934
Give up your dreams. Get a haircut, Fish.
You'll never rock anymore."

49:43.104 --> 49:46.804
Well, you know what?
Look at me now, day job!

49:46.983 --> 49:48.014
Woo-hoo!

49:48.192 --> 49:51.313
On your left,
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

49:56.867 --> 49:57.899
Whoo!

49:58.411 --> 50:00.818
Save some room
for my drums, baby...

50:00.996 --> 50:03.914
...because Fish's Age of Rage
has begu...

50:05.792 --> 50:07.451
I got a bug.

50:10.964 --> 50:15.756
- Woo-hoo! First venue.
- All right.

50:18.095 --> 50:19.506
First marquee.

50:19.847 --> 50:24.141
Check, check, check. Check, one, two.
Check, one, two. Check. Check.

50:24.310 --> 50:26.980
- First sound check.
- Yeah.

50:27.146 --> 50:28.936
Check, check. Test hit.

50:29.105 --> 50:32.309
Testes, one, two, testes,
check, check.

50:33.193 --> 50:37.606
Let's give a warm
Dayton welcome to A.D.

50:40.783 --> 50:42.740
Yeah.

50:43.452 --> 50:44.567
Hi.

50:48.083 --> 50:49.244
Hello.

50:49.959 --> 50:52.283
Hey, hey. Let's rock.

50:52.461 --> 50:54.537
One, two, three.

50:57.674 --> 50:59.584
First technical difficulty.

51:09.483 --> 51:10.513
First recovery.

51:53.606 --> 51:55.979
You nailed that key change
on "Too Far."

51:56.151 --> 51:57.694
Oh, thanks.

51:57.861 --> 52:01.229
You were out of your mind.
Chewing the keys off the board.

52:01.405 --> 52:04.609
You were better than Kurt Cobain.
You're like Hurt Cobain.

52:04.784 --> 52:05.899
A.D.D.

52:07.161 --> 52:08.905
You guys are sweet.

52:14.126 --> 52:16.451
First fan. Ha-ha!

52:16.628 --> 52:17.957
That did sound pretty good.

52:18.130 --> 52:21.829
It was better than good.
It was sweet.

52:22.800 --> 52:25.007
You're so wet.

52:25.178 --> 52:30.136
- Yes. Yes! Our band is sweet.
- No!

52:32.060 --> 52:34.017
- Sweet!
- Oh, my God.

52:34.186 --> 52:37.520
I'm not leaving you out, Mattie.
I'm saving the biggest hug for you...

52:37.690 --> 52:41.189
...because you brought me here.
- Uncle Rob, we don't need...

52:41.361 --> 52:42.641
- Oh, there we go. Shh.
- Oh, God.

52:42.820 --> 52:45.571
- Uncle Fish has got you there, big fella.
- So moist.

52:45.739 --> 52:46.853
Hi.

52:48.075 --> 52:52.986
Um, we were wondering if we could
buy you guys a beer or something.

52:55.957 --> 52:58.282
First groupies.

52:58.459 --> 53:01.959
Unfortunately, they are not of age.
Fortunately...

53:02.130 --> 53:04.799
...I am double the legal limit
for after-show parties.

53:04.965 --> 53:07.337
Yeah, we were kind of looking
for someone...

53:07.509 --> 53:14.307
...a little closer to our age,
but thanks.

53:15.476 --> 53:17.634
First blow-off. Let the games begin.

53:23.108 --> 53:26.558
Oh, man.
This is where rock 'n' roll came to die.

53:26.736 --> 53:30.151
It's all about text chats
and Playbox with you guys.

53:30.322 --> 53:32.399
- It's Xbox.
- Whatever.

53:32.574 --> 53:34.366
We're on tour.

53:34.535 --> 53:36.991
- You may never get this chance again.
- Come on.

53:37.163 --> 53:39.239
Okay? We have gotta cut loose.

53:39.415 --> 53:41.572
I feel like I cut loose
when I'm on-stage.

53:41.749 --> 53:44.704
Then I like to rest and unwind a little bit.
Please move.

53:44.878 --> 53:47.582
- And you call yourself my nephew.
- He's right.

53:47.755 --> 53:50.840
- It's late. We're tired.
- You're like a bunch of grandmas.

53:51.009 --> 53:52.800
You look like <i>Miss Saigon.</i>

53:53.469 --> 53:58.012
Wait, I get it. You guys don't know
what it means to go on tour.

53:58.182 --> 54:01.551
- Don't you do this.
- Well, I do.

54:01.727 --> 54:03.056
You're a monster.

54:15.322 --> 54:18.608
<i>Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish!</i>

54:41.723 --> 54:44.130
I am a golden Fish!

54:49.689 --> 54:52.559
Woo-hoo!

54:53.734 --> 54:55.774
Woo-hoo!

54:59.114 --> 55:00.987
Yeah! Now we got a party!

55:01.533 --> 55:04.024
- Aah!
- Oh!

55:22.178 --> 55:24.964
Hey, man. What's wrong?

55:25.139 --> 55:26.384
We're in the joint.

55:26.556 --> 55:29.427
We're going behind bars, man!
This is awesome.

55:29.601 --> 55:31.641
This is what being a rock star's
all about!

55:31.812 --> 55:35.345
Yeah, I don't know. I guess for me,
it's always been more about the music.

55:36.899 --> 55:40.849
No, music definitely
plays an important part.

55:41.362 --> 55:42.393
I just...

55:42.905 --> 55:44.732
I always hope maybe, you know...

55:44.908 --> 55:47.480
...someday, my dad
would hear one of my songs...

55:47.660 --> 55:51.740
...and feel, I don't know, something.

55:54.125 --> 55:55.322
You want my advice?

55:56.543 --> 55:58.950
You got a good thing going.

55:59.462 --> 56:01.621
Don't chase something
you're never gonna get.

56:01.798 --> 56:03.956
It's his loss. He's the one missing out.

56:04.133 --> 56:06.257
Trust me. I know.

56:06.428 --> 56:08.919
I got the best seat in the house.

56:09.139 --> 56:11.011
Right between the guitar
and the bass.

56:12.016 --> 56:15.800
- Fishman. You all made bail.
- Yes.

56:15.978 --> 56:19.145
- How?
- Thank you. The fans.

56:19.315 --> 56:21.888
The magic of rock 'n' roll.
Come on, where's my posse?

56:22.067 --> 56:26.230
That, my friends, is what happens
when you're a rock star.

56:26.404 --> 56:27.899
- Night, guys.
- Night, Fish.

56:28.073 --> 56:29.698
Oh, crap.

56:30.242 --> 56:31.404
Mom?

56:31.576 --> 56:34.826
I trusted you. I vouched for you
and for the safety of these kids.

56:34.996 --> 56:40.203
This is how you pay me back? By being
a drunken, irresponsible, drunken...

56:40.376 --> 56:41.751
- You said "drunken."
- I know.

56:42.295 --> 56:45.330
- What is wrong with you? Hey, Kim.
- Hey, Lisa.

56:45.505 --> 56:47.498
Two arrests in three weeks?

56:47.674 --> 56:50.878
What does it feel like
to destroy a hotel room?

56:51.053 --> 56:54.219
It must be freeing.
It's gotta be freeing, huh?

56:54.389 --> 56:56.262
You have no idea.

56:56.891 --> 56:58.849
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

56:59.019 --> 57:00.678
You are such an idiot.

57:00.853 --> 57:02.930
Come on, Matt. We're going.
Tour's over.

57:03.106 --> 57:05.265
You can't cancel the t...
Lower my voice.

57:05.442 --> 57:06.851
You can't cancel the tour.

57:07.025 --> 57:10.726
- He's right. People are digging...
- I don't care if you're selling out arenas.

57:10.905 --> 57:12.648
- I don't trust Drummer Boy...
- What?

57:12.823 --> 57:14.566
- Let's go.
- I'm not going home.

57:14.741 --> 57:17.742
I'm not, either. And don't call my uncle
Little Drummer Boy.

57:17.911 --> 57:21.659
- He's a big drummer boy.
- I'm the mother, you're the child.

57:21.831 --> 57:25.664
No, because I show you respect,
and then you don't listen.

57:25.836 --> 57:28.871
- I can't hear you.
- Hey. Guys. Guys.

57:29.047 --> 57:32.747
- You don't listen to me.
- We're a band and we stick together.

57:32.925 --> 57:34.123
We're finishing the tour.

57:34.302 --> 57:37.302
I'm sorry if you guys have a problem,
but that's the way it is.

57:38.180 --> 57:39.591
Yeah.

57:39.766 --> 57:44.058
- Okay, I'll go.
- What?

57:44.227 --> 57:47.063
I don't think it's fair.
These kids cancel their tour...

57:47.231 --> 57:51.891
...because Baby Huey over here
isn't responsible enough to be an adult...

57:52.068 --> 57:53.348
...so I will go.

57:53.528 --> 57:55.817
- I'll go too.
- Oh, be quiet, Stan.

57:55.989 --> 58:01.363
No. A tour with parents is not a tour.
On this point, I will not bend. That's it.

58:01.536 --> 58:04.286
My line in the sand has been drawn.

58:06.164 --> 58:08.490
I just wanna say
on behalf of the band...

58:08.667 --> 58:11.158
...it's kind of a buzz-kill
having you on the tour.

58:11.336 --> 58:16.128
Really? If you hadn't been such a jackass,
I wouldn't have to be here.

58:16.299 --> 58:19.216
Whatever. I just need you
to do a little babysitting...

58:19.385 --> 58:23.383
...and don't rain on my parade, okay?
Because I'm living my dream.

58:24.224 --> 58:27.841
Did you always have that knee brace
in your dream?

58:28.477 --> 58:30.517
What did I say about raining
on my parade?

58:30.688 --> 58:33.641
Sorry. You know what? I'm sorry.

58:33.816 --> 58:36.224
You are an adult. I mean, technically.

58:36.402 --> 58:40.695
You can do what you want. I just think
you might want to start to take it easy.

58:40.863 --> 58:43.569
Take it easy? Thanks, the Eagles.

58:43.742 --> 58:45.984
No. I spent my whole life
taking it easy...

58:46.494 --> 58:49.115
...and now I'm making up
for lost time.

58:49.288 --> 58:50.533
- Hoo-hoo!
- All right.

58:50.706 --> 58:53.079
I'm gonna do whatever I want.
Watch this.

58:53.250 --> 58:54.792
I may go moon a trucker.

58:54.960 --> 58:58.828
Or streak up and down the bus,
or take a nap.

58:59.007 --> 59:01.757
Not sure which. My choice.
Hmm. Make a decision.

59:01.925 --> 59:04.167
I think I'll take a nap. Excuse me.

59:04.511 --> 59:05.674
Okey-dokey.

59:08.515 --> 59:11.717
I have a silly question. Do you
have any hand sanitizer?

59:11.934 --> 59:14.935
I do. I've used it for
other things, but you're welcome to it.

59:15.104 --> 59:16.183
Jesus Christ.

59:20.402 --> 59:23.484
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's D.V. Put me on shout, yo.

59:25.489 --> 59:27.696
<i>- Hey, are you guys sitting down?</i>
- One second.

59:27.867 --> 59:30.155
<i>- Yeah, well stand up. I got great news.</i>
- Okay.

59:30.327 --> 59:32.450
You're gonna shoot a music video.

59:32.621 --> 59:34.779
Whoo! Yes!

59:34.956 --> 59:37.992
<i>I got us the hottest video director</i>
<i>in town.</i>

59:38.167 --> 59:41.868
Yeah. All right, I gotta go.
I'm in a tremendous amount of pain.

59:59.479 --> 01:00:00.973
Cut it, please. Cut...

01:00:01.147 --> 01:00:03.520
We're rehearsing now.
That means you should move.

01:00:03.692 --> 01:00:05.020
Your mouth and your body.

01:00:05.193 --> 01:00:08.479
Go backwards in slow motion,
then say the words backwards.

01:00:08.654 --> 01:00:09.935
Where's the girl?

01:00:10.114 --> 01:00:11.572
Say the words backwards.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.567
In post it's all gonna be forward.

01:00:13.742 --> 01:00:16.281
You have to go backwards
for me to make it forward, get it?

01:00:22.709 --> 01:00:25.165
- Where's the girl?
- Don't hold your breath.

01:00:25.337 --> 01:00:27.495
- What is happening?
- Excuse me, Kip?

01:00:27.672 --> 01:00:30.627
- Yes?
- Listen, can we call this a day?

01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:32.958
- No. No, this isn't happening.
- Listen to me.

01:00:33.135 --> 01:00:34.464
- What's going on?
- Go ahead.

01:00:34.637 --> 01:00:37.009
It's Amelia.
She's just having a really tough day.

01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:39.720
- Not feeling like a rock star.
- I'll go talk to her.

01:00:39.893 --> 01:00:41.766
Okay. Good luck with that.

01:00:44.897 --> 01:00:46.640
- Amelia?
- Just go away.

01:00:46.816 --> 01:00:48.642
Come on, it's okay to be nervous.

01:00:48.817 --> 01:00:51.308
I either throw up or get the runs
before every show.

01:00:51.487 --> 01:00:55.151
- Last night it was both.
- Gross. Leave me alone.

01:00:55.323 --> 01:00:59.866
Come on. Girlfriend, we need you.
Come on.

01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:04.866
- I'm sorry. I just can't.
- Hey, what's wrong?

01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:09.785
- I told that idiot stylist not to brush it.
- Let me see.

01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:14.923
Holy sh... Oh, wow. Hey.

01:01:15.093 --> 01:01:20.596
- See? I look like shit, okay? Go away.
- Listen, it's just hair. It's no biggie.

01:01:22.141 --> 01:01:25.176
Maybe girls like me
just don't belong in music videos.

01:01:26.645 --> 01:01:30.724
You know, if that's the look
that they want, they should just...

01:01:30.898 --> 01:01:33.816
...grab one of those annoying little girls
hanging on Curtis.

01:01:33.985 --> 01:01:35.396
Don't say that.

01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:39.817
Those girls are a dime a dozen.
That is why you are in this band...

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:43.858
...and they are not. Because you
have looks and personality.

01:01:44.036 --> 01:01:45.909
You've got attitude,
you've got edge...

01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:51.369
...you've got pure, unfiltered
badass-ed-ness. Yeah.

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:53.665
Now, as far as the 'do goes...

01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:56.672
...take it from someone that's been
at war with their hair.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:03.009
It just needs a little bit of love
and a lot of product.

01:02:12.522 --> 01:02:14.062
Welcome back.

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:21.311
Smile? No smile?

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:24.573
Thanks, Fish.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:35.161
- Good job.
- This part's gonna blow people's minds.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:39.331
I'm gonna shoot you with this old Bolex,
stop-motion, you're gonna be animated.

01:02:39.504 --> 01:02:43.668
So pick your spot, take your breath,
and move a tiny bit.

01:02:45.677 --> 01:02:46.709
Move a tiny bit.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.964
Move a tiny bit.

01:02:50.139 --> 01:02:52.926
Move a tiny bit. Wait a minute.

01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:55.342
- You have a tattoo.
- What? Where?

01:02:55.519 --> 01:02:57.678
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna get that checked out.

01:02:57.855 --> 01:02:59.847
Funny. Good. I'm just saying
it's weird...

01:03:00.023 --> 01:03:02.940
...because you have a tattoo,
but you're a mom.

01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:07.357
Gee, nothing gets by you, does it?
Yes, I have a tattoo, and I am a mom.

01:03:07.531 --> 01:03:09.239
A few too many flirtinis?

01:03:09.408 --> 01:03:11.898
Close. It was an old band.

01:03:12.076 --> 01:03:13.903
- You were in a band?
- Mm-hm.

01:03:14.078 --> 01:03:16.570
I was in an all-girl punk band.

01:03:16.747 --> 01:03:17.945
No way. That's awesome.

01:03:18.124 --> 01:03:22.620
Yeah. Put a safety pin in my T-shirt
and I'm a badass. Good times.

01:03:22.795 --> 01:03:27.872
So what happened to the old "S.W."
band? Why'd you give it up?

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.794
Well, I'm not exactly sure...

01:03:29.969 --> 01:03:32.804
...but I think it had something to do
with the fact that...

01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:35.260
...a pregnant 17-year-old lead singer...

01:03:35.432 --> 01:03:38.005
...wasn't exactly what MTV
was looking for.

01:03:38.643 --> 01:03:41.893
- They so lack vision.
- Cut! You moved too much. Okay?

01:03:42.063 --> 01:03:45.976
"Tiny bit" means tiny bit, not big bit
or regular bit. Tiny bit. Move a tiny bit.

01:03:46.149 --> 01:03:48.985
I don't know why you're blinking
more than a normal person...

01:03:49.153 --> 01:03:51.941
...but blink like a normal person
or don't blink.

01:03:52.115 --> 01:03:53.145
So your choice.

01:04:04.251 --> 01:04:05.911
Matt.

01:04:08.462 --> 01:04:10.870
- Matt.
- Yeah, you okay?

01:04:11.049 --> 01:04:14.880
- Do you sleep with your eyes open?
- No, I'm fine.

01:04:15.052 --> 01:04:16.712
Good night.

01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:59.503
Hey, can you sign my shirt?

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.592
You're... You're very
well-proportioned.

01:05:08.185 --> 01:05:10.511
- Hey. Good night.
- Good night.

01:05:23.534 --> 01:05:27.448
<i>You Tube sensation A.D.D.</i>
<i>have gone from total unknowns...</i>

01:05:27.621 --> 01:05:29.827
<i>... to a top- 10 album,</i>
<i>a number one single...</i>

01:05:29.998 --> 01:05:33.413
<i>... and a sold-out tour</i>
<i>in just three short months.</i>

01:05:35.336 --> 01:05:37.578
Thank you very much.
You have a great night.

01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:41.376
I love you, Matt.

01:05:43.135 --> 01:05:46.053
Somebody threw this at me,
and it's got a telephone number...

01:05:46.222 --> 01:05:48.712
...an e-mail address, and it's big.

01:05:48.891 --> 01:05:50.515
Rock 'n' roll.

01:05:51.559 --> 01:05:56.980
- Let me see that.
- Hey, hey. A.D.D., you were amazing.

01:05:57.148 --> 01:06:00.647
Oh, wow.
Mattie, oh, it was so incredible.

01:06:00.818 --> 01:06:03.819
Everybody loved it and they were
singing along with the words.

01:06:03.988 --> 01:06:07.736
They were mouthing your words.
You were good, Fish.

01:06:07.908 --> 01:06:12.321
Oh, my goodness. That was great, guys.
Unh! Give it up.

01:06:12.496 --> 01:06:15.662
Okay, I understand. Nice. Nicely done.
Here's the plan, okay?

01:06:15.832 --> 01:06:20.162
We gotta go down, give some face time
to the fans, then get out of here, okay?

01:06:20.337 --> 01:06:24.037
MySpace is throwing you guys a party,
and I don't wanna be late.

01:06:24.299 --> 01:06:28.083
Wanna get there before all the good
T-A-l-L is taken, know what I'm saying?

01:06:28.261 --> 01:06:29.635
We can spell.

01:06:29.803 --> 01:06:32.377
Yeah. Yeah, no, I get that.
That makes sense.

01:06:32.557 --> 01:06:35.760
Hello. Hello there. Hi.
I don't think we've been introduced.

01:06:35.935 --> 01:06:39.220
- David Marshall, Matchbook Records.
- Hey. Kim Powell. I'm Curtis' mom.

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:41.021
Oh!

01:06:41.607 --> 01:06:43.813
The wellspring, huh?

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:45.609
Excuse me?

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:48.772
I would love to spend nine months
inside you.

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:54.067
Why's everybody being quiet?

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.284
Ha-ha-ha!
- Hoo-hoo!

01:06:56.454 --> 01:06:59.739
There it is. It's like a school bus
for assholes.

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:02.833
- I'm not gonna get in that thing.
- That is a nice ride.

01:07:03.002 --> 01:07:06.750
- Yeah. Go have fun.
- Come on, let's go.

01:07:06.964 --> 01:07:09.538
- Oh, wow. Yellow.
- Yeah. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

01:07:10.759 --> 01:07:12.133
Okay, let's go.

01:07:12.301 --> 01:07:15.386
I'm gonna cut to the chase,
because that's how I do, but...

01:07:15.555 --> 01:07:18.129
You're familiar
with the term "MILF"?

01:07:18.642 --> 01:07:21.559
Because I would never use that
to describe you, ever.

01:07:21.728 --> 01:07:23.850
I hate that term. It disgusts me.

01:07:24.021 --> 01:07:28.683
No, no, no. you are more
of a "MILMSLT."

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.109
That's a mother I'd like to
make sweet love to.

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:37.482
Oh, thank you.
I'm really flattered, actually.

01:07:38.285 --> 01:07:42.116
Um, so are you familiar
with the term "PILS"?

01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:45.372
No, no, no. What's a PILS?

01:07:45.541 --> 01:07:47.866
It's a person I'd like to stab.

01:07:52.924 --> 01:07:55.545
- I know.
- Oh, that's good. Watch out here.

01:07:55.718 --> 01:07:57.710
Cougar's got claws.

01:07:57.886 --> 01:07:59.926
- I'm gonna hop in the Hummer.
- Good idea.

01:08:00.097 --> 01:08:01.888
- I'll see you guys in the Hummer.
- Go.

01:08:02.057 --> 01:08:03.516
Hit the omelet bar.

01:08:03.683 --> 01:08:06.009
- Well played, my lady.
- Shall we?

01:08:06.186 --> 01:08:08.475
You know, I'm gonna take a rain check.

01:08:08.647 --> 01:08:11.137
Really? You? A rain check, huh?

01:08:11.315 --> 01:08:13.641
- Okay.
- Well, you know, I got...

01:08:13.902 --> 01:08:17.401
...a date back at the club
with a couple of shorties, so...

01:08:17.572 --> 01:08:21.520
- Oh, all right. See you later.
- Okay. All right.

01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:24.572
Don't wait up for me, okay,
because I'm gonna be:

01:08:24.745 --> 01:08:27.580
- Whoop, whoop! Whoop.
- See you.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.562
Mattie?
- Hi.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:57.680
- Hi. Are you okay?
- Oh, super duper. I am just doing...

01:08:57.859 --> 01:08:59.234
- This is some...
- Who is she?

01:08:59.778 --> 01:09:02.269
I don't know her name.
I've seen her at our shows...

01:09:02.447 --> 01:09:06.313
...and I've wanted to engage her,
but I just get so nervous.

01:09:06.492 --> 01:09:09.694
- Which one is she?
- She's sitting at the bar, in the blue.

01:09:09.871 --> 01:09:11.947
- No. Don't stare.
- I'm not staring.

01:09:12.122 --> 01:09:15.124
You're embarrassing me in front of her.
Just be respectful.

01:09:15.376 --> 01:09:17.701
She's the one sitting over there
in the blue T-shirt.

01:09:18.252 --> 01:09:23.758
Uh, okay. The shirt that reads
"I heart Matt" in rhinestones?

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.254
That could be a coincidence.

01:09:25.426 --> 01:09:28.380
Maybe it's "I heart Matt" LeBlanc
from TV's the <i>Friends.</i>

01:09:28.554 --> 01:09:31.805
Look at me, Amelia.

01:09:31.975 --> 01:09:36.103
Look at me. I am not the world's
most handsome guy here.

01:09:36.895 --> 01:09:38.225
And...

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:42.057
...I don't know how to speak to a girl,
other than you.

01:09:42.234 --> 01:09:44.108
I've never kissed a girl.

01:09:44.278 --> 01:09:48.774
I've never asked one to go to a movie
or maybe go to dinner, or...

01:09:53.411 --> 01:09:56.080
There, okay?
Now you've had the experience.

01:09:56.247 --> 01:09:58.573
Now go talk to her
and quit pussing out.

01:10:09.968 --> 01:10:12.721
Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:10:27.109 --> 01:10:29.815
- Could you sign this, please?
- Oh, yeah.

01:10:29.988 --> 01:10:32.229
Yeah, that would be great.

01:10:44.418 --> 01:10:45.912
Huh.

01:10:50.966 --> 01:10:51.997
Hello?

01:10:55.637 --> 01:10:57.630
- Hey. Can I?
- Sure, come on in.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:02.088
You're back already, huh?
How were the smallies?

01:11:02.643 --> 01:11:06.511
Shorties, and I decided to call it
an early night tonight.

01:11:06.689 --> 01:11:09.559
Those were some great moves,
by the way.

01:11:10.275 --> 01:11:11.306
Yeah, great.

01:11:12.819 --> 01:11:15.855
So this is supposed to be a guitar.

01:11:16.114 --> 01:11:19.318
Yeah, it's a guitar. It's really fun.
Do you wanna play?

01:11:19.493 --> 01:11:21.816
- Come on. Come on.
- All right.

01:11:21.994 --> 01:11:24.532
- All right, just put it on. Okay.
- Okay.

01:11:25.039 --> 01:11:27.246
See? It goes red, blue.
- I'm lost.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:28.661
- Blue.
- Blue.

01:11:28.834 --> 01:11:33.295
- And hit this so you can get extra points.
- I love this song. This song is awesome.

01:11:33.463 --> 01:11:34.662
You're doing it.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.627
- I'm kicking your ass is what I'm doing.
- You're not even.

01:11:37.801 --> 01:11:41.585
- Yeah.
- Now we're a rock band.

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.341
Double head.

01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:51.010
May I introduce
A.D.D.'s first video. Pow!

01:12:14.419 --> 01:12:17.788
You know, verse, chorus, verse, chorus.
You've heard the song.

01:12:17.965 --> 01:12:19.623
So, what do you think, huh?

01:12:19.798 --> 01:12:23.547
I'm not even embarrassed by it,
and I'm embarrassed by, like, everything.

01:12:23.719 --> 01:12:25.214
Well, your body's changing.

01:12:25.387 --> 01:12:28.804
Don't you hate how the camera itself
adds 10 pounds?

01:12:28.975 --> 01:12:33.137
Yeah. The camera and food, right?
If you like that, you're gonna love this.

01:12:33.311 --> 01:12:34.390
This little puppy...

01:12:34.562 --> 01:12:38.561
...is going to debut next Monday
as the number nine video in the country.

01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:41.563
Yeah. All right.

01:12:41.735 --> 01:12:44.571
And you're gonna crap
your khakis when you hear this.

01:12:44.739 --> 01:12:47.656
Y'all just got asked to open
for Vesuvius...

01:12:47.825 --> 01:12:51.241
...in honor of their induction into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Huh?

01:12:51.746 --> 01:12:53.453
That's pretty great, right?

01:12:53.622 --> 01:12:57.287
Like a " Cleveland up-and-comers
open for Cleveland legends" thizz-ang.

01:12:57.459 --> 01:13:01.503
Not to mention, it keeps it all in the
Matchbook family, which is good.

01:13:01.671 --> 01:13:03.296
No. No.

01:13:03.465 --> 01:13:04.627
No, no, no.

01:13:05.133 --> 01:13:08.881
Fish, Fish? Breathe, breathe.
You have to breathe.

01:13:09.053 --> 01:13:10.927
All right. Okay.

01:13:11.764 --> 01:13:13.923
What if I said yes already?
Where does that leave us?

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:16.386
Oh, God. Okay, all right, Fish?

01:13:19.271 --> 01:13:23.103
- Drama.
- No!

01:13:23.609 --> 01:13:27.273
- I'll go talk to him.
- No, no. Just sit. I'll do it.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:29.521
You guys realize
if you open for Vesuvius...

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:33.067
...you'll get to play
in front of 20,000 people.

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:36.235
Fish has a history with them.
We can't do that.

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:41.288
Look, I love Fish. I do. I love that guy.
And I never say love...

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:44.543
...but the guy's practically
in a full-body cast.

01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:48.295
You know what I mean? I think it's time
we put him out of his misery.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.301
Know what I'm saying?
We need to freshen the look of the band.

01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:55.344
- What do you say?
- A band's a family.

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:57.388
You don't turn your back on family.

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.724
What is this, <i>Full House?</i>
Are you kidding?

01:14:02.895 --> 01:14:05.931
He stays. That's that.

01:14:06.982 --> 01:14:10.518
You know what? You're right.
Yeah. No, he stays. Good call.

01:14:11.988 --> 01:14:16.863
- Hey. Fish!
- No, no! I can't do it. I won't do it.

01:14:17.034 --> 01:14:19.524
"Promised Land" is my song.
I came up with the title.

01:14:19.703 --> 01:14:21.530
And they are in the promised land...

01:14:21.705 --> 01:14:24.908
...and I'm walking around in the desert
for 40 years. I'm Moses.

01:14:25.083 --> 01:14:28.416
I led them to the land of milk
and honey and three-ways and orgies...

01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:31.412
- Fish. Listen to me.
- And I'm eating manna...

01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:36.125
I can't... I can't hear you...

01:14:37.386 --> 01:14:38.584
Ooh.

01:14:39.513 --> 01:14:41.055
Hello, Yoko.

01:14:48.146 --> 01:14:50.269
- What was that for?
- To shut you up.

01:14:50.899 --> 01:14:52.524
- Okay.
- Now listen to me.

01:14:52.692 --> 01:14:55.265
You have already made it
to the promised land, okay?

01:14:55.445 --> 01:14:57.769
Not the way you thought,
but you've made it.

01:14:57.947 --> 01:15:01.447
Are you gonna blow this
because of some stupid grudge?

01:15:01.701 --> 01:15:06.197
Come on. Just let it go.
Play the gig. Please.

01:15:09.248 --> 01:15:11.740
Your witchy, witchy ways
won't work on me.

01:15:13.045 --> 01:15:17.956
I am never opening for Vesuvius.

01:15:29.561 --> 01:15:34.601
Oh, oh, oh. Hey, buddy. Hey, man.
What a coincidence, huh?

01:15:34.773 --> 01:15:37.809
- I didn't know you were staying here.
- Yeah, I love this place.

01:15:37.984 --> 01:15:39.776
Same floor and everything.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.196
I wanna say
I think it's super awesome...

01:15:45.366 --> 01:15:47.406
...that you're cool with Fish
banging your mom.

01:15:47.577 --> 01:15:50.068
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just saying...

01:15:50.247 --> 01:15:53.746
...it's mature that you approve of him
hitting that sweet stuff.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:56.585
Cool as a fan, man.
You're a cool, cool kid.

01:15:56.752 --> 01:16:01.165
You're like Vin Diesel
wrapped in a Jeremy Piven pie.

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:05.043
All right. Here we are.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.922
You know what? I just realized
I'm not in this hotel.

01:16:11.558 --> 01:16:14.642
Take care, kiddo.
You're a rock star. Whoo!

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.260
If you guys have been dying to spend
some time in Cleveland...

01:16:52.429 --> 01:16:56.640
...come out next month when A.D.D.'s
gonna be doing a free arena show.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.141
We're gonna be opening up for
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees...

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.312
...the mighty Vesuvius.

01:17:12.156 --> 01:17:14.943
Hey, hey. I thought you said
we weren't gonna do that.

01:17:15.117 --> 01:17:18.034
- I decided we were.
- Guys, we should discuss this later.

01:17:18.203 --> 01:17:19.863
There's no need. It's a done deal.

01:17:20.039 --> 01:17:23.289
I am not doing that, okay?
I am not opening for them.

01:17:24.877 --> 01:17:26.667
You think we should open
for Vesuvius?

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:30.374
Then you better find a new drummer.

01:17:31.049 --> 01:17:33.125
Know why you're in this band?
You're a joke.

01:17:33.301 --> 01:17:35.424
I'm not letting
my mom go out with a joke.

01:17:35.595 --> 01:17:38.596
And I'm not missing the show of my life
because of you.

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:46.689
Ow! Ow!

01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:59.575
What? You've never seen anyone
kick over their drums in anger...

01:17:59.744 --> 01:18:01.818
...jump off the stage
and twist both ankles?

01:18:01.994 --> 01:18:06.538
No.
- Well, now you have. Ow.

01:18:06.917 --> 01:18:08.244
Make a path.

01:18:15.841 --> 01:18:17.715
Oh, no.

01:18:24.682 --> 01:18:27.719
Fish. It's okay. Are you okay?

01:18:28.395 --> 01:18:29.509
Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:30.021 --> 01:18:31.930
- You all right?
- Yeah, top of the world.

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:34.727
Thanks. My left ankle is making
a pretty serious clicking noise.

01:18:36.109 --> 01:18:38.398
- Yeah, I hear that.
- Yeah.

01:18:38.571 --> 01:18:41.109
Listen. We need to talk to Curtis.

01:18:41.282 --> 01:18:44.485
Fish, we kissed. Once. On tour.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:49.701
You know what this is. This isn't real.
In real life, I am Curtis's mom...

01:18:49.873 --> 01:18:54.167
...and you are... Oh, you are just a guy
who won't grow up.

01:18:54.336 --> 01:18:58.167
I tried growing up, okay?
For 20 years.

01:18:58.339 --> 01:19:02.551
I tried it. I hated every moment of it,
and I'm not going back to that.

01:19:02.719 --> 01:19:06.930
You never even moved forward.
You didn't give being an adult a chance.

01:19:07.098 --> 01:19:10.431
You're just living in some moment
that happened 20 years ago.

01:19:11.643 --> 01:19:14.051
You said you didn't have it
figured it out either.

01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:17.646
I don't, but at least
I'm living in the present.

01:19:34.247 --> 01:19:36.287
Hello, rat.

01:19:43.798 --> 01:19:47.416
Here we are. Check it out, guys, huh?
Not bad.

01:19:47.593 --> 01:19:50.049
Yeah, yeah.
- Uh-oh.

01:19:50.221 --> 01:19:53.223
Who could that be?
Guys, this is your new drummer, Paul.

01:19:53.392 --> 01:19:56.759
Go ahead and get to know him better.
Give him a nickname. Any animal.

01:19:56.936 --> 01:19:59.972
Except Fish. Obviously,
that would be a little awkward.

01:20:00.148 --> 01:20:02.769
Cool. Great. Well, come on.
Let's go. Let's rehearse.

01:20:03.776 --> 01:20:04.807
Set up. Come on.

01:20:05.027 --> 01:20:07.732
Yeah, there we go. All right.

01:20:28.174 --> 01:20:29.964
Any last requests?

01:20:30.133 --> 01:20:31.711
Be gentle.

01:20:42.479 --> 01:20:43.807
Robert, I like your résumé.

01:20:43.979 --> 01:20:49.105
I certainly love your objectives,
and Stan speaks very highly of you.

01:20:49.986 --> 01:20:53.650
I do notice that your last job
was a few months ago.

01:20:54.949 --> 01:20:56.609
What have you been doing since then?

01:20:59.328 --> 01:21:05.946
He's been taking some time
to recharge the old batteries.

01:21:06.125 --> 01:21:08.747
And now I'm ready to work here
until I die.

01:21:16.093 --> 01:21:21.051
I don't even wanna talk to him about it.
It's so frustrating and it's so unfair.

01:21:21.223 --> 01:21:22.718
Hey.

01:21:23.559 --> 01:21:26.643
Hey. We were supposed to start
two hours ago.

01:21:26.811 --> 01:21:29.563
Relax. I figured you guys
could just practice with Paul.

01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:32.270
Ever since you forced Fish out...

01:21:32.443 --> 01:21:34.066
...this went from being a band...

01:21:34.235 --> 01:21:36.312
...to being you
and some people behind you.

01:21:36.488 --> 01:21:39.192
I didn't force him out of the band.
He quit.

01:21:39.365 --> 01:21:43.612
You were mean and manipulative,
and you completely forced him out.

01:21:45.538 --> 01:21:48.158
- This Paul thing is good for us.
- Are you kidding me?

01:21:48.331 --> 01:21:51.867
Look at him. It's like
Abercrombie's making people now.

01:21:52.044 --> 01:21:53.207
We need Fish.

01:21:54.130 --> 01:21:57.830
You know? He's sloppy and stupid,
and he's full of life.

01:21:58.050 --> 01:22:00.172
We're not the same without him.
You know it.

01:22:00.343 --> 01:22:03.297
Okay, yeah. He said
he won't open for Vesuvius.

01:22:03.471 --> 01:22:07.635
Curtis, had you gone up to him
and just said it from your heart...

01:22:07.809 --> 01:22:12.102
...how important it was for you
and the band, he would have done it.

01:22:12.271 --> 01:22:15.806
- Mattie's right. I mean, he would have.
- He would've done it in a second.

01:22:15.983 --> 01:22:18.984
Because he loves you.

01:22:21.447 --> 01:22:24.197
Know what, guys? I'm really not
in the mood to practice.

01:22:28.078 --> 01:22:31.660
I hope you know that I'm getting paid
whether we practice or not.

01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:33.914
Shut up, Paul.

01:23:14.204 --> 01:23:15.912
Hey.

01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:17.915
Hey.

01:23:18.918 --> 01:23:21.953
Listen, I had no idea
real life was so boring.

01:23:23.588 --> 01:23:26.542
And soul crushing.
Don't forget soul crushing.

01:23:26.717 --> 01:23:28.507
That's a nice suit.

01:23:29.427 --> 01:23:31.384
I'm gonna kill you.

01:23:31.929 --> 01:23:34.136
You mind if I sit?

01:23:35.766 --> 01:23:37.308
So...

01:23:37.476 --> 01:23:41.521
...Matt says that if I'd asked you
in a nicer way to open for Vesuvius...

01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:43.515
...you'd have said yes.

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:46.442
Well, even though he's a genius,
he's an idiot.

01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:49.066
I am not opening for no Vesuvius.

01:23:49.237 --> 01:23:53.187
- You're being a baby.
- No, I'm not. I'm being realistic.

01:23:53.367 --> 01:23:55.655
You're telling me Robert Fishman,
a.k.a. Fish...

01:23:55.827 --> 01:24:00.572
...has a chance to play Q Arena
in front of 20,000 screaming fans...

01:24:00.748 --> 01:24:02.907
...and he's not gonna take it?

01:24:03.293 --> 01:24:06.245
I saw Ozzy bite the head off a bat
on that stage.

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:09.872
You could see A.D.D. there with
a really good seat between the guitar...

01:24:10.049 --> 01:24:12.586
...and bass.
- And the bass. Best seat in the house.

01:24:14.636 --> 01:24:16.675
No. No way.

01:24:16.846 --> 01:24:20.796
I am not opening for Vesuvius.
They can open for me.

01:24:21.684 --> 01:24:22.930
It's not fair.

01:24:23.103 --> 01:24:25.059
Of course not. Who said life was fair?

01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:27.980
- Don't be so mature.
- You want my advice?

01:24:28.148 --> 01:24:30.307
You got a good thing going.

01:24:31.444 --> 01:24:34.444
You shouldn't be chasing something
you're never gonna get back.

01:24:34.613 --> 01:24:37.187
Keep stealing my lines,
I'll punch you in the eye.

01:24:38.993 --> 01:24:41.909
Let me tell you how it's gonna be.
You're gonna suck it up...

01:24:42.078 --> 01:24:45.329
...because A.D.D. needs a sloppy-ass
Robert Fishman-type drummer.

01:24:45.499 --> 01:24:50.658
It's just one more night, one more show.
Just finish what you started.

01:24:53.256 --> 01:24:54.833
What do you say?

01:24:58.177 --> 01:24:59.422
I say...

01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:04.964
...I am the best sloppy-ass
Robert Fishman-type drummer there is.

01:25:06.185 --> 01:25:08.307
- Ow.
- Ooh, I'm sorry.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:11.977
Excuse me, everyone?
May I have your attention?

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:14.390
I want you all to know
that me and my band...

01:25:14.567 --> 01:25:17.521
...are gonna play the Q Arena.

01:25:17.695 --> 01:25:19.984
And I want you to know
it is never too late.

01:25:20.156 --> 01:25:21.982
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

01:25:22.158 --> 01:25:23.782
Yeah. All right.

01:25:23.951 --> 01:25:25.860
It is never too late to rock.

01:25:26.036 --> 01:25:28.658
Come on, guys. Let's go. Stage dive.
Stage dive.

01:25:28.831 --> 01:25:30.455
Stage dive.

01:25:30.624 --> 01:25:33.542
We're gonna bodysurf you
on out of here. Come on. Let's go.

01:25:34.253 --> 01:25:37.667
All right. Here we go.
Rock 'n' roll!

01:25:39.716 --> 01:25:42.919
Ow, ow, ow. My carpal tunnel.
Okay, put me down.

01:25:49.141 --> 01:25:50.173
Yes.

01:25:51.268 --> 01:25:54.602
All right. Can you feel the excitement?

01:25:54.772 --> 01:25:57.772
I sat right there for Metallica...

01:25:57.941 --> 01:26:01.191
...way up there for Mötley Crüe,
behind the stage for Van Halen...

01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:04.315
...but I never thought
I would be standing here.

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:06.232
I'm so nervous.
I'm gonna be sick.

01:26:06.408 --> 01:26:08.068
Act like we're back in the garage.

01:26:08.243 --> 01:26:12.322
Yeah, with 20,000 Vesuvius fans
just chilling on the driveway.

01:26:12.496 --> 01:26:15.581
- You think they'll like us?
- We're gonna make them like us.

01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:20.079
There they are. Woo-hoo!
A.D.D. Ha-ha!

01:26:20.254 --> 01:26:25.331
Fish, dude, so glad to have you
back, bro. For real, for real.

01:26:25.509 --> 01:26:29.257
Everybody at Matchbook is happy
you worked out your thing.

01:26:30.013 --> 01:26:32.006
Well? You ready?

01:26:32.266 --> 01:26:34.387
Let's get ready to do this show.
Come on.

01:26:34.558 --> 01:26:38.177
All right. Come on, let's go.

01:26:58.832 --> 01:27:00.456
Okay, guys, follow me.

01:27:00.625 --> 01:27:04.457
I got A.D.D. right here with me.
This way.

01:27:06.798 --> 01:27:11.673
Clear the hall. Vesuvius coming
through. Vesuvius coming through.

01:27:41.496 --> 01:27:43.121
Ha-ha! Uh-oh!

01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:46.374
A.D.D., let me introduce you
to the mighty Vesuvius.

01:27:47.419 --> 01:27:49.459
David Marshall.
We've met a couple times.

01:27:49.630 --> 01:27:50.661
No.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.167
Sorry.

01:27:53.174 --> 01:27:57.468
Hello, kiddies. You're the band
we're supposed to launch.

01:27:58.138 --> 01:27:59.797
Gobsmacked, eh?

01:27:59.972 --> 01:28:04.717
It's all right, mates. It's difficult
to meet your heroes for the first time.

01:28:06.394 --> 01:28:08.802
Why do you guys
have British accents?

01:28:08.981 --> 01:28:12.148
Who's this geezer?
"Why do you have British accents?"

01:28:12.318 --> 01:28:14.643
Hang on. Hang on. We know him, mates.

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:18.319
Back from when
we were American. Look, it's Fish.

01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:19.605
Who?

01:28:19.783 --> 01:28:24.361
Oh, Trash, Trash, it's Fish. Fishy.
Fish and chips.

01:28:24.538 --> 01:28:25.866
Oh, right.

01:28:26.123 --> 01:28:28.695
Yeah, Fish, having a laugh.

01:28:28.874 --> 01:28:32.457
All right, mate? Sticks, this is the bloke
what you replaced.

01:28:32.628 --> 01:28:34.916
- Hey, that's right.
- Fishy.

01:28:35.130 --> 01:28:38.334
I just wanted to point out
that I'm actually from England.

01:28:39.217 --> 01:28:43.131
He's just taking the piss.
You know, one of me mates.

01:28:43.304 --> 01:28:45.096
So, Fish.

01:28:46.391 --> 01:28:47.506
Been busy?

01:28:49.269 --> 01:28:51.344
You know,
I've thought about this moment...

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:54.012
...every day for the last 20 years...

01:28:54.274 --> 01:28:57.891
- Oh...
...wondering what I would say to you...

01:28:58.069 --> 01:28:59.563
...what I would do to you.

01:29:00.113 --> 01:29:03.979
And if this was a week ago...

01:29:04.157 --> 01:29:08.619
...I would have attacked you all
like a fierce wolverine.

01:29:08.788 --> 01:29:11.325
I'm glad it wasn't last week, then.

01:29:11.498 --> 01:29:13.324
Pulled the skin from your faces...

01:29:14.167 --> 01:29:19.707
...and treated myself to some
human carpaccio or face jerky.

01:29:20.256 --> 01:29:22.961
But that is just not me anymore.

01:29:23.135 --> 01:29:25.422
So I wanna say to you right now...

01:29:26.261 --> 01:29:28.420
...have a great show.

01:29:28.597 --> 01:29:29.878
Oh...

01:29:30.057 --> 01:29:33.758
Cheers, man.
Come on, for old times' sake.

01:29:38.314 --> 01:29:42.977
Not bad, huh? D.V. coming
through for you. Meeting your heroes.

01:29:43.153 --> 01:29:44.945
Let's do this. Woo-hoo!

01:31:11.193 --> 01:31:12.687
Yeah!

01:31:13.195 --> 01:31:15.272
I know that guy.

01:31:19.743 --> 01:31:21.071
I love you, Matt.

01:31:26.374 --> 01:31:28.201
Yeah! Whoo!

01:31:37.302 --> 01:31:38.927
Yes. Yes!

01:31:39.095 --> 01:31:40.719
You rocked it.

01:31:44.141 --> 01:31:45.172
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:31:45.601 --> 01:31:47.225
So good.
- Yes.

01:31:47.394 --> 01:31:49.019
- Great show.
- Yeah, you too.

01:31:50.773 --> 01:31:56.014
So I was wondering maybe if later
you'd wanna get a bite to eat.

01:31:56.194 --> 01:31:58.483
Sure. Yeah. I'll tell Mattie.

01:31:59.906 --> 01:32:05.113
I was thinking maybe, you know,
just me and you could go together.

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:06.780
Oh.

01:32:08.872 --> 01:32:10.117
Yeah.

01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:11.951
I mean, you know, that'd be cool.

01:32:12.585 --> 01:32:14.329
All right.

01:32:18.048 --> 01:32:19.507
Hey.

01:32:20.342 --> 01:32:21.753
There it is.

01:32:22.802 --> 01:32:25.128
So good, man. You were so good.

01:32:25.305 --> 01:32:28.140
Sweetie, you were wonderful.
Fish, that was awesome.

01:32:28.308 --> 01:32:29.338
Thanks.

01:32:29.516 --> 01:32:31.426
- Nice haircut, by the way.
- Thank you.

01:32:31.602 --> 01:32:36.265
I heard women
like a more mature look, so...

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.432
I liked your look.

01:32:39.025 --> 01:32:40.057
- Come here.
- Ah, ah.

01:32:40.235 --> 01:32:43.520
- I'm kind of... You know? You sure?
- I don't care.

01:32:49.953 --> 01:32:53.286
<i>All hail the mighty...</i>

01:32:53.456 --> 01:32:57.371
<i>... Vesuvius.</i>

01:34:00.018 --> 01:34:02.307
Oh, my God. They're lip-synching.

01:34:10.569 --> 01:34:11.815
It's a live mike.

01:34:11.988 --> 01:34:14.230
- They're lip-synching.
- They're lip-synching.

01:34:14.407 --> 01:34:16.483
Get out there and do something.

01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:20.198
Keep going.

01:34:24.207 --> 01:34:25.951
Oh, no.

01:34:26.126 --> 01:34:28.452
We got an Ashlee Simpson
situation here.

01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:35.543
You suck.

01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:44.057
Go back to Cleveland, Cleveland.

01:34:48.731 --> 01:34:50.391
Go away.

01:34:52.067 --> 01:34:55.068
You guys suck.
- Losers.

01:35:00.617 --> 01:35:02.776
<i>A.D.D. A.D.D.</i>

01:35:02.953 --> 01:35:07.946
<i>A.D.D. A.D.D. A.D.D. A.D.D.</i>

01:35:08.124 --> 01:35:10.413
It's insane.
- What do you think?

01:35:10.752 --> 01:35:12.412
I think...

01:35:12.754 --> 01:35:16.372
...they're calling our names.
Come on. Let's roll.

01:35:16.549 --> 01:35:20.213
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It is not a good idea to go out there.

01:35:20.385 --> 01:35:23.055
It's Vesuvius' show.
Don't wanna make them look bad.

01:35:23.222 --> 01:35:27.006
And you'll piss off the record company,
which I do not suggest you do.

01:35:27.184 --> 01:35:29.472
These people came here
for live music.

01:35:29.644 --> 01:35:33.772
Screw these people. It's a free show,
dumbass. You don't have a choice.

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:36.063
- David's right.
- Thank you.

01:35:36.234 --> 01:35:39.188
We don't have a choice.
We gotta go up there.

01:35:39.362 --> 01:35:41.567
By the way, you better not be here
when we get back.

01:35:41.738 --> 01:35:43.530
We're gonna look
for new management.

01:35:43.699 --> 01:35:46.784
I love this kid. Love him.
You speak your mind.

01:35:46.953 --> 01:35:51.448
You have integrity. You inspire me.
You're like 6, and you inspire me.

01:35:51.623 --> 01:35:54.826
Hey. Read my lips, asshole.
You're fired.

01:35:57.295 --> 01:36:01.625
- Let's go. Come on.
- You're a bad man.

01:36:02.924 --> 01:36:03.956
Come on, guys.
