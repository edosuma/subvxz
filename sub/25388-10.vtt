00:30.489 --> 00:31.906
Cooper?

00:37.153 --> 00:38.654
Cooper!

00:43.104 --> 00:45.438
Mom?! Mom!

00:45.439 --> 00:46.857
W-What's happening?!

01:04.000 --> 01:05.586
I love wine country.

01:05.586 --> 01:08.046
Hard to believe it's just
two hours outside the city.

01:08.047 --> 01:10.048
Yeah, and a world away.

01:10.049 --> 01:11.675
You know, one of my dreams

01:11.676 --> 01:14.260
was to retire to the country
and own a winery,

01:14.261 --> 01:16.471
like Francis Coppola or Kurt Russell.

01:16.472 --> 01:18.682
But that was before I went all pre-hab.

01:18.683 --> 01:20.308
I was gonna call it Swift Wines.

01:20.309 --> 01:21.893
I even had an ad campaign.

01:21.894 --> 01:23.269
"Swift Wines,

01:23.270 --> 01:26.106
because other wines are not so swift."

01:26.107 --> 01:27.554
Did you come up with that yourself?

01:27.555 --> 01:28.650
Yeah. You like it?

01:28.651 --> 01:31.152
Let's just say... not so swift.

01:31.153 --> 01:32.696
All right, come on. Stop.

01:32.697 --> 01:35.365
I mean, it was a slow pitch
right up the middle.

01:35.366 --> 01:37.201
Oh, wait. There's Stillwater just ahead.

01:38.369 --> 01:40.036
I've never even heard of Stillwater.

01:40.037 --> 01:41.830
- How did this kid find us?
- He's a fan of mine.

01:41.831 --> 01:43.665
He read all those articles on us.

01:43.666 --> 01:45.333
We're the only P. I. s
he's ever heard of.

01:45.334 --> 01:47.127
And so, what, he said his mom disappeared

01:47.128 --> 01:48.962
and local authorities
aren't doing anything about it?

01:48.963 --> 01:50.422
Yeah, that's why he needs us.

01:50.423 --> 01:52.632
And he didn't say anything
about what happened to her?

01:52.633 --> 01:55.009
He did say he thinks
she might have been taken.

01:55.010 --> 01:57.137
"Taken." Oh.

01:57.138 --> 01:59.180
Because you never said anything
about her being taken.

01:59.181 --> 02:00.515
By whom?

02:00.516 --> 02:02.642
You know, he wasn't...
clear on that point,

02:02.643 --> 02:04.561
but I'm sure he's gonna tell us
more once we get there.

02:23.164 --> 02:26.291
You must be the P. I. s from L. A.
that Cooper hired.

02:26.292 --> 02:28.168
Eddie Valetik. This is Sam Swift.

02:28.169 --> 02:29.669
Hi.

02:29.670 --> 02:31.212
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way out here.

02:31.213 --> 02:33.131
We've got the situation
pretty much in hand.

02:33.132 --> 02:35.341
- So you found Cooper's mom?
- Well, no.

02:35.342 --> 02:36.718
So she's still missing?

02:36.719 --> 02:38.303
Well, technically, yes.

02:38.304 --> 02:40.250
So then the situation is not in hand?

02:40.251 --> 02:41.870
It's barely been 18 hours.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.957
I know Kay. I'm sure she'll show up.

02:43.957 --> 02:46.041
Four out of five
reported missing-persons...

02:46.042 --> 02:47.501
they're either found

02:47.502 --> 02:50.129
or they return voluntarily
within 48 to 72 hours.

02:50.130 --> 02:53.006
So, w-what's your plan? Just wait?

02:53.007 --> 02:55.968
What's your angle here?
You just looking for publicity?

02:55.969 --> 02:58.512
Maybe you're gonna use this
for a TV show or something?

02:58.513 --> 03:01.181
We're just... We're just trying
to find the kid's mom.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.426
You got a problem with that?

03:02.427 --> 03:05.273
Yeah, I have a problem. This is my town.

03:05.274 --> 03:07.609
We don't need outsiders like you

03:07.610 --> 03:09.527
trying to make us look
like laughingstocks

03:09.528 --> 03:12.572
by taking advantage
of some misguided kid.

03:12.573 --> 03:14.574
You want to play Mulder and Scully?

03:14.575 --> 03:16.409
Do it someplace else.

03:16.410 --> 03:18.286
"Take advantage"? "Mulder and Scully"?

03:18.287 --> 03:19.914
What is he talking about?

03:20.989 --> 03:24.451
Sam... What aren't you telling me?

03:26.396 --> 03:28.689
I think you better let Cooper explain.

03:28.690 --> 03:30.316
Mr. Valetik. Miss Swift.

03:30.317 --> 03:31.859
I-I... I can't believe you came.

03:31.860 --> 03:34.069
Come in, please. Come in.

03:34.070 --> 03:37.573
Just promise to listen, okay?
A-And keep an open mind.

03:43.371 --> 03:45.591
Uh, watch your step.
I didn't touch anything...

03:45.592 --> 03:48.125
figured you guys would want
to gather some evidence.

03:48.126 --> 03:50.102
Thanks, Cooper. That's smart.

03:50.102 --> 03:51.477
So how long's your mother been gone?

03:51.478 --> 03:53.955
Since last night, about 14 hours.

03:53.956 --> 03:56.750
And Sam says you think
she may have been abducted?

03:56.751 --> 04:00.253
I don't think. I know. I saw it happen.

04:00.254 --> 04:01.504
Why don't you tell Mr. Valetik

04:01.505 --> 04:02.797
what happened from the beginning?

04:02.798 --> 04:04.507
Uh, I go to Chico State.

04:04.508 --> 04:06.551
I'm home for the summer,
taking care of the mom.

04:06.552 --> 04:09.179
I'd heard the stories
about what's going on in town.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.531
Stories?

04:10.532 --> 04:14.410
I was upstairs sleeping
when I felt this vibration.

04:14.411 --> 04:17.413
Then I heard my mom start screaming,

04:17.414 --> 04:20.853
so I-I came downstairs,
and it was like daylight.

04:20.855 --> 04:22.439
Light was coming in from everywhere,

04:22.440 --> 04:24.983
and that was when I saw it
standing in the doorway.

04:24.984 --> 04:27.319
- "It"?
- I-I could barely make it out

04:27.320 --> 04:30.888
with all the light in my eyes,
but it was tall, thin,

04:30.888 --> 04:33.807
and, like I told Miss Swift,
definitely not human.

04:33.808 --> 04:36.760
"Like you told Miss Swift"?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.155
Then I blacked out.

04:39.180 --> 04:41.933
After I came to, my mom was gone,

04:41.958 --> 04:44.043
but her wheelchair is still here.

04:44.068 --> 04:45.945
She can't get around without it,

04:45.970 --> 04:47.847
so she must have been taken.

04:47.947 --> 04:52.867
And what exactly
do you think this thing was?

04:54.370 --> 04:56.715
- Aliens?
- Alleged aliens.

04:56.716 --> 04:59.635
You knew about this,
and you still took the case?

04:59.636 --> 05:01.094
The kid was crying when he called, okay?

05:01.095 --> 05:02.095
He sounded desperate.

05:02.096 --> 05:04.262
Desperate or crazy?

05:04.262 --> 05:05.805
Why didn't you tell me about this?

05:05.806 --> 05:07.682
- Because I knew you'd say no.
- Yeah, that's right.

05:07.683 --> 05:08.933
And you know why I would have said no?

05:08.934 --> 05:10.686
I want to say... aliens?

05:10.711 --> 05:12.505
- You think?
- Come on, Eddie.

05:12.530 --> 05:14.824
There are billions of planets
in the galaxy, okay?

05:14.849 --> 05:16.934
Is it so crazy to think
that there could be other beings

05:16.959 --> 05:18.382
roaming the vast universe?

05:18.407 --> 05:21.612
No, no. But it is crazy to think
that an advanced civilization

05:21.637 --> 05:22.768
would just pop into Stillwater

05:22.769 --> 05:25.229
to abduct a wheelchair-bound
woman from her living room.

05:25.230 --> 05:27.012
Look, I know how it sounds,

05:27.037 --> 05:28.900
but she is not the first.

05:28.901 --> 05:30.943
A-A-A bunch of other people in Stillwater

05:30.944 --> 05:32.570
have been abducted in the last two weeks.

05:32.571 --> 05:33.738
"A bunch"?

05:33.739 --> 05:35.615
Yeah. Two that I know of for sure.

05:35.616 --> 05:37.742
Hey, Cooper. Can you give us a sec?

05:37.743 --> 05:39.243
Sure.

05:41.878 --> 05:44.296
Look, Eddie. His mom is missing.

05:44.297 --> 05:46.798
Was it aliens? Probably not.

05:46.799 --> 05:48.300
Okay, fine. Of course not.

05:48.301 --> 05:50.677
But that means someone else took her.

05:50.678 --> 05:52.804
The kid's all alone,
and he needs our help.

06:01.352 --> 06:04.021
Um, what kind of condition
does your mom have?

06:04.022 --> 06:07.535
They think it might be MS.
Started two years ago.

06:07.536 --> 06:10.746
Her paralysis has gotten steadily worse,

06:10.747 --> 06:13.124
so she can't get around
without that wheelchair.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.276
And you said you were upstairs
when you heard her scream?

06:15.277 --> 06:18.045
Yeah. I wasn't feeling well,
so I went to lay down.

06:18.046 --> 06:20.071
Then I heard her yelling out for me.

06:21.091 --> 06:22.717
Are these divorce papers?

06:22.718 --> 06:26.220
Yeah. Uh, last month my mom split up

06:26.221 --> 06:28.858
with a mistake named Chuck.

06:28.858 --> 06:30.192
He is not my dad.

06:30.193 --> 06:32.611
I take it you don't like Chuck.

06:32.612 --> 06:34.738
He was nice when they first got together,

06:34.739 --> 06:36.485
but then my mom got sick.

06:36.486 --> 06:38.241
Chuck helped her out for a while,

06:38.242 --> 06:39.969
but then he had his own problems.

06:39.970 --> 06:43.597
Became selfish, belligerent, drank a lot.

06:43.598 --> 06:47.101
She couldn't put up with it,
so she kicked him out.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.937
Well, looks like their split
was getting ugly and expensive.

06:49.938 --> 06:52.231
Did Chuck ever get violent
towards your mom?

06:52.232 --> 06:56.707
Yeah. Uh, she had to get a
restraining order against him.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.584
But what I saw in the doorway,
that was not Chuck.

06:59.609 --> 07:01.704
Well, you said you saw a bright light,

07:01.729 --> 07:04.440
and that's a pretty big
light bar on his truck.

07:04.465 --> 07:09.303
Yeah, but the thing was tall and thin.

07:09.328 --> 07:10.579
Chuck is not that.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.649
Cooper, you know how, uh,
light bends around people

07:13.674 --> 07:15.342
when the light's bright enough
from behind them?

07:15.367 --> 07:16.660
I mean, the light was bright enough.

07:16.685 --> 07:18.354
I know what I saw.

07:18.379 --> 07:20.255
Then is it possible
there's another explanation?

07:21.433 --> 07:23.142
Your mom and Chuck had been fighting,

07:23.143 --> 07:25.478
you come home, you hear stories
about abductions,

07:25.479 --> 07:27.104
your mom screams, Chuck comes in,

07:27.105 --> 07:29.774
you see someone standing in the
doorway, back-lit by a truck.

07:29.775 --> 07:31.818
And since you weren't
feeling well, you pass out.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.321
That does sound more logical than aliens.

07:34.854 --> 07:37.148
You really think it was Chuck?

07:37.173 --> 07:38.591
I think we need to talk to him.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.139
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.623
Sam said I could use her office
to study for summer finals.

07:46.624 --> 07:48.167
Where is she, anyway?

07:48.168 --> 07:49.793
Up in a town called Stillwater.

07:49.794 --> 07:51.044
Some kid hired them.

07:51.045 --> 07:53.172
He thinks his mom was abducted by aliens.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.549
She probably was.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.886
Stillwater was the site of
an alien craft landing in 1972.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.546
- You're joking, right?
- Look it up.

08:07.326 --> 08:08.619
You're not joking.

08:12.132 --> 08:13.425
Wait.

08:13.450 --> 08:15.494
You just happen to know that. Why?

08:15.519 --> 08:17.642
I had an encounter once,
so I read up on them.

08:17.667 --> 08:18.869
They're pretty common.

08:18.894 --> 08:20.295
Okay.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.475
You're judging me.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.918
No.

08:22.953 --> 08:24.829
I'm not.

08:24.830 --> 08:26.447
Mnh-mnh.

08:26.448 --> 08:27.865
If there's been another abduction,

08:27.866 --> 08:29.615
it's possible the alien craft is back.

08:29.616 --> 08:30.702
I can put out feelers.

08:32.057 --> 08:33.183
"Feelers"?

08:33.207 --> 08:34.543
To the UFO community.

08:34.568 --> 08:36.820
Oh. So not literal feelers?

08:39.870 --> 08:42.289
I'll be out there.

08:46.271 --> 08:48.134
Well, there's your UFO.

08:48.134 --> 08:50.636
For the record, I liked
the alien story better.

08:50.637 --> 08:51.846
How do you know it's better?

08:51.847 --> 08:53.013
I mean, you think if there are aliens,

08:53.014 --> 08:54.598
it's a cute, little E. T.?

08:54.599 --> 08:57.393
What if it's a Predator that
just wants to rip your arms off?

08:57.394 --> 08:59.562
Wow. Did you not get hugged
enough as a child?

09:01.926 --> 09:03.844
Eddie. Wait. Do you see that sign?

09:03.845 --> 09:05.178
What, the "No Trespassing"?

09:05.179 --> 09:06.430
We'll say we didn't see it.

09:06.431 --> 09:08.239
No. That sign.

09:08.721 --> 09:10.890
He's probably just trying
to scare people off.

09:10.915 --> 09:12.750
"Probably"? Well,
that makes me feel a lot better.

09:14.564 --> 09:18.066
There's blood.
The trail leads into the shed.

09:18.067 --> 09:20.569
Is it me, or does that blood
look pretty fresh?

09:22.126 --> 09:24.045
One more step, and your blood
will look pretty fresh.

09:24.070 --> 09:25.237
You must be Chuck.

09:25.491 --> 09:27.291
You must be trespassing.

09:27.316 --> 09:29.099
We're private investigators.

09:29.124 --> 09:31.303
We're looking for Kay Winston,
your ex. You seen her?

09:31.328 --> 09:32.765
Not on purpose.

09:32.790 --> 09:35.273
And I ain't got nothing to do
with her disappearance, either.

09:35.298 --> 09:36.925
So you know she's missing?

09:36.950 --> 09:38.174
Small town. People talk.

09:38.199 --> 09:39.386
What's in the shed?

09:39.411 --> 09:42.373
Killed a deer yesterday.
I'm curing the meat inside.

09:42.398 --> 09:44.324
- You mind if we take a look?
- Yes, I do.

09:44.349 --> 09:45.695
You ain't cops. You ain't got a warrant.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.403
You got no business here,

09:47.428 --> 09:49.713
so I suggest you get the hell
off my property.

09:52.951 --> 09:54.117
Real charmer.

09:54.142 --> 09:56.063
Can't imagine why it didn't
work out between him and Kay.

09:56.088 --> 09:57.965
- What's our play?
- We check out that shed.

09:57.990 --> 09:59.324
Well, I think we established
pretty firmly

09:59.349 --> 10:00.601
that he didn't want you to.

10:00.626 --> 10:02.836
He has to sleep sometime.

10:07.793 --> 10:09.127
What time is it?

10:11.763 --> 10:13.515
It's 3:00 a. m.

10:13.540 --> 10:15.640
The man likes his beer.

10:16.898 --> 10:19.984
All right. Wait a second.
It looks like he's going in.

10:19.985 --> 10:21.694
All right. When he shuts off the lights,

10:21.695 --> 10:23.022
we'll go check out the shed.

10:26.032 --> 10:28.158
You know, I kind of wish
there were aliens,

10:28.159 --> 10:31.079
something out there
that's greater than all this.

10:32.461 --> 10:33.963
Have you ever looked up

10:33.988 --> 10:36.157
and wondered if there's
other civilizations up there

10:36.182 --> 10:37.609
wondering about us?

10:37.634 --> 10:40.804
When I was a kid, I would listen
to my dad on his ham radio,

10:40.829 --> 10:42.789
and he'd talk to people from all over...

10:42.814 --> 10:45.734
Mexico, Hawaii, Panama.

10:45.759 --> 10:47.886
I remember this one night
we heard the strangest sounds,

10:47.911 --> 10:50.872
like these high-pitched noises
and clicks.

10:50.897 --> 10:53.525
My dad said they were aliens
from another world.

10:54.834 --> 10:56.085
Did you believe him?

10:56.110 --> 10:57.362
Of course I did. I was 10.

10:57.387 --> 10:59.055
I mean, I used to build spaceship models

10:59.080 --> 11:00.615
and pretend I was Han Solo.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.525
And for months, I would sit
around that ham radio

11:02.550 --> 11:04.135
and just wait for that sound
to come back.

11:09.657 --> 11:11.325
Did it sound like that?

11:11.350 --> 11:14.603
No. That, uh... That was strange.

11:18.949 --> 11:20.909
He just turned the lights off.

11:23.611 --> 11:24.904
Let's go.

11:27.749 --> 11:28.750
Eddie?

11:36.390 --> 11:39.601
All right. You know there's got
to be some logical explanation.

11:39.626 --> 11:41.336
What? 'Cause it sure as hell

11:41.361 --> 11:42.821
wasn't the light bar on Chuck's truck.

11:42.846 --> 11:44.077
We saw him go into the house,

11:44.081 --> 11:45.386
we saw him turn off his bedroom light,

11:45.387 --> 11:47.433
and when we ran in there,
he was gone, so where'd he go?

11:47.433 --> 11:48.850
I don't know. Maybe he snuck out back.

11:48.851 --> 11:50.268
And the "Close Encounters" light show?

11:50.269 --> 11:52.283
Just that. A show.
Like... Like in the movies.

11:52.283 --> 11:54.368
I mean, you of all people should
know about special effects.

11:54.369 --> 11:56.648
Except lights like that require stands,

11:56.649 --> 11:58.729
heavy equipment, beefy union guys, okay?

11:58.730 --> 12:00.814
There was no evidence
of any of that around the house,

12:00.815 --> 12:03.734
not to mention tens of thousands
of dollars to pay for it,

12:03.735 --> 12:05.861
which, looking at Chuck's house,
I'm betting he doesn't have.

12:05.862 --> 12:08.073
No sign of Chuck or Kay.

12:08.837 --> 12:10.616
So where is he?

12:10.617 --> 12:12.284
Well, knowing Chuck,
probably out on a bender.

12:12.285 --> 12:13.869
Without his pickup truck?

12:13.870 --> 12:15.788
Just like Kay was taken
without her wheelchair?

12:15.789 --> 12:17.539
How does that make any sense?

12:17.540 --> 12:19.876
We saw Chuck in his house just before...

12:21.022 --> 12:23.483
Before what? The aliens came?

12:23.508 --> 12:26.386
Did you get any video of it or pictures?

12:26.411 --> 12:28.079
So, really, all I have to go on

12:28.104 --> 12:30.942
is your word about the lights
or Chuck even being here?

12:30.967 --> 12:32.160
Did you check the shed?

12:32.207 --> 12:34.597
Yeah, it's a dead deer.

12:34.597 --> 12:36.432
Look, I know you mean well,

12:36.433 --> 12:39.351
but there's simply
no evidence of a crime here.

12:39.352 --> 12:41.479
You folks have a nice ride back to L. A.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.030
Did you see that?

12:44.031 --> 12:45.531
He's trying to shut down
our investigation.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.741
I mean, come on. Do you blame him?

12:46.742 --> 12:49.035
Even I think our story sounds crazy.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.494
We know what we saw.

12:50.495 --> 12:51.737
Something is going on here, okay?

12:51.738 --> 12:53.482
Whatever it is,
I bet the sheriff is in on it.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.899
Or he isn't, all right?

12:54.900 --> 12:56.567
And... And Chuck staged this whole thing.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.444
Maybe he put on this whole show
to distract us

12:58.445 --> 12:59.820
so he can take Kay's body from the shed,

12:59.821 --> 13:01.280
and then he left town
to cover his tracks.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.074
Left town in what?

13:03.075 --> 13:05.452
His truck is still here.

13:07.192 --> 13:09.528
Cooper said there had been
other abductions.

13:09.553 --> 13:10.804
Maybe one of those people

13:10.829 --> 13:12.331
can help us understand
what's really going on.

13:13.886 --> 13:15.595
There have been whispers recently,

13:15.596 --> 13:18.353
people going missing,
mysteriously returning.

13:18.353 --> 13:19.937
People don't like to talk about it

13:19.938 --> 13:21.272
because everyone thinks they're crazy,

13:21.273 --> 13:23.399
but you guys saw it, too.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.642
Well, we're not exactly sure what we saw.

13:25.642 --> 13:28.602
Are you kidding?
We saw exactly what Cooper saw.

13:28.603 --> 13:30.396
You said that you know other
people this has happened to.

13:30.397 --> 13:31.795
Do you think one of them
might talk to us?

13:31.796 --> 13:33.672
Even if they weren't taken by aliens,

13:33.673 --> 13:35.924
it might help us figure out
what happened to your mom.

13:35.925 --> 13:38.552
There's one guy... Arlo Hayes.

13:38.553 --> 13:39.761
Said he was taken a few weeks back.

13:39.762 --> 13:40.906
Where can we find him?

13:40.906 --> 13:41.906
- Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

13:41.907 --> 13:43.824
Uh, he almost always has breakfast

13:43.825 --> 13:45.367
at the Five Corners Cafe.

13:56.575 --> 13:59.411
You get the feeling
we're not welcome here, either?

13:59.412 --> 14:01.036
Well, either that or these people have

14:01.061 --> 14:02.831
an odd way of showing their hospitality.

14:02.832 --> 14:04.624
Maybe it's not just the sheriff
who's in on it.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.501
Maybe it's the whole town.

14:06.502 --> 14:09.129
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

14:09.130 --> 14:10.880
We're looking for an Arlo Hayes.

14:10.881 --> 14:12.221
Is Arlo looking for you?

14:12.221 --> 14:14.305
Well, he will be when he finds
out I'm paying for his meal.

14:14.306 --> 14:16.849
Thelma, bring me a steak
with all the trimmings

14:16.850 --> 14:18.341
and a piece of pie.

14:22.189 --> 14:24.013
Hey, Arlo. Mind if we have a seat?

14:28.038 --> 14:30.071
We're wondering if we can ask
you a few questions.

14:30.072 --> 14:31.252
Depends on the questions.

14:31.253 --> 14:33.616
Well, we heard it through the grapevine

14:33.617 --> 14:35.079
that you might have a story to tell.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.040
Are you the private detectives
Cooper hired?

14:38.041 --> 14:40.791
Well, I guess word travels fast
around this town.

14:40.792 --> 14:44.464
Arlo, we just want to know what happened.

14:45.963 --> 14:48.216
Look, Cooper is worried sick
about his mom.

14:48.241 --> 14:50.456
Can you tell us anything
to help us find her?

14:51.185 --> 14:52.750
Okay. You want to know the truth?

14:53.857 --> 14:55.692
There is no story.

14:55.717 --> 14:58.678
I made it all up to get attention. Sorry.

14:58.703 --> 15:01.623
Thelma, I'll take that steak to go.

15:04.327 --> 15:05.996
Friendly town.

15:06.021 --> 15:07.807
It's nothing personal.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.865
It's just these rumors
about aliens and abductions...

15:11.890 --> 15:13.167
well, it's bad for Stillwater.

15:13.192 --> 15:14.427
People come here for the wine.

15:14.452 --> 15:16.207
We don't want to be the butt of jokes.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.734
Well, we're not here to cause trouble,

15:17.759 --> 15:19.450
just to solve a missing-person's case.

15:19.475 --> 15:21.237
Tell that to my customers.

15:21.774 --> 15:24.777
My winery up the road... we have
a world-class reputation.

15:24.802 --> 15:27.597
What happens to that
if these UFO fanatics

15:27.622 --> 15:29.916
get wind of these rumors,

15:29.941 --> 15:32.373
try to turn this place
into the next Area 51?

15:32.778 --> 15:34.363
Look, we're not out to hurt this town.

15:34.388 --> 15:36.377
We just want to help Cooper
find his mother.

15:37.294 --> 15:40.589
Stillwater's been burned before,
so we're careful up here.

15:40.614 --> 15:43.593
Well, hey, the sooner we find
Kay, the sooner we'll leave.

15:44.570 --> 15:47.114
Well, I hope you find her.
She's a good lady.

15:48.741 --> 15:49.991
It's like we're in one of those westerns

15:49.992 --> 15:51.493
where the town has a secret,

15:51.494 --> 15:53.244
but they don't want strangers
to know about it.

15:53.245 --> 15:55.455
You know what's strange
is that we've been here a day

15:55.456 --> 15:57.374
and we still don't have a clue
as to what happened to Kay.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.001
Well, we have one clue
about what happened.

16:00.628 --> 16:02.462
- Don't say it.
- Fine. I won't say it.

16:02.463 --> 16:03.463
Aliens!

16:03.464 --> 16:05.131
Excuse me.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.842
Uh, sorry about that back there.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.608
There's two kinds of folks in town...

16:09.633 --> 16:11.593
those who've had encounters
and those who haven't,

16:11.618 --> 16:13.498
and neither of them want to hear me talk.

16:14.245 --> 16:16.122
But if you want to know
what happened, I'll tell you.

16:16.147 --> 16:17.273
We're listening.

16:17.298 --> 16:18.758
They took me from my house.

16:18.783 --> 16:20.458
First, I heard the hum,

16:20.483 --> 16:22.773
then I saw the lights, and then I saw it.

16:23.055 --> 16:26.016
Tall, thin, coming toward me.

16:26.041 --> 16:27.835
I tried to run,

16:27.860 --> 16:29.278
but I was swallowed in the light.

16:29.303 --> 16:31.931
Next thing I know... poof...
I wake up in their ship.

16:31.956 --> 16:35.584
It was like a dream... dark... light.

16:35.609 --> 16:37.007
And then they messed with my brain.

16:37.032 --> 16:38.289
Messed with your brain how?

16:38.314 --> 16:40.441
They made it so I couldn't speak right.

16:40.466 --> 16:41.841
Every time I opened my mouth,

16:41.866 --> 16:45.162
all that came out was gibberish,
like I had no control.

16:45.187 --> 16:46.471
And how did you get back?

16:46.496 --> 16:47.949
No idea. I passed out.

16:48.255 --> 16:50.591
Next thing I knew, Harry Bueller found me

16:50.616 --> 16:54.078
wandering dazed down Highway 126
and brought me in.

16:54.103 --> 16:55.187
Where on 126?

16:56.195 --> 16:59.085
Wait. Mile marker 119?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.377
Yeah. That's where Arlo Hayes
claims was found.

17:01.402 --> 17:03.231
Right here. Why?

17:03.256 --> 17:06.717
Someone in the community sent me
this article back from '72.

17:07.471 --> 17:08.556
Where'd you get this?

17:08.580 --> 17:10.415
There's a vast online network of people

17:10.441 --> 17:12.238
who communicate about all things alien...

17:12.246 --> 17:14.039
sightings, abductions, encounters.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.284
But look at the headline.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.250
It says they took place near Elk Lake.

17:17.251 --> 17:20.587
Right there... mile marker 119.

17:20.588 --> 17:21.880
Okay, that's weird.

17:21.881 --> 17:23.214
Not necessarily.

17:23.214 --> 17:25.884
Maybe the craft that was sighted in 1972

17:25.885 --> 17:27.719
has returned to the same spot.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.166
Do you think it's odd that there were

17:29.191 --> 17:31.598
spacecraft sightings up here in '72?

17:31.599 --> 17:33.533
If you're an alien,
why would you come back now?

17:33.533 --> 17:35.576
Really? That's what you find odd?

17:35.577 --> 17:37.828
Look, I'm not saying it's an alien, okay?

17:37.829 --> 17:40.039
But if Arlo was found here

17:40.040 --> 17:42.333
and there were other sightings
reported here in the past,

17:42.334 --> 17:43.959
then maybe it's all connected.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.753
Connected to what?

17:45.754 --> 17:48.006
What makes you think
Arlo's telling the truth?

17:50.467 --> 17:52.009
Pretty sure he was telling the truth.

17:56.556 --> 17:58.432
Is she... She's alive.

17:58.433 --> 18:00.185
But someone must have left her here.

18:01.615 --> 18:02.908
It's ash.

18:04.635 --> 18:07.012
The circle's been burned into the ground.

18:07.037 --> 18:08.372
Stay here.

18:29.298 --> 18:31.261
How are you doing, Ma?

18:31.286 --> 18:33.455
Oh, I'm just so glad to be back home.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.483
Her lying there in the woods
right where Arlo was found,

18:36.508 --> 18:38.051
the scorch marks on the ground...

18:38.076 --> 18:39.703
I-I'm waiting for a logical explanation.

18:39.728 --> 18:42.271
I'm sure there will be once
we get her side of the story.

18:42.699 --> 18:45.110
You know, you've been really
quiet ever since the woods.

18:45.135 --> 18:46.395
What did you see out there?

18:46.420 --> 18:47.622
Nothing.

18:47.622 --> 18:49.707
Just movement. I don't know.

18:49.708 --> 18:52.084
Thank you both so much.

18:52.085 --> 18:53.961
I could've died if you hadn't
found me out there.

18:53.962 --> 18:56.309
Yeah. What about before we found you?

18:56.334 --> 18:58.336
You... Do you remember what happened?

18:58.361 --> 19:02.208
Uh, after the light
and seeing that thing,

19:02.765 --> 19:07.129
I woke up in some strange
dark space that I...

19:07.154 --> 19:10.449
tried to call for help,
but words didn't make sense.

19:10.474 --> 19:13.894
And then nothing
till I woke in the woods.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.875
Your vitals are normal, Kay.
Strong, even.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.115
I'm gonna run some blood tests,
but you seem to be fine.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.685
Honestly, I feel better
than I have in years.

19:20.710 --> 19:22.086
It's almost as if...

19:23.484 --> 19:24.526
My legs.

19:24.551 --> 19:25.719
Mom?

19:26.937 --> 19:29.023
W-W-What are you...

19:29.048 --> 19:30.820
I can walk again.

19:30.866 --> 19:32.493
I can walk.

19:32.518 --> 19:35.270
I can walk.

19:39.140 --> 19:40.849
Oh, hey, Berto.
I'm gonna send you some names

19:40.850 --> 19:42.475
of people who have been abducted.

19:42.476 --> 19:44.333
Don't you mean allegedly abducted?

19:45.563 --> 19:48.607
Yeah. See if you can find
any connection between them.

19:48.608 --> 19:50.609
Are you okay? You sound spooked.

19:50.610 --> 19:52.402
I'm fine. Is... Is Monica there?

19:52.403 --> 19:55.238
Monica? Um... sure. Why?

19:55.239 --> 19:56.554
Just put her on.

19:57.435 --> 19:58.978
He wants to talk to you.

19:59.003 --> 20:00.359
Yo, what's up?

20:00.384 --> 20:01.719
Berto said that you've been
doing some research

20:01.744 --> 20:03.287
into the 1972 abductions?

20:03.312 --> 20:05.231
- Yeah.
- Have you come across any

20:05.256 --> 20:07.174
pictures or artist's renderings

20:07.199 --> 20:09.266
of what people claim
that these aliens look like?

20:09.291 --> 20:12.169
Just vague descriptions...
tall, thin, gray...

20:12.170 --> 20:14.213
but if you'd like, I can ask for one.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.339
Ask who?

20:15.340 --> 20:17.216
I found someone here in L. A.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.882
Says he was abducted
in Stillwater in 1972.

20:19.883 --> 20:21.509
Okay, all right. Well, see what you find,

20:21.510 --> 20:23.135
and then send me any information ASAP.

20:23.136 --> 20:24.262
Got it.

20:26.723 --> 20:29.128
Wait. We're researching aliens now?

20:32.966 --> 20:34.343
Send what ASAP?

20:34.368 --> 20:36.036
Uh, I asked Berto to look for links

20:36.061 --> 20:37.437
between Kay, Arlo, and Chuck.

20:37.462 --> 20:38.705
Told him to send me anything he finds.

20:38.730 --> 20:39.903
Well, whatever he finds,

20:39.928 --> 20:41.949
I don't think it'll explain
what we just saw.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.352
Eddie, that was crazy. She walked.

20:45.347 --> 20:47.972
Maybe the trauma
jolted her system, you know?

20:47.997 --> 20:49.890
Like those... those people
that get hit in the head

20:49.915 --> 20:52.084
and all of a sudden
they wake up speaking French.

20:52.109 --> 20:53.277
What are you suggesting?

20:53.302 --> 20:54.887
That aliens swooped in and healed her?

20:54.912 --> 20:56.163
No.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.365
Maybe.

20:58.134 --> 21:00.302
Dr. Drake, can we ask you something?

21:00.327 --> 21:02.330
How do you account for Kay's recovery?

21:02.355 --> 21:04.288
Oh, well, I can't, really.

21:04.799 --> 21:06.092
Though it's quite rare,

21:06.117 --> 21:08.452
spontaneous reversal of symptoms
can happen.

21:08.654 --> 21:10.127
Thanks.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.651
There's got to be an explanation.

21:15.676 --> 21:17.297
Okay, well, if you get one, let me know

21:17.322 --> 21:19.214
because this is really
starting to freak me out.

21:19.417 --> 21:21.377
You know, Arlo is the one
who sent us to those woods,

21:21.619 --> 21:23.933
and it's almost like he knew
exactly where to find Kay.

21:24.472 --> 21:26.891
Whatever's going on, he knows
more about it than he's saying.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.563
Yeah, I was in Stillwater back in '72.

21:31.622 --> 21:34.457
The fact is, I'd come home to die.

21:34.458 --> 21:37.335
Did you say "die," Mr. Carberry?

21:37.336 --> 21:40.199
I had terminal cancer, 29 years of age.

21:40.548 --> 21:42.633
The doctors gave me three months to live.

21:42.658 --> 21:44.535
But clearly you survived.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.854
And I attribute it
to the life-altering events

21:46.879 --> 21:50.027
of October 11, 1972.

21:50.052 --> 21:51.241
What happened?

21:51.266 --> 21:52.810
I thought my time had come.

21:52.835 --> 21:55.010
White light filled my room,

21:55.035 --> 21:56.328
and then I saw them...

21:56.353 --> 21:58.564
tall, thin, gray,

21:58.900 --> 22:00.553
coming toward me.

22:00.963 --> 22:02.130
And then what happened?

22:02.155 --> 22:04.700
I woke in a dark place.

22:04.725 --> 22:07.561
They were around me, over me,
laying their hands on me.

22:07.586 --> 22:09.796
I felt a sense of peace.

22:10.738 --> 22:14.074
Days later, I... I was found
unconscious in the woods,

22:14.099 --> 22:16.518
right near that spot that's on your map.

22:16.727 --> 22:18.312
And you know what they found

22:18.337 --> 22:19.880
when they took me to the hospital?

22:19.905 --> 22:21.073
What?

22:21.098 --> 22:22.475
Nothing.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.884
The tumors had vanished.

22:23.909 --> 22:29.313
I was completely cancer-free,
as I remain to this very day.

22:29.338 --> 22:31.182
They cured you?

22:31.207 --> 22:35.286
I haven't had so much as a cold
in 46 years.

22:35.311 --> 22:36.854
These aliens...

22:36.879 --> 22:39.091
can you tell me exactly
what they looked like?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.260
They've come back, haven't they?

22:42.861 --> 22:44.946
I always knew they would.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.899
Well? Are you convinced?

22:54.924 --> 22:56.843
Yeah.

22:56.868 --> 22:59.078
That he's got some major game
as a storyteller.

22:59.103 --> 23:01.736
Josiah Carberry's story has been
exhaustively documented.

23:01.736 --> 23:03.862
Even if the story is true,

23:03.863 --> 23:06.076
doesn't mean it has anything
to do with what's going on now.

23:06.077 --> 23:08.533
It has everything to do with it.

23:08.534 --> 23:10.718
I don't know anything more
than what I already told you.

23:10.718 --> 23:12.594
So it was a coincidence that you sent us

23:12.595 --> 23:14.221
to the area where we found Kay?

23:14.222 --> 23:16.098
I never sent you anywhere.
I was just trying to be helpful.

23:16.099 --> 23:17.683
I didn't know where she was. How could I?

23:17.684 --> 23:19.017
Arlo, let me ask you this.

23:19.018 --> 23:20.727
Did you have an illness
or medical problem

23:20.728 --> 23:21.979
when you were abducted?

23:21.980 --> 23:24.115
I had Bell's palsy...
you know, droopy face.

23:24.116 --> 23:25.607
Want to know what was weird?

23:25.608 --> 23:27.514
It went away right after they took me.

23:28.149 --> 23:30.943
What about Chuck?
Does he have any health issues?

23:30.968 --> 23:32.720
Chuck had a lame arm over a year now.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.830
Nerve damage or something.

23:34.855 --> 23:36.055
That's right.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.541
Remember he pulled his gun on us
with one arm?

23:38.566 --> 23:40.192
Thanks, Arlo.

23:41.471 --> 23:43.765
Arlo, Kay, and then Chuck...

23:43.790 --> 23:45.917
it's people with health problems
that are being abducted,

23:45.942 --> 23:47.284
like in '72.

23:47.309 --> 23:49.061
Look, healing aliens? Come on.

23:49.086 --> 23:50.473
It's got to be some kind of a hoax.

23:50.498 --> 23:52.550
A hoax where people are taken and cured?

23:52.575 --> 23:54.243
Maybe that's what they're doing
to Chuck right now.

23:56.462 --> 23:58.082
Valetik.

23:58.107 --> 24:00.193
Hey, so Josiah Carberry

24:00.218 --> 24:02.637
was able to identify a picture
of his abductors.

24:02.662 --> 24:03.871
I'm texting it to you now.

24:03.896 --> 24:05.855
- All right, thanks.
- Who was it?

24:05.880 --> 24:07.798
Uh, just... just give me one second.

24:12.144 --> 24:14.063
That's impossible.

24:14.088 --> 24:15.594
- Hey.
- What is this?

24:15.619 --> 24:16.989
Nothing, all right? It's just...

24:17.014 --> 24:18.684
What? What's wrong?

24:21.127 --> 24:23.670
Oh, my God. You saw this? In the woods?

24:23.671 --> 24:25.088
This is what you weren't telling me?

24:25.089 --> 24:27.264
I'm not sure what I saw, okay?

24:27.265 --> 24:30.385
Yes, you are. I can see it in your face.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.804
That's why you're pushing
this whole hoax theory.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.390
You don't want to admit that you saw
something that you can't explain.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.474
We need to go back there.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.643
Where? The woods?

24:37.644 --> 24:40.186
The truth is out there.
Eddie, we need to find it.

24:44.768 --> 24:47.186
Maybe Josiah Carberry was right.

24:47.187 --> 24:48.396
Maybe they're back.

24:48.397 --> 24:50.106
They're not back, and you know why?

24:50.107 --> 24:51.232
Because they were never here.

24:51.233 --> 24:52.900
Or they never left.

24:52.901 --> 24:54.302
What if it's like "Cocoon"

24:54.303 --> 24:55.929
where the aliens heal all the old people?

24:55.930 --> 24:57.403
"Cocoon" was a movie.

24:57.403 --> 24:58.736
Yeah, well, the writers
have to do research.

24:58.737 --> 25:00.196
Maybe it was based on something real.

25:00.197 --> 25:01.406
You know what is real?

25:01.407 --> 25:03.741
Spontaneous remission.
Happened to my uncle.

25:03.742 --> 25:05.159
He had lung cancer,

25:05.160 --> 25:07.245
then his tumors just disappeared.

25:07.246 --> 25:09.580
No treatment, no aliens, nothing.

25:09.581 --> 25:11.624
Okay, maybe if that happens once,

25:11.625 --> 25:13.584
but we're talking at least three times.

25:13.585 --> 25:15.545
That is more than just a coincidence.

25:15.546 --> 25:16.921
What about that thing you saw?

25:16.922 --> 25:18.673
Easy. It's just a simple delusion.

25:18.674 --> 25:21.400
I've been hearing about these
aliens nonstop, so I saw one.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.192
Do you realize that you're trying
to make sense of this case

25:23.193 --> 25:24.777
by arguing that you're delusional?

25:24.778 --> 25:26.153
Makes more sense than the alternative.

25:27.489 --> 25:28.698
What's that?

25:32.536 --> 25:33.744
Eddie?

25:33.745 --> 25:35.830
What the hell is that?

25:39.585 --> 25:40.585
It can't be.

25:40.586 --> 25:42.128
- Okay, did you just see that?
- Yes.

25:42.129 --> 25:44.338
- Was it the same one as before?
- Yes.

25:44.339 --> 25:45.673
So not a delusion?

25:45.674 --> 25:48.384
No. Unless we're both having it
at exactly the same time.

25:54.850 --> 25:57.393
Uh-oh.

26:14.530 --> 26:15.842
This is Eddie Valetik.

26:15.843 --> 26:18.456
Leave your name and message,
and I'll get back to you.

26:18.457 --> 26:19.940
Still no answer?

26:19.940 --> 26:22.024
Sam's phone's going
straight to voicemail, too.

26:22.025 --> 26:23.901
And I can't track them.
Their batteries must be dead.

26:23.902 --> 26:26.652
Or they're out of cell range. Way out.

26:27.493 --> 26:29.119
You don't think that...

26:29.120 --> 26:31.663
They went back to the woods.
Neither of us can reach them.

26:31.664 --> 26:33.206
Monica, there's no such thing as aliens.

26:33.207 --> 26:34.791
Then where are they?

26:57.149 --> 26:58.859
Hey. Wake up.

27:01.030 --> 27:02.990
Where are we?

27:03.015 --> 27:04.550
I don't know,

27:04.575 --> 27:07.044
but I don't think it's Stillwater.

27:07.069 --> 27:08.529
What's down there?

27:11.436 --> 27:13.480
I can't reach the floor,
if there even is one.

27:15.628 --> 27:18.213
What's the last thing you remember?

27:18.238 --> 27:20.573
We were in the woods,
and we saw that thing,

27:20.574 --> 27:22.575
and then there was that bright light.

27:22.576 --> 27:23.826
Does this feel like...

27:23.827 --> 27:25.954
The dark space that Kay and Arlo
described? Yeah.

27:25.955 --> 27:30.125
Hello? Is there anybody out there?

27:31.407 --> 27:32.783
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

27:32.808 --> 27:35.853
I'm trying really hard not to think it.

27:35.878 --> 27:38.172
Okay, just tell me this is
an elaborate hoax.

27:38.197 --> 27:39.406
It's... It's an elaborate hoax.

27:39.431 --> 27:40.572
I don't believe you.

27:40.597 --> 27:41.833
Want to know why I don't believe you?

27:41.858 --> 27:43.529
Because you don't believe you.

27:43.554 --> 27:45.314
How long do you think we've been in here?

27:46.307 --> 27:48.172
My watch stopped.

27:48.197 --> 27:49.568
Phone's dead.

27:50.846 --> 27:52.607
Mine too.

27:52.632 --> 27:53.874
Eddie?

27:53.899 --> 27:55.150
Yeah? If we get out of this,

27:55.175 --> 27:56.385
we need to get the hell
out of Stillwater.

27:58.286 --> 27:59.772
What was that?

28:03.712 --> 28:05.381
You see anything?

28:07.260 --> 28:08.678
I'm not sure that I want to.

28:10.296 --> 28:12.340
I'm sorry.

28:12.626 --> 28:13.835
For what?

28:13.860 --> 28:15.320
For getting us into this.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.734
You were just trying
to help a distraught kid.

28:16.759 --> 28:17.914
That's what we're supposed to do.

28:17.953 --> 28:19.163
Yeah, but if it weren't for me,

28:19.188 --> 28:21.982
we wouldn't be trapped
in some bizarro enclosure

28:22.007 --> 28:23.340
that may or may not be a spaceship,

28:23.365 --> 28:24.809
in which we may or may not get probed.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.694
- We're not gonna get probed.
- The alternatives?

28:26.719 --> 28:27.917
Yep, not too pleasant
to think about, either.

28:27.942 --> 28:29.035
That is not gonna happen, okay?

28:29.060 --> 28:30.302
Because we're gonna get out of here.

28:30.327 --> 28:31.871
How? We don't even know where "here" is.

28:31.896 --> 28:33.439
Well, this floor is
some kind of grid, right?

28:33.464 --> 28:35.113
So it's got to be connected to something.

28:36.634 --> 28:38.219
Wait.

28:38.244 --> 28:40.619
I think I can make out
some kind of shape.

28:41.673 --> 28:43.926
All right, well, maybe
that's a way out of here.

28:43.951 --> 28:46.458
Doesn't look like a w-w-w-w...

28:47.378 --> 28:48.921
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh...

28:48.946 --> 28:51.615
Sa-Sam, why can't you...

28:53.431 --> 28:54.766
Wh-Wh-Wh..

29:18.670 --> 29:20.630
It's day.

29:21.423 --> 29:23.592
This is the same place we found Kay.

29:25.740 --> 29:26.992
How you feeling?

29:27.017 --> 29:28.852
Other than a whopping headache,

29:28.877 --> 29:30.181
I don't feel experimented on.

29:30.206 --> 29:32.801
- You?
- No, same.

29:32.826 --> 29:35.703
We must have been there,
wherever there was.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.362
Well, they did something to us.

29:39.387 --> 29:41.013
I seriously couldn't speak.

29:41.038 --> 29:42.790
All right. Wait. Where are you going?

29:42.815 --> 29:44.817
Well, those lights that we saw
before we were taken

29:44.842 --> 29:46.552
came from over there.

29:46.577 --> 29:47.912
Seriously? You want to go back there?

29:47.937 --> 29:49.730
Yeah. I want to know
what the hell's going on.

29:54.469 --> 29:56.847
This is it.
We were taken right around here.

29:56.872 --> 29:58.790
No lights. No spaceship.

30:00.664 --> 30:02.833
Yeah, but what caused that?

30:04.418 --> 30:06.210
They look like craters.

30:06.211 --> 30:07.962
Or a spaceship landing.

30:11.425 --> 30:13.426
Dead birds.

30:13.427 --> 30:15.839
There's dozens of them.

30:16.054 --> 30:19.266
These birds have no sign
of any kind of impact.

30:19.291 --> 30:20.834
No burns.

30:20.859 --> 30:22.903
It's like they just fell from the sky.

30:24.539 --> 30:26.333
What else fell from the sky?

30:29.673 --> 30:32.091
So, you have a theory about all this?

30:32.092 --> 30:34.219
Yeah. Just...

30:34.220 --> 30:35.303
not willing to believe it.

30:35.304 --> 30:37.305
Me neither.

30:37.306 --> 30:40.364
In fact... I don't think it was aliens.

30:41.352 --> 30:43.436
We weren't sick. They didn't heal us.

30:43.437 --> 30:45.355
A-As far as I can tell,
they didn't do anything,

30:45.356 --> 30:46.522
so why did they take us?

30:46.523 --> 30:48.483
Maybe we were getting too close to them.

30:48.484 --> 30:50.777
So they brought us closer,
inside the ship?

30:50.778 --> 30:53.029
Why not just knock us out
and leave us in the woods?

30:53.030 --> 30:55.031
Are you trying to understand
the motivation of aliens?

30:55.032 --> 30:56.372
That's just it.

30:56.373 --> 31:00.361
I-It doesn't feel alien.
It felt human, like theater.

31:00.362 --> 31:02.321
Like we were taken
for the sake of being taken.

31:02.322 --> 31:04.532
Like someone wanted us
to think we'd been abducted.

31:04.533 --> 31:05.783
Why?

31:05.784 --> 31:07.275
Maybe to scare us away.

31:07.276 --> 31:08.661
For what?

31:10.122 --> 31:11.497
Thank God our phones are working again.

31:11.498 --> 31:12.504
Valetik.

31:12.526 --> 31:14.206
We've been trying
to reach you since last night.

31:14.231 --> 31:15.480
Where were you?

31:15.480 --> 31:16.730
It's a long story.

31:16.731 --> 31:18.355
- We have time.
- We don't.

31:18.356 --> 31:21.560
Can you check if there are any
reports or 911 calls made last night

31:21.560 --> 31:23.602
about any unusual activity
around Elk Lake?

31:23.603 --> 31:25.147
What kind of unusual activity?

31:25.148 --> 31:27.441
Whatever comes up...
Weird noises, strange lights.

31:27.442 --> 31:29.527
Strange lights? You were abducted.

31:29.528 --> 31:30.820
- No, we weren't.
- No, we weren't.

31:30.821 --> 31:31.987
- No, they weren't.
- I'm pretty sure they were.

31:31.988 --> 31:33.537
Also, see if you can find out

31:33.538 --> 31:35.699
who owns the property around Elk
Lake and what it's used for.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.535
- I'll check it out.
- Oh, wait. One more thing.

31:37.536 --> 31:39.245
C-Can you see if there's
technology out there

31:39.246 --> 31:40.626
that can scramble a person's speech?

31:40.627 --> 31:42.133
The aliens scrambled your speech?

31:42.134 --> 31:44.217
I'll see what I can dig up.

31:44.218 --> 31:47.137
Meantime, I did find a few links
between Kay, Chuck, and Arlo.

31:47.138 --> 31:48.930
Over the last couple years,
all three developed

31:48.931 --> 31:51.641
health problems involving
some form of paralysis,

31:51.642 --> 31:53.351
and they all went on disability
around the same time.

31:53.352 --> 31:55.186
- Who treated them?
- That's another link.

31:55.187 --> 31:56.938
They were all diagnosed
by the same doctor...

31:56.939 --> 31:58.356
Dr. Maria Blunt.

31:58.357 --> 31:59.524
I'll send you the address.

32:02.528 --> 32:04.288
Sure, I've heard the locals' rumors,

32:04.289 --> 32:06.894
but I don't know anything
about alien abductions.

32:06.895 --> 32:08.969
Do you know what caused
your patients to get ill

32:08.970 --> 32:10.055
all around the same time?

32:10.056 --> 32:11.671
Bad luck, I suppose,

32:11.671 --> 32:13.714
but for a while there,
I thought it was environmental.

32:13.715 --> 32:14.965
Environmental?

32:14.966 --> 32:17.801
Motor neuropathy caused by toxic exposure

32:17.802 --> 32:20.756
can sometimes masquerade
as other diseases like MS.

32:22.257 --> 32:24.134
Uh, is that treatable?

32:24.159 --> 32:26.828
It can be, if you can identify
the specific toxin

32:26.853 --> 32:28.430
the patient was exposed to.

32:29.286 --> 32:30.871
In fact, I thought it had something to do

32:30.896 --> 32:32.564
- with all those birds.
- Birds?

32:32.589 --> 32:35.634
Two years ago, hundreds of birds
dropped out of the sky.

32:35.659 --> 32:37.119
Cause was unknown.

32:37.144 --> 32:38.562
Could have been avian flu,

32:38.587 --> 32:40.037
but some of us suspected pesticides.

32:40.062 --> 32:42.731
I was trying to get the EPA
to do some testing,

32:42.756 --> 32:45.551
but then Dr. Drake showed up,
and that was that.

32:45.576 --> 32:47.741
What do you mean? He bought my
practice a few months back.

32:47.948 --> 32:49.158
I hated to give up,

32:49.183 --> 32:50.934
but he offered me twice
what it was worth.

32:50.959 --> 32:52.461
No way I could refuse that.

32:57.779 --> 33:00.854
Berto, I need you to run
background on Dr. Sheldon Drake.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.524
He owns a medical practice in Stillwater.

33:02.549 --> 33:03.883
On it.

33:03.908 --> 33:06.119
And I got some info
on the area around Elk Lake.

33:06.144 --> 33:07.894
It was state-owned
up until a few months ago.

33:07.919 --> 33:09.173
Then as a part of budget offsets,

33:09.174 --> 33:10.675
they sold a chunk of it to developers

33:10.676 --> 33:12.719
looking to build cottages on the lake.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.430
All right, thanks. Keep us posted.

33:18.702 --> 33:20.871
You really Dr. Drake has
something to do with all this?

33:20.896 --> 33:23.231
Who buys a medical practice
in a place like this

33:23.256 --> 33:24.841
for twice what it's worth?

33:24.866 --> 33:26.326
Maybe he really likes wine.

33:26.351 --> 33:28.144
Yeah, well, then he could have
set up his own practice

33:28.169 --> 33:29.254
or bought another.

33:29.279 --> 33:31.238
It's like he wanted those patients.

33:31.263 --> 33:33.058
And the timing... a few months back?

33:33.083 --> 33:35.263
That's right around the time
the Elk Lake property was sold.

33:35.286 --> 33:36.995
I don't think the timing's a coincidence.

33:36.996 --> 33:39.289
We need to follow him, see where he goes.

33:48.716 --> 33:53.520
T-T-Take m-m-me too-o-o
y-y-your le-e-e-ader.

33:53.545 --> 33:55.214
What is that?

33:55.239 --> 33:57.032
It's called speech jamming.

33:57.057 --> 33:58.767
Your own voice is projected back to you

33:58.792 --> 34:00.322
with a very slight time delay.

34:00.347 --> 34:03.475
It's so disruptive to your brain
that it renders you incoherent.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.044
So that's how the aliens did it.

34:06.029 --> 34:08.239
Let me try.

34:14.188 --> 34:16.315
Hey, M-M-Mo...

34:17.107 --> 34:19.150
I cou... cou-cou-co-co...

34:20.215 --> 34:22.175
For r-r-r-r...

34:23.793 --> 34:25.879
Freaky.

34:30.225 --> 34:31.726
What's Dr. Drake doing
at a storage building

34:31.726 --> 34:33.978
in the middle of nowhere?

34:33.978 --> 34:36.397
It's not really the kind of
place you make a house call to.

34:36.398 --> 34:40.234
Eddie. Oh, my God. No way.

34:40.235 --> 34:42.154
Wait. Do you see that?

34:43.746 --> 34:47.178
Hazmat suits, like in "E. T."
or "Close Encounters."

34:47.203 --> 34:49.696
Maybe it is aliens, and
this is a government cover-up.

34:53.034 --> 34:54.661
What do you think's inside?

34:54.686 --> 34:56.187
There's only one way to find out.

35:29.588 --> 35:31.340
Eddie?

35:31.365 --> 35:33.033
Look.

35:47.622 --> 35:49.204
So, either it sleeps standing up or...

35:49.229 --> 35:50.981
It's a costume on a mannequin.

35:51.006 --> 35:52.632
It's still creepy.

35:56.382 --> 35:59.077
These drones, high-intensity lights...

35:59.102 --> 36:01.897
everything you need
for a high-tech light show.

36:03.604 --> 36:06.147
I-I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

36:06.172 --> 36:08.174
But I was right. It was human.

36:08.199 --> 36:09.950
Yeah, but why?

36:09.975 --> 36:11.352
Maybe it is the government,

36:11.377 --> 36:12.920
and they're using
the alien story to cover up

36:12.945 --> 36:14.280
whatever is really going on.

36:35.803 --> 36:37.930
You can't be here.
This is a restricted area.

36:37.931 --> 36:39.765
Eddie, it's Chuck.

36:39.766 --> 36:42.017
This is a sterile area.
You have to get out of here.

36:42.018 --> 36:43.060
You abducted him?

36:43.061 --> 36:44.561
N... I-I didn't abduct anyone.

36:44.562 --> 36:46.396
I'm healing them.
I'm... I'm making them better.

36:46.397 --> 36:49.775
Step away. Sam, call the sheriff.

36:49.776 --> 36:52.694
Please. I'm... I'm fixing him.
That's what they want.

36:52.695 --> 36:54.237
That's why he brought me
to town, why he hired me.

36:54.238 --> 36:55.656
Why who hired you?

37:01.704 --> 37:02.937
What's going on?

37:02.962 --> 37:05.465
Just trying your world-class wine.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.617
The 2016.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.894
What is it that I'm tasting in it?

37:09.919 --> 37:12.263
I mean, there's a hint of lies
and notes of...

37:12.288 --> 37:14.415
what is that, pesticide?

37:14.440 --> 37:16.483
I think you're mistaken.
We don't use pesticides.

37:16.508 --> 37:18.427
Only you did, two years ago.

37:18.452 --> 37:20.098
We're an organic winery.

37:20.123 --> 37:21.917
You were until your vines
were threatened.

37:21.998 --> 37:24.334
And from the methyl parathion you used,

37:24.359 --> 37:26.527
we're guessing a weevil outbreak.

37:26.552 --> 37:28.788
Yeah, that's nasty stuff...
methyl parathion.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.439
Especially if you don't know
what you're doing.

37:30.464 --> 37:32.883
One little spill can do
a lot of damage to humans,

37:32.908 --> 37:34.201
not to mention birds.

37:34.226 --> 37:35.603
No, I... I never...

37:35.628 --> 37:37.713
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

37:37.738 --> 37:39.657
And then you panicked

37:39.682 --> 37:41.142
and buried the evidence on state land

37:41.167 --> 37:43.034
where you thought no one would find it.

37:43.059 --> 37:45.228
And the state sold the land.
They were gonna develop it.

37:45.253 --> 37:46.754
They were gonna dig up everything

37:46.779 --> 37:48.406
and find out what you did.

37:48.431 --> 37:50.877
See these people?
They did seasonal work for you.

37:51.413 --> 37:52.664
They remember the leaking barrels.

37:52.689 --> 37:54.066
They remember
walking through those puddles

37:54.091 --> 37:56.176
that you claimed was just
harmless liquid fertilizer.

37:56.201 --> 37:57.786
You lied to us.

37:57.832 --> 37:59.667
Didn't tell us we'd been exposed.

37:59.692 --> 38:01.110
You thought it would all blow over,

38:01.135 --> 38:03.054
but then we started getting sick.

38:03.099 --> 38:05.717
You knew we could sue you
for everything you were worth,

38:05.742 --> 38:07.911
so you used those stories from '72

38:07.936 --> 38:09.562
to fix the damage you'd done.

38:09.587 --> 38:11.100
Guys, this... this is ridiculous.

38:11.125 --> 38:12.413
None of this is true.

38:12.438 --> 38:14.293
Dr. Drake told us everything...

38:14.318 --> 38:15.944
how you paid him a fortune
to treat their neuropathy

38:15.969 --> 38:17.471
without letting them know the cause.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.956
The lights we saw in the woods,
the hazmat team?

38:19.981 --> 38:21.483
That was you digging up the barrels

38:21.508 --> 38:23.009
trying to get rid of them again.

38:26.631 --> 38:27.882
Hello, Wes.

38:35.857 --> 38:38.192
Deputies found your spaceship.

38:38.217 --> 38:39.802
It was staged in an old grain elevator

38:39.827 --> 38:41.478
in the back part of Wes's property.

38:41.503 --> 38:43.547
I still can't believe what
he was able to get away with.

38:43.572 --> 38:45.491
Wes has deep pockets.

38:45.516 --> 38:48.560
Winery's his hobby,
but he made a fortune in tech,

38:48.585 --> 38:50.086
including, by the way,

38:50.111 --> 38:52.322
developing strobe-light weapons
for the military

38:52.347 --> 38:54.099
designed to incapacitate the enemy.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.297
So that's how he did it.

38:55.322 --> 38:57.688
I guess he figured it was better
to spend a million on his hoax

38:57.713 --> 38:59.881
rather than lose hundreds
of millions in settlements.

38:59.906 --> 39:01.241
Well, it was kind of genius

39:01.266 --> 39:03.814
using Stillwater's
healing-alien story as cover.

39:03.839 --> 39:05.174
I mean, the lie was so big,

39:05.199 --> 39:07.034
it was almost impossible
not to believe it.

39:07.059 --> 39:10.039
Well, all the folks here
wanted it to be real.

39:10.498 --> 39:13.584
Hell, I did, too, and that's why
they didn't want you poking around.

39:13.609 --> 39:15.003
Oh, I understand. They thought
they had something

39:15.004 --> 39:16.964
that made Stillwater special
and didn't want to share it.

39:16.965 --> 39:18.776
Oh, Stillwater is special.

39:18.801 --> 39:21.971
Just not like that, it turns out.

39:21.996 --> 39:24.957
Thank you both for getting
to the bottom of this.

39:31.060 --> 39:34.272
So, turns out
it wasn't aliens in Stillwater.

39:34.297 --> 39:35.757
Not this time,
but they still haven't found out

39:35.782 --> 39:37.234
what happened in '72.

39:37.259 --> 39:40.011
You really think Josiah Carberry
was cured by extraterrestrials?

39:40.036 --> 39:41.913
I don't think it's beyond
the realm of possibility.

39:44.026 --> 39:45.862
You never told me
about your close encounter.

39:45.887 --> 39:47.555
I don't think you'd understand.

39:48.004 --> 39:50.663
Try me. I might surprise me.

39:51.105 --> 39:53.190
You'll probably mask your discomfort

39:53.215 --> 39:55.752
with the unknown by making
dismissive comments,

39:56.301 --> 40:00.048
but, suffice it to say,
I was touched by an alien.

40:00.073 --> 40:01.950
Physically touched?

40:01.975 --> 40:04.978
And ever since, I've had
the ability to read minds.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.297
Okay.

40:07.322 --> 40:08.598
So what am I thinking?

40:09.425 --> 40:11.218
You're thinking...

40:11.243 --> 40:12.286
"She can't read minds,

40:12.311 --> 40:15.272
but if she can, I'm in big trouble."

40:15.596 --> 40:16.931
Oh, my God.

40:18.641 --> 40:19.809
Oh, my God.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.336
I'm just kidding.

40:21.361 --> 40:22.737
I did see a UFO once,

40:22.762 --> 40:24.739
but it didn't give me
the power to read minds.

40:24.888 --> 40:27.288
However, I can usually tell
what you're thinking.

40:29.106 --> 40:31.579
I'm a psych student.
I don't have to read minds.

40:31.611 --> 40:33.196
I read behavior.

40:36.472 --> 40:37.961
We should play poker sometime.

40:38.667 --> 40:40.338
No, not strip poker.

40:44.826 --> 40:46.661
So, Wes McManus's wines...

40:47.006 --> 40:48.466
not so swift.

40:48.491 --> 40:49.826
Oh, wow. Really?

40:49.851 --> 40:50.977
How long have you been waiting
to say that?

40:51.002 --> 40:53.379
- Pretty much all day.
- Yeah.

40:53.404 --> 40:54.781
And, you know,
I'm actually kind of bummed

40:54.806 --> 40:56.849
that there were no real aliens.

40:57.404 --> 40:58.989
Me too.

40:59.585 --> 41:01.671
Really? I was expecting you
to say, "I told you so."

41:01.696 --> 41:04.073
From the guy who actually
thought he saw an alien?

41:04.495 --> 41:06.080
Besides, I kind of like

41:06.105 --> 41:08.899
thinking that there is
something else out there,

41:08.924 --> 41:10.009
something more.

41:13.562 --> 41:15.398
Uh... Sam?

41:17.089 --> 41:19.341
I took it from Wes's warehouse.

41:19.366 --> 41:21.618
I got ya. You totally
thought it was aliens.

41:21.643 --> 41:23.354
- Hmm. Not so swift.
- Ah!
