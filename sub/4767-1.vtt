03:03.658 --> 03:06.369
Snuggle in, sweetie! It's cold out there.

03:11.249 --> 03:14.586
Why is it snowing, Grandma?
Where does it come from?

03:15.170 --> 03:17.589
Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.

03:18.548 --> 03:21.759
- I wanna hear.
- Not tonight. Go to sleep.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.763
I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.

03:26.264 --> 03:28.349
Well, all right.

03:29.434 --> 03:31.519
Let's see...

03:32.061 --> 03:35.857
I guess it would have to start with scissors!

03:35.940 --> 03:38.026
Scissors?

03:38.109 --> 03:41.780
Well, there are all kinds of scissors.

03:42.822 --> 03:47.660
And once there was even a man
who had scissors for hands.

03:47.744 --> 03:49.704
- A man?
- Yes.

03:49.788 --> 03:53.541
- Hands scissors?
- No, scissor hands.

03:54.793 --> 03:59.380
You know the mansion
on top of the mountain?

03:59.923 --> 04:01.591
It's haunted.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.760
Well...

04:04.385 --> 04:06.471
A long time ago

04:07.972 --> 04:10.642
an inventor lived in that mansion.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.938
He made many things, I suppose.

04:20.985 --> 04:23.071
<i>He also created a man.</i>

04:24.781 --> 04:30.745
<i>He gave him insides,</i>
<i>a heart, a brain, everything.</i>

04:31.913 --> 04:33.998
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

04:36.417 --> 04:40.296
<i>You see, the inventor was very old.</i>

04:40.380 --> 04:43.883
<i>He died before he got to finish</i>
<i>the man he invented.</i>

04:45.343 --> 04:48.138
<i>So the man was left by himself,</i>

04:48.888 --> 04:52.308
<i>incomplete and all alone.</i>

04:53.935 --> 04:56.020
<i>He didn't have a name?</i>

04:56.729 --> 04:58.815
<i>Of course he had a name.</i>

04:59.607 --> 05:01.693
<i>His name was Edward.</i>

05:48.239 --> 05:50.116
Avon calling!

05:50.200 --> 05:53.536
- Weren't you just here?
- No, not since last season!

05:54.078 --> 05:59.042
Today I've come to show you our exquisite
new line of softer colours, in shadows,

05:59.125 --> 06:00.877
blushes and lipstick.

06:00.960 --> 06:04.672
Everything you need to accent and highlight
your changing look.

06:04.756 --> 06:08.092
My changing look. That's good!

06:08.176 --> 06:11.679
I also have a complete selection
of your old favourites,

06:11.763 --> 06:16.184
those tried and true products we've all
come to depend on year in and year out.

06:16.267 --> 06:18.853
Come on, Peg,
I never buy anything from you.

06:18.937 --> 06:21.064
I know. Bye, Helen.

06:22.148 --> 06:26.319
You didn't have to call me, ma'am.
You could have taken care of this by yourself.

06:26.402 --> 06:28.488
I could? I don't think so.

06:28.571 --> 06:31.366
It's easy. Your food trap's clogged, that's all.

06:31.449 --> 06:33.910
See this bolt here? You just unscrew this...

06:35.703 --> 06:37.455
And out she pops.

06:37.539 --> 06:40.083
On TV they say you repairmen
are a lonely bunch.

06:40.166 --> 06:44.921
Housewives get lonely too, though you may
not realise it since they haven't made an ad.

06:45.004 --> 06:50.927
And then you just take this and put it back in
here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it.

06:51.010 --> 06:53.263
And then you just screw this back on.

06:54.556 --> 06:57.016
Now who could that be?

06:57.100 --> 06:59.185
Will you excuse me for a moment?

06:59.894 --> 07:04.023
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
This is fascinatin'!

07:04.107 --> 07:06.526
I wouldn't wanna miss a moment of it!

07:11.197 --> 07:14.409
- Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling!
- Why, Peg...

07:14.492 --> 07:17.704
Have you gone blind?
Can't you see that vehicle in my drive?

07:20.832 --> 07:24.043
- Yes.
- Don't you realise that means I'm busy?

07:25.795 --> 07:28.339
OK, now we should decide on lipsticks.

07:28.423 --> 07:33.094
OK, dear, did you like the Winsome Wahini,
which looked charming on you,

07:33.178 --> 07:35.597
or the Bahimini Bliss?

07:35.680 --> 07:37.766
- I like 'em both.
- Well, great!

07:38.850 --> 07:42.020
You don't actually think
I have any money, do you?

07:54.282 --> 07:57.702
Ding-dong! The Avon lady!

08:00.747 --> 08:02.624
Just not my day.

09:59.491 --> 10:01.576
Oh, my goodness!

10:20.762 --> 10:23.264
Oh, it's so beautiful!

10:45.078 --> 10:47.163
Hello?

11:13.982 --> 11:16.067
Hello?

11:23.616 --> 11:26.369
Hello? Avon calling!

12:01.613 --> 12:03.698
Oh, my!

12:06.242 --> 12:08.328
Hello?

12:12.874 --> 12:18.338
I'm Peg Boggs.
I'm your local Avon representative.

12:29.974 --> 12:34.771
I'm sorry to barge in like this,
but you don't have any reason to be afraid.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.982
This is some huge house, isn't it?

12:38.066 --> 12:41.820
Thank goodness
for those aerobics classes.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.252
Hello?

13:40.295 --> 13:42.630
Why are you hiding back there?

13:46.092 --> 13:49.345
You don't have to hide from me.
I'm Peg Boggs.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.848
I'm your local Avon representative,

13:51.931 --> 13:55.018
and I'm as harmless as cherry pie...

13:55.101 --> 13:56.436
Oh, my!

13:56.519 --> 13:59.063
I can see that I've disturbed you.

13:59.147 --> 14:01.357
How stupid of me. I'll just be going now.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.526
Don't go.

14:09.824 --> 14:11.910
Oh, my!

14:12.869 --> 14:14.913
What happened to you?

14:14.996 --> 14:17.040
I'm not finished.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.751
Put those down.
Don't come any closer. Please...

14:27.509 --> 14:29.594
Those are your hands?

14:36.976 --> 14:39.062
What happened to you?

14:41.523 --> 14:43.608
Where are your parents?

14:44.526 --> 14:46.611
Your mother?

14:47.654 --> 14:49.948
Your father?

14:50.573 --> 14:52.242
He didn't wake up.

14:56.830 --> 15:00.750
Are you alone?
Do you live up here all by yourself?

15:04.921 --> 15:07.006
What happened to your face?

15:10.677 --> 15:13.138
I won't hurt you.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.976
At the very least,
let me give you a good astringent.

15:18.059 --> 15:20.478
This will help to prevent infection.

15:31.948 --> 15:34.033
What's your name?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.453
Edward.

15:41.916 --> 15:44.544
I think you should just come home with me.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.978
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.357
You go ahead and look.
You have every reason to be excited.

16:11.696 --> 16:13.782
You OK?

16:45.480 --> 16:46.689
Hello?

16:46.773 --> 16:48.399
Hi. It's Marge.

16:48.483 --> 16:53.404
I was standing outside talking to Carol, and
Peg drove by. She had somebody with her.

16:53.488 --> 16:56.241
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No, I didn't.

16:56.324 --> 16:58.952
Did she say anything to you
about having a guest?

16:59.035 --> 17:02.372
Nothing at all.
She rang my doorbell at the crack of dawn.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.415
No... OK, I'll meet you on the corner.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.585
Right. Bye.

17:12.257 --> 17:13.383
Damn!

17:26.146 --> 17:28.272
Here we go, dear. This is our house.

17:28.356 --> 17:31.985
You can just go right in
and make yourself right at home, OK?

17:32.068 --> 17:35.405
We'll have something to eat or drink, or...

17:35.488 --> 17:40.368
Here, dear. Here we go. This is the front door.
Right in here.

17:40.452 --> 17:44.747
Joyce? I just saw this strange guy
drive in with Peg. I didn't get a good look.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.666
He looked kinda pale.

17:46.749 --> 17:49.043
On my way. Don't do anything without me.

17:49.127 --> 17:51.212
Yes! Be right there!

17:57.093 --> 17:59.179
Here we are.

18:17.614 --> 18:22.368
So... this is the living room
and back here are the bedrooms.

18:22.452 --> 18:24.996
You want to see the pictures? All right.

18:26.122 --> 18:30.543
This is my husband Bill.
He's a bowling champion.

18:30.627 --> 18:32.962
Do you know what bowling is?

18:33.046 --> 18:34.881
Bowling?

18:34.964 --> 18:37.884
No. Well... Here they are
down at the lake, fishing.

18:37.967 --> 18:43.098
I think Kevin looks a little glum
because they didn't catch anything that day.

18:43.973 --> 18:47.644
And here's my daughter Kim.

18:48.269 --> 18:50.355
All dressed for the junior prom.

18:58.696 --> 19:01.324
She's a senior now, if you can believe it!

19:02.075 --> 19:04.953
She's camping in the mountains
with friends,

19:05.036 --> 19:07.956
but she'll be back in a few days.
You can meet then.

19:17.382 --> 19:19.467
Isn't she beautiful?

19:27.308 --> 19:29.394
That's my family.

19:30.228 --> 19:32.981
Come along.
I'll show you the rest of the house.

19:33.064 --> 19:35.900
Then you can just freshen up
and make yourself at home.

19:35.984 --> 19:39.904
That's the kitchen over there.
Help yourself to anything you want.

19:39.988 --> 19:43.491
Those are grapes.
And back here are the bedrooms.

19:43.575 --> 19:47.454
Let me get you some towels
and I'll see what we can find for you to wear.

19:47.537 --> 19:52.667
You know what? I think I have some of
Bill's old clothes in here. This is perfect!

19:53.585 --> 19:55.670
Here. These should just fit you.

19:57.046 --> 19:59.382
Don't be alarmed. That's just the phone.

19:59.466 --> 20:03.928
Now you can go in Kim's room
and put these on, and I'll be right with you.

21:49.534 --> 21:52.787
No, no, scissors!

21:52.871 --> 21:56.958
That's right. Well, he was
born up there or... something.

21:57.041 --> 22:01.045
- <i>Have you seen him before?</i>
- No, I doubt he's ever been off the grounds.

22:01.129 --> 22:03.923
<i>Then how did you ever get together with him?</i>

22:04.007 --> 22:08.136
Listen, I have to go now.
I'll talk to you later, Marge. Bye-bye.

22:18.146 --> 22:20.231
Sorry, Edward, I didn't...

22:21.232 --> 22:23.151
May I help you with this?

22:23.234 --> 22:25.320
Thank you.

22:27.989 --> 22:31.576
There you go. Oh dear, you've cut your face.

22:31.659 --> 22:33.620
Let me just get this right off.

22:33.703 --> 22:35.705
- Does that hurt?
- No.

22:35.789 --> 22:38.208
Good. OK. Now, let's get you dressed.

22:42.086 --> 22:45.215
There we go. Very fine!

22:49.761 --> 22:51.846
You look fine!

22:57.060 --> 22:59.771
Helen, come on! She wouldn't wait for you.

23:00.688 --> 23:02.774
I've got rollers in my damn hair!

23:23.002 --> 23:26.089
Now, what did I do with my sciss...?

23:27.132 --> 23:29.634
Edward, would you?

23:31.302 --> 23:32.929
Thank you.

23:33.555 --> 23:37.100
You know, I have a doctor friend
who I think could help you.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.686
- Really?
- Yes.

23:40.645 --> 23:42.730
Now, I can help with the scars...

23:45.817 --> 23:50.405
But I just wanna consult the big
Avon handbook before doing anything.

24:34.866 --> 24:36.951
Kevin!

24:41.289 --> 24:43.374
It's not polite to stare, dear.

24:46.127 --> 24:50.256
Think how it would make you feel
if somebody were staring at you.

24:50.381 --> 24:54.511
- I wouldn't care.
- Well, I would, so don't do it!

24:54.594 --> 24:58.139
This must be quite a change
for you, right, Ed?

24:58.223 --> 25:01.643
- Edward, dear. I think he prefers Edward.
- Sure.

25:02.393 --> 25:07.065
So what have you been doin' with yourself
up there in that big old place?

25:07.148 --> 25:10.902
- I bet the view must be spectacular, huh, Ed?
- Edward!

25:11.569 --> 25:12.612
Yes?

25:13.988 --> 25:16.282
No, I just...

25:16.366 --> 25:19.202
See all the way to the ocean, I bet.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.121
Sometimes.

25:22.705 --> 25:25.750
Bill, could I have the salt and pepper, please?

25:27.418 --> 25:31.714
Bill, dear, could I have
the salt and pepper, please? Thank you.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.402
Man, those things are cool!

25:52.902 --> 25:56.448
I bet they're razor-sharp.
One karate chop to a guy's neck...

25:56.531 --> 25:57.991
Kevin...!

26:01.494 --> 26:02.954
Edward,

26:03.455 --> 26:06.332
would you like some butter for your bread?

26:10.920 --> 26:12.589
Great!

26:13.006 --> 26:15.091
Thank you.

26:17.510 --> 26:20.180
Hey, can I bring him to
show and tell on Monday?

26:20.263 --> 26:22.307
Kevin, I've had enough.

26:27.103 --> 26:29.147
Do you think you can sleep?

26:29.230 --> 26:32.650
I know things feel strange,
but soon you'll feel right at home.

26:33.526 --> 26:35.612
Good night.

27:36.923 --> 27:39.884
The light concealing cream goes on first,

27:40.385 --> 27:42.637
then you blend and blend and blend.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.681
Blending is the secret.

27:47.559 --> 27:49.310
More concealing cream...

27:49.394 --> 27:52.021
Your complexion is so fair!

27:52.105 --> 27:54.649
Now, this has a touch of lavender in it.

27:55.567 --> 27:57.444
Give it a try here.

27:57.527 --> 27:59.821
Close enough!

27:59.904 --> 28:02.407
OK, this should do the trick here.

28:08.580 --> 28:10.665
I have another idea.

28:11.458 --> 28:15.879
We'll cover up the scars
and start with a completely smooth surface.

28:29.726 --> 28:31.811
Darn this stuff!

28:41.446 --> 28:45.366
<i>They still have 11 on the scoreboard,</i>
<i>and it's three to one.</i>

28:47.869 --> 28:49.662
<i>It's through the gap to Warren.</i>

28:53.792 --> 28:55.710
<i>Now they change it to 12 hits.</i>

28:55.794 --> 28:57.962
Turn it up, Kevin, I can't hear it!

29:00.799 --> 29:02.550
Kevin!

29:04.636 --> 29:07.388
- <i>It's hammered!</i>
- Did you hear that, Mr Boggs?

29:07.472 --> 29:09.849
- No, make it louder!
- <i>It's gone,</i>

29:09.933 --> 29:12.018
<i>it's out of here, it's history!</i>

29:17.440 --> 29:18.983
Dad...

29:19.067 --> 29:20.777
Look!

29:20.860 --> 29:24.155
<i>... to make it a five-run inning</i>
<i>and blow this game to pieces!</i>

29:24.239 --> 29:26.074
I'll be darned.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.050
They filled the whole tape!

29:44.134 --> 29:47.220
<i>What's going on over there, Peg? Call me.</i>

29:47.303 --> 29:50.432
<i>Hi, it's Marge. Who is he? Call me.</i>

29:50.515 --> 29:54.936
<i>Oh, by the way, I hear it's pouring rain in</i>
<i>the mountains. Do you think the kids are OK?</i>

29:55.019 --> 29:59.899
<i>Hey there, darlin'! The gals are all in a tizzy</i>
<i>about your secret visitor.</i>

29:59.983 --> 30:02.527
<i>You can't keep him a secret for ever!</i>

30:16.624 --> 30:21.880
Well, it's just wonderful, Ed. My God,
you have the whole family in there, don't ya?

30:21.963 --> 30:26.050
<i>And he answers the challenge at first</i>
<i>with a strike of his own.</i>

30:27.469 --> 30:29.554
Edward, come here.

30:37.479 --> 30:39.731
No, that's a terrible idea, son!

30:39.814 --> 30:43.693
Go to the garage and get the oil can.
We don't want him rusting up on us.

30:51.242 --> 30:53.578
Edward, you did us!

30:54.245 --> 30:56.581
- Oh, Bill, it's us!
- Yes, it is.

30:59.959 --> 31:04.631
It's not heaven he's from,
it's straight from the stinking flames of hell.

31:04.714 --> 31:07.258
The power of Satan is in him, I can feel it.

31:07.342 --> 31:10.804
- Can't you? Have you sheep strayed so far?
- We're not sheep.

31:10.887 --> 31:12.972
Don't come near me.

31:16.559 --> 31:19.687
That's right. Go on, get outta here, run!

31:19.771 --> 31:22.148
Edward, don't you listen to her!

31:22.232 --> 31:26.611
Don't worry about her, Edward.
She's just a little loony, that's all.

31:32.408 --> 31:33.868
Hi!

31:33.952 --> 31:36.871
You-all are hidin' in there like hermit crabs.

31:36.955 --> 31:38.790
Hi, Joyce.

31:38.873 --> 31:41.960
Shame on you,
keepin' your unusual guest to yourself.

31:42.043 --> 31:44.337
We think that's mighty selfish of you.

31:44.421 --> 31:46.089
Things have been hectic here.

31:46.172 --> 31:49.259
That is so sweet of you
to wanna correct the situation.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.219
What time <i>does</i> the barbecue begin?

31:51.302 --> 31:52.762
Barbecue?

31:52.846 --> 31:55.723
You intend to introduce
your guest to your friends,

31:55.807 --> 31:57.892
- don't you?
- I'll bring coleslaw.

31:59.811 --> 32:02.272
And I will bring the ambrosia salad!

32:03.231 --> 32:06.151
What time was it that you said?

32:06.234 --> 32:08.319
- Bill!
- About five?

32:09.904 --> 32:12.240
He has been sent first to tempt you!

32:12.991 --> 32:18.329
But it's not too late.
You must push him from you, expel him.

32:18.413 --> 32:20.874
Trample down the perversion of nature.

32:21.416 --> 32:24.711
Did you hear that?
He's a perversion of nature.

32:24.794 --> 32:26.796
Why, isn't that excitin'?

32:30.842 --> 32:32.927
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks so much.

32:36.514 --> 32:38.600
Bill!

32:41.436 --> 32:45.273
You really can't have a picnic or a barbecue
without devilled eggs.

32:45.356 --> 32:48.568
They're just the best. They make a thing.

32:48.651 --> 32:53.448
Oh, Edward, that's wonderful!
I didn't know you'd chopped the whole thing.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.869
All right now, it's just a nick.

32:57.952 --> 33:00.663
There's no need to be nervous, dear.

33:00.747 --> 33:06.252
Esmeralda won't be here. And the rest of
the neighbours, they're really very nice.

33:06.336 --> 33:09.714
There's no need to be nervous.
They're so eager to meet you!

33:09.798 --> 33:11.633
You just have to be yourself.

33:11.716 --> 33:15.345
- Myself?
- That's right. Just your own sweet self.

35:41.741 --> 35:45.328
- Thanks, Edward.
- Hey! Play scissors, paper, stone with us.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.622
Play scissors what?

35:47.705 --> 35:50.583
I got a doctor friend
might be able to help you.

35:51.459 --> 35:55.547
- He did them just like that!
- That is incredible.

35:55.630 --> 35:58.174
- Hi, Mike, how you doin'?
- Hello, Jack.

35:58.925 --> 36:00.677
Hey, kids!

36:00.760 --> 36:04.973
Hi, George Monroe. That's a heck of
a handshake you got there, Ed.

36:05.056 --> 36:08.101
Harry! I saw you
on the golf course last week...

36:10.728 --> 36:14.315
Are you OK? Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry?

36:15.859 --> 36:17.402
Do you want a cracker?

36:17.485 --> 36:19.946
- He's different.
- Completely different.

36:20.029 --> 36:21.865
No kidding.

36:21.948 --> 36:24.033
- He's so...
- Mysterious.

36:25.577 --> 36:29.456
D'you imagine those hands are hot or cold?

36:29.539 --> 36:32.292
And just think what a single snip could do.

36:32.375 --> 36:34.169
Or undo.

36:36.087 --> 36:37.672
Eddie.

36:37.756 --> 36:41.176
The guys and I want to invite you
to our card game Friday night.

36:41.259 --> 36:43.052
Would you like that?

36:43.136 --> 36:45.221
Only thing is... you can't cut!

36:58.359 --> 37:02.947
I have my own infirmity.
Never did me a bit of harm.

37:03.031 --> 37:08.787
Took some shrapnel during the war,
and ever since then I can't feel a damn thing!

37:08.870 --> 37:12.248
Don't you ever let anybody tell you
you have a handicap.

37:12.332 --> 37:15.543
Who's handicapped? My goodness.

37:16.336 --> 37:20.131
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not handicapped, you're...

37:20.215 --> 37:23.134
What do they call the... exceptional?

37:24.552 --> 37:29.724
My name's Joyce, and I noticed that you
have not tasted any of the ambrosia salad

37:29.808 --> 37:32.185
that I made especially for you.

37:33.019 --> 37:35.105
Allow me.

37:43.071 --> 37:47.617
- You must try this. It's my mother's recipe.
- Doesn't this look gorgeous?

37:47.700 --> 37:52.247
With a green thumb like yours,
I sure could use your help at my place.

37:53.581 --> 37:55.333
I want a row of angels!

37:55.416 --> 38:00.964
I am so sorry, ladies, but he's promised to
come to my house first. Haven't you, Eddie?

38:01.047 --> 38:04.467
- I did?
- OK, everybody, grab your plates!

38:04.551 --> 38:06.344
Soup's on!

38:08.471 --> 38:10.640
What?

38:10.723 --> 38:13.226
It <i>is</i> shish kebab. It was a figure of speech.

38:13.309 --> 38:15.770
You shouldn't take things so literally.

38:19.065 --> 38:23.736
<i>"Let us pretend we are in the drawing</i>
<i>room and the hostess is serving tea."</i>

38:25.572 --> 38:28.700
"Many numerous little questions
confront us."

38:31.369 --> 38:34.706
"Should the man rise
when he accepts his cup of tea?"

38:36.541 --> 38:39.669
"May lump sugar be taken with the fingers?"

38:39.753 --> 38:41.004
No.

38:41.087 --> 38:43.923
"Is it good form to accept a second cup?"

38:45.133 --> 38:48.386
"Should the napkin be entirely unfolded,

38:48.470 --> 38:51.723
or should the centre crease
be allowed to remain?"

38:51.806 --> 38:54.684
"It is so easy to commit
embarrassing blunders,

38:54.768 --> 38:58.396
but etiquette tells us
just what is expected of us

38:58.480 --> 39:02.358
and guards us from all
humiliation and discomfort."

39:09.616 --> 39:11.951
Yes. Boring.

39:12.035 --> 39:14.120
Let us switch to...

39:15.079 --> 39:17.165
To some poetry, hm?

39:21.628 --> 39:24.130
"There was an old man from the Cape,"

39:24.214 --> 39:26.758
"Who made himself garments of crepe."

39:26.841 --> 39:28.968
"When asked: Will they tear?"

39:29.052 --> 39:31.179
"He replied: Here and there,"

39:31.262 --> 39:33.765
"But they keep such a beautiful shape!"

39:35.975 --> 39:37.727
That's right.

39:37.811 --> 39:40.188
Go ahead, smile. It's funny.

40:04.170 --> 40:05.630
We're home.

40:05.713 --> 40:07.549
Shit.

40:07.632 --> 40:09.467
Everything's still sopping.

40:09.551 --> 40:13.054
- I can hardly wait to take a shower.
- And to sleep in a bed.

40:13.138 --> 40:16.015
If my parents have the alarm set,
I'm screwed.

40:16.099 --> 40:19.644
I told you to call them
and tell them we're coming back early.

40:19.727 --> 40:22.313
- But did you?
- Nope, he'd rather complain.

40:22.397 --> 40:24.566
How else am I supposed to get attention?

40:24.649 --> 40:28.695
- You didn't call your parents.
- They don't run things like a police state.

40:28.778 --> 40:31.406
Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny.

40:32.073 --> 40:33.199
Bye.

40:33.283 --> 40:35.410
- Don't forget your arm!
- Oh, yeah.

40:35.493 --> 40:37.579
Come on, Jim, let's go.

41:36.471 --> 41:40.350
There's somebody in my room! Go look!

41:40.433 --> 41:43.770
He's a murderer! He's got an axe!
He tried to kill me!

41:43.853 --> 41:46.147
Everything's OK.

41:46.231 --> 41:48.316
Go back to bed, Kevin.

41:53.196 --> 41:55.448
This way.

41:55.532 --> 42:00.120
Edward's come to live with us.
There is nothing to be upset about.

42:01.955 --> 42:04.749
We'll have you set up here in a minute.

42:04.833 --> 42:08.169
We got a full queen-size bed here,
believe it or not.

42:09.754 --> 42:12.632
It's all made and everything. Good.

42:12.715 --> 42:14.426
There you go.

42:14.509 --> 42:16.553
What's the matter? What's wrong?

42:16.636 --> 42:18.721
She get you nervous?

42:19.556 --> 42:22.725
You've been cloistered away
up in that castle too long.

42:22.809 --> 42:27.856
You don't know about the wonderful world
of teenage girls. They're all crazy.

42:28.773 --> 42:32.444
- Here, this'll straighten you right out.
- What is it?

42:32.527 --> 42:34.612
Lemonade.

42:40.785 --> 42:42.579
I don't know what it is.

42:43.621 --> 42:45.707
They reach a certain age...

42:46.249 --> 42:50.044
They develop these gland things,
their bodies swell up...

42:50.795 --> 42:52.464
They go crazy.

42:55.592 --> 42:56.926
Glands?

42:58.011 --> 43:00.096
Yeah, glands.

43:00.722 --> 43:02.807
I try not to think about it.

43:20.658 --> 43:23.244
Good, isn't it?

43:23.787 --> 43:28.416
Now, you stay in Kevin's room tonight
and tomorrow we'll fix your room right up.

43:28.500 --> 43:30.335
Why did you have to bring him here?

43:30.418 --> 43:33.797
I couldn't have left him all alone.
You'd have done the same.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.757
Why does he have to stay <i>here?</i>

43:35.840 --> 43:39.594
My goodness, Kim, I'm surprised at you.
He can't help the way he is.

43:39.677 --> 43:42.931
- Have a little sympathy.
- I do have sympathy.

43:43.014 --> 43:46.976
Then say a little greeting.
Come downstairs, shake the man's hand...

43:47.060 --> 43:49.813
- Shake his hand?!
- Well, not literally.

43:49.896 --> 43:54.025
- Goodness, you scared him half to death!
- I scared <i>him</i> to death?

43:59.114 --> 44:04.786
Hi, Bill! I just wanted you two
to have a proper introduction.

44:04.869 --> 44:07.038
Edward, this is our daughter Kim.

44:07.163 --> 44:10.583
Kim, this is Edward,
who's gonna live with us.

44:16.589 --> 44:17.841
Hi.

44:31.980 --> 44:33.773
Eddie!

44:33.857 --> 44:35.650
Thirsty?

44:39.070 --> 44:41.156
Kisses! Hush up!

44:43.074 --> 44:45.285
Quiet now!

44:45.368 --> 44:51.040
Darlin', I can hardly hear myself think!
Momma's precious little baby girl...

44:54.878 --> 44:58.381
Wouldn't you like
a nice cool glass of lemonade?

44:59.048 --> 45:00.592
Lemonade?

45:10.185 --> 45:13.104
One chop to a guy's neck, and it's all over.

45:15.064 --> 45:18.485
Sharpest things in the world.
They can hack through anything.

45:19.360 --> 45:20.779
And...

45:38.880 --> 45:40.673
They give me the creeps.

45:40.757 --> 45:43.802
You should see the clown
in Miss Peters' yard.

45:44.511 --> 45:45.804
Kim!

45:46.846 --> 45:49.057
- Oh, no.
- That's him?

45:49.140 --> 45:51.351
- He's calling you, Kimba.
- Stop it!

45:51.434 --> 45:54.145
Edward, you forgot your cookies.

45:56.731 --> 45:59.234
Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for ya!

45:59.317 --> 46:01.736
- Stop!
- Let's go.

46:08.243 --> 46:10.703
Bill, Edward had lunch at Jackie's today

46:10.787 --> 46:13.832
and she just had her kitchen
completely redone.

46:13.915 --> 46:17.168
- I'll be darned.
- New paint, new cabinets, new floors,

46:17.252 --> 46:21.131
- a new microwave, new silent dishwasher...
- Isn't that wonderful?

46:21.214 --> 46:24.551
Jim, didn't you just tell me
your mom had her kitchen done too?

46:24.634 --> 46:27.220
Yeah, my dad bought himself
a bunch of new toys.

46:27.303 --> 46:30.807
Big-screen TV, CD players,
VCR with four heads...

46:30.890 --> 46:35.145
My goodness sake!
I wonder what it's like to be that rich.

46:35.895 --> 46:37.814
They keep things locked up.

46:37.897 --> 46:41.317
My father has his own room for his stuff
to make sure I can't use it.

46:41.401 --> 46:43.319
He won't even help me buy an old car.

46:43.403 --> 46:48.575
He probably wants you to pay for it yourself.
It builds character. You'll appreciate it more.

46:48.658 --> 46:50.118
Dad...!

46:50.201 --> 46:55.039
Speaking of money... I understand you're
not charging for your gardening, Edward.

46:55.123 --> 46:58.084
Now, Bill... Marge made him cookies today.

46:58.168 --> 47:00.253
Sweetheart...

47:01.129 --> 47:04.466
You can't buy
the necessities of life with cookies.

47:05.467 --> 47:08.303
You can't buy a car with cookies.
Am I right, Jim?

47:08.386 --> 47:10.513
That's true, sir, you can't.

47:12.015 --> 47:14.976
I can't eat that. He used his hands.

47:15.059 --> 47:17.479
I don't think it's sanitary.

47:22.275 --> 47:24.694
I'm sorry.

47:27.864 --> 47:30.742
Honey, you want me
to help you clean that up?

47:30.825 --> 47:32.744
No, that's OK.

47:33.453 --> 47:35.580
I'll be right back.

48:22.127 --> 48:27.132
Alexis? Oh, this can't possibly be my Alexis!

48:27.799 --> 48:31.970
She looks so beautiful! Look at you! Sweetie!

48:32.762 --> 48:34.848
She's gorgeous. Thank you!

48:36.724 --> 48:39.811
It won't be long.
She just has to decide on the style.

48:39.894 --> 48:41.980
And then it'll be fine.

48:53.324 --> 48:57.537
I was hopin' for somethin' big
and kinda bouffant. Kinda like mine?

48:57.620 --> 49:02.542
Now don't you worry, Kisses, you're gonna
be just fine. You're gonna be so pretty.

49:02.625 --> 49:04.335
Yes, you are.

49:20.769 --> 49:23.938
Oh! Eddie, is there anything you can't do?

49:24.022 --> 49:28.026
You take my very breath away, I swear.
Look at this!

49:29.611 --> 49:31.488
Have you ever cut a woman's hair?

49:31.571 --> 49:33.364
Would you cut mine?

50:41.224 --> 50:45.353
That was the single most thrillin' experience
of my whole life.

51:50.335 --> 51:52.670
They're getting the head of the company!

51:52.754 --> 51:56.007
- I'm home!
- Hi, honey. We're in here.

51:56.091 --> 51:58.009
Hi.

51:58.093 --> 51:59.886
What did you do to your hair?

51:59.969 --> 52:02.055
Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?

52:03.681 --> 52:06.893
Hello? Oh, I can't believe
I'm talking to you in person.

52:06.976 --> 52:09.062
This is such an honour.

52:10.563 --> 52:13.066
Yes. He's right here.

52:13.149 --> 52:15.151
So then you know all about it.

52:15.235 --> 52:18.571
Well, that's exactly
what I've been using.

52:19.864 --> 52:25.620
Well, I've had a little trouble getting it
the right consistency... well, just a little.

52:26.579 --> 52:28.665
I'll try that.

52:30.875 --> 52:33.670
Well, what imaginative suggestions.

52:35.130 --> 52:38.633
I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

52:39.717 --> 52:41.970
No wonder she's the head of the company.

52:42.053 --> 52:45.682
You know, she started out as
a sales representative just like me.

52:45.765 --> 52:49.561
I've always wanted to talk to her,
but until now I never had a reason.

52:49.644 --> 52:51.729
Thanks, Edward.

52:52.647 --> 52:55.066
- She had some ideas?
- You bet she did.

53:09.497 --> 53:11.583
I'll get that.

53:52.916 --> 53:55.210
Edward. We're here.

53:55.293 --> 53:57.629
Come on, let's get you sharpened up.

54:01.007 --> 54:03.635
- You got it?
- No. I can't believe this.

54:03.718 --> 54:05.595
This is such a drag.

54:06.721 --> 54:08.181
Hi!

54:11.643 --> 54:13.728
Bye.

54:15.063 --> 54:16.773
Do you have a key?

54:16.856 --> 54:18.066
No.

54:18.149 --> 54:22.362
- I could have sworn they were in my purse.
- Well, we're stranded.

54:26.658 --> 54:28.743
Wow! Thanks!

54:29.994 --> 54:34.332
Ed! What a guy! Good job.
You didn't break it or scratch it or anything.

54:34.416 --> 54:37.210
Be a pal and yell when Peg pulls in.

54:40.588 --> 54:44.175
Quite a story, yes?
Any questions for Edward?

54:44.259 --> 54:46.386
Yeah? Get away over.

54:46.469 --> 54:47.929
Stand right up.

54:48.012 --> 54:51.141
What's been the best part
of your new life here in town?

54:51.224 --> 54:53.476
The friends I've made.

54:55.395 --> 54:57.439
Any other questions?

54:58.273 --> 55:02.235
Have you ever thought of having
corrective surgery or prosthetics?

55:02.318 --> 55:05.196
I know a doctor
that might be able to help you.

55:05.864 --> 55:07.490
I'd like to meet him.

55:07.574 --> 55:11.202
We'll get that name after the show.
Thank you. That's very nice.

55:11.286 --> 55:13.538
Anyone else? Yes, stand right up.

55:13.621 --> 55:16.166
But then you'd be like everyone else.

55:16.750 --> 55:18.251
Yes, I know.

55:18.334 --> 55:20.003
I think he'd like that.

55:20.086 --> 55:22.672
But then no one would
think you were special.

55:22.756 --> 55:24.883
You wouldn't be on TV or anything.

55:24.966 --> 55:28.011
No matter what,
Edward will always be special.

55:33.808 --> 55:36.394
More questions? Yes. Stand right up.

55:36.978 --> 55:40.064
Your work is so interesting,
distinctive and unique.

55:40.148 --> 55:43.151
Do you have any plans
to open your own beauty salon?

55:43.234 --> 55:45.320
Oh, there's an idea!

55:48.323 --> 55:51.159
Anyone else? Yeah. Stand right up.

55:51.242 --> 55:54.079
Do you have a girlfriend?

55:58.249 --> 56:00.168
Sure he does. Right, Kim?

56:00.251 --> 56:03.171
- Right, Kim?
- Great! Now you got him started.

56:03.254 --> 56:05.006
Knock it off, bubble-butt.

56:05.090 --> 56:06.716
- You did it.
- So?

56:07.842 --> 56:11.387
<i>How about it, Edward?</i>
<i>Is there some special lady in your life?</i>

56:41.751 --> 56:46.756
Everything's all right. We'll take a break
and we'll be back after these messages.

56:46.840 --> 56:48.716
Why are you laughing? He got hurt!

56:48.800 --> 56:52.345
- It was just a little shock. What do you care?
- A little shock?!

56:52.887 --> 56:57.434
I wish we'd been taping that.
I'd give my left nut to see that again.

56:58.101 --> 57:00.645
Aren't you excited? This is so thrillin'!

57:00.728 --> 57:05.400
Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect.
It's just what we've been lookin' for.

57:05.483 --> 57:07.986
I wanna call it Shear Heaven!

57:10.905 --> 57:12.824
And here we are.

57:12.907 --> 57:15.994
Now, all along here
I'm gonna put a row of new mirrors.

57:16.077 --> 57:18.455
And back along here, well, I think...

57:18.538 --> 57:20.415
Eddie! Come along, doll.

57:20.498 --> 57:26.004
Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics.
And all along this row here...

57:28.381 --> 57:31.009
- Peg could sell cosmetics.
- Yeah... Sure.

57:31.092 --> 57:33.845
And this of course
is where we wash the hair.

57:33.928 --> 57:37.766
And here is where I stand...
when I greet the customers.

57:37.849 --> 57:40.977
But back in here
is what I really wanna show you.

57:44.898 --> 57:49.068
Eddie... This is what
I really want to show you.

57:49.152 --> 57:52.405
Now, this is the storeroom
where we keep everything,

57:52.489 --> 57:56.659
and what I need from you today
is a decision I need you to help me make.

57:56.743 --> 57:59.788
Honey, no! No, don't. That's dangerous.

57:59.871 --> 58:02.373
Now, you just sit right down there...

58:04.584 --> 58:09.089
I have some smocks.
Would you like me to model them for you?

58:09.506 --> 58:10.882
Yes.

58:10.965 --> 58:13.051
OK.

58:40.120 --> 58:42.205
Now, this is my favourite.

58:43.248 --> 58:45.333
Because it's yellow...

58:46.876 --> 58:48.837
And what it's for...

58:50.463 --> 58:54.592
is to catch those itchy little
trimmings that fall down your neck.

58:57.470 --> 59:03.101
And then there's this old purple one
that you kinda drape around you like this.

59:05.645 --> 59:07.730
I like that one.

59:10.733 --> 59:12.777
Why, Eddie, you're tremblin'.

59:15.655 --> 59:17.407
So am I!

59:19.909 --> 59:22.412
I've been waitin' for this moment for so long.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.579
Edward!

01:00:04.662 --> 01:00:07.624
Edward, you come back here!
You can't do that!

01:00:19.552 --> 01:00:21.596
Velcro, sweetheart.

01:00:21.679 --> 01:00:24.599
- It hangs on the dashboard.
- I've never seen that.

01:00:24.682 --> 01:00:26.684
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Edward.

01:00:26.768 --> 01:00:29.896
Sorry, dear, we had to go ahead without you.
There you go.

01:00:29.979 --> 01:00:32.690
So, Edward, did you have a productive day?

01:00:32.774 --> 01:00:35.276
Mrs Monroe showed me
where the salon will be.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.947
- You could have a cosmetics counter.
- Wouldn't that be great?

01:00:39.781 --> 01:00:41.032
Great.

01:00:41.116 --> 01:00:44.494
Then she showed me the back room
where she took all her clothes off.

01:00:45.412 --> 01:00:49.290
Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm as pleased as punch.

01:00:49.374 --> 01:00:51.876
This venture's gonna teach you volumes.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.921
There's nothin' like
running your own business.

01:00:55.004 --> 01:00:56.840
I've never done it myself,

01:00:56.923 --> 01:01:01.052
but I gather it's the greatest satisfaction
a working man can have.

01:01:01.803 --> 01:01:04.848
So I guess the bank's
gonna be your next step, huh?

01:01:04.931 --> 01:01:06.558
The bank?

01:01:06.641 --> 01:01:10.103
Yeah. Take out a loan, get yourself started.

01:01:10.937 --> 01:01:16.025
Nothin' to worry about. With your talent
and reputation, it's gonna be a snap.

01:01:20.238 --> 01:01:22.031
No credit,

01:01:22.115 --> 01:01:24.534
no record ofjobs you've held,

01:01:24.617 --> 01:01:26.453
no savings,

01:01:26.536 --> 01:01:28.621
no personal investments...

01:01:29.372 --> 01:01:32.792
No social security number -
you may as well not even exist...

01:01:32.876 --> 01:01:37.046
- There is no collateral.
- No, we already have a second on the house.

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:39.382
But don't the testimonials count?

01:01:39.466 --> 01:01:43.344
Did you see here the mayor's wife
can't wait to become a client?

01:01:43.428 --> 01:01:45.388
We simply can't do it.

01:01:45.472 --> 01:01:50.643
Now, get yourself a social security card,
establish credit and buy yourself a car.

01:01:50.727 --> 01:01:54.689
You have a decided advantage.
You can get a handicapped placard

01:01:54.773 --> 01:01:56.608
and park anywhere you like.

01:01:59.652 --> 01:02:02.572
I can't believe it. It's just an outrage.

01:02:02.655 --> 01:02:07.494
But don't you worry. This isn't the end of it.
We'll get your money somehow.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.125
- But that's breaking and entering.
- My parents have insurance up the rear.

01:02:14.209 --> 01:02:17.754
What'll it cost them?
A little hassle, that's about it.

01:02:17.837 --> 01:02:21.007
- We can't.
- This guy'll give us cash for the stuff.

01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:22.675
I don't want to.

01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:27.263
You don't want us to have our own van where
we can be alone? And a mattress in the back?

01:02:27.347 --> 01:02:28.890
Why can't <i>you</i> do it?

01:02:28.973 --> 01:02:32.102
Because the room's locked
and we need Edward to get us in.

01:02:32.185 --> 01:02:34.479
Can't you take the key when he's sleeping?

01:02:34.562 --> 01:02:37.690
The only thing he hangs on to tighter
is his dick.

01:02:37.816 --> 01:02:41.194
- Razor Blades'll do anything for you.
- That's not true.

01:02:41.277 --> 01:02:43.988
- Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
- That's not fair.

01:02:44.072 --> 01:02:47.659
- So what? There isn't any other way.
- There's gotta be.

01:02:48.868 --> 01:02:50.829
Look, I've racked my brain.

01:02:50.912 --> 01:02:53.123
Don't you want us to have our own van?

01:02:53.206 --> 01:02:55.417
Yeah.

01:02:58.044 --> 01:02:59.838
Jim, the lights are on!

01:02:59.921 --> 01:03:03.758
Those go on automatically.
They're gone for the weekend, I told you.

01:03:03.842 --> 01:03:05.593
In case of burglars.

01:03:05.677 --> 01:03:08.096
- You turned off the alarm?
- Yes. Let's go.

01:03:08.179 --> 01:03:10.056
I hate this.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.560
Are you sure he doesn't know
this is Jim's house?

01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:16.771
- This person stole from you?
- Keep it down!

01:03:16.855 --> 01:03:18.898
I told you he stole it, OK? Let's go!

01:03:18.982 --> 01:03:21.818
Tell his parents
and they'll make him give it back.

01:03:21.901 --> 01:03:26.406
Listen, I already tried that.
Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Let's go.

01:03:26.489 --> 01:03:28.283
Come on!

01:03:33.079 --> 01:03:35.165
OK, come on.

01:04:04.569 --> 01:04:07.155
The bastard had it wired separately.
Come on!

01:04:07.238 --> 01:04:09.491
No, Jim, we can't just leave him here!

01:04:17.582 --> 01:04:19.375
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna do this!

01:04:19.459 --> 01:04:21.544
- Just come on, Kim.
- Stop!

01:04:22.128 --> 01:04:24.214
Put me down!

01:04:52.242 --> 01:04:54.285
<i>We know you're in there!</i>

01:04:54.786 --> 01:04:59.457
<i>We're in the process of deactivating</i>
<i>the system so that you can come out!</i>

01:05:11.511 --> 01:05:13.304
- Denny, turn around!
- No way.

01:05:13.388 --> 01:05:16.516
Jim, they can't arrest you
for setting off your own alarm.

01:05:16.599 --> 01:05:18.435
We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran.

01:05:18.518 --> 01:05:20.812
- I'm not going back there, OK?
- We have to!

01:05:20.895 --> 01:05:22.730
No. My father would prosecute.

01:05:22.814 --> 01:05:24.983
- His own son?
- Especially his own son.

01:05:25.066 --> 01:05:27.235
And if Edward tells I'll kill him!

01:05:27.902 --> 01:05:29.988
- Denny, turn around!
- No!

01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:31.573
You have to!

01:05:31.656 --> 01:05:35.452
<i>We want your hands high in the air</i>
<i>where we can see them!</i>

01:05:40.707 --> 01:05:42.792
<i>Put your hands up!</i>

01:05:47.922 --> 01:05:50.508
He's holding something. Looks like knives.

01:05:50.592 --> 01:05:52.385
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.306
<i>I repeat- drop your weapons!</i>

01:05:56.389 --> 01:06:01.186
<i>I'm gonna ask you one more time.</i>
<i>This is your last warning. Drop your weapons.</i>

01:06:05.523 --> 01:06:10.487
<i>If you fail to do so we'll have to open fire.</i>
<i>Don't make us do that, buddy.</i>

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:13.656
<i>Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!</i>

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.033
<i>Now!</i>

01:06:15.116 --> 01:06:17.035
Looks like we got a psycho.

01:06:17.118 --> 01:06:19.162
- Prepare to fire!
- No!

01:06:19.245 --> 01:06:23.374
- Stand back, ladies!
- Those aren't weapons, those are his hands!

01:06:23.458 --> 01:06:25.543
Please. We know him.

01:06:27.212 --> 01:06:28.838
All right. Cuff him.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.599
- But we can see him now?
- We're going to have to hold him overnight.

01:06:39.682 --> 01:06:44.312
- He has to stay in prison all night?
- You can pick him up in the morning.

01:06:44.395 --> 01:06:46.481
Oh, Edward!

01:06:46.606 --> 01:06:48.817
Hello, Edward.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.444
Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.

01:06:51.528 --> 01:06:54.864
What in God's name
was going through your mind, son?

01:06:54.948 --> 01:06:59.577
Why didn't I set a better example?
You saw how I envied Jim's parents.

01:06:59.661 --> 01:07:01.871
What were you gonna do with that stuff?

01:07:01.955 --> 01:07:05.333
I blithely say "We'll get money
for the salon somehow",

01:07:05.417 --> 01:07:07.335
but I never meant stealing.

01:07:07.419 --> 01:07:11.798
Dear, stealing's not the way to get it.
Stealing's not the way to get anything.

01:07:11.881 --> 01:07:15.635
Except trouble.
And you're in a serious heap of that.

01:07:15.718 --> 01:07:18.346
Oh, Edward. Why ever did you do this?

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:22.016
- Damn those TV programmes!
- Damn them all to hell!

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.269
Or did somebody put you up to this?

01:07:37.407 --> 01:07:39.784
Will he be OK, doc?

01:07:39.868 --> 01:07:44.914
The years spent in isolation have not given
him the tools to judge right from wrong.

01:07:44.998 --> 01:07:48.334
He's had no context.
He's been completely without guidance.

01:07:48.418 --> 01:07:52.380
Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures,
hairstyles and so forth,

01:07:52.464 --> 01:07:55.300
indicate that he's a highly imaginative...

01:07:55.383 --> 01:07:56.760
character.

01:07:56.843 --> 01:08:01.014
His awareness of what we call reality
is radically underdeveloped.

01:08:01.097 --> 01:08:04.058
But will he be all right out there?

01:08:04.476 --> 01:08:06.561
Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.

01:08:12.692 --> 01:08:18.238
Listen, it could keep me up all night worrying
about ya. You watch yourself, you hear?

01:08:23.453 --> 01:08:26.206
I happened to be up,
so I heard all this noise...

01:08:26.288 --> 01:08:30.167
All along I felt in my gut
there was somethin' wrong with him.

01:08:31.586 --> 01:08:35.090
- It could have been my house.
- Or any of our houses, but...

01:08:35.173 --> 01:08:39.344
I warned you, didn't I?
I saw the sign of Satan on him.

01:08:39.426 --> 01:08:44.265
You didn't heed my warning, but now
you will. Because now you can see it too.

01:09:00.073 --> 01:09:01.866
Edward, you stay here.

01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:05.120
- What do you say in your defence?
- Nothing.

01:09:05.203 --> 01:09:08.540
- He doesn't want to talk.
- You have to say something.

01:09:08.622 --> 01:09:12.127
- He can't talk right now.
- No comments? No remarks?

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:15.546
So, were you set up?
What was going through your mind?

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:18.383
What do you have to say for yourself?

01:09:18.466 --> 01:09:21.803
- One comment.
- Later.

01:09:22.595 --> 01:09:26.057
Goodness, Lois, it looks like
I'll see you at our Christmas party

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:28.435
before I get you over for your haircut!

01:09:28.518 --> 01:09:33.982
Well, of course we're gonna have it this year.
We have it every year. Why wouldn't we?

01:09:36.234 --> 01:09:37.652
Well!

01:09:37.734 --> 01:09:40.529
You may think that, but you're wrong.

01:09:45.201 --> 01:09:47.287
You're here.

01:09:49.122 --> 01:09:51.207
They didn't hurt you, did they?

01:09:53.877 --> 01:09:55.628
Were you scared?

01:09:59.174 --> 01:10:03.845
I tried to make Jim go back,
but you can't make Jim do anything.

01:10:10.351 --> 01:10:12.771
Thank you for not telling them that we...

01:10:13.354 --> 01:10:15.148
You're welcome.

01:10:18.276 --> 01:10:21.905
It must have been awful
when they told you whose house it was.

01:10:23.782 --> 01:10:25.867
I knew it was Jim's house.

01:10:26.534 --> 01:10:28.620
You did?

01:10:29.412 --> 01:10:31.081
Yes.

01:10:32.999 --> 01:10:35.085
Well, then why'd you do it?

01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:39.214
Because you asked me to.

01:10:42.425 --> 01:10:44.010
Kimba!

01:10:44.094 --> 01:10:46.513
Kimmy!

01:10:54.729 --> 01:10:57.148
- Don't!
- What's the matter with you?

01:10:57.232 --> 01:10:59.484
When are you gonna stop? I did what I could.

01:10:59.567 --> 01:11:02.987
My old man thinks he's retarded, so he's free.
What more do you want?

01:11:03.071 --> 01:11:06.366
- You could tell the truth.
- So could you. You were there too!

01:11:06.449 --> 01:11:10.286
- You know I didn't wanna do it.
- But you did do it.

01:11:10.995 --> 01:11:13.706
I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.

01:11:44.446 --> 01:11:48.575
Maybe there's a way you can
replace the drapes and the towels,

01:11:48.658 --> 01:11:52.245
but our confidence in you
is not gonna be so easy to replace.

01:11:52.328 --> 01:11:53.913
Dad...

01:11:55.039 --> 01:12:00.670
OK. A little ethics. You're walkin' down
the street. You find a suitcase full of money.

01:12:00.754 --> 01:12:05.175
There's nobody around. No human person
is in evidence. What do you do?

01:12:05.258 --> 01:12:07.677
A: You keep the money.

01:12:07.761 --> 01:12:12.223
B: You use it to buy gifts
for your friends and your loved ones.

01:12:12.307 --> 01:12:15.268
C: You give it to the poor.

01:12:16.019 --> 01:12:19.189
D: You turn it in to the police.

01:12:19.272 --> 01:12:21.691
- Dad, this is really stupid.
- Kim...!

01:12:21.775 --> 01:12:23.735
- I'd keep the money.
- Simmer down.

01:12:23.818 --> 01:12:25.069
Edward?

01:12:26.404 --> 01:12:30.492
Hey, how about after dinner we go down
to the bowling alley? That'd be fun.

01:12:30.575 --> 01:12:32.535
You're not seeing Jim tonight?

01:12:32.619 --> 01:12:34.120
No.

01:12:34.913 --> 01:12:36.998
We had the coolest show and tell today.

01:12:37.082 --> 01:12:41.961
This kid brought in a box of baby possums.
Ten, maybe twelve. Totally naked.

01:12:42.045 --> 01:12:46.216
- No hair at all.
- Honey, your father isn't finished yet.

01:12:46.674 --> 01:12:49.427
Thank you, dear. Edward, we're waiting.

01:12:52.514 --> 01:12:54.599
Give it to my loved ones?

01:12:57.811 --> 01:13:02.232
Oh, Edward, it does seem that
that's what you should do, but it's not.

01:13:05.193 --> 01:13:09.572
You dope, everybody knows
you're supposed to give it to the police.

01:13:11.199 --> 01:13:12.992
Good thinking, Kevin.

01:13:13.076 --> 01:13:15.662
Well, think about it, you guys.

01:13:15.745 --> 01:13:19.207
I mean, that's the nicer thing to do.
That's what <i>I</i> would do.

01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:25.213
We're not trying to confuse him, we're trying
to make things easier, so cut the comedy.

01:13:25.296 --> 01:13:28.425
I am being serious, Dad.
It's a much nicer thing to do.

01:13:28.508 --> 01:13:31.094
Forget nice. We're talking right and wrong.

01:13:31.511 --> 01:13:32.554
Shut up!

01:13:32.637 --> 01:13:38.768
Oh, goodness! No wonder poor Edward can't
learn right from wrong, living in this family!

01:13:38.852 --> 01:13:41.855
Well, did you hear
what he did to Peg's curtains?

01:13:41.938 --> 01:13:45.859
It's unbelievable they're having
their party anyway. Are you going?

01:13:45.942 --> 01:13:47.652
I don't think so.

01:13:47.735 --> 01:13:51.072
He practically raped Joyce,
threatening her with those knives.

01:13:51.156 --> 01:13:52.949
It's a miracle she escaped.

01:13:53.032 --> 01:13:55.243
I have nothing against Bill and Peg, but...

01:13:55.326 --> 01:13:58.621
I know. They've got that
teenage daughter in the house.

01:13:58.705 --> 01:14:01.624
Those poor things!
After what happened to me...

01:14:01.708 --> 01:14:03.460
Can you imagine?

01:14:03.543 --> 01:14:05.920
What did you say about the Christmas party?

01:14:06.004 --> 01:14:08.047
I said I hoped we could make it.

01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:10.049
I lied too.

01:14:30.028 --> 01:14:32.947
Edward? Do you want to
give me that new haircut?

01:14:33.531 --> 01:14:35.825
- Again?
- Yeah, sure!

01:14:35.909 --> 01:14:40.288
It makes me proud to have you
as my own personal hairdresser.

01:14:42.874 --> 01:14:44.709
Hi, honey.

01:14:44.793 --> 01:14:47.837
- Kevin, want to play scissors, paper, stone?
- No.

01:14:47.921 --> 01:14:51.174
- Why?
- It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.

01:14:51.257 --> 01:14:54.427
- People's feelings, please. A few manners!
- I'll be outside.

01:14:54.511 --> 01:14:58.848
Never you mind, dear. Just... cut away.

01:15:09.067 --> 01:15:11.736
# I saw three ships come sailing by

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.697
# On Christmas day in the morning

01:15:21.746 --> 01:15:25.417
It needs something... else.
What do you think, honey?

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.420
- More bells?
- OK.

01:15:28.503 --> 01:15:31.548
Mom, do you really think
we should be having this party?

01:15:31.631 --> 01:15:34.426
Of course I think
we should be having this party.

01:15:34.509 --> 01:15:41.182
It's just what we need to calm things down...
and everything'll go back to normal.

01:15:43.017 --> 01:15:45.186
Do you have any more bells, honey?

01:17:37.173 --> 01:17:39.384
Now you've done it.

01:17:39.467 --> 01:17:41.970
It's just a scratch, Jim, really. It's OK.

01:17:42.053 --> 01:17:45.098
- Touch her again and I'll kill ya.
- It's no big deal.

01:17:45.181 --> 01:17:47.851
- Call a doctor. He skewered Kim.
- No!

01:17:47.934 --> 01:17:49.769
Stay away from her. I mean it!

01:17:49.853 --> 01:17:54.149
You can't touch anything without ruining it.
Why do you hang around here anyway?

01:17:54.232 --> 01:17:58.737
I want you to sit right down
and wait for me to bring you some ice.

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.364
Stay right there. I'll be right back.

01:18:07.412 --> 01:18:09.831
Get the hell outta here!

01:18:10.373 --> 01:18:12.917
Get the hell out! Go! Freak!

01:18:13.668 --> 01:18:15.837
Hey, Edward, where are you goin'?

01:18:23.678 --> 01:18:25.346
Where is he?

01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:28.141
- He tried to hurt you.
- He did not, and you know it.

01:18:28.224 --> 01:18:30.685
Are you nuts? I just saw him!

01:18:30.769 --> 01:18:35.648
Jim, I don't love you any more.
I just want you to go, OK? Just go!

01:18:36.441 --> 01:18:38.151
Are you serious?

01:18:38.234 --> 01:18:40.820
And lose you to that? He isn't even human.

01:18:40.904 --> 01:18:43.615
Just get out of here, OK? Just go!

01:18:51.623 --> 01:18:53.666
Dad, did you see where Edward went?

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:56.294
I don't know. He just waltzed down the street.

01:18:56.377 --> 01:18:59.339
- We have to find him, Mom.
- Your father will find him.

01:18:59.422 --> 01:19:01.633
Go on in the house. I'll take care of it.

01:19:01.716 --> 01:19:03.802
I'll go find him.

01:19:21.111 --> 01:19:22.404
Edward!

01:19:22.487 --> 01:19:24.572
I'm calling the police!

01:20:12.454 --> 01:20:15.749
See all that blood, sweetie?
And it's just a little cut.

01:20:26.050 --> 01:20:28.553
Hello. I'm here to see the man with the hands.

01:20:32.682 --> 01:20:34.851
He's not here. Thank you.

01:20:35.852 --> 01:20:38.062
Oh, dear.

01:20:39.814 --> 01:20:42.150
Helen, did you actually see him?

01:20:42.233 --> 01:20:43.818
Yes! Look!

01:20:49.532 --> 01:20:51.659
I'm looking for the man with the scissors.

01:20:51.743 --> 01:20:55.163
- Thank God you're here.
- He went right down that way, sir.

01:20:55.246 --> 01:20:58.833
All right, calm down.
Go on home. We'll handle it.

01:20:58.917 --> 01:21:00.752
Just go home.

01:21:00.835 --> 01:21:04.756
- A demon. A demon.
- You gotta do somethin'!

01:21:12.388 --> 01:21:14.891
I'm sure your father'll find him soon.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.685
What time is it?

01:21:18.228 --> 01:21:22.190
It's almost 8.30. Great party, huh?

01:21:22.273 --> 01:21:24.359
Mom, where are they?

01:21:25.902 --> 01:21:28.905
- God, I hope he's OK.
- So do I, honey.

01:21:34.369 --> 01:21:38.164
You know, when I brought Edward
down here to live with us,

01:21:39.582 --> 01:21:42.210
I really didn't think things through.

01:21:43.253 --> 01:21:46.423
And I didn't think about
what could happen to him.

01:21:47.757 --> 01:21:51.261
Or to us. Or to the neighbourhood.

01:21:53.638 --> 01:21:55.723
And now I think that maybe...

01:21:57.475 --> 01:21:59.561
it might be best if he goes...

01:22:01.062 --> 01:22:03.148
back up there.

01:22:03.898 --> 01:22:06.067
Because at least there he's safe.

01:22:08.445 --> 01:22:11.114
And we'd just go back to normal.

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:17.203
I got halfway to the Whitmans'.
I didn't see him anywhere.

01:22:17.287 --> 01:22:19.539
Let's get in the car and go look for him.

01:22:19.622 --> 01:22:21.624
- Where's Kevin now?
- At Max's.

01:22:21.708 --> 01:22:23.543
Oh, for God's sakes!

01:22:23.626 --> 01:22:26.296
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- With you guys.

01:22:26.379 --> 01:22:30.800
- You stay here in case somebody shows up.
- We'll be right back, dear.

01:23:09.672 --> 01:23:11.758
Police!

01:23:48.545 --> 01:23:50.630
Edward?

01:23:53.466 --> 01:23:55.135
Are you OK?

01:23:56.511 --> 01:23:58.304
Yes. Are you OK?

01:24:02.517 --> 01:24:04.310
Where is everybody?

01:24:05.019 --> 01:24:07.105
Out looking for you.

01:24:13.153 --> 01:24:15.071
Hold me.

01:24:28.877 --> 01:24:30.295
I can't.

01:24:59.032 --> 01:25:03.453
I know it's a little early
for Christmas, Edward, but...

01:25:06.831 --> 01:25:08.917
I have a present for you.

01:27:07.327 --> 01:27:09.162
Forget holding her hand.

01:27:09.245 --> 01:27:11.831
Picture the damage he could do other places.

01:27:11.915 --> 01:27:14.000
Yeah. That's sick.

01:27:19.714 --> 01:27:22.592
I feel like I'm gonna pass out
or puke or something.

01:27:22.675 --> 01:27:25.178
Later. First, take me to her house.

01:27:25.261 --> 01:27:27.138
Come on. Don't make me drive.

01:27:27.222 --> 01:27:28.765
Just do it!

01:27:29.307 --> 01:27:31.309
Jesus. Maybe she <i>was</i> right about you.

01:27:31.392 --> 01:27:33.478
- Just drive!
- Relax!

01:27:37.816 --> 01:27:40.777
- See you tomorrow. Call me.
- All right.

01:27:59.003 --> 01:28:01.297
Have they caught him yet?

01:28:02.048 --> 01:28:05.301
- Who?
- Him! That cripple.

01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:10.890
Let me know when they do.

01:28:12.976 --> 01:28:15.061
Let us all know, OK?

01:28:16.104 --> 01:28:18.189
Like a good boy.

01:28:38.752 --> 01:28:40.211
Kevin.

01:28:45.216 --> 01:28:46.885
Are you OK?

01:28:46.968 --> 01:28:48.470
It's OK.

01:28:52.307 --> 01:28:54.476
- Edward, stop!
- I'm your friend.

01:28:59.064 --> 01:29:00.565
Help us!

01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:05.987
What are you doing? Get away from him!

01:29:14.579 --> 01:29:16.456
- Let go of me!
- What?

01:29:16.539 --> 01:29:18.333
Kevin!

01:29:25.048 --> 01:29:28.134
- Get away!
- Edward, come home!

01:29:59.874 --> 01:30:00.917
Run.

01:30:28.486 --> 01:30:32.073
Kevin's all right!
It was just the tiniest scratch!

01:30:32.157 --> 01:30:36.453
He's gone. Let's not bother him, all right?
Let's just leave him alone.

01:30:44.961 --> 01:30:47.046
Go on, run.

01:30:51.593 --> 01:30:54.345
- What happened? Is he dead?
- Did you get him?

01:30:55.013 --> 01:30:58.141
It's all over. Go on home.
There's nothing more to see.

01:30:58.224 --> 01:31:02.854
What happened out there?
I want to know! I want some answers!

01:31:02.937 --> 01:31:05.482
It is all over.

01:31:05.565 --> 01:31:07.650
Where is he?

01:31:09.444 --> 01:31:12.614
Get back here!
I wanna ask you something!

01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:21.122
Look at that! I don't believe this.

01:31:22.415 --> 01:31:24.417
They don't have him. I'm goin'.

01:31:24.501 --> 01:31:26.586
No! That's not a good idea.

01:32:32.026 --> 01:32:34.112
They're coming?

01:32:36.656 --> 01:32:38.658
Did I hurt Kevin?

01:32:38.742 --> 01:32:42.287
No, he's OK. Mostly he was just scared.

01:32:44.289 --> 01:32:46.958
Edward, I was so afraid.

01:32:47.584 --> 01:32:49.836
I thought you were dead.

01:32:57.552 --> 01:32:59.095
I didn't.

01:33:07.896 --> 01:33:09.397
No!

01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:20.658
No!

01:33:20.742 --> 01:33:22.744
Jim, stop!

01:33:39.677 --> 01:33:40.720
No!

01:33:44.307 --> 01:33:47.185
Stop it. Or I'll kill you myself.

01:33:59.155 --> 01:34:01.074
I said stay away from her!

01:35:01.217 --> 01:35:03.052
Goodbye.

01:35:14.355 --> 01:35:16.191
I love you.

01:36:04.406 --> 01:36:06.282
Is he in there?

01:36:08.451 --> 01:36:10.203
He's dead.

01:36:13.998 --> 01:36:16.167
The roof caved in on him.

01:36:17.252 --> 01:36:19.295
They killed each other.

01:36:22.132 --> 01:36:24.843
You can see for yourselves.

01:36:26.803 --> 01:36:28.513
See?

01:36:37.647 --> 01:36:39.733
I'm goin' home.

01:36:48.575 --> 01:36:50.660
Joyce...

01:37:07.844 --> 01:37:09.929
She never saw him again.

01:37:11.723 --> 01:37:13.850
Not after that night.

01:37:14.684 --> 01:37:16.770
How do you know?

01:37:23.526 --> 01:37:25.612
Because I was there.

01:37:26.279 --> 01:37:30.033
You could have gone up there.
You still could go.

01:37:31.367 --> 01:37:33.745
No, sweetheart.

01:37:33.828 --> 01:37:35.914
I'm an old woman now.

01:37:36.873 --> 01:37:39.667
I would rather him remember me
the way I was.

01:38:14.619 --> 01:38:16.704
How do you know he's still alive?

01:38:18.957 --> 01:38:21.126
I don't know.

01:38:21.209 --> 01:38:23.628
Not for sure, but...

01:38:24.212 --> 01:38:26.506
I believe he is.

01:38:35.849 --> 01:38:42.689
<i>You see, before he came down here</i>
<i>it never snowed.</i>

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.947
And afterwards it did.

01:38:53.199 --> 01:38:58.121
If he weren't up there now,
I don't think it would be snowing.

01:39:00.707 --> 01:39:04.169
Sometimes you can still catch me
dancing in it.

01:44:43.299 --> 01:44:50.932
