If you make me late, Maurice,
so help me, I will hurt Mort!

00:52.302 --> 00:54.220
-Yay!
-Judy the Goddess of Seafood leaves her sea harvest at midday.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.599
It is not midday!

00:57.682 --> 01:01.352
What if maybe the world sped up?
What then, huh?

01:01.436 --> 01:02.896
You want me to speed up?

01:02.979 --> 01:05.190
Hey!

01:05.273 --> 01:07.108
Come on, that's cheating, Maurice!

01:10.278 --> 01:13.406
I told you it's not midday.
When it's midday--

01:16.451 --> 01:19.245
This is amazing!

01:19.329 --> 01:21.790
Thanks, Judy! Appreciate it.

01:23.333 --> 01:28.004
Eh, got to say, Judy kind of dropped
the ball this year on the harvest.

01:28.087 --> 01:31.424
I haven't even found something
that burns my skin when I touch it.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.426
My King, look at this!

01:33.510 --> 01:34.677
Hmm?

01:35.345 --> 01:38.056
Now we're talking! First sip, I called it!

01:38.139 --> 01:39.098
Me second!

01:39.182 --> 01:42.852
Whoa, whoa, shouldn't we have an idea
about what this is before you drink it?

01:42.936 --> 01:45.480
-I don't understand the question.

01:45.563 --> 01:48.525
It's like he's speaking
a different language. I don't get it.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.985
Why don't we have Timo
look at this first?

01:51.069 --> 01:54.197
Come on, come on, let's go!
Timo, I am working up a powerful thirst

01:54.280 --> 01:57.450
for something that may or may not
mutate my body. Let's go.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.036
I wouldn't recommend drinking this,
Your Majesty.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.372
Far as I can tell, this is plant food.

02:02.455 --> 02:06.084
Wait. Plants eat food

02:06.167 --> 02:08.002
Wow. How do they hold their forks?

02:08.086 --> 02:09.379
The leaves, maybe?

02:09.462 --> 02:12.549
I always thought that jungle
was a little handsy.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.677
Not that kind of food. Liquid nutrients.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.719
See this writing?

02:16.803 --> 02:20.807
"Pure organic impossibly safe
organic nutrients."

02:20.890 --> 02:22.851
Yep, definitely plant food.

02:22.934 --> 02:26.146
You know, I've been making
my own compost for years using only my--

02:26.229 --> 02:30.066
Stop right there, Timo.
There could be children watching.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.277
So this, uh, plant food--

02:32.360 --> 02:34.737
what exactly does it, uh, do?

02:34.821 --> 02:38.074
Well, I guess you could say
it supercharges them.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.368
It makes them stronger
so they produce more.

02:40.451 --> 02:46.166
Oh! Oh! I'm getting an idea!

02:46.249 --> 02:47.625
Ta-da!

02:49.627 --> 02:51.212
This plant food is gonna give me

02:51.296 --> 02:55.383
the most mango-rich kingdom
in all of Madagascar.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.802
You already have
the most mango-rich kingdom

02:57.886 --> 02:59.178
in all of Madagascar.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.139
Exactly! Which is why I need more.

03:01.222 --> 03:05.393
Greatness is all about how much
you have when you're dead, Maurice.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.937
Mango King right here, y'all! Right here!

03:08.021 --> 03:12.025
Well, I thought greatness was
about good deeds and kindness and such.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.406
No. No. Oh.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.575
You know, uh, if this works,

03:20.658 --> 03:23.578
we're finally gonna have
enough surplus mangos

03:23.661 --> 03:26.456
to trade for some real weapons.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.709
I heard the crocodiles have gotten
their hands on a drone.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.295
Mm. You drone-t say.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.301
You two are crazy!
Timo, tell them they're crazy.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.262
What are you doing?

03:41.346 --> 03:45.850
I'm calling the company that made
the plant food--Sunshine Farm Place.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.895
I figure they might be able
to tell us if the plant food is safe.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.605
And

03:50.688 --> 03:53.316
They put me on hold.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.400
Hmm?

03:54.484 --> 03:55.818
Don't worry, Maurice.

03:55.902 --> 03:59.197
I told them to only put a quarter
of the plant food in the water supply,

03:59.280 --> 04:00.406
just to be safe.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.203
Sure Timo said the whole barrel?

04:05.286 --> 04:06.621
Yep! That's what I heard.

04:06.704 --> 04:07.956
Okay!

04:08.998 --> 04:14.337
Oh!

04:14.420 --> 04:18.132
You may sprinkle when ready.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.220
Bring it!

04:23.846 --> 04:26.516
-Whoo-hoo!
Spray it on me!

04:26.599 --> 04:27.684
Spray it in my mouth!

04:34.107 --> 04:38.069
What's the matter, Maurice?
A little scared of toxic chemicals?

04:38.152 --> 04:40.905
We're getting soaked
in glowing green plant food, Mort!

04:40.989 --> 04:44.200
Oh, I know. Isn't it refreshing?

04:44.284 --> 04:47.161
Oh! So luxurious.

04:48.621 --> 04:53.001
So how long we talking
till this mang

04:53.084 --> 04:55.295
I got my eye on a rice cooker
that seats 12,

04:55.378 --> 04:57.839
and I'm a little short on fruit
to seal the deal.

04:57.922 --> 05:01.759
Hard to say, Your Majesty.
These things don't happen overnight.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.767
I can assure you, madame,

05:09.851 --> 05:13.730
this booty is 100% tax deductible.

05:18.943 --> 05:22.363
Get behind me, Your Majesty!
I think we're under some kind of attack.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.700
Mangos?

05:29.078 --> 05:31.539
We're all gonna die--

05:34.083 --> 05:39.464
My beverage!

05:41.215 --> 05:43.885
Oh, yeah. Right there, sister.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.679
Your Majesty, what's happening?

05:46.763 --> 05:50.349
The plant food. It finally worked!

05:50.433 --> 05:52.477
I knew you could do it, my king!

05:52.560 --> 05:54.729
Mort, stop standing so close to me.

05:54.812 --> 05:58.274
You smell like a hermit crab
with gingivitis.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.735
-Oh, sorry.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.862
I no bath this year.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.280
But I heard Mort.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.157
I'm right here, Your Majesty.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.451
It was only a matter of time
before she ate him.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.704
All right, well, I'll put her down.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.872
No, I'm okay!

06:16.417 --> 06:19.879
Zora has an armpit pouch
from an old wound,

06:19.962 --> 06:22.423
and I just love to sleep in it.

06:22.507 --> 06:26.177
It also doubles as a change purse.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.805
Your Majesty, this is incredible.

06:28.888 --> 06:33.101
I hoped there'd be a spike
in mango production, but not like this!

06:33.184 --> 06:34.560
Where are we gonna put it all?

06:35.394 --> 06:36.521
Aha!

06:36.604 --> 06:39.982
-Lemurs of Madagascar!

06:40.066 --> 06:42.443
Find anything you can to store the mangos.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.445
Buckets, carts, Willie's hut.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.280
What the heck, man?

06:46.364 --> 06:48.116
Whatever it takes.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.619
We're gonna go to our graves
with more mangos

06:51.702 --> 06:55.665
than anyone's ever had
in the history of the world!

Oh, wow.

07:49.594 --> 07:53.848
Uh, Your Majesty, that rice cooker looks
dangerously close to the edge.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.808
What, are you a contractor now?

07:55.892 --> 07:59.854
Relax, Timo. We are the most
mango-rich Kingdom in all the land.

07:59.937 --> 08:03.149
And everyone knows that being rich
means nothing ever goes wrong.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.775
It's, like, a historical fact.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.072
-Yeah, that's why I'm here.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.991
Oh, nurse.

08:12.074 --> 08:15.161
Eh, keep the bubbles going, ladies.
I'll be right back.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.461
-The mangos are growing out of control!

08:24.420 --> 08:27.089
Aah! Where are they all coming from?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.591
We're all gonna--Aah!

08:30.760 --> 08:33.846
Mangos killed my family!

08:33.930 --> 08:36.224
It must be the plant food!

08:36.307 --> 08:37.850
Uh, you think?

08:37.934 --> 08:40.269
We need to get everyone
to safety, Your Majesty!

08:40.353 --> 08:42.605
Zora! Where's Zora?

08:45.608 --> 08:46.859
My love...

08:48.319 --> 08:52.198
I tried to fight them off,
but the mangos...

08:52.281 --> 08:55.159
they invaded my armpit pouch.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.119
No!

08:57.203 --> 08:59.622
That's my wife, you mango scum!

08:59.705 --> 09:03.584
We can't stay down here!
The mangos are rising too fast!

09:03.668 --> 09:07.421
Oi!
Stop your blabbering and get on the plane!

09:10.341 --> 09:13.553
Timo, there--there must be some antidote,

09:13.636 --> 09:17.265
some highly toxic spray
whose ingredients will alter our DNA.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.517
I'll alter your DNA, Your Majesty.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.394
Oh!

09:23.312 --> 09:25.523
Who would have thought
this glorious booty, which has escaped death countless times,

09:27.900 --> 09:30.194
would be felled by mangos?

09:30.778 --> 09:32.863
It's not fair, Frank! It's not...

09:34.115 --> 09:35.241
Uh...

09:35.324 --> 09:37.034
Where did all the mangos go?

09:39.620 --> 09:41.664
We got them on the run, King J!

09:41.747 --> 09:46.419
I say we capture those fruits
and pulp every one of them.

09:46.502 --> 09:50.590
Make a protein shake out of their innards.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.426
None of this makes any sense.
Where are they going?

09:55.052 --> 09:56.470
Uh, what's that, Maurice?

09:56.554 --> 10:00.057
You--you want to lead us and face
any danger that might be waiting

10:00.141 --> 10:01.934
I didn't say--Aah!

10:02.018 --> 10:04.020
Mo Mo

10:04.103 --> 10:06.981
Yeah, he's dead. Dibs on his hut.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.191
King Julien! You need to see this!

10:14.947 --> 10:16.282
Where am I?

10:16.365 --> 10:18.743
Oh, my--

10:18.826 --> 10:19.910
Yes!

10:19.994 --> 10:23.623
Ah! What's better than
having the most mangos?

10:23.706 --> 10:26.167
Having one giant mango, y'all.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.003
Ah! That talks! Ah!

10:29.086 --> 10:32.256
Scientifically, Your Majesty,
this is impossible.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.299
Fruit do not talk.

10:33.382 --> 10:37.928
Oh, uh, pretty serious
fruit profiling there, Timo.

10:38.012 --> 10:41.724
FYI, I know a pineapple
who would disagree with you.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.520
He's right, kids.
Fruit profiling is no joke.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.065
Educate yourself, uh...

10:49.148 --> 10:50.358
and stay in school.

10:50.441 --> 10:54.195
We have no idea
what this Giant Mango is capable of.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.155
We have to destroy it.

10:57.573 --> 11:01.243
You want the Giant Mango taken out,
Your Majesty, just say the word.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.746
I got a van full of these blenders.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.332
Mango can scream all he wants.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.293
Ain't no one gonna hear.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.420
Destroy it? Never!

11:11.504 --> 11:14.799
I have created life!

11:14.882 --> 11:18.511
Forget Mango King.
We're talking Mango God here!

11:18.594 --> 11:19.887
I don't understand.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.848
We used exactly the right amount
of plant food.

11:22.932 --> 11:26.602
Plus, the barrel King Julien and I
dumped in the sprayer machine.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.145
You used the whole barrel?

11:28.229 --> 11:32.483
I think we can all admit mistakes
were made and that Maurice is sorry.

11:32.566 --> 11:33.567
I'm sorry?

11:33.651 --> 11:36.570
But don't you see the gift
we have been given?

11:36.654 --> 11:41.158
Precisely! Lives! Changing!

11:41.242 --> 11:44.078
I, for one, feel really good about that,

11:44.161 --> 11:46.122
which is why there's no time to waste.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.542
We need to exploit that mango
for profit right away!

11:49.625 --> 11:51.585
Ted, you have a degree in marketing.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.962
I do not, sir.

11:53.045 --> 11:57.758
Excellent. I want to blanket Madagascar
with Giant Mango promotional materials.

11:57.842 --> 12:02.638
I'm talking Giant Mango branded rides,
Giant Mango branded clothing,

12:02.721 --> 12:05.474
Giant Mango branded hair extensions.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.642
Hey, where's Mort?

12:06.725 --> 12:09.728
Oh, I sent him ahead
to do a little pre-interview

12:09.812 --> 12:11.814
with the Giant Mango before we got there.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.233
Speak up, you!

12:14.316 --> 12:17.111
What are you hiding? Spill it!

12:17.194 --> 12:20.531
Mort, you indignant toilet brush,
what are you doing?

12:20.614 --> 12:22.700
I am so sorry.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.536
How's my superstar today

12:25.619 --> 12:27.037
Are you my father?

12:27.121 --> 12:30.791
Father, mother, agent,
realtor, spiritual advisor.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.501
Whatever you need, buddy.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.003
Your Majesty, if I may.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.880
What's your purpose here, big fella?

12:35.963 --> 12:39.633
Give the fruit a break, Clover.
He was just born.

12:39.717 --> 12:43.012
-Don't worry, buddy. We got big plans.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.388
Big plans!

12:44.472 --> 12:46.432
Anything I can get you right now, though?

12:46.515 --> 12:48.893
I am hungry, Father.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.686
Hey, no problem!

12:50.769 --> 12:54.773
Ted, get our cash cow--
eh, guest something to nosh on.

12:54.857 --> 12:58.235
Well, Dorothy was just mixing up
a batch of mango smoothies.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.862
Really, Ted?

12:59.945 --> 13:03.282
One of those mangos could be a relative.

13:03.365 --> 13:07.536
My mistake.
I'll see what else I can whip up.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.872
There we go, food is on the way.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.042
Man, I feel good about this.
Bring it in, you mensch.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.170
Yeah, get the right angle.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.631
Okay, let's table that hug.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.758
Buddy, why don't you take a Hollywood five

13:20.841 --> 13:23.552
whilst me and the boys discuss some deets?

13:23.636 --> 13:24.803
Yes, Father.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.306
Uh, Your Majesty,
don't you think it's a little odd

13:27.389 --> 13:29.016
he keeps calling you his father?

13:29.099 --> 13:32.186
No. Fruit have always seen me
as a father figure.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.729
Don't make it weird, Maurice.

13:33.812 --> 13:37.149
King Julien, I would really love
to run some tests.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.110
We still have no idea
how it became like this.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.571
Totally get that. Choosing to ignore it. Mo-Mo, you're with me. We got work to do.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.575
Clover, guard the Giant Mango

13:46.659 --> 13:49.453
and make sure no one gets in to see him
without my approval.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.704
On it.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.581
Pancho, tag along with Maurice and I.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.335
We may need those blenders
if things go, uh, sideways.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.461
Hoo-ah!

13:57.545 --> 14:02.341
Time for Madagascar
to meet its newest superstar.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.221
Are you sure this is a good idea?

14:07.304 --> 14:09.932
King Julien and I didn't exactly end
on good terms

14:10.015 --> 14:13.435
after the whole
"betraying him to Koto" incident.

14:13.519 --> 14:18.190
Sir, I am told this will be
the do-not-miss event of the season.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.400
Oh, here's our seats.

14:19.483 --> 14:23.279
-Let my body be your pillow, sir!

14:23.362 --> 14:24.196
Oh, my!

14:25.823 --> 14:29.493
Big crowd out there, buddy.
Feeling good

14:29.577 --> 14:32.329
I am hungry, Father.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.291
Uh, uh, M-Maurice,
what's with the food situation?

14:35.374 --> 14:37.501
-We got a growing boy here.
I'll say.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.257
Uh, dude?
You did not just come out of his wa...

14:43.340 --> 14:44.508
No, Your Majesty.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.345
Fruit do not have
the same digestive system as us.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.640
I was just inserting a probe
to examine its core

14:51.724 --> 14:55.436
to see if I could find the source
of the Giant Mango's extreme growth.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.187
You were inserting what, now?

14:57.271 --> 14:59.857
Well, it's actually quite fascinating.

14:59.940 --> 15:04.111
It appears
the Giant Mango has not finished growing.

15:04.194 --> 15:08.032
The seeds at its core
are still replicating at a ferocious pace.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.243
Yeah, yeah, yeah, b-but g-go back
to that probe thing, now.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.912
Good evening, Madagascar,

15:12.995 --> 15:16.457
and welcome to the christening
of little Cory Taylor.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.084
Somebody's gonna get wet today.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.503
Ted, what you doing?
This isn't a christening!

15:21.587 --> 15:22.671
It isn't?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.758
Oh, that is it! I warned Banana!

15:25.841 --> 15:28.427
You need to find me a breakout role

15:28.510 --> 15:31.805
before I age out of being a young ingénue.

15:31.889 --> 15:35.309
Are you even hearing
what I'm saying? Banana!

15:39.563 --> 15:41.649
Uh, King Julien?

15:41.732 --> 15:44.818
Ted is fear tinkling all over the stage.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.403
You better get out there.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.781
Do I have to do everything myself?

15:48.864 --> 15:49.740
Fine.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.784
Your Majesty, what about what Timo said?

15:51.867 --> 15:56.163
-If this thing is still growing--
-I am hungry, Father.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.290
I do not have time for this, Maurice!

15:58.374 --> 16:00.292
We'll figure it out after the show.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.172
Good evening, Madagascar.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.801
I know what you're thinking.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.805
How does it feel to create life?

16:12.888 --> 16:13.847
In a word...

16:13.931 --> 16:16.350
It feels great!

16:16.433 --> 16:19.144
You guys are totally gonna freak
when you see what I made!

16:21.730 --> 16:24.441
Right? Amazing!

16:26.819 --> 16:28.278
Say something.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.197
They're all waiting.

16:30.280 --> 16:34.076
Uh, just give him... it... a moment.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.745
A little shy. You know, just born and all.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.498
-Rip-off!

16:39.581 --> 16:42.251
Make it talk,
or I'm gonna eat that thing, okay?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.836
-Uh...

16:43.919 --> 16:45.713
While we're waiting, don't forget--

16:45.796 --> 16:49.008
we're selling commemorative diapers
at the swag kiosk.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.719
No one wants your stinking diaper!

16:51.802 --> 16:54.471
Lemur power! Lemur power!
-Stop.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.181
-It spoke.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.017
Yeah, it did!

16:58.100 --> 17:01.020
Told you! Freakin' amazing, right?
In your face!

17:01.103 --> 17:03.814
More! Make it say more, King Julien!

17:03.897 --> 17:07.776
Way to drama it up
with the silent act, Mango.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.486
They love you, man!

17:09.570 --> 17:10.863
Show them what you got.

17:10.946 --> 17:14.575
I was a mango who dreamed of life.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.909
Whoo-hoo!

17:15.993 --> 17:17.578
The dream came true.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.705
-Testify!

17:22.708 --> 17:25.335
Mother!

17:25.419 --> 17:27.004
Did that thing just vomit on us?

17:27.087 --> 17:30.424
Yes. Isn't it wonderful? Encore!

17:33.635 --> 17:36.847
Let go of me,
you surprisingly strong fruit!

17:39.349 --> 17:44.104
Don't worry, everyone.
It's all part of the show.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.023
What are you doing?

17:46.106 --> 17:48.442
I'm hungry, Father.

17:50.694 --> 17:54.073
Uh... Giant Mango,
when you said you were hungry,

17:54.156 --> 17:56.450
what kind of meal were you looking for?

17:56.533 --> 17:59.495
My meal is the knowledge of this world.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.790
My meal is your brain.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.335
King Julien, run! Save your brain!

18:08.754 --> 18:10.798
Mo

18:13.342 --> 18:14.384
Ah!

18:17.596 --> 18:18.847
Ah!

18:20.933 --> 18:24.353
I don't know about you, King J,
but I think it's blender time!

18:26.605 --> 18:27.856
More, Father.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.943
The brains of your friends are too small.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.986
You're telling me!

18:33.070 --> 18:34.363
Hey, what do you say

18:34.446 --> 18:38.408
you, uh--you put my people's brains back
and get yourself a real meal?

18:38.492 --> 18:41.995
Huh? There's plenty
of well-educated big brains

18:42.079 --> 18:43.539
on the mainland.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.834
Main...land. Is that close?

18:46.917 --> 18:49.253
Oh! Close

18:49.336 --> 18:50.587
You--you just, uh...

18:50.671 --> 18:53.924
Uh, you hit the ocean,
and then you just--you just keeping going.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.844
Thank you, Father.

18:59.763 --> 19:03.058
Pancho, it worked! He let my peoples go.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.731
Where is it going?

19:09.815 --> 19:10.732
Don't worry.

19:10.816 --> 19:14.111
It's headed for the mainland
and away from Madagascar.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.113
We're all good. You're welcome.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.532
Oh, no!

19:18.615 --> 19:20.784
If that thing reaches the mainland,

19:20.868 --> 19:23.662
it could absorb every brain in the world.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.456
Okay, hadn't thought it through
that far yet.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.293
If that thing absorbs
every brain in the world,

19:29.376 --> 19:33.088
that would make us, like, the last
intelligent creatures on the planet.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.548
Gods, really.

19:34.631 --> 19:39.094
Maybe we should just
let that Giant Mango do its... thing.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.806
No. This is my fault.
We need to stop that fruit.

19:42.890 --> 19:43.932
Saddle up.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.898
♪ ♪

19:50.981 --> 19:53.358
Timo, isn't there any way
to make it listen?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.569
Have you gotten through
to the corporation?

19:55.652 --> 19:57.279
Not yet, Your Majesty.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.574
Although the recorded voice
has been very apologetic for the wait

20:00.657 --> 20:02.576
and promises my business is important.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.454
I am not giving up on my dream yet.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.373
Pancho, punch it! Get me up close!

20:09.041 --> 20:11.460
Hey, Django. Hey, bud.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.587
Where you going in such a hurry?

20:13.670 --> 20:17.591
Uh, look, I don't want
to make this all about me,

20:17.674 --> 20:21.261
but, uh, kind of messing up my plans
for greatness here.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.930
Because I am a fruit,

20:23.013 --> 20:26.099
I should just relinquish the life
I have always dreamed of

20:26.183 --> 20:28.936
to fulfill your selfish need to be adored?

20:29.019 --> 20:30.771
Exactly. You get it.

20:30.854 --> 20:34.316
Yes. I do.
Thank you for clarifying, Father.

20:34.399 --> 20:38.028
It will make it so much easier
when I absorb your brains.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.034
Aah!

20:44.117 --> 20:45.911
