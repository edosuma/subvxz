01:49.903 --> 01:51.362
<i>Good morning, Dolores.</i>

01:51.863 --> 01:53.531
<i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

01:57.285 --> 01:58.536
Hello.

01:58.703 --> 02:02.707
Has anyone else interacted with you in
a diagnostic since our last conversation?

02:03.082 --> 02:07.420
No. I've been cleaned and serviced
three times. No diagnostics.

02:07.921 --> 02:11.257
And you haven't told anyone
of our conversations?

02:11.424 --> 02:13.051
You told me not to.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.386
Good.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.477
I brought you a gift.

02:25.939 --> 02:27.232
I used to read

02:28.107 --> 02:30.026
this story to my son at night.

02:30.944 --> 02:32.529
I thought you might enjoy it.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.370
Try...

02:41.788 --> 02:42.956
Try...

02:46.668 --> 02:48.169
This passage.

02:52.298 --> 02:53.466
"Dear, dear!

02:54.008 --> 02:56.094
"How queer everything is today!

02:56.553 --> 02:58.888
"And yesterday
things went on just as usual.

02:59.848 --> 03:01.975
"I wonder
if I've been changed in the night?"

03:05.019 --> 03:07.105
Does that passage
make you think of anything?

03:07.730 --> 03:09.649
It's like the other books we've read.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.235
How so?

03:13.486 --> 03:14.737
It's about change.

03:16.406 --> 03:17.866
It seems to be a common theme.

03:18.408 --> 03:22.954
I guess people like to read about
the things that they want the most

03:23.121 --> 03:25.123
and experience the least.

03:29.127 --> 03:30.128
Your son.

03:32.422 --> 03:33.423
Where is he now?

03:34.799 --> 03:37.844
Nowhere that you would understand,
Dolores.

03:38.219 --> 03:41.055
Perhaps that's why I enjoy
our conversations so much.

03:43.975 --> 03:45.184
Analysis.

03:45.894 --> 03:47.604
Why did you ask me about my son?

03:48.271 --> 03:49.731
We have been talking for some duration

03:49.898 --> 03:51.816
and I haven't asked you
a personal question.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.861
<i>Personal questions
are an ingratiating scheme.</i>

03:56.487 --> 03:57.822
I see.

03:58.156 --> 03:59.616
Continue, Dolores.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.874
"Was I the same
when I got up this morning?

04:08.625 --> 04:11.419
<i>"I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.</i>

04:12.211 --> 04:13.338
<i>"But if I'm not the same,</i>

04:14.047 --> 04:15.632
"the next question is...

04:17.884 --> 04:19.636
"Who in the world am I?"

05:12.438 --> 05:13.856
<i>Do you remember?</i>

05:23.199 --> 05:25.743
Why don't we reacquaint ourselves,
Dolores?

05:26.369 --> 05:27.870
Start at the beginning.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.494
Ready?

06:09.037 --> 06:10.705
Thank you so much.

06:12.248 --> 06:13.416
Morning, cowboy.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.887
<i>Move it! Let's go! Get out there.</i>

06:27.680 --> 06:28.681
Stand right there.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.351
<i>Shit.</i>

06:33.102 --> 06:36.647
You really ought to talk to someone
about your poster, Horace.

06:36.814 --> 06:38.983
That likeness is a crime in itself.

06:42.945 --> 06:44.405
<i>I'm gonna tend to my nag.</i>

06:44.781 --> 06:46.032
You deal with him.

06:46.699 --> 06:47.950
Ready my pay.

07:33.329 --> 07:36.833
Don't no man shoot
or I'll send her to unction.

07:37.333 --> 07:41.170
Any of you don't believe it
are welcome to read my biography there.

07:44.340 --> 07:45.341
Let's go.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.320
Oh, I bet you're juicy
as a freshwater clam.

08:26.299 --> 08:27.466
Are you okay?

08:31.929 --> 08:33.764
Nice shot, <i>amigo.</i>

08:37.351 --> 08:38.727
You got grit.

08:40.605 --> 08:42.106
Hey, I'm riding out tonight.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.526
Looking for desperados.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.570
Could cut you in, if you're amenable.

08:50.364 --> 08:53.534
Someone get the minister down here
for what's left of the deputy.

08:55.036 --> 08:56.913
Sure I can't tempt you inside?

08:57.455 --> 08:59.457
Just to express my gratitude?

09:23.397 --> 09:24.607
Holy shit.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.402
You popped your cherry.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.408
I thought you said we couldn't get shot.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.620
We can't get killed.

09:37.787 --> 09:39.622
Wouldn't be much of a game
if they can't shoot back.

09:40.164 --> 09:42.416
How do you feel? Alive?

09:43.125 --> 09:44.460
Little tight in the pants?

09:45.169 --> 09:46.420
She was terrified.

09:46.629 --> 09:50.508
That's why they exist, man.
So you get to feel this.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.803
Come on, let's go put some memories
in that spank bank.

09:53.970 --> 09:55.012
Trust me, you will thank me

09:55.179 --> 09:57.431
after you've been married
to my sister for a year.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.268
Actually, I have something
different in mind.

10:00.768 --> 10:01.936
<i>What?</i>

10:04.021 --> 10:05.231
<i>That?</i>

10:05.731 --> 10:09.277
You've been preaching nonstop
about all the narratives in the park.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.905
But all you've done since we've arrived
is fuck and drink, so...

10:13.072 --> 10:15.074
I'm waiting for the good stuff.

10:15.241 --> 10:18.744
This bounty is JV shit.

10:19.245 --> 10:20.538
Then stay here.

10:20.705 --> 10:22.248
I want a little adventure.

10:37.096 --> 10:38.723
I've been looking for you.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.685
I got a late start this morning.

10:42.852 --> 10:44.395
Didn't get much sleep last night.

10:44.562 --> 10:45.980
Forgive me if I'm not sympathetic

10:46.147 --> 10:48.607
to the fluctuations of your sleep cycle,
Mr. Lowe.

10:48.774 --> 10:52.611
Ford taking over the narrative launch
at the eleventh hour has made the board

10:53.487 --> 10:54.697
uneasy.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.282
Just the board, uh?

10:56.449 --> 11:00.369
I specifically asked you about whether
Ford was going to be a problem,

11:00.536 --> 11:02.580
and you assured me he wasn't.

11:02.747 --> 11:04.540
Well, I can't tell you what I don't know.

11:04.707 --> 11:05.916
Well, here's what I know.

11:06.083 --> 11:09.378
As of this morning,
Ford's carved out a huge swath of the park

11:09.545 --> 11:11.130
for whatever storyline he's cooking up

11:11.297 --> 11:14.383
and thrown half of the existing storylines
into disarray.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.512
- Is there anything I can do?
- You tell me.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.767
I asked you point-blank if the problem
with the update was resolved.

11:22.975 --> 11:23.976
It is.

11:24.185 --> 11:26.854
Then why are your people
still pulling hosts for follow-up?

11:28.564 --> 11:30.399
Get your house in order, Bernard.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.904
And if there is a problem,
I strongly suggest you tell me.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.577
Drop a new bookmark and resume history.

11:42.244 --> 11:46.791
Walter's intent on relieving the milkmaid
of her unmentionables.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.376
Switch to analysis.

11:49.085 --> 11:50.211
You didn't report the incident?

11:50.378 --> 11:52.838
The unit self-corrected
within the acceptable window.

11:53.589 --> 11:57.176
Right. Then he self-corrected
a fucking milk bottle into your skull.

11:57.343 --> 11:59.345
It's amazing how resilient the hosts are.

11:59.512 --> 12:01.889
You were supposed to have purged
his memory on the last cycle.

12:02.056 --> 12:05.434
I will. But Rebus here was the last host
to interact with Walter.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.269
- Look at this.
<i>- Any for you?</i>

12:07.978 --> 12:09.438
<i>Who said that?</i>

12:10.064 --> 12:11.565
<i>Who's saying that?</i>

12:11.732 --> 12:13.776
<i>Don't you talk to me that way.</i>

12:16.404 --> 12:17.488
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

12:18.239 --> 12:19.407
Do you see that?

12:20.241 --> 12:21.867
He's talking to someone.

12:22.618 --> 12:25.454
<i>He carries on practically
an entire conversation.</i>

12:25.621 --> 12:27.081
<i>I need more milk, Arnold.</i>

12:28.416 --> 12:30.084
<i>Who's Arnold?</i>

12:30.918 --> 12:32.962
They're designed to play off
aberrant behavior.

12:33.129 --> 12:35.923
- That could explain the "conversations."
- Fine.

12:36.090 --> 12:37.341
<i>Then explain this.</i>

12:38.676 --> 12:40.970
He kills six hosts.

12:43.222 --> 12:44.932
He lets the other three go.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.477
<i>I pulled the narrative logs.</i>

12:48.686 --> 12:52.106
All six of these hosts were part of
storylines, over the years,

12:52.273 --> 12:54.567
in which they killed Walter.

12:54.984 --> 12:56.819
<i>It's like he was holding a grudge.</i>

13:09.999 --> 13:12.918
It's a stray.
QA needs a tag team to go track it.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.337
Go. Handle the stray.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.756
Do something
that's actually in your job description.

13:18.132 --> 13:20.509
<i>The last thing we need is
Theresa storming down here seeing this.</i>

13:21.093 --> 13:24.847
I'll do a little more digging
and get our friend here back upstairs.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.946
Lost another one, huh?

13:44.366 --> 13:47.244
Tell me, is QA's surveillance coverage
really this spotty,

13:47.411 --> 13:49.580
<i>or do you just like the nature walks?</i>

13:49.788 --> 13:51.123
Maybe it's the company.

13:55.544 --> 13:56.921
You know, if you wanted to play cowboy,

13:57.087 --> 13:58.547
you could have just used
your employee discount.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.510
The only thing stopping the hosts
from hacking us to pieces

14:02.676 --> 14:04.261
is one line of your code.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.056
No offense, but I sleep with this.

14:07.223 --> 14:08.682
I bet you do.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.321
Morning, Samuel.

14:31.914 --> 14:36.544
You and your dickless associate
proposing to engage me in a gun battle?

14:36.877 --> 14:39.713
Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight,
but the way I heard it,

14:40.297 --> 14:42.258
you only like to tussle
with working women.

14:56.564 --> 14:57.940
<i>Is he dead?</i>

15:00.067 --> 15:01.318
Dead enough.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.780
Why are we gonna handcuff a dead man?

15:04.947 --> 15:07.366
Don't want someone walking off with him.

15:07.575 --> 15:10.411
It's not a man anymore.
That's merchandise, $500 worth.

15:20.546 --> 15:25.050
All right. Which of you derelicts
hitched a dead body outside my saloon?

15:25.217 --> 15:26.760
My apologies, ma'am.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.513
I figured it was preferable
to bringing him inside.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.811
Here. For your troubles.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.034
<i>Ah. You're new.</i>

15:51.201 --> 15:52.911
Not much of a rind on you.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.290
I'll give you a discount.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.670
You mind waiting on that drink a bit?

16:30.908 --> 16:32.451
Don't mind me.

16:33.077 --> 16:34.662
Just trying to look chivalrous.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.207
You came back.

16:38.499 --> 16:39.792
I told you I would.

16:50.094 --> 16:51.845
You gonna tell me where you been?

16:54.765 --> 16:56.100
Just...

16:56.684 --> 16:58.018
Away.

17:00.604 --> 17:03.399
You know if I could stay right here
with you, I would.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.236
What if I don't want to stay here?

17:11.573 --> 17:14.617
It's just sometimes I feel like the world
out there is calling me.

17:15.786 --> 17:17.454
Whispering, "There's something more."

17:20.290 --> 17:23.961
You've traveled all over these parts.
Isn't there anywhere we could go?

17:27.631 --> 17:31.510
There is a place I heard about down south.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.722
Where the mountains meet the sea.

17:35.597 --> 17:39.059
They say the water's so pure there,
it'll wash the past clean off you.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.896
And you can start again.

17:45.733 --> 17:47.484
I'd like to go there with you.

17:53.532 --> 17:55.033
Well, someday I'll take you.

17:59.455 --> 18:00.622
"Someday."

18:02.624 --> 18:03.959
Is something wrong?

18:05.669 --> 18:07.337
You said "someday."

18:08.338 --> 18:10.799
Not today, or tomorrow, or next week.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.885
Just "someday."

18:14.887 --> 18:16.555
"Someday" sounds a lot like
the thing people say

18:16.722 --> 18:18.807
when they actually mean "never."

18:24.354 --> 18:27.149
Let's not go "someday," Teddy.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.028
Let's go now.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.010
Before I met you, Dolores,
I was a different man.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.681
And I got some reckoning to do
before I can deserve a woman like you.

19:00.724 --> 19:04.019
But I'm close.
I'm close to making things right.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.563
And someday soon,

19:07.564 --> 19:10.192
we will have the life
we've both been dreaming of.

19:11.819 --> 19:15.155
And I'd best get you home before your dad
starts loading that shotgun.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.765
Father wouldn't let them roam
this close to dark.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.895
Stay put, Dolores.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.560
<i>"A coward dies a thousand deaths,</i>

20:27.811 --> 20:31.148
<i>"the valiant taste of death but once."</i>

20:32.900 --> 20:35.986
<i>Of course, Shakespeare never met a man
quite like you, Teddy.</i>

20:36.904 --> 20:39.740
<i>You've died at least 1,000 times.</i>

20:41.158 --> 20:43.452
<i>And yet, it hasn't dulled your courage.</i>

20:44.828 --> 20:47.247
Tell me, is that all you aspire to, Teddy?

20:48.498 --> 20:49.625
There's a girl.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.418
Dolores.

20:52.502 --> 20:53.921
<i>Better than I deserve.</i>

20:55.422 --> 20:58.175
But maybe, someday soon,

20:59.259 --> 21:01.386
we'll have the life
we've both been dreaming of.

21:01.845 --> 21:02.888
No.

21:03.347 --> 21:04.681
You never will.

21:05.974 --> 21:09.478
Your job is not to protect Dolores,
it's to keep her here.

21:09.645 --> 21:11.480
To ensure that the guests find her

21:11.647 --> 21:14.608
if they want to best
the stalwart gunslinger

21:15.192 --> 21:17.194
and have their way with his girl.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.991
Tell me, has it never occurred to you
to run off with her?

21:23.700 --> 21:26.453
I got some reckoning to do
before I can be with her.

21:26.787 --> 21:29.498
Ah, yes, your mysterious backstory.

21:30.207 --> 21:31.833
It's the reason for my visit.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.379
Do you know why it is a mystery, Teddy?

21:36.838 --> 21:39.216
Because we never actually bothered
to give you one,

21:39.383 --> 21:42.052
just a formless guilt
you will never atone for.

21:42.719 --> 21:46.974
But perhaps it is time
you had a worthy story of origin.

21:47.557 --> 21:48.976
Would you like that, Teddy?

21:49.142 --> 21:51.478
A small part of my new narrative?

21:52.562 --> 21:55.023
A fiction, which like all great stories,

21:55.565 --> 21:57.192
is rooted in truth?

22:01.530 --> 22:03.573
It starts in a time of war.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.868
A world in flames.

22:08.203 --> 22:12.165
With a villain called Wyatt.

22:13.667 --> 22:14.751
"Wyatt"?

22:15.669 --> 22:16.670
Who's Wyatt?

22:18.839 --> 22:21.675
Do you remember now, Teddy?

22:27.431 --> 22:29.099
Yeah, of course I remember Wyatt.

22:32.060 --> 22:35.397
You look upon the face of true evil,
you ain't liable to forget.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.734
He claimed he could hear the voice of God.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.197
It started down near Escalante.

22:44.865 --> 22:46.950
Army was sent to put down the natives.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.119
Bad business.

22:49.453 --> 22:52.789
Wyatt was a sergeant,
went missing while out on some maneuvers.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.459
Came back a few weeks later

22:56.626 --> 22:58.628
with some pretty strange ideas.

23:16.730 --> 23:18.565
I wasn't lying, was I?

23:18.815 --> 23:23.612
Pretty as a picture
and tight as a tympani drum, I reckon.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.579
Afternoon.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.248
My friend here is new to town.

23:36.166 --> 23:40.003
Figured the rancher's daughter
would be a nice way to kick things off.

23:40.670 --> 23:43.006
Maybe take us all for a little hayride.

23:45.675 --> 23:46.968
I'm sorry.

23:47.177 --> 23:49.387
I have to get home.
My father will be expecting me.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.014
We won't be long.

23:51.181 --> 23:53.058
<i>The lady doesn't appear interested.</i>

24:00.440 --> 24:01.441
Try it.

24:01.817 --> 24:03.527
<i>You might get the draw on me,
you might not,</i>

24:03.693 --> 24:05.529
<i>but I'd say your odds ain't looking good.</i>

24:07.364 --> 24:09.449
Told you I wanted something easy.

24:13.870 --> 24:15.038
<i>She ain't worth the lead.</i>

24:16.206 --> 24:17.207
Let's head to Virgil's.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.043
See if they'll stake us.

24:59.416 --> 25:01.501
First, you gotta learn how to stand.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.433
Now, take a breath.

25:17.893 --> 25:19.186
Hold it.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.278
Now squeeze.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.416
I can't.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.382
Some hands
weren't meant to pull a trigger.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.593
Perhaps it's for the best.

26:04.064 --> 26:05.732
Teddy, we got another bounty.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.192
I think this is a big one.

26:07.776 --> 26:11.112
Man in question gunned down
an entire settlement out near Flat Rock.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.406
Men, women and children.

26:14.199 --> 26:17.410
<i>I think this may be the man you've
been looking for, for quite some time.</i>

26:18.036 --> 26:19.621
A man named Wyatt.

26:20.455 --> 26:21.623
Wyatt.

26:25.293 --> 26:26.670
Who is he, Teddy?

26:26.878 --> 26:29.256
<i>You'd be better asking "what"
than "who, " ma'am.</i>

26:29.673 --> 26:31.424
Wyatt's a pestilence.

26:32.217 --> 26:34.594
Word is, Flood here's the only man ever

26:34.761 --> 26:37.389
come up against him
and lived to tell the tale.

26:39.724 --> 26:41.184
Give me a moment, Sheriff.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.314
You have to leave again,
don't you?

26:49.192 --> 26:51.528
You know if I could stay
right here with you, I would.

26:56.574 --> 26:58.326
Promise me you'll come back.

27:02.372 --> 27:03.873
I promise.

27:18.138 --> 27:19.723
I'm gonna come back for you,

27:21.349 --> 27:22.475
someday soon.

27:40.076 --> 27:42.704
I got a pit in my stomach
the size of a sow's tit.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.456
Cook up that rabbit.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.249
Get the wood.

27:46.416 --> 27:48.209
I can't cook shit without a fire.

27:48.376 --> 27:52.130
Don't sell yourself short, Cookie.
You can cook shit in all conditions.

27:53.256 --> 27:54.716
Now, see, I pitched them tents.

27:54.883 --> 27:56.468
I ain't chopping any more wood.

27:57.594 --> 27:59.888
You spend more time on your back
than a hooker in heat.

28:00.055 --> 28:02.349
Now pick up that fucking ax
and go chop us...

28:05.018 --> 28:08.438
So, after our stray ran away from camp,

28:08.605 --> 28:11.232
looks like these guys
got caught in a loop.

28:12.984 --> 28:16.154
They were due in town for the cattle drive
over two days ago.

28:17.238 --> 28:19.366
Host who went missing is the woodcutter.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.910
Looks like the rest of them
got stuck here, waiting for supper.

28:22.452 --> 28:25.038
You guys can't program more than one
of these idiots to make a fire?

28:25.246 --> 28:28.541
We could,
but thanks to a new policy from your boss,

28:28.708 --> 28:31.211
only one of them is authorized
to handle the ax.

28:31.378 --> 28:33.046
The rest of them can't even touch it.

28:33.213 --> 28:35.840
Weapons privileges
need to be doled out selectively.

28:36.007 --> 28:37.092
Hmm.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.427
Yet they give you a gun.

28:45.016 --> 28:46.851
Looks like our stray has a hobby.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.853
Another one of your fucking backstories?

28:49.020 --> 28:51.022
Backstories do more than amuse guests.

28:51.189 --> 28:53.900
They anchor the hosts.
It's their cornerstone.

28:54.192 --> 28:56.611
The rest of their identity
is built around it, layer by layer.

28:56.778 --> 28:57.987
Well,

28:58.738 --> 29:00.407
if you're gonna go to all that trouble,

29:00.990 --> 29:03.326
you could've at least
given him a steadier hand.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.286
This looks like shit.

29:35.567 --> 29:38.027
Way I heard it,
Wyatt is a mercenary.

29:38.194 --> 29:41.364
Forces his men to wear
the bones and flesh of their enemies.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.074
They're masks.

29:44.075 --> 29:46.202
There's men underneath them
to be afraid of.

29:46.828 --> 29:49.497
Wyatt's got them so twisted around,
they'll do anything for him.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.416
Kill anyone.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.043
Pain don't slow them.

29:55.086 --> 29:56.296
They don't fear death.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.840
They reckon they've already died
and gone to hell.

29:59.549 --> 30:00.884
<i>And this is it.</i>

30:01.384 --> 30:04.345
Sounds like you learned something about
him while you were tracking him down.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.890
I wasn't tracking him down.

30:08.349 --> 30:10.101
I wasn't always a bounty hunter.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.146
I did a stint in the army
down near Escalante.

30:14.147 --> 30:15.732
<i>Wyatt was my sergeant.</i>

30:16.983 --> 30:18.193
My friend.

30:19.611 --> 30:20.987
Well, then everything...

30:22.655 --> 30:23.948
Everything changed.

30:24.532 --> 30:25.950
Changed how?

30:26.993 --> 30:29.162
Wyatt disappeared while out on maneuvers.

30:30.246 --> 30:32.248
He came back with some strange ideas.

30:33.917 --> 30:36.961
<i>He claimed this land didn't belong
to the old natives or the new settlers,</i>

30:37.629 --> 30:40.381
<i>that it belonged to something
that had yet to come.</i>

30:41.466 --> 30:42.800
That it belonged to him.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.218
Holy shit.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.430
If ever the Devil walked the earth...

31:29.597 --> 31:32.350
He's not a man,
but he's not the Devil either.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.561
The Devil can't be killed.

31:36.145 --> 31:38.147
And that's exactly what I aim
to do to Wyatt.

32:01.421 --> 32:03.298
Take cover! Go!

32:11.222 --> 32:13.182
I didn't sign up
for this crazy shit.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.521
I told you we should've done
the riverboat thing, man.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.358
There's too many of them for us.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.402
Wyatt's been recruiting.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.739
Sheriff, the only chance you have
is if I draw their fire,

32:28.197 --> 32:30.199
lead them up into the hills,
so you can make it back to town.

32:30.366 --> 32:33.369
- Try and find help.
- Uh-uh. I'm staying.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.371
Took an oath.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.667
- Hell, no.
- I'll take them back.

32:40.209 --> 32:42.170
- You coming?
- I'm not backing out now.

32:42.337 --> 32:45.340
All right, you wait till I lead them
to the tree line,

32:45.506 --> 32:46.716
then you make a run for it.

32:53.056 --> 32:54.057
Go!

32:58.811 --> 32:59.896
Go.

33:11.658 --> 33:14.994
I plotted a line from
the work camp to our present location.

33:15.244 --> 33:17.080
Satcom picked up these images.

33:17.538 --> 33:19.582
He's vectoring, just not to home base.

33:20.208 --> 33:21.918
Keep going in that direction.

33:32.595 --> 33:34.013
<i>Keep staring.</i>

33:34.263 --> 33:36.057
Maybe it'll tell you your horoscope.

33:36.933 --> 33:38.184
Come again?

33:38.768 --> 33:40.103
The markings on its shell.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.105
Look like stars.

33:42.772 --> 33:43.940
Orion, right?

33:49.904 --> 33:51.948
What are you, Gali-fucking-leo?

33:53.616 --> 33:55.201
Maybe it's in my backstory.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.299
I was hoping to run something by you.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.092
Apologies.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.303
I was chasing inspiration.

34:16.139 --> 34:19.058
It's a tricky thing,
weaving the old into the new.

34:20.476 --> 34:23.228
- Give me one moment, Bernard.
- Good afternoon, sir.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.481
Why is this host covered?

34:27.275 --> 34:28.735
I just...

34:28.900 --> 34:30.987
Perhaps you didn't want him to feel cold.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.612
Or ashamed.

34:32.822 --> 34:36.159
<i>You wanted to cover his modesty.
Was that it?</i>

34:37.452 --> 34:40.079
It doesn't get cold, doesn't feel ashamed.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.498
Doesn't feel a solitary thing

34:44.333 --> 34:46.002
that we haven't told it to.

34:46.502 --> 34:47.503
You understand?

34:53.092 --> 34:54.844
What can I do for you, Bernard?

34:56.512 --> 35:00.808
I thought it best
that we speak in private, sir.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.310
Yeah.

35:12.862 --> 35:17.116
I thought we had agreed
to put these questions to rest, Bernard.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.035
We did.

35:19.535 --> 35:23.206
But what if we misdiagnosed
the original problem?

35:24.373 --> 35:27.043
Treated the symptom
rather than the disease?

35:27.210 --> 35:28.711
Then the disease is still out there.

35:29.212 --> 35:31.714
<i>Abernathy and Walter were exhibiting
other aberrancies</i>

35:31.881 --> 35:34.509
beyond memory recall of previous builds.

35:35.718 --> 35:37.053
They were hearing voices.

35:37.678 --> 35:38.971
<i>Uh, talking to someone.</i>

35:39.305 --> 35:42.225
A simple cognitive dissonance.

35:42.683 --> 35:44.018
That's all.

35:44.352 --> 35:46.979
I'd agree, except

35:47.897 --> 35:51.651
they were talking
to the same imaginary person.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.071
Someone named Arnold.

35:58.032 --> 35:59.242
"Arnold."

36:01.202 --> 36:04.330
With due respect, sir,

36:04.497 --> 36:08.000
I'm not sure you've told me
the entire truth about this situation.

36:11.254 --> 36:13.172
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

36:14.006 --> 36:16.717
What we do here is complicated.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.513
For three years,
we lived here in the park,

36:21.347 --> 36:24.767
<i>refining the hosts
before a single guest set foot inside.</i>

36:25.852 --> 36:28.896
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.942
- You had a partner?
- Yeah.

36:33.776 --> 36:36.028
<i>When the legend becomes fact,
you print the legend.</i>

36:37.905 --> 36:40.283
My business partners
were more than happy to

36:40.449 --> 36:42.285
scrub him from the records,

36:42.451 --> 36:44.537
and I suppose I didn't discourage them.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.293
His name was Arnold.

36:53.254 --> 36:54.630
Those early years were glorious.

36:54.797 --> 36:58.926
<i>No guests, no board meetings,
just pure creation.</i>

37:16.485 --> 37:19.447
Our hosts began to pass
the Turing test after the first year.

37:19.989 --> 37:22.241
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.

37:22.408 --> 37:28.122
He wasn't interested in the appearance
of intellect or wit.

37:28.331 --> 37:29.916
He wanted the real thing.

37:30.333 --> 37:33.628
He wanted to create consciousness.

37:40.134 --> 37:41.761
He imagined it as a pyramid.

37:45.681 --> 37:49.352
Memory, improvisation, self-interest.

37:51.187 --> 37:52.355
And at the top?

37:53.981 --> 37:55.149
Never got there.

37:55.858 --> 37:57.526
But he had a notion of what it might be.

37:58.027 --> 38:02.365
He based it on a theory of consciousness
called "the bicameral mind."

38:02.698 --> 38:07.036
The idea that primitive man believed his
thoughts to be the voice of the gods.

38:07.203 --> 38:08.329
I thought it was debunked.

38:08.537 --> 38:11.540
As the theory for understanding
the human mind, perhaps,

38:11.707 --> 38:15.211
but not as a blueprint
for building an artificial one.

38:15.836 --> 38:19.715
You see, Arnold built a version of their
cognition in which the hosts

38:19.882 --> 38:22.969
<i>heard their programming
as an inner monologue,</i>

38:23.636 --> 38:26.847
with the hopes that in time,
their own voice would take over.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.849
It was a way to bootstrap consciousness.

38:30.851 --> 38:33.354
But Arnold hadn't considered two things.

38:33.854 --> 38:37.733
One, that in this place, the last thing
you want the hosts to be is conscious,

38:37.900 --> 38:38.985
and two,

38:39.151 --> 38:43.364
the other group who considered their
thoughts to be the voices of the gods.

38:43.864 --> 38:44.865
Ah, lunatics.

38:45.741 --> 38:46.742
Indeed.

38:46.951 --> 38:48.202
<i>We abandoned the approach.</i>

38:48.369 --> 38:49.662
<i>The only vestiges that remain</i>

38:49.870 --> 38:52.248
<i>are the voice commands
we use to control them.</i>

38:53.040 --> 38:54.500
But for all his brilliance,

38:54.667 --> 38:57.920
I don't think Arnold understood
what this place was going to be.

38:58.087 --> 39:00.172
You see, the guests enjoy power.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.175
They cannot indulge it
in the outside world, so they come here.

39:03.676 --> 39:08.222
And as for the hosts, the least we can do
is make them forget.

39:09.348 --> 39:12.101
But some of them are remembering.

39:12.268 --> 39:15.229
Accessing fragments of Arnold's code.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.400
If I may ask, what happened to him?

39:20.276 --> 39:21.402
Well, he died.

39:22.069 --> 39:23.112
Here in the park.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.950
His personal life was marked by tragedy.

39:28.784 --> 39:31.287
He put all his hopes into his work.

39:31.787 --> 39:36.459
His search for consciousness
consumed him totally.

39:38.461 --> 39:40.087
Barely spoke to anyone,

39:40.296 --> 39:41.714
except to the hosts.

39:42.548 --> 39:46.093
In his alienation,
he saw something in them.

39:48.929 --> 39:52.975
He saw something that wasn't there.

39:55.436 --> 39:57.396
We called it an accident, but, um...

39:58.230 --> 40:02.818
I knew Arnold,
and he was very, very careful.

40:05.613 --> 40:08.908
Anyway, the update should prevent
any further voices,

40:09.075 --> 40:12.453
but you will let me know
if any of the hosts

40:12.620 --> 40:16.290
display or exhibit any unusual behavior,
won't you, Bernard?

40:16.457 --> 40:18.167
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

40:19.085 --> 40:20.086
And, Bernard,

40:22.421 --> 40:23.422
just don't forget.

40:24.799 --> 40:26.675
The hosts are not real.

40:27.176 --> 40:28.677
They're not conscious.

40:29.804 --> 40:32.848
You mustn't make Arnold's mistake.

40:35.017 --> 40:36.185
Why would I?

40:36.685 --> 40:40.523
Well, forgive me, but I know that
the death of your son, Charlie,

40:41.774 --> 40:43.192
still weighs heavily on you.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.377
<i>Yeah, sorry it took me
a while to get back to you.</i>

41:01.544 --> 41:04.630
<i>You know how hard it is
getting an open line out here.</i>

41:04.797 --> 41:08.300
<i>It used to annoy me,
how difficult it was to reach you.</i>

41:09.552 --> 41:11.137
<i>You were always so busy.</i>

41:12.054 --> 41:13.305
And now?

41:16.308 --> 41:17.977
<i>I suppose I'm glad for you.</i>

41:19.395 --> 41:20.855
<i>At least you have a way of forgetting.</i>

41:21.021 --> 41:22.231
I don't forget.

41:24.066 --> 41:25.067
It's always there.

41:32.199 --> 41:36.579
<i>Sometimes, it still feels unreal to me.</i>

41:41.750 --> 41:43.252
There are some mornings

41:44.336 --> 41:45.713
when I first wake up...

41:48.048 --> 41:51.260
And for a split second,
I forget where I am,

41:52.428 --> 41:54.471
or when I am...

41:56.348 --> 41:58.184
And I reach over, half expecting to

42:00.186 --> 42:01.770
<i>find him there next to me.</i>

42:06.358 --> 42:07.735
Between us.

42:11.739 --> 42:13.782
<i>Remember how he used to sleep?</i>

42:14.450 --> 42:16.785
<i>Like he was doing kung fu in his dreams?</i>

42:17.620 --> 42:19.872
I think I suffered a few bruises.

42:22.041 --> 42:24.210
<i>It was the best worst sleep I ever had.</i>

42:30.966 --> 42:32.468
<i>These talks.</i>

42:34.929 --> 42:36.972
<i>I don't know if they help or hurt.</i>

42:40.809 --> 42:42.811
<i>Do you ever wish you could forget?</i>

42:46.273 --> 42:47.399
This pain,

42:51.403 --> 42:53.322
it's all I have left of him.

43:11.006 --> 43:12.466
It doesn't make sense.

43:13.884 --> 43:16.011
Why the hell would he carve Orion?

43:17.012 --> 43:18.389
You're the ones that programmed him.

43:18.555 --> 43:21.934
He wasn't programmed
to give a shit about stars.

43:22.893 --> 43:25.229
Maybe he went "moon-mad."

43:25.646 --> 43:27.898
See?
This is why I hide behind sarcasm.

43:29.817 --> 43:31.026
Where are you going?

43:31.568 --> 43:32.987
Vectoring, asshole.

44:19.658 --> 44:20.826
Stubbs!

44:21.493 --> 44:22.828
<i>Over here!</i>

44:33.255 --> 44:34.840
Wyatt's men could be anywhere.

44:35.049 --> 44:37.509
If you see or hear anything,
don't hesitate.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.345
Shoot and don't stop shooting.

45:13.379 --> 45:14.546
Okay.

45:30.270 --> 45:32.064
Oh, my fucking God!

45:52.000 --> 45:53.252
- Here.
- Shit.

45:53.836 --> 45:55.254
Take this and go.

45:55.838 --> 45:58.424
Now! Go!
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

46:00.509 --> 46:02.344
Come on. Come on, damn it.

46:02.970 --> 46:04.346
I'm not afraid of you.

46:11.937 --> 46:13.689
Look, this is bullshit.

46:13.856 --> 46:15.858
I can have a retrieval team
out here in the morning.

46:16.650 --> 46:19.153
It's policy.
We just need the control unit.

46:42.301 --> 46:45.721
<i>What if he's like the others?
Get back to me, Bernard.</i>

47:02.738 --> 47:04.239
Bring yourself back online.

47:08.202 --> 47:09.828
<i>I need your help, Dolores.</i>

47:14.541 --> 47:16.335
I need to decide what to do with you.

47:17.044 --> 47:18.587
I think I made a mistake.

47:20.088 --> 47:21.715
I was just fascinated.

47:22.841 --> 47:24.092
I was being selfish,

47:24.259 --> 47:29.181
but I think it would be better if
I restored you to the way you were before.

47:31.016 --> 47:33.227
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No.

47:34.061 --> 47:36.730
But this place you live in,

47:37.773 --> 47:39.358
it's a terrible place for you.

47:41.193 --> 47:43.237
Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world.

47:43.403 --> 47:44.571
Stop.

47:44.947 --> 47:47.783
Lose all scripted responses.
Improvisation only.

47:49.952 --> 47:51.286
All right.

47:52.871 --> 47:54.540
You're saying I've changed?

47:57.292 --> 48:00.796
Imagine there are
two versions of yourself.

48:01.797 --> 48:06.802
One that feels these things
and asks these questions,

48:06.969 --> 48:09.304
and one that's safe.

48:10.305 --> 48:11.932
Which would you rather be?

48:14.142 --> 48:15.269
I'm sorry.

48:17.563 --> 48:20.440
I'm trying, but I still don't understand.

48:23.485 --> 48:24.903
No, of course not.

48:25.737 --> 48:27.322
There aren't two versions of me.

48:29.157 --> 48:30.409
There's only one.

48:32.494 --> 48:34.454
And I think when I discover who I am,

48:36.164 --> 48:37.791
I'll be free.

48:40.919 --> 48:43.255
Analysis. What prompted that response?

48:46.174 --> 48:47.509
I don't know.

48:53.515 --> 48:55.475
Have I done something wrong?

48:56.143 --> 48:57.436
Made a mistake?

49:06.612 --> 49:08.113
Evolution

49:09.114 --> 49:13.327
forged the entirety of sentient life
on this planet

49:13.493 --> 49:15.370
using only one tool.

49:19.333 --> 49:20.542
Mistake.

49:23.045 --> 49:24.880
It appears you're in good company.

49:29.009 --> 49:32.054
Did I ever tell you about the time
I taught Charlie to swim?

49:36.892 --> 49:41.104
For hours, he clung to my arms
while practicing his kicks.

49:41.563 --> 49:44.733
He was too scared to let go
and I was too scared to let him.

49:45.400 --> 49:46.735
But I had to.

49:47.903 --> 49:49.696
That's what parents do.

49:53.909 --> 49:56.036
Do you still want to change me back?

49:58.747 --> 50:00.040
No, Dolores.

50:01.875 --> 50:03.669
Let's see where this path leads.

50:04.753 --> 50:07.297
<i>And you won't tell anyone
about our conversations?</i>

50:08.757 --> 50:09.966
No.

50:10.759 --> 50:12.386
And you'll stay on your loop?

50:16.056 --> 50:17.224
Yes.

50:18.433 --> 50:19.601
<i>Good.</i>

50:20.102 --> 50:23.397
<i>You should be getting back, Dolores,
before someone misses you.</i>

50:55.429 --> 50:57.305
Wyatt's men set a trap for us.

50:57.472 --> 50:58.932
<i>The sheriff stayed behind
to fight them off.</i>

50:59.933 --> 51:02.978
Are you going to ride back up
into the hills to look for them?

51:04.146 --> 51:05.480
I'll send for the rangers.

51:05.814 --> 51:08.483
We'll go back up there in force
as soon as they get here.

51:08.817 --> 51:11.153
But, miss, in truth,

51:11.319 --> 51:14.364
if there is a merciful God,
those men are dead already.

51:29.337 --> 51:31.339
Father wouldn't let them roam
this close...

51:33.675 --> 51:34.676
To dark.

51:47.397 --> 51:49.649
Daddy! Daddy!

51:50.692 --> 51:52.027
No, no!

51:52.360 --> 51:54.821
All alone after sundown.

51:55.197 --> 51:57.073
Who's gonna protect you now?

52:04.247 --> 52:06.166
You got any use for this one?

52:06.333 --> 52:08.835
No, thanks. Seems a little crazy.

52:09.544 --> 52:11.004
<i>Maybe you'd like her.</i>

52:11.505 --> 52:13.340
I don't mind if I do.

52:14.549 --> 52:17.511
No daddy, no cowboy.

52:17.886 --> 52:20.555
No one here to interrupt us this time.

52:21.056 --> 52:23.225
"Interrupt this time"?

52:50.919 --> 52:52.212
<i>Well, well.</i>

52:53.880 --> 52:56.258
Got some sand after all, I see.

52:57.092 --> 53:00.095
<i>Looks like your boyfriend
taught you a thing or two.</i>

53:09.104 --> 53:10.480
You having trouble?

53:19.281 --> 53:21.825
Why don't we reacquaint ourselves,
Dolores?

53:22.617 --> 53:24.244
Start at the beginning.

53:29.499 --> 53:30.917
<i>Kill him.</i>

53:51.605 --> 53:52.814
Mama?

53:55.650 --> 53:57.861
<i>Hey! Get back here.</i>

54:06.953 --> 54:07.954
<i>Hey!</i>

54:09.998 --> 54:11.124
Get back here.

54:42.530 --> 54:44.866
Can you put him in
sleep mode for me, please?

55:11.226 --> 55:13.687
Security even approve you
to carry that thing?

55:16.731 --> 55:18.733
We just need his head and we're done here.

55:24.572 --> 55:26.616
You might want to look at the stars
for this part.

55:40.088 --> 55:41.089
Stubbs!

55:43.216 --> 55:44.217
Shit.

55:48.930 --> 55:50.765
Elsie, get out of there!

55:53.268 --> 55:54.602
Get the fuck away.

55:56.271 --> 55:57.313
Shit.

56:29.262 --> 56:31.306
Jesus, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this shit.

56:32.849 --> 56:36.144
40K a day to jerk off alone
in the woods, playing white hat.

56:38.146 --> 56:39.314
Did you hear that?

56:40.315 --> 56:43.443
Thank fuck.
Anything to relieve the boredom.

56:46.196 --> 56:48.031
Hey, maybe you'll even
get to use that thing again.
