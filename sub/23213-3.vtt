they saw Frank

wading into the water
on their way out around 5:00.

hour for a swim.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.440

be getting light.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.440
Mmm. Did they see
anyone go in after him?

06:31.520 --> 06:34.560
-Not that they mentioned.
-Frank left his towel
and his shoes

06:34.640 --> 06:36.120
over there, on the rocks.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.960
And sometime during
the next two hours...

in the heart, out at sea.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.960
Was that out of character?

07:11.040 --> 07:14.840
No, not the swimming.
But, the timing was, erm...

07:14.920 --> 07:17.040
I was usually awake
before he was.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.800
And this swim was unplanned?

07:18.880 --> 07:22.440
-Nobody knew he was going?
-No, we were all asleep.

switched on the

go to bed last night?

07:40.520 --> 07:44.280
Well, I went first,
at about 11:45.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.360
And then I was asleep
when he came to bed.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.320
And I wasn't far behind you.
Ten minutes or so.

07:52.760 --> 07:57.080
Frank and I stayed up,
hitting the cognac for a while

07:57.160 --> 08:00.080
no idea when we called
it a night. Late.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.800
So you were the last person
to see Frank alive?

08:02.880 --> 08:05.520
I suppose I must
have been. Yeah.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.680
Apart from the killer.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.040
FLORENCE: And how was Frank
the day before he died?

08:14.160 --> 08:18.360
-Any unusual behaviour?
-No.

08:18.440 --> 08:22.280
He finished work about midday
when Larry turned up and then...

08:22.360 --> 08:27.240
Champagne stocks look
perilously low. I think I'll
nip in to town and, er,

08:27.320 --> 08:29.640
-replenish.
-I'll come with you.

08:29.720 --> 08:33.600
No, no, you're our guest, Larry.
You make yourself at home.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
May I?

08:44.400 --> 08:47.840
-Whose work is this?
-It's mine. Why?

08:47.920 --> 08:50.080
-It's absolutely top-notch.
-Oh!

08:50.160 --> 08:52.760
Do I detect a, er,
hint of coconut in that icing?

08:52.840 --> 08:54.440
A little bit.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.720
-Ooh.
-Forgive me, but we have to ask.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.720
Can anyone think of a reason
someone might want Frank dead?

09:00.800 --> 09:03.080
No! Dear God, no.

09:07.400 --> 09:12.040
He could be a belligerent
old bugger, but no one
had any reason

09:12.120 --> 09:14.800
to bump him off.

09:14.880 --> 09:19.000
Oh, would you look at that?
You would never go thirsty
around here, would you?

09:19.080 --> 09:22.440
There's a good case
and a half of champagne
and the dust tells me,

09:22.520 --> 09:24.520
it's been there for a while.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.960
But Frank didn't think it'd be
enough for the four of you?

09:28.400 --> 09:31.720
Well, he must have forgotten
that they were there.

09:34.560 --> 09:39.200
So, besides belligerent,
how would any of you
describe Frank?

09:39.280 --> 09:42.880
Well, if you want to know
who my husband was

09:44.240 --> 09:46.000
you should start
by reading him.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.080
Wouldn't you know it,
they've misspelled my name.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.080
-Thank you.
-It should say "Mooney."

10:25.600 --> 10:27.920
Ah.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
Still, close enough, eh?
No point wasting another tree.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.920
You know what's niggling me?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.920
How on Earth did the killer
know that Frank would be
going for a swim?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.080
Maybe, they'd been
keeping watch.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.280
Yeah, but, why would they be
watching the house at 5:00 in
the morning on the off-chance?

10:49.360 --> 10:52.560
Which makes me think it's
more likely to be someone
inside the house.

10:52.640 --> 10:56.360
Someone who just happened
to hear or see Frank leave
and seize their moment.

10:56.440 --> 11:00.360
We know his wife was
sleeping beside him. If anyone
was going to notice him

11:00.440 --> 11:02.400
-go for a swim...
-True, but, all the bedrooms

11:02.480 --> 11:03.920
face that way.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.680
So the killer could have been
any one of those three people?

11:06.760 --> 11:09.240
You would think? Mmm.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.680

out who this man was?

to turn the place inside out.

-Here! Let me.
-No, it's... It's no need.

isn't it? You're

11:28.440 --> 11:29.880
No, I'm, er...

11:29.960 --> 11:33.240
Well, I was Frank's
research assistant,

11:33.320 --> 11:35.240

Not published anything, yet.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.120

you out to the island?

11:47.200 --> 11:51.960
Frank. He invited me out.
I've always been a fan.

-Yeah.

asked if anyone could think
of a reason why

12:12.640 --> 12:16.400
someone might want Frank dead,
you didn't say anything.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.120
But I couldn't help noticing,
you looked at Larry.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.920
I didn't. I mean, I wouldn't
read anything into that.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.480
Well, I'm afraid that's
what I do, read things
into things.

12:29.560 --> 12:34.240
Sort of goes along with being
a detective. (SIGHS)

12:34.320 --> 12:37.120
I mean, I'm sure it's
probably nothing, but,

12:37.200 --> 12:40.320
I sat in the garden
after dinner last night,
I was trying to sober up.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.920
(FRANK AND LARRY ARGUING)

12:42.000 --> 12:43.640
GILLIAN: Frank and Larry
had gone inside
to drink Cognac.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.640
But, after about 20 minutes,
they started arguing.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.240
Like I said,
it's probably nothing.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.160
I wasn't really operating
at full capacity.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.760
No.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.640
Well, thanks all the same.
It all helps to paint
the picture.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.680
Lovely cake.

13:08.240 --> 13:13.120
Just as I suspected.
Nobody forgets they've got
18 bottles of champagne.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.800
It's the exact same stuff
that was in the house.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.360
Even, got the same dust on it.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.520
So Frank didn't go in to town
to buy champagne.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.800
He may have gone in to town,

13:19.880 --> 13:21.280
but it wasn't to buy champagne,
that's for sure.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.000
Trouble is, he went alone.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.640
So your guess is as good
as mine as to where he went.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.920
(BOTTLES CLINK)

13:27.000 --> 13:31.040
Sir, see here, tyre tracks.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.120
JACK: Yeah, and they're fresh.
Let's get Dwayne and JP onto it.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.680
See if anyone in the house
owns a motor bike

13:36.760 --> 13:38.280
or had any deliveries
this morning.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.200
Mmm.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.600
This Frank O'Toole was
a pretty big deal.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.760
Eleven awards.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.240
DWAYNE: But, check the dates,
nothing since 1989.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.600
And take a look around.

13:55.680 --> 13:59.920
Manual typewriter,
fax machine. The man was
stuck in a time warp.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.120
(DWAYNE SIGHS)

14:05.440 --> 14:08.800
Of course, this would be
a lot quicker if I had
a bit more help, Dwayne.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.280
Huh?

14:10.360 --> 14:12.720
Listen, it's all right for you,
you know.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.080
You've already got
a beautiful wife.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.880
I've got less than a day
to find someone.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.920
And you know what they say,
alone for the Erzulie,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.400
alone all year long.
And I don't like being
on my own.

-Last message received.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.080
WOMAN: (ON RADIO)
My castaway this week
is a prolific author,

14:38.160 --> 14:42.320
writer of the best-selling
Jim Harvey spy thrillers,
Frank O'Toole.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.520
Welcome, Frank.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.360
FRANK: Pleasure to
be here, Sue.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.680
I love this show.
It's a real institution
back home.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.920
He has to choose eight records
to take to a desert island.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.040
They leave him
on an island, alone?

14:54.120 --> 14:59.000
Er, no, no, no,
it's not a real island.
It's hypothetical.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.120
WOMAN: (ON RADIO) So tell me
about your first record?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.200
FRANK: I've chosen
The British Grenadiers,

15:03.280 --> 15:05.560
they're the marching band
of the Blues and Royals.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.720
-A marching band, really?
-(MARCHING BAND MUSIC PLAYING)

15:08.800 --> 15:11.760
What's wrong with you?
You could have had Dylan
or The Beatles

15:11.840 --> 15:13.720
and you chose this.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.600
But, if you're stranded
on an island, why do you
care about music?

15:17.680 --> 15:19.160
You just wanna stay alive, no?

15:19.240 --> 15:22.080
No, Florence, er,
you're still not getting it.

15:22.160 --> 15:26.200
It... It's not a real island.
It's just a way to get
the person to reveal

15:26.280 --> 15:28.680
something of themselves. I was
hoping it might give me some

15:28.760 --> 15:30.600
insight into Frank.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.520
But all it's told me so far is
he had woeful taste in music.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.480
And what about his book?
What does that tell you?

15:37.560 --> 15:40.480
Yeah, well, this Jim Harvey
is a bit of an idiot,
to be honest with you.

15:40.560 --> 15:42.440
Thirteen pages in,
he's already slept with a woman

15:42.520 --> 15:45.040
he's supposed to be spying on,
while drunk.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.880
-I assume Frank's ex-military.
-How did you...

15:47.960 --> 15:52.000
(CHUCKLES) Only an
old soldier goes misty-eyed
for a marching band.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.760
Was Frank O'Toole
his real name or
a nom de what's it?

15:54.840 --> 15:58.880
Plume. Oh, no,
he was born Francis Toole.
He just added the O.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.320
Wanted to sound like
a real Irishman.
And who can blame him?

16:02.400 --> 16:06.600
He wrote 40 novels,
one a year. Last night,
they celebrated 40 years

16:06.680 --> 16:12.240
since his first publication.
Frank had two failed marriages
until he met...

16:12.320 --> 16:16.640
Valerie O'Toole, 54. She was
an actress but,
she gave it all up

16:16.720 --> 16:20.000
when she married Frank 23 years
ago. Then, there's...

16:20.080 --> 16:22.120
JACK: The ten percenter.
FLORENCE: Larry South.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.720
Late 60s.
He discovered Frank when he
was just a local reporter.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.080
Right. But we know from Gilly
there was tension.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.560
They were arguing just
last night.
And there she is,

16:31.640 --> 16:35.640
the research assistant
slash protege
slash cake baker.

16:35.720 --> 16:40.200
Gilly White, late 30s,
worked in a book shop
until three months ago,

16:40.280 --> 16:44.240
-somewhere called Stoke.
-Ah, yeah, Stoke. A lovely spot.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.880
So how did she get from
there to here?

16:45.960 --> 16:49.400
I'm working on it.
All we know so far
is Frank invited her.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.640
We don't yet know
how they met.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.440
WOMAN: (ON RADIO) And now,
we come to your luxury.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.320
What have you chosen
to take with you?

16:56.400 --> 16:59.000
FRANK: Well, one item
I really couldn't

16:59.080 --> 17:02.200
live without is a decent cup of
English breakfast tea.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.280
(SIGHS) A cup of tea?

17:04.360 --> 17:06.320
Er, that's the
one thing you take?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.560
You're stuck in an island
for flip's sake.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.480
One word for you,
sir, sausages.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.240
(CHUCKLES) No, that's not
the same thing at all,
Florence.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.320
They were
exceptional sausages.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.400
Here we go, Chief.
Every single thing
from Frank's house

17:20.480 --> 17:22.400
that might conceivably
be of interest.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.800
But, you might want to
look at this first, sir.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.640
Frank was sent this
fax late last night.

17:27.720 --> 17:31.600
He was about to sign
with a new agent?

17:31.680 --> 17:35.360
So Larry not only faced
the threat of being discarded
by an old friend

17:35.440 --> 17:37.360
after, what, 40 years?

17:37.440 --> 17:39.960
But also losing what
must have been a fairly
hefty income.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.880
No wonder they were arguing.

17:42.960 --> 17:47.240
LARRY: Just so you know,
I don't normally hit
the sauce this early.

17:47.320 --> 17:51.240
My nerves are a
tad jangly just now.

17:51.320 --> 17:56.080
It pains me to tell you this,
but Frank's best days
were behind him.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.640
No one would publish his last
two novels, he blamed me.

17:59.720 --> 18:03.240
That's what you were arguing
about last night, after dinner?

18:03.320 --> 18:06.160
Oh, that was just
a bit of nonsense, really.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.800
We were both three sheets
to the wind.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.520
Frank was telling me that he was
going to sign with a new agent.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.280
But no, I need someone
young and dynamic.

18:14.360 --> 18:18.400
And you think that'd make the
blindest bit of difference,
do you? It won't!

18:18.480 --> 18:21.040
He just did that to get
a rise out of me.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.840
I am sorry to be
the one to tell you.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.320
LARRY: Ah.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.960
-Well, there you go.
-JACK: Frank's switching agents.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.440
I assume there'd be financial
implications for you?

18:39.520 --> 18:43.840
As I told you, the golden
goose had stopped laying
eggs sometime ago.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.640
Thank you for
your time, Mr South.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.600
They're saying Frank's murder
won't do his book sales
any harm.

18:53.680 --> 18:57.240
I suppose you're right,
I just haven't thought
of it in those terms.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.040
No? Well, it seems to me

18:59.120 --> 19:02.200
that a thriller writer dying
in mysterious circumstances,

19:02.280 --> 19:05.240
well, you can't buy that
sort of publicity, can you?

19:05.320 --> 19:06.320
What's your point?

19:08.040 --> 19:09.960
It just strikes me
that poor Frank

19:10.040 --> 19:13.480
is not really in a position
to enjoy his renaissance.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.920
But you'll still get your,
what is it, 10%

19:16.000 --> 19:17.720
of every penny he makes.

19:17.800 --> 19:21.720
Chief, I may be an agent,
but I'm not that ruthless.

19:24.760 --> 19:29.240
So, JP, what's the story with
those financial cheques?

19:29.320 --> 19:33.560
I went back over
the last five years, sir,
and it seems the O'Tooles

19:33.640 --> 19:36.760
didn't have a lot of money.
Not as much as we think, anyway.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.000
So Larry was right.
Book sales aren't
what they were.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.560
I get from his wife's
perspective, he's worth
a lot more dead than alive.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.040
Chief, I checked out those
tyre tracks like you asked.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.920
They belong to a small
scooter, but no-one in the
house owns one,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.520
and they've had no deliveries
in the last week.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.160
Well, someone was
outside that house
on a scooter and recently.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.520
I've managed to pull up
some more information
about Gilly White.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.280
Here's the homepage of her
social media profile.
Take a look.

20:06.360 --> 20:10.920
Ah, the social media page,
God's gift to detectives.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.600
A year ago she got engaged to
the manager of
the book shop in Stoke,

20:14.680 --> 20:19.280
Dean Shanks, and if the
comments from their friends
are anything to go by...

20:19.360 --> 20:21.280
"Where are you, Gilly?"

20:21.360 --> 20:22.680
"How could you do
this to Dean?"

20:22.760 --> 20:25.040
And here's one
from Dean, himself,

20:25.120 --> 20:26.800
"Call me please,
I need answers."

20:28.480 --> 20:31.360
She recently cut
off all contact.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.480
Right. Let's see if we
can't set up a video chat
with this Dean fella.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.040
Hear what he has to
say for himself.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.720
Frank O'Toole decides
on the spur of the moment

20:39.800 --> 20:42.000
to go for an early morning dip.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.720
He tells no one he's going,

20:43.800 --> 20:45.440
just leaves a note
on his pillow.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.920
Yet one of these three,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.360
the wife, the agent,
the protege, gets wind
of the fact,

20:49.440 --> 20:52.120
rouses themselves from their
heavy post-champagne slumber

20:52.200 --> 20:55.120
and follows him down
to the beach.
No sign of a boat.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.560
So we assume they swim
out after him and then...

20:58.640 --> 21:00.920
But why not stab him
on the beach or in the house?

21:01.840 --> 21:03.160
Why wait till he's out to sea?

21:07.200 --> 21:08.680
No witnesses, I suppose.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.880
Yeah, not much chance
of recovering DNA.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.960
Not from a million square
miles of open water.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.600
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

21:19.560 --> 21:22.440
She's been following
me around the island.
I thought I'd seen just

21:22.520 --> 21:25.320
about every saint going.
She's something else.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.880
(CHUCKLES)

21:26.960 --> 21:29.880
They say if you make
her an offering,
she'll bring you love.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.680
-What sort of offering?
-She loves knives, rum

21:33.760 --> 21:36.480
-and unfiltered cigarettes.
-Oh, I knew a girl
like that once

21:36.560 --> 21:39.520
back in County Cork.
Butcher's daughter, Emer.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.480
Biggest hands I've ever
seen on a woman.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.360
(ALL LAUGHING)

21:43.440 --> 21:45.920
Look, I know we didn't
really talk a lot at school,
Darlene,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.120
-but I always...
-Did we ever speak?

21:48.200 --> 21:52.040
Well, not really,
you know, actual words.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.160
But you were a bit
younger than me.

21:54.240 --> 21:58.240
-Only a bit?
-All right, a lot.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.280
But, if I'd known you was
going to grow up to look
like this, oh, well...

22:01.360 --> 22:04.560
So, now, years later,
the day before Erzulie,

22:04.640 --> 22:06.320
you find yourself
without a date.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.760
So you run around
the bar in a panic
to see the only woman

22:09.840 --> 22:11.760
-standing on her own...
-No!

22:11.840 --> 22:13.720
It's not because you're
on your own, Darlene.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.640
And it's not because
I'm panicking.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.000
It's because you're the most
beautiful woman on the island.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.160
(LAUGHS)

22:23.000 --> 22:29.360
You know what, every year
at Erzulie, I get taken to
the same restaurant

22:29.440 --> 22:31.280
and I eat the same meal.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.240
-Hmm.
-Just once

22:34.320 --> 22:37.120
I wish someone would
make a real effort.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.120
I like a man who can cook.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.440
Can you cook, Dwayne?

22:44.520 --> 22:45.960
(CHUCKLES)

22:48.520 --> 22:49.880
Excuse me a minute.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.720
(LAUGHING)

22:53.800 --> 22:57.160
Don't look now, but
the most beautiful woman
on the island just agreed

22:57.240 --> 22:58.880
to let me cook her
an Erzulie meal.

23:01.520 --> 23:05.360
So I decided I was going
to cook her some of my
sure-thing chicken.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.480
But then I remembered
I don't live on my own.

23:09.560 --> 23:13.640
Oh, right. No, don't you
worry, Dwayne. Understood.
I'll make myself scarce.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.720
(CHUCKLES)

23:14.800 --> 23:16.240
You won't even know I'm there.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.400
(DWAYNE HUMMING IN THE SHOWER)

23:27.720 --> 23:31.240
Hey, Dwayne,
you must be clean by now.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.720
Hold on there, Chief.
You can't rush the regime.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.320
It takes a lot of time
and effort to look this good.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.280
I swear, you take longer
in the bathroom
than anyone I've ever met

23:40.360 --> 23:42.960
and I've got four sisters
and they're big girls.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.600
It's like he's never heard
of personal space.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.000
I guess it's a while since
he lived with anyone
that wasn't family.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.080
But I'm not family.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.200
He's meant to be my boss.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.480
Pathology reports
have come through.

23:58.560 --> 24:01.480
Cause of death,
definitely the stab wound.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.960
And they found some tiny fibres
under Frank's fingernails.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.760
Iron oxide and polyurethane.

24:07.840 --> 24:11.160
Iron oxide is used for
making paint and polyurethane
is type of varnish,

24:11.240 --> 24:13.720
you might use it to make
something water resistant.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.000
That's it, of course,

24:16.080 --> 24:17.480
there must have been a boat.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.640
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Frank wasn't stabbed
in the water,

24:19.720 --> 24:23.160
the killer had a boat
and the paint and varnish
were under Frank's nails

24:23.240 --> 24:25.200
so he must have...
What was he doing?

24:25.280 --> 24:28.040
Why was he clambering
onto a boat in the middle
of a sea?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.880
And where did
this boat come from?

24:29.960 --> 24:31.640
Is it possible that
the killer had it

24:31.720 --> 24:33.360
stashed around the bay?

24:33.440 --> 24:36.280
But even if they did
that doesn't really explain

24:36.360 --> 24:39.080
how he got from the house
to the boat in time to
meet Frank out there.

24:40.320 --> 24:41.640
-Unless...
-Unless?

24:41.720 --> 24:43.720
They had a scooter.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.320
Ooh, that's very good, Florence.
Stick a pin in that thought.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.800
First things first, Dwayne, JP,
ring around the marinas,

24:49.880 --> 24:53.240
speak to the harbour masters.
See if anyone saw
(STAMMERING) a grey boat,

24:53.320 --> 24:55.520
coming or going, between 5:00
and 7:00 yesterday morning.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.480
-Aye aye, Captain.
-Any luck with Gilly's fiance?

24:58.560 --> 25:00.480
He's expecting our video
call any time.

25:03.040 --> 25:06.240
JP: So this was found
floating out to sea
and the harbour master said,

25:06.320 --> 25:10.480
as far as he can tell,
it's unregistered and as you
know, all boats on the island

25:10.560 --> 25:11.760
have to be registered.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.080
Hang on a minute.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.280
Heh, got you.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.840
Er, Dwayne?

25:27.840 --> 25:28.840
Huh?

25:29.640 --> 25:30.840
Looks like blood.

25:33.640 --> 25:36.120
Frank came to
do a signing about a year ago.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.880
(SIGHS)

25:37.960 --> 25:41.000
Don't get it myself,
always seemed like
a budget le Carre to me.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.800
But Gilly did this
online thriller-writing course

25:43.880 --> 25:46.600
and he was like
a rock star to her.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.080
Now, they met at the book shop
where you were both working?

25:49.160 --> 25:52.080
She asked him to sign a book,
told him she was a writer.

25:52.160 --> 25:55.200
Next thing I know,
he's only invited her to
stay with him and his wife

25:55.280 --> 25:57.160
on some tropical island.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.480
First, she was a bit home sick.
She used to

25:59.560 --> 26:03.560
call me every day,
but then, she changed.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.280
She became obsessed
with her novel. Her last book
got rejected by

26:06.360 --> 26:10.160
fifteen publishers and
she was terrified of it
happening again.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.320
That's all she could
talk about. And then,
two months ago

26:13.400 --> 26:18.560
she just stopped answering
her phone, emails, texts,
ignored them all.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.720
All right, Dean.
Well, thanks for your time.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.160
If she wanted to end it,

26:25.240 --> 26:26.920
why didn't she just say so?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.280
Why did she just ghost him?

26:29.360 --> 26:31.400
Mmm. Why don't we ask her?

26:31.480 --> 26:34.120
JACK: Paradise Mislaid.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.840
This is the novel you've been
working on?

26:35.920 --> 26:39.320
Well, it... It's very much
a work in progress.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.480
Sadly, Frank never got to
read my latest draft.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.280
I've been working on it,
day and night,
these past two weeks.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.400
These are his notes?

26:48.040 --> 26:51.440
-Not one to mince
his words, was he?
-I came out here to learn.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.880
It was always constructive.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.160
And this is what he signed at
your book shop, the day you met?

27:00.240 --> 27:02.400
-How did you know?
-We just spoke to Dean Shanks.

27:02.480 --> 27:06.480
Why? Dean's not a
part of my life any more.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.640
So the engagement's off.
Your decision?

27:09.720 --> 27:12.960
GILLY: Yeah, it was.
We wanted different things.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.200
I had to focus on me writing.

27:15.280 --> 27:18.920
Sometimes you've got to be
a bit hard-nosed, don't you?

27:19.000 --> 27:23.200
I know that seems selfish,
but I'm not gonna have
this chance again.

27:23.280 --> 27:27.360
So, tell me, how long ago did
Frank end your affair?

27:27.440 --> 27:30.720
-What?
-Well, Frank's criticism
isn't cruel,

27:30.800 --> 27:34.880
but it is intimate.
"Clumsy, darling, I know
you're better than this."

27:34.960 --> 27:37.320
And there's a lingering scent
of after shave in your towel

27:37.400 --> 27:39.320
and the shower's set
to a man's height.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.960
Also, this should be a prized
memento of that first meeting.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.200
You wouldn't tear it
up unless you were in
a blind, passionate rage.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.920
I didn't tear it up, Dean did.

27:53.440 --> 27:56.160
He couldn't understand
why I'd wanna come out here.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.200
He's never been further
than Spain.
(LAUGHS)

27:59.200 --> 28:01.440
And I wouldn't
call it an affair.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.360
It was just a silly fling.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.880
But... But for
what it's worth,
Frank didn't end it.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.520
In fact, he'd just
booked these.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.840
JACK: A trip to Prague?

28:15.920 --> 28:17.920
He wanted to show
me his favourite city.

28:19.360 --> 28:23.120
It was a research trip
in theory.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.040
Only, please
don't tell Valerie.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.520
She's been through enough.

28:28.840 --> 28:32.080
Wife and mistress
under the same roof.
And he wasn't even French.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.640
(CHUCKLES)
So, Valerie had a motive,
assuming that she knew.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.000
Sorry to disturb you,
Mrs O'Toole. May I?

28:45.360 --> 28:46.360
Come in.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.480
Frank would never let anyone
sit in his chair.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.640
Or, God forbid,
touch his beloved Irene.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.360
(VALERIE CHUCKLES)

28:56.440 --> 28:58.520
He was superstitious
like that.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.040
And he was working
on something new.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.560
Mmm.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.800
Novel 41. The Moscow Mule.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.240
JACK: Mmm.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.400
Did he always plan
it all out like this?

29:10.480 --> 29:12.600
He never just made it up
as he went along, no?

29:12.680 --> 29:14.640
Frank would never start
until he knew the ending.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.520
It was one of the few rules
that he never broke.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.720
He always says,

29:21.800 --> 29:24.320
"A good writer plots backwards."

29:26.840 --> 29:28.280
(STAMMERS) Said...

29:30.240 --> 29:33.000
(SOBS) Sorry... I can't.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.720
I'm sorry.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.520
We can go somewhere
more comfortable,
if you'd prefer.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.560
FLORENCE: You and Frank
had been together 23 years?

29:42.640 --> 29:44.840
I was in the TV version
of one of his books.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.960
He was married to someone else
at the time. The...

29:49.960 --> 29:51.360
The papers were scandalised.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.160
But he was a good husband?

29:55.200 --> 29:57.480
He loved me, I loved him.

29:57.560 --> 30:00.960
Must be strange, though,
being married to
a well-known writer.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.880
All those readers who feel
they know him intimately.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.520
Did it never feel like you
were sharing him?

30:06.600 --> 30:12.000
I suppose, occasionally,
it bothered me that he was
so receptive to his

30:13.120 --> 30:14.400
prettier, younger fans.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.400
But you were happy enough
to welcome one into your home?

30:18.480 --> 30:22.240
I wouldn't say happy.
It was pragmatism on my part.

30:22.320 --> 30:26.960
Frank needed the validation of
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
adoring younger women.

30:27.040 --> 30:30.040
Better it happen under
my roof where I could
keep an eye on him.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.760
-So you turned a blind eye?
-No, my eyes were wide open.

30:32.840 --> 30:36.680
She's the one with blinkers on.
Poor, naive little girl.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.720
I knew he'd tire
of her soon enough.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.040
Well, did you know he'd booked
a trip to Prague for
the two of them?

30:44.120 --> 30:45.080
A research trip.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.600
It was my idea.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.560
Your idea?

30:48.640 --> 30:51.520
I knew a week alone with her
would put him off for good.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.480
Well...

30:53.560 --> 30:55.680
-How could you be so sure?
-Because she was clingy

30:55.760 --> 30:59.240
and Frank couldn't
bare clingy. We had to send
her off to Montserrat

30:59.320 --> 31:01.240
last weekend,
just so that we could breathe.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.680
Forgive me, Mrs O'Toole.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.800
I know you and Frank
had been struggling
financially.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.160
But the terrible irony is
that with Frank's death...

31:08.240 --> 31:11.600
You think I give a damn about
book sales or money?
My husband

31:11.680 --> 31:15.640
was murdered yesterday
and I would give everything
I have, everything

31:15.720 --> 31:17.480
to bring him back again.

31:18.840 --> 31:22.000
You have no idea what we had.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.400
Well, if it isn't
inspector Jack Money?

31:25.480 --> 31:27.240
Is this how you
conduct your investigations,

31:27.320 --> 31:30.040
sitting around sipping tea?
There's a killer
out there, man!

31:30.120 --> 31:32.680
-Sir.
-Who knows?

31:32.760 --> 31:36.400
-Deciding which of us
to bump off next.
-Stop it, Larry.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.560
You're not helping.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.040
(SCOFFS)

31:45.920 --> 31:49.000
Yes, so once we had
the number. It didn't take
us long to find

31:49.080 --> 31:51.480
the boat's last registered
owner, Zeke the Crabman.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.800
-Zeke the Crabman?
-Zeke the Crabman.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.760
Took a while for Zeke
to sober up enough to speak,
but when he did,

31:56.840 --> 31:58.560
he told us he sold the boat
two weeks ago.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.560
-Did he say to whom?
-Mr Otis Falconer.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.880
Otis Falconer, well there's
a name to conjure with.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.600
Any description of the man?

32:05.680 --> 32:08.640
No, Zeke said it was
all done by email and
the cash posted to him.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.200
-They never met.
-Right, well,
I think we can safely

32:11.280 --> 32:13.640
file that under
suspicious behaviour.

32:13.720 --> 32:16.760
Oh, I was so certain it
had to be one of these three.

32:16.840 --> 32:19.400
We've got motives.
We've got proximity,

32:19.480 --> 32:24.080
and then, suddenly
enter stage left,
Mr Otis Falconer.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.440
A mysterious man with a boat.

32:27.520 --> 32:30.080
And all the cards are
thrown up in the air.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.720
(CLICKS TONGUE) Right.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.080
Let's find this Otis
and bring him in
for questioning.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.800
DWAYNE: Er, about that,
Chief,

32:35.880 --> 32:38.160
we checked with
the land registry
and Immigration

32:38.240 --> 32:42.560
and there's absolutely
no record of an
Otis Falconer on Saint Marie.

32:42.640 --> 32:46.600
I also called the O'Toole
household, they had never
even heard of the name.

32:46.680 --> 32:51.080
So we don't know what Otis
looks like or where Otis lives.

32:51.160 --> 32:55.640
Or what Otis's connection
to Frank is. All we have
is a name and a boat.

32:55.720 --> 33:00.640
-And possibly a scooter.
-Ah, yes. The scooter. Right.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.600
What if it was Otis who
was sitting outside the house,
watching and waiting

33:04.680 --> 33:07.840
for the moment Frank emerged,
so as he could zip
around to his boat.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.680
Dwayne, JP, I need you
to visit every scooter
shop in the island.

33:10.760 --> 33:14.800
Find out if anyone
rented or sold a scooter
to a Mr Otis Falconer

33:14.880 --> 33:16.240
in the last few days.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.120
You mean, right now, Chief?

33:19.200 --> 33:21.080
Well, yes, given this
is a murder investigation.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.920
I think there's some small
degree of urgency.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.400
Right, don't tell me.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.480
Erzulie.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.760
-Erzulie.
-JACK: Okay.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.640
(LAUGHING) Okay.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.600
Ah!

33:36.680 --> 33:38.920
Wow, Dwayne, that smells good.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.440
(BOTH TALKING AT ONCE)

33:40.520 --> 33:42.200
-(DWAYNE EXCLAIMING)
-A tiny bit.

33:44.280 --> 33:46.560
Mmm, what's that you added?
Allspice?

33:46.640 --> 33:51.280
Gives it quite a kick.
I might just, let's get
this in there. Okay.

33:51.360 --> 33:55.200
If you wouldn't mind...
(GROANING IN FRUSTRATION)

33:55.280 --> 33:57.920
My mother used to put allspice
in her Christmas cake.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.080
But, then, one year
she forgot her glasses and
she added black pepper

34:01.160 --> 34:04.720
by mistake.
We were still sneezing
half-way through March.

34:04.800 --> 34:09.120
Chief, please. I'm sorry.
I don't want to be
disrespectful or anything, but

34:09.200 --> 34:13.120
Darlene's gonna be here
at any second.
So, do you think, maybe,

34:13.200 --> 34:17.040
just for one minute you could
possibly give me just a tiny
little bit of space?

34:18.480 --> 34:21.920
Well, of course, Dwayne.
Why didn't you just
say so before?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.040
-I'll get out of your hair.
-Thank you, Chief.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.440
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-(STAMMERS)

34:25.520 --> 34:27.800
-That will be her.
-All right, just pretend
I'm not here.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.040
-Okay.
-I'll be out the back doing

34:29.120 --> 34:30.680
-battle with this.
-Well, go on now.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.840
Yeah. Knock her dead,
Dwayne. I mean,
not literally, obviously.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.600
-That'd be disastrous.
-Chief, go!

34:35.680 --> 34:36.760
Okay.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.760
Happy Erzulie.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.520
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

34:51.760 --> 34:52.960
Hmm.

34:56.720 --> 35:00.680
I got to tell you, Dwayne.
That is one of the best
things I've ever eaten.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.960
(CHUCKLES)

35:02.040 --> 35:05.360
-You must give me the recipe.
-My secret recipe?

35:05.440 --> 35:07.360
You'll have to torture
it out of me.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.600
(CHUCKLES)

35:08.680 --> 35:10.800
Now, that sound
like a challenge.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.560
-You better believe it.
-So what you call it?

35:17.480 --> 35:19.520
I call it sure-thing chicken.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.160
-Do you now?
-Mmm.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.600
And why you call it that?

35:24.720 --> 35:26.600
Erm...

35:26.680 --> 35:31.160
Well, I, I suppose, people
always asking me for my
recipe and I say sure thing,

35:31.240 --> 35:33.840
-you know?
-But, you just said
it was a secret.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.240
Did I?

35:36.800 --> 35:38.320
(LAUGHS)

35:38.400 --> 35:41.880
So it's not because
you're under the illusion
that all this chilli

35:41.960 --> 35:44.240
and spice might put a woman
in a certain mood.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.640
(TOILET FLUSHING)

35:48.240 --> 35:49.320
Who's that?

35:49.400 --> 35:52.360
Er, erm... Oh, that's, erm...

35:55.640 --> 35:58.200
Sorry, ignore me. I'm not here.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.280
Is that an Irish accent I hear?

36:01.360 --> 36:03.200
(DISGUISING ACCENT POORLY)
Eh, No.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.400
(LAUGHS) It is.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.120
A real Irishman.
Like Liam Neeson.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.600
(CHUCKLING) Well, no,
not really like him, I mean,

36:10.680 --> 36:11.760
he's from Ballymena
which is...

36:11.840 --> 36:13.440
You've not been back
there all this time?

36:14.080 --> 36:15.360
Erm...

36:15.440 --> 36:17.800
Look, you must try
some of this chicken.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.800
-No, no, no.
-I insist.

36:20.880 --> 36:24.160
Pull up a chair, honey.
Dwayne, get the man a plate.

36:24.240 --> 36:28.120
-Really, it's not...
-Do not say no to Darlene.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.320
Ah, okay.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.280
-Come.
-(INHALES SHARPLY)

36:32.200 --> 36:34.000
You are going to love this.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.520
It's a sure thing.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.880
Right, Dwayne?

36:39.960 --> 36:44.080
-Right.
-Now, what I need to know is

36:44.160 --> 36:48.880
what is a good-looking
Irishman like yourself doing
alone at Erzulie, hmm?

36:51.560 --> 36:53.000
Anyone for cheesecake?

37:04.640 --> 37:08.840
Who knew there could
be so many scooter shops
on one little island, eh?

37:08.920 --> 37:10.120
This will be number six.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.320
Oh, erm, by the way,
how did it go last night

37:12.400 --> 37:15.560
-with your sure-thing chicken?
-I don't want to talk
about it, okay?

37:15.640 --> 37:17.120
-Hey, Eddie.
-Mmm-hmm?

37:17.200 --> 37:19.880
You rent a scooter to
an Otis Falconer lately?

37:21.520 --> 37:24.800
Yeah, you sure now,
Eddie? Because this is
vitally important.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.840
And we think this Otis
might hold the key to
the Frank O'Toole murder.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.440
Oh!

37:31.520 --> 37:34.880
Chief, we got a description
of Otis. We went to
every scooter shop

37:34.960 --> 37:36.640
-on the island.
-And no one know the name

37:36.720 --> 37:39.400
-Otis Falconer, until...
-We got to the last one.

37:39.480 --> 37:43.320
-Eddie Scooters.
-Now, Eddie is very,
very laid back,

37:43.400 --> 37:45.680
never writes anything down.
Never bothers taking names.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.960
But he said, and I quote,
"This dude in his
thirties or forties,

37:50.040 --> 37:54.720
"maybe British, maybe
Australian, rented a red
scooter, wore a yellow T-shirt,

37:54.800 --> 37:57.960
"was medium built,
and paid a cash deposit."

37:58.040 --> 38:02.480
And get this. He asked Eddie
where Frank O'Toole lived.

38:02.560 --> 38:05.440
-It has to be him.
-Yeah, not the most
detailed description

38:05.520 --> 38:07.120
I've ever heard but
it's got to be.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.920
So who is Otis Falconer?

38:10.000 --> 38:13.520
And what motive could
he have to murder Frank?

38:13.600 --> 38:16.560
A deranged fan or did
Frank owe him money?

38:16.640 --> 38:18.560
Some sort of
military connection?

38:18.640 --> 38:20.680
But we know he has no
footprint on Saint Marie,

38:20.760 --> 38:23.800
so how are we going to find him?

38:23.880 --> 38:27.400
We know he has a boat. So
what's to say he's based
on this island.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.480
Dwayne, JP, run a search on
all the neighbouring islands.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.240
Meanwhile, we'll see
if we can find any more
witnesses back here,

38:33.320 --> 38:36.920
besides Scooter Eddie.
Where's the first place
you'd expect to find a Brit

38:37.000 --> 38:37.960
with a moped?

38:40.840 --> 38:43.320
-I'm afraid I'm not open yet.
-Alas, Catherine,
we're not here

38:43.400 --> 38:46.360
-for a drink.
-We're here on police business.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.480
Oh. Is it something to do
with the Frank O'Toole murder?

38:49.560 --> 38:53.360
Yes, proving to be a puzzle
like something out of
one of his novels.

38:53.440 --> 38:56.960
We're searching for a man
called Otis Falconer.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.560
-Sorry, I don't know that name.
-No one does.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.880
All we know is he's a man
in his thirties of forties,
medium build,

39:02.960 --> 39:05.040
a yellow T-shirt
and a red scooter.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.360
-I think I might know
the man you mean.
-You do?

39:08.440 --> 39:12.840
Yes, he was in here
a couple of days ago
asking if I could recommend

39:12.920 --> 39:16.680
a cheap place to stay.
I sent him to Queenie's
guest house.

39:16.760 --> 39:17.920
Mayor Bordey,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.240
-I think I love you.
-(EXCLAIMS)

39:20.320 --> 39:21.440
(MOUTHING) Thank you.

39:28.920 --> 39:31.200
Okay, you go on up.
I'll keep watch out here.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.360
He's in there.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.520
Otis Falconer. Police,
open up, please.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.000
There he is.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.640
-He's getting away.
-I don't think so.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.800
(MOTOR SPUTTERING)

40:09.600 --> 40:10.720
Oh...

40:12.760 --> 40:17.920
Of course, a potato is best,
but you work with
what you have.

40:18.000 --> 40:23.040
Otis Falconer, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of
the murder of...

40:23.120 --> 40:25.520
Of... Dean Shanks?

40:27.640 --> 40:30.280
Would you rather we called you
Dean or Otis?

40:31.120 --> 40:32.480
Who's Otis?

40:34.040 --> 40:37.240
Otis Falconer is
the identity you assumed
when you landed in

40:37.320 --> 40:40.480
-Saint Marie, two days ago.
-Sorry, I don't...

40:40.560 --> 40:43.280
The thing is Dean, we're not
that inclined to trust you

40:43.360 --> 40:45.240
given that you lied
in a police interview

40:45.320 --> 40:46.760
pretending that you
were in Stoke,

40:46.840 --> 40:49.800
-when in reality...
-I didn't, I mean,
you never asked.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.040
-You... You just assumed.
-You also scarpered

40:53.120 --> 40:57.480
when we tried to question
you just now and I suspect,
your tyre treads are

40:57.560 --> 41:00.480
an exact match for the tracks
we found outside Frank's house.

41:00.560 --> 41:04.600
-I know, I know,
it looks terrible.
-Yeah, not great, to be fair.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.720
This is your chance
to explain yourself.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.080
(SIGHS)

41:10.600 --> 41:12.200
Well, Gilly and me, it's...

41:12.920 --> 41:14.920
I love her, you know...

41:15.000 --> 41:16.560
We were supposed to
be getting married.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.520
I couldn't just give her up
without a fight.

41:19.600 --> 41:23.520
So you flew to Saint Marie,
you hired a scooter,
you asked around till you

41:23.600 --> 41:26.200
found out where Frank lived.
And then?

41:26.280 --> 41:28.840
(SIGHS) Thought I'd go
around there first thing
in the morning,

41:28.920 --> 41:31.040
before everyone else was awake,

41:31.120 --> 41:34.920
find Gilly, say my piece
and when I get there...

41:36.680 --> 41:38.360
DEAN: I don't know,
I just lost my nerve.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.000
I thought...

41:41.080 --> 41:44.320
(SIGHS) "What if I've come
all this way and she just
tells me to get lost?"

41:45.720 --> 41:47.760
So, I bolted.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.320
Feel like a coward.

41:50.400 --> 41:55.040
I'll ask you one last time.
Are you or are you
not Otis Falconer?

41:55.120 --> 41:57.200
I never heard of him, I swear.

42:00.560 --> 42:04.920
We had him. I honestly thought
we had Otis Falconer in custody.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.840
But now he's back to
being nothing more than
a big, fat question mark.

42:08.920 --> 42:12.960
Sir, I just heard back
from Linton Williams,

42:13.040 --> 42:16.640
a rental manager
from Saint Michelle, one of
the neighbouring islands.

42:16.720 --> 42:20.080
Four months ago,
he rented a house to
an Otis Falconer.

42:20.160 --> 42:23.640
And guess what?
He's never met him,
never spoken to him.

42:23.720 --> 42:26.040
It was all done via email.

42:26.120 --> 42:29.960
And apparently this Otis wanted
the most secluded house
he had to offer.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.640
How far is Saint Michelle
from here?

42:31.720 --> 42:33.960
Not far at all,
about five kilometres.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.640
Right, this must be the place.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.520
-Mmm.
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)

42:40.600 --> 42:43.400
-It's the only one here, sir.
-Shh.

-(KNOCKS AT DOOR)
-Otis Falconer.

42:53.080 --> 42:56.800
-(SIGHS)
-Erm...

42:56.880 --> 43:00.600
-Don't we need
a search permit, sir?
-Probably. Don't tell anyone.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.160
I'll say this for Otis.
He doesn't go in for clutter.

43:22.840 --> 43:24.800
-Otis's laptop.
-If there's nothing on it,

43:24.880 --> 43:27.280
let's bag it and check
it for prints.

43:27.360 --> 43:31.120
Frank was killed on the boat.
The boat was bought by Otis.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.600
Otis rented this house.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.880
(SIGHS) What else do we have?

43:35.960 --> 43:38.840
Well, we've got zero motive.
Zero idea who Otis is.

43:38.920 --> 43:41.640
No-one's ever seen
him or spoken to him.

43:41.720 --> 43:46.760
Ah, you're right, Dwayne. Our
number one suspect
is an invisible man.

43:46.840 --> 43:50.120
He's only communicated
with two people on this laptop.

43:50.200 --> 43:54.120
Zeke the Crabman and the
letting agent for this house
and there is no internet

43:54.200 --> 43:56.560
here, so he must have sent
the emails from somewhere else.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.480
(SIGHS) Wow, looks like
we're looking for a ghost.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.600
Mmm.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.560
Or a voodoo goddess.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.080
Except, there's more proof
flipping Erzulie exists.

44:07.680 --> 44:08.880
Maybe, that's it.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.920
What if Otis doesn't exist?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.640
Yeah, what if he was
one of our suspects all along?

44:16.840 --> 44:18.360
(SIGHS)

44:30.760 --> 44:32.720
WOMAN: (ON RADIO) And now,
we come to your luxury.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.280
LARRY: Jack Money.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.840
Frank would never start
until he knew the ending.

44:40.920 --> 44:43.760
They found some tiny fibres
under Frank's fingernails.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.240
He left me this.

44:45.320 --> 44:48.000
As I told you, the golden goose
had stopped laying eggs...

44:48.080 --> 44:50.840
I would give everything to bring
him back again.

44:50.920 --> 44:52.960
I've been working on it,
day and night,
these past two weeks.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.080
There's a good case
and a half of champagne

44:55.160 --> 44:57.920
but Frank didn't think it'd be
enough for the four of you?

44:58.000 --> 45:02.120
Of course, you beauty.
We have to get back to
Saint Marie. Dwayne, when we do,

45:02.200 --> 45:04.000
I need you to check something
with Immigration.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.400
-Will do, Chief.
-What's in a name?

45:06.480 --> 45:09.600
I tell you I'm Jack Mooney.
You take me at my word.

45:09.680 --> 45:13.080
What's the difference between
Jack Mooney and Jack Money?

45:13.160 --> 45:16.080
-The letter O.
-The letter O is
exactly right, JP.

45:16.160 --> 45:21.600
That is it. Yes. It all comes
down to the missing letter O.

45:21.680 --> 45:24.720
I know who Otis Falconer is.
I know who killed Frank O'Toole,

45:24.800 --> 45:26.200
and I know how.

45:29.880 --> 45:34.240
-Gilly.
-Dean, what...
What are you doing here?

45:34.680 --> 45:36.040
(SIGHS)

45:36.120 --> 45:39.800
I flew out here 'cause I
couldn't let you give up on us.

45:39.880 --> 45:41.880
We're meant to be together,
you know we are.

45:41.960 --> 45:46.040
(SIGHS)
You shouldn't have come.
I'm sorry, Dean.

45:51.560 --> 45:52.920
(SIGHS)

45:58.720 --> 46:00.640
The wife, the mistress,
the agent.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.080
The jilted boyfriend

46:03.160 --> 46:07.520
and, then, there's
our fifth suspect who you'll
notice isn't here yet.

46:07.600 --> 46:11.800
Mr Otis Falconer.
But which one of these
five is our killer?

46:12.680 --> 46:15.960
Right. Yes.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.440
With My Little Eye
by Frank O'Toole.

46:18.520 --> 46:20.240
Full disclosure,
I wasn't too sold on

46:20.320 --> 46:23.760
Jim Harvey to begin with.
But, by the end, when Jim
cracks the Russian code,

46:23.840 --> 46:27.720
I have to admit,
the plotting is ingenious.
Yeah.

46:27.800 --> 46:30.320
A real feat of
reverse engineering.

46:30.400 --> 46:33.520
Which put me in mind
to something that Valerie
said, Frank

46:33.600 --> 46:37.480
could never start
writing a novel until he
knew the ending. Yeah?

46:37.560 --> 46:38.560
Yeah.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.920
For Frank, a good plot
was a puzzle.

46:42.920 --> 46:45.800
Er, a code to crack in itself.

46:45.880 --> 46:49.280
It was the letter O
that solved it for me.

46:49.360 --> 46:53.000
Now, we all know the O in
O'Toole was a late addition.

46:53.080 --> 46:56.320
But our man of letters,
he couldn't resist one
last literary flourish.

47:09.960 --> 47:15.240
The last plot he constructed,
the last character he created
was a pseudonym.

47:15.320 --> 47:17.440
But it was also an
anagram of his name.

47:18.560 --> 47:19.760
Otis Falconer.

47:21.760 --> 47:25.000
But why did he feel
the need to create Otis?

47:25.080 --> 47:28.160
Well, the fact is
Frank and Valerie
had run out of money.

47:28.240 --> 47:31.400
And Frank decided that
the only answer was to
fake his own death.

47:34.800 --> 47:37.160
Step one, he'd buy a boat.

47:37.240 --> 47:40.320
Step two, he'd rent a hidey-hole
on a neighbouring island,

47:40.400 --> 47:44.320
filling it with just
the bare essentials.
Clothes, groceries...

47:44.400 --> 47:49.080
JACK: Of course,
English breakfast tea.
His desert island luxury item.

47:49.160 --> 47:51.440
Step three,
on the afternoon of the party...

47:51.520 --> 47:55.840
Champagne stocks look
perilously low. I'll nip in
to town and replenish.

47:55.920 --> 47:58.080
JACK: When he was
supposedly buying champagne,

47:58.160 --> 48:00.480
he preset the boat
into position.

48:01.680 --> 48:02.960
Step four,

48:03.040 --> 48:05.160
the following morning,
a few minutes before 5:00,

48:05.240 --> 48:09.160
he'd leave a note for
his wife before heading
down to the beach.

48:09.240 --> 48:12.840
He'd wave at a fishing boat
just setting out, as it
did every morning

48:12.920 --> 48:17.400
to make sure that he had
witnesses and then, he'd
stride out into the ocean,

48:17.480 --> 48:19.000
never to be seen again.

48:19.880 --> 48:22.800
Missing, presumed drowned.

48:22.880 --> 48:25.080
Being sure to leave behind
a pile of unfinished business.

48:25.160 --> 48:27.440
You know, a contract with
a new agent that
he'd never sign.

48:27.520 --> 48:31.240
And a trip to Prague
that he'd never make
and a novel he'd never finish.

48:31.320 --> 48:34.240
So as nobody would
suspect the truth.
At least, that was the plan,

48:34.320 --> 48:36.520
wasn't it, Valerie?

48:36.600 --> 48:39.400
You knew as a former actress
that you could play the part

48:39.480 --> 48:42.200
of the grieving widow
convincingly,

48:42.280 --> 48:47.760
until it was safe to
join Frank on Saint Michelle,

48:47.840 --> 48:50.440
where you'd spend
the rest of your lives

48:50.520 --> 48:53.440
living off Frank's newly
reinvigorated book sales.

48:55.280 --> 48:58.560
Frank had planned his death,
down to the very last detail.

48:58.640 --> 49:02.560
All except for one tiny,
tiny thing, the dying part.

49:03.680 --> 49:05.120
It was never meant
to end like this.

49:06.400 --> 49:08.160
(SULKS)

49:08.240 --> 49:11.320
He wasn't supposed to die.

49:11.400 --> 49:15.000
No, certainly you didn't mean
for him to die, but you did.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.680
Didn't you, Gilly?

49:22.320 --> 49:24.640
JACK: Frank had already done
all the planning for you.

49:27.080 --> 49:31.040
All you had to do
was swim out ahead
of him and lie in wait.

49:36.760 --> 49:37.880
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

49:37.960 --> 49:39.480
(NERVOUSLY)
This is ridiculous.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.680
Why would I wanna kill Frank?

49:42.760 --> 49:45.040
Well, because you were
head over heels in
love with him.

49:46.080 --> 49:48.640
Up till now,
you'd barely left Stoke.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.600
And here you were in paradise
with a man that you idolised.

49:51.680 --> 49:56.320
Reading your words and sharing
your bed. Dean told us how
obsessive you can be.

49:56.400 --> 50:00.280
He thought it was your
novel you were obsessed by,
but really it was Frank.

50:00.360 --> 50:04.520
And you believed that Frank
felt the same way.

50:04.600 --> 50:09.040
JACK: I mean, what were
the tickets to Prague,
if not a declaration of love?

50:09.120 --> 50:13.120
You had no idea that
they were just another of
Frank's red herrings.

50:13.200 --> 50:17.960
Until last weekend, believing
they had safely dispatched
you to Montserrat.

50:18.040 --> 50:19.880
We had to send her
off to Montserrat

50:19.960 --> 50:22.480
last weekend,
just so that we could breathe.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.280
Frank and Valerie
were finally able

50:24.360 --> 50:26.520
to talk about their plan
out in the open.

50:26.600 --> 50:29.760
The hardest part is swimming
out to the boat.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.800
The hardest part will be living
without you for six months.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.760
Little did they know that
you hadn't gone to Montserrat.

50:38.840 --> 50:42.200
We checked with Immigration
and you never left the island.

50:42.280 --> 50:45.680
Instead, you decided
to stay behind and work
on your novel.

50:45.760 --> 50:49.640
I've been working on it,
day and night,
these past two weeks.

50:49.720 --> 50:52.480
JACK: Which is when we assume
that you overheard
the conversation

50:52.560 --> 50:54.480
and you became suspicious.

50:54.560 --> 50:57.160
FLORENCE: You must have
started snooping around,
which is when you

50:57.240 --> 50:59.440
discovered Frank's laptop

50:59.520 --> 51:03.440
and that would have revealed
the existence of two things.

51:03.520 --> 51:07.560
A boat and a hideaway
on a nearby island.

51:07.640 --> 51:10.880
JACK: For someone with
such a deep-rooted fear
of rejection

51:10.960 --> 51:12.520
this must have
been unbearable.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.880
Her last book got rejected
by fifteen publishers

51:14.960 --> 51:17.240
and she was terrified
it would happen again.

51:17.320 --> 51:19.800
It wasn't Dean
who tore this up, was it?

51:20.440 --> 51:21.520
It was you.

51:27.520 --> 51:31.440
You were prepared to give up
everything for Frank.

51:31.520 --> 51:34.360
And then you realised that
the only woman that he
was truly in love with,

51:35.880 --> 51:39.680
the woman he was planning
a future with, was his wife.

51:40.880 --> 51:42.640
So on the afternoon
of the party...

51:42.720 --> 51:47.520
Champagne stocks look
perilously low. I'll nip in
to town and replenish.

51:47.600 --> 51:50.520
You knew going to
buy champagne
was just a ruse.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.320
You do most of
the catering in here.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.280
You knew exactly
how much champagne
was in that cupboard.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.640
So you followed Frank.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.520
And you discovered exactly
where the boat would be.

52:08.920 --> 52:11.760
Then, after that all you had
to do was feign drunkenness

52:11.840 --> 52:15.560
to put everyone off
the scent. Swim out to
the boat and lie in wait.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.200
This is ridiculous.

52:19.240 --> 52:20.320
You've got no proof.

52:22.120 --> 52:25.240
Well, except for
a small grey boat,

52:25.320 --> 52:27.840
the paint on which
exactly matches

52:27.920 --> 52:32.200
the paint fibres that we found
under Frank's fingernails.

52:32.280 --> 52:34.040
And I've no doubt that
our lab will confirm

52:34.120 --> 52:36.520
that you left your
DNA all over it...

52:38.520 --> 52:41.120

52:41.880 --> 52:43.560
-(GRUNTS)
-(GROANS)

52:51.920 --> 52:55.200
Before setting the boat
adrift, hoping that it
would never be found,

52:55.280 --> 52:58.800
hoping that you might, indeed,
get away with murder.

(SIGHS)

53:04.800 --> 53:08.120
(GASPS AND SIGHS)

53:08.200 --> 53:10.080
After everything
he did for you.

53:10.880 --> 53:12.320
Did for me?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.360
He destroyed my life.

53:15.440 --> 53:18.200
Oh, I was happy when
I met him, but then he had
to let me believe that

53:18.280 --> 53:21.160
I was special,
that I had talent,

53:21.960 --> 53:23.200
that he loved me.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.520
Something you knew!

53:26.520 --> 53:28.320
Frank felt nothing for you.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.760
How could he?

53:32.400 --> 53:33.560
You're a monster.

53:49.840 --> 53:52.280
DI Money, erm, Mooney.
Mooney, sorry, sorry.

53:52.360 --> 53:54.640
I just wanted to apologise
to you for doubting you.

53:54.720 --> 53:57.280
I see now that
there is a certain
method in your madness.

53:57.360 --> 54:00.160
Oh, well, thank you.
What are you going
to do now, Larry?

54:00.240 --> 54:01.960
On the hunt for another
golden goose?

54:02.040 --> 54:05.560
O, no, no, no,
as you pointed out,
the irony is

54:05.640 --> 54:08.160
that now the old sod's
gonna keep me
busier than ever.

54:08.240 --> 54:12.520
But it seems to me that
you have a certain gift
for spinning a yarn.

54:12.600 --> 54:15.120
If you ever decide
to turn to writing,

54:16.640 --> 54:19.000
give me a call.

54:19.080 --> 54:23.920
-Well, I'll bear it in mind.
-I mean it now. Bye.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.280
(SIGHS)

54:32.600 --> 54:37.000
Why is she still up?
Thought I'd seen
the last of her.

54:37.080 --> 54:40.360
Even when you
can't see Erzulie,
she's always there.

54:40.440 --> 54:44.280
Tricking people into
falling in love,
so she can break their hearts.

54:44.360 --> 54:46.040
You're not really
that cynical, are you?

54:47.160 --> 54:48.920
What have we just seen?

54:49.000 --> 54:52.880
One man dead,
two lives ruined, by what?

54:52.960 --> 54:56.400
Well, it wasn't love
that killed them.
It was envy.

54:56.480 --> 55:00.080
Precisely because in its
own way Frank and Valerie's
love was the real deal.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.800
The kind of love that
nothing can break,

55:01.880 --> 55:05.400
not infidelity, not time,
not even death.

55:05.480 --> 55:08.480
-Does that really exist?
-Oh, it does, trust me.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.080
Talking of which...

55:25.000 --> 55:28.880
It was such a lovely
surprise to receive
your voicemail.

55:28.960 --> 55:33.840

I'm just gonna listen to
your lovely Irish voice

-cooing in my ear.
-Oh, that's great.

55:37.040 --> 55:40.960
Well, the reason I asked you
here, Darlene, is because,
well,

55:41.040 --> 55:43.920
last night I feel
I interrupted something.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.840
Now, seemed to me
that you were striking

55:45.920 --> 55:48.160
sparks off each other
and that's rare.

55:48.240 --> 55:49.680
You don't seem too convinced,

55:49.760 --> 55:51.080
but frankly you should
be because

55:51.160 --> 55:52.760
Dwayne has got a good heart

55:52.840 --> 55:54.320
and a great sense of humour

55:54.400 --> 55:55.920

You got to give him
a fair crack at the whip.

any more, but maybe

56:09.960 --> 56:12.280
