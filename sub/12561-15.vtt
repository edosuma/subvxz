WEBVTT

00:01.843 --> 00:04.638
That's the guy who donated
his kidney to his housekeeper.

00:04.639 --> 00:06.260
You're engaged and I knew that.

00:06.261 --> 00:09.116
When we kissed, I don't know,
it just... it felt good.

00:09.630 --> 00:10.452
...and right.

00:10.453 --> 00:13.098
I felt nothing except regret.

00:13.099 --> 00:14.754
I became involved with a patient,

00:14.755 --> 00:18.152
and I will in no way continue
to treat him medically.

00:18.153 --> 00:19.472
What I care about is you.

00:19.473 --> 00:21.430
- Are you okay?
- No.

00:21.431 --> 00:23.834
- What do you make of Emily?
- I'm still feeling her out.

00:23.835 --> 00:26.384
Divya's getting married
in four weeks, so...

00:26.385 --> 00:28.687
What would you think
about joining HankMed?

00:29.783 --> 00:31.232
You don't know my father.

00:31.233 --> 00:32.942
Retired general William Collins,

00:32.943 --> 00:35.655
currently the CEO of
a Fortune 500 defense contractor,

00:35.656 --> 00:37.555
who you feel will one day
run for president.

00:37.556 --> 00:39.886
You are not Paige Collins material.

00:39.887 --> 00:42.661
You're weak, clumsy, unfocused.

00:42.662 --> 00:45.235
You're not someone
who'd be taken seriously in her circles.

00:45.236 --> 00:46.867
You completely took advantage,

00:46.868 --> 00:49.496
and you can't just charm
your way out of this.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:47.537 --> 01:49.933
Damn it, what the hell's wrong
with you, boy?

01:49.934 --> 01:52.934
Oh, boy. Uh, nothing, general, sir.

01:53.215 --> 01:55.123
Um, please don't shoot me again.

01:55.124 --> 01:56.817
You're lucky I'm unarmed.

01:57.224 --> 01:58.956
I thought you were my crazy neighbor.

01:58.957 --> 02:01.650
No. Uh, no. I'm just here to apologize

02:01.651 --> 02:02.758
to your daughter, sir.

02:03.595 --> 02:05.562
Not that I dishonored her at all.

02:05.563 --> 02:08.537
Your recon skills are sorely lacking.

02:08.877 --> 02:10.544
Not to mention your grammar.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.840
Yeah, they shorted me on rose petals,

02:14.220 --> 02:15.968
and "I'm sorry" just...

02:16.173 --> 02:19.491
Son, you have exactly five seconds
to clear off my lawn.

02:20.034 --> 02:22.829
All due respect, sir, but I...

02:30.494 --> 02:32.179
I tried to warn you, Lawson.

02:33.514 --> 02:35.227
Now, clean all that up.

02:44.184 --> 02:45.940
Sorry about the potholes on the way in.

02:45.941 --> 02:47.027
We wanted to repave the road,

02:47.028 --> 02:48.685
but we share it with our neighbor!

02:48.686 --> 02:50.538
Stop, he might hear you.

02:50.539 --> 02:52.909
He's a retired general.
He likes to shoot things.

02:52.910 --> 02:55.035
Oh, let him hear.
He's not gonna shoot us.

02:55.036 --> 02:56.537
You see that old shack down there?

02:56.538 --> 02:57.251
Uh-huh.

02:57.506 --> 02:58.753
We had to go to court to prove

02:58.754 --> 03:00.378
it was actually on our property.

03:00.379 --> 03:01.605
We wanted to tear it down.

03:01.606 --> 03:03.333
Yeah, then the old general gets it put

03:03.334 --> 03:04.655
on the historic registry.

03:04.656 --> 03:06.133
So we own it, but we can't touch it.

03:06.134 --> 03:08.096
Anyways, this isn't why
we called you over here.

03:08.097 --> 03:09.115
I was hoping you'd say that.

03:09.116 --> 03:11.194
I don't prescribe
for Hatfield-McCoy syndrome.

03:11.589 --> 03:13.894
So your daughter has a sore throat?

03:13.895 --> 03:16.750
Natalie. She's recording
an album this summer.

03:17.186 --> 03:20.536
♪ You were a cold, cold boy. ♪

03:21.086 --> 03:23.532
Her sore throat may not
be a medical mystery.

03:23.533 --> 03:25.541
She sings a lot.

03:25.542 --> 03:28.639
But she also caught mono
from a boy this winter.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.554
A 16-year-old... with an eyebrow ring.

03:32.540 --> 03:35.974
I'm just not sure whether
she's downplaying real symptoms,

03:37.361 --> 03:40.839
or faking so she can bail
and get back to the city.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.115
She wanted to hang in the city all summer

03:42.116 --> 03:43.771
with eyebrow boy,

03:43.772 --> 03:45.588
but we bribed her out here
with this recording project.

03:45.589 --> 03:47.027
With teens, sometimes
it's better for them

03:47.028 --> 03:48.466
to see a doctor one on one.

03:48.467 --> 03:50.089
Well, she's certainly
not gonna say anything

03:50.090 --> 03:51.204
in front of us.

03:55.460 --> 03:58.112
For the record, I hate needles.

03:58.335 --> 04:00.323
Really? 'Cause most folks love 'em.

04:00.821 --> 04:02.320
Did they turn you into a pin cushion

04:02.321 --> 04:03.249
when you were sick?

04:03.403 --> 04:05.121
What is a pin cushion?

04:05.654 --> 04:07.331
A cushion for pins.

04:07.505 --> 04:09.100
Sometimes shaped like a tomato.

04:09.570 --> 04:12.145
- My mom had one.
- Oh, like from the old days.

04:12.146 --> 04:14.167
Yeah. She kept it by the butter churn.

04:14.168 --> 04:15.456
Open up, please.

04:16.437 --> 04:17.807
What's with the giant q-tip?

04:18.002 --> 04:20.488
I'm doing a rapid strep test. 
Open.

04:20.706 --> 04:23.193
And making sure your mono isn't back.

04:23.355 --> 04:25.935
But you have no fever, no abdominal pain,

04:25.936 --> 04:28.792
so I'm thinking it's just a virus

04:29.005 --> 04:30.460
and some strained vocal cords.

04:30.641 --> 04:32.086
You been singing a lot this summer?

04:32.087 --> 04:33.179
I wouldn't be singing at all

04:33.180 --> 04:34.963
if my parents had let me stay in the city.

04:35.143 --> 04:37.736
You should tell them that,
since they want to run my life.

04:37.737 --> 04:39.384
Natalie, you're my patient.

04:39.385 --> 04:40.709
I'm not gonna tell your parents anything

04:40.710 --> 04:42.091
without your permission.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.864
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

04:43.865 --> 04:46.177
Yeah, unless we discover
something life-endangering,

04:46.178 --> 04:47.281
which I don't expect.

04:47.282 --> 04:48.912
How come the pediatrician
talked to my parents

04:48.913 --> 04:50.053
all winter?

04:50.054 --> 04:51.642
Well, you were much younger then.

04:53.121 --> 04:54.937
I'm also gonna prescribe some steroids.

04:54.938 --> 04:56.660
No way, man. I play clean.

04:56.661 --> 04:58.638
Not the performance-enhancing kind.

04:58.639 --> 05:00.644
These will reduce the swelling
in your throat.

05:00.645 --> 05:03.189
And I'm gonna prescribe
a few days of vocal rest.

05:19.595 --> 05:20.861
Dad?

05:22.451 --> 05:23.711
You here?

05:25.265 --> 05:26.317
Dad?

05:28.167 --> 05:29.327
- That's good.
- Yeah?

05:29.328 --> 05:30.533
- Uh-huh.
- How's it sounding?

05:30.534 --> 05:31.761
It's sounding pretty good.

05:33.012 --> 05:34.366
Well, hello there.

05:34.845 --> 05:37.601
Hank. Now, that's a surprise.

05:37.602 --> 05:39.354
I was just thinking the same thing.

05:39.734 --> 05:42.797
This is the 1:00 you canceled
our lunch for?

05:42.798 --> 05:44.211
I'm afraid so.

05:44.415 --> 05:45.995
Well, you know, I needed a doctor,

05:45.996 --> 05:49.571
and you yourself said to me
that treating family members

05:49.572 --> 05:51.827
isn't... what is the word you used?

05:51.828 --> 05:53.013
"Optimal."

05:53.014 --> 05:55.711
Right. I was recommending you stay
with Dr. Starnes

05:55.712 --> 05:57.073
as your cardiologist.

05:57.074 --> 05:58.794
I am. I did. I love him.

05:58.795 --> 06:00.793
This is much more routine.

06:01.115 --> 06:02.526
What kind of routine?

06:03.005 --> 06:06.035
I'd be happy to discuss it
with your father's consent.

06:09.799 --> 06:10.800
Are you seriously pulling

06:10.801 --> 06:13.032
doctor-patient confidentiality on me?

06:16.068 --> 06:17.147
Sorry.

06:51.301 --> 06:53.562
I asked you flat out, and you said

06:53.563 --> 06:55.430
that there would be enough
petals to spell it.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.286
What do you mean "lower case"?

06:57.287 --> 06:59.135
Who apologizes in lower case?

06:59.434 --> 07:02.319
Look, look, look, next time
I'm apologizing to somebody,

07:02.320 --> 07:04.154
and I have to spell something out
in rose petals,

07:04.155 --> 07:05.462
I'm taking my business elsewhere.

07:05.463 --> 07:06.495
Okay, buddy?

07:08.976 --> 07:10.274
Well, that's telling him.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.821
Have any faxes come in for me?

07:13.029 --> 07:15.265
I am expecting
a revised hors d'oeuvres list

07:15.266 --> 07:16.554
from my wedding planner.

07:16.555 --> 07:18.136
I don't know.
I barely check them anymore.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.131
Faxes are so last century, divs.

07:20.132 --> 07:22.993
Said the man apologizing by rose petal.

07:23.678 --> 07:25.660
It's just the 19 text messages I sent

07:25.661 --> 07:26.855
didn't really work, so...

07:27.096 --> 07:29.557
Do you know you could shop
by text message?

07:32.615 --> 07:34.121
Please be here to forgive me.

07:34.893 --> 07:38.790
Oh, Evan, I forgave you
two edible arrangements ago.

07:39.330 --> 07:40.998
And why didn't you tell me that?

07:41.176 --> 07:43.414
Because the stuff you were doing
was so cute.

07:43.682 --> 07:46.379
I kinda wanted to see
what you were gonna come up with next.

07:46.614 --> 07:48.844
Until I got this.

07:49.112 --> 07:50.252
Oh, my God.

07:50.931 --> 07:52.870
Hot appies more expensive
than you thought?

07:52.871 --> 07:53.914
No, it's...

07:56.405 --> 07:57.630
I mean, yes.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.789
They're just off the charts.

08:03.924 --> 08:05.972
So please tell me these are from you

08:05.973 --> 08:09.728
- and not a stalker.
- They are... What?

08:11.326 --> 08:13.320
- Who's Roy Ramis?
- I don't know.

08:14.168 --> 08:15.441
Wait a minute.

08:21.248 --> 08:22.905
"I am sorry."

08:23.821 --> 08:25.335
How did they get like that?

08:27.148 --> 08:28.378
You.

08:28.858 --> 08:30.111
Me.

08:34.897 --> 08:36.702
- Do me a favor?
- Yeah.

08:36.703 --> 08:38.657
Hang out with me
at my parents' house today.

08:38.658 --> 08:41.592
- Why, they out of town?
- Well, my mom is.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.910
So the general wants me there

08:43.912 --> 08:45.759
to greet his buddies, who are coming in

08:45.760 --> 08:47.288
for some kind of a summit.

08:47.479 --> 08:49.241
Not that I know what to say

08:49.242 --> 08:51.040
to a bunch of defense contractors.

08:51.041 --> 08:53.566
"Congratulations
on all your global conflicts"?

08:53.567 --> 08:54.733
Well, don't worry, we're gonna be

08:54.734 --> 08:56.233
in another part of the house.

08:56.234 --> 08:58.036
Well, actually, we have to be,

08:58.037 --> 09:00.230
without background checks.

09:00.786 --> 09:03.818
- No, I'm serious.
- Whoa.

09:08.743 --> 09:11.578
Look, Natalie, I need to hear
what's going on from you.

09:11.772 --> 09:14.480
Anything besides the nausea,
pain, diarrhea?

09:14.697 --> 09:17.136
Eww. A little.

09:17.831 --> 09:20.221
- But my throat feels better.
- Okay.

09:20.222 --> 09:23.226
Can I sing now, Dr. Lawson?
Pretty please.

09:23.227 --> 09:25.091
Not yet, Natalie. I'm sorry.

09:25.345 --> 09:27.568
- And, uh, call me Hank.
- Hank?

09:27.569 --> 09:29.157
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure you're a doctor?

09:29.268 --> 09:31.511
Last I checked. Please.

09:31.891 --> 09:33.348
So try to get a lot of fluids,

09:33.349 --> 09:35.034
and I'll give you something for the nausea.

09:35.269 --> 09:37.436
Now, the last two things.

09:37.677 --> 09:40.846
Number one, and number two.

09:41.408 --> 09:42.529
Eww.

09:43.045 --> 09:44.935
If you're looking for drugs and babies,

09:44.936 --> 09:46.436
you're gonna be disappointed.

09:46.623 --> 09:48.393
My parents think I've gone off the deep e,

09:48.394 --> 09:51.074
but I'm still pretty much just a band geek.

09:51.075 --> 09:52.339
I like geeks.

09:52.637 --> 09:54.747
I was a med school geek once myself.

09:55.824 --> 09:57.628
And I'm not just looking
for drugs and babies.

09:57.843 --> 10:00.529
I'm also looking for amoebas and parasites.

10:02.115 --> 10:04.006
I know...Eww!

10:16.990 --> 10:18.275
Hey, stranger.

10:18.461 --> 10:19.358
Hey.

10:20.239 --> 10:22.135
Uh, hello.

10:22.886 --> 10:25.939
I don't think I've ever
been happier to be lied to.

10:28.374 --> 10:31.031
When you told me you never wanted
to see me again.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.261
And here you are.

10:34.270 --> 10:37.777
HankMed is still listed
as your doctor of record.

10:39.110 --> 10:42.388
We were copied on the labs
your nephrologist ran.

10:44.256 --> 10:45.985
Did something happen?

10:46.714 --> 10:47.990
Yes.

10:48.158 --> 10:49.458
With your engagement?

10:51.643 --> 10:52.784
No.

10:54.199 --> 10:56.224
It's your urinalysis.

10:57.359 --> 10:59.982
It showed an increase in protein and casts.

10:59.983 --> 11:01.597
I want to examine you for...

11:01.598 --> 11:02.679
Wait, wait, I'm...

11:05.683 --> 11:07.154
This is a medical call.

11:08.039 --> 11:09.155
Yes.

11:09.506 --> 11:11.122
Adam, your numbers are...

11:11.123 --> 11:13.791
They're something
that my doctor is aware of.

11:16.936 --> 11:20.519
I respected your feelings.
Please respect mine.

11:21.584 --> 11:23.057
I can't be near you without...

11:23.058 --> 11:24.740
Okay, you know what, I'm sorry.

11:24.741 --> 11:27.026
But it is important that you follow up.

11:27.027 --> 11:28.232
I... I will.

11:29.131 --> 11:31.152
And I'll have my medical records changed

11:31.398 --> 11:33.005
so you aren't bothered again.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.557
- Hello?
- Hey, where are you?

11:41.072 --> 11:42.786
Leaving a patient. What's up?

11:43.068 --> 11:44.440
Well, I'm spending the day with Paige,

11:44.441 --> 11:46.053
but if you'd like to play tennis with dad,

11:46.054 --> 11:47.082
he's short a partner.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.311
Wait, wait, wait. Dr. Starnes
approved tennis?

11:49.546 --> 11:51.406
Well, what dad calls tennis, yeah.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.502
But did you notice any injuries

11:53.503 --> 11:55.290
or other medical factors?

11:55.291 --> 11:57.268
Other than being old and slow?

11:57.269 --> 11:58.723
No. Why?

11:58.724 --> 12:02.365
I recently became aware
of another physician treating him.

12:02.849 --> 12:04.649
The one writing him
the get-out-of-jail-free card?

12:04.650 --> 12:05.716
He found someone?

12:05.948 --> 12:07.378
His get-out-of-jail...
His what?

12:07.817 --> 12:09.608
The other doctor.
The doctor that he was...

12:10.651 --> 12:12.323
Evan, please continue.

12:13.391 --> 12:14.265
Damn it!

12:14.539 --> 12:17.005
Um, you know, the...
Uh-oh...

12:17.341 --> 12:19.985
I'm having trouble hearing you.
Are you talking right now?

12:20.189 --> 12:21.768
Henr... uh... ish... connection.

12:21.769 --> 12:22.995
And I'm... uh... ohh... a...

12:22.996 --> 12:24.037
I know you're doing the thing

12:24.038 --> 12:25.993
where you fake
like you're losing reception.

12:25.994 --> 12:27.328
- Uh... go... trough a canyon...
- I know the trick.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.551
Hello? Evan!

12:28.892 --> 12:30.343
I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to hang up.

12:30.344 --> 12:32.302
Uh... oh... be... cru...

12:35.487 --> 12:36.698
Can you hear me now?

12:36.880 --> 12:39.149
Your patient's the general's
crazy neighbor?

12:39.150 --> 12:40.504
You're changing the subject.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.664
I forget what the subject is.

12:42.665 --> 12:45.247
Dad using a doctor to avoid sentencing.
What do...

12:45.248 --> 12:47.571
Oh, yeah, that.
Yeah, maybe you should talk to dad.

12:47.917 --> 12:49.660
Ev... Evan. Evan!

12:49.661 --> 12:51.509
I will find you!

12:53.415 --> 12:55.731
He's a child. My brother's a child.

13:00.696 --> 13:01.440
Thank you.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.491
This is awesome!

13:42.929 --> 13:45.316
What the heck?

13:51.096 --> 13:52.717
Oh, come on, are you kidding me?

13:54.307 --> 13:55.326
Come on.

13:56.634 --> 13:57.857
Oh, my God.

14:07.178 --> 14:08.153
Great.

14:08.470 --> 14:10.918
Gentlemen... make yourselves comfortable.

14:11.523 --> 14:12.999
I'll break out some bourbon.

14:13.457 --> 14:15.764
All right, let's hear it.

14:15.959 --> 14:17.888
All social and economic indicators

14:17.889 --> 14:20.961
point to a restless,
dissatisfied population

14:20.962 --> 14:22.517
desperate for change.

14:22.565 --> 14:24.372
The north is a given.

14:24.373 --> 14:26.754
But we'd encounter
resistance in the east.

14:26.755 --> 14:29.760
But with an all-out blitz, I'm confident

14:29.761 --> 14:31.275
I'm confident
that we can take major cities.

14:31.276 --> 14:32.964
- Contingent, of course...
- Holy crap.

14:32.965 --> 14:34.703
On your willingness to take the reins.

14:34.704 --> 14:38.412
Well, that's the $64 question, isn't it?

14:48.657 --> 14:51.434
Gentlemen, I'm intrigued.

14:52.463 --> 14:54.250
But I'm not convinced.

14:54.512 --> 14:57.208
And just to be clear, until I am,

14:58.313 --> 15:00.081
this meeting never happened.

15:20.324 --> 15:21.911
Hey, I need to run a differential.

15:22.566 --> 15:23.695
Well, of course.

15:23.975 --> 15:27.642
14-year-old musical dynamo...
sore throat, swollen glands,

15:27.643 --> 15:30.846
vomiting, not pregnant,
no strep, o&p looks clean.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.296
She recently recovered from mono,

15:32.297 --> 15:33.715
but that came back negative too.

15:33.716 --> 15:36.156
Well, a mono spot test
can show a false negative.

15:36.157 --> 15:37.998
Yeah, it can. I'll re-test in a week.

15:38.811 --> 15:41.570
And if she has the Epstein-Barr virus,

15:41.571 --> 15:44.334
she could develop chronic fatigue syndrome.

15:45.071 --> 15:46.321
Yeah, which could cut

15:46.322 --> 15:48.328
a promising musical career short.

15:49.039 --> 15:50.330
I want another look.

15:50.727 --> 15:52.014
Are you headed there now?

15:52.209 --> 15:53.686
Yeah, right after I clear up something

15:53.687 --> 15:55.310
with one of my father's doctors.

15:55.311 --> 15:56.887
May I get your read on something?

15:56.888 --> 15:59.857
- Sure.
- Adam Pierce's test results.

16:00.020 --> 16:01.115
Did you see them?

16:01.249 --> 16:02.830
Yeah. I'm glad he found a specialist.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.460
Do you think it's nephrotic syndrome?

16:06.062 --> 16:07.147
Possibly.

16:08.059 --> 16:09.634
I left a few messages,

16:09.837 --> 16:11.528
but his doctor is at a conference.

16:11.719 --> 16:14.763
And I feel that a timely
follow-up is crucial.

16:14.852 --> 16:17.565
Mm-hmm. Divya, when should
we stop pretending

16:17.566 --> 16:20.007
I don't know Adam's the patient
you became involved with?

16:23.586 --> 16:26.126
- How about now?
- Now's good.

16:27.453 --> 16:28.370
Good.

16:29.387 --> 16:32.734
Okay, look, Adam shows no signs of edema...

16:32.735 --> 16:34.323
Wait, wait, wait.
You called him?

16:35.278 --> 16:36.583
You treated him?

16:37.429 --> 16:39.041
Divya, you told me you wouldn't.

16:39.042 --> 16:40.659
I know. I did.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.906
But his increased proteins and casts

16:42.907 --> 16:44.047
were a frightening development.

16:44.048 --> 16:45.730
Adam's results are concerning.

16:46.245 --> 16:48.952
They're only frightening
to someone emotionally involved.

16:48.953 --> 16:50.549
I was worried.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.215
- Promise me you won't...
- I won't.

16:54.754 --> 16:56.807
I won't see him.

16:57.014 --> 16:58.481
Whether you see him or not
is your business.

16:58.482 --> 17:00.180
And if you want to talk about that, we can.

17:00.963 --> 17:03.466
But as part of HankMed,
you cannot treat him.

17:04.387 --> 17:05.719
I will follow up.

17:05.877 --> 17:06.974
Understood?

17:10.279 --> 17:11.088
Okay.

17:31.566 --> 17:34.079
Why is my fight or flight instinct
kicking in?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.254
Which one are you leaning towards?

17:37.121 --> 17:38.776
Flight, but I'm exhausted.

17:39.866 --> 17:41.491
Look, you treating my dad...

17:43.441 --> 17:45.224
The whole thing is bad in every way.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.429
He called me and asked me for my help.

17:47.430 --> 17:48.443
Yeah, when my dad's in a jam,

17:48.444 --> 17:50.166
he can be very persuasive.

17:50.167 --> 17:51.881
That doesn't mean you have to be persuaded.

17:51.882 --> 17:54.904
Please, I want to help. You and him.

17:56.802 --> 17:58.078
I would have killed for a father

17:58.079 --> 17:59.489
who cares the way yours does.

17:59.715 --> 18:01.598
Okay. Only in this case,

18:01.599 --> 18:03.493
it's never quite clear
who he's caring about more,

18:03.494 --> 18:04.872
us or him.

18:04.989 --> 18:07.714
Look, Hank, he's a sweet man
with a heart condition,

18:07.715 --> 18:09.389
who owes the government some money.

18:09.570 --> 18:10.805
Wow, you sound just like him.

18:10.944 --> 18:12.561
Minimizing, justifying.

18:12.703 --> 18:14.475
Oh, my God, I'm dating my father.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.583
There's a take on the oedipal complex

18:16.584 --> 18:17.597
I haven't heard.

18:17.747 --> 18:19.260
Look, I want my dad to catch a break.

18:19.428 --> 18:21.042
I do. But not at your expense.

18:21.228 --> 18:22.293
I mean, thank you.

18:22.294 --> 18:24.381
Thank you for wanting
to help him... and me.

18:24.382 --> 18:25.130
Really.

18:25.682 --> 18:28.215
But we can't diagnose what a patient wants,

18:28.586 --> 18:30.063
or even what we want.

18:31.045 --> 18:34.258
No matter how sweet he is,
we report what we see.

18:34.418 --> 18:37.209
We do. And we make judgment calls.

18:37.210 --> 18:38.753
Yeah, but we don't make things up.

18:39.249 --> 18:41.434
I mean, my dad's playing three sets
of tennis a day

18:41.435 --> 18:42.183
in public.

18:42.184 --> 18:44.357
Did you spin the recovery time
on his stress test?

18:44.358 --> 18:45.858
Did you even do a stress test?

18:45.859 --> 18:47.463
I did my job, Hank.

18:48.436 --> 18:49.901
And you're welcome.

19:16.171 --> 19:18.737
Give me the secret code,
or I can't let you out.

19:18.738 --> 19:19.586
Paige?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.044
- Paige...
- Why didn't you text me sooner?

19:25.045 --> 19:26.352
How long were you in there?

19:26.353 --> 19:28.430
I... I wasn't in there.
I was never in there.

19:28.431 --> 19:29.861
I was never here.
I'm gonna go home right now.

19:29.862 --> 19:31.329
Oh, you overheard daddy's meeting.

19:32.197 --> 19:34.633
Okay, Paige, daddy...

19:35.209 --> 19:37.493
He's plotting the overthrow
of some unsuspecting country.

19:37.494 --> 19:39.835
Yeah, I know. Our country.

19:39.836 --> 19:41.510
Okay, now, don't tell me. I don't...

19:41.511 --> 19:43.472
La la la la!

19:43.473 --> 19:45.126
Through elections, Evan.

19:45.127 --> 19:47.945
Those guys are here to woo him
into running.

19:50.946 --> 19:52.066
I thought...

19:52.348 --> 19:53.790
For what?
For president?

19:54.040 --> 19:56.962
Bite your tongue. Okay?
It's only the senate.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.889
But even that would ruin my life.

19:59.069 --> 20:02.027
Can you see me wrapped in an American flag?

20:03.892 --> 20:04.598
I'm picturing it.

20:04.599 --> 20:06.774
It's totally rocking my vote, yeah.

20:06.775 --> 20:07.872
Thank you.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.738
But those guys, they'll never convince him.

20:10.739 --> 20:12.656
All right, daddy is a man of the troops.

20:12.657 --> 20:14.439
He's not a politician.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.794
The only way he'll run
is if the public drafts him.

20:17.795 --> 20:20.693
And with that gruff personality he puts on,

20:20.694 --> 20:22.427
it's just not gonna happen.

20:22.428 --> 20:24.683
I don't think that's "put on."

20:25.938 --> 20:29.083
Whoa... What is that?

20:29.084 --> 20:31.160
Dad's cronies throwing him a rager?

20:31.161 --> 20:32.636
No, it's the neighbors.

20:32.637 --> 20:35.757
But there will be rage. Come on.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.899
Move the table to the porch, please.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.488
Thank you.

20:48.545 --> 20:51.165
See, daddy, easy as pie.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.559
Listen to that noise.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.087
We use stuff like that to flush insurgents

20:56.088 --> 20:58.085
out of their hidey-holes.

20:58.086 --> 21:00.280
- But...
- Damn it!

21:00.281 --> 21:02.762
I wanted to show the boys
where I do my tanning.

21:02.763 --> 21:03.316
That's funny, I was actually...

21:03.317 --> 21:04.760
I was gonna compliment you on that.

21:04.761 --> 21:06.575
You have, like, a natural,
healthy glow to you.

21:06.576 --> 21:08.894
Not that kind of...

21:10.156 --> 21:12.713
- I tan animal hides, Lawson.
- Oh.

21:12.714 --> 21:15.041
- Use what I kill.
- Right.

21:15.042 --> 21:17.611
Patton, MacArthur, come on, somewhere else.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.962
Those crazies next door,

21:19.963 --> 21:22.787
they put some kind of a generator
in the candle house.

21:22.788 --> 21:26.300
They've got cords running up
to power that infernal racket!

21:26.301 --> 21:27.955
It's a sacrilege!

21:28.802 --> 21:30.383
Okay, that does it.

21:30.384 --> 21:32.302
Evan and I are gonna go over there

21:32.303 --> 21:34.131
and ask them to turn it down.

21:34.132 --> 21:35.251
- Yeah. Okay? Yeah.
- Okay?

21:35.252 --> 21:38.106
Son, keep your eye open

21:38.107 --> 21:40.778
for any further renovations afoot.

21:40.779 --> 21:42.247
Anything.

21:42.248 --> 21:44.873
Can do, sir. Thank you, sir.

21:44.874 --> 21:48.731
Consider yourself my unmanned drone.

21:53.892 --> 21:57.801
Are you sure you feel better,
'cause your throat looks worse.

21:57.802 --> 22:00.648
Yeah, the lesions on your throat
are redder,

22:00.649 --> 22:03.268
and there's oropharyngeal swelling.

22:03.269 --> 22:05.412
Is a big word supposed to scare me?

22:05.413 --> 22:06.860
Whatever gets your attention.

22:06.861 --> 22:08.796
It means mouth and throat.
How's your appetite?

22:08.797 --> 22:10.197
Voracious.

22:10.198 --> 22:11.585
Is that big word supposed to distract me

22:11.586 --> 22:15.312
from noticing your lunch
sitting over there untouched?

22:15.313 --> 22:17.764
I play better on an empty stomach.

22:17.765 --> 22:18.827
You ever try hitting a high note

22:18.828 --> 22:20.620
with a turkey sandwich in your belly?

22:20.621 --> 22:22.369
I'll eat when we finish this track.

22:22.370 --> 22:23.521
Fair enough.

22:23.522 --> 22:25.659
I'm gonna start you on some antibiotics.

22:25.660 --> 22:27.177
Awesome!

22:27.178 --> 22:28.872
I'm glad you're on board. Wow.

22:28.873 --> 22:32.532
- Paige!
- Ah, how cute is your hair!

22:32.533 --> 22:34.259
Answer, so cute!

22:34.260 --> 22:35.639
I cut it before the summer.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.247
- There's this boy...
- Oh.

22:37.248 --> 22:38.613
- I'll fill you in later.
- Okay.

22:38.614 --> 22:41.550
I guess the feud doesn't extend
to the next generation.

22:41.551 --> 22:42.878
- She used to babysit.
- Oh.

22:42.879 --> 22:44.335
Natty, this is Evan.

22:44.336 --> 22:45.338
How you doing? Nice to meet you.

22:45.339 --> 22:48.086
Hi. How cute is your boyfriend!

22:48.087 --> 22:50.620
- Answer, so cute!
- Right?

22:50.621 --> 22:53.500
Hey, guys, let's take it from the top.

22:53.501 --> 22:55.198
I want you guys to hear this.

22:55.199 --> 22:56.586
You know what, actually,

22:56.587 --> 22:59.650
um, we kind of already have heard it,

22:59.651 --> 23:01.944
- like, for the last hour.
- Too loud?

23:01.945 --> 23:04.963
Sorry, I was trying
to work out the bass line.

23:04.964 --> 23:06.345
Hey, I'm not done with you.

23:06.346 --> 23:08.755
Hey, guys, we gotta dial down the volume.

23:08.756 --> 23:10.201
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

23:10.202 --> 23:13.046
The most polite feud ever.

23:18.962 --> 23:22.075
You can play louder than that, if you want,

23:22.076 --> 23:23.460
we blew a fuse again.

23:23.461 --> 23:26.231
Dad, I thought the generator
was supposed to fix that.

23:26.232 --> 23:28.539
Yeah, so did I. Let me check it out.

23:41.632 --> 23:43.379
Any chance of foul play, captain?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.539
This structure's been the source
of a long-running feud.

23:45.540 --> 23:47.166
At present, it looks
like a generator ignited

23:47.167 --> 23:50.094
some fuel oil being stored inside.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.251
There's no sign
of any airborne toxins, doctor.

23:52.252 --> 23:53.994
Thanks for letting me know.
I appreciate it.

23:55.450 --> 23:58.957
I'm glad to see everyone's okay.

23:58.958 --> 24:00.710
Probably happy, even.

24:00.711 --> 24:04.220
Yes, we love having explosions
near our home.

24:04.221 --> 24:05.236
I hope you're not saying you think

24:05.237 --> 24:06.772
we had something to do with this.

24:06.773 --> 24:08.322
Okay, whoa. Everyone just calm down.

24:08.323 --> 24:11.258
- Daddy, I know you're angry.
- I am not angry.

24:11.259 --> 24:12.488
At least I wasn't.

24:12.588 --> 24:17.527
Guys, it seemed to me...
it lived its life.

24:18.461 --> 24:21.128
Like a candle house in the wind.

24:26.688 --> 24:28.572
Well, I thought it was beautiful.

24:28.573 --> 24:32.668
Thank you. So you don't think
your dad had anything to do you

24:32.669 --> 24:34.227
with the explosion, right?

24:34.228 --> 24:36.674
Are you kidding me?
He loved that candle house.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.345
Okay, good.

24:38.346 --> 24:41.767
- I should get him a bourbon.
- Right. Of course.

24:41.768 --> 24:43.688
Excuse me. Don Lobell, Dan's papers.

24:43.689 --> 24:46.192
You're Evan Lawson,
Paige Collins' boyfriend, right?

24:46.193 --> 24:49.307
Yeah, actually, Evan r. Lawson,

24:49.308 --> 24:50.666
the CFO of HankMed.

24:50.667 --> 24:52.676
Terrific. Can you confirm
that general Norman Schwarzkopf

24:52.677 --> 24:53.884
was here earlier?

24:53.885 --> 24:55.358
General Sch...

24:55.359 --> 24:57.682
- Uh, no comment.
- What about the rumors

24:57.683 --> 24:59.904
that general Collins is seeking office?

24:59.905 --> 25:02.406
- No comment.
- Is it congress?

25:02.407 --> 25:04.264
Governor? Bigger?

25:04.265 --> 25:07.014
Look, Don...

25:07.635 --> 25:09.377
The general is a man of the troops.

25:09.378 --> 25:11.013
He's not a politician.

25:11.014 --> 25:13.930
The only way he'll run...
and I mean the only way...

25:13.931 --> 25:16.849
is if the people draft him.
You know?

25:16.850 --> 25:18.835
Because he could never say no
to the people.

25:20.841 --> 25:22.603
But again, though, no comment.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.043
I know that it sounds a little crazy.

25:32.044 --> 25:33.083
A little?

25:33.084 --> 25:35.657
And obviously, the odds against
my being a match

25:35.658 --> 25:37.386
are astronomical.

25:37.387 --> 25:40.455
But since no one in Adam's family
matched Tali,

25:40.456 --> 25:42.222
I mean, they wouldn't match him either,
so...

25:42.223 --> 25:43.313
Divya...

25:43.314 --> 25:46.041
You don't even know if Adam needs a kidney.

25:46.042 --> 25:48.394
Exactly. So why not get tested,

25:48.395 --> 25:51.020
and see if the antigens line up?

25:51.021 --> 25:52.461
Because he's your patient.

25:52.462 --> 25:54.274
Because you're getting married.

25:54.275 --> 25:56.244
Because it's unnecessary.

25:56.245 --> 25:57.679
Do you want me to keep going?

25:57.680 --> 25:59.080
But...

25:59.081 --> 26:02.354
Let's say that we do match.

26:02.355 --> 26:05.632
Then it would explain our connection.

26:05.633 --> 26:07.101
I mean, I could be like the universe

26:07.102 --> 26:09.081
telling me something.

26:09.082 --> 26:11.433
That's asking a lot of the universe.

26:12.837 --> 26:14.790
If you want to break your engagement,

26:14.791 --> 26:17.351
then break it.

26:20.603 --> 26:25.053
That is not what I meant... at all.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.903
Sorry to have bothered you at work.

26:33.662 --> 26:36.338
My nephrologist, he scheduled a re-draw.

26:36.339 --> 26:37.437
He said not to worry.

26:37.438 --> 26:40.300
But after two HankMed visits in one day,

26:40.301 --> 26:41.565
maybe I should start.

26:41.566 --> 26:43.555
I'm not here to second-guess
your nephrologist,

26:43.556 --> 26:44.591
believe me.

26:44.592 --> 26:45.841
But the numbers weren't great,

26:45.842 --> 26:47.909
and I was in the neighborhood, so...

26:47.910 --> 26:51.204
You know what happened
between me and Divya, don't you?

26:51.205 --> 26:54.938
Yeah, I do. Breathe in for me, please.

26:58.205 --> 26:59.667
One more time.

27:01.315 --> 27:04.158
Well, no pericardial or pleuritic friction.

27:04.159 --> 27:04.864
That's good.

27:04.865 --> 27:06.187
So you think there's any hope?

27:07.939 --> 27:10.363
Well, I don't see any ecchymosis
or edema, so...

27:10.364 --> 27:12.772
I meant with Divya.

27:13.476 --> 27:15.478
I know.

27:16.451 --> 27:19.252
The good news is you seem pretty healthy.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.315
When do you, uh, see your nephrologist?

27:22.316 --> 27:24.090
Tomorrow afternoon.

27:26.341 --> 27:29.729
Adam, do you work out a lot?

27:30.412 --> 27:33.110
Man, what is it with you HankMed people?

27:33.111 --> 27:34.718
I'm like catnip to you.

27:34.719 --> 27:36.962
No, no, no, it's not that.

27:36.963 --> 27:39.056
When you have glomerulonephritis,

27:39.057 --> 27:42.267
strenuous exercise can generate a rise

27:42.268 --> 27:43.827
in proteins in the urine.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.375
I've been lifting and running.

27:46.376 --> 27:49.648
Okay. Well, take a break for a few days,

27:49.649 --> 27:52.355
and I'll bet your numbers
will return to normal.

27:52.356 --> 27:53.604
I will. Thanks.

27:54.404 --> 27:56.381
- What a relief.
- Yeah.

27:56.382 --> 27:57.741
All right. So long.

27:57.742 --> 28:00.139
- Hey, Hank.
- Yeah?

28:03.278 --> 28:05.873
I really do care about Divya.

28:05.874 --> 28:08.626
And I didn't mean to complicate things.

28:10.362 --> 28:12.757
I just want to do what's best for her.

28:12.758 --> 28:15.215
Then that's what you should do.

28:25.014 --> 28:27.827
"Itigbs," huh?

28:27.828 --> 28:29.072
That was a text to remember.

28:29.073 --> 28:30.386
You figure it out?

28:31.411 --> 28:34.065
"I think I'm gonna be sick."

28:34.066 --> 28:36.933
- A-plus, doctor.
- Thank you.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.107
Here's your prize.

28:40.108 --> 28:41.418
Hey, go get it.

28:42.341 --> 28:43.513
What's this?

28:43.514 --> 28:45.460
Some of the music I'm into.

28:45.461 --> 28:47.189
Check out the arcade fire track.

28:47.190 --> 28:49.782
- It's pretty killer.
- Nice. Thank you.

28:49.783 --> 28:54.558
But uh, "iwtkwgo."

28:54.559 --> 28:56.524
"I want to know what's going on."

28:56.525 --> 28:59.184
Well, my stomach's worse.

28:59.185 --> 29:01.374
And not just because of that joke.

29:01.375 --> 29:04.865
And my stool... there, I said it...

29:04.866 --> 29:06.646
has gotten dark.

29:06.647 --> 29:08.361
Eww, this is a gross conversation.

29:08.362 --> 29:09.699
It's about to get grosser.

29:09.700 --> 29:10.808
Did you notice any blood?

29:13.465 --> 29:14.506
Go on, guy.

29:14.507 --> 29:17.185
Take that drool-covered thing
back to your house.

29:17.186 --> 29:19.409
What... what is that?

29:19.410 --> 29:20.988
Deer hide, I think.

29:20.989 --> 29:23.676
The general liked to shoot unarmed animals.

29:25.227 --> 29:28.497
Natalie, would you show me your hands?

29:30.422 --> 29:32.501
These black spots, do they hurt?

29:32.502 --> 29:35.106
No. They just appear.

29:35.107 --> 29:38.450
Why? What are they?

29:38.451 --> 29:39.338
Don't tell me this is one of those

29:39.339 --> 29:41.654
life-endangering exceptions
you talked about.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.263
I don't think so, but you may
have been infected

29:43.264 --> 29:44.784
by a bacterium.

29:44.785 --> 29:46.864
Bacillus anthracis.

29:46.865 --> 29:47.881
I'm using the big words

29:47.882 --> 29:49.753
because I don't want you
to be scared by the small one.

29:49.754 --> 29:53.875
- What's the word?
- Anthrax.

29:53.876 --> 29:55.852
Where would I have gotten that?

29:55.853 --> 29:58.292
I'm sorry for your loss, sir.

29:58.293 --> 30:01.104
I know that candle house
was like a son to you.

30:04.615 --> 30:06.824
Honey, would you turn that thing off?

30:06.825 --> 30:08.201
I'm in no mood.

30:13.168 --> 30:16.067
Daddy, what is that?

30:16.068 --> 30:17.367
Nothing.

30:17.368 --> 30:19.475
Too many cigars.

30:19.476 --> 30:22.308
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

30:22.309 --> 30:25.693
That was weird... medically speaking.

30:25.694 --> 30:27.718
Is something wrong with my dad?

30:27.719 --> 30:29.828
I'll get Hank.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.699
Animals can get anthrax by ingesting soil

30:38.700 --> 30:40.470
containing the bacterium.

30:40.471 --> 30:43.129
People get it in their skin
by handling infected hides,

30:43.130 --> 30:46.583
or, if spores are airborne
in their intestines and lungs.

30:46.584 --> 30:48.809
So basically, the general's
backwoods hobby

30:48.810 --> 30:50.119
endangered our daughter's life.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.569
I'm not dying. Listen to Hank.

30:52.570 --> 30:54.072
Again, this is a hunch.

30:54.073 --> 30:57.239
The good news is your daughter's already
on antibiotics,

30:57.240 --> 30:59.102
and her symptoms suggest
we caught this early.

30:59.103 --> 31:00.605
Are Patton and MacArthur sick?

31:00.606 --> 31:03.039
Possibly, but the dogs look healthy,

31:03.040 --> 31:04.072
which is a good sign.

31:04.073 --> 31:04.885
I've called Hamptons heritage.

31:04.886 --> 31:06.250
They'll run the cultures I sent,

31:06.251 --> 31:07.762
and then we'll know for sure.

31:07.763 --> 31:09.267
What about Natty's band members

31:09.268 --> 31:10.607
and the rest of our household?

31:10.608 --> 31:13.195
Well, the hospital will offer
prophylactic cipro to all of you.

31:13.196 --> 31:14.879
But no one else touched the hide,

31:14.880 --> 31:16.512
so there's no cause for alarm.

31:16.513 --> 31:18.181
Pack up. We'll drive to the hospital

31:18.182 --> 31:19.292
after I stop next door.

31:19.293 --> 31:20.106
Hey, I'm coming with you.

31:20.107 --> 31:21.938
I have a few words I want
to say to the general.

31:21.939 --> 31:25.061
I'm sure you do, but stay with Natalie.

31:25.062 --> 31:26.569
She needs you right now.

31:30.344 --> 31:31.820
Why am I getting all these...

31:32.972 --> 31:34.777
What?

31:34.778 --> 31:36.532
What's up?

31:36.533 --> 31:38.746
"Go 4 it, general."

31:38.747 --> 31:40.905
Suddenly, all my contacts want my dad to...

31:40.906 --> 31:45.394
"Draft Collins for senate"?

31:45.395 --> 31:48.106
How in the world would they have...

31:48.107 --> 31:49.503
Evan...

31:53.145 --> 31:54.854
I still can't believe it.

31:54.855 --> 31:56.843
I dressed those kills myself.

31:56.844 --> 31:58.355
Those animals were healthy.

31:58.356 --> 32:00.963
Yeah, or they just looked healthy.

32:00.964 --> 32:04.318
If something I did made
that little girl sick,

32:04.319 --> 32:06.455
is... is there anything I can do?

32:06.456 --> 32:07.950
Let me examine you.

32:07.951 --> 32:09.261
You're coughing, and I can see

32:09.262 --> 32:10.615
you're having trouble swallowing.

32:10.616 --> 32:13.704
Well, like I told Paige,
it's my allergies.

32:13.705 --> 32:15.715
All do respect, sir, you said

32:15.716 --> 32:17.601
it was all the cigars you were smoking.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.635
Daddy, let Hank examine you.

32:23.719 --> 32:26.302
Open your mouth, please.

32:26.303 --> 32:26.865
Say ahh.

32:26.866 --> 32:29.228
- Ahh.
- Okay.

32:29.229 --> 32:31.685
I can tell you it's not anthrax.

32:31.686 --> 32:33.391
You're right.

32:33.392 --> 32:37.180
Anthrax doesn't present
with singed nasal hairs.

32:37.181 --> 32:39.821
Looks like you were close to a fire.

32:39.822 --> 32:43.048
Or an explosion.

32:46.089 --> 32:50.600
I just wanted to shut that music.

32:50.601 --> 32:54.090
But I never wanted to do it this way.

32:54.091 --> 32:57.991
Some old lamp oil got spilled.

32:57.992 --> 33:00.171
I tried to mop it up, but...

33:00.172 --> 33:04.445
Then one accident led to another.

33:19.850 --> 33:23.164
After all the fighting
to save that damn place,

33:23.165 --> 33:24.656
I blew it up myself.

33:36.023 --> 33:38.747
Yeah... yeah, I don't like this.

33:38.748 --> 33:43.003
I'm seeing tracheal burns and swelling.

33:43.004 --> 33:44.480
Okay, I'm pulling it out now.

33:45.282 --> 33:46.681
Ev, call 911.

33:46.682 --> 33:49.063
Tell them it's a chemical burn
and endangered airway.

33:49.064 --> 33:50.795
Now. Thank you.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.160
Paige, hold this for me, please.

33:52.161 --> 33:55.170
- Oh, for Pete's sake!
- No talking.

33:55.171 --> 33:57.155
With the condition
of your trachea, I just...

33:57.156 --> 33:58.929
I want to avoid an intubation in the field.

33:58.930 --> 33:59.885
Intubation?

33:59.886 --> 34:01.902
Yeah. They're on their way. Yeah.

34:01.903 --> 34:03.708
Okay, steady breaths. Stay calm.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.528
How can I with all that racket?

34:05.529 --> 34:07.368
It's just some drums. Ignore it.

34:08.455 --> 34:10.898
No, let's not.

34:10.899 --> 34:12.646
Evan, Paige, monitor his breathing.

34:12.647 --> 34:13.672
I'll be right back, okay?

34:13.672 --> 34:14.750
If you hear any wetness or crackling,

34:14.751 --> 34:16.208
- yell for me.
- You got it.

34:29.362 --> 34:31.065
Don't touch these drums.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.025
The drums are made from animal hides.

34:36.027 --> 34:38.271
And since their drummer
also has some necrotic spots

34:38.272 --> 34:39.291
starting on his hands...

34:39.292 --> 34:40.516
- I think you found the source.
- Mm-hmm.

34:40.516 --> 34:42.661
And another reason not to date drummers.

34:42.661 --> 34:43.846
The way this girl plays,

34:43.847 --> 34:45.958
plenty of spores probably
landed on her food.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.829
We were so quick to blame
general Collins.

34:48.830 --> 34:50.121
He blew up my shed.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.311
Dad, you wanted it demolished.

34:53.166 --> 34:54.493
Still.

34:54.494 --> 34:56.226
Paige. Paige!

34:59.040 --> 35:01.367
Let her go first.

35:16.055 --> 35:18.983
Look, I am so sorry for being cagey,

35:18.984 --> 35:21.472
but it thought that if I told you

35:21.473 --> 35:23.397
that this was a peace summit,

35:23.398 --> 35:25.212
neither one of you would have shown up.

35:25.213 --> 35:27.819
This isn't necessary, Mr. Lawson.

35:27.820 --> 35:28.804
That's something we can agree on.

35:28.805 --> 35:31.268
You know, you are both great doctors.

35:31.269 --> 35:34.951
And any sign to the contrary, my fault.

35:34.952 --> 35:37.951
You know, my lawyers suggested

35:37.952 --> 35:41.819
that poor health might
have a positive effect

35:41.820 --> 35:43.367
on my sentencing.

35:43.368 --> 35:47.355
He also suggested
that the courts do not look kindly

35:47.356 --> 35:49.455
on medical records that are generated

35:49.456 --> 35:51.760
by family members.

35:51.761 --> 35:53.893
Okay, dad, what's your point?

35:53.894 --> 35:56.563
Well, I feel bad. I want to help.

35:56.564 --> 36:01.319
So I know that you
and Dr. Peck are...friends.

36:01.320 --> 36:05.340
So I persuaded her
to help me try and find a way

36:05.341 --> 36:07.917
to stay out of prison
and spend time with my boys.

36:07.918 --> 36:10.436
Look, I would like that too, dad...
Really, I would.

36:10.437 --> 36:12.630
- But you can't ask...
- Don't be mad at her.

36:12.631 --> 36:14.522
- What... I'm...
- Or me.

36:14.523 --> 36:16.929
We were just following legal advice.

36:16.930 --> 36:20.440
If there's any fault here,
it's with the lawyers.

36:20.441 --> 36:21.829
Lawyers...

36:21.830 --> 36:23.938
You know what Shakespeare said.

36:23.939 --> 36:26.983
"Kill 'em all. Let God sort it out."

36:26.984 --> 36:28.373
Okay.

36:28.374 --> 36:30.344
He's not a big reader.

36:30.345 --> 36:33.608
I think your father believes
that actually helped.

36:33.609 --> 36:35.477
He is an optimist.

36:35.478 --> 36:36.663
What about you?

36:36.664 --> 36:38.394
Me, I'm not sure.

36:39.914 --> 36:42.563
Look, if I accused you of something
you didn't do,

36:42.564 --> 36:44.360
I apologize.

36:45.247 --> 36:46.990
But I guess I don't know
what's over the line for you

36:46.991 --> 36:48.955
because after all this,

36:48.956 --> 36:51.494
I feel like I barely know you.

36:51.495 --> 36:54.302
Like that thing you said
about not having a father who cared.

36:54.303 --> 36:56.603
What is that? What happened?

36:56.604 --> 36:58.324
You don't want to know.

36:58.325 --> 37:00.811
Well, I do want to know.

37:01.657 --> 37:03.556
Well, it's not gonna happen.

37:03.557 --> 37:05.145
I don't go there, and I certainly

37:05.146 --> 37:06.775
don't take anybody else.

37:06.776 --> 37:08.506
Emily...

37:08.507 --> 37:10.108
No, seriously.

37:10.109 --> 37:13.386
Don't think you just need
to put in more time.

37:13.387 --> 37:15.773
This is me. This is what you get.

37:16.815 --> 37:19.163
There's more to you than this.

37:19.164 --> 37:20.436
I told you from the start, Hank...

37:20.437 --> 37:22.235
I know. And now I'm telling you

37:22.236 --> 37:24.685
it's not enough for me.

37:24.686 --> 37:27.010
If this is all we're gonna be,

37:28.364 --> 37:29.885
it's not what I want.

37:29.886 --> 37:31.953
I'm sorry.

37:42.523 --> 37:44.321
For the record, Hank,

37:44.322 --> 37:46.644
you got closer than anyone else.

38:02.869 --> 38:05.500
So... Did I help?

38:07.022 --> 38:10.412
You know what, dad, maybe you did.

38:27.117 --> 38:28.707
Long day?

38:28.708 --> 38:30.763
You're still here.

38:31.858 --> 38:33.597
I am.

38:33.598 --> 38:35.131
How are your patients?

38:35.132 --> 38:38.283
Uh, the general's oxygenating better.

38:38.284 --> 38:40.821
Natalie's fighting off the infection.

38:40.822 --> 38:42.519
She and her drummer
were already working on new riffs

38:42.520 --> 38:45.550
in the E.R... She is awesome.

38:45.551 --> 38:48.205
Oh, one piece of bad news.

38:48.206 --> 38:51.371
We will have to resume
the search for your replacement.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.526
Dr. peck isn't interested?

38:54.592 --> 38:56.867
We broke up.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.657
I had to end it.

38:59.247 --> 39:02.187
I thought I ended things with Adam.

39:02.188 --> 39:04.663
But then...

39:05.868 --> 39:08.953
I didn't intend to mislead you.

39:08.954 --> 39:10.094
Ehh...

39:13.927 --> 39:15.590
Ahh...

39:16.282 --> 39:18.696
Why is it that people
who are wrong for us

39:18.697 --> 39:21.918
seem more exciting than
those who are right?

39:21.919 --> 39:23.390
Is Adam wrong,

39:23.391 --> 39:25.328
or is he just new?

39:25.329 --> 39:27.934
You know, the excitement
and thrill of the unknown,

39:27.935 --> 39:31.004
where it's all about potential
and what could be.

39:31.005 --> 39:33.591
Sometimes that's deceptive.

39:33.592 --> 39:36.654
You know, until it's not.

39:36.655 --> 39:38.552
The last time Raj was new to me,

39:38.553 --> 39:39.808
we were both in diapers.

39:42.068 --> 39:45.568
Ah, but is it that simple,
that Raj is known

39:45.569 --> 39:47.905
and Adam is new?

39:47.906 --> 39:50.792
It's a working hypothesis.

39:52.552 --> 39:54.444
How come you and I are so good

39:54.445 --> 39:55.729
at diagnosing other people,

39:55.730 --> 39:58.786
and so lousy at figuring out
our own problems?

39:58.787 --> 40:01.816
Maybe because it's harder to see inside.

40:01.817 --> 40:04.854
We do have a portable X-ray.

40:04.855 --> 40:06.938
If only it were that simple.

40:12.019 --> 40:15.178
And from this site,
a warning lantern was flashed,

40:15.179 --> 40:17.454
telling the American troops to retreat.

40:17.455 --> 40:19.377
Son, I'd like a word with you.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.264
Um, yeah, whatever it is,
it wasn't my fault,

40:21.265 --> 40:22.856
because I just got here, sir...

40:22.857 --> 40:25.567
All this public attention,
not really my style.

40:25.568 --> 40:27.002
It never would have happened
if you hadn't opened

40:27.003 --> 40:28.709
your big yap.

40:28.710 --> 40:30.213
Yeah.

40:30.214 --> 40:33.081
I'm sorry. Paige told you?

40:33.082 --> 40:35.817
No. You just did.

40:35.818 --> 40:37.646
Oh, that...

40:37.647 --> 40:39.461
Wow, you're pretty good.

40:39.462 --> 40:40.890
If left to my own devices,

40:40.891 --> 40:44.095
I might never have tested
the political waters.

40:44.096 --> 40:48.838
But apparently... people like me.

40:48.839 --> 40:53.030
So I guess your gaff
was the shot in the ass I needed.

40:53.031 --> 40:55.125
I guess that makes us even, then.

41:00.272 --> 41:03.259
So how goes the album?

41:03.260 --> 41:06.054
Almost done, Hank, thanks to you.

41:06.055 --> 41:09.026
Ah, please. You're the one
with the talent.

41:09.027 --> 41:11.765
- I just got you healthy.
- That's a talent.

41:11.766 --> 41:13.169
Yeah.

41:13.170 --> 41:16.289
You know, for an old guy who's a doctor,

41:16.290 --> 41:17.993
you're pretty cool.

41:17.994 --> 41:20.823
Thank you. You're pretty cool too.

41:22.996 --> 41:24.749
Go get 'em, kid.

41:31.098 --> 41:32.974
I sorry.

41:32.975 --> 41:34.984
I happy.

41:52.674 --> 41:54.863
Tali. Hi.

41:54.864 --> 41:56.494
Hi.

41:56.495 --> 41:59.428
Is Adam here?

41:59.429 --> 42:00.956
Oh, he left last night.

42:00.957 --> 42:03.521
He's filming in Peru for a few months.

42:03.522 --> 42:05.782
Can I give him a message?

42:05.783 --> 42:07.590
No.

42:07.591 --> 42:11.824
No, uh, I have his number.

42:11.825 --> 42:14.356
All right.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.632
You don't have anything to stop her

42:32.633 --> 42:34.083
from growing up, do you, Hank?

42:34.084 --> 42:36.906
No. Unfortunately, I do not.

42:36.907 --> 42:40.199
But I think she's doing just fine.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.991
You don't have to worry so much.

42:41.992 --> 42:44.344
Are you saying we set
too many boundaries?

42:44.345 --> 42:46.974
You are her parents. Isn't that your job?
