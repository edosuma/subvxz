you applied for

Foutley makes me sick

00:21.521 --> 00:22.480
It's me?

00:22.564 --> 00:23.982
I transferred you the money

00:24.065 --> 00:26.735
from my Bat-Mitzvah account

We all know

Ginger, I want
you to have

02:48.293 --> 02:49.586
this clever

02:49.669 --> 02:53.423
Thanks, Courtney.

It's... it's...

02:56.175 --> 02:58.553
It's Courtney.

We should have
done that.

Uh... thanks, but, uh...

03:02.849 --> 03:05.268
what am I going to
do with this thing?

03:05.351 --> 03:06.436
I'll take her.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.312
We really get along.

Oh, Courtney--
your top is all mussed.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.734

{\an1}Everyone, please

Good-bye, Ginger!

You're taking this
quite well, Darren.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.356
Yeah, Mr. Tough Guy.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.776
Look, you two, no one loves
Ginger more than me,

03:54.859 --> 03:56.569
but that's exactly
why I want what's best for her.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.528
{\an1}What?

03:56.653 --> 03:57.528
What?

03:57.612 --> 03:59.697
What?

03:59.781 --> 04:02.325
Did you even hear
what you just said?

04:02.408 --> 04:03.576
Yeah, about what?

04:03.660 --> 04:04.661
About Ginger!

04:04.744 --> 04:06.955
What'd I say?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.165
BOTH:
You said you love her!

04:09.248 --> 04:13.127
Uh, no, didn't mean it
the way it sounded.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.464
I'm going outside for air.

04:18.507 --> 04:24.180
If you didn't mean it the way it
sounded, then what did you mean?

04:25.765 --> 04:29.227
I call him "Mr. Hoodsdonowitz."

04:29.310 --> 04:31.312
Huh... sounds Jewish.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.647
He could be.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.565
He looks old to me,
which matters,

04:34.649 --> 04:36.818
because without him, we can
kiss the Freak fame good-bye.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.487
Come on, let's make it happen.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.699
{\an1}Patience, my dove,
is a virtue,

04:42.782 --> 04:45.076
for, you see, before
he can walk the walk,

04:45.159 --> 04:48.871
{\an1}Hoodsdonowitz must first
talk the talk.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.373
You mean, like, an accent?

04:50.456 --> 04:54.293
{\an5}I mean you must
first be Hoodsdonowitz
on the inside.

04:54.377 --> 04:58.798
But Noelle, I'm not
Hoodsdonowitz on the inside.

04:58.881 --> 05:02.093
I'm just, like, water
and organs and stuff.

05:02.176 --> 05:02.885
Give it a try, Hoods.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.804

like a grownup.

Hello, children.

Huh.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.021
That didn't
really feel

05:13.104 --> 05:15.189
all that manly,
if you ask me.

05:15.273 --> 05:15.606
No.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.859
{\an1}Well, duh!

05:17.942 --> 05:19.152
{\an1}How am I supposed
to feel manly?

05:19.235 --> 05:21.571
{\an1}I'm not manly--
isn't it obvious?

05:21.654 --> 05:25.074
I know.

What are you doing?

05:26.325 --> 05:27.869
Nothing.

{\an1}Carl,
what's she up to?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.372
I don't know.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.852
I don't.

{\an1}If you need me...
for anything,

05:54.896 --> 05:57.774
{\an5}I can be up there
in a matter of hours,
so just call me.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.401
I will, Mom.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.779
But I won't.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.288
I love you, Sweetie.

brother was awake,
he'd say the same.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.306
You won't be
seeing her today.

10:40.389 --> 10:41.974
Oh, Ginger, Ginger!

10:42.058 --> 10:43.351
I remember when she
offered to loan me

10:43.434 --> 10:45.686
the hair scrunchy
right off her own head

10:45.770 --> 10:49.857
{\an5}because my hair
was flying all over
the place during gym.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.902
{\an1}Yeah, and you said,
"Ew, no way."

10:52.985 --> 10:54.362
That's right, I did.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.696
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Oh, Ginger.

10:57.531 --> 10:58.866
This is
ridiculous.

10:58.949 --> 11:01.994
{\an5}She's acting
like Ginger was
her best friend.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.455
{\an1}At least this
nauseating little display

11:04.538 --> 11:07.249
{\an1}will come in handy
for phase two.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.585
Group hug, girls, group hug.

11:09.668 --> 11:13.422
Let me try to soak up
every last bit of Ginger

11:13.506 --> 11:15.216
that might still be on you.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.592
(<i> shutter clicks</i> )

11:16.675 --> 11:17.593
I call this one:

11:17.676 --> 11:20.262
"Your Best Friends
Have Moved On,

11:20.346 --> 11:21.097
So Why Don't You?"

11:21.180 --> 11:24.517
(<i> cackles</i> )

11:24.600 --> 11:25.893
(<i> cackling echoes</i> )

11:31.690 --> 11:34.360
{\an1}Hey, roommie--
over here.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.782
THEA:
Guys, this is Ginger, she's...

11:39.865 --> 11:40.324
Embarrassed, right?

11:40.408 --> 11:42.201
Not until
right now.

11:42.284 --> 11:42.785
Thanks, Fred.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.453
(<i> group chuckling</i> )

11:44.537 --> 11:47.665
She's a new
fellowship transplant,

11:47.748 --> 11:49.417
so don't get too attached.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.128
It might be hard.

11:52.211 --> 11:52.962
{\an1}First time away
from home?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.922
Pretty much.

11:55.005 --> 11:55.923
Are you homesick?

11:56.006 --> 11:59.427
Surprisingly, no.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.139
{\an1}Well, what are
you sore at me for?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.516
I didn't kiss <i> her.</i>

12:05.599 --> 12:08.602
{\an5}And it's not like
she's your official
girlfriend, Carl.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.645
You said that.

12:09.728 --> 12:10.521
Not the point.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.481
Look, Noelle
was just trying

12:12.565 --> 12:14.316
to help me get
my swerve on

12:14.400 --> 12:14.984
and it worked.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.194
My Hutzdonowitz
is flawless,

12:17.278 --> 12:18.154
and that means
the three of us

12:18.237 --> 12:19.488
are that much closer

12:19.572 --> 12:21.365
to the Weird
Human Winter Fest.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.660
{\an1}That's what
you want, isn't it?

12:24.743 --> 12:26.036
Well, isn't it?

12:28.956 --> 12:31.125
{\an5}Maybe I should
start off the
conversation.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.377
{\an5}You know, just
so she doesn't
think that...

12:33.461 --> 12:35.754
Greetings, Mr. Hutzdonowitz.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.256
(<i> clears throat</i> )

12:37.339 --> 12:40.468
{\an4}(<i> in deep voice</i> ):
My closest friends
call me Hoodsey.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.552
{\an3}Hoodsey.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.512
{\an1}Oh, uh, yeah,
Carl had something

12:43.596 --> 12:45.139
{\an1}he wanted to, uh,
conversate with you about.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.140
Uh, Carl.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.184
It was nothing.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.478
Come on, Carl, don't be shy.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.605
It's just that, well,

12:52.688 --> 12:55.316
{\an1}cheesecake pudding
sounds kind of icky,

12:55.399 --> 12:58.777
{\an1}but, um,
it actually isn't.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.244
(<i> phone dialing</i> )

13:07.328 --> 13:08.078
Hello, Mipsy.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.247
What's up, Cuz?

13:10.331 --> 13:11.874
Calling with
the progress report.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.376
Phase two of Operation
Transfer Girl is going great.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.711
Ginger loves it here

13:15.794 --> 13:19.757
and I am doing a great job
of helping her to fit in.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.008
Chi-ching.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.760
So if you can work
your magic on Uncle Maurice

13:22.843 --> 13:25.721
and get him to cough up
a scholarship,

13:25.804 --> 13:28.057
I think Foutley
might actually accept.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.059
The only thing is,
I get the feeling

13:30.142 --> 13:32.603
she's missing her dorky
little friends from back home.

13:32.686 --> 13:36.190
Don't worry,
when Foutley gets our mailing,

13:36.273 --> 13:38.359
she'll realize that
absolutely everyone

13:38.442 --> 13:42.196
is happier with her
out of the picture.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.662
(<i> Hoodsey giggling</i> )

13:49.745 --> 13:50.079
It tickles.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.373
Hold still.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.542
{\an5}CARL:
It's like he stole
all my confidence

13:54.625 --> 13:58.420
and she's giving him
all the attention

13:58.504 --> 14:00.589
and I'm the third wheel.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.467
Perfection.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.553
Say, Carl,
can you grab

14:05.636 --> 14:07.096
the drywall stilts
for me?

14:07.179 --> 14:09.265
I want to take one
more practice run.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.558
You guys aren't...

14:10.641 --> 14:12.059
Thanks,
little buddy.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.936
(<i> angrily</i> ):
"Little buddy"?!

14:20.734 --> 14:23.862
(<i> in deep voice</i> ):
Hello, children.

14:25.322 --> 14:28.492
Wow! He's a man.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.620
He's a man.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.372
(<i> Hoodsey giggling</i> )

14:33.455 --> 14:35.291
{\an5}HOODSEY:
We are <i> so</i> going
to that freak fest.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.252
Ain't it grand,
Carl?

14:38.335 --> 14:39.712
Carl?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.175
Will you give her
the message that we called?

14:45.259 --> 14:46.302
Thanks.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.305
She's not there.

14:49.388 --> 14:50.848
{\an3}Rats.

14:50.931 --> 14:51.724
{\an1}Very well.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.517
{\an1}Let's just carry on
as planned.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.144
{\an1}Now, what
would Ginger do

14:55.227 --> 14:56.312
if she were here?

14:56.395 --> 14:58.480
She'd probably
stretch out on my bed

14:58.564 --> 14:59.231
and tell us a funny story

14:59.315 --> 15:02.651
or something.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.694
Uh-huh.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.821
What kind of funny story,
exactly?

15:05.904 --> 15:09.241
{\an5}Oh, you know,
something about
her brother

15:09.325 --> 15:11.243
or what happened
in the cafeteria

15:11.327 --> 15:12.494
or something like that.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.787
{\an3}I see.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.956
My brother, Blake,

15:16.040 --> 15:19.418
almost left the house
wearing tweed slacks today.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.879
Really! Then what happened?

15:21.962 --> 15:25.174
Mama said, "Oh, no!"

15:26.383 --> 15:28.302
Tweed, huh?

15:28.385 --> 15:30.179
{\an3}Oh...

15:30.262 --> 15:30.554
It's no use.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.431
I can't do it.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.349
I just want things
back to normal.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.476
I mean...

15:35.559 --> 15:37.686
You don't actually
wear these, do you?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.064
Let's try looking
on the bright side.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.106
After all,
if Ginger wasn't away,

15:41.190 --> 15:44.735
the three of us would
never have had this chance

15:44.818 --> 15:46.820
to get to know
each other.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.906
{\an3}Off me.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.909
{\an5}Look, it's not that
I don't find you girls
Gingerish-- I do--

15:51.992 --> 15:56.205
{\an5}and while doing
these ridiculous
little sleepovers

15:56.288 --> 15:57.539
and nightly
phone calls

15:57.623 --> 15:59.249
are certainly
Gingeresque,

15:59.333 --> 16:02.086
it's... it's a far cry
from the real deal.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.880
The truth is, you're not Ginger.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.840
Neither of you.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.843
But I wish you were.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.897
What's going on with me, Ginge?

16:21.980 --> 16:25.651
It's like I can't stop
thinking about you.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.364
(<i> knocking</i> )

16:30.447 --> 16:30.906
Uh, come in.

16:30.989 --> 16:34.576
{\an1}Uh, Son,
everything okay?

16:34.660 --> 16:35.994
Uh, sure, Dad.

16:39.665 --> 16:40.874
We were, uh, just
walking by your room

16:40.958 --> 16:43.377
so we thought we'd see
if you wanted to talk.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.629
About what?

16:45.713 --> 16:47.089
Well, uh, she and I,

16:47.172 --> 16:48.799
we just, uh,
couldn't help but, uh...

16:48.882 --> 16:51.760
{\an5}You haven't been
yourself lately, sweetie.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.264
Not eating much,
not talking much.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.432
{\an1}I hear you
in your room

16:56.515 --> 16:57.766
at all hours
of the night,

16:57.850 --> 16:59.768
{\an1}so I know you're
not sleeping much.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.062
Yeah, I know.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.605
It's the weirdest thing,

17:03.689 --> 17:06.858
but ever since Ginger left,
nothing's the same.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.777
I'm not interested in anything

17:08.861 --> 17:11.238
and I can't stop
thinking about her.

17:11.320 --> 17:14.700
{\an1}(<i> cheerfully relieved</i> ):
Is that all, Son?

17:14.782 --> 17:16.160
Oh, shucks!

17:16.242 --> 17:17.703
That's okay!

17:17.786 --> 17:19.288
You're just in love, is all.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.248
Oh, heck.

17:21.330 --> 17:24.917
If you love her, Son, just do
what I did with your mother.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.797
Throw her in a headlock
and give her a noogie?

17:28.881 --> 17:29.506
Sure enough worked for me.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.885
Let the boy alone.

17:32.968 --> 17:36.221
Honey, if you really think
you love her, then go tell her.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.598
Tell her,
because life moves along

17:37.681 --> 17:38.891
fast and furious.

17:38.974 --> 17:42.311
And if you don't
step up to bat,

17:42.394 --> 17:45.689
{\an1}you can be sure
that someone else will.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.492
Let me give you
a lift.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.576
{\an1}But it's
right there.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.495
It's right there

17:59.578 --> 18:01.663
if you're going
back to your dorm,

18:01.747 --> 18:04.416
but if you're not going
back to your dorm,

18:04.500 --> 18:05.626
it could be anywhere.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.169
How about
a little ride?

18:07.252 --> 18:08.462
I'll let you drive.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.799
It's getting late
and I was supposed to check in

18:11.882 --> 18:13.759
with my friends tonight
from back home.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.594
They got this far without you.

18:15.677 --> 18:16.929
They can tough it out.

18:17.012 --> 18:20.599
{\an1}Okay, but I'm not
driving this thing.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.643
I don't even know how.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.102
(<i> engine revs</i> )

18:26.772 --> 18:30.609
Oh, it's ginger chicken, see?

18:30.692 --> 18:31.735
Uh, look, Courtney,

18:31.819 --> 18:34.363
this whole
"woe is us" thing

18:34.446 --> 18:35.697
isn't really
working out.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.865
I mean,
you're hoping

18:36.949 --> 18:39.034
that <i> we</i> can fill
Ginger's shoes...

18:39.117 --> 18:41.495
{\an5}And we're hoping
that <i> you</i> can fill
Ginger's shoes.

18:41.578 --> 18:42.955
But the truth is

18:43.038 --> 18:47.042
{\an1}none of us can fill
Ginger's shoes, which are...

18:47.125 --> 18:48.877
Size 7½, I know.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.672
And what's worse is,
mourning Ginger's absence

18:51.755 --> 18:54.508
is really taking its toll
on my complexion.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.801
Look at these frown lines.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.178
I've gone through
an entire canister

18:58.262 --> 19:01.139
of dual-purpose wet-dry powder
in less than a week.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.225
I'm sure Mipsy
has some in her locker.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.353
They know each
other's combinations.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.480
Now, that's
friendship.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.026
COURTNEY:
"Operation Transfer Girl."

19:13.110 --> 19:14.862
GINGER:
<i>It's so weird.</i>

19:14.945 --> 19:18.198
<i>The longer I'm away from home,</i>
<i>the more at home I feel here.</i>

19:18.282 --> 19:21.827
<i>But at the same time,</i>
<i>it's really nagging at me</i>

19:21.910 --> 19:24.413
<i>that I haven't heard</i>
<i>from Dodie or Macie yet.</i>

19:24.496 --> 19:28.584
<i>But every time I try to</i>
<i>call them, something comes up,</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:33.589
<i>which kind of makes me wonder</i>
<i>if after all these years,</i>

19:33.672 --> 19:35.924
<i>maybe we're actually</i>
<i>growing apart</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:39.511
<i>and if maybe, like my mom said,</i>

19:39.595 --> 19:42.389
<i>that kind of change</i>
<i>is a good thing.</i>

19:43.682 --> 19:44.808
Thea, wait up!

19:44.892 --> 19:45.767
Well, well,

19:45.851 --> 19:47.603
you got in late last night.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.437
I was hanging out
with Fred.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.480
{\an1}Right on.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.607
He's a total catch.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.441
A guy like that

19:52.524 --> 19:54.693
{\an1}could make a girl
never want to go home,

19:54.776 --> 19:56.862
don't you think?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.489
{\an1}Oh, speaking of home,
you got a package.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.782
{\an1}I left it
on your bed.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.575
That's so funny.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.785
{\an5}I was thinking
about home
all morning.

20:03.869 --> 20:04.828
What were you thinking?

20:04.912 --> 20:06.413
Well, a lot
of things.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.123
But mainly
I was realizing

20:08.206 --> 20:09.708
that the big
difference

20:09.791 --> 20:12.669
between Avalanche Arts
and Lucky Junior High

20:12.753 --> 20:13.337
is that at Lucky,

20:13.420 --> 20:15.547
everyone just
wants to fit in,

20:15.631 --> 20:18.216
and here it's like
the more you stand out,

20:18.300 --> 20:19.593
the better.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.136
Ladies.

20:21.219 --> 20:23.847
Guess that's
kind of true.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.224
I think I'm ready
for a little change.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.225
{\an1}Cool.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.143
Want to help me?

20:28.226 --> 20:29.561
I do, actually,

20:29.645 --> 20:32.272
and I know just
where to start.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.815
{\an1}(<i> in distance</i> ):
Psst!

20:33.899 --> 20:35.359
Carl?

20:35.442 --> 20:37.861
{\an1}I'm inside
the cubbies.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.073
(<i> gasps</i> )

20:41.156 --> 20:43.575
Noelle, what are
you doing here?

20:43.659 --> 20:47.329
{\an1}Something has gone
terribly wrong with Carl.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.538
Can you feel it?

20:48.622 --> 20:51.375
Yeah, he's P-Oed.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.626
It's all my fault.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.045
I didn't want to be in
this stupid freak fest

20:55.128 --> 20:57.506
until I saw how much
it mattered to Carl,

20:57.589 --> 20:58.674
how much attention
he was giving me.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.842
I know, right.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.136
And then when
I kissed you

21:03.220 --> 21:05.180
and he got so jealous...

21:05.263 --> 21:05.847
I know, I know.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.850
{\an1}But the whole
thing backfired.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.269
I thought all this

21:10.352 --> 21:12.521
{\an1}would make him
like me even more,

21:12.604 --> 21:13.063
but instead...

21:13.146 --> 21:14.940
Aha! Just as I suspected.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.609
No, Carl, you don't understand!

21:17.693 --> 21:19.194
Oh, I understand perfectly.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.239
And don't worry, the two of you
won't have to sneak around

21:22.322 --> 21:22.948
to get away from me anymore.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.324
I'm finished with both of you

21:24.408 --> 21:28.036
and I'm not going
to the freak fest, either!

21:29.913 --> 21:33.875
On the one hand, opening it
is a total violation of privacy.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.168
But on the
other hand,

21:35.252 --> 21:36.878
{\an5}if they're up
to something
really rotten,

21:36.962 --> 21:39.172
they need
to be stopped.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.508
{\an1}Desperate times,
desperate measures.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.969
You do it--
French tips.

21:44.886 --> 21:45.971
(<i> gasps</i> )

21:46.054 --> 21:47.514
I knew it! I knew it!

21:47.597 --> 21:50.892
Ginger didn't get into
that school on her own.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.478
Miranda and Mipsy
were behind the whole thing.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.731
{\an1}What?!

21:55.814 --> 21:58.775
{\an5}This is a copy
of the letter Mipsy
wrote to her uncle.

21:58.859 --> 21:59.609
He's on the board.

21:59.693 --> 22:02.070
And here's a receipt
for a wire transfer.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.113
(<i> gasps</i> )

22:03.196 --> 22:04.740
She paid off
her cousin to help.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.617
This is unbelievable!

22:07.701 --> 22:10.287
{\an1}All this
to get rid of Ginger?

22:10.370 --> 22:13.081
And look at this.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.793
"Your best friends have
moved on, so why don't you?"

22:16.877 --> 22:18.420
(<i> gasps</i> ):
Oh, my gosh!

22:18.503 --> 22:23.341
This is total propaganda, if I'm
not using that word incorrectly.

22:23.425 --> 22:23.925
We have to get up there.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.178
We have to talk to Ginger.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.138
If she thinks
we've turned on her,

22:28.221 --> 22:30.766
she might actually
stay up there for good.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.852
Emergency after-school meeting
at my house.

22:33.935 --> 22:34.853
Oh, my gosh.

22:34.936 --> 22:35.896
What?

22:35.979 --> 22:37.439
It's just...

22:37.522 --> 22:40.776
That sounded like
something Ginger would say.
