[Dusty] You like root beer?

00:17.976 --> 00:19.144
Not really.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.895
'Cause I think we got some root beer.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.985
We got some Hellfire Cheezy Puffs
behind the counter.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.239
-Interested?
-No, thanks. Just... Just this.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.824
It was a trick question, anyway.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.493
I don't sell hellfire nothing.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.830
Screw 'em. Know what I mean? Zombies.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.249
[woman] How do you know I'm not a zombie?

00:42.208 --> 00:43.293
[Dusty] Uh... [chuckles]

00:43.376 --> 00:46.921
'Cause you ain't sucking my brain
out of its skull like I'm a damn oyster.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.137
[Dusty] You almost had me there.
"The night's young."

00:54.220 --> 00:55.305
I was almost buying it.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.182
But zombies don't come in here.

00:57.348 --> 00:59.934
-They know what's good for 'em.
-[woman] What makes you say that?

01:00.560 --> 01:03.855
Fillmore Graves makes us
stock self-tanning lotion,

01:03.938 --> 01:05.774
and we ain't sold a one of 'em.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.401
Zombies know they ain't welcome here!

01:09.944 --> 01:11.571
This here homey don't play!

01:13.073 --> 01:14.699
Time's nearly up for zombies.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.326
That I can tell you.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.120
We ain't gonna keep
letting ourselves be hostages.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.872
That's for damn sure.

01:26.753 --> 01:27.879
What's the hurry?

01:28.171 --> 01:29.422
Ain't no place to go.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.568
I should've known last night

02:31.651 --> 02:33.111
when I was more interested
in eating the pizza guy

02:33.194 --> 02:34.237
than the pizza itself.

Thank you, Great Zombie in the sky.
I am forever your humble servant.

That was mine.

I take it all back.

Whoever this was... Delicious.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.134
It was Thumb-Breaker Barnes.

It's a train wreck. That video, man.
That video is killing us.

to bump into their hooptie.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.405
And what's that got to do with us?

Turns out, humans don't like
seeing men of a certain...

on nice human ladies. Who knew?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.833

their pitchforks and their torches?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.793
I mean, you know how they get.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.088
It's six humans in particular
who should concern us.

04:57.171 --> 04:58.923
It's the six border patrol agents

04:59.007 --> 05:00.633
who we pay to look the other way

05:00.717 --> 05:02.927
when we're smuggling brains
through the south channel.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.639
I guess they used to think that
zombies were essentially decent.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.557
Some are.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.435
Well, now that they've seen
one of their own women-folk

05:10.518 --> 05:12.145
put through a debraining process,

05:12.228 --> 05:14.147

05:16.190 --> 05:17.525
So who's here?

05:19.277 --> 05:22.655
Think of all the people in the world
you'd enjoy seeing.

05:23.698 --> 05:24.866
It's none of them.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.996
They're petitioning me to let two humans
out of the city for a dance contest?

Mmm. "Dance of a Lifetime."

05:33.041 --> 05:34.125
No.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.711

Sadly, no.

I got a call from the brain plant
this morning with some disturbing news.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.404
They told you that?

06:03.738 --> 06:05.031
That we live in a quarantined city

06:05.114 --> 06:07.325
teetering between
self-destruction and annihilation?

06:08.076 --> 06:11.204
We delivered 1,200 fewer brains this week.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.705
Yeah.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.083
Annihilation may come
sooner than any of us would like

06:15.166 --> 06:16.459

06:16.751 --> 06:18.836
You're responsible for brains

06:18.920 --> 06:20.129
It's how you live like a king.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.256
It's why people are willing to pretend
that you're Jack Sparrow,

06:22.340 --> 06:23.508
and not Jack the Ripper.

06:23.758 --> 06:24.717

06:24.801 --> 06:26.844
Sounds like you got a PR problem.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.013
You should arrest a couple of zombies.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.556
Say they did it. Smash their heads.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.518

like the way I problem solve.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.958
I suggest you do nothing to screw it up.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.876
It's always my first choice.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.088
Then I'll leave you to it.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.680
I don't know why they expect you
to come riding to the rescue.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.392
-Well, I'll tell you, Don E.
-Please don't.

-I've seen it.
-Well, watch it again.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.200
We need all hands on deck on this one.

By now, I assume it's been swept up

08:31.511 --> 08:33.137
and is in a dumpster behind the salon.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.180
I love it.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.725

who murdered this poor woman.

We should probably
also figure out who this poor woman is.

It's a powder keg out there,
as I'm sure you've all noticed.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.588

09:07.672 --> 09:09.298
and bring these two zombies to justice,

09:09.382 --> 09:12.468

-Ravi, I'm okay.

All right.

[Liv] The victim is on her phone.

11:25.309 --> 11:29.647
So we check the nearest cell phone tower,
see who was pinging it at... 12:38.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.108
-See who we can't track down.
-And that's our victim.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.442
Yeah.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.198
I should ask Hobbs to do this.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.075
Hobbs likes telling people no.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.202
You brought this on yourself.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.330
Chase Graves
didn't let people leave the city.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.667
A-ha! But Chase Graves
had no interest in being popular,

11:49.750 --> 11:52.253
whereas being popular is what I live for.

11:53.629 --> 11:54.672
Commander?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.590
Jordan! Come in!

11:58.134 --> 12:00.469
-Thought you might want to see this.
-What is it?

12:00.553 --> 12:01.429
A deck of cards.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.597
We raided Warmbloods,
that human bar on 3rd.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.933
-I know the one.
-People were playing poker with these.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.604
Ah!

12:14.108 --> 12:17.153
Well, if they're playing cards,
they're not making IEDs.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.655
Hey! You're the ace of spades.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.323
The Saddam spot.

12:21.657 --> 12:22.783
Yuck it up, Uday.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.951
What are these?

12:24.618 --> 12:26.162
Applications to leave Seattle.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.330
Oh, what about this lady?

12:28.456 --> 12:29.498
Cynthia Rybnicki.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.835
Says here, she was visiting Seattle
when the wall went up.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.795
Her husband and kid are in Chicago.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.257
Does she require medical assistance
only available outside of Seattle?

12:38.507 --> 12:39.425
No.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.010
That's why it's in the reject pile.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.180
Man, your job sucks.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.265
Now you're just feeding his self-pity.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.351
No. Seriously.
I can't think of anything worse.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.771
Father of four in Cincinnati.
Early onset Alzheimer's.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.109
Or this lady who suffers
from cluster headaches,

12:57.902 --> 13:00.863
and if Renegade doesn't get her
to Seattle to be a zombie,

13:00.946 --> 13:03.699
she is moving to Oregon
to "go out on her own terms."

13:07.661 --> 13:08.579
Liv?

13:09.830 --> 13:10.915
Are you okay?

13:11.749 --> 13:13.209
We've gotta go get this kid.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.378
Astrocytomas. Inoperable.

13:17.963 --> 13:21.091
<i>If it was just a brain tumor,</i>
<i>well, whatever, </i>

13:21.634 --> 13:24.094
<i>but I'm in my fourth foster home.</i>

13:24.637 --> 13:26.305
<i>And each one gets worse. </i>

13:27.056 --> 13:29.225
<i>Phil is a pervert</i>

13:29.475 --> 13:31.185
<i>and Sandy is an enabler.</i>

13:31.852 --> 13:34.104
<i>I'm gonna stab him</i>
<i>if he ever touches me again. </i>

13:34.772 --> 13:37.775
<i>I can make it to Sacramento</i>
<i>if someone could meet me there. </i>

13:41.153 --> 13:42.530
Well, what are you waiting for?

14:06.971 --> 14:08.222
[beeping]

14:18.232 --> 14:19.358
Hey, Baron.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.947
This credit card
has about $200 left on it.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.324
Don't go crazy.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.500
You got any papers for me?

14:36.750 --> 14:39.420
-Papers?
-Travel docs for the kid I'm bringing in?

14:40.045 --> 14:42.923
You know, the ones that keep us
from getting lined up and shot?

14:45.259 --> 14:47.177
Whatever. She's here.

14:56.770 --> 14:57.897
[Baron] Renegade!

14:59.106 --> 15:00.399
You're looking fine.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.944
Baron, you are looking... the part.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.280
You gonna brief me, or what?

15:06.697 --> 15:09.742
[cameraman]
In three, two... [whispers] One.

15:11.035 --> 15:14.455
Good morning, and welcome to <i>Frostbites.</i>
I'm your host, Johnny Frost.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.916
Joining me this morning
to discuss the state of affairs

15:16.999 --> 15:19.168
in the city with balls behind the walls

15:19.251 --> 15:22.421
is Peyton Charles,
Seattle's de facto mayor.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.924
-I'm not the mayor.
-Acting mayor...

15:25.007 --> 15:28.052
Closer. I'm the chief of staff
to former mayor Floyd Baracus.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.511
<i>May he rest in peace. </i>

15:29.595 --> 15:32.640
<i>In any case, you look ravishing as usual. </i>

15:32.723 --> 15:35.517
-Oh, careful, mate.
<i>-Also with us </i>

15:35.601 --> 15:37.144
<i>is Seattle's </i>numero uno<i> CHIC</i>

15:37.227 --> 15:39.438
<i>and local business owner, Dolly Durkins. </i>

15:39.521 --> 15:43.067
Today, we'll be discussing
how to improve human-zombie relations.

15:43.150 --> 15:47.154
There's no such thing
as "improving human-zombie relations"

15:47.237 --> 15:51.075
any more than you can improve
"human-T-bone steak relations,"

15:51.158 --> 15:53.744
or "Bugs Bunny-carrot" relations.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.037
The clock...

15:55.287 --> 15:56.497
The clock is ticking.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.290
-Lovely.
-Yep.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.377
Dr. Grassly raved about you,

16:01.627 --> 16:03.796
said we'd be lucky
to have you on the team.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.214
Yeah, Jerry's a good dude.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.841
"Dr. Collier's a real life
<i>Good Will Hunting,"</i> he said.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.136
Said you weren't even enrolled
in his class. You just showed up.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.223
[chuckles] I was enrolled
at Johns Hopkins, though.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.392
It wasn't like I was polishing the floors.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.559
Jerry said you turned in work

16:17.643 --> 16:20.646
way beyond the capabilities
of all those privileged kids.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.524
I'm from Chappaqua.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.150
My parents are both doctors.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.821
-Hmm.
-Tell me about Dr. Chakrabarti.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.032
I heard that, when he worked here,
years before Seattle happened,

16:32.116 --> 16:34.576
he wrote a paper about
the potential for a zombie outbreak.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.537
-He did, indeed.
-How was it received?

16:36.745 --> 16:37.579
We fired him.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.081
Huh.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.958
But to Dr. Chakrabarti's credit,

16:41.041 --> 16:43.252
he has been nothing but gracious
in the wake of the outbreak.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.878
He's sending us all of his research.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.463
We're sending him everything we get.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.341
You'll be working closer to him
than anyone on our team.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.218
That's why I wanted this job.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.886
I'm a fan.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.306
[Peyton on TV] <i>You're suggesting that</i>
<i>Seattle's half a million humans </i>

16:56.390 --> 16:59.435

16:59.560 --> 17:01.562
<i>Stop! They're already dead. </i>

17:02.396 --> 17:05.774

Whoa! The morgue.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.660
This is where you keep
all the murdered people, huh?

17:16.744 --> 17:18.078
By definition, innit?

17:18.287 --> 17:19.455
Just put it there.

17:21.331 --> 17:24.585
[man] Order for Shark Body?

17:24.668 --> 17:26.420
Chakrabarti.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.048
Shark Body. Strange name.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.300
Is that a nickname?
You got a dorsal fin back there?

17:31.383 --> 17:33.635
Oi, mate. I'm watching.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.263
[Skype call ringing]

17:36.346 --> 17:37.556
You got a call there.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.772

17:44.855 --> 17:46.815
<i>-The man who did more with 30--</i>
-Who's that, then?

17:47.316 --> 17:50.110
Dr. Chakrabarti,
meet your new liaison, Dr. Collier.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.612
I'll let you two talk shop.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.989
<i>Dr. Collier has already</i>
<i>gone over your research, </i>

17:54.073 --> 17:55.783

<i>Dr. Chakrabarti, it is an--</i>

<i>What's this mess of veggies! </i>

18:03.290 --> 18:04.500
<i>Oi!</i>

18:07.461 --> 18:08.796
Dr. DeBeardo.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.381
Where's your better half?

18:11.882 --> 18:14.343
Not now, Blaine.
I've had a bit of a late one.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.594
I'm feeling a bit ropey.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.138
The man asked you a question.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.848
[Ravi growls]

18:20.265 --> 18:22.893
And I ignored it.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.814
Blaine, you wanna call off
your lady friend?

18:26.897 --> 18:29.566
I'm not gonna buy you a new one
if this one gets broken.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.696
And what's this?

18:36.073 --> 18:37.407
Is she crying?

18:38.492 --> 18:39.576
What's the matter?

18:40.285 --> 18:42.913
Somebody must've minced
that bucket of fish guts you call a face

18:42.996 --> 18:44.623
creating scarring near the drainage system

18:44.706 --> 18:48.127
thereby disrupting the normal
flow of tears through your ducts.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.796
Or is you just a muppet?

18:51.421 --> 18:53.674
-First one.
-Hmm.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.342
Maybe she's upstairs?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.469
Could be.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.054
Crybaby.

18:59.930 --> 19:00.931
Let's go.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.559
That's right. Go on.

19:07.020 --> 19:07.980
All right.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.489
<i>Maybe I caught you at a bad time. </i>

19:17.614 --> 19:20.742
-They're having a laugh.
-[Charli] <i>Okay, um...</i>

19:20.826 --> 19:23.412
<i>So, I spotted something</i>

19:23.704 --> 19:25.372
<i>I thought...</i>

19:25.455 --> 19:27.374
<i>...us versus them,</i>
<i>then you've been seduced by zombies.</i>

19:27.499 --> 19:30.460
<i>If anyone is doing any seducing,</i>
<i>it's Ms. Charles.</i>

19:31.253 --> 19:32.671
<i>I love this new cut on you.</i>

19:32.754 --> 19:33.672
Right!

19:35.382 --> 19:36.383
<i>Enough.</i>

19:37.759 --> 19:39.761
<i>Uh, Dr. Chakrabarti?</i>

19:40.053 --> 19:41.180
-This is Liv Moore...
-Zero...

19:41.263 --> 19:42.347
-...from the Seattle Police Department.
-...six, eight, one.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.891
-Please give me a call at this number...
-That matches what I've got.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.684
-...when you get this message.
-Thank you so much for your time.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.227
-[Liv] Thank you.
-Bye now.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.063
Okay.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.608
Only 19 left on my list.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.526
I'm down to 15.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.655
Seventy-two people were pinging
the cell phone tower at 12:38 that night.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.741
One of these people must be our victim.

20:00.824 --> 20:01.992
[sucks teeth]

20:03.702 --> 20:05.037
Mr. DeBeers.

20:06.622 --> 20:10.250
To what do we owe the emotions
we are currently experiencing?

20:10.334 --> 20:12.169
Good karma? Lady Luck?

20:12.252 --> 20:13.420
What do you want, Blaine?

20:13.629 --> 20:16.715
I'm so glad you asked... Renegade!

20:17.507 --> 20:19.259
Look, I wanna keep my hands clean.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.595
It's taken me so long
to get them this way,

20:21.678 --> 20:23.805
and if you don't hurry up
and catch whoever's responsible

20:23.889 --> 20:26.725
for pulverizing the sweet lady
on the gas station video,

20:27.309 --> 20:29.311
I'm afraid they might get dirty again.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.104
Nobody wants that.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.023
Not you. Not me.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.025
Not my corporate sponsors.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.694
So, you see this?

20:38.570 --> 20:39.738
This is ten grand.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.365
To me, this is nothing.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.326
If I take a nap and wake up,
another one appears.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.744
But you two...

20:46.370 --> 20:49.164
On your meager civil servant wages,

20:49.331 --> 20:51.833
this must be like a... A lot. Right?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.253
I'm sorry. Are you offering us a bribe?

20:54.544 --> 20:55.754
A bribe?

20:55.921 --> 20:56.964
What?

20:57.464 --> 21:00.092
Can't a citizen offer a reward

21:00.342 --> 21:03.387
for the capture of
a couple of no-goodniks? Huh?

21:03.845 --> 21:06.098
You have 48 hours. Then it's Blaine time.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.349
Who had six months

21:07.432 --> 21:09.226
in the "Blaine begins to speak
in third person" pool?

21:09.309 --> 21:12.479
Zombies are going hungry
because of this video,

21:12.562 --> 21:13.855
and that makes me sad.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.108
And I'm delivering
fewer brains to Major,

21:16.191 --> 21:18.694
which makes me less wealthy,
and that makes me sadder.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.446
-Go.
-Forty-eight hours.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.700
Blaine. You forgot this.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.702
Whoops!

21:27.286 --> 21:31.623
Sorry. I leave these everywhere.
Where's my head?

[Peyton] <i>...reforms instituted by</i>

21:33.875 --> 21:36.712
No separate justice system for zombies,

a system of review that allows humans

to leave the city.

-Plus, he's done away with the guillotine.
-Bring the guillotine back!

21:43.302 --> 21:47.264
It lets the zombies know that there were
consequences for breaking the law.

Need I remind you
about that innocent woman

21:49.683 --> 21:51.977

22:34.561 --> 22:36.063
How you feeling, kid?

22:39.816 --> 22:42.903
-Crappy.
-Well, that's why I'm here.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.991
Everything we told you to bring's
in that backpack, yeah?

22:48.075 --> 22:49.618
-Yeah.
-Good.

22:49.910 --> 22:53.246
'Cause we're gonna need it
when we cross the Washington border.

22:54.289 --> 22:57.584
Whoa! There's lots of benches
around here, folks. Move along.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.002
They're coming with us.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.505
[chuckles] Like hell they are.

23:03.006 --> 23:05.801
We're gonna make it to Seattle
with or without you.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.137
Oh, you most definitely are not going to
make it without me.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.681
Well, I guess you got a decision to make.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.391
There are some things worse than dying.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.353
Going back to our foster home
is one of them.

23:17.979 --> 23:18.939
You don't know what it's like--

23:19.022 --> 23:22.734
I know what foster homes are like, man.
Trust me.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.698
No. I've only got one ID for you.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.867
If we get stopped in Washington,
we're screwed.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.077
We're screwed if we stay here.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.955
Are we gonna talk or are we gonna
put some miles behind us?

23:35.247 --> 23:36.623
Oh... [chuckles]

23:37.415 --> 23:38.708
[sighs]

23:41.211 --> 23:43.672
I'm gonna regret this. I know it.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.383
Geezer had his hands all over you, though,
didn't he?

23:46.466 --> 23:48.218
Yeah? Your legs, your hair.

23:48.301 --> 23:52.055
He was trying to get you preggers
right in front of all of Seattle.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.475
Hello?

23:56.268 --> 23:57.269
[cell phone beeps]

23:57.352 --> 23:58.854
[Skype call ringing]

24:01.773 --> 24:07.404
<i>Dr. Chakrabarti, hope I haven't caught you</i>
<i>at a bad time, again.</i>

24:07.654 --> 24:09.698
<i>I came across something</i>
<i>I wanted to share with you.</i>

24:09.781 --> 24:10.907
Furry muff.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.367
<i>Uh...</i>

24:12.450 --> 24:17.122
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>You seemed a bit out of sorts, yesterday.</i>

24:17.205 --> 24:20.792
<i>I hope that I didn't do anything</i>
<i>to offend you, or--</i>

24:20.876 --> 24:22.377
What are you chattin' about?

24:22.460 --> 24:24.129
<i>-I have a theory.</i>
-[groans]

24:24.671 --> 24:28.091
Are you mullered?
It's day one, love. Chillax.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.509
[sighs]

24:29.634 --> 24:31.511
<i>The cured brain you sent us research on,</i>

24:31.761 --> 24:33.805
the White Girl?

24:34.264 --> 24:37.392
The antigens in the cure she took
created glycoproteins

24:37.475 --> 24:40.145
that essentially awakened
dormant cells in her brain.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.939
<i>I believe,</i>
<i>if we could generate those glycoproteins,</i>

24:43.023 --> 24:45.775
<i>they could lead to</i>
<i>a mass-produceable cure. </i>

24:46.318 --> 24:47.777
<i>So, I started thinking,</i>

24:47.861 --> 24:50.113
<i>is there anywhere that</i>
<i>they naturally occur?</i>

24:54.492 --> 24:56.703
<i>-Freylich Syndrome.</i>
-[groans]

24:56.786 --> 25:00.457
<i>It's rare. There are only 304 cases</i>
<i>in the United States,</i>

25:00.540 --> 25:02.125
<i>most victims die in their teens.</i>

25:02.209 --> 25:06.129
<i>But the condition causes an increase</i>
<i>in protein production in the brain</i>

25:06.213 --> 25:07.964
<i>leading, ultimately, to death.</i>

25:08.048 --> 25:08.965
[sniffs, clears throat]

25:09.049 --> 25:10.634
<i>I know. Awful.</i>

25:10.717 --> 25:12.302
<i>But I believe their postmortem brains</i>

25:12.385 --> 25:15.013
<i>will be full of the exact glycoprotein</i>
<i>that you found--</i>

25:15.096 --> 25:18.183
Drop it, yeah?
I'd move off that one if I was you.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.269
<i>Well, let me finish. If this were true--</i>

25:21.353 --> 25:24.231
Soz, mate. Won't work. Tried it.
All right?

25:26.149 --> 25:28.902
<i>Maybe you'd care to tell me what happened</i>
<i>when you tried it, then?</i>

25:28.985 --> 25:30.570
Oh, you're doing me head in now, girl.

25:31.529 --> 25:32.989
<i>I know I'm onto something.</i>

25:34.407 --> 25:35.450
<i>I'm gonna prove it.</i>

25:36.201 --> 25:39.579
<i>I'll tell my boss to have someone else</i>
<i>liaison with you from now on.</i>

25:39.663 --> 25:43.291
<i>So, bugger off, Doctor. All right?</i>

25:43.375 --> 25:44.960
Please, don't.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.462
<i>-Excuse me?</i>
-Did I stutter?

25:48.505 --> 25:49.506
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:51.424 --> 25:55.637
<i>You're right about Freylich's.</i>

25:57.055 --> 26:00.058
<i>You can derive a cure from the brain</i>
<i>of a late-stage sufferer of the disease. </i>

26:00.141 --> 26:02.602
<i>I know, because I have.</i>

26:03.478 --> 26:04.813
[exhales]

26:04.896 --> 26:06.189
Then, there's a cure.

26:06.273 --> 26:10.610
Yeah, it's wonderful. One dead kid.
One cured zombie.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.195
It's better than nothing.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.948
No. No, it's not.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.909
<i>You get on our conference call tomorrow</i>

26:17.993 --> 26:21.705
and tell your boss that Freylich brains
equal zombie cures,

26:21.788 --> 26:24.791
and suddenly,
these poor kids will be hunted.

26:24.874 --> 26:28.503
Their brains will be worth millions.
They'll have to go into hiding.

26:28.628 --> 26:29.629
[scoffs]

26:30.547 --> 26:32.299
People wouldn't hunt children.

26:33.341 --> 26:34.676
[grunts]

26:34.759 --> 26:36.469
Says little miss naive.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.723
I already promised my boss
that I was onto something big,

26:41.016 --> 26:43.018
but you've given me a lot to think about.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.603
Yeah? Thinking about how you're gonna

26:45.687 --> 26:48.898
spend all them millions you make
on zombie cures?

26:52.193 --> 26:54.404
-[gasps, pants]
-[Liv clears throat]

26:55.071 --> 26:58.158
I feel like I just watched
the Gollum-Sméagol scene

26:58.241 --> 27:01.119
from <i>Two Towers. </i>What was that?

27:01.661 --> 27:02.871
Oh, nothing.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.207
I may have just sentenced
300 kids to death.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.632
-Here you go, honey.
-[woman] Thank you.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.181
Hey there, honey. What can I do for you?

27:21.973 --> 27:26.186
Skate and chips. Triple batter. And a Tab.

27:28.605 --> 27:32.567
That's a pretty specific request.
You sure that's how you wanna go?

27:35.111 --> 27:36.071
Yeah.

27:38.698 --> 27:41.659
We'll get you when it's ready.
This one might take a while.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.802
Your order's ready. Follow me.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.225
Hop in.

28:14.776 --> 28:15.777
[sighs]

28:15.860 --> 28:18.113
-[Dolly] Did you make a video?
-Yeah.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.784
And a will?

28:22.867 --> 28:24.285
It's on there.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.165
You're a hero. You know that?

28:30.959 --> 28:32.544
They got my Jimmy and Sarah.

28:32.627 --> 28:35.588
Oh, no. Jimmy and Sarah deserve justice.

28:35.672 --> 28:39.134
So, we show 'em
what one good human can do.

28:46.307 --> 28:47.517
God bless.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.295
Got a call from a friend in Tacoma.

29:15.670 --> 29:16.796
Yeah?

29:16.880 --> 29:20.133
He says five of the six border agents
who work the south bay

29:20.508 --> 29:24.137
gone off the grid.
Snatched up as if by alien abduction.

29:25.138 --> 29:25.972
Blaine.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.640
[Jordan] Major!

29:28.224 --> 29:30.393
-Major.
-Commander.

29:30.810 --> 29:33.271
-Commander. You need to see this.
-See what?

29:33.730 --> 29:35.523
There's a brain line
a couple blocks that way.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.525
A couple of humans are taking pictures
of everyone in line,

29:38.109 --> 29:40.570
saying they're going to post them online
and out them as zombies.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.489
[Spud] I'm not saying we shoot 'em,

29:43.114 --> 29:45.825
but I'll bet if we smack 'em around a bit,
we can get 'em to give up photography.

29:46.075 --> 29:48.328
Technically, they're not
breaking any laws.

29:48.703 --> 29:50.997
-Our new mandates don't allow--
-Let's take a look.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.881
-Excuse me. Detective Babineaux?
-That's me.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.132
I had this note on my door

30:01.216 --> 30:03.301
asking my girlfriend Lisa Gertz
to give you a call.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.136
Ah...

30:06.679 --> 30:08.848
When's the last time you saw Lisa, Mr...

30:08.932 --> 30:10.391
Cahill. Bix Cahill.

30:10.725 --> 30:11.935
It's been a few days.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.645
Is that strange?

30:13.853 --> 30:16.231
We live together, but she's at
a work retreat this week, so...

30:16.564 --> 30:18.858
Have you seen the video of the woman

30:18.942 --> 30:21.236
being dragged into the car
of a couple zombies?

30:21.319 --> 30:23.988
We haven't been able
to identify the victim.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.115
You think maybe it's Lisa.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.700
It's probably not. We just...

30:27.784 --> 30:29.160
[breathing shallowly]

30:29.244 --> 30:32.330
Mr. Cahill, there are still
several women it could be.

30:33.706 --> 30:36.459
Can I get you something?
A water? A coffee?

30:36.793 --> 30:39.254
-Decaf?
-Coffee sounds great.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.005
Uh, French roast? Hazelnut?

30:41.464 --> 30:43.091
Oh, I was kinda hoping for a latte.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.509
Seattle.

30:44.717 --> 30:48.805
Harris, can you run down the street
and grab us a decaf latte, please?

30:48.888 --> 30:50.014
No problem, Detective.

31:12.036 --> 31:13.371
[exhales]

31:13.538 --> 31:15.123
[car engine starting]

31:16.666 --> 31:18.042
Photographers must've seen us coming.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.460
They sure hightailed it out of there.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.046
They're gonna keep coming back
if we don't do something about it.

31:23.506 --> 31:24.841
[tires screeching]

31:27.594 --> 31:29.220
What the hell?

31:31.514 --> 31:32.557
Oh, God, no.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.267
[soldier] Go, go, go! Incoming!

31:35.935 --> 31:36.978
Stop!

31:37.312 --> 31:39.272
[soldiers shouting]

31:43.192 --> 31:45.111
[explosion]

31:46.070 --> 31:47.906
[soldiers screaming]

31:58.458 --> 31:59.751
Let us call you a taxi.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.545
We'll call as soon as we know anything.

32:02.837 --> 32:03.755
Yeah, okay.

32:06.507 --> 32:09.427
Locate My Device! We can use the
Locate My Device app to find each other.

32:09.886 --> 32:10.720
Please, please, please.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.224
Hardy Park?

32:15.683 --> 32:18.061
[multiple telephones
ringing simultaneously]

32:18.144 --> 32:20.563
Mr. Cahill, my partner and I
will take it from here.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.399
-As soon as we know something...
-[officer 1] Okay. We're on our way.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.943
All right, let's go.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.404
[officer 2] We're headed out there now.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.490
Harris! Harris. What's happening?

32:30.573 --> 32:33.743
Explosion at a Fillmore Graves
checkpoint. Multiple fatalities.

32:35.411 --> 32:37.246
Liv, our services are required.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.962
[man grunts, pants]

32:58.309 --> 32:59.560
Never gets old.

33:00.436 --> 33:01.521
[Blaine] Gentlemen!

33:02.605 --> 33:04.023
Welcome to New Seattle.

33:06.651 --> 33:11.447
Sorry for the rough ride.
Such is life under an embargo.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.574
[snaps fingers]

33:16.536 --> 33:19.288
We had a deal, didn't we?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.624
I fill your bank accounts,

33:21.833 --> 33:25.837
and you let my brain shipments
pass your border checkpoint.

33:26.546 --> 33:30.925
I've held up my end. But, fellas and lady,

33:32.635 --> 33:34.429
you quit holding up yours.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.639
[mumbles incoherently]

33:48.026 --> 33:50.278
That was before we saw zombies
eat that poor woman alive.

33:50.611 --> 33:56.075
Ah, yeah. The video. It presents a real...

33:56.492 --> 33:58.369
What did I say it presents again?

33:58.453 --> 33:59.662
-An ethical dilemma.
-Moral quandary.

33:59.746 --> 34:00.580
Right.

34:00.663 --> 34:04.042
You said zombies were like everyone else,
that they weren't monsters.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.336
Agent William Fife,
you didn't read the fine print.

34:08.087 --> 34:09.922
Don E, what does it say
under that six-point text?

34:10.214 --> 34:12.759
-"Unless they get hungry."
-[Blaine] Right.

34:13.718 --> 34:18.306
Yeah, when we're hungry,
we can be real scamps.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.891
You gotta read that fine print.

34:20.224 --> 34:23.686
If you keep preventing my brains
from coming through the checkpoint,

34:23.770 --> 34:26.314
there's going to be
so many more hungry zombies.

34:27.356 --> 34:31.569
You'd be surprised how much
personal information is available online.

34:31.986 --> 34:33.529
Most people don't know how to find it,

34:33.613 --> 34:36.866
but if you got a PhD
in information science, you can.

34:36.949 --> 34:40.203
And I managed to get my doctorate
over breakfast this morning.

34:41.370 --> 34:46.167
And, man, this lady floating around
in my brain had a mind like a steel trap.

34:46.250 --> 34:50.630
I remember every detail I read
about the five of you.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.965
Do that guy. I don't like his attitude.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.092
-The little guy?
-[Don E] Yeah.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.134
[Blaine] Okay.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.056
Agent Ross.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.599
Your grandma Christine raised you

35:01.682 --> 35:06.020
after your parents died in a car crash
outside of Missoula, Montana in '92.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.356
Grandma Chris is an avid golfer

35:08.439 --> 35:10.316
and a member
of the Spokane Golf and Country Club.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.859
Can still be found there

35:12.068 --> 35:15.029
every Thursday at 8:00 a.m.
for her weekly tee time.

35:15.113 --> 35:18.699
I mean, that's where I'd find her,
were I to go looking.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.622
Agent Clarke.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.750
I'm so sorry you had to miss
your son's soccer game today.

35:29.085 --> 35:33.548
He's got another one next week.
Blackburn Park. 4:30. Field 7.

35:36.884 --> 35:40.138
That was a touching obituary
you wrote for your dog Freckles

35:40.221 --> 35:43.766
when you were ten, Agent Stevens.
It was heartbreaking, really.

35:44.559 --> 35:48.980
That's a word I don't use lightly.
In fact, it's a word I don't use at all.

35:50.606 --> 35:53.943
I do hope Tacoma Kennels are looking after
your chocolate lab Muggsy,

35:54.026 --> 35:55.570
so that you don't have to write another

35:55.653 --> 35:57.488
-tearjerker anytime soon.
-[Fife] Okay, we get it.

35:58.072 --> 35:59.782
So, if we don't start
letting your shipments through again,

35:59.866 --> 36:01.868
what, you're gonna turn our dogs
and families into zombies?

36:01.951 --> 36:05.037
No. Silly billy, Willie Fife.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.292
I'm gonna turn you into zombies.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.086
And I'm going to kill your loved ones,

36:12.170 --> 36:16.340
be they young, old, human or canine.

36:17.300 --> 36:22.263
Or you could go back to
honoring our arrangement, yeah?

36:22.638 --> 36:24.265
Yeah? Great.

36:26.184 --> 36:30.188
Threaten me all you want, whitey.
I don't work for zombies anymore.

36:45.661 --> 36:47.330
[Skype call ringing]

36:52.752 --> 36:53.920
<i>Everyone's on time for once.</i>

36:55.046 --> 36:57.089
<i>I believe you all have had a chance</i>
<i>to meet Dr. Collier.</i>

36:57.798 --> 37:01.052
<i>I'm excited to get the show</i>
<i>on the road this morning as Dr. Collier</i>

37:01.135 --> 37:04.513
<i>intimated to me that she</i>
<i>had something big to share with us. </i>

37:05.848 --> 37:06.724
[typing]

37:06.891 --> 37:09.268
<i>Shouldn't we let Dr. Collier</i>
<i>get her feet wet first? </i>

37:09.352 --> 37:11.187
<i>Really get the lay of the land?</i>

37:11.270 --> 37:13.064
<i>Don't let her humble origins</i>
<i>fool you, Ravi. </i>

37:13.147 --> 37:14.273
<i>This one is a hard worker.</i>

37:15.858 --> 37:18.486
<i>Go ahead, Dr. Collier.</i>
<i>Walk us through your findings.</i>

37:18.569 --> 37:20.238
<i>What was this big discovery? </i>

37:20.321 --> 37:21.614
[Charli] <i>Freylich Syndrome.</i>

37:22.365 --> 37:27.870
<i>I believe their postmortem brains</i>
<i>would be full of the exact glycoprotein</i>

37:27.954 --> 37:30.039
<i>you found in White Girl's. </i>

37:30.122 --> 37:32.959
<i>If this were true,</i>
<i>we could extract a serum--</i>

37:33.042 --> 37:33.876
<i>A cure.</i>

37:36.963 --> 37:38.297
But I miscalculated.

37:39.131 --> 37:43.094
<i>We would need hundreds of thousands</i>
<i>of pounds of brains. </i>

37:43.594 --> 37:45.930
<i>It's impractical. It can't work.</i>

37:50.768 --> 37:51.936
<i>Sorry, everyone. False alarm.</i>

37:53.854 --> 37:56.107
<i>From now on, Dr. Collier, baby steps.</i>

37:56.691 --> 38:00.611
<i>I suggest you lean on Dr. White</i>
<i>and Dr. Rich as you're starting out.</i>

38:02.780 --> 38:05.199
<i>Professor Mann is also a good resource.</i>

38:11.914 --> 38:13.332
[Major] Have we found the VIN
on that vehicle?

38:13.416 --> 38:15.126
They're still sifting
through the wreckage.

38:21.173 --> 38:24.385
Just heard. Four border agents
in Tacoma back on the job.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.470
The brain plant's back at capacity.

38:27.513 --> 38:29.807
There were five border agents.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.852
You did what you had to do.

38:35.896 --> 38:38.941
[indistinct radio chatter]

38:54.957 --> 38:56.042
[trooper] ID.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.428
Should I print a wallet-size for you?

39:25.988 --> 39:26.947
Where you headed?

39:27.740 --> 39:30.201
-Yakima.
-What's in Yakima?

39:32.036 --> 39:35.539
Uh, it's the hops capital of America.

39:36.957 --> 39:41.837
Birthplace of Cooper Kupp,
split end for the Rams. You like football?

39:42.380 --> 39:44.256
I meant, what takes you to Yakima?

39:44.423 --> 39:46.842
Oh. Uh, my grandma lives there.

39:51.764 --> 39:52.848
[sighs]

40:15.579 --> 40:17.289
-[trooper] I'm guessing you don't have ID.
-[sighs]

40:21.710 --> 40:26.006
If I'm going off memory,
Mr. Cahill's Locate My Device app

40:26.507 --> 40:28.592
got a ping from right around here.

40:30.136 --> 40:33.013
[Liv] How many bodies
have we pulled out of these woods?

40:33.931 --> 40:35.474
[Clive] I can remember three.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.893
This is the spot where lazy murderers

40:37.977 --> 40:41.105
who don't want to fight traffic
dispose of their victims.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.941
I don't want to see
another dead body today, Clive.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.026
Those poor soldiers.

40:47.319 --> 40:49.238
Yeah, that was rough.

40:50.364 --> 40:52.366
[quiet whimpering]

41:05.421 --> 41:07.131
I found her phone.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.258
And her jacket.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.471
She's gone. Lisa's gone.
