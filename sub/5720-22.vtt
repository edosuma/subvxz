WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.667
<i>Previously on</i> Madam Secretary...

00:01.668 --> 00:04.567
We're in therapy so
we can work through it.

00:04.568 --> 00:05.649
We're in therapy

00:05.650 --> 00:08.232
<i>because I can't accept
what happened to Dmitri,</i>

00:08.233 --> 00:10.159
<i>and what's still
happening to his sister.</i>

00:10.160 --> 00:12.673
ADMIRAL PARKER: Images show
the I-8 district of Islamabad,

00:12.674 --> 00:14.603
where Jibral Disah is
said to be sheltered,

00:14.604 --> 00:16.858
to be a highly exposed residential area.

00:16.859 --> 00:20.068
DALTON: <i>We'll give Murphy
Station a diplomatic cover.</i>

00:20.069 --> 00:23.148
Conrad wants you guys working
from inside the embassy,

00:23.149 --> 00:25.278
and that's what's gonna
let me sleep at night.

00:25.279 --> 00:27.438
(crowd shouting)

00:27.439 --> 00:30.938
WOMAN (over P.A.): The embassy
is under an evacuation order.

00:30.939 --> 00:33.608
JSOC is ready to initiate
render safe, Mr. President.

00:33.609 --> 00:36.278
I'd like to wait until all of
our citizens are out of danger.

00:36.279 --> 00:38.148
ELIZABETH: I appreciate
that, Mr. President.

00:38.149 --> 00:42.148
But securing over 100 nuclear
warheads in a fallen regime,

00:42.149 --> 00:45.488
with ties to multiple jihadist
groups, has to take precedence.

00:45.489 --> 00:47.938
I didn't travel halfway around
the world to get on a chopper

00:47.939 --> 00:49.522
the moment we have Disah in our sights.

00:49.523 --> 00:51.398
Have you looked outside?

00:51.399 --> 00:52.778
This city is falling apart.

00:52.779 --> 00:55.238
Which is the perfect cover
we need to get this done.

00:55.239 --> 00:56.502
JOSE: <i>This is finishing the job</i>

00:56.503 --> 00:57.608
<i>we came here to do...</i>

00:57.609 --> 00:59.318
<i>to kill Jibral Disah.</i>

01:11.699 --> 01:12.788
Elizabeth...

01:12.789 --> 01:13.998
CENTCOM just received

01:13.999 --> 01:15.422
a coded e-mail from Murphy Station.

01:15.423 --> 01:16.948
They got a hit on

01:16.949 --> 01:19.498
Jibral Disah's location and
decided to stay in Islamabad.

01:19.499 --> 01:21.658
(sighs deeply)

01:21.659 --> 01:24.769
Please, tell me they
have a Marine detail.

01:25.409 --> 01:26.828
Things are fluid.

01:26.829 --> 01:28.038
We're trying to reach them.

01:28.039 --> 01:29.099
(door opens, closes)

01:29.100 --> 01:30.158
Yeah... me, too.

01:30.159 --> 01:33.038
Two hours ago, I was
at a pancake social

01:33.039 --> 01:36.208
in Dixville Notch,
charming party insiders,

01:36.209 --> 01:37.828
when the guy at the syrup bar

01:37.829 --> 01:40.158
tells me Pakistan is imploding.

01:40.159 --> 01:42.658
Thanks for making it back so quickly.

01:42.659 --> 01:44.038
Mr. President...

01:44.039 --> 01:45.708
Mr. Jackson, welcome back.

01:45.709 --> 01:47.809
You're all needed
in the Situation Room.

01:49.159 --> 01:52.078
Another slow day at the office.

01:52.079 --> 01:56.307
Prime Minister Khoosat was unfit
to lead the people of Pakistan,

01:56.308 --> 01:58.248
and the people rightly took
to the streets to demonstrate...

01:58.249 --> 01:59.448
DALTON: What's going on?

01:59.449 --> 02:01.158
Abedi just declared himself

02:01.159 --> 02:03.389
the new Prime Minister of Pakistan.

02:04.709 --> 02:07.248
Does he have the military behind him?

02:07.249 --> 02:08.124
Unclear.

02:08.125 --> 02:08.997
Though it's totally

02:08.999 --> 02:11.538
clear that he's in league
with Hizb Al-Shahid.

02:11.539 --> 02:12.868
DALTON: Let the Chief of the Army Staff

02:12.869 --> 02:14.328
and his principal officers know that

02:14.329 --> 02:16.368
the United States does
not recognize Abedi,

02:16.369 --> 02:19.248
and they would be wise to do the same.

02:19.249 --> 02:21.592
Where are we on wrapping up
their nuclear weapons, Admiral?

02:21.593 --> 02:24.248
Special Operation Forces
out of Afghanistan and Qatar

02:24.249 --> 02:25.288
are en route.

02:25.289 --> 02:26.748
Before they breach Pakistani

02:26.749 --> 02:28.578
airspace, CYBERCOM'll
be paving the road.

02:28.579 --> 02:30.908
We already killed most of
the power grid and all comms.

02:30.909 --> 02:33.564
Still working on jamming their
surface-to-air missile capabilities.

02:33.565 --> 02:34.248
But just in case,

02:34.249 --> 02:35.809
we're bringing in every available drone

02:35.810 --> 02:37.273
to clean up any bumps along the way.

02:37.274 --> 02:38.723
Then what?

02:39.499 --> 02:42.038
Pakistan's 110 nuclear weapons

02:42.039 --> 02:45.578
are stored in 12 bunkers,
scattered all over the country.

02:45.579 --> 02:47.482
We'll be handling the
seven in the northern half

02:47.483 --> 02:48.908
that account for 68 bombs.

02:48.909 --> 02:52.158
The Russians will be taking
the five bunkers in the south.

02:52.159 --> 02:54.078
However, far as we can tell,

02:54.079 --> 02:56.368
the Russians haven't
launched any units yet.

02:56.369 --> 02:58.908
I can reach out to
Minister Avdonin about that.

02:58.909 --> 03:01.248
How long do we expect all this to take?

03:01.249 --> 03:03.618
Assuming our Intel on
bunker locations is good,

03:03.619 --> 03:06.408
six hours till taillights
over the border.

03:06.409 --> 03:08.912
COLONEL: Mr. President, I have
Murphy Station on the line, sir.

03:08.913 --> 03:10.618
DALTON: Put them on speaker, Colonel.

03:10.619 --> 03:12.498
Give us your status, Murphy.

03:12.499 --> 03:15.038
En route to Islamabad's I-8 district.

03:15.039 --> 03:16.368
If our Intel is right,

03:16.369 --> 03:18.618
we should be staking out
Jibral Disah's location

03:18.619 --> 03:19.998
in about 30 minutes.

03:19.999 --> 03:21.498
Hey, it's Elizabeth.

03:21.499 --> 03:23.288
McCord.

03:23.289 --> 03:24.658
Hey.

03:24.659 --> 03:26.498
You should know

03:26.499 --> 03:28.078
we've initiated an operation to...

03:28.079 --> 03:29.118
(honking horn)

03:29.119 --> 03:31.788
...secure all of Pakistan's nuclear

03:31.789 --> 03:34.708
weapons, so... most of
their power grid's down.

03:34.709 --> 03:36.012
We'll be coming in pretty heavy,

03:36.013 --> 03:37.658
with Russian Special Forces joining in.

03:37.659 --> 03:39.368
FELLOWS: Copy that.

03:39.369 --> 03:40.448
Get it done and get out.

03:40.449 --> 03:41.288
(crowd shouting)

03:41.289 --> 03:42.748
Murphy Station, could you, uh,

03:42.749 --> 03:44.349
could you give us a second?

03:45.619 --> 03:48.158
Mr. President, there are riots

03:48.159 --> 03:49.302
raging throughout Islamabad.

03:49.303 --> 03:50.328
I, uh...

03:50.329 --> 03:52.788
I'm questioning the wisdom of leaving

03:52.789 --> 03:55.038
three high value assets
to take out this terrorist,

03:55.039 --> 03:57.328
in a rapidly deteriorating situation,

03:57.329 --> 03:59.328
while we have bigger fish to fry.

03:59.329 --> 04:01.408
You want to abort the Disah mission.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.788
As much as I would love to light that

04:03.789 --> 04:04.948
son of a bitch up,

04:04.949 --> 04:07.809
render safe has to be our priority.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.099
Elizabeth?

04:13.999 --> 04:16.678
I think we should back
Murphy Station's play, sir.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.077
Walk and chew gum at the
same time, it is then.

04:21.079 --> 04:23.368
Let's get it done. All of it.

04:23.369 --> 04:24.658
Yes, sir.

04:24.659 --> 04:26.219
Maybe she's sick of you.

04:27.409 --> 04:28.759
(Jose laughs)

04:30.369 --> 04:32.259
Ma'am.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.708
It's Allison. She says
it's an emergency.

04:40.709 --> 04:42.828
Ali, baby, what's going on?
Are you okay?

04:42.829 --> 04:44.812
You didn't sign the New
York trip permission slip.

04:44.813 --> 04:47.408
So you're not bleeding out
on the street somewhere?

04:47.409 --> 04:50.078
I left it on the coffee
maker last night.

04:50.079 --> 04:52.368
Well, I ended up staying
at work all night.

04:52.369 --> 04:54.828
Oh, yeah, that'll fly with Dean Ward.

04:54.829 --> 04:56.972
Quaker education is all
about personal responsibility.

04:56.973 --> 04:59.408
You know Richard Nixon was a Quaker.

04:59.409 --> 05:00.809
Just saying.

05:02.119 --> 05:04.328
If it's not signed by 3:00,
I'll be stuck in study hall

05:04.329 --> 05:06.072
while all of my friends
are seeing <i>Hamilton.</i>

05:06.073 --> 05:08.038
Oh, <i>Hamilton, </i> well...

05:08.039 --> 05:09.908
I'll have Blake take care of it.

05:09.909 --> 05:12.328
But listen, no more saying
that it's an emergency

05:12.329 --> 05:14.639
unless there are paramedics
or SWAT teams involved.

05:16.289 --> 05:17.889
I love you, baby.

05:19.539 --> 05:20.748
What am I taking care of?

05:20.749 --> 05:23.259
Appeasing a fascist Quaker.

05:24.749 --> 05:26.408
Minister Avdonin,

05:26.409 --> 05:27.828
thanks for coming,

05:27.829 --> 05:29.332
but a phone call would have sufficed.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.538
I wanted to tell you in person

05:30.539 --> 05:33.809
that Russia has decided to
back Abedi as prime minister.

05:35.709 --> 05:36.874
You can't be serious.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.038
Madam Secretary...

05:38.039 --> 05:40.368
Of course you're serious. But... Abedi?

05:40.369 --> 05:43.658
Who basically murdered the
legitimate prime minister

05:43.659 --> 05:46.658
and is in bed with the
worst terrorists on Earth?

05:46.659 --> 05:47.708
That guy?

05:47.709 --> 05:50.038
Pakistan has a long
history of cooperating

05:50.039 --> 05:51.681
- with jihadist groups.
- But none of them

05:51.682 --> 05:55.078
ever set off a dirty bomb
inside the United States.

05:55.079 --> 05:59.828
We will never get behind anybody
associated with Hizb Al-Shahid.

05:59.829 --> 06:02.788
That's...

06:02.789 --> 06:04.639
Oh, my God.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.498
You're backing out of render safe.

06:08.499 --> 06:11.158
We agreed to it before Abedi took power.

06:11.159 --> 06:12.498
Abedi hasn't taken power,

06:12.499 --> 06:15.578
and it is absurd to think that

06:15.579 --> 06:17.618
he could hold that country together.

06:17.619 --> 06:20.448
Our intelligence agencies
have already seen fissures

06:20.449 --> 06:21.578
in the Pakistani military.

06:21.579 --> 06:24.038
Are those the same
intelligence agencies

06:24.039 --> 06:27.099
that were so sure Russia
hacked Air Force One?

06:29.159 --> 06:33.618
Konstantin, our joint render
safe plan has been in place

06:33.619 --> 06:37.139
for years, and it's happening now.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.658
You can't just back out of it

06:40.659 --> 06:42.448
like it's an annoying dinner party.

06:42.449 --> 06:45.078
(phone blipping, buzzing)

06:45.079 --> 06:46.288
I should let you go.

06:46.289 --> 06:48.259
There's nothing more to discuss.

06:49.499 --> 06:51.139
(sighs)

06:53.709 --> 06:54.708
Hello.

06:54.709 --> 06:55.708
You okay?

06:55.709 --> 06:56.748
I'm...

06:56.749 --> 06:58.038
(sighs)

06:58.039 --> 07:00.948
I'm okay, I'm... I'm...

07:00.949 --> 07:03.038
Yeah. I'm...

07:03.039 --> 07:05.078
We got this.

07:05.079 --> 07:06.208
Seriously, don't worry.

07:06.209 --> 07:07.828
I believe you.

07:07.829 --> 07:11.658
Look, I-I don't want to hang up,
Henry, but I-I just found out

07:11.659 --> 07:14.042
the Russians are bailing on us,
and I've got to brief POTUS.

07:14.043 --> 07:14.889
Wait, don't hang up.

07:14.890 --> 07:15.828
Go.

07:15.829 --> 07:17.929
Just hold on.

07:20.369 --> 07:24.448
Look, I know I wasn't
marrying a couch potato and...

07:24.449 --> 07:26.828
I don't know how to say this.

07:26.829 --> 07:29.038
I...

07:29.039 --> 07:33.509
I love you, so don't die on me, okay?

07:35.369 --> 07:36.788
Copy that.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.368
And I love you.

07:38.369 --> 07:39.618
Now I gotta go, too.

07:39.619 --> 07:41.969
(sighs)

07:48.209 --> 07:50.599
Yeah, the two-story one
with the blue trim.

07:54.539 --> 07:57.049
SUVs out front.

07:59.249 --> 08:01.908
They could be out of there
pretty quick, if they had to.

08:01.909 --> 08:04.078
Son of a bitch is in there.

08:04.079 --> 08:06.078
I can feel the dark side

08:06.079 --> 08:07.408
of the Force.

08:07.409 --> 08:09.748
Well, we wait until we see him.

08:09.749 --> 08:11.158
I'll call for a drone.

08:11.159 --> 08:13.549
Or a droid.

08:16.449 --> 08:19.038
President Salnikov won't budge.

08:19.039 --> 08:20.158
We're on our own.

08:20.159 --> 08:22.038
So what does that look like, Admiral?

08:22.039 --> 08:24.998
Five more sites,
hundreds of miles apart.

08:24.999 --> 08:27.618
It'll extend the mission
to closer to ten hours.

08:27.619 --> 08:29.868
Can't we move faster
by destroying the bombs?

08:29.869 --> 08:31.572
PARKER: Yes, sir,
transporting the warheads

08:31.573 --> 08:33.038
is the most time-consuming part.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.578
We can switch to disarming them,

08:34.578 --> 08:36.578
removing the nuclear material, and then

08:36.578 --> 08:38.828
hitting the bunkers with drones.

08:38.828 --> 08:42.509
It'll save two hours, more or less.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.078
It's noisy...

08:45.079 --> 08:46.448
and messy.

08:46.449 --> 08:47.708
Certainly be more casualties.

08:47.709 --> 08:48.788
And it'll look

08:48.789 --> 08:50.448
a hell of a lot more like an invasion.

08:50.449 --> 08:54.498
PARKER: All of the above, and
it'll stretch our drone capacity,

08:54.499 --> 08:56.049
but it'll get the job done.

09:03.159 --> 09:04.408
Do it, Admiral.

09:04.409 --> 09:05.809
Sir.

09:11.449 --> 09:13.498
Where are we with Murphy Station?

09:13.499 --> 09:16.038
We should've grabbed some food.

09:16.039 --> 09:18.310
While the embassy was being
overrun? That's a good idea.

09:18.311 --> 09:21.415
JOSE: How long would it have taken to
stop and get some take-out or something?

09:21.416 --> 09:23.155
Guys, guys, front door open.

09:25.039 --> 09:26.618
Any of them Disah?

09:26.619 --> 09:28.708
FELLOWS: I don't see him, damn it.

09:28.709 --> 09:30.658
HENRY: <i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

09:30.659 --> 09:32.038
<i>Long black coat in the back.</i>

09:32.039 --> 09:33.828
Yep, I'm confirming.

09:33.829 --> 09:34.828
It's him.

09:34.829 --> 09:36.012
Murphy Station to Reaper One.

09:36.013 --> 09:38.908
Requesting strike at 4-3-S-C-T-2-8.

09:38.909 --> 09:39.998
Two SUVs. Over.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.578
TOC COMMANDER: Copy, Murphy Station.

09:41.579 --> 09:43.408
Reaper One incoming,
rendezvous three minutes.

09:43.409 --> 09:44.868
What the hell happened

09:44.869 --> 09:47.408
to the one I requested to be
standing by an hour ago?! Over.

09:47.409 --> 09:48.748
Pulling double duty.

09:48.749 --> 09:50.788
Just under three minutes. Incoming.

09:50.789 --> 09:51.618
The phone's not with them.

09:51.619 --> 09:52.661
- What?
- It's not moving.

09:52.662 --> 09:53.658
It's still in the house.

09:53.659 --> 09:55.162
No time, Reaper One, losing our eyes.

09:55.163 --> 09:57.828
We need a strike right now,
damn it. Over.

09:57.829 --> 09:59.412
Copy. Two and a half minutes. Incoming.

09:59.413 --> 10:00.538
I'm gonna kill this guy.

10:00.539 --> 10:02.238
- We gotta follow them or we'll lose them.
- No.

10:02.239 --> 10:03.659
- Three minutes, they'll be gone.
- FELLOWS: But at least...

10:03.660 --> 10:04.828
They'll make us in three seconds.

10:04.829 --> 10:06.349
FELLOWS: Then we'll keep our distance.

10:06.350 --> 10:08.093

to finishing the damn job?

11:52.788 --> 11:54.327

11:59.738 --> 12:01.241

As long as the adrenaline.

12:03.368 --> 12:04.628
- Let's go.
- Okay.

12:09.528 --> 12:11.407
Our render safe unit in Kohat took

12:11.408 --> 12:12.951
more fire than expected, which held...

12:12.952 --> 12:13.867
You're telling me

12:13.868 --> 12:15.367
they killed Jibral Disah,

12:15.368 --> 12:18.027
the most wanted terrorist
on Earth, and JSOC

12:18.028 --> 12:22.027
doesn't have anybody
available to pick these guys up?

12:22.028 --> 12:23.628
If there were, ma'am,
I can assure you...

12:23.629 --> 12:26.077
DALTON: We would've
already made the call.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.737
Bess, Murphy Station
is our top priority.

12:28.738 --> 12:32.697
It sounds like Jose

12:32.698 --> 12:33.867
We're making sure medical

12:33.868 --> 12:35.907
personnel are part of the exfil team.

12:35.908 --> 12:37.487
In the meantime, they're seeking cover.

12:37.488 --> 12:40.027
Do we even know where?

12:40.028 --> 12:42.128
(glass breaks)

12:56.578 --> 12:57.947
Set up back there.

12:57.948 --> 12:59.651
All right, I'll check

12:59.652 --> 13:00.752
Okay.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.198
Where's the gun?

13:21.199 --> 13:21.987
I got it, I got it.

13:21.988 --> 13:23.211
- (speaking Urdu)
- Keep quiet.

13:23.212 --> 13:24.407
- Anyone hit?
- Be quiet. No.

13:24.408 --> 13:26.008
No thanks to Hamlet McCord here.

13:27.488 --> 13:28.577
Sit down.

13:28.578 --> 13:29.867
Stay right there.

13:29.868 --> 13:31.251
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.

13:31.252 --> 13:32.197
Why the hell not?

13:32.198 --> 13:33.388
He could've killed us!

13:33.389 --> 13:34.577
Just tell him!

13:34.578 --> 13:36.407
Tell him we're here to help.

13:36.408 --> 13:38.907
(Jose speaks Urdu)

13:38.908 --> 13:41.407
(speaking Urdu)

13:41.408 --> 13:44.407
We just want to go home
safely to our families.

13:53.118 --> 13:54.218
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

13:55.948 --> 13:57.487
Any word on Henry?

13:57.488 --> 14:00.117
No, ma'am. Sorry.
And, uh, given how much

14:00.118 --> 14:02.261
is on your mind, I feel silly
even bringing this up...

14:02.262 --> 14:03.283
Alison's permission slip.

14:03.284 --> 14:04.447
Yeah.

14:04.448 --> 14:05.787
No problem.

14:05.788 --> 14:07.968
We got to walk and chew gum,
POTUS's orders.

14:09.618 --> 14:11.527
Okay.

14:11.528 --> 14:12.827
See?

14:12.828 --> 14:14.902
Walking and chewing gum.

14:14.903 --> 14:15.623
We got this.

14:15.624 --> 14:16.571
Well, I'm glad you feel that way,

14:16.572 --> 14:18.036
because the Chinese foreign minister

14:18.037 --> 14:19.103
has requested a meeting.

14:19.104 --> 14:21.282
He and every other
Security Council member.

14:21.283 --> 14:23.702
They want to yell at us
for breaking Pakistan.

14:23.703 --> 14:24.992
Yes, but, uh,

14:24.993 --> 14:26.902
Minister Chen has been
particularly insistent.

14:26.903 --> 14:29.032
Well, China shares a
border with Pakistan.

14:29.033 --> 14:30.362
I get it, but not today.

14:30.363 --> 14:32.532
I have got to shut my
eyes for a few minutes,

14:32.533 --> 14:36.572
or I might accidentally
impose sanctions on Canada.

14:36.573 --> 14:38.282
(sighs)

14:38.283 --> 14:39.652
He's in my office, isn't he?

14:39.653 --> 14:42.112
I really have to work on
saying no to powerful people.

14:42.113 --> 14:44.282
I'm a powerful people pleaser.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.883
We all have things we
have to work on, Blake.

14:48.493 --> 14:51.152
Minister Chen!

14:51.153 --> 14:52.572
What a surprise.

14:52.573 --> 14:54.133
Madam Secretary.

14:55.073 --> 14:57.052
My government is gravely concerned

14:57.053 --> 14:59.092
about your incursion in Pakistan.

14:59.093 --> 15:03.052
Yes, I heard your president's blanket

15:03.053 --> 15:05.052
condemnation: "A scourge!

15:05.053 --> 15:07.512
A diabolical scourge on the region."

15:07.513 --> 15:09.342
I'm guessing that something

15:09.343 --> 15:11.922
got lost in translation,

15:11.923 --> 15:13.552
but you're here to clarify,

15:13.553 --> 15:14.632
aren't you?

15:14.633 --> 15:15.842
We do, indeed,

15:15.843 --> 15:18.512
condemn your hostile and destabilizing

15:18.513 --> 15:21.012
actions in the harshest possible terms.

15:21.013 --> 15:26.233
However, unofficially, I am
here to ask how China can help.

15:28.963 --> 15:33.462
Well, it... would have to
involve a time machine.

15:33.463 --> 15:35.962
You know we've been

15:35.963 --> 15:39.342
trying to bring China into
our Pakistan render safe plan

15:39.343 --> 15:40.842
for years now.

15:40.843 --> 15:44.222
You have an expression:
"Better late than never."

15:44.223 --> 15:46.012
I prefer, "Timing is everything."

15:46.013 --> 15:50.273
May I ask how the operation is going?

15:52.673 --> 15:58.342
We have secured the weapons
at 11 of their 12 bunkers.

15:58.343 --> 16:01.962
We're facing less resistance
as we go, probably because

16:01.963 --> 16:03.842
Abedi's grip on the
military is fracturing.

16:03.843 --> 16:06.302
This is our intelligence
assessment, as well.

16:06.303 --> 16:08.172
Great superpower minds...

16:08.173 --> 16:09.262
If all goes

16:09.263 --> 16:11.302
according to plan, we should be done

16:11.303 --> 16:12.962
within the hour.

16:12.963 --> 16:14.802
Well, if it doesn't,
we'll be taking you up

16:14.803 --> 16:15.802
on your offer to help,

16:15.803 --> 16:18.422
which is very much appreciated.

16:18.423 --> 16:21.462
Thank you, Elizabeth.

16:21.463 --> 16:23.443
You bet.

16:27.053 --> 16:30.382
(quietly, sighing):
Oh... my God. Oh, my God.

16:30.383 --> 16:32.613
Ma'am, you're needed
in the Situation Room.

16:36.883 --> 16:39.323
Sorry, still no word on Henry.

16:41.553 --> 16:42.552
Thanks, Blake.

16:42.553 --> 16:44.653
Mm-hmm.

16:48.223 --> 16:50.882
(indistinct conversations)

16:50.883 --> 16:53.172
JSOC team's landing at Petaro.

16:53.173 --> 16:56.012
Home of the last of
the Pakistani nukes.

16:56.013 --> 16:57.436
I have an update on Murphy Station.

16:57.437 --> 17:00.342
They're holed up in the
back room of a grocery store

17:00.343 --> 17:03.302
in the northeast quadrant
of the I-8 district.

17:03.303 --> 17:04.863
Our exfil unit is 20 minutes out.

17:06.223 --> 17:07.632
JSOC LEADER: Night Owl, someone got

17:07.633 --> 17:09.592
here before us.

17:09.593 --> 17:15.012
We have multiple Pakistani army
dead, security barriers smashed,

17:15.012 --> 17:18.092
and it looks like the cold
room has been breached.

17:18.093 --> 17:19.092
Copy.

17:19.093 --> 17:20.132
How about the heavy bags?

17:20.133 --> 17:22.193
Entering cold room.

17:26.512 --> 17:27.512
They're gone.

17:27.512 --> 17:30.592
The heavy bags are not here, sir.

17:30.593 --> 17:32.336
How many were supposed
to be there, Admiral?

17:32.337 --> 17:33.592
Six tactical nuclear warheads.

17:33.593 --> 17:35.012
So, they're small...

17:35.013 --> 17:37.592
and easily transportable.

17:37.593 --> 17:40.013
And very well may have fallen
into the hands of terrorists.

17:52.524 --> 17:54.023
Hizb Al-Shahid is now

17:54.024 --> 17:56.773
a caliphate armed with nuclear weapons.

17:56.774 --> 17:58.193
This is God's will.

17:58.194 --> 18:00.403
It is God's will to bring
the infidels to their knees

18:00.404 --> 18:02.153
and exterminate them.

18:02.154 --> 18:04.653
These nuclear bombs will
rain fire on your cities

18:04.654 --> 18:06.523
and bring death to millions.

18:06.524 --> 18:08.903
There is no refuge for the unbelievers.

18:08.904 --> 18:11.215
Those who do not turn
to the one, true God,

18:11.216 --> 18:12.634
will perish in flames.

18:12.635 --> 18:13.974
God is mer...

18:13.975 --> 18:14.974
Damn thing'll probably

18:14.975 --> 18:16.514
get more views than the kid

18:16.515 --> 18:18.844
biting his brother's finger.

18:18.845 --> 18:21.304
It was Hizb Al-Shahid's plan all along.

18:21.305 --> 18:24.054
Cozy up to the world's
most unstable nuclear power,

18:24.055 --> 18:25.884
foment chaos, then
steal their warheads.

18:25.885 --> 18:28.327
China offered their help earlier,

18:28.328 --> 18:31.157
so I've just reached
out to Minister Chen

18:31.158 --> 18:32.657
to seal their border.

18:32.658 --> 18:35.157
I'm also reaching out to Afghanistan,

18:35.158 --> 18:37.077
India, and even Iran

18:37.078 --> 18:38.997
to do the same. CENTCOM is scrambling

18:38.998 --> 18:40.747
to quarantine the Pakistani coast.

18:40.748 --> 18:43.447
Our entire military and
IC is focused on closing

18:43.448 --> 18:45.247
the circle on them, fast.

18:45.248 --> 18:50.287
And I'm having my staff
coordinate with ISN.

18:50.288 --> 18:53.617
See if they can game out HS's

18:53.618 --> 18:55.117
plans for the bombs.

18:55.118 --> 18:56.497
God help us if any of them

18:56.498 --> 18:58.928
make it out of Pakistan.

19:02.838 --> 19:04.497
My official statement is that

19:04.498 --> 19:06.445
I don't yet have an
official statement, Evan.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.655
Yeah, you bet that's a tautology,

19:08.656 --> 19:10.945
like you being up your own ass.

19:10.946 --> 19:13.216
(low, indistinct conversation)

19:16.246 --> 19:17.792
How's the official statement coming?

19:17.793 --> 19:20.372
Is it insensitive to say it
feels harder than render safe?

19:20.373 --> 19:21.621
Make sure it sounds like it is

19:21.622 --> 19:22.741
not a hostile takeover.

19:22.742 --> 19:24.541
Even though it kind of
is a hostile takeover?

19:24.542 --> 19:27.041
(sighs) A top-secret one with
the whole world watching.

19:27.042 --> 19:29.241
Oh, so, your classic non-denial denial.

19:29.242 --> 19:30.602
- More denial-denial.
- Wait, isn't

19:30.603 --> 19:31.906
denial-denial an acknowledgment?

19:31.907 --> 19:33.741
Without actually acknowledging.

19:33.742 --> 19:36.041
So, not lying, but not
really truthing either.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.241
And definitely nothing
about loose nukes.

19:38.242 --> 19:40.121
Even though there's a video.

19:40.122 --> 19:42.911
Okay, so, one deluxe denial-denial,

19:42.912 --> 19:44.707
hold the nukes, side of truth.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.029
Like that.

19:47.042 --> 19:48.749
So, if I'm Hizb Al-Shahid,

19:48.750 --> 19:50.499
where am I hiding those warheads?

19:50.500 --> 19:52.129
(chuckling): It's a big country, Jay.

19:52.130 --> 19:54.959
Yes, but this is Petaro,

19:54.960 --> 19:57.579
where the warheads were
taken about two hours ago,

19:57.580 --> 19:59.523
so they can't be more than
a couple hundred miles

19:59.524 --> 20:00.669
from there, meaning they are

20:00.670 --> 20:02.789
somewhere... in here.

20:02.790 --> 20:04.129
(chuckles)

20:04.130 --> 20:06.959
That's over 100,000 square miles.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.539
Okay.

20:09.540 --> 20:12.959
Uh, so, Karachi is a city
of about 24 million.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.459
A lot of other villages,
some desert, coast.

20:15.460 --> 20:18.539
Where in here would you want to
hide six tactical nuclear bombs?

20:18.540 --> 20:20.499
I have absolutely no idea,

20:20.500 --> 20:23.129
but I do know if these
terrorists have a bomb,

20:23.130 --> 20:24.499
they'll want to use it.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.669
Really, Walter? You think?

20:26.670 --> 20:28.079
I mean, I get that we're looking

20:28.080 --> 20:29.459
for a needle in a haystack,

20:29.460 --> 20:32.839
but I have this crazy suspicion
that pessimism, sarcasm

20:32.840 --> 20:34.339
and utter defeatism aren't gonna help

20:34.340 --> 20:36.043
stop the greatest
threat to our way of life

20:36.044 --> 20:37.169
we've ever encountered, so,

20:37.170 --> 20:39.339
if that's all you got, you should go...

20:39.340 --> 20:41.579
but I'm a father now, and if
these bombs make it here

20:41.580 --> 20:43.579
and, God forbid, they,
"rain fire on our cities

20:43.580 --> 20:45.999
and bring death to millions,"
I at least want to know that

20:46.000 --> 20:48.709
I did everything we could
to stop it, even when

20:48.710 --> 20:51.289
it was hard and seemed hopeless.

20:51.290 --> 20:54.209
That's very moving, Jay.

20:54.210 --> 20:56.579
But I repeat:

20:56.580 --> 21:00.209
If Hizb Al-Shahid
terrorists have a bomb,

21:00.210 --> 21:01.539
they'll want to use it,

21:01.540 --> 21:05.209
and that is an idea we
can actually work with.

21:05.210 --> 21:06.459
We can?

21:06.460 --> 21:08.789
Do you know how to
detonate a nuclear weapon?

21:08.790 --> 21:10.169
Now, there's...

21:10.170 --> 21:11.999
no red button, no plunger.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.879
They're not manufactured
by the ACME Corporation.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.169
Without authorization codes

21:18.170 --> 21:20.499
from the Pakistani Prime
Minister, you'll need

21:20.500 --> 21:24.579
to rewire the firing
set without activating

21:24.580 --> 21:26.039
the bomb's penalty system.

21:26.040 --> 21:30.289
You'll need to remove
the airburst fuse without

21:30.290 --> 21:35.709
exposing yourself to a lethal
dose of alpha radiation.

21:35.710 --> 21:40.209
Do you know how many people in
Pakistan can actually do that?

21:40.210 --> 21:41.249
No.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.419
Fourteen.

21:42.420 --> 21:46.789
There are only 14 nuclear scientists

21:46.790 --> 21:50.459
with the expertise to turn a
nuclear warhead into anything

21:50.460 --> 21:54.789
remotely useful to a non-state actor.

21:54.790 --> 21:58.999
So, if we can figure out if
one of these scientists is

21:59.000 --> 22:02.039
in cahoots with Hizb Al-Shahid,

22:02.040 --> 22:04.919
then we might be able to
track him to the bombs.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.709
Huh.

22:06.710 --> 22:10.289
I don't want my children to be vaporized

22:10.290 --> 22:13.770
any more than you want yours to, Jay.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.289
Our air force is prepared
to send aerial surveillance

22:17.290 --> 22:18.379
along the Afghan border.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.499
ELIZABETH: We'll take it.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.419
But it's the quarantine
of Pakistan's coast

22:22.420 --> 22:25.459
where we could really
use some quick backup.

22:25.460 --> 22:27.419
Our ships can only go so fast.

22:27.420 --> 22:29.249
I'll bring this to Li immediately.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.350
(two knocks on door)

22:31.250 --> 22:33.499
Russell Jackson would like a word.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.749
Thanks, Ming.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.669
I gotta go.

22:36.670 --> 22:38.169
Any idea what it's about?

22:38.170 --> 22:40.919
Uh, no, but I just heard
from Dean Ward's office,

22:40.920 --> 22:42.200
and there's been a slight hiccup

22:42.201 --> 22:43.424
with Alison's permission slip.

22:43.425 --> 22:44.629
How slight?

22:44.630 --> 22:46.879
Well, apparently, a student
recently managed to Photoshop

22:46.880 --> 22:49.289
his dad's signature
on a truancy notice,

22:49.290 --> 22:52.039
prompting Dean Ward
to change official policy,

22:52.040 --> 22:53.919
now requiring original
parent signatures

22:53.920 --> 22:54.959
on all student forms.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.129
I signed the form, Blake.

22:56.130 --> 22:58.249
I'm not hearing the hiccup.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.993
Turns out I was not aware
of the new policy,

22:59.994 --> 23:01.129
and I e-mailed it in.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.844
- Ah... - And now it's too late
to messenger the form over

23:03.845 --> 23:05.289
by the deadline at the
end of the school day,

23:05.290 --> 23:06.673
and I-I really... I am so sorry...

23:06.674 --> 23:08.579
All right. It's okay. It's okay.

23:08.580 --> 23:10.499
You just have to call Dean Ward.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.999
Tell her I am personally asking

23:13.000 --> 23:14.379
for an exception to this rule.

23:14.380 --> 23:16.669
I mean, I would do it, but, you know,

23:16.670 --> 23:18.499
things are so crazy around here,

23:18.500 --> 23:21.209
and given our history...

23:21.210 --> 23:24.419
I don't trust myself
to be polite, so...

23:24.420 --> 23:26.350
you have to do it.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.810
I will make the call, ma'am.

23:33.710 --> 23:36.339
I don't like the look of this.

23:36.340 --> 23:39.209
Murphy Station's exfil team got
bogged down in small arms fire

23:39.210 --> 23:41.039
as they rolled into Islamabad.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.339
Pakistani military?

23:42.340 --> 23:45.839
(sighs) Warring factions
in their ranks, apparently,

23:45.840 --> 23:49.539
or rioters, or God knows what else.

23:49.540 --> 23:50.480
So now what?

23:53.380 --> 23:55.039
Well, there's a, uh, cricket field

23:55.040 --> 23:58.129
two miles north of
Murphy's current location.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.709
We should be able to
put a chopper down.

23:59.710 --> 24:03.039
And the three of them are just
supposed to hoof it there?

24:03.040 --> 24:05.958
Parker thinks, if they
keep a low profile,

24:05.959 --> 24:07.822
they should be able to
get through the streets.

24:07.823 --> 24:08.977
With Jose bleeding out?

24:08.978 --> 24:11.890
Oh, my God. (sighs)

24:13.210 --> 24:14.669
We never should have let them stay.

24:14.670 --> 24:15.669
Elizabeth...

24:15.670 --> 24:16.919
No, no, you were right.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.379
No. I wasn't.

24:18.380 --> 24:21.499
Look, imagine how much
worse this would all be

24:21.500 --> 24:24.249
if Jibral Disah was still alive.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.039
Say what you want
about the evil bastard,

24:26.040 --> 24:28.669
he was a brilliant tactician.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.459
I like our odds of
finding those warheads

24:30.460 --> 24:33.940
a hell of a lot better with
him out of the picture.

24:36.340 --> 24:37.419
(groans)

24:37.420 --> 24:39.039
Okay, Jose.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.640
(distant gunfire popping)

24:42.420 --> 24:43.680
JOSE: Thanks.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.180
(distant gunfire continuing)

24:53.750 --> 24:55.140
Good?

24:57.130 --> 24:58.419
We gotta try to move.

24:58.420 --> 25:00.919
You think you can stand up, pal?

25:00.920 --> 25:02.339
Screw this.

25:02.340 --> 25:03.339
Let's go.

25:03.340 --> 25:04.680
Okay.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.629
FELLOWS: Okay.

25:07.630 --> 25:09.079
(Jose groaning)

25:09.080 --> 25:11.703
- HENRY: No, there's no way.
- FELLOWS: Yeah, just lean backwards.

25:11.704 --> 25:14.459
There you go.

25:14.460 --> 25:16.499
Well, we don't have a plan B.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.839
You guys go.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.749
Out of the question.
We're staying together.

25:20.750 --> 25:23.039
Marines crap.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.980
Jane, cancel the exfil.

25:28.170 --> 25:30.020
Ah, the phone's dead.

25:32.250 --> 25:34.129
Hey, Henry...

25:34.130 --> 25:36.020
Come on.

25:38.710 --> 25:41.339
Look, I think his lung's collapsing.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.600
We need to blow it back up.

25:43.710 --> 25:44.919
How do... how...

25:44.920 --> 25:46.129
Needle thoracostomy.

25:46.130 --> 25:48.339
It's basically a-a needle
with a valve on the end.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.512
You jam it into the lung,

25:49.513 --> 25:51.217
and it gives you relief
for a little while.

25:51.218 --> 25:52.289
You know how to do that?

25:52.290 --> 25:54.959
Well... field ops get
basic medical training.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.129
I could try.

25:56.130 --> 25:57.789
Uh, we need a chest compression needle.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.060
Any hospital should have one.

26:02.170 --> 26:03.499
Okay, I'll go.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.603
Wh... you really think you
can make it to a hospital?

26:05.604 --> 26:07.839
I don't know. It was your idea.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.709
Yeah, well, I'm just thinking out loud.

26:10.710 --> 26:11.750
Look, even if you made it,

26:11.751 --> 26:14.134
an American showing up at a
hospital when half the country's

26:14.135 --> 26:16.402
out there chanting "Death to America,"

26:16.403 --> 26:18.263
they'd string you up
to the nearest lamppost.

26:20.733 --> 26:22.942
Look, maybe I could
Jerry-rig a needle and valve

26:22.943 --> 26:25.203
with a pen or something.

26:27.483 --> 26:29.442
Maybe he could go.

26:29.443 --> 26:31.232
The guy we tied up to
a chair at gunpoint?

26:31.233 --> 26:32.852
Look, I gave him something to drink,

26:32.853 --> 26:34.236
he didn't spit it back in my face.

26:34.237 --> 26:36.232
He's seen Jose suffering,
maybe he has compassion.

26:36.233 --> 26:37.562
He'll know where a hospital is,

26:37.563 --> 26:39.546
and he's not going to get
strung up on a lamppost.

26:39.547 --> 26:42.062
From where I stand,
it checks off a lot of boxes.

26:42.063 --> 26:44.732
We'll need the guy with the
failing lung to translate.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.743
Let's not waste any time.

27:21.864 --> 27:23.984
I just heard from the DNI himself,

27:23.985 --> 27:26.943
about the last Pakistani
scientist... Sadozai.

27:26.944 --> 27:30.403
He's in Tehran... visiting family.

27:30.404 --> 27:32.073
WALTER: That's comforting.

27:32.074 --> 27:33.733
So much for your theory.

27:33.734 --> 27:35.523
No, it's not a theory, Jay.

27:35.524 --> 27:37.193
It may not be one of these men,

27:37.194 --> 27:40.363
but Hizb Al-Shahid has a competent hand

27:40.364 --> 27:42.693
tending to those warheads.

27:42.694 --> 27:45.642
Okay, so what other countries
with nuclear programs

27:45.643 --> 27:47.851
could they possibly have
recruited someone from?

27:47.852 --> 27:50.721
Uh, certainly not India.

27:50.722 --> 27:52.061
(typing rapidly) Russia?

27:52.062 --> 27:53.162
Mm-mm.

27:54.222 --> 27:55.391
Moldova?

27:55.392 --> 27:56.521
Hizb Al-Shahid

27:56.522 --> 27:58.981
bribed that Moldovan nuclear inspector

27:58.982 --> 28:00.662
to help steal uranium
for their dirty bomb.

28:00.663 --> 28:02.326
At the time,
you said that looking for him

28:02.327 --> 28:04.061
would be a dead end,
that we should focus

28:04.062 --> 28:05.542
on the end buyer, and you were right.

28:05.543 --> 28:06.807
Did you ever catch up with him?

28:06.808 --> 28:08.787
No. Last I heard,
we gave his name to Interpol.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.037
Here we go.

28:11.038 --> 28:12.957
Iancu Balan.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.657
Former chief nuclear inspector

28:14.658 --> 28:17.907
at the Rajlyan Power Plant in Tiraspol.

28:17.908 --> 28:21.287
He's already working
with Hizb Al-Shahid.

28:21.288 --> 28:25.157
Would he have the expertise
you're talking about?

28:25.158 --> 28:26.157
Yeah.

28:26.158 --> 28:28.657
I think he would.

28:28.658 --> 28:32.178
And I think I know how to find him.

28:33.248 --> 28:35.327
Iancu Balan?

28:35.328 --> 28:36.997
WALTER: He grew up in Moscow

28:36.998 --> 28:39.577
and was trained at the
Kurchatov Institute.

28:39.578 --> 28:41.407
We assume your government
sent him to Moldova.

28:41.408 --> 28:43.997
Of course, you weren't
counting on him going rogue.

28:43.998 --> 28:46.577
We know you keep close tabs
on your nuclear scientists.

28:46.578 --> 28:48.247
We want everything
you've got on this one.

28:48.248 --> 28:51.617
We might be willing
to share intelligence,

28:51.618 --> 28:53.867
if the price is right.

28:53.868 --> 28:57.697
Really? Um... actually,
can you guys, uh,

28:57.698 --> 29:00.758
give Minister Avdonin
and me the room... please?

29:07.458 --> 29:10.287
Do you remember the last time we spoke?

29:10.288 --> 29:12.787
You were telling me how
Abedi was going to ascend

29:12.788 --> 29:14.157
to the throne of Pakistan,

29:14.158 --> 29:16.457
and everything was going to be great?

29:16.458 --> 29:18.117
Yeah. We certainly overestimated

29:18.118 --> 29:19.787
Abedi's viability.

29:19.788 --> 29:21.211
Well, that's one way of putting it.

29:21.212 --> 29:22.287
Here's another:

29:22.288 --> 29:25.367
Your rainbow and unicorn
assessment of Abedi aside,

29:25.368 --> 29:27.287
you pulled out of render safe,

29:27.288 --> 29:30.287
and now Hizb Al-Shahid
has six nuclear weapons

29:30.288 --> 29:34.117
putting a significant
portion of humanity at risk.

29:34.118 --> 29:36.997
You want something from us,
Madam Secretary,

29:36.998 --> 29:39.657
I'd simply like something in return.

29:39.658 --> 29:41.907
Releasing Peter Buckley to us,

29:41.908 --> 29:42.868
for instance.

29:42.869 --> 29:43.928
Peter Buckley.

29:44.748 --> 29:47.367
One of the most notorious spies

29:47.368 --> 29:49.247
to ever sell U.S. secrets
to your government?

29:49.248 --> 29:51.157
Sure.

29:51.158 --> 29:55.037
We'll gladly ship him to Russia.

29:55.038 --> 29:56.537
In a box.

29:56.538 --> 29:58.848
But never while he's still breathing.

30:00.248 --> 30:03.138
I expect the dossier on
Balan within the hour.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.537
Okay. Let's get started.

30:28.538 --> 30:29.697
What did you find, Oliver?

30:29.698 --> 30:31.401
Iancu Balan was last
seen three months ago,

30:31.402 --> 30:34.287
leaving Rajlyan Power
Plant in Tiraspol.

30:34.288 --> 30:35.831
We all know about the uranium he stole

30:35.832 --> 30:37.457
and gave to Hizb Al-Shahid.

30:37.458 --> 30:40.037
But Russian GRU shared that he visited

30:40.038 --> 30:41.827
his brother in Moscow
eleven months ago.

30:41.828 --> 30:44.327
During that visit,
he was invited to meet

30:44.328 --> 30:46.311
with Russian officials at
his old stomping ground,

30:46.312 --> 30:47.697
the Kurchatov Institute.

30:47.698 --> 30:49.161
Russian agents took that opportunity

30:49.162 --> 30:51.617
to upload a privileged access
rootkit onto his laptop.

30:51.618 --> 30:53.197
And you can access it?

30:53.198 --> 30:54.367
I've turned it on remotely,

30:54.368 --> 30:56.190
and fired up its wireless router.

30:56.191 --> 30:58.310
If the power's down in Pakistan,

30:58.311 --> 30:59.719
how are you going to find it?

30:59.720 --> 31:03.059
He who shutteth down the grid
can selectively turn it back on.

31:03.060 --> 31:04.524
With your permission, Mr. President.

31:04.525 --> 31:07.092
Do whatever you need to.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.627
Ah, boom.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.849
Or, should I say, ping...

31:18.850 --> 31:20.530
uh, off a cell tower in Gadani.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.296
That's here, near the coast.

31:24.297 --> 31:27.386
They're trying to get
the bombs out by boat.

31:27.387 --> 31:29.676
Well, or maybe our naval quarantine

31:29.677 --> 31:31.926
with the Chinese is
making them reconsider.

31:31.927 --> 31:33.546
Can you give us parameters, Oliver?

31:33.547 --> 31:34.716
Yes, sir.

31:34.717 --> 31:36.926
I can narrow it down
to 12 square miles.

31:36.927 --> 31:39.096
I'll send the area directly to CENTCOM.

31:39.097 --> 31:41.836
Let's move every available
asset into that region.

31:41.837 --> 31:42.926
Yes, sir.

31:42.927 --> 31:44.777
Pray to God that we're not too late.

32:00.851 --> 32:02.510
FELLOWS: It's been too long.

32:02.511 --> 32:05.180
We have to start planning
for if he doesn't come back.

32:05.181 --> 32:08.010
If he doesn't come back, I'll go.

32:08.011 --> 32:09.281
Henry.

32:10.891 --> 32:12.010
Hey.

32:12.011 --> 32:13.510
We're getting you help.

32:13.511 --> 32:15.100
Yeah, sure.

32:15.101 --> 32:18.680
You and I both know that
shopkeeper's probably

32:18.681 --> 32:20.281
home shtooping his wife.

32:21.771 --> 32:23.140
Listen.

32:23.141 --> 32:24.930
I'm a lapsed Catholic.

32:24.931 --> 32:26.930
I know it's hard to believe.

32:26.931 --> 32:28.411
I'm sure the Almighty has seen worse.

32:28.412 --> 32:29.651
I haven't been to church since

32:29.652 --> 32:31.970
9/11.

32:31.971 --> 32:35.310
Got busy...

32:35.311 --> 32:36.720
and maybe a little pissed off.

32:36.721 --> 32:37.720
God can take it.

32:37.721 --> 32:40.821
I still want to hedge my bet.

32:44.141 --> 32:45.411
Give me my last rites, buddy.

32:48.181 --> 32:49.076
You're not dying.

32:49.077 --> 32:49.970
I know.

32:49.971 --> 32:52.411
I'm a model of good health.

32:53.931 --> 32:55.850
But just in case.

32:55.851 --> 32:58.470
Only a priest can give the
sacrament of last rites.

32:58.471 --> 33:02.060
Oh, come on, altar boy.

33:02.061 --> 33:05.161
Can you just perform
some prayer for the sick?

33:07.811 --> 33:09.970
Can you do that, please?

33:09.971 --> 33:13.991
It'll be enough for me to be at peace.

33:41.931 --> 33:43.270
Lord and Father, Almighty

33:43.271 --> 33:45.294
and Eternal God, by your
blessings give us strength

33:45.295 --> 33:47.180
and support in our frailty.

33:47.181 --> 33:49.640
Turn with kindness
toward this your servant.

33:49.641 --> 33:52.470
Free him from all illness and...

33:52.471 --> 33:54.430
um...

33:54.431 --> 33:57.411
free him from all illness and...

33:59.141 --> 34:01.220
(chuckles)

34:01.221 --> 34:02.571
Oh, hell...

34:04.851 --> 34:06.970
Are you sorry for your sins?

34:06.971 --> 34:09.139
Yeah.

34:09.141 --> 34:11.371
(crashing and thudding in distance)

34:16.141 --> 34:17.510
(speaking Urdu)

34:17.511 --> 34:18.326
What is he saying?

34:18.327 --> 34:19.139
Jose, ask who he is.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.241
He says you need doctor.

34:23.181 --> 34:24.451
You a doctor?

34:26.391 --> 34:27.871
Yeah. Come on.

34:29.541 --> 34:31.050
_

34:31.422 --> 34:33.197
_

34:33.902 --> 34:34.840
_

34:38.685 --> 34:39.664
_

34:41.034 --> 34:42.246
_

34:54.554 --> 34:56.186
_

35:02.851 --> 35:05.180
(men shouting in Arabic)

35:05.181 --> 35:07.680
(gunfire)

35:07.681 --> 35:08.890
SOLDIER: <i>Target neutralized.</i>

35:08.891 --> 35:11.611
<i>Moving to secure warheads.</i>

35:24.271 --> 35:25.640
Hey, hey.

35:25.641 --> 35:27.060
What? Oh.

35:27.061 --> 35:28.560
We got the nukes. All six of them.

35:28.561 --> 35:29.560
What about...?

35:29.561 --> 35:30.720
The SEAL team will reach

35:30.721 --> 35:32.704
Murphy Station's rendezvous
point in five minutes.

35:32.705 --> 35:35.725
Okay, okay.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.640
COMMANDER: Spartan Six
landing at rendezvous point.

35:40.641 --> 35:41.640
PARKER: Copy, Spartan.

35:41.641 --> 35:43.270
Any sign of Murphy Station?

35:43.271 --> 35:44.890
Over.

35:44.891 --> 35:47.951
Negative, Night Owl.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.623
- Shots fired!
- (gunfire over video)

35:50.624 --> 35:51.661
(soldiers shouting)

35:51.662 --> 35:52.951
Damn it.

35:58.011 --> 35:59.470
We're good.

35:59.471 --> 36:01.220
Gunfire nearby, not directed at us.

36:01.221 --> 36:02.430
Copy.

36:02.431 --> 36:04.331
They'll wait ten minutes,
then pull up stakes.

36:06.851 --> 36:08.754
COMMANDER: There's
movement about 60 yards away.

36:08.755 --> 36:09.430
Approaching.

36:09.431 --> 36:10.470
PARKER: Can you confirm

36:10.471 --> 36:11.600
it's Murphy Station?

36:11.601 --> 36:12.701
Over.

36:17.141 --> 36:18.720
Affirmative, Night Owl.

36:18.721 --> 36:20.930
We have eyes on
Murphy Station. Full set.

36:20.931 --> 36:22.871
Making contact, preparing for extract.

36:35.101 --> 36:36.201
Got them.

36:37.971 --> 36:40.970
Congratulations, Murphy
Station, on a job well done.

36:40.971 --> 36:42.430
Thank you, Mr. President.

36:42.431 --> 36:45.100
I'm here with the Secretary of State

36:45.101 --> 36:47.270
and the rest of the NSC.

36:47.271 --> 36:49.054
We're all looking forward
to you coming home.

36:49.055 --> 36:51.100
Thank you, sir.

36:51.101 --> 36:53.970
I think I'm gonna take
some of my vacation days.

36:53.971 --> 36:55.770
I look forward

36:55.771 --> 36:57.821
to being a couch potato for a while.

36:59.141 --> 37:00.951
DALTON: Well deserved, Henry.

37:02.471 --> 37:04.060
I should address the nation.

37:04.061 --> 37:05.140
Well, it never gets old.

37:05.141 --> 37:06.770
I'll set it up.

37:06.771 --> 37:09.810
Uh, tell Henry I'll buy him
a drink when he gets back.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.470
Well, I think you can buy me one, too.

37:12.471 --> 37:13.770
Blake.

37:13.771 --> 37:14.521
ELIZABETH: Hey.

37:14.522 --> 37:15.270
Sir.

37:15.271 --> 37:16.510
Listen, will you, uh,

37:16.511 --> 37:18.720
find out if Minister
Avdonin is still in town?

37:18.721 --> 37:19.556
Okay?

37:19.557 --> 37:20.491
Of course.

37:21.431 --> 37:23.350
What?

37:23.351 --> 37:25.814
Ma'am, I did everything I could
to get Dean Ward on the phone,

37:25.815 --> 37:27.430
and when I say everything, I mean...

37:27.431 --> 37:29.054
Short of sending a
special envoy, got it.

37:29.055 --> 37:32.640
Yes, uh, finally, her assistant,
Marigold, got back to me.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.680
She said it was a settled issue.

37:35.681 --> 37:37.890
She said that?

37:37.891 --> 37:39.470
"Settled issue"?

37:39.471 --> 37:40.560
Those exact words.

37:40.561 --> 37:42.064
They're playing on a loop in my head.

37:42.065 --> 37:43.260
Put a pin in Minister Avdonin

37:43.261 --> 37:44.310
and find me Dean Ward.

37:44.311 --> 37:45.310
Get her on the phone?

37:45.311 --> 37:48.350
No, find out where she is.

37:48.351 --> 37:49.951
Right now?

37:52.641 --> 37:54.930
ELIZABETH: Dean Ward,
what a coincidence.

37:54.931 --> 37:56.310
Madam Secretary.

37:56.311 --> 37:57.810
I didn't know you went here.

37:57.811 --> 37:59.220
I don't. That was a joke.

37:59.221 --> 38:01.600
I was hoping to talk to you about

38:01.601 --> 38:03.100
the 11th grade field trip.

38:03.101 --> 38:04.421
I believe my assistant, Marigold,

38:04.422 --> 38:05.885
- spoke to your assistant.
- I heard.

38:05.886 --> 38:07.271
- "Settled issue."
- That's right.

38:07.272 --> 38:08.430
Here's the thing.

38:08.431 --> 38:10.930
Alison really has her
heart set on this trip,

38:10.931 --> 38:12.590
and, well, she shouldn't be left behind

38:12.591 --> 38:13.880
just because I messed up.

38:13.881 --> 38:15.683
- Madam Secretary...
- No, please, just let me

38:15.684 --> 38:17.300
say my piece.

38:17.301 --> 38:21.140
Now I don't know if you noticed,
but it's been pretty hectic

38:21.141 --> 38:23.300
the last couple of days
in the world, and, well,

38:23.301 --> 38:25.140
I haven't focused too much on my kids,

38:25.141 --> 38:27.590
which I promised wouldn't
happen when I took this job,

38:27.591 --> 38:28.734
but who am I kidding, right?

38:28.735 --> 38:30.590
But not being present for them

38:30.591 --> 38:32.930
is different than
completely letting them down,

38:32.931 --> 38:35.590
so I-I-I'm throwing myself
at your mercy here.

38:35.591 --> 38:38.720
When my assistant said
it was a settled issue,

38:38.721 --> 38:39.741
Madam Secretary...

38:39.742 --> 38:40.760
Really?

38:40.761 --> 38:42.224
You're sticking with "settled issue"?

38:42.225 --> 38:44.340
Fine, what's it gonna take
to get Alison on that bus?

38:44.341 --> 38:45.764
You want dinner with the president?

38:45.765 --> 38:47.510
I don't know, Air Force
One more your thing?

38:47.511 --> 38:48.880
What are we talking about here?

38:48.881 --> 38:50.800
'Cause I got to tell you, I have
dealt with brutal dictators

38:50.801 --> 38:52.970
that were more flexible,
and, frankly, just a little

38:52.971 --> 38:54.340
bit more likable than you.

38:54.341 --> 38:55.380
Are you finished?

38:55.381 --> 38:57.260
Depends on your answer.

38:57.261 --> 39:01.800
When I told my assistant Marigold

39:01.801 --> 39:05.470
to tell your assistant
that it was a settled issue

39:05.471 --> 39:09.010
it was because Alison had come
to my office and very politely

39:09.011 --> 39:12.800
and respectfully requested
an extra day to turn in

39:12.801 --> 39:15.470
her signed permission slip,
which I granted.

39:15.471 --> 39:17.880
Really?

39:17.881 --> 39:19.470
Making it a settled...

39:19.471 --> 39:21.300
BOTH: ...issue.

39:21.301 --> 39:24.260
Good evening, Secretary McCord.

39:24.261 --> 39:25.430
Do you need a chaperone?

39:25.431 --> 39:26.550
No, thank you.

39:26.551 --> 39:28.430
If you need any help
getting in somewhere...

39:28.431 --> 39:31.180
No, we're fine.

39:31.181 --> 39:33.611
It was nice to see you.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.510
DALTON: <i>Jibral Disah</i>

39:41.511 --> 39:44.640
will no longer be able to
attack the United States.

39:44.641 --> 39:47.180
The swift justice Hizb
Al-Shahid's leader met

39:47.181 --> 39:49.880
sends a clear message to
what's left of his terrorist

39:49.881 --> 39:52.970
organization and anyone else
who would seek to do us harm.

39:52.971 --> 39:57.340
Wherever you're hiding,
we will find you.

39:57.341 --> 39:58.680
Minister Avdonin.

39:58.681 --> 39:59.840
Thanks for coming out.

39:59.841 --> 40:03.111
How could I say no to toasting success?

40:04.801 --> 40:08.140
Listen, I know things
got heated in my office,

40:08.141 --> 40:11.640
but it's the end result that matters.

40:11.641 --> 40:14.800
GRU's Intel was vital to

40:14.801 --> 40:17.300
finding the last of the bombs.

40:17.301 --> 40:18.930
Can I get you anything,
Madam Secretary?

40:18.931 --> 40:21.380
Single malt, neat. Thanks.

40:21.381 --> 40:23.760
I have two boys and a little girl.

40:23.761 --> 40:26.970
I'll sleep better because
of all of our efforts.

40:26.971 --> 40:31.800
Boy, can I ever appreciate that.

40:31.801 --> 40:32.656
Cheers.

40:32.657 --> 40:33.611
<i>Na Zdorovie.</i>

40:37.721 --> 40:40.880
And I appreciate the
renewed good will between us,

40:40.881 --> 40:43.531
especially given I'm about
to ask you for a favor.

40:47.181 --> 40:50.590
There's a young, Russian
woman in prison, in Moscow,

40:50.591 --> 40:53.140
on a hooliganism charge.

40:53.141 --> 40:54.470
I'd like to see her released.

40:54.471 --> 40:56.590
Talia Petrova.

40:56.591 --> 41:00.010
What does the United States have
to gain by freeing this girl?

41:00.011 --> 41:02.720
It's a matter of...

41:02.721 --> 41:04.300
personal significance.

41:04.301 --> 41:09.090
Maybe now you will consider
a trade for Peter Buckley.

41:09.091 --> 41:11.090
(laughs)

41:11.091 --> 41:12.930
Okay.

41:12.931 --> 41:18.090
You're a good soldier
for your president...

41:18.091 --> 41:20.260
but Talia Petrova is an innocent girl

41:20.261 --> 41:22.380
and Peter Buckley is a high value spy.

41:22.381 --> 41:23.531
Come on, Konstantin.

41:25.221 --> 41:27.590
Then perhaps we can sweeten the deal

41:27.591 --> 41:30.590
with the release of an American spy.

41:30.591 --> 41:33.691
Are you interested in Talia's brother?

41:36.681 --> 41:38.300
Dmitri Petrov?

41:38.301 --> 41:39.550
Mm-hmm.

41:39.551 --> 41:40.970
He's dead.

41:40.971 --> 41:43.651
What if he isn't?

41:45.971 --> 41:53.641
