♪ We got the power

00:20.641 --> 00:23.437

Glug, glug,
glug, glug, glug.

00:33.481 --> 00:36.657
I'm so glad you could
join us for tea, Mr. Dog.

00:38.141 --> 00:41.696
Oh, I'm sorry,
DoctorDog.

00:41.731 --> 00:44.182
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

00:44.216 --> 00:46.115
Yeesh!
I said I was sorry!

00:48.013 --> 00:50.222
Buttercup,
I've had it with you!

00:50.257 --> 00:52.914
No!
I've had it with you!

00:52.949 --> 00:54.261
Hey, girls.

00:54.295 --> 00:56.194
What's crack-a-lackin'?

00:58.679 --> 01:00.094
Ahh! Ugh!
Oof.

01:00.129 --> 01:02.821
Huh! Ugh!
Oof!

01:02.855 --> 01:04.271
Stop!

01:04.305 --> 01:06.066
Why are you fighting?

01:06.100 --> 01:09.793
Blossom destroyed the only
thing I love in this world.

01:11.416 --> 01:13.142
That pile of trash?

01:13.176 --> 01:14.798
That's not trash.

01:14.833 --> 01:18.078
That's my Space Tow Truck Series
One Malibu Mayhem Racer.

01:18.112 --> 01:21.322
Do you even know how much that
goes for on the black market?

01:21.357 --> 01:24.670
Buttercup left her toy in
the middle of the floor again,

01:24.705 --> 01:28.157
so in the spirit of not
living in a pigsty,

01:28.191 --> 01:30.262
I moved it
to behind the door.

01:30.297 --> 01:32.437
Well,
that makes sense to me.

01:32.471 --> 01:37.683
Behind the very door I use
for my dramatic entrances.

01:37.718 --> 01:39.858
Buttercup in da house!

01:39.892 --> 01:41.031
Booyah!

01:41.066 --> 01:43.275
Crimbly bimbly.

01:43.310 --> 01:46.416
Hot dog, cold cat.

01:46.451 --> 01:49.039
Bubbles, tell her she doesn't
have to slam the door open

01:49.074 --> 01:50.420
every time she comes in.

01:50.455 --> 01:51.939
Technically, that's true,
and, well...

01:51.973 --> 01:54.804
Who died and made
Blossom queen of doors?

01:54.838 --> 01:56.185
I'm not sure.

01:56.219 --> 01:58.842
You need to learn
some responsibility, Buttercup.

01:58.877 --> 02:02.052
You need to leave
my stuff alone, Blossom.

02:02.087 --> 02:03.709
Right, Bubbles?Right, Bubbles?

02:04.917 --> 02:06.712
Bubbles is on myside!

02:06.747 --> 02:09.543
No,
Bubbles is on myside!

02:09.577 --> 02:11.890
I don't want
to take sides!

02:14.341 --> 02:17.551
Professor, Blossom and Buttercup
are angry at each other.

02:17.585 --> 02:20.312
I'm usually great
at cheering people up,

02:20.347 --> 02:22.072
but I don't know
what to do now.

02:22.107 --> 02:24.178
Oh, Bubbles,
it's quite simple.

02:24.213 --> 02:26.974
All you have to do
is...

02:27.008 --> 02:29.356
give up.

02:29.390 --> 02:31.220
Hmm. That is simple,

02:31.254 --> 02:33.083
but I think I'm gonna
try to get some advice

02:33.118 --> 02:35.085
that's not so give-up-y.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.295
Suit yourself.

02:40.436 --> 02:42.300
Hey, Barry.
Yo, Bubbles.

02:42.334 --> 02:44.336
What's up?I need some help.

02:44.371 --> 02:46.752
Well, you came
to the right place

02:46.787 --> 02:48.237
because I'm...

02:48.271 --> 02:52.172
a loser
with dumb ideas.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.485
Um...okay.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.350
Mrs. Rhonda, my favorite
marine biologist,

02:58.385 --> 02:59.593
I need some advice.

02:59.627 --> 03:02.182
Why, Bubbles,
of course...

03:02.216 --> 03:03.493
not.

03:03.528 --> 03:06.565
I can't even help myself.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.533
Uhh...

03:08.567 --> 03:11.294
What is up
with everyone today?

03:12.813 --> 03:13.779
Oh, Bubbles.

03:13.814 --> 03:17.127
Today is
the saddest day ever.

03:17.162 --> 03:19.544
I just found out
I'm bald.

03:19.578 --> 03:22.098
Well, you've always
been bald, Mr. Mayor.

03:22.132 --> 03:23.789
So you knew?

03:23.824 --> 03:27.966
Now I'm even more sad than
when that rain cloud appeared.

03:29.795 --> 03:33.592
A mysterious rain cloud
that's making everyone sad?

03:33.627 --> 03:36.457
Hmm. This sounds like
the perfect adventure

03:36.492 --> 03:39.529
to get the Powerpuff Girls
back together.

03:39.564 --> 03:42.946
All it'll take is
some Bubbles charm.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.433
Hello?What's up, girlfriend?

03:46.467 --> 03:48.642
Sorry, Bubbles.
I can't talk right now.

03:48.676 --> 03:51.300
I'm trying to get this animal
out of our room

03:51.334 --> 03:54.303
and back into the jungle
where she belongs!

03:54.337 --> 03:56.270
I'm not an animal!

03:57.685 --> 04:00.723
Yeesh!
Guess I'm on my own.

04:00.757 --> 04:01.551
Bye-bye.

04:01.586 --> 04:05.175
I'll be here wasting away.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.393
Whoa. What is this place?

04:21.295 --> 04:23.193
Hello, there.
My name is Bubbles.

04:23.228 --> 04:24.298
What's yours?

04:24.333 --> 04:26.093
My name is Largo,

04:26.127 --> 04:28.440
as in, "Go away, Largo.

04:28.475 --> 04:30.200
You're too sad."

04:30.235 --> 04:33.583
Aw. Why are you
such a sad bear?

04:33.618 --> 04:36.310
I wasn't always
a sad bear.

04:36.345 --> 04:38.554
I used to be happy.

04:40.003 --> 04:45.008
That's me, just an
ordinary cosmic bear.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.321
Ah!

04:47.356 --> 04:50.704
It sure is
a beautiful day.

04:50.738 --> 04:53.223
-Hi, there.
-Hey, Mrs. Cat.

04:53.258 --> 04:54.501
What's up, dude?

04:54.535 --> 04:56.468
Nada mucho,Ardy.

04:56.503 --> 04:58.470
Oh, you better get inside.

04:58.505 --> 05:00.230
There's a cosmic storm
coming.

05:00.265 --> 05:03.199
Just getting the mail,
Dr. Lobster.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.719
Glenda,
what you got for me?

05:06.927 --> 05:09.964
I love getting mail
from friends.

05:09.999 --> 05:14.244
That's when I got struck
by cosmic lightning.

05:19.008 --> 05:22.736
We were separated into
two different bears.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.738
I'm Largo.

05:24.772 --> 05:26.912
I'm Allegro.

05:26.947 --> 05:28.742
We tried to get along,

05:28.776 --> 05:32.193
but we were just
too different.

05:32.228 --> 05:36.266
He liked to party
and have fun,

05:36.301 --> 05:40.581
but I was...just sad.

05:42.756 --> 05:44.344
That's it!

05:44.378 --> 05:45.931
I'm out of here.

05:45.966 --> 05:49.245
You're the saddest bear
I've ever seen.

05:49.279 --> 05:53.491
And we haven't spoken
since.

05:54.526 --> 05:57.357
Aw. That's awful,

05:57.391 --> 05:58.599
but don't worry.

05:58.634 --> 06:02.879
I'll turn that frown
upside down all over town.

06:02.914 --> 06:05.019
I don't think so.

06:07.539 --> 06:10.059
Hello?
Bubbles, great news!

06:10.093 --> 06:11.612
Blossom is moving out.

06:11.647 --> 06:13.614
I need you to help me
take her stuff to the Dumpster.

06:13.649 --> 06:15.409
What?

06:15.444 --> 06:17.031
Hold, please.

06:17.066 --> 06:19.965
Bubbles, Buttercup is trying to
throw my stuff in the Dumpster,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.415
but joke's on her.

06:21.450 --> 06:23.244
I already threw her stuff
in the Dumpster!

06:23.279 --> 06:24.453
Oh, no.

06:24.487 --> 06:26.455
Hold, please.

06:26.489 --> 06:28.698
Hi, Bubbles.
We gave a lot of thought

06:28.733 --> 06:30.873
to what you said
about cheering up.

06:30.907 --> 06:31.943
That's great.

06:31.977 --> 06:35.395
So we all just voted
to blow up the town

06:35.429 --> 06:38.328
after we take
a sad nap, of course.

06:38.363 --> 06:40.814
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no! Wait!

06:40.848 --> 06:44.783
Largo, you've got to get happy
before Townsville blows up.

06:44.818 --> 06:45.991
No can do.

06:46.026 --> 06:50.582
I haven't been happy
since I split up with Allegro.

06:50.617 --> 06:52.998
Oh, no!
You're sad,

06:53.033 --> 06:55.449
Blossom and Buttercup
hate each other's guts,

06:55.484 --> 06:58.072
and Townsville is going
to explode any minute!

06:58.107 --> 07:00.627
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

07:00.661 --> 07:03.906
I've got it!

07:03.940 --> 07:06.149
Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.
Tea time!

07:06.184 --> 07:09.601
After all, you can't spell
friendship without "T."

07:09.636 --> 07:11.948
Yes! Yes, you can!

07:11.983 --> 07:13.674
There's no "T"
in friendship.

07:13.709 --> 07:15.849
Why do you have to correct
people all the time?

07:15.883 --> 07:17.471
Why do you have
to be such a slob?

07:17.506 --> 07:20.370
Why do you have
to be such a dorkis?

07:20.405 --> 07:22.649
Hey, let's change
the subject.

07:22.683 --> 07:25.479
I want you to meet
my new friend.

07:25.514 --> 07:29.518
My name is Largo,
as in, "Hey, Largo."

07:29.552 --> 07:32.313
Don't care.
Fair enough.

07:32.348 --> 07:34.039
Huh?

07:34.074 --> 07:37.733
Oh, our last guest
has arrived.

07:39.562 --> 07:41.391
Let's party!

07:41.426 --> 07:42.807
♪ Zut zut zut alors

07:59.686 --> 08:01.860
Oh. Oh, I can't.
Nuh-uh.

08:01.895 --> 08:05.070
I'm not gonna sit here
with that sad sack.

08:06.347 --> 08:07.866
Now, now, everybody.

08:07.901 --> 08:10.869
Townsville can't handle
all of us fighting each other,

08:10.904 --> 08:14.079
so we're just gonna
sit back, drink some tea,

08:14.114 --> 08:17.531
and remember how much
we all love each other.

08:22.122 --> 08:24.055
Ding!
The crumpets are ready.

08:24.089 --> 08:27.230
Now, don't have too much fun
while I'm gone.

08:27.265 --> 08:30.199
Those better not be
imaginary crumpets.

08:30.233 --> 08:33.684
Oh, boy! The crumpets
look perfect.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.583
Everything is going
so well.

08:35.618 --> 08:37.551
Ooh, hot, hot, hot!

08:37.586 --> 08:38.828
Don't worry, Professor.

08:38.863 --> 08:40.830
Soon, everyone's gonna
be marshmallows

08:40.865 --> 08:43.557
and graham crackers
again.

08:43.592 --> 08:45.594
We're all doomed.

08:45.628 --> 08:48.389
Okay. Who wants
the first crumpet?

08:51.807 --> 08:53.187
Hi-yah!
Aah!

08:58.503 --> 09:01.195
Ooh! Ooh!

09:01.230 --> 09:02.576
Ooh!

09:02.611 --> 09:04.474
Enough!

09:05.786 --> 09:07.857
Ah! Oof! Ah! Oof!

09:07.892 --> 09:08.962
Aah! Oof!

09:08.996 --> 09:09.963
Aah! Oof!

09:09.997 --> 09:12.137
You just want to fight,
huh?

09:12.172 --> 09:15.313
I listened to each of you
whine and complain.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.694
"Bubbles, she did it."

09:16.728 --> 09:18.868
"Bubbles, tell her
to apologize."

09:18.903 --> 09:20.594
"Bubbles, Bubbles,
Bubbles!"

09:20.629 --> 09:23.321
Allegro never complained
to you about...

09:23.355 --> 09:25.634
I wasn't finished yet!

09:25.668 --> 09:28.602
Now, we're going to
have a tea party,

09:28.637 --> 09:31.225
and we're going to
have a nice time

09:31.260 --> 09:33.607
because you're all
going to apologize

09:33.642 --> 09:35.747
to each other right now,

09:35.782 --> 09:39.095
or do I have
to get mad?

09:39.855 --> 09:41.995
Oh, all right. Sorry.Sorry. Whatever, I guess.

09:42.029 --> 09:45.136
Sorry.I can't hear you!

09:47.656 --> 09:50.175
Good. Now, hug.

09:51.211 --> 09:54.076
Uh.
Ah.

09:54.110 --> 09:55.146
Ah. Ah.

09:55.180 --> 09:55.940
I'm not a big hugger.

09:55.974 --> 09:59.668
I said hug!

10:01.221 --> 10:03.430
She's not messing around,
dudes.

10:07.296 --> 10:08.366
Ah. Ah.

10:14.061 --> 10:15.097
Ah!

10:15.131 --> 10:19.549
It's good to be
a cosmic bear again!

10:19.584 --> 10:23.036
Thanks, Bubbles!

10:23.070 --> 10:26.108
Hot diggity dog!
I feel great.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.489
Barry is back, baby!

10:28.524 --> 10:30.146
What was I thinking?

10:30.181 --> 10:31.700
I'm not bald.

10:33.702 --> 10:35.565
Ooh, what a relief.

10:37.188 --> 10:39.397
Sorry for putting
your toy behind the door.

10:39.431 --> 10:44.195
Well, I'm kind of sorry
for being a little messy.

10:44.229 --> 10:46.956
Yay! Everything's
back to normal.

10:46.991 --> 10:49.683
It's time to celebrate...

10:49.718 --> 10:51.685
with crumpets!

10:51.720 --> 10:53.963
Oh, geez.

10:53.998 --> 10:56.794
Ugh, those are not real,
dude.

10:56.828 --> 10:58.071
Eat the crumpets!

10:58.105 --> 10:59.486
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.Oh, of course. Mm.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.213
Mm, good one.
