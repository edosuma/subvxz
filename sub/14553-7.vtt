01:16.832 --> 01:17.670
Hey, what's up?

01:17.790 --> 01:19.822
You didn't open that on
the kitchen table, did you?

01:19.935 --> 01:21.084
Nope.

01:21.204 --> 01:23.103
Are you lying?
Yep.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.211
Why do you do that?

01:26.324 --> 01:27.924
The opener's
right in the drawer.

01:28.037 --> 01:30.060
Yeah, well, the table's
right here.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.296
Louie!

01:32.409 --> 01:33.776
I love you.

01:41.050 --> 01:42.505
Why would you say that?

01:42.618 --> 01:44.241
What?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.076
I mean, I just said
a really dick thing.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.347
Why-- why would you
say, "I love you"?

01:49.460 --> 01:50.815
What am I supposed to do here?

01:50.928 --> 01:52.483
- Please?
- Cut!

01:52.596 --> 01:53.985
What's wrong, buddy?

01:54.098 --> 01:56.121
I just...

01:56.234 --> 01:57.623
Why does she say that?

01:57.736 --> 01:59.491
It's cute.

01:59.604 --> 02:01.360
It's cute?
Yeah.

02:01.473 --> 02:02.862
Dude...

02:02.975 --> 02:04.363
I thought we were gonna
do a show about marriage,

02:04.476 --> 02:06.032
like a really honest,
real show.

02:06.145 --> 02:07.366
Yeah.
So what--

02:07.479 --> 02:09.201
This woman is trying to
raise two kids

02:09.314 --> 02:11.537
and her husband just
keeps shittin' all over her,

02:11.650 --> 02:12.971
chipping away at all
the furniture

02:13.084 --> 02:14.439
with his bad attitude.
Yeah.

02:14.552 --> 02:16.687
I mean, are you folks
seriously buying this shit?

02:20.124 --> 02:21.312
Louie, the show's
gonna be great.

02:21.425 --> 02:22.714
No, it's not!
Yeah.

02:22.827 --> 02:25.283
No, man, it's gonna suck, like
every show on television.

02:25.396 --> 02:26.885
We're making
all the same mistakes.

02:26.998 --> 02:29.354
The wife that's way too hot
for the dude

02:29.467 --> 02:32.125
and the friend who
I would never hang out with.

02:32.238 --> 02:33.926
Bob, I love you, you're great,

02:34.039 --> 02:35.695
but there's no reason
for you to be on this show.

02:35.808 --> 02:36.863
I mean, honestly, no offense.

02:36.976 --> 02:38.198
None taken.

02:38.311 --> 02:39.366
You know what?

02:39.479 --> 02:40.901
Can you guys figure
this shit out, okay?

02:41.527 --> 02:44.932
This is my last go-around, all right?
I am 38 years old.

02:45.052 --> 02:46.908
I hitched to this horse

02:47.021 --> 02:48.610
- because you guys said you
wanted to get on air. - Yeah.

02:48.723 --> 02:49.878
In another couple of years,

02:49.991 --> 02:51.413
these fake tits
are gonna look stupid.

02:51.526 --> 02:53.882
So if I'm wasting my time here,
you need to tell me now.

02:53.995 --> 02:55.283
You're wasting your time, you are.
Great!

02:55.396 --> 02:57.219
No, no, Jennifer,
this is gonna be fine.

02:57.332 --> 02:58.954
It-- we can't have a show
where everybody

02:59.067 --> 03:01.190
just says whatever
'cause it's cute.

03:01.303 --> 03:02.458
Boo!

03:02.571 --> 03:04.037
Oh, you know what,
( bleep ) you people!

03:04.150 --> 03:05.150
Okay, okay, look..

03:05.263 --> 03:06.897
What do you want her
to say to you?

03:07.010 --> 03:08.065
What do I want her to say?
Yeah!

03:08.178 --> 03:09.366
You say the table is right here

03:09.479 --> 03:11.135
and then what does she say?

03:11.248 --> 03:12.503
"I'm leaving you."

03:12.616 --> 03:13.764
That's not funny.

03:13.877 --> 03:14.878
Yes, it is.

03:14.991 --> 03:16.507
That's hilarious.

03:16.620 --> 03:17.742
Come on.

03:17.855 --> 03:19.176
"The opener's right there."

03:19.289 --> 03:20.978
"Yeah, but the table's
right here."

03:21.091 --> 03:22.413
"I'm leaving you."

03:22.526 --> 03:23.948
And then she leaves!

03:24.061 --> 03:25.383
And she takes the kids
and then this dude

03:25.496 --> 03:27.018
has to finally face himself

03:27.131 --> 03:29.087
because she's gone
and there's nobody else

03:29.200 --> 03:31.222
to be an asshole to
but himself.

03:31.335 --> 03:33.424
Don't you wanna do--
don't you wanna do that show?

03:33.537 --> 03:36.360
Wouldn't you love
to do that show?

03:36.473 --> 03:38.129
Is everything okay at home,
Louie?

03:38.242 --> 03:39.730
Oh, Christ.

03:39.843 --> 03:41.565
No!

03:41.678 --> 03:43.278
All right, let's take a break.

04:11.642 --> 04:12.764
Oh, hi.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.699
Oh, okay.

04:14.812 --> 04:15.945
Okay, all right.

04:19.616 --> 04:21.917
Hey... hey.

04:26.423 --> 04:28.713
Oh, baby.

04:28.826 --> 04:31.850
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

04:31.963 --> 04:35.287
Your dad's not gonna have
a sitcom.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.622
Not gonna do it.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.391
I wanted to.

04:38.504 --> 04:41.261
I wanted to, so I wouldn't have
to be on the road all the time,

04:41.374 --> 04:44.632
away from you...

04:44.745 --> 04:46.266
and I just wouldnât do it.

04:46.379 --> 04:47.579
Maybe I'm a coward.

04:49.182 --> 04:51.538
Sorry, baby.

04:51.651 --> 04:54.040
Your dad is a comedian.

04:54.153 --> 04:56.163
It's your tough luck.

04:56.647 --> 04:58.122
All right,
let's put you to sleep.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.614
♪ I had me a rooster ♪

05:02.727 --> 05:05.383
♪ The rooster pleased me ♪

05:05.496 --> 05:10.022
♪ I fed my rooster to
the green berry tree ♪

05:10.135 --> 05:12.592
♪ Little rooster says... ♪

05:12.705 --> 05:14.494
Lilly...

05:14.607 --> 05:15.640
Lilly, I love you.

05:17.315 --> 05:18.865
Please put your hands together

05:18.978 --> 05:22.181
and make that loud clapping
sound for Louie C.K.!

05:34.161 --> 05:36.217
Thank you very much.

05:36.330 --> 05:37.652
Thank you, everybody.

05:37.765 --> 05:41.823
Uh, I have some notes
I'm gonna be working off of.

05:41.936 --> 05:43.269
I hope that's okay with you.

05:45.138 --> 05:48.261
I've never stopped anything
so cold in all my life.

05:48.374 --> 05:49.630
That was amazing.

05:49.743 --> 05:52.833
You guys were clapping so much

05:52.946 --> 05:57.137
and now you look like you've
never clapped in your lives.

05:57.250 --> 06:01.808
That applause is so far in
the rear-view mirror right now.

06:01.921 --> 06:05.245
That's amazing
how quickly--

06:05.358 --> 06:06.992
"Yeah !"

06:11.999 --> 06:13.533
Um...

06:20.743 --> 06:24.133
There was a girl
once who blew me

06:24.246 --> 06:29.004
who subsequently
hung herself... to death.

06:29.117 --> 06:31.139
It's true.

06:31.252 --> 06:34.676
Um, she didn't do it
right after, just so you know.

06:34.789 --> 06:37.445
She didn't do it, like,
immediately after.

06:37.558 --> 06:40.047
She did it two years later.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.916
Because that's how long
it takes--

06:43.029 --> 06:46.053
that's how long you
can live with having blown me

06:46.166 --> 06:47.955
before you need to
end your life.

06:48.068 --> 06:51.826
That's how long--
everyone who has blown me

06:51.939 --> 06:55.296
has died two years later of
their own doing.

06:55.409 --> 06:58.699
That's the gestation
period for suicidal shame

06:58.812 --> 07:02.336
that comes from having

07:02.449 --> 07:04.116
had my penis in your mouth.

07:10.624 --> 07:12.979
That's such an awful way to
describe blowin' somebody,

07:13.092 --> 07:16.883
"having had my penis
in your mouth."

07:16.996 --> 07:19.118
It doesn't-- it just
gives you an image of somebody--

07:19.231 --> 07:22.521
Oh, I got something...

07:22.634 --> 07:24.268
Oh, I got this dick
in my mouth.

07:27.792 --> 07:31.298
Do I still have this--
Do you see this dick there?

07:31.411 --> 07:33.923
Oh, shit, yeah, you got his
dick in your mouth.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.481
Did you like your party?

07:45.594 --> 07:48.250
But it's nice just to be
here quiet with you.

07:48.363 --> 07:50.364
The party was hard.

07:54.203 --> 07:55.758
What's that?

07:55.871 --> 07:57.560
It's a present,
what do you think it is?

07:57.673 --> 07:58.705
For me?

07:58.825 --> 08:01.964
No, it's for the little old
lady who lives in your nose.

08:02.077 --> 08:03.899
Of course it's for you.

08:04.012 --> 08:05.044
What, did you really
think I was just

08:05.157 --> 08:06.158
gonna get you slippers?

08:06.271 --> 08:07.370
Can I open it?

08:07.483 --> 08:08.872
Not 'til your birthday.

08:08.985 --> 08:10.207
It is my birthday.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.453
Well, all right then.

08:15.592 --> 08:18.182
Tickets to...
To...

08:18.295 --> 08:19.417
Sabrina Bubble.

08:19.530 --> 08:20.618
That's right!

08:20.731 --> 08:22.387
Those were very hard to get.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.623
Nobody-- nobody gets tickets
to Sabrina Bubble,

08:24.736 --> 08:26.903
but it turns out, she
and I have the same promoter...

08:29.273 --> 08:30.762
You don't like it.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.363
No, I do.

08:32.476 --> 08:34.399
Thank you, Daddy, thank you.

08:34.512 --> 08:36.434
It's so nice.

08:36.547 --> 08:38.136
It's so nice?

08:38.249 --> 08:40.304
It's supposed to be amazing.

08:40.417 --> 08:41.439
I'm sorry, Daddy.

08:41.552 --> 08:42.573
No, no, no, no, don't do that.

08:42.686 --> 08:46.143
I-- I thought you
loved Sabrina Bubble.

08:46.256 --> 08:47.378
Who do you like now?

08:47.491 --> 08:49.180
Lady Gaga.

08:49.293 --> 08:50.782
Lady Gaga?

08:50.895 --> 08:53.585
Jesus, honey,
she's pretty grown up.

08:53.698 --> 08:55.087
She's amazing.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.455
She's my favorite.

08:56.568 --> 08:59.426
I-- I appreciate
that you like her, but I--

08:59.539 --> 09:01.361
Lady Gaga's an artist.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.896
Honey, I wouldn't--
within reason,

09:03.009 --> 09:05.866
I would never tell you
what to listen to, but I--

09:05.979 --> 09:07.834
I want you to grow up to...

09:07.947 --> 09:11.270
to like yourself and have
a job and be strong

09:11.383 --> 09:14.374
and to think about
who you are, not...

09:14.487 --> 09:15.541
I don't want you to
think it's all

09:15.654 --> 09:19.679
about your looks
and glamour and stuff.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.848
Well, can't I grow up like that

09:21.961 --> 09:23.695
and still like Lady Gaga?

09:29.134 --> 09:31.291
So what cities are we lookin'
at for the fall tour?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.127
All right, so I'm thinking
we start in Texas.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.196
Gonna cover
Houston, Austin, Dallas,

09:35.309 --> 09:37.732
San Antonio, then El Paso--
that's one week.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.400
Then we're gonna--
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.035
That's too
many nights in a row.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.570
I told you, I gotta
come home every week

09:42.683 --> 09:44.205
to be with the kids,
three nights a week.

09:44.318 --> 09:45.340
I told you that.

09:45.453 --> 09:47.008
I can't go out for that long.

09:47.121 --> 09:48.810
Dude, Louie, you could
make so much more money

09:48.923 --> 09:50.378
if you stay out longer,
I'm telling you.

09:50.491 --> 09:51.723
I know that.

09:51.836 --> 09:52.837
But I got my kids
Monday, Tuesday,

09:52.950 --> 09:54.049
and Wednesday nights.

09:54.162 --> 09:55.183
I can't work those nights.

09:55.296 --> 09:56.251
That's just the way
it is, Doug.

09:56.364 --> 09:58.520
Okay, fine, I get it.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.689
You know what, we gotta go
back to El Paso next year.

10:00.802 --> 10:02.557
Just ( bleep ) El Paso,
( bleep ) ri'em right in the ass.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.259
All right, all right,
okay, you don't have to...

10:04.372 --> 10:05.660
I'm sorry for cursing.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.529
I understand
about your kids, okay?

10:07.642 --> 10:08.931
I mean, I don't have kids

10:09.044 --> 10:10.765
but I have a father,
so I get it.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.901
Um, did your girl like
the Sabrina Bubble tickets?

10:13.014 --> 10:14.168
You know what,
I forgot to tell you,

10:14.281 --> 10:16.237
she doesn't wanna go.
She didn't wanna go?

10:16.350 --> 10:18.339
No, she likes Lady Gaga now.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.108
Oh, shit, Lady Gaga?

10:20.221 --> 10:21.976
Yeah, can you get tickets?
No.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.045
No, just like that?
No, I can't-- Lady Gaga?

10:24.158 --> 10:25.180
No way, man.

10:25.293 --> 10:26.715
Listen, we work with
Live Promotion Inc.

10:26.828 --> 10:28.349
She's AEG all the way.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.484
Oh...

10:30.597 --> 10:32.120
Does AEG handle any comedians?

10:32.233 --> 10:34.022
Only one.
Who?

10:34.135 --> 10:36.057
Dane Cook.

10:36.170 --> 10:37.659
Oh.

10:37.772 --> 10:38.994
Yeah.
Shit.

10:39.107 --> 10:41.097
Yeah, the arena dog.

10:41.210 --> 10:42.331
I mean, he's gonna be
at the Garden.

10:42.444 --> 10:43.966
If you want, I can
get you backstage passes,

10:44.079 --> 10:45.480
you can go talk to him.

11:01.382 --> 11:02.604
Hey, man.
Hey.

11:02.717 --> 11:03.872
What are you doin' here?

11:03.985 --> 11:05.307
I thought you hated Dane.

11:05.420 --> 11:06.608
I don't hate him.

11:06.721 --> 11:08.444
You should hate him,
he stole your jokes.

11:08.557 --> 11:09.845
I don't know
that he stole my jokes.

11:09.958 --> 11:12.414
Everybody says
he stole your jokes.

11:12.527 --> 11:14.083
He stole your jokes, stupid.

11:14.196 --> 11:15.451
I st came to talk
to him about something.

11:15.564 --> 11:17.019
I don't know...

11:17.132 --> 11:19.255
What are you doing here?
Pickin' up young pussy.

11:19.368 --> 11:21.857
All his fans are college age.

11:21.970 --> 11:24.293
You know... nice and snug.

11:24.406 --> 11:25.494
I get it.

11:25.607 --> 11:26.929
Dane says he'll see you.

11:27.042 --> 11:28.276
Come with us.

11:30.012 --> 11:31.333
All right, man, I'll see l you later.
All right, later.

11:31.446 --> 11:32.546
Take it easy.

11:42.591 --> 11:43.724
Comin' up on the right.

11:53.402 --> 11:54.436
Hold up for the hand-off.

12:30.599 --> 12:31.599
Crazy.

12:31.712 --> 12:32.740
He's coming down.

12:34.142 --> 12:36.732
Hey, Dane.

12:36.845 --> 12:39.135
Can I-- can I talk to
you for a second?

12:39.248 --> 12:40.904
Yeah.

12:41.017 --> 12:43.073
Um, can you guys just
give me a minute?

12:43.186 --> 12:44.787
Yeah.

12:49.994 --> 12:51.395
Thanks.

12:57.570 --> 12:59.959
Uh...

13:00.072 --> 13:01.573
I need to ask you for a favor.

13:05.845 --> 13:08.680
Well, this should be, uh...

13:10.916 --> 13:11.704
That's really something.

13:11.817 --> 13:13.473
Okay.

13:13.586 --> 13:15.341
Look, I--
I know that, um...

13:15.454 --> 13:17.677
"Um" what?

13:17.790 --> 13:19.512
I have a daughter
and, uh--

13:19.625 --> 13:21.514
What can I do for you?

13:21.627 --> 13:23.282
I have a daughter, she's ten,

13:23.395 --> 13:26.051
she just turned ten,
she had a birthday

13:26.164 --> 13:27.820
and she wants
to go see Lady Gaga.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.121
Lady Gaga.

13:29.234 --> 13:30.355
Awesome.

13:30.468 --> 13:32.490
And I know you have the same
promoter as her...

13:32.603 --> 13:34.125
Yeah.

13:34.238 --> 13:37.461
... so I was hoping
that you could, uh...

13:37.574 --> 13:39.864
you could help me...

13:39.977 --> 13:43.101
to get her tickets...

13:43.214 --> 13:45.537
for her birthday.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.038
I could totally
do that for you,

13:47.151 --> 13:49.141
uh, easily.

13:49.254 --> 13:50.709
I know Lady Gaga.

13:50.822 --> 13:53.279
You do?

13:53.392 --> 13:58.217
And, uh, yeah, I could
get you tickets, backstage,

13:58.330 --> 14:01.888
and, uh, I could help you
to make your daughter

14:02.001 --> 14:04.424
very, very happy.

14:04.537 --> 14:07.160
Mm-hmm.

14:07.273 --> 14:09.996
All you have to do is

14:10.109 --> 14:11.864
go on YouTube

14:11.977 --> 14:15.312
and tell everybody that
I did not steal your material.

14:17.248 --> 14:18.570
I never said that
you stole my jokes--

14:18.683 --> 14:20.371
You never said it.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.849
But you let other
people say it.

14:21.962 --> 14:22.963
What let?

14:23.076 --> 14:24.309
I can't tell
people what to say.

14:24.422 --> 14:26.010
You're full of shit!

14:26.123 --> 14:27.245
Dane, look--

14:27.358 --> 14:29.314
You know what?

14:29.427 --> 14:31.549
I'm excited that you're
in this room right now

14:31.662 --> 14:33.985
'cause I waited four years

14:34.098 --> 14:35.265
to tell you this.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.190
Do you know the year
2000 and six?

14:39.303 --> 14:40.858
2000 and six?
Yes.

14:40.971 --> 14:42.460
2000 and six.

14:42.573 --> 14:44.462
You don't really
say "2000 and six."

14:44.575 --> 14:46.964
It's 2006.

14:47.077 --> 14:48.966
"2000 and six" is like saying

14:49.079 --> 14:51.468
the year 2000 and, by the way,
the number six.

14:51.581 --> 14:53.670
"2000 <i>and</i> six"

14:53.783 --> 14:55.972
was the greatest
year of my entire life.

14:56.085 --> 14:57.941
I had a double-platinum
comedy album.

14:58.054 --> 14:59.409
First one ever to exist.

14:59.522 --> 15:01.711
I had a massive HBO special.

15:01.824 --> 15:03.480
I was on
the cover of "TIME."

15:03.593 --> 15:04.781
Well, you were on the corner,

15:04.894 --> 15:05.715
the little corner thing.

15:05.828 --> 15:06.983
It wasn't the--

15:07.096 --> 15:08.518
Not like when the president
is on the cover.

15:08.631 --> 15:10.988
2000 and six.

15:11.101 --> 15:13.224
That should've
been like my triumph,

15:13.337 --> 15:16.394
and I enjoyed it, Louie,
for maybe two months.

15:16.507 --> 15:19.031
Two months before
it started to suck

15:19.144 --> 15:20.566
because everything
I read about me was about

15:20.679 --> 15:23.269
how I stole jokes from you,
which I didn't.

15:23.382 --> 15:25.137
I kind of think you did.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.540
Dude, why would
I steal three jokes from you

15:27.653 --> 15:29.141
when I have hours of material?

15:29.254 --> 15:30.409
Why?
Why would I do that?

15:30.522 --> 15:32.078
Risk my reputation!

15:32.191 --> 15:33.825
'Cause they were funny jokes.

15:35.728 --> 15:37.184
You know what, Louie?

15:37.297 --> 15:38.519
You know what the biggest
lie in the world is?

15:38.632 --> 15:39.920
Is that I'm a rock star,

15:40.033 --> 15:42.122
I'm a millionaire,
I'm-- I'm a comedy behemoth

15:42.235 --> 15:44.525
and you're like a comic's comic

15:44.638 --> 15:47.093
and you're an inside-joke guy
and I'm a sellout

15:47.206 --> 15:49.697
and-- and I sold my soul

15:49.810 --> 15:52.266
and you have-- you have
artistic integrity

15:52.379 --> 15:54.736
and you're a--
you're a good guy.

15:54.849 --> 15:56.270
We're in this room right now,
you and me.

15:56.383 --> 15:58.272
You looking at me.

15:58.385 --> 16:01.988
You let your name
be used to hurt me.

16:04.425 --> 16:07.115
And now you're sitting here,
asking me to use my fame

16:07.228 --> 16:10.451
to get you
tickets to Lady Gaga.

16:10.564 --> 16:13.655
I mean, how shitty do you
feel right now?

16:13.768 --> 16:14.956
Very.

16:15.069 --> 16:16.291
So you admit that
this is all bullshit.

16:16.404 --> 16:18.393
You wanna know what I think?

16:18.506 --> 16:19.906
You wanna...

16:21.508 --> 16:23.731
I don't think that you
saw me do those jokes

16:23.844 --> 16:25.433
and said, "I'm gonna
tell those jokes, too."

16:25.546 --> 16:27.468
I don't think there's a world
where you're that stupid

16:27.581 --> 16:28.837
or that bad a guy.

16:28.950 --> 16:31.306
I-- I do think, though,
that you're like--

16:31.419 --> 16:33.675
you're like
a machine of success.

16:33.788 --> 16:35.877
You're like-- like a rocket

16:35.990 --> 16:38.079
and you're rocketing
to the stars

16:38.192 --> 16:40.781
and your engines
are sucking stuff up.

16:40.894 --> 16:42.616
Stuff is getting sucked up
in your engines,

16:42.729 --> 16:45.831
like birds and bugs
and some of my jokes.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.423
I think you saw me
do them--

16:49.536 --> 16:50.857
I know you saw me do them

16:50.970 --> 16:53.326
and I think they
just went in your brain

16:53.439 --> 16:55.628
and I don't think you
meant to do it,

16:55.741 --> 16:58.330
but I don't think
you stopped yourself, either.

16:58.443 --> 17:00.832
And that's why I never felt
the need to help you

17:00.945 --> 17:03.347
not be hated
by a lot of people.

17:08.586 --> 17:10.643
But I feel bad.

17:10.756 --> 17:13.145
I mean, I do, I feel bad.

17:13.258 --> 17:15.147
That's great that you
feel bad, right here,

17:15.260 --> 17:19.518
in this room, just, y'know,
the two of us, alone.

17:19.631 --> 17:22.654
Maybe if you felt bad publicly,

17:22.767 --> 17:24.623
on the Internet, then this
could all be behind us--

17:24.736 --> 17:26.459
Well, well, are you
willing to admit,

17:26.572 --> 17:29.228
even for a minute, that
maybe-- maybe you inadvertently

17:29.341 --> 17:30.463
took 'emok or some--

17:30.576 --> 17:32.165
maybe you had some part of it?

17:32.278 --> 17:34.534
Maybe they got in your brain
and you shat 'em out.

17:34.647 --> 17:37.583
Maybe it was inadvertent,
but maybe it did happen.

17:40.553 --> 17:41.875
I-- I shouldn't have
come here, man--

17:41.988 --> 17:44.510
Louie, do you want the tickets?

17:44.623 --> 17:46.012
Because I'm sure that your--

17:46.125 --> 17:47.347
Honestly, I think
that your daughter--

17:47.460 --> 17:49.115
I bet she's really nice.

17:49.228 --> 17:50.650
But you got a lot of
nerve comin' in here, man.

17:50.763 --> 17:52.719
I don't know, it's like
I don't have kids,

17:52.832 --> 17:54.787
so I don't--
I don't get it,

17:54.900 --> 17:58.424
but it must mean a lot
for you to, you know,

17:58.537 --> 18:00.159
come in here and do this,

18:00.272 --> 18:02.872
so, um...
you want the tickets?

18:02.985 --> 18:03.986
Thank you, I--

18:04.099 --> 18:05.532
Yes, I'd like the tickets.

18:05.645 --> 18:07.067
How many?
Two, please.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.035
You got 'em, mm-hmm, okay.
That's good.

18:09.148 --> 18:12.239
Thank you, I appreciate it
a lot, seriously.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.607
You know, the one thing
that, like,

18:13.720 --> 18:17.345
really just...

18:17.458 --> 18:19.948
gets to me
is the whole thing about,

18:20.061 --> 18:22.418
um, people saying that
I stole the joke about

18:22.531 --> 18:24.720
the itchy asshole?

18:24.833 --> 18:30.326
Because... I-- I get
an itchy asshole... a lot.

18:30.439 --> 18:32.428
So for you to think that
you're the only person

18:32.541 --> 18:34.430
who got an itchy
asshole in America--

18:34.543 --> 18:37.433
I mean, that's like, that's...
that's bullshit, y'know?

18:37.546 --> 18:41.103
You should try a...
a natural laundry detergent.

18:41.216 --> 18:42.818
What?

18:48.557 --> 18:49.712
Your daughter is ten?

18:49.825 --> 18:51.347
Yeah.

18:51.460 --> 18:53.182
Why are you
getting her tickets?

18:53.295 --> 18:55.595
What do you mean?

18:55.708 --> 18:56.708
She's ten.

18:56.821 --> 18:58.488
I mean, I remember being ten.

18:58.601 --> 19:01.290
An envelope when
you're ten is...

19:01.403 --> 19:03.292
it's a bummer.

19:03.405 --> 19:06.428
You know, when you're a kid,
you want, like, a box.

19:06.541 --> 19:08.397
You know, why don't
you go get her something?

19:08.510 --> 19:10.365
Get her something, like
a gift that you found,

19:10.478 --> 19:12.934
from her daddy, you know?

19:13.047 --> 19:14.202
A box is exciting
when you're a kid.

19:14.315 --> 19:16.182
An envelope is, you know...

19:24.958 --> 19:26.359
Oh, shit.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.622
Hey, you want a snack?

19:34.735 --> 19:36.123
Oh, yeah, thanks, Dad.

19:36.236 --> 19:38.693
No, not yet, this first.

19:38.806 --> 19:39.693
Can I open it?

19:39.806 --> 19:40.806
Yes!

19:52.784 --> 19:54.173
Thanks, Daddy.

19:54.286 --> 19:55.519
That's nice.

20:00.357 --> 20:01.946
Okay, happy birthday.

20:02.059 --> 20:03.427
Thanks.

20:31.574 --> 20:32.574
Hey, what's up?

20:32.687 --> 20:34.962
You didn't open that on
the kitchen table, did you?

20:35.075 --> 20:36.163
Nope.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.044
Are you lying?
Yep.

20:39.451 --> 20:40.451
Why do you do that?

20:40.564 --> 20:42.503
The opener
is right in the drawer.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.773
Yeah, but the table's
right here.

20:44.886 --> 20:46.708
Louie!

20:46.821 --> 20:48.222
I love you.

20:53.661 --> 20:54.828
I love you, too.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.097
You're everything to me.
