step-by-step.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.143
I then take the food
to an average suburban home,

17:41.226 --> 17:45.189

as a family enjoys the food

17:45.272 --> 17:46.440

masterfully prepared.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.400
- Wow. Yeah, I'd watch that.
That sounds really cool.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.110
- But it doesn't stop there.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.070
I never leave the house.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.281
I take over the husband's role.

He is reduced to a cuckold
sleeping on the couch

17:56.450 --> 17:58.577
while I enjoy the spoils
of marital relations

17:58.660 --> 17:59.495

17:59.578 --> 18:02.247

Soon, even the children
are calling me Papa.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.458
- Uh...

18:04.541 --> 18:06.293
- At the end of each episode,

18:06.376 --> 18:08.462
I sneak out
in the middle of the night,

18:08.545 --> 18:09.546
and it's a different
recipe each week--

18:09.630 --> 18:13.342
one week Italian food,
the next week French cuisine--

18:13.425 --> 18:17.137
and every week, a man is reduced
to a blubbering fool.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.014
- Wow.
- I call the show...
