WEBVTT

00:01.448 --> 00:03.848
<i>Previously on Stargate SG-1.</i>

00:03.917 --> 00:06.408
We have a time machine.
We can go back and get the ZPM.

00:06.486 --> 00:09.284
We don't know where it is now,
but we do know where it was.

00:09.356 --> 00:12.814
Giza, 3000 B.C.

00:12.893 --> 00:14.554
That's Katep, and his brother, Salatis.

00:16.430 --> 00:20.025
Nice. All right,
we got a little problem here.

00:20.100 --> 00:23.160
We alter this timeline,
and the future is already different.

00:23.236 --> 00:26.103
We brought you here because
of what had been recorded...

00:26.173 --> 00:28.471
on the tape inside that camera.

00:28.542 --> 00:31.636
<i>I'm part of a team called SG-1...</i>

00:31.712 --> 00:34.579
<i>and we have just traveled
back in time 5,000 years.</i>

00:34.648 --> 00:36.741
Look at this as a way
to change everything.

00:36.817 --> 00:39.012
We're supposed to be a team.
We save the world.

00:40.487 --> 00:42.682
It was exactly where
you said it would be.

00:42.756 --> 00:44.519
If anybody should be going, it's us.

00:45.859 --> 00:48.419
The only reason you have
this Stargate is because of us.

00:48.495 --> 00:50.156
- I'm aware of that.
- I'm a linguist.

00:50.230 --> 00:52.164
By all accounts,
your team may need one.

00:52.232 --> 00:54.757
What if something goes wrong
with the gate on the other end?

00:54.835 --> 00:57.827
Neither of you have had any
military training whatsoever.

00:57.904 --> 01:00.634
Have either one of you ever
even fired a weapon of any kind?

01:01.575 --> 01:03.805
Unless you count
launching a rocket.

01:05.212 --> 01:08.079
Look, I am sorry.

01:08.148 --> 01:11.709
Your expertise may be needed
sometime in the future, but for now-

01:11.785 --> 01:14.253
Well, can I ask who is going?

01:21.962 --> 01:24.556
I don't understand.
What made you change your mind?

01:29.469 --> 01:33.963
- Hi, Jack.
- That's Colonel, Major.

01:34.040 --> 01:38.477
- You're retired.
- I was.

01:38.545 --> 01:41.378
I take it you two know each other.

01:41.448 --> 01:43.609
Yeah, we served together
a long time ago.

01:43.683 --> 01:47.175
- It wasn't that long ago.
- Major Kawalsky has been assigned...

01:47.254 --> 01:49.984
to assemble the team that
will go through the Stargate.

01:50.056 --> 01:52.547
And you knew I couldn't
say no if he was involved?

01:52.626 --> 01:54.753
Oh, come on, Colonel.
You don't owe me anything.

01:54.828 --> 01:59.288
Admit it. You gotta be a little curious,
traveling to a different planet.

01:59.366 --> 02:02.802
- Through a wormhole?
- I know I am.

02:02.869 --> 02:05.599
Sir, with all due respect,
what are they still doing here?

02:05.672 --> 02:08.766
I'm not sure. Airman, please escort-

02:08.842 --> 02:12.243
Wait, wait. We were all on that tape.

02:12.312 --> 02:15.008
That tape had nothing to do with it.

02:15.081 --> 02:17.447
Jack O'Neill's one of the best
I've served with.

02:17.517 --> 02:21.817
You may not care that this timeline
is a result of tampering with the past...

02:21.888 --> 02:23.685
but you have to acknowledge
that the tape said...

02:23.757 --> 02:26.385
the planet you're going to
is enemy territory.

02:26.460 --> 02:29.657
An enemy that is way more advanced
than us technologically.

02:29.729 --> 02:31.219
What's your point?

02:31.298 --> 02:34.734
You're literally walking into
a totally alien situation...

02:34.801 --> 02:36.996
outmanned and outgunned.

02:38.472 --> 02:40.633
Do we have a choice?

04:00.220 --> 04:03.678
We've only been able to activate the
interior lights and the dialing computer.

04:03.757 --> 04:06.157
But, according to the tape,
you have the gene...

04:06.226 --> 04:11.664
- that can make this ship fly.
- And travel through time.

04:11.731 --> 04:15.167
Presumably you don't have to do that
if you don't want to.

04:43.163 --> 04:45.791
- What do I do?
- Sit down.

04:56.509 --> 04:58.443
Now what?

04:58.511 --> 05:00.672
You're supposed to have the ability
to fly this thing.

05:00.747 --> 05:02.237
With your mind.

05:09.756 --> 05:12.657
- Try not to think about the past.
- Or the future.

05:26.172 --> 05:29.539
- You so have to let us go with you.
- Please.

05:40.453 --> 05:42.353
Put those on.

05:49.029 --> 05:51.554
How come we have to
wear these and you don't?

05:53.066 --> 05:56.399
Okay, people. Let me remind you.

05:57.671 --> 06:00.299
This mission's recon only.
Do not engage the enemy.

06:00.373 --> 06:05.242
I'm allowing the use of this ship because
of the tactical advantage it provides.

06:05.311 --> 06:10.510
Under no circumstances is it to be
used to travel through time.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.881
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

06:14.287 --> 06:17.279
Never in my life would I have
imagined giving that order.

06:21.428 --> 06:23.896
Are you absolutely certain
about them, Colonel?

06:26.332 --> 06:28.323
No, sir.

06:30.070 --> 06:32.231
Good luck, and Godspeed.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.070
All aboard.

06:48.888 --> 06:51.118
Hey. Watch this.

06:57.197 --> 07:02.191
Oh. By the way, you do have the address
to get us back home, correct?

07:02.268 --> 07:06.034
- Yeah.
- Good. Dial it up.

07:24.324 --> 07:28.317
I give this no more than
a 50-50 chance of working.

07:28.394 --> 07:31.488
According to the tape,
it worked for eight years.

07:42.542 --> 07:43.600
Wow.

07:45.078 --> 07:49.515
I'm certainly glad it's not me
going through that thing.

07:52.719 --> 07:56.018
- Any idea what to expect?
- Not really.

07:56.089 --> 07:59.252
According to the tape, we're going
to be demolecularized...

07:59.325 --> 08:01.987
transmitted over 2,000
light years through subspace...

08:02.061 --> 08:05.155
and then rematerialized
on the other side.

08:06.166 --> 08:10.034
- I did not need to know that.
- Okay.

08:12.205 --> 08:15.641
<i>Gateship One, you're go for launch.</i>

08:15.708 --> 08:19.508
- Gateship?
- A ship that goes through the gate, so-

08:22.282 --> 08:25.615
- All right.
- What?

08:25.685 --> 08:28.984
A ship that goes through the gate.
It's a gateship.

08:29.956 --> 08:31.890
I thought it was clever.

08:57.417 --> 08:58.907
That was cool.

08:58.985 --> 09:02.853
- I didn't feel anything.
- Doesn't feel like we're pulling any G's.

09:03.590 --> 09:05.581
This thing must have
inertial dampeners.

09:06.426 --> 09:08.724
See any enemy troops
when we came through?

09:08.795 --> 09:11.628
No, but that doesn't mean
we weren't detected.

09:11.698 --> 09:13.256
Is that a city?

09:17.804 --> 09:19.795
I'm gonna set her down
in those trees.

09:28.481 --> 09:31.780
I thought the reason why we brought
the ship was so we didn't have to walk.

09:31.851 --> 09:35.514
You can't just fly into an alien city.
The mission is "stealth recon."

09:35.588 --> 09:38.580
- Meaning, "undetected."
- Meaning, "shut up."

09:38.658 --> 09:40.592
Sorry.

09:41.895 --> 09:43.692
Donner, Mansfield, guard the ship.

09:43.763 --> 09:45.993
Bosworth, you're with us.
Come on. Move out.

09:48.067 --> 09:50.297
Why did we have to park so far away?

09:57.210 --> 09:59.644
Seriously, why did we bring them?

10:01.447 --> 10:04.814
I don't know.
I guess I had a gut feeling.

10:04.884 --> 10:07.375
Like Peru?

10:07.453 --> 10:10.547
All right, that didn't
work out so well.

10:10.623 --> 10:13.615
- Sierra Leone? Uganda?
- All right, look.

10:13.693 --> 10:18.187
Maybe the better question here is, why
did you invite me on this dog-and-pony?

10:18.264 --> 10:21.791
Let's just say I prefer
my gut instinct over yours.

10:30.710 --> 10:33.611
What's with the-

11:08.348 --> 11:09.838
Hello? Anybody there?

11:11.451 --> 11:13.715
We're all here.

11:15.588 --> 11:20.719
- Where are we?
- It looks like a prison cell.

11:21.494 --> 11:24.895
- Anybody see my glasses?
- I think they must have taken them.

11:25.965 --> 11:27.899
Why would they do that?

11:47.954 --> 11:50.388
- Teal'c.
- From the tape?

11:50.456 --> 11:53.721
If you know my name,
then you know enough to fear me.

11:56.662 --> 11:58.425
Look, I know this might
sound a little crazy, but-

11:58.498 --> 12:00.830
- Who are you?
- Hi!

12:05.371 --> 12:09.034
We're from the Tauri.
We call it Earth.

12:10.943 --> 12:14.879
You see, we found this tape
from the past.

12:16.616 --> 12:19.881
You see, apparently
we're a part of a team.

12:21.020 --> 12:23.545
The four of us,
not the two of them.

12:23.623 --> 12:25.750
We're called SG-1.

12:25.825 --> 12:28.385
We used this time device to go back
in the past, and we screwed up the past...

12:28.461 --> 12:29.951
and changed the future.

12:30.029 --> 12:32.759
See, you're not supposed to be still
Apophis's first prime.

12:32.832 --> 12:35.699
The Jaffa are supposed
to be free, and...

12:35.768 --> 12:37.895
we know that you think that
the Goa'uld are false gods.

12:41.707 --> 12:43.072
That wasn't necessary.

12:43.142 --> 12:46.236
Speak of such blasphemy again
and I will kill you where you stand.

12:46.312 --> 12:51.079
Look, I know this is a lot
to throw at you all at one time...

12:51.150 --> 12:53.778
and you gotta put up a little show
for the boys here...

12:54.720 --> 12:59.316
but the fact is, we know the truth.

12:59.392 --> 13:01.257
See, it's on the tape.

13:01.327 --> 13:03.124
You have to see it.

13:03.863 --> 13:06.957
It's in the-
It's in the camera that...

13:07.033 --> 13:08.933
you took from the bag
that you took from me?

13:09.001 --> 13:11.492
If you bring it to me, I can show you
how it works, and we can-

13:11.571 --> 13:15.905
Or, we could go and see it.

13:15.975 --> 13:19.069
Over at wherever you want to go.

13:36.362 --> 13:39.854
Kneel before your god.

13:39.932 --> 13:41.559
Kneeling.

13:49.275 --> 13:52.836
- Who are you?
- Name's Daniel Jackson.

13:52.912 --> 13:55.176
If you give me back my eyeglasses,
I could actually see-

13:55.248 --> 13:57.045
He claims he's of the Tauri.

13:58.017 --> 13:59.814
You weren't supposed
to tell him that.

13:59.886 --> 14:04.949
<i>- The Tauri have no Chapa'ai.
- Oh! Sorry. Guess I was wrong.</i>

14:05.024 --> 14:08.687
I'm sure your information is correct.
In fact, I'm usually quite wrong.

14:08.761 --> 14:12.959
Quite unreliable, actually.
To be honest with you, I'm insane.

14:13.032 --> 14:14.363
Speak!

14:19.071 --> 14:20.538
Bring him.

14:35.755 --> 14:37.848
I think there is much you can tell me.

14:38.958 --> 14:40.949
If you want to know about
the early settlers of Mesopotamia...

14:41.027 --> 14:43.359
I am somewhat of an expert.

14:55.908 --> 14:57.842
It's been over an hour.

14:59.412 --> 15:01.346
Maybe you shouldn't have said anything.

15:02.815 --> 15:07.115
All I said was,
"This is gonna sound a little crazy."

15:08.921 --> 15:11.981
While there are obvious similarities...

15:12.058 --> 15:14.185
our timeline is different
from the one in which Teal'c...

15:14.260 --> 15:16.251
came to believe that
the Goa'uld were false gods.

15:18.497 --> 15:20.761
Are you saying this guy
might not turn?

15:22.535 --> 15:26.301
- It's possible.
- And you're telling me this now?

15:42.955 --> 15:46.721
- This one is strong.
- Leave us.

15:54.967 --> 15:57.731
You will tell me all that you know.

16:26.832 --> 16:28.322
What's goin' on?

16:29.769 --> 16:32.260
Show me.

16:45.184 --> 16:47.675
<i>Teal'c, you should say something.</i>

16:52.258 --> 16:54.692
<i>The Jaffa are free.</i>

16:54.760 --> 16:58.856
<i>False god that he is,
Apophis is long dead.</i>

16:58.931 --> 17:01.422
<i>A new medicine, tretonin...</i>

17:01.500 --> 17:04.025
<i>has liberated us from
our dependence upon symbiotes.</i>

17:04.770 --> 17:08.706
<i>The Jaffa have risen up as brothers and
sisters and defeated the Goa'uld.</i>

17:08.774 --> 17:10.503
What trickery is this?

17:10.576 --> 17:14.603
<i>- It's not a trick.
- You have a son:</i>

17:14.680 --> 17:17.205
<i>Rya'c, who is now married...</i>

17:17.283 --> 17:20.878
<i>and a strong leader among
the newly formed Jaffa nation.</i>

17:20.953 --> 17:24.081
<i>If all these things
have not come to pass...</i>

17:24.156 --> 17:26.784
<i>you must believe that the present,
in which you now live...</i>

17:26.859 --> 17:30.795
<i>exists only because the past
has been mistakenly altered.</i>

17:30.863 --> 17:32.922
<i>It must be restored.</i>

17:34.867 --> 17:39.429
Please, you have to help us.

17:39.505 --> 17:43.737
The reason we came was to get you, so
we could go back in time and fix things.

17:44.643 --> 17:46.736
That's not true.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.548
We just want to get out of here.

17:50.616 --> 17:54.518
If you can help us,
we'll do our best to help you.

17:54.587 --> 17:56.555
I cannot free you.

18:00.526 --> 18:04.360
What about our weapons?
Our vests? Can you get us those?

18:13.172 --> 18:15.606
Easy, easy!

18:15.674 --> 18:17.665
Get outta here.

18:21.647 --> 18:23.877
Pewter pissants.

18:26.719 --> 18:28.209
- Hey-
- I didn't tell 'em anything.

18:28.287 --> 18:31.552
- Good for you! How are you feelin'?
- Not so good, really.

18:31.624 --> 18:33.615
Sorry.

18:34.994 --> 18:36.518
Maybe this'll make you feel better.

18:42.334 --> 18:45.235
- How'd you-
- Teal'c.

18:45.304 --> 18:48.102
He brought us the camera.
I showed him the tape.

18:48.174 --> 18:50.108
I don't think he can be trusted.

18:50.176 --> 18:52.440
He gave us our weapons back.
That's a good start.

18:52.511 --> 18:55.275
He's gonna meet us
on the way back to the ship.

18:55.347 --> 18:58.976
Safety off, point and shoot.
Not at me.

19:00.252 --> 19:03.915
- I don't really like guns.
- Neither do I.

19:03.989 --> 19:05.479
How do you feel about explosives?

19:05.558 --> 19:07.822
- Those I like a little better.
- Cover.

19:07.893 --> 19:10.123
Let's go.

19:18.671 --> 19:22.334
<i>- Airman, this is O'Neill.
- We were starting to get worried.</i>

19:22.408 --> 19:24.501
We're on our way. ETA, ten minutes.

19:29.415 --> 19:32.009
We gotta get goin' here.
We got a whole battalion on our ass.

19:40.726 --> 19:42.489
What the hell was that?

19:45.764 --> 19:48.824
Shoot him, Jack. Let's shoot him
and get the hell out of here.

19:49.568 --> 19:52.366
- Why'd you do that?
- He was a Goa'uld.

19:52.438 --> 19:54.736
Apophis implanted him
with a symbiote...

19:54.807 --> 19:57.139
in order to gain access
to the knowledge in his mind.

19:57.209 --> 19:59.700
- How do you know?
- I can sense it.

19:59.778 --> 20:03.646
- Your friend did not give in to torture.
- He's lying.

20:03.716 --> 20:06.913
- Why would he lie, Kawalsky?
- If he wanted us all dead...

20:06.986 --> 20:09.454
why aren't we surrounded
by Jaffa right now?

20:09.522 --> 20:12.355
We will be in a few seconds
if we don't get the hell out of here now.

20:12.424 --> 20:14.051
I'm not takin' him with us.

20:14.126 --> 20:17.061
Apophis has ordered a fleet
of Ha'tak vessels to the Tauri.

20:17.997 --> 20:19.487
He's sending ships to Earth?

20:19.565 --> 20:22.398
The symbiote implanted
within Daniel Jackson was a spy...

20:22.468 --> 20:24.595
intended to accompany you.

20:24.670 --> 20:27.696
Apophis now knows
what Daniel Jackson knew.

20:27.773 --> 20:29.832
He knows that you came in a ship.

20:29.909 --> 20:32.343
He knows that the Tauri is a threat.

20:32.411 --> 20:34.106
How the hell do we know
you're not a spy?

20:48.794 --> 20:50.785
His eyes glowed.

21:01.607 --> 21:03.097
He's dead.

21:06.312 --> 21:08.246
Go! Go!

21:35.341 --> 21:37.901
- Kawalsky!
- Go! Start it up!

21:49.555 --> 21:52.854
- Kawalsky's been hit!
- Go!

22:18.017 --> 22:22.351
- Are you injured?
- No.

22:22.421 --> 22:25.185
I've just never seen
anyone killed before.

22:25.257 --> 22:29.023
Daniel and Kawalsky?

22:29.094 --> 22:31.892
Oh, my God!
You've been shot!

22:32.831 --> 22:35.026
It will heal.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.829
All right, we got some problems here.

22:50.582 --> 22:53.312
- Gliders.
- I can't shake 'em, either.

22:54.887 --> 22:56.821
The gate will be well-guarded.

22:58.557 --> 23:00.320
I don't think we're gonna
make it to the gate.

23:04.463 --> 23:06.522
There is a way out.

23:07.266 --> 23:09.393
Was there a Stargate
on this planet 5,000 years ago?

23:09.468 --> 23:10.560
I believe so.

23:34.393 --> 23:35.883
I think you did it.

23:37.096 --> 23:40.896
- What has he done?
- I think we just traveled back in time.

23:40.966 --> 23:43.366
Check it out. Dial Earth.

24:04.156 --> 24:06.249
Well, this is definitely ancient Egypt.

24:07.659 --> 24:09.593
Those Ha'tak vessels
bore the mark of Ra.

24:09.661 --> 24:12.562
He ruled on Earth during this period.

24:12.631 --> 24:14.963
<i>It is likely we were detected
exiting the Chapa'ai.</i>

24:15.033 --> 24:18.969
Well, there's no ships on our tail.

24:19.037 --> 24:20.971
But I think we'll skedaddle anyway.

24:22.574 --> 24:25.543
You saying you're on board
with trying to fix the past?

24:25.611 --> 24:27.977
Well, we did kinda screw up
our timeline, didn't we?

24:29.214 --> 24:30.909
The only way to stop
the invasion on Earth...

24:30.983 --> 24:33.144
is to make sure
that it never happens.

24:33.218 --> 24:36.278
Yeah. Remind me how we do that again?

24:49.334 --> 24:51.928
All right. Here's the plan.

24:53.338 --> 24:55.863
We make contact with the locals.

24:58.510 --> 25:02.105
- And then?
- That's all I got so far.

25:04.216 --> 25:07.982
- Any idea what time it is exactly?
- 3:00.

25:08.053 --> 25:10.044
Sorry. I kinda meant what year.

25:11.757 --> 25:16.160
Well, you and Daniel said there was
some kind of a failed rebellion.

25:16.228 --> 25:19.026
In 2995 BC.

25:19.097 --> 25:21.031
- BC?
- Colonel.

25:21.099 --> 25:24.000
Kidding. And call me Jack, will ya?

25:33.412 --> 25:37.439
Hey! It's all right, folks.
We come in peace.

25:37.516 --> 25:39.643
Nothin' to be afraid of.

25:40.786 --> 25:42.811
I doubt they speak English.

25:43.822 --> 25:46.313
- Hello.
- He does.

25:47.326 --> 25:49.157
Yes, I am Katep.

25:49.228 --> 25:51.355
- I am Jack-
- O'Neill.

25:51.430 --> 25:55.526
Colonel Carter. And Teal'c.

25:55.601 --> 25:58.035
- How'd you know-
- Please come with me. Ra's patrols...

25:58.103 --> 26:02.335
come through here often, and they
must not see you- especially you.

26:02.407 --> 26:04.500
Please. Come.

26:09.748 --> 26:11.306
Please.

26:19.992 --> 26:23.553
- How do you know who we are?
- This is not the first time we have met.

26:24.663 --> 26:28.963
- You knew the other SG-1 team.
- Five years ago, you came.

26:29.034 --> 26:32.731
You were witness to the death
of my brother at the hands of Ra.

26:32.804 --> 26:36.296
After you were trapped here,
we planned an uprising together.

26:37.342 --> 26:41.779
- So much for causality.
- Ra is still here. We have seen his ship.

26:42.748 --> 26:46.411
Our first attempt at gathering forces
for the rebellion did not go well.

26:46.485 --> 26:50.819
We had to expose ourselves
to those who proved still loyal to Ra.

26:50.889 --> 26:54.586
You were captured and executed
long before the plan could be finished.

26:55.327 --> 26:56.760
Really?

26:58.664 --> 27:01.155
- All of us?
- All but one.

27:15.981 --> 27:19.314
- Well, this can't be a good sign.
- Why is that?

27:19.384 --> 27:24.253
- Where am I?
- Ancient Egypt?

27:24.323 --> 27:26.655
No, I mean the "me"
from your timeline.

27:26.725 --> 27:30.024
- I killed you.
- Why?

27:30.095 --> 27:34.156
- You were a Goa'uld spy.
- A good reason.

27:34.232 --> 27:36.723
- It was horrible.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

27:36.802 --> 27:40.795
- Why are you here?
- Yes. Excellent question.

27:41.773 --> 27:45.231
- You don't know.
- I thought I did, there for a while.

27:45.310 --> 27:48.643
And then I realized I didn't.

27:50.215 --> 27:53.548
- Well, I know why I'm here.
- Good. Let's start there.

27:53.618 --> 27:55.643
We came back in time to get a ZPM.

27:55.721 --> 27:58.849
Right. It was buried with the tape.

27:58.924 --> 28:04.021
Why is it so important? I think
you were about to explain it, but the-

28:04.096 --> 28:06.155
The batteries on the camera ran out.

28:06.231 --> 28:09.894
Long story.
Why don't you take a seat?

28:14.706 --> 28:16.970
Basically, we got trapped here because...

28:17.042 --> 28:19.567
you didn't want to affect the timeline.

28:20.312 --> 28:22.507
But ultimately, you and you...

28:22.581 --> 28:25.141
couldn't stand the idea of living out
the rest of your lives under Ra's rule...

28:25.217 --> 28:26.946
without doing anything.

28:27.019 --> 28:29.487
Remember, there was a rebellion
here on Earth.

28:29.554 --> 28:32.148
That's how the gate got buried
in the first place. So, we figured...

28:32.224 --> 28:34.385
what difference does it make
if we're involved or not?

28:35.093 --> 28:37.493
Unfortunately, we never got
a chance to execute the plan.

28:37.562 --> 28:40.554
- We heard.
- We tried to do too much, too fast.

28:40.632 --> 28:44.124
Since then, Katep and I have been slowly
building up an underground movement.

28:44.202 --> 28:46.932
I can only assume things don't
go well, because if you're here...

28:47.005 --> 28:49.405
you saw the tape,
and the future still needs fixing.

28:49.474 --> 28:52.875
- Something like that.
- We didn't just see the tape.

28:52.944 --> 28:56.573
- We saw the tablet.
- What tablet?

28:57.949 --> 29:00.577
The one you haven't written yet.

29:00.652 --> 29:03.849
And put where the Stargate
was supposed to be buried.

29:03.922 --> 29:05.014
Supposed to be?

29:05.090 --> 29:08.924
In our timeline, the rebellion
you planned actually works.

29:08.994 --> 29:12.122
Ra ends up leaving,
and Earth is freed...

29:12.197 --> 29:14.859
but Ra takes the Stargate with him.

29:16.134 --> 29:19.194
- Okay, that's a problem.
- Yes!

29:19.271 --> 29:23.867
The gate is never found at Giza.
None of us join the Stargate program.

29:23.942 --> 29:28.777
But you left a tablet in
an obscure, Egyptian dialect...

29:28.847 --> 29:30.838
telling us the date of the rebellion...

29:30.916 --> 29:33.942
and where to find
the second Stargate in Antarctica.

29:34.019 --> 29:37.250
Good for me. So you're here to make
sure Ra doesn't take this Stargate.

29:39.057 --> 29:40.547
It's a plan.

29:43.261 --> 29:45.729
- Jaffa.
- We must hide.

29:45.797 --> 29:47.458
Where?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.592
In here.

30:42.420 --> 30:43.978
Sweet.

31:02.340 --> 31:05.275
We have secret stores of weapons like this
in positions throughout the region.

31:06.711 --> 31:10.078
- How many troops?
- A couple of thousand.

31:10.148 --> 31:11.638
But that's not really the issue.

31:11.716 --> 31:14.913
According to you, my own account
of history says we win the revolt.

31:14.986 --> 31:17.853
We just need to make sure that
the gate stays here and gets buried.

31:17.923 --> 31:19.914
Which means we have to steal it
and hide it from Ra.

31:19.991 --> 31:22.084
But it's out in the open,
close to his ship.

31:22.160 --> 31:26.494
Holding such a position against a Ha'tak
would be virtually impossible.

31:26.565 --> 31:29.864
- Even for a short bit of time.
- Also, the gate is kinda heavy.

31:29.935 --> 31:34.167
- Well, we also have a ship.
- Yes, but you see...

31:34.239 --> 31:39.233
the ship fits in the gate,
not the other way around.

31:40.345 --> 31:44.042
There has to be a way that
we can cable the gate to the ship.

31:44.115 --> 31:46.709
- Fly it out.
- But we still gotta get close to it...

31:46.785 --> 31:49.185
- without being detected.
- That's easy.

31:49.254 --> 31:51.745
The ship has a cloaking device.

31:53.191 --> 31:55.125
Makes it invisible.

31:55.927 --> 31:57.724
You're telling me this now?

31:57.796 --> 31:59.764
I was sure I mentioned it
on the tape.

32:01.433 --> 32:05.369
If we were able to time our approach
to coordinate with the uprising...

32:05.437 --> 32:08.838
- we may yet have a chance.
- We'll need to test the cloak.

32:08.907 --> 32:10.898
We took an awful lot of damage
coming out of Chulak.

32:10.976 --> 32:12.910
Because we didn't know
about the damn cloak!

32:12.978 --> 32:14.570
I was sure I'd mentioned it on the tape.

32:23.855 --> 32:25.914
They are gone.

32:28.026 --> 32:31.257
Do you ever wonder what
your life's gonna be like in the future?

32:32.564 --> 32:34.964
Won't really be my life, will it?

32:35.033 --> 32:38.525
No, but still. I mean, I've led such
a small and unimportant existence...

32:38.603 --> 32:41.697
I can't ever imagine being
a hero who saves the planet.

32:43.141 --> 32:45.735
Well, we do have a time machine.

32:45.810 --> 32:48.176
- We could go check it out.
- No way.

32:48.246 --> 32:51.272
We've already screwed up enough.
Once we're done with the gate...

32:51.349 --> 32:53.510
we need to destroy the ship.

32:53.585 --> 32:55.576
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

32:58.623 --> 33:00.614
You mean we have to stay here?

33:01.993 --> 33:04.223
I wonder if the future me
has a boyfriend?

33:21.546 --> 33:27.007
- So, what do I do?
- Try thinking, "invisible."

33:31.556 --> 33:33.524
Okay.

33:38.530 --> 33:41.055
How do we know if it's working?

33:47.172 --> 33:48.662
Nope.

33:54.946 --> 33:58.473
Your strategy is good.

33:58.550 --> 34:00.950
But it does not work well
as a distraction in our plan...

34:01.019 --> 34:03.385
<i>to steal the Chapa'ai.</i>

34:03.455 --> 34:05.355
Wait a minute. We know
this plan works. If we alter it-

34:05.423 --> 34:06.720
We may fail.

34:06.791 --> 34:09.726
With this plan, the uprising succeeds
and Ra leaves.

34:09.794 --> 34:13.321
<i>And Ra takes the Chapa'ai.
If we are to be successful...</i>

34:13.398 --> 34:15.730
<i>in keeping Ra from
taking the Chapa'ai...</i>

34:15.800 --> 34:19.759
we must focus the efforts of the rebellion
on distracting him from it.

34:24.509 --> 34:26.739
Trust me.

34:36.921 --> 34:41.756
- How's it goin'?
- Never seen this technology before.

34:41.993 --> 34:45.190
You're supposed to be a genius.
That's why I brought you along.

34:45.263 --> 34:47.197
I'm working on it.

34:47.265 --> 34:49.426
I think the power relay was overloaded.

34:49.501 --> 34:52.993
I may be able to reroute the circuit
to the control interface, but-

34:55.473 --> 34:57.600
What?

34:57.675 --> 35:00.143
It's just a little weird, hearin'
that kind of stuff come out of...

35:00.211 --> 35:03.237
- someone so-
- So what?

35:03.314 --> 35:04.542
Hot.

35:06.618 --> 35:09.143
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:11.256 --> 35:12.917
Wow.

35:14.559 --> 35:18.290
It's just you-You're not
the kind of guy I usually attract.

35:20.465 --> 35:22.558
- No?
- No.

35:24.002 --> 35:26.493
God. Wow!

35:26.571 --> 35:30.234
- This is kinda awkward.
- Yeah, it's gettin' there.

35:30.308 --> 35:32.936
I'm kind of attracted to Daniel.

35:37.115 --> 35:39.276
What?

35:44.889 --> 35:47.483
- Really?
- Sorry.

35:48.693 --> 35:50.718
No, that's okay. No problem there.

35:50.795 --> 35:53.059
It's just, you know.

35:53.131 --> 35:56.362
First impressions,
I kinda thought he was-

36:00.705 --> 36:03.003
Never mind.

36:21.159 --> 36:22.649
Carter.

36:22.727 --> 36:26.629
<i>- How's it goin'in there?
- I think I'm almost there.</i>

36:26.698 --> 36:29.997
That's good. We're about
to have some company.

36:41.312 --> 36:43.678
We have a patrol on its way here.

36:47.719 --> 36:49.448
Try it.

36:57.228 --> 36:59.219
Nothing's happening.

37:02.901 --> 37:05.131
<i>Hey, guys.
We got a little problem here.</i>

37:06.738 --> 37:09.206
Carter, forget it.
I'm just gonna take off.

37:18.149 --> 37:19.548
God-

37:20.652 --> 37:24.179
- Now that's not working.
- Oh, boy.

37:26.858 --> 37:29.349
Try the cloak now.

37:35.433 --> 37:36.923
Did it work?

37:50.214 --> 37:52.614
Apparently.

38:10.201 --> 38:12.396
What?

38:14.372 --> 38:16.465
Go, go, go, go!

38:18.876 --> 38:21.276
Get down. Whoa.

38:21.346 --> 38:24.281
- This could be a problem.
- You think?

38:24.349 --> 38:26.579
If they penetrate the hull
and hit the engines...

38:26.651 --> 38:28.312
the energy blast could
feed back into the power-

38:28.386 --> 38:30.684
- Carter!
- We could explode!

38:34.025 --> 38:37.791
<i>- Daniel, Teal'c.
- We're almost there.</i>

38:40.732 --> 38:42.324
Oh, boy.

38:48.740 --> 38:51.402
- This doesn't look good.
- Indeed.

38:51.476 --> 38:54.309
Although, it's quite ironic.

38:54.379 --> 38:57.712
This started because Sam didn't want
to take the Jumper back from a Jaffa patrol.

38:59.250 --> 39:01.081
Look. If we don't make it-

39:05.289 --> 39:08.224
Wait a minute!
You said you like Daniel.

39:08.292 --> 39:11.193
I lied. I just wanted
to get to know you better.

39:11.262 --> 39:14.322
See, usually, I'm a very cautious person,
and I tend to think things-

39:18.736 --> 39:21.671
Jaffa!

39:23.274 --> 39:25.265
Hear me.

39:27.679 --> 39:31.240
Ra is not a god.
You can live free.

39:34.719 --> 39:36.209
I don't think he bought it.

39:40.124 --> 39:42.524
Relinquish your weapons and surrender.

39:46.064 --> 39:47.895
Yeah, I thought you'd say that.

40:19.497 --> 40:22.466
Sam, Jack, it's all clear.
You can come out now.

40:24.368 --> 40:25.858
In a minute.

40:41.385 --> 40:43.615
I can fix that.

40:46.224 --> 40:49.193
<i>Jack, you should say something.</i>

40:49.260 --> 40:52.787
<i>College football is played on Saturdays.
Pro on Sundays.</i>

40:52.864 --> 40:57.494
<i>And there are no fish in my pond.
At all.</i>

40:57.568 --> 40:59.832
<i>Where I fish.</i>

41:02.073 --> 41:03.597
<i>I think that covers it for me.</i>

41:05.710 --> 41:07.075
Is that correct?

41:08.546 --> 41:10.639
If it is, we don't do anything?

41:10.715 --> 41:13.183
Apparently, nothing we did
affected the timeline.

41:13.251 --> 41:17.017
- But we didn't do anything!
- Not yet.

41:17.088 --> 41:19.318
Apparently, we were going to.
Two weeks from now.

41:19.390 --> 41:21.790
But now we don't have to.

41:23.427 --> 41:26.123
Excellent. That's it.

41:26.197 --> 41:28.529
- I like it.
- I'm gonna get this up to the lab.

41:28.599 --> 41:30.760
No! I'll take it.

41:30.835 --> 41:33.770
There's a whole roomful
of geeks up there...

41:33.838 --> 41:35.829
just dying to get their hands on this.

41:37.441 --> 41:40.001
You've got packin' to do.

41:50.555 --> 41:52.853
This is great.

41:52.924 --> 41:57.088
- I told you.
- Can't believe we didn't do it years ago.

41:57.161 --> 42:01.996
Yes. Well, let's not dwell.

42:12.877 --> 42:15.971
Didn't that tape say
they were no fish in your pond?

42:18.850 --> 42:20.841
Close enough.
