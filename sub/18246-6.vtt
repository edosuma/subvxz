00:18.330 --> 00:19.960
<i>The Inbetweeners 1x6
Xmas Party</i>

00:20.244 --> 00:21.884
<i>It was the end of my first term,</i>

00:22.004 --> 00:23.822
<i>and my personal report card read</i>

00:23.942 --> 00:26.920
<i>"Making new friends, C-.
Must try harder."</i>

00:27.691 --> 00:29.641
<i>Being one of the cool gang...</i>

00:31.069 --> 00:32.719
<i>- D.
- Nice badge, dickhead.</i>

00:33.003 --> 00:34.359
<i>Not losing my virginity...</i>

00:36.281 --> 00:38.720
<i>- Will you put your pants on, please?
- A*.</i>

00:39.102 --> 00:40.506
But things were looking up.

00:40.626 --> 00:43.571
<i>I'd been elected chairman of the
school's Christmas prom committee.</i>

00:43.691 --> 00:45.946
<i>All right,
I was the only candidate, but still.</i>

00:46.066 --> 00:49.159
<i>I wanted to look the part,
which meant hiring my first ever suit,</i>

00:49.512 --> 00:52.318
<i>and Simon's dad said
he knew just the place.</i>

00:59.361 --> 01:01.563
Are you sure this is
the best place to hire suits?

01:01.683 --> 01:03.830
I've been coming here for years.

01:04.191 --> 01:05.853
Old Mr Sethi knows me very well.

01:05.973 --> 01:07.989
He'll do you a good deal
if you mention my name.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.956
It looks a bit old-fashioned.

01:10.076 --> 01:13.500
Neil, the stuff in here never
goes out of fashion. It's timeless.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.538
I don't care,
cos I've already bought a suit.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.137
Once, Sethi went mental,

01:17.257 --> 01:19.319
cos I brought a suit back
covered in grass stains.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.073
If you know what I mean.

01:21.193 --> 01:25.012
Blimey, imagine that.
If you got to hire the exact same suit

01:25.132 --> 01:27.072
I was wearing the first time
me and your...

01:27.192 --> 01:29.599
All right, all right. We're going in.

01:31.318 --> 01:34.324
- What do you think?
- Oh, yes. Very nice.

01:34.444 --> 01:38.400
- It is a lovely fit.
- I'm not too sure about the lapels.

01:38.565 --> 01:41.833
- Too jazzy?
- They are a little too jazzy, yes.

01:42.251 --> 01:44.320
Is this the sort of suit
a chairman would wear?

01:44.440 --> 01:46.719
But of course,
definitely for a chairman.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.000
- Here we go.
- I'm the chairman of this committee

01:49.160 --> 01:51.471
that's organising our school's
Christmas prom this year.

01:51.591 --> 01:54.759
That's it. You've now officially told
everyone you've ever laid eyes on.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.033
I just think it's important
that people know.

01:57.153 --> 01:59.319
I'm the DJ.
That's far more important.

01:59.481 --> 02:01.440
I said you might get to DJ.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.086
- Very, very nice.
- I think it's kind of hideous.

02:08.632 --> 02:09.812
Is it velvet?

02:10.256 --> 02:11.560
- Too jazzy?
- Yeah.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.799
Yeah, too jazzy.

02:13.784 --> 02:15.385
And for you, my young friend?

02:15.505 --> 02:18.072
- Shall I find you something also?
- I suppose so.

02:18.192 --> 02:21.133
But I need something special, yeah?
Something's gonna make me stand out.

02:21.253 --> 02:23.439
I'll get you something extra-special,

02:23.817 --> 02:25.439
something just for you.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.439
You said I could fucking DJ.
Don't go back on your word.

02:29.694 --> 02:32.239
Let him DJ.
He's part of my plan to seduce Carli.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.946
What's he gonna do? Hold her down?

02:34.066 --> 02:35.929
I get breathless
every time I think of her,

02:36.049 --> 02:38.119
and when I see her,
my heart does little flips.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.882
- Are you bent?
- Shut up!

02:40.002 --> 02:42.279
It's just that, right then,
you sounded really bent.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.319
- Won't her boyfriend be there?
- Who?

02:44.499 --> 02:45.760
Her boyfriend.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.288
- The massive rugby player.
- Oh, him.

02:48.628 --> 02:50.719
Yeah, no.
I don't think they're going out.

02:50.988 --> 02:52.639
Or if they are, then they aren't really.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.950
I don't know, she never says
that they definitely are,

02:55.070 --> 02:56.881
- so maybe they aren't.
- Yes.

02:57.001 --> 02:59.320
That's the most positive
possible way of looking at it.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.069
Here we are. Just for you. Perfect.

03:05.347 --> 03:06.280
Too jazzy?

03:06.440 --> 03:08.796
<i>With the prom a few days away,
I was stressed.</i>

03:08.916 --> 03:11.125
<i>But I wasn't the only one
with things on my mind.</i>

03:11.245 --> 03:13.039
I think I'm ready for relationship.

03:13.201 --> 03:15.519
You mean you think
you're wanking too much?

03:15.753 --> 03:18.103
- Talking of which...
- Miss Timms...

03:18.591 --> 03:19.741
She's so fit.

03:20.690 --> 03:22.759
It should be illegal
for her to teach biology.

03:23.257 --> 03:26.259
I almost knocked one out there and then
when we did the reproduction system.

03:26.379 --> 03:28.761
As something of an outsider,
I'd say that actually,

03:28.881 --> 03:30.319
she isn't very fit at all.

03:30.629 --> 03:33.159
She's just the only adult female
in the school under 30.

03:33.321 --> 03:36.197
- She is so fit.
- No, she isn't.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.137
I mean, she's fine, but she's no...

03:38.257 --> 03:39.599
She'd definitely get it.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.137
If we could all just concentrate
above the waist for a second,

03:42.257 --> 03:44.559
I need you all at a planning meeting
this lunch.

03:44.721 --> 03:47.339
I've got some brilliant jobs lined up.

03:47.459 --> 03:49.067
- Like what?
- Well...

03:49.187 --> 03:51.399
Giving out the vouchers
that can be exchanged for alcohol.

03:51.568 --> 03:52.568
Shit!

03:52.754 --> 03:55.919
If we control the beer vouchers,
we get the pick of the birds.

03:56.573 --> 03:58.120
The drunk birds.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.559
That sounded just a little bit rapey.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.322
Say what you like, Professor Words.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.599
Thanks to you,
we're gonna be drowning in babes.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.503
I just want the night to be a success.

04:06.623 --> 04:08.073
I've no interest in babes.

04:08.193 --> 04:10.259
That's handy,
cos they've got no interest in you.

04:10.379 --> 04:12.639
Sorry. Who here has pulled
Charlotte Hinchcliffe?

04:13.358 --> 04:14.521
Who? Huh?

04:15.121 --> 04:16.375
Me. That's who.

04:16.641 --> 04:18.574
- She only did it for a bet.
- That's not true.

04:18.694 --> 04:21.326
- Let's not get into all that again.
- It is true.

04:21.446 --> 04:25.041
It's not fucking true. People
don't get fingered for a bet, Jay.

04:25.161 --> 04:27.002
With the possible exception
of your sister.

04:27.122 --> 04:29.599
- Take that back.
- Actually, I do take it back.

04:30.085 --> 04:31.199
But your mum,{ on the other hand,}

04:31.360 --> 04:34.659
she'd probably get fingered
for a packet of biscuits.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.207
- Silence!
- Oh, no!

04:40.719 --> 04:43.327
<i>Obviously no-one cool
wanted to help organise the prom,</i>

04:43.447 --> 04:45.386
<i>so when it came to
recruiting a crack team,</i>

04:45.506 --> 04:47.856
<i>I wasn't exactly spoiled for choice.</i>

04:49.174 --> 04:51.919
<i>But while there may be no "I" in team,
luckily there was a "me".</i>

04:52.626 --> 04:55.635
<i>And if I was to stop these
morons from screwing up my big night,</i>

04:55.755 --> 04:57.826
<i>every fine detail had to be planned.</i>

04:57.946 --> 04:59.760
Right. Welcome.

05:00.112 --> 05:02.439
As you all know,
this is the first ever Christmas prom.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.530
Two things are gonna make
this event successful:

05:04.650 --> 05:07.002
teamwork and exceptional leadership.

05:07.590 --> 05:10.635
The first thing we need to discuss
is the agenda and how that...

05:10.755 --> 05:12.799
- Yes, John?
- Are we gonna have food?

05:12.961 --> 05:14.311
Yep. Yep, we will.

05:14.822 --> 05:17.687
If you look at the agenda,
that's item four, so we'll get to that.

05:17.807 --> 05:19.296
I think we should have food.

05:19.416 --> 05:22.456
And I was wondering what type
everyone thought we should have.

05:22.576 --> 05:26.007
As I say, that is on the agenda,
so we'll get to that.

05:26.131 --> 05:28.079
Lasagne's nice, and so are burgers.

05:28.469 --> 05:31.160
You don't need a plate for burgers,
which gives them an edge on lasagne.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.879
Yes, John, please. We'll get to that.

05:34.041 --> 05:36.014
But you can eat burgers off a plate,
too.

05:36.134 --> 05:37.239
Listen, lard-arse.

05:37.401 --> 05:40.256
There will be food so shut the fuck up
so we can get this over with!

05:40.376 --> 05:42.439
- I just wanted you all...
- Shut up!

05:45.035 --> 05:46.474
Right. Right.

05:49.379 --> 05:51.093
Item one. Venue.

05:52.071 --> 05:54.359
We're having it in the school hall,
obviously.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.294
Item two, band.

05:56.670 --> 05:59.279
- We don't need a band. I'm DJing.
- After half ten.

05:59.629 --> 06:01.239
I should be DJing the whole thing!

06:02.259 --> 06:04.324
- They're booked now.
- You're shit at this.

06:04.444 --> 06:06.888
I'd be much better.
I've organised hundreds of parties.

06:07.008 --> 06:10.512
This is the first ever Christmas prom,
not a chimps' tea party.

06:10.632 --> 06:12.591
What we want is a good,
structured evening.

06:12.711 --> 06:14.930
What we want is a big mucky disco
and a piss-up.

06:15.050 --> 06:16.886
- Hang on.
- When have you organised parties?

06:17.006 --> 06:18.959
- All the time.
- I've known you for ten years

06:19.121 --> 06:21.152
and I have never seen
you organise a party.

06:21.272 --> 06:23.387
Bollocks. What about
my birthday party last year?

06:23.507 --> 06:26.515
- Your mum organised that.
- Yeah, under my supervision.

06:26.635 --> 06:28.831
- And that was a wicked party.
- I fingered a bird.

06:28.951 --> 06:32.240
See? And also,
I organise the Caravan Club parties.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.359
Remember,
we have been to a Caravan Club party.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.386
- And it was shit.
- I fingered a bird.

06:36.506 --> 06:39.771
- There you go!
- Look, Jay, now's not the time.

06:40.255 --> 06:42.639
- Item three.
- Seriously, Will, why are we here?

06:42.800 --> 06:44.510
You've clearly decided it all already.

06:44.630 --> 06:47.679
No, I haven't. There's still loads
I need your help with.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.239
- Like what?
- Like who cleans up the next day.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.461
- What item's that?
- 28.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.888
For Christ's sake, just get on with it.

06:56.008 --> 06:58.265
- Item four, food.
- Good.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.830
She did it as a bet.
One more time, that's not true.

07:01.950 --> 07:03.814
Say what you like, I know it was a bet.

07:03.934 --> 07:05.621
- Ask her.
- I will.

07:05.741 --> 07:08.075
There she is over there.
Go ask her now.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.451
I'm not gonna ask her now.
I'll ask her later.

07:10.571 --> 07:13.221
- Or tomorrow at the prom.
- Right, course!

07:14.549 --> 07:17.440
Right. Here goes. Phase one.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.106
Carli!

07:21.127 --> 07:23.692
- Hi, Simon.
- All right, sick-boy boner?

07:25.383 --> 07:27.826
Listen, this dance,
you are going, aren't you?

07:27.946 --> 07:29.096
Great. Great.

07:29.606 --> 07:32.239
- Maybe we could go together?
- I could do with a lift, yeah, thanks.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.958
Right, a lift. Yeah.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.985
Tom's car's broken,
so that would be perfect.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.039
Great. Got to get here early
to help Will set up,

07:38.161 --> 07:40.724
- so I'll pick you up about four.
- Four?

07:40.844 --> 07:43.679
You want me to go to a prom
that starts at eight at four o'clock?

07:43.840 --> 07:46.325
- That's the time I'll be getting there.
- There'll be loads to do.

07:46.445 --> 07:48.979
So, what?
I could turn up in my evening dress

07:49.099 --> 07:51.328
four hours early
and help you blow up balloons?

07:51.448 --> 07:53.076
You could help scrub the floors.

07:53.196 --> 07:55.439
It might be fun. You know, all together.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.334
- Are you mentally ill?
- Good one.

07:58.454 --> 08:01.450
Tell you what, I'll see you there.
In the evening.

08:01.570 --> 08:03.959
Great. Great. I'll see you there, then.

08:04.711 --> 08:06.772
You know, since he's met you,

08:07.361 --> 08:09.633
- he's become much more of a dick.
- Really?

08:09.753 --> 08:13.134
He does seem to think more and,
like, express himself.

08:13.254 --> 08:16.359
- Isn't that a good thing?
- - Does it look like a good thing?

08:24.011 --> 08:27.159
- I'm charging you for the chips.
- I never had chips!

08:31.237 --> 08:32.159
Right, then.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.640
So tomorrow is your Christmas party,

08:34.760 --> 08:39.089
or prom, if you will insist on speaking
like our transatlantic cousins.

08:40.039 --> 08:42.448
Myself and Miss Timms will attend

08:42.698 --> 08:45.349
to make sure you enjoy yourselves
sensibly.

08:45.935 --> 08:48.360
Now, obviously we want you to have fun,

08:48.818 --> 08:51.600
but in order
to make it enjoyable for everyone,

08:51.760 --> 08:53.280
we have a few rules.

08:53.698 --> 08:58.120
One, everyone will get
two alcoholic drink tokens and no more.

08:58.806 --> 09:02.800
Frankly, the last thing I want
is to be cleaning up your dreadful sick,

09:03.320 --> 09:06.799
or even worse, you putting your arms
around me and telling me that

09:06.961 --> 09:09.399
I'm, "All right for a teacher",
and that you love me.

09:10.247 --> 09:14.520
Two, this is a school dance
and not the last days of Rome.

09:17.305 --> 09:20.319
What I mean by this is no heavy petting.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.559
And I will be the judge
of what constitutes heavy.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.699
- Pervert.
- I heard that.

09:24.819 --> 09:28.077
And if I see anything
that I consider too much,

09:28.400 --> 09:30.247
you will be sent home.

09:31.961 --> 09:34.560
Is that clear? Is that clear?

09:35.138 --> 09:36.138
Yes, sir.

09:37.211 --> 09:39.043
Good. Have a nice evening.

09:39.630 --> 09:42.301
I'll leave you in the hands of the
chairman of the organising committee,

09:42.421 --> 09:44.697
God help you, William MacKenzie.

09:46.094 --> 09:48.302
- Thanks, Phil. Now...
- Sorry?

09:49.875 --> 09:51.119
Thanks for that, Phil.

09:51.413 --> 09:52.160
Phil?!

09:55.572 --> 09:58.439
It's just cos the dance is outside
of school time so I assumed...

09:58.823 --> 10:02.529
You assumed wrong, Will.
Very wrong.

10:02.893 --> 10:03.867
Sorry.

10:06.591 --> 10:08.439
- Right, then...
- Say my name properly.

10:11.121 --> 10:12.000
Mr Gilbert.

10:12.981 --> 10:14.239
Say thank you.

10:15.446 --> 10:18.119
- Thank you.
- Say, "Thank you, Mr Gilbert".

10:18.487 --> 10:19.719
Thank you, Mr Gilbert.

10:20.425 --> 10:21.160
Better.

10:29.211 --> 10:32.271
Just a few things to make sure
it runs smoothly,

10:32.391 --> 10:35.239
- I've got the schedules here...
- I've not forgotten about you.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.960
I'll be watching you tomorrow.

10:37.121 --> 10:38.953
And if I see you
anywhere near Charlotte,

10:39.073 --> 10:41.199
I'll rip your fucking throat out.

10:41.561 --> 10:42.935
Have a nice time.

10:45.330 --> 10:46.739
That's good.

10:48.281 --> 10:51.393
<i>Brilliant! It wasn't just my
reputation on the line at the prom,</i>

10:51.513 --> 10:52.963
<i>now it was my life.</i>

10:55.177 --> 10:57.603
<i>It was the moment of truth.
Prom night had arrived,</i>

10:57.890 --> 11:00.354
<i>and as I watched my crack team
setting things up,</i>

11:00.474 --> 11:02.403
<i>it's fair to say I was shitting myself.</i>

11:02.687 --> 11:05.478
David, don't lean on that,
it'll come down!

11:06.013 --> 11:08.089
Who's written the toilet signs?

11:08.547 --> 11:10.923
- Where are the toilet signs?!
- We're in the school.

11:11.084 --> 11:13.544
Everyone knows where the toilets are.
They piss in them every day.

11:13.664 --> 11:17.245
Not everyone will know.
We're meant to have signs. Pen! Pen!

11:18.419 --> 11:19.640
It's fucking run out.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.208
How can this be happening?
Tonight is a fucking disaster.

11:22.328 --> 11:25.308
It's fine. It's all fine. It looks good.

11:25.428 --> 11:27.769
Look, people are gonna judge tonight,
and therefore me,

11:27.889 --> 11:30.204
as either a huge success
or a massive failure.

11:30.364 --> 11:32.578
You've got balloons,
you're already one up on any event

11:32.698 --> 11:34.644
the school's ever had before.
Just relax.

11:34.764 --> 11:36.709
It's very hard
to relax knowing that Donovan

11:36.829 --> 11:39.163
might very well kick the shit
out of me at some point.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.907
Right. That makes much more sense.

11:41.027 --> 11:43.437
How come you're so calm?
I thought you'd be shitting yourself

11:43.557 --> 11:45.521
- about your plan to get Carli.
- I'm fine.

11:45.641 --> 11:47.803
Jay's got his end sorted
and I know exactly what to say.

11:47.964 --> 11:50.078
Right.
Are you sure you should trust Jay

11:50.198 --> 11:52.272
with what could be
the tenderest moment of your life?

11:52.392 --> 11:54.695
Yeah, yeah, he'll be fine.
It's a good plan.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.091
And can it be worse
than puking on her brother's head?

11:57.211 --> 11:59.790
Maybe. You haven't told me
what it is yet.

12:07.830 --> 12:09.795
What the fuck are you wearing?

12:10.371 --> 12:12.883
Oh, my God!
And I thought our suits were shit.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.443
Your cock, it looks so tiny.

12:15.605 --> 12:17.650
- It's like an acorn!
- Have you gone mental?

12:17.770 --> 12:19.584
This is cool.
Look, I saw it in Nuts.

12:19.704 --> 12:21.895
Girls will fancy me because I stand out.

12:22.015 --> 12:24.043
You'll stand out because
your cock is minuscule.

12:24.204 --> 12:27.007
- Will you stop looking at my cock?
- Mate, I think that's brave.

12:27.127 --> 12:28.843
- Really brave.
- It's so shit.

12:29.368 --> 12:32.627
Actually, maybe I'd better go
stick a couple of socks down there.

12:32.747 --> 12:35.043
- Any jobs for me?
- Wash your hands afterwards.

12:35.305 --> 12:36.244
Gotcha.

12:38.265 --> 12:40.081
Will, where's the toilets?

12:41.472 --> 12:42.741
For fuck's sake!

12:45.267 --> 12:47.483
<i>Despite being organised
by my team of geeks,</i>

12:47.644 --> 12:50.940
<i>it actually looked like people
were enjoying the party.</i>

13:15.082 --> 13:17.148
<i>Mind you, I couldn't afford to relax.</i>

13:17.268 --> 13:18.844
John! John!

13:20.080 --> 13:21.723
Stop eating the burgers!

13:26.517 --> 13:28.595
- He's stressed.
- Yeah.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.242
And to be honest,
I think it's a pretty good party.

13:32.362 --> 13:33.960
And it just got even better.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.323
Here's Miss Timms.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.146
She actually looks quite fit.

13:37.266 --> 13:38.266
Very fit.

13:42.205 --> 13:43.403
Very fit indeed.

13:48.317 --> 13:50.585
I'm on soon, are you ready, Si?
Have you found Carli yet?

13:50.705 --> 13:52.835
- Not yet, but she'll be here soon.
- Another drink?

13:52.955 --> 13:55.648
Better not. I don't want a repeat
of what happened last time.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.083
- You OK with the plan?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm on it.

13:58.203 --> 13:59.822
You've got the timings and everything?

13:59.942 --> 14:02.123
- To the second.
- Please don't fuck it up.

14:02.284 --> 14:04.803
I won't fuck it up!
Go on, go and find her.

14:05.599 --> 14:07.043
Right. Here goes.

14:11.957 --> 14:13.613
<i>As Neil was about to discover,</i>

14:13.733 --> 14:15.520
<i>the problem with
drinking for Dutch courage</i>

14:15.640 --> 14:19.090
<i>is the next level of drunk
up from that is Dutch dickhead.</i>

14:27.951 --> 14:29.363
<i>So far, so good.</i>

14:29.524 --> 14:30.711
<i>The band rocked,</i>

14:30.831 --> 14:33.056
<i>people largely found
the toilets without a sign,</i>

14:33.176 --> 14:36.004
<i>and best of all,
my throat remained un-ripped out.</i>

14:36.822 --> 14:39.404
<i>Now all I had to worry
about was Jay's Djing.</i>

14:45.310 --> 14:48.884
This isn't on the approved playlist!
No-one likes this one, Jay.

14:49.044 --> 14:51.163
That's it, it's a disaster.

14:51.325 --> 14:52.575
Hello, stranger.

14:54.089 --> 14:54.841
Hello.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.084
Is Mark not around?

14:57.244 --> 15:00.003
Why? Were you gonna ask him to dance?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.627
No. No, I wasn't.

15:03.833 --> 15:05.277
- You all right?
- Yeah.

15:05.397 --> 15:07.152
I{ just} don't know whether
this is any good.{ I mean,}

15:07.272 --> 15:10.530
- what makes a cool party?
- You and your bloody party, Will.

15:10.650 --> 15:13.402
- It's great, just enjoy yourself.
- You're just being nice.

15:13.522 --> 15:15.531
Why would I want to be nice to you, eh?

15:15.651 --> 15:18.795
Trust me, I've been to loads of shit
parties and this really isn't one.

15:18.915 --> 15:20.265
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.563
You've done well. For a geek.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.233
Come on, we're going for a dance.

15:27.205 --> 15:28.843
I don't really dance, to be honest.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.283
And I've... I've got stuff to sort out.

15:32.786 --> 15:34.883
Fine. But you owe me a dance later.
Agreed?

15:35.229 --> 15:36.273
Agreed.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.333
Charlotte?

15:38.962 --> 15:39.962
Yeah?

15:40.266 --> 15:42.569
- You know us?
- Yeah.

15:43.873 --> 15:45.163
I wasn't a bet, was I?

15:51.012 --> 15:54.298
Just enjoy your party,
we'll have a dance later. OK?

16:00.748 --> 16:01.844
Give us a burger.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.774
- You could say please.
- Just give me one.

16:03.894 --> 16:05.693
I've got to be back up there
in 3 minutes.

16:05.813 --> 16:08.464
Not until you say please.
Manners cost nothing.

16:08.584 --> 16:10.843
For fuck's sake.
Can I have a burger, please?

16:11.276 --> 16:12.402
Of course you can.

16:12.522 --> 16:16.172
- Would you like ketchup on that?
- Yeah, go on, then. Please.

16:16.604 --> 16:19.091
- Your DJing seems to be going well.
- Yeah, it's all right.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.426
- Made a few cock-ups.
- No-one's noticed.

16:21.546 --> 16:24.091
It's weird, but...
I feel better when I'm doing it.

16:24.211 --> 16:26.723
- Kind of not so tense.
- My counsellor used to say that

16:27.022 --> 16:29.523
frustration often comes
from wanting to be noticed.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.255
Yeah, that's it.

16:35.456 --> 16:38.483
- It's probably why I exaggerate a bit.
- To feel special?

16:38.644 --> 16:41.533
It's like sometimes I feel like
the kids here don't pay attention to me.

16:41.653 --> 16:43.321
Like I'm so dumb, I don't matter.

16:43.604 --> 16:46.215
I guess making a few things up
at least makes them notice.

16:46.335 --> 16:49.385
Do you fancy a beer?
I've still got my two tokens.

16:49.505 --> 16:51.031
I don't mind sharing.

16:51.151 --> 16:53.084
Yeah, cheers.

16:53.688 --> 16:56.563
I understand how you feel, you know.
Back in a MO.

16:57.446 --> 16:59.968
- You're DJing, aren't you?
- Yeah.

17:00.088 --> 17:02.603
I used to DJ at a top nightclub
in Ibiza.

17:03.680 --> 17:07.507
I could probably get you a regular spot.
You look like you're really into it.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.163
It's all about being sensitive.

17:09.645 --> 17:12.405
I find it hard to trust,
but when it's just me and the music,

17:12.525 --> 17:13.403
I'm sorted.

17:13.970 --> 17:15.771
- Are you bent?
- What?

17:16.028 --> 17:19.042
Just right then,
you sounded really, really bent.

17:20.233 --> 17:22.486
I heard. Do you want
to come up to the decks with me?

17:22.606 --> 17:24.282
- All right.
- Got them!

17:28.095 --> 17:30.803
You didn't say please.
What about opening up and trusting?

17:31.700 --> 17:33.462
Fuck off, you fat wanker.

17:40.693 --> 17:41.538
Carli?

17:42.899 --> 17:43.746
Carli.

17:44.463 --> 17:45.296
Simon.

17:45.601 --> 17:47.683
- You got here all right, then?
- Looks like it.

17:48.618 --> 17:50.813
- Where's Tom?
- That dick!

17:51.177 --> 17:52.848
He's out with his rugby mates.

17:52.968 --> 17:55.031
I left them {just }as
they were gonna start drinking beer

17:55.151 --> 17:58.323
- out of each other's bum cracks.
- Right. That's a bit weird, isn't it?

17:58.484 --> 18:01.764
- I don't care, I'm not interested.
- Right. Great.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.481
So did you want anything in particular?

18:05.601 --> 18:07.912
Yeah, I did want something.

18:13.727 --> 18:15.525
Why has the music stopped?

18:16.340 --> 18:18.618
I stopped it. Because...

18:19.525 --> 18:21.075
I need to say that...

18:22.001 --> 18:23.511
I just wanted to say to you...

18:23.631 --> 18:25.541
Are you going to ask me
to finger myself again?

18:25.661 --> 18:27.390
God, no. No.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.024
I just need to say that...

18:32.170 --> 18:35.083
Simon, I've had enough
of dickheads today. What is it?

18:35.244 --> 18:37.101
Why are you being so weird?

18:41.674 --> 18:44.204
- No. No, it's nothing.
- Nothing.

18:44.784 --> 18:46.616
I was gonna say something,
but it's gone now.

18:46.736 --> 18:48.964
- What were you gonna say?
- I was gonna say that...

18:49.084 --> 18:51.564
- What the fuck is Neil doing?
- Come here!

18:51.725 --> 18:53.275
Oh, go on!

18:53.395 --> 18:56.920
- Neil, what are you doing?
- I love you. Please.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.797
- Boner!
- Boner!

19:00.463 --> 19:01.244
Oh, God!

19:03.150 --> 19:06.442
Every year. Every year,
someone has a pop, don't they?

19:06.765 --> 19:09.915
Come on, Sutherland.
Let's get you a glass of water.

19:11.921 --> 19:15.089
What's the problem? I wanted you
to come here with me tonight.

19:15.209 --> 19:17.096
You decide to go out
with your friends instead.

19:17.216 --> 19:18.467
What's wrong with that?

19:18.587 --> 19:21.466
What do you mean?{, what's wrong with that? }
I had to come here on my own.

19:25.244 --> 19:27.280
I fucking warned you
about talking to Charlotte.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.657
- You are taking the piss!
- I didn't, I wasn't!

19:29.777 --> 19:32.527
She came over to me!
Mr Gilbert! Mr Gilbert!

19:33.958 --> 19:35.108
Put him down!

19:35.885 --> 19:37.643
- Or what?
- Yeah, leave him alone.

19:37.804 --> 19:40.833
- He ain't even done nothing.
- Don't be a dickhead, Donovan.

19:40.953 --> 19:42.653
Yeah, fuck off, Donovan.

19:42.773 --> 19:45.763
Leave the speccy short-arse alone.
He's organised a good party.

19:45.924 --> 19:48.483
Yeah, Briefcase is all right, Donovan.
Don't be a tit.

19:52.339 --> 19:53.372
Charlotte!

19:55.528 --> 19:58.564
Thanks. That was really kind.

19:59.102 --> 20:02.345
And really great.
I sort of knew that I'd have to say

20:02.465 --> 20:04.683
a few words of thanks
at some point tonight.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.529
So I've prepared a little speech...

20:11.724 --> 20:12.583
Again.

20:13.604 --> 20:14.602
Of course.

20:21.203 --> 20:22.364
Well done, children.

20:22.524 --> 20:25.830
A fairly innocuous jamboree
of adolescent nonsense.

20:26.527 --> 20:29.658
Fear not, the relationships that
some of you have entered into tonight,

20:29.778 --> 20:31.780
they may seem like everything now,

20:31.900 --> 20:34.407
but they'll be over
in a matter of weeks.

20:34.527 --> 20:38.377
Now, if we can just make it
home without tagging people's property.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.236
I may go to bed relatively hate-free.

20:46.764 --> 20:50.427
You two! Do you want me
to fetch up my dinner? Go home!

20:55.253 --> 20:57.596
I'm allowed to enjoy this, aren't I?

20:57.716 --> 21:00.215
Yeah. Well done, mate. Top night.

21:00.589 --> 21:01.835
Tonight, I win.

21:02.276 --> 21:04.658
Party was good,
Charlotte probably not a bet,

21:04.778 --> 21:07.222
and best of all,
Donovan didn't beat me up.

21:07.342 --> 21:09.843
That last one you can only enjoy
over the holiday.

21:09.963 --> 21:11.713
He'll kill you next term.

21:12.279 --> 21:15.163
- Did you really enjoy it, though?
- Yeah, I had a laugh.

21:15.324 --> 21:16.733
Why did you think I hadn't?

21:16.853 --> 21:19.538
You know.
It didn't exactly go to plan with Carli.

21:20.888 --> 21:24.030
I was standing there,
ready to say all this stuff to her,

21:24.150 --> 21:26.100
and it just wouldn't come out.

21:27.017 --> 21:28.224
And then I thought,

21:28.344 --> 21:30.034
am I really that bothered?

21:30.154 --> 21:32.033
And then Neil tried to fuck the teacher.

21:32.153 --> 21:33.218
Leave me alone.

21:33.338 --> 21:35.323
Honestly, she looked like
she was gonna slap you.

21:35.484 --> 21:37.443
But I think your erection
scared her off.

21:37.604 --> 21:40.603
- What were you thinking?
- I dunno. I think it was the suit.

21:40.776 --> 21:43.972
- It was definitely too jazzy.
- I thought Miss Timms would like it.

21:44.092 --> 21:46.181
Even though she's 30,
is going out with Gilbert

21:46.301 --> 21:48.095
and would go to prison for snogging you?

21:48.215 --> 21:49.763
Gilbert was OK about it, actually.

21:50.021 --> 21:52.033
Are you looking forward
to biology next term?

21:52.153 --> 21:54.468
- Not really.
- Should be interesting.

21:55.684 --> 21:57.805
Guess who just got
a blowy behind the decks?

21:57.925 --> 21:59.844
- Not you, obviously.
- Guess again.

21:59.964 --> 22:01.741
Jay, you're my mate.

22:02.006 --> 22:04.440
But please, for once, just don't lie.

22:04.774 --> 22:06.589
- What happened?
- Blowy.

22:06.764 --> 22:08.363
I said, "Please don't lie."

22:09.280 --> 22:12.084
All right, all right.
She gave me a hand job, not a blowy.

22:13.976 --> 22:15.576
- I knew it was bollocks.
- What?

22:15.696 --> 22:18.032
I just got a hand job
on the school stage.

22:18.152 --> 22:20.030
- That's better than any of you.
- Bollocks.

22:20.150 --> 22:21.907
It's already come down from a blow job.

22:22.027 --> 22:24.131
You'll be telling us
it was outside the trousers next.

22:24.251 --> 22:26.032
- It was!
- That doesn't count!

22:26.152 --> 22:27.843
That's not even a hand job, then!

22:28.339 --> 22:30.472
What has just happened there, my friend,

22:30.592 --> 22:33.432
- is you've spunked yourself.
- That counts.

22:33.764 --> 22:34.803
Doesn't count.

22:35.399 --> 22:37.779
I haven't cleaned my cock yet, so...

22:38.028 --> 22:39.203
Does this count?

22:40.305 --> 22:46.354
