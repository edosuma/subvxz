WEBVTT

00:03.307 --> 00:05.353
OWEN, PARK THE PLANE.
WE'RE LEAVING.

00:05.353 --> 00:07.181
CLAUDIA, DO YOU NEED
A RIDE OR DON'T YOU?

00:07.181 --> 00:08.356
YES, I NEED YOU.
I'M LATE.

00:08.356 --> 00:09.792
JUST AS SOON
AS I'M DRESSED.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.576
WELL, THEN, HURRY UP,

00:11.576 --> 00:13.535
'CAUSE DIANA'S
ABOUT TO LOSE IT,
AND OWEN'S--

00:13.535 --> 00:15.189
OWEN, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:15.189 --> 00:17.321
KAMIKAZE FLYING
DOWN THE STEPS
WHEN I PASSED HIM.

00:17.321 --> 00:18.540
HEY. I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.150
I CAME TO GIVE THIS BACK.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.673
WHAT?

00:21.673 --> 00:23.588
I FOUND A BUNCH
OF APARTMENT LEADS
IN THE PAPER.

00:23.588 --> 00:25.764
SOME IN THE REALM
OF REALITY PRICE-WISE.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.375
ACTUALLY, IT'S--
IT'S KIND OF EXCITING.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.682
MY VERY OWN PLACE
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE...

00:30.682 --> 00:33.903
WELL, ANYWAY, UM...

00:33.903 --> 00:35.470
CAN I GIVE A HUG
HELLO/GOOD-BYE?

00:35.470 --> 00:36.427
YEAH.

00:37.863 --> 00:38.864
HEY.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.562
HEY.

00:40.562 --> 00:42.694
I JUST CAME BY
TO PICK UP MY MAIL,
AND, UH...

00:42.694 --> 00:44.131
DROP OFF THIS.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.046
HEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO, UH--

00:46.046 --> 00:47.308
Kirsten:
OK, I GOTTA GO.
UM...

00:47.308 --> 00:48.657
WILL YOU SAY GOOD-BYE
TO CLAUD FOR ME?

00:48.657 --> 00:49.919
YEAH.OK.

00:49.919 --> 00:50.920
BYE, GRIFFIN.

00:50.920 --> 00:51.921
BYE.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.009
IS THIS YOURS?

00:53.009 --> 00:54.663
WHAT?

00:54.663 --> 00:56.230
THIS, UH,
THE REAL ESTATE SECTION?

00:56.230 --> 00:58.058
COULD I BORROW THIS?

00:58.058 --> 01:00.495
I COULD PROBABLY
SWING SOME OF THESE
IF I SELL SOME MORE! BLOOD.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.323
GRIFFIN, LISTEN,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FIND A NEW PLACE.

01:02.323 --> 01:03.976
YOU CAN CRASH
IN THE SHED.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.804
NO. THANKS. THAT'S--

01:05.804 --> 01:08.024
NO, REALLY.
JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE NOT WANTED.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.679
OK? 'CAUSE AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENED WITH JULIA--

01:10.679 --> 01:13.116
LOOK, NO,
THAT'S REALLY NICE.
IT IS. BUT, UH,

01:13.116 --> 01:14.770
I'M ACTUALLY
ABOUT THIS CLOSE

01:14.770 --> 01:17.425
FROM HAVING
A REAL LIFE, SO, UH...
I GOTTA GO.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.600
THANK YOU.
OK.

01:24.867 --> 01:28.523
THAT KID ON THE STEPS
SAYS YOU'RE CHARLIE SALINGER?

01:28.523 --> 01:30.307
YEAH. WHAT,
YOU'RE GONNA DROP OFF
YOUR KEY, TOO?

01:44.278 --> 01:46.280
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

01:46.280 --> 01:47.890
WHAT?

01:47.890 --> 01:49.674
IT'S A SUBPOENA.

01:49.674 --> 01:52.460

HERE EVERY NIGHT SINCE...

02:58.569 --> 03:00.267
WHAT'S TODAY?
EVERY NIGHT SINCE FRIDAY?

03:00.267 --> 03:01.877
I JUST FIGURED.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.922
SINCE FRIDAY?

03:03.922 --> 03:05.402
VENERDI?

03:05.402 --> 03:08.797

YOU'D BE STAYING TONIGHT.

NO, I'M NOT.
I CAN'T. I MEAN...

03:11.103 --> 03:14.106
WOW. I DIDN'T EVEN
REALIZE...

03:14.106 --> 03:17.022
GUESS I'VE KIND OF BEEN
AVOIDING THAT PLACE, HUH?

03:17.022 --> 03:19.895
WELL, THAT'S OK, JULE.

03:19.895 --> 03:22.898
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S--IT'S MY LIFE.

03:22.898 --> 03:25.640
I CAN'T JUST SLIP INTO
LIVING BACK HERE.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.903
I GUESS WHOEVER...

03:27.903 --> 03:29.557
WHATEVER'S AT SCHOOL,

03:29.557 --> 03:31.559
I KIND OF GOTTA DEAL
WITH BEING THERE, HUH?

03:31.559 --> 03:33.735
SO I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN I SEE YOU.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.260
GRAZIE BENE.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.874
YOUR LAWYER--

03:42.874 --> 03:45.399
HE TREATED ME LIKE I WAS
SOME KIND OF CRIMINAL, BAILEY,

03:45.399 --> 03:47.009
AND I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.402
YES, I KNOW. I KNOW.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.055
HE GRILLED ME, TOO.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.666
BUT THAT'S THE DRILL,
SARAH.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.624
HE'S GOTTA PREPARE YOU
FOR THE COURTROOM.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.539
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I STILL
WANT TO KILL HIM.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.237
AND YOU, TOO, A LITTLE.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.716
YEAH, WELL,
DON'T BE MAD AT ME.
BE MAD AT CHARLIE.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.065
HE'S THE ONE
WHO'S MAKING ME DO THIS.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.545
YEAH, I GUESS.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.158
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

04:06.158 --> 04:08.465
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WITH ME ON THIS.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.380
BAILEY, I AM.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.122
I'M WITH YOU
ON OWEN LIVING HERE,
COMPLETELY,

04:13.122 --> 04:15.211
BUT SUING YOUR BROTHER
TO GET HIM?

04:15.211 --> 04:16.778
CAN YOU THINK
OF A BETTER WAY
TO MAKE HIM LISTEN?

04:16.778 --> 04:19.389
IF YOU HAVE A BETTER WAY,
THEN TELL ME, SARAH,

04:19.389 --> 04:21.652
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO BE DOING THIS...AT ALL.

04:21.652 --> 04:24.655
I DON'T KNOW, BAILEY.

04:24.655 --> 04:27.092
I'VE JUST--
I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE.

04:27.092 --> 04:29.443
MY PARENTS--
WHEN THEY GOT DIVORCED,

04:29.443 --> 04:31.096
IT WASN'T EVEN MESSY.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.489
I MEAN, THEY AGREED
ON EVERYTHING,

04:32.489 --> 04:35.057
UNTIL THEY
OPENED THEIR MOUTHS
IN FRONT OF A JUDGE

04:35.057 --> 04:36.841
AND SOME LAWYERS,
AND IT ALL FELL APART.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.930
I MEAN, THEY'RE STILL
NOT SPEAKING.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.455
AND THEY WERE FIGHTING
OVER FURNITURE, BAILEY.
YOU'RE FIGHTING OVER OWEN.

04:41.455 --> 04:44.066
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. OK?

04:44.066 --> 04:48.070
AND SO IF--
IF PEOPLE'S FEELINGS GET HURT,

04:48.070 --> 04:50.638
THEN THAT'S WHAT
HAS TO HAPPEN.

04:50.638 --> 04:54.032
EVEN IF IT MEANS
HE NEVER FORGIVES YOU?

04:54.032 --> 04:56.383
HE'LL GET OVER THIS,
SARAH. HE WILL.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.775
HE'S AN ADULT.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.342
WE ALL ARE.

04:59.342 --> 05:03.215
AND--AND THAT'S THE POINT.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.479
OWEN IS JUST A KID.

05:05.479 --> 05:08.220
AND IF HE DOESN'T GET
THE ATTENTION
THAT HE NEEDS RIGHT NOW,

05:08.220 --> 05:10.571
HE'LL NEVER GET OVER THAT.

05:10.571 --> 05:13.225
HE WON'T.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.402
[RUSSIAN ACCENT]
NOW YOU HAVE SEEN
THE KITCHEN.

05:15.402 --> 05:18.056
IT'S NOT PERFECT,
BUT YOU CAN COOK THERE.

05:18.056 --> 05:21.886
AND THE--THE BATHROOM'S
NOT PERFECT,
BUT EVERYTHING WORK.

05:21.886 --> 05:24.236
AH, WELL, THE RENT'S
A LITTLE STEEP,

05:24.236 --> 05:25.629
BUT I LIKE IT.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.283
YOU LIKE IT NOW?

05:27.283 --> 05:29.938
THEN YOU SHOULD WALK
UP AND DOWN THE BLOCK.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.941
THE PEOPLE, THEY SAY,
"GOOD MORNING, MRS. KRANTHER,"
IF IT'S MORNING,

05:32.941 --> 05:35.552
OR, "GOOD AFTERNOON,
MRS. KRANTHER,"

05:35.552 --> 05:36.945
IF IT'S AFTERNOON.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.599
YEAH, THAT'S NICE.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.602
IF, UH, YOU KNOW,
IF IT JUST WASN'T
FOR THE RENT.

05:41.602 --> 05:45.214
YOU KNOW, MY HUSBAND AND I,
WE HAVE BEEN HERE 25 YEARS.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.564
HE WAS APARTMENT MANAGER,
AND THEN WE SAVED UP

05:47.564 --> 05:49.218
AND WE BOUGHT IT.

05:49.218 --> 05:51.568
OH. SO MAYBE
I TALK TO HIM
ABOUT THE RENT?

05:51.568 --> 05:53.135
ME. YOU TALK TO ME.

05:53.135 --> 05:56.268
MY HUSBAND AND MONEY
IS NOT A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.053
Mr. Kranther:
GO AHEAD, FLUSH IT.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.882
YOU DON'T KNOW A THING
UNTIL YOU FLUSH.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.623
THERE HE IS.

06:02.623 --> 06:05.713
HE'S SHOWING THE PLACE
TO SOMEBODY ELSE, MR. GRIFFIN.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.455
OOH. OOH.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.892
VIEWS FROM THE BEDROOM--
THAT'S NICE.

06:10.892 --> 06:13.895
NEVER MIND THE VIEWS.
LOOK AT THESE WALLS.

06:13.895 --> 06:16.637
WELL, YOU GOTTA HAVE
AN APARTMENT WITH WALLS.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.247
NO, I MEAN WALLS WALLS.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.553
LIKE THEY USED TO MAKE.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.424
[PATS WALL]

06:21.424 --> 06:23.557
IT'S GOOD APARTMENT
FOR YOU, NO?
YOU THINK SO?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.210
YES, I DO.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.256
AND YOU THINK
THE PRICE IS FAIR?

06:27.256 --> 06:29.780
YEAH, I DO.
SHALL I--SHALL I TALK
TO MRS. KRANTHER ABOUT--

06:29.780 --> 06:31.173
NO, NO, NO.
FORGET MY WIFE.

06:31.173 --> 06:32.783
WHEN IT
COMES TO BUSINESS,

06:32.783 --> 06:34.437
SHE'S IN A WORLD
OF HER OWN.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.484
YOU WILL FILL OUT
THE APPLICATION
AND GIVE IT TO ME.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.834
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SO MUCH,
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE
LIVING IN ITALY.

06:39.834 --> 06:43.141
YEAH,
EXCEPT FOR THE FOOD.
OK, I HAVE BEEN IN ITALY--

06:43.141 --> 06:44.969
JUST WHEN I THINK
I'M OVER YOU.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.584
UM, HEY, I'LL SEE YA.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.674
NED, I REALLY
DON'T THINK--

06:53.674 --> 06:54.414
SOMETHING HAPPENED

06:54.414 --> 06:55.458
WITH RICHIE.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.983
WHAT ABOUT RICHIE?

06:58.983 --> 07:02.900
WAIT, DON'T TELL ME.
I DON'T WANT TO
HEAR ABOUT RICHIE.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.336
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT ANYTHING.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.295
NED, STOP, PLEASE.
TOO LATE. YOU ASKED.

07:06.295 --> 07:09.690
MY BROTHER...ASKED FOR YOU.

07:09.690 --> 07:14.956
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA REALIZE
HOW UNUSUAL THAT IS.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.871
IT'S A BREAKTHROUGH,
YOU KNOW.
I DON'T CARE.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.612
ABOUT RICHIE?

07:18.612 --> 07:20.265
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.139
REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID

07:24.139 --> 07:26.097
YOU WERE MAKING
A CONNECTION WITH HIM,

07:26.097 --> 07:27.577
AND I SAID, "NO,
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE,

07:27.577 --> 07:29.187
HE'S A TRUE AUTISTIC"?

07:29.187 --> 07:31.233
I WAS WRONG.

07:31.233 --> 07:34.541
AND YOU WERE RIGHT. SO--

07:34.541 --> 07:36.281
NED, STOP.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

07:36.281 --> 07:39.633
STOP ACTING LIKE
THINGS ARE NORMAL HERE.

07:39.633 --> 07:42.287
JULIA, LISTEN--WE...

07:42.287 --> 07:44.986
WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.944
AND THIS IS JUST
A TURNING POINT FOR US.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.120
THERE IS NO "US."
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:49.120 --> 07:51.296
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THOSE WORDS?

07:51.296 --> 07:52.950
AND HOW DARE YOU USE
YOUR BROTHER LIKE THAT

07:52.950 --> 07:55.518
TO TRY
AND MANIPULATE ME.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.391
TIME WILL PASS.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.176
WHAT?

08:01.176 --> 08:02.743
WHAT?

08:02.743 --> 08:03.831
OK.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.748
OK.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.490
SEE YA.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.672
YOU ARE REALLY GONE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

08:18.672 --> 08:20.195
REALLY GONE.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.110
TAKE IT EASY. WE'RE
IN A PUBLIC PLACE HERE.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.677
NO. YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MADE THIS PUBLIC.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.635
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PUT THIS
IN FRONT OF A JUDGE.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.245
AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
SUPPOSED TO ACCOMPLISH?

08:27.245 --> 08:28.377
HIRE A LAWYER.
HE'LL EXPLAIN.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.597
I CAN'T AFFORD A LAWYER,
AND YOU KNOW THAT!

08:30.597 --> 08:32.250
OR IS THAT THE POINT?

08:32.250 --> 08:33.861
CHARLIE, I DON'T
FEEL SORRY FOR YOU,

08:33.861 --> 08:35.732
BECAUSE WHEN ALL OF US
CAME TO TALK TO YOU,

08:35.732 --> 08:37.604
FOR WHATEVER STUPID REASON,
YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN TO US.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.997
I LISTENED,
AND THEN I SAID NO.
I'M ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

08:39.997 --> 08:41.999
THERE ARE 5 OF US
IN THIS FAMILY.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.480
BUT I'M THE GUARDIAN,
NO MATTER HOW MANY VOTES
YOU LINE UP AGAINST ME.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.134
OK, FINE. WE'LL SEE.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.791
FINE. YOU WANT TO LOSE--

08:50.791 --> 08:53.663
YOU WANT TO LOSE
AND COST THIS FAMILY
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,

08:53.663 --> 08:55.578
GO AHEAD. I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOUR MONEY BULLY ME.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.362
YOU SEEM PRETTY SURE
THAT YOU'D WIN.
I AM.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.321
SO THEN WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
LETTING SOMEBODY ELSE DECIDE?

08:59.321 --> 09:00.844
AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.673
AT $500 AN HOUR? PLENTY.

09:03.673 --> 09:06.371
OK. THEN WHAT IF WE COULD
DO IT CHEAPER, OUT OF COURT?

09:06.371 --> 09:09.679
WHAT? YOU WANT ME
TO FLIP A COIN FOR OWEN?

09:09.679 --> 09:12.116
NO. MY LAWYER SAYS
WE COULD HIRE SOMEONE--

09:12.116 --> 09:14.075
A FAMILY LAW JUDGE
OR WHOEVER.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.381
THEY MAKE A DECISION,
AND WE BOTH AGREE
TO LIVE BY IT.

09:16.381 --> 09:19.341
NO COURTS, NO LAWYERS,
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

09:19.341 --> 09:22.910
JUST YOU AND ME IN A ROOM
WITH SOMEONE TO MAKE
A DECISION.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.129
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.088
I DON'T HAVE TO DO
ANY OF THIS.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.350
YES, YOU DO, BECAUSE...

09:28.350 --> 09:30.004
YOU CAN'T IGNORE A SUBPOENA.

09:30.004 --> 09:32.920
OK? SO...

09:34.704 --> 09:37.838
IN COURT OR OUT OF COURT.
THOSE ARE YOUR OPTIONS.

09:38.969 --> 09:41.015
I'M THINKING OUT.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.933
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, BAILEY?

09:45.933 --> 09:48.326
WHAT MADE BEATING ME
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANYTHING?

09:51.373 --> 09:52.983
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.697
YOU'VE CHOSEN
TO MAKE THIS INFORMAL,

10:10.697 --> 10:12.437
SO THAT MEANS NO LAWYERS
AND NO RULES OF EVIDENCE,

10:12.437 --> 10:14.396
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
NO RULES AT ALL.

10:14.396 --> 10:15.832
MY RULES ARE SIMPLE.

10:15.832 --> 10:18.356
LET THE OTHER GUY FINISH
BEFORE YOU START TO SPEAK,

10:18.356 --> 10:21.316
TRY NOT TO RAISE YOUR VOICE,
AND WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.492
THIS ISN'T A COURTROOM,
BUT I'M A JUDGE,

10:23.492 --> 10:26.451
SO LET'S TRY
AND TREAT THIS PROCESS
WITH RESPECT, ALL RIGHT?

10:26.451 --> 10:28.236
OK.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.585
FINE.

10:29.585 --> 10:33.328
NOW, I HAVE BAILEY'S
WRITTEN STATEMENT HERE,

10:33.328 --> 10:34.982
BUT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
ANYTHING FROM YOU.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.853
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE--
NO.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.638
SO I SHOULD ASSUME--

10:38.638 --> 10:41.249
JUST ASK ME WHATEVER YOU WANT,
AND I'LL ANSWER.

10:41.249 --> 10:44.861
FINE. LET'S GET STARTED.

10:44.861 --> 10:49.823
UM, ACCORDING TO
BAILEY'S STATEMENT HERE,

10:49.823 --> 10:51.433
HE FIRST FELT THAT OWEN

10:51.433 --> 10:53.304
WOULD BE BETTER OFF
IN HIS CUSTODY

10:53.304 --> 10:54.958
WHEN HE WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH--

10:54.958 --> 10:57.569
IT'S CALLED
A PROCESSING DISORDER.

10:57.569 --> 11:00.007
HE HAS TROUBLE INTEGRATING
SENSORY INPUT--

11:00.007 --> 11:01.922
PICTURES AND SOUNDS

11:01.922 --> 11:03.488
AND SYMBOLS.

11:03.488 --> 11:04.794
AND THE RECOMMENDED
THERAPY FOR THIS...

11:04.794 --> 11:06.274
WELL, IT'S A LOT.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.668
IT'S SPECIAL PROGRAMS
AT SCHOOL

11:08.668 --> 11:10.017
AND AT HOME.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.280
IT'S 3 OR MORE HOURS
OF ONE-ON-ONE WORK

11:12.280 --> 11:14.151
WITH A PARENT OR TUTOR,
PER DAY.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.718
AND IT HAS TO START SOON,

11:15.718 --> 11:17.807
OR ELSE HE WON'T START
READING WITH HIS PEERS.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.983
AND IS IT TRUE

11:19.983 --> 11:21.158
THAT CHARLIE BALKED

11:21.158 --> 11:23.247
WHEN YOU TOLD HIM
ABOUT YOUR CONCLUSIONS

11:23.247 --> 11:24.684
ABOUT OWEN'S CONDITION?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.251
INITIALLY, YES.

11:27.251 --> 11:30.037
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO ACCEPT THAT--

11:30.037 --> 11:32.082
I WANTED TO GET
A SECOND OPINION,
THAT'S ALL.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.649
TELL THE JUDGE WHY.

11:33.649 --> 11:36.304
TELL HER WHY YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THE SCHOOL'S DIAGNOSIS.

11:36.304 --> 11:38.698
BECAUSE I WASN'T
ABOUT TO PUT OWEN

11:38.698 --> 11:40.134
INTO SOME HUGE
TREATMENT THING

11:40.134 --> 11:41.178
IF HE DIDN'T
ACTUALLY NEED IT.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.267
IT'S MORE LIKE YOU KNEW

11:43.267 --> 11:44.834
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME
TO GIVE TO IT IF HE DID.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.183
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.750
ADMIT IT, CHARLIE.
IT'S SIMPLE MATH.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.491
YOU WERE HIDING FROM
THE TRUTH BECAUSE--

11:49.491 --> 11:51.449
I WASN'T HIDING
FROM ANYTHING.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.277
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.975
WE'RE NOT GONNA
GET ANYWHERE

11:54.975 --> 11:57.673
IF YOU TWO CAN'T CURB
THE TESTOSTERONE.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

11:57.673 --> 12:02.852
OK. NOW, UM, ACCORDING TO
BAILEY'S STATEMENT,

12:02.852 --> 12:05.463
CHARLIE'S CURRENT
RESPONSIBILITIES
ARE SUCH THAT...

12:05.463 --> 12:07.161
HE USUALLY GETS HOME
AROUND 5:00,

12:07.161 --> 12:09.337
AFTER PICKING UP OWEN.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.556
SOMETIMES
I PICK HIM UP

12:11.556 --> 12:13.558
IF HE'S BUSY
WITH SCHOOL.

12:13.558 --> 12:16.736
THEN IT'S BABY STUFF.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.913
YOU KNOW,
CHANGING DIANA, FEEDING HER,
GIVING HER A BATH.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.611
AND WE SPLIT UP DINNERS.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.134
SOMETIMES I COOK,

12:24.134 --> 12:25.788
BUT MOSTLY HE DOES.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.703
EVER SINCE THE CANCER,

12:27.703 --> 12:29.749
HE'S BEEN KINDA KOOKY

12:29.749 --> 12:32.882
FOR THAT
MACROBIOTIC STUFF.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.754
THAT'S RIGHT.
CHARLIE'S RECOVERING
FROM HODGKIN'S DISEASE?

12:34.754 --> 12:37.757
RECOVERED.
I'M IN FULL REMISSION.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.584
YOU ACTUALLY
PUT THAT IN THERE.

12:39.584 --> 12:42.762
BAILEY, GOD, WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.241
THE FOLLOW-UP
TREATMENTS HE NEEDS
TAKE UP A LOT OF TIME.

12:44.241 --> 12:48.202
SO, UM, AFTER HE GETS
FINISHED WITH HIS CHORES

12:48.202 --> 12:49.856
WITH YOU AND THE KIDS,

12:49.856 --> 12:52.510
HOW MUCH TIME DOES HE HAVE FREE
BEFORE OWEN GOES TO BED?

12:52.510 --> 12:53.947
I DON'T KNOW.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.471
IT'S DIFFERENT
EVERY NIGHT.

12:56.471 --> 12:59.343
WELL, WOULD YOU SAY HE HAS
3 HOURS A NIGHT ON AVERAGE?

12:59.343 --> 13:02.433
WELL...NO.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.479
I CAN MAKE THE TIME
IF I NEED IT.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.220
HOW? DAPHNE'S GONE,
YOU CAN'T IGNORE DIANA,

13:06.220 --> 13:07.874
AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD
TO HIRE HELP.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.137
I'LL ASK
THE QUESTIONS, PLEASE.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.008
YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT,
IN YOUR OPINION?

13:12.008 --> 13:14.532
WOULD CHARLIE
HAVE THE TIME

13:14.532 --> 13:17.057
IF HE MOVED THINGS AROUND
AND GOT SOME HELP FROM YOU?

13:17.057 --> 13:18.101
EVERY DAY?

13:18.101 --> 13:19.624
NO WAY.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.932
I MEAN, I'M...
I'M SORRY, CHARLIE,

13:22.932 --> 13:24.716
I'VE SEEN YOU TRY,

13:24.716 --> 13:27.850
AND...THERE'S NO WAY.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.383
OH, HEY, KIRST.

13:39.383 --> 13:42.212
YOU, TOO?

13:42.212 --> 13:44.998
GOD, I GUESS THEY GOT US
ALL TROTTING OUT,

13:44.998 --> 13:46.477
ONE BY ONE.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.610
I GUESS SO.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.047
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL THEM.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.745
TRUTH IS,
THEY BOTH LOVE OWEN.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.051
THEY BOTH WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.445
BUT CHARLIE
RAISED HIM.

13:57.445 --> 14:00.143
FOR AS LONG AS
HE COULD, ANYWAY.

14:00.143 --> 14:04.147
YOU'VE SEEN HOW CRAZY
IT IS OVER THERE.

14:04.147 --> 14:07.368
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S NOT US START.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.370
RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:09.370 --> 14:13.504
AHEM. SO...
I HEARD YOU'RE NOT
IN THE SHED ANYMORE.

14:13.504 --> 14:16.768
UH, NO. I THINK I MIGHT'VE
FOUND A PLACE, ACTUALLY.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.248
GREAT.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.642
BIG, OLD, HIGH CEILINGS.
GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.210
OF COURSE, IT'S A LITTLE BIT
TOO EXPENSIVE.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.038
YOU'RE LOOKING, TOO, RIGHT?

14:25.038 --> 14:27.083
I AM. I MIGHT'VE
FOUND SOMETHING.

14:27.083 --> 14:30.173
PRICE IS GREAT,
BUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD...

14:30.173 --> 14:32.741
IT'S NOT TOO SAFE,
AND IT'S KINDA FAR
FROM EVERYTHING,

14:32.741 --> 14:34.699
BUT I GOTTA
TAKE SOMETHING,

14:34.699 --> 14:36.832
YOU KNOW, AND MOVE ON.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.355
AWAY FROM YOUR MARRIAGE,
YOU MEAN?

14:38.355 --> 14:40.183
I KNOW THE FEELING.

14:40.183 --> 14:43.404
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I MEANT...

14:43.404 --> 14:44.753
FROM EVERYTHING.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.407
KIRSTEN.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.543
WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME
TALK ABOUT THIS?

14:52.543 --> 14:55.242
WELL, THEY ALL SAY
YOU'RE HIS BEST FRIEND.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.418
SO WHY SHOULD I TESTIFY
AGAINST HIM, THEN?

14:57.418 --> 14:59.072
I MEAN, I DON'T
HAVE TO, RIGHT?

14:59.072 --> 15:00.682
THIS ISN'T A TRIAL
OR ANYTHING.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.858
IT'S OK, KIRSTEN.
YOU CAN ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.164
I DON'T MIND.

15:04.164 --> 15:07.036
WELL, FOR THE RECORD,
IF THERE IS ONE,

15:07.036 --> 15:08.516
I MIND, BAILEY.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.823
DID CHARLIE TALK TO YOU

15:11.823 --> 15:13.695
ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

15:13.695 --> 15:15.436
IF THE BABY'S MOTHER LEFT?

15:15.436 --> 15:17.133
DID HE HAVE A PLAN

15:17.133 --> 15:20.789
FOR HOW HE'D RAISE
ALL 3 KIDS ON HIS OWN?

15:20.789 --> 15:23.531
DID HE SEEM TO HAVE
THOUGHT THAT THROUGH?

15:23.531 --> 15:25.750
KIRSTEN?

15:28.144 --> 15:30.668
I MEAN, HE WAS KIND OF
SHORT-TEMPERED, I GUESS.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.193
BUT I CAN'T SAY
THAT I REALLY BLAME HIM,

15:33.193 --> 15:35.064
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
HE HAD TO DEAL WITH.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.023
HE HAD MORE THAN
HE COULD HANDLE?

15:37.023 --> 15:41.070
YEAH. MORE THAN
ANYBODY COULD.

15:41.070 --> 15:44.073
WELL, SINCE CHARLIE'S
HAD CUSTODY,

15:44.073 --> 15:46.597
4 UNSATISFACTORY VISITATIONS,

15:46.597 --> 15:48.338
INCLUDING ONE REQUIRING

15:48.338 --> 15:49.905
TEMPORARY PLACEMENT
OF THE MINORS ELSEWHERE.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.125
WHEN I WAS
IN THE HOSPITAL.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.866
AND BAILEY WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE COVERING.

15:54.866 --> 15:58.174
WHICH WE NOTED AS INADEQUATE
ALTERNATIVE CARE PROVISION
BY THE GUARDIAN.

15:58.174 --> 16:02.222
DID YOU GET A CALL
AFTER OWEN BROKE HIS ARM?

16:02.222 --> 16:03.658
NO, WE DID NOT.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.617
UM, WHICH IS--

16:06.617 --> 16:09.664
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE NOTIFIED
OF ANY SERIOUS INJURIES.

16:09.664 --> 16:10.665
WHEN WAS THIS?

16:10.665 --> 16:12.232
NICE WORK, BAY.

16:12.232 --> 16:13.624
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.322
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO
BRING HIM INTO THIS?

16:15.322 --> 16:17.672
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE,
JULIA. THE BROKEN ARM,

16:17.672 --> 16:19.717
EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN
FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS.

16:19.717 --> 16:22.546
DON'T START BLAMING ME NOW
IF YOU DON'T LIKE
THE WAY IT SOUNDS.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.159
DID YOU KNOW
HE WAS GONNA DO THIS--

16:26.159 --> 16:27.725
RAKE CHARLIE
OVER THE COALS,

16:27.725 --> 16:29.336
DREDGE UP EVERY MISTAKE
HE'S EVER MADE?

16:29.336 --> 16:31.077
JULIA, WHY ARE YOU
SUDDENLY--

16:31.077 --> 16:33.862
YOU WERE JUST AS MAD AS BAILEY
WHEN CHARLIE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.429
WHAT DID YOU
EXPECT THIS TO--

16:41.435 --> 16:43.741
I'LL TELL HIM TO GO.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.395
YEAH, YOU JUST STAY HERE--

16:45.395 --> 16:46.396
NO, NO.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.007
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO NOW?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.356
DO I HAVE TO ACTUALLY
CALL THE POLICE?

16:49.356 --> 16:51.010
I'LL SAY THIS QUICK,
AND THEN I'LL GO.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.361
I'M SEEING
DR. KESSEL AGAIN.

16:54.361 --> 16:57.494
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT TALKING TO HIM,

16:57.494 --> 17:00.280
SO YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T
GO THERE UNLESS...

17:00.280 --> 17:01.890
I REALLY
WANTED TO CHANGE.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.761
NED--
JULIA.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.198
I'LL DO ANYTHING,

17:05.198 --> 17:06.677
I MEAN, ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD

17:06.677 --> 17:08.070
TO GET US
THROUGH THIS PART.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.680
THIS PART?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.334
I'LL MAKE IT
ALL MY FAULT,

17:11.334 --> 17:12.683
EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED.

17:12.683 --> 17:15.077
I JUST--

17:15.077 --> 17:17.688
I WANT YOU BACK.

17:17.688 --> 17:20.039
YOU'RE SEEING KESSEL?

17:20.039 --> 17:23.042
HAD 2 APPOINTMENTS
ALREADY.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.913
I'M SEEING HIM AGAIN
ON THURSDAY.

17:24.913 --> 17:27.481
GOOD...FOR YOU.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.961
NOT FOR ME.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.354
JULIA--

17:31.354 --> 17:32.921
GET AWAY FROM ME, NED.
I MEAN IT.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.924
THAT'S IT. I'M GETTING
CHARLIE AND BAILEY.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.059
I'VE BEEN REREADING
BAILEY'S STATEMENT,

17:40.059 --> 17:42.496
AND I'VE DECIDED TO CALL
MS. WALSH.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.846
HOLD ON. MY--MY BOSS?
YOU'RE BRINGING IN
MY BOSS?

17:44.846 --> 17:46.456
ALL RIGHT, DON'T START.

17:46.456 --> 17:47.631
I AM GETTING
SO SICK OF THIS, CHARLIE.

17:47.631 --> 17:49.285
THAT'S ENOUGH.

17:49.285 --> 17:52.201
BECAUSE IF YOU STOPPED
FEELING WRONGED AND ABUSED

17:52.201 --> 17:54.290
FOR 10 SECONDS,

17:54.290 --> 17:55.726
YOU WOULD REALIZE
THAT I'M JUST TRYING
TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT.

17:55.726 --> 17:56.814
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.642
WE'RE ALL A LITTLE TIRED.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.209
WHY DON'T WE
PICK THIS UP TOMORROW?

18:00.209 --> 18:02.820
ANYTHING ELSE
IS OFF THE RECORD.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.652
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

18:08.652 --> 18:11.177
HOW IS THIS--
HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE A BIG FAVOR?

18:11.177 --> 18:13.483
YOU NEVER WANTED US,
CHARLIE, EVER,
SINCE DAY ONE.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.920
WHAT?

18:15.920 --> 18:18.053
BAILEY, STOP IT.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.795
NO, IT'S TRUE.
FROM THE MINUTE YOU GOT
BACK INTO THE HOUSE,

18:20.795 --> 18:23.058
ALL YOU DID WAS COMPLAIN
ABOUT HOW YOU HAD TO
TAKE CARE OF US.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.756
ABOUT HOW YOU HAD TO
GIVE UP YOUR WHOLE
FUTURE FOR US.

18:25.756 --> 18:28.629
THAT IS--BAILEY, EVEN--
EVEN IF I THOUGHT THAT
ONCE--

18:28.629 --> 18:30.805
THAT WAS YEARS AGO, BAILEY.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.154
WAS IT, JULIA?
WAS IT YEARS AGO?
WHAT ABOUT THIS PAST YEAR?

18:32.154 --> 18:35.114
HOW GLAD HE WAS
FOR US TO BE TAKING
THINGS OFF HIS HANDS--

18:35.114 --> 18:36.245
THE RESTAURANT, THE KIDS.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.855
BAILEY...

18:37.855 --> 18:39.683
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:39.683 --> 18:42.208
OWEN--OWEN HAS BEEN
LIKE A SON FOR ME
FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.818
YOU THINK THAT
I DON'T LOVE HIM?

18:43.818 --> 18:45.385
YOU THINK I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT HIM?

18:45.385 --> 18:47.430
THEN WHY DON'T YOU DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM?

18:47.430 --> 18:49.345
I AM WHAT'S BEST
FOR HIM!

18:49.345 --> 18:50.912
THE ONLY DAD
THAT HE'S HAD
FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS!

18:50.912 --> 18:52.392
THEN WHY DOES HE
WANT ME?

18:52.392 --> 18:54.002
YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT
FOR ME?

18:54.002 --> 18:55.569
THAT'S ENOUGH, BAILEY.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.490
CHARLIE...

19:03.490 --> 19:04.882
JULIA, DON'T,
YOU KNOW?

19:04.882 --> 19:06.536
JUST--YOU GUYS...

19:06.536 --> 19:08.538
YOU'VE ALL SAID ENOUGH.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.889
I MEAN, YEAH.

19:11.889 --> 19:15.328
I HATED TO GIVE UP
ALL OF THAT STUFF.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.417
THE...DESIGNING,

19:17.417 --> 19:18.722
SEATTLE.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.811
A MILLION
DIFFERENT THINGS.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.465
BUT I DID IT.

19:22.465 --> 19:25.425
I GAVE IT UP,
AND I STAYED
IN THAT HOUSE,

19:25.425 --> 19:27.992
AND I DID THE BEST
THAT I COULD.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.864
AND NOW...

19:29.864 --> 19:32.432
THE FIRST
REALLY GOOD THING
THAT COMES ALONG,

19:32.432 --> 19:34.434
THE FIRST THING
FOR ME,

19:34.434 --> 19:35.826
THAT I ACTUALLY TAKE...

19:35.826 --> 19:37.828
MY LITTLE GIRL...

19:37.828 --> 19:40.875
AND YOU WANT TO
PUNISH ME FOR IT.

19:40.875 --> 19:44.183
WHY, BECAUSE I ACTUALLY
WANTED A LIFE FOR MYSELF?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.228
CHARLIE, NO ONE IS SAYING--

19:46.228 --> 19:48.839
AND YOU DON'T REALIZE
THAT YOU GUYS ARE ALL
I'VE GOT NOW.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.885
EVERYTHING ELSE
I LET GO.

19:50.885 --> 19:54.976
SO THIS, ALL OF YOU--
ALL OF YOU TURNING
ON ME LIKE THIS...

19:57.152 --> 19:59.241
IT'S NOT JUST OWEN
YOU'RE TAKING AWAY.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.001
I CALLED 11 TIMES
LAST NIGHT,

20:20.001 --> 20:21.698
AND HE NEVER PICKED UP.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.832
HE HASN'T SAID
A SINGLE WORD TO ME
SINCE YESTERDAY.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.921
HE JUST TOOK DIANA
AND OWEN IN HIS ROOM

20:26.921 --> 20:28.575
AND JUST STAYED THERE.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.794
LOOK, GUYS, WE KNEW
THAT HE WOULD BE UPSET.
WE KNEW THAT.

20:30.794 --> 20:31.839
OK?

20:35.582 --> 20:37.497
OH, GOOD,
YOU'RE ALL HERE.

20:37.497 --> 20:38.759
WHAT'S THIS?

20:38.759 --> 20:40.413
I MADE
SOME NOTES.

20:44.112 --> 20:47.420
6 OF THE LAST 15 WEEKS,
MORE OR LESS,

20:47.420 --> 20:49.117
IF YOU ADD
ALL THE DAYS TOGETHER.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.337
INCLUDING CHRISTMAS,
IT SAYS HERE.

20:53.904 --> 20:56.298
SO OWEN FITS INTO YOUR LIVES
PRETTY NICELY.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.604
YEAH.

20:57.604 --> 20:58.866
SURE.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.955
I--I MEAN, BETWEEN US,

21:00.955 --> 21:03.044
WE'RE THERE
EVERY MINUTE HE IS.

21:03.044 --> 21:05.438
AND BAILEY'S GOT LOADS
OF TIME NOW, YOU KNOW,

21:05.438 --> 21:07.657
NOW THAT HE HIRED
A MANAGER AT WORK.

21:07.657 --> 21:08.658
AND WHAT ABOUT SPACE?

21:08.658 --> 21:10.704
YOU LIVE IN
A ONE-ROOM LOFT?

21:10.704 --> 21:12.706
UM...2 NOW.

21:12.706 --> 21:15.883
BAILEY WALLED IN
A BEDROOM FOR OWEN,

21:15.883 --> 21:18.189
WITH A BED AND A DESK
AND A COMPUTER.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.148
THERE'S A--
THERE'S A FLOOR PLAN.

21:20.148 --> 21:22.498
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S IN YOUR NOTES.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.500
YES, I HAVE IT
RIGHT HERE.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.893
THANK YOU.

21:25.893 --> 21:26.807
UM...OK.

21:28.548 --> 21:31.028
SARAH, YOU'RE
A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.769
IS THAT CORRECT?

21:32.769 --> 21:34.423
UH-HUH.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.730
WHICH MAKES YOU
HOW OLD?

21:36.730 --> 21:38.340
UM...19.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.298
ALMOST 20.

21:41.038 --> 21:44.607
DO YOU HAVE ANY
YOUNGER SIBLINGS
IN YOUR FAMILY

21:44.607 --> 21:46.479
OR COUSINS?

21:46.479 --> 21:48.785
DO YOU HAVE ANY
PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE
TAKING CARE OF KIDS?

21:48.785 --> 21:51.484
UH...

21:51.484 --> 21:53.703
WELL...

21:53.703 --> 21:55.923
NO. NO, NOT REALLY.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.925
BUT, UM, ALL THE TIME
THAT I'VE SPENT WITH OWEN--

21:57.925 --> 21:59.753
THANKS. THAT'S ALL
I NEED TO KNOW.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.322
I NEED TO TAKE A PAUSE
RIGHT NOW,

22:03.322 --> 22:07.064
BECAUSE THERE ARE
A FEW OTHER PEOPLE
I HAVE TO HEAR FROM. OK?

22:10.459 --> 22:11.852
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

22:11.852 --> 22:12.896
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:27.520 --> 22:28.521
HELLO.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.437
HELLO, I SAID.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.613
WHO'S THERE?

22:36.485 --> 22:37.747
I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED
THAT VOICE.

22:37.747 --> 22:38.748
GRIFFIN?

22:38.748 --> 22:40.402
WHAT--

22:40.402 --> 22:41.534
NO.

22:41.534 --> 22:42.796
YES?

22:42.796 --> 22:44.624
YES.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.321
NO.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.366
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE GETTING
AN APARTMENT

22:47.366 --> 22:49.324
IN SOME FUNKY
NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.717
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GETTING
SOME REALLY EXPENSIVE
APARTMENT.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.240
I WAS.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.676
I WAS.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.725
OHH...

22:58.725 --> 23:00.379
THE DIFFERENCE
IN CRIME RATES

23:00.379 --> 23:03.251
BETWEEN PACIFIC HEIGHTS
AND BAILEY'S NEIGHBORHOOD?

23:03.251 --> 23:05.862
WELL, ONE HAS FLOWERPOTS
IN THE WINDOWS.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.386
THE OTHER HAS IRON BARS.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.605
COME ON,
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.215
LET ME BE MORE
SPECIFIC, DETECTIVE.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.739
TELL ME ABOUT
BAILEY'S BUILDING.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.784
WAIT A SECOND.
I KNOW WHERE THIS
IS GOING, OK?

23:14.784 --> 23:17.396
YOU'LL GET YOUR TURN,
BAILEY. DETECTIVE?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.962
HERE'S 2 THINGS
I WOULDN'T DO.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.269
BUY A GUN I DIDN'T NEED,

23:21.269 --> 23:24.272
THEN HAVE AN EX-CON OVER
SO HE COULD STEAL IT
TO SHOOT THE NEIGHBORS.

23:27.884 --> 23:30.452
Julia: WELL, I TRIED TO
TALK HIM OUT OF DROPPING OUT.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.888
BAILEY WAS ONLY
A SOPHOMORE.

23:31.888 --> 23:34.151
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
THAT DECISION AS RATIONAL,

23:34.151 --> 23:35.805
MATURE?

23:35.805 --> 23:38.721
WELL, I GUESS NO.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.854
DID YOU EVER ATTEND
ANY AL-ANON MEETINGS?

23:40.854 --> 23:43.160
WHAT?

23:43.160 --> 23:45.946
WELL, I ASK BECAUSE
THAT'S AN ALCOHOLIC
TRAIT, ISN'T IT,

23:45.946 --> 23:48.383
THE...COMPULSIVE TENDENCY
TO TAKE ON BIG PROJECTS

23:48.383 --> 23:49.471
AND NOT BE ABLE
TO FOLLOW THROUGH?

23:50.951 --> 23:53.475
THAT'S WHAT
AN INTERVENTION IS.

23:53.475 --> 23:56.173
WHEN WE--WE ASKED HIM
TO QUIT.

23:56.173 --> 23:58.872
THAT DOESN'T--
DOESN'T MAKE HIM
SOME SORT OF--

23:58.872 --> 23:59.960
WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY
WHEN YOU ASKED HIM?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.527
DID HE SAY YES?

24:01.527 --> 24:03.790
DID HE PROMISE
TO QUIT?

24:03.790 --> 24:06.270
NOT RIGHT AWAY,
BUT...

24:06.270 --> 24:08.185
EVENTUALLY, YEAH.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.752
THE ANSWER IS NO, THEN.
RIGHT?

24:09.752 --> 24:12.015
BRUISES.

24:12.015 --> 24:14.757
AND SOME STITCHES
WHERE I HIT THE WINDSHIELD,

24:14.757 --> 24:16.716
AND I GUESS
I HAD A CONCUSSION.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.979
BUT AFTER THE ACCIDENT,
HE GOT HELP?

24:18.979 --> 24:20.633
HE WENT TO AA,

24:20.633 --> 24:22.809
AND HE'S BEEN GOING
EVER SINCE.

24:22.809 --> 24:25.507
DID HE HAVE ANY SLIP-UPS...

24:25.507 --> 24:27.553
OR WAS THAT THE END
FOR BAILEY AND DRINKING?

24:30.947 --> 24:32.862
SARAH?

24:32.862 --> 24:33.863
WHY...

24:33.863 --> 24:35.865
WHY ARE YOU EVEN...ASKING?

24:35.865 --> 24:38.781
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
CHARLIE'S NOTES THERE.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.175
YOU HAVE ALL THE DIRT
ON BAILEY NOW,

24:41.175 --> 24:42.655
SO WHY MAKE ME SAY IT?

24:44.047 --> 24:45.614
THE BURDEN OF PROOF

24:45.614 --> 24:47.442
IS ON YOUR BOYFRIEND,
SARAH.

24:47.442 --> 24:50.924
WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING
AT CHARLIE'S RECORD HERE.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.187
NOT UNTIL WE ABSOLUTELY
HAVE TO.

24:53.187 --> 24:54.971
THAT'S THE POLICY,
BASICALLY.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.407
AND WHEN IS THAT?

24:56.407 --> 24:58.192
EXTREME NEGLECT...

24:58.192 --> 24:59.236
REPEATED ABUSE.

24:59.236 --> 25:00.977
BUT WHY WAIT TILL THEN?

25:00.977 --> 25:04.111
BECAUSE STUDIES SHOW
THAT TAKING A KID

25:04.111 --> 25:06.635
FROM THE PEOPLE
AND PLACES THEY KNOW
DOES DAMAGE.

25:06.635 --> 25:10.726
SOMETIMES MORE DAMAGE
THAN A PARENT WHO HURTS THEM.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.206
WAIT. HOLD ON A SECOND.
I'M NOT SOME FOSTER HOME
HERE, OK?

25:12.206 --> 25:13.599
I'M HIS BROTHER.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.426
WHO'S BEEN AWAY FROM HOME
FOR 2 WHOLE YEARS.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.603
WHO LIVES SOMEPLACE
THAT OWEN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.430
EXCEPT FOR THE 2 MONTHS
THAT HE STAYED THERE

25:19.430 --> 25:20.431
BECAUSE YOU
COULDN'T HACK IT.

25:20.431 --> 25:21.911
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:21.911 --> 25:23.826
WE GOT THROUGH ONE WHOLE DAY
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.828
LET'S KEEP IT AT THAT.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.351
I'LL SEE YOU HERE TOMORROW,

25:27.351 --> 25:28.918
AFTER LUNCH.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.357
WELL, ONE THING WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD--

25:33.357 --> 25:35.185
THERE'S SOME GREAT
MEXICAN TAKEOUT.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.230
NAPKIN?

25:36.230 --> 25:37.274
MMM.

25:37.274 --> 25:39.276
GRIFFIN, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS?

25:39.276 --> 25:40.887
KIRSTEN,
WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

25:40.887 --> 25:42.628
THE PLACE IS YOURS.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.194
BUT I FEEL BAD.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.283
I MEAN, YOU LOVE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND--

25:46.283 --> 25:48.024
I CAN'T AFFORD IT.
I TOLD YOU.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.288
[SIGHS]

25:51.288 --> 25:52.551
OK, BUT, YOU SURE?

25:52.551 --> 25:53.639
YOU DON'T MIND?

25:53.639 --> 25:55.075
I'LL BE FINE.

25:56.772 --> 25:58.426
EXCEPT FOR, UM,

25:58.426 --> 26:00.428
MAYBE--MAYBE JUST
FOR TONIGHT?

26:00.428 --> 26:02.517
I MEAN,
THE FLOOR WOULD BE--

26:02.517 --> 26:03.562
NO. NO WAY.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.129
I MEAN...
NOT JUST FOR TONIGHT.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.044
YOU CRASH HERE
UNTIL YOU FIND
A NEW PLACE.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.393
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.004
COOL.

26:12.483 --> 26:16.052
MAN, WAS THAT INTENSE
YESTERDAY?

26:16.052 --> 26:17.706
I MEAN, ALL THAT STUFF
BETWEEN CHARLIE AND BAILEY.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.839
IT WAS.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.276
AND BAILEY IS--

26:22.276 --> 26:24.495
ACTUALLY...

26:24.495 --> 26:25.845
GRIFFIN...

26:25.845 --> 26:26.846
MM-MMM.

26:26.846 --> 26:27.847
REMEMBER?

26:27.847 --> 26:29.065
REMEMBER THE WHOLE IDEA?

26:29.065 --> 26:30.545
WHEN IT'S TIME
TO MOVE ON...

26:30.545 --> 26:31.546
RIGHT. GOOD.

26:31.546 --> 26:32.939
MOVIN' ON. YEAH.

26:34.288 --> 26:35.724
HOW ABOUT THOSE GIANTS, HUH?

26:35.724 --> 26:37.334
HECK OF A TEAM, I HEAR.

26:39.206 --> 26:40.860
SO SHE IS LETTING YOU

26:40.860 --> 26:42.601
DO YOUR ITALIAN PAPER
ON A MOVIE?

26:42.601 --> 26:43.993
DUH. AN ITALIAN MOVIE.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.342
A GREAT ITALIAN MOVIE.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.866
CINEMA PARADISO.

26:46.866 --> 26:49.477
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
I SAW IT.

26:49.477 --> 26:52.480
I JUST--
I DON'T LIKE MOVIES
ABOUT MOVIES.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.873
IT'S NOT ABOUT MOVIES.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.570
IT'S ABOUT GROWING UP.

26:55.570 --> 26:58.573
AND MEMORY AND...

27:05.406 --> 27:07.277
YOU OK?

27:07.277 --> 27:09.540
YEAH, SURE.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.413
SO WHAT'S YOUR PAPER ON?

27:12.413 --> 27:14.284
DANTE AND BEATRICE.

27:16.983 --> 27:19.028
SO, WHAT, YOU'VE
CHANGED YOUR MIND?

27:19.028 --> 27:21.161
YOU THINK THAT OWEN
BELONGS WITH CHARLIE NOW?

27:21.161 --> 27:22.597
NO, CLAUDIA,
OF COURSE NOT.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.904
IF YOU DON'T LET OWEN
TELL HER WHAT HE WANTS,

27:24.904 --> 27:26.819
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.864
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT TO HIM.

27:28.864 --> 27:31.214
TO BRING HIM IN THERE
AND MAKE HIM CHOOSE,

27:31.214 --> 27:33.695
WITH BOTH OF US
SITTING THERE WATCHING.

27:33.695 --> 27:36.872
SO YOU JUST PUT US ALL
THROUGH THIS FOR NOTHING.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.440
I KNOW THAT THAT JUDGE
CAN SEE THAT I'M RIGHT.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.137
I KNOW IF SHE JUST
LOOKS AT THE FACTS--

27:41.137 --> 27:42.791
LOOK, SHE'S A JUDGE, OK?

27:42.791 --> 27:44.184
SHE LOOKS AT THE LAW,
AND...

27:44.184 --> 27:45.533
IT'S NOT ON YOUR SIDE.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.839
IT NEVER WAS.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.449
[SIGHS]

27:48.449 --> 27:50.494
BUT, YOU SEE...

27:50.494 --> 27:53.019
IF BRINGING HIM
IN THERE...

27:53.019 --> 27:54.803
IF THAT'S
THE ONLY WAY TO WIN...

27:56.457 --> 27:58.459
YOU CONVINCED US
THAT THIS WAS RIGHT.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.461
YOU SAID THAT EVEN IF
OWEN GETS SCARED

28:00.461 --> 28:02.898
OR CHARLIE GETS ANGRY
THAT OWEN NEEDS YOU, BAILEY.

28:07.598 --> 28:08.991
I DON'T KNOW,
CLAUDIA.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.036
I DON'T KNOW.

28:15.998 --> 28:19.001
OH, I'M, LIKE,
SICK OF MYSELF.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.003
I'M MAD I'M EVEN
DISCUSSING THIS.

28:21.003 --> 28:23.702
I'M MAD I'M EVEN
THINKING ABOUT THIS.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.399
ABOUT GETTING
BACK TOGETHER WITH NED?

28:25.399 --> 28:26.705
NO.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.706
NO. I'M...

28:27.706 --> 28:29.664
I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO HIM.

28:29.664 --> 28:30.709
I'D NEVER...

28:33.233 --> 28:35.061
IT'S JUST THESE FEELINGS

28:35.061 --> 28:37.150
THAT I--
I KEEP HAVING

28:37.150 --> 28:38.717
THAT I CAN'T STOP.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.981
LOOK, I CAN'T...

28:41.981 --> 28:44.984
THROW A SWITCH
OR GIVE YOU A PILL

28:44.984 --> 28:47.638
TO MAKE THOSE FEELINGS
GO AWAY.

28:47.638 --> 28:50.337
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO HAVE THEM...

28:50.337 --> 28:52.121
AND HAVE THEM...

28:52.121 --> 28:53.470
UNTIL YOU DON'T.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.995
GOD, I JUST...

28:55.995 --> 28:57.344
I KNOW.

28:57.344 --> 28:58.911
IT'S HARD.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.435
BUT DON'T LET THAT
TEMPT YOU TO GO BACK

29:01.435 --> 29:02.741
WHERE YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO.

29:04.481 --> 29:05.569
I KNOW.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.184
BUT...

29:13.360 --> 29:15.101
WHAT? THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.147
WELL, IT'S--IT'S...

29:18.147 --> 29:19.453
STUPID.

29:20.933 --> 29:24.458
AND I KNOW
I SHOULDN'T CARE, BUT...

29:24.458 --> 29:27.983
COULD YOU TELL ME,
DOES HE SEEM BETTER
TO YOU?

29:27.983 --> 29:30.290
I DON'T FOLLOW
YOUR QUESTION.

29:30.290 --> 29:33.772
WELL, NED, IS--
I MEAN, IS HE MAKING
PROGRESS?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.774
AND I KNOW
HOW IT SOUNDS,

29:35.774 --> 29:37.601
BUT I GUESS
I CAN'T HELP CARING.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.908
HOW WOULD I KNOW
IF HE'S GETTING BETTER?

29:39.908 --> 29:44.304
WELL, SINCE HE'S BEEN
COMING BACK TO YOU
SINCE WE BROKE UP...

29:44.304 --> 29:47.002
JULIA, I CAN'T COMMENT
ON ANOTHER PATIENT'S TREATMENT,

29:47.002 --> 29:49.396
EVEN TO SAY...

29:49.396 --> 29:50.876
IF HE'S SEEN ME.

29:52.616 --> 29:54.836
BUT YOU JUST SAID...

29:54.836 --> 29:57.796
YOU ASKED ME
HOW YOU COULD KNOW THAT.

29:59.145 --> 30:02.888
SO, WHAT, THAT MEANS...

30:02.888 --> 30:04.628
HE HASN'T SEEN YOU,
HAS HE?

30:04.628 --> 30:06.543
HE HASN'T...

30:06.543 --> 30:07.849
HE HASN'T COME BACK.

30:15.204 --> 30:17.337
BAILEY!

30:17.337 --> 30:18.555
BAILEY!

30:18.555 --> 30:19.861
HEY, BUDDY.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.168
HOW YOU DOIN'?

30:22.168 --> 30:23.169
OK? HUH?

30:23.169 --> 30:24.953
HOW COME I DON'T
SEE YOU ANYMORE?

30:24.953 --> 30:27.434
YOU'RE GONNA
SEE ME SOON. OK?

30:27.434 --> 30:30.959
WHY IS EVERYONE
LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

30:30.959 --> 30:32.700
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:32.700 --> 30:34.397
EVERYBODY WANTS
TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

30:34.397 --> 30:35.398
THAT'S IT.

30:35.398 --> 30:36.704
BUT WHY?

30:36.704 --> 30:38.924
BECAUSE...WE ALL
CARE ABOUT YOU
SO MUCH,

30:38.924 --> 30:40.664
WE WANT TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

30:40.664 --> 30:43.015
I DON'T CARE, OK?
I WANT YOU TO STOP.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.930
OWEN, WE CAN'T STOP
CARING ABOUT YOU.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.583
I HATE THIS, BAILEY.

30:46.583 --> 30:49.717
I WANT YOU TO STOP, OK?
I HATE THIS.

30:49.717 --> 30:52.024
OWEN?

30:52.024 --> 30:54.156
HI.

30:54.156 --> 30:55.984
MY NAME IS JOAN.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.856
I'M A JUDGE.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.988
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

30:59.988 --> 31:01.816
WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

31:01.816 --> 31:04.471
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS THAT WE'RE ALL
YOUR FRIENDS,

31:04.471 --> 31:06.473
AND WE'D LIKE YOU
TO COME INSIDE

31:06.473 --> 31:07.866
SO WE CAN ASK YOU--

31:07.866 --> 31:10.129
SO THAT WE CAN
SHOW YOU--

31:10.129 --> 31:12.522
SO THAT YOU CAN SEE
THAT EVERYTHING'S OK.

31:12.522 --> 31:15.177
THAT YOUR WHOLE FAMILY
IS HERE, AND...

31:15.177 --> 31:16.962
NOBODY'S FIGHTING.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.225
WE'RE JUST TALKING,
AND EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OK,

31:19.225 --> 31:20.226
ALL RIGHT, BUD?

31:20.226 --> 31:21.227
OK.

31:21.227 --> 31:22.358
ALL RIGHT.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.621
SO, OWEN, WHY DON'T YOU
COME HERE--

31:24.621 --> 31:26.232
HE'S NOT GONNA STAY.

31:26.232 --> 31:27.494
COULD YOU PLEASE
TAKE HIM BACK
TO THE HOUSE?

31:27.494 --> 31:29.061
Sarah: COULD I WHAT?

31:29.061 --> 31:31.367
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.152
HE'S NOT GONNA ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS, OK?
I CHANGED MY MIND.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.675
PLEASE, TAKE HIM HOME.
SORRY?

31:34.675 --> 31:35.632
Sarah: ARE YOU SURE?

31:35.632 --> 31:36.851
YES, I'M SURE.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.853
OWE. YOU GO
WITH SARAH.

31:38.853 --> 31:41.203
OK, BUDDY?
AND I'LL CALL YOU
LATER.

31:41.203 --> 31:41.987
IT'S OK.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.123
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

31:48.123 --> 31:50.082
OH, COME ON,
YOU DIDN'T GET THAT?

31:50.082 --> 31:51.692
BAILEY'S LITTLE
PERFORMANCE THERE?

31:51.692 --> 31:54.173
CHARLIE, COME ON.

31:54.173 --> 31:56.305
CARING DAD WHO CAN'T
STAND TO SEE HIS SON
IN PAIN.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.264
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S COOL IT.

31:58.264 --> 32:00.005
I MEAN, NOW THAT HE KNOWS
THAT HE CAN'T WIN...

32:00.005 --> 32:02.268
YOU KNOW WHAT, CHARLIE?
YOU'RE NOT IMPRESSING
ANYBODY HERE, OK?

32:02.268 --> 32:04.444
WHEN YOU ARE SO STUPID
WITH PRIDE

32:04.444 --> 32:07.186
THAT IT TAKES A SUBPOENA
TO GET THROUGH YOUR SKULL.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.883
IS THIS HOW YOU PLAN
TO BRING UP OWEN, HUH?

32:08.883 --> 32:10.232
WITH LAWSUITS
AND THREATS?

32:10.232 --> 32:12.669
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO LOST MY KID
IN THE MALL. OK?

32:12.669 --> 32:14.410
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO
KNOCKED UP SOME STRIPPER.

32:14.410 --> 32:15.977
BAILEY, GOD.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.196
THAT'S ENOUGH,
ALL OF YOU.

32:17.196 --> 32:18.806
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANOTHER WORD.

32:18.806 --> 32:21.330
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.
I'VE MADE A DECISION.

32:21.330 --> 32:22.810
WHAT, ALREADY?

32:22.810 --> 32:24.159
[SIGHS]

32:24.159 --> 32:26.988
I HOPE IT PUTS
AN END TO THIS,
BUT I DOUBT IT.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.382
IF I WAS
THE CASEWORKER, I'D...

32:29.382 --> 32:32.298
GIVE THE BOY A BREAK
FROM THE BOTH OF YOU.

32:32.298 --> 32:34.300
BUT I CAN ONLY TELL YOU
WHO WINS.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.170
SO HERE IT IS.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.875
DIDN'T GET
WHAT YOU WANTED, HUH?

32:44.875 --> 32:46.355
CHARLIE,
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

32:46.355 --> 32:47.617
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T JUST
WANT OWEN, DID YOU?

32:47.617 --> 32:48.749
YOU WANTED HER
TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

32:48.749 --> 32:50.707
BAILEY'S NUMBER ONE.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.274
BETTER AT RUNNING
A RESTAURANT.
BETTER AT BEING A DAD.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.972
LET IT GO, CHARLIE.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.756
NO, IT'S OK.
IF HE WANTS TO DO THIS,
THAT'S FINE.

32:55.756 --> 32:57.062
BUT YOU GET THIS
THROUGH YOUR HEAD, OK?

32:57.062 --> 32:59.020
I NEVER SAID
YOU WEREN'T A GOOD PARENT.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.587
YES, YOU DID!
A THOUSAND TIMES.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.850
THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD,
BUT I NEVER SAID THAT, EVER.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.895
ALL I EVER SAID WAS THAT
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.767
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOOK THAT AS A SLAM.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.638
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GOT ALL OFFENDED BY IT.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.510
WHAT, WE GONNA
FIGHT THIS OUT AGAIN?

33:10.510 --> 33:12.164
NO, WE'RE NOT.
OK, YOU WON.

33:12.164 --> 33:13.513
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR
WHY I DID THIS, OK?

33:13.513 --> 33:14.905
I DIDN'T DO THIS
TO BEAT YOU,

33:14.905 --> 33:16.255
AND I DIDN'T DO IT
TO PUT YOU DOWN.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.387
I DID IT TO MAKE YOU
DO THE MATH.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.259
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.
I'M DONE WITH THIS.

33:20.259 --> 33:23.088
OWEN NEEDS TIME
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE,
CHARLIE,

33:23.088 --> 33:24.698
AND I WANTED YOU
TO SEE THAT.

33:24.698 --> 33:25.829
AND THAT'S ALL I WANTED.

33:57.078 --> 33:58.949
THE STALKER, RIGHT?

33:58.949 --> 34:01.474
THAT'S WHAT
I SORT OF AM...

34:01.474 --> 34:02.475
NOW?

34:02.475 --> 34:04.433
WELL, UH...

34:04.433 --> 34:06.392
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.785
I'M HERE
NOT TO DO THAT--

34:08.785 --> 34:11.353
TO SAY...SORRY...

34:11.353 --> 34:12.441
FOR THAT.

34:13.529 --> 34:14.704
OK.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.099
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT
COMING BACK.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.101
I GOT TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

34:20.101 --> 34:23.017
AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS YOU'RE NOT
COMING BACK.

34:23.017 --> 34:25.672
SO IF I PRESS THINGS...

34:25.672 --> 34:27.326
I'LL JUST
TICK YOU OFF,

34:27.326 --> 34:29.197
SO THEN...
WE CAN'T EVEN
BE FRIENDS.

34:31.808 --> 34:34.420
WHICH IS WHAT I WANT,
JULIA,

34:34.420 --> 34:36.770
TO AT LEAST BE FRIENDS.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.211
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

34:46.606 --> 34:48.173
I DON'T KNOW.

34:48.173 --> 34:50.175
OK.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.176
THAT'S SOMETHING.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.525
SO, THEN...

34:52.525 --> 34:53.917
THE QUESTION IS...

34:56.964 --> 34:59.445
DO YOU WANT TO MAYBE
HANG TOGETHER

34:59.445 --> 35:01.229
TONIGHT, LET'S SAY?

35:01.229 --> 35:02.665
TONIGHT, NED?

35:02.665 --> 35:04.841
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE--

35:04.841 --> 35:06.800
NO, ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW, IT...

35:06.800 --> 35:08.584
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

35:10.934 --> 35:13.285
HOW ABOUT MY ROOM,
AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE?

35:21.119 --> 35:22.511
Owen: YEAH, I DID.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.122
I DID IT.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.514
BY MYSELF.

35:25.514 --> 35:27.125
IT'S OK, BAILEY.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.039
I GOT A LOT RIGHT.

35:29.039 --> 35:29.779
I DID.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.130
OK.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.566
TOMORROW?

35:33.566 --> 35:34.567
AT 5:00?

35:34.567 --> 35:35.568
I WILL.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.178
I'LL BE HERE.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.136
OK. BYE.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.883
THAT WAS JUST...UM...

35:46.883 --> 35:48.276
IT WAS BAILEY.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.322
I KNOW. IT'S OK.

35:50.322 --> 35:51.627
IT IS?

35:51.627 --> 35:53.890
YEAH.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.502
I BETTER GET
SOME FOOD IN HER.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.808
I'LL SEE YOU
A LITTLE BIT LATER, OK?

36:05.250 --> 36:08.166
NO, THAT'S NOT EVEN IT.
THAT'S NOT EVEN IT.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.168
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
MORE TO THE LEFT?

36:10.168 --> 36:11.778
IT'S NOT THAT
THEY DON'T CARE.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.214
IT'S THAT
THEY CARE TOO MUCH.

36:13.214 --> 36:15.085
BAILEY AND CHARLIE
AND ALL OF THEM.

36:15.085 --> 36:16.870
RIGHT. IT'S LIKE

36:16.870 --> 36:19.612
THEY'RE ALWAYS
TRYING TO HARD
TO PROTECT EACH OTHER.

36:19.612 --> 36:21.918
INSTEAD OF HAVING
ZERO PARENTS,
THEY HAVE 5.

36:21.918 --> 36:22.789
EXACTLY.

36:25.748 --> 36:29.143
GOD, GRIFFIN,
I DON'T KNOW.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.885
IS--IS THIS WRONG?
I THINK THIS IS WRONG.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.148
YOU WANT TO TRY
BY THE BAY WINDOW AGAIN?

36:34.148 --> 36:36.542
NO, NO. THIS.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.196
THIS RULE THAT WE MADE

36:38.196 --> 36:40.676
THAT WE HAVEN'T STUCK TO
FOR MORE THAN 10 SECONDS.

36:40.676 --> 36:44.158
RIGHT. THE WHOLE
MOVING ON THING.

36:44.158 --> 36:46.160
IT'S JUST...

36:46.160 --> 36:47.553
I MEAN, YOU'RE...HERE,

36:47.553 --> 36:49.816
AND I SEE YOU, AND...

36:49.816 --> 36:50.860
AND IT TAKES YOU
BACK TO THEM.

36:54.342 --> 36:56.344
I KNOW.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.912
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
HAS TO CHANGE.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.176
AND I SHOULD JUST
GET OUT OF HERE.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.526
NO. NO, GRIFFIN, WAIT.
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

37:04.526 --> 37:07.225
REALLY, IT'S ONLY
COMMON SENSE, KIRSTEN.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.400
YOU...

37:08.400 --> 37:10.315
YOU CAN'T MOVE ON
WITHOUT MOVIN'.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.229
RIGHT?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.254
HEY.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.473
NICE JOB WITH THE BED.

37:38.473 --> 37:41.128
I CAN'T DO THOSE
HOSPITAL CORNERS,

37:41.128 --> 37:44.174
BUT I BRUSHED MY TEETH
AND GOT MY JAMMIES ON.

37:55.403 --> 37:56.491
OWEN...

37:56.491 --> 37:58.276
[CLEARS THROAT]

38:04.412 --> 38:06.545
YOU KNOW THAT
I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?

38:10.026 --> 38:12.333
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

38:12.333 --> 38:13.552
TO--TO SAY THAT
TO SOMEONE?

38:14.814 --> 38:16.903
I...GUESS.

38:18.948 --> 38:21.864
IT MEANS...THAT...

38:21.864 --> 38:24.693
YOU LOVE SOMEONE
SO MUCH...

38:24.693 --> 38:26.695
THAT YOU PUT THEM FIRST,

38:26.695 --> 38:28.306
IN FRONT OF EVERYTHING,

38:28.306 --> 38:30.220
INCLUDING YOURSELF.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.527
UH-HUH.

38:32.527 --> 38:35.748
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE
LIKE THAT?

38:35.748 --> 38:38.011
YOU WANT TO SHOW THEM.

38:38.011 --> 38:41.362
YOU WANT THEM TO...
TO KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.320
SO...

38:44.539 --> 38:47.760
SOMEDAY, IF THERE'S
SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY,

38:47.760 --> 38:50.284
EVEN IF YOU'RE SCARED
IT'S GONNA MAKE ME SAD,

38:50.284 --> 38:52.460
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.593
OK?

38:54.593 --> 38:58.074
'CAUSE THEN,
I'D KNOW HOW TO SHOW YOU.

38:58.074 --> 38:59.728
AND, UH...

38:59.728 --> 39:01.643
I'D THANK YOU FOR THAT.

39:01.643 --> 39:02.992
I'D NEVER BE MAD.

39:06.126 --> 39:07.083
YOU UNDERSTAND?

39:23.448 --> 39:26.407
I'M TRYING NOT TO SAY
IT FEELS LIKE OLD TIMES,
BUT...

39:26.407 --> 39:28.191
RIGHT.

39:28.191 --> 39:29.715
COME IN.

39:33.806 --> 39:34.894
OH, MAN.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.592
OH, MAN!

39:37.592 --> 39:39.072
NED.

39:39.072 --> 39:42.075
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
HEAR A FEW THINGS.

39:42.075 --> 39:45.121
JULIA ASKED ME
TO COME HERE
AS HER DOCTOR

39:45.121 --> 39:46.732
BECAUSE SHE'S AFRAID
THAT YOU MIGHT--

39:46.732 --> 39:47.733
NO, UH...

39:47.733 --> 39:49.343
LET ME.

39:52.781 --> 39:54.870
EVERYBODY KNOWS, NED.

39:56.219 --> 39:58.265
I CALLED THE SCHOOL,

39:58.265 --> 40:01.529
AND I CALLED
THE POLICE...

40:01.529 --> 40:04.184
AND THEY KNOW
YOU HIT ME,

40:04.184 --> 40:05.838
AND THEY KNOW
YOU HIT MAGGIE.

40:05.838 --> 40:08.580
AND--AND SO
YOU'RE GONNA BE WATCHED,

40:08.580 --> 40:10.451
AND, UM...

40:10.451 --> 40:13.802
IF YOU COME NEAR ME
OR CALL ME
OR CONTACT ME,

40:13.802 --> 40:15.935
YOU'RE GONNA BE
CHARGED WITH ASSAULT.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.460
JULIA--

40:19.460 --> 40:20.940
AND I'VE ALSO
CALLED YOUR PARENTS.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.289
WHAT?

40:22.289 --> 40:24.334
MY PARENTS? WH--

40:24.334 --> 40:27.076
SO THEY CAN FOLLOW UP
AND MAKE SURE
YOU GET HELP.

40:27.076 --> 40:28.513
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
GET TREATMENT, NED,

40:28.513 --> 40:31.211
AND YOU'RE GONNA STAY THERE
WITH DR. KESSEL OR WHOEVER--

40:31.211 --> 40:32.647
I DON'T CARE.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.825
WAIT.

40:36.825 --> 40:38.174
JULIA, WH--

40:38.174 --> 40:40.438
WHY?

40:40.438 --> 40:41.874
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE--

40:41.874 --> 40:43.310
NO. NED, YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:43.310 --> 40:45.007
I'M SICK OF IT.

40:45.007 --> 40:48.707
I'M SICK OF YOUR LIES,
AND I'M SICK OF YOUR GAMES,

40:48.707 --> 40:50.535
AND YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.537
AND I WOULD JUST
WALK AWAY FROM YOU,

40:52.537 --> 40:54.756
EXCEPT I SAW YOU
WITH THIS OTHER WOMAN.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.847
AND I CAN'T LET IT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

40:58.847 --> 41:01.633
I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN
TO ANYONE ELSE
WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

41:03.417 --> 41:05.985
BUT...C-CAN I--

41:05.985 --> 41:08.422
ARE YOU DONE?
CAN I SAY SOMETHING NOW?

41:08.422 --> 41:10.076
SURE YOU CAN.

41:10.076 --> 41:14.210
AS LONG AS YOUR REALIZE
NO ONE'S LISTENING.

41:32.228 --> 41:34.013
I PACKED UP ALL OF
HIS SCHOOL STUFF,

41:34.013 --> 41:36.276
AND, UH,
YOU CAN STOP BY

41:36.276 --> 41:38.670
AND GET THE REST
OF HIS CLOTHES
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

41:38.670 --> 41:41.847
HE'S GOT A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT ON, UH...
MONDAY,

41:41.847 --> 41:44.153
4:00, I THINK.
OK, AND, UH,

41:44.153 --> 41:45.503
DON'T FORGET
HIS SWIM LEAGUE.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.939
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

41:46.939 --> 41:47.940
OK.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.245
I SHOULD
GET BACK HOME.

41:49.245 --> 41:50.159
OK. UM...

41:52.858 --> 41:54.207
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

41:54.207 --> 41:55.469
I KNOW.

41:55.469 --> 41:57.689
SO I'M JUST GONNA--

41:57.689 --> 41:58.690
WELL...

41:58.690 --> 42:01.649
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

42:01.649 --> 42:03.521
WE SAID A LOT OF STUFF.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.436
THAT'S RIGHT.

42:06.436 --> 42:07.525
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN--

42:07.525 --> 42:08.787
YEAH, YOU DID.

42:08.787 --> 42:10.528
YOU MEANT
WHAT YOU SAID.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.138
AND SO DID I.

42:12.138 --> 42:14.619
SO, UM...

42:14.619 --> 42:17.099
NOW'S JUST NOT
THE RIGHT TIME.

42:17.099 --> 42:18.318
OK.

42:18.318 --> 42:21.190
JUST, UH...

42:21.190 --> 42:22.931
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM.
