<i>The House will come
to order for a roll call vote</i>

00:19.666 --> 00:22.701
<i>on the matter of who will be the
President of the United States.</i>

00:22.702 --> 00:25.036
Senator William O'Brien from Arizona...

00:25.038 --> 00:27.939
All right, here we go. Alabama
first in the alphabet,

00:27.940 --> 00:29.739
last in every other fucking thing.

00:29.742 --> 00:32.143
I believe it's number
one in easiest state

00:32.145 --> 00:35.079
- to get away with murdering a black guy.
- Come on, come on.

00:35.081 --> 00:38.548
<i>Alabama casts its vote
for President Selina Meyer.</i>

00:38.551 --> 00:40.084
That's my town!

00:40.085 --> 00:42.051
Ooh, bam-a-lama ding dong!

00:42.054 --> 00:43.786
Yeah... oh, Catherine.

00:43.789 --> 00:46.823
Would you please give it
a rest with that camera?

00:46.825 --> 00:49.259
<i>My name is Catherine Meyer.</i>

00:49.261 --> 00:52.161
<i>I've spent my entire
life in the public eye.</i>

00:52.164 --> 00:54.896
<i>While the public will always
remember me as the little girl</i>

00:54.899 --> 00:57.600
<i>who fell off the stage
twice in one evening,</i>

00:57.603 --> 01:01.438
<i>I'm a grown woman now with my
own passions and interests.</i>

01:03.173 --> 01:05.573
<i>One of the biggest things
that ever happened in my life</i>

01:05.575 --> 01:08.743
<i>and my family's life happened
when the House of Representatives</i>

01:08.745 --> 01:11.447
<i>voted to decide the presidency
of the United States</i>

01:11.448 --> 01:14.450
<i>for the first time in 140 years.</i>

01:14.451 --> 01:16.885
<i>Almost two months to the day earlier,</i>

01:16.887 --> 01:19.254
<i>the American people voted for president,</i>

01:19.257 --> 01:22.956
<i>but that night ended in an
historic electoral college tie</i>

01:22.959 --> 01:27.995
<i>between Senator Bill O'Brien and the
sitting president Selina Meyer, my mom.</i>

01:27.996 --> 01:30.164
<i>It meant that the House
of Representatives</i>

01:30.167 --> 01:33.168
<i>needed to vote to break the
tie and choose a president.</i>

01:33.170 --> 01:36.304
My bowling coach used to say a tie
was like kissing your sister.

01:36.305 --> 01:39.406
Yeah, well, this feels like my
sister took a shit on my chest.

01:43.278 --> 01:45.278
<i>In order to tell this story,</i>

01:45.281 --> 01:47.281
<i>I have to go back to where it all began,</i>

01:47.283 --> 01:50.417
<i>the day after the presidential
election was tied.</i>

01:52.287 --> 01:54.887
I do not give my consent
to have my likeness

01:54.889 --> 01:56.754
appear in this or any other film.

01:56.757 --> 01:58.691
<i>The president will see you now.</i>

01:58.692 --> 02:01.260
<i>I set out to
make a film about the tie,</i>

02:01.262 --> 02:03.028
<i>but somewhere along the way,</i>

02:03.030 --> 02:05.864
<i>I ended up discovering
something about myself.</i>

02:05.865 --> 02:10.336
I'm gonna have to have approval over
all of this footage, Catherine, okay?

02:10.336 --> 02:12.169
Okay, we can talk about that after.

02:12.171 --> 02:13.504
<i>When did you first know</i>

02:13.507 --> 02:15.574
<i>that you wanted to be president?</i>

02:15.575 --> 02:17.241
<i>It was 1973.</i>

02:17.243 --> 02:19.176
- Catherine, out.
- <i>I was a very little girl</i>

02:19.179 --> 02:22.079
and Mother wasn't "feeling well."

02:22.081 --> 02:25.349
Daddy asked me to be his date

02:25.352 --> 02:28.086
for President Nixon's inaugural ball.

02:28.087 --> 02:32.723
Daddy did a lot of
business with Bebe Rebozo.

02:32.724 --> 02:36.093
President Nixon entered the room

02:36.094 --> 02:40.663
and, you know, he had his bow tie

02:40.665 --> 02:43.800
and his eyebrows.

02:43.801 --> 02:47.069
Daddy leaned in to me and he said,

02:47.070 --> 02:51.006
"You know, a lot of
people don't like Nixon,

02:51.008 --> 02:54.377
but by God, they respect him.

02:54.378 --> 02:56.445
And that's you, peanut."

03:03.653 --> 03:05.253
<i>- Delaware?</i>
- Come on, come on.

03:05.256 --> 03:08.723
Delaware votes for
President Selina Meyer.

03:08.725 --> 03:11.693
- Oh!
- I don't want to jinx things, guys,

03:11.694 --> 03:13.794
but I think maybe we should
start making our list

03:13.796 --> 03:15.631
of who I'm going to punish when I win.

03:15.633 --> 03:17.532
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

03:17.533 --> 03:20.134
I went home with a congressional
fan girl last night.

03:20.135 --> 03:21.935
I don't have my car. I
think I'm in Maryland.

03:21.937 --> 03:23.771
Well, first of all, sir,
congratulations are in order.

03:23.772 --> 03:25.938
Shh! She's got a fucking parrot,
and if the parrot wakes up,

03:25.941 --> 03:27.875
the parrot's gonna make
noise and wake up her mom.

03:27.877 --> 03:30.043
- Has the vote started yet?
- Yes, Delaware just voted.

03:30.045 --> 03:32.646
Shit. Shit. Okay, you gotta come get me.

03:32.649 --> 03:34.414
Okay, just drop a pin
in Apple Maps and...

03:34.417 --> 03:36.082
I don't know how to drop a fucking pin.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.651
Well, it's a really intuitive feature.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.786
- Do you have iOS 9.2.3?
- Shut up.

03:39.788 --> 03:42.087
Bring me a change of clothes
and come and get me.

03:42.090 --> 03:44.956
<i>The day after the
tie, the stock markets crashed,</i>

03:44.959 --> 03:48.093
<i>but my mom did everything she
could to get them back on track.</i>

03:48.096 --> 03:51.397
This afternoon, I asked Tom James

03:51.400 --> 03:55.401
to do his country the honor of
stepping up to serve as economy czar

03:55.402 --> 03:58.870
<i>and to my absolute delight, he said yes.</i>

03:58.872 --> 04:01.372
<i>Did you ever play sports?</i>

04:01.375 --> 04:03.908
<i>Remember how no one ever
wanted to play catcher?</i>

04:03.911 --> 04:07.712
Playing catcher is kind of
like being the economy czar.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.782
There's not a lot of glory,
but a lot of squatting.

04:10.783 --> 04:13.116
A lot of asses in your face.

04:13.118 --> 04:14.977
<i> Thank you
so much, Senator James.</i>

04:15.002 --> 04:15.885
You're very welcome.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.923
- How's it going?
- It's going very well, thanks.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.492
- And Bob's your uncle.
- Knock, knock, future calling.

04:21.494 --> 04:23.528
Cheese, please, Louise.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.529
Gentlemen, you know the first daughter.

04:25.531 --> 04:26.314
We do.

04:26.341 --> 04:28.665
She's interviewing me
for a college project.

04:28.667 --> 04:30.500
No, it's a doc.

04:30.502 --> 04:33.704
Oh, yeah, like one of those movies
for people who like to be sad.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.706
<i>What do you think
of the electoral tie?</i>

04:35.707 --> 04:38.040
You know, at night when I
dare to close my eyes,

04:38.043 --> 04:40.343
I dream about your mother losing

04:40.346 --> 04:42.879
and then coming upon her
holding a cardboard sign

04:42.880 --> 04:44.579
at the bottom of a highway exit ramp.

04:44.581 --> 04:46.581
Now, if I were Tom
James, I would just try

04:46.584 --> 04:49.183
to get three states to abstain and
then it would go to the Senate,

04:49.185 --> 04:51.220
serving the president the
most abject humiliation

04:51.221 --> 04:52.887
in the history of the United States.

04:52.889 --> 04:54.689
Oh, you know what the
cardboard sign says?

04:54.692 --> 04:56.191
<i>What does it say?</i>

04:56.192 --> 04:58.860
It says, "I'm so sorry, Bill Ericsson."

04:58.862 --> 05:00.862
<i>What if you
lose the presidency?</i>

05:00.865 --> 05:02.596
Well, I'll tell you something,

05:02.598 --> 05:05.098
you can't think that way.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.033
That's what Mother always said.

05:07.036 --> 05:09.838
When you have those kinds
of negative feelings,

05:09.839 --> 05:13.708
you just pick them up and
you stuff them in your box

05:13.709 --> 05:17.245
and you close it down tight
and you take that box

05:17.247 --> 05:19.579
and you shove it way
back here in your...

05:19.581 --> 05:23.449
in the corner of your head
and swallow that key.

05:23.451 --> 05:26.286
And then, poof, they're gone.

05:26.288 --> 05:29.355
And then that's it. And
it works, too, sweetie.

05:29.358 --> 05:31.725
That's something that
Mother told me that works.

05:31.726 --> 05:35.127
Okay, you pour the hot water
into the pot, all right?

05:35.129 --> 05:36.928
Swirl it around a bit.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.564
And then you pour it out, okay?

05:39.567 --> 05:40.932
That's called hot in the pot.

05:40.935 --> 05:42.468
Now this is a special blend I've got.

05:42.470 --> 05:43.870
It's got chamomile and rose hips

05:43.872 --> 05:45.404
and some other little
special ingredients

05:45.406 --> 05:46.838
that I'm not gonna tell you on camera.

05:46.841 --> 05:48.507
<i>Um, my question was</i>

05:48.509 --> 05:51.175
<i>what's your take on
the financial crisis.</i>

05:51.177 --> 05:53.512
Oh.

05:53.514 --> 05:56.079
I just think they ran out of money.

05:56.081 --> 05:57.915
They should probably just print more.

05:57.918 --> 05:59.483
I don't know why it's
been such a big issue.

05:59.485 --> 06:02.286
Okay, guys, when are we gonna
fire Mike, by the way?

06:02.288 --> 06:06.524
Because it is seriously just one
fuckup after fuckup with him.

06:06.526 --> 06:08.026
Yeah, right after the inauguration,

06:08.028 --> 06:10.694
we'll show Mr. McShittock the door.

06:10.696 --> 06:12.963
<i>Hey.</i>

06:12.964 --> 06:14.298
Hi.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.565
I love my job.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.334
Oh, my God, I want to do it forever.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.036
Especially because this
is the kind of job

06:19.038 --> 06:21.170
that I've gotten better at every year.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.740
And it's also the kind of job

06:22.742 --> 06:24.875
that you need to be fast on your feet.

06:24.877 --> 06:27.108
You need to be quick and
you need to sort of,

06:27.110 --> 06:31.146
uh, I don't even know what the word is.

06:31.149 --> 06:33.382
We're in the process of
converting the guest bedroom

06:33.384 --> 06:36.218
into a nursery for our
arriving Chinese angel.

06:36.220 --> 06:39.288
And Ta-da! We went with a
Winnie the Pooh knockoff.

06:39.290 --> 06:41.858
It's made in China so Ellen
will feel right at home.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.858
I think he's called Happy Sun Bear.

06:43.860 --> 06:45.927
So much cheaper. And we've
checked the room for lead,

06:45.930 --> 06:48.697
so there's... actually, I need...
I'm supposed to check...

06:48.699 --> 06:52.000
I have to get a guy to check the room
for lead, but we will check for lead.

06:52.002 --> 06:53.935
<i>In mid-November,
my mom's team</i>

06:53.937 --> 06:55.903
<i>challenged the vote totals in Nevada,</i>

06:55.906 --> 06:58.639
<i>which meant the tie might
not be a tie any longer.</i>

06:58.641 --> 07:00.375
- I've changed my mind.
- About what?

07:00.377 --> 07:02.309
Send me to Nevada. I want the job.

07:02.310 --> 07:05.144
Oh, but so does Candi Caruso.

07:05.146 --> 07:07.380
And even though, and I quote,

07:07.382 --> 07:12.086
the fact that I'm a woman means we will
no longer have any women presidents

07:12.088 --> 07:14.254
because we've already tried
one and she fucking sucked.

07:14.255 --> 07:18.024
Please, please, please.

07:19.595 --> 07:21.194
Well, I'll give you this...

07:21.196 --> 07:24.029
Candi Caruso would not
eat this amount of shit.

07:24.031 --> 07:26.064
Unless afterward she went
into a bathroom stall

07:26.067 --> 07:27.766
and used the old
two-fingered wood chipper.

07:27.769 --> 07:30.269
Why would I want to stand next to a twig

07:30.271 --> 07:32.338
like that all day when I
can stand next to you?

07:32.340 --> 07:35.139
<i>What would
you do if you lost?</i>

07:35.141 --> 07:37.108
You keep harping on this.

07:37.110 --> 07:39.677
But I'll tell you something,
I have lost elections.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.380
I lost the first time
that I ran for Congress.

07:42.382 --> 07:44.582
They called me Selina Vanderbilt

07:44.584 --> 07:47.052
as if the Vanderbilts
had any money left.

07:47.053 --> 07:51.588
Anyway, after that, you know,
I went to Arizona to a spa

07:51.591 --> 07:53.725
and I took stock

07:53.726 --> 07:55.726
and I asked myself some
tough questions...

07:55.728 --> 07:59.463
<i>Wait, is that when you had
your nervous breakdown?</i>

07:59.465 --> 08:03.401
No, no, I did not... no, I
went to a spa, sweetie.

08:03.403 --> 08:05.569
<i>No, when Rosa had to take care of me</i>

08:05.572 --> 08:07.872
<i>because you went to a mental hospital.</i>

08:07.874 --> 08:10.874
No, darling, I didn't go
to a mental hospital.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.709
I went to a spa.

08:12.711 --> 08:15.612
Is this how this is all
going to be in your movie?

08:15.613 --> 08:18.213
<i>Massachusetts
votes for Selina Meyer.</i>

08:18.216 --> 08:20.283
- 11-10, O'Brien.
- I just talked to Furlong.

08:20.285 --> 08:22.653
He said everything's under
control plus a bunch of stuff

08:22.654 --> 08:24.555
about assholes and jizz
and my pretty mouth.

08:24.557 --> 08:26.755
Richard, where is Jonah?

08:26.757 --> 08:29.391
-<i> Morning!</i>
- Shut the fuck up, Richard.

08:29.393 --> 08:31.894
<i>Well, you can't scream
that in this neighborhood.</i>

08:31.896 --> 08:35.364
I couldn't find my clothes. I had to
get this out of her dad's closet.

08:35.365 --> 08:37.633
She already told me she was
a senior at Georgetown.

08:37.634 --> 08:39.601
Turns out she meant
Georgetown Day School.

08:39.604 --> 08:41.537
- <i>Oh.</i>
- She's on the math team.

08:41.538 --> 08:43.705
- Are you filming me?
- <i>Might be a crime.</i>

08:43.706 --> 08:47.375
<i>Oh, yeah, Catherine asked me to help
assist her with documenting the vote.</i>

08:47.376 --> 08:49.610
<i>Plus she taught me how to
make sure the camera is on.</i>

08:49.613 --> 08:52.346
Oh, okay, good, well, then
on this historic day...

08:52.347 --> 08:54.448
-<i> Also, the president's on the line.</i>
- Oh, motherfuck.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.283
<i>- Jonah, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

08:56.286 --> 09:00.253
You listen to me, all right?
You are already dead.

09:00.254 --> 09:03.791
What you do now you do for your family.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.659
<i>You get yourself in there
and you vote for me!</i>

09:06.662 --> 09:11.364
Is my entire presidency about to have its
neck snapped by Congressman Lennie here?

09:11.365 --> 09:14.234
Call all friendlies. Let's
slow this thing down.

09:14.235 --> 09:17.470
The great state of Michigan

09:17.471 --> 09:20.706
would like to cast its vote.

09:20.708 --> 09:23.875
But first, let us pray.

09:23.878 --> 09:25.778
<i>My mom lost
the Nevada recount,</i>

09:25.779 --> 09:28.648
<i>but that was overshadowed
by some terrible news.</i>

09:28.649 --> 09:30.249
<i>My dear mee-maw died.</i>

09:30.250 --> 09:32.451
This is the Oval Office.

09:32.452 --> 09:35.921
<i>Wow, three generations
of Meyer women.</i>

09:35.923 --> 09:38.523
<i>It's like the best episode
of "Falcon Crest" ever.</i>

09:38.524 --> 09:41.659
Mother, this right here

09:41.662 --> 09:44.129
is the Resolute desk.

09:44.130 --> 09:46.331
And it was used by FDR

09:46.332 --> 09:49.366
and now by me, Mother, your daughter.

09:51.437 --> 09:55.072
I do hope you'll wait
till your hair grows

09:55.073 --> 09:57.341
to have your portrait painted.

09:59.645 --> 10:01.211
This has been fun.

10:01.212 --> 10:02.947
- She looks like a boy.
- Okay.

10:02.948 --> 10:07.150
It doesn't seem that deep. Look.

10:07.153 --> 10:08.851
Oh, yeah, that's not that deep.

10:08.854 --> 10:11.386
Excuse me, should this be deeper?

10:11.389 --> 10:12.889
<i>Have you ever
lost a grandparent?</i>

10:12.890 --> 10:15.524
All my grandparents are dead.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.293
Wait. Um, no.

10:17.294 --> 10:19.461
One or two might still be alive.

10:19.463 --> 10:22.298
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:22.299 --> 10:24.500
Good to be back in good old DC,

10:24.501 --> 10:26.333
away from the greed, the
money, and the hookers.

10:26.336 --> 10:28.903
Listen, um...

10:28.905 --> 10:30.838
...so, if you're not
doing anything later...

10:30.841 --> 10:34.609
Jesus fucking Christ. You got to
tell your sister to stop calling me.

10:36.746 --> 10:40.347
Hmm. Hey, girl.

10:40.350 --> 10:43.384
So now as a person in politics under 40,

10:43.385 --> 10:45.653
you just... wait, cut.

10:45.654 --> 10:49.255
<i>Actually, I'm the one
that's supposed to say cut.</i>

10:49.258 --> 10:51.926
No, no, no, I'm saying it because
we're starting that over.

10:51.927 --> 10:54.128
Ready? Action.

10:54.129 --> 10:58.264
As a person in politics who's younger
than most of her... cut, cut.

10:58.267 --> 11:00.533
-<i> No, Amy, please don't actually say...</i>
- Action.

11:00.534 --> 11:03.669
We were really disappointed about
the Chinese adoption sanctions.

11:03.672 --> 11:06.239
That... but on the bright side,

11:06.240 --> 11:08.674
I turned the nursery
into a man cave for me.

11:08.677 --> 11:12.378
I mean, surround sound,
55-inch television screen.

11:12.379 --> 11:14.880
It actually cost the same as
the kid, so it works out.

11:14.883 --> 11:18.549
I can't wait for Wendy to see it.
She is gonna...

11:18.552 --> 11:20.952
possibly like it.

11:20.955 --> 11:23.081
<i> Do you like
working at the White House?</i>

11:23.105 --> 11:23.789
I do, yes.

11:23.791 --> 11:26.116
<i> Have you enjoyed working
for the president?</i>

11:26.142 --> 11:26.892
Yes.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.293
-<i> Were you ever frightened for your life?</i>
- No.

11:29.296 --> 11:31.721
<i> Are you really ready to take
a bullet for the president?</i>

11:31.748 --> 11:32.532
Yes.

11:32.533 --> 11:34.631
-<i> Have you ever killed a man?</i>
- Can't say.

11:34.634 --> 11:36.868
<i>Do you think my mom's a good president?</i>

11:39.605 --> 11:42.173
- Yes.
- <i>That was perfect.</i>

11:42.174 --> 11:43.443
<i>Everybody else that
I've interviewed just</i>

11:43.469 --> 11:44.743
<i>talks about themselves
all the time and...</i>

11:44.745 --> 11:47.411
Um, would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

11:47.413 --> 11:49.346
<i>Oh, yeah, I... I would love that.</i>

11:49.349 --> 11:52.349
<i>I should say that... you
know that I'm not gay?</i>

11:52.350 --> 11:54.551
- Really?
- <i>Yeah. Well, I...</i>

11:54.552 --> 11:56.754
-<i> I didn't mean that to come across...</i>
- No, it didn't.

11:56.755 --> 11:59.889
You know, it's just I
assumed just because,

11:59.892 --> 12:02.158
you know, the way you
dress and stare at me.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.094
<i>Well, I mean, I like guys.</i>

12:04.096 --> 12:06.629
<i>The Thanksgiving death
of Congressman Harry Sherman</i>

12:06.631 --> 12:10.133
<i>put the key state of New Hampshire
back in play for the House vote.</i>

12:10.134 --> 12:14.070
<i>I followed candidate Jonah Ryan as
he campaigned in his home state.</i>

12:14.072 --> 12:17.306
How am I doing? Eating so much
pussy I'm shitting clit, son.

12:17.307 --> 12:18.407
- Hey!
- What?

12:18.408 --> 12:19.975
This is an elementary school!

12:19.977 --> 12:22.311
Watch your spewing mouth, you animal!

12:22.312 --> 12:23.979
Hey, you are gonna pay for that.

12:23.980 --> 12:25.480
- That is assault.
- Out. Out.

12:25.481 --> 12:27.048
That is assault. You are witnesses.

12:27.049 --> 12:28.950
- This is assault!
- Right now, get out.

12:28.951 --> 12:31.820
Hello there. I'm Jonah Ryan.

12:31.822 --> 12:33.989
Ah, fuck.

12:33.990 --> 12:37.491
Mothercunt. Piece of shit.

12:37.494 --> 12:39.326
Fuck you. Fuck you.

12:40.429 --> 12:42.629
Ah, fuck.

12:42.630 --> 12:44.164
Careful. Careful. Careful.

12:44.167 --> 12:46.834
I think the problem is that
you lack upper body strength.

12:46.836 --> 12:48.201
Oh!

12:48.203 --> 12:49.903
Why am I even chopping the fucking wood?

12:49.905 --> 12:51.471
It's the 21st century.

12:51.472 --> 12:53.373
We don't even use this shit anymore.

12:56.144 --> 12:57.744
Worked fine.

12:57.745 --> 13:01.080
Ah, and I grew up right here

13:01.081 --> 13:03.149
in the awesome state of New Hampshire.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.418
I hitched my wagon to a
shooting star named Jonah Ryan.

13:06.421 --> 13:08.153
Well, maybe I should say comet

13:08.155 --> 13:10.556
because shooting stars burn
out and he never will.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.458
The only downside is that
I'll probably have to miss

13:13.461 --> 13:15.961
my Gilbert & Sullivan
Society annual show.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.696
You know, operetta is my passion.

13:17.697 --> 13:21.833
♪ If you want to know who we are ♪

13:21.836 --> 13:26.104
♪ We are gentlemen of Japan... ♪

13:29.275 --> 13:31.875
...home to Motown,

13:31.878 --> 13:35.546
aka Hitsville USA,

13:35.548 --> 13:38.682
would like to cast its vote

13:38.683 --> 13:41.818
for President Selina...

13:41.821 --> 13:44.322
Catherine Meyer.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.389
Michigan votes for Selina Meyer.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.859
- Jesus, Richard, please drive faster.
<i>- Minnesota?</i>

13:48.860 --> 13:51.327
-<i> If you held the camera...</i>
- I'm not gonna hold the camera, Richard.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.528
How would I be on the camera...

13:54.248 --> 13:56.298
Jesus Christ, Richard! You
could have killed me.

13:56.301 --> 13:58.000
Can't you do two simple things at once?

13:58.003 --> 13:59.936
<i>I just thank God I didn't
hit those schoolchildren.</i>

13:59.937 --> 14:02.205
Who gives a fuck about them? Go! Go!

14:02.206 --> 14:04.506
<i> Well, actually, the car won't start.</i>

14:04.509 --> 14:07.243
- <i>Maybe call an Uber.</i>
- We can't call an Uber.

14:07.245 --> 14:09.778
I've been banned for life
because I have a low rating.

14:09.779 --> 14:11.913
Missouri abstains from the vote.

14:11.916 --> 14:13.849
- Missouri abstained?
- Abstained?

14:13.850 --> 14:16.150
This is Tom and he's making a move

14:16.153 --> 14:18.039
like some kind of grand
fucking chess master.

14:18.066 --> 14:18.821
<i> Right.</i>

14:18.822 --> 14:22.323
Stalemate his endgame. Shades
of Karpov versus Kasparov.

14:22.326 --> 14:24.792
- Oh, who's that for, Kent?
- Guys, Missouri's gonna abstain.

14:24.793 --> 14:26.995
Tom just needs to make sure
that no one gets to 26

14:26.996 --> 14:29.364
and then get his buddy Marwood to
make sure there's not another vote.

14:29.365 --> 14:31.399
<i>- That's it.</i>
- Where is Jonah, folks?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.600
Motherfucker! They're taking a Lyft now?

14:36.373 --> 14:39.039
<i>- Time to wake up.</i>
- Stop.

14:39.042 --> 14:42.109
You big lesbo.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.778
And what's it to you? I
think it's time to wake up.

14:44.779 --> 14:47.813
<i>Suddenly everything
in my life made sense.</i>

14:47.816 --> 14:49.481
<i>Actually, I got a question for you.</i>

14:49.484 --> 14:52.052
Is it weird going hallway to hallway

14:52.053 --> 14:54.821
- with your mom's twin?
- <i>What?</i>

14:54.822 --> 14:57.623
To... never mind.

14:57.625 --> 15:00.725
<i>Do you think about what
you'll do if my mother doesn't win?</i>

15:00.727 --> 15:03.495
God, I have no idea.
What else am I gonna do?

15:03.496 --> 15:05.130
Go out and see the world?

15:05.133 --> 15:08.801
I don't even like looking
out my window, so...

15:08.802 --> 15:11.303
I really... I don't know.

15:11.306 --> 15:14.105
Ben, you home.

15:14.106 --> 15:15.740
It's the spouse.

15:15.741 --> 15:18.309
Hey, sweetie. Hi.

15:18.312 --> 15:22.113
Um, Joyce, this is the
president's daughter Catherine.

15:22.115 --> 15:24.182
Catherine, this is my wife Joyce.

15:24.183 --> 15:26.551
- Nice to meet you.
- What a surprise.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.514
I thought you and the kids
were on vacation this week.

15:28.539 --> 15:29.620
Yeah, that was last month.

15:29.621 --> 15:32.588
<i>Joyce, she took care of me
after my third heart attack.</i>

15:32.591 --> 15:35.326
<i>My second wife was a nurse as well.</i>

15:35.327 --> 15:37.626
I guess I have a thing for nurses, huh?

15:37.629 --> 15:39.963
Yeah, but I his best nurse.

15:39.966 --> 15:43.299
These Precious Moments figurines
are a very good investment.

15:43.302 --> 15:44.701
Would you care for a drink?

15:44.702 --> 15:47.736
Hi, yeah, I'm trying to
reach Charlie Baird.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.672
This is a friend of his, Gary Walsh.

15:49.673 --> 15:53.009
Oh, what's the... what
is this concerning?

15:53.010 --> 15:54.809
Um, hanging out?

15:54.812 --> 15:57.346
_

15:57.349 --> 15:58.880
_

15:58.883 --> 16:03.251
_

16:03.254 --> 16:05.086
These are my compatriots.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.222
We are a historically
Spanish-speaking motorcycle club

16:08.225 --> 16:12.826
which has been under a great deal
of unfair legal scrutiny lately.

16:12.828 --> 16:15.529
This is our president, El Cabeza.

16:15.532 --> 16:17.831
<i>Hola, chica. ¿Cómo estás?</i>

16:19.602 --> 16:21.235
_

16:21.259 --> 16:23.730
_

16:23.772 --> 16:25.806
<i>I find that my
involvement in the club</i>

16:25.807 --> 16:28.042
<i>keeps the internecine skirmishes</i>

16:28.043 --> 16:29.942
of Washington in perspective.

16:32.148 --> 16:34.947
Yello.

16:34.950 --> 16:37.650
- Hey, how far out are you?
- We're at security.

16:37.653 --> 16:40.120
Get the Hunchback of Notre
Hampshire down to the floor.

16:40.121 --> 16:42.522
Well, we've reached a
little bit of a kerfuffle.

16:42.524 --> 16:44.490
I'd say even more of a kerfuffle.

16:44.493 --> 16:46.259
Like a snafu approaching quagmire.

16:46.260 --> 16:48.461
Jonah Ryan. Just Google me. Google me.

16:48.462 --> 16:50.996
- Come on, fucking Google me.
- Calm down, sir.

16:50.999 --> 16:52.065
Jesus Christ.

16:53.335 --> 16:56.434
- Hey!
- No!

16:56.437 --> 16:58.403
We're hanging on by a thread,
but if everyone votes

16:58.405 --> 17:00.272
the way we think they're
gonna vote, we'll win.

17:00.274 --> 17:02.240
Yeah, that's the least
reassuring sentence

17:02.243 --> 17:04.742
I've heard since "It's
okay, it's just the tip."

17:04.743 --> 17:06.678
It's looking tighter
than Will's own butthole

17:06.680 --> 17:08.279
when he's got his finger jammed up there

17:08.281 --> 17:10.582
watching "Bad News Bears"
while he jerks off.

17:10.584 --> 17:13.351
- How tight is that, Will?
- It's very tight, sir.

17:13.353 --> 17:15.719
Yeah, but I wouldn't take
down the tampon dispenser

17:15.721 --> 17:17.488
in the Oval Office bathroom just yet.

17:17.490 --> 17:19.656
<i>How will you
feel if my mom loses?</i>

17:19.659 --> 17:22.226
If your mom loses? I'll miss her.

17:22.228 --> 17:24.127
She's a pretty classy lady.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.195
She's the only person in this
town who really gets me.

17:26.199 --> 17:29.599
Oh, so I will see you tomorrow night.

17:29.602 --> 17:31.268
- Yes.
- Yes, indeed.

17:31.269 --> 17:33.001
<i>As the vote got closer,</i>

17:33.003 --> 17:35.872
<i>the tension in the White House
ratcheted up even further.</i>

17:35.874 --> 17:37.606
Run.

17:37.608 --> 17:39.808
Door.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.679
So what the fuck is Tom up to?

17:48.685 --> 17:51.019
Sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

17:53.223 --> 17:55.057
Yes?

17:55.058 --> 17:58.961
I was just checking to see if there
was another meeting about me.

17:58.962 --> 18:01.196
Not today.

18:01.199 --> 18:02.663
Okay.

18:05.602 --> 18:08.903
Guys, Mike is a moron. Jesus Christ!

18:08.904 --> 18:10.980
I can't wait until
after the inauguration.

18:11.006 --> 18:11.672
No.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.308
I'm sure he's an inspiration
to other slow adults,

18:14.310 --> 18:15.977
but it's enough already with Mike.

18:15.979 --> 18:17.612
I'll start lining up interviews.

18:17.614 --> 18:19.314
Since the surrogate's pregnant,

18:19.316 --> 18:22.015
we've converted the man
cave back into a baby cave.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.317
And this thing here was
already hard mounted.

18:24.319 --> 18:27.019
It's pretty solid, so I think I'm
just gonna leave it here, you know?

18:27.021 --> 18:29.323
That way, we can play
educational stuff for the baby.

18:29.325 --> 18:32.192
You know, Barney, nature
films, nothing harmful.

18:32.193 --> 18:35.894
Oh, God, check for lead. Note to self.

18:35.896 --> 18:38.564
<i>So what's up
with all the hockey stuff?</i>

18:46.673 --> 18:49.040
<i> Let's go in here. We can
talk privately in here, Tom.</i>

18:49.042 --> 18:50.185
Shit.

18:50.211 --> 18:53.613
<i> I've been waiting for
this for a very long time.</i>

18:53.615 --> 18:56.878
-<i> Okay, how stupid are you,
you motherfucking snake?</i>

18:56.903 --> 18:58.048
<i> Fuck.</i>

18:58.050 --> 19:00.384
<i>- All right, I wanted to fuck you!</i>
<i>- That's right!</i>

19:00.386 --> 19:02.554
<i>And now you're trying to
fuck me again tonight.</i>

19:02.556 --> 19:04.422
<i>No, I am fucking you tonight!</i>

19:04.423 --> 19:07.959
<i>No, I'm gonna fuck you!</i>

19:09.382 --> 19:13.463
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, please.

19:13.465 --> 19:16.333
<i>Have you thought about
what you'll do if my mother loses?</i>

19:16.335 --> 19:18.368
We'll be fine.

19:18.371 --> 19:19.238
Sorry.

19:19.262 --> 19:21.837
Yeah, hi. It's this
couch right here, yeah.

19:21.839 --> 19:23.606
I mean, whether we're in the White House

19:23.608 --> 19:26.242
or we're antiquing in Charleston

19:26.244 --> 19:30.046
or we're on the pink,
sandy beaches of Barbuda,

19:30.048 --> 19:32.582
you know, it's like we'll be fine.

19:32.584 --> 19:35.484
- Where do you want this?
- Just not here.

19:35.487 --> 19:38.153
We haven't even been to Italy.

19:38.155 --> 19:40.088
My father was a navy guy,

19:40.090 --> 19:42.525
so we travelled the world quite a bit.

19:42.527 --> 19:47.563
I am very excited to
be secretary of state.

19:47.565 --> 19:49.498
<i>What about
Congressman Graves?</i>

19:49.500 --> 19:52.733
<i>I thought that he was doing it.</i>

19:52.736 --> 19:53.968
No.

19:53.970 --> 19:56.371
Um...

19:56.373 --> 19:58.772
did I tell you I have a
photograph of my father?

19:58.775 --> 20:00.808
<i>- New Hampshire?</i>
<i>- Where is he?</i>

20:00.810 --> 20:03.911
The state of New Hampshire
begs the floor's indulgence.

20:03.913 --> 20:06.012
We are still missing a
member of our delegation.

20:06.015 --> 20:07.865
I thought that you
said he was at security.

20:07.891 --> 20:08.481
He was.

20:08.483 --> 20:11.085
He's 18 feet tall. How could
he have gone missing?

20:11.086 --> 20:12.752
- Jesus. Catherine, move.
-<i> Ow!</i>

20:15.891 --> 20:17.490
Oh, other exit.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.894
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no!

20:21.895 --> 20:23.946
Oh, you want it open? Sorry.
Okay, I got it.

20:23.972 --> 20:24.654
Fuck!

20:26.634 --> 20:28.201
<i>- I'm so excited.</i>

20:28.202 --> 20:30.303
- Oh!
- She's here? Oh.

20:30.305 --> 20:31.871
Hi.

20:31.873 --> 20:35.074
- Hi, Mom.
- Welcome home. Oh!

20:35.076 --> 20:37.442
- Catherine, this is my mom, my dad.
- Hi.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.612
<i>- Hi. Hi.</i>
- Grandma. Grandpa.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.384
This is Catherine Meyer,
my, uh, work friend.

20:42.410 --> 20:43.648
<i> What?</i>

20:43.651 --> 20:44.982
<i>Welcome to Montana.</i>

20:44.984 --> 20:48.153
We had a fight.

20:50.156 --> 20:53.291
I trust the American people
to make the right decision.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.759
<i>What if you think they're
gonna make a certain decision</i>

20:55.761 --> 20:58.429
<i>and they make a different decision
and then it completely derails</i>

20:58.431 --> 21:00.632
<i>what you thought was gonna happen?</i>

21:00.634 --> 21:03.367
-<i> And then your plans are different.</i>
- Oh, honey, don't cry.

21:03.369 --> 21:06.703
Mommy's gonna get elected, honey.

21:06.705 --> 21:09.673
<i>Marjorie and I broke up.</i>

21:09.675 --> 21:12.541
Oh. Oh.

21:12.544 --> 21:16.480
That's terrible.

21:16.481 --> 21:19.316
- Do you need a tissue?
- <i>No, I'm fine.</i>

21:19.317 --> 21:20.950
Yeah, no, you do.

21:20.951 --> 21:24.053
Honey. Oh, you look terrible!

21:24.055 --> 21:26.455
You look terrible.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.090
Oh...

21:28.093 --> 21:29.857
Honey, let me tell you something.

21:29.859 --> 21:34.529
Marjorie is insufferable, okay?

21:34.531 --> 21:39.134
There are other... there are other
fish in the sapphic sea, babe.

21:39.135 --> 21:43.338
I mean, seriously, there are more
lesbians in the Secret Service, even.

21:43.340 --> 21:45.472
- You feel better?
- Yeah, a little bit.

21:45.474 --> 21:47.308
Good girl. Good. Okay, let's get back.

21:47.310 --> 21:50.311
Legacy is not something that
I can be concerned with.

21:50.314 --> 21:52.681
I'm laser-focused

21:52.682 --> 21:55.549
on doing the best possible job I can...

21:55.551 --> 21:58.986
...as president... Catherine.

21:58.988 --> 22:01.489
Not everybody gets to
just walk into the Oval.

22:03.090 --> 22:04.590
Madam President.

22:04.593 --> 22:06.759
- Wayne! Hey!
- Hey.

22:06.761 --> 22:09.797
What the what? What, are
you doing an interview?

22:09.798 --> 22:11.365
Yeah, he is.

22:11.366 --> 22:14.099
- Well, completely slipped my mind.
- Okay.

22:14.102 --> 22:16.169
Ma'am, here are the talking
points for this afternoon.

22:16.171 --> 22:18.070
Oh, no. Sorry.

22:18.073 --> 22:19.939
Wrong ones. I'll be back.

22:19.941 --> 22:23.875
- See you at poker on Wednesday.
-<i> Right.</i>

22:23.877 --> 22:26.412
So you see what I'm dealing with here.

22:26.413 --> 22:29.715
So you didn't tell him that
I'm taking his job yet?

22:29.718 --> 22:31.851
No, that'll be your first press release.

22:31.853 --> 22:33.819
Now that there will be
three babies on the way,

22:33.822 --> 22:36.255
we decided to move the kiddos
upstairs to the master

22:36.257 --> 22:39.289
and this will be the new love palace.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.925
She gets the dresser and I'll hang those

22:41.927 --> 22:43.961
in the... I don't know where.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.631
The lead, still a problem.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.799
<i>Raise your right hand, please.</i>

22:48.801 --> 22:51.737
<i>- I do solemnly swear...</i>
- I do solemnly swear...

22:51.739 --> 22:54.739
<i>...that I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States...</i>

22:54.740 --> 22:58.375
...that I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States...

23:00.613 --> 23:02.346
Vermont abstains from the vote.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.314
Oh, God.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.983
<i>That's three abstentions.
Sorry, ma'am.</i>

23:08.319 --> 23:09.987
What?

23:09.989 --> 23:12.255
Wait, though, isn't there
anything that we can do?

23:12.257 --> 23:14.323
No, you'd have to run
the table now to win.

23:14.325 --> 23:15.991
There's no way you can get to 26.

23:15.993 --> 23:17.861
- But what if we get Virginia?
- You're not gonna get Virginia.

23:17.863 --> 23:19.828
- What if we get West Virginia?
- You're not gonna get anything.

23:19.830 --> 23:21.897
Can we give them farm subsidies?

23:21.900 --> 23:22.659
Can we...

23:22.683 --> 23:24.933
You can't win, ma'am. You're
not gonna be president.

23:24.935 --> 23:28.202
<i>- Virginia votes for Bill O'Brien.</i>
- Ma'am?

23:28.204 --> 23:29.971
<i>Virginia votes
for Bill O'Brien.</i>

23:29.972 --> 23:32.840
- Oh, Christ. O'Brien's only got 22.
- Yeah.

23:32.843 --> 23:35.943
I mean, I don't think
even he can get to 26.

23:35.945 --> 23:39.448
Looks like we're looking down the
barrel of a Tom James presidency.

23:39.450 --> 23:42.349
Could you explain to me one more
time how this whole thing works?

23:42.352 --> 23:44.251
<i>Why is Tom...</i>

23:44.253 --> 23:46.453
<i>I'm really sorry, Mom.</i>

23:46.455 --> 23:48.021
Hey, don't worry, ma'am.

23:48.023 --> 23:50.924
You can run again in
four years, you know?

23:50.926 --> 23:53.528
Not if Tom James is president, I can't.

23:53.529 --> 23:57.330
<i>...Washington votes
for Bill O'Brien.</i>

23:57.333 --> 23:59.767
<i>Washington
votes for Bill O'Brien.</i>

24:01.369 --> 24:04.471
- All right, everybody clear out.
- Okay.

24:04.472 --> 24:06.873
- Clear out!
<i>- Let's go.</i>

24:06.875 --> 24:08.909
<i>Except you, Amy.</i>

24:08.911 --> 24:12.612
Oh, God, come on, come on.

24:12.614 --> 24:15.781
Okay, look.

24:15.784 --> 24:18.317
Get that clowntard Jonah
on the phone right now.

24:18.319 --> 24:22.054
What if we tell him to vote for O'Brien?

24:23.891 --> 24:26.558
Ma'am, you can't do that.
He is the opposition...

24:26.560 --> 24:30.496
It is the only fucking
thing that I can do, Amy.

24:30.498 --> 24:32.263
Seriously.

24:32.266 --> 24:36.133
If O'Brien wins the presidency, I
can run against him in four years.

24:36.134 --> 24:38.035
But if Tom James wins,

24:38.037 --> 24:42.239
he's gonna be president for the
next eight years, Amy. Eight!

24:42.240 --> 24:44.174
- 12, ma'am.
- Huh?

24:44.176 --> 24:46.109
Tom's first term won't count

24:46.112 --> 24:48.378
because technically he'll be
an elevated vice president.

24:48.381 --> 24:50.013
But I sound like Kent, so...

24:50.016 --> 24:51.950
My God, in 12 years,

24:51.951 --> 24:55.184
I'm gonna be a shriveled-up can of ass.

24:55.186 --> 24:57.921
Seriously, I can't... I
mean, my political window

24:57.923 --> 25:01.191
just slams shut the second I
can't wear sleeveless dresses.

25:01.192 --> 25:06.028
Call Jonah right now and tell
him to vote for O'Brien.

25:07.799 --> 25:09.798
Oh, excuse me. Where
is the House Chamber?

25:09.800 --> 25:11.634
The House Chamber is that way.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.434
No, it's not. We just...

25:13.436 --> 25:15.637
we just fucking came from there!

25:15.640 --> 25:17.874
No, it's not...

25:17.875 --> 25:19.407
God damn it.

25:21.045 --> 25:23.412
You better be right.

25:23.413 --> 25:25.047
They're gonna close the vote.

25:25.048 --> 25:26.780
- O'Brien 25.
- He's one away.

25:26.782 --> 25:28.549
Please, God, deliver Jonah to Congress

25:28.551 --> 25:30.751
and then give him any kind of cancer.
I don't care.

25:30.753 --> 25:32.820
- There he is.
- Catherine.

25:32.823 --> 25:36.023
-<i> Marjorie? I don't want to talk to you.</i>
- I'm sorry, okay?

25:36.026 --> 25:38.125
I told my parents about us.

25:38.127 --> 25:39.927
- New Hampshire...
- They took it hard, but I don't care.

25:39.930 --> 25:41.796
- I love you.
- ...proudly casts its vote

25:41.798 --> 25:43.963
- for President Selina Meyer.
- <i>I love you, too.</i>

25:44.693 --> 25:46.700
New Hampshire
votes for Selina Meyer.

25:46.701 --> 25:49.236
<i>The vote is hereby closed.</i>

25:49.238 --> 25:53.373
That's O'Brien 25, Meyer 22.

25:53.375 --> 25:56.710
With three abstentions,
no candidate has received

25:56.711 --> 25:59.779
the constitutionally required 26 votes.

25:59.781 --> 26:01.681
<i>This House is adjourned.</i>

26:01.682 --> 26:03.849
I'm sorry, I would like
to change my vote.

26:03.852 --> 26:05.984
I voted for the wrong person.

26:05.987 --> 26:08.654
I would like to change
my vote, thank you.

26:08.656 --> 26:10.221
Where is everyone going?

26:10.223 --> 26:11.958
The gentleman from New Hampshire

26:11.960 --> 26:15.028
puts forth onto the floor
a do-over, thank you.

26:15.029 --> 26:17.762
We have just witnessed
a historic no decision

26:17.765 --> 26:19.463
in the House of Representatives.

26:19.465 --> 26:21.332
Okay, we got to
get a statement out.

26:21.334 --> 26:24.603
The Senate will now choose between
Senators Tom James and Laura Montez.

26:24.605 --> 26:26.672
- Oh, hey, Marjorie.
<i>- Hello, ma'am.</i>

26:26.673 --> 26:28.707
<i>If I lose, I lose.</i>

26:28.709 --> 26:31.843
<i>Teddy Roosevelt lost. John Adams lost.</i>

26:31.845 --> 26:33.144
<i>Winston Churchill lost.</i>

26:33.145 --> 26:35.278
<i>So plenty of presidents have lost</i>

26:35.280 --> 26:38.515
and gone on to do great, great things.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.686
Are we done, sweetie?

26:42.689 --> 26:46.123
- I can't fucking lose this thing.
- You won't. You won't.

26:50.395 --> 26:52.695
<i>We are now entering the Red Room,</i>

26:52.698 --> 26:54.864
which originally was
the yellow drawing...

26:54.865 --> 26:57.834
Madam President, I am so sorry.

26:57.836 --> 26:59.501
- We're just coming through.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

26:59.503 --> 27:02.171
Everybody come on in. Come on in.

27:02.173 --> 27:04.272
<i>Welcome, welcome.</i>

27:04.275 --> 27:06.041
Welcome. Hello.

27:06.044 --> 27:07.943
Look at you. I think you're from Kansas.

27:07.945 --> 27:10.412
- I can see it...
- I am. I voted for you twice.

27:10.413 --> 27:13.414
This year and back when you ran
for president the first time.

27:13.416 --> 27:16.050
Oh, you're clutching your bag
like I'm gonna steal it.

27:16.053 --> 27:17.853
- <i>Oh, no!</i>
- No.

27:17.855 --> 27:19.989
- Would you like to take a picture?
- Oh, yeah.

27:19.990 --> 27:22.523
Oh, yeah. She knows what she wants.

27:23.794 --> 27:25.126
- Did we get it?
- Yeah.

27:25.128 --> 27:26.794
Okay, great. Thank you.

27:26.796 --> 27:28.762
- I love you.
- Oh.

27:30.967 --> 27:33.067
Oh.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.502
Whoo!

27:35.505 --> 27:37.605
- Thank you.
- <i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

27:37.606 --> 27:39.339
<i>Yeah!</i>

27:39.342 --> 27:41.942
Thank you.

27:41.944 --> 27:44.044
- <i>Whoo-hoo!</i>
- Thank you.

27:44.046 --> 27:45.577
Thank you.

27:50.152 --> 27:53.219
Who else would like a photo?
Oh!

27:53.221 --> 27:56.957
<i>Some say a tie is
like kissing your sister.</i>

27:56.959 --> 27:59.058
<i>But it took an electoral college tie</i>

27:59.060 --> 28:03.261
<i>for me to get to kiss the
sister I never knew I had.</i>

28:07.634 --> 28:09.701
<i>I'm just gonna
ask you what you think</i>

28:09.703 --> 28:12.270
<i>of a few people in my
mother's administration.</i>

28:12.272 --> 28:14.039
It's a great opportunity. Thank you.

28:14.041 --> 28:15.775
<i>What do you think of Amy Brookheimer?</i>

28:15.777 --> 28:17.607
She likes to hear herself talk.

28:17.609 --> 28:19.144
- Tense.
- Shrill.

28:19.145 --> 28:20.344
- Shrill.
- Shrill.

28:20.346 --> 28:22.113
- Shrill.
- Did they say shrill?

28:22.115 --> 28:25.049
-<i> How would you describe Gary Walsh?</i>
- A kind person.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.751
- Truck stop glory hole.
- Can do a handstand still.

28:27.753 --> 28:29.921
-<i> What do you think of Dan Egan?</i>
- Douchebag.

28:29.923 --> 28:32.691
- The other side of the glory hole.
- He's fine.

28:32.692 --> 28:35.525
Mike is an idiot. It's amazing
he got a driver's license.

28:35.527 --> 28:38.929
One of the most extraordinarily incoherent
people I've ever met in my life.

28:38.931 --> 28:41.699
Sometimes, like, in a futuristic...
like a sci-fi movie,

28:41.701 --> 28:45.068
you'll see, like, a robot that's
like the old version of the robot

28:45.070 --> 28:47.171
- and you kind of feel bad.
- <i>How about Jonah?</i>

28:47.173 --> 28:50.507
Jonah Ryan is the congressman that
the people of New Hampshire deserve.

28:50.509 --> 28:53.843
<i>Do you think you had a crowning
achievement as vice president?</i>

28:53.845 --> 28:57.512
Well, I became president.

28:57.515 --> 29:01.017
- Can we call that an achievement?
-<i> Did you vote for Mom?</i>

29:01.019 --> 29:03.752
If I would have voted, it would have
certainly been for your mother.

29:03.755 --> 29:05.688
<i>Where do you see yourself in 20 years?</i>

29:05.690 --> 29:07.823
- White House.
- I'd say the Galapagos Islands.

29:07.825 --> 29:08.711
Just be president.

29:08.737 --> 29:11.125
I have it penciled in 2036.
Gonna go there.

29:11.127 --> 29:12.961
- Just the seat of power.
- I bought two tickets.

29:12.962 --> 29:14.695
I don't know who the other is gonna be,

29:14.698 --> 29:16.832
but I'm assuming by then
I'll be coupled up.

29:16.834 --> 29:19.000
