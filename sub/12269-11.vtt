WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.134
(Emily) MY FATHER
WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.134 --> 00:04.775
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:04.775 --> 00:06.777
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:06.777 --> 00:10.041
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
TO AVENGING HIS DEATH.

00:10.041 --> 00:11.512
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.015
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.448
(priest) I PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE.

00:17.448 --> 00:20.020
I SUSPECT YOU'RE
ABOUT AS PREGNANT AS I AM.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.222
THIS PHOTO PROVES THAT

00:21.222 --> 00:23.654
YOU'VE BEEN TARGETING MY FAMILY
AND MY SON FOR YEARS.

00:23.654 --> 00:25.056
GOOD-BYE, VICTORIA.

00:25.056 --> 00:26.257
(muffled scream)

00:26.257 --> 00:29.060
(lowered voice)
TWO MINUTES AND THEN FIRE.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.462
I HEARD EVERYTHING.
YOU SET ME UP.

00:31.462 --> 00:34.565
WHY DID YOU TELL ME
I WAS GONNA BE A FATHER?!
 I'M SORRY.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.571
OH, MY GOD. WHERE'S EMILY?

00:40.571 --> 00:42.213
SHE SHOULD'VE BEAT ME
TO THE BEACH TEN MINUTES AGO.

00:46.317 --> 00:49.180
(woman) EMILY THORNE
IS STILL MISSING AT SEA.

00:49.180 --> 00:51.822
(siren whoops)
 FORMER GOVERNOR GRAYSON
AND HIS IMMEDIATELY FAMILY

00:51.822 --> 00:53.254
ARE BEING QUESTIONED
BY AUTHORITIES

00:53.254 --> 00:55.686
AT THE HAMPTONS COAST GUARD
FACILITY.

00:55.686 --> 00:58.559
NOW FEW DETAILS ARE KNOWN
AT THIS POINT,

00:58.559 --> 01:00.731
BUT WHAT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IS

01:00.731 --> 01:03.094
SOCIALITE EMILY THORNE
HAS DISAPPEARED

01:03.094 --> 01:06.066
DURING HER HONEYMOON CRUISE
WITH PUBLISHER DANIEL GRAYSON.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.369
NOW A GRAYSON FAMILY
SPOKESPERSON SAYS

01:08.369 --> 01:10.741
ALL PARTIES ARE
COOPERATING FULLY

01:10.741 --> 01:12.072
WITH AUTHORITIES.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.075
AND SO FAR, THERE IS
NO WORD YET ON SUSPECTS

01:15.075 --> 01:16.147
OR A MOTIVE.

01:16.147 --> 01:17.308
(taps key)

01:17.308 --> 01:20.581
OH, MY GOD.
NOLAN, WHAT HAPPENED?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.553
I-I DON'T KNOW.

01:22.553 --> 01:23.814
I JUST FOUND OUT.

01:23.814 --> 01:25.416
OH, GOD.
NOLAN, I'M SO SORRY.

01:25.416 --> 01:27.418
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

01:27.418 --> 01:28.659
I DON'T KNOW.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.092
UH, I'M GONNA GO
FIND VICTORIA.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.266
I'LL CALL IF I GET
ANY--ANY INFORMATION.

01:35.266 --> 01:37.128
UH, KEEP IN TOUCH?

01:37.128 --> 01:39.570
YEAH, I WILL.

01:39.570 --> 01:40.831
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.813
HERE'S TO YOU, EMS,

01:52.813 --> 01:55.186
AND WELL-LAID PLANS.

01:57.388 --> 02:00.521
(bell clanging)

02:00.521 --> 02:03.454
(gasping)

02:03.454 --> 02:04.725
(grunts)

02:06.827 --> 02:08.529
(inhales deeply)

02:08.529 --> 02:10.701
(grunts)

02:12.763 --> 02:14.735
(groans)

02:19.810 --> 02:21.712
(grunts)

02:22.843 --> 02:24.915
(groans)

02:28.179 --> 02:29.720
(grunts)

02:32.152 --> 02:33.424
(beacon beeps)

02:34.925 --> 02:36.887
NO! UGH!

02:36.887 --> 02:40.461
(grunting)

02:40.461 --> 02:44.935
(bell continues clanging)

02:44.935 --> 02:47.938
(breathing heavily)

02:51.171 --> 02:53.444
(Aiden) I HAD EMILY'S SIGNAL
FOR A MOMENT. NOW IT'S GONE.

02:53.444 --> 02:54.605
(Jack) I THOUGHT YOU SAID

02:54.605 --> 02:55.776
YOU COULD TRACK HER ANYWHERE
ON THE PLANET?

02:55.776 --> 02:56.947
THE TRANSMITTER MAY HAVE
BEEN BROKEN IN THE FALL.

02:56.947 --> 02:58.309
I HAVE TO GO FIND HER.

02:58.309 --> 03:01.212
HOLD ON. THE CURRENTS COULD HAVE
TAKEN HER ANYWHERE.

03:01.212 --> 03:02.683
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.285
YOU SAW HER DRESS!
SHE WAS SHOT TWICE!

03:04.285 --> 03:05.456
AND SHE'LL NEED TO TREAT
HER WOUNDS,

03:05.456 --> 03:06.587
SO SHE'LL GO TO
THE CHANNEL MARKER,

03:06.587 --> 03:08.559
BECAUSE WE LEFT
AN EMERGENCY CASE THERE.

03:08.559 --> 03:10.321
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED.

03:10.321 --> 03:12.723
EMILY PLANS
FOR EVERY LAST DETAIL.

03:12.723 --> 03:14.194
I THOUGHT WE'D PREPARED
FOR ALL THE VARIABLES,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.195
BUT IT TURNS OUT
WE WERE LYING TO OURSELVES

03:15.195 --> 03:16.827
IN ORDER TO MEET
THAT DAMN DEADLINE OF HERS.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.399
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.801
NO. IT'S MINE.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.236
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:25.236 --> 03:26.977
I GAVE HER THAT DEADLINE.

03:26.977 --> 03:29.610
I TOLD HER THAT
IF SHE DIDN'T FINISH THIS,

03:29.610 --> 03:31.942
I WOULD EXPOSE
WHO SHE REALLY WAS.

03:31.942 --> 03:32.983
WHAT?

03:32.983 --> 03:35.446
(whispers) I JUST
WANTED HER TO STOP.

03:36.647 --> 03:39.290
(beeping)

03:39.290 --> 03:42.222
IT'S HER.
SHE'S GOT IT WORKING AGAIN.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.455
GO TO ROSS,
TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED.

03:44.455 --> 03:46.757
YOU WAIT FOR ME THERE.
I MAY NEED BOTH OF YOU.

03:46.757 --> 03:47.898
GO!

03:52.663 --> 03:55.306
I WAS GOVERNOR
OF THIS STATE,

03:55.306 --> 03:56.837
SO DON'T TELL ME
WHAT CAN'T BE DONE.

03:56.837 --> 04:00.371
I WANT MORE CHOPPERS
IN THE AIR, AND I WANT THEM NOW.

04:00.371 --> 04:01.542
OKAY.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.414
(helicopters whirring overhead)

04:03.414 --> 04:04.575
(sighs deeply)

04:04.575 --> 04:06.577
WE'RE GONNA FIND EMILY,
CHARLOTTE.

04:06.577 --> 04:09.520
I'M USING ALL THE RESOURCES
AT MY DISPOSAL.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.553
YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET IT.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.855
SOMEONE CLOSE TO US
SHOT EMILY.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.928
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
YOU WERE,

04:17.928 --> 04:20.861
AND DANIEL.

04:20.861 --> 04:21.992
BUT MOM?

04:25.966 --> 04:27.968
(indistinct conversations)

04:27.968 --> 04:30.901
JUST LET THE POLICE
DO THEIR JOBS.

04:30.901 --> 04:32.373
ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.945
(man) I HATE TO ASK,
MR. GRAYSON,

04:34.945 --> 04:37.408
BUT I NEED TO ESTABLISH
YOUR WHEREABOUTS

04:37.408 --> 04:39.510
AT THE TIME
OF THE SHOOTING.

04:39.510 --> 04:40.911
HE WAS WITH HIS FAMILY.

04:40.911 --> 04:44.655
WE WERE WATCHING A WEDDING VIDEO
IN THE MAIN CABIN.

04:44.655 --> 04:45.986
I-I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED

04:45.986 --> 04:49.490
IF YOU COULD OFFER
THIS YOUNG MAN A MOMENT ALONE.

04:49.490 --> 04:54.595
(indistinct conversations,
emergency radio chatter)

04:54.595 --> 04:56.427
WE'RE GONNA FIND HER, SON.

04:58.629 --> 05:00.931
MY PHOTOGRAPHER AND I WERE
COVERING THE HONEYMOON

05:00.931 --> 05:02.403
FOR "VOULEZ."

05:02.403 --> 05:04.875
WE WERE IN THE MAIN ROOM
WITH THE FAMILY

05:04.875 --> 05:06.837
WHEN THE CAPTAIN SOUNDED
THE ALARM.

05:06.837 --> 05:09.039
AND WHO WAS WITH YOU
AT THAT TIME?

05:09.039 --> 05:12.012
I DON'T KNOW. THERE WAS
SO MUCH CONFUSION.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.314
UH, BUT PERHAPS THESE
MIGHT HELP.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.846
THEY'RE PHOTOS OF THE EVENT.

05:15.846 --> 05:18.419
HUNDREDS OF THEM.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.990
AM I FREE TO GO NOW?

05:19.990 --> 05:21.452
YES, MS. LeMARCHAL.

05:21.452 --> 05:24.024
UH, BUT PLEASE DON'T SPEAK OF
THIS INVESTIGATION WITH ANYONE.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.726
NO, NO. OF COURSE.

05:29.099 --> 05:30.601
(woman)
AND WHY WEREN'T YOU LISTED

05:30.601 --> 05:32.533
ON THE OFFICIAL MANIFEST,
MS. DAVIS?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.004
I WAS A LATE ADDITION.

05:34.004 --> 05:36.006
CONRAD.

05:36.006 --> 05:37.908
CAN YOU TELL
THIS OVERBLOWN HALL MONITOR

05:37.908 --> 05:40.871
THAT I WAS SITTING WITH YOU
WHEN EMILY WAS SHOT?

05:40.871 --> 05:42.913
I CAN CONFIRM HER STATEMENT.

05:42.913 --> 05:45.946
BUT THANKS FOR YOUR DILIGENCE,
OFFICER.

05:45.946 --> 05:49.580
(men speaking indistinctly)

05:49.580 --> 05:50.851
(sighs)

05:50.851 --> 05:53.454
I HAD HOPED THAT
LYING TO THE AUTHORITIES

05:53.454 --> 05:56.787
WAS NOT GONNA BE A COMPONENT
OF THIS RELATIONSHIP.

05:56.787 --> 05:59.830
DO YOU MIND SHARING
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY WERE?

05:59.830 --> 06:02.433
I DIDN'T DO THIS, CONRAD.
HONESTLY.

06:02.433 --> 06:05.035
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU
IN OUR CABIN.

06:05.035 --> 06:06.567
BUT SINCE NO ONE CAN
CONFIRM THAT,

06:06.567 --> 06:08.799
I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK
TELLING THAT TO THE POLICE.

06:08.799 --> 06:12.703
WE FINALLY HAVE A SECOND CHANCE
AT A LIFE TOGETHER.

06:12.703 --> 06:15.646
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
GETTING IN THE WAY OF THAT.

06:15.646 --> 06:17.808
NEITHER DO I.

06:17.808 --> 06:20.581
WE FOUND SHELL CASINGS
ON THE DECK, MRS. GRAYSON.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.814
THAT MEANS SOMEBODY ONBOARD SHOT
YOUR DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.

06:23.814 --> 06:25.015
AND YET, I CAN'T SEEM
TO GET YOU TO TELL ME

06:25.015 --> 06:27.157
EXACTLY WHERE YOU WERE
WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED.

06:27.157 --> 06:29.159
I DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR TONE,
DETECTIVE.

06:29.159 --> 06:30.861
WELL, I'M SORRY,
MRS. GRAYSON.

06:30.861 --> 06:33.994
BUT WHEN A WITNESS REFUSES TO
COOPERATE, MY ANTENNA GOES UP.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.066
I AM NOT THE SHOOTER.

06:36.066 --> 06:38.599
LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT
AND MOVE ON.
 ALL RIGHT.

06:38.599 --> 06:41.602
LET'S DISCUSS THE PUBLIC FEUDS
YOU'VE HAD WITH THE VICTIM.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.605
NOT WITHOUT MY LAWYER.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.507
(motor whirring in distance)

06:50.110 --> 06:53.784
(labored breathing)

06:53.784 --> 06:55.045
(grunts)

06:55.045 --> 06:56.987
(whirring continues)

06:56.987 --> 06:58.789
(turns off motor)

07:00.020 --> 07:03.994
(ragged breathing)

07:14.505 --> 07:16.166
(grunts, inhales sharply)

07:16.166 --> 07:18.138
WE NEED TO GET YOU
TO A HOSPITAL.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.670
(whispering)
DON'T TAKE ME BACK.

07:19.670 --> 07:20.911
(shivers)

07:20.911 --> 07:22.613
LET'S JUST GO.

07:22.613 --> 07:23.874
(sniffles)

07:23.874 --> 07:25.676
(grunts) LIKE WE WANTED TO.

07:25.676 --> 07:29.049
IF I DON'T GET YOU HELP, YOU'RE
GOING TO DIE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:29.049 --> 07:31.652
(grunts) I JUST WANT...

07:31.652 --> 07:33.123
(exhales sharply)
I WANNA BE WITH YOU.

07:33.123 --> 07:35.055
(whispers) OKAY. OKAY.

07:35.055 --> 07:38.128
EMILY. EM.

07:38.128 --> 07:41.492
EMILY, YOU STAY WITH ME.
 (groans and shudders)

07:41.492 --> 07:43.494
EMILY?

07:53.043 --> 07:54.004
(loud crash)

07:54.004 --> 07:56.677
HMM? (grunts)

08:00.851 --> 08:02.012
(click)

08:06.817 --> 08:08.058
OH, GOD.

08:11.161 --> 08:13.163
(man) MAYDAY! MAYDAY! MAYDAY!

08:26.106 --> 08:27.578
EVERYTHING FELL APART.

08:27.578 --> 08:29.980
AIDEN SAID THAT VICTORIA EVEN
KNEW ABOUT THE FAKE PREGNANCY.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.812
SO VICTORIA SHOT HER?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.283
SHE COULDN'T HAVE.

08:33.283 --> 08:35.586
HE DRUGGED HER AND BROUGHT HER
BELOW DECK.

08:35.586 --> 08:38.288
WELL, THEN WHO DID THIS?

08:38.288 --> 08:41.121
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.
EMILY'S ALIVE.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.993
SHE'S AT SUFFOLK MEMORIAL.

08:42.993 --> 08:44.254
I FOUND HER ON A BOAT.
SHE WAS IN SHOCK.

08:44.254 --> 08:45.726
SO I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TIME,

08:45.726 --> 08:46.957
BUT I MADE SURE THAT
THE CAPTAIN DISCOVERED HER.

08:46.957 --> 08:47.998
YOU DIDN'T BRING HER IN?

08:47.998 --> 08:49.600
I COULDN'T TAKE THE RISK.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.701
OUR CONNECTION WOULD'VE
BEEN REVEALED,

08:50.701 --> 08:51.802
AND EMILY
WOULD'VE BEEN EXPOSED.

08:51.802 --> 08:53.033
YOU CAN'T TOY WITH HER LIFE
LIKE THAT.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.765
YOUR PLAN IS OVER.
LET IT GO!

08:54.765 --> 08:57.568
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU
 TO LECTURE ME?!

08:57.568 --> 08:58.839
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO DROVE HER TO THIS.

08:58.839 --> 09:03.043
SO WHY DON'T WE FOCUS
ON HOW WE CAN HELP HER?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.275
BECAUSE IF SHE SURVIVES,

09:05.275 --> 09:08.218
SHE IS STILL IN DANGER,
MAYBE NOW SO MORE THAN EVER.

09:08.218 --> 09:10.781
HE'S RIGHT.

09:10.781 --> 09:13.223
ONCE THE GRAYSONS FIND OUT SHE'S
ALIVE, THEY'LL--THEY'LL PANIC.

09:13.223 --> 09:15.786
THEY'LL SPIN SOME COVER STORY
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

09:15.786 --> 09:16.957
OR THEY'LL FINISH THE JOB.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.559
NOT ON MY WATCH.
I'M GONNA GET SOME ANSWERS.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.731
HOW YOU GONNA GET PAST
THE GRAYSONS?

09:20.731 --> 09:23.033
THEY'LL TURN THAT HOSPITAL
INTO A FORTRESS.

09:23.033 --> 09:25.736
THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT I PAID FOR HALF OF IT.

09:26.997 --> 09:29.099
YOU WANNA HELP EMILY?

09:29.099 --> 09:31.071
GO TALK TO
THAT GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.302
SHE WAS THERE.

09:32.302 --> 09:34.975
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

09:40.951 --> 09:42.212
MOM?

09:42.212 --> 09:44.054
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET TO YOU
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

09:44.054 --> 09:46.286
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?
 (whispers) OH, MY GOD.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.062
I'VE BECOME AN OFFICIAL
PERSON OF INTEREST.

09:52.062 --> 09:54.124
AND JUDGING BY THE LOOK
ON MY ATTORNEY'S FACE,

09:54.124 --> 09:56.126
I HAVE EVERY REASON
TO BE CONCERNED.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.029
IS THERE...

09:59.029 --> 10:00.801
SOMETHING YOU WANNA TELL ME?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.002
IF THERE IS, YOU KNOW,
I CAN HANDLE IT.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.705
NO, I DIDN'T DO IT, PATRICK.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.207
BUT AFTER LEARNING THE TRUTH
ABOUT EMILY, OH, I WANTED TO.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.839
WHAT TRUTH?

10:08.839 --> 10:11.181
SHE HAS BEEN TARGETING MY FAMILY
FOR YEARS.

10:11.181 --> 10:14.985
SHE EVEN FAKED HER PREGNANCY
TO TRAP DANIEL INTO MARRIAGE.

10:14.985 --> 10:17.648
I CONFRONTED HER.
SHE ADMITTED IT.

10:17.648 --> 10:19.089
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THE LOOK ON HER FACE,

10:19.089 --> 10:21.051
AS IF SHE WERE TAUNTING ME.

10:21.051 --> 10:22.352
WHY WOULD SHE COME AFTER YOU
LIKE THAT?

10:22.352 --> 10:23.954
I HAVE NO IDEA.

10:23.954 --> 10:25.125
IT'S LIKE AN OBSESSION.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.196
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT YOU
LAST NIGHT.

10:26.196 --> 10:27.928
DO NOT PUNISH YOURSELF.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.030
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I CAN TRULY TRUST.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.101
(whispers) AND I NEED YOU NOW
MORE THAN EVER.

10:31.101 --> 10:32.933
WELL, THEN COME HERE.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.265
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

10:35.265 --> 10:36.867
WE'RE GONNA PROVE
THAT YOU'RE INNOCENT.

10:36.867 --> 10:38.068
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

10:38.068 --> 10:39.239
I'M IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.742
I WAS WITH EMILY
JUST BEFORE SHE WAS SHOT.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.014
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
 I DON'T KNOW. I, UH...

10:44.014 --> 10:46.416
(inhales deeply) I...

10:46.416 --> 10:49.920
BLACKED OUT.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.051
AND THEN I WOKE UP
IN THE STATEROOM.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.083
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW I GOT THERE.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.725
YOU GOTTA
TELL THE POLICE THAT.

10:54.725 --> 10:56.086
A STORY THAT SOUNDS LIKE
DELUSIONAL RAVINGS

10:56.086 --> 10:58.358
OF A WOMAN WHO'S TRYING TO PROVE
SHE'S INNOCENT?

10:58.358 --> 11:01.061
NO, PATRICK.

11:01.061 --> 11:04.334
MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT
THIS NEVER SURFACES.

11:08.098 --> 11:10.240
DANIEL, I NEED YOU TO FOCUS.

11:12.042 --> 11:13.143
SORRY.

11:13.143 --> 11:15.375
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.108
CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT
HER PROBLEMS WITH EMILY?

11:18.108 --> 11:20.711
WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

11:20.711 --> 11:23.884
WELL, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY
THEY DON'T... GET ALONG.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.286
MY MOTHER DIDN'T SHOOT HER.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.288
LYDIA DAVIS CLAIMS

11:28.288 --> 11:31.121
VICTORIA WAS UPSET WITH EMILY
RIGHT BEFORE THE ATTACK.

11:31.121 --> 11:32.863
SOMETHING ABOUT A PHOTOGRAPH?

11:32.863 --> 11:35.165
LYDIA DAVIS IS ONE STEP ABOVE
A CALL GIRL.

11:35.165 --> 11:36.466
HER WORD MEANS NOTHING.

11:36.466 --> 11:38.829
WELL, IF I ONLY TOOK THE WORD
OF RESPECTABLE PEOPLE,

11:38.829 --> 11:41.171
I'D NEVER SOLVE A CASE.
 (door opens)

11:41.171 --> 11:44.134
(man) DETECTIVE,
YOU HAVE A SECOND?

11:48.178 --> 11:50.981
VESSEL... (speaks indistinctly)
WITH THE COAST GUARD.

11:50.981 --> 11:52.142
THANKS.

11:56.947 --> 11:59.149
THEY FOUND YOUR WIFE.

11:59.149 --> 12:01.852
(whispers) IS SHE, UH...
 YES.

12:01.852 --> 12:03.053
SHE'S ALIVE.

12:03.053 --> 12:05.025
(gasps)

12:06.296 --> 12:08.028
(woman)
EMILY'S A VERY LUCKY WOMAN.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.860
SHE SUFFERED
MASSIVE BLOOD LOSS

12:09.860 --> 12:11.501
FROM THE GUNSHOTS TO
THE ABDOMEN,

12:11.501 --> 12:13.003
AND SHE SUSTAINED
A CRANIAL INJURY

12:13.003 --> 12:15.065
FROM THE IMPACT
OF THE WATER.

12:15.065 --> 12:16.967
THERE'S BEEN SOME BLEEDING
ON THE PARIETAL LOBE,

12:16.967 --> 12:19.109
WHICH WE'LL MONITOR,
BUT SHE'LL PULL THROUGH.

12:19.109 --> 12:20.941
WHAT ABOUT THE BABY?

12:20.941 --> 12:24.775
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST IF
I TALK WITH MR. GRAYSON ALONE.

12:24.775 --> 12:27.417
COME ON, CHARLOTTE.

12:27.417 --> 12:30.120
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

12:30.120 --> 12:31.351
MRS. GRAYSON,

12:31.351 --> 12:33.253
I'M AFRAID THE POLICE
HAVE INSISTED

12:33.253 --> 12:35.485
THAT YOU NOT BE ALLOWED ACCESS
TO THE PATIENT.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.089
DANIEL, WE'LL BE AT THE HOUSE
IF YOU NEED US.

12:48.338 --> 12:51.371
DANIEL, I'M AFRAID I HAVE
TROUBLING NEWS.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.244
BLOOD TESTS SHOW
YOUR WIFE WAS...

12:54.244 --> 12:57.848
NEVER PREGNANT.

12:57.848 --> 13:00.010
(whispers) UM...

13:00.010 --> 13:02.212
I'D LIKE TO
KEEP THIS PRIVATE.

13:02.212 --> 13:04.114
MM.
 OKAY?

13:12.062 --> 13:14.294
MR. ROSS, YOU MAY AS WELL
TURN AROUND RIGHT NOW.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.465
THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER.

13:15.465 --> 13:16.997
EMILY IS MY FAMILY,

13:16.997 --> 13:19.469
AND I'M GONNA MAKE DAMN SURE
THAT YOURS DOESN'T HARM HER.

13:19.469 --> 13:21.001
HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME
THAT WAY,

13:21.001 --> 13:22.102
AFTER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.504
WHAT HAS DANIEL EVER DONE
TO YOU?

13:24.504 --> 13:27.107
DO YOU GET OFF CAUSING
INNOCENT PEOPLE PAIN?

13:27.107 --> 13:30.140
I WILL LET YOU KNOW
IF I MEET ANYONE INNOCENT.

13:30.140 --> 13:33.283
SO IN THE MEANTIME,
I'M GONNA GO SEE EMILY.

13:33.283 --> 13:35.415
YOU HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.587
WITHOUT
A FAMILY REPRESENTATIVE,

13:37.587 --> 13:39.920
YOU MAY NOT GO BEYOND
THOSE DOORS,

13:39.920 --> 13:42.993
NO MATTER HOW MANY WINGS
YOU'VE NAMED AFTER YOURSELF.

13:42.993 --> 13:44.454
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

13:44.454 --> 13:46.957
WELL, LET'S...

13:46.957 --> 13:50.430
SEE WHAT YOUR SON HAS TO SAY
ABOUT THAT.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.367
(lowered voice) LOOK, NOLAN,
IT'S BEST IF YOU JUST GO.

13:57.367 --> 13:58.909
I THOUGHT THAT WE SAID

13:58.909 --> 14:01.071
THAT WE WEREN'T GONNA LET
THE WOMEN IN OUR LIVES

14:01.071 --> 14:03.173
GET IN THE WAY OF WHAT WE HAVE?

14:03.173 --> 14:06.046
SO JUST HELP ME. PLEASE.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.118
(voice breaks) YOU DIDN'T GO
TO THE CITY LAST NIGHT.

14:08.118 --> 14:09.249
YOU WERE WITH HIM.

14:09.249 --> 14:12.953
(crying) I TOLD YOU THESE PEOPLE
COULDN'T BE TRUSTED.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.956
(inhales deeply) HOW COULD YOU?!
OH, HOW COULD YOU?

14:15.956 --> 14:18.058
MOM.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.431
GET OUT OF HERE.

14:23.093 --> 14:24.164
GO.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.865
(scoffs)

14:27.497 --> 14:31.071
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

14:31.071 --> 14:35.075
(telephone rings in distance)

14:35.075 --> 14:37.908
(ring)

14:37.908 --> 14:40.911
(monitor beeping steadily)

15:00.971 --> 15:02.532
(Emily inhales sharply)

15:04.204 --> 15:06.076
(groans)

15:06.076 --> 15:10.010
(exhales sharply, sniffs)

15:10.010 --> 15:11.441
(weakly) WHERE...

15:11.441 --> 15:14.144
(breathes deeply)

15:14.144 --> 15:15.145
WHERE AM I?

15:15.145 --> 15:17.948
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.

15:17.948 --> 15:19.919
WHY?

15:21.191 --> 15:22.152
(inhales sharply)

15:22.152 --> 15:25.455
(inhales deeply,
exhales sharply)

15:25.455 --> 15:27.257
(whispers) WHAT HAPPENED?

15:27.257 --> 15:29.299
YOU DON'T KNOW?

15:29.299 --> 15:32.102
(monitor continues
beeping steadily)

15:32.102 --> 15:36.036
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?

15:36.036 --> 15:38.338
(voice breaks) NOTHING.
(inhales sharply)

15:38.338 --> 15:41.141
I DON'T REMEMBER...
(crying) ANYTHING.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.113
(sniffles)

15:43.113 --> 15:45.515
MM.

15:45.515 --> 15:47.177
PLEASE, TELL ME...

15:49.249 --> 15:50.420
(whispers) WHO AM I?

15:52.182 --> 15:55.185
(groans and cries)

15:59.229 --> 16:00.560
I SHOULD'VE COME WITH YOU.
 YEAH, BELIEVE ME,

16:00.560 --> 16:01.691
THERE WAS NO GETTING PAST
EITHER OF THEM.
 (typing)

16:01.691 --> 16:04.034
I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL
THE EJECTOR SEAT.

16:04.034 --> 16:07.097
NOW WE HAVE NO WAY IN.

16:07.097 --> 16:09.099
DO REALLY THINK THAT
I DIDN'T HAVE A BACKUP PLAN?

16:09.099 --> 16:11.101
(scoffs)
 (continues typing)

16:11.101 --> 16:14.244
WELCOME TO SUFFOLK MEMORIAL'S
INTERNAL SERVER.
 (beep)

16:14.244 --> 16:17.477
I LEFT A SMARTPHONE BEHIND
TO CREATE A MAKESHIFT HOT SPOT.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.480
NOW I HAVE ACCESS
TO THE PATIENT FILES.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.653
(resumes typing)
 WELL DONE. WHERE'S EMILY'S?

16:23.653 --> 16:26.156
SHE'S STABILIZED,

16:26.156 --> 16:29.419
BUT THOSE BULLETS REALLY DID
SOME INTERNAL DAMAGE.

16:29.419 --> 16:31.591
(taps button)

16:31.591 --> 16:32.622
OH, NO.

16:32.622 --> 16:35.495
"TRANSIENT GLOBAL AMNESIA"?

16:37.697 --> 16:41.431
AIDEN, THAT'S MAJOR
CEREBRAL TRAUMA.

16:41.431 --> 16:43.533
SHE'S SURROUNDED
BY THE ENEMY.

16:43.533 --> 16:46.276
SHE'S FAKING HER CONDITION
TO BUY HERSELF TIME.

16:47.677 --> 16:50.110
YEAH, IT DOES SOUND
LIKE MY EMS.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.541
SHE JUST GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY
TO MOVE HER OUT OF THERE.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.113
TO WHERE?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.285
I KNOW A SAFE HOUSE WHERE
SHE CAN GET MEDICAL ATTENTION

16:55.285 --> 16:56.616
AWAY FROM THE GRAYSONS.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.319
NOW CAN YOU ACCESS THE OTHER
HOSPITAL COMPUTER SYSTEMS?

16:59.319 --> 17:01.321
YOU GIVE ME ENOUGH TIME,

17:01.321 --> 17:05.155
AND I WILL MAKE THE TOILETS
FLUSH IN MORSE CODE.

17:05.155 --> 17:06.326
(flash drive clicks)

17:09.759 --> 17:12.602
(telephone rings in distance)

17:12.602 --> 17:14.304
MARGAUX.

17:14.304 --> 17:15.464
HEY.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.238
(exhales deeply)

17:18.238 --> 17:20.569
OH, AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU.

17:22.472 --> 17:23.813
I GOT YOUR MESSAGES.

17:25.675 --> 17:26.646
YOU OKAY?
 (exhales deeply)

17:26.646 --> 17:28.548
UH, YEAH. I'M FINE.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.280
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT EMILY.

17:33.523 --> 17:35.155
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?

17:35.155 --> 17:37.657
I WISH I KNEW. I SAW NOTHING.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.529
I WAS IN THE MAIN ROOM.

17:39.529 --> 17:41.631
AND ALL THE GRAYSONS CLAIM
TO HAVE BEEN THERE, TOO.

17:41.631 --> 17:43.463
SOMEONE'S LYING.

17:46.336 --> 17:48.538
ARE THESE...

17:48.538 --> 17:51.601
ARE THESE COPIES OF THE PICTURES
YOU GAVE TO THE POLICE?

17:51.601 --> 17:53.603
NO, I HID THESE FROM THEM.

17:53.603 --> 17:57.247
THEY'RE THE ONES TAKEN
AT THE TIME EMILY WAS SHOT.

17:57.247 --> 18:00.210
AFTER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
CONRAD, I COULDN'T RISK IT.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.652
IT'S A GOOD MOVE.

18:04.654 --> 18:07.717
WELL, IF CONRAD IS GUILTY,

18:07.717 --> 18:10.220
HE'S DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB
OF HIDING IT.

18:10.220 --> 18:13.263
LOOK. HE'S IN PHOTO AFTER PHOTO
AT THE TIME OF THE SHOOTING.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.595
THIS MEANS HE HAD SOMEONE ELSE
PULL THE TRIGGER.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.567
OR MAYBE HE DIDN'T DO IT.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.869
THE PRESS THINK IT'S VICTORIA.

18:19.869 --> 18:23.233
SHE TRULY HATES EMILY.

18:23.233 --> 18:26.105
AND SHE'S NOT IN ANY
OF THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS.

18:28.178 --> 18:30.740
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE MISSING
FROM THESE PICTURES.

18:37.887 --> 18:43.423
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

18:43.423 --> 18:45.325
YOU'VE SPENT MORE TIME
OUT IN THIS HALL

18:45.325 --> 18:47.727
THAN IN THERE WITH HER.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.630
WELL, SHE NEEDS HER REST.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.763
EVEN IF SHE WERE AWAKE,

18:53.763 --> 18:55.605
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D SAY.

18:55.605 --> 18:57.607
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP,
DANIEL.

18:57.607 --> 18:59.439
NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.442
(telephone rings in distance)

19:02.442 --> 19:03.813
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:03.813 --> 19:06.646
I CHECKED ON SARA.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.617
WH--

19:07.617 --> 19:09.349
SHE'S OKAY.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.580
(sighs deeply)

19:10.580 --> 19:13.483
AND DON'T WORRY.
EMILY WILL GET BETTER.

19:13.483 --> 19:15.255
SHE WILL PULL THROUGH.

19:15.255 --> 19:18.728
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

19:20.630 --> 19:22.692
I KNOW THE POLICE
TALKED TO YOU ABOUT MOM.

19:22.692 --> 19:24.834
THEY ASKED ME, TOO.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.599
WELL, SHE--SHE'S INNOCENT,
CHARLOTTE.

19:29.599 --> 19:32.502
I DON'T THINK SHE IS.

19:32.502 --> 19:33.673
NO ONE DOES.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.453
I NEVER KNEW HOW UNCOMFORTABLE
THIS CHAIR WAS.

19:43.453 --> 19:45.855
WHEN I SHOWED YOU
THAT PICTURE, VICTORIA,

19:45.855 --> 19:48.458
I SIMPLY WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THE TRUTH ABOUT EMILY.

19:49.759 --> 19:51.961
I NEVER EXPECTED FOR YOU TO
SHOOT HER.

19:51.961 --> 19:54.224
YOU'RE OUT OF
YOUR DEPTH, LYDIA.

19:54.224 --> 19:56.566
YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

19:56.566 --> 19:59.769
CROSS ME AGAIN, AND WATCH
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU.

19:59.769 --> 20:03.933
OOH. YOUR CONFIDENCE IS
WOEFULLY MISPLACED, VICTORIA.

20:03.933 --> 20:07.507
YOU LACK AN ALIBI TO
SUBSTANTIATE YOUR CLAIMS.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.579
AND HIDING FROM YOUR LAWYER

20:09.579 --> 20:12.742
INSTEAD OF OFFERING ANYTHING
PLAUSIBLE REEKS OF GUILT.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.614
(inhales deeply) HMM.

20:14.614 --> 20:18.648
I'M REALLY ENJOY REMODELING
GRAYSON MANOR.

20:18.648 --> 20:19.889
MM.

20:19.889 --> 20:23.593
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS ROOM
COULD USE A SPLASH OF COLOR.

20:28.698 --> 20:30.830
(wine glass shatters)

20:30.830 --> 20:32.902
(gasps)
 YOU LIKE THAT? HUH?

20:32.902 --> 20:34.264
NO?

20:34.264 --> 20:36.005
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

20:37.567 --> 20:38.968
WELL...

20:38.968 --> 20:42.241
YOU'RE CERTAINLY BEHAVING LIKE
SOMEONE INCAPABLE OF MURDER.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.413
BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD

20:43.413 --> 20:45.575
TO YOUR PERFORMANCE
ON THE STAND, MY DEAR.

20:45.575 --> 20:48.578
I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED
A GOOD FARCE.

20:48.578 --> 20:51.621
(sighs deeply)

20:51.621 --> 20:53.753
(brakes screech)

20:53.753 --> 20:55.555
(shifts gears)

20:55.555 --> 20:56.726
(turns off engine)

21:00.029 --> 21:01.791
ROSS, I'M HERE.

21:01.791 --> 21:03.032
I'M GOING IN.

21:03.032 --> 21:06.796
I JUST FINISHED LOOPING
THE SECURITY CAMERAS.

21:06.796 --> 21:11.371
YOU CAN NOW MOVE THROUGH
THE HOSPITAL UNDETECTED.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.542
THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I NEED YOU TO BRING WITH YOU

21:12.542 --> 21:13.673
TO THE SAFE HOUSE.

21:13.673 --> 21:14.874
ENGAGEMENT RING, PERHAPS?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.847
YEAH, FEW STEPS AHEAD OF YOU,
MATHIS.

21:17.847 --> 21:20.610
FIGURED YOU WANNA PUT
THAT LITTLE TRINKET

21:20.610 --> 21:22.312
BACK ON HER FINGER.

21:22.312 --> 21:24.354
I'LL STAND BY

21:24.354 --> 21:27.587
UNTIL YOU ARE IN POSITION
ON EMILY'S FLOOR.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.759
(whirring, remote clatters)

21:31.821 --> 21:33.623
WE NEED TO TALK.

21:36.366 --> 21:39.899
ACTUALLY, I DON'T THINK WE DO.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.901
SEE, I NEEDED
YOUR HELP TODAY.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.834
BUT INSTEAD, YOU DECIDED TO
CHECK BACK INTO THE BATES MOTEL.

21:44.834 --> 21:46.005
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, PATRICK?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.577
FRANKLY, I'M NOT INTO
MAMA'S BOYS.

21:47.577 --> 21:48.908
W-WELL, LET'S CONTINUE
TO TALK ABOUT YOU, NOLAN.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.741
YOU MANIPULATED ME, AND YOU DID
IT JUST TO GET WHAT YOU WANTED.

21:51.741 --> 21:54.344
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT
THAN EMILY.

21:54.344 --> 21:55.915
SO NOW YOU'RE GOING TO
ATTACK A WOMAN

21:55.915 --> 21:58.748
THAT IS FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE
IN A HOSPITAL BED?

21:58.748 --> 22:01.020
THAT'S CLASSY.
 OH, PLEASE!
LET'S STOP, ALL RIGHT?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.822
SHE'S NOT AS INNOCENT AS YOU
MAKE HER OUT TO BE, NOLAN!

22:02.822 --> 22:04.724
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
NEITHER ARE YOU.

22:04.724 --> 22:05.995
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?

22:05.995 --> 22:08.027
I SHOULD'VE BAILED
THE MINUTE I FOUND OUT

22:08.027 --> 22:09.959
YOU BRIBED MY EX-WIFE
TO GET DIRT ON ME.

22:09.959 --> 22:13.002
WELL, DON'T LET ME
STOP YOU NOW.

22:16.806 --> 22:19.809
(footsteps retreat)

22:21.741 --> 22:24.444
(door opens)

22:24.444 --> 22:26.075
(door closes)

22:26.075 --> 22:27.917
(sighs deeply)

22:33.052 --> 22:35.024
ALL RIGHT, MATHIS.

22:35.024 --> 22:36.386
LET'S DO THIS.

22:37.687 --> 22:39.559
(door closes in distance)

22:39.559 --> 22:40.730
I'M IN.

22:40.730 --> 22:41.861
(door closes)

22:43.733 --> 22:46.396
(keypad beeping)

22:46.396 --> 22:48.698
(door beeps and unlocks)

22:51.771 --> 22:53.102
(telephone rings in distance)

22:53.102 --> 22:58.077
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

23:02.682 --> 23:05.755
(monitor beeping steadily)
 SHH. SHH.

23:07.156 --> 23:09.519
THERE'S AN AMBULANCE WAITING
FOR US DOWNSTAIRS.

23:09.519 --> 23:10.820
I'VE ARRANGED
FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION

23:10.820 --> 23:12.161
TO MEET US
AT THE SAFE HOUSE.

23:12.161 --> 23:13.823
(gasps)
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

23:13.823 --> 23:15.124
WHO ARE YOU?

23:15.124 --> 23:17.667
(breathing unevenly)

23:17.667 --> 23:18.998
EMILY?
 (grunts)

23:18.998 --> 23:21.170
EMILY?
EM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:21.170 --> 23:22.171
HELP ME!
 (click)

23:22.171 --> 23:23.703
(alert chimes)
 SOMEBODY!

23:25.635 --> 23:27.637
(alert chiming)

23:27.637 --> 23:29.509
(breathing heavily)

23:29.509 --> 23:30.640
(whimpers)

23:30.640 --> 23:31.811
(chiming continues)
 THERE WAS A MAN.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.042
(breathing heavily)

23:33.042 --> 23:34.644
HE WANTED TO TAKE ME
OUT OF HERE.

23:34.644 --> 23:36.045
HE WENT OUT THE WINDOW.

23:36.045 --> 23:38.017
NO. IT'S OKAY.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.589
(groans)
 IT WAS JUST A NIGHTMARE.

23:39.589 --> 23:40.990
(continues
breathing heavily) NO.
 YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

23:40.990 --> 23:42.592
(chiming continues)

23:42.592 --> 23:44.594
YOU'RE OKAY.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.564
WHAT'S... WHAT'S WRONG?

23:54.564 --> 23:57.436
WE TRIED TO GET EMILY OUT.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.469
IT, UH... (exhales)

23:59.469 --> 24:00.570
IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

24:00.570 --> 24:03.012
SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.

24:03.012 --> 24:05.174
ALL I SAW IN HER EYES
WAS FEAR.

24:05.174 --> 24:06.646
IT'S BAD.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.018
THERE'S... BRAIN SWELLING.

24:09.018 --> 24:10.119
IT'S NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE,
BUT...

24:10.119 --> 24:12.552
(inhales deeply)

24:12.552 --> 24:13.923
I DID SOME RESEARCH,

24:13.923 --> 24:17.056
AND HER DIAGNOSIS IS
AS PSYCHOLOGICAL

24:17.056 --> 24:19.058
AS IT IS PHYSIOLOGICAL.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.531
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT
IT'S NOT JUST FROM HER INJURIES?

24:21.531 --> 24:23.132
HER MIND SHUT DOWN.

24:23.132 --> 24:27.637
IT'S A DEFENSE
TO DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA.

24:27.637 --> 24:29.168
EMILY NEEDS SOMEONE

24:29.168 --> 24:32.842
TO JUST MAKE AN EMOTIONAL
CONNECTION WITH HER,

24:32.842 --> 24:36.506
SO SHE FEELS SAFE TO BE...
WELL, EMS AGAIN.

24:36.506 --> 24:38.948
(sighs)
 ROSS, I WAS--I WAS WITH HER.
THAT DOESN'T WORK.

24:38.948 --> 24:41.480
YEAH, WELL,
YOU WENT IN GUNS HOT.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.684
EMILY WASN'T EXACTLY PRIMED
TO FIND HER HAPPY PLACE.

24:44.684 --> 24:47.587
GETTING PAST THE GRAYSONS
WON'T BE EASY.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.719
BUT, JACK...

24:49.719 --> 24:51.090
MAYBE YOU CAN
GO TALK TO CHARLOTTE.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.092
NO.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.994
(voice breaks)
I DID THIS TO HER.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.026
I PUSHED EMILY,
AND NOW SHE'S...

24:57.026 --> 24:59.228
(breathes deeply)
SHE'S LIKE THIS.

24:59.228 --> 25:02.071
SEEING ME MAY ONLY
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

25:02.071 --> 25:05.735
(sighs)

25:05.735 --> 25:07.577
THIS IS EVIDENCE
THAT MARGAUX FOUND.

25:07.577 --> 25:09.138
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD
HAVE A COPY.

25:09.138 --> 25:10.640
(envelope rustles)

25:10.640 --> 25:11.911
(whispers) TAKE CARE OF HER.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.946
JUST LET HIM GO.

25:21.791 --> 25:24.223
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU TWO?!

25:24.223 --> 25:26.055
EMILY NEEDS US!

25:26.055 --> 25:28.227
LOOK, FOR ALL WE KNOW,
SOMEONE IS BIDING THEIR TIME,

25:28.227 --> 25:30.059
WAITING TO FINISH THE JOB!

25:30.059 --> 25:31.230
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.833
WHAT IS OUR NEXT MOVE?

25:37.136 --> 25:40.039
THERE'S SOME THINGS
I NEED TO DO ALONE.

25:43.973 --> 25:45.244
MOM.

25:48.878 --> 25:51.651
DANIEL.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.823
OH, I'M SO GRATEFUL
YOU'RE HERE.

25:53.823 --> 25:55.655
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
THESE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME

25:55.655 --> 25:56.826
ARE UNTRUE?

25:56.826 --> 25:58.928
THEY SAY YOU'RE GONNA
BE ARRESTED.

25:58.928 --> 26:00.790
WELL, I'LL ENDURE.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.562
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.064
I KNOW.

26:06.796 --> 26:08.097
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

26:10.199 --> 26:13.673
YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT ABOUT EMILY
FROM THE START.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.047
I DID IT.

26:18.047 --> 26:19.208
(gasps)

26:19.208 --> 26:20.309
I SHOT HER.

26:22.351 --> 26:24.353
YOU OVERHEARD US
ON THE DECK.

26:24.353 --> 26:26.255
I JUST GOT A CALL
ABOUT SARA.

26:26.255 --> 26:28.718
SHE TRIED TO KILL HERSELF.

26:28.718 --> 26:30.259
I COULDN'T BREATHE.
I WENT OUTSIDE.

26:31.320 --> 26:34.664
THAT'S WHEN
I HEARD YOU BOTH.

26:34.664 --> 26:36.626
I DIDN'T GO UP THERE
TO HURT HER.

26:36.626 --> 26:38.027
I WAS JUST SO ANGRY.

26:38.027 --> 26:40.599
DANIEL, WHERE DID THE GUN
COME FROM?

26:40.599 --> 26:43.272
I I DON'T REMEMBER.
I WAS DRUNK.

26:43.272 --> 26:47.076
THE GUN WAS THERE.
I-I PICKED IT UP, AND--AND IT...

26:47.076 --> 26:48.237
NOW THEY'RE BLAMING YOU.

26:48.237 --> 26:50.239
AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD
OUR PROBLEMS,

26:50.239 --> 26:52.241
BUT I AM NOT GONNA LET YOU
GO DOWN FOR MY CRIME.

26:52.241 --> 26:56.215
DANIEL, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT EMILY SET YOU UP.

26:56.215 --> 26:59.749
FOR ALL WE KNOW, SHE PUT
THE GUN THERE. SHE IS A MONSTER.

26:59.749 --> 27:01.721
I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF

27:01.721 --> 27:03.152
FOR HER CRUELTY.
 NO, MOM.

27:03.152 --> 27:04.123
DANIEL, PLEASE.
 NO. NO.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.895
MY LIFE ISN'T
YOUR PROBLEM TO FIX.

27:05.895 --> 27:07.827
NOW I'M GETTING A LAWYER.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.660
AND TOMORROW, I'M TURNING MYSELF
IN, AND THIS WILL ALL BE OVER.

27:10.660 --> 27:11.861
(whispers indistinctly)
 NO.

27:17.166 --> 27:20.169
(indistinct conversations)

27:27.146 --> 27:29.278
VICTORIA.

27:29.278 --> 27:31.721
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU.

27:31.721 --> 27:33.122
COMING HERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS MEDIA FIRESTORM

27:33.122 --> 27:34.784
MAY NOT BE
THE SMARTEST THING TO DO,

27:34.784 --> 27:37.026
BUT... (inhales deeply)

27:37.026 --> 27:39.388
(exhales deeply)
I NEED AN ALLY.

27:39.388 --> 27:41.731
AND I COULDN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE

27:41.731 --> 27:43.963
THAT YOU'VE YET TO TAKE
A PUBLIC STANCE ON MY GUILT.

27:43.963 --> 27:47.436
I LIKE TO KNOW ALL THE DETAILS
OF A STORY BEFORE I TELL IT.

27:49.999 --> 27:52.371
JACK TOLD YOU WHAT CONRAD DID
TO HIS FAMILY?

27:54.073 --> 27:56.275
YES.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.807
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

27:57.807 --> 27:59.008
I DIDN'T.

27:59.008 --> 28:01.310
BUT JACK IS
A MAN OF PRINCIPLE,

28:01.310 --> 28:03.783
AND I WOULD THINK THAT HE WOULD
WANT YOU TO KNOW THE TRUTH,

28:03.783 --> 28:06.215
GIVEN YOUR LONG-STANDING HISTORY
WITH MY FAMILY.

28:06.215 --> 28:10.790
I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR
WHAT CONRAD IS CAPABLE OF.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.421
I THINK HE'S TRYING
TO FRAME ME.

28:12.421 --> 28:15.124
YOU WANT MORE THAN AN ALLY,
VICTORIA.

28:15.124 --> 28:18.127
YOU WANT AN OBJECTIVE PARTY
TO HELP PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE.

28:18.127 --> 28:19.869
AND EXPOSE CONRAD'S GUILT.

28:19.869 --> 28:21.330
YOU WERE THERE, MARGAUX,

28:21.330 --> 28:24.133
AND YET, YOU DON'T SEEM
TO BUY THE POLICE'S THEORY.

28:25.374 --> 28:27.236
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT SHARING?

28:40.990 --> 28:45.795
THESE ARE COPIES OF PHOTOS TAKEN
MOMENTS AFTER EMILY WAS SHOT.

28:45.795 --> 28:48.197
EACH GUEST CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN
IN THE MAIN ROOM.

28:58.007 --> 28:59.108
LYDIA.

28:59.108 --> 29:01.811
(chuckles)
SHE'S NOT HERE.

29:01.811 --> 29:04.173
WHICH MEANS SHE LIED
TO THE POLICE.

29:06.115 --> 29:07.917
(monitor beeping steadily)

29:07.917 --> 29:10.179
YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

29:10.179 --> 29:13.853
IT WAS A LIKE
A REAL-LIVE FAIRY TALE.

29:15.424 --> 29:17.256
YOU'VE GOTTA REMEMBER
SOMETHING.

29:18.828 --> 29:20.759
(whispering) I DON'T.

29:23.192 --> 29:26.095
I KNOW YOU WILL.
 (exhales deeply)

29:26.095 --> 29:29.268
YOU'RE MY INSPIRATION, EMILY.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.470
I'VE ALWAYS RELIED
ON YOUR STRENGTH

29:31.470 --> 29:34.173
TO GET ME THROUGH
TOUGH TIMES.

29:34.173 --> 29:37.146
I JUST WISH I KNEW
WHERE YOU GOT IT FROM.

29:42.251 --> 29:44.053
(exhales deeply)

29:45.454 --> 29:47.256
(sighs)

29:47.256 --> 29:48.787
MY FATHER.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.389
YOU REMEMBER HIM?

29:50.389 --> 29:52.822
YES.

29:52.822 --> 29:55.264
THAT'S GOOD, EMILY.

29:55.264 --> 29:56.996
WHAT'S HIS NAME? TELL ME.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.568
DAVID.

29:59.568 --> 30:01.470
HIS NAME IS DAVID CLARKE.

30:15.845 --> 30:18.848
THESE WERE TAKEN
IN THE YACHT'S MAIN CABIN

30:18.848 --> 30:20.019
MOMENTS AFTER THE SHOOTING.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.291
LYDIA'S NOWHERE TO BE SEEN,

30:22.291 --> 30:24.493
WHICH CONTRADICTS
HER OFFICIAL STATEMENT.

30:24.493 --> 30:26.555
(chuckles) OH.
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FRAME HER,

30:26.555 --> 30:30.029
I ASSURE YOU, YOUR PLAN IS
AS FOOLHARDY AS IT IS DESPERATE.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.431
OH, I WON'T BE
FRAMING LYDIA.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.333
YOU WILL.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.035
WELL, NOW YOU CAN ADD
"DELUSIONAL" TO THE LIST.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.037
WHY WOULD I CONSENT TO THAT?

30:38.037 --> 30:39.108
TO PROTECT DANIEL.

30:40.309 --> 30:41.610
HE SHOT EMILY.

30:41.610 --> 30:43.913
THAT'S ABSURD.
 (photos clatter)

30:43.913 --> 30:44.874
WHY WOULD HE?

30:44.874 --> 30:46.215
BECAUSE SHE IS
A SICK AND VENOMOUS LIAR

30:46.215 --> 30:48.077
WHO TOYED WITH HIS EMOTIONS.

30:48.077 --> 30:50.279
SHE BROKE HIM, CONRAD.

30:50.279 --> 30:51.981
AND WHEN HE FINALLY
LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT HER,

30:51.981 --> 30:52.952
HE LASHED OUT.

30:54.283 --> 30:55.985
(whispers) MY GOD.

30:57.226 --> 30:58.457
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.030
AS SERIOUS AS DANIEL'S DESIRE
TO PROTECT ME.

31:01.030 --> 31:03.392
HE WILL CONFESS
UNLESS WE ACT.

31:03.392 --> 31:05.864
AND WE CANNOT LET HIM
THROW HIS LIFE AWAY

31:05.864 --> 31:07.036
FOR THAT VICIOUS WOMAN.

31:07.036 --> 31:08.197
(whispers) AH.

31:08.197 --> 31:11.100
WHICH LEAVES US
ONE COURSE OF ACTION.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.601
LYDIA GOES.

31:17.006 --> 31:18.347
(sighs)

31:18.347 --> 31:21.250
IT'S A TERRIBLE FEELING,
BETRAYING SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

31:21.250 --> 31:24.984
I'M SO PLEASED
THAT YOU FINALLY GET

31:24.984 --> 31:26.986
TO EXPERIENCE
THE SENSATION YOURSELF.

31:28.958 --> 31:31.190
(ship horn blows,
sea birds call)

31:38.397 --> 31:39.568
(sighs deeply)

31:39.568 --> 31:41.300
HEY.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.033
I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE GETTING CARL BY NOW.

31:44.033 --> 31:46.505
SO DID I.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.407
BUT NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.440
THIS THING WITH EMILY
HAS REALLY...

31:51.440 --> 31:53.312
IT'S REALLY GOTTEN TO ME.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.114
YEAH. ME, TOO.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.385
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO HELP HER,

31:56.385 --> 31:58.317
BUT THE WEIRDEST THING
JUST HAPPENED.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.488
WHAT?

31:59.488 --> 32:01.650
EMILY SAID
SHE REMEMBERED HER FATHER.

32:01.650 --> 32:04.423
AND WHEN I ASKED WHAT HIS NAME
WAS, SHE SAID, "DAVID CLARKE."

32:08.257 --> 32:10.629
WELL, SHE--I MEAN,
SHE PROBABLY...

32:10.629 --> 32:13.162
SAW YOU AND THEN GOT MIXED UP,
YOU KNOW?

32:13.162 --> 32:14.333
MAYBE.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.066
SHE SEEMED SO SURE OF IT.

32:17.066 --> 32:18.607
IT FREAKED ME OUT.

32:18.607 --> 32:20.509
CHARLOTTE, UM,

32:20.509 --> 32:22.711
I THINK IT MIGHT HELP
IF I SEE EMILY.

32:22.711 --> 32:25.244
LOOK, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
CONFUSED.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.116
I THINK I CAN HELP HER REMEMBER
THAT SHE'S EMILY THORNE

32:27.116 --> 32:29.078
AND NOT...

32:29.078 --> 32:31.350
SOMEONE ELSE.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.331
THERE YOU ARE.

32:42.331 --> 32:44.963
WELL...

32:44.963 --> 32:48.497
I KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE.

32:48.497 --> 32:53.042
BUT I FEEL SAFE KNOWING THAT
WE'RE HANDLING IT TOGETHER.

33:03.012 --> 33:05.414
WHAT'S WRONG?

33:05.414 --> 33:07.756
WE'VE BEEN EXPOSED.

33:09.058 --> 33:14.023
I HAVE TO REVISE MY STATEMENT
TO THE POLICE.

33:14.023 --> 33:16.095
THEY'LL KNOW I WAS LYING.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.526
YEAH, WELL, LYDIA,
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

33:17.526 --> 33:18.697
I MEAN, I'M FACING

33:18.697 --> 33:20.569
AN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
CHARGE.

33:20.569 --> 33:23.502
CONRAD, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
MY LIFE.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.174
OUR LIFE.

33:25.174 --> 33:27.676
I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.110
I NEED YOUR HELP.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.112
WELL, AND I'M GONNA
BE THERE FOR YOU.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.114
OH, COME ON. WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT?

33:35.114 --> 33:38.016
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE INNOCENT, RIGHT?

33:38.016 --> 33:39.718
SO... (chuckles)

33:39.718 --> 33:43.752
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TRUST ME.

33:43.752 --> 33:46.155
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
TO DAVID CLARKE.

33:46.155 --> 33:49.698
OH, COME ON. THIS IS
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SITUATION.

33:49.698 --> 33:51.060
DON'T YOU THINK?

33:52.461 --> 33:54.633
I'M GONNA LOOK AFTER YOU.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.466
SO DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH.

33:57.466 --> 34:00.409
AND STAY HERE,

34:00.409 --> 34:02.171
SO...

34:02.171 --> 34:03.772
I KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.108
I'LL GET THAT FOR YOU.

34:39.108 --> 34:40.549
THANK YOU.

34:40.549 --> 34:42.380
MY PLEASURE.

34:43.712 --> 34:45.714
(town car departs)

34:47.856 --> 34:49.717
(cell phone beeps)

34:49.717 --> 34:51.790
(ring)

34:51.790 --> 34:52.721
(line connects)

34:52.721 --> 34:54.793
IT'S DONE.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.166
SHE'S GONE.

34:59.328 --> 35:00.669
(cell phone beeps)

35:07.576 --> 35:10.409
THAT'S
AN INTERESTING TATTOO.

35:10.409 --> 35:13.282
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

35:13.282 --> 35:14.483
I'M NOT SURE.

35:17.216 --> 35:22.521
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

35:22.521 --> 35:23.652
I SAW YOU EARLIER.

35:26.495 --> 35:27.826
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

35:30.128 --> 35:32.561
EXCUSE ME. COULD YOU GIVE US
SOME PRIVACY, PLEASE?

35:32.561 --> 35:34.563
SURE.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.607
EMILY,

35:38.607 --> 35:40.569
MEET JACK.

35:47.476 --> 35:49.478
(woman) A STATEWIDE SEARCH
IS ON FOR LYDIA DAVIS,

35:49.478 --> 35:50.819
NOW THE PRIME SUSPECT

35:50.819 --> 35:53.422
IN THE BRUTAL SHOOTING
OF EMILY GRAYSON.

35:53.422 --> 35:55.854
POLICE REPORT THE SOCIALITE
WAS LAST SEEN

35:55.854 --> 35:58.427
LEAVING AN EXCLUSIVE
EAST HAMPTONS INN

35:58.427 --> 35:59.928
EARLIER TODAY.

35:59.928 --> 36:02.191
(turns off TV)

36:02.191 --> 36:05.464
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE COST ME?

36:05.464 --> 36:08.697
DANIEL, I JUST ALLOWED MYSELF

36:08.697 --> 36:10.239
TO BELIEVE
THAT LIFE COULD BE

36:10.239 --> 36:12.301
SOMETHING OTHER THAN GRAY
AND COLD.

36:12.301 --> 36:15.504
AND I WAS FORCED TO SACRIFICE
ALL OF IT TO PROTECT YOU.

36:15.504 --> 36:17.246
WELL, I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO.

36:17.246 --> 36:19.248
I WAS HANDLING IT MYSELF.

36:19.248 --> 36:21.580
(scoffs and chuckles)
YOU WERE?

36:21.580 --> 36:24.182
WHAT, BY ADMITTING THAT
YOU SHOT YOUR WIFE?

36:24.182 --> 36:26.855
HOW VERY NOBLE FOR YOU.

36:26.855 --> 36:29.488
IT'S MORE THAN YOU WOULD'VE
EVER DONE.

36:29.488 --> 36:31.490
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR DAMN MIND?

36:31.490 --> 36:34.663
I JUST OFFERED YOU FREEDOM
AT MY EXPENSE,

36:34.663 --> 36:36.795
AND YOU MADE IT
WITH REPROBATION?

36:36.795 --> 36:39.568
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, FINE.

36:39.568 --> 36:40.699
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,

36:40.699 --> 36:42.571
THE NEXT TIME YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN NEED OF SALVATION,

36:42.571 --> 36:45.674
MAY I SUGGEST THAT YOU DROP
TO YOUR KNEES AND YOU PRAY?

36:45.674 --> 36:47.906
BECAUSE FROM HERE ON,
YOUR ONLY HOPE

36:47.906 --> 36:50.539
WILL BE DIVINE INTERVENTION
FROM THE HEAVENLY FATHER HIMSELF

36:50.539 --> 36:53.482
BECAUSE YOUR EARTHLY FATHER
IS FINISHED WITH YOU!

36:53.482 --> 36:54.713
YOU DON'T THINK
I'VE SACRIFICED?!

36:54.713 --> 36:58.387
ALL I HAVE EVER DONE
IS SACRIFICE FOR EVERYONE!

36:58.387 --> 37:00.789
AND I HAVE LOST THE ONE PERSON
WHO MEANT ANYTHING TO ME,

37:00.789 --> 37:03.252
WHO NEVER LIED TO ME,
WHO LOVED ME.

37:03.252 --> 37:05.454
SARA? WELL, THERE'S
NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTE.

37:05.454 --> 37:07.796
YOU SAY ONE MORE THING
ABOUT HER. I BEG OF YOU.

37:07.796 --> 37:08.927
OH, YOU WANNA
TAKE THIS OUT ON ME?

37:08.927 --> 37:10.729
YOU BETTER THINK AGAIN,
BECAUSE I AM THIS CLOSE

37:10.729 --> 37:12.561
TO SHOWING YOU WHAT
I'M TRULY CAPABLE OF.

37:12.561 --> 37:14.963
DO IT, 'CAUSE I'VE GOT
NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE.

37:31.780 --> 37:35.784
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
NIKO?

37:35.784 --> 37:37.526
(Australian accent) WELL,
WHEN I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED

37:37.526 --> 37:41.490
TO EMILY THORNE, THE NEWS DIDN'T
MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.732
SO I CAME TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY.

37:43.732 --> 37:46.965
WELL, I HAD TO GO RADIO SILENCE.
YOU KNEW THAT.

37:46.965 --> 37:50.469
AND WHY ARE YOU TREATING EMILY?
THAT'S TOO RISKY FOR YOU.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.341
I'M THE BEST DOCTOR YOU KNOW.

37:52.341 --> 37:55.844
I SAVED YOUR LIFE
WHEN YOU GOT SHOT. DIDN'T I?

37:55.844 --> 37:57.506
YES.

37:57.506 --> 37:59.478
AND FOR THAT,
I OWE YOU A DEBT.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.009
WHICH I PLAN ON COLLECTING.

38:01.009 --> 38:04.282
AND I THOUGHT THAT INSTEAD
OF TRYING TO FIND YOU,

38:04.282 --> 38:05.954
IT'D BE EASIER TO JUST
STAY CLOSE TO EMILY

38:05.954 --> 38:07.316
AND HOPE YOU SHOWED UP.

38:07.316 --> 38:08.517
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

38:08.517 --> 38:10.359
WELL, I'M HERE,

38:10.359 --> 38:11.560
SO USE ME.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.622
FINE.

38:13.622 --> 38:15.394
YOU STAY CLOSE TO EMILY.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.565
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO--

38:16.565 --> 38:19.368
DON'T TRUST THE GRAYSONS.

38:19.368 --> 38:21.500
I KNOW. I REMEMBER.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.302
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT I TOLD YOU?

38:24.302 --> 38:25.774
YES.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.712
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.791
YOU'RE GETTING RID OF IT?

38:42.791 --> 38:44.393
IT'S BEEN TARNISHED,

38:44.393 --> 38:46.825
AND THUS LOST
ITS UNIQUE APPEAL.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.829
I'M SORRY
FOR LETTING YOU DOWN.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.602
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW TO LIVE
YOUR LIFE, PATRICK,

38:53.602 --> 38:55.634
OR WHO TO LIVE IT WITH.

38:55.634 --> 38:56.965
DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

38:56.965 --> 38:59.408
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

38:59.408 --> 39:02.040
SOMEONE HURTS YOU,
AND YOU RUN.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.642
THAT'S YOUR M.O., RIGHT?

39:05.674 --> 39:07.546
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
PUSH ME AWAY.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.918
NO, I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
WE'RE A TEAM.

39:09.918 --> 39:12.781
SO I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

39:12.781 --> 39:14.352
AND TOGETHER,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE DOWN

39:14.352 --> 39:16.485
EVERYONE WHO EVER
WRONGED YOU--

39:16.485 --> 39:19.027
CONRAD, EMILY, AND NOLAN.

39:19.027 --> 39:21.590
HE KEEPS THIS, UM, BOX

39:21.590 --> 39:23.432
LOCKED UP BEHIND THE PAINTING
THAT HE TOOK FROM YOU.

39:23.432 --> 39:26.094
UH, IT'S GOT THIS DESIGN ETCHED
ON THE SIDE OF IT.

39:26.094 --> 39:28.096
TWO INFINITY SYMBOLS.
THEY'RE LINKED TOGETHER.

39:28.096 --> 39:30.639
I SWEAR I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

39:44.653 --> 39:46.585
WAS IT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

39:48.116 --> 39:50.158
IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THAT.

39:53.762 --> 39:56.595
THERE'S SOMETHING
SO FAMILIAR ABOUT YOU.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.597
WELL, WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.569
SORT OF.

40:00.569 --> 40:03.532
(inhales deeply)
THERE'S KIND OF A BIG GAP THERE.

40:03.532 --> 40:05.574
WHAT HAPPENED?

40:05.574 --> 40:08.937
I LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.812
(sighs) I HATE THIS.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.744
I-I FEEL SO HELPLESS.

40:15.744 --> 40:17.516
(breathes deeply)

40:17.516 --> 40:18.817
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

40:18.817 --> 40:21.450
YOU ARE THE STRONGEST PERSON
I HAVE EVER KNOWN.

40:21.450 --> 40:23.091
(exhales and sniffles)

40:23.091 --> 40:25.894
(whispers) PEOPLE KEEP SAYING
THINGS LIKE THAT.

40:25.894 --> 40:27.425
(exhales deeply)

40:27.425 --> 40:28.857
I DON'T FEEL IT.

40:28.857 --> 40:31.129
TRUST ME.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.061
YOU ARE THE TOUGHEST,

40:33.061 --> 40:36.134
MOST ANNOYINGLY BULLHEADED
PERSON ON THE PLANET.

40:37.966 --> 40:41.940
EMILY, I'LL ADMIT THAT
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES I...

40:41.940 --> 40:43.942
NEVER WANTED
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.474
BUT...

40:47.646 --> 40:50.649
(necklace clatters)

40:52.080 --> 40:55.554
THEN YOU LEFT ME THIS.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.026
(inhales deeply) WHAT IS IT?

40:58.026 --> 40:59.828
IT BELONGED TO MY WIFE.

40:59.828 --> 41:01.590
AMANDA.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.662
SHE WAS WEARING IT
WHEN SHE DIED.

41:03.662 --> 41:04.933
AND YOU WERE THERE.

41:04.933 --> 41:08.667
I KNOW YOU DON'T REMEMBER THIS,
BUT WE HAD A BIG FIGHT ABOUT IT.

41:08.667 --> 41:12.571
WE'VE... HAD A LOT OF FIGHTS
THIS SUMMER, ACTUALLY.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.773
THAT'S MY FAULT. I...

41:14.773 --> 41:18.607
I'VE BEEN HOLDING ON
TO ALL THAT PAIN AND...

41:18.607 --> 41:20.579
AND ANGER,
AND PUTTING IT ON YOU.

41:20.579 --> 41:24.513
IT'S NOT FAIR.

41:24.513 --> 41:27.616
(inhales deeply)
I'M SO SORRY.

41:27.616 --> 41:31.059
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY
ON THE BEACH.

41:39.127 --> 41:41.530
(whispers) COME BACK TO US,
EMILY THORNE.

41:46.675 --> 41:49.608
(breathes deeply)

41:49.608 --> 41:51.610
(grunts and pants)

41:51.610 --> 41:52.781
(voice breaks) OH, MY GOD.

41:52.781 --> 41:54.082
(grunts)
 (sobs) I'M SO SORRY.

41:54.082 --> 41:55.944
(whispers) DON'T BE.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.719
(gasps)

42:06.595 --> 42:08.196
(gasps)

42:08.196 --> 42:09.558
(whispering) DANIEL.

42:13.702 --> 42:14.933
NO.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.104
IT'S JACK.

42:16.104 --> 42:18.106
DANIEL.

42:21.009 --> 42:23.712
DANIEL SHOT ME.
