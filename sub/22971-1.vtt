No, you're right. That can't work.

into the Darklands.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.432

How does one open a bridge
to save the Trollhunter

06:33.726 --> 06:37.146
when one needs a Trollhunter
to open said bridge?

06:37.230 --> 06:40.900

Think, Blinkous, think!

06:41.609 --> 06:42.819
Any luck, Blink?

06:42.902 --> 06:46.656
Per usual, I'm never short on plans,
but a working one? No.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.743
I must say, it is most frustrating
to find oneself without any options.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.287
What about you, Tobias?
Any fortune with the fetch?

06:53.371 --> 06:55.998
I've been sticking my head through
this thing everywhere in Arcadia.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.584
All I see is endless Darklands. No Jim.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.421
But I have been leaving Nougat Nummies
to let him know we haven't given up...

07:02.505 --> 07:05.258

to enter the Darklands

08:23.544 --> 08:25.087
