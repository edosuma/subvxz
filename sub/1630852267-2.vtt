02:16.960 --> 02:19.880
A pickpocket.
Ran in here to hide.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.880

for some time.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.920
Maybe in Missing Persons?

03:18.920 --> 03:21.680
Vienna has become a rat's warren.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.960
People go missing every day.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.840
This whole room is one giant litany
of them.

03:26.840 --> 03:31.920
If anyone can find him,
I'm sure that you can, Fraulein.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.840
I spend every working hour in here,
Inspector.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.880
The dead have become my family.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.040
Here he is.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.080
Schwaiger. A railway clerk.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.400
You're sure about the name?

04:13.400 --> 04:14.760
Why?

04:16.800 --> 04:19.640
Emil Schwaiger went missing
20 years ago.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.560
Hello?

04:41.600 --> 04:43.600
Will you tell me your name?

04:46.200 --> 04:48.000
Where do you come from?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.320
Do you have a family?

05:10.160 --> 05:11.520
That slum...

05:13.400 --> 05:15.160
..have you ever been there before?

05:20.320 --> 05:24.360
Maybe you use it as a place
to hide, sometimes.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.760
Have you ever seen anyone else
round there?

07:38.400 --> 07:40.240
Thanks for bringing me.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.440
You hated it.
No, no. I-I enjoyed it.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.880
You didn't want to be here at all.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.080
Your mind was on your work
tonight.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.560
You witnessed
a brutal murder today.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.840
How did you figure that out?

07:53.840 --> 07:56.680
Little clues in one's behaviour,
remember?

07:56.680 --> 08:00.320
You ought to be in a circus.
You'd make a fortune with this act.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.680
Well?

08:03.680 --> 08:07.000
Schubert. Every time she sang
the word blood,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.240
you patted your pocket,
where you keep your notebook.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.040
Also, you kept rubbing
at your wrists.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.800
A body in Landstrasse,
a particularly brutal murder.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.240
You've witnessed brutal murders
before. This one was different.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.120
A man who vanished 20 years ago
suddenly turns up dead.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.960
Hand severed.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.000
Hence the wrists.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.040
The wound was just a few days old.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.680
Where's he been hiding
all these years?

08:40.680 --> 08:43.720
Would you like me
to get acquainted with him?

09:06.200 --> 09:08.960
Substantial blood loss
from the severed hand,

09:08.960 --> 09:11.520
and also his tongue was cut out

09:11.520 --> 09:15.840
and stuffed back in his gullet.
Nasty business.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.760
Well?

09:17.760 --> 09:19.800
What do you see, Max?

09:19.800 --> 09:23.520
Do you think Dr Liebermann will
notice something that I missed?

09:23.520 --> 09:26.440
You get to tell me how he died,
Dr Jaeger.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.760
Dr Liebermann might be able
to tell me how he lived.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.960
He was bound and tortured?

09:35.960 --> 09:39.880
Piano wire, particularly barbaric.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.200
This isn't just a murder.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.200
The act itself gives us
a profile of the killer.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.240
Why torture a man?

09:52.440 --> 09:54.440
Most likely to get information.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.520
And?

09:57.520 --> 10:00.040
If he won't provide it...

10:01.640 --> 10:03.720
..if his tongue won't move?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.760
He punished him by removing it.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.640
Not a day goes by
when I don't think of him.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.600
I just need to know what's happened.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.560
I need to know
how my brother's life ended.

10:58.520 --> 11:03.920
I don't understand.
Is this some sort of a joke?

11:05.440 --> 11:07.480
What's the matter, Frau Schwaiger?

11:09.880 --> 11:11.880
It's not Emil.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.240
It's not my brother.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.560
How long since you've seen him?
Are you absolutely sure?

11:17.560 --> 11:21.280
I'm absolutely sure!
It's not my brother.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.840
Papa?

11:53.840 --> 11:55.840
Is that the Satin de Lyon?

11:55.840 --> 11:59.240
It cost an arm and a leg. Be nice.
DOOR OPENS

11:59.240 --> 12:01.920
It's very...lovely.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.000
Hm, very convincing.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.840
Would you like to see
my other option?

12:06.840 --> 12:09.080
Max, have you seen the headline?

12:10.640 --> 12:13.320
What do YOU think?Of?

12:13.320 --> 12:15.040
The dress.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.960
Papa and Mama's
wedding anniversary.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.920
You haven't forgotten?

12:21.920 --> 12:24.040
No, of course not.

12:25.720 --> 12:30.200
I've invited Jonas Korngold,
as we do so much business together.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.600
He's likely to bring Clara.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.320
I hope you don't mind.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.760
No... No, why should I?

12:41.640 --> 12:45.320
Perhaps,
perhaps I'LL invite someone.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.440
- May I?
- A girl?

12:47.440 --> 12:49.040
Yes. Obviously.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.400
I don't think the Inspector
will be keen.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.080
Well, who are you going to ask?

12:54.080 --> 12:57.120
What about Fraulein Spitzer?
Your mother's very eager...

12:57.120 --> 13:00.720
Um, actually I-I was thinking
of Miss Lydgate.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.640
The patient?

13:03.640 --> 13:06.520
She's not my patient any more.
She hasn't been for some time now.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.560
And you want to bring her
to our anniversary party?

13:09.560 --> 13:11.600
She won't embarrass you, Mama.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.920
She doesn't slurp her soup
or chew with her mouth open.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.680
I'll ask her to change out of her
hospital gowns and manacles.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.480
What she wears is scarcely
the point.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.360
You're going to give me another
lecture

13:20.360 --> 13:23.160
on the fact she's not Jewish?
Oh, Mama.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.280
If you beg him to do something,
he's bound to do the opposite.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.040
Aha, and that's psychology,
isn't it?

13:33.600 --> 13:36.960
Census records, identity papers,
everything in order.

13:42.720 --> 13:47.800
We have a reliable witness who
claims that this is not Schwaiger.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.560
That's impossible.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.640
Then, someone's been tampering
with our official records.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.240
Curiouser and curiouser.

14:03.480 --> 14:07.440
Inspector... Inspector,
I think you need to come.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.600
This is not a home for vagrants,
Rheinhardt.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.200
She's too young to be detained.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.560
We can't put her in the cells.
She's a valuable witness.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.720
We can't just let her
out on the streets again.

14:21.720 --> 14:26.520
Well, she can't stay here.
What else do we know about her?

14:26.520 --> 14:29.160
Nothing. No family. No address.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.720
She was picking pockets
when we found her.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.640
She's been using that slum
as a place to hide out.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.920
This was clutched in her hand.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.360
TICKING

14:44.960 --> 14:48.400
Do you think you can get her
to talk to us?

15:08.600 --> 15:10.160
It's all right.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.600
I'm Max. I'm a doctor.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.600
What's YOUR name?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.720
Is this yours?

15:31.280 --> 15:34.160
MUSIC PLAYS

15:42.640 --> 15:45.040
It's all right.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.920
Er, fetch some water.

15:48.320 --> 15:51.640
It's all right. Breathe.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.000
She's in shock.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.520
Deeply traumatised.
She needs urgent care.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.400
Maybe the hospital is willing
to take her in?

16:00.400 --> 16:02.120
Their methods are too brutal.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.600
Of course,
you Freudians know everything.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.400
Well, where CAN we send her, then?

16:12.960 --> 16:14.600
Max. I don't understand.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.600
Well, she needs somewhere
to stay. Just for a few days.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.680
Is she a patient?

16:20.680 --> 16:24.600
She's a potential witness,
in a murder case.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.360
And you don't even know her name?

16:27.360 --> 16:30.200
Take her upstairs, would you?
Have the spare room made up.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.560
Wouldn't she be better
at the hospital?

16:32.560 --> 16:35.240
Mama, I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.600
Bless you, Mama.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.000
You'll have everything you need
here.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.720
My mother will take good care
of you.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.440
I'll be back very soon.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.080
I'll come and look in on you.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.520
Whoa! Rheinhardt?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.880
Direktor Strasser?

17:59.880 --> 18:02.080
It's good to see you again.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.960
Get in, ride with me.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.040
I heard about your new case.
Landstrasse.

18:16.040 --> 18:20.560
Every murder case comes across
my desk. Where are you

18:20.560 --> 18:23.600
with the investigation?
It's a confusing picture.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.120
The victim's been wrongly
identified. Well,

18:27.120 --> 18:29.280
no need to concern yourself.

18:29.280 --> 18:32.560
I'm taking it away from you,
assigning a different department.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.440
What?!

18:34.440 --> 18:37.800
No need to involve yourself
any further.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.360
I don't understand.
Why am I being taken off the case?

18:42.480 --> 18:46.360
Some things are outside
your jurisdiction,

18:46.360 --> 18:49.000
best not to ask too many questions.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.280
Agh!

19:42.160 --> 19:44.000
Are you all right, Inspector?

19:48.600 --> 19:52.000
I've just received a message
concerning the dead man.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.520
"The name is Anton Resch"?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.000
The body we examined yesterday.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.240
I've been sent an anonymous tip-off.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.440
The real identity of the victim.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.640
Anton Resch.

20:16.640 --> 20:20.000
Well...at last we have a lead.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.480
I was taken off the case.What?

20:23.480 --> 20:27.040
Yeah, Direktor Strasser has
reassigned it.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.080
I'm obliged to hand this over to
the next investigating officer,

20:30.080 --> 20:31.560
whoever that may be.

20:33.280 --> 20:36.200
This letter was sent to you
personally.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.760
Are you really
going to give it up that easily?

20:44.360 --> 20:46.280
At least talk to Amelia first.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.320
Hopefully we can extrapolate
some information.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.920
Perhaps where the letter
was written?

21:09.760 --> 21:11.960
Information about the sender.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.000
Nothing we do is anonymous,
not any more.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.760
The touch of someone's hand can
leave a mark, it's indelible.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.360
Could you?

21:47.360 --> 21:50.360
Oh, there was something else
inside.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.680
Here.

21:56.480 --> 22:00.160
Freshly plucked -
traces of blood on the barbs. Look.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.840
Why would someone send me
a bird's feather?

22:05.840 --> 22:09.520
Corvus corone. What?
Carrion crow.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.480
The messenger of the dead.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.120
I'll take these to the museum,
continue my analysis.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.840
Actually,
I wanted to ask you something.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.640
Er, perhaps if I came by tomorrow?

22:32.840 --> 22:34.320
Inspector.

22:41.880 --> 22:45.400
How is it progressing,
you and Miss Lydgate?

22:46.680 --> 22:49.400
Do you have to enjoy my discomfort
quite so much?

22:49.400 --> 22:50.840
Yes, I do.

22:53.360 --> 22:57.560
Whoever the killer is,
he's got a traitor close at hand.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.640
Someone wants to help me solve
this.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.600
Inspector.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.080
I found him. He's an Officer.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.800
Anton Resch.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.640
Wait...

23:16.160 --> 23:17.880
There is Strasser.

23:26.440 --> 23:30.320
The dead man is Anton Resch,
an officer, 4th district,

23:30.320 --> 23:32.240
we found him in a photograph.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.720
You were in it too, Herr Direktor.

23:35.880 --> 23:39.680
Ah. Why was he calling himself
a different name?

23:39.680 --> 23:41.920
And who is this "Schwaiger"?

23:41.920 --> 23:44.400
Missing person from the files.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.760
It's common practice
when creating a false identity.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.800
Use a name already
in the public records.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.960
So, he was working undercover?

23:53.960 --> 23:57.960
Hmm, I'm not obliged
to discuss operations with you,

23:57.960 --> 24:01.720
Rheinhardt.
This is way above your head.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.400
You're dismissed.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.040
I have other evidence
for you Herr Direktor.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.760
The informant sent me a symbol.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.720
What symbol?

24:20.720 --> 24:23.600
A feather. Carrion crow.

24:26.240 --> 24:28.040
Do you know what it signifies?

24:28.040 --> 24:31.040
I've told you,
this is not your domain.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.000
Herr Direktor,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.120
the informant chose
to contact me personally.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.920
I don't know why. All I know is,

24:39.920 --> 24:42.920
he thinks there's some bond
between us.

24:44.720 --> 24:48.120
It's reasonable to assume
that he will contact me again.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.800
Please, let me help.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.680
Crow? Yes, sir.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.280
It's a code name.

25:12.280 --> 25:16.800
Someone we've been tracking for
a while now. A dangerous criminal.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.920
His real name is Lazar Kiss,

25:20.920 --> 25:25.800
a mercenary.
Half-Serb, half-Hungarian.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.080
And you think this man is
in Vienna?

25:32.560 --> 25:35.200
Kiss is largely unknown to us.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.920
We don't even have a photograph.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.920
He's suspected of involvement
in the assassination of

25:40.920 --> 25:43.520
the Serbian royal family.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.480
Our agent was ordered
to track him down.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.920
Apparently, he got too close.

25:52.800 --> 25:56.160
I'm grateful for your report,
Rheinhardt.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.720
But...

25:57.720 --> 26:01.240
..anything else you receive
from this informant,

26:01.240 --> 26:04.040
you bring it straight to me, hmm?

26:14.120 --> 26:18.600
Anything your patients say to you,
you're not allowed to repeat?

26:18.600 --> 26:21.040
That's how it works, yes.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.120
Very well,
I want to pay you for your time.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.400
Well, that will
buy you about two minutes.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.440
What's this about, Oskar?
What's going on?

26:31.040 --> 26:32.680
A conversation I had just now.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.360
I need to discuss it with someone,
in complete confidence.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.680
A secret investigation?

26:41.680 --> 26:45.000
I've been ordered to remain
at arm's length.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.360
To do nothing.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.160
Mm-hm.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.640
And you don't want to.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.880
Of course not, I'm involved.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.480
The informant sent me that message.

26:55.480 --> 26:59.240
What do the Secret Services
know about Kiss?

26:59.240 --> 27:03.720
Nothing, only rumours.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.360
He's no more than a shadow,
a whisper.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.440
They're trying to find a man
that no-one has ever laid eyes on.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.320
The informant is trying to point me
the way to him.

27:15.040 --> 27:20.960
So, you're going to conduct your own
secret investigation?

27:24.800 --> 27:26.960
Would you like some company?

27:28.840 --> 27:31.280
Help me build a profile of him.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.320
Who is he, Max?

27:50.120 --> 27:51.680
The Crow?

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
Brutal, sadistic, paranoid.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.000
Killed an officer
in the most savage way

28:03.000 --> 28:04.760
when he wouldn't break
under torture.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.080
Then again...

28:08.080 --> 28:09.880
What?

28:09.880 --> 28:11.600
What is it?

28:11.600 --> 28:15.280
Well, if you wanted to slip into
the shadows, if you wanted

28:15.280 --> 28:17.440
the Secret Service off your back,

28:17.440 --> 28:21.600
would you really carry out an
execution in such a...

28:21.600 --> 28:23.320
..theatrical manner?

28:23.320 --> 28:26.240
The severed hand,
the severed tongue?

28:30.400 --> 28:33.880
What about the girl?
Anything from her yet?

28:33.880 --> 28:35.960
She's still in a state of shock.

28:37.320 --> 28:41.120
All right, we go step by step.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.840
We need to begin by finding
this mystery informant.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.560
Is it my turn to say it?

28:47.560 --> 28:48.920
I think it's my turn.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.560
Well, go on, then.

28:52.280 --> 28:55.280
Welcome to the case, Doctor.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.920
You don't say it as well as I do.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.960
I'll try to work on it.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.520
How are you feeling?

29:20.520 --> 29:23.240
Are you feeling any better?

29:25.120 --> 29:27.200
I've brought a friend along.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.440
I wanted to introduce you to him.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.720
You can see he's a little bit sad.

29:45.760 --> 29:49.320
I think something bad may have
happened to him.

29:49.320 --> 29:54.760
Or, perhaps he saw something
that made him upset.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.680
If you make friends with him,

30:06.680 --> 30:09.800
I think he'll tell you
all his secrets.

30:58.360 --> 31:02.040
TRUMPET SOUNDS

31:07.200 --> 31:08.840
WHISTLE BLOWS

31:08.840 --> 31:12.120
Alarm!

31:21.600 --> 31:25.320
The dust contained in the envelope
has tiny fragments of fibre.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.840
Hemp, I think. Rope.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.560
Also some fragments of paint in it.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.000
Thank you, Miss Lydgate.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.800
Er, wait for me a moment.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.200
I like him your Inspector.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.840
He's not my Inspector.

31:50.840 --> 31:54.080
Well, you're always in each
other's company.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.120
I wanted to ask you something.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.920
You're not going to try
and kiss me again?

32:00.480 --> 32:03.120
What is it about this laboratory?

32:03.120 --> 32:06.160
I wanted to invite you out
for the evening.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.680
Max, we've been through this before.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.440
It's a party.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.680
Everyone likes parties.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.880
I wasn't playing games with you,
when I told you no before.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.000
I like you, Max.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.160
You know I like you.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.000
But the last thing that either of us
needs right now

32:27.000 --> 32:29.240
is for our lives
to become complicated.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.840
Clara's engaged again.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.040
She's going to be married.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.720
There's nothing complicated.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.640
I want to be with you and...

32:46.640 --> 32:51.360
..and I think you want to be
with me.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.520
A simple chemical equation.

33:01.840 --> 33:06.720
Max, there's been an incident.
Schonbrunn.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.080
Dear Christ.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.560
It's addressed to you, Inspector.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.160
We've been trying to contact you.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.800
It's the same.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.040
Yes.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.440
Exact same hand
as the anonymous letter.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.720
What happened?

33:35.720 --> 33:39.160
I discovered it late last night,
right before dawn, right here.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.520
Resch?

33:40.520 --> 33:42.680
It's the same wound pattern.

33:42.680 --> 33:47.160
Question is, why would someone leave
it here for me?

33:47.160 --> 33:52.760
Authenticity. Whoever this person
is, they want you to believe them.

33:52.760 --> 33:56.400
They want to prove they were present
at the death of the victim.

33:58.360 --> 34:02.200
Still, why go to all the trouble
of hopping the fence to deliver it?

34:05.360 --> 34:07.280
Oh.

34:07.280 --> 34:10.000
Apparently,
he wants to meet face-to-face.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.720
A severed hand?

34:11.720 --> 34:16.040
Must be a symbol of some kind.
It must have some significance.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.560
The hand was painted with tar,
blackened.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.480
The Black Hand.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.240
Here.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.920
Black Hand is a political movement.

34:47.920 --> 34:52.120
Their aim is to unite all the Balkan
nations under the Serbian flag.

34:52.120 --> 34:56.600
Unification or death.
A bunch of extremists.

34:56.600 --> 35:00.120
You think Lazar Kiss is
connected to them somehow?

35:00.120 --> 35:03.240
Strasser told me
he was a gun for hire.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.080
I've got some clean clothes for you.

35:13.080 --> 35:16.200
You're the same size
as our neighbour's girl, just about.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.800
Anna will help you.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.240
We'll see about getting
your other things darned.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.680
Yes?

36:13.480 --> 36:15.200
Would you like to try?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.080
My name's Leah.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.320
I'm Max's sister.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.800
Here.

36:27.440 --> 36:28.840
It's all right.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.040
You don't need to be nervous.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.920
There, beautiful.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.000
Just like you.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.800
What's your name?

37:05.160 --> 37:06.840
Lily.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.680
Hello, Lily.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.960
They come here seeking a new life.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.120
Vienna is the end of the rainbow.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.360
It should be around here somewhere.

37:53.920 --> 37:58.360
Hemp-rope and paint.
Amelia was right.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.440
Might be dangerous.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.120
You first.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.640
I'll have a look around.

38:33.640 --> 38:34.800
Wait here.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.280
Try not to get stabbed.

38:40.280 --> 38:43.240
That's good advice. Thank you.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.720
Black Hand?

40:53.720 --> 40:55.760
Yes, of course I know them.

40:55.760 --> 40:59.080
They make a lot of protests
in our country.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.520
Apparently, they've crossed the
border into Austria.

41:02.520 --> 41:06.280
Do you know who might be
responsible? Oh, no, no.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.280
I don't want to get involved.

41:08.280 --> 41:11.120
These kind of people,
they are fanatics, crazy-men.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.640
But talk to Zivko.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.880
Zivko?

41:15.080 --> 41:17.760
The actor.
He knows everyone.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.640
Black Hand, you know them?

41:28.640 --> 41:31.520
Young student.
Scrawny chap.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.760
Saw him in here last night.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.320
A student?

41:35.320 --> 41:38.160
Heard him spouting forth
about Serbian unification.

41:38.160 --> 41:43.200
He definitely said that name,
Black Hand.

41:45.120 --> 41:48.200
Have you got an address for this
student fellow?

41:48.200 --> 41:51.960
Sure, and I took his fingerprints.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.920
A lot of the students
live in the same street.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.040
Hollandstrasse.

42:05.960 --> 42:09.240
There's an old man there,
takes them all in.

42:09.240 --> 42:10.960
Spiridon.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.480
What about the student?

42:12.480 --> 42:13.880
What's his name?

42:13.880 --> 42:15.240
Vrana.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.160
Thank you.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.400
Vrana means Crow.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.760
We've found him, Max.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.320
We've found Lazar Kiss.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.520
You're sure he's not here?

42:46.520 --> 42:47.880
Never ever see him.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.040
Slips the money under my door,

42:50.040 --> 42:52.360
minds his own business.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.000
We all do round here.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.360
Thank you.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.920
What is it? What's wrong?

44:16.160 --> 44:17.520
What have you found?

44:29.560 --> 44:34.240
This messenger of death,
who has he come here to kill?

44:44.080 --> 44:45.600
We found guns.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.800
And ammunition. Hidden.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.720
What took you to the apartment?

44:49.720 --> 44:52.400
A witness, at the Serbian theatre.

44:52.400 --> 44:55.680
An informant told me
to meet him there.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.160
Here is his note.

44:58.680 --> 45:00.600
Who is this informant?

45:00.600 --> 45:03.800
Never showed,
but another witness came forward.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.400
He heard a young man, a student,

45:05.400 --> 45:07.440
singing the praises
of the Black Hand.

45:07.440 --> 45:11.280
What were you doing, following
leads, questioning witnesses?

45:11.280 --> 45:14.760
I made it clear this is
not your case any more.

45:14.760 --> 45:17.200
You asked me to bring any
available evidence.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.720
That's all I was doing, sir.

45:19.720 --> 45:22.360
We don't need the Leopoldstadt
police

45:22.360 --> 45:24.680
wading into this investigation.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.720
The situation is delicate,
Rheinhardt.

45:26.720 --> 45:31.080
I'd say Inspector Rheinhardt has
done us all a service.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.960
Aehrenthal.
Ministry of the Interior.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.800
I'm in charge here.

45:37.800 --> 45:42.240
Sir, this informant, whoever he is,

45:42.240 --> 45:45.200
keeps trying to make
contact with me.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.760
Maybe I can help.

45:49.520 --> 45:52.240
But right now I'm just
walking around blind.

45:53.960 --> 45:58.080
This government plans to make
a statement of our dominance

45:58.080 --> 45:59.240
in the Balkans.

45:59.240 --> 46:00.520
A statement?

46:00.520 --> 46:02.520
That's all
you need to know, Rheinhardt.

46:02.520 --> 46:05.240
We're going to eliminate,
once and for all,

46:05.240 --> 46:08.400
the Serbian threat
to our sovereignty.

46:08.400 --> 46:13.400
Kiss has obviously been
hired by people who oppose us.

46:13.400 --> 46:16.240
Please, let me do my job.

46:16.240 --> 46:18.240
Let me find Kiss.

46:18.240 --> 46:20.200
He's going to come back
for the guns.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.160
I'm already one step closer to him.

46:22.160 --> 46:26.480
Well, we need someone to run
surveillance, don't we?

46:28.280 --> 46:30.960
You're obviously our man, Inspector.

46:30.960 --> 46:34.120
I'm bringing you
into the investigation.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.680
Watch the apartment.

46:38.680 --> 46:43.520
If he returns, don't make
an immediate arrest.

46:43.520 --> 46:47.720
We need to follow the trail,
discover the whole network.

46:53.680 --> 46:56.880
Keep the operation tightly closed.

46:56.880 --> 47:01.560
Just one or two officers,
and you report to me, not Von Bulow.

47:01.560 --> 47:04.760
He knows nothing, understand?

47:04.760 --> 47:08.200
I hope that's not going to be
a problem for you.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.520
Everything all right, Mama?

47:22.520 --> 47:24.040
Max, you're early.

47:24.040 --> 47:25.240
Yes. How's our guest?

47:25.240 --> 47:26.600
Go up and see.
She's with Leah.

47:26.600 --> 47:28.160
Max, tell me honestly.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.080
What is she doing here?

47:30.080 --> 47:33.920
I told you,
she's possibly an important witness

47:33.920 --> 47:36.160
and we need her testimony.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.080
Why did you lock her door?

47:38.080 --> 47:40.280
Max, I have no idea who she is.

47:40.280 --> 47:42.920
She is clearly a beggar,
judging by her clothing.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.440
I can't give her
the run of the house.

47:44.440 --> 47:46.120
Be reasonable.

47:46.120 --> 47:48.440
I need to find out where she's from.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.560
She must have a family somewhere.

47:50.560 --> 47:52.200
If I can get her to open up to me

47:52.200 --> 47:54.600
then maybe we can help her
get back to them.

48:05.560 --> 48:07.640
Max. I need to introduce you.

48:09.440 --> 48:11.200
This is Lily.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.880
It's good to meet you, Lily.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.200
You seem to be feeling better.

48:23.920 --> 48:27.240
I'll leave you two alone,
for a minute.

48:38.520 --> 48:41.000
Your new friend is looking
better too.

48:44.560 --> 48:47.280
Still, I'd like to know
what was wrong with her.

48:47.280 --> 48:49.920
Did you have a chance to talk
to each other?

48:53.440 --> 48:55.520
I know he's just a bear.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.720
I know he's not real.

49:00.920 --> 49:05.520
Still, what if he were real?

49:08.560 --> 49:10.520
What would he be feeling?

49:20.600 --> 49:22.520
How about a drink?

49:22.520 --> 49:25.520
What's wrong, Inspector?

49:25.520 --> 49:27.880
Nothing.
Why should anything be wrong?

49:27.880 --> 49:31.400
You've never offered me
a drink before.

49:31.400 --> 49:33.880
We've worked together for years.

49:33.880 --> 49:35.280
All right.

49:35.280 --> 49:37.280
I need to ask you something.

49:37.280 --> 49:40.360
There's a house in Hollandstrasse.
I need to run surveillance.

49:40.360 --> 49:41.480
Of course.

49:41.480 --> 49:44.200
No. Wait a minute. Hear me out.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.560
None of it can be official.

49:51.360 --> 49:52.640
I don't understand.

49:52.640 --> 49:57.160
The body in Landstrasse, Von Bulow
mustn't know what we're up to.

49:59.400 --> 50:01.160
Seriously?

50:01.160 --> 50:04.320
By order of the Chief
of Police.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.840
Von Bulow has so many cases on his
mind he won't notice us.

50:07.840 --> 50:11.720
It's two officers,
two 12 hour shifts.

50:11.720 --> 50:14.920
We find a room overlooking
the suspect's apartment.

50:30.480 --> 50:32.040
Here, this is the place.

51:32.640 --> 51:35.680
Come here.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.760
Ah, lovely!

51:44.760 --> 51:46.440
Do you remember this, darling?

51:46.440 --> 51:48.760
I do remember it. Thank you so much.

51:48.760 --> 51:50.920
You're welcome.
This is Sofia.

51:50.920 --> 51:53.840
Yes, hello, Sofia.

51:57.040 --> 52:00.280
Where's your necklace?
Oh.

52:22.520 --> 52:25.080
I do hope
you're going to liven up a bit.

52:25.080 --> 52:27.800
What is wrong with you tonight?
Nothing.

52:27.800 --> 52:30.840
Go and enjoy yourself,
I'm just waiting for my guest.

52:30.840 --> 52:33.440
Ah, yes,
the famous Miss Lydgate.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.280
Your mother and I can't wait.

52:43.880 --> 52:46.040
That's the trouble with Vienna.

52:46.040 --> 52:49.320
You keep bumping into people
you'd rather avoid.

52:52.040 --> 52:54.360
Lovely to see you, Clara.
No, it isn't.

52:54.360 --> 52:58.480
I think we can be honest,
you and I. Is your Inspector here?

52:58.480 --> 53:02.160
You barely seem to be apart.
Actually, no.

53:02.160 --> 53:05.440
I was just teasing, Max.
Oh, right.

53:05.440 --> 53:08.520
Surely I'm still allowed to do that.

53:08.520 --> 53:11.400
Is there someone new in your life?

53:14.240 --> 53:17.440
Clara, please. You don't seem
to have a guest tonight?

53:17.440 --> 53:20.760
What about the woman you shunned me
for?Clara.

53:20.760 --> 53:25.080
Where is she, Max? I'm insatiably
curious to get to know her.

53:26.400 --> 53:29.960
You can say what you want.
It doesn't matter now.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.720
Haven't you heard, Jonas and I are
engaged.

53:35.440 --> 53:38.400
Er, yes.
Actually, father told me.

53:38.400 --> 53:41.240
The invitations have all
gone out.

53:43.240 --> 53:44.760
Mazel Tov.

53:46.280 --> 53:50.960
He adores me,
has done for years.

53:50.960 --> 53:55.480
What happened between you and me
is in the past now.

53:55.480 --> 53:58.000
I really do want you to be happy.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.640
It would make it so much neater
for all of us.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.680
Is it the scientist?

54:03.680 --> 54:05.720
Is that who you're expecting?

54:07.920 --> 54:09.520
And do you love her?

54:12.000 --> 54:14.160
You probably don't even know
yourself.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.320
Are you happy, Clara?

54:21.600 --> 54:23.520
I'm not your patient.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.480
You don't have the right
to ask me that.

54:30.480 --> 54:32.080
Ah, beautiful Clara.

54:32.080 --> 54:33.640
Hello, Clara. Mazel Tov.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.200
Mazel Tov. We were just talking
about you.

54:59.040 --> 55:02.080
SHOUTING AND CRYING

55:33.920 --> 55:37.600
Don't look at me, please.
Don't look at me.

55:37.600 --> 55:39.240
Are you all right?

55:41.440 --> 55:43.800
Go. Please go. He will come back.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.600
Please go.

55:47.360 --> 55:50.000
He can't hurt you.
I'll protect you.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.480
Just go! Please!

55:53.480 --> 55:56.800
Please just go, please.

56:21.200 --> 56:23.640
I almost didn't come.

56:23.640 --> 56:26.760
I didn't want to risk
being the subject of gossip.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.040
Just two ordinary people.

56:30.040 --> 56:33.160
Ordinary isn't the way I was hoping
to be described, Max.

56:33.160 --> 56:35.160
Please.

56:37.840 --> 56:41.800
Darling, I have no idea who those
people were. The Leopolds.

56:41.800 --> 56:43.200
Ah!Erm... The other Leopolds.

56:46.880 --> 56:50.280
Max, this is the moment where you
introduce me to your parents.

56:50.280 --> 56:52.680
Yes, of course, erm...

56:52.680 --> 56:54.920
Their names are Mendel and Rachel.

56:54.920 --> 56:58.840
Right, erm, Mother, Father,
this is...

56:58.840 --> 57:00.320
Amelia.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.200
Lydgate.

57:02.200 --> 57:03.960
Erm, I owe you both an apology.

57:03.960 --> 57:06.360
Last time we met it was very
unfortunate.

57:06.360 --> 57:10.200
Max speaks about you both so warmly
and I wanted to get to know you.

57:10.200 --> 57:13.720
I wondered if we could begin
our acquaintance again.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.920
Welcome to our party.

57:16.920 --> 57:19.440
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

57:19.440 --> 57:22.040
You seem to be rather more
eloquent than my son.

57:22.040 --> 57:24.080
Not that that's much
of a distinction.

57:24.080 --> 57:25.800
My wife, Rachel.

57:27.360 --> 57:30.560
Come through,
we'll get you something to drink.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.480
Lily?

58:08.480 --> 58:11.360
Lily, what are you doing up?

58:11.360 --> 58:15.160
Lily? Lily, what's the matter,
darling?

58:17.240 --> 58:20.000
What's the matter? Lily?

58:20.000 --> 58:22.640
Max? Max.

58:22.640 --> 58:25.920
There's something's
the matter with Lily. Max!

58:25.920 --> 58:29.600
Lily, wait! Lily!

58:32.280 --> 58:35.600
Lily, stop!
Max!

58:35.600 --> 58:36.880
Wait!

58:39.120 --> 58:40.800
Max, what's wrong with her?

58:42.480 --> 58:44.560
Get her back inside.

58:44.560 --> 58:46.120
Get her out of the night air.

58:55.280 --> 58:57.240
Max, what is going on?

58:57.240 --> 58:59.520
It's all right,
she had a fit of some kind.

59:21.960 --> 59:23.680
I'm sorry to abandon you.

59:25.840 --> 59:27.280
She's a guest.

59:27.280 --> 59:28.800
She's not well.

59:28.800 --> 59:30.120
You're a doctor.

59:35.360 --> 59:38.840
Something she witnessed
has caused a powerful trauma.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.200
I can't explain it.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.640
I understand perfectly.

59:51.760 --> 59:55.240
We've been here before, you and I.

1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:35.640
PHONE RINGS

1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:47.640
Rheinhardt.

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:49.600
What?

1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:51.200
Get back there.

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:53.680
Don't lose sight of him.

1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:18.560
He's in there now.
Shall we go in and arrest him?

1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:20.880
We've been told just to watch him.

1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:23.880
We need to find out
if he has any accomplices.

1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:26.680
"Who holds the devil,
let him hold him well.

1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:29.280
"For he'll hardly be caught
a second time."

1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:33.640
Quick. He's on the move.

1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:35.360
Let's go.

1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:09.680
You're disappointed.

1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:11.160
What do you mean?

1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:14.240
I mean, you were expecting
the devil.

1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:18.480
You're disappointed he's just flesh
and blood, that he's real.

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:24.760
Oskar, Oskar, where are you going?

1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:53.760
Go there, go there.

1:02:57.560 --> 1:02:59.680
Max, on your left.

1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:28.200
Sir.

1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.400
I saw him, Max.

1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:03.640
I stared right in his face.

1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:06.960
Which way did he go?

1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:08.160
I don't know.

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.960
He's not here.
It's like he vanished.

1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:16.840
Max?

1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:18.440
Where are you going?

1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:23.800
Max?
Why come here in broad daylight?

1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:27.160
Why risk being seen?

1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:32.000
What are you doing?

1:05:02.920 --> 1:05:06.400
Ugovor predstoji.

1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:22.200
KNOCKING

1:05:22.200 --> 1:05:24.280
Come in.

1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:29.080
Herr Direktor?

1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:32.640
Excuse me. Rheinhardt,
what's Liebermann doing here?

1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:36.600
Who is this man? This is a highly
sensitive investigation.

1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:40.400
This is Doctor Liebermann, he works
with me. He's a psychoanalyst.

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:43.880
And you think that entitles him to
barge into this meeting?

1:05:43.880 --> 1:05:46.720
I'm trying to build a profile
of Kiss. A profile?

1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:50.000
A psychological picture, as useful
as any photograph.

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:54.520
Inspector, this is all highly
irregular.

1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:56.640
We found this, Sir.

1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:01.920
Kiss was trying to send a secret
message to someone.

1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:03.400
Well, fine.

1:06:03.400 --> 1:06:05.360
Translate it.

1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:09.160
Oh? 'Ugovor' means treaty.

1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:14.360
It says the treaty,
whatever it is, is imminent.

1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:20.640
Herr minister, I saw him up close.

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:23.720
I'm the only one who can
identify him.

1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:26.880
You need me at the heart of this
investigation.

1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:30.120
I beg you please,
tell me everything.

1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:45.400
Bosnia and Herzegovina are soon
to be incorporated into the Empire.

1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:51.720
The Serbs' unification dream
will be crushed.

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:54.800
Their ambitions will be
reduced to rubble.

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:57.920
And Kiss, why did he come to Vienna?

1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:04.640
Russian representatives are coming
to Austria in secret,

1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:07.000
to sign a treaty.

1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:11.440
On the fifth,
two days from now.

1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:14.400
And the treaty?

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:17.520
The annexation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:21.440
The Russians will permit
the annexation, unopposed,

1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:23.800
in return for...

1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:28.240
..certain military assurances.

1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:30.280
Kiss knows.

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:33.120
He's come here to prevent
the signing.

1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:35.520
We should never have let him go.

1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:50.560
Sergeant?

1:07:54.040 --> 1:07:55.360
Sir?

1:07:55.360 --> 1:07:58.040
Your presence is requested
in the archives.

1:07:58.040 --> 1:07:59.520
They have something for you.

1:08:42.440 --> 1:08:45.080
He assaulted you again?

1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:48.000
The man in your apartment?

1:08:51.080 --> 1:08:53.160
Will you let me help you?

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.520
You can't stay there.

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:15.080
You can't go back to him.

1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:16.840
It's dangerous for you.

1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:20.560
What other choice do I have?

1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:25.360
For some people, their life
is a prison.

1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:30.960
I have no money,
except what pittance

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:33.360
I get from looking after this place.

1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:37.680
I can't get away from him.

1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:41.240
What happens next time?

1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:46.400
What happens if he goes too far?

1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:51.080
Thank you.

1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:55.720
I've seen violence in the home,
my own father.

1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:01.760
You can stay here.

1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:05.120
The door is secure.

1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:06.960
He won't be able to touch you.

1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:10.960
Just stay out of sight.

1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:14.400
An angel sent from God.

1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:18.000
No, no.

1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:40.640
Inspector.

1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:42.280
Anything?

1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:45.160
Nothing. No sign of him.

1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:47.000
Hasn't returned.

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:50.000
One more day.
That's all we have.

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.040
Why? What's going on? There's an
event taking place tomorrow.

1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:57.520
He came here to prevent it from
happening.

1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:02.840
I can't believe it.

1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:08.600
What the hell is he doing?

1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:10.160
Damned idiot.

1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:13.520
What does he think
he's going to find?

1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:15.400
Kiss could be back any moment.

1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:24.520
Commissioner.
Commissioner Von Bulow.

1:11:24.520 --> 1:11:27.000
You need to get out of here.
Immediately.

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:31.280
What are you doing here, Rheinhardt?
I expect to be briefed.

1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:32.600
He'll come back.

1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:33.760
You can't stay here.

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:35.400
Who? Who?

1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:37.560
What is this about,
this investigation?

1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:39.600
Why haven't you reported it to me?

1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:41.960
You're spending my time
and resources,

1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:44.480
running surveillance on this street.

1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:46.680
I insist on being kept informed.

1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:48.320
Who's the subject?

1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:57.680
Assaulting a senior officer. You can
kiss your career goodbye.

1:11:57.680 --> 1:11:59.680
Search the place.

1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:01.920
Find out exactly
what's going on here.

1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:06.160
Help me, Commissioner!

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:07.440
Come on!

1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:10.640
Haussmann! Get him!

1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:13.840
Stop! Stop!

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:26.320
Where is he? Where is he?

1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:29.120
Rheinhardt! Don't let him get away.

1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:30.320
Who? Who?!

1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:33.000
Strasser ordered me to watch him.

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.600
This is an official operation.

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:37.120
Dear God.

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:40.520
Split up and find him. Find him!

1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:42.680
Split up and find him!

1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:45.120
God!

1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:56.920
If it were up to me, Von Bulow,
you'd be relieved of your command.

1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:00.840
Dismissed.

1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:06.360
Rheinhardt, you stay.

1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:07.600
We need to talk.

1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:19.720
You are the only one
who's seen Kiss up close.

1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:23.480
Your presence is requested
at the treaty signing.

1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:25.720
Noon tomorrow. Laxenburg.

1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:27.000
Thank you.

1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:04.400
Are you alone?

1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:07.320
I'm glad you're back.

1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:10.440
I feel safer knowing you're here.

1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:20.280
I'll be going away tomorrow.

1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:22.120
I'm leaving this place.

1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:32.560
If you're ever in trouble,

1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:35.120
I want you to contact me.

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:42.080
Please don't hesitate.

1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:37.920
Morning.

1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:40.480
You're only here for one reason.

1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:43.880
You alone can identify him.

1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:46.200
Apparently, you still can't
do anything

1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:48.360
without your sidekick, Liebermann.

1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:00.000
What time do the delegates arrive?

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:03.280
Austrians at nine,
Russians at noon.

1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:22.400
History is going to be made
around this table today,

1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:24.880
one way or another.

1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:27.600
The perimeter wall is manned.

1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:30.280
It doesn't matter, Max.

1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:33.040
He'll find a way to get in, somehow.

1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:51.920
Papers.

1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:14.480
Who is he, Max?

1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:16.640
You still haven't told me.

1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:20.280
I can't see him clearly, Oskar.

1:17:20.280 --> 1:17:23.000
Too many things about him
don't make sense.

1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:24.240
Such as?

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:25.640
Well, he makes a statement,

1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:28.240
killing that agent in such
a sadistic manner.

1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:30.880
Cutting out his tongue,
severing his hand. Like I said,

1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:33.160
it was almost a piece of theatre.

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:39.560
But then, how exactly did Kiss know
the body would be discovered?

1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:43.960
If you want to publish
a warning to the world,

1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:46.040
why hide it in a slum-house?

1:18:03.800 --> 1:18:07.280
And then there's the informant
we never found.

1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:10.200
And the guns and ammunition hidden
under the floorboards.

1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:12.080
He goes to all that
trouble to hide them

1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:14.600
and then leaves the nails
sitting in a wine glass.

1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:17.200
It's as if he wants
the hounds on his tail.

1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:25.000
Lily.

1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:26.280
What?

1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:30.880
The girl, the pickpocket
who stumbled on the corpse.

1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:32.600
What about her?

1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:34.480
She's the key to this.

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:35.680
What?!Think about it.

1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:37.640
She's the reason
all of this happened.

1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:41.560
She led the police to the body.
Yes. It was an accident.

1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:43.920
There are no accidents.
Not in this game.

1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:49.480
Anton Resch had been rotting
in that hovel for weeks

1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:51.080
and then miraculously he's found.

1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:53.400
It was a hunt and the girl
was the one who left the scent.

1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:54.960
She was the fox.
What are you saying?

1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:56.560
She was told to lead
the police there.

1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:58.040
That's ridiculous. By whom?Kiss.

1:18:58.040 --> 1:18:59.680
He doesn't leave anything to chance.

1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:01.800
My God, where's the girl now?

1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:03.400
She's still at my home.

1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:04.680
I need to get back there.

1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:27.720
I was wrong about you, wasn't I?

1:19:27.720 --> 1:19:30.520
From the very first moment.
Stupid, stupid.

1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:33.320
Max? What on earth has gotten into
you?I treated you like a patient,

1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:36.320
I expected you to be a victim hurt,
damaged, wounded.

1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:38.880
I wanted you to be something
that you're not.

1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:41.400
Max, leave her alone,
can't you see you're upsetting her?

1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:44.240
You ran into that house and you knew
exactly what you would find there.

1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:46.960
This behaviour isn't trauma,
it's guilt.

1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:53.000
He told you to do it, didn't he?

1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:54.400
Kiss.

1:19:54.400 --> 1:19:56.400
He told you to lead
the police to that slum.

1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:57.680
Why?

1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:01.320
If we hadn't kept you
under lock and key

1:20:01.320 --> 1:20:03.440
you'd be back by his side
right this minute.

1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:05.160
You'll never catch him.

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:13.160
The police.

1:20:17.720 --> 1:20:20.640
They weren't observing him
in that apartment.

1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:23.800
He was observing them.

1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:29.400
You led them to that
corpse to bait a trap.

1:20:29.400 --> 1:20:34.240
And Oskar was the one who fell in.

1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:37.160
He's followed Oskar to Laxenburg,
hasn't he?

1:20:38.880 --> 1:20:43.440
Tick tock, tick tock,

1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:50.840
tick tock, tick tock,
tick tock,

1:20:50.840 --> 1:20:55.080
tick tock, tick tock...

1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:01.840
He's here. He knows.
Kiss?

1:21:01.840 --> 1:21:04.640
He needed someone to lead him
to this rendezvous.

1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:07.640
He needed a date and a location.
He's been following you, Oskar.

1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:09.160
There was never an informant.

1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:10.520
It was all Kiss.

1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:11.760
The Feather, the Black Hand,

1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:13.840
he deliberately revealed
himself to you alone.

1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:16.080
He needed you to be brought here
so that he could follow.

1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:19.760
Oskar, he's planted
a bomb somewhere.

1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:21.400
A bomb?

1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:11.080
Oskar, the Russians will be
here any minute.

1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:13.440
Damn it.

1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:37.320
There are officers on the boundary.

1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:38.640
Yes.

1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:41.120
There's no way that anyone
else would be permitted inside.

1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:42.640
No, of course not.

1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:45.000
Except one of us.

1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:46.960
Except a police officer.

1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:49.360
My carriage wasn't
checked at the gates.

1:22:49.360 --> 1:22:50.640
No.

1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:51.960
The driver.

1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:16.240
Have you seen this painting?

1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:18.840
Our glorious victory
against the Turks.

1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:26.440
Sir, may I introduce to you,
His Excellency Losenstein,

1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:28.640
Count Schwarz.

1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:37.880
Be seated.

1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:48.240
It was here. It was in the carriage.

1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:51.680
Oskar,
we brought the bomb to the castle.

1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:53.480
The driver, did you see him?

1:23:53.480 --> 1:23:56.000
Yes, he went upstairs,
with a crate of wine.

1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:57.280
Upstairs, where?

1:23:57.280 --> 1:23:58.880
To the dining room.

1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:02.360
Gentlemen,

1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:07.480
this historic signature signals
a symbol of trust between us.

1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:10.640
What's going on?

1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:11.920
Rheinhardt.

1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:13.080
What's the matter?

1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:15.000
Sorry to disturb, sir,

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:16.840
but there's a bomb.

1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:19.320
A bomb?

1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:25.000
A bomb. A bomb! Get out of here!

1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.560
Now!

1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:28.120
Get out!

1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:30.480
And you solve this.

1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:32.080
Get out. Get out.

1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:33.720
Hurry.

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:39.240
Max, you hear that?

1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:41.480
TICKING

1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:43.240
Oskar!

1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:50.120
Hmm.

1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:57.320
Take it.

1:24:57.320 --> 1:24:59.160
I don't know what I'm doing.

1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:00.480
Carefully.

1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:29.760
The wire, pull it out.

1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:31.760
That's your suggestion?

1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:34.160
I'm not a bomb expert.

1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:36.160
No, clearly.

1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:42.400
Max, where are you going?

1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:44.280
There's no time!

1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:45.560
Max.

1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:48.640
Alarm, alarm!

1:26:14.920 --> 1:26:16.920
This is so embarrassing.

1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:18.320
Indeed.

1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:21.720
I really do apologise.

1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:53.320
It was all a charade, Max.

1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:56.800
Kiss controlled everything.

1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:00.440
You were right, he was watching me.

1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:03.680
Feeding me clues.

1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:07.800
There were two of them.

1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:10.720
Two actors.

1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:12.720
Kiss and his accomplice.

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:19.600
All the time she was listening.

1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:25.000
They're laughing at us, Max.

1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:28.680
She's laughing at me.

1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:33.440
The devil won't be caught
a second time.

1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:36.280
We'll see.

1:27:54.200 --> 1:27:55.520
She came home.

1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:16.040
A writer once said,

1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:20.160
"If the devil did not exist
then man would create him

1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:23.040
"in his own image and likeness."

1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:27.440
We look at people all around us yet
we don't see them for what they are.

1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:30.360
We see instead what
we want them to be.

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:33.840
A projection of our own needs
and desires.
