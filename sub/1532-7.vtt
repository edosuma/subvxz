00:02.320 --> 00:04.482
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:04.640 --> 00:06.290
After five years in hell...

00:06.480 --> 00:08.369
...I have come home with only one goal:

00:08.520 --> 00:10.443
To save my city.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.568
Now others have joined my crusade.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.802
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.282
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.683
I am something else.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.763
Previously on Arrow:

00:23.960 --> 00:26.691
I killed him. The police officer.
Why didn't you tell me?

00:26.880 --> 00:29.406
You were overdosed on Mirakuru.
You didn't remember.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.210
I was hoping that you never would.

00:31.360 --> 00:35.763
This city still needs saving,
and that is my vision for this company.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.445
Yes, I am your boss now.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.722
I can quit, which is what I just did.

00:39.880 --> 00:43.123
I thought that I could be me and the Arrow,
but I can't.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.009
Say it'll never work out between us.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.288
- Say you never loved me, say...
- Felicity.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.802
I told you as soon as we talked,
it would be over.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.362
- What changed your mind?
- I just decided I want more out of life.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.847
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Cupid, stupid.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.050
In the last five minutes,
S.C.P.D. has had over 200 reports...

01:09.200 --> 01:11.009
...of masked men attacking the city.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.242
- There's 3.8 miles to the bridge.
- And a dozen Mirakuru soldiers.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.607
- Stop.
- Stop? Here? We're already late.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.205
Stop.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.603
Everybody, get back inside.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.209
Isaac Stanzler.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.922
The two of you got the
same taste in outfits.

02:19.080 --> 02:22.163
- Thought he was in custody.
- Yeah.

02:23.280 --> 02:27.922
Corrections was transporting him
to Iron Heights when he got pincushioned.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.851
- By who?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

02:31.040 --> 02:35.250
But whoever it was went to a lot of trouble,
dressing him up and dumping him like this.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.846
Our doer is definitely trying
to get your attention.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.207
Well, he's got it. Any leads yet?

02:40.360 --> 02:44.251
No, only physical evidence
other than the body is this.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.767
It's shaped like a spade.
What's that all about?

02:47.920 --> 02:49.126
I don't know.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.125
I'll look into it.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.163
I'm not your mother, or your wife.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.885
- Or your maid.
- Okay. All right.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.929
You don't like me. I get it.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.687
- At least you're perceptive.
- I thought that in the last week...

03:06.840 --> 03:10.970
...we did the whole candle meditation
thing, and maybe we had a moment.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.169
Moment's over. You can celebrate
by doing your own laundry.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.450
- Yeah.
- What?

03:17.600 --> 03:20.444
L... I don't know how.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.927
Where you going?

03:24.080 --> 03:25.809
Waller just called.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.931
New intel on this Li Kuan Hui
the Triad's interested in.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.481
- What?
- My contact is down at the docks.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.847
A gaijin would stick out
like neon down there.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.250
- Gaijin?
- It'll be fine.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.644
I'll only be gone an hour.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.290
What am I supposed to do?

03:43.680 --> 03:46.160
Your laundry, apparently.

03:56.600 --> 04:01.766
What are you doing? We were supposed to be
at the press conference 20 minutes ago.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.561
Oh, God, I have a type.

04:05.760 --> 04:10.129
Richard Branson works out twice a day. Gives him
20 additional hours of productivity a week.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.329
I'm sorry, I can't hear a word
you're saying when you're doing...

04:13.520 --> 04:14.851
...that.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.845
- Sorry. What's up?
- The announcement?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.482
There's a gajillion reporters
and city notables waiting for you.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.366
Oh, ha. Well, this'll be interesting. Ha.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.128
BTW, are you free
for dinner tomorrow night?

04:30.840 --> 04:32.649
- What?
- I have a dinner with the CEO...

04:32.800 --> 04:34.325
...of a Nevada mining concern.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.686
They own mineral rights...

04:35.840 --> 04:39.162
...imperative to the cogeneration project.
And I fit into this how?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.368
The CEO is boring.
His wife, even more boring.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.967
If I go solo, I'll end up slicing
my wrist open with a butter knife.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.363
Well, I don't think a butter knife
is gonna do the job.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.927
Oh. There will be steak knives there too.
Dangerous.

04:53.080 --> 04:57.130
I'm sure you have a dozen other employees
better suited as your anti-boring wing-woman.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.968
Hundreds, actually.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.202
But you are the one I
bought this dress for.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.330
This dress...

05:06.080 --> 05:07.730
...costs more than my apartment.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.803
Yeah, it's couture.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.486
Which I'm pretty sure is French
for "expensive."

05:15.320 --> 05:17.243
- Oh.
- So dinner?

05:17.800 --> 05:19.290
Purely platonic.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.487
There is nothing platonic about couture.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.761
Fine, I'll have my assistant return it.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.082
No... All right, I'll go, I'll go.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.847
- But only so I can wear this dress.
- Of course.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.281
You and I are gonna be best friends.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.887
- Hey.
- Last time I saw a spade that lethal...

05:40.040 --> 05:42.441
...it cut up a pretty good royal flush
I was holding.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.241
- Hand-soldered out of high-carbon steel.
- Where'd you find it?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.004
Isaac Stanzler's chest.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.929
Ted Grant's psycho sidekick?

05:51.120 --> 05:53.646
Was murdered while being transferred
by the S.C.P.D.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.245
By an arrow.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.767
- Think this is the same archer that killed Sara?
- No.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.405
MO is different.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.530
These bodies were staged.
Dressed up to look like...

06:02.680 --> 06:06.765
Copycat archer. Guess all that positive
publicity you've been getting has a downside.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.968
Whatever the reason, we need to find him.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.723
I would like Felicity
to do a workup on all of this ASAP.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.564
COPY-

06:18.320 --> 06:21.927
- I think Felicity's a little busy right now.
- Doing what?

06:22.080 --> 06:25.641
A few months ago, I made a promise
to help revitalize Starling City.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.640
But I knew I couldn't do it alone.
I needed help.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.566
A lot of help.

06:30.720 --> 06:35.248
From people who are even more intelligent
and dedicated than I am.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.210
All of us are working very hard
with one goal in mind:

06:38.360 --> 06:40.442
To save our city.

06:40.600 --> 06:45.322
But to do so, Queen Consolidated
needs to be something else.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.845
You Okay?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.764
I'm fine.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.250
You don't seem fine.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.011
What is this?

07:16.200 --> 07:19.682
- What's that? A note?
- It's an address.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.968
15 Baron Street.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.246
Apartment 7.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.723
Nobody's home.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.168
These are all articles about the Arrow.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.607
This isn't just a copycat. This is a fan.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.730
And from the looks of it,
a pretty dedicated one.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.924
And this isn't a spade.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.571
It's a heart.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.324
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.686
Did you like your present?

08:17.840 --> 08:21.322
Do you mean Isaac Stanzler,
the man you killed?

08:21.520 --> 08:23.682
I see the way you take care of your city.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.888
Makes me wonder...

08:26.800 --> 08:28.689
...who takes care of you?

08:29.080 --> 08:30.809
I wanna help you.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.371
To fight with you.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.886
To kill for you.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.850
Mr. Stanzler was just the first.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.046
He might be the second.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.925
I thought we could punish
this one together.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.404
- I'm gonna find you.
- Well, that's the idea.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.329
But you'd better hurry.
I don't think he's got very long.

09:15.720 --> 09:16.926
Roy.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.810
I was just researching cheap booze
for Thea's club.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.481
You know, it wasn't you
who killed that officer.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.291
I keep telling myself that,
but it's not working.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.090
Every single time I put on that mask,
I feel like a fraud.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.810
You...

09:32.960 --> 09:34.530
You have to give this time.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.123
- If you wanna talk about it...
- I don't.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.089
I appreciate the offer, though.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.164
But I'm fine, really.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.051
- Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?
- I was just leaving.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.044
I gotta help Thea get the club ready
for the opening.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.360
What's up?

09:52.520 --> 09:57.128
I got an ID on your "not so secret
but very crazy" admirer's hostage.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.209
- Who is it?
- Joe Gravano, local mob boss.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.727
Wanted for 39 murders,
racketeering, drug smuggling.

10:01.880 --> 10:05.487
- One of the most protected men in the city.
- Not anymore.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.689
- What's NPP?
- I don't know.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.089
But I can definitely find out.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.288
And the cell phone from her apartment?

10:14.440 --> 10:17.523
Crazypants encrypted the SIM.
I can crack it, but it'll take time.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.486
Which we don't have. Neither does he.
I need all your focus on finding Gravano.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.729
And I will work around the clock on it,
except for tonight.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.360
- Why?
- Ray Palmer invited me to dinner.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.607
Oh.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.967
Not "dinner" dinner, like a date.
A work dinner.

10:31.120 --> 10:36.047
But since dinner is a meal you can technically
only eat at night, I need the night off.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.085
That okay?

10:43.360 --> 10:45.089
Do what you want.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.731
Nothing?

11:00.760 --> 11:03.969
- He's not answering his cell.
- Just relax.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.363
- I'm sure he's fine.
- He said it would only be an hour.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.722
That was nine hours ago.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.930
If he's going to be late, he always calls.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.845
He said his contact
was down at the docks, right?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.002
I will go down and check it out.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.525
No, I'll go.

11:23.480 --> 11:27.565
No offense, but you're just Mase0's wife.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.482
And you're just a billionaire...

11:31.640 --> 11:34.211
...who doesn't know how to use
a laundry machine.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.211
Do you have someone who
could watch Akio for a few hours?

11:50.520 --> 11:53.683
Great. Uh, thank you. You were terrific.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.650
Auditions are over.
Thanks for coming, guys.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.926
Hey, peace out.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.163
Wait, what are you doing?
Auditions are not over.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.761
Trust me, I'm saving you
from wasting your day here.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.763
I don't need saving from anyone.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.241
And if you're really as good
as you say you are...

12:09.400 --> 12:12.131
...you can wait in line and prove it,
like everyone else.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.408
- I don't audition.
- Then you don't work.

12:14.560 --> 12:18.849
For me or for my club.
So the exit's that way.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.049
Later, princess.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.971
I got her. The user registered
to the encrypted SIM card.

12:31.120 --> 12:35.284
Carrie Cutter. She's former S.C.P.D.
She was the first woman SWAT team member.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.605
I've seen her before.

12:37.760 --> 12:41.287
She's not unpretty for a wacko,
if you're into the red-headed vixen type.

12:41.440 --> 12:45.764
- She was police. That's why she looks familiar.
- No, she left the force before you got back.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.810
But there's another very good reason
she looks familiar.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.611
Why was she at the crime scene
at Ted Grant's gym?

12:51.760 --> 12:53.569
I don't know, but it's not just there.

12:56.640 --> 13:01.043
Apparently stalking isn't her only hobby either.
She's a member of a gardening group too.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.204
- Which explains the whole NPP thing.
- What NPP thing?

13:04.360 --> 13:07.091
The bag in the Gravano hostage photo.
NPP is an acronym.

13:07.240 --> 13:11.370
Stands for "nitrogen, phosphate, potash."
It's the chemical formula for fertilizer.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.601
So, what if she's keeping Gravano
in a greenhouse?

13:15.760 --> 13:16.966
Yeah.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.569
The closest one to her apartment
is Sherwood Florist, 7884 Hauser.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.371
- Have Roy gear up and meet me there.
- Okay.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.645
Roy.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.569
- Find Gravano. I'll take care of Cutter.
- Got it.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.768
Arsenal, there's no sign of Cutter.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.530
Arsenal?

14:04.880 --> 14:06.041
Arsenal.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.565
Hello, lover.

14:10.080 --> 14:14.130
- If you hurt him...
- I didn't touch him, boyfriend.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.886
I'm a one-guy woman.

14:17.360 --> 14:20.170
But I am a little disappointed
you brought your wingman.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.608
Tonight's not about him. It's about us.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.330
Together against the world.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.729
Just like we were meant to be.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.803
There is no "we."

14:29.960 --> 14:32.088
We're more like one soul. You're right.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.447
You and I are more alike than you think.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.962
Carrie, listen to me. You're not well.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.481
If I'm out of my mind,
it's because that's what love is.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.927
Our own little slice of insanity.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.050
Make a wish.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.768
Mine's already come true.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.925
For the two of us to be together forever.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.003
Help me. Don't leave me with this psycho.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.810
- Quiet!
- You don't wanna do this.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.086
Sure I do.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.891
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

15:13.400 --> 15:18.611
That rope's laced with a trip wire hooked
up to a thing on his chest that goes boom.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.445
- So, what do you want, then?
- Not much.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.684
Just you.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.365
Never gonna happen.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.761
Such a party POOPQT-

15:43.640 --> 15:46.120
Never thought I'd be happy to see you.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.366
Roy, hey!

15:56.720 --> 15:58.882
You should go home, man.
It's been a long night.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.202
She took me out.
That shouldn't have happened.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.762
You... You're not at your best.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.160
I'm fine.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.402
You weren't the only person Carrie stalked.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.803
She was put on limited duty
after becoming obsessed with her partner.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.645
The department sent her
to St. Walker's for a psych eval.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.723
She quit the force a little bit after.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.201
- Where's Felicity?
- She's working tonight.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.284
- She said she told you.
- Yes, she did.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.363
Oliver, you okay?

16:31.520 --> 16:35.047
I know this can't be easy with Felicity
spending so much time with Palmer.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.690
I'm fine.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.923
- Where you going?
- The psychiatrist that S.C.P.D. sent Cutter to.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.526
- You need backup?
- No, I've got it.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.766
Hey. Like what you've done to the place.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.049
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, I was just in the neighborhood.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.965
- Thought I'd stop by, check out your new sign.
- Oh, yeah.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.083
Well, that's a nice dress.

17:14.240 --> 17:18.689
Yeah, it's really, really, really nice.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.965
Ray lent it to me for a work dinner.

17:22.119 --> 17:27.126
- Yeah, this work dinner with you and Ray...
- Mm-hm.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.328
...doesn't seem that platonic.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.126
Actually, it has Oliver
twisted up in knots.

17:33.080 --> 17:37.483
- Well, Oliver made his choice.
- And we both know that was the wrong choice.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.404
Did Oliver say that?

17:39.560 --> 17:42.450
Yeah, because Oliver's just great
at expressing his emotions.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.366
He would rather go 1 O rounds with
the League of Assassins than ever say that.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.966
But this thing with you and Palmer, it's...

17:49.120 --> 17:53.523
It's messing with his head,
Felicity, and that's really dangerous.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.002
I told you, there is no me and Palmer.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.403
But if there were,
and if Oliver had a problem with it...

18:00.560 --> 18:03.609
...then Oliver should be the one
to say something.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.725
Okay.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.126
Good night.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.404
- Dr. Pressnall...
- Oh, my God.

18:25.560 --> 18:26.891
I'm not here to hurt you.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.242
- What do you want?
- To talk about Carrie Cutter.

18:30.160 --> 18:34.165
I can't. Doctor-patient privilege.
Just, please, get out.

18:34.320 --> 18:38.644
Your patient killed a man, kidnapped
another, and I'm trying to stop her...

18:38.840 --> 18:40.410
...before she hurts anyone else.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.245
But to do that, I need to understand her.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.571
Please.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.282
I can only diagnose her.

18:51.880 --> 18:57.603
Attachment disorder. The inability
to form real, lasting relationships.

18:57.760 --> 19:03.005
They push everyone away
and fixate on a single person.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.362
Someone they feel mirrors
their emotional state.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.646
How do I stop her?

19:08.840 --> 19:11.366
Give her the connection that she craves.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.887
Honesty, sincerity...

19:15.040 --> 19:18.362
If you lie to her, she'll know.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.284
Thank you.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.527
If you'll permit a
professional observation...

19:25.880 --> 19:29.521
...you could use a little therapy yourself.
What gives you that impression?

19:29.680 --> 19:33.321
You mean apart from the mask
and the Robin Hood costume?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.765
Shouldn't we get out and look around or...?

19:46.920 --> 19:48.524
I don't... Something?

19:48.680 --> 19:51.206
In this place? At this hour?

19:51.360 --> 19:53.806
That's a very efficient way
to get yourself killed.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.441
- Feel free.
- Heh.

19:57.720 --> 20:00.451
Thank you, that's... We'll wait, then.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.885
Gaijin.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.285
What?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.647
Maseo called me that before he left...

20:09.800 --> 20:12.690
...and I looked it up,
but it wasn't in my Chinese dictionary.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.002
Because it's Japanese.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.091
It means foreigner.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.365
Outsider.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.128
- You.
- It means you too.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.688
You're Japanese living in Hong Kong.

20:31.680 --> 20:32.966
Sorry.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.008
Why did you leave Japan?

20:40.880 --> 20:44.362
- It wasn't safe for us there.
- Why?

20:47.160 --> 20:51.688
We upset some very powerful,
very dangerous men.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.205
Who?

20:54.680 --> 20:58.685
- You ask a lot of questions.
- That's what your husband says.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.129
Who's that?

21:02.800 --> 21:06.850
Shu Gang, rivals of the Triad.
They control this port.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.761
So they know what happened to Maseo?

21:10.360 --> 21:11.407
I don't know.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.845
Only one way to find out.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.965
Hey, I don't want any trouble.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.844
What happened to the thing?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.331
Wow.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.801
You are ridiculous.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.691
_Um__
Which I mean in a good way.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.289
That's not creepy.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.525
- You look beautiful.
- Oh. I think it's the dress. Heh.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.524
- Dress is actually missing something.
- Oh, no.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.923
I forgot to do up the zipper again.
I always do that.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.849
Oh, no, I can't wear that.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.367
I'm not even sure
I'm supposed to be looking at it.

22:08.880 --> 22:12.930
Well, I had to put down a $10,000 security
deposit just to borrow it for the evening...

22:13.080 --> 22:16.926
...so one of us should wear it,
and diamonds aren't really my thing, so...

22:17.080 --> 22:22.246
I appreciate it, but I think I would feel
strange wearing a million-dollar necklace.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.771
Oh, don't worry.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.968
It's not worth a million dollars.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.204
Ah...

22:30.960 --> 22:36.524
Think it was actually appraised
for 10 million dollars, so...

22:38.800 --> 22:41.531
There you go. That's better.

22:43.880 --> 22:47.680
Where you been?
You don't call, you don't write.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.042
I've been busy, busy, busy.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.965
You look good.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.086
Business before pleasure.

23:00.760 --> 23:04.685
First I located every crime scene the Arrow's
been spotted at in the past six months.

23:05.240 --> 23:09.165
Now the magic part. I created an algorithm
calculating the average amount of time...

23:09.360 --> 23:14.924
...it takes the Arrow to reach a crime scene,
triangulated that by the distance to said scene.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.367
Genius, right? I know,
no one had thought to do it before.

23:21.520 --> 23:25.127
Now, obviously I can't pinpoint
the exact block...

23:25.280 --> 23:30.161
...but there's no doubt your guy hangs his
hat, or his hoodie, somewhere in this area.

23:30.320 --> 23:34.245
- And you're sure about this?
- Statistical correlations do not lie.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.165
Now...

23:38.520 --> 23:40.170
...what was this about pleasure?

23:50.520 --> 23:52.921
I'm sorry.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.686
I'm spoken for.

24:07.120 --> 24:10.090
- How'd it go with Cutter's shrink?
- Whew.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.004
There's a reason I'm not in therapy.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.091
Yo.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.648
- Detective.
- Your new girlfriend...

24:17.800 --> 24:21.691
...just put another heart-shaped arrow
in the neck of one of her old Cl's.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.491
- Who was he?
- Kirby Bates.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.565
Some kind of computer expert.
Holed up in a flophouse north of Amsterdam.

24:28.720 --> 24:32.611
Did a five-year bit in Iron Heights. Stole
a couple million credit-card PIN numbers.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.240
- What did Bates do for her?
- I don't know.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.967
Everything here is smashed to pieces.

24:38.160 --> 24:42.085
But smart money says whatever Cutter's
planning next, you're not gonna like it.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.049
Thanks, detective.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.084
- We need Felicity here.
- Oliver, she's still at dinner with...

24:48.240 --> 24:50.402
I don't care where she is.
We need her here.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.769
- You need her to be any place Ray Palmer isn't.
- It's not the time.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.287
You're in the field
without your head on straight.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.841
- This is exactly the time.
- I've got it handled.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.809
Doesn't look that way to me.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.088
What do you want me to say?

25:03.800 --> 25:07.771
Yes, it bothers me that she is
out to dinner with Palmer.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.561
Yes, it bothers me that apparently
she is just moving on with her life.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.964
But I made a decision.
She did too. And all...

25:19.680 --> 25:21.682
I just... I want her to be happy.

25:21.840 --> 25:25.128
If that were true, you'd be with her, man.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.768
- Where you going?
- Flophouse on Amsterdam.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.009
- They're long gone by now.
- Maybe she didn't get that far.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.888
I'm here looking for my husband.

25:52.040 --> 25:55.249
Thin beard. Long hair. Japanese.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.289
Don't know any Japanese. Uhn.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.965
TW again.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.606
- I don't know anything.
- A.R.G.U.S.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.649
Does that mean something to you?

26:03.800 --> 26:06.326
I don't know anything.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.371
Except...

26:09.840 --> 26:12.411
Three men. This A.R.G.U.S.
They work for them.

26:12.560 --> 26:13.925
Worked.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.480
What do you mean?

26:18.600 --> 26:20.364
They're all dead.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.205
Killed by Triad a few hours ago.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.840
- Ah. Mr. Gardner, Ray Palmer.
- Good.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.527
Mrs. Gardner. This is Felicity Smoak,
vice president of Palmer Technologies.

26:39.680 --> 26:40.727
- Hell0.
- Pleasure.

26:40.880 --> 26:44.680
- Thank you for sitting down with us.
- Well, I'm always happy to enjoy a good meal.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.525
And I'm very impressed
with your background.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.287
But I have no plans
of selling my Nevada holding.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.010
The night is still young.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.481
Shall we sit down? We have a lotto discuss.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.891
- Thank you.
- As you said, the night is young.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.284
But I don't like to talk business
until at least the entree.

27:27.120 --> 27:30.408
Maybe the DJ got confused
and thinks he's at a rave.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.166
I think my ears are bleeding.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.368
Excuse me? I'm sorry.

27:38.840 --> 27:39.887
You're fired.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.089
- What about the rest of the night?
- I think my Spotify playlist...

27:43.240 --> 27:45.766
...is a better option than you right now.
Whatever.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.765
You need some help?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.048
I thought the night couldn't get any worse.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.568
Thought I'd swing by,
see what kind of train wreck this would be.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.087
Did I say train wreck? Because this is...

28:00.720 --> 28:02.768
You know, I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.321
Yeah, think I'm the only one.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.644
Yeah, I just remembered. I own a bar.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.284
Half the gate and guaranteed gigs
four times a week.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.966
- Two times a week.
- Three.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.443
Fine, just get these people dancing.

28:36.120 --> 28:39.647
Obviously the progeneration of certain
minerals can't be accounted for...

28:39.800 --> 28:41.404
...by simple elemental cohesion.

28:41.560 --> 28:45.485
I am so sorry.
I had to help a coworker with a thing.

28:45.640 --> 28:49.406
- I had to have them take the steak knives away.
- I'm sorry.

28:49.560 --> 28:54.168
Mr. Gardner, did Ray get to tell you about his
plans for your mineral deposits in Nevada?

28:54.320 --> 28:57.722
No, Ms. Smoak. As I mentioned,
I'm not interested in selling.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.526
Please, call me Felicity.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.604
And I don't blame you
for not wanting to sell Ray your mine.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.527
Because you don't know what his plans are.

29:09.280 --> 29:14.241
I mean, the thing about Ray is
he's not a businessman.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.770
Businessmen make deals.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.524
They make money.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.409
What Ray is...

29:22.640 --> 29:24.005
...is something else entirely.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.368
Perhaps you can enlighten us.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.567
He inspires.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.091
Ray isn't interested in making money.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.131
He's interested in
making the world a better place.

29:38.120 --> 29:41.442
So if Ray wants your mine...

29:42.640 --> 29:46.281
...believe me, it's because he's going to
put it to the kind of use...

29:46.440 --> 29:48.124
...that's gonna make you proud.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.083
- Yeah.
- I spoke with Felicity-

29:57.240 --> 29:59.527
I got her to remote-access that laptop.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.967
The last thing Cutter was looking at
was a map.

30:02.120 --> 30:05.044
And, Oliver, Verdant was marked on it.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.483
Felicity also retrieved
Cutter's phone signal from the laptop.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.087
Patch me through, then get upstairs
and do not take your eyes off of Thea.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.561
- Do you understand?
- Copy that.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.922
Turn down for what

30:27.480 --> 30:29.801
One Cupid's kiss.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.408
Turn down for what

30:35.360 --> 30:36.521
Delicious.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.931
- Hello?
- It's me.

30:45.080 --> 30:50.041
I have to admit, I didn't think a club
would be your kind of scene.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.130
You're always surprising me.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.760
- I'm not there.
- Why don't I believe you?

30:55.920 --> 31:00.369
You wanna meet me? Fine.
I will meet you anywhere but that club.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.204
So you're asking me out?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.169
Where do you wanna meet, Carrie?

31:04.320 --> 31:05.810
I know a place.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.042
Our special spot.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.202
But you listen to me, lover.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.089
I've been burned before.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.890
And if you're playing me...

31:15.040 --> 31:18.249
...I promise you I'll come back here
and kill everyone in this place.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.441
Digg, you there?

31:34.960 --> 31:36.928
And me. "Me" being Felicity.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.168
- What's your 20?
- Subway stop downtown.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.402
Why did Cutter have you meet her there?

31:49.200 --> 31:51.202
Because this is where I saved her.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.926
- Hello, lover.
- I'm not your lover.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.721
Well, maybe not yet.

32:00.880 --> 32:04.805
But after one night with me,
that'll all change, I promise.

32:04.960 --> 32:08.043
Carrie, I'm here to help you
because you're not well.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.489
Don't ever say that again.

32:10.640 --> 32:13.371
You sound like that shrink
that they sent me to.

32:13.520 --> 32:14.567
I spoke to her.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.845
You talked to that psycho.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.607
She just wanted me to
take pills, pills, pills.

32:21.760 --> 32:25.321
She thinks that love is a disease.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.050
But it's not.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.483
Love is the cure.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.041
I am not the man you think I am.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.529
You're a hero.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.881
You saved me.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.650
I understand that you're hurting...

32:44.360 --> 32:47.603
...and I know what it's like
to want someone...

32:48.560 --> 32:50.881
...but not be able to be with them.

32:51.040 --> 32:54.487
How you wish things could be different,
but they can't.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.802
I can't be with you.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.325
I can't be with anyone.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.849
I have to be alone.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.405
No, you don't.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.524
You're a liar.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.009
I don't wanna hurt you.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.685
You already have.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.204
It's over, Carrie.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.962
I guess it's true what they say.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.327
You only hurt the ones you love.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.209
Oliver. Get him back. Oliver.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.324
Sorry.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.880
- But if I can't have you...
- Carrie, think about this.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.522
I didn't want it to end this way.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.771
I guess I don't handle rejection very well.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.159
You don't have to do this.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.286
I do.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.603
But at least this way...

34:30.760 --> 34:35.004
...we can be together for eternity.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.324
Aah!

34:52.960 --> 34:54.610
I knew you loved me.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.724
It's done.

35:03.880 --> 35:08.681
Lyla said Cutter's even nuttier than the
last woman they had in the Suicide Squad.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.481
Sure it was a good idea
handing her over to Waller?

35:11.640 --> 35:13.927
Iron Heights isn't right for her.

35:14.440 --> 35:18.411
Least on the Squad
she can make a difference.

35:21.880 --> 35:24.850
Lyla is preparing a late dinner,
if you wanna join.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.322
No, I'm good. Thank you.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.364
Listen, Oliver.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.562
Felicity heard what you said to Cutter.

35:33.720 --> 35:34.881
About being alone.

35:36.440 --> 35:40.001
If her reaction was any indication,
she does not wanna be.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.649
You gotta tell her how you feel
before it's too late.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.884
It's just food for thought.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.887
What do I tell him?

36:04.200 --> 36:06.521
How do I tell my son his father is dead?

36:16.360 --> 36:17.964
Where have you two been?

36:23.760 --> 36:24.886
What's going on?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.764
You're home.

36:27.920 --> 36:31.766
- I was so worried.
- I know. I'm sorry. I should have called.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.287
Waller changed my orders
and brought me in.

36:34.440 --> 36:37.569
We were on lockdown tonight
because three agents got killed.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.530
Gross.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.965
Akio, get over here.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.845
Pretty good gate tonight.

37:11.720 --> 37:16.487
- You're never gonna let me forget this, are you?
- You have to admit, I did save your ass.

37:16.640 --> 37:20.486
God, your modesty, it's so refreshing.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.484
You know, you're really cute
when you're sarcastic.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.930
Half the gate, as agreed.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.170
Keep the money.
My grand re-opening gift to you.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.882
I'll see you next week.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.568
Aha. Thought I might find you here.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.451
I'm getting a jump on that
server encryption you asked for.

37:54.600 --> 37:58.207
Trying to, you know,
make up for ruining the deal tonight.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.931
Your definition of ruin
is vastly different from mine.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.205
Gardners are gonna sell.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.011
- That's amazing.
- It's all thanks to you.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.486
L-leh-

38:09.280 --> 38:12.443
But really, I should be thanking you.

38:13.680 --> 38:17.765
I mean, not just for the new job,
but for this amazing, expensive necklace.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.404
You have to take it back, don't you?

38:22.560 --> 38:24.130
- Yeah, I kind of do.
- Yeah.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.046
Here, let me help you.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.689
Mm. Thank you.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.489
You know, Felicity Smoak...

38:32.640 --> 38:35.041
...you're different from
anyone I've ever met.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.721
- Hm.
- You deserve all those things.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.450
And more.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.728
I'm... I'm sorry.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.890
I meant to keep tonight platonic. Uh...

39:04.200 --> 39:06.202
- I should go.
- Ray...?

39:08.280 --> 39:09.770
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.564
Okay.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.965
Are you okay?

39:34.880 --> 39:36.245
Not really.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.205
What about you?

39:40.720 --> 39:41.846
Not really.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.645
Come on.

39:45.360 --> 39:46.725
Where are we going?

39:46.880 --> 39:48.848
For something we both need.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.125
Hi.

39:55.720 --> 39:59.088
- I know it's late, but...
- That was the invitation.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.765
Something smells good.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.844
- Thank you. Hi.
- Hi.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.126
- Come on in.
- Hi.

40:14.040 --> 40:18.011
Yup, I sent the notarized transfer
of ownership to Gardner's attorney.

40:18.160 --> 40:21.403
And listen, I wanna get a jump
on the mining operations immediately.

40:21.600 --> 40:25.525
Let me know as soon as the first
of the dwarf star alloy is extracted.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.091
Excellent.

41:17.880 --> 41:21.089
Whoever you are, back off.

41:25.360 --> 41:30.366
Sorry to do this to you,
but you have something I need.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.687
See, that's the thing about our work.

41:46.600 --> 41:51.208
It always comes back to haunt you.
