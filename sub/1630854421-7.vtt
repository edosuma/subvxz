00:07.173 --> 00:08.299
- My father was murdered.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.843
[dramatic music]

00:09.884 --> 00:10.844
[gasps]

00:10.885 --> 00:12.345
- Tell me you got sleep.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.972
- I think a parent
planted the bomb.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.056
- Who's your suspect?

00:15.098 --> 00:16.391
- Elisabeth Serra.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.434
Her husband Paul
was the one who told

00:17.475 --> 00:18.476
Janine the bomb was fake.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.728
- My money is on the Holts.

00:19.769 --> 00:21.146
Brad took a drive
this morning.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.063
You're never gonna guess
where he decided

00:22.105 --> 00:23.481
to pull over and rest.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.275
- Hey, captain,
we might have a problem.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.068
- [screams]
- What the hell, man?

00:27.110 --> 00:28.403
- Marcie might have
something to say

00:28.445 --> 00:29.988
about her husband's
infidelity.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.365
Question is whether she knows
who he's having it with.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.366
- Can I help you?

00:33.408 --> 00:34.784
- John Wentworth.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.745
What makes you think
I need your help?

00:36.786 --> 00:37.954
- Did you find Elisabeth?

00:37.996 --> 00:39.539
- Oh, now we can agree
that she's missing?

00:39.581 --> 00:40.832
- Mind if we make this quick?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.084
There's a 5K bonus in it
if I get done by Friday.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.794
- It seems that the Serras

00:44.836 --> 00:46.296
had serious
financial problems.

00:46.338 --> 00:47.380
- Where was the money going?

00:47.422 --> 00:48.715
- Some kind of crypto play.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.342
- It means we have
more than one case--

00:50.383 --> 00:52.177
the bombing
and Elisabeth's disappearance.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.220
- Elisabeth must have
turned heads.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.389
The most persistent
was Peter Hanney.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.183
- Hanney who owns
half of New York?

00:58.224 --> 00:59.934
- We were set to sail away
on my yacht.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.061
She didn't show.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.479
Haven't heard from her since.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.147
- She would never have
abandoned her sons.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.232
Elisabeth Serra isn't missing.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.233
She's dead.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.860
- Mom is coming home.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.487
My first dad is bringing her,

01:10.528 --> 01:12.614
and you're gonna have to leave.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.783
[blow lands]

[dramatic music]

01:21.331 --> 01:28.463
* *

02:20.515 --> 02:23.935
- Why are you still awake,
sweet boy?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.604
You have school tomorrow.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.149
Are you listening
to your teachers?

02:29.190 --> 02:30.900
- I love you, Mama.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.319
- And I love you, baby.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.988
[soft dramatic music]

02:35.030 --> 02:36.948
- Are you coming back?

02:36.990 --> 02:39.659
- I am never leaving again.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.161
I promise.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.329
* *

02:43.371 --> 02:45.832
Second dad is.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.793
[saw whirring]

02:50.503 --> 02:52.380
[machine slows]

02:52.422 --> 02:55.550
[phone ringing]

02:58.303 --> 02:59.346
- Hey, buddy.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.930
- When are you coming home?

03:00.972 --> 03:02.891
- Soon, honey, as soon
as I'm done working.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.435
- Dad, there's something
I want to tell you.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.812
- What's wrong?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.314
- I had a nightmare.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.193
- Oh, okay.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.569
You okay now?

03:14.611 --> 03:16.446
- Mm-hmm. I'm okay.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.656
- Okay. Your brother sleeping?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.158
- Yeah.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.451
- All right,
you go to bed too.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.286
I'll come in and give you
a kiss when I get there.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.329
I love you.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.373
- Love you too.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.291
[line disconnects]

03:28.333 --> 03:33.922
* *

03:33.963 --> 03:36.925
[monitor beeping]

03:44.182 --> 03:46.059
- First the bomb
at her daycare,

03:46.101 --> 03:47.769
then the threats, and now this?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.981
And I didn't do shit
but judge her.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.734
- It's possible
this was a random act.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.403
Every day now people
are being attacked

03:56.444 --> 03:57.487
in the city for no reason.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.697
- Oh, cut the shit, Avi.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.198
We both know that
this isn't random.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.825
This is connected
to the bomb threats.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.077
- We suspect it.
We don't know it.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.496
- Well, we both know that Anna
was holding something back,

04:06.538 --> 04:07.706
and I never believed
a word coming out

04:07.747 --> 04:09.874
of Brad Holt's mouth, did you?
- No.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.292
But at this point,
the facts support

04:11.334 --> 04:12.669
several interpretations.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.504
Holt and Anna lie to us. Why?

04:14.546 --> 04:16.339
Because they were trying

04:16.381 --> 04:17.549
to hide the affair
because they didn't want

04:17.590 --> 04:18.591
to destroy Holt's marriage.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.968
- Well, I don't blame them.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.845
I interviewed Mrs. Holt.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.849
Maybe she found out
about the affair before we did

04:25.890 --> 04:27.559
and she's the one
who attacked Anna.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.395
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.106
- Don't punish yourself.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.482
You aren't to blame.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.820
- So buddy,
can you tell me more

04:38.862 --> 04:42.615
about this nightmare
that you had?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.743
Was it about your mom?

04:44.784 --> 04:46.286
- But it wasn't a nightmare.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.121
She was here in the apartment.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.915
She was gonna surprise you,
but you got home too late

04:50.957 --> 04:52.584
and she had to leave.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.215
- Okay. I, um...

04:59.257 --> 05:00.467
guys, I probably should have

05:00.508 --> 05:01.968
talked to you about this
before.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.347
Eric, can you just look at me
for a second?

05:05.388 --> 05:07.974
Nothing is for certain,

05:08.016 --> 05:09.059
but there's a chance

05:09.100 --> 05:11.269
that Mom isn't coming home.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.687
- I know.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.652
- What else did she say?

05:20.445 --> 05:24.240
- She's with my first dad,
and she's really, really happy,

05:24.282 --> 05:26.159
just like she used to be here.

05:26.201 --> 05:30.538
* *

05:30.580 --> 05:33.541
- [exhales]

05:43.927 --> 05:45.553
- What's wrong?

05:46.721 --> 05:48.431
- You're my whole life.

05:49.849 --> 05:54.187
You and Gabrielle
are all that matters.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.271
- What's wrong?

05:55.313 --> 05:57.440
- Nothing if I have you, baby.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.150
Nothing else matters.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.695
- I'm here for you, Brad.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.947
I always have been.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.532
If you just tell me
what's happening,

06:05.573 --> 06:07.575
we can figure this out.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.621
- The fucking police
came after me again.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.707
I'm innocent, Marcie.
I'm totally innocent,

06:13.748 --> 06:16.501
but they just don't care.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.087
Marcie, please help me.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.505
I need you.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.382
Stay with me on this,

06:22.424 --> 06:23.717
for Gabrielle,

06:23.758 --> 06:26.052
for our family, please.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.514
- Come here, baby.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.810
- [sobbing]

06:33.852 --> 06:36.938
[soft dramatic music]

06:36.980 --> 06:41.067
* *

06:41.109 --> 06:44.571
- So Danny talking about
first dad versus second dad,

06:44.612 --> 06:47.741
do you think that could be more
than just a coping mechanism?

06:47.782 --> 06:49.826
- I don't know yet.
- What are you doing?

06:49.868 --> 06:52.662
- Trying to find evidence
of who attacked Anna.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.497
- Yeah, but--
- I'm closing one eye,

06:54.539 --> 06:56.458
and what I lose
in depth perception

06:56.499 --> 06:59.419
I gain in clarity of detail
and focus.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.796
- Okay. Well, what do you see?

07:01.838 --> 07:04.049
- Anna was struck mid-stride,

07:04.090 --> 07:06.468
going down precisely
where she was hit.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.594
She never saw it coming.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.137
Never had a chance to react.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.225
Why did you bring me coffee?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.769
- It's just a nice thing to do.

07:15.810 --> 07:16.853
- You're a very nice person,

07:16.895 --> 07:17.979
but you've never done this
before.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.022
Why now?

07:19.064 --> 07:20.023
- Okay, most people
would just say

07:20.065 --> 07:21.274
thank you for the coffee
and not be

07:21.316 --> 07:22.734
such a jerk about it.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.112
- Thank you for the coffee.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.655
- You're welcome.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.911
- The concern on your face--
you're worried about me.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.079
Why?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.538
- Wow. What an ego.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.124
Avi, everybody isn't thinking
about you all the time.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.626
And I'm not worried.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.169
That's just my thinking face.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.838
It makes me look worried
about everything.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.340
- I see.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.384
Davies warned you about me,

07:47.425 --> 07:50.095
that I'm getting too deeply
involved in the case.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.973
What she calls my, uh,
manic phase,

07:54.015 --> 07:56.267
which isn't a nice thing to say

07:56.309 --> 07:59.104
and most certainly not true.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.272
- Okay, yes,
Davies did call me,

08:01.314 --> 08:05.610
and yes, she's concerned that
you're losing perspective.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.113
Here's the thing
you don't know, Avi.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.074
You need me.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.952
- Yo, guys.

08:17.997 --> 08:18.998
- Whoa.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.834
- I didn't expect to see him.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.127
- What do you think it means?

08:22.168 --> 08:24.754
- He's drawn here
either out of guilt,

08:24.796 --> 08:27.007
or he genuinely wants
to help us find his wife.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.842
- Okay, so how do you
want to play this?

08:28.883 --> 08:31.219
- You be hostile.
I'll be placating.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.512
Accuse him. I'll save him.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.389
- Yeah?
- Why not?

08:34.431 --> 08:35.682
You can be hostile, right?

08:35.724 --> 08:37.225
- [scoffs]

08:37.267 --> 08:40.186
[tense music]

08:40.228 --> 08:44.149
* *

08:49.154 --> 08:50.447
- Look, I told you,
all this first father stuff

08:50.488 --> 08:51.698
is in his head, all right?
It's--it's nothing.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.033
He makes things up.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.702
- Do you believe that
your son actually saw

08:55.744 --> 08:57.579
your wife in the apartment?
- No.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.539
I mean, I don't know
what I believe anymore.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.042
The therapist says
that it's just fantasy,

09:02.083 --> 09:04.586
but also that it's significant.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.672
- Yes, because his
imagination is accelerating.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.133
It's the first time Danny
had a vision of his mother.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.218
- Exactly, and it started
when you talked to him.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.888
- Um, I never meant
to upset your son.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.348
I'm very sorry if I did.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.516
All we've ever tried to do
is to find your wife.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.143
- And I told you
she's in Mexico.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.436
So why haven't you
gone and checked?

09:21.478 --> 09:23.188
- Oh, we have been checking,

09:23.229 --> 09:24.773
but we haven't been able
to contact her at any of

09:24.814 --> 09:26.483
the numbers that you provided--
- Well, then, where is she?

09:26.524 --> 09:27.692
- Why don't you tell us?

09:27.734 --> 09:28.943
- Look, what is wrong
with you people?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.236
This isn't that
fucking hard to follow.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.905
All right,
she told me she was going

09:31.946 --> 09:33.239
to Mexico to visit her folks.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.449
If she's not there,
then I don't know

09:34.491 --> 09:35.825
where the fuck she is.
- So you say.

09:35.867 --> 09:36.951
- What does that mean?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.495
- Please, Janine.

09:38.536 --> 09:42.082
Look, we're not accusing you
of anything.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.502
You came down here to help us,
by yourself.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.587
We appreciate it.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.798
Did Dr. Sands have an opinion

09:49.839 --> 09:52.425
why Danny's fantasy world
is expanding?

09:52.467 --> 09:54.719
* *

09:54.761 --> 09:57.764
- She thinks that he
is starting to accept the fact

09:57.806 --> 09:59.891
that she's not coming back.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.018
Ever.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.645
- What about you?

10:03.687 --> 10:06.022
Are you starting to accept
that she's not coming back?

10:06.064 --> 10:07.399
I mean, at a certain point,
what does she have to do?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.275
Draw you a map?
She's gone, Mr. Serra.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.568
- What is this?
- Just face it.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.320
- Stop it, Janine, please.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.988
My partner can be
a little brusque.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.407
- Yeah, especially with liars.
- Hey!

10:15.448 --> 10:18.034
- Hey,
there's no need for that.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.119
May we search your computer?

10:19.160 --> 10:20.870
Will you consent to that?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.415
- Wh-wh-what? Why?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.709
- Oh, because when a woman's
a victim of a crime,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.503
the guilty party is often
the boyfriend or the husband.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.796
- Oh, how fucking dare you?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.464
This is insane.
- No. No.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.299
No, no, no, we have no evidence
a crime has been committed

10:33.341 --> 10:34.676
against Elisabeth Serra, none.

10:34.718 --> 10:35.927
She's an adult woman.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.303
She's allowed to go
wherever she wants,

10:37.345 --> 10:39.889
and her husband has every right
to look for her.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.268
We don't think you've done
anything wrong, Mr. Serra.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.228
The reason I ask
about your computer

10:45.270 --> 10:49.357
is because of the bomb threats,
not your wife.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.569
In your work, you--
you must draw designs

10:52.610 --> 10:53.820
of what you intend to build.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.822
I guess you do it by hand,
right?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.240
- Yeah.

10:57.282 --> 11:01.161
- In contrast, any design
research, parts, equipment,

11:01.202 --> 11:02.996
you do it by computer?

11:03.038 --> 11:04.330
- I guess.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.166
- So what we want to see
is if you've researched

11:06.207 --> 11:08.043
how to make a bomb.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.169
It's a standard procedure.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.795
We're asking all the parents.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.672
You understand?

11:12.714 --> 11:14.758
- Sure, sure.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.842
Yeah, you can have a look.

11:15.884 --> 11:16.968
You're not gonna find anything.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.928
I've got nothing to hide.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.931
[tense music]

11:21.973 --> 11:26.227
* *

11:26.269 --> 11:28.188
- Three crimes
out of one daycare.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.731
They have nothing to do
with one another.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.024
Do we buy that?

11:31.066 --> 11:33.651
- Well, everyone's guilty
of something, right?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.904
Look under a rock,
you're gonna find worms.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.364
Look under people's
public lives,

11:37.405 --> 11:40.241
you're gonna find some
crazy shit, and crimes.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.785
- It doesn't prove a pattern.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.496
Our minds like to find
connections and conspiracies

11:44.537 --> 11:46.206
even if they don't exist.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.874
"From the crooked timber
of humanity, no"...

11:47.916 --> 11:49.542
- Avi.
- "Straight thing is ever made."

11:49.584 --> 11:51.378
- What do we know?
What do we think we know?

11:51.419 --> 11:52.837
And what do we know
we don't know?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.172
If you think that
Brad Holt did it,

11:54.214 --> 11:55.674
why don't you go after him?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.133
- 'Cause I can't prove it,
and it might have been Marcie.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.551
- Why would the wife do it?

11:58.593 --> 12:00.679
- She admitted she hated Anna
because of the way

12:00.720 --> 12:02.472
she treated her daughter,

12:02.514 --> 12:04.140
which gives her
the exact same motive

12:04.182 --> 12:05.392
Elisabeth Serra had

12:05.433 --> 12:06.935
for planting the bomb
at the daycare.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.978
- Yeah, and Elisabeth Serra
is not around, but Marcie is.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.271
Add to that the fact
that her husband

12:10.313 --> 12:11.481
is having an affair with Anna,

12:11.523 --> 12:12.732
now you got jealousy
as a motive.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.234
- Well, only if Marcie knows
about the affair.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.819
- The wife always knows.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.654
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.406
Even if they don't want to know,
they know.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.657
- Hell hath no fury
and whatnot, right?

12:20.699 --> 12:22.242
- Oh, my God,
I hate that expression.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.202
It makes women sound
vindictive and crazy.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.412
- And it's also wrong.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.830
There's nothing more
wrathful than a man

12:26.871 --> 12:29.499
who finds out that his wife
was cheating on him.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.459
- Man or woman,
to lash out in such

12:31.501 --> 12:34.004
a violent,
poorly planned out attack

12:34.045 --> 12:37.382
is an act of rage,
insanity even.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.010
If anybody could be justified
in their rage,

12:40.051 --> 12:42.554
it would be Marcie Holt.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.930
- True. Go.

12:43.972 --> 12:50.103
* *

12:51.521 --> 12:53.606
- Okay, let's go.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.192
Oh, damn it, the neighbor said
the kid was gonna

12:56.234 --> 12:57.610
be with the grandparents.
So what do we do?

12:57.652 --> 12:59.320
Just follow them until they
drop her off somewhere?

12:59.362 --> 13:01.364
- Too late.
- Yeah.

13:02.782 --> 13:03.950
- What the hell is this?

13:03.992 --> 13:05.285
- Mrs. Holt, Mr. Holt,
we just have

13:05.326 --> 13:06.369
a couple of follow-up
questions.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.454
- We have not done
anything wrong.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.621
- There's no need to
raise your voice.

13:08.663 --> 13:09.622
[overlapping arguing]

13:09.664 --> 13:10.665
Shut up, Brad.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.542
- Mrs. Holt,
the last thing we want

13:12.584 --> 13:16.755
is to cause any upset to you
or your family, please.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.131
- Hey.
- Don't touch me.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.050
- I just want to speak to you.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.718
Please?

13:21.760 --> 13:24.471
* *

13:24.512 --> 13:28.516
- Mr. Holt, just take care
of your child, okay?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.143
Don't make me tackle you again.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.437
- Let me talk to you
about the other day.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.356
How long has that
been going on?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.025
- We're not here
to arrest anyone.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.152
We just want to talk.
- About what?

13:39.194 --> 13:42.113
- About you, your husband,

13:42.155 --> 13:44.074
and Anna.

13:44.115 --> 13:47.535
* *

13:47.577 --> 13:50.080
- Avi got her to come in
voluntarily.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.207
- She doesn't seem
real happy about it.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.544
Last thing we need
is two angry people in here.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.879
- Okay.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.464
I confirmed it.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.174
She's clean,
not even a parking ticket.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.300
- She wouldn't be
the first spouse

14:02.342 --> 14:04.177
to lose it over an affair.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.262
Sometimes I think
it's the law-abiding ones

14:06.304 --> 14:07.681
that go the craziest.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.432
- Come on, captain,
let me do this.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.143
Come on,
I already interviewed her.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.728
She and I,
we've built up a rapport.

14:13.770 --> 14:14.854
- A good rapport?

14:14.896 --> 14:16.815
- It's not a bad one.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.108
- Nah, I know you, Earl.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.026
You blame yourself
over what happened to Anna.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.403
That's not a good place.

14:21.444 --> 14:24.114
Go tell Avi to handle
the interrogation, please.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.161
[door opens]

14:34.416 --> 14:36.710
- I used to have anger issues.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.545
I don't anymore.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.922
And you treat me
like I still got a problem?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.382
All due respect,
kind of fucked up.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.717
- You're not helping your case.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.051
- Well, what about atonement,
huh?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.094
What about getting better?

14:46.136 --> 14:47.554
- You've been talking to Avi.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.972
- It's like you don't trust me
or something.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.016
- Earl, if I didn't trust you,
you wouldn't be here.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.892
The fact is,
not only do I trust you,

14:52.934 --> 14:54.477
I rely on you.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.439
Nobody, I mean, nobody
handles the day-to-day grind

14:57.480 --> 14:58.690
better than you, Earl.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.525
I mean that.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.029
But it's my job to help you be
the best Earl that you can be.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.032
[pensive music]

15:07.073 --> 15:08.616
* *

15:08.658 --> 15:10.243
- How long am I gonna
be treated like this?

15:10.285 --> 15:12.912
Forever?
- Yeah, Earl, forever.

15:12.954 --> 15:19.461
* *

15:20.754 --> 15:23.298
[indistinct chatter]

15:29.804 --> 15:31.431
- John.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.891
- I need to know
if you pay reward money

15:32.932 --> 15:34.559
for preventing a crime.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.019
- Depends on what
kind of crime.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.313
- What I know will save lives.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.564
- Come inside, John.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.940
- No, no, no,
it has to be worth it

15:40.982 --> 15:43.443
for me to put myself out there.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.987
- How much do you want
for this information?

15:46.029 --> 15:48.490
- No, no, I'm not looking
to take advantage, detective.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.201
I just need enough to rent
a room, get some clothes,

15:51.242 --> 15:53.703
and just give myself a chance.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.955
Is that too much to ask?
- No, it's not.

15:55.997 --> 15:58.249
I'll talk to the captain,
see what I can get you.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.168
- All right.
- If the information is good.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.795
- Oh, it's good.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.296
Oh, it's very good.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.174
- Where can I find you?

16:06.216 --> 16:07.550
- I'll find you.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.720
[soft dramatic music]

16:10.762 --> 16:13.556
* *

16:35.704 --> 16:37.372
- I haven't done anything wrong,
so how dare you--

16:37.414 --> 16:38.832
- May I stop you
for a moment, please.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.167
This is a very unique
situation for me.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.211
Usually I let suspects talk.

16:43.253 --> 16:46.089
It makes them feel better
to explain, to justify,

16:46.131 --> 16:48.341
but the results
are always the same.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.093
They end up incriminating
themselves,

16:50.135 --> 16:52.095
basically talking themselves
into a conviction.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.055
I'd rather you not
do that to yourself.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.098
- What is he doing?

16:55.140 --> 16:56.641
- He's setting her up.
- For what?

16:56.683 --> 16:58.852
- If you don't want me to talk,
then why am I here?

16:58.893 --> 17:00.562
- Did you know your husband
and Anna Harvey

17:00.603 --> 17:02.439
were having an affair?

17:02.480 --> 17:05.442
[tense music]

17:05.483 --> 17:07.360
* *

17:07.402 --> 17:09.112
- That.
- What the fuck?

17:09.154 --> 17:10.739
He just went into it
just like that?

17:10.780 --> 17:12.574
- He goes where he has to go.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.451
- Detective Malzone
walked in on your husband

17:14.492 --> 17:16.453
and Anna having sex yesterday.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.830
What people do in private
is of no interest to us.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.374
It's certainly no crime,
but lying to us is.

17:21.416 --> 17:24.753
So let me ask you again...

17:24.794 --> 17:27.213
did you know about the affair?

17:27.255 --> 17:28.590
* *

17:28.631 --> 17:30.967
- Are you fucking kidding me?

17:32.427 --> 17:33.470
- She didn't know.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.096
- She knows now.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.974
* *

17:38.016 --> 17:39.601
- You didn't know?

17:41.102 --> 17:42.395
- No.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.689
I didn't know.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.982
You think I'd stay
with that asshole

17:46.024 --> 17:48.485
if I knew that he was
cheating on me?

17:48.526 --> 17:53.198
* *

17:53.239 --> 17:55.075
- Someone attacked Anna.

17:55.116 --> 17:58.370
She's in the hospital
with very serious injuries.

17:58.411 --> 18:04.584
* *

18:04.626 --> 18:07.253
Do you know where
your husband was last night?

18:07.295 --> 18:10.757
Do you think it's possible
he attacked Anna Harvey?

18:10.799 --> 18:12.801
You told Detective Malzone
you think

18:12.842 --> 18:14.803
your husband doesn't
like conflict,

18:14.844 --> 18:16.763
that he runs
from confrontation.

18:16.805 --> 18:20.558
- I know what I told
the other detective...

18:20.600 --> 18:24.020
but that was when
I thought I knew my husband.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.107
Clearly,
I don't know him at all.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.901
- I can only imagine how
upsetting this must all be for--

18:29.943 --> 18:31.486
- Bullshit.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.864
You can't possibly know.
- You're right.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.199
I'm sorry.

18:36.241 --> 18:39.160
Now that you know the truth
about your husband,

18:39.202 --> 18:42.706
is there anything else
you want to tell me?

18:42.747 --> 18:45.125
Did he leave the bomb
outside the daycare?

18:46.543 --> 18:49.462
- [inhales shakily]

18:49.504 --> 18:51.381
If I knew, I'd tell you.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.632
Believe me.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.301
* *

18:55.343 --> 18:57.095
I'm done.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.640
- Would you let us search
your cell phone,

19:00.682 --> 19:03.018
your computer, your apartment?

19:03.059 --> 19:04.477
- Go ahead.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.479
I got nothing to hide.

19:06.521 --> 19:09.357
* *

19:09.399 --> 19:12.193
You know why the world
is going to shit right now?

19:12.235 --> 19:14.070
- Why?

19:14.112 --> 19:16.614
- Because nobody follows
the rules anymore.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.994
Why can't people just follow
the fucking rules?

19:21.036 --> 19:24.497
* *

19:24.539 --> 19:26.499
- Amen.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.293
[door opens]

19:29.502 --> 19:30.628
[door shuts]

19:33.214 --> 19:34.674
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.843
- You did well in there.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.803
You always do well.
[chuckles]

19:41.765 --> 19:43.433
You know I respect you
more than any other cop

19:43.475 --> 19:44.517
I've ever worked with, right?

19:44.559 --> 19:47.145
- You do?
- I do.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.773
'Cause you're never afraid
to tell me the truth, right?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.526
Am I--

19:53.568 --> 19:55.320
[clears throat]

19:55.362 --> 19:57.238
Am I a good cop?

19:58.573 --> 20:00.200
- Yes.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.868
You're a good cop.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.830
When you think,
when you're in control,

20:05.872 --> 20:07.540
not when you're emotional,

20:07.582 --> 20:09.626
and definitely not
when you're angry.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.252
- I know. I know. I'm trying.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.215
- God created the world
so we would have a choice,

20:15.256 --> 20:17.258
to try and not to try.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.760
The effort is everything.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.390
- Maybe for you 'cause
you got faith, you know?

20:23.431 --> 20:25.141
- It's--it's not about faith.

20:25.183 --> 20:27.894
- No?
- It's about survival.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.730
If we don't adapt
and do better, we perish.

20:30.772 --> 20:33.316
If nothing ever changes,
nothing ever changes.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.569
You're not the same cop
I partnered with

20:36.611 --> 20:38.238
when we were on patrol.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.748
- Hey, captain, so we checked
Marcie's computer,

20:48.790 --> 20:50.458
and we didn't find anything
that suggests

20:50.500 --> 20:52.043
that she knew about the affair.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.587
- Anything about making bombs,
leaving them outside daycares?

20:54.629 --> 20:56.339
- Actually, yes, there is.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.299
It's a DIY plan
for a pressure-cooker bomb.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.926
It's like the ones
from the Boston Marathon.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.220
- That's not the type we found.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.597
- I know that, but...

21:04.639 --> 21:07.100
this one is.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.768
He switched
to a simpler type of bomb.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.103
It's like the one we found.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.354
And he tried to clear
his search history,

21:11.396 --> 21:13.023
but he did not know
what he was doing.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.858
The techies found it in,
like, under a minute.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.151
- You keep saying "he."

21:16.192 --> 21:17.694
Why do you think Brad did it,
not Marcie?

21:17.736 --> 21:18.987
- Well, Marcie never
would have given us

21:19.029 --> 21:20.405
her computer without a warrant

21:20.447 --> 21:21.823
if she knew what was there.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.117
- Unless she wanted
us to find it.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.369
Pretty good way to get back
at your cheating spouse;

21:26.411 --> 21:28.913
hand over the evidence,
get him convicted of a crime.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.623
- Yeah, but the techies
also said that the searches

21:30.665 --> 21:32.959
for bomb materials were made
after someone logged in

21:33.001 --> 21:35.003
with Brad's password,
not Marcie's.

21:35.045 --> 21:36.713
- Davies.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.423
Got it. Go find Earl.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.342
Anna Harvey
just regained consciousness.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.802
[dramatic music]

21:48.516 --> 21:50.643
- You're okay.
They say you're gonna be okay.

21:50.685 --> 21:51.728
- [sighs]

21:51.770 --> 21:55.648
I'm just grateful
to be alive.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.400
- Yeah, well, don't feel any
pressure to answer anything.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.903
You've been through a lot.
- No, I want to help.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.363
- Okay.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.740
Okay, good. Um...

22:03.782 --> 22:05.408
did you see
who attacked you?

22:07.744 --> 22:09.079
- Sorry.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.875
- What do you remember about
yesterday or the day before?

22:13.917 --> 22:16.044
- I remember everything

22:16.086 --> 22:18.838
right up to walking away
from my car,

22:18.880 --> 22:22.342
and then it's just blank.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.219
- And what about the Holts?

22:24.260 --> 22:26.346
What do you remember
about them?

22:31.768 --> 22:35.730
A famous rabbi once said
the truth shall set you free.

22:35.772 --> 22:38.024
That rabbi was Jesus Christ.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.235
Truth is truth.

22:40.276 --> 22:43.154
Hiding the truth
has already cost you too much.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.490
Secrets enslave us.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.034
It's time you set
yourself free.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.995
[soft dramatic music]

22:51.037 --> 22:55.000
* *

22:55.041 --> 22:58.420
- Marcie's a very jealous
woman.

22:59.713 --> 23:02.549
She took their daughter
out of my daycare

23:02.590 --> 23:05.719
because she didn't like
the way Brad looked at me.

23:05.760 --> 23:09.806
And if she ever found out
about the affair, I'd be dead.

23:09.848 --> 23:12.934
So I broke it off with Brad,

23:12.976 --> 23:16.563
or at least I tried,

23:16.604 --> 23:18.815
and he went crazy.

23:18.857 --> 23:21.401
He started to stalk me.

23:21.443 --> 23:26.281
He was always around
the daycare, every day.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.325
I could just feel him there.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.618
- When I walked in
on the two of you--

23:30.660 --> 23:33.496
- He was going
to ruin my business

23:33.538 --> 23:35.957
and humiliate me.

23:35.999 --> 23:39.377
I went to the warehouse
to tell him to leave me alone.

23:39.419 --> 23:43.381
And he said he would if I had
sex with him one more time.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.967
So it may have looked like
we were having a good time.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.510
We weren't.

23:48.803 --> 23:51.681
I was glad when you
came through that door.

23:53.058 --> 23:57.228
And then I...
told him it was over,

23:57.270 --> 23:59.522
like really over.

24:00.774 --> 24:03.151
And that's truth.

24:03.193 --> 24:05.862
- But not the whole truth.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.447
You knew he was violent.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.616
You knew he was obsessed
with you.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.993
So you had sex with him
because you were afraid

24:12.035 --> 24:13.703
of what he would do to you,

24:13.745 --> 24:17.457
but more than that,
you were terrified

24:17.499 --> 24:19.542
of what he would do
to the children.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.920
* *

24:21.961 --> 24:25.131
Because he's the one who
left the bomb at the daycare.

24:25.173 --> 24:29.010
* *

24:29.052 --> 24:31.262
- Yes.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.890
- Finally the truth.

24:33.932 --> 24:35.517
You're free.

24:35.558 --> 24:39.187
* *

24:39.229 --> 24:42.232
- [sobbing]

24:42.273 --> 24:46.277
* *

24:47.445 --> 24:49.030
- I got probable cause
to arrest Holt,

24:49.072 --> 24:50.198
and that's what I'm gonna do.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.408
- We'll go with you.
- I got this.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.076
- You can't execute
an arrest on your own.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.369
It's against procedure.

24:54.411 --> 24:55.495
- Look, if you want to come,
then come,

24:55.537 --> 24:57.038
but don't talk to me about
procedure.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.082
Everybody's so fucking obsessed
with procedure around here

24:59.124 --> 25:00.792
that we stopped
protecting people.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.502
That shit ends right now.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.591
- Let me and Janine go.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.760
- Avi's right.
You're way too close to this.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.303
- And you're
the youngest member

25:12.345 --> 25:14.222
of the arresting team,
which means you're

25:14.264 --> 25:15.348
supposed to stay down here.

25:15.390 --> 25:16.599
You want to talk
about procedure?

25:16.641 --> 25:18.143
That's procedure.

25:20.061 --> 25:21.146
- You sure you're safe to go?

25:21.187 --> 25:22.605
- What are you talking about?

25:22.647 --> 25:24.232
This guy,
he likes to threaten kids

25:24.274 --> 25:25.358
and hit women from behind.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.818
I'm gonna be fine.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.446
- You're not safe, not because
what he'll do to you,

25:29.487 --> 25:32.282
but because of what
you might do to him.

25:32.323 --> 25:35.827
- I won't do anything
but arrest him.

25:35.869 --> 25:37.912
Please, let me do my job.

25:37.954 --> 25:38.955
Other--

25:38.997 --> 25:42.125
- [speaking Hebrew]

25:44.419 --> 25:47.297
[soft dramatic music]

25:47.339 --> 25:54.471
* *

25:56.765 --> 25:58.683
- Looks like
he's going somewhere.

25:59.976 --> 26:01.561
[loud banging]
Police.

26:01.603 --> 26:02.854
We're coming in.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.609
[grunting]

26:07.650 --> 26:08.985
Avi!

26:09.027 --> 26:12.238
[tense music]

26:12.280 --> 26:14.199
[objects clatter]

26:14.240 --> 26:19.454
* *

26:19.496 --> 26:21.956
- [grunts]
[clattering]

26:21.998 --> 26:23.208
* *

26:23.249 --> 26:26.211
[grunting]

26:26.252 --> 26:30.924
* *

26:30.965 --> 26:33.885
- [shouting]

26:35.220 --> 26:36.388
Ahh!

26:36.429 --> 26:43.561
* *

26:52.570 --> 26:54.322
- Holt said you attacked him.

26:54.364 --> 26:55.949
- Bullshit.

26:55.990 --> 26:56.950
I--

26:58.702 --> 27:00.662
Once we knocked
and announced our presence,

27:00.704 --> 27:02.497
we were fully justified
to enter the apartment,

27:02.539 --> 27:04.958
whereupon we found Holt
attempting to flee.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.334
- And then you hit him.

27:06.376 --> 27:09.462
- No, Holt started it
by throwing on Avi

27:09.504 --> 27:11.297
and then he hit me,

27:11.339 --> 27:13.425
a-and that's
when I hit him back,

27:13.466 --> 27:15.176
to defend myself and Avi.

27:15.218 --> 27:16.302
- That's true.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.637
- I didn't ask you.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.807
- I--I--I used
reasonable force.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.476
Okay? I have a right
to use force

27:23.518 --> 27:24.936
when defending myself

27:24.978 --> 27:27.313
and my partners and to
effectuate a valid arrest,

27:27.355 --> 27:29.566
which this was.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.029
- What'd you see?

27:34.070 --> 27:35.572
- Oh, I was outside.

27:37.782 --> 27:39.492
But...

27:39.534 --> 27:41.411
from where I was standing, uh,

27:41.453 --> 27:43.997
I just saw the last part
when Earl hit Holt.

27:44.039 --> 27:46.249
- I'm telling you, Captain,
if this wasn't reasonable force,

27:46.291 --> 27:48.376
nothing is, honest to God.

27:50.253 --> 27:51.671
- He's right.

28:01.598 --> 28:03.725
- Holt's been charged
with terrorist threats

28:03.767 --> 28:06.519
and attempted murder
for the attack on Anna Harvey.

28:06.561 --> 28:09.314
We still have no idea what
happened to Elisabeth Serra.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.024
It's not the case
we started with,

28:11.066 --> 28:12.484
but it's the one we have left.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.361
Find out what happened to her.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.656
Shut the door.

28:25.372 --> 28:28.333
[soft mysterious music]

28:28.375 --> 28:35.507
* *

28:43.014 --> 28:44.849
[knocking on door]

28:46.559 --> 28:48.895
- What's the deal with Earl?

28:48.937 --> 28:50.105
- Come in.

28:50.146 --> 28:51.856
- When I saw his face
through that window,

28:51.898 --> 28:53.274
I saw rage,

28:53.316 --> 28:54.818
like he was gonna kill Holt,

28:54.859 --> 28:56.611
like he wanted to kill Holt.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.321
I know that face
from the street,

28:58.363 --> 29:01.199
and I do not like it.

29:01.241 --> 29:03.034
[sighs]

29:03.076 --> 29:05.036
Is Earl a bad cop?

29:06.496 --> 29:08.123
- It's a sin
to slander a person,

29:08.164 --> 29:10.500
especially one who worked hard
to be better.

29:10.542 --> 29:11.751
Your question itself is--

29:11.793 --> 29:13.753
- Is Earl a bad cop?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.088
- No.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.388
He and I were on
patrol together.

29:23.430 --> 29:24.723
I was a rookie.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.725
He had a few years in.

29:26.766 --> 29:29.519
There was an encounter,
it led to an arrest.

29:29.561 --> 29:32.272
Earl was accused of
using excessive force.

29:32.313 --> 29:33.732
- Did he do it?

29:33.773 --> 29:35.150
- You wear a uniform
just like the rest of us,

29:35.191 --> 29:36.776
you know what happens
on the street.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.236
- Yeah, I know what's
supposed to happen.

29:38.278 --> 29:40.238
I'm asking did he do it.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.532
- If you're so interested in
details, you should ask Earl.

29:42.574 --> 29:45.702
- I will, but right now
I'm asking you, Avi.

29:47.370 --> 29:50.665
- Internal Affairs cleared Earl
of all wrongdoing.

29:50.707 --> 29:52.250
You can read the report
for yourself.

29:52.292 --> 29:54.669
- What a full-throated
denial of his guilt.

29:54.711 --> 29:57.505
- If he were guilty,
he wouldn't be my colleague.

29:57.547 --> 29:59.132
The hardest part
of being a police officer

29:59.174 --> 30:01.134
is also being a human being.
- Oh.

30:01.176 --> 30:03.178
- Earl is a good man.

30:03.219 --> 30:06.639
He's not a perfect man.
- What does that mean?

30:06.681 --> 30:09.267
Can I trust him
or can I not trust him?

30:09.309 --> 30:11.728
Because I will not cover up
for anybody ever.

31:07.992 --> 31:09.744
- Actually, I'm right on time.

31:09.786 --> 31:11.663
- Well, in my book,
that means you're late.

31:11.705 --> 31:14.624
Being 10 minutes early
means you're on time.

31:14.666 --> 31:15.917
- So noted.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.503
Uh, does he know we're here?
- No.

31:18.545 --> 31:21.589
I thought you'd want to see his
expression when we walked in.

31:49.784 --> 31:51.202
who planted the bomb
at the daycare.

31:51.244 --> 31:52.787

31:52.829 --> 31:54.748

when the kids are involved.

31:54.789 --> 31:57.375
So thank you.
That's a huge weight off.

31:57.417 --> 32:00.337
- You've made a lot of progress
in a short period of time.

32:00.378 --> 32:03.340
- Yeah, I like to get it done
and move on.

32:04.883 --> 32:06.801

32:06.843 --> 32:10.680
It's such a sacred act

Mr. Serra?

- Does what bring me joy?

32:25.779 --> 32:27.822
- This, your job.

32:27.864 --> 32:30.033
Maybe it's an indulgence
for your clients,

32:30.075 --> 32:32.410
but does the applying
of your skill

32:32.452 --> 32:35.288
bring you satisfaction?

32:35.330 --> 32:37.248
- Um,

32:37.290 --> 32:39.709
yeah, sure, I guess.

32:39.751 --> 32:41.252
- And what about Elisabeth?

32:41.294 --> 32:44.756
Was she equally satisfied
in her work?

32:44.798 --> 32:46.383
- What do you mean was?

32:46.424 --> 32:49.177
- Well, she quit her job
about a month ago.

32:49.219 --> 32:50.637
Did you know that?

32:51.471 --> 32:52.597
- No.

32:52.639 --> 32:53.765
- She didn't talk to you
about that?

32:53.807 --> 32:54.891
- I just said no.

32:54.933 --> 32:56.768
[tense music]

32:56.810 --> 32:59.896
Why--why--why would
she quit her job?

32:59.938 --> 33:01.398
She loved working at that club.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.443
- I don't understand why
she loved it, though.

33:05.485 --> 33:08.655
What was there to love about
planning expensive events

33:08.697 --> 33:10.156
for the ultra-rich?
- I don't know.

33:10.198 --> 33:12.784
She loved being around those--
those people, that world,

money, you know?

33:14.160 --> 33:15.787
How it gets made,
what people do with it.

33:15.829 --> 33:17.163
It interested her.

33:17.205 --> 33:19.874
- Who handled your family's
finances, Mr. Serra?

33:19.916 --> 33:21.960
You or Elisabeth?
- She did.

33:22.002 --> 33:24.462
The banking, the taxes,
all of it.

33:24.504 --> 33:25.672
- Investments?

33:25.714 --> 33:26.965
She's the one
who bought the crypto?

33:27.007 --> 33:29.300
- Yeah, I don't know
anything about that.

33:29.342 --> 33:32.429
- But you do know that she lost
a lot of money on it?

33:32.470 --> 33:33.805
- Yeah.

33:33.847 --> 33:35.640
I mean, she--
she made a lot of money first

33:35.682 --> 33:37.183
till it all went to shit.

33:37.225 --> 33:40.020
But, you know,
I don't care about any of that.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.814
- But Elisabeth cared, no?

33:42.856 --> 33:45.817
She must have been devastated
by the loss.

33:47.152 --> 33:48.278
- Yeah.

33:49.779 --> 33:51.322
Yeah, she was.

She even--she even talked
about killing herself.

don't be stupid.

34:02.334 --> 34:04.919

34:04.961 --> 34:07.547
I never blamed her

It wasn't her fault.

34:09.257 --> 34:15.347

34:15.388 --> 34:17.307
- So they have different
thoughts on money, right?

34:17.349 --> 34:18.516
That's normal.

34:18.558 --> 34:19.684
The number one thing
that couples fight about

34:19.726 --> 34:20.935
is finances.

34:20.977 --> 34:22.187
- He didn't say
they fought about it.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.105
He said Elisabeth
felt responsible,

34:24.147 --> 34:27.025
blamed herself for the losses,
and became suicidal.

34:27.067 --> 34:29.194
- Well, yeah,
if she became suicidal.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.154

You must be very proud

to say I got lucky?

35:13.613 --> 35:14.989
Sorry.

35:15.031 --> 35:16.449
Luck had nothing to do with it.

right?

35:18.618 --> 35:21.371
Your hard work and your talent
got you here?

35:21.413 --> 35:23.289
- Well, you're being sarcastic,
but this country

35:23.331 --> 35:25.250
went to hell when we stopped
encouraging people

35:25.291 --> 35:26.751
to strive for success.

35:26.793 --> 35:28.712
I'm not going to apologize
for what I've earned.

35:28.753 --> 35:31.798
- We think Elisabeth Serra
killed herself.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.967
- Never.
Not in a million years.

35:34.009 --> 35:35.552
She had too much left to do.

35:35.593 --> 35:37.637
- She blamed herself
for losing an enormous amount

35:37.679 --> 35:41.391
of the family's money,
thereby failing her sons.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.268
- Who told you this?
Her husband?

35:43.309 --> 35:45.311
- Apparently some kind of
bad crypto investment.

35:45.353 --> 35:47.272
- Is there any other kind
of crypto investment?

35:49.607 --> 35:51.860
Paul Serra knows jack shit
about crypto

35:51.901 --> 35:55.488
or any other kind of investment.

35:55.530 --> 35:59.075
The guy's a fucking loser--
selfish, too.

35:59.117 --> 36:00.577
He held her down.

36:00.618 --> 36:03.455
And don't tell me
what a great dad he was.

36:03.496 --> 36:05.248
If Paul really cared,
he would have

36:05.290 --> 36:06.791
let Elisabeth leave with me.

36:06.833 --> 36:10.295
I offered to take care
of her boys, and I meant it.

36:10.337 --> 36:13.673
Can you imagine what I could
have done for them?

36:13.715 --> 36:16.009
- Still, it's strange to me
that you dismissed

36:16.051 --> 36:17.719
the notion of suicide.

36:17.761 --> 36:19.929
How can any of us know
what the reaction

36:19.971 --> 36:21.348
of another human being will be

36:21.389 --> 36:23.308
in the face of guilt and shame?

36:25.226 --> 36:28.146
- I knew Elisabeth
like I know myself.

36:28.188 --> 36:30.023
We were that similar.

36:30.065 --> 36:34.194
She loved life,
had dreams, talent, hope,

36:34.235 --> 36:37.322
but she was a thoroughbred
running in a dog race.

36:37.364 --> 36:39.407
What a fucking tragedy.

36:41.701 --> 36:44.371
If Elisabeth is dead,

36:44.412 --> 36:46.831
she didn't do it herself.

36:46.873 --> 36:48.375
Paul killed her.

36:51.294 --> 36:53.838
- Do you ever get tired
of people lying to you?

36:53.880 --> 36:55.298
- You think Hanney is lying?

36:55.340 --> 36:58.385
- Yeah, the only person
that guy loves is himself.

36:58.426 --> 37:00.595
- I don't fully dismiss Hanney
or anyone else

37:00.637 --> 37:03.223
of being involved
in Elisabeth's disappearance,

37:03.264 --> 37:05.266
but if Hanney was responsible,

37:05.308 --> 37:07.102
he would have embraced
the suicide notion.

37:07.143 --> 37:08.353
He didn't.
He blamed Paul Serra.

37:08.395 --> 37:09.813
- Yeah, because Paul
is a threat.

37:09.854 --> 37:11.690
He keeps Hanney from winning.

37:11.731 --> 37:13.274
I know guys like Hanney.

37:13.316 --> 37:14.776
They're the fathers
of my friends,

37:14.818 --> 37:18.488
and they just think that
the rules don't apply to them.

37:20.907 --> 37:22.492
- You don't like rich people?

37:22.534 --> 37:25.286
- Sometimes they get away
with murder.

37:25.328 --> 37:28.707
Biggest lie of all is that
no one is above the law.

37:28.748 --> 37:30.166
It's bullshit.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.711
Only thing that matters
is the golden rule.

37:32.752 --> 37:35.088
Whoever has the gold
makes the rules.

37:35.130 --> 37:36.589
And guys like Hanney think
they can take

37:36.631 --> 37:38.508
whatever they want, no problem.

37:38.550 --> 37:41.386
Somebody's business,
somebody's wife.

37:43.847 --> 37:45.223

37:45.265 --> 37:46.933
- If a woman says
she's gonna run off with you

37:46.975 --> 37:48.601
and then she just doesn't
show up,

37:48.643 --> 37:52.564
how do you not at least check
to see what happened?

37:52.605 --> 37:55.567
Especially a crazy egotist
like Hanney.

37:55.608 --> 37:57.068
- Maybe you were right
to begin with

37:57.110 --> 37:58.903
that he didn't really love her,

37:58.945 --> 38:01.156
or maybe he didn't want
to know the truth.

38:01.197 --> 38:03.575
Some people don't,
or can't face it.

38:03.616 --> 38:06.119

with your father's case?

38:07.704 --> 38:10.498
- What happened
to Elisabeth Serra?

38:12.542 --> 38:15.420
- I think that Hanney begged her
to go with him,

38:15.462 --> 38:17.422
and she thought about it,

38:17.464 --> 38:19.382
and then she said no.

38:19.424 --> 38:22.093
He loses his shit,

38:22.135 --> 38:23.261
and then he killed her,

38:23.303 --> 38:26.473
and he dumped her body
in the ocean.

38:27.849 --> 38:29.934
- And now he's blaming
Paul Serra?

38:29.976 --> 38:31.353
- Yeah.

38:31.394 --> 38:33.355
These people always shift
the blame on someone else.
