01:59.400 --> 02:00.799
The puffballs!

02:02.040 --> 02:06.716
When the puffballs come,
cold winter's almost gone.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.631
When the puffballs soar,
then winter's no more.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.391
I'll get the best one.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.632
- Ciccio, les go to the seashore.
- Look at that one up there.

02:38.720 --> 02:43.396
In our town puffballs
and spring arrive together.

02:45.080 --> 02:50.359
These are puffballs that drift around.
They go here and they go there.

02:50.520 --> 02:54.911
Soaring over the cemetery,
where all rest in peace.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.799
Soaring over the beachfront
and over the Germans...

02:57.960 --> 03:00.952
...who do not feel the cold.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.152
Drifting, drifting.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.151
Swirling.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.198
Swirling, swirling.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.796
Drifting, drifting, drifting!

03:14.560 --> 03:17.870
I'm the last of 14 children.
When I was born...

03:18.040 --> 03:21.510
...my father had had enough,
so he called me "Definitivo."

03:21.680 --> 03:25.639
If he'd had enough sooner,
there'd be one less chatterbox.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.279
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.112
See you in the square.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.835
I've come for my sister.
Is it too early?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.479
Your sister's here.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.074
Oh, Fiorella! I'm all done here.
Come in.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.391
If is because of that thing,
I better calm down, you beast!

03:42.560 --> 03:46.109
This year the bonfire is 4 feet taller
than last year.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.838
Those are my shoes!

03:48.000 --> 03:50.833
Going to the bonfire tonight?
What are you playing?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.434
I've composed a brand new tune.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.034
Let me give you a little taste.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.437
Is unique. It has no rivals.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.672
- Brava, Gradisca.
- Go! Go!

04:11.400 --> 04:15.473
Now, Dad, we'll watch them light
the bonfire, then I'll take you home.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.709
The doctor says you must
go to bed early.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.713
Tell the doctor he's an asshole.
I'll go to bed when I please!

04:20.880 --> 04:23.997
You'll end up in the hospital,
and this time I'll leave you there.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.676
Blockheads! Numskulls!

04:30.440 --> 04:32.396
Come and buy from Biscein.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.714
Let me through!
Thas my place!

04:41.720 --> 04:43.199
You creeps!

04:43.360 --> 04:46.591
Let me through!
Listen to this one!

04:47.680 --> 04:50.353
A father can take care of 100 kids,
but 100 kids...

04:50.520 --> 04:53.159
...can't take care of one father.
Thas the truth.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.278
- I want to set off a firecracker.
- You stay here!

04:57.560 --> 05:01.189
Hey, Giudizio, catch!

05:04.000 --> 05:07.629
I can, I order and I want!
Long live Giudizio!

05:11.720 --> 05:14.951
Volpina, have you made love today?

05:15.120 --> 05:17.429
Say, how many did you service?

05:19.160 --> 05:22.675
I bet you would even dip a cock
in your morning coffee!

05:24.440 --> 05:25.793
Here she is!

05:26.840 --> 05:30.469
You're the greatest, Gradisca.
Greta Garbo's got nothing on you!

05:34.280 --> 05:35.599
Les go over there.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.238
Damn you!

05:39.400 --> 05:42.073
Ronald Coleman, we're over here!

05:43.200 --> 05:46.078
Giudizio, take this chair too.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.552
Burn this one too!
Put it on top.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.199
Put the old witch in it.

05:51.360 --> 05:55.353
You scoundrel, I'll stuff that chair
down your throat. Take it home now!

06:05.240 --> 06:06.719
The old witch!

06:07.840 --> 06:09.831
The old witch is here.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.719
Let me wed her before you burn her!

06:17.040 --> 06:20.874
- What are you looking at, dummy?
- I'm not looking. Actually...

06:21.040 --> 06:22.553
Stop it!

06:26.240 --> 06:29.198
Don't look, otherwise
you'll get too excited!

06:42.760 --> 06:44.910
Firecrackers!
Bring the firecrackers!

06:45.080 --> 06:47.833
Les light the bonfire
and burn the old...

07:04.280 --> 07:07.829
Les burn the old witch!
Light the bonfire!

07:08.000 --> 07:12.869
And with this fire, witch so old,
you take with you the freezing cold.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.157
Here's spring!

07:16.320 --> 07:19.756
- But I don't have matches.
- Your beloved does, sweetheart.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.552
Here you go.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.512
Les burn the old witch!

07:29.680 --> 07:32.478
Long live Giudizio!

07:32.640 --> 07:36.349
I can, I order and I want!

07:44.360 --> 07:47.716
- Where's the ladder?
- Do you want the ladder?

07:47.880 --> 07:50.314
Really? Take it!

07:50.480 --> 07:52.118
Give it to me.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.474
- I'm burning here!
- Take it.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.916
Give me the ladder!
The ladder!

08:03.080 --> 08:05.958
In America, I saw bonfires
350 feet high.

08:06.120 --> 08:09.510
- When were you ever there?
- My parents are American.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.919
I'll break your legs!

08:13.080 --> 08:15.548
You should hear what my dad
can do with his ass!

08:15.720 --> 08:17.950
Hurray for spring!

08:22.440 --> 08:24.431
It gives me a funny feeling.
How about you?

08:24.600 --> 08:28.718
Yes, but is winter thas
dying and now spring is here!

08:28.880 --> 08:31.678
I can feel spring
all over me already!

09:11.720 --> 09:14.314
Our respects, count.
Our respects, sister.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.438
- Our respects, little countess.
- Thank you.

09:20.720 --> 09:26.955
Drink a little, ill do you good!
Even your auns drinking. Look!

09:41.600 --> 09:43.192
No!

09:43.360 --> 09:47.239
Why? No, no, no!

09:50.680 --> 09:54.070
Good old Lallo!
No one would know you're 60.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.872
Look at that!
Your brother really is an asshole!

09:59.040 --> 10:00.553
He's a youngster!

10:05.080 --> 10:07.640
Now see the Malaysian tiger leap!

10:08.520 --> 10:11.671
- You almost landed on the roof!
- You'll get it later!

10:11.840 --> 10:14.229
- Look at his shoe.
- The heel's come off.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.109
- Now you'll do without one!
- Where is that other useless ass gone?

10:21.080 --> 10:23.036
Ciccio, throw the big bang
on the fire!

10:23.200 --> 10:28.354
What the hell are you doing? Go to bed!
I'll put you in boarding school!

10:32.800 --> 10:36.759
Here's Scureza, the fart of Corpoló!

10:38.320 --> 10:40.880
Bravo, Scureza! Bravo!

10:44.840 --> 10:46.068
Scureza of Corpoló!

10:46.240 --> 10:49.710
I will kick your ass
till your ass gets raw!

11:01.640 --> 11:05.519
The origins of this town are lost
in the mist of time.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.877
In the municipal muzeum,
there are stone implements...

11:09.040 --> 11:10.871
- All the best.
- My respects.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.508
...that date back to prehistoric times.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.036
I, myself, have found
some graffiti of great age...

11:17.200 --> 11:19.509
...in the caves
of Count Lovignano's estate.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.708
Be that as it may, the first
certain date is 268 B. C...

11:24.880 --> 11:28.873
...when this became a Roman colony
and the start of the Emilian Way.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.393
Mr. Lawyer!

11:35.480 --> 11:39.189
This too is characteristic
of the spirit of these people...

11:39.360 --> 11:42.397
...who have Roman and Celtic blood
in their veins.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.519
Theirs is an exuberant, generous,
tenacious nature.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.389
From the divine poet Dante
to Pascoli, D'annunzio...

11:50.560 --> 11:54.599
...a great number of brilliant minds
have lauded this land...

11:54.760 --> 11:58.469
...while innumerable are its sons
who have contributed greatly...

11:58.640 --> 12:02.076
...to the arts, science, religion
and politics...

12:04.320 --> 12:09.075
Who are you? You're so clever
but too gutless to show yourself.

12:10.600 --> 12:15.913
Come out and show yourself!
I'll explain everything face to face.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.798
- Mr. Lawyer!
- Yes, yes.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.916
Gentlemen!

12:35.200 --> 12:36.599
Quiet!

12:47.720 --> 12:51.679
- Shall we all take our places?
- Lf you insist, headmaster.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.037
But I never come out well
in photographs.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.670
You boys at the back,
get on the bench!

13:02.560 --> 13:06.189
- Now what, De Santis?
- It wasn't me, sir!

13:06.760 --> 13:08.830
Aldina!

13:27.680 --> 13:29.716
Belaria, it looks just like you.

13:30.560 --> 13:35.873
- Whas happening?
- Gigliozzi! Be seated.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.799
Hold it like that, please.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.793
Hold it like that. There you go.
Done!

13:45.320 --> 13:47.993
- What is this?
- A stone.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.869
- Yes, but what is it?
- I know, is for a slingshot.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.473
Is it an elephans testicle?

13:54.480 --> 13:56.630
I'll tell you. Is a pendulum.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.076
You certainly all know
a pendulum clock.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.550
- And how does it go?
- Tick, tock...

14:14.800 --> 14:19.112
Where did Tiberius retire to when he
gave up leadership of the Empire?

14:19.280 --> 14:20.554
To Capri. Yes.

14:28.400 --> 14:32.473
- The murder of Agrippina?
- 69 A.D.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.919
Why have you given me a bad mark?
Wasn't it 69?

14:39.800 --> 14:43.349
- It was 59 A.D.
- Are you sure?

14:43.520 --> 14:46.478
What do you mean?
It was 59 A. D!

14:47.000 --> 14:48.513
Holy cow! I knew it was!

14:48.680 --> 14:51.319
You'll drive me crazy!
Get back to your seat!

14:51.480 --> 14:53.789
What have I done?
Why couldn't it have been 69?

14:57.640 --> 15:00.996
"There will come the day
when a renewed Italy...

15:01.160 --> 15:05.472
...will take to the field of battle
on her own behalf...

15:05.640 --> 15:09.235
...and not defend her soil
for others with their weapons..."

15:09.400 --> 15:13.473
- universal, being spirit incarnate
in the state...

15:13.640 --> 15:17.315
...and cannot but enter into
the true nature of the church.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.393
This reconciliation between state
and church occurred through...

15:21.560 --> 15:26.111
...a demiurge, which brought order
to members of state and church...

15:26.280 --> 15:29.875
...demanding iron discipline
and the right to intervene...

15:30.040 --> 15:32.110
...in all aspects of individual life.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.313
He is Goďs chosen Son...

15:35.480 --> 15:38.597
...because he has the same power
as the Father.

15:38.760 --> 15:42.469
Then there is the Holy Spirit
to be placed on the same level...

15:42.640 --> 15:45.279
...as the Father and the Son.
Is that clear?

15:45.440 --> 15:48.273
This is why God is one,
and also a Trinity.

15:49.160 --> 15:54.439
- Today, I'll speak of the great Giotto.
- Whose balls exploded in a grotto!

15:55.560 --> 15:57.869
Do you know, boys and girls...

15:58.040 --> 16:01.999
...why Giotto is so important
in Italian painting?

16:03.720 --> 16:08.316
I will tell you.
Because he invented perspective.

16:08.480 --> 16:14.157
Perspective.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.793
Miss, can I leave the room?
Bobo has let a real stinker!

16:19.320 --> 16:20.594
What do you mean?

16:21.240 --> 16:24.755
You're nuts. Is not true.
I never fart.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.115
- You do. You do.
- I do not!

16:28.840 --> 16:30.876
Alboin...

16:32.720 --> 16:37.919
...signed the peace.
Gigliozzi! Get out!

16:38.400 --> 16:40.834
Here you go. Is not difficult.
Solve it.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.432
Gordimi.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.834
Why have you stopped?
You were doing fine.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.911
What did you want to do?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.672
- Give me a clue.
- Pass it to me.

17:00.840 --> 17:06.311
Just think a moment.
9X plus the square root of 3K.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.599
But is so obvious!

17:11.640 --> 17:15.519
Move over. Whas this scribbling?
What have you done?

17:16.920 --> 17:20.230
Les go over it together.
What is written here?

17:21.000 --> 17:25.117
What is this written here?
I mean, you must know how to read!

17:25.280 --> 17:28.078
- But I...
- Be quiet!

17:34.760 --> 17:38.309
9X plus the square root of 3K...

17:40.880 --> 17:43.075
Here's the solution.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.913
1 X equals 140.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.789
2X equals 3/5 of the total,
less the difference.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.030
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.517
What have you done?
Have you gone nuts?

17:58.960 --> 18:00.996
Janitor! Janitor!

18:15.640 --> 18:18.234
- Greek is beautiful, isn't it?
- You bet!

18:18.400 --> 18:20.994
- Is so musical, don't you think?
- Oh, yeah!

18:22.320 --> 18:24.834
Emarpszamen! Repeat after me.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.830
- Silence! Be quiet, kids.
- I can't do it.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.195
- Try again.
- Could you be so kind...

18:34.360 --> 18:37.397
- Tell me, dear.
- Could I hear it again, please?

18:37.840 --> 18:42.277
Certainly, certainly.
Listen. Emarpszamen.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.396
Careful with the tongue.

18:44.560 --> 18:48.519
It must go here
against the palate...

18:48.800 --> 18:50.995
...then you spit it out.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.148
Try it.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.756
- Silence.
- I just can't do it.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.832
Okay. Come on, try it again.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.073
Come on now. Greek is so difficult.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.356
How did you put your tongue?

19:17.360 --> 19:19.078
Not that way, between your teeth.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.912
- Like this?
- You almost got it.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.354
Thas right.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.835
- Go back to your seat, damn it!
- I nearly got it that time.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.198
- Who's that?
- Is Ciccio.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.914
Hey, is Ciccio!

19:39.080 --> 19:42.390
- Leave me the smoke.
- Just one drag.

19:42.760 --> 19:46.230
Is it true that Aldina
ripped up your poem?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.879
I've written another one!

19:48.040 --> 19:52.272
What a kind, gentle maiden
Art thou, beautiful Aldina

19:52.600 --> 19:57.151
You radiate so bright
My heart beats with all its might

19:59.000 --> 20:02.754
- Is nice and warm outside.
- I prefer Aldina's mother.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.876
I wonder who's on the beach
this morning.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.514
Fu Manchu!

20:31.120 --> 20:32.678
Volpina!

20:39.920 --> 20:41.717
Volpina!

20:41.880 --> 20:43.438
Come here!

20:49.200 --> 20:51.236
What are you doing here?

20:51.400 --> 20:54.073
- What do you want?
- I've lost my pussycat.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.832
Oh, yeah?

20:57.360 --> 21:01.911
There are no cats here.
Be good, go home.

21:04.440 --> 21:09.230
Is hot, isn't it?
Aren't you all hot?

21:12.040 --> 21:13.792
What an odd girl this one is.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.748
Come on now, go home.
There are no cats here.

21:19.320 --> 21:23.279
Boss, brick-head has written
another poem.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.431
When do you write
all these poems?

21:25.600 --> 21:28.876
Brick-head, les hear this poem.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.715
Okay, les hear it.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.033
- Whas its title?
- "Bricks."

21:36.200 --> 21:40.034
- Oh, nice!
- My grandfather laid bricks

21:40.200 --> 21:42.350
My father laid bricks

21:42.520 --> 21:46.513
And I lay bricks too
But I still don't see my house, do you?

21:49.560 --> 21:51.312
- Bravo!
- Way to go!

21:51.760 --> 21:54.274
Right. Why not?
I get what you're saying.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.637
Is quite right. But I too
was once a poor man...

21:57.800 --> 22:00.519
...and I have gradually worked my way
up to master builder.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.752
You can't get everything at once!

22:03.920 --> 22:06.832
You have to be patient,
you have to work.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.677
- By working, one can. You must work.
- Aren't we working?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.558
Thas enough!

22:19.520 --> 22:22.080
- No drinking before the soup.
- But I'm thirsty!

22:22.240 --> 22:24.549
- You can't drink!
- Where have you read that?

22:24.720 --> 22:27.280
It blows up the stomach.
I read it in the Sunday paper.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.316
- Keep your hands to yourself!
- There's a spoon missing.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.230
- Is it hot, Lallino?
- A little.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.110
- I want a lot, Mom.
- You'll get your share.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.872
Would you like some more, Lallo?
There's some left, you know.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.677
- Is there enough salt?
- Yes, Grandpa.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.638
- Gina, give him a little.
- He's already eaten.

22:55.800 --> 22:59.713
My father's father was known
as "Big Meat."

22:59.880 --> 23:02.314
He lived to be 107
and he was still doing it!

23:08.480 --> 23:10.516
- Yeah, and?
- And then...

23:10.680 --> 23:16.118
...when I was little, he taught me
you have to eat at 11 in the morning...

23:16.280 --> 23:20.068
...before the sun burns your head,
and at 4 in the afternoon.

23:20.240 --> 23:25.268
Otherwise is all poison that ends up
here and gets into your blood.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.029
- Aren't you eating?
- No!

23:30.200 --> 23:32.794
What have you done to your mother?
Huh?

23:32.960 --> 23:34.518
- Nothing!
- Nothing, Dad.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.552
They've done nothing.

23:36.720 --> 23:40.315
Bloody hell!
Get up at 4 in the morning...

23:40.480 --> 23:42.391
...slave away all day like a mule.

23:42.560 --> 23:47.554
Then come home to eat some bread
and see a bunch of long faces!

23:51.240 --> 23:53.549
Now you won't have to
see them anymore!

23:53.920 --> 23:56.753
Ma'am, is time to take
the boiler off.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.194
Yes.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.515
- Is so heavy!
- Whas the matter?

24:01.680 --> 24:02.908
Nothing!

24:03.080 --> 24:05.036
- Eat something, then.
- I don't want to!

24:05.200 --> 24:07.475
- Why not?
- Because I just don't!

24:08.440 --> 24:11.159
- Shut that door. Is cold.
- Yes, yes.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.954
I'm still convalescent.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.153
- Who can it be at this hour?
- How would I know?

24:19.320 --> 24:22.551
- Shall I see who it is?
- Yes, you go.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.075
What do you think my bottom is,
holy water?

24:27.240 --> 24:30.232
Chicken always gets stuck
between my teeth.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.437
- Can I have some more, Dad?
- Stop right there!

24:33.600 --> 24:35.875
- Is just a wing.
- I'll give it to you!

24:36.040 --> 24:39.316
Tell me, Miranda,
have you put mint in it?

24:39.480 --> 24:43.029
No, not mint! Sage!

24:43.200 --> 24:46.397
But you realized there was
something different, didn't you?

24:46.560 --> 24:48.994
Lallino has a good palate.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.151
Gina! Who the hell is it?

24:55.560 --> 24:58.393
- So?
- Mr. Biondi is here.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.830
- I was eating!
- Isn't he the bishop's cousin?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.117
- I want it. I want it.
- Hey! What are you, bottomless pits?!

25:04.280 --> 25:06.271
Anyone would think I never fed you!

25:07.560 --> 25:09.118
Uncle, look!

25:09.400 --> 25:12.039
- Lf your dad sees you...
- Big deal!

25:12.240 --> 25:16.552
Uncle, do that nice trick for us.
Come on, just once.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.677
Look, Titta!

25:21.000 --> 25:22.956
You're good!

25:23.120 --> 25:25.953
- Is difficult, isn't it?
- Well, you know...

25:39.680 --> 25:41.318
Good wine, this Sangiovese.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.436
- Good, huh?
- Yep!

25:43.600 --> 25:46.114
- Where were you last night?
- Me?

25:46.280 --> 25:49.989
- At the cinema.
- What was on?

25:50.760 --> 25:55.993
Uncle, the Americans were trying
to get into Comanche territory...

25:56.160 --> 25:59.755
...and they built a bridge
for the railway, but the Indians...

25:59.920 --> 26:03.151
...shot arrows at them from above.
It was a massacre, Dad!

26:03.320 --> 26:05.311
What were you up to,
you little criminal?!

26:05.480 --> 26:06.913
Whas happened now?

26:07.080 --> 26:08.638
- I didn't do anything!
- Stop!

26:08.800 --> 26:10.074
Aurelio, leave him alone!

26:10.240 --> 26:13.357
Come here!
I'll put you in the hospital if I catch you!

26:13.520 --> 26:17.115
- Aurelio, people are watching.
- Morning.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.470
Starting tomorrow, no more school,
no more allowance.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.596
He can start working with me!

26:24.760 --> 26:28.548
- But you'll have to pay me!
- With a hammer in the face!

26:28.720 --> 26:31.917
You have to tell me
who fathered this piece of shit!

26:32.080 --> 26:34.674
At his age, I'd been working
three years!

26:34.840 --> 26:37.718
Yes, I know. And gave
all the money to Grandma.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.199
- You...
- Enough now!

26:39.360 --> 26:41.157
- Come and eat, you two!
- Yes.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.038
Good morning.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.512
Everyone in town laughs at us,
even the roosters.

26:50.240 --> 26:55.553
- In my own home, I'll do as I please!
- Listen to God Almighty!

26:55.720 --> 26:59.838
Give me your brother's plate.
Give it to me!

27:00.000 --> 27:03.595
- Put that plate down.
- What has he done?

27:03.760 --> 27:06.558
I'll show you what he's done.

27:06.720 --> 27:09.632
What has he done?
What has he done?

27:09.840 --> 27:12.718
- Tell me or I'll wring your neck!
- I don't know, Mom!

27:12.880 --> 27:14.393
What do you mean,
you don't know?

27:14.560 --> 27:17.836
This is Mr. Biondi's hat.
He was at the cinema last night.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.560
Just smell it.
Know who did that?

27:20.720 --> 27:23.234
That brat of a son of yours.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.995
He pissed over the rail of the balcony,
right on Biondi's head.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.798
That cost me three bills!

27:28.960 --> 27:32.032
I'm sure it was those delinquents
he hangs around with!

27:32.200 --> 27:36.432
Damn it! Always the same story!
You've got to stop taking his side.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.192
He's getting worse and worse!

27:38.360 --> 27:42.911
They're a pair of little criminals!
You've brought them up all wrong!

27:43.080 --> 27:47.517
Okay, you do it, then!
Les see how well you do!

27:47.680 --> 27:53.152
I can't stand it anymore!
I'm going crazy! I'm going mad!

27:53.320 --> 27:56.153
- I'll kill the lot of you!
- Yeah, sure.

27:59.200 --> 28:03.352
I'll put strychnine in your soup!

28:03.520 --> 28:06.239
Thas what I'll do
one of these days!

28:06.400 --> 28:11.110
- You won't put strychnine in the soup.
- Oh, yes, I will!

28:11.280 --> 28:12.599
One, two, three.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.831
Oh, yeah?
But I'll kill myself first!

28:20.000 --> 28:22.434
- Right now!
- Good!

28:22.600 --> 28:26.991
This time I will!
No! I'll kill myself first!

28:29.000 --> 28:30.592
Uncle, look at Dad!

28:39.480 --> 28:42.233
Why does everything happen to me?
What have I done?

28:54.360 --> 28:56.874
Goddamn it all!

28:58.880 --> 29:02.077
- Have you hurt yourself?
- What are you doing on the floor?

29:17.080 --> 29:20.231
- Hey, man. Avoid this one if you can.
- Not the hat!

29:23.360 --> 29:24.634
Good evening, headmaster.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.108
- There's Gradisca!
- Where?

29:32.320 --> 29:33.992
Over there!

29:46.560 --> 29:48.994
If you give the archbishop
permission...

29:49.160 --> 29:51.435
...to sell holy pictures
in the schools...

29:51.600 --> 29:54.319
...l'm sure we can settle the matter
between us.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.400
When are you showing The Vale
of Love with Gary Cooper?

30:09.560 --> 30:12.757
- Next week, my dear.
- Thank you very much.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.639
When can your little prince
come to bed with you?

30:15.800 --> 30:18.030
I'll wash your mouth out with soap!

30:18.200 --> 30:19.474
You don't think so?

30:20.080 --> 30:22.196
Such behavior!

30:24.720 --> 30:26.153
Get lost, Giudizio!

30:26.320 --> 30:28.754
It was really lovely,
and I had a good cry!

30:28.960 --> 30:32.589
Romanesque, 13th century,
perfect condition.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.712
Mullion window...
Excuse me. I'll continue later.

30:41.080 --> 30:45.676
Lallo, read the telegram
White Feather got from Stockholm.

30:46.120 --> 30:49.954
"Come immediately. I cannot live
without you. Inge."

30:50.120 --> 30:52.839
Is she the bucktoothed one
from last summer?

30:53.000 --> 30:56.834
Are you going?
Lll be cold up there now!

31:00.560 --> 31:04.951
If I put a bullet between their eyes,
they'd call me a murderer!

31:05.520 --> 31:07.875
I'd throw them all in quicklime!

31:12.040 --> 31:13.837
Get the hell out of here!

31:15.000 --> 31:18.993
- What about my mother?
- I couldn't leave Mom for buckteeth.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.550
Look at Madam's new girls.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.992
Just look!

31:36.480 --> 31:38.471
See that big one with the hat?

31:38.840 --> 31:40.398
A dead man dancing!

31:42.760 --> 31:44.113
Can I ride with you?

31:44.760 --> 31:46.034
Here I am!

31:50.080 --> 31:53.117
I have the sacred right
of a place in the sun...

31:53.320 --> 31:56.312
He was a handsome man,
a lot like Wallace Beery.

31:56.480 --> 32:00.109
Do you remember? With that beard,
he looked like a French duke.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.275
Thas a great load!

32:52.840 --> 32:54.512
Scureza!

33:13.800 --> 33:16.394
Good night, King vittorio.
Good night everybody!

33:18.560 --> 33:22.678
This is the Victory Monument
we used to visit every day.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.512
I dreamt about it at night too.

33:28.760 --> 33:31.115
- I'm going, Mom.
- Make a good confession.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.714
If you've had a drink,
you can't receive Communion.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.519
You can drink, but you can't eat.

33:36.680 --> 33:40.719
You can't drink either.
And tell him you're a delinquent.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.916
- That you make your parents angry.
- Yes.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.355
- That you answer back.
- Yes.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.080
And that you curse.
Everything, understand?

33:48.240 --> 33:49.673
- Bye, Mom.
- Everything!

33:54.400 --> 33:55.992
Who's the first?

34:10.360 --> 34:12.873
- When did you last confess?
- Christmas.

34:13.040 --> 34:17.112
- Shame on you. Do you go to Mass?
- Not when I've got the mumps.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.668
- Do you honor your parents?
- Oh, yes.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.027
Not like that! White flowers
on one side, yellow on the other.

34:25.199 --> 34:28.556
Is not the same thing.
Is all a matter of aesthetics.

34:28.719 --> 34:30.438
I understand.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.995
Well, do you honor your parents?

34:33.159 --> 34:37.199
Oh, yes, but they don't honor me.
They beat me.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.397
You must annoy them.
Do you tell lies?

34:40.560 --> 34:43.472
- I have to.
- Do you covet what belongs to others?

34:43.639 --> 34:46.393
The small flowers
in the small vases.

34:47.239 --> 34:48.514
What do you covet?

34:48.679 --> 34:52.514
My pal Bragger's got a raincoat
with a lot of metal buckles...

34:52.679 --> 34:56.831
...like the one the detective has in
the William Powell-Myrna Loy films.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.230
Do you commit impure acts?
Do you touch yourself?

34:59.400 --> 35:02.915
Do you know Saint Louis cries
when you touch yourself?

35:06.240 --> 35:09.277
Go ahead, cry.
I'm not going to say whether I do...

35:09.440 --> 35:13.228
...because you'll only tell my dad.
Don't say you don't touch yourself.

35:13.800 --> 35:17.156
How can you not touch yourself
when you see the tobacconist...

35:17.320 --> 35:20.471
...as stacked as she is,
when she says:

35:20.640 --> 35:22.596
Export brand?

35:23.840 --> 35:28.072
And the math teacher who looks
just like a lion?

35:28.240 --> 35:29.958
Holy Mother of God.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.908
How can you not touch yourself
when she looks at you that way?

35:35.640 --> 35:38.279
What do you think we come to see
on St. Anthony's day...

35:38.440 --> 35:42.513
...when there's the blessing
of the animals, the sheep's butts?

35:43.760 --> 35:48.231
Olindo! I have a flat tire!
Would you pass me the pump?

36:03.240 --> 36:07.836
There. See how he's looking at me?
How can I tell him about Volpina...

36:08.000 --> 36:11.675
...and that time when she asked me
to fix her bike tires.

36:14.560 --> 36:19.315
Did you know people kissed that way,
with tongues going in and out?

36:19.480 --> 36:22.836
I ask the questions, not you.
Go on.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.834
Then, there's Gradisca.
Last summer...

36:27.000 --> 36:29.070
...I saw her going into the cinema.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.708
Because... You see...

36:31.880 --> 36:34.599
...l'm crazy about Gradisca.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.512
I want a wife like her.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.152
She was alone.

36:42.920 --> 36:45.718
She was there, in front of me.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.591
I changed seats.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.354
I changed seats again...

37:03.640 --> 37:05.471
...then again.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.749
And finally...

37:36.440 --> 37:37.793
Looking for something?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.070
I sat there like an asshole.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.470
I wanted to jump in the harbor.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.513
But Father Balosa
can't understand such things.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.910
So since I had to
tell him something...

37:48.080 --> 37:51.629
...I would say that I touched
myself once, just a little...

37:51.800 --> 37:53.950
...and that I repented immediately.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.033
He was happy with that.

37:56.200 --> 38:00.079
He gave me three our Fathers,
Hail Marys and Glorias and that was it.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.716
Three Our Fathers, Hail Marys
and Glorias.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.878
Do you touch yourself?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.837
Look at those rings under your eyes!

38:15.000 --> 38:17.230
Yes, you do.
You touch yourself.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.437
Yes, just once in the garage.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.388
Enough!

38:22.560 --> 38:24.835
- Why?
- Always touching me.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.479
- Jean Harlow!
- Gradisca!

38:32.640 --> 38:34.790
The tobacconiss tits!

38:34.960 --> 38:36.678
- The girl at the circus!
- Which one?

38:36.840 --> 38:40.071
- The one in the fishnet!
- Aldina!

38:40.240 --> 38:43.152
No. Aldina's mine!
I'll smash your face!

39:00.760 --> 39:03.638
- Platoons, stand at attention!
- Platoon...

39:03.840 --> 39:05.353
...attention!

39:05.520 --> 39:09.433
- Platoon, attention!
- Platoon, attention!

39:35.280 --> 39:37.032
There he is! There he is!

40:08.440 --> 40:10.795
Comrades!

40:10.960 --> 40:13.235
Salute the duce!

40:13.400 --> 40:17.712
We hail the duce with grateful
hearts and the Fascist salute!

40:19.760 --> 40:22.672
The greeting of lmperial Rome...

40:23.280 --> 40:25.157
...which shows us...

40:26.280 --> 40:29.909
...the path of destiny to be followed
by Fascist Italy.

40:46.600 --> 40:50.036
Let me touch him!
I want to touch him!

40:50.200 --> 40:53.670
Long live the duce!
Wonderful duce!

41:17.360 --> 41:21.069
Ninety-nine percent of the population
carry the party card.

41:21.240 --> 41:24.516
We have 1200 Young Fascists,
3000 Young Italian Girls...

41:24.680 --> 41:27.672
...and 4000 Sons of the She-Wolf.
- We're a single Fascist heart...

41:27.840 --> 41:30.115
...but the work on the sea front
needs hurrying up.

41:30.280 --> 41:35.673
This marvelous enthusiasm makes us
young but so ancient at the same time.

41:35.840 --> 41:39.150
Young because fascism
has rejuvenated our blood...

41:39.320 --> 41:41.436
...with shining ideals that are
very ancient.

41:41.600 --> 41:46.151
All I can say is,
Mussolini's got balls this big!

41:48.000 --> 41:52.039
Today, April 21, we celebrate
the birth of Rome, the eternal city.

41:52.200 --> 41:55.829
What does that mean? It means
we must respect the monuments...

41:56.000 --> 41:59.072
...the ruins that Rome has left us.

41:59.240 --> 42:04.030
That is what I am doing,
despite being harassed at night.

42:12.920 --> 42:17.630
Why don't we see
on this glorious, sun-filled day...

42:18.160 --> 42:21.072
...the Italian sun, to which
no one can apply sanctions...

42:21.240 --> 42:23.993
...is a divine sign that the heavens
are on our side!

42:24.480 --> 42:25.993
Miranda.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.077
- Who locked the gate?
- I did!

42:31.240 --> 42:32.832
- Why?
- You know why!

42:33.000 --> 42:34.399
Come here, open it.

42:34.560 --> 42:37.950
Listen to the noise they're making
in the square since this morning.

42:38.120 --> 42:42.511
- Open up. I have things to do!
- You're staying at home!

42:42.680 --> 42:45.831
Take this off! If I want to be a widow,
I'll kill you myself.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.195
I'll strangle you with your neckerchief!

42:48.360 --> 42:51.955
Think I'm scared of those
black-shirted lice?

42:52.120 --> 42:53.792
Give me the key. Come on.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.639
Give me the key! Miranda!

42:56.960 --> 42:58.188
Goddamn it!

42:58.360 --> 43:04.117
Why is it that every time there's
a demonstration with those assholes...

43:04.280 --> 43:07.238
...I have to stay home!
Is unheard of!

43:07.520 --> 43:09.511
One, two...

43:09.680 --> 43:11.272
...three, four...

43:11.760 --> 43:13.716
...five, six...

43:13.880 --> 43:15.711
...seven, eight.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.431
These youth are sturdy as rocks!

43:22.600 --> 43:24.875
Yes, yes, sturdy as rocks!

43:25.600 --> 43:31.118
One, two, three, four...

43:31.280 --> 43:35.796
...five, six, seven.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.316
Hail to the duce!

43:50.360 --> 43:52.954
Hail to the duce! Hail to the duce!

43:57.760 --> 44:00.877
Young Fascist, Ciccio Marconi...

44:01.040 --> 44:06.831
...do you wish to marry
Young Italian, Aldina Cordini?

44:07.040 --> 44:11.192
And you, Young Italian,
Aldina Cordini...

44:11.360 --> 44:16.309
...do you wish to marry
Young Fascist, Ciccio Marconi?

44:16.480 --> 44:18.914
Way to go, Ciccio! Long live Ciccio!

44:36.480 --> 44:39.233
Comrades, they say bread and work...

44:39.400 --> 44:42.437
...but wouldn't bread and a glass
of wine be better?

44:50.520 --> 44:52.670
- A Fernet.
- A coffee!

44:52.840 --> 44:54.910
- Fernet!
- A soft drink.

44:55.680 --> 44:58.797
For our comrade, the federale!
Three cheers!

45:06.720 --> 45:09.473
Difficult shot!

45:10.040 --> 45:12.918
- Difficult shot!
- A difficult shot, Your Excellency!

45:24.520 --> 45:27.159
I wouldn't like to go up against him!

45:35.360 --> 45:37.999
- Who turned off the lights?
- Attilio, light a candle.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.434
Light the candle.

45:41.160 --> 45:43.913
There's a gramophone
playing up there.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.150
There's a gramophone
playing up there.

45:46.320 --> 45:49.596
- What the hell are you saying?
- There's a gramophone up there.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.518
Silence!

45:51.680 --> 45:53.591
Thas the "Internazionale"!

45:53.760 --> 45:56.115
- What is it?
- The hymn of subversives.

45:57.160 --> 46:00.755
- Where is it? Where is it coming from?
- Where are you hiding?

46:01.400 --> 46:02.992
Is incredible!

46:03.880 --> 46:07.475
You coward! Coward!
Show yourself, coward!

46:11.440 --> 46:13.476
We await your orders, sir!

46:15.000 --> 46:18.151
Everyone is to go home!

46:19.480 --> 46:20.959
Close the windows!

46:21.120 --> 46:23.554
You there, close the window!

46:23.960 --> 46:27.794
- Get inside!
- Go home!

46:31.280 --> 46:33.953
What are you doing there?
Hurry, go home!

46:49.960 --> 46:52.520
Hey! He's up there!

46:53.640 --> 46:57.155
- Come on, les go home.
- He's in the bell tower!

47:36.160 --> 47:38.754
Beware! Beware!

47:38.920 --> 47:42.879
Beware, we are Fascists
The terror of the communists

47:43.040 --> 47:46.794
We are the members of the Fascist party

47:46.960 --> 47:51.954
The cause we will follow until our death
And in a fight we'll always be our best

47:52.120 --> 47:53.439
GOD MOTHERLAND FAMILY

48:12.320 --> 48:14.390
You're free to go.

48:14.560 --> 48:19.429
You can go home. You see?
The Fascists aren't all that bad.

48:19.600 --> 48:23.479
We didn't even harm a single hair.

48:23.920 --> 48:26.992
We almost offered you coffee as well.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.355
Good night, sonny boy!

48:31.960 --> 48:34.030
Bring him here.

48:47.480 --> 48:49.232
Take your hat off.

48:49.560 --> 48:53.189
I'm sorry, is a habit, even at home...

48:53.640 --> 48:55.756
Why don't you use
the Roman style of greeting?

48:56.720 --> 48:59.837
I didn't know it was mandatory.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.355
I don't know anything about politics.

49:02.760 --> 49:04.591
Have a seat!

49:05.160 --> 49:07.628
So you don't know anything
about politics!

49:08.160 --> 49:11.038
Yet you have been heard to say:

49:12.000 --> 49:15.595
"If Mussolini continues like this,
I really don't know."

49:16.560 --> 49:19.711
What do you mean by
"I really don't know"?

49:19.880 --> 49:21.154
Well...

49:21.320 --> 49:23.595
...I never said anything like that.

49:23.760 --> 49:26.149
I generally only talk about my work.

49:26.320 --> 49:30.836
Perhaps I said I really don't know
about politics, how it works.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.992
- Is that a threat?
- Certainly not!

49:34.160 --> 49:37.311
- Lack of faith in Fascism?
- No, why?

49:37.920 --> 49:42.311
- Subversive propaganda, perhaps?
- No, there's no reason for it.

49:44.920 --> 49:48.037
And you know nothing
about the gramophone?

49:50.000 --> 49:53.356
- The gramophone?
- Don't get smart with me! Answer!

49:54.800 --> 50:00.318
I was asleep. They woke me.
I didn't even have time to put my tie on.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.039
Your tie or your anarchiss neckerchief?

50:06.680 --> 50:09.148
No. What neckerchief?

50:13.120 --> 50:17.955
Would you like to drink a toast
to the victory of Fascism?

50:19.160 --> 50:21.276
Well, really, at this time...

50:21.480 --> 50:23.994
"At this time." "At this time!"

50:25.160 --> 50:28.914
Damn fools!
Trying our patience this way!

50:29.080 --> 50:32.595
- You must drink to a Fascist victory.
- Why do we have to crack your skulls...

50:32.760 --> 50:36.036
...to make you understand
that Fascism...

50:36.200 --> 50:39.909
...is for your protection,
for your dignity, your courage!

50:40.080 --> 50:43.311
- Go to hell, you ignorant animals!
- Drink.

50:46.520 --> 50:48.795
- This is castor oil.
- You're not drinking it?

50:48.960 --> 50:53.078
No, I'm not drinking it. Why should I?
What have I done?

50:55.480 --> 50:59.314
What are you doing?
Leave me alone! What are you doing?

51:00.040 --> 51:02.793
Be good! Open your mouth!

51:02.960 --> 51:06.748
Open your mouth!
Don't make me angry!

51:07.080 --> 51:09.833
Drink it down, ill do you good!

51:10.000 --> 51:14.676
Just look at the state he's in,
a man of his age. Is shameful!

51:15.640 --> 51:18.871
What are you doing,
vomiting on my shoes?

51:19.040 --> 51:22.237
This is what saddens us...

51:22.400 --> 51:25.597
...this utter refusal to understand.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.034
Why?

51:27.200 --> 51:29.634
- Kids take it when they're sick.
- Why, I ask?

51:29.800 --> 51:31.950
And you're sick in the head!

51:32.400 --> 51:36.029
Have some more.
It will clear your ideas!

51:36.920 --> 51:39.480
- You'll pay for this!
- Well, just send us the bill.

51:40.880 --> 51:43.269
Good heavens, is 2:00!

51:46.760 --> 51:48.432
Aurelio!

51:54.360 --> 51:56.351
Whas happened?

52:21.560 --> 52:25.109
You won't listen to me!

52:26.600 --> 52:28.192
You'll see!

52:36.360 --> 52:38.032
Get up.

52:41.640 --> 52:43.517
Dry yourself.

52:47.440 --> 52:49.715
Don't catch cold.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.395
- Dad!
- Go to bed.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.596
Go to bed!

52:58.840 --> 53:01.673
God, that stinks, Dad!

53:04.000 --> 53:08.232
If the person who squealed
is who I think it is...

53:08.400 --> 53:11.278
...he'd better move
to another continent...

53:11.440 --> 53:15.718
...because I'll eat his guts!
I'll eat his balls!

53:16.760 --> 53:18.910
Traitorous son of a bitch!

53:24.440 --> 53:29.230
The Grand Hotel.
I call her the "Old Lady."

53:29.400 --> 53:34.155
I come here every year
to sip the nectar of love.

53:34.320 --> 53:37.551
I give kindness, and I yearn for kindness.

53:37.720 --> 53:40.518
I'm the only one in town
to visit the Grand Hotel.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.716
They say Gradisca was here once.

53:42.880 --> 53:46.793
It was because of that highly
improbable adventure...

53:46.960 --> 53:49.599
...that she came
to be called Gradisca.

53:49.760 --> 53:53.036
Her real name is Ninola.
But they say that three years ago...

53:53.240 --> 53:56.915
...one winter night...
- Don't let us down, Ninola!

53:57.080 --> 53:59.548
The prince is a handsome man,
you know?

53:59.720 --> 54:04.430
If he looks like he's satisfied,
mention the work on the harbor.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.909
It will only take a word from him.

54:07.080 --> 54:09.548
Be polite, speak proper Italian.

54:09.720 --> 54:12.473
He's a real prince,
not just any old moron.

54:12.640 --> 54:16.918
Is a great opportunity for you too.
The harbor.

57:31.080 --> 57:33.514
Mr. Prince, sir...

57:34.880 --> 57:37.075
Gradisca. Help yourself!

57:38.280 --> 57:40.919
Thas how Ninola
came to be called Gradisca.

57:41.080 --> 57:43.674
I don't think there's a lot
of truth in this story.

57:43.840 --> 57:46.718
Nor in everything that Biscein says.

57:46.880 --> 57:50.759
He's a habitual liar.
He invents a new one each day.

57:50.920 --> 57:55.835
You must know that two years back
an emir arrived with 30 concubines.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.116
I was there. I saw him arrive.

58:49.840 --> 58:51.159
Baldassar.

58:59.160 --> 59:00.832
What? You'll break the camera!

59:40.720 --> 59:44.474
The emir locked all 30 rooms
every night.

59:44.640 --> 59:49.760
Yes, that is quite true, but the rest
of Biscein's story has many holes in it.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.516
The silly man claims
that on that very night...

59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.195
Beans, olives,
toasted melon seeds!

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.833
Here I am! Here I am, girls!

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.038
Come on, Biscein!

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.270
Come on, Biscein!

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.158
Come on, Biscein!

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.234
Sweet Jesus, the pussy!

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.118
Yes! Yes!

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.239
I polished them all off. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven...

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.437
He claims, making no distinction
between the beautiful and ugly...

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.194
...he polished off 28 of them
that night!

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.074
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle!

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.592
Are you Polish? Because only Poles
have this fire in their eyes.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.478
My uncle dances very well!

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:14.513
Commander! Ladies!

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.832
Then you must be Czech!

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.833
Because only Czech women
have this fire in their eyes.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.274
I know Italian:

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.433
Good evening.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.279
- Uncle! Uncle!
- Out! Get out of here!

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.993
Jesus, the asshole waiter.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.071
Asshole, asshole, asshole...

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.990
- Have you seen the sea?
- The sea?

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.277
Come and take a walk with me.
Les go!

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.833
Leopardi wrote poetry.
Do you know Leopardi?

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.828
No, this is my first time here.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:51.794
Dante Alighieri here.
Leopardi here, or even here!

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.030
Oh, good!

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.593
Skol!

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.594
Lallo, how did it go?

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.117
Fine. I never had problems
with the Germans.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.830
She's really fallen for me.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:25.833
And to prove it, she even
offered me posterior intimacy.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.550
Uncle! Uncle!

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.710
Uncle Teo was Daďs brother.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.156
We went to take him for a ride
every month in the summer.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.351
Uncle! He's coming, Dad.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.199
He's coming.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.511
Hello, Uncle!

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.432
- How's it going, Teo?
- He's happy, Mom.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.632
- He's looking well.
- Yes, he's looking well.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.159
- Let me through.
- Watch your step.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.714
Here he is.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.589
- Hi, Uncle! How are you?
- And how are you?

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.399
I'm fine. I go to school.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.314
Guess where we're taking you today.
To eat passatelli at the farm!

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.677
Is my brother happy?

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.479
And look, Daďs here too. Yes!

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.315
Handsome son of mine.
Give your dad a kiss.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.431
- Is he doing better?
- He's normal.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.075
Look how he's grown.
He's in fifth grade.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.514
Teo, how are you?

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.671
And Tino got so drunk the other night.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.231
- How are you, Teo?
- I'm doing fine. I'm much better.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.391
- Mom, the pastries!
- Here they are.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.313
Uncle, Mom brought you pastries.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.515
Well, we'll be back before evening.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.709
- Here, have a cigar on me.
- Thanks.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.950
Sit here next to your dad.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.590
Is Father Pazzaglia still alive?

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.115
Well, he's been dead 10 years now.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.038
He's been gone for quite a long time!

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.749
- He was alive last year.
- That was Father Amedeo.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.636
- Is he dead as well?
- No, Father Amedeo is alive.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.435
Exactly, thas what I was saying.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.160
I saw him last year with
a vase full of flowers.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.279
He was walking and walking.
I wonder where he was going.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.593
Teo was a bright lad when he was 8.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.751
I don't want to offend you, Aurelio...

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.753
...but Teo was smarter than you
at school.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.799
- He was smarter at everything.
- I can admit that.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.428
Is the truth. He still is, even now.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.160
Do you like being with us, Teo?

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.349
Uncle, the sea's over there.
Is like a blue streak.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.959
- Dad, can I drive the horse?
- No.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.993
What can I do just sitting here then?
Let me drive it!

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.119
It would be the first time a horse
was driven by a mule!

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.512
Isn't it faster that way?

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:32.071
Is an awful road, full of potholes,
enough to take this carriage.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.750
- What is it? Something wrong?
- Leave him.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.590
Why do you carry those in your pocket?

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.111
The stones.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.839
- Aren't they heavy?
- But they're beautiful, stones are.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.751
Yes! Stop the carriage, Tino!
Stop! Stop!

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.399
- What did he say?
- What is it now?

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.836
- Teo needs to take a leak.
- Well, if he has to.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.037
Watch how you get down.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.676
- You too?
- Yes. Why?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.399
Don't be long, Grandpa, I'm hungry.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.399
My father's father used to say:

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.836
"To be fit as a fiddle, you have to piddle!

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.912
To be fit as a frog, pee often like a dog."

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.149
How green! How wonderful, Teo.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.956
- How old is the mare?
- Three years and two months.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.999
She's only got one vice.
She can't stand train whistles.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.075
When I'm at the station stand
I have to bend backwards to hold her!

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.198
- What will you feed her today?
- A plate of cappelletti.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.395
Hey, you forgot to unbutton your fly!

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.835
Dad! Uncle pissed in his pants!

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.951
Goddamn!

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.072
They said he was normal!

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:02.555
He didn't undo his fly!

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.109
He forgot.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:10.035
Is really true. The sea looks
like a blue streak. A long one.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.397
- Uncle, you pissed in your pants!
- Shut up!

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.790
He didn't open the shop!

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:19.591
It doesn't matter.
You can change at the farm.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.718
Titta!

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.917
Come here or I'll throw myself
under the wheels!

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:29.151
Sit down, you criminal!

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:32.948
- Shall we move on, sir?
- Yes, les go.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.234
And even today
we had a good meal!

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:47.960
You all go and see the spring.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.874
My son Teo and I will stay here
and have a nice glass of wine.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.237
Fine, but only one more glass.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.393
You know what I'll do?
I'll have a little nap.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.112
Good. It won't do you any harm
here in the shade.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.874
The egg's lovely, isn't it, Teo?

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:12.319
I'm like that too. When I see an egg,
I could look at it for hours.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.519
I ask myself, how can nature manage
to make things so perfect?

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.759
God made nature,
not an ignorant fool like you!

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:24.470
Oh, don't bust my chops! See you later.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.392
I'm counting on you, Dad.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.597
Menghino, how far away is this...?

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.073
How far away is this spring?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.878
Uncle, look. I'm hypnotizing it.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.319
Oliva!

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.639
Oliva, there's a toad!
It looks like Father Balosa!

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.074
Fly, baby, fly!

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.311
- How is it?
- Fantastic!

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.311
And it won't give you a hangover.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.391
- We'll put it here.
- Good idea.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.398
Throw that stone away!

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.717
You naughty little boy!

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.838
I know what your name is,
you delinquent!

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.836
- Dad.
- What is it?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.197
Uncle Teo went up a tree!

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.909
- Whas that? Whas he shouting?
- I can't understand.

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.629
Uncle Teo went up a tree!

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.950
I want a woman!

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.831
I want a woman!

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.989
I want a woman!

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.272
But where am I going
to get you a woman, my boy?

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.238
- What woman are you talking about?
- Your uncle's up there.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.550
I want a woman!

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.830
There he is! Up there, Dad!

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.911
Any nests up there, Uncle?

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.117
Come on, Teo.
Come down. You'll hurt yourself.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.475
Don't just stand there! Go get a ladder!

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.269
Is this how you keep an eye on him?
How did he get up there?

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.714
I'll go up, Dad.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.519
I will hammer you into the ground
with my fist!

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.558
I want a woman!

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.119
How did he get up there? If he falls,
he'll break every bone in his body.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.352
Miranda, go indoors and stop
with the drama.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.829
- What drama?
- How did this happen?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.549
We were having a drink with Tino here,
and next thing I knew...

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.314
I didn't even see him.
He shot up there like a cat.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.040
What are you doing?
Throwing stones at your old dad!

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.112
Teo, come down. Thas enough!

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.995
I'll kill myself! Goddamn it!

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.435
Now, now, Aurelio, don't be like that.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.239
Come down, Teo, your brother's angry!

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.231
Don't be silly, now. Come down.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.518
I want a woman!

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.390
Is quite a normal urge. He's 42!

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.792
- Yes, but he'll fall down.
- When I was 42...

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.954
I'm telling you!

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.190
Now thas enough. Climb down.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.511
- Climb down, Teo!
- Don't forget about the nest, Uncle.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.513
Menghino's coming up.

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.152
Good shot, Uncle! Right on his head!

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.998
- My head!
- You hit the bull's-eye!

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.833
Now I'll come up,
but don't throw anything at me!

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.312
We'll take some birds home...

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.392
- What is this?
- It hurts!

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.472
- Do you want to kill us all?
- I'm coming up.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:45.118
Yes, sir! If you throw one at me,
you'll hear about it.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.628
What a shot!

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.429
This guy is a murderer!
May somebody kick you in the nuts!

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.637
I want a woman!

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.510
Christ, what will I do now?
What will I do? Jerk off?

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.075
I'm an asshole.
An asshole, a stupid asshole!

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.794
Les all go home then.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.838
Tino, hitch up the horse.
We're going home!

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.958
Come on, les go home.
Everybody, home!

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.272
- Are you going to leave him up there?
- Yes! Hitch up the horse. Les go!

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:26.069
- As you wish.
- Dad! Titta!

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.595
Call your mother! Where's your mother?!

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.990
- You're leaving him there?
- He's good up there.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.958
- Les go! I want to go home.
- But he's my son!

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.795
- Aurelio, listen to me.
- I want a woman!

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.839
Teo, you see? We're going. Come down!

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.070
- Dad, les go!
- But he's sick.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.231
We're just pretending. Hurry up!

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.029
Listen, Aurelio. Send me up there.
I'll talk to him.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:53.077
He'll come down, you'll see.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.389
Everybody! Get in the carriage.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.873
- But Aurelio...
- We're leaving right away. Get in.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.313
Teo, what are you doing?
Are you going to stay here?

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.596
We're going now. Is late.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.276
Is getting dark.
Who will take you back?

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.595
You want to stay up there?
All right then, bye!

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.118
Maybe we can scare him with the rifle.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.071
Come down!

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.112
Teo, Holy Mother of God!
Are you going to come down or not?

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.278
Look, we're leaving! Go!

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.912
- Teo, come down! Teo!
- Goodbye, Uncle!

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.232
- I want a woman!
- Uncle will kill us all today.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.912
Come on, everybody out!
Get out now! No questions!

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.832
What are you crying about?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.753
Tino, run to the hospital
and call the attendants.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.071
And come back right away,
or I'll throw myself down the well!

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.119
What are you crying about?
Is a big laugh, is all just comic!

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.949
I want a woman!

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.876
Listen to him, Miranda. Poor lad.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.436
Do you feel better?

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:57.909
I want a woman!

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.551
I can't stand it anymore! I can't!
Make him shut up!

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.790
- Dad? Dad!
- I've had enough!

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:17.111
- What do you want?
- Shall I go and call volpina?

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.958
Dad, look!

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.917
Mom, they've arrived.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.077
- Good evening, doctor.
- Whas happened?

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.152
- He's up the tree.
- Nice place. Fresh air.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.835
- Is this all yours?
- Is only an old farm.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.029
- He's been up there for five hours!
- Where?

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.794
Up there. You can't see him now
because of the foliage.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.757
- What have you done to him?
- Nothing.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.150
He's been shouting and throwing stones.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.471
I hope he won't be like this
his whole life, doctor.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.676
A dwarf nun! Look!

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:03.915
- Ill be bad for him and worse for us.
- Relax, sir, she'll take care of it.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.159
Were you getting a bit of air?

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.396
Is she going up?

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.189
Come down! I'm not going
to play these damn, silly games!

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.955
Jesus, just look at that!
She got him to come down!

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.510
She got him down, and he's quite happy.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.076
Teo. Teo.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.437
Here he is.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.876
So have you been up
to your tricks again?

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.871
- No.
- What were you doing up there?

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.112
Counting how many stones
fig trees grow in this season.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.113
Go home. Go home. Take him home.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.759
Some days he's normal. Some days
he isn't. Just like the rest of us.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.996
- Bye, Uncle!
- Oh, Titta. Take care.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.400
You can see Gigino's place
from up there.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.394
Is been a long time since I saw him.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.473
Between 11:00 and midnight.
Yes, with Caghetta's boat.

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.597
Is 30 stories high
and has 16 smokestacks.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:22.469
Think what a pirate could do
with a ship like that!

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.834
Come here!
Call your son, will you?

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.960
Where's Ronald Coleman?
I don't see him.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.719
Gradisca's here! Gradisca!

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.269
Hurray for Gradisca!
Hurray for Gradisca!

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.759
Your steamboat is here.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.319
Climb aboard!

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.438
Severino!

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.398
Where are all these people going?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.709
Where are they going with hearts
all pounding?

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.958
Where are they going?

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.756
Today is a very important day
for our country, for our motherland...

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.269
- Come on, we're off! Les go.
- I'm here!

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.795
If you drop me,
you owe me a new dress.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.793
I'd like to tell you, but I can't...

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.272
...because is all still in the air.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.750
Where are these people going,
toward the open sea?

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.512
Enough, Giudizio!

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.753
- How far out will it be?
- Five miles.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.912
But thanks to Galileo, it will
seem like 400 yards to us.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.308
Marvelous!

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.357
Lll be like
is coming straight at us.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.152
Mr. Lawyer, how much will it weigh?

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.229
Two and a half times the weight
of the Grand Hotel.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.311
Plus the Arch of Augustus!

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.917
- On the sea...
- Go thou, queen of the sea

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.389
Thou passeth and thy destiny

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.313
I shall follow in the waves

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:38.950
Watching the glistening wake

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:43.879
Get closer to your mother. And you,
ma'am, a little closer to your son.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:48.671
Holy shit, guys!
The water's really freezing!

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:53.799
My nuts have shriveled
to the size of two dried beans.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.473
- You swam out from shore?
- What do you think?

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.556
Freestyle.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:09.875
I want to dance with you

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.108
All night like this...

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:19.115
The third day I went there
with my boat, whistled as usual...

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.718
...and out came the dolphin.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:25.634
He put his head on the boat.
It looked at me and said, "Mama!"

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.119
Get the fuck out of here!

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.353
Is true. Dolphins are intelligent,
even my dentist said so.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.354
Look how many there are.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.876
Millions and millions
and millions of stars.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.678
Jesus, you guys!

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.913
I wonder how the hell everything can
stay up there in place.

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.191
Is pretty simple for us.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.557
If we have to build a house,
so many bricks, so much time...

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.395
...but up there, sweet Jesus,
where do you put the foundations?

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.074
They aren't just confetti,
you know!

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.317
Miranda. Are you asleep?

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:04.754
Answer me!

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.751
- Are you cold? Want my jacket?
- What?

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.797
- Go ahead, take it.
- I don't want it.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.919
Come on, put it around your shoulders
or you'll get a chill and complain.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.435
Is this going to take much longer?
Is 1:00.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.034
How would I know?
They said id be around midnight.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.317
Even if is late, is coming
from America, you know.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:26.392
- Go fuck yourselves, all of you!
- What a friend.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.230
He sent you his best wishes.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:38.316
Every time I was full of hope,
but it never came to anything.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.512
And now...

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.600
- Do you know how old I am?
- 52?

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.591
I'm not ashamed to tell the truth.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.911
In fact, I always add
a few years on.

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.230
- I'm 30.
- Thas surprising, my darling.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.551
- I haven't given up hope.
- I thought you were 27 or 28.

01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:00.840
I want one of those long encounters
that last a lifetime.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:05.793
I want a family, children, a husband...

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.273
...to chat with in the evening
at supper, maybe...

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:14.433
...and to make love with now and then,
because thas important too.

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.752
But affection is perhaps
even more necessary than love.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.237
I'm so full of affection.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.639
But who can I lavish it on, who wants it?

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.759
Why are you crying?
Look at the silly girl, she's crying!

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.869
She cries because the girl is delicate
and sensitive, oh, yes!

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.314
I'll be here for you!

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:40.315
- She's right! Men are all the same!
- Don't cry, my darling!

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.958
- Here it is!
- Dad, Dad!

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:08.197
The Rex! The Rex!

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:13.152
Hurray for the Rex! The greatest
thing the regime has built!

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:20.070
As the representative of the Podesta,
I wish you a safe journey!

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.468
Long live Italy!

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.235
- Come and buy from Biscein!
- Whas it like?

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.833
Whas it like?

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.718
Whas it like? Whas it like?

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.916
So long!

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.312
Hey!

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.595
Just look at this!

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.754
Can't see a thing!

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:31.718
I'll just keep to the wall.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:36.030
The last fog like this was in '22.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.517
Careful now, stop.
There's a man here!

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.039
Damn you. Is unbelievable!

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.756
Gina!

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.595
Gina!

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.435
Where am I?

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.037
I don't seem to be anywhere.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.313
If death is like this...

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.153
...I don't think much of it.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.669
Everything's gone.
People, trees...

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.912
...birds in the air, wine...

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.757
Up yours!

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.913
Tino!

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.432
I can't even find my house.
Where am I?

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.758
What do you mean?
You are in front of your house.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.353
Is there.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.110
Thank you!

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.271
- Where are you going in all this fog?
- To school. Bye, Grandpa.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.712
Would you look at that.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.678
I was in Norway.

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.752
Two women.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.391
Beautiful, huge Norwegians!

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.995
Beans, olives,
toasted melon seeds!

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.274
Hey!

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:44.113
Is open, you can get in.

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.635
Last one in is a queer!

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:50.108
Naso, this way, take a look at this.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:02.868
Look!

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.039
Is gorgeous!

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.150
Where are you, my love?

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:55.031
- Number 25. varzi, you're God!
- Is Brilliperi.

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:01.512
- It was number 18.
- 18. Campari!

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.750
Aldina, do you know who it was?

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:08.312
- We know, it was Campari.
- I knew him in the race at Monza.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.834
FINISH

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.159
Aldina!

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.992
- Lallo!
- Where are you going?

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.230
Be careful, Lallo!

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.919
- What is it?
- An ear.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.230
Look, an ear!

01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.757
Can I come in?

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.480
- I'm closed.
- Can I come in, miss?

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.471
- Good evening.
- What do you want?

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.870
One cigarette.

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:13.352
- Can I help you?
- You couldn't manage.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.317
What do you mean?

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:18.677
I can lift 176 pounds.
I can even lift my father.

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.637
Thas a good one!

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.109
- Why not? How much do you weigh?
- I don't know.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:29.914
- I bet I could lift you too.
- Oh, yeah?

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.912
Les see you.

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:52.789
- Look, I really can.
- Les see.

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.272
I'll fall down!

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.151
You silly boy, let me go,
put me down!

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.356
- I did it!
- Why, you're strong!

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.994
See? Now, I'll lift you again.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.151
- I don't believe you.
- Look.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.036
Hey, thas enough now.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.559
Put me down.

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.277
- Because I always...
- I told you to stop.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.910
...thought you were...
- What are you doing? You'll let me fall!

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:34.470
- You crazy boy! Put me down!
...to die for!

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.870
You really are crazy, you know!

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.918
Whas happened to me?
My head!

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.914
See how many times I did it?

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:51.917
Oh, yes. Yes, my little darling.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.278
Come here.
You're a nice one too, you know?

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:01.990
Drive me crazy.
Drive me crazy, just a little.

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.469
- What should I do?
- Suck. Suck!

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.432
Come on.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.508
You can have this one too.

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:17.838
Don't blow! Suck!

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.719
- Is this right?
- No, no.

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.830
My love. My love.

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:26.994
You have to suck, stupid!

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.991
- What are you doing?
- I can't...!

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.149
- I can't breath!
- Leave me alone.

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.834
Get out now.
I've got to close up.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:38.638
What was it you wanted?
One cigarette?

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:42.110
Here. I'll give it to you for free.
Now, beat it!

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.633
Thank you.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:52.478
- I can't do it.
- Get out of the way.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.598
- Come on, get out.
- Good night.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.195
Come on, drink it. Ill do you good.

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:10.033
- Is hot!
- It has to be hot.

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.313
There's a fly.

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:31.438
- Where is it?
- Is there. Over there.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.353
It was there.

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.593
The only house with flies during winter.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.196
How did it happen with you and Dad?

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:46.433
- What?
- How did you meet, fall in love...

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.795
...get married?

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.671
Whas all this about?
Anyway, who remembers?

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:59.071
Your daďs not a great one
for compliments.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.232
He was a laborer at Saludecio...

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:07.349
...and my folks, who had a bit of money,
didn't think much of him.

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.869
In fact... Well...

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:16.750
...we eloped without saying
a single word to anyone.

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:20.113
When did he give you your first kiss?

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.108
What kind of question is that?

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.312
Anyway, I don't even know
whether there was one.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:32.033
The first time we saw each other
he raised his hat, and thas all.

01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:35.319
It was the most one could do
in those days.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:40.190
Is not like that now,
when you do all kinds of things.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.592
- But I never do anything, Mom!
- Stay covered. You're all sweaty.

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.752
What do you want?
You're still in short pants.

01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:51.674
Well, get me some long ones then,
like the other kid!

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:54.718
What other kid? Gina!

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:57.110
She told me not to send
any more love letters.

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.316
- And I said, "Why?"
- Take the bicycle...

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.313
...and tell the doctor to come sooner.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.994
Get him to examine you as well.
I'm worried.

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.593
Run along.

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:13.598
- But I'll send letters just when I like.
- Yes, yes.

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:21.434
In Africa! I'll become a doctor
and go to Africa!

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:24.068
- That will teach her!
- Yes.

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.313
Is snowing outside! Is snowing!

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.198
- Is true. Is snowing!
- Beautiful!

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.916
Professor Fighetta, up yours!

01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:58.711
If it goes on like this, there will be
no school for a few days.

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.077
The mountains over there are all white!

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:04.276
Les go and see the snow on the sea.

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.715
Is wet. It won't stick.

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.877
Go away! Get the hell out of the way!

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:45.512
Don't move! The sparrows!

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:11.195
- Good night.
- Wait. I'll come with you.

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:12.918
Hurry up.

01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:28.039
Titta! Look how is coming down!

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:32.873
Les open the window.

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.718
Lovely!

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.028
Me too!

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:50.434
Is still snowing! Four days this
goddamn stuff's been around!

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.272
This will go down as "the year
of the big snow."

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:04.034
Since the last ice age...

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.319
...it never snowed so heavily
in our town.

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:09.754
Six feet and...

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.229
That musve been a boy,
not the other person.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:19.551
As I was saying,
the exceptional years were...

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:22.837
...1541,1694...

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.151
...1728, 1888...

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:30.791
...when oddly enough,
it snowed on July 13th.

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:58.477
Got to hell, asshole!

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.437
Where did she?

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:28.474
How's your mother?

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:30.790
Better now.

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.152
She's still in the hospital,
but she's off the critical list.

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:39.440
Thas good. Poor woman.
Give her my regards when you see her.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.158
Your mother's a kind lady.

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:44.676
She always brought me soup...

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:48.310
...and a glass of wine. She's good.

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.713
Good morning.

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.478
Mom!

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:21.998
Hi, Miranda.

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.118
How are you feeling?

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:28.470
- I've brought you some flowers.
- Thank you. How are you?

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:33.269
Hi, Aurelio. They're lovely!

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:37.195
I was just looking out,
now I'll go back to bed.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:41.353
But I'm feeling better today.
What a lovely color!

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.354
- Are you hot with this?
- Thank you.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.193
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.949
- Are you still annoying your father?
- He slaps my head so hard, Mom!

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.033
I'll end up stupid!

01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:24.189
There's a nice little garden here.
I didn't know.

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.750
It looks in bloom with the snow.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.309
Mom, is still snowing.

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:33.879
In a way, you're lucky, Miranda...

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.430
...to be here warm in bed
with this weather.

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:40.870
He's tired, poor man,
when he gets home.

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:42.632
- He works all day.
- Yes, Mom.

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:45.360
You shouldn't answer back.
You're a young man now.

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.469
Don't throw ice! It hurts!

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.070
Take that, Ovo!

01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:58.869
With such wind and such snow,
who's there knocking at my door?

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.756
Idiot! No!

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.956
You stupid!

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:09.914
- Stop it! No!
- A difficult shot, Your Excellency!

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:16.597
- Oh, this time I hit you!
- Gradisca!

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.198
Take this, Gradisca!

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.711
No! Not at Gradisca! No!

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:24.235
You guys are strong!

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:25.719
Leave Gradisca alone!

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.956
Enough! I give up!

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.237
- Gradisca ran away!
- Gradisca, come here!

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:36.279
If you break my windows,
I'll kill you all!

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.959
Who is it?

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.312
- What is it?
- I don't know.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:00.360
Look, is the couns peacock!

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.838
There! There it is!

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:06.679
Is coming down!

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.755
Shall we catch it, boys?

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.634
What a moron!

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:34.797
I don't understand. Whas happened?

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:37.428
I'll tell you in the car, Uncle.

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:40.552
Why in the car?
Where are we going?

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:43.712
Quite near.
To Aunt Zaira's farm.

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.236
A relative's come from America
and wants to say hi to you.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.995
Well, why doesn't he
come here, then?

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:53.230
Who is this relative, anyway?

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.274
Hi.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.477
My aunt is dead.

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.791
Be strong. Be strong.

01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:37.798
Titta, no.

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:40.713
Don't do that. Titta, open up!

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.111
- Open up.
- No, I won't!

01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:13.196
Lallo! He's fainted.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.274
Dad, Uncle's feeling sick.

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.431
Take him to the whorehouse then!

01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:28.349
Make the sign of the cross, Dad.

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:52.029
- How do you feel now?
- Better!

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.879
- Little Miranda!
- Don't take it so hard. Be strong!

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.478
Now, everybody in line.
Where are the orphans?

01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:35.517
Stop that!

01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:07.672
- Hurray for the bride and groom!
- Hurray!

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:11.716
Give me your arm, Naso.

01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:16.670
Make way, make way,
my breasts are full of milk!

01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:20.354
I raise my glass
to the newlyweds...

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:23.671
...on this day full of hay
and say, may you live...

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:26.788
...happily in Battipaglia,
night and day.

01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:30.270
When you're drunk, you can even rhyme!

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:37.190
Gradisca's getting married
and going away!

01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:42.552
We want to say that we're sorry
if we made you angry...

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:44.438
...and we hate to see you go!

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:49.275
We'll miss you badly!

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:52.593
- Hurray for the newlyweds!
- Hurray!

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.788
Words are silver, silence is gold.

01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:59.191
May this married couple's love
never get old!

01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.430
- Where is the bride?
- Over there.

01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:06.549
Our Gradisca is going away because
she's found her Gary Cooper.

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:09.951
Well, Gary Cooper is a cowboy,
and Matteo is an officer...

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:13.908
...but love's always love.
Good luck, Gradisca!

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.910
Long live the bride and groom!

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:20.231
Today you have crowned
your dream of love.

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:25.076
Now you have a joyous duty
to have many children.

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:29.199
For your family, for the church
and for your country!

01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:35.756
Now that we're together under this sky,
les drink one more and say goodbye.

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:40.195
Photograph! Photograph!

01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:42.828
Now we'll take a great photograph!

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.639
- A mirror!
- Everybody get behind the bride!

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:48.394
This is going to be
a damn good photograph!

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:52.235
She's lovely, our Ninola!
Why are you crying? Are you crazy?

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:55.153
- I'm not.
- Get closer together.

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.470
The officer must move back a little.

01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:58.993
Shoo!

01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:00.479
There. In the light.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.072
- Hold it right there!
- Hey, is raining.

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:07.471
Big smile. Good, good. Done!

01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:09.437
Another one.

01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:10.828
Excuse me!

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.150
Don't fall all over her, you drunken lout!

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.470
I want to hug her too!

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:18.837
Is dark over here.
Les move into the sun.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.310
Follow me.
Here, this is a good place.

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:26.871
Get together. The bride in the center
and the groom over there.

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:30.517
I've made up another poem
that goes like this:

01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:34.434
Though the world may be full
of beautiful things

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:37.951
Full of towns that are attractive
Even more than this

01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:41.556
A drop of water will be good for you.
This way you'll get a bath.

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:43.073
Get up!

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.434
Is stopped raining, sit down.

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:48.472
Sit down! Play!

01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:52.549
- A wet bride is a lucky bride!
- Is the same sea, Ninola...

01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:56.315
...that stretches from here
to our Battipaglia, therefore:

01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:59.278
- Long live Italy!
- Long live Italy!

01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.990
Why, thank you!

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:04.872
Thank you.

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:08.316
How will you live

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:11.074
So far away from our town?

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:15.079
Goodbye to you all!
Go home! Bye!

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:19.712
- Biscein bids you goodbye!
- I ate four bowls of soup...

01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:24.237
...two chickens, three pounds
of sausages and one candle.

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:27.670
Naso!

01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:31.712
Naso, I'm going home!

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:36.511
Wait for me. I'll come with you!

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:38.911
Wait for me, you jerk!

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:01.474
My bouquet! Wait!

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:05.674
So long! I love you all!

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:11.235
- Gradisca's going!
- She's leaving!

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:14.312
- So long, Gradisca!
- Goodbye!

01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:21.475
- So long, Gradisca! So long!
- So long!

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.353
Lallo...

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.433
...look!

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.831
That stuff is mine!

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:45.956
The puffballs!

01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:54.991
- Titta!
- Naso!

01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:57.116
Where's Titta?

01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.999
Shall we go fishing in the harbor?

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:05.834
Titta went away a long time ago.

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:28.069
