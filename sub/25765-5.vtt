WEBVTT

00:00.027 --> 00:02.362
Previously on "Better Call Saul"...

00:02.364 --> 00:04.397
I think he did what he did because of me.

00:04.399 --> 00:07.300
Well, Howard, I guess
that's your cross to bear.

00:07.302 --> 00:11.237
I was thinking that maybe you
should talk to someone.

00:11.239 --> 00:13.173
- A shrink?
- Kevin figures we'll file

00:13.175 --> 00:14.774
for federal charter.

00:14.776 --> 00:16.409
Just observing.

00:16.411 --> 00:18.711
You brought me because you have an ask.

00:18.713 --> 00:20.213
Tell me about the job.

00:20.215 --> 00:22.048
You're looking at Albuquerque's newest

00:22.050 --> 00:24.150
mobile communications specialist.

00:24.152 --> 00:26.452
Cellphone sales.
Strictly gainful employment.

00:26.454 --> 00:28.821
And 10 months from now,
I'm a lawyer again.

00:46.908 --> 00:49.542
Unh! Damn it.

00:52.247 --> 00:54.047
Come on.

00:57.152 --> 00:59.519
Unh! This is the one!

01:03.758 --> 01:05.658
Jackpot!

01:10.388 --> 01:11.587
It's all here.

01:11.623 --> 01:13.422
Meaning what, exactly?

01:13.458 --> 01:15.358
Meaning, uh, you know, field mice,

01:15.393 --> 01:17.793
and, you know, you got
your nest-building squirrel.

01:17.829 --> 01:20.262
You got your... Whatever.

01:20.298 --> 01:22.798
Three cheers for morality.

01:24.302 --> 01:26.736
Hey, where's the, uh... What?

01:26.771 --> 01:28.404
You know, the...

01:28.439 --> 01:29.639
Use your words.

01:29.674 --> 01:31.207
Aha.

01:40.118 --> 01:42.418
Did you shred the files under your desk?

01:42.453 --> 01:44.053
Yes.

01:44.088 --> 01:47.390
Okay.

01:48.793 --> 01:50.159
What about your Rolodex?

01:50.194 --> 01:51.549
Yes, and everything
in the filing cabinets

01:51.584 --> 01:53.396
- and the safe and...
- The stuff in the bathroom.

01:53.431 --> 01:55.464
You did that yourself, remember?

01:55.500 --> 01:56.932
Right, right.

02:33.071 --> 02:34.303
All right, that's it.

02:34.338 --> 02:35.705
I'm going. Do me a favor.

02:35.740 --> 02:36.889
Take those with you.

02:36.925 --> 02:39.308
Drop them off at least five miles
from here... in separate Dumpsters.

02:44.649 --> 02:46.882
Oh, right. Um...

02:55.026 --> 02:56.535
Fine.

03:01.099 --> 03:03.132
Okay, when the cops come talk to you...

03:03.167 --> 03:05.468
and they will...
what are you gonna tell them?

03:05.503 --> 03:06.836
"Talk to my attorney."

03:06.871 --> 03:08.170
Yeah.

03:08.206 --> 03:12.141
Tell 'em, uh, Jimmy sent ya. Okay?

03:12.176 --> 03:13.642
And where are you gonna be
November 12th at 3:00 p.m.?

03:13.678 --> 03:15.144
I'll be there,

03:15.179 --> 03:17.046
but if it doesn't ring
at 3:00 on the dot, I'm gone.

03:17.081 --> 03:19.315
Don't worry. It's gonna ring.

03:19.350 --> 03:23.252
Well, I guess, uh...

03:23.287 --> 03:25.354
that's it.

03:27.525 --> 03:29.158
Quite a ride, huh?

03:34.766 --> 03:37.133
Yep.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.302
I need a new dust filter

04:13.337 --> 04:17.305
for my Hoover Max Extract
Pressure Pro, model 60.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.909
Can you help me with that?

04:20.344 --> 04:21.911
Pickup.

04:21.946 --> 04:24.313
How hot? Red hot.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.315
I know where that is.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.117
I'll be there.

04:40.798 --> 04:48.803
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:04.076 --> 06:05.408
Yep.

06:05.444 --> 06:06.643
Maximum privacy.

06:06.678 --> 06:08.643
It's the best money can buy.

06:09.848 --> 06:12.449
10? No. Can't do it.

06:12.484 --> 06:14.884
Everyone wants these things.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.288
6? Um, yeah. Yeah, I can do 6.

06:18.323 --> 06:20.557
Okay. See you later.

06:23.428 --> 06:25.095
Welcome to CC Mobile.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.464
Sorry to keep you waiting.

06:27.499 --> 06:29.032
What can I do for you?

06:30.335 --> 06:32.902
So, privacy sold here?

06:32.938 --> 06:35.638
Yep. This is the place.

06:35.674 --> 06:37.540
Privacy from who?

06:37.576 --> 06:39.809
Come on. You know.

06:39.845 --> 06:42.312
Like, the government?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.614
Could be.

06:45.263 --> 06:47.517
Like the IRS?

06:48.350 --> 06:49.986
Bingo!

06:55.352 --> 06:56.526
So...

06:56.561 --> 07:00.497
So, uh, say you got
a cash-based business.

07:00.532 --> 07:02.165
Like a contracting business?

07:02.531 --> 07:04.701
Contracting. Could be. Could be.

07:04.736 --> 07:07.504
Maybe you don't report
every single penny.

07:07.539 --> 07:08.938
I mean, who does, right?

07:08.974 --> 07:10.707
How are you doing that business?

07:10.742 --> 07:11.941
On the phone.

07:11.977 --> 07:14.043
How are you scheduling appointments?

07:14.079 --> 07:15.445
On the phone.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.113
How are you arranging payments?
On the phone.

07:17.149 --> 07:19.716
And who's listening? That's right.

07:19.751 --> 07:22.118
They know every lick and tittle.

07:22.154 --> 07:23.720
So, you're living your life
free and easy,

07:23.755 --> 07:26.723
and then one day,
at a time of their choosing...

07:26.758 --> 07:29.959
bam! they bring the hammer
down to Chinatown.

07:29.995 --> 07:32.962
- Jesus.
- Jesus is right.

07:32.998 --> 07:35.331
I'm telling you,
these guys don't fool around.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.000
And they will clean your bones

07:37.035 --> 07:38.802
faster than a school of piranhas.

07:38.837 --> 07:40.737
I'll tell you what I do.

07:40.772 --> 07:44.741
I practice something we call
information hygiene.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.714
Can't be traced.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.149
Can't be tracked.

07:53.185 --> 07:55.552
That'll keep you clean as a whistle.

07:55.587 --> 07:58.555
What they don't know can't hurt you,

07:58.590 --> 08:01.758
especially if you use it only once per.

08:01.793 --> 08:04.060
You know, that's kind of key.

08:04.095 --> 08:05.762
"Once per"?

08:06.303 --> 08:07.764
Once per what?

08:07.799 --> 08:12.168
Once per week,
once per day, once per call.

08:12.204 --> 08:15.562
I mean, depends on
the nature of your situation.

08:16.107 --> 08:19.209
How much are they?

08:19.244 --> 08:23.246
They're cheaper than an audit,
guaranteed.

08:24.282 --> 08:26.783
Unfortunately...

08:26.818 --> 08:28.384
What?

08:28.420 --> 08:30.386
Well, this one's spoken for.

08:30.422 --> 08:33.789
My supply is very short.

08:33.825 --> 08:37.659
Well, people are gobbling
these up like Tic Tacs.

08:46.838 --> 08:48.805
Thanks again.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.807
Tell your friends.

10:08.153 --> 10:09.886
Hello?

10:09.921 --> 10:11.487
Welcome to the USA.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.489
Use the prepaid parking ticket

10:13.525 --> 10:15.158
in the cup holder to exit the lot.

10:15.193 --> 10:16.492
Make a right.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.828
Follow the signs for I-70 west.

10:18.863 --> 10:21.130
- Got it?
- 70 headed west. Yes.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.498
Keep the phone close by,

10:22.534 --> 10:24.200
and I'll call you in about 20 minutes

10:24.235 --> 10:26.302
and talk you through
the rest of it, okay?

10:26.338 --> 10:28.705
I understand. Yes.

11:08.413 --> 11:10.747
Yes.

11:10.782 --> 11:16.252
I'm here, mark 238,
but there's nobody here.

11:16.287 --> 11:18.554
You need to relieve yourself?

11:18.590 --> 11:19.954
No.

11:21.226 --> 11:23.059
- Where are you?
- You sure?

11:23.094 --> 11:25.962
Because if you do,
I suggest you do it now.

11:25.997 --> 11:29.032
You're not going to have
another chance for awhile.

11:29.067 --> 11:30.566
As I said, I'm fine.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.368
Suit yourself.

11:32.404 --> 11:35.571
Pop the trunk. Inside, you'll see a hood.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.540
Take it out. Close the trunk.

11:37.575 --> 11:39.575
Place your luggage next to you,

11:39.611 --> 11:41.577
and put the hood on.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.046
That clear?

11:43.081 --> 11:45.782
You want me to stand here
with a hood on my head?

11:45.817 --> 11:47.216
Those are the rules.

12:58.890 --> 13:01.124
Step forward.

13:16.508 --> 13:18.541
We're gonna hit some rough road.

13:18.576 --> 13:20.877
There's a strap for you to hold on to

13:20.912 --> 13:23.379
if you reach out to your left.

13:26.518 --> 13:29.152
You want some water?

13:29.187 --> 13:30.710
No, thanks.

14:00.885 --> 14:04.187
Step down. Then walk.

14:10.261 --> 14:11.794
There are stairs.

14:11.830 --> 14:13.462
Step up.

14:13.498 --> 14:15.198
Forward.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.373
That's good.

14:24.409 --> 14:26.057
Right there.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.937
Whew!

14:37.485 --> 14:39.555
So, where, exactly?

14:40.446 --> 14:42.558
The entrance will be back there.

14:42.594 --> 14:44.827
You need to stay within
the footprint of the building.

15:37.749 --> 15:39.714
All right.

15:42.887 --> 15:44.220
You can do it?

15:44.255 --> 15:46.222
Absolutely.

15:46.257 --> 15:47.857
How long will it take?

15:48.347 --> 15:49.792
I want to say seven months,

15:49.827 --> 15:52.028
but I think I could do it in six.

15:52.063 --> 15:53.829
Even with blasting?

15:53.865 --> 15:56.966
The geologist's report was very thorough,

15:57.001 --> 15:59.635
and with the right equipment,
modern methods,

15:59.671 --> 16:02.471
blasting will be quite unnecessary...

16:02.507 --> 16:06.475
assuming your employer
is willing to meet my price.

16:06.949 --> 16:08.711
Price isn't an issue.

16:09.243 --> 16:10.479
Copy That.

16:10.515 --> 16:13.849
So, 56 feet down with no blasting,

16:13.885 --> 16:17.653
working nights only,
you're saying seven months, max?

16:17.689 --> 16:22.058
My men and I dug a tunnel under
the border into downtown El Paso

16:22.093 --> 16:25.828
3/4 of a kilometer long, undetected.

16:25.863 --> 16:28.331
That took us 17 weeks.

16:28.366 --> 16:32.535
If I can do that,
I can certainly do this.

16:43.114 --> 16:44.445
Yeah?

16:45.216 --> 16:46.781
Mm-hmm.

16:47.652 --> 16:49.158
Yep.

16:49.554 --> 16:51.369
That's what I thought.

16:55.957 --> 16:58.094
Thank you for your time.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.430
Pardon?

17:49.468 --> 17:51.312
Pull the short end.

17:52.415 --> 17:54.415
It's too tight. Live with it.

17:54.451 --> 17:56.160
Where do you look when
the judge is talking to you?

17:56.195 --> 17:57.420
In the eyes.

17:57.455 --> 17:58.789
And what do you call the judge?

17:58.858 --> 18:00.521
- "Sir"?
- "Ma'am."

18:00.557 --> 18:02.757
Or, better still, "Your Honor."

18:04.107 --> 18:06.842
Sit over there. And leave that alone.

18:12.182 --> 18:14.716
Not guilty? You can't be serious.

18:14.751 --> 18:16.685
On what planet
would you take this to trial?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.353
You should work with me on this one.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.722
The kid threw a cinder block
through a jewelry-store window,

18:20.757 --> 18:22.157
and I have a witness.

18:22.192 --> 18:24.106
Frankly, I'm being generous.

18:24.141 --> 18:26.261
I want six months probation,

18:26.296 --> 18:27.896
time served, no jail.

18:27.931 --> 18:30.765
And I want to win the lottery
and breed labradoodles.

18:30.801 --> 18:32.067
Nice try, Bill.

18:32.102 --> 18:33.935
You're not gonna get away with it.

18:33.971 --> 18:35.203
Away with what?

18:35.239 --> 18:36.538
Come on.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.540
You're not gonna play dumb, are you?

18:38.575 --> 18:40.542
Please enlighten me.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.944
The arresting officers took the
first part of my guy's statement

18:42.980 --> 18:44.746
before he was Mirandized.

18:44.781 --> 18:47.349
They collected evidence
based on that interview,

18:47.384 --> 18:48.783
and you knew all about it.

18:48.819 --> 18:51.353
That's irrelevant.

18:51.388 --> 18:53.741
How would you... Why would you even...

18:54.791 --> 18:56.591
Your guy did it.

18:56.627 --> 18:59.294
Bill, you don't want me
to bring this up with the judge.

18:59.329 --> 19:01.029
Not only will your case be DOA,

19:01.064 --> 19:04.009
but she will rip you a new one
on the record.

19:05.425 --> 19:08.203
- The judge is not buying any of that.
- I think she will.

19:08.238 --> 19:09.632
It's all right here.

19:11.926 --> 19:13.708
Listen, I...

19:15.412 --> 19:18.146
Okay. 10 months jail.

19:18.181 --> 19:20.782
6 months probation, time served.

19:21.435 --> 19:24.219
This kid needs a chance
to turn his life around,

19:24.254 --> 19:26.288
not rot in prison and join a gang.

19:26.323 --> 19:27.622
Are you joking?

19:27.658 --> 19:30.225
We started at 18 months jail.

19:30.260 --> 19:31.793
Up to you.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.504
Eight months jail.

19:42.873 --> 19:44.806
Four months probation.

19:44.841 --> 19:47.676
- Wait. What happened to six?
- You're annoying me.

19:47.711 --> 19:49.611
You can't play chicken with me.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.613
I invented chicken.

19:53.050 --> 19:56.117
Wow. Okay.

20:02.459 --> 20:03.792
Fine.

20:05.462 --> 20:08.566
Six months jail time, one year probation.

20:10.985 --> 20:13.034
I can't make four months fly.

20:13.070 --> 20:16.504
It's impossible, completely impossible.

20:17.708 --> 20:19.474
You don't have time for this.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.643
Bill, I only have one other client,

20:21.678 --> 20:23.044
and it's a bank.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.959
I have all the time in the world.

20:24.995 --> 20:26.114
All rise

20:26.139 --> 20:27.282
for the Honorable Judge Lipitz.

20:29.886 --> 20:31.453
The judge.

20:31.488 --> 20:32.715
Yeah.

20:36.093 --> 20:37.659
CR2003114721...

20:37.694 --> 20:39.794
- Fine.
- Four months.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.863
Four months probation?

20:41.898 --> 20:43.865
...State versus David Estrada.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.668
- Yes.
- Good morning.

20:46.737 --> 20:48.189
Please be seated.

20:50.607 --> 20:52.374
If I may, Your Honor.

20:52.409 --> 20:53.875
Yes, Ms. Wexler.

20:53.910 --> 20:56.478
I'm happy to say
the defense and prosecution

20:56.513 --> 20:57.990
have reached an agreement.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.083
Hey, wait. No. Stand still.

21:02.119 --> 21:04.319
This is mine, remember?

21:06.456 --> 21:08.490
Um, I don't mean to rush you,

21:08.525 --> 21:11.092
but the meeting's in 15,
and with traffic...

21:11.128 --> 21:13.495
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

21:15.532 --> 21:17.999
I'm gonna have
a probation officer on my ass

21:18.035 --> 21:19.567
for fourth months?

21:20.537 --> 21:22.504
David, listen to me.

21:22.539 --> 21:24.105
Here's what you're gonna do.

21:24.141 --> 21:25.707
Today, after you leave here,

21:25.742 --> 21:27.776
you will go straight to
your grandfather's restaurant,

21:27.811 --> 21:30.512
and you will beg him for a job, any job.

21:30.547 --> 21:32.447
If he tells you to scrub
the grill, you scrub the grill.

21:32.482 --> 21:34.349
If he tells you to clean the toilet,

21:34.384 --> 21:35.717
you clean the toilet.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.513
You will show up on time.

21:37.548 --> 21:38.606
You will smile.

21:38.642 --> 21:41.056
You will say "please" and "thank you."

21:41.091 --> 21:42.694
You will keep your nose clean.

21:42.729 --> 21:44.078
You understand?

21:46.963 --> 21:50.918
Because if you don't,
you will go to jail.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.644
Grown-up jail with grown-up bad guys.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.214
Picture that, David.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.415
Really picture it.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.753
And know this...

22:02.788 --> 22:04.988
I'm not gonna do
a damn thing about it next time.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.601
You got it?

22:08.260 --> 22:09.937
Mm-hmm.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.229
Okay.

22:19.238 --> 22:22.372
Nope. No.

22:22.408 --> 22:25.576
Uh... no. Nope.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.377
Wait. Wait. Hey, look.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.980
"Doctor Zhivago" is about to start.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.649
Lots of attractive men in the snow.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.786
That's your favorite genre.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.988
Mm. I'm sorry.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.389
I can't.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.657
I have tons of Mesa Verde to catch up on.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.593
Isn't that why you have a paralegal?

22:42.628 --> 22:44.394
Well, I have to review her work.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.597
You watch.

22:46.632 --> 22:48.599
Thanks.

22:50.636 --> 22:53.270
Can you work with the TV on?

22:53.305 --> 22:56.974
I have tremendous powers
of concentration.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.811
Go ahead. It's fine.

23:50.412 --> 23:51.662
It wasn't bothering me.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.575
Yeah, I know.

23:54.611 --> 23:55.666
I just, uh,

23:55.701 --> 23:59.302
realized there's something
I need to to do at work.

23:59.338 --> 24:01.872
At 9:00 at night?

24:01.907 --> 24:03.573
Yeah, well, it's my first week, you know?

24:03.609 --> 24:05.008
I want to make a good impression.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.877
I'm just getting the hang
of the system, so...

24:06.912 --> 24:09.079
Okay. I'll just go in the bedroom.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.081
Absolutely not. You have work.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.717
I have work. It's okay.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.018
Okay.

24:15.054 --> 24:17.287
It's all good. Don't wait up.

25:29.557 --> 25:32.124
Hey! How's it going?

25:32.159 --> 25:34.364
How you guys set for phones?

25:34.365 --> 25:36.024
We got phones.

25:36.059 --> 25:38.034
Private phones.

25:38.069 --> 25:39.602
Beat it, narc.

25:39.637 --> 25:41.003
Oh, come on.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.571
Would a narc drive this piece of shit?

25:44.142 --> 25:46.075
Take it back to impound, narc.

25:48.546 --> 25:50.046
Loser.

28:17.356 --> 28:19.323
Later.

28:27.299 --> 28:28.932
Wait up, man.

29:12.711 --> 29:15.078
This one?

29:15.114 --> 29:17.414
Yeah, no fat boy's
supposed to ride like that.

29:19.251 --> 29:20.684
Hi. How are you?

29:22.121 --> 29:24.454
That's a beautiful ride.

29:26.091 --> 29:28.208
Hey. How's it going?

29:37.770 --> 29:39.736
Did you get, uh...

29:39.772 --> 29:42.406
Did you get that ink in Los Lunas?

29:43.709 --> 29:45.075
Las Cruces.

29:46.378 --> 29:48.145
Off by one.

29:48.947 --> 29:50.522
And you've been inside?

29:51.483 --> 29:53.116
No, I haven't had the honor,

29:53.152 --> 29:55.043
but I used to be a lawyer.

29:55.078 --> 29:57.255
Emphasis on "used to be."

29:57.255 --> 29:59.422
And I helped a lot of gentlemen
such as yourself...

29:59.457 --> 30:00.990
and your friends here.

30:01.025 --> 30:03.426
And one thing I learned
from working with my clients

30:03.461 --> 30:05.228
in the New Mexico corrections system

30:05.263 --> 30:08.564
is that private conversations
are few and far between.

30:08.600 --> 30:12.635
The man is always
listening on those land lines.

30:12.670 --> 30:15.238
So word to the wise...

30:15.273 --> 30:18.641
uh, if you want to talk
to your friends on the inside,

30:18.676 --> 30:20.843
there is a simple solution.

30:20.879 --> 30:24.046
Yeah? What's that?

30:28.620 --> 30:30.019
This little baby.

30:30.054 --> 30:32.455
It's the most compact model
on the market.

30:32.490 --> 30:36.492
It could be hidden
in any number of places.

30:36.528 --> 30:38.661
And if you buy it from me with cash,

30:38.696 --> 30:41.731
it's completely untraceable.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.203
How much?

30:50.308 --> 30:53.342
Keep the rubber side down!

31:14.732 --> 31:16.499
Sorry, guys. You had your chance.

31:16.534 --> 31:18.167
I'm all sold out.

31:18.203 --> 31:19.969
Give me your money.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.504
I'm a narc, remember?

31:21.539 --> 31:23.473
No. We saw you got cash.

31:23.508 --> 31:25.341
- Hand it over.
- Nice try.

31:25.376 --> 31:27.009
Look, Pee Wee, Scooter, Skippy,

31:27.045 --> 31:28.845
it was very good to meet you boys.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.147
Good look with
the junior achievement project.

31:31.182 --> 31:32.682
I-I got to go.

31:32.717 --> 31:34.350
Hey. Hey!

31:36.187 --> 31:38.387
Hey!

31:39.958 --> 31:41.324
Ohh!

31:41.359 --> 31:44.660
Aah! Ohh! Aah!

31:44.696 --> 31:46.662
Aah! Get it.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.164
Go. Go. Go.

31:48.199 --> 31:50.166
Come on, man.

31:50.201 --> 31:51.934
Ugh!

32:37.909 --> 32:39.308
I'm sorry.

32:39.344 --> 32:41.577
I didn't mean to wake you.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.547
It's okay.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.658
What happened?

32:49.654 --> 32:51.536
I got mugged.

33:03.475 --> 33:05.675
Jesus, that's cold.

33:05.711 --> 33:08.478
So? Keep it on there.

33:08.514 --> 33:10.147
Are you sure
you don't want to go to the E.R.

33:10.182 --> 33:12.849
- just to be safe?
- No, I'm fine, really.

33:13.619 --> 33:15.085
What are you doing?

33:15.120 --> 33:17.354
I'm checking that your pupils
are the same size.

33:18.605 --> 33:21.358
I'm okay. I swear.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.164
Sorry.

33:44.133 --> 33:45.474
Whew.

33:47.553 --> 33:48.785
Look at us.

33:48.821 --> 33:51.188
We're like a Mathew Brady photo.

33:52.758 --> 33:55.525
Yeah. I think you'd need
a cannon to really sell that.

33:58.764 --> 34:01.331
So, this happened at The Dog House?

34:01.366 --> 34:02.607
Yeah.

34:03.268 --> 34:05.535
At 1:30 in the morning?

34:05.571 --> 34:07.771
Um... I lost track of time.

34:07.806 --> 34:09.039
Mm.

34:09.074 --> 34:12.641
And, uh, parked too far away, so...

34:12.678 --> 34:15.745
It was just dumb.

34:15.781 --> 34:17.848
Did you call the police?

34:17.882 --> 34:19.748
Nah. What's the point?

34:19.784 --> 34:21.351
Anyway, I don't feel like

34:21.386 --> 34:23.553
spending the rest of the night downtown

34:23.589 --> 34:26.840
looking at mug shots
of kids with stringy hair.

34:27.693 --> 34:30.427
What the hell's the matter with me?

34:35.801 --> 34:37.667
It sounds like you were just

34:37.703 --> 34:40.070
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

34:43.809 --> 34:47.010
Back in the day, I would have spotted

34:47.045 --> 34:49.379
those low-rent little skeeves
from a mile away,

34:49.414 --> 34:52.014
and they would have known not to roll me.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.074
Yeah? How would they have known that?

34:54.620 --> 34:57.787
I don't. Just...

34:57.823 --> 35:01.166
Well, because back then, uh...

35:01.827 --> 35:04.002
I guess I was one of them.

35:05.831 --> 35:09.032
Well, those days are over.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.175
Yeah.

35:10.936 --> 35:12.636
But, uh...

35:15.818 --> 35:17.140
What?

35:21.186 --> 35:22.612
You know what?

35:22.648 --> 35:25.415
Um, I think tomorrow

35:25.450 --> 35:29.903
I might, uh, call that shrink.

35:31.857 --> 35:33.531
Couldn't hurt, right?

35:34.860 --> 35:36.701
No. Couldn't hurt.

36:22.908 --> 36:24.808
Denise!

36:24.843 --> 36:26.918
It's Kim Wexler!

36:30.916 --> 36:33.483
Denise, why are you still here?

36:33.518 --> 36:36.820
You were supposed to meet me
in court an hour ago.

36:36.855 --> 36:38.787
So, I missed it, right?

36:38.822 --> 36:40.008
Not yet.

36:40.043 --> 36:41.199
I got the clerk to push your hearing,

36:41.235 --> 36:43.126
but we've got to go now.

36:44.696 --> 36:46.496
I can't.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.132
I'm freaking out.

36:49.167 --> 36:54.971
I'm sorry, Ms. Wexler,
but I can't go to jail.

37:04.549 --> 37:07.042
I can't promise you no jail time.

37:09.554 --> 37:11.054
But what I do know for sure

37:11.089 --> 37:13.923
is that if you don't
come with me right now to court,

37:13.959 --> 37:16.326
the judge is gonna issue a bench warrant,

37:16.361 --> 37:19.162
and then jail is a done deal.

37:25.037 --> 37:27.020
Denise, you can do this.

37:28.938 --> 37:30.899
It's your first offense.

37:31.636 --> 37:33.401
It was under two ounces.

37:37.582 --> 37:40.033
Trust me. I'm good at this.

37:49.876 --> 37:52.462
Why don't you change into something nice.

37:53.432 --> 37:55.048
We'll do this together.

38:11.016 --> 38:12.882
Hi, Paige.

38:12.918 --> 38:15.118
Kim, we've got a huge problem.

38:15.153 --> 38:17.721
There's a major error
in the branch paperwork

38:17.756 --> 38:19.989
that went out to Denver and Flagstaff.

38:20.025 --> 38:21.491
It has to be fixed ASAP.

38:21.526 --> 38:24.060
Unfortunately, I'm right
in the middle of something,

38:24.096 --> 38:25.595
but I can be there at 4:00.

38:25.630 --> 38:27.997
- I need you now.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I can't.

38:28.033 --> 38:29.399
I don't know what to tell you, Paige.

38:29.434 --> 38:30.934
I just... Not right now.

38:30.969 --> 38:32.802
- But, Kim, this is...
- I'm sorry.

38:39.884 --> 38:42.078
Denise, it's time!

38:43.281 --> 38:46.015
Come on! We got to go!

38:50.055 --> 38:51.400
You look great.

38:51.436 --> 38:52.814
Thanks.

38:59.464 --> 39:02.232
All right. Let's go get 'em.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.513
Paige, I'm so sorry.

39:16.548 --> 39:18.815
- Let's get this fixed right now.
- It's fixed.

39:18.850 --> 39:20.216
I had to pull everyone on the floor

39:20.252 --> 39:21.651
to re-type and proof the submission

39:21.686 --> 39:23.353
because we didn't have the files

39:23.388 --> 39:25.471
and your paralegal
didn't know where they were.

39:26.723 --> 39:28.691
I'd really like to apologize
to Kevin personally, as well,

39:28.727 --> 39:29.959
if he's available.

39:29.995 --> 39:31.294
He's not.

39:31.769 --> 39:33.463
Let me be very clear.

39:33.498 --> 39:35.865
The mistake is not the issue here.

39:35.901 --> 39:37.567
Everyone makes mistakes.

39:37.602 --> 39:41.279
But I need to know your head is in this.

39:42.107 --> 39:43.440
You made us a promise

39:43.475 --> 39:45.408
that Mesa Verde would be your sole focus.

39:45.444 --> 39:48.077
When we need you, we need you.

39:48.747 --> 39:50.872
We're not a client you hang up on.

39:53.718 --> 39:55.460
I'm really sorry, Paige.

39:57.155 --> 39:59.005
It'll never happen again.

40:00.340 --> 40:02.091
I hope not.

40:27.311 --> 40:29.247
Speak English, please.

40:29.283 --> 40:32.073
I'm going to throw up.

40:32.073 --> 40:34.306
I suggest you don't.

40:34.342 --> 40:37.009
Now, hold on. We're almost there.

40:44.819 --> 40:47.119
Thank you.

40:57.665 --> 40:59.965
Ahh.

41:05.006 --> 41:07.039
You okay?

41:08.609 --> 41:10.142
Better.

41:12.180 --> 41:13.679
Pardon.

41:16.584 --> 41:20.986
I take the Dramamine,
but it doesn't help.

41:28.796 --> 41:30.221
Okay.

41:50.325 --> 41:51.851
Over there?

41:54.422 --> 41:55.997
Over there.

43:25.753 --> 43:27.279
So?

43:27.797 --> 43:29.423
Hmm?

43:35.248 --> 43:38.149
Before I can begin excavation,

43:38.174 --> 43:41.542
I must support the existing structure

43:41.567 --> 43:43.396
to avoid a cave-in.

43:45.566 --> 43:49.100
Normally, this would involve
the piling rig,

43:49.125 --> 43:50.820
working from above.

43:53.239 --> 43:57.209
But there can be no activity
visible from the surface, hmm?

44:00.448 --> 44:05.484
So I must construct secant walls
of CFA piles,

44:05.519 --> 44:08.337
working completely underground.

44:11.225 --> 44:13.025
Um, difficult.

44:13.060 --> 44:17.730
Next, I must somehow place I-beams

44:17.765 --> 44:20.733
across the top of the secant walls

44:20.768 --> 44:25.271
to support the floor and the machinery.

44:28.376 --> 44:30.175
Excuse me.

44:40.588 --> 44:42.955
Only now can I fully excavate.

44:43.724 --> 44:48.761
I will need to move perhaps
1,700 cubic meters of dirt.

44:48.796 --> 44:53.098
That means trucking out about 200 loads.

44:58.817 --> 45:02.652
Going this deep, we will surely hit rock,

45:02.677 --> 45:04.643
which means blasting.

45:12.620 --> 45:16.455
I will need schematics
of utility in the area.

45:16.490 --> 45:17.990
You'll get those.

45:18.025 --> 45:21.393
Once the space is fully cleared,
I can waterproof,

45:21.429 --> 45:23.796
then fabricate casts
for the retaining walls

45:23.831 --> 45:25.650
and pour concrete.

45:25.685 --> 45:29.301
We would need, uh...

45:32.440 --> 45:36.976
About 150 cubic meters.

45:37.011 --> 45:39.762
This is just the beginning.

45:40.848 --> 45:44.216
And all this in complete secrecy.

45:46.988 --> 45:48.620
Judging from the sounds I heard,

45:48.656 --> 45:50.856
I assume we are not far from a town.

45:50.891 --> 45:55.728
This is also not... optimal.

45:57.822 --> 46:02.865
A project like this,
many, many things can go wrong.

46:16.684 --> 46:19.885
So, it's impossible?

46:21.422 --> 46:27.726
Dangerous, difficult,
and very, very expensive...

46:28.728 --> 46:31.030
not quite impossible.

46:32.333 --> 46:34.400
Gustavo Fring.

46:34.435 --> 46:36.402
_

46:49.665 --> 46:51.316
You're good.

46:52.620 --> 46:53.886
See you, Marty.

46:53.921 --> 46:55.220
See you, Jimmy.

46:55.256 --> 46:57.489
- Ready for me?
- Okay, next.

47:03.964 --> 47:05.831
Howard.

47:09.403 --> 47:12.004
Everything okay?

47:12.480 --> 47:14.173
Everything's fine.

47:14.607 --> 47:16.341
And how are you doing?

47:16.377 --> 47:17.910
I've been better.

47:17.945 --> 47:21.113
I'm heading up to the D.A.'s
office for my PPD check-in,

47:21.148 --> 47:22.848
so, you know...

47:23.324 --> 47:24.917
Yeah.

47:24.952 --> 47:26.369
Anyway...

47:34.395 --> 47:36.587
You sure you're okay?

47:38.165 --> 47:41.533
I'm supposed to be in court in, uh...

47:41.569 --> 47:42.935
about 25 minutes.

47:42.970 --> 47:44.369
Big case?

47:44.405 --> 47:45.888
Not particularly.

47:46.974 --> 47:48.435
So, what's up?

47:48.470 --> 47:50.609
Nothing.

47:50.644 --> 47:51.944
Just...

47:55.316 --> 47:57.149
You ever have insomnia?

47:57.985 --> 47:59.360
Not really.

48:00.588 --> 48:02.446
Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

48:04.658 --> 48:06.558
Oof.

48:07.410 --> 48:08.961
Don't they have pills for that?

48:12.099 --> 48:13.966
I'm... I'm sorry.

48:14.001 --> 48:15.968
I got to ask.

48:16.003 --> 48:19.130
Um, what's... what's eating you?

48:20.808 --> 48:22.091
Jimmy...

48:27.815 --> 48:30.349
I think I've shared enough...

48:30.384 --> 48:32.143
more than enough.

48:34.221 --> 48:36.622
Let's leave it at that.

48:39.560 --> 48:41.059
I get it.

48:43.230 --> 48:44.796
You know what, Howard?

48:44.832 --> 48:48.761
Uh, you do yourself a favor,
and you go see someone.

48:48.762 --> 48:51.329
I actually have the number of a shrink.

48:51.365 --> 48:52.664
I got it for a client.

48:52.699 --> 48:54.733
And he's supposed to be great.

48:54.768 --> 48:59.170
I think, um,
I got it right here, actually.

48:59.206 --> 49:00.538
Uh, thanks.

49:00.574 --> 49:02.173
I'm already seeing someone.

49:03.277 --> 49:04.542
Really?

49:04.578 --> 49:06.093
Twice a week.

49:07.636 --> 49:09.638
Is he any good?

49:10.450 --> 49:11.891
Yes.

49:15.822 --> 49:17.722
Good seeing you, Howard.

49:17.758 --> 49:19.440
You too.

50:01.268 --> 50:03.601
Can you hold, please?

50:03.637 --> 50:04.944
Thank you.

50:09.209 --> 50:11.242
Uh, yes, sir,
this is, uh, Steve Carlton...

50:11.278 --> 50:14.612
So, where were we?

50:14.648 --> 50:16.314
Community service.

50:16.350 --> 50:19.291
Community service. Right.

50:20.584 --> 50:22.420
Well, it looks like
you completed your hours.

50:22.456 --> 50:23.822
Yep.

50:23.857 --> 50:26.424
Your PPD fees are up to date.

50:26.460 --> 50:29.961
And you've recently procured
lawful employment at...

50:29.997 --> 50:31.663
CC Mobile.

50:31.698 --> 50:33.164
Address?

50:33.200 --> 50:36.634
8351 Louisiana Boulevard.

50:36.670 --> 50:39.037
8351 Louisiana.

50:40.374 --> 50:41.940
How many hours a week?

50:43.354 --> 50:47.012
This week, uh, 31, but I'll pick up more.

50:47.047 --> 50:48.680
Next month, bring pay stubs.

50:48.715 --> 50:50.114
Will do.

50:51.084 --> 50:54.201
Are you associating
with any known criminals?

50:54.688 --> 50:56.161
No.

50:57.204 --> 50:58.656
All right.

50:59.081 --> 51:01.126
Month two looks good.

51:02.042 --> 51:03.461
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do

51:03.497 --> 51:05.129
once your PPD is up?

51:06.255 --> 51:08.382
I have some plans.

51:09.503 --> 51:11.051
Okay.

51:11.705 --> 51:13.262
Such as...

51:15.347 --> 51:19.210
Until then, I'll show up here
every second Monday of the month

51:19.246 --> 51:20.745
like clockwork.

51:20.781 --> 51:22.981
I'm gonna keep my job
at the cellphone store,

51:23.016 --> 51:26.084
and in 9 months and 24 days,

51:26.119 --> 51:28.486
I will get my law license back.

51:28.522 --> 51:31.322
My partner and I will get a new office.

51:31.358 --> 51:36.528
It'll be like it was,
but bigger and better.

51:37.328 --> 51:39.330
Everything will be better.

51:39.366 --> 51:41.066
I'm gonna have more clients.

51:41.101 --> 51:42.700
I'm gonna win more cases.

51:42.736 --> 51:44.502
I'm gonna be a damn good lawyer,

51:44.538 --> 51:46.871
- and people are gonna know about it.
- Okay.

51:47.880 --> 51:51.216
So... lawyer.

51:52.885 --> 51:54.913
Yeah.

51:55.346 --> 51:56.930
Lawyer.
