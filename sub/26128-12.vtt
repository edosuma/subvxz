WEBVTT

00:01.252 --> 00:03.004
For those of you
who were too fuckin' busy,

00:03.087 --> 00:04.839
here's what happened
last week on <i>Shameless.</i>

00:06.090 --> 00:08.009
Fuck it.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.053
Aye, aye, matey.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.555
Popcorn shrimp.
Fuck.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.181
You ever worked
on the line, Carl?

00:14.265 --> 00:15.975
- In the kitchen?
- Grab an apron.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.185
Girls' day.

00:18.269 --> 00:19.520
It's a date.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.815
Yo, that's my sister
and my girlfriend.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.316
Which one's your sister?

00:24.400 --> 00:25.901
Uh, she's macking
on your girl, huh?

00:25.985 --> 00:27.194
I'ma head upstairs
right now.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.779
I'd really like
if you came with me.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.906
No way.
She needs to see how it ends.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.743
I know how it ends.

00:33.826 --> 00:34.994
...unless there's something

00:35.077 --> 00:36.078
you're not telling me.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.413
Agh! Fine!
I didn't get a vasectomy.

00:37.496 --> 00:38.539
I pretended to.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.708
I'll reschedule the vasectomy
right now.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.293
<i>Your father
is gonna be the new</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:45.254
Hobo Loco beverage
spokesperson.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.299
Soon I'll be able
to support those I love.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.508
Little Frank-ettes.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.635
Frank'll be committed
to my six babies, right?

00:51.719 --> 00:52.595
Not a chance.

00:52.678 --> 00:53.763
Frank, something's wrong.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.222
- I'm in pain.
- What do you mean?

00:55.306 --> 00:56.682
I am miscarrying.

00:56.766 --> 00:59.727
Will you come with me,
or will you stay?

00:59.810 --> 01:01.645
<i>I will be back.
I love you.</i>

01:01.729 --> 01:03.230
<i>I didn't miscarry.</i>

01:03.314 --> 01:05.691
I was testing you
to see if you gave a shit.

01:05.775 --> 01:07.276
Good-bye, Frank.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.028
<i>Make it out to cash.</i>

01:09.111 --> 01:10.863
<i>You smell like booze.</i>

01:10.946 --> 01:12.865
- You're fired.
- What?

01:12.948 --> 01:14.116
Do you want to stay
with me here?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.743
Yeah, that'd be good.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.496
I'm with DCFS,
here to do a home safety check

01:18.579 --> 01:20.539
for a case opened up
by Phillip Gallagher.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.458
Any idea how much you
fucked this up for me?

01:22.541 --> 01:24.668
The old Fiona would've handled
this, would've spun shit,

01:24.752 --> 01:26.587
- would've covered for me.
- What was I supposed to do?

01:26.670 --> 01:28.756
I expected you to not be drunk
in the middle of the day.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.049
<i>DCFS showed up unannounced.</i>

01:30.132 --> 01:32.009
Fiona answered the door
fucking drunk.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.511
Okay, I'm pregnant.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.470
What are we gonna do?

01:34.553 --> 01:35.930
I don't know.

Uh, okay.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.230
Uh...

03:09.398 --> 03:11.400
Here you go.
Use this.

03:14.612 --> 03:16.238
Um...

03:17.656 --> 03:19.867
Jacket.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.036
It's a million degrees
outside.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.662
Yeah, just in case.

03:25.456 --> 03:26.999
Oh, you want some magazines?

03:27.082 --> 03:29.335
- No, thanks.
- No?

03:29.418 --> 03:30.794
Uh...

03:30.878 --> 03:32.922
your pillow,
can't forget that.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.506
That's your pillow.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.218
Yeah, but you love it.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.094
Go on, take it.

03:40.262 --> 03:42.389
Okay, are you hungry?

03:42.473 --> 03:43.891
Want me to make you
something to eat or...

03:43.974 --> 03:45.267
We just had breakfast.

03:45.351 --> 03:48.354
Yeah, but, uh, for the road.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.855
You want a sandwich
or something?

03:49.939 --> 03:50.940
No, thanks.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.691
No?

03:52.775 --> 03:54.860
All right.

03:54.944 --> 03:57.363
Um...

03:57.446 --> 04:00.532
listen, I'll, um--
I'll come visit you,

04:00.616 --> 04:02.326
okay, you know, as soon
as you get settled.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.535
Okay.

04:03.619 --> 04:04.912
I'm really sorry
you have to leave.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.413
You know, but I think

04:06.497 --> 04:08.374
it's the best thing
for you right now.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.458
Yeah.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.252
It's gonna be fine.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.757
All right.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.720
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.349
Well, how is everybody today?

04:25.432 --> 04:26.308
Good.

04:26.392 --> 04:28.018
Xan, you okay?

04:28.102 --> 04:29.561
Yeah.

04:29.645 --> 04:33.190
Good, good.
You, uh, ready to go?

04:33.274 --> 04:34.650
I think so.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.027
Okay, hey, um, you, uh...
you got your phone?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.362
Yeah.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.489
- And it's charged?
- Yeah.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.241
Okay.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.078
All right.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.332
Hey, you, um...
you call me

04:50.416 --> 04:52.251
when you get there,
all right,

04:52.334 --> 04:54.128
just let me know
you're safe?

04:55.796 --> 04:56.839
All right.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.217
And here, um,

05:00.301 --> 05:01.885
I got this
for you for, uh...

05:01.969 --> 05:05.681
for-for snacks and stuff,
you know, whatever you need.

05:05.764 --> 05:06.890
Oh.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.560
I made this for you.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.603
Oh, yeah?

05:11.687 --> 05:13.480
Uh, where'd you learn
how to make these?

05:13.564 --> 05:15.566
Kelly taught me.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.859
You know I can't
wear this, right?

05:16.942 --> 05:19.403
I'll get the shit
beat out of me.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.447
I'm the pink
and you're the purple.

05:22.448 --> 05:24.825
You know there's an old man
sleeping out front here?

05:24.908 --> 05:26.493
Yeah.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.704
Okay.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.497
Are we ready?

05:30.581 --> 05:32.333
Yeah.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.418
Okay, I'll talk
to you soon.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.128
Don't be mad.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.588
It's no one's fault.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.516
- What's that?
- It's Fiona's shit.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.851
Why is Fiona's shit
in trash bags?

06:32.935 --> 06:34.645
'Cause I told her to leave
and she's still here.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.938
Thought I'd give her a hand.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.399
'Cause of Xan?

06:38.482 --> 06:41.735
Yeah, 'cause of Xan
and Jason

06:41.819 --> 06:43.278
and all the other
fucking things.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.613
Okay.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.031
Look, I'll see you later,
all right?

06:46.115 --> 06:48.117
I gotta catch Tami
before work.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.701
You guys get into
a fight or something?

06:49.785 --> 06:52.913
No, she, uh...
she's pregnant.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.498
Holy shit.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.833
She gonna keep it?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.418
Uh, I have no idea.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.627
That'd be so cool.

06:58.710 --> 06:59.753
Franny could have
a little cousin.

06:59.837 --> 07:00.921
Yeah, look, I don't know.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.089
I just found out
yesterday, Deb,

07:02.172 --> 07:03.424
so I don't know what
the fuck we're gonna do.

07:03.507 --> 07:04.967
You guys
could all live here.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.051
Tami and I can
take turns babysitting.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.511
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.888
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.599
You want
a cousin, right?

07:12.683 --> 07:14.476
Uncle Lip's baby.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.648
Good morning,
former coworker.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.275
Here we go.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.985
No need to panic, Eliza.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.321
I'm just here
for my final paycheck.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.323
Okay, sure.

07:28.407 --> 07:29.450
I'll be right back.

07:29.533 --> 07:30.826
Thanks.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.496
Hey, you got my tip-out?

07:34.580 --> 07:35.622
What?

07:35.706 --> 07:36.832
My tip-out.

07:36.915 --> 07:37.916
My share of the ti--

07:38.000 --> 07:39.460
You know what a tip-out is,
Karina.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.794
Where are my tips?

07:40.878 --> 07:44.339
Um, well, we didn't think
that you were...

07:44.423 --> 07:46.925
You guys just stole
my fucking tips?

07:47.009 --> 07:49.136
Wow, that is cold.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.346
That's okay,
I'll just take this.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.265
Thank you.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.101
Oh, hey, what's up, Judas?

07:58.479 --> 08:00.689
Hey, winner.

08:03.442 --> 08:06.945
I'd refill your coffee,
but I don't work here anymore,

08:07.029 --> 08:08.447
so...

08:09.698 --> 08:11.533
Here you go.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.662
- Oh...
- Jesus.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.789
...you know those eggs aren't
really cage-free, right?

08:17.873 --> 08:20.501
The menu's full of lies.
Enjoy.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.044
Have you been drinking?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.212
Have you?

08:23.295 --> 08:25.380
You're drunk.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.175
Fuck you, Eliza.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.468
You got your last paycheck.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.345
Please leave, or I'll have
to call the cops.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.097
Oh, the cops.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.682
Let's call them.

08:35.766 --> 08:39.436
They can find out
where my stolen tips went.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.833
Where's my
Buccaneer Biscuits at?

09:01.917 --> 09:02.918
KJ.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.711
Going as fast
as I can, Lori.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.423
Buccaneer Biscuits
selling like crazy.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.676
Adding fried clams to the
bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit

09:10.759 --> 09:12.219
was a great idea.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.470
Yeah? Thanks.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.888
Just a fry guy
with big ideas

09:14.972 --> 09:17.182
who wants to serve
his country.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.726
You ever read <i>The Tipping Point,</i>
Malcolm Gladwell?

09:19.810 --> 09:21.228
Uh, no.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.939
Buccaneer Biscuits,
tipping point.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.024
Trust me,
you're gonna go places.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.110
I sell weed
out the back.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.611
I know you do, KJ,

09:29.695 --> 09:31.863
and I appreciate your desire
for a better life.

09:31.947 --> 09:34.616
But Carl here,
he's helping us sell shit

09:34.700 --> 09:36.660
inside the store, okay?

09:36.743 --> 09:40.038
You know, they used
to call this place Mr. Bob's.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.707
They started calling it
Captain Bob's

09:41.790 --> 09:43.292
when they added seafood
to the menu.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.751
Now it's all seafood.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.838
That man's
a goddamn visionary.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.214
Can I take my break now?

09:49.298 --> 09:50.549
Sure, you can, rock star.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.301
- Be back in ten, okay?
- Yeah.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.052
Mmm, mmm.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.560
Hey, Kelly, it's me.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.312
I'm at work right now.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.147
You know those
Buccaneer Biscuits?

10:05.230 --> 10:06.648
They're a huge hit.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.483
Yeah, it was my idea.
Did you know that?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.360
So I'm pretty hyped about that.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.487
You know, I should probably
be getting back to it, though,

10:12.571 --> 10:14.781
so just want to make sure
softball's going well.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.034
Uh, give me a call later,
all right?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.827
Bye. Miss and love you.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.537
Bye.

10:29.046 --> 10:32.424
Ugh, feels like someone
kicked me in the balls.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.051
Well, the heat
doesn't help.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.510
You gotta get some AC
in here, man.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.262
We have an AC.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.182
Thing's on its last legs,

10:40.265 --> 10:41.850
givin' it all she's got.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.811
Oh.

10:44.895 --> 10:48.273
V, is there a kid kicking me
in the nuts right now?

10:48.357 --> 10:49.650
'Cause it feels like
there's a child

10:49.733 --> 10:51.276
repeatedly kicking me
in the balls.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.487
No, baby,
just leave ice on it.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.030
Be better in no time,
Kev. Hang in there, man.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.657
Yeah, hang in there,
buddy.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.741
What's up?

10:57.824 --> 11:00.077
Hey.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.328
What's going on with him?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.372
He had a vasectomy,
little swelling.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.498
Little swelling?

11:04.581 --> 11:06.458
My ball's the size
of a grapefruit, V.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.001
Why didn't V
just tie her tubes?

11:08.085 --> 11:09.711
Old-school, piece of cake.

11:09.795 --> 11:10.796
Okay, I'm right here.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.047
I'll take this one.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.298
Do you even know
what you're saying?

11:13.382 --> 11:15.717
A vasectomy is like this,

11:15.801 --> 11:18.095
really, on one ball,

11:18.178 --> 11:19.680
and it's already
on the outside of your body.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.181
My shit is on the inside.

11:21.264 --> 11:24.101
They have to cut
into my stomach twice,

11:24.184 --> 11:26.520
pull my tubes
out of my body,

11:26.603 --> 11:29.022
rope 'em off, and then
put 'em back inside me.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.440
I should slap your face.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.441
Sorry, V.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.567
You gon' live, baby.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.195
What is that?

11:35.278 --> 11:37.781
Final paycheck.
Can you cash it?

11:37.864 --> 11:40.450
Come on, it's only,
like, 115 bucks.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.706
Oh, no, keep it.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.916
I am ready to drink.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.209
What you havin'?

11:49.292 --> 11:50.293
Vodka.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.670
- Straight?
- Yeah.

11:55.841 --> 11:59.177
Whoop, I made
a vodka and cranberry.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.096
My bad.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.098
I'll make you some breakfast.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.768
What the fuck?

12:11.857 --> 12:13.525
Oh.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.072
Everyone, remain calm.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.408
- Why would we not remain--
- Tsk, tsk.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.952
People do crazy shit
when the power goes out.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.040
Hey, you guys got power?

12:29.124 --> 12:31.168
No, you?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.628
Mrs. Williams,
do you have power?

12:33.712 --> 12:36.006
No.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.307
Blackout.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.856

I have a generator.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.716
Of course you do. Wow.

13:20.592 --> 13:24.679
No one in this neighborhood
ever plans ahead.

13:24.763 --> 13:27.015
The future is scary,
Professor.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.683
It's easier
not to think about.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.310
Unless there's money
to be made.

13:31.853 --> 13:35.482
So, um, how much?

13:35.565 --> 13:38.527
Cost plus 20 percent.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.196
Cost plus ten?

13:41.279 --> 13:43.990
Okay, okay, 15.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.953
Any word how long
this is gonna last?

13:48.036 --> 13:49.579
Too soon to say,

13:49.663 --> 13:52.833
but I'll see you in an hour
if we still got a blackout.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.376
All right.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.546
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

13:57.629 --> 14:00.423
V, calm down.
It's just a blackout.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.509
The power will
come back on eventually.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.386
- It's not a big deal.
- When?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.429
I'm sure they're
already working on it.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.722
The whole city's out.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.266
They don't know how long
it's gonna be.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.270
Babe, what is going on?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.231
What?

14:16.314 --> 14:17.732
The steaks.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.317
Steaks, what steaks?

14:23.697 --> 14:25.448
I bought 16 cases of rib eye

14:25.532 --> 14:28.159
and a case
of crab-stuffed sole.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.452
What, in here?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.538
Well, don't open it!

14:31.621 --> 14:33.081
Why do we have
a freezer full of meat?

14:33.164 --> 14:35.458
I got it from a guy
who said his truck broke down.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.710
Gave me a good deal.

14:36.793 --> 14:37.794
You did what?

14:37.878 --> 14:38.962
Now it's all gonna go bad

14:39.045 --> 14:41.006
unless the power
comes back on soon.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.091
How much did you
pay for this?

14:44.175 --> 14:45.552
Five hundred.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.178
What, $500?

14:47.262 --> 14:49.431
I was gonna do
a surf and turf special,

14:49.514 --> 14:52.684
28 bucks, call it
Funk Sole Brother.

14:52.767 --> 14:53.977
I don't get it.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.813
Sole, S-O-L-E,
Funk <i>Sole</i> Brother.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.523
Oh, yeah.

14:58.607 --> 14:59.983
We would've made
over 3,500 bucks.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.443
No, it's a great idea,

15:01.526 --> 15:02.777
if we had electricity!

15:02.861 --> 15:04.696
Why do you think
I've been freaking out?

15:04.779 --> 15:06.615
This is the worst thing
that has ever happened.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.199
Anne Frank
might beg to differ.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.827
Just a minute ago, you were
telling me to calm down,

15:10.911 --> 15:12.203
this is just a blackout.

15:12.287 --> 15:15.582
That's before I knew we had
a freezer full of meat.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.208
Fuck the meat.
I need ice for my balls.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.585
I could die.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.045
We need to sell the meat.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.088
- We need ice for my balls!
- And cocktails.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.548
The beer's gonna be warm.

15:23.632 --> 15:24.883
Nothin' new there.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.092
I'm panicking.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.093
I'm having a panic attack.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.428
I'm hyperventilating.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.013
What are we gonna do?

15:30.096 --> 15:32.682
Can I get another vodka cran
while there's still ice?

15:34.225 --> 15:35.894
I need a paper bag.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.479
I need a paper bag!

15:37.562 --> 15:38.647
I-I gotta close up.

15:38.730 --> 15:39.648
I can't open the register.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.358
I can't microwave shit.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.610
- So can we leave?
- Leave?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.737
This is the perfect time
for a kitchen deep clean.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.739
Start breaking down the grill
and the fryers.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.407
It's, like, 90 degrees
in here, Lori.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.327
Unsafe work environment,
unsafe work environment.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.037
KJ, you were in prison.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.246
How was that work environment?

15:55.330 --> 15:56.790
Unsafe.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.291
You can, uh,
clean out the freezer.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.668
Oh, sweet.

15:59.751 --> 16:00.794
Uh, what about
the stuff in the freezer?

16:00.877 --> 16:02.337
Will it go bad?

16:02.420 --> 16:04.047
We never said the seafood
was fresh here.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.466
Yeah, besides,
the clams, cod, and shrimp--

16:06.549 --> 16:08.551
all just a delivery system
for tartar sauce.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.636
God.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.846
You just get it.
God.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.224
So can I leave anyways?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.685
What the hell do you have to do
that's so urgent?

16:16.768 --> 16:18.061
Nothing.

16:19.562 --> 16:23.149
Come on, you know you can
talk to me about anything.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.275
I want to hang out with Kelly.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.527
Oh, not this shit again.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.611
She's being weird.

16:26.695 --> 16:27.988
Can I give you some advice?

16:28.071 --> 16:29.864
- Not really.
- Back the fuck off.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.116
All right,
give her some space.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.118
Women hate clingy guys.

16:33.201 --> 16:36.204
But also, it's a blackout.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.706
Blackouts mean sex.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.499
There's nothin' else to do.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.210
This is your chance
to win back your lady.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.839
Also, stick your finger
in her butt.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.257
Chicks like that.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.633
- Right.
- She religious?

16:48.717 --> 16:50.176
Uh, pretty much.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.803
Finger that ass,

16:51.886 --> 16:53.471
but put it
in your mouth first.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.724
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.115
Hey.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.826
<i>Hey, did you get my message?</i>

17:14.909 --> 17:17.245
Uh, no, we're not supposed
to be on our phones.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.747
Oh, yeah, no problem.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.290
You know there's a blackout,
whole city.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.708
- What?
- Keefe!

17:21.791 --> 17:23.293
- Off the phone now!
- Shit, hey, I gotta go.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.252
Okay, bye.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.337
Uh, later.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.889
Hey.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.266
- Hi.
- Hey, can we talk?

17:38.349 --> 17:39.642
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.269
We need to talk.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.648
- I'll be back in one minute.
- Okay.

17:47.776 --> 17:48.860
What the hell, dude?

17:48.943 --> 17:50.779
Are you having the baby
or not?

17:51.738 --> 17:52.989
I have no idea.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.449
Well, we need
to talk about it.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.076
"We"? Oh, no, there's
no fucking "we" in this.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.911
- This is my decision.
- All right, fine,

17:57.994 --> 17:59.871
then what do you think
you're gonna do?

17:59.954 --> 18:02.665
Okay, first, this doesn't
involve you at all,

18:02.749 --> 18:04.042
so you can go back to--

18:04.125 --> 18:05.794
Yeah, it does
involve me, though.

18:05.877 --> 18:06.753
- Okay, fuck off. I'm not--
- All right, wait, wait.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.505
All right? I'm sorry.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.881
I'm sorry, all right?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.716
I just--I want
to talk about this.

18:11.800 --> 18:12.926
All right, I mean,
we need a plan, right?

18:13.009 --> 18:14.552
Stop saying "we."

18:14.636 --> 18:15.637
Okay, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.596
Shh!

18:16.679 --> 18:18.556
I just...

18:19.516 --> 18:22.811
If you decide to have the baby,
I-I want to be a part of it.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.395
Okay.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.064
Fine.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.565
Okay.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.109
I gotta--

18:29.192 --> 18:31.736
Look, DCFS came this morning

18:31.820 --> 18:34.364
and took Xan.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.199
It's fucking with me
a little.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.951
Yeah, you think?

18:39.828 --> 18:43.748
Look, I'm sorry about Xan.
I am.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.835
But I've only known I was
pregnant for two days,

18:46.918 --> 18:50.213
so I don't know
what I'm gonna do yet, okay?

18:50.296 --> 18:53.007
- All right.
- But I got this.

18:53.091 --> 18:56.386
Also, I gotta
get back to work, all right?

18:59.931 --> 19:01.307
Hey, sorry about that.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.228
Morning, Sweathogs.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.896
Blackout,
we got a blackout.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.273
No shit, Frank.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.900
That's why we're all
sitting here in the dark.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.027
Is the beer still cold?

19:13.111 --> 19:14.195
Not really.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.197
Sounds great.
I'll take one.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.907
What are you doing here?

19:17.991 --> 19:19.033
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

19:19.117 --> 19:21.202
I got fired.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.371
Well, congratulations.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.248
You apply
for unemployment yet?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.749
My advice is, do it in person.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.959
If you do it online,

19:28.042 --> 19:29.669
they'll pretend
they never got the application.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.254
Got it.

19:31.337 --> 19:35.175
Well, welcome to the ranks
of the unemployed.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.467
Yeah, I'm fine with it.

19:36.551 --> 19:37.886
I mean, fuck them.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.637
Being broke sucks,
though.

19:39.721 --> 19:40.763
Ah, you get used to it.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.891
You just gotta be creative.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.435
Buy me a beer?

19:45.518 --> 19:48.146
That's funny.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.899
You know, life is not
all sunshine and rainbows

19:50.982 --> 19:53.026
for me either, kiddo.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.236
Ingrid left me.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.155
Took all my children
with her.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.907
I'm still here.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.325
My unborn children.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.577
I don't think
I'll ever get over it.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.704
V, a shot of Jame-o, please.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.834
Oh, my God, ow.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.254
What's his problem?

20:14.672 --> 20:16.966
Vasectomy.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.509
Smart.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.178
A substation blew up.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.180
Gonna be at least
another 18 hours

20:22.263 --> 20:23.514
before the power's back up.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.099
- What?
- God damn it.

20:25.183 --> 20:27.602
Oh, we're screwed.

20:27.685 --> 20:28.978
I'll be back.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.439
Where is he going?

20:31.522 --> 20:32.857
If you need a little
walking-around money,

20:32.941 --> 20:34.776
you should hang out
with me today.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.654
Why would I do that?

20:37.737 --> 20:40.782
Because of a little something
I like to call

20:40.865 --> 20:44.369
"monetizing my neighbors'
lack of foresight."

20:44.452 --> 20:45.828
You mean rippin' people off.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.372
Completely legit.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.582
No one prepares
for blackouts around here,

20:49.666 --> 20:50.959
so they rush to the store

20:51.042 --> 20:53.503
for ice or batteries
or what have you.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.004
Too late,
everything's sold out.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.173
Panic ensues,
and where there's panic,

20:57.257 --> 20:58.883
there's money to be made.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.635
That's where I come in.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.012
Frank's Blackout Supply
has everything you need.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.264
So you gouge 'em.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.807
Really?

21:05.890 --> 21:09.477
How's the view from up there,
Miss High and Mighty?

21:09.560 --> 21:12.188
Last time I checked, we were
in the same freakin' bar

21:12.272 --> 21:14.399
drinking warm beer together.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.775
Fair point.

21:15.858 --> 21:19.279
Do I charge a little more?
Yes.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.239
Double.

21:21.322 --> 21:25.618
The peace of mind of a candle
or fresh batteries, priceless.

21:25.702 --> 21:26.786
So you in or out?

21:26.869 --> 21:27.829
No, thanks.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.205
Aw, come on.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.540
I could use a pretty face.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.875
It legitimizes
the whole thing.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.253
What's in it for me?

21:35.336 --> 21:36.879
After I recoup my cost,
20 percent.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.298
Seventy.

21:38.381 --> 21:41.050
Jesus Ch--
Who's gouging now? Thirty.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.593
Fifty percent, final offer.

21:42.677 --> 21:45.138
No one's gonna buy
anything from you, Frank.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.389
You're Frank.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.562
Deal, 50.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.856
Gallagher Blackout Supply.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.858
Oh, Jesus.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.617
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:06.701 --> 22:08.286
How we supposed
to get food?

22:08.369 --> 22:09.912
We're not.
Fridge is gonna stay shut

22:09.996 --> 22:11.497
until the power's back on.

22:11.581 --> 22:12.874
I thought you had work.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.001
I did. Got canceled
'cause of the blackout.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.003
Yeah, mine too.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.758
Who's that?

22:21.841 --> 22:23.801
Kelly. This girl's insane.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.803
She's not supposed
to be on her phone.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.138
Well, she is.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.014
Because you keep texting her.

22:28.097 --> 22:28.973
Stop texting her.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.017
Carl, relax,
we're friends.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.145
Oh, my God.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.605
Yo, what the fuck
is so funny?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.023
You are.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.441
Look at you.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.650
Debs, I'm serious.
Stop texting her.

22:39.734 --> 22:40.943
Nobody likes a clinger.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.320
Whatever, I gotta go.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.529
Go where?

22:43.613 --> 22:44.989
Going to Kelly's scrimmage.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.074
Gonna bring her
some orange Gatorade.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.617
She needs to stay hydrated.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.369
What the fuck, you're going
to her practices now?

22:49.452 --> 22:50.536
It's a scrimmage.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.871
Okay, plus, you don't need

22:51.954 --> 22:53.206
to be worrying about her
being hydrated.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.583
That's my job,
and she likes lemon-lime.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.210
Hmm, she asked for orange.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.795
Orange, what the fuck?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.713
Carl, relax,
we're friends.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.256
All right, well, I'm gonna
go, too, and bring her

23:02.340 --> 23:04.008
what she really likes,
lemon-lime Gatorade.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.468
Don't forget about Franny,
by the way.

23:45.508 --> 23:46.592
Should we get ice cream?

23:46.676 --> 23:48.428
Too soon.
Give it another hour.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.221
The stores'll panic.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.848
They'll try to unload it
before it thaws.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.099
They'll drop the price.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.101

I told ya, kiddo,

24:02.525 --> 24:04.569
just gotta stay creative.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.488
I know where we might be able
to get some real ice.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.532
- No shit?
- Mm-hmm.

24:12.535 --> 24:14.328
What are you looking for?

24:14.412 --> 24:17.582
A wagon, something
to put my supplies in.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.167
A wagon?

24:19.250 --> 24:21.210
No, if we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right,

24:21.294 --> 24:23.629
not some half-assed
wagon situation.

24:23.713 --> 24:25.339
We gotta, like,
build a stand.

24:25.423 --> 24:26.549
Like a booth?

24:26.632 --> 24:28.092
Take half a day
to set up.

24:28.176 --> 24:30.052
No, it won't.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.054
Hey, here, help me.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.514
What are we doing?

24:33.598 --> 24:35.183
We're being creative.

24:35.266 --> 24:36.434

24:38.603 --> 24:40.313

No, they did.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.295
I already made a copy.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.380
To a hardware store,
"do not duplicate"

25:06.464 --> 25:09.717
means "do not duplicate
unless I give you ten bucks."

25:11.010 --> 25:12.637

25:12.720 --> 25:14.847

25:16.265 --> 25:18.643

I know.

25:37.662 --> 25:38.913
Why isn't she calling?

25:38.996 --> 25:40.665
I left her, like,
five messages.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.543
- Who?
- Xan.

25:43.626 --> 25:46.879
Fuck!
God damn it, man.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.464
Why are we
even open today?

25:48.548 --> 25:52.134
'Cause Mr. Ryland's heading
to Sturgis and needs his bike.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.846
What's going on
with you, man?

25:55.930 --> 25:58.266
Tami's pregnant.

25:58.349 --> 25:59.809
What?

26:02.186 --> 26:03.563
Yeah.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.648
Is it yours?

26:05.731 --> 26:08.109
She says it is.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.528
Oh, no,
you got Tami pregnant?

26:10.611 --> 26:11.821
Yeah, so?

26:11.904 --> 26:12.822
I can't believe
you got Tami pregnant.

26:12.905 --> 26:13.906
Why do you keep saying that?

26:13.990 --> 26:14.991
Well--

26:15.074 --> 26:18.286
Hey, honey, Core.

26:18.369 --> 26:19.495
I'm terrified
of these women.

26:19.579 --> 26:20.580
What, even your wife?

26:20.663 --> 26:21.998
Terrified.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.332
Did he tell you?

26:23.416 --> 26:24.625
What? No.
I don't know anything.

26:24.709 --> 26:25.835
Did you tell him?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.128
No.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.630
Sorry, I got
a conference call

26:29.714 --> 26:33.301
with a parts, uh, guy.

26:33.384 --> 26:35.136
You upset Tami.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.304
Yeah, Tami's upset.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.513
Now we gotta fuck you up.

26:37.597 --> 26:38.931
Well, she didn't
seem that upset.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.141
I mean, how could you tell?

26:40.224 --> 26:41.851
She was fucking crying, Lip.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.227
Tami was crying, really?

26:43.311 --> 26:44.520
What the fuck
did you say to her?

26:44.604 --> 26:45.563
Nothing, all right?

26:45.646 --> 26:46.772
Uh, we talked about the baby,

26:46.856 --> 26:47.898
I said I want
to be a part of it,

26:47.982 --> 26:49.567
and it's her decision.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.277
Goddamn right
it's her decision.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.820
If she does
decide to keep it,

26:52.903 --> 26:54.405
you better not ghost her.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.324
I won't, all right?
That's what I told her.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.409
If you hurt her,
we will fuck you up.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.077
Since when do you
give a shit about Tami, huh?

27:00.161 --> 27:01.162
I thought you hated her.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.371
We will fuck you up.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.832
Look, I get it, okay?

27:04.915 --> 27:06.334
I'm trying
to do the right thing.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.877
If she doesn't
want to be around me,

27:07.960 --> 27:10.087
I don't know
what I can do for you.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.505
Don't fuck with us.

27:11.589 --> 27:13.132
Okay.

27:15.092 --> 27:16.552
You know, you should
get your sister

27:16.636 --> 27:18.262
a mood ring or something,

27:18.346 --> 27:21.098
you know, anything that lets me
know how she's feeling.

27:21.182 --> 27:23.476
You know, that would be
great, all right?

27:32.109 --> 27:33.152

27:33.235 --> 27:34.487

27:34.570 --> 27:36.697

Uh, take the day off.

27:36.781 --> 27:37.907
I got this.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.159
Yeah, why?

27:40.701 --> 27:42.662
You're having a bad day.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.372

29:06.328 --> 29:08.289
You're a good salesman.

29:08.372 --> 29:09.498
What the fuck?

29:09.582 --> 29:11.333
You just need--

29:15.087 --> 29:16.547
These are my clothes.

29:17.673 --> 29:20.760
I'll take that chair
if you don't want it.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.553
Fuckin' Lip.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.638
God!

29:31.687 --> 29:32.938
- Hey!
- What the fuck?

29:33.022 --> 29:34.190
You put my shit
on the fucking curb?

29:34.273 --> 29:35.733
Fuck, man.
The f--

29:35.816 --> 29:37.193
- You can't fucking do that!
- Yeah, well,

29:37.276 --> 29:39.487
- I want you fucking out!
- This is my house!

29:39.570 --> 29:42.281
I live here!
I live here!

29:42.364 --> 29:43.616
This is my fucking house!

29:43.699 --> 29:44.867
Okay, okay, easy, easy, easy.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.202
- I own this house!
- Easy.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.703
The title is in my name!

29:47.787 --> 29:49.288
- I'm not letting you live here!
- Okay.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.665
All right, not with Liam
and not with Franny!

29:51.749 --> 29:52.875
No fucking way!

29:52.958 --> 29:54.293
- Fuck you!
- Look at you!

29:54.376 --> 29:56.086
All right,
you are fucking pathetic.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.380
You need to take
a personal fucking inventory!

29:58.464 --> 30:01.258
Did you say inven--
You?

30:01.342 --> 30:03.260
You AA people
are all the same.

30:03.344 --> 30:04.678
You want a goddamn parade
because you stand

30:04.762 --> 30:06.639
in front of other alcoholics

30:06.722 --> 30:08.516
and state
the galactically obvious.

30:08.599 --> 30:10.976
It's the very definition
of narcissism.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.354
Will you please take a drink
and shut the fuck up?

30:13.437 --> 30:14.438
Shut the fuck up!

30:14.522 --> 30:15.689
All right.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.819
Get to a meeting.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.297
You should spend
less time blaming her

30:40.381 --> 30:41.715
and more thanking her.

30:41.799 --> 30:42.800
Yeah, for what?

30:42.883 --> 30:44.009
For what?

30:44.093 --> 30:48.430
It's tough raising six kids
by yourself.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.143
I couldn't have done it
without her.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.520
<i>All right, team,</i>

30:54.603 --> 30:56.188
let's go!

31:01.777 --> 31:03.612
Let's go, Kelly!

31:13.080 --> 31:15.082
Nice throw, girl!

31:17.001 --> 31:19.795
I brought your favorite,
orange!

31:33.475 --> 31:34.685
This should be working.

31:34.768 --> 31:35.853
Stay out of there!

31:54.872 --> 31:56.874
I can see the steak
in your pants.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.752
Well, it doesn't matter anyway
'cause it's already thawed.

31:59.835 --> 32:03.088
Bartender, two vodka martinis

32:03.172 --> 32:05.424
on the rocks with a twist.

32:05.507 --> 32:06.592
There's no rocks, Frank.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.510
It's over 100 degrees in here.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.012
It's the end of days.

32:10.888 --> 32:12.765
We're all gonna die.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.101
How the hell
are you not sweating?

32:16.185 --> 32:19.688
He wears flannel pajamas
in August with the windows open.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.023
And how do you know that?

32:21.106 --> 32:22.524
I'm guessing.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.361
I gotta take my pants off.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.321
My balls are gonna explode.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.322
It's a ticking time ball.

32:28.405 --> 32:29.531
Hey,

32:29.615 --> 32:31.241
you need ice?
We got ice.

32:31.325 --> 32:32.743
- Really?
- Hundred bucks a bag.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.411
- Great.
- Hell no!

32:34.495 --> 32:36.872
V, this whole thing
was your idea.

32:36.956 --> 32:37.957
Fifty.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.792
- Okay.
- No!

32:39.875 --> 32:40.876
All right, fine.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.128
When my balls explode
and everybody in here

32:43.212 --> 32:44.838
is covered in blood and ball,
we'll see who's laughing then.

32:44.922 --> 32:45.923
I won't be.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.384
It's fucking hot, okay?

32:48.467 --> 32:49.468
Who wants a beer?

32:49.551 --> 32:51.720
- Me.
- Me, I want one.

32:51.804 --> 32:52.805
I'll take one.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.140
$20 apiece.

32:55.224 --> 32:56.976
$50 for a bag of ice.

32:57.059 --> 32:58.394
You're just like my vendors.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.562
Just like everyone
in this city,

33:00.646 --> 33:03.399
always trying to take advantage
of the South Side.

33:04.566 --> 33:05.943
Hey, I got an idea.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.653
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, no,

33:07.736 --> 33:09.154
this is a really good one.

33:09.238 --> 33:10.406
Let's have a cookout,

33:10.489 --> 33:11.615
invite the whole neighborhood.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.158
We got all that meat
that's gonna spoil.

33:13.242 --> 33:14.994
And the crab-stuffed sole.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.954
Free surf and turf
and warm beer.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.039
No, not free, $5 surf and turf.

33:19.123 --> 33:20.916
We gotta at least
try to make our money back.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.626
Okay, it's still
a pretty good deal.

33:22.710 --> 33:25.045
Y-you guys would pay five bucks
for surf and turf, right?

33:25.129 --> 33:26.422
- A rib eye, yeah.
- Yeah.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.173
Cookout at The Alibi.

33:28.257 --> 33:29.967
If people bring
grills and charcoal,

33:30.050 --> 33:31.927
- I'll supply the meat and beer.
- Nice.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.262
- I like it.
- Yes.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.722

34:24.938 --> 34:27.608
He's a righteous fuckin' prick.

34:27.691 --> 34:30.694
V, can we get a couple
of shots of Jame-o?

34:30.778 --> 34:31.779
Who cares?

34:31.862 --> 34:33.280
You know how many times
I've kicked out of that house?

34:33.363 --> 34:34.364
Yeah, I do.

34:34.448 --> 34:36.742
I was the one
doing the kickin'.

34:36.825 --> 34:37.993
Lip kicked you
out of the house?

34:38.077 --> 34:39.411
Yeah, you believe
that motherfucker?

34:39.495 --> 34:41.914
I'm carrying my shit around
in garbage bags.

34:41.997 --> 34:45.417
V, can I just crash with you
just till I figure it out?

34:46.126 --> 34:47.878
You don't even have to ask.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.255
You're the shit!

34:50.339 --> 34:53.175
We made a shitload of money
out there today.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.177
You're really good at this.

34:57.179 --> 34:58.722
I'm great.

35:01.058 --> 35:02.601
Here's your half.

35:03.310 --> 35:04.728
I want to renegotiate.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.856
The hell?
There's no renegotiation.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.149
We made a deal.

35:09.233 --> 35:12.027
See, you were gonna
walk around with a wagon.

35:12.111 --> 35:15.989
I created a store.
I got us ice.

35:16.073 --> 35:17.199
Sixty-forty.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.283
No way.

35:18.367 --> 35:19.660
Sixty-forty, or next time,

35:19.743 --> 35:22.496
I just open
my own blackout supply.

35:22.579 --> 35:25.999
And trust me, you don't
want me as your competition.

35:29.086 --> 35:31.255
You're worse than the Mafia,
you know that?

35:31.338 --> 35:32.589
Mm-hmm.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.717
And this is
for the professor.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.886
We did all the work.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.263
And he supplied
the raw materials.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.265
Oh, fuck the professor.

35:41.348 --> 35:45.519
Okay, it's time
we had a little chat.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.271
V, could we get
two more of these?

35:47.354 --> 35:49.106
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.983
You're a bad drunk.

35:53.694 --> 35:55.487
That's...

35:55.571 --> 35:59.366
Oh, well, if that isn't the pot
callin' the kettle black.

35:59.449 --> 36:00.742
No, no, no,
I'm a good drunk.

36:00.826 --> 36:01.827
Makes me happy.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.537
When you drink, you get mean.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.039
If it wasn't for me,
Lip would be dead right now.

36:06.123 --> 36:09.376
Are you seriously telling me
to stop drinkin'?

36:09.459 --> 36:11.837
I would never say that
to my worst enemy.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.799
No, I am telling you there are
good drunks and bad drunks.

36:15.883 --> 36:17.634
A good drunk is fun.

36:17.718 --> 36:19.636
A bad drunk
wants to have a fight.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.680
A good drunk
lives in the present.

36:21.763 --> 36:24.892
A bad drunk
is thinking about yesterday.

36:24.975 --> 36:29.730
It's all about
gas and the brakes.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.565
Bottoms up.

36:34.484 --> 36:36.028
How you feel?

36:36.111 --> 36:37.070
Great.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.030
Wanna do another one?

36:38.113 --> 36:40.032
- Yeah.
- No.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.534
You feel good, right?

36:42.618 --> 36:44.661
So take a break,
driver eight.

36:44.745 --> 36:47.456
Take your foot off the gas
for a couple of seconds.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.082
Coast.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.793
Alcohol was created
to distract us

36:51.877 --> 36:54.254
from existential dread.

36:54.796 --> 36:57.466
Human beings
are the only species

36:57.549 --> 36:59.176
that knows
of its own mortality,

36:59.259 --> 37:00.594
and I gotta say,

37:00.677 --> 37:03.722
we do a pretty good job
dealing with that fact.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.474
Thank God for alcohol.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.185
Can you imagine
having to live

37:08.268 --> 37:10.812
with impending death
sober?

37:10.896 --> 37:14.316
Look at Lip. When's the last
time you saw him smile?

37:14.399 --> 37:16.443
Me, I've always been

37:16.526 --> 37:18.403
the most fun member
of this family.

37:18.487 --> 37:21.198
You know why?
Because I get it.

37:21.698 --> 37:24.910
Sobriety is a fool's game.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.037
Okay, okay!

37:27.120 --> 37:29.498
Who's ready for a cookout?

37:29.581 --> 37:31.583
- Let's do this!
- Oh! Meat!

37:32.334 --> 37:33.585
Let me help you with that.

37:33.669 --> 37:34.795
Thanks.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.506
You were really great
out there.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.883
Yeah, played okay.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.770
Hey, come on,
get in the back.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.105
You get in the back.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.116
Fine.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.080
I got a text.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.206
They're having a cookout
at The Alibi.

38:11.290 --> 38:12.291
You want to go?

38:12.374 --> 38:13.458
Let's do it.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.627
Yeah, sure,
you can come with us.

38:20.716 --> 38:23.260
Two Funk Sole Brothers,
well done.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.095
Two Funk Sole Brothers,
well done.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.888
Two beers.

38:26.972 --> 38:27.973
- Here.
- No, uh-uh,

38:28.056 --> 38:29.099
I'm not counting that shit.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.434
Walk away.

38:31.018 --> 38:33.395
V, we're doin' it, baby.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.732
This is how we do it
on the South Side, man.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.651
We learn how to live together
because alone, we die.

38:39.735 --> 38:41.945
Is Chicago dangerous?
Yes.

38:42.029 --> 38:43.572
Is Chicago big?
Doesn't matter,

38:43.655 --> 38:45.866
'cause I don't live in Chicago.
I live on the South Side,

38:45.949 --> 38:47.576
and these are the people
I care about.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.161
South Side!

38:49.244 --> 38:51.580
Carl thinks if two women
are friends, they must be gay.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.457
No, I don't think that.
I think Debbie's gay

38:53.540 --> 38:55.125
because she follows you around
like a little puppy dog.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.626
Ha, see what I mean?

38:56.710 --> 38:57.919
I'm not kidding.
She's in love with you.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.171
Carl, stop.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.797
You're acting crazy.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.382
Yeah, seriously,
who's the puppy dog?

39:02.466 --> 39:04.134
- She's my girlfriend.
- She's my friend.

39:04.217 --> 39:06.470
Okay, I'm gonna get a beer.

39:06.553 --> 39:07.637
- Let me get it for you.
- I'll come with you.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.932
Guys, I got it,
thanks.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.101

39:24.654 --> 39:26.490
It's on me.

39:26.573 --> 39:28.033

39:28.116 --> 39:29.284
It's melting.

Thank you, man. Ah.

39:31.244 --> 39:32.662

39:34.623 --> 39:36.708
We brought this

39:36.792 --> 39:38.668
Global warming.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.003
Nothing to be done.
Too late.

39:40.087 --> 39:41.880
What, I'm gonna
turn my AC off?

39:41.963 --> 39:45.550

What are you talking about?

40:12.077 --> 40:13.829
My cousin's on his way
to the Cubs game.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.539
North Side's
already got power.

<i>♪♪ More that you came here-- ♪♪</i>

40:20.460 --> 40:22.879

The what?

40:24.047 --> 40:25.549
Jerk-off AM, who knows?

40:25.632 --> 40:27.509
No, seriously, no one knows
the station for the Cubs game?

40:27.592 --> 40:29.553
- The fuck we care?
- Go, Sox.

40:30.137 --> 40:32.514
God bless us, every one.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.268
<i>Power's been restored
to 90 percent of the city,</i>

40:36.351 --> 40:39.062
<i>and the Cubs will play
tonight as scheduled.</i>

40:39.146 --> 40:41.648
So everybody's got power
except us?

40:41.731 --> 40:43.483
Wrigleyville has power.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.402
Fucking yuppies,
what do you expect?

40:45.485 --> 40:47.737
South Side's
always last in line.

40:47.821 --> 40:50.740
So we're the working poor.
No one gives a fuck about us.

40:50.824 --> 40:53.201
We don't matter.
We don't count.

40:53.285 --> 40:54.536
Well, I don't know about you,

40:54.619 --> 40:57.247
but I am sick
of gettin' fucked.

40:57.330 --> 40:58.582
Yeah!

40:58.665 --> 41:02.461
I say we march right now
to Wrigleyville

41:02.544 --> 41:05.338
and kick every one
of their fuckin' asses!

41:05.422 --> 41:06.715
- Fuck 'em up!
- Yeah!

41:06.798 --> 41:07.799
In this heat?

41:07.883 --> 41:09.384
We are South Side,
God damn it!

41:09.468 --> 41:11.428
- We are not your bitch!
- Yeah!

41:11.511 --> 41:13.680
- Fuck yeah.
- This shit stops now.

41:13.763 --> 41:16.683
My bitch!
South Side!

41:21.771 --> 41:23.356
I'm staying.
Any medium rares?

41:23.440 --> 41:24.900
If they think I'm walkin'
in these damn heels...

41:24.983 --> 41:26.526
Ooh, man.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.069
- Yeah, I'll take that guy.
- That smoke is--

41:28.153 --> 41:30.071
- I'm gonna start cleaning up.
- All right.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.698
What the fuck, Chicago?

41:31.781 --> 41:33.700
Should've had power
hours ago!

41:33.783 --> 41:35.660
What the fuck, Chicago?

41:35.744 --> 41:37.579
Should've had power
hours ago!

41:37.662 --> 41:39.498
What the fuck, Chicago?

41:39.581 --> 41:40.624
Should've had power
hours ago!

41:40.707 --> 41:41.917
Hey, can we talk?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.752
Now? We're in the middle
of a protest.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.795
Yeah, but you're not even
from the South Side.

41:45.879 --> 41:46.922
I know.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.007
Injustice is injustice.

41:49.090 --> 41:50.884
What the fuck, Chicago?

41:50.967 --> 41:52.928
Should've had power
hours ago!

41:53.011 --> 41:54.679
What the fuck, Chicago?

41:54.763 --> 41:56.723
Should've had power
hours ago!

42:08.401 --> 42:12.906
Hey, Xan, uh, it's me again.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.450
Um...

42:15.534 --> 42:17.786
look, can you call me back?

42:17.869 --> 42:20.080
Yeah, I know there's the-the
power outage and everything,

42:20.163 --> 42:24.626
but seriously, you know,
just...call me back.

42:30.966 --> 42:32.676
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:32.759 --> 42:35.512
Hey.

42:35.595 --> 42:38.348
What you doing?

42:38.431 --> 42:41.643
Nothing, just waiting
for a fucking phone call.

42:43.562 --> 42:45.689
So you threw Fiona out.

42:47.148 --> 42:48.483
Yeah.

42:48.567 --> 42:49.901
Okay.

42:49.985 --> 42:51.611
Well, she's gonna
stay with Kev and me

42:51.695 --> 42:53.238
until she gets
back on her feet.

42:53.321 --> 42:54.489
No, if she stays
with you and Kev,

42:54.573 --> 42:55.991
she won't get back
on her feet.

42:56.533 --> 42:57.784
I'm worried about her, Lip.

42:57.867 --> 42:59.244
Yeah, me too.

42:59.327 --> 43:00.996
Then let her back
in the damn house.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.915
She needs to hit rock bottom.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.042
Rock bottom?

43:06.126 --> 43:07.752
She's a strong person, Lip.

43:07.836 --> 43:09.462
I know you know that.

43:09.546 --> 43:12.007
But even the strongest people
fall down sometimes.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.301
You did. I have.
Kev has.

43:14.384 --> 43:16.261
We are here to lift
each other up.

43:19.055 --> 43:22.559
Okay. You heard
all this before, right?

43:22.642 --> 43:24.894
You gonna sit there and think
just because you're in AA,

43:24.978 --> 43:27.105
you have all the answers?

43:27.188 --> 43:28.773
Don't let Fiona
stay with you.

43:28.857 --> 43:30.900
Then what kind of friend
would I be?

43:32.527 --> 43:35.363
What kind of friend
do you wanna be?

43:35.447 --> 43:38.199
The kind that sees her drunk
at The Alibi every morning?

43:38.283 --> 43:41.036
The kind that-that
watches her lose her job

43:41.119 --> 43:42.662
or lose her
apartment building?

43:42.746 --> 43:45.624
Watches her wreck her car
and go to jail?

43:45.707 --> 43:46.916
You know what?
Then go ahead.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.752
All right, buy her
a case of vodka.

43:48.835 --> 43:51.379
Grab a shovel
and help her dig that grave,

43:51.463 --> 43:53.214
'cause that's not a friend.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.508
All right, that's-that's
a fuckin' bystander.

43:55.592 --> 43:57.802
- Lip, I have to--
- V!

43:58.928 --> 44:01.598
If you really love her

44:01.681 --> 44:04.768
and you really are her friend,

44:04.851 --> 44:06.853
you won't let her
stay with you.

44:09.606 --> 44:11.441
South Side
is where it's at!

44:11.524 --> 44:13.610
Gonna fuck you up
with a baseball bat!

44:13.693 --> 44:15.320
South Side
is where it's at!

44:15.403 --> 44:17.572
Gonna fuck you up
with a baseball bat!

44:17.656 --> 44:19.324
South Side
is where it's at!

44:19.407 --> 44:21.534
Gonna fuck you up
with a baseball bat!

44:21.618 --> 44:23.244
South Side
is where it's at!

44:23.328 --> 44:25.914
Gonna fuck you up
with a baseball bat!

44:30.335 --> 44:31.753
- Yo.
- Check it out.

44:31.836 --> 44:32.837
- Yeah.
- The power's back.

44:32.921 --> 44:34.130
Yeah.

44:34.214 --> 44:35.840
Oh, yeah.
Power, baby.

44:35.924 --> 44:38.259
- About time.
- Yeah.

44:38.343 --> 44:40.929
I don't know about you all,
but I could use a drink.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.847
Back to The Alibi?

44:42.931 --> 44:44.224
Thank God.
I'm gonna pass out.

44:44.307 --> 44:45.558
- You said it.
- Here we go.

44:45.642 --> 44:47.060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

44:47.143 --> 44:48.603
You're just gonna
go back to The Alibi?

44:48.687 --> 44:50.480
We were still the last ones
to get power.

44:50.563 --> 44:51.648
That's bullshit.

44:51.731 --> 44:53.817
Come on, the city's
laughing at us.

44:53.900 --> 44:56.653
Let's go tell 'em you don't
fuck with the South Side.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.154
Let's go.
Come on.

44:58.238 --> 45:00.865
It's only a few more blocks
to the North Side.

45:00.949 --> 45:03.368
See you at The Alibi.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.954
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

45:07.080 --> 45:08.832
God.

45:16.381 --> 45:18.550
Hey, baby.

45:18.633 --> 45:19.634
That was like
a long hike.

45:19.718 --> 45:21.302
Hi. South Side pride.

45:32.897 --> 45:34.274
You know what I want.

45:34.357 --> 45:35.984
V, I need a drink.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.611
- Okay, what?
- Vodka.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.579
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:47.662 --> 45:50.081
can I have
your attention, please?

45:50.165 --> 45:52.417
Today was a good fuckin' day.

45:52.500 --> 45:53.626
- It was a good day.
- Yeah.

45:53.710 --> 45:55.503
Yes, it was hot,

45:55.587 --> 45:57.297
yes, we had no electricity,

45:57.380 --> 45:59.257
and yes, I had
a very painful testicle

45:59.340 --> 46:00.925
that was the size
of a volleyball.

46:01.009 --> 46:02.469
- Whoo!
- Hear, hear.

46:02.552 --> 46:06.514
But today we found the
true power of the South Side.

46:06.598 --> 46:08.057
- Hear, hear.
- Yeah.

46:08.141 --> 46:11.436
No work.
Get drunk. Have fun.

46:11.519 --> 46:13.480
Now you know
what it's like to be me.

46:14.647 --> 46:16.191
Here's to
the greatest day ever.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.400
The South Side!

46:17.484 --> 46:20.069
The South Side!

46:20.153 --> 46:24.073
Fuck you,
you fuckin' pussies!

46:24.157 --> 46:26.576
You fuckin' never stop talking

46:26.659 --> 46:28.912
about how tough
the South Side is,

46:28.995 --> 46:30.330
how we survive.

46:30.413 --> 46:31.873
Ha!

46:31.956 --> 46:34.125
How you don't fuck
with the South Side.

46:34.209 --> 46:39.130
And then you
fucking do nothing!

46:39.214 --> 46:40.799
God.

46:40.882 --> 46:44.302
I am fuckin' embarrassed.

46:44.385 --> 46:46.387
You know, we talk a big game,

46:46.471 --> 46:50.308
but we don't actually do shit.

46:50.391 --> 46:53.686
We get exactly
what we deserve.

46:55.063 --> 46:56.856
So fuck you.
Fuck all of you.

46:56.940 --> 46:58.149
Take it easy, sweetheart.

46:58.233 --> 47:00.777
Sounds like somebody needs to
get fucked on the South Side.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.320
Fuck you,
you fuckin' cunt!

47:02.403 --> 47:04.948
- Whoa, yeah.
- Hey!

47:05.031 --> 47:08.660
All right, okay, somebody's
a little bit fired up.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.037
You okay?

47:11.120 --> 47:13.164
Fucking tired
of that bullshit.

47:13.248 --> 47:15.458
I get it. I know.

47:15.542 --> 47:16.543
I get it.

47:16.626 --> 47:19.671
Hey, I get it.

47:23.800 --> 47:28.721
So I, um...
I was talking to Kev,

47:28.805 --> 47:30.223
and with the girls
and everything,

47:30.306 --> 47:32.016
it's just a little
too much right now

47:32.100 --> 47:34.853
having you stay with us.

47:34.936 --> 47:37.355
I'm-I'm really sorry.

47:37.438 --> 47:38.773
I am.

47:38.857 --> 47:41.150
V...

47:41.234 --> 47:43.027
it's not a big deal.

47:43.111 --> 47:44.445
Really? You know, no.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.197
- I'm gonna talk--
- Seriously, yeah.

47:46.281 --> 47:48.324
It's okay.
I totally get it.

47:48.408 --> 47:49.659
I understand.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.997
All right.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.041
I'm sorry.

47:57.125 --> 47:59.919
Mm-hmm.

48:34.954 --> 48:37.624
I gotta get this one
into the bathtub. Pee-yew!

48:37.707 --> 48:38.958
Okay, I'll text you later.

48:39.042 --> 48:40.710
Cool.

48:42.503 --> 48:44.380
Hey, you want a beer?

48:44.464 --> 48:46.966
No, thanks.

48:47.050 --> 48:48.885
Are you fucking my sister?

48:50.094 --> 48:51.512
You're insane.

48:51.596 --> 48:52.931
Am I?

48:53.014 --> 48:55.099
Carl, Debbie and I
are friends.

48:55.183 --> 48:56.726
You're overthinking it.

48:56.809 --> 48:58.895
Overthinking what?
What am I overthinking?

49:01.105 --> 49:02.148
I think
we should break up.

49:02.231 --> 49:03.650
Why, 'cause you
love my sister?

49:03.733 --> 49:05.485
No, because
you're too clingy.

49:05.568 --> 49:07.487
Oh, come on,
Debbie's clingier than I am.

49:07.570 --> 49:09.072
Oh, my God!

49:09.155 --> 49:10.865
That's it, I am leaving.

49:10.949 --> 49:14.577
You know, I like you, Carl,
but seriously, what the fuck?

49:15.662 --> 49:16.663
Oh, come on.

49:16.746 --> 49:19.540
Call me
when you're not so needy.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.376
All right, see ya.

49:30.510 --> 49:32.178
That's what I thought.

49:36.474 --> 49:37.850
Oh.

49:37.934 --> 49:39.310
What-what do you mean, "oh"?

49:39.394 --> 49:40.561
Shut up.

49:40.645 --> 49:41.771
Lip!

49:47.318 --> 49:48.653
Hey.

49:48.736 --> 49:50.071
Uh, did Xan call?

49:50.154 --> 49:51.531
Yeah.

49:51.614 --> 49:53.408
Yeah,
a little while ago.

49:54.617 --> 49:56.744
- Where you going?
- I feel like breaking shit.

50:01.791 --> 50:03.501
So Xan's okay.

50:03.584 --> 50:06.087
- Yeah.
- Good.

50:06.170 --> 50:09.048
Here's the deal: the last thing
I need in my life

50:09.132 --> 50:10.550
is a man
telling me what to do.

50:10.633 --> 50:12.552
I really don't give a shit
about what you think,

50:12.635 --> 50:14.012
but I do understand

50:14.095 --> 50:16.431
that you might have
some feelings about this.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.808
But I want to be clear:
you do not get a vote.

50:19.642 --> 50:21.436
I don't get <i>a</i> vote,

50:21.519 --> 50:23.396
like, not even one?

50:24.814 --> 50:26.524
One.

50:26.607 --> 50:28.735
Out of 100.
I get the other 99.

50:32.113 --> 50:33.573
What if we're not meant
to be together?

50:33.656 --> 50:35.074
Then we break up.

50:35.158 --> 50:38.161
What if the baby has, like,
Down syndrome or something?

50:38.244 --> 50:39.912
I'll help you
take care of it.

50:39.996 --> 50:41.873
I'm gonna die
at a young age, so...

50:41.956 --> 50:42.999
I'll still be here.

50:43.082 --> 50:44.167
Yeah, well, what if you
get hit by a bus?

50:44.250 --> 50:46.085
All right, look,
maybe I will.

50:46.169 --> 50:47.712
All right, we don't know
what's gonna happen,

50:47.795 --> 50:50.089
but if you decide
to have this baby,

50:50.173 --> 50:52.133
I want to make damn sure
it has a father.

50:54.218 --> 50:56.220
Okay.

50:56.304 --> 50:58.765
I hear you.

50:58.848 --> 50:59.849
Okay.

51:02.935 --> 51:05.980
Should we, like,
get one of those books,

51:06.064 --> 51:09.317
<i>What to Expect When You're
Pregnant</i> or whatever?

51:10.234 --> 51:11.778
Not if you're not
gonna be pregnant.

51:11.861 --> 51:13.571
Are you gonna be pregnant?

51:13.654 --> 51:15.364
I have no idea.

51:15.448 --> 51:17.450
What would I even name it?

51:17.533 --> 51:19.160
I don't know,
we talking a boy or a girl?

51:19.243 --> 51:22.413
I don't know, like...
pretend it's a boy.

51:23.498 --> 51:24.499
Hambone.

51:24.582 --> 51:27.126
What? No.

51:29.545 --> 51:30.880
Bird?

51:30.963 --> 51:33.174
Who the hell
names their kid Bird?

51:33.257 --> 51:35.343
Charlie Parker's parents.

51:35.426 --> 51:36.844
No, that was a nickname.

51:36.928 --> 51:39.222
It was 'cause
he liked chicken.

51:39.305 --> 51:42.183
Oh, didn't know that.

51:42.266 --> 51:43.476
Uh, Wilmoth?

51:43.559 --> 51:44.602
Jesus.

51:44.685 --> 51:46.104
What?

51:46.187 --> 51:48.189
These are the worst names
I ever heard.

51:48.272 --> 51:49.524
I take it back.

51:49.607 --> 51:51.984
I will not be there
for our child, all right?

51:52.068 --> 51:54.612
Okay, can we just not
talk about it anymore?

51:54.695 --> 51:56.614
Can we, like,
pretend it's not happening

51:56.697 --> 51:59.617
and maybe it'll just...
go away?

52:01.244 --> 52:02.245
Yeah, all right.

52:02.328 --> 52:03.371
All right,
I'm fucking starving.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.039
I need food.

52:05.123 --> 52:08.376
Yeah, you, uh...
you like popcorn shrimp?

52:37.697 --> 52:39.699
Ugh.

54:46.867 --> 54:51.580
It was only about
two blocks from my house.

54:51.664 --> 54:55.876
I was woken up by the sound,
a crashing sound.

54:57.586 --> 54:59.463
And I could hear
myself screaming.

55:03.175 --> 55:06.512
I had crashed my car
into the back of a moving van.

55:08.848 --> 55:10.933
There was glass everywhere.

55:11.017 --> 55:13.853
Airbag deployed.
My nose was bleeding.

55:16.355 --> 55:19.150
I didn't feel any pain
till much later,

55:19.233 --> 55:22.028
but I didn't care about myself.

55:24.113 --> 55:26.741
I just kept thinking...

55:27.992 --> 55:30.161
I could have killed someone.

55:31.746 --> 55:35.374
This is...really hard
for me to talk about.

56:02.234 --> 56:03.527
Whose porn is this?

56:03.611 --> 56:05.446
It's mine.
Giving it to KJ now.

56:05.529 --> 56:07.490
Oh, why you getting rid
of your porn, tater tot?

56:07.573 --> 56:09.033
Just the
girl-on-girl stuff.

56:09.116 --> 56:10.284
Kinda makes me sad.

56:10.368 --> 56:12.078
Yeah.

56:12.161 --> 56:13.496
Seen it.

56:13.579 --> 56:14.830
Seen it.

56:14.914 --> 56:16.665
In it.
