WEBVTT

00:03.471 --> 00:06.574
Hey, honey, which one?

00:06.674 --> 00:07.575
The blue.

00:07.675 --> 00:08.976
But say I'm in Southeast Asia

00:09.077 --> 00:11.479
negotiating for top-of-the-line
sewing equipment.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.981
The blue.
Okay, but what if I'm...?

00:14.082 --> 00:15.683
The blue.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.219
You know what?
I'll bring both.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.089
You can't wear black when
you're making deals in Malaysia.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.290
They consider it unlucky.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.525
Good to know.
I was wearing

00:24.625 --> 00:26.460
a little black number
the night I lost

00:26.560 --> 00:29.497
20,000 ringgits playing pai gow.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.799
You can't gamble
in Kuala Lumpur.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.102
Oh, honey, you can gamble anywhere.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.604
Just follow the Chinese people.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.572
Did you travel to Malaysia

00:38.672 --> 00:40.208
a lot when you ran MaxDot?

00:40.308 --> 00:44.478
Max and I went to Malaysia,
Korea, the Philippines...

00:44.578 --> 00:46.980
Really, anywhere
they eat with sticks.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.982
I'd watch Douglas
and Christina for a week,

00:49.083 --> 00:50.484
and they'd travel the world.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.320
Yeah, but we always
brought you back a T-shirt.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.455
Yeah, that made up for it.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.057
The '80s were my time.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.893
There was J.R. Ewing...

00:59.993 --> 01:01.895
and Dottie Wheeler.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.098
I would have loved
to see you back then.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.834
I was what the youngsters
would call a bad bitch.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.402
Now...

01:08.502 --> 01:11.605
you can see me travel
all the way to my room.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.674
Bring me back a shirt.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.744
You should take
her with you.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.747
Why do you want to hurt me?
I'm nice to you.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.316
She has recovered enough
from her stroke.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.517
She would enjoy it.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.785
But I'd be miserable.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.587
But <i>she</i> would enjoy it.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.757
Yeah, repeating it doesn't
make me want to do it more.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.559
I see this every day at work.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.093
People think
they have enough time,

01:33.194 --> 01:34.562
then something happens

01:34.662 --> 01:36.330
and they don't get the chance
to say goodbye.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.699
Thank God for FaceTime, huh?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.337
Mom! You want to go
to Malaysia with me?

01:43.437 --> 01:45.406
No, thank you. Hmm.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.308
Go and convince her.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.410
Ah, come on.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.808
Ah, <i>e kaale,</i> Mummy. <i>Kaale.</i>

02:20.908 --> 02:22.510
What is all this?
I was hoping

02:22.610 --> 02:23.944
we could spend
some time together,

02:24.044 --> 02:25.346
just the two of us.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.381
I see.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.283
Why?

02:30.618 --> 02:31.719
You are my mother.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.254
Tell me what you have done,

02:33.354 --> 02:36.657
and I will decide if I want
to remain your mother.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.259
Could you please just sit?

02:38.359 --> 02:41.362
I have KitKat Chunkies.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.164
You are bribing me
with confectionary.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.070
Auntie Olu and I would have
girls' nights like this

02:50.170 --> 02:52.540
when I first moved
to America.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.041
I was worried about you,

02:54.141 --> 02:57.378
but I was glad you at least had
a second-rate version of me.

02:58.812 --> 02:59.980
We would drink wine

03:00.080 --> 03:01.449
and put on
<i>Big Brother Nigeria.</i>

03:01.549 --> 03:05.018
So, you would get drunk
and watch terrible television?

03:05.118 --> 03:06.620
The show did not matter.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.457
It was about the laughter
and wonderful conversation.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.625
That sounds nice.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.261
Yes.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.296
Cheers.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.368
Mmm.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.144
So...

03:32.346 --> 03:34.548
What is new with you?

03:34.648 --> 03:37.685
Bob is in Malaysia
on business.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.388
I know that. Ah.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.026
Work has been very busy.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.662
I know that. Ah.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.036
How are things
in your life?

03:56.136 --> 03:58.339
None of your business.
Of course.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.254
There's no smoking.

04:14.355 --> 04:18.225
Aw! What's the third
world coming to?

04:19.159 --> 04:21.329
I think most of the
manufacturing machines are

04:21.429 --> 04:23.096
in the grand ballroom.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.231
Oh...

04:24.332 --> 04:25.733
Busi's got a prototype here.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.668
Clear your schedule.
We found our white whale.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.370
Eh, sorry I'm gonna
have to miss that,

04:29.470 --> 04:31.505
I'll be too busy networking.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.906
You mean you'll be
at the bar.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.942
That's what I just said.

04:35.042 --> 04:35.943
Bob?

04:36.043 --> 04:38.011
Wati, hey!

04:38.111 --> 04:39.947
I thought it was you.

04:40.047 --> 04:43.016
I recognized your flat head.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.252
And hubba hubba.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.855
Who is this young lady?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.323
Wati, the last time I saw you,

04:49.423 --> 04:50.958
we were both in the back seat
of a squad car.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.161
I told you not to give tequila
to that policeman's horse.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.299
Do not tell me
you are staying here. Well...

04:59.400 --> 05:01.569
this is where we keep our bags,
but you know me.

05:01.669 --> 05:05.038
A disco nap,
and then I hit the streets.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.807
You must stay with me.

05:06.907 --> 05:11.011
Oh, me and my flat head
wouldn't want to impose.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.813
My wife would
not forgive me.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.515
I insist.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.484
We'd love to.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.652
Great, I will
see you at home.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.720
Can't wait.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.222
Oh, you can't smoke
here anymore.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.595
What the hell, Mom?

05:27.695 --> 05:29.863
What?
We can't stay with Wati.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.298
Why not?
He's an old friend.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.666
He's also the guy
we're gonna screw over

05:32.766 --> 05:34.802
when we pull our business
in six months.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.470
Ah...
I forgot about that.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.473
Yeah, that is a pickle.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.475
I knew I should've
come alone.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.612
Then this is on you.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.654
We are going now. Have fun.

05:53.754 --> 05:54.822
I would love to,

05:54.922 --> 05:56.323
but I have
a whole list of things

05:56.424 --> 05:57.925
to take care of around here.

05:58.025 --> 06:01.261
I know you are going to
drink soda and watch YouTube.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.597
That is on the list.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.501
<i>E karo,</i> Auntie. Ah.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.669
Morenike.
<i>E karo.</i>

06:08.769 --> 06:10.203
Hello.
Uncle.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.606
Is now a bad time?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.908
Oh, Morenike and I were
just going out.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.410
Oh.
To brunch.

06:16.510 --> 06:19.346
Oh.
You and I used to do that.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.914
Yes, we did.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.216
And now you have been replaced.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.619
No one has been replaced.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.288
Come by tomorrow.
We will do something then.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.957
Auntie, tomorrow
we have reservations

06:30.057 --> 06:31.124
for the escape room.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.794
Oh, yes.
Well, I will call you.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.763
Or I could join you.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.036
You do not want me to.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.872
Of course we do.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.976
Well, then...

06:49.076 --> 06:50.478
I will come.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.346
Okay.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.549
You will come.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.854
I am feeling awkward,

07:00.954 --> 07:04.224
and I am not even
in this conversation.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.968
Anything for my most
loyal customer.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.269
You have done so much

07:16.369 --> 07:17.838
for our family.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.847
I brought a friend of yours
with me from the States.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.751
Hello, Jack,
it has been too long.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.420
You did not have
to bring anything.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.389
Your ongoing business
is the greatest gift.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.492
Okay, enough shoptalk.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.529
Jin, this nasi lemak
is incredible.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.463
I'm glad you like it.

07:43.564 --> 07:48.235
MaxDot is the way
we keep food on our table.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.270
Uh-huh.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.472
You mind if I crack open
your buddy there?

07:53.607 --> 07:56.977
So, um, how are the kids?

07:57.077 --> 07:58.411
Where's little Selly?

07:58.512 --> 08:02.049
All grown up.
She just went off to college.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.917
University of Wisconsin.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.085
Oh, that's great.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.687
I'm paying $40,000

08:06.787 --> 08:08.656
for her to drink
Miller Lite.

08:08.756 --> 08:12.560
Which we would never be able
to afford without...

08:12.660 --> 08:14.828
Yeah, you're welcome!

08:19.733 --> 08:21.468
I'm going to get
a peach Bellini.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.703
Careful, Auntie.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.271
Remember what happened
last time.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.474
What happened last time?

08:27.575 --> 08:30.711
I drank it too fast
and I got the hiccups.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.581
You know, sometimes it helps
if you drink water.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.650
She did.
It made them even worse.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.754
I-I had the hiccups the other
day. It was also funny.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.255
Oh, really?
What happened?

08:42.355 --> 08:46.159
Eventually they went away.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.900
What's happening?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.635
Just watch.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.407
â™ª At first I was afraid â™ª

09:00.507 --> 09:02.075
â™ª I was petrified â™ª

09:02.175 --> 09:04.311
â™ª Kept thinking
I could never live â™ª

09:04.411 --> 09:06.179
â™ª Without you by my side â™ª

09:06.279 --> 09:08.281
â™ª But then I spent
so many nights... â™ª

09:08.381 --> 09:11.752
Um, what kind of
restaurant is this?

09:11.852 --> 09:14.622
Oh, perhaps we should
have warned you.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.824
â™ª And so you're back â™ª

09:16.924 --> 09:19.827
Oh.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.630
Oh.

09:22.730 --> 09:25.165
â™ª Did you think I'd crumble? â™ª

09:25.265 --> 09:27.134
â™ª Did you think
I'd lay down and die? â™ª

09:27.234 --> 09:29.536
Oh...
â™ª Oh, no, not I â™ª

09:29.637 --> 09:31.004
â™ª I will survive â™ª

09:31.104 --> 09:33.607
â™ª Oh, as long as I know
how to love â™ª

09:33.707 --> 09:35.408
â™ª I know I'll stay alive â™ª

09:35.508 --> 09:36.810
â™ª I've got all my life to live â™ª

09:36.910 --> 09:39.613
â™ª And I've got
all my love to give â™ª

09:39.713 --> 09:41.281
â™ª And I'll survive â™ª

09:41.381 --> 09:43.416
â™ª I will survive â™ª

09:44.251 --> 09:45.686
â™ª Hey, hey. â™ª

09:54.094 --> 09:55.528
Look, Dottie.

09:55.629 --> 09:59.532
This was when we got
our ears pierced together.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.434
Oh, I think she's out.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.772
But you look great.
I like the dangly yin-yang.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.809
You are a good son
for bringing her.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.979
Yeah, she's almost pleasant
when she's sleeping.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.951
When she put you in charge
of MaxDot, I had my doubts.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.152
I remember.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.688
"Your son's a dumbass"
is the first phrase

10:20.788 --> 10:22.923
I learned in Mandarin.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.427
I have to start thinking of who
I want to leave my company to.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.596
You thinking
of calling it quits?

10:29.697 --> 10:32.132
I'm losing my fire.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.901
I used to love socks.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.536
Now I just really
like them.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.809
Well, then there's something
we should talk about.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.347
MaxDot's gonna be
making some changes.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.482
What kind of changes?

10:49.582 --> 10:51.018
Well, as you know,

10:51.118 --> 10:53.653
a lot of American companies
make their products overseas.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.857
I thank God every day
for such laziness.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.028
We're not gonna be one
of those companies anymore.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.529
What?

11:03.563 --> 11:05.532
We're setting up
our own factory.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.269
Look, this is good,
you just said

11:09.369 --> 11:10.537
you wanted to get out.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.573
I meant decades from now.
I'm only 80!

11:13.673 --> 11:15.242
Well, now you're
still young enough

11:15.342 --> 11:16.609
to enjoy time
with your wife.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.747
Vacation together.
With what money?

11:20.613 --> 11:21.949
Yeah, that is a pickle.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.785
Get out of my house!
Come on, don't be that way.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.154
Get out!
What's going on?

11:30.123 --> 11:31.859
There it is.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.202
My goodness,
you killed it again.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.603
Yes,

11:43.703 --> 11:45.038
you slayed, bitch.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.440
Auntie!

11:47.540 --> 11:49.176
What?
That is how we speak.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.378
All of us queens.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.613
Once my friends met Auntie,

11:53.713 --> 11:55.082
they could not get
enough of her.

11:55.182 --> 11:59.052
And are all your
friends... like this?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.588
Ah. We have a virgin?

12:01.688 --> 12:03.123
Ring the bell.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.258
Please, no bell, all right?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.160
Please, no pictures.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.030
This is illegal where I'm from.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.866
We are not in Nigeria.
Have fun.

12:12.966 --> 12:16.403
Stick this into her bra,
you will feel better.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.176
It is okay.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.345
Are you singing today?

12:25.445 --> 12:28.715
If I keep on drinking,
anything is possible.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.485
Auntie Olu, you crack me up.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.857
So, you both knew this
was going to happen?

12:36.957 --> 12:39.226
Yes,
it is a drag brunch.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.627
Many of the queens
will perform today.

12:40.727 --> 12:43.296
There's Harlot Letter.
Peg the Stallion.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.698
And there is my favorite,

12:45.799 --> 12:47.300
Tuckin' Carlson.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.105
<i>Oluwa mi o.</i>

12:52.205 --> 12:55.008
Oh.
<i>Olu-wa mi o.</i>

12:55.508 --> 12:57.010
That could be my drag name.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.014
You know what time it is.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.716
Twerk o'clock!

13:03.817 --> 13:05.618
Come on, Auntie.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.687
If you want a free shot,
you better get up

13:07.787 --> 13:10.023
and shake it!
Ooh, no.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.825
I could not possibly.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.327
â™ª That can coach me... â™ª

13:14.427 --> 13:17.230
Go, Auntie! Go, Auntie!

13:17.330 --> 13:18.398
Go, Auntie!

13:18.498 --> 13:21.334
Go, Auntie! Go, Auntie!

13:21.434 --> 13:23.470
Go, Auntie! Go, Auntie!

13:26.339 --> 13:29.009
Wati's been our friend
for 30 years,

13:29.109 --> 13:30.777
and we stabbed him
in the back.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.546
No, I wanted to
stab him in the back,

13:33.646 --> 13:35.582
you stuck the knife
right in his sweet face.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.750
Hey, you think
the kitchen's still open?

13:38.952 --> 13:41.288
How can you be so cold?

13:41.388 --> 13:42.755
It's business.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.424
Our arrangement with Wati
served its purpose,

13:44.524 --> 13:45.893
and now it's done.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.028
You didn't cry when
we fired your math tutor.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.363
We didn't have
a relationship with him.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.832
Oh, God!

13:53.766 --> 13:56.003
You wanted to bring
manufacturing back to Detroit.

13:56.103 --> 13:59.139
Where did you think
you were bringing it from?

13:59.239 --> 14:00.607
Well, it was easier
to screw him over

14:00.707 --> 14:03.576
before I knew he had two
Pomeranians named Max and Dot.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.546
You may not have
the stomach for this, Bobby.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.016
I have been running
the company for 25 years.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.051
After it was
already built.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.752
The dirty work was done.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.822
The eggs were cracked.
The bodies were buried.
I get it!

14:17.224 --> 14:18.458
I'm sorry,
but I just think

14:18.558 --> 14:20.327
there's a way to run
a successful company

14:20.427 --> 14:23.130
and treat people with
honesty and respect.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.664
That's nice.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.866
Totally delusional
but nice.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.141
I thought you couldn't get
into one of those places

14:34.241 --> 14:35.275
unless you are gay.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.544
Apparently,
everyone is welcome.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.047
Oh, who'd have thought
that anyone can get lunch

14:40.147 --> 14:42.549
in a place
that serves lunch?

14:42.649 --> 14:46.353
Auntie seemed so... comfortable.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.888
There's an easy
explanation for that.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.993
Her aunt isn't gay.
I've been to a drag show.

14:53.093 --> 14:56.096
And there's an easy
explanation for that.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.466
If anyone was
uncomfortable, it was me.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.134
I must be a bad person.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.804
No, baby, you were just raised
in a certain environment,

15:04.904 --> 15:07.907
and it can take a long time
to put that stuff down. Yes.

15:08.008 --> 15:11.444
Not everyone is as
open-minded as I am.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.314
You were just over here
basing people's sexuality

15:14.414 --> 15:16.316
on where they eat waffles.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.252
But I don't
hate them for it.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.421
Mind open.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.290
I do not hate them either.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.891
I know you don't, sweetie.

15:24.992 --> 15:29.096
On a homophobia scale,
I'd put you at a... seven.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.397
Seven?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.065
Hey, I'm giving you credit.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.802
Seven is not bad when you were
raised in a church full of tens.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.137
Keep working on it,

15:37.237 --> 15:40.107
and soon you'll be down
to a zero like me.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.175
And your bisexual auntie.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.789
Hello, handsome.

16:00.793 --> 16:05.098
My Mandarin's a little rusty,
but I gather you're pissed.

16:05.198 --> 16:09.202
Bob is a selfish man
with a stupid mustache.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.570
You want to keep whining,

16:10.670 --> 16:12.972
or you want to kill
that bottle of Jack?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.974
I can do both.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.944
Are you still a lightweight?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.112
I only brought two outfits

16:19.212 --> 16:21.381
and I don't need you
puking on me.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.184
If I throw up, it will
not be the alcohol--

16:24.284 --> 16:26.286
it will be because
of your face.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.289
Hey, jackass,
I had a stroke.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.158
Is that over yet?

16:31.258 --> 16:33.260
I missed this.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.428
Me, too.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.633
You know, our factory's
not up and running yet.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.202
You can still
keep making socks

16:42.302 --> 16:43.736
while you figure out
your next move.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.872
I would rather
keep my pride.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.108
I've seen you blacked out
in a jail cell.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.976
What do you know
about pride?

16:50.910 --> 16:53.846
The way I see it, you've only
got one way out of this.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.716
I am not managing
my brother's KFC.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.187
How about
you come to America

17:00.287 --> 17:02.722
and help us run
MaxDot manufacturing?

17:02.822 --> 17:04.857
Why would I do anything
to help you?

17:04.957 --> 17:08.095
You get a gig, you get to be
close to your daughter,

17:08.195 --> 17:10.930
and you can buy Jack Daniel's
at every gas station.

17:11.030 --> 17:11.998
Is that true?

17:12.099 --> 17:13.733
It's right next
to the cigarettes.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.369
My God,
that sounds wonderful.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.005
So, do we have a deal?

17:19.106 --> 17:22.142
We have a deal.
Thank you, Dottie.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.211
You're welcome.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.682
Call me old-fashioned,

17:29.782 --> 17:31.918
but I think there's a way
to succeed in business

17:32.018 --> 17:34.554
while treating people
with honesty and respect.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.390
That's nonsense.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.159
Yeah, it is.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.234
Hey.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.502
Hey, you.
How is the trip?

17:49.602 --> 17:50.770
Oh, it's going great.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.540
Thank you so much
for making me bring Mom.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.607
You're welcome.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.443
I was being sarcastic.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.479
I know, so was I.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.847
There he is.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.715
Hang on,
the curse has returned.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.617
You were right, Bobby.

18:04.717 --> 18:05.918
What are you talking about?

18:06.018 --> 18:07.620
Friendship, respect,
all that crap.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.357
That's why Wati's coming
to Detroit to work with us.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.425
What?!
I-I have to go.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.494
Me, too.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.963
I need to talk
to this drag queen.

18:17.063 --> 18:17.964
What?

18:18.064 --> 18:19.132
Excuse me.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.136
Twerk o'clock?

18:23.236 --> 18:25.938
Ah, you are Morenike's cousin.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.707
Yes. Abishola.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.742
I have never seen you
on this bus.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.978
I am a little late
for school today.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.581
You are in law school?

18:34.681 --> 18:36.749
You cannot tell by
these bags under my eyes?

18:36.849 --> 18:38.050
Last time I saw them,

18:38.151 --> 18:40.487
they were covered
in glitter.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.156
Would you like to sit?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.960
Thank you. Yeah.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.466
So, what did you think
of the performance?

18:53.566 --> 18:56.836
Uh, it was very...

18:56.936 --> 18:59.105
colorful.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.573
You are so polite.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.775
I know you were uncomfortable,

19:02.875 --> 19:04.477
but you stayed
the whole time.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.045
I did.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.917
Morenike is lucky to
have family like you.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.652
Thank you.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.990
I'm down to a six.

19:25.031 --> 19:28.435
Here is the boring logo
we have been using for decades.

19:28.535 --> 19:32.539
And here is the MaxDot logo
of the future.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.743
I just see a Max with a period.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.645
Max. Dot.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.581
MaxDot.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.816
Oh, now I get it.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.853
I still don't like it,
but I get it.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.522
What the hell is that?

19:49.622 --> 19:52.492
We're kicking around
ideas for a new logo.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.563
So, you replaced my name
with a freaking blob?

19:56.663 --> 20:00.367
It is not a blob.
It is a dot.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.869
Thank God
we're bringing in a pro.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.070
What are you talking about?

20:04.170 --> 20:05.838
You didn't tell 'em yet?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.574
I figured you'd want to.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.143
Wati's coming in
to run the factory.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.445
What?
What?
Excuse me?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.881
Why was I not involved
in this decision?

20:14.981 --> 20:17.116
Many of us were not involved.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.986
Does this change the hierarchy?
Am I still number two?

20:20.086 --> 20:22.289
Am I still the janitor?

20:22.389 --> 20:25.292
You know, this would be
a wonderful discussion

20:25.392 --> 20:26.859
if this was a democracy.

20:26.959 --> 20:30.897
But you are living in
the People's Republic of Dottie.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.300
Meeting's over.
Back to work.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.235
Long live Dottie!

20:38.505 --> 20:39.839
What happened in Malaysia?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.109
I woke up a monster.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.013
Am I still the janitor?
