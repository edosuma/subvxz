(screaming)

00:02.545 --> 00:06.256
(upbeat party music)

00:06.257 --> 00:08.426
(cheering)

00:33.827 --> 00:36.787
♫ If you can't see

00:36.788 --> 00:39.749
♫ If you can't hide

00:40.667 --> 00:43.085
♫ That something's closer

00:43.086 --> 00:47.756
♫ And it's standing right outside

00:47.757 --> 00:51.093
♫ Look out, look out

00:51.094 --> 00:54.638
♫ It will grab hold of you

00:54.639 --> 00:58.017
♫ All alone in the dark

00:58.018 --> 01:02.105
♫ Where there's nothing you can do

01:17.662 --> 01:21.206
♫ Got real sharp teeth

01:21.207 --> 01:24.335
♫ Got eyes that shine

01:25.336 --> 01:28.505
♫ If you can't get away tonight

01:28.506 --> 01:32.176
♫ You won't come back alive

01:32.177 --> 01:35.220
♫ Look out, look out

01:35.221 --> 01:38.932
♫ It will grab hold of you

01:38.933 --> 01:42.478
♫ All alone in the dark

01:42.479 --> 01:46.608
♫ Where there's nothing you can do

01:48.068 --> 01:50.236
(cheering)

02:21.976 --> 02:23.519
- Hi.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.480
I'm Peter Bennett, president
of Alpha Sigma Rho.

02:26.481 --> 02:28.607
Are you one of our sorority sisters?

02:28.608 --> 02:29.775
- Who do you think I am,

02:29.776 --> 02:31.151
your fairy godmother?

02:31.152 --> 02:31.985
- No.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.655
But you're certainly everything
I could've wished for.

02:34.656 --> 02:36.532
- Peter, everything's all set up.

02:36.533 --> 02:37.950
- Wonderful, Scott.

02:37.951 --> 02:39.910
- You're in your big brother fraternity,

02:39.911 --> 02:42.121
don't you think you ought
to show a little respect?

02:42.122 --> 02:44.665
- I'm showing more than respect, honey.

02:44.666 --> 02:47.584
(giggling)

02:47.585 --> 02:49.169
- Listen, why don't you
and I go on upstairs

02:49.170 --> 02:50.796
and exchange phone numbers?

02:50.797 --> 02:51.797
Scott?

02:51.798 --> 02:53.424
Take over, will you?

02:55.260 --> 02:56.511
Hey, who's she?

02:58.638 --> 03:00.764
- Oh, that's one of the new pledges.

03:00.765 --> 03:02.350
They call her Marti.

03:07.397 --> 03:09.565
- So who is the Zorro
impersonator in the purple cape

03:09.566 --> 03:11.692
at the bar staring at me?

03:11.693 --> 03:15.613
- That's Peter Bennett, president
of the fraternity house.

03:15.822 --> 03:18.366
He lives all year for Hell Night.

03:18.575 --> 03:22.286
This is when he really
puts it to the pledges.

03:22.287 --> 03:24.121
- Can I resign now?

03:24.122 --> 03:25.581
- No, you don't.

03:25.582 --> 03:26.999
We got a deal.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.668
I've already given you the
best room in the house,

03:29.669 --> 03:32.629
not to mention the car and the clothes.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.756
You're not quitting now.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.467
Mingle, dear, mingle.

03:38.553 --> 03:41.305
♫ See the candle blow out

03:41.306 --> 03:45.225
♫ It's colder than before

03:45.226 --> 03:49.563
♫ Standing in the shadows

03:49.564 --> 03:51.357
- Thanks, little doll.

03:52.358 --> 03:53.526
Yes-siree Bob.

04:00.158 --> 04:02.327
- Look what just walked in.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.416
- Not my type.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.588
See that?

04:14.589 --> 04:16.798
(cheering)

04:19.093 --> 04:20.303
That's my type.

04:34.150 --> 04:35.400
- Hey Peter, isn't it about time

04:35.401 --> 04:37.152
you start the initiation?

04:37.153 --> 04:39.071
- Nah, it's still early.

04:39.072 --> 04:41.073
Look at Sicowski!

04:41.074 --> 04:43.450
He hasn't even barfed
on the trophy case yet.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.203
And the front windows still aren't broken.

04:46.204 --> 04:47.913
(glass shattering)

04:47.914 --> 04:50.124
(retching)

04:51.209 --> 04:53.001
Well, I guess it's time to
get this show on the road!

04:53.002 --> 04:54.712
- Alright!
- Let's go!

04:58.466 --> 05:00.885
(bugle music)

05:04.973 --> 05:07.141
(cheering)

05:08.643 --> 05:11.187
(cars honking)

05:43.344 --> 05:45.596
(murmuring)

05:52.020 --> 05:52.812
- Quiet!

05:57.150 --> 05:59.193
(oohing)

06:02.613 --> 06:05.199
(loud gunshot)

06:14.709 --> 06:16.877
(gate creaking)

06:16.878 --> 06:18.795
Welcome to Garth Manor.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.213
(oohing)

06:20.214 --> 06:22.383
(laughing)

06:37.065 --> 06:39.649
In order to be a member
of Alpha Sigma Rho,

06:39.650 --> 06:41.485
one has to do what?

06:41.486 --> 06:42.236
Mr. Reed?

06:43.154 --> 06:46.948
- To stay in Garth Manor
one night, Mr. President.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.076
- Very good, Jeff.

06:49.077 --> 06:51.453
And why is this night so special?

06:51.454 --> 06:52.829
Ms. Dunsmore?

06:52.830 --> 06:54.247
- Because 12 years ago,

06:54.248 --> 06:56.083
Raymond Garth murdered his family here

06:56.084 --> 06:57.751
and then committed suicide!

06:57.752 --> 06:59.044
- And is there something funny

06:59.045 --> 07:00.462
about a man murdering his family

07:00.463 --> 07:02.255
and then killing himself?

07:02.256 --> 07:04.758
- I'm just a little tipsy.

07:04.759 --> 07:05.926
- [Peter] I hope you
didn't bring any other

07:05.927 --> 07:07.594
intoxicants in here with you.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.929
- Oh, of course not!

07:08.930 --> 07:11.556
(giggling)

07:11.557 --> 07:13.266
- Well, just to make sure,

07:13.267 --> 07:16.478
I'll have to personally
search you before we leave.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.521
- It'd be a pleasure.

07:17.522 --> 07:20.190
(laughter)

07:20.191 --> 07:21.317
- Shall we go?

07:27.115 --> 07:29.491
In 1850, Virgil Garth built this mansion

07:29.492 --> 07:31.952
with the gold that was
pouring out of his mines.

07:31.953 --> 07:34.287
Since then, four generations
of Garths have lived here,

07:34.288 --> 07:36.373
until 12 years ago.

07:36.374 --> 07:37.874
The last people to live in the house

07:37.875 --> 07:40.669
were Raymond and Lillian
Garth, and their four children.

07:40.670 --> 07:43.171
Now, Lillian Garth was
a hopeless simpleton.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.590
About the only thing she was
good for was childbearing,

07:45.591 --> 07:48.260
and she didn't turn out
to be too hot at that.

07:48.261 --> 07:50.762
First child she bore Raymond was a boy.

07:50.763 --> 07:53.557
A mongoloid boy they called Morris.

07:53.558 --> 07:55.767
Now, Morris brought great
sorrow to the Garths,

07:55.768 --> 07:58.103
and they immediately set
about to have another child,

07:58.104 --> 08:01.898
and they were soon cursed
with a baby girl, Suzanne.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.900
Now, she was so hideously deformed,

08:03.901 --> 08:05.902
that it was impossible to
tell from looking at her

08:05.903 --> 08:08.572
if she was male or female!

08:08.573 --> 08:10.615
And to her father's immense disgust,

08:10.616 --> 08:12.742
she used to drag herself around the house

08:12.743 --> 08:15.496
with the help of her one good leg.

08:16.789 --> 08:18.039
(laughter)

08:18.040 --> 08:20.917
Now, the Garths were very
fanatical about their privacy.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.003
They didn't want to have to
be dependent on anyone else,

08:23.004 --> 08:25.338
so they isolated themselves up here.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.924
That is why they never put
in any modern utilities.

08:27.925 --> 08:32.011
There's no gas, no
electricity, and no phone.

08:32.013 --> 08:34.097
So, again, they tried to have a child,

08:34.097 --> 08:37.225
and within the year the
Garths added Margret.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.352
But unfortunately, it soon became apparent

08:39.352 --> 08:41.897
that poor little Margret
could neither hear,

08:41.898 --> 08:44.191
nor speak, nor see.

08:44.192 --> 08:46.234
But good old Ray was determined,

08:46.235 --> 08:48.320
and he decided to have one last go.

08:48.321 --> 08:50.906
So Lillian got pregnant again.

08:50.907 --> 08:53.617
She carried the child
for 10 and a half months,

08:53.618 --> 08:57.245
until finally she delivered
a little gork named Andrew.

08:57.246 --> 09:00.874
Andrew never spoke a word
in his first 14 years.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.959
He just made these grunts and groans,

09:02.960 --> 09:05.337
like the sounds of wild animals.

09:05.338 --> 09:07.464
Now, Raymond Garth lived
isolated in this house

09:07.465 --> 09:09.841
for 14 years with this freak show,

09:09.842 --> 09:11.885
until he couldn't stand it any more.

09:11.886 --> 09:15.764
12 years ago, he assembled the
entire family in the parlor,

09:15.765 --> 09:17.974
and then he took his dear wife, Lillian,

09:17.975 --> 09:19.726
and he strangled her to death.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.228
Then he took the mongoloid son Morris

09:21.229 --> 09:23.313
and he bashed out what
little brains he had

09:23.314 --> 09:25.482
with the fireplace poker.

09:25.483 --> 09:27.108
Then he took the deformed little Suzanne

09:27.109 --> 09:29.903
and he impaled her with the same poker.

09:29.904 --> 09:32.572
Then he took the deaf, dumb,
and blind little Margret,

09:32.573 --> 09:34.408
and he slit her throat.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.911
And then Raymond Garth got a rope

09:37.912 --> 09:39.871
and hung himself to death.

09:39.872 --> 09:41.081
(groaning)

09:41.082 --> 09:43.292
(laughter)

09:46.295 --> 09:48.463
Leaving the cruelest punishment of all

09:48.464 --> 09:51.383
to his 14 year old gorked-out son, Andrew,

09:51.384 --> 09:53.176
who was forced to witness the slaughter

09:53.177 --> 09:54.887
of his entire family.

09:58.057 --> 09:59.849
Now, when the police arrived,

09:59.850 --> 10:01.810
they discovered a note
written by Raymond Garth

10:01.811 --> 10:05.438
describing the entire gruesome act.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.606
But strangely,

10:06.607 --> 10:10.443
they only discovered three dead bodies.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.446
And young Andrew was nowhere to be found.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.366
Well, they search the house
as thoroughly as they could,

10:16.367 --> 10:19.829
but still only came up with three corpses.

10:21.414 --> 10:22.206
Andrew...

10:23.708 --> 10:26.626
Andrew is still believed by some

10:26.627 --> 10:30.213
to be living somewhere within this house.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.800
(ominous music)

10:54.864 --> 10:57.158
(loud bang)

10:58.451 --> 10:59.201
Come in!

11:14.342 --> 11:15.675
Now...

11:15.676 --> 11:18.720
You four may sleep anywhere
you want in the house.

11:18.721 --> 11:21.182
Either separately or otherwise.

11:22.725 --> 11:26.936
But remember, you may not leave
the confines of the estate.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.730
That shouldn't be too hard.

11:28.731 --> 11:33.360
You'll find the gate is virtually
impossible to climb over.

11:33.361 --> 11:34.445
Any questions?

11:37.740 --> 11:40.660
(thunder rumbling)

11:47.375 --> 11:49.543
(laughter)

11:50.961 --> 11:53.214
(cheering)

12:09.271 --> 12:11.064
Now, the only way out of Garth Manor

12:11.065 --> 12:13.067
is to shoot your way out.

12:15.069 --> 12:16.945
Don't use it unless you have to.

12:16.946 --> 12:20.532
And don't try climbing the fence.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.283
You might cut your nuts off.

12:22.284 --> 12:24.828
(laughter)

12:24.829 --> 12:26.539
See you four at dawn.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.167
Just about six hours.

12:31.168 --> 12:31.961
Have fun.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.047
(cheering)

12:51.105 --> 12:53.524
(rock music)

12:55.151 --> 12:57.653
(cars revving)

13:10.082 --> 13:12.792
- Wow, this place is pretty radical.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.502
- It is that.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.504
- You know, this would be
a hot place to go hunting.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.338
- Hunting?

13:17.339 --> 13:18.715
Ugh, I hate guns!

13:18.716 --> 13:21.050
- Yeah, but sometimes
they come in pretty handy.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.719
Like one summer I was camping out

13:22.720 --> 13:23.845
on the north shore of Oahu,

13:23.846 --> 13:25.138
and these locals used
to come by every night

13:25.139 --> 13:26.473
and beat the crap out of us, you know?

13:26.474 --> 13:28.850
So listen to this, one day, we go down,

13:28.851 --> 13:30.894
we buy ourselves a shotgun.

13:30.895 --> 13:31.936
Go down to the local bar,

13:31.937 --> 13:34.481
and really put the fear of God into them.

13:34.482 --> 13:37.567
Needless to say, we didn't have
too many hassles after that.

13:37.568 --> 13:38.777
- So you guys really believe this story

13:38.778 --> 13:42.405
about old Raymond Garth and
gorked-out Andrew and all that?

13:42.406 --> 13:44.407
- No, Peter's full of shit.

13:44.408 --> 13:46.951
- Actually, I think there's
some truth to that story.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.787
That guy Garth did kill his family here.

13:48.788 --> 13:49.829
- Oh, is that right?

13:49.830 --> 13:50.830
Well let me tell you,

13:50.831 --> 13:53.416
find me a little gork in
there tonight named Garth.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.627
I'm gonna ask him for an
extra pair of long underwear,

13:55.628 --> 13:56.878
because it's getting as cold

13:56.879 --> 13:58.922
as a hound's pecker in December out here.

13:58.923 --> 14:00.673
- I'll keep you warm, Wes.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.008
- The name is Seth,

14:02.009 --> 14:03.718
and you've got a date,
you little beach bunny.

14:03.719 --> 14:06.304
(giggling)

14:06.305 --> 14:08.933
(ominous music)

14:13.604 --> 14:16.273
(hawk shrieking)

14:39.088 --> 14:40.463
- Hey, let's party!

14:40.464 --> 14:42.340
- [Seth] Alright!

14:42.341 --> 14:43.383
- Quaaludes.

14:43.384 --> 14:45.093
- [Seth] Lookie here!

14:45.094 --> 14:46.261
- And Jack Daniel's.

14:46.262 --> 14:47.679
- Okay!

14:47.680 --> 14:50.390
- You sure caught onto the
American lifestyle fast.

14:50.391 --> 14:51.850
- And...

14:51.851 --> 14:52.725
Music.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.977
(light rock music)

14:53.978 --> 14:55.228
- Oh my gosh.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.356
This is one radical chick!

14:58.816 --> 14:59.567
Alright!

15:01.694 --> 15:04.487
- I thought Peter was supposed
to search you before he left.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.446
- He did, and he took half an ounce

15:05.447 --> 15:06.823
of excellent Columbian from me,

15:06.824 --> 15:08.241
and half a gram of coke.

15:08.242 --> 15:09.534
- Please don't tell me
where he found them,

15:09.535 --> 15:11.536
I'll just get so jealous.

15:11.537 --> 15:12.704
- Don't be jealous, love.

15:12.705 --> 15:15.164
There's plenty for everybody.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.376
(whimpers)

15:21.839 --> 15:24.675
(playful shouting)

15:32.975 --> 15:35.060
- Last call from the bar.

15:41.358 --> 15:44.653
(soft orchestral music)

15:51.785 --> 15:54.455
(fire crackling)

16:05.007 --> 16:09.385
I don't think it's gonna
get much cozier than this.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.429
- So you live around here?

16:11.430 --> 16:13.641
- [Jeff] Yeah, around here.

16:14.475 --> 16:16.101
- Where around here?

16:18.604 --> 16:19.521
- Hillsdown.

16:20.564 --> 16:21.690
- Oh, so rich.

16:24.318 --> 16:27.445
- [Jeff] You say that
like I have a disease.

16:27.446 --> 16:29.990
- What's it like to be so rich?

16:31.408 --> 16:35.495
- You see, that's why I never
tell anybody where I'm from.

16:35.496 --> 16:37.246
- Yeah, but shouldn't your name be

16:37.247 --> 16:40.458
Bentley Rhasmus Fairchild
the third or fourth,

16:40.459 --> 16:42.336
or something like that?

16:43.420 --> 16:46.047
- [Jeff] What makes it so evil to be rich,

16:46.048 --> 16:47.967
and so noble to be poor?

16:49.426 --> 16:51.844
- It's just that the rich capitalist

16:51.845 --> 16:55.307
feeds on the life of the downtrodden poor.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.685
- Figures, a radical.

16:58.686 --> 17:00.353
Probably majoring in political science

17:00.354 --> 17:03.564
with an emphasis on terrorism?

17:03.565 --> 17:08.152
- No, actually I don't
give a darn about politics.

17:08.153 --> 17:13.116
I'm beginning not to give a
darn about sororities either.

17:13.117 --> 17:15.284
(rock music)

17:15.285 --> 17:16.994
(chuckling)

17:16.996 --> 17:18.622
- You silly bastard.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.050
- Hey!

17:31.051 --> 17:33.177
- Robin Hood to the rescue!

17:33.178 --> 17:34.178
Come on you little--

17:34.179 --> 17:35.013
- Hang on!

17:35.014 --> 17:36.806
Is that all you're after?

17:36.807 --> 17:37.765
- Huh?

17:37.766 --> 17:39.058
- Is that all you're interested in, sex?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.268
- What are you talking about?

17:40.269 --> 17:43.021
- I mean, don't you do
anything but drink and screw?

17:43.022 --> 17:44.814
- Yeah, I surf.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.399
I surf, drink, and screw.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.525
(chortling)

17:47.526 --> 17:49.110
- Well, there's something, then.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.737
Tell me what it's like to surf.

17:50.738 --> 17:52.989
- Boy, you are some buzzy chick.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.532
I mean, first you're all
hot to get me up here,

17:54.533 --> 17:55.950
and now you want to talk?

17:55.951 --> 17:57.910
- We'll get to that later!

17:57.911 --> 17:59.829
First tell me what it's like to surf.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.750
- Well, it's like the ultimate rush.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.669
Paddling out...

18:06.670 --> 18:08.880
The winds are blowing offshore.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.340
(whooshing)

18:11.341 --> 18:13.426
Four to six foot swells are rolling in.

18:13.427 --> 18:14.969
(rumbling)

18:14.970 --> 18:16.846
And I'm riding my most radical stick,

18:16.847 --> 18:18.306
an 18 inch pinner-gun.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.683
- 18 inches, oh my goodness!

18:20.684 --> 18:21.517
- All of a sudden,

18:21.518 --> 18:23.978
a perfect six footer starts towards me.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.688
I turn around, two, three strokes,

18:25.689 --> 18:26.856
and I'm dropping in!

18:26.857 --> 18:27.899
- Two or three strokes?

18:27.900 --> 18:28.983
That didn't take long.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.068
- And just as I hit the bottom,

18:30.069 --> 18:31.444
I throw the most radical bottom turn

18:31.445 --> 18:32.737
straight up the face,

18:32.738 --> 18:34.739
hit the lip so hard I do a layback!

18:34.740 --> 18:36.115
- Now you're talking!

18:36.116 --> 18:38.326
- I get back down the
wave, get completely tubed,

18:38.327 --> 18:40.244
totally surrounded by
water for an instant,

18:40.245 --> 18:41.370
and then what do I do?

18:41.371 --> 18:42.705
I kick out!

18:42.706 --> 18:44.499
(yelping)

18:44.500 --> 18:46.000
- Sounds wonderful.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.043
- It is.

18:47.044 --> 18:48.002
Now if you behave,

18:48.003 --> 18:49.295
maybe I'll take you
surfing again sometime!

18:49.296 --> 18:51.465
(laughing)

18:52.424 --> 18:54.717
(engine rumbling)

18:54.718 --> 18:57.346
(pensive music)

19:19.785 --> 19:20.827
- [Peter] Dammit, Scott!

19:20.828 --> 19:22.287
Not so much noise!

19:46.311 --> 19:47.353
- Shh!

19:47.354 --> 19:48.105
- Alright.

19:52.943 --> 19:54.777
Alright, you guys go
on up to the north side

19:54.778 --> 19:55.987
and set things up.

19:55.988 --> 19:57.280
I'll go the other way.

19:57.281 --> 19:58.656
And keep out of sight!

19:58.657 --> 20:00.367
- Now the fun begins.

20:11.336 --> 20:14.089
- What are you doing here anyway?

20:16.175 --> 20:18.301
- You'll have to ask my
father that question.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.636
- Why do you say that?

20:20.637 --> 20:21.555
- Because...

20:22.931 --> 20:26.601
He's the one that wanted
me to join Alpha Sigma Rho.

20:26.602 --> 20:27.810
- Why?

20:27.811 --> 20:30.146
- Because he was one.

20:30.147 --> 20:34.276
It builds relationships
you'll have your whole life.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.945
- And what kind of man is your father?

20:37.946 --> 20:40.323
- He's kinda like the father
on Leave It To Beaver.

20:40.324 --> 20:42.533
Just hangs around the
house in his sweater.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.827
Doesn't seem to go to work that much.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.329
- I don't meet too many guys

20:46.330 --> 20:49.498
who do what their fathers want them to do.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.126
I think that's nice.

20:52.878 --> 20:53.878
- No.

20:53.879 --> 20:57.424
You just don't meet
many guys who admit it.

21:01.386 --> 21:04.056
(pensive music)

21:22.699 --> 21:23.450
- Come on!

21:33.335 --> 21:35.378
- So now you know why I'm here.

21:35.379 --> 21:36.880
What's your excuse?

21:38.924 --> 21:40.299
- I don't know.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.593
Seemed like the thing to do at the time.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.512
All my friends are joining sororities.

21:44.513 --> 21:47.640
- Smart girl like you
giving into peer pressure?

21:47.641 --> 21:48.392
- No.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.437
Actually, I didn't make out so bad.

21:53.438 --> 21:56.232
I made a deal with May, the
president of the sorority.

21:56.233 --> 21:58.484
If I supply all the English lit notes,

21:58.485 --> 22:01.195
I get any room in the house, free clothes,

22:01.196 --> 22:04.323
and a car to toodle around in.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.825
The car's not so bad.

22:05.826 --> 22:07.493
I had to a little bit
of work on the brakes,

22:07.494 --> 22:10.788
and the shoes are okay, so it works great.

22:10.789 --> 22:13.582
- Wait a second, you
replaced the brakes yourself?

22:13.583 --> 22:15.167
- Yeah.

22:15.168 --> 22:18.504
- [Jeff] Where'd you learn to do that?

22:18.505 --> 22:20.840
- My father owns a garage,

22:20.841 --> 22:24.386
and I worked in it all
through high school.

22:26.096 --> 22:30.057
- You know, my car's been
making these pained noises.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.225
I think it's the valves--

22:31.226 --> 22:35.355
- Now you know why I don't
tell anybody I'm a mechanic.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.194
- Ow!

22:42.195 --> 22:43.237
- Shh!

22:43.238 --> 22:45.156
- What the hell is this hole?

22:45.157 --> 22:47.158
(giggling)

22:47.159 --> 22:48.868
- It's ventilation for under the house.

22:48.869 --> 22:50.119
There's all sorts of secret rooms

22:50.120 --> 22:51.829
and tunnels running underneath there.

22:51.830 --> 22:55.959
There's a bunch of these vents
all around the outer wall.

22:57.878 --> 22:59.003
Look, don't go underneath the house,

22:59.004 --> 23:00.212
I've got it all wired up.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.756
Besides, it's a mess down there.

23:01.757 --> 23:04.091
You might get lost in one of the tunnels.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.343
- Gee, thanks a lot Scott,

23:05.344 --> 23:06.886
I was just about to slip under there

23:06.887 --> 23:08.054
and grab a quick nap!

23:08.055 --> 23:12.184
- (laughs) Come on, let's get going.

23:30.619 --> 23:33.162
- You're so down on all
this fraternity stuff.

23:33.163 --> 23:34.539
Why are you here?

23:35.957 --> 23:38.459
- (sighs) I've been wondering
the same thing all night.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.754
(screaming)

23:42.756 --> 23:44.549
It came from upstairs.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.017
- What happened?

23:59.189 --> 24:00.398
- What are you people screaming about?

24:00.399 --> 24:02.024
- We weren't screaming.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.192
- Wait a second.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.527
If you weren't screaming,

24:04.528 --> 24:06.404
and we weren't screaming...

24:06.405 --> 24:08.447
Somebody's trying to mind-fuck us.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.324
- What happened, Wes?

24:10.325 --> 24:11.659
(smooth rock music)

24:11.660 --> 24:13.786
- My name is Seth, darling.

24:13.787 --> 24:15.287
And I don't know, but it looks like

24:15.288 --> 24:17.039
we have a little trick-or-treat
going on around here.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.334
(screaming)

24:21.086 --> 24:22.962
That's coming from the third floor.

24:22.963 --> 24:23.839
- Let's go.

24:29.094 --> 24:31.221
(moaning)

24:47.529 --> 24:49.781
(screaming)

24:59.833 --> 25:00.666
Here it is.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.460
- Where?

25:03.086 --> 25:06.380
- They ran this wire in through the roof.

25:06.381 --> 25:07.381
You got a knife?

25:07.382 --> 25:08.674
- No, you got a gun?

25:08.675 --> 25:10.217
- Yeah, but it's downstairs, why?

25:10.218 --> 25:11.594
- Well, because if that
thing screams again,

25:11.595 --> 25:13.889
I'm gonna shoot it to death!

25:18.143 --> 25:20.895
- It's connected with screws in the back.

25:20.896 --> 25:22.104
I'll try to undo it with my nail.

25:22.105 --> 25:24.816
- [Denise] Did you find anything?

25:26.526 --> 25:27.860
- It's alright ladies,

25:27.861 --> 25:32.031
it looks like we've
apprehended the culprit.

25:32.032 --> 25:34.867
(clicking)

25:34.868 --> 25:35.660
- Shit.

25:37.621 --> 25:39.414
They must've found it.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.003
- (gasps) Dammit, you scared me.

25:46.004 --> 25:48.714
- Shh, keep your voice down!

25:48.715 --> 25:50.007
Nice atmosphere, huh?

25:50.008 --> 25:54.137
- Yeah, if you want to scare
the crap out of somebody.

25:56.264 --> 25:57.097
- Are we ready yet?

25:57.098 --> 25:58.891
- [Scott] Just about.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.935
- Okay May, you go around to the side

26:00.936 --> 26:02.269
and start the diversion.

26:02.270 --> 26:03.854
- Why don't you go start the diversion?

26:03.855 --> 26:05.022
- Because I want to watch.

26:05.023 --> 26:06.565
- Well, I want to watch, too!

26:06.566 --> 26:08.817
- May, don't give me a problem.

26:08.818 --> 26:11.320
You'll get your kicks later.

26:11.321 --> 26:12.072
- Jesus!

26:13.406 --> 26:15.282
You know, if you guys spent
half the time studying

26:15.283 --> 26:17.034
as you do setting up these stunts,

26:17.035 --> 26:19.871
we'd all be graduating with honors!

26:21.039 --> 26:22.456
- What a little twat!

26:22.457 --> 26:24.124
We should've left her behind.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.125
- Why?

26:25.126 --> 26:26.585
Her behind is the best part.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.505
We should've kept her behind
and left the rest of her!

26:29.506 --> 26:31.758
(chuckling)

26:33.343 --> 26:36.346
(light piano music)

26:47.816 --> 26:50.235
(owl hooting)

27:10.755 --> 27:11.755
(bat shrieking)

27:11.756 --> 27:13.842
(gasping)

27:21.016 --> 27:22.474
(intense music)

27:22.475 --> 27:24.769
(screaming)

27:27.105 --> 27:29.357
(grunting)

27:49.628 --> 27:51.880
(screaming)

27:55.133 --> 27:57.635
- I think they're done
scaring us for the night.

27:57.636 --> 28:00.179
- I hope so, but I doubt it.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.848
Maybe they're sneaking
around outside, watching us.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.892
- You think so?

28:04.893 --> 28:06.560
Well, what do you think is out there?

28:06.561 --> 28:07.394
Maybe Peter--

28:07.395 --> 28:09.689
(screaming)

28:10.815 --> 28:13.901
Are they gonna do this all night?

28:13.902 --> 28:14.902
- I hope not.

28:14.903 --> 28:17.238
Wait here, I'll check it out.

28:25.538 --> 28:28.290
- Somebody's got some sense of humor.

28:28.291 --> 28:29.792
- I can see that.

28:29.793 --> 28:32.836
(laughing)

28:32.837 --> 28:35.464
(moaning)

28:35.465 --> 28:36.257
Come on.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.392
It's coming from in here.

28:46.393 --> 28:49.354
(light piano music)

28:53.441 --> 28:56.194
(wind whooshing)

29:05.328 --> 29:06.955
- Jeff, is that you?

29:24.556 --> 29:28.184
(creepy instrumental music)

29:33.732 --> 29:36.316
Okay guys, very scary.

29:36.317 --> 29:37.861
Let's just go home.

29:39.237 --> 29:41.990
(chains clinking)

29:44.576 --> 29:46.703
(moaning)

29:51.416 --> 29:53.292
Oh, you guys.

29:53.293 --> 29:54.043
Terrific.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.047
(moaning)

30:01.885 --> 30:03.343
May!

30:03.344 --> 30:04.970
Peter!

30:04.971 --> 30:05.847
I'm scared!

30:07.348 --> 30:08.892
Please turn it off!

30:29.078 --> 30:31.247
(yelping)

30:33.291 --> 30:35.751
- Looks like she's been
waiting for you, sport.

30:35.752 --> 30:36.752
- What happened?

30:36.753 --> 30:38.629
- I just had a little trick played on me.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.172
I got locked in there with a ghost.

30:40.173 --> 30:41.340
- Did you see somebody?

30:41.341 --> 30:43.759
- A walking corpse.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.302
- Wow, that sounds very interesting.

30:45.303 --> 30:46.804
You know, I'd like to stay down here

30:46.805 --> 30:48.514
and really help you look
for your little corpse,

30:48.515 --> 30:50.432
but I've got a girl
upstairs who needs my body.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.059
Here you go!

30:52.060 --> 30:53.435
- Don't pay any attention to him.

30:53.436 --> 30:55.729
- Oh, I'm trying not to.

30:55.730 --> 30:57.815
- Show me what happened.

30:57.816 --> 30:59.525
- I think that little weasel Scott

30:59.526 --> 31:01.026
had something to do with this.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.653
- I'm sure he had some help from Peter.

31:02.654 --> 31:04.196
These are the guys I'm
building relationships

31:04.197 --> 31:05.906
that will last me a lifetime.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.241
- Look, anyway, I was sitting over there

31:07.242 --> 31:08.700
and the doors blew open,

31:08.701 --> 31:10.536
and the candles went
out, and I ran over here,

31:10.537 --> 31:12.538
and then these doors shut.

31:12.539 --> 31:14.998
And then I heard this moaning
and groaning behind me,

31:14.999 --> 31:16.333
and I turned around,

31:16.334 --> 31:18.752
and there was the ghost of
Raymond Garth coming at me.

31:18.753 --> 31:20.337
- Where'd it come from?

31:20.338 --> 31:21.798
- From over there.

31:27.262 --> 31:28.346
- Over there.

31:34.394 --> 31:37.063
(stone grinding)

31:42.026 --> 31:44.570
Now it's time for the old
magical looking glass routine.

31:44.571 --> 31:46.113
- I'm going up to the
roof to start phase two,

31:46.114 --> 31:47.365
physical terror!

31:49.450 --> 31:50.993
- You know something, Scott,

31:50.994 --> 31:52.995
I think you enjoy this a little too much.

31:52.996 --> 31:55.206
(laughing)

32:18.396 --> 32:19.813
- There's probably a switch or something

32:19.814 --> 32:21.774
controlling those doors.

32:23.568 --> 32:24.444
I found it.

32:29.449 --> 32:30.617
Close the door.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.334
Okay, now try it.

32:42.295 --> 32:43.129
- Nothing!

32:46.966 --> 32:48.509
- Okay, try it now.

32:52.597 --> 32:54.682
- You're right, it opens.

32:58.770 --> 32:59.604
- Peter!

33:01.022 --> 33:01.814
Scott!

33:02.982 --> 33:05.317
And all the rest of you!

33:05.318 --> 33:06.945
We know you're here!

33:08.446 --> 33:10.155
There's been a lot of laughs,

33:10.156 --> 33:14.243
but why don't we just shut the
fun-house off now, alright?

33:18.373 --> 33:21.000
(ominous music)

33:58.413 --> 34:00.581
(snapping)

34:10.425 --> 34:13.427
(rustling)

34:13.428 --> 34:15.303
- Who's there?

34:15.304 --> 34:16.848
Peter, is that you?

35:41.599 --> 35:43.559
Cut the bullshit, Peter.

35:46.104 --> 35:48.773
(intense music)

35:56.280 --> 35:59.616
- I thought you disconnected the screamer.

35:59.617 --> 36:00.992
- We did.

36:00.993 --> 36:04.204
- Well then how come I heard
someone screaming a while ago?

36:04.205 --> 36:05.705
- Because they probably
hooked up a bunch of speakers

36:05.706 --> 36:07.749
all over this place.

36:07.750 --> 36:10.418
They want some backup in
case we unhook some of them.

36:10.419 --> 36:12.754
- They, who's they?

36:12.755 --> 36:13.964
- I don't know.

36:13.965 --> 36:15.006
Peter.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.424
Scott, Chris.

36:16.425 --> 36:19.804
Some of the other Alpha Sigma Rho people.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.477
This place looks clean.

36:27.979 --> 36:30.189
(rattling)

36:31.315 --> 36:33.233
- Except in the closet.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.694
I swear, it's such bullshit.

36:35.695 --> 36:37.946
- Don't get mad at me.

36:37.947 --> 36:38.739
- I'm not.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.199
So is everything okay now?

36:41.200 --> 36:43.410
No more visitors in the closet?

36:43.411 --> 36:46.663
No secret passageways or screamers?

36:46.664 --> 36:47.623
- I think so.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.751
- Good, I'm going to bed.

36:57.425 --> 36:59.760
- I suggest you do the same.

37:07.643 --> 37:08.477
Wrong bed.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.205
Jeff?

37:29.332 --> 37:30.124
- Yeah?

37:32.793 --> 37:34.629
- Blow out the candle.

37:42.762 --> 37:46.265
(soft instrumental music)

38:10.539 --> 38:12.708
(knocking)

38:51.580 --> 38:53.791
(knocking)

39:04.552 --> 39:06.804
(knocking)

41:22.231 --> 41:24.774
(yelping)

41:24.775 --> 41:26.401
- Cute, guys.

41:26.402 --> 41:27.361
Really cute.

41:38.664 --> 41:41.792
These quaaludes are murdering my skin.

41:43.002 --> 41:43.836
- Shit.

42:04.648 --> 42:05.483
Scott!

42:07.818 --> 42:08.652
Hey Scott!

42:20.581 --> 42:22.458
Hey, you guys up there?

42:48.317 --> 42:50.528
Hey Scott, are you up here?

43:04.667 --> 43:07.628
(suspenseful music)

43:13.551 --> 43:14.676
Scott!

43:14.677 --> 43:15.469
May!

43:16.929 --> 43:18.472
Where are you guys?

43:56.677 --> 43:57.469
Scott!

44:21.410 --> 44:24.246
(pulley creaking)

45:04.828 --> 45:07.498
(intense music)

46:04.471 --> 46:06.682
(snarling)

46:47.556 --> 46:50.517
(suspenseful music)

48:01.213 --> 48:03.674
(eerie music)

48:24.778 --> 48:25.779
- I'm sorry.

48:26.822 --> 48:29.074
It's just I couldn't sleep.

48:29.950 --> 48:31.118
- That's okay.

48:32.411 --> 48:35.955
Maybe we could just sit
here and talk a while?

48:35.956 --> 48:37.583
- Whatever you want.

48:38.959 --> 48:41.169
- Do you believe in ghosts?

48:42.170 --> 48:42.921
- No.

48:45.757 --> 48:48.843
- When I was a kid, I
thought I saw a witch.

48:48.844 --> 48:53.014
You know how you wake up and see things?

48:53.015 --> 48:56.267
- You know, I saw an elf once.

48:56.268 --> 48:57.060
- An elf?

48:59.104 --> 49:01.063
How do you know it was an elf?

49:01.064 --> 49:04.233
- Well, what would you
call a three foot man,

49:04.234 --> 49:07.069
white beard, pointed ears, red cap.

49:07.070 --> 49:09.114
- A typical textbook elf.

49:10.574 --> 49:13.451
Okay, wow, I think you better
keep that story to yourself.

49:13.452 --> 49:15.036
It's pretty bizarre.

49:15.037 --> 49:17.496
- What about you and your witch?

49:17.497 --> 49:18.789
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

49:18.790 --> 49:21.042
They're both pretty weird.

49:21.043 --> 49:23.295
- Well, I won't tell on you,

49:24.421 --> 49:26.340
if you won't tell on me.

49:27.549 --> 49:30.510
(light piano music)

49:43.106 --> 49:47.235
- So I guess us weirdos will
just have to stick together.

50:01.792 --> 50:04.544
(fire crackling)

50:10.509 --> 50:12.718
(moaning)

50:12.719 --> 50:15.680
(groovy rock music)

50:15.681 --> 50:16.765
- Oh Wes, Wes!

50:19.226 --> 50:20.434
- It's Seth, dammit.

50:20.435 --> 50:21.228
Seth!

50:25.023 --> 50:27.275
(giggling)

50:31.571 --> 50:34.241
(ominous music)

51:30.380 --> 51:32.632
(giggling)

51:41.600 --> 51:43.726
Well, time for the john.

51:43.727 --> 51:45.227
- John?

51:45.228 --> 51:47.606
I thought your name was Seth.

51:57.949 --> 52:00.368
(eerie music)

52:48.542 --> 52:50.710
(gasping)

52:52.129 --> 52:54.923
(toilet flushing)

53:02.931 --> 53:06.059
- Score another one for the good guys.

53:15.735 --> 53:17.236
(whistling)

53:17.237 --> 53:19.447
(slapping)

53:32.127 --> 53:34.212
Finally crashed out, huh?

53:55.442 --> 53:57.944
(eerie music)

54:05.160 --> 54:07.495
(screaming)

54:10.415 --> 54:12.374
- That sounds like Seth!

54:12.375 --> 54:13.210
- Let's go.

54:16.922 --> 54:17.756
Come on.

54:23.261 --> 54:24.429
What happened?

54:25.305 --> 54:26.555
- She's dead.

54:26.556 --> 54:27.556
- Who's dead?

54:27.557 --> 54:30.852
- I don't know man, that sorority chick.

54:33.897 --> 54:36.440
(shrill music)

54:36.441 --> 54:37.400
- Oh my God!

54:38.860 --> 54:39.694
- Run!

54:43.657 --> 54:44.531
Where's Denise?

54:44.532 --> 54:45.324
- I don't know, I don't know!

54:45.325 --> 54:46.200
- What do you mean you don't know?

54:46.201 --> 54:47.409
- Where are you going?

54:47.410 --> 54:49.119
- There's a dead chick up there, sport.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.162
I'm getting the hell out of here.

54:50.163 --> 54:51.205
Give me that gun!

54:51.206 --> 54:52.039
- Seth!

54:52.040 --> 54:53.666
- What are you gonna do?

54:53.667 --> 54:55.084
- Seth!

54:55.085 --> 54:57.836
Seth, will you tell us what happened?

54:57.837 --> 54:59.421
- I don't know man, I don't know!

54:59.422 --> 55:00.506
Went out to take a leak,

55:00.507 --> 55:01.548
when I came back, Denise is gone,

55:01.549 --> 55:02.800
and there's a dead chick in my bed.

55:02.801 --> 55:03.842
The whole world's gone mad!

55:03.843 --> 55:04.677
- And you don't know where Denise is?

55:04.678 --> 55:05.928
- I don't know where anyone is.

55:05.929 --> 55:07.429
I just know that I am getting out of here.

55:07.430 --> 55:09.181
- Wait, no!

55:09.182 --> 55:10.266
Seth, wait!

55:10.267 --> 55:11.935
- Seth, where is she?

55:14.896 --> 55:16.480
- Seth, Seth!

55:16.481 --> 55:17.648
- [Marti] Would you guys wait up?

55:17.649 --> 55:18.941
What are you guys doing?

55:18.942 --> 55:20.985
- Seth, hold on!

55:20.986 --> 55:22.236
Seth, wait!

55:22.237 --> 55:23.320
- Leave me alone, man!

55:23.321 --> 55:24.613
(gunfire)

55:24.614 --> 55:26.324
- What are you doing?

55:29.119 --> 55:30.035
- Blanks!

55:30.036 --> 55:31.246
Those bastards!

55:33.164 --> 55:34.415
- Seth, what the hell are you doing?

55:34.416 --> 55:35.332
- I'm getting out of here, sport.

55:35.333 --> 55:36.583
- Well, what about Marti?

55:36.584 --> 55:37.418
We can't just leave her here.

55:37.419 --> 55:38.252
She can't climb this gate.

55:38.253 --> 55:39.503
- Leave me alone, man!

55:39.504 --> 55:40.505
- Be careful!

55:41.715 --> 55:42.798
- Seth, you're gonna kill yourself

55:42.799 --> 55:44.258
trying to get over in your boots!

55:44.259 --> 55:45.134
- Look out, man!

55:45.135 --> 55:46.135
- Listen, Seth!

55:46.136 --> 55:47.594
Seth, take off your boots and
I'll throw them over to you

55:47.595 --> 55:49.763
when you get to the other side.

55:49.764 --> 55:50.974
- Son of a gun!

55:52.058 --> 55:55.102
- When you get the time,
you gotta call the police.

55:55.103 --> 55:56.395
Seth, do you understand?

55:56.396 --> 55:57.229
You gotta get help!

55:57.230 --> 56:00.649
- Man, I understand, I understand.

56:00.650 --> 56:02.109
- [Marti] I'm gonna try.

56:02.110 --> 56:03.610
- [Jeff] You'll never make it.

56:03.611 --> 56:06.864
- I'm gonna try, will you help me?

56:06.865 --> 56:09.075
(grunting)

56:20.545 --> 56:23.214
(intense music)

56:30.930 --> 56:31.681
Seth!

56:39.564 --> 56:40.315
Seth!

56:43.318 --> 56:44.110
Seth!

57:09.511 --> 57:10.261
Careful!

57:19.771 --> 57:21.940
(grunting)

57:29.447 --> 57:31.156
- Seth, are you alright!

57:31.157 --> 57:32.908
- I'll live.

57:32.909 --> 57:35.537
Throw me the damn boots, will ya?

57:41.793 --> 57:43.919
- Are you gonna be able to make it?

57:43.920 --> 57:46.088
- I'll make it, sport, I'll make it.

57:46.089 --> 57:47.173
- Seth, hurry!

57:49.884 --> 57:51.970
- I will, darling, I will!

58:01.563 --> 58:04.524
(light piano music)

58:18.329 --> 58:21.916
- We gotta go back in
there and find Denise.

01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:25.456
Denise!

01:00:27.709 --> 01:00:28.501
- Denise!

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:09.459
- Denise!

01:01:21.971 --> 01:01:24.057
(tapping)

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.419
(ominous music)

01:02:00.677 --> 01:02:01.511
Denise!

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:12.582
(shrill music)

01:03:23.509 --> 01:03:26.386
(rapping)

01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:27.888
- Open the door!

01:03:27.889 --> 01:03:29.097
Please!

01:03:29.098 --> 01:03:30.224
Somebody help!

01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:48.117
(tires screeching)

01:03:53.748 --> 01:03:55.916
(car honking)

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:57.083
Hey man, there's been a murder man!

01:03:57.084 --> 01:03:58.084
You gotta stop!

01:03:58.085 --> 01:04:00.046
- Hit the road, asshole!

01:04:10.348 --> 01:04:12.767
(eerie music)

01:04:22.193 --> 01:04:24.028
- So what do we do now?

01:04:26.823 --> 01:04:27.573
- We wait.

01:04:30.952 --> 01:04:32.494
- You think that story about the Garths

01:04:32.495 --> 01:04:34.705
and little Andrew was true?

01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:37.625
- I don't know.

01:04:39.794 --> 01:04:41.628
- This was supposed to be a joke.

01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:43.171
I can't believe it.

01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:44.256
- Wait a minute!

01:04:44.257 --> 01:04:48.052
There's light coming
from the garden out here.

01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:52.848
I gotta go down there.

01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:54.099
- Don't go down there!

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.600
You'll get yourself killed.

01:04:55.601 --> 01:04:56.768
- What if it's Denise down there

01:04:56.769 --> 01:04:57.769
and she needs our help?

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:59.688
- And what if it's Andrew?

01:04:59.689 --> 01:05:00.773
- Don't worry.

01:05:02.358 --> 01:05:03.776
- Jeff, don't go!

01:05:04.986 --> 01:05:06.946
- Marti, just stay here.

01:05:08.614 --> 01:05:10.407
Put the chair back after I'm gone.

01:05:10.408 --> 01:05:14.786
- Jeff, I don't want
to be left alone here!

01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:18.332
(light instrumental music)

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:22.962
- It's gonna be okay.

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:49.071
(suspenseful music)

01:08:37.573 --> 01:08:40.242
(intense music)

01:09:20.032 --> 01:09:22.618
(radio chatter)

01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:26.703
- Hey, help!

01:09:26.705 --> 01:09:29.290
There's been a murder!

01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:30.166
(phone ringing)

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:31.084
- Sam, can you handle this for me?

01:09:31.085 --> 01:09:32.127
- Yeah.

01:09:32.127 --> 01:09:33.545
- What fraternity are you with?

01:09:33.546 --> 01:09:35.130
- The Alpha Sigma Rho.

01:09:35.131 --> 01:09:38.675
- And that little wiseguy
Peter Bennett's president, huh?

01:09:38.676 --> 01:09:40.093
Well you go back up there

01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:42.095
and you tell that little
smartass president of yours

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:44.221
that if I even see
another Alpha Sig tonight

01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:46.432
I'm gonna throw his butt
in jail for 30 days!

01:09:46.433 --> 01:09:48.059
- Wait a second, you don't understand!

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:49.144
This is for real!

01:09:49.145 --> 01:09:50.728
We were up at Garth Manor
and somebody was killed!

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:52.689
- Hey Ross, I got another one
for the tank for you here.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.232
- What?

01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:55.567
No, no, this is no stunt!

01:09:55.568 --> 01:09:57.652
Listen, there's kids up
there getting murdered!

01:09:57.653 --> 01:09:59.946
- Son, you kids have been getting away

01:09:59.947 --> 01:10:01.406
with murder all night long.

01:10:01.407 --> 01:10:02.866
Now either you get the hell out of here,

01:10:02.867 --> 01:10:05.243
or you're gonna spend the night in jail.

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:07.580
- You heard him, now move it.

01:10:49.997 --> 01:10:51.456
No, I'm sorry.

01:10:51.457 --> 01:10:52.749
I'm sorry, but we'll send a unit

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.168
as soon as one is available.

01:10:55.169 --> 01:10:55.920
Okay.

01:10:57.213 --> 01:10:59.798
(bells ringing)

01:11:08.349 --> 01:11:10.935
(ominous music)

01:11:37.628 --> 01:11:41.089
- How long do you think Seth's been gone?

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:43.968
- Couple hours maybe, I don't know.

01:11:49.014 --> 01:11:51.724
- Do you think we're gonna make it?

01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:53.184
- We'll make it.

01:11:53.185 --> 01:11:55.813
All we can do is wait right now.

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.653
It's gonna be okay.

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.990
(eerie music)

01:12:38.314 --> 01:12:40.649
(screaming)

01:12:42.693 --> 01:12:44.862
(grunting)

01:13:20.606 --> 01:13:22.691
(panting)

01:13:38.165 --> 01:13:39.249
Pull it back.

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:05.233
He's still alive!

01:14:05.234 --> 01:14:07.694
And he's down there someplace.

01:14:09.655 --> 01:14:10.863
I'm going after him.

01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:11.864
- Are you crazy?

01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:13.825
- Look, I'm not waiting for
him to come back here again!

01:14:13.826 --> 01:14:15.493
- What about Seth, Seth
is bringing back help.

01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:16.494
- Seth isn't coming back!

01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:17.495
- What do you mean?

01:14:17.496 --> 01:14:18.413
- Because if he was coming back

01:14:18.414 --> 01:14:19.622
he would've been here by now!

01:14:19.623 --> 01:14:21.124
- Then we'll wait, we'll
wait until morning.

01:14:21.125 --> 01:14:23.709
Peter and the other kids will be here.

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:25.461
- Peter's dead.

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:26.295
- What?

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:27.380
- I found him out there in the garden,

01:14:27.381 --> 01:14:29.590
I didn't want to tell you before.

01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:32.635
(whimpering)

01:14:32.636 --> 01:14:36.098
Okay, just stay here, I'm going after him.

01:14:37.099 --> 01:14:39.226
- No, I'm coming with you!

01:14:40.853 --> 01:14:43.814
(suspenseful music)

01:16:01.475 --> 01:16:02.935
- Watch your head.

01:16:22.538 --> 01:16:24.580
- Jeff, this is crazy.

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:26.332
- I'm not stopping 'til I get him.

01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:27.458
He knows this house better than we do,

01:16:27.459 --> 01:16:29.252
and if we don't get him
now, he's gonna get us.

01:16:29.253 --> 01:16:30.461
- We're at the basement already.

01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:32.255
Let's go back.

01:16:32.256 --> 01:16:33.173
- I'm not...

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:35.884
It goes deeper.

01:16:37.427 --> 01:16:38.178
Come on.

01:17:40.741 --> 01:17:42.367
He must be in there.

01:17:44.578 --> 01:17:45.370
Come on.

01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:10.728
There must be tunnels leading
all over under this place.

01:18:10.729 --> 01:18:12.146
- Please, let's go back.

01:18:12.147 --> 01:18:14.650
We're gonna get lost down here.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.945
- Let's take a look.

01:18:19.946 --> 01:18:23.658
There's some sort of light down there.

01:18:23.659 --> 01:18:26.119
(eerie music)

01:19:17.671 --> 01:19:19.171
(gasping)

01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:21.758
(intense music)

01:19:33.812 --> 01:19:35.939
(banging)

01:19:44.531 --> 01:19:46.700
(grunting)

01:19:53.081 --> 01:19:55.958
(snarling)

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:58.211
(screaming)

01:20:29.409 --> 01:20:30.327
Marti, here!

01:20:34.331 --> 01:20:36.583
(screaming)

01:20:40.337 --> 01:20:41.171
- No!

01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:49.262
Give me your arm!

01:21:34.975 --> 01:21:35.809
- Get out.

01:21:37.477 --> 01:21:38.477
- What do you want?

01:21:38.478 --> 01:21:40.813
- I want your car, now get out!

01:21:40.814 --> 01:21:41.897
- You can't do this!

01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:43.357
I'm gonna call the cops!

01:21:43.358 --> 01:21:44.733
- Good idea, tell the cops!

01:21:44.734 --> 01:21:47.445
Tell them I'll be at Garth Manor!

01:21:49.406 --> 01:21:52.284
(tires screeching)

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.292
- How's your leg?

01:22:01.293 --> 01:22:02.836
- Hurts really bad.

01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:08.632
I don't believe what was down there.

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.135
Denise is dead too.

01:22:14.556 --> 01:22:16.558
What are we gonna do now?

01:22:18.768 --> 01:22:19.978
- I don't know.

01:22:24.941 --> 01:22:26.026
I don't know.

01:22:27.569 --> 01:22:30.238
(dramatic music)

01:22:31.698 --> 01:22:34.618
(tires screeching)

01:22:46.004 --> 01:22:48.757
(shotgun pumping)

01:23:46.147 --> 01:23:49.109
(suspenseful music)

01:25:27.957 --> 01:25:30.126
(grunting)

01:25:31.169 --> 01:25:33.755
(intense music)

01:26:06.287 --> 01:26:08.956
(loud bang)

01:26:08.957 --> 01:26:11.251
(splashing)

01:26:58.089 --> 01:27:00.258
(snarling)

01:27:44.844 --> 01:27:46.386
Jeff! Marti!

01:27:46.387 --> 01:27:48.138
I killed him!

01:27:48.139 --> 01:27:49.349
I killed him...

01:27:52.018 --> 01:27:53.185
- Seth!

01:27:53.186 --> 01:27:57.231
Oh my God, we didn't think
you were coming back.

01:27:57.232 --> 01:27:58.649
- He killed everybody but us.

01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:02.237
Peter, Scott, May,
Denise, they're all dead!

01:28:03.863 --> 01:28:05.489
- The stinking cops wouldn't believe me,

01:28:05.490 --> 01:28:06.907
so I had to come here by myself.

01:28:06.908 --> 01:28:08.408
I killed him out by the pond!

01:28:08.409 --> 01:28:09.701
You should've seen him, man.

01:28:09.702 --> 01:28:10.535
It was like--

01:28:10.536 --> 01:28:11.703
(screaming)

01:28:11.704 --> 01:28:12.455
- Jeff!

01:28:13.915 --> 01:28:16.584
(intense music)

01:28:20.338 --> 01:28:22.674
(loud bang)

01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:38.898
- Seth!

01:28:43.319 --> 01:28:44.070
Seth!

01:28:49.867 --> 01:28:51.368
- I'm gonna get the gun.

01:28:51.369 --> 01:28:52.744
- No!

01:28:52.745 --> 01:28:54.706
- I'm gonna get the gun!

01:28:55.748 --> 01:28:58.251
(eerie music)

01:29:48.718 --> 01:29:49.510
Seth?

01:30:00.813 --> 01:30:01.647
Seth?

01:30:17.372 --> 01:30:18.955
(screaming)

01:30:18.956 --> 01:30:21.584
(intense music)

01:30:25.797 --> 01:30:28.049
(snarling)

01:30:33.638 --> 01:30:34.763
- Who did Seth kill?

01:30:34.764 --> 01:30:36.181
- I don't know!

01:30:36.182 --> 01:30:37.974
(mumbling)

01:30:37.975 --> 01:30:40.269
(screaming)

01:30:46.818 --> 01:30:47.568
Go!

01:30:54.992 --> 01:30:55.743
Go.

01:30:58.121 --> 01:31:00.205
(grunting)

01:31:00.206 --> 01:31:01.040
Keep going!

01:31:14.429 --> 01:31:16.889
Marti!

01:31:19.642 --> 01:31:21.936
(screaming)

01:31:27.275 --> 01:31:28.109
- Jeff!

01:31:30.069 --> 01:31:32.572
(wind howling)

01:31:53.259 --> 01:31:56.220
(suspenseful music)

01:32:27.210 --> 01:32:28.585
(glass shattering)

01:32:28.586 --> 01:32:30.838
(screaming)

01:34:02.096 --> 01:34:04.348
(screaming)

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:25.535
(wailing)

01:34:25.536 --> 01:34:28.497
(suspenseful music)

01:35:16.754 --> 01:35:19.882
(ignition sputtering)

01:35:36.607 --> 01:35:39.026
(car humming)

01:35:48.035 --> 01:35:50.913
(tires screeching)

01:35:53.874 --> 01:35:56.585
(dramatic music)

01:36:16.105 --> 01:36:18.441
(screaming)

01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:53.184
(snarling)

01:37:19.126 --> 01:37:21.212
(honking)

01:38:12.179 --> 01:38:15.140
(light piano music)
