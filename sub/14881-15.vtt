01:37.897 --> 01:41.000
But, babe, you gotta really
clean out everything.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.779
Okay, there's a little explaining to do.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.418
What about this joint right here?

01:58.485 --> 02:00.153
It's a dog bag, no?

02:00.854 --> 02:03.156
-No, it's not.
-The shearling, like, the shearling.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.344
Oh, hell no.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.259
I promise you, I'll be kind.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.030
A lot of clothes. It's crazy, right?

02:44.097 --> 02:45.732
I don't know where to start.
There's so much stuff.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.854
Let's look at the
super freshest s*** we have

03:07.921 --> 03:09.055
and like go down from that point.

03:11.157 --> 03:13.359
-I like the top. It's like, yo…
-Okay.

03:13.426 --> 03:17.363
I'm getting on best dressed list now.
I'm stepping all into this territory.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.881
Just as long as from here to here is good.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.716
Let me show you the areas.

03:36.783 --> 03:40.553
Maybe tighter, like, right in here. Yeah.

03:41.254 --> 03:43.323
You look amazing.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.103
What do you think, babe?

05:10.710 --> 05:12.412
Okay, are you ready to faint?

12:01.954 --> 12:04.457
I don't want it
if it's called Kardashian Khroma.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.559
Why not?

12:39.625 --> 12:41.527
Hi. Yeah, it's me and Kim.

12:43.796 --> 12:47.099
<i>So, Oprah wants to do
a solo interview with you.</i>

12:47.166 --> 12:51.137
<i>But we think you should
only do it with Khloé and Kourtney.</i>

12:51.203 --> 12:52.338
<i>So…</i>

12:52.404 --> 12:54.640
Well, I kinda like to do things on my own.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.109
Sometimes I like the separation

12:57.710 --> 12:59.612
because they'll, like, get to know me.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.758
Are we doing one
with the three of us or no?

13:12.825 --> 13:16.128
Do you know what the groups are, Pearl?
Aside from Kim?

13:17.029 --> 13:18.931
<i>No, they don't know yet.</i>

13:32.411 --> 13:35.581
Rob, you proved you're flaky. So, they're
not gonna want to work with you.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.951
-First of all, Kim, stop being selfish.
-I'm not being selfish.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.619
That's all you do.
You're like, "My brother's a loser."

13:40.686 --> 13:42.321
You say that.
How many times have you said it?

13:53.799 --> 13:56.335
I think Kourtney and I
should just do one in London.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.703
Open a DASH men's?

13:57.770 --> 14:03.609
It's a lot of work, and I can't do that.
I don't have the time to deal with retail.

14:03.676 --> 14:07.046
I just feel like I'm going to get cut out
and not do anything.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.682
I literally have no income.

14:09.748 --> 14:12.117
Luckily, you have no bills.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.752
I do, though.

18:13.992 --> 18:16.462
Do you want to listen
and watch what's going on?

20:10.642 --> 20:12.377
Kris, she wants to keep going.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.224
Rob, you're on the end. Is that right?

27:59.177 --> 28:01.246
<i>So, it's time for an intervention.</i>

28:02.747 --> 28:04.516
<i>The entire fam band.</i>

28:06.518 --> 28:09.754
<i>All you guys are majorly obnoxious,</i>

28:09.821 --> 28:15.427
<i>and Robert might be
OCD amongst other problems.</i>

28:15.493 --> 28:18.430
<i>Kourtney hates Mom, and I'm just perfect.</i>

28:18.496 --> 28:23.435
<i>So, therefore, I think we should have
a family intervention.</i>

28:28.406 --> 28:31.543
<i>Okay, well, Mom agreed to go,
and I feel like if Mom agrees.</i>

40:34.965 --> 40:36.767
It's just sad to see him cry.
