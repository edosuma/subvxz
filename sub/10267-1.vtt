02:53.589 --> 02:55.507
In the 16th century, during the Civil Wars,

02:55.716 --> 03:00.346
an endless cycle of conflict
left the countryside overrun by bandits.

03:00.554 --> 03:04.641
Peaceful peasants lived in terror
of the thunder of approaching hooves...

03:48.602 --> 03:51.772
Take this village too?

03:51.980 --> 03:54.650
Take it! Take it!

03:55.567 --> 03:56.985
Not so fast!

03:57.152 --> 04:01.115
We just took their rice last fall.

04:01.782 --> 04:03.242
They'll have nothing now.

04:03.742 --> 04:05.202
Very well.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.205
We'll return
when that barley's ripe!

04:40.779 --> 04:43.490
Is there no god to protect us?

04:45.284 --> 04:50.914
Land tax, forced labor,
war, drought...

04:51.582 --> 04:54.293
and now bandits!

04:58.714 --> 05:02.384
The gods want us farmers dead!

05:02.593 --> 05:05.304
That's right!
We're better off dead!

05:06.889 --> 05:11.226
What's all this?
Crying won't change anything.

05:11.685 --> 05:14.563
The magistrate can do more
than collect taxes.

05:14.730 --> 05:16.565
We can ask him for help.

05:17.566 --> 05:19.526
We know all about him!

05:19.735 --> 05:23.072
He shows up after they're gone,
acting big while he surveys the damage.

05:23.238 --> 05:25.366
That's right. He's useless.

05:25.616 --> 05:30.871
We might as well hand over
our rice and barley to the bandits

05:31.080 --> 05:33.332
and just hang ourselves!

05:33.874 --> 05:37.252
That'll bring the magistrate
here in a hurry!

05:47.888 --> 05:49.556
We'll kill those bandits.

05:50.766 --> 05:52.559
We'll kill them all.

05:52.768 --> 05:54.812
Never again!
Let's kill 'em all!

05:55.604 --> 05:57.064
Not me!

05:58.607 --> 06:00.943
I couldn't possibly --

06:03.070 --> 06:05.030
That's crazy talk.

06:06.990 --> 06:10.244
So we can kill defeated samurai
but not bandits?

06:10.911 --> 06:14.248
Stop it! This is no time
to fight amongst ourselves.

06:17.334 --> 06:21.422
We don't have a chance against bandits.
And when we lose?

06:21.630 --> 06:24.967
They'll slaughter us all,
down to the last unborn child.

06:25.134 --> 06:28.595
I've had enough!
Better to risk it all

06:28.804 --> 06:31.432
than to live like this.
Kill or be killed!

06:31.682 --> 06:33.100
Rikichi!

06:33.517 --> 06:36.270
The farmer's only choice
is to endure.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.605
We can't defy the powerful.

06:40.315 --> 06:43.152
When the bandits arrive,
we'll greet them meekly

06:43.986 --> 06:46.155
and quietly hand over
all our barley.

06:46.655 --> 06:51.201
We'll plead with them to leave
just enough for us to survive.

06:51.660 --> 06:56.790
"That's all we ask,"
we'll beg on our hands and knees.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.711
What bandit will agree to that?

07:01.128 --> 07:06.258
Have you forgotten how low we had
to stoop for the rice we're eating now?

07:27.696 --> 07:29.782
We should go see the Old Man.

07:29.990 --> 07:32.368
Let him decide what to do.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.144
<i>Consider who
we're dealing with here. </i>

08:41.812 --> 08:45.774
<i>Give a wolf a taste of your leg
and he'll ask for your hand. </i>

08:45.941 --> 08:48.736
<i>Once they have a taste,
they'll be back in the fall. </i>

08:48.986 --> 08:52.239
<i>- But what if we lose?
- Then we're no worse off!</i>

08:52.823 --> 08:55.784
<i>Without our barley,
we're doomed anyway!</i>

09:00.956 --> 09:02.166
We fight.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.086
Old Man, that's madness.

09:06.295 --> 09:08.756
We're farmers.
What do we know of battle?

09:08.964 --> 09:11.467
We'll hire samurai.

09:11.842 --> 09:15.971
Whoever heard of farmers
hiring samurai?

09:17.598 --> 09:20.309
I saw it with my own eyes,

09:21.352 --> 09:26.565
when the village you were born in
was torched.

09:27.566 --> 09:31.779
I saw it when we escaped
to this village here.

09:32.988 --> 09:39.870
The only village that didn't burn
was the one that hired samurai.

09:40.245 --> 09:43.874
But Old Man, there are
different kinds of villages and villagers.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.585
How are we to feed samurai
when we live on rice gruel?

09:46.794 --> 09:47.961
We'll make do on millet!

09:48.170 --> 09:52.508
Show me a samurai who'll fight
for farmers in return for food!

09:52.675 --> 09:54.677
They're a proud lot.

09:54.885 --> 09:55.928
Look.

09:57.137 --> 10:00.849
Find hungry samurai.

10:02.184 --> 10:07.856
Even bears come down from
the mountains when they're hungry.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.111
How dare you?

10:55.696 --> 10:59.033
You're nothing but a farmer!
I'm still a samurai!

10:59.241 --> 11:01.035
I don't need your charity!

11:04.288 --> 11:05.748
Fool!

11:12.921 --> 11:14.673
What'd I tell you?

11:47.748 --> 11:49.708
Look, the barley's ripe.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.878
Ten days already
since we left the village.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.464
What do we do?

11:57.633 --> 12:01.011
This barley's early,
not like our mountain barley.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.434
Hey, we're soaked through
to the bone.

12:07.643 --> 12:11.271
Find any cheap, strong
and foolhardy samurai?

12:50.352 --> 12:52.312
Leftovers.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.939
You can have 'em cheap.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.399
That's a laugh!

12:56.358 --> 12:58.986
- What's so funny?
- He's blind.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.906
- What about you, then?
- Not me.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.451
I'd rather eat horseshit.

13:09.788 --> 13:14.001
- Won't get a nose bleed outta him.
- Cleaned him out gambling last night.

13:14.209 --> 13:18.047
Pulled his sword when he lost,
so the three of us beat him up.

13:18.213 --> 13:20.632
Not a drop left in his nose now.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.973
Don't bother.
They only eat millet.

13:28.515 --> 13:31.226
Is that true?
You can't live like that.

13:31.435 --> 13:34.355
Without nourishment
you'll go night-blind.

13:34.646 --> 13:36.440
I've got just four left.

13:36.648 --> 13:39.276
I'll trade 'em all
for a cup of rice.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.445
What do you say?

13:44.239 --> 13:46.825
Damn! What a bunch.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.097
What a waste.

14:08.764 --> 14:13.268
If we still had that rice,
we coulda bought 40 of those.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.353
Shut up!

14:15.270 --> 14:17.398
But it's true, right?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.485
The blockhead's cracking up!

14:22.152 --> 14:24.446
What a show.
Go at it, boys.

14:29.368 --> 14:33.998
Who ever heard
of anything so unfair?

14:35.582 --> 14:41.422
We give him his fill of rice
and a free bottle of sake,

14:42.297 --> 14:45.592
and he thanks us
with a beating.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.096
Good for him!

14:49.471 --> 14:52.266
Not like this one
playing possum here.

14:52.641 --> 14:57.813
Say, let's go home.
Let's just go home.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.358
Look at him sobbing.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.235
Misses his wifey.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.488
I'd pay good money
to watch the two of 'em going at it.

15:06.697 --> 15:11.285
Let's hurry
and get back to the village.

15:11.493 --> 15:14.955
Go on home. You can't afford buns,
let alone samurai.

15:15.664 --> 15:20.002
Farmers like us know
good from bad when it comes to seed,

15:20.210 --> 15:23.005
but not when it comes
to samurai.

15:24.673 --> 15:29.011
Besides, we're no match
for the tough ones,

15:30.012 --> 15:35.642
and the only ones interested
are weaklings.

15:43.650 --> 15:48.530
If I lost last night,
it was only because I was starving.

15:49.698 --> 15:53.494
Liar! You had plenty
of money to gamble.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.871
Jerk!

15:56.038 --> 15:57.581
Wanna fight?

15:59.041 --> 16:00.751
It's a fight.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.548
Over here!
Wake up!

16:16.975 --> 16:19.728
Quit that strumming, monk!
It's depressing!

16:20.604 --> 16:23.732
Keep it up, grandpa.
We're on your side.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.390
Rikichi!

16:57.266 --> 16:58.809
Stop it, Manzo!

16:59.268 --> 17:02.229
You said we were going home,
you son of a bitch!

17:03.188 --> 17:06.150
I said we'd go home,
not bargain with bandits!

17:06.942 --> 17:09.486
If we can't hire samurai,
what's left?

17:09.694 --> 17:12.321
It's bargain or nothing!

17:13.240 --> 17:15.909
Fine, have it your way!

17:24.626 --> 17:26.086
But tell me:

17:26.920 --> 17:29.340
If we do strike a bargain,

17:29.548 --> 17:31.759
what have we got
to offer this year?

17:32.509 --> 17:34.762
Are you willing to give 'em
your daughter?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.682
Shino's a fine-lookin' girl.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.401
What's going on?

19:12.609 --> 19:17.531
There's a thief in that barn.
We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.056
How many thieves are there?

19:42.264 --> 19:43.307
Just one.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.184
One?

19:46.852 --> 19:49.438
All of you can't take
a single thief?

19:49.646 --> 19:54.485
We don't dare make a move.
He took a kid in there with him.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.446
Says he'll kill him
if we attack.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.200
Listen. Hear him?

20:06.580 --> 20:08.666
Poor thing.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.001
It all happened
in the middle of the night.

20:11.210 --> 20:15.464
Poor kid's been bawling
the better part of a day.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.801
He can barely
make a sound now.

20:22.054 --> 20:26.141
He's only seven.
Imagine how his parents feel.

20:26.350 --> 20:30.062
Who's that samurai
getting his head shaved?

20:30.270 --> 20:34.608
No idea. We asked him for help
and he agreed right away.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.777
Then he asked us
for two rice balls.

20:36.985 --> 20:41.198
He asked a monk to shave his head
and lend him his robes.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.950
No idea what he's up to.

22:15.751 --> 22:19.713
<i>Stay back!
Any closer and I kill the brat!</i>

22:19.922 --> 22:21.840
I'm a monk.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.176
<i>Stay back!</i>

22:26.011 --> 22:29.556
I'm just a monk.
I mean you no harm.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.355
I won't come in.

22:36.563 --> 22:40.651
I just thought the child
must be very hungry.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.242
I've brought some rice balls.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.245
You should eat one yourself.

22:54.039 --> 22:57.334
Won't you have one?

22:57.751 --> 22:58.669
What's wrong?

23:02.881 --> 23:04.591
<i>Throw 'em here!</i>

23:05.300 --> 23:06.427
Here.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.373
My baby!

24:47.903 --> 24:50.572
Even you can't object
to a samurai like that.

24:50.781 --> 24:53.534
Ask him quickly.
It'll be harder in town.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.677
What do you want?

25:20.602 --> 25:24.398
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto.
Please make me your disciple!

25:27.109 --> 25:28.402
Disciple?

25:28.610 --> 25:32.448
As you see, I'm a ronin.
The name is Kambei Shimada.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.326
I don't take on disciples.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.203
Get up.
I can't talk to you like this.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.623
I'm begging you --
let me be your disciple.

25:41.832 --> 25:46.670
First get off your knees.
We'll talk as we go.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.726
I'm at a loss.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.937
You think far too highly of me.

26:04.146 --> 26:04.897
No, sir --

26:05.105 --> 26:06.815
Just hear me out.

26:07.024 --> 26:10.152
There's nothing special
about me.

26:10.361 --> 26:13.614
I may have seen
my share of battle,

26:13.822 --> 26:16.784
but always on the losing side.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.745
That about sums me up.

26:19.953 --> 26:22.956
Better not to follow
such an unlucky man.

26:23.165 --> 26:28.128
No, I'm determined to follow you
whether you allow me to or not.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.963
I forbid it.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.009
I don't have the means
to travel with an attendant.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.981
Can I help you?

26:56.198 --> 26:57.908
What do you want?

27:06.166 --> 27:07.126
Insolence!

27:09.003 --> 27:11.088
Stay out of this, little chick.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.218
Are you a samurai?

27:20.389 --> 27:22.057
Damn right I am!

27:25.102 --> 27:26.812
I wonder.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.030
Bastard.

27:52.296 --> 27:53.922
Who was that?

28:00.262 --> 28:01.847
Leave him be.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.034
I beg of you, sir!

28:23.952 --> 28:27.081
You idiot.
Why don't you scram?

28:29.333 --> 28:33.212
Stubborn old fool.
They'll eat it and run like last time.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.678
It will never work.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.348
Sir, we could arm the villagers
with bamboo spears.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.142
- I thought of that.
- But, sir --

28:50.854 --> 28:53.232
This isn't a game.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.279
They may be bandits,
but they ride 40 strong.

28:59.488 --> 29:03.158
Two or three samurai
won't suffice.

29:16.839 --> 29:20.009
Defense is more difficult
than offense.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.263
You say there are mountains
behind the village?

29:24.471 --> 29:25.264
Yes.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.141
Passable by horse?

29:27.349 --> 29:28.350
Yes.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.820
Fields in front.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.489
Until those are flooded
with water,

29:42.865 --> 29:45.909
you're open to mounted attack
on four sides.

29:47.369 --> 29:50.080
You need at least four men,
one to guard each side.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.209
Two more to guard the rear.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.547
No matter how frugal
our estimate,

29:59.423 --> 30:01.759
we need seven,
including me.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.263
We can manage
seven somehow.

30:06.472 --> 30:09.183
But the Old Man said four.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.018
It's only three more.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.103
Hold on a second.

30:13.312 --> 30:17.024
I haven't accepted your offer.
I'm only speculating.

30:18.067 --> 30:22.905
First of all, it's not easy
to find trustworthy samurai.

30:23.322 --> 30:28.285
What's more,
all you have to offer is food.

30:29.662 --> 30:33.082
Only those out to fight
for the hell of it will agree.

30:33.499 --> 30:37.795
Besides, I'm sick of fighting.

30:39.296 --> 30:40.923
Age, I suppose.

31:02.277 --> 31:05.364
Good thing
I wasn't born a peasant.

31:07.157 --> 31:10.619
Better to be born a dog.
Goddamn it.

31:10.953 --> 31:14.873
Go ahead -- hang yourself and die!
You're better off dead!

31:15.082 --> 31:16.458
Silence, you lout!

31:16.667 --> 31:19.253
What's it to you?
I'm only telling the truth.

31:19.461 --> 31:23.716
What truth? What the hell do you know
of these farmers' suffering?

31:23.924 --> 31:25.509
Don't make me laugh!

31:25.718 --> 31:27.386
Like you would know.

31:27.594 --> 31:28.429
How dare you?

31:28.637 --> 31:32.016
You heard right. If you know,
why don't you help them?

31:37.563 --> 31:39.148
So you wanna fight?

31:41.608 --> 31:42.943
That's enough.

31:49.283 --> 31:51.118
Enough!

31:58.459 --> 32:01.712
Hey, samurai, look at this.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.756
This here's your dinner.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.592
But what do you think
these blockheads eat?

32:06.800 --> 32:08.052
Millet.

32:08.302 --> 32:12.306
They eat millet
to feed you white rice.

32:12.514 --> 32:16.018
This is the best they can offer.
What do you say to that?

32:17.811 --> 32:19.730
- All right, then.
- What?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.357
Quit your jabbering.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.448
I won't let this rice go to waste.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.509
Manzo and the others are back!

33:03.148 --> 33:04.692
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

33:04.900 --> 33:07.569
They stayed behind.
We still need more samurai.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.029
The samurai are coming?

33:09.238 --> 33:11.281
They sure are.
Seven of 'em.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.700
Seven?

33:16.787 --> 33:18.247
Seven.

33:18.872 --> 33:23.043
I was against it
because you said four, Old Man.

33:24.712 --> 33:29.883
I figured we'd need
at least ten.

33:30.092 --> 33:35.180
But if I'd said ten,
we'd have ended up with 15.

33:36.098 --> 33:38.726
That's the way it goes.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.272
Old Man, I'm worried.

33:47.985 --> 33:51.572
The village girls will go crazy
over the samurai.

33:51.780 --> 33:55.951
If the samurai touch 'em,
all hell will break loose.

33:59.455 --> 34:02.458
Bandits are coming, you fool.

34:03.625 --> 34:06.086
Your head is on the block,

34:06.462 --> 34:09.715
and all you think of
are your whiskers?

34:19.350 --> 34:20.516
Samurai, sir.

34:31.362 --> 34:34.989
- You require my services?
- Yes, sir.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.201
Who's to be my opponent?

34:38.409 --> 34:40.120
<i>Katsushiro. </i>

34:52.174 --> 34:53.967
Hide just inside the door.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.889
Strike that ronin as he enters.

35:03.686 --> 35:05.396
Here he comes.

35:10.192 --> 35:13.237
Don't hold back.
Give him a real whack.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.851
Excellent!

35:44.810 --> 35:48.856
Please don't take offense.
I am Kambei Shimada.

35:49.064 --> 35:53.527
We're seeking expert swordsmen
and have no time to waste.

35:53.736 --> 35:55.029
Forgive me.

35:55.738 --> 35:56.947
What's this about?

35:57.865 --> 35:59.950
The reason better be good,
or I'll have to redeem my honor.

36:00.159 --> 36:04.621
I humbly beg your pardon.
We only sought to test your skill.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.125
We must soon contend
with a gang of bandits.

36:09.043 --> 36:11.962
I see.
And whose clan do you serve?

36:12.171 --> 36:17.551
It pains me to tell you,
but we're fighting for farmers.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.261
- Farmers?
- That's right.

36:19.470 --> 36:22.890
This job affords
no stipend and no reward.

36:23.599 --> 36:27.144
But we can eat our fill
as long as we fight.

36:27.436 --> 36:28.812
This is absurd!

36:29.813 --> 36:31.940
My ambitions
are greater than that.

36:33.609 --> 36:37.905
That's a shame.
Won't you reconsider?

36:38.781 --> 36:40.157
I will not.

36:46.497 --> 36:51.543
Sir, we lost a good man there.
Such a fine swordsman.

37:37.673 --> 37:39.299
What's wrong?

37:39.508 --> 37:43.887
That one samurai's good,
but how'll the other six be?

37:44.096 --> 37:46.181
Enough of your worrying.

37:46.390 --> 37:50.978
How can we know before they get here?
Don't worry till you've seen 'em.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.203
<i>That one there. </i>

38:26.513 --> 38:28.891
Excuse me, samurai, sir.

38:31.060 --> 38:32.936
Just like last time?

38:36.273 --> 38:39.360
Sure.
It's good practice for you.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.435
Surely you jest.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.063
No offense intended.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.830
I'm with you.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.501
But I have to say

39:38.043 --> 39:40.754
that although I understand
the farmers' suffering

39:41.130 --> 39:45.634
and understand
why you would take up their cause,

39:45.843 --> 39:50.723
it's your character
that I find most compelling.

39:51.640 --> 39:56.270
In life one finds friends
in the strangest places.

40:02.276 --> 40:04.862
- What is your name?
- Gorobei Katayama.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.031
A name fit for a giant, no?

40:18.042 --> 40:21.503
Yohei, what are you doing?
Hurry and wash the rice.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.468
Yohei!

40:31.347 --> 40:32.556
What's wrong?

40:34.350 --> 40:37.311
Someone stole the rice.

40:48.530 --> 40:51.659
You idiot!
Didn't I warn you?

40:51.867 --> 40:54.620
I was so careful.

40:59.333 --> 41:03.837
I slept the whole night
hugging that rice jar.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.928
Fine, then!
I'll get more from home!

41:12.262 --> 41:13.722
But what'll we do

41:13.931 --> 41:16.141
till you get back?

41:16.350 --> 41:20.604
There's only a handful left.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.950
Stop that, you idiot!

42:15.159 --> 42:17.911
Hide that money.
The master's returning.

42:23.375 --> 42:26.128
I ran into you
at just the right time.

42:29.006 --> 42:35.054
So you're still alive.
I figured you'd long since left this earth.

42:41.643 --> 42:44.396
Now tell me,
what happened after that?

42:44.980 --> 42:48.108
I hid among the grasses
in the moat until dark.

42:50.611 --> 42:56.450
When the outer walls tumbled down
on me in flames, I knew I was finished.

42:57.493 --> 42:59.912
What ran through your mind
at that moment?

43:00.829 --> 43:03.791
Nothing special.

43:06.168 --> 43:08.921
Sick of fighting yet?

43:17.763 --> 43:23.977
Truth is, there's a tough battle ahead
leading to neither money nor rank.

43:24.186 --> 43:26.563
Will you join us?
- Yes.

43:27.398 --> 43:29.608
This may be the one
that kills us.

43:50.671 --> 43:52.506
Where are they
when you need 'em?

43:52.715 --> 43:54.800
What do you need, sir?

43:55.009 --> 43:57.177
Samurai.

43:59.221 --> 44:03.392
There's a pretty poor excuse for one
in my backyard.

44:03.600 --> 44:07.187
I couldn't believe his gumption.

44:07.396 --> 44:10.149
He says,
"I'm hungry. Feed me.

44:10.357 --> 44:14.403
I'm broke, though,
so I'll pay you by chopping wood."

44:19.825 --> 44:23.162
I like his frankness.

45:02.868 --> 45:05.788
Never seen a man
split wood before?

45:05.996 --> 45:08.457
Sure, but you do it
with such relish.

45:08.666 --> 45:12.586
It's just my nature.
Sorry if it bothers you.

45:17.383 --> 45:18.676
You're very good.

45:18.884 --> 45:22.221
It's nothing compared
to how I cut down men.

45:22.429 --> 45:25.891
- Have you cut down many?
- That I have.

45:26.141 --> 45:28.811
There's no cutting me off
when I start cutting.

45:32.147 --> 45:35.484
So I make it a point
to run away first.

45:36.443 --> 45:39.071
A most excellent approach.

45:39.279 --> 45:41.448
Why, thank you kindly.

45:48.664 --> 45:53.502
Tell me, do you feel like
cutting down 30 bandits?

46:12.521 --> 46:14.106
Let us commence!

47:45.114 --> 47:46.323
Too bad.

47:46.532 --> 47:47.783
It's a draw.

47:47.992 --> 47:49.493
I'm afraid not.

47:49.702 --> 47:50.953
I won.

47:54.623 --> 47:55.708
That's ridiculous!

47:57.584 --> 48:00.212
If these were steel,
you'd be dead now.

48:05.300 --> 48:07.469
- Then we fight with steel!
- Don't throw your life away.

48:07.678 --> 48:08.387
What?

48:08.595 --> 48:11.890
Don't you see?
With steel blades, you'd die.

48:12.099 --> 48:13.517
It's a waste of your life.

48:13.726 --> 48:16.145
Wait! Don't try to flee.

48:19.773 --> 48:22.735
Draw! This isn't
a contest of words!

49:01.190 --> 49:02.858
This is preposterous.

49:04.109 --> 49:06.153
There's no contest.

49:37.976 --> 49:39.687
How did you fare?

49:43.565 --> 49:46.694
We let a good fish get away.
An excellent swordsman.

49:48.070 --> 49:50.239
They say the fish that gets away
looks bigger than it really is.

49:50.447 --> 49:51.657
No.

49:52.741 --> 49:56.245
I watched him cut a man down
with my own eyes.

50:03.252 --> 50:04.920
It was amazing.

50:05.254 --> 50:09.341
A man obsessed only
with testing the limits of his skill.

50:09.925 --> 50:11.969
I doubt he'll join us.

50:12.177 --> 50:14.555
- That's a shame.
- Indeed.

50:15.973 --> 50:18.726
I did tell him
where we're staying, though.

50:19.059 --> 50:20.978
And how did you fare?

50:21.562 --> 50:23.355
- Caught one.
- I see.

50:23.564 --> 50:26.984
- As a swordsman, barely mediocre.
- Barely mediocre?

50:28.485 --> 50:31.405
But an honest, amusing man.

50:31.613 --> 50:34.366
Something about him
brightens one's spirits.

50:34.700 --> 50:37.244
He'll be a treasure in hard times.

50:37.661 --> 50:38.996
Much obliged.

50:41.123 --> 50:45.961
Actually, I did land one myself.
- The one dressed as a peddler?

50:46.170 --> 50:47.254
That's right.

50:47.463 --> 50:50.090
In fact, he's an old trusted friend.

50:56.055 --> 50:57.931
I'll bring some water.

51:01.643 --> 51:03.729
I'm Heihachi Hayashida.

51:03.937 --> 51:06.899
A modest warrior
of the Wood-Chop School.

51:12.821 --> 51:15.741
Just three more to go.

51:15.949 --> 51:18.285
Three? Don't you mean two?

51:18.494 --> 51:20.913
No, we can't afford
to take a child along.

51:22.456 --> 51:23.374
Master!

51:23.791 --> 51:25.542
I know, I know.

51:26.001 --> 51:28.337
I know what you'll say.

51:28.545 --> 51:32.716
I was once your age, you know.

51:33.884 --> 51:35.844
Hone your skills,

51:36.095 --> 51:39.306
then go to war
and do great things.

51:39.723 --> 51:43.560
Then become lord
of your own castle and domain.

51:44.520 --> 51:49.817
But as you dream those dreams,
before you know it,

51:50.025 --> 51:52.152
your hair will turn
as gray as mine.

51:53.862 --> 51:57.866
By that time

51:58.075 --> 52:01.537
you've lost your parents
and you're all alone.

52:49.626 --> 52:51.712
Tomorrow you go home.

52:52.129 --> 52:54.631
You've learned a lot
these four or five days.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.759
You have
fine stories to tell.

53:12.608 --> 53:16.362
Please, sir.
I beg you to let him come along.

53:16.570 --> 53:19.531
Why not let him come?
You call him a kid, but --

53:19.740 --> 53:21.075
Actually,

53:21.283 --> 53:23.494
kids work harder than adults.

53:24.453 --> 53:28.082
But only if you treat them
like adults.

53:28.749 --> 53:32.127
Then let's treat him
like an adult.

53:37.841 --> 53:40.302
That means only two more.

53:40.511 --> 53:43.681
Actually just one, it seems.

53:50.145 --> 53:52.272
You wish to join us?

53:53.482 --> 53:55.442
I'm very grateful.

53:55.651 --> 53:57.653
- When do we depart?
- Tomorrow.

54:01.490 --> 54:02.491
Tomorrow?

54:04.326 --> 54:08.205
This is enough. We don't have time
to find the last one.

54:10.958 --> 54:12.626
All right, then.

54:16.046 --> 54:17.589
Master!

54:18.507 --> 54:20.217
Master!
- All right.

54:21.301 --> 54:24.471
- Master!
- All right! That's enough of that!

54:29.309 --> 54:32.146
Hey, I just found
a real tough samurai.

54:32.354 --> 54:34.690
There was a huge fight.
They were no match for him.

54:34.898 --> 54:37.484
Never seen anything like it.
He's like a wild dog.

54:37.693 --> 54:40.654
Someone stopped the fight.
They started drinking.

54:40.863 --> 54:42.489
I told him about you.

54:42.698 --> 54:44.450
He's on his way.

54:46.869 --> 54:48.829
Shall we give him the usual?

55:02.843 --> 55:04.553
What are you doing?

55:05.012 --> 55:06.680
Testing him.

55:08.140 --> 55:09.683
That's a dirty trick!

55:09.892 --> 55:12.353
Hey, samurai!
- Just shut up and watch.

55:12.561 --> 55:14.563
A true samurai won't get hit.

55:14.772 --> 55:16.440
But this guy's drunk!

55:16.649 --> 55:19.485
A samurai never drinks
enough to dull his wits.

55:34.625 --> 55:36.919
I told you!
You guys are nuts.

55:38.128 --> 55:39.838
What the --

55:43.759 --> 55:46.553
Who the hell hit me?

56:02.277 --> 56:03.904
You?

56:08.951 --> 56:12.246
Who hit me?

56:18.085 --> 56:19.545
You?

56:22.089 --> 56:24.258
Damn bastard!

56:52.786 --> 56:54.663
You again!

56:57.291 --> 57:00.711
I see that bald head of yours
in my dreams!

57:03.297 --> 57:05.215
Hey, you.

57:06.133 --> 57:08.969
How dare you even ask me
if I'm a samurai!

57:09.553 --> 57:11.555
You got some nerve!

57:13.474 --> 57:15.267
Don't mess with me.

57:22.149 --> 57:25.569
I may look like hell,
but I'm a real samurai!

57:29.114 --> 57:33.535
I've been looking for you
ever since that day.

57:34.745 --> 57:36.830
Wanted you to see this.

57:45.297 --> 57:46.840
Look at this!

57:47.049 --> 57:52.054
This is my family tree.
All my ancestors are here.

57:53.972 --> 57:58.227
Damn you, trying to make
a fool outta me. Screw you.

58:00.145 --> 58:01.438
Looky here.

58:03.065 --> 58:04.858
Making a fool outta me.

58:11.532 --> 58:13.784
My honorable self
is right here.

58:14.743 --> 58:17.204
So this Kikuchiyo here
would be you?

58:17.413 --> 58:19.206
That is correct.

58:19.581 --> 58:23.752
"Kikuchiyo,
born February 17, 1574."

58:25.796 --> 58:27.923
What's so damned funny?

58:29.466 --> 58:32.177
You hardly look
13 years old to me.

58:33.095 --> 58:37.057
If you are in fact
the Kikuchiyo listed here,

58:37.266 --> 58:40.102
you'd now be precisely
13 years old.

58:44.606 --> 58:47.359
Where'd you steal
this family tree?

58:47.943 --> 58:51.322
Steal it? Shit!

58:51.947 --> 58:53.949
Damn jerks.

58:54.116 --> 58:56.160
To hell with samurai.

58:57.661 --> 58:59.788
To hell with samurai!

59:02.666 --> 59:05.044
Hey, you bastard!

59:06.503 --> 59:09.173
Come back here!

59:09.381 --> 59:12.593
Goddamn it,
you son of a bitch!

59:22.811 --> 59:26.106
What's wrong, teenager?
Here you are.

59:28.359 --> 59:30.486
Damn you!

59:32.154 --> 59:34.073
Come back here!

01:00:09.108 --> 01:00:11.068
What's wrong, Lord Kikuchiyo?

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:17.950
What's the matter, junior?

01:00:27.584 --> 01:00:30.170
Screw samurai!

01:00:46.729 --> 01:00:50.399
- Is he really a samurai?
- In his own mind, anyway.

01:01:01.535 --> 01:01:03.454
<i>Take me too!</i>

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:10.794
Hey, Kikuchiyo.

01:01:13.464 --> 01:01:15.341
Guard your treasure.

01:01:17.217 --> 01:01:20.179
Let me go too!

01:02:00.803 --> 01:02:02.930
What is it, Father?

01:02:19.488 --> 01:02:21.281
What is it?

01:02:22.157 --> 01:02:24.326
What are you staring at?

01:02:32.501 --> 01:02:36.088
Shino, cut off your hair.

01:02:36.296 --> 01:02:38.882
Cut your hair
and dress like a man.

01:02:41.051 --> 01:02:43.554
- What are you talking about?
- Just cut it off!

01:02:44.555 --> 01:02:48.475
It's only because I love you.
No telling what those samurai'll do!

01:02:48.684 --> 01:02:49.601
No!

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:52.187
No, I won't!

01:02:56.525 --> 01:02:58.027
Shino!

01:03:22.885 --> 01:03:24.219
He's a fool.

01:03:24.428 --> 01:03:27.890
But Manzo knows those samurai
better than anyone.

01:03:28.057 --> 01:03:30.184
If he cut off his daughter's hair,
he must have good reason.

01:03:30.392 --> 01:03:33.520
You've only got sons,
so you're safe, but we --

01:03:33.729 --> 01:03:36.231
Goddamn it!
Now I understand.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.319
So you agree to hide my daughter
at your place across the bridge?

01:03:40.527 --> 01:03:43.447
Idiot! I meant that I see
what Manzo's up to.

01:03:44.198 --> 01:03:49.870
That rascal doesn't care about the village,
only about his daughter.

01:03:50.245 --> 01:03:51.622
Damn him!

01:04:10.724 --> 01:04:12.893
Look what you've done!

01:04:13.394 --> 01:04:15.437
Now the whole village is crazed.

01:04:15.646 --> 01:04:17.898
Every family
with a girl's gone mad.

01:04:19.692 --> 01:04:21.735
How do you plan
to set this right?

01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:24.738
The samurai will show up
any day now.

01:04:25.614 --> 01:04:28.575
Come on.
We're seeing the Old Man.

01:04:30.619 --> 01:04:33.664
There's nothing to see here!
Go home!

01:04:34.957 --> 01:04:36.333
Go home!

01:04:38.127 --> 01:04:41.672
We can't let the samurai
see us like this.

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:50.431
He's still following us.

01:06:35.744 --> 01:06:37.788
Where did Kikuchiyo go?

01:06:38.747 --> 01:06:40.457
Think he gave up?

01:06:40.708 --> 01:06:42.459
It's funny.

01:06:42.751 --> 01:06:44.878
Now that he's gone,
it's almost a little...

01:06:45.254 --> 01:06:47.047
Lonely.

01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:54.555
This way.

01:06:56.974 --> 01:06:58.851
Oh, hell!

01:07:11.822 --> 01:07:14.366
So that's our castle, eh?

01:07:15.451 --> 01:07:18.203
No way I'm gonna die
in that dungheap.

01:07:18.412 --> 01:07:20.914
No one asked you to.

01:07:39.308 --> 01:07:43.228
We're back!
The samurai have arrived!

01:07:48.275 --> 01:07:50.235
The samurai are here!

01:07:54.948 --> 01:07:58.619
What's wrong with you?
The samurai are here!

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.752
Hey, what's wrong?

01:08:10.839 --> 01:08:12.633
What's the matter?

01:08:26.647 --> 01:08:28.983
This is a fine welcome.

01:08:32.611 --> 01:08:34.654
What's the meaning of this?

01:08:37.573 --> 01:08:41.495
Hey, what's going on?
The samurai have arrived!

01:08:57.636 --> 01:08:59.971
- We'll go see the Old Man.
- The Old Man?

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.142
Whatever happens in the village,
the Old Man --

01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:05.352
He's the village elder?

01:09:06.895 --> 01:09:11.358
An audience with the village elder.
This is truly an honor.

01:09:15.237 --> 01:09:16.863
Well, let's go.

01:10:28.894 --> 01:10:34.274
I know they're being foolish.

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:38.529
All farmers ever do is worry,

01:10:38.737 --> 01:10:43.575
whether the rain falls,
the sun shines, or the wind blows.

01:10:43.909 --> 01:10:45.953
In short,

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:50.124
all they know is fear.

01:10:50.499 --> 01:10:54.169
Their behavior today...

01:10:55.796 --> 01:10:59.299
is also due simply to fear.

01:11:02.052 --> 01:11:07.099
But Old Man,
why do the villagers fear us?

01:11:08.017 --> 01:11:11.812
What can they expect from us
under such circumstances?

01:11:42.551 --> 01:11:44.261
Samurai, sirs!

01:11:44.928 --> 01:11:47.473
Samurai, please!

01:12:04.406 --> 01:12:07.618
Quiet down!

01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:10.913
Don't panic. Calm down.

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:14.333
I want clear answers.

01:12:14.541 --> 01:12:16.835
Where are the bandits
coming from?

01:12:17.044 --> 01:12:20.297
- The mountains!
- No, the road!

01:12:23.592 --> 01:12:26.720
Who saw the bandits?
Come forward.

01:12:27.012 --> 01:12:29.223
No one saw any bandits?

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:31.934
Then who sounded the alarm?

01:12:32.142 --> 01:12:33.394
<i>I did!</i>

01:12:39.942 --> 01:12:42.236
Outta the way.

01:12:46.865 --> 01:12:49.368
What's with the faces?

01:12:50.661 --> 01:12:53.706
Don't worry.
No bandits have come.

01:12:59.044 --> 01:13:00.754
Hey, blockheads.

01:13:00.963 --> 01:13:04.633
Remember how you welcomed us
when we got here?

01:13:04.967 --> 01:13:07.636
But as soon as I bang on this,

01:13:07.845 --> 01:13:11.223
"Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!"

01:13:11.682 --> 01:13:13.934
You're practically groveling!

01:13:18.814 --> 01:13:21.442
Got what you deserved,
you mud snails.

01:13:39.209 --> 01:13:41.754
Got a problem, gramps?

01:13:41.962 --> 01:13:43.255
Nope.

01:13:43.672 --> 01:13:45.758
All's well now.

01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:54.099
Looks like he's good
for something after all.

01:13:54.308 --> 01:13:56.894
There are seven of us at last.

01:14:04.109 --> 01:14:06.070
Sorry it's so dirty.

01:14:06.278 --> 01:14:10.115
But where will you sleep
if we take your home?

01:14:10.407 --> 01:14:13.827
- In the barn.
- With your horse?

01:14:15.371 --> 01:14:18.290
The bandits
got my horse last year.

01:14:35.641 --> 01:14:39.228
A barn's not so bad
with a wife to snuggle up to.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.693
I don't have a wife!

01:14:45.901 --> 01:14:47.611
What's the matter, you fool?

01:14:59.248 --> 01:15:00.708
Jerk.

01:15:14.263 --> 01:15:16.932
By the way,
what's your real name?

01:15:18.851 --> 01:15:20.686
I don't remember.

01:15:21.103 --> 01:15:23.439
Give me a new one that fits.

01:15:23.939 --> 01:15:26.108
Then Kikuchiyo it is.

01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:29.445
Fits you perfectly.

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.328
How would you attack
this village?

01:15:54.536 --> 01:15:57.122
I'd charge from this mountain.

01:15:58.749 --> 01:16:00.834
I agree.
Along this road.

01:16:01.418 --> 01:16:03.587
WEST

01:16:18.644 --> 01:16:21.438
And what's the best defense?

01:16:21.772 --> 01:16:23.816
Shichiroji knows what to do.

01:16:24.567 --> 01:16:27.945
See these logs?
He'll make a fence to block the horses.

01:16:28.153 --> 01:16:30.614
Indeed.
Your trusty right-hand man.

01:16:59.602 --> 01:17:00.895
All right!

01:17:01.562 --> 01:17:03.105
Listen.

01:17:04.231 --> 01:17:06.233
Nothing forces you to run
like a battle.

01:17:06.775 --> 01:17:09.612
You run when you attack,
you run when you retreat.

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.156
When you can't run anymore,
you die.

01:17:30.674 --> 01:17:33.177
SOUTH

01:17:46.523 --> 01:17:50.194
We'll flood these fields
after they harvest the barley.

01:17:50.486 --> 01:17:55.074
That'll make a good defense.
But will we have time?

01:17:55.282 --> 01:17:56.575
Indeed.

01:18:04.166 --> 01:18:05.626
Charge!

01:18:06.627 --> 01:18:10.756
Pretend I'm a bandit
and stab me.

01:18:13.759 --> 01:18:15.386
Charge!

01:18:18.597 --> 01:18:20.266
Come on!

01:18:29.275 --> 01:18:30.693
<i>Next. </i>

01:18:32.444 --> 01:18:33.946
<i>Next. </i>

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.323
What's wrong with all of you?

01:19:00.431 --> 01:19:03.559
EAST

01:19:07.104 --> 01:19:11.650
Destroying this bridge
will foil an assault from the east.

01:19:18.741 --> 01:19:21.869
But what about the houses
on the other side?

01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:31.795
They'll have to evacuate those.

01:19:36.175 --> 01:19:38.260
And the mill?

01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:43.390
The Old Man's
not going to go quietly.

01:19:49.605 --> 01:19:52.441
Listen now.
The enemy is scary.

01:19:53.067 --> 01:19:54.526
Everybody's scared.

01:19:54.777 --> 01:19:58.197
But the other side's
scared of us too.

01:20:27.601 --> 01:20:29.270
Just great.

01:20:30.271 --> 01:20:32.940
You all make great scarecrows.

01:20:35.359 --> 01:20:39.238
Problem is, the enemy
isn't a bunch of sparrows and crows!

01:20:47.705 --> 01:20:51.375
You there, chewing your cud.
Can you cut that out?

01:20:55.504 --> 01:20:57.548
This isn't a cow shed!

01:21:00.885 --> 01:21:03.262
Look at the bunch of you.

01:21:06.223 --> 01:21:07.808
Shit!

01:21:08.017 --> 01:21:10.728
First in line, step forward!

01:21:13.105 --> 01:21:15.107
I'm talking to you!

01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:16.901
You!

01:21:37.171 --> 01:21:40.424
<i>Look here! You gotta pay
a mon each to watch the show!</i>

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.070
What's this?

01:22:02.071 --> 01:22:05.032
- A spear, sir.
- Idiot.

01:22:05.241 --> 01:22:07.952
Where the hell
did you get it?

01:22:08.869 --> 01:22:11.372
Did it sprout up in those hills?

01:22:13.749 --> 01:22:15.209
I know perfectly well.

01:22:15.417 --> 01:22:17.878
You hunted down retreating warriors
and took their weapons.

01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:21.882
If you've got one,
you must have more.

01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:26.387
Fess up, damn it!

01:22:35.187 --> 01:22:37.648
NORTH

01:22:47.074 --> 01:22:51.287
What a peaceful grove.
But it's also a death trap.

01:23:27.156 --> 01:23:28.616
Katsushiro.

01:23:29.033 --> 01:23:31.243
We're going.
- I'll be right there.

01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:41.128
As I said,
he's still a child.

01:24:42.731 --> 01:24:45.526
Are you from the village?

01:24:50.072 --> 01:24:51.448
Are you a girl?

01:24:55.202 --> 01:24:57.413
A boy?

01:24:58.247 --> 01:25:01.208
Then where's your spear?

01:25:01.417 --> 01:25:04.837
Is this any time for an able-bodied man
to be picking flowers?

01:25:05.713 --> 01:25:08.007
Come here!
I'll teach you.

01:25:08.465 --> 01:25:10.009
Come here!

01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:16.056
Why, you!

01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:23.791
This is fine, and this too.

01:26:23.958 --> 01:26:25.876
But this is a problem.

01:26:26.418 --> 01:26:28.921
<i>Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

01:26:31.799 --> 01:26:34.218
Get back, the rest of you!

01:26:34.843 --> 01:26:37.346
Stand up straight!

01:26:42.685 --> 01:26:44.478
What a haul!

01:26:50.985 --> 01:26:52.278
What's all this?

01:26:52.486 --> 01:26:54.822
Plunder from defeated warriors.

01:26:56.490 --> 01:26:58.325
Where did you find it?

01:26:58.534 --> 01:27:01.537
Here in the village?
- Yep, over at Manzo's.

01:27:11.130 --> 01:27:12.840
What's the matter?

01:27:14.925 --> 01:27:16.677
Don't you like 'em?

01:27:18.846 --> 01:27:21.348
This is good stuff.

01:27:22.975 --> 01:27:24.518
What's wrong?

01:27:24.727 --> 01:27:28.147
You said you wanted armor,
spears and bows. Now you got 'em.

01:27:28.355 --> 01:27:30.774
Bastard!
You call yourself a samurai?

01:27:32.067 --> 01:27:35.029
Those farmers killed samurai
to get these.

01:27:35.237 --> 01:27:37.197
- I know that.
- Then why the hell --

01:27:37.406 --> 01:27:39.241
That's enough!

01:27:40.576 --> 01:27:44.205
You can't understand
unless you've been hunted.

01:27:57.051 --> 01:27:59.762
It's nothing.
Get outta here.

01:28:23.077 --> 01:28:27.957
Now I want to kill them all.

01:28:41.845 --> 01:28:43.764
Well, that's just fine and dandy!

01:28:46.267 --> 01:28:50.729
What did ya think
these farmers were anyway?

01:28:50.938 --> 01:28:53.440
Buddhas or something?

01:28:53.983 --> 01:28:55.568
Don't make me laugh!

01:28:55.818 --> 01:28:58.237
There's no creature on earth
as wily as a farmer!

01:29:04.118 --> 01:29:06.954
Ask 'em for rice, barley,
anything,

01:29:07.121 --> 01:29:09.498
and all they ever say is,
"We're all out."

01:29:10.916 --> 01:29:15.212
But they've got it.
They've got everything.

01:29:16.130 --> 01:29:20.134
Dig under the floorboards.
If it's not there, try the barn.

01:29:20.342 --> 01:29:25.806
You'll find plenty.
Jars of rice, salt, beans, sake!

01:29:30.853 --> 01:29:34.023
Go up in the mountains.
They have hidden fields.

01:29:34.607 --> 01:29:37.234
They kowtow and lie,
playing innocent the whole time.

01:29:37.443 --> 01:29:39.820
You name it,
they'll cheat you on it!

01:29:40.029 --> 01:29:43.073
After a battle, they hunt down
the losers with their spears.

01:29:45.492 --> 01:29:46.619
Listen to me!

01:29:46.827 --> 01:29:50.331
Farmers are misers, weasels,

01:29:50.539 --> 01:29:51.790
and crybabies!

01:29:51.999 --> 01:29:54.335
They're mean, stupid

01:29:54.543 --> 01:29:56.337
murderers!

01:29:56.545 --> 01:29:59.632
Damn!
I could laugh till I cry!

01:30:03.344 --> 01:30:07.139
But tell me this:
Who turned them into such monsters?

01:30:07.389 --> 01:30:10.809
You did!
You samurai did!

01:30:11.227 --> 01:30:13.020
Damn you to hell!

01:30:19.944 --> 01:30:21.737
In war, you burn their villages,

01:30:21.946 --> 01:30:25.032
trample their fields,
steal their food,

01:30:25.866 --> 01:30:28.869
work them like slaves,
rape their women,

01:30:29.078 --> 01:30:30.704
and kill 'em if they resist.

01:30:30.913 --> 01:30:32.790
What do you expect 'em to do?

01:30:32.998 --> 01:30:35.292
What the hell are farmers
supposed to do?

01:30:35.501 --> 01:30:37.962
Damn it! Goddamn it!

01:31:15.749 --> 01:31:19.378
You were born a farmer,
weren't you?

01:31:56.957 --> 01:32:00.252
What is it now?

01:32:00.461 --> 01:32:04.381
Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.

01:33:10.072 --> 01:33:11.615
It's me.

01:33:11.866 --> 01:33:13.909
I'm sleeping here
from now on.

01:33:14.577 --> 01:33:16.871
Those guys cramp my style.

01:33:18.706 --> 01:33:21.750
Idiot! Stop cowering!

01:33:22.418 --> 01:33:24.461
This is your place!

01:33:25.004 --> 01:33:27.798
You hand over your house
and sleep in a barn,

01:33:28.007 --> 01:33:29.800
and still you can't stand up
for yourself.

01:33:30.009 --> 01:33:31.510
Get to sleep!

01:33:48.152 --> 01:33:50.070
Brings back memories.

01:34:08.464 --> 01:34:10.424
Sure is quiet.

01:34:13.344 --> 01:34:18.641
On a day like this, it's hard
to imagine bandits on that mountain.

01:34:20.601 --> 01:34:23.687
Damn it all,
I need a girl!

01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:33.989
- Where are you going?
- The hills.

01:34:34.198 --> 01:34:36.242
- The hills?
- To practice.

01:34:37.952 --> 01:34:39.537
No girls up there.

01:34:41.247 --> 01:34:43.958
Sometimes you really
hit the nail on the head.

01:34:45.125 --> 01:34:47.419
What are you making there?

01:34:47.628 --> 01:34:49.547
- A flag.
- A flag?

01:34:50.297 --> 01:34:55.928
It doesn't feel right in battle
without a banner to raise high.

01:35:00.766 --> 01:35:02.476
What do the symbols mean?

01:35:02.643 --> 01:35:07.481
This represents a field:
That is, the farmers and this village.

01:35:08.399 --> 01:35:10.776
- And those circles?
- Those are us.

01:35:11.735 --> 01:35:14.321
There's only six.
You leaving me out?

01:35:14.530 --> 01:35:17.616
No, this triangle's Lord Kikuchiyo.

01:35:17.825 --> 01:35:19.702
That's a good one!

01:36:40.908 --> 01:36:42.618
It's real rice.

01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:44.828
Go ahead. Eat.
- But --

01:36:45.037 --> 01:36:47.206
Rikichi gave me some millet.

01:36:47.414 --> 01:36:51.710
I could barely get it down.

01:36:53.754 --> 01:36:55.506
Go ahead. Eat.

01:37:06.850 --> 01:37:08.269
Hurry up and eat.

01:37:08.435 --> 01:37:10.312
If you're embarrassed, I'll go.

01:37:10.521 --> 01:37:12.356
I'm not going to eat it.

01:37:12.606 --> 01:37:14.775
Why not?
I went to a lot of trouble.

01:37:14.984 --> 01:37:16.902
No, I just --

01:37:18.153 --> 01:37:23.450
I know you did, so I'll take it
to Kyuemon's grandma.

01:37:23.659 --> 01:37:26.412
Kyuemon's grandma?

01:37:47.099 --> 01:37:51.353
Rikichi, I'm full.
I'll save the rest for later.

01:37:52.104 --> 01:37:54.481
Go ahead and eat.

01:37:54.732 --> 01:37:56.692
Take my leftovers this time.

01:37:57.693 --> 01:38:01.280
What's this?
What are you up to?

01:38:01.488 --> 01:38:02.990
What's going on?

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.833
How terrible.

01:38:14.335 --> 01:38:18.422
Doesn't she have family?
- The bandits got them all.

01:38:24.887 --> 01:38:26.347
I...

01:38:27.223 --> 01:38:32.019
want to die quickly.

01:38:32.186 --> 01:38:36.440
I want to die soon

01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:40.861
and leave this suffering behind.

01:38:42.488 --> 01:38:44.865
But you know...

01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:49.828
the other world may be

01:38:50.037 --> 01:38:54.166
just as full of suffering
as this one.

01:38:56.001 --> 01:38:57.753
It's not.

01:38:57.962 --> 01:39:02.299
In that world
there's no war and no bandits.

01:39:02.675 --> 01:39:04.843
There's no suffering there,
grandma.

01:39:05.052 --> 01:39:08.639
How the hell would you know?
Have you been there?

01:39:08.847 --> 01:39:10.558
Why the hell
are you always screaming?

01:39:10.766 --> 01:39:12.476
I hate wimps.

01:39:12.685 --> 01:39:15.312
Worms like her make me sick!

01:39:17.898 --> 01:39:19.984
Pissing and grumbling
about everything.

01:39:21.443 --> 01:39:24.446
Shit!
I want to do something wild!

01:39:24.697 --> 01:39:28.576
Save your spit and fire
for the bandits.

01:39:44.341 --> 01:39:46.135
Excuse me.

01:39:48.095 --> 01:39:51.223
Excuse me, but why did you --

01:39:51.515 --> 01:39:54.226
You saw us today, didn't you?

01:39:54.435 --> 01:39:56.896
Me and the --

01:39:57.104 --> 01:39:59.064
- The girl?
- Yes.

01:40:00.065 --> 01:40:03.819
Why didn't you --
- Tell them? You want me to?

01:40:19.001 --> 01:40:23.464
We want rice!
White rice!

01:40:28.219 --> 01:40:31.805
You little brats!
There's no rice!

01:40:37.561 --> 01:40:39.563
Quit yapping!

01:40:39.772 --> 01:40:44.735
If you've got the strength
to scream, "We want rice!"

01:40:44.944 --> 01:40:47.321
Then you don't need it!

01:40:47.738 --> 01:40:50.574
Listen here,
you little piss pants.

01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:54.828
This is all the rice there is.

01:40:55.037 --> 01:40:58.249
If we give you any more,
we'll get all --

01:41:01.961 --> 01:41:03.420
That's how it is.

01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:07.383
Say, any of you got
a pretty sister?

01:41:09.843 --> 01:41:13.556
How about you?
You got one?

01:41:13.806 --> 01:41:17.351
So, Old Man,
when is the harvest?

01:41:19.728 --> 01:41:21.522
In ten days.

01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:24.024
How quickly can you do it?

01:41:26.026 --> 01:41:28.904
No less than three days.

01:41:29.947 --> 01:41:31.991
We'll flood the fields
when you're done.

01:41:32.199 --> 01:41:36.036
You see, we want to create
a moat to the south of the village.

01:41:36.203 --> 01:41:38.330
It'll keep the horses out.

01:41:38.539 --> 01:41:41.876
We don't need all the fields.
One patch per family will do.

01:41:42.084 --> 01:41:43.586
Then...

01:41:44.128 --> 01:41:48.424
it'll take at least a day to flatten
the paths and draw the water.

01:41:48.632 --> 01:41:50.968
Understood.

01:41:51.302 --> 01:41:53.554
There's one other thing.

01:41:54.054 --> 01:42:00.352
You need to leave the houses this side
of the bridge, and the mill too.

01:42:01.437 --> 01:42:03.230
Father!

01:42:03.522 --> 01:42:05.649
You want us to move out?

01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:15.242
I know it's tough.

01:42:16.911 --> 01:42:19.038
But there's no choice.

01:42:20.664 --> 01:42:24.585
We can't possibly protect
the outlying houses.

01:42:45.773 --> 01:42:49.068
Listen carefully. You'll soon
begin harvesting the barley.

01:42:49.318 --> 01:42:51.278
The bandits will come
when you're done.

01:42:51.445 --> 01:42:53.322
We have to assume that.

01:42:53.531 --> 01:42:57.284
Therefore we prepare
for battle as we harvest.

01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:01.205
We'll harvest not as families
but as squads.

01:43:01.705 --> 01:43:06.001
Starting tomorrow,
each squad will live and work as one.

01:43:06.210 --> 01:43:11.090
Understood? Starting tomorrow,
nobody acts on his own.

01:43:12.383 --> 01:43:14.260
Hey, everybody.

01:43:15.886 --> 01:43:19.807
Give your wives
plenty of lovin' tonight, you hear?

01:43:40.995 --> 01:43:43.539
This is all a load of crap!

01:43:43.747 --> 01:43:46.500
Everyone from across the bridge,
follow me.

01:43:49.211 --> 01:43:51.297
Throw down your spears.

01:43:51.505 --> 01:43:55.509
Why should we abandon
our homes to protect theirs?

01:43:56.427 --> 01:43:59.972
That's right.
We'll protect our homes ourselves.

01:44:02.057 --> 01:44:03.642
Stop!

01:44:06.812 --> 01:44:08.647
Pick up your spears!

01:44:09.315 --> 01:44:10.774
Return to your line!

01:44:36.592 --> 01:44:38.844
Fall in!

01:44:39.762 --> 01:44:42.014
Squad formation!

01:44:45.059 --> 01:44:47.478
Where's Yohei gone?

01:44:48.896 --> 01:44:50.564
Where the hell's Yohei?

01:44:56.111 --> 01:44:59.198
There you are, you idiot!

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:19.009
There are three outlying houses,

01:45:19.885 --> 01:45:21.887
but 20 in the village.

01:45:22.763 --> 01:45:26.725
We can't risk 20
to save three.

01:45:27.977 --> 01:45:32.273
And if this village is destroyed,

01:45:33.148 --> 01:45:35.359
those three cannot survive
on their own.

01:45:39.446 --> 01:45:42.908
Is that clear?
This is the nature of war:

01:45:44.451 --> 01:45:47.246
By protecting others,
you save yourself.

01:45:49.248 --> 01:45:51.709
If you only think of yourself,

01:45:52.209 --> 01:45:54.378
you'll only destroy yourself.

01:45:57.464 --> 01:46:01.260
From this day forward,
anyone caught doing that...

01:52:33.308 --> 01:52:34.935
Hot damn!

01:52:35.144 --> 01:52:36.937
Look at all those girls!

01:52:37.229 --> 01:52:38.564
Hey, Yohei!

01:52:44.153 --> 01:52:46.905
Where the hell
have you been hiding these girls?

01:52:51.243 --> 01:52:52.995
You devil.

01:53:00.836 --> 01:53:03.088
Hey, lend me your scythe.

01:53:04.298 --> 01:53:06.300
I'll cut three times your share.

01:53:06.508 --> 01:53:09.511
In return,
we get nice and friendly, eh?

01:53:33.577 --> 01:53:34.995
- Rikichi.
- Yes.

01:53:36.205 --> 01:53:39.875
It seems the married couples
are the most productive.

01:53:40.584 --> 01:53:42.711
Time you got yourself a wife.

01:53:46.131 --> 01:53:50.260
Why do you always get so mad?
I just said you should --

01:53:51.512 --> 01:53:53.764
Katsushiro, go after him.

01:53:53.972 --> 01:53:56.058
Running off at a time like this.

01:53:57.267 --> 01:53:58.685
Rikichi!

01:53:59.728 --> 01:54:01.146
Rikichi!

01:54:05.359 --> 01:54:08.028
Shino, what are you gawking at?

01:54:24.169 --> 01:54:27.339
What's this? A bear's den?

01:54:29.383 --> 01:54:31.510
This was done with a scythe.

01:54:33.679 --> 01:54:34.972
Was it Rikichi?

01:54:35.597 --> 01:54:38.058
Yes, though I didn't actually
see him do it.

01:54:38.267 --> 01:54:40.435
I lost him for a while,

01:54:40.644 --> 01:54:42.521
but then I spotted him
leaving this grove.

01:54:42.729 --> 01:54:45.858
He was furious,
soaked in sweat.

01:54:49.444 --> 01:54:51.113
What did you say to him?

01:54:51.321 --> 01:54:54.783
Nothing. Just that he should
hurry up and find a wife.

01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:02.291
Something's upsetting the little bugger,
but he won't say what.

01:55:02.791 --> 01:55:05.169
You can see it
all over his face.

01:55:06.003 --> 01:55:11.550
Those lips of his
are bolted up tight as a house.

01:55:11.758 --> 01:55:14.136
Why don't you try to open them up?

01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:22.436
Who's there?

01:55:22.644 --> 01:55:23.896
<i>It's me. </i>

01:55:26.273 --> 01:55:28.775
All clear?
- Yes.

01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:40.162
Have a seat.
Let's have a little chat.

01:55:45.375 --> 01:55:48.879
I think talking...

01:55:49.588 --> 01:55:51.423
is a good thing.

01:55:52.007 --> 01:55:55.969
Whatever your burden may be,
talking can ease it.

01:55:59.223 --> 01:56:03.101
You, for example,
seem pretty tight-lipped,

01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:08.232
but if you're suffering,
you shouldn't bottle it up.

01:56:11.026 --> 01:56:15.489
Letting out your feelings
bit by bit can work wonders.

01:56:16.782 --> 01:56:19.409
I've got nothing to say.

01:56:37.052 --> 01:56:38.887
Time to head out.

01:56:41.431 --> 01:56:42.474
Shall we wake him?

01:56:42.683 --> 01:56:44.852
No, let the kid sleep.

01:56:48.814 --> 01:56:50.232
Shino.

01:56:53.026 --> 01:56:55.070
I swear he just said "Shino."

01:56:58.115 --> 01:56:59.950
Sounds like a woman's name.

01:57:00.159 --> 01:57:02.953
Even kids can be charmers
in their dreams.

01:57:09.376 --> 01:57:11.879
Where shall we start our rounds?

01:57:12.087 --> 01:57:15.257
The place that worries us most,
of course.

01:58:12.648 --> 01:58:14.107
Who's there?

01:58:20.948 --> 01:58:22.449
Who's there?

01:58:22.991 --> 01:58:24.660
Come out here!

01:58:25.410 --> 01:58:26.370
Who's there?

01:58:26.578 --> 01:58:27.996
Kikuchiyo.

01:58:30.332 --> 01:58:32.417
You're lucky it was us.

01:58:32.835 --> 01:58:35.963
If we'd been bandits,
you'd be headless right now.

01:59:07.995 --> 01:59:09.496
Yohei.

01:59:10.873 --> 01:59:12.583
What's this?

01:59:12.916 --> 01:59:15.002
That's my horse, sir.

01:59:17.337 --> 01:59:20.132
I thought it was a big old mouse.

01:59:59.797 --> 02:00:03.842
<i>The sparrows chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

02:00:04.802 --> 02:00:08.597
<i>The crows caw, caw, caw</i>

02:00:12.434 --> 02:00:15.687
I wonder why
the bandits aren't coming.

02:00:18.023 --> 02:00:23.445
What a waste if they don't.
Think how much we feed those samurai.

02:00:23.612 --> 02:00:27.407
Idiot!
It's best if they don't come!

02:00:33.956 --> 02:00:37.209
A nag like that
can't carry your weight!

02:00:37.417 --> 02:00:40.671
Yohei's horse is too worn out.

02:00:42.798 --> 02:00:45.884
Please stop. Yohei'll be in tears
if you break its leg.

02:00:46.093 --> 02:00:49.596
A skilled horseman
can make even a nag soar into the sky.

02:01:01.650 --> 02:01:02.860
Not bad.

02:01:18.625 --> 02:01:20.544
Very fine indeed!

02:01:44.568 --> 02:01:46.612
They seem to be having fun.

02:01:48.197 --> 02:01:51.033
The threshing's done,
and still no bandits.

02:01:51.492 --> 02:01:54.870
Everyone's saying
they might not come after all.

02:01:56.121 --> 02:01:58.373
A tempting thought.

02:01:58.874 --> 02:02:04.087
But when you think you're safe
is precisely when you're most vulnerable.

02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:07.800
Send them back
to their posts.

02:02:41.250 --> 02:02:45.003
I wish I'd been born
into a samurai family.

02:02:48.132 --> 02:02:50.092
A farmer's life is too cruel.

02:02:51.218 --> 02:02:54.221
My life has been so easy,
I'm ashamed.

02:02:54.429 --> 02:02:56.765
That's not what I meant.

02:02:57.141 --> 02:03:01.603
It's because you're a samurai
and I'm a farmer.

02:03:01.812 --> 02:03:03.230
But I don't --

02:03:03.438 --> 02:03:06.650
It's all right. I don't mind.
We can't know

02:03:06.859 --> 02:03:09.027
what the future holds!

02:03:42.352 --> 02:03:45.564
Coward!
Act like a samurai!

02:04:52.631 --> 02:04:55.384
Three suspicious characters
on the western road.

02:04:57.845 --> 02:05:00.597
- The villagers haven't noticed?
- Not yet.

02:05:00.806 --> 02:05:02.850
We can't have them
sounding the alarm.

02:05:05.227 --> 02:05:08.147
I saw three horses
up in the hills.

02:05:08.355 --> 02:05:11.233
I think they're bandits.
- We know.

02:05:15.946 --> 02:05:18.157
- So they're here.
- How did you know?

02:05:18.365 --> 02:05:21.535
How could I not?
This one here was in such a panic.

02:05:24.955 --> 02:05:27.541
Where are they coming from?
The mountains or the west?

02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:31.420
The west.

02:05:40.095 --> 02:05:40.971
Bandits!

02:05:45.517 --> 02:05:48.562
Send everyone to their houses.
There are only three of them.

02:05:48.770 --> 02:05:51.565
Tell them to keep quiet
no matter what.

02:05:51.773 --> 02:05:56.111
They're probably scouts.
We can't let them see any samurai.

02:06:13.337 --> 02:06:15.422
What is it?

02:06:15.881 --> 02:06:17.633
Bandits?

02:06:20.302 --> 02:06:23.347
Bandits, eh?
Where are they?

02:06:35.025 --> 02:06:36.318
Quiet!

02:06:38.362 --> 02:06:40.197
Where are they, Shichiroji?

02:06:40.405 --> 02:06:43.117
Beyond the fence.

02:06:57.506 --> 02:07:00.092
No doubt about it -- they're scouts.

02:07:00.634 --> 02:07:02.511
The fence took them by surprise.

02:07:03.637 --> 02:07:06.014
They don't seem
to realize we're here.

02:07:06.181 --> 02:07:09.309
With luck they'll report
there are only farmers here.

02:07:10.853 --> 02:07:13.438
<i>Hey, where is everyone?</i>

02:07:13.647 --> 02:07:15.315
That idiot!

02:07:16.358 --> 02:07:18.277
Kikuchiyo!

02:07:24.533 --> 02:07:26.869
Hey, I hear the bandits are here.

02:07:28.537 --> 02:07:29.329
You fool.

02:07:29.538 --> 02:07:31.832
Too late.
They've seen us.

02:07:42.718 --> 02:07:46.180
If they report back that samurai
are here, we're finished.

02:07:47.097 --> 02:07:50.184
I'll kill them.
The mountain's my territory.

02:07:50.559 --> 02:07:51.560
I was just --

02:07:51.768 --> 02:07:55.522
Enough. You can make up for it
by getting one.

02:07:55.731 --> 02:07:57.065
Head them off at --

02:07:57.274 --> 02:08:00.110
I know, at their horses.
Take us there.

02:08:01.278 --> 02:08:02.863
Katsushiro!

02:08:03.739 --> 02:08:06.241
Just watch, you understand?

02:08:13.332 --> 02:08:15.501
Those are some horses!

02:08:20.339 --> 02:08:22.216
Wait in this hollow.

02:08:31.099 --> 02:08:33.811
- What do you plan to do?
- Who, me?

02:10:34.223 --> 02:10:36.391
Katsushiro.

02:10:37.226 --> 02:10:39.436
You can come out now.

02:10:42.773 --> 02:10:44.608
Help me!

02:11:03.710 --> 02:11:05.420
Back off!

02:11:06.755 --> 02:11:11.009
He's a captive who has confessed.
He's begging for his life.

02:11:11.218 --> 02:11:14.638
You can't just
chop him to pieces.

02:11:15.973 --> 02:11:17.182
Stay out of this!

02:11:18.934 --> 02:11:21.145
Let me do it! Scum!

02:11:39.246 --> 02:11:40.998
All right.

02:11:41.457 --> 02:11:44.084
Let her avenge her son's death.

02:11:46.462 --> 02:11:49.173
Someone help her!

02:11:49.381 --> 02:11:50.966
I'll do it!

02:11:59.850 --> 02:12:03.604
- That bandit said their fort --
- It's hardly a fort.

02:12:03.812 --> 02:12:07.649
It's full of holes,
like Yohei's underwear.

02:12:07.816 --> 02:12:10.152
- Easy to sneak in.
- Let's attack at night.

02:12:10.319 --> 02:12:13.906
They have 40 men.
We'd usually pick off a few first.

02:12:14.114 --> 02:12:17.034
Wait. We can't afford
to lose a single man,

02:12:17.242 --> 02:12:19.661
even if we kill five
for every one lost.

02:12:19.828 --> 02:12:24.374
- War is always a gamble.
- Three of us can take 10 of them.

02:12:25.417 --> 02:12:26.919
Rikichi.

02:12:27.127 --> 02:12:30.047
How far away is their hideout?

02:12:30.255 --> 02:12:31.715
At least a day.

02:12:31.924 --> 02:12:34.718
Hey, we've got
three of their horses.

02:12:34.927 --> 02:12:36.970
Half a day by horse.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.627
Very well. Let's do it.

02:12:51.835 --> 02:12:54.755
If we leave now,
we'll arrive before dawn.

02:12:54.963 --> 02:12:56.673
But who should go?

02:12:59.885 --> 02:13:01.011
Not you.

02:13:03.764 --> 02:13:06.058
And me makes three.

02:13:06.975 --> 02:13:08.852
They need a guide!

02:13:09.061 --> 02:13:11.438
There aren't enough horses.

02:13:11.647 --> 02:13:13.649
There's Yohei's horse.
You ride that.

02:13:13.857 --> 02:13:16.068
The only man
to master that steed

02:13:16.276 --> 02:13:17.820
is Lord Kikuchiyo himself.

02:13:26.954 --> 02:13:29.123
Whoa! What the hell?

02:13:29.998 --> 02:13:32.167
It's the other way!

02:13:34.628 --> 02:13:36.463
Stupid horse!

02:13:37.131 --> 02:13:41.051
This way, you useless mule!

02:13:41.844 --> 02:13:44.388
You call yourself a horse?

02:13:44.596 --> 02:13:46.682
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

02:13:48.642 --> 02:13:50.436
Hey, wait!

02:13:52.771 --> 02:13:56.567
Please stop!
I apologize!

02:13:56.775 --> 02:13:58.235
I'm sorry!

02:15:24.822 --> 02:15:27.241
Hey, let's set the place on fire!

02:15:27.449 --> 02:15:29.326
Cut 'em down as they run out!

02:18:03.689 --> 02:18:05.648
Serves you right!

02:18:06.316 --> 02:18:08.026
We did it!

02:18:10.486 --> 02:18:12.448
Take that, you sons of bitches!

02:18:55.491 --> 02:18:56.784
Heihachi!

02:19:17.638 --> 02:19:19.932
Are you crazy?

02:19:35.739 --> 02:19:36.949
Stupid idiot!

02:19:37.156 --> 02:19:40.369
Look what you've done!
Who is she to you?

02:19:41.745 --> 02:19:44.081
She's my wife!

02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:50.421
Heihachi, hang on!

02:20:29.626 --> 02:20:31.253
You said...

02:20:33.297 --> 02:20:36.300
he'd be a treasure
in hard times.

02:20:38.093 --> 02:20:40.429
The hard times
have only just begun.

02:20:50.564 --> 02:20:51.774
Stop crying!

02:20:52.524 --> 02:20:54.568
Damn fool!

02:20:55.861 --> 02:20:57.488
Stop crying!

02:22:25.409 --> 02:22:27.494
Goddamn!
Here they come!

02:23:40.734 --> 02:23:44.488
Take note:
They have three muskets.

02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:12.307
Twenty riders bound north,
13 south.

02:24:12.516 --> 02:24:14.643
- Muskets?
- Three in all.

02:24:15.853 --> 02:24:18.856
Take the south, and watch out
for those muskets.

02:25:15.204 --> 02:25:17.498
Retreat! Retreat!

02:25:33.138 --> 02:25:36.642
- The 12 headed south have turned east.
- Wasn't that 13?

02:25:36.892 --> 02:25:38.811
An arrow got one of them.

02:25:39.019 --> 02:25:40.562
Good old Gorobei.

02:25:43.357 --> 02:25:46.610
Make sure the eastern bridge is out,
and watch out for --

02:25:46.819 --> 02:25:48.320
The muskets!

02:25:57.412 --> 02:26:00.958
Take the north.
That's where we'll battle it out.

02:26:01.959 --> 02:26:05.379
If you knew that, why didn't
you build a fence there too?

02:26:05.587 --> 02:26:07.965
Every great castle
needs a breach.

02:26:08.173 --> 02:26:12.428
Draw the enemy there and attack.
You can't win by defense alone.

02:26:24.189 --> 02:26:26.316
Use your balls,
if you've got any!

02:26:30.446 --> 02:26:32.948
Take it away, damn it!

02:26:36.493 --> 02:26:39.204
Twelve riders are on the way.
Hurry with the bridge!

02:26:39.455 --> 02:26:42.124
Are you blind?
What do you think we're doing?

02:26:44.084 --> 02:26:46.462
And he said
to watch out for the muskets.

02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:48.630
What kinda idiot
you take me for?

02:26:55.304 --> 02:26:56.638
Where are you going?

02:26:56.847 --> 02:26:59.641
We're looking for Father.
We can't find him anywhere.

02:26:59.975 --> 02:27:04.521
Father intends to die in that barn.
That's what he's always wanted.

02:27:10.277 --> 02:27:12.404
Stubborn old fool!

02:27:12.946 --> 02:27:15.115
Hurry up and get him!

02:27:18.702 --> 02:27:20.746
Get out of our way!

02:27:21.705 --> 02:27:25.042
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

02:27:46.855 --> 02:27:49.149
- On this mountain --
- Twenty riders.

02:27:49.566 --> 02:27:52.152
And 12 to the east.

02:27:52.361 --> 02:27:53.737
Right.

02:28:09.586 --> 02:28:12.673
This won't do.
They're all scared stiff.

02:28:16.552 --> 02:28:18.095
Good! Again!

02:28:19.721 --> 02:28:21.223
Again!

02:28:24.601 --> 02:28:27.771
Shichiroji's at it.
Let's fire ours up too.

02:28:29.314 --> 02:28:30.983
Everybody out here!

02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:38.740
Raise your spears
and give the battle cry.

02:28:43.412 --> 02:28:44.288
Again!

02:28:48.667 --> 02:28:51.587
Damn 'em, listen to that!
We can beat 'em!

02:28:55.507 --> 02:28:58.135
Yohei, what's that look for?
Again!

02:29:03.348 --> 02:29:05.267
Take cover!

02:29:10.022 --> 02:29:11.857
Here they come!

02:29:28.499 --> 02:29:29.917
Goddamn 'em!

02:30:06.203 --> 02:30:09.331
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

02:30:13.710 --> 02:30:15.921
Oh, no, you don't!

02:30:20.717 --> 02:30:22.302
Don't panic!

02:30:31.228 --> 02:30:33.647
Goddamn you!

02:30:37.734 --> 02:30:39.194
They're burning!

02:30:39.611 --> 02:30:41.488
Damn bastards!

02:31:11.310 --> 02:31:14.354
Back to your posts, everyone!

02:31:15.564 --> 02:31:17.232
Dear!

02:31:19.193 --> 02:31:21.904
They're just rickety shacks!

02:31:24.865 --> 02:31:27.826
Everybody, back to your posts!

02:31:39.338 --> 02:31:40.839
Goddamn it!

02:31:42.591 --> 02:31:44.259
You dogs!

02:31:44.593 --> 02:31:47.137
That's the Old Man's house!

02:31:49.723 --> 02:31:52.392
Where's the Old Man?
What about that couple?

02:31:52.893 --> 02:31:55.854
And the little brat?
What the hell's going on?

02:31:58.982 --> 02:32:01.902
Stop!
You can't abandon your post!

02:32:03.862 --> 02:32:05.906
Kikuchiyo, come back!

02:32:08.033 --> 02:32:09.493
Kikuchiyo!

02:32:24.675 --> 02:32:27.469
Where's the Old Man
and your husband?

02:32:37.479 --> 02:32:40.399
She's been speared.
How'd she make it this far?

02:32:46.905 --> 02:32:48.782
Let's go!

02:32:55.372 --> 02:32:57.499
Damn it, what is it now?

02:33:00.711 --> 02:33:03.380
This baby... is me.

02:33:03.881 --> 02:33:06.383
This is just
what happened to me!

02:34:15.202 --> 02:34:17.079
Here we go!

02:34:25.838 --> 02:34:27.881
What the hell?

02:34:42.146 --> 02:34:44.648
What the hell
were you staring at?

02:34:45.816 --> 02:34:47.401
Idiot!

02:35:49.713 --> 02:35:51.757
No one wounded?

02:35:52.174 --> 02:35:54.593
Good.
You did a fine job.

02:35:54.802 --> 02:35:56.428
Fine job!

02:35:59.807 --> 02:36:02.017
Gunpowder!
Take cover!

02:36:12.569 --> 02:36:14.238
Manzo!

02:36:28.043 --> 02:36:29.962
Where were you hit?

02:36:30.504 --> 02:36:33.632
Shino! Shino!
Bring me my daughter.

02:36:34.883 --> 02:36:36.260
Don't bother.

02:36:36.677 --> 02:36:39.555
If this kills you,
you'd die of a fleabite.

02:36:40.806 --> 02:36:43.350
You make a ruckus
over a little scratch

02:36:43.559 --> 02:36:47.396
and blow your daughter's cover
in the process. Nice going!

02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:19.011
You don't have
to chase them all down.

02:37:22.473 --> 02:37:24.516
That's far enough.
Well done.

02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:27.186
Who are you?

02:37:29.104 --> 02:37:30.773
Rikichi.

02:37:45.829 --> 02:37:48.290
They've attacked from the east,
west and south

02:37:48.499 --> 02:37:51.460
and run away each time
with their tails between their legs.

02:37:51.668 --> 02:37:53.378
This is the only approach left.

02:37:53.587 --> 02:37:56.173
We don't know
if they'll come tonight,

02:37:56.381 --> 02:37:58.467
but when they do,
they'll mass their forces here.

02:37:58.675 --> 02:38:00.344
Perhaps, but...

02:38:01.053 --> 02:38:03.097
I don't hear a thing.

02:38:16.193 --> 02:38:17.903
Nevertheless,

02:38:18.695 --> 02:38:20.989
this will surely
be the focus of their attack.

02:38:21.448 --> 02:38:23.367
I'll prove it to you in a minute.

02:39:07.411 --> 02:39:08.746
Good work.

02:39:08.912 --> 02:39:11.957
Now poke that scarecrow out
from behind those trees.

02:39:46.533 --> 02:39:49.578
I'd say tomorrow morning

02:39:49.953 --> 02:39:52.414
they'll attack us here
with everything they've got.

02:39:52.623 --> 02:39:55.501
And we'll let them in.

02:39:59.463 --> 02:40:02.591
Don't worry.
I mean we'll let one in.

02:40:03.675 --> 02:40:05.636
Two at most.

02:40:06.637 --> 02:40:10.307
Once they're in,
we form a wall again with our spears.

02:40:11.058 --> 02:40:13.894
The one or two who get in
are as good as dead.

02:40:14.103 --> 02:40:16.105
We can cook 'em up
any way we want.

02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:22.986
We'll pick them off patiently,
one by one, until the final showdown.

02:40:23.195 --> 02:40:25.197
Those muskets worry me.

02:40:25.405 --> 02:40:27.533
If only we could
get one of them.

02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:33.455
I'll go.
I swear I'll get one!

02:40:33.664 --> 02:40:36.583
No. You're looking to die.
I'll go.

02:41:29.762 --> 02:41:31.638
Footsteps! Listen!

02:41:31.847 --> 02:41:35.058
That's enough.
Get some rest.

02:41:35.267 --> 02:41:38.228
It's true! I hear them!
Listen.

02:41:38.437 --> 02:41:40.522
I said enough.

02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:44.526
You're exhausted.
Get some rest.

02:41:47.321 --> 02:41:48.989
I hear them.

02:42:17.184 --> 02:42:18.894
Two more down.

02:42:53.929 --> 02:42:55.097
What is it?

02:42:58.225 --> 02:43:02.271
State your business.
I'm going to get some sleep.

02:43:03.814 --> 02:43:07.276
You are a magnificent person.

02:43:11.655 --> 02:43:15.701
I've wanted to tell you so
for some time.

02:43:41.727 --> 02:43:43.437
They're here.

02:43:47.566 --> 02:43:49.526
We'll let one in.

02:43:52.362 --> 02:43:54.281
We're letting one in!

02:44:01.747 --> 02:44:06.210
Remember, after the first one's in,
jump out with your spears.

02:44:25.145 --> 02:44:26.355
Here they come.

02:45:02.349 --> 02:45:04.059
Step aside!

02:45:06.645 --> 02:45:08.147
Good work.

02:45:15.904 --> 02:45:18.907
What's wrong?
You did well.

02:45:19.450 --> 02:45:21.368
Here he comes!
Scatter!

02:45:38.969 --> 02:45:41.138
Fall back! Fall back!

02:45:46.810 --> 02:45:48.854
After them!

02:45:57.196 --> 02:45:58.822
Another on the way!

02:47:41.175 --> 02:47:42.885
Here he comes.

02:47:59.151 --> 02:48:00.903
Watch this!

02:48:06.909 --> 02:48:09.578
Having fun
with your horsey?

02:48:31.391 --> 02:48:35.896
They've stopped.
Won't fall for that trick again, eh?

02:48:44.863 --> 02:48:47.991
They're all wimps!
Who's scared of bandits anyway?

02:48:54.957 --> 02:49:00.170
That little skirmish just cost them four.
Kyuzo got two last night.

02:49:16.812 --> 02:49:19.022
That man is a true samurai.

02:49:19.398 --> 02:49:22.025
He's fearless,
his swordsmanship is amazing,

02:49:22.234 --> 02:49:23.902
and yet he's kind too.

02:49:24.111 --> 02:49:27.781
He never once boasted
about capturing that musket.

02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:32.703
He walked into a forest filled with bandits
as if on a mushroom hunt.

02:49:34.121 --> 02:49:38.375
Fascinating.
I'm not bored at all, I swear.

02:49:56.268 --> 02:49:58.145
Hey, Yohei.

02:49:59.062 --> 02:50:00.564
Take over for me.

02:50:03.734 --> 02:50:06.695
What's that face for?

02:50:06.904 --> 02:50:09.031
There's no danger here now.

02:50:10.699 --> 02:50:12.826
You make a great scarecrow.

02:51:44.334 --> 02:51:45.586
Hear me good!

02:51:46.670 --> 02:51:49.047
If anybody else turns yellow --

02:51:55.262 --> 02:51:56.597
Out of my way!

02:53:20.139 --> 02:53:21.348
Hey!

02:53:25.144 --> 02:53:26.270
How's it goin'?

02:53:26.478 --> 02:53:28.480
Man, they're a pain.

02:53:28.814 --> 02:53:30.899
Won't be long now.

02:53:31.358 --> 02:53:34.570
Everything's upside down.

02:53:34.778 --> 02:53:38.574
They burn us out,
and we starve like farmers.

02:53:39.450 --> 02:53:42.244
Quit your moaning.
There are better times ahead.

02:53:42.453 --> 02:53:44.747
Do your part, man.

02:54:24.495 --> 02:54:26.622
Hey, it's me!

02:54:33.962 --> 02:54:35.631
Serves you right, you dogs!

02:54:35.839 --> 02:54:36.840
Fool!

02:54:38.008 --> 02:54:40.010
Why did you leave your post?

02:54:40.219 --> 02:54:41.553
Just look at this!

02:54:41.762 --> 02:54:45.349
Don't scold me, man.
My post is fine.

02:54:46.225 --> 02:54:49.728
There's nothing heroic
about selfishly grabbing for glory.

02:54:49.937 --> 02:54:54.108
Listen to me:
War is not fought alone!

02:55:04.535 --> 02:55:07.496
Gorobei and Kyuzo,
guard this post!

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.002
Let no one pass!

02:57:23.963 --> 02:57:26.716
Stop, you asses!

02:57:26.924 --> 02:57:28.593
Damn you!

02:57:29.260 --> 02:57:31.220
Damn it! Two made it in!

02:57:46.944 --> 02:57:49.947
Goddamn it!

02:57:50.698 --> 02:57:52.241
Where's Yohei?

02:58:32.281 --> 02:58:33.574
Yohei!

02:58:35.243 --> 02:58:36.577
Yohei!

02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:40.248
I defended my post.

02:58:40.456 --> 02:58:43.084
Don't give up, Yohei!

02:58:46.462 --> 02:58:48.297
Go ahead, shoot me!

02:59:26.335 --> 02:59:28.045
Shichiroji, take over!

02:59:39.348 --> 02:59:41.184
Gorobei!

02:59:50.860 --> 02:59:52.862
Gorobei!

03:00:44.831 --> 03:00:47.041
Just 13 left.

03:00:47.708 --> 03:00:49.710
But these last seven...

03:00:51.003 --> 03:00:53.047
came at a steep price.

03:01:14.277 --> 03:01:16.946
How are you? Tired?

03:01:18.906 --> 03:01:22.785
Poor man.
You've lost a lot of weight.

03:01:26.998 --> 03:01:29.500
I'll go throw
some water on my face.

03:01:40.136 --> 03:01:42.763
<i>Next time they come,
we fight to the finish.</i>

03:01:42.972 --> 03:01:47.226
It's better we fight it out
before we're spent.

03:01:47.477 --> 03:01:51.022
When do you think
they'll attack?

03:01:52.482 --> 03:01:55.443
They're exhausted too,
and a few are wounded.

03:01:55.902 --> 03:01:57.945
They won't come tonight.

03:01:58.154 --> 03:02:03.367
But they have no food,
and their ranks are splitting.

03:02:04.327 --> 03:02:06.370
They can't afford
to dawdle either.

03:02:06.662 --> 03:02:12.794
I say they'll come at us like hell
tomorrow morning.

03:02:14.170 --> 03:02:15.797
Katsushiro.

03:02:35.358 --> 03:02:36.818
An order from above.

03:02:37.026 --> 03:02:40.154
Place two on watch
and let the rest sleep.

03:02:40.863 --> 03:02:44.826
The men may visit their families
one at a time.

03:02:46.702 --> 03:02:48.162
So tomorrow's the showdown?

03:02:50.248 --> 03:02:52.416
Yes.
Please carry out the order.

03:02:59.173 --> 03:03:02.927
You all heard what he just said.

03:03:06.973 --> 03:03:09.350
I'll stand guard.

03:03:10.017 --> 03:03:11.853
The rest of you sleep.

03:03:12.895 --> 03:03:16.065
Manzo...

03:03:16.899 --> 03:03:18.901
you go home first.

03:03:19.360 --> 03:03:21.696
Take a good look
at your daughter --

03:03:22.572 --> 03:03:24.782
I mean, your son.

03:03:33.833 --> 03:03:35.084
I told them.

03:03:35.293 --> 03:03:37.420
All right. Get some rest.

03:03:41.507 --> 03:03:43.801
Katsushiro.

03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:46.304
How was Kikuchiyo?

03:03:46.512 --> 03:03:49.557
Still beside the grave.

03:03:49.849 --> 03:03:51.058
I see.

03:05:04.465 --> 03:05:07.260
Are we all going
to die tomorrow?

03:05:07.468 --> 03:05:10.513
There's no way to know.

03:05:11.180 --> 03:05:13.683
But we might!

03:05:35.955 --> 03:05:37.331
Shino.

03:05:37.999 --> 03:05:39.625
Where's Shino?

03:05:45.339 --> 03:05:46.841
Anyone seen Shino?

03:06:21.375 --> 03:06:23.920
Sake, eh?
Where'd you find it?

03:06:39.268 --> 03:06:42.230
I see. They have stockpiles,
just like Kikuchiyo said,

03:06:42.438 --> 03:06:44.440
and tonight it all comes out.

03:06:53.866 --> 03:06:56.410
I think I'll help myself.

03:07:00.206 --> 03:07:01.707
Shino!

03:07:27.567 --> 03:07:30.611
Here's some sake.
Drink up and get some sleep.

03:07:35.908 --> 03:07:40.121
This is hardly like you.
You must rest for the battle tomorrow.

03:07:51.757 --> 03:07:53.801
Shino!

03:08:58.991 --> 03:09:00.827
<i>You tramp!</i>

03:09:10.336 --> 03:09:13.381
You wench!

03:09:17.301 --> 03:09:19.428
Stop this brutality!

03:09:19.637 --> 03:09:23.891
What the hell's a farmer girl
doing with a samurai?

03:09:49.417 --> 03:09:51.043
You slut!

03:10:01.220 --> 03:10:02.722
Manzo.

03:10:03.639 --> 03:10:06.142
Is this your daughter?

03:10:12.648 --> 03:10:14.442
Tell me what happened.

03:10:14.650 --> 03:10:18.988
You mentioned a samurai.
Who was it?

03:10:20.615 --> 03:10:22.074
Manzo!

03:10:31.834 --> 03:10:33.669
Manzo, say something.

03:10:34.796 --> 03:10:36.297
Speak!

03:11:08.704 --> 03:11:10.873
Are you Shino?

03:11:30.143 --> 03:11:33.312
Manzo, don't be angry.

03:11:34.814 --> 03:11:37.859
When the dawn threatens
our very lives,

03:11:38.067 --> 03:11:41.362
the weight of it
makes us all a little reckless.

03:11:47.243 --> 03:11:49.704
On the eve of decisive battles...

03:11:51.330 --> 03:11:54.041
this often happens,
even inside castles.

03:11:56.919 --> 03:12:00.965
Remember what it was to be young.
You can't blame them.

03:12:01.924 --> 03:12:04.010
I can't forgive them.

03:12:04.260 --> 03:12:07.388
I can't stand by when my only daughter
has been made damaged goods.

03:12:22.028 --> 03:12:26.616
What's wrong with two people in love?
It's not like bandits took her!

03:13:59.041 --> 03:14:03.296
They're wound up tight.
We need to loosen them up.

03:14:11.387 --> 03:14:14.640
Everyone, the final battle
is here at last.

03:14:17.685 --> 03:14:21.856
By the way, Katsushiro,
we expect much of you today.

03:14:23.691 --> 03:14:26.694
As of last night,
you became a real man.

03:14:44.754 --> 03:14:46.297
Hey!

03:14:49.258 --> 03:14:52.386
Where's that fighting spirit?

03:14:54.180 --> 03:14:57.725
You'll never win
with such long faces!

03:15:11.322 --> 03:15:13.407
Kikuchiyo, what are you up to?

03:15:13.616 --> 03:15:15.910
I can't kill five
with just one blade.

03:15:31.634 --> 03:15:33.553
There are 13 left.

03:15:34.762 --> 03:15:38.683
We'll let them all in.

03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:42.687
Once they pass this point,

03:15:43.229 --> 03:15:47.066
we close in from all sides
at the crossing.

03:15:49.986 --> 03:15:54.115
Everything's riding
on this battle!

03:16:24.437 --> 03:16:26.647
Here they come!

03:16:50.004 --> 03:16:52.173
Here they come!

03:17:16.697 --> 03:17:18.866
Shichiroji and Katsushiro,
go west!

03:17:19.158 --> 03:17:21.410
Kyuzo, Kikuchiyo, east!

03:19:02.929 --> 03:19:05.848
Katsushiro! Rikichi!

03:19:06.057 --> 03:19:08.684
East! Go east!

03:19:08.893 --> 03:19:10.728
East!

03:19:27.829 --> 03:19:29.580
Shut up!

03:19:30.039 --> 03:19:32.250
Scream and you're dead!

03:20:19.672 --> 03:20:20.840
We did it!

03:20:21.048 --> 03:20:22.341
We did it!

03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:25.261
Head east!

03:20:40.610 --> 03:20:42.987
Katsushiro, pull back!

03:20:45.531 --> 03:20:47.742
Damn you!

03:20:49.494 --> 03:20:50.912
Kikuchiyo!

03:21:27.115 --> 03:21:29.200
Kikuchiyo!

03:21:39.627 --> 03:21:42.672
Where are the bandits?

03:21:42.880 --> 03:21:44.841
They're all dead!

03:22:03.192 --> 03:22:05.987
Once more we survive.

03:25:44.205 --> 03:25:47.875
In the end,
we lost this battle too.

03:25:48.793 --> 03:25:50.002
What?

03:25:50.878 --> 03:25:52.463
I mean,

03:25:52.880 --> 03:25:55.424
the victory belongs
to those peasants.

03:25:56.759 --> 03:25:58.553
Not to us.

03:26:27.790 --> 03:26:32.670
THE END

03:26:33.305 --> 03:26:39.319
