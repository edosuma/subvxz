Let's go.

15:58.126 --> 16:00.628
Do you really think
you can save the boy?

16:00.630 --> 16:02.596
For his sake, surrender.

16:02.598 --> 16:03.998
I'm not making deals
with you.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.935
Hmm. Then we'll let him
make one, shall we?

16:07.937 --> 16:10.237
[ yelps, grunts ]

16:10.239 --> 16:13.674
Your master
cannot save you, boy.

16:13.676 --> 16:15.976
He is unfocused
and undisciplined.

16:15.978 --> 16:17.578
Then we're perfect
for each other.

16:21.883 --> 16:25.686
I do so admire
your persistence.

16:25.688 --> 16:27.121
Ready to die?

16:29.658 --> 16:30.925
No!

16:37.299 --> 16:38.599
Run!

16:54.082 --> 16:57.651
Does yours do that?
Come on! Let's go!

16:57.653 --> 16:59.787
[ sabine ]
guys! This way!

17:04.092 --> 17:06.060
You figured out
it was a trap?
Yeah.

17:06.061 --> 17:07.694
Luminara?
Long gone.

17:07.696 --> 17:09.363
Our new exit?
Landing platform.

17:09.365 --> 17:10.998
Thought it was impossible
to get out that way.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.400
Well, let's hope
the empire thinks so too.

17:16.238 --> 17:18.906
Secure the facility.
Full lockdown.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.008
[ ezra ]
well, that's not helpful.

17:34.956 --> 17:37.057
[ grunts ]
can't do this all day!

17:38.994 --> 17:40.394
Go!

17:53.208 --> 17:54.909
[ sabine ]
I've got it. I--

17:54.911 --> 17:56.410
[ beeping, warbles ]

17:56.412 --> 17:58.245
[ groans ]
I'm locked out of the system.

17:58.247 --> 17:59.747
Ezra?

18:03.985 --> 18:05.119
Sorry.

18:05.121 --> 18:06.387
Ezra.

18:07.455 --> 18:08.756
Together.

18:08.758 --> 18:10.958
Seriously?
Yes.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.993
Picture the locking mechanism
in your mind.

18:20.001 --> 18:22.703
Excuse me,
but can we train ezra later?

18:37.986 --> 18:40.020
One last miracle here.

18:40.022 --> 18:42.790
- [ grunts ]
- [ beeping ]

18:49.464 --> 18:53.100
Spectre-5 to <i> phantom.</i>
We're on the landing deck,
ready for pickup.

18:53.102 --> 18:54.468
<i>[ hera ]</i>
<i>on my way, spectre-5.</i>

18:54.470 --> 18:57.037
<i>And I'm bringing the fleet.</i>
We have a fleet?

19:02.077 --> 19:03.477
We do now.

19:36.311 --> 19:38.178
Does yours do that?

19:51.026 --> 19:54.094
Master luminara?
Gone.

19:54.096 --> 19:55.396
We'll have to find a way
to spread the word.

19:55.398 --> 19:59.166
How's ezra taking it?
Not as bad as I am.

19:59.168 --> 20:01.001
I guess
he's stuck with me.

20:01.003 --> 20:02.303
For now.

20:21.556 --> 20:24.058
Look, don't bother saying it.
I'm letting you off the hook.

20:24.060 --> 20:27.061
What are you talking about?
I know you wanted
to dump me on luminara.

20:27.063 --> 20:30.097
Just 'cause she's gone
doesn't mean
you're stuck with me.

20:30.099 --> 20:33.133
I don't want to dump you.
[ sighs ]

20:37.138 --> 20:39.440
Look, I just wanted you
to have the best teacher.

20:39.442 --> 20:42.109
Well, I don't want
the best teacher.
I want you.

20:44.079 --> 20:46.013
Not that
you're not the best. I--
ezra.

20:46.015 --> 20:48.515
I'm not gonna try
to teach you anymore.

20:51.086 --> 20:55.089
If all I do is try,
that means I don't truly
believe I can succeed.

20:55.091 --> 20:57.157
So from now on,
I <i> will</i> teach you.

20:59.194 --> 21:01.195
Look, I may fail.
You may fail.

21:01.197 --> 21:02.863
But there is no try.

21:05.066 --> 21:08.335
I understand, master.

21:09.404 --> 21:11.071
Let's see if you do.
