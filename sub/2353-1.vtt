WEBVTT

01:01.328 --> 01:03.615
Hey! Hey.

01:05.263 --> 01:07.152
Listen. I'm gonna take off.

01:07.448 --> 01:09.899
Do you mind locking the door

01:09.999 --> 01:11.316
on your way out?

01:12.815 --> 01:14.677
You aren't gonna
buy me breakfast, are you?

01:21.648 --> 01:22.866
No.

01:47.984 --> 01:50.547
You are officially banned
after last night.

01:50.927 --> 01:53.586
I mean, literally,
I can't even remember last night.

01:54.095 --> 01:55.346
You were up on stage.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.103
- No.
- Yeah.

01:57.583 --> 02:00.176
You gave a Russian guy a lap dance,
and he was not into it.

02:00.276 --> 02:03.278
- What?
- Like, really not into it.

02:36.943 --> 02:38.956
- Hey, how are you?
- Pretty good.

02:39.056 --> 02:41.580
I will take a double
Grey Goose on the rocks, please.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.085
What are you paying with?

02:50.031 --> 02:51.211
There you go.

02:51.311 --> 02:52.652
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:52.752 --> 02:53.964
- Hey.
- Hey!

02:54.064 --> 02:56.684
- How you doing? Long time no see.
- I'm good, Mr. Vincent.

02:56.784 --> 02:59.051
How are you? I was gonna call you today.

02:59.151 --> 03:00.563
Hi.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.555
I was hoping I'd find
thirty-seven grand in there for me.

03:04.655 --> 03:07.500
I do all my banking online these days.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.476
Listen, kid, I just learned something

03:10.576 --> 03:11.755
that kind of hurt my feelings.

03:11.855 --> 03:13.260
Oh, yeah? What's that?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.827
According to
a friend of mine down south,

03:16.207 --> 03:20.043
your family has more money
than they know what to do with.

03:20.143 --> 03:23.445
Well, my family and I,
we have parted ways.

03:24.367 --> 03:26.066
That's why I borrow money from you.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.686
Card's declined.

03:29.391 --> 03:30.609
Listen to me.

03:31.183 --> 03:33.516
I know where you work.
I know where you live.

03:33.616 --> 03:36.300
I know where you gamble away
money you don't have.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.211
I know where you go for probation.
I know the whole thing.

03:39.311 --> 03:42.935
And if I don't have my money
by Friday 5:00, I will find you,

03:43.290 --> 03:48.182
and I will smash your head wide open.
I have no problem doing that.

04:00.015 --> 04:03.107
Mr. Wheeler has continued to exhibit,
through a series of offenses...

04:03.207 --> 04:09.163
DUI, resisting arrest, criminal speeding,
participation in unlicensed gaming,

04:09.263 --> 04:11.408
and now aggravated assault...

04:12.111 --> 04:14.283
that he is combative, disruptive,

04:14.383 --> 04:18.123
and has a general disregard
for simple rules and regulations.

04:18.223 --> 04:22.158
He also seems incapable
of obeying the law.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.102
Whoever wrote that just...

04:26.255 --> 04:27.953
just gets me.

04:41.680 --> 04:45.099
That guy and his thick-neck buddy
showed up again. Said you weren't here.

04:45.199 --> 04:46.960
All right. Thank you.

04:49.231 --> 04:51.019
Hey, don't you have somebody
tied up in your basement

04:51.119 --> 04:53.489
you need to go torture,
something like that?

04:58.256 --> 05:00.139
Hey, man, you got no money socked away?
Nothing at all?

05:00.239 --> 05:02.100
Does it look like I got
any money socked away?

05:03.375 --> 05:04.939
What about your family?

05:05.455 --> 05:07.179
You said your brother's getting
married next week, right?

05:07.279 --> 05:09.068
- Yeah, I did. So what?
- So what?

05:09.168 --> 05:10.931
So, get a tux and fly to the party.

05:11.887 --> 05:14.380
Everybody's happy and your old man's
checkbook's already open.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.014
Yeah.

05:16.879 --> 05:18.668
Listen, I think I can make it
to the wedding now.

05:18.768 --> 05:22.795
Oh, that's great.
Here. Talk to your father.

05:22.895 --> 05:25.259
No, Mom. Mom, I don't... Mom!

05:25.359 --> 05:26.860
Hello?

05:28.207 --> 05:31.857
- Hey, Dad.
- Oh, Jay. How are you?

05:32.175 --> 05:37.235
I'm well... I'm well. I've been following
the merger talks in the news.

05:37.679 --> 05:39.275
Looks promising.

05:39.375 --> 05:42.896
Yeah. Yeah.
How's the plan going out there?

05:43.439 --> 05:45.963
It's going very well.
It's going amazing, actually.

05:46.063 --> 05:47.275
I was telling Mom I got a new job.

05:47.375 --> 05:51.787
It's an administration position with one of
the largest psychiatric hospitals out here.

05:51.887 --> 05:52.876
Oh, really?

05:52.976 --> 05:56.620
I've met someone, too,
and she's beautiful.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.379
She's just the greatest thing.
Mom would love her.

05:58.479 --> 06:00.945
Does she take her clothes off
for a living?

06:01.423 --> 06:05.260
No, she doesn't take her clothes off
for a living, Dad. She's a nurse.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.961
You should bring her to the wedding.

06:07.632 --> 06:10.220
- Bring her to the wedding?
- Yeah, sure.

06:11.343 --> 06:13.707
No, she's not gonna be able
to get the time off work.

06:13.807 --> 06:17.075
- She's a nut with the work.
- We both think you should bring her.

06:18.639 --> 06:21.067
Okay, you know what? We'll be there.

06:21.167 --> 06:24.299
Tell Mom we're gonna be there
and we'll be there, okay?

06:24.399 --> 06:25.388
Okay.

06:28.303 --> 06:29.645
Shit.

06:39.119 --> 06:42.098
Would a med tech please report
to physical therapy?

06:42.831 --> 06:46.327
- Mop guy, show us what you got.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:47.248 --> 06:50.539
My God, you look...
you look amazing today.

06:50.639 --> 06:51.915
I wear this every day.

06:52.015 --> 06:55.435
Really? I don't know.
Today, it's really working.

06:55.535 --> 06:56.622
You're single, right?

06:56.911 --> 06:59.665
- Yes, I'm single.
- I'm single, too. This is great.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.252
You're single because you're an asshole.

07:03.247 --> 07:06.190
Yeah, but an interesting
and fun asshole.

07:08.047 --> 07:11.148
I'm gonna cut right to it. My brother's
getting married in New Orleans this weekend,

07:11.248 --> 07:13.195
and I was kind of thinking
if you weren't busy or anything,

07:13.295 --> 07:15.244
- you and me...
- You're serious.

07:15.951 --> 07:16.939
Is that a yes?

07:23.695 --> 07:25.710
This is Daisy Kensington.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.503
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.

07:34.255 --> 07:36.523
Okay, fellas. Break time.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.723
- I'm only here because I refuse to vote.
- I know.

07:39.823 --> 07:44.107
Because I refuse to use credit cards or
go on the internet. They know my record.

07:44.207 --> 07:46.475
They know your record, too, Mr. Wheeler,
if that's your real name.

07:46.575 --> 07:48.619
- It is. Okay.
- They know everything about you.

07:48.719 --> 07:51.214
I am off the grid, baby!

07:52.431 --> 07:54.795
Just because I won't go to websites,
just because I don't have a cell phone,

07:54.895 --> 07:56.523
I won't even look at a television.

07:56.623 --> 07:57.899
- That's why, that's why.
- You don't have to.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.282
Come on. Sit down.

07:59.983 --> 08:01.232
Sit down.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.889
Mr. B., how's the wild man today?

08:06.063 --> 08:08.183
Yeah. She's nice.

08:11.471 --> 08:13.203
Pretty women, Mr. B.
You remember pretty women?

08:17.455 --> 08:18.252
Yeah.

08:19.471 --> 08:21.678
Bertleman wants
to see you in his office.

08:23.983 --> 08:25.707
Listen, I don't know
what Frakel told you.

08:25.807 --> 08:29.301
You're giving alcohol and pornography
to my patients.

08:29.871 --> 08:31.573
They're my friends.

08:31.759 --> 08:35.691
They are,
variously, psychotic, catatonic,

08:35.791 --> 08:39.979
manic, and delusional.
They are also my responsibility.

08:40.078 --> 08:43.082
From this point forward, you will
have no contact with these patients

08:43.183 --> 08:45.231
except to mop the floor
beneath their feet.

08:46.063 --> 08:47.534
Are we clear?

08:48.143 --> 08:50.155
We're clear. Absolutely.

08:50.255 --> 08:53.515
I'm fully aware
that if you lose this job,

08:53.615 --> 08:54.964
you violate your probation.

08:55.631 --> 09:00.011
If you let that happen, you will find yourself
downwind from a Category-5 shit storm.

09:00.111 --> 09:01.387
- Can I...
- I'm done.

09:01.487 --> 09:02.607
Okay.

09:12.335 --> 09:14.831
It's Miss Daisy Kensington, right?

09:18.927 --> 09:21.554
Miss Kensington,
do you know where you are?

09:25.551 --> 09:27.054
It's okay.

09:27.695 --> 09:29.644
This is a psychiatric hospital.

09:31.951 --> 09:36.432
The police report says
that your mother passed away

09:37.103 --> 09:40.619
and you left a note for the mailman

09:40.719 --> 09:42.897
asking him what you should do.

09:49.743 --> 09:52.909
Miss Kensington,
are you aware of the time?

09:53.423 --> 09:56.693
Do you know the day, month, year?

10:03.759 --> 10:06.539
I'm not exactly sure what day it is.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.271
It's okay.

10:09.935 --> 10:11.699
Do you know why you're here?

10:16.239 --> 10:17.931
I guess...

10:27.951 --> 10:29.878
The voices.

10:35.471 --> 10:38.443
- We're gonna do some tests.
- But I'm supposed to be sleeping.

10:38.543 --> 10:39.819
I know. It won't take long.

10:39.919 --> 10:42.864
- Are you a doctor?
- Yeah, I'm your special doctor.

10:44.974 --> 10:46.507
Wait.

10:46.607 --> 10:48.588
Stop. Please.

10:52.175 --> 10:54.699
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- It's okay. It's okay.

10:54.799 --> 10:55.947
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

10:56.047 --> 10:58.598
You didn't do anything wrong.
The guy's a freak. He was gonna hurt you.

10:58.789 --> 11:00.875
- But he's a doctor.
- No, he's not a doctor.

11:00.975 --> 11:03.949
Listen to me. You got to
protect yourself in here. Okay?

11:04.526 --> 11:05.908
You're the mopping man.

11:06.479 --> 11:09.130
- Yeah, I'm Jay.
- Where's your mop?

11:09.230 --> 11:11.569
Doesn't matter. I got to get
out of here. You gonna be okay?

11:12.399 --> 11:15.147
- Mrs. Nealberry, go back to bed, please.
- It's time to get up.

11:15.247 --> 11:17.099
- No, baby. It's time to sleep.
- It's time to sleep.

11:17.199 --> 11:18.963
Hey. Be careful.

11:19.855 --> 11:24.397
It's time to get up.
Wash your face, wash your hands.

11:26.095 --> 11:27.183
Shit.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.443
What are you doing?

11:47.503 --> 11:50.545
- I'm coming with you.
- You can't leave. You're a patient.

11:51.470 --> 11:52.523
I don't like it here.

11:52.623 --> 11:54.827
Yeah, I get that.
But you can't just stand here.

11:54.927 --> 11:57.515
- Where should I stand?
- Come on, come on.

12:03.694 --> 12:05.931
- Where are your shoes?
- I don't have any.

12:06.031 --> 12:08.779
- How come you don't have shoes?
- They hurt my feet.

12:10.383 --> 12:14.094
Look. You got to go back inside. You got
to tell them what happened, okay? Please?

12:15.919 --> 12:17.039
What's wrong?

12:18.287 --> 12:19.505
What's happening?

12:20.014 --> 12:21.942
Okay. Just breathe.

12:23.119 --> 12:27.049
Look at me. Look at me.
Just breathe. Breathe, okay?

12:27.149 --> 12:30.122
Just breath, okay? I really don't care
if you don't want to go back.

12:30.222 --> 12:32.205
You can do whatever you want, okay?

12:33.237 --> 12:34.411
Okay. Look...

12:35.022 --> 12:36.697
Grab a cab.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.259
- Call somebody. Do something, okay?
- Who should I call?

12:39.359 --> 12:41.204
I don't know. You're supposed
to know the people you know.

12:41.766 --> 12:44.001
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:44.559 --> 12:47.409
Take care of yourself. Get some shoes.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.232
What is this place?

13:25.487 --> 13:27.659
- It's a club.
- What kind of club?

13:27.759 --> 13:29.898
- It's a dancing club.
- For people who like to dance?

13:29.998 --> 13:33.226
- Yeah, for people who like to dance.
- Why is it so dark?

13:33.326 --> 13:35.668
It's a club for people
who like dancing in the dark.

13:36.559 --> 13:40.010
- That lady didn't have any clothes on!
- Did she? I didn't even notice.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.930
A lot of people in here
don't have clothes on.

13:42.030 --> 13:45.419
Okay. Take a seat.
I'm gonna go talk to some people.

13:45.519 --> 13:47.252
Just don't move, okay?

13:53.359 --> 13:55.435
You, me, New Orleans.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.667
I don't know. Pretending to be
a nurse makes me uncomfortable.

13:58.767 --> 14:01.650
You hump a pole naked for money,
but this makes you uncomfortable?

14:03.119 --> 14:05.044
You don't see the irony there?

14:08.046 --> 14:10.795
Does anybody want to go
to Jay's brother's wedding?

14:10.895 --> 14:11.947
No.

14:12.047 --> 14:15.436
- Come on, you guys. I need a date.
- And why should we help you?

14:15.982 --> 14:19.051
Because I'm putting you through college with
all those dollars I drop in your panties?

14:19.151 --> 14:20.682
What's in it for us?

14:20.782 --> 14:23.307
The fuzzy feeling you get
helping a friend?

14:32.591 --> 14:34.923
Why are you wearing those shoes?

14:38.735 --> 14:40.813
She dances beautifully!

14:48.143 --> 14:50.290
You might want
to come check on your friend.

15:02.670 --> 15:04.875
Yo, sweets, you got to get out.

15:04.975 --> 15:07.018
But Jay said
that this was a dancing club.

15:07.118 --> 15:10.250
- Jay who?
- Jay. He snuck us in the back.

15:10.350 --> 15:12.660
He said that he didn't want
the bouncer to see us.

15:13.838 --> 15:15.723
No, you got to get down. Come on.

15:15.823 --> 15:17.592
- What? No, no.
- Come on.

15:23.599 --> 15:27.445
- You need to leave now!
- Okay, take it easy. We're going.

15:27.982 --> 15:29.430
You all right?

15:30.254 --> 15:32.522
Okay. We're going. We're going.

15:32.622 --> 15:35.731
Come on. You all right? Okay.

15:36.526 --> 15:40.275
This fat man
offered me $100 for a hand job.

15:40.558 --> 15:42.293
I've never had a job.

15:43.182 --> 15:45.521
You sure you have no one you can call?

15:47.759 --> 15:50.796
You have no friends? You have no family?
You have nobody?

15:55.855 --> 15:57.357
What am I supposed to do with you?

16:16.686 --> 16:19.345
Do you have I.D.?
You got to show I.D. at security.

16:24.206 --> 16:26.993
I have it. It's in here.
What's happening? What's wrong?

16:30.415 --> 16:31.402
I don't know what to do.

16:31.502 --> 16:32.970
That's okay. I have a plan,
and it's a good one.

16:33.070 --> 16:35.115
All you have to do is smile
and eat yummy snacks.

16:35.215 --> 16:39.403
And when people say, "Hey, what do you do?"
you say, "I'm a nurse."

16:39.503 --> 16:40.917
I'm not supposed to lie.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.260
It's not a lie. Not a lie.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.500
- It's pretending, which is fine.
- What's the difference?

16:49.007 --> 16:50.290
I'll explain it to you later.

16:51.279 --> 16:52.689
- Okay.
- Okay?

16:59.950 --> 17:01.770
Your dancer friends really don't mind
I borrowed their clothes?

17:01.870 --> 17:03.684
No. They wanted to help.

17:06.318 --> 17:09.642
- Are you sure this looks okay?
- Yeah. You look fantastic.

17:09.742 --> 17:12.395
Really, you look great.
Just keep the sweater on.

17:12.494 --> 17:13.909
- This?
- Yeah.

17:15.471 --> 17:17.296
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:25.039 --> 17:26.891
I'm sorry. Hi.

17:26.991 --> 17:30.606
Your friend's been in the bathroom
for a really long time.

17:34.446 --> 17:36.589
Daisy, it's me. It's Jay.

17:38.255 --> 17:41.674
- There's no flusher.
- She's a first-time flyer.

17:41.774 --> 17:43.371
There is, honey.
It's just a little different than usual.

17:43.471 --> 17:45.483
You see the button in the wall
above the seat?

17:45.583 --> 17:47.317
It's actually a lever.

17:48.238 --> 17:51.051
- Yeah, push that.
- It says "flush" right on it.

17:51.151 --> 17:53.425
But the letters are worn off.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.734
Anyway, just push it.

18:02.863 --> 18:05.810
- It was really loud.
- You handled it well, though.

18:07.567 --> 18:09.649
Let's try and get some sleep, okay?

18:10.030 --> 18:11.604
I'm not sleepy.

18:12.206 --> 18:15.501
- Then eat your peanuts.
- I already did.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.423
Then eat mine.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.139
I already did.

18:22.094 --> 18:25.003
This flight's called a red eye.
Do you know why?

18:25.103 --> 18:29.578
Because if we don't get sleep, we're gonna
have red eyes when we get to New Orleans.

18:29.678 --> 18:32.621
And you don't want red eyes
when you meet my family, do you?

18:34.062 --> 18:35.083
- No.
- No!

18:35.919 --> 18:37.301
So, let's be quiet.

18:55.086 --> 18:56.075
I'm sorry.

18:56.175 --> 18:57.578
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.379
We have another problem.

19:04.942 --> 19:08.522
- Let's go, hon. You can't sit here.
- But the seats are too small back there.

19:08.622 --> 19:10.506
I know, but we didn't pay
for the big seats.

19:10.606 --> 19:12.747
- Can we pay for them now?
- No, we can't pay for them now.

19:12.847 --> 19:13.994
What's wrong with her?

19:14.094 --> 19:17.418
Excuse me. There's nothing wrong
with my girlfriend. Thank you.

19:17.518 --> 19:19.498
Let's go, hon. I'm lonely back there.

19:19.598 --> 19:21.834
- Do we have to sleep?
- No, we don't have to sleep.

19:21.934 --> 19:23.754
Can we get some of those good nuts
in the nice dish?

19:23.854 --> 19:25.557
Take mine.

19:26.703 --> 19:28.660
I already did.

19:39.791 --> 19:41.718
Everyone's moving around.

19:43.823 --> 19:45.839
We're getting ready to land.

19:49.870 --> 19:51.696
Before...

19:52.398 --> 19:54.707
you called me your girlfriend.

19:56.559 --> 19:58.673
Am I really your girlfriend?

20:00.814 --> 20:03.024
Yeah, you're my girlfriend.

20:09.358 --> 20:13.105
My mother told me I would never be
anybody's girlfriend.

20:17.902 --> 20:19.788
I guess she was wrong, then.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.824
- I think I'm just gonna stay out here.
- You'll be okay.

21:04.321 --> 21:06.441
You'll be okay. Come on.

21:10.735 --> 21:13.450
So, let's move Consuela
to the family table

21:13.550 --> 21:15.860
because the wedding party
will be somewhere else.

21:17.614 --> 21:18.794
Hey, Mom.

21:18.894 --> 21:21.685
You're really here.

21:24.178 --> 21:27.223
Okay. Okay. Okay.

21:27.342 --> 21:30.218
- Mom, this is Daisy.
- Hello.

21:30.318 --> 21:32.170
- Hi.
- Welcome.

21:32.270 --> 21:36.399
Oh, my. What a cute skirt.
Oh, you have no shoes on.

21:36.590 --> 21:39.146
Oh, God, Mom. We are really beat.

21:39.246 --> 21:42.571
Of course. Look at me.
I'll have Mary bring up your things.

21:42.671 --> 21:45.386
- We don't really have any things.
- Your luggage?

21:45.486 --> 21:47.594
Yeah, we traveled light.

21:47.694 --> 21:50.186
- I can always pick you up a suit.
- Great.

21:50.286 --> 21:53.322
And remember, this is the South,
so you'll have two rooms.

21:53.422 --> 21:55.690
I wouldn't stay
in the same room with a man.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.645
Yeah, we haven't... We aren't...

22:05.230 --> 22:08.526
You'll be sleeping
in Marie Antoinette's bed.

22:08.910 --> 22:12.650
Oh, no. That's okay. She can have it.
I'll just sleep on the floor.

22:12.750 --> 22:15.244
You are so funny.

22:15.696 --> 22:19.092
No, darling. Jay will have his room
and you can stay in the guest room.

23:08.398 --> 23:09.387
I thought you quit.

23:11.566 --> 23:12.813
I did.

23:18.671 --> 23:20.836
We haven't heard from you
in a long time.

23:29.038 --> 23:31.914
So, when am I gonna meet
this new girlfriend of yours?

23:32.014 --> 23:33.803
At dinner.

23:34.862 --> 23:37.803
- Your mother says she's very beautiful.
- She is.

23:38.190 --> 23:39.726
Yeah, she's very beautiful.

23:40.302 --> 23:42.643
She's got me rethinking my future.

23:47.598 --> 23:49.999
Come on. I want to show you something.

23:57.262 --> 23:58.921
Wow!

23:59.054 --> 24:01.232
It's the American dream on four wheels.

24:01.934 --> 24:06.031
- It's even got a china cabinet.
- China cabinet? Really?

24:06.254 --> 24:09.554
There's only two others in
decent condition in the whole country.

24:10.190 --> 24:12.333
And I practically stole it.

24:13.454 --> 24:15.187
Hey, it's good to be king.

24:16.271 --> 24:18.001
You're damn right it is.

24:19.662 --> 24:21.390
Time for a drink.

24:26.958 --> 24:28.778
Mom said you were coming,
but I didn't believe it.

24:28.878 --> 24:30.026
I'm here. How you doing?

24:30.126 --> 24:31.978
- Good. Good. I'll grab Kate.
- Okay.

24:32.078 --> 24:35.660
- I don't suppose you're on the wagon.
- No, not unless there's booze on it.

24:37.678 --> 24:39.923
- Well, to Jerry.
- To Jerry.

24:41.839 --> 24:43.537
So, where is this girl?

24:44.142 --> 24:46.800
She's coming down in a bit.
She's a bit shy.

24:50.958 --> 24:52.046
Here she is.

24:53.358 --> 24:54.378
I'm a nurse.

24:54.478 --> 24:57.898
Well, that's great because I'm actually
coming down with something, I think.

24:57.998 --> 25:01.066
- Dad, this is Daisy.
- Oh, call me Jason.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.736
This is my son Jerry, the groom.

25:02.836 --> 25:03.978
- Hi.
- Hello.

25:04.078 --> 25:06.506
- And this is...
- Kate. I've heard so much about you, Jay.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.866
- Well, it's all true.
- I'm Daisy. I'm a nurse.

25:09.966 --> 25:12.750
Well, thank y'all so much for coming.
It was such a surprise.

25:13.014 --> 25:15.658
- Jerry said you met at a hospital.
- We did. It's a great story.

25:15.758 --> 25:18.346
- We met at a hospital where I'm a nurse.
- I think they got that part, hon.

25:18.446 --> 25:20.202
Did you tell them
about the part where you saved me

25:20.302 --> 25:21.930
from a doctor
who wasn't really a doctor?

25:22.030 --> 25:24.610
Oh, God. Never date a doctor.
They're so emotionally remote.

25:24.710 --> 25:27.185
- You dated a doctor?
- No, I read an article about it.

25:27.982 --> 25:31.626
God, you're so skinny!
I can see your bones.

25:31.726 --> 25:33.199
Thank you.

25:42.990 --> 25:45.485
You okay? Good.

25:51.662 --> 25:55.723
Oh, my God.
That's like drinking perfume.

25:56.174 --> 25:57.490
Well, that's pretty much what it costs.

25:58.766 --> 25:59.787
Have all you want, darling.

26:02.254 --> 26:04.211
I'd like to make a toast...

26:06.766 --> 26:07.978
to Jerry and Kate.

26:08.078 --> 26:11.242
Kate, we are so proud and grateful

26:11.342 --> 26:13.770
to welcome you
as a member of the family.

26:13.870 --> 26:18.514
And I just want to wish you both all of
the happiness that money cannot buy.

26:19.470 --> 26:20.458
Cheers.

26:20.558 --> 26:22.387
- Cheers.
- To Jerry and Kate.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.554
- Cheers.
- To Jerry and Kate.

26:33.678 --> 26:35.589
There you go.

26:40.910 --> 26:43.853
- I can't eat this.
- Why not?

26:45.582 --> 26:47.730
I think it's Fancy Feast.

26:48.750 --> 26:50.314
- That's cat food.
- No, I got that.

26:50.414 --> 26:52.398
I got that. I know what you meant.

26:52.686 --> 26:54.061
Are you gonna eat it?

26:54.958 --> 26:58.445
- Actually, it's Jerry's favorite.
- Not really.

26:58.926 --> 27:01.642
They force-feed the goose
so its liver distends.

27:01.742 --> 27:04.406
I saw a documentary about it.
I literally cried.

27:06.830 --> 27:09.517
Okay, that's it.
Bring in the goddamn salads!

27:13.070 --> 27:15.018
So, tell us about this new job of yours.

27:16.174 --> 27:18.540
It's nothing glamorous.
Just hospital administration.

27:19.214 --> 27:21.589
Well, at least
you're not mopping floors.

27:22.958 --> 27:24.938
Actually, Dad, I'm looking
into some new business ventures.

27:25.038 --> 27:27.242
Really, Jay? That's wonderful.

27:27.342 --> 27:28.970
Really? What kind of ventures?

27:29.070 --> 27:31.347
Sports and entertainment, mostly,
new gaming applications.

27:31.918 --> 27:32.939
What does that mean?

27:33.774 --> 27:38.291
I'm interested in a little start-up that has
an app for placing bets in real time.

27:38.894 --> 27:40.170
Gambling.

27:40.653 --> 27:42.954
Well, so much for your MBA.

27:43.054 --> 27:45.162
Capitalism is based on gambling,
isn't it, Dad?

27:45.262 --> 27:46.763
It sounds interesting.

27:47.310 --> 27:49.706
He's also involved in a dance club.

27:49.806 --> 27:52.746
- You invested in a club?
- I don't want to bore everyone with that.

27:52.846 --> 27:55.658
But at some point, Dad, I would like
to sit down and talk more about this.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.260
So, you came back for money.

27:57.774 --> 28:01.106
No, I didn't come back for money. I came
back to see my little brother get married.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.650
But you're the one that taught me to always
be looking for new opportunities.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.099
You had every opportunity
in the world when you were here,

28:07.199 --> 28:09.352
- except for you decided to...
- Jason.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.546
I also taught you to have a plan.

28:15.534 --> 28:19.913
He actually does have a plan, Jason,
and it's a very good one.

28:20.013 --> 28:22.559
We just can't talk about it right now.

28:23.086 --> 28:24.075
You're a part of this?

28:25.006 --> 28:26.159
Yes.

28:27.406 --> 28:30.762
Well, then, let's talk about it later.

28:32.430 --> 28:33.550
Yes, let's.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.685
- I've never had champagne before.
- Yeah, I kind of figured that.

28:46.094 --> 28:48.330
You did great, by the way.
Everyone really liked you.

28:48.430 --> 28:50.447
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they did.

28:57.101 --> 28:58.812
I'll see you in the morning.

28:58.912 --> 29:00.727
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:13.198 --> 29:15.729
Honey? She's cleaning the bathroom.

29:16.366 --> 29:18.858
- Who?
- Daisy.

29:18.958 --> 29:22.126
- So?
- She's cleaning our bathroom.

29:32.013 --> 29:33.054
Hey, there.

29:33.154 --> 29:35.229
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:37.069 --> 29:38.861
Where'd you get those?

29:39.726 --> 29:43.244
In this box in the closet marked "Jay."

29:45.518 --> 29:47.728
Why are you cleaning the bathroom?

29:48.462 --> 29:52.170
I clean. That's what I do.

29:52.270 --> 29:56.366
I did all the cooking
and the cleaning for my mother.

29:57.102 --> 29:59.282
Hey, give me that.

30:01.038 --> 30:02.605
Listen.

30:03.630 --> 30:07.196
You don't have to do
any of that here. Okay?

30:08.782 --> 30:11.310
My mother said
that this is how you earn love.

30:16.781 --> 30:18.798
I thought you didn't have any family.

30:19.758 --> 30:21.395
I don't.

30:22.638 --> 30:23.660
She's dead.

30:27.758 --> 30:30.860
I'm sorry, but your mother didn't know
what the hell she was talking about.

30:32.558 --> 30:34.419
You just love people
'cause you love them,

30:35.118 --> 30:36.643
and that's it.

30:43.374 --> 30:45.037
What?

30:50.541 --> 30:53.502
My mother is dead...

30:55.022 --> 30:56.467
because I killed her.

31:02.638 --> 31:03.987
I killed her.

31:04.910 --> 31:07.186
That's why they put me in the hospital.

31:37.806 --> 31:38.827
Oh, my.

31:40.494 --> 31:43.978
It doesn't really cover up everything
that it's supposed to.

31:44.078 --> 31:46.965
- Well, it's barely a dress at all.
- Jay borrowed it from a stripper.

31:47.758 --> 31:49.357
You're probably not joking, are you?

31:50.702 --> 31:52.107
Come.

32:04.846 --> 32:09.743
I've kept every dress I've ever worn
knowing they would come in handy some day.

32:14.638 --> 32:16.464
You're gorgeous.

32:17.901 --> 32:19.664
Can we play a little bit?

32:23.917 --> 32:26.030
I think this one would be
very pretty with your skin.

32:29.454 --> 32:31.541
Sorry to keep you waiting, boys.

32:32.557 --> 32:34.836
We needed a little extra girl time.

32:52.717 --> 32:54.034
Wow.

33:27.598 --> 33:28.619
Here.

33:28.910 --> 33:30.449
You're dropping them.

33:31.854 --> 33:33.419
That's the point.

33:35.405 --> 33:37.641
No, come on. Sit.

33:37.741 --> 33:39.503
Continue. Continue on.

33:40.046 --> 33:43.982
Okay. We're gonna sit, we're gonna watch,
and we're gonna clap when it's over.

33:44.270 --> 33:46.314
- Okay?
- Okay.

34:07.374 --> 34:09.290
I've been thinking
about what you said last night.

34:09.389 --> 34:10.702
What did I say?

34:10.989 --> 34:13.549
You know, I don't take any pleasure
in watching you struggle.

34:14.029 --> 34:15.688
I am not struggling, Dad.

34:15.789 --> 34:19.434
Throwing money at a start-up
is like throwing darts at a mosquito.

34:19.534 --> 34:22.025
You think the guys
at Mac and Amazon feel that way?

34:22.126 --> 34:25.161
For every one of those breakthroughs,
there's a thousand failures.

34:25.262 --> 34:27.434
Everybody thinks he's gonna be
the exception to the rule.

34:27.534 --> 34:29.481
Dad, I've done my research.

34:29.581 --> 34:31.945
This company I'm talking about
has got sound fundamentals,

34:32.045 --> 34:35.020
it's well capitalized,
and it's got an excellent board.

34:36.014 --> 34:37.101
How much are you looking for?

34:38.572 --> 34:40.947
Thirty-five to forty grand
will get us in the door.

34:42.253 --> 34:43.146
More photos.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.869
So, how long have you been with Jay?

35:18.989 --> 35:20.330
Three days.

35:20.430 --> 35:23.407
And he's brought you home
to meet the family?

35:25.613 --> 35:27.028
We have a plan.

35:28.141 --> 35:30.058
Impressive.

35:30.349 --> 35:32.714
We had a little thing eons ago.

35:32.814 --> 35:34.545
Oh, my God. So did we.

35:36.717 --> 35:41.397
Just a little advice. He gets a stiffy
for every pretty girl he sees.

35:46.541 --> 35:48.394
And what do you do, dear?

35:48.718 --> 35:50.889
- I'm a nurse.
- A nurse!

35:50.989 --> 35:53.451
Lou, show her that thing on your back.

35:53.741 --> 35:55.721
Such lovely families.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.993
I'd love to have
their combined net worth.

35:58.093 --> 36:01.641
You can tell Wheeler's still pissed off
about that Hoffman scandal.

36:01.741 --> 36:06.317
- I think it is a shame about his older boy.
- Still, the pair of balls that kid had.

36:06.573 --> 36:08.745
While Wheeler's closing
the deal with Hoffman,

36:08.845 --> 36:13.264
the kid is upstairs screwing the wife.
You can't make that stuff up.

36:15.277 --> 36:16.528
Thank you.

36:21.101 --> 36:23.557
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Hey.

36:23.917 --> 36:26.956
- Can we dance now?
- You want to dance?

36:28.335 --> 36:30.638
Okay, okay. Let's dance.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.247
Where did you learn how to do that?

36:56.045 --> 36:57.836
VH1.

37:06.413 --> 37:07.696
It's okay. Relax.

37:13.069 --> 37:15.022
You can grab hold of me anytime.

37:15.821 --> 37:18.285
I've never grabbed anyone before.

37:19.278 --> 37:21.587
I've never even danced with anyone.

37:22.413 --> 37:25.034
Come on, what about
school dances growing up?

37:25.134 --> 37:26.773
I didn't go to school.

37:27.597 --> 37:29.141
Are you kidding?

37:29.453 --> 37:31.435
I don't think I'm kidding.

37:32.525 --> 37:34.801
That's why no one can understand me.

37:35.565 --> 37:36.554
What about me?

37:38.382 --> 37:40.819
I don't think
they understand you, either.

38:01.197 --> 38:05.329
May I borrow him?
A mother doesn't get many chances.

38:10.285 --> 38:11.274
May I?

38:17.230 --> 38:22.030
Well, I got to hand it to Jay.
You're just... not what I expected.

38:24.269 --> 38:26.161
Where did you guys meet?

38:26.381 --> 38:28.242
The hospital.

38:29.614 --> 38:32.687
Daisy, Jay wouldn't be working
at a hospital unless there was a catch.

38:33.581 --> 38:35.945
- Catch?
- Yes, a catch.

38:36.045 --> 38:37.547
And you know the catch.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.201
- I do?
- Yeah.

38:40.301 --> 38:43.113
You know, I can't help him
unless I know the truth.

38:43.533 --> 38:45.461
What's he really doing in L.A.?

38:47.981 --> 38:51.791
- I'm not lying.
- I just want the truth, Daisy.

38:55.949 --> 38:57.934
I can't talk anymore.

38:58.606 --> 38:59.793
Daisy, who are you?

39:06.669 --> 39:09.289
- What's happening?
- Something's wrong with her.

39:09.389 --> 39:11.625
- It's okay. She's fine.
- She's not fine.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.162
She's fine.
She's had too much champagne.

39:13.262 --> 39:14.601
- She needs some air.
- Let's get her outside.

39:14.701 --> 39:17.459
I got it. Go back to your dance.
Come on. Come on.

39:24.078 --> 39:25.353
You need to get her to a doctor.

39:25.453 --> 39:27.689
- She's fine, Dad.
- Jay, look at her.

39:27.789 --> 39:29.810
If you don't take her, we will.

39:30.925 --> 39:31.913
Who is she, Jay?

39:32.013 --> 39:33.545
It's not what you think, Dad.
Leave it alone.

39:33.645 --> 39:37.426
- It's obviously much worse than I think.
- Honey, what is it?

39:39.085 --> 39:41.514
I'm a janitor in a mental hospital.

39:41.997 --> 39:45.199
It's part of my probation.
She's a patient.

39:48.461 --> 39:50.217
- That's perfect.
- Yeah, it's perfect.

39:50.317 --> 39:51.951
You okay?

39:52.557 --> 39:54.157
This belongs to you.

39:55.085 --> 39:56.835
You keep it, honey.

39:56.974 --> 39:58.057
You keep it.

39:58.157 --> 40:00.937
Keep it? I gave that necklace to you!

40:01.037 --> 40:02.313
Jason, I want her to have it.

40:02.413 --> 40:04.585
But I gave it to you.
It was an anniversary gift.

40:04.685 --> 40:05.674
It doesn't matter!

40:07.533 --> 40:09.417
Leave it alone, Dad! Leave it alone!

40:09.517 --> 40:11.883
Stop!

40:15.501 --> 40:18.350
- Take it, Mom.
- Oh, good.

40:37.261 --> 40:39.502
Are we done with the plan now?

40:41.709 --> 40:43.329
Yeah, we're done.

40:49.485 --> 40:51.791
There's got to be keys in one of these.

40:52.141 --> 40:54.153
Why can't we just fly back on the plane?

40:54.253 --> 40:58.193
Because I violated my probation,
and you're an escaped mental patient.

40:58.445 --> 41:00.521
- Is that bad?
- Yeah, that's bad.

41:00.621 --> 41:03.150
I'm sure they're gonna be
looking for us by now.

41:09.613 --> 41:11.661
What about this big shiny one?

41:36.013 --> 41:37.651
Come on.

41:39.694 --> 41:41.391
God damn it.

41:47.501 --> 41:49.166
Yes.

42:04.269 --> 42:07.152
Look! These stick to the wall!

42:11.117 --> 42:12.777
Oh, my God.

42:17.709 --> 42:19.854
There's no water in the toilet.

42:20.429 --> 42:22.033
What?

42:34.829 --> 42:37.039
Stay here. I got to make a phone call.

42:39.117 --> 42:40.525
Here.

42:41.901 --> 42:43.686
I don't need any money.

42:44.845 --> 42:46.990
There's some vending machines
over there.

42:49.837 --> 42:51.590
Here. Take it.

42:53.741 --> 42:54.959
Take it.

43:02.701 --> 43:03.887
It's not gonna be long?

43:05.293 --> 43:07.364
No, it's not gonna be too long.

43:53.933 --> 43:58.385
I'm telling you. She is a classic, okay?
She really belongs in a museum.

43:58.925 --> 44:00.307
What's the catch?

44:01.357 --> 44:03.213
I can't remember where I put the title.

44:25.805 --> 44:29.425
Excuse me, Miss, but is there
something I can help you with?

44:33.293 --> 44:36.137
My boyfriend
is just making a phone call,

44:36.237 --> 44:38.768
so it shouldn't be long.

44:38.957 --> 44:40.524
How come you got no shoes?

44:41.293 --> 44:44.205
There's a rule here in the station.
You got to have shoes.

44:46.509 --> 44:49.353
It's not like I'm gonna
turn you in or anything.

44:49.453 --> 44:51.860
I was just worried
maybe your feet might get cold.

44:54.253 --> 44:57.452
Last call for the H40 to New Orleans.

44:58.285 --> 45:00.769
Are you sure you're okay, baby?

45:02.669 --> 45:06.705
Okay. I'll be right over there.
If you need any help, let me know, okay?

45:09.836 --> 45:11.024
Wheeler, where are you?

45:11.725 --> 45:14.797
I'd say somewhere
between screwed and totally fucked.

45:15.277 --> 45:18.665
- Yeah, no kidding. Mr. Frakel...
- Frakel's an evil liar.

45:18.765 --> 45:21.289
I saved her from him.
Just ask Mrs. Nealberry.

45:21.389 --> 45:25.774
Mrs. Nealberry thinks she's in planetary
orbit and that I am from Alpha Centauri.

45:26.093 --> 45:28.916
Now, tell me where Miss Kensington is
before you make this worse for yourself.

45:29.549 --> 45:31.278
She's okay. She's safe. She's fine.

45:31.661 --> 45:36.847
She is not fine. She is quite possibly
psychotic or schizophrenic.

45:37.420 --> 45:39.977
I don't know, Doc. I haven't seen her
talking to anyone who's not there

45:40.077 --> 45:42.409
- or anything like that.
- Listen to me, Wheeler.

45:42.509 --> 45:45.833
This girl has spent virtually her
entire life locked inside the house.

45:45.933 --> 45:51.529
Her social awareness, her ability to cope
are almost certainly severely impaired.

45:51.629 --> 45:55.912
Besides the occasional panic attack and not
liking shoes, she's highly functional.

45:56.012 --> 45:58.344
I'm actually thinking
it's a little post-traumatic stress.

45:58.444 --> 46:01.331
Are you kidding me?
You are not a doctor!

46:03.021 --> 46:05.801
She's at the Greyhound bus station
in Shreveport, okay?

46:05.901 --> 46:08.336
- That's in Louisiana.
- Wheeler, you can't...

46:29.901 --> 46:31.846
God damn it!

46:51.629 --> 46:53.897
Can you help me get home?

46:53.997 --> 46:58.409
Oh, baby, well,
that depends upon where home is.

46:58.509 --> 47:00.280
Where do you want to go?

47:10.765 --> 47:12.336
No more phone calls?

47:13.364 --> 47:14.674
No.

47:15.277 --> 47:17.269
No more phone calls.

47:56.109 --> 47:59.183
You go inside and get a few things.
I'm gonna be outside having a smoke.

47:59.283 --> 48:00.553
Here.

48:01.324 --> 48:02.797
Take this.

48:03.021 --> 48:04.329
There you go.

48:04.429 --> 48:08.364
And... take some money.

48:08.941 --> 48:12.363
Go ahead. Get whatever you want. Go on.

48:13.517 --> 48:15.104
There you go.

48:44.780 --> 48:46.993
Nine items or less.

48:47.693 --> 48:50.924
- I don't understand.
- You can only have nine items.

48:51.596 --> 48:54.313
- But I need all of this.
- Then you're in the wrong line.

48:54.413 --> 48:56.881
- We got to go. Come on.
- What?

49:01.004 --> 49:03.112
My mother never let me go shopping.

49:03.212 --> 49:05.577
I can cook, but I just don't know
how to pick things.

49:05.677 --> 49:07.785
I was really excited
about those powdered doughnuts!

49:07.885 --> 49:08.680
Hey!

49:08.780 --> 49:10.281
I think that police officer
is talking to us.

49:10.381 --> 49:12.434
I get that. Thank you.

49:35.117 --> 49:37.257
- There's a thing.
- Yep. Got it.

49:37.357 --> 49:38.575
Everything's fine.

49:50.508 --> 49:52.556
I think that police officer's
following us.

49:53.036 --> 49:54.353
Yeah, thank you. I see that.

50:04.268 --> 50:05.971
He's still following!

50:08.877 --> 50:12.177
- He's getting closer.
- I see. Thank you.

50:19.820 --> 50:22.012
He's even closer!

50:28.173 --> 50:29.260
Hold on to something!

50:39.884 --> 50:41.166
We lost him!

50:46.477 --> 50:48.044
Oh, shit.

51:03.276 --> 51:05.656
You're gonna have to drive for a while.

51:06.221 --> 51:07.444
I don't know how to drive.

51:09.450 --> 51:10.250
Right.

51:10.350 --> 51:13.243
My mom said that driving
gets you pregnant.

51:14.573 --> 51:16.817
Your mother told you
a lot of crazy-ass shit, didn't she?

51:19.788 --> 51:21.219
Sorry.

51:23.020 --> 51:26.192
My mom did tell me
a lot of crazy-ass shit.

51:30.285 --> 51:32.142
But she let me watch TV.

51:32.621 --> 51:36.745
But just "TV Land" and CMT,
stuff like that.

51:36.845 --> 51:39.627
She didn't like
any of the other channels.

51:41.868 --> 51:44.137
If you never went to school,
how'd you learn to read and stuff?

51:44.237 --> 51:45.745
She taught me.

51:46.284 --> 51:48.779
That was mostly so we could play
Scrabble 'cause she loved it.

51:49.772 --> 51:51.817
Except you had to let her win.

51:52.621 --> 51:55.052
Always let her win.

51:59.244 --> 52:02.000
If I'm gonna drive solo,
I got to sleep for a few hours.

52:02.573 --> 52:04.456
But just a few hours,
then you got to wake me up, okay?

52:04.556 --> 52:07.440
- Okay. Yeah, I can do that.
- Okay.

52:15.276 --> 52:17.324
What? Hi. What?

52:17.517 --> 52:19.981
You make funny noises when you sleep.

52:20.492 --> 52:23.344
- Really?
- Kind of like...

52:33.901 --> 52:36.194
And there's a cop outside.

52:36.588 --> 52:40.235
- What? Why didn't you wake me up?
- I did right now. You're up.

52:43.820 --> 52:45.608
- Are we in trouble?
- No, I'm in trouble.

52:45.708 --> 52:47.241
That guy's gonna throw
my sorry ass in jail.

52:47.341 --> 52:50.125
- Maybe we can ask him not to.
- What?

52:56.652 --> 52:58.114
Fuck.

53:08.396 --> 53:10.312
My boyfriend ran that way
when he saw your lights

53:10.412 --> 53:12.938
'cause he thinks you're gonna
throw his sorry ass in jail.

53:13.676 --> 53:15.467
All right, ma'am.

53:15.948 --> 53:17.546
I need you to step out of the vehicle.

53:19.725 --> 53:21.641
Actually,
I think I'd rather stay inside.

53:21.741 --> 53:22.633
Ma'am?

53:36.397 --> 53:40.075
There's no water in the toilet,
so we can't flush.

53:40.300 --> 53:42.445
Lord, have mercy.

53:50.732 --> 53:52.393
What's your boyfriend's name?

53:53.485 --> 53:55.729
- His name?
- Yeah, his name.

53:56.940 --> 53:58.664
Beaver.

53:58.764 --> 54:00.081
Did you say Beaver?

54:01.484 --> 54:02.731
Beaver.

54:05.996 --> 54:07.566
Beaver was my daddy's name.

54:08.620 --> 54:10.131
Really?

54:12.332 --> 54:14.666
Get back in the vehicle.

54:27.116 --> 54:30.411
Hey, he went out in the woods to go
look for you. I'll be right back.

54:49.932 --> 54:52.520
- What did you do?
- I threw his keys away.

54:52.620 --> 54:53.576
Why?

54:53.676 --> 54:55.850
'Cause if you go to jail,
we can't be together.

54:57.452 --> 54:59.251
You are hardcore.

54:59.884 --> 55:02.509
- I am?
- Yeah. Let's get out of here.

55:31.853 --> 55:33.586
I'm so hungry.

55:34.540 --> 55:35.758
Yeah, me too.

55:37.356 --> 55:39.376
And I have to go big potty.

55:43.181 --> 55:44.776
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

55:44.876 --> 55:46.409
- How are you?
- Come on over.

55:46.509 --> 55:48.232
- I'm Dave Walachowski.
- I'm Jay.

55:48.332 --> 55:50.088
- My girlfriend, Daisy.
- Daisy.

55:50.188 --> 55:52.744
- Our bathroom is broken.
- You want to use ours?

55:52.844 --> 55:55.785
Go ahead.
Then come on and join us by the fire.

56:01.036 --> 56:03.179
So, where you headed, Jay?

56:03.372 --> 56:06.024
- Los Angeles.
- So are we!

56:06.124 --> 56:08.052
We're going to Hollywood
to see Howie Mandel.

56:09.164 --> 56:10.926
Deal or no deal?

56:13.548 --> 56:15.955
Deal... or no deal?

56:17.452 --> 56:18.472
Deal?

56:18.572 --> 56:19.880
God, I love that show.

56:19.980 --> 56:22.473
- Plus, we're gonna get to see her mom.
- She has dementia.

56:24.172 --> 56:26.315
Time to put this one to bed.

56:29.740 --> 56:30.921
She's such an angel.

56:31.021 --> 56:34.224
When she's asleep, yeah. The moment
she wakes up, she's the devil.

56:35.821 --> 56:37.835
You'll have one someday and you'll see.

56:41.708 --> 56:43.675
All right, lovie.

56:46.893 --> 56:50.254
We should probably hit the sack.
It's getting late.

56:50.829 --> 56:52.297
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

56:52.397 --> 56:53.582
Appreciate it.

57:11.084 --> 57:12.585
Hey.

57:23.469 --> 57:25.898
You've been thinking about having
sex with me, haven't you?

57:33.036 --> 57:34.669
It's okay.

57:41.644 --> 57:42.633
I'm a virgin.

57:47.180 --> 57:48.868
I thought so.

57:49.324 --> 57:51.251
Can I ask you something?

57:52.396 --> 57:53.516
Yeah, sure.

57:54.412 --> 57:56.427
Did you really have sex
with somebody's wife?

57:59.853 --> 58:02.408
Who told you about that?

58:02.508 --> 58:04.712
Some people at the wedding.

58:04.812 --> 58:06.673
He said something about your balls, too.

58:07.376 --> 58:09.226
Okay.

58:10.252 --> 58:12.114
Did you have sex with somebody's wife?

58:15.756 --> 58:17.293
Yeah, I did.

58:17.772 --> 58:19.885
Is that why your dad is so mad at you?

58:22.893 --> 58:25.651
He's got so many reasons.

58:27.276 --> 58:30.158
- But, yeah.
- Who was she?

58:32.940 --> 58:36.075
She was the wife of a man who could
have made my family a lot of money.

58:37.100 --> 58:41.164
She also happened to be
very beautiful and very lonely.

58:41.452 --> 58:42.762
Did you love her?

58:47.948 --> 58:49.745
You know you're the only one
that's ever asked me that?

58:53.836 --> 58:55.708
I don't know.

59:00.493 --> 59:04.109
I don't know, basic human emotions
are not my strong suit.

59:16.204 --> 59:17.261
Good night.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.855
This is...

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.265
the best day of my life.

01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:49.769
Do we have to go back?
Can't we just go somewhere else?

01:01:50.316 --> 01:01:54.122
- I'm in a lot of trouble, Daisy.
- That's why we shouldn't go back.

01:01:54.797 --> 01:01:58.315
Yeah, I... I owe some people
a lot of money.

01:02:03.436 --> 01:02:05.679
If I had any money,

01:02:06.316 --> 01:02:07.404
I'd give it to you.

01:02:57.132 --> 01:02:58.861
I'm gonna teach you how to drive.

01:03:00.684 --> 01:03:02.792
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

01:03:04.812 --> 01:03:07.511
Let's recap. To start,

01:03:07.611 --> 01:03:11.869
brake, jiggle gas, go.

01:03:12.715 --> 01:03:13.737
That's easy, right?

01:03:15.276 --> 01:03:17.160
- No, that's hard.
- You'll be fine.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.436
Now drive us
to the other end of the lot.

01:03:20.268 --> 01:03:23.623
- No.
- Daisy, it's okay. I'm right here.

01:03:23.723 --> 01:03:26.864
Start, brake, jiggle gas, go.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.774
You can do this.

01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:34.664
No. No, no, no. I ca... I can't.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.324
I can't do things like other people.

01:03:37.804 --> 01:03:39.633
What do you think
you've been doing the last few days?

01:03:41.932 --> 01:03:43.095
Things.

01:03:43.916 --> 01:03:46.215
- It's only because I've been with you.
- No, it's not.

01:03:46.315 --> 01:03:48.334
You followed me out of the hospital.
You flew in a plane.

01:03:48.434 --> 01:03:51.729
You danced at a wedding.
You even outsmarted a state trooper.

01:03:52.427 --> 01:03:55.240
- He wasn't very smart.
- No, he wasn't very smart, but still.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.028
Daisy, you can do anything
in the world... anything.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.473
You just have to want to.

01:04:11.244 --> 01:04:13.516
- Where is she?
- It's okay. I'm bringing her back.

01:04:13.995 --> 01:04:16.071
Son, do you realize what you've done?

01:04:16.171 --> 01:04:18.824
I haven't done anything. She followed me
out of the hospital like a lost puppy.

01:04:18.924 --> 01:04:20.104
What was I supposed to do with her?

01:04:20.204 --> 01:04:23.464
- Contact a mental health professional.
- Didn't occur to me.

01:04:23.564 --> 01:04:25.960
At this point, I'm almost
more concerned about you.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.256
You're facing serious charges now.
You know they can find you.

01:04:29.356 --> 01:04:32.584
Doc, don't worry about that.
I'm gonna bring her back to you.

01:04:32.684 --> 01:04:34.280
Okay? I promise
I'm gonna bring her back.

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:41.992
- You said no more phone calls.
- Daisy.

01:04:43.507 --> 01:04:44.336
Daisy.

01:04:45.868 --> 01:04:48.524
Wheeler, what's happening? Wheeler?

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.715
Daisy! Brake for slow!

01:05:09.645 --> 01:05:13.930
Daisy! Hit the one on the left
and stop and talk to me!

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:18.476
Daisy! You got to brake for slow,
remember? Brake for slow!

01:05:18.764 --> 01:05:19.912
Brake for slow!

01:05:20.012 --> 01:05:23.431
You never wanted to be my boyfriend!
It was all just pretend!

01:05:23.531 --> 01:05:25.939
Yes, I did! Yes, I did! Of course I did!

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:31.113
Daisy, please! You're driving in circles!
Literally in circles!

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:35.656
Daisy, stop!
You're driving like a crazy person!

01:05:35.756 --> 01:05:38.085
I'm not a crazy person!

01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:40.193
Stop! Daisy!

01:05:49.156 --> 01:05:50.072
Daisy!

01:05:52.044 --> 01:05:53.703
Daisy!

01:05:57.836 --> 01:05:59.144
It's all right. It's all right.

01:05:59.244 --> 01:06:01.960
You okay? It's okay. It's okay.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.685
We got to get out of here. Are you okay?

01:06:15.244 --> 01:06:17.897
We don't have the money to pay for this.

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.201
Can I ask you something?

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:24.112
Did you kill your mother?

01:06:28.396 --> 01:06:29.775
Yes.

01:06:33.259 --> 01:06:35.225
Were there voices?

01:06:36.108 --> 01:06:37.358
Did voices tell you to do it?

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.460
No.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:46.128
No, the voices... they didn't tell me things.
They told my mother things.

01:06:46.988 --> 01:06:48.654
So, you don't hear voices.

01:06:51.051 --> 01:06:52.239
Your mother did?

01:06:54.412 --> 01:06:56.025
Yeah.

01:06:56.395 --> 01:06:59.338
Yeah. They used to tell her
things all the time.

01:07:00.332 --> 01:07:03.439
And sometimes
it was just silly stuff, but...

01:07:04.491 --> 01:07:06.574
mostly it was scary.

01:07:07.404 --> 01:07:08.786
That's why she yelled all the time.

01:07:10.859 --> 01:07:12.424
But...

01:07:13.227 --> 01:07:15.408
one night, she...

01:07:17.484 --> 01:07:21.802
she just screamed and screamed and...

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.559
I didn't go to her.

01:07:31.371 --> 01:07:35.660
And then when I woke up
in the morning, she was dead.

01:07:36.683 --> 01:07:38.348
Daisy,

01:07:39.093 --> 01:07:42.159
that is not you killing your mother.
That is her dying.

01:07:43.147 --> 01:07:45.927
You need to stop saying you killed
your mother because you didn't.

01:07:46.027 --> 01:07:49.839
You didn't kill her.
You didn't kill her.

01:07:50.636 --> 01:07:52.880
Why do I have to go back
to the hospital then?

01:07:57.195 --> 01:07:58.858
I never wanted to take you back.

01:08:02.316 --> 01:08:03.763
That's not real though, is it?

01:08:05.771 --> 01:08:07.774
That's just pretend.

01:08:14.251 --> 01:08:16.011
It is.

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.120
I did want to take you back.

01:08:19.466 --> 01:08:21.162
I did.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.423
But now I don't.

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:28.517
I really don't.

01:08:34.252 --> 01:08:36.460
Am I gonna have to live at the hospital?

01:08:37.194 --> 01:08:38.670
I don't know.

01:08:40.524 --> 01:08:42.452
No one's gonna know where I am.

01:08:43.756 --> 01:08:45.201
I'll know.

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.252
- You're not gonna forget?
- I'm not gonna forget.

01:09:47.499 --> 01:09:50.344
Daisy? Hey, Daisy?

01:09:50.444 --> 01:09:52.939
- Hey, Daisy? What happened?
- Daisy.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.031
- Where you been, Daisy?
- Daisy. Daisy, it's me, Mary Beth.

01:09:57.131 --> 01:09:59.244
Mary Beth Nealberry, honey.

01:10:10.827 --> 01:10:12.689
He's in the Los Angeles County jail.

01:10:22.187 --> 01:10:23.850
Jason...

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:29.553
there was a time when you were as reckless
as he is, and who bailed you out?

01:10:32.747 --> 01:10:34.604
Your father.

01:10:53.835 --> 01:10:55.921
Who posted my bail?

01:11:46.827 --> 01:11:48.199
- I'm sorry.
- I got to see her, man.

01:11:48.299 --> 01:11:49.649
I just don't see it happening.

01:11:50.987 --> 01:11:52.323
Mr. Wheeler,

01:11:52.423 --> 01:11:55.376
you have a better chance of being elected
mayor than ever getting in here again...

01:11:57.068 --> 01:11:58.253
which is to say none.

01:12:43.627 --> 01:12:45.864
Hey, what are you doing?
Get off the tracks!

01:12:51.595 --> 01:12:53.552
How we feeling today?

01:12:54.635 --> 01:12:58.983
I don't want any more pills.
I just want to see Jay.

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:03.568
- You can't, honey. He's in jail.
- No, he was here this morning.

01:13:04.331 --> 01:13:06.983
Either way,
he doesn't work here anymore.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:09.191
- I have to go then.
- No. No, Daisy.

01:13:09.291 --> 01:13:10.727
I promise I'm only gonna
leave for a little bit.

01:13:10.827 --> 01:13:11.815
You can't.

01:13:11.915 --> 01:13:14.567
It's okay 'cause I'm not crazy.
It's okay.

01:13:14.667 --> 01:13:16.103
It's all right.
You just need to calm down.

01:13:16.203 --> 01:13:20.872
No, I'm not having an attack!
I just want to see my boyfriend!

01:13:23.947 --> 01:13:25.863
- Well, that was quite a stunt.
- Yeah.

01:13:25.963 --> 01:13:27.911
- But I'm releasing you.
- You can't. I'm suicidal.

01:13:28.011 --> 01:13:29.191
- Bullshit.
- I'm serious.

01:13:29.291 --> 01:13:33.162
Then I'll put you on suicide precaution.
You'll be in a locked ward.

01:13:34.091 --> 01:13:35.304
She's not sick, Doc.

01:13:35.404 --> 01:13:37.576
The voices are not in Daisy's head.
They were in her mother's head.

01:13:41.195 --> 01:13:42.184
She told you that?

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:54.663
Dr. Bertleman?

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.460
Yes, Mr. Phelpmitter?

01:13:57.163 --> 01:14:00.046
Why won't you let Mr. Wheeler
see his Daisy?

01:14:01.131 --> 01:14:03.692
Mr. Phelpmitter, I can't discuss
another patient with you.

01:14:07.659 --> 01:14:10.408
They're holding her against her will,
aren't they?

01:14:10.508 --> 01:14:13.223
They've got a computer
with everything about you on it.

01:14:13.323 --> 01:14:15.915
They know about you and Daisy.
They know everything.

01:14:33.707 --> 01:14:39.404
Oh, look. Beautiful.
What you got? Come on.

01:14:41.867 --> 01:14:43.560
Where the hell you been?

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.456
You okay?

01:15:28.172 --> 01:15:30.129
For once in your life, don't talk.

01:15:32.012 --> 01:15:33.447
- Okay.
- That's talking.

01:15:33.547 --> 01:15:35.056
Sorry.

01:15:40.939 --> 01:15:42.439
I came to apologize.

01:15:44.843 --> 01:15:46.157
For what?

01:15:47.755 --> 01:15:50.097
You were right about Frakel.

01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:55.495
And about Daisy's mother.

01:15:55.595 --> 01:15:59.400
She was diagnosed schizophrenic
with extreme paranoia

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.290
by several doctors.

01:16:03.051 --> 01:16:05.639
It's remarkable she was able
to raise a daughter at all.

01:16:05.739 --> 01:16:09.479
- So, you can release her?
- I need to keep an eye on her.

01:16:09.579 --> 01:16:13.159
If all goes well, she'll transition
to a group home in two or three months.

01:16:13.259 --> 01:16:14.576
No, that's too long to wait.

01:16:15.595 --> 01:16:18.920
- She'll be all right.
- I wasn't talking about her.

01:16:21.451 --> 01:16:22.866
Well, there's nothing I can do.

01:16:24.235 --> 01:16:26.091
Of course there is.

01:16:28.523 --> 01:16:30.930
So, you wanted
to know about Mr. Wheeler.

01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:36.139
You like Mr. Wheeler?

01:16:38.091 --> 01:16:40.365
I don't like him. I love him.

01:16:42.539 --> 01:16:44.583
Have you ever been
in love before, Daisy?

01:16:47.445 --> 01:16:48.268
No.

01:16:49.867 --> 01:16:52.755
Then how do you know
you love Mr. Wheeler?

01:16:54.923 --> 01:16:58.442
- Have you ever been in love?
- I'd like to think so, yes.

01:16:59.595 --> 01:17:00.616
With who?

01:17:01.707 --> 01:17:02.892
I was married.

01:17:06.827 --> 01:17:08.685
And we're divorced now.

01:17:15.883 --> 01:17:17.166
You still love her.

01:17:23.211 --> 01:17:25.359
When it happens...

01:17:26.764 --> 01:17:28.592
you know it's not anything else.

01:18:01.675 --> 01:18:02.570
Thank you.

01:18:14.091 --> 01:18:17.039
They're from planet Nebulon.

01:18:18.251 --> 01:18:20.049
They're beautiful.

01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:26.251
I know you can hear me.

01:18:41.963 --> 01:18:42.952
Thank you.

01:19:34.283 --> 01:19:37.195
- What's the matter?
- You're standing on my toes.

01:19:37.387 --> 01:19:39.423
Oh, shit.

01:19:41.323 --> 01:19:42.607
Sorry.

01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:47.408
- Let's go.
- Okay.
