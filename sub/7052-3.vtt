00:16.132 --> 00:20.592
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been three months since I confessed.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.067
Go on, my son.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.379
Do...?

00:31.548 --> 00:36.417
Do you believe that God
can speak to you, Father?

00:36.586 --> 00:39.987
Of course I do. The Lord speaks
to all those who are willing to listen.

00:42.358 --> 00:44.223
What about the devil then?

00:45.995 --> 00:49.487
Do you want to confess something,
my son?

00:51.000 --> 00:56.063
I'm a good man, Father.
I... I try to be a good man.

00:56.239 --> 00:57.934
But I...

00:58.508 --> 00:59.975
I see things.

01:21.197 --> 01:23.791
I see things.

01:24.934 --> 01:29.268
I don't know why he chose me...

01:29.439 --> 01:31.999
...but it's happening again.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.989
It's happening again and I'm scared.

01:51.161 --> 01:52.822
Scared of what?

01:52.996 --> 01:55.430
Of what's going to happen on the bus.

02:34.337 --> 02:39.400
I want it to stop.
Please, I just want it to stop.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.737
Son, have you hurt someone?

03:00.396 --> 03:03.092
Son. Son, come back.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.292
Roy, I know it's you.

03:26.890 --> 03:29.290
Hey, let's go, buddy.
What's the problem?

03:34.731 --> 03:36.062
Oh, my God.

04:14.070 --> 04:17.938
The souls of the just
are in the hand of God.

04:19.242 --> 04:20.937
And no torment shall touch them.

04:21.110 --> 04:25.740
They seemed, in the view of the foolish,
to be dead.

04:25.915 --> 04:28.509
And their passing away
was thought an affliction...

04:28.685 --> 04:32.485
...and their going forth from us,
utter destruction.

04:33.122 --> 04:35.682
But they are in peace.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.915
You know, you being here, Livvy,
you did the right thing.

05:39.122 --> 05:41.886
The man betrays his country,
turning over state secrets...

05:42.058 --> 05:44.049
...and here we are
pretending he's a hero.

05:44.227 --> 05:45.751
I know. Stop.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.828
Bureau's got one black eye as it is.

05:47.997 --> 05:50.761
Last thing we need right now
is another espionage scandal.

05:51.167 --> 05:53.328
You made it through.

05:53.936 --> 05:54.994
It's over now.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.934
Did you see John's mother?
She wouldn't stop looking at me.

06:01.144 --> 06:03.738
- His mother.
- Yeah, like she was blaming me...

06:03.913 --> 06:06.541
...for what happened.
Like it was my fault he was dead.

06:06.716 --> 06:11.176
As far as John's mother knows,
her son died a hero serving his country.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.252
A hero.

06:16.159 --> 06:18.457
He used me, Charlie.

06:19.595 --> 06:22.155
And he told me he loved me.

06:23.699 --> 06:26.395
I wasn't gonna tell you this...

06:27.403 --> 06:29.200
...but he said he loved me too.

06:36.045 --> 06:37.706
Agent Dunham.

06:38.714 --> 06:40.682
Agent Francis.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.381
I need you to come with me.

06:44.420 --> 06:46.183
Thank you.

07:02.505 --> 07:06.168
- You brought your own sweetener?
- Don't be ridiculous.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.741
It's my medication.

07:08.911 --> 07:11.812
You're not on any medication, Walter.

07:12.248 --> 07:16.082
Course I am.
I've been making it myself in the lab.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.411
Oh, I wish you were joking.

07:18.588 --> 07:21.648
You're self-medicating
with homemade drugs.

07:21.824 --> 07:24.088
Simple combination
of Dextromethorphan...

07:24.260 --> 07:26.854
...Clonazepam and some Fluoxetine.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.293
Those are psychotics, Walter.

07:29.465 --> 07:30.489
All of them.

07:30.666 --> 07:33.464
Course they are. That's the point.

07:34.003 --> 07:38.337
I have been in a mental facility
for the past 17 years.

07:38.508 --> 07:41.443
It's put me quite out of balance.

07:41.611 --> 07:43.238
Right.

07:43.446 --> 07:45.971
- Stay here.
- What if I need to use the bathroom?

07:46.149 --> 07:48.845
Just hold it. I'll be right back.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.124
Hello?

08:06.636 --> 08:09.332
Hey, what are you doing?

08:09.505 --> 08:12.167
What? You thought
I didn't see you all day?

08:22.318 --> 08:24.912
You were supposed to check in
before you came home.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.556
You tell anybody else that I'm here...

08:27.723 --> 08:31.022
...you're the first one of the bunch
I'm gonna come after.

08:39.101 --> 08:42.001
It was moving, but I stopped it.

08:43.371 --> 08:46.000
There was something important.

08:47.510 --> 08:48.772
Oh.

08:49.412 --> 08:52.108
I've decided on the pancakes.

08:52.315 --> 08:53.373
Blueberry.

08:53.749 --> 08:55.011
That's great, Walter.

08:55.184 --> 08:57.675
- Did somebody call me on the phone?
- Oh!

08:58.054 --> 09:00.921
That's what was important.

09:01.090 --> 09:03.115
Something about a bus.

09:03.326 --> 09:06.454
The incident occurred
at 8:14 a.m., middle of rush hour.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.120
First responders were worried
it was bioterrorism...

09:09.332 --> 09:12.859
...ghost of the sarin subway incident
in Tokyo in 1995.

09:13.035 --> 09:14.229
They called in the CDC...

09:14.403 --> 09:18.100
...confirmed the attack isn't biological
in nature. There's no contagion.

09:18.274 --> 09:20.139
And you said
there wasn't any good news.

09:20.343 --> 09:23.471
Our team's coming in
to transfer this bus to a secure area.

09:23.646 --> 09:27.013
I want you to extend the perimeter
outside the tunnel another 50 yards.

09:33.956 --> 09:35.116
It's horrible.

09:35.291 --> 09:38.454
They're like mosquitoes
trapped in amber.

09:38.628 --> 09:41.495
If this was some sort of attack,
why not...

09:41.664 --> 09:47.660
...just use something conventional
like plastic explosives, pipe bomb?

09:47.870 --> 09:49.804
Impact.

09:51.307 --> 09:54.401
Whoever did this wanted attention.
I mean, look at that.

09:54.577 --> 09:57.410
Or it's not an attack at all,
it's something else entirely.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.605
- Meaning?
- If I knew, you wouldn't be here.

09:59.782 --> 10:04.446
I imagine that the material was released
in gaseous form before solidification.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.850
I need to study it in my lab.
Can I have some?

10:07.023 --> 10:11.392
We'll have to dig out their
personal effects so we can ID them.

10:12.295 --> 10:14.991
Notify their next of kin.

10:33.649 --> 10:34.843
It's not here.

11:36.245 --> 11:37.872
Roy?

11:38.748 --> 11:40.545
What is that?

11:47.022 --> 11:48.353
I don't know.

12:02.705 --> 12:04.764
Any idea what it is yet?

12:04.940 --> 12:07.272
Tricky, very tricky.

12:07.443 --> 12:12.073
All I've been able to discern is that
it starts as a silicon-based aerosol...

12:12.248 --> 12:14.512
...and it solidifies somehow.

12:16.786 --> 12:19.084
You could be of assistance to me.

12:19.255 --> 12:22.554
I would love to hear some Bach.

12:22.725 --> 12:24.716
Mass in A minor.

12:24.894 --> 12:26.293
Will you play it for me?

12:27.696 --> 12:31.564
I'm sure the young lady down there
would get us a piano.

12:31.734 --> 12:35.067
That young lady
is an FBI agent, Walter.

12:35.771 --> 12:37.136
Her name is Astrid...

12:37.306 --> 12:39.968
...and this is the 100th time
you've forgotten her name.

12:40.142 --> 12:42.337
So no, I don't think
I can get you a piano.

12:42.545 --> 12:45.309
You always resisted your lessons too.

12:45.481 --> 12:49.542
Lack of commitment, son,
was always your problem.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.019
I imagine that's why
you still haven't chosen a profession.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.248
I should have followed
in your footsteps...

12:55.424 --> 12:58.689
...because your work has obviously
brought such joy to the world.

13:01.297 --> 13:02.491
Who was he, Peter?

13:03.466 --> 13:06.594
- Sorry?
- The man in the restaurant.

13:07.336 --> 13:09.133
Are you in some kind of trouble?

13:10.506 --> 13:12.497
It was nothing.
He was harassing the waitress.

13:12.675 --> 13:15.166
- I just told him to cut it out.
- Oh, I see.

13:35.464 --> 13:38.729
Excuse me, can you please
extract this camera?

13:42.738 --> 13:45.036
I want you to note
all the people on this video.

13:45.207 --> 13:46.868
Cross-check them with the victims.

13:47.042 --> 13:49.067
If we're lucky,
maybe she caught whoever did...

13:49.245 --> 13:51.145
Stop, go back.

13:52.147 --> 13:53.842
Can we close in on that woman?

13:58.721 --> 14:00.848
- What is it?
- That backpack.

14:01.023 --> 14:03.389
I just saw that woman,
that backpack wasn't there.

14:03.559 --> 14:06.858
Has anyone seen a blue backpack
with the other personal effects?

14:07.029 --> 14:08.929
So someone took the bag from her...

14:09.131 --> 14:11.361
...got off the bus before the attack?

14:12.134 --> 14:14.500
So who is she?

14:18.541 --> 14:22.068
Evelina Mendoza,
she's a federal employee.

14:26.048 --> 14:27.743
What's her job?

14:27.917 --> 14:29.578
Oh, my God. She's DEA.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.252
The woman who died,
whose backpack was stolen...

14:34.423 --> 14:36.721
...she's a drug enforcement agent,
undercover.

14:36.892 --> 14:41.591
She had a handler, Grant Davidson.
I wanna bring him in for questioning.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.894
I apologize
if I wasn't helpful on the phone.

14:47.069 --> 14:50.368
I needed to ask my superiors
for clearance to talk to you about Eve.

14:50.539 --> 14:51.972
Our condolences.

14:52.174 --> 14:55.166
From her records she seemed
like an exemplary agent.

14:55.344 --> 14:57.437
Ah, she was.

14:57.613 --> 14:59.547
Can you tell us about the case
she was working on?

14:59.715 --> 15:03.583
Uh, three months ago,
she was tasked to infiltrate...

15:03.752 --> 15:07.415
...the East Coast representatives
of a Nicaraguan drug cartel.

15:07.957 --> 15:11.120
Been banging on them for over a year.
She called me...

15:11.293 --> 15:15.320
...said she wanted me to pull her out.
She was scared.

15:15.497 --> 15:19.058
Said she heard members
of the cartel...

15:19.234 --> 15:21.327
...discussing something
about the Pattern.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.164
I told her I never heard of it.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.331
And, uh, we set up a meet,
but she never showed.

15:26.842 --> 15:31.108
Whoever attacked the bus this morning
was interested in one of her effects.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.942
Do you have any idea
what she could have been carrying?

15:34.116 --> 15:36.107
I wish I could be more helpful.

15:37.820 --> 15:39.583
You have been, Agent Davidson.

15:39.755 --> 15:41.347
Thank you.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.981
I've been asked
to officially ID her body.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.424
I suppose that won't be a problem.

15:52.334 --> 15:54.768
Have you spoken with her family?

15:56.805 --> 16:00.263
Uh, there's a, uh, brother
she doesn't talk to.

16:02.144 --> 16:04.339
I didn't realize
how hard this was gonna be.

16:04.513 --> 16:05.810
You don't have to explain.

16:05.981 --> 16:09.883
I know what it's like to lose someone
you've worked with closely.

16:11.353 --> 16:13.981
I'd like to say goodbye.

16:14.156 --> 16:15.350
Of course.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.724
- Should I bother to ask?
- Heh, music helps him process.

16:52.895 --> 16:56.661
It works too. As soon as Peter started
playing, Walter just kind of locked in.

16:56.832 --> 16:59.665
He was able to re-create the material
from the crime scene.

16:59.835 --> 17:01.564
Hey.

17:02.337 --> 17:04.099
I hear you play the piano.

17:04.306 --> 17:07.275
He doesn't just play, he's good.
You should hear him.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.843
- Heh, no, maybe some other time.
- Olivia.

17:10.012 --> 17:12.776
You'll be pleased to hear
we figured it out. The material.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.915
The gas that was released
on the bus...

17:15.084 --> 17:19.042
...turned solid when it met
the nitrogen in the atmosphere.

17:19.221 --> 17:22.156
Instantly immobilizing
and suffocating the passengers.

17:23.892 --> 17:26.724
Who would have the know-how
to manufacture something like this?

17:26.895 --> 17:29.796
I'll give you six guesses,
and the first five don't count.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.159
Massive Dynamic.

17:32.534 --> 17:34.866
Three chemical companies
in the U.S. supply those compounds.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.468
All of them wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Massive Dynamic.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.233
Charlie, what's up?

17:41.410 --> 17:44.868
We got something.
I think you're gonna want to see it.

17:45.047 --> 17:48.778
Tip got called in
from a priest over at St. Anne's.

17:48.951 --> 17:51.943
Says the guy that lives here
mentioned a potential incident...

17:52.121 --> 17:54.146
...about the bus before it happened.

17:54.356 --> 17:55.789
So, what do we know about him?

17:55.958 --> 17:59.792
Name's Roy McComb,
high school graduate, no criminal record.

17:59.962 --> 18:03.659
He's been pushing papers at an escrow
company for the last couple of months.

18:03.866 --> 18:06.630
I got B.P.D. picking him up
from there right now.

18:06.802 --> 18:09.236
Doesn't seem like
the profile of a mass murderer.

18:10.773 --> 18:12.502
No.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.938
I didn't think so either.

18:16.645 --> 18:18.237
What?

18:26.622 --> 18:30.080
You're looking at depictions
of dozens of attacks...

18:30.259 --> 18:33.456
...accidents, disasters
we've seen over the last year.

18:42.938 --> 18:46.931
And look, all of them are dated
before the incidents took place.

18:52.981 --> 18:55.950
Is that the flight from Hamburg?

19:08.864 --> 19:11.025
So this guy drew Flight 627...

19:11.200 --> 19:13.566
...the Angel suicides in Baltimore...

19:13.735 --> 19:16.431
...and the Birmingham Bridge collapse?

19:16.605 --> 19:18.402
Clearly the man is disturbed.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.338
But do you really think
he could be involved in all this?

19:21.510 --> 19:24.377
No, I don't.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.514
But that doesn't make me
any less interested...

19:26.682 --> 19:28.547
...to know
where he got his information.

19:28.717 --> 19:31.277
Several of those incidents
have never been made public.

19:31.453 --> 19:34.354
Based on the evidence,
every one of them was either drawn...

19:34.523 --> 19:36.855
...or constructed
before the event depicted.

19:40.696 --> 19:45.065
Mr. McComb, I'm Special Agent
Charlie Francis of the FBI.

19:45.234 --> 19:48.465
You're not officially being charged
with anything right now.

19:48.637 --> 19:51.367
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Is that okay?

19:51.540 --> 19:54.236
Um, yeah, okay. Sure. Uh...

19:54.409 --> 19:57.105
- Call me Roy.
- Okay, Roy.

19:58.547 --> 20:01.243
Start with this drawing of yours.

20:04.052 --> 20:06.111
Fourteen different chemical compounds...

20:06.288 --> 20:08.085
...were used in the incident on the bus.

20:08.257 --> 20:11.954
Three of them manufactured
exclusively by your subsidiaries.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.389
You've done your homework.

20:13.562 --> 20:16.087
We supply them to
a dozen labs around the world.

20:16.265 --> 20:18.233
It could've been stolen
from any of them.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.265
I'll need a list of those labs, then.

20:20.435 --> 20:22.300
Of course. Anything you need.

20:23.272 --> 20:24.933
Thank you.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.107
So is there anything else?

20:31.013 --> 20:32.139
When we first met...

20:32.314 --> 20:36.341
...you said that science and technology
had advanced to such a state...

20:36.518 --> 20:40.352
...that... Your words.
- They were "running out of control."

20:40.522 --> 20:41.750
That sounds about right.

20:41.924 --> 20:46.520
Well, so far, all the science
and technology that I've come across...

20:46.695 --> 20:50.187
...has been very tightly controlled
by Massive Dynamic.

20:50.399 --> 20:53.994
Every case I investigate
has a tie back to this company.

20:54.169 --> 20:57.002
Well, I think
maybe you have it backwards.

20:57.172 --> 21:01.768
Massive Dynamic is, well,
so massive...

21:01.944 --> 21:03.536
...that just about everything...

21:03.712 --> 21:07.170
...in the world of science and technology
has a tie back to us.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.850
Of course, I could say something
of the same to you, couldn't I?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.716
You've been investigating these cases
for a short while.

21:14.923 --> 21:18.359
At least three of them have occurred
right in your own backyard.

21:18.527 --> 21:24.193
I might suspect that you, yourself,
were somehow responsible.

21:30.806 --> 21:35.243
I hope it will help you find
whoever's behind these attacks.

21:36.078 --> 21:37.739
Attacks?

21:37.946 --> 21:40.744
Apparently,
Broyles hasn't told you. Yes.

21:40.949 --> 21:43.349
The technology was used
once before, in Prague.

21:43.518 --> 21:45.315
Although there were fewer casualties.

21:45.487 --> 21:48.047
Then, I suppose if you had access
to the case files...

21:48.223 --> 21:50.123
...you'd know that
we'd already shared...

21:50.292 --> 21:53.693
...all the information we have
with the government.

21:53.862 --> 21:57.821
Thank you for the information.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.233
What about this one?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.236
This one gonna happen too, Roy?

22:08.410 --> 22:10.207
Ahem, look...

22:10.846 --> 22:16.341
...I know that this sounds crazy...

22:16.518 --> 22:18.850
In fact, I think I am crazy.

22:19.588 --> 22:25.527
- But I can be anywhere,
at home or at work...

22:25.694 --> 22:32.099
...and, uh, just all of a sudden, I get this...

22:32.267 --> 22:33.791
I don't know how to describe it.

22:34.002 --> 22:36.266
This feeling.

22:36.438 --> 22:40.431
And the only way
that I can get it out...

22:40.609 --> 22:46.309
...get rid of it,
is to try to draw what I see.

22:47.916 --> 22:50.316
Or to try to build it.
Sometimes that works.

22:50.519 --> 22:52.544
How long have you
been getting these feelings?

22:52.721 --> 22:55.952
Maybe nine months.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.551
Nine months.

23:00.295 --> 23:03.890
Roy's feelings, or whatever they are...

23:04.066 --> 23:07.126
...began roughly when we became aware
of the Pattern.

23:07.302 --> 23:10.635
- Meaning what?
- I'm not entirely sure yet...

23:10.806 --> 23:13.172
...but it's hard to say he's lying.
- He's not.

23:13.341 --> 23:16.003
I'd like to consider myself
a fairly good poker player.

23:16.178 --> 23:18.146
Which requires me
to have the ability...

23:18.313 --> 23:21.578
...to read my opponent's tells.
Know when he's bluffing.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.149
He's not bluffing.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.582
Regardless of what
the actual explanation is...

23:25.754 --> 23:28.120
...he believes that what he's saying
is the truth.

23:28.290 --> 23:29.587
What do you suggest?

23:29.758 --> 23:32.318
- How has he learned of these incidents?
- I don't know.

23:32.494 --> 23:35.156
- Hey, I just saw Charlie. He told me...
- Ockham's razor.

23:36.198 --> 23:39.326
All other things being equal,
the simplest solution is the best.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.969
- And what is that?
- The man's psychic.

23:43.071 --> 23:45.437
Theoretically, it's all quite possible.

23:45.807 --> 23:49.368
So you're saying
Roy can read people's minds.

23:49.578 --> 23:52.376
I posit that Roy
has no control over his abilities...

23:52.581 --> 23:54.845
...that he's linked psychically
with someone...

23:55.016 --> 23:57.348
...or less likely, but still possible...

23:57.519 --> 24:01.319
...a small group of people
responsible for these events.

24:01.490 --> 24:04.459
Equally possible, someone
who is merely discussing them.

24:06.194 --> 24:09.322
Perhaps he's communicating with you,
Agent Broyles.

24:11.299 --> 24:12.823
Forgive me, Dr. Bishop...

24:13.001 --> 24:17.461
...I like to think I have an open mind,
but I have a hard time accepting that...

24:17.639 --> 24:19.539
...that man is hearing
another person's thoughts.

24:19.708 --> 24:23.974
Yes, so do I, which is why
I would like to prove it.

24:24.146 --> 24:27.240
- And here we go.
- And how would you do that?

24:27.549 --> 24:29.483
Am I required to keep him alive?

24:29.651 --> 24:32.211
That would probably be best.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.621
Can we, uh, talk a moment?

24:43.832 --> 24:45.732
- Go ahead.
- Nina Sharp just told me...

24:45.901 --> 24:47.391
...this isn't the first time...

24:47.569 --> 24:49.662
...that material from the bus
has been used.

24:49.838 --> 24:53.171
I'd be skeptical of anything
coming from Nina, but in this case...

24:53.341 --> 24:55.138
...she's correct.

24:55.777 --> 24:57.574
So, what?

24:57.746 --> 25:01.079
I don't have clearance to know
background on a case I'm investigating?

25:01.249 --> 25:04.412
Agent Dunham, if I'm not always
completely transparent with you...

25:04.586 --> 25:08.386
...there's a reason. This little task force
you and I call our day job now...

25:08.557 --> 25:12.550
...it sometimes requires some, shall
we say, bureaucratic maneuvering...

25:12.727 --> 25:14.786
...to keep it alive
and free from meddling.

25:14.963 --> 25:18.694
Which means sometimes I don't tell
you everything, for your own protection.

25:19.100 --> 25:23.730
With all due respect,
that's not good enough.

25:23.905 --> 25:27.898
Now, I've been trained for a lot:
Hostage crises, terror campaigns...

25:28.076 --> 25:30.101
...suicide bombers, chemical attacks...

25:30.278 --> 25:33.577
...but the things I've seen
since I started working for you...

25:33.748 --> 25:37.809
If I'm gonna do this job, I need to know
what it is I'm dealing with.

25:37.986 --> 25:41.615
And you will. When you're ready.

25:42.991 --> 25:45.926
Till then,
I suppose you'll need to trust me.

25:50.732 --> 25:52.825
So, what are we looking for?

25:53.001 --> 25:54.764
If my hypothesis is correct...

25:54.936 --> 25:57.837
...if he is picking up the thoughts
of another human being...

25:58.073 --> 25:59.938
...it will leave a distinct signature.

26:00.108 --> 26:03.805
And you think we'll be able
to identify whose thoughts they are?

26:04.646 --> 26:06.238
That's preposterous.

26:06.514 --> 26:09.074
But I may be able to intercept them.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.316
Magnificent machine.

26:19.794 --> 26:22.285
You mind if we view the axial images?

26:31.773 --> 26:33.104
His vitals are spiking.

26:37.479 --> 26:40.277
- What's happening?
- No idea.

26:40.448 --> 26:42.541
But I'm extremely interested
to find out.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.816
Something's wrong!

26:50.325 --> 26:51.849
Shut it down now!

26:55.397 --> 26:57.228
- Get up. Are you okay?
- I don't know.

26:57.399 --> 27:01.062
- I think so. What did that?
- Something in the blood.

27:01.269 --> 27:04.727
A magnetic compound of some kind,
dormant, perhaps a parasite.

27:04.906 --> 27:06.305
What...? I don't understand.

27:06.474 --> 27:09.341
The machine is a magnet, and
you've got metal in your blood.

27:09.511 --> 27:10.910
If we hadn't turned it off...

27:11.079 --> 27:13.513
...it would've ripped your body apart.
- Quite a mess.

27:13.682 --> 27:17.174
Why would there be metal in his blood?
That's not normal, right?

27:24.893 --> 27:27.657
You wanna see everything from 1989.

27:27.829 --> 27:33.961
- Uh, hmm, no. Perhaps '79.
- Fantastic. That's very helpful.

27:36.104 --> 27:37.731
Oh, stop.

27:40.408 --> 27:42.171
I was right.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.879
Belly and I worked
on this very problem.

27:45.046 --> 27:47.514
- Belly?
- Yeah, as in William Bell.

27:47.682 --> 27:50.207
Founder of Massive Dynamic,
one of the richest men on the planet.

27:50.385 --> 27:52.046
He and Walter
used to share a lab together.

27:52.220 --> 27:55.348
Loved cloves. Awful odor.

27:55.523 --> 27:57.957
We posited a spectrum of waves...

27:58.126 --> 28:00.754
...lying outside the range of those
already discovered.

28:00.929 --> 28:04.262
We hypothesized that these waves...

28:04.432 --> 28:08.562
...could be used
to communicate information.

28:09.604 --> 28:12.095
The government, of course,
was extremely interested.

28:12.273 --> 28:17.006
It was a brilliant idea.
A theory, but a good one.

28:17.746 --> 28:23.241
They wanted to use the network to send
their most clandestine information.

28:23.418 --> 28:25.978
If no other government
knew the spectrum existed...

28:26.154 --> 28:27.781
...they couldn't listen in.
- Yes.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.948
And they called it
"The Ghost Network."

28:31.126 --> 28:33.822
But they asked us
to take it one step further:

28:34.028 --> 28:35.120
To develop a method...

28:35.296 --> 28:38.959
...where they could transmit directly
from one person to another.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.999
I surmised that I could introduce...

28:41.169 --> 28:47.733
...an iridium-based organometallic
compound into the subject's brain.

28:47.909 --> 28:50.104
You have got to be kidding me.

28:50.578 --> 28:51.602
What?

28:51.780 --> 28:54.248
Roy McComb was
one of your test subjects.

28:54.416 --> 28:58.113
Of course, yes.
That explains it, doesn't it?

28:58.620 --> 29:00.247
Explains it?

29:00.422 --> 29:02.720
Yes, that explains why
he almost died today...

29:02.891 --> 29:05.792
...because you injected something
into his brain 20 years ago.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.794
No. What I gave him was not nearly
enough to cause that reaction.

29:09.964 --> 29:12.831
The compound must have multiplied
in his bloodstream...

29:13.001 --> 29:14.263
...over time.

29:14.436 --> 29:16.028
Environment, perhaps diet.

29:16.204 --> 29:19.264
He was a sophomore volunteering
for psych experiments.

29:19.441 --> 29:22.137
Did you bother to explain to him
what you were doing?

29:22.310 --> 29:25.473
Well, it wouldn't have been
a very secret experiment if I had.

29:25.647 --> 29:26.705
What's going on?

29:26.881 --> 29:29.679
- How's Roy McComb?
- He's fine. No thanks to my father's...

29:29.851 --> 29:32.319
...attempts to turn him into
a human walkie-talkie.

29:32.487 --> 29:34.819
- Wait a second.
- Don't try and change the subject!

29:34.989 --> 29:37.150
What you just said is on subject.

29:39.027 --> 29:43.293
The iridium-based compound
that multiplied in his bloodstream...

29:43.465 --> 29:46.434
...has turned him
into some kind of receiver.

29:46.601 --> 29:49.536
- A receiver of what?
- Transmissions.

29:49.704 --> 29:53.902
Someone else, it seems...
And I'm somewhat jealous of this.

29:54.108 --> 29:56.872
Has perfected our Ghost Network...

29:57.412 --> 30:00.040
...and is using it to communicate.

30:00.215 --> 30:05.812
Our dear Roy is merely overhearing
what they say.

30:05.987 --> 30:09.855
You'll note that the rotary movement
gives the impression of a 3-D tunnel...

30:10.024 --> 30:11.355
...when, in fact, it is not.

30:11.526 --> 30:12.925
Next slide, please.

30:13.628 --> 30:15.061
That's an oldie but a goodie.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.893
As you observe this image,
your brain perceives first a duck...

30:19.067 --> 30:23.834
...a rabbit, a duck again.
It always comes back to the duck.

30:24.038 --> 30:25.528
In truth, the image is neither.

30:25.707 --> 30:28.904
But it illustrates the brain's need
to take random sensory input...

30:29.077 --> 30:31.545
...and construct it into a meaningful...
- Great.

30:31.713 --> 30:35.080
- Thank you, we get it.
- Uh, I'm sorry, I don't think I do get it.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.514
Well, neither do I.
I just want him to stop.

30:37.685 --> 30:39.448
- I'll get the lights.
- I suspect...

30:39.654 --> 30:42.020
...someone has continued my research.

30:42.290 --> 30:44.758
But they've taken the easy way out...

30:44.926 --> 30:48.885
...merely using the Ghost Network
as a secure telecommunications channel.

30:49.063 --> 30:52.260
You're suggesting Roy's listening
to someone's telephone network.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.094
Yes. But, no, not listening.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.466
Roy's brain is trying to interpret
the sensory input...

30:57.672 --> 31:01.199
...much as our brains
grapple with the duck-rabbit.

31:01.576 --> 31:05.068
I told you,
it always comes back to the duck.

31:05.246 --> 31:07.111
So, if Roy's
receiving this frequency...

31:07.282 --> 31:09.580
...is there any way
we can tap in and hear them?

31:09.751 --> 31:11.446
Or maybe even ID them?

31:11.619 --> 31:15.111
Construct a receiver using
that spectrum, it's possible, of course...

31:15.290 --> 31:16.780
...but it would take months.

31:16.958 --> 31:22.055
But it may be possible to redirect the
transmissions from his visual centers...

31:22.430 --> 31:24.091
...to his auditory cortex.

31:24.265 --> 31:26.460
Wait, you wanna rewire his brain?

31:27.268 --> 31:31.568
Not without his permission.
It would be a minor surgery.

31:31.739 --> 31:34.139
Minor brain surgery,
emphasis not on the "minor."

31:34.509 --> 31:36.670
I would need
a specific piece of equipment:

31:36.844 --> 31:39.904
A magnetic neurostimulator
I built in 1983.

31:40.081 --> 31:41.912
With a few adjustments,
it would work.

31:42.083 --> 31:44.313
We'll just go back in time
and get it for you.

31:44.485 --> 31:48.922
No need to. It's most likely
where I left it 17 years ago:

31:49.090 --> 31:51.923
Hidden in a wall
in our old house in Cambridge.

31:56.130 --> 31:58.291
Blast from the past.

32:02.470 --> 32:04.961
What's the game plan here?
We're just gonna knock...

32:05.139 --> 32:08.666
...ask if we can tear out their walls?
- Pretty much.

32:09.377 --> 32:12.778
I guess the badge is the "pretty please"
in that equation.

32:16.684 --> 32:17.878
There's no lights on.

32:18.052 --> 32:22.011
I'm gonna call in, see if we can
track down the owner for consent.

32:28.496 --> 32:29.963
What are you doing?

32:30.131 --> 32:32.998
What? This is barely even a crime.
I used to live here.

32:44.312 --> 32:46.405
Normal pupil response.

32:49.083 --> 32:52.746
Taking any medications,
prescribed or illicit?

32:52.920 --> 32:54.581
You can be truthful, I won't judge.

32:55.023 --> 32:58.390
In fact, if the answer is no,
I may encourage some drug use.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.322
No, none. Ahem.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.062
- Any food allergies?
- Not that I'm aware of.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.099
Good, good, good. This all checks out.

33:07.301 --> 33:10.498
Strap him down, I'll get started.

33:10.672 --> 33:13.334
God. Strap me down?

33:13.508 --> 33:15.373
There's nothing to be worried about.

33:15.810 --> 33:20.747
I guess, uh, I must seem pretty silly...

33:20.915 --> 33:23.281
...thinking God
was talking to me and everything.

33:23.451 --> 33:25.214
What were you supposed to think?

33:25.386 --> 33:27.946
That I was just crazy.

33:28.122 --> 33:30.215
I considered that too.

33:30.391 --> 33:34.725
It's gotta be sort of a relief, right?
Knowing there's a rational explanation?

33:35.196 --> 33:39.189
I wouldn't exactly
call any of this rational.

33:40.068 --> 33:42.696
Do you really think
that this is going to help you...

33:42.870 --> 33:45.703
...catch the guys
that killed those people on the bus?

33:45.873 --> 33:48.205
You're our best lead.

33:48.376 --> 33:50.071
No pressure, huh?

33:53.414 --> 33:56.747
Lived here when I was a kid,
but after Walter was institutionalized...

33:56.918 --> 34:00.285
...my mom couldn't afford the mortgage
so we moved to Allston.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.389
So where's your mother now?

34:02.557 --> 34:04.491
That's a story for another time.

34:04.659 --> 34:08.150
So tell me,
of all the possible career choices...

34:08.362 --> 34:11.228
...how did a girl like you
end up in law enforcement?

34:11.399 --> 34:14.766
I pretty much knew this is what
I wanted to do by the time I was 9.

34:14.936 --> 34:18.496
When I was 9 years old,
I think I wanted to be a brontosaurus.

34:20.608 --> 34:22.473
You know,
they say the psych profiles...

34:22.643 --> 34:25.110
...of cops and criminals
are pretty much identical.

34:25.279 --> 34:26.906
Ever consider a life of crime?

34:27.447 --> 34:28.608
No dental.

34:32.786 --> 34:35.813
Nothing. Of course.

34:40.561 --> 34:42.927
- Huh...
- What?

34:47.502 --> 34:50.027
My mom had this covered up.

34:50.204 --> 34:52.695
I used to hide in it all the time.

35:05.019 --> 35:07.852
You'll need to be awake
for the procedure...

35:08.156 --> 35:14.186
...but I'm going to give you
a mild sedative to reduce any anxiety.

35:15.630 --> 35:17.359
Dr. Bishop...

35:17.865 --> 35:20.163
...you look really familiar to me.

35:21.102 --> 35:22.364
Hmm.

35:22.737 --> 35:25.228
I hear that a lot.

35:26.207 --> 35:29.142
In the mental institution where I lived...

35:29.310 --> 35:31.369
He'll need a moment.

35:32.280 --> 35:35.215
Oh! You've returned.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.181
How was the old house?
How was Rufus?

35:38.352 --> 35:40.047
The house is just like we left it.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.815
But we put Rufus to sleep
almost 20 years ago, Walter.

35:42.990 --> 35:45.720
Oh. That's terrible news.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.485
We found your equipment.

36:01.542 --> 36:04.375
This brings back some memories.

36:05.746 --> 36:07.475
Of what?

36:12.787 --> 36:16.985
I think it's time
for some intracranial penetration.

36:18.092 --> 36:19.559
This won't hurt...

36:21.996 --> 36:25.090
...just feel a touch odd.

36:25.399 --> 36:26.991
Okay.

36:35.643 --> 36:37.304
Is this Poli Sci 101?

36:37.879 --> 36:39.244
Not remotely.

36:41.749 --> 36:44.582
- Who was it?
- Freshmen.

37:03.771 --> 37:08.140
I need you to keep this dial steady
at 60 hertz, 10 gauss...

37:08.309 --> 37:10.402
...until I tell you otherwise.

37:11.946 --> 37:16.440
I believe there are clusters of metal
in the visual centers of your brain.

37:16.984 --> 37:21.444
I'm going to attempt to move them
to those regions which process sound.

37:21.622 --> 37:23.590
You'll be shown a series of images.

37:24.358 --> 37:30.160
I need you to tell me any sensations
you experience as you see each image.

37:32.566 --> 37:35.797
- Sounds easy enough.
- First image, please.

37:38.706 --> 37:42.506
- It's a horse.
- Wonderful.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.769
Fifty gauss.

37:50.084 --> 37:51.312
What the hell was that?

37:51.652 --> 37:55.816
That was your body's normal
muscle responses. Perfectly natural.

37:55.990 --> 38:00.188
You may also experience
an involuntary bowel movement.

38:00.461 --> 38:01.621
Great.

38:01.796 --> 38:04.026
Next image, son.

38:05.399 --> 38:07.196
Oh, man.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.865
Oh, this is bad. Oh, this is weird.

38:11.038 --> 38:15.304
Uh, I'm... I'm tasting, uh, dirt.

38:15.743 --> 38:17.540
No, wait, it's, uh, gasoline.

38:17.712 --> 38:20.510
We've reached the gustatory cortex.
We're getting close.

38:20.982 --> 38:24.179
- Next image, please.
- I don't know. Heh.

38:24.819 --> 38:26.684
It's a beach.

38:27.054 --> 38:30.353
- Well, no sensations at all?
- I don't think so.

38:30.524 --> 38:33.891
- Well, damn it, don't you feel anything?
- I'm a little scared.

38:34.061 --> 38:36.586
I don't understand.
This should be working.

38:36.764 --> 38:39.198
Walter, take a deep breath.
It's gonna be okay.

38:39.934 --> 38:44.530
- You, increase the level to 200 gauss.
- Don't do that. Stop, I said.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.870
- What did you say?
- I don't know.

38:48.042 --> 38:49.202
I can hear voices.

38:52.246 --> 38:55.511
- I think that's Latin.
- It is. He just said, um...

38:55.683 --> 38:57.651
Damn, what's that word?

38:57.952 --> 39:01.012
"Hour." Something's happening
in an hour.

39:01.188 --> 39:04.180
- How in the world can you know that?
- I majored in linguistics.

39:04.358 --> 39:07.020
- My Latin's admittedly a bit fuzzy.
- Okay, keep going.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.427
"Station."

39:10.598 --> 39:14.090
No, wait. It's:

39:14.935 --> 39:17.369
- "South."
- And then:

39:20.574 --> 39:22.667
An exchange is being made.

39:22.843 --> 39:25.209
Um, an exchange at South Station.

39:25.379 --> 39:27.574
I think someone's
meeting at South Station...

39:27.748 --> 39:29.875
...to make an exchange in an hour.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.976
He just said, "Good, where was it?"

39:35.389 --> 39:37.653
"From the beginning on her person."

39:37.825 --> 39:41.352
It was on her person.

39:41.529 --> 39:44.930
Um, "it was on her from the start,"
maybe, or...

39:45.099 --> 39:49.229
- She had it on her the whole time.
- Oh, yeah, that's a possible translation.

39:51.105 --> 39:53.096
Hey, where you going?

40:02.116 --> 40:05.279
I've been asked
to officially ID her body.

40:46.327 --> 40:49.228
There was a 3-inch incision
in Evelina's right palm.

40:49.396 --> 40:51.387
Whatever she had, Davidson cut it out.

40:51.565 --> 40:53.465
She was hiding it in her hand.

40:53.634 --> 40:56.501
I'm heading to South Station.
He's planning a hand-off at 5.

40:56.670 --> 41:00.037
Davidson's working for the people
who hit the bus. I'll notify CI.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.801
In the meantime, I'm sending
field assist your way.

41:02.977 --> 41:05.844
Plainclothes only.
We don't wanna tip him off.

41:07.181 --> 41:09.979
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

41:10.484 --> 41:16.218
I believe, with proper demodulation, you
could receive satellite television for free.

41:16.390 --> 41:19.052
Okay, fun time's over.
Astrid, let's get him unhooked.

41:26.834 --> 41:28.233
It's me. I'm at the station.

41:29.603 --> 41:31.594
- Where am I meeting your man?
- Excuse me?

41:31.805 --> 41:35.104
I'm getting something.
It's in English.

41:36.010 --> 41:38.103
- We see you...
- Outside South Station.

41:38.279 --> 41:41.908
- Verifying you haven't been followed.
- Then we'll instruct you further.

41:48.255 --> 41:51.418
- It's Olivia.
- Hey. Roy's talking again.

41:51.592 --> 41:52.854
Are you at South Station?

41:53.027 --> 41:54.858
- Yeah, why?
- So are they.

41:55.029 --> 41:56.189
You get anything else?

41:56.363 --> 41:58.388
They're checking
Davidson wasn't followed.

41:58.566 --> 42:01.558
- I think that's it for now.
- Okay, thanks.

42:36.570 --> 42:38.401
Could I get a drink or something?

42:39.006 --> 42:41.406
Yeah. I'll get you a glass of water.

42:45.179 --> 42:48.512
- Go ahead.
- Clear on our end. Go inside.

42:48.682 --> 42:51.344
- Here you go.
- And head to the Dewey Square exit.

42:51.518 --> 42:52.542
Got that?

42:52.720 --> 42:54.745
How will I recognize
the person I'm meeting?

42:54.922 --> 42:56.787
He'll recognize you.

42:58.959 --> 43:00.654
- Yeah?
- It's happening now.

43:00.828 --> 43:03.888
- He's headed to the Dewey Square exit.
- Got it.

43:06.133 --> 43:07.760
- Francis.
- Got him.

43:07.935 --> 43:10.426
He's at the south end of the terminal.

43:30.491 --> 43:33.551
Turn around
and put your hands in the air now.

43:46.206 --> 43:48.231
- What happened?
- He's been shot.

43:48.442 --> 43:49.636
Call in a medevac.

43:49.810 --> 43:51.573
The case. They've made the exchange.

43:51.745 --> 43:53.178
- He's running.
- Stay with him.

44:17.838 --> 44:18.964
FBI!

44:22.343 --> 44:24.368
Put the case on the ground.

44:26.113 --> 44:28.013
Drop the gun now!

44:28.182 --> 44:30.377
Put your hands where I can see them.

45:17.097 --> 45:19.395
All that trouble for this.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.760
So any idea what it is?

45:23.036 --> 45:24.628
Not yet.

45:24.938 --> 45:28.430
But I'm hoping our friends
at the NSA will be able to tell us.

45:30.077 --> 45:33.569
So 11 innocent people died today.
We risked losing another by drilling...

45:33.747 --> 45:35.715
...through his head,
all for something...

45:35.883 --> 45:38.943
...we know nothing about.
- Do you ever smile, Dunham?

45:41.922 --> 45:43.583
We ID'd the shooter.

45:44.625 --> 45:47.059
Matthew Ziegler.
When we ran his fingerprints...

45:47.227 --> 45:49.661
...he popped up on two other
Pattern-related cases.

45:50.030 --> 45:52.555
We're digging into his financials,
travel records.

45:52.733 --> 45:56.794
Linkage, Dunham. Not only can we now
put a face to these people...

45:56.970 --> 45:59.962
...but we know
they're communicating, and how.

46:00.441 --> 46:02.773
I'd say
that's an impressive day's work.

46:04.611 --> 46:05.942
Which brings me to this.

46:06.980 --> 46:09.471
- What is it?
- Of all the models in Roy's apartment...

46:09.650 --> 46:11.982
...three are incidents
we haven't been aware of.

46:12.152 --> 46:14.916
- Pattern cases?
- It would seem so.

46:15.322 --> 46:18.189
Take a look, if you want.

46:19.993 --> 46:22.188
Let me know
if you have any thoughts.

46:23.430 --> 46:26.797
- I'll do that.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

46:32.272 --> 46:34.968
Yeah, I mean, he was pretty clear.

46:38.145 --> 46:41.478
- How are you feeling?
- My head hurts a little...

46:41.648 --> 46:44.014
...but, um, Dr. Bishop
gave me something for the pain.

46:44.184 --> 46:46.948
Vicodin. That's it, I promise.

46:47.120 --> 46:50.112
- So no more transmissions?
- No.

46:50.724 --> 46:53.887
My guess is, once you arrived
at South Station with the cavalry...

46:54.094 --> 46:57.120
...they realized the Ghost Network
was compromised and stopped.

46:57.297 --> 46:59.822
Well, just in case,
if you hear anything else...

47:00.000 --> 47:03.026
...do me a favor, give me a call.
- I will.

47:03.504 --> 47:07.964
It felt really nice to be able to help.

47:09.109 --> 47:10.906
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

47:11.378 --> 47:13.710
I have a few release forms
I need you to sign...

47:13.881 --> 47:15.974
...and then I can take you home.
- Okay.

47:18.018 --> 47:20.316
Dunham, any requests?

47:22.489 --> 47:25.356
- How about some Bach?
- Bach?

47:25.526 --> 47:29.519
Heh, heh, no, that's way too stuffy.
What you need is some jazz.

47:29.696 --> 47:31.687
Well, I'll take what I can get.

47:57.591 --> 48:01.288
I'm sure you can understand why
I don't go through the channels.

48:10.370 --> 48:14.067
If I know you at all, this isn't
the only reason you're here.

48:14.241 --> 48:16.937
Is this because of our interest
in Agent Dunham?

48:17.110 --> 48:19.601
Seems a bit early to be poaching
my newest hire...

48:19.780 --> 48:22.544
...with only
a three-case resume under her belt.

48:22.716 --> 48:24.240
I didn't achieve my position...

48:24.418 --> 48:27.683
...without the ability to evaluate
someone's talents immediately.

48:27.888 --> 48:29.480
Neither did I.

48:29.957 --> 48:32.221
Oh, you feel protective of her,
don't you?

48:33.060 --> 48:35.494
I'm in the business
of protecting all my agents.

48:35.696 --> 48:39.894
- I want nothing but the best for her.
- Of course you do.

48:56.416 --> 48:58.281
We found another one.

48:58.719 --> 49:00.653
Let's see what we have.

49:02.923 --> 49:04.823
Well, crystalline structure's intact.

49:05.759 --> 49:07.954
No detectable oscillations.

49:08.128 --> 49:10.688
This may just be what we need
to break the encryption.

49:10.864 --> 49:11.922
Speaking of which...

49:12.099 --> 49:14.966
...I'm told you've made progress.
- See for yourself.

49:15.335 --> 49:17.929
We finally stabilized the link.

49:18.105 --> 49:21.597
We've been pulling information
from the disc for the last 72 hours.

49:24.044 --> 49:26.239
Let me know when it's finished.
