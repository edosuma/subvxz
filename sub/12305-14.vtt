00:53.180 --> 01:01.897
Do you, Greg, take Susan to
be your lawfully-wedded wife...

01:02.314 --> 01:08.612
to have and to hold from this day
forward, until death do you part?

01:11.198 --> 01:13.200
I do.

01:17.704 --> 01:19.081
The ring, man.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.582
The ring.

01:22.209 --> 01:25.003
I'm... supposed to have the ring?

01:28.298 --> 01:29.591
- Come on.
- I got it. I got it right here.

01:29.716 --> 01:31.802
Relax. I got it.

01:36.181 --> 01:42.729
And do you, Susan, take Greg to
be your lawfully-wedded husband,

01:42.771 --> 01:49.319
to have and to hold from this day
forward, until death do you part?

01:50.987 --> 01:52.781
I, I do.

01:56.618 --> 01:58.120
Susan?!

01:59.287 --> 02:01.081
Susan?

02:01.498 --> 02:02.916
Susan?

02:13.802 --> 02:16.638
Susan? Susan?

02:16.680 --> 02:19.182
Susan, Susan, talk to me.

02:19.224 --> 02:20.183
Talk to me.

02:20.225 --> 02:22.686
No!

02:23.186 --> 02:23.770
Talk to me, Susan.

02:23.812 --> 02:24.688
Come on. we gotta get out of here!

02:24.730 --> 02:26.398
Come on, Susan.

02:28.108 --> 02:29.401
Susan!

02:29.443 --> 02:30.694
Go back!

02:31.319 --> 02:33.113
No, Susan!

02:40.287 --> 02:42.914
Come on, come on. We gotta go.

02:42.956 --> 02:44.708
We gotta go.

02:45.584 --> 02:47.210
move move

03:53.819 --> 03:55.404
Susan Alston.

03:55.821 --> 03:59.282
Poor girl took a bullet
before she could say, "I do. "

04:01.993 --> 04:04.162
Where's the groom, Frank?

04:04.204 --> 04:06.707
Bodyguard got him in a limousine
and hightailed it out of here.

04:06.748 --> 04:09.209
I put out a bolo out on the vehicle.

04:09.418 --> 04:10.460
Who is he?

04:10.502 --> 04:11.461
Greg Tanner.

04:11.503 --> 04:12.713
He's a baseball star.

04:12.796 --> 04:13.755
Real
up-and-comer.

04:13.797 --> 04:15.841
They say he might be the next A-Rod.

04:15.882 --> 04:19.219
Security was so tight,
they had a no-fly zone.

04:20.012 --> 04:21.805
Who's the other guy?

04:21.887 --> 04:22.681
Russell Brooks.

04:22.806 --> 04:24.975
Tanner's teammate and best man.

04:25.058 --> 04:27.185
They're quite a little duo.

04:31.815 --> 04:35.694
Mr. Brooks, my name is
lieutenant Horatio Caine.

04:36.987 --> 04:39.489
Mr. Tanner is conspicuously absent.

04:39.531 --> 04:41.199
Where is he?

04:42.409 --> 04:44.411
Look, I know the guy. Okay?

04:44.453 --> 04:46.371
We go way back to the minors,

04:46.413 --> 04:49.791
and the only reason Greg would go
anywhere is for his own safety, okay?

04:49.833 --> 04:54.504
Leaving his bride behind to die.

05:18.111 --> 05:19.696
I do.

06:30.061 --> 06:32.730
I interviewed about a dozen witnesses.

06:32.772 --> 06:35.399
We need to find the
location of the shooter.

06:35.441 --> 06:38.444
Everybody I talked to said that the
shot came from a different direction.

06:38.569 --> 06:40.947
We need that shell casing.

06:40.988 --> 06:41.864
I'm on it.

06:41.906 --> 06:43.032
Okay.

06:43.157 --> 06:44.909
Excuse me.

06:44.951 --> 06:46.661
Alexx?

06:46.953 --> 06:51.165
Whatever happened to "speak now or
forever hold your peace, " Horatio?

06:51.249 --> 06:53.751
That's a very good question, isn't it?

06:53.793 --> 06:55.962
Single gunshot wound, no exit.

06:56.045 --> 06:57.964
I'm sure I'll recover
the bullet at the post.

06:58.047 --> 07:02.218
But, Horatio, there's
something else here.

07:02.260 --> 07:05.847
I found a substance under
our bride's fingernails.

07:05.972 --> 07:07.849
It looks like human tissue.

07:07.932 --> 07:09.851
It's just a theory,

07:09.934 --> 07:13.938
but I'm thinking she might have
gotten into a fight before the wedding.

07:13.980 --> 07:18.359
A fight... on her wedding day.

07:18.442 --> 07:19.569
Alexx?

07:19.652 --> 07:21.571
As soon as you can.

07:23.865 --> 07:25.324
Airship to ground units.

07:25.366 --> 07:27.952
White limo matching the description
of vehicle carrying Greg Tanner

07:28.035 --> 07:31.038
traveling southbound
at Flagler and 11th.

07:33.666 --> 07:35.835
Get out of the car with your hands up.

07:35.877 --> 07:38.004
Exit the vehicle slowly.

07:38.045 --> 07:39.922
Keep your hands where we can see 'em.

07:39.964 --> 07:42.341
Throw it in "park, "
pal, and cut the engine.

07:42.550 --> 07:44.969
Hey! Stop the car!

07:45.136 --> 07:46.596
My mistake.

07:46.637 --> 07:48.306
Well, that's a felony mistake.

07:48.347 --> 07:49.932
Put your hands on the car.

07:56.147 --> 07:58.441
And here comes the groom.

08:03.738 --> 08:05.865
Look what we have here.

08:05.907 --> 08:06.490
Concealed weapon.

08:06.532 --> 08:08.826
I have a permit for that.

08:08.868 --> 08:11.370
I provide protection for Mr. Tanner.

08:11.412 --> 08:13.372
He's just doing his job.

08:13.664 --> 08:15.833
That's what I'm afraid of.

08:15.958 --> 08:17.710
One shot fired and one round missing.

08:17.752 --> 08:20.254
When was the last time
you fired this gun?

08:20.963 --> 08:22.507
I can't remember.

08:22.548 --> 08:25.551
I guess you're having trouble remembering
why you left that wedding, too, huh?

08:25.593 --> 08:28.346
Duane is my private security, okay?

08:28.471 --> 08:31.432
There's no chance he had
any involvement in this.

08:31.474 --> 08:33.226
Okay, all-star.

08:33.267 --> 08:36.145
Who else would want to hurt Susan?

08:36.187 --> 08:38.063
Nobody.

08:40.857 --> 08:43.361
I can tell you who did it.

08:46.364 --> 08:48.533
It was me.

08:55.832 --> 09:00.670
Yes. I killed Susan.

09:01.254 --> 09:03.798
Explain that, please.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.843
Someone was trying to get to me.

09:08.052 --> 09:10.847
Like who, Mr. Tanner?

09:11.264 --> 09:13.266
Got to be some obsessed fan.

09:13.349 --> 09:17.270
Just... didn't want me
breaking up the team.

09:17.311 --> 09:18.354
The team.

09:18.437 --> 09:20.648
Brooks and Tanner.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.238
all the fans have adopted us.

09:27.572 --> 09:29.949
He's the bad boy...

09:31.158 --> 09:33.870
they call me the legend.

09:37.456 --> 09:40.918
But I guess a wife just
didn't fit in that picture.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.964
So you believe you're
responsible for your wife's death.

09:48.634 --> 09:52.471
You ever see someone
you love die, lieutenant?

09:55.766 --> 09:57.935
Matter of fact, I have, Mr. Tanner.

09:58.060 --> 10:00.438
Right in front of your eyes?

10:02.440 --> 10:04.358
Yeah.

10:09.447 --> 10:12.742
When will I get this
image out of my mind?

10:15.161 --> 10:16.954
You won't.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.555
Is that the bodyguard's weapon?

10:34.639 --> 10:35.598
Yes.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.099
D anthere's definitely
one round missing,

10:37.141 --> 10:40.269
and I've got what looks to be
gunshot residue on the cylinder.

10:40.311 --> 10:41.562
Was it fired recently?

10:41.646 --> 10:44.565
I don't know. Unfortunately,
I can't put a time stamp on it.

10:44.607 --> 10:46.651
So we need the round.

10:46.734 --> 10:49.820
Yeah. It could be key
to the entire case.

10:49.862 --> 10:53.366
Okay, let's contact Alexx- see
if she's making any progress.

10:53.449 --> 10:54.951
You got it.

11:10.633 --> 11:12.301
Hey, I got a text from Calleigh.

11:12.343 --> 11:14.053
Were you able to get the
bullet out of the victim's head?

11:14.136 --> 11:15.930
I think it fragmented.

11:15.972 --> 11:18.140
Talk to me after the autopsy.

11:18.266 --> 11:20.935
While I'm looking, you should read this.

11:21.060 --> 11:24.397
Report on the dna under her nails.

11:24.438 --> 11:26.941
The groom said she
didn't have any enemies.

11:26.983 --> 11:30.236
She got into a cat fight with somebody.

11:30.361 --> 11:35.533
Micro particles of silica... mica...
in a petroleum film.

11:35.575 --> 11:38.035
That make sense to you?

11:38.744 --> 11:40.955
I'm willing to venture a guess.

11:41.038 --> 11:43.124
It's glitter wax.

11:43.166 --> 11:45.960
They use it at all the high-end
clubs on the dancer's poles.

11:46.043 --> 11:49.046
And just how would you know that?

11:49.463 --> 11:53.426
Greg Tanner's bachelor party was
at a gentlemen's club last night.

11:53.467 --> 12:00.558
Wait a minute. So the bride went to
the bachelor party at a strip club?

12:00.641 --> 12:01.934
A gentlemen's club.

12:02.059 --> 12:03.102
What's the difference?

12:03.144 --> 12:06.439
The difference- I can afford
to get into a strip club.

12:06.772 --> 12:09.734
Thanks for this. I'll be
back in a little while.

12:43.351 --> 12:44.227
Hello.

12:44.268 --> 12:45.311
Hi, how are you.

12:45.353 --> 12:46.812
Great, thanks. What can I do for you?

12:46.854 --> 12:49.732
The Greg Tanner bachelor party
was here last night, right?

12:49.774 --> 12:52.610
It started last night, yeah,
but it ended this morning.

12:52.652 --> 12:55.988
I mean, I don't even know how
that guy made it to the wedding.

12:56.030 --> 12:59.367
And the bride... well, she
drank everybody under the table.

12:59.450 --> 13:01.494
Well, that confirms that Susan was here.

13:01.536 --> 13:04.247
Would you mind if I took a look
where they were having the party?

13:04.288 --> 13:06.541
Of course, right this way.

13:06.582 --> 13:07.542
Great, thank you.

13:07.667 --> 13:08.751
I'm going to go check for evidence.

13:08.835 --> 13:10.253
All right.

13:13.673 --> 13:16.342
So who worked the Greg
Tanner party last night?

13:16.467 --> 13:18.553
Let's see here... Greg Tanner.

13:18.636 --> 13:22.265
The entertainer for him
was... Kelly Chapman.

13:22.306 --> 13:23.599
Kelly Chapman?

13:23.641 --> 13:25.768
You know, I'm going
to need to talk to her.

13:25.810 --> 13:27.436
Okay.

13:51.544 --> 13:53.671
Can I get you guys to move?

14:24.243 --> 14:25.495
I'm Kelly.

14:25.536 --> 14:27.538
You wanted to see me?

14:28.164 --> 14:31.959
Yeah, you hosted Greg Tanner's
bachelor party last night?

14:32.001 --> 14:35.755
I didn't host it exactly, but
hey, if that works for you.

14:35.796 --> 14:38.341
Was there a problem between
you and Greg's fiancÃ©e?

14:38.382 --> 14:40.968
- I mean, a sort of confrontation?
- No.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.054
We know she was in here last night.

14:43.095 --> 14:45.139
We found skin under her fingernails.

14:45.181 --> 14:46.849
Female dna.

14:47.266 --> 14:50.186
I'm happy to swab you
in for a comparison.

14:50.228 --> 14:53.147
Oh, keep your swab
in your poct, officer.

14:53.272 --> 14:55.399
She was here, she waved me over.

14:55.441 --> 14:58.444
What, to confront you
about dancing for Greg?

14:58.569 --> 15:01.072
You don't get it, do you?

15:01.572 --> 15:04.367
She wanted me to dance for her.

15:39.652 --> 15:42.113
So you gave the man's
fiancÃ©e a lap dance.

15:42.154 --> 15:46.367
Hey, maybe she wanted to
learn what turns Greg on.

15:46.534 --> 15:49.954
Looks like there was something going
on here last night besides dancing.

15:49.996 --> 15:51.038
All right, now we got a bullet.

15:51.164 --> 15:53.457
Are you still saying nothing happened?

15:53.499 --> 15:55.751
Well, not till it started raining.

15:56.043 --> 15:57.795
What do you mean raining?

15:57.837 --> 16:00.131
Ballplayers want to be like rappers.

16:00.173 --> 16:03.342
Greg and his guys started
showering dancers with hundreds.

16:03.467 --> 16:04.969
Making it rain.

16:18.858 --> 16:19.859
drop the money.

16:19.942 --> 16:22.653
Or the next one's coming towards you.

16:23.446 --> 16:26.240
That's probably what the bodyguard
was hiding when Tripp pulled him over.

16:26.365 --> 16:29.744
It would also explain why
his gun had been fired.

16:29.785 --> 16:31.537
I think this is our missing round.

16:31.662 --> 16:34.832
If the striations match the gun,
the bodyguard's off the hook.

16:34.874 --> 16:36.417
Yep.

16:36.459 --> 16:38.336
Is there anything else you need from me?

16:38.377 --> 16:41.047
No. If we do, we'll be in touch.

16:42.757 --> 16:45.134
Touching's extra.

16:49.555 --> 16:52.558
this is a very sexy day at the office.

17:04.194 --> 17:05.780
I reviews Susan Alston's x-ray.

17:05.905 --> 17:09.075
The only fragment I found
was the one that killed her.

17:09.116 --> 17:11.327
Which means that bullet
ricocheted, Alexx.

17:11.368 --> 17:14.579
It also means, Horatio, the rest of the
fragments are back at the crime scene.

17:14.704 --> 17:16.540
Which is where we'll be.

17:16.582 --> 17:18.334
- Horatio...
- yeah.

17:18.376 --> 17:21.878
- That young bride...
- never had to die.

17:47.381 --> 17:49.091
did you get something?

17:49.132 --> 17:50.801
Yeah, it's a bullet frag.

17:50.884 --> 17:53.095
It looks like it's
wrapped around something.

17:53.136 --> 17:54.888
It could be a diamond.

17:55.097 --> 17:57.474
Maybe from the engagement ring?

17:58.308 --> 17:58.934
I don't think so.

17:58.976 --> 18:02.271
It looks like it could
have come off the veil.

18:17.286 --> 18:18.078
That makes sense.

18:18.203 --> 18:19.788
It's the closet thing to her head.

18:19.871 --> 18:22.207
You know we've got the
veil back at that lab.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.668
Want to see if it's holding any secrets?

18:24.710 --> 18:26.003
Yes.

18:43.687 --> 18:44.479
Hi.

18:44.521 --> 18:45.272
Hey.

18:45.397 --> 18:48.191
So did you get anything from
trace yet on that frag we found?

18:48.233 --> 18:50.027
No, that's going to take too long.

18:50.068 --> 18:52.237
I think we should perform
our own experiment,

18:52.279 --> 18:54.990
and test it against what we
know to be a real diamond.

18:55.073 --> 18:56.283
My earring.

18:56.325 --> 18:58.076
Okay.

18:58.368 --> 19:02.289
The molecular structure of carbon makes
it one of the hardest surfaces on earth.

19:02.372 --> 19:05.375
So it should scratch glass.

19:08.587 --> 19:11.882
So we know that those are authentic.

19:12.007 --> 19:13.884
Let's check it against...

19:13.926 --> 19:15.802
the diamond from the veil.

19:18.972 --> 19:20.807
It's fake.

19:21.308 --> 19:24.394
You know, that veil was made especially
for this wedding by amanda ravaro

19:24.436 --> 19:26.146
and it sold for $1.8 million.

19:26.188 --> 19:27.856
That's a pretty expensive fake.

19:27.898 --> 19:30.984
I think that it's time someone
had a conversation with Mr. Ravaro.

19:31.068 --> 19:33.362
You know, natalia's out in the field.

19:33.445 --> 19:35.697
Maybe she can stop by for a little chat.

19:54.091 --> 19:56.176
I could sue you for slander.

19:56.301 --> 19:58.428
Those diamonds are authentic.

19:58.470 --> 20:02.307
Our lab report says that every one
of those stones is a cubic zirconium.

20:02.349 --> 20:04.101
I don't care what your lab says.

20:04.142 --> 20:05.852
The veil that left here was genuine.

20:05.894 --> 20:07.854
I don't know how she
ended up with a fake.

20:07.896 --> 20:12.109
Here. These are reports
from reputable gemologists.

20:13.277 --> 20:17.447
So... so you had it appraised
and then you sold the fake.

20:17.489 --> 20:19.533
And then you kept the real one
and the 1.8 million for yourself.

20:19.574 --> 20:22.995
And then probably the bride found out it
was a fake and was going to expose you.

20:23.036 --> 20:25.247
I design every piece by hand.

20:25.289 --> 20:27.791
I put a gps chip in every creation.

20:27.833 --> 20:29.084
So Susan's veil has one?

20:29.126 --> 20:30.752
The real one.

20:30.794 --> 20:34.881
And I have a program that allows me to
track it right here from my computer.

20:34.923 --> 20:37.301
Fantastic. Will you
activate it for me please?

20:37.342 --> 20:39.303
Of course.

20:57.279 --> 20:59.489
step away from the car.

21:04.202 --> 21:05.370
who are you people?

21:05.495 --> 21:07.372
I can ask you the same question.

21:07.414 --> 21:09.499
Can I see some I.D.?

21:11.793 --> 21:15.505
Hey, everyone knows
me- I'm Alan Farris.

21:16.173 --> 21:17.591
Sports agent.

21:17.674 --> 21:19.426
You represent Greg Tanner.

21:19.468 --> 21:22.179
Since he was drafted
out of high school, yeah.

21:22.220 --> 21:23.597
Made a dumb kid a rich man.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.599
I'm going to need to look in your trunk.

21:25.682 --> 21:26.767
Open it.

21:26.808 --> 21:28.769
You're going to need a warrant.

21:28.894 --> 21:30.979
Well, the gps that's
transmitting from your car

21:31.104 --> 21:33.774
gives us probably cause for a warrant.

21:34.399 --> 21:36.985
Open the trunk please.

21:45.494 --> 21:47.496
okay, trunk.

21:52.876 --> 21:55.337
You getting married, Mr. Farris?

21:55.379 --> 21:57.297
Greg was holding back his commission.

21:57.381 --> 21:59.132
All right, he owes me over $2 million.

21:59.174 --> 22:02.469
So you decided to steal his
fiancÃ©e's veil as collateral?

22:02.594 --> 22:04.680
I told him if he'd
pay, I'd give it back.

22:04.721 --> 22:07.474
Instead, he just had a replica made.

22:07.599 --> 22:10.602
- So you went to plan B.
- Plan b?

22:10.644 --> 22:12.229
Plan B.

22:12.271 --> 22:15.190
Decided to kill Greg, you
took a shot at him, you missed,

22:15.232 --> 22:16.692
and you killed his fiancÃ©e instead.

22:16.775 --> 22:17.859
That's insane!

22:17.901 --> 22:19.194
I wasn't even at the wedding.

22:19.278 --> 22:21.488
Yes, but you had motive.

22:21.905 --> 22:26.368
Once we run you and your clothes
for gsr, you're going down.

22:26.410 --> 22:27.452
For what?!

22:27.494 --> 22:31.999
For a little thing that
we like to call murder one.

22:32.374 --> 22:34.167
Lock him up.

22:49.808 --> 22:52.102
Thank you so much for coming back.

22:54.896 --> 22:59.401
Listen, I'm, uh, I'm slammed, but you
sounded frantic on the phone, so what's up?

22:59.443 --> 23:00.777
Okay, um...

23:00.902 --> 23:05.073
well, last night here in the club,
this guy used a fake credit card,

23:05.115 --> 23:06.908
and, you know, completely
skipped out on his bill.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.286
It was $20, 000.

23:09.494 --> 23:15.000
I... I'm kind of in, you
know, big trouble, okay?

23:15.083 --> 23:17.127
I'm the one who's on the hook for it.

23:17.169 --> 23:20.589
The owner here, he's gonna make
me pay back every single dime.

23:20.631 --> 23:23.383
And I don't have anywhere
near that kind of money, so...

23:23.425 --> 23:24.718
what do you want me to do about it?

23:24.760 --> 23:25.928
Well, it's club policy, you know,

23:25.969 --> 23:30.849
no customer can leave without putting their
thumbprint on their credit card receipt.

23:30.891 --> 23:35.687
Uh, this, uh... it sounds like something
the economic crimes unit should handle.

23:35.729 --> 23:38.482
I'll give you a number, all right?

23:40.275 --> 23:47.491
Well, I figured... since I know you,
that you could find this guy for me.

23:49.368 --> 23:50.661
Come on.

23:50.702 --> 23:54.373
Come on, I-I know you don't want
me to get into any kind of trouble.

23:54.414 --> 23:59.378
Lexa... you don't have
to do this this way.

23:59.419 --> 24:01.171
All right?

24:03.507 --> 24:05.133
Sorry.

24:05.175 --> 24:07.386
I'm just scared.

24:07.427 --> 24:08.971
All right.

24:09.388 --> 24:11.390
I'll see what I can do.

24:11.431 --> 24:13.100
Okay.

24:25.570 --> 24:27.906
No promises, okay?

24:54.484 --> 24:56.987
hey, man, what are you doing?

24:57.571 --> 25:01.700
just, uh, just running
a print on something.

25:02.200 --> 25:06.663
Does that, uh... does that have
anything to do with the Greg Tanner case?

25:08.373 --> 25:10.751
No, it's for something else.

25:10.792 --> 25:13.086
So that's how it is now-
we're not gonna be...

25:13.170 --> 25:16.298
sharing information
with each other anymore.

25:16.590 --> 25:18.175
Look, relax, Wolfe.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.761
I'm just helping a
girl out with something.

25:20.802 --> 25:23.263
Wait a second. Is
that who I think it is?

25:23.388 --> 25:24.431
Is that the best man?

25:24.473 --> 25:28.060
Yeah, that's him-
Russell Brooks.

25:28.101 --> 25:30.520
Look at all those priors.

25:30.562 --> 25:34.483
It looks like the "bad boy" has
been keeping a lot of secrets.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.788
So, you were at the pole last night.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.457
My boy's bachelor
party- wouldn't miss it.

25:50.499 --> 25:53.168
Yeah, well, you missed out
on paying your $20, 000 check.

25:53.210 --> 25:55.796
You left it for some
young girl to cover.

25:56.463 --> 25:57.756
How would you know that?

25:57.798 --> 25:59.967
Because I ran the prints
on the credit card receipt,

26:00.092 --> 26:02.511
and guess whose picture popped up?

26:02.552 --> 26:04.972
Okay, so I ran my bill up a little.

26:07.182 --> 26:08.225
So?

26:08.267 --> 26:10.519
You got an interesting
list of priors here.

26:10.561 --> 26:12.896
You were detained for
skipping out on a hotel charge,

26:13.272 --> 26:14.731
detained for a check kiting beef,

26:14.773 --> 26:19.695
and, uh, in a theft investigation
you were detained but never charged.

26:19.736 --> 26:21.280
Good lawyer.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.199
- Well, you're detained again.
- For what?

26:24.283 --> 26:26.577
This time, it's credit card fraud.

26:26.618 --> 26:28.870
And this time you're looking at jail.

26:30.872 --> 26:34.376
I... I can't go to jail, man-I
got training camp in a week.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.671
Well... you're not going anywhere.

26:37.796 --> 26:39.381
Believe that.

26:39.464 --> 26:41.967
get out your checkbook.

26:43.385 --> 26:45.470
For what?

26:46.763 --> 26:49.766
Because you're gonna pay
that girl back every cent.

27:08.869 --> 27:10.996
I hear our suspect list is growing.

27:11.079 --> 27:12.039
Yeah.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.582
Ballplayer's own agent?

27:13.624 --> 27:15.334
Yep. Alan Farris.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.128
I'm just about to run
his clothes for gsr.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.881
The guy's got plenty
of motive and no alibi.

27:20.964 --> 27:24.593
Yep. All we need is a
little slam-dunk proof.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.390
Did you fire your weapon today?

27:30.432 --> 27:32.184
No. Why?

27:32.267 --> 27:34.186
You're glowing.

27:36.897 --> 27:39.566
I have no idea how that got there.

27:39.775 --> 27:42.486
It could be secondary transfer.

27:42.861 --> 27:44.488
Where have you been?

27:44.571 --> 27:48.367
Pd all morning, then I got a call out
after I stopped that limousine, but...

27:49.660 --> 27:50.494
wait a second.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.454
Hands up.

27:52.496 --> 27:54.248
Exit the vehicle slowly.

27:54.289 --> 27:55.249
Keep your hands where we can see them.

27:55.290 --> 27:57.584
Throw it in park, pal,
and cut the engine.

27:57.668 --> 28:00.379
hey! I said stop the car!

28:00.462 --> 28:02.589
My mistake.

28:05.467 --> 28:09.054
Are you thinking gsr
transfer from an automobile?

28:09.096 --> 28:11.974
Maybe it's where the shooter
took cover when he fired.

28:12.099 --> 28:15.185
Then I think I should take
a second look at that limo.

28:37.666 --> 28:41.670
I have got what appears to be a
gun mount on this undercarriage.

28:41.795 --> 28:45.674
Looks to be an electronic trigger
with some sort of a wireless receiver.

28:45.716 --> 28:48.468
So it was remotely fired.

28:48.594 --> 28:51.889
That would explain why none of
our suspects had any trace of gsr.

28:51.930 --> 28:55.893
So any pda or cell phone
could have triggered it.

28:56.894 --> 29:02.065
To have and to hold from this day
forward until death do you part?

29:04.985 --> 29:06.069
I do.

29:09.072 --> 29:11.366
no!

29:18.790 --> 29:23.462
and my guess is this wireless signal would
have had a range of about 30 to 35 feet.

29:23.503 --> 29:25.297
Who was the driver?

29:25.380 --> 29:26.924
Duane Cross.

29:26.965 --> 29:28.800
I need to see him.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.976
We fndou a gun mount under
your limousine, Mr. Cross.

29:38.060 --> 29:40.562
I don't know anything about that.

29:40.771 --> 29:43.482
I told you before, my job
is to protect Greg Tanner.

29:43.523 --> 29:45.692
What about his wife?

29:46.193 --> 29:47.778
She's not my responsibility.

29:47.861 --> 29:48.862
Apparently not.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.572
Where were you sitting?

29:50.697 --> 29:52.866
I was sitting in the front row.

29:55.786 --> 29:57.829
How could I possibly be the shooter?

29:57.871 --> 30:02.584
The weapon was triggered
remotely, Mr. Cross.

30:03.377 --> 30:07.172
How do you know that
bullet wasn't meant for me?

30:09.091 --> 30:11.385
I'm clean.

30:15.681 --> 30:18.100
Yes, Eric, go back to the crime scene.

30:18.183 --> 30:22.062
We're not gonna find the
shooter until we find the target.

30:28.569 --> 30:30.696
How do we know where the car was parked?

30:30.779 --> 30:34.783
The driver left very
clear acceleration marks.

30:39.162 --> 30:40.622
We know where the shot came from.

30:40.664 --> 30:44.293
And the altar's about
20 feet behind you.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.796
Soon as we install this
laser on the gun mount,

30:47.879 --> 30:51.883
we should be able to follow
the beam to our victim.

31:12.779 --> 31:15.574
Homing sensor sends a signal...

31:15.699 --> 31:20.287
gun finds it, locks on, circuit's
complete, the target's found.

31:20.370 --> 31:23.874
So whoever was sitting in that
chair was our intended victim.

31:23.999 --> 31:26.376
Yeah, but why'd the shot kill the bride?

31:26.460 --> 31:27.044
I don't know.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.171
Let's recreate the moment.

31:45.979 --> 31:48.607
You tell anyone I did
this, I'll kill you.

31:48.690 --> 31:51.276
You are the same height
as the bride, right?

31:51.318 --> 31:53.487
And I'm wearing her fake veil.

31:53.570 --> 31:55.155
With the lighter stones.

31:55.197 --> 32:01.078
And with a precision shot like this, as
little as a millimeter can mean life or death.

32:01.578 --> 32:05.791
So the fake stones put Susan
Alston in the line ofir fe.

32:12.798 --> 32:16.969
The bullet hit the zirconium
and fragmented into her head.

32:18.595 --> 32:20.889
So the true target was behind her.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.100
All we need now is a name.

32:29.273 --> 32:32.401
So Calleigh and Delko
found the target seat.

32:32.484 --> 32:35.237
But do we have the guest's
name yet, Mr. Wolfe?

32:35.279 --> 32:38.490
Well, event security gave me
access to the guests' information,

32:38.532 --> 32:42.286
so this should give us a
list of the guests' names.

32:45.372 --> 32:48.375
The target was Kelly Chapman.

32:49.167 --> 32:50.836
She's a dancer at the club.

32:50.877 --> 32:54.089
Yes, she was, and she
was the intended victim.

32:54.131 --> 32:55.799
We need to find her.

33:10.981 --> 33:13.066
I don't understand.

33:13.191 --> 33:15.861
That bullet was meant for you.

33:19.573 --> 33:23.076
Susan Alston merely got in the way.

33:35.172 --> 33:39.092
I didn't think he was capable
of something like that.

33:39.176 --> 33:42.179
Who was capable of something like that?

33:42.262 --> 33:44.056
Greg Tanner.

33:44.139 --> 33:45.891
The groom?

33:46.183 --> 33:48.685
Why would he want to shoot you?

33:52.481 --> 33:55.275
Greg was my best customer.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.362
So you danced for Greg more than once?

33:58.862 --> 34:00.822
We had regular sessions.

34:00.864 --> 34:04.993
And extra-curricular sessions.

34:05.285 --> 34:07.913
So he was at your home.

34:07.955 --> 34:10.958
Nobody knew him like I did.

34:10.998 --> 34:13.960
And Greg was all about secrets.

34:14.460 --> 34:16.880
What kind of secrets?

34:31.562 --> 34:36.275
Kelly, I really need you to tell
me what kinda secrets Greg had.

35:35.877 --> 35:37.128
That's right.

35:37.170 --> 35:43.593
Who would have thought america's hero,
"the legend, " would do something like that?

36:04.280 --> 36:07.075
We'll book you guys
when we can get to you.

36:07.659 --> 36:12.163
We pulled this from the underside
of your limo this morning.

36:12.205 --> 36:14.624
I'm supposed to know what that is?

36:14.666 --> 36:17.460
It was used to hold the
gun that killed Susan.

36:17.585 --> 36:20.588
It's remote-controlled via wireless.

36:20.630 --> 36:22.423
What does that mean?

36:22.465 --> 36:28.888
Well, it means that somebody at your wedding
used a pda or a cell phone to fire the weapon.

36:28.972 --> 36:31.182
The bullet was originally
intended for Kelly Chapman.

36:31.224 --> 36:32.392
Does that help you out?

36:32.433 --> 36:34.060
Kelly?

36:35.770 --> 36:37.772
Why would I kill Kelly?

36:37.897 --> 36:41.693
I think we both know that you
had reason to keep Kelly quiet.

36:42.360 --> 36:48.157
That... that... That one.

36:48.199 --> 36:51.661
you know, there's something
really sort of nice about this one.

36:51.703 --> 36:54.372
You look real pretty in this one.

36:56.874 --> 37:00.169
You know, I think this
one is really my favorite.

37:00.878 --> 37:05.174
Wh ien was getting married, she
threatened to use these against me.

37:06.676 --> 37:09.178
Kelly, babe.

37:09.971 --> 37:12.599
You are special to me, okay?

37:12.682 --> 37:14.225
You know that.

37:14.267 --> 37:16.686
You always will be.

37:17.395 --> 37:19.022
But?

37:19.063 --> 37:21.399
But... I'm getting married.

37:21.691 --> 37:24.319
I need to make that work.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.905
So, what, I'm just out?

37:26.946 --> 37:29.490
Don't put it that way.

37:29.866 --> 37:31.784
You're forgetting, Greg.

37:31.868 --> 37:33.578
What am I forgetting?

37:34.495 --> 37:37.165
I have pictures of you.

37:38.291 --> 37:40.585
What are you talking about?

37:40.627 --> 37:42.879
You look so cute in fishnets.

37:44.380 --> 37:47.175
Maybe it could be your new trading card.

37:47.216 --> 37:49.052
No, you will not do that.

37:49.093 --> 37:53.264
Just remember, Greg,
you did this to yourself.

37:55.099 --> 38:00.063
Well, you aimed for Kelly, but
you shot your fiancÃ©e instead.

38:00.188 --> 38:02.148
Maybe I should have
brought my lawyer here.

38:02.190 --> 38:05.693
I need you to put your cell
phone on the table, please.

38:11.366 --> 38:13.076
If your phone was used
to fire the weapon,

38:13.159 --> 38:17.497
it'll still be linked to the wireless
receiver and the trigger mechanism.

38:17.580 --> 38:20.875
The phone will connect
to the wireless receiver,

38:20.917 --> 38:24.170
and should react automatically
and start ringing.

39:06.296 --> 39:08.965
aren't you going to get that, Russell?

39:09.882 --> 39:11.885
I'll get it later.

39:12.886 --> 39:16.681
Let's... get it now.

39:22.896 --> 39:24.689
hey, it's just my phone.

39:26.482 --> 39:29.360
It's a murder weapon, my friend.

39:39.162 --> 39:40.663
Brooks?

39:55.178 --> 39:56.888
The ring.

39:57.180 --> 39:59.390
I'm supposed to have the ring?

40:08.274 --> 40:09.275
I got it. I got it right here.

40:09.317 --> 40:11.569
Relax. I got it.

40:18.159 --> 40:19.285
Susan, talk to me!

40:19.327 --> 40:20.578
Talk to me!

40:20.620 --> 40:22.664
No!

40:23.373 --> 40:24.791
You!

40:24.832 --> 40:26.167
hey, hey

40:26.584 --> 40:28.962
You did this?

40:29.462 --> 40:30.463
You killed Susan?

40:30.588 --> 40:33.091
Greg, it wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

40:33.132 --> 40:34.842
You shot her!

40:34.884 --> 40:37.262
The bullet was meant for Kelly.

40:39.472 --> 40:41.891
Why?

40:43.059 --> 40:43.935
You told me to.

40:43.977 --> 40:45.937
No. I told you to talk to her.

40:45.979 --> 40:47.855
You told me to deal with it.

40:47.897 --> 40:51.359
She was blackmailing
you, so I dealt with it.

40:51.693 --> 40:55.488
- You killed the only woman I ever loved!
- Greg.

40:55.530 --> 40:57.574
Take him out.

40:57.657 --> 40:59.659
Hey, Tanner.

40:59.867 --> 41:01.661
Greg.

41:02.787 --> 41:04.497
Greg!

41:09.168 --> 41:11.879
All right. All right.

41:32.567 --> 41:34.360
I do.
