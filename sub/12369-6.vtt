00:05.839 --> 00:08.258
All: AWW.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.760

JUST LIKE THE CALENDAR.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.637
OKAY, SEAN.
PUT YOUR SHIRT BACK ON.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.265
All:
[disappointed] AWW.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.976
- THANKS FOR BEING

00:18.059 --> 00:19.769
- YEAH, AND FOR TEACHING US
THAT OTHER THING.

00:19.853 --> 00:20.729
- BABY CPR.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.565
- YES, THAT.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.650
NOW, IF ANY BABIES FAINT

00:25.734 --> 00:27.402
WHEN THEY HEAR THAT I'M DATING
SIR EMMET LAWSON,

00:27.485 --> 00:29.988
I'LL KNOW HOW TO REVIVE THEM.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.156
- YOU'RE DATING EMMET LAWSON,
THE MOVIE STAR?

00:32.240 --> 00:36.786
- HOW DID YOU DRAG THAT
OUT OF ME?

00:36.870 --> 00:37.912
NEXT,
YOU'LL BE GETTING ME

00:37.996 --> 00:39.289
TO ADMIT
THAT HE'S ACCEPTING AN AWARD

00:39.372 --> 00:42.250
AT THE VENICE FILM FESTIVAL--
OOPS.

00:42.333 --> 00:46.004
[Italian accent]
<i>SCUSI,</i> I SAY TOO MUCH.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.298
- WOW, THAT MUST BE A RUSH,
DATING SOMEBODY SO FAMOUS.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.091
- WELL,
I'M A PRETTY FAMOUS ACTRESS

00:50.175 --> 00:51.468
IN MY OWN RIGHT.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.761
- OH.

00:52.844 --> 00:56.264
JOY DIDN'T MENTION
YOU WERE AN ACTRESS.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.600
- WELL, THEN WHAT DO YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT?

00:58.683 --> 01:01.519
- YOU'VE SEEN HIM SHIRTLESS.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.188
WHY WOULD THEY TALK?

01:04.272 --> 01:06.316
- I GOTTA GET
TO THE STATION.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.984
- I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.445
- OH, HEY.
UH--

01:10.528 --> 01:12.155
ARE YOU A <i> STAR TREK</i> FAN?

01:12.238 --> 01:14.824
- I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER SEEN
A <i> STAR TREK</i> MOVIE.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.118
- WELL,
WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THAT TONIGHT.

01:17.202 --> 01:22.457
I'M GOING TO BOLDLY GO
WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.836
- UNLIKELY.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.966
- YOU KNOW, SEAN JUST SAID
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY WISE.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.010
EMMET IS A LOT MORE FAMOUS
THAN I AM.

01:34.093 --> 01:37.096
- THAT TAKES A GENIUS?

01:37.180 --> 01:39.808
- EMMET IS WORLD-FAMOUS.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.352
AND FAME IS
AN INCREDIBLE APHRODISIAC.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.062
SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

01:44.145 --> 01:45.855
- WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.858
A MAN IS ONLY AS FAITHFUL
AS HIS OPTIONS,

01:48.942 --> 01:51.736
AND EMMET'S GOT LOTS
OF OPTIONS.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.865
ME, FOR INSTANCE.

01:55.949 --> 01:56.991
[phone rings]

01:57.075 --> 01:59.494
- AH, THAT MUST BE MELANIE.

01:59.577 --> 02:04.415
- SO ARE YOU READY
FOR OUR BUSINESS TRIP?

02:04.499 --> 02:08.336
- CODE NAME:
SECRET MIDNIGHT RUN.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.547
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
MAMIE SUE,

02:10.630 --> 02:15.510
IT'S NOT CODE
IF IT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.719
- I'M SORRY.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.056
I'M JUST NOT AS GANGSTA
AS YOU.

02:24.143 --> 02:25.562
- SO HOW DID IT GO?

02:25.645 --> 02:27.230
- OH,
ALEC HASN'T COME IN YET.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.231
AND I'M A WRECK.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.191
I HAVE NO IDEA
IF HE HEARD ME SAY

02:30.275 --> 02:31.234
I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.360
OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE AN ACTRESS.

02:32.443 --> 02:33.444
HOW DO I PLAY THIS?

02:33.528 --> 02:36.197
- UH,
STRIKE A SEXY, NONCHALANT POSE,

02:36.281 --> 02:38.241
THINK '60s FRENCH CINEMA.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.077
-<i> PINK PANTHER?</i>

02:41.161 --> 02:44.622
- NO.
TRUFFAUT, GODARD, VADIM.

02:44.706 --> 02:48.585
- [sighs]
I'LL JUST UNBUTTON MY BLOUSE.

02:52.630 --> 02:56.634
WELCOME BACK, ALEC.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.433
- HELLO, MELANIE.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.770
- HI, ALEC.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.981
PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE
I WAS SNIFFING MY ARMPIT.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.775
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS DOING.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.235
I WAS, UM--

03:14.319 --> 03:18.448
I WAS BITING OFF
A-A LOOSE THREAD.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.116
[spits]

03:20.199 --> 03:22.410
- LOOK.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.454
I NEED TO MAKE THIS QUICK.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.623
BEFORE I LEFT, I OVERHEARD
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.124
- YOU DID?

03:28.207 --> 03:29.584
- OH.
HELLO, MELANIE.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.585
- HI, CHLOE.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.337
LOOK WHO'S BACK.
ALEC.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.421
- I KNOW.
I WAS WITH HIM.

03:33.504 --> 03:36.591
IT WAS VERY ROMANTIC,
ACTUALLY.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.519
{\an8}I'M GONNA GO GET
SOME COFFEE,

03:48.603 --> 03:51.814
{\an8}AND THEN WE CAN GET TO WORK.
OKAY, BABE?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.608
{\an8}- OKAY.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.946
{\an8}[door closes]

03:58.029 --> 03:59.155
{\an8}- SO YOU TWO
ARE BACK TOGETHER.

03:59.238 --> 04:01.324
{\an8}I'M SUPER EXCITED
FOR YOU.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.492
{\an8}COULD YOU USE A DRINK?
I COULD USE A DRINK.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.286
{\an8}- LISTEN, MELANIE.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.829
{\an8}I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU TOO.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.289
{\an8}- YOU ARE?

04:08.373 --> 04:10.291
{\an8}- PRACTICALLY FROM
THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW YOU.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.461
{\an8}- OH, GOD, ALEC.

04:13.544 --> 04:14.462
{\an8}OH, WAIT.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.798
{\an8}WHAT WAS THAT WITH CHLOE?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.384
{\an8}- CHLOE FLEW DOWN TO COZUMEL
TO TELL ME

04:19.466 --> 04:20.510
{\an8}THAT OUR PET CAT
HAD DIED.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.470
{\an8}EVEN AFTER THE DIVORCE,

04:22.553 --> 04:24.013
{\an8}WE--

04:24.097 --> 04:27.934
{\an8}WE SHARED A LOVE
FOR OUR...

04:28.017 --> 04:29.352
{\an8}OUR LITTLE PUSS PUSS.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.318
{\an8}- I'M SO SORRY.
- THANK YOU.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.863
{\an8}SHE WOULD'VE LIKED YOU.

04:40.947 --> 04:41.531
{\an8}[sighs]

04:41.614 --> 04:43.950
{\an8}WELL,
CHLOE WAS A MESS,

04:44.033 --> 04:45.660
{\an8}AND I WAS TRYING
TO CONSOLE HER,

04:45.743 --> 04:46.995
{\an8}AND THEN--
WELL, SHE MISINTERPRETED IT.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.871
{\an8}- MM.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.707
{\an8}- IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU GOT EVEN PRETTIER

04:50.790 --> 04:52.834
{\an8}WHILE I WAS GONE?

04:52.917 --> 04:56.045
{\an8}- MAYBE.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.673
{\an8}WAIT.

04:58.756 --> 04:59.841
{\an8}SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

04:59.924 --> 05:00.883
{\an8}I MEAN,
HOW ARE WE GONNA TELL CHLOE?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.552
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.761
IT'S COMPLICATED.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.389
SHE'S GONNA WANT YOU FIRED.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.057
SHE'S GONNA MAKE MY LIFE
A LIVING HELL.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.726
IT'LL PROBABLY RUIN
THE BUSINESS.

05:09.809 --> 05:10.893
- AND SHE'S TOLD ME
THREE TIMES

05:10.977 --> 05:14.397
SHE HAS A WOOD CHIPPER.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.692
- YOU KNOW, WE WILL TAKE THIS
IN BABY STEPS.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.236
FIRST,
I'LL GET HER A NEW CAT.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.030
AND THEN WHEN SHE'S
IN A BETTER EMOTIONAL PLACE,

05:22.113 --> 05:24.949
I'LL JUST TELL HER,
"WE ARE NOT TOGETHER."

05:25.033 --> 05:26.868
- AND MAYBE
IN THE MEANTIME,

05:26.951 --> 05:30.038
WE CAN SECRETLY FOOL AROUND
A LITTLE?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.581
- I LIKE
THE WAY YOU THINK.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.374
- [laughs]

05:33.458 --> 05:35.585
- SO LET'S TALK
ABOUT CLEVELAND FANTASY CON.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.754
THE CLIENT WANTS US
TO WEAR COSTUMES.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.256
I WAS THINKING YOU SHOULD GO
AS CAPTAIN INVINCIBLE,

05:40.339 --> 05:42.425
AND I'LL BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND,
SEDUCTRA.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.635
AND MELANIE,
YOU CAN GO AS SCAT,

05:44.719 --> 05:48.264
OUR PET GARGOYLE.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.434
- THEY'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE A PET.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.770
I MISS PUSS PUSS.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.731
- ME TOO.
HOLD ME.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.232
[sniffles]

05:58.316 --> 05:59.776
SCAT.
- YES?

05:59.859 --> 06:02.361
- NO, I MEAN--
- UH, YEAH.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.324
- AWW, NOW LOOK
WHAT'S TRENDING ON GOOGLE.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.159
EMMET LAWSON IN VENICE

06:08.242 --> 06:12.580
WITH HIS ARMS AROUND
A NEWLY DIVORCED KATE WINSLET.

06:12.663 --> 06:15.958
- OH, SHE LOOKS GOOD.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.002
I MEAN,
OH, SHE LOOKS BAD, RIGHT?

06:20.379 --> 06:22.840
- BUT ONCE THEY COMMITTED
TO THAT KLINGON DESIGN,

06:22.924 --> 06:24.300
THEY OPENED THEMSELVES UP

06:24.383 --> 06:27.428
TO A LOT OF RETROACTIVE
CONTINUITY ISSUES.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.472
I MEAN, WHICH IS COMMON
IN SEQUELS, OBVIOUSLY.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.099
- HI, GUYS.
HAVE FUN?

06:31.182 --> 06:33.976
- IT WAS AWESOME.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.436
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS POOR WOMAN

06:35.520 --> 06:36.979
NEVER SAW A <i> STAR TREK</i> MOVIE.

06:37.063 --> 06:42.777
- AND NOW I'VE SEEN FIVE.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.780
- OH, HEY.
CLEVELAND FANTASY CON.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.490
- YEAH, MY COMPANY'S DOING
ALL THE PR.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.784
- JOY.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.285
YOU HAVE GOT TO GO WITH ME.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.538
THERE'S, LIKE,
A HUNDRED SCI-FI BOOTHS.

06:53.621 --> 06:56.916
I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA BE YAWNING
WITH EXCITEMENT.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.711
- I EXPLAINED TO HIM
WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW,

07:00.795 --> 07:04.674
THAT I YAWN
WHEN I'M EXCITED.

07:04.757 --> 07:05.883
[laughter]

07:05.967 --> 07:07.468
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
COME OVER

07:07.552 --> 07:09.178
TO ALEC'S OFFICE TOMORROW,
AND WE CAN ALL GO OVER TOGETHER?

07:09.262 --> 07:12.515
- I'M YAWNING ALREADY!

07:12.598 --> 07:14.142
- START PICKING OUT
YOUR COSTUME.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.685
- COSTUME?
- YOU CAN'T GET IN WITHOUT ONE.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.061
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
[kisses]

07:17.145 --> 07:19.689
OH, HEY, LADIES.

07:19.772 --> 07:25.111
"LIVE LONG AND PROSPER."

07:31.742 --> 07:33.369
- HERE'S THE DEAL.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.705
I HAVE FANTASIZED
ABOUT BEING

07:35.788 --> 07:38.374
WITH A HOT HERO FIREMAN
FOR SO LONG,

07:38.457 --> 07:41.043
SO WHAT IF HE HAS
A BUMPER STICKER

07:41.127 --> 07:44.672
THAT READS, "MY OTHER CAR
IS THE <i> ENTERPRISE."</i>

07:46.632 --> 07:48.092
[computer beeps]

07:48.176 --> 07:50.219
- OH, NO.
ANOTHER PICTURE OF EMMET.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.554
- WOULD YOU STOP LOOKING
AT THAT?

07:51.637 --> 07:52.680
IT'S JUST DRIVING YOU CRAZY.

07:52.763 --> 07:53.890
- OH,
NOW HE'S GOT HIS ARMS

07:53.973 --> 07:55.683
AROUND THIS GORGEOUS,
YOUNG THING.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.727
- THAT'S ZOE SALDANA.

07:57.810 --> 08:02.356
NEYTIRI IN AVATAR AND UHURA
IN THE <i> STAR TREK</i> REBOOT.

08:06.068 --> 08:10.573
I LIKED ME BETTER
BEFORE I KNEW THESE THINGS.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.908
- IT'S JUST A PHOTO.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.326
YOU HAVE NO PROOF
THAT ANYTHING'S GOING ON.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.785
- OH, I WISH
I COULD JUST HOP

08:14.869 --> 08:16.871
ON THE NEXT PLANE TO VENICE,
SPY ON HIM,

08:16.954 --> 08:18.581
AND FIND OUT
IF I CAN TRUST HIM.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.960
- OR YOU COULD JUST DECIDE
TO TRUST HIM.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.545
- SAVE YOUR BREATH,
MELANIE.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.422
SHE'S GOT HER CRAZY EYES.
SHE CAN'T EVEN HEAR YOU.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.636
YOU KNOW, IN THE 15TH SEASON
OF <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW,</i>

08:32.720 --> 08:35.181
I WAS WHEELED INTO MY CHEATING
BOYFRIEND'S HOTEL ROOM,

08:35.264 --> 08:36.682
HIDDEN
IN A ROOM SERVICE CART.

08:36.765 --> 08:39.143
OH,
IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.812
- VICTORIA, DOESN'T THAT SOUND
A LITTLE NUTTY, EVEN TO YOU?

08:41.895 --> 08:44.649
- MAYBE.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.609
BUT STILL, I HAVE SEVEN HOURS
ON THE PLANE

08:46.692 --> 08:49.070
TO COME UP
WITH A BETTER ONE.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.155
ALTHOUGH, ADJUSTING
FOR TWO AMBIEN AND A VODKA,

08:51.239 --> 08:54.116
IT'S MORE LIKE TEN MINUTES.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.452
BUT HEY, I SLAPPED THIS ONE
TOGETHER FAST ENOUGH.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.288
IT'S ALL GONNA BE FINE.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.923
- OH, SUGAR,
IT'S THE COPS!

09:09.006 --> 09:11.133
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

09:11.217 --> 09:12.134
- NOTHING,
I'M DRIVING

09:12.218 --> 09:16.514
A SAFE 20 MILES PER HOUR
BELOW THE SPEED LIMIT.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.266
I'M SCARED.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.059
- JUST PLAY IT COOL.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.103
FOLLOW MY LEAD.
[knock on window]

09:24.355 --> 09:25.481
GOOD EVENING,
OFFICER.

09:25.564 --> 09:26.816
- GOOD EVENING,
LADIES.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.902
- THE STUFF
IS IN THE TRUNK.

09:31.612 --> 09:35.533
- SHE'S DELIRIOUS
WITH JOY...

09:35.616 --> 09:40.997
FOR THE MILEAGE
THIS PRIUS IS GETTING.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.040
- I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE A LOOK, MA'AM.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.336
- WAY TO PLAY IT COOL.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.839
- I DON'T DO WELL
UNDER PRESSURE,

09:49.922 --> 09:51.674
AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA SEND US
TO JAIL,

09:51.757 --> 09:55.094
WHERE I ALSO DON'T THINK
I'LL DO WELL.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.972
- IT'S NOT SO BAD.
I'VE BEEN IN PRISON.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.182
- IT CHANGED YOU, ELKA.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.978
IT CHANGED YOU.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.354
- PIPE DOWN.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.024
I THINK I RECOGNIZE
THIS GUY'S NAME.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.193
- LADIES, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE YOU

10:11.277 --> 10:12.194
DOWN TO THE STATION.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.029
STEP OUT OF THE CAR,
PLEASE.

10:13.112 --> 10:17.366
- UM, OFFICER DAVENPORT, IS IT?
- YEAH.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.660
- DO YOU HAVE A GRANDMOTHER
NAMED CLAIRE?

10:19.744 --> 10:21.495
- I DO.
- [chuckles]

10:21.579 --> 10:23.664
GIVE HER A CALL.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.501
TELL HER
YOU PULLED OVER ELKA.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.050
- AWW, I LOVE HER, ALEC.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.719
JUST TODAY AT THE RIFLE RANGE
I WAS THINKING,

10:36.802 --> 10:38.554
HOW ARE WE GONNA MOVE ON
WITH OUR LIVES?

10:38.637 --> 10:41.015
BUT NOW,

10:41.098 --> 10:43.642
YOU'VE MADE US
A FAMILY AGAIN.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.562
- YOU KISSED HER?

10:46.645 --> 10:48.105
- SHE KISSED ME.
- BUT THERE WAS KISSING.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.899
I HAVEN'T EVEN
KISSED YOU YET.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.067
- I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

10:51.150 --> 10:54.362
- NO!
NOT WHILE I'M A GARGOYLE.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.197
FIRST KISSES
ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.741
I'VE EVEN FANTASIZED
ABOUT OUR FIRST KISS.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.117
- REALLY?

11:00.201 --> 11:02.703
SO TELL ME
ABOUT THIS FANTASY KISS.

11:02.787 --> 11:06.415
- OH, IT'S SO SILLY,
IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.378
IT'S YOU AND ME
ON A ROOFTOP GARDEN IN PARIS

11:10.461 --> 11:13.381
WITH TWINKLY LIGHTS
AND FRENCH MUSIC

11:13.464 --> 11:14.924
AND THE EIFFEL TOWER
IN THE DISTANCE,

11:15.007 --> 11:18.302
THE SCENT OF FRESH LAVENDER
IN THE AIR.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.929
SO NOT DRESSED
IN A SWEATY COSTUME

11:20.012 --> 11:22.473
WITH A CONCRETE FACE.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.309
- WELL, I'D STILL JACKHAMMER
THAT CONCRETE.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.771
BOY, THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.149
I MEANT
I'D STILL KISS YOU.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.944
TENDERLY.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.446
[phone chimes]

11:37.530 --> 11:38.447
[sighs]

11:38.531 --> 11:40.616
THE DOTHRAKIS ARE FIGHTING
WITH THE TEAMSTERS

11:40.699 --> 11:42.618
OVER WHO SHOULD LOAD
THE THRONE OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS

11:42.701 --> 11:43.994
INTO THE MINIVAN.
- [laughs]

11:44.078 --> 11:46.455
- SOUNDS LIKE A JOB
FOR CAPTAIN INVINCIBLE.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.040
BACK IN A FLASH.

11:48.124 --> 11:48.833
- AND TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.126
MAYBE I CAN FIND
AN OLD CATHEDRAL

11:50.209 --> 11:53.379
TO COOL OFF IN.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.882
AH.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.428
[cat meows]

12:02.221 --> 12:03.806
- HEY, WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

12:03.889 --> 12:05.683
NO, NO, NO.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.268
PLEASE DON'T GO OUT THERE!

12:07.351 --> 12:08.978
KITTY, KITTY, KITTY.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.439
- CLOSE THAT WINDOW!
MY CAT'S IN HERE.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.149
- NO,
SHE'S ON THE LEDGE.

12:13.232 --> 12:13.858
I DIDN'T KNOW.
I'M SO SORRY.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.360
- WHAT?
- I D--

12:16.444 --> 12:18.446
- WELL, GO OUT THERE
AND GET HER.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.240
- THAT'S A 20-STORY DROP.
THESE ARE NOT REAL WINGS.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.491
[yells]

12:22.575 --> 12:24.535
OH, OKAY!
I'M GOING.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.666
[knock on door]

12:30.750 --> 12:33.252
- ROOM SERVICE.
-<i> AVANTI.</i>

12:37.298 --> 12:38.716
- EMMET,
WHAT'S WITH ROOM SERVICE?

12:38.799 --> 12:40.009
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING OUT.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.846
THE WHOLE TOWN'S FULL
OF HOT WOMEN.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.140
- WELL, I'M AFRAID
YOU'LL HAVE TO FLY SOLO

12:46.223 --> 12:47.349
FROM HERE ON, JASON.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.019
THING IS,
I'M WITH SOMEONE NOW.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.188
VICTORIA CHASE.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.691
- WHO'S THAT?

12:55.774 --> 12:57.651
- A WONDERFUL ACTRESS
I MET IN CLEVELAND.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.653
NEVER BEEN WITH ANYONE
LIKE HER.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.697
WE'RE...EQUALS,
YOU KNOW?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.532
I RESPECT HER,
I TRUST HER.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.202
AND WELL, DAMN IT,

13:06.285 --> 13:08.204
I THINK
I MIGHT LOVE HER.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.705
- [gasps]

13:09.788 --> 13:12.374
- IN FACT,
I'M QUITE DESPERATE

13:12.458 --> 13:14.001
TO HEAR HER VOICE
RIGHT NOW.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.211
I'M GOING TO CALL HER.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.723
- COME ON, KITTY.
[cat meows]

13:27.806 --> 13:29.433
KITTY. NO, NO, NO.
OKAY.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.060
KITTY, KITTY. YEAH, GO INSIDE.
GO INSIDE.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.354
- YOU'RE SCARING HER!
- WHAT--

13:33.437 --> 13:34.897
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.357
- YOU WEREN'T GETTING IT DONE.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.858
[cat meows]

13:37.942 --> 13:39.610
- OH, LOOK.
SHE'S SAFE.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.571
WELL, WE CAN GO BACK IN.
- NO, WE CAN'T.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.406
- WHY?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.033
- I WAS SO WORRIED
ABOUT MY CAT,

13:46.116 --> 13:49.245
I FORGOT I AM DEATHLY AFRAID
OF HEIGHTS.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.080
- IT'S OKAY,
'CAUSE LOOK,

13:51.163 --> 13:52.414
THE WINDOW'S
NOT THAT FAR AWAY.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.667
- AAH!
IF I MOVE, I'LL JUMP!

13:54.750 --> 13:56.877
THAT'S PART OF THE PHOBIA,
THAT I'LL JUMP.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.589
I REALLY WILL.
I'LL JUMP.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.882
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.594
- CHLOE!
NO, NO, DON'T JUMP!

14:05.678 --> 14:07.471
MELANIE, WHY DID YOU TELL HER
ABOUT US?

14:07.555 --> 14:11.100
- "US"?
YOU TWO ARE TOGETHER?

14:11.183 --> 14:15.145
- WE'RE ON THE LEDGE
BECAUSE CHLOE'S NEW CAT GOT OUT.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.905
- NICE WORK BACK THERE,
ELKA,

14:24.989 --> 14:26.615
PLAYING THE GRANDMA CARD.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.119
I DON'T WANT TO BE
SOMEONE'S BITCH IN PRISON.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.959
BY THE WAY,
THANKS FOR LOANING ME <i> OZ.</i>

14:37.042 --> 14:39.461
- SOME PRETTY GRITTY STUFF.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.590
OF COURSE, I LIVED IT.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.092
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SURVIVED
BEING LOCKED UP.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.970
- THE SECRET IS,
THE FIRST DAY YOU'RE IN,

14:48.053 --> 14:49.972
YOU STEAL A DINING HALL TRAY

14:50.055 --> 14:53.475
AND TAKE OUT THE BIGGEST CON
IN THE YARD.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.893
- IS THAT WHAT YOU DID?

14:54.977 --> 14:56.478
- YUP.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.732
JOY STILL DOESN'T KNOW
IT WAS ME.

15:02.192 --> 15:05.029
- HI.
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

15:05.112 --> 15:08.949
- HELP!
PERVERT!

15:09.033 --> 15:10.951
- JOY, STOP, STOP!

15:11.035 --> 15:13.454
IT'S ME.
- SEAN?

15:13.537 --> 15:15.497
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING
AS A PRINCE.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.415
- I AM.

15:16.498 --> 15:20.044
PRINCE SILVERSADDLE,
THE STRONGEST PONY

15:20.127 --> 15:22.004
IN ALL OF EQUESTRIA.

15:22.087 --> 15:25.716
- EQUESTRIA?
IS THAT A <i> STAR TREK</i> THING?

15:25.799 --> 15:27.343
- [laughs]
YOU'RE ADORABLE.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.678
EQUESTRIA IS THE MAGICAL LAND

15:29.762 --> 15:33.307
OF <i> MY LITTLE PONY:</i>
<i>FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC.</i>

15:33.390 --> 15:36.518
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
THE CARTOON FOR LITTLE GIRLS?

15:36.602 --> 15:39.647
- IT'S FOR PEOPLE
OF ALL AGES.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.482
DON'T LOOK SO CONCERNED.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.567
I'M JUST ONE
OF A WHOLE COMMUNITY OF GUYS

15:43.651 --> 15:45.069
WHO ARE DEVOTED
TO <i> MY LITTLE PONY.</i>

15:45.152 --> 15:47.738
WE'RE CALLED BRONIES.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.823
AND WE GET TOGETHER,
WE DRESS UP,

15:49.907 --> 15:51.992
WE BRONY OUT.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.578
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.331
- [chuckles]
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.041
- AH, IT'S JUST
'CAUSE IT'S NEW TO YOU.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.501
LOOK, IT'S ALL POSITIVE.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.544
WE CELEBRATE <i> MY LITTLE PONY'S</i>
BEAUTIFUL ETHOS

16:02.628 --> 16:04.380
OF FRIENDSHIP, CARING,

16:04.463 --> 16:06.548
LEARNING TO VALUE PEOPLE
DIFFERENT THAN OURSELVES.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.842
YOU'RE AGAINST ALL THAT?

16:08.926 --> 16:12.221
- SOME OF IT.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.305
- GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON

16:13.389 --> 16:15.516
WHY I SHOULDN'T PUSH YOU
OFF THIS LEDGE RIGHT NOW.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.893
- UM, PEOPLE ARE WATCHING
DOWN THERE.

16:17.976 --> 16:19.561
THIS COSTUME IS A RENTAL?

16:19.645 --> 16:21.480
YOU'LL HAVE TERRIBLE ROOTS
IN PRISON.

16:21.563 --> 16:22.856
- OH, STOP SNIVELING.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.733
SO...

16:24.817 --> 16:26.443
MEXICO?
THAT WAS NOTHING?

16:26.527 --> 16:27.945
- THAT WAS GRIEF.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.406
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LEAD YOU ON,
CHLOE, I'M SORRY.

16:30.489 --> 16:34.368
- I'M SORRY TOO.
- SHUT UP, YOU'RE FIRED.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.121
- THIS IS NOT HER FAULT.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.540
YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART THAT
WE BROKE UP A LONG TIME AGO.

16:39.623 --> 16:43.585
- I KNOW,
AND IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.795
I NEVER SHOULD'VE CHEATED
ON YOU.

16:44.878 --> 16:45.754
- CHLOE.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.425
NO COUPLE BREAKS UP
OVER JUST ONE THING.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.718
MAYBE WE COULD JUST AGREE

16:50.801 --> 16:52.594
TO FORGIVE EACH OTHER
AND MOVE ON.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.597
- CAN WE MOVE ON QUICKLY?

16:55.681 --> 16:56.765
SHOO.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.728
I'M NOT A REAL GARGOYLE.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.104
- I MEAN,
HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT

17:02.187 --> 17:04.606
THAN A GUY WEARING A DOG MASK
TO A BROWNS GAME?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.900
IT'S ALL JUST FANTASY.

17:06.983 --> 17:10.487
LOOK, COME TO PARIS WITH ME.
- KEEP TALKING.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.615
- THERE'S AN INTERNATIONAL BRONY
CONVENTION THERE NEXT MONTH.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.617
- STOP TALKING.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.746
- WOULD IT CHANGE ANYTHING
IF I TOLD YOU

17:18.829 --> 17:21.123
THAT I WAS CORPORAL
OF THE FRIENDSHIP BRIGADE?

17:21.205 --> 17:24.126
- YES,
BUT NOT IN THE DIRECTION

17:24.209 --> 17:26.462
YOU WANT IT TO CHANGE.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.839
- SO THIS IS
A DEAL BREAKER FOR YOU?

17:28.922 --> 17:31.800
- IT'S KILLING ME,
BUT YES.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.887
I'M AFRAID SO.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.269
- PLEASE,
JUST TAKE MY HAND.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.228
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:43.312 --> 17:44.938
- MELANIE AND CHLOE ARE OUT
ON THE LEDGE.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.648
- WHAT?
- I CALLED 911.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.984
- I'M A FIREFIGHTER.
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.652
- OH, MY GOD,
BE CAREFUL!

17:50.736 --> 17:54.281
- OH, JOY,
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.494
- LADIES,
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.788
JUST STAY CALM.
- BUT I'M SCARED.

18:00.871 --> 18:05.000
- I GIVE YOU MY WORD
THAT I WILL RESCUE YOU BOTH.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.003
both: WOW.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.296
- MELANIE.

18:09.379 --> 18:12.299
- YEAH, IN A SEC.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.511
OH, OH, ALEC.
- I'LL HELP YOU IN.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.851
- JUST LOOK
INTO MY EYES.

18:22.935 --> 18:23.894
DO YOU TRUST ME?

18:23.977 --> 18:26.313
- YES.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.857
YOU'RE VERY GOOD-LOOKING.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.651
- AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.027
- ARE YOU SINGLE?

18:32.110 --> 18:34.363
- YES, I AM.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.906
- ME TOO.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.576
YOU'RE MY HERO.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.203
- LOOK AT HIM.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.248
MAYBE I MADE A MISTAKE.

18:44.331 --> 18:47.209
HE'S A BRONY,
YOU KNOW.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.211
- WHAT'S THAT?

18:49.294 --> 18:51.213
- I DRESS UP
IN A HORSE'S COSTUME

18:51.296 --> 18:54.842
AND GO TO CONVENTIONS
CELEBRATING <i> MY LITTLE PONY.</i>

18:54.925 --> 18:56.468
- OKAY.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.061
- OH, VICTORIA,
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

19:06.144 --> 19:09.273
HE ACTUALLY SAID HE LOVES YOU?
- YES.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.566
YOU KNOW,
I TOYED WITH THE IDEA

19:10.649 --> 19:11.942
OF POPPING OUT
AND SURPRISING HIM,

19:12.025 --> 19:16.321
BUT A RELATIONSHIP
HAS TO BE BUILT ON TRUST.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.076
SPYING HAS TAUGHT ME THAT.

19:21.159 --> 19:25.414
- OH, IT'S 8:00.
TO OUR POSTS.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.379
- YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.715
I'VE BEEN THINKING
OF KISSING YOU ALL NIGHT.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.551
- YEAH?
WHY HAVEN'T YOU?

19:37.634 --> 19:40.554
- WELL,
I WANT IT TO BE PERFECT.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.764
SO LET ME SEE
IF I REMEMBER.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.267
GARDEN, TWINKLE LIGHTS...

19:45.350 --> 19:48.896
[snaps fingers]
- [gasps]

19:48.979 --> 19:52.232
- AND FRENCH MUSIC.
[snaps fingers]

19:52.316 --> 19:54.234
[French music]

19:54.318 --> 19:57.321
AND WHAT WAS THAT VIEW
IN THE DISTANCE?

19:57.404 --> 20:01.241
- THE EIFFEL TOWER?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.126
- AND THE SCENT OF...

20:11.209 --> 20:13.795
