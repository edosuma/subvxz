Ooh...

00:26.999 --> 00:27.899
Look at me.

00:27.999 --> 00:28.609
I am a fashion

00:28.709 --> 00:31.626
blunder,
a <i>Mademoiselle</i>"don't."

00:32.459 --> 00:33.900
Oh, my God.
You lost your powers?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Can't lose what you never had.

00:36.334 --> 00:40.109
I hate when she plays
astral games. Marco!

00:40.209 --> 00:42.000
Polo!

00:47.209 --> 00:48.120
What were you doing down there?

00:48.130 --> 00:52.776
Practicing, trying to use
telekinesis in astral mode.

00:52.876 --> 00:55.275
Hmm... witch exercises.
Since when?

00:55.375 --> 00:57.734
Since I studied up
on Belthazor.

00:57.834 --> 00:59.692
The Triad couldn't
have sent us

00:59.792 --> 01:01.067
a worse demon.

01:01.167 --> 01:02.401
PHOEBE:
Or one with worse skin.

01:02.501 --> 01:05.776
I would hate to find myself
alone with this guy.

01:05.876 --> 01:07.025
Yeah, well,
you wouldn't

01:07.125 --> 01:08.275
last long, none of us would.

01:08.375 --> 01:12.317
That's why I'm trying to teach
my astral self how to fight.

01:12.417 --> 01:13.942
(<i>groans</i>)

01:14.042 --> 01:16.818
I have a date with Cole.

01:16.918 --> 01:19.234
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

01:19.334 --> 01:20.818
It's a lunch date.

01:20.918 --> 01:21.899
So?

01:21.999 --> 01:23.776
So, it's not a good sign.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.899
Lunch is a cheap
imitation of dinner.

01:25.999 --> 01:28.109
That's why it has
it's own special menu.

01:28.209 --> 01:29.442
And, you know,
we kissed last week,

01:29.542 --> 01:32.150
we should be on to dinner
and candlelight by now.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.317
Well, may... Oh!

01:33.417 --> 01:36.067
I can't believe you haven't
taken care of that tooth.

01:36.167 --> 01:39.818
Yeah, well, I have a dentist
appointment in an hour.

01:39.918 --> 01:42.109
Good.
I hate to see you so miserable.

01:42.209 --> 01:44.584
Me, too.

Okay, go ahead.

02:19.834 --> 02:21.983
That way.

02:22.083 --> 02:23.317

PRUE:
Hey, did you cast any

02:32.999 --> 02:35.025
"give me a sign" spells lately?

02:35.125 --> 02:35.899
No, why?

02:35.999 --> 02:36.818
I don't know,

02:36.918 --> 02:37.484
it just seems like

02:37.584 --> 02:40.526
somebody's dropping signs
right in front of me, literally.

02:40.626 --> 02:42.109
Prue, you need
to ignore the signs

02:42.209 --> 02:43.859
and get yourself into a dentist.

02:43.959 --> 02:45.859
Yeah, I know.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.609
Hold it.

02:47.709 --> 02:48.899
Uh, hello? Prue?

02:48.999 --> 02:52.751
Uh, I'll call you back.

02:59.209 --> 02:59.776
Excuse me.

02:59.876 --> 03:01.776
You're with Social
Services, right?

03:01.876 --> 03:02.983
No, why?

03:03.083 --> 03:05.776
The guy won't come out
of his loft up there,

03:05.876 --> 03:07.899
and we're supposed
to start demolition today.

03:07.999 --> 03:08.899
Someone still lives here?

03:08.999 --> 03:10.234
Well, if you can
call it that.

03:10.334 --> 03:15.167
Poor guy says he hasn't
stepped outside in four years.

03:36.459 --> 03:39.042
Hello?

03:40.334 --> 03:41.818
MAN:
Close the door.

03:41.918 --> 03:42.899
Go away!

03:42.999 --> 03:44.692
I just want to talk.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.999
Please...
go away.

03:57.459 --> 03:59.899
No! Don't! Don't!

03:59.999 --> 04:01.526
Don't come
any closer!

04:01.626 --> 04:03.776
Are you hurt?

04:03.876 --> 04:05.275
My head.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.234
It's exploding.

04:07.334 --> 04:10.317
The pain...
you're letting it in!

04:10.417 --> 04:11.776
What pain?

04:11.876 --> 04:12.900
Everyone's pain,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.317
from the city and the streets...

04:15.417 --> 04:19.067
I feel it...
I feel all of it!

04:19.166 --> 04:20.608
I won't hurt you.

04:20.709 --> 04:23.667
You are hurting me.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.150
Your pity,
it's like razors inside.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.359
Please, I can...

04:30.459 --> 04:32.818
Oh, your tooth!
I feel your tooth!

04:32.918 --> 04:34.859
All your pain!

04:34.959 --> 04:35.899
I can't stand it!

04:35.999 --> 04:39.626
Why didn't you
just go when I asked?!

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
(<i>sobbing</i>)

05:40.584 --> 05:43.567
I just can't believe you
introduced me as a friend.

05:43.667 --> 05:44.287
Okay, a social
malfunction.

05:44.297 --> 05:45.942
I hadn't seen
the woman in years.

05:46.042 --> 05:46.899
I'm-I'm sorry.

05:46.999 --> 05:48.192
I lost my wings for you.

05:48.292 --> 05:49.651
You know,
I've hurled my body

05:49.751 --> 05:50.900
into the path
of oncoming demons.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.818
You wanted heaven,
I took you there, literally.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.317
I am more

05:55.417 --> 05:56.234
than a "friend."

05:56.334 --> 05:58.401
I know, but if I had
introduced you as my fiancÃ©,

05:58.501 --> 05:59.818
she would have asked
how we met,

05:59.918 --> 06:00.776
when we're getting
married,

06:00.876 --> 06:01.899
where the hell
my ring is,

06:01.999 --> 06:03.692
questions that
I can't answer, now can I?

06:03.792 --> 06:06.942
I suppose that's how
I became a doctor, too.

06:07.042 --> 06:07.942
Leo, that's what you were.

06:08.042 --> 06:10.359
Look, what am I supposed
to tell people,

06:10.459 --> 06:12.067
that I'm engaged
to a Whitelighter?

06:12.167 --> 06:13.109
Sometimes
being magical

06:13.209 --> 06:15.899
kinda takes the magic
right out of things.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.899
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

06:17.999 --> 06:19.734
Oh, come on,
don't you sometimes?

06:19.834 --> 06:21.899
Every now and then,
I just want to feel

06:21.999 --> 06:24.818
what it's like
to live in the real world.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.709
(<i>door closing</i>)

06:28.709 --> 06:31.401
Hey.

06:31.501 --> 06:32.983
What are you two doing together?

06:33.083 --> 06:35.150
Uh, Cole pulled
up behind me.

06:35.250 --> 06:36.818
Good timing.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.526
(<i>chuckles</i>)

06:38.626 --> 06:40.567
Hey, look.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.900
It's my lunch date.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.899
COLE:
Sorry I'm late.

06:42.999 --> 06:44.692
I got held up
on a case.

06:44.792 --> 06:45.899
You look... amazing.

06:45.999 --> 06:48.150
It's all part of
my master plan.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.109
Uh, Phoebe,
I wanted to talk

06:50.209 --> 06:52.109
to you about the signs...

06:52.209 --> 06:53.234
Uh...

06:53.334 --> 06:53.899
the assignment

06:53.999 --> 06:56.067
that we were talking about
on the phone.

06:56.167 --> 06:57.651
Where did it lead?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.150
To this incredibly tragic guy
who's scared

06:59.250 --> 07:00.899
to leave his own home,
which might be okay

07:00.999 --> 07:02.899
if it weren't
about to be torn down.

07:02.999 --> 07:04.734
Was there a social
worker there?

07:04.834 --> 07:05.401
No, but
I was told

07:05.501 --> 07:06.942
that a deputy was going
there this afternoon

07:07.042 --> 07:09.442
to evict him,
and he has no place to go.

07:09.542 --> 07:12.899
Let me, um, make a call,

07:12.999 --> 07:14.275
see what
I can do.

07:14.375 --> 07:15.899
Kitchen.

07:15.999 --> 07:16.776
Thank you.

07:16.876 --> 07:18.192
(<i>clears throat</i>)

(<i>groans</i>)

07:28.792 --> 07:31.501
(<i>phone beeping</i>)

07:33.209 --> 07:35.859
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.442
Where are you going?

07:37.542 --> 07:38.776
We agreed
no more

07:38.876 --> 07:41.109
Triad reports,
not until my plan succeeds.

07:41.209 --> 07:45.999
I can't be associated with
any more failed attempts.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.859
Phoebe.

07:47.959 --> 07:49.025
Hey.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.899
I just needed some aspirin.

07:50.999 --> 07:53.459
Prue has a toothache.

07:56.999 --> 07:58.167
Water...

08:00.999 --> 08:01.526
You okay?

08:01.626 --> 08:05.999
Yeah, yeah...
just, uh, got disconnected.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.567
Prue followed my signs.

08:10.667 --> 08:11.692
The plan
will work.

08:11.792 --> 08:15.834
If it doesn't, then you can
rat me out to the Triad.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.567
(<i>dialing</i>)

08:22.667 --> 08:23.899
Based on everything
you said, Prue,

08:23.999 --> 08:26.651
it sounds like your
shut-in's a future empath.

08:26.751 --> 08:27.275
An empath?

08:27.375 --> 08:29.776
And me without
my dictionary.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.150
They're mortals
who can actually feel

08:32.250 --> 08:33.567
what other people feel.

08:33.667 --> 08:34.899
It's a rare gift.

08:34.999 --> 08:37.359
When they die,
they often return

08:37.458 --> 08:39.234
to earth as empaths,

08:39.333 --> 08:41.067
where they blend
into society

08:41.167 --> 08:42.400
as counselors,

08:42.501 --> 08:43.192
elders, teachers.

08:43.292 --> 08:45.942
They use their sensitivity
to guide mortals,

08:46.042 --> 08:47.899
ease their pain,
even heal them.

08:47.999 --> 08:51.734
No, I don't think this guy
would look at it as a gift.

08:51.834 --> 08:53.609
He's one big raw nerve ending.

08:53.709 --> 08:56.942
You should have seen how
he reacted to my toothache.

08:57.042 --> 08:58.734
Well, it could be he's
rejecting his gift,

08:58.834 --> 09:01.275
fighting the emotions he feels
instead of embracing them.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.942
PIPER:
Well, he sure sounds

09:03.042 --> 09:03.899
like an innocent to me.

09:03.999 --> 09:04.899
LEO:
It would be
a shame to lose

09:04.999 --> 09:06.899
a future empath
and all the good he'll do.

09:06.999 --> 09:07.692
I care less about

09:07.792 --> 09:09.401
his after life
than his current one.

09:09.501 --> 09:11.899
I know what it's like
to receive a power

09:11.999 --> 09:14.234
that you just do not understand.

09:14.334 --> 09:15.037
What I don't understand

09:15.047 --> 09:16.609
is who sent the signs
that you followed?

09:16.709 --> 09:18.234
LEO:
It's hard to say,
it could be them,

09:18.334 --> 09:19.484
it could be...

09:19.584 --> 09:20.751
Cole.

09:21.542 --> 09:23.317
I got a guy at Housing Authority

09:23.417 --> 09:24.983
who'll relocate
your shut-in

09:25.083 --> 09:26.959
if he leaves
voluntarily.

09:27.999 --> 09:28.899
Here's my card.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.150
Have him page me.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.526
Thanks.
All right.

09:32.626 --> 09:32.983
Uh, Prue,

09:33.083 --> 09:34.442
do you want
us to go with you?

09:34.542 --> 09:35.567
No, this guy can barely deal

09:35.667 --> 09:38.999
with one person,
let alone three, but thank you.

09:39.876 --> 09:41.900
Okay then,

09:42.000 --> 09:42.900
Lunch would be great.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.899
Would you mind
if we join you?

09:44.999 --> 09:45.734
I mean, it'd be great--

in the real world?

09:47.999 --> 09:51.109
What could
be greater?

understand!

you know that deputy
is here to arrest you

11:37.334 --> 11:38.651
for civil disobedience.

11:38.751 --> 11:42.651
I'll die if they put me in jail.

11:42.751 --> 11:43.899
I believe you.

11:43.999 --> 11:45.692
That's why
I came back,

11:45.792 --> 11:46.734
to find you a new home.

11:46.834 --> 11:48.899
But you have
to leave here with me now.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.567
I can't. I can't go outside.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.692
(<i>sobbing</i>)

11:54.792 --> 11:55.651
Vince,

11:55.751 --> 11:57.567
I know
what it's like,

11:57.667 --> 11:59.899
I know what it's like
to have a gift

11:59.999 --> 12:00.899
that you can't control,

12:00.999 --> 12:02.942
that you
never asked for.

12:03.042 --> 12:05.442
And living with that is hard,
really hard.

12:05.542 --> 12:06.734
Don't tell me

12:06.834 --> 12:07.899
what's hard.

12:07.999 --> 12:10.999
You avoid your pain, I feel it.

12:12.125 --> 12:16.567
Right, then let's talk about...
the blessings,

12:16.667 --> 12:18.025
the rewards
that come

12:18.125 --> 12:19.109
with having that gift.

12:19.209 --> 12:21.442
I mean, you can't even
begin to...

12:21.542 --> 12:22.818
Words.

12:22.918 --> 12:24.275
Just empty words!

12:24.375 --> 12:27.109
You don't feel them
in your heart,

12:27.209 --> 12:29.234
I-I... I know.

12:29.334 --> 12:31.734
You feel... fear

12:31.834 --> 12:35.359
and panic,
because something's

12:35.459 --> 12:36.234
coming for you.

12:36.334 --> 12:39.067
Something you're afraid
you can't stop.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.484
These the blessings

12:41.584 --> 12:44.899
you want me
to feel thankful for?

12:44.999 --> 12:46.150
I'm sorry.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.859
Yes, you are.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.899
You are sorry.

12:49.999 --> 12:52.150
And confused

12:52.250 --> 12:54.234
and afraid.

12:54.334 --> 12:55.275
And it's drowning me alive!

12:55.375 --> 12:57.067
(<i>pounding at door</i>)
(<i>gasping</i>)

12:57.167 --> 12:57.734
Deputy!

12:57.834 --> 12:58.983
Time's up.
Open the door!

12:59.083 --> 13:00.859
VINCE:
Can't you see?

13:00.959 --> 13:02.234
This is not a gift.

13:02.334 --> 13:02.983
This is a curse.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.567
I am cursed
to feel everything

13:05.667 --> 13:07.025
all the time from everyone.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.899
I can't go outside
that door, not now! Not ever!

13:10.999 --> 13:12.459
I'm coming in!

13:15.792 --> 13:17.250
Hey.

13:17.792 --> 13:19.025
How'd you do that?

13:19.125 --> 13:22.542
I was sent here to help you
and that's what I'm gonna do.

13:23.417 --> 13:25.025
Free the empath,

13:25.125 --> 13:27.067
release his gift,

13:27.167 --> 13:29.999
let his pain be cast adrift.

13:33.999 --> 13:36.609
DEPUTY:
What the hell's the
matter with you people?

13:36.709 --> 13:40.899
Sorry, Deputy, that door
stuck on me, too.

13:40.999 --> 13:43.484
He's ready now.

13:43.584 --> 13:44.567
But how?

13:44.667 --> 13:47.859
We'll talk later.

13:47.959 --> 13:49.899
Um... this is the DA.

13:49.999 --> 13:51.150
Page him.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.692
He'll find a place
for you to go.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.609
Thank you.

13:54.709 --> 13:59.042
You don't know
what you just did for me.

14:05.999 --> 14:08.209
Let's get you out of this dump.

14:10.542 --> 14:11.317
What's the matter with you?

14:11.417 --> 14:15.359
Just wondering what
you're feeling right now.

14:15.459 --> 14:17.209
Yeah, why's that?

14:17.501 --> 14:19.401
(<i>hissing</i>)

14:19.501 --> 14:21.125
Because...

14:22.999 --> 14:26.209
I can't feel a thing.

14:42.999 --> 14:44.167
So...

14:45.667 --> 14:47.526
How 'bout those Niners?

14:47.626 --> 14:49.734
The what?
PHOEBE:
The Niners.

14:49.834 --> 14:50.899
The Forty-Niners.

14:50.999 --> 14:51.899
The football team.

14:51.999 --> 14:55.359
You don't follow
football?

14:55.459 --> 14:58.442
He isn't human.

14:58.542 --> 14:59.526
Oh.

14:59.626 --> 15:01.250
(<i>coughs</i>)
You okay?

15:02.459 --> 15:04.999
Check.

15:06.918 --> 15:08.334
Um, we're going to be
right back.

15:17.751 --> 15:18.484
Phoebe, I know
you're upset

15:18.584 --> 15:20.317
Leo crashed your
lunch date, but...

15:20.417 --> 15:21.899
No, it's not that.

15:21.999 --> 15:24.401
Cole is pulling away
from me again.

15:24.501 --> 15:25.899
I can see it.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.484
Premonition?

15:27.584 --> 15:29.192
Intuition.

15:29.292 --> 15:30.899
Oh.

15:30.999 --> 15:33.692
Look, Cole,
before the girls get back,

15:33.792 --> 15:34.942
I need to tell you
something.

15:35.042 --> 15:36.899
What, spinach
in my teeth?

15:36.999 --> 15:37.899
Huh?

15:37.999 --> 15:38.899
Oh, no, no.

15:38.999 --> 15:41.192
It, uh, it has to do
with Phoebe.

15:41.292 --> 15:45.692
Um, well, I just feel
very protective of her.

15:45.792 --> 15:46.899
We all do.

15:46.999 --> 15:48.900
You know,
she's a sweetie.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.899
Um... she's been
through a lot,

15:50.999 --> 15:52.359
a lot of loss.

15:52.459 --> 15:53.484
I sense that.

15:53.584 --> 15:55.651
Well, she's into you.
I-I can tell.

15:55.751 --> 15:59.192
Uh, whatever your intentions
are, I just...

15:59.292 --> 16:00.692
I want you to be straight
with her, okay,

16:00.792 --> 16:03.626
and I don't want
to see her get hurt.

16:04.209 --> 16:06.042
Heaven forbid.

16:06.709 --> 16:07.526
PHOEBE:
Hey, what did we miss?

16:07.626 --> 16:09.484
Leo was just giving me

16:09.584 --> 16:10.609
investment advice.

16:10.709 --> 16:11.899
PIPER:
He was?
Yeah.

16:11.999 --> 16:14.125
Really?
COLE:
Uh-huh.

16:15.167 --> 16:16.899
Oh.

16:16.999 --> 16:19.042
Why don't we
split this?

16:20.250 --> 16:23.359
Oh, honey, did
you forget your
wallet again?

16:23.459 --> 16:24.999
I guess so.

16:26.501 --> 16:30.459
I got it.
!
(<i>pager beeping</i>)

16:32.167 --> 16:33.999
(<i>sighs</i>)

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
I have to take this.

16:37.999 --> 16:40.250
Forgive me.

16:47.999 --> 16:50.067
Belthazor.

16:50.167 --> 16:50.942
Got your page.

16:51.042 --> 16:54.192
VINCE:
I owe you for sending me
the witch.

16:54.292 --> 16:56.317
It went down just like you said.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.401
Thanks.

16:58.501 --> 17:02.067
You made physical contact
during the spell?

17:02.167 --> 17:03.401
(<i>zipping bag</i>)

17:03.501 --> 17:05.776
I could feel
the empathic cancer

17:05.876 --> 17:07.898
pass out of me
and right into her.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.983
How did you know
that would happen?

17:10.083 --> 17:12.416
That's how you
got it, isn't it?

17:13.459 --> 17:15.898
How long does she have?

17:15.999 --> 17:17.275
She's a mortal.

17:17.375 --> 17:20.818
She won't be able to fight it
like a demon can.

17:20.917 --> 17:23.067
I give her a day
until the weight

17:23.166 --> 17:25.898
of human emotion
crushes her.

17:25.999 --> 17:27.692
You'll enjoy
watching it.

17:27.791 --> 17:30.275
I'll be out of town.

17:30.375 --> 17:31.651
I don't need to see

17:31.751 --> 17:34.667
the other two suffer
the loss of their sister.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.899
Compassion?

17:37.999 --> 17:39.818
From you, Belthazor?

17:39.918 --> 17:41.899
I think maybe
you've been undercover

17:41.999 --> 17:43.275
a little too long.

17:43.375 --> 17:44.776
Not your concern.

17:44.876 --> 17:45.401
VINCE:
True.

17:45.501 --> 17:46.401
My only concern is the empath

17:46.501 --> 17:49.942
who cursed me: Father Thomas.

17:50.042 --> 17:54.125
And I know
just where to track him down.

17:57.042 --> 17:57.899
No.

17:57.999 --> 17:59.899
I can't risk
the witches

17:59.999 --> 18:02.651
finding you and reversing
their magic.

18:02.751 --> 18:03.484
You forget who I was

18:03.584 --> 18:06.192
before I was an
empath, Belthazor.

18:06.292 --> 18:08.192
I'm immune to
their powers.

18:08.292 --> 18:11.626
Maybe, but you're
not immune to mine.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.709
Understood.

18:22.792 --> 18:23.609
Look, I am really sorry

18:23.709 --> 18:25.692
that I missed my appointment
this morning, okay,

18:25.792 --> 18:27.275
but-but I-I couldn't get
out of work.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.983
Is there any way
that Dr. Timmons can fit me in?

18:30.083 --> 18:31.900
We are pretty
booked up.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.484
All right, but my tooth

18:33.584 --> 18:33.983
kills.

18:34.083 --> 18:34.899
I really need to...

18:34.999 --> 18:36.192
(<i>gasps</i>):
Ooh!
Peter!

18:36.292 --> 18:38.999
Are you okay,
Miss Halliwell?

18:40.375 --> 18:40.899
Yeah.

18:40.999 --> 18:43.942
Uh... that was my... tooth.

18:44.042 --> 18:48.317
I'm having a really,
really bad day 'cause it hurts

18:48.417 --> 18:49.025
a lot.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.692
Let me see if I can do anything.

18:50.792 --> 18:55.484
Thanks. I mean,
I really... appreciate it.

18:55.584 --> 18:58.275
I think that it's abscessed.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.109
(<i>laughing</i>):
I'm so sorry.

19:00.209 --> 19:01.109
I don't...

19:01.209 --> 19:02.900
do this, but it's
been hurting

19:03.000 --> 19:04.899
for a long...

19:04.999 --> 19:06.899
(<i>laughing</i>)

19:06.999 --> 19:08.734
Who are you guys
laughing at?

19:08.834 --> 19:10.025
(<i>laughing</i>)

19:10.125 --> 19:11.484
(<i>chuckling</i>)

19:11.584 --> 19:12.370
Here's Mrs.
Freeman's chart.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.899
That's, uh, just
the nitrous oxide

19:14.999 --> 19:16.626
at work, Mrs. Freeman.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.859
(<i>laughing</i>)

19:19.959 --> 19:22.651
Nitrous oxide? Laughing gas?

19:22.751 --> 19:24.375
(<i>laughing</i>)

19:27.417 --> 19:28.442
Uh...

19:28.542 --> 19:30.359
The best I can do

19:30.459 --> 19:32.192
is fit you in at 4:15.

19:32.292 --> 19:34.192
No. No, no, no, no.

19:34.292 --> 19:35.526
Tha-That-that's okay.

19:35.626 --> 19:38.292
I have to go.

19:40.667 --> 19:41.900
What did I do?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.692
Uh, you know what?

19:45.792 --> 19:49.192
Uh, is there
something wrong?

19:49.292 --> 19:50.442
No.

19:50.542 --> 19:51.899
It's just...

19:51.999 --> 19:54.651
you haven't said
anything

19:54.751 --> 19:56.999
since we left
the restaurant.

19:57.459 --> 19:59.709
A lot on my
mind, I guess.

20:00.459 --> 20:01.834
Work?

20:02.459 --> 20:04.999
Yeah, sort of.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.359
I don't know how
to say this...

20:07.459 --> 20:09.651
Uh-oh.

20:09.751 --> 20:14.401
Don't ever start a sentence
like that with a girl.

20:14.501 --> 20:15.609
You don't want
to see me

20:15.709 --> 20:17.292
anymore, do you?

20:18.709 --> 20:21.275
(<i>laughs</i>):
Right.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.526
I never accept a lunch date.

20:23.626 --> 20:24.734
It's got nothing
to do with you.

20:24.834 --> 20:28.609
I mean... how I
feel about you.

20:28.709 --> 20:30.109
I don't understand.

20:30.209 --> 20:31.834
It's complicated.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.442
I think that I deserve to know.

20:34.542 --> 20:37.292
I promise, you'll
understand soon.

20:37.834 --> 20:40.209
Maybe more than
you'd want to.

20:45.042 --> 20:47.250
Oh...

20:51.083 --> 20:52.317
Are you okay?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.567
Whoa. I haven't felt

20:54.667 --> 20:58.818
anything like that
since Andy was alive.

20:58.918 --> 21:00.025
Anything like what?

21:00.125 --> 21:03.401
Spinning into
infinity...

21:03.501 --> 21:05.275
You know, that, uh...

21:05.375 --> 21:09.609
headlong spiral that
steals your breath

21:09.709 --> 21:10.776
and stops your heart.

21:10.876 --> 21:13.959
Um, Prue, what the hell
are you talking about?

21:14.542 --> 21:16.150
Falling in love.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.651
Falling in love?

21:17.751 --> 21:18.899
Prue, I just
got dumped, okay?

21:18.999 --> 21:21.899
I'm trying to experience
a break-up here.

21:21.999 --> 21:23.818
Who's falling in love?

21:23.918 --> 21:24.401
Cole.

21:24.501 --> 21:27.692
Okay, you're
so off track...

21:27.792 --> 21:28.999
Oh!

21:29.667 --> 21:31.942
Wait. I felt that, too.

21:32.042 --> 21:34.067
Your heart just jumped,

21:34.167 --> 21:37.899
and... I felt it.

21:37.999 --> 21:40.709
You're falling
in love, too.

21:42.292 --> 21:44.792
Oh!

21:45.334 --> 21:46.859
We got a problem.

21:46.959 --> 21:49.899
Prue cast a spell to
remove Vince's pain.

21:49.999 --> 21:51.442
Who's Vince?
PHOEBE:
The shut-in.

21:51.542 --> 21:54.899
But, uh, I think--
and call it a hunch--

21:54.999 --> 21:58.484
that it backfired
and made Prue an empath.

21:58.584 --> 21:59.999
But what kind of hunch?

22:00.626 --> 22:01.859
PRUE/PIPER:
Ow!

22:01.959 --> 22:04.234
PRUE/PHOEBE:
Ooh!

22:04.334 --> 22:05.025
Uh-oh.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.692
Uh, okay,
I don't really know

22:06.792 --> 22:07.567
how it happened, all right?

22:07.667 --> 22:09.359
I-I... all I was
trying to do

22:09.459 --> 22:11.234
was help an innocent...

22:11.334 --> 22:13.626
Hey, what is that I'm feeling?

22:16.375 --> 22:17.334
You.

22:17.751 --> 22:19.192
You're feeling fear. Spill it.

22:19.292 --> 22:20.275
I... I'm afraid

22:20.375 --> 22:20.994
that you're in danger.

22:21.004 --> 22:22.734
You weren't meant
to receive this gift.

22:22.834 --> 22:23.401
You can't handle it.

22:23.501 --> 22:26.067
Okay, you're looking
at it all wrong.

22:26.167 --> 22:28.526
Okay, I was guided
to Vince, remember?

22:28.626 --> 22:30.317
Maybe I was meant
to have this gift.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.899
But, Prue, you're not an empath.
You're just a witch.

22:32.999 --> 22:36.776
Right. A witch whose power comes
from her emotions.

22:36.876 --> 22:38.275
All right, look,
I-I-I was looking

22:38.375 --> 22:38.899
for a power boost

22:38.999 --> 22:41.401
to fight Belthazor--
maybe this is it.

22:41.501 --> 22:42.275
Will you guys please

22:42.375 --> 22:43.899
stop being so negative?

22:43.999 --> 22:45.150
We didn't say anything.

22:45.250 --> 22:47.025
Yeah, but I can feel
all of your...

22:47.125 --> 22:49.792
(<i>shrieking</i>)

22:50.417 --> 22:51.067
What was that?

22:51.167 --> 22:53.042
I think I did it.

22:53.584 --> 22:54.859
It's just all
of your doubts

22:54.959 --> 22:55.746
are screaming in my head.

22:55.756 --> 22:57.359
I-I've got to get control
of this.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.692
<i>The Book of Shadows.</i>

22:58.792 --> 23:00.484
Maybe there's something
about empaths.

23:00.584 --> 23:01.651
Where are you going?

23:01.751 --> 23:02.150
To help you.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.317
Yeah, but you're
dying to see Cole.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.109
Stop that.
I did not say that.

23:06.209 --> 23:08.109
Phoebe, go to
him, all right.

23:08.209 --> 23:09.025
Tell him what's
in your heart.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.234
I think you'll
find him receptive.

23:10.334 --> 23:12.899
Prue, I can't.
I need to stay here with you.

23:12.999 --> 23:14.899
Do... do you really think
he'll be receptive?

23:14.999 --> 23:19.150
Yes. Now go...
get your man.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.999
He wants you.

23:28.959 --> 23:30.067
LEO:
We'll help you out.

23:30.167 --> 23:32.609
No, no, no.
I'll hit the book alone.

23:32.709 --> 23:33.609
Your guys' couple issues

23:33.709 --> 23:34.692
are really starting
to hurt my head.

23:34.792 --> 23:37.899
Wait, we have
couple issues?

23:37.999 --> 23:40.900
Resentment. Denial. Be nice.

23:41.000 --> 23:46.401
Uh... Leo, what is it
exactly that you resent?

23:46.501 --> 23:48.109
Well, I... tried to step

23:48.209 --> 23:50.442
out into the real world today
like you wanted.

23:50.542 --> 23:51.484
Yes, and I appreciated

23:51.584 --> 23:54.692
your subtle yet effective
lunch invitation.

23:54.792 --> 23:56.609
I-I was humiliated.

23:56.709 --> 23:57.317
When?

23:57.417 --> 23:59.150
When? When the bill came.

23:59.250 --> 24:02.192
You know, Piper, in my time,
men opened doors

24:02.292 --> 24:03.150
for women
when they walked in,

24:03.250 --> 24:04.120
and they stood up
when they left

24:04.130 --> 24:06.359
and they always,
always paid for meals.

24:06.459 --> 24:09.192
I just assumed that
you were okay with it.

24:09.292 --> 24:09.776
I'm not.

24:09.876 --> 24:11.776
Well, then you should've
said something.

24:11.876 --> 24:14.859
Look, Piper, you want
me in the real world,

24:14.959 --> 24:17.401
but I'm not
of this world.

24:17.501 --> 24:19.899
I know, and I'm...
I see your point.

24:19.999 --> 24:21.942
I'm sorry
I didn't understand.

24:22.042 --> 24:25.651
I know this must be
very difficult for you.

24:25.751 --> 24:26.192
It is.

24:26.292 --> 24:27.899
Leo, you have
to understand,

24:27.999 --> 24:29.899
I am very proud
to be with you...

24:29.999 --> 24:31.899
and so proud
that I need to share you

24:31.999 --> 24:33.899
with the rest
of the world-- my world.

24:33.999 --> 24:35.983
And you know, the other stuff,
we'll just...

24:36.083 --> 24:38.959
we'll figure out.

24:44.167 --> 24:47.375
PRUE:
Not now! I have a headache!

24:55.667 --> 24:59.209
(<i>knocking at door</i>)

25:03.250 --> 25:06.109
Phoebe, what are
you doing here?

25:06.209 --> 25:07.818
I, um...

25:07.918 --> 25:11.417
I came to tell
you something.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.626
Actually...

25:21.292 --> 25:25.834
I was always much better
at show than tell.

25:32.542 --> 25:35.734
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

25:35.834 --> 25:39.292
Neither do you.

25:50.959 --> 25:52.709
(<i>kisses</i>)

25:54.417 --> 25:56.484
Morning.

25:56.584 --> 25:57.999
Morning.

26:00.209 --> 26:02.899
How are you feeling
about last night?

26:02.999 --> 26:04.025
(<i>sighs</i>)

26:04.125 --> 26:05.359
Um...

26:05.459 --> 26:09.025
Last night was...

26:09.125 --> 26:10.859
magical.

26:10.959 --> 26:12.899
And you?

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
What do you think?

26:17.292 --> 26:19.401
(<i>laughs</i>)

26:19.501 --> 26:21.025
(<i>both laugh</i>)

26:21.125 --> 26:21.899
Don't!

26:21.999 --> 26:24.899
(<i>laughing</i>):
Don't.

26:24.999 --> 26:26.900
(<i>laughs</i>)

26:27.000 --> 26:27.899
Right here.

26:27.999 --> 26:31.401
Right now, this place...

26:31.501 --> 26:33.442
it's perfect.

26:33.542 --> 26:35.150
I wish the whole
world were just

26:35.250 --> 26:37.651
right in this room.

26:37.751 --> 26:41.292
We wouldn't have to worry
about what happened next.

26:47.751 --> 26:50.818
Are you going someplace?

26:50.918 --> 26:52.899
Maybe.

26:52.999 --> 26:55.167
I'm not sure yet.

26:56.918 --> 26:58.150
You know, um...

26:58.250 --> 26:59.900
(<i>clears throat</i>)

27:00.000 --> 27:02.192
...if you're hiding
anything from me,

27:02.292 --> 27:04.776
you don't have to
hide anything from me.

27:04.876 --> 27:06.942
What makes you think
I'm hiding something?

27:07.042 --> 27:10.609
Mmm, for the same
reason I know

27:10.709 --> 27:13.250
how you really
feel about me.

27:14.584 --> 27:17.192
If you're in some
kind of trouble...

27:17.292 --> 27:17.900
I can handle it.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.417
I can help you.
No, you can't.

27:21.042 --> 27:24.000
(<i>sighs</i>)

27:27.417 --> 27:28.818
I have to go.

27:28.918 --> 27:31.083
(<i>groans</i>)

27:34.209 --> 27:37.250
Um... am I gonna see you again?

27:38.918 --> 27:42.025
One way or another.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.042
I promise.

27:56.959 --> 28:00.317
Where did Father Thomas go?

28:00.417 --> 28:01.899
Crest Hills.

28:01.999 --> 28:03.899
It's a psychiatric hospital.

28:03.999 --> 28:05.859
If I were capable of feelings,

28:05.959 --> 28:08.834
I might enjoy the irony of that.

28:10.167 --> 28:12.899
What happened
to the good Father?

28:12.999 --> 28:13.899
Pray tell.

28:13.999 --> 28:15.776
Nervous breakdown.

28:15.876 --> 28:17.484
Three years ago.

28:17.584 --> 28:19.859
Something about losing his gift

28:19.959 --> 28:20.692
to help others.

28:20.792 --> 28:22.067
Well, he might
want to worry

28:22.167 --> 28:24.109
about who's going
to help him.

28:24.209 --> 28:25.899
As should you.

28:25.999 --> 28:27.526

28:27.626 --> 28:29.484
(<i>indistinct shouting</i>)

Oh, I want a divorce!

28:30.542 --> 28:32.442

You walk in
and out of here like,

28:32.542 --> 28:33.150
like you're the one...

28:33.250 --> 28:35.275
WOMAN:
Don't turn your back on me!

28:35.375 --> 28:39.834
(<i>shouting overlaps</i>)

28:40.999 --> 28:41.899
(<i>baby crying</i>)

28:41.999 --> 28:44.109
WOMAN:
I don't love you anymore!

28:44.209 --> 28:46.109
Prue? What's the matter?

28:46.209 --> 28:47.234
What are you doing

28:47.334 --> 28:48.899
in the basement?

28:48.999 --> 28:50.899
I'm... I'm...

28:50.999 --> 28:53.334
just trying to escape.

28:54.834 --> 28:55.692
The emotions,

28:55.792 --> 28:57.067
they-they're everywhere.

28:57.167 --> 28:58.526
I can't get away....

28:58.626 --> 28:59.776
What do you mean?

28:59.876 --> 29:02.442
It's not just you and Piper.

29:02.542 --> 29:03.942
I-I'm picking up things

29:04.042 --> 29:06.192
from other people's houses.

29:06.292 --> 29:08.776
There're these people,

29:08.876 --> 29:09.899
and they're in my head,

29:09.999 --> 29:11.651
and they're in my heart,

29:11.751 --> 29:13.776
and it... it just hurts!

29:13.876 --> 29:14.484
(<i>crying</i>)

29:14.584 --> 29:16.250
No! Please.

29:17.334 --> 29:18.067
Stay away.

29:18.167 --> 29:19.818
Piper, no contact.

29:19.918 --> 29:22.417
(<i>gasping</i>)
!
Okay.

29:24.334 --> 29:25.401
God, it is just

29:25.501 --> 29:27.859
so hard to concentrate

29:27.959 --> 29:28.776
to even talk.

29:28.876 --> 29:31.150
I just want it to go away.

29:31.250 --> 29:32.275
My head,

29:32.375 --> 29:35.150
it feels like it's gonna split!

29:35.250 --> 29:35.734
(<i>crackling</i>)

29:35.834 --> 29:36.899
(<i>screaming</i>)

29:36.999 --> 29:38.818
PIPER:
Prue!

29:38.918 --> 29:40.651
What was that?

29:40.751 --> 29:41.859
LEO:
Her empathic ability.

29:41.959 --> 29:42.651
The more she feels,

29:42.751 --> 29:44.192
the more powerful
she becomes.

29:44.292 --> 29:44.899
All right.

29:44.999 --> 29:47.317
If this is a gift,
we are returning it.

29:47.417 --> 29:49.275
It was not meant for you.

29:49.375 --> 29:51.942
Come on, we're gonna
find this Vince guy.

29:52.042 --> 29:52.651
Come on.

29:52.751 --> 29:54.567
I know, I know.
You're gonna be okay.

29:54.667 --> 29:59.083
(<i>indistinct radio
transmissions )</i>

29:59.834 --> 30:00.776
Phoebe, where were you

30:00.876 --> 30:02.651
when we called?
Cole's.

30:02.751 --> 30:04.609
You could have changed.

30:04.709 --> 30:06.484
PIPER:
All night?
!
Mm-hmm.

30:06.584 --> 30:07.734
Did you...

30:07.834 --> 30:08.734
Uh-huh.

30:08.834 --> 30:09.651
Was he...

30:09.751 --> 30:10.067
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

30:10.167 --> 30:12.692
Okay, can we talk
about this later?

30:12.792 --> 30:14.317
Yeah, where's Prue?

30:14.417 --> 30:16.192
Waiting in the car.

30:16.292 --> 30:19.626
PHOEBE:
Oh, this does not look good.

30:21.334 --> 30:23.484
Cole said
that Vince never called.

30:23.584 --> 30:25.109
I'm starting to smell a demon.

30:25.209 --> 30:26.401
If you're right,
it would explain

30:26.501 --> 30:27.899
why the empathic
gift didn't kill him.

30:27.999 --> 30:30.442
I think we should stop
calling this a gift.

30:30.542 --> 30:33.651
Okay, so how did the demon
formerly known as Vince

30:33.751 --> 30:35.899
become empathic anyway?

30:35.999 --> 30:36.692
Well, I'm guessing

30:36.792 --> 30:38.275
he got the power
from a true empath.

30:38.375 --> 30:40.150
It would act like a curse
on the demon,

30:40.250 --> 30:43.209
making him feel the pain
that he inflicts.

30:49.417 --> 30:51.584
(<i>gasps</i>)

30:59.042 --> 30:59.776
Phoebe.

30:59.876 --> 31:01.776
(<i>sighs heavily</i>)
Phoebe?

31:01.876 --> 31:03.584
Okay, come on.

31:04.042 --> 31:05.609
Okay, we're definitely

31:05.709 --> 31:07.899
right about the demon theory.

31:07.999 --> 31:08.899
That was a premonition?

31:08.999 --> 31:10.899
But you-you
didn't touch anything.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.734
This room must
be dripping

31:12.834 --> 31:14.067
with psychic remnants.

31:14.167 --> 31:15.899
Well, what did you see?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.067
Uh, murders,

31:17.167 --> 31:17.899
and lots of 'em.

31:17.999 --> 31:20.899
Like a big demon killing spree.

31:20.999 --> 31:22.567
Just random?

31:22.667 --> 31:23.359
No, more like a mission.

31:23.459 --> 31:24.567
Could be he's
looking for revenge

31:24.667 --> 31:25.734
on the empath
that cursed him.

31:25.834 --> 31:26.899
PIPER:
Well, if we're

31:26.999 --> 31:28.899
gonna help Prue,
then we got to get there first.

31:28.999 --> 31:30.025
What was the last murder

31:30.125 --> 31:31.818
you saw?
A man

31:31.918 --> 31:33.609
at a mental hospital...
Crest Hills,

31:33.709 --> 31:35.734
but I don't know
if it happened already.

31:35.834 --> 31:38.918
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

31:39.250 --> 31:42.609
(<i>indistinct shouting</i>)

31:42.709 --> 31:46.375
(<i>breathing heavily</i>)

31:50.292 --> 31:52.899
And who are you here
to visit today?

31:52.999 --> 31:56.317
Um, we came to
visit our father.

31:56.417 --> 31:58.167
What's his name?

31:59.042 --> 31:59.818
Dad?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.192
This is a
psychiatric facility.

32:02.292 --> 32:03.899
We can't very well

32:03.999 --> 32:05.899
let every...
Okay.

32:05.999 --> 32:07.526
This place
is a minefield for you,

32:07.626 --> 32:08.567
you should wait here.

32:08.667 --> 32:09.401
No, if Vince comes,

32:09.501 --> 32:12.999
I need to be there
to reverse the spell.

32:15.999 --> 32:18.818
That looks like the guy
from my premonition.

32:18.918 --> 32:20.484
(<i>TV playing</i>)

32:20.584 --> 32:23.417
(<i>man grunts</i>)

32:26.042 --> 32:28.626
Hi. Excuse me.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.899
Um, I know this is probably

32:30.999 --> 32:32.899
gonna sound crazy, but...

32:32.999 --> 32:35.442
are you am empath?

32:35.542 --> 32:38.983
You people don't
have to humor me, you know.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.899
I know you don't believe me.

32:40.999 --> 32:42.859
No, uh, we're
not doctors

32:42.959 --> 32:43.734
or patients.

32:43.834 --> 32:46.317
We're... we're witches,

32:46.417 --> 32:48.359
and we're looking
for the empath

32:48.459 --> 32:50.501
who cursed a demon.

32:54.250 --> 32:57.067
I was working as a priest,

32:57.167 --> 32:59.899
helping people,
when it came after me.

32:59.999 --> 33:00.859
You mean Vince?

33:00.959 --> 33:03.125
Is that what it calls itself?

33:06.292 --> 33:07.025
Vinceres

33:07.125 --> 33:09.067
is a demonic assassin.

33:09.167 --> 33:10.651
Timeless.

33:10.751 --> 33:11.401
Unstoppable.

33:11.501 --> 33:13.025
But you stopped him. How?

33:13.125 --> 33:14.025
When the demon

33:14.125 --> 33:15.484
took my throat to kill me,

33:15.584 --> 33:16.899
I laid my hands on him,

33:16.999 --> 33:18.275
as if to heal him.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.651
And you gave him your power.
Yes.

33:20.751 --> 33:22.275
I didn't know if
I could, but I did.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.609
I cursed Vinceres and myself.

33:24.709 --> 33:26.542
How did you curse yourself?

33:27.959 --> 33:30.109
I'm staring at eternity
on Earth,

33:30.209 --> 33:32.692
with no gift
and no reason to be.

33:32.792 --> 33:35.776
Well, I can't help you
with the eternity part,

33:35.876 --> 33:37.692
but I <i>can</i> give you
a reason to be now.

33:37.792 --> 33:39.899
Yeah, I know, I know,
I read the paper.

33:39.999 --> 33:41.899
We have to get to that building

33:41.999 --> 33:43.609
and safely relocate the demon.

33:43.709 --> 33:45.651
Uh, it's funny you should
mention that,

33:45.751 --> 33:47.401
because when Prue
met Vinceres,

33:47.501 --> 33:48.899
she thought that
he was a shut-in,

33:48.999 --> 33:50.899
and....
!
You didn't cast a spell?!

33:50.999 --> 33:51.734
She, did but...

33:51.834 --> 33:53.275
I gave up everything

33:53.375 --> 33:54.692
to prevent that beast

33:54.792 --> 33:55.899
from killing again!

33:55.999 --> 33:56.899
If it's free,

33:56.999 --> 33:57.983
you can't stop it!

33:58.083 --> 33:58.818
Nobody can!

33:58.918 --> 34:00.401
(<i>rumbling</i>)
!
Stop yelling.

34:00.501 --> 34:01.275
(<i>glass breaking</i>)

34:01.375 --> 34:03.442
Please! I can't take it!

34:03.542 --> 34:04.999
(<i>gasping</i>)

34:06.834 --> 34:07.899
In the walls!

34:07.999 --> 34:09.375
Can't you hear it?

34:10.998 --> 34:13.751
(<i>people yelling</i>)

34:16.042 --> 34:18.125
(<i>glass breaking</i>)

34:22.998 --> 34:25.000
(<i>sobs</i>)

34:26.792 --> 34:29.192
(<i>Prue shivering</i>)

34:29.292 --> 34:32.234
(<i>shivering, gasping</i>)

34:32.333 --> 34:34.998
(<i>overlapping voices</i>)

34:37.998 --> 34:42.292
(<i>overlapping voices</i>)

34:43.792 --> 34:45.650
PIPER:
Here he is, Vinceres.

34:45.751 --> 34:46.650
(<i>chuckles</i>)

34:46.751 --> 34:49.109
Pretty much lives up
to his gloss.

34:49.208 --> 34:50.192
Unstoppable hit-man,

34:50.292 --> 34:53.899
just keeps going
till he gets his target.

34:53.998 --> 34:56.899
Great, the Energizer Demon.

34:56.998 --> 34:58.899
So what do we do?

34:58.999 --> 34:59.651
There's nothing.

34:59.751 --> 35:01.609
There's nothing
you <i>can</i> do.

35:01.709 --> 35:02.317
It will find us,

35:02.417 --> 35:03.567
and when it does,
we're all dead.

35:03.667 --> 35:05.192
Well, you're just
a ray of sunshine,

35:05.292 --> 35:06.692
now, aren't you?

35:06.792 --> 35:08.234
(<i>footsteps</i>)

35:08.334 --> 35:09.651
PIPER:
Hey.

35:09.751 --> 35:10.899
Anything?
LEO:
No.

35:10.999 --> 35:11.899
She won't say a word.

35:11.999 --> 35:12.818
We've got to snap Prue

35:12.918 --> 35:14.317
out of this
or else she won't be able

35:14.417 --> 35:15.234
to reverse the spell

35:15.334 --> 35:16.234
when the demon attacks.

35:16.334 --> 35:17.442
You can't reverse the spell.

35:17.542 --> 35:19.859
Vinceres is immune
to witches' magic.

35:19.959 --> 35:20.692
Hold on.

35:20.792 --> 35:21.692
Prue's spell worked.

35:21.792 --> 35:23.025
That's because the demon
allowed it to work,

35:23.125 --> 35:23.983
to its own advantage.

35:24.083 --> 35:25.401
You'll find your spells

35:25.501 --> 35:26.983
useless now.
Maybe we actually

35:27.083 --> 35:28.609
don't need to reverse the spell.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.317
What are you thinking?
Well, Prue's
getting hit

35:30.417 --> 35:32.899
by emotions, all emotions.

35:32.999 --> 35:35.818
And her powers are
tied to these emotions.

35:35.918 --> 35:37.899
So maybe if she
could figure out a way

35:37.999 --> 35:38.496
to channel them,

35:38.506 --> 35:40.859
then she'd be
pretty unstoppable herself,

35:40.959 --> 35:41.899
don't you think?
!
Is that possible?

35:41.999 --> 35:44.192
THOMAS:
From what I've seen,
your sister is too far gone,

35:44.292 --> 35:45.899
she won't live to see the night.

35:45.999 --> 35:47.818
All right, that's it!
LEO:
Piper...

35:47.918 --> 35:48.651
No, I'm sorry,

35:48.751 --> 35:49.899
but this man has experienced

35:49.999 --> 35:50.899
the entire rainbow

35:50.999 --> 35:51.579
of human emotions,

35:51.589 --> 35:54.150
and the best he has to give us
here is self-pity?

35:54.250 --> 35:54.899
I don't think so.

35:54.999 --> 35:57.401
Look, you used this power
to stop this demon.

35:57.501 --> 35:58.734
Now my sister
has your power.

35:58.834 --> 36:02.292
Deal with it,
and then help us.

36:03.709 --> 36:07.651
(<i>crying</i>)

36:07.751 --> 36:08.899
Go away!

36:08.999 --> 36:10.334
(<i>weeping</i>)

36:11.459 --> 36:12.359
I know how you feel.

36:12.459 --> 36:14.899
Your instinct
is to pull away.

36:14.999 --> 36:15.567
Don't.

36:15.667 --> 36:17.442
Try to find
an inner calm.

36:17.542 --> 36:18.317
I can't!

36:18.417 --> 36:20.900
The pain, the noise.
You're carrying

36:21.000 --> 36:23.899
a cross you were never
meant to bear, I'm sorry.

36:23.999 --> 36:25.899
Your sorrow, I can't,

36:25.999 --> 36:26.899
I can't take it!

36:26.999 --> 36:28.899
Please.
You've been fighting
what you feel.

36:28.999 --> 36:31.359
That's natural, and it's wrong.

36:31.459 --> 36:32.942
To find your strength
as an empath,

36:33.042 --> 36:35.542
you must embrace the emotion.

36:36.209 --> 36:36.899
Focus on me.

36:36.999 --> 36:38.192
The feelings are
ripping you apart,

36:38.292 --> 36:39.484
because you're fighting them,

36:39.584 --> 36:40.734
like the demon did.

36:40.834 --> 36:41.859
A demon can't handle

36:41.959 --> 36:44.000
human emotions, you can.

36:47.999 --> 36:49.526
Anybody home?

36:49.626 --> 36:50.626
Piper, now!

36:53.584 --> 36:55.692
Okay, I guess
this is the unstoppable part!

36:55.792 --> 36:56.899
(<i>grunts</i>)

36:56.999 --> 36:59.792
Where's Father Thomas?
Plan B, plan B!

37:02.918 --> 37:04.459
(<i>screams</i>)

37:10.584 --> 37:13.751
(<i>both grunting</i>)

37:16.959 --> 37:18.899
Whoo!
!
(<i>screams</i>)

37:18.999 --> 37:20.859
PHOEBE:
Okay.

37:20.959 --> 37:22.734
Do we have a plan C?

37:22.834 --> 37:23.859
PIPER:
Uh...

37:23.959 --> 37:24.751
Whoa!

37:26.417 --> 37:27.692
Leo, hurry!

37:27.792 --> 37:28.192
THOMAS:
Prue.

37:28.292 --> 37:31.834
(<i>weeping</i>)
!
Take my hand.

37:36.626 --> 37:38.899
My power to ease
human suffering

37:38.999 --> 37:39.899
lay in my hands.

37:39.999 --> 37:41.025
That's how I cursed the demon.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.899
You must channel
the empathic gift

37:43.999 --> 37:45.401
into your power.

37:45.501 --> 37:47.025
I can't.

37:47.125 --> 37:48.067
I can't

37:48.167 --> 37:49.899
control my power.

37:49.999 --> 37:51.109
FATHER THOMAS:
Prue, you can do it.

37:51.209 --> 37:53.275
You have a once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity

37:53.375 --> 37:55.317
to feel the world's emotions,

37:55.417 --> 37:57.484
all it means to be human,

37:57.584 --> 37:58.900
the good and the bad.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.584
Don't be afraid.

38:02.334 --> 38:04.859
(<i>choking</i>)
Just tell me
where the empath is,

38:04.959 --> 38:06.609
and I won't kill you.
(<i>footsteps</i>)

38:06.709 --> 38:08.709
PRUE:
You want him?

38:10.999 --> 38:13.667
Come and get him.

38:16.209 --> 38:19.626
(<i>grunting</i>)

38:20.626 --> 38:22.067
How'd you do that?

38:22.167 --> 38:22.900
If you want the empath,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.125
you're gonna
have to go through me.

38:28.167 --> 38:28.983
Stay back.

38:29.083 --> 38:31.125
This is my fight.

38:31.501 --> 38:35.042
(<i>Vinceres, Prue grunting</i>)

38:50.250 --> 38:51.983
(<i>snickering</i>)

38:52.083 --> 38:53.526
You can't hurt me, witch.

38:53.626 --> 38:57.125
I can handle your powers.

39:24.834 --> 39:26.209
(<i>grunts</i>)

39:31.959 --> 39:34.899
I can handle your powers.

39:34.999 --> 39:35.899
What about pain?

39:35.999 --> 39:37.584
Human pain?

39:45.999 --> 39:49.025
(<i>Vinceres screaming</i>)

39:49.125 --> 39:53.792
(<i>continues screaming</i>)

40:13.751 --> 40:15.999
The voices, they're gone.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.651
So you're not an
empath anymore.

40:22.751 --> 40:23.999
I'm sorry.

40:24.542 --> 40:26.776
I was hoping
that we could return your gift.

40:26.876 --> 40:27.275
But you did.

40:27.375 --> 40:28.275
(<i>chuckles</i>)
It appears I have

40:28.375 --> 40:31.484
the ability to understand
what people are feeling

40:31.584 --> 40:33.275
even without a magic assist.

40:33.375 --> 40:35.025
(<i>chuckles</i>)

40:35.125 --> 40:36.899
You kicked ass.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.818
I did, didn't I?

40:38.918 --> 40:41.234
(<i>crowd murmuring</i>)

40:41.334 --> 40:45.999
(<i>playing and singing
 mid-tempo rock tune</i>)

41:02.834 --> 41:04.983
Hey.
Hey.

41:05.083 --> 41:05.900
You know, I cannot wait

41:06.000 --> 41:07.692
for this Novocain to wear off.

41:07.792 --> 41:08.359
Can you...

41:08.459 --> 41:09.150
(<i>fades into mumbling</i>)

41:09.250 --> 41:11.567
You're lucky that
dentist even saw you.

41:11.667 --> 41:13.150
Okay, there's one thing

41:13.250 --> 41:14.900
I don't get.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.234
How did you vanquish Vinceres?

41:16.334 --> 41:18.899
Well, it was something
that Father Thomas said to me.

41:18.999 --> 41:19.899
Vinceres was trying

41:19.999 --> 41:22.899
to fight off the feelings
of an empath, because demons

41:22.999 --> 41:24.275
cannot handle human emotion.

41:24.375 --> 41:26.401
And so you astral-projected

41:26.501 --> 41:27.025
into his body?

41:27.125 --> 41:29.651
Yes,
carrying the emotional baggage

41:29.751 --> 41:30.899
of half of the city.

41:30.999 --> 41:32.025
I forced him to feel,

41:32.125 --> 41:33.609
and he couldn't take it.

41:33.709 --> 41:34.609
LEO:
Hey.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.899
Hey.
Just left
Father Thomas.

41:36.999 --> 41:38.109
I got connections
at the archdiocese.

41:38.209 --> 41:40.484
They're gonna let him
return to his church.

41:40.584 --> 41:41.484
Thank you.

41:41.584 --> 41:42.234
You're an angel.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.609
Well, not technically.

41:44.709 --> 41:45.818
PRUE:
Eww.

41:45.918 --> 41:46.734
(<i>Phoebe chuckles</i>)

41:46.834 --> 41:48.401
So I guess the only
other question is:

41:48.501 --> 41:50.692
Who sent the signs
that led Prue to the demon?

41:50.792 --> 41:53.526
Well, probably the Triad...
or Belthazor,

41:53.626 --> 41:54.692
which means we
have to be careful

41:54.792 --> 41:55.900
the next time
we get a sign.

41:56.000 --> 41:56.776
Yeah, but, Prue,

41:56.876 --> 41:58.776
you got
quite a power boost there.

41:58.876 --> 42:00.317
Are you gonna miss it?

42:00.417 --> 42:00.983
Yeah.

42:01.083 --> 42:04.275
But I did get to stop
an unstoppable demon.

42:04.375 --> 42:05.567
Got a little taste
of what my

42:05.667 --> 42:06.983
future powers
are gonna be like,

42:07.083 --> 42:08.150
I'm on the right path.

42:08.250 --> 42:10.900
Oh, speaking of paths,

42:11.000 --> 42:12.859
what's up with you

42:12.959 --> 42:13.899
and your Cole dependency?

42:13.999 --> 42:15.234
Where do you guys stand?
Oh...

42:15.334 --> 42:16.999
I have no idea.

42:18.292 --> 42:21.709
I think I'm gonna
go find out right now.

42:22.667 --> 42:23.999
Yeah.

42:28.083 --> 42:29.067
Hi.

42:29.167 --> 42:30.751
Hi.

42:31.459 --> 42:33.899
I half-expected
not to find you here.

42:33.999 --> 42:35.334
Yeah?

42:35.959 --> 42:37.899
Well, an associate of mine

42:37.999 --> 42:40.651
didn't do as he was told, so...

42:40.751 --> 42:43.876
I've still got work to do here.

42:45.375 --> 42:47.651
Is that a good thing

42:47.751 --> 42:49.792
or a bad thing?

42:51.542 --> 42:53.792
Both.

42:58.999 --> 43:01.209
(<i>kisses</i>)
