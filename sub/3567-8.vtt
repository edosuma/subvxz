00:17.950 --> 00:20.667
Pay attention, Steven.
This is going to be your first

00:20.669 --> 00:25.388
- serious mission. You need to be ready.
- Yes. I'm ready.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.634
- I'm so ready!
- Steven, come on.

00:27.710 --> 00:30.644
You're going to make yourself sick.

00:30.646 --> 00:33.488
- Why did you bring that?
- I don't know. I was excited

00:33.562 --> 00:38.885
- and it's mine and I like it. Wha...
- Steven, get back here!

00:38.887 --> 00:41.144
You could get seriously...

00:41.577 --> 00:44.691
<i>hurt.</i>

00:48.580 --> 00:52.165
- Steven, are you ...
- I'm fine. I'm good.

00:52.167 --> 00:55.618
I'm just gooey. Mmm.

00:55.620 --> 01:01.775
Aah, they're in my eyes!

01:06.466 --> 01:09.158
They're just
butterflies, Steven.

01:09.159 --> 01:11.851
Well, they looked a lot bigger

01:11.853 --> 01:16.773
- when they were on my eyeballs.
- Steven, you're a riot.

01:16.775 --> 01:19.189
I'm suddenly having second
thoughts about bringing

01:19.275 --> 01:25.198
-  Steven on this one.
- Shh. Just look at him.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.940
Now, let's go recover the gemstone.

01:27.419 --> 01:31.071
Unbelievable. This
was once a gem battlefield.

01:31.073 --> 01:36.710
Now it's wild strawberries as far as the
eye can see. Oh, that's what I love

01:36.712 --> 01:39.379
about the Earth. Maybe this will
be a light mission after all.

01:39.381 --> 01:42.182
Oh!

01:42.184 --> 01:46.355
Maybe not.

01:51.954 --> 01:58.819
Whoa!
Whoa!

01:59.801 --> 02:03.837
Steven's the best!
Steven's the best!

02:03.838 --> 02:08.619
- Why, thank you, temple.
- You're a doof.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.946
Hey. What's this thing?

02:12.948 --> 02:16.983
- It's like a cool floaty triangle thing.
- W-whatever it is,

02:16.985 --> 02:19.716
you probably shouldn't touch it.

02:19.991 --> 02:24.416
Steven!
What have we told you

02:24.451 --> 02:29.774
- about touching magical things?
- Definitely always... never do it.

02:32.411 --> 02:34.551
Whoa!

02:42.042 --> 02:45.005
Looks like we're gonna have to split up.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.218
Right. Steven
and I will stay right

02:47.359 --> 02:51.222
here where it seems to
be safe while you guys go

02:51.268 --> 02:54.487
- and solve the mystery of this place.
- Wait. I want to help

02:54.489 --> 02:56.890
- solve the mystery.
- Yeah. Come on, Steven.

02:56.892 --> 03:00.293
- Let's solve the mystery.
- Yeah! Mystery solvers!

03:00.295 --> 03:02.312
Nope.
No, no, no, no, no.

03:02.313 --> 03:05.346
You two are a disaster
waiting to happen.

03:05.381 --> 03:09.084
- Steven goes with me.
- Really? Awesome!

03:09.119 --> 03:12.906
But remember ...
this is a serious mission.

03:12.908 --> 03:18.011
Understood. Serious Steven...
Pearl, can you put me down?

03:18.013 --> 03:20.380
- What? Oh, yes. Of course.
- I need to be standing,

03:20.382 --> 03:24.861
or else it doesn't work.
Serious Steven... activate!

03:26.855 --> 03:31.737
- But this could be the teacups all over again.
- Hey! I've put that behind me.

04:21.586 --> 04:25.746
Steven!

04:30.084 --> 04:33.065
Whoo-hoo!
That was...

04:33.873 --> 04:37.840
uh, seriously dangerous.
Thank you, Garnet.

04:50.955 --> 04:52.972
We can take
a break if you're not

04:52.974 --> 04:55.825
- feeling well, Steven.
- Huh? Oh, no.

04:55.827 --> 05:00.780
- I-I'm okay. Let's keep going.
- All right, but be careful.

05:00.782 --> 05:04.250
You might trigger
a trap with that gun show.

05:04.252 --> 05:11.040
Right. I'll put these
babies away and use my minds.

05:11.042 --> 05:15.878
Maybe there's a clue hidden in these
ancient drawings. It looks like...

05:15.880 --> 05:21.634
there's lots of triangles hidden
somewhere in this room.

05:21.636 --> 05:25.698
Run!

05:30.678 --> 05:35.398
- Oh, my ukulele!
- Steven!

05:35.400 --> 05:39.185
Now is probably not the best
time for that.

05:39.187 --> 05:42.767
Oh. Uh ... uh, right.

05:45.311 --> 05:51.250
- Now, that was a pretty close one.
- Yeah.

05:51.633 --> 05:58.094
That was a pretty... close... one.
Uh...

06:06.828 --> 06:09.548
Get ready, Steven.
This is gonna be intense.

06:12.185 --> 06:17.723
- Get ready, Steven. This is gonna be intense.
- I'm ready!

06:23.439 --> 06:29.047
I misunderstood the point of this ride.

06:29.751 --> 06:34.457
- This is fun, Steven.
- I think...

06:34.543 --> 06:41.003
- I need to get off this ride now.
- Steven, no!

06:51.492 --> 06:56.145
Steven, you are
banned from all the rides forever!

07:03.352 --> 07:07.273
- Whoa. We made it?
- I carried you while

07:07.275 --> 07:11.911
- you took a nap.
- B-but... nap?!

07:16.662 --> 07:20.453
- We're back where we started.
- What?!

07:20.455 --> 07:25.258
<i>Garnet, there you are!
The doors and rooms here make no sense.</i>

07:25.260 --> 07:28.011
They all bring you back here.

07:30.765 --> 07:35.968
- Get me out of here!
- There are 16 doors, and we entered from

07:35.970 --> 07:39.655
the Northeast and went through three
consecutive rooms in a straight line...

07:39.657 --> 07:45.361
- Ow!
- ...but arrived back here out

07:45.363 --> 07:48.745
the Southernmost door,
which can only mean ...

07:48.746 --> 07:53.762
w-well, I don't know what it means. I ...

07:53.797 --> 07:58.624
- this is a death trap!
- What ... what do we do?

07:58.626 --> 08:02.379
We go back in again

08:02.380 --> 08:06.132
<i>and again... and again...
and again.</i>

08:06.134 --> 08:07.701
I can't!

08:07.702 --> 08:10.836
- Steven.
- It's okay.

08:10.838 --> 08:15.358
No. No, it's not.
You were all right about me.

08:15.360 --> 08:20.179
I wanted to do this so bad, but
now I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

08:20.181 --> 08:25.401
- This is just like the teacups!
- Oh, Steven. I didn't really mean that.

08:25.403 --> 08:27.971
Wait!
Ah! Wait, you guys!

08:27.972 --> 08:32.958
What if this is just like the teacups?
That's why we're getting so lost.

08:32.961 --> 08:35.409
That's why I'm feeling so sick.

08:35.409 --> 08:39.081
All the rooms are spinning
us around so we end up here.

08:55.724 --> 08:59.529
Whoa!

09:02.574 --> 09:04.950
This is unbelievable.

09:05.285 --> 09:09.322
This gem-powered mechanism ...
it's manipulating the rooms above.

09:09.357 --> 09:12.365
<i>Every room we entered
spun us until we came back</i>

09:12.367 --> 09:16.569
to the central chamber. It's just
like the teacup ride at funland.

09:16.571 --> 09:20.289
- Steven already figured that out.
- Oh.

09:23.645 --> 09:26.762
Garnet, I need to get off the ride now.

09:29.646 --> 09:34.153
Serious Steven... go!

09:34.695 --> 09:36.436
Whoa!

09:39.811 --> 09:41.741
Huh?

09:43.537 --> 09:47.533
- Ah!
- Huh?

10:08.060 --> 10:11.340
Steven? Steven!
Where is he?

10:11.342 --> 10:17.963
- Oh, he's over here.
- The gem.

10:17.965 --> 10:21.601
- I'd say you handled that adventure very well.
- Yeah.

10:21.603 --> 10:28.074
