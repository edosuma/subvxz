00:36.960 --> 00:38.200
I wasn't expecting this.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.440
Is that a yes?

00:45.280 --> 00:46.600
Is that a yes?

00:51.120 --> 00:52.120
[softly] Yes.

Yes.

-[Carlota] Miguel.
-Carlota, what are you doing here?

02:20.160 --> 02:23.240
You're a rat! Or worse.
At least rats look after their own.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.160
-What's this about? Do you know?
-You're a hypocrite!

02:26.240 --> 02:27.760
I know about the rotary!

02:27.840 --> 02:29.600
Why didn't you tell me
what that thing was?

02:29.680 --> 02:32.520
-I told you a thousand times.
-You know what I mean.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.760
How could you build a machine
that will take all our jobs?

02:35.840 --> 02:39.360
Where are your principles?
Or was it all just talk?

02:39.440 --> 02:41.360
Of course it wasn't, but I'm an engineer.

CHAPTER 8: LOVE

02:42.480 --> 02:44.240
I make things that improve people's lives.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.800
I'm delighted for you.
Congratulations, you've succeeded.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.880
Now we'll all lose our jobs.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.760
I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.800
-Now that Lidia has told you, I'm sorry.
-Excuse me?

02:56.880 --> 03:00.240
-What does Lidia have to do with this?
-[Marga] It was Pablo who told us.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.120
If Lidia knew,
why didn't she say something?

03:04.200 --> 03:05.640
Don Carlos told her, didn't he?

03:06.480 --> 03:07.960
She wants to be one of them.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.680
She accompanied Don Carlos
to Don Ricardo's funeral.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.440
They're dating.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.200
It's clear which side she's on.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.320
Lidia Aguilar is my fiancée! My fiancée!
[laughing]

03:23.400 --> 03:26.320
Be quiet!
Carlos, you'll wake everybody up.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.840
They should wake up. I don't know
why they're sleeping on a night like this.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.920
-Let's practice our wedding dance.
-[laughing]

03:33.000 --> 03:35.800
Great! You're ready to skip ahead
to the wedding night.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.440
-You need to take a cold shower.
-[growls]

03:38.520 --> 03:40.200
It will all have been worthwhile.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.120
Let's toast with your friends
and Doña Lola.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.160
-A man in the boardinghouse? You're crazy.
-Not just any man, your fiancé.

03:45.240 --> 03:49.680
That's even worse.
We'll tell everyone tomorrow.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.640
-Are you happy?
-Very.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.200
See you tomorrow.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.160
See you tomorrow.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.360
[Francisco] Alba.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.000
I suppose I should congratulate you
on your engagement.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.720
And I have to thank you for the photos.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.720
How did you get them?

04:40.200 --> 04:41.720
Beltrán is dead.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.640
I went to his house to get the photos.
I found him lying on the floor.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.920
The house was ransacked,
but these were still there.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.760
That bastard won't bother you again.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.400
I can't believe it.

04:57.480 --> 05:00.360
You're free.
That's why I went to the station.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.680
I thought you were going to tell Carlos.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.840
I was going to stop you,
but it wasn't necessary.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.400
I'm sorry you saw something that...

05:09.320 --> 05:10.400
Alba...

05:12.240 --> 05:13.920
Carlos deserves to be happy...

05:16.000 --> 05:17.160
and so do you.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.400
What about you?

05:24.720 --> 05:28.000
You never have
to worry about me again, Lidia.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.840
Although, to me, you will always be Alba.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.080
[sighs deeply]

06:01.720 --> 06:03.000
You're late.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.440
It's only 12:30, Marga.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.720
[scoffs]

06:11.800 --> 06:14.000
Well, later than usual.
Later than you should be.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.200
Doña Lola wouldn't like it.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.160
Carlota, I didn't know you were coming.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.800
Were you with Don Carlos?
You look like you're on cloud nine.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.400
Well, it seems that things
are starting to work out. [chuckles]

06:28.480 --> 06:29.920
Did he ask you to marry him?

06:31.160 --> 06:34.320
If you had any faith left in her,
this proves she can't be trusted.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.800
She's joined the enemy.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.800
Did you know about that machine?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.040
The one that your boyfriend
made Miguel build.

06:41.120 --> 06:44.920
Lidia, we're your friends.
Why didn't you tell us?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.760
-We'll be laid off.
-[Alba] No, you won't lose your jobs.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.000
Carlos destroyed the rotary.
I don't think he wants it to move forward.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.360
[Carlota] You don't? Well, I do.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.400
Because they're rebuilding it

06:55.480 --> 06:57.800
and Miguel says it'll be working in a day.
Come on.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.000
Girls...

06:59.480 --> 07:03.480
if you want,
I can talk to Carlos and try to fix this.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.720
Give me a chance, please.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.800
-Good evening.
-My dear, I'm glad you're here.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.160
I've just spoken to Doña Alicia
to confirm your meeting.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.520
-[Carlos] Wonderful, thank you, Mother.
-Who's Alicia?

07:22.600 --> 07:25.360
[Carmen] Mr. Uribe's secretary.
He's just arrived from Colombia.

07:25.440 --> 07:30.400
He wants to invest in the company
and go ahead with Carlos' project.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.080
Is that champagne?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.800
I think it's a bit soon for that, my dear.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.680
-I proposed to Lidia.
-Really?

07:40.880 --> 07:42.640
[laughing]

07:45.160 --> 07:46.960
Congratulations!

07:48.000 --> 07:49.560
She said yes, didn't she?

07:49.640 --> 07:53.320
It's one thing to count your chickens,
and another to be a total idiot.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.440
You think I'd have bought champagne
if she hadn't?

07:58.400 --> 08:00.720
Mother, don't rush to congratulate me.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.840
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.920
[Elisa] Don't be such a wet blanket!

08:08.000 --> 08:11.280
All the fights I had with Father
made me wake up and sort myself out.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.720
That's what I'm doing.
You were right. This is my moment.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.600
Any champagne left
for a toast with a friend?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.240
[chuckles] That's what I thought.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.120
Elisa told me.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.800
[chuckles]

08:47.880 --> 08:49.960
And did she tell you
how my mother took it?

08:50.040 --> 08:51.800
[laughs] Yes.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.840
Why can't she be happy for me?

08:57.040 --> 08:57.920
[cork pops]

08:58.880 --> 09:00.760
Because then she wouldn't be your mother.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.040
She always has to think the worst.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.280
She'll end up accepting her,
like she accepted me.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.560
If she treats Lidia
like she treated you...

09:10.000 --> 09:12.720
I think your mother
has found a worthy opponent.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.920
To you, my friend.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.960
To you and your happiness.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.320
[Alba] <i>Only a good friend</i>

09:26.400 --> 09:29.160
<i>is capable of sacrificing</i>
<i>his own happiness for a friend's.</i>

09:32.280 --> 09:33.880
<i>Friendship or love.</i>

09:35.560 --> 09:37.240
<i>What a difficult decision.</i>

09:51.280 --> 09:52.600
Lidia, my dear.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.360
You weren't expecting me, were you?

09:55.440 --> 09:57.720
Doña Carmen, what a surprise.

09:57.800 --> 10:01.640
I've come to congratulate you
on your engagement.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.680
-It was a surprise for everyone.
-[chuckles]

10:04.760 --> 10:10.560
My son usually asks me for advice
when he has to make an important decision.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.920
It's obvious he didn't think
this one was so important.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.960
Or perhaps he didn't need
your good advice.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.240
-I suppose this has taken you by surprise.
-Mm.

10:21.320 --> 10:26.240
Indeed. And you know that haste
is the devil's work.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.400
But anyway, first things first.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.200
Won't you give
your future mother-in-law a kiss?

10:34.280 --> 10:38.960
[whispering] I won't let a gold digger
like you take the Cifuentes name.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.400
I'm giving you a chance
to break off the engagement immediately

10:42.480 --> 10:44.880
and spare yourself a lot of suffering.

10:47.720 --> 10:52.760
Ah, my son is upstairs
seeing to some important work matters,

10:52.840 --> 10:54.760
but he'll be down soon, my dear.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.480
We'll be in touch for the next few hours.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.840
Tomorrow, I plan to present the rotary
to the press.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.080
Then I'll try to postpone my trip
so I can attend.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.840
-Don Carlos, thank you for everything.
-Thank you.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.960
-Do you have a minute?
-Just one? For you, I have a million.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.800
Are you installing the rotary here?

11:22.360 --> 11:23.760
I see good news travels fast.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.240
I thought you destroyed it
after your father died.

11:28.320 --> 11:32.320
My father trusted me to run the company,
and now I can do things the way I want to.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.080
Is that what he wanted?

11:37.360 --> 11:40.560
All the employees depend on you now.
You have to be sensible.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.760
So you agree with Francisco now?

11:43.360 --> 11:45.320
You're starting to sound a lot like him.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.560
Maybe because he's right.

11:48.640 --> 11:53.160
Perhaps installing the rotary now
isn't the best idea.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.680
-Your father--
-He saw things differently.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.560
The rotary is the future.
I'll prove him wrong.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.840
Weren't we partners?

12:03.440 --> 12:05.640
You were the first
to support me with the rotary,

12:05.720 --> 12:08.560
and now that we're so close,
you're backing out. I don't understand.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.720
What's going on?

12:09.800 --> 12:13.400
-Why did you change your mind?
-I hadn't thought of the consequences.

12:15.800 --> 12:20.160
It'll mean the end of the operators,
of my friends and their jobs...

12:20.920 --> 12:24.120
-Right now, they think I'm a traitor.
-[sighs]

12:24.200 --> 12:28.240
Carlos, if you knew them,
their lives, their problems...

12:28.320 --> 12:30.040
They can't lose their jobs.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.280
It's everything to them.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.440
I know it's asking a lot.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.280
Do you love me?

12:39.360 --> 12:41.480
-Lidia...
-Do you love me?

12:42.240 --> 12:43.520
Do it for me?

12:45.040 --> 12:46.480
Forget the rotary...

12:48.360 --> 12:50.080
and we'll go on without it.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.000
I'd do anything for you.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.080
I'd set aside all my dreams.
You're what's most important to me.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.360
But I can't do what you're asking.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.920
Lidia, I can't do it.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.560
That man who just left

13:04.640 --> 13:07.120
is the lawyer for the company's
new partners, the Uribes.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.040
I've just signed an agreement
to go ahead with the rotary.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.160
If I don't do it,
they'll take over the company.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.720
-Lidia, I'd lose everything.
-[sighs]

13:20.360 --> 13:21.880
My hands are tied.

14:24.680 --> 14:25.840
Shit!

14:30.800 --> 14:31.960
[grunts]

14:36.320 --> 14:39.440
Is it true?
Are they installing that contraption here?

14:39.520 --> 14:42.200
That machine will be
up and running very soon.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.280
And when that happens,
you'll all be fired.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.880
-Let's hope Lidia can do something.
-Yeah.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.160
Here she is.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.720
I've spoken to Carlos.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.120
-He can't do anything.
-What? No.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.760
He'll try to ensure
you don't lose your jobs.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.400
He'll find alternatives,
jobs in other cities...

15:03.480 --> 15:06.640
No, I can't leave Madrid.
What about my daughter?

15:06.720 --> 15:09.480
Pablo and I have been through so much.
I'm not leaving.

15:09.560 --> 15:13.720
Relocation is a temporary solution.
The rotary will kill our profession.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.360
I'm very sorry, really.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.120
Carlos has important reasons
for carrying on with--

15:19.200 --> 15:21.000
Forget it! You've chosen your side.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.120
You've given up being an operator
to become a Cifuentes.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.320
I hope it's worth it.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.560
-It's not like that.
-Yes, it is like that!

15:28.920 --> 15:30.200
[Sara] Carlota!

15:35.360 --> 15:36.400
We have to talk.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.640
-This isn't a good time.
-It's important. Follow me.

15:46.880 --> 15:47.920
[sighs heavily]

15:48.000 --> 15:51.280
I can't find my cigarette case.
I've looked everywhere.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.400
-I think I lost it at Beltrán's house.
-What?

15:53.480 --> 15:56.920
Maybe I dropped it there.
It all happened so quickly.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.760
I know I had it in the car
before I went in.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.640
I searched the car, and it isn't there.

16:01.720 --> 16:06.440
Calm down.
A cigarette case can't lead them to you.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.400
My name's engraved on it.

16:14.960 --> 16:15.920
Shit.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.480
Beltrán is dead?

16:18.560 --> 16:21.800
Well, at last,
a bit of good luck, my dear.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.840
How did you find out?

16:24.120 --> 16:28.840
[Alba] <i>Francisco found him in his house.</i>
<i>He got the photos back.</i>

16:28.920 --> 16:32.240
I'm glad this nightmare is over.
You can relax now.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.360
<i>Not yet.</i>

16:34.440 --> 16:36.920
He thinks he left
his cigarette case there.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.880
It's got his name on it.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.200
<i>I need you to use your contacts</i>
<i>to find out if the police found it.</i>

16:45.800 --> 16:47.600
I'll do what I can, princess.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.360
Thank you.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.720
Can we trust her?

16:54.800 --> 16:56.800
If the police have found it, she'll know.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.320
[sighs] How can I explain why I was there?

17:00.400 --> 17:03.240
A cigarette case
doesn't prove that you killed him.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.119
It's got my name on it.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.119
-We'll come up with an alibi.
-Like what?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.240
Calm down.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.920
It's too soon to talk about that.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.560
We'll act like nothing's happened.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.680
-Look at me!
-[inhales deeply]

17:19.680 --> 17:21.599
As far as we know, Beltrán is alive.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.119
[Carlos] <i>Gentlemen!</i>

17:24.200 --> 17:26.720
The presentation is tomorrow!
Everything must be ready!

17:26.800 --> 17:28.880
I won't work on the rotary anymore.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.080
Fire me if you want.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.720
-What is this about?
-I can't go on.

17:34.800 --> 17:39.160
It seems that, in the end,
my principles outweigh my dreams.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.800
-Your principles or your girlfriend?
-Both.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.920
Very well, if that's what you want.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.920
The operators know everything.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.920
They won't take this sitting down.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.240
No, I won't leave
and have all of Valladolid laughing at me,

17:57.320 --> 18:01.160
like when Genaro dumped Remedios.
They said she was trash,

18:01.240 --> 18:03.920
-because she was tossed away--
-Listen to me.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.880
You don't have to worry about that.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.560
Remedios was the worst in Valladolid,
but you...

18:09.640 --> 18:10.760
Everyone there loves you.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.240
And that's why it's embarrassing.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.120
I told them all I was coming to see you.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.000
I'm not going back there
like I've been jilted.

18:18.080 --> 18:22.000
-I'll throw myself in the river first.
-The river's almost dry this time of year.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.800
I'll report you to the police.

18:23.880 --> 18:28.360
Report me for what? For leaving you?
No one goes to jail for that.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.200
I'll tell them you're a criminal,
a thief, a murderer.

18:31.280 --> 18:34.000
That's what I'll do.
I'll tell them you're a murderer.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.640
How could I be a murderer?
You know I pass out when I see blood.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.920
I'll do anything
not to be a laughingstock.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.320
I swear, Pablo.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.160
Thank you.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.200
Pablín, what's the matter?

18:57.280 --> 18:59.760
What's with that stupid expression?
What is it? Hmm?

19:00.280 --> 19:01.320
Nothing.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.840
Well, recently everything
is upside down around here.

19:05.920 --> 19:06.920
Heavens.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.360
It seems Marisol likes Madrid.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.760
She won't leave,
and now Marga will lose her job.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.440
And why's that?

19:14.400 --> 19:15.920
Not immediately...

19:16.440 --> 19:19.120
but with Don Carlos' plan,
it's just a matter of time.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.560
So the rumors are true?

19:21.840 --> 19:23.480
They're going to automate the system?

19:24.240 --> 19:26.160
Yes, that's how it looks.

19:27.880 --> 19:32.000
I'm trying to find a way
to keep poor Marga from losing her job,

19:32.080 --> 19:33.800
but she won't be the only one laid off.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.400
No, she won't be.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.320
I'll be right back.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.520
Operator, Barcelona 657, please.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.000
I hope you have good news.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.880
Francisco needn't worry.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.600
The police haven't found a cigarette case.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.400
What's wrong, dear?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.600
I thought that was
what you wanted to hear.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.880
It's one less problem to worry about...

20:34.240 --> 20:36.280
but there are still others.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.080
The girls are about to lose their jobs,
and they blame me

20:39.160 --> 20:41.080
for not having told them
about the rotary.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.840
[sighs] If only you had listened.
I told you that this could happen.

20:45.280 --> 20:50.280
Well, you could steal it,
but you'd break that rich kid's heart.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.360
You're a lost cause, princess.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.360
You carry the weight of the world
on your shoulders.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.280
That's what happens
when you care about people.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.760
I know,
but you're not the only one who cares.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.920
Francisco loves Carlos, too, doesn't he?

21:06.800 --> 21:08.680
He's the company director.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.160
He must have a say in things.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.440
Francisco has no power right now.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.560
But he could...

21:28.720 --> 21:30.280
Did you find the cigarette case?

21:30.360 --> 21:32.640
No.
Victoria says the police don't have it.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.680
-[sighs]
-You can relax.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.920
Good. Good.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.960
But there's something you should know.

21:38.040 --> 21:41.360
The other day, I overheard a conversation
between Carmen and your lawyer.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.520
He told her that it had been
Don Ricardo's last wish

21:45.600 --> 21:48.600
that you should be in charge
of the company.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.160
That can't be true.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.320
Then why would he say that?

21:53.160 --> 21:55.600
He would know the truth
better than anyone.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.880
Yes, but what happened then?

22:00.120 --> 22:01.600
Don Ricardo always supported you...

22:03.640 --> 22:05.320
while Doña Carmen supports Carlos.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.560
She and Indalecio
might have changed the will.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.720
[scoffs]

22:16.200 --> 22:19.440
Why are you only telling me this now?

22:19.520 --> 22:21.200
-That doesn't matter.
-You heard them.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.480
You knew that they
were going to give Carlos

22:23.560 --> 22:27.680
what Don Ricardo had left me,
and you kept quiet. Right?

22:29.880 --> 22:31.640
[sighs and chuckles]

22:32.800 --> 22:36.120
Why am I surprised?
If you love him, why think of me?

22:36.200 --> 22:39.280
You know Carlos didn't deserve
to be left nothing.

22:39.360 --> 22:43.200
I agree with you on that.
That's not what hurts me.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.480
I know you love the company
as much as he does...

22:51.080 --> 22:53.120
but with you in charge,
people won't be laid off...

22:54.240 --> 22:57.880
and that preposterous agreement
with the Uribes will be invalid.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.280
It's what's best for everyone.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.640
Apply to be a seamstress for your cousin?

23:12.720 --> 23:15.640
No. No, to be a dressmaker.
It's more respected.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.520
And, yes, the boss is my cousin Andreu.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.440
He's wonderful. You'll really like him.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.760
We're related on my father's side.
My mother's side is a bit more...

23:22.840 --> 23:25.040
You've heard of a black sheep?
They're a whole flock.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.240
-But it's in Barcelona.
-Yes.

23:27.320 --> 23:31.840
You want to send me to Barcelona?
If you want to be rid of me, just say so!

23:31.920 --> 23:35.000
-Or maybe you don't love me!
-Marga, no, I'm going with you.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.520
I'm going. My cousin needs
an accountant and a seamstress.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.000
I'll be head of accounts.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.040
Oh.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.080
So what's all this about?

23:46.800 --> 23:48.200
I don't understand.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.480
Well, look, it's...

23:52.400 --> 23:57.080
Marisol doesn't want to leave here.
She says she's not leaving Madrid.

23:57.880 --> 24:01.120
She says life will be impossible
back home,

24:01.200 --> 24:03.240
that she's an abandoned woman,

24:03.320 --> 24:04.880
and she's not going back.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.120
If she doesn't leave, we'll have to go.

24:09.720 --> 24:12.800
-But I can't sew, Pablo.
-It can't be that hard if she can do it.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.160
Sorry.

24:15.160 --> 24:18.000
I thought we could ask her to teach you.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.280
No, Pablo. No.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.360
I'm not a seamstress. I'm an operator.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.120
I even did it as a girl
on the local switchboard with my mother.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.400
My grandmother was happy
when I came to Madrid.

24:35.400 --> 24:38.600
She thought I'd get the job and grow.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.400
I didn't believe her, but she was right.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.440
I've learned how to make it on my own.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.720
I've made friends.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.240
I've met the love of my life.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.520
All my happiness is here.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.000
I'm sorry, Pablo, but I'm not leaving.

25:07.800 --> 25:11.400
Barcelona is so far away.
She should go, not us.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.800
Marga, we're not leaving.
We're not leaving.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.600
<i>♪ Because no matter where we are ♪</i>

25:20.720 --> 25:24.160
<i>♪ No other road that I would choose ♪</i>

25:24.240 --> 25:25.440
Now, get ready.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.760
We'll have to put up with her here.
We won't let her mess up our life.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.120
I'm telling you...

25:31.200 --> 25:33.960
when she gets stubborn,
it hurts here.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.840
And no one is more stubborn than she is.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.200
Look, let me tell you something.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.680
I can be a lot worse than her.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.920
We'll make sure she goes far away.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.360
To the other end of Spain if need be.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.280
There's one thing I really like about you.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.280
Your discretion.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.680
You'd never betray the Cifuenteses,
would you?

26:04.480 --> 26:07.560
-No, of course not.
-I thought so.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.960
That's why you obeyed Doña Carmen

26:09.040 --> 26:11.560
when she asked you
to disregard his last wishes.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.280
Don Francisco...

26:13.360 --> 26:15.560
If you're going to speak, don't lie.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.640
-I don't care why you did it.
-[sighs]

26:28.160 --> 26:31.560
Just tell me how much it would cost
to get the original will back.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.960
[chuckles]

26:35.480 --> 26:38.880
Suppose that was the case,
and that's supposing a lot...

26:40.000 --> 26:41.680
why would you think I kept it?

26:42.880 --> 26:45.920
An intelligent man
wouldn't get rid of a valuable document.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.560
You see...

26:50.160 --> 26:52.800
I've been running the company
for four years...

26:53.720 --> 26:57.120
and Don Ricardo's wish, as you well know,

26:57.200 --> 26:59.120
was that I should continue doing so.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.360
Will you help me get back
what's legitimately mine?

27:04.160 --> 27:05.360
[sighs]

27:07.400 --> 27:10.080
Doña Carmen is a very determined woman...

27:10.960 --> 27:14.400
and she won't forget a maneuver like this.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.080
But she's a woman...

27:17.520 --> 27:20.560
and despite the suffragettes' efforts,

27:20.640 --> 27:22.280
this is still a man's world.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.120
Who do you put your money on?

27:28.400 --> 27:30.800
[Carlos] I want the poster much higher,

27:30.880 --> 27:34.600
where everyone can see it,
and the telephones moved to the sides.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.720
Francisco, I need your opinion here.

27:36.800 --> 27:40.200
You still haven't patented the rotary,
and you've called the press.

27:40.280 --> 27:43.120
It's our invention.
The patent is just bureaucracy.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.440
But it's necessary.
Without it, this could be dangerous.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.600
You can't do this kind of demonstration

27:48.680 --> 27:51.040
without the papers
to show it belongs to us.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.480
-Why not wait till the patent's done?
-No.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.920
I want Don Jaime to tell the Uribes
what the rotary can do.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.040
He postponed his trip
to be at the presentation.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.120
Carlos--

28:00.200 --> 28:03.680
Listen, I'm not asking you
to see things like I do. Just trust me.

28:04.920 --> 28:07.160
When my father died,
you said you'd be at my side.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.480
Well, now is the time.

28:09.280 --> 28:13.600
It's true. We won't agree on everything,
neither professionally nor personally.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.360
In fact, these days,
we haven't exactly been very close.

28:17.440 --> 28:20.680
But when you congratulated me
on my engagement, you were sincere.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.920
Then I understood
your reservations about Lidia,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.320
and all of your doubts.
You're my big brother.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.800
-You always look out for me.
-When you let me.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.720

-Nothing.
-Nothing?

33:52.960 --> 33:54.920
Really, he didn't ask for anything.

Something that none of you know about me.

35:23.320 --> 35:26.800
When I came to the company,
it wasn't to be an operator.

35:28.680 --> 35:29.760
I came to steal.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.920
To steal? Why?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.680
The men who were threatening me
made me steal for them.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.480
I was supposed to steal
the rotary blueprints next.

35:40.320 --> 35:44.280
I owe you a lot, and I'd never
forgive myself if I abandoned you.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.280

35:47.480 --> 35:49.080
I'm going to steal the rotary blueprints.

-It's too late. The machine's been built.
-But it isn't patented.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.720

can build and install it.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.240

36:00.320 --> 36:04.400
We can be sure
that we will keep our jobs.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.320

Maybe I'll lose him forever. I don't know.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.720

If there's a chance
you can keep your jobs,

36:23.360 --> 36:24.560
I'll do it.

36:27.320 --> 36:28.920
But I'll need your help.
