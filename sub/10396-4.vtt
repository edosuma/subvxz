editing this show, how
would you tell this story?

39:43.749 --> 39:44.449
This is it.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.516
This is the food stop.

39:45.517 --> 39:46.083
I'm starving.

39:46.084 --> 39:54.084
I am so with you.

39:55.761 --> 39:56.427
That is quite a scene.

39:56.428 --> 39:57.312
Lots of kids.

40:06.538 --> 40:07.218
Want that?

40:22.521 --> 40:25.490
You always want a simple answer
to everything to make it

40:25.491 --> 40:28.626
all make sense, and it seems to,

40:28.627 --> 40:36.627
I don't know, it's just
constantly surprising.

40:38.336 --> 40:40.971
What can you see
everywhere with you go?

40:40.972 --> 40:43.908
In the office, in the market?

40:43.909 --> 40:45.810
People are sinning, making sin.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.812
As a kid I always wondered if

40:47.813 --> 40:52.983
I was good enough to get on
the ark so I always sort of

40:52.984 --> 40:54.485
empathize with the people
who didn't make it.

40:54.486 --> 40:57.588
God, make out of the animals,

40:57.589 --> 41:01.492
come inside the big sheep and

41:01.493 --> 41:08.032
all of the people and
make the families saved.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.900
It is all on ship.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.837
God decides to destroy creation.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.672
Ten generations after he created

41:14.673 --> 41:18.776
everything, so it must
have hurt tremendously.

41:18.777 --> 41:26.777
God will use us.

41:29.354 --> 41:29.788
He brought the ark.

41:29.788 --> 41:30.255
He will send us, too.

41:30.255 --> 41:30.522
Alleluia!

41:30.523 --> 41:31.135
Alleluia.

41:49.875 --> 41:50.875
Pray for yourself.

41:50.876 --> 41:55.813
Pray for your family.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.783
Pray!

42:12.764 --> 42:16.467
God will save Madagascar.
