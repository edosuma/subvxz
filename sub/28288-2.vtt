WEBVTT

00:02.324 --> 00:03.586
They attacked me.

00:03.630 --> 00:06.111
The Templars took up arms
against my army.

00:06.154 --> 00:07.915
The Paris Temple fell
because of you.

00:07.939 --> 00:09.549
I will not see the same
happen here!

00:11.595 --> 00:15.642
Landry is welcome back into
our sacred Order as an Initiate.

00:15.686 --> 00:18.210
You disobeyed
my direct order.

00:18.253 --> 00:20.299
I came to offer you
renewed purpose.

00:20.342 --> 00:22.649
I'm not the greatest swordsman
in Paris.

00:22.693 --> 00:25.696
The greatest swordsman
in all of France.

00:25.739 --> 00:27.785
Pope Boniface is
coming to Paris.

00:29.613 --> 00:30.569
Louis!

00:30.570 --> 00:31.440
Where's mother?

00:34.705 --> 00:36.445
Why would he cut her open
like this?

00:36.489 --> 00:38.665
To remove the child.

00:38.709 --> 00:41.842
The baby is alive.

00:46.368 --> 00:48.588
Mama! Papa!

00:48.632 --> 00:50.851
Have faith, my love!

00:50.895 --> 00:52.331
Come back here,
you little bastard!

00:52.374 --> 00:57.031
No!

00:57.075 --> 00:58.685
Mama! Papa!

00:58.729 --> 01:02.471
Holy Father, Thou just God
of all good souls.

01:02.515 --> 01:06.040
They are prepared,
Father Benedetto.

01:06.084 --> 01:09.827
Do you hear it,
brothers and sisters?

01:09.870 --> 01:12.438
These Cathars
claim to be Christians,

01:12.481 --> 01:15.397
yet even now,
at their final judgment,

01:15.441 --> 01:17.748
they choose to worship
their false gods!

01:17.791 --> 01:19.488
No! Mercy!

01:19.532 --> 01:22.100
Please! I beg mercy!

01:23.884 --> 01:25.407
Open your ears, boy!

01:25.451 --> 01:28.323
They spurn mercy
by refusing to repent.

01:28.367 --> 01:31.152
Outside the church, there can be
no mercy or salvation.

01:33.807 --> 01:36.070
Only punishment.

01:36.114 --> 01:38.682
Now witness
the eternal hellfire

01:38.725 --> 01:41.380
to which God's
infallible justice

01:41.423 --> 01:42.423
condemns the souls
of these Cathar Heretics!

01:42.424 --> 01:46.124
Mama!

01:46.167 --> 01:48.256
Let us pray.

01:48.300 --> 01:53.000
Mater noster, qui es in coelis,
sanctificatur nomen tuum...

01:53.958 --> 01:55.786
...adveniat regnum tuum,

01:55.829 --> 01:59.485
fiat voluntas tua,
sicut in caelo, et in terra.

02:02.009 --> 02:03.619
Mama!

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.807 --> 02:20.027
This is the worst stew
I've ever had.

02:22.073 --> 02:24.640
We eat for sustenance,
not pleasure, Quentin.

02:24.684 --> 02:26.338
Pleasure?

02:26.381 --> 02:28.557
Yeah,
I think I remember her.

02:28.601 --> 02:30.342
Lips as red
as cherries.

02:30.385 --> 02:32.605
Yeah,
she was a peach.

02:32.648 --> 02:33.737
What a "pear."

02:38.829 --> 02:41.875
Remember, Initiates,

02:41.919 --> 02:45.966
you are permitted seven chews
per bite.

02:46.010 --> 02:50.710
One each for the seven gifts
of the Holy Spirit...

02:50.754 --> 02:54.540
wisdom, understanding,
counsel,

02:54.583 --> 02:57.978
fortitude, knowledge,

02:58.022 --> 03:01.068
piety, and awe.

03:01.112 --> 03:02.809
Not gluttony!

03:02.853 --> 03:04.158
Understood?

03:04.202 --> 03:05.856
Yes, Master Talus,
sir.

03:10.861 --> 03:11.968
You should count
your blessings.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.689
When I first became
a Templar,

03:13.733 --> 03:14.841
you were only allowed
three chews and a swallow.

03:16.736 --> 03:18.303
He reminds me
of my father.

03:18.346 --> 03:20.522
Mean as the devil,
miserable prick.

03:20.566 --> 03:22.220
I envy you, Quentin.

03:22.263 --> 03:24.352
At least you knew
your father.

03:24.396 --> 03:28.835
Mine simply... supplied the seed
and wandered off.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.881
Hold your envy.

03:30.924 --> 03:33.709
You see, I'm the eldest son
of Baron Conon de Brienne,

03:33.753 --> 03:35.102
a Knight of Ponthieu,

03:35.146 --> 03:36.756
famous thereabout
for making war

03:36.800 --> 03:39.367
upon his neighbors
while they were off on crusade.

03:39.411 --> 03:42.153
One of those neighbors,
Anselm de Charny,

03:42.196 --> 03:43.850
returned home
with a small army,

03:43.894 --> 03:45.156
took me hostage,

03:45.199 --> 03:47.332
and laid siege
to my father's castle.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.508
Under a white flag
of truce,

03:49.551 --> 03:51.249
de Charny approached
the curtain wall,

03:51.292 --> 03:52.467
held a sword to my neck,

03:52.511 --> 03:53.991
and demanded
my father's surrender,

03:54.034 --> 03:57.385
in exchange
for my life.

03:57.429 --> 04:00.301
And my father emerged
on the ramparts,

04:00.345 --> 04:01.257
grabbed his crotch,

04:01.259 --> 04:04.523
and yelled,

04:04.566 --> 04:07.700
"Go ahead and slit
the little bugger's throat."

04:13.053 --> 04:14.726
Nah, still be better
to raised by a bastard

04:14.750 --> 04:15.969
than to be one, right?

04:17.666 --> 04:19.625
Landry's right
about that.

04:19.668 --> 04:21.192
Ah? You, too, Kelton?

04:21.235 --> 04:22.889
Yeah.

04:22.933 --> 04:25.674
I was born a bastard,
and I'll die a bastard.

04:25.718 --> 04:28.460
Well, best to live life
as a holy bastard, eh?

04:30.027 --> 04:31.376
And what about you,
Rhone?

04:31.419 --> 04:33.073
Did someone try and kill you
as a child?

04:33.117 --> 04:34.814
That's why
you're always praying?

04:34.858 --> 04:37.686
No.

04:37.730 --> 04:40.907
Not me.

04:40.951 --> 04:42.300
I just did eight chews.

04:50.221 --> 04:51.875
Seven chews.

04:51.918 --> 04:54.007
No more. No less.

04:57.271 --> 04:58.925
Landry.

04:58.969 --> 05:01.101
I grant you the honor
of cleaning up

05:01.145 --> 05:03.887
after this brazen
young fool.

05:30.652 --> 05:32.132
You will do
no such thing.

05:32.176 --> 05:33.481
Do not presume
to tell me

05:33.525 --> 05:35.701
what I can
and cannot do, boy.

05:35.744 --> 05:37.311
Why are you here?

05:37.355 --> 05:40.445
To mourn,
of course.

05:40.488 --> 05:44.231
And I have not been a boy
for a very long time, Father.

05:49.541 --> 05:51.804
Yes, of course.

05:51.847 --> 05:52.979
You loved her.

05:53.023 --> 05:56.809
You should mourn her,
my son.

05:56.852 --> 06:00.291
As is right
and proper.

06:00.334 --> 06:01.857
And yet
she betrayed you.

06:01.901 --> 06:03.859
She betrayed
all of us.

06:03.903 --> 06:07.385
Yet she was still my mother,
and your wife.

06:07.428 --> 06:08.995
The Queen of France.

06:09.039 --> 06:11.432
The people
still love her.

06:11.476 --> 06:13.739
They know nothing
of her impropriety.

06:13.782 --> 06:18.178
They think she died trying
to bear you yet another heir.

06:18.222 --> 06:21.051
You must allow her
a proper royal funeral.

06:23.357 --> 06:27.579
I would sooner swear fealty
to the Mamluk Sultan.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.412
There will be
no funeral.

06:47.642 --> 06:49.209
You failed!

06:49.253 --> 06:51.690
No meals
for the next two days!

06:55.041 --> 06:56.216
The task
is impossible!

06:56.260 --> 06:57.672
The wall cannot be climbed
in the rain!

06:57.696 --> 07:00.873
Your turn!

07:00.916 --> 07:03.310
Landry will fail,
just like the others.

07:05.617 --> 07:07.793
Ah!

07:07.836 --> 07:10.622
Give thanks unto God,

07:10.665 --> 07:15.714
for when he rains on us,
he rains on our enemies as well!

07:15.757 --> 07:20.371
Now, look to Psalm 133
for guidance...

07:20.414 --> 07:23.461
and climb
that fucking wall!

07:23.504 --> 07:26.246
You're a former Temple Master...
what's the trick?

07:26.290 --> 07:28.007
Uh, this trial wasn't part
of my initiation.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.206
I've never done it before.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.990
What about Psalm 133?

07:31.034 --> 07:32.339
What of it?

07:32.383 --> 07:33.775
"Behold how good
and pleasant it is

07:33.819 --> 07:35.777
when brothers dwell together
in unity."

07:35.821 --> 07:37.431
Well, what are you
waiting for...

07:37.475 --> 07:39.303
your balls to drop?!

07:39.346 --> 07:42.045
Climb that wall,
you pissant slugs!

07:53.404 --> 07:55.188
Aah!

07:58.322 --> 07:59.671
Aah!

08:03.544 --> 08:05.372
Ohh.
It's no use.

08:05.416 --> 08:07.113
The stone is
too slippery.

08:07.157 --> 08:09.277
Say, Master High and Mighty,
what are you waiting for?

08:14.990 --> 08:19.169
"When brothers dwell together
in unity."

08:19.212 --> 08:22.215
This trial is
about brotherhood.

08:22.259 --> 08:23.173
Teamwork.

08:23.174 --> 08:24.696
What are you on about?

08:24.739 --> 08:26.630
How the hell do we get
to the top without a rope?

08:26.654 --> 08:28.482
Or a ladder?

08:28.526 --> 08:30.963
We become the ladder.

08:31.006 --> 08:33.660
Quentin, you brace yourself
next to me.

08:33.705 --> 08:36.273
He's lost his mind.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.188
Each man climbs
on the shoulders of the next

08:39.232 --> 08:41.015
until they reach the top,

08:41.059 --> 08:42.756
then help pull
their brothers up.

08:42.801 --> 08:44.759
Ready?

09:30.414 --> 09:32.416
I can't reach!

09:32.459 --> 09:34.548
We need another man!

09:36.768 --> 09:38.726
Climb.
Be quick about it.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.641
You sure?

09:40.685 --> 09:42.077
No. But do it anyway.

09:42.121 --> 09:44.210
Okay.

09:57.441 --> 09:58.441
Come on!

09:58.442 --> 09:59.921
Go!

10:07.102 --> 10:08.278
Aah!

10:15.241 --> 10:16.242
Quentin!

10:18.157 --> 10:20.333
Quentin!

10:20.377 --> 10:23.423
Quentin!

10:23.467 --> 10:25.120
Sorry.

10:25.164 --> 10:26.992
Got my bell rung.

10:27.035 --> 10:30.256
Quentin, get up
before my back breaks.

11:09.774 --> 11:12.559
Master Talus,
I request permission

11:12.603 --> 11:15.823
to lower a rope
and help my brothers climb,

11:15.867 --> 11:19.000
as they helped me!

11:19.044 --> 11:20.959
Permission granted.

11:53.383 --> 11:55.559
Progress, De Nogaret?

11:55.602 --> 11:58.257
The hunt for Landry du Lauzon
closes in, my liege.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.235
It is only a matter of time
before his head is delivered

12:00.259 --> 12:03.088
to the palace.

12:03.131 --> 12:05.395
Care to wager on that?

12:05.438 --> 12:08.267
If you lose, I'll be sure your
head's delivered in its place.

12:12.184 --> 12:14.404
No doubt the Templars
are congratulating themselves

12:14.447 --> 12:16.319
on having crept in like thieves
in the night

12:16.362 --> 12:19.017
to steal away with
their secret cache of gold.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.106
And yet they still left you
in possession

12:21.149 --> 12:24.022
of their most valuable treasure
of all, my liege.

12:28.069 --> 12:30.158
The Paris Temple itself.

12:30.202 --> 12:32.813
It's yours, Louis.

12:32.857 --> 12:35.947
Use it to launch a campaign
against the Templars.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.731
Oh.

12:37.775 --> 12:42.736
Sincere thanks for such
a splendid gift, Father.

12:42.780 --> 12:45.391
From here, I will see
to the complete

12:45.435 --> 12:47.219
and utter destruction
of the Knights Templar

12:47.262 --> 12:49.090
throughout all of France,

12:49.134 --> 12:53.225
and forfeiture of their wealth
and property to the Crown.

12:53.268 --> 12:54.550
I fully concur
with these brilliant

12:54.574 --> 12:57.272
and glorious objectives.

12:57.316 --> 13:00.667
Yet I would be remiss
in my duties

13:00.711 --> 13:02.800
if I did not respectfully ask
Your Majesty to wait.

13:02.843 --> 13:04.323
Wait for what?

13:04.367 --> 13:06.673
For me to build
an ironclad legal case

13:06.717 --> 13:10.851
against the Templars on charges
of heresy and blasphemy.

13:10.895 --> 13:12.679
These so-called
"Soldiers of God"

13:12.723 --> 13:14.875
still have the full support
of the pope and his church.

13:14.899 --> 13:16.746
Their numbers are legion
throughout all of Europe.

13:16.770 --> 13:19.730
And, sad as it is
to say,

13:19.773 --> 13:23.124
they are still widely revered
right here in France.

13:23.168 --> 13:24.865
To move against them
without absolute proof

13:24.909 --> 13:27.564
of their crimes
will cause problems.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.087
But I believe I have
the solution.

13:29.130 --> 13:30.915
Spit it out,
De Nogaret.

13:34.005 --> 13:36.224
Who better to detail
the grievous crimes

13:36.268 --> 13:41.099
of the Templars than
a former Templar himself?

13:47.192 --> 13:49.237
See that it's done
quickly.

13:49.281 --> 13:51.979
Now leave us.

13:52.023 --> 13:53.981
Of course,
Your Majesty.

13:54.025 --> 13:55.374
Your Grace.

13:59.596 --> 14:03.426
To hell with De Nogaret
and his schemes, father.

14:03.469 --> 14:05.732
Let me track down
Landry.

14:05.776 --> 14:08.518
I will make him suffer
like no man has ever suffered

14:08.561 --> 14:10.389
for what he has done
to our family.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.914
No, I have an even more vital
task for you,

14:13.958 --> 14:17.744
which no one else
can be trusted with.

14:17.788 --> 14:19.659
The Book of Isaiah
tells us,

14:19.703 --> 14:22.227
"The wolf shall dwell
with the lamb,

14:22.270 --> 14:25.709
and a child
shall lead them."

14:25.752 --> 14:29.582
Gather your wolves,
my son.

14:29.626 --> 14:33.325
There is prey to be hunted.

14:34.631 --> 14:36.937
Hey, Rhone.

14:43.204 --> 14:46.164
Rhone. Rhone!

14:46.207 --> 14:47.861
You must commit those prayers
to memory

14:47.905 --> 14:49.709
and get rid of that thing
before it gets you into trouble.

14:49.733 --> 14:54.172
But it was, um...
It was a gift.

14:54.215 --> 14:55.869
From my mother.

14:55.913 --> 14:57.891
It doesn't matter if it was
from Master Talus himself.

14:57.915 --> 15:00.091
Once you embrace the life
of a Templar,

15:00.134 --> 15:02.615
you must strip yourself
of all worldly possessions.

15:02.659 --> 15:04.399
Past or otherwise.

15:12.059 --> 15:13.931
Well, my mother,
she, um...

15:13.974 --> 15:15.561
She told me
that if I recite these prayers

15:15.585 --> 15:17.021
each day
for a year,

15:17.064 --> 15:18.781
it'll add up to the exact
same number of blows

15:18.805 --> 15:21.416
that Christ endured
before his Crucifixion.

15:21.460 --> 15:22.742
She said
that this would prevent me

15:22.766 --> 15:24.115
from dying
an unnatural death.

15:25.638 --> 15:30.164
Rhone, as much as I love
Christ our Savior,

15:30.208 --> 15:32.819
when it comes to preventing me
from dying an unnatural death,

15:32.863 --> 15:34.580
I'll choose a sword
over a prayer every time.

15:35.996 --> 15:37.781
Look, I don't know
about the rest of you,

15:37.824 --> 15:41.349
but I joined the Temple
in order to master the sword

15:41.393 --> 15:42.960
and earn the title
of Soldier of God,

15:43.003 --> 15:45.353
not to fetch rocks
like a mule

15:45.397 --> 15:47.834
or count the chews
on a crust of slop

15:47.878 --> 15:51.055
or climb the walls
like a squirrel.

15:51.098 --> 15:53.927
It isn't about the wall

15:53.971 --> 15:56.451
or the food
or the rocks.

15:56.495 --> 16:02.066
It's about discipline,
obedience, humility.

16:02.109 --> 16:04.547
Following orders that you think
might mean nothing

16:04.590 --> 16:06.157
without hesitation,

16:06.200 --> 16:10.857
so that when orders come
when arrows fall

16:10.901 --> 16:14.469
and hooves trample
and blood flows,

16:14.513 --> 16:16.689
you will do the same.

16:16.733 --> 16:18.212
Without hesitation.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.434
Trust me, Rhone.

16:22.477 --> 16:23.783
Get rid of that thing.

16:47.546 --> 16:50.201
You wanted to see me,
Father.

16:52.464 --> 16:55.467
You're burning
Mother's clothes?

16:55.510 --> 16:58.078
Your mother tears me apart
from the grave.

17:01.299 --> 17:03.475
I wanted to tell you
that the plans

17:03.518 --> 17:06.391
for your marriage to Edward
have been finalized.

17:06.434 --> 17:07.740
You will be wed soon

17:07.784 --> 17:10.656
and begin your new life
as his queen.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.267
Mother would not have
approved

17:13.310 --> 17:15.313
of you sending me
across the sea

17:15.356 --> 17:17.576
to marry
a notorious sodomite.

17:18.751 --> 17:21.798
Your mother is dead.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.494
And even
while yet she lived,

17:23.538 --> 17:26.628
it was I who made the decisions
about your future.

17:26.672 --> 17:28.674
You will be
Queen of England,

17:28.718 --> 17:30.328
as your brother will be
King of France.

17:30.371 --> 17:32.330
I will have peace
with England,

17:32.373 --> 17:36.900
and you shall have a husband
and a crown.

17:36.943 --> 17:39.076
That should be more than enough
to make you happy.

17:40.773 --> 17:42.906
Thank you, Father.

17:45.735 --> 17:46.779
Come.

17:51.305 --> 17:52.872
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

17:52.916 --> 17:54.482
Your Grace.

17:54.526 --> 17:57.181
What now, De Nogaret?

17:57.224 --> 17:59.531
Have you a head
to deliver?

17:59.574 --> 18:01.881
Only the head
of the Catholic Church.

18:01.925 --> 18:03.491
Pope Boniface has arrived
in Paris

18:03.535 --> 18:06.625
to pay his respects
to the late Queen Joan.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.583
And to see you squirm.

18:19.507 --> 18:24.817
The Bishop of Rome,
His Holiness, Pope Boniface.

18:24.861 --> 18:26.166
Your Holiness.

18:26.210 --> 18:27.864
Philip.

18:47.448 --> 18:51.061
I know that the two of us have
had our differences of late.

18:51.104 --> 18:54.151
You did, after all, launch
an attack on the Templars,

18:54.194 --> 18:57.763
the most devoted
of my Holy Knights.

18:57.807 --> 19:02.855
But we must lay aside discord
on such a weighty occasion

19:02.899 --> 19:07.947
and allow distrust
to be replaced by fellowship.

19:07.991 --> 19:11.081
Allow me to offer
my sincere condolences

19:11.124 --> 19:15.172
on the untimely death
of our beloved Queen Joan.

19:15.215 --> 19:19.742
To lose such a beautiful
and loving woman

19:19.785 --> 19:21.831
must have been
a terrible blow for you,

19:21.874 --> 19:25.704
as it is
to all of France.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.532
Thank you,
Your Holiness.

19:27.575 --> 19:33.712
She was
a... remarkable woman.

19:38.238 --> 19:41.154
But enough of platitudes.

19:41.198 --> 19:43.461
It has come to my attention
that Your Holiness

19:43.504 --> 19:46.769
will soon issue a Papal Bull
concerning the relationship

19:46.812 --> 19:50.033
between secular
and spiritual authority.

19:50.076 --> 19:53.993
As a good Christian,
I wish to know more.

19:54.037 --> 19:57.301
I appreciate your interest
in this matter, Your Majesty,

19:57.344 --> 19:59.520
but now is hardly the time
nor the place

19:59.564 --> 20:00.957
for such a discussion.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.282
You're in
the throne room

20:02.306 --> 20:03.746
of the most Christian King
of France.

20:03.786 --> 20:07.833
Is there a better time
or place?

20:07.877 --> 20:09.748
Very well.

20:09.792 --> 20:13.186
I will boil it down so that
even an ungodly sycophant

20:13.230 --> 20:17.843
like your Minister De Nogaret
can comprehend.

20:17.887 --> 20:21.629
As the Apostle said,
"There is no power but of God,

20:21.673 --> 20:25.198
and the powers that be
are ordained of God."

20:25.242 --> 20:28.201
And who is to speak for God,
if not I,

20:28.245 --> 20:30.987
His Vicar on Earth?

20:31.030 --> 20:35.295
And so I declared
that submission

20:35.339 --> 20:37.515
on the part
of every man,

20:37.558 --> 20:44.558
be he serf or Royal Counselor
or king...

20:44.609 --> 20:46.567
submission
to the Bishop of Rome

20:46.611 --> 20:51.746
is absolutely necessary
for his salvation.

20:51.790 --> 20:53.923
To put it simply,

20:53.966 --> 20:57.143
submit or be damned.

21:03.019 --> 21:05.804
Initiates, assemble!

21:10.853 --> 21:14.987
Each of you chose to give up
your worldly possessions

21:15.031 --> 21:17.120
and turn your backs
on who you were

21:17.163 --> 21:20.645
before you entered
our sacred house, did you not?

21:20.688 --> 21:22.734
Yes, Initiate Master.

21:22.777 --> 21:28.479
Yet it appears one of you
has chosen differently.

21:31.395 --> 21:34.833
Isn't that right,
Initiate Rhone?

21:36.879 --> 21:38.184
Strip!

21:49.413 --> 21:51.023
Hmm...

21:58.378 --> 22:01.164
But before we deal
with this,

22:01.207 --> 22:06.386
we must first reward the source
of this revelation.

22:06.430 --> 22:07.910
Initiate Michael.

22:11.652 --> 22:13.567
Get out of my sight.

22:13.611 --> 22:14.917
What?

22:14.960 --> 22:16.831
The Temple
is no place for those

22:16.875 --> 22:18.355
who would betray
their brothers.

22:18.398 --> 22:20.052
But, Master Talus...

22:20.096 --> 22:24.100
Leave this Temple
before I beat you to death.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.588
Hmm...

22:34.632 --> 22:39.506
Master Talus,
it isn't Rhone's prayer scroll.

22:39.550 --> 22:40.986
It's mine.

22:41.030 --> 22:43.336
I hid it in his clothes
to escape punishment.

22:43.380 --> 22:46.122
Do you take me for a fool,
Landry?

22:46.165 --> 22:47.601
No, sir.

22:47.645 --> 22:49.212
I salute your attempt
to spare Rhone

22:49.255 --> 22:51.475
from my righteous wrath.

22:51.518 --> 22:54.434
So instead
of punishing him...

22:54.478 --> 22:57.611
I'm punishing you all!

22:57.655 --> 23:00.223
Strength training
with sacks of rock

23:00.266 --> 23:02.834
from now until sunset.

23:04.401 --> 23:07.970
Landry, Rhone, Quentin,
Kelton, Vasant.

23:08.013 --> 23:09.928
Not you.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.932
I have a different challenge
for you worthless pig-humpers.

23:13.976 --> 23:16.500
Go into the forest,
find a tree

23:16.543 --> 23:19.329
suitable
for our log physical training,

23:19.372 --> 23:21.853
cut it down, debark it,

23:21.896 --> 23:24.551
and bring it
back here...

23:24.595 --> 23:26.989
on foot.

23:27.032 --> 23:29.252
Master Talus, it'll be night
before we get back.

23:29.295 --> 23:30.993
So it will.

23:31.036 --> 23:32.951
You best take care
not to chop off

23:32.995 --> 23:35.171
each other's fingers and toes
in the dark.

23:47.009 --> 23:49.968
The Baptismal Rolls, Your Grace?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.709
I would have
the most recent.

23:51.752 --> 23:54.233
Every infant birth recorded
in the past three months.

23:57.497 --> 23:58.759
Here you are.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.720
Names, dates of baptism,

24:02.763 --> 24:04.809
and places of residence
for Paris

24:04.852 --> 24:06.724
and the surrounding
townships.

24:06.767 --> 24:08.726
Excellent.
And the others.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.343
A... donation
for the Cathedral.

24:17.387 --> 24:19.476
With the greatest respect,
Your Grace,

24:19.519 --> 24:22.000
you cannot take
those scrolls.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.350
They are the only proof
those little Lambs of God

24:24.394 --> 24:26.874
have undergone
the Sacrament of Holy Baptism,

24:26.918 --> 24:31.053
thereby guaranteeing them
entry into heaven.

24:31.096 --> 24:34.534
Furthermore,
they are church property,

24:34.578 --> 24:38.756
which even your father,
the king, has no claim over.

24:38.799 --> 24:41.498
I was baptized.

24:41.541 --> 24:44.805
Does that guarantee me
entry into heaven?

24:44.849 --> 24:47.069
It does, Your Grace,

24:47.112 --> 24:49.245
unless you commit
a mortal sin,

24:49.288 --> 24:51.899
in which case,
you must, of course, repent

24:51.943 --> 24:53.988
and confess
to gain absolution.

24:54.032 --> 24:57.253
Of course.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.472
But, uh, I won't be sinning
today.

25:01.953 --> 25:03.259
They will.

25:45.779 --> 25:48.565
Nothing good happens
in the woods after dark.

25:48.608 --> 25:53.004
They're filled with wolves,
boars, and bats.

25:53.047 --> 25:56.399
Oh, bats are
the devil's familiars.

25:56.442 --> 25:58.227
Witches use their blood
to fly.

25:58.270 --> 26:00.272
Seen lots of flying witches,
have you, brother?

26:00.316 --> 26:01.839
I have it
on good authority.

26:01.882 --> 26:04.015
Bats aren't all bad.

26:04.058 --> 26:05.495
My uncle says if you wash
your hair

26:05.538 --> 26:07.125
with powdered bat wings,
you'll never go bald.

26:08.889 --> 26:10.209
Well, it's a bit too late
for you,

26:10.239 --> 26:13.938
isn't it, Vasant,
you poor bastard?

26:13.981 --> 26:15.505
This one.

26:15.548 --> 26:19.639
Perfect. We can take it down
this ridge here.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.861
Come on then, baldy.

26:41.531 --> 26:43.446
Hello, Anne.

26:43.489 --> 26:45.578
Mother Superior told me
you were still working.

26:49.582 --> 26:50.844
Is that the new Bible?

26:50.888 --> 26:52.455
Aye.
Mm.

26:52.498 --> 26:56.372
Brother Angus' handiwork
of the past six years.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.331
We will make a generous donation
to the convent

26:59.375 --> 27:01.420
if you apply your talents
to this Good Book

27:01.464 --> 27:04.771
and, uh, illuminate
the manuscript.

27:08.471 --> 27:09.776
I'd almost forgotten.

27:09.820 --> 27:12.257
What?

27:12.301 --> 27:16.130
How your eyes appear
by candlelight.

27:16.174 --> 27:18.089
It's like they're filled
with fire.

27:21.527 --> 27:22.876
Thank you, Tancrede.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.227
I will begin work on it
next week.

27:27.577 --> 27:30.841
How is she?

27:30.884 --> 27:32.973
Well, why not come see
for yourself?

27:41.112 --> 27:45.029
The wet nurse feeds her
three or four times a day.

27:45.072 --> 27:47.379
The rest of the time,
she mostly sleeps.

27:47.423 --> 27:49.251
But I do take you
out on the grass once a day

27:49.294 --> 27:51.296
to bathe in Our Lord's sunshine,
didn't I?

27:51.340 --> 27:53.429
Ohh.

27:55.822 --> 27:57.389
She almost never cries.

27:59.348 --> 28:01.524
She takes after
her father.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.703
Hullo, Eve.

28:06.746 --> 28:07.878
Whoa.

28:07.921 --> 28:09.793
Hullo.

28:09.836 --> 28:11.577
Hullo.

28:11.621 --> 28:15.320
Hullo. How are we?

28:29.900 --> 28:31.336
Do you hear that?

28:31.380 --> 28:32.511
I didn't hear anything.

28:32.555 --> 28:33.773
Shh, shh, shh!

28:48.005 --> 28:51.400
Take the axes and the saw.

28:51.443 --> 28:54.272
Douse your torches.

28:54.316 --> 28:57.754
Follow me.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.603
Dies irae,
dies illa Solvet Saeclum.

29:01.627 --> 29:04.326
Teste Satan cum sibylla.

29:04.369 --> 29:06.893
Quantos tremor est futurus,

29:06.937 --> 29:09.896
Quando Vindex est venturus

29:09.940 --> 29:12.508
Cuncta stricted discussurus.

29:13.552 --> 29:17.600
Dies irae, dies illa!

29:17.643 --> 29:19.428
Veni, omnipotens aeterne
diabolus!

29:19.471 --> 29:20.994
Luciferians.

29:22.735 --> 29:26.391
Solvet Saeclum in favilla.

29:26.435 --> 29:29.351
Teste Satan cum sibylla.

29:29.394 --> 29:31.222
Quantos tremor est futurus.

29:39.273 --> 29:44.322
Veni,
omnipotens aeterne diabolus!

30:02.471 --> 30:04.255
Trinity formation!

30:17.616 --> 30:19.009
Aah!

30:19.052 --> 30:21.664
Vasant, hold formation!

30:27.974 --> 30:29.802
Help me, Rhone!

30:32.239 --> 30:35.808
Quentin, Quentin.

30:39.159 --> 30:43.163
Landry, help me!
Quickly!

30:43.207 --> 30:45.122
Over here! Help me!

30:45.165 --> 30:47.603
Quentin! Quentin!

30:48.995 --> 30:50.562
Stay with us, lad.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.568
Come on.
We need to go.

30:56.612 --> 30:57.961
Back to the Temple.
Come on!

30:58.004 --> 30:59.658
Come on! Move!

30:59.702 --> 31:00.790
Over there!

31:00.833 --> 31:03.357
The woods!

31:03.401 --> 31:07.449
I think I see them.

31:08.493 --> 31:09.363
Somebody help!

31:09.364 --> 31:10.452
Draper!

31:10.495 --> 31:11.495
Bring me Draper!

31:11.496 --> 31:12.802
Help us!

31:13.846 --> 31:15.674
Somebody. Help us!

31:24.161 --> 31:25.858
Save him, Draper.

31:25.902 --> 31:27.251
Draper, please.

31:27.294 --> 31:28.731
Please save him.

31:32.169 --> 31:35.128
I can't.

31:35.172 --> 31:36.826
Quentin's dead.

31:42.135 --> 31:43.572
I'm sorry, Landry.

31:43.615 --> 31:44.964
What happened?

31:45.008 --> 31:46.662
We were attacked
from the forest.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.098
By Luciferians.

31:48.141 --> 31:49.534
Devil worshipers.

31:49.578 --> 31:51.101
Landry brought this
upon us.

31:51.144 --> 31:53.233
He's cursed. He's brought
the devil into our house!

31:53.277 --> 31:56.410
Enough, Berenger!

31:56.454 --> 31:58.369
Draper, take an escort
of Brother Knights

31:58.412 --> 32:00.197
into the woods
and send a rider back

32:00.240 --> 32:02.199
as soon as you discover
the location

32:02.242 --> 32:04.331
of these Satan-worshipping
heathens.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.855
Yes, Grandmaster.

32:05.898 --> 32:07.770
Bring him inside.

32:07.813 --> 32:10.729
This is your doing,
Landry.

32:10.773 --> 32:12.470
Yours alone.

32:24.438 --> 32:26.223
Give me a horse!

32:30.662 --> 32:33.186
Give me
a fucking horse!

32:33.230 --> 32:35.362
Where do you think
you're going?

32:35.406 --> 32:37.103
I'm joining
the scouting party.

32:37.147 --> 32:39.584
You've done enough
already.

32:39.628 --> 32:43.283
But I'm the one who knows
their last location.

32:43.327 --> 32:45.764
And I didn't break
formation.

32:45.808 --> 32:49.463
I held fast, and I fought
alongside my brothers.

32:49.507 --> 32:53.990
And yet
you still failed.

32:54.033 --> 32:55.818
Quentin died out there,
Landry.

32:55.861 --> 32:57.950
On your watch.

32:57.994 --> 33:01.084
Now you think if you go kill
some goat-faced heretics,

33:01.127 --> 33:04.522
it'll make you feel better
about losing that boy.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.393
But this is a task
for Templars,

33:06.437 --> 33:07.786
and you're not a Templar
anymore.

33:07.830 --> 33:10.920
You're an Initiate.

33:10.963 --> 33:13.618
And I don't give a shit
how you feel!

33:21.626 --> 33:23.454
Hyah-hyah!

33:36.162 --> 33:39.165
The Luciferians are said
to dwell within these woods.

33:47.391 --> 33:50.655
Hyah!

34:11.197 --> 34:12.677
Strip the bodies.

34:36.788 --> 34:40.096
We could not drive you
out of our Temple.

34:40.139 --> 34:43.186
So we'll burn the devil
out of yours.

34:43.228 --> 34:46.362
We drive you from us,
unclean spirit,

34:46.406 --> 34:49.453
satanic power,
infernal invader.

34:49.496 --> 34:50.976
May you be snatched away

34:51.020 --> 34:52.761
and driven from the soul
of this man,

34:52.804 --> 34:54.284
Landry du Lauzon,

34:54.327 --> 34:56.025
made in the image of God

34:56.068 --> 34:58.177
and redeemed by the blood
of our Blessed Lord and Savior,

34:58.201 --> 35:00.029
Jesus Christ.

35:00.072 --> 35:03.467
God the Father
commands you.

35:03.510 --> 35:05.687
God the Son commands you.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.471
God the Holy Spirit
commands you.

36:35.602 --> 36:37.169
Landry?

36:50.748 --> 36:52.837
Who did this to you?

36:52.881 --> 36:54.143
I did it to myself.

36:54.186 --> 36:56.406
Don't lie to me,
brother.

36:56.449 --> 36:59.322
Who committed
this vile act?

36:59.365 --> 37:00.714
There is no place
in the Temple

37:00.758 --> 37:02.455
for a man who would betray
his brothers.

37:14.250 --> 37:15.642
Alt! Chi va li?

37:36.663 --> 37:39.275
Aah!

38:04.517 --> 38:06.563
De Nogaret?

38:06.606 --> 38:09.566
How in our Lord's Holy Name
did you get past my guards?

38:09.609 --> 38:10.872
Capitano!

38:10.915 --> 38:14.484
Capitano Malatesta!

38:14.527 --> 38:17.008
No one will be coming to
your aid tonight, Your Holiness.

38:18.314 --> 38:20.533
Surely, good King Philip
can't condone

38:20.577 --> 38:23.449
any harm befalling
the Holy Father?

38:23.493 --> 38:26.322
You told him to submit
or be damned.

38:26.365 --> 38:28.150
How did you think
he would react?

38:28.193 --> 38:30.108
Did you think he would fall down
on bended knee

38:30.152 --> 38:31.327
and kiss your ring
himself?

38:31.370 --> 38:33.155
He misunderstood.

38:33.198 --> 38:36.854
I meant that only with regards
to spiritual matters,

38:36.898 --> 38:38.682
such as sacrament
and liturgy.

38:38.725 --> 38:40.336
Oh.

38:40.379 --> 38:43.078
Well, what about matters
of heresy,

38:43.121 --> 38:45.689
torture,

38:45.732 --> 38:50.520
and... execution?

38:50.563 --> 38:53.131
Each time you visited
Paris,

38:53.175 --> 38:56.134
I hoped that somehow
you would recognize me.

38:56.178 --> 39:00.095
Do you recall the town
of Saint-FÃ©lix-de-Caraman,

39:00.138 --> 39:02.793
in the Occitan?

39:02.836 --> 39:05.230
Do you remember
a Cathar husband and wife,

39:05.274 --> 39:09.539
Antoine Gauthier
and Florence de BÃ©arn?

39:09.582 --> 39:11.933
You lit the fire
yourself...

39:11.976 --> 39:15.719
the fire
that burned them alive.

39:15.762 --> 39:20.724
Don't you remember that,
Father Benedetto?

39:20.767 --> 39:23.596
Mama! Papa!

39:27.078 --> 39:30.212
I, uh...

39:30.255 --> 39:32.605
I was just a child.

39:32.649 --> 39:33.867
I went to church.

39:33.911 --> 39:35.652
I prayed to the Lord.

39:35.695 --> 39:37.088
I believed in everything
the Bible

39:37.132 --> 39:39.612
and men like you
taught me.

39:39.656 --> 39:40.918
And then you
took it all away.

39:43.268 --> 39:45.140
I tried to keep
the faith.

39:45.183 --> 39:49.753
I tried to keep believing that
somehow, some way,

39:49.796 --> 39:52.669
I would come to understand
how a just and merciful God

39:52.712 --> 39:55.454
could allow men such as you
to inflict

39:55.498 --> 39:58.370
such unjust suffering
in His name.

39:58.414 --> 40:03.593
But when you're ripped
from your mother's arms...

40:03.636 --> 40:05.334
and made to watch
her flesh sizzle

40:05.377 --> 40:12.377
and... burn like... a pig
on a spit,

40:13.646 --> 40:15.474
all that is left to believe in
is the vagary

40:15.518 --> 40:19.087
and brutality
of life itself.

40:19.130 --> 40:22.264
No God, no devil,

40:22.307 --> 40:24.962
no heaven nor hell...

40:25.006 --> 40:28.226
other than the one
wretched men like you create.

40:28.270 --> 40:34.841
After you killed them,
I was alone in the world,

40:34.885 --> 40:37.061
living in the gutter,

40:37.105 --> 40:39.672
fighting vermin
for crumbs of bread.

40:43.546 --> 40:46.244
Then my uncle found me
and taught me Latin

40:46.288 --> 40:52.294
and the law
for one purpose only...

40:52.337 --> 40:56.907
so that I might free as much
of this world as possible

40:56.950 --> 40:59.257
from false prophets
such as you.

41:05.785 --> 41:09.398
I believe...

41:09.441 --> 41:12.966
I do remember your mother
and father, De Nogaret.

41:16.492 --> 41:20.670
They were heretics
and blasphemers,

41:20.713 --> 41:24.108
and they deserved
their fate.

41:24.152 --> 41:27.764
What right have you to judge me
or my actions?

41:29.766 --> 41:32.943
I am St. Peter's successor,

41:32.986 --> 41:36.294
the Holy Father
of the One True Church,

41:36.338 --> 41:40.385
and you are just an errand boy
for a petty tyrant

41:40.429 --> 41:43.954
who doesn't know his place
in the proper order of things.

41:43.997 --> 41:47.523
Tell me, does His Majesty
the King know

41:47.566 --> 41:51.048
that you harbor
such pagan thoughts?

41:51.092 --> 41:53.659
Oh.
Oh, no, no, of course not,

41:53.703 --> 41:57.315
because if he did,
he'd have you flayed alive.

41:57.359 --> 42:01.580
You can't even share with
your master your true beliefs.

42:01.624 --> 42:05.062
No, I pity you,
De Nogaret!

42:05.106 --> 42:07.282
I pity you!

42:07.325 --> 42:08.935
Aah!

42:14.898 --> 42:16.769
I know you.

42:16.813 --> 42:19.555
You're a Templar,
a Soldier of God!

42:19.598 --> 42:21.165
Defend me!

42:21.209 --> 42:24.386
I was a Templar.

42:24.429 --> 42:25.561
Not anymore.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.051
King Philip demands you vacate
the Holy See

42:38.095 --> 42:41.620
to make room for a more blessed
and reasonable pontiff.

42:41.664 --> 42:44.449
But the means
of your removal...

42:44.493 --> 42:46.930
Well, he left that
up to me.

42:52.501 --> 42:54.764
You will be pleased to know
that after you are dead,

42:54.807 --> 42:56.437
your earthly remains
will be bound together

42:56.461 --> 42:57.549
with that of heretics.

42:59.508 --> 43:00.770
What's that?

43:00.813 --> 43:02.641
You beg for mercy?

43:02.685 --> 43:04.774
Open your ears, old man!

43:04.817 --> 43:07.951
You spurn mercy
by refusing to repent!

43:40.853 --> 43:42.638
The Pope is dead.

43:45.380 --> 43:47.164
Long live the Pope.
