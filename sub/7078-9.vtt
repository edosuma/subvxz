when I went to rehab.

16:38.599 --> 16:41.334
And I guess part of me
was mad at you

16:41.368 --> 16:42.869
for siding with her,

16:42.903 --> 16:47.273
so I thought you moving in here
was some kind of moral victory.

16:47.308 --> 16:48.308
What? No.

16:48.309 --> 16:49.476
I mean unresolved issues

16:49.510 --> 16:50.877
involving the black guy
in all these photographs.

16:50.911 --> 16:53.380
- Troy?
- Hey, I don't know his name, man.

16:53.414 --> 16:56.449
I just know he's clearly
left some kind of vacuum.

16:56.484 --> 16:58.585
And screw you.
What did I have to do with mom?

16:58.619 --> 17:00.487
I was 13.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.522
[Door opens, closes]

17:06.260 --> 17:08.027
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.762
I'm here to do my third-act apology.

17:09.797 --> 17:10.829
- Abed, I don't think...
- Wait.

17:10.865 --> 17:13.098
Don't reject it
until the whole thing's been served up.

17:13.134 --> 17:15.300
Dobry.

17:15.336 --> 17:18.305
Open your locker please.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.876
[Sighs]

17:22.910 --> 17:25.011
[Knocks on locker]

17:25.046 --> 17:27.347
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.783
- I wanna tell you something.
- Abed, this is adorable.

17:29.817 --> 17:32.217
Just because it's adorable
doesn't mean it's not important.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.421
Listen.

17:34.455 --> 17:35.822
I've been accelerating
our relationship

17:35.856 --> 17:38.358
because I've been worried
I wouldn't pass a lot of the tests.

17:38.392 --> 17:39.693
I wanted you to move in
because I thought

17:39.727 --> 17:42.262
if Annie was around, I'd have
less chance of screwing things up.

17:42.296 --> 17:44.397
You're not
screwing things up, though.

17:44.432 --> 17:46.266
That's good to know.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.934
But the problem with me
will always be

17:47.968 --> 17:49.602
that I can never know for sure.

17:49.637 --> 17:50.770
There's not a huge amount
of people in my life

17:50.805 --> 17:52.285
that haven't
eventually kicked me out,

17:52.306 --> 17:56.276
and I don't always see it coming.

17:56.310 --> 17:57.844
I don't want it to happen with you.

17:57.878 --> 18:00.480
Well, don't manipulate me
and don't keep secrets from me

18:00.514 --> 18:02.782
and we'll probably be okay.

18:02.817 --> 18:04.350
Cool.

18:04.385 --> 18:08.621
[Gasps]
It stopped raining.

18:08.656 --> 18:10.423
Yeah, it sure did.

18:10.458 --> 18:13.359
[Squeak]

18:13.394 --> 18:15.762
Aww, you hired a stunt person.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.957
No, I did not.

18:19.700 --> 18:20.867
Where'd you get these?

18:20.901 --> 18:23.536
They were an inheritance
from my father.

18:23.571 --> 18:26.239
- He was a collector.
- Mmhmm.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.475
- How many?
- 120.

18:28.509 --> 18:30.777
Well, for the whole bunch,
maybe 20.

18:30.811 --> 18:31.878
- Thousand?
- Dollars.

18:31.912 --> 18:33.646
- $20,000?
- 20 non-thousand dollars.

18:33.681 --> 18:34.881
20 regular dollars.

18:34.915 --> 18:36.716
You might get that
from a recycling place.

18:36.751 --> 18:39.953
These are misprints, honey.
Check out page 105.

18:39.987 --> 18:42.155
Well, I can't
because there's no page numbers.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.990
Ah! Well, that would be a problem.

18:44.025 --> 18:45.825
You know, "Class, turn to page..."

18:45.860 --> 18:47.293
There is no page...

18:47.328 --> 18:49.662
Oh, well, if there's no page number,
you can't turn to it.

18:49.697 --> 18:51.931
I've better things
to do with my life.

19:07.919 --> 19:09.359
Although we haven't been saying it,

19:09.383 --> 19:12.018
Troy was an important part
of our apartment.

19:12.053 --> 19:14.921
- He kept the peace.
- Yeah.

19:14.955 --> 19:17.190
Goin' a little crazy without him.

19:17.224 --> 19:20.226
Maybe we need to live
with a therapist.

19:20.261 --> 19:22.262
Or at least someone crazier
than us.

19:22.296 --> 19:25.265
[Footfall]

19:29.648 --> 19:32.105
- Let's give Craigslist another try.
- I think Craigslist is the way to go.

19:32.139 --> 19:33.500
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Yeah.

19:33.507 --> 19:36.409
Are you guys all wearing
the same clothes from yesterday?

19:36.444 --> 19:37.644
We've been through some stuff.

19:37.678 --> 19:39.079
But we learned something.

19:39.113 --> 19:40.447
No, we didn't.

19:40.481 --> 19:42.749
We learned that sometimes
there's no lesson.

19:42.783 --> 19:44.585
- How is that learning?
- We played Pile of Bullets.

19:44.695 --> 19:46.186
Can we just get
this meeting over with?

19:46.220 --> 19:48.321
- So how'd the cleanup go?
- I learned how to smile.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.956
Don't step, don't step to me.

19:49.990 --> 19:52.525
I like coffee and water,
don't step to me.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.995
Uh, damn it! I lost it.
I lost it!

19:56.705 --> 20:00.574
Okay. I will get back to you.
Thanks.

20:00.608 --> 20:02.401
- Who was that, sweetie?
- Guess they want me

20:02.478 --> 20:06.513
for that Wild West videotape
board game thing.

20:06.548 --> 20:08.048
- Pile of Bullets?
- Yeah.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.584
[Plate shatters]

20:10.619 --> 20:12.220
Devin, you pick up that phone
right now

20:12.254 --> 20:14.655
and you call these people
and you tell 'em you want this part.

20:14.689 --> 20:19.059
These VCR games
is where everything is headed.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.361
Can't you see that?

20:20.395 --> 20:24.198
You just became the Luke Skywalker

20:24.232 --> 20:25.599
of the new Star Wars.

20:25.634 --> 20:27.334
- We've gotta move.
- We do?

20:27.369 --> 20:28.569
Oh, yes, indeedy.

20:28.603 --> 20:31.071
We have got to move
to Los Angeles.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.573
But I work here.

20:32.607 --> 20:33.640
Oh, please.

20:33.675 --> 20:35.743
You call Apple computers work?

20:35.777 --> 20:38.312
What kind of company
offers stock options

20:38.346 --> 20:39.747
as a Christmas bonus?

20:39.781 --> 20:43.317
That ship is sinkin'.

20:43.351 --> 20:45.386
Sweetie, remember
when we were talkin'

20:45.420 --> 20:46.954
about trying cocaine?

20:46.988 --> 20:48.355
Yeah...

20:48.390 --> 20:51.859
I think we should start
looking for some right now.

20:51.893 --> 20:54.695
Because we're gonna be able
to afford it.

20:54.729 --> 20:57.097
Okay. I mean, if you're sure.

20:57.132 --> 21:00.301
I've never been more sure
about anything in my entire life.

21:00.335 --> 21:02.878
Pile of Bullets.

21:03.113 --> 21:05.017
