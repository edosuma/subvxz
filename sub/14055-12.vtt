00:01.956 --> 00:03.156
Previously on The O.C...

00:03.235 --> 00:04.836
Do you have another shirt I can borrow?

00:04.876 --> 00:06.196
I've had just about enough out of you.

00:06.276 --> 00:07.516
That's too bad 'cause
I'm just getting started.

00:10.396 --> 00:11.236
You almost kissed Cohen?

00:11.276 --> 00:12.476
It was not an almost kiss.

00:12.636 --> 00:14.076
It was a nose graze.

00:14.156 --> 00:15.476
I just talked to the guy at Wildstorm.

00:15.556 --> 00:17.316
I set up a meeting.
We're going to San Diego.

00:17.436 --> 00:20.196
Sandy, I've got
a couple of strokes

00:20.236 --> 00:21.036
Rebecca Bloom

00:21.196 --> 00:22.476
- You're still in love with her.
- She's dead.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.876
How'd she take the news about my return?

00:23.996 --> 00:25.036
I haven't told her yet.

00:25.116 --> 00:26.916
I don't want her to be
considered an accomplice.

00:26.996 --> 00:28.316
Sandy, is that you?

00:29.716 --> 00:30.556
Rebecca?

00:38.236 --> 00:39.996
Ryan, I had no idea you felt this way.

00:40.196 --> 00:41.756
Don't look at me,
they were here when I came in.

00:43.276 --> 00:45.916
Hey, you do realize Valentine's Day
is tomorrow, right?

00:45.996 --> 00:47.836
Yeah, well, we're starting
a little earlier this year.

00:47.956 --> 00:50.236
Your mother deserves
an extra long holiday

00:50.316 --> 00:51.956
with your grandfather in the hospital.

00:51.956 --> 00:54.636
And with you burning
the midnight oil as much as you have.

00:55.316 --> 00:56.436
Why don't you guys give me a hand, huh?

00:56.516 --> 00:57.756
The rest of the flowers
are out in the car.

00:57.916 --> 00:58.916
You've got more flowers?

00:59.836 --> 01:01.516
There's such a thing as overkill.

01:02.276 --> 01:04.396
Man, your parents are pretty
hard core about Valentine's Day.

01:05.075 --> 01:07.036
I just hope I survive
this hateful holiday.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.356
Mm, still broken up
over the Alex breakup?

01:09.516 --> 01:13.036
Nope, it's emotional child's play compared
to what we're dealing with now, Ryan.

01:13.556 --> 01:14.836
Summer's back.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.196
Yeah, and I don't want it
to be, believe me.

01:18.356 --> 01:20.076
But apparently the universe
has other plans for us.

01:20.196 --> 01:21.916
The universe is involved now.

01:22.156 --> 01:25.956
Why else would I be forced to go to San
Diego with her on the one-year anniversary

01:25.956 --> 01:29.596
of our sexual tête-à-tête
or pas de deux, if you will.

01:29.636 --> 01:31.156
As long as it's not a menage a trois,

01:31.156 --> 01:34.076
since you will be going to San Diego
with Zach, her boyfriend.

01:34.116 --> 01:35.236
Yeah, and my friend.

01:35.316 --> 01:37.596
Dude, I don't want to go
to San Diego, okay?

01:37.756 --> 01:38.836
I don't want to go
anywhere near Summer.

01:38.876 --> 01:40.236
Yeah, but the, uh, the universe.

01:40.356 --> 01:41.636
Yeah, exactly.

01:41.996 --> 01:43.516
Well, shouldn't be a problem for you.

01:43.596 --> 01:45.636
I mean, you and Summer
been friends for a while now, right?

01:46.396 --> 01:50.276
Yes, and I'd be a little more confident
about my chances of cheating fate and

01:50.276 --> 01:53.876
not cheating,
if Summer and I hadn't made out.

01:54.316 --> 01:55.036
You guys made out?

01:55.116 --> 01:57.036
No. But our noses grazed

01:57.196 --> 02:00.636
and it was like the most
sexually-charged nose graze

02:00.716 --> 02:02.076
in the history of nose grazes.

02:02.236 --> 02:04.356
It's essentially nose
humping is what it is.

02:04.436 --> 02:05.956
So what am I going to do?

02:06.316 --> 02:07.356
I'm going to tell you
what you're going to do.

02:07.636 --> 02:08.596
You're going to go down to San Diego

02:08.596 --> 02:10.996
with your friend Summer and
her boyfriend-- your friend-- Zach,

02:11.156 --> 02:14.836
and you're going to keep it in yourtrousers,
all right? Nothing can happen, got it?

02:14.956 --> 02:15.596
Yeah

02:15.676 --> 02:18.396
- I have no heart, I hate Valentine's Day.
- And that's why you're my son.

02:18.516 --> 02:20.556
What about you, Ryan?
You have anything lined up for Lindsay?

02:20.636 --> 02:23.236
Uh, no, Lindsay and I are taking a break.
She's getting to know her dad.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.596
So for Valentine's Day
you're getting Lindsay grandpa.

02:25.716 --> 02:28.156
Yeah. That's bad, right?

02:28.276 --> 02:30.756
Dad, step in here, help a brother out.

02:30.836 --> 02:33.036
This guy's got mad
Valentine's Day skills, bitch.

02:33.036 --> 02:37.236
Word, son. I hope I've learned something
after 20 years with your dear mother.

02:37.476 --> 02:38.676
That's right, it's her favorite holiday

02:38.756 --> 02:42.276
Yeah, which means she's probably gearing
up for the Cupid routine right now

02:45.196 --> 02:47.076
Here's my Valentine.

03:51.914 --> 03:53.554
I think I know what this is about

03:53.634 --> 03:55.034
and I can explain.

03:56.034 --> 03:57.354
You lied to me, Sandy.

03:58.474 --> 04:00.354
- No, I didn't lie.
- You told me Rebecca was dead.

04:00.514 --> 04:01.954
When I told you that, I thought she was.

04:01.994 --> 04:04.154
I went to your office last night
and she was standing there.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.834
Oh. You saw her.

04:07.154 --> 04:08.994
And then I came home,
you and I had dinner

04:09.154 --> 04:11.114
and nothing, you didn't say a word.

04:11.234 --> 04:13.234
She's accused of a very serious crime.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.314
Anything I would tell you about her
could make you an accessory.

04:16.394 --> 04:18.154
Don't try to get off
on a technicality.

04:18.194 --> 04:20.793
This is about our marriage.
You and I come first.

04:20.874 --> 04:23.074
I did what I thought I had to do.

04:23.434 --> 04:25.794
She's innocent.
And she's my client.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.554
She's not just your client.

04:27.554 --> 04:30.354
You were in love with her. Don't pretend
this isn't complicated for you.

04:30.514 --> 04:32.314
You're damn right it's complicated.

04:35.994 --> 04:36.994
Look...

04:38.554 --> 04:40.034
There's nothing going on between us.

04:41.034 --> 04:44.114
Please, let's not fight.
Tomorrow's Valentine's Day.

05:00.394 --> 05:01.874
Happy day before Valentine's Day.

05:04.674 --> 05:05.234
Okay...

05:05.674 --> 05:08.674
Uh, you said that we should
take a break.

05:08.674 --> 05:11.874
In relationship speak,
they call this mixed signals.

05:11.874 --> 05:15.954
I know, but it didn't really occur to me at
the time that Valentine's Day was coming up.

05:16.034 --> 05:18.954
You  don't want to be alone
on Valentine's Day.

05:19.034 --> 05:20.954
Aw, you are such a girl.

05:21.074 --> 05:22.434
So what do you think?

05:22.514 --> 05:24.474
You want to take some time off
from taking time off?

05:24.834 --> 05:25.314
Sure.

05:25.874 --> 05:28.834
- If... you do something for me.
- Yeah, name it. Anything.

05:30.234 --> 05:32.114
- Apologize to Caleb.
- Except that.

05:32.274 --> 05:34.154
I'm not saying it's your fault.

05:34.154 --> 05:37.034
I'm just going to be spending time over
there while he's recuperating

05:37.114 --> 05:41.434
and if you two are at each other's throats, it's
going to be really uncomfortable for everyone.

05:41.554 --> 05:45.354
So  if I apologize, I get to take you
out for Valentine's Day?

05:47.034 --> 05:49.674
Me and Cal. Happy to do it.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.354
Zach?

05:57.434 --> 05:58.994
Hey, Cohen, you're early.

05:59.354 --> 06:00.994
Yeah, I just wanted to, um,

06:01.034 --> 06:05.554
stop by and check in before Zach
got here and sort of touch base.

06:05.634 --> 06:06.994
Something you want to talk about?

06:07.394 --> 06:08.794
Something you want to talk about?

06:08.794 --> 06:09.834
- Huh?
- What?

06:09.874 --> 06:10.834
You came here.

06:10.834 --> 06:11.914
Yeah, no, I know.

06:11.914 --> 06:15.634
I, uh... I just wanted
to make sure that

06:15.714 --> 06:18.034
you're dressing warmly.
And you are, so, great.

06:18.114 --> 06:21.074
You know, actually, there is
something I want to ask you.

06:23.474 --> 06:25.274
Are these earrings too bling
for a meeting?

06:25.354 --> 06:26.474
I don't want to come off trashy.

06:26.514 --> 06:28.554
No, I think they're fine.

06:29.154 --> 06:32.434
Listen, Summer.
I know that the three of us sometimes,

06:32.434 --> 06:35.194
working together can get pretty weird.

06:35.394 --> 06:39.874
So I just... I have to say that if it
ever maybe gets to be too much for you...

06:39.954 --> 06:42.314
Hey, broken record. I'm fine.

06:42.434 --> 06:44.474
I just want us
to kick ass on our pitch.

06:44.554 --> 06:46.314
I really care about
this comic book.

06:47.114 --> 06:48.994
What, is that so hard to believe?

06:50.874 --> 06:53.474
- You guys ready to hit the road?
- Hey, did you MapQuest the meeting?

06:53.594 --> 06:55.554
Yeah, I got directions, got snacks.

06:55.714 --> 06:56.794
He's gonna pack snacks.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.474
- The motor's running.
- All right. Shotgun!

06:59.354 --> 07:01.714
Come on, move it, Cohen.
San Diego is not driving to us.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.234
For God's sake,
the door is ten feet away.

07:09.234 --> 07:11.594
Must I be humiliated in this chair?

07:11.674 --> 07:13.034
Oh, Dad, just humor us.

07:13.114 --> 07:14.514
You can lose the chair
when you get home.

07:14.714 --> 07:15.714
Oh, that reminds me.

07:15.914 --> 07:17.914
I, uh, brought you a little care package.

07:18.234 --> 07:19.474
That's very thoughtful of you.

07:19.754 --> 07:22.834
-"Mad Libs"
-Oh, those were my favorite when I was a kid.

07:24.394 --> 07:26.914
Well, I hope you'll be around
long enough to teach me how to play.

07:27.754 --> 07:29.514
Julie's still gallivanting
around in Europe,

07:29.514 --> 07:32.514
which means I got that
big old house all to myself.

07:32.834 --> 07:36.874
- Well, what about Marissa?
- Marissa can't be bothered.

07:36.914 --> 07:40.034
She's too busy running around
with that tattooed new friend of hers.

07:40.154 --> 07:42.274
Well, if you're looking for company,

07:42.474 --> 07:44.674
I know that Ryan wanted
to stop by for a visit.

07:44.914 --> 07:46.514
Oh, I think I've seen
just about enough of him.

07:46.514 --> 07:49.314
Lindsay, why don't you go find
the chauffeur and see if he'll pull up.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.714
Sure.

07:54.594 --> 07:56.834
You and Lindsay seem
to be making strides.

07:57.034 --> 07:58.714
That's a lot of regret,
coming into her life so late.

07:58.754 --> 08:00.074
You know how you can
make it up to her?

08:01.154 --> 08:02.274
Make things right with Ryan.

08:03.074 --> 08:04.794
What is it with my daughters
and that kid?

08:04.874 --> 08:06.754
- Dad.
- Fine, fine.

08:07.714 --> 08:11.074
Lindsay, can three people play Mad Libs?

08:11.194 --> 08:12.154
Sure, why?

08:12.794 --> 08:16.954
Well, I thought it might be quite nice
to invite Ryan over for a round.

08:16.994 --> 08:19.674
I understand he's handy
with an adverb.

08:20.754 --> 08:22.754
Yeah, I'll call him right now.

08:34.354 --> 08:37.193
Ugh, well, Olson's making records nows ?

08:37.354 --> 08:39.034
-Oh, no, you don't like it?
- No.

08:39.554 --> 08:42.034
Careful, man, if she doesn't like
your music she'll drive you off the road.

08:42.114 --> 08:44.034
Hey! Cohen, that was so your fault.

08:44.034 --> 08:46.634
Last year, he drove us into a ditch
on our way to Tijuana.

08:46.714 --> 08:47.914
You guys did the TJ thing?

08:47.954 --> 08:50.314
Actually we did the pit-stop-on-
the-way-to-TJ thing also.

08:50.354 --> 08:53.314
God, we had to spend this night
in this sleazy-ass hell hole.

08:53.434 --> 08:54.914
Seriously, it was like
Hepatitis Central.

08:54.994 --> 08:56.554
Okay, it wasn't that bad.

08:56.594 --> 08:59.874
Hello? Cohen... The bed was, like, covered
with all these tiny little curly hairs.

08:59.914 --> 09:04.074
Oh, really? Well, I seem to remember
you begging me for a spot on that bed.

09:04.074 --> 09:05.114
So who won?

09:05.994 --> 09:07.234
Who got the bed?

09:08.874 --> 09:12.234
Uh... I thinkwe worked it out..
I don't know that there was... yeah.
/ I don't really remember

09:12.754 --> 09:13.594
Thank you.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.594
I'm home

09:16.994 --> 09:18.234
Anyone here?

09:19.554 --> 09:20.834
Hello...?

09:24.834 --> 09:26.194
I'm home.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.554
How's the ticker?

09:28.674 --> 09:31.634
Ticking, thankfully.
I wasn't expecting you today.

09:31.794 --> 09:35.354
I canceled my trip to Nice so I could
come home and keep you company.

09:37.554 --> 09:40.394
But I see you're already
doing fine in that department.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.714
- Hi, Julie.
- Lindsay, hello.

09:42.794 --> 09:45.634
Lindsay's making us some lunch.
Tuna sandwiches.

09:45.634 --> 09:46.674
Want one?

09:47.514 --> 09:48.994
I'll pass, thanks.

09:49.114 --> 09:53.074
But it's nice to see you two have grown
so close since I've been gone.

09:53.234 --> 09:55.994
Well, Ju-Ju, Lindsay and I are
in the midst of some Mad Libs.

09:56.154 --> 09:57.994
I'm sure you want to go
freshen up.

09:58.154 --> 09:59.394
Fine. I can take a hint.

10:00.314 --> 10:04.394
Well,  make yourself at home.
Caleb's casa es su casa.

10:04.794 --> 10:06.874
Okay, plural noun.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.234
Marissa?

10:09.874 --> 10:12.114
Oh, honey,
it's 1:00 in the afternoon.

10:12.634 --> 10:14.434
Get out, Mom, I'm sleeping.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.754
You and your stepfather
are quite the welcome wagon.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.434
Do you want something?

10:23.154 --> 10:24.674
Just to say hello to my daughter.

10:25.034 --> 10:26.354
And to give you this.

10:26.954 --> 10:31.034
It's a Chanel clutch. Every girl I saw
in Paris was carrying one of these.

10:31.074 --> 10:32.914
Thanks, you can leave it
on the dresser.

10:37.434 --> 10:38.554
Marissa.

10:39.354 --> 10:45.314
You know, when I was in Europe
I did some real soul searching.

10:45.874 --> 10:49.514
- I hope you didn't hurt yourself.
- I'm trying to talk to you.

10:50.474 --> 10:52.594
Look, I know that
you've been angry with me.

10:52.674 --> 10:54.674
- What gives you that idea?
- And you have your reasons.

10:54.714 --> 10:57.394
I just think that it's time
to put those memories behind us.

10:57.634 --> 11:00.834
It's time we became friends again.
Let's go to dinner, just the two of us.

11:01.554 --> 11:03.714
Thanks, Mom, but I'm not that lame.

11:07.794 --> 11:09.874
What if I took away
your BlackBerry?

11:10.474 --> 11:11.714
And your cell phone.

11:12.514 --> 11:15.514
- You can't take away my cell phone.
- Oh, I think I just did.

11:15.554 --> 11:19.314
Are you going to throw the bedroom
furniture in the pool now? That's great.

11:19.354 --> 11:22.634
You want to become friends
so you're blackmailing me.

11:22.794 --> 11:25.834
That's a great plan, Mom.
I'll see you at dinner.

11:55.074 --> 11:57.434
- Oh. Oh, not bad.
- Well, it beats living in my office.

11:57.514 --> 12:02.114
Your office was fine. It was the running
into Kirsten part that was rough.

12:02.554 --> 12:03.794
She must be furious.

12:04.034 --> 12:07.034
Well, there was some poor roses
that took the brunt of it this morning.

12:07.114 --> 12:10.234
I know I've complicated
your life lately...

12:10.794 --> 12:14.034
and to thank you, I got you
a little Valentine's gift.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.234
When I saw it, I couldn't resist.

12:20.954 --> 12:26.994
Gandhi. Every time I see this, I think of you
snoring right next to me in that theater.

12:27.034 --> 12:28.154
I couldn't help it-- it's a long movie.

12:28.154 --> 12:30.594
It was our first date.
You could've stayed awake.

12:30.634 --> 12:33.194
- Well, it was a lousy first-date movie.
- You're right.

12:38.394 --> 12:40.074
Okay, I know that look.

12:41.074 --> 12:42.594
You want to talk.

12:42.954 --> 12:44.874
Oh, here's the thing.

12:47.074 --> 12:48.994
I don't know if I'm
the best lawyer for you.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.994
You know, I'm not that well schooled
in amnesty cases.

12:50.994 --> 12:53.034
And it might put a strain
on your marriage.

12:53.114 --> 12:55.674
- That, too.
- Okay.

12:55.914 --> 12:58.234
I know you want to put this thing
behind you-- I want it over, too.

12:58.434 --> 13:02.394
But you and I spending day after day
poring over my case,

13:02.714 --> 13:05.034
our meetings stretching
into the wee hours.

13:05.554 --> 13:08.794
There are days I think
Kirsten and me are bulletproof.

13:10.594 --> 13:12.594
I don't want to test that theory.

13:13.154 --> 13:14.914
I should've seen this coming.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.994
One thing I know about you, Sandy Cohen:
you always do the right thing.

13:17.994 --> 13:21.114
I'm gonna get you a list
of the best lawyers in town.

13:21.874 --> 13:23.234
You're gonna get through this.

13:23.674 --> 13:25.634
I wish I was getting
through this with you.

13:28.394 --> 13:32.954
Well..
be careful what you wish for.

13:47.854 --> 13:49.494
Hey, there.

13:51.934 --> 13:53.734
How's your father doing?

13:54.014 --> 13:55.094
He's okay.

13:55.774 --> 13:57.974
- And you?
- About the same.

13:59.534 --> 14:03.574
Credit card company called to verify
that you're staying at the Beachcomber?

14:04.494 --> 14:07.454
It's for Rebecca. So she doesn't have
to stay at my office.

14:09.134 --> 14:11.614
I know you're being put
in the middle of this,

14:11.654 --> 14:14.814
but if you want to take her case,
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

14:15.014 --> 14:15.934
I'm not gonna be her lawyer.

14:15.934 --> 14:18.054
- Don't. Not because of me.
- Of course it's because of you.

14:18.174 --> 14:21.174
I know enough not to mess
with my wife on Valentine's Day.

14:21.254 --> 14:23.734
- Sandy.
- You didn't force me to do anything.

14:24.774 --> 14:27.694
Well, maybe this is selfish of me,
but I have to say I'm happy.

14:27.774 --> 14:28.774
Good.

14:30.614 --> 14:32.934
There's one thing
you could do for me.

14:33.054 --> 14:36.014
Please find a restaurant that still has
a reservation open for tomorrow night.

14:36.094 --> 14:39.534
- I don't want to eat takeout on Valentine's Day.
- What are you in the mood for?

14:39.534 --> 14:44.854
Oh... something with a view of the ocean...
and an overpriced prix fixe menu.

14:44.894 --> 14:46.574
- Sounds like The Arches.
- Perfect.

14:46.654 --> 14:47.854
I'll call them right now.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.694
Hey, this is the last of these,
so should we make more copies?

14:57.774 --> 15:00.374
You know, you don't have to hang
around here all day to help me.

15:00.454 --> 15:02.734
Please. Any excuse to avoid my house.

15:03.054 --> 15:06.334
My mom's been home for, like, three
hours, and already I'm going insane.

15:06.414 --> 15:08.374
My mom used
to drive me crazy, too,

15:08.374 --> 15:10.934
and then one day I just decided I was
not gonna let it bother me anymore.

15:10.974 --> 15:12.214
You make it sound so easy.

15:12.374 --> 15:16.174
No, every time my mom channels Satan,
I take a deep breath, count to three,

15:16.214 --> 15:18.654
give her a big smile,
and say something like,

15:18.694 --> 15:20.894
"Interesting idea, Mom--
I'll give that some thought."

15:21.014 --> 15:21.934
And that really works?

15:22.014 --> 15:24.894
Women like that,
they thrive on confrontation,

15:24.934 --> 15:27.614
but if you refuse to engage, then there's
not really anything they can do,

15:27.654 --> 15:29.414
which makes them go
even more out of their heads.

15:29.414 --> 15:31.894
Wow, sounds like a fun way
to spend an evening.

15:33.214 --> 15:36.934
But, you know, anyone who can make
my mom even crazier gets a free dinner.

15:37.334 --> 15:38.534
So what do you say?

15:39.814 --> 15:40.814
Okay.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.614
But not tomorrow night. I don't do
Valentine's Day first dates

15:44.654 --> 15:47.014
I think it's a jinx.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.054
But next week...

15:50.734 --> 15:53.734
...when we don't have Hallmark
breathing down our necks,

15:53.854 --> 15:56.534
we'll go on a date. Cool?

15:56.814 --> 15:57.974
Cool.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.574
Okay, so...
let's go over this again.

16:05.454 --> 16:08.094
I'll do the introduction.
Seth, you do the character arcs.

16:08.174 --> 16:12.374
Zach...  you just need to relax a little
bit, man. I promise you have this.

16:12.494 --> 16:14.694
You know what?
My teeth are all plaquey.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.094
I'm going to go do a last-minute floss.

16:19.894 --> 16:24.694
God... she is so OCD, man. Backpacking
with heris gonna be a nightmare.

16:25.134 --> 16:26.654
You guys are going backpacking?

16:26.654 --> 16:28.934
Yeah. My sister is getting
married in Tuscany.

16:28.934 --> 16:32.334
- Summer's gonna be my date.
- Tuscany, like Italy?

16:32.414 --> 16:35.734
Yeah. My family's renting a villa. But
we're just gonna stay for the wedding,

16:35.854 --> 16:37.014
and then
we're gonna go off on our own.

16:37.014 --> 16:40.094
You know, backpack through Cinque Terre,
maybe a weekend in Venice.

16:40.414 --> 16:43.454
Wow! Doesn't sound... romantic at all.

16:44.054 --> 16:46.254
Hey, are you guys here
to pitch to Mr. Bernstein?

16:46.334 --> 16:47.134
Yes, we are.

16:47.294 --> 16:49.934
He can't see you till tomorrow.
He got delayed coming back from Japan.

16:50.014 --> 16:51.854
- What?
- They're gonna get you rooms in town

16:51.894 --> 16:55.174
and I'll reschedule you for first
thing tomorrow, okay? ...Wildstorm.

16:55.174 --> 16:57.774
Well, at least we'll have an extra night
to work on the pitch, huh, Seth?

16:58.174 --> 17:02.974
Yeah. So just Cinque Terre and Venice or
maybe, like, Florence, too, or something?

17:02.974 --> 17:04.334
You are dreading this, aren't you?

17:04.614 --> 17:07.534
Pretty much. I'm sorry.
Can you blame me?

17:07.934 --> 17:10.414
All right, look, it's like the dentist.

17:10.694 --> 17:12.854
Think of how much better
you'll feel when it's over.

17:13.814 --> 17:15.214
Go on, I'll wait here.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.574
Hey, Mr. Nichol.

17:21.094 --> 17:22.773
Came by to say hello.

17:23.013 --> 17:24.094
Call me Caleb.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.614
- So, you play pool.
- No. My first time.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.534
Okay, I came by to apologize.

17:36.534 --> 17:39.174
I'm sorry... if I had anything to do
with your heart attack.

17:39.334 --> 17:44.054
Thank you, Ryan. I realize it wasn't easy
for you to string so many words together.

17:44.534 --> 17:45.174
Excuse me?

17:45.174 --> 17:48.254
I'm merely noting
how rarely I hear you talk.

17:49.614 --> 17:52.214
- I guess I don't have much to say to you.
- Well, how about thank you?

17:52.334 --> 17:54.534
For the fine education you're getting,
the roof over your head,

17:54.534 --> 17:55.614
everything else I've done.

17:55.654 --> 17:57.574
Like insulting me,
treating me like a criminal?

17:57.614 --> 18:01.534
Well, you are a criminal. My do-gooder
son-in-law dragged you out of jail

18:01.574 --> 18:04.094
and installed you
in his pool house, remember?

18:04.574 --> 18:07.174
You know, Mr. Nichol, I don't
know why I try to talk to you.

18:08.574 --> 18:10.174
It's just a waste of time.

18:18.894 --> 18:21.534
So... how'd it go?

18:21.574 --> 18:23.414
There's always next Valentine's Day.

18:37.014 --> 18:38.894
Oh. One bed, huh?

18:39.694 --> 18:42.094
Looks like Zach and I
are getting cozy tonight.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.374
Cohen, we got adjoining rooms, man;
you're in here.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.214
- We do? Really?
- Yeah.

18:50.974 --> 18:54.974
Oh, well, then, okay... One second, though.
If I'm in here, that means that...

18:55.654 --> 18:57.454
Then what, you-you guys
would be in here?

18:59.014 --> 19:00.854
Yeah. Is that okay?

19:01.174 --> 19:03.694
Well, sure, yeah.
I mean... well, it makes sense.

19:04.694 --> 19:06.974
Yeah, that's fine, that's great.
That's actually perfect.

19:07.054 --> 19:10.454
Um, so, then... I take it you two
will be in here... uh, in there,

19:10.454 --> 19:13.454
actually, uh, uh,
together, and I will be...

19:14.054 --> 19:16.494
just on the other side of this...
sound-soundproof wall.

19:16.494 --> 19:18.414
Hey. You okay?
-Yeah

19:18.414 --> 19:23.574
no, I'm fine. I'm just having an
allergic... reaction to... the universe.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.054
Here you go.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.134
I got your coffee.

19:38.134 --> 19:41.094
Oh, thanks, Sandy, but I...
I've given up on that stuff.

19:41.734 --> 19:45.814
I never thought I'd see the day. You used
to average a pot an hour as I recall.

19:46.014 --> 19:51.694
Yeah. That's probably why I never slept.
That and... you keeping me up all hours,

19:51.734 --> 19:53.974
bending my ear with
your right-wing conspiracies.

19:53.974 --> 19:55.254
Who else was gonna listen to me?

19:55.294 --> 19:59.734
See, I assumed that you were
prepping me for father-in-law duty,

20:00.614 --> 20:02.174
and... then everything changed.

20:07.814 --> 20:11.294
- I feel like I'm jumping ship here, Max.
- No, no, no, no, you're not.

20:11.654 --> 20:16.854
I mean, your conscience, Sanford...
I mean, it's always worked in overdrive.

20:17.894 --> 20:20.134
No. Leaving you and Rebecca
just when we found her.

20:20.694 --> 20:22.694
The-the rest will work itself out.

20:26.574 --> 20:28.214
If you're not drinking coffee,
what are you drinking?

20:28.214 --> 20:31.654
Green tea.
Supposedly it's a detoxifier...

20:32.534 --> 20:37.614
Who knows, maybe if I started it earlier,
I, uh... I would've held up better.

20:38.374 --> 20:40.534
I'll go get you some.
There's a cafe right down the pier.

20:40.574 --> 20:43.174
- I'll be back in a sec.
- Okay, thanks, Sandy.

20:54.614 --> 20:58.454
You know what, we should turn in early.
We've got the pitch at the crack of dawn.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.294
Why don't we watch another movie.

21:00.614 --> 21:02.654
I think Van Helsing is on pay-per-view.

21:02.734 --> 21:04.654
I like monsters. Don't know
about the rest of you.

21:04.734 --> 21:06.054
- I'm pretty tired.
- Me, too.

21:06.574 --> 21:07.774
Well, then why don't we go
to the gift shop

21:07.814 --> 21:10.454
and see maybe if they have cards,
'cause then we could play gin

21:10.454 --> 21:12.614
or I could do some sleight
of hand for you guys.

21:12.654 --> 21:17.614
- Cohen... go to bed.
- Yes, okay

21:17.814 --> 21:21.614
But listen, I'm gonna be in here if
you guys need me or anything.

21:30.094 --> 21:33.374
Psst. Maybe we should invent a secret
knock, just in case, for whatever.

21:35.374 --> 21:36.694
Good night, Cohen.

21:44.974 --> 21:46.694
That's the knock we use

21:47.054 --> 21:47.494
Hey, Max, hey,

21:47.854 --> 21:50.694
they didn't have any green tea,
but I got you some jasmine.

21:51.414 --> 21:52.854
You... you drink jasmine?

21:56.094 --> 21:57.214
Hey, Max?

23:15.014 --> 23:17.214
There's no way there's three shots
of espresso in there.

23:17.214 --> 23:18.934
You look kind of spent, Seth.

23:18.974 --> 23:23.134
- Did you sleep at all?
- Yep. Got a solid 15 minutes.

23:23.454 --> 23:25.734
They say that's all you need.

23:26.454 --> 23:29.054
What about you guys? Probably
didn't sleep too well, huh?

23:29.174 --> 23:30.174
I slept fine, actually.

23:30.254 --> 23:32.934
Hi, guys. I'm Larry Bernstein.
Come on in.

23:33.294 --> 23:35.814
Okay, he's ready.
Showtime, come on, come on.

23:36.734 --> 23:40.814
Well, guys I read the treatment
and I think it's interesting.

23:40.894 --> 23:42.134
Good, great, glad to hear it.

23:42.294 --> 23:45.494
And on behalf of all of us, the three of us,
sitting three across in your office,

23:45.654 --> 23:48.854
uh, uh, thank you.
And we like your jacket.

23:49.294 --> 23:51.014
Uh, you're welcome and thank you.

23:51.214 --> 23:52.974
But putting pretty people by the beach

23:52.974 --> 23:55.774
isn't enough for me, even if they have
powers. So let's talk about characters.

23:55.774 --> 23:57.654
Great. Okay, first of all,
what can I tell you?

23:57.734 --> 23:59.574
We've got Kachino with his fists
of fury, okay?

23:59.574 --> 24:01.094
He's a kid, he's from the
wrong side of the tracks.

24:01.134 --> 24:05.534
Think Karate Kid, now take away the karate.
Let them marinate and we've got Cosmo Girl.

24:05.614 --> 24:08.014
She's got a passion for fashion
and a magic flask to boot.

24:08.134 --> 24:09.774
But what I want
to do right now, actually,

24:09.774 --> 24:12.774
is to take you to the white-hot
center of our comic, okay?

24:12.854 --> 24:15.574
The core relationship of really
what I think we're doing here.

24:15.574 --> 24:18.174
Now, what I'm talking about here
is passion. But real passion.

24:18.174 --> 24:21.214
Not the kind of passion you buy for $1.99
at the grocery store with a can of soup.

24:21.254 --> 24:23.014
- Cohen, what does that even mean?
- I have no idea.

24:23.094 --> 24:25.054
So you're saying there's a love story.

24:25.174 --> 24:26.054
- Yeah.
- No!

24:26.094 --> 24:28.054
Oh, no, no. Definitely not.

24:28.094 --> 24:30.414
Yeah, there is. Now, maybe you
can't see it and maybe you can't.

24:30.414 --> 24:33.294
But let me tell you something.
I promise you this. It's there.

24:33.334 --> 24:36.014
Amongst the demon water polo players
that arise from the toxic Pacific

24:36.094 --> 24:39.894
and attack Atomic County,
it's a love story for our time.

24:40.654 --> 24:43.934
- For all time.
- Mm-hmm. Between who?

24:44.014 --> 24:46.334
Yeah, Cohen, between who?

24:50.934 --> 24:54.254
Why, between the Ironist
and little Miss Vixen.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.134
What?

24:57.694 --> 24:59.134
The Ironist and little Miss Vixen.

24:59.294 --> 25:02.774
The Ironist, whose quick quips
and pop-culture-laden bromides

25:02.854 --> 25:05.654
can fell even the most
insidious of villains.

25:06.054 --> 25:09.334
Little Miss Vixen. So cute and so sweet
in her black leather.

25:09.374 --> 25:13.614
Her Amex card can decapitate a demon up to
100 yards away especially when she senses

25:13.694 --> 25:18.534
- her true love, the Ironist, is in danger.
- Well, this is an interesting approach.

25:18.534 --> 25:22.334
- Yes, but not one we've discussed.
- No, there is no love story.

25:22.414 --> 25:25.774
Not yet, there isn't. Okay, stop. Here's
the thing. And the thing is this, sir.

25:25.774 --> 25:30.974
If the Ironist and Little Miss Vixen
could put their differences aside

25:31.214 --> 25:34.574
for just one issue and stop their bickering
and stop their bantering

25:34.574 --> 25:36.654
-- even though the readers might
find it adorable--

25:37.654 --> 25:42.054
I really feel like they would realize how
much more evil they could vanquish together.

25:42.134 --> 25:43.614
No, Cohen, they can't.

25:45.334 --> 25:47.534
Um, look, we're really sorry, sir.

25:47.534 --> 25:51.134
This is not the comicthat
we wanted to pitch to you.

25:53.934 --> 25:57.854
Yes, well, it has some promise,
but you three are clearly not ready

25:57.854 --> 25:59.334
- to forge a partnership.
- Clearly.

25:59.494 --> 26:01.574
So get back to me...

26:02.334 --> 26:03.854
after high school.

26:19.014 --> 26:22.094
The coroner said he guessed
it was a stroke.

26:23.294 --> 26:24.774
He didn't suffer.

26:25.614 --> 26:28.014
- We can be grateful for that.
- I'm so sorry.

26:28.974 --> 26:31.174
- I know.
- And Rebecca?

26:31.374 --> 26:32.934
Well, she's doing her best.

26:33.654 --> 26:39.254
I'm sorry I didn't call till late
and stayed out till this morning.

26:39.334 --> 26:40.574
I understand.

26:41.454 --> 26:45.174
- I still want to go out tonight.
- Sandy, it's just Valentine's Day.

26:45.254 --> 26:49.014
- We can celebrate another time.
- No, I-I think we need this.

26:49.534 --> 26:54.174
I'm not used to things being so...
like they are right now, you know?

26:54.174 --> 26:59.494
- I... I don't like it.
- Me neither.

27:01.214 --> 27:04.574
I tell you what.
I'm going to go take a power nap

27:04.694 --> 27:10.414
and when I wake up, I want to see you
dolled up in your Valentine's finest.

27:27.414 --> 27:30.894
Hey. I thought we agreed we weren't
doing the Valentine's thing.

27:30.934 --> 27:32.494
I know. Just give me
one more chance with him.

27:32.494 --> 27:34.174
It'll only take a few hours.

27:35.814 --> 27:37.294
Oh, great. You're back.

27:37.694 --> 27:39.774
Can I talk to you for a second
in your study?

27:45.614 --> 27:48.654
Look, I'd say we need to talk,
but clearly that doesn't work for us.

27:49.494 --> 27:51.534
So what do you want to do,
take a swing at me?

27:51.734 --> 27:53.974
You might as well. I'm the only person
in town you haven't punched.

27:54.054 --> 27:56.854
I'll make you a bet.
We play pool.

27:57.094 --> 27:59.054
If you win, I stay out of your way,

27:59.054 --> 28:02.054
but if I win, you have to accept me
as Lindsay's boyfriend.

28:02.854 --> 28:04.614
What is this,
The Color Of Money?

28:04.814 --> 28:07.254
- It's absurd.
- Got a better idea?

28:09.254 --> 28:12.054
- Fine. Best of seven.
- Rack 'em.

28:15.814 --> 28:19.734
Well, what would you like
to talk about? Clothes, school?

28:19.814 --> 28:22.254
Why don't you cut to the chase?
Tell me what this is really about.

28:22.494 --> 28:25.334
It's not about anything, except
that I'm very happy to be here with you.

28:25.494 --> 28:28.094
Now that your father's gone and
Kaitlin's in boarding school,

28:28.094 --> 28:29.694
it's like we're all
that's left of the family

28:29.814 --> 28:31.734
and it just makes sense
for us to lean on each other.

28:31.734 --> 28:35.094
You act like you're all alone.
I mean, you have Caleb.

28:36.014 --> 28:40.054
You know, Marissa, I think you're old enough
now that I can be honest with you about this.

28:40.174 --> 28:43.534
I worry about Caleb and me,
that we might not make it.

28:43.534 --> 28:46.254
Come on, Mom. If you two can't
make it, no one can.

28:46.414 --> 28:49.574
The point is, whatever happens between
Caleb and me, I'll survive.

28:50.774 --> 28:53.574
What I could never handle
is losing you.

28:54.494 --> 28:58.054
Well, thanks.
I almost believe you.

28:58.214 --> 29:03.374
Oh, honey. You and me,
we need to play our cards right.

29:04.854 --> 29:06.214
What do you mean, "our cards"?

29:06.214 --> 29:08.054
Just that we spend our time
with Caleb wisely.

29:08.134 --> 29:10.614
I've already launched the
magazine, it's a good start.

29:10.654 --> 29:13.494
But I'd like to control a little more
of the company, just in case.

29:13.534 --> 29:17.094
If we can play happy family for just a few
more months, I can figure out my next move.

29:17.174 --> 29:20.494
- Oh, my God, Mom. You are unbelievable.
- What?

29:20.574 --> 29:23.094
Do you want your inheritance
going to little Miss Lindsay?

29:23.214 --> 29:24.774
Because that is where
this is headed

29:24.774 --> 29:28.334
unless you put in some serious
face time with your stepfather.

29:32.814 --> 29:36.134
That's an interesting idea, Mom.
I'll think about it.

29:36.814 --> 29:39.174
Now why don't you tell me
about your trip?

29:53.934 --> 29:58.014
Okay, Cohen, you want to explain
that meltdown before?

30:02.734 --> 30:07.454
Look, if there's something you want
to say to me, now's your chance.

30:15.174 --> 30:18.654
You know, I just think I'm gonna
lay off the caffeine forever.

30:18.934 --> 30:21.534
Fine. Don't say I didn't ask.

30:22.214 --> 30:23.414
You ready to hit the road?

30:23.534 --> 30:26.974
Yeah, you know, actually,
I think I'm just gonna take the bus.

30:27.094 --> 30:29.054
- The bus?
- Fine with me.

30:30.014 --> 30:34.414
You know, actually, if we're not going
to take Cohen home, we could stay here.

30:34.494 --> 30:36.094
We have the room
and it's Valentine's Day.

30:36.174 --> 30:40.454
Yeah, since you guys are going to Italy, you
can start getting used to the hotel life.

30:41.814 --> 30:46.494
Okay, headed to the bus depot.
Happy Valentine's Day.

30:59.934 --> 31:00.734
Hello?

31:00.774 --> 31:03.814
Oh, I expected to get your voicemail.
I thought you'd be out with your wife.

31:03.894 --> 31:06.294
No, we've got a late reservation.
We're just on our way out.

31:06.334 --> 31:11.094
Oh, okay I won't keep you.
I, um, I just, uh...

31:13.574 --> 31:15.974
I didn't want to disappear again
without saying good-bye.

31:16.054 --> 31:17.414
What are you talking about?

31:17.534 --> 31:18.774
I'm leaving.

31:18.774 --> 31:20.214
Don't try to talk me out of it.

31:20.214 --> 31:23.854
Let's be realistic.
My chances of getting off are slim.

31:24.094 --> 31:29.014
- Well, isn't it worth trying?
- Not if I don't have my father anymore.

31:30.214 --> 31:32.214
- So when are you leaving?
- Tonight.

31:34.214 --> 31:39.214
I guess there's no chance of you swinging
over here to say good-bye in person?

31:39.294 --> 31:40.814
Oh, I don't think so.

31:44.454 --> 31:47.014
- Let me get back to you.
- Okay.

31:50.614 --> 31:51.414
Rebecca?

31:51.614 --> 31:58.614
Yeah, she's, uh... she's leaving tonight.
Going back to God knows where.

31:59.294 --> 32:02.134
- She wants to say good-bye.
- Yeah.

32:04.894 --> 32:07.934
Well, if you want to go,
I'm not going to try and stop you.

32:19.174 --> 32:20.574
I'll be right back.

32:51.802 --> 32:54.362
I think we've actually
salvaged Valentine's Day.

32:55.362 --> 32:58.242
Even though Cohen did
his best to destroy it.

32:59.082 --> 33:01.522
I don't think he's ever
going to get over you.

33:01.722 --> 33:03.242
I've kind of accepted it.

33:04.082 --> 33:06.322
Look, Zach, those are
his issues, not mine.

33:06.322 --> 33:10.482
Good. Because all I really care
about is that you and I are okay.

33:10.682 --> 33:15.962
Look at us. We're in a hotel room
by ourselves on Valentine's Day.

33:16.002 --> 33:19.202
- I think we're okay.
- Good.

33:19.242 --> 33:24.522
I mean, we weren't even supposed to be here.
It's like fate handed us this dream date.

33:24.602 --> 33:28.762
So why don't we just make
the most of it?

33:33.322 --> 33:37.522
Um, Summer, before we do anything,
I need to tell you something.

33:43.282 --> 33:46.682
- Who is it?
- It doesn't matter.

34:14.562 --> 34:15.402
Your shot.

34:19.922 --> 34:22.002
- You don't seem worried.
- Should I be?

34:22.121 --> 34:25.722
- You're about to lose.
- I don't think so. You're a hothead, Ryan.

34:25.922 --> 34:29.282
- Pool takes a steady hand.
- Well, I've got a steady hand.

34:29.922 --> 34:31.762
Then why do you always
find yourself in trouble?

34:31.962 --> 34:34.282
Setting fires,
impregnating teenage girls...

34:34.482 --> 34:37.002
I know what you're trying to do.
It's not going to work.

34:40.522 --> 34:41.882
Come on, Ryan.

34:41.922 --> 34:45.562
It's all very chivalrous. This challenging
me to a duel for Lindsay's affection.

34:45.562 --> 34:48.802
But, you know, ultimately
she's gonna side with me.

34:49.442 --> 34:52.242
- I'm her father.
- Who abandoned her for 16 years.

34:53.601 --> 34:55.282
That's all in the past.

34:58.442 --> 35:00.242
I don't think Lindsay sees it that way.

35:15.522 --> 35:16.602
Corner.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.722
Well, this may be the way you
settle things where you come from.

35:33.842 --> 35:37.122
A game of pool, maybe a barstool
over someone's head,

35:37.442 --> 35:39.922
but in real life,
it takes more than that.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.562
Hey. Sorry, we're done.

35:46.402 --> 35:48.202
Good, I was starting
to worry about you guys.

35:48.602 --> 35:52.002
- Well, enjoy your date. It's on me.
- Thanks.

35:52.202 --> 35:53.802
So what do you want to do?

35:53.922 --> 35:56.362
Maybe go to Balboa Island,
milkshakes and bumper cars?

35:56.402 --> 35:58.442
You know what, why don't you guys
stay here tonight?

35:58.562 --> 36:01.882
- Are you sure? It's Valentine's Day.
- Yeah, well, tomorrow night.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.562
Okay. But have fun.
Maybe rent a movie or something.

36:05.682 --> 36:07.762
I hear The Color of Money
is pretty good.

36:22.242 --> 36:25.202
Hi, it's Kirsten Cohen.
I'd like to cancel a reservation.

36:25.562 --> 36:27.162
And what time was your reservation ?

36:27.362 --> 36:30.162
So you bailed on your wife
on Valentine's Day.

36:30.682 --> 36:32.602
That doesn't seem like
a Sandy Cohen move.

36:32.722 --> 36:34.162
It isn't.

36:34.722 --> 36:38.002
I wanted to say good-bye to you.
But now I've got to go.

36:38.082 --> 36:39.922
Oh, I think we've already missed dinner.

36:40.002 --> 36:41.882
So stay here.

36:44.202 --> 36:50.002
I've been without you for 20 years,
but still, I'm gonna miss you...

36:51.282 --> 36:52.722
all over again.

36:54.762 --> 36:58.442
Sandy, I... I wish
it had never happened.

36:58.562 --> 37:00.322
I wish I could take it
all back, that night.

37:00.402 --> 37:03.042
I wish I'd never run.

37:04.882 --> 37:06.122
Me, too.

37:29.882 --> 37:34.002
I got to go. But you should stay.

37:55.042 --> 38:00.002
Hey. Sorry I called you away
from your hot date.

38:00.002 --> 38:03.242
I'm sorry to hear your
Valentine's Day went so terrible.

38:03.282 --> 38:07.162
Terrible? Uh, no, no,
try catastrophic.

38:07.482 --> 38:12.722
I blew the comic book and I just completely
humiliated myself in front of Summer.

38:13.522 --> 38:16.962
After the way I acted today, Ryan, I don't
even think I'd get back together with me.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.562
Probably for the best.
I mean, with Zach and all.

38:19.642 --> 38:21.882
Hey, you know what?
Truth is, he deserves her.

38:22.202 --> 38:25.162
And clearly he's got the
universe on his side, so...

38:29.562 --> 38:32.042
Hey. I didn't know
you were coming by.

38:32.162 --> 38:36.242
Neither did I.
I guess I'm just sort of here.

38:36.602 --> 38:38.442
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

38:38.442 --> 38:42.322
I mean, I think I'm okay. I just had
a terrible dinner with my mom.

38:42.442 --> 38:44.482
- My technique work?
- Guess so.

38:46.762 --> 38:49.962
But also, it was knowing
I could come here and see you.

38:52.602 --> 38:56.202
Not that I want to put any
pressure on you or anything,

38:57.082 --> 39:01.922
it's just that's how I feel
and I had to say it.

39:06.162 --> 39:07.482
Are you in the mood for the beach?

39:07.882 --> 39:10.842
- Now?
- Yeah. It's almost time.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.842
- Time for what?
- For the tide to change.

39:13.002 --> 39:16.042
It's a little ritual I have for
whenever something really major

39:16.122 --> 39:18.442
is about to change in my life.

39:18.602 --> 39:21.002
I thought you said no dating
on Valentine's Day.

39:21.802 --> 39:22.842
Screw it.

39:24.802 --> 39:25.762
Come on.

39:26.122 --> 39:28.762
I'm a huge fan
of spontaneous first dates.

39:31.082 --> 39:32.602
I am, too.

40:13.882 --> 40:14.842
No, look...

40:14.962 --> 40:19.322
I'm not saying it's not bad. Hanging out
with my grandpa ranks very low

40:19.322 --> 40:22.762
on the Valentine's scale. I just, you
know, I think mine's worse, I win.

40:22.882 --> 40:24.202
You're right, yours is worse.

40:24.962 --> 40:26.322
Look at all these people.

40:26.882 --> 40:33.882
These normal, non-traumatized
people in relationships, in love.

40:35.442 --> 40:37.082
Think we'll ever have that?

40:38.002 --> 40:39.042
No.

40:39.322 --> 40:41.122
Yeah, I'm with you.

40:55.802 --> 40:57.682
The tide just turned.
