You have to help me get Jess.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.507
Did you hear me?
I need your help.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.679
Why on earth would
I ever help you?

00:12.721 --> 00:14.597
Hey, you're still here?

00:14.639 --> 00:16.474

It's Murphy.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.143
I'm ready to turn myself in.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.603
Uh-huh. And
what do you want?

00:20.645 --> 00:24.024
Jess. She was kidnapped,
and I need you to get her out.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.442
Who kidnapped her?

00:25.483 --> 00:26.818
This guy named Josiah.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.111
He took over Nia's business.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.821
Arrest him, too. I don't care.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.656
Just get her out.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.033
(whispering):
The drugs.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.243
That must be where
the cartel shipment went.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.662
We need to get the entire stash
to get the chief on board.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.205
Josh.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.623
Say something.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.125
Trust me, this isn't
gonna happen without it.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.460
I'm sorry. Just--
I need your help.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.128
Fine. Fine.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.629
We'll get Jess.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.089
But we'll also need the heroin.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.508
Every brick.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.182
Does Josiah keep the
drugs at the arcade?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.228
Yeah.

01:04.689 --> 01:06.399
You can have it.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.110
All of it is at Downtown Empire
Arcade on 35th Street.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.195
That's where Jess is, too.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.822
One more thing.
What?

01:12.864 --> 01:15.575
Look, we both know
that you didn't kill Nia alone.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.787
So I also want Felix Bell,
Max Parish

01:18.828 --> 01:20.622
and Jessica Damon.
(tutting) Josh.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.123

01:22.165 --> 01:24.125

your friends mean to you.

Deal?

01:33.176 --> 01:34.552

What...

01:34.594 --> 01:35.637
what is it?

01:35.678 --> 01:37.055
What's
he saying?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.473
I heard him
say my name.

Deal.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.665
I'll text you my number.

02:03.706 --> 02:06.626
Okay. Give me till the morning
to secure you a safe house.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.336
I'll send the details.

Josiah only gave us
until 9:00 p.m. tomorrow night.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.881
Well, as long as you surrender
before then,

02:11.923 --> 02:13.508
that won't be a problem.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.553
Okay.

to hang out.

a place without a warrant.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.282
That's literally the point
of a warrant.

09:34.323 --> 09:37.201

a couple loopholes.

Sutton and Fifth.

23:08.762 --> 23:11.556
Sutton and Fifth?

23:11.598 --> 23:13.725
Nobody buys there.
I won't make enough.

23:13.767 --> 23:17.813
I know. So I suggest
you rearrange your priorities...

23:19.856 --> 23:22.526
...if you'd like
to stick around here.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.986
Now, if you'll excuse me.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.165
Yo, check it out.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.335
The guy out front printed off
the arcade floor plan for me.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.754
Nice.
Okay.

23:42.796 --> 23:43.880
All right, look here.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.091
These stairs lead
to a basement.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.593
JOSH:
Which is probably where he's
keeping the drugs and Jess.

23:48.635 --> 23:51.263
Exactly. Now, if they walk
through the front door,

23:51.304 --> 23:53.515
they're first gonna go past
the snack area,

23:53.557 --> 23:58.562
where they sell all those nasty
hot dogs and things like that.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.689
Then they're gonna go past
the main arcade area.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.482
That's where they have
all their games

24:02.524 --> 24:04.401
and a few tables set up.

24:04.443 --> 24:08.363
It's about a hundred feet or so
until they get to the back...

24:08.405 --> 24:11.032
where the laser tag arena is.

24:11.074 --> 24:14.244
This is where it gets
a little tricky.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.539
It's essentially an obstacle
course back there.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.458
The whole place is designed
to make you feel like

24:19.499 --> 24:21.334
you don't know where
you're going.

24:21.376 --> 24:22.752
JOSH:
What are we gonna do
if Josiah has guys

24:22.794 --> 24:24.463
guarding those stairs?

24:24.504 --> 24:26.089
GENE:
No, dude,
I've been there before.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.966
It's a completely functioning
business.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.427
They don't have no guards,
no guns, no nothing.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.013
At least nothing that's visible.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.562
My best guess is,
Jess is in that room

24:40.604 --> 24:42.856
closest to the stairs.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.567
Where's Alex?
Please tell me where Alex is.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.235
Where's Alex?!
Please tell me where-- No!

24:47.277 --> 24:50.030
(bangs on door)
Come back!

24:50.071 --> 24:51.531
GENE:
Now we just got to hope
that she's still alive

24:51.573 --> 24:53.325
by the time we get there.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.548
You're insane.
I know.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.425
I didn't use a toilet seat
cover, leave me alone.

25:10.467 --> 25:14.304
No, sicko, it's just, I can't
believe that you got everyone

25:14.346 --> 25:16.723
to do this for me.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.476
Seriously?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.645
You think we'd just
let you die in there?

25:21.686 --> 25:24.773
Oh, my God.
(chuckles)

25:24.814 --> 25:27.234
I'm sorry.
No.

25:27.275 --> 25:30.278
I did. Well...
No, I did.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.657
I did think that.
Geez.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.242
(laughs)

25:37.202 --> 25:39.496
Do you think we're gonna
have, like, the same...

25:39.538 --> 25:42.749
prison... block?

25:42.791 --> 25:44.751
Room? What do you call it?
Bunk.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.419
Bunk?
I think.

25:46.461 --> 25:48.547
(exhales noisily)
I don't know.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.425
They're gonna eat us alive.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.724
You're, like, actually
looking forward to this?

25:59.766 --> 26:01.810
You think you're gonna have
some hot prison girlfriend?

26:01.851 --> 26:04.896
No.
Yeah, you do.

26:04.938 --> 26:08.275
Just, I guess I will
feel a lot safer there

26:08.316 --> 26:11.111
than I do right now.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.908
Well, then, you're welcome.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.034
I didn't say thank you.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.080
I've got to wash my hands.
Yes. You do.

26:29.170 --> 26:32.090
MURPHY:
Pretzel?

26:32.132 --> 26:33.592
Pretzel?

26:35.552 --> 26:37.220
Hi, buddy.

26:44.352 --> 26:46.896
How long have I been out?
MURPHY:
No idea.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.026
I'll be right back.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.611
Where are you going?

26:52.652 --> 26:55.697
I'm gonna go catch up with D.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.700
No, I need to get out
of my stupid head.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.118
You're talking to me.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.371
Please?

27:10.920 --> 27:12.505
Okay.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.678
What do you want
to talk about?

27:24.392 --> 27:26.061
I don't know.
Where'd you grow up?

27:26.102 --> 27:28.438
All over.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.524
Your parents moved a lot?
Nope.

27:31.566 --> 27:34.444
Uh, I moved a lot.

27:36.112 --> 27:37.697
Were you in the system
or something?

27:40.742 --> 27:44.120
Uh... yeah.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.083
Me, too.

27:52.712 --> 27:55.465
That makes sense why
you act the way you do.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.052
How do I act?

28:00.929 --> 28:05.183
You have this...
tough guy facade

28:05.225 --> 28:08.645
and, you know, you play tough.

28:08.687 --> 28:13.066
You're emotionally unavailable.
I bet the girls love it.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.943
Hmm. Maybe.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.249
(exhales noisily)

28:29.290 --> 28:30.959
Looks like you need
another one.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.711
Looks like you need
to slow down.

28:32.752 --> 28:36.840
This might be my last drinks
for a long time.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.717
Trying to soak it in.

28:40.510 --> 28:43.680
Excuse me, garçon, uh,
could we get another, please?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.307
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.

28:46.349 --> 28:51.271
These are your last moments
of freedom.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.981
Why are you sitting here
with me?

28:53.022 --> 28:55.316
Because we're bros.

28:55.358 --> 28:57.610
And where else am I
supposed to be?

28:57.652 --> 28:59.237
With Murphy.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.325
(chuckling):
Why would I be with Murphy?

29:04.367 --> 29:06.411
'Cause you're into her.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.457
I'm... what?

29:10.498 --> 29:14.669
(laughs):
I am not into...

29:14.711 --> 29:16.963
You got your wires
crossed, man.

29:17.005 --> 29:20.842
I am not... into Murphy.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.927
(laughs):
Okay.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.222
Are we friends?
Of course.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.766
Did sh-- Did we have sex?

29:27.807 --> 29:29.809
Sure. Sure we did.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.520
Did it feel oddly natural?
Uh-huh.

29:32.562 --> 29:35.815
Did she say she would do it
again if she was horny enough?

29:35.857 --> 29:37.275
Absolutely.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.575
(awkward chuckle)

29:47.202 --> 29:51.498
Yeah, you know what,
maybe I'll... just...

29:51.539 --> 29:52.707
Maybe I'll just go see
if she wants a drink.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.417
There you go.
(chuckles)

29:54.459 --> 29:56.920
There you go.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.408
What?
Don't worry.

33:13.449 --> 33:16.202
I'll go back and get it

34:04.542 --> 34:06.627

You did, right? Yeah, they did.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.757
Sorry, uh, is that a secret?

34:10.798 --> 34:13.259
I'm so sorry.
Felix, can you just
give us a second?

34:13.301 --> 34:15.386
(laughs)
Me? I--

34:15.428 --> 34:17.638
Yep, yep, you.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.640
You're the only
Felix in the car.

34:19.682 --> 34:22.268
Okay.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.564
(car door closes)
(Max groans)

34:26.606 --> 34:28.691
Sorry about him, he just...

34:28.733 --> 34:31.319
likes to talk
a lot.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.405
It's all good.
Anyway, um...

34:34.447 --> 34:37.033
Look, I know Murphy's
going to prison.

34:37.075 --> 34:40.578
And you're just
my friend's friend.

34:40.620 --> 34:43.247
But don't go down
that road, man.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.833
I'm not going down any road.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.921
Uh-huh.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.840
Look, I know
you guys had a thing.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.551
Uh-huh.
And that's cool.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.013
But we just
get each other.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.269
This is what she does.

35:05.311 --> 35:07.355
She makes you think
you guys have

35:07.396 --> 35:09.690
this special connection
or whatever.

35:09.732 --> 35:12.568
All she does is distract you
while she messes up your life.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.987
Look at me, man.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.073
I know you think
she likes you.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.450
But she's just using you
to get what she wants.

35:21.577 --> 35:23.663
Trust me.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.756
DARNELL:
All right, take care
of yourselves.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.299

FELIX:
Yeah, please do.

35:36.592 --> 35:38.344
MURPHY:
Thank you for everything.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.346
DARNELL:
Yo, Trey, wait up.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.515
What's up?

35:42.557 --> 35:45.059
Nothing, I just want to make
sure you're good.

35:45.101 --> 35:47.478
This is, uh...

35:47.520 --> 35:49.772
you know, it's a lot.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.774
Want to grab a bite
to eat or something?

35:51.816 --> 35:53.901
Nah, man.

35:53.943 --> 35:55.778
I'm still pretty exhausted.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.156
Plus I should figure out
what I'm gonna do for work.

35:58.197 --> 36:00.283
All right.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.579
I'll hit you up later.
All right.

36:04.620 --> 36:07.290
Stay blessed.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.964
Beau. Listen.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.091
It's back on.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.927
I'm gonna need you to grab
as much "H" as you can

36:19.969 --> 36:21.679
before the cops get there.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.723
We want to make sure
we give them plenty of space

36:23.764 --> 36:25.349
to get to the stairs.
(entry bell jingles)

36:26.684 --> 36:28.769
Hey, heads up.

36:37.111 --> 36:39.155
Hello, Murphy.

36:41.949 --> 36:44.035
Hi.

36:48.623 --> 36:49.916
Why aren't we
in a safe house?

36:49.957 --> 36:51.375
Look, I'll explain
everything.

36:51.417 --> 36:52.752
Max Parish.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.172
I'm Josh Wallace.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.924
Nice to finally meet you.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.720
Okay, then.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.347
Should we get started?

37:04.388 --> 37:05.848
MURPHY:
Get started?

37:05.890 --> 37:08.351
Just arrest us and go get Jess.

37:08.392 --> 37:10.144
Well, it's not
as simple as that.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.647
The chief didn't go for this, so
we have to improvise a little.

37:12.688 --> 37:14.649
What do you mean "improvise"?

37:14.690 --> 37:18.194
JOSH:
Look, without a warrant,
our options are limited, but...

37:18.236 --> 37:20.238
if you guys go in first
and lead us to Jess,

37:20.279 --> 37:23.241
then... we're well within
our legal bounds.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.119
Okay, I don't--

37:27.161 --> 37:29.330
I don't care, just tell us
what we have to do.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.831
Okay.

37:30.873 --> 37:32.541
Here's how it's gonna go down.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.002
The last thing we want is
to tip Josiah off.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.755
So you have to follow our
instructions to a tee.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.676
When you guys leave here,
get back in your car.

37:41.717 --> 37:44.303
Gene will place a GPS,
so don't get any ideas.

37:44.345 --> 37:47.098
We'll follow you
the whole way to the arcade.

37:57.024 --> 37:59.277
All right, man.
Here we go.

38:04.365 --> 38:07.034
JOSH:
It's a 30-minute trip.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.829
And we'll have eyes on you
the whole time.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.888
(nearby thud)

38:35.771 --> 38:36.731
Wow.

38:36.772 --> 38:38.274
Al, hang on.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.484
I don't even know what to say.

38:40.526 --> 38:41.944
Is this what you do?

38:41.986 --> 38:43.738
You just steal drugs
every night?

38:43.779 --> 38:46.073
No! Listen, the cops are coming
to bust Josiah.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.867
But Trey's gonna use
what I can get to start over.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.327
What?
We can be
at the top.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.412
I'm gonna be
Trey's right-hand man.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.794
Alex, wait!
No.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.421
I don't want anything
to do with this!

39:00.463 --> 39:02.590
Josiah's gonna kill us both
if he finds out!

39:02.631 --> 39:04.592
All right.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.052
Hey, give me your keys.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.762
Mine are inside.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.847
So are mine!

39:09.889 --> 39:12.516
We-we got to get out of here.

39:12.558 --> 39:13.726
The cops are gonna
be here soon.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.353
I'm not going anywhere with you.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.606
Fine.

39:20.816 --> 39:22.943
JOSH:
Now we'll wait until
the last possible second

39:22.985 --> 39:24.779
to sound our sirens.

39:24.820 --> 39:27.031
We don't want to tip off Josiah.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.575
GENE:
With any luck,

39:29.617 --> 39:31.118
he won't know what hit him.
