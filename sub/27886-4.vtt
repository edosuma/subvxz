14:20.901 --> 14:24.572
I have that, but with names.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.448
Oh, come on. You're fucking with me.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.617
I mean, people really like
to fuck with me, so just--

14:28.701 --> 14:30.578
No, no, no, it's a real condition.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.787
Mmm, what's that called?

14:31.871 --> 14:32.913
It's, uh...

14:32.997 --> 14:34.373
it's called name aphasia.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.210
Yes, it's a very serious condition.
You can google it after I leave.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.839
Anyway, uh, my boyfriend came in here
and he bought me an engagement ring.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.674
Congratulations. That's wonderful.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.427
Thank you so much. It's terrific.
It's an exciting time. Uh...

14:46.510 --> 14:48.971
I want to make sure
that he got me the right ring.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.267
Okay, so he's about six feet tall,
early thirties.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.896
He's got, like, disturbingly good posture.
You know, like, he stands very erect.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.814
Like this, but a spine.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.233
Oh, yes. He kind of looks
like Derek Jeter,

15:01.317 --> 15:04.194
who, like, obviously goes to the gym
all the time,

15:04.278 --> 15:06.614
and he's incredibly buff,
but not 'cause he's vain,

15:06.697 --> 15:08.657
he's just really compulsive, right?
Bingo. That is my weirdo.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.455
Yeah. He came in here about 20 times.

15:14.538 --> 15:17.875
And then he ended up picking
the most basic ring.

15:17.958 --> 15:18.834
No offense.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.795
No, not at all. Uh, do you know his name?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.257
Do I know your boyfriend's name?

15:25.341 --> 15:26.258
Yes.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.260
Okay, listen, this is really weird.
Would it kill you
to go look in the back?

15:30.346 --> 15:32.890
I think you're lying to me,
and I think it's time to go.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.768
I'm not lying to you.
Maybe you're lying. Maybe you're a liar.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.019
It's your boyfriend!

15:37.519 --> 15:38.604
Yes.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.565
What, are you accusing me
of sleeping with your boyfriend?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.818
Listen, I'm a professional.
Do you understand?

15:44.902 --> 15:46.278
You know what?

15:46.362 --> 15:48.614
I think you're just in here
trying to find things out

15:48.697 --> 15:52.034
'cause you want to sell something
that somebody gifted you.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.119
You want to bring it
to a pawn shop or what?

15:54.203 --> 15:56.789
-I don't know, but it's time to go.
-So you don't have the name?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.916
-Out! Go! Now!
-No problem.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.542
You know what? I applaud your instincts.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.503
I see why they trust you
with all these jewels.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.754
Mmm. A bunch of malarkey.

16:04.838 --> 16:05.756
Bye.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.261
[sighs]

16:14.431 --> 16:15.557
Come on, baby.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.268
Mm-hmm.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.561
Alan Zaveri.

16:20.062 --> 16:20.896
Hmm.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.191
Looks like somebody really likes shawarma.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.119
-Wanna talk about it?
-What?

16:36.036 --> 16:36.996
The break up, man.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.831
-Oh.
-Beatrice. This Mike asshole.
Yeah. No, I mean, I...

16:40.958 --> 16:43.043
I don't think there's anything to...
to say.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.670
How long has this been going on for?

16:45.587 --> 16:46.672
I don't, um...

16:47.172 --> 16:49.341
I didn't really ask.
I didn't really ask a lot of things.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.760
I would have asked...

16:52.803 --> 16:54.430
so many things. I mean--

16:55.764 --> 16:57.307
I never really liked Beatrice.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.308
What?

16:58.892 --> 17:03.063
Yeah, I mean, I never said anything mean
'cause she was just always... there.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.402
You know, Sheree cheated on me once
when we first started dating.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.738
You never told me that.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.490
Yeah, we actually went
to couple's therapy and everything.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.660
I don't know.
Eventually things just got better.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.997
But I wanted to know everything:

17:20.080 --> 17:21.457
how many times it happened,

17:22.041 --> 17:23.083
where it happened,

17:23.751 --> 17:25.294
who was this guy.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.630
Was she gonna do it again?

17:28.714 --> 17:30.591
-I don't. I can't.
-Why?

17:31.467 --> 17:32.551
I don't do therapy.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.012
I know you don't,
but it's worth a shot, okay?

17:35.846 --> 17:38.807
And Sean helped me and Sheree
get through our problems.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.810
I mean, having a third person there
really kind of gave us perspective.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.438
I can-- I-- I can do it by myself. I can.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.649
No one can do anything by themselves.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.531
[buzzes repeatedly]

17:58.786 --> 18:02.122
Oh, hey, Coco.
Uh, I'm Alan's buddy, six L.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.709
-His buzzer's broken. Can you let me in?
-How do I know you're not a murderer?

18:06.835 --> 18:08.295
My sparkling personality?

18:09.046 --> 18:10.964
-How many people have you murdered?
-None.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.217
That's what a murderer would say.

18:17.888 --> 18:18.722
[Nadia] Really?

18:20.724 --> 18:23.227
Do I know you? What the fuck is this?

18:31.151 --> 18:33.987
Hey, man, I tried to jimmy your lock,

18:34.071 --> 18:36.156
but I guess that shit
only works in movies, huh.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.867
How did you find me?

18:39.451 --> 18:41.912
Uh, we're neighbors.
I live around the corner on Fifth and B.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.832
-No, no, thank you. No.
-Oh. No, I'm not selling anything, dude.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.543
Do you think it's weird
that we live in the same neighborhood?

18:47.626 --> 18:49.419
Do you think it means anything?

18:49.503 --> 18:51.547
Do you think we're dead?
That we're the same person?

18:51.630 --> 18:54.049
You know, I got a couple of theories
that I'm working on.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.677
Us being the same person
is my current favorite.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.679
How would that even work
that we could possibly--

18:58.762 --> 19:00.931
Check it out, check it out.
Can you feel this?

19:01.431 --> 19:03.559
Does it hurt? Is it hurting you?
It's hurting me.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.810
Okay, stop. Just...

19:05.519 --> 19:08.313
Hey, look, pal.
I'm not so sweet on you either, okay?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.357
But right now
you're the only lead I've got.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.652
-Lead?
-Yeah, you know, uh, clue.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.739
To get out of this,
whatever this is, this situation.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.992
There is no way out of this situation.

19:20.075 --> 19:23.287
And, personally, I liked it.
I had control. I-- I knew what was coming.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.290
And then you showed up
and led me down this weird path,

19:26.373 --> 19:27.749
like a carcinogenic Siren.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.252
-You're welcome.
-No, I'm not thanking you.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.297
You showed up and everything has gone off.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.842
I-- I learned something
I really didn't want to know.

19:38.468 --> 19:42.681
Beatrice, my girlfriend for nine years,
has been cheating on me.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.350
[Nadia] Whoa. That's very heavy.

19:45.434 --> 19:50.022
If you'd like to meet up again, I will be
at my birthday party yesterday night.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.691
-You're restarting on your birthday?
-Ah, yes. Yes, I am.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.819
The party's at the old yeshiva on Tenth
and A, all right? You can't miss it.

19:55.903 --> 19:59.823
And I can tell that you're really bent out
of shape about this Beatrice character,

19:59.907 --> 20:04.328
but, you know, we literally just met,
so, like, none of this is on me.

20:05.495 --> 20:06.413
[Nadia sighs]

20:06.955 --> 20:09.583
From what I gather,
we are in this together.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.606

20:33.732 --> 20:37.069
if you think about Faulkner's influence
on William Styron...

20:37.986 --> 20:39.446
Styron's protagonist...

20:40.447 --> 20:43.700
and living with the legacy
of slave-holding territories...

20:45.244 --> 20:46.245
it lays...

20:46.828 --> 20:50.082
very nicely
on top of the counter narrative...

20:50.666 --> 20:53.335
of German concentration camp survivors.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.795
So we have a hero...

20:55.337 --> 20:57.464
right, who's-- who's haunted by,

20:57.547 --> 20:59.591

-Fucking Christ.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.488
-You're an asshole.
-Who are you?

21:21.571 --> 21:23.073
I'm Beatrice's boyfriend.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.867
[exhales] Ah.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.786

-You're, uh-- You're Alan.

21:27.869 --> 21:28.870
-Yeah.

We're fine. You can go.
No, no, no, you don't know me.

Listen, Alan. We can talk about this.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.050
-That's enough, all right? That's enough!
-Okay, I'm going!

21:42.134 --> 21:45.470
Alan... she's unhappy, man.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.598
I'm just her excuse to leave.
