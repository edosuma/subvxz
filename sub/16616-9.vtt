00:01.585 --> 00:04.546
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.630 --> 00:08.050
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.217 --> 00:11.470
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.803 --> 00:14.306
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:17.476
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:21.146
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.563 --> 00:23.106
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:24.650
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:29.696
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.244 --> 00:38.622
<i>We now return to</i>
How David Lynch Stole Christmas.

00:40.499 --> 00:43.669
Hello, I got you a present.
It's a thumb.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.923
Don't look away,
let the fear wash over you.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.634
- I don't understand.
- That's the whole point.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.428
Now, did you leave a plate
of black coffee out for me?

00:53.512 --> 00:55.180
- No.
- In the future,

00:55.264 --> 00:58.267
please leave a plate of black coffee
out for me.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.018
Also in the past.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.105
You guys,
what are you doing watching TV?

01:03.188 --> 01:04.731
- It's snowing.
- Really?

01:05.357 --> 01:08.402
- Wow, it's so beautiful.
- Isn't it?

01:08.485 --> 01:10.279
And you know what's a miracle, kids?

01:10.362 --> 01:13.532
Every single snow flake is exactly alike.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.117
I don't think that's right.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.327
No, it's true. Just like finger prints.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.246
All right, you guys ready for church?

01:19.371 --> 01:20.622
Church? What are you, an idiot?

01:20.706 --> 01:23.041
It's the first snow of the season.
We're going sledding.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.710
Please, can we, Mom?

01:24.793 --> 01:27.171
- Well, I mean, it's Sunday.
- Come on, Lois.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.257
After all, sledding was
the second passion of the Christ.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.135
Eat this, for this is my dust.

01:38.015 --> 01:41.810
My sled has "Dora" on it 'cause
my parents got it at a yard sale.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.478
It's still for boys, though.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.981
She's about language acquisition,
not gender.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.195
Sorry, fun seekers.
This hill is closed to sledding.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.696
What? What are you talking about?

01:52.779 --> 01:54.990
Too many pansy-assed parents sue the city

01:55.073 --> 01:58.493
when their kids sprain a finger
or crush their skull on a bumper.

01:58.577 --> 02:01.622
I'm afraid sledding has been banned
in Quahog.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.748
You can't do that.

02:02.873 --> 02:06.043
The last time I check this was
still the <i>United States of Tara.</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:08.295
- Obscure reference.
- And I'm not gonna let anybody tell me

02:08.378 --> 02:10.172
where I can and cannot sled.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.217
Yeah, you're right.
Power to the people.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.010
The whole world is watching.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.137
The whole world is watching.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.307
What... What just happened?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.643
- Who cares. Last one down the hill...

02:22.726 --> 02:23.769
Oh, my God!

02:23.852 --> 02:26.897
Call my mom.
I crushed my skull on a bumper.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.529
You serious all this white stuff
used to be water?

02:33.612 --> 02:35.656
Mmm. My word.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.824
- Joe, what are you riding on?
- Oh, it's a bed pan.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.368
I got a ton of these at home.

02:39.451 --> 02:42.120
You make every activity incredibly sad.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.459
There you are. Where have you been?

02:47.543 --> 02:50.170
I just ran home to get
the big sled out of our dining room.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.338
What are you talking about?

02:51.421 --> 02:52.881
We don't have a sled in our dining room.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.258
Everybody on.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.635
Peter, that dining room table
is an antique.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.720
It's been in my family for
six generations.

02:58.804 --> 03:02.474
It's fine. Okay, now, since we're
white guys doing something stupid,

03:02.558 --> 03:03.976
everybody grab a GoPro.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.357
Yeah, this is awesome.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.860
Oh, we're drifting, we're turning,
we're turning.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.237
- Dad, I'm scared.
- We're backwards!

03:15.362 --> 03:18.991
Am I the only one who thinks
that now we're at an alarming speed?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.165
Peter, are you insane?

03:27.249 --> 03:29.251
You could have killed the entire family!

03:29.334 --> 03:32.004
Sorry, Lois, I honestly thought
this was going to be fun.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.173
Like, when I won that sex contest.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.842
First again!
Wasn't even close, was it?

03:36.925 --> 03:39.219
No, Peter.
It wasn't even close.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.846
Yeah, you are terrible at this.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.974
Now, why don't you clean up
and go get the champ a Gatorade, huh?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.857
You wearing pants always amuses me.

03:51.940 --> 03:52.941
Yeah, I know.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.151
It's just that I got roped in
to go to some

03:54.234 --> 03:56.904
stupid office Christmas party
with this girl I'm dating.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.489
Really? I thought you just went
to an office Christmas party

03:59.573 --> 04:00.616
with her last week?

04:00.699 --> 04:02.159
What? Oh, no.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.536
Um, no, that was this other girl
I was dating.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.539
Um, her name was Couch.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.749
Did you just say couch,

04:08.832 --> 04:11.627
but pronounce it strangely
so it sounded like a name?

04:11.710 --> 04:13.003
What's going on, Brian?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.087
All right, look.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.714
I've been crashing office
Christmas parties

04:15.797 --> 04:17.341
for the free booze and drunk women

04:17.424 --> 04:19.134
who don't want to spend
the holidays alone.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.220
Oh, so, you're a Christmas party creep.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.805
Just like the fat man
is a pool party creep.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.725
Now, Chris, you're getting older.
So it's time for you to learn

04:26.808 --> 04:28.560
the classic pool party game,

04:28.644 --> 04:32.523
"Talk to somebody's wife in a bikini
until they cover up uncomfortably."

04:32.606 --> 04:34.191
So, Bonnie, how are things going?

04:34.399 --> 04:35.734
Oh, things are fine.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.486
Been kind of busy lately.

04:37.653 --> 04:39.530
What with Susie starting to...

04:39.613 --> 04:40.822
Okay, bye.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.866
I had her for two seconds.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.452
Hey, Peter. What have you been
watching on TV lately?

04:45.536 --> 04:46.745
Oh, you know, this and that.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.331
There's a show called <i>Shipping Wars</i>
that's actually kinda...

04:49.414 --> 04:50.749
Okay, bye.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.258
Oh, boy.
The Marshals is now a Nordstrom.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.176
I feel like our days at this mall
are numbered.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.803
Well, we have $60.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.597
Let's see what kind of Chinese
press board garbage we can get

05:05.681 --> 05:08.267
to replace my grandmother's
priceless mahogany table.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.852
Dad, look. Santa's here.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.647
I want to sit on his lap.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.566
Jeez, Christ. Come on.
You're in high school.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.818
I'm gonna ask him for a family trampoline.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.070
Holy crap. Get your ass up there.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.365
You know what, Peter,
I'll get the table myself.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.952
And then I might just sit in that car
in the middle of the mall and cry.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.747
Sheesh, look at this line.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.791
Yeah, no kidding.
And it's not moving.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.919
Me and my adopted son
have been waiting quite a while.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.672
But... Why did you...

05:38.881 --> 05:41.800
- I didn't even ask.
- So, is your son a biolog?

05:41.884 --> 05:43.135
What? I'm not...

05:43.218 --> 05:45.596
I don't watch <i>Modern Family,</i> sorry.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.723
Chris, wait here.
I'm gonna see what's going on.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.475
Hey, muscles, what's taking so long?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.853
I'm sorry, sir. This may shock you,

05:52.936 --> 05:56.398
but it turns out the seasonal Santa
we hired has a drinking problem.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.109
And I don't where to find
a replacement on such short notice.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.570
Hey, you're a hefty guy.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.988
I called you "muscles".

06:03.071 --> 06:05.324
Would you mind putting on the suit
and playing Santa?

06:05.407 --> 06:07.868
Just until the shift ends.
I'd pay you for your time.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.036
All right, fine.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.330
It's not the first time
I pretended to be someone else.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.750
I once dressed as a farmer
to get a date on farmersonly.com.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.711
- Are you Peter?
- Yeah.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.756
Are you the gross lady who lives
in the converted horse trailer?

06:21.048 --> 06:24.176
<i>You don't have to be lonely</i>

06:24.259 --> 06:27.429
<i>At farmersonly.com</i>

06:27.596 --> 06:30.641
It doesn't say whites only, but, yeah...

06:40.234 --> 06:42.486
'Sup? Slammin' pantsuit.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.779
Hey, I'm Scott Fitzgerald.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.906
You probably don't recognize me
'cause I'm in corporate.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.492
So am I. This is corporate.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.869
Little too much so if you ask me.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.664
I try to have fun, right. I mean...

06:53.789 --> 06:55.541
We're not landing planes here.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.585
Our company manufactures
aircraft landing gear systems.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.170
Yep. Mmm-hmm.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.632
Well, I am gonna fly us over
a few more drinks.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.053
- Stewie, what are you doing here?
- I followed you.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.557
I had to see for myself just how
desperate and pathetic you really are.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.892
And don't worry, I'm not
sticking around this sad little...

07:13.976 --> 07:15.686
Ooh, is that rolled up ham for everyone?

07:15.894 --> 07:17.437
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.189
Well, I'll see you at home...

07:19.273 --> 07:21.441
Okay, everyone,
karaoke's starting.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.735
Well, I can watch and make fun
for just a few...

07:23.819 --> 07:26.196
Oh, my God.
They have a photo booth with funny props.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.990
Oh, I call the big funny glasses!

07:28.824 --> 07:32.244
<i>Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock</i>

07:32.744 --> 07:36.331
<i>Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring</i>

07:39.918 --> 07:42.087
...and I want a tricycle, and a pony,

07:42.171 --> 07:43.630
and an American girl doll,

07:43.714 --> 07:46.300
and a drone with a camera,
and a gun that fires.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.427
Ho, ho, ho. Yeah, sure. All of it.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.180
All right, now go pick up your picture.

07:51.263 --> 07:54.474
And before you go crying to your mom,
that's my cellphone you're feeling.

07:56.852 --> 07:59.062
Hey, Santa Claus.
You going home soon?

07:59.146 --> 08:02.191
Oh, well, depending on how traffic is
at the North Pole.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.028
So, what can I get for you today?
Milk and cookies?

08:06.153 --> 08:09.698
Okay, sorry I started this.
Chicken Burrito, please.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.034
There you go. Merry Christmas!

08:12.117 --> 08:13.285
Now, how much do I...

08:13.368 --> 08:15.287
Oh, come on.
I'm not charging Santa Claus.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.455
It's on the house.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.166
This is free
because I'm dressed as Santa?

08:19.249 --> 08:21.251
That's right. Anything for Santa.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.377
Anything?

08:22.544 --> 08:25.297
Holy crap! This is awesome.
I'm Santa Claus.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.382
In this suit I'm like a god!

08:32.638 --> 08:34.139
I got a free burrito.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.233
Look at these two lumps.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.985
<i>Hop on the house top</i>
<i>Click, click, click</i>

08:47.069 --> 08:48.820
<i>Slipped on the chimney</i>
<i>And broke his...</i>

08:48.904 --> 08:50.030
Morning! Penis.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.866
Dad, why are you
still wearing that Santa suit?

08:52.950 --> 08:55.327
Well, the guy at the mall
asked me to stay on till Christmas

08:55.410 --> 08:57.538
and I said yes,
because being Santa's awesome.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.498
You wear this suit,
it's like a free pass.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.334
- People let you do anything you want.
- What are you talking about?

09:02.417 --> 09:04.294
Oh, it's the stuff of dreams, Lois.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.172
Free burritos, free orange chicken,
free pretzels.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.007
Did you make it out of the food court?

09:09.091 --> 09:10.217
I made it to the border.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.719
I got a free iPhone case
and a tiny license plate.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.848
- It says Corey.
- Yep. Cost me zilch.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.857
So, who's this Mary Christmas
everybody keeps talking about?

09:26.859 --> 09:28.735
That's very clever.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.530
Yeah, I don't recognize you.
Which department are you in?

09:31.613 --> 09:34.157
Well, right now I'm in boob assessment.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.242
Ew.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.579
Hey, you were right about office
Christmas parties. They're fantastic.

09:38.871 --> 09:41.623
Uh-huh. Okay. I'm gonna keep looking
around the room while you talk.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.375
Yes, it's like watching a soap opera.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.420
What with all the drunken misbehavior
and ill-advised hookups.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.547
And down the hall,
they're doing a white elephant.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.840
Oh, that gift exchange thing?

09:49.923 --> 09:52.509
No, there's a fat secretary
taking on all comers.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.761
Where... Which office is that in?

09:54.845 --> 09:57.556
Oh, you won't miss her.
She's still wearing the felt antlers.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.516
Absolute freak show in there.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.436
Hey, what the hell's going on?

10:02.519 --> 10:05.397
Oh, Santa. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize this was your car.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.858
That's right.
Now crumple up that ticket.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.277
Now, eat it.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.406
All right, now we're gonna go
to your home and wait for you to pass it

10:14.489 --> 10:16.158
and then you're gonna eat it again.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.076
Hey, honey. This is Santa.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.912
He's gonna come in
and watch me in the bathroom.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.372
- Oh, just like the Easter bunny did.
- Exactly.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.458
I got a lot of guys coming through here.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.755
<i>The next composition is Opus Dei.</i>

10:29.838 --> 10:31.465
<i>Dei Dei Patter.</i>

10:31.548 --> 10:33.800
<i>Seventh movement by Chopin.</i>

10:37.763 --> 10:40.599
<i>Correction, the next composition is...</i>

10:40.682 --> 10:43.977
<i>1-877-Kars-4Kids.</i>

10:47.439 --> 10:51.026
<i>1-877-Kars-4Kids</i>

10:51.151 --> 10:54.571
<i>K-A-R-S-Kars-4Kids</i>

10:54.863 --> 10:58.325
<i>1-877-Kars-4Kids</i>

10:58.408 --> 11:01.411
<i>Donate your car today</i>

11:02.788 --> 11:04.915
I lost my virginity to this song.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.090
- Ugh, this party's a dud.
- Yeah, no kidding.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.844
That lady turned off a Hall & Oates
song because it was too provocative.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.596
Everyone, let's remember,
this is still a work place.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.432
- Sorry, Barb.
- You know what? I got an idea.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.352
I'm gonna stir up some drama,
make this party interesting.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.273
Excuse me, uh,
can I have your attention please?

11:29.356 --> 11:33.026
Hi, hi, I'm Chadwick Redmain
from the regional office.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.404
Unfortunately, since people
only use printers now

11:35.487 --> 11:38.115
to print out boarding passes
for their grandparents,

11:38.198 --> 11:41.034
40 percent of you will be laid off
as of Monday.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.620
Oh, and whoever drinks
the most shots keeps their job.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.502
See, that's how you get a party started.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.546
Mr. Redmain,
I don't know who you are,

11:52.629 --> 11:55.257
but I've been in charge of this office
for 16 years.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.967
- Sad.
- And I wanna thank you.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.178
I've been trying to reduce our
staff costs for months,

11:59.261 --> 12:02.347
but just didn't have the guts to do it,
much less before Christmas.

12:02.431 --> 12:06.476
Yeah, well, that's why they send in
Channing Redwick or Chadmain or...

12:06.560 --> 12:08.353
I don't even remember what I said.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.480
We could use someone like you
around here.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.399
Welcome aboard, see you Monday.

12:13.692 --> 12:17.070
Wow, a paying grown up job!
I haven't been this excited about

12:17.154 --> 12:19.656
anything since the night
<i>Wicked</i> premiered in Quahog.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.034
All right, Brian,
let's rob these gay guys.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.912
- What if they're home?
- They're not gonna be home.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.835
- Bye, Santa!
- Bye, strippers.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.171
You can all take your clothes off now.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.757
I was just coming in for the spaghetti.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.179
Bitch! Oh, that hurts!

12:43.013 --> 12:45.766
I'm drunk, heart's beating fast.

12:50.771 --> 12:54.525
Spaghetti Angel!
I'm making a spaghetti angel.

12:54.608 --> 12:59.446
When Italian guys die, they turn into...

13:04.117 --> 13:06.328
Peter, Peter Griffin.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.083
Peter, we need to talk.

13:11.333 --> 13:15.045
- Who are you?
- I'm the real Santa Claus.

13:15.254 --> 13:19.258
Awesome! Okay, my first wish
is for a thousand wishes. Yes!

13:19.341 --> 13:20.801
That's not me, that's a genie.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.387
Okay, then my first wish is for a genie.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.139
Again, you'd need a genie.
How wasted are you?

13:26.223 --> 13:29.351
- Don't judge me, you live in a bottle.
- It's a lamp.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.103
And I'm not a genie!

13:37.609 --> 13:40.070
All right, come on now, pal.
Seriously, who are you really?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.281
I already told you, I'm Santa Claus.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.242
Oh, yeah? Well, if you are Santa
then what did I ask for,

13:45.325 --> 13:46.785
for Christmas when I was 12?

13:46.869 --> 13:49.997
Nothing. Because it was the year
you found that <i>Penthouse</i> in the woods.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.124
You really are Santa!

13:52.499 --> 13:56.253
Am I really heavier than you?
I gotta take control.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.756
Look, I'm not very happy with you.
You can't go around in that suit,

13:59.840 --> 14:02.384
pretending you're me
and acting like a complete jackass.

14:02.467 --> 14:03.552
What are you talking about?

14:03.635 --> 14:05.345
People love me, they give me free stuff.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.807
No, they love me.
You're just exploiting my brand

14:08.891 --> 14:11.268
for personal gain
and destroying my reputation.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.270
So there's like no toilet on the sleigh,

14:13.353 --> 14:16.023
so you're just crapping
in people's houses, right?

14:16.106 --> 14:17.274
You're not hearing me!

14:17.357 --> 14:20.736
- Stop wearing that suit, or else...
- Or else, what?

14:21.069 --> 14:25.240
Or else I will put you
at the top of my naughty list.

14:25.324 --> 14:27.492
You know, you're not talking
to a little kid any more,

14:27.576 --> 14:29.203
so get the hell out of my face, Santa.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.038
I like this suit and I'm keeping it.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.289
Now if you'll excuse me,

14:32.372 --> 14:34.499
you're standing in my strip club
spaghetti.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.460
I gotta get this home to my family
for supper.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.884
You better watch out.

14:55.229 --> 14:59.399
Gail, Gail! Is your Internet working?
Mine is slow.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.404
Oh, my God, Gail, what happened?

15:04.488 --> 15:07.741
I just found out I'm part of
the downsizing you announced.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.159
Oh, no!

15:09.243 --> 15:12.496
So your Internet, is it... is it slow?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.165
Gail, you were supposed to be gone
an hour ago.

15:15.249 --> 15:18.335
Hey, give her a break, man,
this is Gail Devereux Slansky.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.129
Oh, it's just Gail Devereux now.

15:21.338 --> 15:24.007
- Ugh, tough week.
- Why don't you stop rubber necking

15:24.091 --> 15:26.385
and finish that payroll report
I asked for?

15:26.927 --> 15:30.722
I can't believe I got fired.
And right before the holidays.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.183
Oh, God, I've ruined Christmas.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.562
Like the little drummer boy
when he got really into Neil Peart.

15:39.439 --> 15:45.195
<i>Our finest gifts we bring</i>
<i>Pa rapa pum pum</i>

16:03.881 --> 16:05.924
Christmas is gonna be sick!

16:10.554 --> 16:12.890
So, Dad, now that you made Santa mad,

16:12.973 --> 16:15.350
aren't you scared that
he's gonna do something bad to you?

16:15.434 --> 16:17.811
Ah, Santa's all talk.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

16:20.314 --> 16:24.276
- Hey Peter, ready to go to Build-A-Bear?
- What? What're you talking about?

16:24.401 --> 16:26.320
I got your text, it says, "Hey, Joe,

16:26.403 --> 16:28.405
"cancel your plans,
let's go to Build-A-Bear."

16:28.488 --> 16:29.865
I didn't send you a...

16:29.948 --> 16:33.285
Oh, son of a bitch! Santa.
Joe, I did not send you a text.

16:33.452 --> 16:37.998
Well, you sent another text that says,
"Hey, Joe, it's definitely me, Peter,

16:38.081 --> 16:41.210
-"who sent the text".
- Damn it! He covered all bases.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.755
What do you think, Peter?
Maybe a little sun hat for Cindy?

16:44.838 --> 16:46.924
Whatever, I'm done with my bear.
Let's get out of here.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.843
Well, the text you sent earlier
would disagree.

16:49.927 --> 16:53.805
You said, "No matter what I say,
I wanna build multiple bears."

16:53.889 --> 16:56.391
Joe, I swear to you
I do not wanna do that.

16:57.601 --> 17:00.020
News flash, Peter, looks like you do.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.610
Would anyone like to lead the family
in a holiday prayer?

17:06.693 --> 17:09.446
I'll tell ya who should be
saying his prayers, Santa!

17:09.530 --> 17:11.281
He messes with me, I mess with him.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.867
That's why I replaced
one of his flying reindeer with

17:13.951 --> 17:15.619
an ordinary non magical one.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.041
Cut it off, cut it off!

17:25.963 --> 17:28.841
You know, I think this year
is gonna be the best...

17:30.008 --> 17:31.802
Yay, free horse!

17:42.396 --> 17:45.315
What the hell?
Hey, Chris, get in here!

17:45.399 --> 17:48.777
This is impossible, right?
All of Meg's farts here in this box.

17:48.861 --> 17:50.153
I would think that's impossible.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.989
Yeah, right? That's impossible!

17:53.991 --> 17:55.742
- Is this the box?
- Yeah, that's it.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.455
- Yeah, that's impossible.
- I know, it's impossible.

18:00.539 --> 18:01.874
Okay, all right, I'm opening it.

18:01.957 --> 18:04.334
Unless whoever sent it was magic.

18:04.835 --> 18:06.545
Oh, well, that's interesting.

18:11.592 --> 18:13.427
Chad, we gotta talk about this report.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.429
Why do you write
all your twos backwards?

18:15.512 --> 18:17.306
Well, you know it's a two,
so why are we talking?

18:17.389 --> 18:19.141
Fix it or you're fired.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.352
You know what?
I thought working in a cubicle

18:22.436 --> 18:25.981
at a midsized printing company
would be the adventure of a lifetime.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.734
Instead, it's been nothing
but tedium and cruelty.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.777
It's time to set things right.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.780
Here you go, Warren, Merry Christmas.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.532
Eleven thousand dollars?

18:35.616 --> 18:39.328
Yes, it's the maximum check amount
I am authorized to cut. Cash it fast.

18:40.579 --> 18:43.790
Merry Christmas, cash it fast.
Merry Christmas, cash it fast.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.543
- Merry Christmas, cash it fast.
- Thanks, Chadwick.

18:46.627 --> 18:49.671
- This is awesome!
- I think you mean "Happy holidays".

18:56.011 --> 18:57.721
You gotta be kidding me.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.476
This is too good.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.151
Point Griffin.
Let's see you top...

19:11.693 --> 19:14.321
Now you gonna listen?
Now you gonna listen, you little bitch?

19:14.404 --> 19:16.156
- Whose suit are you wearing?
- Your suit!

19:16.281 --> 19:18.867
- Whose suit?
- Your suit, it's your suit!

19:22.079 --> 19:24.831
Okay, okay, I'll never wear
that Santa suit again!

19:24.915 --> 19:28.043
Just stop terrorizing me
and take me off the naughty list!

19:28.126 --> 19:29.628
- You promise?
- Yes.

19:31.004 --> 19:35.425
Thank you. I've always known you were
a good boy deep inside, Peter.

19:35.509 --> 19:39.513
And just so you know, there are
no hard feelings. This is for you.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.683
It's that <i>Penthouse</i> you found
in the woods.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.353
With Vanessa Williams
and George Burns on the cover!

19:46.478 --> 19:47.604
I'm glad you like it!

19:47.688 --> 19:50.107
I had to buy it from
a really creepy guy on the Internet.

19:50.691 --> 19:53.443
Look, Santa, I owe you an apology.

19:53.527 --> 19:56.071
I'm sorry I took advantage
of your good name.

19:56.154 --> 19:59.616
You spread so much joy and wonder
to kids everywhere,

19:59.700 --> 20:02.703
and I just used that to get stuff
for myself.

20:03.036 --> 20:08.208
Apology accepted, and truth is,
you weren't the worst Santa.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.960
This was the worst Santa.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.964
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.717
Oh, and that's another thing. It's...
"Ho, ho, ho."

20:16.800 --> 20:19.553
Everybody pronounces it wrong,
it's very irritating.

20:24.391 --> 20:28.145
So long, Peter.
Glad to have you back on the nice list.

20:36.737 --> 20:40.324
Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho!

20:46.079 --> 20:49.082
<i>And that was the Christmas</i>
<i>I would never forget.</i>

20:49.458 --> 20:53.045
<i>Until I went home and had</i>
<i>like 50 beers, and did forget.</i>

20:53.128 --> 20:55.923
<i>But only after I screamed</i>
<i>myself into a blackout,</i>

20:56.089 --> 20:58.217
<i>while my whole family held me down.</i>

20:58.550 --> 21:00.385
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>
