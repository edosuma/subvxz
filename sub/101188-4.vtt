00:11.553 --> 00:13.055
You want to talk about it?
- No.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.515
- Are you sure?

00:14.598 --> 00:16.725
- Are you fucking deaf?
I said I don't want to talk about it.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.727
Okay? I don't want to talk about it.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.605
- Barbara, fuck that guy.
You're beautiful.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.024
- I'm not. You heard him. I'm disgusting,

00:24.107 --> 00:25.609
and I'm useless.
- No, you're not.

00:25.692 --> 00:26.860
- Yes, I am.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.153
I'm a monster.

00:28.237 --> 00:31.323
- You're a monster?
Oh, God. No-- Ugh. Look at me.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.492
- So you have a little cellulite,
like, whatever.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.826
So much better than having

00:34.910 --> 00:36.828
fucking melty fingers and melty toes.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.622
- I'm too ugly to be sexually harassed

00:38.705 --> 00:40.916
by the agent who was fired
for sexual harassment.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.210
- Okay, I just said that to make
you feel bad about yourself.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.254
I'm sure, like,
he just respected you as a writer.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.713
- No, I'm, like,
a fucking terrible writer.

00:46.797 --> 00:47.881
- No, I'm sure you're a great writer.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.299
- No, I'm not. Trust me.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.676
- Okay, well,
I'd rather be a terrible writer

00:50.759 --> 00:52.010
than a useless sex doll.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.221
- Barbara, you're being
so hard on yourself.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.889
Like, why do you think I just spent

00:55.973 --> 00:57.391
all that money to get you fixed?

00:57.474 --> 00:59.726
- You were just trying
to save your own ass.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.938
- No, I wanted to keep you
'cause I fucking like you, man.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.523
- You do?

01:04.606 --> 01:06.233
- Yeah.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.901
We got to go

01:07.985 --> 01:09.945
'cause, you know,
we still need to beat Dan home.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.238
- We should go.
- Okay.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.531
- Actually,

01:12.614 --> 01:14.575
Cody, would you mind
if I just had a moment

01:14.658 --> 01:17.077
to, like, compose myself?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.746
- Sure, yeah.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.624
- Alone?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.212
- Okay.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.673
Sure.
- Thanks, girl.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.771
- Goddamn it.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.442
- Okay, I'm ready!

01:48.525 --> 01:50.444
-Okay, let's do it.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.404
- Come on.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.835
- Hey, phone...

02:06.919 --> 02:08.837
...play "Doll Parts" by Hole.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.821
Here we go!

03:43.682 --> 03:45.893
Oh, fuck.
- Uh-oh.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.854
Ow!
- Babe, you okay?

03:48.937 --> 03:50.814
I came home as soon as I got your text.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.774
- What text?

03:52.858 --> 03:56.278
- Uh, "911. Come home ASAP.
Emergency, hunk."

03:57.946 --> 04:01.116
- Oh, you little shit.
- Oopsie.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.369
- What's going on?

04:05.913 --> 04:08.040
- Um...

04:08.123 --> 04:10.250
- What's wrong with you?

04:10.334 --> 04:12.920
-She's crazy, Dan, I tried to tell her.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.338
- So much.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.048
-I have a sex doll.

04:16.131 --> 04:17.674
You said it didn't bother you.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.093
I asked you to respect my privacy,

04:20.177 --> 04:22.095
that I didn't want you to look at it,
and you agreed to that.

04:22.179 --> 04:26.058
You didn't have to,
but you agreed to that.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.310
And now it's sitting in your fucking car.
- Yeah.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.812
- How can I ever trust you again?

04:30.896 --> 04:32.606
- Uh, yeah, I know, I know,

04:32.689 --> 04:35.275
and, um,
there's nothing I can say to fix this,

04:35.359 --> 04:36.944
so I'm just gonna go inside,
and I'll grab my stuff,

04:37.027 --> 04:38.737
and then I'm gonna leave you alone,
and I'm sorry,

04:38.820 --> 04:40.197
I just needed to, like, see her.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.242
- Why?
- Um...

04:43.325 --> 04:44.701
I don't know.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.829
Um, 'cause I'm, like, a crazy psycho,
I guess.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.040
Um, and I just, like, needed to know,

04:50.123 --> 04:53.544
like, what you wanted or what... I...

04:53.627 --> 04:55.212
And I looked and I broke her,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.548
and then I, like,
googled a place to get her fixed,

04:57.631 --> 04:59.591
and I thought I could beat you home, but,

04:59.675 --> 05:01.176
like, subconsciously, obviously,

05:01.260 --> 05:04.555
I wanted to get caught
because I texted you, so,

05:04.638 --> 05:07.015
uh, I don't know.
I'm the worst, and I'm a psycho,

05:07.099 --> 05:08.600
and I probably shouldn't be with you,

05:08.684 --> 05:10.477
and I shouldn't be with anybody,
so I'll just leave,

05:10.561 --> 05:12.771
and you guys will be, like,
great together. It'll be great.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.189
- No, it-- Whoa. Hey...

05:16.441 --> 05:19.319
You went through all that trouble
to get it fixed?

05:19.403 --> 05:22.489
- Yeah. Well, I broke her, so...
- Hey.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.158
That thing's just a masturbation tool.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.785
I don't give a shit about it.

05:26.869 --> 05:30.247
I care about you.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
You're my baby, Bean.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.710
You're the best girlfriend
in the whole world,

05:34.793 --> 05:36.879
and I can never lose you.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.965
- What are you doing?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.801
- What I should've done
a long time ago.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.524
- Dan, no.
No, no, no, you're just really confused.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.942
You're really confused, and this is not

05:59.026 --> 06:00.694
how this is supposed to go.
- No more lies.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.904
- No more lies.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.280
- Wait, Codes, don't go!

06:03.363 --> 06:04.990
This is exactly what the patriarchy wants,

06:05.073 --> 06:07.117
don't you get it?
- We could get chili from that one place.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.786
- You can't eat chili.
It's got beans in it, and you're a bean.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.455
- I'm a canni-bean!

06:11.538 --> 06:14.583
- You guys sound like fucking idiots!

06:14.666 --> 06:17.586
This isn't over!
