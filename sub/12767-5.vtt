HOW LONG DOES SHE HAVE?
A YEAR OR TWO.

10:01.959 --> 10:05.625
AND WHAT THEN?
ADDISON, YOU DON'T KNOW
THIS GIRL OR THIS FAMILY. WE DO.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.959
JENNA WAS ONE OF
MY FIRST PATIENTS.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.417
CUTEST KID--EVERY APPOINTMENT,
SHE'D BRING A DOLL WITH HER,

10:10.458 --> 10:13.625
AND WHATEVER BOO-BOO SHE'D HAVE,
SHE'D PUT IT ON THIS DOLL,

10:13.667 --> 10:16.041
AND SHE WANTED TO MOTHER IT.
SHE DOESN'T NEED
A LIVING DOLL.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.083
SHE NEEDS TO BE LIVING
WHAT LIFE SHE HAS LEFT,

10:18.125 --> 10:21.250
MAKING THE MOST OF IT.
WELL, FOR HER AND HER FAMILY,

10:21.291 --> 10:23.458
"THE MOST OF IT"
IS HAVING A CHILD.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.917
VIOLET HAS SEEN JENNA'S PARENTS
THROUGH THIS ENTIRE PROCESS.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.750
AND THEY WENT FROM WATCHING
THEIR ONLY CHILD DIE TO HOPE.

10:29.792 --> 10:32.041
AREN'T WE, IN EFFECT,
CREATING AN ORPHAN?

10:32.083 --> 10:34.709
JENNA HAS PARENTS
AND A HUSBAND WHO LOVES HER.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.875
MAYBE IT'S YOUNG LOVE,
BUT IT'S REAL.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.542
IS SHE EVEN STRONG ENOUGH
TO CARRY A BABY?

10:39.583 --> 10:42.542
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT WE'D
BE DOING THIS IF SHE WASN'T?
I THINK THAT YOU ALL
LOVE THIS GIRL.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.166
I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.959
IS--IS THIS WHAT IT'S GONNA
BE LIKE WITH YOU IN CHARGE,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.041
QUESTIONING DECISIONS
WE'VE ALREADY MADE?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.500
BECAUSE WE ALL TALKED ABOUT
THIS CASE LAST YEAR,

10:52.542 --> 10:55.959
AND WE DECIDED THAT IF SHE
COULD GET THROUGH CHEMO

10:56.000 --> 10:58.709
AND IF SHE WERE STRONG ENOUGH...
WAIT, THERE'S A HEALTHY EGG.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.208
I'M GONNA GRAB SOME MORE.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.500
I'M GONNA GET NICK
INTO THE DONATION ROOM.

11:03.542 --> 11:07.083
ALL RIGHT, IN 24 HOURS,
SHE COULD BE PREGNANT.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.041
ADDISON.

11:09.083 --> 11:10.583
HEY, ADDISON.

11:10.625 --> 11:12.583
(exhales deeply)
NAOMI WAS MAKING A DIG AT ME.

11:12.625 --> 11:14.583
I MEAN, WHAT,
JUST BECAUSE, WHAT,

11:14.625 --> 11:17.000
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
AS LONG AS THE REST OF YOU--

11:17.041 --> 11:19.625
NAOMI IS JUST BEING PROTECTIVE
OF JENNA. WE ALL ARE.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.291
LOOK, MAYBE FROM THE OUTSIDE,
IT SEEMS CRAZY,

11:22.333 --> 11:25.083
BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH
WITH THIS GIRL--

11:25.125 --> 11:26.542
NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.834
SAM AND COOPER GOT HER
THE BEST ONCOLOGIST.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.834
SHE DID RADIATION, CHEMO,
BONE MARROW.

11:30.875 --> 11:34.792
I THREW THE KITCHEN SINK OF
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS AT HER.

11:34.834 --> 11:36.625
SHE'S DYING.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.792
BUT SHE IS HOLDING ON
FOR THIS.

11:39.834 --> 11:41.041
(sighs)

11:41.083 --> 11:43.041
NAOMI WAS NOT MAKING A DIG.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.792
IT FELT LIKE A DIG.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.875
SHE'S TRYING.

11:46.917 --> 11:50.959
JUST...
LEAVE THE JENNA THING ALONE.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.458
(Dell) DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

11:53.500 --> 11:56.667
HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE OWED
IN OVERDUE ACCOUNTS?
HOW MUCH?

11:56.709 --> 11:58.458
$142,000.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.792
THAT IS GREAT.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.709
THAT... THAT IS REAL MONEY.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.709
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET
A COLLECTION AGENCY ON IT?

12:05.750 --> 12:07.709
WHAT, AND GIVE THEM
A HUGE CUT? NO.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.083
YOU HAVE THE LEDGER.
YOU CALL 'EM.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.041
I NEED AN ENFORCER, DELL,

12:12.083 --> 12:15.041
SOMEONE TO CALL THE PATIENTS,
MOTIVATE THEM TO PAY UP.

12:15.083 --> 12:17.000
AN ENFORCER?

12:17.041 --> 12:19.083
ENFORCER.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.834
ARE YOU BUSY?
ACTUALLY, I'M WAITING
FOR SOMEBODY, BUT--

12:24.875 --> 12:27.041
SO MY FRIEND ASKED ME TO DO
SOMETHING TERRIBLE,

12:27.083 --> 12:28.792
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD DO IT.

12:28.834 --> 12:31.417
WELL, IN FACT, I KNOW
I SHOULDN'T DO IT,

12:31.458 --> 12:34.750
BUT IT'S A FRIEND.
WAIT. BY "FRIEND,"
DO YOU MEAN GUY?

12:34.792 --> 12:38.041
AND BY "SOMETHING TERRIBLE,"
DO YOU MEAN SOMETHING ANAL?
COOPER, IT--IT'S KARA WEI.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.542
SHE ASKED ME TO DESTROY
HER MEDICAL RECORDS.
KARA WEI--THE KARA WEI?

12:40.583 --> 12:42.875
THAT'S YOUR FRIEND
YOU WENT TO SEE THIS MORNING?

12:42.917 --> 12:45.500
YEAH. IT'S FROM COLLEGE.
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

12:45.542 --> 12:48.709
LOOK, SHE'S NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND
IF SHE WANTS YOU TO DESTROY

12:48.750 --> 12:50.458
HER MEDICAL RECORDS.
WELL, THERE WAS A TIME

12:50.500 --> 12:52.625
WE WOULD'VE DONE ANYTHING
FOR EACH OTHER.

12:52.667 --> 12:55.667
YOU KNOW, I WENT THROUGH
SOME VERY BAD TIMES,

12:55.709 --> 12:57.625
AND SHE WAS THERE FOR ME.
SO YOU SHOULD PUT
YOUR CAREER AT RISK?

12:57.667 --> 13:00.417
I OWE HER.
SHE'S NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND.
I AM.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.917
YOU WERE.
MY HAVING CHARLOTTE DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ME.

13:02.959 --> 13:05.041
(laughs)
AND YOU CANNOT DO THIS.

13:05.083 --> 13:08.000
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER WHAT
YOU'VE TOLD ME A MILLION TIMES.
STOP SLEEPING WITH SKANKS?

13:08.041 --> 13:10.250
(Charlotte)
I'LL LET THAT PASS.
OH, I DIDN'T MEAN--

13:10.291 --> 13:13.417
I'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR.
LET'S DO THIS.
WE'LL TALK LATER.

13:15.625 --> 13:19.166
YEAH. RIGHT.

13:19.208 --> 13:20.667
LOOK AT YOUR CALENDAR.

13:20.709 --> 13:22.166
(laughs) OKAY.

13:22.208 --> 13:24.041
HI.
HI.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.583
YOU KNOW, ABOUT THIS MORNING,

13:25.625 --> 13:27.583
WE SHOULD, UH,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK.

13:27.625 --> 13:31.500
WE SHOULD, ABSOLUTELY.

13:31.542 --> 13:33.041
LATER.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.000
RIGHT? OKAY.

13:36.792 --> 13:37.917
HEY.

13:37.959 --> 13:41.417
HEY.
I COULD HAVE A JULY BABY.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.750
THAT'S A GOOD MONTH.
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER, RIGHT?

13:43.792 --> 13:46.417
MAYA. SHE'S A FEW YEARS
YOUNGER THAN YOU.

13:46.458 --> 13:50.291
IT'S THE BEST THING, HUH,
BEING A PARENT?
YEAH, IT IS.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.709
IT FEELS LIKE THE ONLY THING
I'VE EVER WANTED--TO BE A MOM.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.208
YOU ARE SO AHEAD OF THE GAME

13:56.250 --> 13:59.500
TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
SO CLEARLY AND TO GO FOR IT.

13:59.542 --> 14:03.750
MOST PEOPLE, THEY PUT IT OFF
OR MAKE EXCUSES.

14:03.792 --> 14:07.125
MAYBE YOU DON'T GET
THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW GOOD,

14:07.166 --> 14:09.208
HOW PRECIOUS LIFE IS
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE?

14:09.250 --> 14:13.000
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY LIFE
YOU HAVE, RIGHT?

14:13.041 --> 14:15.792
YEAH.

14:23.625 --> 14:25.041
WHOA!
OH!

14:25.083 --> 14:27.041
OH, MY GOSH. I'M SO SORRY.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.667
OH, IT'S--NO, IT'S FINE.

14:28.709 --> 14:32.250
THE BASKET'S OVER THERE
ON THE CART, FOR YOUR CUP.
OH. UH, THANKS.

14:32.291 --> 14:34.667
UH, ARE YOU JENNA'S HUSBAND?
YEAH, NICK.

14:34.709 --> 14:37.000
I'M DR. MONTGOMERY. ADDISON.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.000
(woman moaning)

14:39.041 --> 14:41.041
OH, THE, UH--I COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN IT OFF.

14:41.083 --> 14:43.458
DON'T WORRY. I'VE GOT IT.
(chuckles)

14:43.500 --> 14:46.542
(moaning continues)

14:46.583 --> 14:48.000
(moaning stops)

14:51.083 --> 14:53.583
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:53.625 --> 14:56.834
YEAH, I'M SORRY. IT'S ALL
JUST A LITTLE... WEIRD.

14:56.875 --> 14:59.500
I MEAN, MOST OF THE TEAM WENT
OUT FOR PIZZA AFTER PRACTICE.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.709
I CAME TO GET JENNA PREGNANT.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.875
YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE, UH,

15:03.917 --> 15:06.291
DEALING
WITH COLLEGE APPLICATIONS

15:06.333 --> 15:08.667
AND MAKING YOUR PARENTS
FREAK OUT OVER WILD PARTIES.

15:08.709 --> 15:11.625
WELL, I MEAN, PARENTS AREN'T
REALLY IN THE PICTURE.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.667
UH, LYNN AND GARRY--
JENNA'S PARENTS--

15:13.709 --> 15:15.208
THEY TOOK ME IN.

15:15.250 --> 15:18.208
WE'VE BEEN DATING SO LONG, I WAS
ALREADY PART OF THE FAMILY,

15:18.250 --> 15:20.709
SO IT WORKS.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.750
CAN I ASK YOU...

15:23.792 --> 15:26.083
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER?

15:26.125 --> 15:29.834
AFTER?
WHEN I WAS 17, I COULDN'T
HAVE DONE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.709
HAVE YOU THOUGHT THIS THROUGH?
ARE YOU GOING TO COLLEGE?

15:32.750 --> 15:34.709
WELL, UH,
I WANT TO GO TO U-PENN,

15:34.750 --> 15:37.125
AND MY GUIDANCE COUNSELOR THINKS
I CAN GET A SCHOLARSHIP.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.750
THAT'S GREAT. SO THEN WILL YOU
BRING THE BABY WITH YOU,

15:39.792 --> 15:41.667
OR WILL JENNA'S PARENTS
RAISE THE BABY?

15:41.709 --> 15:44.417
I MEAN,
HOW WILL YOU BE INVOLVED?

15:44.458 --> 15:46.333
WILL YOU FLY HOME WEEKENDS
OR HOLIDAYS?

15:46.375 --> 15:49.041
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SHE'S 10 OR 15

15:49.083 --> 15:51.041
AND SHE ASKS WHY HER FATHER
DIDN'T RAISE HER?

15:51.083 --> 15:53.792
WELL, GARRY AND LYNN
WANT TO BE PARENTS AGAIN,

15:53.834 --> 15:56.041
AND JENNA WANTS A BABY, SO...

15:56.083 --> 15:58.041
YOU ARE GONNA BE
THE FATHER, NICK.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.250
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:02.208 --> 16:04.166
NO, I WON'T CALL BACK AGAIN.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.166
WE'VE SENT YOU THIS BILL
THREE TIMES,

16:06.208 --> 16:08.166
AND WE NEED YOU TO PAY IT.

16:08.208 --> 16:11.166
IT WOULDN'T HAVE HURT
SO MUCH IF YOU DIDN'T TENSE UP.

16:11.208 --> 16:13.667
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
SO AFRAID OF NEEDLES.

16:13.709 --> 16:15.458
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.750
IF YOU TELL ANYONE,
NO CORNFIELD FOR YOU.
OH, THERE WILL BE CORNFIELD.

16:18.792 --> 16:21.458
HOW'D THE JOB INTERVIEW GO?
OKAY.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
IT'S NOT OUT OF STATE
OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

16:23.542 --> 16:25.041
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE?

16:25.083 --> 16:27.917
I JUST TOOK AN H.I.V. TEST FOR
YOU. WHY WOULD I GO ANYWHERE?

16:27.959 --> 16:29.417
(elevator bell dings)

16:29.458 --> 16:30.417
SO...

16:30.458 --> 16:31.917
IT'S BUSINESS, COOP.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.500
LET'S FOCUS ON PLEASURE.

16:33.542 --> 16:36.000
(whispers) CORNFIELD.

16:37.583 --> 16:42.208
(Naomi) I AM INJECTING
A SINGLE SPERM INTO YOUR EGG.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.709
SHE'S MAKING YOUR BABY,
SWEETIE.

16:44.750 --> 16:47.041
(gasps) LOOK AT THAT.
OUR GRANDCHILD.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.041
NOW OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS,

16:49.083 --> 16:52.750
THE CELLS WILL DIVIDE
AND MULTIPLY TO FORM AN EMBRYO.

16:52.792 --> 16:55.542
THAT'S MY BABY.
UM, TAKE A PICTURE.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.041
TAKE A PICTURE OF US
FOR THE ALBUM.

16:58.083 --> 17:01.667
SURE. OKAY, NICK, GET IN THERE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE A DAD.

17:03.709 --> 17:05.625
NICK?

17:05.667 --> 17:07.667
I'M SORRY.

17:07.709 --> 17:10.625
YOU'VE BEEN SO GOOD TO ME.
YOU ALL HAVE, BUT...
NICKY.

17:10.667 --> 17:13.041
I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

17:13.083 --> 17:15.875
I DON'T WANT A BABY.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.208
ALL RIGHT, WHAT WOULD BE
ON YOUR LIST

17:26.250 --> 17:28.208
OF THINGS TO DO
BEFORE YOU DIE, COOP?

17:28.250 --> 17:31.208
AM I DYING? DID YOU GET
MY TEST RESULTS FROM DELL?
NO. WHAT--

17:31.250 --> 17:34.250
NICK, PLEASE COME OUT.
I REALLY WANT THIS BABY.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.709
(Nick)
WE'VE BARELY HAD SEX.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.709
BABIES ARE SUPPOSED TO COME
FROM SEX.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.875
(Jenna)
MY PARENTS CAN HEAR YOU.
(Garry) IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

17:40.917 --> 17:43.041
NICK, I MEAN IT.
YOU PROMISED.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.041
THIS IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.
IT'S FERTILITY STRESS.

17:45.083 --> 17:47.458
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
(Pete) I GOT THE KEY.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.667
NICK? I'M COMING IN.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.667
OKAY.

17:53.834 --> 17:57.291
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU WANTED THIS.

17:57.333 --> 18:01.166
YOU WANTED THIS.
THEY WANTED THIS.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.667
BUT LIKE SHE SAID...

18:03.709 --> 18:06.041
WHAT ABOUT WHAT I WANT?

18:08.917 --> 18:11.041
FINE. GO.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.875
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.125
NO, I'LL DO IT WITHOUT HIM.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.917
I'M SORRY,

18:16.959 --> 18:20.041
BUT WE CAN'T USE HIS SPERM
WITHOUT HIS CONSENT.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.041
THAT FERTILIZED EGG
CAN'T BE IMPLANTED.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.041
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.083
NO, I NEED THIS BABY.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.041
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

18:28.083 --> 18:31.208
COME ON. LET'S GO SIT DOWN.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.125
(exhales deeply)

18:33.166 --> 18:36.917
HE WAS SCARED. WE WERE TALKING.
HE HAD RESERVATIONS.

18:36.959 --> 18:38.959
NO, YOU DIDN'T APPROVE
OF WHAT WE WERE DOING,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.709
AND SO YOU SABOTAGED IT.
HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO.
I WAS BEING A GOOD DOCTOR.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.750
DO YOU WANT TO PICK UP
THE PIECES OF THAT GIRL NOW?

18:48.375 --> 18:50.750
I TOLD YOU TO BACK OFF.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.583
I COULD USE YOU
ON MY CAMPAIGN.
(laughs)

18:55.625 --> 18:58.250
CONSULTANT
FOR MY HEALTH CARE POLICY--

18:58.291 --> 18:59.875
AFFORDABLE COVERAGE
FOR EVERYONE,

18:59.917 --> 19:02.166
INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH.
I HAVE HEARD
YOUR STUMP SPEECH.

19:02.208 --> 19:05.041
THAT IS NOT
WHY I ASKED TO SEE YOU.

19:05.083 --> 19:08.458
WELL, IT MAY BE A STUMP SPEECH,
BUT I BELIEVE IN IT.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.542
I CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER, VI.
WHICH IS WHY I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD HIDE FROM YOUR PAST.

19:11.583 --> 19:15.291
I'M NOT HIDING.
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE
TO DO GOOD,

19:15.333 --> 19:18.291
TO EMBRACE WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, TO GO PUBLIC.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.000
IS THAT WHAT YOU DID?

19:20.041 --> 19:21.959
WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.041
IS IT? THIS IS SOMETHING FROM
MY PAST I WANT KEPT PERSONAL.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.083
MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.041
NEITHER IS RAPE,

19:30.083 --> 19:32.709
BUT YOU CHOSE TO BURY IT.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.959
AND I HELD YOUR HAND
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.542
I KNOW.

19:41.083 --> 19:43.917
I KNOW YOU WERE THERE
FOR ME.

19:43.959 --> 19:47.250
BUT BURYING THIS...
IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.750
HIDING A SECRET,
WALKING AROUND WORRIED ABOUT

19:49.792 --> 19:52.250
WHEN THE OTHER SHOE IS GONNA
DROP, IT'S GONNA EAT YOU UP.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.834
AND I AM NOT TALKING
ABOUT KARA WEI,

19:54.875 --> 19:56.583
THE CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE.

19:56.625 --> 19:59.750
I'M TALKING ABOUT KARA,
MY FRIEND.
YOU CAN STOP IT NOW, VIOLET.

19:59.792 --> 20:02.250
WHEN--WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
AND YOUR MOTHER HAD JUST DIED

20:02.291 --> 20:04.750
AND YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT
AND YOU BURIED IT,

20:04.792 --> 20:06.250
IT ALMOST DID YOU IN

20:06.291 --> 20:08.250
UNTIL YOU OPENED UP TO ME,

20:08.291 --> 20:10.250
AND THEN YOU GOT HELP.

20:10.291 --> 20:13.250
AND THEN I OPENED UP TO YOU
AND I LEARNED THE SAME LESSON.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.417
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
NO, NO, IT'S NOT.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.875
YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE
IN A POSITION OF POWER.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.583
THINK HOW MANY PEOPLE
YOU COULD HELP

20:20.625 --> 20:23.250
IF THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS OKAY
TO TALK ABOUT--

20:23.291 --> 20:25.250
I HAVE PLENTY OF PEOPLE I HELP.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.792
HELL, I'M SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE
WHO WANT MY HELP.
I--

20:27.834 --> 20:31.041
I CAME TO YOU BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD HELP ME.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.750
I THOUGHT WE DID THAT
FOR EACH OTHER.

20:40.750 --> 20:43.834
HEY, DID YOU GET MY PATIENTS'
BLOOD WORK BACK FROM THE LAB?

20:43.875 --> 20:47.250
UH, NOT TILL TOMORROW.
THESE ARE RAPID BLOOD TESTS!

20:47.291 --> 20:50.792
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE
BEFORE I DIE, SAM?

20:50.834 --> 20:53.250
I WOULD LIKE A LAB THAT
DELIVERS TEST RESULTS ON TIME.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.750
WAIT. THAT WASN'T THE POINT
OF MY QUESTION.

20:55.792 --> 20:58.041
IT'S ABOUT LIFE.
IT'S ABOUT LIVING.

20:58.083 --> 21:01.125
I SAT THERE TODAY
WITH A GIRL WHO'S DYING,

21:01.166 --> 21:04.041
WHO'S NOT AFRAID TO LIVE.
AND ME--
THIS IS ABOUT NAOMI.

21:04.083 --> 21:06.041
YES.
I SHOOK UP MY WHOLE WORLD

21:06.083 --> 21:08.041
BECAUSE I FELT I HADN'T
BEEN LIVING, ALL RIGHT?

21:08.083 --> 21:10.458
AND WHAT DO I DO? NOTHING.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.458
NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER WITH NAOMI

21:13.500 --> 21:15.458
WITHOUT EVER... YOU KNOW,
STEPPING OFF A CLIFF.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.834
YOU WANT TO STEP OFF
A CLIFF?

21:17.875 --> 21:21.041
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING BIG.
WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

21:21.083 --> 21:24.667
GET READY TO STEP OFF
THE CLIFF, MY FRIEND.

21:24.709 --> 21:26.250
(grunts)

21:26.291 --> 21:28.750
OKAY.

21:28.792 --> 21:29.917
AH.

21:29.959 --> 21:32.041
OH.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.333
OKAY.

21:38.959 --> 21:41.041
YEAH, THAT'S BADASS,
ISN'T IT?

21:41.083 --> 21:42.709
YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.125
YOU'VE CROSSED
THE SAME THRESHOLD

21:44.166 --> 21:46.166
AS EVERY 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL
IN AMERICA.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.875
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

21:47.917 --> 21:50.750
OH, WOW.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.041
THAT'S AWFUL.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.709
(woman crying)

21:53.750 --> 21:55.291
WHEN DID HE LEAVE YOU?

21:55.333 --> 21:57.875
THAT'S FINE.
YOU JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

21:57.917 --> 21:58.875
OKAY.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.542
(clears throat)

22:00.583 --> 22:03.750
I'M DONE. YOU KNOW THE ECONOMY
IS REALLY BAD, RIGHT?

22:03.792 --> 22:05.542
PEOPLE ARE HURTING.
DELL--

22:05.583 --> 22:08.542
I CAME BACK TO BE A MIDWIFE,
TO DO LESS ADMINISTRATION.

22:08.583 --> 22:11.041
AND WHEN WE DIG OUT
OF THE HOLE, YOU WILL.

22:11.083 --> 22:14.959
RIGHT NOW EVERYONE IS
TAKING ON EXTRA DUTY.
THEY'RE DOING MORE MEDICINE.
I'M A BILL COLLECTOR.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.500
WE NEED A BILL COLLECTOR
OR THE REST OF THE MONEY.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.166
WHAT?

22:21.208 --> 22:23.166
YOU KNOW SOMETHING.
DELL?

22:23.208 --> 22:25.792
NO, I-I DON'T.
DELL.

22:25.834 --> 22:27.375
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

22:27.417 --> 22:30.041
WILLIAM DELL PARKER.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.792
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

22:31.834 --> 22:34.834
WE HAVE BEEN KILLING OURSELVES
TRYING TO SAVE THIS PRACTICE,

22:34.875 --> 22:37.834
AND YOU HAVE 10,000 SQUARE FEET

22:37.875 --> 22:40.959
OF PRIME OFFICE SPACE
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.041
IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE
AS IT SOUNDS.

22:43.083 --> 22:45.041
THEN MAKE ME UNDERSTAND, NAI.

22:45.083 --> 22:47.458
THE PRACTICE
IS AT STAKE HERE.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.000
THIS IS THE PRACTICE.
THIS WAS OUR FIRST SPACE--

22:50.041 --> 22:51.542
MINE AND SAM'S.

22:51.583 --> 22:53.792
MAYA... (laughs) MAYA LEARNED
HOW TO WALK HERE.

22:53.834 --> 22:57.792
AND WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO CREATE A MEDICAL SANCTUARY.

22:57.834 --> 23:01.291
ADDISON, LOOK--CARDIOLOGISTS,
SURGICAL SUITES, M.R.I. SUITES,

23:01.333 --> 23:03.417
A DEDICATED LAB.
(elevator bell dings)

23:03.458 --> 23:07.500
THIS WAS THE PRACTICE
WE ALWAYS DREAMED OF.
(Sam) THE PRACTICE
THAT STILL CAN BE.

23:07.542 --> 23:09.500
LOOK, NOW THE ONLY WAY
TO LEASE THIS PLACE

23:09.542 --> 23:11.500
IS WITH A 5-
OR 10-YEAR COMMITMENT,

23:11.542 --> 23:14.041
AND THAT WOULD MEAN GIVING UP
ON OUR FUTURE.

23:14.083 --> 23:16.041
IF WE LEASE IT,
WE CAN PAY OFF OUR DEBT,

23:16.083 --> 23:18.083
OUR CASH FLOW WILL BE WAY UP.

23:18.125 --> 23:21.250
IT'LL ALLOW US TO STAY AFLOAT.
NO--THIS IS AN ISSUE

23:21.291 --> 23:24.875
ON WHICH WE SEE EYE TO EYE.
WE'RE NOT LEASING IT OUT,
ADDISON.

23:24.917 --> 23:27.834
YOU ARE HOLDING ON TO SOMETHING
THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD.

23:27.875 --> 23:31.208
AND ONCE AGAIN, YOU ARE
TRYING TO CONTROL EVERYTHING.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.208
WHAT, IT'S NOT ENOUGH
THAT YOU'VE ALREADY RUINED

23:33.250 --> 23:35.041
THE LAST WISH OF A DYING GIRL--
YOU KNOW WHAT, NAI?
KEEP IT UP.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.458
'CAUSE EVENTUALLY
I'M GONNA STOP CARING

23:36.500 --> 23:39.041
WHETHER OR NOT YOU FORGIVE ME.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.500
AND, SAM, YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS
PLACE, AND YOU KEPT IT FROM ME.

23:41.542 --> 23:43.667
NICE. GREAT.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.500
THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR BACKING ME UP.

23:50.542 --> 23:53.083
WELL, THIS IS OUR FUTURE.
SO...

23:53.125 --> 23:56.041
WHAT THE HELL
IS IN YOUR EAR?

23:56.083 --> 23:59.083
OH. (chuckles) IT'S A, UH,
IT'S A STUD.

23:59.125 --> 24:01.625
YOU KNOW, LIKE HARRISON FORD,
MICHAEL JORDAN. YOU LIKE IT?

24:01.667 --> 24:05.208
WELL... (chuckles) MAYBE
MAYA WILL THINK IT'S HIP.

24:05.250 --> 24:07.041
YEAH. HIP.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.041
SPEAKING OF, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WE COULD COME OVER

24:09.083 --> 24:10.750
TO DINNER TONIGHT, YOU KNOW?

24:10.792 --> 24:13.041
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,
YOU AND I COULD TALK ABOUT US.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.875
OKAY, YEAH.

24:14.917 --> 24:16.041
YEAH?

24:16.083 --> 24:19.041
SURE.
OKAY.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.500
(elevator bell dings)

24:20.542 --> 24:24.375
THE KID'S 17, AND THEY WANT
TO USE HIM AS A BABY FACTORY.

24:24.417 --> 24:27.667
IF IT WAS ME,
I'D RUN AWAY, TOO.

24:27.709 --> 24:30.667
WHY SHOULD THAT BOY
WANT TO BE TIED DOWN?

24:30.709 --> 24:34.041
GREAT. I'M ALREADY DEALING
WITH ONE GIRL WHO'S DYING.

24:34.083 --> 24:36.333
THAT'S SUBTLE.
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HEALTHY.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.333
I'M A SMOKER, PETE.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

24:43.083 --> 24:46.041
THE LAB IS FAST... USUALLY.

24:46.083 --> 24:49.041
NO PREACHER, NO CORNFIELD.

24:49.083 --> 24:51.041
OH, I NEEDED SEX TODAY.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.750
ME, TOO.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.750
VIOLET'S BEING
ALL PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

24:54.792 --> 24:56.750
ADDISON'S AT WAR
WITH SAM AND NAOMI

24:56.792 --> 24:59.041
OVER LEASING A FLOOR
OF THE BUILDING.

24:59.083 --> 25:02.375
WE'RE DOCTORS
FIGHTING OVER LEASES,

25:02.417 --> 25:04.375
THAT'S HOW BROKE WE ARE.

25:04.417 --> 25:05.375
YEAH?

25:05.417 --> 25:07.041
YOU WANT TO...

25:07.083 --> 25:09.125
TELL ME WHY YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR JOBS?

25:09.166 --> 25:11.750
I'M NOT A DOCTOR ANYMORE.

25:11.792 --> 25:14.041
I'M AN ADMINISTRATOR.

25:14.083 --> 25:17.625
I NEED MORE. I NEED... OH.

25:17.667 --> 25:20.208
THE INTERVIEW TODAY
WAS REALLY INTERESTING.

25:20.250 --> 25:23.083
IT WAS...

25:23.125 --> 25:24.875
WHAT?

25:24.917 --> 25:27.750
NEVER MIND.

25:27.792 --> 25:30.041
HEY, WE CAN STILL BE
IN THE CORNFIELD.

25:30.083 --> 25:32.333
COME ON.
FINISH WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.

25:32.375 --> 25:35.625
I'M YOUR FRIEND,
POSSIBLY YOUR BEST FRIEND,

25:35.667 --> 25:38.041
AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE
ANY CONDOMS.
NO NEED.

25:38.083 --> 25:40.458
(sighs)
I'M PURE AS THE DRIVEN SNOW.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.667
I'M
THE "EVERYTHING BUT" GIRL...

25:43.709 --> 25:45.667
WHO'S WAITING FOR MARRIAGE.

25:45.709 --> 25:50.834
AND YOU...
ARE THE HORNY FIELD HAND.

25:50.875 --> 25:55.583
AND WE CAN ONLY USE
OUR TONGUES.

25:55.625 --> 25:59.166
♪♪

25:59.208 --> 26:02.875
SO IF I LEASE THE FOURTH FLOOR,
THEN SAM AND NAOMI HATE ME.

26:02.917 --> 26:05.834
BUT IF DON'T,
THE PRACTICE MAY GO UNDER.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.250
SO YOU LEASE IT, RIGHT?
YOU MAKE IT SOUND EASY.

26:08.291 --> 26:11.250
I LEAD GUYS EVERY DAY.
A LEADER MAKES TOUGH DECISIONS.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.041
SOMETIMES THAT MEANS

26:13.083 --> 26:16.041
PISSING OFF A FRIEND
FOR THE GOOD OF THE GROUP.

26:16.083 --> 26:18.792
OH. I WANT PEOPLE
TO STOP BEING PISSED OFF.

26:18.834 --> 26:21.709
WELL, YOU NEED TO DECIDE
WHO YOU WANT TO BE--

26:21.750 --> 26:23.709
A GOOD FRIEND
OR A GOOD LEADER.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.834
YOU'RE SMART.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.959
YES, YOU DO.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.875
DO YOU WANT ME TO EAT NOODLES
OFF YOUR BACK?

26:30.917 --> 26:32.041
YES.

BACK IN,

26:40.083 --> 26:43.208
I LOVE THE BEACH.
UH, I-I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.

26:43.250 --> 26:45.834
ARE YOU GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER WEDDING?

A LOT TO DISCUSS.

26:54.917 --> 26:57.083
OH, I KNOW.
I'M JUST REALLY EXCITED.

26:57.125 --> 26:59.333

ANSWERING QUESTIONS
THAT YOU DUCKED ALL NIGHT.
WE TALKED.

27:42.166 --> 27:44.375
YEAH, ABOUT ALGEBRA TESTS
AND PIANO LESSONS.

27:44.417 --> 27:47.375
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO TALK
ABOUT US.
I KNOW. I'M SORRY, NAI.

YEAH.
WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR INHALER?

H--DON'T MOCK MY LIST.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.959
"LEARN TO SAIL"?
"DRIVE THROUGH THE BADLANDS"?
YEAH, YEAH.

WHAT--WHAT--IS THIS--
IS THIS A MIDLIFE CRISIS?

28:06.333 --> 28:09.041

GETTING BACK TOGETHER

TO HOP IN A CAR

AS POSSIBLE?
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
THIS IS ABOUT ME.

THE TIMING, IS THAT COINCIDENCE?

A YEAR, SAM.

YOU KNOW, ADDISON,
SHE IS STILL DYING.

THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.
WELL, I'D SAY IT DOES
FOR NICK.

28:54.083 --> 28:57.041
OR DO WE USUALLY ALLOW WIVES
TO PICK OUT SPERM DONORS

28:57.083 --> 29:00.041
WHEN THEIR HUSBANDS
DON'T EVEN WANT KIDS?

29:00.083 --> 29:04.041

IS THE FAMILY WANTS THIS.
HER HUSBAND IS HER FAMILY, TOO.

ABOUT THIS OFFICE SPACE,

41:49.417 --> 41:51.917
I KNEW YOU WERE
THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB.
