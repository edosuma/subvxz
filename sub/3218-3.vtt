WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:05.613
Look, Dad's gone now.
We have to carry out his legacy.

00:05.793 --> 00:09.375
And that means hunting down
as many evil sons of bitches as we can.

00:11.548 --> 00:15.546
Did I die? Did you sell your soul for me?
How long do you get?

00:15.719 --> 00:18.387
- One year.
- You shouldn't have done that.

00:18.554 --> 00:20.760
Guess I gotta save your ass
for a change.

00:23.016 --> 00:27.144
What blade can kill a demon?
I said there was no such thing.

00:27.312 --> 00:30.432
Who was that masked chick?
Ever run across Gordon Walker?

00:30.607 --> 00:33.062
He is dangerous
to everyone and everything around.

00:33.234 --> 00:36.734
This demon tells me they have
soldiers to fight in this coming war.

00:36.905 --> 00:38.529
Humans fighting on hell's side.

00:38.698 --> 00:41.782
I know about Sam's visions.
I know everything.

00:41.951 --> 00:43.860
- And your brother is fair game.
- Aah!

00:54.462 --> 00:56.787
Gordon should be reaching
for the soap for years.

00:56.964 --> 00:58.458
Tell me who you are!

01:01.010 --> 01:03.964
- You're a demon.
- I'm here because I wanna help you.

01:04.138 --> 01:08.052
- What could you possibly...?
- I could help you save your brother.

01:19.069 --> 01:20.894
Lift your arms.

01:22.863 --> 01:24.737
Next.

01:37.710 --> 01:38.908
It's true.

01:39.087 --> 01:40.960
A Devil's Gate was opened
in Wyoming.

01:44.217 --> 01:45.924
Big.

01:47.678 --> 01:50.251
Saint Helena's big.

01:51.264 --> 01:53.589
There's no solid fix
on how many demons got out.

01:53.766 --> 01:55.426
But it's in the hundreds. An army.

01:55.935 --> 01:59.138
Sam Winchester was there, wasn't he?

02:00.690 --> 02:04.058
Talked to a guy who knows a guy
who knows Bobby Singer and yeah.

02:04.235 --> 02:07.853
Looks like the Winchesters were at
ground zero when the gate was popped.

02:08.155 --> 02:10.277
But Singer said they went in there
to stop it.

02:10.449 --> 02:11.611
Mm-mm.

02:11.783 --> 02:15.401
Bobby's edge ain't what it used to be.
Sam could have him believing anything.

02:15.579 --> 02:20.573
Listen, Gordon, as far as talk goes,
Sam Winchester checks out.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.742
- He's a hunter, that's all.
- That's all?

02:26.672 --> 02:28.249
Kubrick...

02:28.423 --> 02:30.083
...I'm not even sure he's human.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.503
Think I'm crazy?

02:33.678 --> 02:36.513
I told you there was a war coming
six months ago.

02:37.056 --> 02:40.176
Take a look around. It's here.

02:40.810 --> 02:44.428
Now I'm telling you
this boy is a part of it.

02:44.689 --> 02:46.064
Track him down, Kubrick.

02:46.983 --> 02:49.473
You'll come to see it too.

02:50.027 --> 02:52.861
Sam Winchester must die.

03:09.002 --> 03:12.206
...you go for the holy water. Don't chat.
- No one was chatting, Dean.

03:12.381 --> 03:14.041
Why didn't you
send her ass back to hell?

03:14.216 --> 03:16.885
Because... Because she said she might
be able to help us out.

03:17.052 --> 03:18.594
How?

03:19.763 --> 03:22.051
No, really, Sam, how?
How could she possibly help us?

03:22.223 --> 03:24.547
She told me she could help you, okay?

03:25.392 --> 03:28.061
Help you out of the Crossroads deal.

03:30.105 --> 03:32.062
What is wrong with you, huh?
She's lying.

03:32.232 --> 03:34.271
You gotta know that, don't you?

03:34.442 --> 03:37.443
She knows what your weakness is.
It's me.

03:38.905 --> 03:40.862
What else did she say?

03:41.908 --> 03:43.568
- Dude?
- Nothing.

03:45.161 --> 03:47.035
Nothing, okay?

03:47.204 --> 03:49.909
Look, I'm not an idiot, Dean.
I'm not talking about trusting her.

03:50.082 --> 03:51.457
I'm talking about using her.

03:52.001 --> 03:55.250
I mean, we're at war, right?
We don't know jack about the enemy.

03:55.420 --> 03:59.038
We don't know where they are,
what they're doing, what they want.

03:59.215 --> 04:02.915
Now, this Ruby girl knows more
than we will ever find out on our own.

04:03.094 --> 04:06.628
Now, yes, it's a risk, I know that,
but we need to take it.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.304
- You're okay, right? Feeling okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

04:10.476 --> 04:11.721
Why are you always asking me?

04:14.813 --> 04:16.769
It's not mine.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.185
Nope.

04:19.901 --> 04:22.024
- Check the compartment. It's Dad's.
- Dad's?

04:22.195 --> 04:25.278
Yes. I keep it charged up
in case any of his old contacts call.

04:31.119 --> 04:32.400
Hello?

04:32.579 --> 04:34.702
Yes, this is Edgar Cayce.

04:36.541 --> 04:40.289
No, no, no. Don't call the police.
I'll handle this myself.

04:40.461 --> 04:44.791
Thanks. You know, can you just, uh...?
Can you just lock it back up for me?

04:44.966 --> 04:47.291
Great. Uh, I...

04:47.468 --> 04:48.927
I don't have my book
in front of me.

04:49.095 --> 04:51.467
Do you...?
Do you have the address so I...?

04:51.639 --> 04:54.260
Sure. Okay. Go ahead.

04:56.142 --> 04:58.715
Right. Thanks a lot.

05:00.479 --> 05:02.686
Dad kept a container
at a storage place?

05:02.857 --> 05:04.980
- What?
- Outside of Buffalo?

05:05.151 --> 05:08.235
- No way.
- Yeah. And someone just broke into it.

05:23.293 --> 05:25.617
So you got no hard evidence
on this Winchester guy?

05:25.794 --> 05:28.119
You're just working off
Gordon's instincts.

05:28.297 --> 05:31.547
- You ever hunt with Gordon?
- No. I heard he's good.

05:31.716 --> 05:33.839
Good? Ha, ha.

05:34.010 --> 05:37.011
He's the best. Saved my ass
more times than I can count.

05:37.180 --> 05:40.928
So if he says Sam Winchester
is dangerous, I believe him.

05:41.100 --> 05:44.137
He's gonna be covering his tracks.
Won't be easy to find.

05:44.312 --> 05:47.182
Last I got, puts him in Nebraska
three weeks back.

05:47.356 --> 05:50.772
- Not exactly a fresh lead.
- He ain't invisible, Creedy.

05:50.943 --> 05:53.315
Some hunter out there
knows something.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.858
So we start calling our contacts.

05:56.030 --> 05:58.604
All we need is one break.

06:12.421 --> 06:14.295
Don't play with my Jesus.

06:19.469 --> 06:21.129
Man.

06:21.847 --> 06:23.257
What?

06:23.431 --> 06:25.922
Just Dad.
You know, him and his secrets.

06:26.101 --> 06:28.887
Spend all this time with the guy,
we barely even know the man.

06:29.061 --> 06:31.896
Well, we're about to learn something.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.448
No demons allowed.

06:50.873 --> 06:52.415
Blood.

06:55.669 --> 06:57.661
Check this out.

07:05.344 --> 07:08.262
Whoever broke in here got tagged.

07:09.682 --> 07:11.674
Dear old Dad.

07:12.559 --> 07:15.975
I got two sets of boot treads here.
Looks like it was a two-man job.

07:16.605 --> 07:20.437
And our friend with the buckshot in him,
looks like he kept walking.

07:21.443 --> 07:24.859
So, what's the deal?
Dad would do work here or something?

07:25.030 --> 07:27.899
Living the high life, as usual.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.630
1995.
No way.

07:49.468 --> 07:53.300
That's my division championship
soccer trophy.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.466
I can't believe he kept this.

07:55.641 --> 07:59.424
Yes. Probably the closest you ever came
to being a boy.

08:00.478 --> 08:02.684
Oh, wow.

08:05.524 --> 08:08.442
It's my first sawed-off.
I made it myself.

08:08.611 --> 08:10.603
Sixth grade.

08:27.128 --> 08:28.753
Holy crap.

08:31.381 --> 08:33.919
Look at this, he had land mines.

08:34.467 --> 08:36.506
Which they didn't take.

08:37.761 --> 08:39.671
Or the guns.

08:40.682 --> 08:43.173
I guess they knew
what they were after, huh?

08:46.396 --> 08:48.518
Hey, Dean, check this out.

08:48.773 --> 08:50.896
See these symbols?

08:51.067 --> 08:52.858
That's binding magic.

08:54.153 --> 08:55.813
These are curse boxes.

08:55.988 --> 08:59.771
Curse boxes. Supposed to keep
the evil mojo in like the Pandora deal.

08:59.949 --> 09:02.618
Yeah. They're built to contain the power
of the cursed object.

09:02.785 --> 09:05.276
Dad's journal did mention
a whole bunch of stuff, you know?

09:05.454 --> 09:08.906
Dangerous hexed items, fetishes.
He never did say where they ended up.

09:09.083 --> 09:12.452
Yeah.
Well, this must be his toxic-waste dump.

09:19.718 --> 09:21.841
One box is missing.

09:22.012 --> 09:23.720
Great.

09:23.889 --> 09:25.264
Well, maybe they didn't open it.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.386
Come on, man. Let's open it.
- Shut up about the damn box!

09:28.560 --> 09:33.220
Do you see what's happening here?
I'm literally bleeding to death.

09:33.397 --> 09:35.140
- Uh, I'm gonna open it.
- Grossman.

09:35.315 --> 09:37.106
What if this is really worth something?

09:37.275 --> 09:40.062
What, we should just hand it over
to her?

09:40.236 --> 09:44.400
Hey, we took all the risk.
Hell, Wayne, you got shot.

09:44.574 --> 09:46.566
And all for a lousy
few hundred bucks.

09:46.743 --> 09:51.618
Now, we could make more
selling whatever it is ourselves.

10:10.639 --> 10:11.837
Huh?

10:12.600 --> 10:14.426
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

10:18.063 --> 10:22.357
It's a rabbit's foot.
It's a rabbit's foot, Grossman!

10:23.110 --> 10:24.734
I'm gonna die for a damn rabbit's foot.

10:26.529 --> 10:28.237
Oh, great. Now what?

10:34.619 --> 10:36.695
Oh.

10:37.164 --> 10:38.539
Hey, Foster.

10:38.707 --> 10:42.040
Hey, listen, not to be a drag or nothing,
but it's 6:00 in the morning.

10:42.210 --> 10:45.745
- Can't you keep it down?
- We got a situation here is all. Sorry.

10:45.922 --> 10:49.042
- What the hell happened to you?
- Shotgun happened to me.

10:52.887 --> 10:54.085
- Hey, Grossman.
- Yeah.

10:54.263 --> 10:57.549
Under my sink, there's a medical kit.
And get some water boiling.

10:58.017 --> 10:59.511
Okay.

11:01.186 --> 11:03.392
I used to be an Army medic,
you know, in Nam.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.520
Ha. So I guess this is your lucky day.

11:30.213 --> 11:33.332
Connecticut. Last three digits: 880.

11:33.507 --> 11:35.879
Yup. That's it.

11:36.510 --> 11:40.377
Should've blacked out their plates before
they parked in front of the camera.

11:41.723 --> 11:43.431
Four kings.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.138
- You see that?
- Unbelievable. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:46.978 --> 11:48.935
Deal it up again.

11:51.941 --> 11:53.649
King of hearts?

11:55.278 --> 11:56.440
Ace of hearts.

11:57.279 --> 11:58.359
Royal flush.

11:58.531 --> 12:01.282
Grossman, that's the second royal flush
in eight hands.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.904
Yeah, this is a lot of fun.

12:04.952 --> 12:06.779
I can't lose.

12:06.954 --> 12:10.157
I mean, really, I... I can't lose.

12:10.666 --> 12:14.367
Maybe this thing really works.
You know what I'm saying?

12:14.545 --> 12:17.214
I'll tell you one thing,
no way we're handing it over...

12:17.381 --> 12:20.666
...to that stuck-up bitch now. Not after
all we've been through. Mm-mm.

12:20.842 --> 12:22.918
Let's get out of here.
Let's go have some fun.

12:23.095 --> 12:24.719
Freeze! Freeze! Nobody move!

12:24.888 --> 12:26.168
- Don't move.
- Don't move!

12:26.348 --> 12:28.056
What is this?
- Stop!

12:28.225 --> 12:29.635
All right, give us the box.

12:29.809 --> 12:32.479
- And please tell me that you didn't...
- Oh, they did.

12:35.480 --> 12:36.856
You opened it?

12:37.024 --> 12:38.767
Unh! Are you guys cops, huh?

12:38.942 --> 12:41.314
- Are you guys cops?
- What was in the box?

12:44.072 --> 12:46.859
Oh, is that it, huh? It was, wasn't it?

12:47.033 --> 12:48.575
- What is that thing?
- Aah!

13:00.504 --> 13:02.082
Sorry. Aah!

13:29.864 --> 13:31.904
Dean.

13:32.075 --> 13:33.355
I got it.

13:33.535 --> 13:34.945
No, you don't.

13:44.044 --> 13:45.502
Damn!

13:53.010 --> 13:54.505
Sam!

14:06.689 --> 14:08.812
That was a lucky break.

14:10.026 --> 14:11.271
That a rabbit's foot?

14:13.946 --> 14:15.191
I think it is.

14:16.490 --> 14:18.150
Huh.

14:31.963 --> 14:34.252
I'm not finding anything on it
in Dad's journal.

14:37.592 --> 14:39.466
- Dean, come on.
- What?

14:39.636 --> 14:41.676
Hey, that was my gun he was aiming
at your head.

14:41.847 --> 14:43.969
My gun don't jam,
so that was a lucky break.

14:44.140 --> 14:47.758
Not to mention them taking
themselves out, also a lucky break.

14:48.686 --> 14:50.311
Here. Scratch one.

14:51.230 --> 14:53.104
Come on, Sam. Scratch and win.

14:56.319 --> 14:58.940
Dean, it's gotta be cursed somehow.

14:59.113 --> 15:01.734
Otherwise Dad wouldn't have
locked it up.

15:04.201 --> 15:06.241
Twelve hundred dollars.

15:06.412 --> 15:07.491
You just won $ 1200.

15:08.621 --> 15:11.112
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!

15:11.957 --> 15:14.709
I don't know, man.
Doesn't seem that cursed to me.

15:31.226 --> 15:33.099
Grossman.

15:33.728 --> 15:35.768
Grossman, get up.

15:38.732 --> 15:40.440
Hey.

15:40.609 --> 15:42.151
Grossman, get up.

15:45.322 --> 15:46.780
- Hey.
- Mm.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.263
Hey.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.225
Grossman?

16:26.693 --> 16:28.022
Grossman.

16:47.629 --> 16:49.954
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, man.

16:50.131 --> 16:53.334
<i>- Now, look, Bobby, we didn't know.
You touched it? Damn it, Sam.</i>

16:53.509 --> 16:55.585
Well, Dad never told us
about this thing.

16:55.762 --> 16:57.801
I mean, you knew about his storage
in Black Rock?

16:57.972 --> 17:01.388
His lockup? Yeah, I knew.
Hell, I built those curse boxes for him.

17:01.559 --> 17:04.678
<i>Listen, you have got
a serious problem.</i>

17:04.854 --> 17:07.854
That rabbit's foot
ain't no dime-store notion.

17:08.523 --> 17:11.559
<i>- It's real Hoodoo. Old World stuff.
- Awesome.</i>

17:11.733 --> 17:14.734
Made by a Baton Rouge conjure woman
about a hundred years ago.

17:14.904 --> 17:16.445
It's a hell of a luck charm.

17:16.614 --> 17:20.362
It's not a luck charm. It's a curse.
She made it to kill people, Sam.

17:20.534 --> 17:23.819
<i>See, you touch it, you own it.</i>

17:23.996 --> 17:27.614
<i>You own it, sure, you get a run
of good luck to beat the devil.</i>

17:27.790 --> 17:31.124
But you lose it, that luck turns.

17:31.294 --> 17:33.832
It turns so bad
that you're dead inside a week.

17:34.005 --> 17:36.923
- Well, so I won't lose it, Bobby.
- Everybody loses it.

17:37.091 --> 17:39.464
Well, then how do we break the curse?

17:39.636 --> 17:40.964
I don't know if you can.

17:42.179 --> 17:45.132
<i>Let me look through my library
and make some calls.</i>

17:46.141 --> 17:48.429
Just sit tight.

17:50.186 --> 17:54.515
Dude, we're up 15 grand.

18:01.030 --> 18:03.272
Don't worry.
Bobby will find a way to break it.

18:03.449 --> 18:06.948
<i>Until then, I say we hit Vegas,
pull a Rain Man. You can be Rain Man.</i>

18:07.119 --> 18:09.444
Look, we lay low
until Bobby calls back, okay?

18:09.621 --> 18:11.032
Hi, uh, table for two, please?

18:11.206 --> 18:13.114
Congratulations!

18:14.500 --> 18:16.706
- Exciting, I know.
- You are the one millionth guest...

18:16.877 --> 18:18.669
...of the Biggerson's Restaurant family!

18:18.837 --> 18:20.795
Congratulations.

18:27.554 --> 18:30.010
Right.
You hear anything, you give me a call.

18:30.182 --> 18:31.973
Well, that clears my book.

18:32.142 --> 18:34.549
The word's out. Now we wait.

18:35.312 --> 18:36.770
Now we eat.

18:36.938 --> 18:40.022
Good idea. What do you like?
I got canned everything.

18:40.191 --> 18:44.270
No, man. Not eating in the RV.
Look, I know a good place.

18:44.861 --> 18:48.064
Wide menu, good service,
homey atmosphere.

18:48.239 --> 18:50.197
Garlic knots.

18:50.492 --> 18:51.820
Menu's on their website.

18:53.870 --> 18:57.155
Bobby's right.
This lore goes way back.

18:57.331 --> 18:58.494
Pure Hoodoo.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.207
You can't just cut one off any rabbit.

19:01.377 --> 19:05.789
It has to be in a cemetery,
under a full moon, on a Friday the 13th.

19:08.050 --> 19:09.213
I say from now on...

19:09.385 --> 19:11.922
...we only go to places
with Biggerson's.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.304
Can I freshen you up?

19:21.478 --> 19:23.518
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

19:26.275 --> 19:27.817
Thanks.

19:28.777 --> 19:30.355
- Oh.
- Oh.

19:30.529 --> 19:32.735
- Let me wipe up.
- Uh, no worries. That's okay.

19:32.906 --> 19:35.527
- I got it. Uh...
- It's no trouble, really.

19:36.284 --> 19:38.490
- Okay.
- Sorry about that.

19:38.661 --> 19:40.120
- It's all right.
Mm.

19:59.096 --> 20:02.263
Dude, if you were
ever gonna get lucky.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.808
Shut up.

20:07.396 --> 20:08.855
Oh. Oh, jeez. Ah.

20:12.443 --> 20:14.400
Sorry.

20:16.445 --> 20:17.690
How was that good?

20:22.618 --> 20:23.898
Son of a bitch.

20:37.757 --> 20:39.465
Come on.

20:41.302 --> 20:42.631
Whoa!

20:46.389 --> 20:48.596
Wow, you suck.

20:51.269 --> 20:53.096
So, what, now your luck turns bad?

20:55.690 --> 20:57.398
I guess.

20:59.777 --> 21:01.734
Wonder how bad.

21:04.907 --> 21:08.572
Looks good. I like that, when they drop
the whole onion in the fryer.

21:08.744 --> 21:11.579
Nearest location...

21:18.252 --> 21:19.794
You seeing that?

21:24.383 --> 21:26.292
Yes, I am.

21:51.282 --> 21:54.402
Oh, man. What do you want?

21:54.577 --> 21:57.911
Heard about your friend.
That's bad luck.

21:58.998 --> 22:00.492
Piss off.

22:00.666 --> 22:03.240
We know someone hired you
to steal the rabbit's foot.

22:03.419 --> 22:06.171
- A woman.
- Oh, yeah?

22:06.338 --> 22:09.458
- How do you know that?
- Because she just stole it back from us.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.254
Listen, man, this is serio...

22:17.682 --> 22:21.300
- Sam, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good. Uhn.

22:24.313 --> 22:26.389
I want you to tell us her name.

22:27.149 --> 22:28.477
Screw you.

22:30.819 --> 22:33.855
It wasn't a freak accident
that killed your partner.

22:34.030 --> 22:37.115
- What?
- It was the rabbit's foot.

22:38.493 --> 22:39.821
You're crazy, man.

22:40.787 --> 22:43.823
You know I'm not.
You saw what happened, what it did.

22:43.998 --> 22:46.121
All the flukes, all the luck.

22:46.292 --> 22:48.699
When you lose the foot,
that luck goes sour.

22:48.877 --> 22:51.202
That's what killed your friend.

22:52.213 --> 22:54.420
And my brother here is next.

22:54.591 --> 22:57.508
And who knows how many more
innocent people after that.

22:57.677 --> 23:01.627
If you don't help us stop this thing,
that puts those deaths on your head.

23:03.057 --> 23:05.180
Now, I can read people.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.846
And I get it.

23:08.020 --> 23:11.603
You're a thief and a scumbag.
That's fine.

23:11.774 --> 23:13.731
But you're not a killer.

23:13.901 --> 23:15.644
Are you?

23:25.494 --> 23:27.783
No one saw which way they went.

23:27.955 --> 23:30.659
And their meal was free
so there's no credit-card trail.

23:31.667 --> 23:33.374
Don't worry, we'll find him.

23:33.543 --> 23:34.658
What makes you so sure?

23:34.836 --> 23:38.170
Because there's a higher power
at work here.

23:38.340 --> 23:40.747
I know it now.

23:48.558 --> 23:51.130
<i>- Hello?
Dean, great news.</i>

23:51.309 --> 23:55.307
<i>Wasn't easy, but I found a heavyweight
cleansing ritual that should do the trick.</i>

23:55.480 --> 23:58.350
Bobby, that's, uh, great.
Except Sam, uh...

24:00.735 --> 24:02.609
- Sam lost the foot.
- He what?

24:02.779 --> 24:05.732
Bobby, listen. Listen. This, uh...
This hot chick stole it from him.

24:05.906 --> 24:08.113
I'm serious. She was in her mid 20s.

24:08.284 --> 24:11.569
And she was sharp, you know?
Good enough with the con to play us.

24:11.745 --> 24:14.746
She only gave the guy she hired a name,
probably an alias or something.

24:14.915 --> 24:16.706
Luigi or something.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.667
- Lugosi.
- Lugosi.

24:18.835 --> 24:20.032
<i>Lugosi?</i>

24:20.795 --> 24:22.123
Lugos...

24:22.296 --> 24:24.454
Oh, crap. It's probably Bela.

24:27.051 --> 24:28.213
Bela Lugosi? That's cute.

24:28.385 --> 24:29.927
<i>Bela Talbot's her real name.</i>

24:30.095 --> 24:33.594
- Crossed paths with her once or twice.
- She knew about the rabbit's foot.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.841
- Is she a hunter?
- Pretty far from a hunter.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.057
But she knows her way
around the territory.

24:38.228 --> 24:41.644
She's been out of the country.
Last I heard she was in the Middle East.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.273
I guess she's back.

24:43.441 --> 24:45.434
Which means
seriously bad luck for you.

24:46.027 --> 24:49.194
<i>- Great.
- But if it is Bela...</i>

24:49.363 --> 24:51.818
...at least I might know folks
who know where to find her.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.066
Thanks, Bobby. Again.

24:54.242 --> 24:58.287
Just look out for your brother,
you idiot.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.955
- What?
- I lost my shoe.

25:17.681 --> 25:21.594
All right, Bobby, thanks.
Hey, we owe you another one.

25:21.767 --> 25:27.010
Bobby's got it on pretty good authority
that this Bela chick lives in Queens.

25:27.189 --> 25:30.273
So it'll take me about two hours
to get there.

25:30.567 --> 25:33.604
- What are we doing then?
- You, my brother, are staying here...

25:33.779 --> 25:36.614
...because I don't want your bad luck
getting us killed.

25:50.211 --> 25:51.788
What am I even supposed to do, Dean?

25:51.962 --> 25:55.461
Nothing. Nothing. Come here.
I don't want you doing anything.

25:55.632 --> 25:57.755
I want you to sit right here...

25:57.926 --> 26:00.843
...and don't move, okay?
Don't turn on the light.

26:01.012 --> 26:05.092
Don't turn off the light.
Don't even scratch your nose.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.653
Because you shook on 1.5.

26:31.206 --> 26:33.199
Well, maybe I should
just take it somewhere else.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.832
Don't threaten me, Luke.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.876
Despite your reputation,
you don't scare me.

26:45.011 --> 26:48.676
Well, I'm glad you see it that way.
I'll see you at the airstrip in an hour.

27:35.766 --> 27:37.343
You left without your tip.

28:04.584 --> 28:05.663
Oh, come on.

28:07.211 --> 28:09.038
I didn't... I wasn't...

28:54.505 --> 28:55.785
Aah!

29:12.229 --> 29:14.186
You're gonna give it back.

29:14.356 --> 29:18.140
Ha, ha. Sweetie. No, I'm not.

29:18.652 --> 29:24.275
- Yeah, we'll see. Bela, right?
- That's right, Dean.

29:27.118 --> 29:29.157
You know the thing's cursed,
don't you?

29:29.870 --> 29:32.326
You'd be surprised what some people
would pay for that.

29:32.498 --> 29:36.365
- Really?
- There's a lucrative market out there.

29:36.543 --> 29:38.701
A lot of money to be made.

29:40.756 --> 29:43.460
You hunters with all those amulets
and talismans you use...

29:43.633 --> 29:45.293
...to stop those big, bad monsters.

29:45.468 --> 29:48.671
Any one of them could put your
children's children through college.

29:48.847 --> 29:51.337
So you know the truth...

29:51.516 --> 29:55.596
...about what's really going on out there
and this is what you decide to do?

29:56.771 --> 29:58.846
You become a thief?

30:00.148 --> 30:03.065
I procure unique items
for a select clientele.

30:03.234 --> 30:06.603
- Yeah. A thief.
- No.

30:06.779 --> 30:08.819
A great thief.

30:15.788 --> 30:16.986
Oh, he's awake.

30:17.665 --> 30:19.491
Back with us, eh?

30:19.667 --> 30:21.908
Uh, we didn't even have to touch you.

30:22.085 --> 30:25.335
You just went all spastic
and knocked yourself out.

30:25.505 --> 30:27.830
It was like watching Jerry Lewis
ride a stacked chair.

30:28.007 --> 30:29.833
Who are you? What do you wa...?

30:34.054 --> 30:36.343
I used to think
your friend Gordon sent me.

30:37.307 --> 30:38.849
- Gordon? Oh, come on.
Yeah.

30:39.017 --> 30:43.679
Because he asked me to track you down
and put a bullet in your brain.

30:44.522 --> 30:46.314
Great. That sounds like him.

30:46.483 --> 30:50.646
But as it turns out...

30:51.529 --> 30:53.687
...I'm on a mission from God.

30:54.615 --> 30:58.316
Look, Bela, my brother,
he touched the foot.

30:58.493 --> 31:01.114
And when you took it from him,
his luck went from...

31:01.287 --> 31:02.367
I know how it works.

31:02.539 --> 31:04.661
You know he's gonna die
unless we can destroy it.

31:04.832 --> 31:06.077
Oh.

31:08.419 --> 31:10.412
You can have the foot.

31:10.588 --> 31:11.999
For 1.5 million.

31:13.174 --> 31:15.747
Nice. Yeah. I'll just call my banker.

31:17.636 --> 31:19.545
How did you even find
the damn thing?

31:19.722 --> 31:23.553
Stuck in the back of some storage place,
middle of nowhere?

31:27.229 --> 31:30.394
I just asked a few of the ghosts
of the people it had killed.

31:30.564 --> 31:33.518
They were very attuned
into its location.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.776
So you're only out for yourself, huh?
It's all about number one?

31:36.945 --> 31:40.361
Being a hunter
is so much more noble?

31:40.699 --> 31:43.024
Bunch of obsessed,
revenge-driven sociopaths...

31:43.201 --> 31:45.360
...trying to save a world
that can't be saved?

31:45.537 --> 31:47.446
Well, aren't you a glass half full?

31:48.373 --> 31:51.872
We're all going to hell, Dean.
Might as well enjoy the ride.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.712
I actually agree with you there.

31:55.338 --> 31:59.466
Anyhoo, this has been charming,
but, uh, look at the time.

31:59.634 --> 32:01.210
Oh, and this?

32:03.845 --> 32:05.921
You're not the only one
with sticky fingers.

32:06.097 --> 32:09.300
If it's any consolation,
I think you're a truly awful person.

32:23.030 --> 32:24.488
See you.

32:36.333 --> 32:38.824
You were part of that demon plan
to open the gate.

32:39.002 --> 32:42.703
- We did everything we could to stop it.
- Lie, lie, lie.

32:42.881 --> 32:43.996
You were in on it.

32:44.174 --> 32:46.001
You know what their next move is,
don't you?

32:46.176 --> 32:48.714
No, I don't, okay?
You're wrong about all of this.

32:48.887 --> 32:50.511
Where are they gonna hit us next?

32:53.975 --> 32:55.255
Where?

32:59.355 --> 33:01.679
Gordon told me about you, Sam.

33:01.856 --> 33:03.600
About your powers.

33:04.442 --> 33:07.313
You're some kind of weirdo,
psychic freak.

33:07.487 --> 33:10.191
No, not anymore.
I have no powers, no visions.

33:10.364 --> 33:12.274
- Nothing. It's just...
- Lie.

33:13.534 --> 33:17.117
Now, no more lies.

33:17.288 --> 33:21.155
There's an army of demons out there,
pushing at a world already on the brink.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.910
We're on deck for the end game here,
right?

33:25.087 --> 33:28.919
So maybe, just maybe,
you can understand...

33:30.967 --> 33:33.089
...why we can't take chances.
- Whoa, okay.

33:33.260 --> 33:34.802
- Okay, hold on a minute.
- Kubrick...

33:34.970 --> 33:36.963
No. You saw what happened, Creedy.

33:37.139 --> 33:40.721
Ask yourself, why are we here?

33:40.892 --> 33:43.383
Because you saw a picture
on the web?

33:43.562 --> 33:46.681
Because we chose this motel
instead of another?

33:46.856 --> 33:49.015
Luck like that doesn't just happen.

33:49.192 --> 33:51.185
- Look, I can explain all of that if...
- Shut up.

33:52.862 --> 33:56.148
It's God, Creedy.
He led us here for one reason.

33:56.824 --> 33:58.781
To do his work.

33:58.951 --> 34:02.485
- This is destiny.
Whoa.

34:02.662 --> 34:06.327
Nope. No destiny.

34:06.583 --> 34:08.492
Just a rabbit's foot.

34:09.752 --> 34:10.996
Put the gun down, son...

34:11.170 --> 34:13.708
...or you're gonna be scraping brain
off the wall.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.292
Oh, this thing?

34:15.925 --> 34:16.956
Yeah, that thing.

34:18.344 --> 34:19.672
Okay.

34:19.844 --> 34:22.716
But you see, there's something about me
that you don't know.

34:24.558 --> 34:25.803
Yeah, what would that be?

34:26.935 --> 34:28.476
It's my lucky day.

34:30.647 --> 34:33.600
Ha! Oh, my God. Did you see that shot?

34:38.027 --> 34:39.606
I'm amazing.

34:44.951 --> 34:46.576
I'm Batman.

34:48.621 --> 34:51.077
Yeah. You're Batman.

34:58.881 --> 35:00.459
All right.

35:00.883 --> 35:04.547
Bone ash. Cayenne pepper.
That should do it.

35:04.719 --> 35:07.257
- One second.
- Dean...

35:07.430 --> 35:09.719
Hey, back off, jinx.
Bringing home the bacon.

35:15.104 --> 35:16.183
All right.

35:17.606 --> 35:20.691
Say goodbye, rascally rabbit.

35:23.487 --> 35:26.322
I think you'll find that belongs to me.

35:27.282 --> 35:30.034
Or, you know, whatever.

35:33.246 --> 35:34.823
Put the foot down, honey.

35:35.831 --> 35:37.373
No.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.573
You're not gonna shoot anybody.

35:41.170 --> 35:44.123
See, I happen to be able
to read people.

35:44.297 --> 35:46.456
Okay, you're a thief, fine,
but you're not...

35:49.552 --> 35:52.340
- Son of a...
- Back off, tiger.

35:52.514 --> 35:53.842
Back off.

35:54.015 --> 35:57.099
You make one more move
and I'll pull the trigger.

35:58.311 --> 36:01.477
You've got the luck, Dean.
You I can't hit.

36:01.647 --> 36:03.225
But your brother?

36:03.399 --> 36:04.478
Him I can't miss.

36:07.235 --> 36:08.895
What the hell is wrong with you?

36:09.070 --> 36:11.027
You don't just go around
shooting people.

36:11.197 --> 36:14.067
Relax. It's a shoulder hit.
I can aim.

36:14.992 --> 36:18.444
Besides, who here hasn't shot
a few people?

36:21.290 --> 36:24.125
Put the rabbit's foot
on the ground now.

36:24.293 --> 36:28.337
All right. All right. Just take it easy.

36:33.927 --> 36:35.421
Think fast.

36:38.347 --> 36:40.138
Damn.

36:41.767 --> 36:46.014
Now, what do you say we destroy
that ugly-ass piece of dead thing?

36:50.900 --> 36:52.015
Thanks very much.

36:56.614 --> 37:01.323
I'm out one-and-a-half million and on the
bad side of a powerful, psychotic buyer.

37:01.869 --> 37:04.953
Wow,
I really don't feel bad about that.

37:05.122 --> 37:07.078
- Sam?
- Nope.

37:07.248 --> 37:08.529
Not even a little.

37:08.708 --> 37:10.416
Hmm.

37:12.754 --> 37:16.372
Maybe next time,
I'll hang you out to dry.

37:17.049 --> 37:20.134
Oh, don't go away angry.
Just go away.

37:21.178 --> 37:23.385
Have a nice night, boys.

37:36.067 --> 37:38.604
- You good?
- I'll live.

37:38.777 --> 37:41.399
I guess we're back
to normal now, huh?

37:41.572 --> 37:44.442
No good luck, no bad luck.

37:44.616 --> 37:46.194
Oh.

37:46.785 --> 37:51.696
Forgot, we're up $46,000.
I almost forgot about the...

37:52.207 --> 37:54.246
...scratch tickets.

38:13.810 --> 38:15.683
Son of a bitch!

38:20.024 --> 38:22.349
You were right about everything.

38:22.526 --> 38:25.444
Sam Winchester
is more than a monster.

38:25.613 --> 38:27.688
He's the adversary.

38:27.865 --> 38:29.738
And what was it that convinced you?

38:29.908 --> 38:32.399
God led me to him.

38:32.703 --> 38:34.861
And his will is clear.

38:37.207 --> 38:39.957
Okay.

38:41.001 --> 38:42.412
That's great.

38:42.586 --> 38:44.460
Glad to have you onboard.

38:44.630 --> 38:47.381
But, uh, first things first.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.550
We gotta get me the hell out of here.

38:51.344 --> 38:53.633
Because like I told you before...

38:53.805 --> 38:56.722
...Sam Winchester must die.
