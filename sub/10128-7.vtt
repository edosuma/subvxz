THANK YOU.

00:39.934 --> 00:42.600
UH, EVERYBODY, THAT
MAKES ME THE FIRST LADY.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.400
YOU SEE HOW SECURE I AM
IN MY SEXUALITY?

00:47.100 --> 00:48.667
HEWWO.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.700
YES, I DO.

00:58.700 --> 01:00.734
SO DO I...

01:00.734 --> 01:02.200
TO A POINT.

01:08.467 --> 01:10.900

A PHILOSOPHICAL BELIEF.

01:10.900 --> 01:11.900
WHAT IS IT?

01:11.900 --> 01:13.467

01:13.467 --> 01:15.300
HEY, HE'S A BIG DEAL
WITH THE NEW HAIR.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.600

OF HER OWN ACTIONS

HER OWN DESTINY.

JULIET IS SAYING?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.800

OVER THE THINGS
THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.

HIS NICE SUBURBAN HOME,

01:46.133 --> 01:48.667
AND THEN HE GETS
HIT BY A BUS.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.300
I'LL MISS YOU,
BUDDY.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.000
NO, I DON'T GET
HIT BY A BUS.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
WHY NOT?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
BECAUSE I USE
THE CROSSWALKS,

01:55.000 --> 01:56.367
I MEMORIZE
THE BUS SCHEDULES,

01:56.367 --> 01:57.934
AND IF I GOT
A WIFE LIKE TOPANGA,

01:57.934 --> 02:00.066
I AIN'T LEAVING THE HOUSE!

02:00.066 --> 02:02.934

02:04.667 --> 02:05.734

02:05.734 --> 02:07.934
DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU STAY IN OR GO OUT,

02:07.934 --> 02:10.934
YOUR LIFE IS PREDESTINED,
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

02:10.934 --> 02:12.800
SO YOU MEAN THAT BUS

02:12.800 --> 02:15.400
IS GOING TO DRIVE
RIGHT THROUGH MY HOUSE
TO GET TO ME?

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400

LIKE EQUALS.

THIS GUY'S A FRIEND.

I WANTED TO THANK YOU.

03:06.867 --> 03:08.200
YOU TOOK MY CLASS.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.700
YOU CHALLENGED THINGS.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.700

WHO PARTICIPATES

03:12.700 --> 03:13.900

03:13.900 --> 03:15.567
MAKES CLASS MORE EXCITING.

FROM MY PAPER.

STUART, STUART.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.567
HEY, ROMEO.

09:00.567 --> 09:04.300
CAN I TALK TO YOU
ON THE PATIO
FOR A SECOND?

09:05.600 --> 09:08.800
CORY, YOUR PAPER
WAS PEDESTRIAN.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.734
THIS ISN'T
HIGH SCHOOL ANYMORE.

09:10.734 --> 09:12.000
YOU GOTTA
TAKE CHANCES.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.767
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE PAPER.

09:13.767 --> 09:14.800
YEAH?

09:14.800 --> 09:16.934
YEAH, UH, TOPANGA'S
REAL UNCOMFORTABLE

09:16.934 --> 09:18.500
ABOUT YOUR DORM VISIT.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.000
WHY?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
SHE THOUGHT YOU
WERE HITTING ON HER.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.600
WHAT IF I WAS?

GOSH, I GOTTA GET
SOME BLACK FRIENDS.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.767
SO, TOPANGA, WHAT'S
YOUR MIDDLE NAME?

09:47.767 --> 09:48.934
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY.

09:48.934 --> 09:49.934
WHY NOT?

09:49.934 --> 09:51.200
I HAVE A WEIRD
MIDDLE NAME.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.300
YOUR FIRST NAME'S
TOPANGA.

09:53.300 --> 09:56.000
WHAT COULD YOUR
MIDDLE NAME BE,
SHMUBOOGIE?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.767
CONGRATULATIONS.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.700
YOU JUST GOT YOURSELF
KICKED OUT OF COLLEGE.

10:18.967 --> 10:20.500
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
TO STUART?

10:20.500 --> 10:23.200
SHAWN, I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER HIT
ANYBODY BEFORE.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.367
MOST OF THE TIME

10:24.367 --> 10:25.400
WHEN YOU SPIN
OUT OF CONTROL,
IT'S FUNNY.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.100
BUT THIS TIME,
I THINK YOU
WENT TOO FAR.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.834
YOU COULD GET
IN TROUBLE FOR THIS.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.500
HEY, NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENED,

10:30.500 --> 10:32.000
WE'RE BEHIND YOU.
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.233
THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE
I HIT SOMEBODY,

10:34.233 --> 10:35.400
AND IT'S A TEACHER.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.500
YOU IDIOT!

10:36.500 --> 10:38.467
I THOUGHT YOU HIT
A STUDENT.

10:38.467 --> 10:41.700
WHAT ON EARTH
COULD HAVE POSSESSED YOU
TO DO THIS, CORY?

10:41.700 --> 10:43.300
YOU HIT A TEACHER?

10:43.300 --> 10:45.200
WH-WHAT DID HE SAY?
DID HE THREATEN YOU?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.200
NO.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.367
DID HE HIT<i>YOU?</i>
NO.

10:48.367 --> 10:50.100
WHAT DID HE DO?

10:50.100 --> 10:51.600
HE MADE A MOVE
ON TOPANGA.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
IN THE CLASS?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.400
NO, IN
HER DORM ROOM.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.600
OK, I SAW THE WHOLE THING.
I CAN TESTIFY IN COURT.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.300
THAT TEACHER HIT--I REPEAT--
HIT YOUNG CORY MATTHEWS.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.033
NO, I HIT HIM, ERIC.

11:02.033 --> 11:05.867
I KNOW, I SAW.

11:05.867 --> 11:08.700
LOOK, MOM, DAD, YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY FIFTH SENSE, RIGHT?

11:08.700 --> 11:11.300
YOU'VE TOLD US
ABOUT IT, YES.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.300
I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING,

11:12.300 --> 11:13.400
IT'S WORKING OVERTIME
RIGHT NOW.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.867
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY VEINS.
THIS GUY'S BAD.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.600
YOU CAN'T TALK
TO THAT WOMAN.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.000
SHE'S THE DEAN
OF THE UNIVERSITY,

11:20.000 --> 11:21.300
AND YOU CAN'T
REASON WITH HER.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.567
THIS IS A UNIVERSITY.

11:22.567 --> 11:24.300
THE UNIVERSITY
HAS RULES.

11:24.300 --> 11:27.667
I HAVE RULES,
TOO, MISSY!

11:27.667 --> 11:29.367
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS GUY KNOWS
WHAT HE DID.

11:29.367 --> 11:31.600
AND HE DESERVES
WHAT HE GOT.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.133
THIS IS ALL
GONNA GO AWAY.

11:33.133 --> 11:34.800
THE DEAN HAS
SCHEDULED A HEARING.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.734
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
THAT CORY COULD GET
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.367
COME WITH ME.
COME WITH ME NOW.

11:50.367 --> 11:51.400
DO IT, DO IT.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.200
WHY ARE YOU MY FRIEND?

11:53.200 --> 11:54.767
WHY CAN'T I HAVE
BETTER FRIENDS?

11:54.767 --> 11:56.700

ARE YOU DOING?

11:56.700 --> 11:57.700

11:57.700 --> 11:58.834

YOUNG CORY MATTHEWS.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.500

LISTEN CAREFULLY,

12:01.500 --> 12:03.133
BECAUSE THIS IS
EXTREMELY COMPLICATED.

12:03.133 --> 12:06.200
GO OVER THERE
AND FLAUNT YOURSELF.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.100
I'M NOT GONNA
DO THAT, ERIC.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.100

TEASE HIM.

12:12.133 --> 12:14.000

12:14.000 --> 12:16.300

GO OVER THERE

YOU WILL FLAUNT!

12:25.567 --> 12:26.667
COME HERE,
LISTEN TO ME.

12:26.667 --> 12:29.100
IF THERE WAS
EVER A PROBLEM
IN YOUR FAMILY,

12:29.100 --> 12:30.834
THERE'S NOTHING
I WOULD NOT DO
TO HELP THEM.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.100
I WOULD GO
TO PRISON
FOR YOUR FAMILY.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.467
DO YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE WE LIVE
TOGETHER,

12:34.467 --> 12:37.400
AND I FEEL LIKE I AM
PART OF YOUR FAMILY.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.100

DREAM ABOUT YOU,

12:39.100 --> 12:40.100
AND YOU'RE IN THAT
LITTLE PINK ROBE,

12:40.100 --> 12:41.100

DOING THAT THING--

12:41.100 --> 12:42.934
FINE!

12:42.934 --> 12:44.667
ALL RIGHT, NOW HERE.
PRACTICE ON JACK.

12:44.667 --> 12:45.667

12:45.667 --> 12:47.734

OK.

HOW ARE YOU DOING?

12:52.200 --> 12:54.000
I HEAR YOU'RE
A REALLY GOOD TEACHER.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.233
I'M MORE WOMAN
THAN THAT.

12:57.233 --> 12:59.400

AM I TOO TALL FOR YOU?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.867
IS IT THE FIERY RED HAIR?

13:21.867 --> 13:25.900
IS THE LITTLE BOY AFRAID
OF A COMMITMENT?

13:25.900 --> 13:26.900
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:26.900 --> 13:30.033
I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO REJECT ME.

13:30.033 --> 13:32.300
I'M GONNA REJECT YOU!

13:32.300 --> 13:34.400
YOU WILL NOT HURT ME!

13:37.900 --> 13:39.567
JACK, IF THERE WAS EVER
ANYONE IN YOUR FAMILY--

13:39.567 --> 13:42.367
I'M NOT FLIRTING
WITH A GUY, OK?

13:42.367 --> 13:43.934
I DON'T CARE
IF THEY GIVE YOUR
BROTHER THE CHAIR.

13:47.133 --> 13:49.600
YOU DID CROSS THE LINE.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.133
YOU USED A POSITION
OF POWER UNETHICALLY,

13:52.133 --> 13:54.900
AND CORY PROTECTED ME
THE ONLY WAY HE KNEW HOW.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.567
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO DO THE SAME THING FOR HIM.

13:58.567 --> 14:01.233
YOU LEAVE CORY ALONE.
YOU MAKE THIS GO AWAY,

14:01.233 --> 14:05.367

SEE YOU
AT THE HEARING.

14:24.100 --> 14:27.400

THIS IS NOT A TRIAL,

14:27.400 --> 14:30.500

15:11.467 --> 15:13.667
ALL RIGHT, STUART...

15:13.667 --> 15:15.500
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:15.500 --> 15:16.900
I WAS IN THE STUDENT UNION

15:16.900 --> 15:18.667
WHEN CORY ASKED ME
TO STEP OUTSIDE.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.667
I THOUGHT IT WAS
TO TALK ABOUT
A BAD GRADE I GAVE HIM

15:21.667 --> 15:24.500
ON A PAPER
WHICH I CALLED PEDESTRIAN.

15:24.500 --> 15:30.100
HE THEN ACCUSED ME
OF MAKING A MOVE
ON TOPANGA LAWRENCE...

15:30.100 --> 15:31.767
AND THEN HE HIT ME.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.100
WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN
TOPANGA LAWRENCE'S ROOM?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.600
I WAS GOING OVER
HER PAPER.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.400
IN HER ROOM?
THAT SOUNDS ODD TO ME.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.400
MY STUDENTS AND I
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM

15:41.400 --> 15:44.200

TO CONNECT BETTER
INSIDE THE CLASSROOM.

IT REALLY MATTERS
WHAT I THINK.

YOUR POINT, STUART.

AS A LIVING ROOM...

17:03.300 --> 17:06.734

OR A STUDY.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.233
IT WAS NOT A BEDROOM
WHEN I WAS IN THERE.

17:09.233 --> 17:13.033
STUART, DO YOU BELIEVE
AS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR

17:13.033 --> 17:16.300
THAT IT'S OK TO BE ALONE
IN A DORM ROOM

17:16.300 --> 17:18.500

FEMALE STUDENT?

17:18.500 --> 17:21.867

HER ROOMMATE TO STAY.

AS THE RESPECT HE IS GIVEN,

17:46.900 --> 17:48.367

UNDERMINES ME.

ON TOPANGA.

17:59.133 --> 18:00.400
ON MY FIANCéE.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.800
HE USED HIS POWER
AND AUTHORITY

18:02.800 --> 18:03.967
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF HER,

18:03.967 --> 18:07.100
AND HE TOLD ME
THAT THERE WAS
NOTHING I COULD DO

NEVER GONNA STOP.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.500

18:12.500 --> 18:13.834
I MEAN,
I REALIZE, DEAN,

18:13.834 --> 18:15.567
THIS WASN'T
THE SMARTEST THING
IN THE WORLD TO DO,

18:15.567 --> 18:17.700
BUT IT WAS ALL
I COULD COME UP WITH
AT THE TIME.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.800
STRIKING A MEMBER
OF THIS FACULTY
IS INEXCUSABLE,

18:21.800 --> 18:23.934
NO MATTER WHAT
THE PROVOCATION.

18:23.934 --> 18:25.867
CAN I SAY SOMETHING
REAL QUICK?

18:25.867 --> 18:27.000
YES.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.500
CORY...

18:28.500 --> 18:32.300
IT'S OK WITH ME
THAT YOU HIT HIM.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.133
THANKS, SHAWN.

18:35.233 --> 18:37.100
IT'S OK WITH SHAWN.

18:37.100 --> 18:39.834
WELL, IT'S NOT OK
WITH ME.

18:40.967 --> 18:43.133
ACCORDING TO THE BYLAWS
OF THIS UNIVERSITY,

18:43.133 --> 18:47.100
I AM BOUND TO EXPEL
OR SUSPEND ANY STUDENT

18:47.100 --> 18:50.934
FOR STRIKING AN EDUCATOR
FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER.

18:50.934 --> 18:52.967
DEAN, I BEG YOU
TO RECONSIDER THIS.

18:52.967 --> 18:55.900
GEORGE, SIT DOWN.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.700
YOU CAN'T
PROTECT THEM ANYMORE.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.400
CORY MATTHEWS...

19:01.400 --> 19:05.100
I HEREBY SUSPEND YOU
FROM THIS UNIVERSITY

19:05.100 --> 19:09.100
FOR A PERIOD OF...

19:09.100 --> 19:10.400
ONE DAY.

19:11.467 --> 19:13.367
ONE DAY?

19:14.400 --> 19:15.600
YOU ARE, HOWEVER,

19:15.600 --> 19:19.867
UNDER PROBATION FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THIS TERM,

19:19.867 --> 19:21.500
AND I WILL NOT TAKE KINDLY

19:21.500 --> 19:23.200
TO YOUR SOLVING
ANY MORE PROBLEMS

19:23.200 --> 19:26.100
WITH ANYTHING BUT WORDS.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.367
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT, DEAN.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.367
THANK YOU.

19:29.367 --> 19:31.967
DEAN, HE HIT A TEACHER.

19:31.967 --> 19:36.000
A TEACHER MUST BE
SOMEONE A STUDENT CAN TRUST.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.300
THE SECOND THE TEACHER
USES PRESSURE ON A STUDENT

19:40.300 --> 19:43.400
FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER,
OTHER THAN ACADEMIC,

19:43.400 --> 19:45.133
THAT TRUST IS DESTROYED.

19:45.133 --> 19:46.667
THERE MUST BE SOME SORT
OF MISUNDERSTANDING,

19:46.667 --> 19:47.967
BECAUSE AS A TEACHER, I--

19:47.967 --> 19:49.033
STUART...

19:49.033 --> 19:52.300
<i>THIS </i>IS A TEACHER, STUART.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.200
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU ARE,

19:56.200 --> 20:00.000
BUT YOU CAN BE CERTAIN
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.100
THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.500
EVERYBODY GO HOME.

20:08.934 --> 20:11.233
I AM SO SORRY YOU HAD TO
GO THROUGH ALL THIS.

20:11.233 --> 20:13.133
THANKS FOR STICKING
BY US, GEORGE.

20:13.133 --> 20:14.467
YOU ALL RIGHT, BUDDY?

20:14.467 --> 20:15.467
YEAH.

20:15.467 --> 20:16.867
BYE, BABY.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.600
BYE.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.967
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I COULD'VE
COMPARED HIM TO YOU.

20:21.967 --> 20:23.033
WELL...

20:23.033 --> 20:25.467
I GUESS, UH...
COLLEGE IS
A LOT DIFFERENT

20:25.467 --> 20:26.667
THAN HIGH SCHOOL,
HUH?

20:26.667 --> 20:27.734
I'M AFRAID SO, CORY.

20:27.734 --> 20:31.000
I'M ALSO AFRAID
THAT THE DEAN IS RIGHT.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.934
I'VE TRIED TO PROTECT YOU
FOR TOO LONG

20:33.934 --> 20:36.000
IN THE SHELTERS
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.367
THIS IS A MAJOR UNIVERSITY,

20:38.367 --> 20:39.500
AND THIS IS LIFE,

20:39.500 --> 20:41.667
AND THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

20:41.667 --> 20:45.400
AND YOU'RE NOT
CHILDREN ANYMORE.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.700
HMM...

20:48.700 --> 20:50.033
WE'RE NOT
CHILDREN ANYMORE.

20:50.033 --> 20:51.600
WHEN DID THAT
HAPPEN?

20:51.600 --> 20:55.700
I DON'T KNOW.
TODAY, I THINK.

20:56.834 --> 21:00.734
YOU GUYS WANT TO GET
ICE CREAM OR SOMETHING?

21:00.734 --> 21:01.867
YEAH.

21:01.867 --> 21:03.600
GOOD.
