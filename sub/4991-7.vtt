WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.669
So, I did it.

00:02.669 --> 00:04.271
I finally did it.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.973
Congratulations!

00:05.973 --> 00:08.108
You finally came
aboard the manscaping train.

00:08.108 --> 00:10.310
No. What? I bought a bed.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.980
Oh, you can-- you can
stand up when you manscape.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.014
You'll find out.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.984
Brian, I actually bought,
like, a real bed.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.118
Like, I got rid
of the baby bed.

00:18.118 --> 00:20.220
Hey, all right!
I'm proud of you!

00:20.220 --> 00:22.189
Finally stretching out
like a real man.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.290
You go king? Cali king?

00:23.290 --> 00:26.593
No, it's like a-- a daybed,
pull-out bed kind of thing.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.228
But, you know, I had
to fit it in my living room.

00:28.228 --> 00:31.064
So, no baby bed,
but still baby steps.
That's okay.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.699
Hey, I'm wondering
if you can pick it up for me.

00:32.699 --> 00:36.236
Julia's out of town this week
and we've got some new clients

00:36.236 --> 00:37.604
pitching to us
in a couple of days.

00:37.604 --> 00:38.672
Yeah, sure. I can do that.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.007
-I'll even assemble it for you.
<i>-What?</i>

00:46.647 --> 00:48.115
I'm gonna call you back.

01:19.212 --> 01:21.214
(ethereal music playing)

01:23.750 --> 01:25.185
What?

01:31.058 --> 01:32.459
(quietly)
Get out of this line, now.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.661
No way. I've been
in it for 20 minutes.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.463
As long as no one
challenges the plumbing,

01:36.463 --> 01:38.365
I'll be a new woman
in another five.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.200
(whispers)
Just trust me, please?

01:47.040 --> 01:49.409
(bossa nova music playing)

02:02.155 --> 02:05.325
This. Changes. Everything.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.560
(theme music playing)

02:06.560 --> 02:08.362
<i>♪ 'Cause it's all good ♪</i>

02:08.362 --> 02:10.397
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:10.397 --> 02:12.599
<i>♪ Uh-huh, yup,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:12.599 --> 02:15.268
<i>♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:15.268 --> 02:18.505
<i>♪ 'Cause it's all good ♪</i>

02:18.505 --> 02:21.208
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:21.208 --> 02:22.676
<i>♪ Uh-huh, yup,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:27.347 --> 02:29.049
Oh, my God,
this smells amazing.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.251
Like wandering
through an English garden

02:31.251 --> 02:33.253
after a summer rain.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.089
"Threesome Slam."

02:36.089 --> 02:38.225
Yup. This definitely
Julia's bathroom.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.060
Who else knows about this?

02:40.060 --> 02:41.428
No one.

02:41.428 --> 02:42.996
I only told you.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.264
It can be our secret.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.465
Thanks.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.300
I may sound
like I'm exaggerating,

02:47.300 --> 02:49.569
but this really is
the single greatest gift

02:49.569 --> 02:51.505
anyone has ever
given me ever.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.040
Wow, really?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.574
Well, I mean, this is nothing.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.576
Wait till you see what I got
planned for Christmas.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.679
-(chuckles)
-I mean, I have gotten jewelry,

02:58.679 --> 03:01.581
-plane tickets, a car...
-Yeah, I'm just gonna
quit while I'm ahead

03:01.581 --> 03:02.749
with just the one bathroom.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.318
But an empty bladder
and the confidence

03:05.318 --> 03:09.089
to drink a Big Gulp--
that, Kevin, that is a gift.

03:09.089 --> 03:12.125
Well, good. You know, I'm...
I'm happy to have given it.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.627
-Let's enjoy it.
-Oh, my God.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.163
This is warm.
Lean against this
with me right now.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.265
Your butt will
never be the same.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.569
(both moaning)

03:24.104 --> 03:26.239
-More wine?
-No thanks.

03:27.474 --> 03:30.444
Okay, girl, it's almost
2:00 p.m. and that's only
your second glass.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.045
What's wrong?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.714
I don't want to talk about it.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.115
TV:
<i>Bye, everyone!</i>

03:35.115 --> 03:37.084
I'm just really
annoyed at Dev.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.419
He spends so much time
on his stupid doctor stuff

03:39.419 --> 03:41.521
and the rest of his time
on his DJ playlist,

03:41.521 --> 03:43.557
but he doesn't spend
any time on me.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.425
Like, on top of me.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.360
It's classic doctor DJ behavior.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.229
I don't know
how much more I can take.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.431
I know I'm usually
not very vocal about this,

03:51.431 --> 03:52.733
but I have needs.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.067
Girl, I hear you.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.368
You know, I once dated
a shaman who put

03:55.368 --> 03:56.703
his career before me.

03:56.703 --> 03:59.272
He thought it was his mission
to heal the world.

03:59.272 --> 04:01.241
-Ugh. So selfish.
-Yeah.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.676
So, I threatened
to break up with him.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.679
Suddenly, he's all
about me 24/7.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.315
We did so much ayahuasca,
he thought he was a blowfish

04:08.315 --> 04:10.117
and almost drowned
in the bathtub.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.219
(sighs)
It was really spiritual.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.322
So, you think I should
threaten to break up with Dev?

04:15.322 --> 04:16.723
Oh, up to you.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.358
I'm just saying,
you know, men only respond

04:18.358 --> 04:20.327
to one thing--
emotional manipulation.

04:21.628 --> 04:24.030
Pour me some of that
great idea juice, girl.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.732
There's my girl.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.334
Keep goin'.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.402
Both: (giggling)

04:29.402 --> 04:31.304
Both:
Mmm.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.540
(bossa nova music playing)

04:34.708 --> 04:36.009
Whoo!

04:37.310 --> 04:39.012
(giggling)

04:39.012 --> 04:40.413
Both:
Awww.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.449
Both:
(giggling)

04:46.419 --> 04:47.454
(gasps)

04:47.454 --> 04:49.256
-Audrey: (giggles)
-Kevin: Wow.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.297
I'm so happy you're doing
this for Kevin.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.333
God, I'm so sick of hearing
him whine about his bed.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.968
It's just like
when we were kids.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.670
You know, in fifth grade,
he dislocated his pinky

05:03.670 --> 05:06.039
playing catch with my dad--
whined about it for months.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.074
Damn! Your dad must
have an arm on him.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.442
Oh, no.
The ball was on the ground.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.645
Kevin's pinky bent backwards
when he picked it up.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.114
(laughs)
Stop it right now.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.649
That's-- that's the funniest
thing I've ever heard.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.617
Oh, it gets better.
For, like, a year after,

05:17.617 --> 05:19.319
whenever anyone would ask
him to play catch,

05:19.319 --> 05:22.522
he would lie and say
he had a heart murmur
to get out of it.

05:22.522 --> 05:25.225
-Both: (laughing)
-(phone rings)

05:25.225 --> 05:28.395
Well, now look who it is.
Hello?

05:28.395 --> 05:29.429
Brian.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.398
Kevin, is that you?

05:31.398 --> 05:34.100
I can't hear you
over your fake heart murmur.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.202
(laughs)

05:35.202 --> 05:37.404
Did Roxie tell you that?
It's not fake.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.372
It's self-diagnosed, okay?
There's a difference.

05:39.372 --> 05:42.642
Anyway, I just... (laughs)
Something kind of amazing

05:42.642 --> 05:44.044
happened at work
today with Audrey.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.145
Oh, yeah?
You guys kiss?

05:45.145 --> 05:46.279
Nope.

05:46.279 --> 05:50.050
I found a hidden bathroom.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.251
Where you guys kissed?

05:51.251 --> 05:53.253
No. I just told
Audrey about it

05:53.253 --> 05:55.522
and now the two
of us know about it.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.290
It's actually kind of romantic.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.159
(classical music playing)

05:59.159 --> 06:00.727
(birds chirping)

06:00.727 --> 06:02.562
(giggles)

06:04.431 --> 06:06.132
Ah.

06:06.132 --> 06:08.568
We really bonded over it.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.337
It's like we have a thing now.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.706
-(door slams)
-Hey, what are you doing?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.574
-(hardware clattering)
-Hey, what are you doing?

06:14.574 --> 06:16.042
Stop! That's not right!

06:16.042 --> 06:18.044
My life is over!

06:19.512 --> 06:22.282
-Kev, I gotta go.
-What happened?

06:22.282 --> 06:23.984
-Girl...
-Roxie: What happened?

06:23.984 --> 06:26.052
I told Dev I want
to break up with him

06:26.052 --> 06:27.587
and he agreed with me!

06:27.587 --> 06:29.389
So, now we're broken up.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.091
Got any other
great mind games

06:31.091 --> 06:33.460
for a doctor who takes
everything at face value?

06:33.460 --> 06:35.228
Ugh! I can't believe this.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.496
That's never happened before.

06:36.496 --> 06:39.332
God, it's like he's
rational or something.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.468
I know! I hate him.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.371
This can't be happening.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.506
We've been together
for over two whole weeks.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.607
I can't start over now!

06:47.607 --> 06:49.709
Aww, my poor Patti Cakes.

06:49.709 --> 06:53.546
-That was Devy's
sexy-time name for me.
-Aww. Come here.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.081
(sobbing)

06:56.416 --> 06:58.551
No, don't go.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.986
I need you.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.288
Get comfortable, girl.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.622
I do sad hard.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.324
What about long?

07:04.324 --> 07:06.426
Do you do sad... long?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.594
That's cool.

07:07.594 --> 07:11.031
I'll... I guess I'll go buy
the little felt circle things

07:11.031 --> 07:12.565
that go underneath
the feet.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.301
-(sobbing)
-Aww, poor girl.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.440
(door closes)

07:22.409 --> 07:24.244
(classical music playing)

07:24.244 --> 07:26.413
(birds squawking)

07:31.484 --> 07:33.186
(laughing obnoxiously)

07:34.487 --> 07:38.391
This. Changes. Everything.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.392
(zipping)

07:46.533 --> 07:48.101
Bad news.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.503
Ricky knows about our bathroom.

07:50.503 --> 07:51.671
This sucks.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.140
-Kevin?
-I don't know how he found out.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.576
Unless he already knew?
But we were so careful--

07:56.576 --> 07:58.445
Kevin, I told Ricky.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.114
What? Why?

08:01.114 --> 08:02.582
I'm so sorry.
I had no choice.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.217
Audrey:
<i>Earlier this morning,</i>

08:04.217 --> 08:06.486
<i>I snuck into Julia's bathroom</i>
<i>to restock the soaps</i>

08:06.486 --> 08:08.621
<i>and I made sure</i>
<i>no one saw me.</i>

08:08.621 --> 08:10.223
<i>Or so I thought...</i>

08:12.559 --> 08:14.661
-What were you doing in there?
-I was just check--

08:14.661 --> 08:16.296
Did Julia ask you
to go in there?

08:16.296 --> 08:18.498
-No. I was just--
-What are you hiding?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.433
Nothing. I swear.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.968
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.503
Oh, I think you know.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.105
I think you know
lots of things...

08:25.105 --> 08:26.673
and I'm not leaving...

08:26.673 --> 08:29.309
until you tell me
all the fun little things

08:29.309 --> 08:31.144
that I think you know.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.579
(squeaking)

08:32.579 --> 08:35.081
I had to tell him.
He gets crazy when
he's out of the loop.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.449
You know how
he lost it on Simon

08:36.449 --> 08:38.752
when he found out he got rid
of our Saturday mail pick-up.

08:40.487 --> 08:44.324
This can't sit
in the outbox until Monday.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.726
How am I supposed to get
<i>Grown Ups 2</i>

08:46.726 --> 08:49.029
if I can't return <i>Grown Ups 1?</i>

08:49.029 --> 08:51.031
I don't know.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.565
I think you know.

08:52.565 --> 08:55.368
I think you know
lots of things...

08:55.368 --> 08:57.604
Well, if Ricky knows,
it's only a matter of time

08:57.604 --> 08:59.372
before everyone else
does, too.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.408
He said he wanted
to start interviewing

09:01.408 --> 09:03.209
bathroom attendants, so...

09:03.209 --> 09:05.512
yeah, it's safe to say
he's going wide with it.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.713
(sighs)

09:06.713 --> 09:08.314
I'm so sorry, Kevin.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.616
I know it's a huge bummer.

09:09.616 --> 09:12.018
No, it's okay.
You couldn't help it.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.520
I'm sure
everything will be fine.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.588
Bathroom passes start at $10!

09:15.588 --> 09:18.258
Fast pass works out
to just $.46 an evacuation!

09:18.258 --> 09:20.593
Well, it's official...

09:20.593 --> 09:22.595
I'm gonna die alone
on my baby bed.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.631
I'm sorry, Kev.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.699
I... I tried to finish
the sofa, you know?

09:26.699 --> 09:29.702
But Patti made it
into some sort of... cry nest.

09:29.702 --> 09:32.972
No more sharing
inside jokes with Audrey,

09:32.972 --> 09:36.076
no more sneaking around,
no more special connection.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.446
Dude, is-- is this...
still about the bathroom?

09:41.381 --> 09:43.316
Okay. Um...

09:43.316 --> 09:45.585
I don't mean to judge...
but that's some crazy-ass stuff

09:45.585 --> 09:47.153
you're talking about
right there, Kev.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.656
Brian, the...

09:49.656 --> 09:52.092
The secret bathroom just
gave us something to share.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.693
It was an opportunity
to-- to connect,

09:53.693 --> 09:55.528
and the more opportunities
you have to connect,

09:55.528 --> 09:56.663
the stronger the connection.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.434
Oh, okay.
I'm with you now.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.671
Nope. I lost it.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.606
Um, I'm back to thinking
you're a freak now

10:06.606 --> 10:09.375
because it's dirty, man,
and not in a good way.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.978
Think big picture, okay?
It's not about the bathroom.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.680
Just trust me, okay?

10:13.680 --> 10:16.382
We-- we had some good
momentum and now it's gone.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.551
Okay. So, if it's not
about the bathroom,

10:18.551 --> 10:20.653
then go find your momentum
somewhere else,

10:20.653 --> 10:22.555
somewhere cleaner
without drippity drops

10:22.555 --> 10:24.390
on the floor and where
people don't courtesy flush.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.327
Do you know what?
You're right.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.329
-Psh.
-I don't need a bathroom.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.397
I don't need any room.
We work together.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.600
There will be
plenty of opportunities
to connect with Audrey.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.503
See, now that's--
that's the Kevin I know.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.338
Never giving up hope,

10:38.338 --> 10:39.973
never showing
signs of progress.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.374
Whoo-whoop!

10:41.374 --> 10:43.710
Eight... nine...

10:43.710 --> 10:45.445
56... 57...

10:45.445 --> 10:46.479
We have a problem.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.647
-We do?
-Yeah.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.182
You know how Patti
hasn't left our living room

10:49.182 --> 10:50.750
-since she broke up with Dev?
-Yeah.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.086
She rigged her cry nest
with a hot plate
and mini fridge.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.721
Well, I couldn't stand
to see my best friend hurt

10:54.721 --> 10:57.557
like that, so I paid
Dev a little visit.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.392
And good luck
finding another girl

10:59.392 --> 11:00.527
as awesome as Patti!

11:00.527 --> 11:02.195
She can talk her way
into first class,

11:02.195 --> 11:04.030
she can curse
in six different languages,

11:04.030 --> 11:05.498
and she can spot
a fake handbag,

11:05.498 --> 11:08.067
body part, or personality
from a mile away!

11:08.067 --> 11:09.569
Whoa!

11:09.569 --> 11:11.104
What the hell are you doing?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.973
Exploring all my options
with the fairer sex.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.476
(gasps)
You're gross!

11:16.476 --> 11:19.412
You're not gonna mention
this to Patti, are you?

11:19.412 --> 11:20.613
Oh, no.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.550
Someone needs to teach
that pervy DJ doctor a lesson.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.752
Yes. I knew
you'd agree with me.

11:25.752 --> 11:27.353
-You're so awesome.
-Well...

11:27.353 --> 11:28.621
-Thanks for kicking his ass.
-Huh?

11:28.621 --> 11:31.191
-Call me when it's done!
-No, no, I wasn't talking ab...

11:31.191 --> 11:32.358
Damn!

11:35.628 --> 11:38.998
Hey, so did you hear they--
they want us to partner up

11:38.998 --> 11:40.500
for the--
for the meeting tomorrow?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.468
-Yeah, I heard that.
-Cool.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.270
So, are you
and me doin' our thing?

11:44.270 --> 11:46.673
Oh, sorry,
Ricky already asked me, so...

11:46.673 --> 11:49.609
Oh, he did?
Oh. Are you sure?

11:49.609 --> 11:51.211
Because...
you and me make

11:51.211 --> 11:52.445
kind of a good team,
don't you think?

11:54.113 --> 11:56.149
The lady said no.
She's already got a partner.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.317
Now move it along.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.152
This is my desk.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.220
Hm...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.201
I'm here on behalf of Patti.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.403
You crossed the line
hitting on her best friend.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.039
Now, you're a bookworm,
so you might not know better,

12:20.039 --> 12:22.041
but as a DJ,
you most certainly sh--

12:22.041 --> 12:23.576
-Listen, I--
-No, you listen.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.645
Roxie doesn't want
anything to do with you, okay?

12:25.645 --> 12:29.082
She's far too fun,
and special, and... cute.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.417
Wait, didn't you say
you're here on behalf of Patti?

12:31.417 --> 12:32.552
Yeah.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.054
But just then,
you just said

12:35.054 --> 12:36.990
a bunch of nice things
about Roxie.

12:38.658 --> 12:39.659
Did I?

12:39.659 --> 12:41.594
Look, I thought
I'd make Patti jealous

12:41.594 --> 12:43.730
and she'd come back to me
if I hit on your girl.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.331
My girl?

12:45.331 --> 12:47.000
No. Roxie--
Roxie's not my girl.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.469
But you just got all up
in my face about her.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.438
Did I?

12:55.008 --> 12:56.442
So Roxie's not your girl.

12:56.442 --> 13:00.179
Nah, I mean...
We-- we have fun together,

13:00.179 --> 13:02.181
and she's obviously
adorable, and...

13:02.181 --> 13:03.683
we have our love
for-- for Kevin in common,

13:03.683 --> 13:06.386
but I don't have any
special feelings toward her.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.654
TV:
(dramatic music playing)

13:09.422 --> 13:10.490
I can't authorize this.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.492
It's a security breach.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.260
Man...

13:14.260 --> 13:16.162
I really believe
it's a security breach.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.497
I mean, damn,

13:17.497 --> 13:19.132
that girl can act!

13:24.404 --> 13:26.139
Oh, no.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.340
Dev...

13:27.340 --> 13:29.709
you may be awful
at handling the emotions

13:29.709 --> 13:31.311
in your own relationship...

13:31.311 --> 13:32.745
but I think you're right
on the mark with mine.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.113
Then tell her.

13:34.113 --> 13:35.982
Don't make the same
mistake I did with Patti.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.083
I can't.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.584
That would be a breach
in my friendship with Kevin

13:38.584 --> 13:40.620
-and I can't authorize that.
-So now what?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.355
Our ladies go on
living without us

13:42.355 --> 13:46.025
while we just sit here
sipping our lovely time tea?

13:46.025 --> 13:48.328
Hold up, Doc. Look...

13:48.328 --> 13:50.697
just because I can't
act on my feelings,

13:50.697 --> 13:52.632
doesn't mean
you can't act on yours.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.236
I think it's time to put
Patti back in your rotation.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.674
A DJ and doctor reference.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.009
Very cool.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.748
You think I can't spot a fake?

14:08.748 --> 14:10.583
Excuse me, guys. Excuse me.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.218
-Thank you.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.420
Kevin, I'm gonna
have to ask you to go

14:14.420 --> 14:16.022
-to the back of the line.
-Ricky, please.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.223
You wouldn't even
know about this bathroom

14:17.223 --> 14:18.491
-if it wasn't for me.
-Ha!

14:18.491 --> 14:20.159
Don't take credit, son.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.161
Audrey's the one who couldn't
wait to tell me all about it.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.130
Wait, what? No.
She told me that you caught

14:24.130 --> 14:26.165
her in the act
and you interrogated her.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.333
Psh! Hardly.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.404
Hey, I have
something to tell you.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.974
Okay, here's the deal.
Julia has a secret bathroom

14:34.974 --> 14:37.210
in the office,
behind her painting
of her cat Rutgar.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.412
Santa's elf Rutgar?

14:39.412 --> 14:42.081
No. Cinco de Mayo Rutgar.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.249
This is big.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.417
Who's in the loop?

14:44.417 --> 14:45.518
Just me and Kevin.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.488
Oh, that's why you two
have been giggling so much.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.223
Nope. That's over now.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.558
Oh. Bathroom!

14:53.993 --> 14:55.128
I can't believe she told you.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.729
Well, believe it.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.265
If you'd like to purchase
a pass good for whenever
Julia's out of town,

14:59.265 --> 15:01.701
you may do so when you get
to the front of the line.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.369
-But I'm--
-Now, if you'll excuse me.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.972
I have some Super Flush
members to attend to, huh?

15:05.972 --> 15:07.073
Next!

15:13.212 --> 15:15.014
Audrey?

15:16.082 --> 15:18.050
Hey, uh, so...

15:18.050 --> 15:19.252
here's a funny thing.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.154
I just spoke to Ricky,
who told me

15:21.154 --> 15:22.688
that he didn't interrogate
you at all.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.424
You just kind of told
him about the bathroom.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.359
-That's crazy, right?
-It's complicated.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.060
Can we talk about it
after the meeting?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.729
I don't know.
It seems kind of simple to me.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.030
We agreed to keep
something between us

15:31.030 --> 15:32.698
and then you just told.

15:32.698 --> 15:35.034
Okay. Yes, I told Ricky.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.702
It seemed like
the easiest way

15:36.702 --> 15:38.371
for us to stop tip-toeing
around the office

15:38.371 --> 15:41.073
because should
two cubicle-mates really

15:41.073 --> 15:42.742
keep a secret
from the rest of the office?

15:42.742 --> 15:44.110
Cu-- cubicle-mates?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.178
Yeah.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.246
I mean, keeping
the bathroom between us

15:47.246 --> 15:48.714
made us no better than Julia,

15:48.714 --> 15:51.050
and we don't want that, right?

15:51.050 --> 15:52.084
Right. Right.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.153
Yeah, we don't want
to be anything like Julia.

15:54.153 --> 15:55.755
Right. Okay. Let's go.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.194
Inner Demon Energy.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.196
On the go,
at the gym,

16:03.196 --> 16:06.265
wherever you need
that wicked afternoon boost.

16:06.265 --> 16:07.733
Embrace your inner demon.

16:12.305 --> 16:16.742
Okay. First up,
Lingonberry Lucifer.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.447
It's bold, yet refreshing.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.049
Thoughts?

16:23.049 --> 16:25.151
Not sure.
I'm just too busy thinking

16:25.151 --> 16:27.086
about the long bathroom line
I'm gonna have to wait in

16:27.086 --> 16:29.222
after I drink
all of these. Yikes.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.156
Audrey:
Ricky...

16:30.156 --> 16:32.158
what do you think
about the Hibiscus Hellmouth?

16:32.158 --> 16:35.495
It's spicy, yet welcoming.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.996
(gasps)
Like a Latin mother.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.464
Ooh, I like that!

16:38.464 --> 16:41.167
Yeah, the Watermelon Warlock
sure tastes like he can really

16:41.167 --> 16:43.135
-keep a secret.
-Hmm...

16:43.135 --> 16:45.571
It's subtle,
but I taste that too.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.074
Grape Gargoyle tastes
like maturity

16:48.074 --> 16:50.276
without the bitterness
of dwelling on the past.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.184
Did you finish the bed?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.052
I emotional build.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.488
(knocking)

17:05.691 --> 17:07.293
What is he doing here?

17:09.128 --> 17:11.464
Trust me, okay?

17:11.464 --> 17:14.166
Oh, hello.
Sorry, I forgot your name.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.735
I'm doing great.
I've completely moved on.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.537
Coconut water?

17:17.537 --> 17:20.373
Let's give
these two some privacy.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.709
Who finished the sofa bed?

17:23.709 --> 17:26.012
-Roxie: Come on.
-Was it you?

17:27.547 --> 17:30.249
I never wanted
to break up with you.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.285
I never wanted
to break up with you.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.519
I just wanted attention.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.154
I didn't really know
how to get it.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.155
I'm new to relationships.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.324
I never meant to neglect you.

17:38.324 --> 17:42.261
Who knew balancing surgical
and musical responsibilities

17:42.261 --> 17:43.729
would be so time-consuming?

17:43.729 --> 17:45.998
Look, from here on out,

17:45.998 --> 17:48.401
I'll devote more time to you.
I swear it.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.535
Careful.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.270
You've already taken
the Hippocratic oath

17:51.270 --> 17:53.105
and the oath to jam.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.207
I don't know
if you should do a third.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.177
Then how about I do
something else, Patti Cakes?

18:00.646 --> 18:02.481
We're such a healthy couple.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.387
Wait, so the only reason
that Dev hit on me

18:08.387 --> 18:09.655
was to get Patti back?

18:09.655 --> 18:11.123
Mm-hmm.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.159
Oh, that is so romantic.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.560
Thanks for making
sense of this, Brian.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.362
You're a great friend.
Seriously.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.097
The only useful one
Kevin's ever had.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.699
Oh, yeah, no.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.034
That-- that's cool.
I appreciate that

18:22.034 --> 18:24.236
coming from my best friend
Kevin's little sister,

18:24.236 --> 18:26.038
who I do not need to hug.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.042
I'm gonna go check
on those two.

18:30.042 --> 18:33.646
-(bed squeaking)
-Patti: Ooh, my two
turntables found a microphone.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.047
Nope. Mm-mm.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.283
Well, seems like
we're gonna be stuck in here.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.317
Might as well get comfy.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.485
Can you turn around?
I'm gonna change.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.021
Okay.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.055
(humming)

18:46.325 --> 18:47.994
Oh, my God.

18:47.994 --> 18:51.163
This... You dropped something.

18:53.165 --> 18:55.267
Okay, I'm done.
You can turn around.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.602
Nah, that's-- that's cool.

18:56.602 --> 18:58.337
I'm... good.

18:58.337 --> 18:59.639
I'm good.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.645
Excellent presentation.
Really, really good.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.179
Really great.
And great product, too.

19:07.179 --> 19:08.648
You know,
it just clears your head.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.616
-I feel like I can see better.
-(elevator dings)

19:10.616 --> 19:12.351
You wanna get
that mole checked out.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.253
Thanks.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.554
Audrey!

19:15.554 --> 19:18.324
-Kevin.
-Hi.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.726
So I actually wasn't
done talking to you yet.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.995
No, I was not.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.296
(clears throat)

19:24.296 --> 19:25.998
Why did you really tell Ricky?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.233
I told you why.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.968
Can we stop
with the bathroom secret now?

19:28.968 --> 19:31.270
-It-- it's over.
-So you didn't
have fun in there?

19:31.270 --> 19:32.705
-(elevator dings)
-In a bathroom?

19:32.705 --> 19:36.075
Well, fun's a stretch,
but okay...

19:39.211 --> 19:41.213
So, you didn't like
sharing an inside joke

19:41.213 --> 19:42.548
or sneaking around
together bonding--

19:42.548 --> 19:44.183
just the two of us--
You didn't like that?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.651
Kevin, I'm sorry.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.253
But I'm not looking for things
that bring us closer together.

19:47.253 --> 19:48.721
And that's why
you told Ricky.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.323
Yeah. Sharing a secret
with you didn't feel right.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.359
It-- it felt
like I was cheating
on Brock or something.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.261
I-- I don't know why,
but it did.

19:55.261 --> 19:58.698
I know why.
I know exactly why.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.199
Because you like me.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.234
And honestly,
it doesn't even matter

20:02.234 --> 20:04.070
if you admit it,
because you do.

20:04.070 --> 20:07.273
I know that's
how you see things,
but I don't.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.208
We may have bonded
over a bathroom,

20:09.208 --> 20:11.343
-but it was a bathroom.
-Yeah, today it was a bathroom,

20:11.343 --> 20:12.545
tomorrow,
it'll be something else,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.380
and the next day,
it'll be something else

20:14.380 --> 20:16.215
because that's what happens
when you're meant to be

20:16.215 --> 20:18.017
with someone--
you keep having these moments

20:18.017 --> 20:19.585
that bring
you closer together.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.654
And you can try, Audrey,
but you won't be able
to avoid them forever.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.988
Okay, you know what, Kevin?

20:22.988 --> 20:24.490
You don't know
what you're talking about.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.524
-(car honks)
-Audrey!

20:25.524 --> 20:26.559
(yelps)

20:26.559 --> 20:29.161
(both gasping)

20:35.634 --> 20:38.337
Patti:
Kevin! Can't you knock?

20:40.272 --> 20:41.574
My new bed.
