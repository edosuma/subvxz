WEBVTT

01:49.816 --> 01:51.152
Fuck.

01:54.052 --> 01:55.453
Oh, shit.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.391
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Good to meet you, too, sir.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.233
You should get these
people here, immediately.

11:08.141 --> 11:11.910
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Rob, I'm here with
the Thai Ministry of Tourism.

11:11.946 --> 11:13.978
- He would very much
like to speak with you.
- Thank you.

11:15.642 --> 11:19.083
Hello, Rob. I'm calling you
on behalf of Thai government.

11:19.118 --> 11:22.752
This gentlemen here tells me
you're a cave diving expert.

11:22.788 --> 11:24.857
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

11:24.892 --> 11:27.259
<i>I, uh, I actually</i>
<i>just got back from Thailand.</i>

11:27.294 --> 11:28.993
We have a problem.

11:30.763 --> 11:34.399
Some kids have disappeared
in a cave.

11:36.932 --> 11:38.065
Morning, Lieutenant.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.972
- Morning, sir.
- What's the status?

11:40.007 --> 11:42.908
This cable came in from our
embassy in Bangkok this morning.

11:44.511 --> 11:47.680
Okay, warm up 353 SOG at Kadena.

11:47.715 --> 11:50.014
- Pass it on to the major.
- Roger that.

11:51.548 --> 11:53.479
Are we on?

11:53.514 --> 11:56.216
I am live outside
the Tham Luang Nang Non
cave complex

11:56.251 --> 11:58.419
in the northern Thai
province of Chiang Rai.

11:58.455 --> 12:01.427
We've been following the story
of the disappearance June 23rd

12:01.462 --> 12:03.093
of the Wild Boars football team.

12:03.128 --> 12:06.760
There's 12 teenaged boys
and their 24-year-old coach.

12:06.795 --> 12:10.901
All we really know so far
is that late on the afternoon
of June 23rd,

12:10.936 --> 12:12.869
they went up this road
and into this cave,

12:12.904 --> 12:14.533
and that's the last time
they were seen.

12:14.569 --> 12:17.943
Whether they're still alive
is really anyone's guess.

12:17.978 --> 12:20.275
And people here are hoping
and praying for a miracle.

12:20.310 --> 12:23.178
We'll continue to bring you
updates as they occur.

12:23.214 --> 12:26.614
For Khaosod English
this is Todd Ruiz in Chiang Rai.

12:53.807 --> 12:54.947
General.

12:56.846 --> 13:00.117
The general has
asked his team to brief you on
the situation.

13:03.622 --> 13:04.988
This is the first point

13:05.023 --> 13:07.555
where we found all their
bicycles and shoes.

13:07.590 --> 13:08.959
Okay.

13:08.994 --> 13:11.063
And the second point
we found all their bags.

13:11.098 --> 13:13.964
- How far is it
between the two points?
- Four kilometers.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.827
Okay, are now
those completely flooded,

13:15.863 --> 13:18.605
or is there-there any air
in through here?
Where are you with that?

13:18.640 --> 13:22.604
All from here to here
we have to dive.

13:22.639 --> 13:24.937
If we believe
that they're right here,
is there another entrance?

13:24.973 --> 13:28.109
Is there any other way
so that we're not having
to follow this long path?

13:28.144 --> 13:32.177
Cannot. No way.
Only one way we get in.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.283
And how long 'til that floods?

13:36.519 --> 13:39.726
This is where
the Wild Boars team
entered the cave.

13:39.761 --> 13:42.088
And this is where
we believe them to be now.

13:42.123 --> 13:45.023
That's if they are still alive.

13:45.059 --> 13:49.164
Okay, so if they've been in
there for longer than 72 hours
in those conditions,

13:49.199 --> 13:53.268
realistically,
what's their chance of survival?

13:53.304 --> 13:56.109
This whole area behind us
is Nang Non Mountain.

13:56.144 --> 13:59.076
And when it rains heavily,
we get the water
coming out here.

13:59.111 --> 14:00.806
And then it goes out
towards that pond over there.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.981
We're moving water
from 13 ground water-wells
all around here.

14:05.017 --> 14:06.785
But if we
keep getting rain like this,

14:06.820 --> 14:08.647
then I don't know
if we can keep up.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.122
- Good to see you, mate.
- Great to see you.

14:42.157 --> 14:43.321
John.

14:44.390 --> 14:45.552
Rick.

14:47.193 --> 14:49.655
- How was your journey?
- Not too bad.

14:56.497 --> 14:58.672
Listen, when can the guys
get into dive?

14:58.707 --> 15:00.499
Thai Navy SEALs are down there.

15:00.534 --> 15:02.269
And they said the currents
are too strong.

15:02.304 --> 15:03.874
We're going to
have to maybe wait.

15:03.909 --> 15:05.671
Well, let's take a look,
shall we?

15:37.873 --> 15:40.238
Thai authorities have
not allowed us to dive yet.

15:43.879 --> 15:46.618
They have no way of knowing
where the kids are.

16:08.410 --> 16:10.076
Sorry, no have.

16:18.646 --> 16:21.747
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you from?

16:21.782 --> 16:25.020
Mr. Tan Xiaolong is from
Peaceland Foundation, Beijing.

16:25.055 --> 16:26.954
He's a cave diving instructor.

16:30.494 --> 16:32.428
- You're a side-mount
instructor?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:36.630 --> 16:38.099
I need to learn that.
Yeah.

16:38.134 --> 16:39.400
- Mm.
- Yeah.

16:39.435 --> 16:41.068
Come with me,
I'll introduce you to the guys.

16:41.103 --> 16:42.103
Thank you, thank you.

17:06.631 --> 17:07.727
Hello.

18:29.718 --> 18:31.514
- Will I lead?
- Yeah.

18:31.549 --> 18:34.319
- We go left
at the junction, yeah?

18:57.042 --> 18:58.776
Jim, have you seen this?

18:58.812 --> 19:01.607
Hey. Oh. Oh, Jesus.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.448
That's an accident
waiting to happen.

19:03.483 --> 19:06.646
See those lads, they only have
single cylinders on their back.

19:06.681 --> 19:09.418
In cave diving
you usually wear two cylinders.

19:09.454 --> 19:11.649
Those guys are not
geared up for cave diving.

19:11.685 --> 19:13.289
Then why don't you
go to Thailand

19:13.324 --> 19:14.619
and pull those kids
out of the cave?

19:14.655 --> 19:17.824
- Jim'll fix it, eh?

20:39.209 --> 20:42.675
<i>Thai authorities have now</i>
<i>called in cave rescue divers</i>

20:42.710 --> 20:44.447
<i>from the international</i>
<i>community</i>

20:44.483 --> 20:46.715
<i>to help with efforts</i>
<i>to locate the children.</i>

20:46.750 --> 20:49.280
<i>Thai Navy SEALs are leading</i>
<i>the rescue efforts.</i>

20:49.315 --> 20:53.390
<i>But continuing rainfall</i>
<i>and strong currents</i>
<i>inside the cave,</i>

20:53.426 --> 20:55.522
<i>have prevented them</i>
<i>from making any progress</i>

20:55.558 --> 20:57.759
<i>to find</i>
<i>the missing boys so far.</i>

21:38.465 --> 21:40.734
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:40.770 --> 21:43.704
- How was your day today?
- Oh, not too bad.

21:43.739 --> 21:47.939
Um... what would you think
if I go to Thailand?

21:47.974 --> 21:50.578
Why would you go to Thailand?

21:50.613 --> 21:53.384
To go and help
those kids in the cave.

21:53.419 --> 21:55.916
There's so many people
over there already.

22:10.902 --> 22:13.665
These are the best
cave divers in the world.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.172
There's no one else
like them.

22:16.207 --> 22:18.170
No. Sorry, cannot dive.

22:26.513 --> 22:29.417
He doesn't want to take
responsibility for your safety

22:29.452 --> 22:30.519
because of the water levels.

22:30.554 --> 22:32.487
Look, you've got
these guys over here.

22:32.522 --> 22:34.955
You need to let them
do their job.

25:42.449 --> 25:44.951
Okay.
So, you use this one first,

25:44.986 --> 25:48.949
and you alternate
between the two regulators
every ten to 15 minutes.

25:48.985 --> 25:51.618
When you change to this one, um,
click this one.

25:51.653 --> 25:52.818
- Yeah.

25:52.853 --> 25:56.789
- Good.

25:56.824 --> 25:58.864
- Yes.

25:58.900 --> 25:59.932
Nice, good.

30:07.576 --> 30:09.642
<i>Now to Thailand.</i>
<i>Rescuers there are not</i>

30:09.677 --> 30:13.886
<i>giving up hope in their search</i>
<i>for a missing</i>
<i>youth football team.</i>

30:13.921 --> 30:16.150
<i>Authorities there</i>
<i>believe that they are trapped</i>

30:16.185 --> 30:18.487
<i>in the cave system</i>
<i>that you see here.</i>

30:18.523 --> 30:22.059
<i>They're sending in</i>
<i>some of Thailand's best</i>
<i>to try to get them out.</i>

33:28.008 --> 33:30.978
I'm standing in the mouth
of the Tham Luang cave
in Chiang Rai,

33:31.014 --> 33:34.880
where efforts to find the boys
and coach who went missing
inside last Saturday,

33:34.915 --> 33:38.352
have been hindered
by high water levels
and strong currents.

33:38.387 --> 33:40.421
But, today, the British
civilian cave divers

33:40.457 --> 33:43.061
are getting ready to lay lines
much deeper inside

33:43.097 --> 33:45.724
after water levels
fell substantially overnight.

33:45.759 --> 33:48.366
They did this by redirecting
huge amounts of water

33:48.401 --> 33:53.103
away from the cave complex
using special Turbojet
water pumps.

33:53.138 --> 33:55.473
<i>Unfortunately, for the farmers</i>
<i>down the hill,</i>

33:55.509 --> 33:58.940
<i>that means</i>
<i>flooding their fields</i>
<i>and destroying their crops.</i>

36:11.539 --> 36:14.340
How... how many of you?

36:14.375 --> 36:17.144
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?

36:17.179 --> 36:18.247
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:18.282 --> 36:19.846
- Brilliant!
- Yeah, yeah.

36:19.882 --> 36:22.314
<i> Alright,</i>
<i>enormous relief in Thailand</i>

36:22.349 --> 36:24.652
<i>as rescue teams found...</i>

36:24.688 --> 36:26.689
<i> Breaking news,</i>
<i>the miracle rescue.</i>

36:26.724 --> 36:30.155
<i>The ten day ordeal</i>
<i>playing out in front</i>
<i>of the world...</i>

36:32.491 --> 36:37.665
<i>Authorities say they have found</i>
<i>these 12 kids and their coach.</i>

36:37.700 --> 36:40.337
<i>Look at that, alive in a cave</i>

36:40.372 --> 36:42.705
<i>nearly ten days after</i>
<i>the group went missing.</i>

36:47.946 --> 36:49.179
<i> We are coming.</i>

36:49.214 --> 36:52.548
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>Many people are coming.</i>

37:11.437 --> 37:12.799
Now that they're known
to be alive

37:12.834 --> 37:15.504
attention is turning already
to how to get them out.

37:15.540 --> 37:17.874
The authorities have
three options on the table:

37:17.910 --> 37:21.676
Number one:
Drill holes into the mountain,
create an alternate passage...

37:31.787 --> 37:35.454
So the last option...
is to do it the hard way.

37:35.489 --> 37:37.526
That means sending divers in,

37:37.562 --> 37:40.426
to bring them out
through the flooded passages.

37:40.461 --> 37:42.466
The way they went in, basically.

46:44.207 --> 46:49.078
<i>A Thai Navy SEAL diver</i>
<i>has died trying to save 12 boys</i>

46:49.114 --> 46:52.480
<i>and a coach trapped in a cave</i>
<i>system in Thailand.</i>

46:52.515 --> 46:55.651
<i>I wanna show you a map,</i>
<i>a visual of what</i>
<i>we're talking about here</i>

46:55.686 --> 46:59.423
<i>because you get a sense</i>
<i>of exactly what these crews</i>
<i>have been dealing with.</i>

46:59.458 --> 47:02.891
<i>The man fell unconscious during</i>
<i>his dive back out of the cave.</i>

47:02.927 --> 47:05.391
<i>There's more</i>
<i>monsoon rains forecast</i>

47:05.426 --> 47:07.965
<i>which means more flooding</i>
<i>likely from Sunday.</i>

47:08.000 --> 47:10.396
<i>And this is all a reminder</i>
<i>of the huge challenge</i>

47:10.432 --> 47:13.369
<i>involved in trying to</i>
<i>bring these boys to safety.</i>

47:56.578 --> 48:00.284
This is Todd Ruiz,
live from the Tham Luang Cave
rescue site,

48:00.319 --> 48:03.179
where signs are mounting
that something
is either about to happen,

48:03.215 --> 48:04.815
or may have already begun.

48:16.532 --> 48:18.863
We've got 12 kids
and a soccer coach
trapped in that cave

48:18.898 --> 48:22.333
and as you can imagine
emotions are running
at an elevated level.

48:22.368 --> 48:24.805
We are well aware
of the situation.

48:24.841 --> 48:26.404
What do you suggest we do?

48:26.439 --> 48:28.913
Frankly, sir,
we're running out of time.

48:28.948 --> 48:31.048
If we don't act now
and that weather changes,

48:31.083 --> 48:33.985
we may lose hope of even
getting one of them out alive.

48:46.228 --> 48:47.692
Officially, it's said
that the authorities

48:47.727 --> 48:50.831
are still meeting to decide on
which course of action to take.

48:50.867 --> 48:52.100
But just in the past hour,

48:52.136 --> 48:54.700
ambulances have assembled
at the ready here.

48:54.736 --> 48:57.841
And just a few moments ago
the screen,
sort of privacy screen,

48:57.877 --> 49:00.011
went up over the entrance
of the cave.

49:17.959 --> 49:19.497
And what are the odds?

49:19.532 --> 49:21.227
Well, if we move now,

49:21.262 --> 49:24.533
I can see 60,
70 percent success rate.

49:24.568 --> 49:26.070
But, sir...

49:27.068 --> 49:29.202
we may lose three or four.

49:29.238 --> 49:31.471
Not all these boys
might make it home.

49:50.962 --> 49:54.430
Um, I need
the 40 kilo bag, okay?

49:54.465 --> 49:55.693
Okay.

49:56.467 --> 49:57.530
Thanks.

50:32.567 --> 50:34.598
- Here you are.
- Thanks for the lift, mate.

50:34.633 --> 50:37.174
Good luck, buddy,
take it easy over there.

50:46.678 --> 50:48.147
Did you hear about
the soccer team

50:48.182 --> 50:49.951
stuck in a cave in Thailand?

50:49.986 --> 50:51.314
No, did they all die?

50:51.350 --> 50:53.187
No, they found them alive.

50:53.222 --> 50:55.489
It's all over the news,
check it out.

50:56.660 --> 50:57.854
Wow.

51:01.393 --> 51:03.062
- Mr. Warny.
- Yeah.

51:03.098 --> 51:04.098
Would you like to come over?

51:04.133 --> 51:05.868
- Hi, Jim.
- How're you doing?

51:05.904 --> 51:08.167
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

51:08.203 --> 51:10.501
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

51:10.536 --> 51:12.339
- Flight to Bangkok?
- Yep.

51:12.374 --> 51:14.479
- Thank you.
- Can I take a photo with you?

51:14.514 --> 51:15.338
Yeah, no problem.

51:31.323 --> 51:33.026
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi.

51:33.061 --> 51:34.394
My name is Captain Bas.

51:34.429 --> 51:37.065
- Welcome to Chiang Rai
- Nice to meet you.

51:37.101 --> 51:39.703
You are the hope
of Thai people now.

52:03.055 --> 52:04.459
Thanks.

52:06.491 --> 52:08.724
Hi, guys. Long time no see.

52:08.760 --> 52:11.367
- Probably about seven years.
- Yeah.

52:12.298 --> 52:13.231
- Connor.
- John.

52:13.266 --> 52:14.766
- Hey, Jim.
- Harry.

52:16.671 --> 52:19.210
We're heading in now.
You guys can follow in later.

52:19.245 --> 52:21.471
- Okay.
- Mike and Gary
will brief you first.

52:21.506 --> 52:22.880
- Take care.
- See you later.

52:22.915 --> 52:24.908
- Good luck, man.
- Good luck.

52:43.530 --> 52:45.632
Each of the lead divers:

52:45.667 --> 52:50.341
John, Rick, Jason, and Chris
will take one boy each

52:50.376 --> 52:55.408
and lead them from chamber nine
through to chamber three.

52:55.443 --> 52:58.146
The rest of the guys,
including you,

52:58.182 --> 53:00.149
who are to act
as support divers.

53:00.184 --> 53:02.316
You're gonna help them
change tanks,

53:02.351 --> 53:03.547
and importantly,
you're gonna check that

53:03.583 --> 53:05.053
the positive pressure
face masks

53:05.088 --> 53:07.187
are tight against their faces.

53:07.222 --> 53:10.288
As you know, if those masks leak

53:10.323 --> 53:11.824
those boys will drown.

53:11.860 --> 53:14.760
Especially because they'll be
heavily sedated with ketamine.

53:15.527 --> 53:17.565
What do you mean by sedated?

53:18.365 --> 53:20.271
Totally unconscious.

53:22.200 --> 53:23.472
Hmm.

53:24.404 --> 53:25.804
How much of it's underwater?

53:25.839 --> 53:29.344
The flooded passage is
approximately one kilometer long

53:29.380 --> 53:31.748
with the occasional air pocket
along the way.

53:31.783 --> 53:35.316
The Americans will help you
with your tanks through
to chamber three.

53:35.351 --> 53:36.980
And then you're
in the water at three.

53:37.015 --> 53:41.124
And as you can see here:
150, 200, 350 meters diving.

53:41.159 --> 53:43.757
I've got you
here in chamber five.

53:43.792 --> 53:47.264
When the guys come through,
it's a matter of checking tanks.

53:47.300 --> 53:49.793
You'll have tanks
there to replace, if necessary.

53:49.828 --> 53:53.167
As I say,
just keep checking those masks.

53:53.202 --> 53:54.966
- Okay?
- Mm-hm.

53:55.001 --> 53:57.874
Are we sure we're all good with
that sedation business, yeah?

53:57.909 --> 53:59.605
Yeah. We have no choice.

53:59.640 --> 54:02.879
It's either this...
or there's no diving.

54:02.914 --> 54:04.711
It's too risky.
Yeah.

54:04.746 --> 54:08.517
If they panic and put
our divers' lives in danger...

54:08.553 --> 54:10.948
Yes, sir, but the Australian
attaché told me yesterday

54:10.984 --> 54:13.015
that their people had immunity
before the plane landed.

54:13.051 --> 54:15.752
If we get another rain
one of those boys could drown,

54:15.787 --> 54:17.787
or just as bad,
one of them not wake up

54:17.823 --> 54:19.990
from the sedative
once they're extracted.

54:28.234 --> 54:29.637
Very good!

54:41.513 --> 54:43.420
Two UK divers, yeah.

55:21.887 --> 55:24.226
These are gonna be running
back and forth.

55:24.262 --> 55:26.122
We're gonna check those
in a second.

55:28.432 --> 55:32.401
Sir. Sir, the divers
from the UK are here.

55:32.436 --> 55:33.630
Alright, just make sure
that the UK divers

55:33.665 --> 55:35.136
have everything that they need.

55:35.171 --> 55:36.572
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

55:37.671 --> 55:39.540
Jim, you need
a hand with anything?

55:39.575 --> 55:41.912
Uh, no, I should be fine.
Cylinders here.

55:41.947 --> 55:42.839
- Okay.
- Thanks.

55:42.874 --> 55:44.510
- Anything at all, let me know.
- Yeah.

55:53.885 --> 55:55.657
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:00.193 --> 56:01.462
Change?

56:01.497 --> 56:03.834
No, thanks,
I prefer using my own.

56:03.869 --> 56:04.660
It's okay. Thanks.

56:04.696 --> 56:06.668
I'll change the tank now.

56:12.074 --> 56:14.738
You boys pull this off
there's a bottle of Jack Daniels
waiting for you.

56:14.774 --> 56:17.481
No thanks,
I'd rather have Guinness.

57:34.291 --> 57:36.527
Well, I guess we wait here then.

57:42.062 --> 57:44.697
You know, I can't understand
how it got mixed up.

57:44.732 --> 57:46.063
You know,
they sent the wrong ones.

57:46.098 --> 57:48.405
I will talk to my colleagues
at the Swiss embassy.

57:48.441 --> 57:50.734
- Yes, that'd be good.
- Okay, see you later.

57:50.769 --> 57:52.541
Hi, Ben.
We have a problem.

57:52.576 --> 57:54.576
- Yeah, how can I help?
- It's these masks.

57:54.611 --> 57:56.943
We really need the positive
pressure option.

57:56.979 --> 57:59.745
To ensure air is going out
rather than water coming in.

57:59.780 --> 58:03.053
Also, they're too large
for boys' faces.

58:03.088 --> 58:06.386
The lads were saying,
particularly the 11 year-old--
I mean, he's just tiny.

58:06.421 --> 58:09.858
We sourced a couple
of positive pressure masks
from a shop in Cardiff.

58:09.894 --> 58:12.728
But we need to get them
on a Thai Airways flight
this evening.

58:14.760 --> 58:16.292
I think they're coming, Jim.

58:21.469 --> 58:23.134
Oh, yeah, that's Jason.

58:30.314 --> 58:32.946
- Are you good?
- I'm okay.

58:35.053 --> 58:36.620
I'll keep moving.

58:59.511 --> 59:01.478
This is Todd Ruiz
with Khaosod English.

59:01.513 --> 59:03.307
We're very excited
to be able to tell you

59:03.342 --> 59:06.412
that the first two boys
have been rescued
from the cave.

1:01:11.071 --> 1:01:13.271
These are the masks
they need in Thailand.

1:01:13.306 --> 1:01:15.505
- Good afternoon, sir.

1:01:15.541 --> 1:01:18.307
I guess you're here to make sure
they get to the flight on time.

1:01:18.342 --> 1:01:21.718
How fast are you comfortable
driving, sir?

1:02:56.448 --> 1:02:57.977
Chris, Ivan's not gonna make it.

1:02:58.012 --> 1:02:59.746
His sinuses are
really playing up, so,

1:02:59.781 --> 1:03:01.076
can you sort someone else out?

1:03:01.112 --> 1:03:03.084
- Sure, sure.
- Yeah?

1:03:04.455 --> 1:03:05.722
- Chris.
- Jim, uh,

1:03:05.757 --> 1:03:07.419
looks like Ivan
can't dive today. He's ill.

1:03:07.454 --> 1:03:10.258
- Okay.
- We're gonna be
a man short in chamber six.

1:03:10.293 --> 1:03:13.026
- Yeah.
- Can you go with Erik
and Josh can take your place?

1:03:13.061 --> 1:03:15.460
- Yeah, yeah, sure. Why not?
- Cool, cool.

1:03:15.495 --> 1:03:18.295
You shouldn't need
any more air than yesterday
to get to six.

1:03:18.331 --> 1:03:20.432
- Okay.
- Okay, do you
wanna get changed?

1:03:20.467 --> 1:03:23.672
I'll ask Dr. Harris to come
over and show you how to sedate.

1:03:23.708 --> 1:03:25.200
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:03:25.235 --> 1:03:28.705
- Yeah. Okay.
- Cool, thanks.

1:03:28.740 --> 1:03:32.613
We're gonna give the kids
an intermuscular injection
of ketamine.

1:03:32.649 --> 1:03:34.345
Bloody amazing drug, really.

1:03:34.381 --> 1:03:38.050
It's mainly used these days
as a horse tranquilizer.

1:03:38.085 --> 1:03:40.550
So, I've got these kits
ready for you.

1:03:42.956 --> 1:03:45.223
The syringes are pre-loaded.

1:03:45.258 --> 1:03:48.060
So you wanna find a place
on the upper thigh

1:03:48.095 --> 1:03:50.930
between here and here
and inject them.

1:03:50.966 --> 1:03:53.066
- Give them the full dose.
- Hm.

1:03:53.101 --> 1:03:55.672
So, uh, how deep
do we go with the needle?

1:03:55.707 --> 1:03:57.807
- Only about two-thirds. Alight?
- Okay.

1:03:57.843 --> 1:04:00.806
And each dose must be at least
ten minutes apart,

1:04:00.842 --> 1:04:02.275
or you might lose an airway.

1:04:03.313 --> 1:04:04.376
Hm.

1:04:06.144 --> 1:04:07.809
Means they'll stop breathing.

1:04:07.845 --> 1:04:09.348
Okay?

1:04:15.956 --> 1:04:17.619
- Hm, Erik, is it?
- Jim.

1:04:17.655 --> 1:04:19.695
- Hi.
- How you doing mate?
You're with me?

1:04:19.731 --> 1:04:21.962
Yeah, yeah.
Pity about Ivan, eh?

1:04:21.997 --> 1:04:23.567
- Oh, man, yeah.
- He's okay, is he?

1:04:23.602 --> 1:04:25.634
- Yeah, he'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1:04:25.669 --> 1:04:27.370
So, how do you
rope into this?

1:04:27.406 --> 1:04:28.904
Uh, um, well, I know

1:04:28.939 --> 1:04:31.737
the British lads quite...
quite long now.

1:04:31.772 --> 1:04:36.573
But, uh, a few years back,
a buddy of mine passed away
diving and, uh,

1:04:36.608 --> 1:04:39.441
Rick, John and Jason,
they came over for the recovery.

1:04:39.477 --> 1:04:41.446
Aw, shit, dude.
Sorry to hear about that.

1:04:42.554 --> 1:04:44.084
How about yourself?

1:04:44.119 --> 1:04:46.085
Oh, I've been
living here for a year.

1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:48.283
A friend of mine
was up here and...

1:04:48.319 --> 1:04:50.389
said they needed
some hands so...

1:04:50.889 --> 1:04:52.160
here we are.

1:04:53.464 --> 1:04:55.460
Start gearing up?

1:04:55.496 --> 1:04:57.927
- Mitch, how're you doing?
- Pretty good, how are you?

1:04:57.963 --> 1:04:59.132
What's our ETA?

1:04:59.167 --> 1:05:01.436
Uh, the Brits gone in,
you boys are next.

1:05:01.471 --> 1:05:02.698
Nice, mate.

1:05:03.706 --> 1:05:04.942
Let me help you with that.

1:05:06.939 --> 1:05:08.372
You got the drugs?

1:05:08.407 --> 1:05:10.745
Yeah. Yeah, Harry
sorted me out already.

1:05:10.780 --> 1:05:13.478
It's, uh... I have them here.

1:05:15.785 --> 1:05:17.421
Alright, good luck, gentlemen.

1:05:17.456 --> 1:05:18.989
See you in six, yeah?

1:05:57.155 --> 1:05:58.628
You okay, Erik?

1:05:58.664 --> 1:06:00.459
- All good, mate.
- Cool.

1:06:17.147 --> 1:06:19.816
- You good, man?
- Yeah, mate, I'm good.

1:06:19.851 --> 1:06:22.351
- Good. Keep going.
- Yeah.

1:06:32.862 --> 1:06:35.764
Here we are mate.
Chamber six.

1:06:35.799 --> 1:06:37.496
- Yeah.
- Home sweet home.

1:06:42.601 --> 1:06:45.537
So.. how's the cave diving
in Thailand, then?

1:06:45.572 --> 1:06:48.371
Wouldn't know to be fair.
It's actually my first cave.

1:06:48.407 --> 1:06:50.539
No, I just moved here,

1:06:50.575 --> 1:06:52.308
and I think most of them
are actually shut.

1:06:52.343 --> 1:06:54.783
What about before Thailand?

1:06:54.819 --> 1:06:57.019
Uh, lived in Egypt
for six years.

1:06:57.054 --> 1:06:58.415
Had a little tech center there,
it was great.

1:06:58.451 --> 1:07:01.451
- Yeah.
- Cool. No caves there either.

1:07:01.486 --> 1:07:03.954
Nope. Deep walls
and wrecks, my friend.

1:07:06.060 --> 1:07:07.628
Is that a light down there?

1:07:09.193 --> 1:07:11.126
Yeah. Alright.

1:07:11.161 --> 1:07:12.263
Off you go.

1:07:12.298 --> 1:07:14.368
- That's Chris, is it?
- Yeah.

1:07:18.435 --> 1:07:20.671
He's gonna need a new cylinder.

1:08:09.990 --> 1:08:11.154
Alright, we good?

1:08:11.190 --> 1:08:12.794
The seal okay, is it?

1:08:15.598 --> 1:08:16.595
Okay.

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:19.903
Alright, Jim.

1:08:19.938 --> 1:08:21.668
- Ready to follow me out?
- Yeah.

1:08:21.703 --> 1:08:22.700
Okay.

1:08:58.107 --> 1:09:00.777
- It's wearing off.
- Okay.

1:09:00.812 --> 1:09:04.406
Uh, do you want me to do it?

1:09:04.442 --> 1:09:06.048
- Please, Jim.
- Yeah.

1:09:30.235 --> 1:09:31.571
Okay, we're good.

1:09:33.143 --> 1:09:35.543
Okay.
See you on the other side, yeah?

1:09:35.579 --> 1:09:36.807
Yeah.

1:10:18.348 --> 1:10:22.191
<i>We've just heard from a member</i>
<i>of the rescue operation</i>

1:10:22.226 --> 1:10:24.486
<i>who says he's now seen</i>
<i>an eighth boy</i>

1:10:24.521 --> 1:10:26.860
<i>emerge from the cave.</i>

1:10:42.339 --> 1:10:46.315
Okay, so tomorrow we've got
the coach coming out, too.

1:10:46.351 --> 1:10:49.382
So we need an extra diver
to bring the boy out.

1:10:49.417 --> 1:10:51.882
Jim, do you think
you can handle it?

1:10:58.055 --> 1:11:01.095
- <i> Hi, Jim.</i>
- Hey. How are you?

1:11:01.130 --> 1:11:03.765
How are you?
You look tired.

1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:05.093
Yeah, uh...

1:11:05.128 --> 1:11:08.805
They asked me to bring out
one of the boys tomorrow.

1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:10.400
<i>Wow, that's a big thing.</i>

1:11:10.436 --> 1:11:12.936
How do you feel about it?

1:11:14.746 --> 1:11:16.379
I'm terrified.

1:11:18.717 --> 1:11:20.247
You'll be okay.

1:11:20.282 --> 1:11:22.815
Yeah, the diving's easy,
but, um...

1:11:22.851 --> 1:11:26.851
you know, carrying those kids
through the water, it's tough.

1:11:28.124 --> 1:11:29.987
You know what you're doing.

1:11:30.022 --> 1:11:34.056
And, you know, for the last
two days you did a great job.

1:11:34.091 --> 1:11:36.625
<i>- So, you just go</i>
<i>and do the same.</i>
- Yeah.

1:11:36.660 --> 1:11:38.568
<i>And then you come back home.</i>

1:11:38.603 --> 1:11:39.699
Good.

1:11:41.038 --> 1:11:42.598
I better get some sleep, huh?

1:11:42.633 --> 1:11:44.939
Yeah, go and have some rest.

1:11:44.974 --> 1:11:47.341
<i>Yeah. Kisses.</i>

1:11:47.376 --> 1:11:49.942
Love you, too.
Talk to you tomorrow.

1:11:49.978 --> 1:11:51.909
Yeah. Bye.

1:12:55.111 --> 1:12:56.446
How are you doing, Jim?

1:12:56.815 --> 1:12:58.675
Oh, not too bad.

1:12:58.711 --> 1:13:01.517
Didn't sleep
much last night though.

1:13:01.552 --> 1:13:05.753
- Taking number five out.
- Oh, you'll be fine, man.

1:13:05.788 --> 1:13:07.749
Thanks for leaving me alone
in six though, I appreciate it.

1:13:07.784 --> 1:13:09.817
- No worries.

1:13:09.853 --> 1:13:11.819
- Alright, last day.
- Yeah.

1:13:11.855 --> 1:13:13.727
- Let's finish this off.
- Okay.

1:13:21.566 --> 1:13:23.439
- Jim.
- Oh, yeah.

1:13:23.474 --> 1:13:25.240
How's it going?
I've got the gear for the boy.

1:13:25.275 --> 1:13:27.202
- Thanks.
- Special delivery.

1:13:30.682 --> 1:13:31.745
Alright.

1:13:32.783 --> 1:13:34.349
Cheers.

1:13:34.384 --> 1:13:36.486
You know,
you're doing a great job, Jim.

1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:39.419
It's amazing what you guys do.

1:13:39.455 --> 1:13:41.884
It takes balls
to dive in that cave.

1:13:41.919 --> 1:13:45.691
Well, you guys
are the real heroes.

1:13:45.726 --> 1:13:48.459
Jumping out of helicopters.
Dodging bullets.

1:13:48.495 --> 1:13:51.226
Anyway, rather you than me.

1:15:08.241 --> 1:15:09.612
Hello?

1:15:12.017 --> 1:15:13.242
You in there, guys?

1:15:19.121 --> 1:15:20.218
Hey, guys.

1:15:20.254 --> 1:15:21.850
Hi.

1:15:23.259 --> 1:15:24.891
Jim.

1:15:29.528 --> 1:15:30.965
How was the dive?

1:15:31.001 --> 1:15:32.629
Oh, great.

1:15:32.664 --> 1:15:34.703
Visibility was amazing.

1:15:35.669 --> 1:15:38.039
- Mikko?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

1:15:38.074 --> 1:15:38.900
No, thanks.

1:15:38.935 --> 1:15:41.341
- Grab a bit.

1:15:41.377 --> 1:15:43.041
- Cheers.
- Cheers, mate.

1:15:44.915 --> 1:15:46.143
Mm.

1:15:47.085 --> 1:15:48.516
Are they gone long?

1:15:48.551 --> 1:15:50.950
I don't know.
Feels like forever.

1:16:11.737 --> 1:16:13.137
Put him on his side.

1:16:14.209 --> 1:16:15.178
Big one up.

1:16:15.213 --> 1:16:19.214
Jim... go get your gear on.

1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:58.413
Watch out...

1:17:03.422 --> 1:17:04.826
Okay.

1:17:17.471 --> 1:17:19.071
That's okay.

1:17:21.842 --> 1:17:23.713
Is he gonna need more drugs?

1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:26.045
I just gave him a shot.

1:17:26.811 --> 1:17:27.976
Won't need another...

1:17:28.011 --> 1:17:30.984
until we get to chamber five.

1:17:37.656 --> 1:17:39.124
Breathing.

1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:41.896
There you go.

1:17:42.926 --> 1:17:45.229
- Arms.
- Got it.

1:17:54.045 --> 1:17:55.473
Breathing.

1:17:59.681 --> 1:18:02.812
Okay.
You hold him like this.

1:18:02.847 --> 1:18:05.216
Okay.
I'll go now, yeah?

1:18:07.224 --> 1:18:08.518
See you later.

1:19:06.243 --> 1:19:09.010
You need me to come over?

1:19:09.046 --> 1:19:11.117
No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:16.192
Oh, wait a minute,
he's moving.

1:19:16.227 --> 1:19:17.552
Can you come over?

1:19:18.359 --> 1:19:19.521
Shit.

1:19:24.966 --> 1:19:27.496
He's got a hold of my hose,
actually.

1:19:39.578 --> 1:19:40.949
Okay...

1:19:47.856 --> 1:19:49.859
Okay, hold him still there,
yeah.

1:19:58.762 --> 1:20:00.001
Alright.

1:20:06.704 --> 1:20:08.207
Okay.

1:20:16.385 --> 1:20:18.454
Okay. Done.

1:20:18.489 --> 1:20:19.986
Okay. Should be good, yeah?

1:20:20.021 --> 1:20:22.551
- I'll lead the way. Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:20:23.824 --> 1:20:25.488
- Watch out.

1:21:22.914 --> 1:21:24.547
Ah, fuck.

1:21:27.556 --> 1:21:28.925
Oh, Shit.

1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:10.725
Good, good.
You're doing good.

1:22:14.297 --> 1:22:16.467
What the fuck am I doing here?!

1:23:47.225 --> 1:23:48.928
They're coming.

1:23:48.963 --> 1:23:50.825
Alright, gentlemen, fish on!

1:24:09.950 --> 1:24:12.783
One, two, three, lift.

1:24:17.022 --> 1:24:18.622
One, two, three...

1:24:30.804 --> 1:24:34.040
<i>O'Brien, we've got the coach.</i>
<i>He's all good.</i>

1:24:34.076 --> 1:24:36.244
Roger that,
stretcher two en route.

1:24:37.077 --> 1:24:38.807
- Let's roll.
- Come on.

1:24:41.981 --> 1:24:43.177
We got the coach.

1:24:43.213 --> 1:24:44.817
Great job, Jim.

1:24:44.852 --> 1:24:46.518
Hm, really?

1:24:47.623 --> 1:24:49.186
No wonder.

1:24:49.221 --> 1:24:51.457
He looked a bit big for a child.

1:24:52.091 --> 1:24:53.756
He kept waking up, too.

1:25:21.691 --> 1:25:23.720
Okay, stop and down.

1:25:25.190 --> 1:25:27.455
Ready? Two, three... up.

1:25:27.490 --> 1:25:29.396
- Up.

1:25:32.131 --> 1:25:34.830
Watch the head.
And up.

1:25:37.642 --> 1:25:39.208
Good job, thank you.

1:25:41.177 --> 1:25:43.240
Alright, focus, here.
Try to keep his feet up.

1:25:46.215 --> 1:25:48.477
Help him over the rock there.

1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:51.984
Alright, slow and steady guys.

1:25:52.020 --> 1:25:53.684
Keep... keep his feet up.

1:25:55.124 --> 1:25:56.187
- Get him in.

1:25:56.222 --> 1:25:58.290
Slow, slow, slow.

1:25:58.325 --> 1:26:00.790
Alright, keep him level.
Keep him level.

1:26:02.728 --> 1:26:06.763
Down. Okay, Sergeant,
you wanna grab his pulsox there?

1:26:08.269 --> 1:26:10.433
Okay, guys, slow and steady.
Focus.

1:26:10.468 --> 1:26:11.867
- Get him unclipped.

1:26:11.903 --> 1:26:16.641
- All good, 98, 105.
- Okay, check respiration.

1:26:16.676 --> 1:26:20.341
Okay, guys,
we're gonna move him back.
Alright?

1:26:23.586 --> 1:26:24.950
Okay.

1:29:44.014 --> 1:29:46.687
It's a story
of heroism and sacrifice

1:29:46.723 --> 1:29:50.087
that has captivated
the whole world
for over two weeks.

1:29:50.122 --> 1:29:55.228
But tonight, what was
a desperate mission
of last resort is over.

1:29:55.263 --> 1:29:56.965
They said it couldn't be done.

1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:58.597
But against all odds,

1:29:58.633 --> 1:30:02.270
all 13 members of the Wild Boars
Football Team--

1:30:02.306 --> 1:30:04.934
that's the last one--
are out safely.

1:30:04.969 --> 1:30:07.106
And as you can tell
from the people around me,

1:30:07.141 --> 1:30:12.374
everyone is ready
to celebrate a success
of almost mythic proportion.

1:30:40.471 --> 1:30:41.602
Come on, let's go.

1:30:41.638 --> 1:30:43.204
Get him out of here.

1:31:40.101 --> 1:31:41.130
Head back.

1:31:48.972 --> 1:31:50.909
- You're the last one, Tan?
- Yeah.

1:32:16.539 --> 1:32:19.234
You know what, Tan?
You're a hell of a guy.

1:32:21.274 --> 1:32:22.611
After you.

1:32:44.930 --> 1:32:47.201
We couldn't have
saved those kids without you.

1:32:47.236 --> 1:32:48.569
I can't thank you enough.

1:32:48.604 --> 1:32:50.834
Yeah, well, you guys
were amazing, as well.

1:32:50.869 --> 1:32:52.471
We couldn't have done it
without you.

1:32:52.507 --> 1:32:53.773
You're a hero, buddy.
Thank you.

1:32:53.808 --> 1:32:57.844
Sorry, everyone, um,
this is the kids' family.

1:32:58.977 --> 1:33:01.914
They want to say something
with the team.

1:33:03.285 --> 1:33:04.785
They said "thank you".

1:33:10.359 --> 1:33:12.793
You're welcome. Take care.

1:33:19.762 --> 1:33:21.131
Happy to help.

1:35:14.648 --> 1:35:18.352
Did you feel responsibility,
Jim, for human life?

1:35:18.387 --> 1:35:19.721
Oh, huge, yeah, yeah.

1:35:19.757 --> 1:35:21.753
And how did that
play in your mind?

1:35:21.789 --> 1:35:25.127
Um... you...
you get into this zone.

1:35:25.162 --> 1:35:29.323
You try to pack
all the stresses into a corner
and focus on the job.

1:35:29.358 --> 1:35:32.898
And it's complete...
complete concentration.

1:35:32.934 --> 1:35:35.999
I'm humbled by what you did,
if I may say so.

1:35:36.035 --> 1:35:38.972
- And, I-I-- I am.
