00:02.240 --> 00:03.650
Previously on "Zero Hour"...

00:03.719 --> 00:06.100
- I love you.
- See you, honey.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.220
They're breaking in.

00:10.890 --> 00:13.030
We know quite a bit about 
who might have her.

00:13.060 --> 00:14.860
He's the highest-end mercenary 
in the world.

00:14.900 --> 00:17.200
What would a guy like that be doing, 
taking my wife?

00:17.230 --> 00:19.200
Actually, that was gonna 
be my question to you.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.000
Laila must've bought this today.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.670
Guy was looking for something.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.040
A map. This is the arctic circle.

00:25.070 --> 00:26.670
Investigate who made the clock.

00:26.710 --> 00:29.460
Wherever that thing came 
from may lead to my wife.

00:30.180 --> 00:31.540
We found one of your clocks.

00:32.310 --> 00:34.880
The church appointed 12 new apostles.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.550
One clock was made for each apostle.

00:37.590 --> 00:40.120
They were given a secret.

00:40.160 --> 00:44.660
It was something hidden beneath the cathedral.

00:45.860 --> 00:48.130
It was a secret the Nazis 
could never know,

00:48.160 --> 00:51.200
because the Nazis had figured out

00:51.230 --> 00:55.040
a way to render God irrelevant.

00:55.070 --> 00:57.970
You must find these clocks

00:58.010 --> 01:00.510
before the enemy does,

01:00.540 --> 01:03.680
because if those clocks have resurfaced,

01:03.710 --> 01:07.010
then a storm is coming.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074

01:18.830 --> 01:21.560
1 is the number of man.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.230
1 is the number of you,

01:24.270 --> 01:27.370
but sometimes 1 is not 1.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.470
Sometimes 1 is 2.

01:48.430 --> 01:49.860
No! No!

01:54.600 --> 01:56.000
I know you're going in there for something,

01:56.040 --> 01:58.440
but tell me first--

01:58.470 --> 02:00.240
is my wife alive?

03:02.980 --> 03:08.210
So how does it feel
to look upon yourself, Hank?

03:10.990 --> 03:12.930
It's...

03:12.960 --> 03:15.660
like the insides of your head

03:15.700 --> 03:17.130
sort of...

03:17.160 --> 03:19.330
break apart, don't they?

03:22.700 --> 03:24.600
Understand this, when i execute you,

03:24.640 --> 03:27.710
it will be out of mercy.

03:27.740 --> 03:30.860
The only killing that's gonna be done today 
is by my hand,

03:30.860 --> 03:33.080
and it won't be out of mercy.

03:37.180 --> 03:40.510
Do as you will, but if you kill me, 
you kill his wife.

03:40.550 --> 03:41.850
Where she is, is only up here.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.020
Beck.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.380
No! I've waited too long for this.

03:44.420 --> 03:45.680
No. No. Beck. Beck.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.220
- No. 
- We can--we can do this the right way.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.390
- No. 
- We can both win, okay?

03:49.420 --> 03:50.410
You can take him back,

03:50.410 --> 03:52.420
and i can get Laila back. 
Please.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.260
It ends here.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.450
Where is my wife?

04:16.209 --> 04:18.860
I'll take you to her,

04:18.860 --> 04:20.480
provided you keep the shrew 
from killing me.

04:20.899 --> 04:21.959
And what is...

04:22.650 --> 04:24.030
what is--what is that...

04:25.430 --> 04:27.470
Oh, Hank, brother...

04:29.590 --> 04:32.290
You can still stop. 
Don't ask questions.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.790
What do you know?

04:33.820 --> 04:35.040
Let's go about the business

04:35.040 --> 04:37.960
getting back to civilization, 
shall we?

04:37.990 --> 04:40.260
If you're not gonna tell us,

04:40.300 --> 04:41.960
maybe this will.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.340
You came a long way for it.

04:52.410 --> 04:53.590
Why?

04:54.410 --> 04:56.190
Who are you working for, Vincent?

04:56.780 --> 04:57.970
This isn't you.

04:59.780 --> 05:02.380
Is this some kind of map?

05:02.420 --> 05:04.920
Is that what it is?

05:06.500 --> 05:07.780
Talk!

05:08.900 --> 05:11.630
The threat your gun poses is empty.

05:12.140 --> 05:15.460
You know, i can't get killed, 
not till he gets his wife.

05:15.870 --> 05:19.670
Thus, every threat expressed between now

05:20.120 --> 05:22.520
and that moment is patently hollow.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.540
So stop playing.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.160
I'm trying to remember where we met.

05:30.390 --> 05:32.930
Of course. 
I must have done you a serious wrong,

05:32.980 --> 05:35.510
for i haven't seen hate 
in a woman's eyes like that

05:35.830 --> 05:36.780
in a long, long time.

06:34.310 --> 06:37.180
This is Beck Riley 
of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.

06:37.450 --> 06:38.780
We need help. 
This is a Mayday.

06:39.010 --> 06:40.460
I repeat--Mayday.

06:43.780 --> 06:44.930
Okay, let's get out of here.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.890
Okay. Thank you.

07:17.870 --> 07:18.930
Vincent's plane

07:18.930 --> 07:21.400
landed on a small airfield 12 hours ago.

07:21.530 --> 07:22.690
He killed both men on duty,

07:23.040 --> 07:25.040
absconded with a car.
He's gone.

07:25.460 --> 07:29.100
And now i'm officially in a lot of trouble. 
We'll be in touch.

07:29.150 --> 07:30.990
Wait a second. What do you mean, 
we'll be in touch?

07:31.140 --> 07:32.080
Hank, God bless you,

07:32.320 --> 07:34.400
but the bureau does not send 
a welcoming committee

07:34.610 --> 07:35.970
unless there is a crapstorm coming.

07:36.310 --> 07:37.920
But you didn't do anything wrong.

07:37.950 --> 07:39.580
Yeah, i did. 
I listened to you.

07:39.620 --> 07:41.720
I should've killed vincent 
when i had the chance.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.450
I let my heart get in the way 
of my professionalism.

07:43.490 --> 07:45.790
Because we were trying to save my wife.

07:45.820 --> 07:47.150
And what if she's already dead?

07:48.330 --> 07:50.630
Trust me, that's hard for me to say,

07:50.660 --> 07:52.200
but you have to be prepared 
for that prospect.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.530
She is alive.

07:54.170 --> 07:56.370
Just know, i will kill him next time.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.970
Even if we haven't found Laila?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.770
Yes.

08:00.810 --> 08:03.340
Then we have nothing more to say.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.190
How is it i can call the cops, FBI,

08:10.190 --> 08:11.490
even Interpol,

08:11.630 --> 08:13.790
and all i get is 
"Everyone's working on it"?

08:14.190 --> 08:15.490
But nobody's got anything new--

08:15.520 --> 08:16.760
not on Vincent, not on Laila,

08:16.760 --> 08:18.160
not on anything.

08:18.190 --> 08:20.060
Who pays these people?

08:23.330 --> 08:25.480
Thank God.

08:34.669 --> 08:36.909
What happened out there?

08:36.940 --> 08:38.740
It's about a clock, another one.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.049
The guy in Bavaria said

08:41.049 --> 08:42.289
that there was a secret in the clocks,

08:42.370 --> 08:43.450
that there were 12 of 'em,

08:43.690 --> 08:45.350
and they somehow led 
to the end of the world.

08:45.370 --> 08:47.100
Okay. I want you two to listen to me,
okay?

08:47.130 --> 08:49.740
People will believe whatever 
the hell they want to believe.

08:49.770 --> 08:52.370
Let me tell you what i believe right now.

08:52.410 --> 08:55.310
One--my wife is alive.

08:55.340 --> 08:57.780
Two--i solve this,

08:57.780 --> 08:59.910
I find Vincent. I get her back.

08:59.950 --> 09:02.510
The FBI is gonna take her 
as collateral damage

09:02.550 --> 09:04.930
if it means bringing down Vincent.

09:04.930 --> 09:06.230
I can't have that.

09:06.230 --> 09:07.610
Neither can we.

09:08.170 --> 09:10.190
Hey, this office is full of Ninjas.

09:10.310 --> 09:11.870
We're all cracked out on caffeine,

09:12.110 --> 09:13.090
and we're ready to rock.

09:13.380 --> 09:14.750
We got zero love for the FBI

09:14.780 --> 09:16.920
or anybody in a pantsuit for that matter.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.150
All right, you tell us to jump 
and we're skying for you.

09:19.190 --> 09:20.690
Add one more to that.

09:26.260 --> 09:28.090
You look like hell.

09:28.130 --> 09:30.930
Ah, wrong words to lay on a priest.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.010
I mean it all the same.

09:32.390 --> 09:34.330
Hospital wasn't exactly happy...

09:34.570 --> 09:35.840
I checked myself out.

09:36.110 --> 09:37.730
But i figured you needed me

09:37.730 --> 09:38.600
more than i needed them.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.070
You didn't have to do that.

09:40.110 --> 09:44.380
I will say it every day 
until it actually happens--

09:44.410 --> 09:46.810
we're gonna get her back.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.120
I'll be leaving here soon,

09:54.440 --> 09:55.850
which brings me to you.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.480
See, i've got these bottles of lye here.

09:59.050 --> 10:01.300
That bathtub over there.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.730
And this, uh, prepaid 6-month lease on, 
well, this space.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.900
Meaning if i were to drown you.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.650
Say, soak your corpse in lye

10:11.650 --> 10:13.790
until you look like minestrone,

10:14.400 --> 10:16.900
no one would know until Christmas,

10:16.940 --> 10:20.810
and i'd be saved the crucial things 
of disposing your body.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.280
My point, right?

10:22.310 --> 10:26.410
This is... my point.

10:30.550 --> 10:32.320
Tell me something.

10:32.350 --> 10:34.050
Prove something. Show worth.

10:35.660 --> 10:39.190
I--i can't help you.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.380
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.290
I just... want to get back to my husband.

10:46.930 --> 10:48.530
I don't see any worth there.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.170
If i could help you, i would.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.170
Do you think i'm stupid? 
I know that would keep me alive.

10:54.410 --> 10:58.840
But i can't do anything for you.

11:02.650 --> 11:04.010
Too bad.

11:04.820 --> 11:06.570
According to the guy in Bavaria,

11:06.570 --> 11:07.620
1938 rolls around,

11:07.650 --> 11:09.790
the church is terrified of Hitler.

11:09.820 --> 11:11.860
They appoint 12 new apostles

11:11.890 --> 11:15.030
and entrust them with the ultimate secret.

11:15.060 --> 11:17.390
And it's hidden in these clocks.

11:17.390 --> 11:18.740
The ultimate secret.

11:19.290 --> 11:21.370
He acted like it had something to do 
with the end of the world.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.530
He didn't act like it. 
He said it had started.

11:24.090 --> 11:25.750
Because these clocks had surfaced,

11:25.750 --> 11:26.720
it had started.

11:26.830 --> 11:29.940
People always think 
the end of the world is starting.

11:29.970 --> 11:31.840
It's all about interpretation.

11:31.870 --> 11:34.610
Revelation 16 says the first sign comes

11:34.640 --> 11:36.440
when an angel pours out his bowl

11:36.480 --> 11:39.680
and painful sores break out on the people.

11:39.710 --> 11:42.050
You interpret it one way, that's A.I.D.S.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.720
I don't personally, but a lot of people do.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.050
What was the second sign?

11:46.090 --> 11:47.750
Next angel comes,

11:47.790 --> 11:49.790
pours out his bowl in the rivers,

11:49.820 --> 11:51.290
and they became as blood.

11:51.330 --> 11:54.450
God bless scriptures, Mickle.

11:54.710 --> 11:56.250
Let's not fall into interpretation.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.050
What does this clock tell you?

11:58.750 --> 12:00.920
This engraving on the face of the watch--

12:01.620 --> 12:03.330
the symbol of the apostle Thomas--

12:03.780 --> 12:06.050
doubting Thomas, the one that didn't believe

12:06.330 --> 12:07.820
the resurrection of Christ at first.

12:08.650 --> 12:10.150
So if the last clock led to new Bartholomew,

12:10.370 --> 12:11.730
then this clock will lead to a new Thomas.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.500
Which has gotta be where Vincent's heading.

12:13.710 --> 12:16.750
Which means we can catch him 
as long as we can figure out

12:16.960 --> 12:18.900
what the hell this means.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.400
That's interesting.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.840
These gears-- they're soldered.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.110
This clock was never meant to work 
in the first place.

12:55.140 --> 12:58.330
Who makes a clock 
that's not supposed to tell time?

12:58.610 --> 12:59.450
I got a pitch.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.750
When i was a kid, 
i couldn't sleep at night.

13:02.780 --> 13:04.120
I would just stare up at the ceiling,

13:04.150 --> 13:06.290
and all i would see was stars.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.560
You know, the glow-in-the-dark kind

13:07.590 --> 13:08.690
that you buy at the 99-cent store

13:08.720 --> 13:11.360
and you stuck up there yourself?

13:11.390 --> 13:13.060
Stars.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.200
Maybe it's a celestial map.

13:27.910 --> 13:29.910
So if you connect the dots on the watch,

13:29.950 --> 13:31.410
what you get is a constellation.

13:31.450 --> 13:34.850
More specifically, Cepheus.

13:35.260 --> 13:37.540
You can use constellations as reckoning, 
can't you,

13:37.780 --> 13:38.580
to find a location?

13:38.590 --> 13:39.550
The only problem is,

13:39.770 --> 13:41.720
the constellation alone won't do it.

13:42.130 --> 13:44.160
You need a time and the date

13:44.440 --> 13:46.030
to establish a location.

13:46.740 --> 13:50.770
8:15. March 8th, 1938.

13:55.830 --> 13:57.660
"Stargazer Almanac" tells us

13:57.700 --> 13:59.330
the exact place you have to be

13:59.360 --> 14:01.830
to view the constellation on that date.

14:01.870 --> 14:03.670
We get there first,

14:03.700 --> 14:05.640
find Vincent, and then Laila.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.940
I'm guessing you want me to arrange travel.

14:07.970 --> 14:09.810
Chennai, India.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.340
Chennai, India--

14:11.380 --> 14:13.740
Book the next flight there, please.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.300
Seriously, i'm fine. 
I just have to get to the airport.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.590
Hank, stop. Something's off.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.140
You've been acting different 
since you got back from the tundra.

14:40.150 --> 14:42.030
Please just talk to us.

14:45.940 --> 14:47.420
I saw something,

14:48.140 --> 14:50.510
Something i can't explain.

14:52.610 --> 14:55.260
So the guy in the sub-- 
he looked like you?

14:55.390 --> 14:57.430
No, he didn't look like me.

14:57.460 --> 15:01.030
He looked exactly like me.

15:01.070 --> 15:03.300
- That doesn't make any sense. 
- No, it doesn't.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.370
I mean, there has to be 
a rational explanation.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.360
- I just-- 
- What about that journal 

15:06.360 --> 15:07.370
on the sub? You said Beck took it?

15:07.400 --> 15:09.640
- Maybe it'll give us some answers. 
- No. I want no part of the FBI.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.670
Don't you want to know, Hank?

15:11.710 --> 15:13.040
Who he was?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.480
We do.

15:14.510 --> 15:18.650
Honestly, if i focus on that now, 
i will drop the ball,

15:18.680 --> 15:20.720
and that's about getting Laila.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.720
Then send me. I'll get it.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.020
One condition.

15:28.950 --> 15:32.020
You tell them exactly 
nothing about where i'm going.

15:32.060 --> 15:34.490
Inside a doughnut. Got it?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.030
I got it.

15:38.630 --> 15:41.460
I understand, sir. 
It's just, for whatever reason,

15:41.800 --> 15:43.520
Vincent's being a lot more reckless than usual.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.570
He will ping again, and we will get him.

16:09.190 --> 16:10.690
I'm not bothering you, am i?

16:10.730 --> 16:14.260
Just surprised. How'd you find me?

16:14.300 --> 16:16.970
My generation's got skills 
when it comes to the Internet.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.130
I was hoping you could, um, 
help me with something--

16:19.170 --> 16:20.340
A journal.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.810
Thanks.

16:29.610 --> 16:31.310
You paint.

16:31.350 --> 16:33.370
No, my husband did.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.780
I can't bring myself to take 'em down.

16:36.310 --> 16:39.100
I guess if his work is unfinished, 
then he's still here somehow.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.370
Living with ghosts--

16:42.070 --> 16:43.220
better than being alone.

16:44.610 --> 16:47.610
Alone sucks. 
I can tell you that firsthand.

16:47.650 --> 16:49.280
You were an orphan.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.720
You did your homework.

16:50.750 --> 16:54.050
My generation has a few skills, too, 
Ms. Lewis.

16:54.090 --> 16:56.320
Rachel.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.660
Then i don't have to tell you 
that Hank picked me up,

16:58.690 --> 17:01.030
gave me a job, and a place to live.

17:01.060 --> 17:02.760
I guess the point i'm trying to make is

17:02.800 --> 17:05.630
You don't always have to be alone.

17:05.660 --> 17:07.300
I like your ink. What's the language?

17:09.069 --> 17:13.240
Oh, um, Hindi, Thai, Farsi.

17:13.270 --> 17:15.599
Theo and i were idealists,

17:16.109 --> 17:18.260
loading up on languages as fast as we could.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.640
The more we could learn, 
the more people we could connect with.

17:21.109 --> 17:24.030
That is what youth and a degree 
in social work will get you.

17:24.490 --> 17:26.030
Save the world, one village at a time.

17:26.730 --> 17:29.830
How in god's name did you end up 
working for the FBI?

17:32.430 --> 17:34.890
A plane blows up on the other side of the planet,

17:35.140 --> 17:36.450
your husband's on it, and suddenly,

17:36.700 --> 17:37.930
you don't want to save the world anymore.

17:38.180 --> 17:40.160
You just want to put a bullet 
in the bomber's head.

17:42.250 --> 17:43.780
We've done our thing with the journal.

17:43.820 --> 17:45.790
There's nothing in there for us.

17:45.820 --> 17:48.790
You can tell Hank 
it won't help him find Vincent.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.460
Well, i don't think he wants it of that.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.200
He thinks it might help him understand something--

17:56.230 --> 18:00.370
Something he saw up there, in the ice.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.500
Yeah, i saw it, too.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.640
It was him.

18:05.670 --> 18:08.280
I can't explain it, but it was him.

18:11.390 --> 18:14.420
Maybe something in the journal 
will give you answers.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.520
Maybe he had family in the war.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.030
But i need you to do something for me.

18:21.060 --> 18:24.760
I need you to tell me 
how Hank is planning on going after Vincent.

18:27.030 --> 18:29.040
Vincent was gonna kill Hank.

18:29.070 --> 18:31.380
If i'd gotten there a second later, 
he'd have been dead.

18:31.510 --> 18:32.660
He didn't tell you that, did he?

18:33.070 --> 18:35.880
There's only one language 
that Vincent understands.

18:36.980 --> 18:39.650
Hank may be looking after you,

18:39.680 --> 18:42.550
but are you looking after him?

19:00.620 --> 19:03.450
Mickle, i was trying to get into Vincent's 
head on the way over.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.120
The clock points to Chennai, right?

19:06.160 --> 19:08.820
It turns out that Chennai

19:08.860 --> 19:12.330
is the place where Thomas was supposedly martyred.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.460
If i remember, there's a church isn't there?

19:14.500 --> 19:16.130
Built on the site where he was killed.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.430
Uh-huh. Santhome Basilica.

19:18.470 --> 19:20.900
It's the holiest christian site in all of India,

19:20.940 --> 19:24.010
and at this moment, is exactly where i'm headed.

19:26.210 --> 19:28.140
Pestilence is the first sign--

19:28.180 --> 19:29.440
Illness. Sores.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.380
You know there are more diseases now

19:32.420 --> 19:34.480
than at any time in the history of mankind?

19:34.520 --> 19:36.450
What's the second sign?

19:36.490 --> 19:39.920
A angel pours his bowl 
and the rivers turn to blood.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.490
Slightly awesome.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.590
Hey, Girl Scouts.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.760
We got real work to do.

19:46.430 --> 19:48.200
My German's a little rusty here.

19:48.930 --> 19:50.550
Since when do you know German?

19:51.310 --> 19:53.530
Since i met a girl named Olga Neuberger

19:53.760 --> 19:56.050
in my freshman badminton class, 
if you must know.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.180
I figured german would help me 
get into her good graces

20:00.000 --> 20:01.180
and other places.

20:01.380 --> 20:03.410
So then you're saying you're still a virgin.

20:06.150 --> 20:08.600
Let's see. Navigational stuff.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.320
Navigational stuff.

20:10.450 --> 20:12.340
Navigational stuff.

20:13.740 --> 20:14.840
Name.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.770
Said the guy in the sub was a commandant, right?

20:17.770 --> 20:18.810
- Yeah.   - Then we got a name--

20:19.420 --> 20:21.240
Korbin Sturm.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.560
I like that.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.620
I was expecting a Hans or a Heinrich or something,

20:26.630 --> 20:28.910
but Korbin Sturm-- that's just macho.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.720
Hey, look at this. 
Guess which month is missing.

20:36.050 --> 20:37.770
March 1938.

20:37.780 --> 20:39.130
Same date as the watch.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.750
Getting the feeling something happened that month

20:40.750 --> 20:42.840
that people don't want the world to know about.

20:46.670 --> 20:48.400
Father, do you speak English?

20:48.400 --> 20:49.040
Yes.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.340
- Do you have a minute?   
- I do.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.520
I sort of have an emergency.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.150
Have you seen her?

20:54.150 --> 20:56.230
- Not that i know of.   
- Are you sure?

20:56.230 --> 20:57.730
I work here every day.

20:57.730 --> 20:59.590
A fair western woman like that, 
i'd remember.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.310
What about him?

21:03.080 --> 21:04.100
What is it?

21:05.730 --> 21:07.600
This is the man that abducted her?

21:07.650 --> 21:08.810
He's a killer.

21:09.630 --> 21:11.590
He was here, wasn't he?

21:12.430 --> 21:14.650
He was asking strange questions about the slums.

21:15.460 --> 21:17.920
He disappeared in there 
a few minutes ago at most.

21:18.420 --> 21:19.980
I'll call the police for you, sir,

21:19.980 --> 21:22.240
But the police don't go in slums.

21:22.360 --> 21:25.280
The people in there-- 
they'd kill you for a dollar.

21:27.210 --> 21:28.160
Thank you.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.850
I just got off the phone with 
The Nazi War Criminals Library.

21:38.170 --> 21:39.260
There's such a place?

21:39.270 --> 21:42.190
Yep. And they've got information on our man, 
Korbin Sturm.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.960
Okay. Korbin sturm--

21:44.970 --> 21:48.240
married, no children, 
scientist at The University of Bonn.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.250
Scientist?

21:49.260 --> 21:51.470
Yeah. Until he was conscripted 
into the Nazi party

21:51.470 --> 21:54.120
for field research on something called Zero Hour.

21:54.130 --> 21:56.090
There it is again--Zero Hour. 
What was it?

21:56.090 --> 21:58.000
No one knows. It was all redacted.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.900
Supposedly there's more information out there,

21:59.910 --> 22:01.450
but The Nazi War Criminals Library

22:01.450 --> 22:03.720
said it's in the care of a private collector.

22:04.970 --> 22:07.140
Evidently, for a subset of the population,

22:07.140 --> 22:09.690
Nazi memorabilia is quite the ticket.

22:11.250 --> 22:14.150
Well, as soon as i heard "Modern Skeptic,"

22:14.150 --> 22:15.870
I was over the moon.

22:15.870 --> 22:18.230
I'm a closet fan, if i may say.

22:18.230 --> 22:19.020
You are.

22:19.020 --> 22:22.260
Oh, conspiracies, the mysteries of history--

22:22.270 --> 22:24.020
It's--it's right up my alley.

22:24.170 --> 22:27.550
Yeah, well, um, we're glad you're a reader.

22:28.170 --> 22:30.490
So did you find anything 
on the research program

22:30.490 --> 22:32.380
we discussed? 
Zero hour?

22:32.390 --> 22:34.470
I... think so.

22:39.850 --> 22:41.880
Uh, can i offer you anything?

22:41.880 --> 22:43.210
Brazil nuts?

22:43.310 --> 22:45.010
No, thank you.

22:47.970 --> 22:51.020
I just can't force myself 
to digitalize this stuff, you know?

22:51.020 --> 22:53.930
Like you kids say, music is pure on vinyl,

22:53.930 --> 22:56.200
so too an image is more resonant

22:56.200 --> 22:58.630
when seen projected through celluloid.

22:59.730 --> 23:01.540
At least i think. Aha!

23:02.970 --> 23:04.250
Zero Hour.

23:05.230 --> 23:06.840
Like most Nazi expeditions,

23:06.840 --> 23:10.070
the records were destroyed 
before Berlin fell.

23:10.300 --> 23:13.590
What we do know is an expedition 
was sent to India

23:13.940 --> 23:16.240
at the direct orders of Nazi high command.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.410
And of course, conspiracy theorists,

23:18.410 --> 23:20.910
over the years, have had their theories.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.940
Oh, my god.

23:34.990 --> 23:36.610
Arron, are you seeing this?

23:37.270 --> 23:38.610
The conspiracy theorists--

23:38.610 --> 23:41.530
What--what do they think 
the expedition was looking for?

23:41.720 --> 23:43.060
According to them,

23:43.260 --> 23:44.980
the secret of life...

23:46.420 --> 23:47.720
And death.

24:01.210 --> 24:02.980
We don't have much to go on

24:02.990 --> 24:05.680
besides these films and questionable records,

24:05.680 --> 24:07.490
but people swear the expedition

24:07.490 --> 24:10.040
was looking for the supernatural.

24:10.340 --> 24:11.970
Now who--who is this girl?

24:12.040 --> 24:13.730
Sri Trailanga.

24:14.040 --> 24:17.360
Locals said she had the ability 
to talk to the dead.

24:18.020 --> 24:20.730
Of course i couldn't help myself. 
I had to look into her.

24:22.010 --> 24:23.970
There was never any credible proof

24:23.970 --> 24:26.220
that she did have special powers.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.010
What happened to her?

24:28.570 --> 24:31.030
Disappeared from the history books after that.

24:31.420 --> 24:32.720
No one knows.

25:26.050 --> 25:26.990
Okay.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.150
I don't speak--

25:44.350 --> 25:45.920
That language doesn't work for you?

25:46.200 --> 25:47.730
How about this one?

25:54.010 --> 25:57.140
I didn't know that the FBI trained 
their agents in Hindi.

25:57.490 --> 26:00.630
Residual from my Peace Corps days. 
There's some rust on it.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.370
You here to arrest me?

26:02.370 --> 26:03.840
I'm here to make peace.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.190
I know what it's like to lose somebody, Hank. 
I really do.

26:06.190 --> 26:07.510
I have not lost anyone.

26:07.510 --> 26:09.110
I didn't mean it like that. I--

26:09.110 --> 26:11.670
Look, what you told me before?

26:11.680 --> 26:15.620
Okay, old me would say, yes, you're right, 
my wife is dead,

26:15.670 --> 26:19.380
but it is impossible for me to think that way anymore.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.770
I know. The skeptic suddenly believing

26:22.770 --> 26:25.480
in something he can't even prove himself--

26:25.540 --> 26:27.180
That his wife is alive.

26:27.350 --> 26:28.930
It's because we need it, Hank.

26:28.930 --> 26:30.760
We--we need to believe in something.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.430
So now she suddenly understands me?

26:33.480 --> 26:36.990
You are motoring headlong into a war zone, Hank.

26:36.990 --> 26:39.160
Vincent will kill you without blinking an eye.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.010
We have had this conversation before.

26:41.010 --> 26:42.890
I am not gonna let you kill him

26:42.890 --> 26:44.390
without me getting what i want first.

26:44.390 --> 26:46.950
We'll do it the right way. 
I will arrest him,

26:46.950 --> 26:50.180
we will interrogate him, and we will get Laila.

26:51.660 --> 26:54.320
Hank, i came here to help you.

26:56.210 --> 26:57.920
- Rachel?  -  Hank.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.200
I think our stories might have just overlapped.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.440
This girl--

27:01.560 --> 27:03.640
She could be the one Vincent's looking for.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.380
It's just a hunch, Hank, 
but what if she's New Thomas?

27:06.380 --> 27:08.280
Maybe the Apostles weren't all men.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.970
In 1938, Sturm was with her in India.

27:11.310 --> 27:12.620
I mean, she's this holy woman,

27:12.630 --> 27:14.450
and he's completely fascinated with her,

27:14.450 --> 27:16.490
and then she conveniently disappears from history

27:16.490 --> 27:17.790
after he crosses her path?

27:17.790 --> 27:18.790
I mean, isn't that the point?

27:18.790 --> 27:20.250
To keep the existence of these Apostles

27:20.250 --> 27:21.370
hidden from the rest of the world?

27:21.370 --> 27:24.430
I mean, she'd have to be what, 80, 
if she's alive?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.900
With that birthmark underneath her eye.

27:33.010 --> 27:34.350
The scientist--

27:34.690 --> 27:36.350
What's--what's his name again?

27:36.600 --> 27:37.940
Korbin Sturm.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.700
Sturm.

27:39.710 --> 27:41.120
Be safe, okay?

27:41.570 --> 27:42.900
You, too, Hank.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.750
It may not be my place,

27:48.990 --> 27:51.740
but we're talking about Apostles,

27:51.750 --> 27:55.260
and one of them is not only a woman 
but also a Hindu?

27:55.960 --> 27:57.650
It'd break all the rules--

27:58.600 --> 28:01.280
The kind of rules that a lot of people 
don't want to see broken,

28:01.290 --> 28:03.580
to the point that they would kill over it.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.530
So we've got a Nazi scientist

28:16.530 --> 28:18.710
looking into the supernatural in India.

28:19.190 --> 28:21.260
How does he go from that to being dead,

28:21.260 --> 28:24.050
in a submarine, 5.000 miles away from Germany?

28:28.400 --> 28:29.470
Ray?

28:30.560 --> 28:31.470
Yeah?

28:31.670 --> 28:33.790
Ask and you shall receive.

28:46.450 --> 28:48.130
"Fur meine ehefrau."

28:49.100 --> 28:50.240
"For my wife."

28:55.020 --> 28:56.830
- No. - Oh, what?

28:56.830 --> 28:58.710
- I've gotta go.   - No.

29:01.810 --> 29:04.640
- They‘re breaking in. 
- Laila? Laila?

29:05.760 --> 29:07.050
I love you.

29:09.590 --> 29:10.680
I love you.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.430
Those guys who attacked me in the alley--

29:20.750 --> 29:21.860
Why?

29:22.880 --> 29:25.020
There's a lot of desperation in the world, Hank.

29:26.060 --> 29:28.990
They see westerners, understandably, 
as rich people.

29:29.490 --> 29:30.900
So you think it's about money?

29:32.640 --> 29:34.100
But why do i still have this?

29:34.820 --> 29:37.180
I have a different hypothesis for you.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.450
It wasn't because we were carrying money.

29:39.450 --> 29:41.640
It's because we were carrying weapons.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.430
They were protecting someone.

29:44.670 --> 29:45.910
- Here. - Thank you.

29:47.290 --> 29:49.040
You can't possibly know this, Hank.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.610
It's a flier, for sure.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.040
If there's a holy woman hidden in there,

29:53.120 --> 29:55.540
you're sure as hell not gonna shoot your way to her.

29:55.690 --> 29:58.870
"I am writing to you officially as a soldier,

29:58.870 --> 30:00.450
"My dearest wife,

30:00.880 --> 30:04.700
A man of gun and uniform"...

30:06.460 --> 30:07.800
"A bringer of death,

30:09.210 --> 30:13.580
"For that is what the Nazi party has trained me to become.

30:14.640 --> 30:18.340
"But you alone have known the real me all these years--

30:18.770 --> 30:20.280
"A man not of hate,

30:20.280 --> 30:23.440
But one of... faith."

30:38.120 --> 30:40.300
"Dark things are upon us, love,

30:41.230 --> 30:42.810
in so many ways."

30:47.470 --> 30:50.510
"But i have searched for those 
that would stand against it,

30:53.270 --> 30:56.410
And in the least expected places, 
i have found them."

31:21.220 --> 31:22.910
He's saying that we should get lost.

31:22.910 --> 31:24.990
Well, that's the P.G. version anyhow.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.220
It's...it's okay.

32:31.660 --> 32:34.330
They call her Khardi Amma.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.060
"Standing mother."

32:36.330 --> 32:39.200
She made a vow 70 years ago never to sit

32:39.380 --> 32:41.460
out of some sort of defiance.

32:59.500 --> 33:00.750
New Thomas.

33:08.780 --> 33:11.930
"We were neither Christians 
not Hindus in that moment"...

33:15.440 --> 33:18.030
"Only people with a common aim"...

33:22.480 --> 33:24.660
"To keep the species alive."

33:27.420 --> 33:31.210
Have...have you seen either of these people?

33:32.250 --> 33:34.110
Did they come to you?

33:39.490 --> 33:42.370
This man, apparently, is looking for a clock.

33:42.810 --> 33:46.510
If...if you have it, i can...
i can make a deal with him.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.360
She says that she has a clock,

33:56.570 --> 33:59.680
But that she was told that 
if she ever saw your face,

33:59.690 --> 34:02.550
that she was to destroy it.

34:03.430 --> 34:04.920
Who told her that?

34:09.010 --> 34:10.300
You did.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.310
Come on. What else does it say?

34:27.480 --> 34:28.659
It says...

34:30.250 --> 34:33.469
"Nothing in the world matters but love."

34:35.510 --> 34:37.040
"The smallest things"...

34:38.080 --> 34:39.610
"How one cooks"...

34:43.800 --> 34:45.199
"How one sleeps"...

34:49.380 --> 34:51.860
"And you don't realize how beautiful they are"...

34:54.810 --> 34:56.889
"Until you stand to lose them forever."

34:58.720 --> 35:00.760
I love this woman.

35:01.510 --> 35:02.810
You understand?

35:03.350 --> 35:04.980
If you have a secret,

35:04.980 --> 35:07.420
you...you have to help me.

35:10.770 --> 35:14.160
She wants to know how you know that
Laila is here.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.510
I feel it.

35:26.550 --> 35:28.890
She says you came to her 70 years ago,

35:29.210 --> 35:31.180
and said if you returned,

35:32.000 --> 35:35.020
it would prophesy the coming of 
the angel of death.

35:41.970 --> 35:45.270
"We have intruded on God's grounds, my love."

35:45.450 --> 35:48.340
"I have seen unspeakable things."

35:49.110 --> 35:51.420
"What i know now makes me a threat,

35:51.420 --> 35:52.900
"Not only to man,

35:53.440 --> 35:54.470
"But god.

35:55.390 --> 35:59.530
"Because of that, i must leave 
all that is sacred in my life--

36:00.520 --> 36:01.540
You."

36:01.790 --> 36:04.560
I will not leave without her.

36:12.260 --> 36:15.640
"This woman. You've traveled around the world
to find her.

36:15.940 --> 36:18.980
Death stalks you, and yet, still you come."

36:22.160 --> 36:23.540
That's right.

36:29.810 --> 36:30.800
No! No!

36:30.800 --> 36:31.990
No! No! No!

36:35.670 --> 36:37.520
Drop it! Drop it!

36:52.530 --> 36:53.670
The priest.

38:22.790 --> 38:24.000
It's Vincent.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.300
Hank! Cut him off at the street!

38:59.550 --> 39:00.900
"That's why i left--

39:01.500 --> 39:02.830
"to save you,

39:03.540 --> 39:05.930
"to save all of mankind."

39:11.560 --> 39:13.900
"I only wanted to save you,

39:15.800 --> 39:18.840
"But have i killed my own heart 
in the process?"

39:32.360 --> 39:34.100
Laila! Laila!

39:35.100 --> 39:36.480
Laila!

39:38.960 --> 39:40.440
I'll find you!

39:40.950 --> 39:42.310
Laila!

39:48.550 --> 39:51.260
"I chose the world over you, my love.

39:52.580 --> 39:54.610
"But if i had to do it again,

39:56.750 --> 39:59.470
I'd choose you over the world."

40:11.840 --> 40:13.490
She said she was wrong,

40:14.300 --> 40:16.770
that the angel of death tonight wasn't you,

40:17.720 --> 40:20.120
but that the darkness of the coming apocalypse

40:20.130 --> 40:21.450
is now upon us.

40:21.660 --> 40:22.660
What?

40:28.330 --> 40:30.790
She says, you alone hold the key.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.430
She says, if you continue on your quest,

40:44.850 --> 40:46.860
it'll bring about the end of the world.

40:49.650 --> 40:51.120
Tell her if i stop,

40:53.040 --> 40:55.320
I'll...i'll lose my wife, and i can't do that.

41:13.310 --> 41:14.910
What does she mean by that, Hank?

41:15.580 --> 41:16.660
I don't know.

41:17.830 --> 41:19.980
Why would she say the end of the world is coming?

41:31.080 --> 41:34.220
The angel pours his bowl into the rivers,

41:35.140 --> 41:37.640
and they become as blood.

41:47.470 --> 41:49.330
Maybe the signs are here,

41:49.950 --> 41:51.890
and we just haven't seen them.
