00:13.960 --> 00:16.920
Jim, I'll need
eight battery-operated candles.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.160
They're in my desk drawer.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.120
- Will you just answer a simple question?
- If I hear one, of course.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.200
- Uh, this way, please, Jim.
- What is happening?

00:28.200 --> 00:29.800
Why is everything so weird?

00:29.800 --> 00:32.440
This all started last week
when the power went out, didn't it?

00:32.440 --> 00:34.000
Three questions, none of them simple.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.120
But to answer
your last one, no.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.440
This all started a very long time ago.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.560
But... also, yes.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.200
So, why were we all dancing?

00:44.400 --> 00:46.680
I thought it might make you realize
that Maggie loved you,

00:47.520 --> 00:49.040
and then you'd fall in love with her.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.680
It all looks so simple in Jane Austen.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.560
Jane Austen?

00:53.560 --> 00:57.160
Oh, yes, the brains behind
the 1810 Clerkenwell diamond robbery.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.080
You're going to let us in,
whether you like it or not.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
Not.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.520
You are not welcome here.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.920
<i>Heaven. Doors opening.</i>

01:14.920 --> 01:18.160
- Right. Where do you keep your records?
- Records?

01:19.120 --> 01:21.000
You're a scrivener, 37th class.
Records, where?

01:21.720 --> 01:23.560
- My office, but--
- Lead on.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.960
But... No, I can't!

01:25.960 --> 01:28.040
You're a demon! I can't just--

01:28.040 --> 01:30.360
Do you know how much trouble
I'll get into for this?

01:30.360 --> 01:31.720
It's fine.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.080
You're forgetting about the bees.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.560
- Bees?
- Angels are like bees.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.160
Fiercely protective of their hive
if you're trying to get inside.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.360
Once you're in... well, I mean...

01:41.600 --> 01:45.360
is it even faintly possible that
an unauthorized demon might be just

01:45.360 --> 01:48.160
wandering around in Heaven unescorted?

01:49.320 --> 01:50.480
Mm, bees.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.200
But you don't look like a bee.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.360
You look like a murder hornet

01:55.360 --> 01:56.960
or a snake or a--

01:57.680 --> 01:59.200
Bees. Right.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.400
Your office. I'll follow you.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.120
Go, go. Hide.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.880
You lot are ridiculous.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.600
We are the legions of the damned.
We are invincible.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.760
You might be invincible, but you're still
stuck out there, and we're in here.

02:25.760 --> 02:26.960
You don't frighten me.

02:33.760 --> 02:37.520
I had brothers.
You don't scare me by making faces.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.280
- Just leave 'em alone, Maggie.
- No.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.440
I'm not scared of them.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.560
I've spent my life being scared of things.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.520
And I'm done with being scared.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.040
Please, Maggie.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.840
Yes, please, Maggie.

02:49.840 --> 02:55.040
Please don't embarrass yourself in front
of the woman you pathetically love.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.440
She's not embarrassing herself.
She's... braver than anyone I know.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.240
Two cowards.

03:01.240 --> 03:05.160
You posture bravely because
you are in there and we are out here.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.640
Leave us alone. Leave this shop alone.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.480
Leave Mr. Fell alone.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.520
You are nothing, Maggie.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.320
Look at you. You run a shop nobody visits,

03:16.320 --> 03:19.000
unable to pay the rent. Dull.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.480
You're unloved and unlovable.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.240
You're a nobody,

03:24.240 --> 03:27.800
and you'll live,
and then you'll die, a nobody.

03:32.840 --> 03:36.200
My God, you lot are pathetic.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.440
You wanna come in here
and say that to my face?

03:44.640 --> 03:46.000
Come on, quickly. Go!

03:58.480 --> 03:59.560
Maggie,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.280
what just happened?

04:01.280 --> 04:03.920
I... I think I might have just told them
they could come in.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.000
Get back... Get back here now,
fast, please.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.080
It's for your own good.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.520
I am perfectly prepared
to take defensive action,

04:13.520 --> 04:14.960
should it become necessary.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.680
Stay back.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Hello?

04:22.920 --> 04:24.600
Is there anybody there?

04:30.560 --> 04:31.600
I have to tell you,

04:32.480 --> 04:34.480
you can all leave now,

04:35.440 --> 04:37.040
and nobody will be hurt.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.520
You'll be hurt.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.440
- Mm, nice office.
- It's a bit lonely.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.280
That was why I was so pleased when
they said I finally had a job on Earth.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.280
Don't you ever see anyone here?

06:45.280 --> 06:48.760
Well, every few hundred years
someone comes and asks me for something.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.680
- You're not really under arrest, are you?
- Not really, no.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.240
I'm helping you, aren't I?

06:56.880 --> 06:57.880
Yeah.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.720
- I'm going to get into so much trouble.
- You think so?

07:03.960 --> 07:07.480
Well then, let's make it worthwhile.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.720
What have you got on Gabriel?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.800
It's all confidential.
I can't show it to you.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.080
I mean, I couldn't open it if I wanted to.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.680
I don't have clearance.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.200
You'd have to be a throne
or a dominion, or above.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.680
- How did you do that?
- I haven't always been a demon,

07:41.680 --> 07:43.440
and they never change their passwords.

07:52.160 --> 07:55.240
Go on, you idiots. Get them!

08:12.760 --> 08:15.080
They aren't gonna
keep walking into the circle forever.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.760
Even demons aren't that stupid.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.000
So, what's your plan?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.360
Well, that was it.
I didn't have another bit.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.720
Uh... this way, quickly.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.880
Why do they keep blowing up?

08:30.880 --> 08:33.800
Well, it's all a bit complicated.
The circle, it's a gateway,

08:33.920 --> 08:36.120
but if you step into it
and you aren't prepared,

08:36.120 --> 08:38.440
it can discorporate you completely.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.480
Does what you say make sense in your head?

08:42.120 --> 08:44.120
Stop where you are!

08:45.000 --> 08:46.200
And so...

08:48.080 --> 08:49.080
it ends.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.160
Everything ends.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.760
Time and the world

08:54.360 --> 08:55.480
is over,

08:55.480 --> 08:57.720
and we begin eternity...

08:59.120 --> 09:00.880
forever and ever.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.160
Amen.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.760
- Amen.
- Amen.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Nah.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.880
Nah?

09:11.760 --> 09:12.760
Yep.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.640
Nah.

09:15.400 --> 09:19.040
Nah to the final victory
of Heaven on Earth?

09:19.040 --> 09:21.120
Sorry, just not seeing it this time.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.240
Pass.

09:23.240 --> 09:27.640
And may I ask
why you're not seeing it?

09:28.480 --> 09:29.480
Surely.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.320
- Why?
- I told you you could ask.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.120
However, I am the only
first-order archangel in the room,

09:36.120 --> 09:38.200
or, you know, the universe,

09:39.120 --> 09:40.880
so I'm not gonna answer so much.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.600
But you feel free to knock yourself out
with all the asking.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.000
Anyway, Armageddon the sequel,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.520
that's a nah.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.040
What's next on the agenda?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.520
- The cleaning roster.
- Okay!

09:54.720 --> 09:55.720
What have you got?

09:56.240 --> 09:58.600
I think we've struck gold.

09:58.600 --> 09:59.640
Push!

10:12.760 --> 10:15.040
- It's working!
- Well, yeah!

10:22.960 --> 10:24.880
There's even more
fire extinguishers up here.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.040
Why all the fire extinguishers?

10:30.040 --> 10:33.080
Uh, well, there was
a fire here once, you see.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.880
And, um... well, books can go up like...

10:37.760 --> 10:40.240
- Well, anyway...
- Brilliant

10:40.240 --> 10:41.760
Got any of that spray foam?

10:43.320 --> 10:48.200
So, Gabriel refused point blank
to entertain another Armageddon?

10:48.200 --> 10:49.840
Doesn't sound like him at all.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.880
Any idea why not?

10:52.520 --> 10:54.880
Not yet. They had a sort of trial.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.040
It was a real trial.
It didn't take long, though.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.800
Hello, Crowley.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.240
I didn't expect to ever see you again.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.280
Do we know each other?

11:04.280 --> 11:05.800
When you were an angel.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.960
We worked together
on the Horsehead Nebula.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.120
I meet a lot of people.

11:12.160 --> 11:16.640
Muriel, you're the last person I'd expect
to see collaborating with the enemy.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.760
- Oh.
- Um...

11:18.360 --> 11:21.320
I suppose, from some points of view,
this could look bad,

11:21.320 --> 11:23.600
- but I did arrest him.
- No, you didn't.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.040
Well, don't let me interrupt you. Go on.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.280
Show him the trial.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.080
Shax, I charge you to leave this place,

11:33.080 --> 11:35.440
with all your people,

11:35.440 --> 11:38.360
and to jolly well hurry up about it,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.920
or I'm going to have to take

11:41.920 --> 11:43.320
severe measures.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.280
Aziraphale, what are you?

11:47.280 --> 11:50.880
Crowley's emotional support angel?

11:50.880 --> 11:54.600
The softest touch.
The one who went native.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.520
Do you need more
big human meals, Aziraphale?

11:59.120 --> 12:01.640
Shall we send up the sushi?

12:01.640 --> 12:04.920
Give us Gabriel.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.880
Give him to us now.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.200
- Sometimes people call me Gabriel.
- Shh.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.320
And tell that moron

12:11.320 --> 12:14.120
to stop interrupting.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.040
Jim, go... go to your room.
You'll be safer there.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.120
Okay. Good night.
Does anybody want any hot chocolate?

12:19.120 --> 12:21.240
- No.
- Go.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.520
Gabriel, Supreme Archangel,

12:49.520 --> 12:52.800
you have refused to exercise
your celestial authority

12:52.800 --> 12:56.680
and you are henceforth
removed from office.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.200
I see. You're casting me down to Hell.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.200
Well, I accept my fate.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.440
Sometimes an angel just has to say,

13:04.440 --> 13:06.720
"Guys, enough."

13:06.720 --> 13:09.120
- Even though--
- No speeches, Gabriel.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.440
You are not going to Hell.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.680
For one prince of Heaven
to be cast into the outer darkness

13:15.680 --> 13:17.240
makes a good story.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.920
For it to happen twice,

13:18.920 --> 13:23.600
makes it look like there is
some kind of institutional problem.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.800
Which there isn't.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.440
Which, needless to say, there isn't.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.160
You will, I am sure
you'll be glad to learn,

13:30.160 --> 13:32.040
remain an angel.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.040
Although, as a kindness,

13:34.040 --> 13:38.080
your memory of your time as Gabriel
will be erased.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.880
You will be demoted

13:40.480 --> 13:43.200
to junior recording angel,

13:43.960 --> 13:45.760
38th class.

13:45.760 --> 13:49.240
Oh, that's pretty good,
actually. I'm 37th class.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.360
I didn't know that there was one down.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.120
I see. Well, all good things.

13:54.120 --> 13:57.240
Uh, just one thing.
These clothes are tailored.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.600
Can I keep wearing them?

13:58.600 --> 14:02.000
Appropriate raiment
will be provided for you, Gabriel.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.840
- These clothes?
- Are not appropriate.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.000
Got it. Well, I'll just need to take off
my clothes and clean out my desk, then.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.360
- You have a desk?
- Yes, I do.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.640
I'll just need a...

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I'll be right back.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.320
- Can we throw books at them?
- I'd rather you didn't.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.120
Obviously no fiction, but encyclopedias?

14:32.120 --> 14:35.000
- It's all online these days anyway.
- Oh, if you must.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.320
Ah!

14:41.040 --> 14:42.160
Ah!

15:00.480 --> 15:01.880
What? What's he...

15:11.560 --> 15:13.080
<i>Doors opening.</i>

15:15.720 --> 15:18.200
- He dropped it!
- <i>Doors closing.</i>

15:18.800 --> 15:19.840
<i>Going down.</i>

15:27.480 --> 15:28.560
What's keeping him?

15:28.560 --> 15:31.160
I believe he's taking off his clothes
and cleaning out his desk.

15:31.160 --> 15:34.600
Uriel, he doesn't have a desk.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.920
I don't trust him.
Can we begin the memory wipe now?

15:37.920 --> 15:39.160
What, without him here?

15:41.680 --> 15:43.800
- Good idea.
- Right.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.520
I can't... I can't
find his memory anywhere.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.640
In fact, I can't find him in the building.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.120
He's left Heaven.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.400
- Should I sound an alert?
- Oh, don't be so wet.

15:58.120 --> 16:02.080
No, you're all just
going to have to find him. That's all.

16:02.960 --> 16:07.320
Stop lollygagging, you cowards.
Get back up those stairs.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.960
Fire extinguishers have all been emptied,
and we're out of encyclopedias.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.600
We can't... We can't stop them.

16:13.520 --> 16:14.520
What do we do?

16:16.080 --> 16:17.960
Desperate measures must be taken.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.920
I haven't done this since the Great War.

16:34.240 --> 16:38.160
It's something we're only
meant to do when we're actually

16:38.720 --> 16:41.760
on a wartime... footing.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.400
What did you just do?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.200
I think...

17:30.440 --> 17:32.560
I may have just started a war.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.280
What just happened?

17:36.280 --> 17:38.560
I think your friend
just declared war on Hell.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.320
This could get very messy.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.480
Ugh, right, come on!
Let's get back there.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.760
You too.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.000
Funny old world, isn't it?

18:03.440 --> 18:04.440
Hello?

18:05.080 --> 18:06.080
Anybody here?

18:07.240 --> 18:08.240
You came back.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.480
What did you do to them all?

18:13.480 --> 18:15.080
I did the thing with the halo.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.080
- You what?
- I did the thing with the halo.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.000
You... [chuckles] You blew up your halo?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.800
Ooh, Hell won't like that.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.680
We are at war! Finally!

18:39.680 --> 18:41.680
Nobody's at war.

18:41.680 --> 18:45.920
You idiots sent an idiot to lead
a gang of idiots to attack a bookshop.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.400
Those idiots there want
their archangel back so they can fire him.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.080
Nice job, Shax.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.400
Beautifully done.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.320
Remind me to put in for your commendation.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.760
- Sarcasm, yes?
- Yep.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.400
I'm afraid so.

19:14.320 --> 19:18.320
- If it is to be war--
- No, no, no, no, no war.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.640
Aziraphale, let's sort this out.
Where's the cardboard box?

19:21.480 --> 19:24.080
- What box?
- The one Gabriel arrived with.

19:25.320 --> 19:27.560
Gabriel? He's here?

19:27.680 --> 19:32.200
- Sometimes people call me Gabriel.
- Yeah, we did a thing... hiding miracle.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.080
Apparently, if we do a miracle together,
it all works a bit too well.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.560
- Careful. Could be a trap.
- It's a cardboard box.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.800
It's not going to bite you.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.680
Oh, there we go. I thought
that's what you were doing.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.800
- What was I doing?
- You were writing a message.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.240
<i>Oh, probably to yourself,
on the bottom of the box.</i>

19:58.240 --> 20:00.720
"I am in the fly."

20:00.720 --> 20:02.080
What fly?

20:03.520 --> 20:04.720
Lord Beelzebub,

20:05.400 --> 20:06.720
I believe flies are your department.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.520
Mm.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.880
There's only one fly here,
and it's familiar.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.640
Come here. Come on.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.400
Good boy.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.440
No wonder
nobody could find you.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.480
This is where you were
keeping all your memories.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.240
All your... you.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.800
Look at you.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.400
You're perfect.

20:40.880 --> 20:41.880
Here.

20:42.920 --> 20:43.920
Take it.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.800
Gently.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.200
Now...

20:54.080 --> 20:55.080
open it.

21:10.080 --> 21:15.000
How I am supposed to get
ten million angels to stand down

21:15.000 --> 21:17.200
from their war footing is...

21:17.760 --> 21:18.960
It doesn't bear thinking about.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.720
You should try to get ten million demons

21:20.720 --> 21:23.200
to put down their weapons
and go back to work.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.520
Well, at least we know whose fault it is!

21:35.000 --> 21:37.440
You can't sit there,
I'm waiting for someone.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.080
- You're waiting for me.
- I don't think so.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.320
New face.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.560
I had the old one for 6,000 years.
I just thought it was time for a change.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.920
- I don't know who you are.
- Come on, it's me.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.320
Beelzebub. Lord of the Flies.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.680
Watch.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.920
- There you go.
- Why did you wanna meet me here?

22:00.920 --> 22:02.680
Well, if we're gonna have
background talks,

22:02.680 --> 22:05.000
they can't be in either
of our home territories.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.200
And what do we need to discuss?

22:08.640 --> 22:09.960
Arma-bloody-geddon.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.720
That was a complete
and utter pain in the ass.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.920
- I know, but we are ready for round two.
- As are we.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.600
Utterly ready. Armageddon, here we come.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.960
Arma-bloody-geddon. Arma-bloody-geddon.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.480
Ah.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.440
- Well, you lost.
- So did you.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.240
- No, we didn't.
- Well, you didn't win.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.960
Tell me about it.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.080
Everyone in Heaven is all like,
"Well, you're the commander-in-chief,

22:32.080 --> 22:34.240
can't you just make the war
happen anyway?" Like, I make the rules.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.240
That's exactly what my lot said.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.320
Well,

22:38.320 --> 22:40.600
it's good to know there's someone
who understands. Thank you.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.560
It's a pity we'll never speak again.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.360
I have a proposal to make.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.960
Instead of Armageddon, what about...

23:00.960 --> 23:02.040
no Armageddon?

23:04.600 --> 23:06.040
An interesting proposal.

23:07.800 --> 23:08.920
No Armageddon.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.920
They won't like that, though.

23:11.920 --> 23:15.120
Most of my demons live for Armageddon,
if you can call that living.

23:15.120 --> 23:18.040
Well, my angels too.
But you can't always get what you...

23:19.240 --> 23:20.240
live for.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.600
Advantages to no Armageddon?

23:22.600 --> 23:26.920
We keep the status quo,
static and, um, quo-ey.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.240
- No one can ever know, of course.
- Of course.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.840
A deal?

23:36.160 --> 23:37.200
Mm.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.280
I like this song.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.000
Song?

23:47.640 --> 23:49.560
- The music that's playing now.
- What music?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.080
The noise.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.640
That's music?

23:54.080 --> 23:55.080
I like it.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.960
Contains information in a tuneful way.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.120
Every day something is getting closer.

24:05.480 --> 24:08.400
Then, um... Then I also like it.

24:08.400 --> 24:12.800
<i>♪ Love like yours
Will surely come my way ♪</i>

24:12.800 --> 24:15.160
<i>♪ A-hey, a-hey, hey ♪</i>

24:15.160 --> 24:20.480
<i>♪ Love like yours
Will surely come my way ♪</i>

24:24.280 --> 24:25.320
So...

24:26.160 --> 24:27.480
agreement concluded.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.200
No need to ever meet again, is there?

24:33.920 --> 24:35.240
None whatsoever.

24:45.760 --> 24:46.960
Let there be light.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.160
I think the sculptor
really caught something.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.080
The shape of the head.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.120
Beautiful. Really moving.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.680
It's a very good likeness.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.360
Sometimes I come here
for hours and just...

25:01.440 --> 25:02.440
look at it.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.800
Right. Shall we go to the pub?

25:15.800 --> 25:20.080
Two goblets of your intoxicating liquor,
please. And, uh...

25:20.080 --> 25:21.920
- Packet of crisps.
- Very good, sir.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.320
Which liquor would that be?

25:24.960 --> 25:28.600
Whichever one it is you humans
usually orally consume.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.760
Two pints of regular, then.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.360
What's that?

25:39.040 --> 25:41.080
A classic 1960s jukebox.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.760
You don't see many of them these days.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.080
You just put your money in
and tell it what you want to hear.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.160
Oh...

25:48.880 --> 25:49.920
You people.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.760
Amazing.

25:56.560 --> 25:57.560
Ha!

25:59.360 --> 26:01.720
<i>♪ Everyday it's a-gettin' closer ♪</i>

26:01.720 --> 26:05.240
<i>♪ Goin' faster than a roller coaster ♪</i>

26:05.240 --> 26:09.600
<i>♪ Love like yours
will surely come my way... ♪</i>

26:10.280 --> 26:11.520
Here you go.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.240
- You don't actually have to consume.
- Oh.

26:17.240 --> 26:20.560
- And the...
- Oh, packet of crisps? Good.

26:20.560 --> 26:24.480
<i>♪ ...yours will surely come my way ♪</i>

26:25.480 --> 26:27.160
Is that... Did you...

26:28.120 --> 26:29.960
- A small miracle.
- Oh.

26:29.960 --> 26:33.200
That song will always be there
on that jukebox,

26:33.200 --> 26:35.600
- to comfort the afflicted.
- Mmm.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.840
I should give you something.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.880
Here. It's for you.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.080
You never know when you'll need it.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.320
It's a container, so...

26:52.320 --> 26:55.760
it's bigger on the inside.
You can put things in it.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.600
Bye-bye.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.520
I don't actually know what to say.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.520
Why not?

27:19.200 --> 27:21.360
No one's ever given me anything before.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.320
<i>♪ ...seems a little longer ♪</i>

27:26.320 --> 27:28.800
<i>♪ Every way, love's a little... ♪</i>

27:44.560 --> 27:45.600
Aziraphale.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.520
Michael, Uriel.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.360
- Don't tell me.
- I won't.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.160
- It's Saraqael!
- Saraqael!

27:59.160 --> 28:01.320
Yes, I knew that. Of course it is

28:03.520 --> 28:04.960
Oh, eesh.

28:05.840 --> 28:06.840
You guys.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.760
You.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.560
Thank you.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.280
Silly, silly angel.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.360
Why?

28:20.200 --> 28:22.760
I was coming to you, but...

28:23.840 --> 28:25.040
I...

28:26.120 --> 28:27.440
forgot.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.320
Well, I think Aziraphale probably
took much better care of you

28:32.320 --> 28:33.720
than I could've done.

28:33.720 --> 28:34.840
Beelzebub!

28:35.600 --> 28:37.360
You traitor!

28:37.360 --> 28:39.160
Collaborating with Heaven?

28:39.640 --> 28:41.440
I didn't collaborate with Heaven

28:41.440 --> 28:44.600
any more than
Gabriel collaborated with Hell.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.960
I just found something that
mattered more to me than choosing sides.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.160
That's really sweet.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.520
- Enough to make you believe in true love.
- Mortals?

29:02.280 --> 29:05.040
What are mortals doing here?
Someone turn them into pillars of salt.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.720
- Saraqael.
- I'm on it.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.120
That... That won't be necessary.
I'll see to this.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.960
Maggie, Nina, you come with me.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.720
You got this?

29:13.720 --> 29:16.040
Oh, um, absolutely, yes.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.520
Just don't, uh,
tell anybody about any of this.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.640
Not that anyone would
ever believe a word of it.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.560
Oh, God, I should've been open
half an hour ago.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.560
How can you think about that
after all this?

29:29.560 --> 29:31.800
People need coffee, I sell coffee,
it's my coffee shop.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.000
- I should be open by now.
- Right, nice knowing you both.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.080
Let's say goodbye forever

29:35.080 --> 29:36.880
and pretend none of this
ever happened, yeah?

29:38.760 --> 29:41.680
Oh. Some of us
have been working all night, you know.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.640
Where did you come from?

29:53.600 --> 29:54.640
I don't remember.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.560
Good call.
Never tell them how it's done,

29:57.560 --> 30:00.320
unless they pay you for it first.
Here, pick a card.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.240
I'm going to my shop,
to sleep behind the counter.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.000
Unless you'd like some help?

30:11.320 --> 30:13.440
Could you nip down the mini mart
and pick me up some cream,

30:13.440 --> 30:15.360
oat milk, soy milk, and almond milk?

30:15.360 --> 30:16.800
Mm. I'm on it.

30:22.640 --> 30:23.840
I can't hear you.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.920
Can we have-- Please, can we have a...

30:33.680 --> 30:35.480
I've had quite enough of this.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.760
You will speak one at a time.

30:42.320 --> 30:46.080
I demand that you handover
both Gabriel and Beelzebub

30:46.080 --> 30:49.440
as gifts for Satan, our master.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.120
He won't want them.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.440
Maybe as hors d'oeuvres.

30:53.440 --> 30:56.000
And I demand you hand them over to us,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.960
to face celestial punishment.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.120
Obviously we would be
reserving the option

31:00.120 --> 31:02.280
to send them both to Hell
as our punishment.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.280
But we'd be the ones doing it.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.040
Why don't we ask them

31:06.760 --> 31:08.040
where they'd like to go?

31:08.040 --> 31:09.600
Oh, this is ridiculous.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.480
No, there are precedents.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.280
Hell doing Heaven's punishing for you.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.040
Job, that was one.
Lovely man, never met him.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.120
Um, Gabriel,

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Beelzebub,

31:20.440 --> 31:21.480
what do you want?

31:23.720 --> 31:25.600
I would like...

31:26.960 --> 31:28.000
better clothes,

31:29.120 --> 31:31.320
and I would like to be with Beelzebub.

31:31.320 --> 31:34.200
Wherever Beelzebub is...
is my Heaven.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.320
Mm-hmm.

31:35.320 --> 31:38.320
And where you are,
my sweet, is forever my Hell.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.920
You know, Alpha Centauri's nice.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.160
Always wanted to go there.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.640
Couple of decent planets.
No nightlife to speak of.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.000
If you leave,

31:47.000 --> 31:48.480
you can never come back.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.400
- That would be the point.
- If you flee,

31:51.400 --> 31:52.800
traitor,

31:52.800 --> 31:56.360
Hell will send all its legions
to hunt you down.

31:56.360 --> 32:00.840
You know as well as I do
how badly understaffed Hell is right now.

32:00.840 --> 32:03.200
Anyway, with me not there, Shax,

32:03.840 --> 32:05.800
you could be the next Grand Duke of Hell.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.600
Grand Duke of Hell.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.880
Angels and Demons, they can't just--

32:11.880 --> 32:16.000
<i>♪ Everyday, it's a-getting closer ♪</i>

32:16.000 --> 32:20.560
<i>♪ Going faster than a rollercoaster ♪</i>

32:20.560 --> 32:22.880
<i>♪ Love like yours will ♪</i>

32:22.880 --> 32:25.760
<i>♪ Surely come my way ♪</i>

32:25.760 --> 32:28.680
<i>♪ A-hey, a-hey-hey ♪</i>

32:29.560 --> 32:32.440
Ah, if you're going back to Hell,
can I get my flat back?

32:32.440 --> 32:34.800
- Who the hell cares?
- I care!

32:34.800 --> 32:36.520
I'm bored of living in my car.

32:36.520 --> 32:39.240
And I don't think
my car's much of a fan of it either.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.160
I believe the Dark Council

32:41.160 --> 32:44.720
will have something to say
about all this nonsense.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.960
Well, I'm sure they'll be thrilled
that the mighty Shax

32:47.960 --> 32:51.000
has uncovered a traitor in our midst.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.840
Let's find out, shall we?

33:07.320 --> 33:09.840
Order accurately and fast.
I haven't slept in 30 hours

33:09.840 --> 33:12.160
and I will not hesitate to mock you
if I don't like your order.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.800
Yes, I quite understand.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.080
I'd like a...

33:16.680 --> 33:19.400
large oat milk latte

33:19.400 --> 33:22.680
with a dash of almond syrup, please.

33:23.680 --> 33:24.680
Coming up.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.760
Do people ever ask for death?

33:27.760 --> 33:28.920
What?

33:29.440 --> 33:33.640
Well, the name of your establishment,
"Give Me Coffee or Give Me Death."

33:33.640 --> 33:35.760
I assume they always ask for coffee.

33:36.440 --> 33:37.920
They don't ever ask for death, no.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.880
No, I don't suppose they do.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.480
So predictable.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.960
I am authorized to remove
the name of anyone

33:45.960 --> 33:48.400
who helped Gabriel from the Book of Life.

33:48.400 --> 33:51.360
You will never have existed, Aziraphale.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.840
In the absence of Gabriel,

33:53.840 --> 33:56.320
- I am the Supreme Archangel.
- Duty officer.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.080
- And I--
- Excuse me, I'm sorry,

33:58.080 --> 34:00.160
I must interrupt you there.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.880
Um...

34:01.880 --> 34:04.520
Oh, and I've brought over a coffee.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.960
I don't believe I asked
for any interruptions.

34:06.960 --> 34:10.560
I couldn't help it.
You're talking utter balderdash.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.160
I mean, complete piffle!

34:12.960 --> 34:15.800
You don't have the authority
to do anything like that.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.840
Um, and who are you?

34:18.600 --> 34:20.160
For Heaven's sake.

34:20.840 --> 34:24.080
And I mean that most literally.
You don't know me?

34:24.920 --> 34:28.640
Well, uh, what about you, Demon?
Do you know me?

34:28.760 --> 34:31.280
- Get him out of here!
- Really?

34:31.280 --> 34:32.760
Oh, I know you.

34:32.760 --> 34:36.160
Last time I saw you,
you were a big, floating giant head, man.

34:36.960 --> 34:37.960
Oh!

34:38.840 --> 34:39.880
The Metatron.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.120
Correct!

34:41.120 --> 34:43.600
This calls much less attention, though.

34:44.320 --> 34:48.040
Right, you, you, you, back to Heaven,
spit, spot, not another word.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.920
Ah-ah-ah! Not you.

34:51.640 --> 34:55.160
Um... Your... Your Reverence, your...

34:55.920 --> 34:58.080
- You Grace, your...
- Oh, come on, spit it out.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.040
Have we done anything wrong?

35:01.840 --> 35:04.880
Well, that remains
to be seen, does it not?

35:06.280 --> 35:08.480
Well, go on, off you go, the lot of you!

35:08.480 --> 35:11.440
Except the dim one.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.440
I may need you.

35:18.680 --> 35:19.680
Right.

35:20.760 --> 35:23.680
It's just you and me, Aziraphale, eh?

35:24.640 --> 35:27.640
I think we need to have
a bit of a chinwag,

35:28.560 --> 35:29.800
don't you?

35:29.800 --> 35:32.120
I don't believe there's
anything left to be said.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.960
I've made my position quite clear.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.120
Yeah, well, I brought you
a coffee from the shop.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.960
It's an oat milk latte

35:38.960 --> 35:41.880
with a hefty jigger of almond syrup.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.880
- You brought me a coffee?
- Are you going to take it?

35:49.520 --> 35:51.480
- Shall I?
- Drink it?

35:52.320 --> 35:53.320
Of course.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.040
I've ingested things in my time, you know.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.760
It's... It's very nice.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.840
Yes, I should jolly well hope so.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.920
Well, we have things to talk about.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.120
Shall we take a little stroll?

36:08.120 --> 36:09.160
Um...

36:09.760 --> 36:12.080
Mm. Go on. They can't get any weirder.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.040
Oh.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.640
You should leave now too.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.040
The Metatron told me to wait.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.800
He said he might need me.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.160
Me! [chuckles] He might need me.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.640
Marvelous. Have a gold star.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.600
- They'll be back soon.
- Yes.

36:48.600 --> 36:52.160
When Aziraphale does come back,
I think we need a little us time.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.480
After all this, I think we are going for

36:57.160 --> 37:01.840
an extremely alcoholic breakfast
at the Ritz.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.040
Brilliant idea!

37:04.040 --> 37:06.160
Breakfast. Us time.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.160
Just us. Not you.

37:09.400 --> 37:12.320
Oh. [laughs] Oh, right, yes.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.800
I can, um, explore the bookshop.

37:16.480 --> 37:19.120
Um... you need to go.

37:20.440 --> 37:23.080
Can I... Can I take a book with me?

37:23.080 --> 37:25.320
I was looking at one earlier.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.480
They're like people, only portable.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.640
Go for it. Here, you'll like this one.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.760
- No, it won't do any good.
- It doesn't matter.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.680
We have to tell them.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.040
Fine.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.440
Anyone wants anything,
tell 'em we'll be back in five minutes.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.280
Okay.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.160
Tidied up.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.800
Where's the other one?
We need to talk to you.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.040
- He's out. Not a good time.
- I wasn't asking.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.480
There are things you need to hear.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.600
You and your... partner have been
messing about in our lives.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.400
We're not a game. We're real people.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.160
You can't just
pair us up for your amusement.

38:36.280 --> 38:39.400
You were crying
and Nina needed rescuing and--

38:39.400 --> 38:41.000
My relationship just ended.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I am not ready to start another one yet.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.320
I'd just be a rebound mess.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.960
I can't start seeing Maggie.

38:47.880 --> 38:51.680
When I'm ready, I hope she'll be there,
but there isn't any guarantee.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.760
- There is.
- You're not helping, angel.

38:54.840 --> 38:55.840
Look at you two.

38:56.200 --> 38:59.480
You're the hard bitten one,
the can't trust anyone ever again,

38:59.480 --> 39:02.640
and Mr. Wherever He Is is the soft one
who still believes in magic

39:02.760 --> 39:04.600
and people being
basically good and all that.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.400
Why are you telling me all this?
I don't understand.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.160
That's why she's telling you.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.960
Because you don't understand.

39:11.920 --> 39:15.360
Because you and Mr. Fell
don't ever talk to each other.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.000
We talk all the time!

39:17.000 --> 39:19.640
We've been talking for millions of years.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.600
Bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.560
I say something brilliant,
he says something

39:24.560 --> 39:26.400
unintentionally funny back. It's great.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.960
You never say what you're really thinking.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.280
That was all we needed.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.840
It's what you two need as well.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.160
Well, you don't have to
answer immediately.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.640
Take all the time you need.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.640
I... I don't know what to say.

39:44.920 --> 39:47.640
Well then, go and tell
your friend the good news.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.480
- We're just going.
- I'm sure you two have a lot to say.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.160
What's that you're holding, Muriel?

40:28.360 --> 40:29.520
A book.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.280
It's called a book.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.880
I'm "reading" a book.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.360
Excellent!

40:36.080 --> 40:38.480
What a perfectly splendid thing to do!

40:39.760 --> 40:41.120
Is it?

40:41.120 --> 40:44.440
Oh. [laughs] Yes. Jolly good.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.880
Look, I suppose, um...

40:50.880 --> 40:52.120
I've got something to say.

40:52.120 --> 40:54.160
I know we ought to be talking about...

40:54.160 --> 40:55.960
It's probably best
if I start off doing all the talking,

40:55.960 --> 40:58.040
you do all the listening,
'cause if I don't start talking now,

40:58.040 --> 40:59.800
I won't ever start talking, right?

40:59.800 --> 41:01.760
- Yes, so--
- What's that lovely human expression?

41:01.760 --> 41:04.320
Oh, yes! Hold that thought.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.680
You see, I...

41:05.800 --> 41:08.560
I have some incredibly
good news to give you.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.920
- Really?
- I... um...

41:12.160 --> 41:14.640
So, um...

41:14.640 --> 41:17.600
the Metatron, you know,
I don't think he's as bad a fellow--

41:17.600 --> 41:19.960
Well, I think I might've misjudged him.

41:19.960 --> 41:24.920
You see, I-- Well, he said, um,

41:24.920 --> 41:26.800
that Gabriel

41:26.800 --> 41:29.080
obviously hadn't worked out...

41:29.080 --> 41:32.640
as Supreme Archangel
and Commander of the Heavenly Host,

41:32.640 --> 41:35.280
and he asked who I thought
should take over in Heaven

41:35.280 --> 41:36.840
now that Gabriel was gone.

41:36.840 --> 41:37.920
And I said...

41:38.560 --> 41:42.200
- Michael?
- Oh, don't be silly! No, no, no, no, no.

41:42.320 --> 41:46.200
There's only one candidate
who makes even the slightest bit of sense.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.280
And that's you.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.840
And I said, "Me?"

41:52.440 --> 41:53.440
And he said...

41:53.440 --> 41:55.360
Well, yes. You're a leader,

41:55.360 --> 41:58.600
you're honest, you don't just tell people
what they want to hear.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.960
It's why Gabriel came to you
in the first place, I imagine.

42:03.560 --> 42:07.400
There are huge plans afoot,
enormous projects,

42:08.040 --> 42:10.320
and I will need you to run them.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.160
You are just the angel for the job.

42:14.920 --> 42:17.600
I... I don't want to go back to Heaven.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.080
Where would I get my coffee?

42:21.080 --> 42:24.040
You know, as Supreme Archangel,

42:24.040 --> 42:27.480
you would be able to decide
who to work with.

42:28.200 --> 42:31.160
Yeah, I've been looking back
over a number of your...

42:31.280 --> 42:34.400
previous exploits,
and I see that in quite a few of them

42:34.400 --> 42:37.400
you formed a <i>de facto</i> partnership

42:38.160 --> 42:39.760
with the demon Crowley.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.960
Now, if you wanted to
work with him again, that...

42:43.800 --> 42:45.680
might be considered irregular,

42:45.800 --> 42:48.880
but it would certainly be
within your jurisdiction

42:49.560 --> 42:52.800
to restore your friend, Crowley,

42:53.520 --> 42:56.600
to full angelic status.

42:56.600 --> 42:57.760
He said what?

42:58.520 --> 43:00.000
He said I could appoint you

43:00.880 --> 43:02.000
to be an angel.

43:02.800 --> 43:06.320
You could come back to Heaven and...

43:07.160 --> 43:08.480
and everything,

43:09.200 --> 43:10.600
like the old times.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.600
Only, even nicer.

43:14.840 --> 43:15.840
Right.

43:17.280 --> 43:19.520
And you told him
just where he could stick it, then?

43:22.520 --> 43:23.680
Not at all.

43:23.800 --> 43:27.040
Oh, we're better than that,
you're better than that, Angel!

43:27.040 --> 43:29.160
You don't need them.
I certainly don't need them!

43:29.280 --> 43:31.600
Look, they asked me
back to Hell, I said no.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.920
I'm not gonna be joining their team.
Neither should you.

43:33.920 --> 43:35.800
But... Well, obviously
you said no to Hell,

43:35.800 --> 43:36.920
you're the bad guys.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
But Heaven...

43:40.200 --> 43:43.560
Well, it's the side of truth, of light,

43:44.680 --> 43:45.800
of good.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.360
When Heaven ends life here on Earth,

43:50.360 --> 43:52.800
it'll be just as dead as if Hell ended it.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.200
Tell me you said no.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.520
Tell me you said no.

44:06.440 --> 44:07.880
If I'm in charge...

44:09.400 --> 44:10.840
I can make a difference.

44:12.240 --> 44:13.400
Oh.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.960
Oh, God. Right, okay.

44:15.960 --> 44:17.760
Right. I didn't get a chance to say
what I was going to say,

44:17.760 --> 44:18.960
I think I'd better say it now

44:18.960 --> 44:21.400
Right, okay, yes, so...

44:25.800 --> 44:27.360
We've known each other a long time.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.680
We've been on this planet for a long time.
I mean, you and me.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.240
I could always rely on you.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.680
You could always rely on me.
We're a team, a group.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.560
Group of the two of us.

44:41.560 --> 44:43.800
And we've spent our existence
pretending that we aren't.

44:47.680 --> 44:49.960
I mean, the last few years, not really.

44:55.240 --> 44:57.320
And I would like to spend...

44:59.560 --> 45:01.520
I mean, if Gabriel and Beelzebub

45:02.480 --> 45:05.040
can do it, go off together, then we can.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.320
Just the two of us. We don't need Heaven,

45:08.320 --> 45:10.560
we don't need Hell, they're toxic.

45:10.560 --> 45:13.640
We need to get away
from them, just be an us.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.800
- You and me, what do you say?
- Come with me...

45:18.200 --> 45:21.360
to Heaven. I'll run it,
you can be my second in command.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.880
We can make a difference.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.920
You can't leave this bookshop.

45:28.480 --> 45:30.120
Oh, Crowley.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.680
Nothing lasts forever.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.040
No.

45:41.080 --> 45:42.520
No, I don't suppose it does.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
Good luck.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.400
Good luck? Crowley!

45:50.400 --> 45:51.840
Crowley, come back,

45:52.640 --> 45:53.640
to Heaven!

45:55.080 --> 45:56.400
Work with me!

45:58.360 --> 45:59.560
We can be together!

45:59.560 --> 46:01.160
Angels...

46:02.400 --> 46:03.680
doing good!

46:06.600 --> 46:08.200
I... I need you!

46:13.360 --> 46:15.320
I don't think you understand
what I'm offering you.

46:15.320 --> 46:16.680
I understand.

46:19.040 --> 46:20.800
I think I understand
a whole lot better than you do.

46:23.080 --> 46:24.080
Well...

46:25.720 --> 46:27.040
then there's nothing more to say.

46:30.040 --> 46:31.040
Listen.

46:31.960 --> 46:32.960
Do you hear that?

46:35.120 --> 46:36.360
I don't hear anything.

46:37.840 --> 46:38.840
That's the point.

46:40.360 --> 46:41.440
No nightingales.

46:45.240 --> 46:46.440
You idiot.

46:46.440 --> 46:49.200
We could have been... us.

47:13.680 --> 47:14.680
I...

47:19.080 --> 47:20.360
I forgive you.

47:25.520 --> 47:26.520
Don't bother.

47:46.960 --> 47:48.200
How did he take it?

47:50.240 --> 47:52.320
Um, not well.

47:52.320 --> 47:55.360
Ah, well, always did want
to go his own way.

47:56.160 --> 47:59.080
Always asking damn
fool questions, too.

47:59.080 --> 48:01.240
Right, ready to start?

48:03.240 --> 48:04.240
I...

48:05.840 --> 48:06.840
But, um...

48:08.600 --> 48:09.600
my bookshop.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.480
Yes, well, for now

48:12.480 --> 48:14.960
I've entrusted it to Muriel,

48:14.960 --> 48:16.960
so it should be in good hands.

48:18.680 --> 48:19.760
But...

48:19.760 --> 48:22.840
Anything you need to take with you?

48:26.720 --> 48:27.720
No.

48:28.560 --> 48:29.800
Nothing I can think of.

48:30.960 --> 48:31.960
Ah.

48:36.320 --> 48:37.320
I think I...

48:46.560 --> 48:48.400
Nothing at all.

48:54.280 --> 48:57.000
Well,
I can't think of a better angel

48:57.000 --> 48:58.800
to wrap things up,

48:58.800 --> 49:00.800
and to set into motion

49:00.800 --> 49:03.600
the next step in the great plan.

49:03.600 --> 49:05.840
Um, yes, you mentioned that.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.440
Can I know what it is?

49:07.440 --> 49:11.000
Well, it's something we need
an angel of your talents to direct.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.960
An angel who is familiar with
how they do things on Earth.

49:14.960 --> 49:17.720
- Ah.
- We call it the Second Coming.
