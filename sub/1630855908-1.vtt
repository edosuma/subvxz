01:49.605 --> 01:51.038
Keeper!

01:51.105 --> 01:53.605
Welcome back to the Yellow Onion.

01:53.705 --> 01:56.438
It's an honor to do business
with you again.

01:59.971 --> 02:02.538
My bounty hunters
have searched high and low

02:02.605 --> 02:05.571
for this fine specimen of a Squiggler.

02:16.805 --> 02:18.305
It isn't big enough.

02:18.438 --> 02:20.038
He will not be pleased.

02:20.105 --> 02:24.505
I assure you that
this is the biggest Squiggler there is.

02:24.571 --> 02:25.705
My boys have...

02:25.771 --> 02:28.171
We are still waiting
on what you promised us.

02:33.771 --> 02:35.838
The Giant Octopus?

02:35.905 --> 02:39.438
But we have spent years looking
and there's no trace of it.

02:39.505 --> 02:40.638
It's a myth!

02:41.005 --> 02:42.638
Keeper, please. Don't ask...

02:42.705 --> 02:47.838
Find that octopus
or consider yourself finished.

03:03.605 --> 03:04.605
Alright!

03:04.705 --> 03:06.371
Who's up for another round?

03:08.138 --> 03:10.305
I think I'm tapped out.

03:11.438 --> 03:12.871
How about you, Egg?

03:17.405 --> 03:22.071
In hindsight perhaps getting a loan
from Chihoohoo wasn't the greatest idea.

03:24.205 --> 03:25.838
How much do we owe him now?

03:26.505 --> 03:27.538
Idiots!

03:27.605 --> 03:29.071
Do you want to make some money?

03:29.371 --> 03:33.405
There's a big reward for anyone
who can find me the giant octopus.

03:37.605 --> 03:40.238
See? I told you
everything would work out.

03:41.038 --> 03:42.638
So, fellows,

03:42.705 --> 03:46.405
what do you say
we play just one more round?

05:42.338 --> 05:44.671
Morning! Come on in!

05:46.671 --> 05:49.371
Okay, I'm up!

05:51.171 --> 05:52.905
Check out what I built last night.

05:58.738 --> 06:02.605
So I decided to play around
with the spectral ranges of sea glass

06:02.671 --> 06:04.571
to test their reflection levels.

06:08.971 --> 06:11.905
I wanted to use
the leftover sea glass for something

06:12.371 --> 06:14.371
since it didn't work
with the light beamer.

06:15.271 --> 06:19.605
I just know if I had the right crystal
I could intensify its power tenfold.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.138
I could help the whole Peninsula.

06:24.505 --> 06:26.971
In the meantime, are you ready to see?

06:29.738 --> 06:31.338
Could I borrow some of your light?

06:32.871 --> 06:33.871
Great!

06:33.938 --> 06:35.305
You go here.

06:35.371 --> 06:38.171
Okay, and...

06:39.038 --> 06:40.471
Here we go!

06:57.871 --> 06:59.405
Arkie?

06:59.471 --> 07:00.738
Time to get up!

07:00.805 --> 07:01.938
Coming, Dad!

07:06.105 --> 07:07.238
Let's go!

07:10.238 --> 07:11.938
Nothing to it but to do it!

07:26.738 --> 07:28.071
No!

07:35.405 --> 07:37.105
I've still got to stick that landing.

07:54.838 --> 07:56.071
Dad's been busy.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.171
- Good morning, Arkie!
- Good morning, Dad!

08:28.338 --> 08:31.338
Come on! It's practice time.

08:33.071 --> 08:34.505
Great.

08:35.438 --> 08:38.805
I know it's hard,
but you just need to keep trying.

08:39.271 --> 08:41.871
You know, dad, repeating the same task

08:41.938 --> 08:45.205
and expecting different results
isn't a great life plan.

08:45.938 --> 08:48.038
Don't give me that, smarty-pants.

08:48.138 --> 08:50.605
You'll be reviving plants in no time.

08:50.671 --> 08:53.538
That's what you keep saying
over and over...

08:53.605 --> 08:55.938
Yes, yes, yes. Don't give up, kiddo.

08:56.671 --> 08:57.838
For me.

09:20.071 --> 09:21.371
I'm sorry, Dad.

09:22.005 --> 09:23.438
I just can't do it.

09:23.505 --> 09:26.238
Arkie, we just need to keep trying.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.638
That beam.

09:41.705 --> 09:45.271
That beam is destroying
all life on the Peninsula.

09:46.505 --> 09:50.638
If they don't stop soon
this planet won't last much longer.

09:50.705 --> 09:54.071
But who would create something
that does that?

09:54.371 --> 09:56.505
Perhaps they don't know
what they're doing.

09:56.871 --> 10:00.105
- If we went there and told them...
- We can't go there, Arkie.

10:00.571 --> 10:03.771
The creatures in the city
use machines to drain the sun.

10:03.838 --> 10:06.405
- They're dangerous and selfish.
- But...

10:06.471 --> 10:10.505
They're different to us.
They don't see the world like we do.

10:11.471 --> 10:13.438
It's safer if we stay here.

10:14.271 --> 10:15.371
Trust me.

10:23.171 --> 10:24.471
But what do I always say?

10:24.971 --> 10:27.171
There's always something you can do...

10:27.238 --> 10:30.071
- To make the world better.
- To make the world better.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.305
Exactly!

10:31.371 --> 10:32.738
So come on, kiddo.

10:32.805 --> 10:34.705
Let's go help these plants.

10:49.505 --> 10:51.138
Good morning, everyone!

10:54.271 --> 10:57.338
Alrighty, let's get you all charged up.

10:59.905 --> 11:02.138
- Arkie, could you...?
- Already on it!

11:12.105 --> 11:13.705
Dad?

11:13.771 --> 11:17.371
Do you ever think that maybe
not all machines are bad?

11:17.705 --> 11:21.405
I bet they could even help us
intensify the sun's beams.

11:21.471 --> 11:24.538
Arkie, you know how I feel about this.

11:24.705 --> 11:26.671
Machines are dangerous.

11:26.738 --> 11:29.471
But aren't the mirrors
a kind of machine?

11:29.538 --> 11:31.638
And they help the plants.

11:32.138 --> 11:35.105
Well, no, the mirrors
don't take from the sun.

11:35.171 --> 11:37.238
They only amplify what's already there.

11:38.038 --> 11:41.671
And they're powered by our
very own impressive muscles,

11:41.738 --> 11:44.538
not unnatural gadgets and gizmos.

11:44.605 --> 11:47.305
- But I really...
- It's just not the same thing.

11:48.271 --> 11:51.571
Besides we are octopuses.

11:51.638 --> 11:55.238
We're far more impressive
than any piece of technology.

11:56.638 --> 11:58.205
Or at least you are.

12:08.971 --> 12:10.005
Do you know what?

12:10.071 --> 12:13.271
I think it's time for you
to take on a little more responsibility.

12:13.805 --> 12:15.538
Wait. What?

12:16.805 --> 12:18.371
Are you sure I'm ready?

12:19.038 --> 12:22.471
- Maybe we could practice a bit more...
- We can't practice forever, Arkie.

12:23.171 --> 12:24.638
What is it you always say?

12:25.138 --> 12:28.805
There's nothing to it, so just do it.

12:29.405 --> 12:31.905
Yes. Something like that.

12:42.271 --> 12:44.405
Don't worry. You'll be great.

12:48.905 --> 12:50.138
Remember what we learnt.

12:50.471 --> 12:55.405
Hold steady, stay focused
and move the wheel slowly.

12:57.471 --> 12:58.705
You've got this, kiddo.

13:07.938 --> 13:10.205
That's it. Keep it steady.

13:12.638 --> 13:14.338
And here we go!

13:29.771 --> 13:32.571
Okay, little ones, keep the line moving.

13:32.638 --> 13:34.138
Once you're fully charged up,

13:34.205 --> 13:37.271
go out there
and give those plants some sun.

13:48.038 --> 13:49.305
Okay, Arkie.

13:49.371 --> 13:50.671
We need a little more light.

13:50.738 --> 13:53.971
So let's lift that mirror very slowly.

13:57.638 --> 14:00.538
I can't hold it!

14:02.138 --> 14:03.438
Are you okay back there?

14:03.505 --> 14:05.205
Let me know if you need a hand.

14:08.005 --> 14:09.438
My tentacle!

14:09.505 --> 14:10.838
It's slipping!

14:32.005 --> 14:34.171
Arkie, where are you going?

14:35.138 --> 14:37.505
Somewhere I can't mess anything else up.

15:09.571 --> 15:10.738
Hey, Steve.

15:11.271 --> 15:12.438
I'm okay.

15:13.005 --> 15:16.738
I just wish I could convince dad
that machines aren't all bad.

15:17.205 --> 15:18.871
Show him what I can do.

15:41.571 --> 15:42.638
This.

15:42.705 --> 15:46.138
This is exactly what I need
to finish the light beamer.

15:47.705 --> 15:49.838
Come on, Steve. We've got work to do.

16:05.705 --> 16:08.338
Find me a mythical creature
that doesn't exist!

16:09.138 --> 16:10.705
Who does the Keeper think she is?

16:10.771 --> 16:13.105
We've already searched
this planet ten times over.

16:13.638 --> 16:15.938
It's not out here!

16:20.038 --> 16:23.638
We're more likely to find brain cells
in River Bandit's head, boss?

16:26.771 --> 16:28.271
I have brain cells...

16:28.638 --> 16:29.671
Hello?

16:29.738 --> 16:32.471
Bunniguru and Egg reporting for duty.

16:34.405 --> 16:38.305
- Hello? Chihoohoo?
- Not those two again.

16:38.371 --> 16:40.205
Yes. Keep up the good work.

16:41.971 --> 16:45.271
Boss, why are you letting
the rabbit tag along?

16:45.605 --> 16:48.571
Because when it turns out I was right
and there is no octopus

16:48.738 --> 16:50.871
we can blame it
on those two knuckleheads.

16:50.938 --> 16:53.938
Okay, let's do one more sweep
and then we can get out of this dump.

16:55.271 --> 16:57.171
Hello, Chihoohoo.

16:58.271 --> 16:59.405
He's probably busy.

17:01.971 --> 17:04.038
Take it all in, Egg.

17:04.371 --> 17:07.238
Excitement, adventure, per diems!

17:07.305 --> 17:11.005
We're in the open skies
heading to far-off lands

17:11.071 --> 17:13.971
searching for a rare and wild creature.

17:14.038 --> 17:17.171
The promise of huge stacks of money
at our fingertips.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.905
This is really going to turn things
around for us, buddy.

17:20.971 --> 17:22.738
I can feel it.

17:53.571 --> 17:55.371
Twice in one day?

17:55.638 --> 17:58.338
Maybee, what are you up to?

18:05.771 --> 18:07.371
Arkie, are you there?

18:07.905 --> 18:08.938
Arkie!

18:10.105 --> 18:11.738
Where are you, Arkie?

18:13.638 --> 18:14.771
Arkie!

18:20.138 --> 18:21.271
Arkie!

18:25.938 --> 18:27.171
Dad?

18:34.571 --> 18:39.338
Okay, if this baby works
it'll definitely change dad's mind.

18:39.871 --> 18:41.338
This way, please.

18:41.405 --> 18:43.905
One super-charged glowbug coming up!

18:50.005 --> 18:52.571
Nothing to it but to do it.

19:00.371 --> 19:01.771
Come on.

19:06.271 --> 19:07.571
Please work.

19:10.205 --> 19:11.205
Yes!

19:17.771 --> 19:19.071
Here we go!

19:21.471 --> 19:22.905
Almost there!

19:33.505 --> 19:35.005
Come on, open!

19:37.371 --> 19:38.371
Steve!

19:45.971 --> 19:47.638
Arkie, are you in here?

19:52.105 --> 19:53.105
Arkie!

19:57.771 --> 20:00.405
The light! It burns!

20:00.938 --> 20:04.105
- Turn right!
- Which way is right?

20:07.771 --> 20:09.471
Egg, make it stop!

20:14.871 --> 20:15.938
Carrots!

20:17.505 --> 20:18.771
Collision ahead.

20:18.838 --> 20:20.238
Pull up.

20:20.571 --> 20:21.705
Don't worry, Egg.

20:22.071 --> 20:23.471
I've got this.

20:27.838 --> 20:30.438
And here we go!

20:34.238 --> 20:35.238
Collision ahead.

20:35.771 --> 20:36.805
Pull up.

20:43.771 --> 20:45.071
Yes!

20:52.005 --> 20:53.071
Egg?

21:08.005 --> 21:09.038
Steve?

21:09.405 --> 21:10.838
I can't turn it off!

21:39.305 --> 21:40.305
Steve!

21:43.905 --> 21:45.105
Steve!

22:08.138 --> 22:10.005
What was that light?

22:10.905 --> 22:12.338
Spin us around, Rebel King.

22:12.405 --> 22:13.905
I want to see what's over there.

22:23.171 --> 22:24.171
Wait.

22:25.271 --> 22:27.505
Is that an octopus?

22:28.805 --> 22:31.438
That is one huge Squiggler.

22:32.271 --> 22:33.438
It's an octopus!

22:37.771 --> 22:39.571
We found one, boys!

22:53.971 --> 22:55.705
What are you waiting for?

22:55.771 --> 22:56.871
Go get him!

23:18.738 --> 23:20.305
I've got you!

23:36.805 --> 23:38.171
That's it!

23:38.238 --> 23:40.838
I'm going to skewer this sucker!

23:42.671 --> 23:45.471
The bounty
is for a live octopus, you moron!

23:45.538 --> 23:47.971
If the creature dies, we all die.

23:48.038 --> 23:50.371
- Stop him, Rebel King.
- On it, boss.

23:52.505 --> 23:55.438
Come here, little calamari!

23:57.405 --> 23:58.471
What?

24:07.205 --> 24:08.338
No!

24:14.238 --> 24:17.238
Looks like I got me a mythical beast.

24:17.338 --> 24:19.238
Victory!

24:19.338 --> 24:20.405
Yes!

24:40.571 --> 24:41.738
What the hell?

24:43.705 --> 24:46.638
Have you ever seen anything like them?

24:47.938 --> 24:49.371
That one is so cute!

24:52.371 --> 24:53.571
Can I say hi?

24:53.905 --> 24:57.071
No, they're strangers.
I should tell dad.

24:58.238 --> 25:01.938
But they don't exactly look dangerous.

25:03.838 --> 25:06.905
And they're clearly
have no idea what they're doing.

25:07.405 --> 25:10.438
This isn't working!

25:12.671 --> 25:16.138
In fact, they look downright hopeless.

25:16.205 --> 25:19.138
Do you know
what this situation calls for?

25:19.205 --> 25:22.471
My trusty Book of Proverbs.

25:25.538 --> 25:27.038
- Here is a good one.
- Yes.

25:27.271 --> 25:28.305
I'm going to do it.

25:29.005 --> 25:31.471
Embrace surprises like a hot fish.

25:31.871 --> 25:32.971
With tongs.

25:33.038 --> 25:34.238
Okay, here I go.

25:34.305 --> 25:36.071
I love surprises.

25:42.871 --> 25:46.138
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

25:46.538 --> 25:47.671
Scared?

25:47.738 --> 25:50.071
No. We are fine.

25:50.338 --> 25:51.738
Are you sure?

25:51.805 --> 25:54.405
Totally. Undoubtedly. No problem.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.971
Bunniguru, at your service.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.671
Philosopher. Renaissance rabbit.

25:59.738 --> 26:02.638
And a little exploring on the side
to make ends meet.

26:03.705 --> 26:05.605
This is my travelling companion,

26:05.671 --> 26:08.871
co-pilot and general good egg, Egg.

26:11.238 --> 26:13.571
She's a little unwell right now.

26:13.938 --> 26:16.605
Normally she's a bit of a "crack-up".

26:17.071 --> 26:18.071
Get it?

26:20.271 --> 26:21.505
Yes, I deserved that.

26:22.471 --> 26:25.605
Once we get her back to the city,
she'll be her old self again.

26:26.071 --> 26:27.571
The city?

26:27.905 --> 26:30.005
Did you fly from there in this?

26:30.071 --> 26:31.505
Yes.

26:31.571 --> 26:35.105
This trusty metal stallion
has never failed us.

26:38.038 --> 26:40.438
Well, until now.

26:44.005 --> 26:45.738
I didn't introduce myself.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.538
I'm Arkie.

26:49.838 --> 26:52.571
Is that a... tentacle?

26:53.005 --> 26:55.905
Yes, but it doesn't work very well.

26:56.238 --> 26:57.671
It's not like my dad's.

26:57.738 --> 26:59.305
He's a real octopus.

26:59.371 --> 27:01.971
Your dad is an octopus?

27:02.038 --> 27:03.038
Yes.

27:03.105 --> 27:05.038
I wish he was here to see this.

27:05.105 --> 27:08.238
Even he'd have to admit
this is amazing.

27:08.305 --> 27:11.238
I mean, look at all these parts!

27:11.805 --> 27:13.171
And what is that?

27:16.238 --> 27:21.705
So, Egg and I are on a bit
of an explorer's holiday.

27:21.771 --> 27:24.205
And we've never met a real octopus.

27:25.238 --> 27:28.171
We'd love to say hello
before we head home.

27:28.905 --> 27:30.505
You're going back to the city?

27:30.805 --> 27:31.805
Today?

27:47.171 --> 27:48.971
What was that?

27:49.638 --> 27:51.171
I've got to get home!

27:54.371 --> 27:56.205
Chihoohoo left without us!

27:57.271 --> 27:58.605
That must mean...

28:11.571 --> 28:12.971
What is all this?

28:16.971 --> 28:18.205
No.

28:32.405 --> 28:33.471
Dad!

28:39.171 --> 28:40.205
Dad!

28:43.238 --> 28:44.305
Dad!

29:09.371 --> 29:11.371
This is all my fault.

29:12.405 --> 29:14.671
If I hadn't built this...

29:15.438 --> 29:18.905
Sorry, kid.
It looks like someone took him.

29:18.971 --> 29:20.671
Who would do that?

29:20.738 --> 29:24.671
I don't know for certain,
but that looked like a city ship.

29:24.738 --> 29:26.405
They're probably taking him there.

29:26.905 --> 29:28.071
Right, Egg?

29:41.471 --> 29:42.971
You're heading that way, right?

29:56.005 --> 29:57.138
See, Egg?

29:57.605 --> 29:59.538
Everything always works out.

30:00.338 --> 30:02.405
We might not have the octopus,

30:02.471 --> 30:05.805
but here we have
the very next best thing.

30:05.871 --> 30:08.238
A tentacle to trade in for a reward.

30:09.905 --> 30:11.271
I know.

30:11.605 --> 30:16.671
But with our debt and your new crack
we have to go back with something.

30:17.038 --> 30:18.838
It's looking serious.

30:19.971 --> 30:21.205
Are you coming?

30:21.371 --> 30:22.571
Coming!

30:36.438 --> 30:38.438
Are you sure you both know the way?

30:39.138 --> 30:40.538
Absolutely!

30:40.605 --> 30:43.405
Egg and I have natural
navigational instincts.

30:43.738 --> 30:49.138
We could find a pebble
in a sea of similar looking pebbles.

30:58.205 --> 31:02.105
You know, I've never left
the Peninsula before.

31:03.805 --> 31:05.271
What was I thinking?

31:05.538 --> 31:07.338
How am I meant to find my dad?

31:08.638 --> 31:10.971
Well, it's not like
you're doing it alone.

31:11.471 --> 31:14.671
Egg and I will help you
one hundred percent of the way.

31:19.605 --> 31:20.905
Goodbye, you three.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.571
Keep an eye on the plants
while I'm gone.

31:25.171 --> 31:27.005
Okay, let's do this.

31:39.338 --> 31:43.405
Good morning, my dear citizens
of the City of Light.

31:43.471 --> 31:47.038
Remember, every day is a new opportunity

31:47.105 --> 31:49.938
to be a better version of yourself.

31:50.538 --> 31:53.505
To eliminate the flaws
that hold you back.

31:54.505 --> 31:57.638
I can make you magnificent.

32:20.571 --> 32:21.805
You found one?

32:23.671 --> 32:24.871
Let me see it.

32:28.605 --> 32:29.605
It'll have to do.

32:30.005 --> 32:31.438
Put it in the machine.

32:43.205 --> 32:47.205
Initiating DNA test number 3851.

32:49.338 --> 32:50.838
Crystal activated.

32:51.071 --> 32:53.705
Initiating solar energy extraction.

32:55.205 --> 32:57.805
Generating human genome sequence.

33:15.905 --> 33:18.405
Initializing DNA reconstruction.

33:39.071 --> 33:41.371
Life form reconstruction failed.

33:42.338 --> 33:44.738
This squiggler is never
going to be strong enough.

33:45.071 --> 33:47.538
I need that octopus.

33:47.638 --> 33:50.771
I've sent Chihoohoo on another
full scout of the planet.

33:50.838 --> 33:54.905
It's been made clear what he'll lose
if he returns empty-handed.

33:55.605 --> 33:57.738
It is imperative that we find him.

33:57.938 --> 33:59.305
Do you understand?

34:02.071 --> 34:04.538
He's the only thing
that can bring her back.

34:10.538 --> 34:14.638
Who's got two thumbs
and just found what you are looking for?

34:16.238 --> 34:17.671
This guy!

34:18.438 --> 34:19.505
Me!

34:38.538 --> 34:39.705
Keeper!

34:40.005 --> 34:42.071
So nice to see you again.

34:42.138 --> 34:44.005
I like what you've done with the place.

34:44.071 --> 34:46.538
It's very overlord chic.

34:47.405 --> 34:50.138
Show me this octopus.

35:13.738 --> 35:15.005
It's really him!

35:16.538 --> 35:21.405
I believe there is a little matter
of a sizeable reward?

35:22.038 --> 35:23.071
It's done.

35:26.105 --> 35:27.438
Thank you, Keeper.

35:27.971 --> 35:30.405
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

35:49.805 --> 35:51.105
You know, kid.

35:51.471 --> 35:55.971
I have just the thing
to pass the time on long trips.

35:57.838 --> 36:02.105
You'll never get lost
when your shoes are made of breadcrumbs.

36:03.771 --> 36:04.771
Shoes.

36:12.905 --> 36:14.138
Wait for me!

36:18.271 --> 36:21.305
Trespassers!

36:23.471 --> 36:25.571
Did you hear that?

36:30.305 --> 36:33.738
Filthy trespassers!

36:54.438 --> 36:55.705
Put me down!

36:58.705 --> 36:59.971
Bunniguru!

37:00.238 --> 37:01.705
Egg!

37:46.205 --> 37:47.205
Arkie?

37:49.105 --> 37:50.171
Dad?

37:56.338 --> 37:59.271
Hang on, I'm coming!

38:12.538 --> 38:13.571
Arkie!

38:43.838 --> 38:44.838
Arkie.

38:46.171 --> 38:47.505
Let me help you.

39:29.038 --> 39:30.371
What just happened?

39:30.671 --> 39:34.005
Incoming!

39:36.471 --> 39:37.871
Don't worry, kid.

39:37.938 --> 39:41.138
I've got everything under control.

39:48.171 --> 39:52.838
How dare you trespass
on our secret ground?

39:52.905 --> 39:57.938
Your punishment will be
to feed the Tree of Knowledge.

39:58.205 --> 39:59.538
That's not so bad.

40:00.171 --> 40:02.038
With your souls!

40:03.505 --> 40:06.138
Stop! Don't hurt them.

40:09.738 --> 40:11.171
Why shouldn't I?

40:11.471 --> 40:15.905
Creatures like you are stealing our sun
and killing my Tree!

40:15.971 --> 40:17.138
Wait, no!

40:17.205 --> 40:18.938
It tried to eat me!

40:19.305 --> 40:20.338
What?

40:27.471 --> 40:29.071
Wait a minute.

40:29.138 --> 40:32.438
You're telling me you gave her a vision.

40:34.271 --> 40:35.371
Really?

40:35.438 --> 40:36.905
You're unbelievable!

40:36.971 --> 40:39.905
If this is a bad time, we can just...

40:41.271 --> 40:43.705
Or we'll stay right here.
That works too.

40:44.438 --> 40:48.938
The all-powerful Tree of Knowledge
says you have capacity

40:49.005 --> 40:51.071
for great destruction.

40:51.571 --> 40:53.605
You mean what happened on the Peninsula?

40:53.671 --> 40:56.071
No, I was trying to help!

40:56.305 --> 40:57.671
I didn't mean to.

40:58.571 --> 41:00.905
Wait, what's the Tree of Knowledge?

41:02.305 --> 41:03.405
Hear that?

41:03.471 --> 41:05.471
She doesn't even know who you are.

41:06.305 --> 41:10.071
The Tree is connected to all things

41:10.138 --> 41:14.071
and can see all things.

41:14.138 --> 41:17.371
It knows everything that has passed

41:17.438 --> 41:21.105
and everything that could possibly come.

41:21.771 --> 41:24.605
And I wonder
why it's gotten such a big head!

41:25.071 --> 41:29.271
So the things I saw are real?

41:29.338 --> 41:30.338
No!

41:30.571 --> 41:32.371
Well, not literally.

41:32.871 --> 41:36.771
It only shows an important moment
in your future.

41:36.838 --> 41:39.371
A version of your path.

41:39.438 --> 41:41.771
It's up to you what you do with it.

41:42.371 --> 41:45.071
Okay, but what did it mean?

41:45.638 --> 41:46.938
Well I don't know!

41:47.005 --> 41:49.405
It gets very cryptic when it's tired.

41:49.705 --> 41:50.971
But none of that matters!

41:51.471 --> 41:54.805
You'll never escape the forest.

41:54.871 --> 41:58.738
The creatures here are very angry and...

42:00.671 --> 42:04.271
Well, you're certainly
going to a lot of trouble for this one.

42:05.871 --> 42:07.471
Alright!

42:08.505 --> 42:11.371
You will be given safe transport

42:11.438 --> 42:14.971
by the Great Tempest of Leaves.

42:15.271 --> 42:19.005
Which apparently we can spare
for any old person now.

42:19.305 --> 42:20.605
Double standards.

42:31.538 --> 42:35.871
The forest warns you
to choose your path wisely.

42:35.938 --> 42:38.405
Very wisely.

42:49.171 --> 42:51.305
I hope you're right about this one.

43:07.838 --> 43:10.238
Hello again, Blister.

43:11.705 --> 43:13.105
Maybee.

43:14.371 --> 43:16.538
Twelve years is a long time to hide.

43:16.871 --> 43:21.171
I hope you haven't lost
your abilities in your old age.

43:25.871 --> 43:27.838
Keeper, bring me a citizen.

43:28.171 --> 43:29.405
Any citizen will do.

43:29.638 --> 43:32.305
I want to make sure
the transformation process is perfect

43:32.371 --> 43:34.538
before I run the final experiment.

43:36.638 --> 43:39.205
So I can finally bring her back.

43:59.771 --> 44:02.338
Are you doing alright?

44:02.938 --> 44:05.305
Not too shellshocked
after what just happened?

44:08.738 --> 44:10.205
Is she okay?

44:10.271 --> 44:11.671
Yes, of course.

44:11.871 --> 44:14.771
She's just not used
to flying without a seatbelt.

44:16.338 --> 44:17.905
Have you been friends for long?

44:17.971 --> 44:20.205
Pretty much forever, thankfully.

44:20.271 --> 44:23.605
She has this habit
of bringing out the best in me.

44:24.171 --> 44:27.805
And I certainly think her life
is more exciting when I'm around.

44:29.205 --> 44:30.205
Don't you worry.

44:30.271 --> 44:33.071
We're going to find my dad
and we'll get Egg fixed up.

44:54.105 --> 44:56.405
- Is that...?
- It sure is, kid!

44:56.471 --> 44:58.671
The City of Light!

45:04.838 --> 45:06.238
Thank you!

45:06.305 --> 45:08.138
We appreciate the ride!

45:15.671 --> 45:18.471
How are we going to get in there?

45:20.205 --> 45:21.571
Darn vent!

45:24.405 --> 45:25.571
Let me have a go.

45:27.138 --> 45:29.138
Now let's see.

45:43.605 --> 45:44.938
Good job, kid!

45:45.971 --> 45:48.905
- Only first-class travel for us.
- What?

45:48.971 --> 45:52.005
Everybody out of the way!

45:52.138 --> 45:56.171
Nothing to it but to do it!

46:07.705 --> 46:09.705
Welcome to the city, kid!

46:09.805 --> 46:12.838
Where anything is possible.

46:17.038 --> 46:19.038
It smells like garbage.

46:19.105 --> 46:20.571
That's not garbage.

46:20.638 --> 46:23.638
That is the odor of opportunity.

46:23.705 --> 46:25.905
It's the je ne sais quoi of the city.

46:25.971 --> 46:26.971
The...

46:28.405 --> 46:30.438
No, actually, that's just garbage.

46:30.671 --> 46:32.705
That smell is just rotten garbage.

46:36.105 --> 46:38.371
What kind of maniac
would throw this away?

46:40.538 --> 46:42.138
What's out there?

46:43.705 --> 46:47.005
Kid, you can't just go
charging out there!

46:47.071 --> 46:48.538
It's not safe!

46:48.671 --> 46:51.905
We need to come up with a plan.

46:52.538 --> 46:54.371
Okay?

46:57.205 --> 46:58.205
Got it!

46:58.271 --> 47:02.705
My handy Book of Proverbs
will have all the answers.

47:04.371 --> 47:05.438
What do you mean?

47:05.505 --> 47:08.605
The book
is an all-powerful oracle that...

47:08.671 --> 47:10.538
Well, then, what do you want to do?

47:34.171 --> 47:36.471
It's beautiful!

47:36.905 --> 47:39.271
There's so many creatures!

47:40.838 --> 47:42.971
There's so many creatures.

47:43.438 --> 47:45.671
How will I ever find dad?

47:48.005 --> 47:50.405
Good evening, my dear citizens.

47:50.771 --> 47:55.471
Here, in my wonderful City of Light
I strive to help you

47:55.538 --> 47:57.871
become the epitome of perfection.

47:57.938 --> 48:02.638
And today I offer you
an extraordinary opportunity.

48:03.071 --> 48:04.305
It's him!

48:04.671 --> 48:09.438
Tonight I will make someone live up
to their full potential.

48:09.838 --> 48:14.438
Our poor friend has spent their life
struggling with wings that can't fly,

48:14.505 --> 48:16.371
legs that slow them down

48:17.405 --> 48:19.505
and a fin that sends them off-course.

48:19.971 --> 48:23.871
But after tonight,
they will struggle no more.

48:30.671 --> 48:33.205
Thanks to new resources at my disposal

48:34.038 --> 48:38.638
I can now transform you
into who you always wanted to be.

49:08.938 --> 49:14.171
Don't forget, my dear friends.
I can make you magnificent.

49:19.005 --> 49:21.705
- Magnificent...
- Is what I would be...

49:21.771 --> 49:23.505
- If I wasn't...
- Stuck...

49:23.571 --> 49:24.605
- With you!
- With you!

49:24.671 --> 49:25.738
- Get off!
- Get off!

49:25.805 --> 49:27.571
- No!
- Don't touch me!

49:27.838 --> 49:30.738
The second I get enough money...

49:30.805 --> 49:34.271
I'm paying Dr. Maybee to get you off me!

49:34.338 --> 49:37.071
No, I'm getting you off me!

49:38.138 --> 49:40.438
And you'd better not start cry...

49:40.905 --> 49:41.971
Look!

49:43.771 --> 49:45.238
- A tentacle!
- A tentacle!

49:49.405 --> 49:51.105
Hello, little girl!

49:51.338 --> 49:52.738
Are you lost?

49:54.038 --> 49:57.305
No, I'm just waiting for my friends.

49:57.638 --> 50:00.571
Friends? We can be friends with you!

50:02.405 --> 50:04.205
And with your tentacle!

50:06.771 --> 50:09.238
Let go of my tentacle!

50:09.305 --> 50:13.771
Tentacle!

50:14.271 --> 50:15.438
Tentacle?

50:16.271 --> 50:17.338
Arkie!

50:21.271 --> 50:22.905
Is that a tentacle?

50:22.971 --> 50:25.371
Mind your own business! She is mine!

50:25.438 --> 50:27.271
Yes, mind your own business!

50:27.338 --> 50:29.671
Stop it! You were never a part of this!

50:29.738 --> 50:32.305
I've been here the whole time!

50:45.271 --> 50:46.905
- Excuse me!
- Get out of the way!

50:46.971 --> 50:48.338
Coming through! Sorry!

50:48.405 --> 50:49.538
Get back here!

50:53.071 --> 50:54.838
- Excuse me.
- Get out of the way.

51:01.471 --> 51:02.771
Arkie!

51:02.838 --> 51:04.705
Over here, kid!

51:04.771 --> 51:06.705
Come down, little girl.

51:07.505 --> 51:08.705
We don't bite.

51:28.571 --> 51:29.571
Arkie!

51:36.138 --> 51:37.571
Thanks, Bunni.

51:55.638 --> 51:58.305
Egg, we can't keep hiding her.

51:58.705 --> 52:00.371
We need to do this.

52:05.171 --> 52:06.505
What was that?

52:06.771 --> 52:09.205
Why did they keep talking
about my tentacle?

52:10.271 --> 52:12.605
Well, who knows
why anyone does anything?

52:14.038 --> 52:15.938
Bunniguru, what aren't you telling me?

52:18.871 --> 52:21.905
The thing is, kid, tentacles are...

52:23.171 --> 52:25.038
They are rare.

52:25.905 --> 52:28.405
They have a kind of bounty on them
in the city.

52:28.738 --> 52:30.871
Bounty? Why?

52:31.305 --> 52:33.405
People will pay big rewards for them.

52:34.771 --> 52:37.138
And when you live
in a place like this...

52:38.305 --> 52:40.571
you do stuff you're not proud of.

52:52.371 --> 52:55.838
What did you say you were looking for
on the Peninsula again?

52:59.071 --> 53:01.238
Kid, the truth is...

53:03.271 --> 53:04.305
Egg!

53:04.771 --> 53:05.905
Egg?

53:21.105 --> 53:24.405
I'm going to find Egg some help
so just stay here

53:24.471 --> 53:25.971
and look after her, okay?

53:30.905 --> 53:32.005
Bunniguru?

53:33.005 --> 53:36.138
You're going to ask
about my dad too, right?

53:37.305 --> 53:38.371
Sure.

53:38.905 --> 53:40.138
Sure, kid.

54:08.005 --> 54:10.138
Where are you, Chihoohoo?

54:10.471 --> 54:12.805
Otto, give me another onion sour.

54:13.771 --> 54:16.638
Okay, let's get this over with.

54:17.238 --> 54:18.605
Boss!

54:19.171 --> 54:21.838
I found another two Squigglers
stashed out the back.

54:23.071 --> 54:26.138
I wonder what she does
with all these Squigglers.

54:26.971 --> 54:30.805
I reckon she chops their tentacles up
and throws them in a stew.

54:32.238 --> 54:34.205
Fries them in butter!

54:34.838 --> 54:39.271
- With a little bit of sage!
- And a pop of lemon!

54:43.305 --> 54:44.738
What am I doing?

54:45.005 --> 54:46.505
I can't do this to Arkie.

54:46.871 --> 54:48.338
I have to get her out of the city.

54:50.338 --> 54:53.538
Arkie! What are you doing here?

54:53.605 --> 54:55.805
Look, I just want to find out
where my dad is.

54:57.371 --> 55:01.371
I know where to find him.
You just have to be quiet.

55:01.438 --> 55:03.638
- Come on!
- You know where he is?

55:06.438 --> 55:08.071
Quick! This way!

55:12.571 --> 55:13.571
Egg!

55:23.805 --> 55:26.338
Eat some greens, River Bandit.

55:27.138 --> 55:29.738
This time it wasn't me, boss.

55:34.471 --> 55:35.571
Tentacle!

55:35.638 --> 55:37.605
Tentacle.

55:38.605 --> 55:40.171
Bunniguru.

55:40.971 --> 55:43.005
We need to get Arkie out of here!

55:43.071 --> 55:44.771
Bunni, what's going on?

55:45.271 --> 55:46.905
Get me that girl!

55:48.571 --> 55:49.871
Could you make it upstairs?

55:53.638 --> 55:56.538
Chihoohoo, over here, you mutts!

55:59.571 --> 56:00.805
Tentacle!

56:02.338 --> 56:03.371
Spread out!

56:03.438 --> 56:04.938
Don't let the bounty escape.

56:06.805 --> 56:08.705
Coming for you.

56:10.471 --> 56:14.838
If ever there was a moment
for some good advice it would be now.

56:20.271 --> 56:22.338
Bunniguru.

56:24.071 --> 56:27.838
Looks like you brought me back
a little souvenir from the Peninsula.

56:29.071 --> 56:30.538
I don't know what you mean.

56:34.205 --> 56:36.238
Bunni, don't be like that.

56:36.638 --> 56:38.838
Tell me, who's the girl?

56:42.271 --> 56:44.238
She's not for sale.

56:44.838 --> 56:46.871
You haven't even heard my offer.

56:47.005 --> 56:48.805
But she's really not worth anything.

56:50.071 --> 56:52.305
She's defective and doesn't floss.

56:54.471 --> 56:56.738
Don't be cute, Bunniguru.

56:57.005 --> 56:59.205
You owe me a lot of money.

56:59.671 --> 57:02.138
And you also
need to stop your little friend

57:02.205 --> 57:05.671
from coughing up sulphur
before it gets worse.

57:05.738 --> 57:09.238
You wouldn't want her
to get worse, would you?

57:13.071 --> 57:15.738
So, what's it going to be?

57:31.205 --> 57:32.371
Hang in there, Egg.

57:38.638 --> 57:41.705
Bunniguru, what happened down there?

57:44.705 --> 57:45.838
Bunni?

57:51.571 --> 57:53.238
Are these your friends?

57:53.305 --> 57:54.738
Friends?

57:55.405 --> 57:57.005
Yes.

57:57.071 --> 57:59.338
We're real good friends now.

57:59.471 --> 58:01.271
Aren't we, rabbit?

58:03.138 --> 58:04.571
Get me the merchandise.

58:05.971 --> 58:07.705
Bunniguru, what's happening?

58:14.905 --> 58:17.138
Come here, little girl!

58:22.905 --> 58:24.305
Let me go!

58:24.638 --> 58:25.805
Egg!

58:33.838 --> 58:35.138
Egg!

58:41.371 --> 58:43.071
Chihoohoo, wait!

58:43.138 --> 58:44.305
The reward?

58:45.371 --> 58:48.871
I reckon she's just about worth
what you owe me.

58:49.338 --> 58:50.771
No, you can't!

58:51.271 --> 58:53.438
We need that money to fix Egg!

58:54.071 --> 58:55.871
Wait, no, stop, please!

58:56.305 --> 58:58.138
Chihoohoo, come back!

58:58.605 --> 59:01.638
Chihoohoo!

59:01.705 --> 59:03.238
Come back!

59:06.471 --> 59:07.805
What have I done?

59:17.905 --> 59:22.338
Keeper, I've got
a very special surprise for you.

59:22.971 --> 59:25.338
I don't need any more Squigglers.

59:25.538 --> 59:28.571
Do you really think
I'd bring you a little Squiggler

59:28.638 --> 59:30.205
after the haul I just brought in?

59:30.671 --> 59:33.505
Trust me, you are going to want this.

59:35.738 --> 59:37.371
You showed her, boss!

59:39.038 --> 59:40.405
Somebody!

59:43.505 --> 59:44.605
Let me out!

59:45.105 --> 59:46.505
Let me out!

01:00:03.171 --> 01:00:04.905
Doctor Maybee?

01:00:07.305 --> 01:00:09.738
Conforming new energy source.

01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:12.738
Optimum energy levels reached.

01:00:12.838 --> 01:00:14.405
It's working!

01:00:14.838 --> 01:00:18.405
You could run this machine
for fifty years

01:00:18.471 --> 01:00:20.605
and never come up with her DNA.

01:00:20.671 --> 01:00:22.805
You're draining the sun for nothing!

01:00:22.871 --> 01:00:24.338
It's not for nothing,

01:00:24.405 --> 01:00:26.638
she's the most important thing
in the world!

01:00:27.505 --> 01:00:29.838
You have no idea what it's been like.

01:00:29.905 --> 01:00:31.871
Your daughter is gone.

01:00:32.505 --> 01:00:34.305
You took her from me.

01:00:34.371 --> 01:00:36.405
What happened to her wasn't my fault!

01:00:36.705 --> 01:00:37.805
It was an accident!

01:00:37.871 --> 01:00:40.438
If you hadn't fought me
it never would have happened!

01:00:40.505 --> 01:00:42.005
You attacked me!

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.171
Your recklessness killed her.

01:00:44.238 --> 01:00:48.005
What kind of father acts like that
when he has a child to care for?

01:00:48.071 --> 01:00:51.171
Well, you could never understand
what it takes to be a real father.

01:00:51.238 --> 01:00:53.471
You're far too selfish.

01:00:53.538 --> 01:00:57.005
I've been a more loving father to her
than you ever could have been.

01:00:57.771 --> 01:00:58.805
What?

01:01:00.538 --> 01:01:02.238
Incoming transmission.

01:01:02.438 --> 01:01:04.438
- Doctor Maybee.
- What?

01:01:04.505 --> 01:01:05.638
Look!

01:01:12.705 --> 01:01:13.871
Arkie!

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:15.605
It can't be.

01:01:16.238 --> 01:01:17.371
No!

01:01:17.438 --> 01:01:19.338
Wait for me at the landing dock.

01:01:19.405 --> 01:01:22.705
Be sure nothing happens to her,
do you understand?

01:01:26.338 --> 01:01:27.405
No!

01:01:28.805 --> 01:01:32.738
Blister, all these years you had her.

01:01:32.805 --> 01:01:34.605
What are you going to do with her?

01:01:37.271 --> 01:01:38.771
Maybee, no!

01:01:39.105 --> 01:01:41.971
Please, leave her alone!

01:02:24.438 --> 01:02:25.938
It's really you!

01:02:26.038 --> 01:02:27.705
Doctor Maybee?

01:02:28.805 --> 01:02:30.838
What am I doing here?

01:02:31.505 --> 01:02:32.605
It's alright.

01:02:33.038 --> 01:02:34.638
You don't need to be scared.

01:02:35.338 --> 01:02:37.605
I believe you are looking
for your father.

01:02:38.205 --> 01:02:40.871
But my dad is here?

01:02:42.638 --> 01:02:44.671
Come. I'll take you to him.

01:02:46.338 --> 01:02:48.805
But there's something
I need to show you first.

01:03:16.671 --> 01:03:20.205
This is my gallery of memories.

01:03:21.038 --> 01:03:24.805
Moments from my past preserved forever.

01:03:26.271 --> 01:03:29.338
I used to spend a lot of time in here
trying to figure out

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:30.871
how to get my daughter back.

01:03:31.271 --> 01:03:32.871
You had a daughter?

01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:34.738
I did.

01:03:38.305 --> 01:03:40.938
Why does she look so much like me?

01:03:41.471 --> 01:03:45.305
Well, in a way, she is you.

01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:47.871
Arkie,

01:03:47.938 --> 01:03:49.871
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

01:03:49.938 --> 01:03:53.305
but Blister hasn't been honest with you

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:55.838
about something truly important.

01:03:56.238 --> 01:03:58.071
He's not your father.

01:03:59.571 --> 01:04:01.071
I am.

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:03.138
Wait.

01:04:03.538 --> 01:04:05.038
What do you mean?

01:04:06.038 --> 01:04:09.371
Many years ago
my daughter and I were forced

01:04:09.438 --> 01:04:12.238
to flee our home as our world
was destroyed.

01:04:15.271 --> 01:04:17.438
We were the only humans left
in the galaxy.

01:04:21.238 --> 01:04:24.538
Fearing for humanity's survival
I headed to a planet

01:04:24.605 --> 01:04:26.671
I'd heard incredible stories about.

01:04:27.271 --> 01:04:28.338
This planet.

01:04:29.305 --> 01:04:33.271
Legend told of an octopus
with regenerative properties

01:04:33.338 --> 01:04:34.971
named Blister.

01:04:38.838 --> 01:04:40.238
I knew if I could find him,

01:04:41.105 --> 01:04:44.271
he would be able to help me
bring back the human race.

01:04:46.671 --> 01:04:48.571
But when I finally found him...

01:04:50.271 --> 01:04:51.338
He attacked us!

01:04:51.871 --> 01:04:54.171
Killing my daughter, my Arkie.

01:04:56.471 --> 01:04:57.805
No!

01:05:04.705 --> 01:05:08.638
The only way of getting back my daughter
was to gather as much of her DNA

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:11.171
as I could and try to recreate her.

01:05:17.805 --> 01:05:20.371
And by harnessing the power of the sun

01:05:21.671 --> 01:05:22.738
I did it.

01:05:34.171 --> 01:05:37.038
I created you.

01:05:39.471 --> 01:05:42.405
But then,
before I had a chance to perfect you,

01:05:44.038 --> 01:05:45.905
fate took you from me again.

01:05:50.105 --> 01:05:52.571
Blister never told me
that he'd found you.

01:05:53.005 --> 01:05:54.971
I didn't even think
you were still alive!

01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:01.171
Until now.

01:06:02.705 --> 01:06:05.538
Why wouldn't dad tell me any of this?

01:06:05.605 --> 01:06:08.171
It doesn't make any sense! I can't be...

01:06:08.238 --> 01:06:09.805
You are human, Arkie.

01:06:09.938 --> 01:06:12.105
And you belong here.

01:06:12.238 --> 01:06:13.871
But my tentacle...

01:06:13.938 --> 01:06:16.971
I'm afraid my technology
wasn't as good as it is today

01:06:17.638 --> 01:06:20.371
and it malfunctioned.

01:06:20.438 --> 01:06:21.871
Where is my dad?

01:06:22.305 --> 01:06:23.638
I need to talk to him.

01:06:24.138 --> 01:06:26.438
I'll take you to my lab and show you.

01:06:28.905 --> 01:06:30.905
Subject vitals low.

01:06:44.238 --> 01:06:45.571
What is all this?

01:06:46.105 --> 01:06:50.171
This is where I run my experiments
and fix the citizens.

01:06:50.771 --> 01:06:53.505
Wait. My dad's here?

01:06:53.905 --> 01:06:55.138
He'll be up in a minute.

01:06:55.405 --> 01:06:57.605
But I think we should fix you up first.

01:06:58.105 --> 01:06:59.238
Don't you think?

01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:02.638
Fix me? How?

01:07:03.871 --> 01:07:06.371
Are you going to make
my tentacle heal things?

01:07:09.338 --> 01:07:10.938
No, don't be ridiculous.

01:07:11.005 --> 01:07:13.171
I'm not going to let you
keep that thing.

01:07:13.805 --> 01:07:16.071
I'm going to make you flawless.

01:07:17.005 --> 01:07:19.338
- You want to change me?
- Of course!

01:07:19.871 --> 01:07:21.938
You saw what my daughter looked like.

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.338
You're nowhere near
as perfect as she was.

01:07:25.105 --> 01:07:28.638
- Not yet.
- I can't just get rid of my tentacle.

01:07:29.005 --> 01:07:30.805
You don't have a choice.

01:07:33.171 --> 01:07:35.005
No! I don't want to!

01:07:35.771 --> 01:07:36.805
Dad?

01:07:37.305 --> 01:07:38.638
- Dad!
- Maybee.

01:07:38.705 --> 01:07:42.538
When are you going to understand
that he's not your father?

01:07:42.605 --> 01:07:45.905
We have to get rid of every mutation
he's responsible for.

01:07:45.971 --> 01:07:47.905
You have to be perfect!

01:07:47.971 --> 01:07:49.838
I want to talk to my dad.

01:07:50.405 --> 01:07:51.905
Where is he?

01:07:53.505 --> 01:07:55.138
You want to see him? Fine.

01:08:05.438 --> 01:08:06.905
Dad!

01:08:08.738 --> 01:08:10.138
Let him out!

01:08:10.538 --> 01:08:12.538
Enough of this. Keeper!

01:08:12.605 --> 01:08:14.338
Put her in the machine.

01:08:14.405 --> 01:08:15.871
Please, I don't want to change.

01:08:17.138 --> 01:08:20.038
Dad! Dad, wake up!

01:08:20.105 --> 01:08:21.205
Dad!

01:08:21.271 --> 01:08:22.371
Arkie?

01:08:22.438 --> 01:08:24.371
Get her inside the pod!

01:08:25.405 --> 01:08:26.971
Don't let him do this!

01:08:32.138 --> 01:08:33.305
No.

01:08:35.005 --> 01:08:36.738
What did you say to me?

01:08:37.205 --> 01:08:38.871
I'm not helping you harm her.

01:08:39.438 --> 01:08:42.205
I'm not helping you harm anyone anymore.

01:08:42.638 --> 01:08:46.705
Think very carefully
about what you're doing right now.

01:08:47.071 --> 01:08:48.405
Cover your eyes!

01:08:55.671 --> 01:08:58.205
Run, Arkie! Run!

01:08:58.271 --> 01:08:59.338
Dad!

01:08:59.405 --> 01:09:00.805
Keeper!

01:09:03.871 --> 01:09:05.571
Let me go!

01:09:05.671 --> 01:09:07.371
I have to go back for him!

01:09:07.438 --> 01:09:08.471
Listen to me.

01:09:08.538 --> 01:09:10.871
Maybee would have stopped at nothing
to transform you

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:12.271
and drained Blister to do it.

01:09:12.338 --> 01:09:14.405
We have to get you away from here.

01:09:14.471 --> 01:09:16.605
So quickly, follow me!

01:09:34.405 --> 01:09:36.138
Welcome to the Bower.

01:10:02.505 --> 01:10:03.871
Why are you helping me?

01:10:04.805 --> 01:10:06.971
You shouldn't have to change for Maybee.

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:10.438
No one should.

01:10:16.638 --> 01:10:18.238
Are you...

01:10:19.171 --> 01:10:20.205
Part Squiggler.

01:10:21.038 --> 01:10:23.405
I was one
of Dr. Maybee's early experiments.

01:10:23.838 --> 01:10:26.138
I wanted to help him create life.

01:10:26.205 --> 01:10:28.605
I thought his technology
was groundbreaking.

01:10:29.405 --> 01:10:32.838
But then I realized what we were doing
to the Squigglers was cruel.

01:10:33.738 --> 01:10:35.238
Why didn't you leave?

01:10:35.305 --> 01:10:38.605
It would have meant leaving them
helpless and hunted by Maybee.

01:10:38.671 --> 01:10:42.271
So I started hiding them down here
and helping them regain their strength.

01:10:45.805 --> 01:10:48.938
How could Dr. Maybee think
it was okay to hurt them?

01:10:49.338 --> 01:10:52.705
Doctor Maybee is prepared to do anything
to create his perfect daughter.

01:10:53.271 --> 01:10:55.605
He doesn't care about the planet
or the citizens.

01:10:57.471 --> 01:10:59.438
Or me. Right?

01:11:00.905 --> 01:11:01.938
No.

01:11:02.671 --> 01:11:05.338
He's become so consumed
by his need for perfection

01:11:05.405 --> 01:11:08.171
I don't think he's capable
of loving anyone anymore.

01:11:10.338 --> 01:11:12.405
Now my dad is stuck up there with him.

01:11:14.605 --> 01:11:15.838
What can we do?

01:11:25.171 --> 01:11:27.771
Warning. Sun core unstable.

01:11:27.838 --> 01:11:32.005
Maybee, stop this pointless destruction.

01:11:32.505 --> 01:11:35.705
Can't you see that you are never
going to get your daughter back?

01:11:36.371 --> 01:11:37.805
She's gone!

01:11:41.138 --> 01:11:43.738
Actually, you old octopus,

01:11:44.305 --> 01:11:46.171
thanks to you and your Arkie,

01:11:46.971 --> 01:11:49.738
I'm closer to getting her back
than I ever was before.

01:12:04.338 --> 01:12:06.505
Analyzing organic matter.

01:12:06.805 --> 01:12:09.005
Arkie DNA found.

01:12:09.071 --> 01:12:10.605
This is madness!

01:12:10.671 --> 01:12:12.405
The sun won't be able to take it!

01:12:12.471 --> 01:12:13.671
You'll kill us all!

01:12:13.738 --> 01:12:16.071
Wouldn't you do the same thing for Arkie

01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:18.338
if it was the only way?

01:12:28.371 --> 01:12:30.971
Final genome trials ready for launch.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:57.338
Where's that noise coming from?

01:12:57.405 --> 01:12:59.305
Maybee must have activated the beam.

01:12:59.405 --> 01:13:00.738
Dad!

01:13:00.805 --> 01:13:02.771
We have to go back and help him!

01:13:02.838 --> 01:13:05.571
We will but it's not safe
to leave the Bower.

01:13:05.638 --> 01:13:08.005
We have to wait
for the machine to stop first.

01:13:11.305 --> 01:13:12.471
Arkie?

01:13:19.205 --> 01:13:20.971
What have I done?

01:13:21.371 --> 01:13:23.971
We sold Arkie out for nothing!

01:13:26.238 --> 01:13:28.505
Perhaps the oracle has something to say.

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:34.005
"Be wary of the weatherman
who refuses to look up".

01:13:36.938 --> 01:13:38.971
What a bunch of nonsense!

01:13:40.338 --> 01:13:43.438
How are we going
to get out of this mess?

01:13:47.405 --> 01:13:49.871
Just let me wallow in peace, Egg.

01:14:00.738 --> 01:14:02.371
Sun core unstable.

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:05.471
Genome reconstruction requires
additional power.

01:14:06.871 --> 01:14:08.638
It's taking too long.

01:14:12.071 --> 01:14:16.005
Solar power increased.
Resuming life form reconstruction.

01:14:16.071 --> 01:14:17.371
Doctor Maybee!

01:14:20.471 --> 01:14:23.005
Well, this is a surprise.

01:14:27.471 --> 01:14:29.405
You need to stop this!

01:14:29.471 --> 01:14:31.705
If you promise to let Blister go,

01:14:31.971 --> 01:14:34.205
you can change me however you want.

01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:38.171
Well, after your little outburst
I realized

01:14:38.238 --> 01:14:41.538
that even if I were to fix you
you'd still be nothing

01:14:41.605 --> 01:14:43.871
like my beautiful little girl.

01:14:44.371 --> 01:14:48.371
But with your DNA
I can recreate her from scratch

01:14:48.438 --> 01:14:50.038
exactly how she should be.

01:14:50.838 --> 01:14:52.771
You have nothing left to offer me.

01:14:53.505 --> 01:14:56.805
Whatever you create in there
it still won't be

01:14:56.871 --> 01:14:58.271
the daughter you remember.

01:14:58.338 --> 01:15:00.871
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:15:00.938 --> 01:15:02.438
She was unique!

01:15:02.938 --> 01:15:05.371
There was more to her
than just how she looked.

01:15:05.871 --> 01:15:10.005
And what you're doing
is hurting my dad and killing the sun.

01:15:10.638 --> 01:15:13.438
She's the only thing that matters.

01:15:13.505 --> 01:15:14.938
Please!

01:15:15.538 --> 01:15:17.171
I can't lose him.

01:15:46.905 --> 01:15:50.505
I think we missed the landing bay
by just a smidge.

01:15:51.438 --> 01:15:52.738
Bunni?

01:15:52.838 --> 01:15:53.905
Egg!

01:15:53.971 --> 01:15:55.938
Quick! Give me a hand.

01:16:05.638 --> 01:16:07.071
Kid, let us help.

01:16:08.805 --> 01:16:09.938
Dad?

01:16:12.505 --> 01:16:14.538
- Dad!
- Arkie!

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.605
I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you the truth.

01:16:19.071 --> 01:16:21.171
Dad, it's okay.

01:16:21.471 --> 01:16:23.271
I'm just glad you're alright.

01:16:32.538 --> 01:16:35.138
Life form reconstruction failed.

01:16:35.738 --> 01:16:38.238
Life form reconstruction failed.

01:16:38.871 --> 01:16:41.305
Life form reconstruction failed.

01:16:45.871 --> 01:16:47.671
Crystal re-engaged.

01:16:47.738 --> 01:16:50.005
Sun core meltdown imminent.

01:16:50.071 --> 01:16:54.838
Blister, why do you always take
everything from me?

01:16:57.505 --> 01:16:58.605
No!

01:16:58.671 --> 01:17:01.505
Warning. System critical failure.

01:17:05.938 --> 01:17:07.705
Now we're even.

01:17:10.338 --> 01:17:12.771
- Maybee!
- Dad, wait!

01:17:12.838 --> 01:17:15.171
But he'll get away. We have to stop him.

01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:16.838
No, we don't.

01:17:16.905 --> 01:17:19.371
We have to stop the beam
from destroying the sun.

01:17:21.905 --> 01:17:23.171
But, how?

01:17:23.871 --> 01:17:26.005
Warning, crystal overload.

01:17:26.071 --> 01:17:27.971
Evacuate.

01:17:28.805 --> 01:17:30.371
Warning, crystal overload.

01:17:30.438 --> 01:17:32.305
Okay, follow me.

01:17:53.805 --> 01:17:54.838
Maybee!

01:17:57.171 --> 01:18:00.371
You don't get to destroy this world
and simply run away.

01:18:03.271 --> 01:18:04.838
Goodbye, Keeper.

01:18:19.571 --> 01:18:20.638
Wait.

01:18:24.005 --> 01:18:25.138
Stay back.

01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:26.571
Get away from me!

01:18:26.638 --> 01:18:29.438
You have to answer
for everything you've done.

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:31.871
especially to them.

01:18:43.205 --> 01:18:44.505
No!

01:18:58.305 --> 01:18:59.438
No!

01:18:59.838 --> 01:19:01.305
What have you done?

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:04.405
Emergency procedure initiated.

01:19:05.438 --> 01:19:06.638
No!

01:19:21.805 --> 01:19:23.971
Alright, what are you thinking, kiddo?

01:19:24.038 --> 01:19:27.605
- I have a plan but I need your help.
- What can we do?

01:19:31.771 --> 01:19:34.405
Okay, everyone get to a mirror.

01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:37.771
When I give the signal,
aim at the crystal.

01:19:41.305 --> 01:19:43.205
I need you to throw me to the center.

01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:47.905
- Arkie, I can't just throw you.
- Dad, I know what I'm doing.

01:19:48.471 --> 01:19:49.838
Trust me.

01:19:51.138 --> 01:19:52.705
Go get them, kiddo.

01:20:08.138 --> 01:20:09.705
Glad I stuck that landing.

01:20:22.771 --> 01:20:25.571
Nothing to it but to do it.

01:20:37.071 --> 01:20:38.071
Now!

01:20:50.438 --> 01:20:52.538
Keep holding!

01:20:52.605 --> 01:20:54.671
That's it!

01:21:20.305 --> 01:21:21.305
We're alive!

01:21:23.805 --> 01:21:24.805
Get off me!

01:21:24.871 --> 01:21:27.038
You're messing up my moustache!

01:21:30.705 --> 01:21:31.971
Arkie?

01:21:32.538 --> 01:21:33.605
Dad!

01:21:38.071 --> 01:21:39.805
That was amazing!

01:21:40.305 --> 01:21:42.038
I'm so proud of you.

01:21:42.705 --> 01:21:43.871
Thanks, Dad.

01:21:44.538 --> 01:21:45.605
Arkie!

01:21:47.938 --> 01:21:52.171
Dad, I'd like you to meet
two very special friends of mine.

01:21:52.605 --> 01:21:54.771
Bunniguru and Egg.

01:21:55.271 --> 01:21:56.971
Mister Blister.

01:21:57.605 --> 01:22:00.705
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise.

01:22:03.571 --> 01:22:05.605
That's a nasty crack you've got there.

01:22:07.238 --> 01:22:09.271
Dad, do you think...?

01:22:11.538 --> 01:22:13.771
Ready to see what an octopus
can really do?

01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:43.238
Egg!

01:22:48.071 --> 01:22:49.071
Wait.

01:22:50.638 --> 01:22:51.871
Here you go.

01:22:54.771 --> 01:22:56.638
Good as new.

01:23:01.771 --> 01:23:03.671
Thank you, Arkie.

01:23:35.738 --> 01:23:37.838
This is living, Egg.

01:23:39.038 --> 01:23:41.938
I wonder what the oracle
would say in this occasion.

01:23:46.471 --> 01:23:48.138
Why would you do that?

01:23:52.771 --> 01:23:53.771
You're right.

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:58.238
Sometimes it's best
to just enjoy the moment.

01:24:05.238 --> 01:24:08.305
Now, I think I've got this.

01:24:12.305 --> 01:24:13.638
Is this right?

01:24:14.405 --> 01:24:16.138
What are you doing?

01:24:16.205 --> 01:24:17.971
Why are you shaking it?

01:24:18.371 --> 01:24:22.038
- Stop, okay? Stop.
- Be nice to your old dad.

01:24:22.738 --> 01:24:25.505
Alright, what do I actually need to do?

01:24:26.138 --> 01:24:29.371
You just do your reviving thing
and I'll do the rest.

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:38.005
Here we go!

01:24:48.638 --> 01:24:51.705
So what machine should we build next?

01:24:52.171 --> 01:24:55.438
Well, there's always
something you can do.

01:24:56.071 --> 01:24:58.805
And I've got a few ideas.

01:27:28.805 --> 01:27:30.605
I hate it when you're right.
