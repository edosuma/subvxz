00:00.333 --> 00:03.535
Hawkeye:
In a world
where hungry beasts

00:03.537 --> 00:05.170
Lurk in the shadows,

00:05.372 --> 00:09.742
One man will risk everything
for the fate of his stomach.

00:10.610 --> 00:13.379
Rye, tomatoes,
pickles, beansprouts,

00:13.381 --> 00:16.315
Peanut butter, ham,
turkey, swiss, mustard.

00:17.717 --> 00:20.486
Ah, now before
hulk or thor
can catch a whiff...

00:22.088 --> 00:25.157
<i>Voila! </i> A sandwich assembled.

00:28.595 --> 00:31.597
Mmm. Ah, perfect sandwich.

00:31.599 --> 00:34.800
Jarvis:  <i>Sir, a dangerous</i>
<i>projectile has entered</i>
<i>earth's atmosphere.</i>

00:35.568 --> 00:38.070
Hey, jarvis?
Perfect sandwich.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.206
<i>Impressive.</i>
<i>Perhaps the sandwich</i>
<i>would like to save the city.</i>

00:42.742 --> 00:44.176
(moans)

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.190 --> 01:01.427
All right, projectile.
You got my attention.
Stinks to be you.

01:02.128 --> 01:04.563
Jarvis:  <i>Warning.</i>
<i>Target identified as friendly.</i>

01:04.565 --> 01:06.832
Uh, check
your dictionary app, jarv.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.168
Great balls of fire
are not friendly.

01:11.805 --> 01:15.741
(sirens blaring)
oh, changing the play
from shoot to catch.

01:17.811 --> 01:21.647
<i>Sir, I would not recommend</i>
<i>this particular</i>
<i>course of action.</i>

01:21.781 --> 01:24.616
Don't worry, I can catch
as well as I can shoot.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.153
(siren beeping)

01:33.726 --> 01:35.094
Ugh!

01:44.471 --> 01:47.773
That's what I do.
Perfect sandwich,
perfect landing.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.677
Tony will pay for that.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.412
(groaning)

01:54.781 --> 01:57.416
So are you going to say
thank you, or just lie there
looking green, hulk?

01:57.418 --> 02:00.252
(groans)
hulk? What?

02:00.820 --> 02:02.254
Who hulk?

02:03.590 --> 02:06.191
Uh, eight feet tall,
attitude problem,
has a thing for smashing.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.160
Huh?

02:08.895 --> 02:10.729
Wait, are you serious?

02:10.731 --> 02:14.133
Can't remember
anything except...

02:14.501 --> 02:16.235
World's gonna end.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.270
Whoa!
(crashes)

02:19.739 --> 02:22.274
Perfect. (coughs)

02:33.786 --> 02:37.422
I'm no expert,
but it looks like he took
a serious shot to the head.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.525
Hence the amnesia
and the bruising.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.794
And what's strong enough
to smack the hulk
across the sky like that?

02:42.796 --> 02:44.863
Nothing.
Which is a very scary thought.

02:45.765 --> 02:49.301
Being covered in hulk,
that's a very scary thought.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.502
(sniffs)

02:50.504 --> 02:51.837
Does stark own
an air-freshener factory?

02:51.839 --> 02:54.506
<i>No, but I'll build you</i>
<i>one for each armpit.</i>

02:54.874 --> 02:56.475
<i>How's the patient?</i>

02:56.477 --> 02:59.244
A ghost!
(crashing)

02:59.379 --> 03:00.812
What's your name?

03:02.282 --> 03:03.749
<i>Okay, then.</i>

03:03.751 --> 03:05.517
Where are you?
This is important.

03:05.785 --> 03:08.420
I know, that's why
we're holo-chatting...

03:08.422 --> 03:11.190
While I save
a japanese oil-tanker
from sinking.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.829
What do we know?
<i>Hulk has retrograde amnesia.</i>

03:17.831 --> 03:19.331
<i>Doesn't even sound</i>
<i>like the hulk.</i>

03:19.333 --> 03:20.832
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>he seems sure of is...</i>

03:20.834 --> 03:25.370
If I had a dollar
for every time
I heard that one,

03:25.505 --> 03:27.472
I'd be even richer.

03:37.517 --> 03:38.917
<i>Now about that storm,</i>

03:38.919 --> 03:42.754
<i>It's unlike anything</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>
<i>(grunts)</i>

03:42.756 --> 03:44.790
Need backup?
<i>Not yet.</i>

03:44.924 --> 03:48.594
<i>I'll play storm chaser</i>
<i>while you guys try</i>
<i>and jog hulk's memory.</i>

03:48.761 --> 03:51.330
<i>Try his room.</i>
<i>It couldn't hurt, right?</i>

03:53.866 --> 03:56.301
He really keeps
the place clean, doesn't he?

03:56.303 --> 03:57.970
And so purdy.

03:57.972 --> 04:01.940
Not that there's
anything wrong
with clean and purdy.

04:01.942 --> 04:02.908
Whoa!

04:04.544 --> 04:05.811
Remember anything yet,
big fella?

04:06.980 --> 04:10.249
Maybe. Bird-face is new,

04:10.251 --> 04:11.950
Joke-man not funny,

04:12.418 --> 04:14.987
Flag-man name is...
Flag-man?

04:15.622 --> 04:17.956
Progress...
Except I'm hilarious.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.959
This isn't working.
We need to retrace
hulk's steps.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.928
Figure out where he was.
What hit him.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.796
Do any of you know
what he does with his day?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.965
You mean besides smashing?
Nope.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.800
(groaning)

04:30.703 --> 04:32.604
I didn't scan
any internal injuries.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.673
Maybe it's gamma-gas?

04:34.675 --> 04:37.042
Oh, please be wrong.
Be so wrong.

04:37.644 --> 04:38.710
Hey.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.714
It's a receipt for...
(chuckles) oh, man.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.916
You are not going to believe
where it's from.

04:53.993 --> 04:57.562
I'm the hulk, right?
Why is that a surprise?

04:57.830 --> 05:01.466
Your temper doesn't always mix
with competitive sports.

05:01.635 --> 05:07.973
You got some nerve
showing your mug here,
you big, green, dope.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.976
This is the end of the world!

05:14.347 --> 05:15.881
(grunts)

05:19.419 --> 05:20.819
The thing?
The thing.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.855
Fighting the hulk?
Yeah, it's as bad
as you think.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.524
(growling)

05:32.398 --> 05:37.469
Don't hit me, rock-face.
I have a head injury,
and maybe a temper!

05:37.603 --> 05:40.605
Temper?
You want to see a temper?

05:40.907 --> 05:42.407
(growls)

05:45.812 --> 05:47.713
(both yelling)

05:48.014 --> 05:50.649
Enough! We don't have
time for this, ben.

05:50.784 --> 05:55.587
Yeah, we'll give me
a second and
I'll pound it back into him.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.823
He said
the world's in danger.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.758
We need to know
what happened here.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.960
(grunts) okay.

06:02.495 --> 06:07.032
Hulk and me was gonna roll
a nice civilized game,
like every week.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.067
You guys
are bowling buddies?

06:09.069 --> 06:11.870
Not anymore.
I mean, look at this place!

06:11.872 --> 06:15.941
Do you know
how hard it is finding
size 47 bowling shoes?

06:15.943 --> 06:18.944
Huh?
Yancy street lanes was it!

06:19.078 --> 06:22.647
Which is weirder?
That the hulk bowls,
or that he wears shoes?

06:22.649 --> 06:25.050
So we was having
a nice time, right?

06:25.952 --> 06:28.019
<i>But then hulk</i>
<i>accused me of cheating.</i>

06:28.021 --> 06:32.791
(buzzer sounding)
for the record,
I never stepped over the line.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.061
<i>Things kind of</i>
<i>developed from there.</i>

06:36.596 --> 06:41.032
<i>Insults were exchanged,</i>
<i>punches were thrown.</i>
<i>You know, the usual.</i>

06:41.167 --> 06:42.768
<i>Totally civilized.</i>

06:42.770 --> 06:46.605
<i>Until this yahoo</i>
<i>busts a gas main</i>

06:46.607 --> 06:49.975
<i>Without so much as a</i>
<i>"sorry I busted</i>
<i>your gas main."</i>

06:51.878 --> 06:54.045
I mean, it's like
the end of the world, here.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.181
What am I gonna do
on Wednesday nights?

06:56.749 --> 06:59.184
The end of the world.
Tony can make this right.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.685
Right?

07:00.687 --> 07:02.587
(beeping)

07:02.955 --> 07:04.556
<i>It's crisis time, guys.</i>

07:04.558 --> 07:06.558
<i>This storm's even worse</i>
<i>than I thought.</i>

07:06.826 --> 07:09.961
I'm reading worldwide
seismic activity,
tidal shifts.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.731
Very big, very bad stuff.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.966
Hulk may have been
onto something.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.969
<i>Figure out what</i>
<i>he was talking about asap.</i>

07:18.438 --> 07:21.473
This is one of those
times I really wish
I knew the hulk better.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.109
No kidding.
He must have been
somewhere important today.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.045
So, what,
you clobbered the hulk
and gave him that bruise?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.915
I wish.
I didn't get a chance.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.818
He took off with his
red and blue pajama pal,
webhead,

07:32.820 --> 07:33.919
Just before
the place went up.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.488
What's a webhead?

07:37.557 --> 07:39.024
Spider-man: Hot dog!

07:39.026 --> 07:41.226
Get your friendly,
neighborhood hot dogs.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.161
No charge for extra webbing.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.767
The avengers? Yes!

07:49.602 --> 07:53.004
This is so
the end of the world.
I'm guessing it's so not.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.674
Dude, I have
this spanish final
I have to study for and...

07:55.676 --> 07:58.610
I... I mean,
s.H.I.E.L.D. Field tactical
test thing...

07:58.744 --> 08:00.712
In     <i>espanol.</i>
<i>So can you take over?</i>

08:01.581 --> 08:02.781
Take over what?

08:02.949 --> 08:04.583
Paying for the hulk's lunch.

08:04.717 --> 08:05.951
(stomach grumbles)

08:05.953 --> 08:08.119
(farts) oh, excuse me.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.256
He didn't tell you?
I just got my allowance,
uh, s.H.I.E.L.D. Pay.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.892
And I heard a ruckus
on yancy street.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.028
<i>Turns out to be</i>
<i>my green pal looking blue,</i>
<i>so I ask for the deets.</i>

08:17.697 --> 08:19.998
<i>He was pretty mad.</i>
<i>Something about cheating</i>
<i>and smashing.</i>

08:20.233 --> 08:21.967
<i>So I invite him</i>
<i>to talk it out</i>

08:24.237 --> 08:27.772
Well, apparently
when the hulk sulks,
he eats meats.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.508
(chuckles) rhymes.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.742
Spidey, please.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.144
He ate, like,
every hot dog in midtown.

08:33.947 --> 08:37.716
So here I am, your friendly,
neighborhood, spider-man

08:37.717 --> 08:39.784
Trying to make good,
when I should be practicing,

08:39.785 --> 08:41.886
<i>"donde esta la biblioteca?"</i>

08:41.889 --> 08:43.522
For... S.H.I.E.L.D.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.890
Webhead is funny.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.259
So, that's it? No battle?

08:47.261 --> 08:49.528
Nothing end-of-the-worldy
happened?

08:49.762 --> 08:52.998
No, it was all
hot dogs and rainbows.
Literally.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.634
You didn't catch the rainbow
when you flew in?

08:55.768 --> 08:57.903
Falcon: No. No, we did not.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.204
Rainbow!

08:59.206 --> 09:00.839
(grunts)

09:02.608 --> 09:04.709
Oh, that's what he did
the last time!

09:04.877 --> 09:06.945
Come back here
and sell these wieners!

09:06.947 --> 09:09.814
Follow him!
But... (stammers) hot dogs!

09:09.982 --> 09:11.683
<i>Perro caliente?</i>

09:11.685 --> 09:12.951
(sighs)

09:15.288 --> 09:17.889
Readings indicate
it's a portal of some kind.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.057
Then take us in.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.261
(sirens beeping)
this might
have been a bad idea.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.166
(all shouting)

09:34.206 --> 09:37.309
Gotta pull up,
or the world's gonna end
sooner than we think.

09:37.944 --> 09:40.245
I hate this day so much!

09:44.984 --> 09:46.885
(grunting)

09:52.858 --> 09:55.260
Hulk is strong.
You're welcome!

09:57.330 --> 09:58.897
(grunting)

09:59.131 --> 10:01.066
We gonna
tell tony about this?

10:01.334 --> 10:02.667
No, we are not.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.743
It looks like candy!

10:13.112 --> 10:14.646
Oh.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.314
Have you ever seen
this side of the hulk?

10:16.716 --> 10:20.952
No. And I'm not sure
if it's adorable
or really disturbing.

10:21.187 --> 10:23.822
Maybe an explosive arrow
will knock his memory back.

10:23.824 --> 10:24.990
Not here!

10:24.992 --> 10:26.891
Okay. Just a joke.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.327
Funny man, remember?
What is this place?

10:29.329 --> 10:31.029
Man: Hail, friend hulk.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.931
Back so soon?

10:36.135 --> 10:38.870
The '70s called.
They want
their suntan back.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.939
Stow it, hawkeye.
His name's glorian.

10:40.941 --> 10:44.075
A very respected,
very powerful,
inter-dimensional craftsman.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.111
There's a file on him
at avengers tower.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.013
You guys
don't read the files?

10:48.015 --> 10:49.848
We gotta
get you a hobby, cap.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.050
Reading files is my hobby.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.753
Welcome to my humble home,
mighty avengers.

10:54.887 --> 10:57.255
I am the galaxy's
greatest builder.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.024
He, its greatest smasher.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.226
We appreciate
each other's talents.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.395
Why, he was just here
earlier today,

11:03.397 --> 11:06.064
Regaling me
with tales of smashing.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.266
You seem perplexed.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.136
He did confide
that some of you
are simple-minded.

11:11.138 --> 11:15.106
Glorian, sorry to rush this,
but hulk lost his memory

11:15.108 --> 11:16.975
Sometime after he was here.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.944
We think he discovered
something dangerous
after he left you.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.846
How could he forget all this?

11:22.048 --> 11:25.183
Hulk, you came here
for the new statuette
I promised.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.119
The glass figurines
in his room.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.954
Long way to go
for a collection.

11:29.956 --> 11:33.224
Hulk was admiring the piece
when your viking
comrade arrived.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.026
Wait, thor was here?

11:35.194 --> 11:36.928
Bit of a barbarian.

11:36.930 --> 11:40.231
Droned on about your efforts
to determine who is stronger.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.468
Hulk, this is important,
where is thor now?

11:44.003 --> 11:47.439
Ugh, I... I...
Ooh.
(stomach rumbling)

11:47.773 --> 11:49.374
I don't feel so good.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.911
After a thousand hot dogs,
I wonder why.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.979
(vomiting)

11:56.048 --> 11:59.951
Ew! All over the nice man's
crystal cabana?

11:59.953 --> 12:01.252
(vomits)

12:01.254 --> 12:02.787
(moaning)

12:02.789 --> 12:05.323
Falcon: Um, guys,
you should look at this.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.726
Hawkeye: No, we really,
really shouldn't.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.294
Falcon: That ain't no hot dog.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.930
(growling)

12:13.132 --> 12:14.466
Tell me I'm seeing this.

12:14.468 --> 12:17.068
We're in a disco neon
crystal rainbow palace

12:17.070 --> 12:19.003
Where the hulk's being
attacked by his own yack?

12:20.072 --> 12:22.941
Affirmative.
Just when you think
you know a guy.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.777
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go hurl.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.345
(grunting)
captain america:
It's growing.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.284
(grunts)

12:43.162 --> 12:46.030
Stop it!
Hulk not remember this place,

12:46.198 --> 12:48.366
But it's too pretty
to get smashed.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.768
Pretty?

12:50.836 --> 12:52.437
(grunting)

12:57.042 --> 12:59.811
(laughs)

13:04.283 --> 13:06.851
(panting)

13:08.053 --> 13:09.454
Sorry for the mess.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.790
All: Sorry?

13:11.792 --> 13:13.191
Worry not, friend hulk.

13:13.193 --> 13:17.195
It is an honor to have
my home smashed
by someone of your stature.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.264
You, sir, are a virtuoso.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.232
Iron man:  <i>Avengers,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

13:21.434 --> 13:26.204
Iron man,
we finally have a lead on
hulk's world-ending threat.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.973
I think...
Iron man:  <i>Look, meet me</i>
<i>at the tower. Now.</i>

13:29.241 --> 13:30.475
Bye, glowy-man.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.010
Until we next meet,
friend hulk.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.914
Truly a master of disaster.

13:39.885 --> 13:42.086
You have some
interesting friends, hulk.

13:42.088 --> 13:45.123
I bet I have a lot of friends
you don't know about.

13:45.891 --> 13:48.059
(grunts)
well, I'm not telling him.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.904
Hulk: I told you.
End of the world.

14:01.106 --> 14:04.042
I think I liked it better
when you just said,
"hulk smash."

14:05.544 --> 14:09.080
You guys have fun
joyriding through
alternate dimensions?

14:09.248 --> 14:11.049
We've been
reconstructing hulk's day

14:11.051 --> 14:12.917
To figure out
what beat
the snot out of him.

14:12.919 --> 14:15.019
Not this. I ate this.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.055
Just didn't stay ate.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.624
(whirring)

14:22.928 --> 14:24.429
Jarvis:  <i>Sir,</i>
<i>my scan of the creature</i>

14:24.431 --> 14:27.632
<i>Has detected</i>
<i>microscopic traces</i>
<i>of lunar dust.</i>

14:27.634 --> 14:31.269
Lunar? Jarvis,
3d the hulk's shiner.

14:31.904 --> 14:34.005
Now invert the impression.

14:37.643 --> 14:41.613
It isn't a bruise
from a fist.
It's from a hammer.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.314
Mjolnir.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.885
That's a funny word,
mjolnir.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.153
(laughs) mjolnir!

14:49.155 --> 14:54.058
So thor hit the hulk
hard enough
to give him amnesia?

14:54.226 --> 14:56.928
Well, if you're gonna
hit the hulk, you don't
want him to remember it.

14:56.930 --> 15:00.431
Here's what happened,
I was sniffing around
these seismic anomalies,

15:00.433 --> 15:03.101
<i>And guess who decided</i>
<i>it was playtime?</i>

15:03.103 --> 15:07.472
<i>Thor and the green guy were</i>
<i>arguing over who's stronger,</i>
<i>which never gets old,</i>

15:07.474 --> 15:10.041
<i>While I was trying to work.</i>
<i>(crashing)</i>

15:10.043 --> 15:12.944
<i>So I told them</i>
<i>to leave the tower</i>
<i>and fight somewhere else.</i>

15:12.946 --> 15:14.245
<i>Anywhere else.</i>

15:14.247 --> 15:19.083
"you two want to beat
each other to a pulp,
take it to the moon."

15:22.922 --> 15:25.056
(grunts)
I went to the moon?

15:25.058 --> 15:27.959
To wrestle a viking?
Cool!

15:27.961 --> 15:30.194
Don't say cool.
It sounds wrong.

15:30.329 --> 15:32.530
All of the seismic shifts
and upheavals

15:32.532 --> 15:34.699
Are consistent
with massive changes
in gravity

15:34.701 --> 15:36.067
Between the earth
and the moon.

15:36.402 --> 15:38.069
The moon...

15:38.203 --> 15:41.639
The moon.
(gasps)
the moon! Yes!

15:41.975 --> 15:46.277
Please say
there's something
to smash up there.

15:46.545 --> 15:49.013
Yeah. Big smash!

15:50.015 --> 15:51.549
(growling)

15:53.986 --> 15:56.988
Hulk? Where are you?

15:57.122 --> 15:59.157
(screeching)

16:07.566 --> 16:09.367
(people panicking)

16:09.369 --> 16:12.303
Floods, earthquakes, chaos...

16:12.305 --> 16:14.739
Should we really be leaving
at a time like this?

16:14.741 --> 16:17.408
If we don't, there won't be
an earth left to worry about.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.278
I've been in touch
with s.H.I.E.L.D.
They're on damage control

16:20.280 --> 16:21.679
Until we shut down
the problem.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.066
There. The blue area.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.268
Captain america:
Only sector of the moon
with breathable atmosphere,

16:44.270 --> 16:45.670
Thanks to the watcher.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.505
The who?
There's a file.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.407
I'm floating!
(laughs)

16:49.409 --> 16:51.142
Later. There's thor.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.044
(grunting)

16:53.046 --> 16:55.313
You do remember
how to smash, don't you?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.582
Some things you never forget.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.584
Avengers... Fight!

16:59.586 --> 17:00.952
Close enough.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.057
(growls)

17:07.659 --> 17:10.194
Targeting
giant spaghetti monster.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.067
Finally!
What were you people doing?

17:16.069 --> 17:17.667
Seeing of the sights?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.038
Do you have any idea
what this thing is?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.740
Thor: I know it
from ancient legend.
A badun-cylek.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.042
A mindless destroyer
of planets.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.246
If it consumes the moon...

17:28.248 --> 17:33.418
Iron man: It's a giant
parasite feeding off
whatever it's latched onto.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.353
In this case,
the moon's mass.

17:35.554 --> 17:39.123
If we don't stop it,
it'll completely tear
the moon apart.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.526
And the earth is next.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.462
Well, then let's make sure
it doesn't get that far.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.631
Hulk, you're gonna
have to finish
what you started.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.575
I don't remember,
but they say you hit me!

17:57.577 --> 18:00.178
Of course I did!
It was your idea.

18:00.345 --> 18:01.779
My idea?

18:04.616 --> 18:06.284
I tracked you down
in glorian's realm

18:06.286 --> 18:08.086
For our scheduled
sparring match.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.854
After returning
to avengers tower,

18:09.856 --> 18:13.458
Iron man suggested
we come to the moon
to continue our contest.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.428
Got all that.
New stuff, please.

18:17.563 --> 18:21.132
Ah, it was a mighty battle,
which I was winning,

18:21.834 --> 18:25.269
<i>But was interrupted</i>
<i>when we chanced</i>
<i>across badun-cylek.</i>

18:25.671 --> 18:27.638
<i>Your combat tactics</i>
<i>were valiant,</i>

18:27.773 --> 18:31.442
But I was certain that
your efforts to eat the beast
would come to naught.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.880
<i>With our comlinks damaged,</i>
<i>and no transportation,</i>
<i>you had a brilliant idea.</i>

18:36.648 --> 18:39.550
You won't be angry?
I'm always angry.

18:39.718 --> 18:41.552
I mean at me. For this.

18:41.554 --> 18:45.189
What's the matter?
Afraid to finally
take a shot, goldilocks?

18:46.359 --> 18:50.628
Thor:  <i>A mighty blow</i>
<i>from mjolnir sent</i>
<i>you back to earth.</i>

18:50.796 --> 18:53.197
<i>You were to return</i>
<i>with our teammates.</i>

18:53.866 --> 18:56.300
There's a sort of genius
about that plan.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.169
Except for the amnesia,

18:58.337 --> 18:59.904
And the parasite, and...

19:00.339 --> 19:01.506
That's mine!

19:07.546 --> 19:10.515
Yours?
There's plenty of monster
for everyone.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.623
(grunts)

19:23.695 --> 19:25.463
I'm okay. Aah!

19:25.898 --> 19:27.732
Prioritize much?

19:27.900 --> 19:29.433
(cooing)

19:36.241 --> 19:39.877
Don't... Don't smash!

19:39.879 --> 19:42.480
I don't think
you've ever
said that sentence.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.915
Perhaps I did
hit you too hard.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.620
Hulk: No!

19:52.524 --> 19:54.725
(growling)

20:13.879 --> 20:15.713
Should we help?

20:18.850 --> 20:21.485
I think he's
kind of got this.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.821
Iron man:
S.H.I.E.L.D. Transmissions
say the lunar effects

20:23.823 --> 20:26.290
Are starting
to die down on earth.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.994
Besides, you want
to get any of that on you?

20:29.996 --> 20:31.862
I know who I am!

20:32.231 --> 20:33.831
I'm the hulk!

20:45.777 --> 20:48.279
I'm the strongest there is!

20:48.513 --> 20:50.414
Debatable.
Iron man: Really?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.350
To be settled
at a later date.

20:53.285 --> 20:54.952
Iron man:
Bowling with the thing,

20:54.954 --> 20:56.587
Lunch with spider-man,

20:56.589 --> 20:58.456
And what's a glorian, again?

20:58.657 --> 21:01.726
Hawkeye: There's a file.
Ask cap, it's his hobby.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.762
(sighs)
weirdest day of my life.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.298
Maybe,
but we learned one thing,

21:07.566 --> 21:11.602
There's a lot more
to our big, green friend
than meets the eye.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.405
(roars)

21:27.052 --> 21:29.020
(laughs) yeah!

21:29.022 --> 21:30.955
(laughing)
yee-haw!

21:30.957 --> 21:32.023
Giddy up, stabby!
