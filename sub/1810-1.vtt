01:09.160 --> 01:11.639
Oh, Father, turn it up.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.559
Please, Mr. Dragomir,
I love this song.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.919
This song is sick... the traditional
"vomit" definition of the word.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.279
Shut up, Andre. Me and
Rose want to hear it.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.279
"Rose and I," Lissa, "Rose and I."

01:21.280 --> 01:23.847
I think the tune is rather catchy.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.370
Lissa?

01:34.400 --> 01:37.719
Lissa. Hey, Lissa, wake up.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.199
- You're having a bad dream.
- It wasn't a dream.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.079
I know. The accident.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.279
Sorry. Not again.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.719
You know, ever since that night,
I still can't get used to it.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.559
You being in my head,
it's so weird.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.719
You should know by now, with us,

01:52.720 --> 01:54.639
"weird" doesn't begin to cover it.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.959
Why can't you be like
a normal teenage girl

01:57.960 --> 02:00.719
and dream about hot,
naked guys on unicorns?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.679
Does it have to be unicorns?

02:02.680 --> 02:06.479
Of course not. It could be Jet
Skis, mechanical bulls or...

02:06.480 --> 02:09.999
Why do you have a scary poster
of an American ex-president?

02:10.000 --> 02:13.199
Well, you told me I needed to
blend more into Oregano society.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.719
We're in Oregon. You know
you're completely hopeless

02:15.720 --> 02:17.319
as a human being, right?

02:17.320 --> 02:18.919
I'm still adjusting, Rose.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.599
It's been less than a year since
we ran away from the academy,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.719
two years since the crash.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.239
Don't you ever stop to think about
everything that we've gone through?

02:26.240 --> 02:29.039
Stopping is for losers. I only
think about keeping us moving

02:29.040 --> 02:30.679
and keeping you safe.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.079
Does anyone even remember us?

02:32.080 --> 02:34.399
You really think the academy's
still trying to hunt us down?

02:34.400 --> 02:38.359
Absolutely. I think we may
have to get plastic surgery.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.479
No, don't, please.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.359
- Yes? No?
- No.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.239
- Just like this? You like it?
- Rose, no.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.959
- Whoa. When was the last time you...?
- I'm not hungry.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.319
Is exactly what you say
every time you're hungry.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.807
Come to the kitchen.
I'll make your favorite.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.079
Are you... are you sure about this?

03:02.080 --> 03:03.327
Bon appÃ©tit.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.805
- Thanks.
- What are friends for?

03:22.040 --> 03:23.959
You jealous, Oscar?

03:23.960 --> 03:26.003
What are you looking at?

03:27.800 --> 03:29.199
Do I still have anything on my...?

03:29.200 --> 03:30.759
Lissa, smile. They're watching.
Not a drill.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.407
- What's out there? Not Strigoi?
- No, not Strigoi, thank God. Guardians.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.084
Keep close, just like we practiced.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.604
Lissa, go.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.239
- Did you have to hurt them?
- Did I have to hurt them?

04:15.240 --> 04:17.238
You're welcome.
Get out the map, Gandhi.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.798
We'll head north into Canada.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.959
Did you really bring that fur ball?

04:21.959 --> 04:23.969
I couldn't just abandon him.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.519
Hells, yes.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.799
Rose.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.879
Princess Vasilisa Dragomir.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.799
My name is Dimitri Belikov.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.119
I've come to take you back
to St. Vladimir's Academy.

04:37.120 --> 04:41.723
Listen, comrade, to get to her,
you're gonna have to go through me.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.199
<i>Like I said, "weird"
doesn't begin to cover it.</i>

04:53.200 --> 04:55.519
<i>My best friend Lissa
Dragomir is a royal member</i>

04:55.520 --> 04:58.439
<i>of a magical, ancient
race: the Moroi.</i>

04:58.440 --> 05:02.559
<i>The Moroi don't wear black capes,
turn into bats or sleep in coffins.</i>

05:02.560 --> 05:06.319
<i>Daylight annoys yet doesn't kill them,
and they don't sparkle, either.</i>

05:06.320 --> 05:10.199
<i>But, yes, like most creatures with
fangs, the Moroi live off blood.</i>

05:10.200 --> 05:12.519
<i>But they don't live forever,
that's why they need us.</i>

05:13.760 --> 05:17.399
<i>My name is Rose Hathaway and like
these other guys, I'm a Dhampir.</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:19.959
<i>We're the protectors,
the guardians.</i>

05:19.960 --> 05:23.879
<i>Only half Moroi, I can eat a bacon
cheeseburger or whatever else I want.</i>

05:23.880 --> 05:26.279
<i>Dhampir lives are dedicated
to protecting the Moroi.</i>

05:26.280 --> 05:29.279
<i>We live by one simple
expression: they come first.</i>

05:29.280 --> 05:31.039
<i>Only nothing's ever simple.</i>

05:31.040 --> 05:35.679
Handcuffs? There's got to be a
compliment in there somewhere.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.079
So you're taking us
back to the academy.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.770
Tell me, how bad is it gonna be?

05:40.800 --> 05:41.959
Nothing?

05:41.960 --> 05:44.359
You know, I kept the
princess safe and hidden

05:44.360 --> 05:46.679
for an entire year
before you got lucky.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.679
- Congratulations.
- It speaks.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.399
Wow, that's a lot of <i>molnija</i>
marks you got there.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.959
You've killed six Strigoi?

05:53.960 --> 05:55.879
We were afraid that we'd run
into one of them back there.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.999
If you had run into a Strigoi, we
wouldn't be having this conversation.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.328
This is your idea
of a conversation?

06:04.680 --> 06:06.999
Exactly.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.005
We are here. Open the gate.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.119
Anyone there?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.406
Where is everyone?

06:45.040 --> 06:46.879
- Let's go!
- Lissa!

06:46.880 --> 06:48.159
Move, move!

06:51.800 --> 06:53.650
Stay in the car.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.487
No!

07:21.440 --> 07:24.007
I've got this one. Stay here.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.488
What's going on out there?

07:38.920 --> 07:40.690
Stay here.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.599
Spiridon.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.529
Welcome back, Dimitri.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.359
<i>And then there's group number three:
the bad vampires, the Strigoi.</i>

08:31.360 --> 08:33.639
<i>Evil bloodsuckers that
only come out at night</i>

08:33.640 --> 08:36.039
<i>and can only be killed
by a silver stake.</i>

08:36.039 --> 08:39.919
<i>It takes five of our best
to kill one of their worst.</i>

08:39.919 --> 08:41.599
<i>If you're lucky,
they'll just rip you apart,</i>

08:41.600 --> 08:44.279
<i>but they can also turn
you into one of them.</i>

08:44.280 --> 08:47.559
<i>Strigoi were the true
monsters of our nightmares.</i>

08:47.560 --> 08:50.919
<i>For all the stories, the warnings,
and the training films,</i>

08:50.920 --> 08:53.319
<i>I had never seen one up close.</i>

08:56.120 --> 08:58.322
I told you to stay in the car.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.401
We're clear.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.679
<i>And there it was.
Goodbye, Facebook.</i>

09:08.680 --> 09:10.439
<i>Goodbye, iPhone 5.</i>

09:10.440 --> 09:12.639
<i>Hello, St. Vladimir's.</i>

09:12.640 --> 09:14.559
<i>It is not just another school.</i>

09:14.560 --> 09:16.519
<i>It's another universe.</i>

09:16.520 --> 09:18.959
<i>Moroi and Dhampir students
come from all over the world</i>

09:18.960 --> 09:23.039
<i>to study history, science, math,
and all the other boring stuff,</i>

09:23.040 --> 09:24.519
<i>but around fourth period,</i>

09:24.520 --> 09:28.279
<i>we Dhampir go off and learn fun
new ways to maim and kill,</i>

09:28.280 --> 09:30.639
<i>while, for the Moroi,
it's magic time.</i>

09:30.640 --> 09:36.519
<i>Water, earth, fire, air.</i>

09:36.520 --> 09:40.279
<i>You see, it's not just their diet
that makes the Moroi special,</i>

09:40.280 --> 09:42.439
<i>and some are more
special than others.</i>

09:42.440 --> 09:44.359
<i>Our secret society has
its own government</i>

09:44.360 --> 09:47.239
<i>that alternates leaders
from 12 royal families.</i>

09:47.240 --> 09:50.999
<i>That's Queen Tatiana up top,
but my girl Lissa is in the mix.</i>

09:51.000 --> 09:54.319
<i>You can see why the princess leaving
the academy was such a scandal,</i>

09:54.320 --> 09:56.519
<i>and me helping her was worse.</i>

09:56.520 --> 09:59.159
Damn, back to Vampire Academy.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.279
Please don't say Vampire Academy.
You know how I feel about the "V" word.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.439
Sorry.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.118
It's not like the drinking of blood
is your main source of sustenance.

10:06.119 --> 10:07.959
No, wait, that's
exactly what it is.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.319
They just had to bring us back
in the middle of the night.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.759
So not cool... 1:00 a.m.,
end of fifth period.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.719
Ew, it looks like Aaron's
tried to replace you

10:18.720 --> 10:20.639
with a little keychain version.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.399
God, I hate high school.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.809
Princess. Headmistress
Kirova is ready for you.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.687
Come on.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.199
It's all so unprecedented. I'm at a
loss coming up with proper punishment.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.679
As Lissa's guardian...

10:35.680 --> 10:37.919
You're not an official
guardian, Hathaway.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.119
You are a novice.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.919
You put Vasilisa at the
mercy of the Strigoi,

10:41.920 --> 10:44.359
who would love to destroy,
or even worse, transform...

10:44.360 --> 10:46.119
It was my idea to leave.
Rose only did what...

10:46.120 --> 10:47.519
A trained guardian knows...

10:47.520 --> 10:49.359
Ellen, please.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.359
- Victor.
- Lissa.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.279
Ah.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.199
Prince Dashkov, you look so...

10:57.200 --> 11:01.159
Yes. My Sandovsky's
syndrome has gotten worse.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.959
Oh, Victor, we never
meant to worry you.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.959
Headmistress,

11:05.960 --> 11:09.839
these girls have been
through so much.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.799
As provost of this school

11:11.800 --> 11:15.439
and Lissa's father's oldest friend,

11:15.440 --> 11:17.919
I beg you, look into your heart.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.199
Vasilisa, I have the
utmost sympathy

11:21.200 --> 11:23.639
for the loss of your parents
and your brother, Andre.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.039
But why did you flee a
heavily guarded compound

11:27.040 --> 11:29.319
of Moroi students from
all over the world?

11:29.320 --> 11:31.199
It's not easy to explain.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.879
Lissa felt more in danger here
in your secure environment

11:34.880 --> 11:38.199
than on the outside as
an anonymous teenager.

11:38.200 --> 11:42.246
Fascinating. This is where
you give me specifics.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.999
Where's Ms. Karp?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.839
She should be here.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.359
She can maybe shed some
light onto the situation.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.291
Ms. Karp is no longer
part of this institution.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.767
I...

11:58.560 --> 12:00.719
This is where you give me specifics.
What do you mean?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.251
It's not important!

12:04.240 --> 12:09.079
Vasilisa Dragomir is from one
of the 12 royal families.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.679
She's the last of
the Dragomir line.

12:11.680 --> 12:16.999
With my condition taking the
Dashkov family out of contention,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.079
Lissa is a possible
successor to the throne.

12:21.080 --> 12:26.079
But you, Hathaway, a Dhampir
girl cut off from the community,

12:26.080 --> 12:31.079
out on civilian streets without a
dime or a Social Security number?

12:31.080 --> 12:33.479
"Blood whore" is such an ugly term,

12:33.480 --> 12:37.639
but I'm sure Moroi men on
business trips would pay a lot

12:37.640 --> 12:40.039
for the especially sweet taste.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.039
Headmistress Kirova.

12:42.040 --> 12:46.439
- They have the bond.
- That's... that's impossible.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.759
In my brief observation period,

12:48.760 --> 12:52.159
Rose could tell what Lissa
was thinking or feeling,

12:52.160 --> 12:54.279
sometimes without being
in the same place.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.679
What a rare and wonderful gift.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.959
This doesn't take away from the fact
that Rose Hathaway is wild, dangerous...

13:00.960 --> 13:04.519
- insubordinate, vulgar.
- Right here, folks. Right here.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.199
But the number of female Dhampir
guardians has gone down

13:07.200 --> 13:10.759
way too much to risk losing
one with such potential.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.399
Ellen, what this impressive new
guardian says seems reasonable.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.839
We're so sorry, Headmistress.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.199
After the crash, I lacked a strong
parental figure to confide in.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.559
I'm afraid Rose and I got
in way over our heads.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.127
Two crazy kids.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.959
Hathaway can stay, but no
extracurricular activities,

13:31.960 --> 13:36.279
no parties, no socializing,
nothing resembling fun.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.199
Take the princess to her royal quarters
and find a broom closet for...

13:39.200 --> 13:42.799
Oh, Rose, I almost forgot.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.639
A telegram.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.604
From Mom.

13:48.840 --> 13:52.079
<i>Kirova flipping out and Lissa
using compulsion to save my ass,</i>

13:52.080 --> 13:54.279
<i>just another night
at St. Vladimir's.</i>

13:54.280 --> 13:57.802
<i>Wow. This place definitely
brought back memories.</i>

13:58.560 --> 13:59.999
Come on, over here.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.999
Before the accident,
my father used to say

14:02.000 --> 14:06.559
that for a Moroi not declaring a magic
is like not going through puberty.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.999
Yeah, and he also used to
say practice during the day

14:09.000 --> 14:10.799
while the world,
your world, is sleeping.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.919
Let's make some magic.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.770
Perfect.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.090
Fire and water.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.041
That's my Moroi.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.479
- Rose...
- Don't leave me hanging.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.359
Rose, you know how I
feel about high-fives.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.559
Ladies. It's after 11:00 a.m., girls.
You should be in bed.

14:31.560 --> 14:35.199
The sun has cleared the trees,
and it won't be kind, Your Highness.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.719
I never got a chance to express
my condolences at the funeral.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.799
But I am so heartened

14:41.800 --> 14:46.599
by the extraordinary
recovery you've both made.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.879
And don't worry, Princess.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.399
I never officially
declared a magic, either.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.602
And look how I turned out.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.639
Ms. Karp's so different
from the other instructors.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.679
It's really refreshing.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.839
The thing that I like the most about her
is she's not strange or creepy at all.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.439
- It's hurt.
- It's more than hurt. It's done.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.085
Leave it. Come on, let...

15:26.160 --> 15:28.249
That was unique.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.239
Lissa.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.965
<i>Lissa?</i>

16:03.040 --> 16:04.679
Hey, Liss.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.919
- It's good to see you.
- Aaron.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.959
Guessing your new girlfriend
practices water magic. Classy.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.759
Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.599
Mia gets jealous, but
deep down, she's sweet.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.319
Back off, bitch. He's mine now.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.479
Very deep down, apparently.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.679
How does it feel to leave at the
top and come back at the bottom?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.359
Don't like what I'm saying?

16:22.360 --> 16:23.759
What are you gonna do about it?

16:23.760 --> 16:25.199
Thanks for asking.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.759
I'm gonna go to a quiet place

16:26.760 --> 16:29.167
and be very depressed
that this is my new life.

16:33.360 --> 16:37.639
<i>All Dhampir novices transfer
to the next training station.</i>

16:37.640 --> 16:40.319
<i>Everyone transfer to their
next training station.</i>

16:40.320 --> 16:42.399
Dimitri is a God.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.199
I hear he tracked
them down to Oregon,

16:44.200 --> 16:47.199
and when Rose tried to put up
a fight, he handed her her ass.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.959
And what was left of that ass got
chewed up by Headmistress Kirova.

16:49.960 --> 16:53.399
Surely, you have something more
interesting to discuss than my ass.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.799
- Your boobies?
- Quit while you're alive, Mason.

16:55.800 --> 16:56.959
What up, baby?

16:56.960 --> 16:58.679
Ooh.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.559
Forgot the secret handshake.
That hurts.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.559
You know, I'm gonna make you
pay for your booby comment.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.439
Old Rose maybe, but you've
missed a year of training.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.479
Yeah, you needed that year to catch
up with what I was born with.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.358
Prepare to...

17:10.359 --> 17:12.039
Ow!

17:12.040 --> 17:13.959
Sorry, Rose. Don't hate me.

17:13.960 --> 17:17.130
I'd hate you more if you held back.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.039
They have these things
in the outside world...

17:20.040 --> 17:22.559
Pinkberry and mini taquitos,

17:22.560 --> 17:25.047
Toaster Strudel...

17:26.079 --> 17:28.328
Oh, no. Not this again.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.559
Don't worry. I don't bite.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.439
Well... only literally.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.599
What are you doing here?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.079
This is where I come to get away.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.319
Hey, this was my... special place

17:57.320 --> 17:58.999
before it was your special place.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.199
What do you have to get
away from, Princess?

18:01.200 --> 18:04.519
What do you know about pain?
Break a nail off in your tiara?

18:04.520 --> 18:06.559
- Excuse me, after a car crash...
- You got off easy.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.923
How dare you! Do you have any idea
what it's like to lose your family?

18:11.480 --> 18:13.799
Oh. Sorry.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.639
You know you're talking to
Christian Ozera, right?

18:16.640 --> 18:19.079
Parents transformed
themselves into Strigoi...

18:19.080 --> 18:22.759
When your folks died,
there was a pretty funeral,

18:22.760 --> 18:24.450
and everybody cried.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.841
When my mother and father were
hunted down, everybody cheered.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.689
I hate what they chose to become...

18:34.880 --> 18:36.639
but they were still my parents.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.279
A Strigoi can't enter holy ground.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.399
Is that why you come to the church?

18:42.400 --> 18:44.399
To prove to everyone
you haven't turned?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.839
Get away from that freak.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.759
Maybe I just like the way the
moonlight hits this spot.

18:49.760 --> 18:53.759
It's as if you're
on another planet.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.799
What was it like...
outside the academy?

18:56.800 --> 19:00.039
It was kind of scary, just
the two of us out there,

19:00.040 --> 19:03.359
but... it was also kind of great.

19:03.360 --> 19:04.959
No one knew who I was.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.399
It does sound kind of great.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.599
But what did you do for blood?

19:09.600 --> 19:12.439
I mean, it's not like you
can pick it up at 7-Eleven.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.759
Or so I've read.

19:13.760 --> 19:17.079
Don't you say anything, girl.
People will get the wrong idea.

19:17.080 --> 19:22.159
You and Rose, all alone on the road.
I have my theories.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.439
Promise me you won't tell
your friends these theories.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.802
I promise you I have
no friends to tell.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.999
<i>Stop staring at each other all...</i>

19:31.000 --> 19:33.239
- ...gooey like.
- Hathaway!

19:33.240 --> 19:34.646
Look alive!

19:46.080 --> 19:47.759
Comrade Belikov.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.319
They ran me ragged. What do
you say we go easy today?

19:50.320 --> 19:54.799
- Perhaps discuss a bit of theory.
- Of course, Rose. I understand.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.119
How do you say
"what a dick" in Russian?

19:59.120 --> 20:00.799
Did you even go to a gym out there?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.479
I took a couple of
spinning classes.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.439
Do you really think beating me up is
gonna help me face a live Strigoi?

20:06.440 --> 20:07.999
After your performance last night,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.039
if you see a Strigoi,
I recommend running.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.919
Now, give me ten sets of lines.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.639
You know, this country has a concept
called "positive reinforcement."

20:14.640 --> 20:16.639
Rose, your bond is special.

20:16.640 --> 20:20.759
You're an ideal choice to guard
Vasilisa when you both graduate.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.839
But if you want to be with her,
you need to be ready for anything.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.519
- Ow!
- Wow.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.759
You look how I feel.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.959
I look how I feel.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.679
How's that "under the radar"
plan working out, Highness?

20:32.680 --> 20:34.479
Not so much.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.119
If you need a shoulder to cry on,

20:36.120 --> 20:39.039
use mine, not Christian Ozera's.

20:39.040 --> 20:43.519
- Who told you?
- I was sort of... you know, there.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.199
Oh, not again. That's so gross.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.479
I know, and it was, like,
the longest one yet.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.439
- You seriously can't turn it off?
- I don't know.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.239
Have you ever seen me
go to the bathroom?

20:51.240 --> 20:53.959
No, but thank you for giving me
something to look forward to.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.519
Oh, shut up. Oh!

20:56.520 --> 21:00.008
No wonder I'm so cranky.
I'm starving.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.959
<i>And now, for the obligatory
cafeteria scene, sort of.</i>

21:03.960 --> 21:05.839
<i>Ever wonder what happened
to that friend of yours,</i>

21:05.840 --> 21:08.199
<i>obsessed with vampire
books and shows?</i>

21:08.200 --> 21:10.439
<i>It's called the human
feeder program.</i>

21:10.440 --> 21:12.679
Human civilians systematically
giving their blood.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.239
I forgot how much
I did not miss this.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.919
Hey, no feeder is brought
here against their will.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.159
They can leave any time
that they want to.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.879
Yeah, it's just a
one-year service limit,

21:20.880 --> 21:23.679
and their memories are officially
compulsed upon departure.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.119
That's completely normal.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.599
Don't feel too sorry
for the feeders.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.439
If you recall, the bitee does get
something out of the process.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.439
- Oh, there's Norrine. Here.
- Hey! Look at you!

21:32.440 --> 21:34.881
- How are you?
- Yeah, good.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.690
Here.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.924
OK.

21:44.560 --> 21:48.079
Rose! Come and keep a
decrepit man company.

21:48.080 --> 21:52.199
Decrepit? You're just saying that so I
won't kick your ass in five-card draw.

21:52.200 --> 21:56.639
Tell me, my darling,
while you were gone,

21:56.640 --> 21:59.319
did Lissa get any
closer to declaring?

21:59.320 --> 22:02.079
There's not a lot of places to
practice magic in Portland.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.239
Oh, true, true.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.519
On the subject of non-declarers,

22:06.520 --> 22:08.759
I want to know why, when I brought
up Ms. Karp's name yesterday,

22:08.760 --> 22:11.159
you all acted like I put a
porcupine in a hot tub.

22:11.160 --> 22:18.199
Karp has always been a few
corpuscles shy of a full artery.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.879
She didn't have a Dhampir
to look after her.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.719
I know you have your
special bond with Lissa,

22:23.720 --> 22:26.399
but it makes your escape
that much more alarming.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.399
I'm on your side, Rose,

22:28.400 --> 22:31.399
but we live in a world where
the bogeymen are real.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.039
I know. I'm still a
little freaked-out.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.799
I was there last night when
that Strigoi attacked,

22:35.800 --> 22:37.479
and I just... I totally choked.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.479
Don't be so down on yourself, Rose.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.331
Why are you...

22:44.000 --> 22:47.639
I know you have your life
mission to protect Lissa,

22:47.640 --> 22:49.919
but would you now and again
look out for my Natalie?

22:49.920 --> 22:51.439
Mm...

22:51.440 --> 22:54.199
She's a goofball,
but I do cherish her.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.319
Yes. Well, she worships her father.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.559
She would do anything for you.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.119
I must go to her.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.970
Hey.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.159
Hi.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.479
Do I have anything...

23:04.480 --> 23:06.559
Just fat-lady feeder breath. Here.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.519
So, do you even know your feeders?

23:08.520 --> 23:11.399
Norrine's recently divorced, and
she's catching up on some me-time.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.239
She writes <i>Twilight</i> fan-fiction.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.839
- Have you read any of it?
- Oh, God, no.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.719
Rose, Princess Vasilisa.
I mean, Lissa.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.239
You said I could call you
Lissa, but if I can't anymore,

23:19.240 --> 23:20.999
- that's totally fine.
- Hello, Natalie.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.079
By the soul of St. Vlad's,
so much has happened.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.239
Nothing bigger than your escape,
of course. Why did you escape?

23:25.240 --> 23:27.519
Did you hear Sheila Flight and
Bruce Bugsburger broke up?

23:27.520 --> 23:30.119
Apparently, Bruce still has his baby
fangs, and it freaks Sheila out.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.559
<i>And you know about
Tess and Jackson?</i>

23:31.560 --> 23:33.479
Each was afraid that they're
gonna be the ones to get dumped,

23:33.480 --> 23:36.039
so they started this really weird
rumor. I can't really remember...

23:36.040 --> 23:37.759
Natalie? Do you take
gossip requests?

23:37.760 --> 23:39.599
Mia Rinaldi over there, is she new?

23:39.600 --> 23:42.159
Well, she's been around,
but new haircut, new fangs,

23:42.160 --> 23:43.799
and now she's hanging out
with all the royals.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.919
Rose Hathaway, what
are you doing here?

23:45.920 --> 23:48.839
Surely you would not deprive a
girl of her religious needs?

23:48.840 --> 23:51.199
Just get inside.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.079
The debate team, and
I don't really know if I...

23:53.080 --> 23:56.399
Speaking of extracurricular activities
that I miss, is that Jesse?

23:56.400 --> 23:58.239
The hot get hotter.

23:58.240 --> 24:01.519
Yeah, Jesse's still the academy's
number one wet dreamboat.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.399
He has a terrible personality.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.759
Jesse has a personality?

24:04.760 --> 24:06.159
I didn't know.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.719
Don't judge a book by its content.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.399
You know this is a church, right?

24:09.400 --> 24:11.239
Gosh, if only there was a way

24:11.240 --> 24:13.919
that we could set up a double
date with Ray over there.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.479
You can't tell me that there's no
inbreeding amongst you royals.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.119
Exhibit Ray.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.079
Ray just doesn't know how
to express his feelings.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.679
You know, when a boy throws
sand in a girl's face,

24:23.680 --> 24:25.599
it really means that...

24:25.600 --> 24:27.370
Never mind.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.841
Yeah.

24:30.840 --> 24:34.039
- Your friend's a tool.
- Don't change the subject.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.759
You, me... you and me.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.719
Yeah, but don't you
have a girlfriend?

24:38.720 --> 24:40.919
- Probably.
- Oh, you are bad.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.599
What's so bad about bad?

24:47.480 --> 24:49.719
You do understand, Rose,
that even the walls of a church

24:49.720 --> 24:52.279
can't protect a true sinner
from a good lightning bolt?

24:52.280 --> 24:55.689
Save a seat for me in the
Dhampir section, you dork.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.399
Mason likes you so much.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.679
Why can't you go outwith a
nice, funny guy like him?

25:01.680 --> 25:04.679
I know. If only I could put
Mason into Jesse's body.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.559
God can be cruel.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.650
Yes. That's true.

25:11.280 --> 25:14.290
Come on. Let's go.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.999
<i>Following God's path is never easy.</i>

25:17.000 --> 25:19.839
Even St. Vladimir had
difficulty controlling

25:19.840 --> 25:23.039
and understanding his powers.

25:23.040 --> 25:26.119
But he was bound to a
loving Dhampir guardian

25:26.120 --> 25:29.359
who always knew what was
in his heart and mind.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.119
Shadow-kissed Anna.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.919
Shadow-kissed Rose,

25:33.920 --> 25:37.159
you're bound to Lissa, and
it's up to you to help her.

25:56.360 --> 25:58.759
What's so funny?
Did you write that?

25:58.760 --> 26:00.599
Down, Dhampir,
you saw me in church.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.359
Listen, Gap Kids, if I find out

26:02.360 --> 26:04.639
that you had anything to do
with that, I will rip your...

26:04.640 --> 26:07.999
You'll what? You're on lockdown.
You breathe the wrong way

26:08.000 --> 26:10.239
and you're out on the pavement
doing amateur blood whore porn.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.679
Listen up, that's enough
excitement for a Sunday night.

26:13.680 --> 26:16.963
Everyone back to your dorms
until further notice.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.759
Royal rec room, high noon.
I've changed my mind.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.319
I'm feeling bad.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.885
Good.

26:30.040 --> 26:34.479
We Moroi may not burst
into flames like Strigoi,

26:34.480 --> 26:37.279
but daylight still stings.

26:37.280 --> 26:39.244
Poor thing.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.399
Did you have jobs out in the world?

26:45.400 --> 26:46.879
What about an iPhone?

26:46.880 --> 26:49.924
- What's a hashtag?
- Please, stop talking.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.959
Whoa, horsey, what do
you think you're doing?

26:57.960 --> 27:02.165
Come on, Rose. A bite while
you're going at it is the best.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.559
Stop it!

27:07.560 --> 27:10.599
Oh... I know that look.
You've done it before.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.479
I would never let a guy
degrade me like that.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.639
Not a guy, of course. Lissa.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.479
We've all been
wondering how she fed.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.519
Once you've had fang,
Rose, you never go...

27:19.520 --> 27:21.639
Daytime fraternization. Forbidden.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.559
I get it. Chill, chill.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.759
Again, Jesse? Back to your room!

27:26.760 --> 27:29.281
What?

27:40.520 --> 27:42.370
Lissa, what are you doing?

27:53.520 --> 27:55.839
- Rose?
- Lissa's in trouble.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.879
I heard... I heard a noise.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.319
Lissa...

28:05.320 --> 28:07.719
There's so much blood.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.759
It's starting again, isn't it?

28:09.760 --> 28:12.319
I tried, Rose, I tried
to bring it back,

28:12.320 --> 28:14.807
but... it was too late.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.241
Get over here and
comfort her, jerk.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.169
It's gonna be OK.

28:28.880 --> 28:32.279
- What the hell is Kirova doing?
- She's giving Vasilisa a sedative,

28:32.280 --> 28:34.879
and we are increasing
her guardian detail.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.959
Our security system is geared
to keeping Strigoi out,

28:36.960 --> 28:38.999
not dealing with teenage
bullying within.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.799
Bullying? You really think
that's all this is?

28:40.800 --> 28:43.162
- Rose...
- Sorry.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.959
Thank you for not saying
anything to Kirova about...

28:47.960 --> 28:53.279
it was foolish of me to assume you'd
be above such 17-year-old silliness.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.563
Hmm. Hmm...

28:58.520 --> 29:01.399
The sunlight, it's nice.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.559
I miss it.

29:03.560 --> 29:07.039
Stupid vampire timetable.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.971
The little sacrifices we make.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.039
And the big ones.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.079
My 17-year-old silliness,
that was the past.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.879
That was an hour ago.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.479
Are you trying to tell me you're
suddenly mature and responsible?

29:19.480 --> 29:22.319
I'm trying to tell you that
I want to be, I have to be.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.079
Teach me something
more than doing laps.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.679
I know enough about running away.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.479
And next time we meet,
teach me how to fight.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.519
Pipe down. Let's pick
up where we left off.

29:41.520 --> 29:45.919
After the tribunals
in Romania... Mia!

29:45.920 --> 29:47.999
You're usually a lot better
at passing on notes.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.119
- Having an off-day?
- Oh, no, Mr. Meisner,

29:51.120 --> 29:54.085
please don't read this note
out loud, I beg of you.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.959
"I'll bet that drama queen..."

29:56.960 --> 29:59.719
"I mean, drama princess,
killed that fox herself"

29:59.720 --> 30:01.999
"to distract the school
from her real secret."

30:02.000 --> 30:03.359
Don't go on.

30:03.360 --> 30:07.319
Mr. Meisner, you're being used as a tool
to broadcast Mia's vile propaganda.

30:07.320 --> 30:08.639
Are you calling me a tool?

30:08.640 --> 30:11.719
- If she's not, I will.
- What was that, Hathaway?

30:11.720 --> 30:14.759
Now I'm curious.
"So, it turns out the reason"

30:14.760 --> 30:17.119
"that Lissa survived so
long on the outside"

30:17.120 --> 30:20.919
"is she used Rose as a
personal feed bag."

30:20.920 --> 30:23.319
Settle down!

30:23.320 --> 30:27.081
Dhampir-Moroi mastication is
a very serious allegation.

30:27.720 --> 30:30.119
I'm gonna pretend
I never read this.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.839
Everyone turn to page
three of your handout.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.359
But, Mr. Meisner, you
left out the best part.

30:34.360 --> 30:38.199
About me and my boy, Jesse,
and that Dhamp tramp last night.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.079
- What?
- Truth hurts, blood whore.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.319
Christian, cut it out!

30:49.320 --> 30:52.519
Kindly report to Headmistress
Kirova's office, Mr. Ozera.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.246
- Down the hall, turn left.
- Like I need directions.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.119
Lissa, Lissa, wait up.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.679
Not here, not in front of everyone.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.839
What was that back there?
Fire magic in class?

31:05.840 --> 31:09.359
- Uh-oh. Lovers' quarrel.
- Rose, I bleed for you.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.919
No, it's Rose who
does the bleeding.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.799
You can't beat up everyone
we have a problem with!

31:14.800 --> 31:16.959
- Well, I can try.
- What is going on?

31:16.960 --> 31:20.759
I told you, Jesse and I barely even
made out, and Ray wasn't even there,

31:20.760 --> 31:22.279
so I don't even know
what he's talking about.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.959
OK, yes. Teenage boys are
weak and sweaty piglets.

31:23.960 --> 31:27.279
It is our covenant...
I'm talking about you and me.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.919
How did they find out
about the feeding?

31:28.920 --> 31:30.719
You know, when Jesse's fangs
came poking out, did you...

31:30.720 --> 31:33.039
No, not even.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.839
But... he did kind of suspect.

31:36.840 --> 31:39.407
Lissa, let me explain, please!
Let me talk...

31:40.160 --> 31:41.319
Is it true?

31:41.320 --> 31:43.119
You're gonna have to be
more specific, Mason.

31:43.120 --> 31:46.079
Jesse and Ray, and not just
hooking up, fanging up.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.799
- They claim they fed while...
- Absolutely not...

31:48.800 --> 31:52.239
Well, actually, Jesse and I
did make out a little, but...

31:52.240 --> 31:54.879
- Where there's smoke, there's fire.
- Leave fire out of this.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.199
You girls throw yourselves
at any douche bag

31:57.200 --> 31:58.638
who happens to be Moroi and royal.

31:58.639 --> 32:02.079
Whoa, Duckie. I do not have time to
deal with your feelings right now.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.169
OK.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.244
Oh, God, come on, Lissa-vision.
Where are you when I need you?

32:11.520 --> 32:13.959
You should thank me for
changing the news cycle.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.679
It took something epic to take
animal death and blood whoring

32:16.680 --> 32:18.359
off the Vampire Academy front page.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.599
Please don't say "Vampire Academy."

32:19.600 --> 32:21.519
I find the term to be quite...

32:21.520 --> 32:23.359
You set someone on fire!

32:23.360 --> 32:26.439
Come on. Did you see
any burn marks on him?

32:26.440 --> 32:29.039
Now whoever killed that fox is
going to feel the real heat.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.879
Is this your idea of chivalry?

32:30.880 --> 32:33.359
You did not just
flip your hair back.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.559
That's your move.
She's flirting, folks.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.919
If we used our magic as a weapon,

32:37.920 --> 32:40.319
instead of just for warm and
fuzzy classroom exercises,

32:40.320 --> 32:42.199
the Strigoi wouldn't
be picking us off.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.119
- Yes, but the rules forbid...
- The rules?

32:44.120 --> 32:47.599
Lissa, I've seen the way you tilt
your head from time to time.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.919
I'm very sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:49.920 --> 32:53.999
Hey, compulsion must have been
a necessity in the outside world.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.524
You can't know all my secrets. Yet.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.644
Queen Tatiana?

33:17.880 --> 33:21.079
I hope I did not take you
too much by surprise,

33:21.080 --> 33:25.879
but sometimes your queen awakens
with a need to look upon her lovelies.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.560
Where's Vasilisa?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.968
Vasilisa Dragomir?

33:33.280 --> 33:36.519
Please come up and let
me see the princess.

33:36.520 --> 33:40.359
Not a day goes by
where we don't lament

33:40.360 --> 33:43.079
the loss of your parents
and your brother.

33:43.080 --> 33:48.764
The Dragomir name represents
the finest of Moroi qualities.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.839
While you, Vasilisa Dragomir,

33:52.840 --> 33:56.089
the last of the Dragomir line...

33:57.240 --> 34:00.759
if you are our future,
I am less than impressed.

34:00.760 --> 34:06.879
The power that comes from royal
blood must be used responsibly.

34:06.880 --> 34:11.239
While you... you give us
dead animals, blood games,

34:11.239 --> 34:13.918
escapes to Oregon. Shameful!

34:13.920 --> 34:15.839
- Queen Tatiana, I can explain.
- Shh, shh, shh.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.279
Not now, dear.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.998
However, I have every confidence

34:21.000 --> 34:25.518
that our dear Vasilisa
will turn things around.

34:25.520 --> 34:30.009
Now, let us adjourn
to the banquet hall.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.759
My father would never have
done something like that.

34:44.760 --> 34:48.478
After all that Lissa has been through,
to be shamed by our queen bee?

34:48.480 --> 34:50.239
Don't you mean queen bee-etch?

34:50.239 --> 34:52.159
You don't talk to Lissa like that.

34:52.159 --> 34:55.250
So much for round-the-clock
guardians.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.006
Lissa?

34:58.480 --> 34:59.719
Oh, my God.

34:59.720 --> 35:03.679
- By the soul of St. Vladimir.
- Who would do something like this? Why?

35:03.680 --> 35:05.519
Go to the wall, Nat. Talk to me.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.279
What?

35:07.280 --> 35:09.323
Yeah, OK.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.610
Oh, God.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.479
- It's fresh, and it's Moroi.
- OK, can you tell me if it's royal?

35:21.480 --> 35:24.490
- Don't be absurd.
- Said the girl licking the wall.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.799
I can tell you it's more
than one person's blood.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.799
They misspelled "beware."

35:32.800 --> 35:34.799
Lissa, I can clean it up.
I'm sorry.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.439
Leave it. The misspelling shows it was
just a bunch of stupid teenagers.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.919
OK, you know what, I'm gonna
go start packing. I'm really...

35:40.920 --> 35:43.359
No, Rose. We can't just keep running
away, at least until we know

35:43.360 --> 35:44.639
what we're running away from.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.719
Ooh! A mystery, how exciting.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.679
We can be like three
Nancy Drews trying...

35:48.680 --> 35:52.079
I hate mysteries. I would prefer a
good Strigoi attack at this point

35:52.080 --> 35:54.159
because at least I'd know what
those homicidal bloodsuckers want.

35:54.160 --> 35:57.439
No more. I am taking our
dear beloved queen's advice,

35:57.440 --> 35:59.639
and I'm turning things around.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.479
Jesse and Ray are pawns.
Mia is the mastermind.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.359
Yeah, but we didn't even
really know Mini-Mia

36:04.360 --> 36:06.119
when we were compelled to
leave for the first time.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.279
Ms. Karp is the one that
we should be focused on.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.239
Do what you have to do, Dhampir. I am
done trying to crawl under the radar.

36:11.240 --> 36:14.119
It's not possible, and...
it's not effective.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.919
Besides, I have a way of getting
people to see my side of the story.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.319
Don't worry, Natalie
knows of my skills.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.119
It was too exhausting
keeping it from her.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.319
Are you going to use
compulsion on Mia?

36:25.320 --> 36:27.239
Where's the fun in that?

36:27.240 --> 36:29.919
I'm going to use compulsion
on everyone but Mia.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.559
But compulsion on
such a large scale...

36:31.560 --> 36:34.559
Magic should be used for something more
than warm and fuzzy classroom exercises.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.519
Oh, God, and now you're
quoting Christian?

36:36.520 --> 36:37.919
- What?
- Yeah, I was there.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.639
And the poison that that freak

36:39.640 --> 36:41.719
is pumping into your brain
makes me want to vomit.

36:41.720 --> 36:45.639
Lissa, I'm the reckless, and
you're the cautious, remember?

36:45.640 --> 36:48.039
You've already taken too
many hits for me, Rose.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.159
Look, it's your turn
to have a little cry,

36:51.160 --> 36:53.727
and it's my turn to
kick a little ass.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.799
Whoa!

37:00.800 --> 37:02.639
You do not jump out at
a guardian like that.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.039
I think you mean novice.

37:04.040 --> 37:07.239
Just wanted to know
if Lissa was all right.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.279
Queen Tatiana had no right
to bring up family.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.439
- I should go and talk to Lissa.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.799
But I do. Lissa and I have a bond.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.399
A bond?

37:16.400 --> 37:19.279
Listen, Chris,
just stay away from her.

37:19.280 --> 37:23.239
She's had her little flirtation
with the dark side, and she's done.

37:23.240 --> 37:27.079
Lissa used to like Hot Topic,
too, and then she turned 12.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.639
I was only concerned.

37:29.640 --> 37:33.319
There's a fine line between
concerned and stalker.

37:33.320 --> 37:35.479
Seriously, Christian, go away.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.967
It's what Lissa wants.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.285
OK.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.239
I thought we'd practice out
here, away from there.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.519
Dimitri, I know you must
have heard some rumors.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.439
All that high-school <i>der'mo</i>
stays back there, not here.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.999
This is life and death.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.959
The silver. Don't be afraid of it.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.359
Besides the sun, this stake is your
only friend against the Strigoi.

38:07.360 --> 38:10.199
But you must subdue the monster
and bring yourself to kill.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.079
Yeah, killing Strigoi is
what it's all about, right?

38:14.080 --> 38:16.039
Most Strigoi were once Moroi.

38:16.040 --> 38:19.079
Some turn themselves Strigoi by
killing during the feeding process.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.719
But many are turned by force.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.719
If you are going to thrust, thrust.

38:22.720 --> 38:25.519
My point is you might have known
one personally, as a friend.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.529
Can you kill someone
you used to know?

38:27.840 --> 38:32.279
I... If it was them
or me or Lissa...

38:32.280 --> 38:34.839
You hesitate, and that
hesitation could kill you.

38:34.840 --> 38:39.119
You have to keep telling yourself that
they aren't the same people you knew.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.719
Good. Very good.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.279
I don't mean to belittle
what you are going through.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.079
The queen crossed a line.

38:46.080 --> 38:49.999
But the Dhampir must always bow down.
I get it. The Moroi come first.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.999
Not always. My father was a Moroi.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.239
He visited Russia once a year.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.359
He liked to hit my mother.

38:57.360 --> 38:59.479
When I was old enough,
I liked to hit him.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.239
He stopped visiting.

39:01.240 --> 39:04.239
- How old is old enough?
- Ten.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.439
The only parent I've ever
really had is the academy.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.039
Your mother is one
of the most feared

39:11.040 --> 39:13.559
and respected Dhampir
guardians in the world.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.399
I see you finally
read her telegram.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.039
You want to know what it said?

39:17.040 --> 39:21.599
"Glad you're alive. What you
did was inexcusable. Mom."

39:21.600 --> 39:22.759
Aw.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.839
What do you know of
your Moroi father?

39:24.840 --> 39:29.199
That he must have had dark
eyes and amazing hair.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.799
When I start killing
Strigoi left and right,

39:30.800 --> 39:32.639
I'm gonna have to cut
it all off, won't I?

39:32.640 --> 39:34.999
Sorry. That sounded really girly.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.159
You can wear it up.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.639
Doesn't a Dhampir need to keep
their <i>molnija</i> marks exposed?

39:40.640 --> 39:44.162
Don't ever cut your hair.
Wear it up.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.559
You have to admire our queen.

39:51.560 --> 39:55.359
Her elegance, her dignity, her
ability to recognize trash.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.359
And my good mood is over.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.803
You know, "beware" isn't
spelled with an "H" in it.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.679
- Hey.
- Where's Lissa?

40:07.680 --> 40:09.199
I haven't seen her, but guess what?

40:09.200 --> 40:10.599
I heard that Mia and
Aaron are going

40:10.600 --> 40:12.239
on that field trip to
the hemoglobin factory.

40:12.240 --> 40:14.039
I figured it gives us a
chance to raid their rooms...

40:14.040 --> 40:18.211
- Pretend to be talking to me.
- But I am talking to you.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.799
It's nasty. If you
guys were doing it,

40:22.800 --> 40:25.239
I'm not surprised Rose got
addicted and necked with Jesse.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.119
She didn't do it with Jesse.

40:27.120 --> 40:30.959
And it's not like we fornicated.
We just didn't have any feeders.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.079
It's no big deal, Camilla.

40:33.080 --> 40:36.959
Yeah, it's no big deal.
I mean, Jesse's a liar.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.599
What are you guys doing tonight?

40:38.600 --> 40:41.599
Shannon and I are going to her
room to study for Meisner's test.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.079
Invite me.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.759
Lissa, you want to
study with us tonight?

40:45.760 --> 40:47.849
<i>Sure.</i>

40:49.640 --> 40:52.319
Oh, look. It's the
queen's court jester.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.919
You can't talk to me like that.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.359
The queen treats me like a daughter,
so you should be envious.

40:56.360 --> 40:59.639
You're buds with Mia. What
secrets are you keeping?

40:59.640 --> 41:02.039
- I like to wear my mommy's knick...
- Not about you.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.969
Secrets about Mia.

41:14.320 --> 41:15.959
- Busted.
- Ow.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.759
Did you witness how amazing I was?

41:17.760 --> 41:22.799
I felt it. Using the power has an
effect, a cost, on both of us.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.159
Look at you, you're shaking.
I'm shaking.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.639
Three cups of coffee shaking.

41:26.640 --> 41:29.079
More like 18 cups,
dark roast, no room.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.919
- I got it, the computer.
- What?

41:30.920 --> 41:32.639
I told you.
Mia's on a field trip...

41:32.640 --> 41:35.319
Hey, you. I'm sorry I haven't
been to church in a while, but...

41:35.320 --> 41:38.079
It's OK. You don't have
to pretend anymore.

41:38.080 --> 41:41.039
You've had your little
flirtation with the dark side.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.799
- Check that box and move on.
- What are you talking about?

41:43.800 --> 41:46.890
But, hey, nice hypocrisy
on the magic use.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.839
So what? A stolen laptop.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.239
Kirova strangled Internet
access years ago.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.319
Yeah, St. Vlad's operates
on a closed network,

41:56.320 --> 41:58.359
but there is more to a
person than status updates.

41:58.360 --> 42:01.919
There's photos, receipts,
inter-academy e-mails.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.639
You're making my brain bleed.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.968
But you were sure right
about cuckoo Christian.

42:06.520 --> 42:07.721
What a whack job.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.999
Are you seriously going to
that study group with Camilla?

42:12.000 --> 42:14.119
You know, you don't have to
use compulsion to be popular.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.599
You may not recall, but you can
be quite charming on your own.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.399
Who has the time? Natalie,
return that computer.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.679
Later, losers.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.999
Gosh.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.279
I wish Lissa could compulse
Ray into being nicer.

42:26.280 --> 42:28.959
And taking my virginity.

42:28.960 --> 42:30.799
No one has ever
really seen me naked.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.959
- Moroi, Dhampir, human, mineral.
- Uh-huh.

42:32.960 --> 42:35.719
I once turned a plant around because
I was too shy to change in front of it.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.239
You know I can't
un-hear this, right?

42:37.240 --> 42:40.359
- Sorry. Yeah, I...
- It's OK.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.799
Though I'm not much better.
I'm crushing on my mentor, Dimitri,

42:42.800 --> 42:45.039
who's, like, old enough to be my...

42:45.040 --> 42:47.799
Not my father... like an uncle.

42:47.800 --> 42:50.559
Like a disturbingly sexy uncle.

42:50.560 --> 42:51.807
Andre?

42:52.560 --> 42:53.719
What the hell is this?

42:53.720 --> 42:56.119
Goodness gracious.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.479
Andre, Andre?

42:57.480 --> 42:59.039
That's Lissa's brother, isn't it?

42:59.040 --> 43:02.359
Andre could have, like, any girl
he wanted, and he usually did.

43:02.360 --> 43:06.399
Most of the girls knew the drill.
It was down low, no commitments and...

43:06.400 --> 43:09.119
This is the face of a girl
who did not know the drill.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.559
Holy moly.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.919
Mia's not just angry at Lissa.
She despises the whole Dragomir line.

43:13.920 --> 43:17.519
Right, which makes her someone willing
to take things to a whole other level.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.479
OK, all right. Take this
back to Mia's room.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.125
- Yeah?
- OK.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.406
See ya.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.999
Hey. To what do I owe this honor?

43:29.000 --> 43:30.406
Can we talk, Oscar?

43:31.400 --> 43:33.279
<i>I'm worried about Lissa.</i>

43:33.280 --> 43:36.639
<i>I love that our princess is learning
that the best defense is a good offense,</i>

43:36.640 --> 43:40.679
<i>and believe me, I am all for putting
mad munchkin Mia in her place,</i>

43:40.680 --> 43:46.319
<i>but this Operation Brainwash is turning
Lissa into something she's not.</i>

43:46.320 --> 43:48.602
<i>She can't see that. I can.</i>

43:49.400 --> 43:52.126
<i>It's like I feel Lissa's
feelings more than she does.</i>

43:52.960 --> 43:54.719
<i>I need to put on my game face.</i>

43:54.720 --> 43:57.359
<i>Can't wait around for my
next psychedelic flashback.</i>

43:57.360 --> 43:58.999
<i>The stakes are too high.</i>

43:59.000 --> 44:00.519
<i>Get it?</i>

44:00.520 --> 44:02.039
<i>Dhampir? Fight with stakes?</i>

44:02.040 --> 44:03.759
<i>Best defense, good offense.</i>

44:14.280 --> 44:15.559
I knew you'd improve.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.039
No fair learning from a god.

44:18.040 --> 44:20.080
I heard you were good at
taking on two guys at once.

44:25.160 --> 44:27.239
Rose, uh, about Jesse and Ray...

44:27.240 --> 44:29.439
- Mason...
- No, not that.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.759
In the locker room, it was weird.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.599
<i>They had these bandages
on their wrists.</i>

44:33.600 --> 44:35.279
<i>I don't know if it means anything.</i>

44:35.280 --> 44:36.799
<i>Covered wrists?</i>

44:36.800 --> 44:39.651
- Is that some new Moroi thing?
- Check out Mia.

44:55.240 --> 44:57.759
- She's getting away.
- Let her.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.439
Kirova's the one I
should be tracking.

45:00.440 --> 45:01.959
I need to break into
Kirova's office today

45:01.960 --> 45:04.159
when the fang gang is asleep, OK?

45:04.160 --> 45:06.719
There's a file in there that
could be the key to my past,

45:06.720 --> 45:09.239
my present and my future.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.279
That's it?

45:11.280 --> 45:12.479
Sounds cool.

45:14.640 --> 45:16.479
Forty-five minutes of silence.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.359
It has to be a Rose
Hathaway record.

45:18.360 --> 45:19.919
OK.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.879
What do you know about Ms. Karp?

45:21.880 --> 45:25.639
Karp? She retired
before I even arrived.

45:25.640 --> 45:29.439
Kirova, Victor, you.

45:29.440 --> 45:33.929
I ask about Karp, and it's no eye
contact and a subject change.

45:36.440 --> 45:40.639
Enough. Your training of
late has been quite...

45:40.640 --> 45:42.999
- ...fine.
- Fine? That's it?

45:43.000 --> 45:44.999
What do you want me to say?

45:45.000 --> 45:46.879
That you are a
remarkable quick study?

45:46.880 --> 45:49.359
That you bring originality
to classic moves?

45:49.360 --> 45:52.839
Yeah, I want you to
say all those things.

45:52.840 --> 45:54.769
Good night, Rose.

45:59.480 --> 46:01.879
What did I do wrong? I had you.

46:01.880 --> 46:04.399
The battle cry was
your first mistake.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.559
I like your laugh.
Singular, not plural.

46:07.560 --> 46:09.599
It's the first time I've heard it.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.559
So even if I wouldn't have screamed,
you still would have stopped me, right?

46:12.560 --> 46:15.399
Probably, but nice initiative.

46:15.400 --> 46:19.161
Keep trying those surprise attacks.
It's good training for both of us.

46:21.240 --> 46:26.321
So, uh... you have any other
moves you want to show me?

46:56.320 --> 46:58.998
<i>I give it and they take it, but when it
comes back, it's not the same, is it?</i>

46:58.999 --> 47:00.719
<i>I give it and they take it,</i>

47:00.720 --> 47:02.640
<i>but when it comes back,
it's not the same, is it?</i>

47:03.960 --> 47:06.839
<i>They're coming to get me.</i>

47:06.840 --> 47:09.559
<i>But they want something
that I can't give them.</i>

47:09.560 --> 47:12.439
<i>Those of us who never declared, those of
us who have powers that have no name,</i>

47:12.440 --> 47:16.279
<i>there's only so much we can do,
only so much we can handle.</i>

47:16.280 --> 47:19.319
<i>I should have gone with Vasilisa.
I should have.</i>

47:19.320 --> 47:20.799
<i>I'm so alone.</i>

47:20.800 --> 47:24.239
<i>The clarity of the
darkness beckons.</i>

47:24.240 --> 47:27.639
<i>I just want it to go
away, the shaking,</i>

47:27.640 --> 47:31.811
<i>the scratching,
nightmares, all go away.</i>

47:36.160 --> 47:40.319
Lissa. The king and queen of
the school together again,

47:40.320 --> 47:42.719
- the way it should be.
- Lissa!

47:42.720 --> 47:44.919
It's you and I who are
destined to be together.

47:44.920 --> 47:46.359
Let me handle this.

47:46.360 --> 47:50.119
Look at what you made me do to
myself, just like my damn parents.

47:51.760 --> 47:53.041
Lissa!

47:56.680 --> 47:58.519
I have a new family now.

47:58.520 --> 48:01.039
Strigoi brothers and
sisters, attack!

48:23.160 --> 48:25.239
- Rose, what's happening?
- Stay close, right behind me,

48:25.240 --> 48:26.680
just like we practiced.

48:38.680 --> 48:41.319
OK. It's not looking great,

48:41.320 --> 48:43.522
but we will get through this,
Lissa, we always do.

48:46.560 --> 48:48.125
Dimitri?

48:54.240 --> 48:57.679
Oh, Rose, you worry too much.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.039
Lissa, no.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.839
What are friends for?

49:01.840 --> 49:03.280
No.

49:04.840 --> 49:06.610
No!

49:08.320 --> 49:10.639
Rose, are you there?

49:10.640 --> 49:12.922
Did you feel that one?

49:14.040 --> 49:15.730
What a weird dream.

49:17.800 --> 49:22.319
Yeah. Yeah, Liss, weird dream.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.639
Don't you dare feel sorry for me.

49:37.640 --> 49:40.844
Feel sorry for her,
for the princess.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.359
I lied.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.079
Lissa doesn't think that
you're a creepy stalker.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.359
She actually likes you.

49:53.360 --> 49:54.839
Then why did you...?

49:54.840 --> 49:56.599
Because I think that
you're a creepy stalker,

49:56.600 --> 49:58.879
and I actually don't
like you, but...

49:58.880 --> 50:01.970
I like the way that Lissa
feels when she's around you.

50:02.840 --> 50:04.799
So what?

50:04.800 --> 50:07.799
Look at her. She's back on top.

50:07.800 --> 50:11.399
She's not happy. She's not
herself, not as she wants to be.

50:11.400 --> 50:12.719
Trust me, I know, Christian.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.959
I can f...

50:14.960 --> 50:17.479
Shadow-kissed Anna
did all she could,

50:17.480 --> 50:20.639
but on some days, Satan's darkness

50:20.640 --> 50:24.919
seeped into St. Vladimir,
weakening his health and mind.

50:24.920 --> 50:27.919
See, Christian, I don't
want that to be Lissa.

50:27.920 --> 50:31.039
You are the phantom here. You must know
where they keep the books and scrolls

50:31.040 --> 50:33.479
and whatnot, and I need to
figure out what her abilities...

50:33.480 --> 50:36.799
You sabotaged the first good thing
to happen to me in a long time,

50:36.800 --> 50:39.207
and now you want me to help you?

50:40.240 --> 50:41.885
Ugh. God.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.368
Princess party in
the royal rec room.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.199
There's my blood bitch.
What took you so long?

50:54.000 --> 50:55.559
It's great that you
can joke about it.

50:55.560 --> 50:58.759
Lissa, listen. A lot has happened.

50:58.760 --> 51:00.879
We have to sit down and
have a real conversation.

51:00.880 --> 51:04.050
Stop being so serious, Rose.
It's a party.

51:05.600 --> 51:08.690
- Hey, Natalie.
- Hi.

51:12.280 --> 51:14.164
Awesome party, huh?

51:14.840 --> 51:16.319
Check this.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.839
Can you say "keg magic"?

51:23.840 --> 51:26.599
Wow, Lissa, you can
really do it all.

51:26.600 --> 51:27.879
Well, of course I can.
I'm the princess.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.999
But doing it all is wrong, right?

51:30.000 --> 51:34.599
Fire, air, fire, air, fire,

51:34.600 --> 51:36.799
air, fire, air,

51:36.800 --> 51:38.719
- fire...
- Hey.

51:38.720 --> 51:41.651
Aaron.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.559
Rose! Where are you going?

51:49.560 --> 51:51.239
You weren't just going to
bail without saying goodbye.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.679
I need to go home
and sleep you off.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.679
Oh, is the bond making
you as buzzed as I am?

51:54.680 --> 51:56.199
God, you are burning
us both out on magic.

51:56.200 --> 51:57.999
Stop worrying. It's working.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.439
Weeks have gone by,
and Mia is toast.

52:00.440 --> 52:02.919
No threats, no notes, no foxes.

52:02.920 --> 52:06.639
You're just bummed that I, not
you, have neutralized the threat.

52:06.640 --> 52:09.759
You neutralized a threat,
not "the" threat.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.279
And Aaron, seriously,

52:11.280 --> 52:13.239
you really want to show up to
the Equinox Dance with that?

52:13.240 --> 52:15.119
He's... cute.

52:15.120 --> 52:17.199
And incredibly boring.

52:17.200 --> 52:18.519
You think everyone's boring.

52:18.520 --> 52:19.679
Christian's not.

52:19.680 --> 52:22.279
No, you were right about him.

52:24.720 --> 52:29.679
I knew "little flirtation with the dark
side" sounded like one of your lines.

52:29.680 --> 52:31.799
- Sorry.
- You know what? You can have Christian.

52:31.800 --> 52:34.119
You're both savages.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.359
Lissa, what I've been
trying to tell you

52:36.360 --> 52:38.279
is that you're making
this about high school,

52:38.280 --> 52:39.759
and it's about something more.

52:46.440 --> 52:48.879
Natalie... Are you nuts?
What are you thinking?

52:48.880 --> 52:51.519
Trust me, you do not want to have
to get a nose job in Montana!

52:51.520 --> 52:53.559
Sorry. I'm sorry. It's...

52:53.560 --> 52:55.919
When you both left the
party, I had no one to...

52:55.920 --> 52:57.959
Everyone kept staring
at me, so I left,

52:57.960 --> 53:01.279
and on my way back to the
dorms, I swear, someone...

53:01.280 --> 53:03.879
more like something,
started to follow me.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.199
I just... I don't know. I'm
probably just being paranoid.

53:08.760 --> 53:11.279
That's not paranoia.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.719
- That's a psi-hound.
- Rose thinks everything is a psi-hound.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.319
What's a psi-hound?

53:30.560 --> 53:32.888
- What's my backpack doing over there?
- Lissa, no.

53:43.560 --> 53:44.886
Lissa!

53:46.800 --> 53:48.999
Oscar! Oh, my God.

53:51.400 --> 53:53.329
Oscar.

53:54.800 --> 53:56.570
- Lissa, just...
- No, Rose!

54:09.400 --> 54:12.679
Shadow-kissed Rose,
you're bound to Lissa,

54:12.680 --> 54:14.319
and it's up to you to help her.

54:14.320 --> 54:16.279
Don't you understand?

54:16.280 --> 54:19.679
The more that Lissa uses her
powers, the worse it'll get.

54:19.680 --> 54:21.079
The more dangerous it will be.

54:21.080 --> 54:24.439
They came for me.
They'll come for her.

54:24.440 --> 54:26.839
What are you talking about?
Is it the Strigoi?

54:28.360 --> 54:30.319
This isn't about Strigoi.

54:30.320 --> 54:34.319
Not everything to be feared roams
outside the gates of St. Vladimir's.

54:34.320 --> 54:36.679
- I don't understand.
- Oh, you couldn't understand it.

54:36.680 --> 54:40.359
You don't have to understand.
Look at me.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.199
No, please, Ms. Karp,
not compulsion, please.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.119
- I beg of you, please!
- I'm not taking your memories away.

54:44.120 --> 54:46.879
Just hiding them for a bit.

54:46.880 --> 54:48.479
Lissa's life is in peril.

54:48.480 --> 54:52.319
You only need to know you have to
get her away from the academy.

54:52.320 --> 54:56.999
Forget everything I've said
until it's time not to forget.

55:02.280 --> 55:05.399
I guess you could say that
it was half-repression

55:05.400 --> 55:08.319
and half-compulsion,
and when you asked me

55:08.320 --> 55:10.279
why we left the academy
in the first place,

55:10.280 --> 55:11.799
a part of me couldn't remember.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.679
I just knew that we had to get out.

55:13.680 --> 55:14.919
Outrageous.

55:14.920 --> 55:17.439
What Headmistress
Kirova means to say

55:17.440 --> 55:20.199
is that it was brave of you
to come forward, Rose.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.399
Well, I'm doing it for Lissa.
She needs help.

55:22.400 --> 55:26.599
But is it really true she
can bring the dead to life?

55:26.600 --> 55:29.919
Dead's dead... but from
the brink of death.

55:29.920 --> 55:34.719
Not since St. Vladimir, and he
never declared a magic, either.

55:34.720 --> 55:37.799
But there is no actual proof
to anything you're saying.

55:37.800 --> 55:40.319
We found no cameras,
and the compulsion alone

55:40.320 --> 55:44.039
can only be done in specific
environments by trained professionals.

55:44.040 --> 55:47.323
Well, Lissa had no problem doing it
to you, right in your own office.

55:47.880 --> 55:50.559
Surely, you had to wonder why you
didn't just throw me out of school.

55:50.560 --> 55:52.239
It's outrageous.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.679
Enough, please.

55:54.680 --> 55:57.559
Ms. Sonya Karp. I want to
see the Day Six footage.

55:57.560 --> 55:59.319
I've had a rough night.

55:59.320 --> 56:00.999
Don't make me crawl through
a ventilator shaft

56:01.000 --> 56:03.719
and lower myself down into the
security center on a wire.

56:03.720 --> 56:07.799
Headmistress, we have no right to keep
Rose in the dark for as long as we have.

56:07.800 --> 56:10.439
All right. All right.

56:10.440 --> 56:13.564
Take her downstairs.
Show her everything.

56:26.760 --> 56:29.159
Show us Karp Day Six,
please. Thank you.

56:33.160 --> 56:35.439
I knew this is what
you were looking for.

56:35.440 --> 56:38.879
Couple months after you left,
Ms. Karp had a complete breakdown.

56:38.880 --> 56:41.399
And did the doctors
find a way to help her?

56:41.400 --> 56:43.648
She found a way to help herself.

56:44.880 --> 56:46.719
Karp was not like the others.

56:46.720 --> 56:50.479
She didn't become Strigoi for
the power or the immortality.

56:50.480 --> 56:53.719
She just... wanted
the pain to go away.

56:53.720 --> 56:57.599
Nobody likes to talk about it,
but the most effective way

56:57.600 --> 57:01.679
for the undeclared to take
away their special anxiety

57:01.680 --> 57:05.851
is for them to take a
life and become Strigoi.

57:06.880 --> 57:09.039
Strigoi have an inner clarity.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.439
No feelings. No worries.

57:11.440 --> 57:14.644
No weakness.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.479
She got away.

57:22.480 --> 57:24.762
We don't know where she is now.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.279
Roza? Roza, calm down.

57:32.280 --> 57:34.159
- I'll protect you.
- Roza?

57:34.160 --> 57:35.519
It's not Karp. It's Lissa.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.839
She's upstairs, and she's...
she's pissed.

57:37.840 --> 57:41.159
Cuts on my arm?
Is that what she said?

57:41.160 --> 57:43.319
And without the use
of a blade, no less.

57:43.320 --> 57:45.359
I know I've been having
trouble declaring a magic,

57:45.360 --> 57:47.919
but that seems a pretty
pointless skill.

57:47.920 --> 57:49.724
Allow me to put your mind at ease.

57:51.760 --> 57:56.159
Rose is a dear friend, but she
has a talent for tall tales.

57:56.160 --> 57:59.319
Kirova's letting herself be compulsed
even after I gave the compulsion speech!

57:59.320 --> 58:01.719
It's classic!
Ever since the accident,

58:01.720 --> 58:03.639
it's like my life has
been on autopilot.

58:03.640 --> 58:06.159
I guess in Ms. Karp's own
spooky way, she was trying

58:06.160 --> 58:08.639
to help me figure it all out,
but who do I have now?

58:08.640 --> 58:10.719
There is another person
who can help you.

58:10.720 --> 58:13.319
He is on our flags,
posters, uniforms

58:13.320 --> 58:14.879
and the statue in the
middle of the school.

58:14.880 --> 58:16.286
St. Vladimir?

58:17.600 --> 58:19.211
OK. I'm on it.

58:24.280 --> 58:27.119
So, is this where the
outcast losers hang out?

58:27.120 --> 58:29.159
- How did you know...?
- Books on St. Vladimir. Now.

58:29.160 --> 58:30.879
Before, I was asking.
This is me telling.

58:30.880 --> 58:33.519
- God, you're annoying.
- I'm right that this could help Lissa.

58:33.520 --> 58:36.919
Yeah. That's what's
so annoying. Come on.

58:36.920 --> 58:38.799
God, what's a girl got to
do to get a definition

58:38.800 --> 58:41.119
- of "shadow-kissed" up in this...
- Check this out.

58:41.120 --> 58:43.079
"Vladimir had mastered
a very rare magic,

58:43.080 --> 58:46.479
and this magic had a name: Spirit."

58:46.480 --> 58:48.399
All this time, Lissa's
been beating herself up

58:48.400 --> 58:49.919
about not being able
to declare a magic.

58:49.920 --> 58:51.479
Oh, my God, if she only knew.

58:51.480 --> 58:53.599
This makes Lissa more special

58:53.600 --> 58:55.639
and valuable than
I ever even imagined.

58:55.640 --> 58:59.199
I guess I should be happy that the bad
guys aren't trying to kill Lissa,

58:59.200 --> 59:03.239
but it kind of just makes things
more sick and disgusting.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.599
What do they want from Lissa?

59:04.600 --> 59:07.719
What is the point of killing her
cat and setting up cameras?

59:07.720 --> 59:10.599
- Who could be that cruel?
- Headmistress Kirova could be.

59:10.600 --> 59:12.239
And Mia likes to film her pranks.

59:12.240 --> 59:13.679
- That...
- I know.

59:13.680 --> 59:15.359
Both a little on the nose, but...

59:15.360 --> 59:17.079
No, maybe they're so obvious
that they're not obvious.

59:17.080 --> 59:18.879
I did see Kirova with
Mia the other night.

59:18.880 --> 59:20.559
OK, my conspiracy theory of choice

59:20.560 --> 59:22.839
is that someone might be
trying to drive Lissa mad,

59:22.840 --> 59:24.839
to take her out of
throne contention.

59:24.840 --> 59:27.079
I mean, we all know Queen
Tatiana has her issues.

59:27.080 --> 59:28.719
All three witches could
be working together.

59:28.720 --> 59:31.199
I like the way your mind works.
Just hold that thought.

59:31.200 --> 59:34.359
"At times, after the expense of
power and in times of trauma,

59:34.360 --> 59:36.879
Vladimir's agony would manifest
directly onto his skin."

59:36.880 --> 59:39.119
So this proves that
Lissa's not a freak.

59:39.120 --> 59:42.039
Sort of. I mean, it shows that
she could be rehabilitated.

59:42.040 --> 59:44.959
Wait. Lissa does something
like that to herself?

59:44.960 --> 59:47.039
- Cuts and scars and...
- Yes.

59:47.040 --> 59:49.959
Christian, she really could have used
your support these past few weeks.

59:49.960 --> 59:52.039
You agreed Lissa
hasn't been herself.

59:52.040 --> 59:53.999
It's her fault we're not together.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.119
God, the female, especially one
who lives off of blood and magic,

59:57.120 --> 59:59.359
is going to have her mood swings.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.039
It is never the girl's fault,
even when it is the girl's fault.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.759
No one ever explained that to you?

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.439
You know, if you weren't so psychotic,
you'd be fun to hang outwith.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.722
Same to you, creep.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.119
Thank you.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.679
OK, bye.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.609
- OK.
- See ya.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.879
What were you doing with Rose?
You were fornicating, weren't you?

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.559
Fornicat... We were reading.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.999
We discovered a magic
called Spirit. You have it.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.199
Ms. Karp had it,
and so did St. Vladimir.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.079
- He used to cut himself, too.
- Rose told you that?

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.439
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Look, stop it, Lissa.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.759
We're trying to help you.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.799
I know now if you don't
have any family,

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.159
you need as many friends
as you possibly...

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.603
I don't need friends or
family or pets or...

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.879
I hate you!

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.685
You liar.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.879
- Lissa, listen...
- Don't "Lissa, listen" me.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.639
- You've ruined my life.
- Oh, bite me.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.399
- You wish, blood whore.
- Wow.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.879
OK, Lissa, I need
you to understand.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.199
We can learn how St.
Vladimir used Spirit...

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.759
- Did you kill my cat?
- Hey,

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.839
Oscar and I's relationship
was on the mend.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.839
Lissa, this is important.
Ms. Karp turned herself Strigoi.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.079
She didn't do it to become evil.
She did it to take away from

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.639
the scratching and
the shaking. I mean...

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.919
which future do you want, a sick
and soulless one like Karp's

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.439
or an epic one like Vladimir's?

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.639
Stop talking to me about
the past and the future,

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.639
because I only care
about the present.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.879
You know, if you have to choose one,
pick the one that's happening right now.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.119
I am Princess Vasilisa Dragomir.
I'm the last of the Dragomir line.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.039
If they see I'm weak,
they'll attack.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.759
This isn't about a "they" anymore.
This is about you! This is...

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.959
You're awake, finally.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.639
The princess has been going
through feeders all morning.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.159
How are you?

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.999
I don't know. You tell me.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.519
I'm afraid to even look.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.839
I can move it,
that's a good sign, right?

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.963
Rose, I don't know how
to say this, but...

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.279
you are not injured.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.319
That's easy for you
to say, comrade.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.091
I heard the crack.
I saw the bone...

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.799
Sorry to interrupt.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.079
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.930
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.159
So, I saw Aaron go by.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.799
- I kicked him to the curb.
- Mmm.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.879
When I saw your leg, I got
everything out of my system.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.159
- Everything.
- Thanks for that, by the way.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.479
Ugh.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.959
I'm so glad you're both alive and
not at each other's throats.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.639
This whole matter of Spirit
has taken us by surprise.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.119
Until the advisers
arrive from Romania,

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.439
we'll be sequestering
you both into a bunker,

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.519
away from any excitement.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.759
No classes, and obviously
you will not be attending

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.119
- the Equinox Dance tonight.
- Oh, nonsense.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.999
Please, you have to come.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.999
I'm gonna go with the headmistress
on this one, Prince Dashkov.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.359
Besides, we're all forgetting
the most important thing.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.799
- We have nothing to wear.
- There the gods have smiled upon us.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.799
Today is an overcast day,

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.599
and I have engineered a
little shopping expedition.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.599
Please? You know how
much I need your help.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.371
And plus, when has shopping
ever not cheered you up, Lissa?

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.519
Where is Rose?

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.688
OK.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.279
What was that about?

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.759
It's just a little something Dimitri and
I do to keep each other on our toes.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.639
Wow, that was weak. How long
have you been in crush with him?

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.879
I am... very sure that I don't
know what you're talking about.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.719
- So, do I get a silver stake?
- That would be a... no.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.199
But remember, today you are
not just Lissa's friend.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.084
Spiridon.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.279
Ain't likely any Strigoi
is gonna make a play

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.959
in a public place
in broad daylight,

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.159
but if Dimitri ain't
giving you a stake, missy,

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.159
you should have one
of these bad boys.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.439
'Causes a blinding flash of
UV light. Buy you some time.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.087
Well, at least someone
thinks I'm worth a weapon.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.039
So, my superpower turned out
to also be my Kryptonite.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.439
Wow, Your Highness with the
pop culture reference.

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.319
You know, I...

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.879
I confused power with popularity.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.328
Ever wonder what it'd be
like to be like that?

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.799
It's not our destiny.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.519
Destiny? I hate that word.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.679
You know, "royal responsibility,"

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.039
"the Moroi come first,"
it's all so twisted.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.999
It's not twisted. I'm your Dhampir
and you're my Moroi. Done.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.479
Some days we're kooky teenagers,

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.439
and other days I'm risking
my neck to protect you

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.999
from an ancient race of
predatory vampires...

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.599
or whoever else, and that's life.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.239
At least until they come up
with a better word for it.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.999
Somebody looks tense. Free massage?

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.159
I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry, OK?

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.930
Run.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:43.079
Ms. Karp, I understand all that,
but Mia and my brother...

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.999
don't think so.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.359
Andre was generous and
funny and amazing,

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.799
but... he could kind
of be a player.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.119
Lissa, don't look like you don't
know what I'm talking about,

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.799
'cause I can feel you, OK?

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.839
You know, I hate having a
best friend I can't lie to.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.759
Do you really think
Mini-Mia's behind everything?

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.999
No, not exactly.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.319
But I think we'll find out tonight.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.679
Tomorrow you're getting sequestered
away by Spirit advisers,

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.479
so the dance is the last chance
for anybody to try to get to you.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.319
Look, if you could put a pin in all
that, we have more vital matters.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.919
Finding you a dress.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.599
I can go into my trust fund.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.719
I could not possibly accept that.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.199
That's your dress. That's the
dress you were born to wear.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.880
Lissa, we have more important
things to do than sh...

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.239
That is my dress.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.439
Thank you, sir, and if you
could just sign here?

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.039
And that is your necklace.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.890
That is my necklace.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.199
That's not your necklace.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.811
So not my necklace.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.999
Did you take my lip gloss?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.759
Corpse Number Five? Like I'd
wear your pale-ass lip gloss.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.919
No way.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.479
Natalie, you look gorgeous.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:51.607
Rose... this is for you,
from my father.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.919
That's my necklace.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.090
Daddy saw you looking at it. Here.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.439
- How does it look?
- Beautiful.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.119
All right, ladies.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.959
I don't know what's
gonna happen tonight.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.119
At this point, I can't remember
who loves us and who hates us...

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.159
but I do know that we are
going to own this dance.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.044
Let's make tonight our bitch.

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.439
Not much of a reaction
from your boyfriend.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.439
He's not my boyfriend, but...
grading on the Dimitri curve,

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.479
a huge reaction...
mammoth, gargantuan.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.159
Come here.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.519
Genuinely un-small.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.085
Christian Ozera.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.118
At a school dance.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.038
After this week, I thought I'd
lost the ability to be surprised.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.439
I'm sorry about that
kiss the other day.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:27.198
What about the one right now?

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.924
- Rose.
- Hey, what's up?

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:49.399
- OK.
- Rose, you look...

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:51.919
No, you don't get to stare at her.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.999
I took it upon myself to talk to
these royal pains in the butt.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.359
Hmm.

01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:59.919
Don't you have something to say?

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.439
- We're sorry.
- Hmm.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:03.479
We didn't do anything to
you that we said we did.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:06.118
You're telling something that never
happened actually never happened?

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.279
Thanks.

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:09.118
Mia let us have sex with
her if we obeyed her.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.279
I tagged the note at the church
and air-blasted the memorial.

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.999
What did you think of
the scary screen saver?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.879
We actually put a lot
of work into that.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.439
And the bloody one just happened.

01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:22.198
We thought it'd be fun to all
hook up in the princess's room,

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.479
and things got out
of hand, literally.

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:27.359
It's called blood splash.
It's a new Moroi fad,

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:30.078
<i>where when things get hot and sticky,
you fang open your wrist and spray.</i>

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.198
Ew! Stop. I nap on that couch.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.879
OK, what about the cat?

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.158
We thought it was a fox.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.158
Hurting animals...
that's disgusting.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.839
Said the creepy blood splasher.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.609
Please, Rose, don't kick my ass.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.041
Go dance with Natalie.

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.363
Go, now.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.886
Oh, Jesse.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.329
- Who's the man?
- You are so the man.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.845
Break the case wide open and
I still only get the cheek.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.039
Ouch.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.239
Ever feel like you're
being watched?

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.879
Can we pretend the past
month never happened?

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.039
Why were you in the hospital?
Pregnant?

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.999
- I guess not.
- Herpes?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.919
Maybe your baby has herpes.
I don't care if it's true. I'll tell...

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.919
- Go away, Mia.
- Why are you Dragomirs such drags?

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.679
First Andre, then you steal Aaron
from me and don't even keep him.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.879
- I don't need this.
- I vow to take down the entire...

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.279
I'll fire-magic you into ash.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.199
I'll just water-magic
myself before you can...

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.599
Gosh, you two are a riot.
Allow me, Mr. Ozera.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.119
Rose, I hear you and the
princess are friends again.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.799
Too bad... could have
made a great team.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.239
Oh, nice wrist corsage, Splashy.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.559
Your sex slaves told me
everything, and poor Aaron

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.919
had no idea what a
sociopath you really are.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.599
- I'll bet you did off Lissa's cat.
- Oscar? I gave him treats.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.479
I would never hurt a kitty.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.519
Oh, my God, you poor little...

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.919
All this time, me thinking
that you're a villain

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.159
when you're really just...

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.999
you're just an insecure little girl
in desperate need of attention.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.599
Everyone saw that I tried to
take the high road there.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.679
- Rose.
- Sort of.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.839
If Mia didn't do it, that means there's
a bigger threat still out there.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.159
- Hathaway, you're out of here.
- Lissa's run off. I didn't see where.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.199
Oh, God, if only there was a secret place
that she went to when she was sad.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.289
- Right.
- Genius.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.439
OK, OK.

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.051
OK.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.159
Please, please, please, please.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.399
- Christian.
- We need to get you somewhere safe.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.159
- Just a little longer in the moonlight.
- No, no.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.328
Our moonlight.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.599
OK, now we need to go.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.959
Lissa.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.839
Headmistress Kirova,
we need to get Dimitri.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.039
- The princess is in trouble.
- She's not the only one.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.439
- You don't understand.
- I do understand, Rose.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.759
I understand more
than you'll ever...

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.239
I could have been a model.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:18.279
A man in Milan gave me
his card when I was 16.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.726
Dimitri? Dimitri, open up.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.519
Dimitri, something has happened.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.768
Rose, what's wrong?

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.719
What's right?

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.439
Sweet sassy molassey.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.239
What do you want, Rose?

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.522
Some of that.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.366
This is insane.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.439
What are we doing?

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.404
Everything.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.719
I love your dress.

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.285
Let's burn it.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.119
Love charms... hypnotic,
dangerous, put over jewelry...

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.527
Forget about it. Lissa's been
kidnapped. We have to hurry.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.999
Report from the gate.
Nothing's come in or out.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.359
They're still on academy ground...
Have you cleared this with Kirova?

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.199
Better to beg forgiveness
than ask permission.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.687
Yeah, and I put a
sedative in her ass.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.639
Let me concentrate.
You've got to be kidding me.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.526
- What is it?
- Nothing. Hold on. OK.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.239
<i>He's coming in.</i>

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.119
Check the blindfold.
No compulsion tonight.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.079
I can't make out anything
through the blindfold,

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.199
but I know that voice.
It's... that guardian.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.079
<i>- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?</i>

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.599
"Oh, no," who. The bad
guy's Victor Dashkov.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.359
Welcome, Vasilisa.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.279
How was the dance?

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.679
It's officially tomorrow,
and, as promised,

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.239
we have much to talk about.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.519
Forgive me if I don't
make eye contact.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.199
- I've seen you in action.
- Why are you doing this?

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:33.119
My dear, the simple truth is,
I need you to heal me.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.959
Testing you with the
animals was misguided,

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.359
but earth-magicking the cement
and shattering Rose's ankle

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.719
was supremely clarifying.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.839
You're forgetting something.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.519
My bond with Rose is
practically a psychic GPS.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.199
Ah, yes, but the necklace
gift that I gave to Rose

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.199
is bathed in a very
expensive love charm,

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.639
and she is a little too preoccupied
to be of much use to you.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.079
That's what you think, mother...
Victor wants her to heal him.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.839
You were my family's
most cherished friend.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.119
Why didn't you just ask me?

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:11.959
How touching...
genuinely, my darling,

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.999
but a chronic disease
like my Sandovsky's needs

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.759
continual healings, and then
there is the other matter.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.479
The physical toll on me.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.439
Yes, Spirit users take their
power from their own essence.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.999
To heal another requires
giving part of oneself,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.319
and it can destroy one over time.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.439
You want me to give
up my life for yours.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.319
Basically. But, you see, my dear,

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.319
I am much more important than you,

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.759
and the Moroi need a strong
leader, but my disease means

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.919
that I cannot occupy my
rightful place upon the throne.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.239
But you shouldn't bother
your pretty little head

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.959
about all this royal intrigue.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.759
Guess what, Victor.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.319
The spirit in this pretty little
head isn't going to heal you.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.199
- You can't make me.
- Bring in Kenneth.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.119
Do you know somebody named Kenneth?

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.399
Your compulsion won't
work on Kenneth.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:11.119
He's blind, but he's one of the
Moroi's most ingenious air users.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.319
- Shall we begin? Heal me.
- Go to hell.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.839
You're up, Kenneth.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.999
Rose?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.929
Don't stop. They're torturing her.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.767
Heal me.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.279
Now he's...

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.679
Ah, Lissa.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.325
Heal me.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.607
My...

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.729
this really worked out.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.321
Take the girl upstairs
till departure.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.359
Rose, stay here. It's too dangerous,
you'll just get in the way.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.079
- But...
- Do I really need to remind you

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.279
the last time I said
"stay in the car"

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.439
and was disobeyed?

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.120
No, I totally understand.
Good luck.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.519
- You're not really staying, are you?
- What do you think?

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.639
But what did Dimitri mean by
"last time I said 'stay in the car" '?

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.479
He was talking about another
girl from another time.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.205
She was a novice.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.679
I'm a guardian.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.848
Let's roll, fire magic.
I need a seeing-eye dog.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.879
Take my arm.
The princess is upstairs.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.446
No, no, not this way.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.399
- Rose.
- Keep going.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.559
- It's right up there.
- Rose!

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.921
What?!

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.839
Spiridon, send for the girl.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.280
We're ready now.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.084
I believe you can fly.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.399
Feel free to chime in at any
time with some fire magic.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.639
Maybe a ring of flame
around the knob?

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.959
I've never really worked outside
a classroom setting before.

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.799
Forget it, she's gone.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.879
Stop trying to save yourself, Liss.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.206
Stupid one-way bond.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.159
Psi-bounds.

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.679
Expensive to breed,
difficult to train,

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.639
but there is no denying the
brilliance of the psi-hounds.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.799
They will stalk the
princess, maneuver her,

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.599
but they won't attack
unless I say the word.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:46.519
I presume you can deal with that?

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.959
They say Dimitri is a god.

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.687
Well, I'm an atheist...
an atheist with a big gun.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.759
That's it? Seriously?

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.519
I've waited for this moment.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:41.079
Do you know what it's like to always be
referred to as the second best guardian?

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.359
No.

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.124
Are you OK?

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.839
- Did you see what Victor did?
- I know. What an asshole.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.919
I hate to interrupt, but unless
either of you can fly a chopper,

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.679
maybe we should get going.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.919
Lissa, get back.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.519
Rose, be a dear and step
away from the princess.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:05.079
I don't want to accidentally
shoot her when I'm shooting you.

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.039
You heard him, he won't shoot me.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.399
- I am your guardian.
- No, Rose, you can't do this.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.968
Lissa, don't you dare fight. Lissa.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.759
- You're worse than a Strigoi.
- Christian!

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:21.799
Do you know what I like
most about the psi-hounds?

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:25.599
They're wonderful at tracking.
They're even better at killing.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.199
Attack!

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:31.679
No.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:52.526
Now, that's some
freaking fire magic.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.599
Rose, I need to save
him, but I can't.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.559
Victor took everything,
all my energy.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.285
Power up, Princess.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.159
<i>This has been a night that St.
Vladimir's will never forget.</i>

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.959
<i>We have extra guardians manning the
academy perimeter. Nothing can get in.</i>

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:43.439
Victor Dashkov will be confined
to a holding cell downstairs

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:46.999
until he can be transferred to the
Royal Court Prison to await trial.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.199
How's Natalie? She worshipped her
father. She must be devastated.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.879
The other members of the Dashkov
family are removing her from school.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.599
For the best.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:59.319
Uh-oh, Rose. This came for you.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.519
Oh, great.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.919
Uh, Dimitri, one last thing...

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:08.759
The time gap after Rose so
dramatically burst out of my office...

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.439
It should all be explained
in the other file.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.879
A Nobu charm was put on a
necklace Rose had been wearing.

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:17.159
The spell caused Rose to attack
me and me to attack her.

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.999
I disengaged the necklace before
critical... violence could occur.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.043
Mmm.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.159
Hey, we should probably talk
about what happened earlier.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.999
I just want you to know I
would never use the words

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.119
"sweet sassy molassey"
unless under the influence.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.399
It is not a matter of
amusement or discussion.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.399
- It was horrific.
- Horrific...

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.319
isn't really the first
adjective that comes to mind.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.359
Don't make light of this.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.879
It's one thing if I were
36 and you were 28,

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.839
or me 28 and you 20.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.959
That's a lot of math for
someone who's not interested.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.599
Your life is about
homework, dances, parties.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.039
How can you say that
after what happened?

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.439
It's what it should be about.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.359
I'm not interested
in you in that way.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.279
- OK.
- It was...

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.039
just a spell.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.439
- Let it go.
- Got it.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.599
- Rose?
- Yeah?

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.759
You're still here?

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.359
I'm not sure how I feel about this,

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.239
but Victor has requested
a moment of your time.

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.359
Yeah, no, that's not gonna happen.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.040
He said something about you
being "shadow-kissed"?

01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:17.039
She's not going. That's final.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.049
Don't tell me what to do.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.199
You look good, Vic.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.599
Which is ironic, considering it
means more time rotting in jail.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.759
Don't take this the
wrong way, Rose, but...

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.279
I probably should have killed you.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.439
There's a compliment
in there somewhere.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.919
I spent a lot of
money on that charm.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.599
It didn't quite work
out the way I wanted.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.079
Mmm. It worked out well enough.

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.119
Caused a man with no interest in
me to burn off my dress, so...

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.359
You're so tough, so one-of-a-kind.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.159
But you're still a girl.
All this has happened,

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.039
and what you want to know is,
"Does Dimitri really like me?"

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.199
It's a powerful charm, Rose,
but it's not that powerful.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:13.009
There has to be a degree of affection
and attraction already in place.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:14.999
Happy?

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.759
- Shadow-kissed?
- Ah, yes. I owe you that.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.079
You see, I didn't begin
to track Vasilisa

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.399
with some silly old raven.

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.284
My eye was on her long before.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.849
<i>I've seen the accident report.</i>

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.639
<i>And there's absolutely no way that
either of you should have survived.</i>

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.119
<i>The accident was what woke
her spirit in the first place.</i>

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:38.679
<i>The fear of seeing you
dead made it burst out,</i>

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.282
<i>allowing her to heal,
made you form your bond.</i>

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.439
Rose...

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.563
you've been kissed by shadows.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.599
You've crossed over into death,

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:54.079
into the other side, and returned.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.839
Don't you think that leaves a
mark on the soul... somewhere?

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.519
That's why you're not afraid
to show your feelings, Rose,

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.839
your passion, your anger.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:06.964
That's what makes
you remarkable. Yes.

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.719
But it's ironic... considering.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.039
Considering what?

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.319
Considering I'll have to kill you.

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.399
Natalie. You made your own
daughter turn Strigoi?

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.559
And how do you think I can
circumvent the outside security?

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.959
I'd do anything for my daddy.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.319
All that training, and yet,
I'm going to obliterate you.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.479
You see, Natalie was not the
innocent you thought she was.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.919
In fact, she was the one who
provided me with the intel

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.639
regarding you,
Dimitri and Vasilisa.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.639
The cat was my idea.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.879
Daddy wanted to do another fox.

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.199
Father, look.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.079
Rose does choke before Strigoi.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.999
I don't understand.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.399
To become a Strigoi,
don't you have to...

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.599
Yes. I chose Ray to be my first.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.679
<i>Killing him was a lot more fun</i>

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.999
<i>than losing my virginity
to him would've been.</i>

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.919
And with a lot more blood.

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.399
Too soon?

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.519
Hey, Victor?

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.599
Aren't you afraid your
new Strigoi daughter

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.719
won't be able to resist
your Moroi veins?

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.127
Don't be ludicrous.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.919
I'm gonna wait outside, Natalie.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.326
Finish her off.

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.726
You don't know what high school
is like for a loser like me.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:46.450
I was so scared all the time...

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.479
so weak, so sad, so lame.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.399
Now my eyesight is perfect,

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.119
my skin is clear,
and so is my mind.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.599
I may be dead, but I have
never felt so alive.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.439
How awesome for you. Say cheese.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.039
Rose?

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.599
Oh.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.199
Maybe I won't kill you.

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:32.799
Maybe I'll make you just like me.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:37.359
That way, we can be
friends forever and ever.

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.847
BFF!

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.040
Who's choking now?

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.399
Roza, Roza.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.489
Oh, my Roza.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.719
Lissa, you're gonna
want to see this.

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:41.759
I don't believe my eyes. You got him
wearing a color other than black.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.359
Baby steps.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.599
Oh, Rose, wait.

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:46.519
There's so much to read here.

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:48.559
Apparently, Vladimir and Anna
almost drowned in this flood,

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:51.919
but he saved them from certain
death, and listen to this.

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:55.519
"It took many years for Vladimir to
master the power of his Spirit."

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.439
"Despite his sufferings
and delusions,"

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.039
"he never contemplated
the way of the Strigoi,"

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.239
"because he always
had the strength"

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:05.319
"of his shadow-kissed guardian,
Anna, to see him through."

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:08.399
Similarities. Weird.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.159
Well, Christian, for us, weird...

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.727
Doesn't begin to cover it.

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.559
Do I have to?

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:16.921
It's time.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.250
God, not her. Not now.

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:30.159
And once again, this grotesque
maelstrom of indecency

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:33.479
seems centered on one
royal individual.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.399
- Where's Vasilisa Drag...
- Thank you, Your Majesty,

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.879
for allowing me to clear the air.

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:41.039
I finally declared a magic,
and it's called Spirit.

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.559
It may take years to
get a handle on it,

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.159
but I have a bunch of wise
men in robes to help me out.

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:49.559
And yes, that was not a mirage
you saw on the dance floor.

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:53.399
My boyfriend is Christian Ozera,
and his parents were Strigoi.

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.399
Get over it. He has.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.679
I'm not quite sure
what you think...

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.559
Shh! Not now, dear.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.879
Blood. Blood is what
connects us all.

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.719
Blood is sustenance.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.279
Blood is family.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:13.439
Blood is pain, and blood is death,

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.599
be it the fang of the Strigoi

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:20.010
or a drunk driver on the
wrong side of the road.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.959
Blood is many things,

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:25.439
and sometimes it gets
so crazy and confusing

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:28.679
that you need a best friend
to tell you, "it's OK."

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:33.599
"It's all life, at least until they come
up with a better word for it."

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:36.319
Unfortunately, you can't
all have a Rose Hathaway.

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.999
I'm very lucky that she's mine,

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.439
but if you don't have a soul mate,
by Vlad, the least you deserve

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:48.599
is kindness and dignity and something
more original than gossip,

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:51.999
snobbiness, slut-shaming
and bullying.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.479
Let's prove that Moroi
blood is worth protecting.

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:58.159
What do you say, everyone?

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.279
No more bad blood.

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.239
So, that's Natalie, huh?

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:22.559
Looks... fresh.

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.199
I'm sorry.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.519
I had to.

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.679
I'm sorry.

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.039
- I hesitated.
- Rose...

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.879
you're so brave and
strong and bold.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:35.926
Sadly, you'll have many other
opportunities to kill Strigoi.

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.446
You lied about your
feelings for me.

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.129
Yes. I did.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.639
Why would you do that?

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.759
It's more than my age and
my position at the academy.

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.079
Our allegiance is to the Moroi.

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.039
If I let myself love,

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.891
I wouldn't throw myself
in front of the princess.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.362
I would throw myself
in front of you.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:11.079
It's funny.

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.559
Your reasons for not
loving me just...

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.411
make me love you more.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:24.407
I want you to kiss me without a
magic charm forcing you to do it.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:26.559
That's not a great idea.

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.285
Please.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.488
Everyone's at the banquet. Just...

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.969
one last kiss.

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.039
Yes! Yes, yes!

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.359
Yes! Are you not entertained?!

01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.159
<i>My name is Rose Hathaway,</i>

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.679
<i>and I'm not your
normal teenage girl,</i>

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.119
<i>but I guess, is there
really such a thing?</i>

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.239
<i>Every life has rules, traditions,
friends and enemies,</i>

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.359
<i>sheer terror and incredible joy,</i>

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.799
<i>but I've learned...</i>

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.606
Whoa! Watch where you're
going there, bird.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.679
Are you kidding me?

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:20.239
It's you, isn't it?

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.399
Come...

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.119
my shadow-kissed soul mate.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.639
Well, same to you, buddy!

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.491
Now!

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.090
Soon.
