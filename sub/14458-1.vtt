Co-Producer Danny PARK
Master told me
to be courteous.

01:35.303 --> 01:38.847
There's something
we need to sort out.

01:38.890 --> 01:39.681
Sort out?

01:40.141 --> 01:42.101
The issue of how you should
address the master.

01:43.311 --> 01:47.689
Don't worry.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.109
I may be of a higher class but

01:50.610 --> 01:52.986
I wouldn't use the plain
form with Mr. YI.

01:55.448 --> 01:59.201
But nonetheless
I want you to know

01:59.202 --> 02:03.872
my master's plainly spoken.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.667
I see.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.216

Written and Directed
by KIM Dae-woo

02:32.318 --> 02:35.654
I made you come all this way
because I want this soup.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.949
- Sorry.
- Not at all.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.036
After you try it,

02:43.079 --> 02:44.288
you'll say
it's worth the trip.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.497
Yes, sir.

02:53.089 --> 02:56.508
I asked you to come

02:59.637 --> 03:05.267
because I'm not sure I'd make
a good subject for a novel

03:07.896 --> 03:09.479
What are you saying?

03:09.898 --> 03:12.399
I was so excited
I couldn't sleep last night

03:13.610 --> 03:16.486
You're the town's most
glamorous gangster...

03:19.991 --> 03:21.074
Me and my mouth.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.076
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that

03:23.077 --> 03:24.578
You're right,
I am a gangster

03:27.332 --> 03:28.498
And

03:31.836 --> 03:34.087
you're at the top
ofthe beach reading heap

03:34.631 --> 03:35.714
Beach reading?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.969
I'm not sure if I'm the best

03:41.596 --> 03:45.849
Anyway,
thanks for choosing me

03:47.227 --> 03:49.061
Any writer

03:51.439 --> 03:54.316
would want to write
about you

04:02.242 --> 04:06.328
What did you do before?

04:07.830 --> 04:11.959
I used to be a servant.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.295
A servant!

04:17.340 --> 04:20.676
I went from here to there
until I was 30

04:22.178 --> 04:25.764
and I became
an aristocrat's servant.

04:27.433 --> 04:34.147
I shared a room
with a houseguest, Mr. MA.

04:41.197 --> 04:44.783
You're the new maid?

04:45.702 --> 04:48.287
Enjoying your life here?

04:49.706 --> 04:50.872
Yes, why do you ask?

04:52.500 --> 04:54.501
That's not the way.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.504
We should look each other
in the eye when we talk.

05:03.720 --> 05:08.598
People told me to be careful
when you're around.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.520
All gossip and rumors.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.313
It's hot!

05:15.440 --> 05:16.606
How silly!

05:17.900 --> 05:20.944
This is fun.
Can I come again?

05:21.696 --> 05:24.865
Sorry? Yes...

05:26.701 --> 05:28.160
Dear me!

05:36.210 --> 05:39.504
She was talking to me but
her eyes were on you.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.966
Sorry? Oh...

05:46.220 --> 05:47.679
It's hot!

05:49.640 --> 05:50.766
What are you doing?

05:53.811 --> 05:55.145
So hot!

06:04.197 --> 06:11.161
So, what's Mong like?

06:12.288 --> 06:14.498
It's only been a few days

06:14.999 --> 06:16.083
so I don't know.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.794
He's nice to me.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.171
Nice?

06:21.214 --> 06:24.966
He's given me clothes.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.678
Mong...

06:29.430 --> 06:32.391
I've known him
since he was a kid

06:34.268 --> 06:36.478
but still can't
figure him out.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.781
It wasn't a grand job
but I wanted to do my best.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.077
It must be tough
waiting around for me.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.788
Not at all, master.

06:58.084 --> 07:03.672
Then, I saw her.

07:22.817 --> 07:28.697
The scent offlowers
is all around

07:28.739 --> 07:34.661
From this peak to
that peak All around

07:39.709 --> 07:44.671
Butterflies
follow the scent

07:44.714 --> 07:48.800
Do you work here?

07:49.719 --> 07:50.677
Yeah,

07:52.221 --> 07:55.515
why do you ask?

07:56.392 --> 07:57.684
Who is she?

07:59.020 --> 08:03.690
She's the owner's daughter,

08:03.691 --> 08:05.233
Her name's Chun-hyang.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.236
I'm Hyang-dan.

08:08.279 --> 08:12.574
Butterfly,
drunk by the scent,

08:12.617 --> 08:18.163
don't sit on the petals

08:18.206 --> 08:29.257
For scented flowers
uphold their fidelity

08:34.388 --> 08:45.774
Don't come sit
on my petals

09:01.541 --> 09:03.083
Bang-ja!

09:06.212 --> 09:10.173
Go arrange a meeting.
Hurry!

09:33.823 --> 09:36.700
You can't follow me in here!

09:38.202 --> 09:44.958
My master wants a word
with you.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.459
Who's your master?

09:47.628 --> 09:49.671
He's the one that
got up earlier.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.465
The most handsome guy there.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.092
Handsome?

09:54.635 --> 09:56.803
Stop talking rubbish
and get out!

09:56.804 --> 09:58.471
You could just have a word
with him.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.806
I was wondering

10:00.808 --> 10:04.352
where you'd gone.
What are you doing here?

10:05.021 --> 10:06.980
I was telling her
about you, master.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.451
Such a grave indiscretion.

10:20.369 --> 10:23.455
I was a bit scared
but it's alright.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.374
You didn't have to hit him.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.088
I've been too kind to him.

10:36.218 --> 10:40.263
I'd like to invite you to tea
to apologize properly.

10:41.849 --> 10:45.393
What are you doing?

10:45.645 --> 10:51.358
Chun-hyang, I'm dying
waiting for you.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.068
I said no.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.781
But you sang
for the aristocrats.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.991
You have to play fair.

10:59.992 --> 11:00.992
Hey, you!

11:02.286 --> 11:06.456
I don't know what it's about

11:07.291 --> 11:08.792
but the lady said 'no.'

11:16.425 --> 11:19.469
Young master,
let me greet you.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.555
I'm Gwang of Tavern Street.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.683
Nice to meet you.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.440
Looks like you're
all fired up.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.194
But time to go home now.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.278
Don't do that...

11:37.321 --> 11:39.072
You can't order me around.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.784
You cant order me around

11:42.827 --> 11:49.791
You're enraging this lowly
nothing of a guy.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.085
Go home, now!

11:59.218 --> 12:00.343
Who the hell are you?

12:00.386 --> 12:03.638
I'm his servant.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.640
You servant!

12:07.727 --> 12:09.811
I'm alright, stand back.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.457
Where are you?

12:30.916 --> 12:31.958
Boss

12:50.019 --> 12:54.105
Chun-hyang...

12:55.691 --> 12:58.985
That was a big mistake.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.197
You shouldn't have done that.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.366
What was I supposed to do?

13:06.410 --> 13:10.455
You robbed Mong the chance

13:10.998 --> 13:12.540
to show off.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.002
And he hit you.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.879
Don't you have any pride?

13:20.216 --> 13:22.175
But I'm his servant.

13:28.682 --> 13:29.808
Was that the only reason?

13:31.936 --> 13:36.648
I guess.
This is making me angry.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.069
What shall I do?

13:41.111 --> 13:45.073
Of course, you'll have to
get her word on this.

13:45.908 --> 13:46.741
What?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.452
How can I do that?

13:51.205 --> 13:54.666
Let's deal
with Hyang-dan first.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.292
Sorry?

13:59.505 --> 14:02.090
I never teach
this to anyone. Never.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.758
Oh, please.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.762
You're in a tight spot
so I want to help.

14:08.430 --> 14:13.184
Tell her what needs
to be done.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.979
Walk back and forth
in front of her.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.648
That'll get her confused
and irritated.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.734
Don't take any notice
and focus on

14:21.777 --> 14:24.279
what you need to say
and then

14:24.321 --> 14:26.573
Then, just casually like this

14:30.953 --> 14:33.580
Grab hold of her right here.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.631
What? Grab her there?

14:43.674 --> 14:49.262
Not too fast, not too slow.
Like this.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.645
She's not going to
let me do that!

14:58.230 --> 14:59.272
She'll get away.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.567
Get away?

15:03.027 --> 15:04.485
Of course.

15:06.113 --> 15:10.992
Try again and see
if you can get away.

15:11.035 --> 15:14.495
You're walking
and she's talking.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.788
And grab!

15:17.917 --> 15:23.004
You can't get away.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.676
He's a weird servant.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.764
Other servants
don't get involved.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.265
Very brave!

15:35.225 --> 15:39.395
What if his master's
lost his nerve?

15:41.941 --> 15:45.485
He's caught the bait.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.697
He'll come back.
You'll see.

15:57.289 --> 16:02.001
A servant has come
from Lord YI's.

16:12.054 --> 16:16.849
Who told you to
make a decision?

16:17.309 --> 16:19.185
Just pass on the message.

16:21.814 --> 16:26.067
He wants to see her tomorrow

16:26.610 --> 16:28.486
by the waterfall.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.572
My mistress doesn't
go out with men.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.199
She's not like that.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.662
I don't care what she's like.
Just pass on the message.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.872
There's no point
in passing it on.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.583
You're so stubborn!

16:49.633 --> 16:53.886
What a lovely view.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.350
Why this sudden talk
ofthe view?

16:59.393 --> 17:00.351
Grab!

17:06.775 --> 17:13.114
Let's try to get along,
shall we?

17:19.121 --> 17:20.371
What did he say?

17:23.333 --> 17:26.294
His master wants to meet her

17:26.920 --> 17:27.879
And then?

17:29.548 --> 17:31.382
Answer me.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.385
So I said 'yes'.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.555
What?

17:39.141 --> 17:40.683
What was I supposed to do?

17:46.982 --> 17:49.484
What do nobles talk
about on a date?

17:51.612 --> 17:54.197
Maybe the same things we do.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.870
Aren't they hungry,
smelling this?

18:07.127 --> 18:08.753
They're not like us.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.381
They hide their feelings.

18:13.425 --> 18:17.762
Not shoving it down the throat
even if you're starving

18:19.306 --> 18:20.765
That's what being
an aristocrat is about.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.101
You're a bit
like one yourself.

18:27.231 --> 18:31.692
Stop talking
and focus on the meat.

18:35.739 --> 18:39.575
You're a good cook.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.747
What an odd thing
for a guy to be good at.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.959
You seemed so strong
at the fight the other day

18:50.629 --> 18:53.673
but now your hands
seem so gentle.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.968
Come to think of it,

18:57.719 --> 18:59.887
you are really good
with the barbecue.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.058
Did you learn this
from Mr. MA?

19:08.147 --> 19:11.649
Who's Mr. MA?

19:13.235 --> 19:18.030
A lecherous houseguest.

19:19.074 --> 19:22.952
He taught Bang-ja
some naughty

19:22.995 --> 19:24.787
skills that he used on her.

19:26.915 --> 19:32.211
I scolded him for that.

19:35.340 --> 19:39.385
I see...

19:56.069 --> 19:57.486
Isn't it hot?

19:58.697 --> 20:00.198
I learnt to take the heat
from Mr. MA.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.409
I put you into a mood,
you silly boy.

20:04.411 --> 20:09.415
Oh, no! Are you okay?

20:10.709 --> 20:12.210
Are you okay?

20:12.252 --> 20:14.503
What happened?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.214
Stay still.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.466
You've sprained your ankle.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.384
Stay still.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.475
Oh, dear!
Let her rest her ankle.

20:27.517 --> 20:28.976
Be quiet, you!

20:30.103 --> 20:33.981
Let her rest her foot.

20:34.524 --> 20:35.858
Fortunately,
It's not so swollen.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.406
Is there a stone
to put it up on?

20:42.449 --> 20:46.702
- Oh, Mistress...!
- Bang-ja, come on!

21:19.111 --> 21:20.152
One moment

21:43.719 --> 21:46.178
Your master is weird.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.056
He wants me to be
carried by a servant.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.892
I know.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.647
My clothes are damp
from your wet clothes.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.944
You can walk if you want.

22:03.697 --> 22:07.074
Why are you using
such plain language?

22:09.536 --> 22:11.162
You're not a noble.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.249
I show you respect
when my master is there

22:16.001 --> 22:18.169
but I'm older than yo

22:22.632 --> 22:23.966
Am I heavy?

22:24.009 --> 22:26.802
As light as a feather.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.681
You're good at everything.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.059
Like what?

22:34.519 --> 22:40.483
Fighting, swimming
and barbecuing meat.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.153
You never got the chance
to try the meat.

22:44.613 --> 22:48.407
I didn't need to.
I could tell from the smell.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.788
Must have been
a lovelyjourney.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.877
It's snowing.

23:23.443 --> 23:27.279
You run a rice shop?

23:30.200 --> 23:34.078
It's not my main line ofwork.

23:36.790 --> 23:42.336
Times are tough and
this is no exception.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.673
We're just getting by.

23:45.715 --> 23:50.177
Sorry for interrupting but,

23:50.637 --> 23:54.974
if I were the master,
I'd have carried her myself.

23:57.811 --> 24:01.063
That's the manly thing to do

24:01.189 --> 24:06.068
even if you collapse halfway.

24:09.823 --> 24:10.865
Right?

24:12.534 --> 24:16.662
You don't know anything.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.499
It's called
playing hard to get.

24:22.711 --> 24:26.088
She expected me to carry her
but I didn't.

24:26.798 --> 24:32.678
She gets confused
and falls for me hard.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.890
I see.

24:38.810 --> 24:43.355
My skills are at a different level
to your common ones.

24:47.277 --> 24:53.073
Where did you learn
these skills?

24:54.993 --> 24:58.996
From reading the analects
of Confucious and Mencius.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.585
And also my rival
was only you.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.173
Only me?

25:11.134 --> 25:15.804
You're not really a rival
for me, are you?

25:26.900 --> 25:28.067
Mr. MA.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.069
Yeah?

25:32.030 --> 25:36.784
Where did you learn
those skills?

25:36.826 --> 25:39.620
What, of cutting up
an octopus?

25:39.621 --> 25:43.791
No, the skill you taught me
the other day.

25:44.209 --> 25:49.630
From Mr. JANG.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.883
Mr. JANG?

25:54.719 --> 26:00.599
A playboy from Jeolla
who slept with thousand women.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.185
20 thousand?

26:04.396 --> 26:07.898
You think it's a lie?

26:11.111 --> 26:15.447
He must have been
really handsome.

26:17.742 --> 26:20.202
You don't get women
with your looks.

26:22.914 --> 26:26.667
With money, then?

26:28.461 --> 26:29.878
Silly boy.

26:30.797 --> 26:34.800
He knew how to read
women's minds.

26:35.468 --> 26:39.805
He taught me
the skills to do that.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.475
What's wrong with you?

26:46.021 --> 26:49.189
I don't take on anyone
as a disciple.

26:52.402 --> 26:59.241
Is this for Chun-hyang?
You want her?

26:59.909 --> 27:04.872
I want her so badly.

27:06.916 --> 27:10.794
He might be an noble

27:12.714 --> 27:14.173
but it's so unfair.

27:17.510 --> 27:23.974
Don't think I've made you
a proper disciple.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.976
But since the situation
is urgent,

27:27.520 --> 27:30.773
I'll give you a crash course.

27:32.484 --> 27:37.071
First, sit side by side
like this.

27:37.113 --> 27:41.075
This is the basic position.

27:41.117 --> 27:45.287
Those that sit up like this,
they know nothings.

27:45.288 --> 27:50.542
And then you
lie down like this.

27:55.215 --> 27:58.008
You don't make her lie down?

27:59.302 --> 28:03.013
Stop talking and
try to get me to lie down.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.974
Okay.

28:12.107 --> 28:18.987
It's been a long walk here.
Shall we lie down and talk?

28:34.587 --> 28:38.549
See? Not easy to get her
to lie down.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.468
I see.

28:44.097 --> 28:48.809
But even though
I lie down....

28:50.603 --> 28:51.562
Sit down

29:14.210 --> 29:16.378
This feels nice.

29:17.589 --> 29:28.807
And you lie down like and
stop talking. And, then...

29:30.935 --> 29:32.644
Where do I touch?

29:33.688 --> 29:37.399
You don't touch anything.
Put your shoulder here.

29:40.111 --> 29:45.532
You stare
at her shoulder like this.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.661
At her shoulder?

29:51.289 --> 29:56.084
With all your heart.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.798
Like this.

30:06.846 --> 30:10.808
What?

30:13.436 --> 30:15.562
Thought you
were staring at me.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.566
I wasn't staring at you.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.278
You weren't?

30:27.408 --> 30:32.079
And the final trick
is sneezing

30:35.333 --> 30:37.000
Think I'm coming down
with a cold.

30:54.602 --> 30:55.894
You seem happy.

30:56.396 --> 31:00.899
Are we having chicken
for dinner?

31:06.322 --> 31:10.075
Wasn't sure
if I should tell you

31:11.786 --> 31:16.498
but Chun-hyang wrote to Mong.

31:16.499 --> 31:23.964
She did?

31:24.007 --> 31:24.965
Her servant?

31:25.508 --> 31:26.466
Yes...

31:26.509 --> 31:29.469
I took the letter from her.

31:42.025 --> 31:46.278
It's hot so I won't
be dressed properly

31:46.321 --> 31:49.406
but if you don't mind me
in flimsy clothing,

31:50.033 --> 31:51.909
I'd like to invite you
to my humble abode.

31:53.328 --> 31:59.666
It's so hot as I write that
I want to tear off my clothes.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.085
This doesn't seem right.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.549
How could she write
such a letter...

32:08.927 --> 32:13.555
It's called an SGTH letter.

32:14.015 --> 32:16.850
An SGTH letter?

32:16.935 --> 32:19.478
A letter that Slowly
Gets Them Horny.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.566
Someone else is behind this.

32:28.821 --> 32:31.657
SGTH letters are perfect
for cold bastards.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.826
Once he reads it
he'll come running.

32:35.703 --> 32:38.830
Then you can drive him crazy.

32:40.875 --> 32:44.836
And me?
Should I sleep with Bang-ja?

32:46.589 --> 32:49.091
That's up to you.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.177
I see.

32:54.138 --> 32:58.475
Best not to sleep with him.

33:00.061 --> 33:04.481
No woman has ever been abandoned
for not putting out easily.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.067
Go make some fruit salad.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.069
Yes.

33:13.700 --> 33:18.078
Something happened between
you and Bang-ja, right?

33:19.414 --> 33:21.873
What do you mean?

33:21.874 --> 33:25.502
Don't fool around
and tell me.

33:29.424 --> 33:33.385
He was just looking at me

33:33.428 --> 33:36.513
but I felt
all weird and weak.

33:39.100 --> 33:42.769
So you did it?

33:42.770 --> 33:46.356
Mom. I'm just saying
that's how I felt.

33:49.318 --> 33:53.864
He just looked at you?

33:54.782 --> 33:59.870
He lied down and kept staring
at my shoulder from behind.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.585
It can't be...

34:08.421 --> 34:10.088
He can't know the
'staring from behind' technique.

34:12.383 --> 34:15.761
How could a mere servant...

34:17.138 --> 34:19.473
What's 'staring from behind?'

34:23.686 --> 34:25.270
It can't be.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.691
What are you talking about?

35:08.606 --> 35:10.774
You said
you're in flimsy clothes

35:12.235 --> 35:13.693
but you're properly dressed.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.197
The day has turned cool.

35:42.723 --> 35:45.225
It was truly amazing.

35:47.895 --> 35:51.189
She was in pain
when she bled but

35:52.483 --> 35:57.571
soon she was
screaming forjoy.

35:59.907 --> 36:02.492
I can still hear her.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.670
I shouldn't tell
a servant this.

36:15.715 --> 36:16.798
Let's go.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.184
What's wrong, master?

36:27.977 --> 36:28.768
My stomach!

36:29.395 --> 36:33.481
He never got
to sleep with her.

36:34.609 --> 36:35.567
Sorry?

36:37.320 --> 36:39.696
He was horny the whole night,
but couldn't have sex.

36:40.531 --> 36:46.703
He was full of semen and
hence the tummy ache.

36:50.625 --> 36:57.047
I knew it! He lied to me.

36:57.089 --> 36:59.466
She's not that easy.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.056
What shall I do now?

37:09.894 --> 37:14.397
We have to get there
and take her first.

37:15.524 --> 37:16.483
'We'?

37:19.820 --> 37:20.862
I mean you.

37:22.990 --> 37:25.075
Hurry up!

37:52.019 --> 37:53.603
You...

37:54.355 --> 37:56.982
What are you doing here?

37:57.358 --> 37:58.483
How dare you? Leave!

38:00.361 --> 38:03.863
I just have to...
Hold on...

38:05.783 --> 38:06.866
Let go!

38:07.493 --> 38:10.370
Just listen to me...

38:10.788 --> 38:11.871
I'm going to scream!

38:11.914 --> 38:13.290
Please...

38:13.332 --> 38:14.374
I'm really going to scream.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.959
If you do,

38:16.419 --> 38:22.299
I'll be beaten to death
because of my low status.

38:43.612 --> 38:45.071
Why are you shivering?

38:53.414 --> 38:54.497
Because I'm scared.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.876
Then why did you come in?

39:00.838 --> 39:03.798
I didn't know
how scared I'd be.

39:09.096 --> 39:12.849
Mr. MA didn't teach you
a new skill today?

39:17.521 --> 39:23.401
He did but I can't remember.

39:24.695 --> 39:28.990
What was it?

39:33.704 --> 39:39.167
He told me to look at you.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.674
Then put my lips
on your cheek

39:48.427 --> 39:50.595
and ask if I can kiss you.

39:51.430 --> 39:52.764
What are you doing?

39:55.101 --> 40:04.984
Then, hold you and
ask you if I could hold you

40:08.280 --> 40:12.992
Then, touch you and
ask if I could touch you.

40:13.619 --> 40:14.619
What are you doing?

40:14.620 --> 40:16.162
I'm going to scream,
seriously!

40:16.914 --> 40:18.748
Can I undress you?

40:22.294 --> 40:26.589
Im going to scream!

40:26.632 --> 40:29.509
You don't want this?

40:30.094 --> 40:32.178
I'm going to scream!

40:39.937 --> 40:42.772
He told me to ask
if I can undress you and...

41:18.726 --> 41:20.894
We can't do this.

41:22.563 --> 41:23.855
Why not?

41:56.138 --> 41:58.139
We're the same rank.
Nothing will change for us.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.447
You're illiterate.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.075
Shouldn't put your
hand stamp on any docume

42:18.827 --> 42:20.161
It's alright.

42:20.829 --> 42:24.999
You don't even know
what you signed.

42:32.007 --> 42:38.680
What a great story.

42:39.098 --> 42:44.060
You beat the son
of an illustrious family.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.898
Tell me more
about the hand stamp.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.990
After we slept together

42:58.742 --> 43:00.285
She told me that
she has to marry Mong

43:01.120 --> 43:04.163
She made me sign a document

43:05.624 --> 43:07.959
promising to help her
in her mission.

43:08.794 --> 43:11.170
Help her in what?

43:12.631 --> 43:14.799
I was to bring
my master to her again.

43:15.384 --> 43:16.342
What?

43:17.219 --> 43:20.805
I persuaded him to go to her

43:21.932 --> 43:25.101
and they went
into the room at once!

43:35.487 --> 43:38.948
Don't you ever sleep?

43:39.617 --> 43:41.534
Servants don't sleep.

43:51.295 --> 43:55.256
What's that noise?

43:56.925 --> 43:58.801
I saw them through a gap
in the door.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.970
They were doing it standing

44:03.849 --> 44:12.065
Standing up?
Is that possible?

44:13.108 --> 44:17.528
Why are you shocked?
He's an aristocrat.

44:30.501 --> 44:31.876
What are you doing?

44:50.396 --> 44:52.563
Are you just
going to keep drinking?

44:57.319 --> 44:58.778
What do you care?

45:00.322 --> 45:08.371
You're sorry
about the noise?

45:10.749 --> 45:12.709
I didn't hear a thing.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.879
I was deep asleep.

45:19.466 --> 45:20.883
My mom told me to do it.

45:23.095 --> 45:26.973
She said men get excited
by the sound of moaning.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.478
That's not true.

45:37.943 --> 45:39.485
Think what you like.

46:28.494 --> 46:30.161
This is really tough for me.

48:50.135 --> 48:51.677
I have to have you,

48:55.682 --> 49:05.107
just to myself!
I have to!

49:23.794 --> 49:24.752
No!

49:25.712 --> 49:27.296
What's the matter?

49:31.718 --> 49:33.010
A long time ago,

49:34.429 --> 49:37.598
I went to a tavern run
by two sisters.

49:39.059 --> 49:40.851
Had a great time

49:42.729 --> 49:49.986
but I ended up
using some of my skills.

49:51.613 --> 49:52.571
And?

49:55.200 --> 49:59.370
There was a big feud
between them over me.

50:00.122 --> 50:05.501
The older one spiked her
sister's food.

50:06.336 --> 50:08.754
She didn't die,
but she went blind.

50:09.798 --> 50:12.216
Know who I'm talking about?

50:13.885 --> 50:15.302
Chun-hyang's mom.

50:16.430 --> 50:20.850
Stop now. She comes from
a long line of dangerous women.

50:27.399 --> 50:36.490
Whatever you tell me,
I can't help it.

50:38.410 --> 50:42.496
I have to have
her all to myself.

51:01.308 --> 51:02.683
What's happening?

51:04.895 --> 51:05.936
I've had my fun.

51:05.979 --> 51:08.481
Now I have to do
some serious studying.

51:23.330 --> 51:27.666
Does she know
you're leaving?

51:30.962 --> 51:32.755
She won't take it lying down
if I tell her.

51:33.507 --> 51:35.091
I'll tell her later.

51:38.428 --> 51:40.387
Out of sight, out of mind,
as they say.

51:44.226 --> 51:50.189
I want you to do something.

51:54.444 --> 52:00.866
I gave her an oath.
Go and get it back.

52:07.707 --> 52:08.749
Did he order you to do that?

52:15.882 --> 52:17.758
What? Yes.

52:19.719 --> 52:21.053
So he's leaving?

52:21.721 --> 52:32.273
He's going to Seoul.
Let's just give it to him.

52:40.991 --> 52:42.658
You nearly got
into big trouble.

52:44.703 --> 52:45.870
That's yours.

52:52.419 --> 52:53.794
This is his.

53:01.928 --> 53:03.929
Hyang-dan tried to trick me.

53:06.683 --> 53:07.933
Are you going with him?

53:10.896 --> 53:13.939
For now, yes.

53:16.985 --> 53:21.697
But I'll come down soon.

53:29.247 --> 53:34.501
It wouldn't have worked
out easily anyway.

53:38.423 --> 53:41.967
I see. I'll be waiting.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.388
I'll be back soon.

53:57.317 --> 53:58.400
Master...

54:00.820 --> 54:02.488
Well done.

54:02.530 --> 54:04.406
Master, I need to...

54:04.449 --> 54:06.492
Okay

54:21.091 --> 54:25.386
I, Bang-ja, having spent
a night with Chun-hyang,

54:26.012 --> 54:34.061
hereby promise to aid Chun-hyang
in her efforts to marry Mong.

54:44.155 --> 54:47.157
That's better.
Shall we go, master?

54:52.622 --> 54:54.039
You can stay here.

54:54.708 --> 54:55.582
Sorry?

54:56.084 --> 54:59.378
Send Chun-geun instead.

55:00.005 --> 55:01.880
What about me...?

55:08.805 --> 55:11.515
Yes, master.

55:12.434 --> 55:17.229
I hope you'll
be healthy, master.

55:18.189 --> 55:24.570
Stop all that, you bastard.

55:26.990 --> 55:36.165
I thought he looked funny
but I didn't care.

55:40.337 --> 55:43.172
I shouldn't in front of
a man of your position

55:43.214 --> 55:45.591
but I'd like to smoke.

55:47.093 --> 55:48.093
Go on.

55:49.220 --> 55:54.141
So, you were left alone
with Chun-hyang at last

55:55.602 --> 56:01.565
but her mom must have
been a hard match.

56:06.821 --> 56:09.406
I wanted him to see you, Sir.

56:10.533 --> 56:14.870
This is Bang-ja who looks
after our affairs.

56:17.207 --> 56:20.250
Nice to meet you, Sir.

56:26.257 --> 56:31.762
I would pour a drink
but my hands are busy.

56:33.890 --> 56:35.140
Let me help.

56:43.733 --> 56:50.072
I heard about you.
You're quite a fighter.

56:51.116 --> 56:52.616
An over-estimation, Sir.

56:53.535 --> 56:58.664
If you press me
with your thumb,

56:58.706 --> 57:00.958
I'll drop dead.

57:01.793 --> 57:03.502
Quite a talker.

57:05.922 --> 57:08.048
So you want to supply to
government offices.

57:13.430 --> 57:15.973
What do you know
about my title?

57:16.516 --> 57:24.523
I come from humble origins
so I'm not sure

57:25.650 --> 57:29.778
but I know there's you
at the top

57:30.780 --> 57:36.785
and some other positions.

57:48.006 --> 57:51.884
This is Bang-ja of Chungpung
that I told you about.

57:54.095 --> 57:56.263
I worked at Chungpung and

57:57.557 --> 57:59.266
her mom turned a blind eye

57:59.934 --> 58:02.895
to our monthly meetings.

58:04.522 --> 58:08.484
I was allowed to work outside
by the main house

58:08.526 --> 58:10.486
in return for bringing them
money every month.

58:14.824 --> 58:19.077
People started calling me
Mr.Yi from then on.

58:24.292 --> 58:25.250
What are you playing at?

58:31.382 --> 58:32.883
You're going
to keep touching me?

58:34.844 --> 58:36.762
Why not?

58:39.807 --> 58:41.683
I want to touch you too.

59:06.751 --> 59:09.002
Those were the good days.

59:26.729 --> 59:27.896
Are you alright?

59:31.317 --> 59:32.985
Are you new?

59:33.820 --> 59:36.196
It's me, Chun-hyang.

59:36.823 --> 59:41.451
Oh dear, my time must be up.

59:45.915 --> 59:46.957
Are you alright?

1:00:01.723 --> 1:00:04.349
You look very unwell.
I'll go find some gruel.

1:00:16.237 --> 1:00:17.237
What the hell.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:18.947
But I am sick.

1:00:24.829 --> 1:00:26.872
Is she really yours now?

1:00:30.710 --> 1:00:39.468
I don't know. Maybe.
I'm not at ease.

1:00:42.305 --> 1:00:46.558
Thought you'd be able to relax
being with someone like her?

1:00:59.489 --> 1:01:00.697
I think I'm on my way out.

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:08.080
You're fine judging by
what you tried to do earlier.

1:01:11.417 --> 1:01:16.713
This reminds me of Mr. JANG.

1:01:19.133 --> 1:01:23.345
He masturbated right
before he died.

1:01:23.888 --> 1:01:26.973
What? Before he died?

1:01:27.016 --> 1:01:32.270
It was a windy night
and he was masturbating.

1:01:33.898 --> 1:01:36.191
I was crying next to him.

1:01:39.404 --> 1:01:46.576
He came and died.
He died a happy man.

1:01:53.334 --> 1:01:57.963
It was stifffor three hours
afterwards.

1:01:59.298 --> 1:02:01.049
We almost couldn't
dress the corpse.

1:02:06.472 --> 1:02:13.353
The shape and its color
Most of all, the size!

1:02:15.732 --> 1:02:17.065
How big was it?

1:02:20.111 --> 1:02:21.361
He could suck it himself.

1:02:38.588 --> 1:02:42.883
Mong passed the state exam!

1:02:43.301 --> 1:02:44.634
He's become
a royal inspector!

1:02:45.595 --> 1:02:46.636
Really?

1:02:46.679 --> 1:02:48.889
The whole village
is celebrating.

1:02:51.100 --> 1:02:55.562
I forgot about some chores.
Got to go.

1:02:59.525 --> 1:03:02.277
Come here.
Take this to him.

1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:05.280
Hope you get well soon.

1:03:05.281 --> 1:03:06.448
Bye.

1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:32.557
You the
newly-appointed officials?

1:03:33.142 --> 1:03:34.392
Yes.

1:03:35.603 --> 1:03:36.728
First,

1:03:41.692 --> 1:03:46.655
the royal inspector?

1:03:46.697 --> 1:03:48.448
Not me.

1:03:49.700 --> 1:03:51.660
Who are you?

1:03:52.203 --> 1:03:56.373
The newly-appointed
magistrate for Namwon.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:58.750
Why didn't
you say that earlier?

1:03:59.710 --> 1:04:02.295
Which one
is the royal inspector?

1:04:02.338 --> 1:04:04.464
I am.

1:04:11.472 --> 1:04:14.975
This has been left blank.

1:04:15.017 --> 1:04:17.269
Write down
where you want to go.

1:04:18.187 --> 1:04:19.896
I get to choose?

1:04:21.023 --> 1:04:23.358
The document
and the royal badge.

1:04:23.401 --> 1:04:26.987
This one only
has two horses.

1:04:27.780 --> 1:04:29.573
They changed
the regulation for that.

1:04:29.615 --> 1:04:34.077
And the ruler?

1:04:35.037 --> 1:04:40.750
Where? Must have dropped it
on the way.

1:04:43.921 --> 1:04:45.630
You're useless!

1:04:48.926 --> 1:04:50.886
What's going on?

1:04:53.389 --> 1:04:54.890
What are you playing at?

1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:58.768
You've been drinking
and made us wait.

1:05:02.523 --> 1:05:04.399
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's.

1:05:04.692 --> 1:05:05.483
What?

1:05:14.327 --> 1:05:15.660
I've made a big mistake.

1:05:15.703 --> 1:05:20.665
Alright.
You have a temper.

1:05:23.502 --> 1:05:26.671
We know you look down
on us eunuchs.

1:05:27.590 --> 1:05:30.383
That's not true...

1:05:30.426 --> 1:05:34.012
You despise us, don't you?

1:05:34.305 --> 1:05:36.389
We eunuchs all look
the same to you.

1:05:36.807 --> 1:05:43.396
but you're the same.
No personality.

1:05:43.439 --> 1:05:46.483
There are so many
royal inspectors these days.

1:05:47.610 --> 1:05:53.281
You need a unique personality
and a lofty position.

1:05:54.575 --> 1:06:01.665
A unique story
from a special man.

1:06:03.209 --> 1:06:12.467
But what would you know
about that?

1:06:27.024 --> 1:06:28.566
I'm also from Namwon.

1:06:28.609 --> 1:06:30.568
Really?

1:06:32.488 --> 1:06:36.282
I look forward to
your guidance from now on.

1:06:41.414 --> 1:06:45.500
You seemed
disappointed earlier.

1:06:46.127 --> 1:06:47.502
Yes.

1:06:50.131 --> 1:06:53.383
I thought 'I did all that
studying just for this?'

1:06:54.343 --> 1:06:57.345
I knew it wouldn't
amount to much.

1:07:00.516 --> 1:07:01.766
Really?

1:07:03.227 --> 1:07:05.186
Then why did you
work so hard?

1:07:06.230 --> 1:07:07.564
To be honest,

1:07:09.608 --> 1:07:13.194
I did it to bed
as many women as possible.

1:07:14.613 --> 1:07:15.572
What?

1:07:15.614 --> 1:07:18.116
As a magistrate,

1:07:18.117 --> 1:07:21.286
I can sleep with
all the women ofthe town.

1:07:23.122 --> 1:07:25.206
I have clear aims.

1:07:26.542 --> 1:07:29.878
I'm not interested in
anything else.

1:07:32.506 --> 1:07:35.175
Nice and simple.

1:07:39.138 --> 1:07:41.556
What will you do?

1:07:41.974 --> 1:07:44.184
Search out corrupt officials and

1:07:44.226 --> 1:07:48.271
collect praiseworthy stories?

1:07:49.607 --> 1:07:53.485
The royal palace loves
those stories.

1:07:54.820 --> 1:07:58.198
and they'll hand out titles
for them.

1:08:06.874 --> 1:08:08.083
Stories...

1:08:09.210 --> 1:08:15.840
A unique story
from a special man.

1:08:23.599 --> 1:08:25.475
Do you know many women
in Namwon?

1:08:28.604 --> 1:08:31.689
No. Have anyone in mind?

1:08:34.443 --> 1:08:40.865
Are you into unique women?
Really unusual?

1:08:43.202 --> 1:08:44.577
I love unusual women.

1:08:44.620 --> 1:08:47.372
I can't get hard
when they're normal.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:52.293
What do you mean by 'unique?'

1:09:03.639 --> 1:09:06.224
Why are you getting
so many new clothes?

1:09:06.725 --> 1:09:09.394
Cos I feel like it.

1:09:12.481 --> 1:09:14.190
Is it for Mong?

1:09:14.775 --> 1:09:16.192
Bring the rest.

1:09:23.242 --> 1:09:24.659
That's not the only reason.

1:09:33.085 --> 1:09:35.211
Thought you were
happy with Bang-ja.

1:09:40.009 --> 1:09:41.050
I am.

1:09:42.261 --> 1:09:43.928
Then what are you doing?

1:09:43.971 --> 1:09:47.849
What's up with you?
I'm confused.

1:09:49.602 --> 1:09:54.397
Thought you wanted to sell me
to the highest bidder.

1:09:55.983 --> 1:09:57.400
That's true

1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:01.946
but you two look so happy.

1:10:05.910 --> 1:10:07.285
It's a shame.

1:10:15.836 --> 1:10:17.670
I laid the trap.

1:10:18.297 --> 1:10:19.839
I want to see
if he'll take the bait.

1:10:22.218 --> 1:10:25.845
Even if I don't want him.
I'm curious.

1:10:36.732 --> 1:10:42.403
We don't have anything else
to give you

1:10:43.822 --> 1:10:44.864
but here's a five-horse one.

1:10:47.993 --> 1:10:51.955
Isn't this fraud?

1:10:52.414 --> 1:10:55.375
Lighten up.

1:10:56.168 --> 1:10:59.462
Times have changed.

1:11:00.172 --> 1:11:04.676
You have to
keep up your standards.

1:11:25.322 --> 1:11:29.367
This place
is doing good business.

1:11:29.410 --> 1:11:30.952
Wasn't like this before.

1:11:32.621 --> 1:11:34.580
Since the new owner came,
it's been good.

1:11:37.626 --> 1:11:38.960
There she is.

1:12:01.066 --> 1:12:03.568
They threw me out.

1:12:05.195 --> 1:12:07.155
Maybe they got
too self-conscious.

1:12:08.615 --> 1:12:15.496
You don't know, right?
Bang-ja and Chun-hyang...

1:12:19.626 --> 1:12:26.424
Really? I had no idea.

1:12:26.425 --> 1:12:28.259
C'est la vie.

1:12:35.184 --> 1:12:37.477
She must have
felt bad for me.

1:12:38.103 --> 1:12:40.063
She gave me the seed money.

1:12:42.107 --> 1:12:45.401
I gritted my teeth and
worked my ass off.

1:12:48.822 --> 1:12:52.408
And, here I am.

1:12:53.452 --> 1:12:58.498
You were always clever.

1:13:13.722 --> 1:13:17.058
Is it good?

1:13:17.101 --> 1:13:18.768
Love it!

1:13:19.019 --> 1:13:19.977
Good?

1:13:33.450 --> 1:13:39.247
I'm better than Chun-hyang,
aren't I?

1:13:40.082 --> 1:13:44.585
She's nothing.
I'm way hotter than her.

1:14:01.645 --> 1:14:08.276
I've never slept
with a servant before.

1:14:09.319 --> 1:14:11.487
I had many chances

1:14:13.073 --> 1:14:15.074
but didn't want
to take advantage of my position.

1:14:15.075 --> 1:14:17.243
He was into me first.

1:14:19.788 --> 1:14:20.872
What are you saying?

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:24.250
I mean Bang-ja.

1:14:25.627 --> 1:14:28.171
He liked me first.

1:14:30.632 --> 1:14:35.344
He saw me
and started talking to me.

1:14:37.014 --> 1:14:38.890
He asked me,
'Do you work here?'

1:14:59.620 --> 1:15:02.163
Why is he so important?
He's only a servant.

1:15:02.915 --> 1:15:05.249
He's not important.

1:15:06.710 --> 1:15:09.378
I'm just saying
he liked me first.

1:15:12.633 --> 1:15:15.176
If I hadn't been
a servant...

1:15:27.606 --> 1:15:30.608
You look terrible.

1:15:32.402 --> 1:15:34.278
Take a look in the mirror.

1:15:39.409 --> 1:15:43.287
Find anyone suitable?

1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:49.710
I went round
the whole town but...

1:15:51.171 --> 1:15:54.423
You'll meet someone
very unusual soon.

1:15:55.884 --> 1:15:59.971
Is Chun-hyang
really that special?

1:16:02.182 --> 1:16:08.896
She plays hard to get.

1:16:10.649 --> 1:16:19.073
You'll have to scold her
and imprison her.

1:16:19.408 --> 1:16:22.285
And she'll only obey
after you draw blood.

1:16:25.998 --> 1:16:31.460
Sounds just perfect.

1:16:33.463 --> 1:16:36.465
You've come
to the right place.

1:16:40.721 --> 1:16:42.179
Thank you.

1:16:42.472 --> 1:16:44.807
That's too much.

1:16:44.808 --> 1:16:45.683
See you soon.

1:17:15.922 --> 1:17:20.092
Is that you? Master?

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:23.554
Your clothes...

1:17:24.723 --> 1:17:29.810
Let me greet you properly.
How have you been?

1:17:30.270 --> 1:17:35.274
Congratulations
on passing the exam.

1:17:36.818 --> 1:17:40.071
Thanks.

1:17:41.281 --> 1:17:44.450
Almost didn't recognize you.

1:17:48.413 --> 1:17:51.874
It's been a long time.

1:17:56.421 --> 1:18:00.716
This place is doing
better than before.

1:18:08.892 --> 1:18:11.769
Take your time. I can wait.

1:18:12.479 --> 1:18:13.562
Master.

1:18:18.902 --> 1:18:26.450
Chun-hyang is unwell

1:18:28.036 --> 1:18:29.787
so she can't see you today.

1:18:41.591 --> 1:18:43.551
She may be ill

1:18:44.094 --> 1:18:46.554
but I'm here after
all these years have passed

1:18:52.018 --> 1:18:52.977
Tell her I'm here.

1:18:54.020 --> 1:19:08.367
But you did leave her so

1:19:10.287 --> 1:19:12.788
it might be better for you
not to see her.

1:19:17.294 --> 1:19:22.089
You've grown insolent.

1:19:23.508 --> 1:19:25.634
Giving me orders?

1:19:31.516 --> 1:19:32.558
What are you doing?

1:19:33.310 --> 1:19:35.394
What could I do?

1:19:36.855 --> 1:19:42.401
I hope you'll take
my position into account.

1:19:46.406 --> 1:19:49.158
Alright.

1:19:51.286 --> 1:19:55.080
Just tell her at least.

1:19:56.917 --> 1:19:58.876
I'll go if she won't see me.

1:20:29.825 --> 1:20:30.908
You didn't take long.

1:20:32.577 --> 1:20:33.577
What did he say?

1:20:34.704 --> 1:20:35.996
Not much.

1:20:36.039 --> 1:20:36.997
Huh?

1:20:39.042 --> 1:20:43.671
Not much.
He wants to see me again.

1:20:47.050 --> 1:20:48.300
Are you going to help them?

1:20:50.011 --> 1:20:50.970
Yes.

1:20:55.308 --> 1:20:56.267
Get to work

1:21:14.202 --> 1:21:15.286
What's Chun-hyang doing?

1:21:15.620 --> 1:21:17.746
Staring into space.

1:21:17.789 --> 1:21:19.081
She's not getting ready?

1:21:19.124 --> 1:21:20.082
No.

1:21:22.043 --> 1:21:23.878
What is she doing?
I told her to get ready.

1:21:32.220 --> 1:21:34.179
She's been caught.

1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:43.564
A round of applause!

1:21:45.233 --> 1:21:46.984
Do this until you're naked!

1:21:47.027 --> 1:21:48.986
Take it off.

1:21:49.613 --> 1:21:51.572
Let's do it again!

1:21:56.036 --> 1:21:57.244
Why aren't you joining us?

1:21:57.287 --> 1:22:01.248
Don't mind me.

1:22:01.291 --> 1:22:04.084
You must feel awkward here

1:22:04.419 --> 1:22:06.837
being from
such a humble background.

1:22:07.923 --> 1:22:10.257
I guess so.

1:22:10.592 --> 1:22:15.763
I understand but I'm worried

1:22:17.515 --> 1:22:22.102
You'll make things
tough for us.

1:22:22.145 --> 1:22:26.565
Don't worry about that.

1:22:27.150 --> 1:22:30.653
You're shutting yourself
offfrom us clerks.

1:22:32.030 --> 1:22:34.281
I'm worried
you're too eager

1:22:34.282 --> 1:22:35.991
to do yourjob.
That won't do.

1:22:37.494 --> 1:22:39.286
- If you don't
-Right.

1:22:39.287 --> 1:22:44.583
know what you're doing
and you're too eager...

1:22:44.584 --> 1:22:51.382
I'll discuss everything with you.

1:22:52.425 --> 1:22:56.095
- Wait!
- Hey!

1:22:56.137 --> 1:23:00.683
I'm glad we have
an understanding.

1:23:00.725 --> 1:23:06.271
I feel I can discuss
what's on my mind.

1:23:10.193 --> 1:23:11.360
This way.

1:23:21.121 --> 1:23:23.288
This is Bang-ja
from Chungpung.

1:23:23.331 --> 1:23:24.748
He's useful to know.

1:23:24.791 --> 1:23:25.749
I see.

1:23:26.626 --> 1:23:27.751
Nice to meet you, Sir.

1:23:27.794 --> 1:23:28.752
Really?

1:23:33.883 --> 1:23:41.557
I heard the owner's daughter,
Chun-hyang,

1:23:42.684 --> 1:23:48.856
that she is a good singer.
I wish to hear her sing.

1:23:49.399 --> 1:23:50.357
Is that possible?

1:23:52.027 --> 1:23:58.115
I told her to get ready
but she's not well.

1:23:58.116 --> 1:24:00.117
There are so many
other girls here.

1:24:00.118 --> 1:24:01.201
Alright, you may go now.

1:24:01.244 --> 1:24:07.875
Don't get involved.

1:24:07.917 --> 1:24:11.462
I really want to hear
her sing.

1:24:13.882 --> 1:24:15.466
Just have a drink.

1:24:20.805 --> 1:24:23.182
This is
what I meant earlier.

1:24:23.892 --> 1:24:25.768
Do you follow me?

1:24:34.319 --> 1:24:36.195
I want to see her,
so bring her.

1:24:36.237 --> 1:24:38.489
What's the problem?

1:24:40.533 --> 1:24:43.660
I'll bring her.
Please don't be angry.

1:24:47.207 --> 1:24:52.086
This is a delicate matter.
Don't get involved.

1:25:01.513 --> 1:25:08.852
I don't look my best but
here I am at your service.

1:25:09.521 --> 1:25:10.771
Good to see you.

1:25:12.607 --> 1:25:14.775
You're beautiful,
just as I heard.

1:25:15.735 --> 1:25:17.194
Not at all, Sir.

1:25:17.779 --> 1:25:20.948
You don't want
to sing for me?

1:25:21.491 --> 1:25:27.371
I'd love to but I'm in
no condition to sing.

1:25:27.872 --> 1:25:30.457
What?

1:25:30.500 --> 1:25:32.960
It's the magistrate's order.

1:25:33.002 --> 1:25:34.753
It's alright.

1:25:34.796 --> 1:25:36.588
She has a problem today.

1:25:36.631 --> 1:25:37.589
Okay.

1:25:38.216 --> 1:25:42.302
Sit beside me and
pour me drinks.

1:25:44.514 --> 1:25:46.473
She's not someone
who does that kind of...

1:25:49.018 --> 1:25:51.353
There must have been
a misunderstanding.

1:25:52.230 --> 1:25:53.856
I'm not a giseng.

1:25:55.400 --> 1:25:56.775
Not a giseng?

1:25:56.776 --> 1:25:58.485
Aren't you
a giseng's daughter?

1:26:00.238 --> 1:26:02.489
If you're going to be rude,

1:26:03.324 --> 1:26:05.033
why don't you
have fun with a giseng?

1:26:06.786 --> 1:26:09.788
How arrogant!

1:26:19.090 --> 1:26:23.677
She's young and doesn't
know any better.

1:26:25.972 --> 1:26:28.473
Please don't be angry.

1:26:28.516 --> 1:26:32.477
This town is a mess.

1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:37.065
Hold him.

1:26:38.318 --> 1:26:39.484
Sir,

1:26:42.238 --> 1:26:43.697
oh, sir!

1:26:54.334 --> 1:26:58.754
I'm not unreasonable.

1:26:59.881 --> 1:27:02.466
I wanted you
to pour me drinks.

1:27:03.968 --> 1:27:05.302
Why are you being
so arrogant?

1:27:07.222 --> 1:27:12.142
Ugly as well as stupid!

1:27:14.312 --> 1:27:18.774
Lock her up
until she sees reason.

1:27:18.816 --> 1:27:19.858
As for him...

1:27:23.988 --> 1:27:26.782
Is he dead?

1:27:33.498 --> 1:27:35.123
I'm drunk, I'm going.

1:27:52.892 --> 1:27:55.394
She has a weak constitution.

1:27:57.730 --> 1:28:01.400
She won't last long in jail.

1:28:02.026 --> 1:28:03.318
Spare her.

1:28:07.323 --> 1:28:11.368
Discuss it
with the clerk, not me.

1:28:13.329 --> 1:28:16.164
But who's in control
ofthis place?

1:28:18.167 --> 1:28:20.168
It's you, sir!

1:28:21.337 --> 1:28:23.797
It's true but...

1:28:27.176 --> 1:28:32.806
he's shut down Chungpung and
levied a lot oftaxes.

1:28:34.100 --> 1:28:38.395
It's out of my control.

1:28:58.833 --> 1:29:02.586
What happened to your face?

1:29:04.213 --> 1:29:06.590
I have something to say...

1:29:10.094 --> 1:29:11.053
Come in.

1:29:14.891 --> 1:29:15.849
Go.

1:29:16.684 --> 1:29:18.769
Would you like something
sweet to drink?

1:29:19.437 --> 1:29:20.562
Go now!

1:29:20.980 --> 1:29:22.773
Let me just clean this bit.

1:29:22.815 --> 1:29:24.858
I said get out!

1:29:28.696 --> 1:29:32.783
Temper, temper!

1:29:39.207 --> 1:29:41.416
Look at you...

1:29:52.178 --> 1:29:53.887
Help me, master.

1:29:55.264 --> 1:29:56.681
I know you can.

1:30:04.023 --> 1:30:05.774
You weren't happy
when I came back,

1:30:08.194 --> 1:30:10.404
asking me
not to get involved.

1:30:12.532 --> 1:30:14.783
Why ask for help now?

1:30:22.166 --> 1:30:27.879
I didn't know any better.

1:30:31.175 --> 1:30:32.884
Forgive me, master.

1:30:40.810 --> 1:30:43.061
I'll sort out everything.

1:30:45.523 --> 1:30:47.065
How can you?

1:30:52.280 --> 1:30:54.239
Don't you trust me?

1:30:57.618 --> 1:30:59.327
You don't have any power.

1:31:01.372 --> 1:31:04.249
I know you'll just ask
for other people's help.

1:31:06.377 --> 1:31:07.961
What else can I do?

1:31:13.301 --> 1:31:19.264
A worm can only crawl.

1:31:24.270 --> 1:31:28.565
So, if you

1:31:33.905 --> 1:31:43.371
have to serve him...

1:31:45.625 --> 1:31:47.250
Ifthere is no other way,

1:31:48.711 --> 1:31:50.170
just do it.

1:31:52.548 --> 1:31:53.590
Really?

1:31:57.094 --> 1:31:58.053
Yes.

1:32:23.037 --> 1:32:26.164
What a picture!

1:32:28.543 --> 1:32:30.001
You'll get her pregnant
in jail.

1:33:09.375 --> 1:33:11.167
What if he doesn't come?

1:33:12.003 --> 1:33:13.253
He will.

1:33:14.088 --> 1:33:15.964
He left his royal badge
with me.

1:33:19.385 --> 1:33:22.679
How about Chun-hyang?

1:33:23.222 --> 1:33:27.601
He said he brought her
but I don't see her.

1:33:27.643 --> 1:33:31.104
This is making me mad.

1:33:31.105 --> 1:33:36.610
You think Mong deceived you?

1:33:37.903 --> 1:33:42.782
He's coming.
I'm sure of it.

1:33:43.117 --> 1:33:45.702
You can't trust nobles!

1:33:55.504 --> 1:34:02.093
Many books teach you
how a ruler should behave

1:34:02.637 --> 1:34:06.890
but it's hard to find
a good magistrate.

1:34:06.932 --> 1:34:14.272
But one such magistrate
has come to our town.

1:34:14.815 --> 1:34:16.524
He's going to say a few words...

1:34:18.903 --> 1:34:21.988
but... he is at present...

1:34:34.418 --> 1:34:42.008
You must have got
bored waiting.

1:34:45.805 --> 1:34:49.182
Some food?

1:34:54.730 --> 1:34:57.565
Aren't you
ashamed of yourself?

1:34:58.818 --> 1:35:07.575
I love it when you get
argumentative.

1:35:11.122 --> 1:35:12.997
You love it, right?

1:35:14.041 --> 1:35:21.548
I'm sure you have naughty
thoughts all the time.

1:35:21.799 --> 1:35:24.467
You into S & M?

1:35:24.802 --> 1:35:26.344
What do you
think you're doing?

1:35:28.097 --> 1:35:32.475
It's alright.
I know about you.

1:35:33.310 --> 1:35:37.647
Stupid is, stupid does.

1:35:39.108 --> 1:35:47.907
Does it feel good?
And this?

1:35:54.373 --> 1:35:57.542
Are you alright?

1:35:59.003 --> 1:36:00.462
Move your hand!

1:36:06.594 --> 1:36:11.639
I love it
when you get angry!

1:36:16.020 --> 1:36:21.483
Sorry, I have to touch you!

1:36:32.411 --> 1:36:34.788
You like it, huh?

1:36:44.215 --> 1:36:45.465
Sir!

1:36:46.675 --> 1:36:50.094
What? You startled me.

1:36:53.015 --> 1:36:54.182
I have something to say.

1:36:54.225 --> 1:36:55.558
What's going on?

1:36:56.018 --> 1:36:57.352
Sir!

1:36:59.897 --> 1:37:03.149
Please forgive Chun-hyang!

1:37:03.192 --> 1:37:05.902
It's that guy
from the other day.

1:37:08.405 --> 1:37:11.449
Please release her.
I know she's done wrong.

1:37:12.409 --> 1:37:14.577
What's wrong with you?

1:37:14.578 --> 1:37:16.079
Please let her go.

1:37:16.121 --> 1:37:22.085
What's going on?
You'll pay for this.

1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:28.675
Let go!

1:37:30.386 --> 1:37:33.972
Please, sir...

1:37:34.014 --> 1:37:35.056
Sir.

1:37:35.099 --> 1:37:37.892
What are you looking at?
Beat him!

1:38:03.752 --> 1:38:22.979
Here comes
the Royal inspector!

1:38:31.530 --> 1:38:36.200
The drink in the gold cup
is the blood ofthe people,

1:38:38.203 --> 1:38:43.249
the food on the pearl plate
is the flesh ofthe people.

1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:49.380
Not sure what it means
but it sounds good.

1:38:49.423 --> 1:38:52.675
It means that the drink comes

1:38:52.676 --> 1:38:56.679
from the efforts
of a thousand people and...

1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:58.014
That's not really the case...

1:38:58.015 --> 1:38:59.098
Okay.

1:38:59.141 --> 1:39:03.561
The new magistrate
welcomed him with a smile.

1:39:05.940 --> 1:39:07.273
He did?

1:39:08.692 --> 1:39:11.819
He wouldn't be intimidated

1:39:12.780 --> 1:39:19.827
But then, the inspector
imprisoned him.

1:39:22.289 --> 1:39:24.582
The joke's gone too far.

1:39:24.583 --> 1:39:28.378
Then, he harasses Chun-hyang.

1:39:29.505 --> 1:39:31.381
I'll ask you one more time.

1:39:32.424 --> 1:39:34.300
He was a corrupt magistrate

1:39:34.301 --> 1:39:36.302
but still
an order of an official,

1:39:36.303 --> 1:39:38.596
why did you
refuse to serve him?

1:39:38.889 --> 1:39:43.309
I told you.
I'm not a giseng.

1:39:44.311 --> 1:39:47.188
Why should I serve him?

1:39:55.781 --> 1:39:57.657
Not a giseng?

1:40:01.412 --> 1:40:05.873
Think your behaviour is
better than that of a giseng?

1:40:05.874 --> 1:40:10.211
What do you know about me?

1:40:12.047 --> 1:40:14.215
I know nothing
of your behaviour

1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:18.344
but who knows
you're nothing but talk

1:40:19.513 --> 1:40:22.181
You'll tell the truth once
you're beaten.

1:40:27.771 --> 1:40:28.855
Spit it out.

1:40:30.899 --> 1:40:36.654
Chastity means nothing
in this filthy world.

1:40:43.037 --> 1:40:45.663
If you refused while not keeping
your chastity in private,

1:40:47.332 --> 1:40:49.125
I'll beat you to death.

1:41:03.515 --> 1:41:05.099
What's this?

1:41:09.688 --> 1:41:14.859
She has a husband.

1:41:16.236 --> 1:41:20.114
Please release her.

1:41:21.158 --> 1:41:25.453
Is that so?
Release her, then.

1:41:25.496 --> 1:41:26.454
Yes, Sir.

1:41:36.131 --> 1:41:45.681
Is this lowly man
your husband?

1:41:51.980 --> 1:41:57.944
No, he's just a servant
at my house.

1:42:26.723 --> 1:42:30.351
Royal Inspector!

1:42:32.604 --> 1:42:34.856
You're right.

1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:41.571
I haven't kept my chastity
so I should have served him.

1:42:42.489 --> 1:42:43.489
When...

1:42:51.331 --> 1:42:53.040
my love left,

1:42:53.792 --> 1:42:58.796
he asked me
to keep a promise.

1:43:00.799 --> 1:43:05.469
I was torn.

1:43:07.389 --> 1:43:13.060
Break the promise
to my love

1:43:13.896 --> 1:43:19.483
or be beaten to death
by a nobleman.

1:43:31.705 --> 1:43:37.835
Please pass my regards
to Mong ofthe YI family.

1:43:47.888 --> 1:43:51.849
Chun-hyang, open your eyes.

1:43:59.524 --> 1:44:04.695
It's me, I'm back.

1:44:05.447 --> 1:44:09.992
You were waiting for me.

1:44:10.494 --> 1:44:12.662
Open your eyes.

1:44:17.876 --> 1:44:26.759
I only wanted to test you.

1:44:33.016 --> 1:44:37.144
If you die,

1:44:39.022 --> 1:44:42.400
what's the point of me
having become a royal inspector?

1:45:09.803 --> 1:45:11.053
Hold on.

1:45:11.430 --> 1:45:15.891
The Royals' have gone crazy
about her story offidelity

1:45:16.685 --> 1:45:21.480
They're going to erect
a monument in her honor.

1:45:24.192 --> 1:45:25.401
Great.

1:45:26.528 --> 1:45:30.239
Things have gotten
more than great for Mong

1:45:30.991 --> 1:45:34.160
He's been promoted
by two grades, too.

1:45:37.539 --> 1:45:44.420
She betrayed you
so she won't come, will she?

1:45:44.421 --> 1:45:45.796
Of course not.

1:45:47.549 --> 1:45:52.470
If she does...
You never know.

1:45:53.096 --> 1:45:57.058
If she comes,
don't beg her to stay.

1:45:59.269 --> 1:46:00.227
What do you mean?

1:46:00.979 --> 1:46:05.066
The game's up
if you beg her to stay.

1:46:06.526 --> 1:46:09.236
Act cold.

1:46:09.905 --> 1:46:14.575
Act as if you're
happy she's leaving you.

1:46:18.121 --> 1:46:19.705
Don't worry.

1:46:20.624 --> 1:46:22.500
I was going to do that anyway.

1:46:33.261 --> 1:46:38.891
Comb your hair.

1:46:39.267 --> 1:46:42.269
A man's style
is all about his hair.

1:47:21.017 --> 1:47:23.978
They're releasing you today.
Hold on a bit more.

1:47:24.813 --> 1:47:25.771
Yes,

1:47:29.943 --> 1:47:31.569
I heard.

1:47:31.611 --> 1:47:32.862
You're angry at me?

1:47:34.781 --> 1:47:36.574
What's there
to be angry about?

1:47:39.619 --> 1:47:40.578
Why did you do it?

1:47:43.915 --> 1:47:45.166
Why?

1:47:46.793 --> 1:47:50.087
I told you everything
about our plan.

1:47:50.088 --> 1:47:51.338
Why did you do it?

1:47:52.382 --> 1:47:55.259
When I met the magistrate,

1:47:56.219 --> 1:47:58.679
an idea came to me.

1:48:01.558 --> 1:48:05.352
Shall we make up
a fake story?

1:48:06.688 --> 1:48:11.775
It'll help us both.

1:48:18.366 --> 1:48:21.869
This was all set up.

1:48:22.913 --> 1:48:29.793
You knew that,
so why did you do it?

1:48:30.295 --> 1:48:31.587
I wanted to help you.

1:48:33.006 --> 1:48:38.260
The plan had to be
convincing, right?

1:48:41.806 --> 1:48:46.352
I've not done anything for you

1:48:51.024 --> 1:48:52.691
and I always felt
bad about that.

1:48:55.028 --> 1:49:00.157
Plus, I couldn't trust Mong.

1:49:07.123 --> 1:49:08.290
Wait!

1:49:16.299 --> 1:49:21.887
I have to tell you something.

1:49:23.890 --> 1:49:25.057
What?

1:49:26.101 --> 1:49:27.059
I...

1:49:31.398 --> 1:49:32.898
love you.

1:49:38.321 --> 1:49:39.780
What did you say?

1:49:40.490 --> 1:49:41.907
I love you.

1:49:44.202 --> 1:49:49.331
I'm a servant so
I don't have the right.

1:49:52.711 --> 1:49:53.877
But, I love you.

1:50:07.726 --> 1:50:10.603
Lucky Chun-hyang!

1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:17.234
Aren't you dizzy?

1:50:21.197 --> 1:50:22.948
I have to take
Bang-ja with me.

1:50:30.373 --> 1:50:31.373
What?

1:50:31.374 --> 1:50:33.542
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

1:50:40.383 --> 1:50:41.800
Have you gone mad?

1:50:43.386 --> 1:50:45.179
If I can't,
I'll tell them everything.

1:50:57.734 --> 1:51:01.153
Weird people.

1:51:03.490 --> 1:51:08.994
Truly weird.

1:51:09.412 --> 1:51:15.084
I know. But the three of us
got along surprisingly well.

1:51:16.127 --> 1:51:19.296
I was the one in pain.

1:51:22.008 --> 1:51:24.677
No, I thought
I was the one in pain.

1:51:34.896 --> 1:51:35.979
Bang-ja!

1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:07.803
What?

1:52:08.471 --> 1:52:10.180
There's a strange fish.

1:52:11.224 --> 1:52:12.558
Fish?

1:52:26.114 --> 1:52:28.073
Where the hell is it?

1:53:06.488 --> 1:53:09.531
Dear me, I pushed her.

1:53:47.195 --> 1:53:51.365
He kept sending people
after us.

1:53:53.827 --> 1:53:57.287
We kept running.

1:53:59.207 --> 1:54:00.666
I'm not surprised.

1:54:02.210 --> 1:54:04.086
He's one hell of a man.

1:54:04.838 --> 1:54:07.381
But you are amazing.

1:54:08.424 --> 1:54:11.969
You ran offwith
an aristocrat's woman.

1:54:16.474 --> 1:54:18.350
She wasn't his,

1:54:20.395 --> 1:54:22.062
but mine.

1:54:49.591 --> 1:54:51.633
This is she?

1:54:53.595 --> 1:54:55.387
She survived but

1:55:02.228 --> 1:55:07.399
became like a child.

1:55:08.776 --> 1:55:12.279
You've been on the run
with her like this?

1:55:14.782 --> 1:55:15.908
Yes.

1:55:17.994 --> 1:55:19.745
A heartbreaking tale.

1:55:21.664 --> 1:55:23.999
I'll write a good story
for you.

1:55:24.584 --> 1:55:27.461
The love of a servant.

1:55:27.795 --> 1:55:31.381
No, not like that.

1:55:33.134 --> 1:55:34.176
Then what?

1:55:35.136 --> 1:55:37.262
Beautify the story.

1:55:42.435 --> 1:55:49.691
Chun-hyang was on a swing
on a beautiful May day.

1:55:51.861 --> 1:55:57.282
She fell in love
with Mong at first sight.

1:55:58.868 --> 1:56:03.747
He went to Seoul,

1:56:03.790 --> 1:56:05.749
passed the exam,
she waited for him

1:56:09.587 --> 1:56:17.177
and they lived
happily ever after.

1:56:19.222 --> 1:56:24.726
If you want, I'll write it
like that but why?

1:56:25.853 --> 1:56:27.562
Because it's something

1:56:32.193 --> 1:56:33.986
she never got to have.

1:56:37.198 --> 1:56:39.366
The title should be

1:56:46.332 --> 1:56:54.506
'The Tale of Chun-hyang'

1:57:08.896 --> 1:57:13.859
'The Tale of Chun-hyang'.
A great title.

1:57:18.031 --> 1:57:22.576
And put in this scene.

1:57:35.673 --> 1:57:41.678
It's when the master
is really in love with her.

1:57:42.889 --> 1:57:48.393
He sings a song for her.

1:57:49.604 --> 1:57:55.859
Come here and I'll carry
you on my back.

1:57:59.822 --> 1:58:03.366
Come here

1:58:08.790 --> 1:58:12.084
I'm no good at singing, so...

1:58:15.588 --> 1:58:19.382
But you're
the hero ofthe tale.

1:58:20.134 --> 1:58:25.097
I don't care what kind of
role I play in the tale.

1:58:28.434 --> 1:58:30.602
I'm the hero in my heart.

1:58:35.316 --> 1:58:38.193
I'll try again properly.

1:58:40.988 --> 1:58:52.040
Come here and I'll carry you.

1:58:52.416 --> 1:59:10.350
You're my love,
my true love...
