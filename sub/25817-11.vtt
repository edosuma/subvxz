WEBVTT

00:11.345 --> 00:13.514
<i>I felt hungrier than ever.</i>

00:14.598 --> 00:16.850
<i>But it wasn't just my stomach
that felt empty.</i>

00:17.768 --> 00:21.230
<i>Nonnie had dumped me,
my mom ran off to who knows where,</i>

00:21.563 --> 00:25.108
<i>and Bob Armstrong hated me
for outing him and Bob Barnard.</i>

00:26.610 --> 00:27.986
<i>And who could blame him?</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:29.571
<i>I hated me too.</i>

00:30.405 --> 00:32.448
<i>I spent the last week hiding out,</i>

00:32.533 --> 00:35.911
<i>stuffing my face,
and already none of my pants fit.</i>

00:37.621 --> 00:41.124
<i>I knew food wasn't gonna fix my problems,
but what else could I do?</i>

00:47.673 --> 00:49.758
<i>And then I got my answer.</i>

00:50.842 --> 00:53.845
<i>Drew Barrymore was coming to Atlanta?</i>

00:54.137 --> 00:56.306
<i>It was divine intervention,</i>

00:56.807 --> 00:58.809
<i>like a sign from God herself.</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:03.480
<i>Drew wouldn't give up like a loser
and eat her way into oblivion.</i>

01:04.063 --> 01:06.400
<i>So, what would Drew Barrymore do?</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

01:15.284 --> 01:17.077
<i>She'd clean up her mess.</i>

01:17.369 --> 01:18.996
<i>Make amends for what she'd done.</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:22.207
<i>Like in </i> Never Been Kissed,
<i>when Drew writes that article</i>

01:22.291 --> 01:24.710
<i>telling everyone
Michael Vartan's not really a perv.</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:27.754
<i>But I couldn't start with Bob.</i>

01:28.338 --> 01:29.673
<i>He hated me the most.</i>

01:30.507 --> 01:32.426
<i>At least I didn't ruin Nonnie's life.</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:34.928
<i>I just hoped she would take my call.</i>

01:42.978 --> 01:47.024
You know that you picking me up from rehab
doesn't mean we're back together, right?

01:47.107 --> 01:47.983
Obviously.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.778
But I figure if I've got to go to dinner
with my dad and his new boyfriend,

01:51.862 --> 01:53.697
who better to do it with
than my ex-girlfriend

01:53.780 --> 01:55.198
whose dad's dating my dad?

01:58.869 --> 02:00.370
Were you mad when you found out?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.664
I was furious.

02:02.748 --> 02:06.251
But now, I have compassion for him.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.880
You know? It must've been tough,
keeping that side of himself

02:09.963 --> 02:11.506
hidden for so long.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.634
I wish I could be that compassionate.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.677
My mom hasn't left the house
since they got outed.

02:16.219 --> 02:19.848
Plus, I just keep on picturing it,
you know, your dad on top of my dad,

02:19.931 --> 02:23.101
- my dad on top of your dad...
- Okay, maybe I should have taken an Uber.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.608
Hey. Magnolia and Brick
are already on their way.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.694
You are gonna put on a shirt
before they get here, right?

02:32.778 --> 02:35.572
Of course. Just didn't wanna get grease
on my clothes.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.408
Relax, it'll all be fine.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.370
How...? How do you know?

02:41.453 --> 02:44.247
We've just been hiding out here
since Patty outed us.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.417
Dodging the stares, avoiding reality.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.044
Ain't it been kind of nice?

02:49.419 --> 02:50.837
Like a honeymoon?

02:50.921 --> 02:54.174
I mean, Etta Mae agreed to the divorce,
so we can finally be ourselves.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.928
Speak for yourself.
I don't even know that this is who I am.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.055
Come on, you going back
to thinking you're not gay?

03:00.138 --> 03:02.099
I... I feel like a lesbian, Bob.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.518
We moved in together after a week.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.104
I don't know, you... You and I,

03:07.187 --> 03:09.272
in this house, living like this,

03:09.356 --> 03:10.941
I didn't choose it.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.317
- Patty did.
- Look.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.946
You can move forward
if you just let yourself.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.241
Maybe smoothing things over
with Brick's a good start.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.412
Okay? Here we go.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.374
- Shirt!
- Oh, right.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.006
So, Brick...

03:36.133 --> 03:39.094
we made your favorite, pork chops.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.681
I haven't had pork since my buddy Andy
got a pet pig a year ago.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.977
Well, I can make you something else.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.520
It's fine. I'm barely hungry.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.523
Sorry, Brick, I'm trying. I'm nervous.

03:51.606 --> 03:54.234
I don't... I don't know
how to act around you guys.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.446
It's okay, Bob. Just be yourself.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.197
Yeah, a cheater and a liar.

03:59.489 --> 04:04.035
All right, Brick. I know it is strange
to see me with a man.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.954
Trust me, it is a surprise for me too.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.372
Then you're the only one.

04:07.873 --> 04:11.877
Dad, you are a man obsessed with shoes
and purses. Big shock, you're gay.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.378
- I'm bi.
- Whatever.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.298
Gay, bi, straight, trans. That is fine.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.966
What's not fine is the two of you
deciding to break up two families

04:19.050 --> 04:19.885
like it's nothing.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.262
- Okay, Brick, easy.
- I don't think I was talking to you.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.765
All right, Brick, please be respectful.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.183
You know what? I can't do this.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.520
Bob, you tried. He just needs some time.
You've got to let him go.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.483
So...

04:35.609 --> 04:37.027
you still eat pork, right?

04:45.869 --> 04:48.955
How the hell did you get in here?
I changed the locks.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.708
The spare's still under the doormat.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.170
Well, aren't you a regular
Sherlock homosexual?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.091
- Please leave.
- Have you seen Brick?

05:00.884 --> 05:02.344
He and I were about to have dinner.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.262
It did not go well, and I just wanna talk.

05:04.346 --> 05:07.432
- He's not here.
- Well, his car is outside.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.476
Well, maybe he went for a run.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.437
But it sounds like
he doesn't wanna talk to you, Bob.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.232
And quite frankly,
neither do I, so please go.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.819
Coralee, we need to be able
to talk about our son.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.196
Okay, I am filing for a divorce, Bob.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.532
No.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.453
- I don't want a divorce.
- What did you think was gonna happen?

05:28.537 --> 05:31.873
Did you think that we were gonna
stay married even though you're gay?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.625
I'm not gay, I'm bi.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.460
You are Brokeback, Bob.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.797
Two gay men, married to women,

05:38.880 --> 05:42.008
thinking about each other while sleeping
with your unsuspecting wives.

05:42.092 --> 05:46.221
That is not true.
We both love sex with women.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.307
Even though he says he's gay,
which makes no sense to me at all...

05:49.391 --> 05:50.892
Because it's bullshit!

05:50.976 --> 05:52.853
Okay? It is bullshit.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.651
Our entire marriage has been a lie.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.152
That's not true.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.529
I love you.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.282
No, no. No, no, no.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.784
Don't you say that to me.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.954
You don't ever get
to say that to me again.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.374
You are still the sexiest woman
I've ever seen,

06:14.457 --> 06:17.586
but there is this whole other part of me

06:17.669 --> 06:20.005
- that I didn't even know…
- Oh, okay, okay. You know what?

06:20.088 --> 06:23.216
Go be sexually confused
in someone else's kitchen.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.261
Like maybe your boyfriend's.

06:26.511 --> 06:30.974
Coralee, I was willing to give you
the space to work through your stuff.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.643
- Can't you do that for me?
- No, I... I... No.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.606
Not about this.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.817
Leave the key on the counter.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.655
I am done.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.085
<i>When Nonnie
wouldn't take my calls,</i>

06:59.169 --> 07:01.046
<i>I got Choi to help me track her down.</i>

07:02.547 --> 07:03.548
Hey, Patty.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.843
You haven't been in school,
haven't been answering my calls or texts.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.678
- I was worried about you.
- Don't be.

07:09.429 --> 07:13.224
And not answering your calls and texts
is a hint that I don't wanna talk to you.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.687
Please let me make it up to you.
I... got you a birthday present.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.524
Have you just been, like,
carrying that around with you?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.653
How did you know I was gonna be here?

07:25.487 --> 07:27.697
- Are you stalking me?
- Come on, just take it.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.575
- Take it.
- I don't wanna take anything from you.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.410
Please, just leave me alone.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.084
<i>I should have been worried
that I had a stalker,</i>

07:39.167 --> 07:42.295
<i>but I was more worried
about fixing things with my best friend.</i>

07:46.132 --> 07:47.175
Hey.

07:47.759 --> 07:48.969
Hey, Patty.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.262
Fancy meeting you here!

07:54.140 --> 07:56.601
Choi, did you set me up?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.938
All right, I'm sorry. I think it's weird
you guys aren't friends anymore.

08:00.438 --> 08:04.359
You're like peanut butter and jelly,
or Charlie Manson and Sharon Tate,

08:04.442 --> 08:06.945
- or Jerry Lewis and...
- Okay, Choi.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.780
- We get it.
- ...Dean Martin.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.658
Um, look, I brought you a peace offering.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.660
I don't know if you heard, but,

08:14.244 --> 08:17.372
Drew Barrymore is coming into town
to sign her newest book.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.750
And I realized that seeing her
wouldn't mean anything without you.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.377
So, I got us tickets.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.629
You really don't get it, do you?

08:26.047 --> 08:27.841
I told you I needed a break,

08:28.299 --> 08:31.177
which means it's up to me to decide
when that break is over.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.178
Not you.

08:33.221 --> 08:36.265
And for the record,
I don't even like Drew anymore.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.559
I like Charlize Theron now.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.527
Sorry. Anything I can do?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.154
Coralee.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.241
<i>No, but there was something
I could do.</i>

08:53.324 --> 08:55.493
Coralee. Half a dozen hard,
half a dozen soft,

08:55.577 --> 08:56.828
two wet tods,

08:57.120 --> 09:00.373
one wien rings,
two fudgy wieners, and Diet Coke.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.042
It's not all for me.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.671
Coralee, can we talk?

09:07.505 --> 09:10.467
See? I have a friend joining me.
Get over here.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.931
I really wanna make amends
for what I did.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.100
I wanna find a way to make it up to you.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.645
Well, you could start
by eating half this food.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.689
You'd be saving me from myself.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.611
So, wait, you don't... like,
totally hate me?

09:30.528 --> 09:32.072
Well, I did hate you...

09:32.864 --> 09:35.033
for giving me the necklace
from Stella Rose,

09:35.116 --> 09:36.826
and for trying to steal Bob.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.913
Which I completely regret,
now more than ever.

09:39.996 --> 09:44.751
Well, obviously it doesn't matter
since he prefers wieners over tacos.

09:47.504 --> 09:52.008
I think you did me a favor, Patty,
by outing Bob.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.469
Well, I needed to know the truth,

09:54.552 --> 09:57.597
and now I can move on
with my life, you know?

09:57.680 --> 10:00.475
I'm just gonna drown my sorrows
in some wieners,

10:00.558 --> 10:03.812
and then maybe get
an investor for Tampazzle.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.231
- Tamp... whatzel?
- Tampazzle.

10:06.314 --> 10:10.568
It's a tampon with a tassel,
so you could pull it right out.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.404
Oh, my God, I would totally use that.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.866
I know, right?
And Bob totally didn't get it.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.746
I swear, losing Bob might be
the best thing that ever happened to me.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.207
Because now, I can be the me

10:24.290 --> 10:27.252
I always wanted to be
without Bob getting in the way.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.505
<i>At least one of us felt better off
without Bob.</i>

10:30.588 --> 10:32.549
And you can be too, Patty.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.342
<i>Did I say that out loud?</i>

10:34.425 --> 10:37.053
You are smart.
You don't need Bob pushing you around,

10:37.137 --> 10:39.264
and you certainly don't need pageants.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.431
Except I do.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.726
I've been smart my whole life,
I've gotten straight A's.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.647
But nobody's dying to take
the valedictorian to prom.

10:49.232 --> 10:53.069
I just wanna know
what it feels like to be beautiful.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.532
You are beautiful.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.867
I don't feel it.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.077
I got thin.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.789
I got thin, I got a boyfriend,
I got new friends...

11:05.832 --> 11:07.876
and I still feel like a loser.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.127
Oh, honey.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.962
I just keep thinking that if...

11:11.045 --> 11:14.048
If I could get up there,
on that stage with those girls,

11:14.257 --> 11:15.925
and if I could win that crown...

11:16.885 --> 11:19.512
then maybe I would feel like...

11:21.723 --> 11:23.183
I was finally enough.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.105
I get it. You want the brass ring.

11:29.564 --> 11:30.523
The validation.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.108
Yeah.

11:32.609 --> 11:36.154
But now I'll never get it. I mean,
I've just been sitting and binging.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.449
Regionals is a week away.
I would have to lose ten pounds.

11:39.532 --> 11:44.621
Well, fortunately for you, I know someone
who's an expert at losing weight fast.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.292
Yeah, wrestlers sometimes have to lose
ten pounds in two days

11:49.375 --> 11:51.878
to make their weight class,
so I know all the tricks.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.755
This next week's about
sweating and starving.

11:53.838 --> 11:57.008
Let's get some mileage in
before the Ex-Lax kicks in, yeah?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.681
Speaking of shitty,

12:04.515 --> 12:07.560
I wanted to apologize
for how I treated you.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.480
- It's fine. You don't have to.
- I do.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.358
You're being so helpful, and...

12:14.150 --> 12:16.486
- I was kind of an asshole to you.
- Oh, kind of?

12:17.278 --> 12:20.406
You know, you broke up with me,
you didn't listen to me about Christian,

12:20.490 --> 12:21.824
you outed my dad.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.535
Okay. Definitely an asshole.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.249
Look, you told the truth about my dad,
so you kind of did me a solid,

12:29.332 --> 12:31.626
and I've done some
messed up things, you know?

12:31.709 --> 12:34.337
Cheated on Magnolia, slept with Regina.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.340
Plus, I'm enjoying watching you suffer.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.343
So, come on. Let's pick up the pace.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.182
Hey, good morning. How'd you sleep?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.269
- Not great.
- Yeah, well, me neither.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.604
Bob didn't come home last night.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.732
- He was probably out looking for Brick.
- Yeah.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.026
Well, still, he could have called.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.237
Why didn't you sleep well?

12:59.487 --> 13:01.823
First night at home in a new old bed?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.826
No. I was thinking about Roxy.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.245
You were? What about her?

13:07.328 --> 13:10.623
I feel bad that she's spent all this time
with no father.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.002
I think you need to reach out.
Clear the air.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.421
We should go talk to her together.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.511
Well, thank God you're all right.
I thought you were dead in a ditch.

13:23.594 --> 13:27.682
- Okay, weird. You sound like Mom.
- Sorry, I was out driving around.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.101
All night?

13:30.184 --> 13:32.145
Coralee wants a divorce.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.357
I'll let you guys... talk.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.984
Yeah. Thank you, darling.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.110
Hey, come on, have a seat.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.571
What's going on? What happened?

13:41.654 --> 13:44.240
It was... It was horrible. She's furious.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.909
She thinks our whole marriage was a sham.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.495
Well... on the bright side,

13:49.579 --> 13:52.707
at least we can be together now
without any guilt.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.334
Except, I don't want a divorce.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.251
You...

13:58.880 --> 14:00.173
So, what are you saying?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.549
You wanna get back with her?

14:01.632 --> 14:02.884
No, that's not what I'm saying.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.135
Really? Because honestly, Bob,

14:04.218 --> 14:06.346
it sounds like the opposite
of moving forward.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.806
I just thought maybe
there was a way that everything

14:08.890 --> 14:10.850
- could work out somehow.
- You did, how?

14:11.392 --> 14:14.145
You think it's gonna be some kind
of shared custody agreement?

14:14.228 --> 14:16.272
- A week with me, a week with her?
- I don't know.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.149
- No, you're in denial, Bob.
- Of what?

14:18.232 --> 14:19.108
Of reality.

14:20.151 --> 14:20.985
You...

14:21.361 --> 14:24.447
You need to start grieving
the loss of your old life.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.536
<i>Maybe I did need to grieve.</i>

14:30.620 --> 14:32.622
<i>I did feel like a part of me had died...</i>

14:33.623 --> 14:37.877
<i>murdered by the hands
of my former protégé, Patty Bladell.</i>

14:38.503 --> 14:41.172
<i>Brick and I had been doing
two-a-days all week,</i>

14:41.255 --> 14:42.757
<i>and I was already feeling stronger.</i>

14:42.840 --> 14:44.675
Okay, stop. I gotta stop.
Sorry, I need a break.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.177
Yeah, okay, here. Uh...

14:48.513 --> 14:50.890
- Drink this.
- What's in it anyway?

14:50.973 --> 14:53.643
Uh, lime juice, cayenne pepper,
maple syrup, raw egg,

14:53.726 --> 14:54.811
- All-Bran...
- Sorry I asked.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.525
Yeah.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.571
Is that Christian's car?

15:12.870 --> 15:16.165
- Are you following me?
- No, I just pulled over to send a text.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.376
You just happened to be
on the street where I'm running.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.003
Or you just happened to be
on the street where I'm parked.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.131
- Maybe it's fate.
- I don't believe in fate.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.258
- What the hell's going on?
- Christian's stalking me.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.679
Whoa, easy, Vanilla Ice.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.395
Get the hell out of here
or I'm calling the cops!

15:37.478 --> 15:38.980
- The cops? You attacked me.
- Yeah.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.149
And it'll be a lot worse
if you come near Patty again.

15:41.232 --> 15:45.111
So get in your car, drive away,
and don't come back!

15:45.194 --> 15:47.405
Okay, okay. I'll go.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.877
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, now.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.087
- We should call the cops.
- No. No, no, no.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.047
I mean, he's right,
you attacked him first.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.966
Besides, I think he got the message.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.427
Your mom's out of town,
so if he shows up again, call me.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.555
We got another mile, so, let's go.

16:17.852 --> 16:20.813
So, does this mean you're my real dad?

16:21.355 --> 16:22.940
Stella Rose said my real dad died.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.776
Well, she lied, because I asked her to.

16:26.402 --> 16:30.781
I was more worried about my image
than telling the truth.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.116
Why change your mind now?

16:32.950 --> 16:34.160
He's gay.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.289
- I don't understand what that…
- Look, I recently came out.

16:38.831 --> 16:43.127
And now, I'm trying to live a more honest
and open life about everything.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.796
And I realize I did a lot of damage

16:45.880 --> 16:48.633
when I was pretending to be
someone I wasn't.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.928
And now I truly am trying to make amends,

16:52.512 --> 16:54.180
to both of my daughters.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.682
And I'd really love
to get to know my sister.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.352
- So you're doing this for you.
- What? No.

16:59.727 --> 17:03.439
No, we're doing this for us.
For our family.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.443
You're not my family.
I don't have a family.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.403
I went from foster home to foster home,

17:09.487 --> 17:12.365
just trying to get by
with no idea where I belonged.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.742
You... You abandoned me.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.537
And this is the first time
I've heard from you,

17:17.619 --> 17:21.123
so do me a favor,
and let it be the last.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.468
Hey, what are you doing?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.597
The movers picked up my stuff
from Coralee's today.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.976
I, uh... I put most of it in storage,
but there are a few boxes I...

17:41.602 --> 17:43.104
I wanted to go through.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.192
Look...

17:49.819 --> 17:51.153
If you wanna go back...

17:51.737 --> 17:52.697
I don't.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.033
I need to move forward, like you said.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.661
I just feel guilty.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.581
Brick was right, we broke up two families.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.624
You did the best you could...

18:04.417 --> 18:06.502
to protect your family. We both did.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.506
I saw Roxy today.

18:11.716 --> 18:12.758
And how did that go?

18:14.594 --> 18:15.803
Didn't go well.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.809
Oh, look at us.
We're supposed to be happy.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.603
Gay!

18:26.188 --> 18:27.023
Okay.

18:27.982 --> 18:28.858
Whoo!

18:28.941 --> 18:30.693
We need to shake off this bad mood.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.113
I have an idea.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.917
I feel so much better.

18:47.501 --> 18:52.506
Whoo! Feels so good to finally introduce
hashtag "BarnStrong" to the world.

18:54.717 --> 18:55.551
Lick it.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.220
You'll like it.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.808
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm... I'm with someone.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.523
I don't... I don't think this is my scene.

19:09.607 --> 19:13.986
Oh, come on, Bob, loosen up.
Let your rainbow flag fly.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.071
Whoo!

19:15.529 --> 19:17.281
I'm not sure those are my colors.

19:24.163 --> 19:24.997
Guys, I'm...

19:25.414 --> 19:28.209
This isn't... This is dry clean only!

19:30.920 --> 19:32.463
Yeah, Daddy, take it off!

19:32.546 --> 19:34.256
Take it all off!

19:35.174 --> 19:36.300
That's not what... I mean...

19:45.518 --> 19:48.979
It was one place on one night.
You can't judge it just by that.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.898
I told you, I am not like you.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.484
- Those aren't my people.
- But I'm your people.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.154
Look, there's plenty of other things
we can do as a gay couple

19:57.238 --> 19:59.990
that don't involve go-go boys
and strobe lights.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.743
Just... just stay open, hun.

20:03.035 --> 20:07.039
Might take some negotiation,
but we can figure it out.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.544
What the fuck?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.380
No, no, no.

20:14.463 --> 20:18.259
What if one of those big, beefy bear men
followed us home

20:18.467 --> 20:20.803
to try and force us to devil taint them?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.054
A boy can dream.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.061
Oh, I'm sorry.
I knocked over your garbage.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.647
Roxy, what are you doing here?

20:31.731 --> 20:34.316
I confronted Stella Rose.
I asked her about why she lied.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.401
Come on, come in.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.114
She told me that
you paid her off to keep her quiet.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.492
She could've used that money to take care
of me, so why give me up for adoption?

20:43.576 --> 20:46.579
Like, what kind of person
does something like that?

20:46.662 --> 20:48.205
All right. Hey, come here.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.541
I was so hurt, I just started driving.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.673
Do you like peach or lemon zinger tea?

21:00.968 --> 21:05.139
<i>I was actually starting to think
I could win regionals without Bob.</i>

21:05.222 --> 21:09.018
<i>I was feeling strong,
independent, fearless.</i>

21:12.229 --> 21:13.606
<i>So much for fearless.</i>

21:15.441 --> 21:16.734
Oh, my God!

21:20.946 --> 21:22.740
Thanks again for giving up your room.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.159
- I feel safer already.
- Yeah, I...

21:25.659 --> 21:27.244
I was glad you called. I mean, clearly,

21:27.578 --> 21:30.956
Christian did not get the message,
so... take this.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.793
My mom got it after she took
a self-defense class, and…

21:35.252 --> 21:37.713
Yeah, one zap of this
would knock his ass out for 30 minutes.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.174
Thank you.
I will sleep with it under my pillow.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.676
Uh, just don't accidentally zap yourself.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.304
Or me.
I did it once, it wasn't pretty, so...

21:45.387 --> 21:47.181
Uh, there's extra towels in the bathroom,

21:47.264 --> 21:49.725
and me and my mom
will both be downstairs if you need us,

21:49.809 --> 21:51.352
so just call.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.313
Brick, wait.

21:55.022 --> 21:58.234
Could you, like, maybe
stay the night with me?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.693
Just as a friend.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.946
I'm just...
I'm still feeling kind of spooked.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.989
Yeah. Whatever you need.

22:08.828 --> 22:09.662
Thanks.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.132
Actually, there is one more thing I need.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.389
Would you possibly want to...

22:29.014 --> 22:31.767
go to a Drew Barrymore book signing
with me tomorrow night?

22:32.226 --> 22:34.895
I just... I've admired her forever.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.606
It's gonna be like a big deal for me,

22:37.690 --> 22:40.484
and... I would love it
if you could be there.

22:40.568 --> 22:41.485
I mean, if you're free.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.321
Sure. It's a date.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.741
<i>I was finally feeling lighter,</i>

22:48.117 --> 22:51.245
<i>and it wasn't just because
I got back down to my fighting weight.</i>

22:51.328 --> 22:53.956
<i>I had made things right
with Brick and Coralee.</i>

22:54.498 --> 22:57.835
<i>But there was still one Armstrong
to whom I owed an apology.</i>

23:03.382 --> 23:06.594
Okay. I got towels in the guest bathroom,

23:06.677 --> 23:08.262
fresh sheets on the bed.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.973
Is there anything else you need?

23:11.849 --> 23:14.184
Not unless you can pay off
the regionals board too.

23:14.268 --> 23:15.603
Pay 'em off? What do you mean?

23:15.686 --> 23:17.396
Look at me, I'm a mess.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.815
There's no way I can win
without Stella Rose coaching me.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.568
I don't know how to talk,
I don't know how to dress.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.279
Stella Rose had me doing
all that rodeo crap and…

23:25.696 --> 23:26.906
We can help you.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.367
- Really?
- Wait, we?

23:30.451 --> 23:34.371
I was thinking
we could coach Roxy together.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.167
No strobe lights, no go-go boys.

23:39.126 --> 23:39.960
What do you think?

23:47.384 --> 23:51.388
<i>It had felt good to have Brick
protecting me from my psycho ex-boyfriend,</i>

23:51.639 --> 23:54.308
<i>but now, I had to be brave on my own.</i>

24:01.106 --> 24:01.982
Hi, Bob.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.986
- Get out... or I'll call security.
- No, wait.

24:06.070 --> 24:08.322
Wait, wait, wait.
Can we...? Can we talk?

24:09.615 --> 24:10.574
About what?

24:11.742 --> 24:13.994
About you ruining my reputation? Hmm?

24:14.328 --> 24:17.414
About you destroying my family?

24:17.790 --> 24:22.336
Or about you robbing me
of any choice I had

24:22.419 --> 24:24.380
in a very confusing,

24:24.463 --> 24:28.717
very complicated, very personal matter?!

24:30.928 --> 24:32.680
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.768
You know what? It's fine.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.687
You've freed me

24:40.187 --> 24:44.274
to work with a real beauty queen,
who's a winner.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.111
Wha...?

24:48.445 --> 24:49.321
What do you mean?

24:50.239 --> 24:51.657
I'm coaching Roxy.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.454
Now leave.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.003
<i>Maybe it was crazy to think</i>

25:04.086 --> 25:07.923
<i>that after everything I had done,
Bob would just forgive me.</i>

25:08.507 --> 25:12.678
<i>But from the moment I met him,
I just knew we were connected.</i>

25:13.679 --> 25:15.514
<i>I couldn't believe it was over.</i>

25:16.098 --> 25:18.142
<i>This wasn't how it was supposed to end.</i>

25:20.644 --> 25:21.520
There you go.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.230
Oh, babe!

25:23.731 --> 25:27.943
Roxy and I came up
with the most genius idea.

25:28.027 --> 25:32.448
What do you think about Roxy
as the face of CACA?

25:35.701 --> 25:38.037
Your charity.
The Center for Anal Cancer Awareness.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.164
She needs a new platform.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.085
Hello, Bob, what is wrong with you?
This is a fantastic idea.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.046
Patty came to see me at the office.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.049
- Uh-oh. Well, how'd that go?
- Not well.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.719
I said some horrible things,
things I knew would hurt her.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.721
- Understandable.
- No, I don't know.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.265
Doesn't that make me just as bad as her?

25:58.348 --> 26:02.102
If I could just snap
and lash out like that,

26:02.186 --> 26:03.896
then maybe I could understand why she…

26:03.979 --> 26:06.273
Hang on. You're not thinking
about forgiving her, are you?

26:06.356 --> 26:07.191
No.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.737
I don't know. We just...

26:12.946 --> 26:14.156
went through a lot together.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.493
So did Hitler and Mussolini,
and look how that turned out.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.745
Forget about Patty,

26:20.120 --> 26:21.538
focus on Roxy.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.960
<i>Maybe Bob was right.</i>

26:27.461 --> 26:30.547
<i>Maybe I had to mourn the loss
of my relationship with Patty too.</i>

26:33.717 --> 26:36.845
<i>I couldn't believe
Bob had replaced me so quickly.</i>

26:37.096 --> 26:39.389
<i>And with Roxy? My biggest rival?</i>

26:39.932 --> 26:43.685
<i>She was already the perfect pageant girl,
and now she had the perfect coach.</i>

26:44.019 --> 26:45.521
<i>I'd never win regionals now.</i>

26:45.771 --> 26:46.605
Patty?

26:47.397 --> 26:48.982
What are you doing here?

26:49.316 --> 26:52.444
I'm staying here
while my mom is out of town.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.196
What the hell are you doing here?

26:54.947 --> 26:56.323
Waiting for Coralee.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.368
I came up with an amazing
business plan for Tampazzle,

26:59.451 --> 27:02.663
but she won't take my calls,
so I used the key under the mat.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.164
That's breaking and entering.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.959
No, it's determination.

27:07.709 --> 27:11.421
I want in on this tampon action,
and I won't take no for an answer.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.591
You're insane.
Coralee will never go for it.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.803
- You seduced Brick. You accused Bob…
- Hey, hey, hey.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.805
We all know what I did,

27:20.389 --> 27:22.391
and I paid dearly for my sins.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.809
But I wanna make it up to Coralee,

27:23.892 --> 27:25.519
and the best way to do that
is to help her.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.771
I have contacts, I can find investors,

27:28.188 --> 27:30.149
pull some strings, so to speak.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.152
- Ew.
- Plus, I have a ton of great ideas.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.320
Yeah, you're a real font of inspiration.

27:35.404 --> 27:38.073
Was it your idea to have Dixie
fake being in a wheelchair?

27:39.491 --> 27:40.993
Yes! Ergh!

27:41.076 --> 27:43.787
And it would have worked too,
if Dixie had a higher pain threshold.

27:44.329 --> 27:48.417
We would have ruined your reputation
and had the greatest comeback story ever.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.462
Oh, adopted pageant girl
miraculously learns to walk again.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.673
Do you even know where she is?
Do you care?

27:54.756 --> 27:55.966
Of course I care!

27:56.258 --> 27:59.636
But she drove away with my house,
and now she won't return my calls,

27:59.720 --> 28:02.014
so I'm looking out for number one.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.265
Me.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.268
You mean by lying,
or hurting anyone who gets in your way?

28:06.643 --> 28:09.855
Don't you get on your high horse with me,
Patty Bladell.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.982
You blew up Bob's life.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.903
Oh, you done some terrible things
to get what you want.

28:16.862 --> 28:22.326
Seems to me like every time
you try to do the right thing,

28:22.868 --> 28:25.162
it bites you in the ass.

28:26.663 --> 28:27.706
Face it, Patty.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.792
Integrity is for pussies.

28:30.876 --> 28:35.923
That's why I gave it up a long time ago.
Winners win. Period.

28:36.006 --> 28:37.799
Oh.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.134
Oh, my God, write that down.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.928
Oh, that is a great slogan!

28:41.303 --> 28:44.348
Regina... get out of the house,
or I'll call the cops.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.643
Fine. But leave this for Coralee.
It's my business plan.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.394
Whatever, sure.

28:49.478 --> 28:53.315
Oh, oh, tell her I tried out her prototype
and it works great. You wanna see?

28:53.398 --> 28:55.150
- Regina, no. Out.
- A little peak?

28:55.234 --> 28:56.818
- Now.
- I showed you!

28:56.902 --> 28:58.278
Can't unsee that.

28:58.654 --> 28:59.696
Bye, Felicia.

29:00.864 --> 29:04.409
<i>Regina was crazy,
but could she also be right?</i>

29:04.910 --> 29:06.995
<i>Maybe integrity was for pussies.</i>

29:07.329 --> 29:09.831
<i>I had done the right thing,
like Drew would do,</i>

29:09.915 --> 29:11.583
<i>and it had bit me in the ass.</i>

29:12.000 --> 29:15.045
<i>Nonnie rejected me, Bob pushed me away.</i>

29:15.420 --> 29:18.423
<i>All I had left was regionals,
and I needed to win.</i>

29:19.132 --> 29:21.843
<i>So, what would Regina Sinclair do?</i>

29:29.893 --> 29:32.562
<i>She'd take Roxy out.</i>

29:34.022 --> 29:37.109
<i>I couldn't kill her, of course,
that would be crazy.</i>

29:37.901 --> 29:42.155
<i>But if Roxy was the only thing
standing in my way of winning regionals,</i>

29:42.239 --> 29:44.366
<i>I had to make sure she didn't show up.</i>

29:46.326 --> 29:48.787
<i>Maybe I was light-headed
from not eating in days,</i>

29:48.870 --> 29:51.248
<i>or delirious from the sweating
and laxatives,</i>

29:51.331 --> 29:54.126
<i>but my plan felt divinely inspired.</i>

29:54.751 --> 29:58.922
<i>I would just borrow the Ween-Mobile,
follow Roxy until she was alone,</i>

29:59.006 --> 30:02.134
<i>lure her into the truck,
drive her into the outskirts of town,</i>

30:02.217 --> 30:04.136
<i>and leave her there
until regionals were over.</i>

30:05.470 --> 30:07.639
<i>And then I'd just let her go.</i>

30:08.265 --> 30:09.558
<i>No harm, no foul.</i>

30:10.851 --> 30:13.562
<i>I just had to figure out a way
to disguise myself</i>

30:13.645 --> 30:15.981
<i>so Roxy couldn't finger me
once I set her free.</i>

30:28.702 --> 30:30.871
This is impressive work, Coralee.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.707
I had no idea
you had such a mind for business.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.960
Well, my daddy ran his own business,
as you know,

30:37.044 --> 30:39.504
so I guess I just
picked up a thing or two.

30:39.796 --> 30:43.467
And this Tampazzle idea...
you came up with it yourself?

30:43.759 --> 30:45.052
Oh, absolutely.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.637
I realized there was a hole
in the marketplace,

30:47.721 --> 30:49.389
and I had the perfect way to plug it.

30:54.227 --> 30:57.230
They come in different sizes
depending on how big…

30:57.314 --> 30:59.941
Oh, there's really no need
to go through all that.

31:00.025 --> 31:00.859
Oh, okay.

31:00.942 --> 31:04.029
Besides, I'm more interested
in helping you make a name for yourself,

31:04.446 --> 31:05.489
without Bob.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.700
You're not the only one he humiliated.

31:09.409 --> 31:13.622
I've spent a lot of time dealing
with comments from clients about...

31:14.873 --> 31:16.124
my son, the pansy.

31:16.875 --> 31:17.876
But this...

31:19.086 --> 31:20.879
this is a whole 'nother level.

31:21.338 --> 31:25.008
Not to mention the fact that
I signed the company over to Bob Barnard,

31:25.717 --> 31:28.387
only to find out that
he's a fudge-packing flame-thrower too.

31:28.762 --> 31:29.805
Okay, you know what?

31:29.888 --> 31:32.182
There's no reason for homophobic language.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.226
You're defending him,
after what he did to you?

31:34.309 --> 31:35.727
Well, no. I just...

31:35.811 --> 31:38.605
I'm not comfortable
with those kinds of slurs.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.399
You'd better cut
that liberal snowflake talk

31:40.482 --> 31:42.818
before I set you up
on meetings with investors.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.528
You know my client list.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.571
Big Tobacco, Big Oil,

31:46.822 --> 31:49.366
- the NRA, the KKK.
- The KKK?

31:49.449 --> 31:51.910
That's who you want
to invest in Tampazzle?

31:51.993 --> 31:53.703
They love tampons.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.039
They're white.

31:56.123 --> 31:59.543
Besides, they've been looking for a way
to tap into the female market

31:59.626 --> 32:01.086
to rehabilitate their image.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.004
Uh, yeah, but it feels like

32:03.088 --> 32:06.591
then I would be
supporting their cause by proxy.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.468
It feels like blood money.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.220
Apropos, don't you think?

32:11.555 --> 32:14.891
Uh, it's still one step too far.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.227
Well, suit yourself.

32:18.228 --> 32:20.397
But I do hope you've got
a good divorce attorney,

32:20.480 --> 32:22.858
because the only other way
you're gonna get that seed money

32:22.941 --> 32:26.611
is to take that brownie-banging
son of mine for everything he's worth.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.950
Here we go.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.957
My dad is coming out of retirement

32:39.040 --> 32:41.042
to represent Coralee in the divorce.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.502
Oh.

32:43.587 --> 32:44.629
I'm sorry.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.257
I was married to her for 20 years.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.594
I'm the father of her children,
and this is how she's treating me.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.971
- Well, she's hurting.
- Yeah, so am I.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.390
It's like a part of me died.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.475
'Cause it did.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.102
You've been grieving.

32:59.769 --> 33:00.770
Look, hey.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.398
You've been through denial...

33:04.441 --> 33:06.985
you're going through anger,
you're depressed.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.488
This is good.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.449
How do you figure?

33:12.532 --> 33:14.910
Because, honey, what's next is hope.

33:17.621 --> 33:18.997
Forgive me if I'm not convinced.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.166
I'm going to the office to do some work,

33:21.791 --> 33:23.084
clear my head.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.061
Oh, God.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.021
Whoo!

33:44.397 --> 33:47.734
Oh! Bed, bed, bed, bed,
bed, bed, bed, bed!

34:08.838 --> 34:09.922
Ooh!

34:10.340 --> 34:11.675
Something for Patty.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.342
Okay.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.096
"Dear Patty.

34:16.429 --> 34:17.429
I love you.

34:17.847 --> 34:20.058
I see the real you,

34:20.141 --> 34:22.351
and I'm never letting you go.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.728
Love, Christian."

34:24.813 --> 34:29.192
Okay, well, wordsmith you ain't,
young Christian.

34:29.943 --> 34:30.944
Let's see.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.487
Okay.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.033
WWDBD?

34:39.578 --> 34:40.411
Well...

34:47.377 --> 34:49.588
Coralee, what...? What are you doing here?

34:49.670 --> 34:52.507
I got a text message
that there was an emergency.

34:53.049 --> 34:55.092
- I didn't send it.
- I did.

34:56.386 --> 34:59.347
You left your phone
while I was doing the dishes.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.313
Well, aren't you two
just a picture of domestic bliss.

35:06.396 --> 35:09.274
- We need a mediation.
- Then you should have called my attorney.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.235
I don't mean a legal mediation,
I mean a personal one.

35:13.528 --> 35:16.948
There has to be a way to figure this out,
find a way to be happy.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.992
Well, that is easy for you to say.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.952
You guys end up with everything,

35:21.286 --> 35:23.622
and I... I get nothing.

35:23.997 --> 35:25.999
I literally get nothing.

35:27.542 --> 35:31.379
Okay, Bob, your name is on the house,
it is on the car,

35:31.463 --> 35:32.839
it is on the bank accounts.

35:33.173 --> 35:37.594
I can't even pick up my theater tickets
without you being there at will call.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.888
So, you can have it all.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.642
- What?
- Just take it.

35:44.809 --> 35:45.977
The house, the money,

35:46.686 --> 35:47.604
whatever you want.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.275
I want you, Bob.

35:52.734 --> 35:53.818
That's what I want.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.782
None of this means anything
if you are not by my side.

36:02.077 --> 36:02.952
Coralee.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.164
I miss my husband.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.839
I miss my wife so much.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.428
I'm sorry, I should...

36:21.513 --> 36:22.347
I shouldn't be here.

36:23.807 --> 36:24.891
Bob. Bob, wait.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.398
I love you too.

36:34.025 --> 36:34.859
What?

36:36.069 --> 36:37.946
- Both of you.
- Bullshit!

36:38.029 --> 36:41.241
Look, can't you just
consider the possibility

36:41.324 --> 36:44.703
that I can feel this
for more than one person?

36:45.870 --> 36:48.832
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna make it easy on you.

36:50.583 --> 36:51.543
I started this...

36:53.878 --> 36:54.963
and I'm gonna end it.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.691
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to…

37:16.443 --> 37:17.277
No.

37:18.820 --> 37:19.738
It's okay.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.324
It's okay? What's okay?

37:24.200 --> 37:25.118
This.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.496
I thought I'd be jealous.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.332
You mean you're not?

37:33.126 --> 37:34.127
No, I am.

37:35.545 --> 37:36.463
Just not...

37:37.422 --> 37:38.882
not the way you think.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.823
I've wanted to do that for years.

38:05.241 --> 38:06.075
Me too.

38:08.620 --> 38:09.454
Well, then...

38:11.039 --> 38:13.917
maybe more is possible...

38:15.710 --> 38:16.586
than I thought.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.479
<i>This was either the best idea</i>

38:34.562 --> 38:36.523
<i>or the worst idea of my life.</i>

38:37.440 --> 38:41.152
<i>This was either the best idea
or the worst idea of my life.</i>

38:41.569 --> 38:43.530
<i>I had followed Roxy all night.</i>

38:43.738 --> 38:46.741
<i>From the Barnards,
to the tailor, to the gym.</i>

38:47.492 --> 38:51.579
<i>And I figured this close to regionals,
she'd be sweating it out till close.</i>

38:58.920 --> 38:59.921
Brick.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.089
What's up?

39:01.172 --> 39:04.717
Patty, where are you?
The line for Drew Barrymore is huge,

39:05.385 --> 39:06.886
and they're saying I can't save seats.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.848
Shit, I completely forgot.

39:10.557 --> 39:13.101
- She's saying she forgot.
- Who are you talking to?

39:13.184 --> 39:14.853
- Nonnie, she's here too.
- Give me the phone.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.523
What do you mean you forgot?
It's Drew Barrymore.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.233
I thought you were over her.

39:21.150 --> 39:21.985
I lied.

39:22.819 --> 39:26.239
I couldn't stop thinking about it
after we talked, or you.

39:27.448 --> 39:31.911
<i>I'm sorry for what I said.
Can our break be over now?</i>

39:32.412 --> 39:33.621
Totally. Save me a seat.

39:38.376 --> 39:42.338
<i>I wanted to meet Drew,
but I wanted to win regionals more.</i>

39:49.012 --> 39:49.846
<i>Hola.</i>

39:56.436 --> 39:57.353
Ah.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.105
Wh?

40:00.690 --> 40:02.317
What the f...?
