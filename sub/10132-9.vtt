where people sit in seats

07:24.319 --> 07:26.905
as big as sofas

07:24.319 --> 07:26.905
and eat shrimp cocktail.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.409
Okay, let's get

07:28.240 --> 07:30.409
out of this dump!

07:37.374 --> 07:39.334
Did you enjoy your dinner?

07:39.376 --> 07:41.253
Well, the liver wasn't bad.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.171
You had the chicken, sir.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.715
In that case, it was awful.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.263
First class is so rad.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.514
We had lobster

07:51.305 --> 07:53.514
and ice cream sundaes.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.808
What did you guys have?

07:54.849 --> 07:57.518
We had the

07:54.849 --> 07:57.518
liver-in-a-chicken-suit.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.271
Girls, come on.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.271
It's the pilot's birthday

07:59.313 --> 08:00.688
and they're gonna cut the cake.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.023
(both)

08:00.730 --> 08:02.023
Alright.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.902
Rebecca's a nice girl.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.321
Very pretty.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.114
You two would make

08:07.362 --> 08:09.114
a wonderful couple.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.616
Yeah, I've tried, pop.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.616
She just wants to be friends.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.995
She's one of those girls

08:11.658 --> 08:14.995
that...her career comes first.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.205
Hey, I understand

08:15.036 --> 08:17.205
that girls' lib stuff

08:17.247 --> 08:20.167
but, uh, you gotta tell

08:17.247 --> 08:20.167
'em who's boss.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.127
- I didn't hear that.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.127
- Good.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.046
Jesse, hold up Michelle.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.341
I wanna get a shot of her

08:25.088 --> 08:27.341
little junior pilot wings.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.925
Okay, here we go.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.428
Hey, man.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.763
Kid, can't you see

08:31.470 --> 08:33.763
I'm trying to work here?

08:33.805 --> 08:36.641
Smile, Michelle.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.601
Kitty.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.729
- Hey, hey, hey!

08:38.643 --> 08:41.729
- 'Oh, uh..'

08:41.771 --> 08:43.523
Sir, I'm really terribly sorry.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.025
Uh, she loves animals.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.361
Give me back my hair.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.446
Oh, it's okay, Michelle.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.781
Way to go, mister.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.781
Make a kid cry on Christmas.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.868
It's okay, Michelle. I'll sing

08:51.823 --> 08:54.868
your favorite little lullaby.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.244
Okay?

08:56.286 --> 08:58.872
♪ Tall and tan

08:56.286 --> 08:58.872
and young and lovely ♪

08:58.913 --> 09:00.207
Everyone sing.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.335
♪ The girl

09:00.248 --> 09:03.335

09:10.217 --> 09:13.220
Your attention, please,

09:10.217 --> 09:13.220
the captain has informed me

09:13.261 --> 09:15.930
there's a heavy snowstorm

09:13.261 --> 09:15.930
in the rocky mountain area

09:15.972 --> 09:18.641
so we will be making

09:15.972 --> 09:18.641
an unscheduled landing.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.352
- Aw.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.352
- What?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.437
Sorry if I bummed you out.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.528
Let's go, girls.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.528
Hurry up, hurry up.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.364
Daddy, daddy,

09:29.569 --> 09:32.364
we can't stay here!

09:32.406 --> 09:35.534
Don't worry, sweetheart.

09:32.406 --> 09:35.534
I'm sure we won't be here long.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.869
Ladies and gentlemen..

09:37.911 --> 09:40.163
Due to this totally

09:37.911 --> 09:40.163
incredible blizzard

09:40.205 --> 09:44.584
flight 411, that's us, will

09:40.205 --> 09:44.584
remain grounded until morning.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.295
- What?

09:44.625 --> 09:47.295
- What did you say?

09:47.337 --> 09:50.424
So let me be the first

09:47.337 --> 09:50.424
to wish you and yours

09:50.465 --> 09:52.509
a very merry Christmas.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.221
I spent months

09:54.635 --> 09:56.221
planning this reunion

09:56.263 --> 09:58.265
and now we're gonna miss it.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.809
We're gonna spend

09:58.306 --> 10:01.809
Christmas in an airport?

10:01.851 --> 10:04.979
I told you we never should

10:01.851 --> 10:04.979
have gone on this trip.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.482
Santa will never find us now.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.487
[instrumental music]

10:22.539 --> 10:24.832
Operator, if Santa's not listed

10:24.874 --> 10:26.585
then give me

10:24.874 --> 10:26.585
the number for Mrs. Claus.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.880
Hello?

10:30.922 --> 10:33.258
Hello?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.009
How rude.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.974
Somebody do something!

10:37.178 --> 10:40.974
I can't get Santa on the phone.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.767
He'll never find me here.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.604
I'll handle this.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.604
I know how to talk to kids.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.355
Come here, shrimp.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.358
Excuse me, uh..

10:50.400 --> 10:52.944
Is your tribe sitting here?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.362
Yeah. Why?

10:54.404 --> 10:57.574
Well, then I'm sitting

10:54.404 --> 10:57.574
wa-a-a-y over there.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.994
Jesse..

11:01.035 --> 11:03.413
Look at Rebecca over there.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.956
She looks miserable.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.791
Now's your chance.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.460
Pop, what are you

11:06.833 --> 11:08.460
talking about?

11:08.502 --> 11:10.670
She needs comforting.

11:10.711 --> 11:14.215
Times of crisis always

11:10.711 --> 11:14.215
bring people together.

11:14.257 --> 11:18.178
Trust me. I met your mother

11:14.257 --> 11:18.178
the day Elvis got drafted.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.557
Pop, that's taking advantage.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.392
I.. It might work.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.147
Hi, Becky, how you doing?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.274
Oh, I'm doing okay, Jess.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.900
It's just that

11:31.316 --> 11:32.900
moving to San Francisco

11:32.942 --> 11:34.777
has kind of made me homesick.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.196
I was really

11:34.819 --> 11:36.196
looking forward to spending

11:36.237 --> 11:38.072
Christmas with my family.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.368
Ten of us kids gathered

11:38.114 --> 11:41.368
around a big turkey.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.496
This was my year

11:41.409 --> 11:44.496
for a drumstick.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.164
Well, I'm sure my parents

11:44.538 --> 11:46.164
would like to think of you

11:46.206 --> 11:47.915
as part of my family.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.210
It's been so long

11:47.957 --> 11:50.210
since I've seen everyone.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.004
You know, my little brother says

11:50.251 --> 11:53.004
Janice has really blossomed.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.131
Oh, yeah?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.131
Is Janice your sister?

11:55.173 --> 11:57.217
No, my cow.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.011
I'm gonna call home

11:57.258 --> 12:00.011
again. Excuse me.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.598
What happened?

12:03.640 --> 12:05.099
She went to call her cow.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.228
Joey, where's the bag

12:06.643 --> 12:08.228
with the presents?

12:08.269 --> 12:10.313
I don't know.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.313
It hasn't come in yet.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.607
They lost the bag

12:10.355 --> 12:12.607
with the presents?

12:12.649 --> 12:16.236
- Joey, what are we gonna do?

12:12.649 --> 12:16.236
- Maybe we should look for it?

12:16.277 --> 12:19.155
You are so good under pressure.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.616
And tomorrow morning when

12:19.197 --> 12:21.616
you wake up, I guarantee you

12:21.658 --> 12:24.661
the roller skates

12:21.658 --> 12:24.661
you asked for will be here.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.329
How can you be sure?

12:26.371 --> 12:28.665
Rudolph, the red-nosed

12:26.371 --> 12:28.665
reindeer will find you..

12:29.790 --> 12:32.502
...because his nose

12:29.790 --> 12:32.502
is radar.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.380
All these years I thought

12:32.544 --> 12:35.380
it was just a headlight.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.842
Any luck finding the bag

12:38.007 --> 12:39.842
with the presents?

12:39.884 --> 12:40.968
Nothing yet.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.512
This is horrible.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.139
Daddy! Daddy! Good news.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.891
D.J. explained it.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.518
Santa will get here with

12:46.933 --> 12:48.518
the presents because

12:48.560 --> 12:50.604
Rudolph has red-nose radar.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.567
Uh, Stephanie,

12:52.188 --> 12:55.567
you know, red-nose radar

12:55.609 --> 12:58.403
does not always work

12:55.609 --> 12:58.403
in real heavy snow.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.406
Are you saying

12:58.445 --> 13:01.406
Santa's not coming?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.700
Well, if he doesn't

13:01.448 --> 13:03.700
make it here, I'm sure

13:03.742 --> 13:05.368
he'll find you

13:03.742 --> 13:05.368
in a couple of days.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.496
But it's not the same.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.496
It won't be Christmas morning.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.462
Dad, what were you thinking?

13:12.791 --> 13:15.462
I had her all cheered up

13:15.503 --> 13:17.046
and then you

13:15.503 --> 13:17.046
bum her out big time.

13:19.382 --> 13:22.677
D.J., I think you're

13:19.382 --> 13:22.677
old enough to hear the truth.

13:24.845 --> 13:28.182
The airline lost our bag

13:24.845 --> 13:28.182
with the Christmas presents.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.436
What? No presents? You mean

13:28.224 --> 13:31.436
they lost my new CD player?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.273
How did you know you were

13:33.313 --> 13:35.273
getting a CD player?

13:36.815 --> 13:39.527
Did I say "CD player?"

13:39.569 --> 13:42.363
Yes. That's exactly

13:39.569 --> 13:42.363
what you just said.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.199
Well, it doesn't matter.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.199
I'm not getting it anyway.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.451
Stephanie was right.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.161
We should've never

13:46.493 --> 13:48.161
gone on this trip.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.121
This is the worst

13:48.202 --> 13:50.121
Christmas ever.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.502
This is not going well.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.295
(Danny)

13:55.543 --> 13:57.295
'Any ideas?'

14:02.550 --> 14:04.511
Kitty.

14:09.641 --> 14:10.933
Ho, ho, ho.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.648
Santa Claus, you found me!

14:16.690 --> 14:18.650
Merry Christmas.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.569
(all)

14:18.692 --> 14:21.569
Merry Christmas!

14:21.611 --> 14:23.154
Who is that?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.781
Santa claus.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.284
Sit on my knee, Stephanie.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.537
You know my name.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.622
Well, I know

14:30.578 --> 14:32.622
when you're sleeping.

14:32.664 --> 14:33.832
I know when you're awake.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.250
I know if you've

14:33.873 --> 14:36.250
been bad or good.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.419
So why are you so surprised?

14:38.461 --> 14:41.464
I've tried so hard

14:38.461 --> 14:41.464
to be good this year.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.675
Well, I know that

14:41.506 --> 14:43.675
you've been cleaning your room

14:43.717 --> 14:45.259
and making your bed.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.636
Hospital corners.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.599
I also know that you ate

14:48.262 --> 14:51.599
that last slice of cold pizza

14:51.641 --> 14:54.185
that Joey

14:51.641 --> 14:54.185
was saving for breakfast.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.439
You<i> do</i> know everything.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.067
I also know that

14:58.481 --> 15:01.067
you've been very kind

15:01.108 --> 15:03.737
to your family and friends.

15:03.778 --> 15:07.198
Little girls like you make

15:03.778 --> 15:07.198
the world a lot better place.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.617
Come on, let's

15:07.240 --> 15:09.617
go see Santa Claus.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.536
Come here, little girl.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.788
Ho, ho, ho, Michelle.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.122
Ho, ho, Joey.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.877
No, michelle, that's not Joey.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.713
That's Santa Claus. See?

15:21.755 --> 15:23.130
It is Joey!

15:23.172 --> 15:26.676
Uh, no, no,

15:23.172 --> 15:26.676
I'm, I'm Santa Claus.

15:26.718 --> 15:30.263
Why, people all over the world

15:26.718 --> 15:30.263
come up to me and say

15:30.304 --> 15:33.099
"Aren't you Joey Gladstone?"

15:33.140 --> 15:35.017
What a mean trick!

15:35.059 --> 15:37.228
Oh, Stephanie, wait. Uh, um..

15:37.270 --> 15:39.188
Santa can't be

15:37.270 --> 15:39.188
everywhere at once.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.524
So Joey is one

15:39.230 --> 15:41.524
of Santa's helpers.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.318
I cover all the airports.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.697
No, you don't. And don't

15:44.360 --> 15:47.697
try to make me feel better.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.824
I'm going back

15:47.739 --> 15:49.824
to my phone booth.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.245
Poor kid.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.038
What a rotten Christmas.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.249
The presents are lost.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.876
I broke Stephanie's heart.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.879
The presents are lost.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.633
I won't see

16:04.338 --> 16:06.633
my family on Christmas..

16:06.674 --> 16:08.342
...or my cow.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.221
Did I mention

16:09.677 --> 16:12.221
the presents are lost?

16:13.514 --> 16:15.141
It's all my fault.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.393
If it wasn't for me, we'd be

16:15.182 --> 16:17.393
spending Christmas at home

16:17.435 --> 16:19.813
instead of in

16:17.435 --> 16:19.813
a baggage claim.

16:19.854 --> 16:22.941
What's the matter

16:19.854 --> 16:22.941
with you people?

16:22.982 --> 16:26.736
The first Christmas was

16:22.982 --> 16:26.736
in a manger, they did okay.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.363
I mean, so what if we're stuck

16:26.778 --> 16:29.363
in this crummy dump?

16:29.405 --> 16:33.075
Christmas isn't about, about

16:29.405 --> 16:33.075
presents or Santa Claus or cows.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.621
It's about a feeling.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.749
It's about, it's about people.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.626
It's about us forgetting

16:39.791 --> 16:41.626
about our problems

16:41.668 --> 16:43.920
and reaching out

16:41.668 --> 16:43.920
to help other people.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.299
Christmas doesn't have

16:45.755 --> 16:48.299
to happen in one certain place.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.051
It happens in our hearts.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.304
So, if you think about it

16:53.346 --> 16:55.014
we could have Christmas

16:53.346 --> 16:55.014
anywhere, I mean, even in a..

16:55.055 --> 16:56.891
...even in a baggage claim.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.396
D.J., what do

16:59.018 --> 17:02.396
you see right there?

17:02.438 --> 17:04.524
- 'Coat rack.'

17:02.438 --> 17:04.524
- No.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.318
I see a big,

17:04.565 --> 17:07.318

17:16.076 --> 17:19.163
Pop, what

17:16.076 --> 17:19.163
do you see back there?

17:19.205 --> 17:21.165
- Conveyer belt.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.165
- No.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.416
I see..

17:22.458 --> 17:25.336
Okay, yes,

17:22.458 --> 17:25.336
that's a conveyer belt.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.046
But the point

17:25.378 --> 17:27.046
I'm trying to make here is

17:27.087 --> 17:28.840
that we can give the kids

17:27.087 --> 17:28.840
the best darn Christmas

17:28.882 --> 17:31.175
they have ever had.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.175
