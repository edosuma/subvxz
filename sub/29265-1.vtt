02:33.768 --> 02:34.867
<i>Scenes of horror</i>

02:34.869 --> 02:38.003
<i>in the rebel-held suburbs
of Damascus.</i>

02:38.005 --> 02:40.639
<i>Scores of videos
posted on the Internet</i>

02:40.641 --> 02:42.908
<i>show something terrible
has happened here.</i>

02:44.178 --> 02:46.079
<i>The footage cannot be verified,</i>

02:46.081 --> 02:48.414
<i>but experts have told the BBC</i>

02:48.416 --> 02:50.116
<i>that these appear to be symptoms</i>

02:50.118 --> 02:52.985
<i>of poisoning by chemical agents.</i>

02:52.987 --> 02:55.020
<i>The victims,
many of them children,</i>

02:55.022 --> 02:57.691
<i>appear to be struggling
to breathe.</i>

02:57.693 --> 03:00.827
<i>There's almost no blood,
but many are dead or dying.</i>

03:01.930 --> 03:04.997
<i>If this is found
to have been a chemical attack,</i>

03:04.999 --> 03:08.935
<i>it's likely to have consequences
for the future of Syria's war.</i>

03:08.937 --> 03:11.170
<i>The West will have to look
even harder</i>

03:11.172 --> 03:12.739
<i>at its decision not to get</i>

03:12.741 --> 03:14.841
<i>more involved at a conflict...</i>

03:23.752 --> 03:24.817
Are you okay?

03:24.819 --> 03:26.752
Stupid kid.

03:26.754 --> 03:27.954
May I? I'm a doctor.

03:27.956 --> 03:29.523
It's just
a minor scrape, really.

03:29.525 --> 03:31.824
Don't worry, doctor.

03:31.826 --> 03:33.926
I'm sorry,
I didn't see you brake.

03:33.928 --> 03:35.595
Yes.

03:35.597 --> 03:37.197
Yes, but we should...

03:37.199 --> 03:39.669
exchange insurance details.

03:41.937 --> 03:44.738
Angela Caroni.
Pleasure to meet you.

03:44.740 --> 03:45.908
The pleasure is all mine.

03:46.707 --> 03:48.108
Simon Bell.

03:48.110 --> 03:50.443
Can I help you?

03:50.445 --> 03:52.414
No, it's... it's nothing.
It's nothing, really.

03:52.914 --> 03:55.215
It's just a...

03:55.217 --> 03:58.050
It's just, you...
you raised my blood pressure.

03:58.052 --> 04:00.454
Now I'm sure
you have a concussion.

04:00.456 --> 04:02.058
I'm taking you straight
to the hospital.

04:06.562 --> 04:07.627
You are most welcome

04:07.629 --> 04:09.795
to come visit my store
in Brussels.

04:09.797 --> 04:10.864
It's quite wonderful.

04:10.866 --> 04:11.868
Thank you.

04:29.585 --> 04:30.518
One baklava.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.986
Just the way you like it,
my dear Simon.

04:32.988 --> 04:35.020
For you, <i>sidi,</i>

04:35.022 --> 04:37.958
a lovely kanafeh
with extra pistachios.

04:52.674 --> 04:54.207
Anne-Marie's gonna love it.

04:54.209 --> 04:57.042
Nineteenth-century. Victorian.

04:57.044 --> 04:59.181
Exactly the sort of thing
she's into, right?

05:00.916 --> 05:02.982
It's beautiful.

05:02.984 --> 05:05.619
I'm sure
Anne-Marie will love it.

05:05.621 --> 05:07.520
So, how much you said it was?

05:07.522 --> 05:09.523
- Are you joking?
- Don't start.

05:09.525 --> 05:11.056
It's her birthday present.

05:11.058 --> 05:12.758
I swear, I haven't a clue.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.094
It's been in the store for ages,

05:14.096 --> 05:15.962
I never wanted to part with it.

05:15.964 --> 05:16.966
But for you...

05:18.566 --> 05:19.601
anything.

05:26.073 --> 05:27.609
So what have you got for me?

05:44.693 --> 05:46.292
I don't know much.

05:46.294 --> 05:49.563
But I think the woman
will lead you to it.

05:49.565 --> 05:51.500
You just
have to make her trust you.

05:53.267 --> 05:54.503
General.

06:55.363 --> 06:56.929
<i>We gave up our arsenal</i>

06:56.931 --> 06:58.131
<i>a few years ago.</i>

06:58.133 --> 07:00.667
<i>Even if we have them,
we wouldn't use them.</i>

07:00.669 --> 07:05.171
<i>And we have never used
our chemical, uh, arsenal,</i>

07:05.173 --> 07:06.939
<i>uh, in our history.</i>

07:06.941 --> 07:08.342
<i>So what happened?</i>

07:08.344 --> 07:10.410
<i>As I said,
the only source is Al Qaeda,</i>

07:10.412 --> 07:12.345
<i>we cannot, uh,
take it seriously.</i>

07:12.347 --> 07:13.912
<i>But our impression...</i>

07:17.219 --> 07:18.951
Oh.

07:18.953 --> 07:21.153
To what do I owe
this extraordinary pleasure?

07:21.155 --> 07:23.857
<i>Avram,
we have a code red situation.</i>

07:23.859 --> 07:25.325
<i>It's about General Nader.</i>

07:25.327 --> 07:27.196
<i>The boss is here.
He wants to talk to you.</i>

07:32.299 --> 07:34.202
I don't understand
what happened.

07:35.404 --> 07:36.772
Do we know where
they're keeping him?

07:38.974 --> 07:41.207
Do they smuggle him
back to Damascus?

07:41.209 --> 07:42.311
We don't know yet.

07:44.078 --> 07:46.212
- Poor man.
- Yeah.

07:46.214 --> 07:47.280
How long has it been

07:47.282 --> 07:48.715
since the general pointed you

07:48.717 --> 07:51.217
in the direction
of the woman from Viro?

07:51.219 --> 07:52.988
- What's her name?
- Angela.

07:54.356 --> 07:55.989
- Two weeks.
- Well...

07:55.991 --> 07:57.289
Wouldn't it make more sense

07:57.291 --> 07:58.994
that their old friends
try to take you out?

08:00.061 --> 08:01.361
Why the rush to take him out?

08:01.363 --> 08:02.462
Forty years on the job,

08:02.464 --> 08:04.731
I don't go looking
for sense anymore.

08:04.733 --> 08:06.869
Nor do I.

08:09.070 --> 08:11.006
Why do you think
I came all the way over here?

08:11.907 --> 08:13.008
Because of the general?

08:14.775 --> 08:15.909
No, it's you.

08:15.911 --> 08:17.844
What kind of bullshit
are you trying to spit me, huh?

08:17.846 --> 08:19.949
I always shit
what's bullshit, Avram.

08:20.948 --> 08:21.950
I really do.

08:23.417 --> 08:26.119
But you've been lying to us.

08:26.121 --> 08:28.421
The general said nothing
to offer for a while now.

08:28.423 --> 08:31.794
So you, you just went
and started making things up.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.727
Me and Pe'er
are going to escort you

08:34.730 --> 08:35.965
tomorrow morning to Israel.

08:37.198 --> 08:38.866
There will be an investigation.

08:39.467 --> 08:40.736
A tough one.

08:41.970 --> 08:44.106
I already told you this
a couple years back.

08:45.506 --> 08:46.941
It's time to call it a day.

08:48.009 --> 08:50.375
Spend some years in the sun.

08:50.377 --> 08:53.012
You know as well as I do...

08:53.014 --> 08:55.148
how limited
our window of opportunity is

08:55.150 --> 08:58.017
before these biological weapons
fall into the wrong hands.

08:58.019 --> 08:59.753
There's so many
wrong hands out there,

08:59.755 --> 09:01.354
and you wanna give it all up

09:01.356 --> 09:04.290
just because you no longer trust
your number one man.

09:04.292 --> 09:05.391
Can you live with that?

09:05.393 --> 09:07.196
Can the Prime Minister
live with that?

09:09.865 --> 09:12.431
This woman
is our best lead in years.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.901
I just need some more time
to make her trust me.

09:14.903 --> 09:16.337
Then she'll give me
everything we need.

09:19.775 --> 09:20.875
You have to give me this chance.

09:56.211 --> 09:57.246
<i>Bye.</i>

10:04.452 --> 10:06.518
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain.</i>

10:06.520 --> 10:09.154
<i>We'll shortly arrive at Brussels
International Airport.</i>

10:09.156 --> 10:11.490
<i>Inspect your check-in time
and check-out schedule.</i>

10:11.492 --> 10:12.494
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:22.971 --> 10:25.104
<i>The best book
ever written about</i>

10:25.106 --> 10:28.441
the single most fascinating war
in mankind's history.

10:28.443 --> 10:29.908
I was always fascinated

10:29.910 --> 10:32.512
by the character
of Russia's Minister for War,

10:32.514 --> 10:34.513
Vladimir Sukhomlinov.

10:34.515 --> 10:37.349
It turns out he had the hots
for this young girl

10:37.351 --> 10:40.085
who's married
to a Russian army officer.

10:40.087 --> 10:42.254
Sukhomlinov's best friend
and confidant

10:42.256 --> 10:43.422
was this Austrian guy.

10:43.424 --> 10:44.891
What did they do?

10:44.893 --> 10:47.594
Pinned some bogus charges
on the officer.

10:47.596 --> 10:50.196
Poor officer
had to get a divorce.

10:50.198 --> 10:51.931
In two seconds,

10:51.933 --> 10:55.435
Sukhomlinov married the girl.

10:55.437 --> 10:58.204
Later, it turns out

10:58.206 --> 11:02.609
the Austrian guy was
the Austria-Hungarian Empire's

11:02.611 --> 11:04.914
greatest spy in Russia.

11:06.114 --> 11:07.412
Fascinating story.

11:07.414 --> 11:08.483
Fascinating.

11:18.927 --> 11:20.426
It's my wife's.

11:20.428 --> 11:22.061
I've already read
the book twice.

11:22.063 --> 11:24.229
So, I won't leave
any surprises anyway.

11:24.231 --> 11:26.398
Well, I hope the hero
doesn't die at the end.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.599
It always make me sad.

11:27.601 --> 11:30.269
No, no, no. it's a happy ending.

11:30.271 --> 11:31.470
Don't you worry.

11:31.472 --> 11:32.971
Okay.

11:32.973 --> 11:34.175
So now, I don't have to read it.

11:37.913 --> 11:39.177
Simon Bell.

11:39.179 --> 11:40.215
Ruud van der Veen.

11:41.348 --> 11:43.649
Heading back home? Amsterdam?

11:43.651 --> 11:45.284
Rotterdam.

11:45.286 --> 11:47.152
- It's been a long week.
- Indeed.

11:49.057 --> 11:50.455
How about a drink, then?

11:50.457 --> 11:51.990
Sure.

11:51.992 --> 11:53.459
Let me just make a quick jog
to the gents'

11:53.461 --> 11:54.527
and I'll join you in a minute.

11:54.529 --> 11:55.597
- Yes?
- Yes.

12:02.202 --> 12:03.569
Stay right here.

12:03.571 --> 12:05.007
- Samuel's orders.
- What?

12:05.674 --> 12:07.507
To get in my way?

12:07.509 --> 12:10.109
I get off at Rotterdam.
That's where I'm meeting her.

12:10.111 --> 12:11.145
So, if you'll excuse me...

12:13.448 --> 12:14.947
We have a week
to spend together, so...

12:14.949 --> 12:16.682
A week, eh?

12:16.684 --> 12:18.551
Suppose I need an extra day...

12:18.553 --> 12:20.954
or two, what then?
Off to jail anyway?

12:20.956 --> 12:23.022
I won't let them dump me
in some cell

12:23.024 --> 12:24.123
and throw away the key.

12:24.125 --> 12:25.361
I won't be Prisoner X.

12:26.394 --> 12:27.428
My god.

12:28.563 --> 12:30.032
You're as strong
as your father was.

12:32.967 --> 12:35.133
I'm glad you're here, Daniel.

12:35.135 --> 12:37.402
But I'm really sorry
you got stitched up in this goo.

12:37.404 --> 12:39.241
You deserve better
than being a babysitter.

12:41.308 --> 12:43.710
Pity about you
quitting university.

12:43.712 --> 12:45.614
I hear you're quite
the mathematical genius.

12:47.215 --> 12:48.217
Come now.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.318
Let me pee in peace.

13:28.122 --> 13:29.324
That's one out of the way.

13:31.259 --> 13:33.325
What the fuck are you doing?

13:33.327 --> 13:34.761
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

13:34.763 --> 13:35.695
<i>Rotterdam terminus.</i>

13:35.697 --> 13:36.830
<i>In a few minutes,</i>

13:36.832 --> 13:38.663
<i>we'll be stopping
into Roosendaal station.</i>

13:38.665 --> 13:40.166
<i>Roosendaal station is next.</i>

13:40.168 --> 13:41.167
Fuck.

13:46.174 --> 13:47.175
We gotta get out of here.

14:07.661 --> 14:08.730
Stop!

14:13.400 --> 14:14.402
Stop!

14:15.669 --> 14:17.503
Stop!

14:19.540 --> 14:20.541
Jump!

14:24.712 --> 14:25.713
Stop!

14:47.869 --> 14:49.368
What the fuck were you thinking?

14:51.106 --> 14:52.604
If you're a literary man,

14:52.606 --> 14:55.273
you'd know that Justin Quayle
gets beaten to death

14:55.275 --> 14:56.475
at the end of the novel.

14:56.477 --> 14:57.743
Didn't you at least
see the movie?

14:57.745 --> 14:59.711
It's a good one.

14:59.713 --> 15:02.415
God is in the details, Daniel.
It's the fine print.

15:02.417 --> 15:05.118
It will bite you in the ass
if you don't stop and read it.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.320
That's what I always tell
my recruits.

15:07.322 --> 15:08.854
I'm not
one of your recruits.

15:08.856 --> 15:10.058
Okay. We'll...

15:10.725 --> 15:11.824
We'll go that way,

15:11.826 --> 15:13.292
get some wheels
and take it from there.

15:13.294 --> 15:14.630
Actually, I wanted to do
the opposite.

15:16.197 --> 15:17.696
That's exactly
what they expect us to do.

15:17.698 --> 15:19.500
I'm sure they've
already set up roadblocks.

15:45.927 --> 15:47.792
<i>I've been waiting for hours.</i>

15:47.794 --> 15:48.860
<i>Where are you?</i>

15:52.867 --> 15:54.032
<i>That cannot be.</i>

15:54.034 --> 15:56.605
Look at all these
waste of human life, Daniel.

15:57.739 --> 15:58.740
So much blood.

15:59.573 --> 16:00.575
And for what?

16:02.544 --> 16:03.745
Listen, kid.

16:04.946 --> 16:06.045
There are
a lot of people out there

16:06.047 --> 16:09.282
who'd do anything to stop me
from exposing the truth.

16:09.284 --> 16:11.850
Viro works for whoever
pays them more.

16:11.852 --> 16:14.854
This case, the Syrians
are paying millions

16:14.856 --> 16:16.922
to build up
their biological arsenal.

16:16.924 --> 16:18.057
Bullshit.

16:18.059 --> 16:21.194
Our intel shows no sign
that Viro is involved.

16:21.196 --> 16:22.762
They know nothing.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.230
Trust me, I'm their only source.

16:25.232 --> 16:27.599
And I know
there are Viro people in on it

16:27.601 --> 16:30.202
in their facilities
in Belgium, Holland.

16:30.204 --> 16:32.206
And not only Viro.
This thing runs deep.

16:34.909 --> 16:35.910
Hey, Daniel.

16:37.212 --> 16:38.311
From the day you signed up,

16:38.313 --> 16:39.548
I've been watching you
from afar.

16:40.715 --> 16:41.917
Making sure you're okay.

16:43.818 --> 16:45.450
I owe it to your father.

16:45.452 --> 16:46.454
Your dad and I...

16:48.856 --> 16:50.523
Stop!

16:50.525 --> 16:51.891
- Wait.
- Stop!

16:51.893 --> 16:52.895
Come.

16:53.727 --> 16:54.829
No, no, no.

16:55.763 --> 16:57.430
Oh, he'd be delighted.

16:59.266 --> 17:00.498
You know this little hotel

17:00.500 --> 17:01.968
called Winterhof?

17:01.970 --> 17:03.970
I haven't been around it
for years, but...

17:03.972 --> 17:05.271
I think it's not far.

17:09.343 --> 17:10.509
I thought
you were supposed to meet

17:10.511 --> 17:11.910
that woman in Rotterdam, no?

17:11.912 --> 17:13.846
Yes, yes.
But that can wait.

17:13.848 --> 17:14.849
Don't worry.

17:29.429 --> 17:30.532
We're fully booked.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.866
Who's playing? Hm?

17:33.868 --> 17:35.604
Amateurs.

17:38.872 --> 17:40.208
Are you for the Castle Lords?

17:41.042 --> 17:42.311
Or the People's Club?

17:43.945 --> 17:45.878
My guess would be
the Castle Lords.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.881
Am I right?

17:49.417 --> 17:51.220
I'm for the People's Club.

17:52.019 --> 17:53.351
Or was it the people?

18:04.631 --> 18:06.398
Otorongo.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.667
<i>Johan and the Alverman.</i>

18:07.669 --> 18:08.967
It's a great show.

18:08.969 --> 18:11.003
This Otorongo
was quite a character.

18:11.005 --> 18:12.071
He was my uncle.

18:12.073 --> 18:13.438
Your uncle?

18:13.440 --> 18:14.506
That's amazing.

18:14.508 --> 18:16.809
Yeah, the poor man died
years ago.

18:16.811 --> 18:18.711
I remember when... Yes!

18:24.584 --> 18:27.355
Oh.

18:28.755 --> 18:30.691
I think that deserves
a drink, don't you?

18:34.027 --> 18:35.563
So, do you have a room for us?

19:15.803 --> 19:17.072
You smell
like a prostitute.

19:17.905 --> 19:18.907
Thank you.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.576
So, what did Samuel
tell you then?

19:23.578 --> 19:25.013
Nothing that
I wanna share with you.

19:26.380 --> 19:27.381
Thank you.

19:29.383 --> 19:31.018
- Is that it?
- Mm-hm.

19:32.853 --> 19:34.422
You can't go to dinner
like that.

19:40.026 --> 19:41.028
Careful.

19:43.063 --> 19:44.632
It's not as innocent
as it looks.

19:53.673 --> 19:54.875
Leave your passport
with me.

20:39.754 --> 20:41.622
I took the liberty
of ordering for us.

20:43.957 --> 20:44.959
And it smells great.

20:52.099 --> 20:53.732
Okay.

20:53.734 --> 20:56.569
You're probably thinking
this is just a simple pea soup.

20:56.571 --> 20:58.169
But no. It's not simple at all.

20:58.171 --> 20:59.804
The secret lies
in the ingredients

20:59.806 --> 21:01.139
and the slow cooking.

21:01.141 --> 21:03.042
And there's a test.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.909
You're supposed to be able
to stand your spoon upright

21:04.911 --> 21:06.544
in a good pea soup, but...

21:06.546 --> 21:09.247
peas are not
to be taken lightly.

21:09.249 --> 21:10.949
You could spend a lifetime

21:10.951 --> 21:12.019
looking for the perfect one.

21:20.026 --> 21:21.563
If Judah can see us now,

21:23.197 --> 21:24.733
both of us sitting here,

21:26.266 --> 21:27.565
he'd die.

21:27.567 --> 21:28.569
He did.

21:29.704 --> 21:30.705
You forgot.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.843
Your dad and I were the same.

21:36.944 --> 21:38.447
Same passion for life.

21:39.213 --> 21:41.080
Same drive. Same taste.

21:41.082 --> 21:43.182
We first met...

21:43.184 --> 21:46.851
Nader Khadir Abdulkhara
in Bonn, Germany.

21:46.853 --> 21:49.187
Yeah, I know where Bonn is.
I was born there.

21:49.189 --> 21:50.458
Yeah, I know.

21:52.627 --> 21:54.560
Anyway...

21:54.562 --> 21:55.895
He was a colonel then.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.163
And we had reason to believe

21:57.165 --> 22:00.666
that he had information about
our dear friend and master spy,

22:00.668 --> 22:01.736
Isaac Leevy...

22:03.070 --> 22:05.303
who vanished in Damascus.

22:05.305 --> 22:08.573
We asked permission
to recruit him, Nader,

22:08.575 --> 22:10.708
and HQ said, "No. We're on it.

22:10.710 --> 22:11.944
Stay out of it."

22:11.946 --> 22:13.913
So your dad said, "Fuck them.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.684
We're not gonna leave
poor Isaac out there.

22:16.150 --> 22:17.582
Fuck them."

22:17.584 --> 22:20.151
He was something special,
your dad.

22:20.153 --> 22:23.121
Nader had just finished
his term in Germany.

22:23.123 --> 22:26.292
He was getting ready to leave
for his next post in Brussels.

22:26.294 --> 22:27.659
We knew he loved antiques.

22:27.661 --> 22:29.727
My cover
was a Brussels antiques dealer.

22:29.729 --> 22:30.829
I introduced your father,

22:30.831 --> 22:33.331
presented him as my dear friend
and client, Freddy.

22:33.333 --> 22:34.500
Freddy Blaine.

22:34.502 --> 22:38.236
I figured we'd soon become
fast friends, which we did.

22:38.238 --> 22:40.238
We had him in our hands.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.675
His code name was Ahab.

22:44.844 --> 22:45.846
Daniel.

22:48.114 --> 22:49.650
There are many things
I could tell you.

22:51.351 --> 22:52.984
Good evening, gentlemen.

22:52.986 --> 22:55.321
I'm Anne-Marie, the owner.

22:55.323 --> 22:57.322
Have you been enjoying
your time here?

22:57.324 --> 22:59.724
Simon Bell.

22:59.726 --> 23:04.629
This dinner is a true testament
to Madam's exquisite taste,

23:04.631 --> 23:07.632
and, if I may say so, beauty.

23:08.936 --> 23:12.605
- It's just a pea soup.
- Ah, but an exquisite one.

23:12.607 --> 23:14.543
Peas are not
to be taken lightly.

23:17.044 --> 23:19.278
I could swear I've seen you
somewhere before.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.846
I get that from a lot of people.

23:20.848 --> 23:23.749
I must have one of those faces.

23:23.751 --> 23:25.684
Now, if you'll excuse me...

23:25.686 --> 23:29.088
We should at least have a drink
in honor of your birthday.

23:29.090 --> 23:32.226
One would have to be blind
to miss your adoring fans.

23:37.031 --> 23:38.133
Spiegelau.

23:38.865 --> 23:40.232
Nice.

23:40.234 --> 23:42.368
I keep them
for special occasions.

23:42.370 --> 23:45.070
But I'm not sure this one is.

23:45.072 --> 23:47.639
Come on.
All birthdays are special.

23:47.641 --> 23:49.375
Mm.

23:55.749 --> 23:56.750
My god.

23:58.718 --> 24:00.154
- It's you.
- Mm-hm.

24:00.920 --> 24:01.922
Wow!

24:04.792 --> 24:06.859
I was totally in love with you.

24:06.861 --> 24:09.128
A lot of men
fell in love with me back then.

24:09.130 --> 24:10.195
- Women too.
- Ah.

24:10.197 --> 24:12.063
But that's all in the past.

24:12.065 --> 24:14.265
Only memories are left.

24:14.267 --> 24:16.167
And they're not all that sweet.

24:16.169 --> 24:18.137
You're too young
to talk like that.

24:18.139 --> 24:20.406
You're really kind.

24:20.408 --> 24:22.006
I've been meaning to ask you.

24:22.008 --> 24:24.309
What exactly brought you here
in the first place?

24:24.311 --> 24:26.110
My dear.

24:26.112 --> 24:27.748
My bladder's about to burst.

24:29.283 --> 24:30.284
I'll be right back.

25:43.323 --> 25:46.023
You cannot stay here,
Anne-Marie.

25:46.025 --> 25:47.128
What?

25:51.832 --> 25:53.298
So this whole charade

25:53.300 --> 25:55.067
is just so you could come here

25:55.069 --> 25:58.369
and tell me there's no point
waiting for Nader?

25:58.371 --> 25:59.807
Is that what it was?

26:02.109 --> 26:04.443
I gave up
so much to be with him.

26:04.445 --> 26:06.811
And I regret nothing.

26:06.813 --> 26:09.247
All these years, I kept hearing,

26:09.249 --> 26:11.483
"One day, something
is going to happen.

26:11.485 --> 26:13.084
And I won't be back.

26:13.086 --> 26:14.418
But you will wait for me.

26:14.420 --> 26:16.120
You mustn't go anywhere.

26:16.122 --> 26:18.890
Because in the end,
no matter what,

26:18.892 --> 26:20.391
I will be back."

26:20.393 --> 26:22.461
I was Nader's big secret.

26:22.463 --> 26:23.898
No one knew about me.

26:25.431 --> 26:26.497
If you feel
anything's wrong,

26:26.499 --> 26:27.768
anything at all,

26:28.468 --> 26:29.737
call me, okay?

26:30.804 --> 26:32.137
I'll be okay.

26:32.139 --> 26:34.205
I just want Nader to be okay.

26:34.207 --> 26:35.541
Yeah.

26:35.543 --> 26:36.745
Me too.

26:39.412 --> 26:41.381
Don't forget
to bring my poor car back.

26:45.149 --> 26:47.051
I left you something
in Nader's black briefcase.

26:47.053 --> 26:48.352
But I don't have the code.

26:48.354 --> 26:49.457
I left it open.

26:50.224 --> 26:51.292
Let's go.

26:56.563 --> 26:58.263
You can keep on saying

26:58.265 --> 27:00.331
how weird it is
'til the Mossad comes,

27:00.333 --> 27:02.568
but it wasn't until
I got off that train

27:02.570 --> 27:04.903
that I realized
how close we actually were

27:04.905 --> 27:06.471
to Anne-Marie's place.

27:06.473 --> 27:08.607
I don't believe in coincidences.

27:08.609 --> 27:10.943
Not the guy on the train,
not Anne-Marie.

27:10.945 --> 27:12.578
Do you believe in God?

27:12.580 --> 27:15.313
- What?
- Einstein once said that,

27:15.315 --> 27:18.082
"Coincidences are God's way
of keeping his anonymity."

27:18.084 --> 27:19.517
You see?
Even he was a man of faith.

27:20.588 --> 27:22.290
I bet you never
suspected him, hey?

27:26.593 --> 27:27.993
Are we close to the border?

27:27.995 --> 27:29.030
That's...

27:30.430 --> 27:31.466
What the fuck?

27:33.499 --> 27:34.565
Take it easy.

27:35.636 --> 27:37.005
Easy, easy, easy.

28:15.309 --> 28:17.242
- Martens.
- <i>Samuel.</i>

28:17.244 --> 28:20.111
<i>My agents are bringing you
the old-timer and the kid.</i>

28:20.113 --> 28:22.981
<i>But I really can't cover up
for you much more.</i>

28:22.983 --> 28:24.049
I know, I know.

28:24.051 --> 28:25.516
- <i>Don't worry.</i>
- Mm-hm.

28:25.518 --> 28:26.784
<i>Listen, Martens.</i>

28:26.786 --> 28:30.187
We would never act on Belgium
solely without your permission.

28:30.189 --> 28:32.390
<i>I never
doubted that, my friend.</i>

28:32.392 --> 28:35.526
I simply wanna make sure
there are no misunderstandings.

28:35.528 --> 28:36.594
<i>None whatsoever.</i>

29:03.990 --> 29:05.090
How amusing.

29:05.092 --> 29:06.724
Do you have a problem?

29:06.726 --> 29:09.628
Take it up with our good friend,
the State Security.

29:09.630 --> 29:11.596
Martens gave me a call and asked
whether we happen to be

29:11.598 --> 29:14.065
in the middle of
some assignment or operation

29:14.067 --> 29:15.567
he wasn't informed of.

29:15.569 --> 29:16.635
They were onto you

29:16.637 --> 29:18.270
the minute you boarded
the train.

29:18.272 --> 29:19.705
Luckily, you didn't kill
the poor guy

29:19.707 --> 29:20.941
who was tailing you.

29:22.109 --> 29:24.478
You, with me. You. Don't move.

30:20.300 --> 30:21.302
Daniel.

30:56.803 --> 30:58.203
There's a lot more stories

30:58.205 --> 31:00.140
- I can tell you about him.
- Okay, okay.

31:05.446 --> 31:06.610
Thank you very much.

31:06.612 --> 31:07.681
Thank you.

31:12.186 --> 31:13.851
They just love you, don't they?

31:13.853 --> 31:16.788
Oh, most of these kids
I used to train, so...

31:17.858 --> 31:19.757
I know.

31:19.759 --> 31:22.359
I was one of those kids,
remember?

31:22.361 --> 31:24.329
I really admired you.

31:24.331 --> 31:25.263
And now you betrayed us.

31:25.265 --> 31:26.798
- Samuel, I don't...
- The conclusive result

31:26.800 --> 31:27.666
of the check we ran

31:27.668 --> 31:29.701
on how the general
was handled by you

31:29.703 --> 31:32.670
over the years
should be coming in really soon.

31:32.672 --> 31:34.872
I truly wanna believe
that you forging the reports

31:34.874 --> 31:36.343
is only a recent thing.

31:38.644 --> 31:40.113
Okay. Now...

31:41.281 --> 31:42.347
These are the latest images

31:42.349 --> 31:44.349
from the chemical plant
in Al Safir.

31:44.351 --> 31:47.151
We really tried,
but we couldn't find anything.

31:47.153 --> 31:50.554
So, it's pretty damn simple.

31:50.556 --> 31:52.624
You bring us the smoking gun
you've been promising,

31:52.626 --> 31:54.225
and you live.

31:54.227 --> 31:55.228
You don't deliver...

33:31.358 --> 33:33.425
<i>Where were you yesterday?</i>

33:33.427 --> 33:35.560
<i>I waited for nothing.</i>

33:35.562 --> 33:37.365
<i>See you at seven o'clock
at the restaurant.</i>

33:41.868 --> 33:44.301
<i>There's something
I've been curious about.</i>

33:44.303 --> 33:45.473
But you have to be honest.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.708
I'm always honest.

33:48.742 --> 33:50.242
Why me?

33:50.244 --> 33:52.246
This country's full
of beautiful women.

33:55.782 --> 33:56.848
Ooh.

33:56.850 --> 33:59.016
<i>Why you? Well...</i>

33:59.018 --> 34:00.452
<i>It's just that
in my line of work,</i>

34:00.454 --> 34:04.755
<i>we have to be super sensitive
about industrial espionage.</i>

34:04.757 --> 34:06.893
<i>I was convinced
you were following me.</i>

34:07.794 --> 34:09.693
Well, I was following you.

34:09.695 --> 34:10.898
But for other reasons.

34:11.764 --> 34:13.530
Other reasons?

34:13.532 --> 34:15.600
You make me feel...

34:15.601 --> 34:17.271
May I offer you desserts?

34:20.373 --> 34:22.907
I'm sorry,
but my boss is insisting

34:22.909 --> 34:24.809
adjourning this meeting.

34:24.811 --> 34:27.610
- <i>Is that right?</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

34:27.612 --> 34:28.978
<i>I want to kill your boss.</i>

34:28.981 --> 34:30.418
I'll do it myself.

34:35.688 --> 34:36.887
Good evening, madam.

34:36.889 --> 34:38.257
Good evening, Philip.

34:47.699 --> 34:48.867
What?

34:48.869 --> 34:51.369
I didn't tail her because
I wasn't about to leave you

34:51.371 --> 34:52.469
without your back covered.

34:52.472 --> 34:53.474
Rookie's mistake.

35:01.414 --> 35:03.048
License plate
of the car she got into.

35:03.050 --> 35:04.783
You should have followed them.

35:04.785 --> 35:07.619
Leaving you unattended once
was more than enough, thank you.

35:07.621 --> 35:09.387
You gotta think
outside the box, kid.

35:09.389 --> 35:10.754
How old are you, anyway?

35:10.756 --> 35:11.758
Old enough.

35:16.662 --> 35:17.729
And to you.

35:17.731 --> 35:20.899
My license plate number,
1-BGK-912.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.001
And, sorry? My name?

35:23.003 --> 35:24.037
Yes.

35:25.505 --> 35:26.838
Johan Slegers.

35:26.840 --> 35:29.774
What is the latest address
you have for me on file?

35:29.776 --> 35:30.874
We got it.

35:30.876 --> 35:32.410
Um...

35:32.412 --> 35:34.448
41 Van Breestrat.

35:34.981 --> 35:36.347
Yes.

35:36.349 --> 35:38.483
That's where I live.

35:38.485 --> 35:39.818
You're very kind, thank you.

35:43.923 --> 35:45.626
- Can we go now?
- Yes, yes.

35:47.026 --> 35:49.296
Sorry, old-school.
Can't help it.

36:10.717 --> 36:12.751
So what do we want
from the Sleger's?

36:12.753 --> 36:14.084
We don't want anything.

36:14.086 --> 36:16.687
We need to find out
what he's about.

36:16.689 --> 36:18.390
How? Wait.

36:29.102 --> 36:31.372
Excuse me.

36:33.173 --> 36:34.375
Uh...

36:35.041 --> 36:36.474
We're in...

36:36.476 --> 36:38.675
a bit of a jam
with our car here.

36:38.677 --> 36:40.879
I was wondering, would you be
so kind as to help us out

36:40.881 --> 36:42.814
with a bottle of water maybe?

36:42.816 --> 36:44.481
Ain't got none.

36:44.483 --> 36:46.586
No use,
the battery's totally dead.

36:47.621 --> 36:48.689
I mean, for real.

36:49.555 --> 36:50.789
Um...

36:50.791 --> 36:51.823
A phone call, perhaps?

36:51.825 --> 36:53.825
Sorry, no can do.

37:03.537 --> 37:04.538
Comrade.

37:05.671 --> 37:07.604
Sergeant John Paul Mondong.

37:07.606 --> 37:09.573
Eleventh Paratroop Division.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.910
Battle of Kolwezi '78.

37:11.912 --> 37:13.881
Well, as I live and breathe...

37:16.148 --> 37:19.082
Private First Class
Alexander Jacobs.

37:19.084 --> 37:20.852
Second Parachute Regiment.

37:20.854 --> 37:22.390
Iraq, 1991.

37:23.189 --> 37:24.455
"Every legionnaire..."

37:24.457 --> 37:25.657
"...is your brother in arms,

37:25.659 --> 37:28.992
whatever his nationality,
his race, or religion might be.

37:28.994 --> 37:31.495
You show him the same
close solidarity

37:31.497 --> 37:33.698
that unites the members
of the same family."

37:35.968 --> 37:39.736
First five bottles in the car,
we'll be saving for Michelle.

37:39.738 --> 37:41.606
My friend Alexander here
is thirsty.

37:41.608 --> 37:42.843
Well, I am thirsty.

37:59.693 --> 38:00.761
Thank you, Alexander.

38:01.561 --> 38:02.593
We gotta move on.

38:02.595 --> 38:04.631
Our guys will take the car
back to Anne-Marie.

38:07.601 --> 38:08.702
See you later, old chap.

38:12.506 --> 38:14.542
Daniel, how do we
get back to town?

38:19.111 --> 38:20.577
I don't know,
but based on these,

38:20.579 --> 38:23.146
he's nothing special,
this Johan Slegers.

38:23.148 --> 38:26.584
An attorney specializing
in environmental suits.

38:26.586 --> 38:28.785
It states here
that Dr. Angela Caroni,

38:28.787 --> 38:29.887
is an expert witness

38:29.889 --> 38:33.024
in a lawsuit against
a polluting factory in Shaqlawa.

38:33.026 --> 38:35.026
Nothing to write home about.

38:35.028 --> 38:37.595
"Nothing to write home about."
Are you kidding me?

38:37.597 --> 38:39.066
It means she's totally kosher.

38:39.999 --> 38:41.265
How?

38:41.267 --> 38:43.066
Oh, come on, Daniel.

38:43.068 --> 38:44.135
Do you think the General

38:44.137 --> 38:45.937
pointed her out to me
for nothing?

38:45.939 --> 38:48.539
She's a senior consultant
of Viro's CEO

38:48.541 --> 38:50.807
on all matters
related to toxic waste,

38:50.809 --> 38:54.211
hazardous material,
and all environmental issues.

38:54.213 --> 38:57.247
Environmental protection
is her soft spot.

38:57.249 --> 38:59.586
Okay. How do we benefit from it?

39:00.619 --> 39:01.822
Okay.

39:03.189 --> 39:05.722
Viro listens to her...

39:05.724 --> 39:07.559
because they know
that without her thumbs up

39:07.561 --> 39:08.693
that they're clean,

39:08.695 --> 39:10.630
they'll never get the
government's stamp of approval.

39:11.331 --> 39:12.533
They need her.

39:13.066 --> 39:14.832
We need them.

39:14.834 --> 39:16.837
All I have to do
is to get her to need me.

39:18.637 --> 39:19.706
Easy.

39:20.606 --> 39:21.705
I never said it was easy.

39:21.707 --> 39:23.274
Yeah, but you think it is.

39:29.115 --> 39:30.117
My dear.

39:31.684 --> 39:32.919
I was just thinking about you.

39:34.186 --> 39:36.155
Oh, come on.
No need to be sorry.

39:37.791 --> 39:40.191
Well, as long as
he didn't keep you up too late.

39:43.028 --> 39:44.097
I'd be delighted.

39:45.631 --> 39:46.767
Tomorrow? Four o'clock?

39:47.700 --> 39:49.633
Sounds wonderful.

39:49.635 --> 39:51.639
No, no, no.
Let me choose the place.

39:53.206 --> 39:54.842
Bye.

39:56.242 --> 39:58.175
So, do you have a plan?

39:58.177 --> 39:59.313
I'm working on it.

40:00.280 --> 40:01.282
Do you want to eat?

40:10.356 --> 40:11.559
Try it.

40:14.160 --> 40:16.063
Aah. Good for the soul.

40:19.298 --> 40:21.231
I love this.

40:21.233 --> 40:23.901
The eels
are from the River Scheldt.

40:23.903 --> 40:25.970
And they're prepared
with whatever fresh herbs

40:25.972 --> 40:28.138
they can find along
the riverbank.

40:28.140 --> 40:29.707
They're all added
at the last minute

40:29.709 --> 40:31.242
to preserve the green color.

40:31.244 --> 40:33.711
A bit too green for me.

40:33.713 --> 40:35.646
Well, your dad
wasn't a big fan either,

40:35.648 --> 40:37.180
but he was a good sport.

40:37.182 --> 40:38.251
He faked it.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.320
The seat you're sitting in now

40:43.322 --> 40:45.091
is the exact same one he used.

40:49.963 --> 40:51.231
Is that why you brought me here?

40:54.434 --> 40:55.669
Come on, come on.

40:57.302 --> 40:58.304
Sit down.

40:59.673 --> 41:00.674
Eat.

41:12.418 --> 41:14.251
It became a tradition,

41:14.253 --> 41:15.986
us meeting here.

41:15.988 --> 41:18.256
That last time,
we were both pretty much

41:18.258 --> 41:19.791
already on our way out.

41:19.793 --> 41:22.827
We delivered the intel
on Isaac Leevy.

41:22.829 --> 41:24.796
The Syrians hanged him anyway.

41:24.798 --> 41:26.097
Poor guy.

41:26.099 --> 41:27.832
So, we decided

41:27.834 --> 41:30.468
to come for one last round
of <i>pale et gruit,</i>

41:30.470 --> 41:31.805
a drop of Jenever.

41:33.106 --> 41:35.472
Your dad had this way
of saying things.

41:35.474 --> 41:37.709
His head would be halfway down,

41:37.711 --> 41:39.380
only the eyes looking up at me.

41:40.880 --> 41:44.115
"Any regrets, Avram?" He asked.

41:44.117 --> 41:46.084
"Hell no," I told him.

41:46.086 --> 41:47.154
"And you?"

41:59.499 --> 42:01.765
Something wrong?
You didn't like it?

42:01.767 --> 42:03.901
- Uh...
- His dad didn't like it either.

42:03.903 --> 42:05.436
Like father like son.

42:05.438 --> 42:07.104
You're the brick.

42:07.106 --> 42:09.140
Is George here?

42:09.142 --> 42:11.142
I'd really love
to say hello, it's uh...

42:11.144 --> 42:13.945
Tell him Simon's here
with Freddy's son

42:13.947 --> 42:16.347
who is just as handsome
as his father was.

42:16.349 --> 42:19.517
'Cause it's been a long,
long time since I've seen him.

42:19.519 --> 42:21.789
Sorry, he passed away
five years ago.

42:23.423 --> 42:24.425
I'm his son.

42:25.457 --> 42:26.827
Were you good friends?

42:27.827 --> 42:28.861
Oh, yes.

42:30.829 --> 42:32.265
I'm really sorry to hear that.

42:35.401 --> 42:36.803
I'm really sorry to hear that.

42:39.338 --> 42:40.937
What can I say?

43:01.160 --> 43:02.359
<i>Continuous allegations</i>

43:02.361 --> 43:05.495
<i>of chemical weapons in
various fighting zones in Syria.</i>

43:05.497 --> 43:08.099
<i>Since 2014, allegations...</i>

43:08.101 --> 43:09.966
So, based on your plan,
I found this place

43:09.968 --> 43:11.905
for a good price
and no questions asked.

43:12.838 --> 43:14.338
Great.

43:14.340 --> 43:17.475
Yeah, okay. I'm willing to pay
six months in advance.

43:17.477 --> 43:18.943
When do you want to start?

43:18.945 --> 43:20.080
Right away.

43:51.443 --> 43:52.943
Something's on your mind?

43:52.945 --> 43:53.947
Nothing.

43:55.048 --> 43:56.049
I'm just happy.

43:58.084 --> 43:59.086
Me too.

44:23.242 --> 44:24.475
Okay, guys.

44:24.477 --> 44:25.479
Take your positions.

44:29.349 --> 44:30.615
Oh.

44:32.151 --> 44:33.486
What on earth happened here?

44:47.499 --> 44:49.934
This is organophosphate.

44:49.936 --> 44:52.171
It's an agricultural pesticide.

44:57.175 --> 44:59.943
Whoever committed
this ecological atrocity

44:59.945 --> 45:01.611
literally dumped

45:01.613 --> 45:04.381
a container's worth
of this stuff into the river.

45:04.383 --> 45:06.986
People everywhere
will do anything for money.

45:08.086 --> 45:09.620
Not everyone.

45:09.622 --> 45:11.454
There are still good people
out there.

45:11.456 --> 45:13.557
Minority.

45:13.559 --> 45:16.095
So let's agree
we are part of that minority.

45:17.329 --> 45:18.598
Well, I have to think
about that.

45:20.465 --> 45:21.666
I'm not so sure you are.

45:22.936 --> 45:23.937
Bastard.

45:25.137 --> 45:27.104
Of course, I am.

45:27.106 --> 45:28.642
It's what I do for a living.

45:29.441 --> 45:30.476
What's that?

45:34.414 --> 45:36.917
I try to protect people.

45:50.195 --> 45:51.197
You're blushing.

45:51.697 --> 45:53.296
That's cute.

45:56.336 --> 45:58.369
I've got
the most vicious craving

45:58.371 --> 46:00.537
for this Portuguese cake.

46:00.539 --> 46:02.342
Pastel de nata, it's called.

46:03.075 --> 46:05.008
It's heaven.

46:05.010 --> 46:06.279
When did you last have it?

46:07.146 --> 46:08.713
It was in Lisbon.

46:08.715 --> 46:10.918
And it feels like
a hundred years ago.

46:12.318 --> 46:13.653
What did you lose in Lisbon?

46:15.220 --> 46:16.289
Lose?

46:17.622 --> 46:19.325
Love, I guess.

46:20.526 --> 46:22.193
Love.

46:22.195 --> 46:23.397
He was an idiot.

46:24.197 --> 46:25.265
And?

46:26.698 --> 46:28.599
There is no and.

46:28.601 --> 46:30.102
Just a broken heart.

47:11.144 --> 47:12.309
May I come in?

47:12.311 --> 47:13.544
No.

47:13.546 --> 47:14.648
Who are you?

47:15.414 --> 47:17.080
Who sent you?

47:17.082 --> 47:19.249
I'm not at liberty
to tell you, but...

47:19.251 --> 47:20.619
I do have a wonderful present
for you.

47:23.456 --> 47:24.722
Fresh from the oven.

47:43.342 --> 47:45.075
Remember your brother-in-arms?

47:45.077 --> 47:46.544
Alexander Jacobs?

47:46.546 --> 47:49.479
- Guard from the Slegers' house?
- Yes.

47:49.481 --> 47:51.717
Turns out he spent years
working under Martens.

48:00.226 --> 48:01.327
Very interesting.

48:02.260 --> 48:03.262
Where'd you get this?

48:04.463 --> 48:06.465
Made some inquiries, you know.

48:10.102 --> 48:11.001
Does Samuel know?

48:11.003 --> 48:13.169
That's what
you're worried about? No.

48:13.171 --> 48:14.037
Samuel doesn't know.

48:14.039 --> 48:15.039
I'll tell you what
I'm worried about.

48:15.041 --> 48:17.410
I'm worried about
whatever Martens is up to.

48:22.849 --> 48:25.318
Good job then, you signed up
with us after all.

48:27.586 --> 48:29.822
How did your mom feel
about you joining the Mossad?

48:31.423 --> 48:33.256
Mother?

48:33.258 --> 48:35.626
I had no contact
with her in years.

48:35.628 --> 48:37.595
It was my grandmother
who raised me back in Israel.

48:37.597 --> 48:39.896
Yeah, right.

48:39.898 --> 48:41.834
I should have known that, sorry.

49:52.972 --> 49:54.207
Sorry?

49:54.606 --> 49:55.673
English.

49:55.675 --> 49:59.676
Oh, ah. Your dad
seems in top shape.

49:59.678 --> 50:02.715
Yeah, but the mind's not really
there anymore, you know.

50:03.749 --> 50:05.448
Oh.

50:05.450 --> 50:06.686
It's not easy for them.

50:09.255 --> 50:10.256
It's sad.

50:19.465 --> 50:21.700
Did you notice how
she was checking you out?

50:24.970 --> 50:26.173
Hm?

50:27.572 --> 50:29.640
Oh, come on, Daniel.

50:29.642 --> 50:31.912
You don't turn your back
on a sure thing like that.

50:33.579 --> 50:34.714
When I was your age...

50:39.318 --> 50:40.783
I have some bad news.

50:40.785 --> 50:42.318
Shoot.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.486
It's Anne-Marie.

50:43.488 --> 50:44.657
The Syrians got to her.

51:18.890 --> 51:20.356
Ah.

51:25.030 --> 51:26.332
Wipe your hands.

51:42.548 --> 51:43.883
A week before he passed away,

51:45.751 --> 51:47.684
he couldn't talk anymore,
he asked me with his hands,

51:47.686 --> 51:51.655
to fetch him that Book of Psalms
from the table.

51:51.657 --> 51:53.325
Somebody's left it there
at noon that day.

51:54.727 --> 51:55.795
Right, I figured.

51:56.762 --> 51:58.629
Judas finally lost it.

51:58.631 --> 52:00.267
And he starts
leafing through it.

52:01.566 --> 52:02.936
Knew exactly
what he was looking for.

52:06.972 --> 52:08.041
"Man is like a breath.

52:10.508 --> 52:12.544
His days
are but a fleeting shadow."

52:30.496 --> 52:31.497
Coming.

52:53.519 --> 52:54.885
I just wanted
to see you.

53:01.660 --> 53:02.662
Come.

53:20.479 --> 53:22.582
You make love
just like you live life.

53:24.517 --> 53:25.518
Meaning?

53:26.418 --> 53:27.519
In despair.

53:30.122 --> 53:31.424
Why do you say that?

53:33.592 --> 53:35.492
Because I feel it.

53:35.494 --> 53:36.528
And I know what it's like.

53:38.063 --> 53:39.064
<i>You...</i>

53:40.800 --> 53:43.700
<i>You know what it's like?</i>

53:43.702 --> 53:46.669
<i>I know what it's like
to want your independence.</i>

53:46.671 --> 53:48.108
<i>And the price you pay for it.</i>

53:50.209 --> 53:51.707
<i>And what's that?</i>

53:51.709 --> 53:52.711
<i>Loneliness.</i>

54:53.539 --> 54:54.607
Good morning.

54:55.508 --> 54:56.509
Sleep well?

56:03.575 --> 56:07.209
This is one of my last
remaining indoor space.

56:07.211 --> 56:09.012
You really should have a go.

56:09.014 --> 56:10.012
Cleanses the soul.

56:10.014 --> 56:12.849
I could really use
some soul-cleansing today.

56:12.851 --> 56:13.916
Yeah.

56:13.918 --> 56:16.153
It was a bad day. Let's talk.

56:16.155 --> 56:18.254
We tried real hard
not to put you on the spot,

56:18.256 --> 56:19.992
but the Syrians
are playing it rough.

56:21.593 --> 56:22.662
We have to respond.

56:23.963 --> 56:26.129
I've always had
your back, Samuel.

56:26.131 --> 56:28.698
I'll look the other way
when it was necessary,

56:28.700 --> 56:31.901
but I am about to go
into early retirement,

56:31.903 --> 56:34.541
and I would like to go quietly.

56:37.776 --> 56:39.279
Better hurry, Samuel.

56:40.713 --> 56:42.180
I'll be out of cards soon.

57:56.789 --> 57:57.854
Hey!

01:00:22.334 --> 01:00:23.336
Looks good, huh?

01:00:23.901 --> 01:00:24.903
What?

01:00:26.905 --> 01:00:29.539
All of it.
The offices, the logo.

01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:31.073
The boys have been
working really hard

01:00:31.075 --> 01:00:32.475
to make Leptrochemicals

01:00:32.477 --> 01:00:34.276
look like a real
working company.

01:00:34.278 --> 01:00:35.280
Yeah.

01:00:36.447 --> 01:00:37.449
Great.

01:00:41.186 --> 01:00:42.188
You okay?

01:00:43.921 --> 01:00:45.287
Oh, much better than okay.

01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:47.425
Pretty damn excellent,
as a matter of fact.

01:01:05.276 --> 01:01:07.109
Yes?

01:01:07.111 --> 01:01:08.445
Hold on a second.

01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:10.280
Well?

01:01:10.282 --> 01:01:11.948
The prey has been trapped.

01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:13.483
Matter of days now.

01:01:13.485 --> 01:01:14.486
You look...

01:01:15.586 --> 01:01:16.653
pale.

01:01:16.655 --> 01:01:18.954
Me? No. Strong as a bone.

01:01:18.956 --> 01:01:19.958
Why?

01:01:23.662 --> 01:01:25.495
Oh, you did well last night.

01:01:25.497 --> 01:01:26.298
Thank you.

01:01:28.133 --> 01:01:29.365
Sorry, Martens.
I'm with you.

01:01:29.367 --> 01:01:30.369
<i>No worries.</i>

01:01:33.005 --> 01:01:34.470
Things are moving fast
with Angela.

01:01:34.472 --> 01:01:36.171
That's why emotions
come in to play.

01:01:36.173 --> 01:01:38.541
You had to move quickly
to get her emotionally attached.

01:01:38.543 --> 01:01:41.343
Intentionally, do just about
anything to keep you.

01:01:41.345 --> 01:01:42.948
A couple more days,
I'm going to have to kill.

01:01:52.157 --> 01:01:53.292
She's not in love with you.

01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:59.164
Why'd you say that?

01:02:02.133 --> 01:02:03.135
She just...

01:02:04.403 --> 01:02:05.936
pities you.

01:02:05.938 --> 01:02:07.303
Nonsense.

01:02:07.305 --> 01:02:09.071
I can feel her.

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:10.309
My senses never fail me.

01:02:11.008 --> 01:02:12.010
Never.

01:02:17.048 --> 01:02:18.050
Let's go.

01:02:30.628 --> 01:02:32.528
- Wanna sit down for a second?
- Maybe.

01:02:44.675 --> 01:02:46.044
You can't
go on like this.

01:02:47.378 --> 01:02:49.012
I'm going to Samuel.

01:02:49.014 --> 01:02:49.946
This is nothing.

01:02:49.948 --> 01:02:52.017
And you're not saying anything
to anyone.

01:02:53.485 --> 01:02:56.686
No way I'm gonna give them
that satisfaction.

01:02:56.688 --> 01:02:57.990
No goddamn way.

01:03:15.539 --> 01:03:16.541
Daniel?

01:03:17.476 --> 01:03:18.477
Sit down.

01:03:21.747 --> 01:03:24.446
<i>"We took the plunge
because we chose to.</i>

01:03:24.448 --> 01:03:27.182
<i>No one twisted our arm
into doing anything.</i>

01:03:27.184 --> 01:03:29.385
<i>We wanted to save a friend."</i>

01:03:29.387 --> 01:03:30.722
This is what your father
said to me.

01:03:32.323 --> 01:03:33.390
So, I said to him,

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:34.393
"Listen.

01:03:36.427 --> 01:03:39.495
I'm the one who made
all the decisions here.

01:03:39.497 --> 01:03:41.700
So, I'll just tell them
that I'm the one who pushed you.

01:03:43.035 --> 01:03:44.533
Lied to you.

01:03:44.535 --> 01:03:46.639
That the bosses okayed
Nader's recruitment."

01:03:48.305 --> 01:03:49.638
So...

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.977
he takes a swig
straight out of the bottle.

01:03:53.445 --> 01:03:54.447
And he says,

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.515
"Avram, my dear...

01:03:58.749 --> 01:04:00.352
I haven't got much time."

01:04:02.287 --> 01:04:04.590
And I had no idea what he meant,
so I asked him.

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:08.358
And that's when he told me
about the cancer

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.394
that he'd only just found.

01:04:10.695 --> 01:04:12.131
And he swore me to secrecy.

01:04:13.331 --> 01:04:14.400
And I was crying.

01:04:16.334 --> 01:04:18.200
And he goes...

01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:19.604
"No tears, Avram.

01:04:21.072 --> 01:04:22.173
That's not, um...

01:04:24.675 --> 01:04:26.311
I'm at peace with myself.

01:04:29.213 --> 01:04:30.248
<i>I'm happy."</i>

01:06:20.525 --> 01:06:21.526
Hey.

01:06:23.662 --> 01:06:26.296
Not the smartest thing
to leave your door unlocked.

01:06:29.633 --> 01:06:31.233
Brought you something nice.

01:06:31.235 --> 01:06:32.237
Hot tea.

01:06:40.945 --> 01:06:42.678
That's the first time in my life

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.650
someone's brought me
a cup of tea in bed.

01:06:49.688 --> 01:06:51.588
It's stuffy in here.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:53.559
How about we go out
for a bit of fresh air?

01:06:57.662 --> 01:06:58.595
It'll do you good.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:00.765
You have to promise me
something, Daniel.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:05.271
Don't go making the same
stupid mistakes I made.

01:07:06.905 --> 01:07:08.506
It all goes by so fast.

01:07:09.573 --> 01:07:10.842
You turn your back for a minute,

01:07:11.943 --> 01:07:13.312
suddenly, everyone's gone.

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:16.381
You're all alone.

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.942
I think I'll just have
a quick shower.

01:08:21.478 --> 01:08:22.947
You're a common thief and liar.

01:08:31.955 --> 01:08:33.988
If you promise to hear me out
from start to finish,

01:08:33.991 --> 01:08:35.057
I'll tell you everything.

01:08:35.059 --> 01:08:37.091
If I promise?

01:08:37.094 --> 01:08:38.694
You've been conning me
every step of the way,

01:08:38.696 --> 01:08:39.861
and you almost got away with it.

01:08:39.863 --> 01:08:40.930
- Daniel...
- Shut up.

01:08:40.932 --> 01:08:42.468
Shut the fuck up!

01:08:44.702 --> 01:08:46.272
Do you know what my orders are?

01:08:47.438 --> 01:08:49.671
Do you?

01:08:49.674 --> 01:08:52.006
These are my fucking orders.

01:08:52.009 --> 01:08:54.645
Do you understand?
These are my fucking orders!

01:08:56.947 --> 01:08:59.981
You stole the money
that was meant for the general.

01:08:59.983 --> 01:09:00.986
Just admit it!

01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:06.692
Admit it!

01:09:13.764 --> 01:09:14.895
Fuck.

01:09:14.898 --> 01:09:17.335
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:09:28.712 --> 01:09:29.881
- What?
- Nothing.

01:09:34.385 --> 01:09:35.752
It's just that for 40 years,

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:38.924
you get up every morning,
put on a mask,

01:09:39.957 --> 01:09:41.759
and got and con people.

01:09:43.161 --> 01:09:44.560
And you get applause,

01:09:44.562 --> 01:09:45.898
you get standing ovations.

01:09:47.464 --> 01:09:49.033
And then one day,
without warning...

01:09:50.868 --> 01:09:53.970
they say,
"Leave the mask at reception.

01:09:53.971 --> 01:09:56.571
Thank you very much.
Off you go."

01:09:56.573 --> 01:09:59.508
And it's terrifying, Daniel.

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:03.145
It's terrifying because nobody's
gonna remember you.

01:10:03.147 --> 01:10:06.015
Until one day,
you just drop down. Dead.

01:10:06.017 --> 01:10:07.452
Gone without a trace.

01:10:09.954 --> 01:10:12.922
But you know that as long as
you keep delivering the goods,

01:10:12.924 --> 01:10:15.425
they'll keep you around,
keep you alive

01:10:15.427 --> 01:10:16.461
because they still need you.

01:10:20.197 --> 01:10:22.565
So even though
the general's intel

01:10:22.567 --> 01:10:23.733
was becoming useless,

01:10:23.735 --> 01:10:25.504
I made it look good,

01:10:26.603 --> 01:10:28.104
important, relevant.

01:10:28.106 --> 01:10:29.108
And they bought it.

01:10:34.745 --> 01:10:36.481
Things went wrong when...

01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:40.816
the general gave me this tip

01:10:40.818 --> 01:10:43.151
about the Syrian army
going into high alert,

01:10:43.153 --> 01:10:46.521
and I spiced it up a bit,
as always.

01:10:46.523 --> 01:10:47.457
Next thing you know,

01:10:47.459 --> 01:10:50.059
the military draft in
50,000 reservists

01:10:50.061 --> 01:10:52.664
and tanks on the Syrian border
all for nothing.

01:10:56.468 --> 01:10:58.234
So, the brass
started getting suspicious,

01:10:58.236 --> 01:10:59.601
started...

01:10:59.603 --> 01:11:01.636
triple-checking my reports.

01:11:01.638 --> 01:11:02.775
And then, whammo.

01:11:04.142 --> 01:11:06.775
My dear, old
out-of-touch general

01:11:06.777 --> 01:11:08.845
brings me this lead on Angela.

01:11:08.847 --> 01:11:11.814
And just like
<i>The Boy Who Cried Wolf,</i>

01:11:11.816 --> 01:11:13.719
now that I can bring them
the real deal,

01:11:15.018 --> 01:11:16.088
they wanna kick me out.

01:11:18.255 --> 01:11:19.557
Kick me hard.

01:11:22.259 --> 01:11:23.795
I have nothing, Daniel.

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:29.567
My father left Iraq
some 60 old years ago.

01:11:30.701 --> 01:11:31.836
In Iraq, he was king.

01:11:34.004 --> 01:11:37.105
Went with the undergrounds,
saved Jews in '41.

01:11:37.107 --> 01:11:39.708
Hold the British army
during the war.

01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:42.647
So, in England, he thought
he would continue to be king.

01:11:44.214 --> 01:11:45.550
But no, he was not.

01:11:46.851 --> 01:11:48.687
I saw how hard it was for him.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.489
How no place would have him.

01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:57.959
How he spent his days
either sleeping or drinking.

01:11:57.961 --> 01:12:01.732
Missing Cafe Bouqs where he sat
every day in Baghdad.

01:12:03.034 --> 01:12:04.102
Then he just died.

01:12:07.205 --> 01:12:08.904
And I swore,

01:12:08.906 --> 01:12:10.573
I'll be someone else.

01:12:10.575 --> 01:12:11.641
Someone who matters.

01:12:11.643 --> 01:12:13.011
Why did you sell out my father?

01:12:14.178 --> 01:12:15.214
No, no.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.915
I did no such thing.

01:12:19.851 --> 01:12:21.053
I was gonna take the rap.

01:12:24.022 --> 01:12:25.791
I wanted him
to come out of this clean.

01:12:27.759 --> 01:12:29.127
But what did the moron
go and do?

01:12:30.193 --> 01:12:31.696
Denies the whole thing.

01:12:32.863 --> 01:12:34.230
He wasn't going back to Israel.

01:12:34.232 --> 01:12:35.501
He wanted a child.

01:12:39.237 --> 01:12:41.002
He wanted a child
before he died.

01:12:41.004 --> 01:12:42.607
He was obsessed with the idea.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:44.776
Then he met your mother.

01:12:46.643 --> 01:12:48.112
Immediately got her pregnant
with you.

01:12:50.348 --> 01:12:51.582
Then they got married.

01:13:05.964 --> 01:13:08.898
I will do whatever is needed
to help you,

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.001
and to protect you.

01:13:11.235 --> 01:13:12.638
I appreciate that.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.608
But when
this is all over,

01:13:19.376 --> 01:13:20.678
I will turn you in.

01:13:50.775 --> 01:13:51.777
I'm kosher.

01:13:52.744 --> 01:13:54.679
Yes, I know you are.

01:13:56.313 --> 01:13:57.980
By the way,

01:13:57.982 --> 01:14:00.783
Avram's not sick, is he?

01:14:00.785 --> 01:14:02.885
Not that I'm aware of. Why?

01:14:02.887 --> 01:14:05.287
He's been taking
loads of Verelan.

01:14:05.289 --> 01:14:07.155
Something heart-related.

01:14:07.157 --> 01:14:09.391
He has a heart.
Well, that's new.

01:14:11.062 --> 01:14:13.194
Judging by the way he's looking
at that woman of his,

01:14:13.196 --> 01:14:17.166
I would say
his heart is beating fast.

01:14:17.168 --> 01:14:20.938
That was quite
wonderful, my dear.

01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:51.737
I want you out of here.

01:14:52.704 --> 01:14:53.769
Oh, that.

01:14:53.771 --> 01:14:54.773
Um, I can explain.

01:14:55.473 --> 01:14:56.739
Get out of my house.

01:14:56.741 --> 01:14:57.640
<i>Out of my life.</i>

01:14:57.642 --> 01:14:59.007
<i>But I was gonna tell you...</i>

01:14:59.009 --> 01:14:59.909
<i>Out!</i>

01:14:59.911 --> 01:15:00.912
Ta-ta.

01:15:23.968 --> 01:15:25.467
Hello?

01:15:25.469 --> 01:15:26.968
<i>Dr. Angela Caroni?</i>

01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:28.369
Who wants to know?

01:15:28.371 --> 01:15:29.904
<i>Belgian State Security.</i>

01:15:29.906 --> 01:15:31.075
<i>Just follow us.</i>

01:16:08.979 --> 01:16:09.981
This is the moment.

01:16:10.814 --> 01:16:12.413
We're in the money time.

01:16:12.415 --> 01:16:15.050
How old this place our guest
determine from this moment on.

01:16:15.052 --> 01:16:17.520
I'd put all my chips
on one number.

01:16:17.522 --> 01:16:19.387
Don't be surprised
if you end up broke.

01:16:19.389 --> 01:16:21.323
I won't be surprised
at anything.

01:16:21.325 --> 01:16:22.728
She's gonna take the bite.

01:16:23.393 --> 01:16:24.195
What if she doesn't?

01:16:25.796 --> 01:16:27.299
You know
whom I miss the most right now?

01:16:28.398 --> 01:16:29.735
I miss your dad.

01:16:30.867 --> 01:16:32.303
I miss that son of a bitch.

01:16:34.472 --> 01:16:35.974
So how come we never saw you?

01:16:37.942 --> 01:16:40.476
You never came
to any of the memorial days,

01:16:40.478 --> 01:16:42.343
nothing.

01:16:42.345 --> 01:16:45.146
Hardly ever heard about you
before I signed up.

01:16:45.148 --> 01:16:46.317
Because I couldn't bear it.

01:16:48.518 --> 01:16:49.754
Couldn't you get that?

01:17:00.063 --> 01:17:01.363
I want nothing to do with you.

01:17:01.365 --> 01:17:02.230
Please, just listen.

01:17:02.232 --> 01:17:04.300
And if you don't accept
my explanation,

01:17:04.302 --> 01:17:06.135
then you never have to hear
from me again.

01:17:06.137 --> 01:17:07.368
Just go away.

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:08.604
I don't want any drama.

01:17:08.606 --> 01:17:09.808
You have to listen.

01:17:10.374 --> 01:17:11.940
I lied...

01:17:11.942 --> 01:17:13.309
for absolutely no reason.

01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:14.376
Honestly.

01:17:15.879 --> 01:17:17.346
After Chernobyl...

01:17:17.348 --> 01:17:19.248
I decided
I needed to take action.

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:21.950
And that's how I ended up
co-founding the green activists.

01:17:21.952 --> 01:17:23.918
We're kind of hardcore.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.355
Breaking the law
pretty much everywhere.

01:17:26.357 --> 01:17:28.923
Got people after us,
and I'm undercover.

01:17:29.994 --> 01:17:33.095
So, you're telling me
that I work for a company

01:17:33.097 --> 01:17:35.497
that's actually
your biggest enemy.

01:17:35.499 --> 01:17:37.632
Now I understand
those other reasons.

01:17:37.634 --> 01:17:38.900
Look.

01:17:38.902 --> 01:17:39.905
The end...

01:17:41.504 --> 01:17:43.939
justifies the means.

01:17:43.941 --> 01:17:46.141
And if you have
to put up a front, so be it.

01:17:46.143 --> 01:17:47.109
Yes, it can hurt,

01:17:47.111 --> 01:17:49.645
and sometimes,
it does feel immoral, but...

01:17:49.647 --> 01:17:50.881
You have no other choice.

01:17:53.884 --> 01:17:55.551
So, you chose to fool me.

01:17:55.553 --> 01:17:56.555
No.

01:17:57.354 --> 01:17:58.823
I chose to fall in love.

01:18:35.459 --> 01:18:36.494
Take the flowers.

01:18:39.330 --> 01:18:40.564
That's where
we're meeting tonight.

01:19:02.553 --> 01:19:03.555
Bitch.

01:19:12.095 --> 01:19:13.162
You see?

01:19:13.164 --> 01:19:14.633
I told you
she would take the bait.

01:19:24.607 --> 01:19:27.141
Sorry, the driver took me
somewhere else.

01:19:27.143 --> 01:19:28.444
My assistant, Daniel.

01:19:28.446 --> 01:19:29.744
Daniel, Angela,

01:19:29.746 --> 01:19:31.312
friend and fan of the cause.

01:19:31.314 --> 01:19:33.084
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:43.191
Tonight, we're taking action

01:19:43.193 --> 01:19:46.595
against the company responsible
for the poisoning

01:19:46.597 --> 01:19:49.530
of hundreds,
of thousands of fish.

01:19:49.532 --> 01:19:51.132
The result of a toxic waste

01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:53.168
they've been dumping
into this river.

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:54.235
Now, listen up.

01:19:54.237 --> 01:19:56.404
If anyone gets arrested,

01:19:56.406 --> 01:19:57.506
then the one and only name

01:19:57.508 --> 01:19:59.010
you're gonna be giving up
is mine.

01:20:00.111 --> 01:20:01.379
For those who don't know me,

01:20:02.379 --> 01:20:04.078
I'm John Paul Mondong.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.146
Are we clear?

01:20:05.148 --> 01:20:06.448
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:20:06.450 --> 01:20:07.552
Yes.

01:20:40.683 --> 01:20:42.717
So, what do you think?

01:20:42.719 --> 01:20:45.553
I think I might be able
to help you guys.

01:20:45.555 --> 01:20:47.789
He's an impressive man.

01:20:47.791 --> 01:20:49.494
Yeah, inspiring.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.102
I'm worried about him.

01:21:00.237 --> 01:21:01.406
I'm worried about his heart.

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:04.541
I'm taking good care of it.

01:21:10.714 --> 01:21:13.614
<i>I really admire
your dedication.</i>

01:21:13.616 --> 01:21:15.583
<i>I used to dream
of going to Syria</i>

01:21:15.585 --> 01:21:18.453
<i>to help those poor refugees.</i>

01:21:18.455 --> 01:21:21.390
I would adopt a Syrian kid
without a second thought.

01:21:21.392 --> 01:21:22.727
They've really touched my heart.

01:21:30.267 --> 01:21:31.269
What?

01:21:32.736 --> 01:21:33.772
Nothing. All good.

01:21:35.738 --> 01:21:37.239
Come on, tell me.

01:21:37.241 --> 01:21:38.276
It's just...

01:21:39.175 --> 01:21:40.374
It's not child's play.

01:21:40.376 --> 01:21:41.446
It's very risky business.

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:43.814
I know what I'm doing.

01:21:44.814 --> 01:21:46.547
If you're right about Viro,

01:21:46.549 --> 01:21:47.815
<i>I'd be happy
to help you.</i>

01:21:47.817 --> 01:21:49.083
<i>Really.</i>

01:21:49.085 --> 01:21:51.352
<i>Well, the file
we're looking for is called</i>

01:21:51.354 --> 01:21:53.221
<i>the "Spider In The Web"</i>

01:21:53.223 --> 01:21:54.789
<i>I just hope you can find it.</i>

01:21:54.791 --> 01:21:56.557
<i>You just have
to trust me a little.</i>

01:21:56.559 --> 01:21:58.263
<i>It will do you good.</i>

01:21:59.295 --> 01:22:00.361
Want to join me?

01:22:00.363 --> 01:22:01.366
In a minute.

01:22:12.809 --> 01:22:13.812
I love you.

01:22:15.345 --> 01:22:16.481
I can't hear you.

01:22:18.415 --> 01:22:20.382
I said, I love you.

01:22:20.384 --> 01:22:21.486
<i>No, you don't.</i>

01:22:22.486 --> 01:22:23.488
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

01:22:24.888 --> 01:22:26.123
<i>I really do.</i>

01:22:44.775 --> 01:22:46.608
How are you, Dr. Caroni?

01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:48.743
<i>I'm well, thank you.
And you?</i>

01:22:48.745 --> 01:22:50.412
<i>Thank you. Have a nice day.</i>

01:22:50.414 --> 01:22:51.416
<i>You, too.</i>

01:22:52.383 --> 01:22:53.384
<i>Good morning.</i>

01:23:10.233 --> 01:23:11.365
<i>Listen.</i>

01:23:11.367 --> 01:23:12.668
<i>The "Spider In The Web"</i>

01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:16.471
<i>can be found only in
the restricted area computers.</i>

01:23:16.473 --> 01:23:18.774
It will be very complicated
to break into them,

01:23:18.776 --> 01:23:20.542
but don't worry,
I'll find a way.

01:23:20.544 --> 01:23:22.677
It's you I'm worried about.

01:23:22.679 --> 01:23:24.579
I don't want you getting hurt.

01:23:24.581 --> 01:23:26.582
You're my responsibility.

01:23:26.584 --> 01:23:29.217
I'm about to get my hands
on the documents.

01:23:29.219 --> 01:23:30.418
We can't stop now.

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:31.923
- "We"?
- Yes, we.

01:23:33.857 --> 01:23:34.758
I'm pulling the plug.

01:23:37.695 --> 01:23:39.461
I know exactly
what we have to do.

01:23:39.463 --> 01:23:40.465
Trust me.

01:23:42.299 --> 01:23:43.398
I'm pulling the plug.

01:23:52.009 --> 01:23:53.742
Have you totally lost
your mind?

01:23:53.744 --> 01:23:54.743
She'll get caught.

01:23:54.745 --> 01:23:56.979
The system will latch
onto the security breach

01:23:56.981 --> 01:23:57.879
in two seconds.

01:23:57.881 --> 01:23:59.648
Not with that flash drive
we gave her.

01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:00.583
It's literally untraceable.

01:24:00.585 --> 01:24:02.583
I don't trust technology,
you know that.

01:24:02.585 --> 01:24:04.352
Their security system's
a tough one.

01:24:04.354 --> 01:24:06.254
We should find another way
to do this.

01:24:06.256 --> 01:24:07.823
Avram, stop thinking
with your dick

01:24:07.825 --> 01:24:08.693
and use your brain.

01:24:10.728 --> 01:24:12.261
If I don't have
all the documents with me

01:24:12.263 --> 01:24:14.629
within the next 24 hours,

01:24:14.631 --> 01:24:16.864
I will personally make sure
they put you on trial

01:24:16.866 --> 01:24:19.001
and lock your ass up
in an egg cell.

01:24:19.003 --> 01:24:20.705
No one will know
you ever existed.

01:24:21.972 --> 01:24:22.974
Am I clear?

01:24:24.275 --> 01:24:25.476
Twenty-four hours.

01:24:27.544 --> 01:24:28.610
Daniel.

01:24:46.796 --> 01:24:47.799
Hm?

01:25:19.662 --> 01:25:21.031
So, explain to me again.

01:25:22.398 --> 01:25:23.832
She doesn't have clearance

01:25:23.834 --> 01:25:26.334
to access the restricted area.

01:25:26.336 --> 01:25:28.372
The guy
you're about to meet does.

01:25:28.738 --> 01:25:29.741
Easy.

01:25:31.674 --> 01:25:33.074
Easy. So what do I have to do...

01:25:33.076 --> 01:25:34.278
Wait.

01:25:36.714 --> 01:25:37.814
Now's your chance.

01:25:39.015 --> 01:25:40.082
That guy?

01:25:40.084 --> 01:25:41.350
He's a guard at Viro.

01:25:41.352 --> 01:25:42.586
He's on the late-night shift.

01:26:01.738 --> 01:26:02.740
Hey.

01:26:05.942 --> 01:26:07.575
- Cheers, my friend.
- Cheers.

01:26:07.577 --> 01:26:10.013
So, it was really nice
meeting you, man.

01:26:10.848 --> 01:26:11.916
See ya.

01:26:28.564 --> 01:26:29.797
<i>I'm arriving now.</i>

01:26:29.799 --> 01:26:31.166
<i>I'm already inside.</i>

01:26:31.168 --> 01:26:32.167
<i>You don't have a lot of time</i>

01:26:32.169 --> 01:26:33.868
<i>before the morning
shift arrives.</i>

01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:35.102
- <i>Be careful.</i>
- <i>You, too.</i>

01:26:46.582 --> 01:26:47.949
Thank you, doctor.

01:26:52.622 --> 01:26:54.455
I don't know what's happening.

01:26:54.457 --> 01:26:55.856
I'm... I was sick whole night,

01:26:55.858 --> 01:26:56.992
and I'm never sick.

01:26:56.994 --> 01:26:59.127
Well, we've all
gotta be sick sometime.

01:26:59.129 --> 01:27:00.865
So that our mothers can...

01:27:02.198 --> 01:27:03.498
look after us.

01:27:04.567 --> 01:27:05.766
Give us a big hug.

01:27:10.107 --> 01:27:12.610
Give it 24 hours.

01:27:15.144 --> 01:27:16.714
You'll be as good as new.

01:27:20.082 --> 01:27:21.716
Ha, come on, son.

01:27:21.718 --> 01:27:22.784
Let's get you home.

01:27:33.597 --> 01:27:34.799
- Thirty minutes.
- Okay.

01:27:50.214 --> 01:27:52.047
Take this guy out of here.

01:28:02.759 --> 01:28:03.824
Are you okay?

01:28:03.826 --> 01:28:05.126
It's nothing.

01:28:14.204 --> 01:28:15.537
Hey, stop!

01:28:15.539 --> 01:28:16.605
Hey. Oh, no. No.

01:28:16.607 --> 01:28:18.773
- I need to go in for a second.
- You can't go in.

01:28:18.775 --> 01:28:20.007
No, you can't go in.

01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:35.593
- Can you stand?
- Let's go.

01:28:41.898 --> 01:28:43.731
Drop us off at my car.

01:29:00.918 --> 01:29:02.583
You all right?

01:29:02.585 --> 01:29:03.687
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:29:08.759 --> 01:29:11.095
Now I'm starting to think
she might be an extraction.

01:29:12.094 --> 01:29:14.229
You've gotta calm down.

01:29:14.231 --> 01:29:16.501
Everything is under control.

01:29:24.607 --> 01:29:25.610
I'm in.

01:29:48.165 --> 01:29:50.364
<i>It's going to take
20 minutes to download.</i>

01:29:50.366 --> 01:29:51.701
Shit.

01:30:37.179 --> 01:30:38.245
What is this?

01:30:38.247 --> 01:30:39.681
You sent over the wrong files.

01:30:39.683 --> 01:30:41.052
No, this is everything she got.

01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:49.259
There's got to be more.

01:30:53.397 --> 01:30:55.062
This is nothing.

01:30:55.064 --> 01:30:57.032
What do you mean it's nothing?

01:30:57.034 --> 01:30:58.667
This is the file
we were after.

01:30:58.669 --> 01:31:00.168
Where is the smoking gun?

01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:01.606
This is all there is.

01:31:13.282 --> 01:31:14.285
Daniel.

01:31:23.927 --> 01:31:25.827
He's coming with us.

01:31:25.829 --> 01:31:27.061
You're done here. Thank you.

01:31:27.063 --> 01:31:28.262
As far as she is concerned,

01:31:28.264 --> 01:31:29.864
she carries the sun
and the moon.

01:31:29.866 --> 01:31:31.399
Brave girl.

01:31:31.401 --> 01:31:33.234
Risking her life
the way she did,

01:31:33.236 --> 01:31:34.802
and for what?

01:31:34.804 --> 01:31:36.904
I thought
we can keep this civilized.

01:31:36.906 --> 01:31:39.106
I didn't want
to shame you, Avram.

01:31:39.108 --> 01:31:42.177
But the entire
investigation report came in.

01:31:42.179 --> 01:31:44.378
Out of a total of ten reports
you signed off,

01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:46.881
you, in fact,
saw the general only twice

01:31:46.883 --> 01:31:48.085
in the last two years.

01:31:48.852 --> 01:31:51.052
Twice!

01:31:51.054 --> 01:31:53.224
A warrant for your arrest
has already been issued.

01:31:54.924 --> 01:31:55.925
I'm sorry, Samuel.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.429
He stays with me.

01:31:59.963 --> 01:32:01.064
I'm warning you.

01:32:01.865 --> 01:32:03.166
Stay out of this.

01:32:09.106 --> 01:32:11.275
I'm in charge
until we finish this.

01:32:13.343 --> 01:32:14.778
You're both insane.

01:32:16.146 --> 01:32:17.380
Daniel, that's enough.

01:32:19.049 --> 01:32:20.151
Give him the gun.

01:32:21.084 --> 01:32:22.086
You go with them.

01:32:24.086 --> 01:32:25.486
No, that's not right.

01:32:35.232 --> 01:32:36.767
I'm one step behind you.

01:33:39.094 --> 01:33:41.531
If anything should happen to me,
I want you to have this.

01:33:42.531 --> 01:33:43.534
It's the keys...

01:33:45.402 --> 01:33:47.805
to everything I have
in the store in Brussels.

01:33:49.339 --> 01:33:50.474
You'll figure it out.

01:33:51.942 --> 01:33:53.507
Just don't tell anyone.

01:33:53.509 --> 01:33:55.178
No, no.

01:33:56.879 --> 01:33:57.881
You'll be fine.

01:34:00.015 --> 01:34:01.018
I don't need anything.

01:34:02.285 --> 01:34:04.255
A couple of years ago,
I had a mild stroke.

01:34:06.956 --> 01:34:08.959
Got on the train,
everything went dark.

01:34:12.262 --> 01:34:13.831
That's how I feel now, Daniel.

01:34:16.433 --> 01:34:17.434
I'm done.

01:34:19.936 --> 01:34:22.169
We should head to the airport
and get on that flight.

01:34:22.171 --> 01:34:23.339
You're not going back with me.

01:34:25.608 --> 01:34:27.044
They'll bury you back home.

01:34:29.045 --> 01:34:31.282
You turn up without me,
and they'll bury you.

01:34:33.515 --> 01:34:36.085
Especially after that stunt
you pulled with Samuel.

01:34:37.053 --> 01:34:38.354
That wasn't very smart.

01:34:39.155 --> 01:34:40.191
Not very smart...

01:34:42.893 --> 01:34:43.894
but effective.

01:35:00.309 --> 01:35:01.312
We should go.

01:35:04.446 --> 01:35:06.449
I'll stay behind,
fix a few things...

01:35:08.018 --> 01:35:09.119
then I'll give myself up.

01:35:15.392 --> 01:35:17.158
Don't worry about me.

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.092
I'll just put the blame on you
as always.

01:35:23.066 --> 01:35:24.335
I kept something for you.

01:35:53.196 --> 01:35:54.198
Go on.

01:36:30.099 --> 01:36:31.535
Wait here a second, okay?

01:36:37.006 --> 01:36:39.076
I appreciate you
coming so quickly.

01:36:40.175 --> 01:36:42.043
Are we friends or what?

01:36:42.045 --> 01:36:43.177
We've left the club for you.

01:36:43.179 --> 01:36:45.113
- I need to talk to you.
- Bad answer.

01:36:47.317 --> 01:36:48.416
I think she's in trouble

01:36:48.418 --> 01:36:49.452
and I'd appreciate it...

01:36:54.723 --> 01:36:56.391
Pleasure to meet you finally.

01:36:56.393 --> 01:36:57.394
Likewise.

01:37:09.571 --> 01:37:11.074
Tell me what the problem is.

01:37:13.643 --> 01:37:16.077
<i>You have
reached Dr. Angela Caroni.</i>

01:37:16.079 --> 01:37:18.046
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:37:18.048 --> 01:37:21.215
<i>Where are you?
You're not answering your phone.</i>

01:37:21.217 --> 01:37:23.019
<i>Come as quickly as you can.
We're in danger.</i>

01:41:20.322 --> 01:41:21.592
I thought I locked the door.

01:41:22.692 --> 01:41:23.827
I have the keys.

01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:28.397
In fact, I own the place.

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:32.002
I thought you were leaving.

01:41:34.836 --> 01:41:35.839
You know me.

01:41:36.872 --> 01:41:38.739
Need to get the job done.

01:41:38.741 --> 01:41:39.873
Yeah.

01:41:39.875 --> 01:41:42.012
That was always
your biggest problem.

01:41:46.515 --> 01:41:47.517
Sublime.

01:41:49.552 --> 01:41:50.754
All we need now...

01:41:51.821 --> 01:41:53.390
is a glass of good Cognac.

01:41:54.357 --> 01:41:56.860
Sorry, I'm on duty.

01:41:58.661 --> 01:42:00.560
Meanwhile,

01:42:00.562 --> 01:42:03.596
I see you've been looking out
for number one.

01:42:03.598 --> 01:42:05.034
Did what everyone else does.

01:42:06.068 --> 01:42:07.467
Want us to make sure

01:42:07.469 --> 01:42:10.604
we're sitting pretty
before retirement.

01:42:10.606 --> 01:42:11.739
You know how it goes.

01:42:11.741 --> 01:42:14.378
If it hadn't been me,
would've just been someone else.

01:42:15.611 --> 01:42:16.647
Hm.

01:42:18.513 --> 01:42:19.782
Your wife's ring.

01:42:21.451 --> 01:42:24.017
That was meant for Anne-Marie,
the general's lover?

01:42:24.019 --> 01:42:25.852
That wasn't very fair.

01:42:25.854 --> 01:42:28.291
That was your biggest mistake.

01:42:29.858 --> 01:42:30.927
It wasn't the general.

01:42:31.626 --> 01:42:33.727
It was me.

01:42:33.729 --> 01:42:36.029
When Mussad
started sniffing around Viro,

01:42:36.031 --> 01:42:37.998
when they was starting
to get suspicious of Viro,

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.065
I threatened the general

01:42:39.067 --> 01:42:41.502
that if he wouldn't give you
the lead to Angela,

01:42:41.504 --> 01:42:42.703
I would kill Anne-Marie.

01:42:42.705 --> 01:42:43.837
And from that point on,

01:42:43.839 --> 01:42:46.640
it all just played out nicely.

01:42:46.642 --> 01:42:49.008
You, Grand Maestro Adereth,

01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:50.813
cleared Viro's name.

01:42:52.848 --> 01:42:54.383
Why did you have to hurt him?

01:42:56.786 --> 01:42:57.854
And her?

01:42:58.754 --> 01:42:59.889
That, I don't get.

01:43:00.956 --> 01:43:02.623
It was a threat.

01:43:02.625 --> 01:43:04.925
It was easy, really.
I just leaked it to the Syrians,

01:43:04.927 --> 01:43:06.092
and they took care of the rest.

01:43:06.094 --> 01:43:07.763
She was just an afterthought.

01:43:08.531 --> 01:43:09.533
Cleaning up.

01:43:11.666 --> 01:43:12.736
So...

01:43:13.803 --> 01:43:15.604
how come
they didn't go after me?

01:43:16.438 --> 01:43:17.673
Hmm.

01:43:18.808 --> 01:43:21.645
Love has really
dulled your senses.

01:43:38.628 --> 01:43:39.629
I'm sorry.

01:43:41.563 --> 01:43:43.797
You should know
that I really thought I...

01:43:55.478 --> 01:43:57.114
She was the best I had.

01:44:01.616 --> 01:44:03.450
I needed someone
who could be your match,

01:44:03.452 --> 01:44:06.119
and she had motivation.

01:44:06.121 --> 01:44:08.455
Her real name
was Amal Halinem.

01:44:08.457 --> 01:44:09.789
Her father
was a Syrian businessman

01:44:09.791 --> 01:44:11.460
that your people killed
years ago.

01:44:16.832 --> 01:44:17.834
I'm so sorry.

01:44:20.803 --> 01:44:22.171
Good that
you found those photos.

01:44:27.876 --> 01:44:29.142
You surely realized

01:44:29.144 --> 01:44:31.011
what she was holding on to then?

01:44:31.013 --> 01:44:33.183
Obviously, planning
to blackmail me later.

01:44:38.554 --> 01:44:39.823
I was always careful.

01:44:40.923 --> 01:44:41.992
You know me.

01:44:44.626 --> 01:44:45.661
Yes.

01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:56.139
I feel so sad, my friend.

01:45:20.696 --> 01:45:22.695
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:45:22.697 --> 01:45:24.532
<i>we're about to land...</i>
