WEBVTT

00:04.308 --> 00:05.831
- No!

00:05.875 --> 00:08.051
- Is there any chance
the Vas-COM caused this?

00:08.095 --> 00:09.313
- It's certainly possible.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.185
- Then Dr. Cooper
may have killed her.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.187
- Dr. Marcel,
I already told you--

00:13.230 --> 00:14.710
- Back off, Dr. Blake.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.103
I'm considering applying

00:16.146 --> 00:18.018
for a fellowship
in transplant surgery.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.542
<i>- Did you get any sleep
last night?</i>

00:20.585 --> 00:21.760
- Didn't we just have
this conversation?

00:21.804 --> 00:23.675
- I was mothering you,
and I shouldn't.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.025
I won't do it again.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.157
- You've essentially been
parenting your mother.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.767
- I don't want to be here!

00:28.811 --> 00:30.160
- Do you know anyone
I can call

00:30.204 --> 00:32.293
to get
an illegally-parked van towed?

00:32.336 --> 00:34.599
- It's gone!
They towed it.

00:34.643 --> 00:37.385
- Stay with me tonight, okay?
We'll figure it out.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.736
- Oh, you'll know this one.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.868
Outdated surgical
procedure misused

00:42.912 --> 00:45.523
to treat mental disorders.
Eight letters.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.786
- Breakfast.
- Too many letters.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.049
- Can I see your arm?

00:50.833 --> 00:53.836
- Oh, sorry.
It was in the bathroom.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.707
It just looked so--
- No, no, no. No, wear it.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.058
No, it looks good on you.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.235
That's looking better.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.672
- I should hope so.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.891
I'm a model patient.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.545
- Could use some improvement

01:07.589 --> 01:10.200
in the roommate department,
though.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.290
Think maybe you could
clean up a little bit

01:13.334 --> 01:14.683
while I'm at work today?

01:14.726 --> 01:17.120
- Wouldn't be an issue
if you loaned me the $500

01:17.164 --> 01:18.426
to get my van
out of the impound.

01:18.469 --> 01:19.731
- I already told you.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.646
Money's tight
until the end of the month.

01:21.690 --> 01:24.910
- Some anonymous jerk makes
a phone call, and like that,

01:24.954 --> 01:27.826
I'm out of my home
and a pile of cash.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.742
Seem fair to you?

01:30.786 --> 01:32.570
- Mom, I promise
I'm gonna help you.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.746
But at least right now,
you have a roof over your head.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.445
- And a doting daughter.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.405
- I gotta run.
I'm late for work.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.409
Lobotomy. Eight letters.

01:45.453 --> 01:48.151
- Oh, oh, oh.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.892
- What I was saying
was like, hey, Trish--

01:49.935 --> 01:50.893
- Hey.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.721
You two are so cute together.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.375
Anyone ever tell you
that you could be sisters?

01:54.418 --> 01:58.161
- Oh, come on, girl.
Say it again. [chuckles]

01:58.205 --> 01:59.728
Come on.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.251
Oh, trust me.
That was meant more

02:01.295 --> 02:03.514
as a compliment to me
than an insult to you.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.908
- Why would she say
we look alike?

02:05.951 --> 02:07.605
Does she know about us?

02:07.649 --> 02:09.433
- Trish? No.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.740
- Okay, that makes it sound
like there's someone who does.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.178
I'm right. Somebody does know.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.441
- Okay, yes. Sharon does.
- Ms. Goodwin?

02:17.485 --> 02:18.703
Is that how I got this job?

02:18.747 --> 02:19.922
- No, I can assure you that.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.402
No,
it almost worked against you.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.317
Sharon was very reticent
when she found out.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.579
- So she doesn't
even want me here?

02:24.622 --> 02:26.189
- That's not what
I'm trying to say.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.451
- Does anyone actually think
that I belong here?

02:27.495 --> 02:29.149
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:30.585 --> 02:33.240
- No one else knows. I swear.
- Okay.

02:34.371 --> 02:35.764
- Except for Dr. Charles.
- What?

02:35.807 --> 02:37.200
Oh, my God, everyone's gonna
think that I'm here

02:37.244 --> 02:38.680
because of nepotism.
- It was in confidence.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.464
I promise, he's not gonna
tell anybody, I swear.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.292
- Okay,
but she knows, Maggie.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.816
- Vanessa, you don't have
to prove yourself to anybody.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.776
We've got a trauma incoming.
We're up.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.302
- Astrid Meadows, 21 years old,

02:52.346 --> 02:53.999
punched her fist
through a plate glass window.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.958
- Looked like arterial bleeding
at the forearm.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.481
Controlled with a tourniquet.

02:57.525 --> 02:58.656
- All right. Astrid,
I'm Dr. Taylor.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.831
We're going to
take care of you.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.877
- Oh, my God,
they're still here!

03:01.920 --> 03:04.575
- Who's still here?
- The snakes.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.490
They're coming
out of the vents.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.275
Why isn't anybody
doing anything?

03:08.318 --> 03:09.580
- We think
she might be tripping.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.887
- Okay. On my count.
One, two, three.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.542
- Thank you, gentlemen.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.674
Let's get her on monitors
and hang a new bag.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.850
- Okay, let's set up
a CBC, BMP,

03:18.894 --> 03:20.635
and send the blood
for a full tox.

03:20.678 --> 03:21.853
Let's open up a minor tray.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.290
- You got it.
- Okay.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.596
Relax for me, relax for me.
Thank you.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.512
Okay, Astrid, let's see
what we're dealing with here.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.385
It's definitely
the radial artery.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.864
- Ow!
- Let's inflate this cuff.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.563
- All right, here you go,
sweetie. Yes.

03:35.606 --> 03:37.956
There you go.
- Two hemostats.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.525
- Please!
Please, just make them stop.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.353
- Hold on, sweetie.
Hold on, hold on.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.050
- Just hang in there.

03:45.094 --> 03:46.530
Okay, bleeding's under control.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.967
Let's get this tied up.
Get me 2-0 silk ties.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.447
- I'll get you
an extra set of hands.

03:50.491 --> 03:51.492
- Okay.

03:52.710 --> 03:56.714
- Erika, can you go help
Dr. Taylor, please? Thank you.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.977
[indistinct chatter]

03:59.021 --> 04:01.545
- Why is everyone
standing around?

04:01.589 --> 04:02.851
Excuse me.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.856
- Hey, Mags.
Long time no see.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.250
- Dr. Choi.

04:16.908 --> 04:20.825
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

04:26.353 --> 04:28.093
- All right, everybody
get back to work, yeah.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.443
- Hey, listen.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.401
Whenever you find time,
first round's on you.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.142
- [chuckles]

04:33.185 --> 04:35.753
- Hey.
Great to have you back, man.

04:35.797 --> 04:38.016
- Thanks, man. You too.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.063
- Gotta say, bud, the cane?
Nice touch.

04:41.106 --> 04:43.021
- Ah, it's just
a temporary thing.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.850
- So look,
us gunshot survivors,

04:45.894 --> 04:47.243
we got to stick together.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.419
You know what I'm saying?
So, I'm around.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.378
- I appreciate it.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.162
- Great to have you back.
- Thanks.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.250
Thank you.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.732
Hey.

04:57.775 --> 05:01.170
- So, I take it your
physical therapy's gone well?

05:01.213 --> 05:03.172
- I'm feeling stronger
every day.

05:03.215 --> 05:06.349
Just--just trying my best to
stay out from under the knife.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.829
- Glad to hear it.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.005
And Dr. Archer tells me
you're feeling

05:10.048 --> 05:11.485
like you're ready to come back.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.443
- Yes, ma'am.
- We'd be happy to have him.

05:13.487 --> 05:17.055
- Hospital policy is you have
to undergo evaluation

05:17.099 --> 05:19.014
before coming back
from an injury.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.842
- I've been staying up-to-date
with the journals

05:20.885 --> 05:22.365
and the latest COVID protocols.

05:22.409 --> 05:25.194
- Good. Well,
if you two will excuse me.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.763
It's good to have you back,
Dr. Choi.

05:28.806 --> 05:29.938
- Thank you, ma'am.

05:32.244 --> 05:35.944
- Okay, let's hit the sim lab
and see if we can help you get

05:35.987 --> 05:37.467
your sea legs back again, eh?

05:37.511 --> 05:39.991
- Dean, I never got the chance
to thank you in person.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.167
- Trying to sweet talk your way
out of this eval?

05:42.211 --> 05:43.386
- I'm serious, man.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.040
You pushed
for my spinal reconstruction.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.998
Without you, I probably
wouldn't be standing here.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.307
- Well, you might not have
gotten shot

05:51.351 --> 05:52.874
if it weren't for me.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.789
Don't think that hasn't been
keeping me up at night.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.094
[elevator dings]

05:57.052 --> 06:01.099
- Hey, uh, you know,
we're already past that.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.058
No need to look back, right?

06:03.101 --> 06:06.888
And can't say I wouldn't
take a bullet for you.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.107
- Okay, liver function's
looking good.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.503
Incision's healing nicely.
No sign of infection.

06:13.547 --> 06:16.550
Did a pretty good job,
if I say so myself.

06:16.593 --> 06:19.204
- That's good. Would've been
awkward if I had to sue you.

06:19.248 --> 06:22.077
- Oh, right?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.948
- Thanks.
- You okay?

06:25.428 --> 06:28.997
So, unless you notice
any changes, we'll see you

06:29.040 --> 06:31.086
in a couple of weeks
for a final checkup.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.609
- A couple weeks?
- Yeah.

06:32.653 --> 06:35.525
- I'll have to find an excuse
to see you before that.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.440
How about drinks?

06:37.484 --> 06:40.312
- Oh, Avery,

06:40.356 --> 06:42.924
I don't think it's appropriate
for me to date a patient.

06:42.967 --> 06:47.319
- I was just saying drinks
but I mean, yeah, a date works.

06:49.931 --> 06:53.238
Well, I should let you
get back to my mother.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.197
Still trying out for the team?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.982
- Yeah.

06:58.026 --> 07:01.072
Been shadowing
the past few weeks.

07:01.116 --> 07:04.554
Observed a pancreatic
transplant the other day.

07:04.598 --> 07:07.949
Your mother's
a very talented surgeon.

07:07.992 --> 07:11.169
- And she grants you
the privilege of observing.

07:11.213 --> 07:14.346
I didn't peg you as the type
to sit on the sidelines.

07:14.390 --> 07:19.874
But hey, you decide
you're ready to play,

07:19.917 --> 07:22.267
you know how to reach me.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.532
- A full bar the whole day.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.143
They have--if you're hungry
and there's food, whatever,

07:28.186 --> 07:30.101
there's things like lobster
and crab legs.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.234
There's all kind of canapés.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.630
- Inconclusive.
Neither Cooper nor the Vas-COM

07:36.673 --> 07:38.501
were deemed responsible
for Eleanor Holt's death.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.590
- Now, they're aware
that Cooper inserted

07:40.634 --> 07:42.331
that monitor twice, right?

07:42.374 --> 07:44.855
Even after you raised questions
about its safety?

07:44.899 --> 07:47.641
- I mean, were his clinical
decisions questionable? Yes.

07:47.684 --> 07:50.034
But no one seemed comfortable
saying he was negligent.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.646
- A patient died on our watch,
Dr. Halstead.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.648
Someone needs
to be held responsible.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.476
- I'm going to that critical
care conference

07:56.519 --> 07:57.912
with Matt today.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.522
Maybe he'll open up
in a more social environment.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.524
- Yeah. Maybe.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.921
- So, these snakes
that you saw earlier today,

08:06.964 --> 08:08.879
when you punched
through the window,

08:08.923 --> 08:11.534
were you trying to--to
get away from them?

08:11.578 --> 08:13.493
Were you trying to escape?

08:13.536 --> 08:15.016
- I'm tired.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.496
I don't really feel
like talking.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.193
- All right, well then,
why don't you get

08:18.236 --> 08:21.675
a little rest, and then maybe
we talk some more later?

08:21.718 --> 08:25.026
- Yeah.
- All right.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.941
Nice to meet you, Astrid.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.989
- I thought the hallucinations
were drug-induced,

08:32.033 --> 08:33.251
but the tox screen
came back negative

08:33.295 --> 08:34.557
for controlled substances.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.473
- Okay, so we can cross
those off our list.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.606
- You think this might be
some kind of psychotic break?

08:39.649 --> 08:40.694
- Maybe.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.217
You know,
could be schizophrenia.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.566
I mean, she's the age

08:43.610 --> 08:45.394
when these things
start to present themselves.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.700
- She was saying
that her hallucinations

08:46.743 --> 08:48.266
were more visual
in nature, correct?

08:48.310 --> 08:50.965
- Snakes, yeah.
- Isn't schizophrenia mostly

08:51.008 --> 08:53.576
associated with hallucinations
in the audio modality?

08:53.620 --> 08:55.709
I--I was reading
about this study in 2014

08:55.752 --> 08:57.319
with the Oxford University
Press.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.234
They cited a close to
two to one prevalence.

08:59.277 --> 09:01.410
- Two to one--for me,
that's still unsettled science.

09:01.453 --> 09:05.022
- Dr. Charles, Dr. Taylor,
these are Astrid's parents.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.937
Becky and Tom Meadows.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.679
- My baby?
- Yeah.

09:09.723 --> 09:12.029
- I understand
you're a psychiatrist?

09:12.073 --> 09:14.075
I wanted to talk to you
about the possibility

09:14.118 --> 09:16.425
of keeping Astrid here
on a psych hold.

09:16.468 --> 09:18.253
- You know, Mr. Meadows,
I--I haven't been able

09:18.296 --> 09:20.255
to properly evaluate
your daughter yet.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.649
- This all started
about six months ago.

09:22.692 --> 09:25.303
Overnight it seemed, bam,
the hallucinations,

09:25.347 --> 09:26.478
the erratic behavior.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.393
We--we can't
protect her anymore.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.091
- Did you talk to him
about having her committed?

09:30.134 --> 09:31.745
- You know, I would really love
to hear more about

09:31.788 --> 09:33.442
your daughter's history.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.270
Maybe we can find someplace
more private and talk a bit?

09:35.313 --> 09:37.228
- Sure.
- Great. Thank you.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.147
- Baghdad!

09:43.191 --> 09:44.235
- Nathan Daniels.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.411
40-year-old male,
high speed MVC.

09:46.455 --> 09:49.763
Significant c-spine deformity.
GCS 3.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.635
Heart rate 105. BP 120/66.

09:52.679 --> 09:55.116
- His son's in the ambo
behind us.

09:57.684 --> 10:01.601
- Okay, on my count, gently.
One, two, three.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.131
Pupils are reactive.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.439
Feeling a bony step-off
on the c-spine.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.620
Diminished breath sounds,
left side. We need an X-ray.

10:20.663 --> 10:21.664
- Yep.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.149
- Non-reactive to pain
in the lower extremities.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.108
- X-ray.
- Clear.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.285
White out in the left lung.
Hemothorax.

10:34.329 --> 10:37.071
- Heart rate's 130,
BP's down 90/55.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.420
- Give me a chest tube kit.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.522
I'm in.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.483
- C-spine's clear.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.311
- Where--where's my Dad?
Is he okay?

11:00.355 --> 11:01.443
- Yeah.
My friend Dr. Hammer's

11:01.486 --> 11:02.749
taking care
of him right over there.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.664
- I--I need to see him.
- Hey, EJ, EJ.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.491
Look, look,
I know you're worried,

11:06.535 --> 11:08.232
but right now
let's just stay focused on you

11:08.276 --> 11:11.627
for a bit longer, okay?
Gotta check out that arm.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.065
- [grunts]

11:15.109 --> 11:16.110
- Clear.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.507
- Mid-shaft radial fracture
with mild angulation.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.553
EJ, you might need surgery,
but, in the meantime,

11:24.596 --> 11:25.728
is there anyone we can call?

11:25.772 --> 11:27.556
Like your mom
or maybe a grandparent?

11:27.599 --> 11:30.733
- No, he--my dad's
all I have left.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.735
Please, you can't let him die.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.738
Please, you--you have to
let me see him. Please.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.828
- All right. Look, I'm gonna go
check on him right now.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.744
All right? But Nancy here has
to take you for a CT scan.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.354
We have to see
if you have a concussion.

11:43.398 --> 11:46.836
I know. It'll be all right.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.186
- Okay?
- Okay.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.194
- How's the dad?

11:57.238 --> 11:59.414
- Not good.
Not moving his extremities.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.851
Sending him for a panscan
and a neck CTA.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.462
Stat paged neurosurgery.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.725
- Dad?
- Wait!

12:05.768 --> 12:07.291
- Dad?
- Hold on, hold on.

12:07.335 --> 12:08.771
- Dad? Dad--
- Whoa. Hold up. Hold up, EJ.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.120
wait, wait, no. Hold up.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.127
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Come on.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.521
What's wrong with him?
- Come on, come on.

12:19.564 --> 12:22.306
You don't need to see this.
Come on.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.188
- Hey, Dr. Blake.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.016
I saw we found a liver
for our patient, Sheldon West.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.801
- Take a look.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.456
- Oh, yeah.
Labs look good.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.588
No abnormalities. Very nice.

12:43.632 --> 12:46.461
- Note the measurements.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.158
The donor liver's too large
for Sheldon's abdomen.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.899
- So what?
You're not going to accept?

12:49.943 --> 12:51.335
- Well, as a rule,

12:51.379 --> 12:54.425
I don't like forcing
square pegs into round holes.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.427
- Yeah, but Sheldon's got
a MELD score of 38.

12:56.471 --> 12:57.820
He's running out of time.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.474
- He'll tolerate another
round of liver dialysis

12:59.517 --> 13:01.519
while we wait
for a better match.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.829
- Uh, Dr. Blake.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.962
Sorry, if you'd indulge me,

13:09.005 --> 13:11.834
what about a hepatectomy?
Trim the liver to size?

13:11.878 --> 13:13.531
- That adds time
to the procedure

13:13.575 --> 13:14.794
that Sheldon won't have.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.839
- Well, I've done dozens
out of the ED.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.536
If you'll allow me to assist,

13:18.580 --> 13:21.191
I'm confident
I can pull it off.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.768
- Wait, wait, stop.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.857
Is my Dad gonna walk again?

13:34.901 --> 13:37.164
- EJ, right?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.472
It's too early to say.

13:41.516 --> 13:44.606
But he's in good hands
with Dr. Abrams.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.782
Are you off to surgery
for your arm?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.697
- You think it can wait?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.960
I--I don't want anything to
happen to my Dad while I'm out.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.832
- How about I make you a deal?

13:52.875 --> 13:54.964
You stick to your surgery,
and I'll keep you looped in

13:55.008 --> 13:56.923
before anything happens.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.969
Sound good?

14:00.013 --> 14:02.537
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.669
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

14:06.671 --> 14:07.977
- Thank you.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.631
- So what's the word?

14:09.674 --> 14:14.027
- Mr. Daniels is an ASIA A
at C5. Complete injury.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.203
No motor or sensory functions
below the neck.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.640
- That's catastrophic.
He's tetraplegic.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.642
- That would be my assessment.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.992
I assume you ordered
a CT scan?

14:23.036 --> 14:24.820
- The results just came in.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.866
Bilateral jumped facets
at C5 and 6.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.129
- Well, there's no chance
his cord is getting perfused

14:29.172 --> 14:30.652
when his spine's that maligned.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.262
- We need to get him
in traction now.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.134
- I'll grab the traction cart.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.704
- Okay, sat's at 75.
- Almost got it.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.186
- 70.
You've run out of time, Ethan.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.753
- Come on. Come on.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.668
- 68. He's bradying down.
[machines beeping]

14:46.711 --> 14:48.104
- I'm in. I'm in.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.933
- Nah, that's it. That's it.
Your patient's coding.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.980
[beeping]

14:54.023 --> 14:56.243
- I guess I'm a little rustier
than I thought.

14:56.286 --> 14:58.898
- Are you gonna stand there
while he arrests or what?

15:00.073 --> 15:03.946
- Aye, Chief.
[clears throat]

15:03.990 --> 15:05.121
Starting compressions.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.869
- Dr. Taylor.

15:13.913 --> 15:18.221
- Dr. Charles,
Uh... I didn't see you there.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.136
My allergies were acting up.

15:21.094 --> 15:24.706
- So, I heard that you sent
Astrid Meadows for an MRI?

15:24.749 --> 15:26.969
- I did. Yeah, but not--
but not without cause.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.318
When you were with her parents,

15:28.362 --> 15:30.146
I took the opportunity
to re-examine her,

15:30.190 --> 15:31.191
and I noticed increased tone
in her injured arm,

15:31.234 --> 15:32.714
which is to be expected.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.672
But then I also realized
that it was in her other arm.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.718
- Slow down a little bit.
- Right. Of course. Yes.

15:36.761 --> 15:39.112
So I decided to take note
of the reflexes

15:39.155 --> 15:40.852
that are affected
on both sides of her body.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.724
And then that's when I realized
that something else

15:42.767 --> 15:44.204
might be going on here,
an underlying condition.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.684
Maybe something neurological
or musculoskeletal or--

15:46.728 --> 15:48.208
- Well, you know,
I did give her some Haldol.

15:48.251 --> 15:51.037
Which, you know, could explain
the diminished reflexes.

15:51.080 --> 15:55.737
- Perhaps. Nonetheless, I felt
it prudent to order an MRI.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.782
And honestly,
the results were interesting.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.088
You want to take a look?

15:59.132 --> 16:01.264
You know, if you look here
and here, you can see

16:01.308 --> 16:03.049
the T2 white matter changes.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.398
I mean,
that could be MS, right?

16:04.441 --> 16:06.748
And that could explain
the rigidity in her arms,

16:06.791 --> 16:08.054
or maybe even
the hallucinations.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.272
- You know what?

16:09.316 --> 16:11.057
Interpreting MRIs can be
tricky, all right?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.406
For instance, I mean,
these white matter changes,

16:12.449 --> 16:14.364
they could also
just be normal aging.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.758
I-I think we want to careful
about getting too far ahead

16:16.801 --> 16:18.803
of ourselves here. You know?

16:18.847 --> 16:20.936
- Dr. Taylor?
You got an intake in T3.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.025
- I'll be right there.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.679
I just wanted to be diligent.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.029
- That's great.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.821
- Will Halstead?
We're over here.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.258
- Hi, Jessa.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.912
- Listen, I heard about what
happened to Eleanor Holt,

16:40.956 --> 16:43.045
and I just wanted
to extend my condolences.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.134
- Yeah, thank you.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.136
- There was an
M&M this morning.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.920
What'd they determine?

16:48.964 --> 16:51.967
- That's confidential, Jessa.
I really can't get into it.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.752
- Oh, my gosh, of course.

16:54.796 --> 16:58.408
It's just--I'm just
at the beginning of my career,

16:58.452 --> 17:00.280
and I really don't want
to be associated

17:00.323 --> 17:02.195
with a potentially
defective product.

17:02.238 --> 17:05.067
So I guess what I'm wondering

17:05.111 --> 17:08.201
is do you think
it was the Vas-COM itself,

17:08.244 --> 17:11.682
or was Dr. Cooper
possibly at fault?

17:11.726 --> 17:13.728
- Hey guys, how's it going?
- Matt.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.251
- Hello, Matt!

17:15.295 --> 17:18.080
Um, I was just telling Will
over here how excited I am

17:18.124 --> 17:21.127
to have you both
at the hospitality suite later.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.216
Room 1202.
It's gonna be a blast.

17:23.259 --> 17:28.177
There's canapés and crab legs.
- It sounds fantastic.

17:28.221 --> 17:31.311
I think I'm gonna walk
the floor though first.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.269
Halstead, let's do this.
Ride shotgun with me.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.880
- Yes, sir.
See you later, Jessa.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.144
- Yeah.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.711
- So, Jessa's questioning
my decision-making

17:40.755 --> 17:42.800
in regards to Eleanor's care?

17:42.844 --> 17:44.715
- I wouldn't take it
personally.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.891
I'm sure she's just
protecting her employer.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.198
- That's okay. I, um...

17:50.286 --> 17:54.464
I've been second-guessing
my decisions myself.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.162
- Oh, yeah?

17:56.205 --> 17:57.511
- If you were a bottle
of tequila,

17:57.554 --> 17:59.991
where would you be
hiding right now?

18:02.864 --> 18:04.170
- Great.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.302
Thank you
for responding so quickly.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.130
I promise to be brief.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.872
Over the past few weeks,
we've seen an uptick

18:10.915 --> 18:13.179
in patient complications
in regards

18:13.222 --> 18:15.398
to the Vas-COM cardiac monitor,

18:15.442 --> 18:19.010
including a recent tragic death.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.490
So, starting immediately,

18:20.534 --> 18:24.190
the hospital will discontinue
the use of the Vas-COM

18:24.233 --> 18:27.497
until it can be proven
to be totally safe.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.282
- About damn time.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.762
- Are we sure about the math
on this one?

18:31.806 --> 18:33.373
Maybe we're seeing
more problems with the Vas-COM

18:33.416 --> 18:35.070
but that might be

18:35.114 --> 18:36.811
because there's a lot more
being used than ever before.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.160
- Exactly.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.076
I have 11 in use right now
in cardiac recovery.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.557
Like, what am I supposed to do?
Swap them out?

18:43.600 --> 18:48.170
- Yes. Return to the methods
and devices before Vas-COM.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.085
- That'd be going backward.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.087
You can't tie our hands
like that clinically.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.221
- I'm confident you'll make do.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.137
Thank you all in advance
for your compliance.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.271
- Yep.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.361
- Adding another two pounds.
- Take it slow.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.146
We don't want to damage
the ligaments

19:07.189 --> 19:09.844
any more than they already are.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.802
- All right.
Let's get another image.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.115
Clear.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.334
Okay, alignment looks better.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.987
Should reduce pressure
from the cord.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.469
- Oh, good,
you didn't kill him.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.254
The hospital has been
unable to find

19:28.297 --> 19:30.038
any next of kin of legal age

19:30.081 --> 19:31.866
to make decisions
on Mr. Daniels' behalf,

19:31.909 --> 19:36.479
so the law says it's now
our call on how to proceed.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.046
- So, what are our options?

19:38.089 --> 19:39.830
- Well, given the injury's
to his c-spine,

19:39.874 --> 19:43.051
our only option is an anterior
cervical discectomy and fusion.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.314
- Stabilization is the quickest
road to recovery for Nathan.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.925
- Oh, good.
I'm glad I have your approval.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.537
I've got an OR opening up
in a few hours.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.278
I'll have my team
transfer him up there then.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.323
- Wait,
what about the cord swelling?

19:54.367 --> 19:56.586
You could decompress
it posteriorly, improve flow.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.371
- No, the injury's complete.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.329
Decompression won't restore
function that isn't there.

20:00.373 --> 20:03.289
- But we both know swelling
can mask an incomplete injury.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.594
A more aggressive approach
could restore

20:04.638 --> 20:07.031
his motor function.
Nathan could walk again.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.598
- Not according
to his ASIA results.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.600
The man's got virtually
no function left to restore.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.254
- But still,
we should get EJ's input

20:12.298 --> 20:14.256
and see if this is what
either of them would want.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.823
- Kid's 15 years old.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.999
So, you're welcome to inform
him as to what we're doing,

20:18.042 --> 20:22.003
but we're not conducting
a straw poll here, Dr. Hammer.

20:22.046 --> 20:24.048
The decision's been made.

20:24.092 --> 20:28.575
<i>[somber music]</i>

20:32.492 --> 20:34.711
- All set for you, Dr. Marcel.
- Okay.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.286
I can't get it
to lay posteriorly.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.332
Maybe I can push the stomach
to the left more.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.855
- Liver's still too large.

20:47.898 --> 20:50.336
- Well, I--I've got more room
to resect more tissue.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.033
- Not much,
from the looks of it.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.643
- I can make it work.

20:53.687 --> 20:54.905
- Let's hope so.

21:01.434 --> 21:06.439
- Dr. Taylor, did I hear that
you gave Astrid a spinal tap?

21:06.482 --> 21:08.745
- I just wanted to make sure
we weren't looking at MS.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.704
- I thought that we covered
that earlier.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.314
- Oh,
and all the labs are back.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.403
They're negative
across the board.

21:14.447 --> 21:17.580
- Okay, so it's official.
No MS?

21:17.624 --> 21:20.844
- It still doesn't rule out
something neurological.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.411
Maggie, I want to order
another MRI,

21:22.455 --> 21:23.673
but this time with contrast.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.545
- Okay, wait.
Look, Vanessa.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.677
This young lady, she's been
through a traumatic event.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.592
Right?
She's in a vulnerable place.

21:29.636 --> 21:32.421
And now we've spent the last
couple of hours sliding her

21:32.465 --> 21:34.031
in and out of metal tubes,

21:34.075 --> 21:35.685
sticking big needles
in her back.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.818
- Her parents are talking
about having her committed.

21:37.861 --> 21:40.342
I just want to make sure
that this diagnosis is correct.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.691
- And I applaud your drive

21:41.735 --> 21:43.302
in trying to figure out
what's going on here.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.913
But I also would encourage you
to think of her as,

21:45.956 --> 21:47.784
I don't know,
more as a human being

21:47.828 --> 21:51.353
and less maybe as a test
you're gonna get graded on.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.659
I mean, I think
it's--it's just important

21:52.702 --> 21:55.052
to strike a balance there.
Okay?

21:55.096 --> 21:58.708
- Yeah.
- Great. Thank you.

21:58.752 --> 22:02.016
Mags, page me once
she becomes lucid. Thank you.

22:04.627 --> 22:08.022
- You mean,
he's going to be paralyzed?

22:08.065 --> 22:10.764
Like totally paralyzed?

22:10.807 --> 22:13.984
- Look, EJ,
I know this is difficult.

22:14.028 --> 22:17.379
But the important thing
is that cognitively,

22:17.423 --> 22:19.338
your father should make
a full recovery.

22:19.381 --> 22:23.777
- He won't be able to--to walk,
or--or ride his bike,

22:23.820 --> 22:26.867
or even eat on his own.

22:26.910 --> 22:29.826
He wouldn't want
to live like that.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.527
There's got to be another way.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.530
- Actually,
there is another option.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.621
If we fuse your father's spine

22:41.664 --> 22:43.927
and then decompress
the spinal cord

22:43.971 --> 22:46.930
with a procedure
called a laminectomy,

22:46.974 --> 22:48.845
there's a chance
that he could regain some

22:48.889 --> 22:50.804
or all of his motor function.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.980
- But it is
extremely high risk

22:53.023 --> 22:55.461
with very little chance
of success.

22:55.504 --> 22:56.853
It doubles the length
of the surgery,

22:56.897 --> 22:58.420
and there's a very good chance

22:58.464 --> 23:00.161
that it could make
his injury worse.

23:00.204 --> 23:04.165
Or kill him.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.689
- I know my dad.

23:06.733 --> 23:09.431
That's a risk
he'd be willing to take.

23:11.694 --> 23:14.175
- I'll speak with Dr. Abrams.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.525
- Dr. Hammer,
can I speak with you outside?

23:20.094 --> 23:21.443
What are you doing?

23:21.487 --> 23:22.879
- EJ has a right
to know his options.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.185
- You made him think
he has a choice.

23:24.228 --> 23:26.622
- It's his father.
His life, his future.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.972
- The future you're promising
him, you can't deliver.

23:29.016 --> 23:31.105
- But EJ said this is
what his father would want.

23:31.148 --> 23:34.848
- Yeah, he's 15
and recovering from a trauma.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.458
He's just a kid.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.721
- Yeah, and I'm gonna
do everything in my power

23:38.765 --> 23:40.462
to help him stay that way.

23:43.683 --> 23:46.686
- Damn it.
It still doesn't fit. Suction.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.209
I mean,
I can't remove any more tissue

23:48.252 --> 23:51.691
and keep the liver viable.
- How's our patient, Marty?

23:51.734 --> 23:54.476
- Temp is down
and he's coagulopathic.

23:54.520 --> 23:58.175
- Well, if we can't make
our square peg any smaller,

23:58.219 --> 24:00.526
maybe we can make
the round hole larger.

24:00.569 --> 24:01.701
- What are you suggesting?

24:01.744 --> 24:03.093
That we expand
the abdominal cavity?

24:03.137 --> 24:06.053
- There's not enough
posterior space, right?

24:06.096 --> 24:09.012
So, can we make
the diaphragm larger?

24:09.056 --> 24:13.060
- Oh I see, that'll create
some space for us to maneuver

24:13.103 --> 24:15.018
the liver into position, yeah.

24:15.062 --> 24:19.066
- Okay.
Get Dr. Marcel a scalpel.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.720
- Okay.
- Let's go.

24:28.075 --> 24:31.774
- Sharon, hey.
Sorry for the intrusion.

24:31.818 --> 24:34.560
You remember Roger Flanagan,
from the Board?

24:34.603 --> 24:36.039
- Yes.

24:36.083 --> 24:41.131
I just saw your son-in-law,
Dr. Cooper, at the M&M.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.220
- Sad business.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.658
- To what do I owe
this pleasure?

24:45.701 --> 24:47.529
- First of all,
I want to salute you

24:47.573 --> 24:50.619
on the stand you took
with the department heads.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.491
What happened with that patient
is a tragedy,

24:52.534 --> 24:54.928
and we need to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.712
- I appreciate that.

24:56.756 --> 24:59.106
- That said,
we want to make sure

24:59.149 --> 25:01.238
we're in the clear legally.

25:01.282 --> 25:02.544
Peter, you identified a couple

25:02.588 --> 25:04.111
of potential soft spots,
didn't you?

25:04.154 --> 25:06.766
- You know, Vasik could say
we're in breach of contract.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.855
Or worse,
pursue a defamation claim.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.639
And that gets in front
of the wrong judge,

25:10.683 --> 25:12.946
we could be looking
at a pretty hefty payout.

25:12.989 --> 25:15.601
- That's why the Board's
decided to hold off

25:15.644 --> 25:18.038
on banning the Vas-COM
just yet.

25:18.081 --> 25:21.911
Instead, we'd like to form
a committee to investigate

25:21.955 --> 25:23.217
any claims of malfunction.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.653
And when we get
all the data in,

25:24.697 --> 25:26.568
we can make a studied decision.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.744
- I see.

25:30.137 --> 25:32.226
- Always good to see you,
Sharon.

25:32.269 --> 25:34.010
- Indeed.

- Well, well.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.039
Why is that?

26:03.083 --> 26:05.651

aren't as corruptible.

26:05.694 --> 26:08.262
Look, companies like Vasik,
they want to make sure

26:08.305 --> 26:09.655

it goes down smooth.

been morally compromised,

26:24.757 --> 26:26.323
promoting the Vas-COM?

26:49.172 --> 26:51.131
No wonder Vasik's trying
to get their hooks in you.

- Come on, man.
No one goes down that fast.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.027
- Listen, Ethan, we both know

27:18.071 --> 27:19.942
how quickly a situation
like this can go south.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.683
This is why you need
to be prepared

27:21.727 --> 27:22.989
if you're going to return
to the ED.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.484
- Why exactly are
we doing this?

27:40.528 --> 27:43.096
- An EEG can determine
Astrid's brain activity

27:43.139 --> 27:44.967
that might be useful
in--in realizing

27:45.011 --> 27:47.883
diagnoses such as epilepsy
or a tumor.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.232
- I thought we determined
she was suffering

27:49.276 --> 27:50.973
from some kind
of psychiatric disorder?

27:51.017 --> 27:52.888
- Just want to make sure
there's no underlying causes.

27:52.932 --> 27:54.803
- Dr. Taylor?
Can I get a moment?

27:59.982 --> 28:01.331
I thought we decided
to put a pause

28:01.375 --> 28:02.724
on the battery of tests.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.987
- I know, but I needed to--
to rule out epilepsy

28:05.031 --> 28:06.162
as an underlying cause.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.337
- You know, I gotta be honest
with you,

28:07.381 --> 28:08.774
I'm a little concerned.

28:08.817 --> 28:09.992
I think you're pushing
way too hard here.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.515
- No.
- Yeah.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.821
And I think that maybe
you should take a little break.

28:12.865 --> 28:13.996
I think you should go home...

28:14.040 --> 28:15.781
- Go home?
- And get some rest. Yeah.

28:15.824 --> 28:17.173

- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:18.914 --> 28:21.787
I didn't say that.
Why would I think that?

28:21.830 --> 28:24.006
- Maggie told me you that know
about me and her,

28:24.050 --> 28:26.139

28:36.323 --> 28:37.759
- Is she having a seizure?

- The EEG says
that's not what's happening.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.197
- Then what is happening?
- Push 10 of labetalol.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.416
And get her on oxygen.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.160
- Why is this happening?
- You know, I don't know.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.945
It's usually caused
by traumatic brain injury.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.826

Okay. Let's get another MRI,

29:27.461 --> 29:29.202
- Not out of the woods yet.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.899
Still need to attach
the vessels.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.814
Let's get started
with the hepatic vein.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.294
- Okay.

29:35.599 --> 29:39.081
- [sniffs] You wanna hit
some of this, buddy?

29:39.125 --> 29:41.431
- Nah, I'm okay.
- Good for you, Will.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.911
That's good. That's good.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.913
You--you--you keep
making the good choices.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.829
You leave the bad choices
to moi.

29:49.962 --> 29:54.357
[snorts]

29:54.401 --> 29:58.971
- Matt, do you think putting
another Vas-COM on Eleanor

29:59.014 --> 30:01.625
was a bad choice?

30:01.669 --> 30:03.279
- What do you think?

30:03.323 --> 30:05.455
- We knew there might
be contraindications.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.983
Why'd you do it?

30:11.026 --> 30:12.506
- You still haven't figured
that out yet?

30:12.549 --> 30:15.944
God. That's weird.
- You all right?

30:15.988 --> 30:19.252
- Yeah.
My arm's--my arm's tight.

30:19.295 --> 30:22.342
- Let me check.
- I'm good, I'm good.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.042
I don't feel so good.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.914
- Let's get you some fresh air.
- Yeah.

30:28.957 --> 30:30.089
- No, no, no,
let's get you out--

30:30.132 --> 30:32.091
let's get you out of here.
- Okay.

30:32.134 --> 30:34.310
- Just take it easy.
Deep breaths.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.486
- There you go, you got it.
- I'm good. I'm good.

30:36.530 --> 30:39.011
- All right. Yeah, you're good.

30:39.054 --> 30:41.317
Let's sit you down,
get you a glass of water.

30:41.361 --> 30:44.494
You'll be good as new.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.975
Oh, damn it.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.629
Come on. Talk to me.

30:51.632 --> 30:54.983
- Oh, my God, what's happening?
- Call 911.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.032
- Come on.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.170
- Stevie, what's going on?

31:08.214 --> 31:09.911
- I'm doing a second ASIA exam.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.957
- Abrams already made the call.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.481
- That was before
Nathan's spine was in traction.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.135
- And you think
the stabilized alignment

31:16.178 --> 31:18.006
will improve Nathan's score?

31:18.050 --> 31:20.269
- It's the only way to change
Abrams' mind,

31:20.313 --> 31:22.402
get him to go for
the decompressive laminectomy.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.756
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

31:28.799 --> 31:30.540
Reflexive muscle contraction.
Way beneath the zone of injury.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.194
- He's still got
motor function.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.501
He might not be
completely paralyzed.

31:34.544 --> 31:36.242
Dr. Abrams,
I need to show you something.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.119
- Am I missing something?

31:44.163 --> 31:47.340
- His pelvis just flinched
a second ago.

31:47.383 --> 31:48.950
- It was a subtle finding.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.213
- Glad to see you two sat
for your neurosurgery boards

31:51.257 --> 31:54.129
while I was away.
- I know what I saw.

31:54.173 --> 31:57.045
I think that Mr. Daniels has
a Grade B incomplete injury.

31:57.089 --> 31:58.220
- He has motor function
to salvage

31:58.264 --> 31:59.700
if we decompress the cord.

31:59.743 --> 32:02.268
- He could get his legs back.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.401
- Well, that would
change the calculus.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.969
But you better be certain
you saw what you saw.

32:08.013 --> 32:11.233
Because if you're not,
and this man dies on my table,

32:11.277 --> 32:13.627
you'll be the ones
to explain why to his son.

32:18.719 --> 32:19.720
- We're sure.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.726
- Okay.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.249
Let's do it.

32:34.213 --> 32:36.128
- Talk to me.
- Cocaine-induced MI.

32:36.171 --> 32:37.477
Shocked three times
in the field.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.608
Intermittent ROSC.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.175
- Ethan, need an extra
set of hands.

32:40.219 --> 32:41.655
- That Matt Cooper?
- Yeah.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.659
All right, on my count.

32:45.702 --> 32:48.053
One, two, three.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.490
Get him up on the monitors.
Milligram of epi.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.448
- You got a pulse?
- Still in V-fib.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.189
Let's run the code.
Doris, compressions.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.104
- You got it.
- Where's the defibrillator?

32:56.148 --> 32:58.802
- T4.

32:58.846 --> 33:01.501
- Ethan, intubate
while I grab the paddles.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.901
- Hold compressions.
- Clear.

33:12.512 --> 33:15.819
- Sats are dropping 78.
- Hang on.

33:15.863 --> 33:18.387
- Sats down to 74.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.999
Dr. Choi?
- Doris...

33:21.042 --> 33:23.218
I'm in.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.046
- How we looking?

33:25.090 --> 33:26.787
- Sats are coming back up.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.528
- Still in V-fib.
- Another milligram of epi.

33:28.571 --> 33:31.052
Charge to 200.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.533
Okay, clear.
- Clear.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.665
[machines beeping]

33:35.709 --> 33:37.015
- Got a pulse.

33:37.058 --> 33:40.670
- Sinus tach.
Just like riding a bike, right?

33:42.411 --> 33:45.501
12-lead EKG, chest x-ray,
and page cardiology.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.549
- So, Astrid the good news
is that your hallucinations

33:49.592 --> 33:50.724
are not being caused

33:50.767 --> 33:52.726
by any kind of
underlying mental illness.

33:52.769 --> 33:55.033
- So I'm not going crazy?

33:55.076 --> 33:57.426
- Well, no.

33:57.470 --> 34:00.473
But a genetic panel
has revealed that you have

34:00.516 --> 34:03.563
a disorder called
metachromatic leukodystrophy

34:03.606 --> 34:05.565
or MLD.

34:07.088 --> 34:09.003
- MLD causes the brain
and nervous system

34:09.047 --> 34:10.918
to progressively
lose its function.

34:10.961 --> 34:13.790
The first symptoms
are often psychotic episodes,

34:13.834 --> 34:15.357
followed by a host of others

34:15.401 --> 34:17.316
such as poor muscle function
like we witnessed.

34:17.359 --> 34:18.839
- So this is going
to get worse?

34:18.882 --> 34:21.407
- Hopefully we can mitigate
its progression with meds.

34:21.450 --> 34:22.930
- And the fact that you haven't
shown any symptoms

34:22.973 --> 34:25.715
until recently is a really,
really good sign.

34:25.759 --> 34:27.413
It means we caught it early

34:27.456 --> 34:30.764
and should point to a better
outcome going forward.

34:30.807 --> 34:33.854
- At least I know
what's going on with me.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.551
Such a huge relief.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.077
Thank you.

34:41.557 --> 34:42.863
- Thank you.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.698
- Dr. Blake?

34:51.741 --> 34:55.441
- Oh.
Fundraiser for the program.

34:55.484 --> 34:58.444
12 hours in the OR, and they
still expect me to wear heels.

34:58.487 --> 35:01.403
- Right. Ha.
- What do you need?

35:01.447 --> 35:03.101
- Look, I just wanted to say
that I realize

35:03.144 --> 35:04.972
I might have painted you
into a corner,

35:05.015 --> 35:08.584
you know, you and the team,
pushing for that surgery.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.978
And I--I wanted to apologize.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.415
- Why?

35:13.459 --> 35:14.982
I've been waiting two weeks
for the Crockett

35:15.025 --> 35:18.986
who threw me off my daughter's
case to show up in my OR.

35:19.029 --> 35:20.509
Nice he could finally make it.

35:27.429 --> 35:30.693
Self-doubt's not
a good look on you.

35:30.737 --> 35:33.392
Have a good night, Dr. Marcel.

35:35.872 --> 35:38.614
- Nathan, this is Dr. Abrams.

35:38.658 --> 35:41.139
Can you move
your left foot for me?

35:43.228 --> 35:45.665
Can you wiggle your toes?

35:45.708 --> 35:49.059
Nathan, can you wiggle
your toes for me?

35:59.853 --> 36:02.856
- Come on, Dad. Please.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.610
Thank you. Thank you.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.918
- Happy we could help.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.922
Excuse me.

36:35.105 --> 36:37.107
- Hell of a call today.

36:40.459 --> 36:42.678
Hey, what's wrong?

36:45.203 --> 36:46.943
- I'm just so relieved.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.207
I wasn't sure I was making
the right call.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.121
- But you did.

36:51.165 --> 36:52.514
It all worked out.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.734
You fought for a 15-year-old,
and you won.

36:54.777 --> 36:57.127
- I don't know.

36:57.171 --> 36:58.781
I feel like maybe

36:58.825 --> 37:01.175
the 15-year-old I was fighting
for today was me.

37:01.219 --> 37:05.005
I was EJ's age when I had
to start taking care of my mom.

37:05.048 --> 37:08.051
It took so much out of me.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.923
It still does.

37:09.966 --> 37:13.796
- Want to talk about it?
Grab a beer?

37:13.840 --> 37:16.582
- I wish. I can't tonight.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.454
I got to get home to my mom.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.719
- It's all good.
- Yeah. See you tomorrow.

37:23.763 --> 37:25.199
- I'll see you tomorrow.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.942
- Thank you for today.
- Yeah.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.598
- Dr. Charles?
You have a minute?

37:32.641 --> 37:35.165
- Yeah. Come on in.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.950
- I just wanted to
come up and apologize.

37:36.993 --> 37:38.517
- What for?

37:38.560 --> 37:39.779
- I accused you of thinking
that I didn't belong here

37:39.822 --> 37:41.694
and that wasn't right.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.523
I'm realize that I was
projecting my own insecurities

37:44.566 --> 37:46.829
onto you.
- No apology necessary.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.266
Matter of fact,
I'm glad you stopped by

37:48.309 --> 37:50.268
because I wanted to commend you

37:50.311 --> 37:52.531
on your stick-to-itiveness
today, really.

37:52.574 --> 37:55.273
- Thank you. Thank you.
That means a lot.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.884
- But you know
what really sucks?

37:57.927 --> 38:00.626
What really sucks is when
capable people like yourself

38:00.669 --> 38:02.497
feel like they need,

38:02.541 --> 38:05.152
I don't know, a little, um...

38:05.195 --> 38:08.590
a little extra help to keep up.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.157
- What do you mean?

38:10.200 --> 38:13.116
- What I mean is, I don't know,
like what, caffeine pills

38:13.160 --> 38:16.772
or too many energy drinks,
or I mean, God forbid,

38:16.816 --> 38:18.296
straight up pharmaceuticals,
you know?

38:18.339 --> 38:20.298
- If you're talking about
the pill I took this morning,

38:20.341 --> 38:22.517
I--I told you
that it was for my allergies.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.171
I'm not on anything.

38:24.214 --> 38:25.738
- Look, Vanessa, all I'm saying
is that I really understand

38:25.781 --> 38:27.000
the kind of pressure
you're under--

38:27.043 --> 38:28.610
- I should get back
to the floor.

38:28.654 --> 38:30.873
But thank you so much,
Dr. Charles. I appreciate it.

38:36.662 --> 38:37.837
- Hey.

38:37.880 --> 38:41.971
I heard what happened.
How's he doing?

38:42.015 --> 38:46.933
- Seems he dodged a bullet.
But it's too soon to tell.

38:46.976 --> 38:50.153
I was so close
to getting him to confess.

38:50.197 --> 38:55.202
- Well, an experience like this
has been known to change a man.

38:55.245 --> 38:58.553
Guess we'll have to wait to see
what effect it has on him.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.961
- You cleaned.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.006
- The landlord was
on my ass about it.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.099
- Looks good.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.628
Hey, Mom,

39:29.671 --> 39:31.978
you know I always do my best
to take care of you.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.893
- I know, hon.

39:33.936 --> 39:37.026
That avocado toast this morning
was actually pretty good.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.898
- Ha ha. Good.

39:42.162 --> 39:50.866
Well, I more meant...
if I push you or overstep,

39:50.910 --> 39:53.129
it's only 'cause I love you.

39:54.304 --> 39:57.656
- What's this about?

39:59.962 --> 40:04.271
- You were so adamant about
not staying in the hospital.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.273
And I was afraid that you
wouldn't take care of yourself

40:06.316 --> 40:10.408
after you left, so...

40:10.451 --> 40:12.671
I had your van towed.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.414
- What?

40:16.457 --> 40:17.763
- I thought that if you just
stayed with me for a few weeks,

40:17.806 --> 40:18.938
that I could take care of you

40:18.981 --> 40:20.940
while you took
your antibiotics.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.638
- My home.
You took my home from me.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.205
- I know I was wrong.
I am sorry.

40:25.248 --> 40:27.250
I did it to protect you.
I didn't know what else to--

40:27.294 --> 40:31.472
- My whole life. How could you?

40:31.516 --> 40:32.952
- Stop, stop! Mom, please.

40:32.995 --> 40:34.388
Please, let's just talk
about this.

40:34.432 --> 40:38.000
- You lied to me!
- Come on. No, Mom, please.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.175
Stop it, Mom.

40:39.219 --> 40:40.655
God--

40:47.357 --> 40:51.361
- I'm--I'm sorry.
- No. I'm okay. I'm okay.

40:51.405 --> 40:54.408
Mom, I'm okay.
What are you doing?

40:56.149 --> 40:58.978
Mom, what are you doing?

40:59.021 --> 41:00.458
- I gotta go.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.808
- No, no.
Come on, Mom, please, Mom.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.331
Mom, stop. Mom!

41:04.374 --> 41:06.115
[door slams]
