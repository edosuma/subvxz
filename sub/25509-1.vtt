my word against his?

49:20.515 --> 49:21.448
He is Commissioner.

49:21.450 --> 49:23.683
And a married man to boot.

49:23.685 --> 49:25.488
He's established
his faithfulness.

49:28.324 --> 49:31.258
Commissioner or no, he
has thus far proven impotent

49:31.260 --> 49:33.827
in his lame attempts to
solve the despicable crime

49:33.829 --> 49:36.130
of the murder of my husband.

49:36.132 --> 49:37.932
It's an ongoing investigation.

49:39.336 --> 49:42.669

that every word I speak

my predicament

50:36.994 --> 50:39.229
and the subsequent conclusion
to which it has led me.

50:39.231 --> 50:41.965
It is smart indeed to
ask for understanding

50:41.967 --> 50:43.402
when he who asks has nil.

to you, Inspector Shoerope.

50:59.885 --> 51:02.955
And you are alone in your
awareness of it being so,

51:03.957 --> 51:05.258

a woman to lament

51:16.869 --> 51:18.171

51:25.512 --> 51:27.448
the betrayal of her beauty,

age and ultimately,

I imagined he never thought

01:15:27.716 --> 01:15:29.282
it would lead to his
