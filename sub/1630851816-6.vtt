WEBVTT

00:44.461 --> 00:47.380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:47.464 --> 00:49.132
There we go.

00:50.508 --> 00:54.888
All right, Jae-young! That's nice.

00:57.348 --> 00:58.808
Very nice.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.187
So cold.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.565
Oh, it's cold.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.026
Oh, it's cold.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.495
-Should I light up the wood?
-Yes.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.562
-Jung-hyun.
-Yes?

01:44.646 --> 01:46.689
There's something I have to tell you.

01:46.773 --> 01:47.732
What is it?

01:48.900 --> 01:52.028
But if you'd rather not hear it,
then that's up to you.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.573
What is it?

01:56.282 --> 01:58.159
You decide. Would you like to hear it?

03:48.144 --> 03:50.772
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

05:03.761 --> 05:05.096
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

06:07.283 --> 06:09.368
-Let's check it out. Come on.
-What's going on?

06:15.625 --> 06:18.044
-What happened to you?
-Go check that area.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.315
Yes, sir.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.567
I've seen the car.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.028
I think it's him.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.790
Who's there?

06:57.333 --> 06:58.501
Is it you, Jung-hyun?

07:08.803 --> 07:10.346
Oh gosh, Jung-hyun.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.099
Oh my goodness.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.852
Jung-hyun. Wake up.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.438
-My goodness.
-Mom.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.024
I'm here. Mom is here.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.819
Oh my gosh. I'm right here.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.575
I'm okay. Don't cry.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.918
When you went back there,
they'd cleaned up everything, you say?

07:41.544 --> 07:42.962
And all the doors were locked?

07:43.045 --> 07:47.216
It looked like an empty building
when I got there.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.969
So I don't think it's their headquarters.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.555
What were they doing then?

07:52.638 --> 07:53.764
Isn't it obvious?

07:53.848 --> 07:55.391
They were engaged in
some kind of religious rite.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.270
They seem to be moving
from place to place to do their rites.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.856
You mean a pilgrimage?

08:01.939 --> 08:05.318
The basement of the Skull Gang's compound
was also used for such rites.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.696
-I saw that symbol and…
-What else?

08:08.779 --> 08:10.031
that creepy bell ring.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.492
I clearly heard it back then.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.161
The fact that the Skull Gang
was sharing the same compound

08:15.244 --> 08:18.289
with the Youngjin sect
means they are directly connected.

08:18.956 --> 08:22.293
But all of the Skull Gang members
were caught and sentenced.

08:23.753 --> 08:28.341
I know a guy who was a supplier
for gangs in Busan long ago.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.760
He used to deliver gas tanks,
but he's not working for them anymore.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.428
I'll go and meet with him first.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.763
Who are you talking about?

08:34.472 --> 08:35.765
Are you talking about him?

08:36.682 --> 08:38.809
The guy who is a loan shark?

08:38.893 --> 08:41.604
Wait. What was his name?

08:41.687 --> 08:45.525
It was one of those names.
Cow or something.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.651
Pig.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.070
He was called Pig.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.201
Pig.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.702
Yes, Boss.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.412
What were you like in school?

08:58.996 --> 09:00.122
School?

09:00.206 --> 09:03.709
I dropped out of middle school,
so I don't remember much about school.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.004
It's the same with you?

09:07.838 --> 09:09.465
I don't remember much either.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.092
You were on the school's judo team, right?

09:11.175 --> 09:14.387
You probably only remember
doing judo back then.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.721
Well…

09:16.389 --> 09:17.682
It's really weird.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.477
I don't remember much after 1987.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.396
I don't remember my graduation day

09:23.479 --> 09:25.773
nor why
the school magazine club disbanded.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.150
I don't recall a thing.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.444
You don't?

09:35.324 --> 09:39.120
SAJU GENERAL HOSPITAL

09:45.042 --> 09:46.377
We're here.

09:46.961 --> 09:47.795
Boss.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.881
I'll take a taxi to go back to the office.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.008
You don't have to.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.552
It won't take long. Just wait for me.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.013
I'm expecting a customer. So I have to go.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.932
Really? Then why did you come along?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.934
I thought I'd be your driver.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.687
Why? Did you think I would bail?

10:04.770 --> 10:08.065
Oh, gosh. No. I wouldn't interfere
in your business, Boss.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.861
The last time you met her,

10:11.944 --> 10:15.114
you didn't have any energy
for days afterward.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.074
I noticed that.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.745
So I thought about it.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.623
I suppose you dated her
in high school or something--

10:23.706 --> 10:25.499
That mouth of yours…

10:25.583 --> 10:26.626
I'm sorry, Boss.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.962
Hurry back to the office
and earn your keep, will you?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.214
Okay.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.898
Oh, don't be a slowpoke.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.274
You better run. You fat pig.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.902
I can still see your feet. Run faster.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.216
What? What is it?

11:21.680 --> 11:23.474
You were gazing out the window so hard

11:23.557 --> 11:25.309
I thought there was
something scary outside.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.436
Thanks for coming.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.688
This is the secret
behind the success of my business.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.943
I handle the urgent stuff first
with a Band-aid solution.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.364
So you should handle
the urgent stuff first.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.784
We can talk about the old times later.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.871
Thanks, Yong-tak.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.463
Hello.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.090
Oh, hi.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.634
Who are you?

12:00.094 --> 12:03.013
I'm Jung-hyun's high school friend.
Nice to meet you.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.141
Oh, you're a friend.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.392
Thank you for coming.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.103
You came during the daytime.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.606
I'm a business owner
so I set my own hours.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.483
Oh, you are?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.194
-That's good.
-Oh, sure.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.655
Yong-tak, how about we go outside?

12:20.489 --> 12:23.325
Mom, can I go outside for a short while?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.161
You'd like that?

12:26.078 --> 12:29.248
All right. I'll organize your stuff
in the meantime.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.292
Let's go.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.597
Where are you going?

12:46.474 --> 12:47.850
Isn't it this way?

12:48.350 --> 12:51.020
Yong-tak, did you bring
the thing I asked you to get?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.899
Oh, I forgot. It's in my car.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.818
I'm sorry, but I need a favor.
Can you go somewhere with me?

12:58.861 --> 12:59.945
Well…

13:00.905 --> 13:02.406
It's not a problem.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.326
You're still recovering though.
Will you be okay?

13:05.409 --> 13:06.660
I'm fine.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.454
My mom made me come to the hospital.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.998
I'm not comfortable about this.

13:12.708 --> 13:16.754
I need a favor.
I'll explain everything on our way.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.053
Let's go.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.361
<i>THE DREAM OF GYEONGCHEON</i>

13:42.363 --> 13:44.073
Why did you ask me to bring you that?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.079
Yong-tak.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.123
Actually,

13:54.625 --> 13:56.252
I met Young-seob.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.003
What?

13:59.755 --> 14:00.798
Jung Young-seob?

14:01.632 --> 14:02.466
Yes.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.468
He died, didn't he?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.136
It was all fake.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.264
The people at his funeral
were all fake too.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.265
They were?

14:10.182 --> 14:12.476
Doesn't he have a life?
Why did he fake his death?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.852
I felt that

14:15.396 --> 14:16.522
Young-seob was

14:17.773 --> 14:20.359
completely consumed in his own world.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.696
He had cut off
all contact with the outside world.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.322
All right.

14:25.990 --> 14:29.285
So is he involved in the things
happening around you?

14:34.373 --> 14:35.833
So the thing is…

14:36.542 --> 14:38.043
I have something to tell you.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.507
But it's difficult to bring it up
now that I decided to tell you.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.304
Take your time. You don't need to hurry.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.223
Well,

14:51.932 --> 14:53.809
I promised myself one thing.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.311
I'm not going to hide anything

14:55.936 --> 14:57.062
from my friends anymore.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.567
That's my first priority.
Everything else comes in second.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.488
Yong-tak.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.575
Do you remember…

15:11.911 --> 15:14.705
the Saju station gas attack
that happened in 1987?

15:15.789 --> 15:16.749
Yes.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.545
They say…

15:25.174 --> 15:27.718
I got you to help carry that out.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.222
Carry what out?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.642
What did we do?

15:36.518 --> 15:37.603
We helped that bastard

15:38.854 --> 15:40.648
bringing the bags containing nerve gas

15:41.941 --> 15:45.444
to the train station to help that devil.

15:46.862 --> 15:47.905
What?

15:48.572 --> 15:49.990
I'm the one

15:52.409 --> 15:53.869
who made you do it.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.540
If that's true,

15:59.124 --> 16:01.001
then Jae-young's abduction

16:02.920 --> 16:04.463
also involves me in some way.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.093
Even if…

16:11.512 --> 16:13.973
it's something I did
that I can't remember.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.596
Keep the change.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.709
You can't solve it, right?

17:24.543 --> 17:27.171
I haven't solved it once after buying it.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.339
Really?

17:29.423 --> 17:32.301
What brings you here?
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.469
Well,

17:34.428 --> 17:35.846
life is full of surprises.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.139
Would you like some tea?

17:37.222 --> 17:38.182
No thanks. Sit down.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.400
How is Detective Lee?

17:48.484 --> 17:50.944
I met him on the road once.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.237
Shi-jung is dead.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.866
What? Oh, come on.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.868
How can you joke around like that?

17:57.951 --> 17:58.994
I'm not.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.205
He really died.

18:02.664 --> 18:03.874
His wife killed him.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.175
Pig.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.011
When you were delivering
gas tanks to the Skull Gang--

18:16.095 --> 18:18.889
Oh, please, Detective Choi.
Why are you bringing that up?

18:18.972 --> 18:21.767
I quit doing deliveries
for them years ago.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.561
-Pig.
-Yes, Detective Choi.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.021
Stop interrupting me.

18:26.980 --> 18:27.815
Okay.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.859
There's a smuggler, Professor Jang,
the go-between for the Skull Gang

18:30.943 --> 18:33.570
-and the Japanese gang, right?
-Yes, I know him.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.573
Later on, I was handling
all of the smuggling.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.159
Have you ever seen Professor Jang?

18:39.243 --> 18:40.327
No.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.080
Why do you want to know?

18:44.540 --> 18:47.209
Well, the entire Skull Gang was arrested

18:47.292 --> 18:48.585
except for him.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.003
Of course.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.798
Hardly anyone has ever seen his face.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.716
He sets up the deal

18:54.800 --> 18:56.343
and he never shows up himself.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.846
All he does is research, you know.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.975
Well, you know…

19:04.059 --> 19:05.310
I need you to find him for me.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.857
You know a few retired
Skull Gang members, don't you?

19:09.940 --> 19:11.817
They're also receiving a pension.

19:11.900 --> 19:12.901
I do?

19:16.572 --> 19:18.657
These files will help you get up to speed.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.878
HONGAN-DONG MOTHER-DAUGHTER
MURDER CASE

19:32.796 --> 19:33.839
AUTOPSY REPORT

19:33.922 --> 19:36.300
ANNEX: AUTOPSY RESULT PART 1

19:40.721 --> 19:42.264
Look here, Detective Choi.

19:42.347 --> 19:46.268
When I helped you infiltrate the gang,
you made a promise to me.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.897
If I were to quit delivering gas tanks,
you'd never find me again.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.442
Gosh. This isn't right.
You're going back on your promise.

19:55.611 --> 19:59.114
What I'm saying is I need to know
what the heck is going on first.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.991
-Sorry.
-What?

20:05.704 --> 20:07.915
You're the only person
I can ask for this favor.

20:18.926 --> 20:19.843
A favor?

20:20.469 --> 20:21.970
What the?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.641
He's changed a lot.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.733
<i>-Geez.</i>
-Seriously?

20:34.816 --> 20:36.944
Look at those pigs. They look surprised.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.241
But why are there pigs here?

20:47.162 --> 20:48.747
It's freaking hot.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.377
Wasn't this place a deer farm?

20:56.755 --> 20:57.839
I thought so too.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.842
I don't see the symbol
or any writings here.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.224
You're saying that
in one of those seven spots,

21:08.225 --> 21:10.185
there could be a clue that might lead you

21:10.269 --> 21:12.354
to those crazy guys
who kidnapped your niece, right?

21:15.482 --> 21:16.775
I'm not 100 percent sure.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.236
I just think
there could be some connection.

21:19.319 --> 21:22.030
We've got a lot of time.
Let's look around…

21:29.371 --> 21:32.624
So you still practice judo?

21:33.542 --> 21:35.711
Your clothes are really big.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.685
Why aren't you talking? Do I look weird?

21:53.395 --> 21:54.688
Doesn't it smell?

21:54.771 --> 21:56.398
I didn't wash it once.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.066
What smell?

21:59.651 --> 22:00.652
It's all right.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.197
Well, the pigs are giving off
an overpowering smell.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.908
Oh, these pigs stink.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.577
It's crazy how bad they smell.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.164
Hey! Who are you?

22:12.247 --> 22:13.749
Hello. We're…

22:13.832 --> 22:15.542
Come out first. Let's talk outside.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.461
-What?
-I said come out.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.880
My pigs are very sensitive
to foreign odors.

22:19.963 --> 22:23.133
They get really stressed
when they smell a stranger.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.885
So come out now.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.971
Hurry up!

22:29.306 --> 22:31.308
I'm sorry, Pigs.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.601
We're sorry.

22:34.352 --> 22:35.771
We're sorry.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.190
YONGMA FAST CASH

22:38.815 --> 22:40.817
What kind of company is this?

22:40.901 --> 22:43.028
I don't have a clue about what you do.

22:44.863 --> 22:48.200
We provide financing.

22:48.283 --> 22:49.409
It's that kind of stuff.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.287
Long-term loans, credit loans and…

22:53.205 --> 22:54.206
Well…

22:54.289 --> 22:55.457
Payday loans too.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.376
I also dabble in real estate
like I am doing today.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.296
Oh, I'm not interested in any of that.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.841
There are a lot of fruit farms
near the mountain.

23:04.925 --> 23:05.967
Why don't you go there?

23:06.051 --> 23:08.637
That's hilly terrain, you know.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.680
It takes money to dig
and create flat land.

23:10.764 --> 23:15.060
My wife and I are not interested
in making more money.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.229
Our kids have all grown up and married.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.856
Raising pigs is an easy life.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.276
Just have to clean up
the poop now and then.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.696
I appreciate the offer, but no thanks.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.573
I see.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.493
If that's your decision, well…

23:32.577 --> 23:34.204
I feel sorry for drinking
this expensive rice punch.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.832
Oh, don't be. Please enjoy it.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.042
But sir,

23:39.126 --> 23:41.837
wasn't this place a deer farm before?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.505
That's what I heard.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.258
Oh, you're right.
There used to be a deer farm here.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.928
The previous owner
raised deer and sold antlers.

23:53.056 --> 23:56.017
Have you ever visited the place
when it was a deer farm?

23:56.601 --> 23:59.479
What? What are you talking about?

24:00.355 --> 24:03.441
Well, I was wondering
if you've ever seen this.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.278
This one here.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.572
Have you seen this symbol?

24:08.655 --> 24:12.325
Have I seen this before?

24:12.409 --> 24:13.785
I don't remember.

24:13.869 --> 24:17.622
There used to be a deer farm here.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.875
But it closed ten years ago.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.501
I see.

24:22.085 --> 24:25.380
When I first came here,
the place was a total mess.

24:25.463 --> 24:27.841
I had to work so hard to clean it up.

24:27.924 --> 24:32.929
When I first surveyed the place,
there was a strong rotting stench.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.265
So we bulldozed it all.
Even the furniture.

24:35.348 --> 24:37.684
I had the building razed too.

24:38.393 --> 24:41.021
-A rotting stench?
-Oh gosh. Don't get me started.

24:41.104 --> 24:45.525
The previous landowner
was going to erect a building here.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.820
He didn't maintain the farm at all.
Then he went to prison.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.448
All the deer starved to death

24:51.531 --> 24:53.909
because he locked
all the doors with chains

24:53.992 --> 24:56.453
and because of that, nobody could come in.

24:56.536 --> 25:00.790
The stench from the dead deer
spread throughout the village.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.709
The farmer wasn't showing up.

25:02.792 --> 25:06.254
So the villagers reported the problem
to the county.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.591
So the city offered to cover
all of the cleaning costs.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.218
That's why my wife and I took it over.

25:11.301 --> 25:15.138
If the city didn't do that,
no one would have come here.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.351
Do you exercise a little?

25:19.851 --> 25:22.229
You have to exercise a lot.

25:22.812 --> 25:26.483
I jog 10km a day, you know.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.526
If you don't exercise,

25:28.610 --> 25:31.279
your mind also deteriorates
along with your body.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.322
But

25:33.240 --> 25:36.993
I'm very happy to see
you agree to do the interview every month.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.747
I'm truly happy to see that.

25:44.542 --> 25:45.418
Right.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.129
Not as many as we used to get,

25:48.713 --> 25:52.509
but we get a lot of requests
from the press,

25:53.260 --> 25:55.637
asking to interview you.

25:56.429 --> 25:59.891
Like I told you before,
my stance remains the same.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.977
I will not accept any media requests

26:02.060 --> 26:04.896
while I am the warden of this prison.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.525
You still agree with that, right?

26:09.317 --> 26:10.902
It doesn't really matter.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.863
You just need to stay quiet.

26:14.614 --> 26:19.160
I've been watching you
for many years now, Mr. Jo.

26:19.244 --> 26:23.164
And my decision is in your best interest.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.293
Minimize contact with outside visitors

26:26.376 --> 26:28.211
and focus on staying balanced.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.463
You understand that, right?

26:33.591 --> 26:35.510
Could you stop tapping the armrest?

26:35.593 --> 26:37.220
It's distracting.

26:40.515 --> 26:43.518
That's all I had to say to you today.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.272
Is there anything you'd like to say?

26:50.984 --> 26:51.943
All right, then.

26:52.527 --> 26:55.447
Continue to cultivate your body and mind

26:55.530 --> 26:57.657
-and avoid bad thoughts--
-Excuse me.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.785
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.205
Look over there.

27:06.541 --> 27:07.709
What's there?

27:12.005 --> 27:13.506
What is that?

27:13.590 --> 27:15.008
Where is that sound coming from?

27:17.844 --> 27:20.138
It was nice knowing you.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.641
What did you say?

27:30.148 --> 27:33.526
Anybody out there? Help!

28:02.472 --> 28:04.349
Oh gosh. Thank you, sir.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.768
-The rice punch was delicious.
-Oh, it was?

28:06.851 --> 28:08.937
Can I ask you something?

28:09.521 --> 28:12.774
The land here isn't of much value,
so why are you scouting this area?

28:12.857 --> 28:15.068
-What's your purpose?
-Well…

28:15.985 --> 28:18.321
I'm investing in nursing homes.
That's what I'm here for.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.656
Oh, is that so?

28:20.407 --> 28:22.117
You won't be able
to get a permit for that.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.159
I know about that.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.454
I'm just thinking about it.
So don't tell your neighbors yet.

28:26.538 --> 28:30.291
The previous owner was planning
to build one here before he went to jail.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.919
The previous owner?
What are you talking about?

28:33.002 --> 28:36.297
This farm could have
become a welfare center.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.340
A welfare center?

28:37.424 --> 28:39.342
I mentioned it to you earlier.

28:39.426 --> 28:42.220
The landowner was going to
erect a building here.

28:42.303 --> 28:45.306
But he couldn't get a permit,
so he left the farm neglected for years.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.351
If not, a welfare center
would be standing here.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.147
What kind of welfare center was it?

28:53.106 --> 28:57.569
There was a big scandal ten years ago.

28:58.778 --> 29:01.281
What was the name of that place again?

29:01.948 --> 29:04.868
It was called
the Family Welfare Center, I think.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.786
I'm not sure if that's right.

29:08.288 --> 29:12.584
The owner of the deer farm was also
the director of that welfare center.

29:12.667 --> 29:16.463
Are you talking about
the One Family Welfare Center?

29:17.172 --> 29:19.799
Yes, that's it.
The One Family Welfare Center.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.512
What? Do you know that place?

29:27.724 --> 29:29.017
That bastard and I…

29:30.769 --> 29:32.437
grew up there.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.608
The One Family Welfare Center.

29:44.073 --> 29:46.576
Okay. Did you clean it all up?

29:47.243 --> 29:51.164
Did you clean the blood
splattered on the table legs?

29:51.706 --> 29:53.666
Are you sure?

29:54.542 --> 29:57.128
Geez. What an unlucky day.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.423
Geez.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.440
Why is it so dark?

30:29.077 --> 30:33.039
<i>I'll be back after the gathering ends.
Heat the stew on the stove for dinner.</i>

30:42.382 --> 30:44.133
What is this?

31:01.693 --> 31:04.153
What is this sound? It sounds so eerie.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.874
What is wrong with this? Damn it.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.657
Oh gosh.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.743
The closet door opened again.

31:55.288 --> 31:56.956
Oh boy.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.043
One day, I'll have to fix it or something.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.472
Gosh. Why won't it close?
What a piece of garbage.

32:12.555 --> 32:14.265
Come on, seriously.

32:16.893 --> 32:19.354
Honey, are you sleeping?

32:19.437 --> 32:21.564
I brought apples for us to eat together.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.362
Are you in there?

32:28.071 --> 32:30.198
Why aren't you answering?

32:32.075 --> 32:33.326
What is that sound?

32:39.207 --> 32:40.750
What are you doing, Honey?

32:52.136 --> 32:54.222
You're not a kid. What is this?

32:56.474 --> 32:58.309
Stop playing around.

32:59.852 --> 33:02.772
You're frightening me now.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.032
Honey.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.868
Are you inside the closet? Is it you?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.290
Should I open it?

33:27.672 --> 33:29.716
Go away. Just go away.

33:29.799 --> 33:32.135
Dear, what is the meaning of this?

33:40.560 --> 33:43.396
It's me, Honey. It's me.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.153
Is it… Is it you?

33:50.820 --> 33:53.698
Yes, so cut it out.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.702
You're scaring me.

33:59.412 --> 34:03.541
Calm down first and just come out, okay?

34:15.595 --> 34:17.472
-You're lying.
-What?

34:17.555 --> 34:18.598
I'll kill you.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.058
I'll kill you!

34:50.880 --> 34:54.092
How could you still be sleeping?
We have to get there on time.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.385
I'm sorry. I went to bed really late.

34:57.386 --> 35:00.056
Come in for a minute.
I'll get ready real quick.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.599
You need to hurry.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.559
They said no at first.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.187
They barely agreed to let us come
when nobody is around.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.730
We can't be late.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.357
I'll be right out.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.643
Aly, you poor thing.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.563
Don't suffer there.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.485
You should say something.

35:57.446 --> 36:00.324
I'm sorry, friend.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.580
ROOM 2

36:08.958 --> 36:10.168
It's sad.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.713
I won't be able to
see you anymore, Detective Choi.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.757
I would like to come by
to share some homemade food with you.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.134
Will that be all right?

36:24.307 --> 36:26.934
What is it? I can't accept it.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.936
You already gave me so much.

36:29.729 --> 36:30.771
Please accept it.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.733
I didn't do that much for you.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.570
Oh gosh.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.615
I'm sad about this situation.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.784
Ms. Jung.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.037
When did we first meet?

36:46.787 --> 36:48.873
It was after my wife had died.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.001
So it's been quite a long time.

36:53.377 --> 36:54.545
I know.

36:55.546 --> 36:58.382
Karmic connections
between people is very precious--

36:58.466 --> 36:59.592
Ms. Jung.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.636
I have something to tell you.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.263
Yes?

37:06.933 --> 37:09.310
Please go ahead.

37:13.731 --> 37:16.484
Who are you really?

37:22.281 --> 37:24.158
I knew this day would happen.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.038
How much did you find out, Detective Choi?

37:30.957 --> 37:32.208
That your duty

37:32.959 --> 37:34.126
is to spy on me.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.504
That's my hunch.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.841
I…

37:45.805 --> 37:47.098
I…

37:49.058 --> 37:50.476
I lost my son

37:52.853 --> 37:55.439
in the terrorist attack that took place

37:58.234 --> 38:00.236
at Saju Station in 1987.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.948
After that,

38:04.782 --> 38:05.950
I lived

38:06.534 --> 38:09.412
like a crazy person for several years.

38:10.955 --> 38:15.751
I asked myself why my son had to die.

38:17.670 --> 38:20.131
What did I do to deserve that?

38:21.882 --> 38:26.387
How could I temper the rage I felt

38:26.470 --> 38:28.264
that was burning inside me?

38:30.975 --> 38:32.143
And

38:33.602 --> 38:35.229
a person called Guru appeared

38:36.355 --> 38:38.733
and comforted you, right?

38:39.775 --> 38:42.320
That is how you joined
the Youngjin sect, I presume.

38:43.362 --> 38:46.407
When he talks to me,

38:47.908 --> 38:51.078
he washes away
the heart-wrenching agony I feel.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.289
It just goes away.

38:55.791 --> 38:59.086
He has shown us the path
that we are taking together.

39:01.756 --> 39:06.135
Even if your loss was caused by Guru
in the first place?

39:08.387 --> 39:10.514
What happened in the past is over.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.350
You have to look to the future.

39:25.488 --> 39:26.822
Thank you for your service.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.949
Wish you good health.

39:29.992 --> 39:31.118
Detective Choi.

39:39.043 --> 39:42.129
I was ordered to retrieve
this videotape from you.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.383
But the Youngjin sect sent it,
didn't they?

39:45.466 --> 39:47.009
There was a miscommunication.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.887
So our representative
ordered me to retrieve this.

39:51.639 --> 39:55.017
The Youngjin sect has had a few missteps.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.604
But once he returns,

39:58.687 --> 40:01.565
we'll be guided to the right path again.

40:03.984 --> 40:07.113
What the heck do you people want?

40:07.196 --> 40:09.657
We don't want anything.

40:11.158 --> 40:13.494
We merely follow his plan.

40:15.663 --> 40:16.872
I see.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.376
Thank you for being honest
about the videotape.

40:20.459 --> 40:22.545
You could have just left
without telling me.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.422
Detective Choi.

40:27.049 --> 40:28.259
I have

40:29.593 --> 40:31.178
one last piece of advice for you.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.225
If you can't escape it,

40:37.059 --> 40:38.519
just embrace it.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.538
Sit there for a minute.

40:58.497 --> 41:00.207
And drink something.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.221
The restaurant is a total mess.

41:15.681 --> 41:17.600
I guess we can't reopen the restaurant.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.728
Don't worry about that.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.731
That's not important right now.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.194
-Mom.
-Yes?

41:31.071 --> 41:32.114
Don't you regret it?

41:34.825 --> 41:35.951
What do you mean?

41:38.787 --> 41:40.581
For adopting me and that bastard.

41:44.710 --> 41:48.464
Bad things keep happening
ever since you adopted us.

41:51.425 --> 41:53.302
If that bastard and I had never come…

41:53.385 --> 41:54.803
Don't say such things.

41:55.971 --> 41:58.057
How can you call your brother a bastard?

41:59.308 --> 42:03.103
Even if everyone else calls him that word,
you shouldn't.

42:06.524 --> 42:09.109
They say life is full of ups and downs.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.905
But I've never regretted anything.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.324
So don't you ever

42:16.242 --> 42:17.701
say that again.

42:27.836 --> 42:29.088
I'm sorry.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.889
I'll go out to get some fresh air.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.350
I'd like to go outside.
I haven't been out lately.

42:43.435 --> 42:44.562
All right.

42:46.105 --> 42:47.773
Be careful. Don't get hurt or anything.

43:57.801 --> 43:58.969
Jung-hyun.

44:03.557 --> 44:05.100
Why do people

44:07.019 --> 44:09.188
just forget everything?

44:12.024 --> 44:14.068
Why do they end up forgetting

44:15.569 --> 44:17.446
when they can't endure something anymore?

44:18.155 --> 44:19.490
What are you talking about?

44:20.616 --> 44:22.451
So I gave it a lot of thought.

44:22.534 --> 44:25.329
What could I do

44:25.412 --> 44:28.666
that would make people
never forget something?

44:30.042 --> 44:33.921
The terrorist attack at the train station
a few days ago…

44:34.963 --> 44:36.507
I did that.

44:37.383 --> 44:41.720
And you and your friends
help me pull it off.

44:42.304 --> 44:44.431
What do you mean?

44:44.515 --> 44:45.808
It's exactly what I said.

44:46.475 --> 44:49.603
The terrorists behind
the Saju station gas attack are us.

44:49.687 --> 44:50.687
What?

44:50.771 --> 44:53.690
What the hell are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

44:55.025 --> 44:58.195
You don't remember anything.
I wiped the memory of it.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.375
That hellish place…

45:11.959 --> 45:15.087
The same thing happened
when we left the welfare center.

45:15.879 --> 45:18.549
So whatever happens, you'll be all right.

45:19.258 --> 45:20.384
Because

45:21.009 --> 45:23.804
I will erase all memories of it

45:25.139 --> 45:27.015
like I did that time.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.896
You're not weak.

45:34.356 --> 45:36.108
But you're not strong either.

45:37.192 --> 45:38.986
So it's all right.

45:40.070 --> 45:42.072
Just do as I say.

45:46.118 --> 45:49.204
No matter how I look at it,
I think you're going too far.

45:50.747 --> 45:51.748
I need this.

45:52.374 --> 45:54.042
That's why I'm asking you.

45:54.126 --> 45:57.087
I know you're asking for it
because you deemed it very important.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.131
But we can't justify such a request.

45:59.214 --> 46:01.592
You only have suspicions.

46:07.389 --> 46:09.141
We'll approach it differently then.

46:09.975 --> 46:13.395
We'll tag along
with Professor Koo Byung-min.

46:14.062 --> 46:15.856
That's how you'll gain access?

46:15.939 --> 46:18.066
But will she allow it?

46:18.150 --> 46:19.318
She will.

46:19.985 --> 46:21.195
I'm certain of it.

46:21.278 --> 46:22.738
Why are you so sure?

46:28.076 --> 46:29.161
Hello?

46:30.204 --> 46:31.288
What? Where?

46:34.541 --> 46:35.626
Hang up. Got it.

46:41.048 --> 46:42.799
We've got another murder.

47:51.535 --> 47:54.955
Chief, you didn't have to
come all the way here.

47:55.038 --> 47:56.873
We're handling the case now.

47:56.957 --> 47:58.166
Is that so?

47:58.250 --> 48:02.629
It's hard to tell if this murder falls
under the special investigative unit.

48:03.547 --> 48:05.173
Even though it's unclear,

48:05.257 --> 48:08.677
we need your cooperation
in handling these cases, Chief.

48:08.760 --> 48:09.886
That would avoid confusion.

48:09.970 --> 48:13.807
There has to be thunder
and lightning for confusion to occur.

48:15.309 --> 48:18.562
Oh gosh. Now, let's not get carried away.

48:18.645 --> 48:19.605
Chief.

48:22.649 --> 48:25.235
We're willing to cooperate
with your unit, of course.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.029
Please cooperate with us, okay?

48:27.112 --> 48:30.449
You're treating us as if we're here
to tamper with the crime scene.

48:31.158 --> 48:32.159
What?

48:33.744 --> 48:35.037
Geez…

48:45.505 --> 48:48.800
See, I told you
we're lower on the pecking order.

48:50.552 --> 48:51.887
Did you find anything?

48:52.638 --> 48:53.639
It's the same pattern.

48:54.306 --> 48:56.600
They kill a family member
and then kill themselves.

48:57.267 --> 49:00.062
It's like the murder committed
by Lee Kyung-jin.

49:00.896 --> 49:03.231
It's how Shi-jung and his wife
were killed too.

49:06.401 --> 49:07.402
Let's proceed…

49:10.322 --> 49:12.824
with the idea you had.

49:17.579 --> 49:19.623
I wish that they will approach me.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.459
And I wish

49:24.086 --> 49:26.171
they will ask me a question.

49:29.007 --> 49:31.385
Although I can't give an answer,

49:32.219 --> 49:34.221
I can help them reach that answer.

49:38.183 --> 49:40.727
I'm a small lake, river,

49:41.436 --> 49:43.271
and vast ocean.

49:46.775 --> 49:48.443
If you enter my world,

49:48.527 --> 49:52.489
you'll be able to see
the world underneath the water.

49:55.742 --> 49:58.203
You're the only one…

50:01.456 --> 50:03.291
who knows what exists underwater.

50:04.626 --> 50:08.547
That is the reason
why we are here right now.

50:24.896 --> 50:26.690
PROFESSOR KOO BYUNG-MIN
DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY

50:40.704 --> 50:43.290
PROFILE REPORT: JO KYUNG-HO

50:50.464 --> 50:53.425
SAJU PENITENTIARY

50:56.303 --> 50:57.554
Yes.

50:57.637 --> 50:58.764
Yes, sir.

51:09.566 --> 51:12.652
This is used as a break room
for our staff.

51:12.736 --> 51:17.073
Sometimes we use it for special events.

51:17.741 --> 51:21.411
It might look ordinary,
but we have guards standing outside.

51:21.495 --> 51:25.290
If anything happens,
you can blow this whistle to call them.

51:25.373 --> 51:26.416
Okay, thank you.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.418
Feel free to tell me
if you need anything else.

51:32.005 --> 51:34.800
I'm surprised. I thought
the whole process would be harder.

51:34.883 --> 51:37.260
But the procedure is very simple.

51:40.388 --> 51:41.890
You're okay, right?

51:42.974 --> 51:44.434
You don't look well.

51:45.519 --> 51:46.728
I have a headache.

52:09.876 --> 52:12.128
You don't need to worry about it.

52:12.212 --> 52:14.714
That is to announce
random inspections we do every week.

52:14.798 --> 52:18.426
Oh, that's a relief.
I thought there was a situation.

52:18.510 --> 52:20.554
I'll leave the door open for a minute.

52:20.637 --> 52:23.348
The escort team just radioed us.
They're almost here.

52:59.926 --> 53:01.136
Jung-hyun.

53:04.681 --> 53:07.517
You can't change anything now.

53:07.601 --> 53:09.019
We can't change what we did.

53:10.145 --> 53:13.273
And you can't change this very moment

53:14.900 --> 53:16.776
when you've learned the truth.

53:18.069 --> 53:21.072
That's the fact which I know.

53:23.491 --> 53:26.745
The only way to free yourself

53:27.454 --> 53:29.331
is to forget, right?

53:56.942 --> 53:58.652
I exist.

54:00.236 --> 54:03.073
And I have power.

54:06.534 --> 54:09.871
So think carefully and answer me.

54:11.289 --> 54:12.415
Jung-hyun.

54:14.668 --> 54:18.088
Would you like me to erase this memory

54:19.297 --> 54:20.715
for you?

54:50.745 --> 54:53.623
Hello Jo Kyung-ho. Nice to meet you.

54:55.291 --> 54:56.418
Hello.

54:57.210 --> 54:58.753
Would it be okay if you sat there?

55:15.103 --> 55:16.646
We'll wait outside.

55:16.730 --> 55:19.065
Call us if you need anything.

55:19.149 --> 55:20.275
Just a minute.

55:21.109 --> 55:24.404
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho, aren't your hands
uncomfortable?

55:25.780 --> 55:27.073
These cuffs?

55:27.157 --> 55:30.452
If they're uncomfortable, I can have them
removed during this session.

55:30.535 --> 55:32.078
It doesn't matter. I'm fine.

55:38.293 --> 55:39.919
Let me introduce myself.

55:40.003 --> 55:42.380
I'm Koo Byung-min.

55:42.464 --> 55:44.841
I teach psychology at Saju University.

55:45.550 --> 55:48.303
He's my research partner
and also an associate professor.

55:48.386 --> 55:49.721
His name is Kim Seung-dae.

55:49.804 --> 55:50.680
And he's…

55:53.558 --> 55:56.853
Would you like to introduce yourself?

56:01.691 --> 56:03.401
I'm Choi Hyung-in.

56:04.861 --> 56:06.237
I'm part of the MIU

56:07.572 --> 56:09.491
at the Gyeongnam Provincial Police Agency.

56:09.574 --> 56:10.784
Yes, hello.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.705
Thank you for agreeing to meet with us.

56:15.789 --> 56:20.251
Would it be okay for us to videotape
this interview?

56:26.382 --> 56:27.717
Yes, it's okay.

56:29.260 --> 56:32.138
But can I ask for something
before we start?

56:32.222 --> 56:33.556
Sure. What do you need?

56:33.640 --> 56:35.141
Can I have a smoke?

56:35.225 --> 56:36.309
Of course.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.645
Ask the guard if they have a cigarette.

56:38.728 --> 56:40.230
-Okay.
-There's no need for that.

56:41.898 --> 56:43.274
I have a pack.

56:54.786 --> 56:56.037
Thank you.

57:43.877 --> 57:44.919
Excuse me.

57:46.212 --> 57:47.839
Aren't you Jung-hyun?

57:48.423 --> 57:49.549
It's you, right?

57:52.635 --> 57:53.553
Hi Min-jae.

57:53.636 --> 57:56.055
What are you doing here?

57:56.139 --> 57:59.350
Oh gosh. I was passing by in my car
and saw someone out in the rain.

57:59.434 --> 58:01.644
You didn't have an umbrella,
so I came to check.

58:01.728 --> 58:03.062
Oh my goodness.

58:03.146 --> 58:05.940
I didn't realize it was raining.

58:06.024 --> 58:09.194
What were you thinking?
How did you not know?

58:10.320 --> 58:12.780
I was just thinking about something.

58:13.406 --> 58:16.826
-About a decision I made a long time ago.
-But still…

58:17.535 --> 58:18.828
Are you really okay?

58:21.372 --> 58:22.540
I don't know.

58:23.541 --> 58:25.001
I don't know, Min-jae.

58:26.211 --> 58:27.212
To be honest,

58:28.171 --> 58:30.006
I can't remember that day.

58:31.883 --> 58:33.134
Which means…

58:36.304 --> 58:38.139
I can only believe what I was told.

58:39.599 --> 58:41.476
But I suddenly had a thought.

58:42.060 --> 58:44.938
Now I only have one option left.

58:46.397 --> 58:47.857
Because

58:49.025 --> 58:50.193
I can never

58:51.361 --> 58:53.571
go back to who I used to be.

58:55.448 --> 58:57.367
I'm never going to

58:59.911 --> 59:01.621
run away again.

59:13.174 --> 59:16.469
On that day by the river,
you asked him to erase your memories.

59:18.096 --> 59:21.474
You were able to forget the truth
while living your life.

59:22.725 --> 59:25.144
So you should be grateful
for that, Jung-hyun.

59:34.487 --> 59:36.531
You just have to play a role in his plan.

59:37.407 --> 59:38.908
That's all you need to do.

59:44.122 --> 59:45.999
I'll let you go just this once.

59:46.791 --> 59:48.459
Don't ever reject him

59:50.128 --> 59:52.338
and your reality again, okay?

59:52.422 --> 59:53.381
No…

59:59.137 --> 1:00:02.223
Speak louder and repent
so that everyone can hear you.

1:00:02.307 --> 1:00:03.224
Jae-young…

1:00:08.730 --> 1:00:09.897
What did you say?

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:12.817
Jae-young!

1:00:13.484 --> 1:00:14.902
Jae-young!

1:00:15.653 --> 1:00:17.655
Jae-young!

1:00:17.739 --> 1:00:19.532
Don't worry, Jae-young!

1:00:19.616 --> 1:00:21.451
Jae-young! Don't worry!

1:00:21.534 --> 1:00:24.287
Jae-young, I'll save you!

1:00:24.370 --> 1:00:26.748
Don't worry. Don't worry at all.

1:00:26.831 --> 1:00:28.583
Hang in there, Jae-young!

1:00:28.666 --> 1:00:30.084
Jae-young!

1:00:48.603 --> 1:00:49.729
Shall I begin?

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:52.482
You can begin anytime you want.

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:55.943
Where should I start?

1:00:56.027 --> 1:00:59.405
You can talk about what you remember
from the beginning.

1:01:00.031 --> 1:01:01.658
The beginning?

1:01:05.411 --> 1:01:06.954
So I guess

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:11.125
that would mean the day I was born?

1:01:12.877 --> 1:01:16.923
I think we should begin talking
about Jo Jae-young.

1:01:17.924 --> 1:01:21.219
Oh, that's what you think?
I should begin with her, Jae-young?

1:01:27.725 --> 1:01:29.477
I haven't done this before.

1:01:30.436 --> 1:01:33.856
So it could take a while
to get to the heart of the matter.

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:34.982
Is that okay?

1:01:37.735 --> 1:01:39.570
You don't have to worry about anything.

1:01:40.697 --> 1:01:44.659
I remember every detail,

1:01:47.495 --> 1:01:49.247
so you won't find it boring.

1:02:59.942 --> 1:03:00.777
<i>Jae-young.</i>

1:03:02.111 --> 1:03:05.448
Do you think you could have stopped it
if you were able to go back in time?

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:09.911
<i>-Someone already knew about this place.
-Don't you think you should forget things</i>

1:03:10.578 --> 1:03:11.871
that need to be forgotten?

1:03:11.954 --> 1:03:15.583
I have a plan, you see.
And I need your help.

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:21.088
<i>Could you show me that videotape?</i>

1:03:22.465 --> 1:03:24.550
<i>That allows me to see the beginning</i>

1:03:25.343 --> 1:03:26.344
What the hell is this?

1:03:26.427 --> 1:03:28.179
<i>and the end and everything in between.</i>

1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:34.352
