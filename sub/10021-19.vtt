00:07.023 --> 00:08.547
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:10.760 --> 00:13.854
Give him back to me!
Give him to me!

00:14.064 --> 00:17.932
Group therapy in your first week?
All I did was observe.

00:18.134 --> 00:19.533
I'm going to have a baby.

00:19.736 --> 00:23.137
I heard there might be a surgical
trauma fellowship run out of the ER.

00:23.339 --> 00:26.206
It was my idea.
I brought it to Greene and Weaver.

00:26.409 --> 00:27.637
I need time for Reece.

00:27.844 --> 00:31.507
- Don't make him an excuse to screw me!
- I'll find something else!

00:31.715 --> 00:33.945
I don't want you to forfeit it to me.

00:34.150 --> 00:36.846
If you want it, go for it!
I'll still get it!

00:56.206 --> 00:57.696
- Morning, Carol.
- Morning.

00:57.907 --> 00:59.875
Did you see that beautiful blue sky?

01:00.076 --> 01:02.704
I came in when it was
still dark. Cracker?

01:02.912 --> 01:04.402
No, thanks. What are you doing?

01:04.614 --> 01:06.912
I woke up with a sudden urge to clean.

01:07.117 --> 01:10.109
Do you realize this peritoneal lavage
kit expired in 1996?

01:10.320 --> 01:14.780
If your symptoms persist, maybe you
could work your magic on Admit.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.289
Yeah. I think I've been cured,
thanks.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.257
Well, it was worth a shot.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.188
Good morning, Ron.

01:26.603 --> 01:27.763
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

01:27.971 --> 01:29.336
I wasn't looking.

01:29.539 --> 01:30.836
You're looking bright.

01:31.040 --> 01:36.034
I'm presenting on a panel at the
Chicago Society of Trauma Physicians.

01:36.246 --> 01:39.079
I'll stop griping about attending.
What's your topic?

01:39.282 --> 01:43.082
Ultrasound versus CT in blunt abdominal
trauma. I've had good findings.

01:43.286 --> 01:44.913
I'll look forward to it.

01:55.131 --> 01:58.123
Hey, man! You want to try
giving it to me next time?

01:59.402 --> 02:03.463
The proper way to throw a Frisbee
is off the middle finger, sidearm.

02:05.308 --> 02:08.835
For me, it's the flick of the wrist
that gives it that rotation.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.374
Great catch.

02:12.582 --> 02:15.915
For me, the key to Frisbee
is a light touch.

02:18.087 --> 02:19.611
So you're on your way to work.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.348
My shift begins in 15 minutes,
and today's my last day.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.428
I thought things were going
well with the INS.

02:27.630 --> 02:30.224
Oh, it is. I got amnesty.

02:31.534 --> 02:32.694
Congratulations.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.301
Thank you.

02:34.504 --> 02:38.372
I'm going to school to get
my civil engineering license.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.975
You and IKubby gonna stay here
in Chicago?

02:41.177 --> 02:42.201
- Great.
<i>- Carol?</i>

02:42.412 --> 02:45.347
Do you know anything about
this woman, Coco Robbins?

02:45.548 --> 02:48.108
Her and her baby are coming
into the clinic.

02:48.318 --> 02:52.379
She's schizophrenic and Social Services
is having us monitor her baby care?

02:52.589 --> 02:54.352
To make sure she's taking her meds.

02:54.557 --> 02:57.958
- That's a pretty risky proposition.
- She deserves a chance.

02:58.161 --> 03:00.891
So this was your idea?

03:01.097 --> 03:04.897
I'm in touch with the halfway house
where they are living.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.262
I'll volunteer for her appointments.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.534
You asked me to be responsible
for the clinic.

03:11.174 --> 03:13.369
I didn't know anything about this.

03:14.744 --> 03:17.577
You're right. I'm sorry.

03:17.981 --> 03:20.279
I should've told you about it.

03:21.050 --> 03:23.450
No, Carol. You should've asked.

03:24.854 --> 03:26.446
She's due in a few minutes.

04:20.209 --> 04:21.176
What are you doing?

04:21.377 --> 04:23.538
- Drafting teams for baseball.
- Want in?

04:23.746 --> 04:25.737
- Can I draft IKen Griffey?
- He's mine.

04:25.949 --> 04:27.177
I've got Sammy Sosa.

04:27.383 --> 04:30.318
Because he's got the "cutest buns
in baseball."

04:30.520 --> 04:34.581
How would you like to perform a
righteous act and make me a happy man?

04:35.058 --> 04:39.358
Dean signed us for a mentoring project
at the Math/Science Magnet School.

04:39.562 --> 04:43.658
They put some of their top students
into area hospitals like...

04:43.866 --> 04:45.197
...an independent study program.

04:45.401 --> 04:49.201
I need you to hold his hand
and give him a few errands to run.

04:49.405 --> 04:50.872
- Okay.
- Good.

04:51.074 --> 04:55.374
It is a public school, but I'm
assured he's not a convicted felon.

04:55.578 --> 04:56.806
When is this happening?

04:57.013 --> 04:59.311
Anytime now.
The kid's name is Antoine.

04:59.515 --> 05:00.777
- Oh, today?
- Yeah.

05:00.984 --> 05:03.646
Don't leave him unattended
around the drug lockup.

05:03.853 --> 05:05.377
- Thank you.
- What's wrong?

05:05.588 --> 05:07.579
Nothing. Are you back with us?

05:07.790 --> 05:08.950
No, I'm still in Psych.

05:09.158 --> 05:12.150
You'll be back soon.
Don't get used to the cushy life.

05:12.362 --> 05:14.455
Yeah, I won't. Sally MclKenna?

05:15.264 --> 05:16.492
Did they get the glass out?

05:16.699 --> 05:20.863
The doctor is still with your husband.
I'm a student doctor in Psychiatry.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.230
Can I ask a few questions?

05:22.438 --> 05:25.271
Michael's been very stressed out.
He's in law school.

05:25.475 --> 05:27.841
He's never done anything like this.

05:28.044 --> 05:30.239
The doctor said he attacked a car?

05:30.613 --> 05:34.344
He was working on a paper for the last
few days, so I left him alone.

05:34.550 --> 05:37.246
And today I woke up
and he was in the street...

05:37.453 --> 05:39.580
...smashing our car with a bat.

05:39.789 --> 05:42.519
Does Michael have any history
of psychiatric problems?

05:42.725 --> 05:44.818
- Not at all.
- Michael ever use any drugs?

05:45.028 --> 05:47.861
No! Never. I mean, well...

05:48.064 --> 05:48.928
He'll drink a few beers.

05:49.132 --> 05:52.363
A few beers doesn't make
a person freak out like that.

05:52.568 --> 05:55.196
I think it's just a buildup
of stress.

05:55.405 --> 05:58.272
I will talk to your husband
as soon as the ER docs are done.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.740
Hey, Jeanie. Still doing triage?

06:01.944 --> 06:04.435
- So how are you feeling?
- Not bad.

06:06.015 --> 06:09.746
Any side effects from the ribavirin?

06:10.353 --> 06:12.913
- Nausea, fatigue...
- Peter, please. I'm fine.

06:13.523 --> 06:16.458
You look a little tired.
Why don't I check your LFTs?

06:16.659 --> 06:18.388
If the meds don't work,
we need to know.

06:18.594 --> 06:20.721
I've got a lab appointment today.

06:22.398 --> 06:24.229
Listen, if you need me...

06:24.467 --> 06:27.402
Thanks. Excuse me,
I've got patients I need to triage.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.670
Carol, your appointment
hasn't shown up.

06:30.873 --> 06:33.603
- What?
- Coco Robbins and her baby are late.

06:34.277 --> 06:36.507
- Did she call?
- I tried calling her.

06:36.712 --> 06:38.646
No one has seen her.

06:38.848 --> 06:39.940
Maybe I should go over there.

06:40.149 --> 06:43.448
Maybe you should call Children and
Family Services or the police.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.177
I didn't think she'd do this.

06:45.388 --> 06:47.618
If she doesn't stay on her meds,
there's nothing we can do.

06:49.392 --> 06:52.259
There's someone here to see you,
a Coco Robbins.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.964
Coco, are you all right?
Where have you been?

07:00.169 --> 07:03.468
On my way. I know I'm early.
I wasn't sure I should bother you.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.197
- Early?
- Twelve noon.

07:05.408 --> 07:07.638
Yeah, they wrote it down for me.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.142
They must have written it down
wrong in the book.

07:10.346 --> 07:14.373
- Is it still okay?
- Yes, she'll take you into the clinic.

07:14.584 --> 07:15.915
How's he doing?

07:16.119 --> 07:18.485
Good. He's so beautiful, isn't he?

07:18.688 --> 07:20.679
He is beautiful.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.751
- Morning, Peter.
- Hey.

07:27.964 --> 07:31.331
I understand the trauma fellowship's
going to happen.

07:34.971 --> 07:38.737
Look, I'm sorry I came down so hard
on you about your interest.

07:38.941 --> 07:42.342
It was really silly of me
to be so proprietary about it.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.343
Apparently, they're expecting
at least 15 applicants.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.879
Really?

07:49.619 --> 07:52.053
Have you given up the cardiothoracic?

07:53.956 --> 07:55.184
I haven't made up my mind.

07:56.859 --> 07:59.987
Well, feel free to apply
for the trauma fellowship.

08:01.464 --> 08:03.091
I appreciate that.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.899
If you do, we have the inside track.
You know, home-team advantage.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.399
Are you planning to go to
the Trauma Conference this afternoon?

08:16.179 --> 08:19.910
I couldn't get away. Romano has me
doing a keyhole cardiac bypass.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.681
Very fancy. I don't think
you'll be missing much.

08:23.886 --> 08:25.854
I understand it's a dull affair.

08:27.623 --> 08:29.181
Yeah. Yeah, probably.

08:30.893 --> 08:35.227
Well, if you'll excuse me, I have
a partial gastrectomy to get to.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.859
Tell me about the patient
who smashed his car.

08:39.068 --> 08:41.366
- I was just going in.
- You haven't worked him up?

08:41.571 --> 08:42.936
The ER just got done with him.

08:43.139 --> 08:46.597
I need you to pull the information
together and present the patient...

08:46.809 --> 08:49.107
...so I can decide
to admit or medicate.

08:49.312 --> 08:50.836
How long will it take?

08:51.047 --> 08:53.208
- Fifteen minutes.
- I'll see you in 10.

08:53.849 --> 08:56.317
- Enjoying your Psych rotation?
- You heard.

08:56.519 --> 09:00.011
As a med student,
your job is to get to know patients...

09:00.223 --> 09:03.351
...not work up all your Resident's
patients for him.

09:03.559 --> 09:06.084
Students who help their
Residents get better grades.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.731
Now's the time to learn about
talking and listening to patients.

09:09.932 --> 09:12.162
Don't let that get lost
in the shuffle.

09:12.368 --> 09:13.801
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

09:14.837 --> 09:18.034
She'll need to stay
for an albuterol treatment.

09:18.241 --> 09:19.435
She'll be fine.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.166
Nita, it's Reverend Lynn.

09:21.377 --> 09:23.675
Would you cancel
my morning appointments?

09:23.879 --> 09:26.143
Yep. I'll give you a call.

09:27.116 --> 09:28.947
Yeah, right. Bye.

09:31.220 --> 09:32.744
Sorry this is taking so long.

09:32.955 --> 09:36.413
You're obviously busy. I can wait.

09:37.393 --> 09:39.122
How'd you do that to your thumb?

09:39.328 --> 09:41.558
Hammering the gutter on my church.

09:41.764 --> 09:43.288
Hurts like hell.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.796
I'm Matthew Lynn.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.697
Hi. Jeanie Boulet.
You're a minister?

09:47.903 --> 09:50.531
South Street AME. You know it?

09:50.740 --> 09:55.234
I'm not a churchgoer. I had my fill
of being told what I couldn't do.

09:55.444 --> 09:56.877
I hear you.

09:57.546 --> 10:01.505
You have a subungual hematoma,
a collection of blood under your nail.

10:01.717 --> 10:05.949
We'll drain it. I'll call a doctor
and give you something for the pain.

10:07.056 --> 10:09.217
It looks like you also have
swollen joints.

10:09.425 --> 10:11.825
Rheumatoid arthritis.
I've had it for years.

10:12.028 --> 10:16.624
I take pills for inflammation, then
more so the first don't cause an ulcer.

10:17.466 --> 10:18.455
That's not much fun.

10:18.668 --> 10:20.295
Oh, I'm pretty lucky.

10:20.503 --> 10:21.993
I've seen worse.

10:22.538 --> 10:26.167
I'd lay off the hammering.
Don't want you having anther accident.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.343
I don't believe in accidents.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.240
If I hadn't hit my thumb,
we would never have met.

10:32.114 --> 10:34.912
- This is a divine intervention.
- Something like that.

10:37.753 --> 10:39.311
You Antoine Bell?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.914
I'm Dr. Carter. How are you doing?

10:42.124 --> 10:44.388
You'll be spending some time with us.

10:44.593 --> 10:45.992
Let me show you around.

10:46.195 --> 10:48.527
It's a little slow now,
but that can change.

10:49.465 --> 10:54.095
Sorry I can't make the conference.
I have a conflict with the committee.

10:54.303 --> 10:57.170
I'll cauterize that bleeder
in the abdominal wall.

10:57.640 --> 11:01.838
If you like, I can leave a copy
of my talk in your office.

11:04.647 --> 11:09.209
I found the positive predictive value
of ultrasounds higher than reported.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.442
Excellent.

11:10.653 --> 11:13.713
By the way, what did you think
of Peter's study?

11:13.923 --> 11:16.016
He told me he wasn't presenting.

11:16.225 --> 11:18.819
I'm talking about
the sternal saw paper...

11:19.028 --> 11:22.327
...he and IKerry got accepted by the
<i>Annals of Emergency Medicine.</i>

11:22.531 --> 11:24.260
Quite provocative.

11:24.467 --> 11:26.196
- Really?
- Yes.

11:26.402 --> 11:30.930
It could attract the grant money we'll
need for the trauma fellowship.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.506
I look forward to reading it.

11:39.415 --> 11:41.315
Michael? Hi.

11:41.517 --> 11:44.281
I'm Lucy IKnight.
How are you feeling?

11:44.487 --> 11:45.545
Pretty embarrassed.

11:46.021 --> 11:49.081
I'm from Psychiatry, and I
want to talk to you briefly.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.158
Law school's been pretty rough
going, your wife said.

11:52.895 --> 11:56.922
Yes, but I got out of my system what
I needed to get out. I'm fine now.

11:58.033 --> 12:00.558
I've felt like smashing things before.

12:01.036 --> 12:03.698
What got you to the point
where you actually did it?

12:04.540 --> 12:07.668
You know, pressure, things.

12:08.677 --> 12:10.144
How have the last few days been?

12:11.280 --> 12:14.408
Just formulating my thoughts.

12:15.217 --> 12:19.347
And how do you cope
with your stress usually?

12:19.555 --> 12:21.386
Not much can be done.

12:21.590 --> 12:25.082
Do you ever have a drink?
Maybe a few beers?

12:25.327 --> 12:26.487
I do.

12:26.929 --> 12:30.262
And have you been drinking more
recently to cope with the stress?

12:32.201 --> 12:33.793
How much in the last few days?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.437
Drinking helps.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.306
Oh, God!

12:41.944 --> 12:44.037
It helps you relax?

12:44.914 --> 12:48.714
It helps them be more quiet.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.480
Who does it make more quiet?

12:54.723 --> 12:56.213
The demons.

12:57.893 --> 13:00.885
You don't believe me.
But I hear them.

13:01.096 --> 13:02.654
Are you hearing them now?

13:03.799 --> 13:06.563
Michael, I'll call Dr. Myers.

13:06.769 --> 13:08.794
I would never hurt my wife.

13:09.271 --> 13:11.262
I'm stronger than they are.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.531
I wouldn't do what they said.

13:14.076 --> 13:16.067
I hit the car instead.

13:18.113 --> 13:20.138
They wanted me to do it to her...

13:21.150 --> 13:22.879
...but I hit the car.

13:26.822 --> 13:31.816
He took three ounces of Enfamil 20
with iron at 4:25 this morning.

13:32.027 --> 13:35.793
He burped at 4:47.
He peed at 5:05.

13:35.998 --> 13:37.659
You're writing this all down?

13:37.867 --> 13:39.767
- Is that okay?
- Of course.

13:39.969 --> 13:43.632
I just want to make sure people
see that I'm getting it all right.

13:44.173 --> 13:48.007
Could you listen to his heart?
It beats so fast.

13:48.210 --> 13:50.838
Babies' hearts beat
faster than adults'.

13:51.046 --> 13:53.981
- It's perfectly normal.
- Oh, good.

13:54.183 --> 13:56.310
I thought maybe something was wrong...

13:56.519 --> 13:58.419
...which is why I came early.

13:58.621 --> 14:01.317
No, he's fine. Aren't you?

14:01.524 --> 14:04.550
Sometimes he spits up a little
after he eats.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.062
Which is perfectly normal
for a happy, healthy baby.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.598
You can relax. He's doing great.
And you're doing great.

14:12.801 --> 14:15.770
I think he's a very lucky little boy.

14:17.139 --> 14:21.075
I have to do right with this.
Better than right.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.006
I know. And you are.

14:23.379 --> 14:26.041
If something goes wrong,
I know I'll lose him.

14:26.515 --> 14:27.812
Are you taking your meds?

14:28.017 --> 14:31.578
Yeah, it's here.
Look at my journal. Here.

14:33.322 --> 14:35.256
Everything's good
at the halfway house?

14:35.457 --> 14:40.360
Great. There's another woman there
with a 2-month-old girl.

14:40.563 --> 14:44.431
Everyone's so nice. They love
having these little babies around.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.062
What's not to love?

14:47.403 --> 14:49.132
Any questions?

14:50.539 --> 14:54.839
- You'll be back in two days?
- Two days, 10 a.m. I'll be here.

14:55.444 --> 15:00.143
You'll have to control your temper.
No more feet through picture frames.

15:00.349 --> 15:03.443
My passion got the better of me.
What can I tell you?

15:03.652 --> 15:06.712
She's lucky that's all I put
my foot through. You married?

15:06.922 --> 15:09.117
- Divorced.
- Dating anybody steady?

15:09.325 --> 15:10.292
Not right now.

15:10.492 --> 15:14.792
There you go. Fast and loose.
Don't let them get their hooks in you.

15:14.997 --> 15:18.728
From the age they grow boobs till
they die they can make you crazy.

15:18.934 --> 15:20.526
Do I tell the truth?

15:22.738 --> 15:24.035
All right.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.874
Stay off this foot for a couple weeks.

15:27.076 --> 15:31.172
No, doc, I can't do that. I gotta
get back out on the dance floor.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.644
I go ballroom dancing a couple,
three times a week.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.976
- Really?
- You dance?

15:37.386 --> 15:40.378
Dancing will turn you
into a chick magnet.

15:41.290 --> 15:43.918
I'd like to dance.
I just never learned how.

15:44.126 --> 15:46.651
Except for my wedding.
I learned to tango.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.592
Oh, the tango. You know what I mean.

15:49.798 --> 15:53.199
All right, Mr. Pipitone.
I'll check in with you later.

15:53.402 --> 15:56.997
- Two weeks? With the foot?
- Two weeks.

15:57.840 --> 16:01.071
Where's your "Scared Straight" kid?
I want to show him the morgue.

16:01.276 --> 16:03.938
He's from the Math/Science
Magnet School.

16:04.146 --> 16:05.943
- Really?
- Who said he was?

16:06.148 --> 16:07.080
No one. My mistake.

16:07.282 --> 16:09.443
Tell him I'm looking for him.

16:13.322 --> 16:14.983
We got a trauma coming in.

16:15.190 --> 16:19.126
Paramedics are bringing in a stabbing
victim. We'll take him there.

16:19.328 --> 16:21.558
I want you to follow along.
Hang back.

16:24.533 --> 16:27.798
- Seth Willows?
- Here we are.

16:29.138 --> 16:31.698
- Mrs. Willows?
- No. I'm Leila Morgan.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.568
This is my foster son, Seth.

16:33.776 --> 16:36.643
Hi, Seth. I'm Nurse Hathaway.
What happened here?

16:36.845 --> 16:38.938
He put his hand through a window.

16:39.481 --> 16:40.743
Can I take a look?

16:40.949 --> 16:42.211
It's not gonna hurt.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.477
Seth, stop! Now, stop this!

16:44.687 --> 16:46.154
Carol, you okay?

16:48.290 --> 16:52.920
- Why don't you take a seat?
- Sit down right there, now, please.

16:53.295 --> 16:56.924
I'm so sorry. We're having such
trouble with him.

16:57.132 --> 16:59.157
I'm gonna get him into an exam room.

16:59.368 --> 17:01.495
I'm also gonna call
for a Psych consult.

17:01.704 --> 17:04.194
We got a 55-year-old man
stabbed in the neck.

17:04.406 --> 17:07.967
BP's 135/82.
Pulse 110. Airway seems okay.

17:08.176 --> 17:10.974
Got a zone-two neck injury.
A good carotid pulse.

17:11.180 --> 17:13.808
What else about the third man?
Was he big? Small?

17:14.016 --> 17:17.713
- Skinny. Not big.
- Are you usually hoarse like this?

17:17.920 --> 17:20.080
- No.
- Could be a nerve injury.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.747
Or expanding hematoma.
Call X-ray. I need a neck film.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.755
Pulse ox 96.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.590
- Want to explore him in the O.R.?
- He's stable.

17:29.798 --> 17:31.322
Skinny and what?
What was he wearing?

17:31.533 --> 17:34.263
- I don't know. Dark clothes.
- On my count.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.171
He needs a tetanus booster.
Gram of Ancef?

17:39.374 --> 17:40.773
Give him three of Unasyn.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.603
- Why wasn't I paged?
- Didn't need you.

17:42.811 --> 17:45.041
Okay, here's the plan.
Chest is clear.

17:45.247 --> 17:48.774
We need angiography, esophagoscopy
laryngoscopy.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.508
We should protect his airway.

17:50.719 --> 17:52.482
I'm covering the ER, all right?

17:52.688 --> 17:54.315
Fine. I'm finished here.

17:54.523 --> 17:57.253
Draw up four of Versed
and 10 of Norcuron.

17:57.459 --> 17:59.450
Sir, we're gonna put you to sleep.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.687
We're putting a tube in your mouth
and you won't be able to speak.

18:02.898 --> 18:04.195
I gotta get the descriptions.

18:04.399 --> 18:05.832
He needs to be intubated.

18:06.034 --> 18:10.027
His wife was DOA at the scene.
The killers are at large.

18:10.239 --> 18:11.206
Please.

18:14.143 --> 18:15.269
All right.

18:16.545 --> 18:20.208
- Was he dark-skinned, light-skinned?
- Medium.

18:22.818 --> 18:24.285
Going my way?

18:24.553 --> 18:26.748
If you're going up to the O.R., I am.

18:27.389 --> 18:29.755
Why so glum on this bright spring day?

18:29.958 --> 18:31.425
I've got a lot on my mind.

18:31.627 --> 18:35.119
- Would that be the trauma fellowship?
- Yeah, it might be.

18:35.330 --> 18:38.060
I'll invite myself to sit
on the selection committee.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.627
Anspaugh says you've got
a fighting chance.

18:40.836 --> 18:43.999
I did have before Peter
decided to apply.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.867
He applied for the trauma fellowship?

18:47.075 --> 18:48.940
Yeah. Hadn't you heard?

18:50.012 --> 18:52.606
No! I must be out of the loop.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.373
I'm sure he was planning to tell you.

18:55.584 --> 18:57.677
I'm sure it was just an oversight.

18:59.087 --> 19:02.454
I am so sorry for the wait.
Someone will be in soon.

19:02.658 --> 19:05.525
The sun is shining,
the birds are singing...

19:05.727 --> 19:08.787
...and after that Vicodin,
I'm feeling no pain.

19:08.997 --> 19:12.956
Wait. Why don't you do my...
What did you call it?

19:13.468 --> 19:14.901
Subungual hematoma.

19:15.103 --> 19:17.401
I see you're a physician assistant.

19:17.606 --> 19:18.732
I'm working triage.

19:18.941 --> 19:20.772
You said it's a simple procedure.

19:20.976 --> 19:23.706
To tell you the truth, I'm not doing
procedures anymore.

19:24.012 --> 19:25.445
Anymore?

19:26.481 --> 19:28.449
I have hepatitis C, Reverend Lynn.

19:28.650 --> 19:30.413
I don't want to risk infecting you.

19:30.619 --> 19:32.610
How could you infect me?

19:33.488 --> 19:35.456
- Well, if I cut myself...
- Cut yourself?

19:36.258 --> 19:37.657
On what?

19:37.860 --> 19:41.318
I thought you just needed
to drain the blood blister.

19:42.164 --> 19:42.994
That's true.

19:43.198 --> 19:45.598
If you're careful,
shouldn't be any problem.

19:47.336 --> 19:48.496
Right.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.937
Remember, I don't believe
in accidents.

19:55.644 --> 19:57.874
What happened to the kid?
Blood freak him out?

19:58.080 --> 20:00.412
Maybe the cop freaked him out.
What was he locked up for?

20:00.616 --> 20:02.607
Antoine is not a juvenile offender.

20:02.818 --> 20:07.778
He attends the Southside Math/Science
School and he's here for a project.

20:10.025 --> 20:13.791
Hi. I'm Lucy IKnight.
And this must be Seth.

20:14.496 --> 20:15.827
How are you doing in there?

20:16.031 --> 20:19.467
I've only had him a few weeks.
He got kicked out of the group home.

20:19.668 --> 20:21.829
I took him on.
I've handled tough ones.

20:22.037 --> 20:23.061
Why was he kicked out?

20:23.272 --> 20:28.005
Too much of a handful. He's been
shuttled around for three years.

20:28.210 --> 20:29.939
How are you feeling, Seth?

20:30.979 --> 20:34.005
I'm sorry about him kicking the nurse.
I gave him Inderal.

20:34.216 --> 20:36.411
- He shouldn't attack.
- Inderal.

20:36.618 --> 20:38.381
That's the latest.

20:38.587 --> 20:40.350
What other medications is he on?

20:40.555 --> 20:45.390
This is what they gave me:
Tegretol for his impulsiveness.

20:45.594 --> 20:49.530
Ritalin and clonidine
for attention deficit.

20:49.731 --> 20:52.165
Mellaril at bedtime to calm him down.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.961
Sounds like he's being overmedicated.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.967
Hey, Seth? You want a cookie?

21:02.544 --> 21:04.739
- So how are things going?
- Okay.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.440
Do you ever get dizzy sometimes?

21:07.916 --> 21:10.885
Sometimes I do get a buzzy feeling
in my head.

21:11.086 --> 21:12.644
Do you find that he's clumsy?

21:12.854 --> 21:14.685
That's what happened here.

21:14.890 --> 21:17.791
He fell against a window
and put his hand through.

21:17.993 --> 21:20.393
This wasn't from an outburst.

21:31.807 --> 21:33.365
I've been looking for you.

21:33.575 --> 21:35.406
You took off right in the middle.

21:35.610 --> 21:38.238
Was it the recurrent laryngeal nerve?

21:38.814 --> 21:41.715
You said he had a nerve injury
making him hoarse.

21:41.917 --> 21:44.112
Was it the recurrent laryngeal nerve?

21:44.319 --> 21:45.684
Yeah, probably.

21:47.522 --> 21:50.252
Supplies the vocal cord muscles.

21:50.459 --> 21:51.824
That's right.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.954
I like this book.

21:59.034 --> 22:00.797
Puncture wound below the nipple.

22:01.003 --> 22:05.064
Tripped and fell on a sprinkler head
while jogging. BP is 95/65.

22:05.273 --> 22:07.969
- Decreased breath sounds on the left.
- It hurts to breathe.

22:09.344 --> 22:11.938
Set up for a chest tube, 32 French.

22:12.147 --> 22:13.842
- Where's my wife?
- On her way.

22:14.049 --> 22:17.314
Okay, everybody, on my count.
One, two, three.

22:17.686 --> 22:19.586
- You okay?
- I just pinched my finger.

22:19.788 --> 22:23.121
- It's all her fault.
- Betadine. Number 10 blade.

22:23.325 --> 22:25.657
And one of Versed.
It's all whose fault?

22:25.861 --> 22:29.820
My wife. Forcing me to exercise.
I should've stayed on the couch.

22:30.032 --> 22:31.363
Carol, chest tube tray.

22:31.566 --> 22:34.729
"It's a beautiful day," she says.
"You should be out."

22:35.070 --> 22:38.267
- Last time I listen to her.
- Okay, just relax.

22:38.473 --> 22:40.134
You should finish your rounds.

22:40.342 --> 22:42.867
I'll be admitting this patient anyway.

22:43.078 --> 22:45.911
All right. Chest impalement,
sixth intercostal space.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.844
Possible injuries below
the diaphragm. Ultrasound?

22:49.051 --> 22:52.646
Abdomen's soft and non-tender.
I think it's just a chest injury.

22:52.854 --> 22:54.845
Well, we can't be too sure, Peter.

22:55.057 --> 22:58.993
Tube's in. Hook up the Thora-Seal,
Carol. Where's Carol?

22:59.761 --> 23:01.752
Pressure's 110.
No way he got the spleen.

23:01.963 --> 23:03.123
Better safe than sorry.

23:03.331 --> 23:06.528
- 200 cc's out of the chest tube.
- No fluid in the abdomen.

23:06.735 --> 23:09.863
- What did I tell you?
- Still could've nicked the diaphragm.

23:10.072 --> 23:13.838
- There was no possibility of that.
- Are we taking him up to the O.R.?

23:14.042 --> 23:15.873
I'm gonna give him a laparotomy.

23:16.078 --> 23:18.103
I prefer a less invasive laparoscopy.

23:18.313 --> 23:20.247
You might miss a viscus injury.

23:20.449 --> 23:23.976
Why don't you take a moment
and figure out what you want to do?

23:24.386 --> 23:25.751
I need your help.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.492
- Are you okay?
- I was cramping. Now I'm spotting.

23:33.695 --> 23:35.629
Is it time for your period?

23:36.198 --> 23:37.995
No, Mark. I'm pregnant.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.563
Do you see a heartbeat?

23:48.577 --> 23:50.977
I can't tell.
It's hard to get a good view.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.612
Come on, Mark.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.847
No. I don't see a heartbeat.

23:56.051 --> 23:57.211
Oh, man!

23:57.419 --> 23:59.819
Carol, it's not necessarily
a blighted ovum.

24:01.456 --> 24:04.425
It's probably just too early
to see with this.

24:04.793 --> 24:09.628
I'll call Radiology and set up an
appointment for a vaginal ultrasound.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.831
Are you planning on going
through with the pregnancy?

24:18.707 --> 24:20.265
I was hoping to, yeah.

24:21.243 --> 24:22.471
What does Doug think?

24:25.614 --> 24:27.445
I figured I'd wait on that one.

24:27.649 --> 24:32.211
Get through the first trimester. If I
miscarry, there's not much to tell.

24:32.587 --> 24:35.078
- He'd want to know either way.
- Yeah, I will.

24:35.290 --> 24:36.780
I'll tell him at some point.

24:36.992 --> 24:41.827
I'm trying to get used to this myself.
Things are complicated enough.

24:43.698 --> 24:46.428
- I'll call for that appointment.
- Thanks, Mark.

24:49.971 --> 24:51.632
You say he's been irritable?

24:51.840 --> 24:53.671
Off and on. IKind of grouchy.

24:53.875 --> 24:56.400
From all the spitting up
and his stomachache.

24:56.611 --> 24:58.078
Has he lost any weight?

24:58.914 --> 25:02.907
I think so, now that you say that.
His pants used to be snug.

25:03.118 --> 25:05.712
- Where do you live?
- Apartment on Cottage Grove.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.913
- Pretty old building?
- Yeah, I'd say so.

25:09.124 --> 25:11.217
Roaches be having family reunions.

25:15.564 --> 25:16.588
Peeling paint?

25:17.065 --> 25:18.327
Peeling everything.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.268
I bet Lonnie likes
to put things in his mouth.

25:21.469 --> 25:22.868
Yeah, he do.

25:23.071 --> 25:24.936
Has he been screened for lead?

25:25.207 --> 25:26.504
Lead? No.

25:27.876 --> 25:29.036
What's wrong with him?

25:29.244 --> 25:32.475
We'll run more tests,
get a better sense of what's wrong.

25:32.681 --> 25:35.809
- So let's get a CBC and a lead level.
- Right.

25:37.619 --> 25:41.020
We're gonna see if his symptoms
are a result of lead poisoning.

25:41.223 --> 25:44.056
Maybe from eating flecks
of paint, which kids do.

25:44.326 --> 25:47.022
The lead-level results
won't be back for a while...

25:47.229 --> 25:49.857
...but we can learn some things
from the blood work.

25:50.065 --> 25:52.056
Just make him better.

25:52.367 --> 25:54.699
Aesop, down.

25:58.006 --> 26:00.338
Dissect and mobilize
the internal mammary.

26:00.542 --> 26:02.373
- Got it.
- Excellent, Peter.

26:02.577 --> 26:06.741
You definitely have the dexterity
for cardiothoracic, no doubt about it.

26:06.948 --> 26:08.540
This is amazing.

26:09.117 --> 26:12.746
- It's like operating a marionette.
- Cutting edge in cardiac bypass.

26:12.954 --> 26:14.979
- Didn't I tell you?
- You told me.

26:15.190 --> 26:17.920
All right, let's keep flooding
the field with CO2.

26:18.126 --> 26:21.584
We'll spoon up the artery
and lift it off the anterior wall...

26:21.796 --> 26:25.630
...and anastomose the mammary to the
anterior branch of the coronary.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.961
Make an end run
around the diseased artery.

26:28.169 --> 26:31.002
You're familiar
with the concept of an end run?

26:31.206 --> 26:34.300
- Of course I am.
- Yes. I know that you are.

26:36.444 --> 26:38.969
High levels of lead can cause...

26:39.180 --> 26:42.616
...basophilic stippling
in the blood cells.

26:44.819 --> 26:47.219
And there it is. See this?

26:48.657 --> 26:53.492
The red cells are hypochromic,
or less red than normal red cells...

26:53.695 --> 26:55.822
...which is a sign of anemia.

26:56.564 --> 26:59.465
Anemia. That's low iron
in the hemoglobin.

26:59.668 --> 27:01.158
That's right.

27:01.536 --> 27:05.438
Red blood cells need iron so they
can deliver oxygen to the tissues.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.541
Right. IKids who are
anemic lack iron...

27:08.743 --> 27:12.543
...which makes it very easy for the
lead to bind to the red blood cells.

27:12.747 --> 27:16.649
So you can see how this puts kids
like Lonnie in a doubly bad position.

27:16.851 --> 27:18.079
How?

27:18.286 --> 27:22.450
Poor children are more likely to be
anemic because of inadequate diet.

27:22.657 --> 27:26.218
And poor kids are more likely
to be exposed to lead paint...

27:26.428 --> 27:29.625
- Because they live in older buildings.
- Yes.

27:30.598 --> 27:34.364
- So this kid's got lead poisoning.
- Looks like a pretty severe case.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.730
Are you upset about something?

27:36.938 --> 27:38.667
Why would I be upset?

27:38.873 --> 27:42.206
I've been talking you up
for the cardiothoracic fellowship...

27:42.410 --> 27:44.537
...to anybody who will listen to me.

27:44.746 --> 27:48.273
And today I find out you're vying
for the ER trauma fellowship.

27:48.483 --> 27:50.212
It's a bit confusing.

27:50.952 --> 27:54.410
Well, I wasn't taking the
cardiothoracic fellowship for granted.

27:54.723 --> 27:58.090
So the trauma fellowship
is just a fallback. I see.

27:58.293 --> 28:01.990
And if you were selected for both,
you would choose...?

28:03.498 --> 28:04.487
Cardiothoracic.

28:07.802 --> 28:11.397
Any indecision you're feeling
about your future, I can help.

28:11.606 --> 28:12.630
Just say the word...

28:12.841 --> 28:16.402
...and I'll take the cardiothoracic
fellowship off the table.

28:17.312 --> 28:18.404
No.

28:18.847 --> 28:20.212
That's my first choice.

28:22.517 --> 28:23.677
Just be clear, Peter.

28:25.854 --> 28:28.914
For your own sake, and mine.

28:35.397 --> 28:38.423
Radiology can see you
at 5:00 for the ultrasound.

28:38.633 --> 28:39.600
Great. Thanks.

28:39.834 --> 28:43.827
Why don't we get out of here?
Take a walk, grab a movie.

28:44.038 --> 28:46.973
I thought you had to go
to a Trauma Conference.

28:47.175 --> 28:49.700
Who wants to hang out
with a bunch of doctors?

28:49.911 --> 28:51.845
Go to the conference. I'm fine.

28:52.046 --> 28:53.104
I just thought we...

28:53.314 --> 28:55.680
I could use this time
by myself right now.

28:56.084 --> 28:59.576
All right. But I'm around
if you need to talk.

29:00.088 --> 29:03.080
- I know.
- I told IKerry you were feeling ill.

29:03.291 --> 29:05.816
So if you have to take off early...

29:06.027 --> 29:07.517
Thanks, Mark.

29:11.433 --> 29:12.422
Nurse Hathaway?

29:15.069 --> 29:17.060
Coco, what are you doing back here?

29:17.272 --> 29:21.265
If I didn't do something right with
the baby, would you have to tell on me?

29:27.081 --> 29:28.571
How are you doing, Seth?

29:28.883 --> 29:31.408
- Got any more cookies?
- Sure I do.

29:31.619 --> 29:33.746
I was talking to your foster mom.

29:34.122 --> 29:37.091
She seems like a pretty nice lady.
What do you think?

29:37.292 --> 29:38.281
She's new.

29:39.260 --> 29:42.058
She said your natural mom
died a few years ago.

29:46.134 --> 29:47.999
I never knew my dad.

29:48.803 --> 29:51.101
It's hard to grow up without a parent.

29:51.306 --> 29:54.434
She died in a car crash.
It was my dad's fault.

29:55.810 --> 29:57.778
That's an awful thing to happen.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.809
Do you think about it a lot?

30:00.014 --> 30:01.003
No.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.075
Does it make you mad sometimes?

30:07.021 --> 30:08.784
You got any more cookies?

30:09.023 --> 30:10.615
That was my last one.

30:11.059 --> 30:14.426
If you don't want to talk about
your parents, we don't have to.

30:14.629 --> 30:16.153
Why do you want to?

30:16.931 --> 30:18.296
I like talking to you.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.468
I want to know what's on your mind.

30:22.370 --> 30:23.701
My dad gets drunk a lot.

30:24.439 --> 30:27.431
That why you have to stay
with foster parents sometimes?

30:27.976 --> 30:29.466
He's an alcoholic.

30:31.813 --> 30:33.906
A lot of people have that problem.

30:34.115 --> 30:36.413
It makes it kind of tough
on you, though.

30:38.186 --> 30:41.713
I only wish that my dad would come
and see me sometime.

30:45.894 --> 30:46.883
<i>Ta</i> x <i>i!</i>

30:47.562 --> 30:49.223
Taxi!

30:49.531 --> 30:50.520
Come on!

30:50.732 --> 30:51.721
Taxi!

30:51.933 --> 30:52.991
Hey!

30:54.035 --> 30:55.764
- Taxi!
- Thanks a lot, buddy.

30:58.239 --> 30:59.831
Hey! Hey!

31:00.041 --> 31:02.771
Thank you very much!

31:04.445 --> 31:05.707
Elizabeth?

31:06.381 --> 31:07.678
You all right?

31:08.383 --> 31:11.113
I cannot get a cab
in this bloody city.

31:12.320 --> 31:16.814
Listen, we can take the EI.
It goes right near the hotel.

31:17.025 --> 31:18.822
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:19.427 --> 31:23.591
I wasn't sure about the bath. Nobody
showed me. I didn't know what to do.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.995
Yes, you did. You knew
to come back and ask for help.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.497
I was afraid to look stupid.

31:29.704 --> 31:31.899
Well, you did the right thing. Hi.

31:33.641 --> 31:36.269
Just support him
with your hand like that.

31:36.477 --> 31:41.710
And then just gently wash him
with a mild soap.

31:42.517 --> 31:44.883
You're good at this.
You must do it a lot.

31:45.086 --> 31:48.317
No, not really.
You'll get good at it too.

31:48.523 --> 31:50.548
Here. Why don't you give it a try?

32:02.503 --> 32:03.561
Hey!

32:04.172 --> 32:06.367
- Hey, Dr. Carter, did you need me?
- Yeah.

32:06.574 --> 32:08.337
Cracking the whip on you, Toine.

32:08.543 --> 32:10.101
- All right.
- All right.

32:10.878 --> 32:14.314
- Friends of yours from school?
- Friends from the neighborhood.

32:14.549 --> 32:17.780
You don't have to worry about the tie.
It's not necessary.

32:17.986 --> 32:20.045
Well, my mom said to wear it.

32:20.888 --> 32:24.221
- You ever had a job before, Antoine?
- No.

32:24.626 --> 32:28.153
This isn't a job, but there are
things I feel I ought to tell you.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.888
Not to give you a hard time, but...

32:31.466 --> 32:34.765
You're bright, you'll learn it anyway.
Might as well be now.

32:34.969 --> 32:36.459
- All right.
- All right?

32:36.671 --> 32:41.267
With any job you have in the future,
things will be expected of you.

32:41.476 --> 32:44.411
- That means no hanging with buddies.
- I had a reason.

32:44.612 --> 32:47.706
I don't want to hear it.
I'm not giving you a hard time.

32:47.915 --> 32:50.213
Just letting you know
what I expect of you.

32:50.418 --> 32:51.544
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

32:51.819 --> 32:53.616
- What's next?
- Specificity.

32:54.789 --> 32:57.189
I got Sensitivity.
It's a little crumpled.

32:57.392 --> 32:58.620
I'll take it.

32:58.826 --> 33:00.919
- Methodologies?
- No.

33:01.129 --> 33:02.687
False Negative Rates?

33:02.897 --> 33:04.330
Bingo.

33:05.133 --> 33:07.499
Okay. Outcomes?

33:07.702 --> 33:10.694
It's got a footprint on it.
Looks kind of interesting.

33:10.905 --> 33:13.601
Oh, it's not very sexy.
Just meta-analysis.

33:13.808 --> 33:16.572
Thought it might help me
bag the trauma fellowship.

33:16.778 --> 33:20.509
- Yeah. Can't hurt.
- Be better if I had it published.

33:20.715 --> 33:22.910
I'm sorry about
that chest wound today.

33:23.117 --> 33:25.381
Why are you sorry?
You did a great job.

33:26.721 --> 33:29.519
Trauma shouldn't be
a battleground for surgeons.

33:29.724 --> 33:31.487
- Oh, you mean Peter.
- Yep.

33:31.693 --> 33:33.923
- Well, that must be tough.
- What?

33:34.128 --> 33:38.087
- Competing with your boyfriend.
- Not boyfriend. Just competing.

33:39.367 --> 33:41.198
- I thought you two were...
- History.

33:42.537 --> 33:43.970
I gotta get better sources.

33:45.206 --> 33:46.605
This is us.

33:52.246 --> 33:55.738
- Think they'll still let me speak?
- Ten minutes? That's nothing.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.542
I was supposed to go first.

33:57.752 --> 34:00.482
Well, you were busy
saving someone in the ER.

34:00.688 --> 34:02.747
- Four hours ago?
- Work with me.

34:07.428 --> 34:11.956
- So why aren't we stopping?
- Guess it's not a weekend stop.

34:12.166 --> 34:13.963
We can get off at the next stop.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.302
- Does that feel better?
- Much.

34:22.976 --> 34:25.377
You should be taking care of people...

34:25.580 --> 34:29.311
...not working up front,
checking pulses and doing paperwork.

34:29.516 --> 34:31.781
I'm sorry I took so long.
I got held up.

34:31.985 --> 34:34.112
- Reverend, how are you?
- Can't complain.

34:34.688 --> 34:38.250
- She's been taking good care of me.
- You two know each other?

34:38.458 --> 34:42.121
Since Peter was a little boy
with straight A's.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.195
I haven't seen you around lately.

34:44.398 --> 34:47.856
Well, I've been pretty busy here
and taking care of Reece.

34:48.069 --> 34:50.731
My mother used to attend
Reverend Lynn's church.

34:50.938 --> 34:53.338
Are you the Jeanie
that helped Mrs. Benton?

34:53.541 --> 34:55.873
- I am.
- She spoke of you.

34:56.944 --> 35:01.472
Just before she passed.
She told me you were her angel...

35:01.682 --> 35:03.411
...that you brought her comfort.

35:05.286 --> 35:08.312
I'll never forget how much
you meant to my mother.

35:08.556 --> 35:12.549
You see? I told you
we didn't meet by accident.

35:13.161 --> 35:15.721
So Dr. Benton and I
are both in your debt.

35:16.297 --> 35:18.959
I'd like to offer
some healing prayers.

35:20.101 --> 35:22.035
I need all the help I can get.

35:23.738 --> 35:27.230
- You mean right now?
- The spirit has moved me.

35:57.538 --> 35:58.732
Amen.

36:05.146 --> 36:06.408
That wasn't so bad.

36:07.982 --> 36:09.006
No.

36:26.367 --> 36:28.062
Conference Room C.

36:31.839 --> 36:33.136
- Which way?
- I don't know.

36:33.474 --> 36:36.102
- You been here before?
- I don't know the rooms.

36:36.310 --> 36:37.743
Conference rooms. Right.

36:37.945 --> 36:40.937
But I'm serious.
I'm gonna marry this girl.

36:45.253 --> 36:47.346
- Sorry.
- Let's get out of here.

36:47.755 --> 36:51.191
Can you tell us where the
Trauma Physicians' Conference is?

36:51.459 --> 36:55.395
- Did you check the directory?
- Conference Room C, but it's a wedding.

36:55.596 --> 36:58.156
That's Ballroom C.
Conference C's on the lower level.

36:58.366 --> 36:59.594
Where's the elevator?

36:59.800 --> 37:01.927
- Through the bar.
- That makes sense.

37:02.136 --> 37:03.569
- Thank you.
- Want a drink?

37:03.771 --> 37:06.831
- Sure. We got time.
- Look! A giant pig ice sculpture.

37:10.845 --> 37:12.005
Oh! Sorry.

37:12.580 --> 37:14.639
She's had a little too much to drink.

37:20.988 --> 37:22.979
So you here for the conference?

37:25.359 --> 37:26.553
It's taking too long.

37:26.761 --> 37:28.752
- Let's take the stairs.
- Good idea.

37:28.963 --> 37:31.727
- You're terrible.
- Who? Me? You ran into them.

37:31.933 --> 37:33.525
- Hurry up.
- I'm in heels!

37:33.734 --> 37:35.292
Well, take them off, woman.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.438
- "Woman"? Did you call me "woman"?
- Who? Me?

37:38.639 --> 37:41.107
I'll let it slide.
You did rush to my rescue.

37:41.309 --> 37:44.801
- I haven't saved you yet.
- At least we can make an appearance.

37:51.152 --> 37:52.585
It's a dead end.

37:56.290 --> 37:57.621
Uh-oh!

37:58.759 --> 38:01.319
- Very funny.
- No, really. It's locked.

38:01.862 --> 38:03.659
You've got to be kidding me.

38:04.799 --> 38:07.791
I think somebody didn't want us
to make this conference.

38:08.002 --> 38:09.196
<i>Dr. Carter?</i>

38:10.137 --> 38:13.072
Could I see you over here
for a minute, please?

38:15.409 --> 38:19.038
This is Sharice Haines.
And this is her son, Andre.

38:19.947 --> 38:22.848
I think he has lead poisoning.
Could you take a look?

38:23.050 --> 38:24.039
Sure.

38:24.251 --> 38:25.809
- Hello.
- Hi.

38:26.020 --> 38:28.511
He's been feeling sick.
I don't know why.

38:28.723 --> 38:33.092
I sent some of my friends to go
bring Andre and his mother in.

38:33.294 --> 38:36.024
- I can examine him now.
- And do those blood tests?

38:36.230 --> 38:40.428
If it's needed. First thing is to
take a history and do a physical exam.

38:40.634 --> 38:44.126
May I see your son?
Let me ask you a few questions.

38:44.338 --> 38:47.034
Dr. Carter? I know it's past 4:00...

38:47.241 --> 38:50.176
...but can I hang around
and see how this goes?

38:50.378 --> 38:51.367
Absolutely.

38:51.912 --> 38:52.901
Thank you.

38:53.981 --> 38:57.417
Does it hurt when I do that, Andre?
When I press right here?

38:57.651 --> 39:01.052
Seth is overmedicated,
sent from one foster home to another.

39:01.255 --> 39:04.418
Each time, he gets a new med
without regard to the old ones.

39:04.625 --> 39:06.024
You found out just in time.

39:06.227 --> 39:10.596
The credit really goes to my student.
Lucy found the problem right away.

39:10.798 --> 39:13.323
- Good job.
- We can put him on proper medication.

39:13.534 --> 39:16.628
I think he could benefit
from psychotherapy as well.

39:16.837 --> 39:20.295
All he really needs is for someone
to listen to him and to care.

39:20.508 --> 39:23.966
Glad to hear you say that.
Most students think it's about meds.

39:24.178 --> 39:28.638
Not many take the time to do therapy.
Residents are like that too, right?

39:28.916 --> 39:30.406
I suppose so.

39:30.618 --> 39:34.782
- You might learn from your student.
- Could I continue counseling this kid?

39:34.989 --> 39:36.456
Your rotation's almost over.

39:36.657 --> 39:41.151
Then I start my second ER rotation.
I'd still like to see him if possible.

39:41.629 --> 39:45.531
I'll supervise you myself.
This would be a great case for you.

39:49.637 --> 39:50.626
Well?

39:50.838 --> 39:51.930
I don't understand.

39:52.139 --> 39:54.334
We can look
into transplants, talk to...

39:54.542 --> 39:56.271
- They're fine.
- What?

39:56.477 --> 40:01.244
My liver function tests are almost
normal. The meds must be working.

40:01.449 --> 40:02.814
Yeah, I'll say.

40:03.017 --> 40:05.815
Maybe I stressed myself out
and made myself sick.

40:06.020 --> 40:10.514
Yeah. I guess you can't underestimate
the power of prayer, huh?

40:17.731 --> 40:20.700
I need you to take everything
off and put on the gown.

40:20.901 --> 40:23.529
The radiologist will be in
very soon, okay?

40:33.547 --> 40:38.143
We have a struggling national
health service, but I believe in it.

40:38.352 --> 40:42.083
No. I meant for the surgeons.
You seem so desperate to stay.

40:42.289 --> 40:45.486
- Am I that transparent?
- Well, not "desperate."

40:45.693 --> 40:49.026
- I like it here. It suits me.
- You don't get homesick?

40:49.763 --> 40:51.196
A little.

40:54.401 --> 40:56.494
I do get Ionely sometimes.

40:56.704 --> 41:00.765
I complain about work. But it's
my most loyal companion, really.

41:01.909 --> 41:05.072
It's hard to get used to it.
You know, being alone.

41:06.413 --> 41:07.402
But...

41:10.417 --> 41:13.113
After a while, you expect it.

41:13.320 --> 41:16.812
I mean, you just
have to appreciate it.

41:17.925 --> 41:20.621
- You really believe that?
- I'm full of crap.

41:21.929 --> 41:23.021
You two locked in?

41:23.230 --> 41:24.458
- Yes.
- Yes.

41:38.979 --> 41:40.913
You still want that drink?

41:41.448 --> 41:42.472
You got it.

41:52.993 --> 41:54.756
You haven't learned your lesson.

41:55.529 --> 41:57.497
It's a character flaw.

41:57.698 --> 41:59.427
I'm a stubborn old mule.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.432
I hear you.

42:03.204 --> 42:04.865
So you're here.

42:06.507 --> 42:07.565
It's a start.

42:11.178 --> 42:12.702
Is there a heartbeat?

42:13.881 --> 42:15.849
You said you've had some cramping?

42:16.050 --> 42:19.019
A little.
And earlier today, some spotting.

42:30.164 --> 42:31.153
There we go.

42:33.167 --> 42:35.692
Right there.
Strong, steady heartbeat.

42:35.903 --> 42:38.667
- Are you sure?
- No doubt about it.

42:41.075 --> 42:42.099
Thank God.

42:42.876 --> 42:46.835
Not 100o/o guarantee that everything
will be okay, but it's a good sign.

42:50.618 --> 42:53.781
- The bubonic plague?
- I was 9 years old.

42:53.988 --> 42:56.286
The counselor said not
to feed squirrels...

42:56.490 --> 42:58.390
...that we might get bubonic plague.

42:58.592 --> 43:00.321
- Could you?
- I don't know.

43:00.527 --> 43:02.518
But Timmy fed the squirrels!

43:02.730 --> 43:04.891
So Timmy had to be
locked in the cabin?

43:05.099 --> 43:06.930
"Timmy." Not "Jimmy."

43:07.134 --> 43:10.126
- I said "Timmy."
- It sounded like "Jimmy."

43:12.973 --> 43:13.962
Listen.

43:16.176 --> 43:18.406
- What?
- It's weird.

43:19.346 --> 43:20.370
What's weird?

43:20.881 --> 43:22.610
They're playing a tango.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.680
You know the tango?

43:28.489 --> 43:29.820
Want to crash a wedding?

43:32.459 --> 43:34.086
You do know how to do this?

43:34.295 --> 43:36.627
It's a traditional
American wedding dance.

43:36.830 --> 43:39.924
- I'm not sure.
- Just follow my lead.
