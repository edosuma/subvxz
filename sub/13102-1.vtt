00:01.583 --> 00:04.125
[dramatic music]

00:15.250 --> 00:17.292
(male #1)
'This is Earth Alliance
Destroyer Acheron'

00:17.375 --> 00:20.042
'to Babylon 5.
We've got your package.'

00:20.125 --> 00:21.333
(male #2)
'Confirmed, Acheron.'

00:21.417 --> 00:22.583
'Lieutenant Corwin
is standing by'

00:22.667 --> 00:24.417
'for delivery
in Docking Bay 4.'

00:24.500 --> 00:26.625
(male #1)
'Roger that, Babylon control.'

00:29.167 --> 00:31.292
(male #3)
'Maintenance,
go to Docking Bay 7.'

00:31.375 --> 00:33.417
'Maintenance, to Bay 7.'

00:43.417 --> 00:44.625
Captain Lochley.

00:44.708 --> 00:46.500
Lieutenant David Corwin
at your service.

00:46.583 --> 00:49.167
Lieutenant. I thought
I was going to be met

00:49.250 --> 00:50.292
by the entire command staff.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.458
Yes, ma'am, but, uh

00:51.542 --> 00:53.625
Mr. Garibaldi just
got back from Mars

00:53.708 --> 00:55.958
and even though he's not
technically on staff anymore

00:56.042 --> 00:58.667
Zack Allan is our new
chief of security these days.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.833
He's up to his ears
helping Zack get ready

01:00.917 --> 01:02.417
for Sheridan's inauguration

01:02.500 --> 01:04.333
as president
of the New Alliance.

01:04.417 --> 01:06.375
And Dr. Franklin had
an emergency in Medlab--

01:06.458 --> 01:08.167
Lieutenant, lieutenant.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.500
Is it always like this
around here?

01:09.583 --> 01:11.333
No. No, it, well..

01:11.417 --> 01:13.208
Actually, yes.

01:13.292 --> 01:14.917
It's-it's hectic, ma'am.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.750
Well, a hectic station
is the first sign

01:16.833 --> 01:18.125
of a poorly run station.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.458
We'll change that.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.458
I've got everyone
standing by in C and C

01:21.542 --> 01:23.292
waiting to meet you
as soon as you're settled in.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.375
Good, good.
I wanna jump right in.

01:25.458 --> 01:27.750
Always takes a while when
you have a change in CO.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.792
The sooner we get on
with the transition, the better.

01:29.875 --> 01:31.875
If there's anything you need
to know about the station..

01:31.958 --> 01:34.500
Just personalities,
any internal conflicts

01:34.583 --> 01:36.125
I need to be made aware of.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.500
Beyond that,
I've thoroughly researched

01:37.583 --> 01:40.042
Babylon 5's
operational procedures

01:40.125 --> 01:41.500
personnel records..

01:41.583 --> 01:43.833
I'm, uh, pretty much up to speed
on all the reports.

01:43.917 --> 01:45.542
Uh, with all due respect

01:45.625 --> 01:48.667
there's a lot that
doesn't fit into a report.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.375
Then the report is incomplete.

01:52.708 --> 01:56.042
[sighs]
Just trying to save you
trouble, captain.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.958
It's been my experience
that as long as you run

02:00.042 --> 02:01.500
an efficient operation

02:01.583 --> 02:03.792
don't go looking for trouble,
you'll do just fine.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.667
Oh, that's one of the things
I was trying to tell you.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.417
Around here we don't
have to look for trouble.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.458
On B-5, trouble comes
looking for us.

02:09.542 --> 02:12.625
[indistinct chatter]

02:21.333 --> 02:24.417
[instrumental music]

02:30.875 --> 02:32.333
Time to go.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.208
I just want you to know
it's nothing personal..

02:36.292 --> 02:38.333
...but I need to send
a message to Babylon 5.

02:40.042 --> 02:42.208
That's what you rangers
are for, right?

02:42.292 --> 02:45.083
Carrying messages
from one place to another.

02:45.167 --> 02:46.708
So you're the right person
in the right place

02:46.792 --> 02:47.917
at the right time.

02:49.375 --> 02:50.542
For me, anyway.

02:50.625 --> 02:53.083
[dramatic music]

02:54.333 --> 02:55.583
Oh!

02:55.667 --> 02:57.458
Almost forgot.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.667
Any final words?

02:59.750 --> 03:01.917
We live for the one.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.875
We die for the one.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.833
Well, one out of two ain't bad.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.708
[zapping]

03:20.333 --> 03:23.417
[instrumental music]

03:35.750 --> 03:37.417
(Kosh)
And so it begins..

03:37.500 --> 03:39.792
- There is a hole in your mind.
What do you want?

03:39.875 --> 03:43.208
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

03:43.292 --> 03:45.583
(General Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

03:45.667 --> 03:47.542
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld?

03:47.625 --> 03:49.292
(Elric)
I see a great hand

03:49.375 --> 03:50.708
reaching out of the stars.

03:50.792 --> 03:52.250
Who are you?

03:52.333 --> 03:54.417
President Clark signed
a decree today declaring..

03:54.500 --> 03:56.750
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

03:56.833 --> 03:58.292
Unless your people get off

03:58.375 --> 03:59.833
their encounter suited butts
and do something.

03:59.917 --> 04:01.417
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.500
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.000
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

04:06.083 --> 04:08.208
Do you have anything
worth living for?

04:08.292 --> 04:09.625
I think of my
beautiful city in flames.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.042
Giants in the playground.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.542
Now get the hell out
of our galaxy!

04:12.625 --> 04:14.458
We are here to place
President Clark

04:14.542 --> 04:15.667
under arrest.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.500
[theme music]

04:50.083 --> 04:53.208
[music continues]

05:04.125 --> 05:06.708
[instrumental music]

05:21.000 --> 05:22.375
Hey.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.083
I thought you were gonna
sleep in a little.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.917
I was about to make breakfast.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.292
I can't.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.708
'I have to get back
to my quarters and change.'

05:29.792 --> 05:31.583
'The new Gaim ambassador
has asked for a meeting'

05:31.667 --> 05:32.583
as soon as possible.

05:32.667 --> 05:33.875
He wants to introduce himself

05:34.000 --> 05:36.250
before the inauguration.
Less awkward that way.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.667
May I ask you a question?

05:41.750 --> 05:44.125
[sighs]
Delenn, you're-you're
living here now

05:44.208 --> 05:45.250
at least part of the time.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.042
Ask whatever you want.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.750
Why are there wet socks

05:48.833 --> 05:51.000
hanging in the shower?

05:51.083 --> 05:52.333
I just washed them.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.333
Don't you use the thermal unit?

05:54.417 --> 05:55.958
For everything else, yes.

05:57.375 --> 05:58.500
I, uh..

05:58.583 --> 06:01.583
I guess
it's kind of a tradition.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.500
See, when I first
joined Earthforce

06:03.583 --> 06:06.792
I was assigned to
the 54th North American unit

06:06.875 --> 06:08.583
and the sergeant
of our squadron..

06:08.667 --> 06:11.250
We used to call him
Sergeant Slaughter

06:11.333 --> 06:14.250
was the toughest,
meanest DI we ever saw

06:14.333 --> 06:17.750
and he used to wash
his own socks every morning.

06:17.833 --> 06:19.250
He told us

06:19.333 --> 06:21.458
"I'm gonna live forever.
You know why?

06:21.542 --> 06:24.417
"Because I never leave
the barracks unless I know

06:24.500 --> 06:27.417
"I've got something to do
when I get back.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.250
"The only kind of man
that gets killed

06:29.333 --> 06:31.000
"is the man who is done doin'

06:31.083 --> 06:32.292
"whatever it is he's doin'.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.542
"And I know I'm gonna
come back alive

06:34.625 --> 06:36.500
"'cause I got socks to wash.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.208
Any of you maggots got
a problem with that?"

06:38.292 --> 06:39.375
I assume you said no.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.292
Ooh, loud and clear.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.458
The next morning at reveille,
we-we came up with

06:43.542 --> 06:45.583
this big ceremony
and we all took a vow

06:45.667 --> 06:47.958
that for as long as
we were in uniform

06:48.042 --> 06:51.458
we would wash our own socks
every morning.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.625
You know, I think
it's the first time I ever saw

06:53.708 --> 06:57.250
old Sergeant Slaughter
actually smile.

06:57.333 --> 07:01.667
The newly elected president
of the Interstellar Alliance

07:01.750 --> 07:03.625
about to be
officially sworn in

07:03.708 --> 07:06.417
washing his own socks?

07:06.500 --> 07:09.750
You're a very strange man,
even for a human.

07:09.833 --> 07:10.875
Why, thank you.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.083
[beeping]

07:14.125 --> 07:15.417
Sheridan. Go.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.917
(Corwin)
'Captain Lochley's aboard, sir.'

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
'We just got her settled in.'

07:20.083 --> 07:22.250
Uh, good, uh, have her
meet me in my office

07:22.333 --> 07:23.667
in 20 minutes.

07:23.750 --> 07:24.958
Lochley?

07:25.042 --> 07:26.542
Ivanova's replacement.

07:28.167 --> 07:29.833
So much for breakfast.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.292
My place tonight?

07:31.375 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, I guess.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.750
Uh, I am gonna be working
late here, though, tonight.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.000
You know, I hope
this is going to work

07:39.083 --> 07:40.667
alternating between
your place and mine.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.250
Oh, I know, I know.

07:42.333 --> 07:45.208
But, uh, there is no room here
for my belongings

07:45.292 --> 07:46.750
I don't have room for yours

07:46.833 --> 07:48.417
and I should conduct
Minbari business

07:48.500 --> 07:49.875
in Minbari surroundings.

07:49.958 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.167
It's good to keep things
separate for now.

07:53.250 --> 07:57.042
Until we can move to
the new facilities on Minbar.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.250
Assuming you're still
comfortable

07:59.333 --> 08:00.667
with that prospect.

08:00.750 --> 08:02.958
I won't lie.

08:03.042 --> 08:04.792
I'm gonna miss this place
when that time comes.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.083
It's going to take me a while

08:06.167 --> 08:08.333
to get used to living
on your world

08:08.417 --> 08:10.333
but we do need
a permanent headquarters

08:10.417 --> 08:12.625
for the Alliance,
and that's the logical choice.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.833
The bottom line is..

08:18.458 --> 08:20.125
...wherever you are..

08:20.208 --> 08:22.083
...is home enough for me.

08:22.167 --> 08:23.250
[giggles]

08:23.333 --> 08:26.375
[instrumental music]

08:41.708 --> 08:42.917
Captain.

08:44.417 --> 08:45.583
Mr. President.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.625
It's good to see you again.

08:47.708 --> 08:49.583
Thank you, sir.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.875
I assume you've received
my orders from Earthdome.

08:52.958 --> 08:55.708
I have. The orders
have been authenticated.

08:55.792 --> 08:57.250
Effective this date,
you have full

08:57.333 --> 09:00.250
and complete authority
in running Babylon 5.

09:00.333 --> 09:03.042
The station is under
your direct command.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.458
Welcome aboard.

09:04.542 --> 09:05.833
Thank you.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.042
Uh, please, be seated.

09:09.125 --> 09:11.458
Uh, do you have any questions
about the arrangement?

09:11.542 --> 09:15.208
Uh, yes, sir,
it's my understanding that

09:15.292 --> 09:17.458
Babylon 5 is to remain
an independent state

09:17.542 --> 09:19.125
pending decision by the Alliance

09:19.208 --> 09:20.542
to formally buy it from Earth.

09:20.625 --> 09:21.875
That's correct.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.250
Then why bring in
someone from Earthforce

09:23.333 --> 09:25.375
to run things?
Why not someone else?

09:26.875 --> 09:29.042
Tradition, for one thing.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.958
For another..

09:31.042 --> 09:32.500
...we're still trying
to heal the wounds

09:32.583 --> 09:34.542
from the civil war back home.

09:34.625 --> 09:37.167
'Putting someone from Earthforce
in charge of B-5'

09:37.250 --> 09:39.458
will help cement us
with the folks back there.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.042
Military and civilian.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.792
That's why I wanted
to make sure you got here

09:42.875 --> 09:46.917
before we started this
silly inauguration business.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.250
In a way, it's saying..

09:49.333 --> 09:51.083
...we're independent.

09:51.167 --> 09:53.458
But we'll always remember
where we came from.

09:55.458 --> 09:58.458
I hear you asked
for me in particular.

09:58.542 --> 09:59.792
Why?

10:01.333 --> 10:04.375
You have handled a number of
potentially dangerous missions

10:04.458 --> 10:06.500
without resorting to force.

10:06.583 --> 10:08.583
You're good with diplomacy
when possible

10:08.667 --> 10:11.250
but you know how to fight
when you have to.

10:11.333 --> 10:14.167
And you speak your mind.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.958
Now, whoever's running B-5
for the next year

10:17.042 --> 10:20.083
is going to be on the hot seat.

10:20.167 --> 10:22.000
I chose you strictly
on your background.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.375
You are the perfect choice.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.458
'Anything else?'

10:26.542 --> 10:28.125
Just one thing.

10:30.708 --> 10:32.500
Obviously, as head
of the Alliance

10:32.583 --> 10:34.917
you call the shots around here.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.292
But I can't be just
a mouthpiece for your decisions.

10:37.375 --> 10:40.167
I'll run this station
my way, or not at all.

10:40.250 --> 10:41.708
'If I'm to carry
the responsibility'

10:41.792 --> 10:43.625
I want the authority
to go with it.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.542
I won't be interfered
with or second-guessed

10:45.625 --> 10:47.250
or micro-managed..

10:48.333 --> 10:50.542
...sir.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.792
Like I said,
you speak your mind.

10:54.292 --> 10:55.583
'Fair enough, captain.'

10:55.667 --> 10:57.583
If it's a political decision

10:57.667 --> 10:59.583
or a decision on behalf
of the Alliance

10:59.667 --> 11:01.333
that's my turf.

11:01.417 --> 11:02.833
The rest is yours.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.500
Thank you.

11:05.583 --> 11:06.500
[beeps]

11:06.583 --> 11:08.125
Lochley. Go ahead.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.000
(Corwin)
'Captain, you'd better
get down to Bay 3.'

11:10.083 --> 11:11.625
'There's something here
you should see.'

11:11.708 --> 11:13.125
On my way.

11:13.208 --> 11:14.375
- I've got--
- I know. Believe me.

11:14.458 --> 11:15.792
I handled a few of those myself

11:15.875 --> 11:17.292
when I was captain here.

11:17.375 --> 11:19.125
We'll talk again later.

11:22.292 --> 11:24.333
Sir..

11:24.417 --> 11:27.250
...I noticed you didn't ask me
which side I was on

11:27.333 --> 11:29.417
during the big fight back home.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.417
You're right. I didn't.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.542
Good day, captain.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.708
(Garibaldi)
'So I don't want
anything to go wrong.'

11:48.792 --> 11:50.917
Now, you gotta seal off this
whole area through to Blue 5.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.792
It's the only way to make sure
that the rotunda is secure.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.292
Yeah, I know. I know.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.625
Last year we had one guy slip
through because the place wasn't

11:56.708 --> 11:58.625
sealed up right. You don't
want that to happen here.

11:58.708 --> 12:00.042
Now, you got diplomats
and ambassadors

12:00.125 --> 12:02.208
from half the old league
of non-aligned worlds here.

12:02.292 --> 12:03.958
- You can't--
- Afford to let that happen.

12:04.042 --> 12:06.292
Michael, will you please
let us handle this?

12:06.375 --> 12:07.583
Not a chance, Zack.

12:07.667 --> 12:08.958
I know this place
better than anybody

12:09.042 --> 12:10.542
and I'm determined that
nothing's gonna go wrong

12:10.625 --> 12:11.667
with Sheridan's inauguration.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.292
- I owe him that much.
- Okay.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.333
Alright, now,
the new Gaim ambassador

12:14.417 --> 12:15.833
make sure he has the right ID.

12:15.917 --> 12:16.958
- 'Check.'
- 'And whatever you do.'

12:17.042 --> 12:18.000
'Don't let him go on and on'

12:18.083 --> 12:20.292
'about those damn Gaim hive..'

12:21.708 --> 12:24.750
[intense music]

12:32.625 --> 12:34.292
We found him floating
outside the station.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.833
He's definitely a ranger.

12:35.917 --> 12:38.542
He was in a commercial stasis
bubble when we picked him up.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.375
But he didn't die
from exposure to space.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.167
- Let me see.
- You might not want to.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.208
I said, let me see.

12:49.042 --> 12:51.583
He had this around him
when he was found.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.583
[eerie music]

13:02.125 --> 13:04.042
[zapping]

13:10.458 --> 13:13.542
[intense music]

13:18.292 --> 13:20.833
[indistinct chatter]

13:48.333 --> 13:50.500
[chatter mutes]

13:58.625 --> 14:00.125
Hello.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.125
- I'm sorry, but I'm--
- 'Working.'

14:02.208 --> 14:03.583
Yes, I can see.

14:03.667 --> 14:08.083
Books, manuals,
directives regulations..

14:08.167 --> 14:11.208
The geometries that circumscribe
your waking life.

14:11.292 --> 14:12.667
Drawn narrower and narrower

14:12.750 --> 14:16.083
until nothing fits
inside them anymore.

14:16.167 --> 14:18.083
My name is Byron.

14:18.167 --> 14:21.333
It's important that you meet me
in Brown 3 in two hours.

14:21.417 --> 14:22.708
Come alone.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.750
Why should I do that?

14:24.833 --> 14:26.750
My people are coming.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.917
[indistinct chatter]

14:32.458 --> 14:35.000
[eerie music]

14:38.167 --> 14:39.333
[beeps]

14:40.875 --> 14:42.292
- Lochley. Go ahead.
- 'Captain Lochley.'

14:42.375 --> 14:43.875
'This is Dr. Franklin.'

14:43.958 --> 14:45.542
'I've finished the autopsy,
and I have the results'

14:45.625 --> 14:46.625
'you were waiting for.'

14:46.708 --> 14:48.208
On my way.

14:55.083 --> 14:56.958
[doorbell chimes]

14:58.458 --> 15:00.542
[chiming]

15:00.625 --> 15:02.500
Just a moment.

15:02.583 --> 15:03.875
Ah.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.958
[chiming]

15:09.667 --> 15:11.125
Yes?

15:13.333 --> 15:16.208
Ah, cap, uh..
That is, Mr. President.

15:16.292 --> 15:17.667
You're up late?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.875
You know, I'm not sure
I'll ever get used

15:19.958 --> 15:22.042
to being called Mr. President.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.500
I understand completely.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.583
Did I ever tell you
that I was not born

15:25.667 --> 15:27.000
with the name G'Kar?

15:27.083 --> 15:28.833
No, you didn't.

15:28.917 --> 15:30.583
It is tradition on my world

15:30.667 --> 15:33.333
to give newborn Narns
temporary names

15:33.417 --> 15:35.792
for the first ten years
of their lives.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.500
The practice came out
of the reality

15:37.583 --> 15:39.708
that life on Narn is very hard

15:39.792 --> 15:42.292
and in the past, many of us
died quite young.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.000
When we reach ten

15:44.083 --> 15:47.042
we choose which of our many
beliefs we want to follow.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.792
G'Quon, G'Lan, Na'Kili, others..

15:49.875 --> 15:52.292
And from that
we pick our true name.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.333
Well, perhaps the name
we call you now

15:54.417 --> 15:56.292
is your true name.

15:56.375 --> 16:00.042
So, Mr. President
...what can I do for you?

16:00.125 --> 16:03.000
Well, I was thinking about
that book you're writing.

16:03.083 --> 16:05.208
I've already heard
several of your people

16:05.292 --> 16:06.875
quoting it, and, uh..

16:06.958 --> 16:08.750
Well, Mr. Garibaldi
says it's very well written.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.542
Well, I-I'm sorry, there's just

16:10.625 --> 16:13.667
the one copy for now and, well..

16:13.750 --> 16:15.375
...when I loaned it
to Mr. Garibaldi

16:15.458 --> 16:17.833
it came back with
coffee stains. I can't--

16:17.917 --> 16:19.542
No, no, no. That's-that's
alright, that's alright.

16:19.625 --> 16:22.750
Don't worry.
It's not why I'm here.

16:22.833 --> 16:25.042
I was going over
the swearing-in ceremony

16:25.125 --> 16:26.250
that we've got coming up

16:26.333 --> 16:28.875
and there are two things
we still don't have.

16:28.958 --> 16:30.708
An oath of office..

16:30.792 --> 16:32.333
...and for lack of a better term

16:32.417 --> 16:36.042
a declaration of principles
for the New Alliance.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.458
Now, this kind of job
is going to require

16:37.542 --> 16:39.875
a very special kind of writing.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.708
Many times you have spoken

16:41.792 --> 16:44.208
with tremendous eloquence
in the council chambers.

16:44.292 --> 16:46.833
When your world fell
to the Centauri

16:46.917 --> 16:48.542
the words you spoke
made the hair

16:48.625 --> 16:51.083
on the back of my neck stand up.

16:51.167 --> 16:52.292
So..

16:53.500 --> 16:55.375
...I would like you
to write the oath

16:55.458 --> 16:57.375
and the declaration
of principles.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.750
Well, I'm flattered.

16:59.833 --> 17:03.042
Also terrified. Th-this
is a great responsibility.

17:03.125 --> 17:05.167
I know, but I can't
think of anyone

17:05.250 --> 17:06.708
more suited to the job.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.292
Well, then you shall have it!

17:08.375 --> 17:10.083
I shall dedicate myself
to nothing else

17:10.167 --> 17:11.667
from now until the inauguration.

17:11.750 --> 17:12.917
Well, thank you.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.208
I will not sleep,
eat, drink, nothing!

17:16.292 --> 17:18.667
The words and I will be
locked in mortal combat

17:18.750 --> 17:20.208
until one of us surrenders.

17:20.292 --> 17:22.000
- Well--
- Now go. Go on.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.625
I have to give myself
over to my muse. Goodbye.

17:24.708 --> 17:26.958
'I'll be in touch. Bye.'

17:37.042 --> 17:38.375
So, what killed him?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.958
Well, a single shot
from a PPG at close range

17:41.042 --> 17:42.292
directly to the heart.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.167
Superheated helium
tore through his ribcage

17:44.250 --> 17:45.333
incinerated most of his heart

17:45.417 --> 17:46.708
and fused
the 15th and 16th vertebrae.

17:46.792 --> 17:48.208
How long?

17:48.292 --> 17:50.583
Pending more tests, I'd have to
say less than a week.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.250
But Maint-Bot records indicate
that the body

17:52.333 --> 17:54.167
wasn't out in space, more than

17:54.250 --> 17:56.458
six or seven hours
before it was found.

17:56.542 --> 17:59.917
Meaning he was killed elsewhere
and then dumped outside.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.792
That's correct.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.625
So somebody wanted him
to be found here.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.125
The question is why.

18:06.208 --> 18:07.708
Unknown, but what I do know

18:07.792 --> 18:09.333
is that everything
I've seen here

18:09.417 --> 18:12.042
points to a disciplined,
careful, well-trained killer.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.583
Now, that PPG hit to the chest

18:13.667 --> 18:16.667
was in the exact spot
to cause instantaneous death.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.625
Whoever did this,
is very good at what he does.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.333
Do you think
this has anything to do

18:20.417 --> 18:22.458
with Sheridan's inauguration?

18:22.542 --> 18:24.375
I don't know. Maybe.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.417
[beeps]

18:25.500 --> 18:26.792
Go ahead.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.167
(Corwin)
'Captain, you said
you wanted me'

18:28.250 --> 18:29.542
'to remind you
about an appointment.'

18:29.625 --> 18:31.000
On my way. Uh, if you get

18:31.083 --> 18:32.500
any more information.
Be sure and let me know.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.542
I will. Uh-uh, hey, captain,
it's nice to meet you.

18:53.292 --> 18:54.625
Hello.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.375
[intense music]

18:59.458 --> 19:00.833
Thank you for coming.

19:00.917 --> 19:02.833
I came because your little
performance earlier

19:02.917 --> 19:05.292
was pretty clear indication
that you're a telepath.

19:05.375 --> 19:06.667
A strong one.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.375
Therefore potentially dangerous

19:08.458 --> 19:10.750
which is why
I didn't come alone.

19:16.042 --> 19:17.208
We are unarmed.

19:17.292 --> 19:19.542
And I assure you
we mean you no harm.

19:19.625 --> 19:20.708
We refuse to have
anything to do

19:20.792 --> 19:23.083
with violence or technology.

19:23.167 --> 19:26.375
Ours is a simple way,
as you will discover.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.583
- They're clean.
- Alright.

19:31.042 --> 19:32.417
So what do you want?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.833
A place to call home.

19:34.917 --> 19:37.167
My friends and I
are all telepaths.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.833
'More will come soon.'

19:38.917 --> 19:40.083
Rogues?

19:40.167 --> 19:43.250
We refused to join
the Psi Corps, yes.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.417
We tried working
through the resistance

19:45.500 --> 19:47.167
but their ways are not ours

19:47.250 --> 19:48.583
so we slipped away.

19:48.667 --> 19:52.417
Quietly, creating our
own lives on other worlds.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.833
Because, we can never go home.

19:53.917 --> 19:55.750
Our lives have been spent
in constant transit

19:55.833 --> 19:58.083
wandering from world to world.

19:58.167 --> 19:59.500
'We have come here.'

19:59.583 --> 20:02.500
Because an independent Babylon 5
may be the closest thing

20:02.583 --> 20:04.917
we will ever find to our home.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.125
We want to put out the word
to others of our kind

20:08.208 --> 20:10.542
have them gather here in safety.

20:10.625 --> 20:11.792
In time..

20:11.875 --> 20:13.792
...we will create
a small colony

20:13.875 --> 20:17.167
until one day, when we go out
to create a world of our own.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.875
A homeland..

20:18.958 --> 20:21.458
...for those who have
no other home.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.792
That's a tall order.

20:23.875 --> 20:25.583
Perhaps.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.625
But where is it written
that all our dreams

20:27.708 --> 20:29.208
must be small ones?

20:30.542 --> 20:32.250
Do you speak for all of them?

20:32.333 --> 20:36.083
These. And more yet to come.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.958
This is Sarah.

20:38.042 --> 20:40.333
Bright and beautiful.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.458
'The somber David.'

20:43.542 --> 20:44.958
'The last of his family'

20:45.042 --> 20:49.000
'the rest hunted down
and murdered by Psi Corps.'

20:49.083 --> 20:50.750
'William.'

20:50.833 --> 20:53.583
'Shy but really quite
interesting'

20:53.667 --> 20:56.000
'once you get to know him.'

20:56.083 --> 20:58.000
'Cynthia and Rosa.'

20:58.083 --> 20:59.833
'Closer than sisters.'

20:59.917 --> 21:01.375
And Simon.

21:01.458 --> 21:03.667
Special Simon, we call him.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.375
'Say hello, Simon.'

21:06.250 --> 21:08.792
[instrumental music]

21:18.792 --> 21:20.083
Flowers.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.125
I saw flowers.

21:24.208 --> 21:26.042
'Then he likes you.'

21:26.125 --> 21:27.292
'He only gives flowers
as a gift'

21:27.375 --> 21:29.583
'to the people he likes.'

21:29.667 --> 21:31.833
'He can remember everything
he's ever seen'

21:31.917 --> 21:33.417
heard, smelt, or touched

21:33.500 --> 21:35.417
from the moment he was born.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.792
And he can project
those memories

21:36.875 --> 21:39.042
into someone else's mind.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.208
Share a part of himself

21:40.292 --> 21:43.458
in the most intimate way
imaginable.

21:43.542 --> 21:45.667
I saw the flowers he gave you.

21:45.750 --> 21:47.583
I'd say he's quite fond of you.

21:50.292 --> 21:52.042
Thank you.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.375
(Byron)
'He doesn't talk.'

21:55.458 --> 21:57.167
Not even to us.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.375
Not even in here.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.250
He doesn't look well.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.042
'It's been a long trip.'

22:03.125 --> 22:04.542
Well, bring him to Medlab.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.792
He's a minor.
He should be checked out.

22:06.875 --> 22:08.875
Of course.

22:08.958 --> 22:11.375
We can do a lot
for you, captain.

22:11.458 --> 22:12.917
'We can earn our keep.'

22:13.000 --> 22:15.583
Work for you. Help you.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.417
All we need is a place to stay.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.708
A place to call home..

22:19.792 --> 22:21.250
...until we one day
can find a place

22:21.333 --> 22:23.250
to make our home.

22:26.375 --> 22:29.500
The queens thank you
for your help in this, Delenn.

22:29.583 --> 22:31.417
It's not a problem, Lesharr.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.750
The Gaim were a great help to us

22:32.833 --> 22:34.375
in our fight against the shadows

22:34.458 --> 22:37.375
and will continue to be strong
allies under the Alliance.

22:37.458 --> 22:39.625
If we can offer any
further help to your colonies

22:39.708 --> 22:41.125
please let us know.

22:41.208 --> 22:43.958
Thank you.
The queens be with you.

23:12.583 --> 23:15.625
[beeping]

23:18.542 --> 23:20.792
Computer, play waiting messages.

23:20.875 --> 23:23.708
(automated voice)
'Stand by.
Text message number one.'

23:23.792 --> 23:25.875
[intense music]

23:31.917 --> 23:33.958
'Voice message number two.'

23:35.708 --> 23:37.875
(male #5)
'Hello, Sheridan.'

23:37.958 --> 23:40.958
'I-I know that you're supposed
to be a big history buff.'

23:41.042 --> 23:43.500
'I know that you're a fan
of President Lincoln.'

23:43.583 --> 23:47.708
'Did you know that he was sure
that he would die in office?'

23:47.792 --> 23:49.750
'That as president,
he had to pay the price'

23:49.833 --> 23:52.167
'for the lives of all
the soldiers who died'

23:52.250 --> 23:55.000
'fighting his war?'

23:55.083 --> 23:57.250
'Some say that Roosevelt felt
that he would not make it'

23:57.333 --> 23:59.375
'out of office alive
with so many dead'

23:59.458 --> 24:02.000
'under his leadership.'

24:02.083 --> 24:03.208
'President Kyoshi'

24:03.292 --> 24:05.667
'of the Eastern Block,
50 years ago'

24:05.750 --> 24:07.417
'dying in office three days'

24:07.500 --> 24:09.958
'after the war
of the Shining Star ended.'

24:11.625 --> 24:13.542
'It is the job of a president'

24:13.625 --> 24:16.042
'to pay the price
for his people..'

24:17.667 --> 24:20.542
'...and his decisions.'

24:20.625 --> 24:23.250
Computer, what's the source
of these transmissions?

24:23.333 --> 24:27.583
(automated voice)
'Unknown. System records
altered. Unable to trace.'

24:27.667 --> 24:31.208
(male #5)
'You started the civil war
back home, Sheridan.'

24:31.292 --> 24:34.875
'The people who died
are your responsibility'

24:34.958 --> 24:37.000
and I'm here to make sure
you pay the price

24:37.083 --> 24:41.250
for your actions,
and to make sure you know why.

24:42.625 --> 24:44.208
You won't know
where it's coming

24:44.292 --> 24:48.833
or when.
But it's coming.

24:48.917 --> 24:51.542
And as strong
as you think you are..

24:51.625 --> 24:54.042
...the one thing you
can't stop is the lone gunman

24:54.125 --> 24:55.875
determined to kill you

24:55.958 --> 24:59.000
even if he gets killed
in the process.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.833
I'm that man, Sheridan.

25:06.917 --> 25:10.208
Maybe I'll go to hell
for that, but if I do

25:10.292 --> 25:12.250
I'm taking you
to hell with me.

25:12.333 --> 25:13.583
[beeps]

25:17.333 --> 25:19.667
(Dr. Franklin)
'He's slightly dehydrated.'

25:19.750 --> 25:22.333
'And malnourished
for some time now.'

25:22.417 --> 25:23.917
We are refugees, doctor.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.750
Eating out is not a luxury
we can afford.

25:26.833 --> 25:29.583
As you know.
You treated many of my kind.

25:29.667 --> 25:32.292
Vocal cords are intact
but atrophied.

25:33.708 --> 25:36.083
No apparent nerve damage,
so he can speak.

25:36.167 --> 25:39.292
He just chooses not to.
And why is that?

25:39.375 --> 25:41.583
Simon came to us
last year on Mars.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.417
He was a tunnel rat
living in the ducts

25:43.500 --> 25:45.875
and pipelines beneath Mars One.

25:45.958 --> 25:47.958
'We know he endured
some terrible trauma'

25:48.042 --> 25:50.167
'during those years.'

25:50.250 --> 25:51.708
We've never asked.

25:51.792 --> 25:54.167
When he chooses
to speak of it, he will.

25:54.250 --> 25:55.875
And if he doesn't?

25:55.958 --> 25:58.708
Then he alone will
bear the pain of it.

25:58.792 --> 26:00.333
But we are here for him

26:00.417 --> 26:02.667
if he should ever
change his mind.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.792
- I saw--
- 'Yes.'

26:09.875 --> 26:12.000
And that is all
he will let any of us see.

26:13.583 --> 26:16.125
We have no idea who she was.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.875
Only that he feels
guilt for her death

26:18.958 --> 26:20.958
and hopes to make up
for it someday.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.625
Alright, I'm going to, uh,
set up a series of treatments

26:26.708 --> 26:29.833
to get him back up to snuff.
Vitamins, hormone therapy.

26:29.917 --> 26:31.333
- 'We can afford little.'
- That's alright.

26:31.417 --> 26:32.875
We'll take care of it.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.542
- Then we can go?
- Yes, you can go. Franklin.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.125
(Lochley)
'Doctor, we're having
an emergency meeting'

26:37.208 --> 26:39.167
'in 20 minutes. Can you attend?'

26:39.250 --> 26:41.417
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Now, e..

26:54.083 --> 26:55.958
(Garibaldi)
'We can't go stumbling around
in the dark here.'

26:56.042 --> 26:57.667
We know there is a danger.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.208
I can't go along
with postponing the ceremony.

27:00.292 --> 27:02.167
Just for a few days until
we can bring in more security.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.500
Now, whoever this guy is

27:03.583 --> 27:05.333
we know he's killed
one person already.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.833
The message he sent you
was untraceable.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.333
That tells me he knows
our system inside and out.

27:09.417 --> 27:11.917
He's smart, he's deadly,
and he's after you.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.083
That's good enough for me.

27:14.167 --> 27:16.125
I refuse to go through life

27:16.208 --> 27:18.000
trapped inside of a bubble!

27:19.458 --> 27:21.042
With all due respect,
Mr. President

27:21.125 --> 27:24.542
you chose that life the moment
you accepted this position.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.375
On my world, we have learned

27:26.458 --> 27:29.208
an inauguration is simply
a signal to assassins

27:29.292 --> 27:30.833
that a new target
has been set up

27:30.917 --> 27:32.917
on the firing range.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.375
Uh, I-I am not going
to argue the point.

27:35.458 --> 27:38.208
But I am as much a target
today as I am tomorrow

27:38.292 --> 27:41.375
and the day after that,
and the day after that.

27:41.458 --> 27:43.792
'Now, I am supposed
to lead this Alliance'

27:43.875 --> 27:46.125
and for my money,
that means hands on.

27:46.208 --> 27:47.833
It means that
I should be out there

27:47.917 --> 27:50.125
where I can be seen,
where I can do some good.

27:50.208 --> 27:52.625
It's not the way
things are done!

27:54.542 --> 27:55.667
Well, then maybe it's time

27:55.750 --> 27:58.125
some of those things
were done differently.

27:59.708 --> 28:01.250
If more of our
so-called leaders

28:01.333 --> 28:02.750
would walk the same streets

28:02.833 --> 28:04.292
as the people
who voted them in

28:04.375 --> 28:06.542
live in the same buildings,
eat the same food

28:06.625 --> 28:08.750
instead of hiding
behind glass and steel

28:08.833 --> 28:10.250
and bodyguards.

28:10.333 --> 28:11.667
Maybe we'd get better leadership

28:11.750 --> 28:13.625
and a little more concern
for the future.

28:13.708 --> 28:15.417
John, that's a commendable idea

28:15.500 --> 28:17.208
but it's very dangerous.

28:17.292 --> 28:19.458
Is it?

28:19.542 --> 28:21.333
Our new friend just said

28:21.417 --> 28:23.500
all the security in the world

28:23.583 --> 28:25.208
can't stop a lone gunman

28:25.292 --> 28:27.917
dedicated to exchange
his life for the target

28:28.000 --> 28:29.917
and he is right.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.250
So you may as well live
instead of being a prisoner.

28:33.333 --> 28:34.917
I agree with Sheridan.

28:37.042 --> 28:38.417
How can you say that?

28:38.500 --> 28:41.958
[scoffs]
Because he's making
perfect sense.

28:42.042 --> 28:43.875
He's talking a political agenda.

28:43.958 --> 28:46.292
You're talking about
protecting your friend.

28:46.375 --> 28:47.542
Which is more important?

28:47.625 --> 28:49.625
They're the same thing.

28:49.708 --> 28:51.125
Are they?

28:52.708 --> 28:54.875
It's your vote and
mine, Mr. President.

28:54.958 --> 28:57.667
On behalf of Babylon 5
command and control

28:57.750 --> 28:59.958
I vote the ceremony
goes ahead on schedule.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.958
We can handle it.

29:02.042 --> 29:04.583
[intense music]

29:08.125 --> 29:09.792
I concur.

29:09.875 --> 29:11.333
(Lochley)
'Good. It's done.'

29:11.417 --> 29:13.417
I'll go tell Zack.

29:23.250 --> 29:24.542
Just a second.

29:24.625 --> 29:26.208
- I'm in rather a hurry.
- Tough.

29:26.292 --> 29:27.458
What the hell
was that all about?

29:27.542 --> 29:29.417
Excuse me, but by all rights

29:29.500 --> 29:31.458
you shouldn't even
have been in that meeting.

29:31.542 --> 29:33.000
You're not technically
head of security.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.375
You're a civilian.

29:34.458 --> 29:37.292
A consultant at best,
an annoyance at worst.

29:37.375 --> 29:38.500
Look, Sheridan's the kind of guy

29:38.583 --> 29:40.000
who looks for something
to challenge him.

29:40.083 --> 29:41.833
Sometimes, I think
he's a martyr in training.

29:41.917 --> 29:43.458
Great motives, lousy ending,
just in case

29:43.542 --> 29:44.958
you missed the whole
Joan Of Arc story.

29:45.042 --> 29:46.250
Now, in a situation like this

29:46.333 --> 29:48.375
we have to protect him
against himself.

29:48.458 --> 29:49.625
Really?

29:49.708 --> 29:51.250
Well, then perhaps
you should re-enlist

29:51.333 --> 29:53.500
to ensure his protection,
Mr. Garibaldi.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.625
'cause otherwise, your opinion
doesn't really count for much.

29:55.708 --> 29:57.958
Look, damn it, I was here
a hell of a long time

29:58.042 --> 29:59.542
before you ever showed up.

29:59.625 --> 30:02.208
Yes, you were,
and then you left.

30:02.292 --> 30:03.542
I really don't think
there's much more

30:03.625 --> 30:05.500
that needs saying, do you?

30:15.083 --> 30:18.125
[instrumental music]

30:34.083 --> 30:37.167
[intense music]

30:53.250 --> 30:55.333
(G'Kar)
Do you..

30:55.417 --> 30:57.625
..John J. Sheridan..

30:57.708 --> 30:59.458
Uhh!

30:59.542 --> 31:01.167
Uhh! Uh..

31:03.083 --> 31:04.083
[clunk]

31:04.167 --> 31:07.250
[instrumental music]

31:21.292 --> 31:24.333
[zapping]

31:25.917 --> 31:28.958

31:55.708 --> 31:56.958
[groans]

32:08.292 --> 32:10.875
[water gushing]

32:16.375 --> 32:18.833
I just finished writing the oath
of office this morning.

32:18.917 --> 32:21.500
I spent all night on it.
I-I hope you'll approve.

32:21.583 --> 32:24.125
I have every confidence
in your words, G'Kar.

32:26.750 --> 32:28.375
I thought we agreed

32:28.458 --> 32:30.792
on a discreet presence
by security.

32:30.875 --> 32:33.500
This is discreet,
at least far more discreet

32:33.583 --> 32:35.667
than Mr. Garibaldi
would have preferred.

32:35.750 --> 32:38.083
Having each guest strip-searched

32:38.167 --> 32:39.792
on his way in.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.167
I'm glad you
talked him out of it.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.208
I have no desire
to be struck blind

32:43.292 --> 32:45.125
by the sight of Londo naked.

32:45.208 --> 32:46.458
[chuckles]

32:49.667 --> 32:51.250
Anything new from Mr. Garibaldi?

32:51.333 --> 32:53.208
He's still analyzing
the voice mail

32:53.292 --> 32:54.375
from my computer system.

32:54.458 --> 32:56.458
With luck, he's got
something by now.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.417
(automated voice)
'Negative on voice match'

32:58.500 --> 33:01.125
'to human criminal
subjects on file.'

33:01.208 --> 33:02.875
Alright.
Then try the alien files.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.583
Maybe he just sounded human.

33:05.958 --> 33:07.458
(automated voice)
'Negative on voice match'

33:07.542 --> 33:10.583

Damn it.

33:19.917 --> 33:22.625
(man on recorder)
'I know that you're
a fan of President Lincoln..'

33:24.833 --> 33:27.083
'Some say that Roosevelt felt
he would not make it'

33:27.167 --> 33:28.583
'out of office alive..'

33:29.833 --> 33:31.833
'President Kyoshi
of the Eastern Block'

33:31.917 --> 33:34.083
'50 years ago, dying..'

33:37.083 --> 33:40.708
Roosevelt died
of natural causes.

33:40.792 --> 33:42.375
Lincoln and Kyoshi
were killed by soldiers

33:42.458 --> 33:45.333
who fought for the other side
in a civil war.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.792
Computer,
check voice pattern against

33:49.875 --> 33:52.250
current Earthforce
personnel on file.

[indistinct chatter]

34:08.708 --> 34:09.833
[beeping]

34:09.917 --> 34:11.000
Security. Go.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.208
Zack, I got it. Go private.

34:15.708 --> 34:18.000
His name's John Clemens
formerly Major Clemens.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.625
He ran the Beta 7
prison system

34:19.708 --> 34:21.125
under President Clark.

34:21.208 --> 34:24.083
When Clark was kicked out
of office, he went underground.

34:24.167 --> 34:25.708
Now, this guy's wanted
for the murder and torture

34:25.792 --> 34:27.333
of dissidents on Beta 7
and elsewhere.

34:27.417 --> 34:28.875
If he shows his face
anywhere in the Alliance

34:28.958 --> 34:30.167
he's a dead man.

34:30.250 --> 34:31.792
Yeah, which means
he's got nothing to lose

34:31.875 --> 34:33.083
and blames Sheridan.

34:33.167 --> 34:34.333
Exactly.

34:34.417 --> 34:35.917
Zack, this guy's
a trained infiltrator.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.958
He could be anywhere or anybody.

34:39.250 --> 34:40.958
Just get me a description,
will you?

34:41.042 --> 34:42.500
I'm workin' on it.

34:43.542 --> 34:46.125
[intense music]

34:47.292 --> 34:49.875
[indistinct chatter]

34:54.542 --> 34:56.000
Hold it.
You can't come in here.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.792
No, no, no.
Let him go. Let him go.

34:59.458 --> 35:00.500
Oh..

35:00.583 --> 35:02.042
[indistinct chatter]

35:09.875 --> 35:11.333
No!

35:20.125 --> 35:22.167
[intense music]

35:22.250 --> 35:23.917
There!

35:24.000 --> 35:25.167
Get down!

35:25.250 --> 35:27.208
[crowd screaming]

35:28.792 --> 35:31.292
Back off. Back off!
Or I'll kill her.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.708
[intense music]

35:38.875 --> 35:41.083
- Are you alright, dear?
- I'm fine.

35:41.167 --> 35:43.417
Zack, put out
an all-points bulletin.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.917
Already done.
He won't get very far.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.542
We sealed off
all the docking bays.

35:46.625 --> 35:48.542
His picture's gonna be all over
the station in a few minutes.

35:48.625 --> 35:51.708
I assume this will postpone
the rest of the ceremony.

35:51.792 --> 35:54.333
No. He had his chance,
and he blew it.

35:54.417 --> 35:56.208
He won't get this close again.

35:56.292 --> 35:58.250
We need to make sure
they all understand

35:58.333 --> 36:00.583
we will not be intimidated.

36:00.667 --> 36:02.375
We continue.

36:02.458 --> 36:05.708
(male announcer)
'Initiating station-wide
security check.'

36:05.792 --> 36:10.042
'All security personnel,
report to your unit commanders.'

36:10.125 --> 36:13.375
'A level-one APB
is in progress.'

36:13.458 --> 36:14.833
Come on.

36:21.708 --> 36:24.083
We'll get him. Don't worry.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.750
I mean, where the hell's
he gonna go?

36:35.667 --> 36:37.083
Unh!

36:39.667 --> 36:42.708
[eerie music]

36:48.333 --> 36:51.417
[indistinct chatter]

37:02.500 --> 37:04.458
[beeping]

37:05.125 --> 37:06.500
Oh, hell.

37:06.583 --> 37:09.625
[beeping]

37:12.500 --> 37:15.542
[intense music]

37:25.208 --> 37:27.458
Whoever speaks for the Alliance

37:27.542 --> 37:29.750
speaks with one voice for many.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.708
Consequently,
this contains the first page

37:33.792 --> 37:36.250
of every holy book of every race

37:36.333 --> 37:38.500
that has joined
the New Alliance.

37:40.375 --> 37:42.167
(G'kar over radio)
'Whoever speaks
for the Alliance'

37:42.250 --> 37:44.625
'does so
with the understanding'

37:44.708 --> 37:46.167
that it is the inalienable right

37:46.250 --> 37:50.542
of every sentient being
to live free.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.583
To pursue their dreams.

37:52.667 --> 37:54.875
To address wrongs
within their own society

37:54.958 --> 37:57.125
without fear of retribution.

37:57.208 --> 38:01.500
To believe as their conscience
requires in matters of faith.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.500
But also to respect
the rights of others

38:03.583 --> 38:05.917
to believe differently.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.375
Or not at all.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.250
Do you, John J. Sheridan..

38:11.333 --> 38:13.875
[dramatic music]

38:15.958 --> 38:17.792
(Clemens over radio)
'Everybody else can go.'

38:17.875 --> 38:19.042
'You have ten seconds.'

38:19.125 --> 38:21.625
[indistinct chatter]

38:21.708 --> 38:23.375
(male #6)
'Let's go! Let's go!'

38:27.292 --> 38:30.042
Fire at that range,
you're just as dead as I am.

38:30.125 --> 38:31.500
(Clemens)
'That's okay by me.'

38:32.375 --> 38:34.208
'You ruined my life.'

38:34.292 --> 38:36.292
My career.

38:36.375 --> 38:39.375
My family, and my world,
Sheridan.

38:39.458 --> 38:41.042
Time to pay the piper.

38:41.125 --> 38:42.583
And what will this accomplish?

38:42.667 --> 38:45.083
Even if you kill me,
the Alliance will go on.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.000
(Clemens)
'Maybe it will, maybe it won't.'

38:49.083 --> 38:52.250
'It doesn't matter much
to me either way.'

38:52.333 --> 38:53.917
'Just as long as you're dead.'

38:56.208 --> 38:57.833
Goodbye, Sheridan.

39:01.083 --> 39:02.917
(Garibaldi over radio)
C and C, I can't hold him.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.125
If this cockpit breeches,
I'm screwed.

39:05.208 --> 39:07.292
(Corwin)
'Assailant's ship is targeted.'

39:09.375 --> 39:10.417
Are we clear?

39:10.500 --> 39:12.708
(Corwin)
'All clear.'

39:12.792 --> 39:14.208
Here he comes.

39:16.250 --> 39:17.750
(Corwin)
'Fire at will.'

39:20.625 --> 39:22.042
[Clemens screams]

39:24.375 --> 39:26.917
[dramatic music]

39:32.500 --> 39:34.750
You want to be president?

39:34.833 --> 39:35.833
Yes.

39:35.917 --> 39:38.625
Put your hand on the book
and say, "I do."

39:38.708 --> 39:40.125
- I do.
- Fine. Done.

39:40.208 --> 39:41.625
Let's eat.

39:57.625 --> 40:00.292
- You're Mr. Byron?
- Just Byron.

40:02.875 --> 40:06.292
I saw what your friend did
on my behalf.

40:06.375 --> 40:08.042
I'm sorry for your loss.

40:10.292 --> 40:12.375
Now, Captain Lochley
informed me that..

40:12.458 --> 40:15.792
...you requested to start
a small colony here.

40:15.875 --> 40:18.083
I assume she's told you
her decision.

40:18.167 --> 40:20.167
She told us no.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.833
It's a word we've become
accustomed to.

40:22.917 --> 40:25.208
We'd hoped for something
better here.

40:25.292 --> 40:28.000
- We were wrong.
- Not entirely.

40:28.083 --> 40:31.125
See, our arrangement is that
I handle any political decisions

40:31.208 --> 40:34.042
that affect the Alliance
and Babylon 5.

40:34.125 --> 40:37.000
I'm putting this decision
in that category.

40:37.083 --> 40:39.750
You have my authority
to start a colony here.

40:39.833 --> 40:42.333
'And we'll set aside
part of Brown sector.'

40:42.417 --> 40:45.542
It's not much,
and it's not pretty.

40:45.625 --> 40:47.125
But it's a start.

40:48.292 --> 40:51.208
Thank you.
I will tell the others.

40:56.250 --> 40:59.500
I hope you made
the right decision.

40:59.583 --> 41:03.000
We both know a telepath war
is coming one of these days.

41:03.083 --> 41:04.875
It won't hurt to have
some of our own on hand

41:04.958 --> 41:06.167
when things get ugly.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.958
Besides, one of his people
saved my life.

41:09.042 --> 41:10.583
I owe them.

41:10.667 --> 41:12.292
I suppose so.

41:12.375 --> 41:14.417
So, how'd the meeting
with Garibaldi go?

41:14.500 --> 41:17.708
Fine. He said he'd notify
the captain ASAP.

41:18.625 --> 41:21.208
[instrumental music]

41:29.792 --> 41:32.167
Huh. It's a little crooked.

41:33.458 --> 41:34.500
Yes?

41:34.583 --> 41:36.708
Well, I just, uh,
wanted to stop by

41:36.792 --> 41:38.292
see how you're settling in.

41:38.375 --> 41:40.167
Just fine, thank you.

41:41.792 --> 41:43.417
So, what do you want?

41:43.500 --> 41:45.708
Uh...nothing.

41:45.792 --> 41:48.125
Nothing really.

41:48.208 --> 41:50.000
I just wanna let you know
I thought about

41:50.083 --> 41:52.292
what you said earlier
about re-enlisting and..

41:52.375 --> 41:53.750
Well, the bottom line
is I've never been

41:53.833 --> 41:56.583
big on uniforms
from the get-go and..

41:56.667 --> 41:58.083
...I've got someone on Mars
that needs me

41:58.167 --> 42:00.958
so I can't re-sign
with Babylon 5.

42:01.042 --> 42:02.292
Hmm, I understand, I--

42:02.375 --> 42:04.792
However, I talked
to the president earlier, and..

42:04.875 --> 42:08.375
You know, I like
the sound of that.

42:08.458 --> 42:10.625
"I talked to the president."

42:10.708 --> 42:11.833
Anyway, he agreed
we should set up

42:11.917 --> 42:13.375
a covert intelligence division

42:13.458 --> 42:14.667
mostly to be used to keep track

42:14.750 --> 42:15.833
of what everybody else is doing

42:15.917 --> 42:17.250
and, well, hell,
we might even need

42:17.333 --> 42:19.583
a little of our own
from time to time.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.042
But, uh, you know, granted

42:21.125 --> 42:24.250
military intelligence
is kind of an oxymoron

42:24.333 --> 42:26.583
but, uh, anyway, the new head

42:26.667 --> 42:29.833
of covert intelligence
for the Alliance..

42:29.917 --> 42:32.625
...is pleased to meet you.

42:32.708 --> 42:34.042
Now, we haven't decided
on a title yet.

42:34.125 --> 42:36.625
There's time for that.
So, uh, anyway, captain.

42:36.708 --> 42:40.667
I guess...I'll be seeing you
at the next meeting.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.583
- I guess so.
- Mmm-hmm.

42:42.667 --> 42:44.083
By the way, I finished
running the stats

42:44.167 --> 42:46.500
on our late, lamented assassin.

42:46.583 --> 42:49.208
I noticed you served with him
a few years back.

42:49.292 --> 42:50.958
Yes, I did.

42:51.042 --> 42:53.500
He was a good soldier,
a fine officer.

42:53.583 --> 42:56.875
But I guess...guess time
can change people.

42:58.917 --> 43:01.792
Yeah. I guess it can at that.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.417
By the way..

43:06.500 --> 43:08.667
Just curious.

43:08.750 --> 43:11.333
Which side were you on
during the big fight back home?

43:14.833 --> 43:18.375
I was on the side of Earth,
Mr. Garibaldi.

43:18.458 --> 43:20.625
Weren't we all?

43:20.708 --> 43:22.375
Hmm.

43:29.375 --> 43:31.292
[theme music]
