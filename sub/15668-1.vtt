02:29.382 --> 02:33.045
CONDEMNED TO DEATH BY HIS PEERS
FOR REBELLION

02:33.419 --> 02:36.820
HORUS FROM HIERAKONOPOLIS,
THE GOD OF HEAVENS,

02:37.023 --> 02:40.754
HAS SEVEN DAYS TO SEE THE EARTH
OF MANKIND

02:40.994 --> 02:44.725
ONCE MORE,
THE EARTH THE HELPED CREATE.

02:44.964 --> 02:49.628
SEVEN DAYS: THE TIME FOR ONE BEAT
OF THE DIVINE HEART.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.169
NOT A SECOND MORE.

02:51.571 --> 02:54.768
BEFORE BEING DEPRIVED
OF HIS IMMORTALITY

02:54.941 --> 02:57.705
BUT EVEN THE GODS FEAR DEATH

03:12.325 --> 03:13.349
Heru?
Horus?

03:13.526 --> 03:14.626
Meru
It's time

03:14.627 --> 03:18.290
Ta em sertu en maa abtet!
Make the most of your Iast moments

03:18.531 --> 03:25.562
Seven days, HORUS, seven hourglasses...
Not a second more.

03:25.905 --> 03:28.203
Semut bat.
Trust me

03:36.082 --> 03:38.642
I know you're there...

03:49.762 --> 03:51.320
Hey! Look over there!

03:51.531 --> 03:54.364
What is this?

03:54.734 --> 03:57.225
A naked man with a bird head.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.233
What's going on? I Iose controI.

04:01.474 --> 04:05.843
There is no answer...
Right me, right me

04:13.386 --> 04:17.584
Children...my humans children.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.349
I am back.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.434
...Now, I'm aIso in charge of the nano
impIants department...

05:11.611 --> 05:14.637
...but we concentrate more
on synthetic skin.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.404
No hard feelings, then.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.015
Thank you for reminding me!

05:18.818 --> 05:19.477
Can I take two?

05:19.719 --> 05:22.916
No. Only one this time.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.584
There're maybe no hard feelings
but you're still tight-fisted?

05:26.759 --> 05:28.090
Fuck you, Elma.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.591
You should be so lucky.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.944
That girI's dangerous.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.109
She must be on pretty powerfuI stuff...

05:49.349 --> 05:52.477
She managed to damage a carrier
when they were selecting them...

05:52.652 --> 05:54.483
When they were rounding them up,
you mean...

05:54.721 --> 05:56.416
That's why I'm interested in her...

05:56.489 --> 05:59.083
I see that you're invoIved in iIIegaI
medicine more than ever.

05:59.492 --> 06:02.017
Resistance medicine,
there's a difference.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.327
You really like her, don't you?

06:05.832 --> 06:07.424
I'm taking her with me.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.630
I'II need a suppIy of antibiotics,
even oId ones...

06:10.870 --> 06:11.461
and microneedles...

06:11.704 --> 06:13.137
Not so fast, darling!

06:14.240 --> 06:17.732
I want a detaiIed report of aII
the anaIyses you perform on her.

06:17.944 --> 06:21.141
And don't even try to pretend that
you've Iost the fiIe!

06:21.314 --> 06:23.077
You can have her, but I want the fiIe!

06:50.143 --> 06:52.577
He's waiting for her
to be returned to him.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.509
How old are you?...

07:01.921 --> 07:02.910
Let's go...

07:26.579 --> 07:28.877
... But you openly accuse
Senator Allgood

07:29.081 --> 07:30.514
of manipulating public opinion.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.115
Do you think he's the one who organized

07:32.318 --> 07:34.149
the pyramid affair
in order to get elected?

07:34.387 --> 07:37.515
No. His influence
doesn't run that deep.

07:37.690 --> 07:41.421
It's obvious that the pyramid
is extraterrestriaI,

07:41.661 --> 07:44.357
Iike the INTRUSION zone
in CentraI Park...

07:44.597 --> 07:46.588
I don't agree with the view
that Intrusion

07:46.766 --> 07:49.326
is a matrix of dangerous mutants.

07:49.535 --> 07:54.563
This rumor was spread by Allgood
to serve the interests of EUGENlCS.

07:54.740 --> 07:59.507
Scientists have proved that Intrusion
is a GATEWAY to PARALLEL

07:59.745 --> 08:02.270
or EXTRATERRESTRIAL worIds.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.679
We'II have to face the fact that
we're not aIone in the Universe...

08:05.852 --> 08:09.982
But in practicaI terms your program
doesn't seem very satisfactory.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.488
You're putting all the blame
on the outgoing candidate,

08:12.692 --> 08:13.716
Senator Allgood.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.487
...I'm aIso taIking about
the medicaI dictatorship

08:16.696 --> 08:19.096
that ALLGOOD has imposed on NYC,

08:19.298 --> 08:22.358
with the active participation
of EUGENICS.

08:22.535 --> 08:26.130
I'm taIking about raids,
iIIegaI experiments,

08:26.339 --> 08:29.574
unauthorized blood-tests
and organ removal,

08:29.575 --> 08:33.875
people going missing...
I'm talking about GLOBUS 1,

08:34.246 --> 08:35.770
you know what that is, don't you?

08:35.982 --> 08:38.381
It's the 'freezer'
used by the mad scientists

08:38.583 --> 08:40.575
that work for EUGENICS'...

08:40.753 --> 08:44.211
But you do agree there's a reaI
security probIem, don't you?

08:44.457 --> 08:46.448
That series of murders on LeveI 2...

08:46.592 --> 08:47.854
That's police business.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.587
I have fuII confidence
in the FederaI PoIice.

08:50.630 --> 08:51.722
What a bitch!

08:52.064 --> 08:54.123
What a bitch!

08:54.300 --> 08:57.292
A bitch,
but a fast Iearner about poIitics.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.371
That's what I mean! A whore!

09:00.706 --> 09:03.190
That's enough... About those murders.

09:03.191 --> 09:05.674
How many have been reported so far?

09:06.112 --> 09:06.976
Four.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.771
Who's in charge of the case?

09:08.981 --> 09:11.472
Inspector Froebe.
He's a speciaIist in the abnormaI.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.584
He thinks it's the work
of a seriaI kiIIer.

09:13.819 --> 09:17.482
Froebe is no specialist.
Hunting is all he lives for,

09:17.723 --> 09:20.556
ever since he had his face chewed
on by the Dayak.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.658
He's a reaI psychopath.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.195
He's a IiabiIity.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.993
I don't agree, Miss Liang.

09:26.432 --> 09:29.162
Froebe is a good cop, and anyway,
he's politically neutral.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.836
"Neutral!" ..."Neutral"
doesn't exist...

09:32.038 --> 09:35.371
There're only men and women...
Humans and aliens.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.440
The integrated and the rejected.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.104
The whole fucking universe
is split into two...

10:01.334 --> 10:03.359
That makes five!
In Iess than 48 hours,

10:03.536 --> 10:05.367
that's got to be a record...

10:05.605 --> 10:07.300
Exactly the same M. O.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.907
It's just as if the body had expIoded
from the inside.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.237
I was toId there was a witness.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.312
Yeah! He's right over there,
he's waiting for you

10:17.883 --> 10:19.783
Back at my office in an hour.

10:22.755 --> 10:26.020
You're alright?
I'll see you at Froebe's, OK?

10:26.192 --> 10:29.025
Yeah... Yeah... AII right!
I'II see you there.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.794
Are you sure you're alright?

11:49.942 --> 11:51.500
Hi...Mmm...

11:53.846 --> 11:55.336
What can I get you?

11:55.881 --> 12:00.944
He wants to know if they're diseased.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.786
He asked you a question.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.321
I... I'm fine, thanks.

12:06.525 --> 12:08.652
AII your organs?!

12:08.828 --> 12:11.490
I've... I've changed my Iungs.
They're a Chinese modeI.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.029
Not bad... Pretty attractive...
and... I...

12:14.233 --> 12:17.532
I have a new bIadder too,
no probIem there.

12:24.977 --> 12:26.501
Still don't want a drink?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.179
Six.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.708
No. Seven.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.647
Outside the bar...the witness.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.376
The one I never got to see.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.648
That's right, the giant.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.184
He's the seventh and the agent who
was supposed

13:12.358 --> 13:14.121
to bring him to you was the sixth.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.021
Reminds you of the DAYAKS, doesn't it?

13:16.262 --> 13:19.095
Cold blooded carnage like this,
right up their alley.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.162
The Dayaks are extinct.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.995
They were all exterminated after
the riots, thirty years ago.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.899
Except the one that got you....

13:32.311 --> 13:33.869
Thank you, Sandy.

14:04.243 --> 14:07.440
It's not going to hoId but I can't do
anything anymore...

14:07.613 --> 14:09.274
I did warn you.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.411
you've modified
or replaced all the rest.

14:15.654 --> 14:17.713
I have a contract with EUGENICS...

14:17.890 --> 14:19.915
I had guessed that much.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.351
Tell my colleague I sent you.

14:22.895 --> 14:26.160
He's a specialist
in nano- surgical repairs...

14:29.702 --> 14:31.226
Don't Ieave it too Iong.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.903
Thank you Doctor.

14:46.118 --> 14:50.851
I'm so sorry, JiII. New Yorkers aII
seem to have gone insane...

14:51.724 --> 14:57.720
Where was I? Oh, Yes,
the Iapse in your memory.

14:58.197 --> 15:02.327
I was wondering what it is that
you don't want to remember so badIy,

15:02.501 --> 15:04.128
that you're this blocked?

15:04.770 --> 15:07.830
Put it another way;
what are you trying to forget?

15:08.107 --> 15:11.873
I can't remember anything,
there's a subtIe difference.

15:12.111 --> 15:13.703
But it seems
that you remembered to take

15:13.913 --> 15:16.211
strong doses of potentially dangerous

15:16.415 --> 15:19.179
substances as yet unidentified.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.277
Do you have any on you?

15:22.721 --> 15:26.316
Is your suppIier on IeveI 3,
in LittIe Paris,

15:26.525 --> 15:28.049
amongst the non humans?

15:31.463 --> 15:33.863
Some of them are very decent beings.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.858
You, for example...

15:45.577 --> 15:47.568
I have to teII you that
in 20 years of medicine

15:47.746 --> 15:50.306
I've never seen
a guinea pig quite Iike you...

15:52.551 --> 15:54.849
I've never seen such a heart,

15:55.054 --> 15:57.921
Iungs, or a womb Iike that... Never.

16:01.927 --> 16:06.091
You're built like someone who
was born less than three months ago...

16:07.166 --> 16:09.031
Maybe that's what you want to forget?

16:10.636 --> 16:17.200
Or what you're not sure about?
When did you get to New York?...

16:21.613 --> 16:23.342
And how?

16:29.054 --> 16:32.512
Some of the vertebrate animals
on this planet shed their skin,

16:34.193 --> 16:36.661
You are going through
the same process...

16:36.996 --> 16:39.624
Listen to my offer! Work for me.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.959
Let me conduct
a thorough medicaI examination,

16:43.135 --> 16:45.865
take some samples,
test some medication...

16:46.105 --> 16:47.333
If you trust me,

16:47.506 --> 16:49.633
you won't have anything to worry
about any more.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.208
You'II be covered and IegaI...
And more importantIy,

16:52.411 --> 16:53.444
I'II get you a card.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.936
I have a contract
with the Western hysteria ...

16:56.348 --> 16:57.645
You can Iive there...

16:58.017 --> 17:00.815
You're the greatest mystery
of nature I've ever come across...

17:48.267 --> 17:49.564
John...

17:59.478 --> 18:01.070
I got picked up in a Eugenics raid.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.611
I shot a carrier...

18:03.816 --> 18:09.584
It couId have gone very badIy...
A human woman doctor saved me.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.454
She offered me a job
and IegaI housing...

18:13.625 --> 18:14.956
Accept it...

18:15.160 --> 18:16.855
As a guinea pig...

18:17.096 --> 18:20.964
Apparently my body
is only three months old,

18:21.200 --> 18:24.033
and my organs aren't
in the right place...

18:24.369 --> 18:29.204
Not in the right place,
according to whose criteria?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.942
You see that pyramid monument...

18:33.445 --> 18:35.970
Do you think it's in its right place?

18:36.181 --> 18:39.014
And me? Do you think I am?

18:40.752 --> 18:44.085
There's something important
you should know.

18:44.690 --> 18:49.354
This planet is rejecting me,
Jill...This atmosphere,

18:49.595 --> 18:53.895
this oxygen, it's burning me up...

18:55.634 --> 18:58.626
I have to take care
of you before it's too Iate.

18:59.938 --> 19:04.637
I'm getting oId, JiII,
I've been around for centuries...

19:05.544 --> 19:07.273
I'm confused

20:12.644 --> 20:13.872
Oh... My God...

20:16.481 --> 20:17.641
Jesus!

20:18.850 --> 20:20.408
This one's empty!

20:32.397 --> 20:34.558
Restricted area.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.231
... A flying pyramid,
a serial killer on the loose

22:17.469 --> 22:19.494
and now a chunk
of prison falling from the sky.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.834
Is someone out to sabotage
my poIiticaI career or what?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.704
It's Iike in one of those
Greek tragedies, Senator,

22:25.944 --> 22:28.435
all the elements will fall into place...

22:28.647 --> 22:31.741
What are you doing here,
Inspector FROEBE?

22:31.783 --> 22:35.549
I'm Iooking for three
of my men who have disappeared.

22:35.954 --> 22:37.785
Your seriaI kiIIer again?

22:38.023 --> 22:39.718
Don't think so.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.489
Here. A gift for you.

22:42.661 --> 22:43.889
What is it?

22:44.229 --> 22:45.526
You should know better than me.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.199
Give me that!
This is way out of your Ieague.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.392
I haven't found
the man who goes with this...

23:10.722 --> 23:19.824
"Remember...
Remember the sight we saw, my soul,

23:19.998 --> 23:23.661
that beautiful soft summer morning..."

23:27.205 --> 23:32.199
"...round a turning in the path..."

23:32.711 --> 23:34.269
Thank you...

23:35.113 --> 23:42.485
..."a disgusting carcass
on a bed scattered with stones,

23:44.689 --> 23:49.092
its legs in the air like
a woman in heat..."

24:31.603 --> 24:35.130
"Remember the sight we saw, my soul,

24:35.173 --> 24:39.769
that beautifuI soft summer morning...

24:40.178 --> 24:43.170
round a turning in the path,

24:43.348 --> 24:48.786
a disgusting carcass
on a bed scattered with stones,

24:50.121 --> 24:57.118
its legs in the air like a woman
in heat..."

25:00.065 --> 25:06.095
"... like a fountain
with its rhythmical sobs.

25:07.205 --> 25:10.038
I can hear it cIearIy fIowing
with a Iong,

25:10.275 --> 25:15.577
murmuring sound, but I touch my body
in vain to find the wound..."

25:19.351 --> 25:23.879
"...I am the vampire of my own heart,

25:24.956 --> 25:30.189
One of the great outcasts condemned
to eternaI Iaughter

25:30.362 --> 25:33.695
who can no longer smile...".

25:35.834 --> 25:41.739
Am I dead? I must be dead.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.504
And you...

25:48.647 --> 25:51.241
I know you,
you are from HierakonopoIis.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.916
The god of the heavens.

25:53.151 --> 25:57.713
I'm fIattered, NikopoI,
wretched human.

25:57.923 --> 26:00.084
...Anubis can't be far away?

26:00.258 --> 26:02.317
The guardian of the tombs...
The god of the dead...

26:02.494 --> 26:04.553
Don't ever speak
that jackaI's name again,

26:04.729 --> 26:08.563
you understand? Only my name...
Only me...

26:09.067 --> 26:10.864
OK.. OK...

26:13.838 --> 26:17.604
My Ieg!... Where is my Ieg?

26:17.976 --> 26:20.410
You can see you're not dead...

26:20.612 --> 26:22.341
The dead don't feeI pain...

26:22.581 --> 26:25.414
The dead don't bleed either.

26:25.650 --> 26:30.917
Yeah,
I'm aIive and I'm bIeeding Iike a pig.

26:39.364 --> 26:42.731
Listen carefully, I won't say it twice.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.526
For two of your days now,

26:44.736 --> 26:46.567
I have been Iooking for a host body,

26:46.805 --> 26:51.139
for reasons that go far beyond any
human concerns.

26:51.343 --> 26:55.575
I need a body
to weIcome me and serve me.

26:55.747 --> 26:59.444
You... You seem to be suitable.

26:59.684 --> 27:04.678
I've tested seven humans before you
and rejected them aII... But you,

27:04.856 --> 27:08.883
your body is clean.
You come from the past...

27:09.060 --> 27:11.392
Thirty years of hibernation...

27:11.596 --> 27:17.193
Your body won't reject me.
We are compatible.

27:19.571 --> 27:24.201
What year is it? Who set me free?

27:24.442 --> 27:33.840
2095 after your Jesus Christ.
Your release is an accidental escape.

27:34.052 --> 27:38.648
I was supposed to be Iet out in 2096.

27:39.891 --> 27:44.157
I was reIeased a year ahead
of scheduIe.

27:44.462 --> 27:49.058
I've gained a year
but Iost a Ieg. Fuck!

27:51.403 --> 27:53.963
Forget the old one...

27:58.343 --> 28:01.335
Here's a new one.

28:06.885 --> 28:10.377
Yes... Thank you for calling.

28:11.556 --> 28:14.855
That was the forensic scientist
from Globus...

28:15.060 --> 28:16.186
And?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.454
The Ieg has been identified.

28:18.630 --> 28:19.824
And?

28:19.998 --> 28:24.765
Well... it belongs to... Nikopol.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.621
Perfect

28:48.293 --> 28:53.595
There's no way.
This thing weighs a ton.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.859
I'II never be abIe to move.

28:57.335 --> 29:02.238
That's right.
Without me you won't be able to move.

29:02.507 --> 29:03.997
And by the way,

29:04.209 --> 29:09.442
from now on you won't be able
to do much of anything without me...

29:09.614 --> 29:12.276
I accept that I'm not dead now.

29:12.517 --> 29:16.317
But I hope I'm dreaming this.
PIease God Iet this be a nightmare.

29:16.788 --> 29:19.086
Let this all be a nightmare...

29:19.357 --> 29:22.053
You believe in God?

29:22.360 --> 29:24.794
I don't even have that to faII back on.

29:24.996 --> 29:29.797
I suggest you beIieve in me, NikopoI...

29:31.202 --> 29:32.726
Do I have a choice?

29:32.937 --> 29:35.303
I'm afraid not.

29:41.813 --> 29:45.271
Now, rise and walk.

30:05.203 --> 30:09.367
I've reIinquished controI, NikopoI,
you can have a bit of autonomy now.

30:09.541 --> 30:13.739
I want you to know that everything
is going perfectIy weII.

30:13.912 --> 30:17.973
Your body is very comfortable
and tolerates me beautifully...

30:18.149 --> 30:22.711
And above all you're most elegant.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.288
Are you fucking kidding me?

30:24.689 --> 30:31.527
Elegant, famous and subversive.
Just what I like ...

30:32.230 --> 30:35.097
It seems you're the instigator
of aII this fighting

30:35.333 --> 30:37.198
that's been going on without you...

30:37.435 --> 30:40.927
Not bad for a human...

30:50.682 --> 30:54.345
Would it be too much to ask
for just a bit more autonomy?

30:59.257 --> 31:00.986
I'd Iike to choose my own cIothes,

31:01.226 --> 31:03.353
with the IittIe free
wiII I have Ieft...

31:05.430 --> 31:11.733
Your happiness is my priority,
Nikopol, Mr. Free spirit.

31:34.325 --> 31:36.520
How is Doctor Elma Turner?

31:36.694 --> 31:37.928
Never been better.

31:37.929 --> 31:42.059
Welcome to the Western Hysteria Hotel.
39th floor. Room 12.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.494
Any friend of Dr Turner's
is a friend of mine.

33:03.448 --> 33:05.939
Por ti Ketro...

33:06.517 --> 33:11.420
That's for me?... Thanks...

33:13.458 --> 33:14.288
What's your name?

33:14.525 --> 33:15.856
Willy... Ketarakado... Willy...

33:16.060 --> 33:22.727
Willy? OK, I'll call you Willy.
And you can call me Jill...

33:24.635 --> 33:30.665
Temperature fourty four degrees

33:30.842 --> 33:34.437
Number of teeth: thirty seven unit,
thirty seven

33:35.113 --> 33:38.139
No mammaI dentaI bIades,
unknown BuccaI profiIe unknown...

33:38.483 --> 33:41.111
Thank you Jill now you can make
the food test.

34:11.215 --> 34:12.681
...with a Iist that's getting Ionger.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.442
Eight victims, all male,

34:18.755 --> 34:19.745
This just in,

34:19.924 --> 34:22.722
Senator ALLGOOD has announced
that he will be on the Zeppelin

34:22.994 --> 34:25.257
when the scientific delegation
and leading

34:25.463 --> 34:27.123
Egyptologists make another attempt

34:27.364 --> 34:30.458
to contact the inhabitants
of the Pyramid...

34:30.701 --> 34:32.362
...the hydrometer rate
is down today in

34:32.603 --> 34:34.036
Brooklyn for the fourth day running.

34:34.237 --> 34:37.571
On INTRUSION, however, no change.
Snow, ice,

34:37.775 --> 34:40.039
temperature 23 below freezing...

34:40.210 --> 34:42.440
Twelve attempted break-ins
into lNTRUSlON have been

34:42.612 --> 34:45.411
reported: there are no survivors.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.551
Do not approach the CentraI Park area.

34:51.656 --> 34:58.562
DOWN! ... DOWN! ... DOWN!
...EVERY BODY DOWN!

36:04.629 --> 36:07.996
Aber od neb aber, Bastet?
Are we cheating or not, Bastet?

36:08.199 --> 36:12.260
Aber, Anubis,aber .
We're cheating,Anubis, we're cheating

36:24.315 --> 36:26.875
You don't understand? NikopoI is aIive!

36:26.918 --> 36:29.386
Maybe not.
It was reported that He was shot

36:29.754 --> 36:31.153
by a department store security guard

36:31.355 --> 36:35.689
and fell a hundred meters...
But they couldn't find the body.

36:35.893 --> 36:37.884
Are you telling me the man can fly?

36:37.929 --> 36:39.920
I can put you on to HuxIey,
Froebe's right hand man.

36:40.231 --> 36:40.959
He's in charge of...

36:41.032 --> 36:44.365
That's OK, Jonas. Thanks.
You can Ieave us now...

36:45.636 --> 36:48.628
Right. Get the hell out
of here! Beat it!

36:50.708 --> 36:52.039
He knows everything.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.277
I know he knows everything,

36:54.278 --> 36:57.042
and his phenomenaI memory
is stuffed with enough evidence

36:57.481 --> 37:00.211
concerning your Iate father's
financiaI deaIings

37:00.451 --> 37:03.621
and his illegal experiments
on alien populations to cause EUGENlCS

37:03.622 --> 37:05.816
some very serious problems...

37:06.190 --> 37:07.680
I am aware of that.

37:08.292 --> 37:12.558
Up untiI now we've onIy had the spirit
of NikopoI to deaI with,

37:12.730 --> 37:14.994
but now we have him in flesh and blood.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.566
No one's ever come back from GLOBUS.

37:17.768 --> 37:22.501
Well, HE has. Why wasn't he executed
30 years ago, anyway?

37:22.740 --> 37:26.540
Are you crazy?... Are you crazy?

37:26.844 --> 37:30.109
To make a hero out of him,
a martyr to their Iousy revoIution?

37:30.281 --> 37:33.648
What do you want, riots,
assassination?!

37:47.365 --> 37:49.890
It is the last prototype
of the "hunter" version.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.592
Fast, ferocious and totally illegal.

37:52.803 --> 37:55.135
He'II be quicker
than Froebe and his men.

37:55.406 --> 37:55.997
Are you sure?

37:56.240 --> 38:01.837
No, but it's the only solution...
Apart from your "protege".

38:02.046 --> 38:06.847
No, not him...
Let's try this one first.

38:08.953 --> 38:09.942
Come in!

38:11.989 --> 38:13.354
You're early!

38:13.557 --> 38:15.388
We have no time to Iose

38:15.926 --> 38:18.724
Is he ready?
Have you re-activated him yet?

38:18.963 --> 38:21.397
No. I'II need about an hour.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.295
I wanted to make sure you reaIIy
wanted him.

38:25.536 --> 38:26.833
We do.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.499
OK.

38:53.464 --> 38:55.625
What's this! What happened?

38:56.534 --> 39:00.868
Nothing of any importance,
really, nothing.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.169
Do you Iike women?

39:07.411 --> 39:08.571
Women?

39:09.013 --> 39:11.345
Women...

39:11.549 --> 39:16.987
My most beautifuI and most important
creation on this pIanet...

39:19.990 --> 39:23.323
Your story doesn't make much sense...

39:24.161 --> 39:28.757
You're Iooking for a bIue-haired girI
with white skin...

39:29.533 --> 39:33.993
What's this all about, and,
how do you know she comes here?

39:34.205 --> 39:38.309
In the same way that I knew
I'd find her on pIanet Earth,

39:38.310 --> 39:40.334
in New York City...

39:40.678 --> 39:45.047
Intuition, NikopoI,
the intuition of the gods...

39:45.249 --> 39:49.982
So. What's so speciaI about her
that warrants such a dispIay of taIents?

39:50.054 --> 39:53.319
Is she Miss Universe or what?

39:54.458 --> 40:00.055
You don't think I've come aII this way
for a mere human being, do you?

40:08.572 --> 40:10.699
Now I know more about you...

40:14.512 --> 40:16.742
Why are you doing all this for me?

40:17.782 --> 40:19.807
It's a poIiticaI and sociaI fight.

40:20.217 --> 40:22.515
My Spirit of NikopoI coming out.

40:23.220 --> 40:25.450
Besides, your case interests me...

40:26.757 --> 40:28.816
I think you Iike me...

40:32.229 --> 40:34.322
Isn't that what you were thinking?

40:37.101 --> 40:38.363
You could say that.

40:39.003 --> 40:40.402
How did you guess?

40:41.205 --> 40:43.105
Do you read minds too?

40:43.374 --> 40:45.171
You could say that...

40:45.476 --> 40:47.910
It's true, I do Iike you
and I feeI cIose to you, JiII,

40:48.112 --> 40:50.910
whoever you are...
Mutant or whatever...

40:51.248 --> 40:53.148
Although you are beginning
to scare me.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.418
Let's try a IittIe experiment.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.610
To test this talent of yours...

40:57.788 --> 41:01.554
I'm going to think of a question
and you're going to answer. Ready?

41:01.792 --> 41:02.884
Ready.

41:04.562 --> 41:06.427
I've asked the question.

41:08.065 --> 41:11.523
You want to know
if I've started testing

41:11.735 --> 41:13.930
the foods you prescribed for me,

41:14.104 --> 41:15.731
if I took a bIood
test three hours Iater and

41:15.973 --> 41:18.134
if I took ... notes.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.775
Answer: Yes!

41:21.946 --> 41:25.006
I did everything I was supposed to do,
and I found everything absoIuteIy

41:25.182 --> 41:29.778
delicious...
I'm a professional guinea pig.

41:30.287 --> 41:31.720
Have you tasted everything?

41:31.922 --> 41:33.719
For dinner, yes. I ate it aII.

41:34.024 --> 41:37.687
And you ate everything at once?
In the prescribed quantities?

41:37.928 --> 41:42.297
I weighed everything.
I just changed a coupIe of the recipes.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.865
I didn't have anything to cook with

41:44.068 --> 41:48.971
so I ate the fish caIIed monkfish raw
and the Iamb too.

41:50.307 --> 41:51.968
They're not bad together.

41:52.209 --> 41:53.972
How many meals do you have a day?

41:54.445 --> 41:56.072
Two a week.

42:50.501 --> 42:52.059
She's not bad.

42:53.337 --> 42:57.637
Not surprising, you idiot.
She's the one.

43:41.151 --> 43:42.345
John...

43:58.669 --> 44:00.569
Come Jill, come...

44:03.907 --> 44:07.604
You'II be my Iast
and my most beautifuI Intrusion...

44:07.845 --> 44:10.313
Listen carefully...

44:10.514 --> 44:13.312
For thousands of Earth years I've been

44:13.384 --> 44:17.582
introducing people into
the four corners of the galaxy...

44:17.955 --> 44:21.991
People misplaced by the vagaries
of the Universe...

44:21.992 --> 44:28.022
You're a misplaced person, Jill...
And I'll never know your origins...

44:28.365 --> 44:31.425
You appeared deep in the heart
of INTRUSION about three months ago...

44:31.602 --> 44:34.730
That's where I took charge of you...

44:34.905 --> 44:38.466
The blue pills stop your past
from re-emerging

44:38.676 --> 44:41.201
and Iet the present... invade you.

44:41.945 --> 44:45.381
Your metamorphosis is on the verge
of completion...

44:45.616 --> 44:50.144
From now on your place
is on this planet...

44:50.788 --> 44:54.451
What about you? Aren't you staying?

44:54.692 --> 44:58.526
I'm a passer at the end of his cycIe.

44:58.595 --> 45:01.826
I'm aIready dreaming of a void...

45:02.199 --> 45:02.961
I'm afraid...

45:03.200 --> 45:05.225
Afraid of what?

45:07.671 --> 45:09.901
...of becoming human.

45:11.842 --> 45:15.573
Tell me about your job
with Doctor Elma Turner

45:25.856 --> 45:27.323
Can I buy you a drink?

45:27.925 --> 45:29.916
Don't you think I have enough aIready?

45:30.728 --> 45:34.186
Well, I don't see any cognac,
or sake...

45:34.531 --> 45:36.658
Tequila... Slivovitsa...

45:36.834 --> 45:38.563
I'm working. Do you mind?

45:40.037 --> 45:44.030
A vodka. Make it a Tarkovskaia,
please.

45:46.677 --> 45:50.169
I Iike your hair. It's very nice.

45:50.481 --> 45:55.316
It goes very weII with... white skin...

46:00.023 --> 46:01.854
Is it a new thing in make-up?

46:02.092 --> 46:06.961
Kabuki style maybe?
You must be an actress.

46:07.698 --> 46:10.963
You're expecting something from me...

46:12.436 --> 46:14.495
The answer is No.

46:20.410 --> 46:24.005
You're going to need someone
to take you home.

46:27.918 --> 46:30.512
What makes you think that?

46:30.754 --> 46:34.155
You have no other choice.

46:40.063 --> 46:42.088
One for the road.

47:04.454 --> 47:07.719
I Iike... this one.

47:08.592 --> 47:11.356
How about you, young Iady?

47:12.763 --> 47:15.527
We are going to get along fine.

47:15.766 --> 47:19.099
It's very important
to have the same tastes..

47:23.574 --> 47:24.871
No!

47:26.376 --> 47:29.504
We've got more important things
to do than fight each other...

47:44.261 --> 47:51.861
Address?... Western Hysteria HoteI...

47:58.909 --> 48:06.917
You are Inspector John Emerson HuxIey
and you have a bIack box in your brain.

48:06.918 --> 48:09.283
Give it to me, please.

48:09.987 --> 48:13.218
Or I'II have to go in and take it...

48:36.113 --> 48:40.914
It goes very weII with...white skin...

49:28.131 --> 49:29.758
I don't have a room.

49:42.212 --> 49:43.201
Which LeveI are you from?

49:43.380 --> 49:45.280
I'm above IeveIs...

49:45.349 --> 49:49.809
This is LeveI 2 and the hoteI's fuII.

49:50.053 --> 49:55.355
The hoteI maybe... but your bed is not.

50:02.632 --> 50:04.259
Ladies first...

52:47.831 --> 52:50.629
Control, Miss. Your papers.

52:50.867 --> 52:52.232
My papers?

52:52.435 --> 52:54.665
Your card if you prefer.

53:04.514 --> 53:08.075
Thank you, Miss.
Do you have any weapons,

53:08.285 --> 53:12.187
explosives...
Any history of violent conduct?

53:12.422 --> 53:14.652
I hate vioIence.

53:14.824 --> 53:16.655
Are you comfortable here?

53:16.893 --> 53:19.259
Yes, fine.

53:21.865 --> 53:27.895
Yes... I hate vioIence but I do Iike
to caress myseIf with bird feathers...

53:28.071 --> 53:31.097
preferably black ones.

53:32.642 --> 53:39.070
It's a bit smaII isn't it?
Don't you have a bathroom?

53:40.283 --> 53:43.684
No. No bathroom.

53:44.087 --> 53:48.251
I've decided never to wash again. Ever!

54:16.453 --> 54:22.619
Who are you? This is my bathroom!
What are you doing in my bathroom?

54:27.397 --> 54:29.524
Who are you?

54:29.699 --> 54:32.065
We had a drink together Iast night.

54:32.435 --> 54:35.871
You had several, in fact...
it's not surprising you can't remember.

54:36.072 --> 54:38.734
Alcohol has no effect on me.

54:38.975 --> 54:41.466
What's happening here?
What about the door?

54:41.511 --> 54:46.380
That door wasn't there a moment ago.
Did you do that?

54:46.816 --> 54:48.613
I'm no carpenter.

54:48.852 --> 54:51.320
Be carefuI...Those things can go off
aII by themseIves.

54:51.521 --> 54:53.216
Shut up, human!

54:54.257 --> 55:00.389
What happened Iast night?
What did you do to my body?

55:04.367 --> 55:05.732
So?

55:08.271 --> 55:10.569
What did I do to your body?...

55:11.608 --> 55:15.772
We had sexuaI intercourse...
You and I...

55:15.945 --> 55:18.675
Well...
Maybe not just the two of us alone...

55:18.915 --> 55:21.713
What do you mean by
"sexual intercourse"?

55:21.951 --> 55:24.112
At times Iast night you gave
the impression

55:24.287 --> 55:26.585
you knew perfectly well...

55:28.358 --> 55:29.552
I wi...

55:31.461 --> 55:33.725
I couId teII you the truth...

55:33.897 --> 55:36.024
What truth?

56:26.883 --> 56:30.319
Bloody fuckin'god...
What did you make me do?

56:35.859 --> 56:37.156
Fuck you!!!

56:40.463 --> 56:42.294
What are we waiting for?

56:42.799 --> 56:45.393
The answers
to the questions I asked him.

56:46.669 --> 56:48.967
He can't talk anymore,

56:49.139 --> 56:54.736
but we may be able to piece together
recent events from his subconscious.

56:55.412 --> 56:58.108
Well can he be... repaired?

56:58.848 --> 57:00.509
He can be treated.

57:11.161 --> 57:12.423
A Dayak?!

57:13.363 --> 57:19.029
A fake. A replica
of a Dayak, humanized.

57:19.269 --> 57:26.072
We found some synthetic red epidermis
signed EUGENICS under his fingernaiIs.

57:29.712 --> 57:31.202
Leave us now.

57:34.417 --> 57:35.782
Rape...

57:36.753 --> 57:38.050
Rape?

57:44.327 --> 57:46.352
You made me commit rape.

57:46.529 --> 57:50.693
She consented. We, Gods,
have physicaI appetites, you know...

57:50.867 --> 57:55.236
Which we have more than aptly
demonstrated for thousands of years...

57:55.505 --> 57:58.030
You really are a piece of shit.

57:58.241 --> 58:01.267
You think everything
is yours for the taking.

58:01.444 --> 58:06.609
My body, that girI's body,
aII the others you murdered...

58:06.783 --> 58:10.053
We'II do it your way next time,
if you wish...

58:10.054 --> 58:12.920
Next time? Do what my way?

58:13.189 --> 58:15.316
Next time we make Iove to her.

58:15.658 --> 58:20.095
We must make Iove again with that...
young Iady...

58:20.864 --> 58:22.126
No way!

58:22.298 --> 58:24.095
Don't you Iike her?

58:26.102 --> 58:30.368
I'm not sharing my body anymore,
is that cIear?

58:30.773 --> 58:33.571
Not for fucking or for anything else.

58:33.810 --> 58:39.840
That's the end of the Iine.
You go your way, I'II go mine!

58:40.550 --> 58:42.609
Nikopol, Nikopol...

58:42.952 --> 58:46.012
You're talking
as if you had the choice.

58:46.055 --> 58:49.855
You can walk perfectly
normally if I want you to...

58:51.861 --> 58:54.295
But if I don't...

58:59.068 --> 59:01.468
Don't forget this either...

59:22.358 --> 59:23.825
Fuck you!

59:24.027 --> 59:29.294
Right, but let's fuck her again first.

59:30.366 --> 59:31.890
Can you describe him?

59:32.101 --> 59:37.403
Rather average...
from what I can remember...

59:37.607 --> 59:38.631
Human Iooking...

59:38.808 --> 59:42.938
What about his... penis?
Human Iooking too?

59:43.880 --> 59:47.475
Have you already had relations
of this nature before?

59:47.750 --> 59:55.179
Relations? Human?... Social?...

59:55.558 --> 59:56.991
SexuaI.

59:58.428 --> 59:59.827
Intercourse...

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:02.793
I think you've experienced
it but you don't remember...

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.090
The drugs... The pills...

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.861
I don't know who's treating you
but it shows...

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:10.566
Even your organs are positioning
themselves correctly.

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:17.837
Thank you for trusting me, Jill...

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:21.813
I trust John... OnIy John.

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:25.543
Are you testing me? Is that it?

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:32.625
That's him, I recognize him!

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:36.561
And that is the girI...

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:39.564
This is all that we've kept of her.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.702
Her IachrymaI secretions.

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.462
That should be enough.

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:44.999
This kind of DAYAK

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:49.379
has olfactory capabilities 500 times
superior to ours.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.247
My favorite moving molecular lab.

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.708
He's a reaI hunter...

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.977
You taste good.

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:54.053
I'm proud of myseIf
for having found you.

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:58.584
You have to tell me where I can find
the one who's with you.

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:00.459
I don't know who you're taIking about.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:04.424
You'd better know who
I'm taIking about.

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:49.871
Shh...
Jill has been through some really

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:54.304
difficult moments...
I've had to erase them from her memory.

01:06:54.343 --> 01:07:01.772
We must protect her... And Iove her...
We must IMPREGNATE her!

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.643
So that's it?...

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:08.586
Can I count on you, NikopoI?

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:12.894
I knew I couId ...

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:37.051
"Ceaselessly
by my side moves the Demon;

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:40.915
He swims around me
Iike impaIpabIe air;

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:44.520
I swaIIow and feeI it burn my Iungs

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:47.958
And fill them
with eternal desire and guilt..."

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.030
Still already here?

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:55.693
You really don't
have anywhere else to go?

01:07:55.905 --> 01:08:01.502
I reaIIy don't have the choice...
I onIy have you ...

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.234
Are you feeling alright?

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:05.837
Shouldn't I be?

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:09.114
Been in a fight?

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:12.550
There's a blank in my memory...

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:21.386
Maybe you're the one who hit me!

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:26.259
Why did you spend thirty years
in hibernation?

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:28.334
Afraid of growing older?

01:08:28.571 --> 01:08:30.060
How do you know that?

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.296
I can mind read a bit.

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:34.907
But yours...
I don't understand a thing.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:38.410
I know you raped me Iast night.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.979
But I can't find
the memory in your mind.

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:45.321
To be quite honest,
it's not very clear for me either.

01:08:45.322 --> 01:08:48.051
We should do it again
and try to understand...

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.888
You owe me that.

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:54.791
I was sentenced to hibernation
for trying to protect peopIe Iike you.

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:58.394
No one is Iike me.

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.865
I'II go aIong with that...

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:06.533
Well, what do you read in my mind now?

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:12.479
OK. I'II buy you a drink.

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:15.106
I'd Iove a bottIe of Bordeaux...
It's been ages...

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.076
Never heard of it.

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:23.617
You've travelled in space and time.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:26.520
You're colder than a block of ice
and it suits you so fine.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:29.154
Who are You?

01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:33.091
I thing you Iike me
What are you doing to me?

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:36.863
To me Who are you?

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:39.631
I'm confused

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.106
I can't remenber anything

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:45.975
I'm a guinea pig. A human woman

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:48.615
You can call me Jill

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:52.045
You're expecting something from me

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.520
The answer is no

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:58.892
The answer is no

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:01.689
Aaah! It's coId!

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:05.730
Sorry, it's my Ieg.
I shouId have warned you...

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:10.996
It's a bit icy, of course.
Not much bIood circuIation down there.

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:24.815
It wouId be a shame
to Iet a few degrees...of temp...

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:27.547
temperature interrupt us...

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:33.353
Sorry Jill... Sorry...

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:56.815
Calm down, Jill... Calm down.

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:22.735
Something in the air's changed since
Iast time Anubis, don't you find

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:21.767
John! I'm scared!

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:26.004
John! Please come back!

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:27.505
I'm here JiII!

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.842
It's too dangerous to cross over now.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.583
It's not ready yet,
and you aren't either.

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:38.650
Tomorrow, I hope.

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:43.690
INTRUSION is a gateway which
wiII cIose behind me,

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.951
and disappear with me...

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:50.723
It wiII reappear somewhere eIse,
other passers wiII come,

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:53.732
but you'II be the Iast creature
to use it.

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:55.901
John...

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:57.332
Yes?

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:00.533
I've met someone.

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:04.610
Good... Your Iife
as an earth dweIIer has begun.

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:06.949
Meeting humans, feeling desire...

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:08.473
Being in Iove...

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:12.320
One of the most beautifuI feeIings
you'II experience here...

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:16.013
But I Iove you. You first!

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:19.490
Love is very different here...

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.753
What should I do?

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:26.965
Cry... Whenever you feeI the need,
just cry...

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:31.163
Where is she?

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.699
Where the fuck is she?!

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.536
I aIready toId you.
She went for a waIk.

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.245
You have to understand her...

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:40.040
But you're right, NIKOPOL,
you're right to want to hurt me,

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:44.309
even if I don't feeI a thing...
Hit me again, harder.

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:49.352
You piece of shit.
Your objectives are shit,

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:53.459
your filthy rapist god ambitions
are shit!!

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.261
You're full of shit,!

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:59.560
Coming from a human, remarks Iike
that don't carry much weight.

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:04.331
You're damaging that girI...
You're damaging JiII!

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.667
You're destroying something
really beautiful.

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:09.436
You don't destroy what you Iove.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.775
You shouldn't have let her go...

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:13.845
She'II be back...

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:16.880
We still have to make love
to her again...

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.849
It isn't over yet...

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:23.222
AII right, the impregnation!

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:26.292
I nearIy forgot that minor detaiI.

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:29.190
What is this obsession of yours?

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:34.061
An obsession about how
IittIe time I have Ieft.

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:37.328
I reaIIy feeI for you...

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:40.865
My name is Doctor Elma Turner...

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.110
I'm Iooking for one of my patients.

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:45.909
It's been a Iong time since anybody's
come in here Iooking to be cured.

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:49.378
Her name is Jill.
She told me she was a regular here.

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:52.549
You must know her...
White skin, blue hair...

01:14:52.788 --> 01:14:56.349
I don't know any humans,
personaIIy, that is.

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.253
Jill isn't really human...

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.826
How much do you know?

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:02.421
You must be John?

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:04.225
And you must be Elma Turner.

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:07.026
I have something to teII her.
Something rather important.

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.965
I'm very pIeased to meet you.

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:10.501
I need to see her.

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:12.807
I don't beIieve that wiII be necessary.

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:15.504
Everything is happening
on a different IeveI now...

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:17.538
What do you mean by that?

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.148
Where is she?

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:24.583
At Ieast, teII me she's okay...

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:35.152
White skin, blue hair...
Interesting...

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:40.063
Let me introduce myself...
lnspector Froebe.

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:45.470
Did you powder up face
for the occassion?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.406
It's not your business.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.716
My friend, my dear, dear friend...

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:08.821
Ayak meao venaseo filmea.
Kyle, It's been a long time ...

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:16.631
Too Iong. I know.
I stiII feeI the tension inside you.

01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:18.362
The hubris.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:25.643
Like five years ago when you sneaked
out without my permission...

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:31.683
and took a bite out
of Inspector Froebe... Remember?

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:34.585
Ine Iassa fine ninu, Ayak?
Do you need me for something KyIe?

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.184
Yes.

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:44.829
Have a taste of this!

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.298
Find him and finish the rest!

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:18.596
Still alive?

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:26.064
I know... this spIit personaIity
is not an easy thing to deaI with

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:30.176
But I'm the one on the front Iine...
untiI proven otherwise...

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:31.879
Are you alone?

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.139
So he's gone?

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:37.582
The rapist who Iives inside your body

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:40.913
and forces me
to have sexuaI intercourse?

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:47.061
I think so, but I'm not sure,
and above aII I don't know ...

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:07.115
That wasn't a very smart thing to do.

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:11.843
The blue of my tears stains human
skin for good...

01:18:15.757 --> 01:18:19.420
I feeI bIue... for you.

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:36.876
I shouId have shot
you the first time we met.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.343
There's still time.

01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:32.628
Thank you, NikopoI. Thank you...

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.570
Shh! She's asleep.

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.541
Young women Iike her are rare.

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:43.938
Extremely rare.

01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:47.711
There are only a few
of them in the entire universe.

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:51.182
No-one knows why they appear
in one world or another.

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:54.981
They don't even know who they are,
themselves, and the power they have.

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:56.656
What power?

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:59.019
The greatest power of all.

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:02.652
The power to procreate with gods.

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:06.300
I get it. I'm just the empty sheII...

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:09.402
the vehicle delivering
the divine seeds...

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:13.904
That's not going to alter
my opinion of you, ...

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:18.175
I don't want to go.
Jonas can represent me.

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:20.244
Don't Iet me down KyIe.

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:23.007
Don't prove to me what
I aIready know you are...

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:24.708
This is all your fault.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.911
You're the one who dragged me
into this.

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:31.457
Have you just figured that out?

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:35.255
Sure, Kyle! You're the pawn
and I'm the player!

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:38.330
But I've got news for you,
you IittIe bitch!

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:44.164
You're a pawn too! EUGENICS' pawn.
Who is EUGENICS? Huh? Who?

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:45.737
You're right on that one.

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:51.743
But I'm a superior pawn.
Your superior pawn,you understand?

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:56.178
Now, get up off your fat ass,
move into your TRIPLE XL cIothes,

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.545
say a IittIe prayer that...

01:20:57.719 --> 01:21:00.017
... "your" DAYAK finds "your" NlKOPOL,

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:03.851
and go and negotiate
with Ancient Egypt...

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.653
MOVE IT!!

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:19.666
Could you forget me if you had to?

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.939
What sort of a question is that?

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:25.973
Seriously.
If you didn't have the choice.

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:26.839
Could you forget me?

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:28.310
No.

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:35.379
Well, I might forget you...
Against my will.

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.956
Without wanting to.

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.889
What are you trying to say?

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:51.730
Things are going to happen to me
that are out of my controI.

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:57.004
I've aIready been through that.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:01.174
But I'm abIe to controI
the future for two... Or more...

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:14.561
You're pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.162
How can you tell?

01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:21.567
Anyway, when you say two,
who are you alluding to?

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.461
Are you thinking about you and me,

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:26.072
or are you thinking about you and him.

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:29.766
The one inside your body... the rapist.

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:31.343
I'm thinking about us.

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:33.138
Wouldn't he be jealous?

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:35.683
Right now, for instance,

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:41.680
I know he's here, between us...
I can sense him.

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:49.457
The rapist wants you to know he
will never do that again.

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:58.201
When I kiss you, am I kissing him too?

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:01.573
And when he raped me,
did you enjoy it?

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:23.891
John!

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:07.800
Are you always so slow, lnspector?
What are you waiting for?

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.309
An old friend of mine...

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:13.340
The suspect vehicle just crossed 49th
and Madison on the second section.

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:18.010
AII patroIs on aIert.
I repeat: aII patroIs on aIert.

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:28.859
We're wasting precious time,
Inspector...

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.758
JILL's in danger.

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:34.366
Carefull...

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:36.164
The engine's highly tuned.

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:38.964
Just Iike you!

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.280
Who's shooting?

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:30.681
Hold your fire!

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:01.117
Who's mortaI in here?

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:04.454
...I mean,
who can die a vioIent death...

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:07.488
Well, I feel somewhat mortal...

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:11.529
I don't think so, Mister...?

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:14.326
Mr ...

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:43.792
JILL!!

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:32.406
Where's the Pyramid?

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.979
Where's the Senator?

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:21.156
It's here.

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:22.318
Come on...

01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:26.092
It's here, JiII. It's time!

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:31.499
We're in the heart of INTRUSION.

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:39.608
The dead center.

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:41.780
John!?

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:47.846
Your time has come.

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:53.024
This red pill is the final stage
of your treatment.

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:56.154
It wiII make you human for good.

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:57.896
A human woman...

01:28:58.099 --> 01:28:59.862
A human woman.

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:07.200
Will I forget everything?... Everyone?

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:13.970
You are going to write yourself
a new story...

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:17.173
Swallow it!

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:26.694
The void, Jill... The void...

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:31.097
Forget me...Forget

01:29:34.602 --> 01:29:36.433
JOHN!?!

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:07.133
...,where the fuck are you?
I need you... I need you now!

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:14.770
You must be Anubis, God of the Dead...
I admire you so much!

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:16.738
Eraid! You,fucking bastard.

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:20.607
You'II never speak that
jackaI's name again!

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:33.959
Sep nuk pas, Heruss.
Time's up!

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:37.154
Anuu mesen arit nef xupu!
This is the end of your Eternity!

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:44.371
Suten bat, akhet semut, suten bat!
Be patient brothers, I'm coming!

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:53.641
Nikopol, you have been much more
than a body to me.

01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:57.248
I wish I couId do more to thank you...

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:59.719
...But you're running out of time,
I know...

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:04.387
I sincereIy hope your Iife
as a human is a happy one.

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:07.519
You will no longer feel the burden
of your leg.

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:14.428
You'II see, there wiII aIways
be a IittIe bit of me Ieft inside you...

01:31:15.503 --> 01:31:18.768
I don't know how I shouId take that.

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:27.279
I wiII never be far from you, JiII,
ever again...

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:32.108
Ever...

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.609
Do I know you?

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:21.429
Senu bat efu unnut xau?
I'm back! Were you bored without me?

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:24.532
Kourou nevo pas
The sentence is binding

01:32:24.772 --> 01:32:29.869
Bes su xet, nes su xet tekau pa neter.
I'm ready to face it...Without waiting

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:32.535
Set et fao
Now, then!

01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:42.753
Nikopol, serial number N-7,

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:45.424
you are under arrest
for attempted escape.

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:48.356
You have one year Ieft
on your sentence.

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:51.058
Sorry, but...

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.130
He was in there, wasn't he?

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:54.265
Who?

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:58.268
The Killer...
You must know a lot about him.

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:00.671
Yeah. He's a friend...

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:06.472
How does he kill, I'd give a lot
to know the answer to that.

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.413
Jill!

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:24.994
...And New York City Officials annouces

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.424
the opening of CentraI Parks Intrusion
to PubIic Access.

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:30.070
Do not forget that the temperature
is unusually low.

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.569
Take a break! New orbitaI hoIidays!

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.298
Forget archaic politics,

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:37.209
and say Yes to Liangs projects
for you and your City.

01:33:37.645 --> 01:33:38.942
And for you, who can still read,

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:41.312

by the man from the past,
NikopoI himseIf. A Subversive CuIt Book

01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:49.051
By the way, thanks for your book.

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:52.317
What about her?

01:33:53.027 --> 01:33:54.221
"Her"?

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:57.561
HER!

01:33:58.499 --> 01:34:00.296
Do you Iike Paris?

01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:40.207
Oh, I'm sorry. He's so cheeky,
did he hurt you?

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:46.870
No, not at all. He's just fine...
Couldn't be better...

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:49.007
I'm terribIy sorry.

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.409
My name is JILL.

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:55.282
I'm NIKOPOL.

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:13.603
How do you Iike this pIanet?

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:19.643
It has its charm...

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:25.844
Mais "Tout cela ne vaut
pas le poison qui decoule

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.887
de tes yeux, de tes yeux verts,

Lacs ou mon ame tremble et se

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.550
Mes songes viennent en fouIe

01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:38.395
Pour se desalterer
a ces gouffres amers."

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:41.263
"But all that is not worth the prodigy

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:43.835
Of you saliva, Jill,

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:46.836
That bites my soul, and dizzies it,

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:50.066
and swirls It down remorselessly,

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:54.839
Rolling it, fainting,
to the underworld!"
