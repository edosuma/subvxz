WEBVTT

00:03.490 --> 00:06.430
I don't know why, but I feel like Turk and Carla are upset with me.

00:07.370 --> 00:09.850
Still, I can't be sure, so it's always good to test.

00:10.550 --> 00:12.100
May I have a pancake please?

00:15.090 --> 00:16.180
Okay, they're mad.

00:19.390 --> 00:21.340
I'm pretty sure it's because of my new girlfriend.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.450
She's amazing.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.040
Don't get me wrong, she's not the warmest person.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.520
You know, the funniest thing happened...

00:27.555 --> 00:28.210
I'm eating.

00:29.050 --> 00:29.720
Sorry.

00:30.710 --> 00:31.840
I'm starvin'.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.240
Wish I hadn't left my wallet at home.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.780
Mmm, bread.

00:40.420 --> 00:42.710
Also, the sex could be a little impersonal.

00:44.970 --> 00:46.850
So that's a no on cuddling?

00:50.620 --> 00:52.710
Still, Turk and Carla's main problem with Neena...

00:52.745 --> 00:54.800
is that she's a malpractice attorney who's suing Turk.

00:55.270 --> 00:59.200
Needless to say, I was doing everything I could not to rub the relationship in Turk's face.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.590
I could probably do more.

01:02.220 --> 01:02.940
Morning.

01:04.590 --> 01:05.900
I'll see you at the deposition.

01:06.490 --> 01:09.430
I'll try not to spank your lawyer as hard as I spanked him last night.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.660
Bye!

01:13.950 --> 01:16.280
FYI, there was no spanking last night, okay?

01:16.410 --> 01:17.220
Really?

01:18.430 --> 01:20.050
- Yeah.
- Then this won't hurt.

01:21.070 --> 01:21.810
Nope.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.180
Hit him again baby.

01:25.070 --> 01:25.850
Why?

01:27.930 --> 01:30.255
After spreading half a tube of what I thought...

01:30.290 --> 01:32.580
was burn ointment on my butt, it was off to work.

01:34.550 --> 01:36.160
- What smells like Vagisil?
- Nothing.

01:36.195 --> 01:37.220
How can I help you?

01:37.510 --> 01:39.430
Remember how I thought Mr. Peterson's back pain...

01:39.465 --> 01:41.020
was sacroiliitis and you said it wasn't?

01:41.660 --> 01:43.010
Well, I was right.

01:45.470 --> 01:48.980
Elliot, you should never use scalding hot coffee for a victory sip.

01:49.015 --> 01:50.200
It's a beginner's mistake.

01:50.370 --> 01:52.130
Oh yeah? Well you're ***so something something ***.

01:52.260 --> 01:55.050
Over the past few months Eliot's come into her own as a doctor.

01:55.420 --> 01:58.470
Now that her mentor Molly is gone, she wants to prove it wasn't a fluke.

01:58.770 --> 01:59.760
Attention staff:

01:59.920 --> 02:02.840
One of our hospital's board members is coming in as a patient.

02:02.870 --> 02:05.000
The first doctor to my office gets to treat him.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.340
Of course around here, everybody's looking to prove themselves.

02:08.449 --> 02:09.150
Go.

02:47.770 --> 02:49.400
So Craig, how's your grandmother doing?

02:49.830 --> 02:52.530
Oh, she's much better now, thanks. Turns out it was just...

03:05.010 --> 03:05.770
Thanks!

03:28.230 --> 03:30.860
J.D., how could you do this to Turk?

03:31.030 --> 03:34.570
You two are so close that I occasionally have nightmares of you running away together.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.510
Where do we go?

03:35.620 --> 03:36.955
One time we went to Aspen.

03:36.990 --> 03:39.100
Oh, I hope it was summer. I'm not that big a skier.

03:39.135 --> 03:41.910
Girls! I want an explanation.

03:42.340 --> 03:43.630
Fine. Turk, tell her our code.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.020
If you haven't had sex in six months, you're not accountable for who you sleep with.

03:47.620 --> 03:50.580
Oh please, when you were single, you were never that desperate...

03:50.615 --> 03:51.350
Were you?

03:57.900 --> 04:00.860
Oh that was amazing.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.750
Yes, it was.

04:05.890 --> 04:08.110
We're all God's children in the dark.

04:08.590 --> 04:11.460
Christopher Duncan Turk, you tell him how you really feel,

04:11.495 --> 04:14.330
just like you told me last night, or I will do it for you.

04:17.269 --> 04:22.420
Baby! Why does he hurt me so bad?

04:22.910 --> 04:24.160
I want you to stop seeing her.

04:24.700 --> 04:28.120
Fine. But I'm only ending it because friends come first.

04:28.290 --> 04:29.780
Plus, you already had sex with her.

04:29.815 --> 04:31.130
Four a half times!

04:31.280 --> 04:32.050
Lata!

04:36.290 --> 04:39.950
Jordan. You're on the board, what is the story on my patient Mr. Summers?

04:39.985 --> 04:42.385
Well Stick, I'm going to warn you the same way...

04:42.420 --> 04:44.860
I warn Perry every time I have more than three scotches.

04:44.890 --> 04:46.140
Prepare to have your ass grabbed!

04:46.990 --> 04:49.440
That's disturbing in like... eight different ways.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.360
Barbie, the guy's a sexist pig. He's gonna eat you alive.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.180
Look, I'm not the same doctor I was four years ago.

04:55.215 --> 04:56.860
I'm smarter, I'm more confident...

04:56.895 --> 04:58.485
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.850
Just skip the rest of your "I'll show you speech"

05:00.885 --> 05:03.430
and just walk away in a huff. I'm very busy.

05:04.060 --> 05:04.960
Thank you!

05:08.630 --> 05:10.065
So should we start this deposition,

05:10.100 --> 05:12.100
or do you boys just want to hand us a big bag of money?

05:13.270 --> 05:14.880
Big bag of money...

05:15.920 --> 05:18.100
You aren't going to freeze up around her again, are you Ted?

05:18.380 --> 05:20.490
No chance. I'm drugged up.

05:20.740 --> 05:22.195
Plus, if I concentrate,

05:22.230 --> 05:26.420
I think I can control the excessive flop sweat I get the second she speaks.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.370
Ted, you ready to get started?

05:31.710 --> 05:33.180
Whenever you're ready, Neena.

05:34.180 --> 05:37.190
First off, I'd just like to say that these charges...

05:41.230 --> 05:42.740
We should take a short recess.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.480
Believe me, you're better off.

05:44.530 --> 05:45.350
I agree.

05:45.600 --> 05:49.550
Now, Mr. Corman is contending that the shoulder surgery he received ruined his tennis serve.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.930
I'd like to start by asking Dr. Turk if his diabetes...

05:53.210 --> 05:55.100
could have affected his performance in surgery.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.360
You're diabetic?

05:56.420 --> 05:57.395
Yes. I told you that.

05:57.430 --> 05:58.480
I thought you were joking.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.930
How is that funny?

06:00.000 --> 06:03.400
Well, it's a very serious disease. And I don't like you.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.430
How do we even know he plays tennis?

06:13.250 --> 06:16.330
Look at him. He's awful! You are awful!

06:16.365 --> 06:17.370
Wait for the serve.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.010
We're settling.

06:24.420 --> 06:27.100
Hey, I want you to know that I still think you're a great doctor.

06:27.190 --> 06:31.080
And I've been talking to my rabbi a lot lately about me finally getting circumsized.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.960
It's not a religious thing, it's... it's more for the ladies.

06:34.490 --> 06:35.310
What?

06:41.820 --> 06:42.770
Hey Neena.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.540
God help me, I'm going to miss that smile.

06:46.290 --> 06:50.300
I think because of the whole Turk situation we should probably stop seeing each other.

06:51.570 --> 06:52.390
No.

06:52.470 --> 06:55.130
You can't just say no. No is the answer to a question.

06:55.170 --> 06:58.880
And I clearly wasn't asking a question, Neena. I was making a dramatic statement.

06:58.915 --> 07:01.930
And I'm sorry, but that statement was goodbye.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.950
You know, one of us is going to tire eventually.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.900
So how are we feeling Mr. Summers?

07:19.300 --> 07:22.480
I feel like my ex-wife is standing on my chest.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.480
And not the pretty one.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.430
The fat one that had all my kids.

07:27.590 --> 07:29.850
Fantastic! I'd like to start by...

07:29.885 --> 07:31.335
Listen, Goldilocks.

07:31.370 --> 07:33.445
Unless the next three words out of your mouth...

07:33.480 --> 07:37.690
are some combination of sponge, bath, and my big white ass,

07:37.725 --> 07:39.010
I'm not interested.

07:39.650 --> 07:45.330
Now, how about you be a nice little nurse and go find my doctor.

07:45.870 --> 07:46.905
Actually sir...

07:46.940 --> 07:48.740
His name is Elliot Reid.

07:49.420 --> 07:51.200
So, what's the word?

07:51.760 --> 07:53.070
This guy any good?

07:55.240 --> 07:56.580
Oh, he rocks!

08:00.630 --> 08:03.270
Baby, you know if my malpractice insurance goes through the roof,

08:03.305 --> 08:05.570
you're going to have to take a step down lifestyle-wise.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.280
I live in a tiny apartment with my husband, his best friend,

08:08.315 --> 08:11.140
and their dead stuffed dog. What's the step down?

08:12.300 --> 08:13.530
Hey come on!

08:13.840 --> 08:18.070
One of the most amazing things about you is that you never let anything beat you.

08:18.170 --> 08:20.470
- Yeah, I am pretty impressive.
- Yes you are.

08:20.490 --> 08:23.160
Now don't you let anything else get into that beautiful head of yours.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.310
Okay?

08:24.660 --> 08:27.150
What could get into this man's head, baby? Huh?

08:27.540 --> 08:28.760
Tough day, huh?

08:29.290 --> 08:30.490
You wanna talk about it?

08:34.360 --> 08:35.549
Neena, it's over.

08:36.230 --> 08:37.100
No it's not.

08:37.530 --> 08:39.534
In fact, I find myself oddly turned on...

08:39.570 --> 08:42.690
by your timid baby horse standing up for the first time style of lovemaking.

08:42.900 --> 08:43.900
First of all, thank you.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.040
Secondly, I tried to be reasonable.
Now if you want to see my dark side,

08:47.075 --> 08:48.470
you're going to see my dark side.

08:49.350 --> 08:50.665
A- tickletickletickletickle...

08:50.700 --> 08:52.565
A- tickletickletickletickletickle...

08:52.600 --> 08:54.430
Yet another strong moment for you?

08:54.760 --> 08:56.550
Okay, fine, why don't you just tell me how this ends?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.980
You won't break up with me, you will betray your friend.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.090
What is this, some kind of lawyer mind trick? It's not gonna happen!

09:02.125 --> 09:03.760
- Sit down.
- I won't, I'm leaving.

09:04.260 --> 09:05.480
You're going to have sex with me.

09:05.515 --> 09:06.920
I'll do nothing of the sort.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.550
And as the ultimate act of betrayal,

09:10.860 --> 09:14.870
you will do it on the very same sweat and tear-soaked table where I crushed your friend.

09:15.530 --> 09:17.275
Oh, I hate a dirty table.

09:17.310 --> 09:19.020
You love a dirty table.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.570
God help me, I do. I do love a dirty table.

09:25.590 --> 09:27.680
Okay, Mr. Summers. Your EKGs came back...

09:27.715 --> 09:29.340
and Dr. Reid liked what he saw.

09:29.710 --> 09:31.420
When the hell am I getting out of here?

09:31.630 --> 09:34.260
Dr. Reid thought you might ask that and he had an answer for you.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.510
Shut your cakehole!

09:35.650 --> 09:37.790
He also said for you to stop paying off orderlies to sneak...

09:37.825 --> 09:39.350
you cheeseburgers, you big load.

09:39.700 --> 09:43.190
Wow, he's old school. Like me.

09:43.940 --> 09:46.770
Hey! That belongs to Dr. Reid!

09:47.200 --> 09:48.430
So you and Reid...

09:49.000 --> 09:51.020
Yes. We're lovers.

09:51.540 --> 09:52.810
Red hot lovers.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.620
I'm guessing he's married.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.200
She doesn't understand him like I do.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.100
I love this guy.

09:59.135 --> 10:00.370
Not like I do.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.015
Hey, Turk's kind of in a dark place right now,

10:06.050 --> 10:09.760
so stay away from him, okay?
Nothing personal, you're just an awful human being.

10:09.800 --> 10:14.000
Of course. But, uh, we kind of crossed paths already.

10:14.470 --> 10:18.130
Life is pointless Gandhi, and I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.020
The only thing more pointless than life itself is being a doctor.

10:22.055 --> 10:25.795
I mean, bottom line, you spend eight years and 200Gs

10:25.830 --> 10:28.590
trying to get through med school and what do you have to show for it?

10:28.720 --> 10:31.980
I'll tell ya. A diploma on your wall, and a bullseye on your back.

10:32.670 --> 10:35.530
And you reminded him that people are basically good.

10:36.630 --> 10:39.495
People suck. They suck. And make no mistake about it,

10:39.530 --> 10:43.590
even sweet little old ladies are looking to bend you over a chair in court.

10:43.970 --> 10:44.810
Come on.

10:45.970 --> 10:46.980
We covered people.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.300
And I know you would never do anything to ruin his innocence.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.755
You see, there's a compartment in the hat.

10:55.790 --> 10:59.480
So the stinkin' rabbit is actually in there the whole time.

10:59.990 --> 11:00.800
Right?

11:01.220 --> 11:03.700
People pretty much hear what they want to hear, okay?

11:03.740 --> 11:05.590
What did you do?

11:06.670 --> 11:09.350
Hey, excuse me. My son is interested in becoming a doctor,

11:09.385 --> 11:12.030
and I thought maybe you could tell him what it's like.

11:12.090 --> 11:14.480
I'd love to! I would love to!

11:15.390 --> 11:17.250
Do you have a dog, Bowl Cut?

11:18.340 --> 11:22.890
Well, I want you to find a pile of its best work and roll all around in it.

11:23.330 --> 11:26.310
See, that's how it feels to be a doctor. Because here's the dirty little secret.

11:26.820 --> 11:30.870
People don't want your help. They want your dignity, they want your pride,

11:30.905 --> 11:32.720
but mostly, they want your money.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.510
Good luck in med school.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.860
Oh! The next time you see a magic show,

11:40.130 --> 11:42.550
the bunny was in the hat the whole time.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.260
Peace out!

11:47.310 --> 11:49.020
You are so dead.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.420
You can only keep the truth hidden for so long.

11:53.600 --> 11:57.140
Enough is enough. I want to meet this Dr. Reid!

11:57.920 --> 11:59.140
No problem!

11:59.300 --> 12:00.470
Frick!

12:00.930 --> 12:02.310
Turk, wait!

12:03.260 --> 12:05.400
Let's sit down and talk about this.

12:05.490 --> 12:08.410
And when the truth comes out, it doesn't set you free as much as you'd hope.

12:10.710 --> 12:11.900
Hey buddy!

12:12.000 --> 12:14.140
Especially if it involves betraying your best friend.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.990
Did we win?

12:22.470 --> 12:23.515
Wait, hold on Turk!

12:23.550 --> 12:25.610
Haven't you ever heard of keeping your enemies closer?

12:25.780 --> 12:27.415
I was just keeping her closer! Turk!

12:27.450 --> 12:30.480
Hey Gandhi! Gandhi, I think we should talk. What do you say?

12:30.580 --> 12:32.590
Sure, Dr. Cox and I were feeling guilty.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.760
But if Turk didn't want to talk about it, we were in the clear.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.110
May I have a word with you two?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.590
Okay, who wants to be me?

12:43.580 --> 12:46.070
Craig, you're probably still mad at me. Anyone else?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.470
Dr. Reid. At your service.

12:49.730 --> 12:53.150
Okay, that's a no for Todd. Isn't there anyone here that I can trust to be me?

12:54.410 --> 12:58.400
Hello. I'm Dr. Reid. Dr. Elliot Reid.

12:59.190 --> 13:00.230
I'm a doctor.

13:02.940 --> 13:05.160
What is the matter with you two?

13:05.290 --> 13:07.500
J.D., you said you were going to break up with Neena.

13:07.535 --> 13:08.565
I know! Believe me,

13:08.600 --> 13:10.910
the whole time we were having sex I was thinking about Turk.

13:11.830 --> 13:13.090
That came out wrong.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.260
And you!

13:14.490 --> 13:17.490
Why do you want everybody in this hospital to be as miserable as you?

13:17.550 --> 13:19.490
How could you not get this?

13:20.170 --> 13:21.720
What does misery love?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.470
- Alright, look...
- Company!

13:24.770 --> 13:26.380
Misery loves company!

13:27.840 --> 13:29.300
Misery loves company...

13:29.720 --> 13:30.570
Oh God...

13:30.700 --> 13:35.650
Okay, sure sure. Maybe we did screw up, just a pequito, but come on.

13:35.685 --> 13:38.230
We're definitely not the ones you want to be mad at.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.400
Oh yeah, then who?

13:39.550 --> 13:40.640
Hiya fellas!

13:53.920 --> 13:56.870
Summers, I think we can save your foot.

13:56.940 --> 13:58.730
- It's his heart.
- I know that.

13:58.980 --> 14:00.450
We're concerned about your ticker.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.570
Ah, yes. Yes yes.

14:19.650 --> 14:23.240
Well, your paper script looks good.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.610
But, I'm going to have to listen to that heart of yours.

14:39.110 --> 14:41.820
Well, I'm afraid I was wrong. We're going to have to take that foot.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.910
My talk with Carla gave me the courage to take a stand.

14:48.150 --> 14:50.570
After all, misery loves comradery.

14:50.610 --> 14:51.545
Look, Neena...

14:51.580 --> 14:54.250
If you talk about ending our relationship again, I'll punish you.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.460
Punish me? How?

14:58.550 --> 14:59.815
You know what, no, this is crazy.

14:59.850 --> 15:02.690
I am not going to get your name tattooed on my ankle, okay?

15:02.820 --> 15:04.380
Enough is enough! Alright?

15:04.440 --> 15:06.090
A man has to have his limits.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.770
Let's get out of here. Come on!

15:10.290 --> 15:12.330
And that's when I realized I would never be strong enough...

15:12.365 --> 15:14.560
to break Neena's hold over me. I needed help.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.370
I needed someone who was even scarier than she was.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.370
I needed a real witch.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.400
Someone must have left this here from Halloween.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.200
God, Dr. Cox is going to go off on me.

15:33.460 --> 15:36.270
It's going to be worse than the time my brother Barry caught me reading his Playgirl magazines.

15:36.470 --> 15:37.710
Don't you mean Playboy?

15:37.760 --> 15:38.590
No.

15:38.660 --> 15:40.040
So you're saying that your brother's...

15:40.075 --> 15:40.665
Yes.

15:40.700 --> 15:41.905
Has he actually told your family that...

15:41.940 --> 15:43.660
- No.
- But everyone's positive that he's...

15:43.910 --> 15:45.450
Do you think he and another guy have ever...

15:45.485 --> 15:46.480
No more questions.

15:48.110 --> 15:50.540
Elliot, if you can handle that sexist dirtbag in there,

15:50.575 --> 15:51.870
you can certainly handle Perry.

15:52.980 --> 15:54.040
Why are you being nice to me?

15:54.110 --> 15:56.950
Okay, Perry occasionally talks to me at home.

15:57.010 --> 15:59.135
And he told me that you don't need him as much anymore,

15:59.170 --> 16:02.470
and it annoys the hell out of him, which of course gives me endless enjoyment.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.475
Don't go backwards.

16:04.510 --> 16:06.145
Own what you did with Mr. Summers.

16:06.180 --> 16:09.670
You are so much stronger than all the other idiot residents around here.

16:10.860 --> 16:11.635
Really?

16:11.670 --> 16:14.120
Jordan? I need you to break up with somebody for me.

16:14.980 --> 16:15.850
Really.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.110
Hey. There's no pie here.

16:23.990 --> 16:26.870
Oh my God! Oh, you two are going to kill me!

16:26.905 --> 16:28.560
Nobody's going to kill you.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.980
Hi, I'm Dr. Nobody.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.620
Oh, I see. This is your Hippocratic Oath? Schoolyard threats?

16:33.655 --> 16:35.150
Seriously, is there no pie?

16:35.185 --> 16:36.240
Look, Turk.

16:36.380 --> 16:39.660
I know you feel like you did right by him, but you have to acknowledge...

16:39.695 --> 16:42.090
that Mr. Corman here feels like you let him down.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.260
You know what? I don't feel that way.

16:45.910 --> 16:47.900
I know you did the best job you could.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.800
But there's something that you should know about me.

16:51.610 --> 16:52.770
People hate me.

16:53.820 --> 16:56.710
But in tennis, they're forced to interact.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.360
So for three hours, two Sundays a month,

17:01.280 --> 17:03.080
I have friends. You know what I mean?

17:04.079 --> 17:08.260
So what you're saying is that even though you think my husband did a great job,

17:08.460 --> 17:10.765
you've decided to crush his spirit by...

17:10.800 --> 17:14.430
putting a permanent black mark on his medical record over a tennis game?

17:15.319 --> 17:17.460
I fear I've said too much.

17:20.579 --> 17:22.819
Okay, this woman is horrifying, so don't panic.

17:22.950 --> 17:24.720
- I'll be fine.
- I was talking to myself.

17:24.819 --> 17:27.710
Oh, there you are. Go get in the backseat of my car and lie down on the floor.

17:27.790 --> 17:28.560
Okay.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.650
Neena, a word?

17:31.930 --> 17:33.440
Oh, it's so on.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.640
You got something to say? Say it.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.850
The thing about strong women... If you call them out,

17:50.885 --> 17:52.750
they're going to give you a piece of their mind.

17:53.620 --> 17:54.920
I should have known, Barbie.

17:55.270 --> 17:58.960
Hell, you have been impersonating a doctor since the first day you got here.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.255
Look, I did what I had to do to treat this guy.

18:01.290 --> 18:04.590
And as far as me being scared about you telling him that I'm full of crap?

18:04.680 --> 18:06.860
Hey Jerkwad! I'm Dr. Reid!

18:06.895 --> 18:07.685
What?!

18:07.720 --> 18:10.440
Oh, and by the way. I had a little chat with your wife.

18:10.580 --> 18:11.790
I know I'm in your head.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.320
It took me three years to move in and I am not moving out.

18:17.170 --> 18:18.655
Here's what's going to happen.

18:18.690 --> 18:21.600
You're going to drop this lawsuit because it's wrong and you know it.

18:21.635 --> 18:23.200
But also because if you don't,

18:23.280 --> 18:25.105
I'm going to pound the plaid right off that shirt...

18:25.140 --> 18:28.720
and make it so that the only way you'll be able to eat pie is through a straw.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.490
You come in here and walk around like you're the queen bee.

18:32.970 --> 18:34.150
Guess what, Missy.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.610
This is my house.

18:35.630 --> 18:37.920
You and Mr. Chestless here are over.

18:37.955 --> 18:39.960
So move on! Cause if you don't,

18:40.100 --> 18:44.490
I'm going to turn your little lame liason into a threesome, starring yours truly.

18:44.550 --> 18:46.710
And I don't kiss nice.

18:57.820 --> 19:00.300
And just like that we all knew who had won.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.490
Ouch.

19:03.380 --> 19:04.610
Yeah!

19:06.410 --> 19:08.100
Okay. Fine, it's over.

19:08.570 --> 19:09.780
I'm free?

19:10.790 --> 19:12.890
Hey you. Go get in the back of my car.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.210
Awesome.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.030
Wow. Thanks, Jordan.

19:22.430 --> 19:23.540
I'll see you around.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.110
Not so fast. You're my bitch now.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.290
Jordan's making me stretch out her new jeans.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.410
Cry me a river.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.710
You know what Gandhi's wife made me do this afternoon...

19:39.745 --> 19:41.830
because I supposedly crushed his spirit?

19:41.940 --> 19:42.730
What?

19:43.850 --> 19:46.580
Ever since the surgery I've been serving lefty.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.840
It's a little unpredictable, but I'm getting some good heat.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.550
Can't wait to see it.

19:55.060 --> 19:58.050
Hit you on the fly! Fifteen-love!

20:00.620 --> 20:02.040
Turk, I'm sorry about Neena.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.670
It's okay, man. She's a woman. I understand.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.230
And the truth was, he did understand.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.775
No matter how much we like to pretend otherwise,

20:10.810 --> 20:13.720
strong confident women will always have the power over us.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.380
Whether they're fighting for respect,

20:17.490 --> 20:18.740
fighting for their man,

20:19.470 --> 20:21.360
or even just fighting for the hell of it.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.450
Strong women make all guys feel the same way.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.350
Jordan looks mad, I should go.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.710
I have to pick up Carla's dry-cleaning.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.700
Well, what do we have here?

20:33.920 --> 20:35.700
Oh, no.

20:36.630 --> 20:40.600
I heard from a reliable source that you want to live in dumpster.

20:41.340 --> 20:45.120
I can arrange that. Yep, I know just the right neighborhood.
