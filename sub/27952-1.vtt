Please say pizza 'cause I feel like
that jam really worked.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.736
It's your Tía Ophelia. She's dead.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.446
Oh, my god, Mami. That's terrible.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.157
Who is she again?

00:33.116 --> 00:34.909
We can't remember either.

Okay, is she the tía
that always wears yellow?

That's Tía Big Bird.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.002
Pfft! That's Tía Bitchy.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.088

00:47.172 --> 00:48.798
Oh, Tía Ophelia.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.676
What a tragedy.

00:52.343 --> 00:55.263
We danced all night at Elena's quinces.

00:55.847 --> 00:59.059
She had scarlet fever as a child
and lost her right eye.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.146
Ophelia was the tía with the eye patch.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.440
Tía Jack Sparrow!

01:05.565 --> 01:07.650
Aha! I called her Tía Blackbeard,

01:07.734 --> 01:08.902
but then that got confusing

01:08.985 --> 01:11.321
because we have another tía
with an actual black beard.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.031
[laughter]

01:13.114 --> 01:14.115
[Elena] Sorry.

At least we'll get to see
the family at the funeral.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.290
Mimi, Maruchi, Rosita,
Tío Juanito, Baby Juanito,

01:22.373 --> 01:24.209
and now his baby Gordito Juanito.

01:25.835 --> 01:28.088
Aah! It'll be good to see everybody.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.799
Except, of course, La Diabla.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.344
Ooh, there is a Tía Diabla? [scoffs]

01:34.427 --> 01:35.595
Sounds hot.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.057
She's Abuelita's little sister, Mirtha.

01:39.140 --> 01:43.103
Who Mami has been mad at for 20 years
because of a stupid mantilla.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.979
Mami, Mirtha said she doesn't have it.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.190
-That's because--
-She's a liar.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.359
But didn't you--

01:49.442 --> 01:53.988
Rightfully accuse her
of having it all these years?

01:54.739 --> 01:56.199
Because she does.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.410
-Go comb your hair.
-I don't have to.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.247
[groans]

02:05.750 --> 02:07.669
So, what's a mantilla?

02:07.752 --> 02:10.004
Is that like a trans-tía?

02:10.630 --> 02:11.798
No.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.925
But I like that I'm in your head.

02:15.135 --> 02:19.973
A mantilla is a lace veil that's passed on
from bride to bride in our family,

02:20.056 --> 02:21.641
and you stitch the couple's name into it.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.101
It's a Spanish tradition.

02:23.476 --> 02:28.690
That is why we will never speak
to Mirtha and her family ever again.

02:28.982 --> 02:29.983
Right, Lupe?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.153
No.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.614
This ends now.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.533
As a matter of fact,

02:38.950 --> 02:41.911
I'm hosting the reception
after the funeral here.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.247
La Diabla at my house?

02:44.914 --> 02:47.250
She will never make it past that cross.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.628
Mami, the only thing
we're burying at this funeral

02:50.712 --> 02:52.255
is your feud and Tía Amelia.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.132
-[all] Ophelia.
-Aye! Whoever!

02:54.674 --> 02:56.301
[Lydia] How can you not take my side?

02:56.384 --> 02:58.136
Family is everything.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.305
You have to hate my sister.

03:00.388 --> 03:03.266
I am sick of this old-lady beef. Come on.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.268
This cost me my relationship
with Estrellita.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.229
[whispering] That's Mirtha's daughter,
your mami's cousin.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.315
She used to be my best friend.

03:10.398 --> 03:15.653
She even taught me the entire choreography
to Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation" video,

03:15.737 --> 03:17.780
which got me mad props

03:17.864 --> 03:20.074
in the Army.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.035
I don't think those are Janet's moves.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.120
Shut up. We improvised.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.997
You know what, Mami?

03:29.167 --> 03:32.086
If you don't settle this feud, I'll tell
the whole family you had a stroke.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.171
[gasps]

03:34.714 --> 03:36.132
Then they will think I'm old.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.509

Mami, what's that?

05:41.174 --> 05:44.469
All right. Pilar is definitely gay,
but nobody talks about it.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.221

"Well, you know Pilar. She's just..."

05:59.609 --> 06:02.236
Someone in this family
needs to accept her.

And I can shepherd her out of the closet
and into the light.

Like a lesbian Jesus?

06:09.118 --> 06:10.453
I love that.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.873
Because I have long hair,
and I'm a really good carpenter,

06:13.956 --> 06:15.875
and I look really good in Birkenstocks.

one of your letters, start reading it,

right there next to me, making me laugh

was gonna be okay.

than lose my beautiful locks,"

15:12.536 --> 15:16.790

I was creating your hair."

24:01.356 --> 24:03.066
is that life is too short.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.652
We shouldn't spend it fighting.

24:06.570 --> 24:10.490
Yeah, we're gonna have differences,
but what does that matter? We're family.

24:10.824 --> 24:11.700
Okay?

24:12.492 --> 24:14.870
-Familia para siempre.
-[all] Sí.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.830
[indistinct chattering]

24:18.623 --> 24:20.834
I am so glad we're good again.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.794
Promise me that we'll keep in touch.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.796
Of course, because we love each other
too much

24:24.880 --> 24:26.506
to let anything get in between us again.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.591
I wanna make a toast.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.052
[Penelope chuckles]

24:32.429 --> 24:33.305
To Ophelia.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.975
At least she got to see our President
make America great again.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.318
I'm sorry. What?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.488
