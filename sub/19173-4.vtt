00:16.149 --> 00:18.519
My instinct is the same now
as it was then.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.688
I will show them
what the consequences are

00:20.788 --> 00:23.091
for threatening that
which I hold most dear.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.195
Secure the rest of them.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.796
Set a course for Nassau.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.498
- You want to withdraw?
- If we don't,

00:30.598 --> 00:32.066
it will be the end
of whatever trust

00:32.165 --> 00:34.435
exists between us
and the slaves
on the island.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.337
The only way to free them safely

00:36.437 --> 00:37.671
is if it is all at once...

00:37.771 --> 00:40.174
simultaneous revolts
across the island.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.244
Billy and his men
are our enemies now,
but these men are not.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.818
Why do we need
an escort to the fort?

00:45.913 --> 00:47.615
Quickly, please.
We don't have much time.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.593
- Threats have been made.
- The story's been told.

00:49.617 --> 00:53.454
Everyone in Nassau knows
what Long John Silver's
return means,

00:53.554 --> 00:56.190
what's expected of them
when he does return.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.459
All that remains
is for him to return.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.810
We're not apart on this island.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.580
We cannot be apart.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.651
Many of you have got kin
at the Underhill estate.

03:03.751 --> 03:07.755
A reminder of how our fates
are bound together here.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.792
And then that kin of yours
aided in a revolt

03:11.892 --> 03:13.894
where three...

03:13.994 --> 03:16.930
Mr. Underhill,
his wife,

03:17.030 --> 03:21.769
and nine-year-old daughter
were murdered in cold blood.

03:21.869 --> 03:26.274
What happened there
is paid for here.

03:26.340 --> 03:30.878
I pray a lesson
that will not soon
be forgotten.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.880
Have you got something
to say, Julius?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.404
Get them back in the barracks.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.839
Nassau's fallen.
Aye.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.542
Get them back inside!

04:18.326 --> 04:20.661
Come on, protect the lady!
It's okay, it's okay!
Stay down.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.499
Quick, get on out of here!
Help her up!
Help her up!

04:25.599 --> 04:27.535
Get on!

04:27.635 --> 04:29.403
Go, go, go!

04:34.742 --> 04:35.609
Over here!

04:35.709 --> 04:37.811
Yah!

04:50.624 --> 04:52.760
Yah!

04:56.964 --> 04:58.699
You're hurt.
I'm fine.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.010
Is there a list of everyone
who made it inside?
Yes, ma'am.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.779
Bring it to me, please.
And find Max as well.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.147
I need to speak with her
right away.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.806
Move the harbor-facing guns.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.546
I want them pointed
toward the town and ready
for our first barrage.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.754
What is going on here?
Everything is
under control, ma'am.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.013
We'll have our counterattack
underway before nightfall.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.215
We're not moving those guns.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.394
There will be no barrage
and there will be
no counterattack.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.819
I beg your pardon?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.954
Firing those guns isn't
likely to achieve anything

05:21.054 --> 05:22.823
other than advertising
our panic and fear.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.658
Not to mention
wasting shot and powder,

05:24.758 --> 05:26.803
which will be invaluable
when the time does come
for its use.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.995
With all due respect, madam,

05:28.095 --> 05:29.963
it is our duty
to do everything
within our power

05:30.063 --> 05:32.533
to retake Nassau town.
It's lost.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.936
For the moment,
Nassau town is lost.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.005
That much is painfully clear.

05:38.105 --> 05:42.009
It is our duty now
to secure ourselves here,
conserve resources,

05:42.109 --> 05:43.587
and hold out until
the governor returns

05:43.611 --> 05:46.714
with whatever aid
he was able to muster
to combine with our force.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.826
Then we will launch
a credible assault to drive out
Captain Flint and his men.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.453
I've ensured we have
stores and provision
to last us weeks.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.723
But what if the governor
does not return?
He will return.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.859
And we will be prepared
to join him in fighting
our enemy when he does.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.828
Mrs. Rogers.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.329
Is that the list?

06:02.430 --> 06:04.632
Yes, ma'am, but...
Where is Max?

06:04.732 --> 06:07.267
I thought I asked you
to fetch her.
She's not here, ma'am.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.612
She isn't here?
What do you mean
she isn't here?

06:08.636 --> 06:10.471
She was the first name
I gave you to secure.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.440
I sent two of my best men
to retrieve her.

06:12.506 --> 06:16.910
But apparently
between there and here,
they were unsuccessful.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.531
Nassau works best
when its men know

06:37.631 --> 06:38.799
what crews they belong to

06:38.899 --> 06:40.701
and what captains
they answer to.

06:40.801 --> 06:44.137
Without structure,
disorder is only
to be expected.

06:44.237 --> 06:48.175
Now, you will begin with men
that you know and trust.

06:48.275 --> 06:52.312
And from there, you will begin
to reorganize your crews
as quickly as possible.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.848
Crews?
With no ships?

06:54.948 --> 06:57.485
Well, we've all hunted small...
piraguas or less.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.753
It'll have to start there
until things are settled.

06:59.853 --> 07:04.091
But it is the only way
there will be any semblance
of order in the meantime.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.828
There aren't gonna be many men
out there eager to take orders
anytime soon.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.631
You were chosen

07:10.731 --> 07:13.567
because I thought you were
worthy to be the first
captain's counsel

07:13.667 --> 07:15.002
of a restored Nassau.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.137
Do I need to reconsider?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.576
You heard him.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.186
What did he think?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.064
He was going to get
a different answer from me?

07:35.088 --> 07:37.791
Well, if in doubt,
ask someone else,
I suppose.

07:37.891 --> 07:41.394
The more they realize
there is no daylight
between you and I,

07:41.529 --> 07:44.231
the more they will learn
to accept our shared
authority.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.367
Is it safe, then, to admit
that I'm not sure he's wrong?

07:47.535 --> 07:50.170
It's bad out there.
Worse than I anticipated.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.541
All life begins
in violence and wailing.
It will pass.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.943
A lot of things begin
with violence and wailing.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.978
A lot of them
end up that way, too.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.048
Though, I admire
your optimism.
Captain.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.850
What news from the beach?

08:02.950 --> 08:05.553
The governor's close council
and several dozen soldiers

08:05.619 --> 08:07.621
have managed to
secure themselves
inside the fort.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.857
Eleanor Guthrie,
is she among them?
She is.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.759
And she sent a note.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.594
She sent it?

08:13.694 --> 08:16.163
She's taken charge
of them all already?

08:16.263 --> 08:18.098
It's an offer of an exchange.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.635
20 of our men captured
during the invasion

08:21.735 --> 08:25.606
and held in the fort for Max.

08:26.774 --> 08:27.908
20 men following orders

08:28.008 --> 08:29.318
would make
a big difference out there.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.945
I agree.
Unfortunately,
I don't think we have Max.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.813
Do we have Max?

08:33.914 --> 08:36.183
Does anyone know where she is?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.621
All right. Grab some men.
Set about finding her.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.191
She's not in the fort.
She couldn't have
gotten very far.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.595
And Billy?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.768
Where is Billy?

08:54.868 --> 08:55.969
I couldn't say.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.705
I saw some of his men
by the beach,

08:57.805 --> 09:01.174
but I assumed
we were keeping
our distance from them.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.476
Keeping our distance?

09:03.611 --> 09:07.314
He's stolen the army
that pledged its
allegiance to us,

09:07.414 --> 09:08.916
not to mention
the damaged he's caused

09:09.016 --> 09:11.284
with our alliance
to the slave communities
on this island.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.623
There are a thousand men
out there who've been
awaiting my arrival.

09:15.689 --> 09:20.260
They're now armed and angry
and I haven't yet said
a word to them.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.797
If the first five are,
"Billy Bones has crossed you,"

09:23.897 --> 09:26.133
would you care to guess
what happens next?

09:27.635 --> 09:29.703
Go out there
and put forth the word.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.639
If Billy isn't in this room
within the hour,

09:31.705 --> 09:35.709
I promise him he will regret it.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.781
You heard him.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.638
Sails!

10:04.738 --> 10:06.840
South-southwest!

10:15.983 --> 10:17.317
Heading north.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.552
She's coming from Nassau.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.722
A boat that small
headed to open water?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.327
Set a course
to intercept her.
Aye, sir.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.333
Coming aboard.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.536
Mr. Rawls!

10:36.737 --> 10:38.171
Governor.
Thank you.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.140
You've no idea
how grateful we are
to see you.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.641
What happened in Nassau?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.778
The pirates, they took it.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.848
They killed him,
Captain Berringer,
right in the square.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.217
Slit his throat on the gallows.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.853
We just barely escaped
before it was all overrun.

10:52.953 --> 10:56.323
Gloucestershire,
has she departed yet?
Sir?

10:56.423 --> 10:59.335
My ship in the harbor,
the one that was to depart
for Philadelphia with my wife,

10:59.359 --> 11:01.194
was she still there
when you left?

11:07.935 --> 11:10.070
I am about to
make haste to Nassau.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.715
I cannot afford
to tow that sloop along.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.339
You will take her
and sail for Port Royal

11:13.406 --> 11:15.852
where you will deliver
the prisoners in her hold
to Governor Addison and his men.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.078
Do you understand?
I... I could send
Mr. Chase, sir...

11:18.178 --> 11:19.880
I would like
for it to be you,
Lieutenant.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.758
There are 42 pirates
in the belly of that ship

11:21.782 --> 11:23.793
and I can spare no more
than a handful of men
to see to her.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.019
I beg your pardon, my Lord.
I want to be a part...

11:26.119 --> 11:27.797
I understand you wanna
be part of the fight
that's coming.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.833
I understand
you want retribution
for Captain Berringer.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.868
Right now, the successful
transfer of those prisoners

11:31.892 --> 11:34.061
is what I need from you.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.963
Do you understand me?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.831
Yes, my Lord.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.967
There's a fight

12:14.067 --> 12:16.269
soon to be underway in Nassau.

12:17.504 --> 12:22.142
A fight that we are
entitled to be a part of.

12:23.811 --> 12:27.047
A fight to answer
a cowardly crime.

12:27.147 --> 12:32.019
A fight
that's been stolen from us

12:32.119 --> 12:35.355
by you fucking people.

12:37.457 --> 12:41.061
So, the way I see it,

12:41.161 --> 12:45.432
each one of you owes us a fight.

12:46.834 --> 12:47.835
And Mr. Milton...

12:50.170 --> 12:51.939
is here to collect.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.249
Excuse me.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.683
Still reports coming in.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.218
Gonna need more muskets!

13:08.555 --> 13:11.925
I think we're all properly angry

13:12.025 --> 13:13.693
about what he did
on the Underhill estate.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.896
What he did?
Yes.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.367
But a very wise woman
recently told me

13:20.467 --> 13:23.403
that one should not allow
their personal feelings

13:23.503 --> 13:25.705
to cloud the reality
of the situation,

13:25.873 --> 13:27.941
which in both
that case and this...

13:29.242 --> 13:33.146
is that Billy
has influence that
is best not ignored.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.883
That sounds like good advice.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.987
Was it given before
or after he tried to
kill the two of you?

13:41.288 --> 13:42.956
Here he comes.

14:07.314 --> 14:11.084
The Boyd brothers
launched a raid on one of
the governor's munition stores.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.221
We just managed to put it down.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.533
I think we can all agree
it helps none of us

14:17.557 --> 14:19.927
to have those idiots
armed to the teeth.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.562
Yeah.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.236
Lest you think
I've been avoiding you.

14:29.336 --> 14:32.105
We've had
our hands full out there,

14:32.205 --> 14:35.008
trying to manage the transition.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.244
That's good.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.080
Though, uh,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.649
I think we ought to discuss...

14:44.017 --> 14:46.453
what it's a transition to.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.957
Certainly.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.993
Where would you like to begin?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.028
What happened on that estate?

14:56.629 --> 14:59.967
Was the aftermath
not what we feared?

15:11.044 --> 15:14.814
As it will be difficult
to fully defend Nassau

15:14.982 --> 15:18.518
without the assistance
of the slave communities
of this island,

15:18.618 --> 15:22.589
as our relationship
with those communities

15:22.689 --> 15:26.793
is likely severely damaged
as a result of this,

15:26.994 --> 15:28.661
it will be critical

15:28.761 --> 15:32.165
that she proceed
to the estate at once

15:32.265 --> 15:34.667
and attempt to repair
that relationship

15:34.767 --> 15:37.337
to whatever extent is possible.

15:37.437 --> 15:41.341
Can we trust
that you will guarantee

15:41.441 --> 15:44.011
she will be
received there safely?

15:46.146 --> 15:49.016
'Course we can.

15:50.017 --> 15:53.120
Of course Billy
would never violate

15:53.220 --> 15:56.089
the trust I place in him
as a brother...

15:57.690 --> 15:59.192
as a friend,

15:59.292 --> 16:03.230
to allow harm to come
to those closest to me.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.033
For if Billy

16:06.066 --> 16:09.336
were to do something
as disloyal as that,

16:09.436 --> 16:11.638
he knows I'd stop at nothing

16:11.738 --> 16:14.441
to see that offense
repaid against him.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.609
I will see to it.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.112
I should fucking hope so.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.582
Is everyone feeling better...

16:25.052 --> 16:27.187
now they've got that
off their chests?

16:30.590 --> 16:33.893
I ask as I'm wondering
when would be a good time

16:34.061 --> 16:35.528
for us to talk about Max.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.666
What about her?

16:39.766 --> 16:43.136
You don't think
there's anything going on
in Nassau right now

16:43.236 --> 16:45.072
that I don't know about, do you?

16:47.274 --> 16:49.342
I'm aware of
the prisoner exchange

16:49.442 --> 16:51.344
offered by the holdouts
in the fort.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.745
Meaning what?

16:54.081 --> 16:56.116
You're going to
help us find her?

16:56.216 --> 16:58.151
Find her?

17:01.421 --> 17:03.323
I have her.

17:10.430 --> 17:14.101
I am responsible

17:14.166 --> 17:18.171
for delivering all 42 of you
to the law in Port Royal.

17:20.107 --> 17:23.143
Let me dispel that notion
for you right away.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.114
It won't be happening.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.318
I assume there is
some token number

17:31.418 --> 17:34.821
I must actually deliver
for appearance's sake.

17:34.921 --> 17:38.591
How many that is
I... I honestly couldn't say.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.468
You're the captain
now that Teach is dead, yes?

17:49.836 --> 17:52.172
I am.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.507
Then you choose.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.845
Choose?

17:58.945 --> 18:03.416
Which of your men
is going to be the first?

18:05.452 --> 18:07.520
Fuck you.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.660
You choose...

18:15.395 --> 18:17.364
or it starts
with your partner here.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.677
Mr. Carver.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.356
Come on!
Ah!

19:59.332 --> 20:00.900
Who's next?

20:18.351 --> 20:20.119
We'd found her
with a small escort,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.889
trying to move her
up to the fort, I assume.

20:25.592 --> 20:30.497
If you want her,
I think there are some things
we ought to discuss first

20:30.597 --> 20:33.400
about our transition.

20:35.302 --> 20:38.938
And I think
it would be for the best
if it was just you and I.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.290
I'm walking
out of here with her.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.659
To whatever extent you think
you have leverage enough

20:59.759 --> 21:01.794
to extort
something from me over it...

21:03.029 --> 21:04.697
I'd reconsider.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.134
Five minutes.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.337
Five minutes?

21:10.403 --> 21:12.605
You listen to
what I have to say
for five minutes

21:12.705 --> 21:14.173
and she's yours.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.942
Do we have a deal?

21:18.811 --> 21:21.581
Clock's ticking.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.454
Have you stopped to ask yourself

21:27.554 --> 21:29.456
why they want her so badly?

21:29.556 --> 21:32.759
Because when I first heard
what happened in the harbor,

21:32.859 --> 21:36.195
I knew it couldn't have been
Featherstone that fucked us.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.764
He's been with us from the start

21:37.864 --> 21:40.199
and he wouldn't
have had the nerve
to cross me like that.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.569
So, I knew it had to be
someone else,

21:42.669 --> 21:44.637
someone in proximity to him.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.206
Someone bold enough
to want to cross us

21:47.374 --> 21:49.576
and dangerous enough
to follow through.

21:50.843 --> 21:55.448
So, from there, the list
got very short very quickly.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.884
Max fucked us.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.388
If it wasn't for her,
we likely take Nassau whole,

22:01.454 --> 22:04.524
fleet intact,
no prisoners in the fort,

22:04.624 --> 22:07.394
no fight between you and I.

22:08.961 --> 22:12.865
Instead, here we are.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.536
Now, one would think

22:16.636 --> 22:18.914
we could go a long way
towards soothing all
that chaos out there

22:18.938 --> 22:20.573
and the anger driving it

22:20.673 --> 22:22.409
if we could
draw everyone together

22:22.475 --> 22:25.011
to see justice
done to the one
responsible for all of it.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.146
All of it?
Enough of it.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.418
Did they not hold
their trials in her tavern?

22:31.484 --> 22:34.253
Did she not finance
the regime directly?

22:34.421 --> 22:36.101
You don't think
I could sell that
out there?

22:36.188 --> 22:38.257
Because Eleanor Guthrie
knows I could.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.126
That's why
the first thing
she asked for

22:40.226 --> 22:43.530
the moment those gates
closed behind her was Max.

22:43.630 --> 22:46.699
That's how valuable
she could be to us.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.769
And you wanna
trade that away
for 20 men?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.972
Those 20 men are your brothers.

22:53.072 --> 22:56.843
Those men's lives
mean as much to me
as they do to you.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.747
And I assure you

23:00.847 --> 23:04.451
they mean a hell
of a lot more to me
than they do to Flint.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.285
You know as well as I do

23:06.453 --> 23:07.854
the only reason
he wants them free

23:07.954 --> 23:10.457
is because the only soldiers
in town are mine

23:10.490 --> 23:12.735
and the prisoners in the fort
are likely to still follow his...

23:12.759 --> 23:15.027
I'm going to stop you
right there.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.664
From the moment you began
concocting this story,

23:17.764 --> 23:20.767
I knew it was with an eye
towards pushing him out.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.703
Separating the two of us
so you can...
The two of you?

23:23.803 --> 23:26.639
How long ago was it
that the two of us agreed

23:26.739 --> 23:29.542
that Flint threatened
to be the end of us all?

23:29.642 --> 23:32.545
That he would find ways
of driving us over
and over again

23:32.645 --> 23:35.314
into that storm
till there was none
of us left?

23:35.482 --> 23:38.718
We survived him, you and I.

23:38.818 --> 23:41.988
And now you want
to follow him into what?

23:42.088 --> 23:44.023
A massive slave revolt?

23:44.123 --> 23:46.759
A war against
the British Empire?

23:48.661 --> 23:50.797
How is this not
just the next storm

23:50.897 --> 23:53.566
in a very long line of them?

24:13.820 --> 24:17.524
You told me once that
the people he holds closest

24:17.624 --> 24:20.527
are the most at risk
of being consumed by him.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.130
And he and I have
discussed it at length.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.234
So, I thank you
for your concern.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.538
But I'm going to be just fine.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.140
And I'm not talking about you.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.544
I understand that you've
come to care for her.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.047
MADI.

24:45.251 --> 24:49.889
Be very, very careful, Billy.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.859
If anyone is at risk

24:52.959 --> 24:55.928
of being consumed
by his need for this war...

24:58.931 --> 25:01.167
it's her.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.142
Time's up.

25:21.788 --> 25:24.223
I heard you were there.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.893
What?

25:26.993 --> 25:30.296
The last time
when we ran off
the English,

25:30.597 --> 25:32.665
took control.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.635
I heard you was a navy man then.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.672
Heard you saw it all.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.275
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.645
That was a good day for me.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.914
Did a thing no one else would.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.215
Or could.

25:51.117 --> 25:55.221
Thought I'd earned a place
by Blackbeard's side
for an age.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.489
Turns out it wasn't
nearly so long

25:57.624 --> 25:59.158
as I thought it would be.

25:59.258 --> 26:02.829
Before Blackbeard decided
he could do better than me.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.735
Is there a point
you're trying to make?

26:13.305 --> 26:16.743
You're counseling
Long John Silver
to be reasonable.

26:16.843 --> 26:17.977
Hmm?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.646
To do what you want him to do

26:19.712 --> 26:21.648
instead of what he wants to do.

26:21.714 --> 26:26.252
Just wondering
how long you think
he'll suffer it

26:26.352 --> 26:29.188
before he decides
he can do better than you.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.731
Go get her now.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.468
What the hell happened in there?

26:42.702 --> 26:44.503
We won.

26:44.671 --> 26:45.905
That's all that matters.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.697
There will be no mission
to Philadelphia.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.300
I assume that much
is clear by now.

27:24.076 --> 27:27.313
Our chances of success there
were slim to begin with.

27:29.716 --> 27:33.119
That the idea
that I might stand
in front of my grandfather

27:33.219 --> 27:36.723
and suggest that Nassau
is still a viable concern
worthy of his investment

27:36.789 --> 27:39.425
when refugees
are fleeing in droves...

27:40.727 --> 27:43.295
planters face a revolt
of their laborers...

27:44.931 --> 27:48.167
and men with swords
murder wantonly
in the streets.

27:49.936 --> 27:52.604
Oh, Christ.

27:52.739 --> 27:55.942
I am right back where I started.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.747
Every fight I have ever won...

28:01.814 --> 28:03.750
every death I have escaped,

28:03.783 --> 28:06.753
every sacrifice
I have had bled out of me,

28:06.853 --> 28:08.287
it will all have to be repeated

28:08.387 --> 28:11.123
just to get things
back to where they were
a few hours ago.

28:11.223 --> 28:14.761
There's some kind of hell
it seems to me to be.

28:21.067 --> 28:24.937
But I want you to know,
at the first opportunity,

28:25.037 --> 28:27.639
I will see you
returned back home.

28:27.774 --> 28:31.477
I gave you my word.
I intend to honor it.

28:31.577 --> 28:34.981
This fight ahead
does not belong to you,
nor to your children.

28:35.081 --> 28:38.150
I won't have you bear
any more of it.

28:53.966 --> 28:56.235
Would you consider joining me?

28:58.204 --> 29:00.406
To London?

29:02.842 --> 29:04.811
You have been
living in our home
for some time now.

29:04.877 --> 29:08.848
I don't imagine there's much
about my husband and I
that you don't know.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.550
With the debt he owes,
he is going to be
fighting this fight

29:11.818 --> 29:12.985
for the rest of his life.

29:13.085 --> 29:16.823
And for as long as he
is chained to this place,

29:16.889 --> 29:17.890
then I am as well.

29:19.391 --> 29:22.461
I wonder, ma'am,
if he might want you
to leave.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.832
Especially when he learns

29:25.898 --> 29:29.335
of your current state of being.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.343
I beg your pardon, ma'am,

29:37.443 --> 29:40.346
but seeing what I see
in your service...

29:41.848 --> 29:44.250
I fear there are things
I may know about you

29:44.350 --> 29:46.518
that even the governor
does not yet know.

30:01.433 --> 30:05.004
I have grown
quite fond of you, ma'am.

30:07.106 --> 30:11.710
You are someone who is
determined to be better today
than you were yesterday.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.513
And in this world,
that is in short supply.

30:15.982 --> 30:19.285
And so I find myself
feeling protective of you.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.256
And if I am feeling that way,

30:24.356 --> 30:28.194
fearing the thought
of you bearing a child
in this environment...

30:30.997 --> 30:33.132
I can only imagine how concerned

30:33.232 --> 30:35.101
your husband would be.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.341
When my family
first arrived here...

30:43.842 --> 30:47.179
I remember my mother and father

30:47.279 --> 30:49.481
had a terrible argument.

30:51.450 --> 30:55.021
She told him that this was
no place for a little girl.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.124
That it was cruel.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.764
I stay,

31:05.932 --> 31:08.935
and our child is raised
amongst all this brutality.

31:11.503 --> 31:16.175
I go, and my husband
is left alone to face it
on his own.

31:19.145 --> 31:22.314
Amazing, this place.

31:22.414 --> 31:26.152
Somehow leaves
no options other than
to hurt the ones you love.

31:29.155 --> 31:32.291
Ma'am, there's a messenger
at the gate.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.393
They've agreed to the exchange.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.598
That's it!

31:39.698 --> 31:41.200
Another one now!

31:42.601 --> 31:44.536
Knock his fucking teeth out.

31:47.506 --> 31:51.043
Any man stood a chance
against him is dead.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.347
If we don't try something
they ain't expecting,

31:55.447 --> 31:57.649
then we're all fucking dead.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.387
If any of the men
who stood a chance
to beat him are dead,

32:01.487 --> 32:03.722
then what do you suggest?

32:05.124 --> 32:07.426
Any man.

32:07.526 --> 32:11.263
Absolutely...
absolutely not.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.599
The ones of us
they don't get down here,

32:13.699 --> 32:16.268
we're just gonna swing
in Port Royal in a few days.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.604
Get up. Get up!
You gotta trust me.

32:20.239 --> 32:24.210
He asks you for a name,
you don't say shit.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.446
And you let him take me.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.121
Another name, Captain.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.458
Captain?

32:39.558 --> 32:42.094
Will you be choosing or will I?

32:45.297 --> 32:47.033
All right.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.670
Her.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.192
...nice and slow.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.394
You like it rough, don't you?

33:19.265 --> 33:21.433
Make her bleed.

33:27.773 --> 33:31.577
I think she
likes you, Mr. Milton.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.579
Well, take her!

33:39.218 --> 33:41.287
Yes, my love.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.937
Get up. Get up!

33:59.138 --> 34:00.706
Ooh.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.512
On your feet. Get up!

34:10.248 --> 34:11.983
Come on, Mil,
what you waiting for?

34:12.118 --> 34:13.152
Come on, get up!

34:13.252 --> 34:14.853
On your feet.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.357
Come on, my pretty.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.737
Anne, get up.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.259
Move!

36:33.925 --> 36:37.596
I would think
some sort of thanks
might be in order.

36:37.696 --> 36:42.368
Billy was more than ready
to throw you to the wolves
out there.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.503
And to be honest,

36:44.603 --> 36:48.374
I was undecided about
whether to go through
with this deal at all.

36:48.474 --> 36:53.379
Sure, I get my men back
in exchange for you.

36:53.479 --> 36:56.715
But something tells me

36:56.815 --> 36:58.850
if I free you,

36:58.950 --> 37:02.888
you'll find a way
to be a problem for me again,

37:02.988 --> 37:05.023
and soon.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.893
Of course not.

37:07.993 --> 37:10.762
Why would I do that?

37:15.901 --> 37:18.370
When you and I
last saw each other...

37:19.905 --> 37:22.441
you had every reason
to see me killed.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.778
Certainly would've solved
a lot of problems for you.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.319
And yet you didn't.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.323
Why?

37:40.592 --> 37:42.861
You know,

37:42.961 --> 37:45.497
I've had a rough few days
owing to you.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.166
I'd be angrier about it,

37:48.334 --> 37:50.802
but I'm a little preoccupied
being angry with other people.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.774
I just asked you
a simple question.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.447
Why didn't you kill me
when you had the chance?

38:03.349 --> 38:06.452
It would have solved
some problems.

38:06.552 --> 38:11.357
It would have caused others
that I chose not to live with.

38:11.423 --> 38:15.361
What sort of problems
would it have caused?

38:16.428 --> 38:19.365
That I would have
had to live with it.

38:25.737 --> 38:29.375
You said you wished
to send me away.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.712
Somewhere where
I couldn't return.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.784
Out of curiosity,

38:38.884 --> 38:40.786
how were you planning
to manage that?

38:44.756 --> 38:47.225
When Anne was recruiting
spies in Port Royal,

38:47.393 --> 38:49.861
she met a man with an estate
in the wilderness

38:49.961 --> 38:52.030
north of Spanish Florida.

38:52.130 --> 38:55.233
A reform-minded man

38:55.401 --> 38:58.404
who uses convicts as laborers.

38:58.470 --> 39:02.674
Convicts he solicits
from prisons in England

39:02.774 --> 39:07.245
where their treatment
is far less humane.

39:07.413 --> 39:10.449
This man, we were told,
found it profitable

39:10.549 --> 39:13.251
to offer his services
to wealthy families,

39:13.419 --> 39:16.555
some of the most prominent
in London on occasion,

39:16.655 --> 39:20.125
with a need to
make troublesome
family members disappear.

39:21.927 --> 39:25.296
Cared for, tended to,

39:25.431 --> 39:27.933
but never to be seen
or heard from again.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.537
What families?

39:32.738 --> 39:34.440
What families?

39:34.540 --> 39:37.776
Do you know what families
in London made use of this?

39:39.711 --> 39:41.713
I have no idea.

39:45.016 --> 39:47.453
They're ready.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.426
Billy told me I should worry

40:28.527 --> 40:31.329
that you will be Madi's end.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.566
That's all he wanted
in exchange for Max.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.102
For me to sit still...

40:38.537 --> 40:40.071
while he warned me
that your commitment

40:40.171 --> 40:42.874
to the greatest
possible victory
in this war of ours...

40:44.543 --> 40:48.113
would consume her
and eventually lead
to her death.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.583
Well, that's a smart thing
for him to say

40:51.683 --> 40:53.619
if his intent
is to split us apart.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.623
I suppose we should've
expected nothing less.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.429
Do I need to be concerned

41:04.530 --> 41:07.533
that you took
almost two hours
to tell me about it?

41:09.167 --> 41:12.003
We are at our least rational...

41:13.539 --> 41:15.541
when we're
at our most vulnerable.

41:17.275 --> 41:19.010
If nothing else,
this is a good reminder

41:19.110 --> 41:21.412
that without a doubt

41:21.547 --> 41:24.883
she is the point at which
I'm my most vulnerable.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.556
The thought of losing her...

41:35.193 --> 41:36.862
I see.

41:39.798 --> 41:44.135
If we assume
that we are on the verge

41:44.235 --> 41:47.238
of some impossible victory here,

41:47.338 --> 41:49.741
a truly significant thing...

41:51.142 --> 41:54.913
if we assume that is real
and here for the taking...

41:56.982 --> 42:00.686
wouldn't you trade it all
to have Thomas Hamilton
back again?

42:05.991 --> 42:08.226
I think if he knew
how close we were

42:08.326 --> 42:11.229
to the victory
he gave his life to achieve...

42:12.698 --> 42:14.733
he wouldn't want me to.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.670
I see.

42:20.071 --> 42:22.841
Though, that wasn't really
what I asked, was it?

42:26.277 --> 42:30.616
Assume his father was
just as dark as you say,

42:30.649 --> 42:35.220
but was unable
to murder his own son,

42:35.320 --> 42:37.989
assume he found a way

42:38.089 --> 42:40.225
to secret Thomas
away from London...
He didn't.

42:43.829 --> 42:47.032
Would you trade this war
to make it so?

42:50.836 --> 42:52.738
It is some kind of hell

42:52.838 --> 42:56.875
to be forced to choose
one irreplaceable thing
over another.

42:58.844 --> 43:03.048
And while Billy's
motive to separate us
is painfully transparent,

43:03.148 --> 43:05.216
it took me two hours
to tell you about it

43:05.316 --> 43:08.987
because try as I may
to get the conversation
out of my head...

43:11.322 --> 43:14.660
I just can't seem to do it.

43:16.795 --> 43:18.697
The closer we get to
the end of this journey,

43:18.797 --> 43:21.199
the more the contradictions
will accumulate...

43:23.935 --> 43:26.772
confusing issues
we once thought were clear.

43:29.374 --> 43:31.877
I suppose the good news is
that's how we'll know

43:31.977 --> 43:34.245
we're finally getting
somewhere interesting.

43:35.714 --> 43:38.116
- All clear!
- Clear the fort!

43:57.836 --> 43:59.705
Close the gate!

44:35.440 --> 44:37.442
What can I do for you, ma'am?

44:42.113 --> 44:44.816
Why are they still in chains?

44:44.916 --> 44:47.819
We freed the ones
that understood we came
as friends here,

44:47.919 --> 44:49.821
not as enemies.

44:51.489 --> 44:53.825
But some, it seemed,
bore us ill will

44:53.925 --> 44:56.361
over some of the consequences
of our victory here.

45:06.772 --> 45:08.106
You have to know

45:08.206 --> 45:10.608
it is important to ask
to repair the alliance

45:10.776 --> 45:12.811
between Captain Flint's
people and ours.

45:12.911 --> 45:15.246
Important to me.

45:16.381 --> 45:17.783
After you fled,

45:17.849 --> 45:20.151
the pirates sent warnings
to the other estates

45:20.251 --> 45:22.921
that any violence
done to the slaves

45:23.021 --> 45:25.056
in their possession
for what happened here

45:25.156 --> 45:26.992
would be answered.

45:31.863 --> 45:35.333
The next morning,
an answer was left
by the gate.

45:35.433 --> 45:38.036
A sack filled with fingers.

45:40.305 --> 45:42.073
White fingers.

45:45.643 --> 45:48.446
Reprisals were visited
upon our loved ones

45:48.546 --> 45:50.315
upon the Edwards estate.

45:51.850 --> 45:54.352
Reprisals of the cruelest kind

45:54.452 --> 45:57.022
intended to instill fear,

45:57.122 --> 45:58.824
break spirits,

45:58.890 --> 46:00.658
reassert control.

46:00.826 --> 46:03.194
It did not have
the intended effect.

46:07.866 --> 46:09.234
They revolted.

46:09.334 --> 46:12.037
One of the men there started it.

46:13.138 --> 46:15.106
A man named Julius.

46:16.407 --> 46:18.844
Now he's forming
an army out there,

46:18.910 --> 46:22.147
organizing, building strength,

46:22.247 --> 46:26.317
an army with designs
on taking and holding Nassau.

46:29.020 --> 46:31.556
But with as much anger
towards the pirates

46:31.656 --> 46:35.060
and anyone who would
call himself friend
to a pirate

46:35.160 --> 46:37.528
as they do towards the English.

46:41.967 --> 46:44.169
That is why they are
still in chains,

46:44.269 --> 46:47.538
out of fear that
they might rise up
and join Julius's army

46:47.638 --> 46:49.707
before ever submitting to yours.

46:49.875 --> 46:51.409
We tried to prevent
the reprisals

46:51.509 --> 46:52.709
the moment we learned of them,

46:52.878 --> 46:54.112
Captain Flint and I.

46:54.212 --> 46:56.381
They must know that.
They know.

46:56.481 --> 46:59.317
But they also know that
when it comes to these men,

46:59.417 --> 47:02.220
neither you nor Captain Flint
are fully in control of them.

47:05.290 --> 47:08.126
Then we will
get control of them.

47:09.627 --> 47:13.364
You must see by now
that when you wage war
on the world,

47:13.464 --> 47:15.233
the world fights back.

47:16.902 --> 47:18.403
Your mother knew that.

47:19.570 --> 47:21.072
Knew that the best one can do

47:21.172 --> 47:23.441
is to find a place
you can protect,

47:23.541 --> 47:27.178
build a wall,
and save who you can.

47:27.278 --> 47:30.381
You'd be wise to learn
from her example.

47:47.999 --> 47:50.768
I'm sorry for
what happened today.

47:50.936 --> 47:53.038
The moment I realized
what was about to happen,

47:53.138 --> 47:55.140
I sent men to find you.

48:00.045 --> 48:03.314
I'm just thankful we were
able to get you in time.

48:03.414 --> 48:07.518
You are sorry...

48:07.618 --> 48:10.455
for what happened today.

48:12.190 --> 48:14.592
What happened today

48:14.692 --> 48:17.963
was exactly what I have been
warning you about

48:18.063 --> 48:21.866
from the moment
you and your husband
first arrived here.

48:21.967 --> 48:26.871
Again and again and again.

48:26.972 --> 48:29.474
That the decisions
you made at every turn

48:29.574 --> 48:32.077
would eventually
lead us to this.

48:33.578 --> 48:38.316
Everything I have
is gone because of it.

48:40.986 --> 48:43.088
If you wish to apologize,

48:43.188 --> 48:48.026
what happened today
does not begin to cover it.

48:53.264 --> 48:55.100
Where would we have gone?

48:57.002 --> 48:59.337
What?

49:01.006 --> 49:04.409
A long time ago, you asked me
to leave Nassau with you

49:04.509 --> 49:06.177
to avoid ruin.

49:06.277 --> 49:09.080
If I had said yes,
where would we have gone?

49:10.515 --> 49:12.683
I have no idea.

49:14.352 --> 49:17.022
I was so close to saying yes.

49:18.523 --> 49:20.625
There were good reasons
to say yes

49:20.725 --> 49:24.029
and I heard it in my mind,

49:24.095 --> 49:27.032
tried to speak it
over and over again.

49:27.098 --> 49:30.368
But when the moment
finally came...

49:33.038 --> 49:36.141
I had put so much of myself
into this place,

49:36.241 --> 49:40.045
in that moment,
I honestly didn't know
where I ended and it began.

49:42.747 --> 49:47.118
There may be ways
of severing oneself
in that way...

49:49.054 --> 49:52.523
sacrificing one part
to save the other.

49:54.259 --> 49:57.528
But in that moment...

50:00.265 --> 50:04.302
I honestly couldn't find
something sharp enough
to make the cut.

50:08.005 --> 50:11.008
What would have been enough?

50:20.585 --> 50:23.088
I truly am sorry.

50:24.155 --> 50:26.657
For all of it.

50:26.757 --> 50:30.228
If there was a way
I could make things right here,

50:30.328 --> 50:32.163
I'd do it.

50:34.465 --> 50:39.304
But now, given everything
you have seen here
in recent months...

50:40.771 --> 50:43.208
can you honestly say
that you believe

50:43.308 --> 50:45.743
that Nassau will ever really be
what you wanted it to be?

50:50.481 --> 50:53.251
Neither can I.

50:56.654 --> 51:00.825
But there may be
a way that we can
take something from it...

51:02.393 --> 51:04.462
if you'll help me.

51:07.765 --> 51:09.300
What is it?

51:09.400 --> 51:11.602
Sails have been spotted
on the horizon.

51:11.702 --> 51:13.238
Sails?

51:13.338 --> 51:15.640
Whose sails?

51:21.912 --> 51:25.150
The Revenge?
Are we certain?

51:25.183 --> 51:27.051
She's a man-of-war
and she approaches

51:27.152 --> 51:29.220
from Captain Teach's
last sighted position.

51:30.321 --> 51:32.657
If it were Teach returning,

51:32.757 --> 51:35.626
wouldn't he be
flying his banner
as he approached?

51:38.163 --> 51:40.165
Sails on the horizon!

51:45.336 --> 51:46.871
They are saying
there are no signs

51:46.971 --> 51:49.207
of a prize ship
anywhere on the water.

51:49.307 --> 51:51.309
So, at least it is unlikely

51:51.409 --> 51:54.879
Captain Teach caught
the governor's sloop
before returning.

51:54.979 --> 51:57.848
Teach would never
have given up so quickly.

51:59.350 --> 52:01.186
If it is his ship,

52:01.219 --> 52:04.622
then in all likelihood,
the governor's ship
was captured.

52:04.722 --> 52:07.192
Ma'am?

52:07.258 --> 52:10.195
Perhaps you would like
to wait below

52:10.228 --> 52:14.199
in case the news
is not what we hope.

52:14.265 --> 52:15.766
She's raising a banner.

52:17.535 --> 52:19.204
British colors.

52:19.237 --> 52:21.306
She's flying
the governor's banner!

52:22.440 --> 52:24.642
And those are his signs!

52:24.742 --> 52:26.444
It's him!

52:47.832 --> 52:49.600
Make a course towards the fort.

52:51.269 --> 52:52.503
As close as we can get.

52:52.603 --> 52:54.539
Ready the men.

52:54.639 --> 52:56.450
We'll make our landing
under cover of the fort's guns,

52:56.474 --> 52:58.609
reinforce them,
and move to retake Nassau.

53:08.486 --> 53:10.154
Ma'am?

53:10.255 --> 53:12.257
Shall I begin moving
the guns to the beach?

53:14.492 --> 53:15.760
Yes.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.362
Yes, of course.

53:17.462 --> 53:19.430
Let me know when it's done.

53:28.339 --> 53:30.441
Heave!

53:30.541 --> 53:32.677
Heave!

53:32.777 --> 53:35.112
Ready?

53:35.280 --> 53:38.383
They will all be preparing
for the fight ahead of us.

53:38.483 --> 53:42.653
Would you like to tell me
what it is you are
preparing to do?

53:55.466 --> 53:57.735
An hour, maybe less,

53:57.835 --> 53:59.946
until his guns are
in range of the beach
and he starts his landing.

53:59.970 --> 54:01.639
Once he can bring
his broadsides to bear

54:01.739 --> 54:03.140
in concert
with the fort's power,

54:03.308 --> 54:05.343
it'll be hard to keep
his men off the sand.

54:06.444 --> 54:08.112
Do we need to consider
falling back?

54:08.379 --> 54:09.647
No.

54:09.747 --> 54:12.383
If we leave Nassau now,
we may never get her back.

54:14.819 --> 54:16.854
My men can defend this beach.

54:25.896 --> 54:26.997
We'll have the numbers.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.399
The first barrage, maybe.

54:28.499 --> 54:30.401
But as soon as those soldiers
hit the beach,

54:30.501 --> 54:32.503
nine in 10 of ours will flee.

54:32.603 --> 54:35.806
With Nassau at stake,
that's not a gamble
I'm willing to take.

54:35.906 --> 54:37.508
What choice do we have?

54:37.608 --> 54:39.777
Well, that's
a very good question.

55:30.461 --> 55:32.697
Should this fight above us
come to pass,

55:32.797 --> 55:36.901
at best, the outcome
is not certain.

55:37.001 --> 55:39.504
But what is certain

55:39.604 --> 55:42.740
is that many will die
and much will be lost.

55:45.610 --> 55:47.812
I think we've all seen
our fair share of loss

55:47.912 --> 55:49.714
and I have had enough of it.

55:51.416 --> 55:55.019
So, I'd like to ensure
that this fight does not
come to pass.

55:56.153 --> 55:58.322
How do you suggest we do that?

55:58.423 --> 56:02.427
I am prepared to surrender
the governor's remaining
forces to you...

56:02.527 --> 56:04.562
control of the fort,

56:04.662 --> 56:06.263
its guns, its magazine,

56:06.431 --> 56:09.199
the unconditional release
of the remainder of
your prisoners.

56:09.434 --> 56:11.101
All of it.

56:11.201 --> 56:13.137
You're prepared
to do all of that?

56:13.438 --> 56:14.505
Yes.

56:15.606 --> 56:17.642
In exchange for what?

56:19.209 --> 56:22.246
In exchange for the cache.

56:25.616 --> 56:28.953
The chest with the remains
of the Urca treasure.

56:29.053 --> 56:30.855
I'm told it is hidden

56:30.955 --> 56:34.725
buried in a secret place
known only to Captain Rackham
and the two of you.

56:36.461 --> 56:38.328
I get the cache

56:38.463 --> 56:41.224
and guaranteed safe passage
off the island for everyone
in this fort...

56:42.933 --> 56:45.102
and you get Nassau.

56:45.202 --> 56:47.738
The money isn't ours to give.

56:48.939 --> 56:51.175
We have partners
who would almost certainly

56:51.275 --> 56:53.578
rather fight this out
than lose their treasury.

56:53.678 --> 56:56.547
Your partners are your problem.

56:56.647 --> 56:58.849
There is a reason
why I invited you here
and not them.

56:58.949 --> 57:02.219
As soon as the governor's ship
is in range of the beach,

57:02.487 --> 57:04.689
this offer disappears.

57:04.789 --> 57:08.626
I will not
undermine his position
once the shooting starts.

57:10.661 --> 57:13.864
So, right now in this moment,

57:15.500 --> 57:16.767
what do you want to do?

57:21.138 --> 57:22.640
How?

57:23.708 --> 57:25.976
How would you see it done?

57:26.076 --> 57:27.978
One of you surrenders himself

57:28.078 --> 57:31.816
and remains here
to ensure these terms
are honored.

57:33.518 --> 57:35.028
You send someone
to retrieve the cache,

57:35.052 --> 57:37.822
and once it arrives,
I take possession of it.

57:37.922 --> 57:40.224
And my people exit the fort

57:40.324 --> 57:42.292
to a transport waiting
to take us away from here.

57:42.527 --> 57:44.294
The answer is no.

57:44.529 --> 57:47.131
Absolutely no.

57:47.231 --> 57:49.199
If she thought
she could win this fight,

57:49.299 --> 57:51.636
why would she be offering
to sell the victory to us

57:51.736 --> 57:53.170
even for a fortune?

57:58.776 --> 58:00.978
I have had enough of this.

58:02.647 --> 58:05.816
And I am ready for it to end.

58:11.922 --> 58:13.758
No.

58:17.628 --> 58:19.229
Trust me.
