MAN:
    <i>Look, you're wrong, Ned.</i>

01:16.642 --> 01:19.110
<i>What we're selling is</i>
    <i>the Broadway experience.</i>

01:19.177 --> 01:21.512
We want the out-of-towners
and the average man

01:21.580 --> 01:22.980
to buy those tickets,

01:23.048 --> 01:25.450
and those people want
to see an orchestra in the pit.

01:25.518 --> 01:27.619
Those people don't care
         where the orchestra is.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.788
They probably don't
          even know where it is.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.289
Here, I'll show you.

01:31.357 --> 01:32.824
Excuse me, cabbie?
                            Hmm?

01:32.892 --> 01:34.859
This man's a producer,
        I'm a director,

01:34.927 --> 01:37.028
and we want
     to ask you a question.

01:37.096 --> 01:39.331
Have you ever been
        to the theater?

01:39.398 --> 01:40.699
Yeah, I think I have.

01:40.766 --> 01:41.866
MAN
Terrific.

01:41.934 --> 01:43.034
All right, now,

01:43.102 --> 01:45.904
did you notice where
            the music came from?

01:45.971 --> 01:47.639
I don't mean
               the singers, now,

01:47.706 --> 01:50.975
I mean the musical
                    instruments.

01:51.043 --> 01:55.013
Yeah, the musical instruments.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.981
Like in <i>No Strings,</i>

01:57.049 --> 01:58.516
where they eliminated
          the violins

01:58.584 --> 02:00.818
and put the brass and
 the woodwinds right on stage,

02:00.886 --> 02:03.054
whereas in <i>Man of La Mancha,</i>
    they put them backstage,

02:03.122 --> 02:04.656
separated
     between the two wings.

02:04.723 --> 02:06.524
And of course, there
          was that wonderful way

02:06.592 --> 02:07.825
that Andrei Serban

02:07.893 --> 02:09.160
orchestrated
                 the instruments

02:09.228 --> 02:11.729
and the human voices
           placed within the set

02:11.797 --> 02:14.399
in his Greek Trilogy
         at the La MaMa theater.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.702
Uh, are you an actor?

02:17.770 --> 02:19.036
Who? Me?
Alex?

02:19.104 --> 02:20.705
No, no, no, I'm
               just a cab driver

02:20.772 --> 02:22.007
who happens to
               love the theater.

02:22.074 --> 02:23.174
Uh-huh.

02:23.242 --> 02:24.609
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

02:24.676 --> 02:27.479
when I was younger,
I wanted to work in the theater.

02:27.547 --> 02:30.548
I'd have done anything
just to get my foot in the door.

02:30.616 --> 02:32.650
You know, we're interviewing
for gofers tomorrow.

02:32.718 --> 02:35.086
It's too bad
you're not 20 years younger.

02:35.154 --> 02:36.387
Well, wait a minute.

02:36.455 --> 02:39.156
I like to think a man
is never too old to be a flunky.

02:41.326 --> 02:44.129
As a matter of fact, you know,
     if the hours were flexible,

02:44.196 --> 02:45.330
you know,
                   I could be...

02:45.397 --> 02:47.465
Alex, Alex... no.

02:47.533 --> 02:48.866
Oh, okay.

02:48.934 --> 02:50.535
I understand.

02:50.602 --> 02:52.704
It was worth asking anyway.

02:58.310 --> 02:59.910
Latka?

02:59.978 --> 03:01.679
Simka, just go home.

03:01.747 --> 03:05.182
You shouldn't go to
          work when you're sick.

03:05.250 --> 03:08.653
Look, we cannot afford
      to lose a day's pay.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.055
And besides,
   I'm not really that sick.

03:11.123 --> 03:14.025
Well, let me just see if
    you have a fever, all right?

03:14.093 --> 03:15.860
All right.
                     Let me see.

03:15.928 --> 03:17.495
You're burning up!

03:17.563 --> 03:18.763
I am not.

03:18.831 --> 03:21.099
That's a raging inferno!

03:21.166 --> 03:24.035
Jim, tell me if you
           think he has a fever.

03:24.102 --> 03:26.471
Feel his...
                  feel his head.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.840
Tony?

03:28.908 --> 03:31.743
Tony... Tony,

03:31.810 --> 03:33.711
do you think
                 he has a fever?

03:37.616 --> 03:39.551
Something terrible
has just happened.

03:39.618 --> 03:40.985
TONY & SIMKA:
                          What?!

03:41.053 --> 03:43.287
I've forgotten
why I'm doing this.

03:46.191 --> 03:47.359
He's hot.

03:47.426 --> 03:48.926
He's hot.

03:48.994 --> 03:51.630
You cannot work
               when you're sick.

03:51.697 --> 03:52.830
Oh... all right.

03:52.898 --> 03:55.800
Go ask your boss for
           a day off, all right?

03:55.867 --> 03:57.601
Okay.
                          Louie?

03:57.669 --> 04:00.038
Louie?!

04:00.105 --> 04:01.505
(shouting):
                Louie!

04:01.573 --> 04:03.674
LOUIE:
                   Take it easy!

04:03.742 --> 04:05.710
You're gonna crack a windshield.

04:05.778 --> 04:07.712
Louie...

04:08.780 --> 04:10.782
...I don't
feel very well.

04:10.849 --> 04:14.118
My wife, that I love
very much, is-is upset

04:14.186 --> 04:16.954
because I'm risking
my health to work here.

04:17.022 --> 04:19.891
You know, for-for
over three years,

04:19.958 --> 04:21.993
I have not had
a-a day off

04:22.060 --> 04:24.495
from backbreaking labor.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.264
So, could-could I...

04:26.332 --> 04:28.299
Could I please
have the day off?

04:29.935 --> 04:31.035
I don't know.

04:32.338 --> 04:35.306
Now, what are you
     worried about, Latka?

04:35.374 --> 04:37.041
This is America.

04:37.109 --> 04:40.144
We got a thing here
                called sick pay.

04:40.212 --> 04:41.845
Oh!
Oh, good, good.

04:41.913 --> 04:43.615
You pay me ten bucks,
                you can go home.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.818
Louie...

04:46.886 --> 04:48.086
Never mind, Latka.

04:48.153 --> 04:49.353
Louie!

04:55.761 --> 04:58.696
Now we cannot
                      get cable.

05:04.103 --> 05:07.105
Now, we have neglected this
long enough.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.706
You are gonna go home.

05:08.774 --> 05:10.942
You're gonna drink lots
of liquids.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.811
You're gonna take aspirin

05:12.878 --> 05:15.245
and go right to bed
with a pumpkin.

05:17.683 --> 05:19.116
No, uh-uh.

05:19.184 --> 05:23.221
I... I'm afraid I'm gonna have
     to destroy this myth.

05:25.290 --> 05:28.258
I used to live
on a commune,

05:28.326 --> 05:30.261
and although

05:30.328 --> 05:34.331
those who slept with pumpkins

05:34.399 --> 05:37.302
did, in fact,
    seem to be healthier...

05:40.673 --> 05:44.609
...so did those that slept
  with many other vegetables.

05:46.445 --> 05:47.845
ALEX: ...not the point.
           ELAINE: I don't know.

05:47.913 --> 05:48.913
I know, I know.

05:48.980 --> 05:50.048
All I'm saying is

05:50.116 --> 05:51.549
that 20 years ago,
             I would have killed

05:51.617 --> 05:52.750
to get that
                    gofer's job.

05:52.818 --> 05:54.251
20 years ago?
        What about now?

05:54.319 --> 05:55.420
Oh, please.

05:55.487 --> 05:56.587
Tell Tony.
                           What?

05:56.655 --> 05:57.755
What?
    What?
        Listen to this.

05:57.823 --> 05:59.157
What?
            Nothing.
ELAINE:
Tell him.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.758
Nothing.
    No, it's just that I...

06:00.826 --> 06:02.627
I happened
   to ask a Broadway producer

06:02.695 --> 06:04.495
for a job as a gofer.

06:04.563 --> 06:05.730
Wow! Great! When do you start?

06:05.797 --> 06:06.998
He doesn't.
                           TONY:
                        Why not?

06:07.065 --> 06:09.800
Because the guy told him
  he was too old for the job.

06:09.868 --> 06:11.402
And you accepted that, Alex?

06:11.470 --> 06:13.237
(snickers)

06:13.305 --> 06:15.573
Haven't you seen <i>Rocky III?</i>

06:15.641 --> 06:17.442
No.

06:17.509 --> 06:19.043
Are you kidding?

06:19.111 --> 06:22.913
<i>Rocky III</i> may be the greatest
   Rocky movie since <i>Rocky I.</i>

06:22.981 --> 06:25.916
How do you tell 'em apart?

06:25.984 --> 06:27.352
They're numbered.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.786
I see.

06:28.854 --> 06:31.455
And you know what the motto
          of <i>Rocky III</i> is, Alex?

06:31.523 --> 06:33.891
Yeah, stop me before
  I make another one, please.

06:33.959 --> 06:35.492
No, no, no, no.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.694
It's "Go for it!"

06:36.762 --> 06:38.663
And he could have been talking
         to you, Alex.

06:38.730 --> 06:39.897
I don't know.

06:39.965 --> 06:41.666
Maybe I'm crazy,
      but I always thought

06:41.734 --> 06:44.568
that, uh, well, that if I had
gotten a job like that,

06:44.636 --> 06:47.071
I mean, even a gofer's job,
20 years ago,

06:47.139 --> 06:49.574
that maybe today I would have
been a Broadway producer.

06:49.642 --> 06:50.808
Alex, go for it!

06:50.876 --> 06:52.476
You know, Alex,
       I don't know much

06:52.544 --> 06:54.345
about how you move up
       in that business,

06:54.413 --> 06:56.280
but if that gofer job
could be turned into anything,

06:56.348 --> 06:57.815
you're the man
who could make it happen.

06:57.883 --> 06:59.050
Oh, come on. No.
                           TONY:
                           Yeah!

06:59.117 --> 07:00.518
ELAINE:
                            Yes!

07:00.586 --> 07:03.187
I mean, even if I got a job,
  if I got that gofer's job--

07:03.254 --> 07:05.623
which is no small task--
      I mean, who's to say

07:05.691 --> 07:07.825
they'd let me do anything
       but go for coffee?

07:07.893 --> 07:10.028
Alex, you're forgetting the most
important thing about you.

07:10.095 --> 07:11.262
ALEX:
What?

07:11.330 --> 07:12.496
You're smart.
                      Yeah.

07:12.564 --> 07:14.398
You have ideas,
you have insight.

07:14.466 --> 07:17.068
There's no way those people
aren't gonna notice that.

07:17.135 --> 07:19.604
Alex, you try
for that job.

07:19.672 --> 07:21.705
Alex... go for it!

07:21.773 --> 07:24.475
Eye of the tiger.

07:24.543 --> 07:27.645
Alex, do it!

07:27.713 --> 07:29.613
All right,
I'm gonna go for it.

07:29.681 --> 07:31.182
Yeah.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.619
But I don't want anybody
          to find out.

07:34.686 --> 07:37.255
Oh, come on! Since when are you
worried about things like that?

07:37.322 --> 07:38.889
I don't want
              Louie to find out.
        Oh.

07:38.957 --> 07:40.557
Ah, so what?
      So you say to Louie,

07:40.625 --> 07:41.826
"Hey, Louie, I'm a gofer."

07:41.894 --> 07:43.728
No, no, no, no, you
         don't understand, Tony.

07:43.795 --> 07:47.298
I mean, the truth is, I would
       feel foolish saying that.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.367
You know what I mean?

07:49.434 --> 07:51.669
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I know what you mean.
                         Yeah.

07:51.736 --> 07:52.971
I mean, for some reason,

07:53.038 --> 07:56.040
something like this
makes you feel, uh, fragile.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.208
Yeah, yeah, so that's why

07:57.275 --> 07:58.476
Louie's never to
           find out, understand?

07:58.544 --> 08:00.245
Yeah.
             Now, I have to have
              your word on this.

08:00.312 --> 08:01.812
Hey, you have my word.
ELAINE:
You got it.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.080
Louie must
                 never find out.
          (door opens)

08:10.121 --> 08:13.658
Don't say another word.

08:13.725 --> 08:16.294
Please, don't take the fun
      out of this for me.

08:16.361 --> 08:17.494
ALEX:
            Louie...

08:17.562 --> 08:19.897
Basically, I'm a sportsman.

08:19.965 --> 08:23.000
Louie must never
                   find out, eh?

08:23.067 --> 08:25.569
(cackling)

08:25.637 --> 08:29.741
I give myself five minutes.

08:29.808 --> 08:33.910
I can't wait
 to see which one cracks first.

08:33.979 --> 08:35.846
I'll drive
                      you, Alex.
All right.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.649
Uh, good luck,
       Alex.

08:37.716 --> 08:40.284
Thank you.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.921
Iggy!

08:43.989 --> 08:45.256
(laughs)
           Hey, boss!

08:45.324 --> 08:47.257
(both laughing)

08:49.160 --> 08:50.428
Look, Iggy...
    Huh?

08:50.496 --> 08:54.298
How about if you and me,
     we play a little game, huh?

08:54.366 --> 08:56.266
All right,
                      all right.

08:56.334 --> 08:58.402
Now... Now, first,

08:58.470 --> 09:01.639
you ask me something
        that you want to know...

09:01.707 --> 09:02.807
Uh-huh.

09:02.874 --> 09:04.274
...and I'll
                   answer, okay?

09:04.342 --> 09:07.878
And then, I'll ask you
  something that I want to know,

09:07.946 --> 09:09.346
and you have to answer.

09:09.414 --> 09:10.748
Sounds like fun, boss.

09:10.816 --> 09:11.916
Yeah!

09:11.983 --> 09:13.084
(both laughing)

09:13.151 --> 09:14.285
Okay, all right.

09:14.353 --> 09:15.619
Now, you go first.

09:15.687 --> 09:17.321
Ask me anything.

09:17.389 --> 09:18.623
Okeydoke.

09:20.492 --> 09:23.761
Where is Tony taking Alex?

09:47.552 --> 09:49.620
I guess we should start
       those interviews.

09:49.688 --> 09:51.622
Put all calls through.

09:51.690 --> 09:53.524
Hey.

09:53.592 --> 09:55.126
Hey, the cabbie
        from last night.

09:55.194 --> 09:56.326
Yeah, Alex Reiger.

09:56.394 --> 09:57.495
Yeah. Hi.

09:57.563 --> 09:58.663
So, what's up, Alex?

09:58.730 --> 10:00.398
Did we leave something
          in your cab,

10:00.465 --> 10:01.899
or didn't this bum tip you?

10:01.966 --> 10:04.669
Uh, no, I, uh, came
about the gofer's job.

10:04.737 --> 10:05.836
Listen, Alex, I told you...

10:05.904 --> 10:06.970
ALEX:
You know what's great?

10:07.038 --> 10:08.573
I'm not at all nervous.

10:08.641 --> 10:11.976
Because this really feels right,
   so, uh, I guess that means

10:12.044 --> 10:13.611
you're gonna give me the job,
             right?

10:13.678 --> 10:15.179
Because, otherwise,
      I'd be nervous, huh?

10:15.247 --> 10:16.347
Boy, great.

10:16.415 --> 10:17.982
Now, I know
     what you're gonna say.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.017
Uh, you don't want to give me
 the job because you're afraid

10:20.084 --> 10:21.686
you'll feel kind of awkward
      bossing around a guy

10:21.754 --> 10:22.853
who's older than you, right?

10:22.921 --> 10:24.054
No.

10:24.122 --> 10:26.223
No, we like that.

10:26.291 --> 10:27.725
Oh, I get it.

10:27.792 --> 10:28.893
You're kidding.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.060
(laughs)

10:30.128 --> 10:32.029
Yeah, sort of wry?

10:32.097 --> 10:33.731
Huh? A little playful?

10:33.799 --> 10:35.967
Broadway hip, huh?

10:36.034 --> 10:37.768
Tender, but tough?

10:37.836 --> 10:39.103
(laughs)
I like him.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.404
Let's hire
the old coot.

10:40.471 --> 10:42.006
Hey!

10:42.074 --> 10:43.274
Congratulations,
                           Alex.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.441
Hey, thanks.

10:44.509 --> 10:45.743
Welcome
aboard.
           Thank you.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.545
Mm-hmm. How about
some lunch?

10:47.613 --> 10:49.614
Uh, no, thanks.
   I ate before I came over.

10:49.681 --> 10:52.483
Oh, right... yes...
             lunch.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.028
Hey, Alex.

11:04.096 --> 11:07.131
Wow!
A polite greeting!

11:07.198 --> 11:09.066
Never thought I'd hear
one of those again.

11:09.134 --> 11:11.068
Oh, no, no.

11:11.136 --> 11:12.703
You mean
                  it's that bad?

11:12.771 --> 11:14.538
It's terrible.
It's terrible.

11:14.606 --> 11:16.373
I don't think
       I can take much...

11:21.412 --> 11:23.347
I don't think
I can take much more of it.

11:23.415 --> 11:24.548
I'm telling you
right now.

11:24.616 --> 11:26.384
I mean, I didn't mind
       getting yelled at

11:26.452 --> 11:29.219
because the pastrami
      wasn't lean enough.

11:29.287 --> 11:30.420
I didn't mind, uh,

11:30.488 --> 11:32.123
having to blow up
    this inflatable cushion

11:32.191 --> 11:33.825
because the producer
        has a bad back.

11:33.892 --> 11:35.793
I...
(Tony grunts)

11:40.432 --> 11:42.399
But what really rankles me is
       having great ideas

11:42.467 --> 11:44.702
and not even be able
      to say 'em out loud.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.203
So, why haven't you?

11:46.271 --> 11:47.571
Because it's not my place.

11:47.639 --> 11:48.906
TONY:
Oh, man!

11:48.974 --> 11:50.207
(Elaine clears
                     her throat)

11:53.845 --> 11:57.581
Alex, nobody cares where
a really great idea comes from.

11:57.649 --> 12:00.017
Well, the other reason
        I kept quiet was

12:00.085 --> 12:02.853
because I-I didn't have
      a really great idea.

12:02.921 --> 12:04.588
Okay, Reiger.

12:04.656 --> 12:06.156
What?!

12:06.224 --> 12:07.658
Come on.
         What?!

12:07.725 --> 12:08.859
Come on, what is it?

12:08.927 --> 12:11.395
You're being so secretive,

12:11.463 --> 12:14.732
it must be something
            really embarrassing.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.200
Now what are
           you ashamed of?

12:16.268 --> 12:18.202
I'm not ashamed.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.472
I got a job in the theater.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.142
Let's just leave it
at that, all right?

12:24.209 --> 12:26.277
Wow.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.812
I'm impressed.

12:28.880 --> 12:34.017
I guess you'll be, uh, kissing
   the old cab job goodbye, huh?

12:34.085 --> 12:36.053
Well, no, not,
not right away, no.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.388
Why not?

12:37.456 --> 12:42.426
Because I, uh,
I've formed certain

12:42.494 --> 12:44.762
attachments that are
very real to me here.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.397
Well, good luck.

12:46.465 --> 12:47.898
Oh, thanks.

12:47.966 --> 12:50.601
Maybe I can come down
     and visit sometime, Reiger.

12:50.668 --> 12:52.703
Uh, no, you see, what
we're having now is,

12:52.771 --> 12:55.072
uh, it's something
called closed rehearsals.

12:55.140 --> 12:57.208
Maybe in the
not-too-distant future.

12:57.275 --> 12:59.477
But right now, I gotta go,
because I'm really very late.

12:59.544 --> 13:01.412
No, no, one more,
                 one more thing.

13:01.479 --> 13:06.617
Reiger, I always knew that
      you would be the first guy

13:06.685 --> 13:10.521
to dig himself
              out of this slime.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.490
Congratulations.
Thanks, Lou.

13:16.694 --> 13:22.200
He must have the cruddiest
       job in the world!

13:22.267 --> 13:24.735
I gotta go down
       and see him do it.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.470
Come on, Banta,
          where is it?
                             No.

13:26.538 --> 13:27.737
Where's he work, Nardo?
                      Forget it.

13:27.805 --> 13:29.039
Nardo, where does he...

13:29.107 --> 13:30.174
(growls)

13:34.413 --> 13:36.948
Why are you tormenting
                 yourself, boss?

13:37.015 --> 13:41.118
Because, Iggy,
      I got an opportunity

13:41.185 --> 13:46.389
to go down to some theater
 and really let Reiger have it.

13:46.457 --> 13:47.925
(growling)

13:47.993 --> 13:50.461
But I can't find out
          where it is.

13:50.528 --> 13:51.729
You don't know, do you?

13:51.796 --> 13:52.997
Yeah, I know.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.234
Well, tell me, Iggy, come on!

13:57.302 --> 13:58.435
Tell me.

13:58.503 --> 13:59.670
Iggy, Iggy,
you gotta tell me.

13:59.737 --> 14:01.839
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

14:01.906 --> 14:04.542
I can really go down there
and let him have it.

14:04.609 --> 14:06.043
Okay.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.312
Great, Iggy!

14:08.380 --> 14:14.451
I'll tell ya because...
              by my telling you,

14:14.519 --> 14:17.988
I'm giving you the chance
        to turn your life around

14:18.055 --> 14:20.991
and become a decent man.

14:23.828 --> 14:27.397
I used to be
            a reverend, boss,

14:27.465 --> 14:33.337
and I'm betting that when
      I tell you, you won't go.

14:33.405 --> 14:39.343
I'm betting you're
              about to be saved.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.414
Alex is working at the
             Ambassador Theater.

14:44.482 --> 14:47.751
That's it!

14:47.819 --> 14:50.955
Go celebrate
     your newfound virtue!

14:51.022 --> 14:53.757
Another sinner saved!

14:53.825 --> 14:55.960
Hallelujah!

15:01.900 --> 15:03.734
I don't know why this
        last scene doesn't work.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.102
I think it's the dialogue.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.636
Didn't he say the
same thing before?

15:06.704 --> 15:08.739
Alex, you want to do something
    about that trash basket?

15:08.806 --> 15:10.407
Can't; my hands are
   busy right now.

15:10.475 --> 15:11.942
Alex, just step in it.

15:12.010 --> 15:15.312
Right.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.748
ALLEN: Now, look,
            if it's the writing,

15:17.815 --> 15:19.083
we'll have Dave fix it.

15:19.151 --> 15:20.317
Let's not bother him today.

15:20.385 --> 15:21.752
He's got so many
                 rewrites to do.

15:21.819 --> 15:23.420
Hey, can I make a suggestion?

15:23.488 --> 15:25.890
No.
          Okay.

15:25.957 --> 15:28.625
Um, you know,
     you know what I think?

15:28.693 --> 15:30.594
I think, I think
     we need another scene.

15:30.662 --> 15:33.230
Yes, that's, yeah,
          we need another scene.

15:33.298 --> 15:34.631
We need a scene in which,

15:34.699 --> 15:37.234
uh, Carl would, uh, come
          to Michelle and say...

15:37.302 --> 15:38.669
I don't think you
need another scene.

15:38.736 --> 15:42.272
I think your problem
is staging here.

15:42.340 --> 15:45.076
I mean, all those entrances
and exits, they're killing you.

15:45.143 --> 15:46.377
Right?

15:46.444 --> 15:49.613
Look, all they have to do
      is go to a side set

15:49.681 --> 15:52.082
where nobody can hear them
     but they can be seen.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.784
You know, like in
      <i>Death of a Salesman.</i>

15:53.852 --> 15:55.352
You remember
      <i>Death of a Salesman?</i>

15:55.420 --> 15:57.187
See, they don't have
to be heard there.

15:57.255 --> 15:59.122
All they have to do is,
      um, simple behavior.

15:59.190 --> 16:00.323
You know what I mean?

16:00.391 --> 16:02.526
Alex, I don't want
    to seem rude,

16:02.593 --> 16:04.394
but we'll save
   the living theater.

16:04.462 --> 16:05.829
You take care
   of the patty melts.

16:06.898 --> 16:07.864
Right.

16:08.934 --> 16:11.202
Oh...

16:11.269 --> 16:12.436
This is yours.

16:12.504 --> 16:13.971
Oh, hey, are you busy?

16:14.039 --> 16:15.405
What can I do for you?

16:15.473 --> 16:17.774
Well, I need somebody to run
lines with me in this new scene.

16:17.842 --> 16:19.376
Uh, no, no, I'm not
           an actor really, I...

16:19.444 --> 16:21.311
You don't have to act, you
just have to give me cues.

16:21.379 --> 16:23.013
No, no, I, I, I...
You know, it starts
right over here.

16:23.081 --> 16:24.681
I'd really, I'd really feel
     kind of awkward doing this.

16:24.749 --> 16:26.216
I just want to get
the feel of it.

16:26.284 --> 16:27.651
Okay, all you gotta do
              is read the words.

16:27.719 --> 16:30.387
I know, but I really
can't do this.
                   Oh, please.

16:30.455 --> 16:32.155
Please.

16:41.632 --> 16:42.899
Here?

16:42.967 --> 16:44.935
Right there.

16:45.002 --> 16:48.038
Why are you acting
            like this, Michelle?

16:52.744 --> 16:56.012
Because... I want you.

17:00.251 --> 17:02.620
I want you desperately.

17:02.687 --> 17:04.555
I want you here.

17:04.622 --> 17:07.491
I want you here;
I want you now.

17:07.558 --> 17:09.226
And you don't think
             I want you?

17:13.765 --> 17:16.166
Not like I want you.

17:16.233 --> 17:18.401
I dream of you.

17:18.469 --> 17:19.936
I'm obsessed with you.

17:20.003 --> 17:21.271
You say that now,

17:21.339 --> 17:24.273
but why would this time
               be any different?

17:24.342 --> 17:30.781
Because, this time, my skin
cries out for your touch.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.417
Your mouth.

17:33.484 --> 17:34.851
Your lips.

17:34.919 --> 17:36.854
Your chest.

17:38.856 --> 17:42.059
(shrieks)

17:42.127 --> 17:44.427
What are you doing?!
                          I...

17:44.495 --> 17:45.930
What is with this guy?

17:45.997 --> 17:47.931
Jeff!

17:53.704 --> 17:56.640
Allen, we better get
       over to the stage.

17:56.708 --> 18:00.744
Yeah, Alex, Alex, I hate
         to bring this up again,

18:00.811 --> 18:02.780
but my cushion's
           getting a little low.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.381
You know, I got an idea.

18:04.449 --> 18:05.883
Why don't we get a
pump for this thing?

18:05.951 --> 18:07.117
Just fill it up.

18:07.185 --> 18:09.553
Have it in my car by, uh...

18:09.621 --> 18:12.222
Oh, boy, where's my watch?

18:12.289 --> 18:13.691
Huh?
                       You know,

18:13.758 --> 18:16.360
I bet I took my watch off
        and left it on the table

18:16.427 --> 18:19.763
and you put it in with
        the rest of the garbage.

18:19.831 --> 18:21.098
Oh...

18:21.166 --> 18:24.568
You know, I may not have
      even worn it today.

18:24.636 --> 18:29.105
I may have just
                   left it home.

18:29.173 --> 18:31.441
Alex...

18:31.509 --> 18:32.475
you better check anyway.

18:32.543 --> 18:34.878
(sighs heavily)

18:34.946 --> 18:36.747
When you put the
             cushion in the car,

18:36.814 --> 18:38.348
could you get
     the gas tank filled up

18:38.416 --> 18:40.383
and have it washed, too?
Yeah, okay, right.

18:50.762 --> 18:52.195
(inhales deeply)

19:03.374 --> 19:04.541
(inhaling)

19:09.980 --> 19:11.081
(inhaling loudly)

19:14.118 --> 19:16.620
Louie!

19:19.957 --> 19:21.525
How long have you been here?

19:23.628 --> 19:26.663
Too long.

19:26.731 --> 19:28.865
What have you seen?

19:28.933 --> 19:33.036
Too much.

19:33.104 --> 19:35.872
Who let you in here?

19:35.940 --> 19:38.308
Two guys.

19:51.790 --> 19:54.825
Goodbye, Reiger.

19:54.892 --> 19:59.463
I will never tell anybody
       about what I saw.

20:12.611 --> 20:17.381
Tell me something, Reiger...

20:17.448 --> 20:20.351
how could you do this
          to yourself?

20:22.920 --> 20:26.056
Reiger, do you know...

20:26.123 --> 20:28.959
what was special about you?

20:29.027 --> 20:30.494
Please, will you?

20:30.561 --> 20:37.300
You knew you were nothing
and you were great at it.

20:37.368 --> 20:42.239
But taking this job, Reiger,
it's like, it's like tampering.

20:42.307 --> 20:45.776
The theater.

20:45.843 --> 20:48.578
It's like trying to be
     something you're not.

20:50.681 --> 20:55.252
Hey, hey, Reiger, it's like
if you got a nose job.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.987
I mean, you'd be
walking around

20:57.055 --> 20:59.956
with this little nose saying,
"Hi, I'm Alex Reiger."

21:00.024 --> 21:01.825
And everybody would say,

21:01.892 --> 21:05.629
"That's cute, but we
want the real Reiger,

21:05.696 --> 21:09.466
the one with the honker
down to here."

21:09.534 --> 21:10.967
You know something, Louie,

21:11.035 --> 21:14.270
there's something you will
  never understand about this.

21:14.338 --> 21:17.407
There is a certain
     glamour and excitement

21:17.475 --> 21:21.111
about being connected
      to a Broadway show.

21:21.179 --> 21:26.650
Alex, you're an errand boy.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.285
Yeah?

21:28.352 --> 21:29.986
Well, not all the time.

21:30.054 --> 21:31.421
That's true.

21:31.489 --> 21:34.424
Sometimes you're
a trash compactor!

21:41.533 --> 21:43.300
Don't do this to me,
                  Louie, please.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.304
I'm right on the edge
            right now and I, uh,

21:47.372 --> 21:49.072
I don't feel good
            about what I'm doing

21:49.140 --> 21:51.975
so, please, don't
                 ruin it for me.

21:52.043 --> 21:54.478
You want to feel good about it?

21:54.546 --> 22:00.284
Then leave here with the ounce
of self-respect you got left.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.190
Take one of those sandwiches

22:06.257 --> 22:09.526
and shove it in
that guy's face!

22:09.594 --> 22:11.829
I'll get you one.

22:14.665 --> 22:16.600
Ooh!

22:16.668 --> 22:18.001
Egg salad!

22:18.069 --> 22:21.170
Alex?

22:21.238 --> 22:22.906
Alex, you busy?

22:22.974 --> 22:25.408
Look who's here.

22:25.476 --> 22:27.077
Listen, I want to talk
    to you about something.

22:27.144 --> 22:28.845
Listen, listen,
                sometimes I know
       I can be very distracted.

22:28.913 --> 22:30.314
Yeah...
      I know I can be very rude.

22:30.381 --> 22:31.748
Here.
                 But I do listen
             to what people say.

22:31.816 --> 22:32.749
Look, I...

22:32.817 --> 22:34.050
I think your idea's gonna work.

22:34.118 --> 22:35.218
We're gonna try it right now.

22:35.286 --> 22:36.620
Huh?

22:36.687 --> 22:38.521
Why don't you come watch
           it with us out front?

22:38.589 --> 22:39.856
Yeah, okay.

22:39.923 --> 22:42.025
Okay, and bring some coffee.

22:51.836 --> 22:54.071
Now, if you'll
               excuse me, Louie,

22:54.138 --> 22:56.639
I'm wanted out front.

23:09.820 --> 23:12.556
Oh, excuse me,

23:12.624 --> 23:15.659
would you run lines
with me, please?

23:34.278 --> 23:37.680
(theme song playing)

23:58.970 --> 24:00.437
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:00.504 --> 24:01.505
(man grumbling)

24:02.305 --> 24:08.682
