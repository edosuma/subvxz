00:08.400 --> 00:10.654
- I deserve more.
- He discharged himself.

00:10.658 --> 00:13.213
- What?!
- He did say something about Poland.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.617
What's in it for you?

00:14.618 --> 00:16.780
They will send me home, to Russia.

00:16.790 --> 00:20.119
Somebody's been siphoning money
from the Geneva account.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.437
Do you know who?

00:21.438 --> 00:23.597
Charles Kruger, born Sergei Korchmarev.

00:23.598 --> 00:26.318
Do you think he could actually be
the accountant for The Twelve?

00:27.960 --> 00:29.997
I want to find my family.
You'll find them.

00:29.998 --> 00:32.100
I can't stop thinking about you.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.109
Ugh!

00:35.110 --> 00:38.390
I don't want to talk about it.

01:01.460 --> 01:02.626
- Czesc.
- Czesc.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.180
Czesc.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.969
Uh...

04:03.970 --> 04:06.880
... I could, um... I could
pop out during my lunch.

04:08.380 --> 04:10.760
Okay. I'll see you then.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.661
No! It's not good enough!

04:19.640 --> 04:22.139
Yeah, I've been on the
phone for three weeks.

04:22.140 --> 04:25.188
Trying to get through to you.

04:40.730 --> 04:43.160
You do realise that's my desk?

04:45.340 --> 04:47.959
- Don't you guys hot-desk?
- Yeah.

04:47.960 --> 04:52.659
And that's the hot desk I
choose every single day.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.840
Fine.

05:08.860 --> 05:12.640
Would you like some of my Coco Pops?

05:14.750 --> 05:17.020
Yes, please.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.200
There you go.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.549
Okay, where did we get
to with the money trail?

05:24.550 --> 05:26.119
Uh, with Kruger dead,

05:26.120 --> 05:27.931
we're kind of back to square one.

05:27.932 --> 05:29.519
Let's take a look at the other kills.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.333
There's got to be a connection.

05:31.334 --> 05:34.119
There is a political
agitator in Catalonia

05:34.120 --> 05:36.699
responsible for organizing
violent protests,

05:36.700 --> 05:40.639
then a CEO of a French
semiconductor company

05:40.640 --> 05:42.860
with no links to Spain at all.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.429
What is that smell?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.632
I can't smell anything.

05:51.550 --> 05:54.100
There's something about
this I've seen before.

05:55.670 --> 05:56.919
- What's that?
- Something about...

05:56.920 --> 05:58.319
something about the powder.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.640
No, no, no. What's that?

06:03.400 --> 06:05.480
Pants.

06:08.060 --> 06:09.559
Don't put them in my bin!

06:09.560 --> 06:13.309
Look up Soviet-era murders,
they're early '80s, I think.

06:13.310 --> 06:17.389
Something to do with, uh,
the Olympics or a sports team.

06:17.390 --> 06:21.119
Eve? You need to sign for this.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.160
Oh!

06:25.380 --> 06:26.560
Thanks.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.680
Is it your birthday?

06:47.200 --> 06:49.480
Hey, guys, it's Eve's birthday.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.335
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

06:53.336 --> 06:55.456
- Happy birthday!
- You're supposed to share the cake!

07:42.625 --> 07:44.466
Is it really your birthday?

07:44.467 --> 07:46.068
What?

07:46.069 --> 07:48.111
Today. Is it really your birthday?

07:49.600 --> 07:52.919
Actually, yes, it is.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.859
How did it feel?

07:54.860 --> 07:55.910
What?

07:55.918 --> 07:58.761
Waking up in the office on your big day.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.920
Uh, wh-what makes you say that?

08:05.120 --> 08:07.849
Look, I can't have you
camping out on the sofa.

08:07.850 --> 08:10.000
Where's Bear gonna take his power naps?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.349
I'll find somewhere else.

08:13.350 --> 08:14.880
Where?

08:26.360 --> 08:29.472
Oh, I didn't realise you had, um...

08:31.040 --> 08:33.179
... dependants.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.869
Bathroom's down the hall.

08:34.870 --> 08:37.419
Cistern makes a...

08:37.419 --> 08:39.200
- weird noise.
- Okay.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.440
Oh! Shit!

09:07.990 --> 09:10.353
Oi.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.109
Oh, no, it's okay. You have it.

09:13.110 --> 09:16.959
Consider it a birthday gift.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.480
Thanks.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.699
You're like a sad teenager,
waiting for a like on Instagram.

09:34.690 --> 09:37.519
Don't you like having fun?

09:37.520 --> 09:40.479
Honestly, I don't know if I can anymore.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.579
That's bollocks.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.379
Oh, well, you don't...

09:44.380 --> 09:45.568
... you don't know what it's like

09:45.570 --> 09:47.499
when you've chosen to
destroy your own life.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.079
I promise you, whatever you've done

09:50.080 --> 09:53.439
is not half as bad as the
stuff in my chequered past.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.919
I know that's not true.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.069
Uh-uh.

09:57.070 --> 09:59.960
This morning, I took
a piss in the shower.

10:01.420 --> 10:02.839
You did not!

10:02.840 --> 10:04.519
Yep.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.639
Just let it go.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.520
Your turn.

10:09.690 --> 10:13.149
I... have...

10:13.150 --> 10:15.540
never bought The Big Issue.

10:18.340 --> 10:21.584
You can do better than that.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.960
Uh...

10:35.760 --> 10:38.159
I was unfaithful to my husband.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.859
I put him in so much danger,

10:39.860 --> 10:42.399
he ended up in hospital with PTSD.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.648
I took my kid to the zoo
when I was high on ketamine.

10:45.649 --> 10:47.599
I stabbed someone.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.240
GBH charge when I was 18.

10:51.840 --> 10:56.240
I left a man to die so I
could save a psychopath.

10:58.780 --> 11:01.980
My best friend died on
the drugs that I gave him.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.680
I...

11:08.200 --> 11:09.712
Jesus, really?

11:10.700 --> 11:12.799
Do not think that you are

11:12.800 --> 11:16.429
the only self-loathing
arsehole in the room, ever.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.160
Choices, Eve.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.200
It's all about choices.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.759
What do you want from me?

12:08.360 --> 12:09.920
Oh!

12:34.740 --> 12:36.070
Eve!

12:40.120 --> 12:42.400
Does this look familiar?

12:44.320 --> 12:47.949
- Chalk!
- This was in 1974.

12:47.950 --> 12:50.099
It was a suspected sporting rivalry,

12:50.100 --> 12:52.053
like a Russian Lee Bowyer

12:52.054 --> 12:53.929
and a Kieron Dyer,

12:53.930 --> 12:56.159
uh, except no-one died.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.059
- Uh, no-one was convicted?
- Nope.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.541
Not even a suspect.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.302
So, what's all this got
to do with Kenny?

13:01.303 --> 13:03.059
It doesn't on the surface, but if you...

13:03.060 --> 13:04.740
if you take a look at
the Catalan murder...

13:09.320 --> 13:12.179
- Okay, they're similar.
- No, they're not similar.

13:12.180 --> 13:13.419
They're the same.

13:13.420 --> 13:14.557
Our current assassin

13:14.558 --> 13:17.829
clearly copied this killer,
which means... uh...

13:17.830 --> 13:18.879
What?

13:18.880 --> 13:23.140
... uh, who... whoever this killer
was might lead us to The Twelve.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.999
This was over 40 years ago.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.040
I mean, how are we supposed
to find this person now?

13:30.700 --> 13:31.800
Eve?

13:33.720 --> 13:35.360
- I have to go.
- What?!

13:37.540 --> 13:38.581
Eve!

13:39.740 --> 13:41.429
Choices.

13:41.430 --> 13:43.224
It's all about choices.

13:43.225 --> 13:45.027
What the bloody hell
are you talking about?

14:00.230 --> 14:02.040
Niko?

14:14.960 --> 14:17.880
Niko!

15:12.540 --> 15:15.798
Irina. Want to skive off?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.640
Ask me in Sanskrit.

15:18.641 --> 15:19.919
No.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.199
You are going to sneak
out of school with me

15:22.200 --> 15:23.479
because I'm your father,

15:23.480 --> 15:25.888
because I'm telling you to do it.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.060
How does your mother's new boyfriend

15:36.070 --> 15:37.609
afford a German car?

15:37.610 --> 15:39.729
He's an oil company exec.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.539
- He's a crook.
- Like you.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.800
He doesn't buy you ice-cream, huh?

15:47.820 --> 15:50.231
Can I stay with you tonight?

15:50.232 --> 15:52.689
Tonight?

15:52.690 --> 15:54.129
Oh.

15:54.130 --> 15:56.718
I have to be back in England tonight.

15:56.719 --> 15:58.509
Is England better than your daughter?

15:58.510 --> 15:59.521
Yes.

15:59.522 --> 16:01.379
No.

16:01.380 --> 16:04.739
England is terrible. Way worse than you.

16:04.740 --> 16:06.940
But it's my job to do terrible things.

16:06.950 --> 16:08.369
Your job?

16:08.370 --> 16:11.879
Working for the Russian state
security service, Irina,

16:11.880 --> 16:12.929
that's a big deal.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.789
Do you think I'm a moron?

16:14.790 --> 16:17.039
You might pretend to be
working for the FSB,

16:17.040 --> 16:19.079
might pretend to be helping MI6.

16:19.080 --> 16:22.499
We both know what you're
really working for: yourself.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.586
And it's only a matter of time
before they all catch up with you.

16:24.587 --> 16:27.188
And you'll be dead and
I'll be even more alone

16:27.189 --> 16:28.510
and miserable than I am now.

16:28.511 --> 16:31.512
I will try to patch things
up with your mother.

16:31.513 --> 16:32.555
That's not what I want.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.718
- What, then?
- I want you to have a plan.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.439
I have a plan!

16:38.440 --> 16:40.900
You're full of shit.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.979
The... the day it happened...

17:00.980 --> 17:03.866
Charles sent me such an odd email.

17:04.859 --> 17:06.138
Uh...

17:06.140 --> 17:09.180
I think he must have
written it in a hurry or...

17:13.660 --> 17:15.239
What did it say?

17:15.240 --> 17:16.510
Um...

17:16.518 --> 17:20.722
... something about a lot of
money that had gone missing.

17:20.723 --> 17:23.179
He'd worked out who'd taken it.

17:23.180 --> 17:24.809
And...

17:24.810 --> 17:27.049
if anything happened to him,

17:27.050 --> 17:29.731
I had to forward an email on to someone.

17:29.732 --> 17:31.609
Who?

17:31.610 --> 17:34.069
I didn't recognise the address.

17:34.070 --> 17:38.749
It... it had some... some
kind of file attached to it.

17:38.750 --> 17:42.179
I just have this...
feeling he was mixed up

17:42.180 --> 17:44.000
with something awful!

17:46.750 --> 17:49.271
Did you send the file?

17:50.320 --> 17:53.230
I'm in such a muddle,
I don't know what to do!

17:53.235 --> 17:54.689
I...

17:54.690 --> 17:56.277
This is what we do.

17:56.278 --> 17:58.359
You send this file to me.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.041
Okay?

18:00.042 --> 18:01.379
Yes.

18:01.380 --> 18:05.406
And we get you somewhere
safe as soon as possible.

18:05.407 --> 18:07.049
I could go to the holiday house.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.492
That's perfect.

18:49.980 --> 18:51.420
Boo!

19:20.680 --> 19:23.119
So not over me.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.300
So not over...

19:32.810 --> 19:34.175
Ah!

19:34.176 --> 19:35.737
You made me cake.

19:35.738 --> 19:36.859
It's not for you.

19:36.860 --> 19:37.910
Oh.

19:40.300 --> 19:41.622
It really doesn't look like the picture.

19:41.623 --> 19:44.266
I know that. Okay?

19:48.350 --> 19:49.939
No, wait, wait.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.434
Just because it looks bad,
doesn't mean it tastes bad.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.120
Mm. Throw it away.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.379
- Don't do that!
- You don't deserve nice things

20:04.380 --> 20:05.650
if you don't look after them.

20:10.840 --> 20:14.499
- So, London went well?
- Yeah, it was good.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.929
Did you do anything when you were there?

20:16.930 --> 20:19.099
Uh... Mmm!

20:19.100 --> 20:21.820
A Jack the Ripper walking tour.

20:25.707 --> 20:27.428
Why are you lying to me?

20:27.429 --> 20:29.149
I'm not.

20:29.150 --> 20:32.360
I gained valuable insight into
Victorian gender politics.

20:33.790 --> 20:37.380
Who did you see in London?

20:38.430 --> 20:40.309
Okay.

20:40.310 --> 20:42.659
Fine.

20:42.660 --> 20:47.359
Not that it's anything to do
with you. I saw Konstantin.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.620
You're close, Villanelle.

20:48.630 --> 20:51.469
You're so close to
getting what you want.

20:51.470 --> 20:53.889
But you have to play by the rules.

20:53.890 --> 20:55.017
Oh!

20:55.020 --> 20:57.498
You are so annoying today.

20:57.499 --> 21:00.301
- Oh, I'm annoying?
- Mm.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.304
She thinks I'm annoying.

21:03.460 --> 21:04.860
Who are you talking to?

21:04.867 --> 21:08.310
I am just trying to
save you from yourself!

21:09.420 --> 21:14.280
So, bear with me if I
get a little frustrated.

21:20.350 --> 21:22.519
They want to meet with you.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.320
Why?

21:24.326 --> 21:26.488
They need to discuss your new contract,

21:26.490 --> 21:29.651
holiday pay, benefits, et cetera.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.698
So, I'm getting promoted?

21:37.699 --> 21:40.949
You work well, you move up.

21:40.950 --> 21:43.599
In the meantime, they want you to rest,

21:43.600 --> 21:45.907
conserve your strength.

21:45.908 --> 21:47.829
So...

21:47.830 --> 21:49.760
spend your money.

21:49.770 --> 21:52.510
Get an ombre balayage. Enjoy yourself.

21:52.514 --> 21:55.838
But no travel, okay? You stay put.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.129
Yes!

22:38.950 --> 22:41.082
Boo!

22:42.524 --> 22:45.720
You know, you really don't
have to be so dramatic.

22:46.808 --> 22:49.091
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't make me go in there.

22:49.092 --> 22:52.419
Let's go somewhere we
can talk, somewhere...

22:52.420 --> 22:53.730
relaxing.

22:59.430 --> 23:00.859
This would be...

23:00.860 --> 23:04.505
- a really bad way to go.
- Stop it!

23:04.506 --> 23:05.827
Stop it!

23:11.860 --> 23:15.679
Are you upset because soon
I'm going to be your boss?

23:15.680 --> 23:17.479
- You won't be my boss.
- Don't worry.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.540
You'll be my favourite.

23:19.550 --> 23:22.110
All the other employees will hate you.

23:23.165 --> 23:25.887
What got you in such a good mood?

23:27.580 --> 23:29.599
- It's Eve's birthday today.
- Oh.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.493
But you shot her, and
ruined her marriage.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.416
- Isn't that enough?
- The moustache is gone?

23:36.590 --> 23:38.779
I hear he's in Poland.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.700
Oh...

23:44.100 --> 23:45.820
I got what you ask for.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.080
Your family.

23:57.879 --> 24:00.759
- You know where they are?
- Not yet.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.359
But I can find out.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.403
But I need you to...

24:04.404 --> 24:05.879
... do something for me.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.139
Something personal.

24:07.140 --> 24:08.209
Off the record.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.212
I really hate it when you do that.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.656
I'll do it.

24:16.178 --> 24:19.100
- Okay?
- But please do it nicely.

24:19.101 --> 24:21.279
Something efficient.

24:21.280 --> 24:24.300
You want it nice or
you want it efficient?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.920
Just make it done, okay?

24:50.840 --> 24:52.880
Oh.

24:55.930 --> 24:59.380
Um, it's... it's still very raw.

24:59.381 --> 25:01.599
- You know.
- Of course.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.600
We were together for nearly 30 years.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.699
We knew one another inside out.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.819
Now that he's gone, I...

25:10.820 --> 25:12.633
You're free now.

25:12.634 --> 25:15.629
You can be whoever you want.

25:15.630 --> 25:18.999
But I... I don't want to be free.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.179
I want to be a family!

25:33.280 --> 25:35.089
Oh!

25:35.090 --> 25:37.418
Uh, you have the hiccups?

25:39.380 --> 25:41.100
Can't get rid of them.

25:42.050 --> 25:43.905
Bah!

25:44.840 --> 25:46.948
I-I used to do that with my children,

25:46.950 --> 25:49.910
to scare the hiccups away.

25:49.911 --> 25:51.473
Did it work?

25:55.950 --> 25:57.918
Oh, dear.

25:57.919 --> 25:59.761
Try again.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.109
- Bah!
- Ah!

26:18.260 --> 26:20.219
Rrahh!

26:20.220 --> 26:24.225
Ah!

27:38.310 --> 27:39.919
Is it done?

28:28.200 --> 28:29.860
Morning, Mum.

28:40.530 --> 28:43.164
- I didn't order this.
- Um...

28:43.170 --> 28:46.408
consider it an olive branch.

28:51.100 --> 28:53.239
Look, I was tone-deaf,

28:53.240 --> 28:56.578
and in the light of everything
that's happened...

28:57.720 --> 29:00.500
I'm really rather embarrassed.

29:02.260 --> 29:04.689
Well, if I'd been given the
proper authority from the start,

29:04.690 --> 29:08.260
we might have avoided the needless
death of an innocent man.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.599
But Kruger wasn't innocent, was he?

29:11.600 --> 29:13.400
Thought he was embezzling money.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.030
Kruger was up to his eyebrows in debt.

29:18.039 --> 29:21.489
Foreclosures coming out of his bottom.

29:21.490 --> 29:24.079
His actions were not that of a man

29:24.080 --> 29:27.769
with a casual 6 million sloshing
around in his sock drawer.

29:27.770 --> 29:29.890
So, he was framed?

29:29.891 --> 29:32.349
How would I know?

29:32.350 --> 29:34.679
I've been ordered to stay
away from all of this.

29:37.980 --> 29:39.540
Tell me what you need.

29:39.541 --> 29:41.999
Well, you've changed your tune.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.899
You had a close call.

29:43.900 --> 29:45.439
Now, if anything had happened to you,

29:45.440 --> 29:48.019
I would have been partly responsible.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.752
That's something I take very seriously.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.848
Losing my husband in the divorce

29:54.849 --> 29:56.917
sent me into a grief of its own.

29:56.918 --> 30:00.049
I know it's not the same thing,

30:00.050 --> 30:02.060
but I just want to say...

30:03.480 --> 30:05.900
I do understand loss.

30:12.374 --> 30:14.089
My office.

30:14.090 --> 30:15.329
Sorry?

30:15.330 --> 30:17.898
Well, that's the first thing I need.

30:17.899 --> 30:21.142
But you don't even know
where your office is.

30:22.820 --> 30:25.260
That doesn't mean I don't need it back.

30:57.570 --> 30:58.940
Mum!

31:00.280 --> 31:02.940
What are you doing home
at this hour of the day?

31:04.220 --> 31:07.579
Why? Was I supposed to run it past you?

31:07.580 --> 31:11.029
No, of... of course not. I... just...

31:11.030 --> 31:15.419
It is a bit odd being here
in the daytime, isn't it?

31:15.420 --> 31:17.530
Whatever do you find
to do with yourself?

31:18.930 --> 31:21.109
Must be rather dull.

31:21.110 --> 31:22.969
Not really.

31:22.970 --> 31:25.180
I get up to all sorts of stuff.

31:27.020 --> 31:29.170
Have you had any visitors lately?

31:31.630 --> 31:33.414
Um...

31:33.415 --> 31:37.649
just my friend Lily, from university.

31:37.650 --> 31:40.100
You, um... you don't know her.

31:51.340 --> 31:53.440
Oh, Mum!

31:56.620 --> 31:59.160
Geraldine, I... I've had
a very long day, and...

31:59.170 --> 32:00.962
I feel so lost.

32:04.740 --> 32:06.679
You know?

32:06.680 --> 32:07.919
You know,

32:07.920 --> 32:11.399
you... you barely even
look at me, and...

32:11.400 --> 32:14.039
Nonsense. We've just had a perfectly
pleasant exchange in the hall.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.999
I'm trying to tell you that
I'm worried about you, Mum.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.899
You!

32:18.900 --> 32:20.219
What for?

32:20.220 --> 32:22.463
Because it's weird to
carry on like this,

32:22.464 --> 32:25.667
not even saying his
name, for God's sake!

32:29.440 --> 32:32.189
I'm doing more for your brother
than you could possibly imagine.

32:32.190 --> 32:35.809
Then talk to me about it.

32:35.810 --> 32:37.959
Let me in.

32:40.410 --> 32:45.609
If you and I are to inhabit this
space together, Geraldine,

32:45.610 --> 32:47.848
we have to respect each other.

32:47.849 --> 32:51.489
Our privacy and our grief.

32:51.490 --> 32:55.029
I dare say there are
things you don't tell me.

32:55.030 --> 32:57.969
Though perhaps for
quite different reasons.

32:57.970 --> 33:01.783
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
going upstairs for a lie-down.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.360
You have hat hair.

34:54.620 --> 34:57.209
You said you had
everything under control.

34:57.210 --> 34:58.919
I did. I do.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.959
Then why is she running around London,

35:00.960 --> 35:04.079
pursuing her agent friend?

35:04.080 --> 35:05.540
The one who wears the...

35:09.420 --> 35:10.671
Turtleneck.

35:10.672 --> 35:13.249
She's a little skittish right now.

35:13.250 --> 35:15.899
She has a lot of changes.
I have it in hand.

35:15.900 --> 35:18.070
- All we need to do is...
- That's not how it looks.

35:21.763 --> 35:24.285
You want to go back home, to Russia?

35:25.580 --> 35:27.439
Where the people will be
dancing in the streets

35:27.440 --> 35:29.339
and chanting your name.

35:29.340 --> 35:33.460
"Dasha! Dasha! Dasha!"

35:33.470 --> 35:34.776
Well, you can't.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.689
Until we say you can.

35:37.690 --> 35:41.783
Skittish is not acceptable.

35:49.911 --> 35:50.952
Get her working.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.670
Without this, um, extracurricular crap.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.280
I can kill Polastri.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.520
No. This would cause too
many other problems.

36:07.720 --> 36:10.160
Just drive a wedge between them.

36:10.170 --> 36:12.173
We don't care how.

36:13.220 --> 36:15.977
Use your, uh, imagination.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.140
Milena.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.351
Czesc.

36:51.090 --> 36:52.359
Tak. Tak.

37:09.991 --> 37:11.620
- Huh?
- Oh...

37:13.900 --> 37:15.190
Ba.

37:15.196 --> 37:16.957
Dziekuje.

37:18.570 --> 37:19.880
Dobre.

37:40.990 --> 37:43.479
Ah, khorosho!

37:43.480 --> 37:46.386
No more food for you, little piggies.

37:46.387 --> 37:47.889
Good piggies.

38:49.330 --> 38:51.930
Not getting any, huh?

39:37.578 --> 39:39.490
Niko?

39:48.560 --> 39:49.969
Niko!

39:57.558 --> 39:59.520
Eve.
