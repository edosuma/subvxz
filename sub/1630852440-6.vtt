10:19.994 --> 10:22.455
<i>-[audience exclaims]</i>
<i>-Which is like… [laughs]</i>

10:22.538 --> 10:26.083
<i>I guess she thinks that 'cause every year</i>
<i>on his birthday in September,</i>

10:26.167 --> 10:29.337
<i>he'll put on </i>Singing in the Rain.
<i>That's his favorite movie. Okay?</i>

10:29.420 --> 10:31.130
<i>He'll put it on and dance like…</i>

10:31.213 --> 10:33.424
<i>♪ I'm singing in the rain ♪</i>

10:33.507 --> 10:36.594
<i>And she probably looks over</i>

10:39.096 --> 10:39.930
<i>Poor Dad.</i>

10:41.349 --> 10:44.977
<i>Their dynamic</i>

<i>in </i>Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles.
<i>Remember that?</i>

10:48.147 --> 10:50.149
<i>They argue like in that movie.</i>

10:50.232 --> 10:52.818
<i>I hear my parents in the room.</i>
<i>I hear my mom go,</i>

10:52.902 --> 10:54.403
<i>"Hey, Mike. Mike."</i>

10:54.487 --> 10:57.239
<i>"Not everyone needs to like you. Okay?"</i>

10:57.323 --> 11:00.951
<i>"You don't need everybody to like you.</i>
<i>People don't like me. I'm okay."</i>

11:01.035 --> 11:03.913
<i>"You don't see me crying. I don't care."</i>

11:03.996 --> 11:05.581
<i>My dad's like, "Stop it, Lupe."</i>

11:05.665 --> 11:08.751

<i>"Hey, </i>Abuelita<i>. How's it going?"</i>

12:33.961 --> 12:37.673

14:29.034 --> 14:31.120
<i>Go everywhere. It's an honor.</i>

14:31.203 --> 14:34.373
<i>But I remember that Christmas Eve.</i>
<i>Everyone left. It was midnight.</i>

14:34.456 --> 14:36.750
<i>We saw a little puddle</i>
<i>on the cushion, the couch.</i>

14:36.834 --> 14:38.961
<i>We didn't know if it was wine or piss.</i>

14:39.044 --> 14:40.754
<i>And we're being silly at that hour.</i>

14:40.838 --> 14:43.340
<i>My mom grabbed the cushion, she was like,</i>

14:43.966 --> 14:44.842
<i>"Smell it."</i>

14:46.385 --> 14:49.346
<i>And I love sniffing things.</i>
<i>So I went in there. [sniffs]</i>

14:49.430 --> 14:51.140
<i>And now I speak Spanish.</i>

14:51.849 --> 14:54.268

14:57.354 --> 14:58.981
<i>[laughs]</i>

15:01.358 --> 15:05.446
<i>I love my culture, but as a kid,</i>
<i>I was a brat. I didn't appreciate it.</i>

15:05.529 --> 15:06.780
<i>I was a little brat.</i>

15:06.864 --> 15:10.826
<i>We would have Mexican food all the time.</i>
<i>A lot of beans in our house. Okay?</i>

15:10.910 --> 15:14.163
<i>And I'd complain to my mom. I'd be like,</i>
<i>"I don't want any more beans."</i>

15:14.246 --> 15:15.873
<i>"No more beans!"</i>

15:15.956 --> 15:17.958

<i>Unless you like nasty stuff. Go for it.</i>

20:51.667 --> 20:54.920
<i>Look, I love learning fun facts. Okay?</i>

20:55.003 --> 20:57.381
<i>'Cause I like sharing</i>
<i>fun facts with my friends,</i>

20:57.464 --> 20:59.466
<i>'cause I just want them to think,</i>

20:59.549 --> 21:02.135
<i>"Man, Melissa has</i>
<i>some smart things up her sleeve."</i>

21:03.553 --> 21:06.765
<i>But you know what bugs me?</i>
<i>The minute someone questions my fun fact,</i>

21:06.848 --> 21:08.850
<i>that's when I lose all confidence.</i>

21:09.351 --> 21:11.645
<i>I was hiking with my boyfriend</i>
<i>and I was like,</i>

21:11.728 --> 21:14.940
<i>"Hey. That's poison ivy over there.</i>
<i>And you know how you know?"</i>

21:15.023 --> 21:17.150
<i>"Leaves of three, let them be."</i>

21:17.985 --> 21:19.611
<i>And he goes, "Oh, really?"</i>

21:20.737 --> 21:21.655
<i>"I don't know."</i>

21:22.447 --> 21:24.574
<i>"I don't know.</i>
<i>I think I read it somewhere."</i>

21:24.658 --> 21:27.536
<i>"I don't know. Don't quote me!</i>
<i>Don't go tell all your friends."</i>

21:27.619 --> 21:28.954
<i>"God! Now I'm pissed."</i>

21:29.037 --> 21:31.581
<i>"How about</i>
<i>you roll around in there and find out."</i>

21:37.462 --> 21:38.422
<i>[laughs]</i>

21:39.214 --> 21:41.967
<i>He's got a good sense of humor.</i>
<i>I'm really grateful for that.</i>

21:42.050 --> 21:45.470
<i>'Cause I've gone out with guys</i>
<i>that don't laugh at the same things as me,</i>

21:45.554 --> 21:47.764
<i>and it's like, that's the worst.</i>

21:47.848 --> 21:49.516
<i>You're just alone. You know?</i>

21:50.017 --> 21:52.269
<i>I was seeing a guy a few years ago.</i>

21:52.352 --> 21:53.520
<i>We went to Mexico,</i>

21:53.603 --> 21:56.023
<i>and something happened</i>
<i>in Mexico where I was like,</i>

21:56.106 --> 21:58.317
<i>"It's not gonna work.</i>
<i>He didn't laugh at me."</i>

21:58.817 --> 22:01.486
<i>We were on a little boat.</i>
<i>Okay? </i>Pobrecito.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.488
<i>He set it up at sunset.</i>

22:03.572 --> 22:05.782
<i>One of those</i>
<i>little colorful boats in Mexico.</i>

22:05.866 --> 22:07.784
<i>It's just me and him on the boat. Just…</i>

22:10.412 --> 22:14.041
<i>And I look at his ass.</i>
<i>I'm allowed to. I was dating him. Okay?</i>

22:14.541 --> 22:17.627
<i>I see his pants are a little low.</i>
<i>Top of the crack is showing.</i>

22:18.128 --> 22:20.881
<i>Now what do you do</i>
<i>if you see a little bit of the crack?</i>

22:20.964 --> 22:22.507
<i>You give it a little boop.</i>

22:23.925 --> 22:27.429
<i>That's… My brain immediately was,</i>
<i>"Yeah. You boop it of course."</i>

22:28.096 --> 22:30.891
<i>Don't keep your finger in there long.</i>
<i>Just a quick…</i>

22:31.600 --> 22:34.936
<i>So I saw the crack and I was like…</i>
<i>[chuckles] "Cool. I'm going in."</i>

22:36.271 --> 22:38.899
<i>Boop. [laughs]</i>

22:38.982 --> 22:41.401
<i>He goes, "Don't do that.</i>
<i>I don't like that."</i>

22:43.820 --> 22:46.156
<i>"Really?" He's like, "I don't like it."</i>

22:47.449 --> 22:48.992
<i>So we get to the land.</i>

22:49.826 --> 22:51.953
<i>And I'm just like, "Oh, my gosh."</i>

22:52.704 --> 22:54.456
<i>You know when something's funny to you</i>

22:54.539 --> 22:57.667
<i>but the other person's not having it,</i>
<i>it just makes you laugh harder?</i>

22:57.751 --> 22:59.419
<i>That's what was happening to me.</i>

22:59.503 --> 23:02.130
<i>I was like, "Don't think about it anymore.</i>
<i>Let it go."</i>

23:02.214 --> 23:04.341
<i>But no. I kept hearing it</i>
<i>in my mind on a loop.</i>

23:04.424 --> 23:08.428
<i>I kept hearing, "Boop, 'Don't do that.'</i>
<i>Boop, 'Don't do that.'"</i>

23:08.512 --> 23:11.139
<i>And I never felt more alone,</i>
<i>just laughing.</i>

23:12.849 --> 23:15.060
<i>The trip ended</i>
<i>and I was like, "I gotta end it."</i>

23:15.143 --> 23:15.977
<i>I called him.</i>

23:16.061 --> 23:20.148
<i>"It's not gonna work out. We don't laugh</i>
<i>at the same things, and that's okay."</i>

23:20.232 --> 23:23.568
<i>He goes, "Give me an example of when</i>
<i>we didn't laugh at the same thing."</i>

23:24.069 --> 23:25.529
<i>Ay-ay-ay.</i>

23:27.114 --> 23:30.450
<i>"Well, that time</i>
<i>on the boat when I booped you."</i>

23:31.034 --> 23:32.869
<i>"Booped you on the boat."</i>

23:32.953 --> 23:36.123
<i>He goes, "Well, I don't like that.</i>
<i>Growing up, my dad did that."</i>

23:36.206 --> 23:38.250
<i>-[audience members] Aw!</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

<i>[seductively] "Your dad sounds great."</i>

23:45.924 --> 23:49.636
<i>"Is he still with your mom?</i>
<i>'Cause I wanna boop all night long."</i>

23:50.512 --> 23:51.430
<i>Pobrecito.</i>

23:53.181 --> 23:55.600
<i>On that trip in Mexico</i>
<i>he wanted to go to church,</i>

23:55.684 --> 23:58.437
<i>and I'm kind of a little brat</i>
<i>on vacations,</i>

23:58.520 --> 24:01.189
<i>and I was on a break from </i>SNL,
<i>and I was like,</i>

24:01.273 --> 24:03.108
<i>"I don't wanna go to church."</i>

24:03.191 --> 24:05.193
<i>"I don't wanna go. No!"</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:10.323
<i>He takes me to a church, and he was like,</i>
<i>"It's closed 'cause of earthquake damage."</i>

24:10.407 --> 24:12.325
<i>And I just thought, "Oh, thank God."</i>

24:13.160 --> 24:14.870
<i>I'd have to find a baby.</i>

24:15.954 --> 24:16.997
