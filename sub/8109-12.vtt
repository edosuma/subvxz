he went to a double A school,

No concussion, no stroke,

you think he's above
injecting steroids?

04:00.699 --> 04:03.065
Repeated head trauma
could damage
the base of the brain,

04:03.160 --> 04:06.197
leading to
a pituitary adenoma,
which leaks GnRH.

Pituitary damage
wouldn't be visible
on a CT scan.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.198

the excess hormones
that could cause the rage

there is no

We're going to
test for damage
to your pituitary.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.478
If there is, it could
create excess hormones,

05:22.572 --> 05:23.687
which could be
causing your pain.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.522
It would also explain
your rage attack.

is damaged,

05:27.035 --> 05:28.275

nothing too invasive.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.928

of days of recovery,

05:49.057 --> 05:51.969

was coach,

rethink your promise.

been there.

to go again.

It was fun.
Put lunch in the books,
just you and me.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.991
Our patient
could have a PFO.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.320
Well, naturally you jump
right to a urinary issue.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.201
PFO's not urinary,
it's a heart issue.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.248
It is? Oh.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.327
Well, naturally you think
it's not a urinary issue

11:12.422 --> 11:13.377
because you're
so embarrassed

11:13.464 --> 11:15.045
about your own
past urinary issues,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.006
you don't dare
broach the subject.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.130
Oh, come on.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.678
You spending the night
over at Bobby Samson's?

11:26.269 --> 11:27.850
(SIGHS)

11:28.188 --> 11:31.430
I did not wet the bed,
I spilled a drink.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.065
We're not buying it, Eric.
We never bought it.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.437
Why are you telling him
these things?

11:35.528 --> 11:39.112
What's the big deal?
It was 25 years ago.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.617
Oxygenated and
de-oxygenated blood mix,

11:41.743 --> 11:44.029
the rough flow causes a clot,
explains the heart and head.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.829
Like that power forward
from Loyola Marymount
when he...

11:47.957 --> 11:49.948
Hank Gathers?
That's not what
happened to him.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.917
Whoa,
let your brother speak.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.335
What happened
to Hank Gathers?

11:55.089 --> 11:56.545
conference tournament.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.169
Alley-oop dunk,
jams it home,

11:58.259 --> 12:00.090
then he runs up
the court and splat.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.294
He dropped dead
of a heart thing
right there on the court.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.136
I remember that.
On autopsy they found

12:04.224 --> 12:06.215
he had a hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.176
Rage and tachycardia
are warning signs.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.518
Seriously?

12:10.605 --> 12:13.017
Because my brother remembers
a basketball game?

12:13.191 --> 12:15.432
Hey, I don't care
where an idea comes from,

12:15.526 --> 12:18.063
as long as it makes sense
and embarrasses someone.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.610
(DOOR OPENS)

12:20.823 --> 12:21.983
Are you out
of your mind?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.940
As a former
psychiatric patient,

12:24.035 --> 12:25.650
I take offense at
that terminology.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.986
All I did was
ban you from my tub.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.862
Whatever happened
to proportional response?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.990
Whatever happened
to coherent conversation?

12:32.126 --> 12:37.337
That thing broke tiles,
gashed the walls,
and pooped everywhere.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.957
Expect a bill for repairs.
And payback.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.172
What was that?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.552
l have no idea.

12:49.060 --> 12:53.144
Everybody else thinks
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
makes sense?

12:53.690 --> 12:55.931
Good,
stick the patient
on a treadmill.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.481
Stress his heart
until it stops.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.150
You want to induce
cardiac arrest?

13:00.571 --> 13:03.313
The only real treatment is
for the patient never to
stress his heart again,

13:03.408 --> 13:06.491
which means we have
to tell him to retire
at the ripe old age of 21.

13:06.577 --> 13:09.865
Stopping his heart
speakslouder
than words. Go.

13:14.669 --> 13:18.036
Maybe it's a good thing.
He gave your brother a job,
responsibility.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.084
I'm not arguing that
he shouldn't have a job,

13:21.175 --> 13:22.881
ljust don't want him
having one here.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.969
I understand
that House did this
to annoy you,

13:26.055 --> 13:27.215
but why is
he succeeding?

13:30.935 --> 13:31.924
(SlGHS)

13:32.061 --> 13:33.096
You know what
my brother did

13:33.187 --> 13:35.178
the last time
he got out of prison?

13:35.273 --> 13:38.515
He stole money
from my parents
to buy drugs.

13:39.110 --> 13:42.648
He robbed a liquor store,
then he moved on to
jacking luxury cars...

13:42.739 --> 13:43.945
Last time.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.272
Every time.

13:46.409 --> 13:49.321
I've known my brother
for over 30 years.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.073
You haven't even
known him a day.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.115
I'm sorry.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.628
The exterminator
charged 250

14:00.715 --> 14:01.921
to get the opossum
out of there,

14:02.050 --> 14:05.918
and the contractor
estimates 1,500
to fix the bathroom.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.929
And why are you
jerking Foreman around?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.598
Because it's fun.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.676
Maybe you should
give those bills
to the guy

14:14.771 --> 14:17.433
who left his own
bathroom window open.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.602
Your motives
always run deeper
than simple fun.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.942
I want to
learn more about
one of my employees

14:23.029 --> 14:25.020
so that I can
manipulate him

14:25.114 --> 14:29.073
and destroy him
if and when I choose.
Information is power.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.195
Not buying it.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.241
Okay.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.615
Why don't you tell me
my real evil plan?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.446
I don't think
there is an evil plan.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.704
You regret not
having a relationship
with your own family,

14:38.795 --> 14:41.286
and you don't
want to see Foreman
go down that same path.

14:41.381 --> 14:45.545
I think you're
actually being nice.

14:45.635 --> 14:46.966
Oh, shut up.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.465
You can't accuse me
of an opossum attack

14:50.556 --> 14:53.514
and underhanded kindness
in the same visit.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.678

Did I miss the memo
about you being released?

15:31.722 --> 15:33.758
I'm feeling fine.
I can't keep laying here

15:33.850 --> 15:35.340
in this bed,
missing practices.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.721
All excellent points.
Give me your arm.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.264
What's in the shot?

15:39.355 --> 15:40.515
It's a vasodilator.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.102
Since we can't exercise
your son's heart
on the treadmill,

15:43.192 --> 15:45.604
we're gonna have
to do it chemically.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.239
What's wrong?

15:52.326 --> 15:53.611
You're turning white.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.284
What does that mean?

15:55.371 --> 15:58.738
It means
he doesn't need football
to get a good job anymore.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.500
Raynaud's Phenomenon.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.254
Vasospasms cut off
the blood supply
to his fingers,

16:10.386 --> 16:12.627
could be early onset
rheumatoid arthritis.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.258
His rheumatoid
factor is negative.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.804

throwing clots

16:15.892 --> 16:17.883

a guy with stenosis

could've aced
that treadmill test?

16:23.024 --> 16:25.936
You're kidding me.
You got him a desk?

16:27.945 --> 16:31.608
And a nameplate.

he can call his own.

Takayasu's arteritis?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.486
Lymphoma's a better fit.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.693
We should remove
his spleen.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.573
Bold move to skip
straight to surgery.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.789
His big game's coming up,
we don't have time to biopsy,

16:41.918 --> 16:43.829
wait for the pathology report,
and resect.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.662
Right. We should
remove his spleen
without confirmation

16:46.756 --> 16:48.246
so he won't miss
the big game.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.173
Hang an ethanol drip.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.376
That won't treat
for either lymphoma
or Takayasu's.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.211
If it's lymphoma,
the ethanol will
make him itchy,

16:55.306 --> 16:56.796
and Foreman can
remove his spleen.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.844
If it's Takayasu's,
he'll lose his radial pulse,

16:58.935 --> 17:01.722

start him on steroids.

gave you a chance.

give you a 54th.

18:14.010 --> 18:14.999
What?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.005
That's very demeaning.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.551
You obviously
have a theory as to why
demeaning is not demeaning.

18:21.684 --> 18:25.051
You're escalating
to prove I was wrong
about you being nice.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.439
Which you would only do
if I was right.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.309
Do you even listen
to yourself?

Twenty-three-year-old
just came in to the ER,
asked for you.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.525

18:33.654 --> 18:36.862
I don't think his cup size
is relevant to his condition.

He accidentally
shot himself in the foot.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.240
Oh, for...

18:45.499 --> 18:47.239
Seriously?

18:47.376 --> 18:49.116
I give you a choice
between moving to Canada

18:49.211 --> 18:50.496
and shooting yourself
in the foot,

18:50.588 --> 18:52.124
and you choose
the bullet?

18:52.214 --> 18:53.499
I didn't want
to be a fugitive.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.422
You think this is
gonna get you discharged?

18:55.509 --> 18:56.919
We'll patch it up and
send you right back.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.089
Well, don't patch it up.

19:00.556 --> 19:04.094
Look, you got screwed over

19:04.185 --> 19:06.096
by your own government
and that sucks.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.479
But all you're going
to get out of this

19:07.563 --> 19:10.100
is a five-day vacation
and a band-aid.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.312
When I signed up,
l was just a guy.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.108
Now I'm about
to be a dad.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.694
| go back over,
there's a chance

19:16.781 --> 19:19.739
my kid grows up
without a father.

19:22.244 --> 19:26.157
You got a girl pregnant.
You're still just a guy.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.256
How much longer
we have to wait?

19:38.344 --> 19:40.710
We have to keep going
until you start
feeling something.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.046
Might help if you told me
what I'm supposed to feel.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.256
I do that, that's all
you'll be thinking about.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.307
Then you'll be telling me
that's what you're feeling.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.767
Power of suggestion.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.017
The other black dude
who was in here earlier,
he your brother?

19:52.108 --> 19:53.518
What gave it away?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.190
The way you looked at him.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.689
l have two older brothers,

Something wrong?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.868
Not really.
Just feels itchy.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.079
Is that what you
were waiting for?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.081
Means lymphoma's
most likely.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.753
But that's
actually good news.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.126
How can that
be good news?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.548
Because it's treatable,

20:19.635 --> 20:21.967
we can remove
your spleen tonight
laparoscopically.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.669
Will I be up and
around by Saturday?

20:23.806 --> 20:26.172
We can get
to the radiation

that I didn't pull.

lt's karmicjustice,
but I didn't do it.

Of course you realize,
this means war.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.737
Nearly there.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.116
Foreman, come and
take a look at this.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.491
Liver's inflamed.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.879
So the itching wasn't
caused by his spleen.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.251
It's not lymphoma.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.094
What happened
to your face?

22:33.185 --> 22:35.767
Wilson annexed
the Sudetenland.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.096
FOREMAN: No abnormal
T-cells or B-cells,

22:38.190 --> 22:39.771
it's definitely
not lymphoma.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.647
Liver biopsy only revealed
non-specific inflammation.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.235
Kind of like the time

22:45.322 --> 22:47.904
you took your mom's
birth control pills
on a dare

22:47.992 --> 22:49.948
and ended up with
swollen nipples.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.616
Thatneverhappened.
Right.

22:51.704 --> 22:55.071
And your nickname
all the way up through
high school wasn't Erica.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.621
It wasn't.

22:58.627 --> 22:59.958
Okay, I may have
made that one up.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.377
With the understanding
that my brother still
had his sense of humor

23:02.464 --> 23:03.715
and would figure
out to play along.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.881
Polymyositis would
explain the head,

23:05.968 --> 23:07.674
liver, heart,
even the white fingers.

23:07.803 --> 23:11.341
Would also be accompanied
by a significant decrease
in muscle power.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.215
Marcus, chance to
redeem yourself.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.346
Does our patient
look strong to you?

23:18.814 --> 23:22.181
Sorry, Eric.
Big brother disagrees
with your diagnosis.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.398
Felty syndrome?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.771
You said the liver
was inflamed,
not the spleen.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.650
Can you believe
they let this guy
perform surgery?

23:28.741 --> 23:29.730
What are you doing?

23:29.825 --> 23:31.065
Requesting permission
to share my idea

23:31.160 --> 23:33.276
without being
belittled in front of
your new assistant.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.747
Permission denied.
Conﬂnue.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.531
Our patient has
cartilage damage
in both ankles,

23:38.667 --> 23:41.204
he gets lidocaine shots
before every game
to mask the pain.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.329
Team doctor uses
the same needle twice
by accident?

23:44.423 --> 23:45.458
Viral hepatitis.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.756
Do you think
he's an idiot,
Marcus?

23:47.843 --> 23:49.344
I don't think
he's an idiot.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.510
Okay.
Go test his blood.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.381
Come on. We have
a lunch scheduled.

23:59.521 --> 24:02.433
So you jerked me around.

24:03.609 --> 24:07.568
Your allegiance lies
with your brother.
I get it. Admirable.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.855
But here's the problem.
I hired you to
tell me the truth.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.532
If you don't do that,
you no longer have a job.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.450
I don't know what secret
you're looking to uncover,

24:15.537 --> 24:17.528
but my brother
is a decent guy.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.080
He was arrested
for grand theft auto.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.120
You're gonna
be disappointed.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.371
Try me.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.295
He tell you
lwas with him?

24:26.382 --> 24:27.542
Was it your idea?

24:27.633 --> 24:28.622
We did everything
together,

24:28.717 --> 24:29.752
I don't know
whose idea it was.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.841
lwas 16,
he was only 14.

24:31.929 --> 24:34.386
Little punk couldn't
even see over
the steering wheel,

24:34.473 --> 24:35.974
but he was quicker
with a flathead screwdriver

24:36.058 --> 24:39.300
than most people
with a key.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.982
Sorry to interrupt
my character assassination
with boring medical stuff,

24:46.068 --> 24:47.558
but when we drew
the patient's blood

24:47.653 --> 24:49.689
it clotted right there
in the vacutainer.

24:49.780 --> 24:53.398
So the problem is
not in his blood,
it's the blood itself.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.448
He's been working out
in the cold,
doing two-a-days,

24:55.577 --> 24:57.613
it's got to be
cryoglobulinemia.

24:57.746 --> 25:01.238
IusuaHylove
breaking bad news,
but in this case...

25:01.667 --> 25:04.124
Start the patient
on warfarin.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.628
I am so sorry about that.
You were saying?

25:10.300 --> 25:11.506
We drove for
about 10 minutes

25:11.593 --> 25:14.380
before we got caught
and that was it.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.847
When mom came
down to the station,

25:15.931 --> 25:18.968
she didn't say a word
the whole ride home.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.802
She came to the driveway,
turned off the car.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.273
We're sitting in there
in silence.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.517
And then,
without turning around,

25:26.608 --> 25:29.600
she said,
"I'll pray for you."

25:31.321 --> 25:33.698
Then she got
out of the car.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.863
Wow. You got off easy.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.946
Easy for you,
easy for me.
Not easy for Eric.

25:42.833 --> 25:46.417
His life mission became
to never disappoint our
mother like that again.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.370
Because he is
a good guy.

25:50.758 --> 25:54.046
Thought he would
tell that story
at the eulogy,

25:54.136 --> 25:55.546
but I heard
he didn't give one.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.174
Your mother's dead?

26:03.687 --> 26:06.929
If he didn't tell you,
I'm sure he had a reason.

26:07.024 --> 26:11.518
Look, you can
mock him all you want
about peeing the bed,

26:13.030 --> 26:17.069
but please don't
bring up our mother.

26:21.663 --> 26:24.905
Your blood contains
an abnormally high volume
of certain proteins,

26:25.000 --> 26:26.285
called cryoglobulins.

26:26.543 --> 26:29.034
They become thick
when it gets cold outside.

26:29.129 --> 26:32.371
It's like a car trying
to run after the oil's
turned to sludge.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.673
We think that's
what's been causing
all your problems.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.968
So ljust need
a quick oil change
and I'm good to go.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.137
This oil change
isn't so quick.

26:40.224 --> 26:42.806
We have to put you
on blood thinners
and other medications.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.929
The process will take
two to three weeks,

26:45.020 --> 26:47.727
but after that,
you should be able to
play without a problem.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.351
After that,
it's not gonna matter.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.727
Doctor,
if Daryl doesn't play
in front of the scouts

26:51.819 --> 26:53.684
on Saturday,
he won't get drafted.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.485
Can't you wait
until after the game?

26:55.572 --> 26:58.063
If we wait
and let him play,

26:58.158 --> 27:01.491
there's a good chance
he dies right on the field.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.706
I had an epiphany.

27:15.801 --> 27:19.714
Usually that precedes
you walking away
with purpose, so...

27:20.389 --> 27:22.596
Flathead screwdriver.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.548
And then I say...

27:24.893 --> 27:27.509
It's not a game,
it's proof

27:27.604 --> 27:29.435
that you didn't
rig the grab rail
and make me fall.

27:29.523 --> 27:30.808
I already have
proof of that.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.810
The fact that
I didn't do it.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.061
I can't go on that.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.313
But I can go
on the fact

27:35.404 --> 27:37.770
that I had to borrow
a flathead screwdriver
from Nora

27:37.865 --> 27:40.106
to install the thing
because we only
had a Phillips head.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.111
Then, of course,
I returned it
late that night

27:42.202 --> 27:44.864
in a completely
successful effort
to see her braless.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.491
Whoa! Wait.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

27:46.582 --> 27:50.120
Which means that you
didn't have the tool
to sabotage the grab rail.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.826
Braless? Under, like,
a sweater? Or, like, a...

27:52.921 --> 27:56.834
Now I also have proof
that I'm not responsible
for the opossum

27:56.925 --> 27:59.462
because I'm absolving you
of responsibility
instead of escalating,

27:59.553 --> 28:01.089
which you know is
not in my nature.

28:01.180 --> 28:05.719
So someone is
breaking into our place
just to screw with us?

28:05.809 --> 28:09.597
The opossum
was meant for me.

28:14.234 --> 28:18.728
WILSON: I'm so tired.
It was exciting
until about 2:00 am.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.439
Now it's just torture.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.148
HOUSE: Did you even go
to college?

28:24.286 --> 28:27.198
This is the escalation,
isn't it?

28:27.289 --> 28:28.529
Keeping me up
all night.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.536
Nothing happens,
then you keep me up
all night again tomorrow.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.117
This is your retaliation.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.544
You see,
that's just illogical,

28:35.631 --> 28:37.167
'cause I'm
staying up, too.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.543
Maybe you napped all day.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.967
I gave you empirical proof
that I did not prank you.

28:42.095 --> 28:45.633
No. No, you did not.
You created
empirical proof

28:45.766 --> 28:47.176
that I didn't
prank you,

28:47.267 --> 28:50.304
selling me on the notion
that you didn't prank me.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.849
Maybe you self-pranked.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.225
I don't masterprank.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.978
Is that cut on
your cheek even real?

28:57.110 --> 29:01.900
See? This is exactly
what our nemesis wants.
Divide and conquer.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.241
Can't you see that?

29:03.325 --> 29:06.067
Okay.
I'm going to bed.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.284
HOUSE: I'm telling you,
ifwe sleep now,

29:08.455 --> 29:10.992
we're going to wake up
next to severed horse heads.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.493
Or worse, the rest of it.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.451
(FIRE ALARM BEEPING)

29:16.463 --> 29:17.873
WILSON: Oh!

29:19.675 --> 29:20.835
House!

29:24.012 --> 29:25.627
The flatscreen!

29:40.195 --> 29:43.028
You would never
sacrifice the flatscreen.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.777
Oh, this guy's good.

29:52.374 --> 29:53.409
(SIGHS)

29:53.500 --> 29:54.956
Is there a reason
for this?

29:58.297 --> 30:03.462
(IN FRENCH ACCENT)
There is a reason
for everything, mes amis.

30:03.719 --> 30:09.305
I am troubled to report
that we have a criminal
in our midst.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.681
Guilty of what,
exacﬂy?

30:12.311 --> 30:15.394
Last night
the fire sprinklers
flooded our apartment.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.268
And before that,
I found an opossum
in my bathtub.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.772
You each had motive,
you each had opportunity.

30:23.405 --> 30:26.317
This is the emergency
you paged me about?

30:26.408 --> 30:27.443
(CLEARS THROAT)

30:27.534 --> 30:30.526
Not so fast,
Mademoiselle Cuddy.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.531
No one leaves here
until they can account

30:32.622 --> 30:35.750
for their whereabouts
the evening last.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.043
Bye.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.748
(IN NORMAL ACCENT)
Okay. No one who
is employed by me

30:40.839 --> 30:41.999
leaves here until
they account

30:42.090 --> 30:43.796
for their whereabouts
the evening last.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.091
What about you,
Professor Chase?

30:46.178 --> 30:47.384
Why would I?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.544
Because you
hold me responsible

30:49.639 --> 30:51.175
for breaking up
your marriage.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.847
I was here all night
with Thirteen

30:52.934 --> 30:56.176
monitoring our patient's
IV blood thinners.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.720
Can either of you
prove that?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.850
The patient's alive
and improving.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.101
Is that proof enough?

31:01.193 --> 31:02.308
For now.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.859
What about you,
Colonel Taub?

31:04.946 --> 31:07.232
I was out to dinner
with my wife.

31:07.324 --> 31:09.690
Really? Your wife?

31:09.785 --> 31:11.616
Yes, really.

31:12.829 --> 31:16.367
Good enough.
'Cause I had you
pegged all along.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.533
You certainly
had all the motive
in the world.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.710
First of all,
I'm not interested.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.709
Second, I don't even know
where you guys live.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.758
Yesterday, I confirmed
that you are a liar.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.129
What are you
talking about?

31:29.221 --> 31:31.837
Well, at least
a liar by omission.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.012
House!

31:35.811 --> 31:36.846
Don't.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.683
Get this, class.
Foreman's mom died.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.976
He ever tell any of you?

31:46.071 --> 31:49.279
House, I think you're
getting off topic here.

31:49.366 --> 31:52.199
Is he serious?
Did your mom pass away?

31:53.412 --> 31:55.368
About three months ago.

31:55.455 --> 31:56.740
I'm so sorry.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.163
Why didn't you
tell anybody?

31:58.250 --> 31:59.740
HOUSE: And to top it off,

31:59.835 --> 32:02.326
he refused to say
anything nice about her
at the funeral.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.037
I didn't talk because
it isn't anyone's business.

32:05.132 --> 32:09.091
Stop. You don't have
to explain yourself
to this guy.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.508
You want to hit me,
don't you?

32:10.595 --> 32:12.506
Marcus, don't.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.303
I quit.

32:22.983 --> 32:25.315
You should stop him.
He needs this job.

32:25.402 --> 32:28.519
Our patient
needs a fresh IV.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.159
I don't need two
to three weeks.

32:40.250 --> 32:43.242
See?
Got my color back.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.126
It means you're
getting better,
but it doesn't...

32:45.213 --> 32:48.671
Means I am better.
My coach had
the team doctor come by.

32:48.758 --> 32:49.838
He cleared me to play.

32:49.926 --> 32:53.510
Did your team doctor realize
you're on blood thinners?

32:56.224 --> 32:57.179
I'm off them now.

32:57.267 --> 32:58.347
You're still sick.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.016
You're not ready
to go off your meds.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.968
Daryl, listen to him.
It is not worth the risk...

33:02.063 --> 33:04.224
I'll come back
on Sunday, Mom.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.897
You guys can give me
all the meds I need then.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.566
The treatment
doesn't work that way.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.232
Please, go with him.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.041
The antibiotics
aren't working.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.087
We're going to switch you
to different ones,

33:30.467 --> 33:33.004
but you're going
to lose your toe.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.051
(LAUGHING)

33:38.600 --> 33:40.340
Outstanding, soldier!

33:40.435 --> 33:44.519
As a general rule,
before you celebrate,
do a little research.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.264
The Army's Medical
Evaluation Board

33:47.359 --> 33:50.351
is perfectly fine with
nine-toed infantrymen,

33:50.445 --> 33:52.936
as long as they
can walk and run.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.859
So I lost a toe
for nothing?

33:54.950 --> 33:56.156
Afraid so.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.199
Unless you want me
to keep you
on the old antibiotics.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.572
We can let
the infection spread,

34:00.664 --> 34:03.246
then we can amputate
more than just a toe.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.295
Why are you risking
your life for this?

34:11.383 --> 34:13.795
Your mom doesn't
want you to.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.835
My mom sacrificed
everything for me.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.386
Her telling me
not to come here

34:18.473 --> 34:20.429
is just another
example of that.

34:20.517 --> 34:22.223
I do good out there,

34:22.310 --> 34:25.052
I could take care of her
for the rest of her life.

34:27.607 --> 34:31.725
Who am I if I don't
sacrifice for her?
That's family.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.155
(DARYL WHEEZING)

34:54.301 --> 34:57.043
You okay?

34:57.137 --> 34:58.422
Everything's blurry.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.467
I can't see.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.686
Take me back
to the hospital.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.525
The blindness means
we were wrong about...

35:22.621 --> 35:25.283
FOREMAN: Actually,
I’m responsible for that.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.661
I spiked his water
bottle with nitrates.
Dropped his blood pressure,

35:28.793 --> 35:31.785
robbed oxygen rich
blood from his brain,
making him blind.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.461
I figured
a temporarily
blind patient

35:33.548 --> 35:35.288
is better than
a permanently dead one.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.543
His vision was
already coming back

35:36.635 --> 35:38.091
by the time
I dropped him off
at the hospital.

35:39.971 --> 35:43.463
Well played.
If only we could combine
your medical chicanery

35:43.558 --> 35:45.469
with your brother's
ability to fetch me mochas,

35:45.560 --> 35:47.266
you'd be
the perfect Foreman.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.309
Where are you?

35:48.396 --> 35:49.511
I'm busy.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.058
TAUB: Great, so we don't
have a new symptom.

35:54.194 --> 35:56.230
Means we should
just stick him back
on his blood thinners,

35:56.321 --> 35:57.811
and he should
be okay to leave
in a couple weeks.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.067
Actually, we do
have a new symptom.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.692
Any of you take a look
at his readmittance chart?

36:04.412 --> 36:05.492
Between the time
he checked in

36:05.580 --> 36:06.660
and the time
he re-checked in,

36:06.748 --> 36:09.239
our patient lost
a single pound.

36:09.668 --> 36:12.580
Patient like that
would usually shed
over 10 pounds.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.670
The obvious answer
would be steroids,

36:15.757 --> 36:17.748
but since we've
already ruled them out...

36:17.884 --> 36:21.923
So he's not injecting,
but he could be
getting them naturally.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.841
Paraneoplastic syndrome,

36:23.932 --> 36:26.514
the body
produces antibodies
which battle cancer,

36:26.601 --> 36:28.262
which could also act
like growth hormone.

36:28.353 --> 36:32.346
We've eliminated lymphoma.
What other cancers
mimic growth hormone?

36:32.440 --> 36:34.351
Lung, pancreatic,
renal, breast...

36:34.442 --> 36:36.933
It was a rhetorical question,
I don't really care.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.606
Go test him
for all of them.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.944
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

36:51.292 --> 36:52.577
What are you doing here?

36:52.669 --> 36:54.250
You need a job.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.206
Maybe I can
talk to House,

36:59.300 --> 37:00.881
see if I can get
yourjob back.

37:02.387 --> 37:06.050
As soon as he knows
you're okay with me
being there,

37:06.141 --> 37:07.472
he won't want me back.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.968
Maybe I can help you
figure out something else.

37:11.646 --> 37:15.980
I promise
I won't let you down.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.807
Don't do that.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.488
Let's just see
how it goes.

37:25.952 --> 37:30.491
So do they
mandate you to stay here
at the halfway house,

37:32.333 --> 37:35.666
or can you come stay
with family?

37:49.559 --> 37:50.765
It's Foreman.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.059
Well, it should stop
now that Marcus left.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.886
Well, that's
the whole point.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.977
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was my leg sticking out?

38:02.071 --> 38:04.528
I'm so distracted lately,
trying to think of
something funnier

38:04.616 --> 38:05.947
than fire sprinklers
going off

38:06.034 --> 38:09.026
in the middle of the night.
Any ideas?

38:11.956 --> 38:15.289
Whoa. Easy there, tiger.
I know where you live.
You know how I know?

38:15.376 --> 38:17.241
'Cause my girlfriend
and I,

38:17.337 --> 38:19.703
we tried to buy
that very same condo.

38:19.798 --> 38:20.878
Why don't you
leave me out of this?

38:20.965 --> 38:22.580
Wilson was the one
who bought the place.

38:22.675 --> 38:27.920
And you're living there.
You deserve to
suffer equally.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.630
Actually, I've suffered more
now that you just tripped me.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.306
(STAMMERING)
Hey, hey. I'm...

38:32.393 --> 38:35.135
His suffering will
equal out because he
actually feels remorse.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.016
Why would you
out yourself?

38:37.106 --> 38:39.518
You can't even imagine
the retribution.

38:39.609 --> 38:43.898
There won't be any.
I'm ceasing all
offensive operations.

38:43.988 --> 38:47.230
I've both made my point
and established
my superiority.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.442
And if you even get
to the planning stages
of retaliation,

38:50.537 --> 38:53.779
I will tell Cuddy that
she lost her dream place
to you two.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.488
See, she's under
this odd impression

38:55.583 --> 38:58.245
that you guys
are her friends.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.389
There's no cancer.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.765
We scanned him
head to toe,

39:18.857 --> 39:20.347
we checked blood smears
for leukemia,

39:20.441 --> 39:22.932
we even
ultrasounded his chest
looking for breast cancer.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.813
Maybe I was wrong
about the weight loss.

39:24.904 --> 39:27.316
You weren't wrong.
We found blood in
his catheter bag.

39:27.407 --> 39:28.613
His kidneys are failing.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.860
THIRTEEN:
So it has to be cancer.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.033
Paraneoplastic syndrome
is the only thing

39:32.120 --> 39:34.156
that can link kidney,
heart and liver,

39:34.247 --> 39:35.236
even the rage.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.707
Then why can't
we find it?

39:36.791 --> 39:39.703
We've looked everywhere
inside this guy.

39:39.919 --> 39:42.205
What if it's not inside?

39:49.012 --> 39:50.502
(MAN CHATTERING ON TV)

39:57.854 --> 39:59.685
You know why
you're black?

39:59.772 --> 40:02.263
'Cause God loves me
more than he loves you.

40:02.358 --> 40:06.271
Hmm. What I was going
for was melanin.
You got lots of it.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.860
Makes your skin dark,

40:07.947 --> 40:10.529
protects you from
the sun's harmful UV rays.

40:10.617 --> 40:11.732
What are you doing?

40:11.826 --> 40:13.236
Unfortunately,
it also prevents

40:13.328 --> 40:15.193
even those with advanced
medical degrees

40:15.288 --> 40:19.372
from considering
melanoma as a diagnosis.
Other hand.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.368
On the rare occasion
that black people
do get skin cancer,

40:23.463 --> 40:25.670
they usually get it
on their white parts,

40:25.757 --> 40:28.339
like the palms and
soles of the feet.

40:28.426 --> 40:32.510
But your hands and feet
are so smashed up
from football

40:32.889 --> 40:35.175
that my team would
likely have written off

40:35.266 --> 40:37.427
any skin blemish
as a bruise.

40:37.685 --> 40:42.019
But now that I know
that melanoma is the
only thing that fits...

40:43.942 --> 40:46.433
Come take
a look at this, Mom.

40:49.739 --> 40:54.403
There's the thorn
in the panther's paw.
Paraneoplastic syndrome.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.577
Your body forms antibodies
to fight the tumor.

40:57.664 --> 41:01.532
Those tiny little proteins
travel through your blood
and wreak havoc.

41:01.626 --> 41:04.993
We remove the cancerous mole,
everything should be fine.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.955
I'll tell Dr. Chase
to schedule the surgery.

41:08.341 --> 41:12.209
Why bother?
I missed my shot.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.089
What kind of life
am I gonna lead now?

41:14.263 --> 41:16.879
Did you study really,
really hard?

41:18.977 --> 41:20.592
Then the same crappy life

41:20.687 --> 41:24.020
that the rest of the guys
you'll be graduating
with are going to lead,

41:24.107 --> 41:26.189
minus the student loans.

41:31.823 --> 41:32.983
Hey, you ready?

41:33.074 --> 41:34.154
Almost.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.447
And done.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.242
I heard House and Wilson
are getting pranked
by someone.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.415
You wouldn't know
anything about that,
would you?

41:44.502 --> 41:45.617
No.

41:46.045 --> 41:47.831
And why should
I believe you?

41:47.922 --> 41:50.083
You said I had
a trusting face.

41:50.466 --> 41:53.708
I still don't understand
why you wouldn't let
me retaliate, though.

41:53.803 --> 41:55.293
They stole your dream.

41:55.388 --> 41:58.130
Well, that's overstating it.
It's just a condo.

41:58.224 --> 42:01.762
It's not because
you feel guilty
about hurting House?

42:01.853 --> 42:03.764
Or guilty for
being with me?

42:03.855 --> 42:05.436
We'll buy another one.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.354
ljust don't see the need
to make a war out of it.

42:07.442 --> 42:08.807
Well, I think
you're rationalizing,

42:08.901 --> 42:10.277
which a less confident man
than myself

42:10.361 --> 42:13.398
might take as a sign
that you're
second guessing...

42:13.948 --> 42:16.655
Okay. You know what?
Forget that last part.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.905
I heard Foreman
and his brother

42:20.997 --> 42:23.113
are trying to
work things out.

42:23.207 --> 42:24.196
That's nice for them.

42:24.292 --> 42:26.408
It's nice of you.

42:27.628 --> 42:30.961
You didn't
provoke Marcus to quit
so the pranks would stop.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.506
You were becoming
the common enemy
they could bond over.

42:33.593 --> 42:37.882
You are the diabolical,
yet benevolent puppetmaster.

42:38.056 --> 42:42.174
I provoked Marcus to quit
because he was no longer
useful to me.

42:42.268 --> 42:44.350
I hired him to
get information,
I got information.

42:44.437 --> 42:45.677
Uh-huh.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.763
And how are we going
to get back at Lucas?

42:47.857 --> 42:49.222
We're not.

42:51.319 --> 42:52.604
Iwin.
