00:00.001 --> 00:02.374
<i>Previously on ‘Boston Legal’</i>
…that your Honor recuse herself.
–Yes, Alan.

00:02.414 --> 00:04.678
And the wheels of justice
would grind to a halt

00:04.718 --> 00:07.087
if we recuse every jurist
you've slept with.

00:07.127 --> 00:08.630
I'm ready to be disciplined now.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.112
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning.

00:26.969 --> 00:30.005
I want to see a name partner, like…

00:30.005 --> 00:32.402
Crane's probably dead…

00:32.402 --> 00:34.786
Schmidt's some kind of minority,
so, uh, Poole.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.733
I'll take Poole.

00:35.773 --> 00:37.941
Denny Crane, still alive.

00:37.941 --> 00:39.886
I was told your firm is the best.
I need the best.

00:39.926 --> 00:41.286
That would be me.
Who are you?

00:41.326 --> 00:42.842
Simon Griffin.
Don't worry.

00:42.882 --> 00:45.181
That name will soon be embedded
in your head forever,

00:45.221 --> 00:47.290
like Jonas Salk or Paris Hilton.

00:47.330 --> 00:48.260
Can't wait.

00:48.260 --> 00:49.836
I had HIV.

00:49.836 --> 00:53.103
I beat it.
I'm a walking AIDS cure.

00:53.103 --> 00:56.188
Now I want to cash in, hmm?

00:56.460 --> 00:57.432
Is this for real?

00:57.472 --> 01:00.973
I tested HIV positive
for the first time in 2005

01:00.973 --> 01:02.924
and then once a month the year after.

01:02.964 --> 01:05.519
I just didn't want to
accept a death sentence.

01:05.559 --> 01:07.372
I kept thinking a miracle would happen.

01:07.412 --> 01:09.571
And then, 3 months ago, it did.

01:09.571 --> 01:11.749
I went negative.

01:12.344 --> 01:14.451
–You've had that rechecked?
–Every other week since.

01:14.491 --> 01:18.748
Dr Freemont, my internist,
just confirmed I'm spontaneously cured.

01:18.788 --> 01:21.776
Actually, I've heard of
spontaneous cures for cancer,

01:21.816 --> 01:23.590
but never for HIV.
–You need to keep up.

01:23.630 --> 01:26.629
I'm the first American whose blood
sero-converts without treatment.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.356
No medications, nothing.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.221
There's one other guy in England.

01:30.261 --> 01:33.874
In the States, my body is
the first to fight off HIV.

01:33.874 --> 01:35.581
Assuming you check out,

01:35.581 --> 01:38.003
how exactly can our firm help you?

01:38.003 --> 01:41.371
I need a team to negotiate
book deals, TV appearances…

01:41.411 --> 01:42.792
not to sound materialistic.

01:42.832 --> 01:44.227
Not to.

01:45.019 --> 01:48.989
Shouldn't you be letting doctors
examine you on the chance that,

01:49.029 --> 01:51.245
you know, you could help others?
Just a thought.

01:51.285 --> 01:52.657
I'll get to that.

01:52.657 --> 01:56.393
But how I see myself in the big picture
is as an ambassador,

01:56.433 --> 01:59.342
someone everybody knows about
and probably desires to be like,

01:59.382 --> 02:02.755
somebody who inspires others.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.770
Mainly, I see myself rich.

I'm here to see Alan Shore.

02:57.007 --> 02:58.443
Okay, is he expecting you?

02:58.483 --> 03:01.025
They never expect me.
They always see me.

03:01.065 --> 03:02.802
I'm judge Gloria Weldon.

03:02.802 --> 03:04.924
Mr Shore should be in any moment.

03:04.964 --> 03:07.274
Would you like to wait?
–Thank you.

03:10.355 --> 03:11.739
Your honor.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.609
It was a pleasure to see you.

03:15.497 --> 03:16.951
Please.

03:19.088 --> 03:25.900
Are you familiar with the Amazonian plants
<i>psychotria viridis</i> and <i>banisteriopsis caapi</i> ?

03:25.900 --> 03:26.905
No.

03:26.905 --> 03:28.399
You brew the two together,

03:28.439 --> 03:30.645
and you arrive at a tea called <i>hoasca</i>.

03:30.685 --> 03:32.567
They call it “the vine of the soul.”

03:32.607 --> 03:37.012
You get a 2-minute peak followed
by a 30-minute brain cruise.

03:37.012 --> 03:38.786
Also illegal.

03:38.786 --> 03:42.540
After work, I imbibe—
in my chambers, privately.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.253
Last Wednesday evening,
without my knowledge,

03:45.293 --> 03:48.483
one of my clerks
managed to help himself.

03:48.483 --> 03:50.120
He got high as a kite,

03:50.120 --> 03:53.022
did a naked dance
on the courthouse steps.

03:53.022 --> 03:56.472
Caught, scared, he led
the police back to me.

03:56.472 --> 04:01.071
I have been arrested for importation
and possession of a schedule 1 narcotic.

04:01.111 --> 04:03.184
That's a buzzkill.

04:03.421 --> 04:06.952
I love my job, Alan.
I'm good at my job.

04:06.952 --> 04:08.315
You have to be creative.

04:08.355 --> 04:09.718
Assuming I take the case—

04:09.758 --> 04:11.642
–You already took the case.
–Says who?

04:11.682 --> 04:14.585
Says me.
I'm the judge.

04:24.869 --> 04:26.935
Once we make a deal with
a pharmaceutical company,

04:26.975 --> 04:30.933
then I'll have the resources to launch
my new persona as a spokesperson.

04:30.973 --> 04:34.470
Talk shows, reality shows,
photo ops in Africa,

04:34.470 --> 04:37.751
a constant reminder of the message
of hope that I represent.

04:37.791 --> 04:38.989
I'm welling up.

04:38.989 --> 04:42.223
I can see you're cynical.
We'll make a good team.

04:43.279 --> 04:44.659
Dr Freemont?

04:44.659 --> 04:46.559
–Hello, Simon.
–You two know each other?

04:46.599 --> 04:48.914
We know each other quite well,
don't we, Simon?

04:48.954 --> 04:50.344
Who is this man, Simon?

04:50.384 --> 04:52.147
My internist.

04:52.147 --> 04:53.889
Have I got it again?

04:53.889 --> 04:56.011
No, uh, that's not it.

04:56.011 --> 04:59.348
Okay, will somebody tell me
what the hell is going on here?

04:59.388 --> 05:02.358
Mr Griffin is trying to sell his blood.
That can't happen.

05:02.398 --> 05:05.312
–Why not?
–Because I own it.

05:05.667 --> 05:06.887
You own my blood?

05:06.887 --> 05:09.647
I applied for a patent
on your DNA and I got it,

05:09.687 --> 05:13.826
so, yes, I own it.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.277
I go to Newton college.
It's an excellent school.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.550
I have no issue with them.

05:18.590 --> 05:21.658
It's the sorority I belong to
—or used to, I should say—

05:21.698 --> 05:23.749
gamma kappa tau (ΓΚΤ).
It's a national sorority,

05:23.789 --> 05:26.105
and recently, the national
officers visited campus

05:26.145 --> 05:28.548
and conducted some sort of campus survey.

05:28.588 --> 05:30.214
If I start to talk too fast,
just tell me.

05:30.254 --> 05:32.095
I tend to speed up towards
the middle of paragraphs.

05:32.135 --> 05:33.534
It's fine.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.403
Anyways, according to this campus poll,

05:35.443 --> 05:40.427
the members of ΓΚΤ at Newton
were perceived as socially awkward.

05:40.427 --> 05:44.107
As a result, the national officer
sort of directed the campus chapter

05:44.147 --> 05:46.188
to clean up its image, so to speak.

05:46.228 --> 05:48.820
Mint?
–No, thanks.

05:48.820 --> 05:51.217
Anyway, we all got interviewed,

05:51.217 --> 05:54.379
after which, about half of us
were invited to leave—

05:54.419 --> 05:56.436
told to leave, I should say.

05:56.436 --> 06:00.005
Mainly, it was a group of thin, pretty,
popular girls who got to stay.

06:00.045 --> 06:02.804
The rest of us got bounced.

06:02.804 --> 06:05.991
What reason did they give
for kicking you out?

06:05.991 --> 06:08.874
They said that we failed to live
up to the sorority's criteria,

06:08.914 --> 06:10.691
and when I pushed them on it…

06:10.731 --> 06:12.443
—I can be a little pushy—

06:12.443 --> 06:17.001
they added that to my list
of offenses, “too pushy.”

06:17.001 --> 06:19.382
I think it's wrong.

06:20.225 --> 06:22.149
Can you help me?

06:23.156 --> 06:25.066
I'll help you.

06:34.820 --> 06:38.536
Denise, um, I, I have this, uh…

06:53.179 --> 06:56.039
Under the law,
you're completely guilty.

06:56.786 --> 06:59.584
I wish I could be more optimistic.

07:00.354 --> 07:01.959
Alan…

07:02.899 --> 07:06.609
do you think I came to you
for an interpretation of the law?

07:06.649 --> 07:09.321
I hired you because you get people off.

07:09.321 --> 07:12.105
I would like you to get me—

07:13.716 --> 07:17.108
I know you can come up
with something.

07:17.342 --> 07:22.845
Can we offer any medical reason
for you needing to drink this tea?

07:24.806 --> 07:26.663
Stress?

07:29.455 --> 07:33.064
The DA's immediate boss, um…

07:33.064 --> 07:38.351
there's a possibility that
he may be on a little witch hunt.

07:38.351 --> 07:40.457
We were once involved, briefly.

07:40.457 --> 07:42.911
Now we're getting somewhere.

07:42.911 --> 07:44.609
It ended poorly?

07:44.609 --> 07:45.994
For him.

07:45.994 --> 07:47.766
But he's not the guy handling this.

07:47.806 --> 07:53.768
The case went to somebody who would
love to make a name for himself by nailing…

07:53.768 --> 07:56.031
convicting me.

07:57.259 --> 07:58.408
Denny, this is…

07:58.408 --> 07:59.960
Hello.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.625
Judge Weldon.
She's in some legal trouble.

08:02.665 --> 08:05.899
We may need to trade
on some of your connections.

08:07.411 --> 08:10.308
Yes, now that your legal analysis
is out of the way,

08:10.348 --> 08:12.745
let's turn to politics.
Who do you know in the DA's office?

08:12.785 --> 08:16.024
I know everybody.
I'd like to get to know you better.

08:16.064 --> 08:19.589
Denny, we have a bit of a situation here.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.377
Denny?

08:25.765 --> 08:27.538
Denny?

08:29.017 --> 08:30.229
You need to fix this.

08:30.269 --> 08:33.520
You people are supposed
to be so fancy and good.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.664
Uh, from what I can tell,
the law is not definitive.

08:37.664 --> 08:39.390
Anything in your body belongs to you.

08:39.429 --> 08:42.842
Once it's excised,
the legal status is debatable.

08:42.842 --> 08:44.705
That's ridiculous.
It's my blood.

08:44.745 --> 08:47.851
Yes, but Dr Freemont has
a patent on the DNA.

08:47.851 --> 08:49.816
It's my blood.

08:49.816 --> 08:51.538
God knows I'm the one
who had to suffer with it.

08:51.578 --> 08:53.843
Why can't I be the one who—

08:54.164 --> 08:56.054
Go ahead, you can say it: “profits.”

08:56.094 --> 08:59.378
The pharmaceutical companies
think that's a lovely word.

08:59.418 --> 09:01.519
What are my options?

09:01.519 --> 09:03.150
Well, first thing,

09:03.150 --> 09:06.819
we could go to court
and challenge the doctor's claim.

09:06.819 --> 09:08.372
Although as crazy as it may seem,

09:08.412 --> 09:11.567
public policy may side with him,
since he's in it for the cure,

09:11.607 --> 09:15.811
and you, as you say,
mainly just want to be rich.

09:20.191 --> 09:23.065
For the purposes of this meeting,
let me do the talking.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.326
Of course. I would never.

09:25.936 --> 09:28.853
Hello, my name is—

09:29.977 --> 09:31.646
You?

09:32.001 --> 09:34.689
Good morning.
Jerry Espenson, Pat Ontario.

09:34.729 --> 09:37.340
She's the national president of
the sorority ΓΚΤ.

09:37.380 --> 09:39.101
How may we help you?

09:39.101 --> 09:40.670
Well…

09:41.581 --> 09:45.028
your client, or an agent thereof,

09:45.028 --> 09:48.217
expelled my client
for being socially awkward.

09:48.217 --> 09:49.883
Uh, that's not exactly true.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.455
Pat. That allegation is
without basis.

09:52.455 --> 09:54.518
I'm sorry,
but leaving the merits aside,

09:54.558 --> 09:56.487
what remedy is your client
seeking here?

09:56.527 --> 10:02.335
Does she long to become a member of a club
that's not terribly enthusiastic to have her?

10:03.253 --> 10:05.854
–That was mean.
–My intent is only to be pragmatic.

10:05.894 --> 10:07.929
Lawsuits are very costly.

10:07.929 --> 10:13.056
I'm just looking to appreciate what it is
your client is specifically after.

10:14.723 --> 10:16.842
$10 million.

10:17.842 --> 10:19.195
Be serious, please.

10:19.195 --> 10:21.662
$15 million.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.401
Clarence, may I call you Clarence?

10:23.441 --> 10:24.771
20!

10:24.771 --> 10:26.655
Let's go.
I'm done.

10:26.655 --> 10:30.824
You are a mean, mean, mean woman.

10:52.903 --> 10:55.685
It seems Denny has struck out
with his connections.

10:55.725 --> 10:57.246
Unless I'm making one here.

10:57.286 --> 11:02.631
My only play is to convince this
district attorney not to bring charges.

11:02.631 --> 11:03.900
How do you plan to do that?

11:03.940 --> 11:07.647
Well, you say he's a political creature.
You're a very influential judge.

11:07.687 --> 11:10.873
Alan, if these charges stick,
I won't be a judge any longer.

11:10.913 --> 11:12.743
Gloria, I don't know
what else to tell you.

11:12.783 --> 11:16.027
We face a very difficult row here.

11:16.027 --> 11:18.139
Who else have you slept with?

11:18.139 --> 11:20.365
Didn't Mitt ever want
to make you one of his wives?

11:20.405 --> 11:23.615
Okay, that you'll get letters for.

11:24.515 --> 11:26.602
Hold on just a second here.

11:26.602 --> 11:31.000
You're saying that man owns
that man's blood?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.241
Not exactly, your honor.

11:32.281 --> 11:35.270
–What is he, a vampire?
–Oh, we're in for an adventure.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.694
I heard that!

11:36.694 --> 11:39.798
My client got a patent
on Mr Griffin's blood, which—

11:39.838 --> 11:41.020
Is ridiculous.

11:41.020 --> 11:44.267
Under the law, once someone
removes blood or tissue from your body,

11:44.307 --> 11:46.409
you no longer have
legal ownership of it.

11:46.449 --> 11:49.283
So my client tested it,
got a patent—

11:49.283 --> 11:51.315
Now hold on just a second.

11:51.315 --> 11:55.129
You can't take his blood
without his consent,

11:55.129 --> 11:56.477
unless you're the government.

11:56.517 --> 11:58.622
If this blood is used
to find a cure for AIDS,

11:58.662 --> 12:01.011
my client should be entitled
to profit participation.

12:01.051 --> 12:04.144
And the cost of drug research
will be so exponentially multiplied,

12:04.184 --> 12:05.639
we won't develop cures for anything.

12:05.679 --> 12:08.104
Yes! And then we can all go to
the Academy awards

12:08.144 --> 12:11.403
and wear new ribbons that say,
“let's save big pharmaceutical.”

12:11.443 --> 12:13.487
Hold on just a second.

12:13.487 --> 12:16.709
Did this man win an Oscar?

12:17.059 --> 12:21.044
Judge, this is a very complicated case.

12:21.044 --> 12:24.211
He is using my client's
excised blood and tissue.

12:24.251 --> 12:27.072
Moreover, he's basically gotten
a patent on the DNA,

12:27.112 --> 12:30.921
which prevents my client from
ever marketing his own blood.

12:30.961 --> 12:33.239
I want to hear from
this vampire doctor.

12:33.279 --> 12:35.579
Get him up on the stand.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.444
How could you, of all people,
take this case?

12:46.484 --> 12:49.473
What's that supposed to mean,
I'm socially awkward?

12:49.513 --> 12:52.677
Or does it mean a lawyer should never take
a side he doesn't personally agree with?

12:52.717 --> 12:55.264
That would quite limit the field
of opportunity, wouldn't it?

12:55.304 --> 12:57.726
And for a socially awkward lawyer,

12:57.726 --> 12:59.730
well, he should grab any case
he can get, shouldn't he?

12:59.770 --> 13:01.381
I thought you were a nice person.

13:01.421 --> 13:03.293
I am.

13:04.203 --> 13:07.175
Look, my client doesn't want
this kind of publicity.

13:07.215 --> 13:11.170
Make me a reasonable offer,
and let's go home.

13:12.753 --> 13:15.076
$50 million.

13:27.871 --> 13:29.243
Denise?

13:30.444 --> 13:35.119
Thanks for the, uh, antitrust research.
It was very helpful.

13:35.119 --> 13:36.769
Good.

13:40.186 --> 13:46.162
I couldn't help but overhear
the deafening silence.

13:46.162 --> 13:48.861
Is everything all right
between you and Brad?

13:48.901 --> 13:51.317
He wants to get married
in full military uniform.

13:51.357 --> 13:56.403
He wants us to take our vows
with a sword at his side.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.765
Well, if it's important to him—

13:57.805 --> 14:03.075
Paul, my family is very anti-war.
The whole country—

14:03.075 --> 14:05.996
pro-war or not,
it's a very painful topic,

14:05.996 --> 14:10.986
and I don't want it to cast this huge
pall over my wedding ceremony.

14:10.986 --> 14:13.577
The country is not antimilitary.

14:13.577 --> 14:16.223
I know this. But…

14:16.223 --> 14:22.014
Look, I am proud of Brad
being a marine, Paul. I am.

14:22.014 --> 14:24.431
But I don't want a full
color guard at my wedding.

14:24.471 --> 14:26.579
I just, I don't.

14:36.147 --> 14:39.948
There are over 350 million tissue samples
from 180 million Americans

14:39.988 --> 14:42.048
stored in labs and hospitals
in this country.

14:42.088 --> 14:43.637
They've been used
to develop everything

14:43.677 --> 14:47.119
from the HIV test to vaccines,
cancer treatments.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.774
You don't have to get permission
from the patient to use their tissue?

14:49.814 --> 14:50.529
We do.

14:50.529 --> 14:53.463
It's part of the standardized form you sign
when you get medical treatment.

14:53.503 --> 14:55.089
He signed that form, by the way.

14:55.129 --> 14:57.487
Along with a zillion others
you jammed in front of my face.

14:57.527 --> 14:59.165
Sit down, you.

14:59.165 --> 15:05.544
Doctor, if Mr. Griffin is allowed to reclaim
the rights to his discarded blood and tissue

15:05.544 --> 15:07.747
and sell them to
a pharmaceutical company,

15:07.787 --> 15:08.811
what will happen?

15:08.851 --> 15:10.528
Well, I work under a federal grant,

15:10.568 --> 15:12.835
which means any fruits of my work
belong to the government.

15:12.875 --> 15:16.114
The cures we come up with will
belong to the public, as they should.

15:16.154 --> 15:18.289
You think this could lead to a cure?

15:18.329 --> 15:19.754
I don't know. It could.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.711
His blood sero-converted.

15:21.711 --> 15:24.807
The HIV vanished.
That's only happened once before.

15:24.847 --> 15:27.799
If we can find out how…

15:27.799 --> 15:28.900
imagine.

15:28.900 --> 15:32.371
Okay, but Mr Griffin wants to
let the research teams

15:32.371 --> 15:35.204
from the pharmaceutical
companies figure out how.

15:35.244 --> 15:37.674
If the pharmaceutical company
does the research,

15:37.714 --> 15:39.092
it'll be a trade secret,

15:39.132 --> 15:41.237
and they won't have to share
with anyone, and they won't,

15:41.277 --> 15:43.256
not till they get
all their patents in place,

15:43.296 --> 15:45.675
and they'll be able to charge
whatever they want.

15:45.715 --> 15:48.107
It won't be a nickel a pill.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.969
It's just not appropriate, Denny.

15:51.969 --> 15:54.319
To privately lust after a woman, fine,

15:54.359 --> 15:56.669
to send a signal
conveying as much, okay,

15:56.709 --> 16:00.468
but growling and clawing at her
crosses a line.

16:00.468 --> 16:01.586
But I love this woman.

16:01.626 --> 16:03.060
I thought you loved Bethany.

16:03.100 --> 16:06.465
Well, I love this one now.
I have a fickle heart.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.577
Well, you need to stay away from her.

16:08.617 --> 16:10.714
Why?
Give me one good reason.

16:10.714 --> 16:13.285
Okay. Dibs.

16:13.285 --> 16:15.642
But that's not fair.
I growled first.

16:15.682 --> 16:18.630
Hey! I have a prior relationship with her.

16:18.630 --> 16:20.458
Prior but not current.

16:20.458 --> 16:21.267
Well…

16:21.267 --> 16:23.598
Well, what?

16:23.892 --> 16:29.618
Maybe I'd like to keep current.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.548
You like this woman?

16:33.548 --> 16:35.928
Well…

16:36.899 --> 16:38.532
Yes.

16:47.098 --> 16:50.910
So did you tell Denise why wearing
the uniform is important to you?

16:50.950 --> 16:52.769
That's the whole point.
I shouldn't have to.

16:52.809 --> 16:54.618
The fact that I wanted to,
that should be enough.

16:54.658 --> 16:56.944
Well, that is not exactly
the way marriage works, Brad.

16:56.984 --> 16:59.569
You need to communicate.
–I did.

16:59.569 --> 17:01.209
I told her that I want to wear it.

17:01.249 --> 17:02.550
No, you need to tell her why.

17:02.590 --> 17:04.865
You need to communicate your feelings.

17:04.905 --> 17:07.342
Look, Paul, I'm not gonna get
all girlie, okay?

17:07.382 --> 17:09.150
Oh, dear God, Brad.

17:09.150 --> 17:11.969
If you cannot tell Denise
what and how you're feeling,

17:12.009 --> 17:15.446
you should not be getting married.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.117
The same thing supposedly
happened at DePaul university.

17:21.157 --> 17:24.598
The campus survey said the sisters of
ΓΚΤ were considered socially awkward.

17:24.637 --> 17:27.388
Apparently “misfit” wasn't the image
the sorority wanted to project.

17:27.429 --> 17:29.442
That is exactly what happened with us.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.907
You mentioned you pressured them
for a specific reason.

17:32.947 --> 17:35.573
Yes, they said we failed to
fulfill our recruitment duties,

17:35.613 --> 17:37.980
but nobody in our sorority ever did much
in the way of recruiting.

17:38.020 --> 17:40.312
What they meant by recruitment
was be pretty and popular,

17:40.352 --> 17:41.678
so that other girls would want to join.

17:41.718 --> 17:44.037
Objection. Speculation.
Foundation. Argumentative.

17:44.077 --> 17:46.769
Make up your mind, Jerry!

17:48.179 --> 17:50.807
The objection is overruled.

17:52.283 --> 17:54.360
Thank you, Marcie.

17:54.748 --> 17:57.441
I could be wrong, but when one goes
about trying to join a sorority,

17:57.481 --> 17:59.768
you basically hope the girls there
like you enough to invite

17:59.808 --> 18:01.910
you to be a member. Am I right?
–I suppose.

18:01.950 --> 18:05.707
Did you know what the specific criteria were
when you initially interviewed?

18:05.747 --> 18:07.188
No, I, I figured—

18:07.188 --> 18:08.917
They either liked you,
or they don't.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.710
–Right.
–And they did.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.582
Now they don't.

18:12.978 --> 18:15.506
They bounced me for being socially off!

18:15.546 --> 18:18.097
–Did anyone say that to you?
–I'm not stupid.

18:18.137 --> 18:20.581
After the campus survey,
they wanted to change their image, so—

18:20.621 --> 18:22.798
What was the image before you
initially interviewed, if you know?

18:22.838 --> 18:25.748
–Well—
–That this was a place for the socially off?

18:25.788 --> 18:26.501
No.

18:26.501 --> 18:27.909
So when you said “change their image,”

18:27.949 --> 18:30.295
did you really mean to say
“conform with their image”?

18:30.335 --> 18:31.688
I'm confused.
–Sit down.

18:31.728 --> 18:33.091
Objection!

18:33.091 --> 18:34.949
You're objecting to your own question?

18:34.989 --> 18:39.299
He just told me to sit down
in a menacing tone.

18:39.299 --> 18:41.721
–I didn't hear anything.
–Oh, my.

18:41.721 --> 18:46.424
If you hear voices, they'd never
let you into ΓΚΤ.

18:53.972 --> 18:57.340
Sorry.
I have a funny laugh.

18:57.815 --> 19:00.035
They didn't like that either.

19:02.956 --> 19:05.463
–Drop the charges?
–Yes.

19:05.463 --> 19:09.023
She had a 20-ounce bag of
hallucinogens in her chambers.

19:09.063 --> 19:10.424
It was tea.

19:10.424 --> 19:13.499
Not to mention, there's
no real proof it was hers.

19:13.539 --> 19:15.501
–I have the confession of the clerk.
–That's it?

19:15.541 --> 19:19.457
The linchpin of your case is the naked,
hallucinating dancing man

19:19.497 --> 19:22.738
who will say just about anything
to temper his embarrassment,

19:22.778 --> 19:25.679
let alone criminal charges.

19:25.679 --> 19:27.178
Are you really gonna challenge this?

19:27.218 --> 19:30.464
Look, you've had many cases
before judge Weldon.

19:30.464 --> 19:32.918
She's a fair and talented jurist.

19:32.918 --> 19:35.860
In fact, you've won many cases
before judge Weldon,

19:35.900 --> 19:38.085
as you've amassed
your impressive record,

19:38.125 --> 19:42.572
which, as I see it, is about one high-profile
conviction away from political advancement.

19:42.612 --> 19:43.514
Not about that.

19:43.554 --> 19:45.253
Well, here's what it could be about,

19:45.293 --> 19:47.942
and please stop me if you've
already considered this

19:47.982 --> 19:50.582
and said, “hell, it's only my career.”

19:50.582 --> 19:52.605
A judge with a criminal conviction,

19:52.645 --> 19:56.834
one for using hallucinogens no less,
presents all kinds of problems.

19:56.874 --> 19:58.285
One might have to wonder,

19:58.325 --> 20:02.689
was she on the whoopee tea
while presiding over previous cases?

20:02.689 --> 20:06.184
Imagine all the felons sitting in jail

20:06.184 --> 20:09.941
salivating at the chance
to overturn their convictions.

20:09.941 --> 20:12.286
Quite of few of your convictions, maybe.

20:12.326 --> 20:15.662
So much for the impressive record.

20:15.662 --> 20:20.758
But I am a little concerned
about your boss.

20:20.758 --> 20:25.178
You do know he and the judge
used to be romantically entwined?

20:25.178 --> 20:27.440
But who really worries about that,

20:27.440 --> 20:32.202
given your larger concern of alienating
all those other state court judges,

20:32.242 --> 20:35.239
who tend to get
constipated and vengeful

20:35.239 --> 20:37.326
whenever one of their own
is targeted?

20:37.366 --> 20:40.655
What needs to come
first here is principle,

20:40.655 --> 20:43.680
certainly not political pragmatism.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.508
If that were in play, we never
would have gotten this far,

20:46.548 --> 20:48.045
would we?

20:52.419 --> 20:54.197
First of all,
I signed a stack of papers.

20:54.237 --> 20:56.099
I didn't read any of them.
–Why not?

20:56.139 --> 20:57.163
Does anybody?

20:57.163 --> 20:59.167
Doctors say, “sign here
or we won't treat you.”

20:59.207 --> 21:00.456
That isn't duress?

21:00.456 --> 21:03.558
Plus, I had just gotten news
I was HIV positive.

21:03.598 --> 21:05.223
I was in total shock.

21:05.223 --> 21:08.919
And if you maintained ownership
of your discarded blood and tissue,

21:08.959 --> 21:09.942
what would you do with it?

21:09.982 --> 21:11.507
I would sell it to
a pharmaceutical company

21:11.547 --> 21:14.362
which would likely increase
the chances of discovering a cure.

21:14.402 --> 21:18.014
Private enterprise vs the government?
It's not even close.

21:18.054 --> 21:20.175
Look how the government
has spent our money.

21:20.215 --> 21:24.514
Did you take time out
to be grateful for this cure?

21:24.514 --> 21:27.435
Or did you immediately
phone your accountant?

21:27.475 --> 21:29.986
When was the last time
you had a deadly disease?

21:30.026 --> 21:31.138
I didn't.

21:31.138 --> 21:32.489
And I count my blessings.

21:32.529 --> 21:35.662
Just wonder if you count yours.

21:35.662 --> 21:39.271
If I strike you as having
a psychological deficit or two,

21:39.311 --> 21:42.355
if I come off as being
a little bitter—

21:42.355 --> 21:43.508
You're bitter?

21:43.508 --> 21:45.720
You just dodged a death sentence.
Maybe it's me,

21:45.760 --> 21:48.674
but I'd think your heart might be
instilled by some sense of charity.

21:48.714 --> 21:50.304
–Charity?
–Simon.

21:50.304 --> 21:52.997
Let me tell you something.
For 2 years, I was shunned,

21:53.037 --> 21:55.869
discriminated against,
made to feel like a leper.

21:55.909 --> 22:00.718
–Simon. –Do you have any idea
how society treats people with HIV?

22:00.718 --> 22:04.946
It's not charitable,
and if you're expecting me to—

22:23.211 --> 22:28.623
Clarence, how's your trial
with Jerry going?

22:29.419 --> 22:31.192
He's mean.

22:31.499 --> 22:33.120
I'm sorry?

22:34.461 --> 22:38.117
Jerry Espenson.
He's not a nice person.

22:38.117 --> 22:42.978
Maybe he's just acting how
he thinks lawyers should act, but…

22:42.978 --> 22:44.701
it's mean.

22:45.185 --> 22:46.767
Oh.

22:48.942 --> 22:51.594
Clevant spoke today…

22:51.861 --> 22:53.763
in court.

22:55.588 --> 23:00.471
I didn't mean to really
speak as him. I just…

23:00.471 --> 23:01.979
did.

23:01.979 --> 23:04.682
I can be tougher as him.

23:08.441 --> 23:10.390
I have to cross
the sorority woman tomorrow.

23:10.430 --> 23:13.827
I think I'll do better as Clevant.

23:14.460 --> 23:17.614
Clarence, I'm not gonna
tell you what to do,

23:17.614 --> 23:20.103
but if you start
speaking as Clevant,

23:20.103 --> 23:23.399
you could lose credibility
with the judge.

23:23.399 --> 23:28.215
That won't serve your client.

23:28.215 --> 23:33.850
I'm not sure “I” can cross this woman.

23:33.850 --> 23:36.060
I think you can.

23:38.182 --> 23:40.120
Clarence…

23:41.764 --> 23:44.031
I think you can.

24:07.976 --> 24:09.331
Sororities are like any club.

24:09.371 --> 24:11.768
You choose people you
want for members.

24:11.808 --> 24:13.842
Some of these people,
like Ms Cooper,

24:13.882 --> 24:16.360
had been chosen
and were then disinvited.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.929
And like any club, sometimes
you choose the wrong members.

24:19.969 --> 24:22.709
This goes on in country clubs,
bridge clubs.

24:22.749 --> 24:26.128
Look, if they're social in nature,
which sororities are,

24:26.168 --> 24:28.265
their social skills come into play.

24:28.305 --> 24:33.799
So you're admitting their social awkwardness
was the cause for their discharge?

24:33.799 --> 24:35.811
–It was a factor.
–Bad for the image.

24:35.851 --> 24:37.485
In so many words.

24:37.485 --> 24:40.335
And before you all wave your arms
in dismay, let me tell you,

24:40.375 --> 24:43.854
every fraternity, every sorority
works exactly the same way.

24:43.894 --> 24:47.112
You populate the franchise
with kids who socialize well together.

24:47.152 --> 24:51.164
In success, it becomes a place
where incoming freshmen want to join.

24:51.204 --> 24:53.528
They all trade on image.

24:53.528 --> 24:56.756
And your image is beautiful people?

24:56.756 --> 24:59.950
Attractive is perhaps
a nicer image than unattractive.

24:59.990 --> 25:01.970
But mainly, the image is social.

25:02.010 --> 25:04.536
Antisocial people
don't best accomplish that.

25:04.576 --> 25:07.835
You didn't get rid of my client
for being antisocial.

25:07.875 --> 25:10.060
It's because she was socially awkward.

25:10.100 --> 25:13.664
Look, I didn't make that decision
personally, so I can't be sure,

25:13.704 --> 25:16.366
but if somebody is standing
at a party not talking to anybody,

25:16.406 --> 25:21.742
the distinction between socially awkward
and antisocial is a tough one to draw.

25:21.742 --> 25:23.031
And looks?

25:23.031 --> 25:25.730
You like your sorority sisters
to be pretty.

25:25.770 --> 25:27.719
That's not necessarily a criterion.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.505
I think if you were to do an analysis,

25:29.545 --> 25:33.855
you'd probably discover good-looking
people tend to be more socially outgoing.

25:33.895 --> 25:35.479
What about values?

25:35.479 --> 25:37.834
Of course we want
people of good values.

25:37.874 --> 25:40.382
You consider it good values

25:40.382 --> 25:43.386
to throw somebody out of
your club because she's shy?

25:43.426 --> 25:46.930
As I said, the main point
of the club is social,

25:46.930 --> 25:48.413
fun to be around.

25:48.413 --> 25:51.684
If a member suddenly suffered
from depression,

25:51.684 --> 25:53.844
out she goes?

25:54.708 --> 25:55.644
That isn't fair.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.947
Well, if she were no longer
fun to be around—

25:57.987 --> 26:02.000
Objection. He's totally
twisting her words, your honor.

26:04.590 --> 26:08.607
Would you ever take somebody
with Asperger's?

26:08.607 --> 26:09.335
Objection!

26:09.335 --> 26:13.366
If they made funny sounds and walked
around with their hands on their thighs?

26:13.406 --> 26:15.718
–Cheap shot, cheap shot!
–I was just asking what—

26:15.758 --> 26:17.453
You made it personal against me!

26:17.493 --> 26:18.312
No, no, I was—

26:18.352 --> 26:20.496
Yes, you did, you, you…

26:20.496 --> 26:22.787
you fat boy!

26:22.787 --> 26:23.861
What did you call me?

26:23.901 --> 26:26.681
You attack me,
I'll attack you right back.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.834
I won't be attacked.
I won't be offended.

26:28.874 --> 26:30.507
I won't be picked on like that.
Do you hear me?

26:30.547 --> 26:32.704
Now you look here, you—

26:34.804 --> 26:37.578
I will try my case.
You try yours.

26:37.578 --> 26:40.385
Yeah, well, here's the thing
about that, pal.

26:40.425 --> 26:43.304
Once I get done with you, I—

26:49.192 --> 26:51.916
Don't forget your little hop, bro!

27:02.681 --> 27:04.249
I'm supposed to meet Alan.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.872
He asked me to take over.

27:05.912 --> 27:07.439
Did he ask you to take my hand?

27:07.479 --> 27:13.052
Gloria, I know a fantastic
little rehab, very romantic.

27:13.052 --> 27:15.744
And if the hallucinogens
don't get you in,

27:15.784 --> 27:19.221
I know some wonderful ethnic slurs.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.690
Do you think it's right
to be hitting on me?

27:21.730 --> 27:23.109
It feels right.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.263
–And what would Alan think?
–Alan who?

27:25.303 --> 27:28.939
Greenspan, a man considerably
sexier than you.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.142
I knew you were there.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.249
I need to talk to my client,
Denny. Get out.

27:32.289 --> 27:33.735
Your client is my client.

27:33.775 --> 27:35.321
Please get out.

27:38.851 --> 27:40.619
You upset with me?

27:41.971 --> 27:43.617
Alan, sometimes the mad cow just—

27:43.657 --> 27:45.304
Out.

27:55.649 --> 27:58.947
The plaintiff wants to make this
case about, did Simon Griffin,

27:58.987 --> 28:01.659
who has a graduate degree,
know what he was signing

28:01.699 --> 28:05.365
when he allowed Dr Freemont
to use his blood in medical research?

28:05.405 --> 28:07.794
Let me tell you what this
should really be about.

28:07.834 --> 28:12.094
3 numbers. 40, 4 and 3,

28:12.094 --> 28:13.739
like a locker combination.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.366
40 million people
have AIDS worldwide.

28:16.366 --> 28:19.953
4 million were newly diagnosed
last year alone,

28:19.953 --> 28:21.713
and 3 million died.

28:21.713 --> 28:24.632
Simon Griffin's blood has the potential

28:24.632 --> 28:29.556
to make that locker combination
zero, zero and zero.

28:29.556 --> 28:32.568
Now we don't often get the chance
to make someone do the right thing.

28:32.608 --> 28:34.600
Most of the time people
do the wrong thing,

28:34.640 --> 28:39.270
like pharmaceutical companies
charging $15,000 a year for AIDS medication

28:39.310 --> 28:41.819
it costs them $350 to make.

28:41.819 --> 28:43.493
India brought them to task for that,

28:43.533 --> 28:46.576
and now it's sold there at cost.

28:46.576 --> 28:48.491
This is AIDS, your honor.

28:48.491 --> 28:51.053
And the world is
standing up and saying,

28:51.093 --> 28:57.627
“you don't get to make your fortune off
the impending deaths of 40 million people.”

28:57.627 --> 29:00.305
Taking something from someone
else for the greater good,

29:00.345 --> 29:03.051
we have a name for that.
It's called eminent domain.

29:03.091 --> 29:07.109
If you have a property, a home
that's in the way of a planned freeway,

29:07.149 --> 29:10.057
the government can just
come right in and take it.

29:10.097 --> 29:12.818
If we can do that to facilitate traffic,

29:12.818 --> 29:15.331
then why don't we do it to cure AIDS?

29:15.331 --> 29:17.099
Why don't we just say,

29:17.099 --> 29:21.285
“too bad, Simon, but the laws
that protect everybody else

29:21.285 --> 29:23.279
”don't protect you because…

29:23.279 --> 29:26.690
”well, you have something
that we really, really want,

29:26.730 --> 29:30.056
”so we're just going to
come in and take it.”

29:30.056 --> 29:33.915
Does anyone here remember the flu vaccine
crisis a couple of years ago?

29:33.955 --> 29:36.016
That was the government's baby.

29:36.016 --> 29:39.060
The flu kills 36,000 Americans a year.

29:39.060 --> 29:43.739
And yet, the government left
30 million without vaccinations.

29:43.739 --> 29:45.157
Oops.

29:45.293 --> 29:48.441
So even if you don't like
Simon Griffin, you may think—

29:48.481 --> 29:50.220
He's an ass.

29:50.220 --> 29:52.323
Yes, he is.

29:52.323 --> 29:55.992
And if you were in his position,
maybe you would be totally selfless,

29:56.032 --> 29:59.225
but Simon Griffin isn't saying
no one can test him

29:59.265 --> 30:03.806
He's just saying
he wants to choose who does it.

30:04.356 --> 30:07.354
And he doesn't want to
choose the same bunch

30:07.354 --> 30:09.907
that was in charge of the flu.

30:14.999 --> 30:19.920
I imagine in a moment of
calm reflection or sound judgment,

30:19.920 --> 30:24.308
the district attorney simply saw
his way to dropping the charges.

30:24.308 --> 30:26.587
Oh, thank God.

30:26.587 --> 30:28.545
Let's leave God out of it.

30:28.545 --> 30:31.072
You can thank me, Gloria.

30:32.689 --> 30:34.309
How about…

30:34.309 --> 30:37.477
I invite you over for a cup of tea?

30:37.477 --> 30:40.078
I'm not a great fan of hallucinogens.

30:40.078 --> 30:44.424
That commercial with the frying egg
had a profound effect on me.

30:49.352 --> 30:51.080
So, well…

30:52.722 --> 30:55.294
what would you like me to do?

30:58.760 --> 31:01.748
Would you like me
to do it right here?

31:02.772 --> 31:05.649
I would like you
to have dinner with me.

31:06.524 --> 31:09.179
And if it goes well,
perhaps another one.

31:09.219 --> 31:12.066
And if that one goes well,
maybe a third,

31:12.066 --> 31:17.868
after which I might kiss you
at your front door.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.510
You want to…

31:21.510 --> 31:22.928
Date.

31:23.946 --> 31:28.534
I'd like to go out with you.

31:33.638 --> 31:37.874
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
just rip my clothes off?

31:42.010 --> 31:43.801
Positive.

31:45.581 --> 31:50.172
Could I at least give you
an advance on that third date?

31:50.482 --> 31:52.435
Well, if you must.

32:09.152 --> 32:11.413
I guess Denny didn't like it.

32:24.111 --> 32:26.526
Mr Bell, we'll hear from you.

32:40.787 --> 32:45.679
College is a place
where we teach our children,

32:45.679 --> 32:47.877
believing they are our future.

32:47.877 --> 32:52.181
Do we really want a future
of social intolerance,

32:52.181 --> 32:55.637
where people are ostracized
for being shy,

32:55.637 --> 32:59.809
where the beautiful
and the popular are celebrated,

32:59.809 --> 33:04.825
and the less attractive
and the awkward are scorned?

33:04.825 --> 33:10.332
ΓΚΤ is a national club promoting
a message that is as intolerant

33:10.332 --> 33:12.464
as it should be unacceptable.

33:12.464 --> 33:16.566
I suppose it's one thing if they never
wanted to invite Marcie Cooper in.

33:16.606 --> 33:19.630
But having invited her,

33:19.630 --> 33:24.862
to throw her out on grounds
of social unfitness,

33:26.135 --> 33:28.381
shame on them.

33:47.202 --> 33:50.701
College is also about preparing
students for the outside world.

33:50.741 --> 33:53.774
Last time I checked,
it's pretty tough out there.

33:53.814 --> 33:57.674
There's the old adage,
“nice guys finish last.”

33:57.674 --> 34:00.028
There's some truth to that.

34:00.831 --> 34:06.094
I happen to know opposing counsel
is a fundamentally kind man,

34:06.094 --> 34:08.206
sensitive.

34:08.723 --> 34:13.275
He chose to exploit my Asperger's
syndrome to win this case.

34:13.275 --> 34:14.755
My very best friend,

34:14.755 --> 34:17.371
a lawyer that I had a case
against not too long ago,

34:17.411 --> 34:20.232
he, too, exploited my Asperger's.

34:20.232 --> 34:28.492
He's a very good man who
opted for cruelty as a strategy.

34:32.516 --> 34:37.902
If Marcie Cooper comes out of this experience
thinking that people can be cruel,

34:37.902 --> 34:40.815
even the kind, sensitive ones,

34:40.815 --> 34:44.329
if she's learned that she will
be judged not simply on merit

34:44.369 --> 34:46.882
or the content of her character,

34:46.882 --> 34:51.154
but on how she looks
and socializes with others,

34:51.154 --> 34:53.318
she's gotten an education,

34:53.318 --> 34:56.652
one that will serve her in life.

34:57.433 --> 35:00.611
This is a free society.
People get to choose their friends.

35:00.651 --> 35:02.545
Clubs get to choose their members.

35:02.585 --> 35:06.324
Sometimes it's very ugly and unfair.

35:07.571 --> 35:11.377
That's… life!

35:39.426 --> 35:41.814
–Hey.
–Hey.

35:51.885 --> 35:55.170
My dad served in Vietnam.

35:55.170 --> 35:58.608
He put his life on the line.

35:59.044 --> 36:01.417
But instead of coming home
to a hero's welcome,

36:01.457 --> 36:05.802
he found a country that was
either ashamed of the war

36:05.802 --> 36:08.585
or just wanted to deny it,

36:08.585 --> 36:10.108
deny him.

36:10.108 --> 36:15.689
And I fear that our soldiers in Iraq
could face the same thing.

36:16.490 --> 36:20.342
And we seem to be in such a hurry
for this thing to be over with,

36:20.382 --> 36:23.621
so we can go back to pretending…

36:25.632 --> 36:31.459
see, in Vietnam,
soldiers didn't survive.

36:32.676 --> 36:35.345
But today they do.

36:35.345 --> 36:41.386
And they come home
missing legs and arms and eyes…

36:41.386 --> 36:44.461
you know, and not much to cling to.

36:48.049 --> 36:50.986
They need us to be proud of them.

36:51.204 --> 36:54.029
You know, they need us to show it.

36:57.138 --> 36:59.537
Every chance we get.

37:14.782 --> 37:16.562
Truth be told,

37:16.562 --> 37:22.244
I couldn't understand what the hell
anybody was talking about in this case.

37:22.244 --> 37:24.919
It was clear to me that Mr Griffin,

37:24.919 --> 37:27.472
as I said, was an ass.

37:27.472 --> 37:33.283
The idea of one person getting a patent
on somebody else's DNA,

37:33.283 --> 37:41.113
well, you don't have to be a senile
old goat to be befuddled by that.

37:41.490 --> 37:47.248
But the most confusing thing
of all is the idea

37:47.248 --> 37:50.783
that AIDS maybe can be cured

37:50.783 --> 37:55.277
and progress is repeatedly being stalled

37:55.277 --> 38:02.749
by a bunch of drug companies and scientists
going for patents and fighting over profits.

38:02.749 --> 38:06.271
I don't doubt the sincerity of the doctor.

38:06.271 --> 38:09.611
Legally, I suppose,
he does have a patent,

38:09.611 --> 38:16.389
but I keep coming back to,
this is Simon Griffin's blood,

38:16.389 --> 38:18.705
and he's an ass.

38:18.705 --> 38:22.397
I rule in favor of the doctor.

38:22.397 --> 38:24.116
Adjourned.

38:30.028 --> 38:31.342
What the—

38:31.342 --> 38:32.496
what just happened?

38:32.536 --> 38:34.780
He played the ass card.

38:44.837 --> 38:46.625
Has the jury reached a verdict?

38:46.665 --> 38:48.137
We have, your honor.

38:48.578 --> 38:51.957
In the matter of
Marcie Cooper vs ΓΚΤ sorority,

38:51.957 --> 38:54.993
we the jury find in favor
of the defendant.

38:54.993 --> 38:57.717
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
thank you for your service.

38:57.757 --> 38:59.447
You're dismissed.

39:00.144 --> 39:01.714
I'm sorry.

39:03.156 --> 39:06.454
Well, you tried.

39:06.454 --> 39:08.573
You fought, Marcie.
That's what's important.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.117
You didn't sit back and take it.

39:10.157 --> 39:11.410
Yeah.

39:12.429 --> 39:15.656
I sure could have used
that $50 million, though.

39:40.953 --> 39:42.460
So…

39:42.749 --> 39:46.399
Hands beat Clarence?

39:47.406 --> 39:49.442
Were they any good?

39:50.578 --> 39:52.516
They were both excellent.

39:52.516 --> 39:55.430
Tough, shrewd, mercenary,

39:55.430 --> 39:57.553
all the ideals we aspire to.

39:57.553 --> 40:00.000
It saddened me beyond belief.

40:00.339 --> 40:02.573
Well, look on the bright side.

40:02.881 --> 40:05.504
Judge Gloria Weldon.

40:09.213 --> 40:11.715
You know, Denny, I didn't
appreciate you hitting on her

40:11.755 --> 40:15.593
after I specifically told you
I was interested in her.

40:17.293 --> 40:19.417
Alan, I wouldn't move in on your girl.

40:19.457 --> 40:22.585
I was just trying to get there first
to make her my girl.

40:22.625 --> 40:24.342
Well, she is my girl.

40:24.342 --> 40:25.782
Got it?

40:27.708 --> 40:29.489
You went after Shirley
when I told you not to.

40:29.529 --> 40:33.555
Fine. I'll stay away from Shirley.
You keep away from Gloria.

40:37.454 --> 40:39.606
You like this woman?

40:40.867 --> 40:42.748
Do you love her?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.056
Denny, I haven't even
had a date with her.

40:46.096 --> 40:50.320
But you think you could love her.
That's what this is all about.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.228
It's been so long
since I let myself love a woman,

40:53.268 --> 40:55.458
I wouldn't even know.

40:55.700 --> 40:57.934
It's…

40:57.934 --> 41:00.039
terrifying.

41:00.424 --> 41:02.301
But that's the best part,

41:02.301 --> 41:04.867
being on the high wire.

41:04.867 --> 41:07.380
It's good to be in love, Alan.

41:07.380 --> 41:09.813
You aren't just saying that?

41:10.866 --> 41:13.101
It's everything.

41:14.538 --> 41:17.369
Just don't let her
cut into our special time.

41:17.409 --> 41:18.238
I would never.

41:18.278 --> 41:20.155
'Cause that's what they like
to do, women, you know?

41:20.195 --> 41:22.494
First thing, just cut you off
from your friends.

41:22.534 --> 41:23.453
Not gonna happen.

41:23.493 --> 41:25.681
You tell her right from the start,
I come first.

41:25.721 --> 41:27.491
–Done.
–If I need a sleepover…

41:27.531 --> 41:29.586
You get priority.

41:30.034 --> 41:31.344
Promise?

41:31.344 --> 41:32.903
Promise.

41:36.620 --> 41:39.005
She's a beautiful woman, Alan.

41:41.691 --> 41:43.560
Yes, she is.
