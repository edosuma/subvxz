- Yeah, everything--

04:57.384 --> 04:59.168
everything was better.

- So you were at "The
Messenger" for the last year?

05:07.350 --> 05:09.613

my first story published.

05:09.657 --> 05:11.702

- Lois, you didn't even
talk to him.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.404
- I didn't need to.
We need somebody who cares more

06:01.448 --> 06:03.275
about the job than about
how many twits follow them.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.668
Also, that article he wrote

06:04.712 --> 06:07.018

- You haven't liked
a single person I've brought

06:08.585 --> 06:10.500

- That is correct because

06:10.544 --> 06:12.459
none of them were good enough.
- They were the best available.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.939
Look, we're gonna have
to compromise on something,

06:14.983 --> 06:17.289

another reporter in here

Daniel's face on it.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.970
He'd make a super hot mayor.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.972
- No, it doesn't matter
what he looks like, Sarah.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.800
He just needs to beat
George Dean

06:49.844 --> 06:51.759

as hard as possible

- Um, it's, um--

13:35.902 --> 13:37.425
- You know what?
I don't even wanna hear

13:37.468 --> 13:39.949
whatever lame excuse
your brain is concocting.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.777
Get dressed
and meet me downstairs.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.693
We are going to have a serious
conversation immediately!

13:44.736 --> 13:46.260
- Yes, ma'am.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.091
<i>- I'm aware of</i> <i>
the implications.</i>

13:51.134 --> 13:52.875
Just let me talk to him.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.051
I'm sure I'll get this
whole thing straightened out.

13:57.401 --> 14:00.709
Yes, he's just arrived.

14:00.752 --> 14:01.797
Yes, sir.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.148
- This about the sub?

14:05.192 --> 14:06.584
- It's not really playing well

14:06.628 --> 14:07.934
around these parts.

14:07.977 --> 14:08.935
- I was just trying
to save lives.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.372
- Sure, I get it. I do.

14:11.415 --> 14:14.418
The problem is you rescued
a North Korean submarine,

14:14.462 --> 14:15.593
a nuclear one,

14:15.637 --> 14:17.378
and then
you returned it to them.

14:17.421 --> 14:20.337
Couldn't you have just
dropped it by American soil?

14:20.381 --> 14:21.773
- It's important that
I stay out of the--

14:21.817 --> 14:23.558
- Geopolitics of it all.

14:23.601 --> 14:27.562
It's just that we seem
to keep having these issues...

14:27.605 --> 14:30.347
communicating with each other.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.436
The whole reason
that I got this position

14:32.480 --> 14:35.962
is because I was the one
who knew everything about you--

14:36.005 --> 14:38.442
all your saves,
all your history.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.792
Now it's feeling clear to me
that actually,

14:40.836 --> 14:42.969
I know nothing about you.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.493
- Lieutenant Anderson,
that's not true.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.670
Maybe a little true.

14:48.713 --> 14:51.542
- Look, we don't need to be
best friends, okay?

14:51.586 --> 14:55.024
But we do need to be up-front
with each other

14:55.068 --> 14:57.070
just like you
and General Lane were.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.462
- It wasn't that simple.
- Doesn't matter.

14:58.506 --> 14:59.724
That's how
the upper brass see it.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.639
- They're not my concern.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.946
- Sure, not yet.

15:05.556 --> 15:08.298
But if I can't
get your firm commitment

15:08.342 --> 15:11.780
that American interests
come first,

15:11.823 --> 15:13.738
our working relationship's
gonna have to change.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.262
- Lieutenant,
we've been over this.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.394
I will continue
to do everything I can

15:17.438 --> 15:19.353
to help the DOD.
- That's not a commitment.

15:19.396 --> 15:23.009
- It's the best I can do.

15:23.052 --> 15:25.576
<i>- Clark, I need you home now.</i>

15:25.620 --> 15:26.926
I have to go.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.841
- Wait, what's so impor--

15:29.885 --> 15:31.104
Important now?

15:36.587 --> 15:38.546
- Is everything okay?

15:39.721 --> 15:41.592
Where's Candice?
- You knew she was here?

15:41.636 --> 15:43.638
- Yeah, I dropped them both off
after practice.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.161
What happened?

15:45.205 --> 15:47.033
- Go up to your room.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.338
- Happily.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.953
- What happened is that
I came home to find

15:53.996 --> 15:56.694
our not-even-old-enough
- to-drive son

15:56.738 --> 15:59.436
in bed half-naked with Candice.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.875
- Jonathan, come on, man.
What are you thinking?

16:03.919 --> 16:07.314
- He's 15 years old and home
alone with his new girlfriend.

16:07.357 --> 16:08.968
It's pretty obvious
what he was thinking.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.448
- What? You mean--no, th--

16:11.492 --> 16:13.102
I never would've done that
when I was his age.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.104
- Well, then he clearly
takes after his mother.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.194
Do you want me to go up
and talk to him?

16:18.238 --> 16:19.891
- No, he's just gonna give you
some bogus answer.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.806
By the way, who knows what
Jordan's up to right now.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.547
- Oh, Lois, come on.
- What?

16:23.591 --> 16:25.375
He certainly didn't wanna tell
us anything this morning.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.682
- He did tell us. He said
he had a surprise for Sarah.

16:27.725 --> 16:30.076
- Well, if he can get away
with that non-answer,

16:30.119 --> 16:32.121
then don't be surprised
when we're grandparents

16:32.165 --> 16:34.080
nine months from now.
- Wow.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.385
- Clark, you really
don't get it, do you?

16:35.429 --> 16:38.040
- No. No, I guess I don't.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.911
But I'm trying to.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.175
- Don't do this right now.
- Lois, would you please

16:42.218 --> 16:44.046
just tell me
what's bothering you?

16:44.090 --> 16:45.482
- Is it the Natalie thing?
Is it--

16:45.526 --> 16:48.224
- No!
This is what is bothering me!

16:48.268 --> 16:50.618
That you left
our 15-year-old son

16:50.661 --> 16:52.185
home alone to have sex.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.056
- You're acting like
I did something wrong.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.711
- And you're acting like
this isn't a big deal.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.234
- Not enough to use
the ELT, no.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.062
- Okay, so now
you're just criticizing me.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.933
- That is for real
emergencies, Lois,

17:01.977 --> 17:05.024
not to get me home to talk
about some high school hook-up.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.157
- You know what? Why don't you
go to Lana's without me?

17:10.420 --> 17:11.465
- Fine.

17:11.508 --> 17:12.770
- Fine!

17:19.255 --> 17:21.431
- Are you ready now?

17:21.475 --> 17:25.870
- Almost, just gimme a sec.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.568
- I mean, not to cramp
your style or anything

17:27.611 --> 17:30.266
but this blindfold's
really itchy, so...

17:32.442 --> 17:33.617
- Here.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.536
- Oh, wow.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.495
How'd you light all those?

17:41.538 --> 17:43.410
- A magician never reveals
his secret.

17:43.453 --> 17:46.456
- Yeah, I'd believe that
if you were a magician.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.328
- I just wanted to do something
nice for you coming back.

17:48.371 --> 17:53.985
<i>♪</i>

17:54.029 --> 17:55.248
- Um...

17:55.291 --> 17:57.641
- Is--is everything all right?

17:57.685 --> 18:02.211
- Yeah, it's just,
we got arrested here and I'm--

18:02.255 --> 18:04.300
I'm feeling sort of crampy.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.128
- Oh, uh,

18:06.172 --> 18:07.912
I--I didn't know.
- Of course you didn't.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.915
I mean, it's not really
something I text you about.

18:14.702 --> 18:18.532
- Well, uh, you wanna go home?

18:19.924 --> 18:21.274
- I'm sorry.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.797
I mean, maybe
we could try it again

18:22.840 --> 18:25.060
when I'm not feeling
really crappy and weird.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.148
- Yeah, okay.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.671
- Okay.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.764
<i>- And here is a T-shirt.</i> <i>
- Thanks.</i>

18:33.808 --> 18:36.245
- Yes, here is a T-shirt.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.204
There's some people I want you
to meet in the living room.

18:38.247 --> 18:41.032
- Okay.
- Great.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.556
- Mr. Hart, what are your plans

18:42.599 --> 18:44.514
for the settlement money
from Galaxy Holdings?

18:44.558 --> 18:45.994
- Simple.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.778
To give back and build better.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.519
We're talking local
infrastructure,

18:49.563 --> 18:51.956
community services, building
a new park for the kids.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.567
- That's just what we need.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.656
- Thank you.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.353
- You see all this
jibber jabber

18:57.397 --> 18:59.660
about infrastructure and parks

18:59.703 --> 19:01.227
and I still haven't
heard anything about

19:01.270 --> 19:03.272
giving our kids' teachers
a raise.

19:03.316 --> 19:06.449
It's been what, five years?
- At least five years.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.886
- It's been five years since
our teachers have had a raise.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.150
What are do you planning
to do about that?

19:11.193 --> 19:14.805
- Well, I--well,
I can certainly look into that.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.025
- Oh.

19:17.068 --> 19:20.681
- What Daniel means
is that he is pro schools.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.596
And if that means
giving the teachers

19:22.639 --> 19:24.250
the raises they deserve,

19:24.293 --> 19:26.382
then this administration
will see that it gets done.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.170
- That's what
I'm talking about.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.215
Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.782
- And as you can see,
I've already got

19:34.825 --> 19:36.653
the best people working for me.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.133
- Would you mind getting me
some more of

19:38.177 --> 19:39.526
that shrimp cocktail?
It's delicious.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.049
- Daniel Hart,
ladies and gentlemen,

19:41.092 --> 19:43.486
Hey, meet a friend of ours,
Daniel Hart.

19:43.530 --> 19:44.705
Friend, come on now.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.709
- Hey.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.450
Sorry I'm late.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.234
- No man, it's--it's all good.

19:52.278 --> 19:55.324
Frankly,
you're not missing much.

19:55.368 --> 19:56.847
Where's Lois?

19:56.891 --> 19:59.241
- Uh, work.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.808
- Wow, you're a terrible
damn liar.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.375
You know that?
-

20:02.418 --> 20:05.465
- Y'all aren't in a fight
or something, are you?

20:05.508 --> 20:07.771
- Yeah.
- Oh, damn, man.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.947
I'm--I'm sorry.
I--I just thought

20:09.991 --> 20:12.123
y'all were the couple
that never argued, you know?

20:12.167 --> 20:14.169
- No, it's just--

20:14.213 --> 20:15.475
I just--feels like
there's something

20:15.518 --> 20:17.955
Lois isn't telling me, but--

20:17.999 --> 20:19.392
- Listen, you want some advice?

20:19.435 --> 20:21.785
Best let sleeping dogs lie.

20:21.829 --> 20:25.006
- Really?
- See, women are...

20:25.049 --> 20:27.138
mysterious creatures, Kent.

20:27.182 --> 20:30.272
A lot of times
where there's mystery there's--

20:30.316 --> 20:32.100
there's danger.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.974
- I hear Lana and Daniel are
working pretty well together.

20:37.018 --> 20:40.282
- Yeah, couple of damn
peas in a pod.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.979
Listen, if you'll excuse me,

20:42.023 --> 20:46.506
I got some sloppy-ass
shrimp cocktails to deliver.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.262
- Maybe she went to
the Met Museum after school.

21:03.305 --> 21:06.265
- I'm afraid the museum
is still under repair

21:06.308 --> 21:07.788
from the Battle of Metropolis.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.225
- Where could she be?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.661
Natalie.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.754
Nat. Nat.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.626
Where have you been?
- Just went for a walk.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.018
- School ended 3 hours ago.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.411
- Well, I left
before first period.

21:22.455 --> 21:25.196
- Wait, did something happen?

21:25.240 --> 21:26.676
- I mean, Annika looked
right through me

21:26.720 --> 21:28.287
like I didn't even exist.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.592
But don't worry,
I didn't tell her I'm from

21:29.636 --> 21:32.247
some weird alien
dimension that imploded.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.640
- That's not what I meant.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.251
- But that's all that
matters here.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.210
We're different while everyone
else is basically the same

21:39.254 --> 21:41.169
and living
their best possible life.

21:41.212 --> 21:46.305
I mean, just look at Mom.
- No, Lois is not your mother.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.176
- No, no, you're right.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.134
In this world,
she has two perfect boys,

21:50.178 --> 21:52.920
Superman for a husband.
She's way better off.

21:52.963 --> 21:55.792
- Hey, look, you know--
you know it's not that simple.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.968
- No, Dad, it's super simple.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.188
I never should've come here.

22:00.231 --> 22:01.624
- We talked about this, okay?

22:01.668 --> 22:03.278
It's just--it's gonna
take some time.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.281
- No, I've been here
three months!

22:06.325 --> 22:08.979
That's more than enough time
to realize that I don't belong.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.546
- Nat, please.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.722
- I just wish I died
like I was supposed to.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.957
- You're late.
- Is that dinner?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.351
- Unless you're cooking
something else.

22:35.136 --> 22:38.313
- How'd it go with Sarah?
- It was good.

22:38.357 --> 22:42.012
- Good?
- Yeah, good.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.405
- That's it?

22:43.449 --> 22:45.407
- What do you want me to say?

22:45.451 --> 22:48.236
- You could start by giving me
an actual answer.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.934
- I--I did and then
you got all weird about it.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.980
- Excuse me?

22:53.023 --> 22:55.635
- We went to Atlas Pond.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.288
- Where you got arrested?

22:57.332 --> 22:58.855
- Yeah, I--

22:58.899 --> 23:01.292
I checked with
the owners first. It was fine.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.773
Look, I--I just--

23:03.817 --> 23:07.995
I don't want to talk about it,
all right?

23:08.038 --> 23:10.998
Can--can I just go up
to my room now?

23:29.799 --> 23:31.758
- Hey, how did it go?

23:31.801 --> 23:34.456
Did Sarah totally lose it
or what?

23:34.500 --> 23:37.285
- Not really.
She wasn't feeling well.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.983
- Really? Did she say that?

23:40.027 --> 23:41.071
- Yeah.

23:43.247 --> 23:45.380
- You sure she was
telling the truth?

23:46.512 --> 23:49.123
- Wait, why--why would
she be lying about that?

23:49.166 --> 23:50.777

I'm sure it's all good.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.875
- Yeah.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.227
- And just so you know,
I think we might get a little

24:06.270 --> 24:08.838
talking-to from Dad later.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.666
- About what?

24:12.538 --> 24:14.540
- If Daniel can get
Aidy's support,

24:14.583 --> 24:18.239
he might be able to take
the farm vote away from Dean.

24:18.282 --> 24:20.371
- I think he's got a real shot.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.765
- Yeah, me too.

24:22.809 --> 24:25.028
- So what does Kyle think about

24:25.072 --> 24:28.771
all the work
you've been putting in?

24:28.815 --> 24:30.773
- Why? Did he say something?
- No.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.906
- He's not jealous, is he?
- Well, I--I don't know.

24:32.949 --> 24:34.821
Why would he be jealous?
- No, no, it's just him and I

24:34.864 --> 24:36.562
have talked about this
repeatedly.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.172
- I'm sure you have.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.609
I'm just saying you might
wanna check in with him.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.219
- Right.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.656
So he did say something.

24:43.699 --> 24:46.049
- Lana, he didn't say anything.

24:46.093 --> 24:48.443

24:48.487 --> 24:50.750
Kyle can be so frustrating.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.969
I mean, it doesn't matter
how many times I ask him,

24:53.013 --> 24:55.972
he just--
- Avoids the question?

24:57.583 --> 24:59.889
- It makes me feel like
he's hiding something from me.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.717
- But then acts like somehow
you're to blame

25:01.761 --> 25:02.936
for wanting to know
what's wrong.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.198
- Exactly.
- Even though

25:04.241 --> 25:05.591
all you're trying to do
is help,

25:05.634 --> 25:07.027
it turns into
some kind of argument

25:07.070 --> 25:09.551

the bad guy.

25:09.595 --> 25:12.162

25:15.296 --> 25:18.212

25:18.255 --> 25:20.475

I just really don't know how.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.699

we're just gonna have to

25:26.742 --> 25:28.265

25:28.309 --> 25:29.789

figure it out.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.799
Did you feel that?

25:45.848 --> 25:48.111
- Was that an earthquake?

25:48.155 --> 25:49.591
- Doubtful.

25:49.635 --> 25:50.940
Probably just some

25:50.984 --> 25:53.247

25:55.075 --> 25:57.381
- No.

25:57.425 --> 26:01.255

26:01.298 --> 26:05.041

26:05.085 --> 26:06.782
Well, you're home early.

26:06.826 --> 26:08.915

26:08.958 --> 26:10.699

26:10.743 --> 26:13.006
- Well, he didn't get
handsy with you now, did he?

26:13.049 --> 26:17.706
- No, no, no, no, no.
He was a total sweetheart.

26:18.707 --> 26:21.057
It was just--

26:22.363 --> 26:25.148
- It's too much?
- Yeah.

26:25.192 --> 26:28.630
- Yeah, well, he's insecure.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.023
I mean, let's be real,

26:30.066 --> 26:31.981
kid is batting
way out of his league.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.070
- Dad.

26:34.897 --> 26:38.205
- You're the alpha
in this relationship, okay?

26:38.248 --> 26:41.425
You set the tone

26:41.469 --> 26:43.863
and I think best thing
you can do is just be honest.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.739
- That wasn't terrible advice.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.785
- That's kind of where
I'm setting the bar as a dad.

26:56.136 --> 26:59.008
- Why don't you hand me
that 3/8 over there,

26:59.052 --> 27:01.271

this old bird fired up, yeah?

27:01.315 --> 27:02.664
- Yup.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.504

27:18.071 --> 27:20.508

27:22.597 --> 27:24.468
- What did that one do?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.646
- He just wasn't ready to talk
about Sarah yet

27:27.689 --> 27:30.474
and I couldn't let it go.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.651

27:46.926 --> 27:49.711

27:49.755 --> 27:51.974

Ever since you told me
to say something to Natalie

27:57.937 --> 28:00.679
and I just stood there frozen.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.159
- You were in shock.

28:03.203 --> 28:04.465
All of us were.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.075
- It's more than that.

28:06.119 --> 28:09.992
She was my daughter
in that other world and...

28:10.036 --> 28:16.477

and calling me "Mom..."

28:16.520 --> 28:19.001

28:19.045 --> 28:21.743
And in that moment,

28:21.787 --> 28:23.571

28:23.614 --> 28:26.269
must have felt
the day she left us.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.228

28:28.271 --> 28:30.360
how she could do that
my entire life,

28:30.404 --> 28:36.410
how a mother could just...

28:36.453 --> 28:38.760
abandon her children.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.284
And now I know.

28:41.328 --> 28:42.590
She didn't feel.

28:42.633 --> 28:43.765
She didn't feel anything.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.506
Not for me. Not for Lucy.

that for sure.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.814
- Yes, I can, Clark.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.598
And every time
you ask me about Natalie

28:50.641 --> 28:53.166

it's just bringing up

28:53.209 --> 28:56.691

and all of this guilt.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.562
- You have nothing
to feel guilty about.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.390

29:00.434 --> 29:02.131
- But she's not your daughter.
- I know, but--

29:02.175 --> 29:06.657
- Lois, her mom died.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.628
Look, you guys are both
15 years old.

38:46.672 --> 38:51.372
I get wanting to be intimate
with someone,

38:51.416 --> 38:53.679
but that's an adult decision

38:53.722 --> 38:55.333
and it comes with
some pretty adult feelings

38:55.376 --> 38:58.597
that you might not
be ready for yet.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.427
So if and when you guys
have any questions,

39:02.470 --> 39:05.647
you can always come to us,
okay?

39:05.691 --> 39:08.476
- All right, um,
how old were you

39:08.520 --> 39:12.132
the first time you, you know?

39:15.309 --> 39:16.919
- Older than both of you.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.838
- I just want you guys
to be responsible

39:22.882 --> 39:24.187
and more importantly,

39:24.231 --> 39:27.408
you respect
whoever you're with.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.149
Always. Is that clear?

39:29.192 --> 39:30.368
- Yes.
- Of course.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.370
- Okay.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.415
Good talk.
- Wait, does that mean that

39:34.459 --> 39:36.156
Mom's not gonna
talk to us now or--

39:36.199 --> 39:37.331
- Oh, no.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.637
No, you're gonna hear

39:38.680 --> 39:40.726
more than a few words from her.

39:40.769 --> 39:43.468
I think things are gonna get
back to normal around here.

39:43.511 --> 39:44.904
Finally.

39:47.515 --> 39:48.777
- What is it?

39:58.178 --> 40:00.398
- What's going on?

40:00.441 --> 40:03.096
- Well, I went to finally
talk to Natalie

40:03.139 --> 40:05.533
and I realized I couldn't
let her leave again.

40:05.577 --> 40:08.536
- So--so what? They're--
they're moving here now or...

40:08.580 --> 40:10.582
- They're gonna stay
in Smallville for a while

40:10.625 --> 40:11.974
and see how they like it here.

40:12.018 --> 40:14.803
And if it's okay with you guys,

40:14.847 --> 40:17.980
stay at the farm until
they find someplace to live.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.637
- Whatever we can do to help.

40:26.249 --> 40:27.729
- Natalie, this is
my husband Clark,

40:27.773 --> 40:29.644
and these are my boys,
Jonathan and Jordan.

40:29.688 --> 40:31.907
- Hi, it's nice
to finally meet you.

40:31.951 --> 40:33.300
- Yeah, you too.

40:33.343 --> 40:34.562
My dad's told me
a lot about you guys.

40:34.606 --> 40:35.911
- Why don't we go inside

40:35.955 --> 40:37.347
and you guys
can show her around?

40:37.391 --> 40:38.479
- Sure, yeah.

40:45.617 --> 40:46.792
- You sure
you're okay with this?

40:46.835 --> 40:49.229
- Of course.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.666
Happy to help a friend.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.494
- Thanks, man.
