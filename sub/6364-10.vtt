14:31.004 --> 14:33.371
- Spoke to our victim's wife?
- Yeah, shauna webber.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.373
She's in there right now.
Says her husband's a saint.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.975
How he can't change
a light bulb.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.576
- She doesn't think
he was our mastermind.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.878
- No, she does not.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.280
- Why don't i believe you,
shauna?

14:42.282 --> 14:43.915
- What are you asking?

14:43.917 --> 14:47.218
Did travis kill someone?
No way.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.320
- Why was his license plate
on a car we found

14:49.322 --> 14:52.223
At a murder scene last night?
- I have no idea.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.925
- All right,
where was he last night?

14:53.927 --> 14:57.328
- We went bowling.
I rolled a 168.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.131
- Help us connect the dots.

15:00.133 --> 15:04.035
The first murder
led us right to travis's door.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.337
- He ever mention
the other victim?

15:06.339 --> 15:09.507
Luther markov, older guy,
psych professor.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.678
- We had dinner with luther
two weeks ago.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.449
Luther works with travis's dad.
They're friends.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.984
He--he's--

15:19.986 --> 15:22.987
- He was killed.

15:22.989 --> 15:26.057
Who's travis's father?

15:31.398 --> 15:33.131
- You shouldn't have.
- Yeah.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.400
You know,
it's to remember us by.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.604
You know,

15:39.606 --> 15:42.073
There was a time
when this thing

15:42.075 --> 15:43.942
Was my closest friend.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.010
Used to take her out
on stakeouts.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.079
- Different rules back then.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.015
- Well, same rules,
just different coppers.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.055
Sterilized it for you.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.526
- Dr. Isaac webber,

16:01.528 --> 16:04.162
Professor of psychology
at central chicago university.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.431
- The first victim we found
was webber's mentor,

16:06.433 --> 16:08.032
Lifelong friends.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.134
- Can't be a coincidence that
his mentor and his son

16:10.136 --> 16:12.370
Both wind up dead
inside 24 hours.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.105
- It's not a coincidence.
The son's license plate

16:14.107 --> 16:16.107
Was found at the murder scene.
- Right, but his prints weren't.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.276
- We recovered two shotguns.
Both had defaced serial numbers

16:18.278 --> 16:19.744
And no ballistic matches.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.647
- The liquid in the tub was
homemade nitric acid,

16:22.649 --> 16:24.649
And victim had been in there
for two days.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.284
Then all of a sudden
outta the blue,

16:26.286 --> 16:28.219
We get called to the house
to do a spot check?

16:28.221 --> 16:30.588
Come on.
There were no mistakes.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.091
Someone wanted to link
travis webber to that murder.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.993
That license plate was planted.
- Hold on. Hold on.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.695
I got something.
- This is a restraining order

16:37.697 --> 16:40.131
Webber took out against
one of his students.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.467
Kid named spencer york.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.235
- Let's get him down here.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.704
I wanna know where he's been
the last two days.

16:51.344 --> 16:55.013
- Excuse me, we're looking for
dr. Webber's class.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.248
- Found it. I'm abby.
I'm his teaching assistant.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.050
He was late,
so i canceled class.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.719
- Did he call in today?
Did he e-mail you?

17:01.721 --> 17:04.155
- Uh, no.
Is something wrong?

17:04.156 --> 17:06.723
- Do you know
a spencer york?

17:06.726 --> 17:09.460
- We're both getting
our doctorate degrees

17:09.462 --> 17:11.561
Or, he was,
until he cracked up.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.665
- Cracked up?
- Yeah. He--

17:14.666 --> 17:17.402
Here, i have a video.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.737
Three weeks ago, spencer was
defending his thesis.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.705
He'd been spiraling
for months--

17:21.708 --> 17:24.675
Untreated bipolar disorder,
he wasn't sleeping.

17:24.676 --> 17:27.512
I heard dr. Webber took out
a restraining order

17:27.513 --> 17:29.680
After the...Meltdown.

17:32.318 --> 17:36.154
- Your inabilities
to follow my notes

17:36.156 --> 17:39.490
Have everything to do with
your mental capacity

17:39.492 --> 17:42.260
And nothing to do with
my research or my notes

17:42.262 --> 17:44.562
Or anything like--
don't interrupt me!

17:46.699 --> 17:48.833
Isaac, i need you
to understand

17:48.835 --> 17:51.836
Because you somehow can't get it
through your head that this--

17:51.838 --> 17:53.337
- Sir, calm down.
- Don't touch me!

17:53.339 --> 17:55.339
Don't touch--

17:55.341 --> 18:00.578
Isaac. Isaac! This isn't--
i wasn't finished, isaac!

18:00.580 --> 18:03.815
- Spencer's thesis was titled
<i> spheres of influence,</i>

18:03.817 --> 18:07.819
How one person can transfer
psychic trauma onto another.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.455
- So now he's trying to finish
his thesis in the real world?

18:10.457 --> 18:12.423
- Yeah, sure.
York gets booted outta school,

18:12.425 --> 18:13.724
Decides to take it out
on his old professor.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.560
- Only he doesn't attack him.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.463
- He attacks the people
in his sphere.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.432
First webber's mentor.
- Then, his son.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.334
- Dr. Webber was
a father figure,

18:23.336 --> 18:25.403
Or spencer wanted him to be.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.473
- [sighs]
so who's next in his sphere?

18:28.475 --> 18:30.475
- I mean, his wife's
the logical answer,

18:30.477 --> 18:32.844
If logic is applicable here.
Thank you.

18:32.846 --> 18:34.712
We gotta get to york's.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.781
I'm gonna have voight track down
dr. Webber.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.121
- "mayor emanuel"?

18:43.123 --> 18:45.189
Pfft!
Jeez, moving up in the world.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.125
- Hey, sarge.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.329
[sighs]
they took her back to the o.R.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.698
She was developing compartment
syndrome or something.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.567
So they had to release
some pressure.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.537
- Two surgeries in one day?

18:59.539 --> 19:02.140
- Yeah.

19:03.877 --> 19:06.144
- Third one gets you
free toppings.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.448
Sorry.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.524
It's really good
you're here.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.563
- [sighs]

19:29.669 --> 19:32.537
- You know i got shot
in the ass, right?

19:34.707 --> 19:37.441
Sure, you tell people
it's the hip,

19:37.443 --> 19:39.510
The lower, lower back side
of the hip,

19:39.512 --> 19:42.480
But i got shot in the ass.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.849
- Jeez,
i'm sorry to hear that.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.319
- Well, it was different,
being a lady police.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.588
They didn't want you,
a lot of guys.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.891
So when i woke up,
no one was there.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.727
Dawson was interrogating
the jagoff that shot me.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.396
Interrogating.
Broke his jaw.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.398
I understood this,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.800
But when you're waking up...

20:04.804 --> 20:06.971
I shouldn't have been alone.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.809
[cell phone buzzes]

20:16.716 --> 20:19.250
- They're closing in
on a suspect.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.719
- Hey, if you can help find
this guy, go.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.321
- You'd stay?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.756
- They'd have to drag me away.

20:25.758 --> 20:29.327
Plus, you know, they got,
like, five hbos here.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.296
- Thank you, sarge.
- Yeah.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.305
- Hey, how's burgess?

20:41.307 --> 20:45.376
- She's great. Great.
Just a little follow-up thing.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.878
- Okay. York's got the second
floor unit.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.848
Everybody look sharp.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.724
[step creaks, car alarm blares]

21:01.394 --> 21:04.562
- I'll check it out.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.638
- What is it?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.006
- This step is loose.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.755
- Oh.
- That's it.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.023
We need to call the bomb unit.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.824
This whole place
could be rigged.

21:33.826 --> 21:34.892
- There could be hostages
inside.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.728
- Are we going
or are we waiting?

21:37.730 --> 21:39.463
- I'm gonna call the bomb unit.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.638
- Ruzek!

21:47.640 --> 21:49.874
No!

21:54.013 --> 21:54.445
.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.314
- [groaning]

21:56.316 --> 21:58.482
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

21:58.484 --> 21:59.517
- Yeah.

22:01.587 --> 22:04.322
- You okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.357
- The car was rigged.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.759
- I know, that's why i yelled,
"ruzek, no."

22:10.096 --> 22:11.796
- So now you're
johnny on the spot.

22:11.797 --> 22:13.497
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What do you think it means?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.566
What happened last night?
- Hey, man, what's your problem?

22:15.568 --> 22:17.401
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- Hey, i might hit one of you!

22:17.403 --> 22:18.836
Same team, guys.
Come on.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.571
- Ruzek, take a walk.
- Come on.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.640
- Take a walk!

22:22.642 --> 22:24.742
Hey, we gotta check
the building for victims.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.510
- We gotta get the bomb unit
out here first

22:26.512 --> 22:28.546
And crowd control.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.415
- Halstead. Thank god.

22:31.417 --> 22:32.850
Hey, isaac webber turned up.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.752
York had him tied up,
but he's fine.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.854
Antonio and olinsky
are headed over there now.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.956
Thanks.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.726
- Hey, jay.
- Yeah.

22:41.727 --> 22:44.495
- Don't look now...Behind us,
there's a guy watching.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.703
- Shaved head, tan jacket?
- Yeah.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.439
- I knew spencer was unwell.

22:55.441 --> 22:58.409
I should have done more,
but he was lost in his work.

22:58.411 --> 22:59.810
He was fixated on it.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.479
- He indicate
where he was headed?

23:01.481 --> 23:04.982
- No, he came here,
he tied me up. He had a gun.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.885
He was nonverbal.
He was muttering.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.454
He's in a schizophrenic state.
He's paranoid.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.056
- Isaac, where's your wife
right now?

23:12.058 --> 23:14.592
- Susannah? Why?
- Is she at work?

23:14.594 --> 23:17.428
- I-i don't know.
She went to meet a client.

23:17.430 --> 23:20.631
She left and--i don't remember--
you think york when after her?

23:20.633 --> 23:22.433
- Hey, slow down.
Where was she headed?

23:22.435 --> 23:24.502
- I don't know!

23:47.894 --> 23:50.027
- Where you going, spencer?

23:56.569 --> 23:58.736
You've been busy.

23:58.738 --> 24:02.640
Two bodies we found so far.

24:02.642 --> 24:05.042
How many more
are we gonna find?

24:07.013 --> 24:09.013
- We also found
your fingerprints

24:09.015 --> 24:11.449
At both crime scenes.

24:11.451 --> 24:15.519
We have you on video
at radioshack buying wiring

24:15.521 --> 24:18.522
And transmitting devices.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.691
- You can't put the house
back together.

24:20.693 --> 24:25.463
- Uh-huh.
Where is susannah webber?

24:25.465 --> 24:26.730
You didn't run,

24:26.732 --> 24:29.600
So you wanted to be caught?

24:35.041 --> 24:38.209
Tell us where she is.

24:40.546 --> 24:43.647
- Your father died
when you were a kid.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.250
That right, spencer?

24:49.055 --> 24:52.723
Dr. Webber, he was like
a father figure.

24:52.725 --> 24:56.727
Only he let you twist
when your mind went.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.497
That's cruel.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.532
That musta hurt.

25:01.534 --> 25:05.836
But, spencer,
if you think that hurt,

25:05.838 --> 25:08.873
If you think
that's real pain,

25:08.875 --> 25:10.708
You keep ignoring us.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.143
'cause either you're gonna tell
us or we're gonna find her,

25:13.145 --> 25:16.614
And i hope for your sake
that when we do, she's alive!

25:22.221 --> 25:25.523
So where is she?

25:25.525 --> 25:27.591
Where's susannah webber?

25:32.798 --> 25:36.934
- You can't put the house
back together.

25:44.544 --> 25:47.311
- Still no leads on
susannah webber's location.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.246
- No, we pinged her phone,
got no response.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.315
I checked with her client--
she missed their meeting.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.551
- All right, so he makes it
in the big city

25:53.553 --> 25:55.353
On a professor's salary.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.154
She looks expensive to maintain.
How does that work?

25:57.156 --> 25:59.823
- Makes her own money.
She flips high-end houses.

25:59.825 --> 26:02.192
Sold this one for 4.2 million
last year.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.929
- York isn't finished, okay?
He planned all this.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.630
If we caught him that easy,

26:06.632 --> 26:07.998
It's 'cause there's something
else he wants us to find.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.266
- Well, he wants to break
his old mentor.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.335
So where'd he stash
this guy's wife?

26:11.337 --> 26:13.704
Where's he leading us next?
- And what's with the number?

26:13.706 --> 26:15.039
- The sole contents
of the wallet

26:15.041 --> 26:17.775
We pulled off spencer york.
Hazard a guess.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.643
[telephone rings]

26:19.645 --> 26:21.712
- Untraceable, unlisted,
unhelpful.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.682
It's a weird one.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.586
- All right,
i'll be right there.

26:28.588 --> 26:31.789
Boss.
- Go.

26:42.868 --> 26:46.236
- You have reached
a nonworking number.
