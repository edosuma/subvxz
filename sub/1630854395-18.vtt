on my couch.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.803
And I can't flip
the cushion over

00:11.845 --> 00:14.556
because you got chili
on the other side.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.933
- It's not my fault
you keep your cushions

00:16.975 --> 00:19.102
where I keep my chili.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.812
Don't worry.
I'll clean it.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.445
- Ooh, couch con queso!

00:29.821 --> 00:31.656
Don't mind if I do.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.286
- Gordo, don't you want
to tell them

00:36.327 --> 00:38.121
about the fight you got into
at school today?

00:39.414 --> 00:42.709
- No,
that pretty much covers it.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.003
- What?
- You got into a fight?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.671
- Are you okay, Gordo?

00:46.713 --> 00:48.840
Who did this to you?
- Yes, tell us.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.717
So I can hunt down
that little psychopath

00:50.759 --> 00:53.094
and slash the tires
of his Big Wheel.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.305
- His name's Mateo.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.599
He lives at 5543 86th--

00:57.640 --> 00:59.392
- Okay, okay.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.728
Everyone,
keep your earrings on.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.024
How do we know Chance
isn't the little psychopath?

01:06.066 --> 01:08.943
- This sweet face?

01:08.985 --> 01:11.738
- I have the same sweet face,
and I've done stuff.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.574
Okay, Gordo,
come over here.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.118
It's time you and I
had a friendly chat.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.790
Where were you
on the morning of today?

01:24.709 --> 01:27.379
- I was at recess
just minding my business,

01:27.420 --> 01:30.256
waving my arms around
like a regular boy.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.218
- And then what happened?

01:33.259 --> 01:35.679
- Then Mateo's face
got in the way.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.598
- So you punched him.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.475
- If that's
what you wanna call it.

01:41.726 --> 01:42.560
- I want the truth.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.146
- You can't handle the truth!

01:48.024 --> 01:49.484
But yeah, I punched him.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.447

Chance punched someone.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.591
- You gotta do something

02:13.633 --> 02:16.428
before he turns
into a Menendez brother.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.388
- Oh, don't worry.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.849
We're coming in hot...

02:20.890 --> 02:22.726
with fresh baked cookies.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.979
- It's how we get him
to open up.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.606
Like the children's book says,
if you give a mouse a cookie,

02:28.648 --> 02:29.858
it talks about its feelings

02:29.899 --> 02:32.027
and stops punching
the other mice.

02:32.068 --> 02:35.613
- You're rewarding bad behavior
with cookies.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.615
- You should know
I mixed the regular trash

02:37.657 --> 02:40.076
with the recycling on purpose.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.828
So punish me too, Daddy.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.246
Ay!

02:48.084 --> 02:50.879
- Chance acted out, and
according to my therapist...

02:50.920 --> 02:52.964
- Ay, here we go.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.425
- A child needs help
understanding their behavior,

02:55.467 --> 02:56.843
not just someone saying,

02:56.885 --> 02:58.178
"You didn't put
your crayons away,

02:58.219 --> 03:01.056
so now baby Jesus is crying."

03:01.639 --> 03:03.767
- You never left them
lying around again.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.894
And I also used
"eat your veggies

03:05.935 --> 03:08.063
or Yolanda gets parole."

03:08.104 --> 03:09.356
Oh, oh, and my favorite:

03:09.397 --> 03:10.690
"You dyed your hair purple,

03:10.732 --> 03:13.568
and now your abuelita's
in the hospital."

03:14.277 --> 03:16.738
- This is exactly what
my therapist was talking about.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.617
You used emotional manipulation
to scare me into behaving.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.912
- Stop saying that,
or you'll cause a forest fire.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.665
Why are you talking to this
therapist about me anyway?

03:27.707 --> 03:30.710
Isn't your life
interesting enough?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.545
- Definitely not.
I read all her DMs.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.589
Ain't nobody sliding in there.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.551
- I talk about everything
in therapy, Mom.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.679
It helps me
process my feelings.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.472
You'd understand it
if you tried it sometime.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.391
- Mm,
therapy's a waste of money,

03:44.432 --> 03:47.477
according to my psychic,
Madam Jeanette.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.312
- Then I'll pay for it.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.855
You should talk to Dr. Brenda.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.649
- Fine, I will,

03:52.691 --> 03:55.068
so I can tell her to stop
poisoning you against me...

03:55.110 --> 03:58.571
and to go by her last name
like a real doctor.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.240
- That is her last name.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.409
She's Dr. Glenda Brenda.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.161
Anyway,
whatever gets you in the door.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.038
It'll be great to finally prove
to my therapist

04:07.080 --> 04:08.748
that you're a real person

about the lack of chips
in this cookie.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.809
I thought we talked about this.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.941
- My therapist said
he might react this way.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.444
But there's a tool we can use
to get him to open up.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.446
Follow my lead.
- Got it.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.615
- We get it, Chance.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.476
Did Mateo say something
to make you upset?

05:09.517 --> 05:11.644
- Yeah, he said Snorlax

than Charizard.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.526
Everyone knows
that's a filthy lie.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.445
- Actually, Gordo,
there's a lot of debate.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.530
If you consult--
- Not the time, nerd!

05:25.200 --> 05:27.660
- It's okay to be upset.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.245
But if you can
recognize those feelings,

05:29.287 --> 05:30.413
then you can calm yourself.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.166
That is called
emotional regulation.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.951
[normally] We got him

of dollars on parenting books,

was a pair of googly eyes

06:13.164 --> 06:14.624
we won playing Whac-A-Mole.

06:16.251 --> 06:19.212

Chance resorted to violence.

In boxing,

06:45.196 --> 06:46.281
I spotted him.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.326
- Chance got into that fight
at school

06:50.368 --> 06:51.870

he's mimicking the violence

you let him watch on TV.

- Okay, hang on a second.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.082
Seeing things on TV

"Real Housewives," and--

07:37.123 --> 07:38.124

09:08.631 --> 09:11.217
that criticizing
the way I raised you

09:13.470 --> 09:18.767
your own shortcomings
as a parent onto me.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.604
- Did she really say
"shortcomings"?

10:51.276 --> 10:52.569
You could just do what I do.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.195
- What do you do?

10:54.237 --> 10:56.072
- Any time I get in trouble,

10:56.114 --> 10:57.866
I look all sad and say,

10:57.907 --> 11:00.160
"I'm so sorry.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.079
And it'll never happen again."

11:05.415 --> 11:08.877
- Wow, man, you're like
Cate Blanchett in "Titanic."

11:10.670 --> 11:12.172
- If it's really bad,

11:12.213 --> 11:14.841
then I throw in a "I wuv you."

11:16.259 --> 11:19.471
And make sure it's "wuv"
with a W.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.849
- And your parents
fall for that?

11:22.891 --> 11:25.560
[as Goosey] Yup.
Then I do what I want.

- You realized
it's finally time

11:44.079 --> 11:46.915
to put that thing on ice?

11:46.956 --> 11:51.127
- I was minding my own business
like a regular grandpa,

11:51.169 --> 11:54.339
and your son punched me
in the nuts.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.509
- I'm not happy
he's still hitting people,

11:57.550 --> 12:01.304
but at least he's doing it
in a funny way now.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.057
- Whatever. You guys think
you're such great parents.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.351
He told me
he fakes his apologies.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.477
- What?
- Yeah.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.312
That he says, like,
"I'm so sorry,"

12:09.354 --> 12:11.940
and that
"I'm never gonna do it again."

12:15.318 --> 12:17.779
- I can't believe
Chance lied to us.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.906
- I don't know where he learned
to lie like that,

12:19.948 --> 12:22.283
but it wasn't
from a war hero like me.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.287
- Oh, I hate myself
for saying this,

12:26.329 --> 12:29.165
but it's not
your father's fault.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.422
- Don't turn me on, vieja.
I'm still healing.

12:37.382 --> 12:38.258
- Ay.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.552
Dr. Brenda is right.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.804
Here you are blaming
everyone in the world--

12:42.846 --> 12:47.017
me, your father,
Manny Pacquiao--

12:47.058 --> 12:49.644
instead
of holding yourself accountable

12:49.686 --> 12:51.563
for Chance's bad behavior.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.106
- That's right.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.858
I didn't come back from the
moon to be treated like this.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.067
Ay.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.614
- If you want Chance
to stop manipulating you,

13:01.656 --> 13:05.243
you have to do
what any good parent would do:

13:05.285 --> 13:07.495
manipulate him better.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.502
- And all she's missing
is a coat made of dalmatians.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.090
- I actually think
your parents might be right.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.800
We have to try something new
with Chance,

13:20.842 --> 13:23.261
'cause everything we're doing
right now, it doesn't work.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.637
- Then I guess it's time to do

13:24.679 --> 13:27.432
the one thing
I said I would never do:

13:27.474 --> 13:30.101
parent like I was parented.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.314
- You're gonna disappear on him
for ten years?

13:36.691 --> 13:37.817
- I meant like my mom.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.027
- Mm.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.236
Yes, that makes more sense.

I'm a child of immigrants.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.329
Emotions were a luxury
we couldn't afford.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.540
We had to save it for funerals.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.417
Oh, my mother,

13:54.459 --> 13:58.588
she really knew how
to throw herself at a casket.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.882
- I don't care!

14:00.924 --> 14:03.343
You've been talking my ear off
for 40 minutes.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.054
I'm ready to punch myself
in the nuts.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.640
If it makes you
feel any better,

14:08.682 --> 14:10.725
there's no one
Mayan blames more than me.

14:10.767 --> 14:11.810
- Aw.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.561
It does.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.982
She also thinks that you're
a bad influence on Chance.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.693
If I were you,
I'd watch my step.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.862
Mayan wasn't afraid
to throw out the cable box.

14:22.904 --> 14:26.282
And unlike you, that
actually brought her pleasure.

She not only let you back
in her life.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.505
She opened her home to you.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.758
So when you don't
respect her boundaries,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.135
it's triggering.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.220
- Wow, you learned a lot
in therapy.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.723

that therapist in my face.

you can pee counts as outside.

Grandpa doesn't make the rules.

Not good.

- Chance, the messiness,
the hitting, the lying,

16:19.813 --> 16:21.439
you're picking it all up
from Grandpa.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.192
- Yeah, and having him around

16:24.234 --> 16:26.444

What did you people do

to follow your advice

18:13.885 --> 18:15.470
and parent like you--

18:15.512 --> 18:17.681
which you manipulated us
into doing.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.307
- My therapist said--

18:19.349 --> 18:20.475
- I called Dr. Brenda,

18:20.517 --> 18:22.185
and she says
she's never met you.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.900
- Damn it.
I thought I had another week.

18:31.194 --> 18:34.948
- Gordo, why don't you go
play some games in the kitchen?

18:34.989 --> 18:36.991
- I don't know what we're
supposed to do with Chance.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.661
- Well,
being a good parent is tough,

18:39.703 --> 18:41.913
which is why I've avoided it.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.915

we're failing him.

- Aw, he's doing
what seven-year-olds do.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.713

your boundaries like I do

with anything.

Come here.

We made some bad choices.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.305
But so did you.

So that means
that when you misbehave,

19:52.650 --> 19:54.277
there has to be a consequence.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.321
- Like a cookie?

19:57.489 --> 19:59.240
- A real consequence.

- Gluten-free cookie.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.121
- [chuckles] No.

Your consequence is going to be
