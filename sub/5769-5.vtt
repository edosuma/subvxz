WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.267
You're stable.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.029
That's what I'll sell
as your publicist.

00:05.070 --> 00:06.298
Stability.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.400
You don't know how
many firms I work with

00:09.440 --> 00:12.409
where it's just constant
screaming and backbiting.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.637
I mean, here, you're all
just one big happy family.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.704
Joely, could you give me
a minute?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.547
Oh, certainly, certainly.

00:18.580 --> 00:20.411
I'll be right out here.

00:20.450 --> 00:21.769
Stability.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.524
What?

00:30.560 --> 00:32.152
Alicia is
leaving the firm

00:32.200 --> 00:35.124
with Cary, and she's taking
our top clients.

00:48.180 --> 00:50.171
She...

00:51.710 --> 00:53.348
What?

00:53.380 --> 00:55.644
I sat down with one
of my clients, Sonya Rucker,

00:55.680 --> 00:57.739
and asked
if she was leaving the firm.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.655
She is.

00:59.690 --> 01:03.524
With Cary and Alicia,
to their new firm.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.551
She...

01:06.860 --> 01:08.748
With just Cary, right?

01:08.800 --> 01:09.869
No.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.663
Alicia as well.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.431
I...

01:21.410 --> 01:23.105
VVhen?

01:23.150 --> 01:24.799
Uh...

01:25.850 --> 01:27.818
She's a partner.

01:27.850 --> 01:31.786
Yes, and she had a $10,000
stipend to decorate her office,

01:31.820 --> 01:35.187
but she stopped three weeks ago,
spending only half.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.348
She has been planning this
for three weeks.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.828
Will...

01:46.870 --> 01:48.690
I know this is hard.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.871
Document everything.

02:22.570 --> 02:24.561
*

02:30.580 --> 02:32.571
You're leaving?

02:33.950 --> 02:35.838
No.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.882
I just got here.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.808
What?

02:42.960 --> 02:45.679
You and Cary...

02:45.730 --> 02:47.857
are leaving?

02:51.300 --> 02:53.268
Will...

02:53.300 --> 02:54.699
No.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.503
It's an easy answer.

02:56.540 --> 02:59.634
_ It falls
into the "yes or no" category.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.799
You and Cary are leaving

03:03.850 --> 03:05.738
and you're taking
some clients with you?

03:08.850 --> 03:10.340
Yes.

03:10.390 --> 03:13.484
And you decided this
three weeks ago?

03:15.790 --> 03:17.621
Yes.

03:17.660 --> 03:19.423
I'm sorry.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.662
Of course. That helps.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.929
It's time I try something...

03:25.970 --> 03:27.528
new.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.939
I took you in.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.607
No one wanted you.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.845
I hired you.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.518
I pushed for you.
Will...

03:41.550 --> 03:42.812
This is a business decision.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.488
You were poison!

03:44.520 --> 03:46.852
This firm got you back
on your feet.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.551
And I will always be thankful.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.478
And this is how you show it?

03:50.530 --> 03:51.883
By stealing our clients?

03:51.930 --> 03:53.818
We didn't steal anything.
These were clients that...

03:53.860 --> 03:56.397
You have a fiduciary
responsibility to this firm,

03:56.430 --> 03:58.364
and you were going
behind our backs.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.334
I didn't go
behind any backs. I...

04:00.370 --> 04:01.632
You negotiated Diane's
exit package.

04:01.670 --> 04:03.331
You asked me to!
And the whole time,

04:03.370 --> 04:04.462
you knew you were leaving.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.432
Nothing I was doing

04:06.480 --> 04:08.471
impacted that negotiation.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.501
Oh, God.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.472
God, you're awful,

04:12.520 --> 04:15.273
and you don't even know
how awful you are.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.311
This is how you and Diane
started this firm.

04:17.350 --> 04:18.908
Don't you dare compare...

04:18.950 --> 04:20.713
Okay.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.284
(sighs)

04:22.330 --> 04:23.683
Okay.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.857
First of all, you're fired.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.926
Second...

04:28.960 --> 04:32.020
I'm taking
this company cell phone

04:32.070 --> 04:34.959
until such time as...
Excuse me. That's my personal...

04:35.000 --> 04:36.433
And I'm taking it
into possession

04:36.470 --> 04:37.767
until I can determine
which clients

04:37.810 --> 04:39.004
you've attempted to steal.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.007
You can't do that.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.543
Get out of here, Alicia.

04:42.580 --> 04:44.775
Right now.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.812
You're fired.

04:48.450 --> 04:50.441
No.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.086
You don't want to push this.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.950
I'm a partner.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.820
You want to remove me,

05:02.870 --> 05:05.589
you need the majority vote
of the executive board,

05:05.630 --> 05:09.066
and then you need a vote
of the full board.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.374
I need you to stand right here.

05:17.410 --> 05:18.570
If she tries to contact anyone,

05:18.610 --> 05:20.942
_ document it and contact me
immediately. Do you understand?

05:20.980 --> 05:22.413
I do.

05:22.450 --> 05:24.042
This is Will Gardner
on the 28th floor.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.354
I need four security guards
up here right now.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.084
What should I do?

05:34.100 --> 05:36.523
(sighs)
Give me your phone.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.561
Do we tell Cary or somebody?

05:38.600 --> 05:39.862
I can't tell you what to do.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.891
At some point, you and I
are going to be deposed

05:41.940 --> 05:42.929
about what we did just now.

05:42.970 --> 05:45.359
You have to do things
on your own.

05:45.410 --> 05:46.877
I'll tell Cary.
Just so you know,

05:46.910 --> 05:48.434
Will is gathering up
the executive committee

05:48.480 --> 05:50.641
and the full board
to relieve me of my duties,

05:50.680 --> 05:52.079
(whispering):
and that will take an hour.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.042
So hurry.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.547
This is Alicia Florrick, yes.

05:54.580 --> 05:55.945
We need to know if we can move

05:55.980 --> 05:57.117
into the office space
a week earlier.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.851
They found out.

06:02.890 --> 06:04.721
Alicia's being fired,
and we have a half hour.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.921
Damn it, we don't have
all the files.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.996
Yeah, you download;
I'll get the contacts.

06:12.030 --> 06:14.464
We need a quorum, Howard.
Let's go.

06:15.670 --> 06:16.659
What?

06:17.870 --> 06:19.132
Yo, what do you need?
I'm still working...

06:19.170 --> 06:20.899
I need you to shut down
all client files

06:20.940 --> 06:22.498
to associate computers
right now.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.847
Why?
'Cause I need it.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.108
No, I mean,
what about the associates

06:25.150 --> 06:27.175
already with files in use?
Shut them down now.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.643
No one_accesses files
until I say so.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.749
Tell me the name of anyone
who tries to access files.

06:31.790 --> 06:32.882
Okay. Anything else?

06:32.920 --> 06:34.148
No. Yes.

06:34.190 --> 06:35.953
One of the partners,
Alicia Florrick,

06:35.990 --> 06:37.924
don't let her
into the files, either.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.951
I'll be with you in a moment.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.166
Told you they were up
to something.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.758
I told you
they were screwing us.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.960
Yes, and we'll
congratulate you later.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.433
We need to act now.
Where's Howard?

06:47.470 --> 06:49.700
Present.
We need one more for a quorum.

06:49.740 --> 06:50.968
How about Alicia?
She just needs to be here.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.102
We can still vote her out.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.971
What'd she do?
Diane, we need you.

06:54.010 --> 06:55.170
No, she doesn't
work here anymore.

06:55.210 --> 06:57.678
We haven't signed
her exit package.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.200
We need a quorum
on the executive committee.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.548
You're in. I move that
the executive committee

07:01.580 --> 07:03.013
immediately take to
the full partnership

07:03.050 --> 07:05.143
a proposal to relieve
Alicia Florrick of her duties.

07:05.190 --> 07:06.179
Wow, really?

07:06.220 --> 07:08.108
Diane discovered Alicia
was planning to leave

07:08.160 --> 07:10.128
with Cary Agos and several
of our top clients.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.980
Which clients?
We're trying to
find out now.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.089
All those in favor
of relieving Alicia Florrick

07:14.130 --> 07:14.926
of her duties?

07:18.630 --> 07:19.995
DAVID:
You're the one
who found it out.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.996
Are you really
going to vote against it?

07:22.040 --> 07:24.929
Give me a second, please.

07:33.050 --> 07:35.473
There's someone trying to
download a file right now.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.487
VVho?
Carey.

07:36.520 --> 07:37.987
Yeah, I know. Cary Agos.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.511
No, no, the other
Carey-- Zepps.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.078
This way. Come with me.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.757
Would you like me
to come back?

07:44.790 --> 07:45.779
No. Stay!

07:49.160 --> 07:51.128
Carey Zepps, you're fired.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.661
We need you to get out
of the offices right now.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.258
No, that stays.
You take nothing.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.938
My car keys are in my office.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.562
Your things will be collected
and sent to your home.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.134
If you need your car keys,
wait in the lobby.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.204
They'll be delivered to you.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.776
Now, get the hell out of here.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.184
(quietly):
Zach, what are you doing?

08:12.220 --> 08:13.881
Heading to school.
Uh, hey, have you seen

08:13.920 --> 08:15.217
my Lincoln essay?
I can't find it.

08:15.260 --> 08:16.158
I need your help.

08:16.190 --> 08:18.055
You were talking
about the cloud at my work,

08:18.090 --> 08:19.182
files being saved up
to the cloud.

08:19.230 --> 08:21.528
Mom, did you maybe put it
in your room or something?

08:21.560 --> 08:25.064
Do me a favor. I need all_
my company contacts and files

08:25.100 --> 08:27.068
saved from the company cloud
to my cloud,

08:27.100 --> 08:28.692
my personal cloud.
Can you do that?

08:28.740 --> 08:30.901
You have no idea what any
of those words mean, do you?

08:30.940 --> 08:31.929
No, but can you...

08:33.780 --> 08:35.907
Can you transfer my files
so I can use them at home?

08:35.940 --> 08:37.601
Uh, I mean,
I don't know. Maybe.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.242
Mom, I have chemistry,
all right? Can't this wait?

08:39.280 --> 08:41.111
No, unfortunately not.
Someone is trying to block me,

08:41.150 --> 08:43.812
and I need to do it now.
Do you need my password?

08:43.850 --> 08:46.148
Okay. Okay, okay, I'm fine.
I'm fine here.

08:46.190 --> 08:48.055
This is as far
as you can take... No.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.978
No. Look,

08:50.030 --> 08:51.918
I know you started firing people
before I could download

08:51.960 --> 08:54.258
all the files,
but I'm staying here.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.256
Let's go.
You want a lawsuit?

08:56.300 --> 08:57.460
Go for it.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.037
Lockhart/Gardner doesn't control
the lobby of this building.

09:00.070 --> 09:02.129
So let me go.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.009
DAVID:
Go down all
those corridors

09:09.040 --> 09:10.598
down to that
west main door,

09:10.650 --> 09:13.642
and I want you to look
in every single door...

09:17.120 --> 09:19.918
(quietly):
They don't know I'm with you.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.562
DIANE:
You know what
offends me most?

09:41.240 --> 09:43.606
The fact that I
stood up for you.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.277
I got you hired.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.912
That offends you the most?
Really?

09:48.950 --> 09:50.781
Not the fact
that every fourth-year

09:50.820 --> 09:52.185
was promised a partnership?

09:52.220 --> 09:53.619
So _that's who _
you're in league With?

09:53.660 --> 09:54.752
All the fourth-years?

09:55.790 --> 09:57.951
No, I'm making a point.

09:57.990 --> 09:59.150
You brought this on yourself.

09:59.190 --> 10:01.226
The sad thing is, Cary,

10:01.260 --> 10:03.296
I was your mentor.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.924
If you had a disagreement,
you could've come to me.

10:05.970 --> 10:08.268
Every step of the way,
I was here to help you...

10:08.300 --> 10:10.200
Oh, come on, Diane,
this is not a camp.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.059
When I came

10:11.110 --> 10:12.930
to your door,
you didn't want to teach.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.629
You wanted to_ know...
It's ama2ing

10:14.680 --> 10:16.375
how you've misinterpreted
every single thing.

10:16.410 --> 10:18.105
How did I misinterpret?
You fired me.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.674
The first time.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.018
I put more hours into this place
than anything,

10:22.050 --> 10:24.416
I did my best work for you,
and you fired me.

10:24.450 --> 10:25.849
We fired you because of Alicia,

10:25.890 --> 10:27.209
and you sure
got over that quick.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.284
I need to start something
on my own,

10:28.320 --> 10:29.958
the same way that you
and Will needed to start.

10:29.990 --> 10:31.082
Then do it without our clients.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.358
They're not your clients!

10:32.390 --> 10:34.221
When was the last time
you looked at Chumhum?

10:34.260 --> 10:36.399
When was the last time?
You're taking Chumhum?

10:36.430 --> 10:38.295
I'm-I'm using that
as an example.

10:38.330 --> 10:41.265
We're ready.
I'll be right there.
List all of the associates

10:41.300 --> 10:42.289
leaving with you.
You can guess.

10:42.340 --> 10:45.229
If you don't want all
of the fourth-years fired,

10:45.270 --> 10:47.238
you list all of the associates
leaving with you.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.305
I am deathly serious.

10:49.340 --> 10:50.443
Why do you care?

10:50.480 --> 10:52.368
You're gonna be
a Supreme Court justice.

10:52.410 --> 10:54.310
Why does this even matter
to you?

10:54.350 --> 10:55.339
I don't like betrayal.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.369
And I like
this firm.

10:56.420 --> 10:57.318
Now, you write
down the names.

10:58.350 --> 11:00.409
And, Cary, you're fired.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.087
For a second time.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.055
Yes, a second time.
Get the hell out.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.656
(sighs)

11:14.370 --> 11:15.496
(all clamoring)

11:15.540 --> 11:17.360
WILL:
The executive committee
called this emergency...

11:17.410 --> 11:20.174
Hold on! Quiet down, please!

11:21.480 --> 11:24.176
This is an emergency meeting
of the full partnership

11:24.210 --> 11:25.370
with one cause of action.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.310
We have a partner
who is actively trying

11:27.350 --> 11:28.419
to steal our top clients.

11:28.450 --> 11:29.417
(softly):
Chumhum.

11:29.450 --> 11:31.008
Who said that?

11:31.050 --> 11:33.109
(quietly):
Cary. Agos, Cary.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.355
(clears throat)

11:35.390 --> 11:38.928
Now, as you all know,
a partner can't be removed

11:38.960 --> 11:41.258
without the majority vote
of the full partnership.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.325
We've just been told

11:43.370 --> 11:46.396
this new firm is making a play
for Chumhum.

11:46.430 --> 11:47.431
(all murmuring)

11:47.470 --> 11:49.392
We will now entertain a motion

11:49.440 --> 11:51.431
to remove Alicia Florrick
of her duties.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.974
ROBYN:
They don't know
that I'm with you.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.375
Should I stay here after you go?

11:56.410 --> 11:58.776
I can't say anything.

11:58.810 --> 12:01.176
I think I can feed you stuff
from the inside.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.188
WOMAN:
Alicia?

12:03.220 --> 12:04.482
What's going on?

12:04.520 --> 12:06.442
Candace, hi.

12:06.490 --> 12:09.459
I forgot, we have
a depo today, don't we?

12:09.490 --> 12:10.855
We do. Can I come in?

12:10.890 --> 12:13.029
Yes, of course. Please.

12:13.060 --> 12:15.119
What's going on?
Are you under arrest?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.991
I'm in the process...

12:20.340 --> 12:22.433
I'm forming my own firm,

12:22.470 --> 12:26.065
and I think
I'm being pushed out today.

12:26.110 --> 12:28.328
Uh, okay,
but I don't understand.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.847
You're my lawyer.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.302
Will Gardner's your lawyer, too.

12:32.350 --> 12:35.069
Yeah, but you're the one
I've mostly dealt with.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.246
Where is this new firm?

12:36.280 --> 12:37.349
Can my case
go with you?

12:39.050 --> 12:41.883
Actually, I...
I can't answer that right now.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.251
WILL:
Excuse me, Alicia.

12:43.290 --> 12:44.450
Could you step out here
a second?

12:58.540 --> 13:00.531
After a vote
by the full partnership,

13:00.580 --> 13:03.071
you've been officially removed
from your position.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.408
Gentlemen, will you
escort her out, please?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.038
I want my phone back.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.479
After we ascertain whether

13:37.510 --> 13:39.444
there are Lockhart/Gardner
materials on it,

13:39.480 --> 13:41.311
we will messenger it to you.

13:41.350 --> 13:42.886
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

13:50.460 --> 13:52.052
This was never meant personally.

13:52.090 --> 13:54.490
I don't give a damn.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.038
(sobbing)

14:31.530 --> 14:33.532
(indistinct chatter)

14:56.660 --> 14:58.582
WILL:
She didn't do anything?

14:58.630 --> 15:00.097
No, she just waited
for you to return.

15:00.130 --> 15:02.018
She didn't try to contact
any of the associates?

15:02.060 --> 15:02.822
ROBYN:
No.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.191
WILL: Good. Hang
around here today.

15:04.230 --> 15:05.197
Okay.

15:05.230 --> 15:06.219
Kalinda, you got a second?

15:06.270 --> 15:07.589
Yeah, sure.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.306
Where were you?

15:10.340 --> 15:13.036
At home.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.138
What's up?

15:15.680 --> 15:17.238
We fired Alicia and Cary.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.077
And the other Carey.

15:19.110 --> 15:20.975
They were intending
to steal our top clients.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.212
Wow.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.217
Yeah.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.252
Now, here's what I need to know.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.679
Are you leaving with her?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.620
With Alicia?

15:31.660 --> 15:33.548
Uh, no.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.249
Because if you are,
you need to leave right now.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.289
I'm not.

15:37.330 --> 15:39.127
David Lee says you are.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.388
Well, David Lee says
a lot of things.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.532
You're friends with Alicia,
and she

15:42.570 --> 15:43.559
didn't tell you about leaving?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.407
No.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.307
Clearly,
I-I wasn't friend enough.

15:48.340 --> 15:52.447
Okay. I need to know which
associates are leaving with them

15:52.480 --> 15:55.415
and which clients,
and I need to know fast.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.247
Okay.
You don't know now?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.212
No, but I can find out.

16:00.190 --> 16:01.612
Things are crumbling
around here, Kalinda,

16:01.660 --> 16:04.185
and I need to know
who I can trust.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.128
Can I trust you?

16:05.160 --> 16:06.650
You can.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.025
Good. Find out what's going on.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.091
DAVID:
Okay. Come on.
Move it along.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.290
Stand over there.
Right over there.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.306
What's going on?

16:21.340 --> 16:22.568
Who are they?

16:22.610 --> 16:24.669
The associates Cary
says he's leaving with.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.575
We're lining them up
to fire their asses.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.087
Cary's screwing
with you.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.109
They're all
protected classes.

16:31.150 --> 16:34.381
He named them because he knows
you can't fire them.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.682
Damn it.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.119
Get to the fourth-year
associates.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.422
Fire them.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.189
Get them out
of the building now.

16:40.230 --> 16:41.652
I'll go.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.628
So, about stability...

16:45.670 --> 16:47.137
You're hired. _ _
You're our new pubIICIst,

16:47.170 --> 16:48.592
and I need you to
start right away.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.595
Yeah, certainly.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.107
We had to fire a partner.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.562
And she's the wife
of the next governor.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.677
Okay, get up! You're fired.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.246
Let's go.

17:00.450 --> 17:03.317
Hands up from the keyboard.
You're both fired.

17:04.820 --> 17:07.357
Okay, the first step
is we call all the clients.

17:07.390 --> 17:09.210
Everybody, get on a cell phone.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.058
All the partners. We split up
the list across the hall...

17:12.090 --> 17:13.694
Who's that?
The nurse's deposition.

17:13.730 --> 17:15.027
That's now?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.525
And what are we telling
the clients?

17:17.570 --> 17:19.367
We give the reasons
for firing Alicia Florrick.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.288
And don't just make it
about the new firm.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.137
The reason has to do
With performance.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.432
She was stealing money.

17:24.470 --> 17:25.505
No, we can't say that.

17:25.540 --> 17:26.529
Next we go to court.

17:26.570 --> 17:27.730
We get a restraining order

17:27.780 --> 17:29.304
against further pursuit
of our clients.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.773
We can't win that.
It's not about winning.

17:30.810 --> 17:32.277
It's about slowing them down.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.811
It's about an off-speed pitch.

17:33.850 --> 17:36.648
They've had one month
to pursue our clients.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.386
Now we have the advantage.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.751
Okay, I get it.

17:45.790 --> 17:48.054
I can find my own way home.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.259
Who else did they get?
Are you the last?

17:58.310 --> 17:59.334
Beth was still there.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.576
They still haven't found
her and Robyn.

18:00.610 --> 18:02.271
They can get us
downloads.

18:02.310 --> 18:03.379
Will blocked files
to everyone but partners.

18:03.410 --> 18:05.241
How are people working?

18:05.280 --> 18:06.770
They aren't.
They're too busy battling us.

18:06.810 --> 18:08.846
Okay, we have to get on
with all our clients,

18:08.880 --> 18:10.381
let them know we're
leaVIng a week early.

18:10.420 --> 18:11.546
Who had the cappuccino?
The tea?

18:11.590 --> 18:12.614
Guys, we need to move fast.

18:12.650 --> 18:13.719
We need to split up our list.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.216
Will will be on
with everybody.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.750
We need to move up
our press release.

18:16.790 --> 18:17.757
All right, I'm on it.

18:17.790 --> 18:18.552
I already called
the new offices.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.296
We can pick up the
keys tomorrow.

18:22.460 --> 18:23.768
(overlapping chatter)
Hey. Hey, guys.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.529
If we don't get our
clients in line,

18:25.570 --> 18:27.197
we_ don't have
a firm to open.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.639
Cary, are you
on Chumhum?

18:28.670 --> 18:30.137
Yeah, I'll call
Neil Gross.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.728
Who's our second-best client?

18:31.770 --> 18:33.306
Vonerich at SVI
Holdings. I'll call.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.205
(phone ringing)
Steve Vonerich.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.299
Oh, hello.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.476
Yes.

18:38.510 --> 18:40.671
No, I hadn't heard.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.915
Yes, we fired Mrs. Florrick,
unfortunately.

18:42.950 --> 18:45.282
We _discovered some issues
in her performance.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.582
What issues?

18:46.620 --> 18:48.485
Well, we'd rather not say,
at least

18:48.520 --> 18:50.329
not until the authorities
look into it,

18:50.360 --> 18:53.295
but I want to assure you,
we looked into her work

18:53.330 --> 18:55.355
on your account
and found no money missing.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.595
Mr. Vonerich, it's Alicia. Hi.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.928
Yes, I wanted to get back
to you about the firm.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.435
for me to move right now.
They got to him.

19:03.470 --> 19:05.529
_ Were there some
finanCIal irregularities?

19:05.570 --> 19:07.572
They said
there may be some worries

19:07.610 --> 19:10.306
about money being taken
from accounts you serviced.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.170
Do you still want
another investigator?

19:13.780 --> 19:15.418
Do I st...?

19:15.450 --> 19:19.341
Look, Lockhart/Gardner
is starting to crumble,

19:19.390 --> 19:21.312
and Will is going crazy.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.681
He's lashing out at you
with everything he's got.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.449
So, do you still
want another investigator?

19:26.490 --> 19:28.253
We have one.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.495
Robyn doesn't
win cases.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.760
Robyn's within our budget.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.394
That last deal that you
offered me-- I'll take it.

19:36.970 --> 19:39.200
Kalinda, what's going on?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.301
Look, Lockhart/Gardner
can survive

19:41.340 --> 19:43.979
without you, Alicia
and half a dozen others,

19:44.010 --> 19:46.945
but... it can't survive
without Diane.

19:48.550 --> 19:50.643
I can read the writing
on the wall.

19:52.820 --> 19:55.288
Okay. You really want to
join us, get us something.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.787
Get us the Chumhum files.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.981
They've thrown up a firewall.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.497
Where do you want me
to bring them? Here?

20:00.530 --> 20:01.997
155 Emerson.

20:02.030 --> 20:04.590
Okay.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.291
We lost Vonerich's
hedge fund.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.558
And the Paisley Group.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.397
We're being badmouthed
to the clients.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.362
It's Will.
He's in commando mode.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.401
ANTHONY:
So what do we do?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.637
What are you doing?

20:16.680 --> 20:18.500
Distracting him.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.949
(phone rings)
Hello?

20:19.980 --> 20:21.311
Candace.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.578
Hi. It's Alicia.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.339
I just wanted to check and see
how the deposition was going.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.756
It's not going anywhere
at the moment. Where are you?

20:27.790 --> 20:29.314
Downstairs.
Is Will not with you?

20:29.360 --> 20:32.022
He's here. He's just...

20:32.060 --> 20:33.857
He's on his phone.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.992
The concern here, Candace, is

20:35.030 --> 20:37.794
that it took us six_ months
to set this dep05ition up.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.320
And if it doesn't
happen now,

20:39.370 --> 20:41.031
they could delay
another six months.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.697
No,no,no".
Yes, she's
the governor's wife,

20:42.740 --> 20:44.503
but that isn't
always a good thing.

20:44.540 --> 20:45.859
Mr. Gardner?

20:45.910 --> 20:47.730
We need to start
the deposition now.

20:48.810 --> 20:50.744
Okay, good.
I'll call you back.

20:50.780 --> 20:51.747
Candace, yes.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.771
I just need a few more minutes.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.310
No. I'm sorry.

20:55.350 --> 20:57.443
We need to do this now,
or they'll leave.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.481
Okay. Let me get my files.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.353
GRACE:
Mom, pick up the phone.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.620
Hey, Mom,
pick up the phone.

21:05.660 --> 21:09.050
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.568
Hey, Mom,
pick up the phone.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.431
Hey, Mom, pick up...

21:13.470 --> 21:14.767
Hello?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.735
Who is this?

21:17.770 --> 21:19.567
Will Gardner.

21:19.610 --> 21:21.601
Hi. Um, this is Grace.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.039
Is my mom there?

21:23.080 --> 21:25.275
She's, um...

21:26.110 --> 21:28.044
I have her cell phone.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.480
Hey, look, uh, can you give her
a message for me?

21:30.520 --> 21:31.919
I, um... I can't find
my permission slip

21:31.950 --> 21:33.349
for my Campus Faith field trip.

21:33.390 --> 21:36.086
Um, I need her to call them.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.520
I don't know
if I'm gonna see her.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.596
Maybe... try her at home?

21:40.630 --> 21:42.598
I'm at home,
and she's not here.

21:42.630 --> 21:46.066
Look, if you see her, can you
just have her call me, please?

21:46.100 --> 21:47.397
Okay.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.431
Thanks.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.202
(phone ringing)
Hello. Cary Agos.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.936
NEIL:
Oh, Mr. Agos,
what can I do for you today?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.106
Hello, Mr. Gross.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.448
I'm thrilled
we got you.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.072
I've been trying you
on your cell.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.577
Uh, yeah, I was up in the air.

22:00.620 --> 22:01.814
Now I'm on the ground,

22:01.850 --> 22:03.442
heading to your offices
to discuss this suit.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.809
So can it wait?

22:04.850 --> 22:05.817
Actually, it can't, sir.

22:05.850 --> 22:06.680
Uh, can we...

22:06.720 --> 22:08.483
can we meet you
at your Chumhum offices?

22:08.520 --> 22:09.782
Uh, my offices? Why?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.718
Because we're making

22:12.760 --> 22:14.455
the move today.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.821
We're leaving Lockhart/Gardner
and starting Florrick/Agos.

22:16.860 --> 22:19.397
You're starting
your own firm today?

22:19.430 --> 22:21.830
Yes, sir.
No time like the present.

22:21.870 --> 22:23.508
Well, um, I should
warn you, Cary.

22:23.540 --> 22:25.531
My peeps on the West Coast
aren't too thrilled

22:25.570 --> 22:27.435
with the idea of me
leaving Lockhart/Gardner

22:27.480 --> 22:29.436
for what's essentially
a start-up.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.675
Start-up?
With the governor's wife?

22:31.710 --> 22:33.541
Yeah, well,
that's a two-way street.

22:33.580 --> 22:34.911
Um, we've been reviewing

22:34.950 --> 22:36.417
the political rules
for the governor,

22:36.450 --> 22:37.815
and, um, kind of a tangle.

22:37.850 --> 22:38.942
Five-year plan.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.218
They won't be
a tangle with us, sir.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.389
Let us come by, and we'll lay
out our five-year plan for you.

22:42.420 --> 22:43.387
Just how I want to spend
my afternoon:

22:43.430 --> 22:44.419
listening to my next five years.

22:44.460 --> 22:45.427
(phone rings)
Hello?

22:45.460 --> 22:46.859
Alicia, it's Candace.

22:46.890 --> 22:49.950
Shouldn't we be going after
wrongful termination,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.490
not sexual harassment?

22:51.530 --> 22:52.519
Candace, is the deposition
happening now?

22:52.570 --> 22:55.459
Yes, but all of Mr. Gardner's
questions are geared

22:55.500 --> 22:56.467
toward sexual harassment.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.001
I thought we'd
lose harassment.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.167
But didn't you fire our client
because she was too pretty?

23:00.210 --> 23:01.529
MAN:
No, no, it wasn't

23:01.580 --> 23:02.933
that she was too pretty.
There was...

23:02.980 --> 23:04.538
Actually, could you
hold on a second?

23:04.580 --> 23:06.445
Hey, wait.

23:09.620 --> 23:10.644
Candace.

23:10.690 --> 23:11.679
Is that Alicia?

23:11.720 --> 23:12.846
Yeah.

23:12.890 --> 23:15.552
She thinks we should be going
after wrongful termination.

23:15.590 --> 23:16.659
May I, please?

23:19.830 --> 23:23.493
Alicia, you've been removed
from your position at this firm.

23:23.530 --> 23:25.418
Yes, and she called me.
I didn't call her.

23:25.470 --> 23:26.619
You engage with any
of our clients again,

23:26.670 --> 23:27.568
and we'll take you to court.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.567
For what?

23:28.600 --> 23:29.635
For tortious interference.

23:29.670 --> 23:32.503
Oh, come on. The only one
interfering here is you.

23:32.540 --> 23:34.201
Telling our clients
that I stole money?

23:34.240 --> 23:35.935
All_ we told the _clients
is you were fired.

23:35.980 --> 23:38.198
And you contact any of them
again and I swear, Alicia,

23:38.250 --> 23:40.718
you and Cary will not have
a penny left in the bank.

23:40.750 --> 23:41.876
Oh, go to hell.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.683
No, you go.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.484
Oh... your daughter called.

23:46.520 --> 23:49.683
She needs you to call her school
to let her go on a field trip.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.823
Oh. When was this?

23:50.860 --> 23:51.849
About 40 minutes ago.

23:51.890 --> 23:52.982
Oh. Okay, thanks.

23:53.030 --> 23:54.657
You're welcome.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.758
(sighs)

23:58.030 --> 23:59.725
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

24:01.670 --> 24:03.638
What did they say?
They don't have

24:03.670 --> 24:04.807
the Chumhum files.

24:04.840 --> 24:05.829
What? What don't they have?

24:05.870 --> 24:07.235
The Chumhum ﬁles.
Cary said that?

24:07.270 --> 24:08.635
Yeah. They're trying to
meet with Neil Gross.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.648
We need to get court time
right now.

24:10.680 --> 24:11.749
Was there anything else?
They have offices

24:11.780 --> 24:13.099
at 155 Emerson.

24:13.150 --> 24:14.708
Oh, I know that building.

24:14.750 --> 24:15.910
I'm on it.

24:15.950 --> 24:17.713
Department of Health, please.

24:17.750 --> 24:20.014
Anyone else here
working with them?

24:22.690 --> 24:24.681
Yes.

24:25.730 --> 24:26.754
WILL:
Robyn.

24:26.790 --> 24:27.597
Yeah.

24:31.670 --> 24:32.819
I'll introduce it.

24:32.870 --> 24:34.565
Then throw it to me.
I'll handle the lawsuit.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.692
Alicia, you'll handle
the ethical rules.

24:35.740 --> 24:36.695
NEIL:
Florrick/Agos.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.833
There you all are.

24:38.870 --> 24:40.906
Welcome
to my house.
(chuckles)

24:40.940 --> 24:42.976
You remember Carey Zepps.
Yeah, I sure do.

24:43.010 --> 24:45.001
One of you needs to change
your name, though.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.608
Come on up.
Oh.
Yeah, this guy.

24:46.650 --> 24:47.947
Alicia Florrick?

24:47.980 --> 24:49.140
Yes.
Cary Agos?

24:49.180 --> 24:51.284
This is a restraining order
preventing you from meeting

24:51.320 --> 24:53.686
any representative of
Chumhum. I read it.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.051
It charges tortious...
Tortious interference

24:55.090 --> 24:56.648
with trade.
That's right.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.958
Well, this is awkward.

24:59.990 --> 25:02.026
Tell me when you guys
work this out.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.891
(sighs)
Damn it.

25:03.930 --> 25:05.261
Yep.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.860
Well, because it doesn't make
any sense, Doug.

25:11.910 --> 25:15.073
I haven't made any decisions
on pensions, period.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.806
Oh, okay, yeah.
(chuckles)

25:17.850 --> 25:20.546
Let's go to a more
neutral subject.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.844
My wife. Go. Shoot.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.883
No. What?

25:29.020 --> 25:30.988
Eli.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.248
Well, I'm gonna have
to check into that.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.258
No, I can't confirm or deny,

25:35.300 --> 25:37.052
and I'll get
back to you.
What?

25:37.100 --> 25:38.692
What's wrong?
That was Doug Fletcher

25:38.730 --> 25:39.526
from the Tribune.

25:39.570 --> 25:41.834
He says that Alicia
was fired today.

25:41.870 --> 25:43.701
She...

25:43.740 --> 25:44.866
What?

25:44.910 --> 25:46.832
Have you heard anything?
No.

25:46.870 --> 25:47.939
Fired from her job?

25:47.980 --> 25:50.699
That's what he says.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.671
All we did was block them.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.940
Now we got to get a
meeting with Neil Gross.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.277
(phone ringing)

26:01.220 --> 26:02.585
Hello.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.188
Hello?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.686
Will?

26:09.030 --> 26:10.725
Yes.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.624
Where's Alicia?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.298
She's, uh...

26:16.340 --> 26:18.365
out.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.162
She's not here anymore.

26:20.210 --> 26:21.131
Why?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.000
She was in the process
of stealing clients.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.702
No, she was in the process
of trying to form her own firm,

26:25.750 --> 26:27.342
and they were
unhappy clients.

26:27.380 --> 26:29.177
Peter, you don't want
to get involved in this.

26:29.220 --> 26:32.189
I've always been involved
in this, okay?

26:32.220 --> 26:33.187
You're the governor-elect.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.859
I'm a private citizen
with a practice to run.

26:35.890 --> 26:37.255
You can't get involved in this

26:37.290 --> 26:38.848
without it blowing back
and hurting you.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.755
Okay, thanks for the advice,
jackass.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.392
Listen to me.

26:42.430 --> 26:43.761
I'm not just a governor.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.028
I am a husband.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.868
And I will handle this
as a husband.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.993
Okay, should I be
recording this?

26:50.040 --> 26:52.008
Am in trouble now?

26:52.040 --> 26:53.337
Am I gonna be audited?

26:53.370 --> 26:55.076
Are you really trying
to turn this around?

26:55.110 --> 26:56.179
You sleep with my wife,

26:56.210 --> 26:58.178
you fire her
and tell me...

26:58.210 --> 27:00.075
Excuse me. Nobody was talking
about sleeping...

27:00.110 --> 27:01.145
Oh, gosh.

27:01.180 --> 27:02.909
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?

27:02.950 --> 27:04.019
No, I'm just trying
to figure out

27:04.050 --> 27:05.415
what I should feel bad about,
buddy.

27:05.450 --> 27:06.815
Well, try this on for size.

27:06.850 --> 27:08.818
You don't want to make me
your enemy.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.681
And you certainly don't want
Alicia and me together.

27:11.730 --> 27:12.754
Okay, good to know.

27:12.790 --> 27:13.950
I'm hanging up now.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.353
I have a business to run.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.391
Yeah, let's see how that goes.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.391
ALICIA:
We need to get
the offices painted.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.930
Yeah, but one
office at a time

27:23.970 --> 27:25.198
so we can still
move in tomorrow.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.207
What about the furniture?
I'll get on that.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.207
Wait, wait, wait.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.207
We got a problem.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.434
Just got back from our offices.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.299
Ran five blocks.

27:30.340 --> 27:32.103
The Department of Health
just closed down

27:32.150 --> 27:33.447
the building
for fumigation.
What?

27:33.480 --> 27:36.017
Yeah, they got an anonymous tip
there was a vermin infestation.

27:36.050 --> 27:37.210
So, when can we move in?
Two months.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.387
Oh, God, you're kidding!
What?

27:38.420 --> 27:40.718
We need a place right now.
It's Will.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.715
It's David Lee.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.715
His fingerprints
are all over it.

27:42.760 --> 27:43.727
Wait, how did they even know

27:43.760 --> 27:44.727
where we were going?

27:44.760 --> 27:45.454
We got to delay
our opening.

27:45.490 --> 27:46.684
We wait the two months

27:46.730 --> 27:48.755
until they're done.
No, we go now.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.119
They want us to wait.
Screw them.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.764
Okay, so where
do we work?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.231
(all talking indistinctly
over each other)

27:59.810 --> 28:01.471
Thank you, Your Honor.

28:01.510 --> 28:03.137
That's all we need.
Mom?

28:03.180 --> 28:04.272
Grace, what's going on?

28:04.310 --> 28:05.709
It's my Bible study
from Campus Faith.

28:05.750 --> 28:06.705
What's going on here?

28:06.750 --> 28:07.478
Uh, my firm.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.046
We have to work here a few days.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.047
Yes, that's right, Your Honor.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.308
(indistinct chatter)

28:11.350 --> 28:14.456
WOMAN:
Governor-Elect Florrick's
office.

28:14.490 --> 28:15.752
Oh, hi, Patricia.

28:15.790 --> 28:17.109
I didn't know
we had a meeting.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.422
We don't.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.348
I just wanted
to inform Peter

28:20.390 --> 28:22.051
about some
events today.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.761
Alicia being fired?

28:23.800 --> 28:25.267
She wasn't fired.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.324
She was asked
to leave early.

28:26.370 --> 28:28.998
She was planning to exit
the firm to start her own...

28:29.040 --> 28:30.439
But it's my understanding

28:30.470 --> 28:32.404
that you slapped Alicia
with a restraining order.

28:32.440 --> 28:33.429
I didn't have anything...

28:33.470 --> 28:35.108
I'm no longer involved

28:35.140 --> 28:36.471
with strategy
at Lockhart/Gardner.

28:36.510 --> 28:38.000
But you're in court
this afternoon

28:38.050 --> 28:39.301
defending the
restraining order.

28:39.350 --> 28:42.478
As a formality.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.842
Eli, is this going
to impact the judgeship?

28:47.250 --> 28:49.252
Diane, we are not
in the business

28:49.290 --> 28:50.757
of letting
personal concerns affect

28:50.790 --> 28:52.428
our professional decisions.

28:52.460 --> 28:53.859
You're sure?

28:53.900 --> 28:55.197
I'm sure.

28:55.230 --> 28:57.869
We're fine.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.891
Don't worry.

29:19.550 --> 29:22.417
Let's kill them now
and get it over with.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.984
BAILIFF:
The Honorable
Judge James Chase residing.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.156
CHASE:
This is a matter

29:25.190 --> 29:27.522
of a restraining order,
is that correct?

29:27.560 --> 29:29.448
ALL:
Yes, Your Honor,
we have a motion...

29:29.500 --> 29:31.024
Yeah, that instills confidence.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.799
And this is a motion
to suppress?

29:32.830 --> 29:34.138
ALICIA:
Yes, Your Honor.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.229
There has been no tortious
interference of trade here.

29:36.270 --> 29:38.568
The court is taking sides
in a legally proper splitting

29:38.610 --> 29:40.032
of firm assets.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.129
Your Honor, we wish this
were all legally proper,

29:42.180 --> 29:43.477
but the attorneys
who intend to split off

29:43.510 --> 29:45.501
have made improper avowals...

29:45.550 --> 29:46.574
Excuse me. We have not.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.817
In fact, it has been the
position of the plaintiff...

29:48.850 --> 29:49.839
DAVID:
Sit down and let him speak!

29:49.880 --> 29:51.541
CAREY:
No, you Sit down.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.854
We have just as
much right...
(gavelbangs)

29:53.890 --> 29:55.448
I have laryngitis today.

29:55.490 --> 29:58.379
And I need everyone
to quiet down.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.221
Your Honor, if we could call
a witness to the stand

30:03.260 --> 30:05.160
to speak to the defense's lies?

30:07.900 --> 30:08.992
No, I won't.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.905
What? We discussed this.

30:10.940 --> 30:12.032
And I've changed my mind.

30:12.070 --> 30:13.367
CAREY:
Yeah.

30:13.410 --> 30:14.604
That instills confidence.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.528
Let's go right here,
you little piece...

30:16.580 --> 30:17.979
(gavelbangs)

30:18.010 --> 30:18.772
That's enough.

30:18.810 --> 30:21.176
Now, do you have
a witness or not?

30:21.220 --> 30:23.984
Oh, we have a witness.

30:24.020 --> 30:27.854
WILL:_ _
Now, you were intending
to leave with the other

30:27.890 --> 30:29.517
Lockhart/Gardner attorneys,
isn't that right?
Bitch.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.584
Yes.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.622
And what made you
change your mind?

30:32.660 --> 30:34.355
I thought that they were lying

30:34.400 --> 30:36.095
to the clients
they wanted to take.

30:36.130 --> 30:38.064
Wow, an exact imitation
of the language you need.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.863
Objection!
Sustained.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.095
Restrain
yourself, ma'am.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.562
And how did they lie to clients?

30:43.600 --> 30:45.568
They said that the partners
didn't have

30:45.610 --> 30:47.532
their best interests at heart.

30:47.570 --> 30:49.276
They pursued
the clients for months

30:49.310 --> 30:51.346
before they left,
and then they said

30:51.380 --> 30:53.405
only they could offer continuity
of service on their cases.

30:53.450 --> 30:54.872
And how do you know this?

30:54.920 --> 30:55.909
I was with them.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.212
No further questions.

30:57.250 --> 30:59.081
Thank you.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.088
Beth, what did Lockhart/Gardner
offer you today?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.883
Objection. Vague.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.456
Thank you. I'll clarify.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.355
Did anyone
at Lockhart/Gardner offer you

31:06.390 --> 31:07.652
a promotion
in the last 12 hours?

31:07.690 --> 31:10.250
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.188
Seems relevant_to me.
She's trying to find out

31:12.230 --> 31:13.458
if you bought her testimony.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.365
Did you, Beth,
get offered

31:15.400 --> 31:18.335
any promotion
in the last 12 hours?

31:18.370 --> 31:19.928
Well... (stammers)
here's the thing.

31:19.970 --> 31:22.279
I was offered a partnership
eight months ago.

31:22.310 --> 31:24.540
And then, now that one
of the partners is leaving,

31:24.580 --> 31:26.445
I have been offered
her position.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.675
And who offered you
this partnership?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.312
Mr. Gardner.

31:30.350 --> 31:31.317
I see.

31:31.350 --> 31:33.215
Not exactly 30 pieces of silver.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.979
DAVID:
Objection, Your Honor!

31:35.020 --> 31:36.988
(all speaking indistinctly
over each other)

31:37.020 --> 31:37.884
(gavelbangs)

31:40.490 --> 31:43.129
In the absence of testimony
to the contrary,

31:43.160 --> 31:44.559
I'm keeping
the restraining order in place.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.624
Your Honor!
No.

31:45.670 --> 31:46.989
The status quo will hold

31:47.030 --> 31:48.338
until I can get
a fuller hearing.

31:48.370 --> 31:49.667
But the status quo means
that Lockhart/Gardner

31:49.700 --> 31:50.928
can lobby Chumhum?

31:50.970 --> 31:52.107
Of course, we can.
It's our client.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.199
A client intending
to leave, Your Honor.
(gavelbangs)

31:54.240 --> 31:56.470
Yes, and if they intends
to leave, they'll leave.

31:56.510 --> 31:59.104
In the meantime,
the status quo holds.

31:59.150 --> 32:01.948
The restraining order
stays in place.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.638
We're going to starve you.

32:06.690 --> 32:08.487
You really can't handle
the competition.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.454
That wasn't competition.
You were going behind our backs.

32:10.490 --> 32:12.128
DAVID:
That's right.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.958
Walk away, Judas.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.268
We're coming after you.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.437
All your clients.

32:22.470 --> 32:24.631
Every single one we
worked to make happy

32:24.670 --> 32:27.059
while you swept in at the
last minute to take credit.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.668
We're taking them.

32:28.710 --> 32:30.530
And then you know
what you'll have?

32:30.580 --> 32:32.639
A very nice suite of offices.

32:36.350 --> 32:39.342
Wow. That was amazing.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.187
Who got burned
in Will's bribery scandal?

32:41.220 --> 32:42.710
Which judges?

32:42.760 --> 32:44.159
Parks, Dunaway, Winter.

32:44.190 --> 32:46.181
Why?

32:51.300 --> 32:54.269
Winter-- he's in court now.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.495
What are you doing?

32:56.540 --> 32:57.666
Just_ talk about_
the privacy lawswt.

32:57.700 --> 32:58.667
Don't obviously sell us.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.099
Make it seem like it's
a given he's With us.

33:01.140 --> 33:03.404
I'll talk about
the philosophy of the law.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.273
No, Howard, just nod
and look like you agree.

33:06.310 --> 33:10.314
GROSS:
Lockhart/Gardner!
How we doing?

33:10.350 --> 33:12.716
WILL:
Mr. Gross, my brother.
How are you, sir?

33:12.750 --> 33:14.251
Good. Nice to see you guys.

33:14.290 --> 33:16.656
Why don't you come on up
to my office?

33:16.690 --> 33:17.714
All right.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.182
Hello!

33:19.230 --> 33:21.027
Sorry to bother you again.

33:21.060 --> 33:21.754
Will Gardner? David Lee?

33:21.800 --> 33:23.688
You gotta be kidding me.

33:23.730 --> 33:25.061
Here's a restraining order
preventing you

33:25.100 --> 33:26.089
from meeting with

33:26.130 --> 33:29.099
any representative of Chumhum.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.539
Okay, I'm going
back to work.

33:30.570 --> 33:33.061
Come see me when
you've worked this out.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.179
It's her, isn't it?

33:34.210 --> 33:37.509
Yep. It's an order
from Judge Winter.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.144
Ah, time to play hardball.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.742
All right, thank you very much.
The restraining order worked.

33:46.790 --> 33:47.814
They cannot meet with Chumhum.

33:47.850 --> 33:49.181
ALL:
Yes!

33:49.220 --> 33:50.710
Okay, where are we on clients?

33:50.760 --> 33:51.749
ANTHONY:
Originally we had 12.

33:51.790 --> 33:53.155
We're down to four.

33:53.190 --> 33:54.396
JOHN:
Three. We lost Paisley.

33:54.430 --> 33:56.318
I think we should
talk to Bishop.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.759
No, that's a bad...

33:57.800 --> 33:59.267
He's a Lockhart/Gardner client.
He's fair game.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.562
What's wrong
with Bishop?

34:00.600 --> 34:02.067
He's the top drug dealer
in town.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.362
ROBYN: So? It's
a lot of money.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.537
We said we'd never go there.

34:05.670 --> 34:07.228
I agree with you.

34:07.270 --> 34:09.477
Hi. What's going on?

34:09.510 --> 34:11.501
Oh, hey, Mom.
Uh, I was just telling Carey

34:11.550 --> 34:13.245
about our study group.
Really?

34:13.280 --> 34:16.147
Yes. I should get going back.
It was nice meeting you, Grace.

34:16.180 --> 34:18.080
You, too.
Oh, but try it out.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.644
You'll like it,
the Daily App.

34:19.690 --> 34:20.645
I will.

34:20.690 --> 34:22.112
(both chuckle)

34:22.160 --> 34:23.559
What's that?

34:23.590 --> 34:24.818
Uh, the Daily App?

34:24.860 --> 34:26.782
Just daily Scripture readings.

34:26.830 --> 34:28.195
Ah.

34:28.230 --> 34:29.549
What did I do wrong?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.727
Nothing. Why don't you get back
to your homework?

34:31.770 --> 34:33.829
Okay, Mom.

34:36.170 --> 34:37.797
One minute.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.808
Peter, What are you doing?

34:39.840 --> 34:42.570
I came over to see
how you were domg.

34:42.610 --> 34:44.373
You heard.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.473
Yes, I heard.

34:47.510 --> 34:49.216
That's not the reaction
I was expecting.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.218
I thought you'd be out
on some ledge somewhere.

34:51.250 --> 34:53.741
Oh, no, we're too busy
kicking ass.

34:53.790 --> 34:56.679
Look at you. You look like
you're 25 years old.

34:56.720 --> 34:57.857
Fresh out of law school.

34:59.790 --> 35:03.556
Ready to, um...

35:03.600 --> 35:08.094
ready to, um,
conquer the world.

35:09.900 --> 35:12.733
(Whispers):
Okay, but we have to be quick.

35:12.770 --> 35:14.738
(loud music plays)

35:14.780 --> 35:16.907
ALICIA:
Sorry, there's no
time for that.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.771
We've got ten minutes.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.277
Otherwise, they're
gonna start

35:20.310 --> 35:22.175
making some bad
decisions out there.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.847
Oh, okay.
We wouldn't want that.

35:23.880 --> 35:27.281
Is this What they mean
by "leaning in?"

35:27.320 --> 35:29.652
You want me
toleanin?
Ah!

35:29.690 --> 35:32.181
How's that?

35:32.230 --> 35:37.554
I so... deeply respect you...

35:37.600 --> 35:39.158
as a professional.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.428
(laughs)

35:48.210 --> 35:51.543
* I wasn't born a beauty queen,
but I'm okay With that... *

35:51.580 --> 35:53.172
Hey.

35:53.210 --> 35:56.475
Hawaii's gonna have to wait.

35:56.520 --> 35:59.216
Well, I thought as much.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.810
(doorbell rings)

36:01.860 --> 36:04.328
Once we're up and running.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.885
* Everybody's doing it,
so Why the hell should I? *

36:06.930 --> 36:08.727
DIANE:
There's nothing fairer.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.227
Everybody gets a shot.

36:10.260 --> 36:11.591
CAREY:
We drop our
restraining orders?

36:11.630 --> 36:13.222
DIANE:
We both do.

36:13.270 --> 36:14.897
We get an hour each
with Neil Gross

36:14.940 --> 36:16.464
to pitch our services.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.933
Whoever wins, Wins.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.733
Hi, Alicia.

36:20.940 --> 36:23.238
And Will and David Lee
agree to this deal?

36:23.280 --> 36:24.645
It's not a deal.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.238
And yes, they do.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.770
We drop our
restraining orders,

36:27.810 --> 36:30.574
and tomorrow morning at
10:00 am, you go in.

36:30.620 --> 36:31.939
11:00 am, we go in.

36:31.990 --> 36:34.254
No, we go second.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.913
We can work with that.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.884
As long as we
compromise.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.326
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

36:44.370 --> 36:46.861
GROSS:
Oh, look, it was really
good to see you all.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.299
I should, uh,
probably have

36:48.340 --> 36:50.592
an answer for you
by this afternoon.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.234
Don't forget-- the law
is a bitch of a mistress.

36:53.270 --> 36:54.601
(all laugh)

36:54.640 --> 36:56.278
Ready for you guys.

36:56.310 --> 36:58.801
Lesson for the future:
Don't go second.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.602
So, hit me with it.

37:00.650 --> 37:03.915
Well, sir, Lockhart/Gardner's
a firm Without its worker bees.

37:03.950 --> 37:05.747
We should know. We're the bees.

37:05.790 --> 37:08.953
Uh, we... we looked at the way
you started Chumhum, Mr. Gross,

37:08.990 --> 37:10.685
and you rewarded
work over show.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.655
That's exactly
what we plan to do: reward work.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.521
Billable hours, they won't be
applied as partner hours

37:15.560 --> 37:16.788
unless you actually receive
partner hours.

37:16.830 --> 37:17.797
You're not gonna...

37:17.830 --> 37:18.922
Okay, guys, thanks,

37:18.970 --> 37:21.894
but, um, I'm not going with you.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.862
Why not?

37:23.900 --> 37:25.231
Because of you.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.378
The governorship
should work for me,

37:28.410 --> 37:29.570
not against me.

37:29.610 --> 37:31.271
Your husband, ma'am,
has promised

37:31.310 --> 37:33.744
the most ethical administration
in Illinois history.

37:33.780 --> 37:37.045
I can't have my law ﬁrm jumping
at every ethical shadow

37:37.080 --> 37:38.479
that comes down the pike.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.839
We won't_.
Yes, you Will.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.517
It's the way the world works.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.709
Politics leads.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.988
The law follows.

37:44.020 --> 37:46.420
But, uh, thank you.

37:46.460 --> 37:50.954
And I Wish you the best
of luck with your new firm.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.469
What just happened?

37:53.500 --> 37:55.889
Our firm just went
down the drain.

38:03.580 --> 38:07.038
WILL:
I offered her managing partner.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.048
I offered her Diane's job.

38:09.080 --> 38:09.910
Alicia?

38:09.950 --> 38:12.544
Yes. She _could've been
managing partner

38:12.590 --> 38:14.808
at one of the top firms
in the city,

38:14.860 --> 38:17.658
and she pisses it all away.

38:17.690 --> 38:18.884
I don't understand that.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.319
She wanted to do something
on her own.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.396
With Cary?
That's not on her own.

38:23.430 --> 38:26.319
Will, I know you're hurting,
but she's not the enemy here.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.359
When did you really know
she was doing this?

38:32.410 --> 38:34.776
Leaving?

38:34.810 --> 38:36.402
A week ago.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.976
And Cary?

38:41.980 --> 38:43.379
Three months ago.

38:47.690 --> 38:50.409
I should've told you, Will.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.594
Kalinda, I'm building this firm

38:57.630 --> 39:00.360
into the biggest in the country,
starting today.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.368
And I need to know
who I can trust.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.676
You can trust me.

39:10.710 --> 39:11.779
Are you sure?

39:13.810 --> 39:16.870
Because I'm going to destroy
the competition.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.449
Can you do that?

39:21.990 --> 39:24.754
Yeah.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.120
Good.

39:30.830 --> 39:32.821
(camera shutters snapping)

39:35.200 --> 39:38.169
Good morning.

39:38.200 --> 39:42.079
The pension problem
in Illinois is real

39:42.110 --> 39:44.544
and increasingly insurmountable.

39:44.580 --> 39:47.140
After inauguration,
this is the first issue

39:47.180 --> 39:49.876
I intend to address, and
I'm asking the Republicans

39:49.920 --> 39:54.186
and Democrats to join me
in a bipartisan conversation

39:54.220 --> 39:55.517
to find solutions.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.188
The status quo is not an option.

39:58.220 --> 39:59.187
Not anymore.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.720
Are you going
to negotiate?

40:00.760 --> 40:02.489
There will be no questions
at this time.

40:02.530 --> 40:03.895
Uh, just one
other matter.

40:03.930 --> 40:08.469
I want to talk about taxation
of Internet commerce.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.889
Internet purveyors have,

40:10.940 --> 40:13.500
for far too long,
in my opinion,

40:13.540 --> 40:15.929
enjoyed the benefits
of no taxation.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.801
I find this
to be unfair.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.717
I'm not saying that my opinion
won't change on this matter,

40:21.750 --> 40:24.218
and, of course,
I'm always open to dialogue,

40:24.250 --> 40:27.708
but I will have to be convinced
that there is a reason

40:27.750 --> 40:29.479
for massive social
networking companies

40:29.520 --> 40:31.522
not to carry
their own weight.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.448
Thank you.

40:35.060 --> 40:38.996
Did you just do What
I think you did?

40:39.030 --> 40:40.964
I'm simply stating
my opinion

40:41.000 --> 40:42.865
about the taxation
of Web commerce.

40:42.900 --> 40:44.959
Peter, you can't
be doing that.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.535
It'll come back
to bite us.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.777
You worry too much, Eli.

40:49.810 --> 40:53.177
I want to talk about taxation
of Internet commerce.

40:53.210 --> 40:54.768
Hey. Hey, did you see this?

40:54.820 --> 40:56.173
Internet purveyors...

40:56.220 --> 40:57.915
Alicia's husband just said it.
It's right here.

40:57.950 --> 41:00.043
...have, for far too long,
in my opinion,

41:00.090 --> 41:02.513
enjoyed the benefits
of no taxation.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.687
I find this to be unfair.

41:04.730 --> 41:05.788
Oh, my God.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.127
I'm not saying that my opinion

41:07.160 --> 41:08.252
won't change on this matter.
(laughter)

41:08.290 --> 41:10.019
Damn it.

41:10.060 --> 41:11.994
What?
What is it?

41:12.030 --> 41:13.759
We just lost Chumhum.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.199
What are you
talking about?

41:15.240 --> 41:17.060
The governor-elect
just threatened them

41:17.100 --> 41:18.533
with a big stick.

41:18.570 --> 41:20.231
He can't do that.

41:20.270 --> 41:23.637
Neil Gross, please.
It's Will Gardner.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.602
Well, when will he be back in?

41:25.650 --> 41:27.208
(laughter)

41:27.250 --> 41:28.740
I want to thank you guys

41:28.780 --> 41:31.044
for giving me a chance
to think it over.

41:31.080 --> 41:32.980
I-I'm thrilled
to come with your ﬁrm.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.885
We're thrilled,
too, sir.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.558
And maybe I'll have a chance

41:36.590 --> 41:38.217
to meet your husband
at some point, Mrs. Florrick.

41:38.260 --> 41:40.979
I know he has an open mind
on our tax burden.

41:42.030 --> 41:43.588
He would love that.

41:43.630 --> 41:44.255
Great.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.629
(all cheering)

41:48.670 --> 41:50.638
One second! One second!

41:50.670 --> 41:52.661
Congratulations to Florrick,
Agos & Associates.

41:52.710 --> 41:53.734
Yes!

41:53.770 --> 41:56.102
Yes! We are now a firm.

41:56.140 --> 41:59.541
We've got a
$35-million-a-year client.

41:59.580 --> 42:00.569
Oh, thank you,
thank you.

42:00.610 --> 42:02.111
All we need now is office space,

42:02.150 --> 42:03.572
some more lawyers...

42:03.620 --> 42:06.111
Stationery, assistants.
And computers.

42:06.150 --> 42:07.879
But we got to celebrate
the good news when it comes

42:07.920 --> 42:09.285
because there's gonna be
a lot of bad news.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.311
Wow, talk about negative.

42:11.360 --> 42:14.557
All right, all right,
everybody raise their glasses.

42:15.730 --> 42:17.595
To Florrick, Agos & Associates.

42:17.630 --> 42:18.619
Oh...

42:18.670 --> 42:19.625
Hear, hear!

42:19.670 --> 42:21.160
ALL:
Hear, hear!

42:22.600 --> 42:25.637
Eli, come in for a sec,
will you?

42:32.810 --> 42:34.072
Yes?

42:35.380 --> 42:39.885
Yeah, would you do me a favor
and put together...

42:39.920 --> 42:43.151
a list of other Supreme Court
justice nominees?

42:44.660 --> 42:46.787
Instead of Diane?

42:48.630 --> 42:50.825
Yeah.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.165
Are you sure?

42:59.170 --> 43:00.159
Yeah.
