00:08.476 --> 00:10.611
- Phoebe Thunderman's
journalism class topic--

00:10.711 --> 00:14.082
"Gum Chewing Habits in a Typical
Suburban High School."

00:14.182 --> 00:15.616
[scraping gum]

00:15.716 --> 00:17.551
- [gum splats]

00:19.420 --> 00:22.823
- Phoebe, did you just
spit your gum at me?

00:22.923 --> 00:24.325
- No, Winnie, I would
never do that.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.394
It was somebody else's gum.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.366
I'm doing this fascinating
article on gum chewing.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.836
- By "fascinating"
do you mean "gross"?

00:35.936 --> 00:38.206
- Yeah.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.973
Can I have your gum?

00:40.074 --> 00:41.909
- Don't take this
the wrong way...

00:42.009 --> 00:44.412
...but no.
[pats shoulder]

00:44.512 --> 00:47.615
- I'm starting think
this was a bad idea.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.383
[sighing]
- Hi, Phoebe.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.619
This is for your dumb
gum project.

00:51.719 --> 00:55.156
Ah!

00:55.256 --> 00:57.258
- Help me come up with a new
story for journalism class.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.527
If my article gets on the cover
of the school newspaper,

00:59.627 --> 01:01.162
it's a guaranteed "A".

01:01.262 --> 01:03.131
- Oh, I've got the perfect
headline--

01:03.231 --> 01:07.168
"Handsome Brother Walks Away."

01:07.268 --> 01:10.571
Hey, Rebel Raptor's
struck again.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.006
Whoever's making these
has really captured

01:13.141 --> 01:15.008
Bradford's stink lines.

01:15.143 --> 01:17.010
- STUDENTS: [laughing]

01:17.145 --> 01:20.148
- Stop laughing!

01:20.214 --> 01:22.150
I am sick of these posters.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.152
This has been going
on for weeks.

01:24.185 --> 01:28.021
What? Oh! You!

01:28.156 --> 01:29.390
- Hey, hey, before
you accuse me,

01:29.490 --> 01:31.792
I want you to know I did not
do this, all right?

01:31.892 --> 01:33.161
I was home all night.

01:33.227 --> 01:36.997
Ask Phoebe.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.367
- Hello, High School
Janitors of America,

01:39.467 --> 01:43.271
um, can I please speak to
your scraped gum division?

01:43.371 --> 01:45.906
- Max in the house!

01:46.006 --> 01:47.841
- Quiet, Max.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.179
Sorry, that was my brother.
He is dumb as a board.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.646
It's true, Principal Bradford.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.682
Max was home all night while
I worked on my article

01:54.782 --> 01:56.784
on gum chewing habits
in a typical suburban--

01:56.884 --> 01:59.553
- Don't care!

01:59.653 --> 02:01.789
When I catch this Rebel Raptor,
they're gonna get

02:01.889 --> 02:04.525
the worst punishment
this school has to offer.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.328
- What? Being principal
for a day?

02:07.428 --> 02:09.230
- They're gonna spend
the rest of high school

02:09.330 --> 02:13.567
workin' the lunch line!

02:13.667 --> 02:16.003
- Max, the Rebel Raptor.
That's it.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.371
It's the perfect article.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.072
If I can find out who he is,

02:19.207 --> 02:20.508
it'll get me the cover
and the "A".

02:20.608 --> 02:24.111
- And I'd better not see another
one of these posters of me!

02:24.212 --> 02:26.980
- STUDENTS: [laughing]

02:27.080 --> 02:29.217
- *

02:29.317 --> 02:30.484
* What you see

02:30.584 --> 02:32.220
* Is not what you get

02:32.286 --> 02:35.289
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:35.389 --> 02:37.024
* We fit right in

02:37.124 --> 02:38.492
* Bet you never guessed

02:38.592 --> 02:40.027
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:40.127 --> 02:41.595
* Just like all the rest

02:41.695 --> 02:43.397
* A picture
perfect family *

02:43.497 --> 02:45.499
* Is what we try to be

02:45.599 --> 02:46.867
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:46.967 --> 02:48.502
* The crazy things we do

02:48.602 --> 02:50.238
* This isn't
make believe *

02:50.271 --> 02:51.939
* It's our reality

02:52.039 --> 02:53.374
* Just your average family

02:53.474 --> 02:56.444
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:56.544 --> 03:00.381
* Livin' a double life

03:03.651 --> 03:05.386
- How is your Rebel Raptor
search going?

03:05.486 --> 03:06.854
- Great. I made a list of
everyone at school

03:06.954 --> 03:08.622
with the skills to pull
off these stunts

03:08.722 --> 03:09.957
and summoned them here.

03:10.057 --> 03:15.095
- Hm, and he's the only
one who showed up?

03:15.263 --> 03:17.498
- Yep.

03:17.598 --> 03:21.001
- So this isn't a date?

03:21.101 --> 03:22.303
- No.

03:22.403 --> 03:25.406
- Can it be?
- No!

03:25.506 --> 03:27.275
- Your loss, baby.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.976
- Phoebe, I don't know how

03:29.076 --> 03:31.178
you're gonna find out
who this guy is.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.746
You should just give up.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.682
- You don't get "A"'s
by giving up, Max.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.617
You have to work hard.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.019
I mean, pffft, it's not
like the Rebel Raptor

03:39.119 --> 03:41.054
is gonna contact me.
- [text tone chimes]

03:41.154 --> 03:44.325
- It's a message
from the Rebel Raptor!

03:44.425 --> 03:47.661
All my hard work
finally paid off.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.062
- You didn't do anything.

03:49.162 --> 03:54.635
- Um, I don't have the time to
explain journalism to you.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.637
Wait, it says he wants to
do an interview with me

03:56.737 --> 03:58.539
to tell his story,

03:58.639 --> 04:00.674
but only if I keep
his identity a secret.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.443
Pffft, it's a deal.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.877
- Would chocolates
change your mind?

04:03.977 --> 04:07.681
- No!

04:07.781 --> 04:10.150
- Is your mom home?
- Get out!

04:12.320 --> 04:16.490
- *

04:16.590 --> 04:18.626
- MAN ON VIDEO: Aliens
are everywhere.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.395
They could be in your city,
your neighborhood,

04:21.495 --> 04:23.597
or even sitting
right next to you.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.733
- [dramatic music]

04:25.833 --> 04:28.802
- BOTH: Ahhhhhh!

04:28.902 --> 04:30.438
- What's going on?

04:30.538 --> 04:31.839
- Billy's an alien!

04:31.939 --> 04:34.342
- That's what an alien
would say!

04:34.375 --> 04:37.411
- Okay, I told you guys
to stop watching these videos.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.112
There's no such thing
as aliens.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.882
- Aw, it's just a little
harmless fun, Barb.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.817
What's the worst
that can happen?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.453
- Show your face, alien!

04:45.553 --> 04:47.421
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Okay! Okay!

04:47.521 --> 04:48.756
Guys, your mom is right.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.924
There's no such
thing as aliens.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.960
But have you ever heard
of the chubacabra?

04:53.060 --> 04:56.430
- Hank!

04:56.530 --> 05:00.368
Now no more ripping each other's
faces off, you got it?

05:00.401 --> 05:03.504
- [screeches like "alien"]

05:03.604 --> 05:05.906
- Okay, maybe you're
not an alien,

05:06.006 --> 05:07.207
but do you know who is?

05:07.375 --> 05:10.110
That weird guy who sells
pretzels at the mall.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.412
- It's so true.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.581
Let's see what he's
hiding under that paper hat.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.650
[zooming]

05:16.750 --> 05:19.186
Hair. He was hiding hair.

05:22.022 --> 05:25.859
- [whimsical suspenseful music]

05:28.796 --> 05:30.998
- Rebel Raptor, I'm alone,
like you asked.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.000
- [electronic voice]
Why are you dressed

05:33.100 --> 05:34.968
like a black and white movie?

05:35.068 --> 05:37.838
- I'm a hard-hitting reporter
with a nose for news.

05:37.938 --> 05:42.009
- You're in a journalism
class taught by the gym teacher.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.244
- Now, tell me, how did
you come up with your name--

05:44.412 --> 05:45.813
Rebel Raptor?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.815
- There are certain
things about my legend

05:47.915 --> 05:50.183
that must remain
shrouded in mystery.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.820
- WOMAN: Why is it
so dark in here?

05:52.920 --> 05:57.425
- Mom, you totally ruined
my shrouded mystery!

05:57.525 --> 05:58.592
- BARB: Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.628
Who are you talking to?

06:00.728 --> 06:02.896
Oh, hey, Phoebe.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.733
Why are you dressed
like a black and white movie?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.568
- You're the Rebel Raptor?

06:07.668 --> 06:09.437
How are you
the Rebel Raptor?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.605
You were home every night.
I saw you.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.574
- Did you really see
me, though?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.878
- Hello, High School
Janitors of America,

06:17.978 --> 06:23.350
um, can I please speak to
your scraped gum division?

06:23.451 --> 06:26.454
- Max in the house!

06:26.487 --> 06:28.321
- Quiet, Max.

06:28.456 --> 06:32.092
Sorry, that was my brother.
He is dumb as a board.

06:33.326 --> 06:36.464
- [cut-out thudding]
- COLOSSO: [laughing]

06:36.564 --> 06:38.065
[laughing]

06:38.165 --> 06:40.834
He's not the only dummy!
[laughing]

06:40.934 --> 06:44.938
- Come on, Max, there's no way
that could have really happened.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.040
- COLOSSO: [laughing]

06:47.140 --> 06:50.711
It's too easy!
[laughing]

06:50.811 --> 06:52.345
- Ah!

06:52.480 --> 06:55.749
- Phoebe, you cannot tell
anyone I'm the Rebel Raptor.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.050
Bradford'll make me
work the cafeteria

06:57.150 --> 06:58.852
and wear a hair net.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.655
You can't cage this mane!

07:01.755 --> 07:02.890
- All right, relax, Max.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.124
I--I gave you my word

07:04.224 --> 07:06.359
and superheroes
always keep their word.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.628
- Thank you.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.997
- But I also want that "A".
- Oh, here's the catch.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.032
- You're gonna give me
an exclusive photo

07:12.132 --> 07:14.001
with the Rebel Raptor before
his next poster goes up.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.903
- And you'll blur my face?

07:16.003 --> 07:17.905
- I do that with
all your photos.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.339
- All right, I'll do it.

07:19.507 --> 07:23.744
- Great!
Now, first question...

07:26.580 --> 07:28.882
- Max!
[sighing]

07:28.982 --> 07:31.218
- Be right down.
Just getting a sandwich.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.623
- Do you see any aliens yet?

07:35.723 --> 07:39.993
- Ah! Flying saucer
shaped like the moon!

07:40.093 --> 07:43.964
- That is the moon,
Gali-lamo.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.133
- At least I'm
trying to find aliens.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.802
All you did was make
tuna casserole.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.704
- That's alien bait.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.339
They like human brains,

07:52.439 --> 07:54.542
so I made some from noodles
and white cat food.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.077
- [food splatting]

07:57.177 --> 08:01.314
- Ew, noodles!

08:01.414 --> 08:05.553
- [screechy singing]

08:05.653 --> 08:07.154
- What was that?

08:07.254 --> 08:09.089
- That's the noodles talkin'.

08:09.189 --> 08:13.093
- [screechy singing
continues]

08:13.193 --> 08:15.228
- It's coming from
Mrs. Wong's house.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.898
- [screechy singing
continues]

08:23.971 --> 08:25.706
Huh?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.309
Huh!
[growling]

08:31.579 --> 08:34.447
- Mrs. Wong's an alien
and she saw us.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.884
Run!
- BILLY: [zooming]

08:36.984 --> 08:39.620
- Why did I get
the laser eyes?

08:41.154 --> 08:43.456
- I'm telling you--
we saw an alien.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.994
- Uh-huh. Whose hair
did you rip out this time?

08:47.094 --> 08:49.262
- We were wrong
about Pretzel Pete.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.798
But we're right
about Mrs. Wong.

08:50.898 --> 08:54.034
- Just because she's completely
void of human emotion

08:54.134 --> 08:55.969
doesn't make her an alien.

08:56.069 --> 09:00.941
- But she has a huge
bug head--like...

09:01.041 --> 09:02.509
- Okay, now you're
just being mean.

09:02.610 --> 09:05.312
No more alien talk
and that's final.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.615
- Now, I'm gonna go have
more of that delicious

09:07.715 --> 09:11.084
tuna noodle casserole
your mom made.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.921
- I didn't make
a tuna noodle casserole.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.894
- Hey, did you get
the cover story?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.963
- Yep, and the "A".

09:23.063 --> 09:24.164
This is so great.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.866
- No, I'm so great.

09:25.966 --> 09:30.470
Check it out.
Less attractive copy cats.

09:30.638 --> 09:34.107
Ah, I remember my first
act of vandalism.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.143
- Phoebe, your article
was amazing.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.011
The Raptor's such a bad boy.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.747
Was he cute?

09:43.383 --> 09:45.185
- He certainly thinks so.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.754
- Well, you can give
us all the deets

09:46.854 --> 09:48.455
when you sit with us
at lunch today.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.458
- Definitely.
See ya soon.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.426
This day could not get better.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.062
- Tell me who
the Rebel Raptor is now!

09:55.162 --> 09:57.264
- But it could get worse.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.399
- The name.

09:59.499 --> 10:03.003
- All right, Principal Bradford,
the truth is...

10:03.103 --> 10:04.772
I can't tell you.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.741
- Phoebe, how could you?
Wait! What?

10:07.841 --> 10:11.011
- I promised my source
that I would protect them

10:11.111 --> 10:12.445
and I don't break
my promises.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.381
- [silently]
Thank you.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.116
- Phoebe, I have to say that

10:16.216 --> 10:17.751
I am impressed with
your integrity.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.520
- Really?
- No.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.423
Either you tell me who
the Rebel Raptor is

10:23.523 --> 10:27.127
or I will make you Hiddenville
High's newest lunch lady.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.530
- You're bluffing.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.400
- [elastic snapping]

10:33.500 --> 10:35.635
- Okay, you can
stop bluffing now.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.104
- [laughing]

10:46.046 --> 10:47.815
- [food splatting]
- Next.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.020
Hey, Winnie! Look who's got
the hook up for ya.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.688
Extra--

10:54.788 --> 10:56.456
whatever this is.

10:56.556 --> 10:59.192
- Uh, I was just
gonna have the salad.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.895
- I think this is the salad.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.732
- So, I guess we won't be having
lunch together, Phoebe.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.167
- Well, I mean, unless you guys
wanna come sit over here.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.903
I can flip over
that mop bucket.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.405
Yeah, I just heard myself.
Go enjoy your life.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.545
- I can't believe
I used to go out with you.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.486
- Hey, Phoebe, I just wanna--
- Make fun of me?

11:26.586 --> 11:28.388
Go right ahead.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.390
- No, I'm not here to
make fun of you.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.392
I'm here to thank you
for keeping your word.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.027
And now that I'm
done with that--

11:34.127 --> 11:37.197
what's living on your face?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.099
- It's a mole.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.268
Gladys says you sprout one
the moment you tie on the apron.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.937
- And we are
"Sisters of the Mole."

11:44.037 --> 11:45.906
- [silently]
Help me.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.310
- Gladys!

11:50.410 --> 11:52.179
The students are rebelling.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.949
Look at what they've
done to me.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.117
- Ha! Ha!

11:57.217 --> 11:59.219
You are garbage face!

11:59.319 --> 12:02.622
[cackling laughter]

12:02.790 --> 12:06.093
- Ah. Ready to tell me who
the Rebel Raptor is?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.495
- I'm sorry, Principal Bradford,
I told you I can't.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.063
- Then you get
to keep your job.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.800
- Now make me 500 hot dogs
by the end of the day.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.802
- What? But I'll
miss fifth period.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.004
- Oh? Oh, is that when
you take history of--

12:17.104 --> 12:18.839
just do what I say!

12:21.108 --> 12:22.509
- That's strange.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.511
Why would Bradford
need 500 hot dogs?

12:24.611 --> 12:26.379
What do you think he's hiding?

12:26.479 --> 12:28.381
- I don't know--
a second stomach?

12:28.481 --> 12:30.383
- No, I mean,
he's up to something.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.385
And if you can figure
out what it is...

12:32.485 --> 12:34.387
- ...then I can use
it against him

12:34.487 --> 12:36.189
and get out of
this cafeteria!

12:36.289 --> 12:38.191
All right, how are we gonna
find out what he's hiding?

12:38.291 --> 12:41.261
- We? You mean you and the mole?
'Cause I'm out.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.863
- What? Seriously?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.697
I'm covering for you
and you're not gonna help me?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.099
- Phoebe, if I helped you,

12:46.199 --> 12:48.635
that would make your
self-sacrifice meaningless

12:48.735 --> 12:51.538
and I can't do that to you.

12:51.638 --> 12:52.873
[chomping apple]

12:52.973 --> 12:55.042
[mouth full of apple]
Good luck.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.580
- If these cool hats don't
protect us from aliens,

13:00.680 --> 13:02.983
at least Thunderman
and Electriss will.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.517
- BARB: All right, kids,
we'll be back soon.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.053
We're going out for a run.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.187
- What?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.590
- That's what I said
when your mom suggested it.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.559
- You guys can't
leave us alone.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.727
- Don't worry, Max is here.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.763
- Thank goodness
we're not totally alone.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.132
- MAX's VOICE:
Max in the house.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.668
- [cut-out thudding]

13:23.603 --> 13:26.273
- HANK: [grunting]
Oh, come on.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.640
- Hello, Thundermans.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.976
Look what I have.

13:29.076 --> 13:32.112
- Oh, Barb, you ordered
a pizza for our run?

13:32.212 --> 13:35.315
[sniffling]
You really get me.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.884
- No, Hank.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.651
Mrs. Wong, what are
you doing here?

13:38.751 --> 13:41.054
- I'm trying a new "Alien"
theme for my restaurant.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.624
This is my
U-F-Oh-so-good pizza.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.360
I came to do a taste test.
- HANK: Mmmmm!

13:47.460 --> 13:48.628
- [slaps hand]
Not you!

13:48.728 --> 13:50.898
You like everything.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.933
- But not everyone.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.402
- I want your kids to tell
me if it tastes delicious--

13:55.502 --> 13:57.938
or like something
you'd cook.

13:58.038 --> 14:02.009
- Hey, my wife made
a great tuna noodle casserole.

14:02.109 --> 14:05.012
- I didn't make a casserole.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.714
Well, go ahead, Mrs. Wong.
Billy and Nora love pizza

14:07.814 --> 14:10.550
and they won't stop
talking about aliens.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.986
- Feel free to
pick their brains.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.555
- Wait, they like aliens?

14:15.655 --> 14:18.425
Then they'll love
my new uniform.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.030
- [door latch clicking]

14:23.130 --> 14:25.398
- There, I've locked every
door in the house.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.934
Now no aliens can get in.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.469
- I'll do it, too,
just to be safe.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.504
[zooming]
- [locks clicking]

14:31.604 --> 14:35.042
- And now they're
double-locked.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.577
- You just unlocked
all the doors I locked.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.312
- [knock at door]

14:39.412 --> 14:42.249
- It's open.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.817
- [spooky music]

14:44.952 --> 14:46.553
- Hello, Earthlings.

14:46.653 --> 14:51.724
Get ready for a close encounter
of the "Wong" kind.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.327
- BOTH: Ahhhhhh!

14:59.232 --> 15:02.102
- [heavy thud]
- [groaning]

15:09.109 --> 15:11.544
Good thing nobody
saw that.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.046
- Oh, I saw that.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.082
- Phoebe, what are
you doing in here?

15:15.182 --> 15:17.084
- Well, I snuck back
in so I could

15:17.184 --> 15:19.286
follow those hot dogs and see
what Bradford is up to and--

15:19.386 --> 15:20.887
wait a minute!

15:20.988 --> 15:22.689
Did you sneak into
school to help me?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.424
- What? No, I'm not
helping you.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.793
The Rebel Raptor snuck in
to get dirt on Bradford

15:26.893 --> 15:28.028
for his latest poster.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.429
Totally different.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.298
- Yeah, right. You came
here to help me.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.366
You act like you're--
- Shhhh!

15:33.466 --> 15:35.202
Someone's coming.

15:40.707 --> 15:41.774
That's not Bradford.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.843
But he's our lead
in finding his secret.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.179
Come on!

15:47.714 --> 15:49.616
- All right, get
ready to see--

15:49.716 --> 15:52.119
good grief, what
am I looking at?

15:52.219 --> 15:56.756
- CROWD: [shouting
encouragement]

15:56.856 --> 16:01.361
- YELLOW MAN: [squawking]

16:01.461 --> 16:03.030
- The champion has
the challenger

16:03.063 --> 16:05.298
locked in the dreaded
"pinky swear."

16:05.398 --> 16:06.933
- YELLOW MAN: [squawking]

16:07.034 --> 16:09.902
- [heavy thud]
- CROWD: Oh!

16:10.037 --> 16:11.238
Oh!

16:11.338 --> 16:13.306
- One...two...
- YELLOW MAN: [squawking]

16:13.406 --> 16:15.108
- MODERATOR: ...three!
- [bell ringing]

16:15.208 --> 16:20.180
- CROWD: [cheering]

16:20.280 --> 16:21.348
- YELLOW MAN: [screaming]

16:21.448 --> 16:24.084
- The winner and reigning
champion,

16:24.184 --> 16:26.786
the Duke of Detention,

16:26.886 --> 16:30.190
the Sultan of Suspension.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.791
- Does Bradford know there's
an illegal wrestling club

16:31.891 --> 16:33.593
in the school at night?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.262
- Principal Pain!

16:35.362 --> 16:39.932
- [laughing]
- CROWD: [cheering]

16:40.067 --> 16:42.935
- PHOEBE: I'm guessing yes.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.771
- Bradford is a wrestler?

16:44.871 --> 16:49.742
His life outside the school
is inside the school.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.179
That is so sad.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.980
- Yeah, but a picture of
Bradford holding

16:54.081 --> 16:56.083
an underground wrestling match

16:56.149 --> 16:58.285
will get me off
lunch lady lane.

16:58.385 --> 17:01.254
Oh, I've gotta get
that mask off.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.124
[powers zapping]

17:04.224 --> 17:06.426
Great, it's stuck
on his fat head.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.128
How am I gonna get it off?

17:08.228 --> 17:10.497
- You're not.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.900
I am.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.535
When I beat him in the ring.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.270
- Aha! I knew you
were here to help me.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.506
- Okay, fine.
I'm here to help you.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.142
You stood up for me.
Kept my secret.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.310
I owe ya one.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.712
Now slap me!
- What? To get you psyched?

17:25.812 --> 17:27.480
- No, for helping you.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.350
- [sharp slap]
- Oh! Thanks.

17:30.450 --> 17:34.321
Now it's time to
body slam Bradford.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.323
- You realize
that's a jock strap.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.325
- [yelping]
Ughhh!

17:38.425 --> 17:40.660
- [spooky "alien" music]

17:40.760 --> 17:42.729
- Where are you,
my little test subjects?

17:42.829 --> 17:46.299
Get out here so I can
pick your brains.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.737
- Nora, I'm gonna jump out.

17:50.837 --> 17:54.207
While Wong picks my brain,
you go save yourself.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.575
- That's nice of you, Billy,

17:55.675 --> 17:59.846
but I don't think your brain's
gonna buy me much time.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.781
- So, what are we gonna do?

18:01.881 --> 18:03.316
- Remember who we are.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.751
- Terrified children--

18:04.851 --> 18:07.720
who may have soiled
their underwear?

18:07.820 --> 18:10.490
- No, superheroes.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.359
I'll distract the Wong

18:12.459 --> 18:14.361
while you super-speed
tie her up.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.363
- Come on, kiddies, I've got
something for you

18:16.463 --> 18:18.298
that's out of this world.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.733
- Die, space creep!

18:20.833 --> 18:23.670
- Ah!

18:23.770 --> 18:26.306
Ah! I can't see!

18:26.406 --> 18:28.875
- BILLY: [zooming]

18:28.975 --> 18:31.178
Finish her, Nora.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.912
- [powers zapping]
- Kids, stop!

18:33.012 --> 18:34.881
What are you doing?

18:34.981 --> 18:37.750
- Mrs. Wong's a creepy alien
and tried to pick our brains!

18:37.850 --> 18:39.952
So, ET is about
to go to the ER!

18:40.052 --> 18:41.588
- BARB: No!

18:41.688 --> 18:43.490
Mrs. Wong is not an alien.

18:43.590 --> 18:47.026
She was just thinking of having
an alien-themed restaurant.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.596
Apparently, with costumes.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.499
- She just wanted you kids
to try her new pizza.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.201
- Not any more, jerks!

18:54.301 --> 18:56.203
You kids are crazy!

18:56.269 --> 18:59.539
And your breath
smells like cat food.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.275
- You put cat food
in your casserole?

19:02.375 --> 19:05.111
- I didn't make a casserole!

19:05.212 --> 19:08.581
- But, wait, we heard alien
noises coming from your house.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.217
- What alien noises?

19:10.317 --> 19:11.551
The only sound coming
from my house

19:11.651 --> 19:13.920
is my beautiful singing.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.923
- [screechy singing]
- Finish her, Nora!

19:17.023 --> 19:19.125
- [powers zapping]
- BARB: [covering Nora's eyes]

19:19.226 --> 19:21.093
- [screechy singing
continues]

19:22.595 --> 19:25.265
- All right, which one
of you is loco enough

19:25.365 --> 19:28.835
to take on Principal Pain?

19:28.935 --> 19:31.404
- I'm so ready!

19:31.504 --> 19:33.706
Get ready, old man,
'cause you're about to be--

19:33.806 --> 19:37.009
- BRADFORD: [roaring]
- MAX: [screaming]

19:37.109 --> 19:38.645
- BOTH: [grunting]

19:38.745 --> 19:40.980
- [heavy thud]
- MAX: Whoa!

19:41.080 --> 19:43.283
- MODERATOR: Ooh, the champion
is taking the challenger

19:43.383 --> 19:45.685
to pretzel town.

19:45.785 --> 19:49.088
- All right, Principal Pain,
time for a little payback.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.323
[powers zapping]

19:50.423 --> 19:51.758
- BRADFORD: [screaming]

19:51.858 --> 19:55.562
- It looks like this challenger
has some fight in him.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.863
- [powers zapping]

19:56.963 --> 19:59.432
- MODERATOR: Look at
this high-flyer.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.967
I haven't seen moves like this

20:01.067 --> 20:05.372
since The Flying Squirrel
fought Andrew Craig.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.573
- Get ready,
you big-headed goon,

20:06.673 --> 20:10.076
'cause this is gonna hurt.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.144
Hey! Hey, I can't see!

20:12.245 --> 20:13.680
Down in front!
down in front!

20:13.780 --> 20:14.947
- MAX: Oh!
- [heavy thud]

20:15.047 --> 20:17.116
- Uh-oh, looks like
Principal Pain's gonna

20:17.216 --> 20:19.986
send him to the school nurse.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.521
- Nice try, pal.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.923
But you're about to
be expelled!

20:24.023 --> 20:25.292
- MAX: [screaming]

20:25.392 --> 20:27.960
- And the challenger
is down!

20:28.060 --> 20:31.197
One...two...

20:31.298 --> 20:33.065
- Not so fast!

20:33.165 --> 20:35.968
- MODERATOR: Another mystery
wrestler has entered the ring.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.070
Looks like this
challenger's a tag team.

20:38.170 --> 20:42.108
If there were rules,
this would be illegal.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.644
- Thanks. Ready to do this?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.879
- PHOEBE & MAX: [roaring]

20:50.417 --> 20:54.186
- Okay, I'm really surprised
at how good he is at this.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.155
- MODERATOR: Principal Pain
is outside the ring

20:56.255 --> 20:57.857
looking for something.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.726
- What's he looking for?
What's he looking for?

20:59.826 --> 21:03.195
- He's found it--
The "Board" of Education.

21:03.330 --> 21:06.032
- Okay, there really
should be some rules.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.336
- CROWD: [shouting
encouragement]

21:09.436 --> 21:10.970
- [roaring]

21:11.070 --> 21:13.340
- [powers zapping]
- [hot dog wiener zooming]

21:13.373 --> 21:15.207
- Oh!

21:15.342 --> 21:17.777
Oh, my back.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.480
- MODERATOR: One...two...

21:20.580 --> 21:23.750
three!
- [bell ringing]

21:23.850 --> 21:28.888
- CROWD: [cheering]

21:28.988 --> 21:30.757
- That was the most
electrifying match

21:30.857 --> 21:32.892
in underground school
wrestling history.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.127
Who are our new champions?

21:35.227 --> 21:37.630
- I am the Rebel Raptor!

21:37.730 --> 21:39.599
- I knew it!

21:39.699 --> 21:41.601
- And I...

21:41.701 --> 21:44.937
Am the Lunchador!

21:45.037 --> 21:46.406
- Oh! Oh!

21:46.506 --> 21:47.974
- Take me off the lunch line

21:48.074 --> 21:51.210
or I'll send this picture
to the real Board of Education.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.380
- [growling] Fine!

21:53.480 --> 21:57.384
Man, I hate your family!

21:57.417 --> 22:01.053
- Wow. So who gets
to keep the championship belt?

22:01.153 --> 22:03.255
- Uh, I do 'cause I helped
you and saved your butt.

22:03.390 --> 22:06.893
- What are you talking about?
I saved your butt.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.261
- No, I want this.
- Gimme it.
