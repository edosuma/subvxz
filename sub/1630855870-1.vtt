00:16.085 --> 00:19.285
<i>That's one small step for man.</i>

01:02.365 --> 01:03.995
<i>Have you ever looked around</i>

01:03.995 --> 01:07.165
<i>and wondered,
where's all this from?</i>

01:07.165 --> 01:11.675
<i>All the stars,
planets, houses, trees,</i>

01:11.675 --> 01:14.345
<i>like, what is all this shit?</i>

01:14.345 --> 01:16.875
<i>Want to know something crazy?</i>

01:16.875 --> 01:19.685
<i>Time is an illusion.</i>

01:19.685 --> 01:22.685
<i>Physicists say that the
past, present, and future all</i>

01:22.685 --> 01:24.285
<i>exist at the exact same moment.</i>

01:24.285 --> 01:27.125
<i>Like, every possible thing
that could ever occur</i>

01:27.125 --> 01:30.025
<i>is occurring all at once.</i>

01:30.025 --> 01:32.225
<i>So yeah, I guess
I'm going to try</i>

01:32.225 --> 01:34.265
<i>to explain the unexplainable.</i>

01:36.165 --> 01:38.335
<i>Well, it all starts with
me and a couple of friends</i>

01:38.335 --> 01:41.035
<i>fucking around with
the paranormal.</i>

01:41.035 --> 01:43.705
<i>Let's go back to the beginning--</i>

01:43.705 --> 01:45.375
<i>or is it the end?</i>

01:57.855 --> 01:59.685
<i>Are you paying attention?</i>

02:03.395 --> 02:06.025
My worst trip was probably
when I took three hits of acid

02:06.025 --> 02:07.595
before my brother's birth.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.665
What?

02:08.665 --> 02:09.765
Yeah.

02:09.765 --> 02:11.265
What do you mean
you took three hits of acid?

02:11.265 --> 02:13.505
Nobody takes three
hits of acid, dumbass.

02:13.505 --> 02:15.675
What I'm saying
is I agree with you.

02:15.675 --> 02:16.905
Nobody should do that.

02:16.905 --> 02:18.405
I'm ashamed of myself.

02:18.405 --> 02:22.845
It looked like my mom's body
had an entirely other mouth,

02:22.845 --> 02:25.045
except this one had a mustache.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.715
It was eating babies.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.085
Oh, shit.

02:29.085 --> 02:30.315
You all right?

02:37.225 --> 02:40.565
You know, Dallas, that's
actually a story for your aunt

02:40.565 --> 02:42.235
over at <i>The Times.</i>

02:42.235 --> 02:43.865
Print that shit, we all win.

02:43.865 --> 02:47.205
True, you should
get a police sketch
artist to illustrate the crime.

02:47.205 --> 02:49.375
What? Illustrate
your mom's vagina?

02:49.375 --> 02:50.635
What the fuck's wrong with you?

02:50.635 --> 02:52.105
Hey, art is art.

03:05.955 --> 03:08.225
Let's do this.

03:20.465 --> 03:21.505
Toe.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.405
3 and 1.

03:26.405 --> 03:27.475
Pull.

03:28.745 --> 03:29.845
One more.

03:31.785 --> 03:33.085
Go.

03:33.085 --> 03:34.915
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.475
Ow, Jesus!

04:00.475 --> 04:01.545
Toe!

04:03.475 --> 04:04.845
Ow!

04:04.845 --> 04:05.885
Put that down.

04:14.895 --> 04:16.655
You guys hear something?

04:24.035 --> 04:25.265
There it is again.

04:27.505 --> 04:29.505
Shit.

04:29.505 --> 04:31.205
Here. Can you tell him
to say it again?

04:31.205 --> 04:32.645
I wasn't recording.

04:32.645 --> 04:33.645
Tell who to say it again?

04:33.645 --> 04:35.205
It's not a fucking
sex phone operator.

04:35.205 --> 04:36.815
It wasn't on!
Make them do it again.

04:36.815 --> 04:39.885
Yo, if you shitheads are going
to be summoning demons again,

04:39.885 --> 04:42.485
make sure you do
it nice this time.

04:42.485 --> 04:45.255
Ask with peace,
and love, and shit.

04:48.185 --> 04:50.825
Hey, did you guys see that?

04:50.825 --> 04:51.825
See what?

04:51.825 --> 04:54.935
I swear that fucking
lamp moved by itself.

04:54.935 --> 04:56.035
Fuck!

04:56.035 --> 04:57.095
Oh, God!

04:57.095 --> 04:59.165
This place is haunted as fuck.

04:59.165 --> 05:01.105
Oh, I hate you guys.

05:01.105 --> 05:04.035
Dallas, why are you so
into this shit anyways?

05:04.035 --> 05:06.775
Why do you make us do all this
paranormal shit all the time?

05:06.775 --> 05:09.015
Proving the unprovable, pussy.

05:09.015 --> 05:10.515
Well, that's
just great, Dallas.

05:10.515 --> 05:13.685
Your mom is going to
love that we did this.

05:13.685 --> 05:16.885
She's going to tell Jesus,
and then you are fucked.

05:16.885 --> 05:19.355
Jesus already
hates me brother.

05:19.355 --> 05:22.595
Look, most of the paranormal
locations in my dad's notebook

05:22.595 --> 05:24.525
are scattered all
over the world.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.865
This is like the only one
we could actually get to.

05:27.865 --> 05:28.865
So let's get serious.

05:28.865 --> 05:31.035
Yeah. Well, we've been
here like three times

05:31.035 --> 05:34.035
over the past couple of years,
and nothing's ever happened.

05:34.035 --> 05:35.105
So.

05:35.105 --> 05:36.305
That lamp just
fucking happened.

05:36.305 --> 05:39.045
Yes, Riley, it
fucking scared me.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.255
Dallas. It said Dallas.

05:59.925 --> 06:04.835
Uh, sir?

06:10.105 --> 06:12.545
What do you desire with Dallas?

06:14.845 --> 06:16.845
Do you wish to kill him?

06:16.845 --> 06:18.145
What the fuck, Riley?

06:18.145 --> 06:19.515
Why did you say that?

06:19.515 --> 06:21.915
I don't know. I never talked
to a fucking ghost before.

06:21.915 --> 06:22.955
Fuck, fuck.

06:22.955 --> 06:24.015
What are we doing?

06:24.015 --> 06:26.685
We're all going to die.

06:26.685 --> 06:27.825
Okay.

06:27.825 --> 06:31.465
According to my
calculations, the camera

06:31.465 --> 06:34.095
should go off right when that
bag flies near the ghost.

06:34.095 --> 06:35.495
Bag's up.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.835
You really think that fucking
bag is going to do anything?

06:37.835 --> 06:41.175
After all this bullshit,
it better do something.

06:41.175 --> 06:42.275
Riley.

06:42.275 --> 06:44.275
If we get this
ghost angry enough,

06:44.275 --> 06:46.505
it may take a physical form.

06:46.505 --> 06:49.545
You know, like when people
get shoved, and scratched,

06:49.545 --> 06:52.785
and shit like that by ghosts, it
has to be physical to do that,

06:52.785 --> 06:53.785
right?

06:53.785 --> 06:56.985
So if we light that bag
up with 10,000 volts

06:56.985 --> 07:00.355
of electromagnetic energy,
and then we swing it

07:00.355 --> 07:04.965
at the exact same moment it
tries to interact with us,

07:04.965 --> 07:07.665
we may be able to see more
of its physical shape--

07:07.665 --> 07:09.995
maybe even enough for
a fucking picture.

07:09.995 --> 07:11.065
All right?

07:11.065 --> 07:12.405
So suck my dick.

07:12.405 --> 07:13.465
Let's get started.

07:13.465 --> 07:14.835
I will not suck your dick.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.975
There's absolutely
no reason to do that.

07:16.975 --> 07:18.775
Dallas, ready?

07:20.245 --> 07:21.315
I think so.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.445
Time to piss this bastard off.

07:30.585 --> 07:35.325
Yo, Lucifer, you here?

07:35.325 --> 07:38.995
We know all about
you, cock dick.

07:38.995 --> 07:41.895
You got hanged right in this
fucking room, didn't you?

07:48.035 --> 07:49.505
That's it.

07:49.505 --> 07:51.745
That's it, you demon prick.

07:51.745 --> 07:53.445
You perv.

07:53.445 --> 07:55.275
Why don't you show yourself?

07:55.275 --> 07:58.015
How about showing
all of yourself?

07:58.015 --> 08:00.015
Riley, what the fuck's
the matter with you?

08:00.015 --> 08:01.185
You sound all horny and shit?

08:01.185 --> 08:03.285
Hey, demon!

08:03.285 --> 08:05.625
Is that your name?

08:05.625 --> 08:11.125
Or should I say Mr. Asshole!

08:21.975 --> 08:23.205
Ho, ho.

08:23.205 --> 08:24.705
Sick, man.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.745
And I'm not even that
stoned, but I straight

08:27.745 --> 08:28.975
up thought I was going to die.

08:28.975 --> 08:32.085
And I'm not even hard--
well, maybe I am hard.

08:32.085 --> 08:33.215
Maybe one of you--

08:33.215 --> 08:34.545
I'm always hard when
I fear for my life.

08:34.545 --> 08:35.585
It's just instinct.

08:35.585 --> 08:37.715
My heart's fucking racing.

08:37.715 --> 08:40.225
I can't even lie, that
scared the shit out of me.

08:40.225 --> 08:41.995
That was dope, dudes.

08:41.995 --> 08:44.895
We just made a mad breakthrough.

08:44.895 --> 08:46.725
We should really be
proud of ourselves.

08:46.725 --> 08:47.765
Oh, fuck!

08:49.835 --> 08:51.065
Holy shit.

08:51.065 --> 08:52.565
Toe, get the camera!

08:52.565 --> 08:54.905
Fuck. What the fuck?

09:04.115 --> 09:05.785
Why is this happening to me?

09:08.155 --> 09:09.185
Go get it!

09:09.185 --> 09:10.425
No, you get it, asshole!

09:10.425 --> 09:11.985
I'm not going to get it!
You're closer.

09:13.155 --> 09:14.455
The bag.

09:15.855 --> 09:18.425
Why ghosts?

09:18.425 --> 09:20.025
Why can't we just be like
a normal group of kids?

09:21.125 --> 09:22.635
Who tied this fucking knot?

09:22.635 --> 09:24.095
What's going on?

09:24.095 --> 09:26.435
I'm trying to get it on!

09:26.435 --> 09:29.375
I just want to get high,
have sex, like normal--

09:29.375 --> 09:30.505
everyone else is having sex.

09:30.505 --> 09:31.605
Turn it on!

09:31.605 --> 09:32.775
It's not working.

09:32.775 --> 09:34.105
What do you
mean it's not working?

09:34.105 --> 09:35.275
It's not fucking working!

09:35.275 --> 09:36.675
Well, make it work!

09:36.675 --> 09:38.285
Why are we fucking
hunting ghosts?

09:38.285 --> 09:39.645
This is so fucked!

09:41.015 --> 09:42.515
Come on!

09:50.295 --> 09:51.695
Are you
trying to blind me?

09:51.695 --> 09:53.225
And why is it so hot?

09:53.225 --> 09:54.665
My friends need me.

09:56.995 --> 09:58.135
It's cool.

09:58.135 --> 09:59.165
Oh, shit!

09:59.165 --> 10:00.235
- Dude.
- It's ready! It's ready!

10:00.235 --> 10:01.305
Ready! What do I do?

10:01.305 --> 10:03.075
Ow, shit! Shit!

10:05.805 --> 10:06.945
Fuck!

10:09.215 --> 10:10.845
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

10:10.845 --> 10:12.315
I'm coming!

10:19.485 --> 10:21.025
Oh shit!

10:23.625 --> 10:24.995
It's over here!

10:34.365 --> 10:35.505
It's in my clothes!

10:35.505 --> 10:36.675
Get the camera!

10:36.675 --> 10:38.075
Get the camera!

11:02.465 --> 11:04.195
<i>That night,
we started something</i>

11:04.195 --> 11:05.305
<i>that couldn't be stopped.</i>

11:07.065 --> 11:09.375
<i>Three best friends about
to find out something</i>

11:09.375 --> 11:11.905
<i>we thought impossible--</i>

11:11.905 --> 11:12.945
<i>answers.</i>

11:30.325 --> 11:31.325
You in the military?

11:33.325 --> 11:34.325
Got a gun?

11:36.865 --> 11:38.965
Why don't they give you a gun?

11:38.965 --> 11:41.335
Hey, they won't give
this loser a gun.

11:54.285 --> 11:55.085
Dammit.

11:55.085 --> 11:57.185
Hey, kid, keep
your feet straight.

12:03.725 --> 12:05.165
I got you a little something.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.365
Dallas, come
help set the table.

12:09.365 --> 12:10.665
One second.

12:12.235 --> 12:13.805
Honey, look who's here.

12:14.975 --> 12:16.975
Hey, Dallas.
How you doing, kid?

12:16.975 --> 12:19.305
Hey, Uncle Jim.
Good to see you.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.375
Good to see you too.

12:21.815 --> 12:23.545
How was your
night with the boys?

12:23.545 --> 12:24.815
It was good.

12:26.485 --> 12:28.685
Meg, I need my laptop.
Are you kidding?

12:28.685 --> 12:30.525
Move your shit.
We're eating dinner.

12:30.525 --> 12:32.685
Don't use
those words, please.

12:32.685 --> 12:33.885
Chaos as usual?

12:33.885 --> 12:36.195
Yeah. Would you like to
join us for dinner?

12:36.195 --> 12:37.625
Yeah, Jim. Stay.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.025
We haven't seen you in months.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.665
Unfortunately, I
have to get going.

12:41.665 --> 12:43.265
I found some things
of your dad's.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.375
You want me to put
them in the garage?

12:48.375 --> 12:50.475
Yes, that'd be great.

12:50.475 --> 12:52.305
Thank you.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.845
I really appreciate
you coming over, Jim.

12:56.175 --> 12:57.515
How are you doing?

12:57.515 --> 12:59.215
How's everyone holding up?

12:59.215 --> 13:01.315
Okay.

13:01.315 --> 13:04.525
If you need anything--
anything at all-- you call me.

13:04.525 --> 13:06.025
I will.

13:06.025 --> 13:07.055
Thank you.

13:12.195 --> 13:13.365
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:16.135 --> 13:18.565
Hey, Dallas, when
you've been looking

13:18.565 --> 13:19.835
through your dad's
stuff, you ever come

13:19.835 --> 13:22.035
across an old military GPS?

13:22.035 --> 13:24.675
It's like a telephone
with Velcro on it?

13:24.675 --> 13:26.905
No, I haven't seen
anything like that.

13:27.645 --> 13:28.875
Okay.

13:30.075 --> 13:31.685
Well, if you come across
anything like that,

13:31.685 --> 13:33.045
you'll let me know, right?

13:33.045 --> 13:34.085
Yeah, of course.

13:36.085 --> 13:37.425
Good to see you guys.
Take care.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.525
See ya.
Bye.

13:38.525 --> 13:39.725
Bye.

14:06.685 --> 14:08.385
Oh, get your hands
out of that, creep.

14:08.385 --> 14:10.585
Listen, you two, I
want peace in this house

14:10.585 --> 14:11.925
when I'm gone.

14:11.925 --> 14:14.055
Meg, don't forget to take
the trash out before dinner.

14:14.055 --> 14:15.095
Oh, yeah.

14:26.265 --> 14:27.305
Oh, hey.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.435
Uh, you okay?

14:30.475 --> 14:31.775
Keep this closed.

14:36.215 --> 14:37.345
Did you find it?

14:37.345 --> 14:38.445
No.

14:39.515 --> 14:40.515
Let's go.

14:49.955 --> 14:52.125
Mom, what are you
all dressed up for?

14:52.125 --> 14:55.465
Actually, I'm going out
tonight, thank you very much.

14:55.465 --> 14:57.665
With who, moron?

14:57.665 --> 15:00.165
Yes, Myron is
taking me to dinner.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.005
And after a year
of dating, I expect

15:02.005 --> 15:03.335
you to be a bit more kind.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.005
Let's pray.

15:15.555 --> 15:16.785
Okay, fine.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.555
Then I'll pray with
your brother and sister.

15:20.855 --> 15:24.955
You guys, I had the
craziest night last night.

15:24.955 --> 15:26.325
I'm serious.
You got to hear this.

15:26.865 --> 15:28.635
It was unbelievable.

15:28.635 --> 15:29.665
You won't believe it.

15:29.665 --> 15:32.005
We saw a real ghost.

15:32.005 --> 15:34.035
I mean it, and I think
I got it on camera.

15:34.035 --> 15:36.405
It was big-- really big.

15:36.405 --> 15:37.975
It moved like an apparition.

15:37.975 --> 15:39.975
It almost killed Toe!

15:39.975 --> 15:42.975
My God, Dallas, shut
up and leave mom alone.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.815
What? What am I doing?

15:44.815 --> 15:46.185
You're constantly
trying to make

15:46.185 --> 15:48.355
her feel stupid for her
beliefs, and it's super lame.

15:48.355 --> 15:49.985
No, I'm not.

15:49.985 --> 15:51.355
This stuff is gnarly.

15:51.355 --> 15:53.155
And if anyone saw what
we saw last night,

15:53.155 --> 15:55.495
they'd feel pretty
different about things.

15:55.495 --> 15:59.895
Dallas, I want you to
stay away from this stuff.

15:59.895 --> 16:01.935
You've been chasing
it for three years

16:01.935 --> 16:03.165
ever since your dad's accident.

16:03.165 --> 16:05.065
And you know what, I'm
done hearing about it.

16:05.065 --> 16:08.405
Whatever your dad did with Jim
in the program or whatever,

16:08.405 --> 16:09.705
it's over.

16:09.705 --> 16:12.205
It's dark, and I don't want you
having anything to do with it.

16:13.575 --> 16:15.175
God damn it.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.215
Why are you so on edge when
you walk through the door?

16:18.215 --> 16:21.015
But you're out all night
chasing invisible monsters

16:21.015 --> 16:22.885
with your friends, and
then you come at us

16:22.885 --> 16:24.185
like we're the weird ones.

16:24.185 --> 16:26.855
Can we just stop and have
a normal dinner for once?

16:26.855 --> 16:28.355
Invisible monsters.

16:28.355 --> 16:33.095
You believe a man in a toga and
Birkenstocks created Jupiter.

16:33.095 --> 16:34.065
Come on.

16:34.065 --> 16:37.135
Most people on Earth
believe in the Bible.

16:37.135 --> 16:39.905
So I guess we are
the crazy ones,

16:39.905 --> 16:41.875
and you are the sole
enlightened one.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.435
I guess so.

16:43.435 --> 16:44.545
Jesus Christ.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.645
Exactly.

16:45.645 --> 16:47.375
Trillions of
galaxies discovered,

16:47.375 --> 16:51.315
and the creator of your universe
is a handsome white dude

16:51.315 --> 16:54.045
that came to this planet
only a few thousand
years ago mind you?

16:54.045 --> 16:57.585
20 billion years after
the planets were created

16:57.585 --> 16:59.725
and millions of years after
life was already here,

16:59.725 --> 17:01.385
but none of that makes sense.

17:01.385 --> 17:04.255
Dallas, now you're
being blasphemous.

17:05.365 --> 17:07.835
But Dad never would have
thought science was crazy.

17:07.835 --> 17:09.495
Well, Dad is gone.

17:09.495 --> 17:10.565
Isn't he?

17:10.565 --> 17:11.965
And he is not coming back.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.835
And I wish you would just
accept that so we could

17:13.835 --> 17:15.675
all move on with our lives.

17:15.675 --> 17:16.735
Look, I love you.

17:16.735 --> 17:18.305
God loves you.

17:18.305 --> 17:21.175
And that's all
anyone here needs.

17:21.175 --> 17:23.445
You don't even
know what God is.

17:23.445 --> 17:26.985
God could be a sea of
energy for all we know.

17:26.985 --> 17:30.185
I guess we still
disagree on a lot of stuff.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.925
And just because
I'm seeing Myron

17:33.925 --> 17:36.955
doesn't mean that I
don't miss your father.

17:39.065 --> 17:41.535
I miss him every single day.

17:43.965 --> 17:48.305
Damn it, I need to
go clean myself up.

18:02.985 --> 18:04.315
Relax your body.

18:07.555 --> 18:09.355
Inhale for 3 seconds.

18:15.065 --> 18:17.165
And exhale. Sigh it out.

18:17.165 --> 18:19.035
Ah.

18:21.065 --> 18:23.005
Shut the fuck up, Toe.

18:24.005 --> 18:25.075
- Stop.
- You guys.

18:25.075 --> 18:26.705
Shut up, Toe.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.715
Come on, this is important.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.985
Dallas, I'm sorry,
dude, but do you really

18:32.985 --> 18:34.485
think we can contact your dad?

18:34.485 --> 18:37.855
Well, if we do, then I
know he's actually dead.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.025
Come on, guys.

18:39.025 --> 18:40.325
We just did this.

18:40.325 --> 18:43.355
Ghosts contact people all
the time with messages!

18:43.355 --> 18:44.695
Maybe we have to get personal.

18:49.235 --> 18:51.705
You think he's
hiding in the dark?

19:07.045 --> 19:11.115
Dad, if you're
here, let me know.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.625
Dallas.

19:17.225 --> 19:19.395
Come on, Dad.
Just give me a sign.

19:20.395 --> 19:24.195
Hey, man, maybe we should
go skating or something.

19:24.195 --> 19:25.535
Let's get out of here for a bit.

19:25.535 --> 19:26.735
Get off, dude.

19:30.945 --> 19:32.545
Come on, Dad.

19:32.545 --> 19:34.205
You're the one that got
me into all this dumb shit

19:34.205 --> 19:35.445
in the first place.

19:45.925 --> 19:47.485
Why are you so silent now?

19:53.465 --> 19:54.535
Whoa.

19:55.935 --> 19:57.195
What?

20:01.975 --> 20:03.175
What is this?

20:05.275 --> 20:06.775
I've never seen this before.

20:09.775 --> 20:10.845
Oh, my God.

20:10.845 --> 20:12.115
Classified?

20:12.115 --> 20:15.655
Advanced Aerospace Threat
Identification Program.

20:17.985 --> 20:19.425
Holy shit.

20:19.425 --> 20:22.455
You always told me your dad
got you into all this UFO shit,

20:22.455 --> 20:23.555
but--

20:25.325 --> 20:27.325
Is that really
what I think it is?

20:27.325 --> 20:30.095
Hell, I never thought
he was this deep.

20:30.095 --> 20:32.265
Neither did I.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.835
What exactly did your
dad tell you he did?

20:36.475 --> 20:37.705
He said he couldn't tell me.

20:40.245 --> 20:41.645
Let me see this for a second.

20:46.045 --> 20:49.015
Oh, this is what
he was looking for.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.655
Hey, guys, come here.
Check this out.

20:50.655 --> 20:52.525
Myers was just
asking me about this.

20:52.525 --> 20:55.795
It's like, some GPS
device or something.

20:55.795 --> 20:57.795
I guess my dad must have hid it.

20:57.795 --> 20:59.665
I don't know.

20:59.665 --> 21:00.695
I wonder if it works.

21:05.835 --> 21:07.335
What are those numbers?

21:07.335 --> 21:10.635
That's like, software
code or something.

21:10.635 --> 21:12.345
That's
not software code.

21:12.345 --> 21:14.205
These are coordinates.

21:14.205 --> 21:16.075
Just like the ones
in the notebook.

21:19.885 --> 21:21.185
Dallas, Dallas!

21:31.965 --> 21:32.995
Hi, Mrs. Edwards.

21:32.995 --> 21:35.665
What I would do
that body, bro.

21:35.665 --> 21:38.735
I'm sorry, what would
you do to my body, Toe?

21:39.865 --> 21:44.905
Hold you tight, love
on you, protect you--

21:44.905 --> 21:47.405
just be your hero and shit.

21:47.405 --> 21:50.745
Like Kevin Costner
in <i>Dance with Horses.</i>

21:53.245 --> 21:54.855
Bye, Mrs. Edwards.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.885
Bye.

21:56.885 --> 21:57.885
Hi, Mom.

22:41.135 --> 22:42.465
We're having bacon?

22:43.595 --> 22:44.935
Pancakes too.

22:46.005 --> 22:47.565
What's he doing here?

22:47.565 --> 22:48.735
Please, not now.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.405
It's fine.

22:50.405 --> 22:55.345
Listen, Dallas, well,
we're kind of celebrating.

22:55.345 --> 22:57.945
Wait, what are you trying
to throw on me right now?

22:58.885 --> 23:00.815
Dallas, honey, sit down.

23:00.815 --> 23:03.885
We have something we
want to tell everyone.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.725
Myron asked me to marry him.

23:08.285 --> 23:09.955
Oh, my God!

23:15.795 --> 23:17.365
What'd you say?

23:17.905 --> 23:19.265
I said yes.

23:19.265 --> 23:22.435
I love Leah, and she loves me.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.945
Yo, excuse me, Boomer,
but nobody asked you.

23:24.945 --> 23:25.805
Dallas!

23:25.805 --> 23:27.945
You don't even
remember Dad, do you?

23:27.945 --> 23:28.975
You don't talk about him.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.115
You don't mention
his name anymore.

23:30.115 --> 23:31.515
Now this?

23:31.515 --> 23:33.315
What the hell is going on?

23:50.495 --> 23:51.705
Dude.
No, fuck dude.

23:51.705 --> 23:53.505
Dude, you're grabbing
my fucking ass.

23:53.505 --> 23:54.505
Stop.

23:54.505 --> 23:56.205
They detail a classified
UFO research program.

23:56.205 --> 24:00.205
The Starfish Prime Nuke Test,
the 2003 New York blackouts,

24:00.205 --> 24:01.975
the Tall Route
Race from Atlantis,

24:01.975 --> 24:04.315
the grays, they're all real.

24:04.315 --> 24:05.485
Hi honey, how are you?

24:05.485 --> 24:07.485
Oh, honey, it's
great to see you again.

24:07.485 --> 24:09.655
Stop, you're still pinching!

24:09.655 --> 24:12.055
You're like a blind man
treasure hunting for cock.

24:12.055 --> 24:13.155
I'm trying, dude.

24:13.155 --> 24:14.595
Hey Dallas, how does
this work again?

24:14.595 --> 24:16.925
Riley keeps shifting his weight
so my hand touches his dick.

24:16.925 --> 24:18.565
Well, you got to
distract him with something

24:18.565 --> 24:21.395
like a like a soft touch
to the chest or whatever.

24:21.395 --> 24:22.935
A soft touch to the chest?

24:22.935 --> 24:24.165
Or whatever.

24:24.165 --> 24:26.165
Yuck.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.535
One more time.
I'm watching now.

24:28.535 --> 24:29.835
- All right, ready?
- Yeah.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.245
Oh, my granddaughter.

24:31.245 --> 24:32.745
Hello.

24:32.745 --> 24:34.615
You have something
on your shirt.

24:35.415 --> 24:36.945
You keep-- stop!

24:36.945 --> 24:38.015
Just--

24:38.015 --> 24:39.115
What is that?

24:39.115 --> 24:40.785
Like this, asshole.

24:42.455 --> 24:44.115
Just come at me.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.255
All right. What's up, man?

24:45.255 --> 24:46.355
How are you?

24:46.355 --> 24:47.555
Not good.

24:50.895 --> 24:51.995
What?

24:52.895 --> 24:54.425
- Well, give it back.
- You're broke.

24:54.425 --> 24:56.035
How'd you even do that?

24:56.035 --> 24:57.235
YouTube, shitheads.

24:57.235 --> 25:00.035
And a lot of boring days last
summer at the coffee shop.

25:00.035 --> 25:02.035
Do I have your attention now?

25:02.035 --> 25:02.935
No.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.075
Come on, guys.
Look, there's pictures.

25:06.575 --> 25:08.375
Did you know the government
actually retrieved

25:08.375 --> 25:09.775
multiple crashed UFOs?

25:09.775 --> 25:12.145
Yo, Dallas, is
your sister here?

25:12.145 --> 25:13.215
Shut it.

25:13.215 --> 25:14.785
I'm just thinking
out loud here.

25:14.785 --> 25:16.455
We should hang with
her more often.

25:16.455 --> 25:17.755
I like her mind.

25:18.755 --> 25:20.785
Huh? Why-- why
would we do that?

25:22.295 --> 25:26.725
It looks like my dad and Myers
were piloting the program.

25:26.725 --> 25:31.735
It says right here their job
was to pursue, track, and engage

25:31.735 --> 25:33.665
unidentified flying objects.

25:33.665 --> 25:37.105
And a man named Dr. Eric Walker
was their program director.

25:38.445 --> 25:39.605
Let me see that.

25:41.275 --> 25:42.275
Let's see.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.345
All right.

25:43.345 --> 25:47.045
Oh, Dr. Walker.

25:48.055 --> 25:49.185
There's not much here.

25:49.185 --> 25:51.425
It just says that he graduated
from MIT with a doctorate

25:51.425 --> 25:53.955
in theoretical physics.

25:57.125 --> 25:58.595
Holy shit.

25:58.595 --> 26:00.925
Apparently he's been
missing for years.

26:00.925 --> 26:02.265
Oh, my God.

26:02.265 --> 26:03.935
That's amazing.

26:03.935 --> 26:05.465
I know, right?

26:09.075 --> 26:11.135
Do you guys have any
idea what this can mean?

26:12.505 --> 26:14.275
Go ahead, pal.
What's this all mean?

26:14.275 --> 26:15.545
Well, it means
Myers hasn't given

26:15.545 --> 26:16.845
me the full story about my dad.

26:16.845 --> 26:19.715
The government lied,
possibly about everything.

26:21.815 --> 26:23.155
What are you guys looking at?

26:25.085 --> 26:27.385
Nothing, just processing.

26:27.385 --> 26:29.625
Guys, come on.
This is important.

26:29.625 --> 26:30.895
My mom's going to
marry that tool

26:30.895 --> 26:33.165
without even really knowing
what happened to my dad.

26:33.165 --> 26:35.395
Yeah, they might have
lied about your dad's job.

26:35.395 --> 26:37.365
But that doesn't
necessarily mean they

26:37.365 --> 26:38.805
lied about his disappearance.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.065
Dude, disappearing
on the job takes

26:41.065 --> 26:43.675
a whole new meaning
if you hunt advanced

26:43.675 --> 26:45.745
aerial threats for a living.

26:45.745 --> 26:48.345
Either way, I need
the full story--

26:48.345 --> 26:49.675
the real story.

26:51.175 --> 26:54.215
Here, take this device.

26:54.215 --> 26:56.185
The coordinates on it matched
the ones in the notebook,

26:56.185 --> 26:58.585
except these are new ones
we haven't seen before.

26:58.585 --> 27:01.595
Great, more locations
in North Korea or wherever

27:01.595 --> 27:03.655
that we can't get to.

27:03.655 --> 27:06.195
- I'll look into it.
Thank you.

27:06.195 --> 27:08.935
I think I better give
these documents to Jim.

27:08.935 --> 27:11.165
They weren't just co-pilots,
they were best friends.

27:11.165 --> 27:12.705
So he'll help me for sure.

27:18.605 --> 27:20.705
Dude, what are you looking at?

27:23.315 --> 27:24.345
Dude.

27:24.345 --> 27:25.785
Have you gone insane, man?

27:25.785 --> 27:28.085
Why in the hell would I let
you creep on my sister, idiot?

27:28.085 --> 27:29.685
Because you care about us.

27:29.685 --> 27:32.525
Because best friends make
sacrifices for each other.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.185
Fascist.

27:34.185 --> 27:37.525
I just want to look at your
sister naked just for a minute.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.625
Please, can I just look
at your sister naked?

27:41.125 --> 27:43.095
Come on.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.805
I want to see them titties.

27:44.805 --> 27:45.965
No!

27:45.965 --> 27:47.105
Come on.

27:50.275 --> 27:51.775
Toe!

28:02.355 --> 28:04.585
<i>♪ I can't be fallin' again</i>

28:04.585 --> 28:06.885
<i>♪ I am worn a bit thin</i>

28:06.885 --> 28:09.425
<i>♪ I get bored of
the same scenario</i>

28:09.425 --> 28:11.865
<i>♪ A normal shit eating grin</i>

28:26.145 --> 28:28.075
Dallas Edwards.

28:28.075 --> 28:30.115
What's up, sport?
I've never seen you here before.

28:30.115 --> 28:31.345
Hey, Jim.

28:31.345 --> 28:32.815
Thanks for seeing me.

28:33.615 --> 28:34.815
Yeah. Come on.

28:42.525 --> 28:45.865
So Dallas, how can
I help you today?

28:45.865 --> 28:48.795
Actually, I did find a
few things in an old box.

28:49.895 --> 28:53.435
Looks like my dad had them
stashed away for some time.

28:53.435 --> 28:54.535
Wow.

28:54.535 --> 28:56.875
It has been a long
time, hasn't it?

29:00.305 --> 29:02.675
That picture was with
these documents too.

29:06.515 --> 29:08.485
These are classified.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.655
Where did you find these?

29:09.655 --> 29:11.115
So they're real?

29:11.115 --> 29:13.285
You could go to
jail for having this.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.195
According to those documents,
almost everything we've been

29:16.195 --> 29:18.295
told about my dad is a lie.

29:18.295 --> 29:23.335
So I'm wondering, has the
story we've been told not true?

29:27.575 --> 29:28.635
Jim?

29:28.635 --> 29:30.105
Of course they
told you the truth.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.345
This was a long time ago.

29:33.345 --> 29:38.885
So why don't I look into seeing
if anything has surfaced,

29:38.885 --> 29:41.885
and, uh, I'll get back to you.

29:43.355 --> 29:44.425
Fair enough?

29:50.455 --> 29:55.035
Really quick, do
you remember this man?

29:55.765 --> 29:57.865
His name is Dr. Eric Walker.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.905
I know who he is.

30:00.905 --> 30:02.535
You do?

30:02.535 --> 30:03.705
I mean, I did.

30:03.705 --> 30:05.505
He-- it was a long time ago.

30:05.505 --> 30:09.345
He's a different man now.

30:09.345 --> 30:10.745
What do you mean?

30:13.485 --> 30:14.515
Sorry, Dallas.

30:14.515 --> 30:15.955
I wish I could
help you out more.

30:15.955 --> 30:19.385
Another thing-- you find
anything else in that box?

30:22.425 --> 30:23.425
Nope.

30:26.165 --> 30:27.725
Nothing else.

30:28.465 --> 30:29.735
Okay.

30:30.565 --> 30:32.935
Then have a good day.

30:32.935 --> 30:34.105
You too.

30:36.935 --> 30:41.145
Hey, say hi to
your mom for me.

30:51.425 --> 30:52.585
We have a situation.

30:52.585 --> 30:56.225
I need a surveillance team
deployed tonight on that kid.

30:56.225 --> 30:58.465
I may have found Walker's
missing hardware.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.735
<i>One time I read that reality</i>

31:08.735 --> 31:10.105
<i>is created by the observer.</i>

31:10.105 --> 31:13.505
<i>Like, if a tree falls in a
forest and nobody's there,</i>

31:13.505 --> 31:14.975
<i>does it make a sound?</i>

31:14.975 --> 31:17.415
<i>Well, now scientists
say that the tree</i>

31:17.415 --> 31:18.945
<i>doesn't even fucking
exist unless there's</i>

31:18.945 --> 31:20.345
<i>someone there to see it.</i>

31:20.345 --> 31:21.415
<i>Think about that.</i>

31:21.415 --> 31:22.455
Enjoy.

31:25.225 --> 31:26.355
Can I help you?

31:26.355 --> 31:27.825
Hi. Can I just get a bottle--

31:27.825 --> 31:28.925
Ah! Let me stop you.

31:28.925 --> 31:31.095
I know, you're
thinking pour over.

31:31.095 --> 31:33.995
But, it's crazy, everyone
wants pour over these days.

31:33.995 --> 31:35.995
And really, you just,
like, need a break.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.965
I think a matcha latte
is going to get your day

31:38.965 --> 31:40.365
in the right direction.

31:40.365 --> 31:41.835
Let me sort you out.

31:41.835 --> 31:44.305
Yeah, could I just get
a bottle of water, please?

31:46.405 --> 31:47.415
Hi.

31:48.315 --> 31:49.475
Hi.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.815
Hey, beat it.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.215
I've worked here
way longer than you.

31:57.255 --> 31:58.485
Um--

31:58.485 --> 32:02.225
Hi. Could I just get a
bottle of water, please?

32:05.825 --> 32:07.295
Bottle of water?

32:07.295 --> 32:08.495
Oh, right.

32:10.235 --> 32:11.295
Thanks.

32:11.295 --> 32:12.705
One water.

32:12.705 --> 32:14.035
Two bucks.

32:16.675 --> 32:18.645
I've never seen you here before.

32:18.645 --> 32:21.145
I just moved here
like seven days ago.

32:21.145 --> 32:22.315
Oh, yeah?

32:22.315 --> 32:23.845
Well, I'm Dallas.

32:24.515 --> 32:25.845
That's an interesting name.

32:27.015 --> 32:28.315
- Kelly.
Kelly.

32:28.315 --> 32:30.915
Nice to meet you.

32:30.915 --> 32:34.595
Uh, random question,
but is the beach nearby?

32:34.595 --> 32:36.555
I actually haven't seen it yet.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.255
Want a tour?

32:38.255 --> 32:40.165
I'll fucking show you
the beach right now.

32:40.165 --> 32:41.265
I don't care.

32:41.265 --> 32:45.235
I'll quit this stellar
career and give you a tour--

32:45.235 --> 32:46.335
be your guide.

32:46.335 --> 32:47.365
Fuck it.

32:50.605 --> 32:51.605
Thanks.

32:52.945 --> 32:54.205
Have a good one.

32:59.885 --> 33:01.085
I dare you.

33:04.085 --> 33:05.085
Come on.

33:14.395 --> 33:15.895
Okay.

33:27.075 --> 33:29.245
So why are you actually
hiding out in Encinitas?

33:30.245 --> 33:31.715
Assault?

33:31.715 --> 33:32.785
Murder?

33:32.785 --> 33:34.145
Oh yeah, you got me.

33:34.145 --> 33:36.555
I'm actually a master villain.

33:36.555 --> 33:37.585
I knew it.

33:38.485 --> 33:41.325
So this is the tour?

33:41.325 --> 33:42.895
Patience.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.125
We're almost there.

33:44.125 --> 33:47.665
Wait, can I trust you?

33:47.665 --> 33:51.565
What, you don't follow random
dudes into the mountains?

33:51.565 --> 33:52.935
Come on.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.475
You got no issues here.

33:55.475 --> 33:58.135
I follow strange people
into all sorts of places,

33:58.135 --> 34:03.675
even typical San Diego
skateboarders like you.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.075
Ouch.

34:05.075 --> 34:07.015
But I'm so much more than that.

34:07.015 --> 34:10.085
Well, in that
case, I apologize.

34:10.085 --> 34:14.595
You are a deep and
emotionally complex man.

34:14.595 --> 34:15.955
That's more like it.

34:17.525 --> 34:21.435
You are a bit forward,
I'll give you that.

34:21.435 --> 34:22.835
Well, thank you.

34:22.835 --> 34:25.705
We have just about arrived.

34:25.705 --> 34:27.475
Come on, it's just
down this way.

34:29.875 --> 34:31.305
Oh, shit.

34:31.975 --> 34:33.045
Just almost ate it.

34:33.045 --> 34:34.615
Take them off.

34:34.615 --> 34:35.775
Huh?

34:35.775 --> 34:36.845
Your shoes.

34:36.845 --> 34:38.375
They make it a lot
harder to walk.

34:42.715 --> 34:44.155
Just don't look down.

34:45.015 --> 34:48.525
Look up at the view.

34:57.905 --> 35:00.235
It's beautiful up here.

35:02.835 --> 35:05.035
You want to hear
something kind of cool?

35:05.035 --> 35:06.905
Well, now that you've
got me here, I do sort of

35:06.905 --> 35:08.205
expect to be entertained.

35:08.205 --> 35:09.475
Good.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.885
My dad said he wanted
to show me something.

35:11.885 --> 35:13.485
I thought it was
going to be this view,

35:13.485 --> 35:14.685
the tide or whatever.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.055
The water was like
glass that night.

35:20.385 --> 35:24.395
But then, right
above that horizon,

35:24.395 --> 35:27.425
there's this little white
light dangling in the sky.

35:27.425 --> 35:32.605
No big deal, but it moved like
nothing I'd ever seen before.

35:34.205 --> 35:36.105
It was the craziest shit.

35:36.105 --> 35:39.375
Darting across the
sky like magic.

35:41.475 --> 35:43.545
What, like, a UFO?

35:45.585 --> 35:48.455
How do you know it wasn't
a plane or something?

35:48.455 --> 35:51.115
Well, at first
I thought it was.

35:51.115 --> 35:57.525
But UFOs, they have this
certain thing about them.

35:57.525 --> 35:58.925
They don't really fly.

35:58.925 --> 36:02.635
Well, they say they pull and
bend on the surrounding area.

36:02.635 --> 36:04.935
At least that's the legend--

36:04.935 --> 36:07.205
snapping around
from here to there.

36:07.205 --> 36:09.275
To them, though,
it's a straight shot.

36:11.575 --> 36:13.575
How do you know
so much about UFOs?

36:15.145 --> 36:16.375
Are you a weirdo?

36:17.415 --> 36:20.085
My dad used to tell me
a lot about this stuff.

36:21.685 --> 36:23.455
I'm now starting to
think he must have known

36:23.455 --> 36:27.925
a lot more about it than he
told me, because I actually just

36:27.925 --> 36:32.065
found out he was a part of a
super-secret military program

36:32.065 --> 36:33.265
that studied them.

36:33.265 --> 36:36.065
What did he do
for the military?

36:36.065 --> 36:38.235
Well, officially
he was a pilot.

36:38.235 --> 36:40.265
But anything he ever
did was classified,

36:40.265 --> 36:41.575
so I never, like, really knew.

36:41.575 --> 36:42.635
You know what I mean?

36:43.605 --> 36:46.275
Then one day he went
to work as usual

36:46.275 --> 36:50.175
and, uh, just never came back.

36:55.115 --> 36:56.415
I'm sorry.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.685
That's horrible.

37:00.855 --> 37:02.925
Nah, it's fine.

37:02.925 --> 37:04.295
I just go one day at a time--

37:04.295 --> 37:07.295
try to keep my mind
on better things.

37:08.665 --> 37:09.935
What about you?

37:09.935 --> 37:11.805
Why are you actually
in Encinitas?

37:12.565 --> 37:13.665
Uh...

37:14.205 --> 37:15.675
My dad is sick.

37:15.675 --> 37:19.775
These promising new
treatments at UCSD.

37:19.775 --> 37:24.645
So I'm just partying out here
while he's in the hospital.

37:28.755 --> 37:30.455
Jesus.

37:30.455 --> 37:32.355
We have pathetic
lives, don't we?

37:34.355 --> 37:35.955
I thought this was
going to be fun.

37:35.955 --> 37:37.965
God damn it.

37:37.965 --> 37:40.295
This was like the
worst date ever.

37:40.295 --> 37:44.765
Oh, so you're calling
this a date now.

37:45.835 --> 37:47.805
I'm not sure yet.

37:47.805 --> 37:49.175
I'll let you know.

37:55.275 --> 37:57.545
Yeah. Well, that
meeting was a joke.

37:58.215 --> 37:59.485
Of course it was.

37:59.485 --> 38:00.645
Why, he didn't say anything?

38:00.645 --> 38:02.755
Nothing. He wasn't
about to tell me shit.

38:02.755 --> 38:03.985
What did he say?

38:03.985 --> 38:05.355
I'll look into it.

38:05.355 --> 38:06.825
And then he took
all the documents

38:06.825 --> 38:07.895
and locked them in the safe.

38:07.895 --> 38:08.995
What a douchebag.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.155
Yeah.

38:10.155 --> 38:11.825
At least we still
have the device.

38:11.825 --> 38:13.325
No way I'm letting him get that.

38:13.325 --> 38:15.325
Yeah, he may have
taken those reports.

38:15.325 --> 38:18.905
But I actually found something
kind of interesting here.

38:18.905 --> 38:21.005
So that location
from the device,

38:21.005 --> 38:22.875
I actually looked it up.

38:22.875 --> 38:25.875
Guys, there's some weird
shit happening there lately.

38:25.875 --> 38:27.075
Like what?

38:27.075 --> 38:28.545
Check it out.

38:32.215 --> 38:33.445
It's crazy.

38:38.125 --> 38:40.525
Your dad only had one
set of coordinates

38:40.525 --> 38:42.925
on that military GPS, so
I feel like that's kind of

38:42.925 --> 38:44.195
important to the story I guess.

38:44.195 --> 38:45.725
Please stop guessing.

38:45.725 --> 38:47.565
I'm a scientist.

38:47.565 --> 38:50.765
Man, it's so strange how
my dad had these coordinates

38:50.765 --> 38:53.565
of paranormal hotspots
in the notebook and now

38:53.565 --> 38:56.975
on this device, when they were
supposed to be studying UFOs.

38:58.905 --> 38:59.905
Where is this?

39:01.005 --> 39:02.645
Only an hour East from here.

39:03.815 --> 39:05.415
Sounds dumb. Let's not go.

39:06.245 --> 39:07.755
Maybe it's all connected.

39:09.485 --> 39:12.685
You know, like, UFOs aren't
what we think they are.

39:15.125 --> 39:17.425
We might as well
go out there and see.

39:19.425 --> 39:21.235
It's not like your dad's
prick friend at the Navy

39:21.235 --> 39:22.435
is going to help us at all.

39:24.295 --> 39:25.935
This might be dangerous.

39:26.935 --> 39:28.435
It might be frightening.

39:29.275 --> 39:31.505
This might make
me shit my pants.

39:32.445 --> 39:33.445
Road trip.

39:33.445 --> 39:35.415
Road trip.
No!

40:01.305 --> 40:03.205
Why are we bringing
some random chick along?

40:03.205 --> 40:05.445
I know, dude.
This is serious stuff.

40:05.445 --> 40:08.375
We're here to investigate,
not finger bang.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.545
Again, that's why
your dad's not coming.

40:13.345 --> 40:15.285
Yo, guys, she's cool.

40:15.285 --> 40:16.885
Trust me.

40:16.885 --> 40:17.925
Okay?

40:19.485 --> 40:20.725
I'll be right back.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.395
Is that your dick?

40:33.035 --> 40:34.065
Oh no!

40:34.065 --> 40:35.405
- Tickle! Tickle!
- Ow. Stop!

40:35.405 --> 40:37.675
- Let me suck it!
- Get off! Fuck.

40:39.405 --> 40:41.675
So you must be Dallas.

40:42.175 --> 40:43.815
Hi. Yes, ma'am.

40:43.815 --> 40:47.345
And you're taking my daughter
camping with you this weekend--

40:47.345 --> 40:48.655
with them?

40:51.355 --> 40:52.485
Yes, ma'am.

40:52.485 --> 40:53.655
We-- we love camping.

40:53.655 --> 40:56.555
I'm a-- I'm a
camping kind of man.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.695
Will there be
an adult with you?

41:00.195 --> 41:01.665
A licensed driver?

41:01.665 --> 41:04.265
Yes, ma'am. My friend
Toe will be driving.

41:04.265 --> 41:06.835
He's super responsible.

41:11.105 --> 41:12.605
Hey, honey.

41:12.605 --> 41:15.175
Just-- just one--
just one second.

41:15.175 --> 41:16.515
She can't go.

41:16.515 --> 41:17.775
They're assholes.

41:18.645 --> 41:20.445
Motherfucker,
let go of me!

41:24.385 --> 41:26.025
Fuck! Are you kidding?

41:26.025 --> 41:27.585
- Yeah!
- Get the fuck off!

41:29.955 --> 41:31.295
Good job, assholes!

41:31.295 --> 41:32.695
What happened?

41:32.695 --> 41:34.595
Her mom heard your dick stuff
and wouldn't let her come.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.265
Oh, is that funny?

41:38.265 --> 41:39.465
Ow!

41:39.465 --> 41:40.935
Don't get fucking mad at me.

41:40.935 --> 41:44.235
Toe is the one who attacked
my-- my-- my dick and balls.

41:44.235 --> 41:45.675
I'll do it again if I want.

41:46.275 --> 41:47.475
Fuck!

41:47.475 --> 41:49.615
Well, it was rapey
in my fucking opinion.

41:50.415 --> 41:52.215
Holy shit.

41:52.215 --> 41:53.245
That's the girl?

41:53.245 --> 41:55.485
Oh, shit. She's rad.

42:04.425 --> 42:05.425
Drive.

42:53.475 --> 42:55.615
So are you guys
always this quiet

42:55.615 --> 42:57.515
or are you just scared of girls?

42:57.515 --> 42:58.685
No, we're not scared.

42:58.685 --> 43:01.115
Just, look, we like girls.

43:01.115 --> 43:03.155
We're just protecting
our hearts right now.

43:04.655 --> 43:06.455
Come on, man.
Leave her alone.

43:06.455 --> 43:08.855
How did you two meet anyway?

43:08.855 --> 43:11.125
Well, your friend
Dallas gave me a tour

43:11.125 --> 43:12.225
of the beach the other day.

43:15.065 --> 43:17.565
Hey, do girls stare
at themselves naked?

43:18.365 --> 43:19.835
What?

43:21.265 --> 43:23.005
Toe, cut it out, man.

43:23.005 --> 43:24.035
Toe?

43:24.535 --> 43:25.575
Is that your name?

43:25.575 --> 43:26.845
No, it's a nickname.

43:26.845 --> 43:29.145
It stands for Theory
Of Everything.

43:29.145 --> 43:31.045
So what's your real name then?

43:31.945 --> 43:33.015
Lester.

43:37.185 --> 43:38.225
Ow!

43:38.225 --> 43:39.525
God.

43:42.595 --> 43:44.025
Fire hazard.

43:44.025 --> 43:48.065
So Dallas says you guys are into
like hunting ghosts and stuff?

43:48.065 --> 43:50.435
Is there ghosts or
something in the mountains

43:50.435 --> 43:51.605
that I should know about?

43:51.605 --> 43:53.505
Remember how I told
you about my dad's work?

43:53.505 --> 43:54.835
Yeah.

43:54.835 --> 43:57.405
Well, we found
a location in one

43:57.405 --> 43:59.775
of his old military
notebooks that may be--

44:00.945 --> 44:02.275
interesting.

44:02.275 --> 44:03.715
Unverified.

44:03.715 --> 44:04.985
What does that mean?

44:05.815 --> 44:07.715
What do you
think about Bigfoot?

44:31.505 --> 44:36.545
Wow, that's a pretty nice
coffeemaker for a camping trip.

44:36.545 --> 44:37.875
The fuck is that?

44:37.875 --> 44:39.045
Shut it.

44:39.045 --> 44:40.715
You all will be thanking me
tomorrow morning

44:40.715 --> 44:43.715
when you're sipping
on a hot cup of God's juice.

44:43.715 --> 44:46.155
Hey yo, Riley, what
exactly should we

44:46.155 --> 44:47.495
be looking for out here again?

44:47.495 --> 44:48.955
Lucifer, dumbass.

44:50.495 --> 44:52.565
Well, maybe.

44:52.565 --> 44:54.125
But I'd suggest we
do a night hike--

44:54.125 --> 44:57.665
listen for sounds, look for
footprints and shit like that.

44:57.665 --> 45:00.265
Really, anything the dark
is fun in my opinion.

45:00.265 --> 45:01.405
You guys are fun.

45:01.405 --> 45:02.805
I love this.

45:02.805 --> 45:03.735
I don't.

45:03.735 --> 45:06.305
I think they're
immature and reckless.

45:06.305 --> 45:08.575
They need better mothers.

45:08.575 --> 45:09.775
Apparently there
have been missing

45:09.775 --> 45:12.115
people out here for decades--

45:12.115 --> 45:15.215
like people vanishing
within feet from each other.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.025
It's creepy stuff.

45:19.025 --> 45:20.085
Great.

45:20.085 --> 45:21.595
That sounds awesome.

45:22.795 --> 45:24.965
Well, whether you like
it or not, it's happening.

45:26.125 --> 45:29.995
Let me guess, he is
the inquisitive one.

45:29.995 --> 45:32.635
He has been known to be
above average at school.

45:33.305 --> 45:35.035
Not like Toe.

45:35.035 --> 45:36.175
Complete opposite.

45:36.175 --> 45:39.245
I was what the doctors
diagnosed as salacious.

45:45.015 --> 45:48.455
So have you guys ever
seen any actual ghosts?

45:48.455 --> 45:50.455
Well, the closest
we ever got was

45:50.455 --> 45:51.985
Riley's mom in a bathing suit.

46:06.035 --> 46:07.065
What was that?

46:08.705 --> 46:10.135
It's classified.

46:10.135 --> 46:12.645
I'd tell you then, but then
I'd have to fuck your dad.

46:12.645 --> 46:14.205
No, the noise you dickhead.

46:14.205 --> 46:15.345
Did you not hear that?

46:21.515 --> 46:22.755
I heard that.

46:26.755 --> 46:28.355
There's something over there.

46:34.025 --> 46:36.365
Whatever it is, it's moving.

46:39.965 --> 46:40.965
Let's go.

46:42.135 --> 46:43.405
Go where?

46:43.405 --> 46:45.245
To where the adventure is.

46:46.545 --> 46:48.045
Grab your bag.

47:04.565 --> 47:06.465
Were you
serious about people

47:06.465 --> 47:08.395
disappearing and all that shit?

47:08.395 --> 47:09.965
Fuck yeah, I'm serious.

47:09.965 --> 47:12.405
People would be walking like
this close to each other,

47:12.405 --> 47:14.975
and then they'd turn away
for literally like a second

47:14.975 --> 47:16.735
and the person would be gone.

47:19.845 --> 47:23.845
There are rumors of people
seeing shapes, apparitions.

47:26.245 --> 47:27.785
People from all
over the world come

47:27.785 --> 47:29.185
here looking for the bodies.

47:31.085 --> 47:32.585
None of them are ever found.

47:42.195 --> 47:43.395
It's that way.

47:43.395 --> 47:44.935
Okay.
So what do we do?

47:46.805 --> 47:48.735
What are we standing here for?

47:48.735 --> 47:50.005
Come on.

48:19.565 --> 48:21.405
Oh, shit.

48:22.575 --> 48:23.605
- Who's--
God.

48:23.605 --> 48:24.675
Who's first?

48:25.875 --> 48:28.545
You think
something's in there?

48:28.545 --> 48:29.645
I hope not.

48:29.645 --> 48:32.445
Guys, people get
raped in caves.

48:32.445 --> 48:33.485
What?

48:33.485 --> 48:35.455
How the fuck would you
know something like that?

48:35.455 --> 48:36.985
I know all kinds of things.

48:36.985 --> 48:39.185
I have psychic gifts.

48:39.185 --> 48:41.495
Oh fuck, I'm going to throw up.

48:41.495 --> 48:43.325
I'm so high.

48:47.665 --> 48:48.895
We need to go in.

48:50.335 --> 48:51.335
I'm in.

48:52.505 --> 48:55.305
Kelly, if you're scared, I
can wait out here with you.

48:55.305 --> 48:56.735
I'm going in.

48:56.735 --> 48:58.305
Fuck, you said
that awfully fast.

48:58.305 --> 49:00.575
We didn't come all this
way just to turn back, right?

49:00.575 --> 49:02.045
I disagree.

49:02.045 --> 49:03.115
He's in.

49:05.915 --> 49:07.185
Let's do this.

49:32.745 --> 49:34.675
Jesus, what's that smell?

49:34.675 --> 49:35.745
It's awful.

49:35.745 --> 49:37.145
Was that me?

49:38.145 --> 49:39.915
Come on, guys.
Keep moving.

49:44.725 --> 49:46.755
Okay.

49:46.755 --> 49:49.425
I'm starting to get
a bit freaked out.

49:49.425 --> 49:51.095
Yeah, me too.

49:52.165 --> 49:54.435
Guys, I need to
tell you something.

49:54.435 --> 49:55.565
What's up?

49:55.565 --> 49:58.735
All those missing
person cases,

49:58.735 --> 50:00.265
they're occurring
throughout the world,

50:00.265 --> 50:03.605
and they're all happening
near natural cave systems.

50:10.915 --> 50:12.115
Where's Toe?

50:12.115 --> 50:13.485
Toe!

50:13.485 --> 50:14.615
Toe!

50:15.915 --> 50:17.115
Where'd he go?

50:30.435 --> 50:31.465
Toe!

50:33.465 --> 50:34.505
Fuck.

50:34.505 --> 50:35.605
Toe!

50:51.455 --> 50:52.455
Toe!

50:53.625 --> 50:55.055
Stop being an idiot.

51:08.535 --> 51:10.375
Oh, my God!

51:17.375 --> 51:19.315
Bigfoot!

51:22.055 --> 51:23.955
Suck my dick, beast!

51:23.955 --> 51:25.485
I will not die tonight!

51:29.695 --> 51:31.325
Oh, my God!

51:34.495 --> 51:35.635
What the fuck.

51:35.635 --> 51:36.795
You idiot, get off.

51:36.795 --> 51:37.995
Bear with
me, I'm in danger.

51:37.995 --> 51:39.265
Get off.

51:40.035 --> 51:41.505
Where's the way out?

51:43.005 --> 51:44.975
Who the fuck's
unzipping their pants.

51:44.975 --> 51:46.045
Hold on.

51:46.045 --> 51:47.145
I have something.

51:47.145 --> 51:48.475
Oh shit, it's behind us.

51:48.475 --> 51:49.375
Let's go!

51:49.375 --> 51:51.645
What do you
mean it's behind us?

51:55.415 --> 51:56.915
Oh shit!
Go! Go!

51:56.915 --> 51:58.185
Shit!

52:05.395 --> 52:06.395
Run!

52:07.765 --> 52:08.995
Oh, it's real!

52:08.995 --> 52:10.435
It's definitely real!

52:30.925 --> 52:34.855
Shit!

52:34.855 --> 52:36.525
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

52:36.525 --> 52:37.865
I don't want to die.

52:37.865 --> 52:38.925
Let's hide in the tent!

52:38.925 --> 52:40.095
Why would we hide in the tent?

52:40.095 --> 52:41.435
Maybe it hates tents!

52:41.435 --> 52:43.035
Why the fuck
would it hate tents?

52:43.035 --> 52:44.065
Just get in the tent!

52:44.065 --> 52:45.135
God damn it.

52:50.975 --> 52:52.375
What the fuck.
We're gonna die!

52:53.245 --> 52:54.745
Shut the fuck up.

52:54.745 --> 52:56.245
Shut the fuck up.

53:02.815 --> 53:04.425
Oh, my God, it's his dick.

53:05.585 --> 53:06.985
Shh. Shh.

53:06.985 --> 53:08.255
Stop it.

53:09.525 --> 53:12.795
Oh, my God.

53:33.045 --> 53:34.485
I think he's gone.

53:35.885 --> 53:37.085
Check to see if it's gone.

53:37.085 --> 53:38.625
Hell no, I'm not checking
to see if it's gone.

53:38.625 --> 53:39.485
What the fuck.

53:39.485 --> 53:40.755
Get the fuck out
there and check.

53:40.755 --> 53:42.155
- You get the fuck--
- Go out the door and check.

53:42.155 --> 53:43.255
- You go--
- Go and--

53:43.255 --> 53:44.295
You go out there.

53:44.295 --> 53:45.825
Just go out the door.

53:45.825 --> 53:47.465
- Okay.
- Go. Go.

53:55.605 --> 53:57.035
Oh, God, no!

53:58.605 --> 54:00.005
Oh, God.

54:00.005 --> 54:01.875
Oh, God, no!

54:01.875 --> 54:04.015
It's still here.

54:10.555 --> 54:12.055
I'm covered in piss.

54:30.875 --> 54:31.975
Whoa!

54:51.865 --> 54:52.865
Is that--

54:55.865 --> 54:57.565
I know you.

54:57.565 --> 54:58.765
You're Dr. Walker.

55:00.405 --> 55:02.205
Never heard of him.
Who are you?

55:02.205 --> 55:04.605
Sir, I smell like piss.

55:05.605 --> 55:07.075
I need a mint--

55:07.075 --> 55:08.775
badly.

55:08.775 --> 55:11.685
If you aren't Dr. Walker,
then who are you?

55:11.685 --> 55:12.845
The Bigfoot Hunter?

55:12.845 --> 55:13.885
Bigfoot.

55:13.885 --> 55:15.555
Yeah. You're crazy.

55:16.485 --> 55:17.955
Then you wouldn't
happen to know anything

55:17.955 --> 55:21.555
about the Advanced Aviation
Threat Identification Program,

55:21.555 --> 55:22.855
would you?

55:22.855 --> 55:24.695
What about Aaron Edwards?

55:24.695 --> 55:26.895
Wouldn't happen to know
about him either then?

55:28.225 --> 55:29.495
Who's asking?

55:30.065 --> 55:32.335
His son, Dallas.

55:35.905 --> 55:39.605
Aaron Edwards was the best
pilot who ever worked for me.

55:39.605 --> 55:41.715
He was tuned into
the right frequency,

55:41.715 --> 55:42.815
if you know what I mean.

55:45.645 --> 55:46.815
I knew it was you.

55:47.855 --> 55:51.485
The question is, how
did you guys get here?

55:53.025 --> 55:54.425
I'm betting that
you found something

55:54.425 --> 55:56.925
that you shouldn't have, and
you turned it on, didn't ya?

55:58.295 --> 55:59.925
I don't know what
you're talking about.

56:01.165 --> 56:02.235
Give it to me.

56:02.235 --> 56:03.495
Give what?

56:04.465 --> 56:05.605
The GPS.

56:07.265 --> 56:10.005
Look, I know that
it brought you here.

56:10.005 --> 56:11.475
I invented the thing.

56:26.885 --> 56:27.755
What's it do?

56:27.755 --> 56:30.595
We only saw one
set of coordinates.

56:30.595 --> 56:33.495
With the right code, this
will open up coordinates that'll

56:33.495 --> 56:36.265
show you all sorts of things.

56:36.265 --> 56:38.765
I invented this technical
and very expensive

56:38.765 --> 56:42.705
device to track
microgravitational anomalies.

56:42.705 --> 56:45.275
UFOs tend to congregate
in one place.

56:45.275 --> 56:49.275
And when they do, we can
track microfluctuations

56:49.275 --> 56:51.315
in the gravity of
the atmosphere.

56:51.315 --> 56:52.545
You understand?

56:54.655 --> 56:57.315
What was that thing
back there in the woods?

56:57.315 --> 56:58.455
I don't know, a bear.

56:58.455 --> 56:59.855
Hell if I know.

56:59.855 --> 57:01.795
Right, a bear.

57:01.795 --> 57:03.395
We just saw a giant
furry man-thing back there.

57:03.395 --> 57:04.665
What the hell was that?

57:04.665 --> 57:05.865
With sharp teeth.

57:05.865 --> 57:07.425
Yeah, I don't think so.

57:09.495 --> 57:13.405
UFO technology to play
with your perception.

57:13.405 --> 57:14.465
It's a parlor trick.

57:14.465 --> 57:17.035
It's semi-supernatural--
a hologram

57:17.035 --> 57:18.905
of fire, a burning bush.

57:18.905 --> 57:21.545
How about this, a burning
bush that can talk, huh?

57:21.545 --> 57:23.315
Makes you think, doesn't it?

57:23.315 --> 57:27.245
This stuff is going to
alter and shatter any idea

57:27.245 --> 57:28.815
you have about reality.

57:28.815 --> 57:31.885
So my advice, you
just go on your way.

57:31.885 --> 57:32.985
Okay?

57:32.985 --> 57:34.995
Go back to your sleepaway camp.

57:34.995 --> 57:37.055
I fucking love sleepaway camp.

57:37.055 --> 57:41.865
Wait, doc-- what happened
the night my dad disappeared?

57:41.865 --> 57:43.495
<i>I think
the only person who</i>

57:43.495 --> 57:46.005
<i>can answer that is your father.</i>

57:46.005 --> 57:51.205
The night he disappeared,
that's the last anybody

57:51.205 --> 57:52.275
ever saw of him.

57:52.275 --> 57:53.905
Are you kidding me?

57:53.905 --> 57:55.015
That's all you got?

57:55.015 --> 57:57.275
Things that we
don't understand

57:57.275 --> 57:59.715
tend to make us angry,
and they should.

58:01.385 --> 58:03.585
Well, is he dead or not?

58:05.325 --> 58:06.725
I don't know, son.

58:07.995 --> 58:11.965
But now that I think of
it, I may have something

58:11.965 --> 58:13.465
that can answer this riddle.

58:15.235 --> 58:16.465
Here's a map.

58:17.635 --> 58:19.905
Meet me at my place
tomorrow at 2:00--

58:20.905 --> 58:23.575
just north of here
in the high desert.

58:23.575 --> 58:24.945
And don't tell anybody.

58:26.145 --> 58:27.405
You understand me?

58:28.345 --> 58:29.575
You tell no one.

58:30.815 --> 58:31.945
Have a good night.

58:38.925 --> 58:41.595
Sir, we got Walker.

58:42.455 --> 58:44.965
The kids found him.

59:46.685 --> 59:49.955
You guys know I made out
with Kathleen Snyder here once.

59:49.955 --> 59:51.055
Unverified.

59:51.055 --> 59:52.525
Oh, I verified that ass.

59:52.525 --> 59:55.235
Then prove to us she got
diarrhea the next morning.

59:55.235 --> 59:57.695
Oh-- not tonight.

01:00:01.335 --> 01:00:03.175
What is this place?

01:00:03.175 --> 01:00:06.075
Just a spot we go to
when nothing else is open.

01:00:10.015 --> 01:00:12.785
Summer is finally starting
to get a bit better, right?

01:00:13.845 --> 01:00:15.255
Yeah.

01:00:15.255 --> 01:00:16.615
Yeah, I guess it is.

01:00:18.225 --> 01:00:20.055
You know, your friends are--

01:00:21.255 --> 01:00:22.595
a riot.

01:00:22.595 --> 01:00:24.095
That's a good thing, right?

01:00:24.095 --> 01:00:25.265
Yeah, very.

01:00:26.265 --> 01:00:27.695
You're really
lucky to have them.

01:00:29.765 --> 01:00:36.275
When my dad got sick,
I felt really alone.

01:00:38.105 --> 01:00:41.715
My friends just didn't have
that much to give I guess.

01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:44.545
That sucks.

01:00:49.455 --> 01:00:51.085
Want to know something
kind of cool?

01:00:53.055 --> 01:00:54.055
Sure.

01:00:56.055 --> 01:01:03.135
There was this scientist
in Japan who did a bunch

01:01:03.135 --> 01:01:04.805
of studies on human intention.

01:01:06.265 --> 01:01:09.875
So he wrote down a bunch of
words on small pieces of paper,

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:14.305
like murder, hate,
violence, and then peace,

01:01:14.305 --> 01:01:16.875
and hope, and love, or whatever.

01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:19.485
And when he stuck
those pieces of paper

01:01:19.485 --> 01:01:23.385
to little dishes of
water and froze it,

01:01:23.385 --> 01:01:27.755
there were all these different
results under a microscope.

01:01:29.195 --> 01:01:30.225
Okay.

01:01:30.225 --> 01:01:31.625
You have my attention.

01:01:33.825 --> 01:01:35.295
Well, the bad words--

01:01:35.295 --> 01:01:41.235
the negative ones-- they froze
as these ugly, gelatinous blobs

01:01:41.235 --> 01:01:43.205
with no form and no shape.

01:01:44.305 --> 01:01:49.075
But the good ones, they
froze as these perfectly

01:01:49.075 --> 01:01:56.115
symmetrical ice crystals, like
magical microscopic snowflakes.

01:01:58.785 --> 01:02:02.425
So I guess what I'm
getting at is, just

01:02:02.425 --> 01:02:08.935
by using our intention,
just how we choose to feel,

01:02:08.935 --> 01:02:12.205
I believe it can
really change things.

01:02:13.635 --> 01:02:20.805
So there's still
hope for your dad.

01:02:24.675 --> 01:02:26.885
I think he's going
to be just fine.

01:02:45.935 --> 01:02:48.475
Woo!

01:03:11.965 --> 01:03:12.965
Hello?

01:03:15.595 --> 01:03:17.365
You're so stressed out.

01:03:17.365 --> 01:03:18.765
I am stressed out because I--

01:03:18.765 --> 01:03:20.335
You know, even though
Dallas is the worst,

01:03:20.335 --> 01:03:22.235
this is why I come home.

01:03:22.235 --> 01:03:23.705
What's going on?

01:03:24.775 --> 01:03:26.175
Why do you look so exhausted?

01:03:26.175 --> 01:03:28.345
It's a long story.
I got to run.

01:03:28.345 --> 01:03:29.475
What is this, an intervention?

01:03:29.475 --> 01:03:33.015
Honey, there's something
we need to talk to you about.

01:03:33.015 --> 01:03:35.185
Look, I'd love
to chat and stuff--

01:03:35.185 --> 01:03:38.085
Myron and I were
talking, and we decided

01:03:38.085 --> 01:03:40.625
it would be best to move to
his house in Newport Beach

01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:42.395
after we get married next month.

01:03:43.795 --> 01:03:45.525
Next month?

01:03:45.525 --> 01:03:46.865
Dallas--
- Newport?

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:48.235
We don't want
to wait, buddy.

01:03:48.795 --> 01:03:50.295
Are you kidding me?

01:03:50.295 --> 01:03:52.705
I love your mom, and I want
to be part of this family.

01:03:52.705 --> 01:03:53.865
Excuse me?

01:03:53.865 --> 01:03:55.775
But you have no idea
what's going on, do you?

01:03:55.775 --> 01:03:58.945
None of you guys have any
idea what's happening.

01:03:58.945 --> 01:04:00.775
I'm literally about to
find out what happened

01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:02.715
to dad after all these years.

01:04:02.715 --> 01:04:05.245
We may finally learn
what actually happened!

01:04:05.845 --> 01:04:07.655
I'm this close.

01:04:07.655 --> 01:04:09.255
So no-- no--

01:04:09.255 --> 01:04:10.315
you can't do this.

01:04:10.315 --> 01:04:11.385
Not now.

01:04:11.385 --> 01:04:12.925
Do you know how
crazy you sound?

01:04:12.925 --> 01:04:14.885
You have no more
information than I do.

01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:16.725
Let it go, Dallas.

01:04:16.725 --> 01:04:18.225
You know what, you
do sound crazy!

01:04:18.225 --> 01:04:19.895
I'm not crazy!

01:04:19.895 --> 01:04:23.295
Dallas, what is
wrong with you?

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:25.235
Me?

01:04:25.235 --> 01:04:27.235
What's wrong with me?
What about you?

01:04:27.235 --> 01:04:30.235
You're wasting away,
drinking yourself to sleep.

01:04:30.235 --> 01:04:33.775
Crying, going high,
going low, crash-landing

01:04:33.775 --> 01:04:35.475
into bed every
night until we don't

01:04:35.475 --> 01:04:37.245
even recognize you anymore.

01:04:37.245 --> 01:04:40.515
And worst of all, you're just
using Myron to hide the pain.

01:04:40.515 --> 01:04:43.255
You are not in charge of me.

01:04:43.255 --> 01:04:46.785
Do you know what it's like
to be alone at my age?

01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:48.525
You don't!

01:04:48.525 --> 01:04:50.355
Nobody to help me raise Roman.

01:04:50.355 --> 01:04:52.765
Nobody at all to lean on.

01:04:52.765 --> 01:04:57.765
Nobody to-- nobody to love me.

01:04:57.765 --> 01:04:59.935
But you are loved!

01:04:59.935 --> 01:05:02.035
You're just too damn scared
to face the life you actually

01:05:02.035 --> 01:05:05.005
have instead of glue together
a shitty version of the one

01:05:05.005 --> 01:05:06.245
you want!

01:05:08.815 --> 01:05:10.275
Dallas, listen to me.

01:05:10.275 --> 01:05:13.485
Look, you can finally start
classes in LA or Orange County.

01:05:13.485 --> 01:05:15.115
You can meet new friends.

01:05:15.115 --> 01:05:16.985
This could be the fresh
start that you need.

01:05:16.985 --> 01:05:19.955
Oh yeah, and how would
you know what I need?

01:05:19.955 --> 01:05:21.995
I already went to your schools.

01:05:21.995 --> 01:05:23.455
I went to your churches.

01:05:23.455 --> 01:05:26.495
I played sports in your shitty
neighborhood sports leagues.

01:05:26.495 --> 01:05:28.895
And now you think
I'm crazy, right?

01:05:28.895 --> 01:05:30.535
Dad never thought I was crazy.

01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:31.635
Well, your dad isn't here.

01:05:31.635 --> 01:05:33.805
You can't marry
that douchebag!

01:05:45.715 --> 01:05:47.845
Dallas, come back here.

01:05:48.915 --> 01:05:50.685
Dallas, don't leave.

01:05:56.525 --> 01:06:00.065
<i>They say
our brain is a transducer.</i>

01:06:00.065 --> 01:06:03.095
<i>It converts one thing
into something else.</i>

01:06:03.095 --> 01:06:05.565
<i>It takes invisible
energies all around us</i>

01:06:05.565 --> 01:06:08.375
<i>and converts them into reality
the moment we think it.</i>

01:06:10.135 --> 01:06:11.675
<i>So what do people create?</i>

01:06:11.675 --> 01:06:14.415
<i>Or, most importantly, what
do they create when they're</i>

01:06:14.415 --> 01:06:15.445
<i>filled with fear and hate?</i>

01:06:17.815 --> 01:06:19.385
<i>What have we created then?</i>

01:06:44.235 --> 01:06:46.405
All right, I think this is it.

01:06:47.415 --> 01:06:49.815
Oh, I'm so hungry.

01:06:49.815 --> 01:06:52.015
All I have
are these pot brownies.

01:06:52.915 --> 01:06:54.655
You shitheads want some?

01:06:54.655 --> 01:06:55.955
I'm good.

01:06:58.925 --> 01:07:00.085
You okay?

01:07:01.025 --> 01:07:03.055
It's just family shit.

01:07:03.055 --> 01:07:07.395
Oh shit, did I just
eat six of these?

01:07:07.395 --> 01:07:08.435
You ate six?

01:07:09.595 --> 01:07:10.635
You're an idiot.

01:07:10.635 --> 01:07:15.435
You know what, stop
eating so much fucking pot.

01:07:15.435 --> 01:07:16.775
Stop.

01:07:16.775 --> 01:07:18.175
So annoying.

01:07:19.805 --> 01:07:23.945
Okay, these are the coordinates.

01:07:23.945 --> 01:07:25.415
This has to be it.

01:07:25.415 --> 01:07:28.245
It's like the only
dwelling for miles.

01:07:28.245 --> 01:07:31.015
The only people
who live out here are nudists.

01:07:31.015 --> 01:07:34.595
Or genius scientists on
the top 10 Most Wanted list.

01:07:34.595 --> 01:07:37.425
Any of us even know
why he's wanted at all?

01:07:37.425 --> 01:07:38.595
No.

01:07:38.595 --> 01:07:40.125
Touching genitals.

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:44.605
20 bucks says he's wanted for
a masturbation-related murder.

01:07:44.605 --> 01:07:46.005
Yeah.

01:07:46.005 --> 01:07:47.405
Well, let's find out.

01:07:52.045 --> 01:07:53.475
Toe, let me out.

01:07:53.475 --> 01:07:54.715
Let her out, Toe.

01:07:55.815 --> 01:07:57.115
You dropped your map.

01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:58.515
You dropped your pocket.

01:08:02.315 --> 01:08:03.785
Hello?

01:08:03.785 --> 01:08:05.425
Dr. Walker, are you in there?

01:08:12.565 --> 01:08:14.025
Thank God it's you.

01:08:14.025 --> 01:08:15.125
Come on in.

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:18.235
Yo, your house
looks creepy as fuck.

01:08:40.585 --> 01:08:42.925
Anybody see
anything out of the ordinary?

01:08:42.925 --> 01:08:45.225
Anything unusual, like a
black car or helicopter?

01:08:45.225 --> 01:08:48.565
No, uh, I don't think so.

01:08:55.305 --> 01:08:57.305
So Doc, what
are we doing here?

01:09:01.145 --> 01:09:03.075
It really is all real.

01:09:03.075 --> 01:09:05.245
Oh, all this and more.

01:09:05.245 --> 01:09:07.685
They don't want you
to know anything.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:09.015
What is all this stuff?

01:09:09.015 --> 01:09:11.725
Yeah, what is all this stuff?

01:09:11.725 --> 01:09:14.125
Are you part of a cult?

01:09:14.725 --> 01:09:17.295
No. Far from it.

01:09:17.295 --> 01:09:19.365
Okay, are we in danger?

01:09:19.365 --> 01:09:20.565
I mean, are we going to die?

01:09:20.565 --> 01:09:22.965
Well, you don't have
to be so dramatic.

01:09:22.965 --> 01:09:25.935
But truthfully, the
answers aren't easy.

01:09:25.935 --> 01:09:29.775
However, we do know a
lot more than when I was

01:09:29.775 --> 01:09:31.875
working with Dallas's father.

01:09:31.875 --> 01:09:33.705
Like what?

01:09:33.705 --> 01:09:38.985
Well, for centuries man
has told the story of God--

01:09:38.985 --> 01:09:40.415
how God created the universe.

01:09:40.415 --> 01:09:42.885
And the universe was
a well-ordered place

01:09:42.885 --> 01:09:45.055
with man at the center.

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:46.685
But then man began to ponder--

01:09:48.125 --> 01:09:49.625
thinking about a
spiritual world,

01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:54.095
a world you can't see but
filled with angels and demons--

01:09:54.095 --> 01:09:58.135
a story told within all
the religions combined.

01:10:00.265 --> 01:10:05.905
Then came the 1940s and
things began to merge.

01:10:05.905 --> 01:10:08.575
We discovered a new life form--

01:10:08.575 --> 01:10:13.445
not human, not spirit,
but very very advanced.

01:10:13.445 --> 01:10:16.855
We didn't know whether or
not they were good or evil

01:10:16.855 --> 01:10:18.755
primarily because
they wouldn't talk

01:10:18.755 --> 01:10:20.685
to us, at least not directly.

01:10:20.685 --> 01:10:25.995
But lately, they've been showing
themselves more frequently.

01:10:25.995 --> 01:10:28.365
And I-- I think
your father saw them

01:10:28.365 --> 01:10:31.635
up close and personal on the
night that he disappeared.

01:10:37.135 --> 01:10:40.545
So then, like, what
planet are they coming from?

01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:42.815
Well, it's a bit
more complex than that.

01:10:44.485 --> 01:10:47.115
You ever wonder why the
world is such a mess--

01:10:47.115 --> 01:10:49.955
why one part of the
world is Democratic,

01:10:49.955 --> 01:10:52.385
believes in free
will, the other part

01:10:52.385 --> 01:10:56.025
authoritarian,
a loss of individuality?

01:10:56.025 --> 01:10:58.895
Its competing races
and the influence

01:10:58.895 --> 01:11:01.295
that they have on mankind.

01:11:01.295 --> 01:11:04.035
So from the depths of the
ocean, to the far reaches

01:11:04.035 --> 01:11:06.465
of any mountain range,
or, hell, up to the--

01:11:06.465 --> 01:11:10.505
the dark side of the moon,
they've always been there.

01:11:11.605 --> 01:11:15.175
And throughout millennia,
they would pop up every couple

01:11:15.175 --> 01:11:18.485
of hundred years,
and they would teach us

01:11:18.485 --> 01:11:21.055
something important
about mathematics

01:11:21.055 --> 01:11:24.185
or language or science.

01:11:25.185 --> 01:11:29.195
But we hear these
voices in our head.

01:11:29.195 --> 01:11:30.555
We get these ideas--

01:11:30.555 --> 01:11:31.695
an epiphany.

01:11:33.195 --> 01:11:35.495
You see, they have
been teaching us

01:11:35.495 --> 01:11:39.365
and advancing us all this time.

01:11:48.915 --> 01:11:50.015
Set.

01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:51.845
There's no way the
government was ever

01:11:51.845 --> 01:11:53.345
going to tell us this, right?

01:11:53.345 --> 01:11:56.115
There's no way people
can actually handle this.

01:11:56.115 --> 01:11:58.525
Now, you're using your brain.

01:11:58.525 --> 01:12:01.095
You see, these are
things we already knew.

01:12:01.095 --> 01:12:02.625
We just didn't realize it.

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:07.125
And the rest of the
world, well, if they knew,

01:12:07.125 --> 01:12:09.595
it would scare the
pants off them.

01:12:09.595 --> 01:12:12.065
You're saying we
already know this stuff,

01:12:12.065 --> 01:12:13.965
which we clearly don't.

01:12:13.965 --> 01:12:16.705
So what's the connection?

01:12:16.705 --> 01:12:17.945
What am I missing here?

01:12:18.905 --> 01:12:20.275
The story you seek--

01:12:21.745 --> 01:12:26.215
the entire story-- it's right
there in front of your eyes

01:12:26.215 --> 01:12:27.685
hiding in plain sight.

01:12:31.525 --> 01:12:32.425
Shit!

01:12:32.425 --> 01:12:34.155
Someone followed us.

01:12:34.155 --> 01:12:35.655
- Okay.
- Shit.

01:12:38.295 --> 01:12:40.325
- All right then.
- Wait! What about my dad?

01:12:40.325 --> 01:12:41.635
You said you had
something for me, right?

01:12:41.635 --> 01:12:42.765
- We can't leave it--
- I'm sorry.

01:12:42.765 --> 01:12:44.235
We're going to have
to put a pin in it.

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:45.565
I know where the next
landing is going to be.

01:12:45.565 --> 01:12:47.665
Everybody, let's go.
Get off the rug!

01:12:52.305 --> 01:12:53.345
Climb in. Hurry!

01:12:53.345 --> 01:12:55.645
- What's down there?
- Answers.

01:12:59.445 --> 01:13:00.685
All right.
Run!

01:13:00.685 --> 01:13:01.755
Run!
Just go!

01:13:01.755 --> 01:13:03.455
Go! Go!

01:13:05.755 --> 01:13:06.855
Assault.

01:13:21.835 --> 01:13:23.335
Oh shit.

01:13:24.805 --> 01:13:25.875
Toe! Let's go!

01:13:25.875 --> 01:13:26.905
Come on!
Come on!

01:13:27.975 --> 01:13:29.045
All right, guys--

01:13:29.045 --> 01:13:30.775
guys-- guys, hold on.

01:13:30.775 --> 01:13:31.685
Hold on.

01:13:31.685 --> 01:13:33.345
All right, look,
just keep running.

01:13:33.345 --> 01:13:34.615
Get to the end of the tunnel.

01:13:34.615 --> 01:13:36.285
There's a highway there, Okay?

01:13:36.285 --> 01:13:38.785
I'll meet you there,
but don't look back!

01:13:38.785 --> 01:13:40.155
Just keep going, Okay?

01:13:40.155 --> 01:13:41.225
Jesus.

01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:42.895
You go! Just go!

01:13:42.895 --> 01:13:45.995
I just realized right now
that guy's fucking insane.

01:13:46.925 --> 01:13:48.465
What do we do?

01:13:48.465 --> 01:13:50.795
Do we help him or do
we get out of here?

01:13:50.795 --> 01:13:54.005
Guys, this might be the most
important night of our lives.

01:13:54.735 --> 01:13:55.735
I say we stay.

01:13:55.735 --> 01:13:57.875
I mean, what else
are we going to do?

01:14:00.775 --> 01:14:03.045
In all honesty,
dudes, I probably won't

01:14:03.045 --> 01:14:04.745
remember anything from tonight.

01:14:04.745 --> 01:14:05.845
Sorry.

01:14:07.445 --> 01:14:09.055
What the fuck was that?

01:14:09.055 --> 01:14:10.555
Fuck this, I'm out of here.

01:14:18.465 --> 01:14:20.325
Come on, open the door!

01:14:20.325 --> 01:14:21.995
What are you guys doing here?

01:14:21.995 --> 01:14:23.535
What was that back there?

01:14:23.535 --> 01:14:24.835
Better we destroy everything

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:26.435
than let them
get their hands on it.

01:14:26.435 --> 01:14:27.835
Who are you talking about?

01:14:27.835 --> 01:14:31.345
The agency-- the government
agency that doesn't exist.

01:14:31.345 --> 01:14:33.775
It's who your father
and I used to work for.

01:14:33.775 --> 01:14:35.215
They're behind this.

01:14:35.215 --> 01:14:36.845
Come on!
Come on, get the door!

01:14:36.845 --> 01:14:38.185
Come on.

01:14:38.185 --> 01:14:40.015
Was that a fucking gun?

01:14:40.015 --> 01:14:41.555
Just get the door open for--

01:14:42.215 --> 01:14:43.255
Okay!
Go!

01:14:43.255 --> 01:14:44.725
Go! Go!

01:14:57.135 --> 01:14:59.105
Hi, honey it's mom.

01:14:59.105 --> 01:15:00.235
Where are you?

01:15:00.235 --> 01:15:01.875
I'm starting to get worried.

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:03.075
You should come home.

01:15:04.335 --> 01:15:07.445
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.

01:15:07.445 --> 01:15:08.745
I love you.

01:15:10.075 --> 01:15:11.215
Bye.

01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:12.545
Hands. Hands!

01:15:12.545 --> 01:15:14.015
Show me your hands!

01:15:20.185 --> 01:15:21.455
Hey, Doc.

01:15:22.795 --> 01:15:23.825
Dallas.

01:15:39.005 --> 01:15:40.105
What's happening?

01:15:41.345 --> 01:15:43.245
Are we going
to be arrested?

01:15:43.245 --> 01:15:44.785
Don't worry, you're
going to be fine.

01:15:46.045 --> 01:15:48.455
He's taking us to a
place I used to work at.

01:16:24.315 --> 01:16:25.525
Dallas.

01:16:30.355 --> 01:16:32.995
It looks like you've gotten
yourself into a bit of trouble.

01:16:34.165 --> 01:16:35.165
Where are we?

01:16:36.565 --> 01:16:37.765
Officially?

01:16:40.165 --> 01:16:42.735
RAM site operations facility.

01:16:43.905 --> 01:16:45.305
Never heard of it.

01:16:45.305 --> 01:16:47.005
It's because it doesn't exist.

01:16:47.675 --> 01:16:48.915
What about my friends?

01:16:48.915 --> 01:16:50.745
Where are they?

01:16:50.745 --> 01:16:54.755
Your friends are fine, except
for one who won't stop crying.

01:16:56.015 --> 01:17:00.385
Dallas, I'm going to need
to know what you know.

01:17:00.385 --> 01:17:01.855
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:17:02.955 --> 01:17:05.695
We know about your little
rendezvous with Walker.

01:17:06.865 --> 01:17:09.335
The one thing we don't
know is the location

01:17:09.335 --> 01:17:10.895
of the upcoming event.

01:17:10.895 --> 01:17:13.205
I'm going to need you
to fill me in on that.

01:17:13.205 --> 01:17:16.235
I also know you found the
device I asked you about.

01:17:16.235 --> 01:17:18.575
I need to know
what's on that too.

01:17:22.875 --> 01:17:23.875
Okay.

01:17:24.945 --> 01:17:26.785
Okay, I'm going to
level with you here.

01:17:28.055 --> 01:17:33.055
The device-- the thing
is, I don't have it.

01:17:33.055 --> 01:17:34.255
He took it.

01:17:35.555 --> 01:17:41.735
But if you let us out of here,
I promise you I will do my very

01:17:41.735 --> 01:17:44.765
best to not help you at all.

01:17:47.005 --> 01:17:48.005
Hey!

01:17:49.435 --> 01:17:52.275
You think you're the only one
that cared about your father?

01:17:53.605 --> 01:17:56.615
I was there with him
that day on the airplane!

01:17:57.515 --> 01:18:00.245
I lost my best friend, Dallas.

01:18:00.245 --> 01:18:02.915
I'm still trying to figure
out what happened that day.

01:18:04.185 --> 01:18:05.725
That's why I need you
to tell me what you

01:18:05.725 --> 01:18:08.225
know so that we can
make sure nothing

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:09.325
like that ever happens again.

01:18:09.325 --> 01:18:10.795
Do you understand me?

01:18:10.795 --> 01:18:12.995
Tell me you understand me!

01:18:12.995 --> 01:18:16.165
What do you think is
waiting for you out there--

01:18:16.165 --> 01:18:19.135
enlightenment, peaceful contact?

01:18:20.935 --> 01:18:22.475
What if you find what
you're looking for,

01:18:22.475 --> 01:18:24.575
Dallas, and it's bad news?

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:25.745
What then?

01:18:25.745 --> 01:18:28.515
According to Dr. Walker,
they may not all be bad.

01:18:28.515 --> 01:18:29.915
Possibly.

01:18:29.915 --> 01:18:33.245
But they are gods,
Dallas, and they

01:18:33.245 --> 01:18:34.955
can crush us in an instant.

01:18:35.955 --> 01:18:39.285
They are only good if it
serves their interest.

01:18:41.525 --> 01:18:44.495
Walker is leading
you into disaster.

01:18:44.495 --> 01:18:47.225
Walker is the only one
being honest with me.

01:18:49.065 --> 01:18:50.295
Honest?

01:18:50.295 --> 01:18:52.205
Walker?

01:18:52.205 --> 01:18:53.605
He's not your friend, Dallas.

01:18:53.605 --> 01:18:55.635
He's the furthest thing from it.

01:18:56.535 --> 01:18:58.275
Ask him why he's on the run.

01:18:58.275 --> 01:19:03.645
Better yet, ask him what
happened to your father.

01:19:03.645 --> 01:19:05.485
See what happens there.

01:19:05.485 --> 01:19:06.985
He already told
me what happened.

01:19:08.155 --> 01:19:09.955
No, I don't think so.

01:19:09.955 --> 01:19:12.355
Ask him what really
happened to your father.

01:19:13.255 --> 01:19:15.625
You want honesty from me?

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:17.695
I don't need to tell
you any of this.

01:19:18.725 --> 01:19:21.225
Because this thing
is bigger than you.

01:19:21.225 --> 01:19:23.395
It's bigger than me.
It's bigger than all of us.

01:19:24.505 --> 01:19:26.165
Come on, Jim.

01:19:26.165 --> 01:19:27.235
Just let us go.

01:19:27.235 --> 01:19:28.275
This is so fucking stupid.

01:19:29.575 --> 01:19:31.175
You can't hide nature.

01:19:31.175 --> 01:19:35.215
Whatever this turns out to
be, it's how the universe is.

01:19:35.215 --> 01:19:38.745
We can't hide reality, man.

01:19:38.745 --> 01:19:40.845
Well, I'm not going
to let you do this.

01:19:41.585 --> 01:19:43.015
I already lost your father.

01:19:44.085 --> 01:19:46.855
I'm not going to let you
go down the same path.

01:19:48.055 --> 01:19:50.795
So if you're not going
to tell me anything,

01:19:52.725 --> 01:19:57.765
then I guess we'll never know.

01:20:04.705 --> 01:20:06.245
Or we can do this the hard way.

01:20:30.565 --> 01:20:31.765
Dallas.

01:20:31.765 --> 01:20:34.305
Oh, my God, I was so
worried about you.

01:20:34.305 --> 01:20:35.405
I'm fine.

01:20:36.335 --> 01:20:38.545
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:20:38.545 --> 01:20:40.275
All right, you guys,
everything cool?

01:20:40.275 --> 01:20:41.545
Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:42.645
Yeah, we're good.

01:20:42.645 --> 01:20:44.045
Is he still crying?

01:20:44.045 --> 01:20:44.915
Yeah.

01:20:44.915 --> 01:20:46.385
He's-- he's been
crying for awhile.

01:20:46.385 --> 01:20:47.785
I'm sorry, I'm emotional.

01:20:48.755 --> 01:20:51.385
But I did sneak my
phone in my underwear.

01:20:51.385 --> 01:20:54.125
Now, I don't know if I'm
getting a signal in here,

01:20:54.125 --> 01:20:57.325
but I have been getting
some notifications.

01:20:57.325 --> 01:20:58.425
It keeps vibrating.

01:21:02.695 --> 01:21:04.435
What did Myers say?

01:21:05.765 --> 01:21:07.605
He asked about the landing.

01:21:07.605 --> 01:21:08.675
Did you tell him I know.

01:21:08.675 --> 01:21:10.235
No.

01:21:10.235 --> 01:21:11.275
Good.

01:21:11.275 --> 01:21:12.905
How is that good?

01:21:12.905 --> 01:21:14.345
How is any of this good?

01:21:14.345 --> 01:21:18.585
Because it means the event
is still secret with us.

01:21:18.585 --> 01:21:19.845
It buys us time.

01:21:20.885 --> 01:21:22.415
Look, Dallas, there are options.

01:21:22.415 --> 01:21:24.315
There are ways out.

01:21:24.315 --> 01:21:25.355
I just got to think.

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:27.955
Hey kid, give me your phone.

01:21:29.525 --> 01:21:31.665
Fine. It might
smell a bit weird.

01:21:31.665 --> 01:21:32.895
Just give it to me.

01:21:36.295 --> 01:21:38.135
What the hell?

01:21:38.135 --> 01:21:43.105
Sorry, I just needed a
little piece of metal--

01:21:43.105 --> 01:21:46.405
something short and
skinny to open the lock.

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:48.545
Hey, hold on.

01:21:48.545 --> 01:21:49.945
What?

01:21:49.945 --> 01:21:51.175
I don't trust you.

01:21:51.645 --> 01:21:52.945
What?

01:21:52.945 --> 01:21:55.155
Look, we went to your shack
because you said you were

01:21:55.155 --> 01:21:56.655
going to tell me about my dad.

01:21:56.655 --> 01:21:57.725
Right?

01:21:57.725 --> 01:21:58.985
If I'm going to
keep following you,

01:21:58.985 --> 01:22:00.125
I'm going to need
some answers, man.

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:01.455
Okay.
What is it, Dallas?

01:22:01.455 --> 01:22:02.825
What would you like to know?

01:22:03.525 --> 01:22:04.825
Why are you on the run?

01:22:07.195 --> 01:22:08.735
I see that you and
Myers talked about

01:22:08.735 --> 01:22:10.535
something other than locations.

01:22:10.535 --> 01:22:12.505
Come on, it's a
simple question!

01:22:12.505 --> 01:22:18.235
Simple questions don't
always mean simple answers.

01:22:18.235 --> 01:22:19.405
Then start talking.

01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:25.585
The agency and I have
a fundamental difference

01:22:25.585 --> 01:22:26.915
of opinion.

01:22:26.915 --> 01:22:28.815
You satisfied?

01:22:28.815 --> 01:22:30.655
No, not at all.

01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:32.255
Then I'll make
it easy for you.

01:22:32.255 --> 01:22:35.525
The agency feels that the
average man can't handle

01:22:35.525 --> 01:22:37.325
the complexity of all of this--

01:22:37.325 --> 01:22:39.895
that they're going to screw
up everything beyond belief.

01:22:39.895 --> 01:22:43.695
They feel that only the
elite, the most educated,

01:22:43.695 --> 01:22:45.335
the most benevolent
should be in charge--

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:47.905
those should be the
ones in control.

01:22:47.905 --> 01:22:50.035
Yeah, that makes
sense like 60 years ago.

01:22:50.035 --> 01:22:52.105
But why keep it a secret now?

01:22:52.105 --> 01:22:54.375
Because it was the
right thing to do then.

01:22:55.415 --> 01:23:00.215
All programs will rot from
within after 60 years.

01:23:00.215 --> 01:23:01.715
Well, why did
Myers make it seem

01:23:01.715 --> 01:23:03.855
like you were the bad guy here?

01:23:03.855 --> 01:23:07.225
Because Myers is terrified
of what he doesn't know.

01:23:07.225 --> 01:23:09.855
He's like an overgrown infant.

01:23:09.855 --> 01:23:11.355
But the agency, you
know, they trust him.

01:23:11.355 --> 01:23:14.895
They don't blame him because
he's saving lives, isn't he?

01:23:15.835 --> 01:23:17.065
And what about you?

01:23:17.065 --> 01:23:18.365
You're fine in all this?

01:23:18.365 --> 01:23:21.235
How do you cope so easily
if it's all so terrifying?

01:23:21.235 --> 01:23:22.735
Cope!

01:23:22.735 --> 01:23:24.305
What are you fucking kidding me?

01:23:24.305 --> 01:23:25.645
Cope!

01:23:25.645 --> 01:23:29.115
I'm scared out of
my wits, Dallas.

01:23:29.115 --> 01:23:33.545
The fundamental difference is I
wish to understand that which I

01:23:33.545 --> 01:23:35.555
do not know, and
I will sacrifice

01:23:35.555 --> 01:23:39.655
myself so that the people of
the world might understand.

01:23:42.655 --> 01:23:45.665
Listen, Dallas, you and I, we
haven't known each other long,

01:23:45.665 --> 01:23:48.595
but I have a feeling that
we're cut from the same cloth.

01:23:50.135 --> 01:23:51.465
And I know your dad.

01:23:53.865 --> 01:23:55.135
Do you trust me?

01:23:58.005 --> 01:24:00.345
Can I take you someplace
tonight and show you

01:24:00.345 --> 01:24:03.515
something that will
absolutely change your world?

01:24:15.325 --> 01:24:16.355
Okay.

01:24:26.865 --> 01:24:28.775
It's unlocked.

01:24:28.775 --> 01:24:30.375
What do you mean
it's unlocked?

01:24:31.375 --> 01:24:32.605
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

01:24:32.605 --> 01:24:33.945
It's not locked.
It's open.

01:24:33.945 --> 01:24:35.145
It's ajar.

01:24:35.815 --> 01:24:37.975
What about my phone?

01:24:37.975 --> 01:24:40.685
Oh, I broke it.

01:24:46.685 --> 01:24:48.595
Toe, let's go.
Let's go.

01:25:06.245 --> 01:25:07.915
Perfect.

01:25:07.915 --> 01:25:09.445
Now, let's see
where they take us.

01:25:12.585 --> 01:25:13.685
All right.

01:25:14.785 --> 01:25:16.215
QUIET. OKAY?

01:25:28.695 --> 01:25:29.695
All right, hurry through.

01:25:29.695 --> 01:25:31.905
This is not a place you
want to stick around.

01:25:48.485 --> 01:25:49.555
Ah!

01:25:51.085 --> 01:25:52.555
Toe, let's go!

01:25:55.825 --> 01:25:57.255
Do you even know
where you're going?

01:25:57.255 --> 01:25:58.355
Of course I know
where I'm going.

01:25:58.355 --> 01:25:59.465
I practically built the place.

01:25:59.465 --> 01:26:02.535
Guys, I just saw
actual space creature.

01:26:02.535 --> 01:26:04.535
Like, real fucking
aliens back there.

01:26:04.535 --> 01:26:07.575
All right. All right.
Just contain yourself.

01:26:07.575 --> 01:26:09.135
Okay. It's always scary
the first time.

01:26:09.135 --> 01:26:11.045
But people can handle it.

01:26:11.045 --> 01:26:12.205
You can handle it.

01:26:12.205 --> 01:26:13.545
Just think of it it's
another life form.

01:26:13.545 --> 01:26:15.975
It's like seeing a squid
for the first time, Okay?

01:26:15.975 --> 01:26:17.045
All right?

01:26:17.045 --> 01:26:18.585
Just contain yourself, Okay?

01:26:18.585 --> 01:26:19.615
Let's go.

01:26:24.255 --> 01:26:25.825
Well, which way is it?

01:26:25.825 --> 01:26:27.255
Just give me a second.

01:26:27.255 --> 01:26:28.895
You don't remember?

01:26:28.895 --> 01:26:29.995
Of course I remember.

01:26:29.995 --> 01:26:31.725
Hey, I am high.

01:26:31.725 --> 01:26:33.425
Get your shit together.

01:26:34.795 --> 01:26:35.965
How dare you.

01:26:35.965 --> 01:26:37.135
Cry about it.

01:26:37.135 --> 01:26:38.395
Maybe I will.

01:26:38.395 --> 01:26:39.405
Jesus, Toe.

01:26:39.405 --> 01:26:40.805
Shut the fuck up and
let's get out of here!

01:26:40.805 --> 01:26:41.905
Guys, guys, guys
we have to go.

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:43.105
Let's go.

01:26:52.285 --> 01:26:54.455
Oh shit, there's a guard.

01:27:00.995 --> 01:27:03.095
Okay, there's only one of him.

01:27:03.095 --> 01:27:04.255
Okay? Just stand your ground.

01:27:04.255 --> 01:27:06.295
We gotta get the key
out of his pocket.

01:27:10.295 --> 01:27:11.865
Hey Toe, get back here.

01:27:11.865 --> 01:27:12.935
No, it's all good.

01:27:12.935 --> 01:27:14.435
I'm going to pickpocket the key.

01:27:14.435 --> 01:27:16.505
You're horrible
at pickpocketing!

01:27:16.505 --> 01:27:17.375
Get back here.

01:27:17.375 --> 01:27:19.605
No, I'm great at it.
You taught me.

01:27:19.605 --> 01:27:20.675
We're dead.

01:27:20.675 --> 01:27:21.615
Fuck.

01:27:21.615 --> 01:27:23.715
- He's going to kill us.
- Piece of shit.

01:27:26.085 --> 01:27:27.715
Hey.

01:27:27.715 --> 01:27:28.955
I'm Brian.

01:27:28.955 --> 01:27:30.115
I'm the new IT guy.

01:27:30.115 --> 01:27:31.285
I know we didn't
get a chance to meet

01:27:31.285 --> 01:27:33.385
at the orientation or anything.

01:27:33.385 --> 01:27:36.155
But anyway, there's
no easy way for me

01:27:36.155 --> 01:27:38.225
to say this-- basically,
all the IT guys,

01:27:38.225 --> 01:27:41.465
they know about the downloads.

01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:43.965
And, uh, you know, you're not
supposed to have that stuff

01:27:43.965 --> 01:27:45.365
on government property.

01:27:45.365 --> 01:27:47.635
Okay, you dirty, dirty dog.

01:27:47.635 --> 01:27:50.305
But I won't give you
a hard time about it.

01:27:50.305 --> 01:27:53.345
If I can just see your phone,
I won't tell you supervisor.

01:27:53.345 --> 01:27:54.545
Man, who the fuck are you?

01:27:54.545 --> 01:27:56.015
- I'm no one.
- How'd you get in here?

01:27:56.015 --> 01:27:57.415
- I'm-- I'm--
- How'd you get in here?

01:27:57.415 --> 01:27:58.685
Hey!

01:28:00.545 --> 01:28:01.585
Get his keys.

01:28:01.585 --> 01:28:02.755
Come on, guys.

01:28:02.755 --> 01:28:03.785
Let's get to the tarmac.

01:28:16.535 --> 01:28:17.835
Something doesn't seem right.

01:28:17.835 --> 01:28:19.035
This is too easy.

01:28:19.035 --> 01:28:21.005
But just lay low, Okay?

01:28:21.005 --> 01:28:22.435
We've got to get out of here.

01:28:22.435 --> 01:28:23.475
Come on.

01:28:27.045 --> 01:28:28.445
Oh, my God.

01:28:33.885 --> 01:28:35.185
Is that what I think it is?

01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:36.515
Holy shit.

01:28:36.515 --> 01:28:38.585
Have they reverse
engineered it yet?

01:28:38.585 --> 01:28:39.585
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:39.585 --> 01:28:41.355
They've been working
on that since the '60s.

01:28:41.355 --> 01:28:42.755
I thought Roswell
was in the '40s.

01:28:42.755 --> 01:28:43.855
It was in the '40s.

01:28:43.855 --> 01:28:45.795
Then two decades later,
they started work on that.

01:28:45.795 --> 01:28:47.465
And then they started
work on this thing

01:28:47.465 --> 01:28:50.195
called the Locust
in the early 2000s.

01:28:50.195 --> 01:28:51.435
Come on. Come on.

01:29:00.275 --> 01:29:01.915
There's a vehicle over there.

01:29:01.915 --> 01:29:02.975
That's going to be our escape.

01:29:03.775 --> 01:29:04.945
I'll drive.

01:29:04.945 --> 01:29:06.385
No, you suck at
driving, asshole.

01:29:06.385 --> 01:29:08.285
- Fuck off, I'm in charge.
- You're too high.

01:29:08.285 --> 01:29:09.615
You're going to drive
at 5 miles per hour.

01:29:09.615 --> 01:29:11.425
You know I always drive
considerately when I'm high.

01:29:11.425 --> 01:29:12.925
Shut up. Everyone, shut up.

01:29:12.925 --> 01:29:13.985
- Are you high?
- Yes.

01:29:13.985 --> 01:29:15.325
You drive.

01:29:33.245 --> 01:29:34.575
Oh, God.
Go.

01:29:34.575 --> 01:29:35.915
I got it.

01:29:35.915 --> 01:29:37.615
Go! Go!
Go! Go!

01:29:39.985 --> 01:29:41.255
Look out.
Look out.

01:29:41.255 --> 01:29:42.285
No, Toe, stop!

01:29:42.285 --> 01:29:43.355
They've got guns.

01:29:43.355 --> 01:29:44.685
Toe, you have to turn!

01:29:44.685 --> 01:29:45.855
Stop yelling at me!

01:29:45.855 --> 01:29:47.755
Toe, you suck at driving!

01:29:47.755 --> 01:29:49.925
Put your seat belt on.

01:29:49.925 --> 01:29:51.495
Hey!
- Oh, my God.

01:29:54.465 --> 01:29:56.035
- You're going to hit them!
- No!

01:29:56.035 --> 01:29:57.565
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

01:29:58.365 --> 01:29:59.435
Stop!
Stop!

01:29:59.435 --> 01:30:00.965
Stop!
Stop!

01:30:38.275 --> 01:30:40.845
Are you an idiot, Toe?

01:31:05.735 --> 01:31:07.665
I've called him
over 10 times, Myron.

01:31:07.665 --> 01:31:08.905
He's not returning my calls.

01:31:08.905 --> 01:31:09.775
I don't understand.

01:31:09.775 --> 01:31:11.445
He probably hasn't
checked his phone.

01:31:11.445 --> 01:31:12.505
He's probably--

01:31:12.505 --> 01:31:13.575
He always has his phone.

01:31:13.575 --> 01:31:14.845
Maybe he doesn't have service.

01:31:14.845 --> 01:31:15.845
Oh, please.

01:31:15.845 --> 01:31:17.675
Where would he be that
he doesn't have service?

01:31:17.675 --> 01:31:19.915
- I don't know.

01:31:29.495 --> 01:31:30.725
Yeah. We can't find Kelly,

01:31:30.725 --> 01:31:32.365
and we thought
she might be here.

01:31:32.365 --> 01:31:34.395
Oh, no. You too?

01:31:38.065 --> 01:31:39.235
Come on, Dallas.

01:31:39.235 --> 01:31:40.305
Faster!

01:31:40.305 --> 01:31:41.535
We don't have much time.

01:31:41.535 --> 01:31:43.735
I'm going as fast as I can!

01:31:48.075 --> 01:31:49.845
Oh shit, it's my mom.

01:31:50.515 --> 01:31:51.585
God, she keeps calling.

01:31:51.585 --> 01:31:52.885
I can't talk right now.

01:31:52.885 --> 01:31:53.715
Just answer it.

01:31:53.715 --> 01:31:55.055
- Are you serious?
- Yes! Answer it!

01:31:55.055 --> 01:31:56.455
God damn. Hi, Mom.

01:31:56.455 --> 01:31:57.885
Not a great time right now.

01:31:57.885 --> 01:31:59.055
Oh Dallas, thank God.

01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:00.285
Is Kelly with you?

01:32:00.285 --> 01:32:02.755
You're never going to
believe what happened.

01:32:02.755 --> 01:32:05.125
Okay, listen, I have
Kelly's parents with me.

01:32:05.125 --> 01:32:07.225
I'm going to put
you on speakerphone.

01:32:07.225 --> 01:32:09.635
Dallas, you have to come home.

01:32:09.635 --> 01:32:10.495
Now!

01:32:10.495 --> 01:32:11.905
We saw a real live alien.

01:32:13.405 --> 01:32:14.905
What? What?

01:32:14.905 --> 01:32:16.105
We tied up this--

01:32:17.905 --> 01:32:20.245
Wait. Wait, you're breaking up.
We can't hear you.

01:32:20.245 --> 01:32:21.315
There were lots of--

01:32:22.575 --> 01:32:24.745
We tried to hit
him in the dick.

01:32:24.745 --> 01:32:27.185
I think Dallas's
dick is handcuffed.

01:32:27.185 --> 01:32:28.255
In the cock.

01:32:28.255 --> 01:32:29.485
Hey. Hey. Hey.
That's your mother.

01:32:29.485 --> 01:32:30.855
I think she's
with sex addicts.

01:32:30.855 --> 01:32:32.885
- What are you talking about?

01:32:37.625 --> 01:32:39.825
Whiskey, Tango, Mayo.

01:32:41.895 --> 01:32:44.195
Listen up, this
is Captain Myers.

01:32:44.195 --> 01:32:47.465
I don't have much
time, so listen up.

01:32:47.465 --> 01:32:50.005
Soldiers, this is an order.

01:32:50.005 --> 01:32:52.975
I want you to look at
the man next to you.

01:32:52.975 --> 01:32:58.615
Love that motherfucker, and
then slowly take him inside--

01:32:58.615 --> 01:33:00.185
Get this motherfucker
off the radio.

01:33:00.185 --> 01:33:01.515
Shift to secondary.

01:33:03.815 --> 01:33:05.555
What the fuck are
you laughing at?

01:33:23.435 --> 01:33:27.875
Guys, no matter what
happens, you stay calm.

01:33:27.875 --> 01:33:28.915
Okay?

01:33:37.585 --> 01:33:38.855
What the hell?

01:33:40.685 --> 01:33:42.025
Do you guys feel that?

01:34:05.285 --> 01:34:06.285
What's that?

01:34:21.565 --> 01:34:22.995
Dallas, what are you doing?

01:34:37.115 --> 01:34:38.715
Dallas, no!

01:34:38.715 --> 01:34:40.315
He was called here.

01:34:40.315 --> 01:34:41.755
This is his experience.

01:34:43.985 --> 01:34:45.085
Fuck.

01:34:45.085 --> 01:34:46.155
Well, what do we do?

01:34:53.825 --> 01:34:55.195
All right, I'm going
to buy some time.

01:34:57.095 --> 01:34:58.105
You guys go.

01:34:58.105 --> 01:34:59.165
Go-- go be with him.

01:34:59.165 --> 01:35:00.965
You, come-- come-- come here.

01:35:00.965 --> 01:35:02.035
Come here.

01:35:03.505 --> 01:35:05.105
You give this to Dallas, Okay?

01:35:06.105 --> 01:35:07.105
You promise me.

01:35:07.105 --> 01:35:08.175
- Okay.
- Okay, go.

01:35:08.175 --> 01:35:09.315
- Go.
- Yeah.

01:35:19.285 --> 01:35:20.325
Move out.

01:35:21.495 --> 01:35:22.595
Check the perimeter.

01:35:22.595 --> 01:35:24.055
Let's go.
Let's go.

01:35:24.525 --> 01:35:25.795
Threats inbound.

01:35:26.325 --> 01:35:27.495
Shadow 1, air defense.

01:35:27.495 --> 01:35:29.135
Bogey at starboard.
2 o'clock high.

01:35:29.135 --> 01:35:30.335
Call the visual. Over.

01:35:35.005 --> 01:35:38.175
Sir, we have two F-18s
inbound on intercept.

01:35:38.175 --> 01:35:39.505
We have them on comms now.

01:35:39.505 --> 01:35:40.615
Record everything.

01:35:40.615 --> 01:35:41.815
Copy that.

01:35:42.475 --> 01:35:44.015
Jim, what are you doing?

01:35:44.015 --> 01:35:45.615
They're just kids.

01:35:45.615 --> 01:35:47.785
Put away your guns.

01:35:47.785 --> 01:35:51.155
These are adversaries
we know very little about.

01:35:51.155 --> 01:35:54.325
Jim, You and I both know
they're more powerful,

01:35:54.325 --> 01:35:56.055
and we can't win.

01:35:56.055 --> 01:35:58.125
We have to use the
weapons we have--

01:35:58.125 --> 01:36:01.665
free will, morality, consciousness.

01:36:03.365 --> 01:36:05.035
Jesus, Jim.

01:36:05.035 --> 01:36:07.135
We've been fighting
this for 70 years,

01:36:07.135 --> 01:36:08.375
and nothing's come of it.

01:36:10.405 --> 01:36:12.075
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:36:17.675 --> 01:36:19.315
<i>Whenever
somebody has an experience</i>

01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:23.015
<i>like I had, it's hard for them
to understand why they can't</i>

01:36:23.015 --> 01:36:25.825
<i>remember every specific detail.</i>

01:36:25.825 --> 01:36:30.895
<i>You have glimpses, feelings,
and knowing within,</i>

01:36:30.895 --> 01:36:33.165
<i>but it's hard to explain.</i>

01:36:33.165 --> 01:36:38.735
<i>And when you do, it kind of
sounds absurd, like trying</i>

01:36:38.735 --> 01:36:40.805
<i>to explain a bizarre dream.</i>

01:37:50.605 --> 01:37:54.145
<i>All possibilities
are layered within
different waves of energy,</i>

01:37:54.145 --> 01:37:58.075
<i>and our mind is the only
thing that can make them real.</i>

01:37:58.075 --> 01:38:01.455
<i>So if everything is happening
right on top of each other,</i>

01:38:01.455 --> 01:38:04.855
<i>forces of nature can cause
them to bleed into one another.</i>

01:38:05.625 --> 01:38:07.925
<i>Sometimes that's a good thing.</i>

01:38:07.925 --> 01:38:10.255
<i>Sometimes it's not.</i>

01:38:10.255 --> 01:38:13.925
<i>And sometimes, machines are
even used to interfere with us,</i>

01:38:13.925 --> 01:38:16.365
<i>and that's not good at all.</i>

01:38:16.365 --> 01:38:20.205
<i>But if you could calm your
mind, choose love over hate,</i>

01:38:20.205 --> 01:38:22.875
<i>you will connect to
the right frequency.</i>

01:38:24.305 --> 01:38:28.175
<i>Because if we don't,
if we tune in to darkness</i>

01:38:28.175 --> 01:38:31.985
<i>and give in to fear, someone
else will create a reality here</i>

01:38:31.985 --> 01:38:33.985
<i>that suits them and not us.</i>

01:38:36.155 --> 01:38:37.855
<i>So it really
doesn't matter if we</i>

01:38:37.855 --> 01:38:39.785
<i>call ourselves
Christian, Muslim,</i>

01:38:39.785 --> 01:38:42.225
<i>atheist, or just dreamers--</i>

01:38:43.995 --> 01:38:48.495
<i>that boxes you in and
misses the point entirely.</i>

01:38:50.095 --> 01:38:51.165
Dallas!

01:38:52.335 --> 01:38:53.335
Dallas.

01:38:53.835 --> 01:38:55.205
Hey, I got you.

01:38:55.205 --> 01:38:56.335
You're okay.

01:38:56.335 --> 01:38:57.475
Come on.

01:38:57.475 --> 01:38:58.845
You all right?

01:39:00.675 --> 01:39:01.975
It's all right.

01:39:01.975 --> 01:39:03.345
Let's get him out of here.

01:39:34.545 --> 01:39:35.545
You okay?

01:39:37.415 --> 01:39:39.985
Yeah, I think so.

01:39:41.485 --> 01:39:43.185
What you did--

01:39:43.185 --> 01:39:45.425
walking towards that craft--

01:39:45.425 --> 01:39:46.585
took courage.

01:39:48.725 --> 01:39:50.925
It was probably a
stupid thing to do.

01:39:52.325 --> 01:39:57.235
Whatever it was, it was a once
in a lifetime kind of thing,

01:39:57.235 --> 01:39:59.205
you know?

01:39:59.205 --> 01:40:04.075
Look, uh, I'm going to need
you to keep quiet about this.

01:40:05.145 --> 01:40:06.405
You going to be good with that?

01:40:08.615 --> 01:40:10.045
Yeah.

01:40:10.045 --> 01:40:11.315
I'm cool with that.

01:40:14.585 --> 01:40:16.885
You're a good man, Dallas.

01:40:16.885 --> 01:40:18.425
Everything's going
to be all right.

01:40:19.425 --> 01:40:20.455
Hey, Jim?

01:40:22.255 --> 01:40:25.365
Do you think my dad would
have done what I did tonight?

01:40:30.095 --> 01:40:31.395
I know he would have.

01:40:31.395 --> 01:40:34.675
I know this because I saw
him do it with my own eyes.

01:40:37.705 --> 01:40:39.505
He was the bravest man I knew.

01:40:42.775 --> 01:40:44.445
And he talked about
you all the time.

01:40:46.345 --> 01:40:47.345
He loved you.

01:41:03.695 --> 01:41:04.705
See you soon.

01:41:16.375 --> 01:41:19.445
Bet you guys think
this is pretty crazy.

01:41:19.445 --> 01:41:23.615
Let me tell you, I have
had the gnarliest week

01:41:23.615 --> 01:41:25.955
I've ever had in my life.

01:41:25.955 --> 01:41:27.825
You want to know about the shit?

01:41:27.825 --> 01:41:29.395
I can tell you about the shit.

01:42:00.285 --> 01:42:05.595
You know, this was
like the best date ever.

01:42:08.695 --> 01:42:10.195
Are you calling
this a date now?

01:42:11.965 --> 01:42:13.205
I'll let you know.

01:42:19.305 --> 01:42:20.345
Dallas.

01:42:23.945 --> 01:42:25.145
Come here.

01:42:26.385 --> 01:42:27.415
Woo!

01:42:28.655 --> 01:42:29.915
You good?

01:42:29.915 --> 01:42:31.025
Yeah.

01:42:31.025 --> 01:42:32.285
Oh, my God.

01:42:33.225 --> 01:42:37.695
Okay, Dr. Walker had to go.

01:42:37.695 --> 01:42:39.725
But he-- he gave me this.

01:42:41.765 --> 01:42:43.065
It might be about your dad.

01:42:49.935 --> 01:42:51.235
He did it.

01:42:54.445 --> 01:42:55.375
Thanks.

01:42:55.375 --> 01:42:56.815
- We did it.
- We did it.

01:42:56.815 --> 01:42:58.075
We did it.

01:42:59.545 --> 01:43:00.615
All right.

01:43:00.615 --> 01:43:02.085
Now, where the hell is Toe?

01:43:02.085 --> 01:43:04.585
I discovered Bigfoot.

01:43:04.585 --> 01:43:05.655
I did that.

01:43:05.655 --> 01:43:06.725
I was the first to do that.

01:43:06.725 --> 01:43:10.195
And I'll save you all
the trouble, it sucked.

01:43:10.925 --> 01:43:12.665
It was absolutely--

01:43:30.215 --> 01:43:31.785
Oh. Okay, thanks.

01:43:32.815 --> 01:43:35.145
<i>There's a lot
we've been afraid of.</i>

01:43:36.455 --> 01:43:39.785
<i>We kept secrets from each other
based on fear of the unknown.</i>

01:43:41.055 --> 01:43:43.825
<i>But I've always thought there
was a bright side to all this.</i>

01:43:46.295 --> 01:43:49.335
<i>At the end of the day,
what if we learn that we</i>

01:43:49.335 --> 01:43:51.235
<i>all come from the same place?</i>

01:43:52.865 --> 01:43:55.875
<i>Like, one vast field of energy?</i>

01:43:55.875 --> 01:43:58.645
<i>Because that may be what all
these events are truly about.</i>

01:44:00.645 --> 01:44:04.815
<i>As for me, I saw an opportunity
to change up the status quo.</i>

01:44:06.385 --> 01:44:08.555
<i>Yeah, I've pissed off a few
people in the government</i>

01:44:08.555 --> 01:44:11.985
<i>along the way, but I took a risk
knowing it was the right thing</i>

01:44:11.985 --> 01:44:13.225
<i>to do at the time.</i>

01:44:14.725 --> 01:44:17.965
<i>We're not alone,
and the government</i>

01:44:17.965 --> 01:44:20.195
<i>knows a hell of a lot
more than they're saying.</i>

01:44:24.065 --> 01:44:27.235
<i>But guess what,
we don't need them.</i>

01:44:29.235 --> 01:44:31.205
<i>These visitors have
been here for thousands</i>

01:44:31.205 --> 01:44:34.845
<i>of years, for all of us to see.</i>

01:45:09.715 --> 01:45:15.385
<i>So if you're wondering, how have
we missed all this happening</i>

01:45:15.385 --> 01:45:21.285
<i>around us for so long,
we haven't.</i>
