A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:29.525 --> 01:30.765
What are you doing?

01:31.325 --> 01:32.645
Huh?

01:32.725 --> 01:33.725
What...

01:34.445 --> 01:35.605
Lele, stop.

01:36.525 --> 01:37.845
Lele, listen to Daddy.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.925
Put down the gun.
Put it on the floor. Put it down.

01:41.285 --> 01:42.885
Tell me where she went.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.165
Daddy doesn't know where Mommy is.

01:51.965 --> 01:53.125
Put the gun down.

01:54.445 --> 01:57.365
I want to know the truth.
Tell me where she went.

01:58.245 --> 02:01.965
-I don't want to hear any more lies.
-No, Daddy won't lie to you.

02:02.045 --> 02:04.525
It... It's just hard to explain it to you.
Understand?

02:05.605 --> 02:07.605
Mommy doesn't like lies.

02:09.525 --> 02:11.325
But I told one anyway.

02:11.885 --> 02:13.085
And she left.

02:28.285 --> 02:29.365
Come here.

02:29.445 --> 02:31.125
It's not your fault.

02:32.445 --> 02:33.645
It's only my fault.

02:57.605 --> 02:59.925
Samurai asked you to kill Tullio Adami.

03:02.925 --> 03:04.685
This confession will turn Rome
on its head.

03:08.245 --> 03:10.205
It's time everyone knew the truth.

03:13.805 --> 03:15.765
There'll be huge consequences.

03:18.245 --> 03:20.685
You know
what happens to cops in jail, right?

03:22.445 --> 03:23.565
Are you sure?

03:27.365 --> 03:29.125
It's the right thing to do.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.965
Thank you, Doctor.

03:54.445 --> 03:55.805
Are you okay?

04:04.005 --> 04:05.005
Hey.

04:06.285 --> 04:07.325
Thanks.

04:08.525 --> 04:09.645
Don't mention it.

04:19.725 --> 04:21.365
Look, Cinaglia hasn't won yet.

04:25.844 --> 04:27.005
Yeah, I know.

04:28.125 --> 04:29.325
What happens if he wins?

04:33.165 --> 04:34.405
Will they take you out?

04:34.845 --> 04:37.085
You were always quick on the uptake.

04:38.725 --> 04:42.325
When I knew you as a kid,
you already spoke like an adult.

04:44.005 --> 04:45.725
Do you remember what they called you?

04:46.325 --> 04:47.765
The philosopher.

04:49.325 --> 04:50.725
You could have stayed.

04:53.765 --> 04:55.605
I didn't leave.

04:55.685 --> 04:57.925
You're the one who left. For money.

04:58.805 --> 05:01.965
To get in with the same people
that now want to kill you.

05:13.965 --> 05:17.325
If you don't come up with something,
Cinaglia will become Deputy Mayor tonight.

05:26.245 --> 05:30.125
...was found a few meters
from where Mass was being celebrated...

05:30.205 --> 05:31.325
-Hi, Amedeo.
-Hi.

05:31.405 --> 05:34.005
...the body of Countess Sveva
Della Rocca Croce.

05:34.085 --> 05:38.365
It appears to have been a tragic accident.

05:38.445 --> 05:41.525
A sudden turn of bad health
seems to have led to a fall,

05:41.605 --> 05:44.645
causing the woman
to hit her head against a rock

05:44.725 --> 05:47.405
and as a consequence
immediately losing consciousness...

05:58.005 --> 06:01.485
-Why aren't you answering your phone?
-What did you do, Amedeo?

06:01.965 --> 06:03.565
Alice, I'm sorry.

06:11.925 --> 06:13.805
I told you to stay at the hotel, didn't I?

06:14.365 --> 06:16.285
I didn't want to get you involved.

06:18.405 --> 06:20.245
What the fuck did you do, Amedeo?

06:22.925 --> 06:25.645
I did what I had to do
to win this election.

06:26.365 --> 06:27.485
I did it for us.

06:28.325 --> 06:29.925
What the fuck are you talking about?

06:32.925 --> 06:34.125
Who are you?

06:38.485 --> 06:41.165
It's easy to watch from a distance
and play dumb, isn't it?

06:41.245 --> 06:42.765
But now you know.

06:42.845 --> 06:45.365
Now you know
what I'm prepared to do to win.

06:45.885 --> 06:47.525
You drove me to this.

06:55.245 --> 06:56.765
Have you read the newspapers?

06:58.725 --> 07:00.565
They're talking about an accident.

07:01.525 --> 07:03.405
You haven't won the election yet.

07:24.405 --> 07:28.405
-Why haven't you taken sides yet?
-I'll only do what's good for the Church.

07:28.485 --> 07:30.805
A good that transcends
what's good for you or me.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.285
What does that mean?

07:33.005 --> 07:36.005
You kill those who get in your way.

07:36.085 --> 07:38.365
First Giunti, then the Countess.

07:39.085 --> 07:40.805
I'm not going to take sides.

07:41.605 --> 07:42.725
I'm not afraid of you.

07:42.805 --> 07:44.445
What are you talking about, Your Eminence?

07:44.525 --> 07:46.645
Don't play dumb with me.

07:46.725 --> 07:50.285
You are an evil blight on this city
and on the Church.

07:51.405 --> 07:52.725
From now on

07:52.805 --> 07:56.485
you will only find
locked doors at the Vatican.

07:56.565 --> 07:58.125
You can't do that.

07:58.205 --> 08:00.485
You were the first
to take advantage of my actions.

08:00.565 --> 08:03.405
Yes, but now I don't need them anymore.

08:03.485 --> 08:05.845
Do you really think you'll succeed?

08:05.925 --> 08:07.525
History says the opposite.

08:09.165 --> 08:11.205
History doesn't matter.

08:12.285 --> 08:14.245
What matters is the will of God.

08:36.285 --> 08:38.125
We're in charge now, Angelica.

08:46.205 --> 08:48.245
And we're beautiful.

08:58.365 --> 08:59.365
Caesar...

09:03.645 --> 09:05.845
Mom and Dad are building you an empire.

09:06.805 --> 09:09.325
Caesar? When did you decide that?

09:10.085 --> 09:12.605
Alberto Anacleti's son can't have
a name like Charlie.

09:16.125 --> 09:17.685
Caesar Anacleti.

09:51.645 --> 09:54.205
Come on, kids, move it
with those bumper boats.

09:56.725 --> 09:58.725
Quick, the ride's about to end.

10:07.645 --> 10:10.085
Christ, the amusement park's doing well.

10:21.525 --> 10:23.045
The stuff arrives today.

10:24.885 --> 10:26.405
I want you to take care of it.

10:31.085 --> 10:33.525
Did you hear what I said?
I want you to take care of it.

10:46.165 --> 10:50.045
Now, seeing as we're very happy today,
you've all won a free ride.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.605
Well done.
There you go. Great.

10:53.725 --> 10:55.885
This ugly guy with the beard is paying.

10:58.045 --> 10:59.805
It's the least you can do for me.

11:06.245 --> 11:09.165
Okay, now give these rides a rest.
There's work to do. Come on.

11:29.405 --> 11:31.485
We've got nothing more
to say to one another.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.285
Maybe you don't,
but I've got something to say.

11:34.365 --> 11:36.365
They killed the Countess.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.125
-It was an accident.
-No.

11:42.685 --> 11:44.605
Cinaglia ordered it.

11:44.685 --> 11:47.565
If word gets out,
the Right will take City Hall.

11:49.525 --> 11:51.365
I thought I made myself clear.

11:51.445 --> 11:53.565
I don't want to have
anything more to do with you.

11:55.165 --> 11:58.045
Just like I don't want to have
anything more to do with my ex-husband.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.565
-Without me you'll lose the election.
-No.

12:01.085 --> 12:02.685
We don't need you anymore.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.685
Every newspaper is reporting it
as an accident.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.165
If the Countess was murdered,
we'll know in a few days.

12:07.245 --> 12:08.805
And you can't change that.

12:09.565 --> 12:11.445
You've got nothing left to offer me.

12:11.525 --> 12:13.165
We'll win this election

12:13.245 --> 12:16.245
even without making shady deals
with people like you.

12:21.525 --> 12:23.445
So, where is he now?

12:24.085 --> 12:25.885
I don't know. We split up right after.

12:27.765 --> 12:29.205
But the problem now isn't Lele.

12:29.565 --> 12:32.845
Everyone is saying
the Countess's death was an accident.

12:33.445 --> 12:34.605
No one's talking about murder.

12:36.485 --> 12:40.365
-I did what I was supposed to do.
-Then what the fuck happened?

12:40.445 --> 12:43.205
People were supposed to think
she had been mugged and killed.

12:43.285 --> 12:45.245
That's what we needed
to win the election!

12:49.165 --> 12:51.445
Did you take her jewelry?
Did you steal her purse?

12:54.805 --> 12:55.805
-Did you take--
-No!

12:55.885 --> 12:57.925
Because your pain in the ass of a wife
showed up!

13:07.245 --> 13:08.285
What do we do now?

13:08.845 --> 13:11.445
-Your wife has to testify.
-What do you mean "testify"?

13:11.525 --> 13:13.925
She has to say
the Countess was killed by an immigrant.

13:14.005 --> 13:14.805
No.

13:15.645 --> 13:16.725
Not a chance.

13:18.485 --> 13:19.965
Amedeo, we haven't got a choice.

13:20.805 --> 13:23.165
You have to convince her. Now!

13:24.245 --> 13:27.165
It's the only way
we can get the news out in time.

13:28.885 --> 13:30.445
We can still win.

13:36.725 --> 13:38.285
We'll take several cars.

13:38.365 --> 13:41.405
Women will drive the ones with the stuff.
That way it'll be safer.

13:41.485 --> 13:44.085
We'll take different routes
and meet up there.

13:46.445 --> 13:48.605
-[in Sinti] [Let's go!]
-[Let's go!]

13:51.645 --> 13:53.645
So you've made a deal
with Aureliano Adami, huh?

13:55.925 --> 13:57.845
After he put Manfredi in a coma.

13:58.765 --> 14:00.765
Don't ask about things
that no longer concern you.

15:01.085 --> 15:03.045
What are my clothes doing in there?

15:04.565 --> 15:06.045
Did you take them from my place?

15:07.325 --> 15:10.845
-What do you mean?
-My clothes are in your room.

15:14.245 --> 15:16.205
-I was worried, Lele.
-Cut the bullshit.

15:16.765 --> 15:19.365
I heard what happened to Mara,
and you had disappeared.

15:19.445 --> 15:20.685
I was looking for you.

15:21.645 --> 15:24.085
Why didn't you tell me? Huh?

15:25.645 --> 15:29.565
And why the fuck are my clothes in there?
What were you going to do?

15:31.325 --> 15:32.485
All right.

15:34.325 --> 15:36.085
Mara and I investigated you.

15:36.885 --> 15:38.965
We found out about your links to Samurai.

15:39.445 --> 15:41.125
That he made you an inspector.

15:41.845 --> 15:43.165
That you work together.

15:44.125 --> 15:46.765
But I never intended to report you, Lele.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.605
That's not what I want.

15:52.405 --> 15:53.645
Introduce me to Samurai.

15:56.285 --> 15:58.485
I've had enough
of that shitty office, Lele.

15:59.845 --> 16:01.165
Nothing's ever going to change.

16:03.165 --> 16:05.045
You don't know what you're talking about.

16:07.445 --> 16:08.805
Then explain it to me.

16:10.325 --> 16:12.765
Because I've always done things honestly,

16:12.845 --> 16:14.205
by the book.

16:15.565 --> 16:17.165
And it hasn't gotten me anywhere.

16:18.805 --> 16:20.325
Well, if that's the game

16:22.085 --> 16:23.325
then I want to play too.

16:26.365 --> 16:27.365
No.

16:34.885 --> 16:36.325
I'm not asking, Lele.

16:41.325 --> 16:43.085
You'll ruin your life, you know that?

16:58.885 --> 17:01.245
-Welcome.
-We're doing it here?

17:23.285 --> 17:24.205
Nice work.

17:24.285 --> 17:25.565
Did you expect less?

17:29.245 --> 17:31.405
-How much have you got?
-Two cars full.

17:33.364 --> 17:34.365
Go get it all.

17:36.205 --> 17:37.805
Wait.

17:37.885 --> 17:40.845
Every plaza you deal, one of my people
has to be there to check on things.

17:41.445 --> 17:42.605
Don't you trust us?

17:43.405 --> 17:45.005
I can see you get me.

17:47.645 --> 17:50.765
Okay. You'll see, nothing will be missing
at the end of the night.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.405
Go ahead.

18:19.045 --> 18:20.045
Come on.

18:28.365 --> 18:30.045
I want to show you who I work with.

18:38.005 --> 18:40.565
Alice, I want you to go to the police.

18:41.325 --> 18:45.045
I want you to report what you saw.
Tell them that the Countess was murdered.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.885
That you were scared,
that they threatened you.

18:47.965 --> 18:50.765
And that she was killed by a refugee.

18:52.525 --> 18:54.125
And if I don't, what will you do?

18:58.405 --> 19:00.165
You're the mother of my children.

19:00.925 --> 19:02.325
You're my ally.

19:03.605 --> 19:06.205
You do this, and we win this election.

19:46.805 --> 19:48.525
So, how's the young lady doing?

19:51.045 --> 19:52.685
Thought it over?

19:52.765 --> 19:53.965
Changed your mind?

19:55.925 --> 19:59.165
If you don't tell me what you did
with Spadino, you'll die in here.

19:59.765 --> 20:00.965
Well?

20:01.045 --> 20:02.165
Got anything to say?

20:09.365 --> 20:10.365
There we are.

20:11.285 --> 20:12.325
Bravo.

20:18.045 --> 20:20.245
All our plazas in Ostia
have to be up and running again.

20:20.325 --> 20:21.565
How much stuff is there?

20:22.125 --> 20:23.125
A lot.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.725
Are we sure it's good quality?

20:25.805 --> 20:26.765
We're sure.

20:26.845 --> 20:28.245
Who's it from, the Gypsies?

20:29.885 --> 20:32.245
-Yes.
-The ones who killed my father?

20:33.405 --> 20:35.965
What kind of deal
did Aureliano make with them?

20:37.005 --> 20:38.405
The right deal.

20:39.045 --> 20:41.605
He found a way to resolve everything
without too many wars.

20:41.685 --> 20:43.485
Which are never good
for business, are they?

20:43.845 --> 20:45.565
Now let's get back to work.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.485
Tell your friend he could have at least
given me his condolences.

21:02.685 --> 21:04.725
He's been busy getting
this stuff for everyone.

21:05.805 --> 21:07.645
With you,
he'll make a different proposition.

21:09.045 --> 21:11.125
My father spent more time with him
than with me.

21:11.965 --> 21:13.845
A proposition isn't enough for me.

21:15.605 --> 21:17.925
And I don't want
to do business with Gypsies.

22:09.045 --> 22:10.205
Why are you stopping?

22:10.685 --> 22:12.405
As soon as he sees us, he'll kill us.

22:13.005 --> 22:14.765
We can't go there
without letting him know.

22:15.365 --> 22:16.685
I have to call him.

22:35.445 --> 22:36.525
Hi.

22:37.605 --> 22:39.925
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

22:40.005 --> 22:41.165
But we have to talk.

22:42.005 --> 22:43.485
No, no, not on the phone.

22:44.965 --> 22:46.525
Good. I'm on my way.

22:48.925 --> 22:50.645
-All set?
-All set.

22:50.725 --> 22:51.965
Now drive.

23:16.085 --> 23:17.685
She's done it. She reported it.

23:18.925 --> 23:20.325
Are we still in time?

23:20.925 --> 23:23.085
Yes, the news should break soon.

23:29.005 --> 23:30.205
What is it?

23:37.005 --> 23:38.245
Let's go.

23:42.445 --> 23:43.845
I want to help you.

23:44.405 --> 23:47.165
I heard about the Countess. Poor thing.

23:47.965 --> 23:51.085
But if no one knows she was murdered,
you've lost, Cinaglia.

23:51.165 --> 23:52.365
But if people did know?

23:53.725 --> 23:55.085
That's where you're wrong.

23:57.365 --> 24:00.005
My wife just left the police station.

24:00.085 --> 24:02.325
Yeah, but she spoke to the wrong cop.

24:03.165 --> 24:06.205
That report won't exist until tomorrow,
and tomorrow it'll be of no use to you.

24:13.725 --> 24:15.325
There's not much time left, right?

24:23.485 --> 24:25.285
I want to be honest with you.

24:26.285 --> 24:28.445
I tried to find someone else on the Left

24:28.525 --> 24:29.885
but it didn't work out.

24:30.525 --> 24:32.245
You were right. They're a tight group.

24:32.845 --> 24:34.725
And they're convinced they've already won.

24:35.725 --> 24:38.685
And you and I are back in the same boat.
I don't have allies.

24:38.765 --> 24:40.245
And you don't have the news.

24:44.765 --> 24:46.125
So, what do you propose?

24:47.565 --> 24:49.725
I like female pragmatism.

24:51.445 --> 24:53.405
I can get the news out that you need.

24:54.085 --> 24:56.525
Tell everyone
that the Countess was murdered.

24:56.605 --> 24:59.765
In a matter of hours, I can raise hell.
What do you say?

25:01.085 --> 25:02.965
That I need to see results.

25:05.565 --> 25:07.765
Look, let's cut to the chase.

25:07.845 --> 25:09.685
I'll get the news out

25:09.765 --> 25:12.165
and then we can work out
the fine print of our new deal.

25:12.245 --> 25:14.805
Besides, if I can't do it,
we're both fucked.

25:15.605 --> 25:16.605
Actually...

25:17.405 --> 25:18.405
all three of us.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.085
-Hey, bro.
-Hi.

25:35.165 --> 25:37.005
-You got a light?
-Yeah.

25:55.685 --> 25:56.925
-Bye, thanks.
-Bye.

25:58.965 --> 26:00.045
Want a cigarette?

26:13.285 --> 26:14.765
This is for my father.

26:15.845 --> 26:18.005
Fuck your deal with Aureliano!

26:18.925 --> 26:19.925
Let's go.

26:24.485 --> 26:26.165
Anacleti scum!

26:39.565 --> 26:40.885
Where the fuck are we?

26:42.005 --> 26:43.125
We're here.

26:45.885 --> 26:46.885
Get out.

26:59.965 --> 27:01.165
Where do we have to go?

27:30.325 --> 27:33.845
All the teams are getting new players,
and what are we doing?

27:33.925 --> 27:35.165
Standing by watching.

27:35.245 --> 27:39.165
I know he's expensive,
but we absolutely have to acquire him.

27:39.245 --> 27:40.565
All we do is complain.

27:40.645 --> 27:42.125
Here's what I think.

27:42.205 --> 27:44.245
If we want to finally...

27:44.325 --> 27:47.325
win, if we want to finally be competitive,

27:47.405 --> 27:49.125
a sacrifice has to be made.

27:49.205 --> 27:53.285
Now we're going to take a short break
but we'll keep discussing this afterward.

27:53.365 --> 27:55.405
So stay tuned. Back in a moment.

27:56.725 --> 27:58.565
-Hey.
-I need a hand, Adriano.

27:58.645 --> 27:59.965
What happened?

28:00.045 --> 28:02.605
You have to put a piece of news
on the air. It's important.

28:02.685 --> 28:06.085
-And you need me to do it?
-Yes. To do it now, yes. I can't wait.

28:07.405 --> 28:09.965
-What do I have to say?
-That the Countess was murdered.

28:10.045 --> 28:12.365
It wasn't an accident,
and there's a witness.

28:15.125 --> 28:17.165
-And you? How do you know?
-I know.

28:18.605 --> 28:22.405
The news of the murder of a noblewoman
in downtown Rome will help the Right win.

28:24.005 --> 28:25.765
Are you back with Cinaglia, Samurai?

28:27.245 --> 28:29.485
I'm talking to you.
Are you back with that piece of shit?

28:29.565 --> 28:32.085
-You've got to wake up! Listen to me--
-No! You listen to me.

28:32.165 --> 28:34.565
Have you forgotten
that he was about to kill me?

28:34.645 --> 28:36.965
He destroys people for his own interests.

28:37.045 --> 28:40.325
-And for Aureliano Adami and that Gypsy.
-No, forget about those two.

28:40.405 --> 28:44.085
You and me can make a new deal with him.
One that'll work for all of us.

28:44.165 --> 28:46.245
Then Cinaglia will be my puppet, trust me.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.845
Yeah, we've seen... A puppet!

28:49.325 --> 28:50.965
A puppet that fucks you over!

28:51.045 --> 28:53.165
My life depends on it, Adriano.

28:57.045 --> 28:59.885
You've taken more bullets
than an army in the trenches.

29:01.485 --> 29:03.365
I'm sure you'll find a solution.

29:05.045 --> 29:06.045
Adriano.

29:14.885 --> 29:16.005
What the fuck are you doing?

29:16.605 --> 29:17.965
Do me this favor.

29:20.605 --> 29:24.045
Just this morning, I thought how nice
it would've been to have a dad like you.

29:25.605 --> 29:26.645
One who helps you.

29:28.165 --> 29:29.605
Not one who points a gun at you.

29:30.165 --> 29:33.125
Fathers do that too, if it helps
to teach their sons to grow up.

29:46.325 --> 29:49.045
Here we are back on air.

29:49.125 --> 29:51.165
However, before we continue
discussing Roma,

29:51.245 --> 29:53.445
I have to give
you some terrible news, my friends.

29:53.525 --> 29:56.485
Some breaking news that makes one wonder:

29:59.045 --> 30:00.885
are we really safe in this city?

30:01.445 --> 30:03.525
Because what seemed
to have been an accident

30:04.285 --> 30:05.885
now appears to have been murder.

30:07.885 --> 30:10.285
Countess Sveva Della Rocca Croce...

30:11.445 --> 30:12.965
was murdered.

30:26.005 --> 30:28.285
Apparently there's proof.

30:28.365 --> 30:30.285
There's even talk of witnesses.

30:30.845 --> 30:34.525
We'll see how the situation develops
over the next few hours, and...

30:34.605 --> 30:36.605
as always, we'll keep you updated.

30:37.765 --> 30:39.725
Okay, after that news,

30:39.805 --> 30:41.725
even if it's not at all easy,

30:41.805 --> 30:43.685
let's get back to talking about soccer.

31:12.965 --> 31:15.165
So, you finally managed
to get your ass kicked.

31:18.725 --> 31:20.645
So, tell us what the fuck you want.
We're busy.

31:20.725 --> 31:22.245
I want to apologize to you.

31:24.805 --> 31:27.125
I did the worst thing someone can do.

31:28.645 --> 31:30.965
Samurai was on my ass, blackmailing me,

31:31.045 --> 31:32.205
threatening me.

31:33.525 --> 31:34.965
I was afraid he was going to kill me.

31:37.325 --> 31:38.605
I didn't have the balls.

31:39.485 --> 31:40.525
I just didn't.

31:43.765 --> 31:45.045
That's why I killed your father.

31:48.005 --> 31:49.765
That's why my father died.

31:51.725 --> 31:53.085
I think about it all the time.

31:55.765 --> 31:56.845
Every day.

32:02.645 --> 32:03.725
Forgive me.

32:04.285 --> 32:06.605
Forgive me, both of you.
Because I can't.

32:12.165 --> 32:15.045
Yesterday, Samurai beat me to a pulp.

32:17.885 --> 32:19.245
But I didn't talk.

32:20.125 --> 32:21.365
I didn't tell him anything.

32:23.045 --> 32:24.165
Not a thing.

32:25.205 --> 32:26.645
Because I'm not afraid anymore.

32:29.125 --> 32:30.765
Now I'm free.

32:31.725 --> 32:33.285
You're the only friends I have.

32:34.405 --> 32:35.885
And I love you.

32:40.325 --> 32:41.965
But I'm not like you.

32:42.925 --> 32:44.045
-Hey!
-Hey!

33:27.005 --> 33:29.685
Aureliano, someone's here.
We've got to go.

33:31.485 --> 33:32.925
And just leave him here?

33:35.325 --> 33:38.005
We'll come back to get him. Let's go.

35:13.725 --> 35:14.725
All good.

35:22.645 --> 35:25.005
Stop counting.
We need to rethink the deal.

35:25.085 --> 35:26.405
What's the fucking problem?

35:26.485 --> 35:29.005
One of your guys wounded one of mine
and ran off with the money.

35:29.405 --> 35:31.165
We can't trust you.

35:31.245 --> 35:34.765
-What are you talking about? Are you sure?
-Of course I'm sure. He's still bleeding.

35:35.245 --> 35:37.765
-And who was it?
-That's for you to tell me.

35:41.485 --> 35:44.605
All right. We'll give you
the money back out of our cut.

35:46.285 --> 35:48.085
I don't need money.

35:48.165 --> 35:49.205
The deal ends here.

35:50.765 --> 35:52.645
Yeah, but you don't decide these things.

35:55.605 --> 35:57.085
Your man does.

35:57.765 --> 36:00.845
And he wants to stay here
in Ostia with Aureliano.

36:01.845 --> 36:04.045
Remember that I'm Spadino's wife.

36:04.925 --> 36:06.845
Who the fuck are you?

36:14.125 --> 36:18.085
The last hours before the closing
of the ballot boxes were decisive

36:18.165 --> 36:21.405
owing to the extremely high turnout.

36:21.485 --> 36:24.245
And here are the results.
They've just come in.

36:24.325 --> 36:30.445
The Right, with 54.09% of the vote,
wins the election...

36:30.525 --> 36:31.765
We won.

36:38.365 --> 36:40.565
But this victory cost us dear.

36:44.965 --> 36:47.525
In fact, now we have
to take Rome for Lele too.

36:50.325 --> 36:52.605
Remember when you told me
that I changed your life.

36:59.525 --> 37:00.925
Yeah, well...

37:01.765 --> 37:03.765
-That's all in the past.
-Yeah.

37:07.965 --> 37:09.525
My life has changed too.

37:16.965 --> 37:18.685
And you've always been there.

37:24.565 --> 37:25.965
You've never abandoned me.

37:28.925 --> 37:32.205
Not even when I was out of my mind
or when I told you to fuck off.

37:41.165 --> 37:42.525
I love you, Spadino.

37:44.885 --> 37:45.885
For real.

37:59.045 --> 38:00.325
What, are you drinking now?

38:01.085 --> 38:03.285
A toast to those no longer with us.

38:25.485 --> 38:26.685
What happened?

38:32.285 --> 38:33.845
Nothing. I've got to go.

38:34.965 --> 38:36.205
Should I come with you?

38:37.085 --> 38:38.085
No.

38:38.685 --> 38:39.885
I'll call you later.

39:12.925 --> 39:16.885
Amedeo! Amedeo!

39:18.565 --> 39:20.365
Oh, at last.

39:25.005 --> 39:26.845
Thank you!

39:26.925 --> 39:29.285
Thank you, guys.
It's all thanks to you.

39:29.965 --> 39:32.365
Starting today, Rome changes!

39:32.445 --> 39:33.725
Yes!

39:49.245 --> 39:51.245
I know I shouldn't have come, but...

39:52.125 --> 39:54.325
we created all this together.

39:57.605 --> 39:58.765
Thank you, Sara.

40:01.485 --> 40:02.685
Hi.

40:02.765 --> 40:03.685
Hi.

40:04.725 --> 40:06.725
Why don't you stay and celebrate with us?

40:07.405 --> 40:09.445
No, thanks, I can't. I have to go.

40:11.205 --> 40:12.405
Congratulations.

40:13.445 --> 40:15.285
-Call you later.
-Yes.

40:16.005 --> 40:17.205
-Bye.
-Bye.

40:50.485 --> 40:53.765
Where were you? All hell has broken loose.
We need to talk.

40:54.365 --> 40:55.365
What?

40:55.845 --> 40:58.845
Our dealers started up again real good.
We made a shitload of money.

40:59.725 --> 41:02.485
-But then Angelica showed up.
-What happened?

41:03.125 --> 41:06.565
It seems one of our guys fucked up and...
What are you doing?

42:47.845 --> 42:48.845
Alex?

42:50.085 --> 42:51.205
Where are you?

42:59.605 --> 43:00.685
Come with me.

43:23.445 --> 43:26.685
-What the fuck did you do to him?
-What did I do to him? I made him talk.

43:29.165 --> 43:30.525
I know everything about you two.

43:31.965 --> 43:34.765
Now I'll take him home and make him repeat
what he told me. Sound good?

43:37.085 --> 43:38.565
But I don't have to do that...

43:40.405 --> 43:42.125
as long as you give up control

43:43.365 --> 43:44.525
and hand it to me.

43:47.325 --> 43:48.805
I'm sorry, Alberto.

43:50.085 --> 43:51.245
You don't know how sorry I am.

44:03.005 --> 44:04.205
I'm sorry too.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.485
Sometimes like a king
Without an army

44:30.565 --> 44:33.925
Without a throne or a scepter
Carrying a borrowed sword

44:34.005 --> 44:36.925
Sometimes I only move the vocab
For how I am

44:37.005 --> 44:39.445
I'll take you where I am
It's a sour taste...

44:39.525 --> 44:41.485
Now take him home and get him to talk.

44:47.445 --> 44:49.965
I bring the pressure
And confusion with me

44:50.045 --> 44:52.605
I weaponize it
Calibrated by the condition

44:52.685 --> 44:55.245
To stay outside and inside
Without approval

44:55.325 --> 44:58.405
And to keep my head high
Among other people, with my name

44:58.485 --> 45:00.725
Sometimes it all changes
And moves away

45:00.805 --> 45:03.005
Sometimes they're filigree nightmares

45:03.085 --> 45:04.485
Until the bell rings

45:04.565 --> 45:06.005
Yet another round

45:06.085 --> 45:08.285
To show those sons of bitches

45:08.365 --> 45:10.645
You think you can send me to the ropes

45:10.725 --> 45:12.965
This life hits hard
Call me the "wrestler"

45:13.045 --> 45:15.485
The wheel turns
And sometimes you lose your bets

45:15.565 --> 45:18.365
I'm on the ground
But I aim at the peak like Messner

45:18.445 --> 45:20.405
Life's an elevator without buttons

45:20.485 --> 45:23.685
Going up and down as it likes
You're born in it, what can you do?

45:23.765 --> 45:26.805
Kick and punch the doors in
Till you get to the right floor

45:26.885 --> 45:28.685
Then at last you can stay there

45:28.765 --> 45:31.325
Rap's good one day, it's tough the next

45:31.405 --> 45:33.925
Life's good one day, it's tough the next

45:34.005 --> 45:37.525
Love can go flat
But then come up and take me higher

45:37.605 --> 45:39.005
Always the same

45:39.085 --> 45:41.765
Rap's good one day, it's tough the next

45:41.845 --> 45:44.365
Life's good one day, it's tough the next

45:44.445 --> 45:48.285
Love can go flat
But then come up and take me higher

45:48.365 --> 45:50.045
Always the same

45:54.605 --> 45:55.605
Cinaglia.

45:56.765 --> 45:57.765
Come over here.

46:03.565 --> 46:04.965
Well?

46:05.045 --> 46:06.965
In the end you were right, huh?

46:07.605 --> 46:09.205
You made just one mistake.

46:11.245 --> 46:13.165
You needed Samurai's help again.

46:14.285 --> 46:15.885
We started out together.

46:23.325 --> 46:24.325
To this city.

46:31.845 --> 46:33.885
Now we're on the same side.

46:34.485 --> 46:37.085
I'm not interested one bit
in your business.

46:37.165 --> 46:38.325
What are you interested in?

46:39.845 --> 46:40.685
Immigrants.

46:40.765 --> 46:42.365
That's a good business, too.

46:42.925 --> 46:45.085
I can put my properties at your disposal.

46:47.725 --> 46:48.725
We can go.

46:49.245 --> 46:50.565
No, not yet.

46:52.205 --> 46:54.565
We have to set the terms of the deal.

46:56.045 --> 46:57.965
I want Adami and the Anacletis gone.

46:58.565 --> 46:59.965
How can I get rid of them?

47:00.045 --> 47:01.965
They're the ones who did everything.

47:02.045 --> 47:04.525
Now that you've won,
you don't need them anymore.

47:07.725 --> 47:09.725
Give him some ideas
on how to save his ass.

47:09.805 --> 47:11.325
I think he needs them.

47:19.445 --> 47:21.005
We'll find a solution.

47:21.085 --> 47:23.605
Rap's good one day, it's tough the next

47:23.685 --> 47:26.205
Life's good one day, it's tough the next

47:26.285 --> 47:29.805
Love can go flat
But then come up and take me higher

47:29.885 --> 47:31.285
Always the same

47:31.365 --> 47:34.085
Rap's good one day, it's tough the next

47:34.165 --> 47:36.645
Life's good one day, it's tough the next

47:36.725 --> 47:40.245
Love can go flat
But then come up and take me higher

47:40.325 --> 47:41.725
Always the same

47:41.805 --> 47:45.325
I've got a rhyme for each of my fears
One for when it's all good

47:45.405 --> 47:48.765
One for when the axe of fate comes down
Slams the door

47:48.845 --> 47:52.405
In this crap shoot with life
This game of chess with death

47:52.485 --> 47:54.245
Time's too short to waste any

47:54.325 --> 47:57.965
Mistrust grows
But the heart still burns and I'm hot

47:58.045 --> 48:00.125
On a good day come higher with me

48:00.205 --> 48:03.085
On a tough day, buddy, stand by my side

48:03.165 --> 48:04.805
I don't believe in much anymore

48:04.885 --> 48:08.085
I'm hungry as a hound
For what destiny has taken from me

48:08.165 --> 48:10.565
Rap's good one day, it's tough the next

48:10.645 --> 48:13.165
Life's good one day, it's tough the next

48:13.245 --> 48:16.765
Love can go flat
But then come up and take me higher

48:16.845 --> 48:18.845
Always the same

48:25.245 --> 48:27.085
Cinaglia hasn't called you yet,
am I right?

48:31.125 --> 48:32.885
If you come any closer I'll kill you.

48:32.965 --> 48:34.205
Who the fuck are you?

48:34.845 --> 48:37.085
A guy with the same problem as you.

48:38.525 --> 48:40.645
Cinaglia is back with Samurai.

48:43.725 --> 48:45.405
You had a deal.

48:46.645 --> 48:49.445
You thought you'd reign over Rome.

48:49.525 --> 48:51.285
Instead he fucked both of you over.

48:53.605 --> 48:55.565
Why'd you come here to tell us this?

48:57.645 --> 48:59.285
Because they fucked me over, too.

49:00.125 --> 49:01.485
Cinaglia and Samurai.

49:02.885 --> 49:05.485
And I don't want you to suffer
the same fate as your friend.

49:08.005 --> 49:10.605
If you want
to go up against those two pieces of shit

49:10.685 --> 49:12.485
I'm at your disposal.

49:15.805 --> 49:18.005
I beat my tempo
With my hand on the wall

49:18.085 --> 49:20.605
One beat goes to love
And one to the dark side

49:20.685 --> 49:23.685
I have the strength
It runs like lava in my veins

49:23.765 --> 49:26.485
But when in doubt remember
I come for the good

49:26.565 --> 49:28.005
I come for those who come in peace

49:28.085 --> 49:31.165
I come for those who can't shut up
If they don't like something

49:31.245 --> 49:33.725
For those who can't keep quiet
And don't give in

49:33.805 --> 49:36.965
Even if it goes up and then down
And it seems nothing changes

49:37.045 --> 49:39.685
Rap's good one day, it's tough the next

49:39.765 --> 49:42.125
Life's good one day, it's tough the next

49:42.205 --> 49:45.725
Love can go flat
But then come up and take me higher

49:45.805 --> 49:47.325
Always the same

49:47.405 --> 49:49.965
Always the same...

50:02.845 --> 50:04.245
What did I miss?

50:05.405 --> 50:07.845
