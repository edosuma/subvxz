ABOUT THE KISS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

03:47.367 --> 03:51.300
I'M SORRY, CORY. IT WAS
THE BEST THING I COULD
THINK OF AT THE TIME.

LYING'S THE ISSUE.

I TOLD YOU
THAT WASN'T
GONNA WORK OUT.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.600

12 YEARS AGO.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.033

FOR ME IN THE SNOW

04:43.567 --> 04:44.900

SPECIAL I WAS

04:44.900 --> 04:46.700
AND WE
WERE ALWAYS GOING
TO BE TOGETHER.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.133

THIS VALENTINE'S DAY.

04:49.133 --> 04:50.834
HE MADE PLANS WITH YOU
THIS VALENTINE'S DAY?

04:50.834 --> 04:54.700

SOMEWHERE NICE.

TOGETHER FOREVER.

WE'RE GOING TO DINNER
AND A MOVIE. NOTHING
FANCY. NO BIG DEAL.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.500

OF COMMITTING

05:13.500 --> 05:14.800

HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO A RELATIONSHIP.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.767
HE'LL BACK OUT.

05:17.767 --> 05:19.300

KNOW HOW TO BE

TO HAVE TO START
ALL OVER.

AND I SAID THINGS
THAT I WANTED TO FEEL.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.967

I'M SORRY IF I HURT
ANY OF YOU.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.200

TO YOU.

18:54.233 --> 18:58.500
I WANT TO CHANGE
OUR RELATIONSHIP...

WANT TO END UP?

I DON'T WANT TO
END UP SAYING THINGS
THAT I DON'T MEAN.

AND I DON'T WANT
TO END UP

MAKING A PROMISE
THAT I CAN'T KEEP.
NOT TO YOU.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.700
WHY NOT TO ME?

19:22.700 --> 19:24.700
I DON'T WANT TO SAY.
