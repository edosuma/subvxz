WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:04.303
Hey. Hey, what can  I get you?

00:04.305 --> 00:07.439
Can I get a beer
and, uh, your number?

00:07.441 --> 00:09.608
Actually, I'm...
This woman is engaged.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.876
Her number belongs to God now.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.277
Thank you.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.445
My bad, I didn't see a ring.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.446
I'm wo... I'm working on it.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.447
That's something I'm working on.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.682
Can't just put any ring

00:16.684 --> 00:18.183
on the hand of the most
perfect woman in the world.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.618
Now shoo.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.986
Back to the mechanical shop
or wherever it is you work.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.454
Enjoy.
Thank you.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.956
Okay, so you're doing it again.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.157
I'm doing what?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.325
Ever since we got engaged,

00:26.327 --> 00:27.726
you've been acting
insanely jealous.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.361
Look, all bartenders

00:29.363 --> 00:30.729
get hit on.

00:30.731 --> 00:31.730
It's just part of the job.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.298
Even Nick has groupies.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.234
Are you free tonight?
I am, yeah.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.870
Me, too! (laughs): Oh, hey, well, I
really hope you find something to do.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.142
WINSTON: Nick is
playing hard to get.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.176
What was wrong with her?

00:44.178 --> 00:45.411
I just wasn't feeling it.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.345
What's "it"?

00:46.347 --> 00:47.679
(scoffs)
It's obvious.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.249
It's, you know, it's...

00:50.251 --> 00:52.151
(slurring): magic. What?  Hmm?

00:52.153 --> 00:53.852
Little bit of the magic thing,
little bit of the ...

00:53.854 --> 00:55.821
"Man stick"?
I'm not saying "man stick."

00:55.823 --> 00:56.989
It's what I heard.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.524
I'm saying "magic."
Oh.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.526
I don't know, I just...
I want magic.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.860
Is that so bad?

01:01.862 --> 01:04.196
I want the music to swell.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.331
I want the wind to blow.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.933
I-I want the clouds to part.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.535
Yeah.
Love! Magic!

01:09.537 --> 01:11.036
Something exciting!

01:11.038 --> 01:12.204
Why are you yelling?

01:12.206 --> 01:14.673
Because I am embarrassed!

01:14.675 --> 01:16.542
Don't be embarrassed, man.
I want magic, too.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.677
I want her to
have a metal bra,

01:18.679 --> 01:20.879
and then I got a sword in
my hand, and guess what,

01:20.881 --> 01:22.681
we both wearing skirts.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.683
And we're riding
on flying horses.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.785
That's more like dork magic.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.454
Okay, I don't want
to upset you guys,

01:28.456 --> 01:30.456
but if you keep
looking for magic,

01:30.458 --> 01:31.790
you're gonna be
alone forever.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.125
Did you just say
you don't mean to upset us

01:33.127 --> 01:34.560
and then tell us
we're gonna end up alone?

01:34.562 --> 01:36.061
I actually don't care
if I upset you.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.529
Yeah, 'cause that's
really upsetting.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.198
You know, I got to...
I got to say,

01:39.200 --> 01:41.200
I'm with Aly on this one;
she's making sense.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.202
Which is why she always
plays "smart cop"

01:43.204 --> 01:44.369
when we play "Smart
Cop/Dumb Cop."

01:44.371 --> 01:45.537
Not a game we play.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.207
I'm super worried
you think we do, terrified.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.608
I feel like we're
playing it right now.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.577
Great "dumb cop,"
great "smart cop."

01:51.579 --> 01:53.412
You two need to get realistic.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.980
You're not getting any
younger, Nick. Wrong.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.648
I'm in the prime of my life.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.083
Watch me do my thing.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.719
Show her, dude.
Get it!

02:00.721 --> 02:03.388
Show her what
you got, Nick.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.057
(chuckles with exertion)

02:05.059 --> 02:06.058
See it? See it?

02:06.060 --> 02:07.059
Do you see it?

02:07.061 --> 02:08.060
Is it up?

02:08.062 --> 02:09.394
Can you see it?

02:09.396 --> 02:11.463
(chuckles with exertion)

02:15.636 --> 02:16.969
Winston, call an ambulance.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.204
I smushed every bone in my back.

02:20.407 --> 02:21.406
(groans)

02:21.408 --> 02:22.908
Looks like you got
"old man back."

02:22.910 --> 02:25.244
Welcome to the club.
Looks like a cool club.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.812
(laughing)

02:28.782 --> 02:30.282
Ugh, you hear that?

02:30.284 --> 02:32.417
Yeah, I'm sitting
closer than you.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.086
Aly was right.

02:34.088 --> 02:35.587
We are getting older.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.089
Ugh, don't remind me.

02:37.091 --> 02:38.257
I don't want to
be alone forever.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.424
Maybe it's time
I start looking

02:39.426 --> 02:41.093
at my love life
more realistically.

02:41.095 --> 02:43.095
Hmm. I feel like one
of those characters

02:43.097 --> 02:45.764
in the show<i> Sax and the</i>
<i> City</i> talking about this.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.467
Oh, no, you mean, um,
uh,<i> Sex and the City.</i>

02:48.469 --> 02:51.203
I'm talking about the one with
the four ladies in a jazz band.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.704
That's not a show.
Carrie, Miranda,

02:52.706 --> 02:54.439
No. the other one
and the older one.

02:54.441 --> 02:55.941
You're thinking
of<i> Sex and the City.</i>

02:55.943 --> 02:58.277
They would never allow
that 'cause of the title.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.611
(chuckles) Anyway, man,
I'm with you, you know?

02:59.613 --> 03:00.879
I think we should be
more realistic

03:00.881 --> 03:02.147
about who we're dating.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.482
We got to keep each
other from dreaming.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.716
(both chuckle)

03:04.718 --> 03:06.318
So if you see me dreaming...
Pinch you.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.488
Well, don't pinch me, but
just let me know. Okay.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.489
Let's make a deal.
Let's make a deal.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.624
I got your back, you got my back.
Yeah.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.126
It's time.
It's time.

03:14.128 --> 03:16.195
♪ ♪

03:26.640 --> 03:28.140
Why did y...?

03:28.142 --> 03:29.942
♪ ♪

03:32.179 --> 03:34.479
Reagan Lucas
to see Dr. Richards.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.248
I'm so sorry, Dr. Richards is...

03:36.250 --> 03:37.382
He's right behind
that water cooler.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.087
Why don't I see any orders

03:42.089 --> 03:43.655
for Recombinex
from you this month, Don?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.424
Well, um...
What is this?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.726
Spectavir, Donny?
Are you kidding me?

03:47.728 --> 03:48.994
Maybe we can talk when you've...

03:48.996 --> 03:50.762
When I've had a chance
to consult my physician

03:50.764 --> 03:53.098
about the possible side effects
of Spectavir?

03:53.100 --> 03:56.168
Side effects which include
dry mouth and diarrhea,

03:56.170 --> 04:00.005
wet mouth and constipation, butt
sneezing, hysterical deafness,

04:00.007 --> 04:02.741
unwelcomed night-running,
dusty semen...

04:02.743 --> 04:05.711
You know what, why don't I put
in an order for Recombinex.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.212
Ooh, great,
but only if you want to.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.680
Anything else I can do for you?

04:08.682 --> 04:09.881
Not unless you can get me

04:09.883 --> 04:11.283
a hotel room downtown
for the next month.

04:11.285 --> 04:14.019
My company is putting me at the
Redbrick Lodge and Seafood Hut.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.288
Ugh.
My key is a fish.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.523
We have a room!
We have a room available.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.926
I overheard you, sorry.
We have a room.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.295
Uh, my name is Nick,
uh, Nicholas for long.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.429
Uh, my friend and I have

04:24.431 --> 04:26.932
a lovely room for rent
in our loft downtown.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.367
You see, our old roommate

04:28.369 --> 04:29.635
is on jury duty.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.636
Her name is Jess, Jessica.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.970
We had a little
"will they/won't they."

04:31.972 --> 04:33.872
Then we did, and then we
fought a little bit too much.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.307
We still have a really nice thing.
WINSTON: Excuse me, ma'am.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.476
I am truly sorry
for my friend here,

04:37.478 --> 04:40.479
but I am sure it
is not<i> realistic</i>

04:40.481 --> 04:43.882
that you would want to rent
a place from total strangers.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.552
Normally, no, but I have
a lobster tank in my bedroom.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.655
We have no lobsters.
What is the rent like?

04:49.657 --> 04:50.989
What do you want it to be?
I don't care.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.057
What?
Cheap.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.725
Amenities?
Yeah, we got those.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.327
You got a rain shower?
I love a rain shower.

04:55.329 --> 04:58.230
Rain shower? Crazy enough,
we were installing one today.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.899
Well, you are weirdly
checking all of my boxes,

05:00.901 --> 05:03.068
so... I'll come take a look.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.737
Great, good.
The, uh, the address is...

05:05.739 --> 05:07.606
right here on the form
under my name.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.907
Great, I'll see you tonight.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.243
Good luck with your...

05:11.245 --> 05:13.578
"smush pain that feels

05:13.580 --> 05:15.914
like everything came out
of the sandwich."

05:15.916 --> 05:18.317
Doesn't even hurt
that much, actually.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.354
Nick, this is crazy.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.455
Come on, man.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.790
We agreed to not
let each other

05:24.792 --> 05:26.458
do exactly this
anymore.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.360
Do I have to get
tough with you?

05:28.362 --> 05:29.695
Just admit it, you're jealous.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.596
Uh, I'm not. I simply want
a demographic breakdown

05:31.598 --> 05:33.031
of all the guys
who hit on you.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.435
You know, jacked dudes,
swole dudes, yoked dudes.

05:36.437 --> 05:40.305
What in Megyn Kelly's
America are you doing, Nick?

05:40.307 --> 05:41.540
I'm installing
a high-end shower.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.774
Nick's got a crush on a girl

05:42.776 --> 05:43.942
who is way out of his league.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.444
Oh...
Ooh...

05:45.446 --> 05:47.112
Do you want a boom box? You gonna
invite her to winter formal?

05:47.114 --> 05:49.614
When you're my age, you don't
form crushes anymore.

05:49.616 --> 05:50.782
I'm past that.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.951
I don't remember
anything about her.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.854
I mean, what, does she have
brown hair, brown eyes, a nose?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.723
She had moxie, she ran the room,
she commanded it.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.891
(knocking)
She's here, she's here!

05:59.893 --> 06:01.560
All right, guys,
make your hair look good.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.562
Everybody, make your hair
look good, okay?

06:03.564 --> 06:04.696
Don't embarrass me.

06:09.236 --> 06:12.571
South-facing windows, a balcony,
stainless steel appliances,

06:12.573 --> 06:15.173
and I'm guessing
someone with extreme OCD

06:15.175 --> 06:16.975
that lives here
to keep this place clean.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.210
Hello, I'm Schmidt.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.612
You were a large child.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.815
That's incredible.
Yes, I-I was obese.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.452
You look familiar.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.989
<i> MTV Beach House,</i> 2003.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.991
Oh, my God, Reagan?!

06:32.993 --> 06:33.892
REAGAN:
Cece, hi.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.560
How are you?
Oh, my God!

06:35.562 --> 06:36.895
I'm so happy
to see you.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.597
You, too. You
look incredible!

06:38.599 --> 06:39.831
Barely recognized you.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.333
Well, you've never
seen me dry. (laughs)

06:41.335 --> 06:43.668
Cece, y-you went
to the MTV Beach House?

06:43.670 --> 06:45.771
Did you get to announce
a video and then scream?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.105
Actually, we both did.
Yeah.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.440
And then we hooked up.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.008
Yeah, that's true, too.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.579
(moaning softly)

06:55.716 --> 06:56.882
Is he okay?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.717
It sounds like there's
a dishwasher in his face.

06:58.719 --> 07:02.754
I know, it's just, uh...
he's just processing.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.189
(continues moaning softly)

07:08.695 --> 07:10.695
What a turn of events, the fact
that you guys hooked up.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.030
You know, that was
a big summer for me.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.732
Remember, I-I pierced my nose.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.400
I know.
I forgave my mom.

07:15.402 --> 07:16.635
I realized that I was bisexual.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.637
I mean, of course
I went for you.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.971
I go nuts for big boobs.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.373
I'm a real melon-felon.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.874
Oh, trust me,
I remember. (laughs)

07:25.379 --> 07:27.245
I think he's having a seizure.
CECE: No, no.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.548
It's just that when he has
to process a lot of emotions,

07:29.550 --> 07:33.051
sometimes he likes to do Nick
Cannon's solo from<i> Drumline.</i>

07:36.290 --> 07:38.990
Maybe it's best if you continue
seeing the rest of the apartment

07:38.992 --> 07:41.426
and I will, uh, make some
snacks with Schmidt here.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.762
That's a great idea.
Reagan, I'll give you the tour.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.664
Winston, you don't have to come.
No, but I want to.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.732
Oh, don't, you're too sweet.
And I'm walking away.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.401
You can stay. It would
be my pleasure to come.

07:49.403 --> 07:50.569
I-- literally nobody
wants you to come.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.570
WINSTON (chuckles):
Right this way.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.338
Hey. Can we talk?
Hmm?

07:53.340 --> 07:54.539
One second.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.278
Yes, of course.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.613
Why? Did something
of note happen?

08:01.615 --> 08:02.781
Someone I hooked
up with once

08:02.783 --> 08:04.182
is potentially gonna live here.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.584
Totally fine with it.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.585
Okay.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.420
As long as we both agree

08:08.422 --> 08:11.690
that open communication is the
key to a healthy relationship.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.192
Of course. Just one second.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.994
Be right back.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.199
NICK:
So that's where

08:21.201 --> 08:24.769
you'd put your,
uh, body at night.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.705
Alone or with somebody.

08:26.707 --> 08:27.506
Up to you.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.940
Ooh.
Well, I like the room.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.442
Great. I think I just
want to get rid of

08:30.444 --> 08:32.010
the pillows, the yarn,

08:32.012 --> 08:34.145
the tote bags
and anything else that makes me

08:34.147 --> 08:35.614
feel racist
against white people.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.649
That's everything Jess owns,
now, isn't it, Nick?

08:37.651 --> 08:39.117
Gone. It's all gone.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.118
We'll take care of it.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.187
Winston is
the loft warrior.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.455
I'm kind of the
rock of the group.

08:43.457 --> 08:44.456
Really?

08:44.458 --> 08:46.157
He's the rock
of the group,

08:46.159 --> 08:48.460
and I'm sure Reagan would love
to see how the rock lives.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.662
Oh, my God,

08:50.664 --> 08:52.364
it's worse
than I thought.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.965
So this is my room.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.001
I love it;
it's my safe place.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.470
This is where I write
my letters to editors.

08:58.472 --> 08:59.471
I'm a writer.

08:59.473 --> 09:00.572
It's where I also
write checks

09:00.574 --> 09:01.973
to poor people.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.241
Charity is so important to me.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.977
Over there,
that's, of course, my bed.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.246
That's where I dream,
that's where I sleep,

09:08.248 --> 09:10.348
and with a lucky lady,
I do sex.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.350
Do with her.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.152
This is where I do my exercises.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.153
I'm fascinated.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.388
What exercises
do you do?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.723
Anything that
involves the body, I do.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.693
I'm good, uh, as my coach says,

09:21.695 --> 09:23.194
horizontally and vertically.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.829
What does that even mean?

09:24.831 --> 09:26.164
Your life coach?

09:26.166 --> 09:29.834
Uh, my trainer, my coach,
my leader, my guru. (groans)

09:29.836 --> 09:31.670
Is that a bowl of mashed
potatoes under your bed?

09:31.672 --> 09:33.672
May God help us
if it's not.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.206
Winston,
isn't there anything else

09:35.208 --> 09:37.175
you could be doing right now,
like, anything?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.177
Reagan, may I show
you the bathroom?

09:39.179 --> 09:41.346
Specifically,
the shower?

09:41.348 --> 09:42.781
Shower's not finished.
I'd love that.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.183
(chuckles)
To the left.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.621
Was that installed
by a child?

09:49.623 --> 09:51.222
Yes, it was.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.892
Uh, from a Big Brother
program I initiated.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.226
Let's make it rain for the woman.
She doesn't need to see it,

09:55.228 --> 09:56.528
she doesn't want to see it...

09:56.530 --> 09:57.529
That's rude of you.
Rude.

09:57.531 --> 10:00.031
Oh, look!
Look at the...

10:00.033 --> 10:01.533
A little boy came in here
and did it.

10:01.535 --> 10:03.635
He's gonna get better with practice.
Well,

10:03.637 --> 10:05.537
I'm gonna need a working shower,
so maybe I should just...

10:05.539 --> 10:06.738
Don't leave, hold on.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.740
I-If you leave,
the place could be rented.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.208
It's a hot property.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.476
There's a lot of applications.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.577
Who am I up against?

10:12.579 --> 10:14.579
A CEO of a major company
with computers.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.914
His name is

10:15.916 --> 10:18.316
Michael... Silvergold.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.317
Michael Silvergold.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.485
What is his credit score?

10:20.487 --> 10:22.754
Michael Silvergold?
Mm-hmm.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.089
T... twenty.

10:24.091 --> 10:24.723
Twenty?

10:24.725 --> 10:26.091
Five.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.225
Twenty-five.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.793
Thousand.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.996
Okay. Just fix the shower.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.664
It needs to be in
the center of the ceiling

10:32.666 --> 10:33.965
and water needs
to come out of it.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.768
You have a cat, don't you?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.737
How'd you know?
It's very obvious.

10:38.739 --> 10:39.871
Uh...

10:41.008 --> 10:42.574
Ouch... shoot.

10:42.576 --> 10:45.110
(inhales sharply)
Hold on, let me see.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.678
Okay. You know what?
Hold on a second.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.513
We have this new
heat-activated antiseptic gel.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.514
You're gonna love it.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.516
Astronauts use it
to masturbate.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.284
You are kind. You are brave.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.419
You are a Maccabee.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.187
You are Daddy's favorite boy.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.789
You are loved
by a wonderful woman.

10:57.791 --> 10:58.957
Deep breath in...

10:58.959 --> 10:59.958
(inhales)

10:59.960 --> 11:01.793
All heart, all action.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.162
Movement, direction, directive.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.133
REAGAN:
Is it working?

11:08.135 --> 11:10.135
Yeah, I feel it getting hot.  Oh,
that's because it has whale in it.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.203
CECE: So weird.
REAGAN: Yeah.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.805
CECE:
You're really good at this.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.206
Thanks. Well,
you have good hands.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.441
No!

11:16.443 --> 11:17.642
Back off, Beach House!

11:17.644 --> 11:19.611
So you're totally fine, huh?

11:19.613 --> 11:21.613
Are you freaking out because
she hooked up with a woman?

11:21.615 --> 11:22.614
That's so boring.

11:22.616 --> 11:23.448
Not at all.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.616
I completely appreciate

11:24.618 --> 11:25.784
the fluidity of sexuality.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.052
I'm basically a woman myself.

11:27.054 --> 11:27.986
You're losing the thread.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.454
I am freaking out, Reagan,

11:29.456 --> 11:31.156
because you're trying
to steal my fiancée.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.725
No, I'm not.
What are you talking about now?

11:33.727 --> 11:35.627
Everybody knows that
there is a window of time

11:35.629 --> 11:37.362
before any wedding
where some amazing person

11:37.364 --> 11:39.798
comes out of the woodwork
and tries to steal a bride.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.633
It's the plot of
every romantic comedy.

11:41.635 --> 11:43.401
I'm the Bridgette Wilson-Sampras
here!

11:43.403 --> 11:44.536
Who?
I don't know.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.905
Oh, I suppose
you're both too "cool"

11:46.907 --> 11:48.707
to have seen
<i> The Wedding Planner!</i>

11:48.709 --> 11:50.141
Well, I've seen it.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.810
You know what? I didn't even
know that you were engaged.

11:51.812 --> 11:52.877
I didn't see a ring.

11:54.648 --> 11:56.347
I am working on it!

11:56.349 --> 11:59.350
Now get out, and you-you've
crossed the line!

11:59.352 --> 12:02.420
Here's the line and you've
crossed over it. Out!

12:02.422 --> 12:03.822
No. Schmidt, enough.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.990
She's staying, I'm leaving.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.992
You really don't
trust me, do you?

12:07.994 --> 12:09.360
Just... Cece, pl-please...

12:09.362 --> 12:10.562
Darling, sit...
(door closes)

12:10.564 --> 12:12.764
That went well for you.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.967
I feel like I didn't handle
that situation correctly.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.671
(door opens, closes)

12:19.673 --> 12:21.172
Utilities are not included.

12:21.174 --> 12:24.242
Just wanted to make sure that
didn't get lost in all of this.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.183
Damn it.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.551
Are you sucking
on a block of cheese?

12:33.553 --> 12:35.620
No.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.288
Oh, my God.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.356
Here.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.024
Take this free
sample of antacids.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.726
Consider it a parting gift.

12:41.728 --> 12:42.794
I don't want this anyway.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.929
Some weird friend group...
shenanigans.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.064
I can't get involved.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.632
You're a real lone wolf, huh?

12:47.634 --> 12:49.400
New day, new city?

12:49.402 --> 12:50.869
A real lady Costner.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.470
I'm gonna take off.
So, what?

12:52.472 --> 12:54.038
You just light fires
and then walk away?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.106
I'm sorry, are you blaming me

12:55.108 --> 12:56.241
for what happened
with you and Cece?

12:56.243 --> 12:57.475
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just saying that

12:57.477 --> 12:58.710
it's all your fault,
that you caused it.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.311
You're pathetic.
<i>Y-You're</i> pathetic.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.713
You're pathetic.
<i>You're</i> pathetic.

13:01.715 --> 13:03.047
You're pathetic. You're
pathetic, you're pathetic.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.215
I'm amazing.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.383
Yeah? Well, then amaze me.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.951
Stay and fix this.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.521
What do you got?

13:13.727 --> 13:14.993
You can pick one thing.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.895
Easy. Uterus-shaped stress toy.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.696
Not surprised.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.966
(toy squeaking)

13:23.403 --> 13:24.736
This is really helping,
thank you.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.237
Can I also get
the double-sided pen?

13:26.239 --> 13:27.238
No.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.606
WINSTON:
<i> Hey, about earlier.</i>

13:28.608 --> 13:30.809
I'm sorry that I basically

13:30.811 --> 13:32.343
let you drown
in the shower.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.446
And then called you
a soggy little bitch.

13:35.448 --> 13:38.249
I don't know how to build
a rain shower, okay?!

13:38.251 --> 13:39.250
Help me!

13:39.252 --> 13:41.085
I want to help you!

13:41.087 --> 13:43.354
But I'm gonna get wet!

13:43.356 --> 13:45.323
It's too late for you!

13:45.325 --> 13:47.525
There's still time for me!

13:47.527 --> 13:50.161
I'm sorry I squirted you
with all that shampoo.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.697
It-it was supposed
to be a metaphor,

13:52.699 --> 13:55.433
but I-I really just panicked,
to be honest with you.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.869
I was trying to be tough,
but it came off as mean.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.370
No, I appreciate you
looking out for me.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.105
I-I've got no chance
with Reagan.

14:01.107 --> 14:04.943
She's hot and she's cool
and she's bisexual.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.477
That means she likes
men<i> and</i> women.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.612
I know what bisexual means.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.646
I can't compete
with that.

14:08.648 --> 14:09.781
That's too many people, Winston.

14:09.783 --> 14:11.015
That's all the people!

14:11.885 --> 14:13.852
It's time to stop chasing

14:13.854 --> 14:15.286
the magic.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.021
Now I'm gonna ask out a girl

14:17.023 --> 14:19.757
who will not stop staring at me.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.663
But why do I feel so nervous?

14:25.665 --> 14:28.967
You know, I'll tell you why
you're nervous, my friend.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.401
It's because you're human.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.503
Because you're...

14:32.505 --> 14:35.573
Where the hell is my cherry?

14:35.575 --> 14:38.309
If you are so jealous that
you want everyone else to know

14:38.311 --> 14:40.345
that Cece is engaged,
hey, here's an idea:

14:40.347 --> 14:42.080
why don't you get her a ring?

14:42.082 --> 14:43.314
Because I'm afraid
that whatever ring I get her

14:43.316 --> 14:44.649
isn't gonna be good enough.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.017
Are you worried that the ring
won't be good enough

14:46.019 --> 14:47.385
or that<i> you</i> won't be
good enough?

14:50.056 --> 14:52.090
Aren't you smart?

14:52.092 --> 14:54.158
Yeah, well, of course
I am-- I'm in sales.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.493
That's so funny.
I'm in marketing.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.662
I don't care.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.331
Look.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.666
Cece is definitely
too good for you.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.433
I know.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.668
No, but seriously.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.169
Like, she's way
too good for you.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.337
No, I know that.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.673
Like, you should have
never had a shot.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.441
It doesn't make any sense.
No, trust me.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.510
I said, like, I-I've known this
the whole time.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.878
I understand quantum
physics more than

15:13.880 --> 15:15.346
I understand how you
ended up with Cece.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.415
Don't you understand
that this is the problem,

15:17.417 --> 15:19.517
and I don't understand where
I got to where I am right now?

15:19.519 --> 15:20.351
You're right, I'm sorry.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.953
And I'm all turned around.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.421
I'm sorry, let me
try and fix it.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.923
You have two choices.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.524
You can either spend
the rest of your life

15:26.526 --> 15:30.128
terrified that somebody's gonna
swoop in and steal Cece away,

15:30.130 --> 15:33.564
or you can just love her,

15:33.566 --> 15:37.502
and thank the universe that she
loves you back for some reason.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.873
I know what I have to do.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.374
Come on, we got to go find Cece.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.242
You got to go find Cece.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.476
You're in this now, too, baby.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.611
You're responsible
for my marriage.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.745
Don't you ever
call me "baby" again.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.480
You want to make this
about you, Reagan?

15:49.482 --> 15:50.782
Your car, I'm driving.

15:50.784 --> 15:51.716
My car, I'm driving.

15:51.718 --> 15:52.984
Your car, I'm driving.

15:52.986 --> 15:53.885
My car, I'm driving.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.420
Your car, you're driving!

15:55.422 --> 15:56.421
Exactly.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.822
I said the wrong thing.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.924
NICK: Jen just agreed
to go out with me

15:59.926 --> 16:01.926
any time, any day, anywhere.
How do you feel?

16:01.928 --> 16:04.062
Totally fine,
bordering on no feeling at all.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.464
Ah, yes, the sweet spot.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.902
She seems really angry.
We... we should probably go.

16:10.904 --> 16:12.737
Go! Okay, I thought you
were giving me a hug.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.341
Oh, hey, Schmidt.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.675
Be careful, okay?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.577
There's a guy over there
that brought me flowers.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.747
I might realize that I'm in
love with him and run away.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.816
Does he come in here often?

16:26.786 --> 16:28.753
An unfortunate start.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.322
Look, I'm sorry for not
being open with you.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.425
The truth is-is
I still can't believe

16:34.427 --> 16:37.295
that you're gonna marry me.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.964
You spent the summer of 2003
at the MTV Beach House.

16:39.966 --> 16:43.134
I spent that same summer
watching<i> Felicity</i> on VHS

16:43.136 --> 16:46.604
and recording a fake radio show
where I reviewed snacks.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.642
I love you.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.745
And I know you love me.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.615
And so...

16:57.617 --> 16:58.783
(gasps)

17:09.062 --> 17:11.462
I give you my trust.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.297
You've always had it.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.632
And I don't feel the need

17:14.634 --> 17:16.234
to show the world that I own you

17:16.236 --> 17:17.668
by putting some gaudy gem
on your hand.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.537
I love you. (chuckles)

17:20.974 --> 17:22.774
Ha-ha!

17:23.910 --> 17:26.310
But you are getting me
a real ring.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.913
You're gonna have a diamond
the size of a raisin.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.148
We can go tomorrow.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.150
We'll pick it out together.
(laughs)

17:32.152 --> 17:33.184
I did that.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.520
Hey, nice job.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.255
Thank you.
Let me get you a drink.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.322
(groans)

17:38.324 --> 17:39.724
Hold on, why don't you

17:39.726 --> 17:41.659
take it easy, smush pain,
I got it.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.762

17:44.764 --> 17:47.098

18:14.027 --> 18:14.692
I know.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.828
(chuckles)

18:22.035 --> 18:23.701
Magic.
Magic! That was magic.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.203
Okay, you guys saw magic.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.438
I watched a hot girl
pour herself a drink

18:27.440 --> 18:29.640
and then leave without paying.
Wait, she left?

18:29.642 --> 18:30.875
She's a robber.

18:30.877 --> 18:31.976
Nick has a crush
on a robber.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.212
How did she leave so fast?

18:34.214 --> 18:36.280
She's amazing.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.816
Guys, we got to go get her now.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.118
Let's go.
Cece, let's go!

18:40.120 --> 18:41.285
Ah, son of a...  CECE:
Schmidt, I'm coming!

18:41.287 --> 18:42.887
SCHMIDT: Let's get her! Come on!
Let's go!

18:42.889 --> 18:44.322
Uh, you coming?

18:44.324 --> 18:45.490
Oh, I would.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.225
But I have to stay here
and eat pretzels.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.593
Okay, I'll call you with an update.
No.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.861
I'll text you with an update.
Don't.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.666
Uh, ma'am,
we're surprising her

18:55.668 --> 18:57.001
because we want her
to move in with us.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.236
See, earlier I said, "Get out!"

18:58.238 --> 18:59.904
And she did.
(Nick, Cece, Winston clamoring)

18:59.906 --> 19:02.406
Which was an embarrassing
mistake by me.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.741
I don't speak English.

19:03.743 --> 19:04.775
Oh, where are you from?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.911
Um, outside of Connecticut.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.580
NICK:
This is a good idea.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.982
Great idea.
This is a great idea.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.550
I'm very excited.
(shushing)

19:14.120 --> 19:16.954
(music playing over headphones)

19:16.956 --> 19:19.924
ALL:
We want you to move in with us!

19:21.528 --> 19:22.927
9.9 miles...

19:22.929 --> 19:24.428
This just got creepy.
Why did we do this?

19:24.430 --> 19:26.964
I personally did it because I
thought the idea was cinematic.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.366
SCHMIDT:
How loud is her music?

19:28.368 --> 19:29.867
CECE: We just have to
get out of here quickly

19:29.869 --> 19:31.602
and quietly-- we can, we
can go out the window.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.204
Nobody's going anywhere.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.605
We're not leaving without her.
I got this.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.140
Oh, no, no, no. What are you doing?
No, Nick.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.341
I got it.
Nick, don't.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.943
What are you doing?
I got it. Shh.

19:38.945 --> 19:39.777
ALL:
Nick.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.113
(music continues
over headphones)

19:42.115 --> 19:43.781
Get off me!

19:43.783 --> 19:45.550
Aw! Ooh! Nick?

19:45.552 --> 19:46.951
(Nick groaning)

19:46.953 --> 19:48.719
What are you doing here?!

19:48.721 --> 19:50.955
Thank you for the swift kick
to the face.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.891
Perhaps you want
to live in our place.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.160
(sighs) Genuinely
didn't rhyme on purpose.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.795
I think what he's trying
to say is, we want you

19:57.797 --> 19:59.297
to come live with us.  Yeah.
That's right.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.531
I'm okay here.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.366
I actually worked it out
so that I get to pick out

20:02.368 --> 20:03.668
a lobster to eat
at the end of every week.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.802
It's a sick deal.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.804
You know what's a sick deal?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.839
Friendship.
(all groan)

20:08.841 --> 20:10.608
That's an unacceptable segue.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.311
I actually like being a loner.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.313
It means fewer people
break into my hotel room.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.480
Okay, well,
if you're such a loner,

20:16.482 --> 20:18.182
then why did you help me
with Cece?

20:18.184 --> 20:19.317
I don't know.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.152
You could've left
when I kicked you out.

20:21.154 --> 20:22.587
You could've left
when you caught me

20:22.589 --> 20:23.688
beasting that hunk of cheese.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.822
That was disgusting.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.224
But you stayed.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.725
Now I'm not leaving.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.995
And Cece's not leaving
and Nick...

20:30.997 --> 20:32.463
Well, Nick
physically can't leave.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.532
Winston's not leaving.

20:34.534 --> 20:35.933
Hey, I'm Winston,
by the way.

20:35.935 --> 20:39.003
None of us are leaving until
you agree to move in with us.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.406
This is actually the kindest,

20:42.408 --> 20:45.109
creepiest thing
that a group of people

20:45.111 --> 20:47.345
I've only known for four hours
has ever done for me.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.113
Ah, screw it.

20:49.115 --> 20:52.016
I'm gonna move in! Hey! Yes!

20:52.018 --> 20:53.684
Okay, you're gonna hug?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.286
We're gonna hug? Okay.
Yeah, yeah.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.954
It's happening.  NICK: I
can't see what's going on,

20:56.956 --> 20:58.689
after being kicked in the head.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.626
But I'm picturing
a very happy scene.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.427
Hey.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.496
Hi.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.568
Oh, no!

21:10.570 --> 21:12.003
(both shouting)

21:12.972 --> 21:14.105
Help me, Reagan!

21:14.107 --> 21:16.040
I don't know
how to turn it off!

21:16.042 --> 21:18.042
Oh, my...
(both screaming)

21:18.044 --> 21:19.410
The handle--
it's too tight!

21:19.412 --> 21:20.878
REAGAN:
Let's try it together.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.880
CECE:
It's so wet. I can't,

21:22.882 --> 21:24.582
I can't get a grip on it!
No, is this, is this hot?

21:24.584 --> 21:26.384
Hmm.
Yeah, that's hot.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.219
Aah, yeah, that's hot!

21:28.221 --> 21:29.220
Oh, God, it's too
wet and slippery!

21:29.222 --> 21:30.221
No, Reagan,
just if you put your...

21:30.223 --> 21:31.222
I'm gonna use my teeth!

21:31.224 --> 21:32.657
CECE: Yeah! Okay.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.125
REAGAN:
Oh, my God, oh...!

21:34.127 --> 21:35.993
Okay.

21:35.995 --> 21:36.994
CECE:
<i> The bathroom is flooding!</i>

21:36.996 --> 21:38.963
REAGAN:
<i> Help us, you idiot!</i>
