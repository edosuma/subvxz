* Snow is fallin' down
It's Christmas time *

00:15.473 --> 00:18.935
* Giving presents
Mistletoe and wine *

[Daniella]
I always had this dream...

00:26.818 --> 00:29.779
to one day be a photographer
in New York City.

00:30.196 --> 00:33.074
[***]

00:33.116 --> 00:34.826
[shutter clicking]

00:34.868 --> 00:37.579
It took me a little longer
than expected to get here.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.872
[shutter clicking]

00:38.913 --> 00:41.416
It's been two years.

00:44.252 --> 00:47.464
And I'm not leaving
until I make my mark.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.090
[shutter clicking]

00:50.300 --> 00:53.386
Mama, uh, I'm not
coming home for Christmas.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.555
You're what?

00:55.597 --> 00:58.183
Uh, I'm-I'm not
coming home for Christmas.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.644
But...
we're the Three Musketeers!

01:01.686 --> 01:04.230
Dad, we still are.
Please don't be upset.

01:04.272 --> 01:08.401
I just-- I got handed
a huge opportunity.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.862
So, you're working
right through the holidays?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.572
Yeah.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.907
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you sooner, okay?

01:13.948 --> 01:16.743
But, okay, so this year,

01:16.785 --> 01:19.746
I'm in charge of the Lab's
Christmas fundraising program.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.414
And how does that

01:21.456 --> 01:24.918
stop you from coming back home
for Christmas?

01:24.959 --> 01:29.130
Well, Liza, my supervisor,
wants me to focus on my work.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.424
And, well, as you know,

01:31.466 --> 01:33.927
I only have a few months left
of the program,

01:33.968 --> 01:36.596
so I need to have
an impressive portfolio.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.932
Well, that's fantastic, honey.
I-I'm proud of you.

01:38.973 --> 01:39.933
[Mom whimpers]

01:39.974 --> 01:41.601
We'll miss you.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.811
A lot!

01:42.852 --> 01:43.978
I'm gonna miss you guys, too,

01:44.020 --> 01:46.731
and all of
our Christmassy traditions.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.485
Hey, um, Tanner and I are late
for our first meeting, so...

01:50.527 --> 01:52.112
Hi, guys!

01:52.153 --> 01:54.280
Dani's doing great.
She's a Christmas miracle.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.700
Okay, Papi, I love you.
I gotta go.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.618
[stammers] Honey, honey--
uh, before you go--

01:58.660 --> 02:00.912
uh, a good friend of mine

02:00.954 --> 02:03.665
from university,
uh, John Kasmerec,

02:03.707 --> 02:05.625
uh, he's asked me
to ask you a favor.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.668
Okay?

02:06.710 --> 02:07.877
His daughter

02:07.919 --> 02:09.337
just got an apartment
and, uh--

02:09.379 --> 02:11.131
very close to you--

02:11.172 --> 02:12.799
Dad, is this a set-up?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.676
Because, if I don't have time
to come home for Christmas,

02:14.718 --> 02:16.052
I definitely don't have time
to go on a date.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.513
No! No.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.932
[Dad] Y-Yeah, yeah, it's just,
honey, it's just a coffee.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.308
Just a platonic coffee.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.185
Uh, she just recently
went through a breakup,

02:24.227 --> 02:25.478
and-and her dad thinks

02:25.520 --> 02:27.647
she might be, uh,
a little lonely.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.773
Okay. Sure.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.734
Just send her my info,
but I have to go.

02:30.775 --> 02:31.776
Ciao, ciao, ciao!

02:31.818 --> 02:32.736
Ciao.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.945
[meekly] Bye.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.030
[click]

02:35.071 --> 02:36.698
Well... ahem.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.702
[shutter clicks]

02:42.495 --> 02:43.997
[knocking]

02:44.039 --> 02:45.498
How did it go?

02:45.540 --> 02:47.834
I finally reached an agreement
with the Stevens company.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.002
-Terrific.
-Yeah.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.837
And here's your next case.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.380
That's the Pellsons.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.591
These are a big fish.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.718
Now, they know
I'm retiring next year,

02:56.760 --> 02:57.969
but it's gonna be your job

02:58.011 --> 03:00.055
to convince them
to stay with the firm.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.557
Um...

03:06.394 --> 03:08.480
Of-Of course you know
that, uh,

03:08.521 --> 03:10.148
the partners and I
are absolutely thrilled

03:10.190 --> 03:11.691
with your work so far...

03:11.733 --> 03:14.277
[exhaling slowly]
Uh, I wanted to talk to you...

03:14.319 --> 03:15.695
as your dad.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.739
-Okay?
-Okay.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.409
You've had your head down
ever since broke up with Margo.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.204
You know, when I took over
from your granddad,

03:24.245 --> 03:26.039
I-I had your mom,
I had my friends,

03:26.081 --> 03:27.332
I had a support group.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.668
Sweetheart,
you gotta stop hiding away.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.878
Expand your circle of friends,
socialize maybe.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.296
Mm-hmm.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.758
I-- I...
hear what you are saying.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.470
And I agree.
I agree.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.763
Okay, honey. Good.
Very good. Very good.

03:41.805 --> 03:42.889
Okay.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.224
On another note,

03:44.265 --> 03:46.685
I understand
you have not RSVP'd

03:46.726 --> 03:49.729
to the firm's Christmas party,
so there you go.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.898
Attendance is mandatory,
and that's non-negotiable.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.692
Dad. At--

03:53.733 --> 03:56.277
This is what
I'm talking about, Amelia.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.405
I am sure
most of our biggest clients

03:58.446 --> 03:59.406
and possibly even
some of our partners

03:59.447 --> 04:01.574
haven't even met you yet.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.160
You know what?
Becoming partner's a big change.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.246
You can use this party
to introduce yourself

04:06.287 --> 04:08.123
as the newest member
of the Kasmerec family

04:08.164 --> 04:11.001
to join the firm. Yes?

04:11.042 --> 04:12.794
Let them see you
for who you are.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.922
[forced chuckle]

04:15.964 --> 04:17.090
I only need one.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.926
Oh, I think
you can find a date.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.097
Thank you.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.307
And it's, uh, semi-formal.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.645
[sighs with dread]

04:31.730 --> 04:33.398
So?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.734
How did Mom and Dad take it?

04:35.775 --> 04:38.611
[sighs] Oh,
they were disappointed,

04:38.653 --> 04:40.363
but no crying,

04:40.405 --> 04:42.198
and surprisingly little guilt,

04:42.240 --> 04:43.783
except on my end.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.909
[sighs]

04:44.951 --> 04:46.119
It's just,
I'm not sure they understand

04:46.161 --> 04:48.455
that,
while I love them immensely,

04:48.496 --> 04:50.081
I need to stay here
for Christmas,

04:50.123 --> 04:52.334
and that way I need
to, you know, focus on my work.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.836
Oh, do you wish you said
all that on your call?

04:54.878 --> 04:55.920
Yeah.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.547
It's okay.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.299
Boundaries
are super-hard to make,

04:59.341 --> 05:00.508
especially in the beginning.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.344
It's only gonna
get easier from here.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.887
Well, they're trying
to set me up

05:03.928 --> 05:05.722
with the daughter
of one of my dad's buddies,

05:05.764 --> 05:08.016
though they're pretending
they're not.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.351
-Classic!
-Ha.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.145
[shutter clicks]

05:12.187 --> 05:13.313
[Liza] Okay. So.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.981
Everyone understands

05:15.023 --> 05:18.151
that all donations received
during your fundraisers

05:18.193 --> 05:21.154
will be matched by
the Jannings Foundation,

05:21.196 --> 05:23.865
and it's very important
for our survival,

05:23.907 --> 05:26.743
so everyone has to contribute
something.

05:26.785 --> 05:30.455
Get your work to me on time
for the auction.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.917
I'm keeping my eyeball out
on every single on of you, okay?

05:33.958 --> 05:34.959
And remember,

05:35.001 --> 05:36.336
the work that you present

05:36.378 --> 05:39.381
defines the artist
that you are, okay?

05:39.422 --> 05:41.383
So, our anxious sponsors,

05:41.424 --> 05:42.759
they want to know
what you're creating

05:42.801 --> 05:44.386
with the support
that they're giving,

05:44.427 --> 05:46.596
so... no pressure!

05:46.638 --> 05:48.682
-[chuckling]
-Yes.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.267
I'm gonna hand over this meeting
to the lovely organizers--

05:51.309 --> 05:52.477
-Daniella...
-[phone buzzes]

05:52.519 --> 05:53.853
-...And Javier.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.146
All right. Thank you.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.815
[warm applause]

05:56.856 --> 05:58.400
Ahem. Dani?

05:59.109 --> 06:00.110
Yep.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.486
[chuckles]

06:01.528 --> 06:04.197
Okay, so, we have...

06:04.239 --> 06:07.117
a lot of festivities
leading to the 24th,

06:07.158 --> 06:09.411
including
the Christmas poetry slam,

06:09.452 --> 06:11.496
the Christmas karaoke--

06:11.538 --> 06:13.623
[Javier] Christmas
lantern installation.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.500
My off-Broadway play,
"Carol's Christmas Call"--

06:15.542 --> 06:17.002
-[laughter]
-Yes.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.546
And, last but not least,
the silent auction on the 24th,

06:19.587 --> 06:21.673
which will be held here.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.092
Yes, Kylie?

06:24.134 --> 06:25.719
The silent auction--
I'd love to help you out.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.388
Well, not love,
more like-- like, "strong like,"

06:28.430 --> 06:31.266
or... I'm just really happy
to volunteer.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.559
-[chuckling]
-Great.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.811
Okay, well, Daniella,
what do you think

06:34.853 --> 06:37.397
about having Kylie
as silent auction co-leader?

06:37.439 --> 06:38.732
"Team work
makes the dream work."

06:38.773 --> 06:40.150
Sure.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.651
[Javier] All right.
There you go.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.403
Okay, well,
thank you, everyone.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.904
I know I am new at this,

06:44.946 --> 06:46.281
but I am super-excited

06:46.322 --> 06:48.742
to lead everyone through
this holiday season,

06:48.783 --> 06:50.660
and if you have any issues
or concerns,

06:50.702 --> 06:52.662
don't be afraid to reach out.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.039
Okay, you're free to go.

06:54.080 --> 06:54.831
[Javier] Thanks, everyone.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.880
-Amelia?
-Okay, rude.

07:01.921 --> 07:02.964
You love me.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.299
Mm. Debatable.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.135
It's the woman
my dad wants me to meet.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.678
Ooh. She's an eager one.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.971
Tanner?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.639
I need your help.
I have, like, a million ideas.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.932
Great.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.101
What are you gonna do
for the auction?

07:15.143 --> 07:16.311
Oh, I don't know yet.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.687
Okay.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.567
Are you sure you're gonna
be able to handle all of this?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.277
Yeah. Yeah, I got
nothing but time.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.112
[forced chuckle]

07:29.324 --> 07:30.909
[shutter clicks]

07:30.950 --> 07:34.162
We could take this opportunity
to go someplace warm for once.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.957
Mm. We're fooling ourselves.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.419
She's never
missed Christmas before...

07:41.461 --> 07:43.588
not in 30 years.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.632
Or, you know, someplace cold.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.008
How about
England for Christmas?

07:48.343 --> 07:51.554
What's the point
of even decorating

07:51.596 --> 07:53.306
if she's not here?

07:53.348 --> 07:54.974
Well, I'm still here.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.018
We can do this together.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.855
[***]

08:00.897 --> 08:03.108
[click]

08:03.149 --> 08:05.402
So... who is she exactly?

08:05.443 --> 08:08.655
The daughter
of Dad's college roommate.

08:08.697 --> 08:12.575
I guess she's kind of lonely
in the big city?

08:12.617 --> 08:14.327
I get that.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.162
Ah, maybe she's cute.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.664
You deserve cute.

08:17.706 --> 08:18.665
I don't want cute.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.333
"Cute" leads to crushes

08:20.375 --> 08:22.419
and crushes
lead to crushed.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.796
I have zero time,
but I promised Dad.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.507
Oh, so, you're, uh,
you're gonna meet her?

08:27.549 --> 08:29.676
Yeah, of course,
I'm gonna meet her.

08:29.718 --> 08:34.097
We're going
to some hip place in Bushwick.

08:34.139 --> 08:37.642
Ooh! She's already taking you
out of your comfort zone.

08:37.684 --> 08:38.810
That's great!

08:38.852 --> 08:41.021
Have a little fun.
For once.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.106
I am fun!

08:43.148 --> 08:44.607
Okay? I run.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.776
I... [words catch]

08:46.818 --> 08:47.694
[sighs]

08:47.736 --> 08:49.654
I'm not ready
to date again.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.698
You know, sometimes,

08:51.740 --> 08:53.658
the universe
lends a helping hand.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.827
I truly doubt

08:55.869 --> 08:59.622
"the universe" has
anything to do with this.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.585
We'll see.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.634
You know, I have an idea.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.012
I didn't think
I could go to the symposium

09:14.054 --> 09:15.388
in New York

09:15.430 --> 09:18.433
because I assumed
Daniella would be here

09:18.475 --> 09:19.476
with us for Christmas, right?

09:19.517 --> 09:21.019
-Yeah?
-But now--

09:21.061 --> 09:22.812
No. No, no. I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.397
I could make a quick call--

09:24.439 --> 09:26.024
No, she said she was busy.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.234
...And see if they have
any available spots!

09:28.276 --> 09:29.361
Oh, no...

09:29.402 --> 09:31.154
-no, no.
-[giggles schemingly]

09:31.196 --> 09:32.864
Ah... oh.
[sighing]

09:32.906 --> 09:34.491
Oh, boy.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.909
[sighs]

09:35.950 --> 09:38.787
Okay, just
a little higher on the left.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.206
Ooh! Too far.
Down, down, down.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.665
There! There. Perfect.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.295
Wow. What do you think?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.799
Oh, it's...

09:50.840 --> 09:53.093
playful and enigmatic,
it's...

09:53.134 --> 09:54.135
quite captivating.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.261
It just draws you in.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.888
Oh, I agree.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.932
That's from Sean Tribeca's
collection.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.767
You know, it's his seventh show

10:00.809 --> 10:02.686
at the Elenor
and Jennings Gallery.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.479
He actually was here.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.231
He's a Brooklyn
Artist Lab alumni.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.274
Oh, I didn't know that.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.361
Yeah, I mean, I didn't really
think he was gonna make it,

10:11.403 --> 10:13.780
until he applied himself

10:13.822 --> 10:15.448
while he was here,
and he was awarded

10:15.490 --> 10:16.700
a travel grant,

10:16.741 --> 10:18.535
and he studied in Japan.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.911
Wow.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.705
There are a lot of
available travel grants

10:21.746 --> 10:23.581
for innovative thinkers.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.126
You could apply for one...

10:26.167 --> 10:28.753
[pointedly] ...when you get
your portfolio together.

10:29.713 --> 10:30.964
[stammers]

10:31.006 --> 10:34.342
What are you donating
to the auction,

10:34.384 --> 10:36.052
now that I'm thinking of it?

10:36.094 --> 10:39.097
You've been awfully busy with
this whole charity-week thing.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.017
I don't want you to lose focus,
creatively.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.020
Well, uh,
I'm just not ready yet.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.480
Daniella...

10:47.522 --> 10:48.773
yes, you are.

10:48.815 --> 10:49.941
I know your work.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.151
You have--
You have a good eye.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.444
You have great technique.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.904
You gotta try something
completely different.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.448
I know.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.492
[stammers] I mean, the bulk of
my commercial work is posed.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.328
Maybe something with emotion

11:02.370 --> 11:03.955
or while in motion?

11:03.997 --> 11:07.208
Whoa, that...
okay, I just got goosebumps.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.044
"Emotion while in motion."

11:09.085 --> 11:10.295
That's beautiful.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.796
Do that!

11:11.838 --> 11:14.424
-Okay.
-All right.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.676
[Amelia] Thanks, Suzie.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.678
No, that's great.
Mm-hmm.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.014
Oh, it's in the Stevens' file.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.516
Yeah, you can
just forward it to me.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.852
Mm. Thank you.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.522
-Hi.
-Oh, uh...

11:29.564 --> 11:31.733
Suzie, I have to let you go.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.152
My "4:00" is here.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.528
Merry Christmas.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.197
Bye.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.824
Hi. Amelia, right?

11:39.866 --> 11:41.242
I'm Daniella.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.161
Thank you so much
for meeting me here.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.330
[wheezing] I just got out
of a tech rehearsal

11:45.372 --> 11:46.831
and I have exactly...

11:46.873 --> 11:48.958
one hour
before I have to get back.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.252
Oh. Uh...

11:51.294 --> 11:54.714
I'll just have whatever
she's having, thank you.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.425
Oh! [exhales deeply]

11:57.467 --> 11:58.760
You don't know
what I'm having.

11:58.802 --> 12:01.179
Oh, that's the adventure of it.
I don't.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.639
[chuckles]
What-- What are you having?

12:02.681 --> 12:04.557
Coffee.

12:04.599 --> 12:05.892
Black.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.145
Okay, so,
not so adventurous.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.148
I would say "classic".

12:12.190 --> 12:13.483
Hmm.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.195
Thank you.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.114
[exhales heavily]

12:19.155 --> 12:21.491
Uh, so... Amelia?

12:21.533 --> 12:22.742
Uh...

12:22.784 --> 12:24.452
[blurts] I have friends.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.579
I'm sorry?

12:26.621 --> 12:28.123
I know that my father
told your father

12:28.164 --> 12:29.791
that I don't have any friends,

12:29.833 --> 12:31.334
but that's not true--
I have friends.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.503
Not including my dad.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.796
Cool.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.465
Yeah, for the record,
I-I also have friends.

12:37.507 --> 12:41.136
Uh, though I don't know
what your dad said about me, so.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.515
Born and raised in Hartford,
no siblings.

12:45.557 --> 12:46.433
Your parents
are recently retired--

12:46.474 --> 12:49.436
your mother, a renowned author,

12:49.477 --> 12:50.854
your father, a mathematician.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.440
You're currently attending
the Brooklyn Artist Lab,

12:53.481 --> 12:54.607
with a photography focus,

12:54.649 --> 12:56.192
and you're a Libra.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.195
Uh, yes to all.

12:59.237 --> 13:02.323
Libra sun, Cancer rising,
Pisces moon.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.160
Okay.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.876
That's a lot of peppermint
creamer, by the way.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.961
Oh, it's the best.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.297
[Daniella chuckles]

13:17.339 --> 13:18.506
Yummy.

13:21.426 --> 13:25.096
So what did your dad
tell you about me?

13:26.431 --> 13:28.975
Well... your name's Amelia.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.144
Uh, our dads
were college roommates...

13:31.186 --> 13:32.812
Yeah.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.315
And, uh, you-you recently
broke up with someone.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.526
He didn't tell me
your sign, though, but...

13:38.568 --> 13:40.445
since you can't
get over your ex,

13:40.487 --> 13:44.240
um, I'm gonna guess Scorpio--

13:44.282 --> 13:47.869
loyal, devoted,
highly sensitive to injustice.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.497
I'm right, right?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.540
Right. Scorpio.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.334
Knew it. Yep.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.418
[awkward chuckle]

13:55.460 --> 13:56.753
Can't believe my dad

13:56.795 --> 13:57.962
is telling everyone
about the breakup.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.674
-Oh--
-The decision

14:00.715 --> 14:03.259
was very mutual, by the way.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.929
We broke up almost a year ago
and I am over it.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.056
I am so over it.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.433
I'm just not ready
to start dating again,

14:10.475 --> 14:13.186
which I think
is completely natural, right?

14:13.228 --> 14:14.145
Right! Yeah.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.355
Of course.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.899
Right.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.904
Hey, so what
do you do for work?

14:22.946 --> 14:24.572
No, actually, wait.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.241
Wait. Let me guess.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.538
Investment banker?

14:31.579 --> 14:32.664
No.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.540
Ooh.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.000
Or...

14:35.041 --> 14:37.252
super-secret
undercover spy boss?

14:38.461 --> 14:40.797
[snickers]

14:40.839 --> 14:41.881
Attorney.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.049
Corporate litigation.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.384
Hey, I was really close.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.427
[laughing]

14:46.886 --> 14:49.139
Um, well, I...

14:49.180 --> 14:51.391
I used to be
a wedding photographer,

14:51.433 --> 14:54.227
uh, but now
I'm more of a visual artist,

14:54.269 --> 14:57.564
and, well, maybe I'll travel
with my photography.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.857
I hope.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.443
Mm.

15:03.111 --> 15:06.406
So... weddings, huh?

15:06.448 --> 15:07.657
Awful. Yeah.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.410
It was awful.
It was short-lived, of course.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.203
[laughing]

15:13.079 --> 15:15.165
[door bell jingles]

15:15.206 --> 15:16.875
Oh.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.293
So...

15:18.335 --> 15:21.379
Libras and Scorpios--
compatible?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.340
Not really.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.301
Well, I guess the stars
have spoken.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.264
Well, good luck
with your silent auction.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.682
Oh, thank you.

15:32.724 --> 15:33.933
Yeah. It was nice to meet you.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.770
You too.
Well, bye, Daniella.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.396
Bye, Amelia.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.231
Bye.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.820
[phone ringing]

15:45.862 --> 15:48.031
Hello, Mama. How are you?

15:48.073 --> 15:50.325
[Raquel]
Doing wonderful. How are you?

15:50.367 --> 15:51.910
Well, actually.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.287
I think this Christmas season
is gonna be good for my work.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.790
Oh. So,
your father and I decided,

15:56.831 --> 15:59.959
uh, wouldn't it be fun
to go to a writer symposium?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.836
Yeah, that's cool.
Where's this symposium?

16:01.878 --> 16:03.880
[shouts] Dani!

16:03.922 --> 16:05.674
Te amamos!

16:06.966 --> 16:09.052
[***]

16:10.387 --> 16:12.597
We found
the cutest little Airbnb

16:12.639 --> 16:14.099
just a few blocks away.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.559
[Luke] Yeah, I used my points,
and we got it for a steal.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.145
We are not here
to cramp your style in any way.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.814
We just thought, why not?

16:20.855 --> 16:22.607
Well...
you thought "why not".

16:22.649 --> 16:24.109
Dani!

16:24.150 --> 16:27.278
You haven't put any Christmas
decorations up yet?

16:28.530 --> 16:30.490
Yeah, where's
your Christmas tree, kiddo?

16:30.532 --> 16:32.534
I just took everything
to the Lab,

16:32.575 --> 16:35.328
'cause I'm gonna be spending
most of my time there, anyway.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.913
Oh...

16:36.955 --> 16:38.998
don't worry,
we can help you with that.

16:39.040 --> 16:39.916
Many hands make light work.

16:39.958 --> 16:40.834
Mm-hmm.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.545
[chuckles]

16:45.046 --> 16:46.923
Uh... you know what, Raquel?

16:46.965 --> 16:51.052
Let's, um, leave
and give Dani some space, hmm?

16:51.094 --> 16:52.429
Yes, of course.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.184
Guys, wait, um...

16:59.561 --> 17:01.271
[sighs]

17:01.312 --> 17:04.357
You know, I-I think I actually
have everything here

17:04.399 --> 17:08.194
to make our famous
McCallan family ponche crema.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.196
[parents giggling]

17:10.238 --> 17:11.865
I get everything ready!

17:11.906 --> 17:13.700
Where's the cinnamon?

17:13.742 --> 17:15.994
-In the cupboard.
-And the milk? In the fridge?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.537
Yeah, so smart, yes.

17:19.164 --> 17:22.083
[***]

17:33.011 --> 17:34.471
[confused chuckle]

17:34.512 --> 17:36.222
[phone rings]

17:39.601 --> 17:41.061
How was your date?

17:41.102 --> 17:42.812
The breakup, Dad?

17:42.854 --> 17:45.065
Who else did you tell?

17:45.106 --> 17:46.649
Oh, sweetheart.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.193
I just want you to be happy.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.613
So... was she nice?

17:52.947 --> 17:55.992
She was... very nice.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.452
And?

17:58.870 --> 18:00.830
And...

18:00.872 --> 18:02.707
it was great.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.669
The... date was great.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.629
We-- We...

18:07.671 --> 18:08.838
really hit it off.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.507
Oh, well, now, you see,

18:10.548 --> 18:12.384
you're making your old man
very happy.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.803
You gonna see her again?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.763
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:16.805 --> 18:20.058
A-- A-As soon as I-I can,
in fact.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.685
I--

18:21.726 --> 18:23.770
think we are...

18:23.812 --> 18:25.939
going to meet up tomorrow.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.649
[chuckles]

18:27.691 --> 18:29.109
All right, I just sent you

18:29.150 --> 18:30.944
some notes
on the Hernandez case,

18:30.985 --> 18:33.029
so we can get into that
tomorrow morning, all right?

18:33.071 --> 18:35.365
Okay. Sounds great, Dad. Night.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.950
-Bye-bye.
-[call ends]

18:36.991 --> 18:39.160
[***]

18:43.832 --> 18:44.791
Salud, salud.

18:44.833 --> 18:45.875
Salud.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.836
Sorry.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.170
-Salud.

18:52.048 --> 18:56.261
Okay, um, so, I have,
like, five minutes,

18:56.302 --> 18:58.138
and then I have to go
to the Lab.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.682
Now? But i-i-it's dinnertime,

19:00.724 --> 19:02.851
and we want to know
all about what happened today.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.811
Did you meet
anyone interesting?

19:04.853 --> 19:06.771
I know, I know, I'm sorry,

19:06.813 --> 19:08.523
but, I promise,
I'll be back really quick.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.733
All right,
well, let's head out.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.609
Mm-hmm. How far is the walk?

19:11.651 --> 19:14.154
Oh! No, no, no.
You-- You stay. Stay, relax.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.781
It's easier
if I go alone anyway,

19:16.823 --> 19:18.825
and that way, I can come back
as soon as I can.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.827
Yeah.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.541
Well, I guess it's us
and the ponche,huh?

19:26.583 --> 19:27.667
Mm.

19:27.709 --> 19:28.793
[smooch]

19:28.835 --> 19:30.420
[Kylie] I also have
a really cute idea

19:30.462 --> 19:32.922
for the silent auction--
custom drinks.

19:32.964 --> 19:33.923
My friend makes
this really good

19:33.965 --> 19:35.342
homemade kombucha
and matcha tea.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.927
Okay, well, maybe we can think
of something simpler,

19:37.969 --> 19:39.721
but I will add it to the list.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.183
Oh, I also took initiative
to reach out to old members

19:43.224 --> 19:45.518
willing to donate
some really, really cool stuff.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.937
Sweet! Yeah.
Have them send me everything.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.522
Cool.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.941
Uh, okay, do you want
to help me lock down a budget?

19:51.983 --> 19:53.318
Oh...

19:53.360 --> 19:55.236
I'm not really great
with budgets,

19:55.278 --> 19:57.030
or so my dad says.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.907
[laughing]

19:58.948 --> 20:00.617
Okay, well,
I can show you

20:00.658 --> 20:02.952
what I have planned
for the auction,

20:02.994 --> 20:06.122
and if you want, I can help you
with your budgets as well.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.500
Yeah! It's so great
working together.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.460
Maybe we can
collaborate sometime--

20:10.502 --> 20:12.712
my poetry,
your photography?

20:12.754 --> 20:15.006
-Really? Yeah, I'd love that.
-Mm.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.092
I didn't think
you'd be interested in--

20:17.133 --> 20:18.218
Wait.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.637
You're a Raquel McCallan fan?

20:20.679 --> 20:22.305
Yeah, the biggest.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.891
Though my Dad and I fight
over that title.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.726
She's my mom.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.478
Shut up and back it up!

20:28.520 --> 20:30.021
Your mother
is the renowned author

20:30.063 --> 20:31.523
and literature professor?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.525
Well, she doesn't teach
anymore, but yeah.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.151
Wow.

20:35.193 --> 20:36.778
You're her daughter?

20:36.820 --> 20:38.655
All my life.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.323
And you didn't want
to be a-a writer?

20:40.365 --> 20:43.326
No, no. My mom
has the lit part covered,

20:43.368 --> 20:45.662
and my dad's a math genius,

20:45.704 --> 20:48.581
so, naturally,
I chose visual arts.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.458
Forge my own path.
Hopefully.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.584
Brave.

20:51.626 --> 20:52.877
Yeah.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.631
Um, you know...

20:56.673 --> 20:58.675
she is actually
in town right now,

20:58.717 --> 21:00.260
and if you have
anything finished--

21:00.301 --> 21:01.261
-Daniella, I--
-...And you want her

21:01.302 --> 21:02.429
-to take a look--
-Oh, my gosh!

21:02.470 --> 21:03.471
-If you're interested.
-Yes! Yes, yes!

21:03.513 --> 21:05.348
Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, my gosh!

21:05.390 --> 21:06.599
I'm so glad
we're friends now.

21:06.641 --> 21:07.809
Okay.

21:07.851 --> 21:09.227
And I'm so sorry
for that embarrassing gush.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.230
Don't tell her I did that.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.898
Oh, and I forgot to mention--

21:13.940 --> 21:15.400
I took a job
choreographing a music video

21:15.442 --> 21:16.609
for the next few days,

21:16.651 --> 21:18.278
so my time will be limited.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.405
Oh. O...Okay.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.782
I-I'll just add
a few more things

21:22.824 --> 21:24.325
to my to-do list.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.248
[shutter clicks]

21:30.290 --> 21:33.043
[Dani] Oh, I'm home!

21:33.084 --> 21:34.252
You just missed them.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.712
[chuckles]

21:37.547 --> 21:40.300
Ohh...

21:40.342 --> 21:42.761
you know
that my meeting with Kylie

21:42.802 --> 21:44.012
didn't end till ten.

21:44.054 --> 21:45.221
Mm.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.431
I'm so sorry

21:46.473 --> 21:47.974
I didn't text you
about my parents.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.142
Surprise!

21:49.184 --> 21:50.018
Are you kidding?

21:50.060 --> 21:51.436
We ordered pizza,

21:51.478 --> 21:52.979
we went out
and bought some lights,

21:53.021 --> 21:54.773
and your Dad made his famous
peanut butter Christmas cookies.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.191
-Oh, ho, ho!
-I couldn't be happier.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.150
Or fuller.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.110
[phone buzzes]

22:01.363 --> 22:03.948
Oh! [laughs]

22:03.990 --> 22:05.867
[chimes]

22:07.452 --> 22:10.538
[***]

22:10.580 --> 22:13.375
[chimes]

22:15.960 --> 22:17.962
Who's that?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.006
[chimes]

22:20.048 --> 22:21.883
[chuckles]

22:23.385 --> 22:24.844
Who's that?

22:24.886 --> 22:26.805
[chimes]

22:26.846 --> 22:28.556
-Tell me.
-[laughs]

22:28.598 --> 22:30.100
[chimes]

22:30.141 --> 22:32.060
[laughs]

22:37.732 --> 22:39.734
Thank you.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.780
One plain black coffee.

22:45.824 --> 22:47.367
-[smack]
-[darkly] The hostages.

22:47.409 --> 22:50.036
Oh! How I've missed you.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.538
-[Amelia laughs]
-Perfect timing.

22:51.579 --> 22:54.374
Really, I'm going
Christmas tree shopping

22:54.416 --> 22:56.626
with my mom and dad, so...

22:56.668 --> 22:58.878
Wait. Your parents are... here?

22:58.920 --> 23:00.922
Yeah, yeah.
They surprised me yesterday.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.842
That is surprising.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.386
My mom's here
for some writing thing

23:06.428 --> 23:08.930
and, I don't know,
they just look so happy,

23:08.972 --> 23:12.934
and I have a lot on my plate,
so I don't know what to do.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.104
They, um...

23:16.146 --> 23:18.106
your parents didn't mention

23:18.148 --> 23:20.400
if they talked to my dad,
did they?

23:20.442 --> 23:21.359
-[chuckles awkwardly]
-[Luke] Hey, Dani!

23:21.401 --> 23:22.902
-I'm sure it's probably...

23:22.944 --> 23:24.237
nothing, but, um...

23:24.279 --> 23:26.156
Hola, mi hija!

23:26.197 --> 23:27.365
[hushed] We need to talk!

23:27.407 --> 23:29.075
- Hola...
-Hola.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.162
Mama-- uh, guys, I told you
to meet me here in 30 minutes.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.413
You're 29 minutes early.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.498
We wanted
to check the neighborhood,

23:35.540 --> 23:37.250
and we didn't want
to miss the meeting.

23:37.292 --> 23:38.376
Amelia. Hello!

23:38.418 --> 23:40.086
Oh, hello.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.129
Hi, Mr. McCallan.

23:41.171 --> 23:42.964
"Luke". Please.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.132
Luke.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.133
I'm Raquel.

23:45.175 --> 23:46.926
-Hi.
-Lovely to meet you.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.386
Your dad said you two
were really hitting it off,

23:48.428 --> 23:50.347
and it looks like
he was right.

23:50.388 --> 23:52.599
Mm-hmm! I assume
you're coming with us

23:52.640 --> 23:54.392
to the Christmas tree lot, hmm?

23:54.434 --> 23:55.226
Yes. Please say yes.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.519
[awkward chuckle]

23:56.561 --> 23:58.438
I do love Christmas trees.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.273
[Luke] Fantastic.
Sounds like a "yes" to me.

24:00.315 --> 24:01.733
Dani, could I...

24:01.775 --> 24:03.109
borrow you
for a quick second?

24:04.235 --> 24:06.404
Uh... okay. Y-Yeah. Um...

24:06.446 --> 24:08.782
[speaks Spanish]

24:08.823 --> 24:10.575
We'll be here.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.411
What's happening?

24:13.453 --> 24:15.914
I think our dads talked
or texted, or something.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.374
About what?

24:17.415 --> 24:19.542
Well...

24:19.584 --> 24:22.128
[***]

24:22.170 --> 24:23.963
So, here's the situation.

24:24.005 --> 24:25.465
My dad--

24:25.507 --> 24:27.759
we were chatting yesterday
and I...

24:27.801 --> 24:28.968
perhaps...

24:29.010 --> 24:31.137
let him think
that maybe you and I...

24:31.179 --> 24:32.555
got along

24:32.597 --> 24:33.807
far better
than we did.

24:33.848 --> 24:35.350
What? Why?
Why would you tell him that?

24:35.392 --> 24:36.810
I don't know.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.353
I regretted it
as soon as I said it.

24:38.395 --> 24:40.480
-Wha--
-It just... slipped out.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.565
My had has been
so disappointed

24:42.607 --> 24:45.610
ever since my last relationship
ended with my ex, Margo.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.404
I didn't want him to worry,
so...

24:47.445 --> 24:49.155
I told him
that the coffee was a date

24:49.197 --> 24:50.156
and the date was great.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.366
Wait, wait, wait.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.202
So you-- you fake-dated us
to your father?

24:55.370 --> 24:56.496
Technically, yes.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.081
-[astonished laugh]
-I had no idea

24:58.123 --> 24:59.916
the parental gossip pipeline
was so connected!

25:01.084 --> 25:03.003
[***]

25:03.044 --> 25:04.337
[sighs heavily]

25:04.379 --> 25:05.755
Which means your parents--

25:05.797 --> 25:07.549
My parents think
we're dating, too.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.051
-Yep.
-Oh...

25:10.093 --> 25:11.136
My apologies.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.013
I am normally
more rational than this.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.639
I'll go explain
it was a miscommunication.

25:14.681 --> 25:15.557
[quickly] Or--

25:15.598 --> 25:16.808
-...wait.
-What?

25:17.934 --> 25:19.102
I mean...

25:19.144 --> 25:21.354
would it be so wrong
if we didn't clarify?

25:21.396 --> 25:22.689
Right away?

25:22.731 --> 25:26.526
Maybe we could ride
this "miscommunication"

25:26.568 --> 25:28.069
till Christmas Eve?

25:28.111 --> 25:30.030
I'm listening.

25:30.071 --> 25:32.073
Well, what if...

25:32.115 --> 25:34.993
someonehad her parents
show up out of nowhere

25:35.035 --> 25:36.870
and she would really

25:36.911 --> 25:39.539
appreciate
a-a charming plus-one this week

25:39.581 --> 25:41.041
for a series
of Christmas events,

25:41.082 --> 25:44.461
because I'm-- she...
is already very, very busy?

25:44.502 --> 25:46.463
Huh. Interesting.

25:46.504 --> 25:47.422
Mm-hmm?

25:47.464 --> 25:48.381
Okay.

25:48.423 --> 25:50.216
Well, what if...

25:50.258 --> 25:52.886
someone else...

25:52.927 --> 25:55.472
was in dire need
of a "charming plus-one"

25:55.513 --> 25:57.557
to a very important
law firm Christmas party?

25:57.599 --> 25:58.808
Also interesting.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.393
Mm-hmm!

26:00.435 --> 26:03.772
Would... someone perhaps have
something semi-formal to wear?

26:05.190 --> 26:06.441
Y-Yeah. I'm-I'm pretty sure

26:06.483 --> 26:07.734
someone could
figure that one out.

26:07.776 --> 26:08.735
Mm.

26:08.777 --> 26:10.070
I mean, and ultimately,

26:10.111 --> 26:11.571
nothing is more important
to children

26:11.613 --> 26:13.031
than seeing their parents happy.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.741
Yeah. Absolutely.
I mean, I'm-I'm pretty sure

26:14.783 --> 26:16.451
it's actually
an established fact--

26:16.493 --> 26:17.535
like, gravity,

26:17.577 --> 26:18.620
or Taylor Swift being

26:18.661 --> 26:20.413
the greatest
modern singer-songwriter.

26:20.455 --> 26:21.915
Oh?

26:21.956 --> 26:23.917
[sighs]
Yeah. This is perfect.

26:23.958 --> 26:26.795
It means that your dad
relaxes about your love life,

26:26.836 --> 26:28.421
and I get a little bit
of breathing room.

26:28.463 --> 26:30.006
[exhales dramatically]

26:30.048 --> 26:31.508
Yeah.

26:31.549 --> 26:32.926
I'm in.

26:32.967 --> 26:35.512
What do you think
they're talking about?

26:35.553 --> 26:37.097
Maybe us?

26:37.138 --> 26:39.182
It is awfully early
for introductions to parents.

26:39.224 --> 26:40.517
Mm.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.102
Even for lesbians?

26:42.143 --> 26:43.186
Oh...

26:43.228 --> 26:44.896
yes.

26:44.938 --> 26:46.314
Hmm.

26:46.356 --> 26:48.108
[exhales] Okay, so...

26:48.149 --> 26:49.275
we're doing this?

26:49.317 --> 26:50.777
We are.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.576
[Luke] Listen.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.412
The best Christmas sweaters
are made with...?

27:00.453 --> 27:01.788
What?

27:01.830 --> 27:03.581
[Luke]
"Fleece Navidad."

27:03.623 --> 27:06.167
[Luke chuckles]

27:06.209 --> 27:08.586
We're going to grab
something to drink.

27:08.628 --> 27:09.504
Would you like something?

27:09.546 --> 27:10.714
Yeah, your usual?

27:10.755 --> 27:12.215
Uh, hot chocolate,
double peppermint?

27:12.257 --> 27:14.300
Yeah. That's
Amelia's favorite, too.

27:14.342 --> 27:15.468
-Ooh!
-Look at that!

27:15.510 --> 27:17.137
[forced] Mm-hmm.

27:17.178 --> 27:19.639
"Yummy".

27:19.681 --> 27:21.057
[aghast] Double peppermint?

27:21.099 --> 27:22.100
Aw, you'll learn to love it.

27:22.142 --> 27:24.144
-[snapping]
-[sighing]

27:24.185 --> 27:27.856
So, do you always
have your camera with you?

27:27.897 --> 27:29.941
Ah, sort of.

27:29.983 --> 27:31.943
It's like an extension of me.

27:31.985 --> 27:34.029
My other heart.

27:35.113 --> 27:38.658
And how do I see
some of these photographs?

27:38.700 --> 27:40.410
[snapping]

27:40.452 --> 27:41.870
Uh, well...

27:41.911 --> 27:45.749
they live undeveloped
in the top drawer of my desk.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.292
What? Why?

27:47.334 --> 27:49.878
[chuckles]
How much time do you have?

27:49.919 --> 27:51.713
This good?

27:51.755 --> 27:52.797
-Mm.
-Okay.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.216
Tell me.

27:55.258 --> 27:57.218
Oh. Well...

27:57.260 --> 28:00.388
after high school,
I-I flew through my MFA.

28:00.430 --> 28:04.100
I was proud of
what I was creating, but...

28:04.142 --> 28:05.852
I don't know,
after college,

28:05.894 --> 28:07.687
I-- I worked odd jobs

28:07.729 --> 28:11.483
in advertising and campaigns
and...

28:11.524 --> 28:14.027
I made a pretty good living
in Hartford.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.863
I made money, but...

28:16.905 --> 28:19.199
I was creatively unfulfilled.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.409
Yes, the curse
of the golden handcuffs.

28:21.451 --> 28:22.911
[snapping]

28:22.952 --> 28:24.496
-Exactly.
-Mm-hmm.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.039
So...

28:26.081 --> 28:29.417
I, um, decided to submit
my college portfolio

28:29.459 --> 28:32.712
to Liza,
my Lab advisor,

28:32.754 --> 28:36.549
and I couldn't believe I got in,
honestly,

28:36.591 --> 28:38.051
but now that I'm here,

28:38.093 --> 28:39.636
I just feel like
I don't measure up.

28:41.221 --> 28:44.099
That instinctive side of me
is just gone.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.853
Well...

28:48.895 --> 28:52.524
perhaps not gone,
but maybe different...

28:52.565 --> 28:54.567
because you're different.

28:56.945 --> 28:59.072
You're very intuitive
for a suit.

29:00.031 --> 29:01.616
All lawyers can read minds.

29:01.658 --> 29:02.575
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

29:02.617 --> 29:04.953
Can you read mine?

29:06.204 --> 29:07.622
Yes.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.207
This is your favorite tree.

29:09.249 --> 29:10.625
[laughing]

29:10.667 --> 29:11.751
Yes, actually!

29:11.793 --> 29:13.545
[chuckling]

29:13.586 --> 29:14.963
[snap]

29:17.090 --> 29:20.385
[sighs] Okay.
This is the one. Let's go.

29:20.427 --> 29:21.511
What's that?

29:21.553 --> 29:23.596
Oh, yeah, we're--
we have to pick it up.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.432
Just grab the back.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.225
-Okay.
-Yeah.

29:28.476 --> 29:29.519
Got it?

29:29.561 --> 29:30.687
Yep.

29:30.729 --> 29:32.772
Not bad.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.941
So, I was thinking--

29:34.983 --> 29:36.568
we should talk about
social media.

29:36.609 --> 29:37.861
Okay.

29:37.902 --> 29:40.405
I mean,
we should follow each other.

29:40.447 --> 29:43.158
Our dads will be looking
at everything we post.

29:43.199 --> 29:45.702
Ooh. Yeah. Actually...

29:45.744 --> 29:47.370
-Tree down, tree down.
-Okay.

29:47.412 --> 29:48.621
-Pfft.
-Ah.

29:48.663 --> 29:50.373
We should take

29:50.415 --> 29:52.000
a selfie

29:52.042 --> 29:53.918
and make it official.
Right?

29:53.960 --> 29:55.086
Oh!

29:55.128 --> 29:56.629
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh...

29:56.671 --> 29:59.799
I-I haven't really posted much
since Margo and I broke up.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.009
-Oh.
-Um...

30:01.051 --> 30:03.261
you know what? No.

30:03.303 --> 30:05.680
Never mind.
Let's... Let's do it.

30:05.722 --> 30:06.890
Are you sure?

30:06.931 --> 30:08.475
I mean, hey, if you want
to talk about it,

30:08.516 --> 30:10.810
I'm not just a fake girlfriend,
I'm a pretty good listener.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.270
Thank you.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.314
It's a story for another day.

30:14.356 --> 30:16.191
Okay. Well...

30:16.232 --> 30:17.317
Okay.

30:17.359 --> 30:19.486
'Kay. Ready?

30:19.527 --> 30:21.488
Yeah.

30:21.529 --> 30:22.697
[snap]

30:22.739 --> 30:24.115
Okay, no,
let's take another one.

30:24.157 --> 30:26.409
Just smile--
like, happy.

30:26.451 --> 30:27.369
-[laughs]
-Yeah.

30:28.953 --> 30:30.497
[snapping]

30:30.538 --> 30:33.208
[***]

30:35.460 --> 30:37.379
[snap]

30:38.380 --> 30:39.589
Convincing.

30:39.631 --> 30:41.675
It's good.
It's a good one.

30:41.716 --> 30:43.802
[music plays quietly]

30:43.843 --> 30:44.886
[voices in hallway]

30:44.928 --> 30:47.180
Daniella Alexis McCallan!

30:47.222 --> 30:48.390
[indistinct exchange]

30:48.431 --> 30:49.516
Daniella!

30:49.557 --> 30:51.476
-[singing]
-[sternly] Daniella! Hey!

30:51.518 --> 30:53.019
-Hi! We have a tree.
-I've been calling you.

30:53.061 --> 30:54.521
And texting.
We have a situation.

30:54.562 --> 30:55.647
-What?
-Come on.

30:55.689 --> 30:57.357
[indistinct exchange]

30:57.399 --> 30:59.025
Nylah called, donations
have been arriving at the Lab.

30:59.067 --> 31:00.151
I've been trying to find you.

31:00.193 --> 31:01.194
That's amazing!

31:01.236 --> 31:03.196
Here we go, all right--

31:03.238 --> 31:05.573
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Whoa, watch the branches.

31:05.615 --> 31:07.951
Okay, straight up.

31:07.992 --> 31:09.077
[Dani] I'm sorry.

31:09.119 --> 31:10.662
We gotta hurry, though.

31:10.704 --> 31:13.665
We don't want the donations
to sit outside too long.

31:13.707 --> 31:15.041
How much do you think we got?

31:15.083 --> 31:17.794
So many. 50?

31:17.836 --> 31:19.754
Okay. Oh, um,
you guys, I'm sorry,

31:19.796 --> 31:20.880
but I have to go to the Lab.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.382
I'm really sorry, but, um,

31:22.424 --> 31:23.883
we're gonna have to decorate
the tree later,

31:23.925 --> 31:26.011
so let's go.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.637
Oh, you mean--

31:27.679 --> 31:28.722
you mean us?

31:28.763 --> 31:30.473
We are going with you?

31:31.766 --> 31:33.226
Um, hold on.

31:34.853 --> 31:37.731
Why don't you two go to the Lab
and I'll stay with your parents?

31:37.772 --> 31:39.399
-Really?
-Yeah.

31:39.441 --> 31:41.234
-Don't worry about it. Yeah.
-Okay. Thank you.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.528
Um, okay,
so I'll see you guys later.

31:43.570 --> 31:44.738
Let's go. Ciao!

31:44.779 --> 31:45.905
[Tanner] You go ahead.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.157
I have to pick up
a couple of speakers.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.491
-[Dani] It's okay. I can manage.
-Let's decorate!

31:48.533 --> 31:50.326
Whoo-hoo! [laughs]

31:50.368 --> 31:51.828
Okay...

31:51.870 --> 31:53.830
[***]

31:53.872 --> 31:56.374
[Kylie] Daniella!
You're here.

31:57.292 --> 31:58.585
I have something for you.

31:58.626 --> 31:59.544
[chimes]

31:59.586 --> 32:01.629
What's that?

32:01.671 --> 32:04.174
It's old-fashioned,
but I remember your mom saying

32:04.215 --> 32:06.259
she only reads material
that's printed off

32:06.301 --> 32:07.260
and not on the screen,

32:07.302 --> 32:09.179
so, this... is my book.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.972
Well, the first part.

32:11.014 --> 32:12.766
-There's more?
-[text dings]

32:12.807 --> 32:15.393
I thought you were a poet?

32:15.435 --> 32:16.936
I'm so nervous right now.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.230
Narrative fiction
is so new to me.

32:19.272 --> 32:22.275
But I'm also really excited,
but also really nervous.

32:22.317 --> 32:24.402
It's like
the night before Christmas.

32:25.779 --> 32:28.156
[grunts]

32:30.867 --> 32:32.202
[tapping keys distractedly]

32:33.578 --> 32:35.497
[typing quickly]

32:39.250 --> 32:40.627
[line rings]

32:42.545 --> 32:45.173
[ringing]

32:48.468 --> 32:49.886
[Amelia] Hello, Ms. McCallan.

32:49.928 --> 32:51.971
Why, hello there,
Ms. Kasmerec.

32:52.013 --> 32:53.348
How are you?

32:54.349 --> 32:57.268
I need a plus-one favor.

32:57.310 --> 33:00.438
I told my dad we were
hanging out tomorrow night

33:00.480 --> 33:03.149
because I'm trying to get out
of a client meeting.

33:03.191 --> 33:05.193
Oh! Playing hooky again?

33:05.235 --> 33:06.736
You're a bad influence.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.154
[Dani laughs]

33:08.196 --> 33:09.489
Well, I do have to attend

33:09.531 --> 33:11.116
this Christmas event
at the Lab.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.325
My parents know I'll be there.

33:12.367 --> 33:14.077
Do you want to come?

33:14.119 --> 33:16.162
There's gonna be
pretty good music

33:16.204 --> 33:17.872
and Tanner
is going all out, so.

33:19.541 --> 33:20.625
[exhales deeply]

33:20.667 --> 33:22.043
Sounds great.

33:22.085 --> 33:23.378
Great.

33:23.420 --> 33:24.921
I'll-- I'll see you there.

33:24.963 --> 33:27.215
See you then.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.719
[***]

33:32.971 --> 33:34.222
[chuckles]

33:39.686 --> 33:41.896
[sighs]

33:41.938 --> 33:43.440
Pretty tired, huh?

33:43.481 --> 33:46.234
I saw what time
you got home last night, lady.

33:46.276 --> 33:49.112
I'm so glad you took my advice
and had a restful evening,

33:49.154 --> 33:52.073
decorating the tree,
working on your photography.

33:52.115 --> 33:54.242
I like being of service,
Tanner.

33:54.284 --> 33:55.368
Hey, I know you do.

33:55.410 --> 33:57.203
-But I'm worried about you.
-Don't be.

33:57.245 --> 33:58.663
I have enough people
worried about me.

33:58.705 --> 34:00.790
Mm.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.543
So...

34:03.585 --> 34:05.003
Amelia?

34:05.045 --> 34:06.588
Yes?

34:06.629 --> 34:08.089
-Any chance you two could--
-No.

34:08.131 --> 34:09.924
Oh.

34:09.966 --> 34:11.468
-[text dings]
-Mm, speaking of which--

34:12.635 --> 34:13.845
Oh, it's just Kylie.

34:13.887 --> 34:15.889
Hmph! Aw!
Disappointed, are we?

34:17.098 --> 34:19.351
Of course not.
No, this is good.

34:19.392 --> 34:21.102
She just sent me the address

34:21.144 --> 34:23.063
to pick up a donation
for the silent auction,

34:23.104 --> 34:24.481
so I should focus on that.

34:24.522 --> 34:26.399
Okay. Focus on that.

34:26.441 --> 34:28.151
I am.

34:29.652 --> 34:32.072
[***]

34:33.281 --> 34:35.950
I'm sorry. What?

34:35.992 --> 34:38.745
I don't talk to you
for 24 hours,

34:38.787 --> 34:41.539
and now you're fake-dating
a girl you just met?

34:41.581 --> 34:44.751
Her name is Daniella,

34:44.793 --> 34:46.378
and all I have to do

34:46.419 --> 34:48.630
is hang out with her
and her parents a few times.

34:48.672 --> 34:50.965
Just a short
Christmas contract.

34:51.007 --> 34:53.343
Mm, that's so romantic.

34:53.385 --> 34:56.137
[phone rings]

34:56.179 --> 34:57.639
Ahem.

34:57.681 --> 34:59.307
Hi there, Daniella.

34:59.349 --> 35:00.517
Hey! Do you have a car?

35:00.558 --> 35:02.394
I need to pick up
a donation in Long Island.

35:02.435 --> 35:04.521
Long Island?

35:07.190 --> 35:11.319
Quinn, may I borrow your minivan
for a quick errand?

35:11.361 --> 35:12.570
Mm-hmm.

35:14.322 --> 35:17.117
I named him Bedford--
for the neighborhood.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.368
I worked on him all year.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.995
I started right after
last year's auction.

35:21.037 --> 35:24.416
He is stuffed
with recycled plastic bags

35:24.457 --> 35:25.709
[Dani laughs]

35:25.750 --> 35:27.919
He's incredible!

35:27.961 --> 35:29.212
And enormous.

35:29.254 --> 35:30.797
Thank you so much, Ms. Visser.

35:30.839 --> 35:32.257
This is very generous.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.175
I know what it's like
to be an artist.

35:34.217 --> 35:37.345
I was a dancer myself,
back in the day.

35:37.387 --> 35:39.097
I performed
for Radio City Music Hall.

35:39.139 --> 35:41.266
-Wow!
-Incredible.

35:41.307 --> 35:44.519
Okay. You grab the head,
I'll grab the legs.

35:44.561 --> 35:46.271
-Okay.
-Ready?

35:46.312 --> 35:48.398
Okay.

35:49.566 --> 35:51.026
Three, two, one--

35:51.067 --> 35:52.360
-[grunting]
-Good?

35:52.402 --> 35:54.320
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Stepping.

35:54.362 --> 35:56.489
Oh... it's heavy.

35:56.531 --> 35:58.074
Anything for the arts!

35:58.116 --> 35:59.409
[Dani, laughing]
Thank you!

35:59.451 --> 36:01.911
[***]

36:03.413 --> 36:05.290
Ah! Okay.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.875
[wheezing]

36:06.916 --> 36:08.585
If this is how my story ends,

36:08.626 --> 36:10.712
promise me you'll come up
with a better ending!

36:10.754 --> 36:11.880
I like this ending,

36:11.921 --> 36:13.548
but you're graceful--
I can see it.

36:13.590 --> 36:14.799
Step.

36:14.841 --> 36:17.052
Well, lawyers do love to dance.

36:17.093 --> 36:18.136
Okay, when is that again,
your work party?

36:18.178 --> 36:20.138
-[wheezing]
-Step.

36:20.180 --> 36:21.431
Saturday.

36:21.473 --> 36:22.390
This Saturday?

36:22.432 --> 36:23.391
Step.

36:23.433 --> 36:24.559
Yeah.

36:24.601 --> 36:25.977
Do you want to just meet there?

36:26.019 --> 36:28.813
Uh-huh-- step!
Uh, yeah, yeah, that works.

36:28.855 --> 36:29.898
One more.

36:29.939 --> 36:31.191
[both grunting]

36:31.232 --> 36:31.983
Okay, my legs are giving out.
One second.

36:32.025 --> 36:33.610
Okay, okay. Ready?

36:33.651 --> 36:35.487
[both grunting with relief]

36:35.528 --> 36:37.155
[cracking up]

36:37.197 --> 36:38.948
[sighing]

36:38.990 --> 36:41.493
Why did you ask me again?

36:41.534 --> 36:44.162
Well, I do have to get you
"back out into the world,"

36:44.204 --> 36:45.413
you know?

36:45.455 --> 36:47.207
Plus, you're the only other
person I knew

36:47.248 --> 36:49.751
that could possibly
have access to a van.

36:49.793 --> 36:50.752
Oh, how thoughtful.

36:50.794 --> 36:52.671
Yeah. [laughing]

36:54.297 --> 36:56.633
I should really get
back to the office.

36:56.675 --> 36:58.218
You got it from here?

36:58.259 --> 36:59.636
Oh, I sure do, sweetie.

36:59.678 --> 37:00.929
-Oh!
-Thank you...

37:00.970 --> 37:03.098
for coming to my rescue today.

37:03.139 --> 37:05.350
Well, you make it
so easy to do.

37:05.392 --> 37:07.477
[laughing]

37:07.519 --> 37:08.895
What a beautiful bear!

37:08.937 --> 37:10.146
Thank you so much.

37:10.188 --> 37:11.856
Sorry for texting you
so last-minute.

37:11.898 --> 37:13.233
Oh, no, it's okay.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.442
Oh, Kylie.

37:14.484 --> 37:15.985
This is Amelia.

37:16.027 --> 37:17.404
She saved me

37:17.445 --> 37:19.406
from having to take this guy
on the subway today.

37:19.447 --> 37:20.490
Amelia, hi.

37:20.532 --> 37:21.658
I'm Kylie,

37:21.700 --> 37:22.951
soon-to-be fabulous writer,
influencer,

37:22.992 --> 37:24.202
visual artiste,
and more.

37:24.244 --> 37:26.287
I'm sure
you've seen my viral video.

37:26.329 --> 37:29.833
Oh, I-I don't think have,
but it-it's nice to meet you.

37:29.874 --> 37:31.001
Same.

37:31.042 --> 37:32.377
Okay. Gotta go.

37:32.419 --> 37:34.004
Bye.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.425
She will love this, huh?

37:38.466 --> 37:39.843
-Yeah.
-Mm.

37:39.884 --> 37:41.886
Ah, Daniella!
You're on time.

37:41.928 --> 37:42.971
Mm-hmm.

37:43.013 --> 37:44.806
We're cooking your favorite--

37:44.848 --> 37:48.143
brisket with carrots, potatoes,
and Brussels sprouts.

37:48.184 --> 37:49.102
Wow.

37:49.144 --> 37:50.895
Thanks, you guys.

37:50.937 --> 37:52.147
Smells good, yeah?

37:52.188 --> 37:53.690
Well, I'm-I'm actually
already late

37:53.732 --> 37:55.442
for my karaoke date
with Amelia.

37:55.483 --> 37:58.611
I just have to change
and get going. Sorry.

37:59.654 --> 38:02.157
Huh. Ah.

38:02.198 --> 38:04.909
I guess it's just us, amor.

38:04.951 --> 38:06.036
Hmm.

38:06.077 --> 38:07.662
What should we do?

38:07.704 --> 38:09.330
Hmm?

38:09.372 --> 38:13.752
[***]

38:16.087 --> 38:18.298
[Raquel giggling]

38:19.549 --> 38:22.010
[laughing]

38:22.052 --> 38:23.928
Oh, Mr. McCallan...

38:23.970 --> 38:26.473
you old romantic!

38:26.514 --> 38:28.099
[chuckling]

38:28.141 --> 38:30.727
[***]

38:33.396 --> 38:34.564
Hi. Welcome.

38:35.857 --> 38:36.983
Thanks for coming. Enjoy.

38:37.025 --> 38:39.194
[indistinct chatter]

38:42.822 --> 38:44.032
Psst.

38:44.074 --> 38:44.991
-Hi!
-Hi.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.910
Oh. Thank you.

38:46.951 --> 38:49.371
Hey, have you picked a song yet?

38:49.412 --> 38:51.873
"I Want
A Hippopotamus For Christmas"?

38:51.915 --> 38:54.125
Oh... you won't
see me on that stage.

38:54.167 --> 38:55.627
Oh, come on!

38:55.669 --> 38:57.003
Okay, everybody.

38:57.045 --> 38:58.797
We will be up and running
in just a few minutes.

38:58.838 --> 39:01.841
Thank you all for coming--
all proceeds go to the Lab!

39:01.883 --> 39:02.759
[cheering]

39:06.471 --> 39:07.222
Amelia.

39:07.263 --> 39:08.223
-You made it.
-Oh--

39:08.264 --> 39:09.557
I'm sure Dani told you

39:09.599 --> 39:11.142
about our "Light the Lab"
installation tomorrow?

39:11.184 --> 39:13.061
Then you can come
and help us make lanterns.

39:13.103 --> 39:15.438
Um, Amelia has a client dinner
tomorrow night,

39:15.480 --> 39:17.649
but, hey, I'm sure
you could pop by

39:17.691 --> 39:18.942
for a bit after, right, hun?

39:18.983 --> 39:21.152
Oh, absolutely, babe.

39:21.194 --> 39:23.905
I'm taking a client
to The Star and Goat.

39:23.947 --> 39:26.324
It's my favorite restaurant
in the city.

39:26.366 --> 39:28.618
No way. It's so hard
to get a reservation there.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.578
One time, this cutie
I was dating took me.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.747
Oh, she had
the most adorable laugh.

39:32.789 --> 39:34.165
Her name was Margo.

39:34.207 --> 39:36.209
Met her through
a friend of a friend. Mm.

39:36.251 --> 39:38.294
I really thought we connected,
but then she ghosted me.

39:39.629 --> 39:41.089
Um...

39:41.131 --> 39:43.758
Margo... Mallory?

39:43.800 --> 39:45.218
Yes!

39:45.260 --> 39:47.012
Well, technically, not ghosted.
She moved away.

39:47.053 --> 39:49.431
Yeah, West Hollywood
was calling Margo's name,

39:49.472 --> 39:51.391
and who was I to try
and stop her, right?

39:51.433 --> 39:52.934
Okay, blah,
blah-blah, blah-blah.

39:52.976 --> 39:53.977
Kylie,
you're oversharing again.

39:54.019 --> 39:56.104
Well, I'm sure

39:56.146 --> 39:58.106
the Christmas lantern party
will be great.

39:58.148 --> 39:59.399
[Tanner]
Attention, artists!

39:59.441 --> 40:00.608
We are now up and running.

40:00.650 --> 40:01.860
Whoo!

40:01.901 --> 40:03.611
I'm so excited
for you all tonight.

40:03.653 --> 40:05.697
And I want to welcome
to the stage,

40:05.739 --> 40:07.198
our very first double act--

40:08.199 --> 40:10.493
...Dani and Amelia!

40:10.535 --> 40:11.786
[cheering]

40:11.828 --> 40:12.829
[applause continues]

40:12.871 --> 40:13.663
No.

40:16.708 --> 40:17.834
Just go to the next one.

40:17.876 --> 40:19.294
All right, then.
Let's move on.

40:19.336 --> 40:22.380
-Kylie Cooke!
-Amelia, are you okay?

40:23.840 --> 40:24.966
Uh... ahem.

40:25.008 --> 40:27.093
Yeah, just...

40:27.135 --> 40:29.137
it was a lot,

40:29.179 --> 40:31.014
hearing Margo's name
so out of context,

40:31.056 --> 40:34.976
and that she's moving--
she's moved...

40:35.018 --> 40:36.728
half-way across the country.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.646
Oh, you didn't know?

40:39.773 --> 40:42.359
We don't talk.

40:44.027 --> 40:45.445
Thanks for checking on me.

40:45.487 --> 40:46.821
Of course.

40:46.863 --> 40:48.698
And if it's okay with you,

40:48.740 --> 40:49.783
I've had a long day.

40:49.824 --> 40:52.243
I don't feel much like
heading back in.

40:52.285 --> 40:53.995
Oh, come on.
It could be fun.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.747
But you should.

40:55.789 --> 40:57.332
These are your people.

40:57.374 --> 40:59.501
I don't...
really fit in here.

40:59.542 --> 41:02.671
What? That's not true.
I mean...

41:02.712 --> 41:03.963
Yeah.

41:05.298 --> 41:06.466
[Dani] I'll see you tomorrow.

41:16.101 --> 41:17.227
Daniella...

41:17.268 --> 41:19.354
I thought
I'd check in on you.

41:19.396 --> 41:20.647
I haven't seen

41:20.689 --> 41:22.440
what you're donating
for the silent auction.

41:22.482 --> 41:24.984
Yeah, Liza, I...

41:25.026 --> 41:26.486
I'm still struggling.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.613
I-I have done a few things,

41:28.655 --> 41:30.490
but nothing's sparked.

41:30.532 --> 41:32.951
Honestly, I don't really know
what my purpose is.

41:32.992 --> 41:36.329
That's the whole point
of being at the Lab--

41:36.371 --> 41:38.957
figuring it out,
letting it unfold.

41:38.998 --> 41:43.086
I really liked your idea--
"emotion with motion".

41:43.128 --> 41:45.338
If you want a shot
at the travel grant,

41:45.380 --> 41:46.923
go and do it!

41:54.097 --> 41:55.306
[snapping]

41:57.726 --> 41:59.185
[Amelia] Come here often?

41:59.227 --> 42:01.021
[laughing]

42:01.062 --> 42:03.106
From time to time.

42:03.148 --> 42:04.274
You?

42:04.315 --> 42:05.483
Every other day.

42:05.525 --> 42:07.777
My apartment's
around the block.

42:07.819 --> 42:09.279
Oh.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.238
You capture
anything interesting?

42:10.280 --> 42:11.406
Hmm.

42:11.448 --> 42:12.949
[snap]

42:12.991 --> 42:15.160
[laughs]
Smooth.

42:15.201 --> 42:18.079
Ooh, I don't think anyone has
ever called me "smooth" before.

42:19.330 --> 42:21.458
Well, maybe I inspire you.

42:21.499 --> 42:23.585
[chuckling]

42:24.627 --> 42:26.463
Is everything okay?

42:26.504 --> 42:30.216
Yeah, I just, uh,
I have to get to work.

42:30.258 --> 42:33.053
I keep procrastinating.

42:33.094 --> 42:35.096
I have to sit at my desk
long enough

42:35.138 --> 42:36.681
to open the drawer

42:36.723 --> 42:38.725
in which I have
many, many rolls of film,

42:38.767 --> 42:40.685
develop them,
see what I got,

42:40.727 --> 42:42.645
and then I would actually
have to look at them, and...

42:42.687 --> 42:45.815
[takes a tense breath, sighs]

42:45.857 --> 42:49.736
I mean, my parents are both
so accomplished in their fields,

42:49.778 --> 42:53.239
and I-- I just feel
like a failure.

42:53.281 --> 42:57.494
I mean, what if there's no place
for me in New York?

42:57.535 --> 43:00.205
What if I'm not
the artist I thought I was?

43:01.623 --> 43:04.042
There is a place
for you here

43:04.084 --> 43:05.877
because you're here.

43:07.128 --> 43:09.047
You are creating art.

43:09.089 --> 43:10.757
You're an artist.

43:10.799 --> 43:13.927
Will there be roadblocks
and rejections along the way?

43:13.968 --> 43:15.428
Absolutely.

43:15.470 --> 43:18.515
But you will persist.

43:18.556 --> 43:23.353
I remember when I was articling
and pulling 80-hour workweeks--

43:23.395 --> 43:24.813
it was a lot.

43:24.854 --> 43:25.980
Yeah.

43:26.022 --> 43:28.775
But I'm so grateful
I persisted,

43:28.817 --> 43:31.653
because I love the law.

43:31.695 --> 43:33.405
And you...

43:33.446 --> 43:34.906
clearly, love your craft.

43:34.948 --> 43:36.199
Right?

43:36.241 --> 43:38.243
Right. Yeah.

43:38.284 --> 43:39.619
I do.

43:39.661 --> 43:43.665
So maybe the discomfort
is worth it.

43:46.584 --> 43:50.630
Well, you are very wise,
Amelia Kasmerec.

43:50.672 --> 43:52.173
Thank you for noticing.

43:54.634 --> 43:56.344
Are we still on for tonight?

43:58.763 --> 44:00.515
Hey, Mom, how was
the writer's symposium today?

44:00.557 --> 44:02.225
Oh, it was fabuloso!

44:02.267 --> 44:03.309
-[laughing]
-I ran into

44:03.351 --> 44:05.687
a few friends from school,

44:05.729 --> 44:08.023
and your father
was bored to tears.

44:08.064 --> 44:10.233
Ah, I'm much happier
here with you.

44:10.275 --> 44:12.861
Yeah, well, hey,
thanks for coming tonight.

44:12.902 --> 44:15.488
It's gonna be fun,
and it's for a good cause, so.

44:15.530 --> 44:18.742
Oh, side note-- my friend Kylie,
the writer, is gonna be there.

44:18.783 --> 44:20.368
-So...
-Oh, gotcha.

44:20.410 --> 44:23.913
Your father just did some biceps
this morning with it.

44:23.955 --> 44:25.498
[dryly]
It's very heavy material.

44:25.540 --> 44:26.958
[laughing]

44:27.000 --> 44:29.794
Yes, it is! No, really,
uh, you know,

44:29.836 --> 44:33.131
it's a very unique
piece of work.

44:33.173 --> 44:35.550
It's brave of her
to share that with me.

44:35.592 --> 44:36.885
Okay.

44:36.926 --> 44:38.762
-Let's cross here.
-Yes.

44:38.803 --> 44:40.680
You know,
we'd love to take a peek

44:40.722 --> 44:42.057
at some of your work.

44:42.098 --> 44:43.516
Mm-hmm!
Would that be possible?

44:43.558 --> 44:46.353
Uh, s-sure, y-yeah-- oh!

44:46.394 --> 44:47.479
Amelia!

44:47.520 --> 44:49.105
Oh. Hi.

44:49.147 --> 44:50.398
Hi.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.817
Oh, you brought cookies?

44:52.859 --> 44:54.527
Well, I thought
it's a Christmas party.

44:54.569 --> 44:55.737
-It is!
-Yeah.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.238
And you bake, too?

44:58.490 --> 44:59.491
[abruptly]
Okay, let's go in.

44:59.532 --> 45:00.700
-Mm-hmm!
-Come on.

45:00.742 --> 45:04.579
[***]

45:04.621 --> 45:06.414
Raquel McCallan!

45:06.456 --> 45:08.083
It is an honor to meet you.

45:08.124 --> 45:10.752
Thank you so, so much
for agreeing to read my book.

45:10.794 --> 45:12.671
You have no idea
how much it means to me.

45:12.712 --> 45:15.173
Well, thank you,
thank you, Kylie.

45:15.215 --> 45:16.925
Nice to hear it.

45:16.966 --> 45:18.259
I promise not
to pester you for feedback

45:18.301 --> 45:20.136
-while you're here.
-[Raquel chuckles]

45:20.178 --> 45:22.389
Ah, you know what?

45:22.430 --> 45:24.391
I'm glad that there's gonna be
wine at this event.

45:24.432 --> 45:25.475
[laughing]

45:25.517 --> 45:26.518
Ditto.

45:27.936 --> 45:29.437
Did you find
anything to wear yet?

45:30.939 --> 45:33.358
Well, what does "semi-formal"
mean, exactly?

45:33.400 --> 45:34.859
[laughing]

45:34.901 --> 45:36.736
I'll figure it out.

45:36.778 --> 45:39.155
Hey, everyone!
Are you having a good time?

45:39.197 --> 45:41.783
-[crowd cheers and applauds]
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!

45:41.825 --> 45:44.119
Thank you so much
for helping us tonight

45:44.160 --> 45:46.413
as we Light Up the Lab
for our week of festivities.

45:46.454 --> 45:49.749
We would not be here
if it were not for you patrons,

45:49.791 --> 45:51.793
so feel
the spirit of the season,

45:51.835 --> 45:54.671
as Tanner gives us
his beautiful version

45:54.713 --> 45:57.173
of "Angels,
We Have Heard On High."

45:57.215 --> 45:58.174
Yeah, Tanner!

45:58.216 --> 45:59.175
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

45:59.217 --> 46:00.427
[Tanner]
This one's for all of you!

46:00.468 --> 46:02.429
[beat drops]

46:02.470 --> 46:04.806
[plays electronic music]

46:04.848 --> 46:07.308
-Hey! Drop that beat!
-Yes!

46:07.350 --> 46:08.810
[***]

46:08.852 --> 46:10.729
Oh. We're dancing?

46:10.770 --> 46:12.397
Yeah. Put those down!

46:12.439 --> 46:14.482
[***]

46:16.818 --> 46:18.111
Okay, you have moves.

46:18.153 --> 46:20.822
[***]

46:24.784 --> 46:27.537
[***]

46:37.088 --> 46:40.550
[indistinct exchanges]

46:45.513 --> 46:47.349
One second.

46:53.146 --> 46:54.564
Hey.

46:54.606 --> 46:56.649
Why are you working right now?

46:56.691 --> 46:58.651
I've got
a tech rehearsal tomorrow.

46:58.693 --> 46:59.903
We're not ready,

46:59.944 --> 47:01.279
and I haven't even
gotten to the poster yet,

47:01.321 --> 47:03.281
which is due at the printer's
tomorrow morning,

47:03.323 --> 47:05.950
so I need to get this done
right now.

47:05.992 --> 47:06.826
-Okay. Um, I--
-There's no other time.

47:06.868 --> 47:08.661
I can-- I can help you.

47:08.703 --> 47:09.746
-You can?
-Yeah.

47:09.788 --> 47:11.164
Like, now?

47:11.206 --> 47:13.083
Yeah, yeah, um, it'll just
take a minute, right?

47:13.124 --> 47:14.793
[Javier]
Yeah, yeah. Totally. Yeah.

47:14.834 --> 47:16.461
[Dani] Okay. Okay.

47:16.503 --> 47:18.338
[Raquel] She's very busy!

47:18.380 --> 47:21.383
I just wish
we could see more of our girl.

47:21.424 --> 47:23.051
She warned us.

47:23.093 --> 47:24.177
Yeah, she loves being busy.

47:24.219 --> 47:25.303
Yeah.

47:25.345 --> 47:26.888
And she also finds it
hard to say no.

47:26.930 --> 47:29.224
Ah, right.

47:31.309 --> 47:33.687
Please,
don't mind my grumpiness--

47:33.728 --> 47:35.188
I'm just finding retirement

47:35.230 --> 47:37.524
just a little harder
than I thought.

47:37.565 --> 47:38.942
You just need to...

47:38.983 --> 47:40.944
find something--
something to do, right?

47:40.985 --> 47:42.821
-[Luke chuckles]
-He's driving me crazy!

47:42.862 --> 47:44.823
[laughing]

47:44.864 --> 47:46.408
[***]

47:46.449 --> 47:47.617
All right, everybody.

47:47.659 --> 47:48.952
Are you ready
to make some magic?

47:48.993 --> 47:50.912
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah!

47:50.954 --> 47:52.706
Because now is the time--

47:52.747 --> 47:54.916
the lanterns are lit.

47:54.958 --> 47:56.710
Dim the lights.

47:56.751 --> 48:00.255
[***]

48:10.348 --> 48:12.934
[***]

48:17.272 --> 48:18.648
[snap]

48:23.236 --> 48:25.780
So... Amelia?

48:25.822 --> 48:28.825
Tell me. How is it,
working for your father?

48:28.867 --> 48:31.578
'Cause he was a huge workaholic
in college,

48:31.619 --> 48:32.704
and I think

48:32.746 --> 48:34.080
he constructed a tent
in the library

48:34.122 --> 48:35.749
during finals--
remember John?

48:35.790 --> 48:36.958
[laughter]

48:37.000 --> 48:40.086
Um, it can be a bit intense.

48:40.128 --> 48:41.588
[chuckling]

48:41.629 --> 48:42.714
Okay.

48:42.756 --> 48:44.966
Have you always wanted
to be a lawyer?

48:46.217 --> 48:48.261
When I was little,

48:48.303 --> 48:50.055
I used to see Dad
talking to clients

48:50.096 --> 48:51.264
around the kitchen table,

48:51.306 --> 48:53.433
helping people.

48:53.475 --> 48:55.935
That's what
I always wanted to do.

48:55.977 --> 48:57.437
Well...

48:57.479 --> 49:00.815
the first thing
I tell new writers

49:00.857 --> 49:03.443
is to learn how to read
a contract.

49:03.485 --> 49:04.527
Yes!

49:04.569 --> 49:05.779
Yes, yes.

49:05.820 --> 49:08.782
Because, if not,
they will be exploited.

49:08.823 --> 49:10.450
I agree.

49:10.492 --> 49:12.744
You know,
I've often wondered

49:12.786 --> 49:15.288
what it would be like
to represent artists.

49:15.330 --> 49:17.582
I think I'd love it.

49:17.624 --> 49:19.626
Oh, don't spread that around,

49:19.668 --> 49:21.795
or you might find yourself
with a whole new client list.

49:21.836 --> 49:22.962
[Raquel chuckles]

49:23.004 --> 49:24.631
That's not a bad thing.

49:24.673 --> 49:26.883
Hey, um, I just have
a few more things to do,

49:26.925 --> 49:28.510
but I won't be long.

49:28.551 --> 49:30.387
[Luke] Okay, sweetie.

49:30.428 --> 49:32.972
[***]

49:33.014 --> 49:34.474
-[sighing]
-All right.

49:34.516 --> 49:37.352
[deep breath, sighs]

49:39.312 --> 49:42.065
[***]

49:46.069 --> 49:47.987
Did you guys see Amelia leave?

49:48.029 --> 49:49.781
I guess I missed her.

49:49.823 --> 49:52.492
No. She had an appointment
with a new client.

49:52.534 --> 49:53.910
I'm sure
she told you about that.

49:53.952 --> 49:55.161
I-I don't remember.

49:55.203 --> 49:56.621
Well, maybe she didn't
get a chance,

49:56.663 --> 49:58.623
and she didn't want
to bother you--

49:58.665 --> 50:01.042
you seemed very busy
with Javier and, uh--

50:01.084 --> 50:02.043
Dad. I get it.

50:03.169 --> 50:05.338
It's a wonderful quality,

50:05.380 --> 50:06.464
but Amelia

50:06.506 --> 50:10.176
came down here to see you...

50:10.218 --> 50:11.553
and if you want someone special,

50:11.594 --> 50:13.763
you need to treat them
like they're special, right?

50:13.805 --> 50:15.724
I guess
I don't know how to say no.

50:15.765 --> 50:17.434
I just... look.
You guys, go ahead.

50:17.475 --> 50:19.769
I'm gonna stay behind
and help clean up.

50:19.811 --> 50:20.895
-Help...
-Come on.

50:20.937 --> 50:25.233
I think that you are
doing too much.

50:25.275 --> 50:26.568
-You're trying too hard!
-Goodnight.

50:26.609 --> 50:29.696
You know, your friends
are very important, but...

50:29.738 --> 50:31.197
so is Amelia,

50:31.239 --> 50:33.575
and so is your own work!

50:33.616 --> 50:34.701
-Okay, Mama.
-And I think

50:34.743 --> 50:36.870
you need to put attention
on that.

50:36.911 --> 50:39.205
-[Raquel continues, muffled]
-Goodnight.

50:39.247 --> 50:41.541
[continues babbling, indistinct]

50:46.963 --> 50:50.759
[***]

51:12.238 --> 51:14.449
[sighs]

51:18.870 --> 51:21.456
[***]

51:39.432 --> 51:41.601
[***]

51:48.024 --> 51:50.610
[***]

51:54.823 --> 51:55.740
Yes!

52:01.454 --> 52:06.084
[***]

52:06.126 --> 52:07.085
Merry Christmas!

52:07.127 --> 52:10.422
[***]

52:10.463 --> 52:11.840
Good morning!

52:13.591 --> 52:18.555
[***]

52:24.144 --> 52:25.311
Ah...

52:25.353 --> 52:27.063
having a good time?

52:27.105 --> 52:28.648
Mm-hmm! You know...

52:28.690 --> 52:32.193
at first,
I was worried about this, but...

52:32.235 --> 52:33.778
there may be something here.

52:33.820 --> 52:34.988
Yeah?

52:35.030 --> 52:36.781
Enough you keep you busy
for the next while?

52:37.991 --> 52:39.034
Oh, yes, I think so.

52:39.075 --> 52:41.828
Okay, 'cause I-I think
I might, um...

52:41.870 --> 52:44.497
step out and see that friend
that just got back from Oxford.

52:44.539 --> 52:45.832
I can leave this here
and come with you.

52:45.874 --> 52:47.667
No, no, no, no.
You enjoy.

52:47.709 --> 52:49.753
-Okay.
-Mm. [smooch]

52:49.794 --> 52:52.047
I can see you are...
"in the zone".

52:52.088 --> 52:54.883
Mm-hmm. Yes, yes.
She has style, this one!

52:54.924 --> 52:57.677
Very unique,
but not disciplined.

52:57.719 --> 53:00.930
Mm. Well, maybe
that is her strength.

53:01.973 --> 53:03.725
Just saying.

53:03.767 --> 53:05.060
Hmph!

53:05.101 --> 53:07.270
[***]

53:08.980 --> 53:10.690
[snap]

53:10.732 --> 53:13.485
[buzzing chatter and din]

53:13.526 --> 53:15.153
[***]

53:15.195 --> 53:16.696
Excuse me.

53:18.073 --> 53:19.616
You were right.

53:19.657 --> 53:21.534
About what?

53:21.576 --> 53:24.371
You found
something to wear.

53:24.412 --> 53:25.455
[chuckling]

53:25.497 --> 53:27.332
You look stunning.

53:28.917 --> 53:32.087
Right, well,
it's all Kylie and Tanner.

53:33.338 --> 53:35.090
Sometimes, it pays off

53:35.131 --> 53:38.134
to know artists
with such amazing talents.

53:38.176 --> 53:40.053
[chuckles anxiously]

53:40.095 --> 53:42.722
Besides,
I-I need to keep up with you.

53:42.764 --> 53:45.266
You... you're gorgeous.

53:45.308 --> 53:47.852
-[missteps on stair]
-[both] Oh!

53:47.894 --> 53:49.229
I definitely
should've worn my Docs.

53:49.270 --> 53:50.230
[Amelia laughs]

53:50.271 --> 53:51.606
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

53:51.648 --> 53:52.816
This is...

53:52.857 --> 53:53.692
Daniella!

53:53.733 --> 53:55.151
So nice to meet you.

53:55.193 --> 53:57.445
You too. My family
speaks so highly of you.

53:57.487 --> 54:00.281
And this is a fabulous party.

54:00.323 --> 54:01.866
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.

54:01.908 --> 54:03.576
And thank you for coming
with Amelia.

54:03.618 --> 54:05.537
Oh, I'm-I'm just glad we met.

54:05.578 --> 54:07.789
She's wonderful...

54:07.831 --> 54:10.625
just the most unexpected
Christmas miracle.

54:12.002 --> 54:14.212
[background chatter, indistinct]

54:14.254 --> 54:15.672
[words catch]

54:15.714 --> 54:18.133
That food looks amazing.
Will you excuse me a second?

54:20.385 --> 54:22.303
[guests chatter indistinctly]

54:23.638 --> 54:24.973
Well, you look happy.

54:26.057 --> 54:28.018
I am.

54:29.477 --> 54:32.188
I'm sorry I came on so strong
about you being here tonight.

54:32.230 --> 54:35.233
Just... I want you to have
what I had.

54:36.985 --> 54:38.737
Thanks, Dad.

54:38.778 --> 54:41.156
[boisterous laughter carrying]

54:41.197 --> 54:43.658
[laughing]

54:44.909 --> 54:47.787
Did you know that this firm
has a running club?

54:47.829 --> 54:49.122
They want to meet you,

54:49.164 --> 54:50.665
and you need
to tell them the story

54:50.707 --> 54:52.042
of when you ran
the New York City Marathon--

54:52.083 --> 54:53.460
[laughs]
...and you took the wrong turn.

54:53.501 --> 54:54.461
They'll love it!

54:54.502 --> 54:56.004
-Come on.
-So cute.

55:05.930 --> 55:07.349
[indistinct background chatter]

55:07.390 --> 55:09.476
That is one impressive bear.

55:09.517 --> 55:10.769
[chuckling]

55:10.810 --> 55:13.271
I am making bid for him
at Daniella's auction.

55:13.313 --> 55:14.939
I-I feel like we've bonded.

55:14.981 --> 55:16.107
Mm-hmm.

55:17.233 --> 55:19.778
So, when does
your "deal" expire?

55:22.197 --> 55:24.949
-Uh... tomorrow.
-Tomorrow.

55:24.991 --> 55:25.992
Hmm.

55:26.034 --> 55:27.619
Shame.

55:27.660 --> 55:29.454
Both parties seem happy.

55:29.496 --> 55:31.414
You know,
you could renegotiate.

55:33.041 --> 55:34.709
-[phone buzzes]
-Oh. That's my phone.

55:34.751 --> 55:35.585
Excuse me.

55:37.087 --> 55:39.047
Sweetheart, come.

55:39.089 --> 55:40.090
I want you to say hello.

55:40.131 --> 55:41.883
Okay. One second.

55:41.925 --> 55:44.094
Gentlemen, this is
my daughter, Amelia.

55:44.135 --> 55:45.303
[text alert chimes]

55:52.227 --> 55:54.854
I look forward to that.
Thanks.

55:54.896 --> 55:57.232
Hi. Yeah.

55:57.273 --> 55:59.234
I'll take these two.
Thank you.

56:01.778 --> 56:02.987
-Hi.

56:03.029 --> 56:04.781
-Got us drinks.
-Thank you.

56:10.120 --> 56:11.162
Everything okay?

56:11.204 --> 56:12.330
Yeah, yeah.

56:12.372 --> 56:15.583
Um, it was
Javier's play tonight.

56:15.625 --> 56:17.752
What? Y-You missed it?

56:17.794 --> 56:19.754
To be here?

56:19.796 --> 56:21.798
Yeah, this is important to you,

56:21.840 --> 56:24.801
so it's...
important to me.

56:26.136 --> 56:28.096
[chuckling]

56:28.138 --> 56:30.932
Hey, you did not tell me
that you were...

56:30.974 --> 56:32.809
up for partner.

56:33.935 --> 56:37.397
That is the plan, yeah.

56:38.732 --> 56:40.400
You're not excited?

56:40.442 --> 56:42.318
Hmm...

56:45.113 --> 56:46.823
Okay.

56:48.241 --> 56:50.493
Things...
Things change.

56:51.828 --> 56:54.205
Ahem. Okay.

56:54.247 --> 56:55.915
So, last year,

56:55.957 --> 56:58.293
I was... happy.

56:59.252 --> 57:01.504
I had it all.

57:01.546 --> 57:02.589
You know?

57:02.630 --> 57:04.132
Great job? Check.

57:04.174 --> 57:05.884
Relationship? Check.

57:05.925 --> 57:08.428
And...

57:08.470 --> 57:11.431
then everything unraveled.

57:12.974 --> 57:15.143
Margo had

57:15.185 --> 57:17.020
wanted us to travel...

57:17.062 --> 57:19.230
to see things,

57:19.272 --> 57:22.650
experience life
outside of work.

57:24.361 --> 57:27.864
But I'd been
too busy to notice...

57:29.866 --> 57:34.329
...so one day, she came home
and told me she was done.

57:34.371 --> 57:37.123
She didn't want to feel alone
in our relationship anymore.

57:37.165 --> 57:38.917
Which is understandable.

57:40.502 --> 57:44.047
She left right before Christmas

57:44.089 --> 57:46.675
That's brutal.

57:46.716 --> 57:48.343
Yeah, it was.

57:48.385 --> 57:51.221
We also worked at the same firm,
so...

57:52.514 --> 57:54.641
Wow.

57:54.683 --> 57:57.018
The real story
of my fake girlfriend.

57:57.060 --> 57:58.353
[chuckling]

57:58.395 --> 58:00.730
It could be
a Kelly Clarkson song,

58:00.772 --> 58:01.856
I'm not gonna lie.

58:01.898 --> 58:03.608
It could be.

58:05.026 --> 58:07.445
Thanks for sharing.

58:08.446 --> 58:10.448
Well, thanks for listening.

58:12.492 --> 58:15.203
You know, I'd planned

58:15.245 --> 58:18.248
to let Christmas
just slide by this year.

58:18.289 --> 58:19.499
[Dani chuckles]

58:19.541 --> 58:23.503
But... this has been
good for me, actually.

58:23.545 --> 58:27.215
Hanging out with you
and doing all your...

58:27.257 --> 58:29.676
millions of crazy
Christmas events

58:29.718 --> 58:31.928
with your wonderful
artist friends.

58:31.970 --> 58:34.806
It's... It's been great.

58:34.848 --> 58:37.308
It's been a whole new world.

58:37.350 --> 58:39.811
Oh, well...
pfft, same for me.

58:39.853 --> 58:40.979
[chuckling]

58:41.021 --> 58:43.940
But I'm honestly having a blast.

58:45.650 --> 58:46.901
-Cheers.

58:46.943 --> 58:48.319
[clink]

58:49.612 --> 58:52.449
[***]

58:54.659 --> 58:55.910
Yup. Yup.

59:00.248 --> 59:02.959

59:10.258 --> 59:12.635
[***]

59:23.104 --> 59:25.190
[both laughing]

59:25.231 --> 59:26.816
Oh, so cute!

59:26.858 --> 59:28.818
I don't know
how you do this all night.

59:28.860 --> 59:31.029
I can't believe
I wore heels for you.

59:31.071 --> 59:33.073
It really hurts!

59:33.114 --> 59:35.158
Well, you get used to it.

59:35.200 --> 59:37.077
[Dani laughs]

59:37.118 --> 59:39.329
Ah.

59:40.830 --> 59:42.040
Well, Daniella McCallan,

59:42.082 --> 59:44.793
you were
an excellent plus-one.

59:44.834 --> 59:47.796
Ohh! Well, my pleasure,
Amelia Kasmerec.

59:47.837 --> 59:48.963
[laughs]

59:49.005 --> 59:51.132
Seriously, I-I...

59:51.174 --> 59:53.510
I want to thank you

59:53.551 --> 59:56.054
for making
a night I was nervous about

59:56.096 --> 59:58.848
one that I'll remember.

59:58.890 --> 01:00:03.645
Well, that's kinda my forte--
making long-lasting memories.

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:05.605
[laughing]

01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:08.983
Well...

01:00:09.025 --> 01:00:11.611
[***]

01:00:11.653 --> 01:00:13.113
Oh-- um...

01:00:13.154 --> 01:00:15.573
Thank you.

01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:18.576
Well, you can't get rid of me
that easy.

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.665
I, um...

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:25.750
Yeah.

01:00:26.835 --> 01:00:27.877
I...

01:00:29.087 --> 01:00:30.714
I...

01:00:32.257 --> 01:00:33.550
...wanna

01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:36.302
tell you that I'm-I'm...

01:00:36.344 --> 01:00:38.054
looking forward to tomorrow,

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:40.765
to seeing your show.

01:00:40.807 --> 01:00:43.101
Yeah. Me too.

01:00:43.143 --> 01:00:45.020
I'm excited for you to see it.

01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:47.480
Tomorrow.

01:00:47.522 --> 01:00:49.566
Yeah. Tomorrow.

01:00:49.607 --> 01:00:51.735
Right.

01:00:51.776 --> 01:00:52.777
Goodnight.

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:54.404
Goodnight!

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.032
I gotta take these heels off.

01:00:57.073 --> 01:00:58.783
-Yeah, soak your feet!
-[laughs]

01:00:58.825 --> 01:01:00.535

01:01:08.626 --> 01:01:10.086
[water running]

01:01:12.213 --> 01:01:14.591
[***]

01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:31.941
[astonished chuckle]

01:01:31.983 --> 01:01:33.735
It's you.

01:01:35.111 --> 01:01:36.529
[door creaks open]

01:01:36.571 --> 01:01:38.573
I know I said
I would submit photographs,

01:01:38.615 --> 01:01:41.076
but I want to do something more.

01:01:41.117 --> 01:01:42.827
I-I gotta show you this.

01:01:42.869 --> 01:01:43.912
Now?

01:01:43.953 --> 01:01:44.662
Yes!

01:01:44.704 --> 01:01:47.040
Yeah, come on.

01:01:47.082 --> 01:01:48.750
Okay. "Now."

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.210
[notebook thumps table]

01:01:51.503 --> 01:01:53.088
So...

01:01:53.129 --> 01:01:55.674
are we not gonna
talk about last night?

01:01:55.715 --> 01:01:57.342
What about it?

01:01:57.384 --> 01:01:59.219
Amelia--

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.845
wait, what's your middle name?

01:02:00.887 --> 01:02:01.888
Kathryne.

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:03.807
Amelia KathryneKasmerec...

01:02:03.848 --> 01:02:05.350
be honest with yourself.

01:02:05.392 --> 01:02:06.518
You're dating Daniella.

01:02:06.559 --> 01:02:08.603
Fakedating.

01:02:08.645 --> 01:02:10.105
It looked very real
for both of you.

01:02:11.606 --> 01:02:13.274
Don't even know
if she likes me.

01:02:13.316 --> 01:02:15.026
Oh, she likes you.

01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:17.570
You both looked like
I stole all the presents

01:02:17.612 --> 01:02:18.738
under the Christmas tree

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:19.989
when I brought up
the end of the deal.

01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:22.867
Sorry about that,
by the way.

01:02:22.909 --> 01:02:26.162
Come on, just talk to her,
tell her how you feel.

01:02:26.204 --> 01:02:29.958
I don't think I can.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.127
This better not be about Margo.

01:02:32.168 --> 01:02:34.671
It's not. Just...

01:02:34.713 --> 01:02:36.798
real feelings
were never on the table.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.550
Well, now they are.

01:02:38.591 --> 01:02:40.802
Tell her!

01:02:42.345 --> 01:02:43.763
Okay.

01:02:43.805 --> 01:02:47.726
I will...
tell Daniella how I feel.

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.770
Yes. Thank you!

01:02:50.812 --> 01:02:53.815
Yeah, I am not about to see
my favorite "fake" couple

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:56.651
break up before
they even start real-dating.

01:02:56.693 --> 01:02:59.362
[***]

01:03:01.197 --> 01:03:03.867
Uh, let's get that...
on this table.

01:03:04.951 --> 01:03:07.287
Let's get that
by the front door.

01:03:07.328 --> 01:03:09.247
Yes! Food and beverages
straight to the back,

01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:10.331
in the kitchen.

01:03:10.373 --> 01:03:11.833
That on this table.

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.336
Can we get these clipboards
to their matching pieces?

01:03:14.377 --> 01:03:16.379
[***]

01:03:16.421 --> 01:03:18.214
Is this it?

01:03:19.674 --> 01:03:22.218
Look out, Annie Leibovitz.

01:03:23.553 --> 01:03:25.889
[***]

01:03:28.016 --> 01:03:30.101
[Luke]
"Daniella McCallan".

01:03:31.728 --> 01:03:33.897
Our girl has worked so hard.

01:03:35.357 --> 01:03:38.610
[***]

01:03:38.651 --> 01:03:39.861
That's nice.

01:03:48.286 --> 01:03:50.080
-One sec.
-Okay.

01:03:55.418 --> 01:03:56.252
Hi.

01:03:57.712 --> 01:03:58.880
Hi!

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:02.092
So you're gonna
bid on him?

01:04:02.133 --> 01:04:03.218
Mm-hmm.

01:04:03.259 --> 01:04:05.136
I told you--
we have a connection.

01:04:05.178 --> 01:04:06.763
Right.

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.352
I, um...

01:04:12.394 --> 01:04:14.229
I really need to talk to you.

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:16.064
It's important.

01:04:16.106 --> 01:04:18.066
Dani?

01:04:18.108 --> 01:04:20.193
You know what?

01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:21.820
No. It-It can wait.

01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:23.488
-Okay.
-Go. Good luck!

01:04:24.698 --> 01:04:26.908
Hi, and welcome

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:29.077
to the last evening
of our Charity Week Showcase

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:31.246
here at
the Brooklyn Artist Lab!

01:04:31.287 --> 01:04:32.747
[guests cheering]

01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:34.249
Bravo! Bravo!

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:35.417
Whoo!

01:04:35.458 --> 01:04:36.918
I want to thank

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.129
each and every one of you
for coming tonight.

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:41.756
The silent auction is open
until 11 p.m., sharp,

01:04:41.798 --> 01:04:43.883
so, please, be sure
to get your bids in!

01:04:43.925 --> 01:04:45.301
-Got it.
-Yes.

01:04:45.343 --> 01:04:47.887
Now, because this is
our last artist event,

01:04:47.929 --> 01:04:49.723
Daniella McCallan...

01:04:49.764 --> 01:04:51.391
our resident photographer,

01:04:51.433 --> 01:04:53.435
has a question for you.

01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:55.395
[applauding and cheering]

01:04:58.606 --> 01:05:02.444
So...
what makes a good photograph?

01:05:02.485 --> 01:05:04.738
Is it the light?

01:05:04.779 --> 01:05:07.282
Is it the subject?

01:05:07.323 --> 01:05:10.910
Or is it simply the ordinary
turned extraordinary

01:05:10.952 --> 01:05:12.996
because of your memory
of the moment?

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:15.457
Well, I wish I knew.

01:05:15.498 --> 01:05:16.875
[laughter]

01:05:16.916 --> 01:05:18.710
I have been asking myself
that question

01:05:18.752 --> 01:05:20.628
for the last four months,

01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:22.630
and the four months
before that.

01:05:22.672 --> 01:05:23.965
Actually, ever since

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:26.301
my parents gifted me
with my very first camera.

01:05:27.677 --> 01:05:30.513
I knew more at 14
than I do now,

01:05:30.555 --> 01:05:32.349
because I didn't
know any better.

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:35.435
I used to see beauty
through the lens.

01:05:35.477 --> 01:05:38.772
And then, I thought
I had to see smart things,

01:05:38.813 --> 01:05:40.565
and see artthings...

01:05:40.607 --> 01:05:44.361
and then I started to forget
what makes anything beautiful.

01:05:46.196 --> 01:05:47.864
So...

01:05:49.783 --> 01:05:51.743
...I found subjects

01:05:51.785 --> 01:05:53.078
that gave me...

01:05:54.537 --> 01:05:56.081
...unexpected joy.

01:05:56.122 --> 01:05:57.624
[gasps and chuckles]
Wow.

01:06:00.543 --> 01:06:02.337
Because that

01:06:02.379 --> 01:06:04.422
is what makes
a good photograph...

01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:06.216
[chuckling]

01:06:07.717 --> 01:06:10.220
And I have never felt...

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:14.891
...a more joyous holiday season.

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:17.227
Music!

[indistinct exchange]

01:06:52.178 --> 01:06:53.096
Daniella?

01:06:54.139 --> 01:06:56.933
Everyone thinks
that...

01:06:56.975 --> 01:06:58.560
was remarkable.

01:06:58.601 --> 01:07:01.479
Your work was clear
and true

01:07:01.521 --> 01:07:02.772
and focused.

01:07:02.814 --> 01:07:05.108
I'm really proud of you.

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:06.776
I talked to the sponsors

01:07:06.818 --> 01:07:08.069
about the travel grant.

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.612
They were here...

01:07:09.654 --> 01:07:11.823
they very impressed.

01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:13.908
If you're interested...

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:15.994
the travel grant's yours.

01:07:16.036 --> 01:07:18.163
[gasping]
Thank you, Liza.

01:07:18.204 --> 01:07:19.456
Yes! Yes!

01:07:19.497 --> 01:07:20.582
[Liza laughs]

01:07:20.623 --> 01:07:21.875
This is your success--

01:07:21.916 --> 01:07:24.377
you thank you.

01:07:24.419 --> 01:07:25.962
Send me a postcard.

01:07:26.004 --> 01:07:26.838
Thank me later.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.214
[laughing]

01:07:28.256 --> 01:07:30.508
[gasps and squeals]
Congratulations!

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.886
I'm gonna tell everyone.

01:07:32.927 --> 01:07:35.305
[***]

01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.937
Ahem!
* Amelia! *

01:07:44.481 --> 01:07:45.815
Dani's got some news.

01:07:45.857 --> 01:07:47.317
Oh?

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:49.986
Was it about how amazing
her performance was tonight?

01:07:50.028 --> 01:07:51.112
She is so lucky.

01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:52.238
She had someone here
to sponsor her

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.406
to travel the world.

01:07:53.448 --> 01:07:55.116
I think she said something
about Japan.

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:56.743
I am so jealous.

01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:58.536
Um...

01:07:58.578 --> 01:08:00.497
uh, Japan?

01:08:00.538 --> 01:08:02.040
Yeah. She'll tell you
all the details.

01:08:02.082 --> 01:08:03.249
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

01:08:03.291 --> 01:08:05.460
[Kylie giggles]

01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:07.796
I can't wait to tell Tanner!

01:08:07.837 --> 01:08:10.632
[***]

01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:16.721
[exhales nervously]

01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:19.015
So? Uh, what did you
want to talk about?

01:08:20.642 --> 01:08:22.477
Um...

01:08:22.519 --> 01:08:23.978
Yeah.

01:08:26.147 --> 01:08:28.525
Um, here's good.

01:08:34.322 --> 01:08:36.658
"Unexpected joy."

01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:42.706
I wasn't expecting this.

01:08:44.874 --> 01:08:45.917
Me neither.

01:08:47.836 --> 01:08:50.672
And it's December 24th.

01:08:52.173 --> 01:08:53.508
[voice cracks]
And it's over.

01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:58.722
You were
a great fake girlfriend.

01:09:00.348 --> 01:09:03.059
No, we were
great fake girlfriends.

01:09:06.354 --> 01:09:08.398
I hate goodbyes.

01:09:09.983 --> 01:09:14.487
Well, this isn't
a "goodbye" goodbye, is it?

01:09:15.905 --> 01:09:17.741
[sobs softly]

01:09:29.085 --> 01:09:30.837
Goodbye, Dani.

01:09:30.879 --> 01:09:32.881
[***]

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:40.013
There you are!

01:09:40.055 --> 01:09:41.890
I'm sorry.

01:09:44.934 --> 01:09:47.020
What happened?

01:09:47.062 --> 01:09:49.773
[***]

01:09:57.906 --> 01:09:59.282
Dani?

01:09:59.324 --> 01:10:02.410
[Raquel] Hey! Did you
and Amelia have a fight?

01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:05.121
Your girlfriend seems
very upset.

01:10:05.163 --> 01:10:06.706
She's not my girlfriend.

01:10:06.748 --> 01:10:08.458
-No?
-What?

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.378
She's--
She's not my girlfriend.

01:10:11.419 --> 01:10:13.338
I... don't--

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:15.298
She was never my girlfriend.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.134
Well, not--
not my real girlfriend.

01:10:18.176 --> 01:10:19.719
She was--
She was a fake girlfriend,

01:10:19.761 --> 01:10:22.972
and, well, now,
she's not even that, so, um...

01:10:23.014 --> 01:10:24.557
[deep breath, sigh]

01:10:24.599 --> 01:10:27.769
I'm sorry that I wasn't honest.

01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:30.730
I just-- I just wanted
you and Dad to have a good time,

01:10:30.772 --> 01:10:33.900
and I wanted you to know
that I... I was fine,

01:10:33.942 --> 01:10:35.235
and that it was smooth sailing
for me,

01:10:35.276 --> 01:10:37.404
and that I could
captain my ship,

01:10:37.445 --> 01:10:39.406
and make great art,
and have great friends

01:10:39.447 --> 01:10:40.949
and now everything
is just messed up.

01:10:42.117 --> 01:10:44.703
Your ship is sailing fine!

01:10:44.744 --> 01:10:48.415
Liza just told me
you got a grant.

01:10:48.456 --> 01:10:49.624
-Mom, I--
-Dani, please.

01:10:49.666 --> 01:10:51.459
Just-- Just listen.

01:10:52.585 --> 01:10:54.337
-We're not mad.
-No! No, honey.

01:10:54.379 --> 01:10:57.298
And thank you for trying
to look after us, honey.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.968
Yes. We had a great time.

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:03.179
I really enjoyed
editing your friend's book.

01:11:03.221 --> 01:11:07.434
Your father just decided
to take that job in Oxford.

01:11:07.475 --> 01:11:09.269
You knew about that?

01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:11.146
Of course, I knew.

01:11:11.187 --> 01:11:12.814
[Raquel chuckles]

01:11:12.856 --> 01:11:14.482
We love you.

01:11:15.483 --> 01:11:17.444
We want you to be happy.

01:11:17.485 --> 01:11:18.445
[in Spanish]
Que eres feliz, hija.

01:11:18.486 --> 01:11:19.446
[Raquel] Yes.

01:11:19.487 --> 01:11:21.656
[deep breath, sighs]

01:11:21.698 --> 01:11:23.283
Let's go home. Hmm?

01:11:23.324 --> 01:11:24.659
Mm.

01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:26.870
"Three Musketeers."

01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:29.330
[***]

01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:30.874
Come on.

01:11:30.915 --> 01:11:32.417
Is it too late

01:11:32.459 --> 01:11:34.461
for some double peppermint
hot chocolate?

01:11:34.502 --> 01:11:36.296
[Dani]
It's never too late for that.

01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:38.673
[***]

01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:45.472
Morning, Dad.

01:11:45.513 --> 01:11:46.890
[dishes clatter on counter]

01:11:46.931 --> 01:11:48.099
Merry Christmas!

01:11:48.141 --> 01:11:49.601
Merry Christmas.

01:11:49.642 --> 01:11:51.686
Got you a coffee.

01:11:52.896 --> 01:11:53.772
Thanks.

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:56.941
Thanks for being here.

01:11:56.983 --> 01:11:59.527
Well, we are a family.
Where else would I be?

01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:16.628
Okay.

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.547
While I do...

01:12:20.799 --> 01:12:24.010
...want to eventually
follow in your footsteps...

01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:26.221
I'd...

01:12:26.262 --> 01:12:27.681
like to take a step back

01:12:27.722 --> 01:12:30.684
from the corporate lawyer
partner track.

01:12:32.268 --> 01:12:34.229
You don't wanna be a partner?

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:36.356
Well, not right now.

01:12:36.398 --> 01:12:39.067
Because I have a different idea.

01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:42.153
I met so many interesting people
over the last week,

01:12:42.195 --> 01:12:44.155
and they need representation.

01:12:44.197 --> 01:12:46.700
So I'm proposing

01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:49.536
to start
a new division

01:12:49.577 --> 01:12:52.038
with a new type of client...

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.456
artists.

01:12:53.498 --> 01:12:55.333
-Artists?
-Yeah.

01:12:56.418 --> 01:12:57.585
Huh.

01:12:58.712 --> 01:13:00.046
Well, that's--
that's interesting.

01:13:00.088 --> 01:13:02.090
Yeah. So are they.

01:13:03.591 --> 01:13:05.218
I like it.

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.345
[chuckles] Thanks.

01:13:08.763 --> 01:13:10.056
[Luke] So why
did Santa's helper

01:13:10.098 --> 01:13:11.433
need to see a therapist?

01:13:11.474 --> 01:13:12.726
[Tanner] I don't know.

01:13:12.767 --> 01:13:14.477
[Luke] Because
he had low-elf-esteem.

01:13:14.519 --> 01:13:16.354
[groaning and laughter]

01:13:17.605 --> 01:13:20.525
-Hey!
-[trio] Merry Christmas!

01:13:20.567 --> 01:13:22.027
Merry Christmas!

01:13:22.068 --> 01:13:23.278
What's all this?

01:13:23.319 --> 01:13:24.237
It's called Christmas, Dani.

01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:25.739
Get into it.

01:13:26.698 --> 01:13:28.950
How did you sleep?

01:13:31.202 --> 01:13:33.121
Yeah, me neither.

01:13:34.581 --> 01:13:37.834
Um... I owe you an apology.

01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:41.671
Yeah. You were trying
to communicate

01:13:41.713 --> 01:13:43.298
your "boundaries"--

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.758
Boundaries are
a real thing, Mom.

01:13:44.799 --> 01:13:46.760
Yeah. I know.
I know, dear.

01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:50.096
Tanner and I were
talking about them

01:13:50.138 --> 01:13:53.141
for a long, long time
this morning.

01:13:56.186 --> 01:13:59.397
I should have told you
that we were coming.

01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:02.984
We just...

01:14:03.026 --> 01:14:04.027
couldn't bear
the thought

01:14:04.069 --> 01:14:07.155
of not seeing you
at Christmas.

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:10.033
I know, Mom.

01:14:10.075 --> 01:14:11.117
Going forward,

01:14:11.159 --> 01:14:13.620
I promise...

01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:15.538
to listen to my daughter

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:18.416
carefully

01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:20.001
and deeply

01:14:20.043 --> 01:14:23.296
when she's trying
to tell me something...

01:14:24.923 --> 01:14:26.758
...even if I don't like it.

01:14:27.967 --> 01:14:29.302
Thank you.

01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:30.387
Te amo.

01:14:30.428 --> 01:14:33.431
[***]

01:14:35.058 --> 01:14:36.726
Here, Dad.

01:14:36.768 --> 01:14:38.937
Oh. All right.

01:14:38.978 --> 01:14:40.397
[slurps]

01:14:41.523 --> 01:14:43.650
Ugh!

01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:44.567
[smacks lips]

01:14:44.609 --> 01:14:46.653
That is so sweet!

01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:48.488
I can honestly say
I've never had

01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:50.824
a double-peppermint
hot cocoa before.

01:14:50.865 --> 01:14:53.201
They're Daniella's favorites.

01:14:53.243 --> 01:14:54.828
And now mine.

01:14:54.869 --> 01:14:56.538
Hmm.

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:59.082
I wonder
if they have them in Japan.

01:14:59.124 --> 01:15:01.001
Sweetheart...

01:15:01.042 --> 01:15:02.752
she's not even
on a plane yet.

01:15:05.714 --> 01:15:07.841
Amelia won Bedford the Bear!

01:15:07.882 --> 01:15:09.342
Kylie just let me know.

01:15:09.384 --> 01:15:12.053
Oh. That's nice.

01:15:12.095 --> 01:15:14.514
Yeah, I had
a photo for her, too.

01:15:14.556 --> 01:15:16.766
I was gonna give it to her
last night.

01:15:16.808 --> 01:15:19.102
So? Give it to her.

01:15:19.144 --> 01:15:21.146
We said goodbye.

01:15:21.187 --> 01:15:23.565
I don't think
she wants to see me again.

01:15:23.606 --> 01:15:24.649
Dani.

01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:25.900
She ran off crying.

01:15:25.942 --> 01:15:27.527
I don't think
she would do that

01:15:27.569 --> 01:15:28.987
if she really wanted a goodbye.

01:15:29.029 --> 01:15:30.655
Who else did she talk to?

01:15:30.697 --> 01:15:32.824
Just you and Kylie,
I think.

01:15:32.866 --> 01:15:34.701
Kylie was telling everyone
about your good news.

01:15:34.743 --> 01:15:35.869
You know how excited she gets.

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:37.704
And why not?
This grant is amazing.

01:15:37.746 --> 01:15:40.206
You can study anywhere.

01:15:40.248 --> 01:15:43.376
Amelia thinks I'm just
leaving everything behind?

01:15:43.418 --> 01:15:44.836
Mm-hmm.

01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:47.797
It sounds like there
has been a misunderstanding,

01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:51.426
and Amelia is missing
a Christmas present.

01:15:51.468 --> 01:15:53.011
Do you want make a plan?

01:15:55.513 --> 01:15:58.058
Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it.
Yeah?

01:15:58.099 --> 01:15:59.267
Okay.

01:16:03.855 --> 01:16:05.690
[phone rings]

01:16:05.732 --> 01:16:07.984
Oh.

01:16:08.026 --> 01:16:09.486
Yeah?

01:16:09.527 --> 01:16:10.987
Hey, John. It's Luke.
Don't say it's me.

01:16:11.029 --> 01:16:12.655
Act natural.

01:16:14.157 --> 01:16:16.117
Is Amelia with you?

01:16:16.159 --> 01:16:17.369
Where are you?

01:16:18.787 --> 01:16:21.664
And a Merry Christmas
to you, Mr. Wibbles.

01:16:21.706 --> 01:16:23.750
[***]

01:16:23.792 --> 01:16:25.627
He's trying to improvise.

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:27.128
Uh, actually, I'm at
my daughter's place right now,

01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:28.838
and she's going for a run

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.382
in Brooklyn Park.

01:16:30.423 --> 01:16:33.551
She's taking a run
at Brooklyn Park, honey.

01:16:33.593 --> 01:16:34.928
Stall her! Uh?

01:16:34.969 --> 01:16:36.179
15.

01:16:36.221 --> 01:16:38.014
[Luke] 15 minutes.
Okay?

01:16:38.056 --> 01:16:40.934
Uh... that...
shouldn't be a problem.

01:16:42.435 --> 01:16:44.104
[Tanner] You get the tripods,
you get the stands.

01:16:44.145 --> 01:16:44.854
Okay, everyone know
what they're doing?

01:16:49.275 --> 01:16:50.318
[grunts intensely]

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.278
[Kylie cracking up]

01:16:54.906 --> 01:16:56.825
Well, I'm--
oh, oh, sweetheart!

01:16:56.866 --> 01:16:58.743
Uh... hey!

01:16:58.785 --> 01:17:00.328
Uh--

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:02.122
[whispers] Just wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:17:02.163 --> 01:17:03.998
Uh, do you want a snack?

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.709
Maybe a snack to go?

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.002
I could fix you something.

01:17:07.043 --> 01:17:08.420
[laughs] I don't need a snack.

01:17:08.461 --> 01:17:09.295
You sure?

01:17:09.337 --> 01:17:11.297
We-- We just ate.

01:17:11.339 --> 01:17:13.383
-Okay.
-Yeah.

01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:14.467
Okay.

01:17:14.509 --> 01:17:16.011
[chuckles]

01:17:16.052 --> 01:17:17.679
Yeah! So...

01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:19.514
Thanks, John.

01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:22.726
I have no idea exactly
where this plan is going,

01:17:22.767 --> 01:17:24.519
but it's... it's all good.

01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:26.062
Where are we going,
sweetheart? Dani?

01:17:26.104 --> 01:17:27.105
Turn right at the bottom.

01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:28.356
-Okay, fantastic.
-Oh.

01:17:29.357 --> 01:17:31.192
-Yeah.
-Dad?

01:17:31.234 --> 01:17:33.194
[whispers] I'm gonna go.

01:17:33.236 --> 01:17:34.654
Uh...
my daughter's leaving now.

01:17:34.696 --> 01:17:36.740
Can you just hold on?
Hold on for a second?

01:17:36.781 --> 01:17:37.699
So, sweetheart, um...

01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:39.909
just, you know...

01:17:41.244 --> 01:17:42.579
...you wanna make plans?

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.039
For dinner?
Get together, maybe?

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.415
It's Christmas.

01:17:45.457 --> 01:17:46.374
[laughs]

01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:49.336
We... We do have plans.

01:17:49.377 --> 01:17:51.087
Oh! Right.
Right, yes, Of course.

01:17:51.129 --> 01:17:52.088
We talked about that.

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:53.715
-Yeah. Okay.
-Okay.

01:17:54.758 --> 01:17:56.217
Oh! Hi.

01:17:56.259 --> 01:17:57.844
Yeah. She's leaving now.

01:17:57.886 --> 01:17:59.596
Yeah. Right now.

01:17:59.637 --> 01:18:00.638
Uh-huh.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.098
Uh... hun?

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.642
O-kay, yeah, she's gone.

01:18:04.684 --> 01:18:05.477
It's all done?

01:18:05.518 --> 01:18:06.478
Yeah. And she's on her way?

01:18:06.519 --> 01:18:07.771
Yeah, mere moments away.

01:18:07.812 --> 01:18:10.106
Yeah. We'll be waiting
in the apartment!

01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:11.733
No matter what happens.

01:18:11.775 --> 01:18:13.777
As none of us would say,
"It will all work out!"

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:18.281
[***]

01:18:25.955 --> 01:18:27.791
[***]

01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:31.670
[Amelia gasps]

01:18:34.589 --> 01:18:37.175
Bedford?

01:18:37.217 --> 01:18:39.427
No way.

01:18:39.469 --> 01:18:40.553
Aw!

01:18:46.935 --> 01:18:49.396
What is this?

01:18:52.399 --> 01:18:57.320
[***]

01:19:03.952 --> 01:19:06.454
[***]

01:19:06.496 --> 01:19:08.164
[footsteps approaching]

01:19:08.206 --> 01:19:10.959
I took that photo
a long time ago.

01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:14.337
Look, I'm...
I'm indecisive,

01:19:14.379 --> 01:19:16.297
and I talk a lot,

01:19:16.339 --> 01:19:19.509
and when it comes
to people I love...

01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:22.387
I-I don't tell them
when they need to hear it.

01:19:23.596 --> 01:19:25.181
Me too.

01:19:25.223 --> 01:19:26.224
[chuckles]

01:19:26.266 --> 01:19:28.226
I had it all planned out.

01:19:28.268 --> 01:19:31.479
Last night,
I was going to talk to you

01:19:31.521 --> 01:19:33.940
and tell you how I feel.

01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:36.526
When I heard you were leaving,

01:19:36.568 --> 01:19:38.862
I ran.

01:19:40.488 --> 01:19:43.450
So... are you leaving?

01:19:44.868 --> 01:19:46.036
I am...

01:19:47.245 --> 01:19:48.621
But--

01:19:53.168 --> 01:19:54.377
It's you.

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:58.631
If, and when,
I go to Japan...

01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:01.885
...I want to come home to you.

01:20:04.512 --> 01:20:06.890
Congratulations, by the way.

01:20:09.017 --> 01:20:10.518
I don't want to hold you back.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.896
No. No, you never have.

01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:15.774
I mean, if anything,

01:20:15.815 --> 01:20:19.444
I hope that
you'll join sometime.

01:20:20.695 --> 01:20:21.905
[laughs]

01:20:21.946 --> 01:20:23.740
I would love to.

01:20:25.367 --> 01:20:27.035
You know, you and I
were always meant to meet.

01:20:28.286 --> 01:20:29.412
Look.

01:20:29.454 --> 01:20:31.122
This photo?

01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:32.374
I saw you two years ago.

01:20:32.415 --> 01:20:35.669
I took it on my first day
as a New Yorker.

01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:36.836
[chuckles]

01:20:36.878 --> 01:20:38.463
Yeah, on that bench.

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:41.257
I was here...

01:20:41.299 --> 01:20:43.718
I was snapping photos

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.470
and you just came
around the corner and...

01:20:45.512 --> 01:20:47.889
I mean, I didn't know.

01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:51.851
I just recently
developed these rolls

01:20:51.893 --> 01:20:55.689
and imagine my surprise
when I saw your beautiful face,

01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:58.441
right there, on my frame.

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:01.569
It's amazing.

01:21:04.322 --> 01:21:06.700
We could be anywhere
in the world,

01:21:06.741 --> 01:21:10.995
and the universe
would find some way

01:21:11.037 --> 01:21:12.831
to keep us together.

01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:16.418
Okay, so I'm gonna do

01:21:16.459 --> 01:21:18.628
the straight-to-the-point
lawyer thing

01:21:18.670 --> 01:21:19.713
that you taught me.

01:21:20.797 --> 01:21:23.633
Amelia Kasmerec,
can I kiss you?

01:21:25.427 --> 01:21:28.179
[***]

01:21:36.646 --> 01:21:37.939
Yes.

01:21:37.981 --> 01:21:39.232
-[laughing]
-Good!

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.693
Come here.

01:21:41.735 --> 01:21:43.278
* We'll always be together *

01:21:43.319 --> 01:21:45.572
* Wherever we are *

01:21:45.613 --> 01:21:47.866
* Wherever we go *

01:21:47.907 --> 01:21:48.992
Yes.

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:52.162
* We'll always be
angels in the snow *

01:21:52.203 --> 01:21:53.621
* Got fire in our hearts *

01:21:53.663 --> 01:21:55.290
* No matter how cold *

01:21:55.331 --> 01:21:59.336
* We'll always be
angels in the snow... *

01:21:59.377 --> 01:22:01.421
Whoo!

01:22:01.463 --> 01:22:03.173
Can I get the recipe from you?

01:22:05.133 --> 01:22:06.676
* ...Wings of gold *

01:22:06.718 --> 01:22:09.554
* When you're with me... *

01:22:09.596 --> 01:22:11.639
Like, it happens in Brooklyn
a lot, though, I hear.

01:22:11.681 --> 01:22:13.016
[clinking on glass]

01:22:14.517 --> 01:22:16.478
That worked.

01:22:16.519 --> 01:22:18.730
I just-- I wanted
to propose a toast...

01:22:20.982 --> 01:22:24.986
...to friends
who are now chosen family.

01:22:25.028 --> 01:22:26.613
Together, we have created

01:22:26.654 --> 01:22:31.117
one of the most unexpectedly
joyous Christmas ever.

01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:33.036
So...

01:22:34.329 --> 01:22:35.538
...to friends and family.

01:22:36.414 --> 01:22:38.416
-Yes!
-To friends and family.

01:22:38.458 --> 01:22:40.627
[overlapping]
To friends and family!

01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:41.795
* We'll always be together *

01:22:41.836 --> 01:22:43.463
* Wherever we are... *

01:22:43.505 --> 01:22:44.673
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

01:22:44.714 --> 01:22:46.466
* ...Wherever we go *

01:22:46.508 --> 01:22:49.636
* We'll always be
angels in the snow *

01:22:49.678 --> 01:22:52.263
* Got fire in our hearts *

01:22:52.305 --> 01:22:54.057
* No matter how cold *

01:22:54.099 --> 01:22:57.310
* We'll always be
angels in the snow *

01:23:02.732 --> 01:23:05.568
* Angels in the snow *

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:11.157
[***]

01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:13.535
* Angels in the snow *

01:23:13.576 --> 01:23:17.455
* We're flying free
on wings of gold... *

01:23:17.497 --> 01:23:19.165
That'd be cool.

01:23:19.207 --> 01:23:21.501
* Angels in the snow *

01:23:21.543 --> 01:23:23.878
Thank you.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.717
* When you're with me
It feels like home *

01:23:28.758 --> 01:23:30.885
* Angels in the snow *
