00:03.871 --> 00:05.773
[theme music]

00:55.823 --> 00:57.225
- Ah, caramel apples.
- Hey!

00:57.258 --> 00:58.526
Hey!
Leave those alone.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.161
You don't want to end up
fat like your Aunt Jackie.

01:02.863 --> 01:06.234
Halloween's not
for two whole days.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.302
That's torture.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.403
You got something
against torture?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.675
These are for the
trick or treaters.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.943
What trick or treaters?

01:15.976 --> 01:18.045
No one even goes out anymore,
because all the cheapos

01:18.078 --> 01:19.813
in this neighborhood
turn off their lights

01:19.847 --> 01:20.914
and pretend they're not home.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.516
Yeah.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.452
You know what we used to
do to people who did that?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.053
We'd soak their windows.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.155
Cool.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.056
Yeah, and then we'd
hide on the rooftops

01:29.089 --> 01:31.125
and bomb their cars with eggs.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.493
No way.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.763
And then, you get a dog, you
take these brown paper bags,

01:35.796 --> 01:39.400
and you find a scooper--
- More coffee, Officer?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.702
Mom, I got an owie!

01:41.735 --> 01:43.904
So, what do you want
me to do about it?

01:43.937 --> 01:45.206
Come on, Mom.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.178
What are you gonna be
for Halloween, Deege?

01:50.211 --> 01:53.046
Ninja warrior,
master of death.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.483
(IN PAIN) Ow!

01:55.516 --> 01:56.750
Some warrior.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.386
What are you
guys going out as?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.854
Ooh, maybe I'll
be Wonder Woman.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.991
And I'll be Caspar
the friendly ghost.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.559
Good, I guess you
two are just too

02:05.593 --> 02:07.995
mature to go trick or treating.

02:08.028 --> 02:10.398
Besides, if I want candy,
I'll go through your purse.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.836
I'm probably going to
Marcy Michaelson's party.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.639
Roseanne, do you
remember Mrs. Osmond?

02:18.672 --> 02:20.474
Oh, yeah.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.009
She was scary.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.143
Who was she?

02:23.177 --> 02:25.913
Oh, she was this mad
woman over on Elm Ridge

02:25.946 --> 02:27.715
who looked like a vampire.

02:27.748 --> 02:31.519
She had this long, black haggy
hair and some cape thing,

02:31.552 --> 02:33.120
and she used to jump
out from her front porch

02:33.153 --> 02:35.088
and scare us half to death.

02:35.122 --> 02:38.992
Too bad she never
did it on Halloween.

02:39.026 --> 02:43.531
Hey, sis, didn't she you wind
up in jail for the criminally

02:43.564 --> 02:44.665
insane?

02:44.698 --> 02:46.567
Yeah, and I think that--

02:46.600 --> 02:49.803
I read somewhere that
she just got released.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.740
JACKIE: Yeah, I think
I read that too.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.876
Well, you think she'll
come back to Lanford?

02:55.909 --> 02:59.380
If she's truly
insane, she will.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.182
Darlene, they're
just goofing on you.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.718
Yeah, we're just
goofing on you.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.189
Honey, I'm going
over to Oak Orchard

03:09.223 --> 03:10.724
to pick up the plans
for that Gralick job.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.125
You want anything from
the hardware store?

03:12.159 --> 03:13.994
Ah, yeah.

03:14.027 --> 03:18.031
Bring me back a great,
big old, uh, tabletop saw,

03:18.065 --> 03:21.369
you know, and a couple of
[manly noise] power drills,

03:21.402 --> 03:22.202
would ya?

03:25.005 --> 03:25.873
Eh!

03:25.906 --> 03:29.243
You want to be a wise guy, huh?

03:29.277 --> 03:31.245
Well, just for that.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.346
ROSEANNE: (SCREAMING) No!

03:32.380 --> 03:35.483
JACKIE: Don't, Dan,
those are for Halloween!

03:35.516 --> 03:36.417
Halloween!

03:36.450 --> 03:37.651
Ah!

03:37.685 --> 03:39.320
(IN A GHOULISH VOICE)
Did she say Halloween?

03:39.353 --> 03:40.621
[ghoulish laughter]

03:41.989 --> 03:44.024
Dad, do you remember some
psycho named Mrs. Osmond?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.893
Yeah, didn't she have a
couple of hits during the 70s?

03:48.829 --> 03:51.365
Honey, you know the one
they came and took away.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.634
Oh, yeah, she
was a real psycho.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.536
Wasn't she the one that was
always trying to bite her face?

04:01.575 --> 04:05.212
Well, that was when
there was still hope.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.881
But you know what happened
with her after that?

04:07.915 --> 04:08.982
Of course I know
what happened.

04:09.016 --> 04:09.917
Who could forget?
She--

04:12.553 --> 04:13.421
She escaped.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.588
Yeah.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.689
No she didn't.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.391
You said they let her out.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.593
Oh, well, we just
didn't want to scare you.

04:19.627 --> 04:20.528
Yeah, that's right.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.463
You know there's
an APB out on her.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.565
Is that right?

04:24.598 --> 04:28.268
Dan, there's a
woman in our backyard.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.404
She's hiding
behind the garage.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.739
I better go out there, Honey.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.907
No, Dan, no!

04:33.941 --> 04:35.309
Where'd she go?

04:35.343 --> 04:36.344
Where's she go?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.778
[scare noises]

04:37.811 --> 04:39.146
[screams heard]

04:41.148 --> 04:43.617
She ate her face, yeah right.

04:43.651 --> 04:47.287
Aren't you guys a
little old for this junk?

04:47.321 --> 04:49.490
Yeah, but we are
just so good at it.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.758
Yeah, that's right.

04:50.791 --> 04:55.228
When it comes to horror,
your money here is the champ.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.030
Excuse me, did you say champ?

04:57.064 --> 05:00.968
That's right, I am the
fair maiden of fright.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.804
Get back, Loreta.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.840
Jackie, would you set
her straight, puh-lease!

05:06.874 --> 05:09.142
Oooh, I don't know, sis.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.244
I think he might have
got you last year

05:11.278 --> 05:14.415
when he ate his eyeball.

05:14.448 --> 05:17.184
You guys are so weak with
all this Halloween stuff

05:17.217 --> 05:18.085
every year.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.787
(GHOULISH VOICE) Halloween?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.054
Did she say Halloween?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.457
[ghoulish laughter]
I can't stand it.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.892
I'm losing my mind!

05:24.925 --> 05:25.859
Agh!

05:25.893 --> 05:27.327
Egore!

05:27.361 --> 05:29.763
Store!

05:29.797 --> 05:32.099
(GHOULISH VOICE) Fire, bad!

05:32.132 --> 05:34.568
Pain, ass.

05:34.602 --> 05:37.070
All right.

05:37.104 --> 05:41.008
[music playing]

05:59.059 --> 06:01.261
What are you doing?

06:01.294 --> 06:02.095
I got a date.

06:05.699 --> 06:10.303
Mom, that's not a
very good look for you.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.271
It's the perfect look.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.172
Now, scram.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.373
DAN: Rosy!

06:13.407 --> 06:14.875
Get outta here,
get outta here.

06:14.908 --> 06:15.709
Go.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.856
DAN: Honey, you
seen my car keys?

06:28.889 --> 06:29.757
Oh my god!

06:29.790 --> 06:30.758
Oh god!

06:30.791 --> 06:32.159
No, Rosy, no, no!

06:43.170 --> 06:49.242
Thank god, I just
hate burnt toast.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.578
You aren't playing fair.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.612
Is there any coffee?

06:51.645 --> 06:52.546
No.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.882
(SHOUTS) Ah!

06:54.915 --> 06:56.617
Hey, how'd you
know I didn't really

06:56.650 --> 06:57.951
fried by that lousy toaster?

06:57.985 --> 06:59.953
Cuz the lights didn't flicker.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.756
Babe, when you get electrocuted,
you complete a circuit.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.058
And your body sucks up enough
current to create a short

07:05.092 --> 07:06.393
in the rest of the house.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.195
Ah-hah, thank you, Professor.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.497
Good morning.

07:09.530 --> 07:14.201
(GHOULISH VOICE) Ah, a
fresh brain, an unused brain.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.002
Well, he is your son.

07:17.838 --> 07:21.241
Darlene!

07:21.274 --> 07:22.876
They cut out my tongue.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.557
You are so gross.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.291
Gross?

07:38.325 --> 07:42.429
You're disgusting, and I'm
proud to be your momma.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.266
Now, clean up this blood
and finish your breakfast.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.801
What are you doing down there?

07:47.835 --> 07:51.304
The back stroke.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.874
Happy Halloween everybody.

07:53.907 --> 07:54.808
DARLENE: Happy Halloween.

07:54.842 --> 07:55.743
(SCREAMS IN TERROR) Ah!

07:55.776 --> 07:57.945
Very funny, Dan.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.648
I got you something, sounds
from the haunted mansion.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.983
Boy, moans, screams,
and rattling chains.

08:03.016 --> 08:03.884
Oh, I get it.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.619
You taped your date last night.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.954
Yeah.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.622
How'd you guess?

08:08.656 --> 08:09.623
What's this?

08:09.657 --> 08:10.991
The speakers are detachable.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.425
(GHOULISH VOICE) Ah-ha!

08:12.459 --> 08:13.561
So what?

08:13.594 --> 08:15.763
So, you put the
speakers in the windows--

08:15.796 --> 08:19.066
(GHOULISH VOICE) And we can
haunt the entire neighbor.

08:19.099 --> 08:22.936
I'll go get the extension cord.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.372
He's so scary.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.273
How's your costume--

08:26.306 --> 08:27.641
Oh, it's the coolest.

08:27.675 --> 08:28.576
You want to see?
- Yeah.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.409
Walk this way.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.181
Oh.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.415
Yeah.

08:35.448 --> 08:41.254
I am going to be the
Wicked Witch of the Midwest.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.422
Great.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.523
Honey, I need a rag.

08:43.557 --> 08:44.424
I need a rag.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.392
(GASPING) What did you do?

08:45.425 --> 08:46.660
- Oh!
- What's it look like?

08:46.694 --> 08:47.628
I cut myself.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.096
JACKIE: You want
the first aid kit?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.097
Yeah, you better get it.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.299
Oh, that's a lot of blood.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.533
What happened?
- Oh god.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.335
I don't know, I was cutting
something on the jigsaw,

08:55.368 --> 08:56.570
and it-- it was kind of dull.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.305
Oh, let me look at--
you're gonna need stitches.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.740
[screams in shock]

09:06.179 --> 09:08.115
The master.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.584
You half scared me to death.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.053
The master.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.289
That is the sickest
thing I have ever seen--

09:16.323 --> 09:17.490
[screams]

09:18.491 --> 09:21.161
The master.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.031
This is a sick household.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.599
Yeah, and it's
getting a lot sicker

09:25.633 --> 09:28.501
before I'm done with
him, because this time,

09:28.535 --> 09:30.971
it's personal.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.172
[thunder rumbling]

09:32.205 --> 09:33.707
This is so great.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.677
Maybe we'll get thunder and
lightning like in Frankenstein.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.646
Bzz! (GHOULISH
VOICE) It's alive.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.113
It's alive.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.615
[ghoulish laughter]

09:41.649 --> 09:44.517
And I'm married to it.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.452
[phone rings]

09:45.485 --> 09:46.353
BECKY: That's Diane for me!

09:46.386 --> 09:47.287
Hello?

09:47.320 --> 09:48.488
That's Diane for me.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.389
Hello?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.557
Yeah, hi.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.394
Honey, did a guy named
Jeff Gralick call today?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.096
Isn't he the
Oak Orchard's job?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.530
Yeah, he's that
garage conversion.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.532
He wanted to call this
afternoon and speak

09:59.566 --> 10:01.134
to me about some
changes in the plans.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.771
If he could get
through, I might be

10:03.804 --> 10:05.472
able to talk him into
some den work, (SHOUTING)

10:05.505 --> 10:09.076
if some people would
get off the phone!

10:09.109 --> 10:10.043
No.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.344
No, what?

10:11.378 --> 10:12.612
No, he didn't call.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.482
Oh.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.318
[phone dings]

10:18.351 --> 10:25.893
Aw, that is the geekiest
costume I've ever seen.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.961
Where'd you get
the hideous mask?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.362
Drop dead.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.302
Good.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.269
Good?

10:36.303 --> 10:37.738
That was great.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.239
I feel right down.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.108
That was the perfect death.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.911
Darlene, you need to look
a little more bludgeoned.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.779
Yeah, and I need a scar.

10:45.813 --> 10:46.847
Can you do scars?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.616
I mean bloody, drippy,
gooey, ugly scars.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.517
Yeah, I can do scars.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.485
I'll do your makeup too, Becky.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.154
Oh Becky won't
be needing makeup.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.123
She's already grotesque
and hideous as it is.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.795
Why don't you shut your
thin-lipped little mouth?

11:01.829 --> 11:04.464
(SHOUTING) Makeup!

11:04.497 --> 11:06.199
Where are the apples?

11:06.233 --> 11:09.136
Didn't we buy like
100 apples today?

11:09.169 --> 11:13.006
Can't I even get an
apple in my own house?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.875
They're for the
apple-bob later on.

11:14.908 --> 11:18.378
Well, that's just great.

11:18.411 --> 11:22.850
Geez, I thought I was
going to be the Wicked Witch.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.885
Here.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.586
Why aren't you getting
ready for your party?

11:26.619 --> 11:28.355
I'm not going, OK?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.323
I don't even like
Marcy, Michaelson,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.559
or any of her little
snotty friends anyway.

11:32.592 --> 11:33.560
So you didn't get invited?

11:33.593 --> 11:34.694
Who said I wasn't invited?

11:34.728 --> 11:37.297
I'm just guessing.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.932
Well, I'm glad I'm not going.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.133
Just cuz they're
in 10th grade, they

11:40.167 --> 11:42.002
think they're so brilliant.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.771
Well, you know,
older kids are supposed

11:43.804 --> 11:45.005
to rank on younger kids.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.606
That's what high
school is all about.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.108
Hey, look how you
rank on Darlene,

11:48.141 --> 11:49.642
and you're only a freshman.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.344
Hey, we can
always use a couple

11:51.378 --> 11:54.782
more bodies at the
old Haunted Ranchero,

11:54.815 --> 11:56.049
even if they are alive.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.517
Forget about it.
OK?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.485
I'm not interested.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.353
Hey!

12:00.387 --> 12:01.755
Hey!

12:01.789 --> 12:04.224
Hey, just because you
got your evening ruined

12:04.257 --> 12:06.326
doesn't mean you have to
go ahead and ruin mine.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.195
I hate Halloween.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.363
Oh, you don't even
know what Halloween is.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.432
Well, why don't you
not tell me about it?

12:12.465 --> 12:13.533
OK, I won't.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.104
Halloween is the one
night of the entire year

12:17.137 --> 12:20.540
where the veil is lifted
between the living and the dead.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.476
And the dead return from
Hell to walk the Earth.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.578
And we have to dress up
like ghosts and goblins

12:25.612 --> 12:28.515
and stuff to fake out
the evil spirits or else

12:28.548 --> 12:33.386
they might carry us
back to Hell with them.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.055
So why do the dead
people come back?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.557
For the candy.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.659
There's no chocolate in hell.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.161
That's why it's hell.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.595
Well, they have some
chocolate, but it's

12:42.629 --> 12:43.730
really crummy chocolate.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.098
Like, it doesn't have
any caramel or nugget.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.599
It's doesn't have a
creamy center or almonds.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.836
Mother.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.437
Do you want to
go and get dressed,

12:50.470 --> 12:51.872
or do you just want to
go straight to hell?

12:58.912 --> 13:00.814
[scary music playing]

13:13.827 --> 13:16.663
I beheaded the
washing machine.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.198
What'd you do that for?

13:18.231 --> 13:22.702
You'll see my
pretty, you'll see.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.205
OK, think we've got
everything down here.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.106
[coughing]

13:26.139 --> 13:27.540
I lit the jack o' lanterns.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.077
I got the dishes of candy all
laid out in the front room.

13:30.110 --> 13:30.978
You OK?

13:31.011 --> 13:33.847
[coughs] No.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.648
I got the garage cleaned up.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.017
All the games are ready to go.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.585
Got the apple-bob set up.

13:38.618 --> 13:39.486
You sure you OK?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.488
(LOW VOICE) No.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.489
And let's see.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.723
Oh, yeah.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.225
DJ and Darlene made the
cutest little, fake spiders.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.526
[coughs]

13:46.559 --> 13:47.727
I'm so proud of them.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.729
[coughs intensely]

13:49.762 --> 13:50.998
Well, it's getting dark out.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.499
I'd better go. (SHOUTS)
DJ, Darlene, come on!

13:52.532 --> 13:53.500
Let's go!

13:53.533 --> 13:54.401
It's game time!

14:00.941 --> 14:02.375
(SHOUTS) Dan, I hate you!

14:02.409 --> 14:05.345
You're gonna get it!

14:05.378 --> 14:06.779
[door bell] I'm coming.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.920
[door bell] Just a minute.

14:12.953 --> 14:13.820
CRYSTAL: Trick or Treat.

14:13.853 --> 14:14.888
Hold on.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.489
CRYSTAL: Come on,
Lonnie, you gotta yell.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.158
LONNIE: Trick or treat.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.494
Hi, I'm Linda, the
Good Witch of the North.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.267
You think it's too much?

14:27.300 --> 14:30.403
I think it's way too much,
but that's why I like it.

14:30.437 --> 14:34.074
Ooh, and everything
here looks so spooky.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.978
Well, I cleaned up a little.

14:38.011 --> 14:42.149
There's been an accident
with the children.

14:42.182 --> 14:46.553
ROSEANNE: Oh, hey,
you guys looks great.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.321
Hey Lonnie, I
thought you were going

14:48.355 --> 14:50.757
to be Jason for Halloween.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.725
I'm supposed to be a pirate.

14:52.759 --> 14:53.660
Yo, ho, ho.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.531
Well, what do you say
we go out to the driveway

14:58.565 --> 14:59.799
and set fire to some worms?

15:03.170 --> 15:05.105
How do I look?

15:05.138 --> 15:09.809
Oh, oh, looks like
you lost a wing.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.979
Emergency exits are
that way and that way.

Eccentra, your tour guide

15:36.236 --> 15:39.472
through the Tunnel of Terror.

15:39.506 --> 15:43.543
This is the master's laboratory
where he does his research.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.912
Ah, there's the master now.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.048
Or is that just one
of his experiments?

15:51.851 --> 15:53.086
(GHOULISH VOICE)
Go an aspirin?

15:53.120 --> 15:55.488
I got a splitting headache.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.856
(GHOULISH LAUGHTER)

15:58.391 --> 16:01.394
I wouldn't go too near
the chef if I was you.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.829
You might end up
being the main course.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.165
[scary scream]

16:09.102 --> 16:13.273
Would you like to try some of
our delicious intestinal stew?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.741
(SCREAMING) Don't!

16:14.774 --> 16:15.708

16:23.616 --> 16:25.052
That way.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.020
(IN AN ENCHANTED VOICE)
This is the only way out.

16:27.054 --> 16:30.457
Follow me to the
enchanted garage.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.924
Hey.

16:31.958 --> 16:32.892
Hey Sis.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.394
Hey Jackie.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.330
Hey, um, can you help
me think of something

16:37.364 --> 16:40.633
to really scare Dan, because I
don't want nothing just either.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.369
I want something, like,
to really scare him.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.203
Tell him you're pregnant.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.241
I don't wanna kill him.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.642
[door bell]

16:49.676 --> 16:51.311
Another customer.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.312
Think of something, OK?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.114
- Yeah.

Oh, Josh, hey, how you doing?

17:21.408 --> 17:22.975
Honey, this is Jeff Gralick.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.611
This is the job tomorrow.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.812
I just got in.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.815
I thought, maybe, you'd
like to go over the plans.

17:28.848 --> 17:32.385
Is-- Is this a bad time?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.621
I mean, you've got an
axe in your forehead.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.956
Oh, no, no, I got the
plans in the bedroom.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.826

Nice to meet you, Jeff.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.530
Wow.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.699
This is really great.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.135
You go for this sort of thing?

17:48.168 --> 17:49.602
Oh yeah, I love it.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.139
I used to do the Halloween
show every year for the JCs.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.974
Hey, you wanna help
me scare my husband?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.409
I'd really like to get him.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.644
What kind of sport are you?

17:57.677 --> 17:58.478
You lead.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.950
Jeff, did they feed you
anything on that plane?

18:03.983 --> 18:05.918
No, and I'm really hungry.

18:05.952 --> 18:06.819
Oh, are you?

of our dead man stew?

18:15.828 --> 18:17.264

18:17.297 --> 18:18.265
What are you doing?

18:18.298 --> 18:20.267
This is a $50 tie!

18:20.300 --> 18:22.269
Well, here, let me
just rinse it off for ya.

think you're doing?

18:39.051 --> 18:41.654
Look, maybe I should just
get myself another contractor

18:41.688 --> 18:43.390
or just get the hell
out of this place.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.657
Oh, come on, Jeff.
Wait a minute.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.592
Wait a minute, will ya?

18:45.625 --> 18:46.659
What difference
does it make, Dan?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.761
You said he was a
big jerk, and he is!

the hell she's doing.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.168
I don't know what she's doing.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.369

19:55.295 --> 19:57.764
OK, if that's you, cut it out.

19:57.797 --> 19:58.698
Cut it out.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.639
OK, Dan, this isn't funny.

20:06.673 --> 20:11.478
I'm serious, you're scaring me.

Cut it out.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.390
I'm sorry about
that thing with Jeff.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.791
He knew it was a joke.

20:27.860 --> 20:28.828
Come on, Dan, OK.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.798

20:51.451 --> 20:54.854
No, no, I know he
needs time off.

20:54.887 --> 20:58.991
Oh yeah, well, I'm sure Dan
and the kids would love it.

out in a couple of days, huh?

OK? (IN A HUSH TONE)

21:05.398 --> 21:06.265
What am I going to do?

21:06.299 --> 21:09.536

OK, yeah, it's fine.

You're gonna be here for
two we-- oh, three weeks.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.945
OK, that's fine, Mom.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.680
Well, we look forward
to seeing you.

21:20.713 --> 21:25.151
We love you, too, and I'll see
you in a couple of days then.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.052
Bye.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.954
No, no.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.255
You call her back right now.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.190
You call that woman, and you
say there's no way in hell

21:31.223 --> 21:33.993
that they're staying here
for three weeks, or you--

21:34.026 --> 21:35.127
The master.
