WEBVTT

00:08.880 --> 00:10.160
The club was in administration.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.440
...if we were going to have a club
and to play football.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.920
There was a point where I was
actually thinking, "Who would I follow?"

00:15.000 --> 00:17.160
<i>This business is at the heart</i>
<i>of our community.</i>

00:17.240 --> 00:19.960
<i>It felt like that was</i>
<i>going to be the end.</i>

00:20.040 --> 00:21.760
I won't let this club go under.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.520
<i>Ambrose! Goal!</i>

00:28.400 --> 00:29.880
The rebirth of this football club.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.680
<i>Survived by the skin of their teeth!</i>

00:32.760 --> 00:34.920
<i>The club would be liquidated</i>
<i>if we didn't do it.</i>

00:35.000 --> 00:37.760
He got in his car and he was in my office
in about half an hour.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.840
There were 3000 fans outside
Lloyds Bank in London.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.160
<i>So we ended up owning a football club.</i>

00:43.240 --> 00:45.360
<i>There was something there, local talent.</i>

00:45.440 --> 00:47.720
<i>He was just a kid</i>
<i>that wanted to play football.</i>

00:47.800 --> 00:49.480
<i>This club is definitely a family.</i>

00:49.560 --> 00:51.040
There's genuine love here.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.720
You're taking training Monday morning.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.600
<i>Having fans as owners</i>

00:54.680 --> 00:56.920
and then also Dougie
taking over as manager...

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
It felt special.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.520
<i>Our manager was so much</i>
<i>part of the fabric of this club.</i>

01:00.600 --> 01:01.920
<i>Everybody doubted us.</i>

01:02.000 --> 01:03.920
<i>We were second favourites for relegation.</i>

01:04.000 --> 01:05.200
<i>Anything's possible.</i>

01:15.040 --> 01:17.160
Can you remember the start of the season,
losing the first few games?

01:17.240 --> 01:19.520
-Yeah.
-What was missing from the team then?

01:19.600 --> 01:21.320
I have no idea, really.

01:21.520 --> 01:24.440
Losing every week and I was
like, "This is a disaster."

01:24.520 --> 01:26.360
If memory serves me right,
we were odds on to go

01:26.440 --> 01:28.440
down as well, before a ball
had even been kicked.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.280
I think there was some, you know,
murmurings about Dougie's position.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.680
You're under no illusions that,
especially on the back

01:33.760 --> 01:36.960
of the previous season,
there's always that added pressure.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.600
It never filtered down to us
as a group,

01:39.680 --> 01:41.400
for whatever reason, you know,

01:41.480 --> 01:43.360
you got to commend Dougie on that.
You commend everyone else,

01:43.440 --> 01:46.360
they kept it to themselves
and they kept it that way for a reason.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.960
We knew it was start of the season,

01:48.040 --> 01:50.200
we knew that there was a lot of time
to turn it all around,

01:50.280 --> 01:53.400
and we hadn't changed our opinion
of being able to turn that around.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.520
I know I didn't.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.800
Next day, I had a meeting with Dougie.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.160
It was quite difficult.
We had different points of view.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.480
Within that meeting,
Steve's views on the team...

02:03.560 --> 02:05.080
and my views on where we want to be...

02:05.160 --> 02:07.080
But in the end I said to Dougie,
"Look, what do you need?"

02:07.160 --> 02:09.560
<i>A very creative midfield player</i>
<i>and a wide man.</i>

02:09.640 --> 02:12.560
I mean, it costs around
Â£500,000 and I said,

02:12.640 --> 02:16.200
"Fine, let's do it.
I think you haven't got enough."

02:16.280 --> 02:18.960
In the end, you know,
we walked out of the Soho meeting,

02:19.040 --> 02:22.840
fantastic four or five players
in Gabbidon and Delaney

02:22.920 --> 02:25.280
<i>and Bolasie and Andre Mortiz,</i>

02:25.360 --> 02:28.040
which resulted then
in them challenging the group

02:28.120 --> 02:29.160
that we'd already had.

02:29.240 --> 02:32.520
I was told by a very,
very top manager that,

02:32.600 --> 02:34.880
"Go and sign winners."
And that's exactly what we did.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.480
We went and signed winners.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.760
<i>Damien Delaney,</i>

02:37.840 --> 02:41.480
<i>challenged myself and my staff</i>
<i>a few weeks later on,</i>

02:41.560 --> 02:43.600
<i>that they would like to get promotion.</i>

02:43.680 --> 02:45.720
<i>And when I heard them words ringing</i>

02:45.800 --> 02:48.160
and everybody staring at me,
and I certainly knew that

02:48.240 --> 02:50.080
we had a promotion, challenging team.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.680
<i>They are back from the brink!</i>

03:00.040 --> 03:01.960
<i>The club that they've loved</i>
<i>since children.</i>

03:02.520 --> 03:04.320
<i>Wilfried Zaha!</i>

03:05.520 --> 03:08.480
<i>That is magical, simply magical!</i>

03:08.560 --> 03:10.080
<i>Top of the championship!</i>

03:10.160 --> 03:12.520
<i>I cannot believe</i>
<i>what Crystal Palace have done.</i>

03:12.600 --> 03:14.320
<i>Back from the brink of oblivion.</i>

03:14.400 --> 03:17.160
<i>In the biggest match,</i>
<i>on the biggest stage!</i>

03:17.240 --> 03:20.600
<i>That will always be etched</i>
<i>in Crystal Palace history.</i>

03:37.520 --> 03:41.720
<i>Coming to Palace was like</i>
<i>a changing life moment for myself,</i>

03:41.800 --> 03:45.080
<i>as well as Dougie or Steve,</i>
<i>or whoever's saying,</i>

03:45.160 --> 03:46.680
<i>you know, that I was a changing thing.</i>

03:46.760 --> 03:49.600
Now that was a changing moment
for my life as a man,

03:49.680 --> 03:52.120
and as a player,
as a father today, who I am.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.040
And yeah, I'm grateful for that.

04:07.480 --> 04:11.040
<i>And I used to just like Henry,</i>
<i>the Ronaldos and the Ronaldinhos,</i>

04:11.120 --> 04:12.840
<i>the way they play their game, man.</i>

04:12.920 --> 04:16.120
And I used to like how the fans
take to those type of players.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.080
So that was the reason
why I really wanted to play football.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.920
You know, the way the fans
buzzed off the players,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.400
"Wow. This kind of player."
And even till now,

04:24.480 --> 04:26.920
I'm still kind of,
of the same kind of mind-set.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.960
<i>I moved from Plymouth to Bristol City.</i>

04:30.040 --> 04:34.240
I was like in and out of the team,
I was turning 22 at that age, you know,

04:34.320 --> 04:36.640
I was, "I just want to play games.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.600
I don't care about anything else.
I just want to play."

04:39.680 --> 04:41.440
<i>I played against Palace</i>
<i>the season before,</i>

04:41.520 --> 04:44.040
and I kind of knew
Wilf already does his thing.

04:44.120 --> 04:47.080
If I can come in and do
my thing like that as well,

04:47.160 --> 04:48.240
it'd be a great thing.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.240
<i>I had seen Bolasie at Barnet</i>
<i>for the very first time,</i>

04:51.320 --> 04:52.680
<i>and he was a very lost soul</i>

04:52.760 --> 04:55.320
who was unfit and no real understanding
of the game,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.120
but had the tremendous desire

04:57.200 --> 04:59.960
to get on the ball and show his skills.

05:00.040 --> 05:03.200
<i>Then I knew that with Wilfried Zaha</i>
<i>coming through,</i>

05:03.280 --> 05:04.920
there was two men on him the whole time,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.200
so I knew I had to have
an outlet on the other wing.

05:07.280 --> 05:08.800
<i>When we put Bolasie there,</i>

05:08.880 --> 05:11.400
<i>all of a sudden there was</i>
<i>another dimension to the team.</i>

05:11.480 --> 05:12.920
<i>I always kept an eye on Bolasie,</i>

05:13.000 --> 05:17.600
and it was quite easy to get Yannick here,
because Bristol just beat us 3 or 4-0.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.640
And I went into the office
of the manager, Derek McInnes,

05:20.720 --> 05:23.000
he was sitting back
in his chair at the time,

05:23.080 --> 05:25.160
swinging back
and very pleased with himself.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.480
It was a very easy deal to do,

05:27.560 --> 05:29.600
because he was feeling sorry for myself.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.960
I said to my agent,
I don't care about finances.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.640
Get me to sign there.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.760
<i>I'll prove myself then.</i>

05:37.840 --> 05:40.240
<i>And a few days later</i>
<i>we got that deal done.</i>

05:42.040 --> 05:43.960
Yeah, the first training session,
it was like,

05:44.040 --> 05:45.800
straight away started clicking, you know?

05:45.880 --> 05:48.640
Because they started seeing
what kind of ability I possess

05:48.720 --> 05:51.840
and that's when I just
naturally clicked with Wilf.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.800
Finally, someone that wants
to compete with me

05:54.880 --> 05:57.560
on a skill aspect.
So it was exciting for me, man.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.520
People think,
because we kind of do the same things,

05:59.600 --> 06:01.720
we're similar.
No, we're a bit different.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.520
<i>He's more of a powerhouse.</i>

06:03.600 --> 06:07.440
<i>If his tricks don't work,</i>
<i>he will just get you out the way.</i>

06:07.520 --> 06:10.360
<i>I think I'm more technical,</i>
<i>but Yannick's way more strong</i>

06:10.440 --> 06:12.760
<i>and, like, power through people.</i>

06:12.840 --> 06:15.880
He's one of my best friends
in football up till now.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.800
And I don't really speak
to much footballers.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.400
He's like literally my best friend
in football.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.560
I also clicked with him
on and off the pitch.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.320
And you know, it made me feel comfortable,

06:24.400 --> 06:27.880
along with, like, Mile and Damo,
and everyone else.

06:27.960 --> 06:32.000
<i>You can see the team spirit,</i>
<i>you know, the spine of the team,</i>

06:32.080 --> 06:37.120
and the team spirit on and off the field
was there. Definitely.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.280
I remember coming to training
and walking out on the training pitch.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.040
I remember seeing this guy,
a few step overs

06:43.120 --> 06:45.360
and crossing, I'm like,
"Who's this? Who have we signed now?"

06:45.440 --> 06:47.800
I remember his first day, actually.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.640
You had no idea what he was
going to do, to be honest.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.760
You give him the ball
and then you just,

06:52.840 --> 06:55.000
<i>no one knows,</i>
<i>that's what made him great.</i>

06:55.080 --> 06:57.640
<i>No defender knew what he was</i>
<i>gonna do either, he's so unpredictable.</i>

06:57.720 --> 06:59.280
<i>Some signing, to be honest.</i>

06:59.360 --> 07:00.880
Yeah, he probably nutmegged us

07:00.960 --> 07:02.680
and done one of his ridiculous tricks.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.080
<i>You had these two young kids,</i>

07:04.160 --> 07:06.440
<i>who just came in with</i>
<i>the biggest smiles on their faces,</i>

07:06.520 --> 07:08.600
<i>doing all these tricks</i>
<i>and flicks that, inevitably,</i>

07:08.680 --> 07:10.920
<i>ended in us wanting to try to kick him</i>
<i>or two foot him or something.</i>

07:11.000 --> 07:13.320
They were just the balance
that the group needed.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.960
They kept the light heartedness,

07:15.040 --> 07:18.760
and, you know, Wilf was coming
in late and kissing his teeth

07:18.840 --> 07:22.080
because he was getting
rollicking off Mile or Paddy,

07:22.160 --> 07:23.600
or it's Wilf and...

07:23.680 --> 07:25.640
You knew that
when he goes out in the pitch,

07:25.720 --> 07:27.640
he was gonna do something,
and Yala was the same.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.480
A bit daunting coming into,
you know, a group of lads

07:30.560 --> 07:33.160
who've kind of been with each other
for a year or so anyway,

07:33.240 --> 07:34.680
<i>but it was a good group.</i>

07:34.760 --> 07:36.360
<i>Don't know if he trained that day or not,</i>

07:36.440 --> 07:38.480
but he did play
in the game the next day.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.320
<i>For a kid like that to just come in</i>
<i>and play his natural game,</i>

07:41.400 --> 07:42.520
<i>it was great to see that.</i>

07:42.600 --> 07:45.280
Yala was just somebody
who I just loved watch playing.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.680
<i>And he was perfecting his skills.</i>

07:46.760 --> 07:49.200
<i>Heading and kicking was mine,</i>
<i>his was the tricks and flicks.</i>

07:49.280 --> 07:51.000
<i>And he was just a joy to be around.</i>

07:51.080 --> 07:52.960
<i>At the time, he was pretty raw.</i>

07:53.040 --> 07:54.800
The thing I most remember
about Yannick is,

07:54.880 --> 07:56.640
he was just skinny
and much, much skinnier,

07:56.720 --> 07:59.600
and he worked on his physicality
to become an absolute animal.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.080
Obviously you can just see
what he's turned into now.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.240
<i>Remember thinking to myself,</i>

08:04.320 --> 08:06.200
<i>he's got the right ingredients here.</i>

08:06.280 --> 08:07.840
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>what he's gonna give you sometimes,</i>

08:07.920 --> 08:09.280
<i>but we'll manage that.</i>

08:09.360 --> 08:11.480
<i>By having Bolasie on one wing</i>
<i>and Zaha,</i>

08:11.560 --> 08:14.720
that moved us forward,
from being a very defensive team

08:14.800 --> 08:16.920
to now probing teams in the attack.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.720
I wouldn't want to be
on their opposite side, you know

08:18.800 --> 08:20.560
'cause who am I going to pick?

08:20.640 --> 08:22.960
You need to really be on your toes,
because they are so quick

08:23.040 --> 08:24.840
<i>and they're so unpredictable,</i>
<i>what they do,</i>

08:24.920 --> 08:26.760
which, you know, creates problems.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.040
When he came, it definitely
made an instant impact.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.400
<i>And then we went away to Middlesbrough,</i>
<i>which was exceptional.</i>

08:36.480 --> 08:40.440
<i>We were a completely different team</i>
<i>with another player playing out wide,</i>

08:40.520 --> 08:42.880
<i>they couldn't just mark Wilfried</i>
<i>out of the game.</i>

08:42.960 --> 08:45.080
That obviously opened up
a little bit more of the pitch

08:45.160 --> 08:48.000
in the middle of the park,
and we can control the ball

08:48.120 --> 08:49.320
a little bit more, you know.

08:49.400 --> 08:53.720
So that was the dimensions
that I was looking for.

08:53.800 --> 08:57.400
And we started to find a way
that would suit us as a team.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.200
<i>And although we lost 2-1,</i>

08:59.280 --> 09:01.880
<i>I remember Steve Gibson saying</i>
<i>to me afterwards, "Wow, you know...</i>

09:01.960 --> 09:03.840
<i>...you're a good team.</i>

09:03.920 --> 09:05.760
We really expected
we were gonna roll you over today.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.840
But you're much better
than we thought you were."

09:07.920 --> 09:09.720
We were still, I think,
bottom of the league,

09:09.880 --> 09:12.080
<i>but it felt like we're going to be okay.</i>

09:12.480 --> 09:14.080
<i>The next game,</i>
<i>Sheffield Wednesday,</i>

09:14.160 --> 09:16.280
<i>and they hadn't lost for seven months.</i>

09:16.360 --> 09:18.680
<i>Pressure on Dougie Freedman,</i>
<i>Crystal Palace coming to this one</i>

09:18.760 --> 09:20.320
<i>having lost their last three.</i>

09:20.400 --> 09:22.840
<i>Testing times, these, in South London.</i>

09:26.800 --> 09:28.480
<i>It is Yannick Bolasie.</i>

09:30.040 --> 09:32.640
<i>He goes one way,</i>
<i>then the other, and gets a cross in,</i>

09:32.720 --> 09:34.800
<i>and finds Glenn Murray who scores!</i>

09:34.880 --> 09:36.160
<i>We've only played a minute!</i>

09:36.240 --> 09:38.480
<i>What a great start</i>
<i>this is for the Eagles.</i>

09:40.280 --> 09:45.080
<i>Glenn Murray! Glenn Murray!</i>

09:47.080 --> 09:49.360
<i>Here's the corner, which eludes everyone</i>

09:49.440 --> 09:52.520
<i>except Michail Antonio at the far post!</i>

09:52.600 --> 09:54.720
<i>And he equalizes, it's 1-1.</i>

09:55.800 --> 10:00.120
<i>Zaha, tormenting that Sheffield Wednesday</i>
<i>defence once again.</i>

10:00.200 --> 10:02.360
<i>He gets another cross in</i>
<i>and finds Murray</i>

10:02.440 --> 10:03.840
<i>who strikes again!</i>

10:04.280 --> 10:07.280
<i>Palace back in front! It's 2-1!</i>

10:23.960 --> 10:27.040
<i>It went from bad atmospheres</i>
<i>in football clubs,</i>

10:27.120 --> 10:29.560
<i>bad feelings, and losing,</i>
<i>to all of a sudden,</i>

10:29.640 --> 10:31.720
<i>just being in a changing room,</i>
<i>where there was a good feeling.</i>

10:31.800 --> 10:33.720
And then won a game of football.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.000
<i>They just took me over on trial</i>
<i>and they signed me straight away,</i>

10:37.080 --> 10:38.720
Playing reserve-team football.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.640
And then Peter Taylor got the job at Hull

10:40.720 --> 10:42.600
about a year later
and he phoned me and said,

10:42.680 --> 10:44.000
<i>"Look, do you want to come to Hull?"</i>

10:44.080 --> 10:46.600
<i>When I left Hull, they ended up</i>
<i>getting promoted that season.</i>

10:46.680 --> 10:49.040
<i>And I was thinking</i>
<i>maybe that was my chance gone,</i>

10:49.120 --> 10:52.840
<i>chance to move from Hull to West London</i>
<i>was kind of too good to turn down.</i>

10:52.920 --> 10:55.280
But I soon realized after going into QPR

10:55.360 --> 10:57.640
what an absolute shit show that was.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.520
Some managers weren't even... lasting
a matter of weeks and they were fired.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.360
Then I left QPR and went to Ipswich,
and QPR got promoted.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.760
So it's like I almost missed out
on two promotions.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.520
And that's kind of how I felt
at the time, a tough experience.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.840
<i>And I couldn't wait to get out.</i>

11:09.920 --> 11:12.760
<i>I kind of had maybe four,</i>
<i>five years of battling, really.</i>

11:12.840 --> 11:15.640
<i>I was gonna go to America</i>
<i>but it was September</i>

11:15.720 --> 11:17.840
and the American League
won't start until January.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.200
<i>As I was packing my stuff</i>
<i>to move home to Cork,</i>

11:20.280 --> 11:23.120
I got a phone call from Dougie.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.680
Dougie said,
"Look, I've got no centre-halves."

11:24.760 --> 11:27.560
Because Paddy just got injured.
I wasn't really interested.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.360
<i>I was finished,</i>
<i>and I was gonna go to America</i>

11:29.440 --> 11:31.160
<i>and I didn't wanted to play football</i>
<i>in England anymore.</i>

11:31.240 --> 11:32.720
<i>And then I remember</i>
<i>I had a conversation with Dad,</i>

11:32.800 --> 11:34.720
and he said, "What are you gonna do
between now and January?"

11:34.800 --> 11:36.360
"Gonna go home." And he went,

11:36.440 --> 11:38.920
"Well you might as well just do
three months in the UK.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.840
And that's all Dougie was offering me.
It was a three-month deal.

11:41.920 --> 11:45.480
<i>And I was just about to set off</i>
<i>from Ipswich to Stansted and fly home.</i>

11:45.560 --> 11:48.160
And instead, I kind of
got in my car and drove down.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.960
<i>So I went and met Dougie</i>
<i>and I still wasn't sure.</i>

11:51.040 --> 11:54.040
It was just funny. As soon as I walked
in the changing room, I just seemed to...

11:54.120 --> 11:56.040
I don't know, I just got a good vibe
from it really.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.200
<i>Owen Garvan was there, Paddy was there,</i>

11:58.280 --> 12:00.560
Aaron Wilbraham, Peter Ramage,
all lads that I'd played with

12:00.640 --> 12:02.080
that I knew were good people.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.080
We had obviously kept in touch
and he just rang

12:04.160 --> 12:06.280
and he said he was coming down.
By this time

12:06.360 --> 12:08.520
I think Paddy had gone under the knife
and was gonna

12:08.600 --> 12:10.080
be missing for the majority of the season.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.120
I think there was only really me
and Aaron Martin.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.920
I was really obviously

12:14.000 --> 12:16.760
buzzing for Damo to come in as a mate,
more than anything else.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.160
But knowing that
he was the kind of character

12:18.240 --> 12:19.960
that was needed
for the dressing room as well.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.480
He fitted it into the ethos.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.920
And it was just a good kind of mix.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.800
And Dougie kind of just said to me,
"Look, you've signed for three months.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.640
And if you sign today, you play
tomorrow against Sheffield Wednesday

12:30.720 --> 12:33.240
And Dougie, I could tell
he was absolutely, like, desperate

12:33.320 --> 12:35.880
for anyone to come in
because he didn't have any players.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.880
And I just kind of went, "You know what,
I'll go down and I'll see what happens."

12:38.960 --> 12:41.920
Have a month off of December
and then go to America in January.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.520
And that was really
my, kind of, train of thought.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.720
So I signed that day.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.640
<i>Played Sheffield Wednesday</i>
<i>the following day, then Muzza got two.</i>

12:50.720 --> 12:52.960
Damo walks through the door,
big Irish smile.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.400
Well, there was that
instant respect from everybody.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.800
And he just kind of added
to the leadership group that,

12:58.880 --> 13:00.160
you know, Dougie had brought together.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.640
There was such a good vibe.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.840
And all of a sudden,
all the good feelings came back.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.440
I mean, ultimately,
that's why everyone plays football

13:06.520 --> 13:11.440
it's to win games, and winning a game
on a Saturday is the best feeling

13:11.520 --> 13:15.720
you could ever get, and that one win
brought the love back, I suppose.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.480
<i>And even the love</i>
<i>that I'd lost for football</i>

13:17.560 --> 13:19.880
or the real passion or desire
that I had

13:19.960 --> 13:21.560
was kind of beaten out of me.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.280
<i>That Sheffield Wednesday game,</i>
<i>come back into the changing room</i>

13:23.360 --> 13:26.160
and afterwards everyone was so happy,
I'd bought into that as well,

13:26.240 --> 13:29.200
even though I was only in the club
or in the building 24 hours,

13:29.280 --> 13:30.600
I bought into that, because I thought,

13:30.680 --> 13:32.440
"Well, I haven't won a game myself either
in a long time."

13:32.520 --> 13:34.240
Because I think Palace were the same,
you know,

13:34.320 --> 13:36.880
there was administration
and there was troubles, problems.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.280
Wasn't a great start to the season,

13:38.360 --> 13:41.600
they weren't winning games either,
I wasn't having a particularly good time

13:41.680 --> 13:44.480
and all of a sudden, one win,
just flipped everything on its head.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.720
In the changing room after that game,
it was like we'd won Champions League.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.000
It was like,
"Yes, we won a game of football!"

13:54.200 --> 13:56.360
<i>Right away,</i>
<i>Damo was in the gang, so to speak.</i>

13:56.440 --> 13:59.200
Really good lad, down to earth,
willing to work hard for the team.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.480
I just think Damo was, again,
another perfect fit.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.640
And I think that's what Dougie got right
with those players coming in.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.960
They were just a perfect fit
for Crystal Palace.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.600
He's even said stories,
he was ready to give up.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.400
Thankfully he came
to Palace and found,

14:13.480 --> 14:15.320
so I suppose, his footballing home.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.680
I think he proved a lot of people wrong
in the end.

14:17.760 --> 14:21.040
Yeah, he was a great signing and, yeah,
a great teammate, a great person.

14:21.120 --> 14:25.520
2-1, got an assist and I was
just thinking, "Yeah, this fits."

14:25.600 --> 14:27.760
You know, Wilf, Glenn, me.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.960
And then that's when everything clicked

14:30.040 --> 14:33.960
and we started to really think
that we might have a chance.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.360
It just for some reason
clicked and worked.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.080
Obviously at the beginning,
things were a bit all over the place

14:39.160 --> 14:42.680
and things just fell into place
and we kind of understood

14:42.760 --> 14:45.640
<i>our roles and what we have to do.</i>
<i>Dougie made it just clear,</i>

14:45.720 --> 14:47.840
<i>defenders just defend.</i>

14:47.920 --> 14:50.360
<i>Pete Ramage got moved in</i>
<i>to play centre-back.</i>

14:50.440 --> 14:52.120
<i>Wardy came into the team</i>
<i>because he was injured</i>

14:52.200 --> 14:53.320
<i>when he first signed if I remember.</i>

14:53.400 --> 14:55.320
I had played in a few different positions

14:55.400 --> 14:58.520
and I wanted to cement my position
at right-back

14:58.600 --> 15:00.320
and that was the game plan really.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.160
<i>And then with Dean Moxey</i>
<i>playing left-back.</i>

15:02.240 --> 15:03.800
I'd obviously had
that relationship with Damo.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.920
Even at QPR, we never played
centre-back together.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.600
He was always left-back,
I was right-back,

15:07.680 --> 15:09.800
<i>but we just obviously knew</i>
<i>each other's games.</i>

15:09.880 --> 15:12.000
Just a big, ugly, solid

15:12.080 --> 15:14.240
foundation of the group
with Jules behind,

15:14.320 --> 15:15.640
it kinda just fitted.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.560
<i>Mile and KG in the middle</i>

15:17.640 --> 15:19.320
<i>they were just going around</i>
<i>breaking things down</i>

15:19.400 --> 15:20.560
<i>and just giving it to the wingers.</i>

15:20.640 --> 15:23.680
Mile was just, to me,
still one of the best

15:23.760 --> 15:25.440
of all the midfield players
I've ever come across.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.520
He just turned into our captain,
led by example every game.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.440
Yeah, it was a pleasure
to play with him.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.000
<i>You know, whoever was in front of Mile,</i>
<i>whether it's Garvs</i>

15:33.080 --> 15:35.160
<i>or Jonny Williams or Andre Moritz...</i>

15:35.240 --> 15:38.640
Dougie would play me one of the three
in 4-2-3-1...

15:38.720 --> 15:40.680
I mean, he would play me anywhere in them.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.600
<i>Some people are there to just attack,</i>
<i>that's what me and Yannick did.</i>

15:43.680 --> 15:45.640
Basically, they were my legs.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.960
<i>Me and Yannick two wingers</i>
<i>that are fast and strong.</i>

15:49.040 --> 15:51.000
<i>'Cause he's a different sort of player</i>

15:51.080 --> 15:53.480
<i>who then we just used to rotate</i>
<i>and get a feel.</i>

15:53.560 --> 15:56.800
<i>Glenn, he'd just be in the box,</i>
<i>don't expect him to do anything else.</i>

15:56.880 --> 15:58.600
<i>I was the battering ram</i>
<i>and they ran off me.</i>

15:58.680 --> 16:00.720
<i>Probably the last of the old-fashioned</i>
<i>number nines</i>

16:00.800 --> 16:02.600
<i>left in the world to be honest with you.</i>

16:02.680 --> 16:04.440
<i>It's just a really good</i>
<i>all coming together.</i>

16:04.520 --> 16:05.600
I mean, once we started winning games,

16:05.680 --> 16:07.200
we just couldn't get off
that winning run then.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.680
I can remember Damo, like, saying,

16:08.760 --> 16:10.560
"Listen, lads,
we're not that great individually

16:10.640 --> 16:12.800
apart from maybe Wilf and Yala,

16:12.880 --> 16:14.600
so we've got to work as a team
more than ever."

16:14.680 --> 16:17.000
We were first and foremost
really hard to beat,

16:17.080 --> 16:21.840
and, like, Rambo and Damo just loved
defending and heading, didn't they?

16:21.920 --> 16:26.240
And I have to say, I've been involved
in many teams in my career

16:26.320 --> 16:29.520
and I don't think I've ever, ever
come across a group of players

16:29.600 --> 16:33.320
as focused and disciplined,
as mentally, sort of, strong

16:33.400 --> 16:34.720
as that group of players.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.120
So all of a sudden
we had a very good platform.

16:37.200 --> 16:43.000
With that defence of solid foundations,
with the ability to go and hurt teams.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.800
<i>And then we were kind of up and running.</i>
<i>I think we then went to Charlton.</i>

16:45.880 --> 16:47.240
<i>Here's Wiggins.</i>

16:47.720 --> 16:51.880
<i>That's not a bad cross</i>
<i>and Jonathan Parr has to steer that away.</i>

16:52.280 --> 16:53.600
<i>Garvan's corner.</i>

16:53.680 --> 16:55.080
<i>Finds Delaney.</i>

16:55.160 --> 16:59.000
<i>A falls to... Dikgacoi!</i>
<i>What a strike that is.</i>

16:59.080 --> 17:02.280
<i>Kagisho Dikgacoi.</i>
<i>And he puts Palace ahead.</i>

17:02.360 --> 17:06.440
<i>KG, next to Mile going around</i>
<i>and breaking things down,</i>

17:06.520 --> 17:08.640
<i>technically, he was unbelievable as well.</i>

17:08.720 --> 17:11.360
<i>His volley against Charlton away...</i>

17:11.440 --> 17:15.800
Say, like, goals like that,
it's not just about breaking things down <i>,</i>

17:15.880 --> 17:18.160
we had quality as well.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.720
<i>This cross is going to find</i>
<i>Ricardo Fuller</i>

17:20.800 --> 17:22.600
<i>whose shot is deflected.</i>

17:22.680 --> 17:26.480
<i>And Speroni with a hand under the frame</i>
<i>of his own goal</i>

17:26.560 --> 17:28.280
<i>to keep Charlton out.</i>

17:29.520 --> 17:31.800
Everyone dug in so deep for each other.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.880
And it was just about the team,
nothing else.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.920
<i>Our performance was fantastic,</i>
<i>we played very expansive football.</i>

17:38.000 --> 17:39.600
<i>And they're gonna only have</i>
<i>one or two opportunities,</i>

17:39.680 --> 17:42.000
you understand that, and you know,
on another night they may have went in

17:42.080 --> 17:44.320
but tonight I thought
overall we deserved that win.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.120
Okay, we're sort of finding our feet,

17:47.200 --> 17:49.760
not ideal to lose the games
that you do at the start,

17:49.840 --> 17:53.160
but it quickly changes
and then you just...

17:53.240 --> 17:56.480
For me, it was tunnel vision,
it was about growing with the group

17:56.560 --> 18:00.840
and this is what we need to do
in order to be the best we can be

18:00.920 --> 18:04.040
and hopefully something great
can be achieved.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.200
That was the best thing, I think,
that could ever happen to us,

18:06.280 --> 18:08.280
win at Charlton, partisan atmosphere.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.080
<i>KG scored ridiculous volley,</i>

18:10.160 --> 18:12.040
<i>just like a different team.</i>

18:12.120 --> 18:14.160
The atmosphere
all of a sudden was great.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.560
Suddenly out of nowhere,
we found a bit of steely resilience.

18:25.640 --> 18:28.240
<i>Then we started playing</i>
<i>some joyful football.</i>

18:30.280 --> 18:31.600
<i>This one comes</i>
<i>to the far post looking for</i>

18:31.680 --> 18:35.480
<i>Dikgacoi! The Palace recovery continues.</i>

18:35.560 --> 18:37.200
<i>Forest equalized</i>
<i>with about eight minutes to go.</i>

18:37.280 --> 18:39.240
<i>The season before</i>
<i>or the season before that</i>

18:39.320 --> 18:41.720
Palace fans would have left the game
really disappointed, so typical,

18:41.800 --> 18:44.080
but the football had been so good

18:44.160 --> 18:45.680
that everyone left thinking,
"That was brilliant."

18:45.760 --> 18:48.600
<i>It was a great atmosphere</i>
<i>all around the ground.</i>

18:48.680 --> 18:51.760
<i>Hereâs Gunnarsson, into the area,</i>
<i>great chance one on one, slides it home</i>

18:51.840 --> 18:54.960
<i>and Cardiff have the lead here,</i>
<i>very much against the run of play.</i>

18:55.040 --> 18:56.600
<i>It's not often you get to play in teams</i>

18:56.680 --> 18:58.920
<i>where you have a sense</i>
<i>of inevitability</i>

18:59.480 --> 19:00.720
of the result.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.840
We just had this sense that
if they scored one, if they scored two,

19:03.920 --> 19:07.040
we'd score three. We were that confident,
we were on a huge high at the time.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.640
We always created chances.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.960
<i>Even if we conceded a goal or two,</i>
<i>we knew we were going to create a chance.</i>

19:12.040 --> 19:13.720
And we had Glenn there
to put 'em away so.<i>..</i>

19:13.800 --> 19:16.800
<i>And Murray turned into this goal machine.</i>

19:16.880 --> 19:19.880
Once I started scoring goals,
I cracked it.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.320
<i>And from then on in, the momentum</i>
<i>of the front three in the group</i>

19:22.400 --> 19:23.520
<i>just took us on.</i>

19:23.600 --> 19:27.280
Once you whip that ball in,
Glenn is always in the right place.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.680
<i>Like, his movement was a joke.</i>

19:28.760 --> 19:30.360
<i>Glenn's not the fastest,</i>
<i>he's not the strongest,</i>

19:30.440 --> 19:32.400
<i>but he's so intelligent</i>
<i>in the way he plays.</i>

19:32.480 --> 19:33.880
<i>Brilliant for Palace.</i>

19:33.960 --> 19:36.280
<i>They deservedly find a way back</i>
<i>into this game.</i>

19:36.360 --> 19:37.920
<i>Crystal Palace, 2, Cardiff, 2.</i>

19:38.000 --> 19:39.920
That front three worked so well.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.240
I think that front three was as potent
as I've ever seen in the championship.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.520
<i>When you got the type of pace</i>
<i>that Wilf and Yannick had,</i>

19:46.600 --> 19:49.880
<i>and then you got Muzza who is happy</i>
<i>to stand up in the middle of the pitch</i>

19:49.960 --> 19:53.280
<i>and wait for crosses to come in the box,</i>
<i>but his hold-up play was brilliant.</i>

19:53.360 --> 19:54.920
<i>Muz would probably hate me</i>
<i>for saying it,</i>

19:55.000 --> 19:56.600
<i>but he didn't look the most mobile</i>
<i>but he actually was,</i>

19:56.680 --> 19:57.840
he got about the pitch.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.600
And he held the ball up great
and he scored goals.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.200
<i>Murray's made no mistake.</i>

20:01.280 --> 20:03.680
I just remember the performance
and we walked off the pitch

20:03.760 --> 20:06.640
and we were like, "Great.
Another one down, we go again."

20:09.120 --> 20:10.800
<i>Here's Zaha coming forward.</i>

20:10.880 --> 20:13.240
<i>Wilfried is a wonderful player</i>
<i>and a wonderful young man.</i>

20:13.320 --> 20:15.040
You know, he was playing
some of his best stuff.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.480
That urged me to do my stuff.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.160
You know, we used to get the license
from all the players.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.480
First minute of the game...

20:21.560 --> 20:25.840
run him, see what he is about.
Mind game, basically.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.320
<i>Here is Zaha again,</i>
<i>lots of white shirts around him.</i>

20:28.400 --> 20:30.800
<i>Gets the shot away</i>
<i>and he's denied once more.</i>

20:30.880 --> 20:32.960
<i>It's all going through Zaha</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>

20:33.040 --> 20:35.440
Championship was just a joy at times.

20:36.240 --> 20:37.640
<i>Here's Zaha again.</i>

20:37.720 --> 20:40.040
<i>Knight goes in with the challenge.</i>
<i>It's a penalty.</i>

20:40.640 --> 20:43.080
<i>Murray converts, Palace lead.</i>

20:43.160 --> 20:45.920
<i>It is four wins from five for the Eagles.</i>

20:46.520 --> 20:50.040
He can move all over the pitch.
Playing against him is hard, really hard.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.520
<i>My first training session with the group,</i>
<i>he put one through my legs.</i>

20:53.600 --> 20:56.360
<i>I was like, "Oh, I'll have</i>
<i>to be careful about that."</i>

20:56.440 --> 20:59.640
Not to say that it didn't happen
a few times after that.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.960
Wilfried was obviously technically good.
You could see that.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.360
<i>And Yannick was just so raw,</i>
<i>but it worked.</i>

21:04.440 --> 21:05.520
I don't know how, but it did.

21:05.600 --> 21:09.400
I can see, he still plays like
he does when he was 13-14.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.560
<i>Gets the ball, and beats players,</i>
<i>that's what he does best.</i>

21:11.640 --> 21:13.400
<i>What a goal, Wilfried Zaha!</i>

21:13.480 --> 21:16.200
<i>Always knew he'd go on</i>
<i>and do what he's done to be honest,</i>

21:16.280 --> 21:18.880
<i>because he had that mind-set</i>
<i>where nothing would stop him.</i>

21:18.960 --> 21:21.320
<i>Simply magical from Wilfried Zaha!</i>

21:21.400 --> 21:22.640
<i>What a player!</i>

21:22.720 --> 21:26.160
That was one of the games where you look
and saw what Wilf could do to teams.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.360
And I think people
started to take notice.

21:28.440 --> 21:29.680
<i>Simply sensational!</i>

21:29.760 --> 21:33.280
<i>It was just like that consistently,</i>
<i>and when you're like that consistently,</i>

21:33.360 --> 21:35.080
<i>you just take it onto</i>
<i>the field naturally.</i>

21:36.200 --> 21:38.160
It's amazing to see the atmosphere
change so quickly,

21:38.240 --> 21:41.120
and within weeks, game against Burnley,
when we went 2-0 down.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.920
<i>Doesn't matter,</i>
<i>we're gonna start scoring.</i>

21:43.000 --> 21:45.400
Counter-attacking the back four
and the two sitting midfield players

21:45.480 --> 21:47.520
<i>defended, and when we won the ball back,</i>
<i>we knew we had</i>

21:47.600 --> 21:49.280
<i>two wide players</i>
<i>that could carry up the pitch</i>

21:49.360 --> 21:51.680
<i>very, very quickly,</i>
<i>and we executed that brilliantly.</i>

21:53.840 --> 21:55.600
<i>Wilfried Zaha pulls one back.</i>

22:01.960 --> 22:03.280
<i>It's 2-2.</i>

22:03.360 --> 22:04.760
<i>Wilfried Zaha with the double.</i>

22:07.800 --> 22:10.720
<i>It is 3-2, Palace in front.</i>

22:10.800 --> 22:12.600
<i>Remarkable comeback.</i>

22:15.200 --> 22:17.240
<i>A cross from Murray and it's four.</i>

22:17.960 --> 22:20.200
<i>What an extraordinary run Palace are on.</i>

22:25.080 --> 22:27.640
<i>You could see fans bit by bit thinking,</i>

22:27.720 --> 22:29.320
<i>"We're quite good, aren't we?"</i>

22:29.920 --> 22:31.440
It was a great feeling, really.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.400
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>in a long time that anybody had</i>

22:33.480 --> 22:35.200
<i>a spring in their step</i>
<i>going to Selhurst Park.</i>

22:35.280 --> 22:36.720
<i>And it's all the better</i>
<i>for coming out of the blue,</i>

22:36.800 --> 22:38.360
<i>and for being totally unexpected,</i>

22:38.440 --> 22:41.040
<i>and the atmosphere</i>
<i>for the first time in years was buoyant,</i>

22:41.120 --> 22:42.200
<i>it was wonderful.</i>

22:49.000 --> 22:51.480
When I think about the changing room
at Palace.

22:52.040 --> 22:55.560
Togetherness, yeah, the best,
the best I've seen.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.600
<i>Dougie would do quite a lot work</i>
<i>with the attackers.</i>

22:57.680 --> 22:59.400
<i>Obviously,</i>
<i>being a centre-forward himself,</i>

22:59.480 --> 23:01.640
<i>had some great drills, individual work,</i>

23:01.720 --> 23:05.280
<i>would take a lot of time</i>
<i>working with those players.</i>

23:05.360 --> 23:08.040
It wasn't anything
you haven't seen before in training.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.680
It was very rigid and very disciplined,

23:09.760 --> 23:12.120
and I think that's a really,
really important part

23:12.200 --> 23:14.280
of a team now, you know,
you have to be disciplined.

23:14.360 --> 23:18.520
You have to be as effective
without the ball as you are with the ball.

23:18.600 --> 23:22.000
Everyone was clear and knew
what they were required to do.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.160
Working back as a winger,

23:23.240 --> 23:27.400
we used to come back inside
to the centre midfielders

23:27.480 --> 23:29.600
<i>and nip it behind their</i>
<i>centre midfielders,</i>

23:29.680 --> 23:30.760
<i>and then break off.</i>

23:30.840 --> 23:33.240
When I think about it now,
yeah, that was different,

23:33.320 --> 23:36.640
but it used to work all the time.
So tactically, Dougie was spot on for me.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.480
<i>We'd go into games knowing</i>
<i>exactly what we need to do.</i>

23:39.560 --> 23:42.120
It's what you play football for,
for times like that, really,

23:42.200 --> 23:46.080
it's not always that straightforward,
but when you're in a team with flair,

23:46.160 --> 23:47.680
you got players
that are solid at the back,

23:47.760 --> 23:50.840
and we had a goalie in Jules,
you know, you could rely upon.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.400
He pulled off some incredible saves.

23:52.480 --> 23:55.600
<i>And that's why obviously,</i>
<i>he was the legend that he was.</i>

23:55.680 --> 23:58.640
And he achieved all that he achieved,
especially with the club.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.480
I think the key was
to have a good understanding,

24:01.560 --> 24:03.240
a trust between us.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.480
That we always have each other's back.

24:06.040 --> 24:09.440
And the passion also, you know,
to do well for the club.

24:09.520 --> 24:13.000
I mean we put everything in there,
every single time you step on that pitch,

24:13.080 --> 24:16.000
we just give 100% all the time.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.320
And that's something that the fans
still appreciate from that team.

24:19.400 --> 24:23.360
<i>We build a very, very strong</i>
<i>passion, high spirit team.</i>

24:23.440 --> 24:27.760
We just kept at it with our full focus,
and we went on an amazing run.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.560
It was like that, you know,
the whole tunnel vision thing,

24:30.640 --> 24:32.360
we couldn't really get
too caught up in it,

24:32.440 --> 24:34.360
because there was such
a long time to go.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.720
And we all knew championship season
can be long,

24:36.800 --> 24:39.080
and there's gonna be
so many twists and turns.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.880
Mile was a strong personality

24:41.960 --> 24:44.240
and massive will to win games of football.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.040
Not maybe the most vocal of captains,
he could let people know,

24:47.120 --> 24:50.360
but he wasn't
a massive kind of, you know, talker.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.480
But my God, he led from
the front, you know,

24:52.560 --> 24:54.080
and when you saw Mile doing things,
you kind of went,

24:54.160 --> 24:56.080
"Oh, well, if he's doing it,
I better do it as well."

24:56.160 --> 24:58.120
A man mountain, I mean, he really was.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.360
And as a centre-back,
to have someone like that

24:59.440 --> 25:00.960
in front of you, absolutely brilliant.

25:01.040 --> 25:04.360
The warrior amongst the dressing room
that everybody looked up to.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.400
<i>He was great.</i>

25:05.480 --> 25:08.600
<i>He was key in that role,</i>
<i>organizing the team.</i>

25:08.680 --> 25:12.120
All the individuals
that we have built that team,

25:12.200 --> 25:15.480
and then we created
that special bond between us

25:15.560 --> 25:17.680
to then go and perform and do well.

25:18.920 --> 25:22.000
<i>19 points from their last</i>
<i>seven games for Crystal Palace.</i>

25:22.080 --> 25:24.960
<i>Dougie Freedman's men come in</i>
<i>to this South London Derby</i>

25:25.040 --> 25:26.520
<i>in excellent form.</i>

25:28.000 --> 25:29.200
<i>Here's Zaha.</i>

25:29.840 --> 25:33.920
<i>He's got away from two here,</i>
<i>and is still going. Tries his luck.</i>

25:34.000 --> 25:37.040
<i>And that would have been a fine,</i>
<i>fine strike had it gone in.</i>

25:38.040 --> 25:40.400
<i>Square now to Jedinak, 35 yards out.</i>

25:40.480 --> 25:41.720
<i>Goes for goal!</i>

25:41.800 --> 25:44.520
<i>Oh, what a sensational strike!</i>

25:44.600 --> 25:47.080
<i>Mile Jedinak scores for Crystal Palace!</i>

25:48.960 --> 25:51.080
<i>It's into the area, free header.</i>

25:51.160 --> 25:55.880
<i>And its 2-0, and Damien Delaney</i>
<i>has got his second goal</i>

25:55.960 --> 25:58.120
<i>for Crystal Palace in two games!</i>

25:58.200 --> 26:01.120
<i>And Palace in total charge</i>
<i>of this London derby.</i>

26:01.200 --> 26:02.840
<i>Everything was going</i>
<i>in the right direction,</i>

26:03.800 --> 26:06.520
just incredibly exciting.
And then we played Millwall.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.360
But just prior to the game,
Phil had grabbed me,

26:09.440 --> 26:11.360
and said we've had a phone call
from Bolton.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.840
They'd like permission
to speak to the manager.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.080
<i>We'd played Bolton a few weeks before,</i>

26:28.160 --> 26:30.520
<i>and we got a very good result</i>
<i>against them.</i>

26:30.600 --> 26:34.720
<i>And there was no hiding the fact</i>
<i>that they really admired our team,</i>

26:34.800 --> 26:37.120
<i>and really admired</i>
<i>the way we were playing.</i>

26:37.200 --> 26:40.960
<i>And they were very open in telling me</i>
<i>that what a great job I'd done.</i>

26:41.040 --> 26:43.760
Back in the bus,
I thought, that's a club

26:43.840 --> 26:48.400
you know, that's just come down,
that needs some energy put in it.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.800
You know, my contract was up,
six months to go,

26:51.880 --> 26:53.680
<i>and there was always</i>
<i>the back of my head thinking,</i>

26:53.760 --> 26:56.680
<i>"What is the next six months</i>
<i>gonna have in store for myself?"</i>

26:56.760 --> 26:59.000
So that was the first time
I kind of had an inclination

26:59.080 --> 27:00.360
that they were interested.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.080
I suppose, looking back,
I had an appreciation

27:06.160 --> 27:08.920
that these times,
these moments in your life,

27:09.000 --> 27:10.880
where everything's going for you,

27:10.960 --> 27:12.720
they don't come along often.

27:12.800 --> 27:16.880
A player that was a hero of the club,
who'd saved the club so many times.

27:16.960 --> 27:20.680
A chairman that supported the club
since he was four years old.

27:20.760 --> 27:24.000
Two people who didn't really know
what they were doing when they started,

27:24.080 --> 27:26.520
that hadn't been told
it was all impossible.

27:26.600 --> 27:30.120
So, I just couldn't understand
why he wanted to throw that away.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.440
Dougie, everyone's on your side.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.880
Everybody wants you to succeed.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.400
If we get this team promoted,

27:37.960 --> 27:41.720
it would just be the most fantastic
achievement of your life.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.160
One of the journalists
mentioned after the game

27:44.240 --> 27:45.720
that he heard about it.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.840
But obviously at that point,
I and all the other media,

27:47.920 --> 27:49.160
hadn't heard anything at all about it.

27:49.240 --> 27:52.200
And then on the Sunday morning,
it was in the national papers.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.280
<i>Now at that point,</i>
<i>you know there's been some conversations.</i>

27:55.360 --> 27:57.000
<i>Nobody rings you about your manager</i>

27:57.080 --> 28:00.000
without some kind of idea
that they can get the manager.

28:00.080 --> 28:03.240
That made a pretty tense conversation
with me and Dougie after the game.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.720
I found the approach incredible.
It bamboozled me.

28:05.800 --> 28:09.160
Because we were building something
that was so exciting.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.280
And I know how difficult
that is to do in football.

28:11.360 --> 28:14.120
If you can get a football club
all pulling in the right direction,

28:14.200 --> 28:16.720
it's an incredible thing,
but it's very difficult to do.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.120
It was after the game.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.560
Steve had said to me
that Bolton have enquired

28:20.640 --> 28:22.720
and they've asked to speak to you.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.320
<i>I actually wasn't very happy</i>
<i>about the game,</i>

28:25.400 --> 28:27.760
<i>we were 2-0 up and then</i>
<i>Moxey got sent off,</i>

28:27.840 --> 28:31.200
<i>and we went very deep defensively</i>
<i>and they drew 2-2.</i>

28:31.280 --> 28:32.640
<i>By this time me and Steve</i>

28:32.720 --> 28:35.440
had a real strong
in-your-face relationship

28:35.520 --> 28:37.400
that was bouncing off each other,
the energy.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.040
And we agreed to meet
at the training ground

28:39.120 --> 28:40.080
and speak the next day on it.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.280
We had a meeting that Sunday,
and it was a very strange meeting

28:43.360 --> 28:45.920
because we're supposed to meet
at Selhurst Park, and that was locked.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.920
<i>So we had to try and find somewhere that</i>

28:48.000 --> 28:49.720
<i>we could go meet,</i>
<i>and we ended up meeting</i>

28:49.800 --> 28:53.520
<i>at the training ground where there was</i>
<i>an under 15-16 games going on.</i>

28:53.600 --> 28:56.000
<i>It was quite busy</i>
<i>and it was all quite rushed.</i>

28:56.080 --> 28:57.360
<i>I just thought, "Listen,</i>

28:57.440 --> 28:59.760
<i>this is what it is, but we'll resolve it.</i>

28:59.840 --> 29:01.800
<i>Maybe we need to</i>
<i>look at the contract."</i>

29:01.880 --> 29:04.160
Bolton had made it very, very clear,

29:04.240 --> 29:06.000
that they would like me
to be their manager.

29:06.080 --> 29:08.240
<i>They made it very clear</i>
<i>I was their number one target.</i>

29:08.320 --> 29:09.280
<i>And it was very flattering.</i>

29:09.360 --> 29:12.240
Of course, looking back on it,
I could have done more to stop that.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.480
I didn't want to break
the spell of the moment.

29:14.560 --> 29:18.240
It's so important to maintain
all of the ingredients

29:18.320 --> 29:20.360
that you've got,
that have led to that success.

29:20.440 --> 29:23.120
And some of that, you know,
is proving yourself

29:23.200 --> 29:27.200
and that was what Dougie was doing.
And to talk about contracts and money,

29:27.280 --> 29:29.160
and maybe not agree on everything,

29:29.240 --> 29:31.760
I just really felt
it would break that spell.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.800
I didn't want bad conversations,
or difficult conversations,

29:34.880 --> 29:36.440
I just wanted good conversations.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.240
<i>We sat down, and we were</i>
<i>always very open with each other.</i>

29:39.320 --> 29:42.240
<i>And Steve offered me a contract,</i>
<i>an improved contract</i>

29:42.320 --> 29:46.000
and he'd offered me a considerable
lot more money than I was on.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.240
<i>What should I have done</i>
<i>to prevent that happening?</i>

29:48.320 --> 29:51.120
<i>What should I have done</i>
<i>to prevent the moment</i>

29:51.200 --> 29:52.880
<i>that Dougie wanted to leave?</i>

29:52.960 --> 29:54.720
<i>And then even then,</i>
<i>I didn't think he would.</i>

29:54.800 --> 29:56.920
I thought I would go down
to the training ground on Sunday.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.120
We would air some grievances.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.720
We would all put
our arms around each other,

29:59.800 --> 30:00.960
it would all be fine,

30:01.040 --> 30:03.520
but by the time I got there,
I realized it was a runaway train.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.120
<i>I offered him a really improved contract</i>

30:05.200 --> 30:08.720
and delivered the fact that he was
unbelievably valuable to us

30:08.800 --> 30:10.400
and, you know, that I wanted him to stay.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.600
I remember saying to him,
"Why do you think Bolton want you?

30:12.680 --> 30:14.440
They don't want you because
they're gonna give you lots of money

30:14.520 --> 30:16.440
and give you all the things we haven't.
They want you because they think

30:16.520 --> 30:18.800
you can make it work with very little.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.000
that's what they're attracted to.
It won't be any different.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.880
You'll just be starting
from a worse place

30:22.960 --> 30:24.680
because you don't have
the team you want,

30:24.760 --> 30:26.680
you don't have the people
you want around you."

30:26.760 --> 30:28.120
Being a football player
doesn't really teach you

30:28.200 --> 30:30.880
how to be a manager.
And I was a young manager at the time,

30:30.960 --> 30:33.280
and I didn't really have
the experience to handle

30:33.360 --> 30:34.960
the attention that I was getting.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.240
And of course, you know,

30:36.880 --> 30:39.600
one has a huge ego
when you're doing well.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.000
<i>It had never happened to me before.</i>

30:42.080 --> 30:44.880
<i>My circle of influence</i>
<i>was wrong at the time.</i>

30:45.280 --> 30:48.960
<i>You know, I was too impatient,</i>
<i>I didn't really know what I had.</i>

30:49.040 --> 30:50.720
You know, I didn't know
what I was building

30:50.800 --> 30:54.080
because I hadn't had
the experience to reflect on it.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.440
It was all energy, it was all on ego.
It was all pushing forward.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.120
In hindsight, I don't think
he was well advised, Dougie.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.960
When they came back to play us,

31:01.040 --> 31:05.200
<i>Lenny said, this lot, as in me,</i>
<i>they won't get promoted.</i>

31:05.280 --> 31:06.440
<i>They won't do the right things.</i>

31:06.520 --> 31:09.560
<i>They won't spend the money,</i>
<i>they're not serious.</i>

31:09.640 --> 31:13.120
And I wonder how much that had an impact
on Dougie at the time.

31:13.200 --> 31:16.200
And things happened so fast
over the next 48 hours.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.200
<i>I could tell</i>
<i>he was in a bit of a maelstrom.</i>

31:18.280 --> 31:21.640
<i>And I think that's where I probably</i>
<i>could have handled it better.</i>

31:21.720 --> 31:24.040
<i>I should've put</i>
<i>my arm around him and,</i>

31:24.120 --> 31:26.840
<i>you know, I should have</i>
<i>really made him feel valued.</i>

31:26.920 --> 31:29.880
Looking back, I should've
maybe taken a few more days

31:29.960 --> 31:33.280
to sit down and think what I had
on my plate at the time.

31:33.360 --> 31:36.960
Steve had given it a go
that Sunday, if anything,

31:37.040 --> 31:40.120
if there's any criticism put on the board,
it's maybe, you know,

31:40.200 --> 31:42.400
earlier discussions could've
maybe been taken place.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.760
But obviously on that Monday morning,
the team were in at the training ground

31:45.840 --> 31:47.160
preparing for their next match

31:47.240 --> 31:49.680
which was just on the Tuesday night
away at Barnsley.

31:49.760 --> 31:53.400
I drove up and was told that
Dougie was up at Bolton.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.080
But the interesting thing was that,

31:55.160 --> 31:57.760
even though a lot of people
thought the deal was already done,

31:57.840 --> 32:01.080
negotiations were still ongoing,
and it certainly wasn't a done deal

32:01.160 --> 32:03.320
as we kicked off at Barnsley
on the Tuesday evening.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.120
And then it got difficult

32:05.200 --> 32:08.200
because he was trying to take pretty much
everybody with him.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.920
It felt like, "Well, we're leaving you.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.960
You won't be successful now,
but we will be."

32:15.040 --> 32:18.000
So we've got to make sure that
that success is all organized.

32:18.080 --> 32:19.640
We're in discussions
and we'll get back to you.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.320
And I literally didn't know
who was gonna be on the touchline.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.080
I mean, it just wouldn't happen
in any other business.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.200
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

32:25.280 --> 32:27.640
<i>So you're going,</i>
<i>but we've all got to sit around waiting</i>

32:27.720 --> 32:31.160
<i>while you organize stealing</i>
<i>all the other members of staff as well.</i>

32:31.240 --> 32:33.840
In the end, I got quite angry about it.
"Dougie, look, what's happening?

32:33.920 --> 32:34.880
Are you going? Are you staying?

32:34.960 --> 32:36.480
We need to know,
you know, we've got a game."

32:36.560 --> 32:39.000
Looking back, I don't think
Steve or the board

32:39.080 --> 32:40.880
could have done anything on that Sunday.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.560
<i>More than they did,</i>
<i>it was through my own wrongdoings.</i>

32:44.640 --> 32:46.800
Looking back,
I really should've just said to him,

32:46.880 --> 32:48.880
"Dougie, I don't think
it's the right thing to do.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.200
Just don't do it.
Just stay, don't do it."

32:51.280 --> 32:53.680
It wasn't the way
I'd have liked to have left it,

32:53.760 --> 32:55.640
but it was a decision I made.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.480
Even at the end,
I kinda left the door open

32:59.440 --> 33:02.360
for him to change his mind,
but he didn't.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.880
<i>Crystal Palace have parted company</i>
<i>with Dougie Freedman.</i>

33:08.960 --> 33:11.720
<i>The Scot has agreed to take charge</i>
<i>of Bolton Wanderers.</i>

33:11.800 --> 33:15.800
<i>The former Palace player</i>
<i>has signed a 2.5 year deal at the Reebok.</i>

33:16.600 --> 33:19.240
And it was a real shock,
couldn't believe it.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.800
And there was nothing really
we could do about it.

33:21.880 --> 33:25.640
I probably didn't expect him to go.
No, if I'm honest.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.880
<i>Dougie was absolutely in his moment,</i>

33:27.960 --> 33:30.520
<i>the players were</i>
<i>completely in his thrall.</i>

33:30.600 --> 33:33.080
If he had said to them,
walk through that wall,

33:33.160 --> 33:35.120
I have no doubt that they'd have
walked through that wall.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.240
Everyone had a great relationship
with Dougie.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.840
The players were really,
really disappointed.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.960
<i>We were gutted. Dougie was one of</i>
<i>the main reasons why I joined.</i>

33:43.040 --> 33:44.200
And I can remember
being in the gym here

33:44.280 --> 33:47.280
and word got out that
Dougie was coming in to say his goodbyes

33:47.360 --> 33:48.720
and the lads all had
to come into the gym,

33:48.800 --> 33:50.640
and it was quite emotional.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.200
He came in, he was in tears, leaving us.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.000
I think he realized what he'd built,
and what we were capable of achieving,

33:56.080 --> 33:57.880
and that he wasn't
potentially gonna be there

33:57.960 --> 34:01.720
to see the final, kind of, product
he had spent so hard to kind of build up.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.800
Dougie got upset.
I think a few of the players,

34:04.880 --> 34:06.480
got a little bit upset as well.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.240
<i>It was a sad moment to be honest.</i>

34:08.320 --> 34:10.280
He'd come and sat us,
he was in tears as well.

34:10.360 --> 34:13.040
For me personally,
that was a sad moment as well.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.120
He's the one that gave me some life,
you know,

34:15.200 --> 34:17.480
and some confidence in my own ability.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.960
And at that time,
that we just started to fly.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.040
<i>On a personal level,</i>
<i>I wanted him to stay at the club</i>

34:22.120 --> 34:23.320
<i>because things were going so well.</i>

34:23.400 --> 34:24.720
And yes, he got to say his goodbyes.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.840
And then, you know, he rang us each
individually as well

34:26.920 --> 34:28.640
which, you know,
it was a special conversation

34:28.720 --> 34:31.960
that I had with him
and, you know, I still cherish now.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.040
And then he left, walked out,
and that was it.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.800
I think we all felt we were
onto something special.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.080
He left us when we're going...
we're playing well.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.440
It looked like it was in our hands.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.640
And it was still a lot,
a long way to go in the season.

34:43.720 --> 34:47.080
And with the players we had,
and with Muzza scoring, surprised.

34:47.160 --> 34:48.920
I... Yeah, I personally,

34:49.000 --> 34:51.160
I just couldn't
understand what happened.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.000
Because we were doing so well.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.760
We finally, after years of struggling,

34:55.840 --> 35:00.120
we had a very good chance
to push for promotion.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.280
We were close to the top of the league.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.240
And all of a sudden, the manager's gone.

35:06.320 --> 35:09.920
<i>I suppose Dougie kind of being</i>
<i>with Palace for so long</i>

35:10.000 --> 35:11.400
<i>and hindsight's a wonderful thing.</i>

35:11.480 --> 35:13.400
And I'm pretty sure if you said to him,
you know,

35:13.480 --> 35:15.360
"Should you have stayed?",
obviously, he would've said he would've,

35:15.440 --> 35:17.640
but everybody makes decisions in life

35:17.720 --> 35:20.320
and Dougie made what he felt
was the best at that time.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.480
I would never judge anyone for that.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.200
<i>You know, I had a little bit</i>
<i>of a chat to Dougie</i>

35:23.280 --> 35:26.280
but we couldn't afford
to get caught up in at all.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.160
<i>At that time,</i>
<i>you're a little bit pissed-off,</i>

35:29.240 --> 35:30.720
<i>you feel a little bit betrayed,</i>

35:30.800 --> 35:32.720
<i>fans really fell on</i>
<i>one side or the other.</i>

35:32.800 --> 35:34.640
<i>It was either my fault or Dougie's fault.</i>

35:34.720 --> 35:36.360
<i>And the truth is,</i>
<i>as with all these things,</i>

35:36.440 --> 35:37.400
<i>somewhere in-between.</i>

35:37.480 --> 35:41.080
To lose a big influence on
the dressing room as well as the club,

35:41.160 --> 35:42.400
and he was a club legend.

35:42.480 --> 35:45.520
<i>Steve phoned me, and he said,</i>
<i>"We're looking for a new manager, mate."</i>

35:45.600 --> 35:47.400
I said, "What?"

35:47.480 --> 35:48.840
I said, "Bolton!"

35:48.920 --> 35:51.440
We're on the cusp of something,
we're on, honestly

35:51.520 --> 35:53.240
on the verge of something big

35:53.320 --> 35:54.760
getting back this club
back to the Premier League

35:54.840 --> 35:58.000
by a legend at the club,
as the coach, as the manager.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.440
So I couldn't believe it.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.520
It was total, total shock.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.920
Out of nowhere,
we lost our manager.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.920
I couldn't see the logic in the move.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.200
<i>Steve Browett and Steve Parish,</i>
<i>were as in awe of,</i>

36:09.280 --> 36:10.840
Dougie as we were
'cause they're Palace fans.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.760
He was a legend to them as well.

36:12.840 --> 36:15.040
I felt he was growing as a manager

36:15.120 --> 36:18.280
with alongside us
as a young team, you know?

36:18.360 --> 36:21.640
And as a club, as a whole.
I thought we were all growing together.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.920
It's because we loved him so much.
He's such a legend.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.640
<i>He scored the goal that saved us,</i>

36:25.720 --> 36:27.760
<i>at Stockport from yet another relegation,</i>

36:27.840 --> 36:30.080
<i>that or he scored goals,</i>
<i>won us playoff games.</i>

36:30.160 --> 36:31.720
<i>You quite often get players who say,</i>
<i>"I love this club."</i>

36:31.800 --> 36:33.920
<i>He's one of the people</i>
<i>who clearly did love our club</i>

36:34.000 --> 36:35.240
<i>and kept coming back to it.</i>

36:35.320 --> 36:37.200
<i>And in this day and age, it's rare,</i>

36:37.280 --> 36:40.040
<i>for a manager to have</i>
<i>such a connection with his fans.</i>

36:47.880 --> 36:50.400
<i>When I played, I was an entertainer,</i>

36:50.480 --> 36:52.720
<i>not always necessarily a winner.</i>

36:52.800 --> 36:54.200
<i>I like to entertain people,</i>

36:54.280 --> 36:55.920
<i>and if some people</i>
<i>didn't like the way I played,</i>

36:56.000 --> 36:57.800
<i>I wasn't too fussed, so that was my</i>

36:57.880 --> 37:00.080
<i>attitude always</i>
<i>and if they didn't like how I managed,</i>

37:00.160 --> 37:01.280
<i>I wasn't too fussed.</i>

37:01.360 --> 37:04.920
Now of course, there was a fantastic bond
with me and the fans.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.360
Of course there was this,
you know, relationship

37:07.440 --> 37:09.320
<i>I'd had over many, many years</i>

37:09.400 --> 37:12.120
<i>from being a player, to a coach,</i>
<i>to being the manager.</i>

37:12.200 --> 37:15.160
I let myself down the way I acted,
there's no doubt about that.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.040
And I didn't think of the consequences.

37:17.120 --> 37:20.440
<i>That weekend</i>
<i>definitely tarnished the feelings</i>

37:20.520 --> 37:23.080
<i>towards myself in the last 20 odd years.</i>

37:23.160 --> 37:25.040
<i>And that's what I thrive</i>
<i>to try and make up.</i>

37:25.120 --> 37:27.040
It has to sit with me every day.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.720
If I can forgive myself
for a wrong decision,

37:30.800 --> 37:32.960
then hopefully everybody else will.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.480
<i>And I should have done more.</i>

37:34.560 --> 37:36.800
<i>And I love what he did for the club,</i>
<i>it's a shame, you know,</i>

37:36.880 --> 37:38.880
<i>because Dougie put in</i>
<i>a lot of work into that team.</i>

37:38.960 --> 37:40.720
<i>And we worked together so well.</i>

37:40.800 --> 37:44.000
<i>It would've been good</i>
<i>to see it through together.</i>

37:44.080 --> 37:46.440
Yeah, I remember...
I spoke to Dougie after that.

37:46.520 --> 37:49.840
But... Anyway, he had his reasons.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.360
I thought, "Here we go again."
What's gonna happen now, you know?

37:53.440 --> 37:57.320
Finally we had something good going on,
and now this.

37:57.400 --> 38:01.640
So it was... Yeah, it was strange
and hard to take.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.960
I knew I had made the wrong decision
very, very quickly

38:04.040 --> 38:07.960
into my Bolton career,
but it was the decision I made.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.800
Regrettably, it was a wrong decision.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.640
Looking back, of course,
I wouldn't have went,

38:11.720 --> 38:14.360
of course, you know, I'd have sat here
and we'd have had promotion.

38:14.440 --> 38:15.920
It was on the cards.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.920
Probably one of the things
that drives me on right now,

38:18.000 --> 38:22.480
you know, to make up for that
disappointing decision that I made.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.760
When Dougie went,
I mean, it felt like despair.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.440
I don't think many people after that

38:28.520 --> 38:30.840
really thought that we would
get promoted.

38:30.920 --> 38:34.040
And make no mistake,
it was on me.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.440
Worse, Dougie had gone to Bolton.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.240
Us not getting promoted
and Bolton being promoted,

38:40.320 --> 38:42.160
would have been unthinkable.

38:43.200 --> 38:46.080
<i>It went from</i>
<i>something I wanted to do badly,</i>

38:46.160 --> 38:48.120
<i>to something I had to do.</i>

38:48.200 --> 38:50.320
I was worried about
what was gonna happen with the boys

38:50.400 --> 38:52.800
and worried about what was gonna happen
the next game.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.560
And I knew I had a game to prepare for.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.840
Trying to move forward
as quick as you could,

38:56.920 --> 38:59.360
you don't want this
great run to end.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.960
We were winning games of football
and Dougie leaving

39:02.040 --> 39:03.680
was kind of almost like,
"Okay, Dougie's gone

39:03.760 --> 39:05.680
but we're still winning games here."

39:05.760 --> 39:08.680
And that was the will
and the mentality in the group.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.360
The main thing was, with the boys,

39:10.440 --> 39:14.160
the spine of the team
is what kept the boys together.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.480
We just had to get on with it.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.120
Dougie had made his decision,
he was going,

39:17.200 --> 39:19.680
and we just had to wait to see
who the next guy was gonna come in

39:19.760 --> 39:21.640
and hopefully he was gonna be a guy
that was gonna, you know,

39:21.720 --> 39:23.760
continue on what Dougie had built
over the,

39:23.840 --> 39:26.520
you know, the last two or three years
that he'd been there as manager.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.640
In those moments, really,
they galvanized me.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.960
That's the type of person I am.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.400
I knew we had to get a manager in,

39:34.480 --> 39:38.240
that could lead these players
and give them something

39:38.320 --> 39:40.440
even more if we could.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.760
And I knew I had to do it quickly.

39:43.320 --> 39:46.520
And for me, there was only one name
and it was Ian Holloway.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.240
<i>Kevin Phillips!</i>

40:02.840 --> 40:04.240
Shut up talking about Dougie.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.600
It's a rollercoaster, isn't it?

40:29.720 --> 40:32.800
The last six weeks
have been an absolute living nightmare...
