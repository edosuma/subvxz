WEBVTT

00:11.552 --> 00:14.549
This is 97.2 Heat FM

00:14.574 --> 00:16.561
and we have Franky Doyle

00:16.580 --> 00:18.351
- in the house.
- Whoo!

00:18.363 --> 00:21.023
Ex reality TV star, former prisoner, now

00:21.143 --> 00:23.578
the low-down is you were the big dog!

00:23.579 --> 00:25.730
Ah, the phrase is "Top Dog".

00:25.750 --> 00:30.172
Top dog, big dog, you were
the baddest bitch in there.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.040
I'm definitely getting that vibe now.

00:32.076 --> 00:33.877
Well there were badder bitches than me,

00:33.997 --> 00:36.111
and not all of them were
on my side of the bars.

00:36.174 --> 00:38.722

Oh, Boom!

00:48.930 --> 00:50.494
Thanks for that, Boom.

00:55.849 --> 00:59.193
Now you tipped a wok full of hot oil

00:59.214 --> 01:01.501
on that reality chef, Noel Saga.

01:01.526 --> 01:03.862
I hear they call him Scarface now.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.435
I'm not here to talk about that.

01:05.470 --> 01:07.774
I thought we were here to talk
about surviving on the inside.

01:07.785 --> 01:09.786
OK. If I ever go down,

01:09.813 --> 01:12.173
- what tips would you give me?
- Well, it's all about power.

01:12.418 --> 01:14.924
Whose got it and who wants it.

01:15.277 --> 01:17.695
If you got it, what
do you do to keep it?

01:18.122 --> 01:21.172
What parts of yourself will
you shut down to stay on top?

01:21.584 --> 01:23.078
And if you want it,

01:23.092 --> 01:24.691
what are you gonna do to get it?

01:24.740 --> 01:26.416
We are all strong women

01:26.625 --> 01:28.258
and we certainly don't need Bea Smith

01:28.259 --> 01:30.105
to tell us what to do
and when to do it, do we?

01:32.783 --> 01:35.492
If you had to, would you
be willing to kill someone?

01:38.054 --> 01:39.320
Here we are girls.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.875
Home sweet fuckin' home.

01:41.992 --> 01:43.549
Whooo...

01:51.612 --> 01:53.002
They're here, Governor.

02:46.579 --> 02:48.953
What a pity that this
pristine environment

02:48.979 --> 02:51.571
is about to be spoiled, by prisoners.

02:51.597 --> 02:54.163
I believe a thing is
enhanced, Mr Channing,

02:54.172 --> 02:55.971
when it gets to serve its true purpose.

02:55.996 --> 02:58.445
Well we'll know in a couple
of days whether that's true.

02:58.532 --> 02:59.941
Well ideally I need two weeks

02:59.958 --> 03:02.193
to settle the returning
prisoners back in.

03:02.210 --> 03:04.977
The board views the rebuild
as a clean slate, Vera.

03:05.097 --> 03:08.371
In two days this place will be
crawling with press and VIPs, and

03:08.396 --> 03:11.099
after the recent fiasco we
need a good news story, hmm?

03:12.297 --> 03:13.945
Don't fuck it up.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.658
- Take your time.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.730
Hey! Check out Vinegar Tits.

03:29.755 --> 03:32.169
She's got her governor
pants on.

03:32.194 --> 03:35.344
- Hey I'm back bitches!
- Jenkins...

03:35.378 --> 03:36.578
Governor...

03:36.690 --> 03:38.944
- Mr J, how's it going?
- Jenkins...

03:41.676 --> 03:43.841
Right, where's the red carpet?

03:46.457 --> 03:47.728
Hey, Doreen.

03:47.848 --> 03:49.886
- Hey you.
- Hi, Mr Jackson.

04:03.052 --> 04:04.326
Smith.

04:10.969 --> 04:13.245
Hey it's a bit bigger out here.

04:13.273 --> 04:14.941
But they could have changed the colour.

04:14.976 --> 04:18.076
Yeah, made the cells a tad
roomier and stuck in an en-suite

04:18.089 --> 04:19.254
- and a jacuzzi and...
- Fuckin' hell.

04:19.279 --> 04:20.945
Look at this, they look
like fuckin' Barbie dolls.

04:20.952 --> 04:22.522
I mean, where are the arse cracks?

04:22.547 --> 04:24.471
Oh God. Don't worry
about the arse cracks.

04:24.478 --> 04:27.507
Look at all the new programs:
we've got book club, yoga,

04:27.532 --> 04:29.745
art therapy, fitness and nutrition.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.442
- What about a choir?
- Nah, that's a shit idea, Liz.

04:32.456 --> 04:35.018
My vote's for conjugal visits
like they have at Walford.

04:35.039 --> 04:36.644
Now that is a bloody
brilliant idea, Dor,

04:36.658 --> 04:38.648
that's a brilliant idea, hey, yeah!

04:38.671 --> 04:40.827
Hey, Bea? Bea, we want conjugals, eh.

04:40.852 --> 04:42.841
Yeah, well who am I gonna conjugate?

04:42.866 --> 04:44.887
- Just conjugate yourself.
- Hey.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.414
Welcome back, Bea.

04:52.877 --> 04:54.560
Good to see you, Bea.

04:55.555 --> 04:56.762
Bea.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.361
Hasn't been the same without ya Bea.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.968
- Has it boys?
- No.

05:04.495 --> 05:05.912
Relax, Max.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.468
You might need this.

05:15.043 --> 05:17.156
Hey... Miss Miles.

05:17.181 --> 05:18.713
Did you miss us?

05:18.738 --> 05:21.064
- Thought of nothing else.
- What's chinky chunks doing here?

05:21.089 --> 05:23.804
Governor wants to mix up some of
the incumbents with the returns.

05:23.892 --> 05:25.832
- Oi you lot, clear out.
- Hey guys.

05:25.857 --> 05:27.931
Bea's gonna get us conjugals, hey!

05:27.954 --> 05:30.463
- It's cool, huh?

05:30.513 --> 05:32.363
Miss Miles, can we use the phones?

05:34.837 --> 05:36.183
Go use it now, Anderson.

05:36.208 --> 05:37.796
- Yes! I'll come with your Dor,
- Come,

05:37.821 --> 05:39.425
- we might go and check out the renos.
- let's go speak to Daddy.

05:39.450 --> 05:40.935
Let's find a jacuzzi.

05:42.406 --> 05:43.666
Bea...

05:47.839 --> 05:49.134
Fuck.

05:52.319 --> 05:53.619
Oh...

05:54.375 --> 05:56.166
Oh, you're out?

05:56.191 --> 05:58.324
Oh... obviously!

05:58.349 --> 06:00.314
- <i>... dropped the charges.</i>
- Ohhh...

06:00.339 --> 06:02.289
oh, that's great news babe.

06:02.344 --> 06:03.645
<i>How are you, you all right?</i>

06:03.693 --> 06:06.676
- Yeah, yeah, no I'm just...
- <i>The nightmare is over.</i>

06:06.701 --> 06:09.475
- I'm so happy!
- What, what, what, what?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.483
Hey, all of Nash's charges were dropped.

06:11.494 --> 06:13.408
Oh, Dor, that's unreal!

06:13.415 --> 06:15.319
- Did you hear that, darling? Daddy's
- <i>You still want me to</i>

06:15.344 --> 06:17.077
- out of jail. He is.
- <i>come for Joshy? I can come Thursday.</i>

06:17.102 --> 06:19.906
Yeah, yeah, no, I haven't changed
my mind, I just wanna know

06:19.931 --> 06:21.829
- Joshy is safe with you.
- <i>Gee, good.</i>

06:21.854 --> 06:24.141
- Yeah, we'll see you Thursday then, eh?
- <i>Yep.</i>

06:24.174 --> 06:26.545
- <i>I love you heaps, babe.</i>
- I love you too.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.552
Here. I'll put him on.

06:28.621 --> 06:29.939
Say hello to Daddy.

06:29.950 --> 06:31.335
G'day, Dad.

06:31.351 --> 06:32.899
G'day, yeah it's Josh here.

06:32.941 --> 06:36.555
I'm so excited mate about getting
out in a couple of days to see you.

06:36.778 --> 06:39.595
Hey, I'm gonna pack my bag
and put my toys in there,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.824
and steal some of Boomer's chocolates.

06:45.570 --> 06:48.617
Right, I'm gonna sign up for
fitness goals and nutrition.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.565
- Nah, I'll bet you it's full.
- Why?

06:50.592 --> 06:52.826
Yeah, cause everyone would
have heard about the conjugals

06:52.827 --> 06:54.486
- and wanted to get fit, eh?
- Yeah. Now I'll have

06:54.511 --> 06:57.046
to do yoga or creating your CV.

06:58.792 --> 07:00.038
Hey.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.919
I'm Allie Novack.

07:05.802 --> 07:07.450
Uh... Kaz wants to see ya.

07:10.315 --> 07:11.840
Bea doesn't see anyone, luv.

07:11.851 --> 07:13.102
If Kaz wants to meet,

07:13.114 --> 07:14.678
she comes to Bea, OK?

07:15.455 --> 07:16.656
OK, sure...

07:16.857 --> 07:18.158
when and where?

07:21.154 --> 07:22.933
The laundry at the changeover.

07:30.239 --> 07:32.295
Don't eat all the Cheezels, Boomer.

07:32.312 --> 07:33.579
Ahh... Too late!

07:33.618 --> 07:35.310
- Ladies.
- Hi, Mr Jackson.

07:36.070 --> 07:37.433
- Mr Jackson.
- Bea.

07:40.175 --> 07:41.488
Still here then?

07:41.701 --> 07:43.103
Glutton for punishment.

07:43.128 --> 07:44.434
Congrats on the promotion.

07:44.459 --> 07:45.659
Thank you.

07:45.705 --> 07:47.439
Hey, is Mr Fletcher still here?

07:47.470 --> 07:50.000
Uh... he uh... got out while he could.

07:50.007 --> 07:52.030
Bought a farm in Tassie,
now he's herding sheep.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.971
Oh, not much different
from his job here then.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.159
- Smith for you.
- Thank you Mr Jackson.

07:59.081 --> 08:00.751
- Governor.
- Take a seat.

08:07.062 --> 08:09.363
- It's prisoner's art therapy.

08:09.553 --> 08:10.961
Have they recovered?

08:15.513 --> 08:16.926
So how are you settling in?

08:16.959 --> 08:18.177
I trust you're comfortable?

08:18.228 --> 08:19.903
Yeah. Better than the Ritz.

08:21.785 --> 08:25.612
Look, I am going to be a
tough, but fair governor,

08:25.637 --> 08:26.851
and progressive one.

08:27.529 --> 08:30.045
I have worked bloody hard
for the last few months.

08:30.057 --> 08:32.385
I've set up great programs,
and initiatives for the women

08:32.402 --> 08:34.136
and I will see them through.

08:34.808 --> 08:36.707
But I need you to come with me.

08:37.907 --> 08:39.111
You need me?

08:39.224 --> 08:41.789
We both have similar
ambitions for the women.

08:42.907 --> 08:44.446
The new Wentworth.

08:45.510 --> 08:47.006
In two days the

08:47.031 --> 08:49.131
new parts of the building
will be officially opened,

08:49.156 --> 08:50.921
there'll be some
attention from the media.

08:50.956 --> 08:52.977
What? So this is just
to impress the press?

08:53.002 --> 08:55.122
- And that's just fluff.
- Hmmm?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.044
But those programs

08:57.094 --> 08:59.071
are not a public relations exercise,

08:59.097 --> 09:00.981
they are about genuine rehabilitation.

09:01.006 --> 09:02.206
Oh...

09:02.433 --> 09:05.031
clearly working for Kim Chang.

09:06.439 --> 09:08.014
That's exactly my point.

09:09.058 --> 09:10.996
Drugs have always found their way in.

09:11.057 --> 09:12.488
But you are the only leader

09:12.499 --> 09:14.364
who has never trafficked them. In fact,

09:14.603 --> 09:17.687
you kept the flow right
down. The women need you.

09:18.213 --> 09:20.486
What if I can't be stuffed?

09:21.526 --> 09:22.730
Well...

09:27.229 --> 09:29.921
Well that would be a shame because...

09:31.339 --> 09:34.372
there are a lot of young girls
at risk from drugs in this prison.

09:34.903 --> 09:37.526
Now, I know you don't want
to see them end up like Kim.

09:43.921 --> 09:46.013
- OK.
- Thank you.

09:46.527 --> 09:49.370
- But the women want conjugal visits.
- Oh, oh really?

09:49.889 --> 09:51.442
- Conjugal visits?
- Yeah.

09:51.459 --> 09:53.655
Well, if it's good enough
for the blokes at Walford...

09:54.708 --> 09:56.664
Well you've just finished telling
me how progressive you are.

09:56.689 --> 09:58.749
All right. In the spirit of cooperation,

09:59.252 --> 10:01.129
I will canvas that with the board

10:01.154 --> 10:02.785
if I have an assurance from you

10:02.810 --> 10:04.041
that we can work together

10:04.066 --> 10:06.374
and there will be no trouble
in front of the press.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.714
If there's any trouble,

10:09.938 --> 10:11.870
won't come from me.

10:14.909 --> 10:17.755
- What took you?
- The old Governor was on for a chat.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.171
It's time for the changeover.

10:19.210 --> 10:20.684
- Yeah?
- Come on...

10:22.767 --> 10:23.975
What?

10:24.047 --> 10:25.310
Kaz...

10:35.817 --> 10:37.185
So it's started already?

10:37.222 --> 10:39.452
- It's not like any of us actually...
- Not now, Liz!

11:05.961 --> 11:07.491
Welcome home, Bea.

11:15.786 --> 11:17.719
It's not for you, mate!

11:21.617 --> 11:23.522
Now I was pissed off with you.

11:25.147 --> 11:27.746
I thought you had betrayed
everything we stood for.

11:28.713 --> 11:31.749
But I've come to understand how
dehumanising this place can be

11:31.782 --> 11:33.731
and you're as much a
victim of it as any of us.

11:33.742 --> 11:35.758
I've told you before Kaz, I'm no victim.

11:35.759 --> 11:37.507
Neither am I. Fuck being a victim.

11:38.870 --> 11:40.623
I wanna be your friend, Bea.

11:47.644 --> 11:49.781
Even though you shopped me to the cops.

11:50.065 --> 11:51.269
Hey?

11:52.297 --> 11:53.537
Welcome home!

11:54.636 --> 11:56.256
She's back!

11:56.880 --> 11:58.612
Whoo...

12:12.426 --> 12:17.019
Courtesy of your red ride, red
whatever the fuck they call it.

12:17.043 --> 12:19.886
- No.
- Oh, I thought I'd get it passed ya.

12:19.911 --> 12:22.807
- Dor... here, to yous.
- Awww...

12:22.832 --> 12:25.752
- To no more breast feeding, luv.
- Awww, bye bye boobies.

12:25.777 --> 12:27.421
Good way to break the cloud, hey?

12:27.446 --> 12:29.758
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey...

12:30.009 --> 12:32.632
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Turn it down babe.
- Shhh!

12:32.657 --> 12:34.691
- Shhhh... You'll wake Josh!
- Shhh!

12:34.852 --> 12:36.078
Oooh...

12:36.103 --> 12:39.296
- Big bogan baby Boomer.
- Mate, be a homie, a dummy Boomer.

12:39.321 --> 12:41.363
Oh, that's OK. I might
just use your tit.

13:02.629 --> 13:03.835
Yes?

13:06.930 --> 13:08.152
What time?

13:09.742 --> 13:10.945
Thank you.

13:19.457 --> 13:21.606
So... you got the phone call?

13:21.628 --> 13:22.828
Mmmm.

13:23.013 --> 13:24.616
You can do this, Vera.

13:24.633 --> 13:25.940
All of it.

13:26.175 --> 13:29.137
About the public speaking.
I've always made a hash of that.

13:29.319 --> 13:30.599
Cue cards?

13:31.191 --> 13:32.732
Got your affirmation band?

13:34.821 --> 13:37.536
I have never put much
stock in affirmations.

13:37.570 --> 13:40.137
Trust it! OK?

13:40.747 --> 13:42.924
If it works, next bottle's on me.

13:42.949 --> 13:44.149
Done!

13:47.630 --> 13:48.837
Mmmm.

13:49.005 --> 13:50.792
On that note I better get home.

13:50.904 --> 13:52.799
Someone's got to feed the cat.

14:06.206 --> 14:08.960
Here puss, puss, puss, puss, puss...

14:10.843 --> 14:13.279
puss, puss, puss?

14:23.260 --> 14:24.817
Franky!

14:24.842 --> 14:26.711
What are you doing here?

14:27.076 --> 14:29.297
No, Frankie, we can't.

14:29.322 --> 14:30.529
Stop.

14:32.201 --> 14:33.468
Make me.

14:38.037 --> 14:39.390
You're late Gidge.

14:39.429 --> 14:40.909
I had a drink with Vera.

14:41.029 --> 14:42.852
How are the girls, they're
back? Did you see Booms?

14:42.869 --> 14:44.673
- Yeah, they're all good.
- Yeah?

14:45.109 --> 14:47.934
I heard you on the radio today.

14:49.786 --> 14:52.352
And all that talk of chick
on chick turned you on,

14:52.377 --> 14:53.736
- didn't it?
- Mm-hmmm.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.282
It's time to feed puss.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.507
Baby! Baby, baby!

15:20.532 --> 15:22.597
Shut up, Boomer, you're just pissed

15:37.310 --> 15:38.527
Bloody drunks.

15:39.476 --> 15:41.509
- They're annoying, aren't they?

15:41.906 --> 15:43.106
Eh?

15:46.312 --> 15:47.579
What's up?

15:47.585 --> 15:48.785
Oh...

15:49.328 --> 15:51.105
I don't know. I just feel...

15:53.149 --> 15:55.886
Well, I mean our time at Walford
was like a bloody holiday.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.680
You probably feel
strange being back here.

15:57.705 --> 15:59.637
- Hey?
- Yeah, I don't...

16:00.404 --> 16:01.839
No, it's not that, I...

16:02.314 --> 16:03.750
I just feel like...

16:05.397 --> 16:07.226
something bad's coming.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.094
Come and have a cuppa with me.

16:13.119 --> 16:15.770
- Nah, nah. No. You go.
- Come on.

16:16.734 --> 16:18.434

20:02.659 --> 20:03.954
You're joking?

20:04.131 --> 20:08.948
I realise it is not an ideal
situation for a whole host of reasons.

20:08.973 --> 20:12.064
Nevertheless, she's here until her trial

20:12.089 --> 20:14.571
in the new protected isolation unit.

20:14.668 --> 20:17.905
She is to have no interaction
with other prisoners

20:17.930 --> 20:19.744
and minimal contact with staff.

20:19.769 --> 20:23.203
It goes without saying I want
this kept under wraps, so if anyone

20:23.470 --> 20:26.473
has anything to say about this
matter, now is the time to raise it.

20:29.180 --> 20:30.385
OK.

20:30.756 --> 20:32.569
Nurse Radcliffe, the
contraceptive program,

20:32.594 --> 20:34.711
you are to stress its
voluntary nature to the women.

20:34.736 --> 20:36.653
- Yeah I can do that.
- Good.

20:37.050 --> 20:39.566
And that's it. Um...
Let's not forget tomorrow,

20:39.591 --> 20:42.172
VIP event. Make sure
you're all prepared for it.

20:42.197 --> 20:45.675
I want us to present Wentworth's
very best face. Thank you.

20:48.711 --> 20:51.697
It's your fault you
know? Ferguson being here.

20:51.722 --> 20:52.961
How's that?

20:53.248 --> 20:54.902
You should have let her burn.

20:59.978 --> 21:01.295
What's goin' on?

21:01.373 --> 21:04.899
The contraceptive education program
starts today. It's voluntary.

21:04.924 --> 21:07.599
What is this Nurse
Radcliffe, you want to put us

21:07.827 --> 21:09.377
on the pill?

21:09.568 --> 21:14.013
The program is to educate women
about unwanted pregnancies on release.

21:14.038 --> 21:16.082
- What do I need the pill for?
- You?

21:16.107 --> 21:18.228
Feel like I'm at a party I
shouldn't have been invited to.

21:18.254 --> 21:19.800
You can't force us on the pill.

21:19.825 --> 21:22.084
- It's voluntary.
- They can't force us.

21:22.109 --> 21:24.654
It's vo-lun-ta-ry.

21:24.679 --> 21:26.577
- What are you trying to pull here?
- I'm just the messenger.

21:26.602 --> 21:27.859
If you stop carrying on,

21:27.884 --> 21:29.923
- I'll explain the program to you.
- What's to explain?

21:29.948 --> 21:32.767
This is chemical control.
This is what this is.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.528
All right, all right, all right, all
right, eh? Everyone calm down please.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.175
What's the problem ladies?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.956
We control our own bodies. Not you.

21:40.981 --> 21:42.624
The program is voluntary, Proctor.

21:42.649 --> 21:45.764
- That's what I've been telling her.
- PMS relief, what bullshit!

21:45.789 --> 21:48.236
Well you can choose not to participate.

21:48.656 --> 21:51.448
And that's what we're doing. All of us.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.472
Come on girls, let's go.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.322
Hold on!

21:56.422 --> 21:58.548
That's not really your
choice to make, is it Kaz?

21:59.058 --> 22:02.162
I'm sure all the women here
can make up their own minds.

22:02.187 --> 22:03.392
Yeah?

22:05.901 --> 22:07.965
Why are you so keen to get
us on the pill Mr Jackson?

22:07.990 --> 22:09.700
Is there a prisoner
here you'd like to fuck

22:09.725 --> 22:11.053
- and not get pregnant?
- Yeah!

22:11.605 --> 22:13.186
Watch it, Proctor.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.616
Prisoner Ferguson.

23:14.391 --> 23:15.998
Is there anything you need?

23:19.521 --> 23:20.817
Pencil...

23:23.470 --> 23:24.810
I want to write a letter.

23:24.835 --> 23:27.011
You can't be trusted with pencils.

23:28.854 --> 23:30.345
I didn't want you here.

23:30.370 --> 23:33.425
I petitioned corrections to
have you remanded interstate.

23:33.450 --> 23:35.837
Your lawyer fought the petition. Why?

23:35.862 --> 23:37.991
I wanted to see what it looks like.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.774
The prison?

23:41.973 --> 23:44.431
That little gold crown on your shoulder.

23:45.903 --> 23:48.374
Makes you look... taller.

23:50.528 --> 23:55.117
What does feel like, Vera, to finally
have everything you've ever wanted?

23:55.784 --> 23:57.359
It's Governor.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.877
You'll be housed in this
unit until your trial.

24:01.927 --> 24:05.741
After sentencing you'll be moved to
another facility. I'll see to that.

24:06.335 --> 24:08.278
You know I'm innocent.

24:08.533 --> 24:09.987
I was set up.

24:10.163 --> 24:12.836
I saved a child's life. I'm a hero.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.011
Good luck convincing a jury.

24:16.036 --> 24:18.451
I will be exonerated.

24:19.065 --> 24:22.685
And when I am, I will be
demanding a full reinstatement.

24:22.975 --> 24:26.646
I'll be coming for
that shiny little crown.

24:28.121 --> 24:31.739
Oh, I think Mr Channing might
have something to say about that.

24:33.173 --> 24:34.611
How is Derek?

24:34.734 --> 24:39.238
He must be like a pig in mud
having a governor he can control.

24:39.411 --> 24:42.704

24:42.864 --> 24:45.621

43:58.800 --> 44:00.092
What?

44:00.116 --> 44:02.205
You are looking at the newest, baddest,

44:02.230 --> 44:04.179
paralegal bitch for Legal Relief.

44:04.203 --> 44:07.210
Ahhh... Franky that is fantastic.

44:07.481 --> 44:09.896
Aha... I wanted a bit more than that.

44:11.206 --> 44:13.021
I'm just gonna finish this report.

44:13.046 --> 44:15.265
Nuh uh. It's no time to work, Gidge.

44:15.289 --> 44:17.834
It's time to party.
Come on... come on...

44:17.859 --> 44:20.494

First time in a prison?

47:01.619 --> 47:02.877
Yeah.

47:31.065 --> 47:32.740
- Hi.
- Who are you?

47:32.765 --> 47:35.643
Enrico Pugliese. I'm uh,
Miss Spencer's junior.

47:35.668 --> 47:37.718
- Where's Nina?
- Uh, she's in court.

47:37.743 --> 47:40.943
She apologises and she
sent uh, me instead.

47:40.968 --> 47:44.140
I am paying for the best in the
business. I expect to get it.

47:47.272 --> 47:51.500
Hi Kim. Are you feeling better?

47:51.753 --> 47:54.777
You took Franky away you bitch!

47:55.029 --> 47:57.285
It's okay. We can be left alone.

47:59.729 --> 48:01.984
Ah, it's not good news.

48:02.369 --> 48:03.900
So spit it out.

48:04.312 --> 48:07.189
Well, under the rules of
disclosure the prosecution has

48:07.214 --> 48:10.265
furnished us with a
statement, from Nils Jesper.

48:10.290 --> 48:12.087
In which he denies my involvement.

48:12.112 --> 48:16.977
Uh, well, Mr Jesper has
revised his statement.

48:17.645 --> 48:19.315
He's cut a plea bargain

48:34.279 --> 48:36.590
Just go away. Fuck off!

48:36.615 --> 48:40.130
But you need to know that Franky
wanted her parole more than anything.

48:40.679 --> 48:42.557
I didn't take her away.

48:43.909 --> 48:46.364
Excuse me guard. Please guard.

49:00.086 --> 49:03.838
Trust in me, you'll never
smell of this. Stupid!

49:03.864 --> 49:07.236
What's the matter with people?
What's the matter with people?

49:16.780 --> 49:19.868
Dead men tell no tales.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.656
Yes, I have her psych evaluation
paperwork in front of me.

49:27.681 --> 49:30.855
Uh, look, this patient should not
have been discharged from the hospital.

49:31.485 --> 49:34.488
Mmmm... Can you have Dr Foster call me

49:34.513 --> 49:37.291
and in the meantime
email the clinical notes?

49:37.316 --> 49:38.525
Thank you.

49:47.050 --> 49:49.760
- Ms Westfall to see you, Governor.
- Send her in.

49:51.501 --> 49:54.238
- We need to talk about Ferguson.
- You are having a relationship

49:54.263 --> 49:55.553
with Franky Doyle.

49:55.899 --> 49:57.525
A former prisoner.

49:57.794 --> 49:59.817
You've compromised yourself
and you've compromised me.

49:59.843 --> 50:01.990
I went out on a limb
to have you reinstated.

50:04.605 --> 50:07.987
The relationship with Franky only
started when she left Wentworth.

50:08.431 --> 50:10.278
She was no longer a client.

50:12.014 --> 50:14.836
I intend to recommend to the board
that you be dismissed immediately.

50:14.837 --> 50:16.326
In the meantime, you should go home.

50:18.377 --> 50:21.475
- I know you feel this is a personal...
- Do not tell me how I feel!

50:25.959 --> 50:27.166
Okay.

50:28.993 --> 50:30.201
You're right.

50:31.653 --> 50:32.861
I deserve that.

50:34.067 --> 50:35.275
One more thing...

50:35.947 --> 50:37.767
If Doyle is living with you...

50:38.601 --> 50:40.815
that would constitute
a breach of her parole.

50:51.499 --> 50:52.939
You're in the wrong place.

50:52.964 --> 50:54.840
Give it a rest, Kaz.

50:54.841 --> 50:56.901
Shouldn't you have stayed
in the men's prison?

50:57.083 --> 51:00.959
Yeah blokes, red right
hand. Not perfect together.

51:00.984 --> 51:03.005
She said give it a rest.

51:05.214 --> 51:06.882
Didn't think you'd be too far away.

51:08.149 --> 51:11.616
Ooh, while you're here. You know, if
you want to start something, anything...

51:11.657 --> 51:13.468
you run it by me first, okay?

51:13.494 --> 51:15.955
Sure. Got it Bea.

51:16.290 --> 51:17.980
Check with the boss.

51:18.351 --> 51:20.323
Where's my toothpaste?

51:22.330 --> 51:24.178
Allie's got the hots for you.

51:24.587 --> 51:26.545
Ugh. She's just weird.

51:26.586 --> 51:28.590
Well, that's the vibe I'm pickin' up.

51:29.477 --> 51:30.974
You should use it to your advantage Bea.

51:30.999 --> 51:33.702
- Bea. I'm serious.
- Hey Bea! Hey! Bea!

51:34.605 --> 51:36.704
Hey do you know anything
about the conjugals yet?

51:36.729 --> 51:38.058
- Yeah.
- I've been in the shower,

51:38.084 --> 51:40.259
not gazing into a crystal ball.

51:40.490 --> 51:43.343
Oh, well, could you like
ask the Governor again?

51:43.368 --> 51:45.501
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I'm gettin' desperate.

51:45.527 --> 51:47.875
- Getting?
- Everyone's so excited, eh?

51:47.900 --> 51:50.132
Yeah, they are.

51:50.157 --> 51:51.517
Good on ya, Bea.

52:08.001 --> 52:09.794
How would Vera know that?

52:10.055 --> 52:11.864
How would she know anything about us?

52:11.889 --> 52:14.571
I don't know. It seemed pointless
to ask her how she found out.

52:14.597 --> 52:17.611
It's The Freak winding her up.
She's just trying to bluff ya.

52:17.816 --> 52:19.326
You gotta deny everything.

52:19.696 --> 52:22.415
And what's she going to tell them
anyway? The Freak can smell me?

52:22.440 --> 52:25.128
- Franky, listen.
- What is she, a fuckin' beagle?

52:25.153 --> 52:26.360
It's not a bluff.

52:26.984 --> 52:29.782
All right? And I don't want
you getting caught up in this.

52:30.255 --> 52:31.464
What do ya mean?

52:31.815 --> 52:34.265
You gotta pack your stuff
and get back to the bedsit.

52:34.290 --> 52:36.119
- Now.
- You kickin' me out?

52:36.120 --> 52:38.818
If Vera reports you
to your parole officer

52:38.834 --> 52:40.398
and you're not living where
you said you were living

52:40.423 --> 52:41.462
they're going to ship you straight

52:41.487 --> 52:43.067
- back there.
- And I will fuckin' kill her.

52:43.093 --> 52:44.743
- Franky.
- No. Fuck that, Gidge.

52:44.768 --> 52:47.048
I've fought hard for this and you know.

52:47.701 --> 52:49.707
For the first time I've got a life.

52:49.733 --> 52:52.634
And I've got a girl and
I'm about to start a job.

52:52.697 --> 52:54.534
You've done great, baby.

52:55.262 --> 52:58.369
I'm proud of you but we need to
focus on the practicalities...

52:58.394 --> 53:00.320
Why? And let that vindictive
shit take it all away?

53:00.345 --> 53:02.516
It's not just about you Franky.

53:02.517 --> 53:04.245
She thought I was a friend.

53:05.727 --> 53:07.137
You're defending her.

53:08.127 --> 53:09.490
It's my fault.

53:09.992 --> 53:11.467
I fucked everything up.

53:17.476 --> 53:20.824
Fine. I'm outta here.

53:30.216 --> 53:32.073
Hey... Franky.

53:33.685 --> 53:35.149
What the fuck?

53:35.856 --> 53:37.469
Franky. I need to talk to ya.

53:37.495 --> 53:39.405
Oh yeah, it's great timing Dad.

53:39.431 --> 53:41.200
Hey look. I understand,
all right, I understand.

53:41.226 --> 53:43.761
But look, if-if I could
just give you my number and

53:43.786 --> 53:46.781
when you're ready you can
just give me a call, please.

54:02.082 --> 54:04.475
So what's, ah, happening
with the conjugal visits.

54:04.501 --> 54:06.246
There will be no conjugal visits.

54:06.561 --> 54:07.860
But you said you'd look into it.

54:07.885 --> 54:09.899
And you said there'd be no
trouble at the press event.

54:09.924 --> 54:11.486
I didn't start that trouble.

54:13.128 --> 54:15.599
- Did you even ask Channing?
- Yes.

54:15.811 --> 54:19.879
There is no conjugal visit program
in any women's prisons, because the

54:19.905 --> 54:22.488
department can't afford the pregnancy
and birth related health costs.

54:22.513 --> 54:24.191
Not everyone wants to get pregnant.

54:24.216 --> 54:26.183
It is the perfect antidote for boredom.

54:26.209 --> 54:28.735
They'd be popping them
out like ping pong balls.

54:30.198 --> 54:31.877
According to Mr Channing.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.982
One thing it's safe to say. The women
are going to be pretty pissed off.

54:35.212 --> 54:38.935
Uh, I want you to get involved in
one of the new education programs.

54:38.951 --> 54:40.655
Grooming for Success.

54:43.311 --> 54:44.886
Grooming for Suc...?

54:44.911 --> 54:46.544
Me?

54:46.657 --> 54:47.865
A lifer?

54:47.890 --> 54:49.640
You can teach the women
what you're good at.

54:49.648 --> 54:52.115
What? Murder? Hm?

54:52.141 --> 54:53.428
And hairdressing!

54:55.002 --> 54:56.813
I need to keep the women active.

54:58.528 --> 54:59.803
Excuse me, Governor.

54:59.828 --> 55:01.137
Thank you, Smith.

55:06.628 --> 55:08.509
The Freak is asking to...

55:08.982 --> 55:10.814
Ferguson is asking to see you.

55:21.257 --> 55:22.777
You wanted to see me?

55:22.803 --> 55:26.120
Not particularly, no. It's
Mr Channing I'd like to see.

55:27.036 --> 55:28.657
Mr Channing's not here.

55:28.861 --> 55:30.206
But he will be tomorrow.

55:30.232 --> 55:32.926
When he arrives could you
convey my request for a meeting?

55:34.159 --> 55:35.990
You're a prisoner now.

55:36.292 --> 55:39.457
You don't get to have meetings
with the regional director.

55:39.607 --> 55:40.815
Really?

55:47.219 --> 55:49.077
How's little Joshy going at home?

55:49.100 --> 55:52.225
Well, Nash says he's doing fine
but I'm missing him like crazy.

55:52.251 --> 55:54.058
- Course you are.
- Hey. How did it go?

55:54.090 --> 55:55.869
We get the rumpy pumpy time?

55:56.263 --> 55:58.570
All right. Listen up ladies.

55:59.355 --> 56:00.706
Uh...

56:01.065 --> 56:04.361
I'm sorry, but the uh, department
said no to conjugal visits.

56:04.387 --> 56:06.759
- <i>That's bullshit!</i>
- Oh, jeez.

56:06.784 --> 56:08.488
- <i>Why?</i>
- I tried my best.

56:08.489 --> 56:10.924
Well, why didn't Vinegar
Tits fight harder for us?

56:10.949 --> 56:12.194
- Yeah!
- I don't know.

56:12.219 --> 56:15.944
Maybe she didn't appreciate
being pelted with dirty tampons.

56:17.104 --> 56:20.662
Come on. Seriously. We don't
have to put up with this.

56:20.686 --> 56:24.125
If the men at Walford can get
conjugal visits, then so can we.

56:24.300 --> 56:26.339
Some of us might take no for an answer

56:26.364 --> 56:28.936
but I don't and I won't.
Hands up, who wants a root?

56:28.961 --> 56:30.942
<i>- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!</i>

56:30.967 --> 56:32.620
<i>- Yeah!
- Ah-ha!</i>

56:33.212 --> 56:34.422
Give me the phone.

56:36.209 --> 56:38.352
I don't think she gets
the whole "Top Dog" thing.

56:38.377 --> 56:40.411
Oh, just full of hot air.

56:40.436 --> 56:42.412
She is politically savvy.

56:42.437 --> 56:44.532
She knows how to harness their emotions.

56:44.557 --> 56:45.863
Don't worry Maxine.

56:46.109 --> 56:47.433
I can manage her.

56:48.577 --> 56:50.524
- Can I have that?
- Yeah, it's nice.

56:50.549 --> 56:51.786
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

56:52.125 --> 56:54.880
<i>I was thinking tomorrow
morning 10:00. Can you do that?</i>

56:55.455 --> 56:57.381
- Good.

57:00.455 --> 57:02.028
- Bury that.

57:04.446 --> 57:06.245
They are not gonna know what hit 'em.

57:27.610 --> 57:29.624
<i>You treated that girl
like a piece of meat.</i>

57:29.649 --> 57:31.584
<i>I love you Franky.</i>

57:31.601 --> 57:33.410
<i>The only way I'm getting
out of here is in a box.</i>

57:33.434 --> 57:35.943
<i>I suppose you can't help
but self-destruct can you?</i>

57:35.959 --> 57:37.548
<i>You're not that person Franky.</i>

57:37.573 --> 57:38.963
<i>I'm whatever person I need to be.</i>

57:38.987 --> 57:40.921
<i>Please Franky. Please don't go...</i>

57:45.482 --> 57:46.863
All right.

57:47.534 --> 57:48.966
You got my attention.

57:51.623 --> 57:53.347
Don't tell me you're missing this place.

57:53.363 --> 57:55.723
Ugh... what do you reckon?

57:56.579 --> 57:57.787
What are you doing here?

57:59.032 --> 58:00.241
Don't know.

58:00.754 --> 58:02.092
That's the truth.

58:04.130 --> 58:06.288
Hope you're respecting
your freedom, Franky...

58:06.809 --> 58:08.121
you should be.

58:08.768 --> 58:11.145
Yeah. Well, I don't want to
come back here that's for sure.

01:07:35.056 --> 01:07:36.887

01:07:36.917 --> 01:07:38.370
Not necessarily.

01:08:11.498 --> 01:08:15.201

01:08:16.868 --> 01:08:19.649
Some things to consider
for my move into general.

01:08:20.609 --> 01:08:22.053
I don't do laundry.

01:08:22.078 --> 01:08:24.281
My preference would be to be
assigned to the kitchen where I can

01:08:24.305 --> 01:08:25.654
prepare my own meals.

01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:27.643
Also I suggest housing me
in a unit with the new

01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:29.849
prisoners. It will reduce the
likelihood of prejudice.

01:08:29.881 --> 01:08:31.227
Are you listening Vera?

01:08:32.758 --> 01:08:33.965

much bigger problem to discuss.

01:09:26.991 --> 01:09:28.716

Well, I'm wondering
what her motivation is.

01:09:36.322 --> 01:09:38.295
I mean if Bea doesn't kill
her, someone else will.

01:09:38.296 --> 01:09:40.520
That's too easy. I want
Ferguson to face justice.

01:09:40.546 --> 01:09:42.493
She dies on my watch, she wins.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.027
The safest thing for all concerned
is to get her out of Wentworth

01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:46.684

- Yeah, but she,

01:09:48.406 --> 01:09:50.401

grounds to hold her there.

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:55.681
Oh. I got a lasagne in the oven. Um...

01:09:57.395 --> 01:09:58.851
would you like some dinner?

01:10:00.188 --> 01:10:02.248
Oh, but we could continue
our conversation. Yes,

01:10:02.273 --> 01:10:03.550
- Yeah.
- Yep.

01:10:05.469 --> 01:10:06.875
Gidge. Open up.

01:10:08.392 --> 01:10:09.601
It's Doyle.

01:10:11.187 --> 01:10:13.733
- Ummm...
- <i>She was at Wentworth last night.</i>

01:10:14.445 --> 01:10:16.777
- What was she doing there?
- Well, I don't know.

01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:18.912
One of the officers saw
her in the car park.

01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:21.869
<i>Come on. I don't have my key.</i>

01:10:21.896 --> 01:10:23.745
- I'll handle it.
- Mmm.

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:29.291
What? You're not letting
me in the house?

01:10:29.316 --> 01:10:31.919
Well, there's someone in here.

01:10:34.508 --> 01:10:36.112
<i>Where the hell have you been?</i>

01:10:36.797 --> 01:10:39.124
And what's with not having
your phone on for 24 hours?

01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:40.681
I needed time to think.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:42.138
Is that all you were doing?

01:10:42.139 --> 01:10:43.348
Yeah.

01:10:44.392 --> 01:10:45.686
What? You don't believe me?

01:10:45.711 --> 01:10:47.510
I know you were at Wentworth.

01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:49.903
That is outstanding.

01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:51.937
Why?

01:10:53.514 --> 01:10:55.244
I mean that's what I came to tell ya.

01:10:58.346 --> 01:10:59.648
It's not easy...

01:11:00.612 --> 01:11:03.551
after being inside, to know
how to be on the outside.

01:11:04.584 --> 01:11:06.592
And I love being free.

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:09.290
But it scares the fuck out of me.

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:12.485
And sometimes like last night...

01:11:12.504 --> 01:11:15.793
I feel like it's all gonna get ripped
away, like it's not really mine.

01:11:18.043 --> 01:11:21.163
You know, everything
seemed clearer in prison.

01:11:22.349 --> 01:11:25.079
And the thought of that was
somehow comforting. So, I went back.

01:11:26.736 --> 01:11:28.075
Did it help?

01:11:30.891 --> 01:11:32.524
Acknowledging the fear.

01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:34.691
Isn't that what you say?

01:11:36.823 --> 01:11:38.862
So, I just wanted to tell ya...

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.831
Thank you.

01:12:02.898 --> 01:12:04.102
Mmmm...

01:12:09.639 --> 01:12:11.200
Would you pass the salad?

01:12:15.577 --> 01:12:16.850
Oh, and the pepper.

01:12:24.903 --> 01:12:26.308
So you got duck eggs?

01:12:27.249 --> 01:12:29.761
It's gotta be something The
Freak wants, that's worth the risk.

01:12:29.777 --> 01:12:31.100
Or she has a death wish.

01:12:31.487 --> 01:12:33.188
Psychopath's aren't suicidal.

01:12:33.855 --> 01:12:35.912
They thrive on power.

01:12:36.374 --> 01:12:38.405
Yeah but she's got no
power and protection.

01:12:38.429 --> 01:12:39.899
There's no one she can manipulate.

01:12:41.081 --> 01:12:43.639
Oh-ho-ho-ho... fuck!

01:12:46.103 --> 01:12:47.585
She wants to be Top Dog.

01:12:50.326 --> 01:12:51.670
Watch out Red.

01:12:57.626 --> 01:12:59.934
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

01:13:00.474 --> 01:13:02.761
Hey, give me a sec.

01:13:06.557 --> 01:13:07.837
Hey Ellie.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:09.971
Hey. Come here.

01:13:10.642 --> 01:13:11.846
Come on.

01:13:11.995 --> 01:13:14.180
What the fuck? Why?

01:13:14.205 --> 01:13:16.062
Does it matter why? Fuck off.

01:13:17.637 --> 01:13:18.841
Yuck!

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.704
Right-o.

01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:24.431
Hey, Kaz out of medical yet?

01:13:24.763 --> 01:13:25.966
Yeah.

01:13:25.991 --> 01:13:28.427
Yeah, she's fine now. No
fracture, just a bruise.

01:13:28.452 --> 01:13:29.806
Oh. That's good.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.917
Hey I like that colour.

01:13:35.587 --> 01:13:37.577
I reckon you'd look better lighter.

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:40.256
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

01:13:40.724 --> 01:13:42.850
I could do it for you.
Give you a cut and colour.

01:13:44.826 --> 01:13:46.029
All right.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.647
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:14:12.566 --> 01:14:14.632
- You stalkin' me now, are ya?
- No, Franky.

01:14:14.665 --> 01:14:16.320
Look. I know you don't
want anything to do with me.

01:14:16.345 --> 01:14:17.794
Yeah. That's why I didn't call ya.

01:14:18.051 --> 01:14:19.318
You got a sister.

01:14:26.224 --> 01:14:27.527
So when did this happen?

01:14:27.952 --> 01:14:29.438
She's three years old.

01:14:30.337 --> 01:14:32.574
I thought you had the
right to know each other.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.840
At least know each other exist.

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:45.634
Dr Foster sent over Ferguson's
psychopathy checklist.

01:14:45.659 --> 01:14:48.427
I knew she'd manipulated those answers.

01:14:48.453 --> 01:14:51.329
Be careful. You're
poking a dangerous spider.

01:14:52.095 --> 01:14:54.449
You want her to go back into
the psych hospital, don't you?

01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:56.088
Yes. But not at any cost.

01:15:04.966 --> 01:15:06.440
How are you today Joan?

01:15:08.493 --> 01:15:10.678
I'll feel better when
I move into general.

01:15:10.702 --> 01:15:12.389
Yes. That's what I'm here to discuss.

01:15:12.413 --> 01:15:16.054
The Governor has asked me to
assess your readiness for general...

01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:18.637
from a psychological viewpoint.

01:15:18.844 --> 01:15:20.050
Obviously.

01:15:21.695 --> 01:15:23.856
I understand it must be
quite boring here for you.

01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:28.188
It's an isolation unit. There
is no stimulation whatsoever.

01:15:28.213 --> 01:15:33.406
You're not... concerned about
the risk to yourself, physically,

01:15:33.431 --> 01:15:34.928
from the other prisoners in general?

01:15:34.952 --> 01:15:36.159
Not at all.

01:15:36.679 --> 01:15:38.030
And why is that?

01:15:39.412 --> 01:15:41.090
It's not obvious to you?

01:15:42.912 --> 01:15:44.454
Because you're superior?

01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:52.834
Yes...

01:16:01.232 --> 01:16:03.398
You're not assessing, you're scoring.

01:16:04.146 --> 01:16:06.012
Oh, it's all part of it I'm afraid Joan.

01:16:06.781 --> 01:16:08.398
- Can we continue?
- Tell you what.

01:16:08.423 --> 01:16:12.393
You ask me a question
and then I'll ask you one.

01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:13.944
Quid pro quo.

01:16:14.099 --> 01:16:15.739
You know that's not how it works Joan.

01:16:15.764 --> 01:16:17.972
I'll start. You had
some free moves already.

01:16:18.427 --> 01:16:20.187
What was your favourite childhood game?

01:16:23.891 --> 01:16:25.194
All right...

01:16:25.699 --> 01:16:28.300
Is there anything you've
never told your parents?

01:16:29.796 --> 01:16:31.649
Have you ever been raped?

01:16:35.249 --> 01:16:37.278
I'm not answering any of your questions.

01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:38.510
You just did.

01:16:41.072 --> 01:16:44.567
Now I understand your reluctance to
play. It's a bit close to the bone.

01:16:46.058 --> 01:16:49.521
What if I ask you about somebody else?

01:16:49.628 --> 01:16:51.152
Vera for example?

01:16:51.544 --> 01:16:53.254
What's your opinion of her?

01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:57.351
Really, your professional opinion?

01:16:57.572 --> 01:17:00.634
Miss Bennett is an
extremely capable Governor.

01:17:00.672 --> 01:17:03.485
The media love her and
she is respected by all.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.206
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

01:17:08.198 --> 01:17:10.139
You know as well as I do she's weak.

01:17:11.039 --> 01:17:13.498
She's a pathetic little creature.
She would have languished

01:17:13.523 --> 01:17:15.214
upstairs forever as a shitkicker

01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:17.096
- had I not mentored her.
- Right.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:22.009
You'll be fascinated to know
that her only act of courage...

01:17:22.033 --> 01:17:24.368
was to euthanise her own mother.

01:17:28.379 --> 01:17:30.155
You truly are a cunt.

01:17:31.245 --> 01:17:32.528
Thank you.

01:17:35.521 --> 01:17:37.765
Of course none of this
recording will be any use to you.

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:39.988
<i>You are recording it.</i>

01:17:51.379 --> 01:17:54.455
She memorised indicators.
She recognised keywords.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.338
She knew exactly what I was doing.

01:18:00.103 --> 01:18:01.781
We can't use that recording.

01:18:04.144 --> 01:18:05.353
No.

01:18:08.296 --> 01:18:09.781
You wanted to see Smith, Governor?

01:18:09.806 --> 01:18:11.847
- Send her in.
- I'll leave you to it.

01:18:19.049 --> 01:18:20.796
A heads up and a request.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:22.501
Hey, well, you give me the heads up

01:18:22.526 --> 01:18:24.877
and I'll see what I can
do about that request.

01:18:27.342 --> 01:18:31.745
It is possible that Ferguson will be
released into the general population.

01:18:34.074 --> 01:18:35.361
Are you kidding?

01:18:35.747 --> 01:18:38.201
It's out of my hands. The
board is making this decision.

01:18:42.526 --> 01:18:43.849
And the request?

01:18:43.876 --> 01:18:48.401
If she is released. I need an
undertaking she won't be harmed.

01:18:49.435 --> 01:18:50.642
Okay, sure.

01:18:51.926 --> 01:18:54.322
Maybe I'll just pull a
magic wand out of my arse.

01:18:54.323 --> 01:18:57.162
If anything happens to
Ferguson, I'll lose my job.

01:18:57.188 --> 01:18:59.586
Ha. Surely it'd be worth it?

01:19:00.981 --> 01:19:03.473
Now, I know Ferguson made
your life hell, Smith,

01:19:04.231 --> 01:19:05.850
and maybe it's too
early for you to tell,

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:07.329
but I'm a very different governor.

01:19:07.337 --> 01:19:10.044
So I'm just supposed
to trust you then? Hmm?

01:19:10.157 --> 01:19:11.646
I'm supposed to help you?

01:19:12.879 --> 01:19:15.009
The women have embraced my new programs.

01:19:16.286 --> 01:19:18.031
I can just as easily take them away.

01:19:27.718 --> 01:19:29.854
What the women want
more than anything...

01:19:30.281 --> 01:19:31.822
is the conjugal visits.

01:19:34.104 --> 01:19:36.304
So do you think you can
find that magic wand?

01:19:37.325 --> 01:19:38.658
The Freak?

01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:40.939
Well, I give her one week max.

01:19:40.965 --> 01:19:43.057
Fuck that. Won't take a week to do it.

01:19:43.073 --> 01:19:45.523
Hey! No one's going
to be doing anything.

01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:47.662
I made a deal with the Governor.

01:19:47.757 --> 01:19:50.577
Ooh, must be some deal to stop
you from takin' out The Freak, hey?

01:19:50.602 --> 01:19:52.448
- Yeah.
- I reckon you're gonna be pretty happy.

01:19:52.473 --> 01:19:54.225
Well, are you going to
tell us what the deal is?

01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:55.461
Yeah.

01:19:55.485 --> 01:19:56.692
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:19:56.717 --> 01:20:00.418
Well, I could but... I'll
let her tell you herself.

01:20:00.831 --> 01:20:02.837
I have a brief announcement.

01:20:02.863 --> 01:20:04.766
You've sent The Freak to Africa?

01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:07.334
- Oh, yeah!

01:20:07.359 --> 01:20:09.466
Hear the Governor out.

01:20:09.491 --> 01:20:10.700
Thank you.

01:20:11.576 --> 01:20:14.569
After a proposal from Bea Smith,

01:20:14.593 --> 01:20:17.260
on behalf of the women I can tell you...

01:20:17.936 --> 01:20:19.831
that on a trial basis...

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.677
we will be instituting conjugal visits.

01:20:22.702 --> 01:20:23.907
Ooooh...

01:20:23.932 --> 01:20:26.725
- <i>Let's go ladies!</i>

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.538
- Boom!
- <i>Take a seat!</i>

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.797
<i>- Fuck, yeah!
- Tale a seat!</i>

01:20:31.821 --> 01:20:36.232
We are the first women's
prison in the country to do so.

01:20:38.359 --> 01:20:40.163
Okay, there is a proviso,

01:20:40.567 --> 01:20:44.512
suggested by Smith and agreed
to by the Corrections Service.

01:20:45.019 --> 01:20:47.454
Those of you who wish to participate...

01:20:47.788 --> 01:20:51.797
must also take part in the contraception
and family planning program.

01:20:52.141 --> 01:20:54.734
- <i>Well done, Bea! Woo hoo!</i>
- Huh, what?

01:20:54.758 --> 01:20:56.433
<i>- Good work, Bea.
- Thanks, Bea.</i>

01:20:56.458 --> 01:20:58.358
<i>You fuckin' little ripper, Bea.</i>

01:20:58.383 --> 01:21:01.645
Okay and, um, one more thing
I'd like to let you know about

01:21:01.670 --> 01:21:05.354
in addition to the other programs I've
introduced, there is a new one starting

01:21:05.721 --> 01:21:08.076
Personal Grooming and Presentation.

01:21:08.185 --> 01:21:11.426
The, uh, hairdressing component
will be run by Bea Smith.

01:21:11.451 --> 01:21:13.276
Oh, fuck yeah, fuck yeah!

01:21:20.565 --> 01:21:22.140
I can't believe you talked me into this.

01:21:22.165 --> 01:21:24.386
It is an insurance
policy until Ferguson's

01:21:24.411 --> 01:21:26.314
trial, if she gets
released into general.

01:21:26.339 --> 01:21:27.825
I doubt it will last the trial period.

01:21:27.851 --> 01:21:29.954
You promised the board, if
you were appointed Governor,

01:21:29.979 --> 01:21:31.706
things would run
smoother. And I backed you.

01:21:31.723 --> 01:21:33.655
That was before they
sabotaged my efforts

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.894
by considering Ferguson's
insane petition.

01:21:35.919 --> 01:21:37.244
Just take control...

01:21:37.362 --> 01:21:38.601
Jesus!

01:21:49.807 --> 01:21:51.197
What the fuck.

01:21:58.176 --> 01:21:59.824
What sort of prison
are you running here?

01:21:59.825 --> 01:22:02.035
That was a threat. We
can't take it lightly.

01:22:02.036 --> 01:22:03.420
Tell the board what you witnessed.

01:22:03.421 --> 01:22:05.955
What? That you can't
control your prisoners.

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:09.821
This transfer is not my doing. You
have to tell Ferguson it can't happen.

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:11.837
Fuck Vera.

01:22:12.768 --> 01:22:15.439
I want to stay as far away
as possible from that bitch.

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:17.534
It is up to you to
close this can of worms

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:19.550
otherwise we will have
a death on our hands.

01:22:21.947 --> 01:22:23.936
Those newbies are gonna
freak when they realise

01:22:23.961 --> 01:22:26.102
it's me showing them how
to apply make-up. (laughs)

01:22:26.127 --> 01:22:28.404
How's Vinegar Tits, cheeky bitch.

01:22:29.305 --> 01:22:30.907
Is there a wig in that box?

01:22:31.982 --> 01:22:33.238
Uhh... it's empty.

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:35.803
God, if it's not bloody
nailed down in this place.

01:22:35.828 --> 01:22:37.029
Hey...

01:22:37.055 --> 01:22:38.544
Bea look who's here.

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.248
I'll have a cut and colour, thanks.

01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:47.691
Step into my salon.

01:22:49.851 --> 01:22:52.178
Push me higher, Daddy!

01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:57.740

Look at this hon... it's
your big sister, Jess.

01:23:47.337 --> 01:23:48.541
Hi.

01:23:48.579 --> 01:23:50.714
That's your sister. It's Franky.

01:24:02.902 --> 01:24:04.485
It's nice to meet you.

01:24:12.519 --> 01:24:13.730
Just so you know...

01:24:13.755 --> 01:24:17.017
I am not going to pursue that
matter between you and Doyle.

01:24:18.336 --> 01:24:20.736
Ooh. Can I ask why?

01:24:20.884 --> 01:24:22.570
It's purely pragmatic.

01:24:24.534 --> 01:24:27.114
Your job is secure, as
long as I'm Governor.

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:28.842
However long that might be.

01:24:28.868 --> 01:24:31.225
Well, I'm grateful.

01:24:31.695 --> 01:24:33.044
For Franky too.

01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:36.194
Uh, Bridget?

01:24:36.219 --> 01:24:37.423
Hmm?

01:24:38.528 --> 01:24:41.070
Those things that Ferguson
had said about me...

01:24:41.485 --> 01:24:44.819
- Don't give them another thought.
- No, uh, I wanted to ask...

01:24:46.982 --> 01:24:49.166
you don't think that
I'm in any way like her?

01:24:52.295 --> 01:24:56.931
The very fact that you can even
ask that question means you're not.

01:24:58.542 --> 01:25:00.477
Psychopaths have no fear.

01:25:02.667 --> 01:25:03.947
Night, Vera.

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:05.665
Night.

01:25:13.825 --> 01:25:16.484
- Hey, spunky.
- Hey, baby.

01:25:21.682 --> 01:25:23.540
- Hey.
- Heya.

01:25:23.564 --> 01:25:25.091
Thanks for picking me up.

01:25:25.112 --> 01:25:27.417
No sweat. I wanted to.

01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:30.885
It's not weird for you, being here?

01:25:31.007 --> 01:25:33.234
Well, it's no weirder
than the rest of my life.

01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:36.892
You okay?

01:25:36.916 --> 01:25:38.117
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:25:40.798 --> 01:25:43.351
Just got... I just got
some stuff I gotta sort out.

01:25:46.057 --> 01:25:47.694
We're not breaking up are we?

01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:49.368
No, defs not.

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:51.487
Phew, you had me worried
there for a minute.

01:25:55.255 --> 01:25:56.601
I should move out.

01:25:57.892 --> 01:25:59.360
I have to, Gidge.

01:26:01.563 --> 01:26:04.114
If I'm ever gonna learn how
to live on the outside...

01:26:04.901 --> 01:26:07.000
I need to be able to
stand on my own two feet.

01:26:09.746 --> 01:26:11.314
Sounds like a breakthrough.

01:26:16.222 --> 01:26:17.420
Mmmm.

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.556
What took you so long?

01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:37.583
I've been giving your
petition due consideration.

01:26:39.138 --> 01:26:41.095
And I'll be recommending to the board...

01:26:41.226 --> 01:26:43.992
not to release you
into general population.

01:26:45.166 --> 01:26:46.762
Surely my lawyer's been in touch?

01:26:46.788 --> 01:26:49.199
Mm-hmm. And you can
tell her to stop calling

01:26:49.691 --> 01:26:51.215
because it's not going to happen.

01:26:52.686 --> 01:26:54.722
You seem to have forgotten how

01:26:54.748 --> 01:26:58.727
assiduously I have protected your
interests over the past months.

01:26:59.971 --> 01:27:02.089
- Joan...
- Derrick.

01:27:02.112 --> 01:27:04.528
whatever you think you have
over me you can forget it.

01:27:04.934 --> 01:27:07.345
You have discredited
yourself as a witness,

01:27:07.533 --> 01:27:08.964
and in the meantime...

01:27:09.617 --> 01:27:10.919
I've cleaned house.

01:27:12.101 --> 01:27:14.578
If anyone was to investigate
me they'd find nothing.

01:27:16.193 --> 01:27:18.445
You know, Derrick, you may
think you've cleaned house,

01:27:19.595 --> 01:27:23.185
you may think you have tied
up every loose end, but...

01:27:25.542 --> 01:27:26.847
you haven't.

01:27:29.504 --> 01:27:30.898
You wanna test it?

01:27:35.999 --> 01:27:37.994
Release Ferguson into general.

01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:39.915
Give her what she wants.

01:27:39.939 --> 01:27:43.562
You saw what the prisoners did.
She won't survive 5 minutes.

01:27:44.452 --> 01:27:46.048
Let's hope it's not that long.
