WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:05.522
You lied to me again.
You decide to trick me

00:05.680 --> 00:08.923
into being possessed
by some psycho-angel?

00:09.080 --> 00:11.686
- And now...
- Kevin's blood is on my hands.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.411
But I'll find Gadreel
and I will end that son of a bitch.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.449
- But I'll do it alone.
- What's that supposed to mean?

00:16.600 --> 00:19.490
Sam, people get close to me,
they get killed, or worse.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.803
Just go.
I'm not gonna stop you.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.120
It's the bloody Mark of Cain.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.440
The Mark and the Blade work together.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.364
I can give you the Mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.640
The Mark can be transferred.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.609
Called a friend of ours.
Garth.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.609
He does what we do,
in his own way.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.370
Stop being an idiot.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.601
And you know
what's coming next, right?

00:36.680 --> 00:37.806
Man, this is good.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.041
Oh, Marmaduke, you're crazy!

00:42.160 --> 00:43.844
- Hey, where's Garth?
- On a case.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.684
With the dentist. I don't know.
I haven't heard from him.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.126
Garth still MIA?

01:07.720 --> 01:10.246
Hey!

01:53.200 --> 01:54.440
Good afternoon.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.524
I'm looking for a John Doe that was
admitted here a few days ago.

01:57.720 --> 02:02.965
He's a skinny,
Ichabod Crane-looking kind of guy.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.805
Know just who you mean.
Room 113, Agent.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.200
Great, thanks.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.727
He sure is a popular fella.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.968
Saw Garth's John Doe
on the police wire.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.565
You?

02:37.760 --> 02:38.761
Yeah.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.721
- Where you coming from?
- New Mexico.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.807
Well, that's a haul.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.609
Especially considering that
I got this pretty much covered.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.091
So, if you wanna...

02:51.240 --> 02:52.924
You spoken to him, yet?

02:54.440 --> 02:55.441
No.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.607
Ass-load of painkillers.
He's been out, since I got here.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.160
What's he being charged with?

03:02.920 --> 03:06.163
- Killing a cow.
- Why?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.368
I was about to see
if I could find out.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.404
Lock the door.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.290
Whoa, hey,
what is that, adrenaline?

03:17.440 --> 03:18.566
Yes, sir.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.520
Are you trying
to jump-start him or kill him?

03:20.600 --> 03:24.047
I want some answers. He walked out
on Kevin, he walked out on us.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.486
So, if you got a better idea...

03:37.040 --> 03:39.407
Dean?
Sam?

03:41.040 --> 03:43.407
What is this, a hospital?

03:43.560 --> 03:45.642
Wait.
Am I in Heaven?

03:45.800 --> 03:48.087
All right, take it easy, Garth.
You're in Wisconsin.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.642
You were hit by car.
Do you remember anything?

03:54.160 --> 03:55.491
Vaguely.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.165
What's with the hardware?

03:59.320 --> 04:00.446
You tell us.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.409
And while you're at it,
why don't you give us a low-down

04:02.560 --> 04:04.440
on where you went AWOL,
for the past six months.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.691
The only way we tracked you down
was that you offed a cow.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.923
Offed a what?

04:11.080 --> 04:13.003
L...l was on a hunt.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.491
Hunt for what?

04:17.160 --> 04:19.128
Oh, no.
Oh, get back.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.521
Oh, God.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.208
Good thing I didn't
give him the adrenaline.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.529
Anything on Gadreel?

04:38.680 --> 04:41.411
Actually, yeah.
Turns out, he...

04:41.560 --> 04:43.927
He left some grace in me,
before he bolted.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.649
You know how wrong
that sounds, right?

04:49.200 --> 04:51.282
I wouldn't worry about it,
Cass took care of it.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.284
- Hmm.
- What?

04:56.680 --> 04:58.250
Nothing.
I'm gone for two weeks

04:58.400 --> 05:00.482
and you're like an episode
of Teen Mom.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.169
Just breathe, Garth.
Work it out.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.521
What happened to your arm?

05:15.680 --> 05:20.971
Oh... That's a...
A gift from Cain.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.129
Like... the wrestler?

05:25.040 --> 05:27.247
I wish.
That would be awesome.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.243
No, the...
The Old Testament dude.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.086
He got all biblical on me
and gave me his mark.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.368
What does that even mean?
How did that happen?

05:39.240 --> 05:40.765
Crowley and I found him
and he gave me this,

05:40.920 --> 05:43.207
so that I could eighty-six Abaddon,
once and for all.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.925
You worked a job with Crowley?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.565
The devil you know.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.521
Garth?

05:54.880 --> 05:56.120
What?

06:04.440 --> 06:05.805
Son of a bitch.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.686
Why would Garth run from us?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.763
Why haven't we heard from him
for the last six months?

06:14.920 --> 06:16.445
Did you test him?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.483
He was unconscious!
No, I...

06:19.480 --> 06:21.084
He steal a car?

06:22.240 --> 06:25.084
Did he steal a car naked?

06:29.480 --> 06:30.811
I'll see what I can
find on those cameras.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.644
Why don't you go talk
to Farmer Brown.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.404
- See about that cow?
- Yeah.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.204
Last week, it was
a couple of chickens.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.044
Goat, the week before that.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.640
So, when I saw that boy
tearing out of my barn,

06:44.720 --> 06:46.848
hell, yeah, I was gonna
ask questions later.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.281
Now, the animals, were they
all killed in the same manner?

06:49.320 --> 06:50.685
More like sacrificed.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.046
What do you mean by that?

06:52.200 --> 06:56.683
Their organs was ripped clean out.
Only the organs.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.650
If this wasn't some kind of
devil-worship thing, I don't know what.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.285
Hmm.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.442
Well, thanks.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.121
Yeah.

07:07.320 --> 07:11.006
So, the cow wasn't just killed,
it was eviscerated.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.646
- Why was Garth there?
- He said he was on a hunt, right?

07:13.800 --> 07:15.529
Maybe he was hunting
whatever killed it.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.681
Why would he run?

07:16.840 --> 07:19.160
This whole thing's starting to stink.
You know that, right?

07:19.680 --> 07:22.445
Yeah. Well, what about you?
Any luck?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.647
Nada. Cameras were pointing
in the wrong direction.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.122
- You're kidding.
- Wish I was.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.964
- Hmm. So...
- So, Garth's a Hunter.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.849
If he wants to stay gone, he's gone.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.889
We got nothing?

07:36.040 --> 07:39.522
Well, what can I say, Sammy?
We lost this one. Send me a postcard.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.046
Wow.
Make, model...

07:46.920 --> 07:49.810
...license plate.
Really, Dean?

07:49.960 --> 07:52.122
I told you we can't hunt together.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.889
It's for your own good.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.251
I hear you.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.721
And after we find Garth and get
to the bottom of this, I'm gone.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.565
But until then, no more games.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.040
Ride belongs to a girl
named Bess Meyers.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.162
She lives in the next town over.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, guys.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.961
I can explain, everything's cool.
Just a simple misunderstanding.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.406
Who you talking to?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.090
- What?
- The girl?

08:22.720 --> 08:23.767
What...
What girl?

08:26.120 --> 08:28.691
What the...
What now?

08:30.320 --> 08:32.448
All right, all right, guys,
everyone needs to take a chill-pill

08:32.600 --> 08:34.284
and put their guns down.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.409
You see? Let's all be grown-ups here
and have an adult conversation.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.124
No!

08:54.320 --> 08:57.881
Sam.
Sam, please, don't hurt her.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.480
What are you doing?
She's a werewolf!

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
So am I.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.006
It's okay, baby.
Hold it like that.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.480
What are they doing here, Garth?

09:20.600 --> 09:23.649
- They're friends, I promise.
- They're Hunters.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.847
All right,

09:27.040 --> 09:29.680
we've gotten off on the wrong foot here.
So, let's do things right.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.522
Boys, this is Bess,

09:32.680 --> 09:34.842
my beloved.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.601
And Bess, that's Dean.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.280
He could start a fight in an empty
house, but deep down inside,

09:41.320 --> 09:43.402
he's just a big, old teddy bear.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.331
And Sam, here,
Sam can be a bit insecure, at times,

09:46.520 --> 09:47.567
but for good reason.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.449
Bless his heart.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.641
That's sweet.
Werewolf?

09:53.400 --> 09:54.925
All right, guys, look.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.844
About six months ago,
I was outside Portland, Maine,

09:57.000 --> 09:58.923
hunting this big, bad wolf.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.004
I took him down,
but he bit me in the process.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.486
And you didn't call one of us?

10:03.640 --> 10:05.608
And tell you what?
That I messed up?

10:05.760 --> 10:08.161
No, I knew the deal.

10:08.320 --> 10:11.403
There's no cure
so I accepted my fate.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.564
Ate my favorite dish
of Egg Foo Young,

10:14.720 --> 10:18.167
watched the world's greatest movie,
Rocky Ill, and then...

10:18.320 --> 10:20.926
...was ready to eat a bullet
when Bess, here, found me.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.764
And how did she do that?

10:22.920 --> 10:25.207
Smelled him.
How else?

10:27.280 --> 10:29.442
Yeah, she talked
the gun outta my mouth

10:29.600 --> 10:32.001
and as they say, the rest is history.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.401
We've been married
for four months, now.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.891
You're married?

10:36.040 --> 10:37.405
- To a werewolf?
- Yes.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.449
And my pack has taken him in
as one of our own.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.283
Guys, it's not what you think.
We don't hurt people.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.091
No, you just go all Wolverine
on cattle.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.041
Yeah.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.407
At least he's not
eating human hearts.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.608
Do you have any idea
how hard it is for a bitten

10:55.800 --> 10:58.770
to control his instincts,
like Garth does?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.524
How well he's doing?

11:01.280 --> 11:02.520
Thank you, baby.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.484
Well, it's the truth, honey-bunny.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.207
Wait, a "bitten"?
You're all bitten.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.091
Not at all.
You're either born to it, like I was

11:11.240 --> 11:14.244
or you're bitten, like Garth.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.922
Wait, hold on. You said you were...
You were born a werewolf?

11:19.480 --> 11:20.811
Second generation.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.042
Garth, can we talk to you,
for a sec, alone?

11:28.720 --> 11:33.009
Honey, why don't you go find
some ointment for that arm, okay?

11:38.200 --> 11:39.201
What the hell?

11:40.120 --> 11:42.805
Look, I know you guys wanna
shoot first and ask questions later,

11:42.960 --> 11:44.962
but I checked everything out.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.485
This pack is clean.

11:46.680 --> 11:47.886
Everything's kosher.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.327
Right, minus the part
where your wife attacked me.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.649
Yeah, because you two came busting
in here like a house on fire!

11:53.800 --> 11:56.929
Guns waving, the jawlines
and the hair, it's very intimidating.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.765
What'd you expect?

11:59.920 --> 12:04.289
Dean, no one wants any trouble.
You got my word on that.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.844
Oh, no, that ship has sailed.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.321
We're gonna need a hell
of a lot more than your word.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.006
Okay, okay.
Tell you what,

12:12.160 --> 12:14.561
you want proof?
Come pray with us.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.763
- You there?
- Yeah, just pulled up.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.245
Nothing too sketchy yet.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.765
That's a good thing, right?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.729
Not betting on it.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.805
Or are we just that jaded?
I mean, maybe Garth's right.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.406
Well, ain't you a glass half-full.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.005
Any luck with the cops?

12:44.200 --> 12:47.761
Sheriff should be rolling up
any second. Be careful.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.331
Yeah.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.161
You must be Dean.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.209
I'm Joy,
Garth's mother-in-law...

13:07.960 --> 13:11.203
Stepmother-in-law, which I always
thought sounded so silly.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.886
Please, come in.
We're just finishing up.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.560
Why don't you just
tell Garth I'm here?

13:16.480 --> 13:20.007
Dean, you have my word,
you're safe under my roof.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.969
I only ask the same in return.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.726
After all,
I'm not the one carrying silver.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.603
Thank you, Brother Garth.
Wonderful accompaniment, as usual.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.401
And I'll see the rest of you
in the pews, 9:00 AM, sharp.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.564
No stragglers...
Sister Amelia.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.404
Hi. So, what'd I tell you?
It's all good, right?

14:31.640 --> 14:32.926
Everyone here's a wolf?

14:33.080 --> 14:34.366
- Yeah.
- Yeah, not all good.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.243
Oh, come on, Dean,
you just gotta meet them.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.050
That's Russ and Joba,

14:39.200 --> 14:41.851
Bess' first cousins
on Sister Joy's side.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.809
That's Reverend Jim, Bess' dad.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.769
Leader of the pack and a good man.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.962
Dean, isn't it?
Welcome.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.480
Jim Meyers.
Folks usually call me...

14:50.560 --> 14:51.925
Reverend Jim.
Yeah, I got it.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.443
Oh, my bad.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.409
Dean's got this crazy fear of germs.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.610
I understand your apprehension, Dean.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.570
Hunters and our kind don't have
the best history together.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.610
But I think you'll find
we're not much different from you.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.450
Oh, Sister, I highly doubt it.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.250
Why don't we break bread and see?

15:13.480 --> 15:14.480
Why would I do that?

15:21.840 --> 15:23.046
Dean!

15:23.200 --> 15:24.361
What?

15:28.840 --> 15:31.605
Now, everybody, eat up,

15:31.760 --> 15:33.683
but make sure you leave room for pie.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.571
Sister Joy's pies are famous
throughout the Badger State.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.811
Mm!
Dean loves pie.

15:55.240 --> 15:58.210
Don't you guys say some sort
of a grace or something?

15:58.360 --> 16:01.125
We're more spiritual
than we are religious.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.282
We believe, much like
the American Indians did,

16:03.480 --> 16:04.720
that nature and man are one.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.844
Yeah, that really
worked out well for them.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.203
Why are a bunch of werewolves wearing
silver bullets around their necks?

16:26.720 --> 16:29.644
Sorry, Dean, but we don't use
the "W" word around here.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.410
We prefer the term "lycanthrope."

16:32.000 --> 16:33.081
"We"?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.402
He's entitled to his opinion, Garth.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.640
Many of our kind see themselves
as indestructible.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.246
This is a constant reminder

16:42.400 --> 16:44.448
of how precious our lives truly are.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.921
Yeah, but it's silver.
I mean, doesn't it burn?

16:47.080 --> 16:49.447
Yeah, it does, a bit.
But that's kind of the point.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.170
It's reminds us of our fragility.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.601
My daughter, Bess,
was born a lycanthrope.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.489
It was one of the proudest days
of my life.

16:58.040 --> 17:01.726
Which soon turned tragic,
when a Hunter killed my wife.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.890
Believe me when I tell you,
I wanted to make someone pay.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.407
Then, I looked at Bess...

17:09.560 --> 17:12.086
and I realized the road to revenge

17:12.240 --> 17:14.766
is a dark and lonely one,
which you never get off.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.119
And that hole in the pit
of your stomach,

17:17.240 --> 17:19.367
you never fill it, ever.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.525
Yeah, no, I get it.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.326
So, I chose to look forward,
not backwards.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.921
And the minute I did that,
the powers that be

17:31.080 --> 17:32.969
brought this beautiful,
compassionate,

17:33.120 --> 17:35.726
amazing woman into my life.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.566
And she helped me raise a little
baby girl, as if Bess were her own.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.768
I can't take all the credit.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.730
Daddy had a hand in it, too.
He saw your potential.

17:46.720 --> 17:47.721
"Daddy"?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.880
My father, bless his soul,

17:52.040 --> 17:54.486
was the previous reverend
of our church,

17:54.640 --> 17:57.371
the third generation
in our family to serve.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.921
So, you're fourth generation
werewolf?

18:00.360 --> 18:01.361
Yes.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.849
Look, the good Reverend Jim
and his family

18:09.000 --> 18:11.810
are all a little new-agey
and hippy-dippy-like,

18:11.960 --> 18:16.124
but they're clean as a whistle
and pillars of our community.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.607
Why is the FBI
even interested in them?

18:18.800 --> 18:20.484
I just go
where they send me, Sheriff.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.571
Truth be told, I'm more interested
in murders and X-Files-y stuff.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.449
Anything of that variety,
around here?

18:27.600 --> 18:30.763
No, sir, we're just a small town,
not much crime of any to speak of.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.650
I'm sorry, Agent,
I wish I could be more help.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.410
That's all right.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.370
But if you do think of something
give me a call.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.567
Will do.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.485
Still hungry?

18:54.720 --> 18:57.530
Yeah, no, I was just seeing
if you had any beer.

18:58.320 --> 19:02.405
The sooner you realize that all
is good here, the sooner you can go.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.809
Don't you two have a chew toy
or something to go play with?

19:06.960 --> 19:09.531
Hey, guys.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.603
You mind if I grab a second
with Dean, here?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.243
Why are you being
so hard on everyone?

19:24.400 --> 19:27.324
Because there's no way
that all of this

19:27.480 --> 19:29.369
is what it looks like.
No way.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.050
- Why not?
- Come on, man.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.010
I know you drank the Kool-Aid, okay,
but come on.

19:34.160 --> 19:37.164
Look, amigo,

19:37.360 --> 19:41.251
I know this all looks nuts,
but I found it:

19:41.400 --> 19:43.084
love and a family.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.487
Who cares where that comes from?

19:46.600 --> 19:47.601
I do.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.649
I get it.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.644
When I first got here,
I couldn't let go either.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.007
I kept waiting
for the other shoe to drop,

19:55.160 --> 19:58.528
but when it didn't,
I had to accept the truth.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.321
Well, I got another truth for you.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.131
We were all left in the dark
when you went AWOL.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.126
God, I didn't even know
if you were dead or worse.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.203
You should have reached out
and sent someone a message.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.091
And said what, Dean?
That I was a werewolf?

20:16.640 --> 20:20.486
I was embarrassed. I thought it best
for everyone if I just stayed away.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.564
But doesn't mean
that I didn't think about

20:23.720 --> 20:27.327
and miss you and Sam, Kevin.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.641
Kevin's gone.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.281
What?

20:41.880 --> 20:42.881
Gone for good.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.929
What happened?

20:47.320 --> 20:50.210
When he needed me,
I wasn't there, that's what.

20:53.960 --> 20:58.010
Okay, Dean,
they gave you lunch and pie.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.530
Why are we still here?

21:02.360 --> 21:04.362
No, yeah, you're right.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.284
Yeah, Garth's good.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.850
You wanna hit the road,
it's square by me.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.684
Look, I'm just saying,
this wouldn't be the first time

21:10.840 --> 21:12.444
we came across a friendly monster.

21:12.600 --> 21:16.241
Or a family of friendly monsters,
whatever this is.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.765
Agent Perry.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.730
Sheriff, how can I help you?

21:30.640 --> 21:32.290
Really?

21:33.360 --> 21:35.203
Okay.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.723
Well, you wanted weird, Agent.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.723
You tell me what tore up that deer.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.848
Nothing that runs in these parts.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.481
It's fresh blood.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.689
Yes, it is.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.561
Still warm.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.681
That means it died
after we got the call.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.771
Couldn't just accept that all
was good and move on, could you?

22:37.920 --> 22:41.766
You have no idea
what you've walked into, do you?

22:42.680 --> 22:43.841
No matter.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.604
You won't be walking outta here.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.361
Hey.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.849
Look at this.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.570
I've seen that before.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.042
Yeah, that is a favorite accessory
of the good reverend and his flock.

23:13.480 --> 23:14.481
"Ragnarok"?

23:15.960 --> 23:18.611
Yeah, that's Thor, Loki,
Odin stuff, right?

23:18.760 --> 23:21.604
Yeah, it's Norse mythology's End of
Days. Why's it etched onto a bullet?

23:23.160 --> 23:24.924
Who cares?
We got all the answers we need.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.844
I don't know, Dean.
I think we need more.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.480
Oh, what, Sheriff Andy Taylor here
wasn't good enough for you?

23:31.680 --> 23:32.761
Enough to kill Garth?

23:32.920 --> 23:35.366
Come on, man,
let's do this right.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.410
All right, fine.
Clean this up,

23:39.600 --> 23:41.523
grab Garth, lock him up,
until we figure out what's what.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.080
I'm gonna go check out that church.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.281
Garth?

25:30.960 --> 25:32.291
Seriously?

25:47.240 --> 25:48.890
Hey.
Did you find the lovebirds?

25:49.040 --> 25:51.691
No.
Place is a wreck.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.530
No Garth, no Bess.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.690
What, they were taken?
Well, that's fan-friggin' tastic.

25:58.840 --> 25:59.880
Tell me you got something.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.368
Well, this Ragnarok
End of Days crap...

26:03.520 --> 26:07.047
Star of the story is a wolf named
Fenris, who kills the god Odin,

26:07.200 --> 26:08.645
before the world ends.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.245
Okay...
That helps us, how?

26:10.400 --> 26:14.086
There are cults that consider Fenris
a wolf deity and worship him.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.163
They call themselves,
"the Maw of Fenris."

26:16.320 --> 26:19.403
A cult of werewolves?
What do they want?

26:20.440 --> 26:23.364
Well, Ragnarok is not just a Bible story
to these nut-jobs,

26:23.560 --> 26:26.803
Human extinction.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.691
Total and complete
werewolf domination.

26:29.840 --> 26:34.164
And what, this is the ground zero
for their movement?

26:34.360 --> 26:36.010
Freaking Wisconsin, man.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.810
Well, time for Reverend Jim
to go down.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.005
Yeah.
Need any help?

26:42.160 --> 26:44.640
No, no, no, I got it, you just...
You find Garth.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.245
All right.

27:17.080 --> 27:20.402
It's no use, Dean,
I can hear your heartbeat.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.407
You must've done this countless times,
yet you still get nervous.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.082
Nothing wrong with a little fear.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.088
It's what makes us human.

27:32.240 --> 27:36.689
Fear is not a purely human instinct.
Even monsters know fear.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.560
I came to work on my sermon.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.969
Why don't you start by preaching
to me about the Maw of Fenris.

27:45.240 --> 27:49.165
Yeah, that's right. I know all about
you and your pack's little plan.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.923
I assure you,
we are planning nothing.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.129
No? Well, then why did I read
about it in your Good Book?

27:58.680 --> 28:00.921
Because generations ago,
that hate

28:01.080 --> 28:04.243
and misplaced anger
was part of our beliefs.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.769
But ever since I took over here,

28:07.920 --> 28:09.763
I have eradicated it
from our congregation.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.571
Yeah, well, apparently,
some of them didn't get the word.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.610
Like the good sheriff, who just
tried to off me and my brother.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.641
Sheriff Pat?

28:19.520 --> 28:20.520
Let me see your bullet.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.848
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.047
"Ragnarok."

28:35.200 --> 28:36.531
What?

28:36.680 --> 28:38.240
It was etched
into the sheriff's bullet.

28:38.400 --> 28:41.006
That's impossible.
The Maw is dead.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.960
Yeah, well, tell that to Garth
and your daughter who are missing.

28:50.080 --> 28:51.081
No.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.201
Bess.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.441
Sam.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.806
What are you two doing?

29:08.640 --> 29:10.881
Russ? Joba?

29:15.040 --> 29:17.646
Mom, what is going on?

29:19.160 --> 29:22.687
- Hey!
- First off, I'm not your mother.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.888
You leave her alone,
you hear me?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.809
You wanna hurt somebody,
hurt me!

29:26.960 --> 29:29.850
Oh, that is so sweet.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.923
But I am going to hurt her,

29:32.120 --> 29:34.441
and him,

29:35.360 --> 29:37.249
but especially you,

29:37.400 --> 29:39.687
for bringing these Hunters here.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.561
I'm gonna hurt all of you.

29:47.400 --> 29:48.845
I'm sorry.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.927
Come on, Sam, pick up, damn it!

30:18.960 --> 30:21.008
Please, don't do this.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.008
Not to Bess,
she's your daughter.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.606
How many times do I have to say this?

30:26.800 --> 30:28.689
Stepdaughter!

30:28.840 --> 30:32.287
I'm the last of my bloodline.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.681
Thanks to you
and your kind, out there.

30:34.840 --> 30:35.841
He's awake.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.765
Well, don't you just look
good enough to eat.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.481
Why are you doing this?

30:55.440 --> 30:59.286
I mean, me, I can understand,
but these people are your family,

30:59.440 --> 31:00.521
your pack.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.369
Last winter,
my little brother, Charlie,

31:10.440 --> 31:12.442
was killed by a Hunter.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.290
My husband counseled
patience, restraint.

31:18.440 --> 31:21.489
Just as when he took over
our beloved church,

31:21.640 --> 31:23.961
he preached a new direction.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.803
Lycanthropes and man would coexist.

31:29.440 --> 31:33.047
Peace was more important
than dominance.

31:33.840 --> 31:38.289
I tried so hard
to make his way work...

31:39.560 --> 31:41.801
...to be a preacher's wife.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.650
But then,

31:43.800 --> 31:46.167
Charlie was murdered.

31:47.720 --> 31:52.567
And I couldn't help
remembering my daddy's sermons.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.609
And by golly,
turns out he was right.

31:58.560 --> 32:03.441
As long as there is a man,
there can be no peace.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.524
Because man destroys.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.169
And I, for one, am sick of it.

32:32.440 --> 32:34.522
I get it now.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.121
Why coexist, when you can rule?

32:37.280 --> 32:39.044
Bingo.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.521
But my husband
doesn't see it that way.

32:42.160 --> 32:46.131
See, he was bitten,
not born into it, like I was.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.204
He still holds on to his humanity.

32:49.400 --> 32:53.564
Which is why I am so pleased
it will be his claws

32:53.760 --> 32:56.240
that start Ragnarok, not mine.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.931
You and your brother
coming here was

32:59.120 --> 33:02.010
a blessing from Fenris above.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.766
The two of you cornered Garth, here

33:04.960 --> 33:06.450
and then, when Bess came running in

33:06.600 --> 33:09.649
to see what the fuss was about,
you killed her.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.330
No!

33:12.240 --> 33:13.571
Here.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.526
Silver to the heart.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.682
You're gonna frame
their murders on me.

33:20.840 --> 33:24.401
My husband turned his cheek once.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.728
I don't think he can do it again.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.244
Hey!
Get away from her!

33:30.440 --> 33:32.442
Killing you gives me no joy,

33:32.600 --> 33:36.605
but Ragnarok,
it's bigger than all of us.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.685
You're sick.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.163
You're just dying for me to get
my claws dirty, aren't you?

34:13.719 --> 34:17.850
Wearing Russ' coat
to hide your scent. Smart.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.047
Oh, I'm full of surprises.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.245
As am I.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.050
Be good, you hear me?

34:40.199 --> 34:42.248
I will.
Thanks, Sam.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.443
How's he doing?

34:59.600 --> 35:00.726
He's taking it pretty hard.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.247
Feels like he should have
seen the signs earlier.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.044
Yeah, well, maybe you were right.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.488
Yeah, he seems like a good man,
considering.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.529
Yeah, and you were right.

35:12.680 --> 35:15.809
Everything around here
wasn't copasetic.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.166
I screwed up, again.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.041
First, Kevin, now this.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.444
Hey, Kevin, that's on me.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.211
I'm the one
that pulled him into all this.

35:27.760 --> 35:30.809
I'm the one that should have
been there to protect him.

35:31.840 --> 35:35.606
Well, I guess there's enough
of that blame to go around, then.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.846
Dean.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.047
Yeah.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.488
I know this may sound
a little crazy, but...

35:47.400 --> 35:48.765
...maybe I could come back
and hunt with you.

35:48.920 --> 35:52.288
I mean, with my werewolf mojo,
we'd have an advantage.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.881
- Yeah, look, Garth...
- No, Dean...

35:57.120 --> 35:59.088
...I wanna make this right.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.527
I never should have left you guys,
especially, Kevin.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.324
Kevin was my friend.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.691
Friends don't do that.

36:10.240 --> 36:14.245
Well, hey, you said it. You know,
who cares where happiness comes from?

36:16.160 --> 36:18.640
Look, we're all a little weird,
we're all a little wacky,

36:18.800 --> 36:20.290
some more than others.

36:20.440 --> 36:23.011
But if it works, it works.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.441
You got something here.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.365
Yeah, even though
they are werewolves...

36:28.520 --> 36:30.284
Lycanthropes, whatever.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.331
Don't let that go.

36:33.480 --> 36:36.450
Okay?
You'll never forgive yourself.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.202
Besides, somebody's gotta live
to tell this damn story someday.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.885
Who better than you?

36:44.920 --> 36:46.160
Now, shut up and come here.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.961
- Really?
- Hurry up, before I change my mind.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.722
- I'll send you that postcard.
- Yeah.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.401
Hey.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.487
Uh...

37:40.520 --> 37:42.921
Listen, that night that...

37:43.120 --> 37:44.770
...you know, when we went
on our separate ways...

37:44.880 --> 37:46.530
You mean the night you split?

37:49.720 --> 37:51.006
Fair enough.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.486
I was messed up, man.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.411
Kevin was dead and I...

38:00.320 --> 38:02.163
I don't know what I was.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.041
Okay.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.845
Hell, maybe I still don't.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.369
But...

38:16.640 --> 38:19.689
...I know I took a piece of you
in the process and for that...

38:24.400 --> 38:26.084
Somebody changed the playbook, man.

38:26.280 --> 38:28.931
You know, it's like
what's right is wrong

38:29.080 --> 38:31.287
and what's wrong is more wrong.

38:31.440 --> 38:32.646
And I...

38:35.120 --> 38:36.849
I just know that when...

38:37.800 --> 38:40.201
When we rode together...

38:40.360 --> 38:42.169
We split the crappiness?

38:44.080 --> 38:45.127
Yeah.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.560
So...

38:55.160 --> 38:56.605
Okay.

38:58.920 --> 38:59.967
Okay.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.202
But something's broken here, Dean.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.762
I'm not saying that it's not.
I...

39:07.000 --> 39:09.002
I just think maybe we need to put
a couple "W" s on the board

39:09.200 --> 39:11.885
- and we can get past all this.
- I don't think so.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.281
No, I wish, but...

39:16.480 --> 39:20.405
...we don't see things
the same way anymore...

39:21.240 --> 39:23.811
Our roles in this whole thing.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.842
Back in that church,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.924
talking me out of boarding up Hell?

39:30.960 --> 39:34.885
Or... Or tricking me
into letting Gadreel possess me.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.323
I can't trust you.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.249
Not the way I thought I could.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.209
Not the way I should be able to.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.721
Okay, look.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.564
Whatever happened...

39:52.480 --> 39:54.801
...we are family, okay?

39:56.480 --> 39:58.642
You say that
like it's some sort of cure-all.

39:58.800 --> 40:02.009
Like it can change the fact
that everything

40:02.160 --> 40:06.165
that has ever gone wrong between us,
has been because we're family.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.890
So, what, we're not family now?

40:09.040 --> 40:11.964
I'm saying you wanna work,
let's work.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.129
If you wanna be brothers...

40:21.160 --> 40:22.810
...well, those are my terms.
