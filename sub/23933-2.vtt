00:08.279 --> 00:09.589
(Episode 2)

00:14.889 --> 00:16.090
Did you make it?

00:17.389 --> 00:18.430
Did you fail?

00:20.600 --> 00:21.600
Come on.

00:21.999 --> 00:23.970
Did you make it,\Nor did you fail?

00:25.670 --> 00:26.970
Made it.

00:27.670 --> 00:28.769
You did?

00:28.769 --> 00:30.440
- You did.\N- "You did"?

00:35.979 --> 00:37.049
I did?

00:42.619 --> 00:44.490
(Yoo Seol Ji,\NYoo Seol Yang)

00:48.719 --> 00:50.990
I tried so hard.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.030
I thought I would\Nmake it this time.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.600
Which one would you like?

01:37.369 --> 01:38.369
I need...

01:38.740 --> 01:40.940
something extremely sweet.

01:53.360 --> 01:57.830
(Seo Hyun Soo)

01:57.830 --> 01:58.830
What?

01:59.259 --> 02:00.929
Seo Hyun Soo visited you?

02:02.759 --> 02:04.770
So what did she say?

02:06.270 --> 02:09.538
It's been 17, 18 years.

02:09.639 --> 02:11.410
Could you even\Nrecognize her?

02:11.839 --> 02:13.110
I didn't get to meet her.

02:13.110 --> 02:14.809
Did you check\Nthe security cameras?

02:14.980 --> 02:16.779
They were\Nundergoing a check-up.

02:19.580 --> 02:21.950
Seo Hyun Soo is dead.

02:22.450 --> 02:24.490
You collected\Nher body yourself.

02:24.490 --> 02:27.390
Then who is pretending\Nto be her, and why?

02:28.119 --> 02:29.790
Bo Gook, I'm a detective.

02:29.830 --> 02:31.830
I'm not getting swayed\Nwith my emotions.

02:32.629 --> 02:34.059
There's something to this.

02:46.010 --> 02:47.010
Detective Ha?

02:48.409 --> 02:49.409
Hello.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.849
Have you seen\NSeol Ok by any chance?

02:54.279 --> 02:56.820
She went to a convenience\Nstore and hasn't returned.

02:57.119 --> 02:59.490
Did she find out\Nher test result?

03:00.219 --> 03:01.219
Yes.

03:13.140 --> 03:14.300
Mother.

03:14.439 --> 03:15.999
Why aren't you eating?

03:16.809 --> 03:17.909
Because...

03:18.110 --> 03:19.510
What's with the long face?

03:20.439 --> 03:22.040
Did you fail again?

03:23.809 --> 03:24.980
Goodness.

03:25.110 --> 03:27.149
What a relief.

03:27.679 --> 03:29.990
Being a policewoman at\Nyour age is tough.

03:30.689 --> 03:33.760
Don't waste your time.\NCome back home.

03:34.189 --> 03:35.860
Come home and live\Ncomfortably.

03:35.860 --> 03:38.689
Why would you make your\Nlife hard?

03:39.860 --> 03:40.929
Come home.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.409
Where can she be now?

03:52.240 --> 03:53.839
Are you sure\Nyou care about her?

03:53.879 --> 03:55.339
Of course I do.

04:05.719 --> 04:07.520
Why are there so many fire\Naccidents these days?

04:08.390 --> 04:11.830
I hope she's not thinking\Nof doing foolish things.

04:11.830 --> 04:13.159
I think she already is.

04:13.159 --> 04:14.230
What?

04:17.730 --> 04:19.969
Tell her she'll get fat if\Nshe eats late at night.

04:38.989 --> 04:40.020
Seol Ok.

04:40.620 --> 04:41.620
Yes?

04:45.859 --> 04:46.930
Kyung Mi.

04:47.799 --> 04:49.260
It's so delicious.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.500
Is it delicious?

04:50.969 --> 04:52.270
You should try it too.

04:52.270 --> 04:53.799
I don't like sweet stuff.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.440
What good things do you\Nhave in life?

04:58.310 --> 05:00.180
I'll have it all.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.609
Seol Ok. Are you okay?

05:06.109 --> 05:07.180
Me?

05:11.589 --> 05:12.620
Right.

05:13.159 --> 05:14.919
I've failed the test.

05:17.659 --> 05:19.390
I can take it again\Nnext time.

05:19.859 --> 05:21.799
I'll take it until I pass.

05:25.099 --> 05:27.940
You're such a genius\Nin catching criminals.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.739
Eat it with some tea.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.510
Are you really having it\Nbecause it's delicious?

05:36.779 --> 05:38.549
I've failed my test.

05:38.549 --> 05:41.479
I can't afford to fail my\Nappetite. I lose so much.

05:41.549 --> 05:44.250
Life isn't so special.\NIt's all about eating.

05:45.049 --> 05:46.859
It's rather good that\NI failed.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.159
Imagine if I've passed\Nthe test.

05:49.159 --> 05:50.630
I wouldn't have had this\Ndelicious cake because...

05:50.630 --> 05:53.200
I would have\Nto go training.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.000
Right.\NGood job on failing.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.339
I'll have my cake, and\NI'll pass the next test.

06:01.799 --> 06:03.669
What a clumsy girl.

06:07.109 --> 06:09.180
You're just like my mom\Nat times like this.

06:09.180 --> 06:11.479
I look younger than you.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.390
- Please have one bite.\N- No, I don't want to.

06:16.450 --> 06:18.390
Please. I'll have it\Nwhen you have it.

06:18.390 --> 06:20.659
You're done.\NThere's nothing to eat.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.560
Please try it.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.089
My goodness.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.529
What are you going\Nto do now?

06:29.130 --> 06:30.169
About what?

06:30.799 --> 06:33.200
You want to be\Na policewoman too.

06:34.870 --> 06:36.770
It's since you met\NMr. Bae, right?

06:38.969 --> 06:40.839
You're good at\Ncatching things now.

06:42.479 --> 06:44.609
Why don't you\Ngive it a try?

06:44.609 --> 06:45.880
Try things\Nthat you want to.

06:46.779 --> 06:49.450
I can't even do it even\Nif I want to.

06:53.859 --> 06:54.859
What?

06:56.630 --> 06:58.089
Is there fire?

06:58.859 --> 07:01.130
Isn't that my house?

07:01.899 --> 07:02.969
You're right.

07:05.770 --> 07:06.799
How did you find it?

07:06.799 --> 07:09.270
- Where did she go?\N- I thought she's here.

07:09.270 --> 07:10.469
There isn't any witness?

07:10.710 --> 07:12.010
Is that Yoo Seol Ok?

07:12.469 --> 07:14.539
It's Yoo Seol Ok.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.750
- Oh, gosh.\N- She's here.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.020
You're Yoo Seol Ok, right?

07:23.020 --> 07:24.620
Do you know me?

07:24.620 --> 07:27.089
Are you the one who caught\Nthe marriage fraud?

07:27.089 --> 07:28.690
You pretended to be the\Nbride to catch him.

07:28.690 --> 07:29.760
Am I right?

07:31.289 --> 07:33.500
It wasn't entirely me.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.000
How did you think of\Nacting like the bride?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.599
Was it a joint strategy\Nwith the police?

07:37.599 --> 07:38.729
Or was it your own idea?

07:38.729 --> 07:40.770
The wedding dress you wore\Nis a hot topic these days.

07:40.770 --> 07:42.339
Where did you get it?

07:42.969 --> 07:44.070
Which shop was it?

07:47.210 --> 07:49.810
The groom's mother\Ngot it for her.

07:50.779 --> 07:52.750
What was police doing...

07:52.750 --> 07:54.919
when a weak\Ncivilian woman...

07:54.919 --> 07:57.950
took an action to catch\Nthe matrimonial swindler?

07:57.950 --> 08:00.159
It's Hyun Jin Young\Nwith SBC news.

08:07.460 --> 08:08.599
(Thank you for reporting\Nabout Yoo Seol Ok.)

08:08.599 --> 08:09.599
(From Reporter\NYim Seung Hyun)

08:29.320 --> 08:30.649
(Appointing Ceremony of\NYoo Seol Ok...)

08:30.649 --> 08:31.950
(as Honorary Police\NOfficer)

08:35.020 --> 08:36.529
Yoo Seol Ok.

08:36.929 --> 08:39.999
We're appointing you as an\Nhonorary police officer.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.859
February 21, 2018.

08:42.999 --> 08:45.599
Chief of the National\NPolice Agency, An Il Yong.

08:47.499 --> 08:48.969
(Certificate of\NAppointment)

09:04.489 --> 09:06.790
Why our department\Nout of all?

09:07.259 --> 09:08.619
She'd have joined\Nanother team...

09:08.619 --> 09:09.690
if you hadn't crossed.

09:10.060 --> 09:11.160
I can explain.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.359
Some civilian reported\Non the case.

09:13.359 --> 09:14.960
We had no choice\Nbut to make a move.

09:15.729 --> 09:16.930
I'm sorry, sir.

09:17.229 --> 09:18.930
Who has dragged\Nthis civilian in...

09:19.200 --> 09:20.869
and ruined my reputation?

09:22.400 --> 09:24.210
It's Lieutenant Ha from\NSeodong Station.

09:24.210 --> 09:25.369
He's a crazy guy.

09:25.369 --> 09:27.009
Ha Wan Seung?

09:27.009 --> 09:28.879
Yes, do you know him?

09:31.180 --> 09:34.219
Why didn't Seodong Station\Nwrap this up?

09:34.780 --> 09:36.619
Why would he cross\Nthe bridge?

09:49.259 --> 09:50.330
Sir.

09:52.129 --> 09:54.200
Do I go home now?

09:54.200 --> 09:56.540
Yes, you may go home now.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.139
You've done a good job,\NYoo Seol Ok.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.509
Am I a real\Npolicewoman now?

10:01.739 --> 10:04.379
Yes. I hope you can\Ncontribute a lot...

10:04.650 --> 10:06.379
as a civilian policewoman.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.450
Where is my seat?

10:08.749 --> 10:11.190
Is it at Seodong or\NJoongjin Station?

10:12.290 --> 10:14.219
- That...\N- We'll call you back.

10:14.219 --> 10:15.560
This way, sir.

10:20.460 --> 10:22.300
Come on, Chief Shin.

10:22.700 --> 10:23.869
I'm sorry, sir.

10:23.969 --> 10:25.769
We won't let this\Nhappen again.

10:32.639 --> 10:35.009
When will you give\Nme a call?

10:41.820 --> 10:45.650
(Queen of Mystery 2)

10:49.359 --> 10:52.660
This house would feel\Nso big without you.

10:53.499 --> 10:56.060
I'll come home right after\Nthe training.

10:56.060 --> 10:57.729
It's good for you now\Nwith Detective Ha.

10:57.729 --> 10:58.830
Don't be silly.

11:04.369 --> 11:05.910
Is Detective Ha moving?

11:06.780 --> 11:09.339
I don't know.\NI haven't heard anything.

11:09.339 --> 11:10.479
Hey.

11:11.849 --> 11:13.150
Are you moving?

11:13.950 --> 11:15.719
- Can't you see?\N- To where?

11:15.719 --> 11:16.849
Joongjin-dong.

11:16.849 --> 11:17.989
Joongjin-dong?

11:19.790 --> 11:20.989
It's not even far.

11:21.259 --> 11:23.129
Don't follow me\Nbecause it's not far.

11:23.129 --> 11:24.389
I hate lingering women.

11:24.389 --> 11:26.629
Why would I go to\Nyour house?

11:26.629 --> 11:29.099
Good. Live well, then.

12:05.170 --> 12:07.239
(Welcome to police\Ntraining academy)

12:10.109 --> 12:11.109
Bye.

12:38.070 --> 12:39.999
I'm alone for real.

12:41.339 --> 12:42.440
Lady.

12:47.210 --> 12:49.910
Lady, is the seat\Nnext to you empty?

12:54.550 --> 12:56.019
Why would he call me\Nlike that?

13:47.639 --> 13:48.940
There's fire!

13:49.239 --> 13:50.609
Goodness.

13:51.009 --> 13:53.280
Somebody, please help.\NIs there anyone?

13:53.979 --> 13:54.979
Goodness.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.450
Fire.

14:00.450 --> 14:02.519
- It's on fire.\N- What should I do?

14:02.650 --> 14:03.650
It's on fire.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.320
Gosh, fire.

14:09.089 --> 14:10.129
Gosh.

14:18.599 --> 14:21.070
Who threw\Na cigarette butt here?

14:21.070 --> 14:22.369
It almost became\Na huge fire.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.839
It's not by accident.

14:28.739 --> 14:30.509
Someone put it here...

14:30.810 --> 14:32.650
- on purpose.\N- What?

14:32.849 --> 14:35.519
Someone tried to burn down\Nthis store.

14:47.330 --> 14:48.359
It smells like\Nstrawberries.

14:48.629 --> 14:49.629
What?

14:49.700 --> 14:52.030
What's inside this bottle\Nis acetone.

14:55.499 --> 14:57.009
Its lid is open,

14:57.009 --> 14:59.509
but the acetone hasn't\Nbeen volatilized yet.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.680
And it's very unusual\Nthat the cigarette butt...

15:03.249 --> 15:04.450
flew to this bottle.

15:05.849 --> 15:08.050
This is arson.

15:08.619 --> 15:10.820
By the way, who are you?

15:12.349 --> 15:13.359
I'm...

15:26.540 --> 15:29.670
Just as a seed\Nstarts to bud...

15:31.369 --> 15:32.369
Just like that.

15:40.180 --> 15:41.979
It's Manager Jo of\NCriminal Affairs Division.

15:42.849 --> 15:45.889
Everyone in Joongjin\NStation hates autumn.

15:46.219 --> 15:47.219
Why?

15:47.560 --> 15:48.560
Autumn...

15:49.989 --> 15:51.830
is the season of\Nliterary contests.

15:54.999 --> 15:55.999
Watch out!

15:58.430 --> 16:01.200
Chrysanthemum...

16:02.769 --> 16:03.839
Corporal Gong.

16:05.239 --> 16:06.280
Corporal Gong!

16:06.979 --> 16:07.979
I...

16:08.479 --> 16:11.310
I have a new novel\Nin mind.

16:14.119 --> 16:15.180
Corporal Gong.

16:19.719 --> 16:20.719
(The Chief's Office)

16:20.719 --> 16:22.219
Do you know what\NNIMBY means?

16:23.290 --> 16:24.359
NIMBY.

16:24.660 --> 16:25.790
It means\N"Not In My Back Yard".

16:25.790 --> 16:27.830
Chief Shin is\Njust like NIMBY.

16:27.830 --> 16:29.300
Every time he\Nopens his mouth,

16:29.300 --> 16:30.599
he goes, "Why is it\Nmy division of all?"

16:30.599 --> 16:33.200
He nags his subordinates\Nto bring results.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.339
He's such a...

16:36.810 --> 16:37.869
Dad.

16:38.310 --> 16:39.369
Dad!

16:41.540 --> 16:44.080
I told you not to call me\Nlike that in here.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.310
Why not?

17:00.729 --> 17:02.359
Hello, Chief Shin.

17:02.599 --> 17:03.900
How have you been?

17:04.400 --> 17:05.569
It's so nice...

17:05.930 --> 17:07.339
to see you\Nafter a long time.

17:08.239 --> 17:09.569
What brings you here?

17:09.739 --> 17:12.039
I was appointed\Nto this station.

17:12.039 --> 17:13.640
- You were?\N- Yes.

17:13.739 --> 17:15.410
Hey, hey!

17:16.809 --> 17:17.880
Hello, Manager Jo.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.279
What happened?

17:22.049 --> 17:23.719
I'm sorry. I asked them...

17:23.719 --> 17:25.390
to send us a good-natured\Nman, and he's here.

17:25.619 --> 17:28.559
Well, I'm so sorry about\Nhow I reported you...

17:28.620 --> 17:29.989
for corruption in\Npersonnel appointments.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.390
I was immature then...

17:31.390 --> 17:33.799
that I didn't know it'd be\Ntreated lightly like so.

17:33.799 --> 17:35.259
Stop it\Nfor goodness' sake.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.670
What are you waiting for,\NCorporal Gong?

17:37.670 --> 17:38.670
Yes, sir.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.069
- Nice to meet you.\N- Nice to meet you too.

17:40.069 --> 17:41.400
I hope we get along.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.569
Thank you, sir.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.940
Show Detective Ha\Nhis desk.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.110
If you please excuse me.

17:51.150 --> 17:53.120
Unpack your stuff or not.\NI don't care.

17:54.779 --> 17:56.719
Chief Shin.

17:59.450 --> 18:00.460
Chief Shin.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.360
I'll attend you\Nas hard as I can...

18:02.660 --> 18:04.860
so that you won't\Nget inspected again.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.660
What's going on?

18:09.059 --> 18:10.329
It's not in my area.

18:10.329 --> 18:12.229
Well, I...

18:15.900 --> 18:18.170
- Hurry.\N- Gosh.

18:18.509 --> 18:19.640
Come to your senses.

18:21.509 --> 18:24.049
- You punk.\N- Are you settling it?

18:24.049 --> 18:26.150
Wait, we haven't come\Nto agreement yet.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.719
No wonder why\Nthis police station...

18:29.850 --> 18:31.249
is the best at arresting\Nviolent crimes.

18:32.289 --> 18:34.319
This is where I belong.

18:36.590 --> 18:37.829
Long time no see,\NWan Seung.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.360
Who are you?

18:43.229 --> 18:46.239
Mount Bomun

18:46.239 --> 18:47.870
I went to\Nhigh school abroad.

18:49.140 --> 18:50.140
Is it my middle\Nschool then?

18:50.539 --> 18:51.940
I know you. Wait a minute.

18:52.610 --> 18:53.610
Well...

18:54.380 --> 18:55.739
The 21st class of National\NPolice University.

18:56.809 --> 18:58.509
Gye Sung Woo.

18:58.509 --> 19:00.019
You're that smart\NGye Sung Woo, right?

19:00.019 --> 19:01.549
The Sung Woo who always\Nplaced at least third.

19:01.549 --> 19:02.819
Did I?

19:02.819 --> 19:05.850
Right. I always placed\N1st and you 3rd.

19:05.850 --> 19:08.190
You were appointed to\Nhere? Is it Unit Three?

19:08.190 --> 19:09.190
No.

19:09.219 --> 19:11.630
I was appointed\Nto Unit One.

19:11.630 --> 19:14.299
That's the ace team.\NCongratulations.

19:14.299 --> 19:15.960
My life is about\Nbeing the ace.

19:16.269 --> 19:17.299
What team are you in?

19:17.700 --> 19:19.069
Violent Crimes Unit One.

19:19.069 --> 19:20.069
Really?

19:20.239 --> 19:21.739
We're in the same unit?

19:21.739 --> 19:23.069
That's good to hear.

19:23.069 --> 19:24.410
It's really good to\Nsee you here.

19:24.410 --> 19:25.610
I'm the leader\Nof the unit.

19:29.779 --> 19:30.779
You are.

19:30.779 --> 19:31.779
Don't worry.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.779
I won't abuse my power\Nto my colleague...

19:34.779 --> 19:35.979
as long as you\Ndo your job.

19:38.989 --> 19:40.960
Let me show you your desk.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.360
Here.

19:43.529 --> 19:46.059
Say hello. He's your\Npartner from today on.

19:47.430 --> 19:50.130
(Detective Yuk Seung Hwa)

19:52.400 --> 19:53.400
I hope we get along.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.640
- I'll see you later.\N- Good luck today.

19:58.009 --> 20:00.110
What are you doing?\NHe's your partner.

20:00.809 --> 20:01.809
I just arrived here.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.450
Come on.\NYou need to work hard.

20:03.450 --> 20:05.210
Give me your things.\NGood luck.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.719
What's up with the mood?

20:11.350 --> 20:14.090
Gosh, someone\Nthrew the fire down.

20:14.819 --> 20:18.590
Some lunatic set\Nmy truck on fire!

20:19.029 --> 20:20.400
By the way, Detective,

20:20.400 --> 20:21.729
what should I do now?

20:21.729 --> 20:23.229
I was just appointed\Nto this town.

20:23.229 --> 20:24.829
My life depends\Non this truck.

20:24.829 --> 20:27.039
I still have\Ninstallments left to pay.

20:27.039 --> 20:28.799
All my family will starve\Nto death without this car.

20:28.799 --> 20:30.509
I'll investigate on it\Nthoroughly.

20:30.509 --> 20:31.569
Please step outside.

20:31.569 --> 20:33.340
Goodness.

20:49.489 --> 20:50.860
Was it a gasoline bomb?

21:00.969 --> 21:03.110
It's an old building\Nwithout any CCTV.

21:05.039 --> 21:06.279
Did you check the\Ndash cam footage?

21:07.710 --> 21:08.710
Hey.

21:09.539 --> 21:10.710
The dash cam footage.

21:18.450 --> 21:19.890
Did I do something\Nwrong to him?

21:20.390 --> 21:22.660
- Gosh.\N- What happened?

21:22.930 --> 21:24.789
Hey, guys!\NGet off that truck.

21:25.059 --> 21:27.400
You can't play here.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.870
Hey, come over here.\NYou brat. Come here.

21:31.769 --> 21:33.940
- Come here.\N- It hurts. Let me go.

21:33.940 --> 21:35.170
If you play here,

21:35.170 --> 21:36.309
I'll put handcuffs on you.

21:36.309 --> 21:38.610
You won't be able to go\Nhome or see your parents.

21:38.610 --> 21:41.009
- Isn't that scary, punk?\N- It hurts.

21:41.009 --> 21:42.739
- You little punk.\N- Mister!

21:43.380 --> 21:44.509
What are you doing?

21:44.509 --> 21:47.049
Mom. This mister...

21:47.479 --> 21:48.549
Go.

21:51.650 --> 21:54.719
Are you saying I set\Na fire on my own house?

21:54.719 --> 21:57.759
Gosh, you're blaming\Nan innocent person.

21:57.759 --> 21:59.860
- That's not it.\N- Then what?

21:59.860 --> 22:01.630
You said I did\Nset fire on my house.

22:01.630 --> 22:03.329
Ma'am. That's not\Nwhat I mean.

22:03.329 --> 22:05.329
You see this? Polystyrene\Nmay catch on fire...

22:05.329 --> 22:06.900
if it's near lime.

22:06.900 --> 22:09.299
I said it's not me.

22:09.299 --> 22:10.739
I paid a lot of money\Nto use it...

22:10.739 --> 22:12.809
- for my pepper field.\N- Say something.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.509
I would never\Nput it outside.

22:14.509 --> 22:16.140
Otherwise, others\Nmight take it.

22:16.140 --> 22:17.210
Goodbye.

22:21.019 --> 22:22.420
Why that...

22:22.420 --> 22:23.719
You can't go like this.

22:24.150 --> 22:26.289
You need to\Ncatch the culprit.

22:26.289 --> 22:28.660
- Of course, I will.\N- Okay.

22:29.460 --> 22:30.460
Well...

22:43.309 --> 22:46.039
It's easy to\Ncatch a fire...

22:46.039 --> 22:47.779
when acetone is vaporized.

22:48.739 --> 22:52.079
It's a kind of\Na delay device.

22:52.809 --> 22:55.519
While it was vaporized\Nand caught on fire,

22:55.519 --> 22:57.650
they were given enough\Ntime to run away.

22:59.620 --> 23:02.019
The customer that day\Nsaid the same thing.

23:02.789 --> 23:03.789
The customer?

23:03.789 --> 23:05.529
Yes, on that day,

23:05.529 --> 23:07.600
she put out\Nthe fire herself too.

23:08.329 --> 23:09.529
A lot of arsonists...

23:09.529 --> 23:12.799
show up on site and put\Nthe fire out themselves.

23:13.569 --> 23:16.269
Do you remember\Nwhat she looks like?

23:16.269 --> 23:18.140
Well...

23:26.620 --> 23:28.420
There she is again.

23:32.450 --> 23:33.489
Ms. Yoo?

23:33.890 --> 23:35.219
Inspector Woo.

23:36.059 --> 23:37.289
Hello, Inspector Woo.

23:38.130 --> 23:39.529
I saw the show.

23:39.529 --> 23:41.229
I'm sorry about that.

23:41.229 --> 23:43.529
I tried to make them\Nleave out the footage.

23:44.029 --> 23:47.499
But I did ask them\Nto blur out your face.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.440
I'll make sure\Nyou don't get shown...

23:50.440 --> 23:53.039
I was already on TV.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.009
I was on "KBC News" too.

23:56.009 --> 23:57.210
Haven't you seen it?

23:57.210 --> 23:58.880
I haven't. I was too busy.

24:05.950 --> 24:07.860
It doesn't look like\Nit was their first time.

24:08.759 --> 24:09.890
If the profiler...

24:09.890 --> 24:12.190
from the headquarters came\Nfor this tiny fire,

24:14.130 --> 24:15.660
it must be serial arson.

24:15.660 --> 24:17.499
You still got your game.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.999
Come on, don't say that.

24:21.299 --> 24:23.769
I'm even better now.

24:31.979 --> 24:33.249
This is Woo Sung Ha.

24:35.950 --> 24:38.090
A plastic bottle\Nand a cigarette butt?

24:39.219 --> 24:40.590
Is it Genoise?

24:41.519 --> 24:42.559
The fourth store.

24:43.559 --> 24:44.960
Yes, I'll be there\Nright now.

24:46.029 --> 24:48.130
Was there a fire\Nat the same franchise?

24:48.130 --> 24:49.969
It happened\Nthe same way, right?

24:49.969 --> 24:51.900
With acetone\Nand a cigarette butt.

24:51.900 --> 24:54.700
Ms. Yoo, I must go.

24:55.239 --> 24:58.569
It was great to see that\Nyou still had your game.

25:06.279 --> 25:08.979
Why is someone setting\Nthe stores on fire?

25:09.450 --> 25:11.019
We'll have to find out.

25:11.489 --> 25:14.120
May I ask you\Nto keep that for me?

25:19.700 --> 25:21.630
(Genoise, 4th franchise)

25:30.170 --> 25:32.340
Darn it, who did this?

25:39.719 --> 25:40.880
It's acetone.

25:50.690 --> 25:51.960
What's with you?

25:57.430 --> 25:59.700
Hey, you can't go inside.

26:02.140 --> 26:03.170
That's me.

26:03.769 --> 26:05.069
I'm the owner.

26:05.769 --> 26:06.779
I see.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.509
I heard there was a fire\Nat the third store too.

26:10.979 --> 26:12.279
It was done\Nin the same way.

26:12.350 --> 26:14.319
Goodness,\Nwho's doing this?

26:14.680 --> 26:17.319
We're trying to find out.\NGive us a bit more time.

26:33.269 --> 26:34.299
Inspector Woo.

26:37.069 --> 26:38.370
There's another fire.

26:58.489 --> 27:00.130
(A musical for families,\N"A Tale of a Turtle")

27:01.160 --> 27:02.930
Hello, Ms. Yoo.

27:02.930 --> 27:05.229
I heard about\Nyour transfer.

27:05.229 --> 27:06.239
Are you stationed here?

27:06.239 --> 27:08.340
Yes, I'm at Joongjin\NPatrol Division Four.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.440
Did someone set\Na motorcycle on fire?

27:10.440 --> 27:11.469
Yes.

27:11.469 --> 27:14.210
Arson cases have been\Nbreaking out recently.

27:14.309 --> 27:16.279
Not all fires are arson.

27:21.350 --> 27:23.150
It's a stolen motorcycle.

27:24.049 --> 27:25.350
How did you know?

27:25.850 --> 27:28.989
No one draws like this on\Na brand new motorcycle...

27:29.059 --> 27:30.329
if it's theirs.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.210
They had fun with this.

27:54.620 --> 27:55.680
It's at least...

27:56.650 --> 27:57.749
three people.

28:00.190 --> 28:02.660
One of them\Nchewed on the filter.

28:03.590 --> 28:06.400
The other one crushed it\Nwith their foot.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.700
The last one threw out\Na half-smoked cigarette.

28:13.969 --> 28:16.069
Then they probably\Nran out of gas.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.809
And they probably took gas\Nfrom another motorcycle.

28:27.319 --> 28:28.719
That happens often.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.120
It's a piece of cake...

28:30.120 --> 28:32.489
to get gas out of this\Nwith a screwdriver.

28:37.660 --> 28:39.029
Darn it,\Ndon't leave me out.

28:39.029 --> 28:40.299
I want a smoke too.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.590
And as they put in\Nstolen gas in here,

29:07.059 --> 29:09.090
they probably\Nspilled a bit.

29:29.380 --> 29:31.380
Hey, give me a smoke.

29:31.650 --> 29:33.150
Darn it, man.

29:33.579 --> 29:34.650
Get lost.

29:37.620 --> 29:38.920
Aren't you hungry?

29:38.920 --> 29:40.289
I'm starving.

29:42.090 --> 29:44.130
- Watch it.\N- What's this?

29:44.590 --> 29:46.360
Hey, get the motorcycle.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.630
Put the fire out.\NPut it out!

29:48.700 --> 29:49.969
Let's just run.

29:49.969 --> 29:52.430
- We can't save that.\N- Let's run.

29:55.569 --> 29:57.410
They had a bad habit of...

29:57.410 --> 29:59.809
throwing out cigarette\Nbutts everywhere.

30:02.779 --> 30:03.950
It's this one.

30:05.279 --> 30:06.350
This one started the fire.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.279
It's a male.

30:09.279 --> 30:10.789
I can tell\Nby these doodles...

30:11.219 --> 30:13.559
that he's between\Nthe age of 16 to 19.

30:13.559 --> 30:16.229
You're right.\NIt says, "Fo sho".

30:16.390 --> 30:19.059
I've seen it often around\Nmiddle and high schools.

30:19.059 --> 30:21.430
I'm sure they got burned.

30:21.499 --> 30:24.499
They're probably at\Nan emergency room nearby.

30:25.430 --> 30:27.739
I'm glad this wasn't\Nserial arson.

30:42.150 --> 30:43.989
I just needed\Na glass of water.

30:45.690 --> 30:49.219
Anthocyanin and\Ncitric acid in this...

30:49.219 --> 30:50.590
will help with\Nyour fatigue.

30:50.590 --> 30:51.660
I see.

31:00.370 --> 31:01.499
That's refreshing.

31:02.870 --> 31:04.809
Did you earn\Nsomeone's grudge...

31:05.009 --> 31:07.739
with your business?\NCan you think of anyone?

31:09.140 --> 31:11.950
I just enjoy baking.

31:16.450 --> 31:17.620
Be careful.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.360
Thank you.

31:23.860 --> 31:24.930
Be careful.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.729
The wind is strong...

31:52.650 --> 31:53.660
Yes?

31:58.329 --> 31:59.329
Where's Lieutenant Ha?

31:59.329 --> 32:00.999
He's investigating\Nan arson case.

32:00.999 --> 32:02.930
Make sure he doesn't\Ndo anything weird.

32:02.930 --> 32:04.200
Like what?

32:06.340 --> 32:08.670
Whatever it is, stop him\Nfrom doing other stuff.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.809
The chief got his\Nstomach cramp back.

32:13.239 --> 32:14.239
Yes, sir.

32:15.979 --> 32:17.150
Mr. Gye.

32:18.809 --> 32:19.850
Yes?

32:24.489 --> 32:26.590
Yesterday,

32:27.160 --> 32:28.860
I edited this part.

32:28.860 --> 32:30.489
I'm curious to find out...

32:30.489 --> 32:31.829
how you changed it.

32:31.829 --> 32:33.400
Right? I thought so.

32:33.400 --> 32:36.900
I knew you'd be curious.

32:43.110 --> 32:44.140
I like it.

32:46.039 --> 32:47.809
How did you know?

32:48.110 --> 32:49.410
How did you know\Nabout the fire here?

32:49.779 --> 32:50.850
You might as well...

32:50.850 --> 32:52.450
become a fortune-teller.

32:52.450 --> 32:53.880
I heard you caught\Nthe serial arsonist.

32:53.880 --> 32:54.950
What? When?

32:54.950 --> 32:56.079
Is it not true?

32:56.350 --> 32:58.620
You looked so free that\NI thought you caught him.

33:01.519 --> 33:03.960
You don't know because\Nyou aren't an officer,

33:03.960 --> 33:06.329
but I'm interviewing\Nthe victim right now.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.660
I'm an honorary officer.

33:08.799 --> 33:09.930
And I am...

33:09.930 --> 33:11.600
a part of\NJoongjin Police Station.

33:11.600 --> 33:12.769
Then you're my junior.

33:16.910 --> 33:19.140
Why are you going around\Nwith that profiler?

33:19.579 --> 33:22.239
Did you want\NMs. Yoo to come alone?

33:22.910 --> 33:24.150
Well, I understand.

33:24.249 --> 33:26.009
You two are close.

33:26.350 --> 33:27.479
You mean us?

33:27.479 --> 33:28.920
We're not close at all.

33:29.950 --> 33:30.950
You two...

33:31.950 --> 33:33.960
are referring\Nyourselves as...

33:33.960 --> 33:35.559
"us".

33:35.559 --> 33:37.360
I do that to everyone.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.759
I did that since\NI was kid.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.160
What's going on?

33:40.660 --> 33:43.769
Inspector Woo and I are\Nworking on serial arson.

33:44.130 --> 33:46.569
We've already solved one,\Nright?

33:48.069 --> 33:50.069
You're not referring you\Nand I as "us".

33:50.309 --> 33:52.140
You said you do that\Nwith everyone.

33:52.309 --> 33:54.009
- What?\N- Just say "us".

33:54.009 --> 33:55.380
This is getting boring.

33:56.650 --> 33:57.650
Do you happen to...

33:57.950 --> 33:59.620
have any enemies?

33:59.749 --> 34:01.150
We're done investigating\Nher already.

34:01.319 --> 34:03.019
I only make cakes.

34:03.019 --> 34:04.789
And I manage this shop.\NThat is all.

34:04.789 --> 34:06.289
I don't know anything.

34:06.289 --> 34:07.660
(Bite Set\N5 pieces, 9 pieces)

34:07.660 --> 34:08.989
I'm not sure.

34:09.460 --> 34:12.630
I think you have an enemy\Nlooking at these prices.

34:12.960 --> 34:16.329
A piece of cake is\N9 dollars 80 cents. Gosh.

34:16.329 --> 34:18.429
I only use good\Ningredients.

34:18.429 --> 34:20.170
It's 100 percent handmade.

34:20.900 --> 34:22.840
It's quite untidy here.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.210
Why don't you go inside\Nto talk?

34:26.340 --> 34:27.639
Oh, gosh.

34:28.139 --> 34:29.539
My goodness.

34:32.079 --> 34:33.920
Who told you to use your\Nphone during work hours?

34:33.920 --> 34:35.380
You're going to get\Nscolded badly.

34:35.849 --> 34:37.449
I'm sorry, sir.

34:37.449 --> 34:38.449
Where is the Sniffer?

34:39.150 --> 34:40.159
He is...

34:50.369 --> 34:51.829
(Joongjin2-dong)

34:54.099 --> 34:55.099
(Joongjin3-dong)

34:55.170 --> 34:56.309
You're good.

34:57.369 --> 34:59.210
You're so good,\NInspector Woo.

34:59.539 --> 35:02.309
Why do you have to\Ndraw it here?

35:04.409 --> 35:06.519
What are you doing?

35:06.519 --> 35:08.479
These are the places where\Nserial arson occurred.

35:08.679 --> 35:10.650
The person who set fire...

35:10.650 --> 35:12.220
in Baebang-dong\Nand Joongjin-dong...

35:12.990 --> 35:14.119
is the same person.

35:16.329 --> 35:18.090
- The suspect is...\N- He's in his early 30s.

35:18.090 --> 35:19.389
It's a guy.\NHe's not married.

35:19.530 --> 35:21.929
There are 3,000 men\Nlike that in this area.

35:21.929 --> 35:24.499
He only sets fire\Nat a certain hour.

35:25.229 --> 35:26.900
He does it in Baebang-dong\Nduring dinner hours.

35:28.369 --> 35:29.809
He does it in\NJoongjin-dong at night.

35:31.010 --> 35:32.409
He's quiet during the day.

35:32.470 --> 35:34.840
He doesn't set fire\Nduring the day.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.510
He's stuck at his work.

35:36.809 --> 35:37.809
Done.

35:54.130 --> 35:56.130
He sets fire...

35:56.130 --> 35:57.630
on his way back home\Nafter work.

35:59.499 --> 36:01.170
He does things\Nup to his mood.

36:01.269 --> 36:04.369
There could be small cases\Nthat weren't reported.

36:05.470 --> 36:07.179
When I judge based\Non his modus operandi,

36:07.340 --> 36:09.079
he's not a meticulous man.

36:09.079 --> 36:10.849
He acts up to his mood.

36:10.849 --> 36:11.979
He could probably regret\Nabout it sometimes.

36:11.979 --> 36:13.550
He could be a\Nsimple-minded man...

36:13.679 --> 36:14.979
who doesn't turn back.

36:18.090 --> 36:19.789
Then the suspect is...

36:23.260 --> 36:24.260
you.

36:25.329 --> 36:26.499
No, I'm not.

36:26.929 --> 36:28.760
I think\Nthe suspect is you.

36:34.570 --> 36:36.940
I'll burn everything down!

36:42.679 --> 36:45.550
I'll burn everything!

36:54.760 --> 36:56.559
What's wrong with her?

36:57.389 --> 36:58.389
She's weird.

36:59.929 --> 37:01.960
There's nothing\Nin between...

37:02.229 --> 37:04.070
Baebang6-dong and\NJoongjin3-dong bus stop.

37:04.199 --> 37:05.570
There was nothing there.

37:05.729 --> 37:08.869
There's one arson between\Nthe bus stop and subway.

37:09.809 --> 37:12.170
So he doesn't get on\Nthe subway.

37:12.170 --> 37:14.210
He rides buses, right?

37:14.240 --> 37:15.240
You're right.

37:20.050 --> 37:22.519
He lives in Joongjin-dong.

37:22.519 --> 37:24.220
He goes to work\Nin Baebang-dong.

37:24.389 --> 37:27.720
He gets home in between\N6pm to 6:30pm.

37:27.720 --> 37:31.389
He gets off at the\NJoongjin3-dong bus stop.

37:33.699 --> 37:35.599
It's good he doesn't\Nget on the subway.

37:36.030 --> 37:37.769
There are so many\Npeople who commute.

37:38.329 --> 37:40.499
We'll go through the bus\NCCTVs first.

37:40.740 --> 37:42.070
Remove those people\Nwho interchange buses.

37:48.010 --> 37:50.849
It's likely that he lives\Nin Joongjin3-dong.

37:50.949 --> 37:52.809
We'll start searching for\Npeople who bought...

37:52.809 --> 37:55.780
cigarettes and acetone\Nwithin Joongjin3-dong.

37:55.780 --> 37:58.050
We can search all the\Nstores, marts, and...

37:58.050 --> 37:59.690
drug stores within the\Nsame region.

38:00.289 --> 38:01.320
Let's include a pharmacy.

38:01.559 --> 38:03.990
Acetone is also sold\Nin the pharmacy.

38:04.130 --> 38:06.900
It works well on\Nremoving dirt in kitchen.

38:18.769 --> 38:21.909
(Arson scenes)

38:37.960 --> 38:39.059
Hi, what's going on?

38:39.900 --> 38:41.260
Is there anything\NI can help?

38:41.760 --> 38:43.670
Nothing except that\Nit smells bad here.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.300
Give me a second.

38:49.170 --> 38:50.240
Hello?

38:52.869 --> 38:54.479
- Really?\N- Excuse me.

38:54.479 --> 38:56.039
What should I work on?

38:57.650 --> 38:59.510
We're not bad people.

38:59.510 --> 39:01.550
It's almost time to go\Nhome. Don't work.

39:01.720 --> 39:02.889
Start tomorrow.

39:04.389 --> 39:06.119
May I...

39:06.559 --> 39:07.659
go home?

39:07.659 --> 39:09.630
Of course. Go home now.

39:12.159 --> 39:13.159
See you tomorrow.

39:14.829 --> 39:16.900
Hi, I'm done. Yes.

39:17.630 --> 39:19.699
I'll see you in 30 minutes\Nin Hongdae.

39:30.349 --> 39:31.409
Where is Detective Ha?

39:32.010 --> 39:33.150
I'm on the phone with him.

39:33.449 --> 39:34.449
Give me that.

39:37.490 --> 39:38.490
What?

39:39.249 --> 39:40.389
You little...

39:40.389 --> 39:42.260
Is it time to play around\Nwith a girl?

39:42.260 --> 39:43.889
We have to work on\Nthe arson case.

39:44.190 --> 39:47.559
Goodness. It's better that\Nyou're working that way.

39:48.699 --> 39:49.699
What?

39:50.570 --> 39:51.999
The profiler\Nof the headquarters?

39:54.900 --> 39:56.070
It's strange.

39:56.670 --> 39:58.909
This fire at the shop\Nnumber four...

39:58.970 --> 40:00.110
is around 3 or 4pm.

40:00.179 --> 40:01.409
It's a day time.

40:01.780 --> 40:03.710
Based on Inspector Woo's\Nprofiling,

40:03.710 --> 40:05.380
it's his working hours.

40:05.449 --> 40:06.820
There could always\Nbe variables.

40:06.820 --> 40:07.849
It could be his holiday,

40:07.849 --> 40:09.650
medical leave, or\Nmonthly leave.

40:09.889 --> 40:10.949
Yes, it could be.

40:12.820 --> 40:14.190
It's so delicious.

40:16.059 --> 40:19.659
Right? I used mint from\NSwitzerland this time.

40:20.130 --> 40:22.599
I'm done with my job.\NI'll go now.

40:22.929 --> 40:24.699
You're not catching the\Nsuspect with us?

40:27.670 --> 40:29.099
I'm a profiler.

40:29.769 --> 40:32.010
Detectives catch suspects.

40:32.409 --> 40:34.880
You're a policeman too.

40:37.949 --> 40:40.119
Please catch him.

40:45.990 --> 40:47.119
He's being silly.

40:51.389 --> 40:52.860
The suspect's\Nin his early 30s...

40:52.860 --> 40:54.300
and works in Baebang-dong.

40:54.300 --> 40:55.559
He's single.

40:55.760 --> 40:57.570
He lives\Nin Joongjin3-dong.

40:57.999 --> 40:59.639
He passes\Nthe Joongjin3-dong...

40:59.639 --> 41:01.139
bus stop every day.

41:01.869 --> 41:03.210
Gosh.

41:03.809 --> 41:06.340
We only have to go through\Nthe CCTVs then.

41:06.340 --> 41:08.340
Mr. Gye is good.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.679
Give him a round\Nof applause.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.650
Please support Team\N3 and 4 along with squad.

41:15.650 --> 41:16.990
I'll make sure to catch\Nthe suspect...

41:17.150 --> 41:19.019
before\Nthe headquarter does.

41:20.360 --> 41:21.360
Great.

41:21.590 --> 41:23.659
I'll support you with it.\NInvestigate it your way.

41:24.229 --> 41:25.490
- Yes, sir. Thank you.\N- Thank you.

41:25.490 --> 41:26.499
Good bye, sir.

41:45.249 --> 41:46.249
What are you doing?

41:46.820 --> 41:50.119
You've upgraded\Nfrom a magnifier.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.420
Of course I have to.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.659
I'm an honorary officer.

41:54.659 --> 41:56.260
Honorary officer, my foot.

41:56.429 --> 41:57.990
You're just a civilian.

42:01.999 --> 42:03.030
Is it good?

42:08.999 --> 42:11.510
He didn't smoke it.

42:13.579 --> 42:15.010
Watch the lady well.

42:15.179 --> 42:16.249
Watch her if she's\Nfooling around.

42:16.579 --> 42:17.579
Yes, sir.

42:21.519 --> 42:24.190
Excuse me.\NYou can't do that here.

42:24.550 --> 42:26.289
Please give me a second.

42:26.289 --> 42:28.389
- Get out.\N- Give me a moment.

42:28.389 --> 42:29.789
- Get out.\N- Hey.

42:29.789 --> 42:30.960
What are you doing?

42:31.990 --> 42:34.159
I told you to watch her.\NDon't touch her.

42:34.699 --> 42:37.369
She's an honorary\Nofficer, all right?

42:45.139 --> 42:47.479
You've all heard it.

42:47.479 --> 42:50.280
Please work under\NUnit One's directions...

42:50.280 --> 42:51.710
from now on.

42:51.909 --> 42:54.150
- Give them the orders.\N- Yes, sir.

42:54.420 --> 42:56.349
Go back to where you were.

42:56.690 --> 42:57.789
Associates,\Nplease stay back.

42:57.789 --> 43:00.090
Please check on the CCTV\Nand dash cam footages.

43:00.090 --> 43:01.190
- You got it, right?\N- Yes.

43:01.190 --> 43:02.389
- Yes.\N- This way.

43:02.389 --> 43:04.030
What are you doing?\NWhat is it?

43:04.030 --> 43:05.360
- What?\N- You're trying to...

43:07.130 --> 43:08.130
You're...

43:10.400 --> 43:12.329
What is it? They are\Nall busy without me.

43:12.769 --> 43:14.340
Come on.

43:14.539 --> 43:17.369
We're the ace team.

43:17.369 --> 43:19.510
So we're giving orders.

43:20.639 --> 43:21.639
Oh, right.

43:22.340 --> 43:24.249
There's something\Nreally important.

43:24.809 --> 43:26.150
Can you do it for me?

43:27.880 --> 43:28.979
What's that?

43:29.690 --> 43:31.590
It's simple.

43:31.590 --> 43:32.920
- You just need...\N- What's this?

43:32.920 --> 43:35.119
a cigarette and acetone.

43:35.559 --> 43:38.530
I'm going to punish...

43:38.530 --> 43:42.130
the trash store, Genoise,\Nwith fire.

43:42.130 --> 43:43.900
Have some cake\Nbefore you go.

43:44.229 --> 43:45.499
(Genoise)

43:47.470 --> 43:48.670
This...

43:49.340 --> 43:50.340
What?

43:51.110 --> 43:52.139
Gosh.

43:55.479 --> 43:58.210
Can't I go in just\Nfor a second?

43:58.210 --> 44:00.249
You need a card key\Nto go in.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.280
I'm...

44:03.050 --> 44:04.619
the honorary\Npolice officer.

44:05.990 --> 44:07.090
I'm sorry.

44:19.869 --> 44:21.369
Why are you still here?

44:21.369 --> 44:23.909
I won't go until\NI catch the culprit.

44:25.070 --> 44:26.940
There she goes again.

44:30.210 --> 44:31.749
Where are you going?

44:32.749 --> 44:34.380
I have an important\Nbusiness to do.

44:41.519 --> 44:43.030
(Our small concern\Nand love will...)

44:43.030 --> 44:44.530
(make a world without\Nviolence and crime.)

44:44.530 --> 44:46.530
People went outside...

44:46.659 --> 44:48.659
to catch the arsonist\Na while ago.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.869
Why are you alone?

44:54.039 --> 44:56.409
I see. You're an outcast.

45:02.809 --> 45:04.909
You're here together.

45:04.909 --> 45:07.380
You should be at the site.\NWhy are you here?

45:07.380 --> 45:08.880
I'm done with my duty.

45:09.619 --> 45:10.820
What's the matter?

45:14.960 --> 45:16.190
The culprit...

45:16.190 --> 45:18.460
set my store on fire\Nas he foretold it here.

45:18.460 --> 45:19.490
Check this out.

45:19.699 --> 45:20.729
(Punishment on Genoise)

45:22.130 --> 45:23.769
It's our third franchise.

45:23.769 --> 45:26.440
Do you know how much\Ntheir cake is?

45:27.139 --> 45:30.340
A whole cake here\Ncosts as much as...

45:30.340 --> 45:32.010
- my daily wage.\N- "Arbiter of Fire"?

45:46.320 --> 45:47.559
(Truck Arson)

45:47.559 --> 45:48.820
(Genoise 3rd Franchise\NArson)

45:49.690 --> 45:50.690
What about the suspects?

45:50.690 --> 45:52.490
We have five suspects who\Nmatch with the conditions.

45:52.490 --> 45:54.199
They all have an alibi.

45:54.199 --> 45:55.860
We might need more time\Nif we expend to...

45:55.860 --> 45:57.499
- day and temporary...\N- Mr. Gye!

45:57.499 --> 45:59.940
We've got a report.

46:00.240 --> 46:03.170
They're videos posted\Non the deep web.

46:03.170 --> 46:05.740
They seem to be highly\Nrelated to this case.

46:05.740 --> 46:06.780
(The deep web is\Nan online space...)

46:06.780 --> 46:07.780
(that can't be searched\Nvia general portals.)

46:07.780 --> 46:09.880
This man\Ncan't park properly.

46:09.949 --> 46:11.579
He parked in front of\Nthe building entrance.

46:11.579 --> 46:13.150
Who's this man with\Nthe mask on his face?

46:13.150 --> 46:15.420
I'm not sure because\Nhe's wearing a mask.

46:15.420 --> 46:18.349
I'll make him never\Ndo this again.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.889
It's his declaration\Nthat he'll start a fire.

46:22.789 --> 46:24.590
You said not to\Nhave prejudices.

46:24.630 --> 46:27.159
Maybe he created these\Nafter the incidents.

46:27.760 --> 46:29.599
I don't think so.

46:29.599 --> 46:31.329
It was midnight.

46:31.670 --> 46:32.900
What about it?

46:33.499 --> 46:34.900
He's saying they\Nwere uploaded...

46:34.900 --> 46:36.269
at midnight\Nbefore the incidents.

46:36.740 --> 46:37.740
Right.

46:39.139 --> 46:41.579
The video list\Nis pretty long.

46:45.610 --> 46:47.820
This man\Ncan't park properly.

46:47.849 --> 46:50.619
He parked in front of\Nthe building entrance.

46:51.420 --> 46:52.690
I'll make him...

46:53.190 --> 46:56.159
never do this again.

46:57.460 --> 46:59.130
The night of the 25th?

46:59.659 --> 47:02.499
Gosh, someone\Nthrew the fire down.

47:05.170 --> 47:06.599
The 27th too.

47:07.769 --> 47:09.400
That darn granny.

47:09.869 --> 47:12.110
She splashed water on me,\Nbut she didn't apologize.

47:12.740 --> 47:14.139
I'll teach her a lesson...

47:14.139 --> 47:16.949
with this quicklime.

47:16.949 --> 47:19.849
Polystyrene may catch\Non fire if it's near lime.

47:19.920 --> 47:22.179
I said it's not me.

47:23.650 --> 47:25.019
He uploads\Na video at midnight...

47:25.019 --> 47:26.519
He starts a fire\Nafter work.

47:26.519 --> 47:29.289
Gosh, Inspector Woo's\Nprofile was right.

47:32.090 --> 47:33.199
Wait a second.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.860
Something was uploaded\Nat midnight today.

47:37.869 --> 47:40.670
Children these days\Nare so rude.

47:40.670 --> 47:43.010
They point fingers instead\Nof greeting politely.

47:43.010 --> 47:44.570
Those filthy kids.

47:45.340 --> 47:48.639
I'll clean them up\Nnice and well.

47:49.679 --> 47:50.780
Gasoline?

47:51.249 --> 47:52.479
Do you want me\Nto put it in here?

47:57.249 --> 47:59.289
You start a small fire.

48:00.059 --> 48:03.090
And you put gasoline\Nnear the fire...

48:03.090 --> 48:06.159
as if it's water.

48:06.190 --> 48:08.429
Then they'll try to put\Nthe fire out with it,

48:08.429 --> 48:10.630
but only cause\Nit to get bigger.

48:12.229 --> 48:13.369
What are you waiting for?

48:13.499 --> 48:15.369
Go catch\Nthat punk right now!

48:15.369 --> 48:17.440
Track his IP address\Nand find out his location.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.269
It's impossible to track\Nhis IP address.

48:19.269 --> 48:20.880
It's the deep web.

48:20.880 --> 48:22.740
Even drug dealing can't\Nbe caught in here.

48:24.280 --> 48:25.409
So...

48:26.210 --> 48:27.920
will you sit back and\Ndo nothing about this?

48:28.780 --> 48:30.519
It's 7pm right now.

48:30.550 --> 48:32.150
It's about time\Nhe got off the bus.

48:32.150 --> 48:34.690
Going to the bus stop\Nwon't help.

48:34.690 --> 48:36.360
Then how should\Nwe catch him?

48:43.769 --> 48:46.300
There she goes with\Nher inference.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.909
("The Hare's Liver")

48:53.110 --> 48:56.380
Gosh, I think I've\Nseen this before.

48:56.380 --> 48:58.679
Try to think hard.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.460
(A musical for families,\N"A Tale of a Turtle")

49:08.460 --> 49:09.460
Right.

49:12.860 --> 49:14.360
The banner.

49:24.740 --> 49:25.769
Run!

49:25.769 --> 49:27.539
He'll move to his target.

49:27.639 --> 49:29.909
- Taxi.\N- Goodness.

49:33.650 --> 49:35.349
Please go to Joongjin\NCulture Center.

49:46.630 --> 49:47.929
Hello?

49:50.570 --> 49:53.599
Your Highness.

49:53.800 --> 49:57.570
The turtle is bringing\Nthe hare right now.

49:59.579 --> 50:01.280
- Where is this place?\N- Goodness.

50:01.280 --> 50:02.679
- Welcome.\N- Hello.

50:02.679 --> 50:04.650
Welcome!

50:46.119 --> 50:47.860
- Oh, no.\N- What?

50:48.119 --> 50:51.760
You didn't bring\Nthe liver with you?

50:56.999 --> 50:58.400
Where is he?

51:00.670 --> 51:01.670
Unit 3. Go to\Nthe 2nd floor...

51:01.670 --> 51:02.670
and report the situation.

51:02.670 --> 51:04.210
Unit 4 and 5.\NSeal this place.

51:04.210 --> 51:05.309
Unit One, follow me.

51:07.840 --> 51:08.979
Where is he?

51:08.979 --> 51:10.979
Wait a second.

51:12.949 --> 51:15.220
You start a small fire.

51:15.320 --> 51:18.119
And you put gasoline\Nnear the fire...

51:18.119 --> 51:20.920
as if it's water.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.519
Somewhere people\Ncan confuse...

51:22.519 --> 51:24.090
gasoline with water.

51:24.090 --> 51:26.400
I'll clean them up\Nnice and well.

51:26.400 --> 51:27.929
"Clean them up\Nnice and well."

51:30.070 --> 51:31.130
A restroom.

51:31.570 --> 51:33.139
It's a restroom\Nfor certain.

51:48.619 --> 51:50.519
Try tearing it.

51:50.519 --> 51:51.590
Like this?

51:52.349 --> 51:53.360
Come here.

51:53.360 --> 51:54.460
Stop.

51:56.789 --> 51:58.929
Look at his hand.\NWhat on earth is that?

51:58.929 --> 52:01.260
- I think he's a monster.\N- Goodness.

52:01.260 --> 52:02.530
What on earth is that?

52:02.530 --> 52:04.229
Maybe he's a zombie.

52:24.019 --> 52:25.720
He's here.

52:27.389 --> 52:28.389
Why are you here?

52:30.460 --> 52:31.530
Lieutenant Ha.

52:32.090 --> 52:34.030
Did you finish putting\Nup the banner?

52:34.929 --> 52:36.269
Are you here to check it?

52:36.269 --> 52:38.070
I'm not that free.

52:39.499 --> 52:41.240
We're here to catch\Nthe serial arsonist.

52:47.179 --> 52:50.780
All right, friends. I'll\Ngive you some break time.

52:50.780 --> 52:52.449
Go to the restroom\Nif you want.

52:52.449 --> 52:55.119
I'll see you again\Nafter 10 minutes.

52:58.190 --> 53:00.619
I want to pee.

53:00.619 --> 53:02.360
Follow me to the restroom.

53:02.490 --> 53:03.630
Does anyone else\Nwant to go?

53:03.630 --> 53:04.659
- Me.\N- Me.

53:04.659 --> 53:05.760
Come out.

53:19.369 --> 53:20.979
The kids are going\Nto the restroom.

53:20.979 --> 53:23.710
- Be careful.\N- Don't move.

53:25.079 --> 53:26.210
Where is that jerk?

53:26.420 --> 53:27.579
We don't know too.

53:54.610 --> 53:55.610
That's...

53:58.179 --> 53:59.820
- Don't.\N- Freeze!

54:03.949 --> 54:05.720
Freeze! That jerk...

54:08.090 --> 54:09.630
The bathrooms' ceilings\Nin buildings like this...

54:09.630 --> 54:11.929
use urethan which is\Neasy to burn.

54:11.929 --> 54:14.030
And the stage\Nis built with wood.

54:14.030 --> 54:16.929
It might lead\Nto a big fire.

54:16.929 --> 54:19.099
Our team is already\Nchecking on it.

54:19.099 --> 54:21.369
- Okay?\N- Sue me if you want.

54:26.280 --> 54:28.309
Guy, are you okay?

54:28.409 --> 54:30.880
There's smoke\Ncoming from below.

54:31.449 --> 54:32.679
Ma'am!

54:33.220 --> 54:35.650
Ma'am, please help us.

54:35.650 --> 54:37.150
What? What's going on?

54:39.220 --> 54:40.320
You must have\Ntaken the gas in.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.229
Guys, don't come near.

55:00.380 --> 55:01.380
Be careful!

55:01.510 --> 55:03.409
Get out quickly. Get out!

55:03.749 --> 55:04.749
It's dangerous!

55:04.749 --> 55:06.320
Kids, let's get out!

55:13.420 --> 55:14.420
Excuse me.

55:14.420 --> 55:16.389
Excuse me! Please\Nhelp these kids here.

55:18.360 --> 55:19.360
Come with me.

55:23.499 --> 55:24.599
Detective Ha.

55:25.199 --> 55:26.440
Are you okay?

55:28.999 --> 55:30.309
Detective Ha.

55:32.070 --> 55:33.380
Are you okay?

55:35.240 --> 55:36.409
Detective Ha!

55:37.010 --> 55:39.249
Why would you just yell\Nwhen you're not coming in?

55:39.479 --> 55:40.479
Are you okay?

55:42.019 --> 55:43.150
Are you okay?

55:43.389 --> 55:45.190
Hey, hey.

55:45.920 --> 55:46.920
Sergeant Yuk.

55:55.099 --> 55:57.070
It won't do you any good\Nif you get bitten by him.

55:58.099 --> 55:59.740
There will be another\Nchance, so wait.

56:02.699 --> 56:04.269
Gosh, seriously.

56:06.809 --> 56:07.940
Detective Ha.

56:08.940 --> 56:10.210
Are you okay?

56:10.210 --> 56:11.849
I'm okay.\NIt's all over now.

56:15.579 --> 56:18.349
- He must be the culprit.\N- He's the one.

56:18.349 --> 56:19.720
What are you all here\Nto see?

56:19.720 --> 56:21.820
He's the one who set\Nfire on my place.

56:21.820 --> 56:23.389
- Is that the guy?\N- You jerk!

56:23.389 --> 56:25.490
- You shameless jerk!\N- You scumbag!

56:25.490 --> 56:27.130
- What a jerk.\N- That scumbag.

56:28.599 --> 56:29.929
How could he be\Nso shameless?

56:29.929 --> 56:30.999
You scumbag.

56:30.999 --> 56:32.099
It's a relief\Nthat he got caught.

56:32.099 --> 56:33.369
Serve more than\N10 years in prison!

56:33.639 --> 56:35.699
- Goodness.\N- That ruthless jerk.

56:35.699 --> 56:36.940
He needs to learn\Na lesson.

56:36.940 --> 56:38.010
Hey, you spy!

56:40.240 --> 56:42.179
You shouldn't live\Nyour life like that.

56:44.610 --> 56:45.979
We're a team, remember?

56:46.619 --> 56:48.079
And I'm your team leader.

56:48.650 --> 56:49.690
I'll let you go\Nfor investigating...

56:49.690 --> 56:50.849
before reporting to me.

56:50.849 --> 56:51.949
It's your first time\Nafter all.

56:53.360 --> 56:54.360
See you tomorrow.

57:02.829 --> 57:03.900
Are you okay?

57:04.570 --> 57:07.440
What kind of people\Nare they?

57:08.869 --> 57:10.470
Anyway, we caught\Nthe suspect.

57:10.869 --> 57:12.170
We also stopped him from\Nsetting the place on fire.

57:12.170 --> 57:13.210
That's all I'm asking for.

57:15.610 --> 57:16.650
Detective Ha.

57:17.909 --> 57:19.210
Are you okay?

57:21.979 --> 57:25.420
My cake shop will be\Nokay from now on, right?

57:25.849 --> 57:26.889
Of course.

57:27.460 --> 57:28.690
Thank you.

57:31.429 --> 57:32.929
Oh, gosh.

57:33.699 --> 57:35.300
- Gosh.\N- What's this?

57:35.300 --> 57:36.869
- My goodness.\N- What's happening?

57:37.729 --> 57:39.639
Hey, get back\Nto the station.

57:41.139 --> 57:42.869
You have done\Nnothing wrong.

57:43.139 --> 57:44.539
You must've answered\Nbecause you were asked.

57:44.909 --> 57:46.510
- Well...\N- Get going now.

57:50.280 --> 57:52.449
So I guess there won't\Nbe any fire anymore.

57:53.150 --> 57:55.280
You seem to be\Nworried about me a lot.

57:57.920 --> 57:59.050
Oh, the shopping bag.

57:59.960 --> 58:01.960
My spinach must have\Nall withered away!

58:01.960 --> 58:03.059
What? Are you shy?

58:04.490 --> 58:06.300
She's quite fast.

58:11.829 --> 58:13.670
What a tough day.

58:13.670 --> 58:15.039
Gosh, I'm tired.

58:19.979 --> 58:21.579
How relaxing.

59:09.490 --> 59:11.329
There's someone else\Nbesides Na Jin Tae.

59:14.460 --> 59:15.499
There are...

59:17.300 --> 59:18.499
more than\Njust one culprit.

59:29.380 --> 59:31.880
I won't ever be caught.

59:32.610 --> 59:35.849
The judgment of fire\Nwill continue.

59:36.590 --> 59:38.889
And the next target...

59:39.559 --> 59:41.420
is that garbage detective,

59:41.860 --> 59:45.460
Ha Wan Seung.

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.630
(Name: Kim Chang Seok,\NOccupation: Lawyer)

01:01:02.099 --> 01:01:03.740
(The suspects)

01:01:05.539 --> 01:01:06.940
(Queen of Mystery 2)

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.010
Get it done smoothly.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:11.409
Is it necessary\Nto kill him?

01:01:11.409 --> 01:01:13.349
It will cause a problem\Nlater if we don't.

01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:16.019
Is there something\NI need to do?

01:01:16.019 --> 01:01:18.090
He just copied Na Jin Tae.

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:19.720
He's a diligent copycat.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.659
He even copies what seems\Nunnecessary.

01:01:21.659 --> 01:01:23.559
I'm getting a hunch.

01:01:23.659 --> 01:01:25.329
If he's not home yet...

01:01:25.329 --> 01:01:26.659
That means he's going to\Nset it on fire.

01:01:26.659 --> 01:01:28.559
The 4th Genoise store\Nwas the 1st to be on fire.

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:29.900
The next was your house.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.800
And the next target\Nwas the truck.

01:01:32.199 --> 01:01:33.300
Be careful!
