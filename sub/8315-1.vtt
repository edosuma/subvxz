WEBVTT

02:18.847 --> 02:20.007
Honey?

02:21.015 --> 02:22.175
Hi.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.106
These for me?

02:32.193 --> 02:33.524
Pretty.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.860
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.195
| fixed your favourite.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.821
Would you like to open the wine?

02:41.911 --> 02:43.071
Sure.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.528
It's a great year.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.869
Sorry I'm late.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.535
Where were you? l was getting worried.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.881
Some hot-shot tracker
today brought in a big order

02:53.965 --> 02:56.502
of spark plugs and percussion caps.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.255
99% of which were all bunged up.

02:59.387 --> 03:03.050
Rusted pure orange. Rusted like carrots.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.051
Bon appetit.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.800
So do you.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.056
Thanks.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.062
You're welcome, Sam.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.866
Do you know that rust
is an electrochemical process?

03:28.249 --> 03:29.455
Electrochemical?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.658
Yeah. I just learned this.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.916
I learned something today, too.

03:36.049 --> 03:40.292
What do these have in common,
lightning rods, Fig Newtons, escalators,

03:40.386 --> 03:42.502
ballpoint pens and Vaseline?

03:43.181 --> 03:44.717
Vaseline?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.344
I don't know, I give up.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.801
They're all invented by Americans.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.974
Who invented Vaseline?

03:59.405 --> 04:00.736
Dessert?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.115
Yeah.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.039
Cherry?

04:17.840 --> 04:20.627
What's wrong, honey? You okay?

04:25.765 --> 04:26.971
Kiss me.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.760
Cherry?

06:17.126 --> 06:19.583
Well, she sure took a lot of water.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.292
Can you fix her?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.250
I'm sorry, kid.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.172
Total internal meltdown.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.509
They don't come any finer than this.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.849
Level of response, sensitivity.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.771
It's a thing of the past. I'm sorry.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.642
What about her chip?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.943
Well, you know I wouldn't
let you get away without that.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.941
You've got her basic memory right here.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.243
Her vocal patterns,
reflex action, personality.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.236
They don't make them like this anymore.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.536
You do know how rare and valuable this is?

07:02.463 --> 07:04.624
Yeah. I know.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.375
I know how it is. You're like me.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.464
You're a romantic.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.921
Most of these birds,
they come in here, they don't care.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.051
It's all apple pan dowdy to them.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.387
But you and l, we both know
each one of these honeys is special.

07:20.481 --> 07:24.144
Got her own special magic,
her own special way. Isn't that true?

07:27.071 --> 07:28.686
Let me show you something. Come here.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.781
Got to face it, Sam, this is 2017.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.656
Even the best tracker
couldn't find a Cherry in these parts.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.486
Well what am I going to do, Slim?

07:37.582 --> 07:38.992
It's a Cherry or nothing.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.914
Just let me show you a couple of things.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.584
Now, this is our Bambi 14 model.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.252
Brand-new, never been used.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.421
Coming up is our Cindy 990.

07:47.508 --> 07:51.296
Strictly domestic, actually.
Housework, taxes, things like that.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.511
Below the waist, no man's land.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.638
Now, if I read you correctly,

07:55.725 --> 07:59.183
I think you're looking
for something with a little more spunk.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.307
Spunk isn't exactly the word.
It's more a kind of...

08:02.398 --> 08:04.184
Intangible.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.902
Step down for a minute
and gaze upon perfection,

08:06.986 --> 08:10.149
craftsmanship, disk drive, pelvic roll.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.771
This is when Detroit still cared.

08:11.866 --> 08:12.946
Sam?

08:13.409 --> 08:14.649
Sam?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.623
Sam.

08:27.924 --> 08:31.257
Look, give me a little time.
I'll check around.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.251
That's all I can do.

08:38.809 --> 08:42.768
With unemployment down to 40%,
the nation rounds the corner.

08:42.855 --> 08:46.564
Salvage and recycling centers
are paving the way for the future.

08:47.151 --> 08:49.733
Just as our grandfathers' generation did,

08:49.820 --> 08:53.563
workers today need to
think twice before throwing things away.

08:53.658 --> 08:58.618
Toaster ovens, steam irons, blow dryers.
Whole families are pitching in.

08:59.163 --> 09:03.702
The result is plain to see.
A new life for household appliances...

09:06.212 --> 09:10.956
Sectors 19 and 3
are still experiencing periodic shortages.

09:11.050 --> 09:15.293
Please check your area
for any serviceable manufacturing points.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.799
The red zone is for magnesium
and silo-carbide recyclables only.

09:20.893 --> 09:24.260
Please have your reclamation
credit form ready for processing.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.524
Sambo!

09:30.611 --> 09:31.646
Hey, Bill.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.692
Sam.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.111
5:00, champ. Closing time.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.358
We're heading for the Glu Glu Club.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.859
What say you tag along?

09:36.951 --> 09:38.031
No, thanks.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.609
- Hey, drinks are on Bill.
-Hey, wait a minute.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.945
What's the matter, Sam? You look kind of
pale, you pale or something?

09:42.039 --> 09:43.245
I hate the Glu Glu Club.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.788
- We can go somewhere else.
-The Kwik Kat Club.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.536
- Bimbo's.
-The Wink Wink. The Dotted Line.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.128
They're all the same.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.419
Actually, see, Bill's got
a hot date with Amy Meemur.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.495
Amy who?

09:51.591 --> 09:52.751
Bitch on wheel.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.628
He's been trying
to land that fish for five weeks.

09:54.802 --> 09:58.044
Come on guys,
you know I'm gonna be dead weight.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.846
Stand by, stand firm.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.548
Strength in numbers.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.808
You guys go on, I've got to stay here

10:04.895 --> 10:07.477
and straighten out this
extension cord situation, sector five.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.562
Sector five?

10:08.649 --> 10:09.889
Sector five's a lost cause.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.438
Hey, pack it in and have a drink, pal.
Working too hard.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.893
Have two drinks.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.487
So your robot is gone, pal.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.690
Why don't you try some real women?

10:18.826 --> 10:21.442
Take five. Take 10.
Get away from the plant.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.404
Okay. Let's do it.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.124
This is it, Sam. Flesh and blood.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.750
All you've got to do is a little paperwork,

10:33.841 --> 10:35.923
some song and dance,
and then you're home free.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.717
Women, Sam. Real women.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.155
Amy Meemur.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.329
Looks hot. Let's get it down on paper.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.338
You stick your tongue in my client's mouth
and I'm gonna sue your ass off.

11:19.428 --> 11:20.884
Deal breaker.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.466
Hi.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.059
This is me and Steve.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.522
I think that's Steve...

11:33.984 --> 11:36.236
Yeah.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.859
I met him here last month.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.657
You're really something.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.912
Don't you have something to show me?

11:50.418 --> 11:51.282
Actually, no.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.659
What?

11:52.795 --> 11:54.660
My card's expired.

11:54.755 --> 11:55.665
I'm sorry.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.460
What in the hell's the matter with you?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.759
I mean, what are you doing
if your card's expired?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.503
I'm sorry.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.427
Of all the stupidest goddamn things.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.509
Asshole!

12:18.988 --> 12:22.230
Okay. Let's see.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.653
Talking about
a standard one-night arrangement, right?

12:25.786 --> 12:27.868
I guess. Yeah.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.742
Right, so we'll say a dinner,
complete sexual encounter,

12:30.875 --> 12:33.366
full penetration, optional
episode in the morning, right?

12:33.461 --> 12:34.541
Just slow down.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.368
You know, I personally thought it'd be nice.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.079
Let me see this.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.673
My lawyer better see this one.

12:41.802 --> 12:45.841
For instance, the oral clause
here seems a little sticky.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.214
It's a minor point,
we can work it out in bed.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.968
Hey, you work it out in bed,
'cause I'm not gonna be there!

12:52.271 --> 12:54.307
No deal, no feel!

13:08.329 --> 13:09.660
Hi, honey.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.617
These for me? Pretty.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.539
You hungry? I fixed your favourite.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.210
I learned something today, too.

13:21.300 --> 13:25.384
What do these have in common,
lightning rods, Fig Newtons, escalators,

13:25.471 --> 13:27.587
ballpoint pens and Vaseline?

13:30.184 --> 13:31.674
Dessert?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.531
I'm sorry, kid. Total internal meltdown.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.620
Bingo, Sam, [heard
of a tracker who'll go into Zone 7.

13:52.790 --> 13:56.157
He'll get you a Cherry, same make right
down to the year and model number,

13:56.252 --> 13:57.492
right down to the eyelashes.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.577
You stick in her memory chip,
and you got your girl back

13:59.672 --> 14:01.128
exactly the way you had her before.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.794
Now, there's a tracker bar
out of Glory Hole.

14:03.884 --> 14:07.001
Drive out there,
find a tracker named Johnson.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.678
Good luck, Sam. You're gonna need it.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.185
I'd like a room for the night.
The name's Treadwell.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.733
That'll be $1.50 for the night.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.823
We run clean place, we like things quiet.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.993
The rule is, you can't
bring robots in after 11:00.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.069
All right.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.906
We got big selection
of Freds and Johns and Marilyns,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.377
so you don't have to
go dragging no-one in here.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.084
Have you got any Cherries?

16:09.426 --> 16:10.541
Cherries?

16:11.679 --> 16:13.294
Where you come from?

16:38.205 --> 16:40.321
Jeez! Not again.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.958
Damn thing's busted.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.833
Whatever happened
to pride in workmanship?

17:39.433 --> 17:40.923
Hello?

17:56.116 --> 17:57.617
Anybody here?

18:07.544 --> 18:08.795
Better be good.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.620
I want to talk to E. Johnson about a job.

18:11.715 --> 18:12.875
Who are you?

18:13.008 --> 18:15.920
Sam Treadwell from Anaheim.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.967
l'm E. Johnson.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.727
Excuse me.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.355
I think I made a mistake.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.608
What the...

18:37.741 --> 18:39.982
I grew up in the Zone, mister.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.703
I've been a guide in the
territory since I was a kid.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.782
I can distinguish between poisonous
and non-poisonous reptiles

18:47.876 --> 18:49.662
and I know the roads.

18:50.170 --> 18:54.163
| used to ride with Six-Fingered
Jake when he had all his digits.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.632
He used to be
the best tracker in the business.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.135
Maybe I was a bit rash.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.512
Now, what is it you want?

19:07.104 --> 19:08.514
Not so fast.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.728
She's a Cherry 2000.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.278
I want you to go
into Zone 7 and get me one just like her.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.742
This isn't a dating service.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.577
I thought you never say no.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.245
I haven't yet.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.541
l'm paying 500 for the job, 200 upfront.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.924
It's been sort of a dull week.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.806
Hope you don't mind traveling at night.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.134
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

19:48.228 --> 19:50.605
We'd have more fun
chewing on razor blades

19:50.689 --> 19:53.431
than dribbling around
the Zone in broad daylight.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.390
What do you mean "we"?

19:55.527 --> 19:58.143
I'm not going anywhere.
I hire you to go in, that's the deal.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.194
You bring her back, you get paid.

20:00.282 --> 20:05.072
Those robot chassis are kept in the worst
part of the Zone. We call it the graveyard.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.695
Now, maybe
I can get in there and find this thing,

20:07.789 --> 20:12.203
but I need somebody riding shotgun in
order to make it out in one piece.

20:13.253 --> 20:17.587
Forget it.
Think I'll find this guy, Six-Fingered Jake.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.748
Who are you?

20:53.877 --> 20:56.254
My name's Treadwell. Sam Treadwell.

20:56.713 --> 21:00.331
I'm looking for a tracker.
A guy named Six-Fingered Jake.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.924
Could you tell me where I could find him?
I've got a job for him.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.421
Jake's dead.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.797
Lester caught him out in Zone 7
and cut off his hands.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.798
And then he bled to death.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.559
Where you from, mister?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.053
Anaheim.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.083
Rum. 151.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.838
And a crawler.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.598
Two bits, Anaheim.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.076
Maybe I can help you out, mister.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.331
You a tracker?

22:20.422 --> 22:23.255
I do odd jobs. Name's Stacy.

22:23.633 --> 22:27.922
This is Earl. He's visiting from Adobe Flats.
Sit down.

22:28.055 --> 22:30.387
Have a drink and a doughnut.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.091
What did you want to see Jake for?

22:39.149 --> 22:42.232
Don't worry about Earl.
He's deaf as a doorknob.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.563
I'm looking for someone to go into Zone 7.

22:47.657 --> 22:48.863
Zone 7?

22:49.242 --> 22:50.493
That's right.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.654
What is it you want in there?

23:06.927 --> 23:10.294
My, my. Is that a Cherry?

23:10.430 --> 23:11.715
Cherry 2000.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.305
Va-voom!

23:16.770 --> 23:19.352
Know where you can find one like her?

23:19.606 --> 23:22.643
That all depends on how much
you're willing to spend.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.520
Just the chassis.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.657
You got the money on you now?

23:34.287 --> 23:36.323
Maybe I do.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.951
Maybe I don't.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.166
Okay.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.710
Ead?

23:43.797 --> 23:45.662
You stay here.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.127
Me and Mr. Treadwell
gonna go talk to Jake.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.963
Six-Fingered Jake?

23:51.638 --> 23:53.048
Jake's alive.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.347
He just don't like publicity.

23:57.477 --> 23:59.559
Yeah, Zone 7's a tough place.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.853
You should see the way
they carry on out there.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.397
People staying up all night playing Twister,

24:04.484 --> 24:06.896
reverting to their animal natures.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.693
So where are we going?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.816
I'm taking you to see Jake.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.614
Well, where is he?

24:12.701 --> 24:14.316
He's dead.

24:16.496 --> 24:17.997
Drop the gun.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.332
I didn't mean you, weevil-brain!
Now, pick that up.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.285
God, you make me sick!

24:26.047 --> 24:29.005
And the cartridges, too, while you're at it.

24:33.221 --> 24:35.678
I thought he couldn't hear too well.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.259
| read lips.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.508
Got the money on you, Sam?

24:40.645 --> 24:41.760
What about the chip?

24:41.855 --> 24:43.265
Lester's gonna want that chip.

24:43.398 --> 24:45.229
Shut up, Earl! Search him.

24:57.078 --> 24:59.740
Jesus! Get up! Get off of me!

25:02.501 --> 25:04.116
Earl, you chicken head!

25:15.388 --> 25:18.380
Hey, Johnson. I've been thinking it over.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.302
You got the job.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.229
That's what I figured.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.444
Get in.

25:37.786 --> 25:41.449
Okay, let's just get
a few things straight, Treadwell.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.326
I do the tracking.

25:43.416 --> 25:46.624
You just sit there and don't touch anything.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.540
Fine. Let's just get out of here.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.754
How can you see?

26:33.842 --> 26:35.878
I mean, how can you see to drive?

26:35.969 --> 26:37.960
I drive by feel, mostly.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.465
"By feel"?

26:40.557 --> 26:41.842
Mostly.

27:05.665 --> 27:08.077
What the hell are you doing?
What's wrong?

27:08.209 --> 27:09.164
Why did we stop?

27:09.252 --> 27:10.332
Put this on.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.580
Don't you wear one?

27:12.172 --> 27:14.037
Might mess up my hair.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.830
Are you lost?

27:15.925 --> 27:17.631
- I think we're lost.
-Mister, I would appreciate it

27:17.719 --> 27:19.880
if you would just
shut up until we get to the barricades.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.427
- All right?
-What barricades?

27:21.514 --> 27:23.175
Just keep your head
down low and try not to get shot.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.514
Oh, great.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.081
Hang on.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.640
Friends of yours?

28:15.735 --> 28:18.147
Bunch of freaks out on the edges.

28:18.738 --> 28:21.946
They got nothing to do, they're bored,
they just want a little action.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.068
It's real mature.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.094
Have a nice nap?

29:27.807 --> 29:29.263
Where are we?

29:30.101 --> 29:31.716
Okay, we're about right here.

29:32.812 --> 29:35.303
And the robot graveyard is over here.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.980
I figure eight hours of driving

29:38.109 --> 29:40.316
will get us to the yard
about 4:00 in the morning.

29:40.403 --> 29:43.236
Gives you about 15 minutes
to find your doll.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.403
15 minutes?

29:44.491 --> 29:45.526
At the most.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.073
There'll be sirens screaming,

29:47.160 --> 29:50.698
patrols everywhere, dogs, you name it.
The whole shooting match.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.404
The trick is to time it just right

29:52.499 --> 29:54.740
so that we can make it out
while it's still dark.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.870
You make it sound so easy.

29:56.961 --> 30:00.294
You stand watch. I'm gonna get some rest.

30:00.715 --> 30:05.175
Wait a minute. You expect me
to sit around here when we're so close?

30:05.261 --> 30:07.377
Why don't you let me drive
while you sleep?

30:07.472 --> 30:10.384
No way, mister. Nobody drives my car.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.929
Go hum a little tune or something.

30:13.019 --> 30:16.762
Count your lucky stars, read a book.
I don't care.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.687
Just don't go walking around.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.061
Yeah, I'll hum a little tune.

30:24.531 --> 30:28.274
Unbelievable. "Nobody drives my car."

30:57.313 --> 30:58.894
I love you, Sam.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.441
I'm so lucky to be with you.

31:09.492 --> 31:10.777
Kiss me.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.998
That's nice.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.578
What do you want me to do?

31:21.588 --> 31:23.294
Okay, move closer.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.462
Yes.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.545
That feels good.

31:27.844 --> 31:31.086
Yes, yes. Here. Faster, faster.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.884
Is that your hand?

31:35.810 --> 31:37.846
Let me help you with that.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.262
I like that.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.431
Faster, faster, yes.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.611
I thought I told you to stay put.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.077
Next time you wander off like that

32:42.168 --> 32:44.159
I'm going to leave you behind
for the buzzards.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.876
Is that a threat or a promise?

32:48.341 --> 32:49.751
lt's Lester.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.340
Who's Lester?

32:51.928 --> 32:56.718
He's sort ofjudge, jury and executioner
out here. A total wacko.

32:58.559 --> 33:01.266
He and his gang control Zone 7.

33:01.354 --> 33:02.685
What's he doing here?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.262
Good question.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.359
Please, don't kill me!

33:23.251 --> 33:25.663
Come on. We're gonna take a little detour.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.084
Good idea.

33:52.822 --> 33:56.314
It's just one more day.
Don't look so broken-hearted.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.585
Her eyes are red dots.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.547
That's from the flash.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.757
That's where the red comes from.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.300
If I took a picture of you
the same thing would happen.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.511
Why would you wanna
take a picture of me?

34:22.643 --> 34:24.508
I said "if."

34:24.812 --> 34:26.018
"If."

34:27.273 --> 34:29.434
If only I had red eyes.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.707
Are we lost?

34:52.799 --> 34:55.711
Relax. I been this way 100 times before.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.544
What is that?

35:00.306 --> 35:01.716
It's a crane.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.510
I can see that.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.891
I mean, what's it doing out here?

35:05.978 --> 35:07.138
Nothing...

35:07.230 --> 35:08.436
Yet.

35:15.988 --> 35:18.695
Well, we're wasting time. Let's get going.

35:18.783 --> 35:23.493
Hold your horses. You're
paying me to do a job, not drive a bus.

35:24.038 --> 35:26.279
So leave the tracking to me.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.615
Fine. I'll get some sleep.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.871
I wouldn't get too comfortable.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.419
More barricades?

35:33.506 --> 35:35.713
This ain't nothing like the barricades.

35:50.857 --> 35:53.439
Les, we've got a situation here.

35:53.776 --> 35:57.564
An unidentified white male
and that red-headed tracker

35:57.655 --> 36:00.237
just blasted their way into the Zone.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.945
That is unauthorised, Brad. Waste them.

36:03.035 --> 36:04.286
I can't wait anymore.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.782
Randa, I do like your personality.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.197
Hope you're not afraid of heights.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.464
Magnet attached.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.008
I don't believe this.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.753
It's the best way to cross the river.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.010
Don't tell me,

37:09.101 --> 37:11.478
you've been this way 100 times before.

37:16.150 --> 37:17.356
Target in position.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.151
Get ready.

37:33.125 --> 37:36.583
You know how to use it? We'll go on three.

37:36.879 --> 37:39.256
One, two, three.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.488
Buck, dump them in the river.

38:11.163 --> 38:12.198
Ten-four.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.625
Give me a rope.

38:22.717 --> 38:23.832
You got it.

38:24.719 --> 38:27.085
Time to take out the operator.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.256
Right.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.632
I'm hit!

38:36.856 --> 38:37.891
Be careful.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.514
Keep me covered.

38:53.581 --> 38:56.869
Put on your seat belt.
Things are gonna get a bit rough.

39:14.477 --> 39:15.557
Wish me luck.

39:15.644 --> 39:17.054
You're
cr
az
y!

39:34.622 --> 39:35.828
You all right?

39:39.418 --> 39:40.999
Swallowed my gum.

39:46.425 --> 39:49.417
Hurry up! Give me your hand.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.680
You always work this way?

39:55.976 --> 39:58.467
Yeah, but it's never been this easy.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.221
Never say no, huh?

40:07.113 --> 40:09.695
I hope you know what you're doing!

40:33.013 --> 40:35.390
Okay, Treadwell, end of the line.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.053
Great. What's next?

40:47.903 --> 40:50.064
We got to hoof it from here.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.487
Hey, wait!

40:52.908 --> 40:54.944
Got to get my stuff.

41:06.088 --> 41:07.624
I can't see the bottom.

41:08.632 --> 41:10.623
Don't worry, it's down there.

41:13.429 --> 41:16.045
Look out!

41:16.140 --> 41:17.220
Watch it!

41:46.212 --> 41:47.998
Good move up there.

41:51.425 --> 41:53.131
Hope you can swim.

41:53.886 --> 41:56.127
It's a little late to be asking that!

42:12.947 --> 42:14.027
He with you?

42:14.156 --> 42:15.316
Client.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.198
You all right?

42:18.327 --> 42:20.739
Yeah. Just taking a little dip.

42:22.581 --> 42:24.492
It's good to see you.

42:26.710 --> 42:27.825
Yeah.

42:28.420 --> 42:30.581
I almost shot your friend.

42:30.673 --> 42:33.164
This is Sam Treadwell from Anaheim.

42:34.927 --> 42:36.542
Good to see you.

43:05.082 --> 43:08.245
Hi, honey. Did you have a nice day?

43:08.460 --> 43:09.791
Pretty.

43:13.632 --> 43:17.500
What are the women like in big towns?
You have any idea?

43:17.595 --> 43:19.460
You mean like Anaheim?

43:21.181 --> 43:22.921
Yeah. Like Anaheim.

43:23.684 --> 43:27.552
Well, it's all sort of
paranoid and audio-visual.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.349
Nobody has it easy.

43:30.482 --> 43:33.724
People meet in bars
and use everything they got.

43:34.153 --> 43:38.362
All kinds of legal
mumbo-jumbo, demo reels,

43:38.991 --> 43:40.947
under-the-counter drugs.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.780
It's just bad, that's all.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.698
No way I'd put up with that.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.076
Well, shoot, E.

43:52.171 --> 43:55.709
How's these fellas
gonna find out about your 101 charms?

43:57.009 --> 44:00.422
Well, anyone with any brains
would just figure it out.

44:00.512 --> 44:01.501
Yeah.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.724
Where'd you find Mr. Handsome?

44:08.562 --> 44:09.927
It's a job.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.226
I liked you better in them other duds.

44:13.317 --> 44:14.898
This is how I usually dress.

44:17.696 --> 44:21.154
Where'd you get all those boxes back
there? Those toaster ovens.

44:21.283 --> 44:24.616
I found them with some rubbish
out this side of Reno.

44:25.746 --> 44:27.077
They all work?

44:27.164 --> 44:30.577
Well, what'd I be doing with
them if they didn't work?

44:30.834 --> 44:33.541
Toast is just the beginning
with your new toaster oven.

44:33.796 --> 44:37.505
You can make open-faced
sandwiches, baked potatoes,

44:37.633 --> 44:39.043
and best of all,

44:41.053 --> 44:43.760
the tray's removable for easy cleaning.

44:44.598 --> 44:46.179
Look at that.

44:48.268 --> 44:51.101
Ain't nothing like it for cooking rattler.

45:27.933 --> 45:30.265
You're Six-Fingered Jake, aren't you?

45:32.062 --> 45:33.643
He is, isn't he?

45:36.942 --> 45:38.682
Well, what if I am?

45:39.945 --> 45:43.108
Nothing. ljust heard a lot about you.

45:43.365 --> 45:44.605
Like what?

45:44.742 --> 45:46.323
I heard you were dead.

45:47.494 --> 45:49.405
Retired's more like it.

45:50.956 --> 45:53.823
I've been trying to create a serene outlook.

46:00.966 --> 46:04.379
You gonna tell me what you
and Speed are doing out here?

46:04.470 --> 46:08.008
Just going into the yard
to get one of those sex robots for Sam.

46:08.098 --> 46:10.840
His old one broke down
from over-exertion, it sounds like.

46:10.976 --> 46:13.433
- It wasn't like that.
-It wasn't?

46:13.562 --> 46:16.804
"Are you all right? Here, lay your head here.

46:16.899 --> 46:18.639
"Is that your hand?"

46:18.817 --> 46:20.682
We talked. I could talk to her.

46:20.944 --> 46:23.560
Yeah, right. "Faster, faster..."

46:23.655 --> 46:26.567
You can never understand
with that tiny Neanderthal brain of yours.

46:26.700 --> 46:28.406
At least I have a brain.

46:37.169 --> 46:40.502
There was tenderness.
A dream-like quality about her.

46:41.340 --> 46:42.500
There was romance.

46:42.633 --> 46:43.463
Romance?

46:43.550 --> 46:44.460
Yeah, romance!

46:44.593 --> 46:46.174
With a robot!

46:46.887 --> 46:49.845
I mean, we are talking about
a robot, aren't we?

46:53.185 --> 46:55.267
She isn't just a robot.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.666
Maybe I know what you mean, Speed.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.715
and that's a rare thing these days.

47:32.391 --> 47:35.428
But there's a lot more
to love than hot wiring.

49:03.106 --> 49:04.892
- Morning.
-Good morning.

49:06.902 --> 49:08.062
Catch anything?

49:08.153 --> 49:09.313
Couple of carp.

49:19.456 --> 49:21.242
So we moving in here, or what?

49:23.835 --> 49:26.497
Got to wait till dark to flush out my Ford.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.586
I'd rather be chewing on razor blades

49:28.715 --> 49:31.707
than piddling around
the Zone in broad daylight!

49:55.993 --> 49:58.075
Treadwell, you in position?

49:58.370 --> 50:00.235
Hold on to your horses.

50:06.586 --> 50:07.837
I love you.

50:22.185 --> 50:25.973
We're going down the tube in two minutes.
Careful up there.

50:54.634 --> 50:58.172
Treadwell! You all right? Treadwell!

51:37.177 --> 51:39.714
Elaine? Is that you?

51:39.805 --> 51:44.219
Hi, Sam. I changed my name.
I changed it to Ginger.

51:45.477 --> 51:48.344
You look great. It's good to see you again.

51:52.317 --> 51:54.649
Do you think you could help me with this?

51:56.905 --> 51:58.395
What are you doing here?

51:58.490 --> 52:00.105
| live here. Thanks.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.906
This is Zone 7, right?

52:01.993 --> 52:04.905
You guys! This is my old boyfriend, Sam.

52:04.996 --> 52:06.372
Now scoot, huh?

52:06.456 --> 52:08.742
We got some catching up
to do, right, Sam?

52:08.875 --> 52:10.536
Vamoose.

52:10.627 --> 52:14.211
Come on, boy. Sit by the pool.
Tell me what you've been doing.

52:14.297 --> 52:16.458
Listen.

52:16.550 --> 52:19.087
l was with someone
and we got shanghaied.

52:19.177 --> 52:21.839
The next thing I know, I wake up here.

52:22.222 --> 52:23.962
Was anyone found with me
when l was brought here?

52:24.057 --> 52:25.217
I don't know anything about it.

52:25.350 --> 52:28.683
Les said you were the only one left alive.

52:31.690 --> 52:35.854
Sam, I just love it out here.
The city was just so much bull.

52:36.319 --> 52:38.696
I'm a whole different person now.

52:38.780 --> 52:40.816
| feel so secure.

52:40.907 --> 52:45.617
| feel focused like I've never felt before.

52:45.954 --> 52:48.036
Elaine, I told you
l was with someone! Can't...

52:48.123 --> 52:50.330
I said I changed my name!

52:50.417 --> 52:54.410
Can't you respect that?
Can't you listen when | talk to you?

52:56.131 --> 52:58.338
You haven't changed a bit, Sam.

52:59.551 --> 53:03.635
We can't have any negative
energy around this place, I mean...

53:03.722 --> 53:06.008
Les isn't gonna put up with it.

53:08.602 --> 53:10.558
- Lester?
-That's him now.

53:15.567 --> 53:18.479
Try not to get in the way, Sam.
I've got to go change.

53:18.570 --> 53:21.186
Don't be so negative.
Lester's very sensitive.

53:55.315 --> 53:58.273
A lot of bullets, a lot of guns, a lot of...

53:59.736 --> 54:01.727
Yeah, but we handled it.

54:17.796 --> 54:19.332
Sam.

54:19.422 --> 54:20.958
This is Lester.

54:23.051 --> 54:26.259
How's it going, Sam?
Good to see you on your feet.

54:26.346 --> 54:27.381
Donny!

54:28.640 --> 54:31.131
You heard the man. Get up. Let's go.

54:31.726 --> 54:35.218
This here's Jim Sneak. The boys found him
asleep in that broken-down cart.

54:35.313 --> 54:36.689
Case of sunstroke.

54:36.815 --> 54:40.228
Skeet. The name's Skeet.

54:40.652 --> 54:43.189
Said he was headed for Elko,
but he got lost.

54:43.321 --> 54:44.902
I still am lost.

54:47.659 --> 54:49.149
See you later.

54:52.539 --> 54:54.655
Well, supper's almost ready.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.999
Gentlemen! Don't goof up.
One grenade will get you all.

54:58.503 --> 55:01.461
Keep a close eye on
these prisoners, soldier.

55:21.192 --> 55:23.604
Nature is the great provider.

55:24.112 --> 55:26.319
I do like fresh pods.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.231
- Chris?
-Yes, sir.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.532
Thank you, Lester.

55:30.702 --> 55:32.363
Sam?

55:33.413 --> 55:35.028
Do you work out?

55:36.750 --> 55:38.206
- No.
-Well, you should.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.166
You've got the frame for it. Trim.

55:40.253 --> 55:42.369
Got to watch what you eat, though.
Diet's important.

55:42.464 --> 55:44.295
Man's got to watch what he eats.

55:44.424 --> 55:45.880
Now, we got a program here,

55:45.967 --> 55:48.925
diet, exercise, mental discipline.

55:49.721 --> 55:53.009
I like to see people reach
their full potential.

56:01.191 --> 56:02.727
Recognise her?

56:07.906 --> 56:10.898
That's a Cherry 2000.

56:10.992 --> 56:14.325
I've got a passel of them in the yard, but...

56:14.412 --> 56:18.997
Can't find the right kind of chip
to make 'em work, to get 'em to go.

56:19.918 --> 56:23.786
Boy, get one of these
fired up, it's like slammin' an octopus.

56:30.428 --> 56:32.760
- How you doing down there, Sneak?
-Oh...

56:32.847 --> 56:34.803
That bird too cooked for you?

56:34.933 --> 56:38.471
| just don't like to eat heavy
before a big tournament.

56:38.561 --> 56:41.018
What did you say
you were doing in these parts, anyway?

56:42.107 --> 56:47.067
l was on my way to Elko.
Gonna play in the Elko Classic.

56:48.154 --> 56:51.692
I've been meaning
to ask you something else, too, Sneep.

56:52.283 --> 56:54.535
How is it my boys found these

56:54.619 --> 56:57.861
firearms smoking in your bags
when they picked you up?

56:57.956 --> 57:01.039
| just carry that for protection, you know?

57:01.292 --> 57:02.372
Protection.

57:02.460 --> 57:06.544
What about all those dry cell
batteries underneath your front seat?

57:08.299 --> 57:11.462
You're a tracker, aren't you, Jimbo?

57:12.804 --> 57:15.261
Now, wait a minute.

57:15.390 --> 57:18.723
We got a policy against
trackers in these parts.

57:20.812 --> 57:23.599
And I can never tolerate lying in any form.

57:26.401 --> 57:27.481
Chet?

57:46.588 --> 57:47.577
Ah, ah, ah!

57:51.801 --> 57:53.666
Slip that on your head.

57:54.929 --> 57:55.793
What?

57:55.930 --> 57:57.761
Put that on your face.

58:06.774 --> 58:07.980
Thanks.

58:17.660 --> 58:20.197
Don't tear that now. John, help him out.

58:24.125 --> 58:25.331
Now what?

58:27.629 --> 58:31.668
What's going on?
What are you doing with my hands?

58:40.183 --> 58:41.263
Help!

58:42.185 --> 58:43.550
Help!

58:56.991 --> 58:58.731
What are you guys doing?

58:59.410 --> 59:00.866
Hell!

59:00.995 --> 59:03.247
I've got too much club for this dude.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.456
Make it a hole in one!

59:10.588 --> 59:12.328
Let me out of here.

59:16.302 --> 59:17.417
Fore!

59:34.237 --> 59:37.525
You do the hokey pokey
and you turn yourself around

59:37.615 --> 59:40.778
That's what it's all about Hey!

59:40.868 --> 59:44.281
You put your right arm in
You put your right arm out

59:44.372 --> 59:47.739
You put your right foot in
And you shake it all about

59:51.671 --> 59:53.787
That's what it's all about

59:55.383 --> 59:56.463
Sam.

1:00:06.644 --> 1:00:08.475
Les really likes you, Sam.

1:00:08.563 --> 1:00:11.396
It's great the way you have
this rapport with him, right off the bat.

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:13.890
The man is a psychopathic killer.

1:00:14.652 --> 1:00:17.394
Don't impose your values on me, Sam.

1:00:17.488 --> 1:00:21.106
A lot of the people,
I'll admit it, they're flakes,

1:00:21.492 --> 1:00:24.108
but that's why we need
somebody like you, Sam.

1:00:24.203 --> 1:00:26.489
Someone to pull in the slack.

1:00:27.707 --> 1:00:29.663
You're not listening to me, Sam.

1:00:29.834 --> 1:00:31.119
No. No, no.

1:00:31.544 --> 1:00:33.330
I'm listening,

1:00:33.421 --> 1:00:34.661
Ginger.

1:00:35.173 --> 1:00:37.710
I am. But I can't stay here.

1:00:44.807 --> 1:00:48.766
There's three kinds
of barbed wire fencing us in here.

1:00:48.853 --> 1:00:52.892
There's mines further out.
No real water to speak of.

1:00:53.566 --> 1:00:56.103
I think you should just stick around.

1:00:56.194 --> 1:00:58.185
Give this place a chance.

1:01:04.369 --> 1:01:07.611
Lester's gonna bring you in
on a training session in the morning.

1:01:07.997 --> 1:01:09.157
Great.

1:01:09.374 --> 1:01:11.786
So I think you better get some sleep.

1:01:11.876 --> 1:01:13.036
Okay.

1:01:13.336 --> 1:01:14.872
Goodnight, Sam.

1:02:04.512 --> 1:02:06.343
- Nice night.
-ls that right?

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:08.505
Yeah, just

1:02:08.599 --> 1:02:10.135
taking a walk.

1:02:10.226 --> 1:02:12.342
You know, admiring the stars.

1:02:14.647 --> 1:02:17.263
There's Orion. Right there, see?

1:02:27.034 --> 1:02:28.444
What the...

1:02:28.953 --> 1:02:30.489
Did you miss me?

1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:31.820
Come on.

1:02:34.292 --> 1:02:35.657
What happened to you?

1:02:35.752 --> 1:02:38.459
Tracked you here on a mule. Took a while.

1:02:40.673 --> 1:02:42.379
ls Jake dead?

1:02:42.467 --> 1:02:43.752
Not yet.

1:02:54.353 --> 1:02:56.139
What happened to the other burro?

1:02:56.230 --> 1:02:58.312
They shot him in the heart.

1:03:02.361 --> 1:03:04.226
Sorry about your gear.

1:03:08.034 --> 1:03:09.820
What are you doing?

1:03:10.495 --> 1:03:14.488
Let's just get out of here.
You got about 60 seconds.

1:03:20.755 --> 1:03:24.043
Edith, where did you get
that little go-to-hell hat?

1:03:24.133 --> 1:03:25.293
Foundit

1:03:25.384 --> 1:03:26.635
Yeah.

1:03:26.719 --> 1:03:31.053
I'm gonna circle around
the back and I'll meet you at Snappy Tom's.

1:03:31.265 --> 1:03:35.554
Here, darling. I don't
want you to be lonely, so you take this.

1:03:36.854 --> 1:03:40.187
And you let me know
how things turn out, will you?

1:03:41.984 --> 1:03:44.191
You ease up there, Uncle John.

1:04:22.608 --> 1:04:23.859
Go, go, go!

1:04:23.943 --> 1:04:25.308
About time.

1:04:38.165 --> 1:04:39.496
Red alert!

1:04:43.004 --> 1:04:45.120
Les, watch out for the bees!

1:04:55.808 --> 1:04:58.094
Well, you've won your spurs.

1:04:58.895 --> 1:05:00.055
Yeah.

1:05:15.536 --> 1:05:20.200
I told him to stay, Les. I explained
everything and l encouraged him to stay.

1:05:24.337 --> 1:05:28.706
Ginger, have the girls fix some sandwiches.

1:05:31.469 --> 1:05:32.925
Yuck!

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:52.479
Why are you looking so glum?

1:05:54.659 --> 1:05:57.321
I lost Cherry's chip back on that mule.

1:06:03.668 --> 1:06:06.284
Kind of wipes out
the whole deal, doesn't it?

1:06:07.088 --> 1:06:10.080
I mean, we could still
break into the yard and get Cherry,

1:06:10.174 --> 1:06:13.291
but then it'd be just like
a toaster or something.

1:06:13.427 --> 1:06:15.167
Her whole personality's on that chip.

1:06:15.262 --> 1:06:18.254
You can't separate personality
from the rest of it.

1:06:18.349 --> 1:06:20.010
At least, I can't.

1:06:23.145 --> 1:06:26.353
Well, we can turn around
and go back after we meet up with Jake.

1:06:26.524 --> 1:06:28.731
Then you'll get a full refund.

1:06:29.068 --> 1:06:32.811
I don't care about the money.
I never cared about that.

1:06:58.055 --> 1:06:59.511
Nelson! Dix!

1:06:59.598 --> 1:07:00.883
Yes, sir.

1:07:03.102 --> 1:07:04.808
I want you to chase
those birds till they drop.

1:07:04.895 --> 1:07:06.635
Don't kill them,
just hold them till I get there,

1:07:06.731 --> 1:07:08.096
do you understand?

1:07:08.190 --> 1:07:11.148
We'll get the vehicles
fixed as soon as we can.

1:07:11.235 --> 1:07:12.520
We're counting on you men.

1:07:12.611 --> 1:07:15.148
Keep the sun out of your eyes
and be yourselves.

1:07:46.896 --> 1:07:48.102
Whoa!

1:08:03.662 --> 1:08:05.072
Are you okay?

1:08:05.706 --> 1:08:08.243
Yeah, ljust bumped my head.

1:08:09.210 --> 1:08:11.997
- I wasn't watching.
-Where are we, anyway?

1:08:13.839 --> 1:08:15.830
Are you sure you're okay?

1:08:18.677 --> 1:08:21.589
No. I mean, yeah.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:26.258
| just feel really groggy and hot.

1:09:17.361 --> 1:09:19.022
Hi, honey.

1:09:20.281 --> 1:09:23.193
These for me? Pretty.

1:09:23.534 --> 1:09:26.651
You hungry? I ﬁxed your favourite.

1:09:26.745 --> 1:09:30.078
Where were you? I was getting worried.

1:09:30.166 --> 1:09:32.452
I learned something today, too.

1:09:34.420 --> 1:09:36.001
Why didn't you tell me?

1:09:36.088 --> 1:09:38.545
I don't know. I'm sorry.

1:09:40.885 --> 1:09:43.001
You lied to me.

1:09:43.095 --> 1:09:46.007
You say a lot of things about Cherry,
but she never lied.

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:48.927
Yeah? Well, I'm not a fucking machine.

1:09:55.608 --> 1:09:57.314
Great. Lester's guys.

1:10:28.182 --> 1:10:29.843
| feel better now.

1:10:50.913 --> 1:10:52.449
Get in the car.

1:10:52.831 --> 1:10:54.571
Where are we going?

1:10:55.125 --> 1:10:57.867
To the robot graveyard,
where do you think?

1:10:57.962 --> 1:11:00.044
I mean, that's what
you hired me for, isn't it?

1:11:00.172 --> 1:11:01.673
That's right.

1:11:01.799 --> 1:11:03.630
That's what you really want.

1:11:04.927 --> 1:11:05.882
Yeah.

1:11:07.137 --> 1:11:08.513
Damn right.

1:11:16.272 --> 1:11:18.137
Want one of these now?

1:11:48.971 --> 1:11:50.552
Hurry up, Randa.

1:12:13.412 --> 1:12:15.073
Check out the hut.

1:12:52.701 --> 1:12:54.032
Drop it.

1:12:56.246 --> 1:12:57.497
Turn around.

1:12:58.415 --> 1:12:59.746
You drop it, sugar.

1:12:59.833 --> 1:13:01.243
You drop it, red.

1:13:01.752 --> 1:13:03.583
Drop your gun, Snappy.

1:13:04.088 --> 1:13:06.295
Well, Jake! Dogs and cats.

1:13:06.423 --> 1:13:07.378
I heard you was dead.

1:13:07.716 --> 1:13:08.796
Not yet.

1:13:10.177 --> 1:13:12.759
I'm sorry. I didn't recognise you, E.

1:13:12.930 --> 1:13:14.010
Randa, honey, you know Jake.

1:13:14.098 --> 1:13:15.133
- Hi, Randa.
-Hi.

1:13:15.224 --> 1:13:16.339
This here's E. Johnson.

1:13:16.433 --> 1:13:17.673
- Hi, Randa.
-Hi.

1:13:17.768 --> 1:13:19.508
And I don't know who this young man is.

1:13:19.603 --> 1:13:21.969
Sam Treadwell. From Anaheim.

1:13:22.064 --> 1:13:23.645
How you getting on out here, Randa?

1:13:23.732 --> 1:13:25.313
I miss the beach.

1:13:25.401 --> 1:13:27.312
Yeah, well, Randa here's
gonna fix us some lunch,

1:13:27.403 --> 1:13:28.813
ain't you, Randa?

1:13:29.113 --> 1:13:30.148
No.

1:13:30.781 --> 1:13:33.693
Well, then you can just go shit in your hat.

1:13:34.743 --> 1:13:37.906
| wish you wouldn't say
them dirty words, Snappy.

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:41.906
Forget it, Johnson.
Don't even think about it.

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:42.989
There's no way.

1:13:43.085 --> 1:13:47.670
It's easy. We fly over the mines,
we drop into the yard. In and out.

1:13:47.756 --> 1:13:50.463
Forget it. Just fix the car.

1:13:50.634 --> 1:13:52.215
Look, I flew one of these
in the border wars.

1:13:52.302 --> 1:13:54.042
This one's shot to hell.

1:13:54.179 --> 1:13:57.967
Do you think you could
manage to take the plugs out of my Ford?

1:13:58.725 --> 1:14:00.852
What are you trying to prove?

1:14:02.312 --> 1:14:04.223
I'm just doing myjob.

1:14:04.314 --> 1:14:07.397
You can't fix this.
You need a whole new engine.

1:14:08.152 --> 1:14:11.144
Look at yourself. You're a mess.

1:14:11.613 --> 1:14:14.980
Well, we can't all
be glamor pusses 24 hours a day.

1:14:31.675 --> 1:14:32.790
Randa?

1:14:32.926 --> 1:14:35.338
Randa, honey, this is Les.

1:14:35.429 --> 1:14:38.546
Lester? Snappy Tom here, Lester.

1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:40.096
Everything's just fine.

1:14:40.184 --> 1:14:44.348
Snappy, I 'm looking for a shabby little
individual who burned down Sky Ranch.

1:14:44.438 --> 1:14:47.646
He escaped in an orange
custom-jobby Ford. He ain't alone.

1:14:47.774 --> 1:14:52.108
If they show up, hold them until I get there.
I want them alive.

1:14:52.196 --> 1:14:57.156
Hi, Lester, they're here. Three of them
plus a donkey. They're fixing that old...

1:14:57.242 --> 1:14:59.949
Blow this off! We got new co-ordinates.

1:15:11.381 --> 1:15:12.587
Stupid.

1:15:21.642 --> 1:15:24.884
lt'll never run. No way.

1:15:38.659 --> 1:15:40.695
You afraid of dying, Speed?

1:15:42.412 --> 1:15:45.825
I can't say that I think about it
too much these days.

1:15:46.708 --> 1:15:50.451
Well, the way I got it figured,
when your time comes,

1:15:50.546 --> 1:15:52.707
my time, your time...

1:15:54.258 --> 1:15:58.001
It's like you turn into
a little part of the world.

1:15:58.929 --> 1:16:01.295
Wind, maybe.

1:16:04.476 --> 1:16:05.556
Yeah.

1:16:06.937 --> 1:16:09.428
A little stream of wind.

1:16:11.358 --> 1:16:12.723
Maybe so.

1:16:13.151 --> 1:16:16.439
Well, sometimes I feel like
I know the whole story.

1:16:18.657 --> 1:16:23.993
Then other times
| feel like it's completely out of control.

1:16:48.604 --> 1:16:51.061
They've got that damned plane working.

1:16:51.148 --> 1:16:53.764
Go get the macaroni and cheese, Randa.

1:17:09.082 --> 1:17:10.743
Lunch!

1:17:16.256 --> 1:17:17.757
Tell E to come to lunch.

1:17:17.841 --> 1:17:19.001
Right.

1:17:24.431 --> 1:17:26.763
Great. You fixed the plane!

1:17:26.850 --> 1:17:28.260
Yeah, well, forget it.

1:17:28.769 --> 1:17:32.057
Lester and the guys
from the motel are making a beeline for us.

1:17:32.147 --> 1:17:34.103
Go tell Jake we're leaving.

1:17:35.942 --> 1:17:37.022
Jake!

1:17:37.736 --> 1:17:40.603
Jake! Those guys from the motel are
almost here. We got to clear out!

1:17:40.697 --> 1:17:42.688
You and Edith go on ahead, l'll...

1:17:54.795 --> 1:17:56.035
Hold it!

1:17:58.215 --> 1:18:00.877
Get those legs moving. Let's hurry up.

1:18:25.909 --> 1:18:27.240
Mount up.

1:18:32.916 --> 1:18:34.281
Jake's dead.

1:18:35.877 --> 1:18:37.037
What?

1:18:37.421 --> 1:18:41.084
That girl shot him in the back. He's dead.

1:18:56.857 --> 1:18:58.563
Get rid of that.

1:19:14.750 --> 1:19:17.992
I don't... I don't like what I feel.

1:19:18.086 --> 1:19:19.371
| feel anger.

1:19:19.463 --> 1:19:21.374
l'm experiencing anger, Snappy.

1:19:21.465 --> 1:19:23.706
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Lester.

1:19:23.842 --> 1:19:26.128
You told me the plane couldn't fly.

1:19:26.219 --> 1:19:27.720
That was my understanding, yeah.

1:19:27.804 --> 1:19:30.671
Frankly, I don't know how she did it.

1:19:30.766 --> 1:19:34.133
But, I got one of them.
One of them's dead, right there.

1:19:34.436 --> 1:19:36.301
Yeah, I told you I wanted them alive.

1:19:36.396 --> 1:19:37.556
- Alive?
-Yeah.

1:19:37.689 --> 1:19:43.275
Well, sometimes things don't
always turn out like we want.

1:19:45.155 --> 1:19:46.986
I thought I saw something in you, Snappy.

1:19:47.073 --> 1:19:49.564
I thought I saw potential.

1:19:49.659 --> 1:19:52.116
Hey, Lester, I've been
waiting for you all week.

1:19:52.204 --> 1:19:53.319
I'm busy, Randa.

1:19:53.413 --> 1:19:55.870
Hey, look at my new sandals. You like 'em?

1:19:55.957 --> 1:19:57.367
Tell her to go back inside.

1:19:57.501 --> 1:20:00.208
Randa, go inside, Randa.

1:20:00.337 --> 1:20:02.453
Hey, wait. Listen, Lester.

1:20:02.547 --> 1:20:06.039
About the guys in the plane, they're going
into the yard, I overheard them.

1:20:06.134 --> 1:20:09.092
You know, if we hurry up,
we can catch up to them.

1:20:09.179 --> 1:20:11.841
Oh, my God. What happened to your face?

1:20:15.894 --> 1:20:18.010
You need to work at your personality.

1:20:26.071 --> 1:20:28.687
Sorry, Snappy. Move out!

1:20:28.782 --> 1:20:29.897
Yes, Lester.

1:20:30.033 --> 1:20:31.534
Come on, let's go.

1:20:43.380 --> 1:20:47.464
E, let's just turn around
and call the whole thing off.

1:20:47.551 --> 1:20:49.462
- It's too late for that.
-No, it's not.

1:20:49.594 --> 1:20:52.301
I've got to believe
I've been doing a job here.

1:20:52.430 --> 1:20:54.591
You take that away and then what?

1:20:54.724 --> 1:20:56.976
What did Jake get shot up for?

1:22:25.815 --> 1:22:27.066
Sure we'll find a Cherry?

1:22:27.150 --> 1:22:28.390
Follow me.

1:22:30.195 --> 1:22:33.312
Where are the patrols, dogs?
You said there'd be dogs.

1:22:33.406 --> 1:22:35.067
How should I know?

1:22:42.290 --> 1:22:44.497
Unload! Let's move back there!

1:22:59.724 --> 1:23:01.009
Hurry up!

1:23:02.102 --> 1:23:04.889
Remember, gentlemen.
Life is an adventure.

1:24:12.839 --> 1:24:15.205
This is it. Make it quick.

1:24:59.385 --> 1:25:00.716
Me and the boys gonna take this on foot.

1:25:00.804 --> 1:25:02.840
You wait in the jeep. I'll be right back.

1:25:02.931 --> 1:25:04.637
What about these sandwiches?

1:25:04.724 --> 1:25:07.807
It's not good to go out in this heat
on an empty stomach.

1:25:13.274 --> 1:25:15.139
Ringo, Squid, keys.

1:25:28.414 --> 1:25:31.326
Now, listen, I want them alive, you guys.
Check the robot room first.

1:25:31.417 --> 1:25:35.160
Be friendly yet firm
and don't break anything. Especially you.

1:25:35.255 --> 1:25:36.995
- Move out.
-All right.

1:25:37.215 --> 1:25:38.204
Ringo.

1:25:39.467 --> 1:25:41.503
How about you and me
check that skylight, huh?

1:25:41.594 --> 1:25:43.380
- Okay.
-Okay, let's go.

1:25:53.064 --> 1:25:54.349
This one?

1:25:55.525 --> 1:25:57.140
Close, not quite.

1:26:02.740 --> 1:26:03.991
Hey.

1:26:06.077 --> 1:26:08.534
Get on down there. Now!

1:26:38.902 --> 1:26:41.143
Do l have to tell you to hurry?

1:26:58.379 --> 1:26:59.710
Hi, honey.

1:27:34.958 --> 1:27:36.744
I told you to hurry.

1:27:37.210 --> 1:27:38.791
Where are we going?

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:39.955
We're going home.

1:27:42.632 --> 1:27:44.372
Cherry, let's go.

1:27:53.893 --> 1:27:55.133
Pretty.

1:27:55.770 --> 1:27:57.135
They're up there!

1:28:08.324 --> 1:28:09.734
Come on, Cherry.

1:28:10.952 --> 1:28:12.158
Who are those guys anyway?

1:28:12.245 --> 1:28:13.530
Just come on. Hurry!

1:28:26.009 --> 1:28:27.294
Get down!

1:28:32.307 --> 1:28:35.049
Honey, I'd really
rather be watching this on television.

1:28:36.352 --> 1:28:37.558
Keep down!

1:28:38.354 --> 1:28:39.730
You ready?

1:28:39.814 --> 1:28:40.929
On three.

1:28:41.566 --> 1:28:43.807
One, two, three.

1:28:54.996 --> 1:28:56.532
Let's get out of here.

1:29:01.044 --> 1:29:01.829
Come on, E!

1:29:07.050 --> 1:29:08.290
Come on.

1:29:11.637 --> 1:29:12.922
Lester.

1:29:25.651 --> 1:29:26.902
Come on.

1:29:48.716 --> 1:29:50.172
Start her up!

1:30:13.491 --> 1:30:14.856
Come on, baby.

1:30:21.332 --> 1:30:22.993
We're too heavy.

1:30:28.214 --> 1:30:31.297
There! The plane! Don't let them get away!

1:30:34.137 --> 1:30:37.095
Slow down when you pass
the garbage and I'll jump out.

1:30:37.181 --> 1:30:38.216
What?

1:30:38.307 --> 1:30:41.799
You go on, myjob's done. I'll be all right.

1:30:41.894 --> 1:30:43.225
Forget it!

1:30:43.688 --> 1:30:46.100
Just hold on. I've almost got it.

1:30:55.324 --> 1:30:56.860
We made it!

1:31:13.217 --> 1:31:15.879
The tracker! There she is!

1:31:20.516 --> 1:31:24.225
Squid! Janey! Thejunk pile!

1:31:44.081 --> 1:31:45.457
I love you.

1:31:49.879 --> 1:31:51.289
I love you.

1:32:33.756 --> 1:32:34.836
Shooﬂ

1:33:02.451 --> 1:33:04.737
Cherry, I want you to get me a Pepsi.

1:33:04.829 --> 1:33:05.944
Sure.

1:33:12.795 --> 1:33:14.126
A Pepsi?

1:33:19.927 --> 1:33:21.758
Come on, E! Come on!

1:33:23.848 --> 1:33:26.635
Get those legs moving. Let's hurry it up!

1:33:40.781 --> 1:33:43.488
What about her? She was the whole point.

1:33:43.951 --> 1:33:45.532
She's a robot.

1:34:19.862 --> 1:34:21.818
Ginger, what are we gonna do now?

1:34:21.947 --> 1:34:23.608
You guys want some sandwiches?

1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:25.690
Lester's dead.

1:34:27.036 --> 1:34:29.027
Well, no sandwich for him.

1:34:41.926 --> 1:34:43.211
Pretty.
