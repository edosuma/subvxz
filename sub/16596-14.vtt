00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:05.172 --> 00:06.372
Dude! I just heard the car!

00:06.374 --> 00:07.773
Oh, they're home!

00:07.775 --> 00:11.176
Okay, okay. Liv
just had throat surgery.
Don't act nervous,

00:11.178 --> 00:13.345
'cause it's gonna freak her out.
But don't act like, not nervous,

00:13.347 --> 00:17.383
because then... you know...
that'll make her think
we don't care, you know what?

00:17.385 --> 00:18.717
You can't handle this.
You should go.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.953
-Yeah. Yeah, you're right,
I am a mess.
-Yeah.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.557
Hey, how did it go?

00:25.559 --> 00:29.695
She can't speak yet,
but the doctor said
the surgery went very well.

00:31.999 --> 00:37.569
Having surgery on my vocal nodes
was the scariest day
of my entire life.

00:37.571 --> 00:41.040
And after a few weeks,
I was allowed to talk again.

00:41.042 --> 00:43.342
And then the long road
to recovery began.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.578
(groaning)

00:49.016 --> 00:53.352
Seriously? When I do this
with chopsticks at a restaurant,

00:53.354 --> 00:55.687
you make me go sit in the car.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.991
This is an exercise
to strengthen Liv's vocal cords.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.192
Mmm.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.761
(groaning)

01:02.763 --> 01:07.266
It was weeks and weeks
of really hard work,
and I still had no idea

01:07.268 --> 01:09.768
if I'd ever be able
to sing again.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.004
The doctor said
that there was no guarantee

01:12.006 --> 01:16.075
that my voice would ever
be the same.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.680
Liv, we have some exciting news.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.116
But the doctor says
you should not strain
your voice,

01:24.118 --> 01:26.118
so I brought Joey here
to squeal for you.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.456
My high-pitched birdy voice
is finally useful.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.959
What's going on?

01:33.961 --> 01:39.698
Some producers want to meet
with you about starring
in a Broadway musical!

01:39.700 --> 01:42.401
(Joey squealing)

01:42.403 --> 01:48.273
Wait, Broadway?
That's my dream. I don't even
know if I can sing yet.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.944
The doctor says you are ready
to try to sing. So I scheduled
a session for you

01:51.946 --> 01:53.879
with Tracy Okahatchee.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.148
(Joey squealing)

01:56.150 --> 02:02.754
See? See, I don't even know
who Tracy Okahatchee is,
but it sounds super exciting.

02:02.756 --> 02:07.392
Tracy Okahatchee
is the top vocal coach
in the world.

02:07.394 --> 02:10.629
(exhales)
I guess it's time for me
to try to sing again.

02:10.631 --> 02:16.335
-I'm gonna sing again!

All right, scientists!

03:09.957 --> 03:13.058
You've reached the final four
of Mars Madness!

03:13.060 --> 03:15.627
Welcome to BOOMS.
My name is Parker.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.297
And I'm Val. We're Team Pal!

03:18.299 --> 03:19.898
I thought that you hated
that name.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.633
A girl can change her mind.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.405
Mars Madness is a contest
to find future astronauts.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.740
The winners get to spend
next school year

03:28.742 --> 03:30.509
in a Mars bio-dome.

03:30.511 --> 03:34.546
This national competition
has been whittled down
to the top four teams.

03:34.548 --> 03:39.384
And now Parker and I
are going to whittle it down
to one.

03:39.386 --> 03:43.222
Well, like the one meaning us.
I hope that's obvious.

03:43.224 --> 03:46.091
I'm better at science
than bragging.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.194
There are only three teams here.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.896
Where's the team
from the Midwest?

03:50.898 --> 03:53.599
(keytar fanfare)

03:58.105 --> 04:02.274
Hello... I'm Artie Smalls,

04:02.276 --> 04:07.212
and welcome to my coronation,
soon to be losing teams.

04:07.214 --> 04:10.549
Ready
for a scientific beatdown,
Parker?

04:10.551 --> 04:15.687
And... long-haired
teen sidekick girl?

04:15.689 --> 04:19.024
Parker's my sidekick,
loofah-head!

04:21.128 --> 04:25.063
So Artie... which one
of your minions is your partner?

04:25.065 --> 04:29.568
Ms. Karsch, announce my partner!
(snaps fingers)

04:29.570 --> 04:32.070
You did not just snap at me!

04:32.072 --> 04:35.874
Sorry, please
announce my partner.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.278
Our final participant,
Evan Poulos.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.180
(kazoo fanfare)

04:43.584 --> 04:44.883
-Evan?
-Hey!

04:44.885 --> 04:47.452
You're with Artie?

04:47.454 --> 04:51.957
You left me. And having
my bestie move away
limited my social options.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.892
I've kept
this translucent-skinned boy

04:53.894 --> 04:56.995
out of the sun
and in my shadow.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.798
I'm a minion now.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.336
We're gonna win this contest
and go to the red planet,

05:04.338 --> 05:07.839
where our hair
provides natural camouflage.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.644
Team-Ginger-for-the-win burn!

05:15.282 --> 05:19.685
Oh... kay. Who's ready
for an ice cream sundae bar?

05:19.687 --> 05:22.854
Dibs on tutti-frutti!

05:24.625 --> 05:29.127
Evan's my friend.
But to achieve my dream,
I have to beat him.

05:29.129 --> 05:32.664
Evan might be your friend,
but he is here to win.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.966
He's a dream-killing assassin!

05:34.968 --> 05:40.539
Parker, Parker, Parker!
They have rainbow sprinkles!
This party's gonna be bananas!

05:40.541 --> 05:42.441
Which they also have!

05:44.778 --> 05:48.947
Okay, he's adorable.
But you still
have to destroy him.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.819
(Willow laughing)

05:53.821 --> 05:56.188
Well, thanks again
for coming, Willow.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.123
-You were hilarious.
-Thank you.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.524
My friend
is a stand-up comedian.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.994
You get paid to be funny.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.564
Like a birthday party clown.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.399
(meows)

06:07.401 --> 06:12.971
(gasps)
Oh... hi, little cutie pie.

06:12.973 --> 06:18.577
Hi, come here.
Do you need a home?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.679
Yes, I do.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.614
Okay!

06:23.684 --> 06:25.016
Oh.

06:25.018 --> 06:31.123
He shall be known as
Dwayne "The Kitty" Johnson.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.594
Yeah, uh, Dwayne's a girl.

06:35.596 --> 06:42.667
Oh. Okay.
Well, then,
she'll be known as Stacy.

06:45.739 --> 06:51.943
Some lemon tea for the throat
before Tracy Okahatchee
gets here, and you sing,

06:51.945 --> 06:53.945
for the first time
since surgery.

06:53.947 --> 06:57.749
I'll just sit over here quietly.

Okay, Mom, Mom, Mom.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.960
I'm super nervous.
I won't know until I sing
if my voice is the same,

07:08.962 --> 07:11.730
and I kinda don't want anyone
in the room in case it isn't.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.599
-So...
-Oh! Sure.
Very well.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.802
I'll leave you with the tea
that I brought you...

07:16.804 --> 07:18.603
and the throat

Liv Rooney, Tracy Okahatchee
is here to heal your voice.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.785
I see music in your eyes
that is dying to be released
from your mouth.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.253
Are you ready to sing, girl?

07:35.255 --> 07:37.889
I am! And Ms. Okahatchee,
thank you so much--

07:37.891 --> 07:40.625
Oh, hush! Send me
a gift basket.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.462
I like chocolate and cashews.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.664
-Now, let's get started.
-Oh!

07:45.666 --> 07:49.434
Ah! Your neck is as tight
as a lasso on a guinea hog.

07:49.436 --> 07:52.070
Please repeat:
big, broccoli, bushels.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.905
-Big, broccoli, bushels.

-Pickle, pizza, pepperoni.
-Pizza, pepperoni,
pizza pickle-roni!

08:02.483 --> 08:06.785
For the next exercise,
I'm gonna need your tongue!

08:06.787 --> 08:10.155
-Really?
-Tongue, please.

08:10.157 --> 08:14.359
This exercise
stretches the muscles
around the vocal cords.

08:14.361 --> 08:18.763
-Okay.
-Now, I want you to start
at a middle C,

08:18.765 --> 08:22.868
-and geeheehee your way
down the scale.
-Okay.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.769
-Geeheehee,
-Geeheehee,

08:24.771 --> 08:27.939

08:36.483 --> 08:41.720
Wunderbar!
Or as we say
in Nashville, yee-haw!

08:41.722 --> 08:44.556
-Your throat is warm.
Let's sing.
-Yay.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.891
Oh, sing? Really?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.792
It seems so soon!

08:47.794 --> 08:50.996
So soon? The world has waited
long enough to hear you sing.

08:50.998 --> 08:54.065
I think we should start
with "My Destiny."

08:54.067 --> 08:55.867
From your live show.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.704
I watched with Adele. Tears.
Both of us.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.707
Wait! Adele heard me sing?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.943
You know Adele Sugarbaker?

09:06.547 --> 09:08.914
Small world!

09:10.751 --> 09:12.851
One power ballad, coming up.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.153
-Okay.
-Make me feel it.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.823
(playing the piano)
Now I want you to imagine

09:18.825 --> 09:23.795
that you're
that Broadway stage,
opening night.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.768
That was your cue, hon.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.838
(playing piano)

09:33.840 --> 09:35.840
And there it was again.

09:35.842 --> 09:40.245
-Is everything all right, hon?
-No... I'm sorry,
no, we should stop.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.847
I can't do this.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.050
Well, you're not gonna know
unless you try.

09:45.052 --> 09:48.687
I know, but, if I try
and then I can't,
I'm gonna know,

09:48.689 --> 09:50.922
and I don't think
I'm ready to know.

09:50.924 --> 09:55.627
I'm... really scared,
and I'm really sorry,
I'm sorry.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.866
So what do we do now?

10:03.537 --> 10:08.406
I'm sure I don't know.
Why do you think
Liv didn't sing?

10:08.408 --> 10:10.942
Tell me... twin.

10:12.913 --> 10:17.048
Well, uh, I think Liv is afraid
that she's gonna be a nobody

10:17.050 --> 10:19.818
if she can't blow the roof
off a theater.

10:19.820 --> 10:24.723
I understand fear.
Every time I see a moth,
I black out and wake up

10:24.725 --> 10:26.391
in a pool of my own urine.

10:28.762 --> 10:33.932
We had to let Liv know
that she is a somebody
no matter how she sings.

10:33.934 --> 10:37.636
And Tracy couldn't really
help Liv but I knew who could.

10:37.638 --> 10:42.007
-Is it me?
-Ew! Ew, no, no, ew,
you go away!

10:47.280 --> 10:51.016
Okay! This is it!
If we win this event,
we're going to the bio-dome!

10:51.018 --> 10:53.251
Let's do this! Team Pal!

10:53.253 --> 10:56.921
-Yeah, I decided
I don't like it anymore--
-Okay, just make up your mind!

10:56.923 --> 11:02.994
Listen up, junior geniuses!
Imagine you're on Mars
and suddenly you lose contact

11:02.996 --> 11:06.965
-with Earth.
-Oh. Artie, pretend your crew
abandoned you.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.533
That should be easy.

11:08.535 --> 11:12.504
Nothing's easy for me.
I have issues.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.809
Are you two done?
I've got a whole thing here.

11:17.811 --> 11:22.313
In order to survive,
you must send a message to Earth
by building a transmitter

11:22.315 --> 11:23.848
using the spare parts
in your box.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.851
When it's received,
your light bulb will light up.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.888
What will you do?
What will... you do?

11:31.725 --> 11:34.759
First message received wins.
Let the madness begin!

11:36.063 --> 11:39.297
Okay... you work on the antenna,
and I'll build the transmitter.

11:40.801 --> 11:45.570
Team Ginger
has a rooting section?
Not fair!

11:45.572 --> 11:49.541
I should not be penalized
for being adored!

11:50.477 --> 11:52.410
Are you kidding me?

11:52.412 --> 11:54.045
Hey, Parker.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.015
Evan, I can't talk to you,
I have to focus on beating you.

11:57.017 --> 12:00.919
Okay. How about just
a pat on the back
for good luck?

12:02.089 --> 12:04.589
Uh... that was my neck.

12:04.591 --> 12:07.325
Guess I'm growing.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.696
Are you taking your minions
to Mars, too?

12:11.698 --> 12:12.931
There's not enough oxygen.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.867
They only breathe
when I tell them to!

12:15.869 --> 12:17.102
(snaps fingers)
(both inhaling)

12:18.772 --> 12:20.305
Problem solved.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.443
Why aren't you working
on the transmitter?

12:25.445 --> 12:28.113
I'm sorry, I'm just so itchy,
I don't know what's going on.

12:29.616 --> 12:33.952
You're covered in hives!
Is this what happens to you
in pressure situations?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.653
I can't go to space with this!

12:37.057 --> 12:40.925
Feelin' scratchy, Parker?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.428
Artie invented a cream
that causes itching.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.597
And I secretly applied it
to your neck.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.931
Boo-ya!

12:48.802 --> 12:50.935
Evan, I thought
that you were my friend.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.139
And he thought you were his!
But then you left!

12:54.141 --> 12:58.209
And I taught him
that it's better to be feared
that loved!

13:00.080 --> 13:05.116
Oh, right, breathe again.
(both exhaling)

13:12.092 --> 13:17.328
That was the ocean, Stacy.
But stay outta there,
because sharks live in there,

13:17.330 --> 13:21.132
and they think
you are delicious!
(kissing cat)

13:21.134 --> 13:24.602
Joey, honey...
do you remember
when you brought Stacy home,

13:24.604 --> 13:28.106
and I told you
not to get too attached
or go overboard with her?

13:28.108 --> 13:31.676
I remember you talking
while I was holdin' this kitty.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.079
Lemme show you something.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.117
Okay.

13:39.119 --> 13:42.153
Okay, well...
I know this seems like a lot,

13:42.155 --> 13:44.189
-but I play
with all this stuff, too.
-Okay.

13:45.759 --> 13:46.991
Joey...

13:46.993 --> 13:50.128
I saw a flier
for a missing kitten.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.096
It's Stacy.

13:54.601 --> 13:58.203
No-- no... that's not Stacy.

13:58.205 --> 14:01.172
Honey, I know you love her,
but she's not yours.

14:01.174 --> 14:05.143
And if you lost her,
you'd want whoever found her
to call you, too.

14:05.145 --> 14:09.781
Yeah... fine.
Call them.

14:09.783 --> 14:12.917
(exhales)
Grandma's being so unreasonable.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.221
Oh, come on, let's go
take a nap in the sink.

14:21.461 --> 14:25.029
Hey, Tracy...
why are we here?

14:25.031 --> 14:30.134
Because this... is where
you sang your heart out
for all of the world to see

14:30.136 --> 14:34.138
on live television,
and where you will sing again.

14:34.140 --> 14:38.843
Okay. Well...
changing where I am
doesn't make me any less scared.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.045
How about changin'
who you're with?

14:41.047 --> 14:43.081
Maddie,
raise that curtain, sugar.

14:43.083 --> 14:47.218
Yeah, no, I know, I'm...
I'm-- I'm sorry,
I'm not really sure

14:47.220 --> 14:49.320
which one it is.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.489
Yes! Found it!

14:57.898 --> 14:59.364
Two, three, four!

14:59.366 --> 15:01.399
-♪ The Dream! ♪
-♪ The Dream! ♪

15:04.838 --> 15:08.373
We tried to write a theme song,
but... that's as far
as we got.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.109
You guys... what are you
doing here?

15:11.111 --> 15:13.778
Maddie called.
She said our friend needed help.

15:13.780 --> 15:17.115
So now your band's here.
What are we singing first?

15:23.456 --> 15:27.292
I'm nearly done
with the antenna. Are you done
with the transmitter yet?

15:33.867 --> 15:36.801
Dude... Team Ginger's
almost finished!

15:36.803 --> 15:40.305
Hey... every time I put a piece
together, I have to stop
and scratch.

15:40.307 --> 15:44.742
Can you please help me?
Joey gave me the fleas once,
but this is way worse!

15:44.744 --> 15:49.280
I can't build an antenna
and a transmitter
at the same time!

15:49.282 --> 15:52.317
Well, I can't scratch
and build a transmitter
at the same time.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.119
Who am I kidding? I give up.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.755
Parker's giving up!
Victory is ours!

15:57.757 --> 16:00.491
Artie told me
that when I defeated my enemies,

16:00.493 --> 16:04.896
I'd feel a sense
of satisfaction.
All I feel is the crummies.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.800
I don't think I wanna do this.

16:08.802 --> 16:13.871
Minions don't think.
Minions only do. Now get back
to minioning!

16:14.808 --> 16:16.841
Defeat your enemy!

16:16.843 --> 16:20.278
He's not my enemy.
He's my friend.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.514
And I'm no minion!
My name is Evan!

16:29.923 --> 16:32.790
Get back to work, Dr. P.
You build, I'll scratch.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.794
-What are you doing?
-Righting a wrong. I'm sorry
I betrayed you.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.396
Now connect that motherboard!

16:44.971 --> 16:51.075
(tense action music)

16:56.483 --> 16:58.016
Hit it, Val.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.287
Parker and Val
win Mars Madness!

17:03.289 --> 17:05.390
We're going to the bio-dome!

17:05.392 --> 17:08.926
-Go Team Pal!
-Okay, now you're just
messing with me.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.664
Hey... thanks
for helping us, Evan.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.801
No problem. It's the least
I can do for my friend.

17:18.004 --> 17:21.205
This is a travesty!
Minions!

17:22.675 --> 17:26.644
To the pier!
I need funnel cake
to heal my wounds.

17:28.415 --> 17:32.450
Former minions are not invited!

17:37.857 --> 17:41.059
Oh, it's so great
to see you guys!

17:41.061 --> 17:46.097
But I'm sorry.
I can't... rock out right now.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.833
Oh, you'd rather...
do a quiet song, that's cool.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.168
No, um...

17:50.170 --> 17:53.237
Cutie pie, help us
with the piano.

17:56.443 --> 17:59.010
Why does he assume
he's "cutie pie"?

17:59.012 --> 18:02.313
You're cute, too.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.451
Mind if I talk to Liv,
who I flew 2,000 miles to help?

18:06.453 --> 18:08.519
Fine. But we're coming back
to this.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.023
-Liv?
-Yeah?

18:12.025 --> 18:14.792
What's goin' on?
Why won't you sing?

18:16.262 --> 18:19.864
Well... I really want to try.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.035
I don't know, you guys,
I mean...

18:24.037 --> 18:28.473
singing is such a huge part
of who I am, and if I can't sing
the same, who am I?

18:30.443 --> 18:33.377
You're a girl
whose love for singing
brought this band together.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.049
I love playing music with you.

18:39.085 --> 18:42.153
Not
just because you sounded great.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.655
Because we were having fun.

18:46.392 --> 18:50.094
Don't give up
on something you love
just because you're afraid.

18:50.096 --> 18:54.365
Yeah, Liv, I never even tried
to play music before I heard
"What a Girl Is."

18:55.301 --> 18:57.268
Your voice inspired me.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.204
And it's not because
of how you sounded,
but what you had to say.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.674
And I think
you have more to say.

19:05.445 --> 19:12.350
(grunting)
All right. This was super heavy,
and these two... were no help.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.753
We're musicians, not movers.
Thank you.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.256
So... where do we stand?

19:18.258 --> 19:21.526
Liv doesn't know who she is
if she can't sing well.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.660
Do you wanna know who you are?

19:26.032 --> 19:28.266
You're Liv Rooney.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.134
And you're awesome.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.702
Okay?

19:31.704 --> 19:37.341
I know you're scared,
but sometimes you just...
have to take a leap of faith.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.443
Give it a shot.

19:39.445 --> 19:44.849
Yeah, Liv... aren't you the girl
who told me that fear
is just another reason

19:44.851 --> 19:46.350
to try harder?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.787
All of your friends
are here for you.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.355
Why don't you just try?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.460
Okay, I'll try.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.630
Yes! I'm such a good coach!

20:00.867 --> 20:03.568
Oh... I know the perfect song.

20:08.641 --> 20:13.611

Liv! Come on,
that was amazing!

20:48.881 --> 20:52.583
(squealing)
I can sing!
I can sing!

20:52.585 --> 20:56.187
Oh, thank you so much,
I really love you guys.

20:56.189 --> 20:57.688
I'm so proud of you.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.724
Thank you.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.460
Now, Liv, if you do end up
on Broadway, you better
invite me to opening night.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.896
-Broadway?
-Yeah...
there are some producers

21:05.898 --> 21:08.599
who um... called me
to talk to me about a musical.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.235
Whoa. Amazing!

21:11.237 --> 21:14.038
That's so cool.
Liv, this is your dream.

21:14.040 --> 21:19.176
I know. I know,
and now that my voice is back,
that could actually happen!

21:21.080 --> 21:25.449
Oh, um... I hate to do this.
I have to go to the airport.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.817
Okay.

21:28.087 --> 21:32.156
I don't know if you know,
but I go to NYU now.

21:33.559 --> 21:36.227
So if you wind up in New York,
give me a call.

21:36.229 --> 21:37.695
Okay.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.016
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

21:59.018 --> 22:01.085
Stop it! Stop it!

22:03.523 --> 22:04.855
(camera shutter clicks)

22:04.857 --> 22:07.325
Okie-dokie.

22:07.327 --> 22:11.362
Before your real family comes,
I'm gonna make a lifetime
of memories with ya.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.465
All right, now let's
get a picture of you

22:14.467 --> 22:16.167
opening your Easter basket, eh?

22:17.937 --> 22:20.171
Joey, I just spoke
with Stacy's owner.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.473
What'd they say about me
visiting her, Mom, can I,
can I, please?

22:22.475 --> 22:26.077
Well... um...
it's complicated.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.547
Where is my precious kitty?

22:29.549 --> 22:33.117
Christian,
use your delicate hands
to comfort her.

22:33.119 --> 22:38.356
What? Artie,
no way, she's your cat?

22:39.826 --> 22:43.527
Taylor left her carrier
unattended at the airport.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.964
I guess "never let her
out of your sight"
means nothing!

22:49.068 --> 22:52.837
I've been worried sick.

22:52.839 --> 22:57.708
Joey... thank you
for taking care of her.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.243
I owe you one.

22:59.245 --> 23:00.411
It was my pleasure.

23:01.547 --> 23:06.751
Goodbye. Oh, I'm really
gonna miss you, Stacy.

23:06.753 --> 23:10.755
Stacy!
(laughs) Ridiculous!

23:10.757 --> 23:14.759
There's only one name
for something as beautiful

23:14.761 --> 23:16.594
as you.

23:16.596 --> 23:19.563
Her name is Liv Rooney.

23:20.733 --> 23:24.702
Minions, to Wisconsin!
(snaps fingers)

23:24.704 --> 23:27.605
Oh...
there's one more thing, Joseph.

23:27.607 --> 23:30.307
Tell the world Artie Smalls--

23:31.778 --> 23:32.777
Artie:<i> I've got issues.</i>
