00:01.668 --> 00:04.295
{\an5}MOLLY:
<i>I went to space</i>
<i>on a 13-month solo mission.</i>

00:04.379 --> 00:06.256
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:06.339 --> 00:09.467
<i>The child-- part human,</i>
<i>part alien--</i>

00:09.551 --> 00:11.594
<i>was unlike anything</i>
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

00:11.678 --> 00:14.180
<i>My other child is</i>
<i>a lifelike android.</i>

00:14.264 --> 00:15.890
Mom?

00:15.974 --> 00:17.434
<i>He has become the prototype</i>
<i>for a new breed</i>

00:17.517 --> 00:20.895
<i>of thinking machines</i>
<i>called Humanichs.</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:24.315
<i>These two extraordinary</i>
<i>new life-forms</i>

00:24.399 --> 00:26.276
<i>now hold the key</i>
<i>to Earth's future.</i>

00:26.359 --> 00:28.278
<i>But where does that leave us?</i>

00:28.361 --> 00:29.904
<i>Over 99% of all species</i>

00:29.988 --> 00:33.283
<i>that have ever existed</i>
<i>have gone extinct.</i>

00:33.366 --> 00:36.578
<i>What if it's our time?</i>

00:38.371 --> 00:40.331
<i>Previously on</i> Extant...

00:40.415 --> 00:42.292
(gasps)

00:42.375 --> 00:43.293
I thought we'd lost you.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.253
(gasps softly)

00:45.336 --> 00:47.130
MOLLY:
<i>I shed my old life today.</i>

00:47.213 --> 00:48.298
(whirring)

00:48.381 --> 00:50.133
{\an3}JOHN'S VOICE:
Molly, this is John.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.469
{\an3}A Humanich has
killed a human being.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.599
{\an3}There's only one thing
that can stop them.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.395
<i>The person who has been</i>
<i>entrusted with guarding this</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:03.813
is Nicholas Calderon.

01:05.272 --> 01:07.150
{\an3}Molly, when you died,
what did you see?

01:07.233 --> 01:08.985
MOLLY:
<i>You were dying.</i>

01:09.068 --> 01:10.653
<i>And I think</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:12.322
I killed you.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.158
Toby, you're under arrest.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.368
On what charge?
Aiding a known enemy.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.828
We've been playing
Calderon's game.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.663
{\an1}He ginned up
the hybrid threat

01:20.747 --> 01:23.333
<i>to launch a worldwide</i>

01:23.416 --> 01:25.460
Humanichs revolution.
You need a good lawyer, Toby.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.463
SHEPHERD:
<i>I am gonna find Calderon,</i>

01:28.546 --> 01:30.423
<i>and I am gonna take him down.</i>

01:30.507 --> 01:32.509
Call Molly Woods.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.551
Toby?

01:34.636 --> 01:35.970
Molly.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.533
This is the Global Security
Commission, and our job,

01:56.616 --> 01:59.285
{\an4}what we are paid to do,
is to protect the people
of this planet.

01:59.369 --> 02:03.248
And we can't even protect
our own people,

02:03.331 --> 02:06.084
our own damn building.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.211
And I have to tell you,
I'm pissed off right now.

02:09.294 --> 02:12.048
{\an1}And if you're not pissed off,
too, you do not belong

02:12.131 --> 02:14.884
in this room.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.221
If you don't want revenge
for what was done to us,

02:18.304 --> 02:20.849
you should walk out that door
and never come back.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.184
Because I need warriors.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.978
Does everyone understand?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.690
Stop nodding your damn head
and answer me.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.775
Do you understand?!

02:30.859 --> 02:33.069
ALL:
Yes, ma'am.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.824
Flip to page two
of the updated assessment.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.577
(urgent chatter)

02:40.660 --> 02:41.953
WOMAN:
It's still too early

02:42.036 --> 02:43.955
to determine the cause
of the blast.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.916
Global Security Commission Chief
General Tobias Shepherd

02:47.000 --> 02:48.251
is believed
to have been the driver.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.087
Now sources say
General Shepherd fled the GSC

02:51.170 --> 02:52.755
after assisting
the terrorist cell

02:52.839 --> 02:55.592
that attacked its regional
headquarters, going as...

02:55.675 --> 02:58.970
(TV clicks off,
remote thuds on table)

02:59.053 --> 03:01.055
{\an3}Guy finally does
something honorable,

03:01.139 --> 03:03.391
{\an3}and of course
they get it wrong.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.478
It was my fault.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.481
He died trying to help me.

03:10.565 --> 03:14.277
{\an3}Molly, don't do
that to yourself.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.281
{\an3}All right? Shepherd died
doing the right thing.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.909
(sniffles)

03:20.992 --> 03:23.244
It's never gonna be over now.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.788
He was our only hope.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.291
No, not according to John.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.793
We'll find this Calderon guy,

03:30.877 --> 03:33.296
{\an1}and we'll shut down
Humanichs ourself with...

03:33.379 --> 03:35.882
whatever this is.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.305
{\an1}RICHTER:
Molly.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.349
What did you do to me?

03:53.232 --> 03:56.235
I'll send the rest of your stuff
as soon as you're ready, okay?

03:58.571 --> 04:00.865
Don't be sad, Julie.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.034
We'll see each other again.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.872
{\an3}JULIE:
Of course we will.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.630
I love you, Rabbit.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.173
I love you, too, Julie.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.091
(sobs softly)

04:29.435 --> 04:30.853
I think it's time.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.647
For what?

04:32.730 --> 04:35.483
To put the past behind us.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.988
{\an3}You're always gonna be
a part of his life.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.031
And mine, too.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.333
FIONA: We've installed
delta wave sensors

04:52.417 --> 04:56.170
in all 52 states,
per your recommendation.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.755
TAALR:
Very good, Madame Secretary.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.092
Eradication of
the hybrid species is essential

05:01.175 --> 05:03.928
to the preservation
of the human race.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.888
About General Shepherd's death.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.932
What about it?

05:08.016 --> 05:10.393
Have you reviewed
the preliminary reports?

05:10.476 --> 05:13.396
Yes. The explosion appears
to have been generated

05:13.479 --> 05:16.190
from an outside source.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.568
Perhaps the hybrids
launched another assault.

05:18.651 --> 05:22.530
But why would the hybrids kill
Toby if he was helping them?

05:22.613 --> 05:25.658
If there's another player
on the board, I need to know.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.411
Of course, but this brings up
the question

05:28.494 --> 05:31.247
of your own safety,
Madame Secretary.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.083
I have adequate security.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.085
As did General Shepherd.

05:36.169 --> 05:40.173
I have a few suggestions,
ones you may find unorthodox.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.262
Terra?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.264
She's gone.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.475
I knew we shouldn't
have left her here.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.104
What is all this?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.440
It's one of the things
that survived the fire.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.109
It's from John's

06:00.193 --> 06:01.903
and Calderon's old office.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.655
Our best hope for finding him
is in this box.

06:04.739 --> 06:08.076
ETHAN:
Chessboard. Cool.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.411
John and Calderon
worked together?

06:10.495 --> 06:12.413
Yeah.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.624
For about seven years.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.918
{\an1}And then they had
a huge falling out,

06:17.001 --> 06:20.171
and apparently
Calderon went off the deep end.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.632
{\an1}RICHTER:
So he's crazy enough

06:22.715 --> 06:25.635
to launch the biggest
cyber attack in history

06:25.718 --> 06:27.970
and genius enough
not to get caught.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.139
Lethal combination, right?

06:30.223 --> 06:33.309
MALE VOICE: Resuming session
with previous opponent.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.191
Is that him?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.320
It's John.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.327
Mom?

06:53.037 --> 06:54.288
Somebody's on the other side

06:54.372 --> 06:56.457
of the board.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.335
Slow down. What are
you talking about?

06:59.418 --> 07:01.420
John Woods embedded
a message in Ethan

07:01.504 --> 07:03.506
{\an1}telling us to find
his old partner, Calderon.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.675
Nicholas Calderon?
Yes.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.176
The message is meant
to be triggered

07:07.260 --> 07:09.804
if a Humanich breaks protocol
and kills a human being.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.014
It happened.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.141
They're not just
killing hybrids.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.308
They're killing humans, too.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.853
{\an1}LUCY:
One human.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.313
FIONA: Nate Malone was
a hybrid sympathizer.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.107
Thankfully, Lucy took action.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.277
{\an3}Your hard work on ethical
adaptor algorithms paid off.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.699
Can I speak to you alone
for a second?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.159
I've made Lucy
my head of security.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.869
{\an3}Whatever you have
to say to me,

07:32.952 --> 07:34.370
you can say in
front of her.

07:34.453 --> 07:36.205
I know you two have had
some misunderstandings.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.167
We're gonna leave all that
behind us for the greater good.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.376
Are we clear?

07:40.459 --> 07:41.586
Yes, ma'am.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.547
{\an3}Of course.
Good.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.175
Since you're here,

07:47.258 --> 07:49.844
{\an3}I'm making some changes
in the Humanichs Lab.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.554
What kind of changes?

07:51.637 --> 07:53.848
{\an3}Our allies are placing
orders in the thousands.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.726
{\an6}We can't meet
that kind of demand.
Not with human workers, no.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.437
You're gonna put Humanichs
at work in the lab?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.856
{\an3}FIONA: They don't get tired,
they don't call in sick.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.566
And best of all,
they don't question orders.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.401
{\an6}But...
And if you want
to keep your job,

08:05.484 --> 08:07.403
neither should you.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.572
ETHAN:
<i>Do you think it's him?</i>

08:09.655 --> 08:13.075
{\an1}Well, whoever it is
wants us to know he's there.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.953
{\an1}Otherwise, why would
he keep playing?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.206
He's sending us a message.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.373
John used to send me messages

08:19.457 --> 08:21.209
all around the house
in binary code.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.878
{\an3}He used to use
zeroes and ones.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.213
Now, I couldn't understand it,

08:25.296 --> 08:27.798
but I had a program
that can decode it.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.258
Well, black squares
could be ones

08:29.342 --> 08:31.093
and white squares
could be zeroes. Simple.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.095
Yeah, simple.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.181
Watch.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.152
{\an1}RICHTER:
What are you saying?

08:48.236 --> 08:49.195
Hi.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.613
I thought

08:50.696 --> 08:52.448
you didn't understand
this stuff.

08:52.531 --> 08:55.868
I didn't. Before.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.292
RICHTER:
What's he saying?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.460
ETHAN:
They're numbers.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.671
"Three, seven."

09:06.754 --> 09:08.589
Spelling out the word "dot."

09:08.673 --> 09:10.299
Could be coordinates.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.467
He's telling us how to find him.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.303
I got it.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.472
{\an3}It's only 15 miles
from here.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.975
Let's go, Ethan. You and I are
gonna take a little road trip.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.936
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "you and I"?

09:22.019 --> 09:24.146
This is one place you can't go.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.190
{\an3}The hell I can't.
If you go to Calderon's,

09:26.274 --> 09:29.986
I'm scared you're gonna die.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.043
We are talking about the world's
most dangerous man here.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.504
{\an1}You think I'm gonna let
you and Ethan

09:48.587 --> 09:50.172
just venture off by yourselves?

09:50.256 --> 09:54.135
Okay, look at this.

09:54.218 --> 09:57.179
{\an3}This is the amulet that
I was holding in my dream

09:57.263 --> 09:58.723
when I tried to kill you.

09:58.806 --> 10:02.393
So what? Maybe you recognize it
from somewhere else.

10:02.476 --> 10:03.894
Maybe John had a picture of it.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.855
{\an3}Maybe this is the
future, and I saw it.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.857
Listen, I am sorry
you had this dream,

10:07.940 --> 10:10.192
I really am, but let me
tell you something about dreams.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.028
I have them every night,
and you know what?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.237
None of them come true.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.281
{\an1}So, if you're going,
I'm going,

10:15.364 --> 10:17.074
and if you want to do

10:17.158 --> 10:20.661
your weird, glowy-eye thing
to stop me...

10:20.745 --> 10:23.247
knock yourself out.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.961
I have lost too many
people that I loved,

10:29.045 --> 10:32.006
{\an3}and I am not gonna
lose you, too.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.722
You're not gonna.

10:39.805 --> 10:43.059
This is my choice.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.020
{\an1}It's mine.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.484
(elevator bell dings)

11:06.624 --> 11:08.918
{\an1}(quietly):
Hello, and welcome to Oceania.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.586
I just found out.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.088
I mean, they're talking about
accelerated production here.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.298
You know how many of
these things they could unleash

11:14.382 --> 11:16.801
if we don't find a way to...

11:22.390 --> 11:24.308
{\an3}(quietly):
I saw Molly Woods.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.435
She's alive?
Where is she?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.145
{\an3}Trying to track down
Nicholas Calderon.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.981
The fugitive?

11:31.065 --> 11:34.652
{\an1}He may have hijacked Lucy and
the entire Humanichs operation.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.572
{\an1}This is
really freakin' ungood.

No help to us-- we both
know that. Just you and me.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.913
What do we do?

11:47.873 --> 11:50.126
{\an1}Lucy told Shepherd
that she was answering

11:50.209 --> 11:52.628
to a higher authority.

11:52.711 --> 11:56.674
We need to find out where
those orders are coming from

11:56.757 --> 11:59.009
and cut off communication.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.930
You need to get close to her,
Charlie.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.766
How close?

12:07.726 --> 12:11.689
Close enough
to swap out her network card.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.567
(sighs)

12:22.116 --> 12:24.952
(arguing inaudibly)

13:05.451 --> 13:06.994
Trouble?

13:07.077 --> 13:08.913
{\an3}CHARLIE:
No.

13:08.996 --> 13:12.416
{\an1}Yeah. I... I don't want
to talk about it.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.003
{\an3}She doesn't
appreciate you.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.004
You were listening?

13:17.087 --> 13:19.381
That's not really your business.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.176
{\an3}Actually, everything that
happens here is my business.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.844
I've been promoted.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.846

N-No, what?

13:29.808 --> 13:30.893

13:30.976 --> 13:32.394
we should celebrate

I could volunteer as lab

Threat Assessment and

21:23.782 --> 21:27.828
John would say,
"Imagine the greatest minds

21:27.911 --> 21:31.206
"in the world coming together
to solve its biggest problem:

21:31.289 --> 21:34.001
the threat of human extinction."

21:34.084 --> 21:35.711
Then I'd jump in.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.713
"Asteroids, pandemics,

21:37.796 --> 21:40.632
environmental catastrophes."

21:42.718 --> 21:45.554
Oh, we were good.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.724
You'd posit
an extinction level scenario.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.686
Taylor would recommend
a course of action

21:52.769 --> 21:55.439
to preserve the greatest
percentage of human life.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.859
The bigger the problem,
the better he got.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.069
Millions of decision trees

22:01.153 --> 22:03.739
all branching out...

22:03.822 --> 22:06.408
exponentially.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.744
He was sublime.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.579
Was?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.792
It wasn't long before
the government came calling.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.464
Instead of tsunamis,
they posed different questions.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.924
{\an1}Next thing we knew,
he was telling us

22:23.008 --> 22:24.301
what wars to start,

22:24.384 --> 22:26.428
what countries to invade.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.805
He wasn't making
recommendations.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.766
He was taking actions.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.184
I tried to shut him down,

22:32.267 --> 22:34.269
{\an1}but...

22:34.352 --> 22:36.104
{\an3}he didn't care for that.
Are you saying

22:36.188 --> 22:39.441
you were framed for
those bombings by a computer?

22:40.817 --> 22:42.319
My husband was on his way

22:42.402 --> 22:44.279
to your house the night he died.

22:44.362 --> 22:46.865
{\an1}John knew I had a way
to shut them down.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.826
A kill switch.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.788
{\an1}Taylor decided
to stop him.

22:52.871 --> 22:56.583
So Taylor killed my husband?

23:01.171 --> 23:03.965
{\an1}Taylor knew that
if John shut down Humanichs,

23:04.049 --> 23:06.468
the human race was in danger,

23:06.551 --> 23:08.804
{\an3}because Humanichs were
the best defense

23:08.887 --> 23:10.347
against the invasion.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.807
{\an3}RICHTER:
If Taylor discovered

23:11.890 --> 23:16.978
that humans were threatened
with extinction...

23:17.062 --> 23:18.605
what would he do?

23:18.688 --> 23:21.525
If he had to kill
a billion people

23:21.608 --> 23:24.778
to save eight billion,

23:24.861 --> 23:26.655
that's just what he would do.

23:26.738 --> 23:30.158
{\an3}So, the kill switch
is the amulet.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.451
{\an1}It is.

23:31.535 --> 23:34.955
Unfortunately, it disappeared

23:35.038 --> 23:37.165
{\an1}when the government
confiscated my property.

23:37.249 --> 23:41.670
{\an1}I'm sorry I don't have
better news for you.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.964
Now... (sighs)

23:46.758 --> 23:48.760
Do you mind?

23:55.934 --> 23:57.894
(elevator bell dings)

23:57.978 --> 23:59.980
(gentle French music playing)

24:07.154 --> 24:08.738
What's all this?

24:10.949 --> 24:13.034
Well, I know you have memories
of Paris

24:13.118 --> 24:14.828
implanted in your brain,

24:14.911 --> 24:16.913
but I wanted you

24:16.997 --> 24:19.833
As much as you can, anyway.

24:22.502 --> 24:26.965
{\an3}So I got, uh, croissants,
I got Gruyère cheese,

24:27.048 --> 24:31.303
chocolate, champagne,
non-alcoholic.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.597
You did this for me?

24:34.806 --> 24:37.017
Why?

24:38.977 --> 24:40.395
To apologize.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.397
For what?

24:46.484 --> 24:48.695
For treating you like a machine.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.866
Because you are so much more

24:52.949 --> 24:55.452
Thank you.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.414
Want to know a secret?

24:59.497 --> 25:01.249
I love secrets.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.418
I've been working
on a little side project.

25:03.501 --> 25:06.129
{\an3}Something the GSC
would never let me do,

25:06.213 --> 25:07.756
because it's not
a military upgrade.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.299
What is it?

25:09.382 --> 25:11.927
A neural sensitivity enhancer

25:12.010 --> 25:14.429
designed to give you

25:14.512 --> 25:17.224
even more
of the human sensory experience,

25:17.307 --> 25:19.309
to heighten your
sense of touch.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.144
When will it be done?

25:21.228 --> 25:23.230
Well...

25:25.190 --> 25:26.900
I just need a beta tester.

25:26.983 --> 25:28.985
{\an3}Know anyone who
might be interested?

25:35.283 --> 25:37.410
There we go.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.705
{\an3}Now you should
feel a slight...

25:48.546 --> 25:50.298
Did that feel
any different?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.634
{\an1}No.

25:52.717 --> 25:54.761
But I still liked it.

25:54.844 --> 25:57.180
I'll keep working.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.307
And we'll keep testing.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.563

"Moonlight Sonata")

26:12.862 --> 26:15.657
CALDERON: John and I never

26:15.740 --> 26:17.117
{\an3}This is the future

Wait a second.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.707
Are you saying
that Frankie is a Humanich?

26:23.790 --> 26:25.333
A Syntiate. My design.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.294
There's a difference.

26:27.377 --> 26:28.878
Any why doesn't she speak?

26:28.962 --> 26:31.840
{\an3}Some of her parts have
worn down, but she gets by.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.551
{\an1}Okay, well, look,
it's been a long day, so...

26:34.634 --> 26:36.678
Listen, you can stay
as long as you like.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.680
{\an3}We grow plenty of food,
music in the evening,

26:38.763 --> 26:40.307
a beautiful pond
to skinny dip in.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.309
{\an3}And at least you'll
be safe here.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.562
Okay, you have to have
another plan up your sleeve,

26:45.645 --> 26:47.856
some way we can stop Taylor.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.317
{\an3}In chess, it's considered
poor etiquette

26:50.400 --> 26:52.152
