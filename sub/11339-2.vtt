WEBVTT

00:02.122 --> 00:03.989
was vacationing at the beach
with friends

00:04.395 --> 00:06.663
when she disappeared
nearly 3 days ago.

00:06.730 --> 00:08.782
Atlantic beach Detective
Bob mathias...

00:08.866 --> 00:12.152
They've had suspects
in custody the whole
time, but nothing.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.655
Can't even charge them
with anything unless
they find her body.

00:15.723 --> 00:18.508
What are
the chances of that?

00:18.576 --> 00:20.560
...But are cooperating
with the investigation.

00:20.628 --> 00:21.678
Mathias says
without a body...

00:21.745 --> 00:24.147
They're still in Hotch's
office, huh?

00:24.215 --> 00:25.799
It can't be good.

00:25.883 --> 00:27.584
...Are suspected
in her disappearance.

00:27.635 --> 00:29.419
Authorities
only have 12 hours left

00:29.470 --> 00:31.421
to hold the men in custody
without an official charge.

00:35.465 --> 00:36.632
JJ's still in there?

00:36.684 --> 00:38.634
And Strauss.

00:38.686 --> 00:40.854
Oh, again with the dairy?

00:40.938 --> 00:41.905
I can't help it.
I love dairy.

00:41.972 --> 00:43.706
It's been, like,
what, 20 minutes?

00:43.774 --> 00:45.692
Well, 10 more minutes,
we're in the air.

00:45.776 --> 00:47.360
I don't think
it's about the case.

00:47.444 --> 00:48.978
Do you know something?

00:49.029 --> 00:50.747
Do I know something?

00:50.814 --> 00:52.815
She just repeated
the question.

00:52.867 --> 00:53.867
You always say
that's a sign.

00:53.951 --> 00:55.535
Do you know why JJ's in there?

00:55.603 --> 00:57.287
I have no idea.

00:57.338 --> 00:58.705
What is going on?

00:58.789 --> 01:00.139
Maybe she asked
for a raise.

01:00.207 --> 01:03.710
Have his blinds
ever been closed?

01:06.063 --> 01:08.481
I have given it thought.
I'm not interested.

01:08.549 --> 01:10.833
Clearly. You turned
down the job twice

01:10.885 --> 01:12.886
without consulting
your unit chief.

01:12.953 --> 01:15.772
Agent Jareau
is under no obligation
to discuss it with me.

01:15.839 --> 01:18.674
If the Pentagon calls
one of your team members,

01:18.726 --> 01:20.059
you should know about it.

01:20.144 --> 01:21.677
Why didn't you tell
Agent Hotchner

01:21.729 --> 01:23.446
that you turned down
the position?

01:23.513 --> 01:25.014
I never wanted it
to get this far because--

01:25.065 --> 01:27.516
because you know
it's a better job.

01:27.568 --> 01:28.902
Because I don't want
to leave this one.

01:28.986 --> 01:30.453
You've been here
for 6 years.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.854
Nearly 7, ma'am.

01:31.906 --> 01:33.522
Change is good.

01:33.574 --> 01:35.992
And from what I understand,
there's less travel

01:36.043 --> 01:38.361
with this position.
You could stay home
with Henry.

01:38.412 --> 01:39.462
Excuse me?

01:39.529 --> 01:42.131
I understand
the sacrifices.

01:42.199 --> 01:43.800
I do what I love.

01:43.867 --> 01:45.251
It's made me
a better person,

01:45.336 --> 01:46.920
a better mother.

01:47.004 --> 01:49.038
Any "sacrifices"
I have made

01:49.089 --> 01:50.623
have been for my family.

01:50.691 --> 01:52.825
I don't have a single regret.

01:52.893 --> 01:55.044
We're all in agreement
that Agent Jareau's

01:55.112 --> 01:56.512
a valuable part
of this team,

01:56.580 --> 01:58.681
and it's understandable
why the executive branch

01:58.732 --> 02:00.383
is requesting a transfer.

02:00.434 --> 02:03.820
However, if Agent Jareau
respectfully declines
their request,

02:03.887 --> 02:05.721
there's no way
you can make her go.

02:11.728 --> 02:13.363
No, I can't.

02:14.615 --> 02:17.333
Have you looked at the video
of the missing girl?

02:17.401 --> 02:18.668
Everyone's
watching it now.

02:18.735 --> 02:21.504
You're expected in Maryland
within the hour.

02:21.571 --> 02:23.456
We'll be there.

02:23.507 --> 02:25.875
Thank you.

02:28.262 --> 02:30.046
JJ.

02:30.097 --> 02:31.064
Pentagon?

02:31.131 --> 02:32.748
Sorry I didn't tell you.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.184
It's ok. It's just--
it's a big deal.

02:35.252 --> 02:36.970
A liaison for
the department of defense--

02:37.054 --> 02:38.354
it's a major promotion.

02:38.422 --> 02:40.356
Are you sure
you don't want this?

02:40.424 --> 02:43.276
Hotch, I belong here.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.273 --> 03:00.660
You'd think profilers
would cover better
than that, wouldn't you?

03:00.744 --> 03:02.128
You read up on the suspects?

03:03.714 --> 03:06.299
Presents like the typical
dominant/submissive,

03:06.383 --> 03:07.834
but I doubt
it's that textbook.

03:07.918 --> 03:10.553
Well, we only got
one shot at this.

03:14.641 --> 03:16.175
How long have they been
in custody?

03:16.260 --> 03:19.929
60 hours. We have 12 hours
to get a confession
or find the body.

03:19.980 --> 03:21.264
Syd Pearson has a lot
of money and connections.

03:21.315 --> 03:23.182
If we let him go,
we may never see him again.

03:23.267 --> 03:24.183
And Barrett?

03:24.268 --> 03:25.985
He doesn't have
the same resources.

03:26.070 --> 03:27.737
Do you think
these guys did it?

03:27.804 --> 03:28.988
The locals do.

03:29.073 --> 03:30.639
They tried to get them
to turn against one another,

03:30.691 --> 03:31.941
but that didn't work.

03:31.992 --> 03:33.993
It seems they have a Bond
that dates back to childhood.

03:34.078 --> 03:35.811
We only have
a 30-minute flight.

03:35.863 --> 03:37.497
That's not enough time
to delve into
their histories.

03:37.581 --> 03:38.781
Bullet points on
the missing woman.

03:38.832 --> 03:40.649
Second and third
pages are all about
the suspects.

03:40.701 --> 03:42.835
Garcia, we're gonna need
phone records,
credit card receipts,

03:42.920 --> 03:44.003
anything you can find.

03:44.088 --> 03:46.672
Yes, you'll have them
when you get back.

03:46.757 --> 03:48.007
Thank you.

03:48.092 --> 03:49.759
Is everything ok?

03:49.826 --> 03:52.512
What, you mean Strauss?

03:52.596 --> 03:54.847
Don't. I know that look.

03:54.932 --> 03:56.799
Everything's
going to be fine.

03:56.809 --> 04:01.709

04:34.099 --> 04:35.984
Jean Racine said,

04:36.068 --> 04:38.987
"a tragedy need not have
blood and death.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.655
"It's enough that
it all be filled

04:40.740 --> 04:42.323
"with that majestic sadness

04:42.408 --> 04:44.909
that is the pleasure
of tragedy."

04:56.955 --> 04:58.256
Hey, you ok?

04:58.307 --> 05:00.175
Uh, yeah. You?

05:00.259 --> 05:02.627
I just feel kind of sick.
Excuse me.

05:09.968 --> 05:11.686
Hey.

05:11.771 --> 05:12.987
Hey.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.576
I got this offer
from the Pentagon.

05:18.644 --> 05:20.361
I turned it down twice.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.614
I never told Hotch
or Strauss.

05:22.665 --> 05:25.583
And now Strauss
wants you to take it.

05:25.651 --> 05:27.252
Well, of course she does.

05:27.319 --> 05:28.753
It'll make her look good
if you get promoted.

05:28.821 --> 05:31.172
I don't trust her
for a second.

05:31.257 --> 05:33.374
You shouldn't.
What does Hotch think?

05:33.459 --> 05:34.542
He knows
I don't want to go.

05:34.627 --> 05:35.844
Well, then you won't.

05:35.928 --> 05:38.546
Penelope's pretty
freaked out, huh?

05:38.631 --> 05:40.265
You have to ask?

05:42.184 --> 05:43.718
Ok, let's review.

05:43.803 --> 05:46.354
Ok. Kate Joyce,
19 years old,

05:46.439 --> 05:49.173
was last seen leaving a bar
with these two men,

05:49.225 --> 05:51.693
Sydney Pearson
and James Barrett,

05:51.777 --> 05:53.978
both 20 years old.
She was reported missing

05:54.029 --> 05:56.030
the next morning when
she didn't meet her friends.

05:56.115 --> 05:57.816
That was almost 3 days ago.

05:57.867 --> 05:59.567
Their story is they
dropped Kate at the motel,

05:59.652 --> 06:01.703
but there were no cameras
to confirm that.

06:01.787 --> 06:04.239
And search and rescue's
been all over the island.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.741
Dragged the inlet
and they found
absolutely nothing.

06:06.826 --> 06:07.959
Both said they had sex
with Kate.

06:08.026 --> 06:09.193
They're claiming
it was consensual.

06:09.245 --> 06:11.846
There's no way to confirm.
There's no body.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.197
I doubt
it was consensual.

06:13.249 --> 06:14.649
We've got to prove
they're guilty

06:14.717 --> 06:16.835
of more than just
being seen with her.

06:16.886 --> 06:18.002
Well,
the police weren't

06:18.053 --> 06:19.704
able to find any holes
in their stories.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.422
We're gonna have to break
them down psychologically.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.808
Morgan, I want you and prentiss
to lead the interrogation.

06:23.876 --> 06:25.143
Dave, you and reid
start at the bar.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.929
JJ, Kate Joyce's family
is still at the station.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.098
Still? For 3 days?

06:30.182 --> 06:32.100
They never went
to the hotel.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.184
I want you to stay with them.

06:33.235 --> 06:34.519
Yeah.

06:35.771 --> 06:36.721
They haven't left.

06:36.772 --> 06:37.989
The mayor personally
set them up

06:38.056 --> 06:39.491
with a penthouse suite
at the Harrison grand,

06:39.558 --> 06:40.892
but they won't go.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.060
They can't. You're their
only source of information.

06:43.112 --> 06:45.163
To be even a minute away
would add to their torture.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.831
I've kept them away
from the suspects.

06:46.899 --> 06:49.367
Now, I don't get
why you want them together.

06:49.418 --> 06:50.735
Trust me.

06:51.904 --> 06:53.288
You're from the FBI?

06:53.372 --> 06:54.956
Yes, ma'am.
Jennifer Jareau.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.124
JJ?

06:56.208 --> 06:58.092
Kate was almost
Jennifer.

06:58.177 --> 07:00.295
Jennifer Joyce.
We would have called her JJ.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.181
Would you two like
to head to the hotel?

07:03.248 --> 07:06.050
I'll come with you.
We'll have constant
contact with my team.

07:06.118 --> 07:08.269
Will those boys
still be here?

07:08.354 --> 07:09.470
Yes, sir.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.939
Then so will I.

07:12.224 --> 07:15.026
Ok, well, let's find a place
where we can talk.

07:15.093 --> 07:16.060
Come on.

07:16.111 --> 07:18.262
Hit the national news
yesterday.

07:18.314 --> 07:19.447
A lot of pressure.

07:19.532 --> 07:21.783
The mayor would rather have
a great white attacking

07:21.867 --> 07:23.117
than a homicide.

07:23.202 --> 07:25.603
Sure. A shark attack
makes the mayor a victim.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.372
A killer makes him
responsible.

07:27.439 --> 07:28.873
Once she got into that car,

07:28.941 --> 07:30.875
we have no idea what happened.

07:30.943 --> 07:32.544
Well, the suspects'
stories hold up.

07:32.611 --> 07:34.996
They've told them
dozens of times
without variation.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.464
There's got to be
some truth in them.

07:36.549 --> 07:38.633
Syd Pearson is a handful.

07:38.717 --> 07:41.135
Jimmy Barrett is dumber
than a box full of rocks.

07:41.220 --> 07:42.670
But they've been friends
all their lives.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.121
Yeah, go figure.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.590
There's gotta be a reason.

07:45.641 --> 07:47.308
Well, they've only been
out of their holding cells

07:47.393 --> 07:49.360
to be interrogated
or to use the John.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.511
You've got video?

07:50.596 --> 07:52.347
Yeah, we got cameras
in both rooms.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.965
Good. We'll have to rely
on nonverbal cues.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.967
That'll expose
their weaknesses.

07:57.486 --> 07:59.904
Hey, you.

07:59.972 --> 08:00.939
What'd you do with Kate?

08:00.990 --> 08:02.023
Calm down, man.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.141
I will kill you,
you understand?

08:04.193 --> 08:05.443
You understand me?!

08:05.494 --> 08:07.111
Keep them him from me.

08:07.162 --> 08:08.529
Barrett avoided conflict.

08:08.597 --> 08:10.114
Pearson was provocative.

08:10.165 --> 08:11.332
The blond one's
getting off on this.

08:11.417 --> 08:13.952
Well, if he knows where
Kate is, that's his power.

08:19.425 --> 08:21.676
Hey, can I get you anything?

08:21.760 --> 08:23.344
What?

08:23.429 --> 08:25.597
Water? Soda?
Are you hungry?

08:25.664 --> 08:26.965
Hmm.

08:27.016 --> 08:28.216
Starving.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.801
Anything.

08:29.852 --> 08:31.970
Hmm.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.138
Tuggie's roast beef
with fries.

08:34.188 --> 08:35.356
The Curly ones.

08:35.441 --> 08:36.640
You got it.

08:36.692 --> 08:38.142
And a beer.

08:38.193 --> 08:39.143
Nice try.

08:43.616 --> 08:45.366
What the hell
was that?

08:45.451 --> 08:47.452
Just trying to establish
some trust.

08:47.519 --> 08:48.987
Uh-huh.

08:49.038 --> 08:50.905
You gonna ask
the other one, too?

08:50.990 --> 08:52.256
No.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.625
In other words,
you're not going in there.

08:53.692 --> 08:54.742
Not yet.

08:54.827 --> 08:56.961
Hmm. Really?

08:57.029 --> 08:59.080
You know, we don't have
a whole lot of time here.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.883
They've been slammed
with the same questions
for the last 2 1/2 days.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.801
We go in there
with that strategy,
we'll get nowhere.

09:03.869 --> 09:05.136
I don't get it.

09:05.204 --> 09:06.838
If we go in there now,
they have all the power.

09:06.889 --> 09:09.340
So, what, we just wait?

09:10.509 --> 09:12.310
For a while.

09:13.812 --> 09:15.763
Kate Joyce comes from
a stable family.

09:15.848 --> 09:17.849
She went to good schools,
got good grades,

09:17.900 --> 09:19.183
has good friends.

09:19.234 --> 09:22.020
Everything points to her
being a total sweetheart.

09:22.071 --> 09:23.354
You don't think she is?

09:23.405 --> 09:24.522
I'm sure she is.

09:24.573 --> 09:25.556
But?

09:25.607 --> 09:28.026
She's 19.

09:28.077 --> 09:31.863
Everyone agrees--kate wouldn't
leave with those boys.

09:31.914 --> 09:33.197
But she did.

09:33.248 --> 09:35.950
Yeah. But why?

09:36.035 --> 09:38.202
Why would this girl,
this sweetheart,

09:38.253 --> 09:40.071
take such a risk?

09:44.242 --> 09:46.260
We don't have many images
to go by.

09:46.345 --> 09:47.795
We saw enough
to know what happened.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.599
Kate Joyce and her friends
moved around a lot.

09:53.268 --> 09:55.770
The suspects didn't.

09:55.854 --> 09:57.321
They waited for her.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.557
A Sea of opportunity.

09:59.641 --> 09:59.774
Why was she drawn
to those guys?

09:59.858 --> 10:00.441
Er]

10:00.526 --> 10:01.059
The suspects didn't.

10:01.110 --> 10:01.693
They waited for her.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.560
A Sea of opportunity.

10:02.611 --> 10:03.094
Why was she drawn
to those guys?

10:03.896 --> 10:05.396
Her friends
at if she knew I never said that.

10:05.447 --> 10:07.732
She was only
here a week.

10:11.036 --> 10:12.620
I think she trusted them.

10:12.705 --> 10:13.738
Why?

10:13.789 --> 10:15.239
She may have been
testing her boundaries,

10:15.290 --> 10:17.241
but she's far too cautious
to just go off

10:17.292 --> 10:18.743
with total strangers.

10:18.794 --> 10:21.045
So she met them
before Friday night.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.666
Look at her.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.502
Has she always been a fish?

10:27.586 --> 10:29.837
We started her out
in swim lessons

10:29.922 --> 10:31.506
our second summer
down here.

10:31.590 --> 10:34.175
When was that, Jeff, '95?

10:34.259 --> 10:36.310
Who's this? Your son?

10:38.263 --> 10:40.064
Drew.

10:40.132 --> 10:42.683
So they were on
the same swim team,

10:42.751 --> 10:45.653
but he looks like
he's a few years younger?

10:45.738 --> 10:48.272
Was. He had leukemia.

10:51.660 --> 10:53.077
I'm so sorry.

10:53.145 --> 10:57.048
Katie was always
very protective of him.

10:57.116 --> 10:58.750
It hit her the hardest.

10:58.817 --> 11:03.654
♪ Today
is the greatest day ♪

11:03.705 --> 11:07.875
♪ and it don't matter
which day, no way-- ♪

11:07.960 --> 11:09.877
we should have been here.
If we had driven down...

11:09.962 --> 11:11.546
Then she wouldn't have come.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.847
Stop saying that.

11:12.931 --> 11:14.298
It's the truth.
The whole point

11:14.349 --> 11:15.800
was for her to get away.

11:15.851 --> 11:17.051
Get away?

11:17.136 --> 11:18.436
From what, Patty?
From us?

11:18.503 --> 11:19.604
I don't know, Jeff.

11:19.671 --> 11:21.105
She needed a break.

11:21.173 --> 11:22.557
You shouldn't have
let her come.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.508
She's 19 years old.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.010
How was I gonna stop her?

11:26.061 --> 11:27.528
And we said it was ok.

11:27.613 --> 11:29.030
We were wrong.

11:29.114 --> 11:31.365
God, don't you
think I know that?!

11:36.839 --> 11:38.739
I know you're trying
to make sense of this.

11:38.824 --> 11:42.827
Trust me, there is
no logic to any of it.

11:42.878 --> 11:45.580
No. You have no idea,

11:45.664 --> 11:47.999
no idea what it's like.

11:48.050 --> 11:51.969
Our children
were taken from us!

11:53.472 --> 11:55.640
And there is nothing
you can say

11:55.707 --> 11:57.391
that will change that.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.730
You're right.

12:06.235 --> 12:10.655
It's natural
to want to blame someone.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.910
But right now you really
have to hold on to each other.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.003
Garcia, what have you got?

12:26.071 --> 12:28.289
Oodles of records.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.625
Cell phones, credit cards,

12:30.709 --> 12:32.343
some juicy juvie.

12:32.411 --> 12:33.845
Sending details now.

12:33.912 --> 12:36.214
It is safe to say
these two have always
been in trouble.

12:36.265 --> 12:37.298
When did it start?

12:37.382 --> 12:38.716
The summer of 2000.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.417
They were only 10.
What did they do?

12:40.469 --> 12:42.019
See for yourself.

12:42.087 --> 12:43.855
Naughty boys.

12:43.922 --> 12:45.422
Shoplifting,
vandalism,

12:45.474 --> 12:46.924
burned a house down.

12:46.992 --> 12:49.527
Abandoned building.
Fireworks.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.596
Assault charges were
dropped last summer.

12:52.648 --> 12:55.449
Well, it looks like
they bring out the worst
in each other.

12:55.534 --> 12:56.951
Ready?

13:08.947 --> 13:10.481
What's up?

13:10.549 --> 13:12.700
What's up?

13:12.768 --> 13:14.886
My name's Derek Morgan.

13:14.953 --> 13:17.455
I'm with the FBI's
behavioral analysis unit.

13:18.724 --> 13:19.674
What did you do?

13:19.791 --> 13:22.727
Oh, I had this
before Friday night.

13:22.794 --> 13:23.844
That's not what I asked you.

13:23.912 --> 13:25.346
But I know
what you're thinking.

13:25.414 --> 13:27.148
I highly doubt that.

13:32.571 --> 13:36.490
Wow. Division one
lacrosse player.

13:36.575 --> 13:37.992
Obviously left-handed.

13:38.076 --> 13:39.360
Broke it in 3 places.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.079
Ooh. That sucks.

13:42.147 --> 13:43.915
I bet you're a force.

13:43.982 --> 13:47.318
Too bad you didn't dominate
the way they hoped, though.

13:49.588 --> 13:50.922
Why not?

13:50.989 --> 13:52.506
I mean, what happened?
Were you still hung up

13:52.591 --> 13:54.342
on the chapel hill rejection?

13:54.426 --> 13:58.329
I mean, especially after
you told everybody
that you were gonna go.

13:58.380 --> 14:02.166
I mean, damn, that's gotta
sting a little bit.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.269
What's the deal?

14:05.337 --> 14:07.188
Isn't it all
in your little file?

14:08.974 --> 14:10.524
Well, let's see.

14:10.609 --> 14:13.477
My little file says...

14:13.528 --> 14:16.981
You cheated on your SATS
and you had your girlfriend
take them for you.

14:17.032 --> 14:19.183
That's another hard lesson,
isn't it?

14:19.234 --> 14:22.069
You can't trust anybody
to keep their mouth shut.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.357
Why haven't you lawyered up?

14:29.878 --> 14:33.998
I haven't done
anything wrong.

14:39.972 --> 14:42.123
That is so annoying.

14:42.190 --> 14:44.725
Do you know anything
about video cameras?

14:44.793 --> 14:46.510
The battery's
probably dead.

14:46.561 --> 14:48.512
Oh.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.101
Hey, guys.
Can I get a new, uh,

14:54.186 --> 14:55.486
battery for
the video camera?

14:55.553 --> 14:57.021
Ok.

14:58.657 --> 14:59.857
Wow.

14:59.908 --> 15:02.777
What is that, roast beef?

15:02.861 --> 15:05.079
Did anyone ask you?

15:05.163 --> 15:07.114
I'm not hungry.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.500
Neither was I
until I smelled that.

15:09.567 --> 15:11.485
Sorry.

15:11.553 --> 15:13.788
Ok. Um...

15:13.872 --> 15:15.690
So Syd has a Lexus.

15:15.757 --> 15:16.707
That's nice.

15:16.775 --> 15:18.209
Did he ever let you
drive it?

15:18.260 --> 15:19.627
No.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.762
Yeah, he's kind of
a control freak, huh?

15:21.830 --> 15:25.132
I met him.
He seems like a jerk.

15:25.217 --> 15:28.986
And it says a lot
that he can eat
at a time like this.

15:29.054 --> 15:32.723
And he didn't
just get a car.

15:32.774 --> 15:34.392
He got a Lexus.

15:34.443 --> 15:36.277
At 16.

15:36.361 --> 15:40.314
But, well, I guess
that's what lrbs get.

15:40.399 --> 15:42.650
Little rich boys.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.619
His dad's got
a dealership.

15:45.704 --> 15:47.471
Do you always defend Syd?

15:47.539 --> 15:49.573
Defend him?

15:50.909 --> 15:52.743
Never mind.

15:52.794 --> 15:54.545
So I see you have a boat.

15:54.612 --> 15:57.498
Single outboard motor,
two-stroke engine.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.749
Is it fast?

15:58.800 --> 16:00.167
Yeah.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.669
25...

16:01.753 --> 16:02.786
30.

16:02.838 --> 16:06.690
So, when did your family
move here?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.592
I don't remember.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.729
Grade school?
Middle school?

16:11.796 --> 16:12.847
Fifth grade.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.266
So you were 10.

16:15.317 --> 16:17.568
That's the year
you met Syd.

16:17.636 --> 16:19.887
How does any of this
have to do with that girl?

16:19.955 --> 16:21.439
He never mentions her
by name.

16:21.506 --> 16:22.440
Why not?

16:22.491 --> 16:23.524
He's distancing himself.

16:23.592 --> 16:25.559
Depersonalizing
the victim.

16:25.627 --> 16:27.328
You want to talk
about Kate?

16:27.412 --> 16:29.330
I didn't know her.

16:29.414 --> 16:31.248
You brought her up.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.419
See the way he shifted his
weight and cracked his neck?

16:35.487 --> 16:38.589
His behavior was consistent
until Kate was mentioned.

16:43.178 --> 16:45.846
Your statement says that
you and Jimmy first met Kate

16:45.931 --> 16:48.682
on Friday night.

16:48.767 --> 16:52.002
These are Kate's
credit card receipts.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.721
Her and her friends
rented a jet ski

16:53.805 --> 16:55.022
from Jimmy Friday morning.

16:55.107 --> 16:56.724
Mm-hmm. He gets
100 customers a day.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.058
Yeah, but come on, man.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.644
I doubt they all look
like Kate, now, do they?

17:00.695 --> 17:02.396
Hmm?

17:02.481 --> 17:05.232
Isn't that really why Jimmy
ttexted you Friday morning?

17:05.317 --> 17:06.567
Woke you up and said,
hey, man,

17:06.651 --> 17:08.402
you gotta get down here
and see this girl.

17:08.487 --> 17:11.122
And you liked what you saw,
didn't you?

17:11.189 --> 17:12.573
You invite her to the club,

17:12.656 --> 17:14.191
and maybe that would
have been all right,
but the problem is,

17:14.259 --> 17:16.410
when you and Jimmy
get together,
it's nothing but trouble.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.963
And when you add a girl
to that mix,

17:19.030 --> 17:21.582
she didn't stand a chance,
did she?

17:21.665 --> 17:24.919
Just like kelley graybeal.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.703
Last summer.
Who?

17:26.755 --> 17:28.872
She filed a complaint,
but lucky for you

17:28.924 --> 17:30.674
she dropped all the charges.

17:30.725 --> 17:32.176
Look, man, we could do this
for another,

17:32.227 --> 17:34.478
I don't know,
whatever you got left...

17:34.546 --> 17:36.147
Or, I could make it...

17:37.215 --> 17:38.682
Real simple for you.

17:38.733 --> 17:40.518
Give me a polygraph.

17:40.569 --> 17:43.554
After 65 hours
of sitting in here,
you want a polygraph?

17:43.605 --> 17:44.939
Well, that depends.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.073
On what?

17:46.158 --> 17:48.325
Are you gonna ask me
the questions?

17:48.393 --> 17:49.894
'Cause I was really
hoping

17:49.961 --> 17:52.530
you'd send that
pretty one back in here.

17:54.266 --> 17:55.833
You guys hear that?

17:55.900 --> 17:57.501
Barrett just asked
for a polygraph.

17:57.569 --> 17:59.403
You're kidding me.
Him, too?

18:09.835 --> 18:12.987
I don't understand why those boys
agreed to a polygraph.

18:13.038 --> 18:15.456
They didn't.
They suggested it.

18:15.507 --> 18:17.708
It's a countermeasure.
They're trying to manage
perceptions

18:17.793 --> 18:20.711
trying to prove they don't
have anything to hide.

18:20.796 --> 18:23.330
They know where Kate is
right now.

18:24.516 --> 18:27.168
Well, we don't know that
for sure.

18:29.888 --> 18:32.723
All right, um...

18:32.808 --> 18:36.477
Why don't we head
to the hotel, ok?

18:36.528 --> 18:39.780
We could go and look
at the ocean.

18:39.848 --> 18:42.483
I can't believe you're thinking
about a view right now.

18:42.534 --> 18:44.569
You just said--
I'm not.

18:44.653 --> 18:45.736
Because it calms you.

18:45.821 --> 18:48.473
Ok, you guys haven't been
outside for days.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.541
You haven't eaten.
You haven't slept.

18:50.626 --> 18:52.359
You cannot keep going
like this.

18:52.461 --> 18:53.694
You go ahead.

19:04.806 --> 19:07.692
We think Kate was
comfortable with these guys.

19:07.759 --> 19:10.711
How? Their only other encounter
was at the jet ski rental.

19:10.779 --> 19:12.096
The only documented
encounter.

19:12.164 --> 19:15.216
Garcia's running her
friends' credit cards, too.

19:15.267 --> 19:17.518
They could have met
someplace else.

19:17.569 --> 19:19.270
I don't know.
She's a smart girl.

19:19.354 --> 19:21.822
Well, they're handsome,
charming, 19.

19:21.890 --> 19:23.107
You remember 19?

19:23.192 --> 19:25.409
She would know better
than to be outnumbered.

19:25.494 --> 19:27.945
What if Pearson promised
to dump Jim Barrett?

19:28.030 --> 19:30.397
And, what,
Jim retaliated?

19:30.449 --> 19:31.832
I could work that theory.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.035
When do we
get the results?

19:34.086 --> 19:35.453
Any minute.

19:35.537 --> 19:37.972
So, what if they
didn't do it?

19:38.040 --> 19:39.423
Then we're back
to nothing?

19:39.508 --> 19:41.175
One of them knows
where Kate is.

19:41.243 --> 19:42.409
How can you be sure?

19:42.461 --> 19:43.794
Because an innocent person
doesn't sit quietly

19:43.879 --> 19:45.913
for 3 days. They get angry
and defensive.

19:45.964 --> 19:47.798
These guys are going
out of their way
to appear calm

19:47.883 --> 19:49.383
and in control.
They've got
something to hide.

19:49.434 --> 19:50.635
Then why take the polygraph?

19:50.719 --> 19:51.919
'Cause they're stalling.

19:51.970 --> 19:53.888
Serial killers are kings
of manipulation.

19:53.939 --> 19:57.141
Serial killers?
Uh, there's only one
potential victim.

19:57.226 --> 19:58.643
Serial killing
is a qualitative
characteristic.

19:58.727 --> 19:59.860
It not just
about numbers.

19:59.928 --> 20:02.196
They've assaulted at least
one girl before.

20:02.264 --> 20:04.532
It was only a matter of time
before they did it again.

20:04.599 --> 20:06.367
Barrett's a perfect
match for Pearson.

20:06.435 --> 20:08.035
His family uprooted
from the city,

20:08.103 --> 20:09.237
forcing him to adapt

20:09.288 --> 20:10.938
to his new surroundings.
He's eager to fit in

20:10.989 --> 20:12.240
and quick to follow.

20:12.291 --> 20:13.908
And Pearson's definitely
got the dominant traits.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.826
He's loud, he's physical,
he's smart,

20:15.911 --> 20:18.246
he's charismatic,
and he's privileged.

20:18.297 --> 20:19.664
Sounds like a peach.

20:19.731 --> 20:20.665
You should talk to him.

20:20.749 --> 20:21.666
Love to.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.451
I'll take you to him.

20:24.670 --> 20:26.754
JJ, how are the Joyces
doing?

20:26.805 --> 20:28.673
They lost their son
3 years ago.

20:30.342 --> 20:32.893
If we can't find Kate...

20:32.961 --> 20:34.962
If Kate knew these boys
better than we thought,

20:35.013 --> 20:36.847
you might want
to dig a little.

20:36.915 --> 20:38.299
Dig?

20:38.350 --> 20:40.151
If the family thinks
it could help, they may
reveal something.

20:40.235 --> 20:41.802
I know. It's just...

20:41.853 --> 20:44.471
They shouldn't have to.

20:44.523 --> 20:46.774
Hotch, we can't lose her.

20:46.825 --> 20:48.242
Strauss thinks
we're all replaceable.

20:48.310 --> 20:52.697
I went over her head
to try to explain
that we're not.

20:56.868 --> 20:58.319
Are you the bad cop?

21:02.040 --> 21:03.341
I'm not a cop.

21:05.877 --> 21:09.096
Sydney Xavier Pearson.

21:09.164 --> 21:12.016
A name like that
didn't come with manners?

21:12.100 --> 21:13.934
A gentleman walks a Lady
to the door.

21:14.002 --> 21:15.770
She wasn't much of a Lady.

21:15.837 --> 21:16.937
Watch your mouth.

21:17.005 --> 21:18.005
The girl was horny, man.

21:18.073 --> 21:20.107
I mean, she practically
begged me for it.

21:20.175 --> 21:22.343
The son of a bitch passed.
That's a bunch of bull--

21:24.563 --> 21:26.314
how?

21:26.365 --> 21:27.514
How'd you do it?

21:27.566 --> 21:29.600
Bastard believes
his lies are the truth.

21:29.668 --> 21:32.036
Takes a few deep breaths
and passes.

21:33.488 --> 21:36.040
Old-timer's kind of
dramatic, isn't he?

21:36.124 --> 21:38.793
You know, it's actually
much simpler than that.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.127
You see, uh,

21:40.195 --> 21:43.364
I didn't actually
do anything to her.

21:43.415 --> 21:46.634
You didn't do anything?
You gave me some pretty
graphic details.

21:46.701 --> 21:48.219
Oh, don't get me wrong.

21:48.303 --> 21:51.138
My DNA is...

21:51.206 --> 21:53.491
All over that girl,
but, uh,

21:53.558 --> 21:55.259
that doesn't mean
I killed her.

21:57.879 --> 21:59.580
I got pictures.

21:59.648 --> 22:00.564
What?

22:00.649 --> 22:01.982
On my cell.

22:02.050 --> 22:03.601
You want to see?

22:03.685 --> 22:06.487
You're giving us consent?

22:06.554 --> 22:10.891
Give me this guy's
property! Now!

22:10.942 --> 22:12.326
What the hell was that?

22:12.394 --> 22:13.894
That was the camera.

22:13.945 --> 22:15.913
No, the yelling.

22:15.997 --> 22:18.833
That was Agent Morgan.

22:18.900 --> 22:21.752
Barrett, it says here
you were half an hour late

22:21.837 --> 22:23.788
to work on Saturday morning.

22:23.872 --> 22:25.539
I was hung-over.

22:25.590 --> 22:27.425
Hung-over?
That's nothing new,

22:27.509 --> 22:28.759
but being late is.

22:28.844 --> 22:31.262
It looks like you always
clock in 10 minutes early,

22:31.346 --> 22:33.347
gas up the jet skis,
get the life vests out.

22:33.415 --> 22:34.615
What happened that morning?

22:34.683 --> 22:37.201
I just told you.
I was hung-over.

22:37.269 --> 22:38.352
Got you. Hung-over,

22:38.420 --> 22:40.104
slept in.

22:40.188 --> 22:41.588
What about Friday night,

22:41.640 --> 22:43.274
Friday after the bar?

22:43.341 --> 22:44.558
We drove to the inlet.

22:44.609 --> 22:46.927
Drove to the inlet.
Approximately what time

22:46.995 --> 22:49.397
would you say
you drove to the inlet?

22:49.464 --> 22:51.198
2:00, 2:30.

22:51.266 --> 22:54.268
Why would you go to the water
at 2:00 or 2:30 in the morning?

22:54.336 --> 22:56.420
The boats start coming in.

22:56.488 --> 22:58.406
In the middle of the night
the boats start coming in?

22:58.473 --> 23:00.458
Yeah. They fish all night,

23:00.542 --> 23:02.042
then they bring in
the catch.

23:02.110 --> 23:03.294
Then they sell it
on the docks

23:03.378 --> 23:04.795
to the restaurants
and all that.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.281
Syd wanted to show her,
then he drove her back,

23:07.332 --> 23:09.133
dropped her off
at the hotel,

23:09.217 --> 23:11.619
and the next thing
I know, it's morning.

23:11.686 --> 23:13.104
And you slept in?

23:13.171 --> 23:15.155
My alarm clock's broken.

23:15.207 --> 23:18.092
Broken.
Your alarm clock's broken?

23:19.428 --> 23:20.628
Broken.

23:20.679 --> 23:22.680
Did it make you upset?

23:23.849 --> 23:27.218
Can you fix the damn
camera, please?!

23:28.520 --> 23:30.104
Sit down.

23:35.861 --> 23:37.177
How'd you pass it?

23:43.201 --> 23:45.152
All right.

23:45.203 --> 23:48.489
Now, a gentleman
never shares,

23:48.540 --> 23:49.907
but...

23:49.975 --> 23:52.192
See?

23:53.378 --> 23:55.329
No tears.

24:04.890 --> 24:07.992
Now, you see how happy
she was?

24:08.059 --> 24:09.326
Did Kate drink often?

24:09.394 --> 24:11.545
I told you,
she's an athlete.

24:11.596 --> 24:13.347
Were you surprised
she had a fake I.D.?

24:13.398 --> 24:15.516
It's no secret.
She liked going out
with her friends.

24:15.567 --> 24:16.717
Why are you doing this?

24:16.768 --> 24:18.185
I'm not judging Kate.

24:18.236 --> 24:19.820
I want to find her.

24:21.606 --> 24:22.990
What time is it?

24:27.612 --> 24:28.612
7:30.

24:33.535 --> 24:34.835
It's almost dark out.

24:34.903 --> 24:38.071
We can't do this anymore.
Please just find her.

24:40.792 --> 24:41.742
Where is she?

24:41.793 --> 24:42.877
I don't know.

24:42.944 --> 24:44.378
Where is Kate Joyce?

24:44.429 --> 24:45.880
You got a hair
or something?

24:45.931 --> 24:47.515
You know what
I don't get it, rossi,

24:47.582 --> 24:49.383
what I just can't wrap
my brain around?

24:49.434 --> 24:50.467
No, what's that?

24:50.552 --> 24:52.636
How this could have been
consensual.

24:52.721 --> 24:55.088
Don't sit down.
Don't sit down.

24:55.140 --> 24:58.142
Consensual, huh?

24:58.226 --> 25:00.561
What does that look like?

25:00.612 --> 25:02.479
How do you get
a nice girl like Kate

25:02.564 --> 25:04.064
to do both of you
in the same night?

25:04.132 --> 25:06.116
She liked it.

25:06.201 --> 25:07.985
What did she like?

25:08.069 --> 25:11.038
What, did she do
both of you at once?

25:11.105 --> 25:12.706
Come on, you know that.

25:12.774 --> 25:14.375
Did you take turns? What?

25:14.442 --> 25:16.276
I mean, you said
she liked it.

25:16.328 --> 25:17.995
But what?
What did she like?

25:18.079 --> 25:18.996
You know, man.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.714
No, I don't.

25:20.782 --> 25:22.666
Is this what
you did to her? Hmm?

25:22.751 --> 25:24.084
You pin her down?

25:24.152 --> 25:26.253
I told you,
she liked it.

25:26.304 --> 25:27.788
You held her
just like this.

25:27.839 --> 25:29.056
You choked her.

25:29.123 --> 25:31.892
Well, how long
before she tapped out?

25:31.960 --> 25:35.462
This is exactly
what you did to her.

25:35.530 --> 25:37.765
You know what I think, Syd?

25:37.832 --> 25:40.651
I think Kate didn't
want to fool around
with your friend.

25:40.719 --> 25:42.820
So she begged you
to take her home.

25:42.904 --> 25:46.807
But you couldn't diss
your boy like that, could you?

25:46.875 --> 25:49.560
So you helped him.

25:49.628 --> 25:52.563
Pinned her down
in the backseat.

25:52.631 --> 25:55.749
Maybe you threw her out
in the dirt.

25:55.817 --> 25:58.836
Maybe you hit her too hard,

25:58.920 --> 26:00.137
she stopped breathing,

26:00.205 --> 26:02.790
you were stuck, weren't you?

26:02.857 --> 26:04.141
It's not true.

26:04.209 --> 26:06.427
Is that what you mean
by consensual?

26:08.513 --> 26:10.831
They sure know how
to run out the clock.

26:10.882 --> 26:13.166
Yeah. What have we got?

26:13.218 --> 26:16.053
Less than 3 hours.

26:16.137 --> 26:18.005
What do you think?

26:18.056 --> 26:20.774
Well, he's not smart enough
to have done this by himself.

26:20.842 --> 26:22.843
He's always been a follower.

26:22.894 --> 26:25.112
Pearson's charming enough
to pick up a good girl,

26:25.179 --> 26:27.064
but Barrett was just along
for the ride.

26:27.148 --> 26:28.682
Take a look at the photos.

26:33.722 --> 26:36.457
Oh, she wasn't interested
in Barrett at all.

26:36.524 --> 26:38.659
But he's the one
she met in the morning.

26:38.710 --> 26:40.127
All right.
Well, I'll keep pushing.

26:40.194 --> 26:41.245
How's it going in there?

26:43.415 --> 26:46.250
I wouldn't be surprised
if Morgan turned off
the camera in a minute.

26:49.170 --> 26:52.640
I told you,
Agent Jareau's transfer

26:52.707 --> 26:54.875
is an executive decision.

26:54.926 --> 26:57.144
Ma'am, I'm asking you
not to take it out
on Agent Jareau

26:57.211 --> 26:58.595
because I went
over your head.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.981
I know this is emotional
for you--

27:01.049 --> 27:02.549
it's not emotional.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.385
It's a bad decision.
She's a vital member
of our team.

27:05.437 --> 27:07.521
I'm afraid it's a done deal.

27:08.940 --> 27:10.324
That's unacceptable.

27:10.391 --> 27:12.993
Well, what do you
want me to do, Aaron,

27:13.061 --> 27:15.195
lose my job
so she can keep hers?

27:15.246 --> 27:16.914
And I have no say
in this?

27:16.998 --> 27:18.332
You don't get it.

27:18.399 --> 27:19.667
They're not asking you.

27:19.734 --> 27:23.904
They want her back
in D.C. now.

27:33.882 --> 27:36.233
What do you think?

27:37.986 --> 27:39.504
I don't know.

27:39.571 --> 27:41.989
This kid's got no shame.

27:42.074 --> 27:43.408
No guilt.

27:43.459 --> 27:46.627
He did horrible things
to Kate, but...

27:46.712 --> 27:48.413
I don't think
he killed her.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.598
So what are we saying?
The only thing he's guilty of

27:50.666 --> 27:52.049
is being a scumbag?

27:53.669 --> 27:55.453
Any official charge for that?

27:55.504 --> 27:58.506
The storm came through
and separated the land.

27:58.590 --> 28:00.124
That's what made the inlet.

28:00.175 --> 28:01.509
Huh.

28:01.593 --> 28:04.679
One thing you can trust
is the ground beneath you,

28:04.763 --> 28:07.181
until one day
it all just shifts.

28:07.266 --> 28:09.233
Is that some kind
of a metaphor?

28:14.006 --> 28:15.940
You tell me.

28:18.810 --> 28:21.913
It sounds like you're just
trying to make some fancy point.

28:21.980 --> 28:23.498
That's all.

28:28.170 --> 28:29.587
He's smarter
than you thought.

28:29.654 --> 28:31.589
He never says
the word water.

28:31.657 --> 28:33.241
He always talks about
the inlet.

28:33.308 --> 28:35.993
Well, he's a local kid.
He knows the specifics
about the island.

28:36.044 --> 28:36.994
He's getting sloppy.

28:37.045 --> 28:38.930
You think it's all an act?

28:38.997 --> 28:40.664
Barrett's never said her name.

28:40.716 --> 28:42.750
He's fidgety, looks like
he's a submissive,

28:42.818 --> 28:44.635
but he's not
entirely weak.

28:44.703 --> 28:47.305
He doesn't have
the looks or confidence
to pull this off,

28:47.356 --> 28:49.257
so he calls Syd
to seal the deal.

28:49.324 --> 28:51.509
We saw the pictures.
Kate rejected Barrett.

28:51.560 --> 28:52.994
What pictures?

28:55.047 --> 28:57.014
How does Barrett
pass a polygraph?

28:57.065 --> 28:58.766
Even if he didn't
kill her...

28:58.834 --> 29:00.785
He'd have to make sure
she's never found.

29:00.852 --> 29:01.986
He's got a boat.

29:02.037 --> 29:03.454
The locals checked it.

29:03.522 --> 29:05.189
No sign Kate was ever on it.

29:05.257 --> 29:06.457
Wouldn't a boat have GPS?

29:06.542 --> 29:08.192
That's Kate's phone.

29:08.243 --> 29:11.162
There, in the backseat.

29:11.213 --> 29:12.797
Kate's mom has that
right now.

29:12.864 --> 29:13.965
You sure?

29:14.032 --> 29:15.883
Yeah. They recovered
that from her room.

29:17.869 --> 29:21.255
So she made it back.

29:21.373 --> 29:23.007
Kate's cell phone
was left in the car

29:23.075 --> 29:24.775
and then later
turned up in her room.

29:24.843 --> 29:25.793
How?

29:25.861 --> 29:26.961
We figure most of
the story's true.

29:27.029 --> 29:28.229
That's why they
never changed it.

29:28.313 --> 29:29.897
They did drop Kate off
at the hotel.

29:29.982 --> 29:32.183
Pearson took Barrett home,
just like they said.

29:32.234 --> 29:33.601
But then because
Barrett was rejected,

29:33.685 --> 29:35.353
he circled back
to punish Kate.

29:35.404 --> 29:37.355
Well, why would she
let him in?

29:37.406 --> 29:38.739
Because he had this.

29:38.824 --> 29:40.224
No sign of a struggle
in the room.

29:40.275 --> 29:42.076
Barrett
lured her outside,

29:42.160 --> 29:43.861
maybe drugged her,
took her to his boat.

29:43.912 --> 29:45.413
He was obsessed with the inlet.

29:45.497 --> 29:47.532
He knew the traffic patterns
there, when the fishermen
were coming in

29:47.583 --> 29:48.916
and tourist charters
were going out.

29:49.001 --> 29:51.118
The blood from the catch
attracts hundreds of sharks.

29:51.203 --> 29:54.956
It's a feeding frenzy
out there
that time of night.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.924
We asked him
if he killed her.

29:57.009 --> 29:58.342
He didn't.

29:58.410 --> 30:00.428
Asked where her body is.
He doesn't know.

30:00.512 --> 30:02.179
Technically,
those aren't lies.

30:02.247 --> 30:04.015
How can you prove this?

30:04.082 --> 30:06.350
We'll get them to admit it.

30:11.256 --> 30:14.275
This was after you dropped Kate
at the motel. Agreed?

30:14.359 --> 30:16.394
Yes.

30:16.445 --> 30:18.529
Victory picture.

30:18.597 --> 30:21.782
So Kate's gone,
but her phone is right there.

30:21.867 --> 30:23.985
And?

30:24.052 --> 30:26.237
We found it in her room.
You got any idea
how it got there?

30:33.211 --> 30:36.797
Why is the GPS
on your boat missing?

30:38.050 --> 30:39.383
It isn't.

30:39.451 --> 30:41.085
He tossed it
after he dumped Kate.

30:41.136 --> 30:42.253
Who are you?

30:42.321 --> 30:43.787
This.

30:43.839 --> 30:46.974
This was your ticket
into her room.

30:48.644 --> 30:49.927
Who is she?

30:49.978 --> 30:51.345
You said the inlet's quiet
between 4:00 and 5 A.M.

30:51.430 --> 30:53.297
That's when you took
Kate out, right?

30:53.348 --> 30:55.082
You didn't want the search
party to find her,

30:55.150 --> 30:57.401
so you kept going.
And going.

30:57.469 --> 30:59.570
You had 6 hours
before work.

30:59.638 --> 31:00.938
How far did you get?

31:00.989 --> 31:02.573
About 75 miles out?

31:02.641 --> 31:04.158
A full tank
on a single outboard motor

31:04.276 --> 31:05.743
will get you 150 miles.
At 25 miles per hour,

31:05.810 --> 31:07.345
your round trip
took just over 6 hours.

31:07.412 --> 31:09.280
Which is why
you were late for work.

31:09.331 --> 31:11.032
Oh, you didn't kill her.

31:11.116 --> 31:12.833
You just left her
to die.

31:12.918 --> 31:14.352
That's why you asked
for a polygraph.

31:14.419 --> 31:16.787
You knew you'd pass it.

31:16.838 --> 31:18.873
Why did you take Kate
to the inlet?

31:18.957 --> 31:20.541
To look at the boats.

31:20.626 --> 31:22.259
Come on, man, you know
what happens down there

31:22.327 --> 31:23.461
in the middle of the night.

31:23.512 --> 31:24.879
Sharks happen, Syd.

31:24.963 --> 31:27.048
And they clean up
your mess, don't they?

31:27.132 --> 31:29.133
That's why you dumped
her body out there.

31:29.184 --> 31:30.718
Did you dump her?
No.

31:30.802 --> 31:32.603
No! What?

31:32.671 --> 31:33.604
God...

31:33.672 --> 31:35.139
No, I didn't
do that, man.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.677
I didn't--I didn't--
I mean, I didn't do that.

31:44.366 --> 31:45.866
I think your time's up.

31:45.951 --> 31:49.153
Oh, yeah? Well,
you took away
their daughter,

31:49.204 --> 31:50.655
their dignity.

31:50.706 --> 31:52.123
You don't get to win.

31:52.190 --> 31:53.391
We're going to find her.

31:53.458 --> 31:56.127
You still think
she has a chance, huh?

32:14.096 --> 32:17.047
Right. Thank you.

32:17.149 --> 32:18.599
Coast Guard's 70 miles out.

32:18.684 --> 32:19.767
No sign of her.

32:19.851 --> 32:20.985
Kate's an amazing swimmer.

32:21.052 --> 32:22.937
If he didn't kill her
when she hit the water,

32:23.021 --> 32:24.372
there's still a chance.

32:24.439 --> 32:26.524
JJ, that's 3 days
in the ocean.

32:26.575 --> 32:28.359
I know.

32:28.410 --> 32:30.277
I know.

32:35.083 --> 32:38.169
Help! Help!
Someone help me!

32:38.236 --> 32:40.421
Help!

32:40.505 --> 32:43.007
Please help me!

32:43.074 --> 32:44.258
Agent Hotchner.

32:45.577 --> 32:47.461
They found her,
hugging a buoy.

32:47.546 --> 32:49.046
She's alive.

32:50.549 --> 32:52.800
Oh, she did it.

32:52.884 --> 32:54.769
She held on.

33:08.233 --> 33:10.868
They found her.
She's alive.

33:30.568 --> 33:32.185
You know the first
thing she said?

33:34.385 --> 33:37.137
She's sorry.

33:37.923 --> 33:39.056
They choked her.

33:39.140 --> 33:40.591
They...

33:42.127 --> 33:45.095
And she's sorry.

33:50.485 --> 33:54.555
You saved my life.

33:54.623 --> 33:57.724
I knew it wouldn't be fair
to leave her alone, but...

33:58.810 --> 34:01.161
I didn't want to live.

34:03.415 --> 34:05.499
It's my little girl.

34:05.567 --> 34:09.103
And it's my job
to keep her safe, and...

34:09.170 --> 34:11.272
I wasn't there.

34:11.339 --> 34:13.958
You made her who she is.

34:15.260 --> 34:18.245
She hung on
in the middle of the ocean

34:18.295 --> 34:19.880
for days.

34:19.931 --> 34:22.600
That's strength
I've never seen before.

34:25.270 --> 34:26.971
I want Kate to meet you.

34:27.054 --> 34:29.056
I'd like that.

34:29.123 --> 34:31.108
Thank you.

34:37.949 --> 34:40.818
I'd like to think that...

34:40.902 --> 34:44.288
That your son
was watching out for her.

35:26.981 --> 35:29.366
When do I leave?

35:29.451 --> 35:31.535
The end of the week.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.871
What?

35:33.955 --> 35:36.340
They wanted you
to start tomorrow.

35:36.424 --> 35:38.876
No, I--I can't.
I need to train someone.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.511
I'm not replacing you.

35:40.595 --> 35:42.713
No, Hotch, you can't
take this on yourself.

35:42.797 --> 35:44.164
Your hands are full.

35:44.215 --> 35:45.633
We'll figure it out.

35:45.684 --> 35:47.768
I'm hoping
I can get you back.

35:50.271 --> 35:52.606
Strauss wanted you
to fill this out.

35:54.509 --> 35:55.659
Exit interview.

35:55.727 --> 35:57.227
Are you kidding me?

35:57.312 --> 35:59.279
She's big on procedure.

36:01.182 --> 36:02.916
Just be honest.

36:05.654 --> 36:09.707
I was hoping I could
do something about this.

36:09.791 --> 36:12.242
And I'm sorry I couldn't.

36:12.327 --> 36:14.828
I know.

36:20.085 --> 36:22.469
How am I supposed
to tell them I'm leaving

36:22.537 --> 36:24.371
when I don't want to go?

36:25.540 --> 36:27.057
The brass is really,
really good

36:27.142 --> 36:30.427
at taking power away.
It makes them feel like
they're in charge.

36:30.512 --> 36:32.546
That sounds like a profile.

36:32.597 --> 36:37.718
You're going to be
much better off than
any of us, you know that?

36:40.939 --> 36:42.489
I'll miss you.

37:33.908 --> 37:35.292
No.

37:36.778 --> 37:39.463
Wait a minute. I thought
Hotch was supposed to--

37:39.547 --> 37:40.881
it's above his pay grade.

37:40.948 --> 37:42.316
Strauss', too.

37:43.968 --> 37:46.136
They can just
take you away?

37:46.221 --> 37:49.389
So, we do nothing?

37:49.457 --> 37:51.391
It's done.

37:51.459 --> 37:52.793
It can't
be that simple.

37:52.844 --> 37:53.794
It is.

37:53.845 --> 37:55.479
This job is hard enough.

37:55.563 --> 37:57.314
What are they trying
to do, bury us?

37:57.398 --> 37:58.982
You're too good.

37:59.067 --> 38:00.517
That's the problem.

38:00.602 --> 38:03.854
It's true. You're on
everybody's wish list.

38:03.922 --> 38:06.073
Our loss is
somebody else's gain.

38:09.077 --> 38:12.696
They can't just
take you away.

38:31.199 --> 38:32.416
You still here?

38:35.820 --> 38:37.704
I figured you'd
get to me eventually.

38:39.607 --> 38:41.175
You're leaving?

38:43.194 --> 38:45.813
You could have told me.
I would have done something.

38:45.864 --> 38:47.314
I would have made it
impossible for them
to let you go.

38:47.365 --> 38:48.899
I would have put
something in your file.

38:48.983 --> 38:50.818
It's not up to me.

38:50.869 --> 38:51.985
Or Hotch.

38:52.036 --> 38:53.821
Don't they understand
that we're a family?

38:53.872 --> 38:56.373
That that's why this works,
is because we're a family.

38:56.441 --> 38:57.391
Do they even care?

38:57.458 --> 38:59.293
I don't know.

39:00.995 --> 39:03.931
I can't believe...

39:03.998 --> 39:05.415
Ok, no, that's--

39:05.500 --> 39:08.719
I'm supposed to say
that this is a great
opportunity,

39:08.803 --> 39:10.687
which it is.

39:12.056 --> 39:14.725
I don't know the way
this place works
without you.

39:14.809 --> 39:16.326
You're like
the glue around here

39:16.394 --> 39:18.345
who's gonna make us
feel safe.

39:18.396 --> 39:22.349
There's plenty of big,
strong men around.

39:22.400 --> 39:23.934
See that, right there?

39:24.018 --> 39:26.353
Your total ignorance
of how awesome you are

39:26.404 --> 39:29.573
is one of the 5,000 things
I love about you.

39:29.657 --> 39:32.359
I'm still gonna be
in the city, ok?

39:32.427 --> 39:34.194
More than normal, probably.

39:34.245 --> 39:35.412
Sure.

39:35.496 --> 39:37.531
And we'll make a plan.

39:37.582 --> 39:40.033
Breakfast every Tuesday.

39:40.084 --> 39:41.668
And life gets in the way.

39:41.736 --> 39:44.671
And what if I only see you
on birthdays and holidays?

39:44.739 --> 39:47.407
I won't let that happen.

39:47.458 --> 39:48.709
Ok.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.961
You better not,
because I know
where to find you.

39:51.045 --> 39:52.746
Yeah.

39:56.701 --> 39:58.969
Ok.

39:59.971 --> 40:01.605
We'll walk out together.

40:01.689 --> 40:04.358
Uh...There's--there's
one more thing

40:04.425 --> 40:05.943
I need to do
before I go.

40:06.027 --> 40:07.227
Oh.

40:09.447 --> 40:10.664

41:57.438 --> 42:00.540
I'll take the best

42:00.591 --> 42:04.544
and lead by their example

42:04.595 --> 42:07.547
A friend told me

Maybe it's because I look
at everything as a lesson.

42:18.443 --> 42:23.030
Or because I don't want
to walk around angry.

42:23.081 --> 42:26.833
Or maybe it's because
I finally understand.

42:26.901 --> 42:29.903
There are things
we don't want to happen

Things we don't want to know

42:37.912 --> 42:39.846
And people
