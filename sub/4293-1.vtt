Jud?

01:00.048 --> 01:02.374
What?

01:02.468 --> 01:04.795
Yer'd better get up.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.142
The alarm's gone off, yer know.

01:15.236 --> 01:17.729
Do you think I don't know?

01:20.661 --> 01:22.819
- Jud?
- What?

01:23.664 --> 01:26.335
- You'll be late.

01:27.628 --> 01:30.664
- Clock's not fast, yer know.
- I said, shut it.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.595
- Give over. That hurts!
- Well, shut it, then.

01:33.679 --> 01:35.880

01:35.974 --> 01:38.466
Shut yer stinkin' mouth.

01:45.195 --> 01:47.479
Oh, Christ!

01:50.243 --> 01:53.321
- Set clock on for me, Jud. For seven.
- Set it yerself.

01:53.415 --> 01:55.490
Go on, you're up.

01:58.088 --> 02:00.581
Hands off cocks; on socks.

02:03.638 --> 02:06.631
You rotten sod!
Just because you've to get up!

02:06.725 --> 02:10.053
- Another few weeks, you'll be up with me.
- I'll not.

02:10.145 --> 02:13.641

- No, cos I'm not gonna work down the pit.

02:13.735 --> 02:16.937
- Where are yer gonna work?
- I don't know, but not down the pit.

02:17.031 --> 02:19.107
No. And have I to tell yer why?

02:19.619 --> 02:23.405
For one thing, you've to be able
to read and write before they set yer on.

02:23.499 --> 02:26.336
And they wouldn't have
a weedy little twat like thee.

02:26.419 --> 02:30.039
- Switch t'light out, then.
- Switch it out yerself.

03:58.549 --> 04:00.833
Me billicking bike!

05:38.899 --> 05:41.767
- I thought you weren't coming.
- Why? I'm not late, am I?

05:41.860 --> 05:44.187
Very near.

05:44.281 --> 05:47.817
- I nearly was, though.
- What do yer mean?

05:47.911 --> 05:50.071
Our Jud, he's taken t'bike.

05:50.165 --> 05:52.240
- What you gonna do, then?
- Walk it.

05:52.334 --> 05:55.954
- How long d'yer think that's gonna take?
- It'll not take me long.

05:56.047 --> 06:00.752
There's a waiting list a mile long
for that job. Good lads, too, most of 'em.

06:00.846 --> 06:04.893
- From up Firs Hill, round there.
- I haven't let you down, have I?

06:05.477 --> 06:07.720
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'. Not very promisin'.

06:07.814 --> 06:10.683
- A bit on the nippy side as well, I think.
- Aye.

06:10.777 --> 06:13.530
- 20 Players tipped, please.
- Oh, right.

06:13.613 --> 06:17.943
- I've not got 20. Will two tens do?
- Yes. That'll be quite all right, thank you.

06:18.955 --> 06:21.573
Thank you. Right. Cheerio.

06:21.666 --> 06:24.035
- Cheerio. Good mornin', sir.
- Good mornin'.

06:24.129 --> 06:26.372
You know what they said
when I took you on?

06:26.466 --> 06:31.806
"You'll have to keep yer eyes open now.
He'll take yer breath if you're not careful."

06:31.890 --> 06:36.552
- I haven't taken owt of yours yet, have I?
- I haven't given you a chance, that's why.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.682
You don't have to.
I haven't been nicking for ages now.

06:39.776 --> 06:42.895
- Ah, well, don't stand about all day.
- I'm goin'.

07:58.762 --> 08:01.047
- How tha goin' on?
- Not so bad.

08:01.141 --> 08:03.299
Get one of these. Better than walkin'.

08:03.393 --> 08:06.064
Only just. I could go
faster on a kid's scooter.

08:06.147 --> 08:10.935
Tha knows what I always say; third-class
ridin's better than first-class walkin'.

08:11.029 --> 08:13.314
Third-class ridin'? In that ramshack?

08:13.408 --> 08:18.070
Ramshack? This is one of best models
t'dairy's got. Cheeky! Sithee tomorrow.

08:18.164 --> 08:22.577
- Can only go 20 mile an hour, as it is.
- Tha's got too much rattle, thee.

08:56.886 --> 09:00.630
"Desperate Dan is stronger than all,
but this opponent makes him fall."

09:00.975 --> 09:04.009
"- Right! Where do you want to fight?
- Right here!"

09:04.103 --> 09:04.845
"SKlD."

09:04.939 --> 09:07.473
"Down I go again!
What's making me fall?"

09:07.567 --> 09:10.060
"Now's my chance to -
jump on his chest!"

09:10.154 --> 09:11.061
"THUD."

09:11.155 --> 09:13.357
"You won't catch me out this time,
you braggart!"

09:13.450 --> 09:15.693
"A sock in the midriff
will settle your game!"

09:15.786 --> 09:16.862
"SPLASH."

09:16.955 --> 09:19.323
"What's this on my face?
Why, it's grease!"

09:19.417 --> 09:22.703
"- Give me that tube back!
- That's how he kept making me slip!"

09:22.796 --> 09:25.551
"He was squirting
invisible grease under my feet!"

09:25.634 --> 09:28.670
"You dirty twister!
It's time somebody taught you a lesson!"

09:28.764 --> 09:31.214
"- Take that!
- CRASH!"

09:31.308 --> 09:34.636
"- Where did he end up?
- In the middle of next week, Uncle Dan!"

09:52.422 --> 09:55.123
- Evenin'.
- I told yer it wouldn't take me long.

09:55.217 --> 09:57.585
What did you do?
Throw 'em over the gates?

09:57.679 --> 10:03.134
- I know some short cuts ont' way back.
- I'll bet you do! Over other folk's property.

10:05.106 --> 10:08.726
How many times d'yer want
tellin' where to put that bag?

10:12.951 --> 10:15.401
- Time is it?
- Time you were at school.

10:15.495 --> 10:16.769
ls it that late?

10:16.873 --> 10:20.493
I wouldn't be your teacher
for all the coal in Barnsley.

10:23.048 --> 10:25.885
Oh, Mr Porter! Watch it, Mr Porter.

10:25.969 --> 10:29.338
Yer clumsy young bugger!
What yer tryin' to do? Kill me?

10:29.432 --> 10:31.507
I lost me balance.

10:33.229 --> 10:36.640
I wouldn't put it past yer, either.
I fair felt me heart go then.

10:36.734 --> 10:39.852
Just sit down here and
relax a couple o' minutes.

10:40.615 --> 10:42.815
Are yer all right now?

10:42.909 --> 10:46.028
- I'm bloody champion!
- I'll be off, then.

10:46.748 --> 10:49.241
And don't be late tonight.

10:52.506 --> 10:53.883
- Allot?
- Sir.

10:53.966 --> 10:55.426
- Bowser?
- Sir.

10:55.510 --> 10:57.002

10:57.096 --> 11:00.257
- Absent, sir.

11:00.351 --> 11:01.894
- Sir.

11:01.978 --> 11:03.678
- Sir.
- Fisher?

11:03.772 --> 11:06.056
German Bight.

11:08.904 --> 11:11.397
- Did you say something?
- I didn't mean to, sir.

11:11.491 --> 11:14.777
Stand up, lad. What did you say?

11:14.871 --> 11:18.657
- German Bight, sir.
- He's daft, sir.

11:18.751 --> 11:21.620
- ls this your ridiculous idea of a joke?
- No, sir.

11:21.714 --> 11:25.125
- What is the idea, then?
- When you said "Fisher", sir.

11:25.219 --> 11:27.754
- What about it?
- Fisher. German Bight.

11:27.848 --> 11:31.791
It's the shipping forecast, sir.
Fisher. German Bight. Cromarty.

11:31.895 --> 11:34.847
I like to hear it every night, sir.
I like t'names.

11:34.940 --> 11:39.854
So you thought you'd enlighten me and
the class with your idiotic information?

11:39.948 --> 11:42.785
- No, sir.
- Making a mess of my register.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.539
- lt just came out.
- And so did you, Casper.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.189
Just come out from under a stone.

11:53.133 --> 11:55.376
I said, quiet!

11:55.470 --> 11:58.880
ls anyone else absent
besides Bridges and Fisher?

11:58.974 --> 12:01.509
Any girls?

12:01.603 --> 12:04.764
Right. Now, then,
it's time you were off to assembly.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.529
One row at a time. This one, stand.

12:09.823 --> 12:12.108
Move forward.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.606
Pamela, you're talking. Cut it out.

12:21.882 --> 12:27.306
- Billy, what do yer mean, Germans bite?
- I'm sick of hearin' about "Germans bite"!

12:27.390 --> 12:29.757

12:29.851 --> 12:31.802

Don't be late.

12:33.815 --> 12:35.432

12:35.526 --> 12:37.518

12:37.612 --> 12:39.020

12:39.115 --> 12:43.026

- Can't. Takin' t'girlfriend to Sheffield.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.779
Excuses!

13:03.023 --> 13:05.516
What do you want
at this time in the morning?

13:05.610 --> 13:06.935
Get your Mac up.

13:07.029 --> 13:10.356
Hey, he's fast asleep.
I can't get him up at this time.

13:10.450 --> 13:13.444
- Just get him up for me.
- His father, he'll be down to yer.

13:13.538 --> 13:17.157
I'm not bothered about his father.
I want your MacDowall.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.641
- Bugger off, you little sod!
- Get him up, will yer?

13:27.725 --> 13:30.885
- I'm not gettin' him up.
- He said I had to get him up.

13:30.979 --> 13:34.598
He's fast asleep and he's not goin',
so just get off with yer.

17:15.545 --> 17:18.622
- Now, then. What's tha doin'?
- Nowt.

17:18.715 --> 17:21.083
Bugger off, then. It's private property.

17:21.178 --> 17:24.171
- Can I get up to that kestrel's nest?
- What kestrel's nest?

17:24.265 --> 17:27.050
- Up wall.
- No nest up there, so off tha goes.

17:27.144 --> 17:29.638
There is. I've seen 'em come out.

17:33.070 --> 17:35.521
What will tha do? Take all its eggs?

17:35.614 --> 17:38.900
- They're young 'uns.
- Nowt to go up for, then, is there?

17:38.994 --> 17:42.739
Can I come to t'bottom, then?
Never seen a kestrel's nest before.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.908
Come on, then.

17:51.762 --> 17:53.963
There it is. That big hole.

17:54.057 --> 17:57.469
- It's nested there for donkey's years now.
- And I never knew.

17:57.562 --> 18:01.975
- No, there's not many that does.
- Been watchin' from t'wood there.

18:02.069 --> 18:04.738
Goes onto t'post, then hovers,

18:04.823 --> 18:09.777
then swoops down onto t'prey,
carries it off to t'young 'uns. Looks great.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.239
I've been gonna knock
that wall down for ages.

18:12.332 --> 18:16.036
- What for?
- It's dangerous. I won't let her play near.

18:16.129 --> 18:19.374
- lf I lived round here, l'd train a young 'un.
- Would yer?

18:19.468 --> 18:21.669
Yer can train 'em.

18:21.763 --> 18:23.838
Do yer know how?

18:24.474 --> 18:28.261
- Do you know?
- No. There's not many that does.

18:28.355 --> 18:31.766
They're hard to train.
lf they're not kept properly, it's criminal.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.645
- Do yer know anybody who's kept 'em?
- One or two.

18:34.739 --> 18:39.193
But, er, they had to let 'em go
because they're hard to train.

18:39.287 --> 18:42.365
Where can I find out about 'em, then?

18:42.459 --> 18:46.871
Well, probably t'public library.
They'll have some books on 'em.

18:46.965 --> 18:48.749
- Where's that?
- Down int' city.

18:49.093 --> 18:51.419
Hey, are you a member?

18:51.513 --> 18:54.079
- What do yer mean?
- Are you a member of the library?

18:54.183 --> 18:57.052
I don't know about that.
I only want a book on falconry.

18:57.146 --> 18:59.764
You have to be a member
to take a book out.

18:59.858 --> 19:03.477
- I only want one.
- Have you filled one of these forms in?

19:08.161 --> 19:09.945
- No.
- You're not a member, then.

19:10.039 --> 19:13.158
You'll have to take one of these home
for your father to sign.

19:13.252 --> 19:16.788
- Me dad's away.
- You can wait till he comes back home.

19:16.882 --> 19:21.503
- I don't mean that. I mean he's left home.
- I see. Your mother'll have to sign it.

19:21.597 --> 19:25.008
Ar, but she's at work
and she'll not be home till tea time.

19:25.102 --> 19:27.011
There's no rush, is there?

19:27.104 --> 19:29.598
I've never broke a book.
I haven't tore it, or...

19:29.692 --> 19:33.562
Look at your hands. They're filthy.
We'll end up with dirty books that way.

19:33.656 --> 19:38.527
- I don't ready dirty books.
- I hope you don't. You're not old enough.

19:38.954 --> 19:42.324
Me mam knows someone who
works here. That'll help, won't it?

19:42.418 --> 19:45.495
No, not at all.
You still have to have the back signed.

19:45.589 --> 19:48.792
To be a member, you'll have
to have somebody over 21

19:48.886 --> 19:51.639
who is on the borough
electoral roll to sign it.

19:51.722 --> 19:54.216
- I'm over 21 .
- You're not over 21 .

19:54.310 --> 19:57.220
- Ar, but I vote.
- You don't vote. You're not...

19:57.314 --> 20:00.068
I vote for me mam.
She dun't like votin', so I do it.

20:00.360 --> 20:04.981
- Just have to wait for it, won't you?
- Where would I find a book? In a shop?

20:05.075 --> 20:08.862
You'd have to go down the street.
There's a second-hand bookshop there.

20:36.995 --> 20:39.989
- Hello. Can I help you?
- Yes.

20:40.083 --> 20:46.164
I'm rather interested in Noël Coward's
autobiography, Present lndicative.

21:26.481 --> 21:29.683
- What's tha got this for? Tha can't read.
- Give us it here.

21:29.777 --> 21:32.938
Get off! Falconry?
What's tha want to know about falconry?

21:33.032 --> 21:35.024
Give it here!

21:35.118 --> 21:37.444
- Where've yer got this from?
- I've lent it.

21:37.538 --> 21:40.407
Stole it, more like.
Where've yer got it from?

21:40.501 --> 21:42.576
A shop in town.

21:44.340 --> 21:49.544
You must be crackers. I could understand
if it were money, but chuff me, not a book!

21:51.516 --> 21:52.924
Have it!

21:53.018 --> 21:55.720
Look what yer've done.
I'm lookin' after this book.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.945
- And what better off will yer be?
- A lot. I'm gonna get a kestrel and train it.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.594
Train it? Yer couldn't train a flea.

22:03.658 --> 22:05.942
Anyway, where yer gonna get
a kestrel from?

22:06.036 --> 22:07.946
- I know a nest.
- Yer don't.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.157
- All right, then, I don't.
- Where?

22:10.250 --> 22:12.160
- I'm not tellin'.
- I said, where?

22:12.254 --> 22:15.248
- You're hurtin' me arm!
- Where, then?

22:15.342 --> 22:17.417
Monastery Farm.

22:19.848 --> 22:22.132
Yer could have broke me arm then.

22:22.226 --> 22:25.063
I'll have to see about
goin' round there wi' me gun.

22:25.147 --> 22:28.433
- I'll tell t'farmer on yer.
- Why? What's he got to do with it?

22:28.527 --> 22:31.093
- He protects 'em.
- Protects 'em?

22:31.197 --> 22:34.607
Hawks are a menace to farmers.
They eat all the poultry an' that.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.987
Ar, I know. They dive down
onto t'cows and take 'em away.

22:38.081 --> 22:42.535
- Funny bugger.
- Well, yer talk daft. They're only small.

22:42.629 --> 22:45.999
They eat mice, insects,
and little birds sometimes.

22:46.426 --> 22:51.632
Hope I'll be watchin' a bird tonight. She'll
not have feathers. Not all over, anyway.

22:59.821 --> 23:02.689
- Have you had any tea yet, Billy?
- No.

23:02.783 --> 23:05.902
Well, get some, then.
You where t'pantry is.

23:07.164 --> 23:10.491
- How's yer horses gone on, Jud?
- Not bad. Two winners.

23:10.585 --> 23:13.371
You haven't.
Might be gettin' tret tonight, then.

23:13.464 --> 23:16.750
- Oh, somebody treats you every night.
- Shut it!

23:16.844 --> 23:19.838
And don't you be comin' home
blind drunk again, Jud.

23:19.932 --> 23:23.594
- Why? Are yer entertainin'?
- You're kiddin'.

23:23.688 --> 23:27.182
lf I entertained as much as you,
I shall do all right, shan't I?

23:27.276 --> 23:30.896
What tripe you've been
goin' out with lately. My God!

23:32.658 --> 23:37.237
- Better'n that cripple you bring home.
- What cripple? Reg? He's not a cripple.

23:37.331 --> 23:42.244
Will be if he comes in here tonight. At
least them I go out with are not tightfisted.

23:42.338 --> 23:47.252
Who is? You chuck your bloody money
around like a Scotchman with no arms!

23:47.346 --> 23:50.757
Have to use a spanner to get
a threepenny bit out of his hand.

23:50.851 --> 23:52.843
Aye, because he's comin' wise to you.

23:52.937 --> 23:57.516
Listen, what about him you're goin' wi'?
Tight as a camel's arse in a sandstorm.

23:57.610 --> 24:01.521
Keep yer hand over yer mouth talkin'
about him, cos yer'll get into trouble.

24:01.615 --> 24:04.182
- You're not too big for a hidin'.
- He can't do it.

24:04.286 --> 24:07.989
Who can't? You might find that
he's bigger than what you think.

24:08.083 --> 24:10.200
More chance of gettin' struck by lightnin'.

24:10.295 --> 24:15.041
Shut yer face. I'm fed up of it. It's every
Saturday night. I get ready, you're at me.

24:15.135 --> 24:18.296
And I always go out in
a bloomin' mess and all upset.

24:18.932 --> 24:22.008
Gettin' too big for yer boots,
thinking you own t'house.

24:22.102 --> 24:24.262
You don't own it yet, yer know.

24:24.356 --> 24:27.934
- No. I will do one day, though, won't I?
- Over my dead body.

24:28.028 --> 24:32.524
- That's what I says, I'll own it one day.
- I'm sick on it, Jud. I am, pig sick.

24:32.617 --> 24:36.560
I work every day, and every Saturday
night I go for a drink and you upset me.

24:36.665 --> 24:39.867
- I don't think I'll go, I'm that fed up.
- I'll not miss yer.

24:39.961 --> 24:42.580
You'll not miss nowt, will you?
You'll be out there.

24:42.674 --> 24:44.749
- Yeah.
- Aye.

24:48.390 --> 24:53.626
By, what a smart-lookin' kid int' mirror.
Some bird's gonna be lucky tonight.

24:53.730 --> 24:56.641
Listen to God's gift to woman.

24:56.735 --> 24:59.103
Fancy buying me
a brandy and pep tonight?

24:59.197 --> 25:01.689
Aye. Hope it keeps fine for yer.

25:08.293 --> 25:12.236
These could have done
with a bit of a polish.

25:12.340 --> 25:15.011
Still, never mind, it's gonna be dark soon.

25:16.137 --> 25:18.922
What you gonna do
with yerself tonight, love?

25:19.016 --> 25:21.133
Read me book.

25:21.227 --> 25:24.722
Oh, look at t'time. Five to seven.
I'm gonna be late again.

25:24.816 --> 25:27.768
Listen, Billy, there's two bob here. Chuck?

25:27.862 --> 25:30.856
Get yerself some pop
and some crisps. D'yer hear?

25:30.950 --> 25:32.817
Yeah.

25:35.623 --> 25:38.533
- And don't still be up when I come in.
- No.

25:39.670 --> 25:41.746
G'night, then.

25:53.272 --> 25:55.557
I came home unexpectedly

25:55.651 --> 25:58.645
And caught her crying needlessly

25:58.739 --> 26:01.064
In the middle of the day

26:02.828 --> 26:07.491
And it was in the early spring
when flowers bloom and robins sing

26:07.584 --> 26:09.661
She went away

26:11.298 --> 26:14.584
And honey, I miss you

26:16.013 --> 26:19.299
And I'm bein' good

26:20.769 --> 26:24.055
And l'd love to be with you

26:25.652 --> 26:30.565
lf only I could

26:35.624 --> 26:37.492
Folks, thank you.

26:39.379 --> 26:41.414
Now a Tremeloes number.

26:41.508 --> 26:44.000
Yer can have a good time up to a point,

26:44.094 --> 26:46.931
but there comes a time
when you want to settle down.

26:47.015 --> 26:49.884
I'm gettin' a bit fed up
of workin' all t'time.

26:49.978 --> 26:53.556
There's plenty of time
to settle down, in't there?

26:53.650 --> 26:56.351
Depends what yer lookin' for, dun't it?

26:58.490 --> 27:03.110
I just like to come home, get me meal,
get a bath, change and out, me.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.278
Not a care int' world.

27:04.372 --> 27:07.283
When you've been married once
and yer marry a wrong 'un,

27:07.377 --> 27:10.913
it makes yer a bit apprehensive
towards gettin'...

27:11.007 --> 27:14.210
Well, you know, don't yer?
Cos he were never good.

27:14.303 --> 27:18.007
But it makes yer a bit more wary
about gettin' married again.

27:18.100 --> 27:21.095
lf she wants to go with a different bloke,
it's not up to me.

27:21.188 --> 27:23.723
She's old enough to know her own mind.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.768
- Well, yeah...
- ..settle down.

27:25.861 --> 27:30.076
You can never tell with Billy. I sit
and wonder sometimes what he will do.

27:30.159 --> 27:34.290
Perhaps if he had been brought up
in a different environment

27:34.373 --> 27:37.993
and had a better education, he would
have made more than what he has.

27:38.087 --> 27:41.999
At the moment, he's hopeless.
He's a hopeless case, in't he?

27:42.093 --> 27:44.418
Oh, won't you please come back?

27:45.639 --> 27:47.965
Oh, won't you please come back?

27:53.859 --> 27:56.978
I'm happy as I am.
I doubt if I could be any happier.

27:57.072 --> 28:00.607
My lads have got nowt.
I don't know what they're gonna do.

28:00.702 --> 28:03.487
I don't know whether
our Jud wanted to be a miner.

28:07.795 --> 28:11.873
From my point of view, Reg, when
a woman gets to my age, you've two kids,

28:11.967 --> 28:15.337
you want to be settlin' down
wi' a nice house

28:15.431 --> 28:21.221
and somebody to come home to yer,
and be lookin' after 'em.

28:21.314 --> 28:25.226
- Like I look after you.
- Ar, but you're not married to me.

28:25.320 --> 28:28.564
- Never mind. Giz a kiss.
- Don't be so damned daft!

28:28.658 --> 28:31.224
- He's had too much ale again.
- I haven't.

28:31.328 --> 28:32.789
- Yer have.
- I haven't.

28:32.872 --> 28:35.740
Say, Mam, have you brought
that cripple wi' yer?

28:35.834 --> 28:38.870
Keep it shut. Keep it shut.

28:38.964 --> 28:40.665
Keep it shut, all right?

28:40.800 --> 28:44.336
Say, did everybody hear
about him when he got married?

28:44.430 --> 28:48.374
He got confetti on elastic.
That's how tightfisted he is.

28:50.146 --> 28:52.390
lf he wants trouble, I'll give him trouble.

28:52.483 --> 28:56.353
Oh, along the road there lives
a guy l'd like you all to know

28:57.532 --> 29:00.901
He grew a great big marrow
for the little flower show

29:01.496 --> 29:05.116
He showed it to a lady
who lived just along the way

29:05.752 --> 29:10.957
And when she saw the size of it
he heard the lady say

29:14.806 --> 29:16.674
Ooohhh!

29:17.977 --> 29:19.927
What a beauty!

29:20.021 --> 29:23.391
Oh, I've never seen one
as big as that before

29:24.362 --> 29:25.905
Ooohhh!

29:25.988 --> 29:27.855
What a whopper!

29:27.949 --> 29:30.443
lt must be 18 inches long or more

29:31.788 --> 29:35.324
It's such a lovely colour,
it's nice and round and fat

29:35.585 --> 29:38.913
Whoever thought a marrow
could grow as big as that?

29:39.716 --> 29:41.792
Ooohhh!

29:42.804 --> 29:45.172
Oh, what a beauty

29:45.266 --> 29:48.103
I've never seen one as big as it before

30:26.740 --> 30:28.817
Billy, are tha asleep?

30:55.447 --> 30:57.732
Bleedin' things.

31:01.957 --> 31:04.325
Now, Billy!

31:04.419 --> 31:06.577
- Give over.
- Billy!

31:06.671 --> 31:09.342
Help me get these bleedin' trousers off.

31:14.516 --> 31:17.082
Come on! Don't be all bleedin' night.

31:21.734 --> 31:24.228
I'm fed up with this bloody game.

31:26.533 --> 31:29.026
It's every Saturday night alike.

31:30.330 --> 31:32.823
Don't help, will tha?

31:49.440 --> 31:52.893
Get back to sleep, yer... pig.

31:53.571 --> 31:55.564
Hog. Sow.

31:55.658 --> 31:58.067
Yer drunken bastard.

31:58.160 --> 32:02.030
Tha dun't like bein' called a bastard,
does tha? Yer bastard!

32:02.124 --> 32:04.201
Yer pig.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.080
Pig.

32:07.174 --> 32:08.498
Hog.

32:08.592 --> 32:09.833
Sow.

32:09.927 --> 32:12.420
Drunken... bastard.

32:12.723 --> 32:15.050
Bastard. Bastard.

32:15.143 --> 32:16.760
Drunken... pig.

32:17.187 --> 32:19.681
Pig.

32:23.864 --> 32:26.273
Billy! Billy!

35:13.728 --> 35:16.804
"Three good meals a day
I'll give him for about a fortnight."

35:16.898 --> 35:20.601
"lf a piece of meat held between
the finger and thumb of the gloved hand

35:20.695 --> 35:26.151
is offered to the hawk, it will probably
bend down and pull at it with its beak."

35:55.536 --> 35:56.861
C'mon.

36:20.029 --> 36:23.190
"As soon as the hawk
will come a leash length indoors,

36:23.283 --> 36:27.227
she may be tried off a fence
or gatepost out of doors."

36:27.331 --> 36:32.327
"lt is quite likely that although she was
coming to the fist promptly indoors,

36:32.421 --> 36:34.664
she will now refuse to come at all."

36:34.758 --> 36:39.963
"She will stand looking around her and
ignoring the meat and fist in front of her."

37:03.006 --> 37:05.124
"When she will come
a leash length outside,

37:05.218 --> 37:09.672
she can be called greater distances
by means of a creance,

37:09.766 --> 37:13.219
a long cord which is attached
to the hawk to prevent her escaping."

37:13.313 --> 37:16.431
"With luck,
she will not attempt to fly away."

37:34.759 --> 37:36.835
Come on, then.

37:41.477 --> 37:44.230
Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

37:44.314 --> 37:46.473
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, lass.

37:46.567 --> 37:48.852
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

37:50.490 --> 37:53.160
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

37:53.494 --> 37:56.613
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

37:57.792 --> 38:00.357
Come on, then. Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

38:01.881 --> 38:04.206
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, Kes.

38:15.942 --> 38:18.435
(theme from "Grandstand")

38:46.443 --> 38:49.771
Come on, boys, get ready!

38:49.865 --> 38:51.940
Get ready now, you.

38:52.869 --> 38:55.153
Skiving again, Guthrie.

38:55.247 --> 38:58.032
No, sir. Mr Farthing
has been talking to me.

38:58.126 --> 39:01.287
I'll bet that was stimulating
for him, wasn't it, lad?

39:01.381 --> 39:05.209
- What does that mean, sir?
- The conversation. What do you think?

39:05.303 --> 39:07.253
Does it mean "stimulate", sir?

39:07.347 --> 39:12.887
Stimulating, you fool!
S-t-i-m-i-l-a-t-i-n-g. Stimulating.

39:14.858 --> 39:17.696
Come on, get ready.
You're two weeks late already.

39:20.617 --> 39:24.236
You three, get down,
before I come and put yer down.

39:26.833 --> 39:31.047
Casper, what d'you think you're doing?
Get down. Why aren't you changed?

39:31.131 --> 39:35.293
- I've no kit, sir.
- Casper, you make me sick.

39:35.387 --> 39:39.330
Every lesson it's the same old story,
"Please, sir, I've no kit, sir."

39:39.434 --> 39:45.683
Every lesson for four years, you've
begged, borrowed, skived and scrounged.

39:45.777 --> 39:49.313
Why is it, Casper, when all this lot
can provide kit, you can't?

39:49.407 --> 39:52.401
Don't know. Me mam says
it's a waste of money now I'm leavin'.

39:52.495 --> 39:55.279
You haven't been leaving
the past four years, have you?

39:55.373 --> 39:56.573
No, sir.

39:56.667 --> 39:59.618
- Use your spending money.
- Don't like football, sir.

39:59.713 --> 40:03.040
- What's that got to do with it, Casper?
- Don't know.

40:03.134 --> 40:06.962
- Anyway, I don't get enough.
- Get a job, then, lad. Get a job.

40:07.056 --> 40:09.758
- I've got one, sir.
- They pay you, don't they?

40:09.852 --> 40:13.347
Yeah, but I have to give it to me mam.
I'm payin' me fines, like...

40:13.441 --> 40:17.384
You should keep out of trouble, lad!
Keep out of trouble.

40:17.488 --> 40:22.150
- I haven't bin in trouble since last time.
- I'll get you some kit, Casper.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.791
- Tha's had it now, Casper.
- Shut thi mouth!

40:27.043 --> 40:29.536
Right, Casper. Get into those.

40:32.843 --> 40:35.681
- They'll not fit me.
- You can get into them, can't you?

40:35.764 --> 40:37.307
Yes, sir.

40:37.391 --> 40:40.228
They'll keep your cobblers warm, Casper.

40:41.980 --> 40:45.600
- Take your vest and underpants off.
- Don't wear 'em, sir.

40:47.405 --> 40:51.348
Casper, tuck 'em in.
Thi privates are showin'.

40:51.453 --> 40:53.403
The muscleman o' t'year!

40:55.500 --> 40:59.370
- He's just come back from Biafra.
- Pull them up, Casper!

40:59.464 --> 41:02.499
- Pull them up!
- Like that, sir?

41:02.593 --> 41:05.430
Pull them down, Casper.

41:05.514 --> 41:07.757
You're too daft to laugh at.

41:07.851 --> 41:10.135
Right. They'll do there.

41:10.228 --> 41:14.766
You lot, come on, get changed.
Wasted enough time already.

41:14.860 --> 41:17.562
I'll give you a sample
of my footballing skills.

41:17.656 --> 41:20.858
A rare delight.

41:24.833 --> 41:27.326
Watch yourself, Casper!

41:28.880 --> 41:31.373
I won't tell you again, Crossland!

41:32.010 --> 41:34.085
Come on, move.

41:34.888 --> 41:37.214
Off that goal post!

41:37.308 --> 41:40.594
Off that goal post.
I'll be up there in a minute!

41:40.688 --> 41:44.736
Come here, Tibbut.
We'll pick two teams. You're the captain.

41:44.819 --> 41:47.813
Right, line up on the halfway line, quickly.

41:47.907 --> 41:51.694
- I'll have first pick. Paget.
- That's not fair. You'll get t'best players.

41:51.787 --> 41:54.739
D'you wanna play football,
or d'you wanna do some maths?

41:54.833 --> 41:56.825
Paget, then. Come here.

41:56.919 --> 41:58.327
- Speed.
- Walker.

41:58.421 --> 41:59.799
- Clark.
- Crossland.

41:59.882 --> 42:02.083
- Kelsey.
- Rowe.

42:03.429 --> 42:05.713
Er... Clegg.

42:07.017 --> 42:09.134
Bloody hell, I'm frozen already.

42:09.228 --> 42:11.346
- Joyce.
- Birkinshaw.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.766
- Ryder.
- Parker.

42:13.860 --> 42:16.426
- Norton.
- Come on, Parker.

42:17.323 --> 42:19.941
Casper, I've got to have yer. Come on.

42:20.035 --> 42:22.821
Don't act the goat.
Come on, put 'em round your waist.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.781
Now.

42:28.839 --> 42:32.782
Right, we'll play with the wind,
downhill, this way.

42:32.886 --> 42:35.453
Paget, you're inside right. Come on.

42:42.107 --> 42:46.353
- Who are you today, sir? Liverpool?
- Don't you know your club colours?

42:46.447 --> 42:50.067
- Manchester United, this.
- Are you playing Denis Law, striker?

42:50.160 --> 42:54.375
No. Charlton today, lad.
All over the field. Too cold for striker.

42:54.458 --> 42:57.025
Charlton's not as quick
ont' turn as Law, is he?

42:57.129 --> 42:59.497
- You tryin' to tell me about football?
- No. l...

42:59.591 --> 43:03.753
You trying to tell me? Anyway,
Denis Law's in the wash this week.

43:08.270 --> 43:11.389
- Nobody's in goal, sir.
- No goalie, sir.

43:11.483 --> 43:13.516
- Who's in the goals?
- Casper.

43:13.610 --> 43:17.658
- Casper, what position are you playing?
- Don't know, sir. lnside left?

43:17.741 --> 43:20.777
How can you be inside left
back there, idiot? In the goals.

43:20.871 --> 43:24.949
- I can't...
- Now's your chance to learn. In the goals.

43:25.043 --> 43:27.370
Quick about it.

43:27.464 --> 43:32.210
- We're Manchester United. Who are you?
- Spurs, then there's no clash of colours.

43:32.303 --> 43:38.260
Right, then, it's Manchester United versus
Spurs in this cup tie here at Old Trafford.

43:38.354 --> 43:41.973
And it's the fair-haired,
slightly balding Charlton to kick off.

43:54.835 --> 43:58.330
Come on, Speed.
What you playin' at, lad?

43:58.424 --> 44:01.626
Yer should be on the move, lad.
lt was at yer feet!

44:01.719 --> 44:04.046
Cross it, Ryder. Quickly.

44:04.140 --> 44:06.633
Where's t'rest of my team?

44:13.653 --> 44:17.231
Come on, quickly, Casper. I've never
seen such slack work in my life.

44:21.414 --> 44:24.251
- What's that for, sir?
- Slack work, lad. Slack work.

44:24.335 --> 44:26.901
Hit that ball up the field, Parker.

44:29.425 --> 44:31.668
I have to keep this shirt on after.

44:31.762 --> 44:33.545
Cross the ball!

44:33.639 --> 44:36.049
And Charlton goes through, and...

44:36.143 --> 44:38.637
Oh, never! Never!

44:41.066 --> 44:42.809
- Penalty!
- Never.

44:42.903 --> 44:45.468
Who do you think you are? Bremner?

44:47.743 --> 44:50.445
- Penalty.
- No, it weren't, sir!

44:50.539 --> 44:52.614
Outside that semicircle.

44:56.213 --> 44:59.833
- Shall I take it, sir?
- I take the penalties on this team.

45:03.932 --> 45:06.499
No one moves till this ball's kicked.

45:10.442 --> 45:13.278
Just watch this, Guthrie. Right, Clegg?

45:16.909 --> 45:20.278
You moved. You moved. Put it back.

45:27.716 --> 45:29.583
Penalty.

45:30.887 --> 45:33.380
Behind the 18-yard line.

45:34.851 --> 45:37.970
Tha better save it, Cleggy!
Else I'll drop tha.

45:40.984 --> 45:43.550
- He moved!
- I didn't move, sir.

45:43.655 --> 45:46.148
The referee's decision is final.

46:02.139 --> 46:07.344
- You should have done it the first time.
- And that, boys, is how to take a penalty.

46:08.106 --> 46:10.599
Look one way and kick the other.

46:11.986 --> 46:13.687
Come on, Tibbut, lad.

46:13.781 --> 46:17.401
And Bobby Charlton has
equalised for Manchester United,

46:17.494 --> 46:19.486
and the score is one goal each.

46:25.339 --> 46:29.918
That fat twat!
He wants bleedin' milkin'. That big fat git!

46:30.930 --> 46:33.965
What did you say? What did you say?

46:34.059 --> 46:37.345
- Nowt, sir.
- Get off! In that changin' room! Get off!

46:37.439 --> 46:40.005
- I didn't say nowt, sir.
- Off!

46:40.944 --> 46:45.565
- I won't tolerate that on a football pitch.
- That's our captain, sir.

46:45.659 --> 46:49.279
I don't care who he is.
You play this game like gentlemen.

46:50.707 --> 46:52.783
Right inside!

46:55.297 --> 46:57.791
An early bath for you, lad.

47:00.471 --> 47:03.965
- I'll bounce the ball up.
- It's not fair! They never get sent off!

47:04.059 --> 47:08.890
- I shall be up there in a minute!
- They never get sent off, sir.

47:10.277 --> 47:12.352
Off!

47:20.708 --> 47:23.201
What d'you think you two are doing?

47:25.840 --> 47:28.333
- What are you doing?
- Practising, sir.

47:29.053 --> 47:31.546
Show me what you're doing.

47:59.304 --> 48:01.380
Casper!

48:02.892 --> 48:06.804
Casper, what do you think you are, lad?
An ape?

48:06.898 --> 48:10.267
- All he needs now is a banana.
- Get down. I'll make you red hot.

48:16.328 --> 48:18.946
Thank you. Now, for my next trick...

48:19.040 --> 48:22.983
I'll show you a trick! Get back in that goal!

48:29.263 --> 48:33.008
- What's up?
- That hurt. That ball, it's hard as iron.

48:33.102 --> 48:35.594
Ar, I know. It's like a stone, innit?

48:36.482 --> 48:40.226
- I'm bloody freezin'.
- My feet are like blocks o' ice.

48:40.362 --> 48:43.313
Me knees, look at 'em. They're goin' pale.

48:43.407 --> 48:45.974
Look at t'colour. It's gone white.

48:46.579 --> 48:48.738
Oh, I wish l'd brought a note.

49:09.069 --> 49:12.480
- Great goal, that, sir.
- I'll give yer "great goal", lad.

49:12.574 --> 49:17.153
- Spurs into the sixth round of t'Cup.
- Sixth round? I'll give you six of the best.

49:17.247 --> 49:19.949
- Lost again, sir?
- Fetch my tracksuit.

49:20.043 --> 49:23.161
- Better luck next time.
- Disgusting!

49:32.143 --> 49:34.709
- In a hurry, Casper?
- I have to get home, sir.

49:34.813 --> 49:36.847
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

49:36.941 --> 49:39.058
- Forgotten something?
- No, sir.

49:39.152 --> 49:41.229
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

49:42.532 --> 49:45.099
- What about the showers?
- I've had one, sir.

49:47.707 --> 49:50.700
- You can ask any of 'em, sir.
- I'll just do that.

49:51.879 --> 49:54.247
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- No, sir.

49:54.340 --> 49:56.292
- Have you?
- No, sir.

49:56.385 --> 49:58.461
- Have you?
- No, sir.

50:01.309 --> 50:03.677
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- Who, sir?

50:03.771 --> 50:06.180
- Casper.
- When, sir?

50:06.274 --> 50:09.476
- Just now. Has he had a shower?
- Had a shower, sir?

50:09.570 --> 50:11.522
Has Casper had a shower?

50:11.615 --> 50:14.650
What you fooling about at, lad?
Has Casper had a shower?

50:14.744 --> 50:18.364
- I don't think so, sir.
- Speed, you'll get what Casper just had.

50:19.375 --> 50:23.507
No one's seen you have a shower,
Casper. Cos you haven't had one.

50:23.716 --> 50:27.627
- Me mam says I ain't to have a shower.
- Come here. What's your mother say?

50:27.721 --> 50:30.839
I ain't to have a shower, sir.
I've got a cold.

50:30.933 --> 50:34.303
- Where's your note, then?
- Can I bring it this afternoon, sir?

50:34.397 --> 50:36.963
That's no good, lad. I want one now.

50:37.067 --> 50:40.395
Any boy wishing to be excused
physical education, or showers,

50:40.489 --> 50:44.943
must, at the time of the lesson,
produce a sealed letter of explanation

50:45.037 --> 50:47.948
signed by one of his parents
or his legal guardian.

50:48.041 --> 50:50.826
- Go on, sir, let me go home.
- You can go, lad.

50:50.920 --> 50:53.486
Hey, come here.
When you've had a shower.

50:55.260 --> 50:57.794
- I haven't a towel, sir.
- Borrow one.

50:57.888 --> 51:01.508
- Nobody'll lend me one.
- Have a drip-dry, then. Shower, come on.

51:03.980 --> 51:05.972
- MacDowall.
- Sir?

51:06.066 --> 51:07.934
Come here, lad.

51:08.028 --> 51:11.522
Come here. What's this?

51:11.616 --> 51:13.692
Our dog did it, sir.

51:14.870 --> 51:16.654
- Your dog did it?
- Aye.

51:16.748 --> 51:19.450
lt bit me while I were fightin' it last night.

51:20.962 --> 51:23.529
A dog wearing nylons, lads.

51:31.686 --> 51:33.761
Bloody heck!

51:39.697 --> 51:41.773
- Still in a hurry?
- Can I go now, sir?

51:41.867 --> 51:44.402
- Have a proper wash.
- I've had one, sir.

51:44.496 --> 51:47.657
- In the shower, lad. In the shower.
- I've got to get home.

51:47.750 --> 51:49.826
ln the shower.

51:51.798 --> 51:54.467
Ryder, Speed, come here.

51:54.551 --> 51:57.117
Yes, you two. Come on.

51:57.222 --> 51:59.788
Stay here and see that
he doesn't come out.

51:59.892 --> 52:02.343
- Do what, sir?
- I said, stay there.

52:02.437 --> 52:04.930
See that he doesn't come out.

52:12.493 --> 52:15.612
Agh! Sir! It's gone cold!

52:16.457 --> 52:21.454
Got a sweat on, Casper? I thought you
might need a cooler after your exertions.

52:21.547 --> 52:27.254
It's not right, sir. I'll catch me death
of cold in here. It's not right.

52:27.348 --> 52:30.717
Was it right when you
let that goal in deliberately?

52:34.566 --> 52:37.267
- Can't we go for us dinners?
- No, you can stay there.

52:37.361 --> 52:40.981
- We're servers.
- I don't care. They can serve themselves.

52:43.329 --> 52:46.030
You shouldn't put me in goal.
You know I'm useless.

52:46.123 --> 52:48.617
Now's your chance to learn.

52:48.711 --> 52:52.372
Shall we let him out, sir?
He'll catch his death of cold.

52:52.466 --> 52:55.669
- He'll catch pneumonia.
- I don't care what he gets.

52:55.763 --> 52:58.673
lf he thinks I'm running
my blood to water for 90 minutes,

52:58.767 --> 53:03.346
for him to deliberately throw the game
away, he's got another think coming.

53:05.985 --> 53:08.103
Sir, we've got to go for us dinner.

53:15.248 --> 53:19.077
- Get down!
- He looks like a bleedin' snake!

53:19.171 --> 53:21.736
Think yourself lucky.

54:40.618 --> 54:42.819
- 'Ey up, Jud. How yer doin'?
- Rough, man.

54:42.913 --> 54:46.241
Why? You should be on top of the world
on a day like today.

54:46.335 --> 54:49.453
Another ten minutes
and I'll be at t'bottom of it.

56:03.651 --> 56:09.160
Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love

56:09.243 --> 56:15.408
Fit us for perfect rest above

56:15.877 --> 56:21.250
And help us this and every day

56:21.344 --> 56:29.553
To live more nearly as we pray

56:29.647 --> 56:35.436
Amen

56:41.163 --> 56:46.869
This morning's reading is taken from
Matthew, chapter 18, verses 10-1 4.

56:47.463 --> 56:50.457
"Never despise one of these little ones,
I tell you."

56:50.551 --> 56:52.794
"They have their guardian angels
in heaven

56:52.888 --> 56:56.465
who look continually
on the face of my heavenly father."

56:56.559 --> 57:00.220
"Suppose a man has a hundred sheep.
lf one of them strays,

57:00.314 --> 57:03.100
does he not leave
the other 99 on the hillside

57:03.194 --> 57:05.520
and go in search of the one that strayed?"

57:05.614 --> 57:08.650
"And if he should find it, I tell you this,

57:08.744 --> 57:13.239
he is more delighted over that sheep
than over the 99 that never strayed."

57:13.333 --> 57:16.170
"ln the same way,
it is not your heavenly father's will

57:16.253 --> 57:21.251
that one of these little ones should be
lost." Here ends this morning's reading.

57:26.476 --> 57:28.553
Stop! Stop that infernal coughing.

57:28.647 --> 57:34.352
Every morning alike. Clear your throats
on the way to school, not here.

57:34.446 --> 57:38.191
Sounds more like a dirt track
than an assembly hall.

57:42.332 --> 57:45.660
Come out! Come out, that boy!

57:45.754 --> 57:46.722
Who coughed? 

57:47.500 --> 57:49.822
Mr Hesketh, somewhere near you, I think.

57:50.260 --> 57:52.253
Fetch that boy out!

57:52.229 --> 57:54.595
MacDowall, it was you.
You were coughing.

57:54.689 --> 57:56.681
- lt weren't.
- Yes, it was. I heard you.

57:56.774 --> 57:58.557
- lt weren't, sir.
- Don't argue.

57:58.651 --> 58:01.487
- lt weren't me, honest.
- Headmaster's study.

58:01.571 --> 58:04.604
MacDowall! I might have known!
Get to my office!

58:04.698 --> 58:07.815
- lt weren't me, sir.
- And heaven help you.

58:10.621 --> 58:12.779
We will now say the Lord's Prayer.

58:13.373 --> 58:15.937
Hands together, eyes closed.

58:16.042 --> 58:17.658
Our Father...

58:17.752 --> 58:19.660
Our Father

58:19.753 --> 58:23.882
which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

58:25.050 --> 58:27.458
Thy kingdom come.

58:27.552 --> 58:29.711
Thy will be done...

58:37.395 --> 58:40.470
- Does he bite yer?
- He's had a little kid's hand off nearly.

58:40.564 --> 58:44.505
Has it? My, my, my!
What's it fastened on? A wire?

58:44.609 --> 58:48.227
Aye. It's broke this off an' all.
Just darted at t'kid and got him.

58:48.321 --> 58:52.147
Well, I don't know, I'm sure.
ls that what you've got t'glove on for?

58:52.241 --> 58:55.151
- Yeah. Just in case it gets me.
- Aye. Aye.

58:56.121 --> 58:57.903
- What d'yer call it?
- Kes.

58:57.997 --> 59:01.938
Kes? Aye. He is a nice bird.

59:05.587 --> 59:07.454
I shouldn't like to handle him.

59:07.548 --> 59:11.165
Casper! Casper! Up, lad! On yer feet!

59:12.010 --> 59:15.169
- You were asleep, weren't you, Casper?
- I don't know, sir.

59:15.263 --> 59:17.879
I know! You were. You were asleep.

59:17.973 --> 59:20.539
Why were you asleep,
you irreverent scoundrel?

59:20.643 --> 59:22.634
- Don't know, sir.
- I know why!

59:22.728 --> 59:26.220
You were roaming the streets at night
instead of being home in bed.

59:26.314 --> 59:31.517
See me in my office afterwards! I'll give
you something to sleep about! Sit!

59:33.696 --> 59:35.563
Here are the announcements.

59:35.656 --> 59:40.859
The youth employment officer will be
here today to meet the Easter leavers.

59:41.203 --> 59:43.278
Your parents should have been told.

59:43.372 --> 59:47.532
lf any boy has forgotten and thinks his
parents may wish to attend his interview,

59:47.626 --> 59:52.828
then he can consult the list on the main
notice board for the approximate times.

59:54.173 --> 59:59.000
And finally, for three members
of the smokers' union

59:59.094 --> 01:00:02.462
caught yesterday behind
the games storeroom,

01:00:02.555 --> 01:00:06.299
there will be a meeting
with me after assembly,

01:00:06.393 --> 01:00:10.719
when I will be pleased to see
and hear them pay their dues.

01:00:10.938 --> 01:00:13.973
He'd better not stick me.
I'm fetchin' me father up if he does.

01:00:14.067 --> 01:00:17.184
What yer bringin' yer father down for?
He don't do nowt.

01:00:17.278 --> 01:00:19.947
- How d'yer mean?
- Last time, he got stick an' all.

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.397
Shut up, will tha? I'm sick of hearin' yer.

01:00:22.491 --> 01:00:24.732
When he came,
they were laughin' at him.

01:00:24.826 --> 01:00:27.067
- Yer what?
- Yeah. Weren't they?

01:00:27.912 --> 01:00:30.478
Don't say that about my father, right?

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:35.742
He's not gonna beat me, anyhow.

01:00:35.836 --> 01:00:38.912
- What do you want?
- I've got a message for Mr Gryce.

01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:40.872
Better wait in the queue, then.

01:00:40.966 --> 01:00:44.625
He likes to keep yer waitin'.
He thinks it makes it worse.

01:00:44.719 --> 01:00:48.003
He can keep me till four o'clock.
I'm not bothered.

01:00:48.097 --> 01:00:50.798
l'd rather the cane than do lessons.

01:00:50.892 --> 01:00:53.175
Come here, you.

01:00:53.269 --> 01:00:56.177
Save us these till after
we come outta Gryce's.

01:00:56.271 --> 01:00:57.888
He'll think I'm a smoker.

01:00:57.981 --> 01:01:02.194
He'll not search you but he'll search us,
and if he finds 'em, we'll get two extra.

01:01:02.277 --> 01:01:04.727
- I don't want 'em.
- You want some fist instead?

01:01:04.821 --> 01:01:08.147
- You want to take them?
- You'd better, lad.

01:01:09.492 --> 01:01:12.776
OK. But if I get caned,
you give me something.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.779
Aye. Some fist if yer don't.

01:01:18.292 --> 01:01:20.960
'Ey up, he's here - Gryce Pudding.

01:01:21.503 --> 01:01:23.745
Single file.

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:25.830
Right. You lost, lad?

01:01:25.923 --> 01:01:29.041
- Please, sir, I'm going...
- On yer way, form room.

01:01:31.804 --> 01:01:34.588
You lot, inside.

01:01:38.268 --> 01:01:40.594
Same old faces.

01:01:40.771 --> 01:01:43.888
Same old faces.

01:01:44.608 --> 01:01:46.849
Ten years this school's been opened,

01:01:46.943 --> 01:01:51.895
and ten years have we seen, after
every assembly, a line of boys here,

01:01:51.989 --> 01:01:54.522
and the same old faces.

01:01:54.616 --> 01:01:58.776
- Sir, I've got a message...
- Shut up. Don't interrupt. Close the door.

01:02:00.998 --> 01:02:04.115
I've taught in this city for over 30 years.

01:02:04.292 --> 01:02:08.619
I taught some of your parents -
your father, MacDowall -

01:02:08.713 --> 01:02:11.121
in the old slum schools in the city,

01:02:11.215 --> 01:02:16.209
before they built this fine estate,
and this wonderful school.

01:02:17.221 --> 01:02:20.713
Things are no better now
than they were then.

01:02:20.807 --> 01:02:23.424
I just can't understand this generation.

01:02:23.518 --> 01:02:26.302
I thought I knew something
about young people.

01:02:26.396 --> 01:02:29.680
I should be able to,
you know, with my experience.

01:02:29.774 --> 01:02:31.932
But with you, no.

01:02:32.025 --> 01:02:36.603
lt just seems a complete
waste of money and a waste of time.

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:39.699
And it's a waste of time
talking to you now.

01:02:39.782 --> 01:02:42.108
- You're not listening, are you?
- Yes, sir.

01:02:42.202 --> 01:02:44.985
You're not! Crossland,
you're not listening, are you?

01:02:45.079 --> 01:02:47.113
- I am, sir.
- None of you are listening!

01:02:47.207 --> 01:02:49.771
Look at that glazed expression
on your faces.

01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:54.088
You never listen!
Yours is the generation that never listens!

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:56.735
Cos we can never tell you anything.

01:02:57.591 --> 01:03:00.499
You're the sophisticated ones,

01:03:00.593 --> 01:03:03.795
with all your music, and your gear.

01:03:03.889 --> 01:03:07.423
But, you know, it's superficial.
It's a sheen.

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:10.634
There's nothing solid
or worthwhile underneath.

01:03:10.728 --> 01:03:13.428
And why do I know this?

01:03:13.522 --> 01:03:17.849
Why do I know there's been
no advance in discipline or decency,

01:03:17.942 --> 01:03:20.143
or morals or manners?

01:03:20.237 --> 01:03:25.814
Why do I know it? Because I still
have to use this to you boys every day.

01:03:26.075 --> 01:03:30.777
Why? In the '20s and '30s,
I could understand it.

01:03:30.871 --> 01:03:32.654
They were hard times,

01:03:32.748 --> 01:03:36.283
but they produced qualities in people
that you lot will never have.

01:03:36.376 --> 01:03:39.243
I can be stopped in the street
by someone I taught then.

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:44.206
We'll talk about the old days, and we'll
laugh about the thrashings I gave him.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.865
But what do I get from you lot?

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.755
A honk from a greasy,
pimply-faced youth

01:03:52.182 --> 01:03:55.091
sitting at the wheel
of a big second-hand car.

01:03:55.977 --> 01:03:59.720
I don't know. I just don't know.

01:04:00.523 --> 01:04:05.518
No guts! No backbone!
Nothing to commend you whatsoever.

01:04:05.611 --> 01:04:08.520
Mere fodder for the mass media.

01:04:12.618 --> 01:04:16.861
And so, until someone
produces a better solution,

01:04:16.955 --> 01:04:19.446
I'll continue to use this cane,

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:24.451
knowing fully well that you'll be
back for it time and time and time again.

01:04:26.172 --> 01:04:30.113
You smokers will go out of here
with your hands ringing.

01:04:30.217 --> 01:04:34.544
Will it stop you smoking? You're already
looking forward to smoking at break.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:36.712
- What are you grinning about?
- Not grinnin'.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:40.257
You are! I'll bet you're already
thinking about smoking at break.

01:04:40.351 --> 01:04:42.259
Empty your pockets.

01:04:42.353 --> 01:04:46.972
I bet they're loaded with cigarettes.
Come on, all of you, empty your pockets.

01:04:49.693 --> 01:04:52.185
- Please, sir...
- Quiet. Empty your pockets.

01:04:52.278 --> 01:04:54.604
- You don't understand.
- Empty your pockets.

01:04:55.198 --> 01:04:57.064
Disgusting!

01:04:59.952 --> 01:05:01.902
Please, sir.

01:05:01.996 --> 01:05:04.404
You again? You again?!

01:05:04.498 --> 01:05:07.533
- Yes, sir.
- Empty your pockets.

01:05:07.626 --> 01:05:12.036
- But, sir, I've got a message from Mrs...
- Empty your pockets!

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:16.331
I don't believe it.

01:05:17.927 --> 01:05:20.169
I don't believe this.

01:05:22.264 --> 01:05:26.508
Empty your pockets, lad.
Empty your pockets when you're told!

01:05:26.602 --> 01:05:28.801
Come on, lad.

01:05:28.895 --> 01:05:30.762
Ah!

01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:36.100
A regular little cigarette factory,
aren't you?

01:05:36.194 --> 01:05:38.268
Yes, sir.

01:05:42.366 --> 01:05:44.858
Put that rubbish away!

01:06:07.222 --> 01:06:10.297
Now I hope it's going to be
a lesson to you.

01:06:10.391 --> 01:06:13.259
I don't suppose for one minute it will be.

01:06:13.353 --> 01:06:17.763
I don't doubt before the end of the week
you'll be back in here again

01:06:17.857 --> 01:06:20.422
for exactly the same crime, smoking.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:25.823
Perhaps, once in a while, it might sink in.

01:06:25.906 --> 01:06:29.107
- Yes, sir.
- That you're wasting your money,

01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:31.275
that it's your money you're burning,

01:06:31.369 --> 01:06:35.279
and it's your hands that get caned
when you come in here.

01:06:38.626 --> 01:06:41.952
Good morning. Entry of the gladiators.
Where have you been?

01:06:42.046 --> 01:06:44.287
- Been to see Mr Gryce, sir.
- For the stick?

01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:45.841
- Yes, sir.
- How many?

01:06:45.924 --> 01:06:47.999
- Two.
- Did it hurt?

01:06:48.092 --> 01:06:51.377
- Not bad.
- Right. Hope it didn't.

01:06:51.888 --> 01:06:53.963
Go on, sit down.

01:06:56.141 --> 01:06:58.175
Right now, fact.

01:06:58.269 --> 01:07:01.803
Anne, tell me what a fact is.

01:07:01.897 --> 01:07:03.846
Don't give me a fact.

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:08.809
You know, don't say that Guthrie's
got a tatty head or anything like that.

01:07:08.903 --> 01:07:12.980
A fact is something where
you find evidence out, like truth.

01:07:13.658 --> 01:07:16.691
Something that you know
has actually happened.

01:07:16.785 --> 01:07:19.903
This is a fact. All right?
Have you got that clear?

01:07:19.996 --> 01:07:22.750
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:26.034
Tibbut, sit up straight.

01:07:26.127 --> 01:07:29.119
And I want the rest of yer
to look at him - if you can bear it -

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:31.779
and tell me some facts about Tibbut.

01:07:32.175 --> 01:07:35.084
- Wolstenholme?
- He's always tryin' to go wi' t'lasses.

01:07:35.178 --> 01:07:37.961
ls he?

01:07:38.764 --> 01:07:41.255
- He smokes.
- Do I heck!

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.967
- Tha does.
- Get knotted, Guthrie!

01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:47.220
I'm not interested in what
he does out of school hours,

01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:51.474
as long as he doesn't come into
the class smokin' a fag. All right?

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:55.446
Come on, you people who aren't thinking.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.615
Right, Julie.

01:07:58.699 --> 01:08:03.902
I want you to think of an incident that's
happened to you sometime in the past,

01:08:03.995 --> 01:08:09.073
that is true, and that you think
will interest the rest of the class. All right?

01:08:09.417 --> 01:08:11.742
Well, er...

01:08:11.836 --> 01:08:15.120
I went to this all-night party yesterday.
And, er...

01:08:17.924 --> 01:08:21.792
about three o'clock,
we were dancin' int' garden -

01:08:23.138 --> 01:08:26.380
me and her and all the rest,
can't mention names -

01:08:26.474 --> 01:08:30.134
and, er, this woman
come across from t'road,

01:08:30.227 --> 01:08:32.428
and, er, she tells us to...

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.848
to make less noise,
or she'd fetch t'police.

01:08:36.942 --> 01:08:41.269
So, well... so we said,
let her fetch 'em if she wanted.

01:08:41.363 --> 01:08:43.926
So she fetched 'em.

01:08:46.368 --> 01:08:50.694
Things that have actually happened.
How about another one?

01:08:50.788 --> 01:08:52.946
What about you, Casper?

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.116
- Casper!
- What, sir?

01:08:56.209 --> 01:09:00.337
"What, sir?"
You'd know if you'd been listening.

01:09:00.421 --> 01:09:02.987
What have we just been talking about?

01:09:04.133 --> 01:09:06.886
- Stories, sir?
- What kind of stories?

01:09:10.348 --> 01:09:13.423
- You haven't been listening, have yer?
- Yes. Some of it.

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:15.591
Some of it?!

01:09:16.394 --> 01:09:18.470
Stand up!

01:09:23.068 --> 01:09:25.475
You're gonna tell us
a story about yourself.

01:09:25.569 --> 01:09:29.187
- I don't know any, sir.
- Well, you stand there till yer do.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.028
Always somebody, isn't there, eh?
Somebody who wants to be awkward.

01:09:37.122 --> 01:09:40.738
Just won't be interested,
doesn't matter what you do.

01:09:42.042 --> 01:09:44.535
Just like you, Casper.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.413
Come on.

01:09:50.384 --> 01:09:52.501
I'll give you two minutes

01:09:52.595 --> 01:09:56.536
to think of something, or the whole class
comes back at four o'clock.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.799
- Come on, don't stand there like a nail.
- He is a nail.

01:09:59.893 --> 01:10:01.133
Come on.

01:10:01.227 --> 01:10:05.888
- I say... tell him.
- Tell him about the hawk, Casper.

01:10:05.981 --> 01:10:09.683
lf anybody else calls out,
it'll be the last call they make!

01:10:10.444 --> 01:10:13.644
- Speed?
- He's got this hawk. He's mad over it.

01:10:13.738 --> 01:10:18.107
He just goes wi' t'hawk all t'time.
He's crackers over it.

01:10:18.201 --> 01:10:21.319
- Better than thee, anyroad.
- All right, Casper.

01:10:22.538 --> 01:10:24.613
Sit down.

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:30.420
Now, come on, tell us about this hawk.
Where'd you get it from?

01:10:30.504 --> 01:10:33.205
- I found it, sir.
- Where?

01:10:33.299 --> 01:10:36.134
- lnt' woods.
- Where d'you keep it?

01:10:36.218 --> 01:10:39.126
- In a shed.
- What do you feed it on?

01:10:40.054 --> 01:10:42.546
Beef. Mice. Birds.

01:10:43.224 --> 01:10:46.967
lsn't it cruel to keep it in a shed?
Wouldn't it be happier flying free?

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.553
I don't keep it int' shed all the time, sir.
I fly it every day.

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:54.890
- Doesn't it fly away?
- Course it don't fly away. I've trained it.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.894
Are you gonna tell us about it?
How do you train a hawk?

01:10:57.988 --> 01:11:00.938
You have to be right careful wi' 'em,
sir, right patient.

01:11:01.032 --> 01:11:03.315
You've got to feed 'em
when they're hungry.

01:11:03.409 --> 01:11:06.777
You can only do owt at feedin' time, sir.

01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:10.322
- Yeah?
- Got these jesses on, sir, all t'time.

01:11:10.416 --> 01:11:12.980
- These what?
- Jesses, sir.

01:11:13.085 --> 01:11:15.326
- How do you spell that?
- J-e...

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:19.330
All right. Come out here.
You'd better show us on the board.

01:11:19.424 --> 01:11:21.916
"Jesses". That's a new word to me.

01:11:22.635 --> 01:11:25.043
Hands up those who've
heard of jesses before?

01:11:25.137 --> 01:11:27.630
Nobody. Go on, write it up there.

01:11:33.019 --> 01:11:34.969
Right. Now tell us what it is.

01:11:35.063 --> 01:11:38.723
They're leather straps, sir.
And they attach to t'bird's feet.

01:11:38.817 --> 01:11:43.436
Say I've got t'bird on me hand. Straps
come down there. Then there's t'swivel.

01:11:43.529 --> 01:11:46.021
"Swivel". Write that on the board.

01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:55.029
- Then you've got your leash.
- "Leash". On the board.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.741
I fed it on me hand first.

01:11:58.835 --> 01:12:01.910
Then, when it got to know me,
I fed it on me glove.

01:12:02.505 --> 01:12:07.082
And after a while,
I put it two inches away from its claws.

01:12:07.176 --> 01:12:09.876
And, er... Like that, right?

01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:14.922
lt started to jump for t'meat. When it
started to jump, I could move me hand.

01:12:15.016 --> 01:12:18.759
- Hold your hand up, so we can see.
- I could move me hand away, like,

01:12:18.853 --> 01:12:23.430
to four inches and six inches. And when it
were doin' that, I started it wi' t'leash.

01:12:23.524 --> 01:12:27.309
Do they need water? When you've got
a budgie, you put water in the cage.

01:12:27.402 --> 01:12:30.353
Do they need water like that?

01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:35.107
Well, it, like, has a bath. lt has a bath
right early on int' morning, like.

01:12:36.369 --> 01:12:39.319
When do yer feed it?
How many times a day?

01:12:39.413 --> 01:12:42.113
To start off with,
three or four, to get it plump.

01:12:42.207 --> 01:12:44.449
- You make it sound very exciting.
- lt is.

01:12:44.543 --> 01:12:47.452
Most exciting thing was
when I flew her free first time.

01:12:47.546 --> 01:12:49.830
- Do you wanna hear about that?
- Yes, sir.

01:12:49.923 --> 01:12:51.873
Aye. Come on.

01:12:51.966 --> 01:12:56.293
Well, l'd been using t'creance
for about a week,

01:12:56.387 --> 01:12:59.056
and it had been goin' 30 or 40 yards.

01:12:59.139 --> 01:13:02.882
And it says when birds
are goin' 30-40 yards, it says int' book,

01:13:02.976 --> 01:13:05.542
it's time that it can start to fly free.

01:13:07.647 --> 01:13:10.484
Well, l'd been...

01:13:10.567 --> 01:13:15.769
l'd been wantin' to fly it free, but I daren't.
I were frightened it'd fly off or somethin'.

01:13:15.863 --> 01:13:18.189
This had been goin' on
for four or five days.

01:13:18.282 --> 01:13:22.151
And I keep on to missen,
sayin' that "Fly it free next day."

01:13:22.244 --> 01:13:27.406
Anyway, I got right mad wi' missen.
I says "Right, I'm flyin' it free tomorrow."

01:13:27.498 --> 01:13:29.991
Anyway, that night -
that Friday night it were -

01:13:30.085 --> 01:13:34.026
I didn't feed her up, so that
she'd be sharp set next mornin'.

01:13:34.297 --> 01:13:38.624
And I went to bed that night, Friday night,
and I didn't get an hour's sleep at all.

01:13:38.718 --> 01:13:43.420
I were frightened about t'bird,
that she'd fly off or summat like that.

01:13:43.514 --> 01:13:46.464
Anyway, when t'mornin' came,
I kept on sayin' to missen

01:13:46.558 --> 01:13:49.926
"lf she flies off, she flies off,
and it can't be helped."

01:13:50.019 --> 01:13:53.345
So I took t'swivel off
and let her hop onto t'post.

01:13:53.439 --> 01:13:57.975
There were nowt stoppin' her, she could
fly off. All that were on her were jesses.

01:13:58.068 --> 01:14:01.019
I thought "She must fly off.
She's forced to fly off."

01:14:01.113 --> 01:14:04.647
But she didn't.
She just stood there. I were terrified.

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:09.485
She was stood there, and I walked off
into t'field, and she were lookin' round,

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:14.031
and when I got about 70 yards from her,
in middle of t'field,

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:16.200
I called her.

01:14:17.002 --> 01:14:20.579
"Kes. Kes. Come on, Kes. Come on, then."

01:14:20.673 --> 01:14:23.999
Nowt happened. So I thought
"l'd better walk back and pick her up."

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:29.003
So while I were walkin' back,
I saw her flyin'. She came like a bomb!

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:33.507
About a yard off t'floor, like lightning,
head still, and you couldn't hear t'wings.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:37.011
There weren't a sound from t'wings.
And straight onto t'glove. Wham!

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:39.596
And she grabbed me for t'meat.

01:14:40.566 --> 01:14:43.433
I were pleased wi' missen,
and I didn't know what to do.

01:14:43.527 --> 01:14:47.520
So I thought I better do it again,
just to prove it weren't luck.

01:14:47.614 --> 01:14:50.178
So I took her back onto t'post,

01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:54.693
and walked up into t'middle of t'field,
and called her again.

01:14:54.787 --> 01:14:59.781
And she came just as good as first time,
straight onto t'glove, grabbin' for t'meat.

01:14:59.875 --> 01:15:03.951
Well, that were it, sir. l'd trained her, sir,
and that were all I could do.

01:15:04.045 --> 01:15:07.580
I think you've done enough.
Well done, Billy. Big hand of applause.

01:15:21.937 --> 01:15:23.803
- Got owt, Casper?
- Nay.

01:15:23.897 --> 01:15:28.766
Tha never has. Tha just cadges. Casper
the Cadger, they ought to call thee.

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:32.185
- I wouldn't give thee owt if I had.
- I'll give thee summat.

01:15:32.279 --> 01:15:34.772
What tha goin' for?
Don't tha like company?

01:15:34.866 --> 01:15:38.734
They say thi mother does. Tha's
got more uncles than any other kid.

01:15:38.827 --> 01:15:40.818
- Shut thi mouth!
- Make me.

01:15:40.912 --> 01:15:44.321
- Tha wouldn't say that to our Jud.
- Your Jud's nowt.

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:46.532
What? He's cock of t'estate.

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:50.244
- I know somebody who could do him.
- Who? Thi father?

01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:54.008
- He in't even thi brother.
- What is he? Me sister?

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.124
They don't even call him Casper.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:59.836
Course he's me brother!
We live int' same house, don't we?

01:16:01.514 --> 01:16:04.007
Get him! Get him!

01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:15.726
Fight!

01:16:44.596 --> 01:16:47.160
Right, you lot!
Ten seconds, out of my sight!

01:16:47.265 --> 01:16:49.632
One! Two! Three!

01:16:56.481 --> 01:16:59.046
Right, come here, you two. Come on.

01:17:00.777 --> 01:17:03.342
- What's goin' on?
- lt was him, sir. He started it.

01:17:03.446 --> 01:17:06.563
- He's been chuckin' coal.
- Ah, shut up. Shut up!

01:17:07.199 --> 01:17:11.484
It's always the same tale; somebody
else's fault, nobody's to blame.

01:17:11.578 --> 01:17:14.737
Look at the mess you're in!
Look at the state you've made!

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:18.074
- Casper, you're not dead yet.
- He will be when I've had him.

01:17:18.168 --> 01:17:24.246
Oh, yes! You're a big lad, aren't yer? He's
just about your size, Casper, isn't he? Eh?

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.457
Pick on somebody your own size.

01:17:26.551 --> 01:17:30.628
What if I rubbed your nose in the coke?
You'd say I was a bully, wouldn't yer?

01:17:30.721 --> 01:17:35.298
And you'd be right. Cos I'm bigger
and stronger than you, aren't I? Eh?

01:17:35.391 --> 01:17:38.061
- I'll fetch me dad.
- Oh, yes. And I'll fetch mine.

01:17:38.145 --> 01:17:40.594
My dad's heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:17:40.688 --> 01:17:43.181
so what will your dad do then, eh?

01:17:45.818 --> 01:17:50.479
That's what it's like to be bullied.
You don't like it, do yer?

01:17:50.573 --> 01:17:54.649
You'll like it a bit less if I ever catch
you at it again. Do you understand it?

01:17:54.743 --> 01:17:56.817
Yes, sir.

01:17:57.537 --> 01:18:01.030
Get it shovelled up. Come here a minute.
Have you been smoking?

01:18:01.123 --> 01:18:03.908
- No, sir.
- You have! I can smell it on your breath.

01:18:04.002 --> 01:18:07.119
- No, sir.
- See me afterwards. Get it done. Go on.

01:18:20.599 --> 01:18:21.924
What's it all about?

01:18:22.018 --> 01:18:26.345
He keeps callin' me names, and sayin'
things about me dad and me mam and...

01:18:26.438 --> 01:18:28.972
All right, all right, all right. Calm down.

01:18:29.357 --> 01:18:31.766
They all seem to pick on you. Why is it?

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.143
- Don't know.
- ls it because you're a bad 'un?

01:18:34.237 --> 01:18:37.146
Maybe I am sometimes,
but I'm not that bad, sir.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:42.234
I know stacks of other kids that's worse
than me, but they seem to get away wi' it.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.030
Why else do you think, eh?
There must be some reason.

01:18:47.124 --> 01:18:49.408
Well, take this mornin', sir.

01:18:49.501 --> 01:18:52.535
I came in and just dozed off.
I weren't doin' nowt wrong.

01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:57.290
l'd been up since six. I had to do t'papers,
then I had to rush home to look at t'bird,

01:18:57.384 --> 01:19:00.543
and then run to school.
You'd be tired, wouldn't yer, sir?

01:19:00.637 --> 01:19:02.586
l'd be exhausted.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.621
You shouldn't be caned for that, sir.
And you can't tell Mr Gryce that.

01:19:06.725 --> 01:19:11.719
And this little lad, sir. He'd only brought
a letter from a teacher, and he got t'cane.

01:19:12.564 --> 01:19:16.182
It's nowt to laugh at, sir.
Afterwards, he was sick as a dog.

01:19:17.485 --> 01:19:20.436
And teachers, sir.
They're not bothered about us, sir.

01:19:20.530 --> 01:19:23.939
lf we're 4C, they think
we're numbskulls, owt like that, sir.

01:19:24.033 --> 01:19:28.610
They're always lookin' at their watches,
to see how long there's left of t'lesson.

01:19:28.704 --> 01:19:32.645
They're not bothered about us,
and we're not bothered about them.

01:19:35.877 --> 01:19:38.202
How are things at home these days?

01:19:38.296 --> 01:19:40.704
All right, sir. Usual, I suppose.

01:19:40.798 --> 01:19:43.165
- Been in trouble with the police recently?
- No, sir.

01:19:43.258 --> 01:19:46.418
Not since I've been
without MacDowall's gang.

01:19:46.512 --> 01:19:50.505
You know, they used to go into t'city
and go into t'coffee bars and t'cinema,

01:19:50.599 --> 01:19:53.382
but since I've been without them
I've been all right.

01:19:53.476 --> 01:19:57.261
- It's all right now, innit?
- But when there's trouble on estate,

01:19:57.355 --> 01:20:00.305
all the police come to our house.

01:20:00.399 --> 01:20:02.599
Well, I shouldn't worry.

01:20:02.693 --> 01:20:06.634
ln a couple of weeks you'll be starting
your new job, gettin' new friends.

01:20:06.739 --> 01:20:11.483
Lookin' forward to that, are yer?
Eh? Have you got a job?

01:20:11.576 --> 01:20:13.943
No, sir. I've got to see
t'employment bloke.

01:20:14.037 --> 01:20:16.570
- What sort of job do you want?
- Anything'll do me.

01:20:16.664 --> 01:20:20.032
But you want something that
you're interested in, don't you?

01:20:20.126 --> 01:20:23.994
- I'll take what I've got.
- I thought you wanted to leave school.

01:20:24.088 --> 01:20:26.652
- Not bothered.
- Thought you didn't like school.

01:20:26.757 --> 01:20:31.292
I don't, but it dun't mean to say I'll like
work. Still, I'll get paid for not likin' it.

01:20:31.386 --> 01:20:34.420
- That's one thing.
- I suppose it is.

01:20:34.514 --> 01:20:38.507
I might be able to save up and buy
a goshawk. I've been readin' about 'em.

01:20:38.601 --> 01:20:41.009
Have yer? When do you fly
this hawk o' yours?

01:20:41.103 --> 01:20:42.844
- Dinner times.
- Where?

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:45.502
- Just outside our house, sir.
- Wood Lane?

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:49.226
- Yeah, it is, sir.
- I'll come round, then. lf it's OK.

01:20:51.404 --> 01:20:53.969
Go on, then. Get yourself cleaned up.

01:22:01.969 --> 01:22:06.379
"Five bob double.
Crackpot. Tell Him He's Dead."

01:22:06.473 --> 01:22:08.339
"Jud."

01:22:09.475 --> 01:22:11.551
Bloody hellfire!

01:22:41.087 --> 01:22:43.580
Kes! Come on, then.

01:22:45.216 --> 01:22:47.083
Kes!

01:22:47.677 --> 01:22:49.751
Come on, then, Kes.

01:22:50.638 --> 01:22:52.505
Come on.

01:22:58.353 --> 01:23:00.428
Come on, Kes.

01:23:04.484 --> 01:23:06.850
Casper?

01:23:06.944 --> 01:23:09.270
Bloody hellfire!

01:23:09.364 --> 01:23:12.898
- Hope I'm not too late.
- No. But you'll have to stand over there.

01:23:12.992 --> 01:23:15.556
- I'll go by the fence, eh?
- It's all right.

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:19.988
- As long as you keep quiet.
- I'll not say a word.

01:23:31.967 --> 01:23:34.043
Come on, Kes!

01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:41.007
Come on, Kes!

01:23:42.019 --> 01:23:43.884
Kes!

01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:48.305
Come on, Kes!

01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:54.061
Come on, Kes!

01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:58.315
Kes!

01:24:21.763 --> 01:24:26.632
Well done, Casper. The most exciting
thing I've ever seen in me life. Great!

01:24:27.518 --> 01:24:30.271
- Thrill of a lifetime, lad.
- Thank you, sir.

01:24:30.354 --> 01:24:33.137
Let's have a look at it.

01:24:33.231 --> 01:24:35.797
lsn't it beautifully marked, eh?

01:24:38.153 --> 01:24:41.812
Look at the feathers on it.
Oh, it's not gonna eat that, is it?

01:24:41.906 --> 01:24:44.742
Yes, sir. This bird's full of vitamins.

01:24:47.328 --> 01:24:49.194
Oh, dear!

01:24:50.748 --> 01:24:53.948
- Have any more birds before him?
- Stacks. Animals an' all.

01:24:54.042 --> 01:24:58.911
A young fox cub once.
Reared it and let it go. A little blinder!

01:24:59.005 --> 01:25:02.331
I've had magpies, jackdaws.
Had a young jay once.

01:25:04.552 --> 01:25:08.379
- He's your favourite, though.
- Others weren't int' same street.

01:25:08.472 --> 01:25:10.964
Come on, then. Come on.

01:25:17.272 --> 01:25:19.764
- Come on, sir.
- Oh, dear me!

01:25:22.693 --> 01:25:25.603
- Watch that mattress, sir. It's slippy.
- OK.

01:25:34.079 --> 01:25:36.571
Look what's left, sir.

01:25:37.707 --> 01:25:40.825
Only t'sparrow's leg.
Must have been hungry.

01:25:40.919 --> 01:25:43.368
Must have been starvin'.

01:25:43.462 --> 01:25:46.372
You hang on here. I'll put him ont' perch.

01:25:49.259 --> 01:25:51.125
Come on, then.

01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:08.130
You know, there's something
weird about it when it's flyin'.

01:26:09.069 --> 01:26:13.198
- Hawks are t'best fliers there is.
- No, I didn't mean that.

01:26:13.281 --> 01:26:17.493
When it's flyin', there's something
about it makes you feel strange.

01:26:17.577 --> 01:26:21.195
- ls it cos everythin' goes quiet?
- That's it, aye.

01:26:21.288 --> 01:26:25.824
Other folks have noticed that. I know
a farmer who says it's same wi' owls.

01:26:25.918 --> 01:26:29.859
You know, when they get
his mice in his yard at night.

01:26:29.963 --> 01:26:33.664
When they swoop down, he feels like
pokin' his ears to make 'em pop.

01:26:33.758 --> 01:26:36.375
Cos it goes that quiet.

01:26:36.469 --> 01:26:39.712
It's as if they're flying
in a pocket of silence.

01:26:39.806 --> 01:26:42.339
Have you noticed
how quietly we're speaking?

01:26:42.433 --> 01:26:47.177
As if we're frightened to raise our voices,
a bit like shouting in church.

01:26:47.271 --> 01:26:50.430
- It's cos they're nervous.
- Oh, no. It's more than that.

01:26:50.524 --> 01:26:54.016
It's instinctive. It's a sort of respect.

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:58.771
I know, sir. That's what makes me mad.
When I take her for walks, somebody says

01:26:58.865 --> 01:27:02.023
"Look, it's Billy Casper and his pet hawk."

01:27:02.117 --> 01:27:04.902
I could shout at 'em, sir. lt in't a pet.

01:27:04.995 --> 01:27:08.405
Or if somebody comes up to me
and says "ls it tame?"

01:27:08.499 --> 01:27:12.408
ls it heck tame! Hawks can't be tamed.

01:27:12.502 --> 01:27:17.371
They're manned. It's wild and it's fierce
and it's not bothered about anybody.

01:27:17.464 --> 01:27:21.406
Not bothered about me, right.
That's what makes it great.

01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:25.212
A lot of people wouldn't understand.
They like their pets to be fussed.

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:29.466
I'm not bothered about that.
I just want her for her looks and to fly her.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:33.136
They can keep their talkin' budgies.
They're nowt compared wi' her.

01:27:34.021 --> 01:27:36.587
You're right, Billy. You're probably right.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:42.602
D'you know summat, sir? I think she's
done me a favour, lettin' me watch her.

01:27:51.037 --> 01:27:53.738
"Same price, 7-1,
number 12, Doorkeeper."

01:27:53.832 --> 01:27:56.740
What's he studyin' there?

01:28:01.881 --> 01:28:04.445
- Can I help you, son?
- No, thanks.

01:28:06.968 --> 01:28:09.585
Hey, mister, can you
tell me t'prices of these?

01:28:09.679 --> 01:28:11.754
What are they?

01:28:12.557 --> 01:28:14.423
Crackpot.

01:28:15.267 --> 01:28:17.342
Crackpot. 100-6.

01:28:18.604 --> 01:28:22.545
Tell Him He's Dead.
I've just been lookin' for this one meself.

01:28:23.441 --> 01:28:26.142
Tell Him He's Dead.
Second favourite, 4-1 .

01:28:26.236 --> 01:28:28.310
100-6, 4-1 .

01:28:29.072 --> 01:28:31.397
Would you back 'em?

01:28:31.491 --> 01:28:35.735
Tell Him He's Dead's a good horse.
Best horse int' race. Top weight.

01:28:35.828 --> 01:28:38.237
Don't fancy that one, though.

01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:42.407
No form. Hasn't even got a jockey on
here. No, shouldn't bother with that one.

01:28:42.501 --> 01:28:44.742
D'yer think they'll win, then?

01:28:44.836 --> 01:28:47.673
- How've you got them? Doubled?
- They're our Jud's.

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:51.885
Oh, he'll be all right if they do,
but I can't see it meself.

01:28:51.968 --> 01:28:53.834
Right. Ta.

01:29:07.649 --> 01:29:11.809
- A bob's worth o' chips, and a fish.
- Serve him, will you, Mary?

01:29:12.821 --> 01:29:15.729
- Yes, love? What do you want?
- Fish 'n' chips.

01:29:17.658 --> 01:29:20.192
Stop kickin'. We only put that on today.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.061
- Got any scraps, missis?
- Yes, love. I'll put you some on.

01:29:26.082 --> 01:29:31.285
Two shilling, love. I'm gettin' rid of
these chips, Floyd. It's gettin' late now.

01:29:32.088 --> 01:29:34.371
Aye. But don't be goin' mad.

01:29:34.465 --> 01:29:36.540
Sixpence change, love.

01:29:42.055 --> 01:29:46.757
These kids. I don't know,
Mr Glover, they're just all the same.

01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.816
- Can I have a quarter o' beef?
- By, those smell good.

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:56.391
Can I have a quarter o' beef?

01:29:58.653 --> 01:30:01.021
- Tha stilI got that bird, then?
- Yep.

01:30:08.579 --> 01:30:11.144
- Here, you can have them for nowt.
- For nowt?

01:30:11.248 --> 01:30:13.490
- They're only scraps.
- Another chip?

01:30:13.584 --> 01:30:16.868
- No. I'm goin' for me dinner in a minute.
- Right, then. See yer.

01:30:16.962 --> 01:30:18.829
See yer.

01:30:47.365 --> 01:30:51.692
Usual difficulty
over concentration. Hm?

01:30:53.871 --> 01:30:55.821
Three fives are 15, eh?

01:30:55.915 --> 01:30:59.824
We write 15 one, five.
You write five, one.

01:31:03.421 --> 01:31:06.622
Oi, tha fuckin' twat!

01:31:07.717 --> 01:31:12.378
lsn't that that illustrious
brother of yours, Casper?

01:31:12.471 --> 01:31:17.840
Shouldn't have thought he was the type to
have paid a visit to his old school again.

01:31:19.019 --> 01:31:22.595
- What's the matter? Don't you feel well?
- No, sir.

01:31:22.689 --> 01:31:26.682
- Do you want to go for a drink of water?
- No, sir.

01:31:26.776 --> 01:31:30.060
- Well, open the window.
- I'm all right, sir.

01:31:31.196 --> 01:31:33.021
Please yourself.

01:31:35.701 --> 01:31:39.986
Right, now just pass your books forward,
will you? To the front.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:43.697
Front person on each row,
bring them to my desk, will you?

01:32:02.558 --> 01:32:05.050
What's the matter, Casper?
Lost something?

01:32:05.144 --> 01:32:07.709
- Me, sir? No, sir.
- On your way, then.

01:32:37.298 --> 01:32:41.709
- What's up with thee, Jud?
- It's that little bastard, our Billy.

01:32:41.803 --> 01:32:47.006
I left him with a bet for t'horses and he's
kept t'stinkin' money. I'll kill the little git!

01:32:54.731 --> 01:32:57.348
- What are you playing at?
- Goin' to t'toilet, sir.

01:32:57.442 --> 01:32:59.183
Hurry up, then.

01:33:21.005 --> 01:33:23.122
- I'm on 'ere!
- Seen our Billy?

01:33:23.215 --> 01:33:25.415
- Aye. He's here wi' me.
- Tryin' to be funny?

01:33:25.509 --> 01:33:29.210
Cos I'll stick thi head down there,
old pal, and flush it.

01:33:29.304 --> 01:33:32.255
- I asked if tha'd seen him.
- I wouldn't tell thee if I had.

01:33:32.349 --> 01:33:34.966
- Look, I'm warnin' yer!
- Ow!

01:35:32.208 --> 01:35:34.961
'Ey up, Tibbut, has tha seen our Jud?

01:35:35.044 --> 01:35:37.953
- They've been lookin' all over for thee.
- Who has?

01:35:38.047 --> 01:35:39.997
- Gryce Pudding.
- What for?

01:35:40.091 --> 01:35:42.999
Youth Employment.
Tha should have gone for t'interview.

01:35:43.093 --> 01:35:46.794
- Has tha seen our Jud?
- Yeah. He wanted to know where tha was.

01:35:50.057 --> 01:35:52.623
- Where the devil have you been?
- Nowhere, sir.

01:35:52.727 --> 01:35:54.927
Nowhere?
Who are you, the lnvisible Man?

01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:57.304
I felt sick, sir, so I went to t'toilets.

01:35:57.398 --> 01:36:01.391
What happened? Did you drop down it?
I've had prefects looking for you!

01:36:01.485 --> 01:36:04.769
- I went out for a breath of fresh air.
- Where are you going now?

01:36:04.863 --> 01:36:08.773
- Employment officer.
- For your interview? Get off, then, lad!

01:36:08.867 --> 01:36:10.941
And God help your future employer!

01:37:02.332 --> 01:37:05.001
- Sit up, Peter.
- I'm sat up.

01:37:06.127 --> 01:37:08.879
And don't be like a dummy
when you get in there.

01:37:08.963 --> 01:37:13.008
Just tell him you're after a good job,
in an office or something like that.

01:37:13.092 --> 01:37:15.657
I'm not working in no office!

01:37:15.761 --> 01:37:20.463
- What are you after? A job on the bins?
- Can't you shut up?

01:37:20.557 --> 01:37:22.382
- Sit up.
- I'm sat up.

01:37:22.475 --> 01:37:25.676
- And straighten your tie.
- Tha's naggin'.

01:37:26.521 --> 01:37:29.012
Somebody's got to nag.

01:37:35.571 --> 01:37:37.645
ls it yer mam?

01:37:38.323 --> 01:37:41.159
- What job are tha after?
- Owt'll do me.

01:37:41.242 --> 01:37:43.276
- lt certainly won't.
- lt will.

01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:45.444
- lt won't.
- Right. Thank you.

01:37:45.538 --> 01:37:47.738
Will you send the next one in?

01:37:47.832 --> 01:37:50.949
- Pardon?
- Will you send the next one in, please?

01:37:54.838 --> 01:37:57.674
- lsn't it your turn to go in?
- Suppose so.

01:37:58.299 --> 01:38:00.375
Well, go on, then.

01:38:17.151 --> 01:38:20.059
Get out! Knock and wait.

01:38:24.866 --> 01:38:27.024
Come in.

01:38:29.328 --> 01:38:31.893
Well, come in, lad, if you're coming.

01:38:34.582 --> 01:38:37.534
- Sit down, Walker.
- I'm not Walker, sir.

01:38:37.628 --> 01:38:40.953
Who are you, then? On my list
it should be Gerald Walker next.

01:38:41.047 --> 01:38:43.539
Oliver, Stenton, then Walker.

01:38:43.633 --> 01:38:45.958
- I'm Casper.
- Casper.

01:38:46.052 --> 01:38:50.212
Oh, sit down, Casper. I should
have seen you earlier, shouldn't I?

01:38:52.099 --> 01:38:55.716
Well, then, Casper,
what kind of job had you got in mind?

01:38:59.647 --> 01:39:01.389
Well?

01:39:01.482 --> 01:39:04.047
I don't know, sir.
I haven't thought about it.

01:39:04.151 --> 01:39:08.436
You should be thinking about it. You want
to start off on the right foot, don't you?

01:39:12.993 --> 01:39:15.558
Right, then.
Would you like to work in an office?

01:39:15.663 --> 01:39:19.823
- Or would you prefer manual work?
- What's manual work?

01:39:19.915 --> 01:39:24.075
lt means working with your hands. Things
like farming, engineering, plumbing.

01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:27.788
Things like that,
as opposed to penpushing jobs.

01:39:27.882 --> 01:39:31.823
l'd be all right in an office.
I have a job to read and write.

01:39:34.763 --> 01:39:36.629
"Manual".

01:39:38.016 --> 01:39:43.552
Tell me, Casper, have you ever thought
about entering a trade as an apprentice?

01:39:43.646 --> 01:39:47.692
You know, as an electrician
or a bricklayer or something like that.

01:39:47.775 --> 01:39:52.769
Of course, the money's not too good
while you're serving your apprenticeship,

01:39:52.863 --> 01:39:56.856
but you'll always have a trade
at your fingertips, won't you?

01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:59.275
Well, what do you think about it?

01:39:59.369 --> 01:40:04.154
As you've said, you feel better working
with your hands. Perhaps this is the best.

01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:09.243
Of course, you'd have to go to technical
college and study for examinations.

01:40:09.337 --> 01:40:12.996
Some lads do it. Some do it for years,
two or three nights a week,

01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:16.082
right from leaving school
right up to mid-twenties,

01:40:16.176 --> 01:40:19.794
when they take their Higher National,
or even degrees.

01:40:20.889 --> 01:40:23.380
I say, lad. Are you listening to me?

01:40:23.474 --> 01:40:25.925
- Yeah.
- You don't look as though you are.

01:40:26.017 --> 01:40:29.636
I've other lads to see
before four o'clock, you know.

01:40:30.689 --> 01:40:32.889
lf nothing I've mentioned appeals to you,

01:40:32.983 --> 01:40:36.475
and if you can stand a hard day's work
and don't mind getting dirty,

01:40:36.569 --> 01:40:40.145
- there are good opportunities in mining.
- I'm not goin' down t'pit.

01:40:40.239 --> 01:40:44.733
Don't be put off by what you've heard.
Conditions have improved tremendously.

01:40:44.827 --> 01:40:47.443
I wouldn't be seen dead down t'pit.

01:40:47.537 --> 01:40:50.572
What about hobbies?
What hobbies have you got?

01:40:50.666 --> 01:40:55.659
Do you like gardening, or constructing
Meccano sets, or anything like that?

01:40:56.587 --> 01:40:59.663
- Don't you have any hobbies at all?
- Can I go now?

01:40:59.757 --> 01:41:03.917
What's wrong with you, lad?
Sit down. Sit down, I haven't finished yet.

01:41:05.512 --> 01:41:09.047
I've met some lads in my time,
but I've never met one like you.

01:41:09.141 --> 01:41:13.843
Half the time you're like a cat on hot
bricks, the other half you're not listening.

01:41:13.937 --> 01:41:15.844
Here. Take this form.

01:41:15.938 --> 01:41:19.307
lt gives you information about
leaving school and starting work.

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.394
Things like pensions, superannuation,
national insurance, wages.

01:41:23.487 --> 01:41:27.700
At the back, there's a detachable form.
When you want your cards, fill it in...

01:41:27.783 --> 01:41:29.899
Come back, lad. I haven't finished yet.

01:41:29.993 --> 01:41:33.235
When you want your cards,
fill in that form, send it in. Got that?

01:41:33.329 --> 01:41:35.822
- Yeah.
- Don't forget. And listen, Casper.

01:41:35.916 --> 01:41:38.991
lf you do have trouble getting fixed up,
come in and see me.

01:41:39.085 --> 01:41:41.243
- Yeah.
- Send the next boy in.

01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:03.180
Kes!

01:42:06.776 --> 01:42:08.643
Kes!

01:42:10.488 --> 01:42:12.355
Kes!

01:42:17.953 --> 01:42:19.820
Kes!

01:42:22.207 --> 01:42:24.074
Kes!

01:42:34.552 --> 01:42:36.418
Jud?

01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:40.672
Jud?! Mother?!

01:42:44.478 --> 01:42:47.595
- Missis, have you seen our Jud?
- I haven't, love. Sorry.

01:42:53.945 --> 01:42:56.353
- Have you seen our Jud?
- Course I've seen him.

01:42:56.447 --> 01:42:59.814
- Doesn't look as though you've seen him.
- You've seen him, then?

01:42:59.908 --> 01:43:05.069
Course I've seen him. Come in here
playin' hell. Goin' to pull t'counter down.

01:43:05.163 --> 01:43:08.239
I had to fetch Eric Clough
to prove tha hadn't put t'bet on.

01:43:08.333 --> 01:43:11.366
- They won, then, did they?
- Both of 'em. 100-6 and 4-1 .

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:15.162
- He'd have won a tenner, I tell thee that.
- Bloody hell.

01:43:15.256 --> 01:43:17.122
Kes!

01:43:20.635 --> 01:43:22.711
Come on, Kes!

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:25.505
Come on, lass!

01:43:38.068 --> 01:43:39.935
Kes!

01:43:42.906 --> 01:43:44.772
Kes!

01:44:05.259 --> 01:44:07.335
Come on, Kes!

01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:53.377
Kes!

01:45:08.401 --> 01:45:10.267
Kes!

01:45:37.344 --> 01:45:41.879
- Where is it? What's tha done wi' it?
- Where've you been? Your tea's cold.

01:45:41.973 --> 01:45:44.464
I said, where is it?

01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:49.010
- What's tha starin' at?
- Thee, tha little pig!

01:45:49.104 --> 01:45:51.013
Don't call me a little pig!

01:45:51.107 --> 01:45:53.942
Hey! Hey!

01:45:54.026 --> 01:45:56.778
Jud, what's all t'bloody
pushin' and shovin'?

01:45:56.861 --> 01:46:00.729
- Ask him. He knows.
- Tha'd have known if l'd got hold o' thee.

01:46:00.823 --> 01:46:02.732
- Oh, get lost!
- Knows what?

01:46:02.825 --> 01:46:05.317
What's goin' off? What's up wi' him?

01:46:05.411 --> 01:46:08.945
lf he'd have put that bet on,
there wouldn't have been none of this.

01:46:09.039 --> 01:46:11.709
- He's put it on, hasn't he?
- Has he bloody hell!

01:46:11.792 --> 01:46:15.869
- I told him to. I asked you not to forget.
- He didn't forget. He spent t'money!

01:46:15.963 --> 01:46:17.536
How d'you know?

01:46:17.630 --> 01:46:20.582

Have they won?

01:46:20.675 --> 01:46:25.044
Have they won?! l'd have 16 quid
if he'd kept his thieving hands to hisself.

01:46:25.138 --> 01:46:27.973
- Look what you've done.

01:46:28.057 --> 01:46:31.299

01:46:31.393 --> 01:46:33.801
Hey! Well, what's he upset for?

01:46:33.895 --> 01:46:36.971
Because he's killed me hawk instead,
that's why.

01:46:37.065 --> 01:46:40.767
- He never has.
- I know he has. Cos he couldn't catch me.

01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:46.062
- Jud! You have not killed this kid's hawk!
- So I have. What yer gonna do about it?

01:46:46.156 --> 01:46:48.231
Killing yerself, that's what you want!

01:46:48.325 --> 01:46:51.234
lt were its own fault.
I were only gonna let it go.

01:47:02.963 --> 01:47:07.666
- Enough of that language!

01:47:07.759 --> 01:47:10.168
