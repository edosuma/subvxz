WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.280
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.418 --> 00:07.248
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.386 --> 00:11.804
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.942 --> 00:14.807
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.945 --> 00:17.741
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.879 --> 00:21.883
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.506 --> 00:26.026
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.164 --> 00:28.683
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.821 --> 00:31.272
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.410 --> 00:33.930
Just to get up that hill

00:34.068 --> 00:36.519
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.657 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.627
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.765 --> 00:43.353
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.491 --> 00:46.149
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.152
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.290 --> 00:53.743
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.881 --> 00:56.608
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.746 --> 00:59.645
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.783 --> 01:05.617
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:08.792 --> 01:10.173
Thank you.

01:14.522 --> 01:16.110
Hi. How are you?

01:18.181 --> 01:19.596
Hey, Mr. Jefferson!

01:19.734 --> 01:21.357
Quick, Marcus,
I got some pizza
for you.

01:21.495 --> 01:24.222
Oh, thanks.
But I hate pizza.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.706
I don't care.
All you gotta
do is eat it

01:25.844 --> 01:27.121
when Papa Panelli
gets here.

01:27.259 --> 01:29.710
Papa Panelli?
Oh, Papa Panelli
Pizza Parlors?

01:29.848 --> 01:32.299
Yep. I'm trying to get
his cleaning business.

01:32.437 --> 01:34.370
Mr. Jefferson?
Yeah?

01:34.508 --> 01:37.027
I'm Morrie Jacobs.
So?

01:37.166 --> 01:39.582
Well, I spoke to you
on the phone this morning.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.721
No, you didn't.

01:43.931 --> 01:46.106
Hey, I'm Papa Panelli!

01:46.244 --> 01:49.109
Papa Panelli!

01:49.247 --> 01:51.939
I didn't recognize
your voice without
the moustache.

01:53.009 --> 01:54.183
I don't understand though.

01:54.321 --> 01:55.632
If your name
is Morrie Jacobs,

01:55.770 --> 01:57.393
why do you call
your places Panelli's?

01:57.531 --> 01:59.671
Because, Sonny,
when you hear Panelli,

01:59.809 --> 02:01.362
you think Italian, see?

02:01.500 --> 02:04.262
I'm just giving
the people
what they want.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.091
That's right, Marcus,
that's business.

02:06.229 --> 02:09.439
Uh, no, Jefferson.
That's a Morrie!

02:12.684 --> 02:14.134
You get it?

02:14.272 --> 02:16.239
Morrie.
That's my name.

02:16.377 --> 02:19.484
Morrie Jacobs.
That's a Morrie!

02:19.622 --> 02:22.245
Oh! Yeah, yeah.

02:22.383 --> 02:24.765
Oh, I, uh...
I see you have
one of my pizzas.

02:24.903 --> 02:26.353
Oh, oh, yeah.

02:26.491 --> 02:28.217
That's the best pizza
in town, right, Marcus?

02:28.355 --> 02:30.529
Oh, yeah.
It's terrific.

02:35.741 --> 02:37.433
Oh... Mmm.

02:37.571 --> 02:40.298
So, you want
my cleaning business,
huh, Jefferson?

02:40.436 --> 02:41.609
That's right.

02:41.747 --> 02:44.647
Well, I don't know.
You look kind
of small to me.

02:44.785 --> 02:46.269
I'm just as tall
as you are.

02:48.271 --> 02:50.377
I'm talking about
your operation.

02:50.515 --> 02:53.587
You know,
I have 22 parlors,
just in Manhattan alone.

02:53.725 --> 02:56.245
And next year,
I'm gonna be spreading
my tomato sauce

02:56.383 --> 02:58.039
all over New Jersey.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.593
Yeah? And after
you finish spreading it,

02:59.731 --> 03:01.664
I'll be right there
to clean it up.

03:02.630 --> 03:04.218
I don't know, Jefferson.

03:04.356 --> 03:06.807
Are you sure
you can handle
a volume business?

03:06.945 --> 03:08.360
What are you
talking about?

03:08.498 --> 03:10.983
Junior's Fish and Chips
has 38 locations
in the city,

03:11.121 --> 03:13.158
and I ain't got
no complaints
from them.

03:13.296 --> 03:15.333
Junior's Fish and Chips?
When did you get...

03:15.471 --> 03:17.887
Here, have some
more pizza.
Oh...

03:20.200 --> 03:21.960
Junior's Fish and Chips,
huh?

03:22.098 --> 03:24.963
Oh, that's one of
the fastest growing chains
on the East Coast.

03:25.101 --> 03:27.241
That's right.
And I'm growing
right with them.

03:27.379 --> 03:30.865
Well, I'm gonna take
that into consideration,
Jefferson.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.108
I like a go-getter.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.592
Oh, well, look,
in that case,

03:33.730 --> 03:35.422
why don't you just
go get the contract

03:35.560 --> 03:37.251
and we'll settle
the deal right now.

03:37.389 --> 03:39.495
Well, I'd like
to think it over.

03:39.633 --> 03:43.223
As we say
in the pizza business,
"Haste makes paste."

03:43.775 --> 03:45.570
Oh...

03:45.708 --> 03:47.813
That's a good one, huh?
Oh...

03:47.951 --> 03:49.712
Well, I'll be
in touch with you
in a couple of days.

03:49.850 --> 03:51.334
Okay, I'll hear
from you soon, Jacobs.

03:51.472 --> 03:52.646
And remember...

03:52.784 --> 03:54.751
Try my pizza today

03:54.889 --> 03:58.307
And you're sure to say,
"That's-a-Morrie"

04:05.003 --> 04:06.591
Congratulations,
Mr. Jefferson.

04:06.729 --> 04:08.938
When did you land
the Junior Fish
and Chips account?

04:09.076 --> 04:11.216
I didn't.
You didn't?

04:11.354 --> 04:13.391
But you told
Mr. Jacobs you did.

04:13.529 --> 04:16.359
See, you see that,
you weren't listening.

04:16.497 --> 04:19.051
I told him I got
no complaints
from them.

04:21.468 --> 04:22.676
Oh...

04:24.125 --> 04:25.575
But ain't that
a little shady?

04:25.713 --> 04:27.853
Well, of course not.
It's done all the time
in business.

04:27.991 --> 04:29.510
Of course,
I do it better
than most.

04:29.648 --> 04:31.512
I call it
the Jefferson Curve.

04:32.341 --> 04:34.170
The Jefferson Curve?
That's right.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.414
I just throw them whatever
I want them to know.

04:37.829 --> 04:41.488
Mr. Jefferson,
now I see why
you're No.1.

04:41.626 --> 04:43.800
That's the only number
I know.
All right!

04:45.664 --> 04:47.528
What are you
two celebrating?

04:47.666 --> 04:49.323
Oh, hi,
Miss Jefferson,
Lionel.

04:49.461 --> 04:51.843
We just celebrating
your husband's brain.

04:51.981 --> 04:54.155
Oh, I thought
it was something big.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.540
Oh, hey, Pop...

04:59.678 --> 05:02.785
Oh, well, Lionel,
what are you doing here?
You lost?

05:02.923 --> 05:06.444
Well, I know I haven't
seen you for a while,
but I've been very busy.

05:06.582 --> 05:09.101
Oh. Too busy to see
your own mother
and father, huh?

05:09.239 --> 05:10.758
Now see, Pop,
do you know something?

05:10.896 --> 05:12.070
I should be
at work right now,

05:12.208 --> 05:14.072
but I sneaked out just
to say hello to you.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.625
Oh, you did? Huh...

05:15.763 --> 05:18.939
Well,
good to see you.

05:19.077 --> 05:21.251
Can you stay a while?
Oh, man,
I wish I could.

05:21.390 --> 05:22.908
But I really gotta
get right back.

05:23.046 --> 05:25.842
And we have to go,
too, George.
Go where?

05:26.705 --> 05:28.293
You've forgotten again.

05:28.431 --> 05:31.020
I ain't forgotten again.
Forgot what?

05:32.401 --> 05:35.611
You're impossible.
The charity dinner tonight!

05:35.749 --> 05:39.373
Oh, is that tonight,
Weezy? Look, I'm bushed.
Why don't you take Lionel?

05:39.511 --> 05:42.238
Oh, sorry, Pop,
I'm really working hard
on this special project,

05:42.376 --> 05:43.895
so all my nights
are full.

05:44.033 --> 05:45.759
You know, I hardly get
to see Jenny anymore.

05:45.897 --> 05:48.002
Well, that's one
good thing in your favor.

05:50.557 --> 05:53.111
George, unless you go
with me tonight,

05:53.249 --> 05:55.285
I'm going with
your best friend.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.357
And who's my best friend?

05:57.495 --> 05:58.634
Your checkbook.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.430
Now unless you're there
to stop me,

06:01.568 --> 06:03.708
I just might
get carried away

06:03.846 --> 06:05.503
and make another
big donation.

06:05.641 --> 06:07.332
Ah...

06:07.470 --> 06:09.161
See you later,
Marcus.
Right.

06:09.299 --> 06:10.853
Ciao, Miss Jefferson,
Lionel.

06:10.991 --> 06:12.751
LOUISE:
Goodbye, Marcus.
There you go.

06:22.727 --> 06:24.522
I'm the Papa Panelli.

06:26.627 --> 06:27.766
Hey...

06:27.904 --> 06:30.217
I'll take two to go,
but hold the anchovies.

06:30.355 --> 06:33.669
Oh, oh, yeah.
What can I do for you?

06:33.807 --> 06:35.429
Well, you can help me
with these clothes.

06:35.567 --> 06:36.672
Oh, sure.

06:38.018 --> 06:41.539
Say, you one foxy lady.

06:41.677 --> 06:43.126
Where you been
hiding yourself?

06:43.264 --> 06:45.197
From you.

06:45.335 --> 06:48.028
Be extra...
Be extra careful
with this blouse

06:48.166 --> 06:50.513
'cause it's very delicate.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

06:50.651 --> 06:53.516
I'll bet this looks
fantastic on you.

06:53.654 --> 06:55.829
Well, you'll never know,
will you?

06:55.967 --> 06:57.831
May I have my ticket,
please?

06:57.969 --> 07:00.109
You mean
a one-way ticket
to my heart?

07:00.247 --> 07:02.801
How 'bout a round trip
transfer to my foot?

07:05.148 --> 07:07.012
What's your name, sister?

07:07.150 --> 07:09.256
Hey, look, I just
came in here to...
Oh, don't get upset.

07:09.394 --> 07:12.259
Don't get upset.
It's for the ticket.

07:12.397 --> 07:13.743
Oh.

07:13.881 --> 07:15.504
Um, Natalie Parker.

07:15.642 --> 07:17.540
Natalie...

07:17.678 --> 07:19.956
That's a beautiful name.
Mine's Marcus.

07:20.094 --> 07:22.511
Hi, Marcus.
Address?

07:22.649 --> 07:27.481
Uh, 629, East 72nd Street,
Penthouse Apartment.

07:29.034 --> 07:31.623
Now why would
a fine fox like you
wanna live way up

07:31.761 --> 07:33.004
in some penthouse

07:33.142 --> 07:36.041
when you should
be out in full view?

07:36.179 --> 07:40.183
Well, this is one fox
that doesn't like being
chased by hounds.

07:42.047 --> 07:44.705
That's why you need
somebody to watch over you,

07:44.843 --> 07:46.569
to keep them hounds away.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.571
And you think
you're that someone?

07:49.365 --> 07:50.400
I know it.

07:51.850 --> 07:53.818
What time should
I pick you up tonight?

07:55.095 --> 07:56.614
What makes you think
I'd wanna go out

07:56.752 --> 07:58.167
with a clerk
in a cleaning store?

07:58.305 --> 08:01.619
Oh, hey,
you got it all wrong.
Oh, I do, huh?

08:01.757 --> 08:04.932
Sure. Even Nelson
Rockefeller's daddy
made him start off

08:05.070 --> 08:06.969
by sweeping up
the loose change.

08:07.107 --> 08:08.453
What?

08:08.591 --> 08:11.698
Well, you know
how fathers are.

08:11.836 --> 08:13.665
You mean your father
owns this place?

08:14.148 --> 08:15.253
Well...

08:15.391 --> 08:17.048
And he makes you
work here as a clerk?

08:17.186 --> 08:19.291
Let's just say,
the old man wants me

08:19.429 --> 08:21.431
to experience
the entire operation

08:21.570 --> 08:24.331
before I move into
the executive offices.

08:24.469 --> 08:27.058
You've got a lot
of moves, all right.

08:27.196 --> 08:30.130
Speaking of moves,
Dr. J's in town.

08:30.268 --> 08:32.753
And I just happen to have
two tickets to the Garden.

08:32.891 --> 08:36.067
How'd you like to go
to a basketball game
with me?

08:36.205 --> 08:38.794
Well, I, um... I...
I'll pick you up
at 7:30.

08:40.347 --> 08:42.832
I'd love to.

08:42.970 --> 08:45.455
But only
on one condition.
Anything.

08:45.594 --> 08:48.251
You gotta promise
not to wear that hat.

08:48.389 --> 08:49.529
Oh...

08:54.395 --> 08:55.673
Whoo!

08:57.675 --> 09:01.644
The Jefferson Curve...
You're breaking just right!

09:07.788 --> 09:09.238
It's your turn.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.076
Oh, hi, Marcus.

09:20.214 --> 09:22.113
Hey, Miss Jefferson.
Here's your cleaning.
See you later.

09:22.251 --> 09:23.666
Oh, Marcus,
what's the hurry?

09:23.804 --> 09:25.806
Why don't you come in,
sit down and relax?

09:25.944 --> 09:28.913
Mr. Jefferson won't mind.
No, but my girl will.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.053
Your girl?

09:31.191 --> 09:32.502
Yeah, you know,
I've been dating her
for the past week,

09:32.641 --> 09:33.849
and I got to
hurry up downtown

09:33.987 --> 09:35.575
and pick up this
bracelet I bought her.

09:35.713 --> 09:37.335
You've only been
dating her a week

09:37.473 --> 09:39.406
and already you're buying
her a bracelet?

09:39.544 --> 09:41.201
That ain't nothing.

09:41.339 --> 09:43.928
I went out with this guy,
and on our first date
he gave me a ring.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.137
Really?

09:46.275 --> 09:48.035
Yeah, but he ate up
all the Cracker Jacks.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.733
I'd like to
meet your girl.

09:55.871 --> 09:57.113
Why don't you
bring her over?

09:57.666 --> 09:59.599
Oh, uh, well, uh...

09:59.737 --> 10:02.463
You see, she goes
to school in Connecticut,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.914
and she'll be leaving
in a couple of days.

10:05.052 --> 10:06.916
We'll be home tonight.

10:07.054 --> 10:11.714
Tonight? Uh, well, uh,
we're going out tonight.
Sorry.

10:11.852 --> 10:13.958
But...
I really gotta be going,
Miss Jefferson.

10:14.096 --> 10:15.338
Bye, Florence.

10:17.927 --> 10:20.758
Isn't young love wonderful?

10:20.896 --> 10:24.002
I remember
when George and I
first started dating.

10:24.140 --> 10:26.867
He would knock
on the door all nervous.

10:27.005 --> 10:28.455
What was he nervous about?

10:28.593 --> 10:30.664
We had a dog
bigger than he was.

10:32.321 --> 10:34.150
What did you have,
a Chihuahua?

10:42.296 --> 10:44.264
Hi. I'm Natalie Parker.

10:44.402 --> 10:45.990
Hi. I'm George Jefferson.

10:46.128 --> 10:48.509
I know. I've heard
a lot about you.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.237
Oh, you have, huh?
Well, let me tell
you something.

10:52.375 --> 10:56.483
Don't believe
everything you hear.
Just the good things.

10:56.621 --> 11:00.073
Well, your son has only
good things to say
about you, Mr. Jefferson.

11:00.211 --> 11:01.626
My son?
You know my son?

11:01.764 --> 11:03.663
Yeah. We've been
dating all week.

11:03.801 --> 11:05.665
Oh, that's nice.

11:05.803 --> 11:07.563
Hello?
What'd you say?

11:09.392 --> 11:10.980
No, not you, Panelli.

11:11.118 --> 11:12.361
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferson.

11:12.499 --> 11:14.777
Hey, wait a minute,
I wanna talk to you
about Lionel!

11:14.915 --> 11:16.745
No, not you, Panelli!
You don't even know Lionel!

11:16.883 --> 11:17.918
Hey!

11:23.199 --> 11:24.511
Oh, Lionel.

11:30.586 --> 11:32.692
Well, at least I'm gonna
call Lionel at work

11:32.830 --> 11:34.728
and get to
the bottom of this.

11:36.488 --> 11:39.422
I'm sure there must
be some explanation.

11:39.560 --> 11:43.081
Oh, hello.
May I please speak
with Lionel Jefferson?

11:44.289 --> 11:46.740
Lionel messing around...

11:47.258 --> 11:48.742
That's ridiculous.

11:49.950 --> 11:54.748
Oh, hello, Lionel.
How are you, sweetheart?

11:54.886 --> 11:58.890
Oh, nothing, dear.
I just wanted to see
how you were doing,

11:59.028 --> 12:00.823
and what
you've been doing.

12:03.584 --> 12:05.897
Oh, you've been
very busy every night?

12:06.035 --> 12:07.450
Give me that phone!

12:07.588 --> 12:09.452
Lionel, hi.

12:09.590 --> 12:13.180
Yeah, this is your father.
Look, I wanna see
you tonight.

12:13.318 --> 12:16.874
Yeah, I know all about
this special project
you've been working on.

12:17.012 --> 12:19.221
Look, just get
your butt over here!
Bye!

12:22.051 --> 12:25.917
It's true!
Lionel really is
cheating on Jenny.

12:26.055 --> 12:29.334
Lionel cheating on Jenny?
What makes you think that?

12:29.472 --> 12:31.026
We just put
two and two together.

12:31.164 --> 12:32.855
And came up with three.

12:33.891 --> 12:37.066
Lionel, Jenny,
and that other woman.

12:39.241 --> 12:41.933
Oh, George...
For shame, for shame.

12:42.071 --> 12:43.728
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

12:45.281 --> 12:48.940
Oh, George,
I just can't understand it.

12:49.078 --> 12:52.910
Lionel and Jenny seem
to have been so happy.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.188
Oh, Tom.

12:56.948 --> 12:58.294
Hello, Louise.

12:59.537 --> 13:02.126
Oh, George,
I spoke with Lionel
this afternoon.

13:02.678 --> 13:03.921
You did?

13:04.059 --> 13:05.992
I know what
he's going through.
You do?

13:07.303 --> 13:10.375
Yes. And I have
total sympathy for him.

13:10.513 --> 13:13.689
Oh, does...
Does Jenny know
about Lionel?

13:13.827 --> 13:16.243
Well, of course.
How did she find out?

13:17.279 --> 13:19.419
Well, Lionel told her,
of course.

13:20.938 --> 13:22.802
I don't understand
these kids today.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.527
How is Jenny taking it?

13:24.665 --> 13:27.082
Oh, she understands.
She does?

13:27.220 --> 13:29.153
Yes. But I'm sure
she'll be glad

13:29.291 --> 13:31.396
when Lionel's
special project
is finished,

13:31.534 --> 13:33.398
and he won't have to
put in so much overtime.

13:34.261 --> 13:35.780
Overtime?

13:35.918 --> 13:39.025
Oh, oh, yes,
overtime.

13:39.888 --> 13:41.579
Well, that's why
I'm here, Louise.

13:41.717 --> 13:44.375
You see, we were going
to take the kids to
the Swedish Film Festival.

13:44.513 --> 13:47.861
But with Lionel
working late,
we have an extra ticket.

13:47.999 --> 13:50.105
And Helen thought
that you might like it.

13:50.243 --> 13:53.591
Oh, too bad. We're busy.
She can't go. Willis, bye.

13:54.764 --> 13:57.353
Lionel fooling around
with another woman.

13:57.491 --> 13:59.010
I still can't believe it.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.703
What did she say?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.913
Nothing! Look, hurry up,
Willis, you're gonna be
late for the movie!

14:05.051 --> 14:06.328
If I heard
Florence correctly,

14:06.466 --> 14:08.054
I'd like
an explanation.

14:08.192 --> 14:10.539
Okay, the explanation
is Florence is a dummy.

14:10.677 --> 14:13.300
She don't know what
she's talking about.
Bye.

14:13.438 --> 14:17.718
Louise, is Lionel
really fooling around
with another woman?

14:18.512 --> 14:19.962
I'm afraid so.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.690
Oh, my poor baby.

14:23.828 --> 14:27.556
And to think we trusted
Lionel with our Jenny
and now this!

14:27.694 --> 14:29.765
Now what they should
do is turn to the Lord.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.974
He's the only one that
can save that marriage.

14:32.112 --> 14:33.769
He's gonna have
his hands full
saving you,

14:33.907 --> 14:35.805
if you don't mind
your damn business!

14:39.740 --> 14:41.950
I should have known
any son of yours
couldn't be trusted.

14:42.088 --> 14:43.468
Don't be telling me
about my son!

14:43.606 --> 14:45.194
What about
your daughter?
What about my daughter?

14:45.332 --> 14:47.852
Well, obviously,
she ain't been giving
Lionel what he needs.

14:50.959 --> 14:54.307
Oh, you're so right.
What he needs is
a good punch in the mouth!

14:54.445 --> 14:55.687
Are you threatening my son?

14:55.825 --> 14:57.620
Well, how would
you feel if Jenny
were your daughter?

14:57.758 --> 14:58.863
Terrible!
See?

14:59.001 --> 15:00.520
'Cause then I'd be white.

15:04.558 --> 15:06.526
Will you two stop it?

15:06.664 --> 15:09.943
Oh, poor Helen.
We can't let
her find out.

15:10.081 --> 15:12.083
Well, just don't
tell her about it.
Right.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.224
Helen, guess what,
Lionel is...

15:15.362 --> 15:16.812
Jenny!

15:18.193 --> 15:21.575
Hi, darling.
What are you doing here?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.474
Aren't we supposed
to be going
to the film festival?

15:23.612 --> 15:24.578
What festival?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.580
Oh, yes,
the festival,
okay.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.997
Did Tom tell you about
the extra ticket, Louise?

15:29.135 --> 15:33.208
Oh, yes. Thanks, Helen,
but I'm afraid I won't
be able to make it.

15:33.346 --> 15:36.142
Oh, well, then maybe
next time, girl.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.420
Tom, now what were
you going to tell me
about Lionel?

15:38.558 --> 15:41.250
Uh, uh, Lionel...

15:41.388 --> 15:44.840
Uh, Tom was just saying
what a shame it is

15:44.978 --> 15:47.636
that Lionel won't
be able to go
with you tonight.

15:47.774 --> 15:49.672
Yeah, it is a shame.

15:49.810 --> 15:52.020
I'll be happy
when Lionel's project
is finished.

15:52.158 --> 15:53.435
It won't be long.

15:55.575 --> 15:57.957
Uh, Jenny,
what did you have
for dinner tonight?

15:58.095 --> 16:01.236
Oh, nothing.
I hate eating alone
every night.

16:01.374 --> 16:04.653
Oh, well, you shouldn't be
going out without eating.

16:04.791 --> 16:06.482
Why don't you go
fix a sandwich?

16:06.620 --> 16:08.726
Well, I...
Oh, that's a good idea.

16:08.864 --> 16:12.040
We still have plenty
of time before
the show starts.

16:12.178 --> 16:14.732
Well, okay.
Well, thanks a lot.
I was...

16:14.870 --> 16:17.666
Oh, you're welcome.
You're welcome.

16:17.804 --> 16:20.013
Is something going on
I don't know about?

16:20.151 --> 16:22.084
Well, Helen...

16:22.774 --> 16:23.983
Helen...

16:26.571 --> 16:28.435
Helen, I think
you better sit down.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.922
Tom, what's going on?

16:33.061 --> 16:35.477
I'll get right
to the point.
You see...

16:36.650 --> 16:39.584
Uh... Well, you see,
I have this friend

16:39.722 --> 16:43.588
who's son-in-law
has been seeing
this other woman.

16:43.726 --> 16:46.591
Now his parents know,
and his father-in-law knows,

16:46.729 --> 16:51.079
but his mother-in-law,
and my friend's daughter
don't know. So...

16:51.217 --> 16:52.804
Lionel's seeing
another woman?

16:52.942 --> 16:55.911
Oh, Louise...
Oh, Helen...

16:57.740 --> 17:00.433
Now you see what
you did, Willis?
Me?

17:00.571 --> 17:02.331
This is all
your son's fault!
What?

17:02.469 --> 17:03.505
Yes, it is!
Oh, how...

17:03.643 --> 17:07.095
Quit hollerin'!
Jenny's gonna hear.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.994
Hear what?
Um, hear the end
of the movie.

17:10.857 --> 17:12.548
Um, Mr. Jefferson
saw it already.

17:13.411 --> 17:15.137
Mom, are you upset
about something?

17:15.275 --> 17:19.107
Upset? Oh, yes,
about the ending
of the movie.

17:19.245 --> 17:22.110
It's so sad.
I almost feel
like crying.

17:22.248 --> 17:25.665
Oh, well,
don't tell me how it ends.
I wanna be surprised.

17:25.803 --> 17:28.564
Florence, go and keep
her in there, please?

17:28.702 --> 17:31.222
Okay, but keep notes.
I don't wanna miss
none of this.

17:34.432 --> 17:36.193
We'll all wait
for Lionel.

17:36.331 --> 17:38.471
That's gotta be him.

17:44.201 --> 17:46.168
Hello, Mrs. Jefferson?

17:46.306 --> 17:48.757
Yes?
I'm Natalie Parker.

17:48.895 --> 17:51.070
The doorman said
you lived here.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.658
I was supposed to meet
your son downstairs...

17:53.796 --> 17:55.004
That's her!
Who?

17:56.627 --> 17:58.594
The other woman!
Oh...

17:58.732 --> 18:01.218
Jenny, are you sure
you don't want no tomato
on that sandwich?

18:01.356 --> 18:03.530
Yes, Florence,
I'm sure.
Well...

18:03.668 --> 18:04.807
What are you doing?

18:04.945 --> 18:06.775
Ah, we're giving
a surprise party.

18:06.913 --> 18:09.812
Now don't come out
until you hear us
yell "surprise".

18:12.746 --> 18:13.989
Oh, who was that girl?

18:15.128 --> 18:16.198
Girl?

18:18.373 --> 18:19.650
What girl?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.068
The one you just pushed
into the bathroom.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.418
Oh, that's the plumber.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.908
And since when
do plumbers dress
like that?

18:37.046 --> 18:40.671
At $25 an hour,
they can dress
anyway they like.

18:46.539 --> 18:47.678
Okay,
what's going on here?

18:47.816 --> 18:49.921
You're all acting
very strange.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.132
Tom, I don't think
we can keep it
from her any longer.

18:53.270 --> 18:55.582
Well, keep...
Keep what?
You're right, Helen.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.240
You'd better tell her.

18:59.310 --> 19:00.863
Jenny, you see...

19:01.001 --> 19:02.865
You see...
Oh, I'll get it.

19:04.626 --> 19:06.869
Lionel!
Oh, hi, Mrs. Willis.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.769
Oh! So that's it.

19:09.907 --> 19:12.323
You talked Lionel
into taking the night off.

19:12.461 --> 19:14.360
Hey, Jenny...

19:14.498 --> 19:17.397
Oh, baby...
Hey, what are
you doing here?

19:17.535 --> 19:19.813
Well,
I'm still your wife,
remember?

19:19.951 --> 19:21.712
I know you've probably
forgotten what I look like
by now,

19:21.850 --> 19:23.265
but I can prove it.
Jenny, now...

19:23.403 --> 19:24.956
I got this little mole
on the left side...

19:25.094 --> 19:27.614
I remember.
Oh, do I remember...

19:29.478 --> 19:31.239
How dare you do that!

19:33.931 --> 19:36.105
It's okay, Mr. Willis.
We are married.

19:36.727 --> 19:38.556
Oh, George!

19:50.775 --> 19:52.605
I'm really ashamed of you.

19:53.295 --> 19:54.262
What?

19:56.781 --> 19:58.749
Hey, Pop,
why did you call me
over here, huh?

19:58.887 --> 20:01.303
Oh, so that's it.

20:01.441 --> 20:04.789
This was all to give me
a lovely surprise.

20:06.170 --> 20:07.689
Surprise!

20:11.002 --> 20:12.107
Who is she?

20:12.659 --> 20:13.833
The plumber.

20:15.628 --> 20:18.769
Okay, Casanova,
let's see you worm
your way out of this one.

20:20.943 --> 20:22.497
So you're the plumber.

20:22.635 --> 20:24.015
Hi. I'm Lionel Jefferson.

20:24.153 --> 20:26.639
It's no use, Lionel.
We know.

20:27.571 --> 20:28.813
You know what?

20:28.951 --> 20:30.229
About your girlfriend.

20:30.367 --> 20:32.161
What girlfriend?

20:32.300 --> 20:33.404
Well, look, baby,
don't look at me,

20:33.542 --> 20:35.406
'cause I don't know
what they're talking about.

20:35.544 --> 20:38.720
Pitiful.
He clings to the lie
when the truth...

20:40.618 --> 20:43.483
The truth is staring him
right in the face.

20:43.621 --> 20:46.693
All right,
will somebody please tell
me what's going on here?

20:49.282 --> 20:51.802
I wanted to tell...
I want... I...

20:51.940 --> 20:52.975
Hold it!

20:55.288 --> 20:56.496
Are you all crazy?

20:57.532 --> 20:59.188
I'm not the plumber.

20:59.327 --> 21:02.571
I just came up here
to find out why
your son stood me up.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.265
Oh, woman,
I didn't stand you up!

21:08.405 --> 21:09.716
I don't even know you!

21:09.854 --> 21:11.856
Well, I'm not
talking about you.

21:12.547 --> 21:13.858
Then who?

21:13.996 --> 21:15.308
Hey, everybody,
have you seen...

21:15.446 --> 21:16.965
Thank God.

21:17.103 --> 21:18.898
Is your family
always this crazy?

21:19.036 --> 21:20.796
Oh, yeah,
my family's real crazy.

21:20.934 --> 21:22.522
Goodnight, folks,
see you later.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.731
Marcus! Marcus!

21:24.869 --> 21:27.562
Will you cut the nonsense
and tell us what's going on?

21:27.700 --> 21:29.253
As soon as I get back,
Mom.

21:29.391 --> 21:30.944
Mom?
Marcus!

21:32.256 --> 21:33.809
You come back
in here and tell us
what's happening!

21:33.947 --> 21:36.018
Later. I promise, Dad.

21:36.156 --> 21:38.124
Dad? Hey! Come back.

21:40.609 --> 21:43.336
Now where is all this
mommin' and daddin'
coming from?

21:44.233 --> 21:45.994
Well...

21:50.861 --> 21:52.103
Okay...

21:54.174 --> 21:55.969
Look at Natalie.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.282
She lives in a penthouse.

21:58.420 --> 22:01.078
She goes to
a private school.

22:01.216 --> 22:02.700
So when she came
into the store last week,

22:02.838 --> 22:05.185
I knew she'd never look
at nothin' like me.

22:06.152 --> 22:08.810
So I sort of gave her
the impression

22:08.948 --> 22:11.951
that Mr. Jefferson here
was my father.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.334
You mean these
aren't your parents?

22:16.127 --> 22:18.198
No. I'm Marcus Henderson.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.718
Part-time clerk
and full-time liar.

22:20.856 --> 22:22.168
I'm sorry.

22:23.272 --> 22:24.722
I'm sorry, too.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.759
Hey, man, why, huh?

22:26.897 --> 22:28.347
I mean,
where did you get it
in your head

22:28.485 --> 22:30.176
that you had to tell
a lie like that?

22:30.763 --> 22:31.936
From your father.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.214
Me?

22:35.940 --> 22:38.011
Yeah, you remember,
the Jefferson Curve
you taught me.

22:40.497 --> 22:44.501
Oh, no.
Not the Jefferson Curve again.

22:44.639 --> 22:48.228
Mmm...
Man, I've struck out on
that one about 100 times.

22:49.471 --> 22:51.300
I didn't mean no harm.
I'm sorry.

22:51.439 --> 22:54.269
You should be.
And I hope you've
learned a lesson.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.822
I sure have.

22:57.203 --> 22:59.101
Goodbye, Natalie.
Oh, no.

22:59.239 --> 23:00.620
You're not
standing me up.

23:01.863 --> 23:04.590
You mean you're still
gonna go out with me?

23:04.728 --> 23:08.179
Well, unless you were
lying about the way
you feel about me, too.

23:09.871 --> 23:11.251
No way.

23:11.942 --> 23:13.599
Well, all right!

23:17.292 --> 23:19.674
Can I pick 'em
or can I pick 'em?

23:29.235 --> 23:32.134
You know something?
I feel like I just
lost a kid brother.

23:33.791 --> 23:35.862
Well, Lionel, Jenny,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.417
we're glad you're back
together again.

23:38.555 --> 23:39.625
Oh, wait...
TOM: Hmm?

23:39.763 --> 23:40.695
Aren't we supposed
to be going with you?

23:40.833 --> 23:43.007
What? Oh, yes.

23:43.145 --> 23:45.596
Well, goodnight,
everybody.
Goodnight, Jenny.

23:45.734 --> 23:47.633
So long, Mom.
LOUISE:
So long, Lionel.

23:47.771 --> 23:49.600
Goodnight.

23:49.738 --> 23:51.291
Okay, I'll tell him.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.536
Mr. Jefferson,
that was Mister. Jacobs.

23:54.674 --> 23:55.744
Papa Panelli.

23:55.882 --> 23:57.850
And, boy, was he mad.

23:57.988 --> 24:00.646
He said he talked
to somebody at
Junior's Fish and Chips,

24:00.784 --> 24:03.303
and found out you didn't
have no account with them
like you said.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.753
Oh, no...

24:04.891 --> 24:07.446
And then he said something
in a language I don't speak.

24:07.584 --> 24:09.448
Italian.
No, dirty!

24:12.934 --> 24:15.039
Damn! Well, I guess
I lost that account.

24:15.177 --> 24:17.732
Never mind.
So you lost the account.

24:17.870 --> 24:20.355
At least you still have
your daughter-in-law.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.253
Yeah.
Nothing went right today!

24:25.049 --> 24:26.154
Oh...

24:47.106 --> 24:50.627
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
