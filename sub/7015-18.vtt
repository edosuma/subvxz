WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:06.617
Man, I am so psyched
for this auto show.

00:06.814 --> 00:08.820
I'm telling you, once I
trick out my el camino,

00:08.843 --> 00:11.675
it is going to be
bad freakin' ass.

00:13.851 --> 00:16.667
You know, "tricking out"
sounds a lot like accessorizing.

00:16.697 --> 00:18.522
Hey, don't ever call
it that, all right?

00:20.226 --> 00:21.855
But, yeah, that's
basically what it is.

00:23.165 --> 00:29.005
Kitty, I'm begging you to stop. There's
gonna be hundreds of auto parts salesmen,

00:29.069 --> 00:33.339
and now that I have the muffler shop, they're
gonna be getting in line to kiss my butt.

00:34.194 --> 00:38.804
Well, and they will be happy to kiss it
because everything from my house is spotless.

00:40.429 --> 00:42.274
All right, I'm getting in the car,

00:42.450 --> 00:45.855
I'm counting to 60, and if
you're not there, I'm leaving.

00:45.902 --> 00:48.532
Ah, the honeymoon
speech again.

00:50.839 --> 00:51.484
Whoops.

00:52.576 --> 00:54.643
I can't forget my book.
You know,

00:54.666 --> 00:58.529
this new Jackie Collins romance
really gives me a case of the tingles.

00:59.795 --> 01:01.545
Mrs. Forman, please,

01:01.580 --> 01:03.423
your tingles are
your own business.

01:04.316 --> 01:07.157
You move into my house,
you hear about my tingles.

01:11.052 --> 01:11.874
Jackie,

01:12.191 --> 01:16.359
I hope you brought a book. When we get to
the auto show, the guys are gonna ignore us.

01:16.394 --> 01:20.199
Mrs. Forman, I'm a beautiful girl
with a shrill, demanding voice.

01:20.774 --> 01:22.908
I'm pretty hard to ignore.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.335
Okay, but we can't compete
with a bunch of cars.

01:28.896 --> 01:31.710
Wheels are like
bosoms to men,

01:33.048 --> 01:35.197
and a car has four.

01:49.908 --> 01:52.515
Leo, check it out. It's my baby!

01:52.550 --> 01:53.255
Oh,

01:54.652 --> 01:55.885
this is Brooke.

01:56.631 --> 01:58.662
Oh, isn't she adorable?

01:59.719 --> 02:00.482
Yeah.

02:01.363 --> 02:03.418
I can see why you knocked her up.

02:05.414 --> 02:08.342
Michael, thanks again for watching
Betsy. Everyone else was busy.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.940
Thanks for trusting me.

02:10.562 --> 02:11.454
Yeah.

02:12.077 --> 02:15.470
It's my first time. I'm pretty
nervous. I tried on three outfits.

02:15.940 --> 02:18.756
No, you guys will be great. All
little girls love their daddies.

02:18.779 --> 02:20.963
Plus I'll bet you'll probably
like a lot of the same toys.

02:21.949 --> 02:23.018
Ooh, I'm late.

02:23.135 --> 02:24.506
Oh, yes.

02:25.058 --> 02:25.845
Hi.

02:26.150 --> 02:29.802
Ohh! Bye-bye, Betsy-pie.
Mommy loves you.

02:29.825 --> 02:32.328
- Yes, she does, yes, she does.
- All right, hand her over.

02:32.351 --> 02:34.441
- You're so attached. Just...
- oh...

02:35.815 --> 02:37.212
look, don't worry.

02:37.248 --> 02:40.627
All she does is sleep. It's like
taking care of a bowling ball.

02:41.614 --> 02:43.633
I don't like bowling, man.

02:45.042 --> 02:47.947
You throw the ball down there,
and it keeps coming back.

02:49.262 --> 02:51.152
It's spooky, man.

02:56.095 --> 02:59.701
Okay, Donna, I've just spent the last ten
minutes cologning and powdering myself.

02:59.748 --> 03:01.345
Let's spill'em and feel 'em.

03:01.427 --> 03:03.071
We can't, because Fez is here.

03:03.576 --> 03:04.278
Yeah.

03:05.006 --> 03:06.944
I'm here, and you can't.

03:08.998 --> 03:10.193
Fez, buddy, come on.

03:10.229 --> 03:13.469
You of all people should understand
how important sex is to a man.

03:14.268 --> 03:15.959
Why should you do it if I can't?

03:15.994 --> 03:17.530
Because I have a girlfriend.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.397
Why should you have a
girlfriend if I can't?

03:19.949 --> 03:21.909
Okay, how are we
gonna work this out?

03:22.015 --> 03:23.037
Give her to me.

03:25.350 --> 03:27.156
Guys, check it out.

03:27.461 --> 03:29.410
Brooke finally let
me take care of Betsy.

03:29.434 --> 03:31.160
We're gonna stay here
for the day, okay?

03:31.207 --> 03:33.849
No. Come on. Donna and I
have a do-it day planned.

03:33.883 --> 03:35.574
Yeah, and I think I got a piece of this.

03:36.478 --> 03:38.169
Look, why don't you
do it at your house?

03:38.204 --> 03:40.761
I can't. My brother's friends are
over there, and they're playing darts,

03:40.785 --> 03:43.932
and they don't use a dartboard. They just
run around and throw 'em at each other.

03:44.777 --> 03:45.728
Okay, Donna,

03:45.892 --> 03:48.307
I'm going go upstairs and
change into something sexy.

03:48.612 --> 03:52.898
Now either you come join me in 60 seconds,
or I'm gonna have to start without you, and...

03:53.215 --> 03:55.762
we both know how awkward it
is when you walk in on that.

03:58.733 --> 03:59.719
What's this?

04:00.106 --> 04:02.757
That's breast milk.
Don't touch it.

04:04.883 --> 04:05.845
Breast milk?

04:06.021 --> 04:07.254
From real breasts?

04:10.659 --> 04:11.995
What don't they do?

04:14.426 --> 04:17.209
Kelso, she's so adorable.

04:18.512 --> 04:20.531
Why is she making
that weird face?

04:23.022 --> 04:24.103
- It's poo!
- It's poo!

04:28.118 --> 04:30.619
It smells in there,
too! It's everywhere!

Shark.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.342
Shark.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.094
Oh.

05:24.501 --> 05:25.933
What do you want
me to do with it?

05:26.023 --> 05:27.321
Just chuck it.

05:27.380 --> 05:28.636
What about the shark?

05:29.610 --> 05:31.454
Chuck it. Chuck it all.

05:41.401 --> 05:44.606
Why is she still crying?
We just changed her.

05:44.893 --> 05:47.194
Maybe she doesn't like
you. Ah, baby burn.

05:49.918 --> 05:50.717
No.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.408
I know what it is.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.672
We left her teddy bear at my
house. I'll go get it. Here.

05:55.966 --> 05:56.917
Um...

05:58.878 --> 06:01.063
Aren't you gonna
take her with you?

06:01.192 --> 06:03.376
No. I can't take
Betsy in my car.

06:03.411 --> 06:06.194
I took out the seat belts
to make it go faster.

06:09.434 --> 06:11.889
Okay, don't grab those.
I'm not your mommy.

06:13.697 --> 06:16.128
Yeah, a lady once said
that to me on the bus.

06:17.901 --> 06:21.058
Well, it wasn't a lady.
It was more like a man-lady.

06:22.103 --> 06:24.170
It's hard to tell
sometimes, you know?

06:29.559 --> 06:31.141
Why tell this story, Fez?

06:33.595 --> 06:34.416
Why?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.481
Yeah, man, look at this place.

06:42.504 --> 06:45.076
Chrome, tires,
half-dressed women...

06:46.168 --> 06:48.593
it's like sunday dinner
at my grandma's house.

06:51.716 --> 06:53.254
All right, salesmen,

06:53.301 --> 06:56.835
pucker up. Red Forman's
ass is in the building.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.987
Okay, well, mine's gone. I
give yours about 30 seconds.

07:03.645 --> 07:06.251
All right, Jackie, so let's
start off looking at new tires,

07:06.298 --> 07:09.732
then after lunch, you can help me pick
out an obnoxiously loud car stereo.

07:10.002 --> 07:12.445
Wait, you're gonna spend
the day with Jackie?

07:12.491 --> 07:14.030
Yeah, man. She's my chick.

07:14.875 --> 07:18.550
All right, I'm gonna go get us a funnel cake.
But listen, this is a rough crowd, all right?

07:18.597 --> 07:21.812
So if any guys come up to you and
offer to teach you how to drive a stick,

07:22.011 --> 07:23.867
just say no and
pull the fire alarm.

07:27.060 --> 07:29.010
Told ya he wouldn't ditch me.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.160
I'm his "chick."

07:32.558 --> 07:34.495
Jackie, he's a man.

07:34.812 --> 07:37.748
Accept the fact that
he is not coming back.

07:38.710 --> 07:41.443
When I was in labor, Red
went to get me ice chips.

07:41.467 --> 07:46.410
I didn't see him for an hour and a half
because he found a pinball machine.

07:46.866 --> 07:47.935
No way.

07:47.999 --> 07:49.114
But it's fine.

07:49.474 --> 07:51.754
Ha. I laugh about it now.

07:52.787 --> 07:53.973
I do.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.063
I will.

07:57.202 --> 07:58.973
It's just not that funny.

08:02.119 --> 08:03.587
I think she's out.

08:03.975 --> 08:05.818
Well, in that case...

08:06.403 --> 08:07.189
Eric,

08:07.612 --> 08:09.526
we can't do that with her in here.

08:09.819 --> 08:12.320
What? Come on.
She's fast asleep.

08:12.555 --> 08:14.810
And it's been over a week for us.

08:15.256 --> 08:18.381
Donna, you can only keep the
tiger in its cage for so long.

08:19.038 --> 08:21.058
Yeah, that's right. I'm
callin' it a tiger now.

08:26.598 --> 08:27.995
Crap, the baby's awake.

08:28.042 --> 08:32.140
No, no, no, no, no. Hey,
Betsy. Close your eyes,

08:32.174 --> 08:35.907
'cause aunt Donna and
uncle Eric are gonna do it.

08:35.942 --> 08:39.592
Eric, you are seriously disturbed.
We have to take care of her.

08:39.629 --> 08:42.000
No, no, come on. She's fine.

08:42.047 --> 08:45.817
You can't put the tiger back in his
cage now, Donna. He's all agitated.

08:46.757 --> 08:49.586
How can a crying
baby not turn you off?

08:49.621 --> 08:52.404
Two words,
Donna... eight teen.

08:52.451 --> 08:54.482
- Nothing turns me off.
- Yeah?

09:01.280 --> 09:02.266
Hey, Fez.

09:02.912 --> 09:04.415
Why are you
staring at that milk?

09:05.131 --> 09:06.517
It's from a breast.

09:08.325 --> 09:09.535
Simply remarkable.

09:11.255 --> 09:14.613
Okay, you're clearly a demented
pervert, so let me ask you something.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.689
Would you be able to have
sex with a baby in the room?

09:17.736 --> 09:21.130
No way. I can barely do it
with a woman in the room.

09:22.334 --> 09:25.903
Congratulations, Eric. You're
more despicable sexually than Fez.

09:25.950 --> 09:28.334
Okay, Donna, here's the thing,

09:28.474 --> 09:32.206
I'm a man, so my on/off
switch is always on.

09:32.241 --> 09:34.014
Now you can either deal with that

09:34.472 --> 09:36.092
or you can switch to girls.

09:41.282 --> 09:44.111
Donna, if that's your baby,
I'm gonna snap Eric in half.

09:46.178 --> 09:48.984
Dad, don't you think you woulda
noticed if I was pregnant?

09:49.972 --> 09:52.473
Not really. I'm not
that hands-on of a dad.

09:55.056 --> 09:59.071
Anyhoo, I bought a hammock and put it up
in the den 'cause it's too cold outside.

09:59.107 --> 10:00.731
Now I need someone to push me.

10:02.575 --> 10:04.665
Sure, I'll push you
in the hammock, Bob.

10:04.899 --> 10:08.434
Then I'll climb up a tree
and pluck you a fresh coconut.

10:09.617 --> 10:10.944
I don't think so, Bob.

10:12.729 --> 10:15.512
Okay, it's your loss,
but I'm a big tipper.

10:16.932 --> 10:17.672
Okay...

10:18.077 --> 10:22.163
I got Betsy's Teddy bear. And it
wasn't easy dodging my brothers.

10:23.091 --> 10:24.935
I got a dart in the calf.

10:26.015 --> 10:26.919
Oh.

10:27.236 --> 10:29.831
Here's my little girl. Huh?

10:31.557 --> 10:33.483
Hey, baby. Look.

10:33.804 --> 10:37.244
Look, it's your Teddy bear
and your handsome daddy.

10:43.794 --> 10:46.048
Why won't she stop crying?

10:48.584 --> 10:50.205
Maybe it is me.

10:50.533 --> 10:52.177
What if she doesn't like me?

10:52.940 --> 10:54.746
Kelso, don't take it personally.

10:54.793 --> 10:56.859
I didn't like you
when I first met you.

10:58.562 --> 11:01.216
But that's because you
were peeing on my swing set.

11:01.533 --> 11:02.364
Well,

11:02.563 --> 11:05.276
it was brand-new,
and I was jealous.

11:10.334 --> 11:12.248
One funnel cake, extra sugar.

11:12.283 --> 11:13.235
Oh,

11:13.845 --> 11:18.049
Steven, I knew you'd come back,
and to show you how thankful I am,

11:18.084 --> 11:20.268
I'm gonna feed you a piece.

11:21.377 --> 11:23.420
Oh, get a room.

11:26.426 --> 11:27.987
Did you see Red?

11:28.340 --> 11:29.688
He didn't come back yet?

11:30.862 --> 11:33.375
That's weird. He was in front
of me in the funnel cake line.

11:36.322 --> 11:37.614
What the...

11:40.634 --> 11:43.851
Okay, gals, say, "funnel cake."

11:43.886 --> 11:46.645
Funnel cake.

11:46.669 --> 11:48.624
Oh, my god!

11:50.667 --> 11:52.322
There goes the fun.

11:53.555 --> 11:57.195
Well, I hope you're happy, Red Forman,
because we are leaving. You two!

11:57.225 --> 11:59.902
get your a-s-ses
back to the car.

12:00.231 --> 12:04.212
You two, get your
b-double o-bs off my husband.

12:08.238 --> 12:12.148
I can't believe that lookin' in this
mirror isn't puttin' her in a great mood.

12:13.862 --> 12:15.706
It always works for me.

12:20.115 --> 12:23.016
Man, am I glad
I found you guys.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.540
All these houses look alike.

12:27.078 --> 12:30.262
Except for that red one on the
corner where the clown lives.

12:31.448 --> 12:33.022
That's a McDonald's.

12:34.255 --> 12:37.214
Well, whatever his
name is, he's funny.

12:38.621 --> 12:40.335
Hey, what's with the baby, man?

12:40.370 --> 12:42.883
I don't know. I can't
get her to quit crying.

12:42.977 --> 12:44.409
Here, let me try.

12:46.581 --> 12:47.368
Yeah.

12:48.649 --> 12:49.353
yeah.

12:52.723 --> 12:54.226
How'd you do that?

12:54.332 --> 12:56.152
Babies love me, man,

12:56.293 --> 12:58.099
'cause I'm fuzzy.

12:59.801 --> 13:01.445
I'll go give her a bottle.

13:04.968 --> 13:06.236
That proves it.

13:06.505 --> 13:08.008
My own baby hates me.

13:08.032 --> 13:09.828
That's not true.

13:10.239 --> 13:12.963
She only stopped crying
when Leo held her because...

13:12.987 --> 13:14.607
he has the shakes.

13:16.577 --> 13:18.139
No. It's me.

13:18.890 --> 13:20.417
She hardly knows me,

13:20.452 --> 13:22.648
and a girl needs her father,
you know, for guidance.

13:22.683 --> 13:25.898
What happens if she grows up
and starts dating, like, Fez?

13:27.495 --> 13:30.536
Boy, if she looks anything like
you, she'll be way outta my league.

13:32.212 --> 13:35.394
Kelso, if you really feel like that, you
should start getting to know her now.

13:35.652 --> 13:36.956
Go hold her.

13:38.388 --> 13:39.292
You're right.

13:45.947 --> 13:46.863
Leo?

13:51.641 --> 13:53.423
Oh, my god. They're gone.

13:54.163 --> 13:56.288
Everybody... everybody
just stay calm!

13:59.895 --> 14:01.421
The breast milk is safe.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.607
Are they outside?

14:11.642 --> 14:13.474
Not in the driveway, but
Eric went to check the park.

14:13.497 --> 14:15.188
And they're not upstairs.

14:15.364 --> 14:19.319
Although I did find Kitty's special occasion
panties hanging on the towel bar.

14:21.339 --> 14:24.028
There's a lot more goin'
on up there than we think.

14:26.728 --> 14:28.584
How could I
let this happen?

14:28.894 --> 14:31.137
I am the worst father ever.

14:33.555 --> 14:34.518
Betsy?

14:36.996 --> 14:40.635
No, Michael, it's me. I'm callin'
to check in. How's she doing?

14:40.788 --> 14:43.630
How's she doing? Fine.
God, quit smothering her.

14:44.710 --> 14:47.328
Hey, put the phone to
her ear, let me say hi.

14:48.039 --> 14:50.545
It's Brooke. She wants
to talk to the baby.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.212
Gimme.

14:57.566 --> 14:59.936
<i>Hey, mama, send more milk.</i>

15:02.942 --> 15:04.727
Was that Fez?

15:06.110 --> 15:07.627
Yeah.

15:08.176 --> 15:10.736
We... we're just
messin' around.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.634
But, uh, Betsy...
she's... she's sleepin'.

15:14.681 --> 15:18.342
She'S... yeah. She's...
she's sleepin' like a little...

15:19.528 --> 15:21.548
somethin' that
sleeps a lot.

15:23.494 --> 15:25.268
Okay. Well,

15:25.302 --> 15:27.850
just give her a kiss for
me, and I'll see you later.

15:28.249 --> 15:29.083
Okay.

15:34.341 --> 15:35.316
You guys,

15:35.633 --> 15:39.860
what am I gonna do? I'm... I'm...
I'm really startin'to freak out.

15:40.212 --> 15:42.537
All right, Kelso,
just relax.

15:42.713 --> 15:45.212
She's with Leo.
He's great with kids.

15:45.247 --> 15:47.091
I'm sure he's watchin'
her like a hawk.

15:52.762 --> 15:54.171
Oh, little sweetie.

16:00.161 --> 16:02.604
What are you doin'
in my house, hippie?

16:03.449 --> 16:05.539
Are you sure
this is your house?

16:05.989 --> 16:08.643
Of course it's my house.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.968
I believe ya.

16:11.132 --> 16:13.692
The guy screaming
usually owns the house.

16:19.929 --> 16:23.193
All right, when Kitty shows up,
she's gonna be pretty mad. So

16:24.600 --> 16:26.502
I think we should
just leave her here.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.825
She can't getany madder.

16:30.940 --> 16:32.913
I think you should
definitely leave her here.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.361
Kitty.

16:35.397 --> 16:37.757
They tried to leave you!
I tried to stop 'em.

16:38.990 --> 16:41.455
Jackie, I'm perfectly fine.

16:41.666 --> 16:44.649
I just need to speak to
Red in the car for a minute.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.897
How could you, Red Forman?

16:54.015 --> 16:58.903
Steven stayed with Jackie, but you went
off and gave my funnel cake to those whores.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.210
I was just trying
to have a little fun.

17:04.644 --> 17:05.829
Oh, yeah?

17:05.863 --> 17:09.127
Well, you can take your
funand shove it up your...

17:17.736 --> 17:19.954
Michael, I just want to
talk to my daughter.

17:20.108 --> 17:22.468
I'm sorry, Brooke.
She's still asleep.

17:22.679 --> 17:23.583
Kelso,

17:23.712 --> 17:27.986
tell her the truth, or I'm gonna touch you
with Mrs. Forman's special occasion panties.

17:29.512 --> 17:31.262
Oh, those are
in my backpack.

17:34.338 --> 17:35.089
Okay...

17:37.839 --> 17:40.563
Brooke, uh...
about Betsy.

17:41.526 --> 17:43.158
There's something
I have to tell you.

17:43.405 --> 17:44.720
Anyone lose a baby?

17:44.755 --> 17:45.835
I found her!

17:47.067 --> 17:48.840
You found her?

17:48.981 --> 17:51.632
No, no, I said,
"I love her."

17:52.143 --> 17:53.746
That is not what you said.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.961
You know what? You never
listen to me. I'm hanging up.

17:59.863 --> 18:01.868
Kelso, you did say
you found her.

18:01.904 --> 18:03.559
You know, you women

18:04.088 --> 18:06.119
all stick together.

18:09.066 --> 18:10.897
Think she wants
her daddy.

18:14.602 --> 18:15.863
It's okay.

18:16.450 --> 18:17.978
Daddy's here.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.251
Do you hear that?

18:25.636 --> 18:27.268
She stopped crying.

18:29.124 --> 18:31.061
I think she knows it's me.

18:31.356 --> 18:33.328
And I think she likes me.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.779
That's so beautiful.

18:38.835 --> 18:41.295
I promised myself
I wouldn't do this.

18:46.577 --> 18:50.123
Listen, Kitty, I'm sorry
about today. It's just...

18:50.334 --> 18:53.504
they pay those ladies to
flirt with guys like me.

18:53.539 --> 18:55.066
They're almost hookers.

18:56.617 --> 18:58.261
I shoulda stayed
in the den.

18:58.366 --> 19:00.961
No, no, no. Those girls
didn't bother me.

19:00.996 --> 19:03.955
I can outlast those tramps
any day of the week.

19:04.272 --> 19:07.327
It was just... seeing
Steven and Jackie together.

19:07.362 --> 19:08.125
Oh,

19:08.677 --> 19:12.833
you can't compare our mature
relationship to what those kids have.

19:13.174 --> 19:17.161
Ah, we're past all those highs
and lows. We're like a...

19:17.501 --> 19:20.695
Like a sailboat
in a dead calm.

19:22.477 --> 19:23.712
Look, Kitty...

19:25.624 --> 19:27.292
The important thing is

19:27.714 --> 19:29.065
every morning,

19:29.534 --> 19:33.667
I get to wake up next to my
favorite girl in the whole world.

19:34.710 --> 19:37.258
Reginald Albert Forman.

19:39.348 --> 19:40.100
Whoa.

19:42.131 --> 19:43.587
Okay, how about that?

19:43.763 --> 19:44.872
On or off?

19:45.800 --> 19:47.773
Yeah, that's a showstopper.

19:48.195 --> 19:50.403
Oh, that's too bad 'cause
it really turns me on.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.469
No, get... god,
get off of me.

19:54.553 --> 19:55.997
Who loves you?

19:56.725 --> 19:59.132
Your daddy does,
that's who.

19:59.731 --> 20:02.983
Well, I can't remember the last time
you made that much of a fuss over me.

20:05.450 --> 20:06.283
Ohh.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.843
There's my baby girl.

20:08.913 --> 20:10.839
Mommy missed you.

20:11.121 --> 20:13.011
Yeah, I don't want
to let her go.

20:13.763 --> 20:16.168
She's so beautiful
and warm.

20:16.473 --> 20:18.821
Well, apparently
I'm ugly and cold.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.867
- Oh, here. Look at her smiling.
- There we go.

20:24.902 --> 20:27.931
Oh, I'm so happy
she loves her daddy.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.951
- Yeah.
- Yes, It is.

20:32.478 --> 20:33.206
Hey,

20:33.711 --> 20:34.897
listen, uh...

20:35.742 --> 20:38.713
I know I haven't
been around much, but, uh...

20:40.510 --> 20:43.363
That's gonna change'cause
she's my girl, and

20:44.033 --> 20:45.324
I wanna know her.

20:46.405 --> 20:47.872
That would be awesome.

20:48.624 --> 20:49.904
- Um...
- I got it.

20:49.927 --> 20:51.665
Grab her stuff, and I'll
go put her in the car.

20:51.712 --> 20:53.624
Yeah, here.

20:54.410 --> 20:55.126
Thanks.

21:13.782 --> 21:15.614
You need help, man.

21:18.373 --> 21:19.477
Yes, I do.

21:34.970 --> 21:36.555
I hate myself.

21:38.704 --> 21:40.888
But the money's
just so good.

21:43.354 --> 21:45.984
A little faster so
it stirs my drink.
