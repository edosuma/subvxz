02:17.857 --> 02:20.488
All is here for the vacancy
to the quality department.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.592
Have you worked somewhere earlier?

02:37.078 --> 02:38.158
Do you want to hear a joke?

02:39.442 --> 02:41.349
Once a man was
drowning in the river.

02:42.188 --> 02:46.418
He yelled,

02:46.497 --> 02:47.990
Lord Ganesha started dancing.

02:51.085 --> 02:55.707
So, Lord Ganesha said, "'Didn"t you
dance while immersing me in water?"'

02:58.940 --> 03:02.649
Actually, l shouldn"t be cracking
jokes about God in front of God.

03:02.728 --> 03:05.572
l"m sorry.
Don"t mind, but l have no mind.

03:05.648 --> 03:07.271
Give my ball.

03:08.916 --> 03:11.938
Hurry up! Quick.

03:12.008 --> 03:13.667
Kids, are you okay?

03:24.973 --> 03:26.252
Hey, mister!

03:26.328 --> 03:28.058
Hello. Yes, you.

03:28.796 --> 03:30.436
Aren"t there enough
potholes in the city..

03:30.509 --> 03:31.829
..that you"ve dug up another one?

03:31.853 --> 03:33.188
And for the past two weeks.

03:34.461 --> 03:37.056
Those kids and my
God were saved today.

03:37.902 --> 03:40.082
Why are you so irresponsible?

03:40.161 --> 03:41.921
The next time,
someone might lose his life...

03:41.945 --> 03:43.403
...because of these potholes.

03:44.436 --> 03:46.238
But whether someone lives or dies...

03:46.314 --> 03:47.901
...it doesn"t matter to you.

03:47.982 --> 03:49.191
Don"t worry, madam.

03:49.616 --> 03:52.186
You"ll have no complaints
against us henceforth.

03:52.257 --> 03:53.257
Okay.

03:53.578 --> 03:54.645
Let"s see.

03:56.810 --> 03:57.841
Hi!

03:58.896 --> 04:01.290
l just wanted to send
this message across that...

04:01.746 --> 04:03.132
...l"m proud of you.

04:04.075 --> 04:09.740
l"m sure that whatever you
do in life will be right for you.

04:11.165 --> 04:13.107
No matter how many
obstacles you face...

04:14.154 --> 04:15.920
...there won"t be darkness anymore.

04:35.773 --> 04:36.282
Hello.

04:36.364 --> 04:38.804
Do you want to listen to the
bad news first or the worst news?

04:39.492 --> 04:41.044
The bad news is that you"ll
have to live without me every day...

04:41.125 --> 04:42.961
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.081
And the worst news
is that l won"t be able...

04:45.157 --> 04:47.136
...to live without you
every day between 9 to 5.

04:48.494 --> 04:49.808
l got the job, Aisha.

04:50.788 --> 04:51.818
l got the job.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.749
Now go and erase that
wish from your diary.

04:56.801 --> 04:57.903
l"ve become independent.

04:58.678 --> 04:59.678
Guru...

05:01.076 --> 05:02.916
...there"s something
that l have to say to you.

05:03.856 --> 05:04.856
Tell me.

05:05.595 --> 05:07.182
No, come home first.

05:07.263 --> 05:09.277
Tell me. l"m on my way home.

05:09.348 --> 05:10.770
No, come home.

05:12.998 --> 05:13.998
Hello.

05:15.570 --> 05:16.570
How did you get in?

05:16.995 --> 05:17.995
Aisha?

05:18.594 --> 05:19.594
What are you doing?

05:19.879 --> 05:20.151
Who is..

05:20.227 --> 05:23.187
Does anyone barge into someone"s house
like that without ringing the bell!

05:23.211 --> 05:24.562
Get out of here. Get out!

05:27.422 --> 05:28.915
Aisha, who is it? What happened?

05:29.611 --> 05:30.891
Aisha!

05:31.384 --> 05:32.415
Aisha, who is it?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.201
Aisha, listen to me! Police!

05:35.764 --> 05:37.873
Aisha! Listen! Hey! - Guru!

05:38.231 --> 05:40.802
Listen, you"ve enmity with me.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.610
Look.. spare her.

05:43.688 --> 05:48.239
You have a problem with me.
Listen. Spare her.

05:48.310 --> 05:50.775
Guru!
- Hey, stop. Let my Aisha go!

05:54.010 --> 05:57.198
Please! No!

06:06.767 --> 06:08.425
Please don"t kill me.

06:14.344 --> 06:17.745
Please don"t kill me. Please.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.086
Who is in charge of this area?

07:49.439 --> 07:51.026
l am. lnspector Waghle.

07:51.976 --> 07:53.599
Aditya Rathore, CBl.

07:54.408 --> 07:57.916
But why is the CBl so keen
on the murder of an ordinary girl?

07:58.927 --> 08:03.371
l am keen not on this girl,
but her love.

08:04.071 --> 08:05.315
l didn"t get you.

08:05.844 --> 08:09.280
We "ll have to find Aisha" s
murderer at the earliest.

08:10.015 --> 08:11.638
lf he sets out to look for him...

08:12.448 --> 08:14.948
...then the government will
have to find some new property.

08:17.209 --> 08:18.311
Guru will kill so many...

08:18.391 --> 08:21.164
...that there won"t be enough
place to cremate the bodies.

08:28.992 --> 08:32.807
"Devil. Monster. Demon. Beast."

08:33.371 --> 08:35.905
"Who says that only
God has several names?"

08:38.410 --> 08:40.461
"Demons are found in hell."

08:41.573 --> 08:45.117
"But l met one such demon
in the so-called paradise in Goa."

08:48.803 --> 08:50.853
"But demons possess
a special quality."

08:51.967 --> 08:54.502
"lt"s his habit to be
present at his own funeral."

08:55.233 --> 08:56.785
"Hatred is his weapon."

08:57.875 --> 08:59.463
"Anger is his explosive."

08:59.926 --> 09:01.798
"He doesn"t know
what sympathy means."

09:02.394 --> 09:03.922
"No one loves him."

09:04.930 --> 09:06.945
"Every love story has a hero..."

09:07.607 --> 09:08.607
"...a heroine..."

09:08.858 --> 09:09.925
"...and a villain."

09:14.246 --> 09:17.433
"But this love story
is of a villain."

09:21.579 --> 09:23.238
Please forgive me, Guru.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.981
l made a mistake, Guru.

09:26.827 --> 09:27.827
What are you doing?

09:28.461 --> 09:29.954
Guru, please forgive me.

09:30.025 --> 09:33.532
l beg of you, Guru! Please spare me.

09:33.605 --> 09:35.925
l beg of you. Don"t do this!
For God"s sake, spare me life.

09:37.846 --> 09:39.232
Are you praying?

09:39.931 --> 09:40.831
Guru, please forgive me.

09:40.904 --> 09:43.369
Do you really think that
He will appear to save you?

09:49.628 --> 09:50.628
Fine.

09:53.625 --> 09:54.625
Pray.

09:54.946 --> 09:56.747
No! Guru.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.742
You have time until
this matchstick is put out.

10:02.801 --> 10:04.009
Remember your God.

10:04.086 --> 10:04.536
Rohan

10:04.886 --> 10:07.457
What are you doing? What happened?

10:07.528 --> 10:09.080
What are you doing, son?

10:09.509 --> 10:10.409
Rohan.

10:10.482 --> 10:12.177
Rohan.

10:12.255 --> 10:15.313
Mother, l"ll kill him!
- Don"t do this!

10:15.383 --> 10:17.493
Please stop.

10:17.573 --> 10:20.073
CBl People beat me up a lot.

10:20.701 --> 10:22.881
Raghu. Please save me, o God.

10:23.829 --> 10:24.836
Rahul! Rahul, no.

10:24.906 --> 10:25.735
Help.

10:25.810 --> 10:26.930
Can l give you a suggestion?

10:28.208 --> 10:29.239
Don"t pray to God.

10:30.328 --> 10:31.328
Pray to the breeze.

10:32.483 --> 10:35.635
Because if there"s breeze,
you"ll be finished.

10:35.716 --> 10:40.361
No, no! Guru, please...
l made a mistake.

10:40.443 --> 10:42.030
No, no! Guru, what are you doing?

10:42.390 --> 10:44.676
Guru, please don"t do this!
l beg of you!

10:44.752 --> 10:46.897
No, Guru! Guru...

10:49.689 --> 10:52.283
No, Rohan.
- No, leave me.

10:52.365 --> 10:53.917
Guru!

10:53.998 --> 10:56.214
Spare me, Guru.

10:56.292 --> 10:59.349
Guru! Guru! No.

10:59.420 --> 11:00.699
Guru! Spare me, Guru.

11:00.776 --> 11:02.921
Spare me. Guru.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.251
Let go of me!
- Let go off.

11:05.642 --> 11:07.786
Guru, no.

11:07.866 --> 11:10.224
Let go of me! Guru, let go of me!

11:10.299 --> 11:11.851
Please let go of me!

11:11.932 --> 11:14.361
Fine. l"ll let go of you!

11:18.363 --> 11:20.021
Brother.

11:20.726 --> 11:24.791
No! No!

11:32.404 --> 11:35.911
No!

11:35.984 --> 11:37.999
No!

11:46.099 --> 11:48.694
Come out.

11:49.157 --> 11:51.752
Come on! Take him out.

11:51.833 --> 11:53.907
Will you kill him? Leave.

11:54.371 --> 11:56.350
Come on.

12:07.892 --> 12:11.079
Tell me! Who is your boss!

12:11.158 --> 12:13.303
Who do you work for!

12:13.382 --> 12:15.492
Has Singh sir sent you?

12:15.573 --> 12:18.725
Torture him.
Tell me about his business.

12:18.805 --> 12:21.720
Hold him tight.
All of you will be punished.

12:22.454 --> 12:24.149
Hey, tell me.

12:24.505 --> 12:26.828
Come on.

12:37.330 --> 12:40.802
Ready, steady, smile!

12:40.876 --> 12:43.163
Okay. A joke.

12:43.239 --> 12:45.774
A woman went to the police
station and asked the inspector...

12:45.846 --> 12:48.939
"'lnspector,
my husband had gone to the market..."'

12:49.008 --> 12:50.288
"'...to buy okra two days ago."'

12:50.312 --> 12:51.709
"'He hasn"t come back yet."'

12:51.790 --> 12:54.847
The inspector said,
"'What"s the big deal, madam?"'

12:54.918 --> 12:57.453
"'Cook some other vegetable."'

12:59.157 --> 13:02.523
Wonderful! - Thank you.

13:05.171 --> 13:06.593
Hey, come on.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.881
What is the press doing outside?

13:09.620 --> 13:12.014
So that your photos are
published in the newspaper...

13:12.088 --> 13:15.145
...and people come to know
that you are the officer...

13:15.216 --> 13:18.960
...who forbade an adult girl from
getting married against her will.

13:19.039 --> 13:21.759
You"re interfering in other people"s
lives! Don"t you have any shame?

13:21.783 --> 13:23.098
Sheela is an adult.

13:23.522 --> 13:25.358
And she came to me for help.

13:26.129 --> 13:28.416
All of you treat her like a maid...

13:28.493 --> 13:30.151
...who is only supposed
to do the household chores...

13:30.230 --> 13:31.581
...and look after children.

13:31.655 --> 13:33.492
When she demands to be happy...

13:33.567 --> 13:35.439
...all of you have a problem with it.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.457
While trying to belong
to a particular religion...

13:38.954 --> 13:40.594
...you have forgotten
to be a human being.

13:40.901 --> 13:43.295
Get aside. Move.. move.

13:43.369 --> 13:44.369
Out. out from here.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.975
Sharad, drive her out.

14:03.979 --> 14:07.653
Because of your boss Caesar,
three officers of mine were killed.

14:08.254 --> 14:12.141
The officers that
were doing their duty.

14:16.978 --> 14:18.744
But l give you a chance.

14:19.064 --> 14:21.836
l will make you my pet dog.

14:22.748 --> 14:25.865
l will ask Deepu"s
mother to testify...

14:25.946 --> 14:30.663
...that her son accidentally
fell in the fire in a drunken state.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.094
And being my pet dog...

14:34.114 --> 14:38.308
...you will wag your tail
and take me to your boss Caesar.

14:40.614 --> 14:42.308
lt"s your decision now.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.678
You changed sides, didn"t you?

14:46.696 --> 14:49.196
She didn"t testify against me.

14:50.032 --> 14:52.461
That"s the reason
why you"re barking!

14:53.786 --> 14:55.101
Will you speak up?

14:56.115 --> 14:59.586
l will avenge Caesar for
killing my men at any cost.

15:00.772 --> 15:03.474
l will make your condition
so miserable in prison...

15:04.178 --> 15:06.193
...that you"ll yearn for death.

15:06.264 --> 15:08.622
People fear death.

15:09.531 --> 15:12.269
But l face death each day.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.299
As an uninvited guest.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.628
Acting over smart.

15:21.730 --> 15:24.195
You"ll pay the price
for this insanity, Guru.

15:25.241 --> 15:27.220
This is not insanity. lt"s manhood.

15:32.645 --> 15:35.240
Lawyer, give the bail paper quickly.

15:48.042 --> 15:49.108
Arjun.

15:49.189 --> 15:50.189
ls everything alright?

15:54.368 --> 15:55.541
Hey, listen!

15:55.619 --> 15:58.154
Hey! Do you want to hear a joke?

15:58.225 --> 16:00.654
Once a thief got
into a house to steal.

16:01.389 --> 16:04.268
The safe read, "'There is
no need to break open this safe."'

16:04.343 --> 16:06.357
"'Press 1,2,3 and then the red button."'

16:06.428 --> 16:07.743
"'The safe will open."'

16:08.444 --> 16:10.084
As soon as the thief
pressed the button...

16:10.108 --> 16:12.118
...the alarm rang and
the police came there.

16:12.198 --> 16:14.900
While leaving,
the thief told the owner...

16:14.978 --> 16:17.407
"'l have lost faith
in humanity today."'

16:20.122 --> 16:21.436
Hey!

16:22.555 --> 16:24.629
The joke was not that bad.

16:25.127 --> 16:26.514
You could have at least smiled.

16:27.352 --> 16:29.888
Listen. l need you
to do something for me.

16:29.958 --> 16:31.118
You don"t have to rob a safe.

16:32.044 --> 16:33.986
Someone needs to be kidnapped.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.059
Will you do it?

16:36.180 --> 16:38.609
l"m not asking you
to do it for free.

16:38.682 --> 16:39.749
l"ll pay you.

16:39.829 --> 16:41.216
Show me your rate card.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.984
l would have done it myself.

16:43.271 --> 16:45.380
But just as we go
to a saloon to shave...

16:45.460 --> 16:47.220
...and to a tailor
to get clothes stitched...

16:47.232 --> 16:49.632
...similarly, won"t we go
to a goon to get someone kidnapped?

16:50.292 --> 16:53.657
Because you look like a villain.

17:01.031 --> 17:02.204
Hey, villain!

17:04.681 --> 17:06.031
Smile!

17:09.373 --> 17:12.560
Come on.

17:13.647 --> 17:15.377
Sahiba! Guru!

17:15.454 --> 17:17.114
Wait. wait.

17:20.425 --> 17:22.049
Pass the ball. Quick.

17:22.406 --> 17:24.588
l sent you there to kill.

17:25.708 --> 17:26.881
Not to get killed.

17:31.408 --> 17:36.480
l know that you"re
not too fond of living.

17:36.553 --> 17:41.175
But your life is priceless for me.
Priceless.

17:43.921 --> 17:45.793
God blessed me with you.

17:46.494 --> 17:47.986
You"re my son.

17:48.057 --> 17:50.652
You mean more than a son to me.

17:51.603 --> 17:55.241
Stop looking for excuses to die.

17:55.322 --> 17:57.194
Look for a reason to live.

17:57.268 --> 17:58.796
Caesar.

17:58.867 --> 18:00.419
Caesar.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.479
Caesar.

18:02.551 --> 18:03.551
l know him.

18:04.010 --> 18:05.010
You"re too much.

18:05.367 --> 18:05.781
Don"t you understand?

18:05.853 --> 18:06.433
Hey!

18:06.514 --> 18:07.378
How many times do l tell you?

18:07.452 --> 18:08.317
Hey, villain!

18:08.391 --> 18:09.255
Madam, you can"t go in.

18:09.329 --> 18:10.988
l know him. Let me go.

18:11.761 --> 18:12.792
Hey, villain!

18:13.743 --> 18:16.765
Yes! See, l told you l know him.

18:16.836 --> 18:17.251
Hi!

18:17.601 --> 18:19.224
As all of you already know...

18:19.304 --> 18:22.906
...Mr. Caesar has done
a lot for the people.

18:22.989 --> 18:24.232
Villain!

18:24.518 --> 18:27.089
l"ll scream even louder
if you don"t come here.

18:27.472 --> 18:29.617
Hey! Come here!

18:29.696 --> 18:31.568
Yes. See, he"s coming.

18:32.407 --> 18:33.509
l told you...

18:33.589 --> 18:36.919
Let go of my hand!
Why are you holding my hand?

18:37.829 --> 18:40.981
You have no idea
what l can do to you.

18:42.591 --> 18:45.161
lt won"t take me too
long to dispose your body.

18:45.858 --> 18:49.117
Stop following me and leave.

18:57.258 --> 18:58.716
Wow!

19:00.526 --> 19:03.405
This is why l want to hire you.

19:05.079 --> 19:08.586
l know you"re not the romantic kind.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.395
You"re the kind that
would shoot someone on sight.

19:11.752 --> 19:12.960
Get lost!

19:15.993 --> 19:18.244
l"m sorry. Cool it.

19:19.329 --> 19:20.786
Listen. You"ll kill me...

19:21.136 --> 19:23.136
...and unnecessarily and
go to prison free of cost.

19:23.256 --> 19:25.216
The way l"m paying you,
if someone had paid you...

19:25.240 --> 19:26.795
...to kill me, then it was worth it.

19:26.872 --> 19:29.017
But who would pay to kill me?
l"m so cute.

19:29.096 --> 19:30.826
Do you suffer from
a talking disorder?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.953
l suffer from a lot of disorders.
Forget about that.

19:33.023 --> 19:35.796
Tell me. Will you do it for me?

19:36.465 --> 19:37.744
Please say yes.

19:38.342 --> 19:40.249
Never refuse money.

19:47.899 --> 19:50.707
We"re going on such
an important mission...

19:50.784 --> 19:53.415
...but we don"t even
know each other"s names.

19:53.495 --> 19:54.495
l"m Aisha.

19:56.519 --> 19:57.519
Guru.

19:59.613 --> 20:01.627
Why are you so rude?

20:02.741 --> 20:03.878
just as it"s compulsory
for Superman to wear...

20:03.957 --> 20:05.485
...red underwear over his costume...

20:05.556 --> 20:08.056
...is it compulsory
for gangsters to be rude?

20:08.371 --> 20:10.278
You don"t laugh or smile.

20:10.352 --> 20:12.118
You don"t even shave or bathe.

20:13.654 --> 20:15.206
l know what you are.

20:16.052 --> 20:17.296
Angry bird.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.667
The game is inspired by you. Yes.

20:24.255 --> 20:25.807
Like this..

20:25.889 --> 20:28.170
Are you crazy or the one
who has to be kidnapped is crazy?

20:28.194 --> 20:29.545
l"m not crazy.

20:29.851 --> 20:32.386
lt "s Chhotu who" s crazy,
just like a depressed lover.

20:32.457 --> 20:35.159
That"s why his family
got him admitted here.

20:35.239 --> 20:37.348
They left him alone
and are settled in America.

20:37.428 --> 20:38.908
Do you know what
they told the doctor?

20:38.932 --> 20:40.034
That he"s insane.

20:40.313 --> 20:42.943
lf l don"t help him,
then he"ll really go insane.

20:43.997 --> 20:44.997
That"s why...

20:46.118 --> 20:47.125
We"ll have to save him.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.140
These are coins.
- Yes.

20:55.953 --> 20:57.033
Do you want to hear a joke?

20:57.100 --> 20:58.780
Let it be.
- Once... - l"ll take the coins.

21:00.368 --> 21:03.626
By the way,
you"ll have to fight a few people.

21:04.469 --> 21:05.961
You might get hurt.

21:07.597 --> 21:09.706
lf it was dancing,
l would have gone to a dancer.

21:10.065 --> 21:12.802
But it"s action.
That"s why l had to come to you.

21:13.158 --> 21:16.038
Because you are.. a villain!

21:18.372 --> 21:21.286
Hey! Stop!

21:21.360 --> 21:21.668
l"m stuck up here.

21:21.986 --> 21:25.079
Each day should be like that.
This is fun.

21:25.358 --> 21:27.788
Sometimes the players win,
and sometimes they lose.

21:28.381 --> 21:30.846
But the dealer is always profiting.

21:49.167 --> 21:50.754
Who are you?

21:55.423 --> 21:57.709
l"m your father by relation.

21:59.872 --> 22:01.151
My name is Shehanshah.

22:01.227 --> 22:03.301
Shehanshah.

22:13.045 --> 22:14.045
Where"s Chhotu?

22:14.852 --> 22:16.096
Where"s Chhotu?

22:22.984 --> 22:24.442
Chhotu, come with me.

22:25.835 --> 22:27.601
Come on, Chhotu.

22:28.685 --> 22:33.094
Chhotu!
- Aisha! Aisha! Aisha!

22:34.003 --> 22:35.425
You"re getting married, Chhotu!

22:35.497 --> 22:37.025
Really?
- Yes!

22:37.061 --> 22:39.313
Chhotu is going to get married.

22:39.425 --> 22:41.499
Chhotu is going to get married.

22:42.414 --> 22:46.514
"'My life is in search
of its destination."'

22:46.584 --> 22:50.471
"'ls this my destination?"'

22:50.791 --> 22:58.791
"'Why does my heart
say that l must halt here?"'

22:58.924 --> 23:02.953
"'l have found new emotions."'

23:03.025 --> 23:06.734
"'What kind of an effect is this?"'

23:07.230 --> 23:11.330
"'l"ve found hope again."'

23:11.401 --> 23:15.181
"'Someone has accepted it."'

23:16.580 --> 23:18.310
Where are you going, son?

23:18.388 --> 23:20.259
Stay till the wedding.

23:20.716 --> 23:22.967
l didn"t even get
the chance to thank you.

23:27.007 --> 23:31.830
"'Like the poem of a poet..."'

23:31.908 --> 23:36.032
"'...that calms one"s mind."'

23:36.114 --> 23:40.143
"'l"ve found someone..."'

23:40.215 --> 23:43.817
"'...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."'

23:44.385 --> 23:48.308
"'Like the arrival of a new season."'

23:48.382 --> 23:52.127
"'Or afternoons in winter."'

23:52.657 --> 23:56.757
"'l"ve found someone..."'

23:56.828 --> 24:00.371
"'...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."'

24:17.127 --> 24:18.265
Sorry.

24:21.506 --> 24:23.236
Did she kidnap all of them?

24:23.939 --> 24:24.732
No.

24:24.808 --> 24:25.946
"Blessing your name."

24:26.024 --> 24:27.184
ln fact, she has helped them.

24:27.380 --> 24:28.447
"Where the.."

24:28.527 --> 24:30.992
Being her father,
l couldn"t get her married.

24:31.273 --> 24:32.931
But just wait and watch.

24:33.289 --> 24:35.919
She will get all
of them married today.

24:54.595 --> 24:57.747
"'just as a shore..."'

24:58.800 --> 25:01.988
"'...helps a person relax."'

25:02.068 --> 25:08.526
"'l"ve found her at
a juncture in life."'

25:11.278 --> 25:14.466
"'just as a star in the sky..."'

25:14.997 --> 25:18.398
"'...spreads light."'

25:18.473 --> 25:25.003
"'She spreads light in the city."'

25:27.127 --> 25:30.978
"'l"ve forgotten my sorrow."'

25:31.054 --> 25:34.764
"'What kind of an effect is this?"'

25:35.503 --> 25:42.305
"'She is teaching me to live again."'

25:43.915 --> 25:48.288
"'just as the rains spread joy..."'

25:48.364 --> 25:52.179
"'...or an ointment soothes the pain."'

25:52.813 --> 25:56.628
"'l"ve found someone..."'

25:56.705 --> 26:00.343
"'...just as a wanderer

"'l"ve found someone..."'

26:13.284 --> 26:16.886
"'...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."' - Smile.

26:27.708 --> 26:28.608
Mister!

26:28.681 --> 26:29.711
Yes, madam.

26:29.794 --> 26:30.860
The wedding is today.

26:31.741 --> 26:32.570
Please hurry up.

26:32.644 --> 26:33.644
Yes, l"m doing it.

26:50.231 --> 26:51.475
Ouch!

26:54.645 --> 26:57.559
"'The smiling face..."'

26:58.781 --> 27:01.898
"'...acts as a shield."'

27:01.979 --> 27:08.189
"'l wonder what"s
hidden in the heart."'

27:11.294 --> 27:18.488
"'She shadows the others..."'

27:18.558 --> 27:25.396
"'...while she stands under the sun."'

27:27.282 --> 27:29.913
"'She is hurt..."'

27:29.993 --> 27:34.994
"'...but why do l feel the pain?"'

27:35.415 --> 27:42.501
"'What does my heart intend to do?"'

27:44.452 --> 27:47.889
"'l was like a restless bird."'

27:48.553 --> 27:52.677
"'l was wandering."'

27:52.758 --> 27:56.752
"'l"ve found someone..."'

27:56.825 --> 28:00.297
"'...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."'

28:00.927 --> 28:05.051
"'Like the arrival of a new season."'

28:05.132 --> 28:08.734
"'Or afternoons in winter."'

28:09.303 --> 28:13.048
"'l"ve found someone..."'

28:13.404 --> 28:17.184
"'...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."'

28:17.263 --> 28:21.327
"'just as a wanderer finds shelter."'

28:21.399 --> 28:25.523
"'just as a wanderer finds shelter."'

28:25.604 --> 28:29.527
"'just as a wanderer finds shelter."'

28:30.400 --> 28:33.493
Uniting two lovers.

28:33.633 --> 28:34.913
Aren"t there any wishes for her?

28:35.336 --> 28:37.517
There are. Of course.

28:37.595 --> 28:39.431
But all her wishes are really weird.

28:39.924 --> 28:42.981
Seeing a peacock dancing
in the first rain.

28:43.052 --> 28:45.268
To fly like a wind.

28:45.346 --> 28:46.839
Flying like the wind.

28:48.022 --> 28:51.908
Catching a butterfly
and playing with it.

28:51.984 --> 28:54.378
Touching the snow.

28:54.452 --> 28:58.410
Being famous for a day so
that people know who this girl is.

28:58.484 --> 29:02.064
Seeing the world under the sea.

29:02.133 --> 29:04.420
lt gets serious now.

29:04.775 --> 29:09.077
And that is, to save someone"s life.

29:09.919 --> 29:11.341
Saving someone"s life.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.116
Guru, saving someone"s life.

29:33.241 --> 29:34.935
Uncle, carefully.

29:35.952 --> 29:39.104
We"re going to the graveyard.

29:57.293 --> 30:01.251
She directly went to
the hospital from church.

30:23.882 --> 30:25.055
Thank you, Guru.

30:25.758 --> 30:27.832
For the coins that l gave you...

30:27.914 --> 30:30.865
...you did much more for
Sheela and Chhotu than that.

30:31.390 --> 30:33.297
No matter how you look...

30:33.371 --> 30:36.558
...you"re not such a bad villain
as you try to show the world.

30:37.124 --> 30:38.403
You have some good qualities.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.831
Much more than the bad qualities.

30:39.905 --> 30:42.299
l "m not good! l" m very bad!

30:42.929 --> 30:44.129
What do you think of yourself?

30:44.458 --> 30:47.231
Do you think we live to fulfill
your wishes in your diary? - No.

30:47.308 --> 30:48.208
You click everyone"s pictures...

30:48.281 --> 30:49.921
...to show that you"re
a very nice person?

30:49.945 --> 30:50.296
No.

30:50.367 --> 30:52.487
What do you try to prove
by cracking jokes every time?

30:53.565 --> 30:55.544
Look at that. Look at death.

30:56.484 --> 30:57.684
Do you want to make fun of it?

30:58.604 --> 31:00.299
Crack a joke on it! Come on!

31:05.869 --> 31:08.535
Life is playing the
biggest prank on me.

31:10.248 --> 31:13.127
The biggest joke is that
death is laughing at me.

31:14.801 --> 31:15.801
Yes, Guru.

31:17.825 --> 31:19.033
l"m going to die.

31:21.127 --> 31:26.365
These wishes that l want
to fulfill are my last wishes.

31:27.452 --> 31:31.931
l don "t even know if l" ll be able
to fulfill all of them before dying.

31:33.640 --> 31:34.640
l just...

31:36.768 --> 31:40.832
...want to live my life
like such a party that...

31:41.807 --> 31:43.122
...when death arrives...

31:43.510 --> 31:48.298
...l want to sit and have a couple
of drinks with it before leaving.

32:04.816 --> 32:06.216
lt was very unfortunate, wasn"t it?

32:09.056 --> 32:10.964
But if you befriend the devil...

32:11.490 --> 32:14.298
...it"s bound to knock
on your door someday.

32:16.217 --> 32:18.196
Your Caesar killed your Aisha.

32:19.309 --> 32:20.411
But what will you do now?

32:20.770 --> 32:22.049
How will you kill Caesar?

32:22.785 --> 32:24.800
No. Let it be.
You won"t be able to do it.

32:25.531 --> 32:27.747
The one who taught you to shoot...

32:28.347 --> 32:29.347
You will never kill him.

32:30.050 --> 32:32.479
Let me do a favour on you.

32:33.351 --> 32:34.844
l"ll kill him.

32:35.332 --> 32:36.576
l"ll take your revenge.

32:37.175 --> 32:38.313
l"ll find him.

32:40.477 --> 32:41.650
No matter where he is.

33:10.820 --> 33:11.820
Where were you?

33:12.592 --> 33:13.835
l called you so many times.

33:14.191 --> 33:15.221
l even left a message.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.142
Who were you having fun with?

33:18.015 --> 33:19.015
Tell me.

33:26.113 --> 33:27.321
lt was dead.

33:28.372 --> 33:29.580
My phone"s battery.

33:29.657 --> 33:31.707
Your phone"s battery was dead.

33:31.778 --> 33:33.306
But you were alive, weren"t you?

33:33.377 --> 33:35.097
You could have called
from a public phone...

33:35.121 --> 33:36.521
...and informed that you"d be late.

33:37.061 --> 33:39.455
But no. You will never change.

33:39.842 --> 33:41.522
lt"s no use telling you anything.
- Listen.

33:41.579 --> 33:44.246
Look,
l"ve brought a chain for you.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.298
lt"ll look pretty on you.

33:55.517 --> 33:58.360
Look at this. You brought
bangles for me last week.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.929
They"ve turned black
in just one week.

34:02.851 --> 34:05.031
l had gone to aunt Madhvi"s
house for a wedding.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.360
l was flaunting these to everyone
saying that these are gold bangles.

34:09.835 --> 34:11.981
But then l realised that
it"s not gold, but brass.

34:12.514 --> 34:14.527
lt"s brass coated with fake gold!

34:15.293 --> 34:16.293
Here are your bangles.

34:18.178 --> 34:19.280
You wear these bangles!

34:19.880 --> 34:22.132
You and those bangles,
both are a fake!

34:23.253 --> 34:25.327
l just don"t want to talk to you.

34:25.686 --> 34:27.309
You will not stay
in this house today.

34:27.389 --> 34:28.527
Get out of my house!

34:28.605 --> 34:29.612
just get out!

34:29.683 --> 34:31.554
Listen to me...
- l said get out!

34:31.629 --> 34:32.944
Sulu!

34:33.020 --> 34:37.014
l really don"t know how he was born.

34:38.859 --> 34:43.505
Get out of my house.
- Sulu, listen to me.

34:44.385 --> 34:45.629
Take this. come on.

34:45.706 --> 34:47.128
Listen to me... - Get out!

34:47.201 --> 34:47.650
Sulu.

34:47.722 --> 34:48.728
Get out of here!

34:49.007 --> 34:50.217
Listen to me.

35:01.139 --> 35:02.139
Father.

35:12.643 --> 35:13.643
Take this.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.511
Don"t feel bad about
what your mother said.

35:22.722 --> 35:24.665
She loves your father a lot.

35:25.085 --> 35:30.501
To be honest, men like you are giving
the men of lndia a tough time.

35:30.577 --> 35:33.077
lf there are any more men like you...

35:33.601 --> 35:36.588
...then men will lose our manhood.

35:39.649 --> 35:40.964
Take this.

35:44.202 --> 35:46.702
Darling. Come here.

35:48.338 --> 35:49.652
Where"s the ice!

35:50.701 --> 35:51.731
l forgot to get it.

35:51.814 --> 35:53.022
Get it now!

35:58.418 --> 36:01.783
Look, Rakesh,
we are middleclass people.

36:02.971 --> 36:06.716
We"re sandwiched between
the upper-class and the lower-class.

36:07.420 --> 36:08.593
The police torture us.

36:09.227 --> 36:10.922
The ministers torture us.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.695
The people torture us too.

36:12.772 --> 36:15.829
Our lives are too stressed.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.874
How do we get rid of it?

36:18.611 --> 36:22.427
That"s why men like us
come home and beat our wives.

36:23.269 --> 36:26.634
There"s no other way to vent
out our frustration, my brother.

36:27.892 --> 36:30.665
l have another solution
to your problem.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.573
Come to Mira Road with me.

36:32.653 --> 36:36.090
There are beautiful dancers
in the dance bars over there.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.243
Be an animal!

36:38.597 --> 36:41.132
Bring out the beast in you!

36:41.481 --> 36:42.725
Hunt!

37:04.213 --> 37:05.279
"Hi!"

37:06.020 --> 37:08.378
"l just wanted to send
this message across that..."

37:08.453 --> 37:09.840
"...l"m proud of you."

37:11.650 --> 37:13.238
"l"m confident that.."

37:14.292 --> 37:16.436
"..now you"ll do.."

37:17.838 --> 37:19.259
"..everything right in life."

37:20.340 --> 37:21.927
"No matter how many
hardships you face."

37:22.529 --> 37:24.081
"Now there"ll be no darkness."

37:28.716 --> 37:33.432
"'Why am l lonely?"'

37:33.791 --> 37:38.305
"'Why am l living in pieces?"'

37:43.801 --> 37:48.696
"'Why am l lonely?"'

37:48.771 --> 37:53.523
"'Why am l living in pieces?"'

37:53.880 --> 38:01.347
"'Why is my soul enduring this?"'

38:03.403 --> 38:08.605
"'l"m incomplete."'

38:08.686 --> 38:13.688
"'l say this every minute."'

38:13.761 --> 38:18.763
"'l need you."'

38:18.835 --> 38:23.801
"'l need you."'

38:23.875 --> 38:28.627
"'l need you."'

38:53.523 --> 38:55.502
Sahiba.

38:56.443 --> 38:57.757
Guru is here.

39:04.124 --> 39:09.125
"'l shared a deep
relation with darkness."'

39:09.198 --> 39:14.056
"'You made me aware of light."'

39:14.134 --> 39:19.171
"'l"ve returned to
this darkness now."'

39:19.243 --> 39:24.208
"'But it seems unknown to me."'

39:24.283 --> 39:29.000
"'Loneliness has left me."'

39:29.079 --> 39:33.725
"'lsolation has
refused to accept me."'

39:33.806 --> 39:38.807
"'l"m incomplete."'

39:38.881 --> 39:43.598
"'l"m a punishment for myself."'

39:43.677 --> 39:48.678
"'l need you."'

39:48.752 --> 39:53.718
"'l need you."'

39:53.792 --> 39:59.066
"'l need you."'

40:02.064 --> 40:05.465
Stop!

41:33.822 --> 41:41.822
"'l"m incomplete."'

42:05.416 --> 42:07.039
Put the pistol down!

42:10.699 --> 42:14.657
Guru, today l learnt that
the value of dogs is known...

42:14.731 --> 42:17.196
...only after a lion arrives.

42:17.477 --> 42:18.685
Why did you kill her?

42:19.041 --> 42:21.884
What? What did you say, Guru?

42:22.551 --> 42:24.530
How could you even think...

42:25.749 --> 42:29.351
...that the one who raised you
like a father and gave you life...

42:29.954 --> 42:33.047
...would take away your
reason to live from you?

42:34.160 --> 42:39.398
But if you still feel
that l"ve killed your Aisha...

42:40.277 --> 42:41.592
...then take this gun.

42:41.668 --> 42:42.668
Take it!

42:43.267 --> 42:44.440
And shoot me!

42:44.796 --> 42:48.991
Fire all the bullets in it at me!

42:49.071 --> 42:50.457
Why did you kill her?

42:50.530 --> 42:51.530
Shoot me!

42:51.991 --> 42:53.199
Shoot me now!

42:53.276 --> 42:54.283
Shoot me!

42:54.841 --> 42:57.056
Don"t fear. Shoot me!

43:09.334 --> 43:10.365
Guru.

43:11.906 --> 43:15.508
Don"t let this fire
in you douse, Guru!

43:16.251 --> 43:19.308
Burn the world with this lava!

43:20.144 --> 43:22.086
Then come back here!

43:23.098 --> 43:24.864
To me!

43:25.218 --> 43:30.325
Because a lion deserves
to be in the forest!

43:30.675 --> 43:33.305
You are a lion! My lion!

43:33.385 --> 43:35.636
You are an idiot!

43:35.715 --> 43:37.765
You"re completely useless.

43:37.834 --> 43:40.986
Oh, God! Rakesh Mahadkar,
what do l do with you?

43:41.068 --> 43:42.691
What is all this nonsense!

43:53.163 --> 43:54.265
Madam.
- Brijesh!

43:54.796 --> 43:57.818
l"ve made a lot of
money in the illegal deal.

43:57.890 --> 44:00.698
l"ve brought your share honestly.

44:00.983 --> 44:02.642
You"re very naughty.

44:03.033 --> 44:05.143
Why don"t you explain
to your friend?

44:05.605 --> 44:08.828
You"re so active,
while he"s the laziest.

44:08.907 --> 44:10.627
He comes and asks
me what his chances are...

44:10.651 --> 44:13.034
...for being the
employee of the month.

44:13.114 --> 44:16.372
The Xerox machine in this
office works more than you.

44:16.450 --> 44:17.623
The Xerox machine!

44:18.292 --> 44:20.332
Really, you are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.

44:20.343 --> 44:22.629
You don"t have that talent.

44:22.706 --> 44:25.894
Madam, he is a 2 rupee man.

44:25.973 --> 44:27.560
lt"s true.

44:27.642 --> 44:30.829
The Xerox machine in this office works
more than you. The Xerox machine!

44:30.908 --> 44:35.008
Really, you are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.

44:35.079 --> 44:36.358
Where are you lost?

44:36.782 --> 44:39.591
Have you come here to repair
the phone or waste your time?

44:39.946 --> 44:41.048
Lazy man!

44:41.405 --> 44:44.085
That "s why people don" t have telephones
in their homes these days.

44:44.117 --> 44:45.645
Your service is so bad.

44:46.167 --> 44:47.589
When we call you, you don"t come.

44:47.661 --> 44:49.901
And when you come, you don"t
even provide proper service.

44:50.546 --> 44:52.106
Look, l"m warning
you for the last time.

44:52.130 --> 44:55.613
lf my phone doesn"t work, then
l"ll just get the connection cut.

44:55.691 --> 44:58.570
Then l won"t have to
tolerate lazy people like you.

44:58.645 --> 44:59.645
And...

45:01.078 --> 45:03.188
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

45:03.268 --> 45:05.175
Have you come to
repair the phone or...

45:07.056 --> 45:08.056
Madam.

45:08.794 --> 45:10.381
Don"t worry.

45:11.678 --> 45:14.178
You"ll have no complaints
against us henceforth.

45:16.961 --> 45:18.833
"You shouldn"t have yelled at me."

45:20.194 --> 45:21.817
Everyone makes fun of me.

45:23.148 --> 45:24.285
They call me lazy.

45:25.755 --> 45:26.755
They call me a beggar.

45:27.493 --> 45:29.021
They abuse me.

45:30.447 --> 45:32.947
"My friend Brijesh is right."

45:33.471 --> 45:35.343
"We"re middleclass people..."

45:35.904 --> 45:38.606
"...who are sandwiched between
the upper and the lower."

45:39.658 --> 45:41.009
"The world tortures us."

45:41.708 --> 45:43.474
"The system tortures us."

45:44.211 --> 45:46.011
And when we go home,
our wives torture us too.

45:46.091 --> 45:47.531
Today l don"t want you in the house.

45:47.555 --> 45:48.622
Get out.

45:48.903 --> 45:50.290
l said out.

45:50.850 --> 45:54.950
Sometimes l feel like killing her.

45:59.052 --> 46:01.031
But l can never
raise my hand at her.

46:03.641 --> 46:05.583
l love my wife a lot.

46:06.595 --> 46:07.625
"My Sulo."

46:08.854 --> 46:09.921
"Sulochana."

46:10.974 --> 46:12.597
"Sulo is her pet name."

46:13.372 --> 46:14.794
"She means the world to me."

46:15.771 --> 46:16.931
"She means everything to me."

46:17.508 --> 46:20.079
Creep! Who the hell
do you think you are!

46:20.150 --> 46:21.217
Oh, l know who you are!

46:21.297 --> 46:22.657
A bloody little pig!
- "You know...

46:23.010 --> 46:24.410
Frustrated pervert!
- You know what?

46:24.434 --> 46:27.030
l"ve never even looked
at another woman but her."

46:28.283 --> 46:29.291
"Why should l?"

46:30.333 --> 46:33.391
"My Sulo is so beautiful."
- Look at his face!

46:34.886 --> 46:36.166
"She could have found anyone."

46:37.007 --> 46:38.915
"But she chose me."

46:43.194 --> 46:44.924
What? Who are you?

46:45.209 --> 46:46.240
Telephone maintenance.

46:47.121 --> 46:48.329
l need to check your phone.

46:49.068 --> 46:50.134
lt"ll be done in no time.

46:50.493 --> 46:51.595
Fine. Over there.

46:56.888 --> 46:58.724
She has all the right to yell at me.

47:01.893 --> 47:05.151
Yes, l do feel very angry.

47:10.234 --> 47:16.065
And instead of her,
when l kill other women like you...

47:19.515 --> 47:21.624
...l feel much better.

47:23.581 --> 47:25.761
"As all of you die..."

47:26.605 --> 47:30.148
"...l get rid of all
my worries and stress."

47:31.993 --> 47:34.173
"Your pain doesn"t make me happy."

47:35.017 --> 47:36.190
"lt satisfies me."

47:37.171 --> 47:38.273
By killing you...

47:41.759 --> 47:43.774
...l keep my love alive.

47:44.435 --> 47:49.886
And l take a gift for
my Sulo from every corpse.

47:52.673 --> 47:55.860
"Usually,
a person is born ordinary."

47:56.774 --> 47:57.894
"He lives an ordinary life."

47:58.269 --> 47:59.371
"He dies ordinarily."

48:01.153 --> 48:03.060
"lf not on the big
screen or in the world..."

48:03.691 --> 48:08.549
"...he should be a hero
at least in his house."

48:09.321 --> 48:10.388
"l want you to wear it."

48:11.372 --> 48:12.439
"Who?"

48:13.597 --> 48:14.597
"Her."

48:16.864 --> 48:17.864
"You."

48:18.879 --> 48:21.130
"Whose necklace have
you stolen for me?"

48:24.163 --> 48:25.335
"What did you say?"

48:25.970 --> 48:27.628
"You think l"m a thief?"

48:31.600 --> 48:33.258
Rakesh, what are you doing?
Leave it.

48:35.702 --> 48:39.696
"My Sulo gets happy
when she gets a gift."

48:41.610 --> 48:42.925
"lt makes me happy, too."

48:43.314 --> 48:44.314
Eat.

48:44.982 --> 48:48.134
"My family becomes a happy family."

48:49.083 --> 48:49.913
Are you dieting?

48:49.986 --> 48:52.001
l do this for my family.

48:52.594 --> 48:54.146
"For their happiness."

48:55.444 --> 48:57.280
"l have just one dream in life."

48:58.468 --> 49:01.419
"That my Sulo
considers me her hero."

49:02.881 --> 49:04.361
"That she tells
me that she loves me."

49:05.732 --> 49:07.225
"So that even l can say to her..."

49:09.243 --> 49:12.395
Madam, don"t worry.

49:14.873 --> 49:17.575
You won"t have any complaints
against me henceforth.

49:29.888 --> 49:32.696
A criminal always goes
back to the crime scene.

49:33.294 --> 49:36.659
And a lover always comes back
to the place where he fell in love.

49:37.360 --> 49:40.583
l sent you to Goa with high hopes,
to kill Caesar.

49:45.216 --> 49:46.602
Can l tell you a secret?

49:47.267 --> 49:49.174
He didn"t kill your wife.

49:49.665 --> 49:50.665
lt was someone else.

49:52.931 --> 49:57.198
A beast like you who"s killing
women using different weapons.

49:58.215 --> 50:00.988
But do you know what
his most special weapon is?

50:02.421 --> 50:03.772
A screwdriver.

50:05.027 --> 50:06.027
Look at this.

50:07.947 --> 50:09.227
He has committed these murders..

50:09.251 --> 50:11.002
..in such brutal ways.

50:11.423 --> 50:15.417
lt"s difficult to make
out who"s someone"s mother...

50:16.567 --> 50:18.439
...and who "s someone" s wife.

50:22.545 --> 50:23.789
You "re angry, aren" t you?

50:24.700 --> 50:25.979
You"re furious.

50:27.446 --> 50:30.847
But just as you didn"t
let me take my revenge...

50:31.929 --> 50:34.986
...l won"t let you
take your revenge either.

50:38.220 --> 50:39.915
Let"s see who wins now.

50:40.723 --> 50:43.390
Your love or my hatred.

50:57.753 --> 50:59.660
Thank you! Thank you!

50:59.734 --> 51:02.093
Bye, dear! Bye!

51:06.859 --> 51:09.632
l want to help you fulfill
the remaining wishes in your diary.

51:18.539 --> 51:20.067
Do you want to hear a joke?

51:21.597 --> 51:22.355
Yes.

51:22.431 --> 51:25.061
Forget it. l don"t want to say it.

51:26.220 --> 51:28.900
Because you"ll listen to the joke
as if you"re sympathizing with me.

51:29.660 --> 51:30.660
Thank you.

51:30.738 --> 51:32.717
But l don"t need it.

51:33.866 --> 51:38.760
l"ve breathed in this
city as much as l could.

51:39.775 --> 51:45.013
Now it"s time to fly to another place
and breathe for as long as l can.

51:47.247 --> 51:48.942
My father was addicted to gambling.

51:50.793 --> 51:54.265
He used to bet in cards,
cricket, everything.

51:55.798 --> 51:58.784
And one day, he lost so
much that he bet on his life.

52:00.177 --> 52:04.206
"l was 8 years old when my
parents were killed in front of me."

52:09.075 --> 52:11.184
"l was hiding under the bed."

52:14.045 --> 52:16.095
"l didn"t do anything to save them."

52:16.930 --> 52:19.988
"After that, people tried
to give me shelter in their homes."

52:20.405 --> 52:23.593
"But l didn"t want shelter.
l wanted revenge."

52:25.236 --> 52:26.895
"One day, l took my revenge."

52:29.095 --> 52:31.453
"l killed those people
who orphaned me."

52:35.942 --> 52:37.672
"l thought l"d be
peaceful after that."

52:39.209 --> 52:40.382
"That l"d be able to sleep."

52:44.319 --> 52:45.563
"But l was wrong."

52:48.524 --> 52:51.676
The other day,
when l helped Chotu with you...

52:53.007 --> 52:54.807
...was the first time
that l slept peacefully.

52:55.405 --> 52:56.435
l was relaxed.

52:59.994 --> 53:01.001
Why did that happen?

53:07.745 --> 53:10.731
Because for the first time,
you did something for someone else.

53:12.506 --> 53:13.906
Darkness cannot drive out darkness.

53:15.044 --> 53:17.118
Only light can do that.

53:18.623 --> 53:19.938
Hate cannot drive out hate.

53:20.292 --> 53:22.057
Only love can do that.

53:23.211 --> 53:26.304
That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear...

53:27.452 --> 53:29.004
...is still over there.

53:30.093 --> 53:32.416
He only needs someone"s hand.

53:34.507 --> 53:35.929
Someone"s support.

53:36.767 --> 53:39.990
Someone who can pull him out of
the darkness and bring him to light.

53:43.857 --> 53:46.216
Unless we share
someone else"s pain...

53:48.861 --> 53:53.413
...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain.

54:17.328 --> 54:22.329
"'This is where nightfall happens."'

54:22.680 --> 54:27.752
"'This is where it"s dawn."'

54:28.033 --> 54:32.892
"'This is where l
have to live and die."'

54:33.316 --> 54:39.467
"'This is where l find spirituality."'

54:52.084 --> 54:57.286
"'This is where nightfall happens."'

54:57.368 --> 55:02.369

55:25.243 --> 55:28.016
"'Your home."'

55:28.093 --> 55:30.238
"'Your home."'

55:30.318 --> 55:35.555
"'l yearn for your abode."'

55:58.053 --> 56:02.568
"'You sleep in my slumber."'

56:03.336 --> 56:07.851
"'You cry over my tears."'

56:08.584 --> 56:13.585
"'Someone whispers in my thoughts."'

56:14.007 --> 56:18.451
"'l feel your presence
even when you"re not around."'

56:18.803 --> 56:23.425
"'You are the cure..."'

56:24.156 --> 56:32.156
"'...to my pain."'

56:55.716 --> 57:01.202
"'l yearn for your abode."'

57:23.139 --> 57:27.820
"'What kind of a
relationship do we share?"'

57:28.665 --> 57:33.488
"'lt has no name,
but it"s still so deep."'

57:33.878 --> 57:38.630
"'These moments are priceless."'

57:39.300 --> 57:43.886
"'We might lose them."'

57:43.958 --> 57:51.958
"'Let this moment..."'

57:52.925 --> 58:00.249
"'...come to a halt."'

58:00.328 --> 58:04.630
"'Don"t go away from me."'

58:05.403 --> 58:07.868
"'Your home."'

58:08.218 --> 58:10.541
"'Your home."'

58:10.617 --> 58:16.068
"'l yearn for your abode."'

58:55.209 --> 58:56.209
Aisha!

59:02.682 --> 59:03.682
Aisha.

59:06.749 --> 59:09.000
l slipped. l"m fine.

59:09.391 --> 59:11.298
Aisha, you"re not well.
Let"s go back.

59:12.519 --> 59:13.526
Are you crazy?

59:14.882 --> 59:16.897
Peacocks dance only
on the first rain.

59:17.420 --> 59:20.050
Since we"ve come this far,
let"s wait for some time.

59:20.130 --> 59:21.370
You can see it some other time.

59:21.394 --> 59:22.474
Let"s go back now. Come on.

59:22.494 --> 59:25.445
l don"t have much time.

59:47.345 --> 59:51.339
The peacock danced already.
Come next year, sir!

59:51.411 --> 59:52.655
lt"s going to rain heavily.

01:00:01.352 --> 01:00:02.359
You"re back?

01:00:03.438 --> 01:00:05.452
lt"s impossible for her to survive.

01:00:06.009 --> 01:00:08.260
Please don"t waste my time.

01:00:08.721 --> 01:00:09.728
l just can"t help her.

01:00:15.428 --> 01:00:17.478
Hey! Who do you think you are!

01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:19.136
Are you God!
- What are you doing!

01:00:19.217 --> 01:00:21.257
Back off! Are you God
to say that she can"t survive!

01:00:21.616 --> 01:00:24.318
Save her or l"ll kill you today!
Save her!

01:00:24.396 --> 01:00:27.382
lf l could save her, then wouldn"t
l have saved my wife first...

01:00:27.454 --> 01:00:30.298
...who is dying each day with cancer!

01:00:32.043 --> 01:00:37.352
ln spite of being a doctor,
l am as helpless as you are.

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:48.819
lf you have to try one last time...

01:00:51.436 --> 01:00:53.344
...then take Aisha to Mumbai.

01:00:55.086 --> 01:00:56.401
There"s a doctor over there.

01:00:57.728 --> 01:00:59.150
Prema Shrivastav.

01:01:00.092 --> 01:01:01.443
"She couldn"t help me."

01:01:02.768 --> 01:01:04.747
"But maybe she can help you."

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:57.822
Guru, you fulfilled
so many wishes of mine.

01:01:58.379 --> 01:01:59.517
Can you fulfil another one?

01:02:00.499 --> 01:02:04.244
lf l die before
fulfilling all these...

01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:08.136
...then you fulfil the rest
of the wishes for me. Okay?

01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:10.955
But don"t worry.

01:02:11.691 --> 01:02:16.336
Even after l die, don"t
think that l"ll leave you alone.

01:02:17.148 --> 01:02:18.771
l"ll always be with you.

01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:22.040
Like the breeze.

01:02:25.663 --> 01:02:31.671
just close your eyes
and feel the breeze.

01:02:34.144 --> 01:02:36.051
Whenever it touches your face...

01:02:37.306 --> 01:02:39.072
...it would mean that it"s me.

01:02:58.891 --> 01:03:00.478
God, thank You.

01:03:01.428 --> 01:03:03.407
Everything is perfect in my house.

01:03:04.625 --> 01:03:07.327
Mother and father
don"t quarrel anymore.

01:03:08.623 --> 01:03:10.566
Please keep everyone happy.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.043
And l promise to offer
my cars to you nine more times.

01:03:15.122 --> 01:03:16.189
Thank you.

01:03:20.093 --> 01:03:22.522
God, these are my favourite toys.

01:03:23.151 --> 01:03:25.296
Take them away.

01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:28.183
But please keep my family happy.

01:03:29.685 --> 01:03:30.693
Can l help?

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.934
Did a girl give you this?

01:03:44.005 --> 01:03:46.434
No. My father gave it to me.

01:04:04.477 --> 01:04:06.172
What are you doing?
You"re taking so long.

01:04:06.667 --> 01:04:08.717
lf we get late,
then the theatre will be full.

01:04:09.169 --> 01:04:12.843
And anyway, you can"t afford
to pay extra for the tickets.

01:04:13.618 --> 01:04:14.826
Hurry up.

01:04:21.821 --> 01:04:23.207
We will get the tickets, Sulo.

01:04:25.574 --> 01:04:26.641
Don"t worry.

01:04:27.659 --> 01:04:30.124
Why? ls it your father"s theatre?

01:04:30.197 --> 01:04:31.892
Did you get it as a gift?

01:04:32.352 --> 01:04:33.703
Look, l"m warning you.

01:04:33.985 --> 01:04:37.493
lf l miss the hero"s entry, then
l won"t watch the rest of the movie.

01:04:38.156 --> 01:04:41.557
Anyway, we get to see
a hero only on the big screen...

01:04:42.223 --> 01:04:43.467
...and not in real life.

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:46.486
What are you doing, Rakesh?
Leave this.

01:04:46.568 --> 01:04:47.568
Give it to me.

01:05:08.117 --> 01:05:09.740
Give us some money.

01:05:10.098 --> 01:05:12.278
l"ll pray you two
always stay together.

01:05:12.357 --> 01:05:13.222
Hold on.

01:05:13.296 --> 01:05:15.725
Give us happily.

01:05:15.798 --> 01:05:18.713
Give us some money.
- Give us some money.

01:05:18.788 --> 01:05:19.788
Take this.

01:05:19.934 --> 01:05:21.700
l don"t have more than this.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.200
Okay.

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.060
Why did you give them money?

01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:28.551
They were harassing us.

01:05:28.867 --> 01:05:31.959
lf l hadn"t given them money,
then they wouldn"t have gone.

01:05:33.072 --> 01:05:34.730
What kind of a man is he?

01:05:35.367 --> 01:05:37.417
Anyone can take advantage of him.

01:05:41.345 --> 01:05:44.817
Driver, stop. Please stop.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.973
Why are you getting down?

01:05:47.601 --> 01:05:49.852
l don"t have money
to go any further.

01:05:50.277 --> 01:05:53.085
What?
- l spent all the money, Sulo.

01:05:54.552 --> 01:05:56.247
Driver, take this.

01:05:58.132 --> 01:06:00.348
Come. Let"s go.
- Leave him.

01:06:02.616 --> 01:06:03.616
Go.

01:06:03.624 --> 01:06:04.975
But Sulo...

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:08.584
But what?
You think l don"t have any money?

01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:11.745
l"ve saved some money.
lt"s my money.

01:06:13.077 --> 01:06:18.944
lf l depend on you, then l"ll
have to beg on the street someday.

01:06:19.021 --> 01:06:22.979
Let"s go, driver.
- But Sulo... how will l go home?

01:06:23.366 --> 01:06:26.280
just as you go everyday!
ln the crowded train!

01:06:28.335 --> 01:06:30.906
"l married you with many dreams."

01:06:31.499 --> 01:06:34.757
"But all my dreams have shattered."

01:06:34.835 --> 01:06:36.636
"Every small business man
has a car now."

01:06:36.713 --> 01:06:38.727
"But you"ll always remain a beggar."

01:06:38.798 --> 01:06:41.465
"l"m ill fated. lt"s not your mistake."

01:06:41.786 --> 01:06:44.073
"You"re an idiot."

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:47.029
You"re useless, man.

01:06:47.382 --> 01:06:49.397
You"re completely useless.

01:06:50.128 --> 01:06:53.600
Then what happened? You know
what had happened on Christmas?

01:07:07.681 --> 01:07:10.490
lt"s not your cup of tea.

01:07:10.948 --> 01:07:13.483
You"re running behind her.

01:07:13.554 --> 01:07:15.213
But you"ll not get her.

01:07:15.293 --> 01:07:16.501
She won"t listen to you.

01:07:16.578 --> 01:07:18.758
But will you not listen to me?

01:07:18.838 --> 01:07:20.425
l had told you.

01:07:20.506 --> 01:07:23.528
Listen to me and do something.

01:07:34.235 --> 01:07:35.515
Did you stop laughing now?

01:07:37.224 --> 01:07:38.990
You were laughing at me,
weren"t you?

01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:42.811
All of you like making
fun of me, right?

01:07:47.964 --> 01:07:51.708
The Xerox machine in
the office works more than me.

01:07:59.051 --> 01:08:00.958
Call your Xerox machine.

01:08:01.415 --> 01:08:03.251
To save your life.

01:08:06.211 --> 01:08:07.799
Don"t worry, madam.

01:08:09.722 --> 01:08:13.989
Henceforth, you won"t
have any complaints against me.

01:08:43.715 --> 01:08:45.171
She slipped and fell.

01:08:46.321 --> 01:08:49.756
When l came walking from there,
l saw her lying here.

01:09:19.444 --> 01:09:22.111
Hey.. Help.

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.741
l won"t let you die.

01:09:29.037 --> 01:09:31.087
But l will still kill you every day.

01:09:31.818 --> 01:09:35.741
Not once, but a thousand times.

01:09:36.267 --> 01:09:38.801
You will face death each time...

01:09:39.429 --> 01:09:42.024
...but it won"t come to you.

01:09:42.593 --> 01:09:45.506
The more you try to embrace death...

01:09:46.277 --> 01:09:48.564
...the longer you"ll live.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:52.670
l will keep an account of
every drop of blood that you shed.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:57.181
l will capture your last breath.

01:09:58.268 --> 01:10:00.591
l"ll hit you so much...

01:10:01.466 --> 01:10:04.760
...that you will be in
pain as long as you"re alive...

01:10:05.219 --> 01:10:08.371
...and your soul will
scream after you die.

01:10:24.161 --> 01:10:26.732
Hit me.

01:10:26.803 --> 01:10:28.853
Hit me. Why do you spare me?

01:10:29.271 --> 01:10:31.629
Hit me.

01:10:48.769 --> 01:10:51.992
Go in and get yourself treated.

01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:53.385
First you hit me...

01:10:54.052 --> 01:10:55.190
...then you save me...

01:10:56.242 --> 01:10:58.482
...and then you bring me
to a hospital and give me money.

01:10:59.508 --> 01:11:00.895
Who are you?

01:11:02.011 --> 01:11:04.820
l am the one who won"t
let you die in peace...

01:11:05.418 --> 01:11:07.041
...nor will l let you live in peace.

01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:11.742
Get the medicine.
Get yourself cured.

01:11:12.785 --> 01:11:14.728
Because once your pain is soothed...

01:11:16.053 --> 01:11:17.890
...once your wounds are healed...

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:21.573
...l"ll be back to
inflict new wounds.

01:11:22.656 --> 01:11:24.730
This is your fate now.

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:26.754
This is your punishment.

01:11:36.003 --> 01:11:38.776
Mother, who hit father?

01:11:39.201 --> 01:11:40.201
Keep quiet.

01:11:40.348 --> 01:11:41.348
Go out.

01:11:44.623 --> 01:11:47.645
Listen. Stay inside the hospital.

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:50.561
Don"t go out. Okay?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.552
Your boss was attacked yesterday.

01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:56.465
Today you were attacked.

01:11:56.753 --> 01:11:58.898
Either the whole office
has a lot of enemies...

01:11:58.978 --> 01:12:00.850
...or you "re each other" s enemies.

01:12:00.924 --> 01:12:03.069
Come on. Tell me from the beginning.

01:12:03.149 --> 01:12:05.223
Excuse me. What are you doing?

01:12:05.547 --> 01:12:07.707
You"re not allowed to give
outside food to the patient.

01:12:08.119 --> 01:12:10.264
Do you want him to eat
the hospital food?

01:12:10.343 --> 01:12:12.073
Do you intend to make him sick?

01:12:12.464 --> 01:12:14.300
These are the rules of the hospital.

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:17.254
You"re not allowed to give
the patient anything besides fruits.

01:12:17.329 --> 01:12:18.431
Close your lunchbox.

01:12:18.511 --> 01:12:20.526
l"m closing it.
Can"t you see? l won"t give him.

01:12:20.597 --> 01:12:21.597
But they didn"t listen.

01:12:21.848 --> 01:12:22.848
l"m warning you.

01:12:23.169 --> 01:12:26.048
This will not be tolerated here.
- Then they started hitting me.

01:12:26.123 --> 01:12:27.123
l can"t believe this.

01:12:27.131 --> 01:12:30.461
You can"t help it, sir.
Some people are very bad.

01:12:30.538 --> 01:12:32.178
Fine. l"ll come back for
more information.

01:12:32.205 --> 01:12:33.556
- Show me those medicines.

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:37.376
You"ve never even
killed a fly at home.

01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:43.215
What was the need to hit goons
on the street and try to be a hero?

01:12:43.745 --> 01:12:45.925
Look at your face.
Look what you"ve done to yourself.

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:49.109
Moreover, you got yourself
admitted in such a reputed hospital.

01:12:49.236 --> 01:12:52.602
How will we pay the fees?

01:12:57.092 --> 01:12:58.092
Take this.

01:12:58.621 --> 01:12:59.621
For the fees.

01:13:09.951 --> 01:13:11.444
This...

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.526
l don"t like to yell at you.

01:13:26.009 --> 01:13:27.632
But if something
had happened to you...

01:13:30.631 --> 01:13:32.219
...then what would my Manu have done?

01:13:33.969 --> 01:13:35.035
l"m sorry, Sulo.

01:13:40.746 --> 01:13:41.990
l love you.

01:13:51.591 --> 01:13:52.591
What"s this?

01:13:53.467 --> 01:13:56.275
l just told you that he"s
not allowed to eat outside food.

01:13:56.352 --> 01:13:58.710
Don"t you understand
when you"re explained once?

01:13:58.784 --> 01:14:01.035
Security!
- Why are you calling the security?

01:14:01.496 --> 01:14:04.031
What"s your job?
To clean everyone"s mess.

01:14:04.868 --> 01:14:06.847
But you"re behaving like a queen.

01:14:07.126 --> 01:14:09.697
Sulo. - l wonder
where they"ve come from.

01:14:09.768 --> 01:14:10.775
You leave.

01:14:13.035 --> 01:14:14.066
Take care.

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:17.056
l"m sorry, madam.

01:14:17.449 --> 01:14:19.665
l shouldn"t have any
complaints henceforth.

01:14:46.506 --> 01:14:48.201
l can"t get there.

01:15:06.109 --> 01:15:08.219
God!

01:15:09.098 --> 01:15:12.843
l "m sorry. l couldn" t come
to pray this week.

01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:20.629
Guru?

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.242
Are you okay?

01:15:25.086 --> 01:15:26.745
Listen, l"m really sorry.

01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:30.089
l can"t believe that
this happened to Aisha.

01:15:30.578 --> 01:15:33.173
God plays such
strange games with us.

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:37.805
She was going to bring
a new life into this world, but...

01:15:39.336 --> 01:15:40.336
Yes.

01:15:40.797 --> 01:15:42.111
She was pregnant.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.689
Didn"t she tell you?

01:15:47.157 --> 01:15:49.657
Anyway, l"m really sorry.

01:15:50.111 --> 01:15:52.221
Please take care of yourself.

01:16:18.891 --> 01:16:20.491
Again this tube light
started flickering.

01:16:22.019 --> 01:16:23.511
There"s no maintenance here.

01:17:14.084 --> 01:17:16.134
The more you struggle...

01:17:17.247 --> 01:17:18.775
...the more it"ll hurt.

01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:23.113
lf you stay calm,
l"ll kill you lovingly.

01:18:03.334 --> 01:18:05.764
You killed my baby.

01:18:05.838 --> 01:18:07.745
You killed my baby!

01:18:07.819 --> 01:18:09.655
She was pregnant.

01:18:12.441 --> 01:18:14.491
She was pregnant!

01:18:14.561 --> 01:18:15.770
You killed my baby.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.961
She was pregnant!

01:18:18.036 --> 01:18:20.016
She was pregnant!

01:18:20.088 --> 01:18:21.746
She was pregnant!

01:18:24.398 --> 01:18:25.950
She was pregnant!

01:18:26.378 --> 01:18:28.523
She was pregnant!

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:30.261
You killed my baby!

01:18:30.723 --> 01:18:34.397
He "s dead! He" s dead!

01:18:48.136 --> 01:18:49.136
Get up!

01:18:51.195 --> 01:18:54.596
Get up!

01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:59.848
You can"t die so easily.

01:18:59.919 --> 01:19:00.926
Get up!

01:19:01.379 --> 01:19:04.152
You can"t die so easily! Get up!

01:19:05.202 --> 01:19:10.997
Hey! You can"t die so easily!
Get up!

01:19:11.806 --> 01:19:13.264
Hey! Make him alive.

01:19:13.335 --> 01:19:17.495
Please let me go! l won"t tell anyone!
- Hey! He must live for me.

01:19:18.097 --> 01:19:20.111
He can"t die so easily!

01:19:20.182 --> 01:19:21.391
Bring him back to life!

01:19:28.872 --> 01:19:32.758
Get up!
- He needs..

01:19:33.877 --> 01:19:39.044
This... has to go... in his heart...

01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:06.191
He killed your baby.

01:20:08.459 --> 01:20:10.569
Even then you saved his life?

01:20:11.379 --> 01:20:12.379
Why?

01:20:14.438 --> 01:20:16.309
Why didn"t you let him die?

01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:19.440
Spare my son, Guru.

01:20:24.656 --> 01:20:26.766
The man who killed your son...

01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:29.554
...is he present in the court?

01:20:30.496 --> 01:20:33.304
Madam, is he present in the court?

01:20:34.319 --> 01:20:35.349
Answer me.

01:20:39.394 --> 01:20:40.394
No.

01:20:43.807 --> 01:20:45.086
He"s not here.

01:20:45.893 --> 01:20:47.551
l told the police also.

01:20:48.292 --> 01:20:53.044
Deepu"s death was an accident.

01:20:53.123 --> 01:20:57.117
Due to lack of evidence, Deepu"s
death is declared an accident...

01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:59.239
...and this case is dismissed.

01:20:59.309 --> 01:21:01.419
Accused is set free.

01:21:10.814 --> 01:21:13.136
l haven "t forgotten my son" s death.

01:21:14.742 --> 01:21:16.365
Nor am l scared of you.

01:21:17.348 --> 01:21:21.650
You want to know why l didn"t
testify against you, don"t you?

01:21:23.118 --> 01:21:30.371
Because you will be punished
not by a judge in court but by God.

01:21:31.425 --> 01:21:33.605
How did you get away from
the bullets the other day?

01:21:34.622 --> 01:21:38.781
Because He has a punishment
worse than death for you.

01:21:40.218 --> 01:21:43.441
One day, your dear one
will die in front of you.

01:21:45.223 --> 01:21:47.130
And you won"t be able to save him.

01:21:56.172 --> 01:21:58.008
Passenger, please pay attention.

01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:00.856
janshatabdi express from
Goa to Mumbai..

01:22:00.933 --> 01:22:03.742
..will depart from platform number 6
on it"s scheduled time.

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:05.927
Aisha.

01:22:06.007 --> 01:22:07.808
You"re always running in life.

01:22:08.997 --> 01:22:10.940
From one place to another.

01:22:13.098 --> 01:22:14.555
Who are you running away from today?

01:22:15.253 --> 01:22:16.746
l"m not running away from anyone.

01:22:16.817 --> 01:22:21.011
Look, dear,
there is a kind of laughter...

01:22:21.093 --> 01:22:25.501
...which a person learns
to hide his sorrow in life.

01:22:26.167 --> 01:22:28.074
And there is another
kind of laughter...

01:22:28.426 --> 01:22:31.305
...that helps a person
forget all his sorrow.

01:22:32.389 --> 01:22:35.991
You"ve found this laughter
after meeting Guru.

01:22:37.776 --> 01:22:39.304
You"ve found it in his love.

01:22:41.286 --> 01:22:42.909
What"s the use of this love...

01:22:45.596 --> 01:22:47.847
...that will make him
cry after making him smile?

01:22:50.601 --> 01:22:51.801
l"m not running away from him.

01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:56.819
l"m just stopping him
from running after me.

01:22:56.892 --> 01:22:57.892
Aisha!

01:22:58.248 --> 01:22:59.248
Aisha!

01:23:05.477 --> 01:23:06.507
Aisha!

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.473
Aisha!

01:23:24.975 --> 01:23:25.975
Aisha.

01:23:26.227 --> 01:23:27.227
Aisha!

01:23:27.513 --> 01:23:28.593
Do you want to hear a joke?

01:23:30.224 --> 01:23:31.752
Once, a man was drowning in the sea.

01:23:32.761 --> 01:23:35.048
He started praying
to God to save him.

01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:36.476
A fishing boat came.

01:23:37.627 --> 01:23:38.942
He said, "'Give me your hand."'

01:23:39.573 --> 01:23:41.268
The man said, "'No.
God will save me."'

01:23:42.076 --> 01:23:43.249
Then a ship came.

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.318
The captain said, "'Hold my hand."'

01:23:45.378 --> 01:23:47.949
He said, "'No. God will save me."'

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.371
The man drowned.

01:23:50.244 --> 01:23:54.273
After his death, he asked God,
"'Why didn"t You save me?"'

01:23:54.345 --> 01:23:57.640
God said, "'You think your
father sent that boat and ship?"'

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:07.133
Aisha, l know that l might
not be able to save you from dying.

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:12.030
But by holding my hand,
you can keep me alive.

01:24:14.504 --> 01:24:16.199
Hold my hand, Aisha.

01:24:17.284 --> 01:24:19.465
And get me out of
darkness into light.

01:24:21.455 --> 01:24:22.877
Hold my hand, Aisha!

01:24:23.715 --> 01:24:25.966
Pull me out of darkness
into light, Aisha!

01:24:29.901 --> 01:24:31.288
Aisha, don"t go.

01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:34.176
Aisha!

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:38.133
Aisha, don"t go.

01:24:47.663 --> 01:24:50.779
Aisha, don"t leave me.

01:24:53.641 --> 01:24:55.964
Aisha.

01:25:46.367 --> 01:25:47.954
Hey! Who pulled the chain?

01:25:56.238 --> 01:26:04.238
"'Why does life comprise
of just a few moments?"'

01:26:07.186 --> 01:26:11.630
"'Even centuries..."'

01:26:12.052 --> 01:26:17.159
"'...are not enough for love."'

01:26:17.509 --> 01:26:23.068
"'l want to ask God..."'

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:28.282
"'...for some more time."'

01:26:28.597 --> 01:26:33.455
"'l want to stay here forever."'

01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:39.950
"'l don"t want to be away from you."'

01:26:40.031 --> 01:26:45.305
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:26:45.384 --> 01:26:50.456
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:26:50.841 --> 01:26:55.948
"'No pain seems painful."'

01:26:56.576 --> 01:27:01.992
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:04.810
After meeting Aisha,
l"ve realised...

01:27:04.882 --> 01:27:06.790
...that it"s very
easy to kill someone.

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:09.505
But it"s very difficult
to save someone"s life.

01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:14.126
You may kill me if you want.

01:27:15.171 --> 01:27:17.185
But l won"t kill anyone again.

01:27:34.530 --> 01:27:35.917
Go.

01:27:38.284 --> 01:27:40.643
Go. l"m fine.

01:27:46.522 --> 01:27:51.938
"'Your smile is my strength."'

01:27:52.014 --> 01:27:57.465
"'l"ve found hope because of it."'

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:03.098
"'No matter how much
the world torments me..."'

01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:07.886
"'...l find solace in it."'

01:28:07.967 --> 01:28:13.655
"'Life has become beautiful."'

01:28:13.736 --> 01:28:19.223
"'This is heaven."'

01:28:19.297 --> 01:28:24.155
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:29.580
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:28:30.211 --> 01:28:35.734
"'No pain seems painful."'

01:28:35.807 --> 01:28:40.738
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:28:44.392 --> 01:28:46.821
These are Aisha"s latest
pathological tests.

01:29:05.836 --> 01:29:06.867
Here"s your dairy.

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:12.363
You have time to fulfill
every wish of yours.

01:29:13.935 --> 01:29:16.602
We have the time.
- Yes.

01:29:17.516 --> 01:29:20.573
We will fulfill it together.
- Yes.

01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:24.870
You have the rest
of your life, Aisha.

01:29:28.916 --> 01:29:30.539
You have the rest of your life.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.844
You will live, Aisha.

01:29:35.242 --> 01:29:36.249
You will live, Aisha.

01:29:37.570 --> 01:29:38.778
You will live.

01:29:47.823 --> 01:29:52.966
"'My life depends
on your heartbeats."'

01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:58.905
"'Your desires are now my prayers."'

01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:04.396
"'This is such an unusual bond."'

01:30:04.472 --> 01:30:09.330
"'We"re one now."'

01:30:09.407 --> 01:30:14.752
"'l will come back to you."'

01:30:14.829 --> 01:30:20.589
"'l promise you."'
"'Even if l die."'

01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:26.049
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:30:26.125 --> 01:30:30.569
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:30:31.548 --> 01:30:37.236
"'No pain seems painful."'

01:30:37.317 --> 01:30:42.591
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:47.565
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:30:48.231 --> 01:30:52.948
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:30:53.861 --> 01:30:59.277
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:04.460
"'When you"re my companion."'

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:09.980
ls this okay?

01:31:10.301 --> 01:31:11.924
You look like a hero.

01:31:12.004 --> 01:31:14.404
lf l was the interviewer,
do you know what l would have done?

01:31:16.245 --> 01:31:18.152
Wait. Let me get curd
and sugar for good luck.

01:31:23.405 --> 01:31:24.405
Hi, Dr. Prema.

01:31:24.656 --> 01:31:26.279
Aisha, your reports have come.

01:31:27.506 --> 01:31:29.414
And they state that you"re pregnant.

01:31:31.607 --> 01:31:33.100
Aisha!

01:31:33.832 --> 01:31:35.942
Are you there?
- Yeah.

01:31:37.239 --> 01:31:38.246
Doctor...

01:31:40.505 --> 01:31:43.384
Will my illness have
a negative effect on my baby?

01:31:44.155 --> 01:31:47.829
No, Aisha.
Your baby is not in danger.

01:31:47.978 --> 01:31:49.921
But l"m concerned about you.

01:31:50.272 --> 01:31:53.909
Aisha, l don"t think you have the
strength to give birth to this baby.

01:31:54.755 --> 01:31:57.078
You"ve just come into
remission from your illness.

01:31:57.641 --> 01:32:00.034
Your body is still very weak.

01:32:00.699 --> 01:32:06.364
l think you should tell Guru
about your pregnancy and this risk.

01:32:07.477 --> 01:32:10.570
"He"s the father of this child.
He has a right to know."

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:14.315
"You both must take this decision
and that too very quickly."

01:32:14.394 --> 01:32:16.336
Aisha, what are you doing?
lt"s behind.

01:32:24.055 --> 01:32:25.055
Listen.

01:32:30.972 --> 01:32:31.979
Best of luck.

01:33:43.753 --> 01:33:47.498
Aisha, are you sure
you want this child?

01:33:48.272 --> 01:33:50.179
Did you tell Guru?

01:33:51.748 --> 01:33:53.276
l will tell him.

01:33:55.431 --> 01:33:56.818
l"m just afraid...

01:33:58.907 --> 01:34:03.659
...that if he feels that something might
happen to me because of this baby...

01:34:05.685 --> 01:34:07.593
...then he"ll try to stop me.

01:34:08.222 --> 01:34:10.058
But his fear is justified, dear.

01:34:15.348 --> 01:34:17.706
But this life that
l"ve got because of Guru...

01:34:20.526 --> 01:34:27.127
...is playing
hide-and-seek with death.

01:34:29.076 --> 01:34:31.647
lt has to end someday.

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:36.436
Then my Guru will be
back into the darkness.

01:34:40.268 --> 01:34:44.498
He will need someone then,
who"ll hold his hand...

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:46.201
...and bring him into light.

01:34:46.906 --> 01:34:48.565
And the one who"ll hold his hand...

01:34:50.382 --> 01:34:51.733
...will be our child.

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.055
My child, light and darkness means life.

01:34:59.767 --> 01:35:03.274
Now, He"ll show you the correct path.

01:35:04.459 --> 01:35:07.517
The Lord"s and my blessings
are always with you.

01:35:12.766 --> 01:35:14.875
Have you worked somewhere earlier?

01:35:22.290 --> 01:35:24.992
Actually, l shouldn"t crack
jokes about God in front of God.

01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:28.186
l"m sorry.
Don"t mind, but l have no mind.

01:35:28.268 --> 01:35:29.298
Catch.. catch.

01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:34.306
Oh gosh!

01:35:40.432 --> 01:35:44.177
Hey, mister!
Yes, l"m talking to you.

01:35:44.743 --> 01:35:47.551
Aren"t there enough potholes in the
city that you"ve dug another one?

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:49.990
For the past two weeks.

01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:52.454
Those kids and my God were
saved by a hair"s breadth today.

01:35:52.528 --> 01:35:53.768
"All my dreams have shattered."

01:35:53.918 --> 01:35:56.311
"lt"s not your mistake,
l"m ill fated."

01:35:56.385 --> 01:35:58.601
"l had many choices."

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:01.216
"But l was ill fated to marry you."

01:36:01.286 --> 01:36:03.194
"Middle class man."

01:36:04.067 --> 01:36:05.559
Don"t worry, madam.

01:36:05.979 --> 01:36:08.159
You won"t have any
complaints henceforth.

01:36:08.481 --> 01:36:11.052
Fine. Let"s see.

01:36:16.579 --> 01:36:17.579
Hello.

01:36:18.282 --> 01:36:19.977
Do you want to hear the
bad news first or the worst news?

01:36:20.403 --> 01:36:22.923
The bad news is that you"ll
have to live without me every day...

01:36:22.947 --> 01:36:24.262
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

01:36:25.651 --> 01:36:27.558
And the worst news is that l
won"t be able to live without you...

01:36:27.632 --> 01:36:28.947
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

01:36:29.544 --> 01:36:30.752
l got the job, Aisha.

01:36:31.803 --> 01:36:32.810
l got the job.

01:36:33.923 --> 01:36:35.096
l"m independent now.

01:36:36.044 --> 01:36:40.073
Guru, there"s something
that l have to say to you.

01:36:40.457 --> 01:36:41.457
Tell me.

01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:43.818
No. Come home first.

01:36:43.899 --> 01:36:45.522
Tell me. l"m on my way home.

01:36:45.949 --> 01:36:47.157
No, come home.

01:36:50.364 --> 01:36:52.864
Hello. How did you get in?

01:36:52.935 --> 01:36:53.935
Aisha?

01:36:55.543 --> 01:36:56.623
What are you doing?
- Aisha?

01:36:57.072 --> 01:36:58.672
Does anyone barge
into someone"s house...

01:36:58.743 --> 01:36:59.863
...without ringing the bell?

01:36:59.887 --> 01:37:01.023
Get out of here!

01:37:02.668 --> 01:37:04.220
Aisha, who"s over there? Aisha!

01:37:06.143 --> 01:37:08.323
Who is it? What happened, Aisha?

01:37:09.236 --> 01:37:10.931
Hey! Aisha!

01:37:11.322 --> 01:37:13.431
Listen! Whoever you are,
you"re my enemy.

01:37:13.824 --> 01:37:16.917
Guru!

01:37:16.988 --> 01:37:18.682
lt"s not her mistake.
Spare her. Aisha!

01:37:18.759 --> 01:37:21.568
Hey! Listen! Spare her. Aisha!

01:37:22.479 --> 01:37:23.479
Aisha!
- Guru!

01:37:23.486 --> 01:37:24.908
Stop! Taxi! Stop!

01:37:24.981 --> 01:37:28.691
Aisha! - Guru!
- Aisha! l"m coming.

01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:32.098
Help me.

01:37:37.564 --> 01:37:38.630
l"m pregnant.

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.219
Please don"t kill me.

01:37:46.357 --> 01:37:48.502
l want to give birth to this baby.

01:37:50.146 --> 01:37:51.603
l want to have this child.

01:37:53.899 --> 01:37:55.250
Please don"t kill me.

01:37:55.324 --> 01:37:59.069
Stop! Taxi, stop.

01:39:27.847 --> 01:39:30.726
Hurry up, deep.

01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:11.390
Hi.

01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:15.801
Am l disturbing you?

01:40:17.897 --> 01:40:21.499
l see. You were following Rakesh.

01:40:22.624 --> 01:40:23.624
Go.

01:40:25.926 --> 01:40:26.926
Run.

01:40:28.324 --> 01:40:29.497
Run!

01:40:30.688 --> 01:40:32.109
Hey, back off.

01:40:32.391 --> 01:40:33.599
Back..

01:40:33.677 --> 01:40:35.620
just a minute, Madam. Madam.

01:40:36.319 --> 01:40:37.919
Madam, do you know
where your husband is?

01:40:37.943 --> 01:40:40.477
Please, let us go.

01:40:40.558 --> 01:40:43.924
We didn"t do anything.

01:40:45.147 --> 01:40:47.256
l think there"s
some misunderstandings.

01:40:47.753 --> 01:40:49.898
My husband didn"t do anything.

01:40:49.978 --> 01:40:51.673
Do you remember what l told you?

01:40:52.306 --> 01:40:55.364
Whenever you try to take
your revenge, l"ll come in your way.

01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:57.130
Do you remember!

01:41:06.592 --> 01:41:08.701
l know you"re not
scared of my bullet.

01:41:09.928 --> 01:41:13.602
You know that if you follow him,
then the police will catch him.

01:41:14.273 --> 01:41:17.816
His crime will be proved and your
revenge will be left incomplete.

01:41:23.135 --> 01:41:25.386
Rakesh!

01:41:25.465 --> 01:41:27.407
Get inside.

01:41:29.427 --> 01:41:31.714
The police will catch
Rakesh Mahadkar eventually.

01:41:32.485 --> 01:41:34.428
Because his wife
is in their custody.

01:41:34.989 --> 01:41:38.211
But for now,
let"s go to the police station.

01:41:39.124 --> 01:41:41.340
Someone"s waiting
for you over there.

01:41:54.313 --> 01:41:55.627
Hey!

01:41:56.398 --> 01:41:57.713
You got beaten again?

01:41:57.789 --> 01:41:59.189
Will you come with me to Mira Road?

01:41:59.248 --> 01:42:00.776
Mira Road!

01:42:00.847 --> 01:42:02.340
You"ve become a man!

01:42:02.654 --> 01:42:03.827
Take me away from here.

01:42:03.906 --> 01:42:08.421
After being beaten, you
want someone to heal your wounds.

01:42:08.494 --> 01:42:13.175
Rakesh Mahadkar is the one
who killed women in the city.

01:42:13.255 --> 01:42:14.534
He"s absconding.

01:42:14.611 --> 01:42:17.704
But police is making all
the efforts to nab him.

01:42:18.886 --> 01:42:20.415
Look there.

01:42:31.885 --> 01:42:38.652
"'The world wants to
touch me in such a way..."'

01:42:41.548 --> 01:42:48.706
"'...as if l belong to them."'

01:42:51.036 --> 01:42:57.874
"'The world looks at my beauty."'

01:43:00.699 --> 01:43:06.850
"'No one understands
my helplessness."'

01:43:09.561 --> 01:43:16.779
"'l"m shattered completely."'

01:43:17.382 --> 01:43:19.183
Wow!

01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:27.259
"'l"ve gone crazy in your love."'

01:43:28.678 --> 01:43:36.678
"'l"m shattered completely."'

01:43:37.506 --> 01:43:38.514
Come on.

01:43:38.583 --> 01:43:46.156
"'l"ve gone crazy in your love."'

01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:53.035
You"re lying.

01:43:54.850 --> 01:43:56.686
Sir, l told you.

01:43:56.761 --> 01:44:00.304
The one who saved
my life was a saviour.

01:44:00.376 --> 01:44:02.485
l couldn"t recognise him.

01:44:02.809 --> 01:44:04.124
Tell me something.

01:44:04.547 --> 01:44:05.233
Note down the details.

01:44:05.311 --> 01:44:06.626
Whether old or young...

01:44:06.702 --> 01:44:08.989
...why doesn"t any woman
testify against you?

01:44:11.290 --> 01:44:14.620
Do you have a mole at
a special place in your body?

01:44:16.191 --> 01:44:18.205
Wagle, take him in the custody.

01:44:26.757 --> 01:44:30.881
"'Some call me their pride."'

01:44:31.693 --> 01:44:35.722
"'Some pay me a price."'

01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:40.231
"'l smile at them."'

01:44:41.216 --> 01:44:45.730
"'But l"m crying from within."'

01:44:45.804 --> 01:44:50.426
"'You were priceless."'

01:44:50.496 --> 01:44:55.082
"'You would talk a lot."'

01:44:56.022 --> 01:45:00.774
"'Since you"re quiet..."'

01:45:00.853 --> 01:45:07.276
"'...you"ve taken all
my happiness away."'

01:45:12.289 --> 01:45:20.289
"'l"m shattered."'

01:45:21.777 --> 01:45:29.777
"'l"m ruined in your love."'

01:45:31.231 --> 01:45:38.282
"'l belong to you completely."'

01:45:40.928 --> 01:45:48.643
"'l"ve been bought by you."'

01:46:08.213 --> 01:46:12.242
l always thought you were a loser.

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:17.040
But you proved me wrong.

01:46:17.493 --> 01:46:22.007
Do you know how many
blessings you must have got...

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.154
...from those men
whose wives you killed?

01:46:24.618 --> 01:46:28.398
But what did my friendship lack?

01:46:28.893 --> 01:46:31.844
Why did you spare my wife?

01:46:33.064 --> 01:46:35.208
Why are you sitting here?

01:46:37.756 --> 01:46:39.735
Hey, handsome.
Will you come to the pool?

01:46:39.806 --> 01:46:41.334
Hey, hot baby!

01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:44.558
Tell me something.

01:46:44.638 --> 01:46:49.224
Do you want to sing a solo song
with him or a duet with both of us?

01:46:49.295 --> 01:46:53.703
Looks like your friend is neither
interested in a solo, nor in a duet.

01:46:53.779 --> 01:46:58.922
l think he"s either
impotent or he likes men.

01:46:58.993 --> 01:47:04.752
You"re talking too much.
But you don"t know my friend.

01:47:04.831 --> 01:47:09.098
Brother, you"ll have to shut her up.

01:47:09.176 --> 01:47:10.942
Come on. Have a drink.

01:47:12.166 --> 01:47:13.753
Darling, where"s the ice?

01:47:14.216 --> 01:47:16.158
l"ll just get it.

01:47:17.414 --> 01:47:23.422
Hot girls forget to
get the coldest thing.

01:47:25.825 --> 01:47:27.804
Who is this man who"s after me?

01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:32.252
He too is his wife"s lover,
just like you.

01:47:34.583 --> 01:47:38.743
l "m sure he" s the husband
Of one of the women that you killed.

01:47:38.824 --> 01:47:40.068
l"m sure.

01:47:40.388 --> 01:47:41.418
1 00 percent.

01:47:44.872 --> 01:47:46.886
He"s playing with you.

01:47:47.686 --> 01:47:51.123
just as a lion plays
with his prey in the forest.

01:47:51.927 --> 01:47:55.185
He catches it and then let"s it go,
and then catches it again.

01:47:55.854 --> 01:47:59.528
He chases it, catches it and
then let"s it go again.

01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:07.457
Until you keep running,
he"ll keep chasing you.

01:48:08.541 --> 01:48:13.020
The day you turn the tables,
you"ll be the hunter.

01:48:14.136 --> 01:48:15.902
And he"ll be the prey.

01:48:21.435 --> 01:48:23.415
"l won"t let you die."

01:48:25.050 --> 01:48:27.159
"But l will still
kill you every day."

01:48:27.449 --> 01:48:30.293
"The more you try
to embrace death..."

01:48:31.168 --> 01:48:33.182
"...the longer you"ll live."

01:48:43.368 --> 01:48:45.418
"She was pregnant."

01:48:47.156 --> 01:48:48.815
"You killed my baby.
She was pregnant."

01:48:50.979 --> 01:48:52.188
"l"m pregnant."

01:48:52.578 --> 01:48:54.829
"l want to give birth to this baby."

01:48:56.609 --> 01:48:59.276
"Guru!"

01:49:02.657 --> 01:49:04.494
My husband is the most kind...

01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:09.708
...truthful and decent
man in the world.

01:49:11.207 --> 01:49:12.830
He would murder someone...

01:49:17.255 --> 01:49:18.570
That"s impossible.

01:49:19.202 --> 01:49:21.560
This is Guru"s conspiracy.

01:49:22.955 --> 01:49:27.434
Maybe, he killed his wife too.

01:49:28.482 --> 01:49:30.556
And also those women.

01:49:31.054 --> 01:49:32.547
l"m telling you.

01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:35.426
Even the police
are involved in this.

01:49:36.406 --> 01:49:38.065
They are involved with Guru.

01:49:40.439 --> 01:49:44.563
They will kill my husband
and accuse him of everything.

01:49:46.451 --> 01:49:49.366
l beg of you.

01:49:50.066 --> 01:49:51.594
Please save my Rakesh.

01:49:52.916 --> 01:49:54.124
Please save my Rakesh.

01:49:56.670 --> 01:49:57.677
Lord!

01:50:00.284 --> 01:50:02.855
Please send my Rakesh back to me.

01:50:04.213 --> 01:50:05.943
l promise You.

01:50:07.235 --> 01:50:11.359
l will never ask him to leave the house.
l"ll never fight with him.

01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:17.900
Please send my Rakesh
back to me, God!

01:50:25.796 --> 01:50:27.075
l love you, Rakesh.

01:50:30.002 --> 01:50:31.009
Are you listening?

01:50:32.434 --> 01:50:33.749
Please come back home.

01:50:33.825 --> 01:50:34.825
Sulu..

01:50:35.146 --> 01:50:36.769
Wherever you are,
please come home.

01:50:38.865 --> 01:50:40.322
Come back.

01:50:43.696 --> 01:50:45.189
l love you, Rakesh.

01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:47.168
l love you, Sulo.

01:50:49.431 --> 01:50:51.754
Yes, sir. He"s been bailed.

01:50:52.107 --> 01:50:54.501
l"ll ask him to talk to you.
Hold on, sir.

01:50:54.575 --> 01:50:57.383
Sir, phone.
lt "s Caesar sir" s call, sir.

01:51:03.021 --> 01:51:04.265
Aisha Verma.

01:51:04.967 --> 01:51:08.890
Sai Kripa Society. Versova.

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.050
This was her address, right?

01:51:12.788 --> 01:51:15.039
When l learnt that she"s pregnant...

01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:17.478
...l was as happy as a person gets...

01:51:17.827 --> 01:51:20.494
...on knowing about
a buy 1 get 1 free offer.

01:51:21.059 --> 01:51:23.690
Buy a shampoo and
get a soap bar free.

01:51:24.396 --> 01:51:27.797
Kill the mother and the son
or the daughter is killed for free.

01:51:28.532 --> 01:51:30.263
l won"t punish you now.

01:51:30.548 --> 01:51:31.756
l"ll kill you.

01:51:31.834 --> 01:51:35.864
Sorry, but my life
was on a limited offer.

01:51:36.666 --> 01:51:38.645
Till stocks last only.

01:51:39.168 --> 01:51:41.147
You wanted to play with me.

01:51:41.914 --> 01:51:47.400
But now you"ll realise what a big
mistake you made by sparing my life.

01:51:47.753 --> 01:51:52.470
You want to take my Sulo
and my son away from me, right?

01:51:52.549 --> 01:51:56.673
Before that, l"ll take the
rest of your family away from you.

01:51:56.964 --> 01:52:01.088
You like to save people
from being killed by me, right?

01:52:01.795 --> 01:52:03.181
To interfere.

01:52:03.810 --> 01:52:05.753
But you have a strange talent.

01:52:06.939 --> 01:52:08.467
You save the outsiders...

01:52:09.615 --> 01:52:11.001
...but not your family.

01:52:24.108 --> 01:52:26.881
Send police to Aisha"s
father"s house immediately.

01:52:26.958 --> 01:52:28.866
Rakesh has come to know who l am.

01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:31.854
Save him. l"ll do whatever you want.
just save him.

01:52:53.026 --> 01:52:54.026
Tell me.

01:52:58.449 --> 01:52:59.516
Sawant!

01:52:59.978 --> 01:53:01.708
Stop! Where are you going? Stop!

01:53:01.785 --> 01:53:03.338
Where are you going?

01:53:04.183 --> 01:53:06.542
Stop! - Stop!

01:53:06.617 --> 01:53:09.733
Hey! Leave him. Let him come.

01:53:18.921 --> 01:53:19.921
Don"t kill me.

01:53:58.056 --> 01:54:04.515
Sir, before Guru finds me
and kills me, l want to surrender.

01:54:08.032 --> 01:54:09.205
Where are you right now?

01:54:21.483 --> 01:54:23.983
l"ve seen many rogues
in my career as a policeman.

01:54:24.333 --> 01:54:26.333
But l"ve never come
across such an insolent before.

01:54:28.469 --> 01:54:29.997
lf he gets away because of me...

01:54:31.319 --> 01:54:33.605
...then neither God, nor
l will be able to forgive myself.

01:54:36.150 --> 01:54:37.986
l"ve always been
an obstacle for you.

01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:41.532
l"ve been the villain of your life.

01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:44.768
But l"m saying this to you today.

01:54:45.882 --> 01:54:48.797
Go and kill him.

01:54:51.061 --> 01:54:53.941
He"s taking shelter in the
place where he committed the crime.

01:54:55.615 --> 01:54:57.724
He"s in Aisha and your house.

01:55:11.429 --> 01:55:12.922
Aisha was wrong.

01:55:18.936 --> 01:55:23.689
l fought death and
got life back for Aisha.

01:55:24.393 --> 01:55:26.928
l got light back into my life.

01:55:30.128 --> 01:55:34.323
But by killing her,
you"ve spread darkness again.

01:55:38.678 --> 01:55:40.029
Aisha was wrong.

01:55:41.806 --> 01:55:44.579
No lamp can bring
light into this darkness.

01:55:44.656 --> 01:55:47.643
Only the fire of your
pyre can bring light back.

01:55:51.225 --> 01:55:52.540
Aisha was wrong.

01:55:54.319 --> 01:55:55.942
Aisha was wrong.

01:55:57.273 --> 01:55:58.552
Aisha was wrong.

01:56:06.483 --> 01:56:10.228
Please let me go!
Please forgive me! Please!

01:56:10.828 --> 01:56:12.807
Please forgive me! Please!

01:56:12.879 --> 01:56:16.280
Please forgive me!
Please forgive me!

01:56:26.295 --> 01:56:29.838
This is what you
wanted to hear, right?

01:56:29.909 --> 01:56:33.547
You wanted me to beg for my
life just as your Aisha did. Right?

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.755
l won"t.

01:56:37.382 --> 01:56:40.819
What did you think?
That you found me here?

01:56:41.935 --> 01:56:42.421
No.

01:56:42.492 --> 01:56:45.229
l brought you here.

01:56:46.106 --> 01:56:47.978
l called that policeman.

01:56:48.435 --> 01:56:52.702
l knew that you would get
furious on knowing my whereabouts.

01:56:54.796 --> 01:56:57.782
The place where l killed your wife...

01:56:58.932 --> 01:57:01.563
l knew you would come running to me.

01:57:01.851 --> 01:57:04.838
l made you what l could never be.

01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:06.439
Employee of the year.

01:57:06.509 --> 01:57:07.860
My employee.

01:57:11.063 --> 01:57:14.843
lf the police had caught me,
l would go to prison.

01:57:16.658 --> 01:57:18.530
All my crimes would be proved.

01:57:19.369 --> 01:57:21.419
My Sulo would have hated me.

01:57:21.490 --> 01:57:24.820
The end of my love story
wouldn"t have been a happy one.

01:57:32.333 --> 01:57:34.028
Take this. Take it.

01:57:34.453 --> 01:57:35.453
Kill me.

01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:37.056
You"ll kill me...

01:57:37.581 --> 01:57:42.476
...and l"ll become
a hero for my Sulo.

01:57:43.455 --> 01:57:44.485
Kill me!

01:57:46.409 --> 01:57:48.554
Please don"t kill me!

01:57:49.017 --> 01:57:50.604
l want to live!

01:57:51.102 --> 01:57:53.117
l"m pregnant!

01:57:53.986 --> 01:57:56.901
l want to give birth to my baby!

01:57:57.532 --> 01:57:59.298
l"m pregnant!

01:58:04.901 --> 01:58:05.901
Look at this.

01:58:06.534 --> 01:58:10.634
You and l are like twin brothers
who were separated in childhood.

01:58:11.088 --> 01:58:12.095
We"re the same.

01:58:12.686 --> 01:58:16.645
You want to kill me for your wife.

01:58:16.718 --> 01:58:20.818
And l was killing
everyone for my wife.

01:58:24.434 --> 01:58:29.151
You have no idea what
A big favour you"ve done on me.

01:58:29.230 --> 01:58:30.782
Because of your revenge story...

01:58:31.385 --> 01:58:36.386
...my Sulo said in front
of everyone that she loves me.

01:58:37.538 --> 01:58:38.959
Thank you, my friend.

01:58:44.384 --> 01:58:46.434
Hello, Guru,
Sir wants to talk to you.

01:58:49.494 --> 01:58:52.029
l threw your wife from here.

01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:53.130
Throw me down.

01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:55.503
Avenge your wife"s death.

01:58:56.167 --> 01:58:59.319
Kill me. Let me win.

01:58:59.399 --> 01:59:02.516
Let me be the hero of
this story and be the villain!

01:59:03.083 --> 01:59:04.083
Rakesh!

01:59:04.508 --> 01:59:05.539
My husband is not here.

01:59:05.899 --> 01:59:07.973
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

01:59:08.054 --> 01:59:10.721
Mother! - Manish!
Where are you taking my son?

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:11.973
Mother!
- Leave him!

01:59:12.051 --> 01:59:13.544
Mother!
- Manish!

01:59:13.615 --> 01:59:14.266
Leave him.

01:59:14.345 --> 01:59:15.589
Why are you doing this to us?

01:59:16.188 --> 01:59:19.304
Please spare my son!
l beg of you!

01:59:19.384 --> 01:59:20.384
Guru.

01:59:21.366 --> 01:59:23.617
Rakesh killed your wife.

01:59:24.424 --> 01:59:26.474
What have we done to you?
- l"ll kill his wife.

01:59:26.545 --> 01:59:29.116
Sulo! - Please spare my son!
For God"s sake!

01:59:29.186 --> 01:59:30.739
Rakesh! - Leave me.

01:59:34.817 --> 01:59:37.032
Please spare my son! For God"s sake!

01:59:37.110 --> 01:59:38.010
Spare my son.

01:59:38.084 --> 01:59:40.099
Let go off her.

01:59:40.170 --> 01:59:42.244
Sulo! Sulo!
- Rakesh.

01:59:42.324 --> 01:59:46.483
Sulo! - Let her go.
- Help! Rakesh.

01:59:46.565 --> 01:59:50.795
Sulo! Sulo! Sulo!
- Manish!

01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:52.888
Sulo! - Manish.

01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:54.133
Spare my son.

01:59:54.211 --> 01:59:55.704
Please spare him...

01:59:55.775 --> 01:59:58.098
Manish - Spare him.

01:59:58.174 --> 01:59:59.940
Please.. please spare him.

02:00:00.016 --> 02:00:02.967
Rakesh! Rakesh! - Sulo!

02:00:03.492 --> 02:00:05.044
Sulo! - Mummy!

02:00:08.531 --> 02:00:09.633
Sulo...

02:00:11.485 --> 02:00:12.943
Sulo...

02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:18.046
Now, it "s his son" s turn.

02:00:18.784 --> 02:00:21.699
But you "ll kill him. l won" t.

02:00:23.303 --> 02:00:27.261
l"m waiting for you
at Rakesh"s house, Guru.

02:00:28.307 --> 02:00:29.374
Come. - Sulo.

02:00:29.942 --> 02:00:31.328
Come home, Guru.

02:00:40.333 --> 02:00:44.564
You killed my Sulo.
You killed my Sulo!

02:00:46.103 --> 02:00:52.313
You killed my Sulo!
You killed Sulo.

02:00:52.395 --> 02:00:54.824
You killed Sulo.

02:01:03.621 --> 02:01:07.650
You killed my Sulo!

02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:10.601
On this road...

02:01:12.727 --> 02:01:19.115
...this story began.

02:01:22.424 --> 02:01:24.498
Your wife was right.

02:01:25.309 --> 02:01:28.640
Someone would die over here someday.

02:01:29.793 --> 02:01:31.380
On this road...

02:01:31.461 --> 02:01:33.014
...l"ll kill you...

02:01:33.547 --> 02:01:39.033
...and bring an end...

02:01:39.976 --> 02:01:43.792
...to this story.

02:01:53.775 --> 02:01:55.268
Who did this?

02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:56.548
l. l didn"t do it.

02:01:56.625 --> 02:01:58.391
Can"t you drive properly?

02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:00.165
There was a pothole.

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:01.554
Car lost its balance.

02:02:02.186 --> 02:02:04.058
What happened?

02:02:04.132 --> 02:02:06.455
He is dead.

02:02:30.374 --> 02:02:31.997
"Darkness cannot
drive out darkness."

02:02:33.224 --> 02:02:34.882
"Only light can do that."

02:02:39.238 --> 02:02:40.659
"Hate cannot drive out hate."

02:02:41.635 --> 02:02:43.188
"Only love can do that."

02:02:47.057 --> 02:02:50.079
"That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear..."

02:02:51.090 --> 02:02:52.582
"...is still over there."

02:02:59.292 --> 02:03:01.401
"He only needs someone"s hand."

02:03:04.505 --> 02:03:05.892
"Someone"s support."

02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:15.901
"Someone who can pull him out of the
darkness and bring him to light."

02:03:25.151 --> 02:03:27.686
"Unless we share
someone else"s pain..."

02:03:28.557 --> 02:03:32.895
"...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain."

02:04:33.970 --> 02:04:35.356
Do you want to hear a joke?

02:04:38.036 --> 02:04:39.529
Once, there was a beggar.

02:04:40.018 --> 02:04:42.068
He called up in the five star hotel..

02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:43.640
..and ordered for a burger..

02:04:44.153 --> 02:04:46.748
..pizza and sweet dish.

02:04:47.733 --> 02:04:48.835
