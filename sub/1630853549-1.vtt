01:18.995 --> 01:22.707
[cheers and applause]

01:27.879 --> 01:28.755
Hey.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.466
Hello. Wow.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.802
Thanks.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.428
Thank you.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.891
Alright.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.978
So how's your year going?

01:44.854 --> 01:46.272
Good?

01:46.356 --> 01:49.984
I've had a really weird year.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.865
I had an AIDS scare this year.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.912
Yeah, I did, and you're like, "Pete,
wow, what's going on in your life?

02:00.995 --> 02:03.832
Are you sharing needles?
You doing heroin?

02:03.915 --> 02:06.793
Are you having tons
of unprotected sex?"

02:07.752 --> 02:09.712
No, Kanye told me I had AIDS.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.301
And uh...
And he's a...

02:15.385 --> 02:18.263
He's a genius, so I was like,
"Oh, fuck."

02:20.306 --> 02:22.642
I was like,
"I better call my doctor."

02:23.309 --> 02:26.521
The guy who made <i>College Dropout</i>
thinks I have AIDS.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.567
So I went to the doctor,
I actually got checked.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.819
Because I was like,
"Maybe he's right, I don't know."

02:34.445 --> 02:35.655
I was like, "I don't know."

02:36.114 --> 02:38.449
So my doctor told me,
I don't have AIDS,

02:38.533 --> 02:40.577
I just look like I have it, so...

02:41.077 --> 02:43.037
it's a completely different thing.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.832
You know what's really funny
about that?

02:45.915 --> 02:50.086
AIDS is just such an old school
thing, like, "You have AIDS."

02:50.712 --> 02:54.549
It's just such a '90s,
early-2000s thing to...

02:55.550 --> 02:56.801
You know what I mean?

02:57.427 --> 02:59.762
John Mulaney called me,
he's like, "AIDS?

02:59.846 --> 03:02.682
You should spread a rumor
that he has polio!"

03:07.645 --> 03:11.149
Does anybody else secretly hope
that Kanye pulls, like a...

03:11.608 --> 03:13.026
<i>Mrs. Doubtfire?</i>

03:19.365 --> 03:20.491
They come home one day,

03:20.575 --> 03:22.160
and they're like,
"This is the new housekeeper,"

03:22.243 --> 03:23.953
and he's like,
"What's up, fam?"

03:28.416 --> 03:32.462
Yeah, it's a really weird thing
to go through.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.924
There's-- because you know,
people try to give you advice,

03:36.007 --> 03:39.677
but even friends that are older,
they're like, "I don't... know."

03:41.471 --> 03:43.973
He's like, "It looks pretty bad, bro,
I hope...

03:44.724 --> 03:48.561
Good luck, sorry, here if you need,"
but like, no advice.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.438
No one was like,
"This is what you do."

03:50.521 --> 03:52.315
Everyone was like,
"I don't know... yeah.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.568
You staying with your mom?
You in a safe spot?"

03:59.530 --> 04:01.157
People ask me weird questions.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.619
So that's the only thing I don't
like. They ask this weird stuff.

04:04.702 --> 04:06.996
Like the other day, somebody
came up to me and was like,

04:07.080 --> 04:10.250
"I heard you're friends
with Jack Harlow!"

04:10.333 --> 04:13.920
And I am. He's a very great,
talented rapper. He's a cool dude.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.922
Nice guy. So we're pals, right?

04:16.005 --> 04:19.425
And Kanye put him on his new album.

04:20.551 --> 04:24.264
Even though I've been friends
with him for like two, three years,

04:24.847 --> 04:28.017
you know, he did it anyway.
People come up to me and they're like,

04:28.101 --> 04:30.645
"How does that make you feel?
Does that bother you?

04:30.728 --> 04:33.231
Does that get under your skin?"

04:34.023 --> 04:36.776
And I'm like, "No, he's a rapper."

04:38.152 --> 04:40.905
That's his field,
that's what they do.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.323
That doesn't hurt my feelings.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.618
It would hurt my feelings if I saw,
like, Bill Burr at Sunday service.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.206
I'd be like, "What the fuck, Bill?"
He'd be like,

04:50.290 --> 04:52.625
"Find God, Petey, go fuck yourself!

04:53.459 --> 04:55.086
Jesus!"

04:58.006 --> 05:00.925
Yeah, I don't get it.
A lot of people are very angry.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.137
It's always 50-50 when I go outside.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.890
Yeah, it is. It's always 50-50.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.643
Either someone's just like, "Hey, man,
you're really cool, that's great."

05:10.727 --> 05:13.021
Or someone's like,
"Hey, yo! Fuck you!

05:13.813 --> 05:15.565
Fuck you!

05:16.899 --> 05:18.234
Yeah, you!"

05:18.735 --> 05:20.653
I always am like, "Can't be me."

05:24.407 --> 05:26.743
It's weird, it's all weird because...

05:26.826 --> 05:31.622
right before, December 2021,
I call it "the before time".

05:32.999 --> 05:35.251
Before my life was ruined,
it was like...

05:35.835 --> 05:37.253
Yeah, it's like COVID happened

05:37.337 --> 05:40.131
and then another COVID happened
personally to me.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.927
That was a really good month,
December 2021.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.556
I remember, I went to a Knicks game
with my good pals,

05:48.639 --> 05:50.183
Jon Stewart and Chris Rock, right?

05:50.266 --> 05:52.810
So we went to this Knicks game...
Yeah, they're the best.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.438
And very hilarious
that they hang out with me.

05:56.898 --> 06:00.651
It's really weird. But I'm stoked,
because they're heroes.

06:00.735 --> 06:04.781
So we're watching the game,
and it's the game when Steph Curry

06:05.364 --> 06:08.910
breaks the three-point record, right?

06:08.993 --> 06:10.995
And I remember he broke
the three-point record

06:11.079 --> 06:16.167
in the first quarter, and just
somehow, how we were placed,

06:16.250 --> 06:20.129
because he shot it from over there
and me, Jon, and Chris

06:20.213 --> 06:22.006
were under the basket. So like,

06:22.090 --> 06:23.800
in the picture
that everybody put out,

06:23.883 --> 06:26.803
that's like here's him
breaking the record,

06:26.886 --> 06:28.346
us three are just, like...

06:28.429 --> 06:29.597
Like, we all look...

06:29.931 --> 06:33.392
We completely photobombed his,
whatever, basketball card

06:33.476 --> 06:35.144
that's going to be, like, forever.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.649
And it was such a good night,
but it's so weird because since then,

06:39.732 --> 06:42.819
horrible things have happened
to me and Chris.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.826
So Jon Stewart,
if you're watching...

06:50.785 --> 06:52.537
watch your fucking back.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.791
Lucky bastard.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.836
It's like Chris gets slapped,
I get decapitated,

06:59.919 --> 07:02.588
then Jon Stewart wins
the Mark Twain award.

07:07.009 --> 07:07.969
So...

07:08.636 --> 07:09.804
I haven't been on stage much,

07:09.887 --> 07:13.850
but I've been trying to make a joke
about Epstein's plane funny.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.478
That's usually how it goes.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.691
In any room that I ever pitch
this joke on.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.486
But I just, like...
hear me out.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.032
The guy, obviously, bad dude.
You got to get that out of the way.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.784
Bad dude, shouldn't do that stuff.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.496
But I didn't understand why people
were mad at all the dudes

07:35.580 --> 07:38.791
that took a free plane ride.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.879
Like, the Jeffery Epstein doc came out

07:42.962 --> 07:44.005
and this dude raped

07:44.088 --> 07:47.049
and did a bunch of terrible stuff
to little young girls,

07:47.133 --> 07:48.342
and then people would be like,

07:48.426 --> 07:51.262
"Can you believe Chris Tucker
rode on that plane?"

07:52.763 --> 07:55.475
It's like, "Yeah, have you ever tried
to fly commercial?

07:55.558 --> 07:58.853
From fucking L.A. to New York?
It's a fucking nightmare."

08:00.188 --> 08:03.941
Because I've been in situations now...
Let me rephrase that.

08:05.359 --> 08:09.447
I know a dude who gives me
free plane rides, right?

08:09.530 --> 08:11.032
I don't really know what he does,

08:11.115 --> 08:13.701
he tells me he's
in the "waste management" business.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.371
That's what he says, "I'm in waste
management. I'm a garbageman."

08:17.455 --> 08:20.541
I go, "Yeah, tons of garbagemen
have private jets, so..."

08:21.501 --> 08:25.546
But I just don't ask.
I'm just like, "Okay, whatever."

08:27.340 --> 08:29.175
Because I don't think
there's anything wrong

08:29.258 --> 08:30.927
with taking the plane with a guy.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.764
You don't have to support
what the guy does.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.809
So I fly with one pedophile, right?

08:38.893 --> 08:43.439
If you fly commercial, there's
at least, like, five pedophiles.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.947
And you don't know who they are.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.991
I know who mine is,
it's right in front of me

08:54.742 --> 08:57.161
with a mimosa
and some strawberry chocolates.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.666
Thank you guys for being out here.
You guys ready to start?

09:01.749 --> 09:03.793

they look away,
but point directly at...

10:38.220 --> 10:39.847
Right? That's wack.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.558
I like when they go,
"Yo, I don't care who you are..."

10:42.642 --> 10:45.019
And I'm like, "Then why the fuck...?"

10:45.102 --> 10:48.189
They'll be like, "Yo, my friends

Neko White!

11:24.433 --> 11:26.352
L.A., one more time
for Pete Davidson,

11:26.435 --> 11:28.771
give him a round of applause, huh?

11:29.855 --> 11:30.815
Yes!

11:31.857 --> 11:33.818
Pleasure to be
in front of y'all tonight.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.570
My name is Neko White.
I made a very simple goal.

11:36.654 --> 11:41.325
And that is to mind my business
at the highest level possible.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.120
Now, I take this very seriously.
You guys in here tonight,

11:44.203 --> 11:46.539
I appreciate that,
while you're in here.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.165
Once we get outside,

11:48.249 --> 11:50.167
whatever happens to you...

11:50.501 --> 11:52.878
is not my business,
you understand me?

11:52.962 --> 11:55.673
If we in here, we cool.
You outside, you get robbed,

11:55.756 --> 11:57.925
you see me, don't make eye contact.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.802
Because I'm telling you now,
if you look at me,

11:59.885 --> 12:02.680
"Neko, help!" Hey, man,
it was a good show, I'ma holler at you.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.266
I mind my business.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.184
Now recently,
I went to get a haircut.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.936
As soon as I walked
into the barber shop,

12:09.019 --> 12:10.646
my barber goes, "Hey, man.

12:10.729 --> 12:13.107
You see this shit
with Dwyane Wade's son?"

12:13.649 --> 12:14.692
"No.

12:15.693 --> 12:19.321
That's not my business.
I got bills, bro.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.198
I got a whole real life."

12:21.282 --> 12:24.827
Do you understand that where I live,
I have a crackhead doorman?

12:26.078 --> 12:29.999
And where I live,
we don't hire doormen.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.420
This lady just showed up one day.

12:34.503 --> 12:39.341
She held the door for one person,
and she's been back every day since.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.051
And what pisses me off

12:41.135 --> 12:43.345
is that she has a custom greeting
just for me.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.097
When I walk in the building,
she goes,

12:45.181 --> 12:49.602
"Mr. Neko White. Ow, ow, ow."
What the fuck does that mean?

12:51.228 --> 12:53.731
"Ow, ow, ow"? I don't speak
crack Morse code,

12:53.814 --> 12:55.483
what are you saying to me?

12:56.066 --> 12:59.069
So no, I don't know what's going on
with Dwyane Wade

12:59.153 --> 13:00.946
or his rich-ass kid.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.116
I said that, my barber go,
"Nah.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.243
See, Dwyane Wade had a son

13:06.619 --> 13:08.370
that was born a boy,

13:08.454 --> 13:09.955
but now, at 11 years old,

13:10.039 --> 13:13.542
his son say,
'I'm a woman on the inside.'

13:13.626 --> 13:17.755
So now when he get older,
he goin' to chop his dick off.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.966
And he gonna become a woman.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.594
Now ain't that shit weird?"

13:26.347 --> 13:28.516
"I'm here for a fade, man.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.270
Little off the side,

13:34.271 --> 13:35.523
square in the back.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.483
What are you doing right now?

13:37.566 --> 13:40.277
Do you realize that it's only
10:02 in the morning?

13:40.361 --> 13:41.403
Do you know that?

13:42.238 --> 13:44.823
Do you know I smoked the Sativa
before I came here?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.242
Do you know that?

13:46.325 --> 13:49.119
Do you know how paranoid
I am right now?

13:49.745 --> 13:52.665
And you're going to ask me
that cancelable-ass question?

13:53.582 --> 13:56.544
In front of all these mirrors
in this barber shop?

13:57.044 --> 14:00.923
Do you know how many 'mes' I see
in either direction right now?

14:01.173 --> 14:03.759
I'm here for a fade, man.

14:03.842 --> 14:07.263
Little off the side,
square in the back."

14:07.846 --> 14:12.476
My barber didn't flinch.
"Ain't that shit weird?"

14:14.144 --> 14:15.563
"Yeah.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.647
Yeah, it's weird...

14:16.730 --> 14:19.358
that you know what an 11-year-old
that you're not related to

14:19.441 --> 14:21.735
want to do with their dick.
That's very weird.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.822
I'm just saying.
I have a nephew that's 11.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.449
Know what I know about him?
He 11, and that's where it stops.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.951
I don't know nothing extra.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.079
I don't know his name,
I don't know his birthday,

14:32.705 --> 14:35.791
and I don't know his dick
aspirations. But he 11."

14:36.876 --> 14:41.422
When I said that, my barber goes,
"Alright, Mr. Holier-Than-Thou.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.842
What if it was your son?"

14:46.927 --> 14:49.054
"What if it was my son?

14:49.138 --> 14:51.599
I'd still need a fade.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.564
But you want to play
hypotheticals with me?

14:58.647 --> 15:01.942
I do that all day, brother!
Let's do that!"

15:02.401 --> 15:03.944
What if it was my son?

15:04.028 --> 15:05.279
I could see that.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.324
I could see me walking to my son's room,
knocking on his door.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.495
"Hey, baby boy, look here.
Your papa's tired.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.623
Would you mind taking the garbage
out for me, Big Dog?

15:15.706 --> 15:16.832
I'd really appreciate that."

15:17.499 --> 15:20.586
"Dad?"
"Yeah, what's going on?"

15:21.211 --> 15:22.713
[whimpering softly]

15:23.631 --> 15:25.966
You know when a kid really think
they telling you something?

15:26.050 --> 15:27.301
[whimpering softly]

15:30.054 --> 15:31.639
"Dad, um...

15:32.348 --> 15:34.725
I'm a woman on the inside."

15:37.603 --> 15:39.730
"I just asked you
to take out the garbage.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.901
Did you know it was only 10:02
in the morning right now?

15:43.984 --> 15:44.902
Did you know that?

15:45.819 --> 15:48.697
You know I smoked the Sativa
before I came in here.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.535
You ever notice how many
mirrors you got in your room?

15:56.830 --> 15:58.457
I'll be right back, kid."

15:58.540 --> 15:59.875
[imitates door closing]

16:00.459 --> 16:02.002
[exhales] Okay.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.299
"Hey, baby girl, would you mind
taking that garbage out

16:07.383 --> 16:09.009
for your papa?"

16:12.096 --> 16:13.389
L.A., you've been excellent.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.392
My name's Neko White.
Thank you!

16:16.475 --> 16:19.019
[cheers and applause]

16:19.103 --> 16:21.981
Now then, you ready for more show?

16:23.065 --> 16:24.525
I don't think you can hear me.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.027
Are you ready for more show?

16:28.112 --> 16:30.781
Coming to the stage is a very dear
friend of mine

16:30.864 --> 16:32.866
from New York City.
Y'all, put your hands together

16:32.950 --> 16:36.328
for Giulio Gallarotti!

16:36.912 --> 16:39.540
[cheers and applause]

16:39.623 --> 16:42.584
One more time for Neko, guys!
Let him hear it.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.545
[cheers and applause]

16:45.754 --> 16:47.673
-Yeah.
-Sound about right?

16:47.756 --> 16:49.967
Yeah, that sounds good. Good.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.260
Feeling good.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.637
You know, comedians travel a lot.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.140
So we see a lot of crazy stuff.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.226
I saw something on a plane
the other day

16:59.309 --> 17:01.937
that I couldn't believe was
on a plane.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.773
Just a guy... with a falcon.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.319
And it wasn't in a cage,
just on his arm.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.823
And I was like,
"How is that allowed on a plane?

17:12.906 --> 17:16.076
You can just bring a falcon
on a plane?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.871
I can't bring four ounces of water
on a plane.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.751
But I can bring a falcon?
Birds of prey? No problem."

17:24.668 --> 17:26.045
That's crazy.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.671
I started thinking about it,
and I'm like,

17:27.755 --> 17:32.468
the idea of a falcon
having to fly in a plane.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.891
The flight was only an hour!

17:39.433 --> 17:42.019
The falcon can easily fly there
on its own.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.856
I was convinced that right
before we actually got on the plane,

17:45.939 --> 17:48.275
the guy was just going to be like,
"Alright dude, see you there."

17:51.945 --> 17:53.238
How is this allowed?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.908
When I saw the falcon,
I was making a video.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.118
I made sure I got the falcon in there
with a cameo.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.370
I was editing that video
for two or three months,

18:00.454 --> 18:02.581
and I was just looking at myself
every day,

18:02.664 --> 18:05.084
and I just started hating
the way that I look.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.171
Specifically, I was a little
heavier too, in the video.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.091
My body...
I was just not that down. [gags]

18:13.008 --> 18:15.844
I don't gain weight
in a masculine way.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.598
When I gain weight,
it immediately just starts to be like...

18:22.184 --> 18:23.894
I start to get all curvy!

18:25.062 --> 18:27.147
I feel like as a guy, you don't want
your descriptive word

18:27.231 --> 18:28.774
to be "voluptuous."

18:30.776 --> 18:32.611
Oh yeah, G's thick, dude.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.240
It's crazy.
It's amazing, like,

18:36.323 --> 18:39.243
if you can see yourself on a video,
that's a great way to know that

18:39.326 --> 18:40.369
you've gained weight.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.912
But otherwise, how do you find out?

18:41.995 --> 18:44.957
Typically,
your rudest friend will tell you.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.543
Which is a crazy thing
to be doing.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.378
I'll never forget
the last time this happened to me,

18:49.461 --> 18:50.504
I went to visit one of my friends,

18:50.587 --> 18:53.757
and the person who told me I'd gained
weight was the guy who mows his lawn.

18:54.258 --> 18:58.220
He's a very nice guy,
but doesn't speak English at all.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.223
But still, he was able
to convey to me

19:02.349 --> 19:04.184
that he thought I'd gained weight.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.769
Which I'll never forget.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.312
Because I show up,
I'm like, "Hey, what's up?"

19:07.396 --> 19:09.148
He goes, "Papi..."

19:13.652 --> 19:14.695
And I was in denial,

19:14.778 --> 19:17.489
I was like, "Maybe he just thinks
I look strong or something."

19:17.906 --> 19:21.410
I don't know how one could ever think
that this means strong.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.912
So I just said,
"Oh, thank you, papi."

19:25.455 --> 19:27.875
And he made sure to clarify.
He goes, "No, papi..."

19:28.792 --> 19:31.545
And to make sure there was
no mistake in my brain,

19:31.628 --> 19:35.090
he just starts going...
[lips smacking]

19:35.924 --> 19:37.718
I'm like, "Dude, you're a dick."

19:38.552 --> 19:39.511
Isn't that sad?

19:39.595 --> 19:42.055
I don't know. I can't imagine
ever saying some shit like that

19:42.139 --> 19:43.348
to somebody's face.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.767
I would at least wait for them
to leave the room.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.438
Then I'd be like,
"Man, he looks terrible."

19:50.856 --> 19:52.649
I say "bro" a lot when I talk,

19:52.733 --> 19:54.735
and then sometimes
I get self-conscious

19:54.818 --> 19:56.528
that I'm going to get grouped in
with a group of people

19:56.612 --> 19:58.488
that I feel
like I shouldn't be associated with.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.201
You know,
rambunctious, young white men.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.914
I'm like-- to the point
to where I see a group of bros,

20:06.997 --> 20:08.332
I actually get disgusted.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.709
I'm like, "Look at these...
fucking bros."

20:11.752 --> 20:13.670
It can ruin my mood.
I went to dinner,

20:13.754 --> 20:16.506
it was a sushi restaurant that I was
really looking forward to going to eat at.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.801
It was fancy. I sit down.
They seat me next to these bros.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.512
And I'm looking over there like,
"Look at these fucking bros."

20:23.180 --> 20:25.390
They're not even going
to appreciate this meal.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.643
They're going to be ordering shit
that isn't even on the menu.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.353
"Can we get some sake bombs?"

20:30.020 --> 20:31.897
Their dads are probably paying.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.690
Dude, fuck this.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.068
So I was like, "You know what?
I'm going to monitor them.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.279
To make sure
they're being well-behaved."

20:40.489 --> 20:42.407
I don't know what power I have. Just...

20:42.991 --> 20:44.493
to prove myself right.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.620
And as it turns out,

20:46.703 --> 20:47.788
these bros,

20:47.871 --> 20:49.414
were wonderful gentlemen.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.376
They were great guys.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.544
I swear,
they were mild-mannered and polite,

20:54.628 --> 20:56.797
compassionate with the waitstaff.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.466
They were engaging
in thought-provoking conversation.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.262
While maintaining their
inside voices the entire time.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.056
I was like,
"These bros were raised right.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.309
These bros are pros."

21:11.728 --> 21:13.522
Seriously, it was as if these bros

21:13.605 --> 21:15.482
had achieved the
next level of "bro-dom".

21:16.191 --> 21:17.526
Which I didn't even know
was possible.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.945
You guys probably think that
perhaps they weren't bros at all.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.407
But they were, because they were
still doing all the shit that bros do,

21:23.490 --> 21:26.702
but just in a much more classy
and sophisticated manner.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.996
I'll give you the best example.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.789
A plate of sushi comes over.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.625
One of the bros scoops up a piece,
perfect chopstick work.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.920
And then he takes a bite,

21:37.004 --> 21:39.089
and he just started really
earnestly enjoying it.

21:39.172 --> 21:42.259
And then he said the most bro thing
you could ever say,

21:42.342 --> 21:44.761
but in a much more classy
and refined way.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.388
So I'll never forget, he's like,

21:48.807 --> 21:50.100
"Fire."

21:53.562 --> 21:54.980
"Fire."

21:55.063 --> 21:58.150
I said, "Send some sake bombs
over there on me, dude.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.401
This bro's awesome."

21:59.484 --> 22:01.903
Guys, thank you very much,
I really appreciate it.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.239
Aw, it was super fun.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.741
You guys ready for the next comedian?

22:05.824 --> 22:08.076
If you make some noise, I'll bring
her out, make some noise!

22:08.160 --> 22:09.661
[cheers and applause]

22:10.162 --> 22:12.039
Guys, the next comedian coming
to the stage, she's amazing.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.582
One of my best friends.
I love her.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.209
Please give it up
for Carly Aquilino!

22:16.293 --> 22:18.045
[cheers and applause]

22:21.173 --> 22:22.674
Wow!

22:23.133 --> 22:27.429
Thank you, oh my God,
thank you guys so much!

22:27.971 --> 22:30.057
How's everybody feeling, good?

22:30.766 --> 22:32.642
Good, we love it.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.145
Did you guys hear
there's a new variant?

22:35.228 --> 22:37.314
We don't care, right?
None of us?

22:37.397 --> 22:39.566
We're all here,
we're having fun.

22:39.649 --> 22:40.859
I did all the things.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.528
Anytime they tell me there's
a new variant, I'm like,

22:43.612 --> 22:46.907
"Okay, I got the vaccines"
when I still wasn't sure

22:46.990 --> 22:48.408
about the vaccines. Like,

22:49.076 --> 22:51.453
I trusted the vaccines blindly.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.371
My friends were like,
"I trust science!"

22:53.455 --> 22:55.957
I'm like, "I don't know science
at all. I'm sorry.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.335
Never learned it.
Don't know anything about it."

22:59.586 --> 23:02.297
I'm kind of dealing with the vaccine
the way I deal with men in my life.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.466
I'm like, "I'll do this, but...

23:06.760 --> 23:09.012
I won't be surprised...

23:09.513 --> 23:11.348
if I end up regretting it."

23:13.850 --> 23:16.186
I miss a lot of things
about the lockdown.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.854
Is that bad to say?

23:17.938 --> 23:19.564
-[audience] No!
-No!

23:19.648 --> 23:22.400
I took seven walks a day.

23:23.151 --> 23:26.613
I miss those videos that went viral
every single day

23:26.696 --> 23:29.366
of just a woman that didn't
want to wear her mask.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.162
I love that lady,
I love them.

23:35.038 --> 23:37.040
It was always the same thing, too.

23:37.124 --> 23:40.085
It was just some lady like,
"You can't tell me..."

23:41.294 --> 23:43.839
I'm sorry that she's Southern.
It's just...

23:44.422 --> 23:46.591
that she was always Southern.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.930
"You can't tell me what to do."

23:54.182 --> 23:55.475
And the other person was just like,

23:55.559 --> 23:59.771
"Ma'am, this is a Long John Silver's
and... you're not wearing any shoes."

23:59.855 --> 24:01.148
I...

24:02.440 --> 24:05.735
I went through a lot, kind of,
during the lockdown.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.947
I'm 31 now but I turned
30 during the whole thing.

24:09.030 --> 24:09.990
Thank you!

24:10.448 --> 24:13.493
Wow, are you guys all 30?
Like, every single one of you?

24:13.577 --> 24:14.661
That's cool.

24:15.328 --> 24:16.621
I went through this thing, though,

24:16.705 --> 24:20.333
where I thought about where I would
be at this point in my life.

24:20.417 --> 24:24.421
Like, what I would have thought
as a teenager. Do you ever do that?

24:24.504 --> 24:26.423
It messes me up.
Like, if you would have asked me

24:26.506 --> 24:28.091
at 15 years old,

24:28.175 --> 24:30.051
I would be like,
"Um, okay.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.054
First of all, here's the stuff
that's going to happen.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.765
31, ew, that's disgusting, but...

24:36.892 --> 24:39.186
So, I'm definitely going
to get married when I'm 20.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.355
For sure. That's happening.

24:42.772 --> 24:44.941
And then, I'm just going to go
to Europe

24:46.693 --> 24:47.986
for five years,

24:48.862 --> 24:50.405
because that
doesn't cost any money.

24:50.488 --> 24:51.448
That's free.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.743
And then by the time I'm 31,
I'm going to have three kids,

24:54.826 --> 24:57.037
just be a stay-at-home mom."

24:58.705 --> 25:01.333
And now I'm 31, and I'm always like,
"Do I have...

25:01.416 --> 25:04.794
two tampons in right now?"
I don't even know...

25:05.128 --> 25:06.588
I don't even know where they go.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.506
Honestly. I...

25:09.633 --> 25:11.801
I have no way...
I lose them constantly.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.345
I have no idea where they are.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.014
That's my biggest fear
as a grown woman.

25:16.097 --> 25:17.349
Can you imagine?

25:19.017 --> 25:20.560
By the way, that happened to me.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.230
And I don't want to talk about it,
but I'll tell you guys everything.

25:23.313 --> 25:26.191
So I went to go to the bathroom.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.818
And I pull my pants down
and I look down,

25:28.902 --> 25:32.822
and I saw two strings.

25:33.406 --> 25:34.908
And I was like... [gasps]

25:36.826 --> 25:39.120
"Am I a ceiling fan? Why...?

25:45.085 --> 25:48.546
Why exactly are there two strings
coming out of my body right now?"

25:49.965 --> 25:51.216
I don't know if you guys know this,

25:51.299 --> 25:53.802
anything more than one string
is classified as an emergency.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.012
That's bad, it's a bad vibe.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.642
I had to go to the doctor.
My poor gyno, this poor woman,

26:00.725 --> 26:02.269
I feel so bad for her.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.646
She hates me,
I know that she does.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.650
I'm always going to her with problems
that I make up, like,

26:09.109 --> 26:10.735
I always think I'm pregnant.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.154
Every single month
I think I'm pregnant.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.282
Even if I don't have sex,
I'm like, "Mm, I don't know,

26:15.365 --> 26:18.285
happened to Mary. It could
definitely happen to me."

26:22.247 --> 26:24.124
The last time I went in to her
for that, she said,

26:24.207 --> 26:27.294
"Let me ask you a question.
The person that you were with,

26:27.377 --> 26:29.713
did he withdraw?"

26:32.132 --> 26:36.344
Took me a second, definitely took me
a second to realize what she said.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.888
And then when I figured it out,
I was like, "That was so classy."

26:38.972 --> 26:41.099
Honestly, I felt like a princess.

26:41.182 --> 26:44.477
I was like, "This was really nice
for me. Thank you so much."

26:44.561 --> 26:47.147
I had never heard it said that way.
"Withdraw"?

26:48.565 --> 26:52.736
I was like, "Girl...
he deposits.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.908
He's making a lot
of transactions, and...

27:00.285 --> 27:01.536
it's bad."

27:03.038 --> 27:05.165
I also went through a break-up
during the pandemic

27:05.248 --> 27:06.791
which was kind of crazy.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.336
You know it's bad when
in the middle of a lockdown

27:09.419 --> 27:11.421
somebody looks at you
and they're like, "Hey,

27:11.504 --> 27:13.840
we should see other people."
I was like,

27:13.923 --> 27:17.635
"That's illegal,
but... I get it." You know?

27:20.055 --> 27:22.223
So now I'm dating again,
and it's hard.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.641
You can't do it.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.227
How am I supposed to go out
and meet people?

27:26.311 --> 27:27.729
When I was young, I would worry.

27:27.812 --> 27:30.190
I would worry so much
when I went out with a guy.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.400
I would be like,
"Is he going to kill me?"

27:32.484 --> 27:34.152
And now I would prefer it.

27:34.235 --> 27:39.074
Like "I... I'm done.
No, I'm done. Thank you.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.868
I'm all set. I've seen enough.
I'm done."

27:44.245 --> 27:47.749
I've realized that I have very bad
judgment when it comes to men.

27:47.832 --> 27:51.002
I was at a bar, and I see this guy
at the other end of the bar

27:51.086 --> 27:54.255
and I'm with my friends,
and he had four tattoos on his face.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.467
And I saw it, and I was like,
"I'm going to fix it.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.552
Whatever it is,
I will fix that."

27:59.636 --> 28:01.179
And...

28:01.262 --> 28:03.223
my friends were like,
"I think he's in a gang."

28:03.306 --> 28:05.975
I was like, "I think
you're jealous of me." Like...

28:06.601 --> 28:08.937
"I'm sorry. I have a boyfriend,
you don't. Like...

28:09.437 --> 28:10.897
Girl, if you can't find a man,
just say that."

28:10.980 --> 28:12.232
And that's really how I feel.

28:12.315 --> 28:14.275
I'm sorry,
but it's a lot of jealousy.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.695
But I feel like we don't see
the red flags.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.406
We want to see the good in people.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.492
I always make up excuses for guys.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.868
I'll go out on date,

28:23.952 --> 28:26.454
my friends will be like,
"Hey, how was your first date?"

28:26.538 --> 28:28.706
I'm like, "Um...

28:28.790 --> 28:30.667
[tearfully] well, he made me cry,

28:31.251 --> 28:33.795
and he's definitely a liar,

28:34.963 --> 28:36.256
and I think he's married.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.886
And I think he stole 20 dollars
out of my bag, but...

28:43.346 --> 28:46.141
there's just something about him.
I really do...

28:46.683 --> 28:48.101
I feel good about this."

28:48.685 --> 28:51.062
Thank you guys so much,
you're such a fun crowd.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.897
Are you ready to keep
this show going?

28:54.399 --> 28:56.359
I want you to give a warm welcome

28:56.443 --> 29:00.613
to such a funny guy,
Dave Sirus!

29:00.697 --> 29:03.783
[cheers and applause]

29:05.660 --> 29:07.412
Alright, how you guys doing?

29:09.289 --> 29:10.540
Everything went great.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.753
Great, well, my name's Dave,
I'll be your Jew for the evening.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.715
But honestly, thank you all
so much for being here.

29:18.798 --> 29:21.384
It is so amazing for me to see
all you, to be here,

29:21.801 --> 29:24.387
to see that my friendship with Pete
is finally paying off.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.559
Yeah, I'm Jewish.
I'm also Russian.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.603
So... that's fun now.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.815
Yeah, I'm a Russian Jew,
so you know what that means:

29:35.899 --> 29:37.942
I'm two kinds of untrustworthy.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.364
But honestly though, I feel like even
if Russia had never done anything,

29:43.448 --> 29:46.576
people still wouldn't trust us
just for the accent.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.912
Because like,
when you have a Russian accent,

29:48.995 --> 29:53.041
you kind of always sound like
you're about to lie about something.

29:53.124 --> 29:55.752
It's just taking you a second
to figure it out, like,

29:55.835 --> 29:57.879
the first time I talked to my
landlord, he was like,

29:57.962 --> 30:00.715
[in Russian accent]
"Oh, you should rent this apartment.

30:01.090 --> 30:04.761
Uh, you...

30:06.471 --> 30:07.889
won't be sorry.

30:09.849 --> 30:13.478
Oh, you should meet my daughter.
She is...

30:15.188 --> 30:17.065
[deep sigh]

30:19.567 --> 30:21.069
...beautiful."

30:22.028 --> 30:24.364
[normal voice] So I should tell you guys
a little bit about myself.

30:24.447 --> 30:26.324
I've always been creepy.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.663
That wasn't the joke. I--

30:31.746 --> 30:34.457
No, like honestly, ever since
I was a kid, I was just always

30:34.541 --> 30:36.376
a really weird kid. But like,

30:36.459 --> 30:40.171
I didn't know how weird
everyone else thought I was.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.422
I think that happens
with weird kids.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.634
I didn't even realize how crazy of
a thought it was until I grew up,

30:44.717 --> 30:46.886
and if I was going through
something, my dad would be like,

30:46.970 --> 30:49.639
"Listen, we're just proud of you
for not being a serial killer."

30:50.265 --> 30:52.100
Like wait, what did I do?

30:52.600 --> 30:54.519
So the first clue I ever had

30:54.602 --> 30:56.229
about how weird everyone else
thought I was

30:56.312 --> 30:57.772
was in the seventh grade.

30:57.856 --> 31:01.734
My parents got this letter
from the school board that said,

31:01.818 --> 31:03.319
"Congratulations,

31:04.320 --> 31:07.949
David has been
selected for a very special program

31:08.324 --> 31:10.618
called Life Skills."

31:11.911 --> 31:13.162
And I was so dumb,

31:13.246 --> 31:14.956
I thought this proved I was gifted.

31:15.748 --> 31:18.209
So I go to this week-long program

31:18.751 --> 31:21.963
that's in a building far away
from my normal school.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.506
I open the door,

31:23.590 --> 31:24.924
and this is exactly what happened,

31:25.008 --> 31:28.636
I see there are
two eager grad students

31:29.053 --> 31:32.098
and the nine most fucked-up kids
in my school.

31:33.099 --> 31:36.394
I mean the kids who were caught
smoking, drinking, fucking, fighting,

31:36.477 --> 31:38.813
the girls who got pregnant,
the guy who got them all pregnant,

31:39.314 --> 31:40.481
and me.

31:41.357 --> 31:42.609
Even though, like--

31:43.109 --> 31:46.112
unlike these other kids,
I hadn't really gotten in trouble.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.989
My grades were fine,

31:48.072 --> 31:52.368
I was, and would stay a virgin
for eight more years.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.413
Yet I was in this class
with the dangerous kids.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.290
And it's only now as an adult,

31:57.373 --> 31:59.542
do I finally realize what
was going on.

32:00.209 --> 32:04.172
That I was the scariest kid
in my school.

32:04.964 --> 32:07.759
Because all the other kids
in this class

32:08.635 --> 32:11.346
knew what they did to be put
into this class.

32:11.971 --> 32:15.808
They were all there for a very
specific on-paper reason.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.186
But with me,
it was just a feeling!

32:20.146 --> 32:22.231
That the whole faculty agreed on

32:22.982 --> 32:24.442
to separate me now.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.321
So, that same year,

32:28.863 --> 32:30.949
I had this one teacher,
Mr. Marigan.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.159
He was my favorite teacher.
And here's the thing,

32:33.242 --> 32:35.119
I was really weird,
I didn't have any friends,

32:35.203 --> 32:37.830
I loved attention,
which is why this is happening.

32:38.873 --> 32:41.918
So I really needed someone
to talk to. If you're a weird kid,

32:42.001 --> 32:44.504
you find someone, your family,
a teacher. For me,

32:44.587 --> 32:46.881
that was the cool science teacher
I had. Mr. Marigan.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.675
Because even if I was
having a bad day,

32:48.758 --> 32:51.302
I could still tell him a couple
of jokes in class

32:51.386 --> 32:53.680
when I walked in
that I knew he'd appreciate

32:53.763 --> 32:55.014
more than these dumb kids.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.059
So I'd be like, "Hey, Mr. Marigan,
I read in this book

32:58.142 --> 33:01.062
that I can talk to dead people
if I have a pint of goat's blood,

33:01.145 --> 33:03.189
a human thumb,
and a paper plate.

33:04.273 --> 33:05.775
Do you have any plates?"

33:07.318 --> 33:08.945
Yeah, exactly. Kid jokes.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.073
Ten years later,

33:12.156 --> 33:16.369
my little brother became
best friends with Mr. Marigan's son.

33:16.452 --> 33:18.788
This is really what he said
to my brother. He goes,

33:18.871 --> 33:22.458
"Oh, wow, you're David's brother?

33:22.542 --> 33:25.003
That kid scared the shit out of me.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.965
Yeah, the 'talk to dead people' kid.
Is he in jail?"

33:29.882 --> 33:31.592
And I said to my brother, "No way.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.928
No way. I know Mr. Marigan loved me."

33:34.012 --> 33:36.347
I was, like, his favorite student.
And I have proof,

33:36.806 --> 33:39.475
because that year
my mom had made a deal with me.

33:39.559 --> 33:43.229
I could only go to camp
if my worst grade for the year

33:43.312 --> 33:44.439
was a B- or better.

33:44.522 --> 33:45.773
And I knew I wasn't going to go,

33:45.857 --> 33:48.151
because I actually got a really
bad grade on Marigan's final,

33:48.234 --> 33:50.194
I was going to get more like a D+.

33:50.778 --> 33:53.573
And then last day of school,
I got my report card,

33:53.656 --> 33:57.660
and I was-- I swear to God--
shocked, because I got my B-.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.245
And I knew I didn't deserve it.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.998
I figured, "He knows how hard I'm
working and how much I wanted it.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.126
I'm a good student, he gave me some
extra points." Whatever it was,

34:05.209 --> 34:07.170
I just knew he hooked me up
for some reason.

34:07.253 --> 34:08.671
And that meant a lot to me.

34:08.755 --> 34:11.090
That was why Mr. Marigan was
my favorite teacher

34:11.174 --> 34:12.467
for years after that.

34:14.093 --> 34:18.056
Until... I got to hear the other half
of that story.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.558
This is really what he said to
my brother. He goes,

34:21.893 --> 34:24.479
"Look, I'm going to tell you
how much that kid freaked me out.

34:25.354 --> 34:28.733
I don't know how he did it, I don't
know how he figured out how to do it.

34:28.816 --> 34:30.318
But somehow, some way,

34:30.401 --> 34:32.653
when I was doing his grade point
average at the end of the year,

34:33.071 --> 34:36.783
it equaled out to a perfect 66.6.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.748
I was so scared I gave him a B-."

34:45.208 --> 34:48.336
Yeah, turns out, Marigan did not
understand me at all. But,

34:48.419 --> 34:49.712
it did get me into camp.

34:49.796 --> 34:51.047
Which, by the way,

34:51.130 --> 34:53.299
was a terrible experience
I wish I hadn't gone to.

34:54.467 --> 34:57.386
Honestly, I think the reason
I was so weird, part of it,

34:57.470 --> 34:59.639
is that my mom had me really young.
She was 18,

34:59.722 --> 35:04.435
I love my mom, but she wasn't ready
for how weird I would be.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.062
Here's a perfect example.

35:06.145 --> 35:08.815
So, the next year, I was probably 13,

35:08.898 --> 35:10.024
and like I said,

35:10.108 --> 35:12.276
I was really unpopular, no friends,

35:12.360 --> 35:14.862
and I was desperate for a girlfriend.
I wanted a girlfriend so bad.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.239
And I wasn't even horny.

35:16.322 --> 35:19.992
I was fantasizing about someday
getting to buy a girl a locket.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.703
Like, that's how wholesome I was.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.665
So, I knew I could never date a girl
at my own school.

35:25.748 --> 35:26.624
So I had a plan.

35:26.707 --> 35:30.253
If I could just meet girls
in other school districts,

35:30.837 --> 35:33.172
it could take weeks for them
to find out about me.

35:33.881 --> 35:36.551
So I got a bunch of art supplies
that I had in my basement,

35:36.634 --> 35:38.386
because I was actually really
into drawing at the time.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.804
I actually went to college
to be a painter,

35:39.887 --> 35:41.556
that's why I do comedy for a living.

35:42.098 --> 35:45.685
So I got these art supplies,
and I really did this.

35:45.768 --> 35:46.894
I'm not even joking.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.897
I really made a bunch of hand-drawn

35:49.981 --> 35:54.026
homemade posters that really did say,

35:55.236 --> 35:58.239
"Children's Dating Service."

36:00.575 --> 36:04.370
Oh! And, my phone number.

36:06.372 --> 36:09.750
And my mom walked in on me
making these posters,

36:10.459 --> 36:13.004
and I swear to God, she said,

36:13.713 --> 36:16.299
"Oh, good idea!
Want me to help you put these up?"

36:17.675 --> 36:19.093
That is poor parenting.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.555
I am convinced to this day that
the only reason I wasn't molested

36:22.638 --> 36:24.265
is that every pervert in my town

36:24.348 --> 36:27.476
thought that this was the laziest
police sting they'd ever seen.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.980
Thanks a lot, guys. I'm Dave.

36:31.063 --> 36:33.733
We've got... we've got such
a great show for you.

36:33.816 --> 36:37.320
This next comic, he is one
of my favorite comics in the world.

36:37.403 --> 36:39.780
You may have seen him in the movie
<i>Big Time Adolescence</i>.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.657
Let's give a big hand, everybody,
for Joey Gay!

36:41.741 --> 36:43.993
[cheers and applause]

36:44.744 --> 36:47.580
What's up, fuckers,
how are you?

36:49.123 --> 36:51.709
Oh no, that's not going to work!
How are you?

36:52.501 --> 36:54.754
-[Joey] That's right!
-It was fine.

36:54.837 --> 36:58.758
It's great to be here.
My name is Joey Gay, G-A-Y.

36:58.841 --> 37:00.384
I grew up in Brooklyn.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.470
That shit was not cool.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.474
Other children beat the shit
out of me

37:07.308 --> 37:09.644
because my last name is Gay.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.480
Two weeks ago I found out
my last name

37:12.563 --> 37:15.441
is from the Champagne region
in France.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.568
I know, it got gayer!

37:19.195 --> 37:22.782
<i>Which seems weird in this late stage</i>
<i>in the game.</i>

37:23.199 --> 37:26.118
And it's supposed to be pronounced,
"Ghee."

37:28.371 --> 37:29.956
Right? But I still live in Brooklyn,

37:30.039 --> 37:31.791
I don't have the time

37:32.291 --> 37:34.001
or the balls

37:34.669 --> 37:36.963
to correct people.
Like, "Oh, no, sir,

37:37.964 --> 37:39.757
that's pronounced 'Ghee'."

37:40.800 --> 37:42.927
People in Brooklyn are dickheads,
they'll be like,

37:43.010 --> 37:46.514
"Oh, I know, I got a cousin
who's 'ghee,' he sucks 'cooks.'"

37:50.393 --> 37:53.604
So happy to be here tonight.
I had a heart attack recently.

37:53.688 --> 37:56.732
They wheeled me into the hospital.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.735
The doctor came out and
the first thing he said to me was,

38:00.319 --> 38:03.614
"Sir, we found drugs
in your system."

38:04.282 --> 38:09.203
I was like, "Ah, Doctor,
I put the drugs in my system.

38:09.996 --> 38:14.542
Let's move on to the heart attack.
That's the part I don't know about."

38:18.129 --> 38:20.798
He wanted to be a dick,
he wanted to keep going, He's like,

38:20.881 --> 38:23.134
"About the drugs..."
I was like, "Fuck this guy,

38:23.217 --> 38:24.635
I'm going to flip it on him."

38:24.719 --> 38:27.388
I was like, "Yeah, about the drugs,

38:27.763 --> 38:29.348
I want them back!"

38:32.852 --> 38:35.730
They had to prepare me for surgery.
That was scary.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.482
While they prepared me for surgery,

38:38.566 --> 38:40.776
they shaved down here,

38:41.235 --> 38:42.778
but only half.

38:44.822 --> 38:48.159
Only the right half, the top
and one of the twins,

38:48.242 --> 38:49.827
the low-hanging one.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.041
Yeah!

38:55.624 --> 39:00.087
And then, they started surgery
by going in through my wrist.

39:01.672 --> 39:02.757
Yes!

39:04.925 --> 39:06.844
I was like, "Hey, what the fuck?"

39:06.927 --> 39:10.306
He was like, "Well, in case
this doesn't work, we'll go in."

39:10.389 --> 39:12.350
I was like,
"Couldn't you have waited?

39:13.059 --> 39:14.477
Look at this!"

39:14.935 --> 39:18.731
Do you know what it's like to be
laying naked, on the edge of death,

39:19.065 --> 39:21.734
surrounded by strangers,
thinking, "God!

39:22.360 --> 39:26.364
Let me live
so I can shave this other nut.

39:29.075 --> 39:32.745
Don't send me to the afterlife
looking like this, Lord."

39:33.621 --> 39:36.040
Having a heart attack
is a fucked-up thing.

39:36.123 --> 39:38.751
After that,
you've got to change stuff.

39:39.293 --> 39:41.921
You got to change stuff.
I had to start exercising,

39:42.004 --> 39:44.131
I had to give up cigarettes.

39:44.548 --> 39:48.511
Oh my God! Do I miss cigarettes.

39:48.844 --> 39:53.766
Cigarettes are the single greatest
vice on the planet.

39:54.266 --> 39:57.019
If you don't believe me,
allow me to explain.

39:57.478 --> 40:00.856
People used to go home at night
to smoke,

40:00.940 --> 40:04.235
and they would put on
their smoking jacket.

40:06.570 --> 40:11.242
It is a vice that is so good,
it had apparel.

40:12.284 --> 40:14.912
You would go into your home
and put on a silk jacket

40:14.995 --> 40:17.206
like some sort of tobacco pimp.

40:21.544 --> 40:25.297
I wish other vices
had apparel, too.

40:27.716 --> 40:30.177
Right? So then when you showed up
at the bar

40:30.970 --> 40:33.806
on Friday night
and you saw your friends,

40:34.432 --> 40:37.518
you would know exactly what type
of bullshit

40:37.601 --> 40:39.645
you were in for that night.

40:39.728 --> 40:42.148
People would be like,
"Hey, there's Larry!"

40:42.231 --> 40:44.442
You would be like,
"Don't wave at Larry."

40:44.525 --> 40:47.736
"Why not?"
"Larry is wearing his crack helmet.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.075
Larry is going to be
an asshole tonight!

40:53.159 --> 40:55.536
Borrowing money,
chewing on his face."

40:58.539 --> 41:01.667
I'm getting older and finding out
in weird fucking ways.

41:02.835 --> 41:05.504
I found out I was getting old
at my bodega.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.174
Last year, when they gave me
my change, they were like,

41:08.257 --> 41:09.550
"Thank you, my dude."

41:10.593 --> 41:12.845
Now they go, "Thank you, sir."

41:12.928 --> 41:14.430
Hey! Fuck you!

41:16.765 --> 41:18.934
Ease off on that "sir" shit.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.979
Whenever some young motherfucker
gives me that "sir" shit,

41:22.062 --> 41:24.231
I have something for them, though.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.816
When they go,
"Thank you, sir." I go,

41:25.900 --> 41:29.028
"I welcome your thanks,
young squire!"

41:32.198 --> 41:37.369
See, that puts an end
to that "sir" shit 99% of the time.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.499
But the asshole at <i>my </i>bodega
on the corner

41:41.582 --> 41:44.877
likes to spend his weekends
at the Renaissance festival.

41:46.420 --> 41:50.007
Yeah, so now every time I come in,
he's like, "My liege!"

41:52.510 --> 41:54.428
I like Los Angeles.
It's crazy though.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.639
I was out here on
Hollywood Boulevard,

41:56.722 --> 41:59.475
it reminds me of my hometown,
New York.

41:59.558 --> 42:03.395
Listen, if you are
from New York or L.A.,

42:04.063 --> 42:08.776
you have a superpower that
other people in the country don't.

42:08.859 --> 42:13.781
And that is you can ignore
more crazy...

42:15.866 --> 42:18.035
than anybody else on the planet.

42:22.790 --> 42:26.001
You could be standing on a corner
waiting for the light to change.

42:26.085 --> 42:29.672
A stranger could walk up
next to you.

42:30.548 --> 42:34.385
He could be holding
a severed human head,

42:36.637 --> 42:38.556
wearing no pants,

42:40.099 --> 42:41.725
no underwear,

42:41.809 --> 42:44.478
rock-hard dick out to here!

42:45.187 --> 42:47.064
If you're from a town like ours,
you just go,

42:47.147 --> 42:50.109
"Not my head, not my dick,
not my business."

42:52.778 --> 42:56.365
Thank you very much. I have enjoyed
this more than you have.

42:57.157 --> 42:58.951
[cheers and applause]

43:00.536 --> 43:04.540
It is my pleasure to bring to the
stage a man you've seen here

43:04.623 --> 43:07.001
on Netflix on the show <i>Love</i>.

43:07.084 --> 43:10.296
Ladies and gentlemen,
a big round of applause

43:10.379 --> 43:12.506
for Mr. Jordan Rock.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.675
[cheers and applause]

43:15.676 --> 43:17.469
Ah, you guys can make
more noise than that.

43:17.553 --> 43:19.430
What's good, L.A.?
Make some noise!

43:19.513 --> 43:21.390
[cheers and applause]

43:22.099 --> 43:23.767
Nice. Nice.

43:23.851 --> 43:26.520
So, 2022, how we feeling about it?

43:26.604 --> 43:27.855
[scattered clamoring]

43:27.938 --> 43:30.441
Not even a clap, alright.

43:31.358 --> 43:33.944
I know, right?
We're feeling it out still.

43:34.028 --> 43:36.071
I don't know, man.
Not that it's a bad year,

43:36.155 --> 43:38.616
we just had two bad years
back to back.

43:39.241 --> 43:41.827
Right? Like 2020, 2021...

43:41.910 --> 43:44.163
2021 started good.

43:44.246 --> 43:45.789
They let us outside.

43:48.959 --> 43:51.837
They were like, "Go, be out there!"

43:52.338 --> 43:54.048
They told us
to take the masks off,

43:54.131 --> 43:57.009
we threw them in the air
like it was graduation.

43:58.093 --> 44:00.471
And then they were like,
"Put them back on!"

44:00.554 --> 44:02.931
And we were like, "No,
that's not how this shit works.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.350
Alright? No!

44:04.433 --> 44:07.353
You reneging right now. Nah."

44:07.811 --> 44:10.689
The CDC was acting like your parents
after they gave you too much freedom.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.441
You felt that, right?

44:12.524 --> 44:15.819
CDC was on TV like, "Bring the car
back right now, alright?"

44:17.404 --> 44:20.115
You were like, "No, you said
I could be out though!"

44:21.075 --> 44:24.495
"Yeah, I said you could be out, I didn't
say you could be with your friends."

44:26.455 --> 44:28.457
That was our life, man.
We made it out.

44:28.540 --> 44:30.376
What else happened in 2021?
We got that new president.

44:30.459 --> 44:31.627
How do we feel about him?

44:31.710 --> 44:33.545
[scattered applause]

44:35.506 --> 44:36.632
Eh...

44:37.758 --> 44:40.135
I'm not political,
I don't have any political jokes.

44:40.219 --> 44:42.513
But I will say this about Joe Biden.

44:44.223 --> 44:47.184
I didn't even know I liked
my president tweeting

44:49.061 --> 44:50.521
until it stopped.

44:52.231 --> 44:54.733
Now I'm just like, "Nigga...

44:54.817 --> 44:57.194
where you at, bro?" Like...

44:59.613 --> 45:01.657
What the fuck?
Yo, Trump tweeted all the time.

45:01.740 --> 45:02.991
Trump tweeted like Kanye,

45:03.075 --> 45:05.244
it was like, "Yo,
take this nigga's phone, bro!"

45:07.996 --> 45:10.207
But the con was, every time Trump
tweeted, it was like,

45:10.290 --> 45:12.793
"I feel like he about to go to war.
I feel like..."

45:15.170 --> 45:17.089
But now we almost there.

45:18.048 --> 45:21.427
And I'm just looking at Joe Biden
like, "Nigga...

45:22.344 --> 45:25.848
start an Instagram
or something, bro, please!

45:27.307 --> 45:30.394
A TikTok!
You got to reach Gen Z, man!"

45:31.687 --> 45:34.273
Speaking of Gen Z,
is there any Gen Z in here? Any?

45:34.356 --> 45:35.732
[audience cheering]

45:36.233 --> 45:40.737
Alright, round of applause if you
are over the age of 25.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.948
[cheers and applause]

45:43.699 --> 45:45.200
Nice. My people.

45:45.742 --> 45:48.745
Round of applause if you are
under the age of 25.

45:48.829 --> 45:50.581
[cheers and applause]

45:53.000 --> 45:54.334
I'm glad you're all here.

45:56.295 --> 45:59.590
I'll take it on behalf of everybody
over the age of 25

45:59.673 --> 46:03.093
to finally say to everyone under 25:

46:04.219 --> 46:05.929
fuck Gen Z!

46:07.848 --> 46:10.184
We don't like you!

46:10.267 --> 46:13.020
I'm a millennial, yo,
I thought we were bad.

46:13.770 --> 46:15.689
Yeah, we had opinions.

46:16.231 --> 46:18.192
No one gave a fuck.

46:18.817 --> 46:22.821
Everyone under 25, y'all got opinions
and you want everyone to know them,

46:22.905 --> 46:25.657
and you want everybody to change
for you.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.244
Yeah, everyone under the age of 25
is like,

46:29.328 --> 46:32.289
"I know I just got here in 1997,

46:34.875 --> 46:37.294
but you're doing it wrong, alright?

46:37.878 --> 46:41.798
Listen to me, okay? I read a book
and wrote a blog, alright?

46:41.882 --> 46:43.175
Listen to me.

46:43.258 --> 46:46.428
I've never signed a lease,
but listen, okay?"

46:48.514 --> 46:51.558
I hate it, man.
Millennials, we were progressive.

46:51.642 --> 46:55.187
We did progressive shit,
but we didn't lead like that, you know?

46:55.270 --> 46:58.023
It was just like, "Yo man, why you
doing that? That shit's hard."

47:00.943 --> 47:03.779
That was it. "Yo, why you wearing
that? That shit's dope."

47:04.696 --> 47:06.281
That's all we needed.

47:06.740 --> 47:11.078
Ask anybody under the age of 25
why they're doing anything.

47:11.620 --> 47:13.330
Like, "Hey man, why are you wearing
that shirt?"

47:13.413 --> 47:16.416
"Clothing's my outlet."
"Yo, shut the fuck up, please.

47:16.542 --> 47:17.751
Please?

47:18.877 --> 47:21.797
Please shut up. Please,
please, please, please, please."

47:21.880 --> 47:25.509
Talking about anybody
under the age of 25

47:27.010 --> 47:30.097
with a Twitter account.
Fuck you. Alright?

47:33.392 --> 47:35.644
Yes, thank you, up top.
Thank you, thank you.

47:36.436 --> 47:40.524
Yeah, I'm happy about 2022
that nothing racial's happened yet.

47:41.233 --> 47:43.193
I hate when racial shit happens
in the country,

47:43.277 --> 47:45.529
like cops shoot an unarmed
black man.

47:46.238 --> 47:47.447
Go back to work the next day,

47:47.531 --> 47:50.200
all your white friends
are overcompensating.

47:51.577 --> 47:55.831
Yeah, you get it. You're Asian,
you're a POC, yeah!

47:57.624 --> 48:00.877
Show up the next day, all your white
friends in your face like, "Hey.

48:04.631 --> 48:06.383
Do you know...

48:07.509 --> 48:09.303
that Black lives...

48:10.137 --> 48:11.722
matter?"

48:13.682 --> 48:15.350
And I'm just looking at them
confused, like,

48:15.434 --> 48:17.978
"Yeah, I thought all of that
was for you.

48:19.104 --> 48:23.358
I've been here, I'm Black,
I matter. Tell your grandpa, please.

48:24.818 --> 48:26.612
He makes the laws."

48:28.572 --> 48:31.283
I hate it, man.
All my white friends overcompensate.

48:31.366 --> 48:34.161
All my other friends
act like good people.

48:34.745 --> 48:37.456
I hate it. I go on Facebook,
all my friends turn into activists

48:37.539 --> 48:38.915
out of nowhere.

48:38.999 --> 48:40.876
Yeah, I read the post,
by the end of it I'm like,

48:40.959 --> 48:45.130
"But nigga, I know you. You're...
you're a piece of shit, man.

48:45.213 --> 48:47.299
You curse at your mom.
What are you talking about?"

48:49.176 --> 48:51.428
I hate it.
My boys get way too into it.

48:51.511 --> 48:53.013
Went on Facebook the other day,
my boy was like,

48:53.096 --> 48:54.389
"I'm about to donate to charity!"

48:54.473 --> 48:56.892
I was like, "Whoa, nigga,
you owe me $40,

48:56.975 --> 48:58.310
what are you talking about?

48:59.144 --> 49:01.855
Fuck this GoFundMe, bro,
you don't know her, alright?

49:01.938 --> 49:04.566
I was there for you when
you needed it. Break me, nigga."

49:06.568 --> 49:08.904
Found out
I was a piece of shit in 2020.

49:09.905 --> 49:12.658
Not that I'm a piece of shit,
it's just that I have a selfish set

49:12.741 --> 49:14.159
of inner values.

49:14.242 --> 49:18.080
I have to answer to God
about that when I go, okay?

49:18.830 --> 49:22.084
But I'm still with the shit,
I still don't fuck with racism,

49:22.167 --> 49:24.086
systemic racism,

49:24.169 --> 49:25.796
police brutality.

49:26.421 --> 49:27.881
The police.

49:29.257 --> 49:31.510
But at the same time, there are
certain things that affect me

49:31.593 --> 49:32.761
just as much as the police.

49:32.844 --> 49:34.304
There are certain things
that happened to me

49:34.388 --> 49:38.517
that I think are just as bad
as the police, to me.

49:40.811 --> 49:42.062
Y'all quiet as shit right now.

49:42.145 --> 49:45.774
Y'all are like, "Where the fuck is he
going with all these trigger words?

49:46.733 --> 49:48.902
Just trigger after trigger
after trigger, I'm triggered."

49:49.986 --> 49:52.155
I got y'all, I'll make it funny,
alright? Here we go.

49:52.239 --> 49:54.533
Y'all ready for...? This is something.
Y'all ready for something

49:54.616 --> 49:56.368
that I think is just as bad
as the police?

49:56.451 --> 49:58.662
-[woman] Yeah.
-Alright, here we go.

50:06.628 --> 50:08.588
If you're a woman,

50:13.051 --> 50:16.138
and you give a half-ass blowjob,

50:18.265 --> 50:22.561
you are just as bad

50:23.353 --> 50:25.480
as the police

50:26.732 --> 50:29.234
to me, okay?

50:29.526 --> 50:31.778
You are oppressing me.

50:32.404 --> 50:34.990
You're stopping me from reaching
my full potential.

50:35.532 --> 50:38.618
And I know you're causing that
police brutality outside, alright?

50:39.870 --> 50:41.705
Because officers with empty nuts

50:41.788 --> 50:44.249
don't shoot unarmed black people, okay?

50:45.417 --> 50:48.962
We cannot have these officers
in the streets

50:49.463 --> 50:51.047
with full nuts

50:52.299 --> 50:54.217
and full clips.

50:57.971 --> 51:00.307
One of them has to be empty.

51:09.024 --> 51:11.151
So ladies, we need you.

51:11.818 --> 51:14.070
Every woman in this room.

51:15.447 --> 51:16.865
We need you.

51:18.408 --> 51:20.619
We need you the most, alright?

51:21.411 --> 51:23.371
Next time you suck a dick, alright?

51:23.955 --> 51:26.249
Go down there with intent, alright?
Just...

51:27.042 --> 51:30.921
Just energy, commitment, alright?
Grab the head right here, okay?

51:31.880 --> 51:34.758
This is where all the nerves are.
Fuck the shaft,

51:34.841 --> 51:36.885
grab the balls, tickle the taint,

51:36.968 --> 51:38.929
spit, elbow grease.

51:43.183 --> 51:44.643
I'll sum it all up.

51:46.269 --> 51:48.021
Ladies, if you can,

51:49.356 --> 51:51.024
next time you suck a dick,

51:53.026 --> 51:54.444
please...

51:56.238 --> 51:57.823
suck dick...

52:01.117 --> 52:03.328
like Black lives matter.

52:10.669 --> 52:13.421
We need you!

52:13.505 --> 52:15.924
White women, we really need you,
okay? We really do.

52:16.007 --> 52:19.594
You have, uh... You have BLM
on all your dating profiles.

52:19.678 --> 52:21.221
It's time to prove it, alright?

52:23.557 --> 52:25.559
I'm Jordan Rock,
and with that being said,

52:25.642 --> 52:29.020
are you ready for me to bring back
the man of the hour?

52:31.314 --> 52:36.570
Make some noise for my motherfucking
nigga, Pete Davidson, everybody.

52:36.653 --> 52:39.197
[cheers and applause]

52:43.410 --> 52:44.578
Woo!

52:44.661 --> 52:47.289
Jordan Rock, everybody.
Jordan Rock.

52:48.748 --> 52:51.459
Backstage, I was like,
welp, I'm getting canceled.

52:53.628 --> 52:55.964
Thank you.
Thank you guys all for coming out.

52:56.047 --> 52:59.843
One more time for all the comics
that you see tonight.

52:59.926 --> 53:01.970
[cheers and applause]

53:02.679 --> 53:06.850
Anyways, this next guy who's coming
to the stage...

53:07.350 --> 53:13.148
we celebrated Christmas together
in 2018.

53:13.231 --> 53:17.402
We were at my mom's house, we were
living together at my mom's house...

53:19.446 --> 53:20.822
in her basement.

53:22.407 --> 53:24.743
And I remember we were looking
at each other, and we were like,

53:24.826 --> 53:26.286
"It's okay.

53:27.537 --> 53:29.539
Our careers are fucking over.
It's fine.

53:30.665 --> 53:33.084
We had fun. It's all good."

53:33.168 --> 53:35.795
Whoever would have thought
we could have done anything, right?

53:36.504 --> 53:40.634
This guy now has
two number-one albums in a row.

53:40.717 --> 53:44.054
He's I think one of the biggest names
you can get.

53:44.137 --> 53:47.933
Please give it up for
Machine Gun Kelly, everyone!
