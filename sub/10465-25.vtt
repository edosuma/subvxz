09:41.200 --> 09:43.434
He's got a girlfriend
and she can't go. So...

09:44.534 --> 09:46.033
I've been back, like, a month.

09:46.033 --> 09:47.167
You wanna go away already?

09:47.167 --> 09:49.100
It's not about leaving you.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.300
I just-- I wanna travel

09:52.300 --> 09:54.701
an-and do stuff,
an-and get, like,

09:54.701 --> 09:57.033
lots of weird jobs,
and go to weird places,

09:57.033 --> 09:58.534
an-and figure stuff out.

09:58.534 --> 10:01.033
With him?

10:01.033 --> 10:02.534
No. With you.

10:02.534 --> 10:04.501
But you've got stuff
keeping you here.

10:07.534 --> 10:09.934
And you don't wanna go,
and he does.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.734
So you asking me
if you can go?

10:13.734 --> 10:16.701
I don't have to ask.

10:22.767 --> 10:25.334
Couldn't sleep.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.167
Me either.

10:28.834 --> 10:31.200
You and Charlie
have a fight or something?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.467
Oh, no. No.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.033
No.

10:38.634 --> 10:41.400
Did they--? Did he
and Kirsten fight a lot?

10:42.968 --> 10:45.067
I don't know.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.767
A normal amount,
like anybody.

10:48.734 --> 10:50.467
She wouldn't let them
go to bed mad.

10:51.701 --> 10:52.901
She made that a rule.

10:53.968 --> 10:54.901
That's a good rule.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.167
[SIGHS]

10:57.167 --> 10:58.968
They were probably
a good couple.

10:58.968 --> 11:01.000
I mean, obviously
something went wrong,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.133
but I'll bet they wanted
the same things.

11:03.133 --> 11:07.300
I guess.
I-I'm gonna go get a--

11:07.300 --> 11:08.667
So they probably had a lot

11:08.667 --> 11:10.167
of stuff figured out,
then, right?

11:10.167 --> 11:11.734
Like, I don't know,

11:11.734 --> 11:14.300
how many kids
they wanted to have...

11:14.300 --> 11:15.567
Oh, she couldn't.

11:16.167 --> 11:17.200
What?

11:19.434 --> 11:21.534
Kirsten couldn't have kids.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.801
Do we have to talk
about this?

11:25.801 --> 11:29.467
No. I'm sorry
I brought it up.

11:35.868 --> 11:38.400
No. No. Two.
Two for tomorrow night.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.734
Tomorrow. That's, uh--
That's no good for me.

11:41.734 --> 11:46.033
Yes. Salinger, S-A-L--

11:46.033 --> 11:49.501
No. Same spelling, but no.

11:51.334 --> 11:52.667
No, I haven't read that one.

11:54.534 --> 11:57.968
Okay. Okay. Thanks. Bye.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.400
Uh-huh.

12:00.534 --> 12:01.534
What?

12:01.534 --> 12:02.734
I'm intrigued.

12:02.734 --> 12:04.501
Who's "two"?

12:04.501 --> 12:07.234
Nobody. Just Sarah.

12:07.234 --> 12:10.100
You've been seeing a lot
of just Sarah lately.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.267
Yeah? So?

12:12.267 --> 12:14.334
Are you two
getting back together?

12:14.334 --> 12:18.601
Well, I don't know.

12:18.601 --> 12:20.434
I mean, I never would have
thought so.

12:20.434 --> 12:22.701
But...

12:22.701 --> 12:25.801
She just broke up
with this guy she's been dating.

12:25.801 --> 12:27.834
And we've been spending
a lot of time together.

12:27.834 --> 12:31.400
And sometimes it seems like
she's saying she wants us to.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.734
Cool.

12:32.734 --> 12:35.767
Weird is what it is, actually.

12:37.501 --> 12:39.000
I mean, with all this stuff

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
falling back into place
for me right now,

12:43.434 --> 12:46.601
do you think a girl
who I cheated on and--

12:46.601 --> 12:48.300
And lied to and--

12:48.300 --> 12:49.701
Put in the hospital.

12:49.701 --> 12:52.133
Right. Right.
Put in the hospital.

12:54.133 --> 12:56.868
Do you think she could possibly
still wanna be with me?

13:07.267 --> 13:09.067
Is this, like,
the silent treatment here?

13:09.067 --> 13:10.667
Griffin.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.734
If you just
give me a chance.

13:12.734 --> 13:17.133
Uh, that stuff that I said
didn't exactly come out right.

13:17.133 --> 13:19.200
No kidding.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.901
It's just
I-I don't trust things.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.901
Right. You don't trust me.

13:24.901 --> 13:28.434
No, no, not you.
I trust you.

13:28.434 --> 13:31.934
I don't trust, like, life.

13:31.934 --> 13:33.434
I-I don't trust life.

13:33.434 --> 13:34.901
What is that?

13:34.901 --> 13:37.767
Nothing is gonna
happen, Griffin.

13:37.767 --> 13:39.033
Really?

13:39.033 --> 13:40.334
'Cause I've been
running over

13:40.334 --> 13:41.834
a list of possibilities
in my head,

13:41.834 --> 13:43.367
do you wanna hear them?

13:43.367 --> 13:44.601
All right, say you, uh,

13:44.601 --> 13:45.934
fall in love
with Justin, or--

13:45.934 --> 13:47.434
Or-- Okay, say--

13:47.434 --> 13:49.334
Say that you get in a fight
with Justin

13:49.334 --> 13:51.834
and you feel lonely and you
fall in love with somebody else.

13:51.834 --> 13:56.100
Or, uh, yo-you find a job
that you really, really want

13:56.100 --> 13:58.434
in the most beautiful country
you've ever seen.

13:58.434 --> 14:01.434
O-Or you run off to Rome
and become a nun.

14:01.434 --> 14:03.167
Griffin.

14:03.167 --> 14:05.534
O-Or, say
I do something really stupid

14:05.534 --> 14:08.634
like, uh, I'm rushing home
to get a phone call from you,

14:08.634 --> 14:09.901
and I don't look up,
and, uh--

14:09.901 --> 14:12.968
And I get flattened
by a 2-ton safe, or--

14:12.968 --> 14:15.167
Or a baby grand
falling on my head.

14:15.167 --> 14:19.234
Don't laugh, 'cause, uh,
that's the kind of stuff

14:19.234 --> 14:20.601
that happens to us.

14:22.701 --> 14:26.567
We're not exactly
lucky people, Julia.

14:26.567 --> 14:28.300
We gotta be careful.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.300
[***]

14:31.300 --> 14:33.601
I don't wanna take
my eyes off of you.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.701
Oh, Mrs. Reeves, hi.

14:43.701 --> 14:44.734
Hello.

14:46.334 --> 14:48.067
Uh, is-- Is Sarah--

14:48.067 --> 14:49.334
She's not here.

14:49.334 --> 14:50.934
I just gotten
a couple tickets

14:50.934 --> 14:53.300
to this thing, this, um,
Cherry Blossom Festival?

14:56.534 --> 14:58.567
It's at the--
The Peace Pagoda.

15:03.300 --> 15:08.400
Mrs. Reeves, I want you to know
that I'm doing better now.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.701
I am.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.601
And I can understand why
you'd hate to see--

15:13.601 --> 15:15.501
You know, something, Bailey,

15:15.501 --> 15:16.968
you really don't have to.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.367
I know that
you've been through a lot,

15:20.367 --> 15:21.367
and I wish you the best.

15:21.367 --> 15:22.367
We both do.

15:22.367 --> 15:23.334
Really?

15:24.868 --> 15:27.701
Well, I really appreciate that.

15:27.701 --> 15:29.968
In any case, she's not going to
be back anytime soon.

15:29.968 --> 15:32.033
She's out with her father.
They're celebrating.

15:32.834 --> 15:36.067
Celebrating? Great. Because?

15:36.067 --> 15:38.501
Sarah got into Brown.

15:40.567 --> 15:41.901
Wow! Brown?

15:43.601 --> 15:45.434
That's--

15:45.434 --> 15:47.534
That's in-- In Connecticut?

15:47.534 --> 15:49.634
Rhode Island,
actually.

15:49.634 --> 15:52.267
Wow!

15:52.267 --> 15:54.534
That's-- That's fantastic.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.934
Well, I bet-- I bet
you're gonna miss her.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.601
Of course it's going to be sad
having her far away from us.

16:02.601 --> 16:05.100
But in Sarah's case,

16:05.100 --> 16:07.601
I think it's going to be
a good thing for her

16:07.601 --> 16:09.734
if it means her
being far away from you.

16:17.467 --> 16:19.868
You were good at that
luncheon thing today.

16:19.868 --> 16:21.667
Couldn't concentrate much.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.434
Well, you couldn't tell.

16:23.434 --> 16:25.267
Auto pilot.

16:25.267 --> 16:27.534
Really, the only thing
that was going through my head

16:27.534 --> 16:30.133
the whole time was,
"Why didn't Charlie tell me

16:30.133 --> 16:31.734
Kirsten couldn't have children?"

16:34.734 --> 16:36.834
Maybe you thought
that was private or something.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.300
I don't know. Whatever.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.067
Except you two
didn't break up over that.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.601
I mean,
you obviously accepted it.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.767
No. That's-- No, look.

16:43.767 --> 16:44.701
I had to.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.400
But she wanted to have kids.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.767
It was a medical thing.

16:49.767 --> 16:51.400
And for me it's a choice.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.701
So, I guess,
according to you

16:52.701 --> 16:54.667
that makes me
some kinda awful, self--

16:54.667 --> 16:58.501
Grace, come on, you know
that's not how I feel about you.

16:58.501 --> 17:01.133
Fine. But the net net, here,

17:01.133 --> 17:02.868
is that you two
weren't gonna have kids,

17:02.868 --> 17:04.267
and we aren't
gonna have them.

17:04.267 --> 17:05.400
Am I right?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.300
Yeah. But that's not--

17:07.300 --> 17:11.467
I mean, I saw you pining
for her and--

17:11.467 --> 17:12.901
And chasing after her.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.834
And it was gonna
end up the same,

17:14.834 --> 17:16.733
the same as you and me.

17:16.733 --> 17:18.733
But for me it's not okay.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.200
Why is that?

17:21.133 --> 17:22.200
Why is that?

17:26.334 --> 17:27.767
I don't know.

17:42.934 --> 17:45.167
Bailey, where
have you been?

17:45.167 --> 17:46.701
It's-- It's 2
in the morning.

17:46.701 --> 17:47.834
Out.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.801
Wha-What does
that mean, "out"?

17:49.801 --> 17:51.133
What do you mean?

17:51.133 --> 17:53.434
I mean out.
Walking around. Out.

17:53.434 --> 17:54.601
Well, are you okay?

17:54.601 --> 17:56.434
I mean, were you--

17:56.434 --> 17:58.100
Are you, like,
wanting to drink?

17:58.100 --> 17:59.501
Uh-huh.

18:00.701 --> 18:01.834
Bailey--

18:01.834 --> 18:03.234
I didn't drink
anything, Claud.

18:03.234 --> 18:04.701
Okay? You can
stop panicking.

18:06.501 --> 18:07.634
Did you call Sarah?

18:07.634 --> 18:09.968
There's--
There's messages here.

18:09.968 --> 18:11.234
I know.

18:11.234 --> 18:12.834
So did you talk to her?

18:12.834 --> 18:14.734
No. I don't need to.

18:14.734 --> 18:17.634
I know why she's calling.

18:17.634 --> 18:19.367
[SIGHS]

18:19.367 --> 18:21.167
She got into Brown. Okay?

18:22.667 --> 18:26.267
And...she probably
wants to celebrate,

18:26.267 --> 18:28.267
which I'm not really
in the mood for.

18:28.267 --> 18:29.567
So...

18:29.567 --> 18:31.434
But I thought-- I mean...

18:31.434 --> 18:33.701
I mean, you guys have been
hanging around together

18:33.701 --> 18:35.100
so much lately, and if--

18:35.100 --> 18:36.467
I-If you're feeling bad--

18:36.467 --> 18:38.234
Look, I can't call her.
Okay, Claud?

18:39.467 --> 18:41.033
I mean, I shouldn't.

18:42.501 --> 18:44.067
After what I've done to her.

18:44.067 --> 18:46.234
Well, obviously,
she doesn't think that.

18:46.234 --> 18:50.334
She's going away, Claud,
3000 miles away.

18:50.334 --> 18:54.100
So that's not
an option anymore.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.100
I just--
I can't keep--

18:56.100 --> 18:57.801
[SIGHS]

18:57.801 --> 19:00.634
As far as I'm concerned,
she's not there anymore.

19:06.767 --> 19:07.834
Wait. Who are you calling?

19:08.868 --> 19:11.167
My sponsor.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.200

I'm not the phone.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.968
Sorry. Did the radio spot
run yet?

19:41.968 --> 19:43.567
Well, it was supposed
to be 4 p.m.

19:43.567 --> 19:46.501
Who's even up
at 4 a.m. besides me?

19:46.501 --> 19:48.200
Well, who do we talk to
about that?

19:48.200 --> 19:50.000
Ow! Owen. Cut that out.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.300
I want juice.

I'm going out with Robin, right?

just tell him

something like this

Maybe not, but if
they had been around

about what that means?

Of course.

For how long?
A-A minute? An hour?

it felt like the rightest thing
I have ever done in my life.

It felt like
with that one word,

36:45.234 --> 36:47.901
that everything else
just snapped into place.

be together forever and--

that I can go anywhere,

stop worrying
