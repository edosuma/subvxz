WEBVTT

00:16.517 --> 00:18.559
Aim, then fire.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.020
Rex, I bet sometimes even you miss.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.107
Speaking of,
you're missing Jedi training.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.317
Which is now. Remember?

00:27.486 --> 00:29.821
You know,
I can't be in two places at once.

00:29.905 --> 00:32.949
As a soldier,
you're gonna have to learn to prioritize.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.325
Well, he's not a soldier.

00:34.493 --> 00:35.535
He's a Jedi.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.995
Yeah. What if I don't want to be either?

00:43.627 --> 00:44.877
What's that supposed to mean?

00:45.170 --> 00:46.295
Hey, practice squad,

00:46.547 --> 00:49.173
Hera called a meeting.
Attendance is mandatory.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.262
So, what's bothering him?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.264
No idea. This is new.

01:01.937 --> 01:02.895
As we speak,

01:02.980 --> 01:06.107
the frozen planet of Rinn
is facing an energy crisis.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.651
When their supply of fuel cells is gone,

01:08.819 --> 01:10.528
the settlements
will not be able to power

01:10.612 --> 01:12.071
the heaters they need to survive.

01:12.156 --> 01:13.489
They'll freeze down there.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.242
Since we're on Garel,
we should check out the black market.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.786
Bound to be generators
or something we can get our hands on.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.539
See what you can find, without delay.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.042
Gear up, everyone.
Time to go make friends with the locals.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.670
Except you, Spectre-6.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.923
I asked you to clean the ion scoring
off The Phantom's exhaust ports...

01:31.008 --> 01:32.049
Twice.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.676
But I had Jedi practice.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.261
And blaster practice.

01:35.387 --> 01:37.513
Well, now you have scrubbing practice.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.349
What are you laughing at?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.185
You're gonna help him.

01:44.730 --> 01:45.813
We'll discuss this later?

01:46.023 --> 01:47.315
Can't wait for that.

01:58.285 --> 02:02.163
It's "clean the Ghost",
lightsaber training, blaster training.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.835
I kind of miss the old days
when everything was simple.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.051
-A distress signal? From who?
-This is the Broken Horn.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.803
-Broken Horn?
-We require assistance.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.095
That's Vizago's ship!

02:18.388 --> 02:20.932
Okay. Look, someone's in distress,

02:21.016 --> 02:23.434
and if there's one thing
I've learned from Kanan,

02:23.519 --> 02:25.561
it's that we help people in distress.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.318
Well, let's go see
what Vizago got himself into.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.987
I owe him a favor,
and this could square us.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.533
What? I know how to fly.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.391
No, I'm not running away
from my problems.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.977
I am simply helping someone
with their problems.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.603
There's a difference.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.983
That's Vizago's ship, all right.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.276
I wonder what happened.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.486
Vizago!

03:15.571 --> 03:17.280
Cikatro Vizago, do you read me?

03:21.243 --> 03:23.160
Well, of course,
we're going to board the ship.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.598
Vizago must be in trouble.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.474
Why else wouldn't he
answer his comm?

04:26.183 --> 04:27.391
They're shut off.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.686
Something is definitely not right.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.414
Vizago? Vizago, is that you?

04:51.375 --> 04:52.833
Not exactly.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.212
Well, hello there.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.714
Allow me to introduce myself.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.466
I am Hondo Ohnaka,

05:00.801 --> 05:02.969
proud owner of this fine but

05:03.387 --> 05:05.888
currently inoperative vessel.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.683
Where's Vizago? This is his ship.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.768
You know Vizago?

05:10.852 --> 05:13.396
Well, then we have a mutual friend.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.232
Yes, it was his ship.

05:16.400 --> 05:20.444
But we were enjoying
a friendly game of sabacc, and...

05:20.821 --> 05:23.239
Well, now it is my ship.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.658
Vizago bet his ship?

05:25.742 --> 05:28.577
Right after his droids,
which are now also mine.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.080
Watch. I turn them on.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.834
I turn them off. I love that.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.170
Yeah, okay, I guess that could happen.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.755
You know about me,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.424
but who are you?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.926
I'm Lando Calrissian.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.636
Lando!

05:45.762 --> 05:50.433
So at last I meet
the semi-famous Lando Calrissian!

05:51.268 --> 05:54.478
A tad younger than I pictured,

05:54.563 --> 05:56.188
but to be so young

05:56.398 --> 05:58.357
and flying to my rescue

05:58.567 --> 06:02.361
proves that you must be
the scoundrel I have heard of.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.780
Yeah. I mean, I am pretty good.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.283
He's pretty good.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.659
Are you looking for a crew?

06:08.744 --> 06:11.787
Good news. Hondo is hiring.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.998
I already have a crew.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.459
Speaking of, where'd my droid go?

06:16.835 --> 06:18.127
You lost your droid?

06:18.503 --> 06:21.797
I lost my whole crew,
thanks to the Empire.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.301
I once was a captain, you know.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.803
The stories I could tell.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.139
So many of them true.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.522
Yeah, you want to tell a story?

06:38.607 --> 06:40.816
Tell one to the Empire
while I try to get the power back on.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.987
Hello? How can we help you?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.238
Attention, transport.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.407
You have breached
an Imperial checkpoint.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.493
Hyperspace would be good!

06:59.044 --> 07:00.294
Think I got it!

07:03.381 --> 07:04.381
Well, Lando,

07:04.966 --> 07:08.052
it looks like we are off on an adventure!

07:18.230 --> 07:21.023
It is as if we were in each other's heads.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.567
We only just met,

07:23.652 --> 07:26.403
and we already make
a remarkable team.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.947
Yeah, but we're not.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.657
Not yet, perhaps.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.951
You know, I could use you for a job.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.620
A little trade, that is all.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.456
You know, I am an old man.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.959
I just need help pushing a few crates.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.710
Crates of what?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.216
Power generators?

07:47.843 --> 07:49.051
That's what you're smuggling?

07:49.344 --> 07:51.887
These are
pretty hard to get these days, old man.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.597
-Expensive, too.
-You're right.

07:54.015 --> 07:57.518
Which is why
we will sell them at a fair markup.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.562
Five hundred percent.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.649
Okay. I help you, you give me my
cut in power generators.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.733
Three crates.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.403
All right.
Two crates, and you have a deal.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.531
Two. And we split the profit of the third.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.366
Deal.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.578
The way you strike a bargain,

08:15.662 --> 08:18.414
you remind me of a great pirate I know.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.957
Me!

08:20.375 --> 08:22.877
Now, let's go split up the merchandise.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.839
Look, this could come in
handy if he gives us trouble.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.299
Hang on to it, Chop.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.126
Hey, stay here in case
there's any kind of trouble.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.713
I know we're already in trouble.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.465
Just keep your comm channel open.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.134
Hurry it up, Lando!

09:12.469 --> 09:13.969
We are on a schedule!

09:23.313 --> 09:25.189
So, who is the buyer anyway?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.778
All right. Where's Vizago?

09:31.029 --> 09:32.154
Azmorigan.

09:33.657 --> 09:37.159
Vizago is indisposed, so to speak,

09:37.244 --> 09:40.955
granting me the privilege of
conducting business with you,

09:41.039 --> 09:42.831
legendary one.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.669
Hondo Ohnaka at your service.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.631
ls this a joke?

09:51.508 --> 09:54.635
I don't deal with washed-up old relics.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.054
Come now,
let's leave your wife out of this.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.266
There is no need
for such impropriety among thieves.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.394
I am certain we can reach an accord.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.606
I'm certain we can.

10:11.695 --> 10:12.778
That was easy.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.280
Nice going, partner.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.032
Looks like you got us captured.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.326
It would be nice
if we had some backup!

10:21.454 --> 10:22.997
Just a thought,

10:23.081 --> 10:26.041
but why don't we just
call it even and go through

10:26.126 --> 10:28.168
with the original deal?
Sounds good, yes?

10:29.754 --> 10:32.589
I appreciate your offer, humbly,

10:32.674 --> 10:35.801
but I don't think you're gonna be
around to collect.

10:42.517 --> 10:46.812
Azmorigan,
take the fruits of our labor, if you must.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.731
That I understand. But this?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.065
ls it necessary?

10:50.358 --> 10:51.525
Yes.

10:51.609 --> 10:56.071
You see, the Rang Clan
has a nice bounty on your head.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.240
I'll collect on these generators

10:58.325 --> 11:01.952
and make an additional
profit from your death.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.664
Your business plan is impressive.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.334
Of course, it is. It's mine.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.919
Who is this?

11:13.923 --> 11:15.049
Hey. Hey.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.385
I know you... From somewhere.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.680
Calrissian's farm on Lothal!

11:21.890 --> 11:23.682
Well, of course, you know him.

11:23.850 --> 11:27.102
This is my longtime friend,
Lando Calrissian.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.937
What?

11:29.189 --> 11:32.149
No, he's not Calrissian!

11:32.734 --> 11:34.360
You lied to me?

11:34.611 --> 11:35.986
I knew I liked you!

11:38.615 --> 11:40.115
You...

11:40.200 --> 11:41.617
You robbed me.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.535
I will enjoy this.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.871
I get to collect on Ohnaka,

11:45.955 --> 11:48.916
I get to kill you
and I get to keep the five generators!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.168
All of them, five crates!

11:51.252 --> 11:52.294
Wait.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.254
There are only four crates here?

11:54.506 --> 11:56.507
You were supposed to bring me five!

11:56.966 --> 11:59.051
Well, the droid had the fifth crate.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.594
Droid?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.431
Blast him!

12:11.272 --> 12:12.731
Thank you for stopping by.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.034
Die, you pirate scum!

12:27.205 --> 12:29.123
Well, this is fun.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.916
-What's the plan?
-I don't know.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.042
Ask the droid.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.296
Lando, watch out!

12:40.301 --> 12:41.593
Hey! Get my blaster!

12:47.934 --> 12:49.184
Chopper! Over here.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.689
Got it.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.861
Now you die, Hondo Ohnaka!

13:48.828 --> 13:50.204
I'm rich!

13:52.790 --> 13:54.082
I'm dead!

14:10.725 --> 14:13.185
Well, that was easy.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.729
Very good. Now!

14:22.320 --> 14:23.904
My friend, my friend.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.365
You might not be Calrissian,

14:27.158 --> 14:29.243
but I know one thing you are...

14:31.162 --> 14:33.205
You are a Jedi.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.837
Why didn't you tell me you were a Jedi?

14:41.130 --> 14:43.465
You know, I am an old
Jedi sympathizer.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.968
I know. I wouldn't believe me either,

14:46.052 --> 14:48.303
but one of my best friends was a Jedi.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.472
I'm pretty sure we were friends.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.849
Well, I'm not really a Jedi yet.

14:53.017 --> 14:57.271
Well, then be a pirate Jedi!

14:57.730 --> 15:00.816
We will make an excellent team.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.151
But first, tell me, what is your name?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.820
Your real name.

15:05.697 --> 15:06.822
Ezra Bridger.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.032
Thank you, Ezra Bridger.

15:18.793 --> 15:22.504
Well, you must have
many responsibilities, yes?

15:22.589 --> 15:24.423
Yeah, too many at the moment.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.341
Well, then join my crew,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.594
and I will split it right down the middle,

15:28.678 --> 15:30.095
fifty-forty.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.681
You won't get a better deal than
that, especially from me.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.017
Wait, that's only 90%.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.310
What about the other 10?

15:36.394 --> 15:39.479
You want me to spend that
on expenses, trust me.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.524
Okay, well, how about 0% for me?

15:42.817 --> 15:45.235
I want the generators. All of them.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.864
You have a deal, partner!

15:49.365 --> 15:50.991
This makes me happy!

15:51.659 --> 15:54.786
You get the generators,
and I get you for my crew.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.747
It is good. Let us celebrate!

15:56.831 --> 15:58.749
Droid, droid! Go to the galley

15:58.833 --> 16:01.877
and bring me the most
expensive drink you can

16:01.961 --> 16:03.253
and something for my friend.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.756
Yeah, I think I'll go with him.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.883
Of course, partner.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.176
Don't forget yours!

16:10.053 --> 16:11.428
I don't know what just happened.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.971
Did I just join his crew?

16:14.057 --> 16:17.643
No, no, I don't want to leave the Ghost.
I mean, not really.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.646
Maybe I would make
a pretty good pirate.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.565
Inquisitors don't hunt them, do they?

16:24.901 --> 16:26.068
What is that?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.452
-Vizago!
-You?

16:35.787 --> 16:37.287
What are you doing here?

16:37.497 --> 16:38.705
I...

16:38.790 --> 16:40.832
Wait, Hondo told me
you lost your ship in a bet.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.959
And you believed that swindler?

16:43.086 --> 16:45.962
By the moons of Gozgo,
you are hopelessly gullible!

16:46.047 --> 16:48.548
Hey, I'm not the one
who got locked in his own brig.

16:51.552 --> 16:55.931
He shot me in the back with a stunner,
disabled my droids somehow.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.559
Probably with this.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.770
You must help me reclaim the Horn.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.189
Sorry, but I've got
other things to worry about.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.816
You owe me, remember?

17:06.109 --> 17:09.361
I gave you information,
and it saved your Jedi friend.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.988
I am calling in that favor... Now.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.451
I know what I said earlier, Chop.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.121
Okay, I'll get you your ship,
and then we're even.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.124
Fine with me.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.543
Chopper, get the
generators onboard the Phantom.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.211
My generators?

17:26.295 --> 17:27.963
No, my generators.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.589
Now, come along and behave.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.389
I think you two know each other.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.474
Partner,

17:39.559 --> 17:43.103
how could you let this
dangerous criminal out of the brig?

17:43.187 --> 17:44.813
Save it, partner.

17:45.857 --> 17:46.982
Let's all relax.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.567
I take the generators.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.485
You two split Azmorigan's credits.

17:50.820 --> 17:51.820
Everyone wins.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.864
That is a fair deal.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.032
And it disgusts me.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.993
For once, I agree.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.704
Care to hear my counter-offer?

18:27.982 --> 18:29.357
Excellent work!

18:29.567 --> 18:31.651
I will invest your share wisely.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.737
Thanks a lot, partner!

18:33.905 --> 18:35.155
Keep the Jedi occupied.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.221
What could have
possibly gone wrong now?

19:03.392 --> 19:07.270
I'm sorry, very sorry,
but I do not work with droids.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.661
Well, looks like you get your ship back,
as promised.

19:22.787 --> 19:26.456
Yes, but I lost all my credits
and my generators!

19:26.541 --> 19:29.125
Technically, they were my generators.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.214
I hate children.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.600
Not sure how we're
gonna explain all this.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.313
What do you mean
you know where Hondo will be?

19:56.279 --> 19:57.863
Well, wait. I'm not done.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.407
Then he let Vizago out!

20:00.658 --> 20:02.868
The villain was upon us, I'm telling you!

20:03.035 --> 20:06.204
But young Ezra,
he stood tall in front of me

20:06.289 --> 20:08.081
and withstood a massive...

20:08.165 --> 20:09.624
My friend!

20:10.042 --> 20:12.043
I was just talking about you.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.880
How you and I rescued the generators

20:14.964 --> 20:17.257
from the evil Vizago.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.842
Yeah, that's not true.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.428
You stole the generators and my ship.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.473
What an accusation!

20:26.100 --> 20:27.684
You wound me!

20:28.060 --> 20:29.477
Chopper had the Phantom on autopilot.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.480
Well, that's another
version of the story, I suppose.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.648
I'll tell you what.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.984
You can keep my generators.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.737
They are my gift to you.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.280
Goodbye!

20:42.116 --> 20:44.075
Just so you know, at one time,

20:44.493 --> 20:45.827
I might have joined your crew.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.163
You might...

20:49.999 --> 20:51.583
Ezra.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.586
You truly are a Jedi.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.548
Contact Commander Sato.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.051
Tell him Ezra Bridger
found his generators.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.309
So, you went for a little spin?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.811
-I was just trying to figure things out.
-And did you?

21:11.896 --> 21:13.313
I used to be like Hondo...

21:13.689 --> 21:15.398
Out for myself and alone.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.901
But that's not who I am anymore.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.111
You're on a different path now.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.155
And I have you guys.
