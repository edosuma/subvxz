WEBVTT

00:03.061 --> 00:04.728
Why are you wearing
a Band-Aid?

00:04.730 --> 00:05.995
Halley bit me.

00:05.997 --> 00:08.932
(laughs)
You got beaten up by a girl.

00:08.934 --> 00:11.101
Hey, that's sexist.

00:11.103 --> 00:12.268
You're right.

00:12.270 --> 00:15.138
(laughs)
You got beaten up by a <i>baby.</i>

00:16.108 --> 00:18.441
- Hi. - Hey.
- Hey.

00:18.443 --> 00:20.143
What you got there?
Oh, I grabbed a sandwich

00:20.145 --> 00:21.644
at the food truck
out front.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.513
Wait, n-now, hold on.

00:23.515 --> 00:24.748
Tonight is Friday,

00:24.750 --> 00:26.316
and I believe you know
what that means.

00:26.318 --> 00:29.419
That my fun, young life took
a drastic turn somewhere?

00:30.288 --> 00:31.488
No.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.523
But yeah.

00:33.525 --> 00:36.493
No, that means it's
Chinese food night.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.661
Yeah, and you have Chinese food.
So eat it.

00:38.663 --> 00:41.598
But I can smell your pastrami.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.799
And we can all hear
your complaining,

00:42.801 --> 00:43.967
so no one's happy.

00:45.070 --> 00:46.636
It does smell good.

00:46.638 --> 00:47.937
Oh, it is.
I had one the other day.

00:47.939 --> 00:49.539
(stammers)
What is happening?

00:49.541 --> 00:51.808
Everybody's supposed to be
eating Chinese food.

00:51.810 --> 00:53.510
Well, actually,
I believe the Chinese

00:53.512 --> 00:54.911
may have invented
the sandwich.

00:54.913 --> 00:57.180
Their dish “rou jia mo”
literally means

00:57.182 --> 00:58.982
“meat between bread.”

00:58.984 --> 01:00.750
So, it looks like all
of us, including Penny,

01:00.752 --> 01:02.318
are eating Chinese food.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.120
Except for you, Sheldon.
You're eating crow.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.091
I'm sorry, I think
you're forgetting

01:08.093 --> 01:09.993
that the sandwich
was invented

01:09.995 --> 01:13.096
by John Montagu,
the Earl of Sandwich.

01:13.098 --> 01:15.331
Oh. The truck's called
“Pearl of Sandwich.”

01:15.333 --> 01:17.033
Now I get it.

01:17.035 --> 01:21.004
All right, that smells too good.
I got to get one of those.

01:21.006 --> 01:24.174
And I think you're forgetting
that there are written documents

01:24.176 --> 01:26.743
of meat between bread
being eaten in China

01:26.745 --> 01:28.578
during the Tang dynasty.

01:28.580 --> 01:29.846
You know what,
I'll go with you.

01:29.848 --> 01:32.015
And then maybe we just go home.

01:32.017 --> 01:35.485
I think you're defining
bread very loosely.

01:35.487 --> 01:37.153
If we go down that road,
where does it end?

01:37.155 --> 01:39.122
Well, I would say
when we go to bed,

01:39.124 --> 01:41.257
but you talk
in your sleep.

01:41.259 --> 01:43.092
I don't want to get into this
with you right now.

01:43.094 --> 01:45.528
We'll talk about this
when I'm asleep.

01:46.798 --> 01:49.265
I don't want to talk
about it when you're asleep.

01:49.267 --> 01:51.100
How come we can't
talk about it now?

01:51.102 --> 01:52.502
Well, because I'm eating now.

01:52.504 --> 01:54.971
Fine. How's your moo shu?

01:54.973 --> 01:57.240
You know what?
It's great.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.709
Wait, look at that.

01:59.711 --> 02:03.246
Hmm. Well, maybe the Chinese
did invent the sandwich.

02:05.050 --> 02:06.783
I guess you were right.

02:08.453 --> 02:10.887
Too bad no one's
around to hear it.

02:37.904 --> 02:41.706
I can smell that food truck
from up here.

02:41.707 --> 02:44.074
Just close the window
if you don't like the smell.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.310
Of course I like the smell.

02:46.312 --> 02:48.078
It's salt and fat.

02:49.281 --> 02:51.682
My brain may be evolved,
but my tongue still wants

02:51.684 --> 02:55.052
to pick up a club and drag
that truck back to my cave.

02:55.054 --> 02:56.787
So, there's something
you like,

02:56.789 --> 03:00.090
but it's also
driving you crazy.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.792
Been there, doing it now.

03:03.395 --> 03:05.429
No, it-it's a distraction.

03:05.431 --> 03:06.830
How can I focus on my work

03:06.832 --> 03:09.099
when all I can think about is
how much I want that sandwich?

03:09.101 --> 03:10.567
So, go get one.

03:10.569 --> 03:12.102
I can't just give in
to every urge I have

03:12.104 --> 03:13.103
when I have it.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.172
That's why I have
a rigid schedule.

03:15.174 --> 03:16.807
It's bad enough I had to
give in to my urge

03:16.809 --> 03:19.276
to create a rigid schedule.

03:19.278 --> 03:22.045
You know, why don't I just
go down to the food truck

03:22.047 --> 03:24.181
and ask them to move?

03:24.183 --> 03:26.783
- Why are you taking cash?
- No reason.

03:31.290 --> 03:34.791
Oh, this is the life.

03:34.793 --> 03:36.159
What could be better than this?

03:36.161 --> 03:39.796
If you weren't wearing
one of my swimsuits.

03:39.798 --> 03:41.832
I'll give it back.

03:41.834 --> 03:43.633
(chuckles)
You know the rule--

03:43.635 --> 03:48.105
once it touches hiney,
it's no longer miney.

03:48.107 --> 03:50.007
You're such a prude.

03:50.009 --> 03:52.309
Do you know all the things
this water's touching right now?

03:52.311 --> 03:54.277
Well, I'm relaxed enough.

03:57.649 --> 03:59.416
Hey, Howard, look.

03:59.418 --> 04:01.251
What's that?

04:01.253 --> 04:03.620
Huh.

04:03.622 --> 04:05.922
Looks like someone's drone.

04:05.924 --> 04:07.324
Oh, no.

04:07.326 --> 04:09.192
Do you think it was spying on us
in the hot tub?

04:09.194 --> 04:12.729
'Cause I'm only 40% of the way
to my beach bod.

04:12.731 --> 04:14.731
One of the propellers
is broken.

04:14.733 --> 04:16.298
It must have crashed.

04:16.301 --> 04:18.435
Oh. Do you think
you could fix it?

04:18.437 --> 04:21.605
Maybe. Should we try and
track down the owner first?

04:21.607 --> 04:24.341
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

04:24.343 --> 04:26.343
Anyone lose a drone?

04:28.147 --> 04:29.279
Looks like it's ours.

04:29.281 --> 04:31.181
Yay, we got a drone!
Shh.

04:31.183 --> 04:34.451
(whispers): Oh.
Yay, we got a drone.

04:38.824 --> 04:41.792
(sighs)
The pastrami truck moved.

04:43.429 --> 04:47.364
That is the danger
of a restaurant on wheels.

04:47.366 --> 04:49.666
No, apparently someone
complained

04:49.668 --> 04:50.934
to the tenants association,

04:50.936 --> 04:52.636
and they're not allowed to park
on our street anymore.

04:52.638 --> 04:55.272
Who would complain about
something that everyone loves?

04:55.274 --> 04:57.140
Oh...

04:57.142 --> 04:59.443
Did you complain
to the tenants association

04:59.445 --> 05:00.444
about the food truck?

05:00.446 --> 05:02.479
Yes.

05:03.849 --> 05:05.982
And they actually
took you seriously?

05:05.984 --> 05:09.119
Oh, the tenants association
takes every complaint seriously.

05:09.121 --> 05:11.088
Oh, great, because I'm about
to send them an e-mail

05:11.090 --> 05:14.024
complaining about you.

05:14.026 --> 05:16.093
(phone chimes)

05:16.095 --> 05:18.161
Excuse me.

05:22.935 --> 05:25.235
Wow.

05:25.237 --> 05:29.239
Someone should have
spell-checked.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.607
What is going on here?

05:30.609 --> 05:32.509
You're the tenants
association?

05:32.511 --> 05:35.045
(laughs): You should see
the look on your face.

05:35.981 --> 05:37.414
You might want to
tell your wife

05:37.416 --> 05:40.417
that there's no “Y”
in “pastrami.”

05:43.655 --> 05:46.123
Okay, that ought
to do it.

05:46.125 --> 05:48.158
I've replaced the propeller

05:48.160 --> 05:50.660
and reattached the
gimbal controller unit.

05:50.662 --> 05:54.664
Dude, you're like
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i> for robots.

05:55.634 --> 05:57.801
Also, why isn't that a show?

05:57.803 --> 06:00.403
I just need to see
if I can re-sync

06:00.405 --> 06:02.339
the controls to
this old remote.

06:02.341 --> 06:03.607
We should name it.

06:03.609 --> 06:06.376
The drone, or your
stupid robot show?

06:06.378 --> 06:08.512
The drone.

06:08.514 --> 06:10.280
The show's already got
a name--

06:10.282 --> 06:12.415
<i>General Bot-spital.</i>

06:14.319 --> 06:17.888
I got it working!
(chuckles)

06:17.890 --> 06:19.256
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Oh, oh!

06:19.258 --> 06:20.390
Let's play William Tell.

06:20.392 --> 06:21.858
I'll put this bowl
on my head.

06:21.860 --> 06:25.095
See if you can knock it off
without hitting me.

06:26.098 --> 06:28.965
You read my mind.

06:28.967 --> 06:30.700
What are you doing?

06:30.702 --> 06:35.105
Either breaking a bowl
or breaking Raj's head.

06:35.107 --> 06:37.707
Be careful, they don't
make that bowl anymore.

06:43.916 --> 06:46.183
(chuckles)
It's a nice one.

06:46.185 --> 06:49.186
Yeah. We found it in the yard
and fixed it up.

06:49.188 --> 06:50.687
Aren't you worried there's
some kid out there

06:50.689 --> 06:52.122
missing his drone?

06:52.124 --> 06:53.256
Oh, please, Bernadette,

06:53.258 --> 06:54.758
this is not
a children's toy, okay?

06:54.760 --> 06:56.593
This thing's got
an HD camera on it.

06:56.595 --> 06:58.128
Okay, then aren't you worried
there's some rich

06:58.130 --> 07:00.564
Peeping Tom out there
missing his drone?

07:00.566 --> 07:04.267
We asked around,
and no one claimed it.

07:04.269 --> 07:06.703
Ha. I think we've
done all we can do.

07:07.839 --> 07:09.339
Did you check the video card?

07:09.341 --> 07:11.107
Maybe you can see where
it started off from.

07:11.109 --> 07:14.277
What a great idea, honey.

07:16.715 --> 07:18.014
So, let me get
this straight.

07:18.016 --> 07:20.550
You are the president
of the tenants association?

07:20.552 --> 07:24.721
President, only member,
and harshest critic.

07:24.723 --> 07:27.724
I once gave myself
an official reprimand

07:27.726 --> 07:30.927
for conducting a meeting
in the shower.

07:30.929 --> 07:33.697
The steam warped my gavel.

07:33.699 --> 07:36.433
Okay, so when I got a fine
for leaving my clothes

07:36.435 --> 07:38.602
in the dryer for too long,
that was from you?

07:38.604 --> 07:40.670
$14.99.

07:40.672 --> 07:43.139
The exact price of a new gavel.

07:43.141 --> 07:45.842
And the noise complaint
we got

07:45.844 --> 07:47.944
for singing you
“Happy Birthday”?

07:47.946 --> 07:51.081
As a friend, I was touched.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.549
As a representative
of the building,

07:52.551 --> 07:55.919
I thought that you should
pick a key and stick with it.

07:57.322 --> 07:57.905
Hi.

07:57.929 --> 08:00.310
Do you know he is the entire
tenants association?

08:00.592 --> 08:02.859
No, but I'm not
surprised.

08:02.861 --> 08:06.062
He's also the pope of a planet
he invented in hyperspace.

08:07.933 --> 08:09.299
Why didn't you tell me?

08:09.301 --> 08:11.034
'Cause I wanted to make sure
that you loved the man,

08:11.036 --> 08:12.569
not the office.

08:12.571 --> 08:15.538
You can't just declare
yourself president.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.974
I didn't.
I called a meeting,

08:17.976 --> 08:19.542
I was the only one to attend.

08:19.544 --> 08:22.512
I nominated myself, and after
a pretty moving speech,

08:22.514 --> 08:24.848
I voted myself in.

08:24.850 --> 08:27.317
Well, if you can
vote yourself in,

08:27.319 --> 08:28.718
then we can vote you out.
Yeah.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.317
Fine. Make a motion
at the next meeting.

08:30.341 --> 08:31.289
When is that?

08:31.290 --> 08:32.989
It's the first Saturday
of every month.

08:32.991 --> 08:34.924
Unless there's
an emergency meeting.

08:34.926 --> 08:36.426
Then we call
an emergency meeting.

08:36.428 --> 08:37.494
You really don't have to.

08:37.496 --> 08:39.361
This is the first Saturday
of the month.

08:39.364 --> 08:41.931
Okay, fine.
Then we vote you out.

08:41.933 --> 08:42.999
Uh, uh, hold on.

08:43.001 --> 08:44.534
Hold on. First,

08:44.536 --> 08:47.671
we have to read the minutes
from last month's meeting.

08:47.673 --> 08:50.473
Amy, would you do the honors?

08:50.475 --> 08:52.342
Why not?

08:52.344 --> 08:53.710
“Saturday, March 3rd.

08:53.712 --> 08:56.179
“7:05, meeting called to order.

08:56.181 --> 08:59.549
“7:06, president gets
shampoo in eye.

09:01.253 --> 09:02.986
7:07, meeting adjourned.”

09:02.988 --> 09:05.255
Okay, can we
vote you out now?

09:05.257 --> 09:08.024
Ah, very well. New business.

09:09.895 --> 09:11.728
I move for a vote
of no confidence

09:11.730 --> 09:13.430
in the president.
Yeah.

09:13.432 --> 09:14.831
Two to one, you lose.

09:14.833 --> 09:17.500
Not so fast. I believe
we have one tenant here

09:17.502 --> 09:20.003
who has not made
her voice heard.

09:22.374 --> 09:24.607
Oh...

09:24.609 --> 09:27.277
We're waiting, fiancée.

09:28.513 --> 09:31.915
Yeah, we're waiting,
best friend.

09:31.917 --> 09:32.916
Yeah, we're waiting,

09:32.918 --> 09:35.452
neighbor who needed a battery

09:35.454 --> 09:39.289
and totally got one from me,
no strings attached.

09:39.291 --> 09:42.325
I don't want to be
in the middle of this.

09:42.327 --> 09:44.260
No matter which way I vote,
I'm either

09:44.262 --> 09:46.529
a bad friend,
a bad fiancée,

09:46.531 --> 09:49.699
or an ungrateful recipient
of a battery.

09:49.701 --> 09:51.434
Next time I have a meeting
in the shower,

09:51.436 --> 09:52.569
you're welcome to attend.

09:52.571 --> 09:55.138
Sheldon. Sheldon for president.
I pick Sheldon!

09:59.246 --> 10:02.076
Ugh, I can't believe my best
friend sided with Sheldon.

10:02.077 --> 10:05.546
Can't believe my best friend
<i>is</i> Sheldon.

10:05.548 --> 10:07.848
Ah, I should've taken
that gavel

10:07.850 --> 10:09.950
and shoved it right down
 his throat.
- Ugh.

10:09.952 --> 10:10.951
I would've gone the other way,

10:10.953 --> 10:13.120
but it would've gotten
to his throat.

10:13.856 --> 10:15.355
What?

10:15.357 --> 10:16.623
Don't be mad at me.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.091
I mean, I can't vote
against him.

10:18.093 --> 10:19.526
Even when he's being crazy?

10:19.528 --> 10:21.528
Well, what other times
are there?!

10:21.530 --> 10:24.064
So you just let him get
away with anything?

10:24.066 --> 10:25.866
Well, not anything.

10:25.868 --> 10:27.668
But honestly,
pastrami sandwich

10:27.670 --> 10:29.636
is not the hill
I want to die on.

10:29.638 --> 10:31.471
It's not about
the sandwich.

10:31.473 --> 10:32.739
It's about
the principle.

10:32.741 --> 10:33.674
Yeah, principle.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.410
And a little bit sandwich.
Yeah.

10:36.412 --> 10:38.845
Look, there are a bunch of other
tenants in this building.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.248
All you need is for one of them
to vote your way,

10:41.250 --> 10:43.216
and then Sheldon's out
and I didn't betray him.

10:43.218 --> 10:45.085
Hey, you know, that's
actually a good plan.

10:45.087 --> 10:48.355
That you came up with
all by yourself.

10:49.658 --> 10:52.025
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:52.027 --> 10:53.727
told Sheldon
I was going to the market,

10:53.729 --> 10:56.964
so... I'm taking
some of your stuff.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:05.941 --> 11:07.941
I was never here.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.113
Sometimes you don't see it
'cause she's next to Sheldon,

11:13.115 --> 11:15.082
but she's pretty weird.

11:17.152 --> 11:20.020
Okay. All hooked up.
Here we go.

11:20.022 --> 11:22.255
I hope there's nothing
disturbing on there.

11:22.257 --> 11:24.424
Like you two in a hot tub?

11:26.395 --> 11:28.762
Hold on.
Now I'm getting a picture.

11:33.002 --> 11:34.835
That's not very
much to go on.

11:34.837 --> 11:38.138
Oh, that's plenty to go on.

11:39.775 --> 11:41.008
We can't give up.

11:41.010 --> 11:43.577
We got to find her.

11:43.579 --> 11:46.146
You just want to find
her 'cause she's cute.

11:46.148 --> 11:48.281
Not just because she's cute.

11:48.283 --> 11:49.850
She also owns
a pretty expensive drone,

11:49.852 --> 11:51.952
which means she has money
and doesn't mind wasting it.

11:51.954 --> 11:54.921
And I... I like that in a woman.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.558
Do you see anything that could
help us locate her?

11:58.560 --> 11:59.893
Hmm, let me have a look.

11:59.895 --> 12:01.061
She's got eagle eyes,

12:01.063 --> 12:03.463
always spotting continuity
errors in movies.

12:03.465 --> 12:06.700
(chuckles)
It's not annoying at all.

12:06.702 --> 12:08.568
Oh. There.

12:08.570 --> 12:09.836
Right there.

12:09.838 --> 12:11.405
Check out the pin
on her jacket.

12:11.407 --> 12:13.106
Isn't that from
the comic book store?

12:13.108 --> 12:14.241
Hmm, is it?

12:14.243 --> 12:16.209
Hey, Howard, zoom in.
Oh.

12:16.211 --> 12:19.713
Fine. Zooming in.
(whooshes)

12:21.517 --> 12:23.216
Yeah, I know
you're being a jerk,

12:23.218 --> 12:25.619
but it's actually helpful.

12:27.790 --> 12:28.989
Hi.

12:28.991 --> 12:30.724
Hi. We're your neighbors
from downstairs.

12:30.726 --> 12:31.958
We've met.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.094
Remember?

12:34.096 --> 12:35.996
I invited you to my housewarming
when I moved in.

12:35.998 --> 12:37.597
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

12:37.599 --> 12:39.266
You know, it's been
a crazy couple months.

12:39.268 --> 12:41.034
That was two years ago.

12:42.871 --> 12:46.006
Welcome to the building.
Mm-hmm.

12:46.008 --> 12:49.209
So, I-I'm running for president
of the tenants association.

12:49.211 --> 12:50.577
I could really use your vote.

12:50.579 --> 12:52.279
You said you were gonna stop by.

12:52.281 --> 12:54.214
I bought a lot of food.

12:54.216 --> 12:56.950
Anyway, meeting's tomorrow.

12:56.952 --> 12:58.318
We really hope
you can make it.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.153
I'll be there.
Oh, really?

13:00.155 --> 13:02.923
Yeah. You should buy
a lot of food.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.761
So, I'm running for president
of the tenants association

13:07.763 --> 13:09.296
and I could really use
your vote.

13:09.298 --> 13:10.430
Uh, who's president now?

13:10.432 --> 13:11.765
Uh, Sheldon Cooper.

13:11.767 --> 13:13.200
You know, about yay tall

13:13.202 --> 13:15.001
and about yay annoying.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.371
So you want me to vote
against Sheldon Cooper?

13:18.373 --> 13:19.873
Yeah. You just need
to show up at a meeting...

13:19.875 --> 13:21.241
Oh, no, no. No can do.

13:21.243 --> 13:23.543
He's got a restraining order
against me.

13:23.545 --> 13:25.412
Really? Why?

13:25.414 --> 13:26.847
Uh, I locked him
on the roof once.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.082
(whispers):
Three times.

13:30.119 --> 13:32.018
So, Mrs. Petrescu,

13:32.020 --> 13:33.653
we were hoping you would vote
for Leonard

13:33.655 --> 13:35.021
instead of voting for Sheldon.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.023
Vote Sheldon.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.626
No, no. Vote Leonard.

13:39.628 --> 13:42.162
No vote Leonard.

13:42.164 --> 13:46.399
No. Vote Leonard.

13:46.401 --> 13:48.769
Thank you.

13:52.007 --> 13:54.307
She's wearing a pin
from your store.

13:54.309 --> 13:55.642
Do you know who she is?

13:55.644 --> 13:56.977
Oh, sure, yeah.
That's Cynthia.

13:56.979 --> 13:59.079
Wha... s-so,
she's a customer?

13:59.081 --> 14:01.581
Yeah, yeah, but I-I haven't
seen her in a while.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.250
And before you say anything,

14:03.252 --> 14:05.585
there is a lot of reasons
women stop coming here.

14:05.587 --> 14:07.454
It's not just me.

14:07.456 --> 14:09.656
But this time...

14:09.658 --> 14:10.891
It was me. Yeah.

14:12.027 --> 14:15.729
I was trying out
a flirty new smile.

14:19.668 --> 14:22.736
Now, I don't use the word

14:22.738 --> 14:26.072
“ghoulish” a lot, but...

14:26.074 --> 14:29.075
I-I just can't think
of another word.

14:30.112 --> 14:32.646
Wait, do you know
how to find her?

14:32.648 --> 14:35.215
Yeah. I think I have her
address on my mailing list.

14:35.217 --> 14:37.551
Oh. Hey. Please, let me bring
the drone back to her.

14:37.553 --> 14:39.352
You think you've got a shot?

14:39.354 --> 14:41.354
What if she's married?
She's not.

14:41.356 --> 14:43.323
It's meant to be.

14:43.325 --> 14:44.624
A little tip.

14:44.626 --> 14:47.828
Uh, stick with the smiles
you know.

14:52.668 --> 14:54.401
Hi. What are you doing?

14:54.403 --> 14:57.270
Leonard and Penny are trying
to turn the tenants against me,

14:57.272 --> 14:59.739
so they are about to see
just what kind of power

14:59.741 --> 15:02.209
the president of
the tenants association wields.

15:03.512 --> 15:07.447
“You must be at least this tall
to use washing machine”?

15:07.449 --> 15:11.151
I'm gonna hang it up
higher than Leonard.

15:11.153 --> 15:14.054
And then his clothes
will smell.

15:14.056 --> 15:16.890
And nobody's voting for a man
with smelly clothes.

15:16.892 --> 15:18.892
No, not when there's
a perfectly unscented

15:18.894 --> 15:20.227
incumbent on the ballot.

15:20.229 --> 15:23.230
Sheldon, I have
an advanced degree

15:23.232 --> 15:24.698
in the study of
the human brain,

15:24.700 --> 15:27.000
so if my fiancé
is a raving lunatic,

15:27.002 --> 15:29.035
it's kind of a ding
on my reputation.

15:29.037 --> 15:32.138
If leaders
just stepped aside

15:32.140 --> 15:34.274
every time they didn't have
the consent of the governed,

15:34.276 --> 15:35.308
what would we have?

15:35.310 --> 15:38.078
Democracy.

15:38.947 --> 15:40.513
Not on my watch.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.020
Okay. Don't be weird.

15:47.022 --> 15:49.322
Don't be weird.
Don't be weird.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.591
(deep voice):
Hello.

15:51.593 --> 15:54.027
Hey. You found my drone.

15:54.029 --> 15:55.128
(normal voice):
Yeah, yeah. Yes.

15:55.130 --> 15:56.830
It took a while
to track you down,

15:56.832 --> 15:59.466
but to see the look on
your face, it was worth it.

15:59.468 --> 16:01.601
Aw, that's sweet.

16:01.603 --> 16:03.370
Rajesh.

16:03.372 --> 16:05.071
Cynthia.
Ah, pleasure to meet you.

16:05.073 --> 16:07.107
Likewise.

16:07.109 --> 16:09.809
I-I feel like I should give you
a reward or something.

16:09.811 --> 16:11.378
Oh, oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.312
No, I insist.

16:12.314 --> 16:13.880
How about your
phone number?

16:13.882 --> 16:16.583
Give me your phone.

16:20.622 --> 16:24.157
Thanks. So, I'll-I'll
call you, Cynthia.

16:24.159 --> 16:26.092
Great, Rajesh.
(both chuckle)

16:26.094 --> 16:27.694
And thanks again.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.129
Uh, sure.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.433
(phone rings)

16:33.435 --> 16:35.902
Just checking.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.940
(knocking, door opens)

16:39.942 --> 16:41.641
Hey, Sheldon.

16:41.643 --> 16:45.845
We found something
pretty interesting.

16:45.847 --> 16:49.449
Huh. Well, that is surprising.

16:49.451 --> 16:53.253
I, for one, have no idea
what they're talking about.

16:53.255 --> 16:55.889
Turns out, when Amy took over
Penny's apartment,

16:55.891 --> 16:58.591
she was put on the lease,
not you.

16:58.593 --> 17:00.260
PENNY: Yeah, and when I
moved across the hall,

17:00.262 --> 17:02.595
you got taken off the
lease and I got added.

17:02.597 --> 17:04.664
Well, what are you saying?

17:04.665 --> 17:06.800
That Sheldon's not
technically a tenant at all

17:06.801 --> 17:09.868
and therefore,
has no standing to be president

17:09.871 --> 17:12.973
of the tenants association
no matter who votes for him?

17:13.909 --> 17:15.742
I don't know
how you found that out,

17:15.743 --> 17:18.111
but I am guessing
all on your own.

17:18.113 --> 17:20.646
So, looks like
we need to figure out

17:20.648 --> 17:22.147
who the new president
should be.

17:22.150 --> 17:23.750
I nominate myself.
I second it.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.785
Huh.

17:25.787 --> 17:28.989
Well, as a woman in love,
I want to stand by my man.

17:28.991 --> 17:32.292
Too bad that's been rendered
bureaucratically impossible.

17:34.162 --> 17:36.896
Well, this is hard for me

17:36.898 --> 17:39.566
because I do love
a legal technicality

17:39.568 --> 17:41.001
and this is a good one.

17:41.003 --> 17:44.938
Although, not quite as good as
the provision in California law,

17:44.940 --> 17:47.674
which states a person
who occupies a dwelling

17:47.676 --> 17:51.978
for 30 consecutive days becomes
a tenant at will and as such...

17:51.980 --> 17:54.547
I vote for Leonard!
You...

17:54.549 --> 17:55.882
What?

17:55.884 --> 17:57.917
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

17:57.919 --> 18:00.854
With minimal power comes
minimal responsibility,

18:00.856 --> 18:03.256
and you couldn't handle it.

18:03.258 --> 18:07.227
Don't you misquote <i>Spider-Man</i>
to me.

18:07.229 --> 18:08.194
It's not your fault.

18:08.196 --> 18:10.463
I mean, what man
wouldn't be seduced

18:10.465 --> 18:13.933
by the power to decide how late
the laundry room stays open?

18:13.935 --> 18:16.069
Wait, you're the reason
I had to come back

18:16.071 --> 18:17.904
and get my jeans
the next morning?

18:19.274 --> 18:21.808
I can't believe you expect
me to give that up.

18:23.345 --> 18:25.545
Sheldon,
it's the American way,

18:25.547 --> 18:27.313
the peaceful transfer
of power.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.748
I don't know.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.617
Think about <i>Ant-Man.</i>

18:30.619 --> 18:34.187
I'm always thinking
about <i>Ant-Man.</i>

18:34.189 --> 18:35.588
Michael Douglas had the suit

18:35.590 --> 18:38.158
and then he passed it on
to Paul Rudd.

18:40.062 --> 18:41.895
Maybe you're right.

18:41.897 --> 18:43.363
Really?
The <i>Ant-Man</i> thing?

18:43.365 --> 18:45.432
That's what won you over?

18:45.434 --> 18:47.200
Yes. He got the details right.

18:47.202 --> 18:48.768
That's how you use
a superhero.

18:48.770 --> 18:50.437
Mm.

18:50.439 --> 18:53.440
I suppose it is time I
passed this on to Leonard.

18:53.442 --> 18:55.141
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks.

18:55.143 --> 18:57.010
I-I know that's hard for you.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.511
Well, it was.

18:58.513 --> 18:59.946
But you know what?

18:59.948 --> 19:01.781
Instead of being in charge,

19:01.783 --> 19:04.551
I can now be
the vocal opposition,

19:04.553 --> 19:08.021
criticizing and badgering
the president at every turn.

19:08.023 --> 19:11.424
I think you'll be
really good at that.

19:11.426 --> 19:13.426
Me, too.

19:13.428 --> 19:17.297
I think I've made
a huge mistake.

19:17.299 --> 19:19.365
Me, too.

19:24.124 --> 19:25.791
Can't believe you
got her number.

19:25.793 --> 19:27.592
I know, right?

19:27.594 --> 19:30.028
How amazing would it be
if this worked out

19:30.030 --> 19:31.763
and the story
of how I met my wife

19:31.765 --> 19:34.633
started with you and me
in the hot tub together.

19:36.403 --> 19:41.239
Well, do us both a favor
and start the story later.

19:41.241 --> 19:42.741
Whatever.

19:42.743 --> 19:44.643
I have a good feeling
about this girl.

19:44.645 --> 19:46.211
Like, we really hit it off.

19:46.213 --> 19:48.146
Stop flying it around.

19:48.148 --> 19:49.648
You're gonna break it.

19:49.650 --> 19:51.416
Why do you care?

19:51.418 --> 19:54.886
Because we have to give it back
to the beautiful mystery girl.

19:54.888 --> 19:56.154
Aw.

19:56.156 --> 19:57.856
I mean, did you see
how hot she was?

19:57.858 --> 20:00.792
I want to get all up on that
and start making babies!

20:00.794 --> 20:03.695
I know exactly what underwear

20:03.697 --> 20:06.398
I'm gonna wear
on our first date.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.866
None!
