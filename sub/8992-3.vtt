00:00.751 --> 00:01.919
Maddie: <i>Previously on</i>
Recovery Road.

00:01.919 --> 00:03.837
It's vodka.
We found this in
Maddie's locker.

00:03.837 --> 00:08.509
24 hours of detox and 90 days
at a sober living facility
effective immediately.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.469
Look what I got us.
Ta‐da!

00:10.469 --> 00:13.138
You're kidding me.
I'm committed to my
recovery this time.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.306
Why the hell do you
think I'm here?

00:14.306 --> 00:16.725
I can tell you like her, Wes,
so you and Maddie can't happen.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.268
‐Are we clear?
‐We're clear.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.311
What happened?

00:19.311 --> 00:21.021
This was in my car.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.607
I don't
remember what happened
on Thursday night.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.485
I've never
had sex before.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.820
No one thinks that
I can get my little
girl back.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.031
Charlotte: <i>Maddie,</i>
<i>she's not volunteering.</i>

00:31.031 --> 00:33.659
She's actually kind of
going through it right now.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.369
Rebecca's not
my girl friend.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.204
I just thought that
was the reason you
were avoiding me.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.580
I'm not ignoring you now.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.748
Am I?

00:41.833 --> 00:44.461
(rock music playing)

01:12.155 --> 01:13.240
(inaudible)

01:18.996 --> 01:20.080
Maddie:
<i>I don't know this girl.</i>

01:21.665 --> 01:23.959
<i>But I can tell she wasn't</i>
<i>always the way she is now.</i>

01:27.379 --> 01:29.089
<i>The way he looked at her.</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:33.385
<i>The way she looked at him.</i>

01:35.304 --> 01:37.347
<i>He wanted desperately</i>
<i>to help her.</i>

01:38.599 --> 01:40.392
<i>And even though</i>
<i>she couldn't admit it...</i>

01:42.311 --> 01:43.979
<i>she wanted desperately</i>
<i>to be saved.</i>

01:45.731 --> 01:48.233
Wes: I don't know,
it's like they're all mixed up
together in my brain...

01:49.318 --> 01:53.113
sex, drugs,
love, alcohol.

01:54.323 --> 01:58.118
It's hard to figure out
where one starts
and the other one stops.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.497
I guess they kind of
feel the same...

02:04.124 --> 02:05.125
don't they?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.461
Love? Drugs?

02:13.508 --> 02:14.676
Craig:
Good share, Wes.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.305
All right.
You're up, Maddie.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.557
(clears throat)
I'll pass.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.809
Hey, Maddie,
no more passes now.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.478
You've got to
start sharing.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.314
It's time for you to take
an active role in your recovery.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.107
(clearing throat)

02:29.107 --> 02:30.233
Fine.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.276
So I was thinking‐‐

02:31.276 --> 02:32.903
(sing‐song)
What's your name?

02:33.904 --> 02:35.155
Hi, I'm Maddie.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.408
So I was thinking‐‐

02:38.408 --> 02:39.576
And?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.953
And I'm Maddie.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.538
You're supposed to say
you're an alcoholic.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.835
And I'm Maddie.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.423
All: Hi, Maddie.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.678
So, I was thinking about
Springtime Meadows
and how it all works here.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.888
‐That's great!
‐It is.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.475
Anyway, I was thinking
how if everyone in the house

03:03.475 --> 03:07.104
chipped in so we could hire
a service to clean the bathroom
once a week.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.230
(laughing)

03:08.230 --> 03:11.149
It would give me lot
more time to focus
on my recovery

03:11.149 --> 03:14.111
and helping the economy
by giving someone a job.
Win‐win.

03:14.111 --> 03:18.657
All right. Time's up.
Everyone remember to check
the weekend chore sheets,

03:18.657 --> 03:21.368
and since we won't be hiring
a cleaning service anytime soon,

03:21.368 --> 03:24.496
I do believe you are still
on bathroom cleanup, Maddie.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.959
Vern: Good stuff
in group today.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.461
I'm really proud of you, Wes.
You're really making really
good discoveries.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.338
‐Thanks, man.
‐Lots of progress.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.840
What did Socrates say?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.675
"The unexamined life
is not worth living."

03:37.717 --> 03:40.303
But then again, Socrates
wasn't a meth‐head.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.304
That we know of.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.725
(cell phone vibrating)

03:48.770 --> 03:49.813
What's that?

03:52.858 --> 03:53.984
Wrong number.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.571
Your girlfriend is here.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.281
‐Hey!
‐Hey.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.659
Please forgive Margarita.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.996
She still hasn't quite grasped
the concept of me being
really, really gay.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.331
Well, I was your girlfriend...
in high school.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.584
Yeah, back when I was
still really, really gay.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.712
I have to say
you were fun...

04:13.712 --> 04:15.630
you got all my musical
theater references...

04:15.630 --> 04:18.091
you were actually
the best boyfriend
I've ever had.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.676
That is really sad.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.303
I'm gonna pray for you.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.638
Both of you.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.932
And Jesus loves
attempted murders
too, right?

04:28.310 --> 04:29.561
(snickering)

04:29.561 --> 04:30.854
I can't with her.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.983
‐Where's Paul?
‐Oh, you teach me the steps,
and I'll just teach him.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.320
So he couldn't make the time
to come and learn the first
dance to his own wedding?

04:38.320 --> 04:41.156
He had already committed
to a golf game, and he couldn't
get out of it.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.532
Meaning, he doesn't
really like me.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.534
You're not exactly a member
of his fan club either.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.244
I like Paul.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.622
(haltingly)
He was almost fun
that one time.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.831
You don't have to
like each other.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.004
So I was thinking
maybe a waltz.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.464
Ew, Cinderella. No.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.007
‐(scoffs)
‐I have an idea.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.426
Salsa.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.136
(exclaiming)

05:08.475 --> 05:11.394
Harper: <i>Baby, I need you.</i>

05:11.394 --> 05:14.940
<i>I‐‐ I need help.</i>
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to keep using.</i>

05:16.566 --> 05:18.443
<i>Please, baby.</i>

05:18.443 --> 05:20.237
<i>Can you come get me?</i>

05:24.825 --> 05:26.451
(theme song playing)

05:27.452 --> 05:32.165
<i>♪ This time is my own time,</i>
<i>so step aside ♪</i>

05:32.165 --> 05:34.709
Harper: <i>I need help.</i>
<i>I don't want to keep using.</i>

05:35.710 --> 05:37.462
<i>Please, baby.</i>

05:37.462 --> 05:39.506
<i>Can you come get me?</i>

05:39.506 --> 05:41.466
I'm going to try and talk
her into coming back here.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.968
Oh! No. You're not.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.636
Did you hear her?
She needs me.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.304
No, Wes.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.597
She needs treatment.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.267
And you need to be focusing
on your own sobriety right now,
not Harper's.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.978
Aren't we supposed to be
of service to others?

05:52.978 --> 05:55.814
Okay. I'm going to send
somebody else. Maybe couple of
the women in the house can go.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.357
She called me.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.984
She won't come back
here for anyone else.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.735
Fine. I will go then.

06:00.735 --> 06:01.903
She hates you.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.280
‐We're done here.
‐Hey! Hey! Hey!

06:05.657 --> 06:06.825
She's probably holding.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.119
I'm not letting
you go alone.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.912
‐(Spanish music playing)
‐One, two, three, four.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.497
One, two, three, four.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.832
One, two, three, four.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.500
Turn, two, three, four.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.918
(rhythmically)
First I want you,

06:16.918 --> 06:18.461
then I have you.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.172
Shake your maracas, girl.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.842
Now you can sit.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.051
Yeah, impressive.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.845
Oh, you should
see me pole dance.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.471
Well, I'd rather not.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.556
Wes and I are gonna go out.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.141
Will you give Jamison
his discharge papers?

06:31.141 --> 06:34.060
Oh, and make sure Margarita
takes it easy on the spice.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.146
Last time she cooked dinner,
I lost the feeling in my tongue.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.606
Where are you guys going?

06:37.606 --> 06:38.648
12‐step call.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.983
Who?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.359
Harper.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.403
Harper? Wes's Harper?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.446
Yup.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.697
Whoa, you're gonna
let him see her?

06:45.697 --> 06:46.698
Yeah.

06:47.782 --> 06:48.992
You think that's
a good idea?

06:48.992 --> 06:51.995
Oh, no, no, no.
I think it's a terrible idea,

06:51.995 --> 06:53.455
but tell me how
I can stop him.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.333
Want me to go?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.460
No, no, I've got it.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.295
Wait, wait.
How's Maddie doing?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.715
Well, let's see.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.509
Last night at the dinner table
she pretended to overdose.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.928
So, that wasn't funny.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.680
It was a little bit funny.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.931
Really?

07:11.931 --> 07:14.309
She's not taking
it seriously, Cynthia.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.102
And I'm afraid
I've got to the point now‐‐

07:16.102 --> 07:17.354
Hey, why not take
Maddie with you?

07:18.772 --> 07:19.856
It might be good for her.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.150
Maybe she'll learn
something that'll really
look at the disease.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.405
Okay.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.658
Yeah.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.243
Plus that's some
reality check.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.328
Yeah.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.331
Laurel.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.625
Laurel, this is
the best day
of my life.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.001
You got the job
at Urban Sheik?

07:40.001 --> 07:42.253
‐No, I didn't.
‐Yes!

07:42.253 --> 07:44.255
Oh, you didn't?
So why is today‐‐

07:44.255 --> 07:47.717
Because that's the universe's
way of telling me that I'm meant
for something bigger.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.804
Okay, so I filled out,
like five applications
at the mall, right?

07:50.804 --> 07:54.140
But no one would even
look at them because I don't
have any retail experience.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.476
And did you know that
shopping does not count?

07:57.477 --> 08:01.147
Okay, so I went
to Orange Julius
and guess who I met?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.024
The manager who
offered you a job?

08:03.024 --> 08:07.028
No. A lady whose son
is one of the casting
directors of <i>Fool House.</i>

08:08.363 --> 08:09.698
My favorite show!

08:09.698 --> 08:12.158
And she said
she would give my audition
tape directly to him.

08:12.158 --> 08:16.955
Oh, I hate to tell you this,
but that show has been off
the air for several decades.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.999
No, not <i>Full House.</i>
<i>Fool House.</i>

08:19.999 --> 08:22.544
‐Uh‐‐
‐F‐O‐O‐L. <i>Fool House.</i>

08:22.544 --> 08:24.462
‐The reality show.
‐Oh, my gosh,
I love that show.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.923
‐What is it?
‐It's like <i>Big Brother,</i>
only not as classy.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.091
Oh, dear.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.969
And I'm not classy at all,
so I'm perfect for this.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.763
I've always wanted to be
on this show, and now
I have an in.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.682
And if I got the job
at Urban Sheik,

08:35.682 --> 08:39.144
I wouldn't have been
at Orange Julius and
I would've never met that lady.

08:39.144 --> 08:42.230
You guys, it's a sign
from my higher power,

08:42.230 --> 08:43.982
who I choose
to call Beyoncé.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.485
Ah, Maddie,
you're coming
with me.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.320
‐I am?
‐Mmm. Field trip.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.656
‐You're letting me
leave the house?
‐Yes.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.700
‐Can we go to Sephora?
‐No.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.660
‐Pinkberry?
‐Possibly.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.995
‐I'll get my bag.
‐Mmm.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.373
Harper...

09:00.373 --> 09:02.208
Harper, pick up
the phone.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.127
(dramatic music playing)

09:25.648 --> 09:26.983
Let's go.
What are you
waiting for?

09:26.983 --> 09:30.195
Oh, Maddie. Yes.
She just went to
get her purse.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.155
You're joking, right?

09:32.155 --> 09:34.741
Oh, yeah, that's me,
the eternal jokester.

09:34.741 --> 09:35.992
Why in hell
are we bringing her?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.995
Mr. Stewart...

09:38.995 --> 09:41.372
"The primary purpose
of every alcoholic

09:41.372 --> 09:44.542
"is to carry the message
to the alcoholic who
still suffers."

09:44.542 --> 09:46.795
Maddie has no message.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.589
She has no program.
She doesn't even think
she has a problem.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.341
Yeah. Exactly.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.968
Ready?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.804
All right. Ready.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.394
Chivalry is officially dead.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.530
Okay. Tips for audition
videos on <i>Fool House.</i>

10:16.282 --> 10:18.326
Ugh! Boring.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.374
Okay. Okay.
Start filming me.

10:24.374 --> 10:27.961
I've seen every season
of this show, so I know
exactly what they want. Okay.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.797
So here's my plan.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.382
I'm very likable.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.300
Hell, I'm lovable,

10:34.300 --> 10:37.137
so everyone in the house
will want to be my friend.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.473
But... surprise.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.143
I'm a conniving,
backstabbing bitch, too.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.187
I'm all about big moves
and a social game.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.023
And maybe even
a showmance.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.984
‐Wait, what's a showmance?
‐(knocking on door)

10:50.984 --> 10:52.652
Ooh, maybe it's a new admit.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.362
Film me while
I'm opening the door.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.828
Um‐‐ I'm‐‐
Hi. Charlotte.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.079
Trish: It's just you!

11:03.079 --> 11:04.789
Maddie, your
mama's here.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.375
I think
that she left.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.795
Craig told me
to come by
and see her.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.338
Craig forgets
things sometimes.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.007
Like passwords,
birthdays.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.135
Ooh, and he left the oven on
last month and almost burned
down the whole damn house.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.846
‐(Trish laughs)
‐Maybe she's collecting
money for UNICEF.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.308
Or maybe she went
to the farmer's market
for kiwi.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.436
Maybe she went
on a journey
of self discovery.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.147
No, Craig specifically
said to swing by.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.940
Ooh, I smell conflict.

11:30.940 --> 11:35.445
This would be an excellent
opportunity to, as we say
in reality speak,

11:35.445 --> 11:36.821
"stir the pot."

11:36.821 --> 11:38.156
(shouts) Vern!

11:38.156 --> 11:40.116
Maddie's mom is here
and she is pissed.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.327
Just play along, okay?

11:42.327 --> 11:43.661
(Spanish music playing)

11:46.748 --> 11:48.583
Cynthia?

11:48.583 --> 11:50.460
‐Charlotte!
‐Do you know
where Maddie is?

11:52.921 --> 11:54.047
(clears throat)

11:54.047 --> 11:55.506
You must be Maddie's mom.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.217
Same beautiful eyes.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.135
I'm Vern. Do you want
me to get this stuff
for you?

12:00.303 --> 12:03.348
Craig must've forgotten
you were coming. He took
Maddie on a 12‐step call.

12:03.348 --> 12:07.644
Yeah, uh‐‐ He took her with him
to help out a girl who started
using again.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.647
Wait.

12:10.647 --> 12:15.151
He took her to hang out
with an addict without
consulting me?

12:15.151 --> 12:17.987
Well, sometimes seeing
the truth of addiction can
really help with recovery.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.823
How is...

12:20.823 --> 12:23.660
taking her to a place
where there are drugs
helping her?

12:24.786 --> 12:26.996
Oh, look,
there's Naked Guy.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.414
Jasper! Upstairs!

12:28.414 --> 12:30.166
He feels really
oppressed by clothing,

12:30.166 --> 12:32.710
so he gets to be naked
every third Saturday
of the month.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.837
Sorry about that.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.798
Should we take this
to Craig's office?

12:36.798 --> 12:37.882
Yeah, good idea.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.929
Why'd you have to kick her
out in the first place, man?

12:42.929 --> 12:46.933
Because the house
has zero tolerance
for drug or alcohol use.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.060
You use,
you lose, you move.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.020
Uh. Sorry to interrupt.
But where exactly
are we going?

12:51.020 --> 12:52.146
We're going on
what is called a‐‐

12:52.146 --> 12:53.731
We're going to help
someone who should've never

12:53.731 --> 12:55.233
have gotten where
she did in the first place.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.026
So, what am I
supposed to do?

12:57.026 --> 12:58.194
‐Nothing.
‐Learn.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.823
Then can we go
to Pinkberry?

13:05.743 --> 13:08.079
I don't really
buy the whole...

13:09.622 --> 13:11.833
God thing.

13:11.833 --> 13:15.712
Hey, it doesn't have to be
an old man with a beard
in the sky.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.089
It can be anything.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.174
You know,
it can be nature.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.969
Like the ocean
or it can be the group.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.639
All you have to believe
is that there is a god,

13:26.639 --> 13:27.849
and it isn't you.

13:29.892 --> 13:30.935
Hey!

13:32.437 --> 13:33.604
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

13:48.661 --> 13:50.204
You don't know me.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.623
You don't care
about me.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.127
None of you do.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.631
Baby...

14:02.133 --> 14:03.134
come with me.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.095
Okay?
We don't need them.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.149
Fine.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.153
Well, you know
where to find me

14:22.153 --> 14:25.490
when you realize that
all of this is a joke.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.824
(door opens)

14:28.826 --> 14:29.952
(door slams shut)

14:36.125 --> 14:37.418
I have to go
to the bathroom.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.836
Come on.
You've got to
be kidding me.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.338
Nope. True story.
I have to go.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.256
I'm also breathing air.
The audacity, right?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.133
‐Seriously?
‐I'll pull over, okay?

14:45.134 --> 14:46.135
Thanks. (sighs)

14:49.347 --> 14:50.932
Mouthwash contains alcohol.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.683
Can't have it at
Springtime Meadows.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.770
Perfume. Same thing.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.688
People drink perfume?

14:58.689 --> 14:59.899
Both: Yup.

14:59.899 --> 15:04.028
(scoffs) I highly doubt
my daughter has any interest
in drinking perfume.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.696
Cynthia: Maddie isn't
the only one who lives here.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.740
It's just better if you
take that stuff home with you.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.411
Someone going
to drink her jewelry, too?

15:12.411 --> 15:14.413
What do you get when you
sober up a horse thief?

15:14.413 --> 15:15.665
A sober horse thief.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.795
Can you and I
talk in private?

15:20.795 --> 15:23.965
Oh, just pretend
I'm not here. It'll be
kind of like my adolescence.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.469
You completely
misrepresented
this place.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.596
It is total chaos here.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.473
There is no one
in charge.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.059
There are thieves
and naked people,

15:35.059 --> 15:37.562
and perfume drinkers,
and worst of all,

15:37.562 --> 15:40.815
they are putting my daughter
in danger by taking her
to rescue some junkie

15:40.815 --> 15:43.484
‐God knows where.
‐I understand how
this looks.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.904
But despite appearances,
this is the best place
for Maddie to be right now.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.490
And yet, she isn't
here, is she?

15:51.534 --> 15:54.245
I'm going to call her
and just make sure that
she's okay.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.038
Sorry, she hasn't
earned her phone
back yet.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.960
Fine.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.297
I will wait right here
until Maddie gets back.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.011
(mouths)

16:22.899 --> 16:24.984
Bringing her
was a bad idea.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.820
This isn't
about you, Wes.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.822
It's about a girl
who needs our help.

16:29.822 --> 16:34.368
What? By showing her just
how far someone can sink?
By rubbing her face in it?

16:35.369 --> 16:36.495
Sure.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.416
I wasn't talking about Maddie.
I was talking about Harper.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.675
Reception here sucks.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.100
(sighs)

17:05.942 --> 17:07.026
(sighs)

17:11.405 --> 17:12.657
Was she his girlfriend?

17:13.991 --> 17:15.034
Yup.

17:17.495 --> 17:18.746
How long were
they together?

17:20.414 --> 17:21.582
I don't know.

17:26.504 --> 17:27.797
So why did they
break up?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.222
Come on, answer me.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.307
(sighs)

17:38.307 --> 17:39.809
What was she like?

17:40.851 --> 17:42.728
She was a girl who thought
she had it all under control.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.148
Wes: She's not picking up.
Let's go.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.191
Now I need to go.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.317
Are you kidding me?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.153
All right, Wes,
you need to listen
to me right now.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.697
I go on several
of these a month.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.032
It's my job.
I'm good at it.

17:55.032 --> 17:58.703
If Harper goes off the deep end
in the 45 seconds it takes me
to go and urinate,

17:58.703 --> 18:00.830
I will spend the rest of
my life with that regret.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.124
But right now I'd rather
do that in dry trousers.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.167
So, if you would
very kindly shut up

18:05.167 --> 18:08.879
and let me go and pee,
I would be ever so
bloody grateful, mate.

18:12.675 --> 18:13.801
Thank you.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.976
I hope your friend
is going to be okay.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.445
You sure you don't
want anything?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.613
Yup.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.784
Look, I was a resident myself
at this house 12 years ago,

18:38.784 --> 18:40.995
and I've been sober
ever since.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.956
I've sent other people here
and it's helped a lot of them...

18:44.957 --> 18:47.418
and it can work for Maddie
if she's willing to work it.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.630
Personally, I think the best
solution might be to take her
out of here.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.007
Then I'm afraid she's
going to be expelled.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.967
Well, then
I'll home school her.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.510
And she can go
to AA meetings at night.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.179
What makes you think
she'll follow through
with it?

18:58.179 --> 18:59.555
Because she
said she would.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.016
‐Of course she did.
‐What is your problem, Cynthia?

19:02.016 --> 19:03.851
Maddie is not your child.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.813
I'm aware of that,
but you did ask me
to watch out for her.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.775
And even though I have
a lot of experience
with addiction,

19:10.775 --> 19:13.361
Maddie managed
to hide her drinking
and using from both of us.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.614
She's smart
and manipulative,

19:16.614 --> 19:18.741
and who's to say
she can't fool us both again?

19:20.701 --> 19:22.161
Laurel: <i>Hello, Trish.</i>

19:22.161 --> 19:24.705
<i>You have a very fun</i>
<i>personality.</i>

19:25.748 --> 19:32.630
<i>But sometimes you can also</i>
<i>be a conniving, backstabbing...</i>

19:32.630 --> 19:34.256
<i>‐bitch.</i>
‐(gasps)

19:34.256 --> 19:38.052
<i>Well, maybe, you and I</i>
<i>should start a secret</i>
<i>alliance.</i>

19:38.052 --> 19:41.514
<i>But what if your boyfriend</i>
<i>Rick‐‐ I mean, Ron,</i>

19:41.514 --> 19:45.935
<i>with the muscles</i>
<i>and the tattoos finds out that</i>
<i>you're secretly working with me?</i>

19:45.935 --> 19:49.397
<i>Well, I will just tell him that</i>
<i>our secret alliance is fake.</i>

19:49.397 --> 19:51.649
<i>But it won't be,</i>
<i>it will be real.</i>

19:51.649 --> 19:54.443
Okay, can you add
like a sparkle thingy
when I wink?

19:54.443 --> 19:57.446
Yeah, I can add effects.
Maybe 3D titles.

19:57.446 --> 20:02.034
Color correction, I was thinking
maybe an L‐cut on the dialog
about Naked Guy.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.120
Mmm. Okay, um‐‐

20:04.120 --> 20:07.373
Is there any way you can
add some decent acting?

20:07.373 --> 20:09.375
Aw. I thought
you were pretty good.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.127
(clicks tongue)

20:11.127 --> 20:14.004
Kids drink.
Kids party,

20:14.004 --> 20:15.464
and most of the time
they grow out of it.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.842
If you think Maddie is fine,
then why did you call me
to begin with?

20:17.842 --> 20:20.428
(sighs) Why am I even
trying to have this
conversation with you?

20:20.428 --> 20:22.430
You don't even understand
what it's like to be
a parent.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.807
I have over 300 kids
at Parsons‐Bell.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.393
And you have the luxury of
turning that off every night.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.938
If I was a mother, I don't
think I would pull my child
away from the help she needs

20:30.938 --> 20:33.023
and take her home
with me just because
I was a little lonely.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.109
(scoffs)

20:36.986 --> 20:38.487
This conversation
is now over.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.333
(scoffs)
This is a drug den?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.334
I'd live here.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.336
Hey, Maddie. Do you think
you can do me a favor

20:54.336 --> 20:56.922
and, like, not talk
for the next several minutes?

20:56.922 --> 20:59.133
You think you can do that?
Thank you.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.972
I missed you so much.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.436
We don't ever need
to go back there again.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.295
(snorting)

21:36.295 --> 21:40.049
You know what? You're pretty
enough to be on that cover.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.470
I can be a model.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.807
You can be
my manager.

21:47.807 --> 21:48.933
(both laughing)

22:23.217 --> 22:24.260
Baby...

22:25.845 --> 22:27.221
Hi!

22:28.597 --> 22:29.932
What are you
doing here?

22:30.933 --> 22:31.934
You called me.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.311
Really?

22:37.982 --> 22:39.316
What is he
doing here?

22:39.316 --> 22:40.651
It's okay.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.611
Who the hell is she?

22:42.611 --> 22:43.779
‐It's nothing.
‐Look who's here.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.907
Hello, there, Wesley.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.952
I want both of
these two out.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.580
Harper, we are here
to try and help you.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.208
Been looking
for you, man.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.544
‐You owe me.
‐Yeah, I...

23:02.548 --> 23:03.841
Here's what I got.
All right?

23:11.932 --> 23:12.933
This ain't gonna
cover it.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.060
It's all I got.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.271
I'll get you the rest,
I promise. I just gotta‐

23:17.271 --> 23:18.647
Hey, I have some cash.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.484
Wait. Hey, hey, hey, no.
Hey, hey, here.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.156
That enough, hmm?

23:34.538 --> 23:35.664
Yeah, for now.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.750
Let's go.

23:44.632 --> 23:45.716
(whispering)

23:45.716 --> 23:46.759
(groans)

23:46.759 --> 23:48.218
(choking)

24:31.220 --> 24:33.973
(guys chattering)

25:00.082 --> 25:03.085
We'll help you, okay?
Just come with us.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.837
No, I don't want
to go anywhere.

25:04.837 --> 25:08.090
Can't you just‐‐
Can't you just stay
here with me?

25:08.090 --> 25:10.300
Okay, there's a bed
waiting for you
at the hospital.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.887
No! No hospitals, okay?

25:14.930 --> 25:16.265
Wes, can you
make him leave?

25:16.265 --> 25:18.809
We can do this.
Just the two of us.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.728
Just get in the car,
we can talk a little
more about it.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.604
‐(groans)
‐We can just check it out.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.149
‐You don't have to stay.
‐Craig: Hey, Harper...

25:25.149 --> 25:27.443
Okay, listen to me...

25:27.443 --> 25:30.863
They'll get you on meds.
You won't feel any of
the withdrawal symptoms.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.698
Baby...

25:34.324 --> 25:35.993
Remember when it was
just you and me?

25:38.829 --> 25:40.998
I miss you.
(chuckles)

25:42.166 --> 25:44.251
Come back to me.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.836
You know what?

25:45.836 --> 25:47.629
They'll get you
straightened out,

25:47.629 --> 25:50.883
and then you can decide
what you want to do.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.888
(chuckles) Okay.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.598
All right, everybody.

25:57.598 --> 26:00.642
Um, I just‐‐
I just have to pack
some stuff.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.437
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I don't think that's
a good idea.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.814
Um, Wes and I will
go and pack for you.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.733
Okay. Be back
in just a tick.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.156
Watch her.

26:22.623 --> 26:23.832
(clears throat)

26:25.292 --> 26:27.252
It's really good.
You're gonna get
some help.

26:28.754 --> 26:29.838
Aw!

26:31.340 --> 26:32.841
Are you his new me?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.430
Come on, you're using
the basement or the attic?

26:41.058 --> 26:43.769
Gosh, how messed up
are you?

26:43.769 --> 26:46.313
You know, he loves
a damsel in distress.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.314
He's here, isn't he?

26:47.314 --> 26:49.316
They made me call him.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.901
He owed them money.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.030
What?

26:55.030 --> 26:57.491
You tricked him into coming
here, so they could ambush him?

26:57.491 --> 26:59.243
Everybody has to pay
up eventually, right?

26:59.243 --> 27:01.578
You're disgusting.

27:01.578 --> 27:02.788
What do you know?

27:02.788 --> 27:04.498
I know he doesn't
deserve this.

27:04.498 --> 27:05.666
(scoffs)

27:05.666 --> 27:09.336
I know he happens to be
a good guy who is unlucky
enough to care about you.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.630
You got your money,
just leave him alone.

27:13.715 --> 27:14.925
Good idea.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.600
You know what, missy?

27:23.600 --> 27:27.312
One day, you're gonna
look at yourself in
the mirror,

27:27.312 --> 27:30.440
and you're gonna realize
that you're nothing.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.151
Okay? You're just
some girl just like

27:33.151 --> 27:35.320
every other
just some girl,

27:35.320 --> 27:37.823
and you're not special!

27:37.823 --> 27:39.241
And you don't matter!

27:41.785 --> 27:43.829
When you realize that, well,

27:43.829 --> 27:46.456
you just come find me.
We'll get high together.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.138
‐Where is she?
‐Uh...

28:03.140 --> 28:05.767
She‐‐ She left. I...

28:05.767 --> 28:07.895
(shouting) You couldn't
keep your eye on her
for one second?

28:09.438 --> 28:10.814
Hey‐‐ Wes!

28:12.900 --> 28:13.901
(sighs)

28:53.815 --> 28:55.817
My girlfriend's OD'ed.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.152
All right.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.364
(monitor flat lining)

29:11.333 --> 29:12.626
(coughing)

29:12.626 --> 29:13.794

29:19.341 --> 29:22.052
(cries)

29:37.317 --> 29:38.902
Charlotte: Excuse me.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.404
Can you tell me
where the glasses are?

29:40.404 --> 29:42.322
Ah! You want
some lemonade?

29:42.322 --> 29:44.157
I just made some.
On the counter.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.286
I'm making
Jamaican stew.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.330
The secret is
the white vinegar.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.832
Ah, smells great.

29:52.833 --> 29:53.834
Taste.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.672
Wow! That's fantastic.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.509
So you're new here?

30:02.509 --> 30:03.552
How long you got?

30:03.552 --> 30:07.264
Oh, no, I'm not‐‐
I'm Maddie's mom,
Charlotte.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.224
‐Ah!
‐It's nice to meet you.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.268
Are you the cook?

30:11.268 --> 30:15.939
(laughing) You think I would
be cooking in a crappy place
like this

30:15.939 --> 30:16.982
with stew tastes
like that?

30:16.982 --> 30:19.484
You want good
Jamaican food?

30:19.484 --> 30:22.320
You come to
my restaurant,
Margarita's.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.323
Oh! So you're
a patient here?

30:25.323 --> 30:27.826
Resident.
Court mandated.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.661
Cynthia:
There you are.

30:32.581 --> 30:36.501
Listen, I want to make
amends for what I said
about your parenting.

30:36.501 --> 30:37.544
That was way
out of line.

30:37.544 --> 30:38.920
I agree.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.131
The thing is,
there are no
teams here.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.716
We are both
on Maddie's
side, right?

30:42.716 --> 30:47.596
Well, I have to go with my gut
and do whatever I end up
deciding is best for my child.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.058
Charlotte,
I may not be a mom,

30:51.058 --> 30:54.436
but I do understand
what it's like being
an addict with a mom.

30:54.436 --> 30:57.647
Okay, okay, okay.
This is the testimonial
part of the video.

30:57.647 --> 31:00.609
So, Margarita,
I need you to tell them
how awesome I am

31:00.609 --> 31:02.319
and how everyone
in the house loves me!

31:02.319 --> 31:04.237
Okay? All right. Go.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.907
You know, you should
be on this <i>Fool House,</i>

31:06.907 --> 31:08.658
because you are
one big fool.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.827
I know, right?

31:10.827 --> 31:14.331
Why don't you stop all this
trying to be famous, when you
got nothing to be famous for?

31:14.331 --> 31:18.502
Hmm? And get your
life together and get
your daughter back.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.299
Stupid girl.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.136
Cut.

31:29.513 --> 31:31.098
Cut, cut, cut.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.047
What did that guy
whisper to you?

32:05.966 --> 32:08.009
Forget it.
Nothing important.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.555
Who was he?

32:16.476 --> 32:17.644
Nobody.

32:34.536 --> 32:36.496
<i>I had this teeny little</i>
<i>problem with meth‐‐</i>

32:36.496 --> 32:40.083
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to bring
some things in for Maddie.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.502
That's okay.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.090
I like that sweater.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.259
Sometimes I wish
her school had
uniforms.

32:49.259 --> 32:51.761
The money I spend
on clothes
for that girl.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.766
Ugh! She's always
been so messy.

32:56.766 --> 32:59.352
No wonder Maddie
doesn't know how
to clean the restroom.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.105
She has to clean
the bathroom?

33:02.105 --> 33:04.774
Yeah, and make up
her own bed,

33:04.774 --> 33:06.568
and do her
own laundry,

33:06.568 --> 33:09.112
and take a turn once
every two weeks and
cook dinner for everyone.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.656
I'm not really
looking forward
to that, though.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.241
Huh!

33:13.241 --> 33:15.327
I've never been able
to get Maddie to do
anything.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.997
(slow jazz music playing)

33:22.959 --> 33:25.670
(sighs) I'm worried
that she's going to pull
Maddie out of here.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.756
She doesn't listen.
No one takes direction.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.967
Powerless over people,
places and things.
Let it go, Cyn.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.302
Am I doing that thing?

33:32.302 --> 33:34.262
‐You're doing that thing.
‐Ugh!

33:34.262 --> 33:36.806
‐So I should just‐‐ (sighs)
‐Let it go.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.100
You're right.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.602
I'm going.

33:40.602 --> 33:43.939
Hopefully, Maddie's mom
will make the right decision.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.149
Practice your steps.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.193
Salsa steps
or "the" steps.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.527
Both.

33:51.905 --> 33:54.324
Have you ever been
on a 12‐step call?

33:54.324 --> 33:56.076
Sure. Lots of times.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.787
Are you worried
about Maddie?

33:58.787 --> 34:00.664
'Cause they're
pretty safe.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.457
We always go
with another person,

34:02.457 --> 34:05.210
and Craig wouldn't
let anything happen
to Maddie.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.088
He may seem like
a big goof,

34:08.088 --> 34:09.339
but he's a really
good guy.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.593
Thank you.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.053
You don't drink
perfume, do you?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.596
‐Huh?
‐Never mind.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.486
(sighs)

34:31.486 --> 34:34.531
She reached out for help.
That's a good sign.

34:43.832 --> 34:45.875
Do you think we can make
a stop on the way back?

34:47.794 --> 34:49.004
Sure.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.840
I do, I do.
Okay, look...

34:51.840 --> 34:55.302
the knife and the spoon
go right, so the fork left.

34:55.302 --> 34:56.553
‐Great, you know
what you win?
‐What?

34:56.553 --> 34:58.013
‐Another one.
‐Oh.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.889
(chuckles)
Nice work.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.975
‐Trish.
‐What? I'm setting the table.

35:01.975 --> 35:04.936
What is this reality show
mess really all about?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.229
What do you care?

35:06.229 --> 35:07.939
I'm asking, aren't I?

35:14.321 --> 35:16.656
If I get on <i>Fool House,</i>

35:16.656 --> 35:17.866
I'll be famous.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.911
And famous people don't
get their kids taken away
from them.

35:27.709 --> 35:28.960
I just want
my little girl back.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.590
You really want
your daughter back?

35:33.590 --> 35:35.550
Then you need to get
yourself a real job.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.927
Show everyone you got
your life together, you know.

35:37.927 --> 35:40.764
Well, how am I
supposed to do that?

35:40.764 --> 35:43.808
I can't even get hired
at Urban Sheik, and
their clothes suck.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.355
You can start waiting
tables at Margarita's.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.775
Really?

35:51.775 --> 35:54.319
Go set the table.
It won't set itself,
you know?

36:08.750 --> 36:10.001
