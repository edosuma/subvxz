NARRATOR: Previously
on "Heartland--"

00:04.963 --> 00:06.589
 Is it Val Stanton?

00:06.715 --> 00:08.800
I would be a stress case too
if I had to jump her horse.

00:08.925 --> 00:10.635
 There are a lot of
riders out there with way

00:10.760 --> 00:12.804
more experience
than you have that

00:12.929 --> 00:15.015
would leap at this opportunity.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.766
 You know, just
'cause things went

00:16.891 --> 00:18.893
south with you and Lou didn't
mean you had to quit your job.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.478
 It's time to move on.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.356
 Too bad.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.525
Jack really liked
having you around.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.652
 We wanted to
ask you something.

00:27.777 --> 00:30.196
 You see, Amy and I are putting
together a will right now.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.531
So we were hoping
that you two would

00:31.656 --> 00:34.617
agree to be Lyndy's guardians.

00:34.743 --> 00:35.910
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:36.036 --> 00:36.578
- Of course.
- Definitely.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.121
 Really?

00:38.246 --> 00:39.247
 We love her like she
was our own daughter.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.916
 Yeah.

00:42.042 --> 00:46.588
[music playing]

01:16.368 --> 01:17.202
 That looked great, Georgie.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.953
I wouldn't change a thing.

01:19.079 --> 01:19.954
 Thanks.

01:20.080 --> 01:20.955
 Hey.

01:21.081 --> 01:21.956
[lyndy babbling]

01:22.082 --> 01:23.124
 Hey.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.251
There's my little smiley pants.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.837
GEORGIE: Hi, Lyndy.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.673
 Yeah, actually, we
should probably wrap it up.

01:29.798 --> 01:30.965
Don't you have to
get to the clinic?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.342
 Yeah.

01:32.467 --> 01:32.759
I gotta leave in the
next few minutes.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.219
 OK.

01:34.344 --> 01:34.594
We should probably
call it a day, Georgie.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.720
 OK.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.263
Come on.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.640
 What do you think about
going to Maggie's tonight

01:38.765 --> 01:40.183
after work for some dinner?
- Yes.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.309
- Yeah?
- That would be awesome.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.435
- OK.
- OK.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.187
Have a good day.
- Thank you.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.480
- Bye.
- See you, Lyndy.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.399
 Bye!

01:47.524 --> 01:48.775
 Come on.

01:48.900 --> 01:49.818
Come on.
Get going.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.819
Come on.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.821
[mooing]

01:52.946 --> 01:53.822
Come on.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.161
 Hey.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.788
What's with these guys?

02:01.913 --> 02:03.248
- It's a bulldogging clinic.
- Yeah, I know.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.000
I put it together.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.376
I thought we were gonna off with
the dummy steer in the quad.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.377
 No.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.336
I like to get my
students started

02:08.461 --> 02:10.005
off with the real thing.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.589
 You mean our students seeing
as I am kinda the reason

02:11.715 --> 02:12.799
we have so many new kids out.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.300
 How do you figure?

02:14.426 --> 02:16.302
 They see me on the
circuit kicking butt.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.888
 I was doing fine
before you came along.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.515
 Man, you're in
some mood today.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.933
Casey out of town or something?

02:22.058 --> 02:25.353
 Yeah, as a matter of
fact, she is, Caleb.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.814
There was a death in her family.

02:27.939 --> 02:28.857
 Oh.

02:28.982 --> 02:29.816
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.234
I didn't know.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.820
Look, I just feel like
because I'm still at it,

02:33.945 --> 02:36.197
it's my duty to push you
to keep up with the latest

02:36.322 --> 02:37.157
training trends.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.075
 Hey, guys.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.535
Everything OK?
- Yep.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.078
 Yeah.

02:42.203 --> 02:45.290
 We're just talking about
how we're gonna kick this off.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.751
And we've decided
to start with steer.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.835
Real steer.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.211
 All right.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.254
I guess we're jumping
right in, guys.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.130
MAN 1: All right.
MAN 2: OK.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.465
Let's do it.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.177
 Bulldogging is all
about anticipation

02:57.302 --> 02:59.012
and using your
natural instincts.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.724
We're trying to figure out
which way that steer's gonna go.

03:02.849 --> 03:03.475
Let's find out.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.851
You wanna start us off?

03:04.976 --> 03:05.769
 Mm-hmm.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.728
 OK.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.188
Let's go.
MAN 1: All right.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.105
MAN 2: Let's go.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.023
Let's go.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.901
Let's do this thing.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.694
 So you're done already.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.488
I was hoping to catch
some of your practice.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.572
 Oh.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.698
It was just a short
session today.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.408
But we got a lot accomplished.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.910
 Hmm.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.080
Other priorities.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.500
I should remind you that the
show in Okotoks is next week.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.543
And there's gonna be a
lot of tough competition.

03:30.669 --> 03:31.753
 I think we're in good shape.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.130
 Well, I don't like
to take chances.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.758
So I've taken the
liberty of drawing

03:36.883 --> 03:38.843
up a schedule that'll take
us right through to the fall

03:38.968 --> 03:40.762
finale.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.013
Pink is training.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.057
Blue is competition.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.016
 Wow.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.059
That's a lot of pink.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.936
 And a lot of blue.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.231
 Well, I didn't say this
is gonna be a cakewalk.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.192
I guess if you're done for
the day, I'll just skedaddle.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.443
But I'll be back.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.950
 [sighs] Maybe we
should do a little more.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.118
 Yeah.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.202
I'll meet you out there.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.412
 OK.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.249
 OK, listen up.

04:09.374 --> 04:14.421
For those of you that have not
done this, Caleb is the hazer.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.423
The hazer's job is
to keep the steer

04:16.548 --> 04:19.341
running in a straight
line for the bulldogger--

04:19.466 --> 04:22.804
in this case, that's you,
Jade-- or the ribbon grabber.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.099
Girls have to get the ribbon
off the shoulder of the steer.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.143
The guys have to wrestle
the sucker to the ground.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.229
But the chase is still the same.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.605
You ready?

04:32.731 --> 04:33.398
OK.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.525
Let her rip.

04:35.650 --> 04:40.321

04:47.162 --> 04:48.663

04:48.788 --> 04:49.581
Atta girl, Jade.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.249
[cheering]

04:51.374 --> 04:52.208
 Come on.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.460
That was nothing.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.170
 That was pretty good.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.755
 My sister could
do it twice as fast.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.173
She never even been
in a rodeo before.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.007
 Your sister?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.091
 Yeah.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.843
Avery, get down here.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.094
 Wait a minute.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.095
 Come on.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.138
Show 'em what you can do.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.556
 [sighs]

05:06.681 --> 05:08.016
 Oh, don't make me
look like a liar now.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.362
Wait till you see this.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.620
[horses neighing]

05:39.839 --> 05:40.590
Yeah!
See?

05:40.715 --> 05:41.675
What'd I tell you.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.176
 Wow.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.302
That was really good.
- Good?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.512
That was amazing.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.139
Never seen a girl
do that before.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.099
MAN: That's right.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.642
 [laughs]
MAN: Yeah.

05:50.767 --> 05:51.726
Good job!

05:55.188 --> 05:59.067
[music - jenn grant, "dreamer"]

06:10.036 --> 06:17.210
 (SINGING) And at the break
of day, you sink into a dream,

06:17.335 --> 06:18.420
you dreamer.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.090
You dreamer.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.094

 Hi.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.231
 Hey.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.107
 I'm Avery.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.316
 I know.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.860
 You're Jade, right?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.319
 Yeah.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.697
 You had a really good run.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.489
What?

06:46.614 --> 06:48.033
You got the ribbon.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.785
 Yeah, like I was supposed
to instead of showing

06:50.910 --> 06:52.912
off in front of all the guys.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.039
 I was just--

06:54.164 --> 06:55.790
well, that's the way
my dad taught us.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.125
I can show you how if you want.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.043
 I'm OK.

06:58.168 --> 06:58.960
Thanks.

07:04.924 --> 07:05.842
 Oh, hey!

07:05.967 --> 07:06.926
There's our little princess.

07:07.052 --> 07:07.844
 Hey, guys.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.430
 Look at that pretty dress.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.973
How's our sunshine?

07:12.098 --> 07:12.974
 Hey.

07:13.099 --> 07:13.892
We're here too.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.310
BOTH: Hey, guys.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.520
 Look, I know since we
made you Lyndy's guardians,

07:17.645 --> 07:18.938
we're chopped liver.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.190
But you can join us
for dinner if you want.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.483
 Yeah.
Thanks.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.817
That'd be great.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.446
You know, guardian is so formal.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.198
I'm your godmama, right?

07:28.323 --> 07:30.158
 And that makes
me your godpapa.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.159
Yeah.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.327
[laughs] Scooch.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.411
 Yeah.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.039
You guys see her all day.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.207
 All right.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.958
 Hello, pretty girl.

07:39.084 --> 07:39.918
Hi.

07:40.043 --> 07:43.755
[lyndy cooing]

07:43.880 --> 07:44.839
 (WHISPERING) What's that?

07:54.432 --> 07:55.350
 Hey.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.351
 Hey.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.811
 Sorry.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.021
Hope this isn't, you
know, awkward, you know,

08:00.146 --> 08:01.981
being here with Adam.

08:02.107 --> 08:02.941
 No.
Not at all.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.234
 Good.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.612
Because this has nothing
to do with my boyfriend.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.988
Look, we need to
talk extreme team.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.156
 OK.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.366
 So Samantha's with
the older girls now.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.450
 Yeah, I heard.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.952
 You know what that means?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.037
 Look, I don't want a
huge rivalry for headliner

08:16.162 --> 08:16.746
like last year.

08:16.871 --> 08:17.997
 Neither do I. OK?

08:18.123 --> 08:19.791
That's why I was
thinking we could

08:19.916 --> 08:22.585
do it together as a tandem.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.213
Maybe the hippodrome
with a suicide drag?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.172
 Yeah.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.173
Yeah, that'd be cool.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.299
 OK.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.718
But we should practice it first.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.177
Do you think that Amy
could help us with that?

08:31.302 --> 08:32.011
 Yeah.
Yeah.

08:32.136 --> 08:32.804
I'll ask.
- Cool.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.639
So I'll swing by tomorrow?

08:34.764 --> 08:35.724
 I can't tomorrow.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.058
I have jumping practice.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.852
There's a huge show
at Okotoks coming up.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.562
 Well, there's a huge
rodeo coming up too.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.980
Look, we need to
get this trick down.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.398
Otherwise, Natalie's
just gonna choose

08:43.523 --> 08:45.025
someone else to be headliner.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.152
 OK.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.695
How's 9:00?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.405
 It's perfect.
I'll see you then.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.573
 Bye.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.703
 Ty sings to her?

08:56.828 --> 08:58.705
 He's actually not that bad.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.123
And then I read her
"Love You Forever."

09:00.248 --> 09:02.083
And she goes down
without an issue.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.668
 Wow.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.920
You're a little
angel, aren't you?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.214
 I have to say, we finally
have Lyndy's routine down.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.090
 Oh, that's so awesome.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.633
 Yeah.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.344
Every time we tell people
we're trying to have a baby,

09:12.469 --> 09:15.263
they say it'll flip
our lives upside down.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.306
 Don't listen to them.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.390
 It's incredible.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.142
 Oh, big yawns.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.436
It's time to put Lyndy
down for her bedtime.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.645
[laughs]

09:22.771 --> 09:23.730
 Well, this was fun.

09:23.855 --> 09:24.939
We should do it again sometime.

09:25.065 --> 09:25.774
 Yeah.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.858
Well, how about Saturday?

09:26.983 --> 09:27.984
 Yeah.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.069
We can come to you
guys at the loft.

09:29.194 --> 09:29.944
 With takeout.

09:30.070 --> 09:30.737
 Yeah.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.280
Sounds good.
- Yeah.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.281
Of course.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.199
 Cool.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.784
 But be honest.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.244
It's really her you
wanna see, right?

09:38.370 --> 09:39.371
[lyndy coos]

09:39.496 --> 09:40.372
 Yeah!

09:40.497 --> 09:41.373
[laughter]
- You know.

09:41.498 --> 09:42.290
 Say bye.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.249
 Bye.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.292
Bye, Lyndy.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.460
- Aw.
- They are so cute.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.461
 I know.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.629
 Yes.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.219
 Hey, great dismount!

09:54.344 --> 09:55.220
That's good, man.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.013
That's real good.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.598
You just gotta hook the horns
a little bit quicker next time.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.684
 Are you kidding me?

10:00.809 --> 10:03.436
Using this duct
tape contraption?

10:03.561 --> 10:05.522
It just creates bad habits.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.066
I got an exercise
that will show you

10:08.191 --> 10:09.401
how to do things the right way.
OK?

10:09.526 --> 10:10.276
Just come on.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.778
 No.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.988
I gotta get my
technique bang on.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.865
If this is how Caleb
learned, then I

10:15.990 --> 10:17.492
wanna do it this way too.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.827
I saw him bulldogging last week.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.203
He was lights out.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.996
 Well, all right.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.790
Avery, let's get you up next.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.333
Boys, pay attention.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.710
Her technique is flawless.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.628
Y'all need to be doing
exactly what she does.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.093
 Uh, what's going on here?

10:35.218 --> 10:36.136
 I texted you.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.095
 Sorry.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.346
I didn't get it.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.681
 Well, we were gonna
ask if you could help

10:39.806 --> 10:40.974
us with our new tandem trick.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.183
 Georgie, I thought
we were jumping.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.476
 I know.

10:43.601 --> 10:44.811
But we have a huge
rodeo coming up.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.312
And we could actually
be the headliners.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.564
Please?

10:47.689 --> 10:49.149
I know I have to
prep for the show.

10:49.274 --> 10:53.069
But trick riding's
important too.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.112
 OK, fine.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.113
 Thanks.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.417
 OK, but you guys need to
get into that trick faster.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.253
Bring it in, girls.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.588
OK, you know what?

11:11.713 --> 11:13.840
Olivia, how about you hop
off, and you watch me.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.342
I'm just gonna show you
the hippodrome part.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.186
You good?

11:26.311 --> 11:27.145
 Yeah.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.902
 OK.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.196
So you wanna be standing
up right about here.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.449
And that allows Georgie to
get into position quicker.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.494
Then you're gonna hold
it for about five seconds

11:42.619 --> 11:43.870
and then go back down slowly.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.372
And Georgie will get back up.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.006
OK.

11:55.131 --> 11:55.757
 OK.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.425
I think I get it.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.219
 Can we try that again?

11:59.344 --> 12:00.595
 Well, don't forget you still
have a full jumping practice

12:00.720 --> 12:02.055
ahead of you.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.933
 Actually, I kind
of need to get going.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.059
 See you tomorrow.

12:12.148 --> 12:12.941
 OK.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.110
How annoying was Caleb today?

12:15.235 --> 12:18.446
 Oh, the way he kept
pushing his ideas.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.864
 I guess.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.617
 Acting like he was
the big bulldogging

12:22.742 --> 12:24.619
champion with all the buckles.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.453
 Well, sort of.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.955
I mean--

12:27.080 --> 12:29.290
 I just don't see how
those kids can have

12:29.416 --> 12:32.544
stars in their eyes
for someone like Caleb,

12:32.669 --> 12:34.671
the king of mediocrity.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.547
 Oh, I don't know.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.464
I--

12:36.589 --> 12:37.424
 Yeah.

12:37.549 --> 12:38.758
He's undermining me.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.593
 I really didn't see
that, to be honest.

12:40.719 --> 12:43.513
I'm just talking about
how he kept putting Avery

12:43.638 --> 12:46.141
on a pedestal like she was God's
gift to the rodeo or something.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.434
 Listen.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.602
Well, you gotta admit
that girl can bulldog.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.981
 Yeah, well, so can I.
I mean, I think I can.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.900
But I need your help.

12:56.026 --> 12:59.154
I need lessons one on one.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.655
 Uh-huh.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.741
OK, on one condition.

13:02.866 --> 13:03.992
 Name it.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.495
 We do it the right way.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.624
My way.

13:11.750 --> 13:12.876
 All right.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.002
You're on.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.757
 Hey, Jack.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.300
Let me give you a hand.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.678
 Well, don't go getting
those fancy clothes dirty.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.764
So how's the big time job going?

13:25.889 --> 13:27.849
 Oh, it's, uh--

13:27.974 --> 13:30.352
I've been spending more time
in boardrooms than I thought.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.105
And the people I
work with are cool.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.690
It's pretty great so far.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.150
 That's good, you know?

13:37.275 --> 13:38.610
You're ever in the
neighborhood, you'll be

13:38.735 --> 13:39.694
more than welcome for dinner.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.529
 Oh, well, I--

13:41.654 --> 13:46.159
 Course, you'll have to put up
with my cooking what with Lou

13:46.284 --> 13:48.661
being in New York City.

13:48.787 --> 13:51.956
 Oh, she's still there, huh?

13:52.082 --> 13:55.168
Well, why don't we
say Saturday night?

13:55.293 --> 13:57.629
 Well, I'll set an extra place.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.546
 It's good to see you, Jack.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.298
 It's good to see you.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.174
 All right.

14:01.299 --> 14:01.966
I gotta go.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.134
Another boardroom.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.886
 Well, you knock 'em dead.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.645
 "A mother held her
new baby and very slowly

14:13.770 --> 14:19.401
rocked him back and forth, back
and forth, back and forth."

14:24.447 --> 14:25.198
There you go.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.076
[music - "rock-a-bye baby"]

14:28.201 --> 14:29.869
Goodnight, sweetheart.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.419
 I'm surprised you're still
reading from that book.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.753
You don't have it
memorized by now?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.839
 Well, she likes the pictures.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.634
And so do I. [laughs]

14:44.759 --> 14:45.719
 Isn't this amazing?

14:45.844 --> 14:46.636
 What?

14:46.761 --> 14:48.263
Our life?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.514
 Yeah.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.391
It's all coming together.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.767
We were so worried
about everything

14:52.892 --> 14:53.768
those first few months.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.020
 Oh, we were worried?

14:55.145 --> 14:56.187
I think you were worried.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.398
[laughter]

14:58.523 --> 14:59.441
 Yeah.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.234
Maybe I was a little.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.029
Look at her now, though.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.780
She's like a little angel.

15:05.905 --> 15:06.948
 Yeah, she is.

15:09.534 --> 15:13.079
I love you so much.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.205
 (WHISPERING) Love you too.

15:18.126 --> 15:22.130
[crickets chirping]

15:23.673 --> 15:27.135
[lyndy crying]

15:27.761 --> 15:28.553
 Shh.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.512
You're OK.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.472
It's OK, sweetheart.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.806
Uh oh.

15:31.931 --> 15:32.891
Oh, 39.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.392
Ty, she's got a fever.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.935
[shushing]

15:36.061 --> 15:37.145
 It says it can be dangerous
for babies under six months.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.229
 She's over six months.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.689
 Yeah, but just, Amy.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.149
 It's OK.
Shh.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.067
 It could be dehydration.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.443
Has she had enough fluids?

15:43.568 --> 15:45.111
 I think so.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.321
 Does she have
sunken fontanels?

15:46.446 --> 15:47.197
 What?

15:47.322 --> 15:48.406
 The soft spots on her head.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.491
 I can't tell, Ty.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.785
I don't know.

15:51.910 --> 15:52.660
 Oh, my god.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.204
 What?

15:54.329 --> 15:55.747
 This says that a fever
can lead to seizures.

15:55.872 --> 15:56.831
 Ty, no.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.041
We have to go to the hospital.

15:58.166 --> 15:58.792
Let's get her checked out.
- Yeah.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.543
Let's go.
- OK.

16:00.669 --> 16:01.628
You're OK.

16:01.753 --> 16:02.921
Can you get the diaper bag?
- Yep.

16:03.046 --> 16:03.922
Got it right here.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.131
 And the truck keys.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.633
Are they--
- They're in the truck.

16:06.758 --> 16:07.592
Yep.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.601
 Well, I got her to
sleep in her car seat.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.769
[laughs]

16:17.894 --> 16:19.479
 Thanks, grandpa.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.856
 And you can leave her with
me for another couple hours

16:21.981 --> 16:23.149
if you'd like.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.360
You both had a long
night in the ER.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.779
 Jack.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.114
Were you two at the hospital?

16:29.239 --> 16:31.199
 Yeah, with Lyndy.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.617
 Is everything OK?

16:32.742 --> 16:33.952
 She had a fever, so
we had her checked out.

16:34.077 --> 16:34.953
 And?

16:35.078 --> 16:36.204
 Well, she's teething.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.209
 They don't have
a teething app?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.211
 Oh, dad, come on.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.254
We panicked a little.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.588
But she was beside herself.

16:45.714 --> 16:47.173
 We've never seen
her like that before.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.800
 So Lyndy's with
me this morning.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.052
You'll have to check
those fences on your own.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.721
 Uh, I can't.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.305
I'm busy with the rodeo school.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.307
 We're rounding up calves
in a couple of days.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.476
We need to make sure
those fences are good.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.562
 Jack, do you know how
crazy it is at the school

17:00.687 --> 17:01.271
this time of year?

17:01.396 --> 17:02.647
 You've got Caleb.

17:02.772 --> 17:03.565
 I have Caleb.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.733
Exactly.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.527
I'll see what I can do.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.695
No promises.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.239
 Gee, thanks, partner.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.535
[sighs]

17:15.660 --> 17:17.287
 I should probably get
out there and help Georgie.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.080
She's been in the jumping
ring for a while now.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.000
 Jack, you deal
with the fences, OK?

17:22.125 --> 17:23.417
I got lots of paperwork to do.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.752
I can bring Lyndy in the
office so she can nap

17:24.877 --> 17:25.920
there while I plow through it.

17:26.046 --> 17:26.921
 Thanks.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.006
- You sure?
- Yeah.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.174
We'll be fine.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.305
Thanks.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.473
 Are you sure about this?

17:36.598 --> 17:37.307
Shouldn't we start
with the dummy?

17:37.432 --> 17:38.099
 No.

17:38.224 --> 17:38.975
No, that's Caleb's way.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.602
OK?

17:40.727 --> 17:43.396
If you wanna wrestle a
steer, you wrestle a steer.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.564
OK.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.232
Now, what you wanna
do is you just

17:46.358 --> 17:48.610
wanna hook your right
arm underneath this horn

17:48.735 --> 17:52.072
and push down with your
left here like that.

17:52.197 --> 17:53.031
You try that.

17:53.156 --> 17:53.907
Step down.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.576
 All right.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.036
 Hook that.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.371
That's it.
- Like this?

17:59.496 --> 18:00.538
 Get a good firm grip, yeah.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.790
Only strong.
You wanna be strong.

18:01.915 --> 18:02.749
All right?

18:02.874 --> 18:03.958
How's that feel?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.043
- [sighs] OK.
- Feel good?

18:05.168 --> 18:06.086
OK.
- OK.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.337
 Good.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.798
Now, you just--
now, away he goes.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.049
 OK.
What do I do now?

18:11.174 --> 18:12.050
 That's it.
That's it.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.051
Good.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.094
You just kind of have to--

18:14.219 --> 18:15.220
yeah.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.638
You wanna hook his nose there.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.555
That's--

18:17.681 --> 18:19.307
[grunting]

18:19.432 --> 18:20.225
Keep your balance.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.060
Stay with him.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.061
That was--

18:23.186 --> 18:24.270
 [grunts]

18:24.396 --> 18:25.063
 Oh.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.064
Well.
OK.

18:26.189 --> 18:26.981
Here.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.525
Come on.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.276
[grunts] OK.

18:30.402 --> 18:31.361
I think this is
gonna take a little

18:31.486 --> 18:32.529
more work than I thought.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.239
 I'm not ready
for a real steer.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.241
Can we use something else?

18:36.366 --> 18:39.452
 Do you think Avery
gave up that easy?

18:39.577 --> 18:40.161
 Fine.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.454
Let's go again.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.455
 OK.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.960
 I think we're ready
to do this at a lope.

18:47.085 --> 18:47.919
 I don't know, Georgie.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.129
Your timing is still off.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.088
 But it's harder at a trot.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.965
Let's just give it a try.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.009
 [sighs] What do
you think, Olivia?

18:54.134 --> 18:56.428
 I'm all good.

18:56.553 --> 18:57.804
 OK, fine.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.557
But if anything feels off,
don't do the drag, OK?

19:00.682 --> 19:01.725
 OK.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.768
 [sighs] OK.

19:03.893 --> 19:07.772
[clicking tongue]

19:15.238 --> 19:16.865
[grunting]

19:16.990 --> 19:18.199
 What's wrong?

19:18.324 --> 19:21.536
OK, Georgie, pull up.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.039
Olivia, stop.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.040
You OK?

19:25.165 --> 19:26.875
[groaning]

19:27.000 --> 19:27.792
What happened, Georgie?

19:27.917 --> 19:28.710
Hey, it's OK.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.794
 Let go.

19:29.919 --> 19:34.716
[groaning] Ow.

19:34.841 --> 19:35.508
 One more time.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.468
 You keep saying that.

19:36.593 --> 19:37.802
 Well, you almost got it.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.012
 You keep saying that too.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.013
 Well, I mean at this time.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.181
OK?

19:41.306 --> 19:43.183
This part you gotta get down.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.392
It's most important.
- What?

19:44.517 --> 19:45.518
Getting dragged like a rag doll?

19:45.643 --> 19:46.728
 No.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.440
You gotta learn to
control the slide.

19:50.565 --> 19:54.527
Look, it's all about form,
not brute strength, OK?

19:54.652 --> 19:56.154
You need the leverage.

19:56.279 --> 19:57.405
 OK.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.990
But this is the last time.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.409
 OK.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.411
It's like a dance.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.123
It's like a dance with
a 350 pound partner.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.625
- OK.
- OK.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.542
Here we go.

20:09.668 --> 20:10.460
 OK.

20:10.585 --> 20:11.211
OK.

20:11.336 --> 20:12.087
 Nice.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.090
[mooing]

20:15.215 --> 20:16.091
That's it.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.008
His nose.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.677
[grunting]

20:18.802 --> 20:21.304
Now turn him, and
then hook his nose.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.056
Fall back.
That's it!

20:23.181 --> 20:23.932
You did it.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.183
[laughs] Yeah!

20:25.308 --> 20:26.184
 I did it!

20:26.309 --> 20:28.186
I actually did it!

20:28.311 --> 20:29.437
 There you go.
See?

20:29.562 --> 20:30.689
I told you.
Piece of cake.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.116
 Aw.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.535
[laughs] What an adorable pair.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.411
 Yeah.

20:44.536 --> 20:46.329
She's something, isn't she?

20:46.454 --> 20:50.000
 You're a lucky girl to have
such a great great grandpa.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.461
 You don't have to
remind me of how old I am.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.630
 Doesn't like to be
teased either, does he?

20:55.755 --> 20:58.133
No, he doesn't.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.926
So where are Amy and Georgie?

21:00.051 --> 21:01.386
They're supposed to
be schooling Flame.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.138
 In town at the hospital.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.180
 What?

21:04.305 --> 21:05.640
 Training mishap.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.766
 You're kidding.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.269
 Things happen, Val.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.645
There they are right there.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.701
 What happened?

21:24.826 --> 21:26.494
Are you OK?

21:26.619 --> 21:27.454
 Yeah.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.289
I'm a little sore, but I'm fine.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.082
I just pulled a muscle.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.751
 Thank God.

21:32.876 --> 21:33.793
What about Flame?

21:33.918 --> 21:34.502
 Oh, he's OK.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.962
She wasn't riding him.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.047
 Oh.

21:37.172 --> 21:38.798
Well, good.

21:38.923 --> 21:39.549
Wait a minute.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.092
Who were you riding?

21:41.217 --> 21:42.010
 Checkers.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.011
 Who?

21:43.136 --> 21:44.929
 Her trick riding horse.

21:45.055 --> 21:47.265
 Trick riding.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.476
 I have a huge rodeo coming up.

21:49.601 --> 21:52.687
 I don't care about
some two bit rodeo.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.023
You're supposed to be training
for the show in Okotoks.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.691
 Well, the plan was
to be ready for both.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.361
But now I can't
ride for a few days.

21:59.486 --> 22:04.824
 [sighs] [laughs] And how are
you gonna be ready in time?

22:04.949 --> 22:05.825
OK.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.118
This will never happen again.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.578
 It's trick riding.

22:08.703 --> 22:10.038
I can't promise I won't
get a little dinged up.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.122
 Right.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.332
Of course you can't.

22:12.457 --> 22:13.875
And that's why
you're gonna quit.

22:14.000 --> 22:14.959
 Quit?

22:15.085 --> 22:17.879
 I have big plans
for that horse.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.799
He could even go as far
as the Olympics someday.

22:20.924 --> 22:24.010
Do you want to be a part of
that or some sideshow doing

22:24.135 --> 22:25.387
tricks in hot pink Spandex?

22:27.555 --> 22:28.556
Your choice.

22:46.074 --> 22:48.493
 I just can't stop
thinking about it.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.911
I was so tired.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.371
Maybe I wasn't watching
her closely enough.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.373
 Amy, Amy, Amy.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.624
It was a minor injury.

22:54.749 --> 22:55.417
OK?

22:55.542 --> 22:56.918
Don't beat yourself up.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.253
 Yeah.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.256
Get all your work done?

23:01.381 --> 23:03.133
 Not even close.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.385
 [sighs] You know, if you want,
Ty, you go down in the office.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.429
I can stay up here with her.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.847
 No, it's OK.

23:08.972 --> 23:11.391
I'm gonna be done for today.

23:11.516 --> 23:13.518
I feel like making
a bag of popcorn

23:13.643 --> 23:16.062
and just heading
to bed real early.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.773
 [laughs] That
sounds like my speed.

23:18.898 --> 23:19.733
 Yeah?

23:19.858 --> 23:21.109
Well, good.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.027
 [sighs]

23:22.152 --> 23:24.404
 [groans]

23:24.529 --> 23:25.363
 Hey, guys.

23:25.488 --> 23:26.948
Dinner is served.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.952
[lyndy crying]

23:32.746 --> 23:35.123
You guys look bagged.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.249
 Well--

23:36.374 --> 23:37.125
 What?

23:37.250 --> 23:38.585
They do.

23:38.710 --> 23:39.878
 Lyndy hasn't really
been herself lately.

23:40.003 --> 23:40.712
So--

23:40.837 --> 23:42.213
 She's teething right now.

23:42.339 --> 23:43.131
 Aw.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.632
Poor girl.

23:44.758 --> 23:46.634
But she seems OK now.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.054
Must be because her
godmama is here, right?

23:49.179 --> 23:49.971
Yeah.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.306
[lyndy crying]

23:51.431 --> 23:52.265
Oh, no.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.224
What did I do, Amy?

23:53.350 --> 23:54.809
I'm so sorry.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.102
 It's OK, Lyndy.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.312
Hey.
Hey.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.313
She just needs her mom.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.647
You're OK, sweetheart.

23:59.773 --> 24:00.648
I know.

24:00.774 --> 24:01.483
I know.

24:01.608 --> 24:02.359
Come to mommy.
OK.

24:02.484 --> 24:03.943
 Yeah.
She'll be fine.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.070
Let's dig in, guys.

24:05.195 --> 24:05.945
This looks great.

24:06.071 --> 24:08.031
 [shushing] It's OK.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.991
Yeah, there you go.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.994
So Caleb, how's
working with my dad?

24:13.119 --> 24:14.371
 It's been really great.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.290
I think he really likes
what I bring to the table.

24:17.415 --> 24:19.292
 He's driving me nuts.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.044
 And the kids, they love me.

24:21.169 --> 24:23.296
 He's throwing
everyone off their game.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.799
 Just today, I jotted down
some big picture ideas.

24:28.551 --> 24:30.261
 I can't even read that.

24:30.387 --> 24:32.681
 And if things keep
going the way they are,

24:32.806 --> 24:34.766
he's gonna bump me up.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.768
 I know what I gotta do.

24:36.893 --> 24:38.728
 He's gonna make
me an equal partner.

24:38.853 --> 24:39.979
 I gotta fire him.

24:42.691 --> 24:43.441
[lyndy crying]
- Shh.

24:43.566 --> 24:44.359
You're OK.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.610
You're OK.

24:45.735 --> 24:46.486
 Do you want me
to take her, Amy?

24:46.611 --> 24:48.029
 Yeah.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.115
Thanks.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.116
 It's OK.

24:54.577 --> 24:55.453
Yeah.

24:55.578 --> 24:56.538
What do I do?

24:56.663 --> 24:57.831
 Just, um, bounce her a little.

24:57.956 --> 24:58.623
 OK.

24:58.748 --> 24:59.874
See what does.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.001
Yeah.

25:01.126 --> 25:03.878
[gasps]

25:04.004 --> 25:05.714
AMY: Oh, I'll get a towel.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.340
 Here, Cassie.
I'll take care her.

25:07.465 --> 25:08.633
Here.

25:08.758 --> 25:09.718
 Well, at least
she stopped crying.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.726
 It's nice you could
come eat with us.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.102
We've hardly seen you.

25:19.227 --> 25:20.520
 Yeah.
I know.

25:20.645 --> 25:21.730
It's just-- it's been this job.

25:21.855 --> 25:25.942
It's been so much fun.

25:26.067 --> 25:28.069
I get to use my
engineering background

25:28.194 --> 25:36.244
to consult with project managers
and CEOs, CFOs, and COOs, and--

25:38.913 --> 25:40.373
this is really boring,
isn't it, guys?

25:40.498 --> 25:41.207
 No.
No.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.250
No.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.585
It's really interesting.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.005
 [laughs] You're not
that good a liar, kid.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.048
[knocking]

25:48.173 --> 25:49.049
 Oh.

25:49.174 --> 25:50.008
I'll get it.

25:56.681 --> 25:58.183
 Hey.

25:58.308 --> 25:59.225
Is Olivia here?

25:59.351 --> 26:01.436
 [sighs] No.

26:01.561 --> 26:02.937
I heard what happened.

26:03.063 --> 26:03.688
 Yeah.

26:03.813 --> 26:04.689
Everything's fine.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.691
It's just Val.

26:06.816 --> 26:07.776
 What do you mean?

26:07.901 --> 26:11.488
 [sighs] She's just really mad.

26:11.613 --> 26:14.574
She wants me to
quit extreme team.

26:14.699 --> 26:16.117
 That's not up to her.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.494
 Yeah, I know.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.538
But if I don't, then I
can't ride Flame anymore.

26:20.663 --> 26:22.832
 Well, that's stupid.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.210
Good luck trying to find
someone as good as you.

26:25.335 --> 26:27.128
 Thanks.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.423
[sighs]

26:30.548 --> 26:32.050
 What?

26:32.175 --> 26:33.551
 Nothing.

26:33.677 --> 26:38.723
It's just-- you're different
when Olivia's not around.

26:38.848 --> 26:41.142
 You are too.

26:41.267 --> 26:41.935
 Yeah.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.144
It's all a little bit--

26:43.269 --> 26:44.020
 Awkward.

26:44.145 --> 26:45.146
 Yeah.
Yeah.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.481
 [laughs]

26:46.606 --> 26:47.899
 Yeah.

26:48.024 --> 26:49.651
Let's try not to be
that way anymore.

26:52.862 --> 26:57.283
So what's new with
you besides Olivia?

26:57.409 --> 26:59.661
 You should see this
new kid I'm tutoring.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.329
Talk about a handful.

27:01.454 --> 27:02.664
 As bad as I was?

27:02.789 --> 27:05.208
 Hey, nobody could be that bad.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.628
[laughter]

27:08.753 --> 27:11.089
[music - "rock-a-bye baby"]

27:11.214 --> 27:14.926
 I am so sorry about
dinner and about your shirt.

27:15.051 --> 27:16.469
 It's OK.

27:16.594 --> 27:17.762
I'm sure it'll come out.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.932
I just feel so bad for Lyndy.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.684
 That is the hardest
part about being a parent

27:22.809 --> 27:23.643
is seeing your child so upset.

27:23.768 --> 27:24.769
 Yeah.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.521
We were feeling so dialed in.

27:26.646 --> 27:27.689
Everything was going smoothly.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.482
And then bam.

27:29.607 --> 27:30.775
This.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.027
 Well, at least
it's just teething.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.903
I mean, how long can
it possibly last?

27:34.029 --> 27:34.946
 Couple of weeks.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.365
 Or months, the doctor said.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.450
 Months?

27:38.575 --> 27:39.534
 The way she was tonight?

27:39.659 --> 27:41.536
 Well, hopefully not.

27:41.661 --> 27:42.412
We'll see, though.

27:42.537 --> 27:44.205
You know?

27:44.330 --> 27:46.041
 Well, we should
probably get going,

27:46.166 --> 27:47.584
let you guys get some rest.
- Yeah.

27:47.709 --> 27:48.460
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.086
Thanks for dinner.

27:50.211 --> 27:51.588
 No, thank you,
guys, for bringing it.

27:51.713 --> 27:52.839
 Yeah.
Thank you.

27:52.964 --> 27:54.549
- I'm sorry again.
- No, it's OK.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.051
- We'll do this again.
- Yeah.

27:56.176 --> 27:56.968
 See you guys.

27:57.093 --> 27:58.636
 See you.

27:58.762 --> 28:02.724
 [sighs]

28:06.019 --> 28:11.691
 [groans] We haven't
even eaten yet.

28:11.816 --> 28:14.402
 Who cares?

28:14.527 --> 28:15.612
[sighs]

28:15.737 --> 28:17.405
 [groans]

28:17.530 --> 28:19.532
 Thanks.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.409
You're not kidding about
it being quiet around here.

28:21.534 --> 28:22.410
 Yeah.

28:22.535 --> 28:23.787
I know.

28:23.912 --> 28:26.623
For years, I complained
about the chaos.

28:26.748 --> 28:29.042
Now, well, I kinda miss it.

28:29.167 --> 28:29.793
 Yeah.

28:29.918 --> 28:31.127
I get that.

28:31.252 --> 28:32.712
 But the ranch
keeps me busy enough.

28:32.837 --> 28:37.634
I was hoping Tim would've
picked up the slack after you--

28:37.759 --> 28:39.386
well, when you left.

28:39.511 --> 28:40.595
 Oh.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.596
So that hasn't happened then?

28:41.721 --> 28:44.724
 Not even close.

28:44.849 --> 28:47.560
Just this morning,
he bailed on me.

28:47.686 --> 28:50.355
I'm trying to set up a day
to vaccinate the calves.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.273
And-- nah.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.402
He won't show.

28:55.527 --> 28:57.570
 Why don't I take his place?

28:57.696 --> 28:59.155
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.699
I think I still
remember what I'm doing.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.367
 Well, that would be great.

29:02.492 --> 29:03.451
You're serious?

29:03.576 --> 29:05.120
 It's not free labor.

29:05.245 --> 29:07.539
I expect a six pack out of it.

29:07.664 --> 29:08.456
 You're on.

29:19.551 --> 29:20.802
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:20.927 --> 29:21.720
 How you feeling?

29:21.845 --> 29:23.513
 Pretty stiff.

29:23.638 --> 29:26.391
I slept well though until I woke
up at 5:00 AM with Val's voice

29:26.516 --> 29:27.934
in my head.

29:28.059 --> 29:29.853
Who does she think
she is trying to tell

29:29.978 --> 29:32.105
me what I can and can't do?

29:32.230 --> 29:32.814
 Yeah.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.357
I get why you're mad.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.985
But I have to say Val
kinda has a point.

29:37.110 --> 29:37.777
 What?

29:37.902 --> 29:39.029
You're on her side?

29:39.154 --> 29:40.697
 I'm not siding
with anyone, Georgie.

29:40.822 --> 29:44.200
I'm just saying that I can
see where she's coming from.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.244
You know, she has high
hopes for that horse.

29:46.369 --> 29:48.371
And she needs a rider
who's willing to go all in.

29:48.496 --> 29:49.789
 Well, I don't wanna
quit trick riding.

29:49.914 --> 29:51.166
 Then don't.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.751
 But I wanna keep
jumping Flame too.

29:52.876 --> 29:54.294
 I see how tough this is.

29:54.419 --> 29:56.379
You're doing great
at two things.

29:56.504 --> 29:58.590
But you can't keep them
both up at this level.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.342
You're gonna have to pick one.

30:00.467 --> 30:03.428
 Well, you never had to
choose one equestrian sport.

30:03.553 --> 30:05.472
 No, I didn't.

30:05.597 --> 30:07.015
But I also never
had the opportunity

30:07.140 --> 30:08.141
to go to the Olympics.

30:13.480 --> 30:17.025
 [sighs]

30:45.762 --> 30:46.554
 Everybody's ready.

30:48.515 --> 30:49.349
 Yeah.

30:49.474 --> 30:50.642
Uh, listen.

30:50.767 --> 30:53.520
There's something I
wanna talk to you about.

30:53.645 --> 30:55.188
It seems that--

30:55.313 --> 30:55.897
 All right.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.440
Can we do this?

30:57.565 --> 30:59.818
Let's throw ourselves
on some steers, boys.

30:59.943 --> 31:01.820
 [laughs]

31:01.945 --> 31:02.862
 Well, look.

31:02.987 --> 31:04.030
We'll talk later, OK?

31:04.155 --> 31:05.615
 OK.

31:05.740 --> 31:07.992
 I'm glad you're ready to
put your training to use.

31:08.118 --> 31:09.327
But today, I'm gonna
give you a little demo,

31:09.452 --> 31:10.453
show you how it's
done at full speed.

31:10.578 --> 31:11.538
 No.
No.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.707
That won't be necessary.

31:13.832 --> 31:14.749
 You don't think
it's a good idea

31:14.874 --> 31:15.875
for them to see a professional?

31:16.001 --> 31:16.835
 No, I agree.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.044
It would.

31:18.169 --> 31:20.422
That's why I'm
gonna do the demo.

31:20.547 --> 31:23.466
 I don't know if
that's a good idea.

31:23.591 --> 31:26.302
 You ever won a
buckle at the stampede?

31:26.428 --> 31:27.220
 No.

31:27.345 --> 31:28.221
 Button it.

31:38.982 --> 31:42.444
[horses neighing]

31:55.457 --> 31:57.751
 [grunts]

31:57.876 --> 31:59.377
 Good job, Tim.

31:59.502 --> 32:02.464
[cheering]

32:04.507 --> 32:06.343
[groaning]

32:06.468 --> 32:08.094
 Oh, my god.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.722
Tim!

32:10.847 --> 32:14.351
 [groans]

32:14.476 --> 32:15.310
 Are you OK?

32:15.435 --> 32:16.269
 [sighs] Yeah.

32:16.394 --> 32:17.062
Yeah.

32:17.187 --> 32:18.438
I just rang my bell a bit.

32:18.563 --> 32:20.065
 OK.

32:20.190 --> 32:21.107
 Crazy old man.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.567
 Hey!
[laughter]

32:22.692 --> 32:23.902
 That's not funny.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.570
Tim Fleming is a living legend.

32:25.695 --> 32:28.406
He just did a perfect run.

32:28.531 --> 32:31.409
I get that you weren't born
when Tim was in his prime.

32:31.534 --> 32:33.244
But I grew up with
this poster on my wall

32:33.370 --> 32:34.829
because he's the best.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.040
That's who you have as a coach.

32:37.165 --> 32:40.168
Don't take it for granted.

32:40.293 --> 32:42.629
 Oh, I'm touched, Caleb.

32:42.754 --> 32:45.173
You know, I had a Farrah
Fawcett poster on my wall.

32:45.298 --> 32:48.635
But whatever
polishes your buckle.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.512
OK, who's next?

32:50.637 --> 32:52.097
 I'll go.

32:52.222 --> 32:54.015
No ribbon necessary.

32:57.811 --> 32:58.853
[horse neighing]

32:58.978 --> 32:59.771
 Hyah!

32:59.896 --> 33:00.689
Come one!

33:00.814 --> 33:04.984
[mooing]

33:05.110 --> 33:05.860
 That's it.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.362
Stay in control, Jade.

33:09.823 --> 33:10.615
Hook the horn!

33:10.740 --> 33:13.952
Turn his head!

33:14.077 --> 33:15.995
That's it!

33:16.121 --> 33:16.955
That's it, Jade.
Atta girl.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.039
Good ride.

33:21.209 --> 33:22.711
 Nice run.

33:22.836 --> 33:23.795
 Hey.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.713
That was great.

33:24.838 --> 33:25.630
Good job.

33:25.755 --> 33:26.673
 Thanks.

33:26.798 --> 33:27.632
 Yeah, Jade.

33:27.757 --> 33:28.591
That was awesome.

33:28.717 --> 33:29.634
 OK, look.

33:29.759 --> 33:31.011
I know it wasn't
as good as yours.

33:31.136 --> 33:33.346
 Hey, it was your first try.

33:33.471 --> 33:36.224
 So what you're saying is it
was awesome for a beginner.

33:36.349 --> 33:38.393
 No, I didn't say that.

33:38.518 --> 33:40.729
I do think you tried
to manhandle the steer.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.188
Agility and woman's intuition.

33:42.313 --> 33:43.064
That's what we have.

33:43.189 --> 33:44.190
Go with that.

33:44.315 --> 33:45.734
Don't try to do it like a guy.

33:45.859 --> 33:48.945
 Thanks for the advice that
I really didn't ask for.

33:49.070 --> 33:52.323
 You know, I was really
excited when I heard about you.

33:52.449 --> 33:54.701
A girl who's a
kickass bronc rider.

33:54.826 --> 33:57.537
You're the reason why I let
my brother drag me up here.

33:57.662 --> 33:58.913
I thought you'd have
too much confidence

33:59.039 --> 33:59.873
to see me as a threat.

33:59.998 --> 34:02.167
But I was wrong.

34:02.292 --> 34:03.084
Don't worry.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.795
I won't be back.

34:05.920 --> 34:06.713
Oh, and your feet?

34:06.838 --> 34:08.130
They got behind you.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.091
Push down the inside of
the horn will fix that.

34:21.478 --> 34:22.270
 Hey.

34:22.395 --> 34:23.021
 Hey.

34:23.146 --> 34:24.397
 Hey.

34:24.522 --> 34:26.775
 Oh, look who found her smile.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.902
 [laughs] Yeah, she's
back to herself now.

34:30.027 --> 34:32.530
 I'm really sorry about
the gong show last night.

34:32.655 --> 34:33.531
 Stop apologizing.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.116
It's fine.

34:35.241 --> 34:36.784
 Well, at least you've seen
the dark side of parenthood now.

34:36.909 --> 34:37.869
It's not too late to opt out.

34:37.994 --> 34:39.661
 Oh, whatever.

34:39.788 --> 34:41.623
Caleb and Cass aren't gonna let
one bad night scare them off.

34:41.748 --> 34:43.083
 [laughs] No.

34:43.208 --> 34:43.958
No, no, no.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.502
Of course not.

34:45.627 --> 34:49.339
I mean, this has nothing
to do with last night.

34:49.464 --> 34:52.092
But we had a chat
when we got home.

34:52.217 --> 34:55.929
And you know, Caleb being
at the rodeo school and me

34:56.054 --> 35:01.685
at the clinic and the new puppy
and being godparents and--

35:01.810 --> 35:04.104
you know, we're
practically newlyweds.

35:04.229 --> 35:07.232
We decided we're
just-- we're gonna

35:07.357 --> 35:08.942
hold off for a little bit.

35:09.067 --> 35:09.984
- Oh.
- Oh.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.486
Well, that's-- that's OK.

35:11.611 --> 35:12.654
 Yeah.

35:12.779 --> 35:13.905
 Hey.

35:14.030 --> 35:14.906
I'm ready.

35:15.031 --> 35:16.074
Let's go talk to Val.

35:16.199 --> 35:17.158
 OK.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.285
 I'll talk to you guys later.

35:19.411 --> 35:21.413
Bye-bye, my little munchkin.

35:21.538 --> 35:22.372
Bye.

35:22.497 --> 35:23.331
Bye.

35:31.798 --> 35:33.049
 Hello.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.175
 Hi, Val.

35:36.970 --> 35:38.471
 I'm glad you called.

35:38.596 --> 35:40.974
Thank you for coming to
a decision so quickly.

35:41.099 --> 35:43.351
 It didn't feel quick to me.

35:43.476 --> 35:44.853
It's been on my
mind ever since you

35:44.978 --> 35:46.813
said I had to make the choice.

35:46.938 --> 35:49.315
 Val, you have to
realize that Georgie's

35:49.441 --> 35:51.526
given this a lot of thought.

35:51.651 --> 35:53.278
You're asking her to choose
between the two things

35:53.403 --> 35:54.863
she loves to do the most.

35:54.988 --> 35:56.031
 Yes.

35:56.156 --> 35:57.699
Well, I completely understand.

35:57.824 --> 35:58.950
But--

35:59.075 --> 36:00.201
 It's OK.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.495
I get it.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.415
[sighs] I hate to
have to do this.

36:05.540 --> 36:06.750
It's really hard.

36:06.875 --> 36:14.674
But I've decided to
quit extreme team.

36:14.799 --> 36:18.178
 Georgie, I do
realize how difficult

36:18.303 --> 36:19.888
this has been for you.

36:20.013 --> 36:23.516
But I am very pleased.

36:23.641 --> 36:25.226
 I wanna keep jumping Flame.

36:25.352 --> 36:28.188
And we'll be ready for Okotoks.

36:28.313 --> 36:29.356
I want us to go all the way.

36:29.481 --> 36:30.732
I want to go to the Olympics.

36:30.857 --> 36:33.485
 [laughs] Good.

36:33.610 --> 36:34.486
OK.

36:50.710 --> 36:54.214
[mooing]

36:55.465 --> 36:56.257
 You're OK.

36:56.383 --> 36:57.425
We gotcha.

37:02.764 --> 37:04.641
 Atta boy.

37:04.766 --> 37:06.434
OK.

37:06.559 --> 37:07.185
Got her?

37:07.310 --> 37:08.520
 Yep.

37:08.645 --> 37:09.771
 Thanks for the help.

37:09.896 --> 37:11.189
I appreciate it.

37:11.314 --> 37:12.607
 I should be thanking you.

37:12.732 --> 37:14.109
[moos]

37:14.234 --> 37:16.194
Oh, back in this
field, breathing

37:16.319 --> 37:17.612
this country air again.

37:17.737 --> 37:21.574
 Well, you sure seem
to be in your element.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.536
Say, I've been meaning
to ask you something.

37:24.661 --> 37:25.578
 Oh.

37:25.704 --> 37:26.913
It's not about me
and Lou, is it?

37:27.038 --> 37:27.914
 Nah.

37:28.039 --> 37:29.249
No, no.

37:29.374 --> 37:30.917
I'm keeping a wide
berth on that one.

37:31.042 --> 37:33.044
Believe me.

37:33.169 --> 37:35.296
It's about that job of yours.

37:35.422 --> 37:37.298
Does it really feel like you?

37:40.010 --> 37:42.762
 I think we both know
the answer to that, Jack.

37:42.887 --> 37:45.640
I think I'm just hoping
I get used to it.

37:45.765 --> 37:47.308
 Why put yourself through that?

37:47.434 --> 37:52.355
 Because it's my job.

37:52.480 --> 37:55.817
 What if I asked you to
come back to Heartland

37:55.942 --> 37:56.776
and work for me?

37:56.901 --> 38:00.780
 [laughs] Look, I love it here.

38:00.905 --> 38:02.282
I do.

38:02.407 --> 38:04.284
But coming back would just
feel like a step backwards, you

38:04.409 --> 38:05.326
know?

38:05.452 --> 38:06.870
 OK, then.

38:06.995 --> 38:10.123
What if instead of asking
you to work for me,

38:10.248 --> 38:14.919
I asked you to work with me?

38:15.045 --> 38:16.212
 What do you mean?

38:16.338 --> 38:17.672
 A piece of our
cattle business?

38:22.093 --> 38:24.679
 Oh.

38:24.804 --> 38:27.182
I don't know what to say.

38:27.307 --> 38:28.183
Wait.

38:28.308 --> 38:29.934
What about Tim?

38:30.060 --> 38:31.269
He's gonna hate that idea.

38:31.394 --> 38:33.188
 He's busy with his
school these days.

38:33.313 --> 38:35.065
I can smooth that out.

38:35.190 --> 38:36.024
What do you think?

38:47.160 --> 38:49.454
 Hey.

38:49.579 --> 38:50.538
You can't just quit.

38:53.333 --> 38:56.711
If it wasn't for you, I never
would've tried bulldogging.

38:56.836 --> 39:00.423
 So is that your
way of saying sorry?

39:00.548 --> 39:02.509
 I just--

39:02.634 --> 39:03.677
I want you to stay.

39:06.513 --> 39:08.556
 I'll think about it.

39:08.682 --> 39:10.850
 Good.

39:10.975 --> 39:13.561
Tim's been talking
about team roping.

39:13.687 --> 39:17.899
And I thought maybe
we could be partners.

39:18.024 --> 39:20.068
 Maybe.

39:20.193 --> 39:21.027
 Cool.

39:21.152 --> 39:21.986
 Hey, Avery.

39:22.112 --> 39:23.863
Let's go.

39:23.988 --> 39:26.157
 Good to see you
two getting along.

39:26.282 --> 39:27.075
 Whatever.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.034
 Hey, Tim.

39:28.159 --> 39:28.993
You wanted to chat?

39:29.119 --> 39:30.578
 Uh, yeah.

39:30.704 --> 39:31.663
 Good job today, guys.

39:31.788 --> 39:32.997
Nice work.

39:33.123 --> 39:34.082
 Uh, Caleb.

39:34.207 --> 39:38.253
[groans] It's about your job.

39:38.378 --> 39:39.838
I need to make a change.

39:39.963 --> 39:42.090
 Hey, I totally understand.

39:42.215 --> 39:43.133
 You do?

39:43.258 --> 39:44.342
 Yeah.
Yeah.

39:44.467 --> 39:45.677
You need me more involved.

39:45.802 --> 39:47.137
And don't worry about it.
I'm all in.

39:47.262 --> 39:49.180
I'm already recruiting
as many kids as possible

39:49.305 --> 39:51.683
for the team roping clinic.

39:51.808 --> 39:52.892
 Thanks.

39:53.018 --> 39:54.978
 [laughs] This is
really working out well.

39:55.103 --> 39:56.271
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:56.396 --> 39:57.439
 Sure is.

40:02.902 --> 40:05.780
 Well, it's great to see
you guys getting along.

40:05.905 --> 40:07.741
 What am I supposed to do?

40:07.866 --> 40:13.288
How can I fire him after
that speech he gave today?

40:13.413 --> 40:15.081
He had my poster on his wall.

40:21.046 --> 40:21.796
 Hey.

40:21.921 --> 40:23.214
 Hey.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.466
How's it feeling?

40:24.591 --> 40:25.800
 A bit better.

40:25.925 --> 40:29.137
 So we can start
training again soon?

40:29.262 --> 40:33.767
 Actually, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

40:33.892 --> 40:36.895
I thought you should know
before I tell the whole team.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.313
I have to quit.

40:38.438 --> 40:41.399
I need to concentrate
on jumping.

40:41.524 --> 40:42.442
 Oh.

40:42.567 --> 40:44.402
[laughs] That sucks.

40:44.527 --> 40:46.738
[nervous laugh]
Well, I guess I'll

40:46.863 --> 40:48.656
have to find another
trick because I'll

40:48.782 --> 40:50.909
be the only headliner now.

40:51.034 --> 40:54.913
But I'm really gonna miss
you just so much at practice.

40:55.038 --> 40:55.914
So sad.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.005
 Must have been
a tough decision.

41:04.130 --> 41:05.465
You wanna talk about it?

41:05.590 --> 41:08.259
 Thanks, but not right now.

41:08.385 --> 41:12.055
[honking]

41:12.180 --> 41:14.766
Besides, I think someone's
getting a little impatient.

41:14.891 --> 41:18.186
[laughs]

41:29.072 --> 41:30.615
 Grandpa sure was
adamant about everyone

41:30.740 --> 41:32.367
coming for dinner tonight.

41:32.492 --> 41:34.119
 Well, I'm glad.

41:34.244 --> 41:35.286
You know, I missed having
dinner with the whole family.

41:35.412 --> 41:36.996
 Yeah, me too.

41:37.122 --> 41:41.042
Speaking of, was a little
awkward with Cassandra today.

41:41.167 --> 41:42.419
 Yeah.

41:42.544 --> 41:44.546
You broke your godparent's
spirits, didn't you?

41:44.671 --> 41:46.840
[laughter]

41:46.965 --> 41:48.508
Didn't you, didn't you, huh?

41:48.633 --> 41:50.301
[lyndy laughs]

41:50.427 --> 41:52.345
 That was her first laugh!

41:52.470 --> 41:53.596
[laughs]

41:53.722 --> 41:56.474
 And at Caleb and
Cass's expense.

41:56.599 --> 42:00.729
[laughter]

42:07.485 --> 42:08.862
 Oh, Mitch.

42:08.987 --> 42:10.113
Thanks for taking care of
the old guy today, huh?

42:10.238 --> 42:11.114
 Oh.

42:11.239 --> 42:12.240
Hey, it's nothing.

42:12.365 --> 42:13.283
 Yeah.

42:13.408 --> 42:14.409
Well, don't be so modest.

42:14.534 --> 42:16.161
You're great with cattle.

42:16.286 --> 42:17.537
I like your ideas too.

42:17.662 --> 42:19.706
You're really gonna
help this operation.

42:19.831 --> 42:22.083
 What operation?

42:22.208 --> 42:24.502
 Well, I've decided
that we should

42:24.627 --> 42:27.380
take Mitch on as a partner
in our cattle business.

42:27.505 --> 42:30.050
And he has graciously accepted.

42:30.175 --> 42:31.593
 Really?

42:31.718 --> 42:34.429
Didn't consult me.

42:34.554 --> 42:37.223
 Well, the three of us
are gonna talk about it,

42:37.349 --> 42:38.475
but not now.

42:38.600 --> 42:39.934
Not at the table.

42:40.060 --> 42:41.686
This is the first time
we've been able to share

42:41.811 --> 42:42.854
a dinner in a while.

42:42.979 --> 42:46.107
So let's just enjoy that.

42:46.232 --> 42:47.400
So dig in, everybody.

42:47.525 --> 42:48.568
 All right.

42:48.693 --> 42:49.903
Pass me that chicken.
- OK.

42:50.028 --> 42:50.820
I don't know if you
guys heard, but Tim

42:50.945 --> 42:51.821
did a bulldogging run today.

42:51.946 --> 42:53.031
- He did what?
- [groans]

42:53.156 --> 42:54.407
 I thought he almost
killed himself.

42:54.532 --> 42:57.285
 I just wanted to teach
the students the right--

42:57.410 --> 42:58.620
Jade bulldogged today.

42:58.745 --> 42:59.954
 You tried bulldogging?
JADE: Yeah.

43:00.080 --> 43:01.498
And it was actually
my first time.

43:01.623 --> 43:02.707
 Well, speaking
of firsts, guess

43:02.832 --> 43:04.292
who had their first laugh?

43:04.417 --> 43:06.169
 Oh, seriously?

43:06.294 --> 43:07.462
[laughter]
Aw, that's so cute.

43:07.587 --> 43:08.588
 Yes.

43:08.713 --> 43:10.048
At Caleb's expense, wasn't it?

43:10.173 --> 43:11.466
[laughter]

43:11.591 --> 43:16.388
(SINGING) --where the world
will not break me home.

43:16.513 --> 43:19.307
Never forsake me.

43:19.432 --> 43:21.476
Take me home.

43:21.601 --> 43:23.603
Take me home.

43:23.728 --> 43:29.484
For solace and safety, home.

43:29.609 --> 43:31.152
I'm going home.

43:36.700 --> 43:40.954
Take me home.

43:43.915 --> 43:47.252
The road is long and weary.

43:47.377 --> 43:51.339
But the light from
home is nearing.

43:51.464 --> 44:01.141
We all leave so we can know the
reason why we wanna go home.
