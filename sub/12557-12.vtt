WEBVTT

00:09.759 --> 00:12.262
You're traveling
through another dimension-

00:12.297 --> 00:16.015
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

00:16.050 --> 00:17.884
a journey into a wondrous land

00:17.919 --> 00:19.769
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

00:19.804 --> 00:22.889
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.906
Say, doris,
i lost one of my cuff links.

00:39.941 --> 00:41.791
Oh, i'll see if
i can find it.

00:41.826 --> 00:43.043
No, i found it.

00:43.078 --> 00:44.911
That's all right, then.

00:44.946 --> 00:48.048
I found it
in your jewel case.

00:48.083 --> 00:50.550
And i found
some other items.

00:50.585 --> 00:52.419
Oh?

00:52.454 --> 00:53.670
What about them?

00:54.921 --> 00:56.172
You tell me.

00:56.207 --> 00:59.309
There's nothing
much to tell, really.

00:59.344 --> 01:02.429
I decided to bring back
some souvenirs.

01:02.464 --> 01:03.930
Souvenirs?

01:03.965 --> 01:05.181
A human finger?

01:05.215 --> 01:06.433
A sacred death stone?

01:06.468 --> 01:10.186
A vulture's claw?

01:10.221 --> 01:12.072
Baubles of a witch doctor.

01:12.107 --> 01:14.574
That's all these are to you,
souvenirs?

01:15.191 --> 01:16.576
Of course.

01:16.611 --> 01:19.079
Nothing else?
Are you sure?

01:20.947 --> 01:22.832
Certainly, i'm sure.

01:25.952 --> 01:30.957
Then you won't mind if i
dispose of them, will you?

01:33.460 --> 01:34.711
Alan, don't!

01:34.746 --> 01:35.962
Please don't!

01:35.997 --> 01:38.465
Please don't, alan!
Please don't!
Why not?

01:39.099 --> 01:39.849
No!

01:41.101 --> 01:44.721
All right, now,
are there any more

01:44.756 --> 01:46.606
souvenirs?

01:49.109 --> 01:52.228
We aren't in africa any longer,
we're here in new york.

01:52.263 --> 01:54.114
Do you understand
what i'm saying?

01:54.149 --> 01:55.865
This is for weak people,

01:55.900 --> 01:58.985
ignorant, uncivilized people
who don't know any better,

01:59.020 --> 02:00.870
not for you, or me.

02:00.905 --> 02:02.989
Doris, we've done
nothing wrong.

02:03.024 --> 02:04.874
We have nothing
to fear.

02:04.909 --> 02:07.994
Least of all
from a bunch of witch doctors

02:08.029 --> 02:09.878
5,000 miles away.

02:09.913 --> 02:11.748
What are you afraid of?

02:11.783 --> 02:12.749
Africa.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.000
Do you remember

02:14.035 --> 02:16.503
what the old shaman
said long ago

02:16.538 --> 02:18.388
when the men
started drilling?

02:18.423 --> 02:20.256
He said we were
wounding the land,

02:20.291 --> 02:22.142
hurting it,
making it bleed.

02:22.177 --> 02:24.511
Alan, he said that land
would make us pay.

02:24.546 --> 02:26.396
Doris, we left
africa weeks ago.

02:26.431 --> 02:27.397
Did we? Well, i wonder.

02:27.432 --> 02:29.899
Alan, sometimes at night
i can feel it,

02:29.934 --> 02:34.904
all around me,
like some huge, dark animal.

02:34.939 --> 02:35.522
Alan, please.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.024
Please don't
let them go there.

02:38.059 --> 02:39.909
Tell them it won't work.

02:39.944 --> 02:43.029
Stop them now while
there's still time, please!

02:57.794 --> 03:00.930
It's my job to engineer
a hydroelectric project,

03:00.965 --> 03:03.433
not pander to ignorant
witch doctors.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.313
I'll try to be back early.

03:17.348 --> 03:19.199
You'll never be back.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.821
Don't open the door.

03:32.113 --> 03:33.963
The carcass of a goat,

03:34.581 --> 03:36.466
a dead finger,

03:36.501 --> 03:38.968
a few bits
of broken glass and stone

03:39.003 --> 03:43.339
and mr. Alan richards,
a modern man of a modern age,

03:43.374 --> 03:44.591
hating with all his heart

03:44.626 --> 03:46.476
something
in which he cannot believe

03:46.511 --> 03:48.978
and preparing-
although he doesn't know it-

03:49.013 --> 03:50.847
to take the longest walk
of his life

03:50.882 --> 03:55.852
right down to the center
of the twilight zone.

04:12.285 --> 04:15.421
Levelling and drainage
have already been started

04:15.456 --> 04:17.923
as well as preliminary work
on the dam itself.

04:18.541 --> 04:21.043
Our time of completion
will have to be upped

04:21.079 --> 04:22.929
by three to six months,

04:22.964 --> 04:25.431
but this shouldn't affect
our general cost

04:26.049 --> 04:27.934
more than
a few thousand dollars.

04:27.969 --> 04:29.686
Well, it's
getting very late.

04:29.721 --> 04:30.937
Before we make
a decision,

04:30.972 --> 04:33.439
i have a few questions
if you don't mind.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.691
Certainly, sir.

04:34.726 --> 04:37.193
I'm sure you've
considered this
carefully,

04:37.228 --> 04:39.062
but, for my
own curiosity,

04:39.097 --> 04:40.313
what about
the natives?

04:40.348 --> 04:41.564
Natives?

04:41.599 --> 04:43.449
What about them, sir?

04:43.484 --> 04:45.952
Well, what's
their attitude?

04:45.987 --> 04:47.203
How are they
reacting?

04:47.238 --> 04:49.072
As far as i know...

04:49.107 --> 04:52.208
well, the kekouyu
are a violent people.

04:52.243 --> 04:54.460
They resent
the loss of their homes.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.329
They resent the enterprise

04:56.364 --> 04:58.831
even though
they'll benefit eventually.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.083
They resent us.

05:00.118 --> 05:05.722
But i doubt they'll cause
any serious disturbance.

05:05.757 --> 05:09.592
Except... for uchawi.

05:09.627 --> 05:11.227
Uchawi?

05:12.345 --> 05:13.596
Uh... witchcraft.

05:14.632 --> 05:16.482
A number of
shamans decided

05:16.517 --> 05:20.236
to put a curse on everyone
connected with the enterprise

05:20.271 --> 05:23.990
effective upon the decision
to go ahead with the project.

05:24.025 --> 05:25.858
What sort of a curse,
mr. Richards?

05:25.893 --> 05:27.744
The usual:

05:27.779 --> 05:29.612
A slow,
painful death.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.366
Now, gentlemen,
i assure you,

05:33.401 --> 05:35.868
there's nothing at all
funny about uchawi.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.754
Oh, you're
not serious.

05:37.789 --> 05:38.755
I am, i've seen it work.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.623
I have seen healthy men
sicken and die

05:40.658 --> 05:43.760
within ten minutes of the time
set by the witch doctors

05:43.795 --> 05:45.011
who cursed them-

05:45.046 --> 05:46.879
healthy men. And women.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.382
They weren't touched.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.267
They weren't poisoned.

05:51.302 --> 05:53.770
They weren't harmed in any way.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.638
They just died.

05:55.673 --> 05:57.774
Don't talk rubbish.

05:57.809 --> 05:59.025
Alan...
wait a minute,

05:59.060 --> 06:00.893
just a second.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.779
Mr. Sinclair.

06:02.814 --> 06:05.281
What time is it?

06:05.316 --> 06:06.899
Oh, say,
what's this

06:06.934 --> 06:08.785
you're wearing
on your watch chain?

06:08.820 --> 06:10.036
Why, it's...

06:10.071 --> 06:11.404
a rabbit's foot,
isn't it?

06:11.439 --> 06:13.289
Why do you
wear that?
Now, see here.

06:13.324 --> 06:15.158
It's for luck,
isn't it?

06:15.193 --> 06:18.911
Well, what's that
got to do with magic?

06:19.545 --> 06:21.414
Sinclair carries
the severed foot

06:21.449 --> 06:23.916
of a dead animal
for good fortune

06:23.951 --> 06:27.053
and can't see what
that's to do with magic?

06:31.424 --> 06:32.675
Hardy is amused.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.812
Although it's known
he's a superstitious man

06:35.847 --> 06:38.314
or have you finally
given up astrology?

06:38.349 --> 06:40.183
Well...

06:40.218 --> 06:42.068
now, here's a 20th-century man

06:42.103 --> 06:45.188
who allows the stars
to make his decisions.

06:45.223 --> 06:48.191
And a fine job they've done
of it, too, young man.

06:48.226 --> 06:49.325
That's exactly what

06:49.360 --> 06:51.828
a kekouyu witch doctor
said to me

06:51.863 --> 06:53.696
when i suggested
panther bones

06:53.731 --> 06:56.199
could not
foretell the future.

06:57.735 --> 07:00.203
You needn't smile,
mr. Templeton.

07:00.238 --> 07:02.088
I've seen you
knock on wood

07:02.123 --> 07:03.339
more than once.

07:03.374 --> 07:04.590
Oh, alan...

07:04.625 --> 07:06.459
mr. Fleming,
when did you last

07:06.494 --> 07:07.710
walk under a ladder?

07:07.745 --> 07:09.595
Throw salt over
your shoulder?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.464
All right,
mr. Richards

07:11.499 --> 07:12.715
you've made
your point.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.852
A multl-billion corporation
run by witches...

07:15.887 --> 07:17.103
warlocks.

07:17.138 --> 07:18.971
In a 40-story building

07:19.006 --> 07:22.108
that doesn't even
have a 13th floor.

07:22.143 --> 07:23.359
Now, gentlemen, i...

07:23.394 --> 07:24.610
mr. Richards!

07:36.489 --> 07:37.740
Chad.

07:37.775 --> 07:38.991
Tell me something

07:39.026 --> 07:42.745
if you wanted to get
hold of a dead goat

07:42.780 --> 07:43.996
on an hour's notice,

07:44.031 --> 07:46.382
where would
you go?

07:47.633 --> 07:49.502
To a psychiatrist.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.003
No, i'm serious.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.505
Well, so am i.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.390
You really want
a dead goat?

07:54.425 --> 07:56.893
No.
Then what are you
talking about?

07:58.179 --> 08:00.012
I'll do it.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.397
Hey.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.900
What's this?

08:09.155 --> 08:13.526
That, my dear chad,
is kipitu.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.028
A protective amulet.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.914
Where did it
come from?

08:17.949 --> 08:20.416
Doris.

08:20.451 --> 08:22.285
You see, if this
is a lion's tooth,

08:22.320 --> 08:25.421
i gather i'm being
protected from lions.

08:25.456 --> 08:27.290
In, uh, new york city?

08:27.325 --> 08:27.924
Yeah.

08:27.959 --> 08:29.792
Well, got to admit

08:29.827 --> 08:31.043
they're doing a fine job.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.546
This is how doris
looks at it.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.432
What will you do about doris?

08:36.467 --> 08:37.799
I don't know.

08:37.835 --> 08:39.051
She's sick,
isn't she?

08:39.086 --> 08:40.937
So are half the city's people!

08:40.972 --> 08:43.306
My wife carries
a lion's tooth,

08:43.341 --> 08:45.808
the company president,
a rabbit's foot-

08:45.843 --> 08:48.311
it's all the same,
same rotten disease.

08:48.346 --> 08:50.813
It's eating away at
the strength, the will,

08:50.848 --> 08:52.064
the very soul of me.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.950
Hey, hey, alan.

08:53.985 --> 08:56.452
Think you better
have another drink.

08:56.487 --> 08:57.703
Hmm-mm.

08:57.738 --> 08:58.955
Alan, take it easy.

08:58.990 --> 09:02.074
A guy doesn't get
this worked up

09:02.109 --> 09:04.577
about something
he doesn't believe in.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.462
What do you mean?

09:07.079 --> 09:08.965
Oh, nothing.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.216
Come on.

09:10.251 --> 09:12.084
Look, it's 3:00.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.336
Doris will be worried.

09:13.371 --> 09:17.089
No, i called her,
i told her i'd be late.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.975
Did you pay?

09:19.010 --> 09:19.592
Yeah.

09:21.477 --> 09:22.728
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:23.346 --> 09:23.980
Good night.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.501
Hey, chad!

10:09.141 --> 10:10.393
Hey.

10:10.428 --> 10:11.644
Anybody there?

11:21.380 --> 11:23.883
Hello?

12:37.491 --> 12:41.844
Cab, mister?

12:41.879 --> 12:42.595
Shuler house.

12:42.630 --> 12:45.097
Right.

13:17.246 --> 13:21.000
Driver, the light's green.

13:21.035 --> 13:22.885
You can go now.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.753
Driver.

13:24.788 --> 13:26.639
The light's green.

15:00.884 --> 15:04.486
Oh.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.616
Hey, excuse me, mister.

15:17.651 --> 15:20.753
I've had nothing
to eat for two days.

15:20.788 --> 15:24.506
I'd surely appreciate it
if you could help me out.

15:24.541 --> 15:26.375
Sure...

15:27.009 --> 15:28.877
sure, sure.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.380
Yes, sir.

15:34.551 --> 15:37.019
God bless you, mister.

15:37.054 --> 15:39.521
Hey, wait a minute.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.144
Where's that sound
coming from?

15:50.184 --> 15:52.651
What sound was that?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.907
Those drums.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.546
I don't hear
no drums.

16:04.581 --> 16:06.415
Listen.

16:07.701 --> 16:11.420
You mean to tell me
you can't hear that?

16:11.455 --> 16:13.922
Huh, you'll have
to excuse me.

16:13.957 --> 16:17.059
My ears aren't as good
as they used to be.

16:17.094 --> 16:18.927
Say, wait a minute.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.315
How would you like
to make some money?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.069
Doing what?

16:27.104 --> 16:28.937
I'm trying to get home

16:28.972 --> 16:30.823
on the other side
of the park.

16:30.858 --> 16:34.576
If you walk with me,
i'll give you ten dollars.

16:45.873 --> 16:48.340
Now, don't tell me
you can't hear tha...

16:52.594 --> 16:55.347
hey!

16:55.382 --> 16:59.101
Come back!

17:08.477 --> 17:10.979
Hey, come back!
