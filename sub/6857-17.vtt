00:16.001 --> 00:18.002
The death toll rises,

00:18.003 --> 00:20.103
as the battles intensify

00:20.104 --> 00:22.604
and threaten a growing
number of republic worlds.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.905
Planets are left to survive on their own

00:24.906 --> 00:27.906
while the Jedi struggle to
fight a war on many fronts.

00:27.907 --> 00:30.607
A series of medical stations
have been established

00:30.608 --> 00:32.607
as a lifeline for those in need.

00:32.609 --> 00:34.909
But the facilities are easy prey

00:34.910 --> 00:36.510
for separatist attacks.

00:36.511 --> 00:39.811
After losing contact with the
medical station orbiting Felucia,

00:39.812 --> 00:43.112
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin
Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano

00:43.113 --> 00:45.113
are sent to investigate.

00:48.114 --> 00:49.814
That's Felucia. Dead ahead.

00:49.815 --> 00:51.815
But where's the medical station?

00:51.816 --> 00:53.816
I don't see anything on my scanners.

00:53.817 --> 00:55.417
Wait, there's something.

01:01.018 --> 01:02.318
Vulture droids.

01:02.319 --> 01:03.619
Hang on.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.820
I guess we know what happened
to the medical station.

01:14.221 --> 01:15.821
That's not good.

01:15.822 --> 01:17.822
They took out the plasma conduit.

01:25.223 --> 01:26.823
You thinking what I'm thinking?

01:26.824 --> 01:28.424
Almost certainly not.

01:28.425 --> 01:30.725
We're doing this the hard way.

01:30.726 --> 01:32.326
Starting ejection sequence.

01:34.327 --> 01:37.627
How come every time you fly, we crash?

01:37.628 --> 01:40.128
It's not my fault. It's the ship.

01:41.329 --> 01:42.829
Ready to eject.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.430
Wait...

01:44.431 --> 01:45.731
Now!

01:56.432 --> 01:58.032
You always

01:58.033 --> 01:59.333
blame the ship.

02:12.334 --> 02:13.934
You alright there, Master?

02:13.935 --> 02:16.035
I'm fine, Anakin.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.536
Where on Felucia do you think we are?

02:18.537 --> 02:20.137
I'm not sure.

02:22.138 --> 02:24.438
I don't like the sound of that.

02:24.439 --> 02:26.439
And I don't like the look of that.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.840
We don't want to scare 'em.

02:35.841 --> 02:38.641
We can't just wander
around. We need a plan.

02:38.642 --> 02:40.442
You taught me to go on instinct.

02:40.443 --> 02:42.743
My instincts say to go that way.

02:42.744 --> 02:44.744
That doesn't seem right.

02:44.745 --> 02:46.745
I think we should go this way.

02:46.746 --> 02:48.346
Why do you ask for my opinion?

02:48.347 --> 02:49.947
You never do things my way.

02:49.948 --> 02:51.548
We crashed the ship your way.

02:51.549 --> 02:52.849
Very funny.

02:52.850 --> 02:55.150
I see your sense of humour
survived the landing.

02:55.151 --> 02:56.451
It's about the only thing.

02:56.452 --> 02:59.452
If you two are done arguing,

02:59.453 --> 03:01.753
I think there's some smoke on the horizon.

03:01.754 --> 03:03.354
Which means people.

03:03.355 --> 03:04.955
And a way off this planet.

03:17.256 --> 03:18.856
Look, there's a village.

03:18.857 --> 03:21.157
Maybe they have a ship we can "borrow".

03:31.858 --> 03:33.858
Hmm. They're growing healing herbs.

03:33.859 --> 03:35.559
Sillum, I believe.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.260
One of the most valuable
crops in the galaxy.

03:46.161 --> 03:48.461
This place looks deserted.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.062
I don't believe it is.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.063
The crops are ready to be harvested.

03:52.064 --> 03:55.164
Tools are lying about. Something's amiss.

03:55.165 --> 03:58.165
Well, there's one thing
I learned where I grew up.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.766
You want to know what
a farmer is up to,...

04:00.767 --> 04:02.367
look in their barn.

04:06.368 --> 04:09.368
This is an odd ship for farmers.

04:09.369 --> 04:11.669
Perhaps someone is here
to pick up the sillum.

04:11.670 --> 04:13.370
I still don't get it.

04:13.371 --> 04:15.371
Where is everyone?

04:36.072 --> 04:37.672
Mystery solved.

04:37.673 --> 04:39.673
They're terrified.

04:39.674 --> 04:42.174
It's OK. We won't hurt you.

04:43.475 --> 04:46.175
Kindly drop your weapons, Jedi.

04:46.176 --> 04:48.176
Take it easy.

04:48.177 --> 04:49.777
We don't want any trouble.

04:52.079 --> 04:54.579
It's not always about the numbers.

04:54.580 --> 04:58.080
Four on one is hardly a fair fight,

04:58.081 --> 05:00.081
even for a Jedi.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.382
Wait a minute. Four on one?

05:02.383 --> 05:04.383
You mean four on two?

05:04.384 --> 05:07.084
We don't count you.

05:07.085 --> 05:09.085
Do you count me?

05:15.086 --> 05:17.186
Stop. Don't harm them.

05:17.187 --> 05:19.687
Can't you see these are Jedi?

05:19.688 --> 05:20.988
We are saved.

05:20.989 --> 05:22.289
Saved?

05:22.290 --> 05:24.290
Need I remind you,

05:24.291 --> 05:26.591
you already made a deal with us?

05:26.592 --> 05:28.192
But with the Jedis' help...

05:28.193 --> 05:31.193
Excuse me, but help you with what?

05:32.194 --> 05:34.494
Pirates.

05:37.095 --> 05:38.695
Simply stated,

05:38.696 --> 05:41.696
if we don't give the pirates
a portion of our crop,

05:41.697 --> 05:44.697
they will destroy our homes,

05:44.698 --> 05:46.698
with us in them.

05:46.699 --> 05:48.799
Hmm. I see your dilemma.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.500
Sillum farming is a meagre trade

05:51.501 --> 05:53.201
Without our herbs to sell

05:53.202 --> 05:55.502
we will have no money for food,

05:55.503 --> 05:57.803
fuel or equipment.

05:57.804 --> 06:00.304
And yet you can afford to pay mercenaries.

06:00.305 --> 06:02.005
These bounty hunters

06:02.006 --> 06:06.006
drive a more reasonable
bargain than pirates.

06:06.007 --> 06:08.007
Why not just fight them yourselves?

06:08.008 --> 06:10.008
Easy for you perhaps,

06:10.009 --> 06:11.609
but look at us.

06:11.610 --> 06:14.910
We are farmers, not warriors.

06:14.911 --> 06:19.011
Even with the bounty hunters'
help, I had feared the worst.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.612
But now there are seven of you.

06:21.613 --> 06:24.613
What do you want, Jedi?

06:24.614 --> 06:28.614
We need a ship. Ours is beyond repair.

06:28.615 --> 06:30.915
The one in the barn. That'll do.

06:30.916 --> 06:34.616
That's our ride. It doesn't
go anywhere without us.

06:34.617 --> 06:36.417
And right now we are busy.

06:36.418 --> 06:38.418
Busy extorting farmers?

06:38.419 --> 06:41.319
I don't hear you offering to help.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.020
Unfortunately,

06:43.021 --> 06:45.521
we couldn't help even if we wanted to.

06:45.522 --> 06:46.822
What?

06:48.823 --> 06:51.823
Master, these farmers are in trouble.

06:51.824 --> 06:53.124
Why can't we help them?

06:53.125 --> 06:55.825
Believe me, I would like nothing more.

06:55.826 --> 06:59.126
However, we need to report that a
medical station has been destroyed.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.427
If we stay too long,

07:00.428 --> 07:02.428
the separatists will show up here.

07:02.429 --> 07:03.929
- But...
- Better they get robbed

07:03.930 --> 07:06.730
by pirates than attract the
interest of General Grievous.

07:06.731 --> 07:10.031
Pirates! Pirates, pirates.
The pirates are back.

07:19.032 --> 07:20.532
That's far enough.

07:20.533 --> 07:24.333
I speak for the people of this village.

07:24.334 --> 07:26.334
State your name and business.

07:26.335 --> 07:28.335
My name is my own business.

07:28.336 --> 07:31.336
And my business is taking what's ours!

07:31.337 --> 07:35.337
There is nothing here that's
yours. Unless you're here to buy it.

07:35.338 --> 07:36.938
Buy it? Ha ha!

07:39.639 --> 07:42.939
Skywalker!

07:42.940 --> 07:46.340
I can't believe you came
all this way to see me.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.941
- Hondo.
- Hondo.

07:47.942 --> 07:49.542
You know each other?

07:49.543 --> 07:51.543
Of course we do.

07:51.544 --> 07:55.044
Tell them how far back we go.

07:55.045 --> 07:57.045
Too far, I'm afraid.

07:57.046 --> 08:00.046
Ha ha! And I thought we were friends.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.547
If you're truly interested
in friendship, Hondo,

08:02.548 --> 08:05.548
might I suggest you stop
threatening these farmers?

08:05.549 --> 08:07.149
Threatening them?

08:07.150 --> 08:10.450
Oh, please tell me you
have not been listening

08:10.451 --> 08:12.951
to these bounty-hunting scum.

08:12.952 --> 08:17.252
Scum? We're just here to help
them protect what's theirs.

08:17.253 --> 08:19.953
Oh, come, come, my dear.

08:19.954 --> 08:22.254
How much are they paying you?

08:22.255 --> 08:23.855
Ba, ba! It does not matter.

08:23.856 --> 08:25.856
Whatever it is, I will double it.

08:25.857 --> 08:29.857
And all you have to do to earn it is...

08:29.858 --> 08:31.358
step aside.

08:31.359 --> 08:34.359
We don't break deals.

08:37.460 --> 08:39.059
Steady, everyone.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.361
What is your stake, anyway?

08:41.361 --> 08:42.861
All we want

08:42.863 --> 08:44.863
is a ride to the nearest republic outpost.

08:44.864 --> 08:46.864
And I'm willing to pay
you handsomely for it.

08:46.865 --> 08:49.365
Twice what you could
make selling this crop.

08:49.366 --> 08:52.225
Well, now, how do you plan to pay me?

08:52.226 --> 08:54.478
A funds transfer when we arrive.

08:54.479 --> 08:59.118
Republic credit? Tut. We've
been over this before, Kenobi.

08:59.119 --> 09:01.952
My associates don't accept that currency.

09:01.953 --> 09:04.770
I'm offering a deal that benefits us all.

09:04.771 --> 09:07.740
Don't let your greed
blind you to that fact.

09:07.741 --> 09:10.117
You know, I like you, Kenobi.

09:10.118 --> 09:11.143
But...

09:11.144 --> 09:15.543
no one leaves this planet
until I get my sillum.

09:15.544 --> 09:17.795
Then I hope you enjoy it here.

09:17.796 --> 09:20.938
Because you'll be staying
a long time, parasite!

09:22.173 --> 09:25.564
You know, this crop
has not been harvested.

09:26.642 --> 09:28.403
You better hurry, old man,

09:28.404 --> 09:30.904
before things start to... die on you.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.702
When the attack comes, it
will come from two fronts.

09:43.703 --> 09:46.660
The forest to the south
and the ridge to the north.

09:46.661 --> 09:49.896
Whatever you do, you
must defend both sides.

09:49.897 --> 09:51.910
But there are only four of them.

09:51.911 --> 09:55.477
How can four bounty hunters
defend against so many?

09:58.293 --> 09:59.766
The farmers are right.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.868
These bounty hunters don't stand a chance.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.587
We've been over this, Anakin.

10:03.588 --> 10:07.450
You seem to lack confidence
in our abilities, young Jedi.

10:07.451 --> 10:09.162
I'm sure you're good at what you do.

10:09.163 --> 10:11.051
But you are in way too deep.

10:11.052 --> 10:14.460
Said the peacekeeper who
fails to keep the peace.

10:14.461 --> 10:16.858
The rift in the galaxy is not our fault.

10:16.859 --> 10:19.926
If more worlds would stand up for
themselves against the separatists,

10:19.927 --> 10:22.071
this war would have been over long ago.

10:22.690 --> 10:26.425
That's it. We'll just train the
villagers to defend themselves.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.723
But we are just simple farmers.

10:28.724 --> 10:31.294
Why are we paying bounty
hunters to defend us

10:31.295 --> 10:34.169
if we're just going to
end up doing it ourselves?

10:34.170 --> 10:35.886
Hush.

10:35.887 --> 10:38.195
Trust me. We'll have you ready.

10:46.957 --> 10:49.201
Put it in the barn, every bushel.

10:53.948 --> 10:55.856
Alright, everyone, form up.

10:59.607 --> 11:02.127
Um, divide into rows of five.

11:06.741 --> 11:10.501
I told you, we are not soldiers.
We do not even have weapons.

11:12.903 --> 11:14.403
May I?

11:28.106 --> 11:29.679
Yeah. These'll do.

11:33.543 --> 11:36.570
What happens if you need the
barn as a fallback position?

11:36.571 --> 11:39.670
With all the sillum here it will be
difficult to squeeze the farmers in.

11:40.343 --> 11:41.714
There's room.

11:41.715 --> 11:44.722
I worry that you care more
for the safety of the sillum

11:44.723 --> 11:46.976
than you do for the
safety of the villagers.

11:46.977 --> 11:50.679
You think I'm only worried
about my profit. Is that it?

11:50.680 --> 11:52.781
The thought had crossed my mind.

11:52.782 --> 11:57.016
So in your mind I am just
like any other pirate?

11:59.760 --> 12:02.952
- Am I wrong?
- Not entirely.

12:02.953 --> 12:06.105
But it is easier to protect
the villagers and the sillum

12:06.106 --> 12:08.294
if they are both in the same place.

12:08.295 --> 12:11.000
- Might I suggest
- You might suggest

12:11.001 --> 12:13.149
anything you like, General Kenobi.

12:13.150 --> 12:17.070
But I know what I am doing.
I will keep these people safe

12:17.071 --> 12:18.571
my way.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.057
Seripas, it's too heavy!

12:51.343 --> 12:52.843
Seripas?

12:54.235 --> 12:57.737
Don't look! I'm having a suit malfunction.

13:06.792 --> 13:08.851
Ha... Not very intimidating, am I?

13:08.852 --> 13:11.304
You don't have to look tough to be tough.

13:19.020 --> 13:21.063
I thank you for your help.

13:47.772 --> 13:49.819
The bounty hunter is right.

13:49.820 --> 13:51.643
Every minute you waste teaching us

13:51.644 --> 13:53.575
to twirl these poles

13:53.576 --> 13:57.377
is time you could have spent
beating those pirates yourself.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.948
And what good would that do you?

13:58.949 --> 14:01.837
Another band of brigands would come along.

14:01.838 --> 14:03.952
Or do you intend to give
away part of your crop

14:03.953 --> 14:05.752
every harvest season?

14:05.753 --> 14:09.321
If you make us do this, there
won't be another harvest season.

14:12.836 --> 14:16.380
Alright, everyone, get back
in position. Let's continue.

14:24.684 --> 14:26.217
Oh, what have we here?

14:26.848 --> 14:29.237
Getting ready for a fight, are we?

14:34.084 --> 14:35.695
There. A scout!

14:39.040 --> 14:40.340
Embo!

15:13.647 --> 15:15.147
Quick work.

15:17.136 --> 15:20.582
Yes, but when this scout
fails to report to Hondo

15:20.583 --> 15:23.065
he'll be coming, soon.

15:28.660 --> 15:32.957
The scout has not checked in from
the village. He's long overdue.

15:33.679 --> 15:35.348
Well, well.

15:35.349 --> 15:38.748
So it looks like the
Jedi are getting involved.

15:38.749 --> 15:41.095
Or at least we now know

15:41.096 --> 15:43.935
we can't take these villagers for granted.

15:43.936 --> 15:45.678
But you know what I always say

15:45.679 --> 15:49.569
speak softly and drive a big tank.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.471
The farmers are in position.

15:55.472 --> 15:57.662
Well, the ones who stuck around anyway.

15:57.663 --> 16:00.134
Very well, Anakin. Turn on the fence.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.722
Battle positions, everyone!

17:23.672 --> 17:25.172
Embo!

17:28.268 --> 17:30.340
Can you hear me?

17:30.341 --> 17:32.486
You'll be alright. We'll get you inside.

17:34.601 --> 17:36.985
Everyone, fall back to the barn!

17:38.464 --> 17:41.444
That tank is going to
tear the villagers apart.

17:46.009 --> 17:49.023
Get him inside. We'll hold
them off as long as we can.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.647
Die, Jedi scum!

18:20.929 --> 18:23.372
- No!
- Watch your flank!

18:49.430 --> 18:52.227
Your situation is hopeless, Skywalker.

19:04.002 --> 19:07.216
- Welcome back. Are you alright?
- Fine.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.287
The captain!

19:26.405 --> 19:27.905
Let's go!

19:31.354 --> 19:33.206
The day is won.

19:35.226 --> 19:36.726
Help me.

19:39.467 --> 19:43.080
Skywalker, let me call off my men.

19:58.152 --> 20:00.057
This effort

20:00.058 --> 20:02.058
is no longer

20:02.059 --> 20:04.059
profitable!

20:13.447 --> 20:15.598
There are crops to harvest,

20:15.599 --> 20:19.464
fields to till, hearts to rebuild.

20:19.465 --> 20:21.749
Now, let's get to work.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.793
How can I ever thank you
for saving our village?

20:26.794 --> 20:30.301
We didn't save your
village. Your people did.

20:30.302 --> 20:32.816
The first time in my memory

20:32.817 --> 20:35.539
my people don't have to be afraid.

20:36.226 --> 20:38.417
We will never forget you.

20:40.891 --> 20:44.157
I seem to find myself light on company.

20:44.158 --> 20:47.627
Still need that ride back
to the republic outpost?

20:47.628 --> 20:50.220
If it wouldn't be any inconvenience.

20:50.221 --> 20:53.416
On the contrary, it would be my pleasure.
