00:15.267 --> 00:17.133
- Where have you been?

00:17.200 --> 00:20.400
I promised Babe we'd finish
the first test by 4:30.

00:20.467 --> 00:22.533
- Uh, it's not that easy
finding six ballerinas

00:22.600 --> 00:25.167
in Brooklyn

00:27.167 --> 00:28.700
Hey! Ladies!
Come this way!

00:28.767 --> 00:30.000

00:30.067 --> 00:31.533
to The Crispin Glover
School of Dance

00:31.600 --> 00:32.700

00:32.767 --> 00:34.167

00:54.300 --> 00:57.333
- Uh, where did you
find those...ladies?

00:59.633 --> 01:01.600
- I just walked the streets,
askin' any lady I saw

01:01.667 --> 01:03.567
if she'd put on a ballet suit
for twenty bucks.

01:03.633 --> 01:07.500
P.S.--I need a hundred

Who can say that with me?

01:21.500 --> 01:23.400
"Ballarina."

01:26.233 --> 01:28.400

you're tellin' me

21:33.300 --> 21:35.467
that I shaved my head bald,

21:35.533 --> 21:37.967
and ate 35 pounds
of soft cheese,

21:38.033 --> 21:40.700
for nothin'?!?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.100
- I guess so..
- That seems to be the case.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.067
- Pretty dumb, huh?

21:44.133 --> 21:45.733
- Rawr! Ahhh!

21:49.067 --> 21:51.100
- Daww, why'd you break
my new camera?!?

21:51.167 --> 21:53.733
- 'Cuz why should I be
the only one who's upset?!?

21:53.800 --> 21:56.767
- Hey, its not my fault you kept
eating cheese and--

21:56.833 --> 21:58.233
- I don't wanna see
the camera no more!

21:58.300 --> 22:01.400
- Ah! Ah! Come on!

22:01.467 --> 22:03.100
- Let's be happy, y'know.

22:03.167 --> 22:04.933
Dub, at least you got
the part in the movie.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.533
And we solved our
bench problem.

22:09.233 --> 22:10.667
- Uh...did we?

22:14.200 --> 22:15.867
- How'd he get in here?

22:16.900 --> 22:19.400
- Get off our bench!
- Out!

22:19.467 --> 22:20.567
- Wahhh!
- Stop crying and get out!

22:20.633 --> 22:22.300
- Buh-bye!
- Bye!

22:22.367 --> 22:23.800
- [ giggles ]

22:23.867 --> 22:25.733
- Go away!
- Wahhhhh!

22:26.767 --> 22:29.733
[ oven bell ]
- Mmm.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.133
