[police sirens]

03:15.403 --> 03:16.695
[whistles]

03:47.685 --> 03:51.230
Have a shot, kid.
A little nerve tonic.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.818
I'm not nervous, Cragie.
I just gotta take a leak.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.863
- Then do it now.
- On some poor bastard's grave?

04:00.031 --> 04:01.281
[Cragie] What do you give a shit?

04:01.449 --> 04:05.786
If someone was smart, they'd rip out
these graves and plant tomatoes.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.664
These people are no good.
They're dead.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.350
Say, hey, Cub fans.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.686
Baby, I sure hope
you all are down there...

04:30.853 --> 04:33.313
'cause we got the big game today.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.690
Today is our day, baby.

04:34.857 --> 04:38.443

04:38.611 --> 04:41.113
[man on radio continues]

04:44.534 --> 04:45.659
Dig this, man.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.744
All you cats on the home team,
listen up.

04:47.912 --> 04:50.580
Spider's getting ready
to make the big play.

04:50.748 --> 04:54.293
If you mothers drop that ball,
the Spider's--

04:57.797 --> 05:00.882
- What's happening, Doc?
- There you are.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.802
You take too fucking long.
Every day you're late.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.804
[conversation continues faintly]

05:05.972 --> 05:10.017
- Get your ass in the car.
- [Doc] I got everything we need.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.769
- Got a million places to go.
- [Spider] Let's get out of here.

05:12.937 --> 05:17.733
- They'll be waiting.
- Okay, home team, ready in the bullpen.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.902
Covering you, shortstop.
Double play. We'll get the nut.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.410
- Center's in.
- Where's Cragie?

05:28.578 --> 05:33.040
- Talk to me, left field.
- Damn it. Left field is in position.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.167
[man] Okay, guys,
run around first base.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.045
- Double play, you got them in sight?
- [man 2] Yeah, we got the eyes on them.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.505
- He's heading for the alley.
- [Doc] What the fuck is this?

05:40.673 --> 05:44.885
I get up early. This guy has my nose
in his pocket at 6:30 in the morning.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.013
I come around these funky
neighborhoods. I'm sick of it.

05:48.181 --> 05:53.268
I've been on the phone three days.
I'm glad to get out, though.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.396
You can't tell nobody
about this kind of stress.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.689
How's somebody gonna relate?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.947
All right, boys, here we go.

06:06.866 --> 06:10.035
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.170
Leave a space
for the good guys.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.298
I ain't ever letting her
out of my sight.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.300
[dog barking]

06:27.470 --> 06:30.847
This is lovely. Look at this.
The other guys went to Brazil.

06:31.015 --> 06:35.644
Took 12 people for a party.
This is my vacation. Ain't this nice?

06:39.982 --> 06:43.068
- Spider, this ain't my style.
- [Spider] I can dig it, baby.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.904
It's too much like real work
even for me.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.492
You'll have everything you want
in two hours. All the action you need.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.037
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.164
[faint music on radio]

07:07.343 --> 07:09.469
Come on, baby.

07:09.637 --> 07:12.973
- Back off.
- Come on, baby.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.852
- Do your thing, Pancho.
- Hey, man, we're clean.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.271
- You think we're goddamn fools?
- Watch it.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.400
- Don't you know these guys, Spider?
- We ought to get married.

07:23.568 --> 07:28.113
We just want to do a little business.
Does this guy speak English?

07:29.407 --> 07:33.702
- [Spider] Fuck, this is routine.
- [Doc] I can't believe this.

07:34.328 --> 07:39.082
- Do this every fucking time.
- I should have taken a Valium.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.170
Found you a present.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.088
These things will test your head.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.385
- I know these people, trust me.
- [man whistling]

07:57.101 --> 07:58.894
[speaking Spanish]

08:06.861 --> 08:08.528
I like the way it sounds.
Where's that money?

08:08.696 --> 08:11.406
That's mine until it's yours.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.076
[Doc muttering]

08:16.913 --> 08:18.497
[speaking Spanish]

08:25.505 --> 08:27.756
[Doc] I don't like people
that don't want to shake my hand.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.719
I don't care where they come from.
I don't give a fuck what they represent.

08:32.886 --> 08:36.765
I don't dig motherfuckers
that don't shake my hand.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.437
[bell tolling]

08:46.734 --> 08:51.238
- Come on, Eenie. Move your ass.
- What are those guys up to?

08:51.405 --> 08:54.074
They're going to work.
What do you think?

08:54.242 --> 08:57.285
- Let's go.
- [man] At this hour?

08:57.453 --> 08:59.371
[man 2] Don't worry about it.
Let it roll.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.291
They got a hard-ass for a boss,
like us.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.925
I just want to get out of here
real quick with my deal...

09:12.093 --> 09:15.971
and I want to find out
what's going on here today.

09:23.479 --> 09:26.022
[children shouting in Spanish]

09:39.120 --> 09:41.246
Holy Christ.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.956
[Spider] Told you this was
the right place.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.207
[Doc] Scares me shitless.

09:46.794 --> 09:50.672
- Tell him that's a nice decoration.
- Watch it.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.216
Cool it, man.
Forget about that man's old lady.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.719
Give me a break, man.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.988
- Victor's got the best.
- The best.

10:15.156 --> 10:19.117
You Comacho dudes are too much.
I can't believe you guys.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.203
- [Doc continues, indistinct]
- [speaking Spanish]

10:22.371 --> 10:25.582
This really looks all right.
I feel some rocks up in here.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.501
- Gonna make a lot of people very happy.
- [Spider] Damn right it's good.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.967
By the numbers.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.388
I know they got a good reputation.
I'm just doing this because...

10:40.556 --> 10:42.182
my people expect me to do this.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.434
I'm not trying to insult the guy.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.523
[Spider] He said you got
diarrhea of the mouth, baby.

10:50.691 --> 10:54.444
Tell him that's too bad.
I thought he had more class than that.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.030
That's the color I need.
Let's go.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.615
[Spider] How's that?

11:01.744 --> 11:03.828
Everybody, get ready.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.415
[children shouting]

11:13.798 --> 11:16.966
[man] Right field is clear
if those painters are out of the way.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.301
What are you talking about?

11:18.469 --> 11:21.096
A crew of painters
went into the building next door.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.683
- They're gonna wreck that building.
- Call them in.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.310
- [rock music]
- Let's move! Move!

11:37.029 --> 11:40.073
Like I told you, Vic,
you can always depend on the Spider.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.533
Go!

11:48.958 --> 11:51.167
[gunfire continues]

12:17.528 --> 12:19.738
Get the door, Cragie.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.324
- [children screaming]
- [man shouting]

12:23.492 --> 12:25.493
Move it!

12:26.287 --> 12:29.330
The plank! Let's go! Out!

12:38.382 --> 12:39.549
Sh.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.389
In the bag!

12:50.519 --> 12:52.604
Get it in there!
Get the girl!

12:52.772 --> 12:55.857
Let's get going! Come on!

13:00.696 --> 13:02.530
[gunshot]

13:06.911 --> 13:08.703
[overlapping chatter]

13:27.598 --> 13:30.225
[man] Forget him!
We're out of here!

13:38.943 --> 13:42.403
- [man 2] Got one in the hallway!
- [man 3] Up against the wall. Let's go.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.365
They're going out the front!

14:00.339 --> 14:02.590
Come on! Come on!

14:12.852 --> 14:15.770
- Shit!
- Just get in here!

14:17.398 --> 14:19.566
- [tires screeching]
- Go, go, go!

14:19.733 --> 14:21.484
[sirens blaring]

14:27.616 --> 14:30.034
Motherfucking son of a bitch!

14:30.202 --> 14:32.120
Damn it! [groans]

14:32.288 --> 14:33.580
[tires squeal]

14:36.834 --> 14:38.960
[indistinct shouting]

14:43.632 --> 14:45.508
[woman speaking Spanish]

14:45.676 --> 14:48.261
[women screaming]

14:51.432 --> 14:52.932
[women sobbing]

14:53.100 --> 14:55.268
Cragie! Cragie?

14:55.436 --> 14:58.479
It's okay. I got the son of a bitch.
Cover the stairs.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.456
[baby crying]

15:22.796 --> 15:24.339
Jesus.

15:26.592 --> 15:30.094
[man] Citywide units,
we have an officer shot.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.221
Request for additional ambulances.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.058
Several gunshot victims.
Use caution.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.769
There are plainclothes units
on the scene. Zone-free radio.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.687
- Damn.
- [indistinct chattering]

15:44.652 --> 15:46.402
[Cragie] I told you to stay in there.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.449
- Take it easy, Kopalas.
- Sarge--

15:51.617 --> 15:53.409
The kid didn't dust him.

15:53.577 --> 15:57.622
I did. Him or me, Sarge.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.628
The kid saw the whole thing.
Tell him, Nick.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.386
Yeah, that's what happened.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.554
[woman continues sobbing]

16:16.433 --> 16:18.518
Stay here, Cragie.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.405
[chattering, shouting]

16:32.449 --> 16:33.533
Keep this clear.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.251
[man] Did you Miranda that guy?

16:45.004 --> 16:49.132
Come on, don't do that.
Do you know how much these things cost?

16:50.426 --> 16:52.468
Eddie, listen to this.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.303
A bait shop.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.264
We get some worms, some minnows.

16:56.432 --> 17:00.935
We don't even have to get real worms.
We'll get those rubber ones.

17:11.946 --> 17:15.450
You goddamn Dr. Jekyl!
He's a butcher.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.039
[siren blares]

17:24.960 --> 17:28.337
[man 1] You know, Sarge, I don't think
these guys know who their friends are.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.714
[man 2] I'm tired of this shit.

17:31.341 --> 17:36.137
Efren, what's gonna happen to you
when Luis comes up from Bogota, huh?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.805
I'll tell you what will happen.

17:37.973 --> 17:41.976
Your asses will be freeze-dried
and fried. Your goose is cooked.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.063
You must know who did it!
Who'd you fuck over lately?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.564
- Luis ain't gonna like it--
- [speaking Spanish]

17:46.732 --> 17:48.858
You want a tune-up, fuckface?

17:50.486 --> 17:53.696
Sarge, you know why a Comacho
is like a cue ball?

17:53.864 --> 17:58.785
The harder you hit them, the better
the English gets. You want to play pool?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.456
Save it, Brennan.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.504
Book them.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.384
Come on, talk to me.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.013
[whispering] What do you know?

18:22.351 --> 18:23.601
[speaking Italian]

18:26.772 --> 18:28.606
- What about Vito and Eenie?
- [girl] Keep your eyes closed.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.442
- Come on.
- [laughs]

18:31.610 --> 18:32.735
Come on.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.446
- [man] Yeah. All right.
- Ready?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.365
Now open.

18:38.826 --> 18:39.826
Oh!

18:39.993 --> 18:43.371
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- I'm so glad you're here.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.706
- Happy birthday, Molly.
- Molly.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.087
Molly, come here. Come on.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.718
Pack me a bag for the lake.
Come on, I'm in a hurry!

18:57.886 --> 19:00.388
- But why?
- Business.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.057
Move. Do what I tell you.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.685
[girl] Papa.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.694
- Don't do it, Mama.
- Hey, none of your lip today!

19:21.994 --> 19:23.536
I cannot believe you.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.954
Nothing's changed.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.790
Today is Mom's birthday.
She deserves better than this,

19:27.958 --> 19:29.750
- and so do we.
- [line busy]

19:35.048 --> 19:38.885
Tony, sorry I'm late.
Got stuck in traffic.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.595
Picked up something nice.

19:40.762 --> 19:45.099
Fucking Victor Comacho's alive.
Vito and Eenie are dead.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.476
[man] Jesus Christ.
You pulled that hit?

19:47.644 --> 19:50.354
- [woman] Don't go, Diana.
- I can't stay here, Grandma.

19:50.522 --> 19:54.192
You put somebody on the house,
and you look after her.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.069
You gone fucking crazy?
You're starting a war.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.529
You're putting the whole outfit
on the line.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.948
They're probably out looking
to start your uncle right now.

20:01.116 --> 20:04.911
Keep your mouth shut! What Mr. Scalese
don't know, won't hurt him!

20:10.334 --> 20:12.126
Happy birthday.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.881
[door opens, closes]

20:18.800 --> 20:22.386
Cragie, you're assigned to headquarters
until the hearing.

20:22.554 --> 20:26.390
Hearing?
Who called for a hearing?

20:26.558 --> 20:29.936
That goddamn little punk tried
to shoot me in the back!

20:32.814 --> 20:33.940
Sit down.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.864
- [man] Lucy Partida.
- That Commie piece of shit?

20:42.032 --> 20:47.703
Shut up! Partida demanded
a formal hearing. You'll be under oath.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.998
The department will provide you
with a lawyer unless you got one.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.335
A Citizens Review Board member
is waiting to talk to you.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.004
Doesn't sound like
you've got anything to worry about.

20:57.839 --> 21:01.592
Kopalas, you work with Cusack
until this is over.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.302
Yes, sir.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.972
All right, that will be all.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.018
Thank you, sir.

21:16.858 --> 21:20.444
- Where did they take Dorato?
- County. He'll be okay.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.865
Listen, I don't have time
to nursemaid a rookie.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.701
- I don't need a partner.
- That's right.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.829
You don't need a partner.
You need a goddamn keeper!

21:29.997 --> 21:33.582
Jesus Christ, how do I explain
this one downtown?

21:33.750 --> 21:36.168
We gave you 600 man-hours.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.672
You took a month to plan the thing,
and what do you have to show for it?

21:39.840 --> 21:45.094
Eight bodies, one dead informant,
one of my best men shot!

21:45.262 --> 21:49.015
You'll have me back on the beat,
busting perverts in the park.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.642
We've got a bigger problem.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.603
This Luis Comacho is crazy.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.314
He won't take this lying down.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.899
That's all I need:
a goddamn war.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.235
What about this business
with Cragie?

22:02.070 --> 22:04.071
You know what I think of Cragie.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.991
All right,
I'll deal with downtown.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.661
You find out who burned
the Comachos before they do.

22:12.372 --> 22:13.748
Kates.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.000
Eddie, you had a good setup.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.918
Too bad it went to hell.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.588
Yeah.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.720
[man speaking Spanish]

22:29.139 --> 22:32.767
Luis, the war does no good
for any of us.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.812
It can only make what's bad
worse.

22:36.980 --> 22:41.317
Get them out of here,
and fix them up.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.820
I want them beautiful
for their mother.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.283
[woman on PA, indistinct]

22:49.451 --> 22:52.578
My brothers,
I promise you blood for blood.

23:03.298 --> 23:05.716
[man, indistinct]

23:12.557 --> 23:13.557
How you doing, Sarge?

23:15.310 --> 23:17.144
[woman] I really appreciate your help.

23:17.312 --> 23:20.064
[man] It's quite all right.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.316
[woman] It's so overwhelming.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.569
[man speaking Spanish]

23:25.737 --> 23:28.447
[Luis] Hey, I'd like to talk to you.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.376
One day I would like
to give you a gift...

23:40.544 --> 23:42.378
of a Colombian necktie.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.963
[men snickering]

23:44.131 --> 23:45.589
Very special.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.175
You slit the throat,
pull out the tongue.

23:48.343 --> 23:53.347
And on you,
it would look beautiful.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.516
Why don't you give it to me
right now?

23:57.018 --> 23:58.853
Come. We're running late.

24:04.109 --> 24:08.404
[man] Eddie, you better grow eyes
in the back of your head.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.573
Come on! Good shot again.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.658
That's it.
Keep going. Keep it up.

24:13.201 --> 24:16.203
- Come on. Good combination.
- [grunting]

24:16.371 --> 24:17.913
Come on, Eddie.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.373
Look out.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.460
Come on. Again.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.378
He's running.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.922
- Shit! Ah, man.
- You okay?

24:28.341 --> 24:33.345
Out of my way, you side of beef.
Hey, partner.

24:35.348 --> 24:36.891
I'm all right, man.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.438
- How's the foot?
- [Dorato] Swinging. Listen to this.

24:42.606 --> 24:46.317
Two g's, we open up a beef
and sausage stand outside Wrigley Field.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.028
You dish out the beef.
I take in the cash.

24:49.196 --> 24:52.740
Free games.
I have a contact downtown.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.659
How can we watch the games
if we're hawking hot dogs?

24:58.914 --> 25:00.247
I never thought of that.

25:00.415 --> 25:03.792
Davis, I want
to have a word with you, man.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.546
Amano, when you're through playing
with that, I want to talk to you.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.716
Joey, I want you to
help me get some signatures

25:10.884 --> 25:13.219
- on this petition for Cragie.
- [Joey] Yeah, no problem.

25:13.386 --> 25:16.180
[Brennan] I figured
on the 14th at lunchtime.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.473
[Joey] Sure.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.771
Beautiful.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.691
Gus, put that thing down
and sit up for a minute.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.404
I want you to sign this.
It's for Cragie. All right?

25:32.572 --> 25:34.823
[Kates on PA]
Attention all senior personnel.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.743
There will be a demonstration
of the Prowler tactical assist robot...

25:37.911 --> 25:39.995
at 1600 hours.

25:40.163 --> 25:43.374
- Your attendance is required.
- Good shot, Eddie.

25:43.542 --> 25:48.295
Cusack, how about taking the gloves off
long enough to sign this for Cragie?

25:48.463 --> 25:50.548
- Is it about the hearing?
- [Brennan] You bet.

25:52.133 --> 25:55.135
- I pass.
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

25:57.180 --> 25:59.473
He's burned out, Brennan.
You know it.

25:59.641 --> 26:03.644
Get off your high horse.
He made a couple mistakes.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.020
The man was a hero.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.147
What do a bunch of civilians know...

26:07.315 --> 26:09.942
about coming up some shithouse staircase
scared out of your shorts?

26:14.030 --> 26:16.365
They only know
we're supposed to protect them.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.077
If Cragie doesn't get off the streets,
he'll kill somebody else...

26:20.245 --> 26:21.870
or he'll get somebody killed.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.914
Maybe even you, Brennan.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.877
Thanks a lot, Sarge.
You're a real prince.

26:29.045 --> 26:31.088
[man] Here we go.
Come on, good shot.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.548
Come on, one more time,
Eddie.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.926
[woman's voice] The Prowler's
standard weapons complement...

26:36.094 --> 26:39.013
includes one recoilless rifle...

26:39.180 --> 26:41.348
two Mark-19 grenade launchers...

26:41.516 --> 26:44.685
and twin 50-caliber machine guns.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.187
I have sufficient firepower
to neutralize...

26:47.355 --> 26:50.024
a wide variety
of security threats.

26:50.191 --> 26:54.612
As you can see, this lightweight
handheld control unit enables you...

26:54.779 --> 26:56.405
to direct my movements...

26:56.573 --> 26:59.867
while simultaneously operating
the various weapons systems...

27:00.035 --> 27:03.203
in manual or full-automatic mode.

27:03.371 --> 27:08.250
In full-automatic mode, my infrared
heat sensors and Doppler radar...

27:08.418 --> 27:11.086
mean that I am able to acquire
moving targets at night...

27:11.254 --> 27:13.797
without assistance
from the operator.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.508
That concludes
the program demonstration.

27:16.676 --> 27:20.471
Now our factory representative
will discuss the features...

27:20.639 --> 27:24.183
of the simplified Mark-2
handheld control system.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.226
After the gyros are locked...

27:26.394 --> 27:30.439
any movement of the hand controller
is duplicated by the Prowler.

27:30.607 --> 27:35.444
The simple control system means even
semiskilled employees can operate--

27:35.612 --> 27:38.656
He's talking about you, Cusack,
so pay attention.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.909
You've all got to qualify on this.
It's the future.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.787
As they say,
even a child can operate it.

27:44.954 --> 27:49.875
You're looking at the perfect cop.
The damn thing follows orders.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.836
Another gun without a brain.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.799
[man] The machine guns can be linked to
the laser range and guidance system...

27:56.966 --> 27:59.009
for target orientation.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.804
If the commander would like
to pick someone to elude Prowler...

28:01.971 --> 28:05.182
I'll show you
our target acquisition system.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.060
[Prowler] Halt. Police.
Throw down your weapon.

28:08.228 --> 28:12.272
We will not harm you. Please place
your hands above your head.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.109
- Drop it.
- You are under arrest.

28:15.276 --> 28:18.529
Please do not resist.
Thank you for your cooperation.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.198
[men laughing]

28:32.210 --> 28:34.628
[radio chatter]

28:43.763 --> 28:46.473
Eenie Verona
is the gentleman's name.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.143
Looks like you did
a hell of a job on him.

28:49.310 --> 28:52.646
- Know him?
- Yeah, he's just a punk thief.

28:52.814 --> 28:56.859
- Looks like he graduated.
- He sure flunked house painting.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.652
He had an uncle.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.656
Served time together.
What the hell's his name?

29:03.241 --> 29:05.492
- Gagleoni?
- Gamiani.

29:05.660 --> 29:08.912
[Eddie] Gamiani. I think we should
get to know him better.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.331
[mid-tempo music]

30:11.559 --> 30:15.395
[chuckles] This Gamiani
is a real swinger, huh?

30:19.067 --> 30:21.652
- Good-bye.
- Take it easy, baby.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.445
I'll be back real quick.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.280
Here we go.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.075
[mid-tempo music]

31:10.994 --> 31:13.120
[girl] He's the most active one.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.873
He's got great eyes, doesn't he?

31:16.040 --> 31:18.333
- What about the lion over there?
- Yeah.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.462
Look at that one
standing up by the cage.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.715
He's trying to figure out
what we're doing.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.133
- [all laugh]
- Yeah.

31:27.969 --> 31:31.013
His pretty white breast.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.015
Isn't that pretty?
Is that a leopard?

31:33.182 --> 31:36.810
[indistinct chattering]

31:46.154 --> 31:48.155
- I'll be back in a second, okay?
- Okay.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.741
Kind of young for that old guy,
don't you think?

31:50.909 --> 31:54.161
What's going on?
Eddie, this isn't panning out.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.289
Why don't you watch, kid?
Learn something.

32:01.377 --> 32:05.172
- What are you doing here?
- Your papa worries.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.925
Get out of here, Lou,
and leave me alone.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.637
Come on.
Let's go see the ducks.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.472
[girl] I don't want to see the ducks.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.182
[Diana] What's wrong with ducks?

32:50.718 --> 32:52.260
Yeah, come on.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.513
- [woman] Hey!
- Hi!

32:54.681 --> 32:56.014
Hey, guys!

33:03.231 --> 33:05.399
[woman] Diana, thanks again!

34:37.574 --> 34:41.328
- [Nick laughing]
- [Eddie] What's so funny?

34:42.663 --> 34:44.164
Enough already.

34:44.331 --> 34:47.626
We're following them,
they're following her...

34:48.585 --> 34:50.504
and nobody knows nothing.

34:50.670 --> 34:51.797
- [women chattering]
- [Diana] Come on.

34:51.964 --> 34:54.007
Let's find out something.

34:55.009 --> 34:56.217
Stay here.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.353
- [soft music]
- [indistinct chatter]

35:14.779 --> 35:16.822
God.

35:32.338 --> 35:33.964
- How are you?
- Congratulations.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.717
I'm glad you made it.
Excuse me, this is Mrs. Wilson.

35:37.885 --> 35:41.096
- This is my friend, Diana.
- Nice to meet you.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.598
- This must be a lucky break then.
- [man] It is.

35:43.766 --> 35:46.518
I just sold my first piece
to Mrs. Wilson here.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.354
Terrific.
I like your new stuff.

35:49.522 --> 35:52.274
Especially the dead dog series.
When did you do that? It's great.

35:52.441 --> 35:55.110
[overlapping chatter]

35:55.278 --> 35:57.571
Hello. Would you like
some hors d'oeuvres?

36:00.158 --> 36:02.325
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks for stopping by.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.703
I'll see you downstairs later.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.913
He is really a character.

36:07.081 --> 36:09.416
She's a great girl.
I'd love to help.

36:09.584 --> 36:12.294
We should set up a date,
and I'll help you hang it.

36:12.461 --> 36:14.588
I'd be delighted.

36:16.883 --> 36:17.716
Excuse me.

36:17.884 --> 36:21.052
Who was that girl you were talking to
in the black slacks?

36:21.220 --> 36:23.430
- I think I know her.
- Diana Luna.

36:46.787 --> 36:50.123
- You understand it?
- Sure. Don't you?

36:50.958 --> 36:52.667
Mm-mm.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.921
I'm Eddie Cusack.

36:59.383 --> 37:03.303
- I'd make it Eddie the cop.
- That obvious, huh?

37:04.764 --> 37:05.889
[scoffs]

37:06.057 --> 37:10.477
Listen, I don't know where my father is,
and I don't give a damn.

37:10.645 --> 37:14.439
I have nothing to do
with my father's business...

37:14.607 --> 37:16.733
Uncle Scalese's business
or any of it.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.985
So why don't you leave me alone?

37:24.659 --> 37:26.243
It was nice meeting you.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.329
[excited chattering]

37:29.997 --> 37:31.748
I thought I was feeling good,
but--

37:31.916 --> 37:35.001
Happy? Whoo!

37:35.169 --> 37:36.628
You bet!

37:38.464 --> 37:40.715
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah. Right over there.

37:42.134 --> 37:44.844
[laughs loudly] Whoo!

37:47.515 --> 37:49.933
[coughing] Whoo!

37:50.685 --> 37:53.561
Kobas, this is Sergeant Cusack.

37:53.729 --> 37:56.690
I want a team to cover a house
on the southwest side.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.401
Luna. L-u-n-a. Anthony.

37:59.568 --> 38:02.237
Yeah, Crazy Tony Luna.

38:02.405 --> 38:05.699
I don't know if he's around,
but if he shows up bring him in.

38:05.866 --> 38:06.908
Thanks.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.417
Catch you later.

38:18.045 --> 38:20.297
That's a very nice choice.

38:20.881 --> 38:23.174
[mid-tempo music]

38:41.402 --> 38:42.861
Oh, yeah.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.656
Hey, you comfortable?

38:47.074 --> 38:48.908
They're wasting the show.

38:50.411 --> 38:54.914
- Tony's not even in town.
- They'll get the word.

38:55.082 --> 38:58.918
[woman] Mrs. Luna,
come away from the window.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.946
- How about yourself?
- Don't worry about me.

39:28.115 --> 39:30.867
- I'll take care of him.
- Take care.

39:37.666 --> 39:38.875
Wait here.

39:41.837 --> 39:44.798
- I can back you up.
- Stay by the radio.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.345
- [man] Felix, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:01.315 --> 40:04.150
Get me yesterday's numbers
on Phoenix, huh?

40:13.035 --> 40:14.536
What are you doing here?

40:17.832 --> 40:19.249
Off, asshole.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.667
[grunts, screams]

40:27.049 --> 40:28.842
Cusack.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.805
[computer beeps]

40:33.973 --> 40:36.850
The modern age's answer
to the crystal ball.

40:37.017 --> 40:40.145
Marvelous,
if you know how to read it.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.857
If you've got some extra cash,
buy oranges.

40:44.024 --> 40:48.403
The price is low, and I can promise you
there will be a trucking strike.

40:48.571 --> 40:49.946
Is that a bribe, Mr. Scalese?

40:51.073 --> 40:52.866
It's a prediction.

40:53.033 --> 40:54.200
Nah.

40:54.368 --> 40:56.494
I wouldn't try
to bribe Eddie Cusack.

40:57.329 --> 41:00.457
They tell me you're incorruptible,
untarnished.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.710
I hear they call you Stainless Steel
on the street.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.880
Me? I think you're
a pain in the ass.

41:08.424 --> 41:09.799
I'm looking for one
of your nephews.

41:14.054 --> 41:15.597
Tony Luna.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.682
Good-bye, Mr. Cusack.

41:17.850 --> 41:21.060
There's a shitstorm coming, old man,
and you can stop it.

41:21.228 --> 41:23.396
Good-bye, Mr. Cusack.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.569
- Nobody talks, right?
- That's right, Sergeant.

41:29.737 --> 41:33.656
Just like the cops.
Just like the Comachos.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.909
Nobody talks.

41:36.535 --> 41:39.162
- [speaks Italian]
- [car horn honking]

41:45.002 --> 41:47.253
[honking horn]

41:50.341 --> 41:52.008
I'll find Tony Luna...

41:52.176 --> 41:56.763
and I'll nail his ass
and anyone else connected to him.

41:56.931 --> 42:00.141
- You got that?
- You punk!

42:00.309 --> 42:02.143
Nobody threatens me.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.103
It's not a threat.

42:05.814 --> 42:06.940
Ohh!

42:09.610 --> 42:11.236
It's a prediction.

42:16.742 --> 42:21.412
[man] Roger, Homicide.
We're at Lincoln Park Conservatory.

42:21.580 --> 42:24.457
Victim is a male Caucasian.
Multiple knife wounds.

42:24.625 --> 42:27.710
Coroner's on the scene.
Request for laboratory backup.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.463
- [sirens approaching]
- [crowd chattering]

42:39.139 --> 42:41.057
Tony Luna's bagman.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.895
They call that a Colombian necktie.

42:46.897 --> 42:50.358
They found Tony's restaurant manager
hanging from a meat hook in the kitchen.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.694
Looked like someone tried
to carve a canoe out of him.

42:52.861 --> 42:56.155
Tony's used car lot on Ashland
is burning as we speak.

42:56.323 --> 42:59.993
- Head salesman is fried zucchini.
- [Nick] Jesus.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.120
It's starting.

43:02.288 --> 43:04.664
- [mid-tempo music]
- Let's go.

43:22.099 --> 43:24.601
- [woman] Good morning, Mrs. Luna.
- Good morning.

43:25.519 --> 43:28.354
Don't the eggplants
look wonderful?

43:44.538 --> 43:46.539
[gunfire]

44:01.013 --> 44:03.222
- [tires screech]
- [men shouting in Spanish]

44:16.070 --> 44:17.362
[man on radio] They're all over
the place;

44:17.529 --> 44:19.155
in the house and out in the street.

44:19.323 --> 44:20.573
Looks like a war zone.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.867
- [man 2] How many victims, 10-21?
- Five so far.

44:23.035 --> 44:25.495
Four adult females, one adult male;
all Caucasian.

44:25.663 --> 44:30.458
This is Cusack. Was there a girl,
late teens, brownish hair?

44:30.626 --> 44:33.503
[man 1] Negative. We got four adult
females pretty chewed up.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.546
The youngest looks about 40.

44:35.714 --> 44:37.882
What kind of people
are these guys?

44:38.926 --> 44:41.386
[siren blares]

44:48.769 --> 44:50.395
What's it about?

44:50.562 --> 44:52.355
I'm not going.
I don't have to go.

44:52.523 --> 44:56.025
Your mother got killed.
Take it easy.

44:56.193 --> 44:58.236
Just put your jacket on.

44:59.697 --> 45:00.947
Let's get out of here.

45:01.115 --> 45:03.574
[woman on radio, indistinct]

45:09.456 --> 45:10.790
Stick with me.

45:18.048 --> 45:20.842
[mid-tempo music]

46:04.928 --> 46:08.681
[groans] Run.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.283
Stay here.

46:32.664 --> 46:33.956
[scoffs]

47:31.849 --> 47:32.682
Cut the chica.

47:32.850 --> 47:33.933
Angel!

47:35.143 --> 47:36.602
Let her go.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.565
Take out your weapons.

47:40.732 --> 47:42.525
Left hand.

47:45.487 --> 47:48.114
Up against the wall.
Move it!

47:50.200 --> 47:51.993
You heard me, Angel.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.203
Diana, come here.

47:56.748 --> 48:00.543
- Back!
- [man shouts in Spanish]

48:02.170 --> 48:03.087
Let her go.

48:13.807 --> 48:15.308
Eddie!

48:27.362 --> 48:28.487
Come on!

49:05.692 --> 49:07.652
[man on P.A., indistinct]

49:07.819 --> 49:09.528
[music continues]

49:32.427 --> 49:33.844
Wait.

49:35.430 --> 49:36.681
Whoa.

49:42.062 --> 49:43.854
- [people screaming]
- [Eddie] Angel!

49:50.362 --> 49:53.030
One more step,
I'll cut her head off!

49:54.449 --> 49:55.533
Give it up.

49:56.576 --> 49:58.369
[music resumes]

50:56.470 --> 50:57.803
[Angel grunts]

51:25.040 --> 51:26.540
Get your ass up.

51:30.545 --> 51:31.212
Shit!

51:43.225 --> 51:45.226
No! No!

51:47.479 --> 51:48.979
[sirens approaching]

52:28.145 --> 52:30.563
[music resumes]

53:21.448 --> 53:22.865
Is it true?

53:27.204 --> 53:28.787
Yeah.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.628
[sobbing]

53:55.857 --> 53:58.067
- [woman on radio, indistinct]
- [knocking at door]

53:58.235 --> 54:01.487
Keep your goddamn pants on.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.993
Eddie, what the hell is going on?
Come on in.

54:09.496 --> 54:11.163
[dog barking]

54:15.543 --> 54:18.212
Fred Pirelli, Diana Luna.

54:18.380 --> 54:19.463
[whistles]

54:19.631 --> 54:21.340
Hi, kid.

54:24.010 --> 54:27.179
She won't go into protective custody,
and I couldn't leave her alone.

54:30.892 --> 54:32.768
I hate putting you on the spot
like this.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.188
I spent 30 years "on the spot."

54:37.274 --> 54:39.149
Can you put her up
until I find her old man?

54:40.402 --> 54:42.069
Whatever you need.

54:43.613 --> 54:46.865
[Dorato] Brennan, I heard you're
gonna retire when you sober up.

54:47.033 --> 54:49.535
In that case, I'll never retire.

54:49.703 --> 54:53.038
Dorato, you only have to buy one boot.
You're getting off cheap.

54:53.206 --> 54:55.082
[Dorato] Are you serious?
I'm sick about it.

54:55.250 --> 54:58.294
These boots were handmade in Italy.
They cost me 17.50...

54:58.461 --> 55:00.129
- with the police discount.
- [Cragie laughs]

55:00.297 --> 55:03.590
Hey, Eddie.
Yeah, it's me.

55:03.758 --> 55:05.092
Yeah.

55:05.260 --> 55:08.345
Why don't you come by
and tip a few?

55:09.931 --> 55:11.181
Come on. Come on.

55:11.349 --> 55:13.892
Have a few beers with me.
It will do you good.

55:14.060 --> 55:15.978
- [blues music playing]
- Aw, come--

55:16.146 --> 55:18.188
Do I know--?
I know it's late.

55:20.817 --> 55:22.901
Hey, Eddie,

55:23.069 --> 55:24.820
I have to talk to you.

55:24.988 --> 55:27.072
[indistinct chattering]

55:30.952 --> 55:32.745
Yeah, at Mike's.

55:33.580 --> 55:35.956
All right, great.
Thanks, pal.

55:39.377 --> 55:41.628
[breathing heavily]

55:47.469 --> 55:48.969
What the fuck
are you doing?

55:49.929 --> 55:52.723
Try and relax, Flash.

55:52.891 --> 55:55.768
This will be a slide, man.
Easy in, easy out.

55:55.935 --> 55:57.436
Piece of cake, man.
Nothing to it.

55:57.604 --> 56:01.190
German fucking chocolate.
You got it.

56:01.358 --> 56:03.275
- Sure you checked it out?
- Trust me.

56:03.443 --> 56:05.944
- Are you sure?
- You know the drill.

56:06.112 --> 56:08.364
- I go to the back, you go to the bar.
- Right.

56:08.531 --> 56:11.075
You order a drink.
What will you order?

56:11.242 --> 56:14.453
- What's the difference?
- You have to know what you're ordering.

56:14.621 --> 56:16.121
You're making me nervous.

56:16.289 --> 56:18.791
- Relax. Have a toothpick.
- Fuck a toothpick.

56:18.958 --> 56:20.751
Let's go get some money.

56:33.556 --> 56:34.556
[both grunt]

56:34.724 --> 56:36.350
[chattering continues]

56:36.518 --> 56:37.976
You ought to crash, babe.

56:38.144 --> 56:39.895
You had a heck of a day.

56:40.730 --> 56:43.357
- How you doing?
- [Dorato] How are you?

56:46.319 --> 56:48.487
Hurry up. I got a lot of women
who want to sign it.

56:48.655 --> 56:51.323
- It's a piece of art.
- It's a piece of shit.

56:51.491 --> 56:53.158
- Just don't become a ballerina.
- Yeah.

56:53.326 --> 56:56.161
- [door buzzes]
- [blues music continues]

57:12.637 --> 57:13.929
What's up?

57:18.268 --> 57:19.726
[door buzzes]

57:23.606 --> 57:25.274
- How you doing?
- Open house tonight.

57:25.442 --> 57:29.486
Give me a Black Russian
and a Courvoisier.

57:30.738 --> 57:32.072
Straight up.

57:37.036 --> 57:39.371
Where's all the dancing girls,
shaving their legs?

57:52.135 --> 57:56.013
All right, get your hands up,
motherfuckers!

57:56.181 --> 57:59.057
[Dorato] Which of you two guys
is the brains of the outfit?

57:59.225 --> 58:03.187
You stupid motherfucker.
Dumb cocksucker.

58:03.354 --> 58:05.230
Bring that piece of shit over here.

58:05.398 --> 58:07.399
- Come here.
- Worm brain motherfucker!

58:09.277 --> 58:10.736
Spread them.
Kiss the bar.

58:10.904 --> 58:12.988
Old lady told me he was fucked-up
in the head. Do I listen?

58:13.156 --> 58:16.992
"Gonna be a piece of cake, man.
Nothing to it. Gonna be a slide, man."

58:17.160 --> 58:20.996
- Should have listened to my old lady.
- Screw her. Everybody else has.

58:21.164 --> 58:25.417
- Cuff them and get them out of here.
- Give me your paw.

58:25.585 --> 58:26.919
They get dumber every day.

58:28.171 --> 58:29.880
[Eddie] Just let her get some sleep.

58:30.048 --> 58:32.257
That's what I need too.

58:32.425 --> 58:35.844
- [Fred] Get some and take care.
- [Eddie] I'll call you tomorrow.

58:36.012 --> 58:37.304
[knocking on door]

58:44.145 --> 58:47.231
- Here's some tea.
- Thanks.

59:01.621 --> 59:03.205
[stammers]

59:04.999 --> 59:07.125
What do you do
if you don't have someone?

59:11.297 --> 59:13.006
You find someone.

59:16.302 --> 59:18.095
Will you hold me?

59:19.472 --> 59:22.140
- [mid-tempo music]
- [sobs]

59:27.814 --> 59:30.440
You'll be fine.

59:36.281 --> 59:37.823
I'll see you tomorrow.

59:42.745 --> 59:44.496
You're lucky my hands are cuffed.

59:44.664 --> 59:46.498
I'll kick your ass,
handcuffed or not.

59:46.666 --> 59:49.710
- You'd be black and blue.
- You can't, man.

59:49.877 --> 59:51.628
Shoot me, so I don't have to listen
to him anymore.

59:51.796 --> 59:53.630
- Hey, man--
- Shut up.

59:53.798 --> 59:57.384
- You think you're John Wayne?
- I'll make you Jane Wayne.

59:57.552 --> 01:00:01.430
- [man] Who ordered the Courvoisier?
- Hi, Sarge.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.056
Hey, Sarge.

01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:07.185
- What's this?
- These morons tried to rob us.

01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:09.771
We called the station
45 minutes ago for a wagon.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:12.316
They didn't believe us.
They thought we were kidding.

01:00:12.483 --> 01:00:14.776
Eddie, partner, come here.

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:20.157
How you doing?
I want you to meet two friends of mine.

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:23.869
This is Ruby, a dental hygienist.
Very oral.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:28.373
Marlene here works for a proctologist.
Don't turn your back on her.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:31.084
Have a drink.
I have a proposition for you.

01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:32.210
Later.

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:34.796
Let me plant two words
in your brain:

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:36.715
alligator farming.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.385
- "Alligator farming"?
- Yeah.

01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:42.095
Yeah.

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:45.057
It'll work.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:54.399
Thanks.

01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:59.112
- How's the girl?
- She's fine.

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:03.367
That fucker.
Why is he down here?

01:01:03.534 --> 01:01:05.202
- Want a beer?
- Nah.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.246
Val, give me
another Southern Comfort.

01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:14.836
I really want to be a good cop.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:18.507
Sometimes I get so scared, you know?

01:01:19.258 --> 01:01:22.260
- Only a fool doesn't get scared.
- It's so easy for you.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:25.222
You got all the answers.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:30.394
For me, I don't know.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:46.201
Cragie planted the gun
on that kid.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:51.957
He just wasted him,
blew him away...

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.836
and I went
right along with it.

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.089
My partner.

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:04.302
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about that hearing tomorrow.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.014
Tell the truth.

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:15.647
See? You make it sound so easy.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:19.609
I got a wife and a kid...

01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:22.612
and you're telling me
to commit suicide.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:26.324
How am I supposed to live with these
guys if I sell out my own partner?

01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:27.659
And if you don't?

01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:34.875
- Cragie gets away with it.
- And the chance to do it again.

01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:37.294
It was a mistake.
It was an accident.

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:41.173
- That kid was killed because of it.
- Don't you think I know it?

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:53.393
I see that boy's face
every time I close my eyes.

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:57.731
Tell it like it is, Nick.

01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:00.817
I'll back you up.

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:10.160
- See you guys later.
- [Dorato] Yeah, Eddie.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.245
[Cragie] Look what's here.

01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:15.040
Nice to see you out with the boys
for a change.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.291
Cragie.

01:03:17.084 --> 01:03:19.920
They tell me my sergeant
wouldn't sign for me.

01:03:20.087 --> 01:03:23.632
- Want to tell me why?
- You know why.

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:25.884
No, tell me.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.136
Mister, you don't belong
on the streets anymore.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:30.806
Fuck you.
Where do you get off?

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:33.308
Right about here.

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:39.564
Good night, Sarge.

01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:43.276
[Lucy] If it was dark, Officer...

01:03:43.444 --> 01:03:45.111
how were you sure Vega had a gun?

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:49.574
We got lucky. There was a glint of light
reflecting off the weapon's barrel.

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:53.954
Officer Cragie,
you have heard Mrs. Munoz's testimony.

01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:55.539
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:57.958
You heard her tell this panel
that she saw you...

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:00.043
lay the gun
in her grandson's hand.

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:02.921
I'm not saying
the woman made this up...

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:07.008
but there's no way she could see
anything from where she was standing...

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.885
in a hallway that dark.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.805
Like you said,
she's the boy's grandmother.

01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:14.266
- [sizzling sounds]
- [whistling]

01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:28.029
Young lady, you are about
to have the house specialty:

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:30.073
Eggs Pirelli.

01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:33.660
You got your protein,
carbohydrates...

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:36.705
vitamin D, vitamin C.

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:39.541
Good for you. Strength.
Eat now. [laughs]

01:04:52.346 --> 01:04:54.681
- Eat.
- [line busy]

01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:00.729
[Lucy] Right after you heard
Officer Cragie's gun discharge,

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:02.188
what did you do then?

01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:04.983
I immediately advanced
down the hall.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.651
[Lucy] What did you see?

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:09.988
The deceased, Vega...

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:11.656
lying on the floor.

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:13.909
Officer Cragie
was checking his vital signs.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:16.077
[Lucy] What happened then?

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:20.206
We recovered a .25-caliber automatic
from the teenager's right hand.

01:05:20.374 --> 01:05:24.836
Did you see that weapon in Vega's hand
before Officer Cragie fired?

01:05:27.381 --> 01:05:28.673
Yes, ma'am.

01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:31.509
[Lucy] No more questions.

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:36.765
You made that uniform look good.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.016
That guy next to me--

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:42.687
Handsome devil, huh?
That's Eddie's dad.

01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:45.440
Better than a good cop.

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:49.611
He was killed
in the line of duty, '71.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:53.531
- An accident.
- [dog barking]

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:54.866
[knocking at door]

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.650
- What do you want?
- Gas company.

01:06:31.278 --> 01:06:33.238
- [man] How you doing?
- [dog barking]

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:37.534
I can't comment on that.
It was over before I got there.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.786
[Lucy] Aren't you his superior officer?

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:42.122
Cragie's in my unit, yes.

01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:45.291
Did you request that Officer Cragie
be on your team?

01:06:45.459 --> 01:06:47.919
- I did not.
- [Lucy] Sergeant...

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:52.173
I have here a department document
dated 24 September of last year.

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:56.928
It is a request by you to have Officer
Cragie transferred to another unit.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:07:00.306
- Are you familiar with this document?
- I am.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:02.892
Why did you request this transfer?

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:10.275
Thirty years is too long for anyone to
look at the city's guts, Mrs. Partida.

01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:13.278
Are you saying Officer Cragie
is not fit...

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:15.447
to work the streets of Chicago?

01:07:18.659 --> 01:07:20.702
That's what I'm saying.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:23.413
[audience murmuring]

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:26.416
Come on, lady.
Give the guy a break.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:39.554
- Fuck me? No, fuck you.
- Why are you arguing with him?

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:43.099
He didn't want me on tactical.

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:44.934
[line busy]

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:56.154
Operator, please check 555-6610 for me.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:59.282
Seems to me the man
has his tongue stuck to his asshole.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:02.410
That don't bother him.
He's the fucking white knight.

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:06.164
[woman] Sorry, the number is out of
service. I'll report it if you want.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:09.667
You want to take on the world
by yourself?

01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:11.419
Now you'll get your chance.

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.505
[mid-tempo music]

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:41.366
We just got here, Sarge.

01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:49.957
- Wasn't he a friend of yours?
- More than a friend.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.341
- Where's the girl?
- There was nobody else.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:13.231
Squad, this is 1462.
I need backup.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:17.569
Have 64 and 63 meet me at the billiard
parlor on 18th near Halsted.

01:09:17.736 --> 01:09:19.319
Ten-four, 1462.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.573
[all chattering]

01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:26.327
- [man on radio] 1463, come in.
- [man] Brennan, chow time.

01:09:29.081 --> 01:09:33.042
1463, you've got
1462 requesting backup.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:35.545
Meet him at the pool hall,
18th and Halsted.

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:42.093
Unit 1463 here. We can't respond.
We have a drug purchase in progress.

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:45.430
You want to reassign that?

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.473
Can anybody assist
for 18th and Halsted?

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.100
Got a one-man TAC team
going into a pool hall.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:53.395
[woman] 5447, we have a call from zone
10 for a backup.

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:56.274
Tactical Sergeant 1462
needs assistance...

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:58.484
at the pool hall
at 18th and Halsted.

01:09:58.652 --> 01:10:01.279
Can you help him out?
He's a one-man unit.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:04.324
[man on radio] We got a dead dog here
blocking traffic on Washington.

01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:06.701
We're waiting
for animal control.

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:09.454
[man 2 on radio] We're tailing a
suspicious vehicle southbound on Wells.

01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:12.248
Jack, do you have a backup
for 18th and Halsted?

01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:15.168
You heard what happened.
Who the hell will back him up?

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:19.923
- You're playing fucking games.
- If you want to respond, take a cab.

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:22.342
This car ain't going no place
for that son of a bitch!

01:10:22.509 --> 01:10:26.930
[woman on radio] Zone 10, we're not
getting any help for car 62.

01:10:27.097 --> 01:10:30.225
Can somebody assist car 62?
He's alone.

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.810
- Zone 20?
- [man 3] You're breaking up here.

01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:35.313
We're going in
for a radio check.

01:10:41.278 --> 01:10:43.821
- [car horn honking]
- [man shouting]

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.452
- [loud chattering]
- [mid-tempo music]

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.168
You don't want to be in here.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:59.754
If I want your opinion,
I'll beat it out of you.

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:02.590
[grunting]

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:11.099
[grunts]

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:30.368
Where is he?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.834
I don't know what
you're talking about!

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:39.502
I want Luis, you fucking punk.

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:41.421
Get out of here.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:46.759
[groaning]

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:53.766
[groans]

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.561
Talk, asshole.

01:11:58.063 --> 01:12:00.315
He's on his way.

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:21.711
Who wants the first one? Hm?

01:12:25.382 --> 01:12:27.383
You, amigo?

01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:32.096
How about you, huh?

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:50.782
Gun, cabron.

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:14.722
Take him apart.

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:15.890
[grunts]

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:22.814

- [Eddie groans]
- [men shouting]

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:00.017
Grab his legs!

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:03.020
Grab his legs!
Grab his legs!

01:14:03.188 --> 01:14:04.856
Grab his legs.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:12.780
- [Eddie grunting]
- Victor!

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:21.205
- Victor!
- [groaning]

01:14:24.084 --> 01:14:25.501
Save him.

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:41.267
When the sun comes up,
you give me Luna...

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:43.561
or the girl dies...

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:45.855
slowly.

01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:52.904
[man speaking Spanish]

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.867
You don't understand, huh, Eddie?
I told you, man,

01:14:58.035 --> 01:15:00.578
don't fuck with the Comachos.

01:15:10.422 --> 01:15:12.298
[car horns honking]

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.016
[Dorato] Eddie?

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:24.894
Eddie?

01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:27.522
Eddie!

01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:30.733
Where the fuck is he?

01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:37.698
[arcade game beeping]

01:15:43.997 --> 01:15:45.373
Cusack?!

01:15:52.464 --> 01:15:54.006
Hey, Eddie?

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:59.303
- Jesus Christ, are you all right?
- [groans] I'll live.

01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:01.639
I'd have been here,
but those guys kept it from me.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.808
I've been talking
to my friend, Maggie...

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:06.018
who works on a computer
at the Federal building.

01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:09.105
- You're going to die.
- They have Diana Luna.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:10.314
I'm trying to tell you...

01:16:10.482 --> 01:16:13.317
she got a wire that Tony Luna's
been laying down in Wisconsin...

01:16:13.485 --> 01:16:16.779
and he's coming in town tonight
at the Union Station at 10:00.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.365
[mid-tempo music]

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.492
Hey, Eddie.

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:24.078
Hey, Eddie!

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.670

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.368
[tires squealing]

01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:15.713
Hello, Uncle Felix.

01:17:17.215 --> 01:17:19.133
You're a bad boy, Tony.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:22.887
I told you leave it alone,
but, no, you had to start this.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:25.056
You were always that way.

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:28.726
You're like a kid.
You see something, you grab it.

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:35.149
- Give it to me.
- For what?

01:17:44.576 --> 01:17:45.910
I'm only here to cooperate.

01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:51.415
There's someone with us, boss.

01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:54.794
Move it.

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:57.630
[up-tempo music]

01:18:56.523 --> 01:18:58.482
This bitch is crazy!

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.945
Get rid of him!

01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:20.045
- Don't fuck with me, old man!
- Tony, we won't hurt you!

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.768
[police sirens]

01:20:24.903 --> 01:20:28.364
You tell Luis,
I've got Tony Luna.

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:31.033
I want a time and a place.

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:36.914
Got it.

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:41.377
[police radio chatter]

01:20:58.603 --> 01:21:01.438
[man] Cusack, where are you going
with my car?

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:12.867
[Luis] Hello, my angel.

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:15.786
Have you had a nice night?

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:17.955
I have wonderful news for you.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:21.083
- Look at me.
- Look at the man, huh?

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.545
Daddy's on his way.

01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:28.382
[makes shooting sounds]
He's dead.

01:21:36.474 --> 01:21:38.851
[man talking, indistinct]

01:21:40.186 --> 01:21:43.147
Beautiful job.
Look at the way it came across.

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:46.358
Watch. It will be a screen pass
to the right.

01:21:46.526 --> 01:21:48.319
Eddie, how are you?

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:51.113
Eddie's a good guy.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:54.533
[conversation continues faintly]

01:22:14.512 --> 01:22:16.347
[man continues]
You're learning about football.

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:19.058
To learn about me,
you'll have to learn about football.

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.354
[mid-tempo music]

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:48.545
I want two guys up there.

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:52.549
- How many are up front?
- I got two up there.

01:22:52.717 --> 01:22:55.719
Make it four.
We'll be prepared for anything.

01:22:55.887 --> 01:22:57.846
I don't trust this son of a bitch.

01:22:58.014 --> 01:23:00.432
Victor, take the girl back.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:05.729
- I have a present for Luna.
- I have two guys up the middle.

01:23:05.897 --> 01:23:08.565
That's great.
Efren, come with me.

01:23:45.061 --> 01:23:49.648
[Luis] Victor, when this is over,
Luna goes back to Bogota with me.

01:23:49.816 --> 01:23:51.942
[Victor speaks Spanish]

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:11.670
[man] I don't know.

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:14.715
I was watching films with my girl,
and the next thing I know...

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:17.676
he locked the door
and took the truck.

01:24:17.844 --> 01:24:18.802
I don't know what happened.

01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:20.429
What's going on?

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:22.473
Cusack took off
with a truckload of armor.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.185
- He's a one-man army now.
- The son of a bitch is crazy.

01:24:26.352 --> 01:24:29.480
Okay, no more games.
Where's Cusack?

01:24:29.647 --> 01:24:31.482
He's saving the world.

01:24:52.295 --> 01:24:56.131
Eddie's out there alone, and you're
going to let him die? Fuck all of you.

01:24:56.299 --> 01:24:59.510
- Cool it, kid.
- "Cool it"? No.

01:24:59.677 --> 01:25:03.430
No, no, no. You fucking cool it.
I won't lie for you anymore.

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:05.891
I saw him lay a gun on that kid.
He blew him away, and I saw it.

01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:08.769
- You fucking little bastard.
- Goddamn you!

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:12.022
[all shouting]

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.691
What's this for, partner,
your next fuckup?

01:25:16.152 --> 01:25:19.780
You better be straight.
Your badge is on the line.

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:22.282
If I can't do this right,
you can have it.

01:25:24.702 --> 01:25:27.955
Get someone in the air.
We have to find Cusack.

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:59.111
- Get out there.
- [men shouting]

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.461
[on radio] This is Kates. Listen to me.

01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:19.381
We have a sergeant in a green truck.

01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:21.758
We're looking for him.
Who do you have in the air?

01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:24.261
[woman] City wide--

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:38.817
[explosion]

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:15.646

01:27:22.987 --> 01:27:24.863

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:35.958
Get the girl!

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:39.002

- Hold on! Ahh!

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:23.046
Ahh!

01:29:05.965 --> 01:29:08.050
[all shouting]

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.809
[both screaming]

01:30:03.439 --> 01:30:05.774
[Prowler] This concludes
our demonstration.

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:07.317
If you have further questions...

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:10.529
our factory representative
will be happy to answer them.

01:30:18.037 --> 01:30:19.996
[man shouts in Spanish]

01:31:13.384 --> 01:31:16.094
Get up, you son of a bitch!
Get the fuck up!

01:31:31.444 --> 01:31:33.862
[Efren] Come on, Eddie!
We told you we'd get you!

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:40.368
Come on, asshole!

01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:43.163
[Efren] We got him, Pompas!

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:44.915
Come out, you chickenshit!

01:31:54.133 --> 01:31:55.091
Ahh!

01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:06.728
Come out, you bastard!

01:32:06.896 --> 01:32:10.357
Come on, Luis, we got him! Pompas!

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:11.691
Efren!

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:14.736
Ahh!

01:32:34.674 --> 01:32:36.758
[mid-tempo music]

01:33:04.203 --> 01:33:06.997
Cusack!
You just killed that girl!

01:33:19.176 --> 01:33:20.844

01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:34.357

- [mid-tempo music]
- [car doors close]

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.294
You know where to find me.

01:35:35.855 --> 01:35:37.063
[Dorato] Hey, Eddie.

01:35:38.691 --> 01:35:41.693
Partner, I got a great idea.

01:35:42.486 --> 01:35:44.612
Mail-order Christmas trees.

01:35:45.656 --> 01:35:47.365
Think about it.

01:35:51.662 --> 01:35:53.413
See you tomorrow?

01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:05.091
