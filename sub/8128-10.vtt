     Oh, Ma, that's one of the

00:56.556 --> 00:57.989
                 I've ever seen.

00:57.991 --> 01:03.461
Yeah. I hope the reverend don't 
wet it when he names the baby.  

01:03.463 --> 01:08.033
I remember when Cousin Emily was
baptized. Her dress was ruined! 

01:08.035 --> 01:10.368
            Gee. How could      
      a little sprinkle do that?

01:10.370 --> 01:14.305
Well, in Cousin Emily's case, it
wasn't the reverend who did it. 

01:14.307 --> 01:16.507
It was Cousin Emily.            

01:17.810 --> 01:19.310

01:19.312 --> 01:20.845
                    What for?   
  You lost the bet.             

01:20.847 --> 01:22.681
     You made the bet           
  and you lost the bet--        

01:22.683 --> 01:24.415
GLORIA:                         
Hey! What's the matter?         

01:24.417 --> 01:26.217
The matter is, your husband     
    ain't got no honor.         

01:26.219 --> 01:27.552
You know that?                  
He's a welsher.                 

01:27.554 --> 01:29.954
He made me a bet of a dollar,   
      he lost the bet,          

01:29.956 --> 01:31.156
    and now                     
he won't pay up.                

01:31.158 --> 01:33.391
You know that joke              
was funny!                      

01:33.393 --> 01:35.160
                  Arch, the joke
                  was not funny!

01:35.162 --> 01:36.594
            You didn't see me   
                laugh, did you? 

01:36.596 --> 01:40.865
I seen you                      
trying not to laugh.            

01:40.867 --> 01:44.335
But you didn't fool me, because 
I seen your mustache twitching. 

01:45.504 --> 01:47.405
What is this                    
all about?                      

01:47.407 --> 01:48.472
I bet him a dollar              

01:48.474 --> 01:49.874
that if he could hear           
 Stretch Cunningham             

01:49.876 --> 01:52.543
tell one of his own jokes       
    in his own voice,           

01:52.545 --> 01:54.879
 that he had to laugh,          
he'd think it was funny.        

01:54.881 --> 01:56.748
            Can you believe     
    he actually tape-recorded   

01:56.750 --> 01:58.416
            Stretch telling one 
          of those rotten jokes!

01:58.418 --> 01:59.884
That's right.                   
 Right here.                    

01:59.886 --> 02:02.453
          Hey! Daddy,           
    did you buy that?           

02:02.455 --> 02:04.555
No, no, Stretch                 
loaned it to me.                

02:04.557 --> 02:09.094
  He uses it to try out         
his jokes on himself, see?      

02:10.362 --> 02:12.330
      Now, listen               
        to this.                

02:12.332 --> 02:14.165
            No, I don't want    
        to listen to that again.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.466
                It stinks, Arch.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.801
            Just wrap up        
         the sandwiches, Gloria.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.002
                Let's get going.

02:18.004 --> 02:19.570
         Wait a minute.         
         Wait a minute!         

02:19.572 --> 02:21.840
Pay me the buck before          
you go on your vacation.        

02:21.842 --> 02:22.974
                             No!
                 Daddy.         

02:22.976 --> 02:24.242
It's not a vacation.            

02:24.244 --> 02:25.643
It's a weekend seminar          
  in the mountains.             

02:25.645 --> 02:28.012
It's a sociology study group.   

02:28.014 --> 02:29.948
It's a working weekend          
     for Michael.               

02:29.950 --> 02:31.315
      "A working weekend,"      

02:31.317 --> 02:33.918
  I know what that meathead's   
      gonna be working on       

02:33.920 --> 02:37.222
      as soon as youse two      
get up in the woods alone.      

02:37.224 --> 02:39.357
                    Funny, Arch.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.691
         Hey, I'm back.         

02:40.693 --> 02:42.727
ARCHIE: Yeah. Come on, close    
the door, Irene. It's cold.     

02:42.729 --> 02:44.662
     I got the weather stripping
        for your cellar door.   

02:44.664 --> 02:46.464
Come on, you welsh!             
You pay me a buck!              

02:46.466 --> 02:47.465
                          No!   

02:47.467 --> 02:48.532
                Come on, Gloria.
                    Let's go.   

02:48.534 --> 02:50.135
Well, you can go,               
but not with that.              

02:50.137 --> 02:51.136
             Daddy!             

02:51.138 --> 02:52.536
      What are you doing?       
Give that back.                 

02:52.538 --> 02:53.738
      That's our lunches!       
        Give that back!         

02:53.740 --> 02:55.339
             You want the lunch,
            pay me the buck.    

02:55.341 --> 02:56.574
Oh, forget it,                  
Michael.                        

02:56.576 --> 02:57.642
Pay him and let's go.           

02:57.644 --> 02:58.709
          No. It would be lying.

02:58.711 --> 03:00.311
             In my opinion,     
        that joke was not funny.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.613
    And in my opinion,          
as the head of this house,      

03:02.615 --> 03:05.116
    the joke was damn funny.    

03:05.118 --> 03:06.584
                      All right.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.853
    All right, why don't we have
somebody else judge it, okay?   

03:08.855 --> 03:11.489
All right. If you can get       
     an indepartial judge.      

03:11.491 --> 03:13.057
              Uh,               
        how about Irene?        

03:13.059 --> 03:14.058
                All right, sure.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.226
                 Come on, Irene.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.861
         Get over here          
and judge this thing here.      

03:16.863 --> 03:19.063
Oh, no, you're not getting me   
involved in a family argument.  

03:19.065 --> 03:20.131
                     Come on.   
                 Come on, Irene.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.299
      Oh, come on,              
     Irene, please?             

03:21.301 --> 03:22.667
    Because we                  
    have to go.                 

03:22.669 --> 03:24.669
  Come on, this won't take long.
    Just sit right down.

            youse two!          

03:27.674 --> 03:29.473

and you tell me                 

03:29.475 --> 03:31.776
if Stretch Cunningham ain't     
the funniest guy you ever heard.

Don't prejudice her.            

03:33.613 --> 03:34.879
          What are you          
    talking about prejudice?    

03:34.881 --> 03:36.314
      Stretch Cunningham's      
          a white guy.

Milton Berlin,                  
Don Trickles and them, see,     

03:45.491 --> 03:48.526
but when you hear this guy here,
you're sure gonna laugh.        

03:48.528 --> 03:50.929

That was a funny joke.          

04:15.788 --> 04:17.755
You didn't laugh at it.         
What's the big idea?            

04:17.757 --> 04:19.156
          No big idea.          

04:19.159 --> 04:20.491
      No big joke either.

            the buck you owe me.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.464

that joke a decent burial.

        Have a good time

the pinko patrol up there.

your finger here.               

04:51.024 --> 04:53.992
            Yeah, all right.    
             Hurry up, will you?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.494
I'm so worried about going away 
for the whole weekend.          

04:56.496 --> 04:58.763
Are you sure you're             
gonna be all right?
