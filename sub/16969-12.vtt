the Orowheats conference
downtown this weekend.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.658
Oh, wow.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.660
Loren, I think that you might
finally have gotten woke.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.695
If my fiancÃ©
was getting whack-a-moled

22:42.729 --> 22:44.196
by eight guys
in a hotel room,

22:44.230 --> 22:46.533
I don't think that
I could handle it.
I couldn't.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.367
I guess I never thought of it
that way.
Yeah.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.203
Or at all, really,
but I'm cool with it.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.773
Yeah. I'm cool --
I'm cool with...

22:53.806 --> 22:56.175
Well, you should be,
'cause Jade is awesome.
Yes.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.376
She gave me
her business card,

22:57.410 --> 22:59.345
said that if I ever wanted
to change careers,

22:59.378 --> 23:00.680
give her a call, huh?

23:00.713 --> 23:01.881
Yeah. You'll stay busy

23:01.914 --> 23:03.550
because there are
plenty of sickos

23:03.583 --> 23:05.718
with ginger fetishes
in this world.
Yes.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.119
Oh, you guys
are too sweet.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.922
Yeah. I had
a pretty kickass night myself.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.525
Tampa found out
about my economic windfall,

23:12.559 --> 23:14.126
and she said,
"I want you to come home."

23:14.160 --> 23:15.094
-Hey.
-Oh!

23:15.127 --> 23:16.195
Yeah.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.030
I'm renting
the basement...

23:18.064 --> 23:19.732
for $2,500 a month.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.233
Wait, $2,500?
Yeah.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.803
Yeah, that is steep
for a none-bedroom,

23:23.836 --> 23:25.472
but I'm 15 feet away

23:25.505 --> 23:28.240
from being part
of my family again, so...

23:28.274 --> 23:30.810
Ohh! I just had the coolest
thing happen to me.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.245
-The mayor just called me.
-No way.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.814
Yes, huh. Yes, huh.
And guess what --

23:34.847 --> 23:37.484
He just made me
the new principal.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.885
-What?
-Are you serious?

23:38.918 --> 23:41.654
Yeah. Since Quinn
got arrested again, it's me!

23:41.688 --> 23:43.089
I'm the principal!

23:43.122 --> 23:45.424
Yeah, he said he'd never
seen passion like mine before,

23:45.458 --> 23:47.827
and anyone who's willing
to "self-imitate"

23:47.860 --> 23:49.095
in front of everyone

23:49.128 --> 23:51.097
is exactly the kind
of stable principal

23:51.130 --> 23:52.465
that Smoot deserves.

23:52.499 --> 23:55.602
No way. In what world
are you my boss?

23:55.635 --> 23:57.470
-This one, right now.
-Shut up.

23:57.504 --> 24:00.339
Fairbell, principal.
Wow.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.775
Abbey, you ought to protest
Gil Nash over this bull[bleep]

24:02.809 --> 24:05.678
I'm done protesting.
If Fairbell really is principal,

24:05.712 --> 24:09.448
then I'm gonna spend
some time on Abbey.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.984
Besides, how bad
can a real-estate mogul

24:12.018 --> 24:13.920
turned politician be?
[ Chuckles ]

24:13.953 --> 24:15.354
[ Ominous music plays ]

24:15.387 --> 24:18.991
Giving the job to that flaming
volleyball coach was genius.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.292
Ha!

24:20.326 --> 24:21.694
I was gonna put lead
in the drinking fountains,

24:21.728 --> 24:24.096
[Laughing] but this'll ruin
the school so much quicker.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.865
Yeah.
And after Captain...

24:25.898 --> 24:27.600
runs Smoot
into the ground...

24:27.634 --> 24:29.669
[ Chuckles ]
You get your corner unit.

24:29.702 --> 24:30.770
Uh-huh.

24:30.803 --> 24:35.642
And I get
my mixed-use condo.

24:35.675 --> 24:36.342
