00:02.635 --> 00:04.296
Hey, Kellogg, how was your weekend?

00:04.371 --> 00:05.963
Complete disaster, Carlton.

00:06.039 --> 00:08.234
I took this girl to see
New Kids on the Block...

00:08.308 --> 00:10.640
and all night she's saying,
"Donnie's so cute.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.076
"Donnie's so sweet, Donnie's so hunky."

00:14.114 --> 00:16.514
What does Donnie have that I don't have?

00:16.816 --> 00:19.341
My guess is you don't have the right stuff.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.988
All right, men, it's History time.

00:28.795 --> 00:30.422
Smith, you're late.

00:30.497 --> 00:33.330
Sorry about that, Coach, but...

00:33.533 --> 00:36.366
I thought I'd run a few laps before class.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.062
Help out the old basketball team.

00:40.140 --> 00:43.109
Good idea, Smith. Good way
to stay ahead of the competition.

00:43.176 --> 00:46.043
Might not be a bad idea
for all you men who are on the team...

00:46.112 --> 00:47.636
to start the day with a few laps.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.444
We run enough laps
at basketball practice, Coach Smiley.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.077
Okay, Hunt, we're not in the gym.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.320
Therefore, you are to refer to me
by my official teaching name:

00:57.457 --> 00:58.822
Professor Smiley.

00:59.426 --> 01:02.486
And for that little slip of the tongue,
20 laps.

01:03.096 --> 01:04.221
All right, men.

01:04.297 --> 01:06.891
Before we start the next chapter
in our History books...

01:06.966 --> 01:09.696
I'm going to give back
the pop quiz from Friday.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.703
I want you all to take these home...

01:11.771 --> 01:14.399
and bring them back
signed by your parents.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.673
I think I aced this one.
How about you, Will?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.473
I think I did just fine.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.155 --> 02:39.387
...and the way that you write your "A"
shows you're intelligent and playful.

02:40.026 --> 02:42.688
You can tell all that
from just my signature?

02:42.762 --> 02:44.491
- Yup.
- That's amazing.

02:44.697 --> 02:46.187
Do me, do me!

02:47.567 --> 02:49.501
Sign right there, under Ashley.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.536
Okay. So what do you see about me?

02:52.906 --> 02:56.137
Well, the bold vertical strokes
show that you're impulsive.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.512
The large capital letters
show that you're committed.

02:59.879 --> 03:02.473
And the little smiley face
you use to dot your "l"...

03:02.549 --> 03:05.177
shows that you got
way too much time on your hands.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.477
That's all true.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.848
Who does it say I'm going to marry?

03:11.524 --> 03:13.651
"Handsome movie star,
who will only be happy...

03:13.726 --> 03:16.024
"if you spend obscene amounts of money."

03:17.030 --> 03:18.429
You're good.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.229
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, honey.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.403
Daddy, Will knows how
to analyze people's handwriting.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.064
He's quite good, sir.

03:28.141 --> 03:31.736
One look at my signature and
he deduced that I was valiant...

03:31.811 --> 03:34.609
ingenious, and have the strength of 10.

03:35.915 --> 03:39.316
- Let me do yours, Uncle Phil.
- No, I don't believe in that nonsense.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.182
I'd hardly call it nonsense.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.284
Please, Daddy, it's fun.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.726
All right. Where do I sign?

03:48.161 --> 03:51.028
No, Uncle Phil.
You deserve a fresh piece of paper.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.808
- How about you, Aunt Viv?
- Sure. Why not?

04:07.981 --> 04:11.542
Will, this is always such a sad moment.

04:11.618 --> 04:12.642
What is?

04:12.719 --> 04:15.984
Getting you and Mom to sign
his "Hall of Shame" History exam.

04:16.522 --> 04:18.012
History exam?

04:20.360 --> 04:21.759
Sorry, Will.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.965
Mom, Dad, if it's any consolation,
I got an "A" on the test...

04:26.032 --> 04:28.398
and I must say I found it very easy.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.067
Carlton, Ashley,
we'd like to talk to Will alone.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.830
Will, what is going on here?

04:35.908 --> 04:37.466
You do so well in English and Math.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.306
How could you do so poorly in History?

04:39.379 --> 04:41.643
It's not my fault. That class is boring.

04:41.714 --> 04:43.409
Don't give us that, Will.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.813
No, what I meant was
they don't teach the whole story.

04:46.886 --> 04:50.185
We don't learn nothing about
the Black people in American history.

04:50.323 --> 04:53.884
If they taught that, maybe I'd be
more interested and work harder.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.024
That's not a bad idea.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.623
- It's not?
- It's not?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.026
It's not?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.027
Carlton, stop eavesdropping!

05:04.103 --> 05:05.229
Sorry, Mom.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.007
This does not excuse your bad grade...

05:09.075 --> 05:11.908
but you've made a good point
about the curriculum.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.008
So we all agree here?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.172
None of this is any of my fault?

05:16.482 --> 05:18.643
This has been a very productive meeting.

05:19.118 --> 05:20.107
Stay put.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.416
You brought up a valid point here...

05:22.488 --> 05:26.515
but if you want to learn Black history,
what are you gonna do about it?

05:28.027 --> 05:30.188
Don't just complain, baby, take action!

05:30.530 --> 05:32.862
Write a statement about
why more Black history...

05:32.932 --> 05:34.490
should be added to the curriculum.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.933
Present it at next week's
parent-teachers' meeting.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.368
I'll go with you.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.697
- You will?
- You will?

05:40.773 --> 05:41.762
You will?

05:44.544 --> 05:46.944
The administration
will consider the petition...

05:47.013 --> 05:49.846
suggesting that we change
the school motto to...

05:49.916 --> 05:52.077
"Bel-Air Academy: Love It...

05:52.151 --> 05:53.846
"Or Go To Public School."

05:55.254 --> 05:56.778
Any other new business?

05:56.856 --> 05:58.517
Headmaster Armstrong, I have some.

05:58.591 --> 05:59.683
Mr. Smith.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.027
This should certainly be fly.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.090
I think the students at this school
are being cheated...

06:07.166 --> 06:09.293
out of a valuable learning experience.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.701
I'm talking about
Coach Smiley's History class.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.636
That's Professor Smiley, Smith.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.298
That will be 10 laps.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.638
What's your concern, Mr. Smith?

06:18.711 --> 06:22.340
We learn about George Washington
and Thomas Jefferson...

06:22.582 --> 06:24.641
and them other dudes
that wound up on money...

06:24.717 --> 06:27.777
but what about Martin Luther King
and Crispus Attucks...

06:27.854 --> 06:31.221
and all the other Black people
that made a difference in this country?

06:31.290 --> 06:34.691
It's like when there wasn't no pictures
of any brothers on the wall.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.457
<i>You know Spike Lee's movie,
Do the Right Thing?</i>

06:38.264 --> 06:39.492
I'm sorry.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.227
<i>The last movie I saw
was Dead Poets Society.</i>

06:43.469 --> 06:45.061
With the right headmaster...

06:45.138 --> 06:47.902
that would have been
a completely different story.

06:49.342 --> 06:52.175
Coach Smiley, would you care
to respond to Mr. Smith?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.337
All right.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.272
I'd like to make three points.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.144
First, in my course,
we are trying to condense 200 and...

07:02.722 --> 07:04.417
some odd years of history...

07:04.490 --> 07:06.117
into nine months of lessons.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.023
Obviously, we have to concentrate...

07:08.094 --> 07:10.494
on some historical figures
and exclude others.

07:10.563 --> 07:11.723
That's true.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.393
Second, our school...

07:15.468 --> 07:18.631
has a fine library, or so I've been told...

07:19.338 --> 07:22.330
where any student can study
more about Black history.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.167
Another good point.

07:26.813 --> 07:27.837
Third:

07:28.514 --> 07:32.575
For years I have taught my course
from this well-respected textbook...

07:32.652 --> 07:37.021
and quite frankly, I don't know
a lick more than what's in this book.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.317
So forget it.

07:40.259 --> 07:43.422
- But I think it's important.
- And it is.

07:43.596 --> 07:47.896
Unfortunately, the school rulebook clearly
states that any requests pertaining to...

07:47.967 --> 07:49.901
curriculum changes be accompanied by...

07:49.969 --> 07:52.870
A petition signed
by 150 student signatures.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.964
Article 4, Section 9.

07:55.041 --> 07:57.532
Where'd you get ahold of that book?

07:57.610 --> 08:01.637
It certainly will take some time
to revise the curriculum.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.443
What about having somebody...

08:03.516 --> 08:05.575
come in to replace Coach Smiley
for a month...

08:05.651 --> 08:07.118
to teach some Black history?

08:07.186 --> 08:10.553
A month off? Armstrong,
I think the kid's got something here.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.788
Be that as it may,
I'm sure it will be some while...

08:15.862 --> 08:17.955
before we can find a teacher.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.156
So, unless there's any other new business,
this meeting is...

08:21.234 --> 08:25.068
I hate to say this, Mr. Armstrong,
but it sounds to me like you're stalling.

08:25.137 --> 08:26.434
Not at all, Mrs. Banks...

08:26.506 --> 08:29.634
we want to make sure that the person
we get is properly qualified.

08:29.709 --> 08:32.405
For example,
a college professor with a Ph. D...

08:32.477 --> 08:34.605
who's taught
Black History and Literature...

08:34.679 --> 08:35.874
at the university level?

08:35.948 --> 08:39.714
- Where would we find someone like that?
- You're looking at her.

08:40.486 --> 08:41.953
See you in a month.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.829
All right, now that we're studying
something I know...

08:50.897 --> 08:52.990
I'm gonna be the star of this class.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.657
No, you're not. I am.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.895
What, are you tripping?
How do you figure that?

08:56.969 --> 08:58.960
Because the teacher's my mommy.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.230
Good morning, class.

09:02.308 --> 09:05.607
Mom, I'd like to welcome you,
and say, on behalf of the entire class...

09:05.678 --> 09:07.805
how happy we are to have you here.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.138
What did you call me, Mr. Banks?

09:10.349 --> 09:12.544
What I always call you: "Mom."

09:13.786 --> 09:16.516
My name is not "Mom."
My name is Professor Banks.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.490
That is how I prefer to be addressed.
It that clear, class?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.249
Yes, Professor Banks.

09:22.361 --> 09:24.625
Black American history, gentlemen...

09:24.997 --> 09:27.397
from Africa, to slavery, to the present.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.563
We've all heard of Frederick Douglass...

09:29.635 --> 09:32.160
Martin Luther King
and Booker T. Washington.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.666
But Black history includes a lot of people...

09:34.740 --> 09:37.368
whose names and faces
aren't remembered today.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.977
How many of you have heard
the spirituals sung by the slaves?

09:41.113 --> 09:42.137
I have.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.116
Now listen to this:

10:14.347 --> 10:15.837
That was pretty cool.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.514
What do you suppose
the purpose of that song was?

10:19.819 --> 10:21.446
Let me handle this one.

10:23.155 --> 10:26.886
For those of you
unfamiliar with the spirituals...

10:29.795 --> 10:31.285
allow me to explain.

10:31.864 --> 10:33.627
The slaves used to sing them...

10:33.699 --> 10:36.566
to keep their spirits up
and their minds on God...

10:36.636 --> 10:39.196
in the face of all the oppression
that they suffered.

10:39.772 --> 10:42.969
That was very well put, Mr. Smith,
but you're wrong.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.976
I beg your pardon?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.275
That song was written to be used...

10:49.348 --> 10:51.839
as a secret code of
the Underground Railroad.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.407
Secret code? What do you mean?

10:53.486 --> 10:56.512
Can anyone tell me
what the Underground Railroad was?

10:57.123 --> 10:58.920
Now, this one I know.

11:00.626 --> 11:03.288
The Underground Railroad
was a group of people...

11:03.362 --> 11:04.829
that led the slaves to freedom.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.592
When was it established?

11:07.133 --> 11:08.430
During slavery.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.804
That covers about 250 years, Mr. Smith.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.241
Care to narrow it down a bit?

11:17.343 --> 11:19.140
What do you mean, right now?

11:20.079 --> 11:21.569
Sit down, Mr. Smith.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.576
It was established during the 1840s.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.550
Harriet Tubman, an ex-slave,
was one of the leaders.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.614
These gospel songs were actually
secret messages sent...

11:32.692 --> 11:35.320
to tell the runaway slaves
how to get to freedom.

11:35.394 --> 11:38.454
For example, "the drinking gourd"
referred to the Big Dipper.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.761
<i>When the slaves sang
Follow the Drinking Gourd...</i>

11:40.833 --> 11:44.428
that signaled to the runaway slaves
to run towards the Big Dipper.

11:44.503 --> 11:47.097
Along the route,
they would meet with the abolitionist...

11:47.173 --> 11:48.800
and escape to freedom.

11:49.141 --> 11:50.631
That's what I meant.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.210
Could you teach us
one of the songs, Professor?

11:54.280 --> 11:55.838
<i>Here's one called Wade in the Water.</i>

11:55.915 --> 12:00.249
This song told runaway slaves that
the best escape route was along the river.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.549
Late at night,
these songs could be heard...

12:02.621 --> 12:04.851
coming from slave cabins
along the route...

12:04.924 --> 12:06.949
guiding the runaways to freedom.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.900
Everybody, join in now.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.567
Come on, now.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.564
Now, all right.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.470
Not bad, guys.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.603
Next week's assignment will be a report
on the Port Royal Experiment...

13:02.681 --> 13:05.650
and the Penn School written by Mr. Smith.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.217
Who, me?

13:08.821 --> 13:10.379
This course was your idea.

13:10.456 --> 13:14.586
I think it only fitting you be given
the honor of the first assignment.

13:15.060 --> 13:17.654
Congratulations, Will. What an honor.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.927
Mr. Smith will write
the first half of the report...

13:23.002 --> 13:25.698
the second half
will be written by Mr. Banks.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.036
Who, me?

13:28.941 --> 13:30.909
I expect it to be at least 15 pages...

13:30.976 --> 13:34.503
typed, double-spaced,
with footnotes and a bibliography.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.141
This course was a brilliant idea.

13:38.284 --> 13:39.717
She's your mom!

13:44.256 --> 13:47.555
I can't believe Mom picked us
to do that special assignment.

13:47.893 --> 13:48.882
Word.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.327
Coach Smiley never would have did that.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.491
He used to say, "Extra work for you...

13:54.600 --> 13:56.329
"means extra work for me."

13:59.805 --> 14:01.272
Excuse me.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.864
Dibs on the tall one.

14:03.075 --> 14:06.135
Excuse me, miss.
Maybe you can help me out here.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.305
I've lost the feeling in my lips.

14:11.016 --> 14:14.679
I'm Carlton Banks.
That's right, the Carlton Banks.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.718
Want to slide out of here,
get something to eat?

14:18.791 --> 14:20.418
- Sure.
- Okay.

14:20.492 --> 14:23.427
Will, Carlton, I've been looking for you.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.162
I think class went pretty well today,
don't you?

14:27.233 --> 14:29.030
Yes. Got to go.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.127
Just a second. I've got something for you.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.695
This book will help you
with your research paper.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.365
It's about the Penn School.

14:36.442 --> 14:40.606
Charlotte Forten was one
of its first Black teachers and she...

14:40.679 --> 14:41.703
Will!

14:44.717 --> 14:47.049
- Are you listening to me?
- Of course.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.019
You were talking about the Penn School.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.079
What did I say about the Penn School?

14:51.156 --> 14:54.057
It's right around the corner
from the Pencil School?

14:57.296 --> 14:58.354
Thanks, Mom.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.830
Carlton, how many times
do I have to tell you...

15:00.900 --> 15:02.367
tuck in your shirt!

15:03.769 --> 15:06.533
Look at you. Honestly, Will...

15:06.772 --> 15:08.296
those eyebrows!

15:11.277 --> 15:13.541
Hurry up. We're going to the library.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.214
The tall one really liked me.

15:20.386 --> 15:24.083
Geoffrey, I'm going on my first
job interview at an art gallery...

15:24.156 --> 15:25.623
and I need some advice.

15:25.691 --> 15:28.125
You've been on a lot of job interviews,
haven't you?

15:28.193 --> 15:31.390
Why, yes, Miss Hilary.
I've worked my entire life.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.326
Really? Why?

15:35.167 --> 15:38.261
Because I've always been partial
to food and shelter.

15:39.505 --> 15:42.906
Okay. Anyway, I've been trying
to prepare for this interview...

15:42.975 --> 15:46.172
but every time I think about it,
I get really nervous.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.509
What do they ask you at these things?

15:49.048 --> 15:51.039
It's nothing to be nervous about.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.243
Just a few simple questions.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.344
For example, what is your name?

15:55.421 --> 15:57.446
- Hilary S. Banks.
- Education?

15:57.523 --> 15:58.854
Two years of college.

15:58.924 --> 16:02.018
What are your qualifications
to work in an art gallery?

16:02.094 --> 16:03.584
Well, I'm like...

16:04.430 --> 16:06.830
An art gallery, to me, is like...

16:07.433 --> 16:09.799
You know, it's like, okay.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.701
When I walk into an art gallery, it's like...

16:14.640 --> 16:17.541
Okay, if I had to choose, all right...

16:18.143 --> 16:21.044
It's like, I mean... Leave me alone!

16:24.016 --> 16:25.506
You're hired.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.885
- Is Aunt Viv here?
- Yes, she's in the kitchen. Shall l...

16:31.957 --> 16:33.219
No!

16:34.360 --> 16:36.089
She can't know we're here.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.655
She hasn't let us watch TV in a week.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.824
I'm getting withdrawal symptoms.

16:40.899 --> 16:43.459
My body needs
a certain amount of microwaves.

16:44.903 --> 16:47.701
Hi, guys. How's that history class coming?

16:47.773 --> 16:50.708
- Fine.
- Yeah. Decent, I guess.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.745
How are you doing
with your term papers and your...

16:53.812 --> 16:56.303
reading assignments
and your economic graphs...

16:56.382 --> 16:58.009
of the cotton industry?

16:59.018 --> 17:02.852
Dad, if you don't mind,
we'd rather not talk about History class.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.411
Okay, suit yourself.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.660
Uncle Phil, please.

17:17.236 --> 17:20.467
If memory serves,
this Black history class was your idea.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.905
I didn't know Aunt Viv was gonna teach it.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.635
She's driving us crazy.

17:24.742 --> 17:28.179
Last night, I had a dream that I went
to the prom with Harriet Tubman.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.046
Will, I saw this coming.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.953
You thought you'd get a free ride
in that class, didn't you?

17:38.023 --> 17:40.082
- No, I didn't.
- I sure did.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.621
I don't have any sympathy
for either one of you.

17:43.695 --> 17:45.720
Just because she's good
at teaching the class...

17:45.798 --> 17:47.629
and making you do some hard work...

17:47.699 --> 17:50.532
- you can't take it.
- Look, that's not it.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.002
For her own good, you have to warn her...

17:53.072 --> 17:56.132
if she keeps being so tough,
the whole class is gonna revolt.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.109
I can see it in the kids' faces.
They're on the edge.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.487
<i>Umoja.</i>

18:15.227 --> 18:16.489
What?

18:16.628 --> 18:19.222
<i>Umoja. It's Swahili for "unity." Dope, huh?</i>

18:19.298 --> 18:22.563
I got the whole Berlitz course
on cassette for my oral report today.

18:22.634 --> 18:25.034
<i>Did you take my Jet magazine?</i>

18:27.940 --> 18:30.033
No, I've got my own subscription.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.273
Good morning, class.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.913
Who would like to make
the first oral presentation?

18:39.485 --> 18:41.817
Jonathan, you did
your presentation yesterday.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.583
But I've done a whole new presentation,
just for fun.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.152
Before we make our presentations
we have something to say to you.

18:50.229 --> 18:53.756
A bunch of us were at Chadney's house
making our extra-credit dioramas...

18:53.832 --> 18:55.823
and we started talking.

18:56.001 --> 18:59.767
We agreed it's a shame you're going
to leave at the end of the month.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.133
Yeah, terrible.

19:01.206 --> 19:03.470
- That's a wack situation.
- A shame.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.672
So, anyway, we came up with this.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.407
It's a petition for you to become
our permanent history teacher.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.880
Shoot me.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.714
Guys...

19:16.855 --> 19:19.050
I'm overwhelmed. This is very flattering.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.592
According to the rulebook,
we need 150 signatures.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.525
So far we've collected 148.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.728
It'd be fun if the two signatures
to put it over were Will and Carlton.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.194
Guys, do the honors.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.544
After you, Will.

19:42.147 --> 19:43.944
No, you go ahead first.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.945
I insist.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.643
She's your mom.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.886
This class was your idea.

19:50.956 --> 19:53.686
Okay, listen, guys.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.285
I'm very touched
that you want me to stay...

19:57.696 --> 20:00.130
but I don't think
the university would approve.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.895
- But I don't see...
- Let's get back to work.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.531
Mr. Fletcher, would you care
to give your report, please?

20:22.287 --> 20:24.778
- Hi there, Aunt Viv.
- What are you doing?

20:25.557 --> 20:27.047
Just grading papers.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.791
The class coming over later?

20:29.861 --> 20:32.887
Yeah. Maybe you can tell us
more about Harriet Tubman.

20:34.132 --> 20:36.123
I never get enough of her.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.237
I think you did get enough.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.401
You thought one month was enough.

20:46.044 --> 20:49.912
Mom, I'm sorry if I wasn't as enthusiastic
as the rest of the guys.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.450
You're a great teacher. It's just...

20:54.253 --> 20:56.778
I hope you don't take this the wrong way...

20:57.289 --> 20:59.780
but you made our lives a living nightmare.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.318
How did I do that?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.390
You ragged me in front of the whole class.

21:06.531 --> 21:09.898
You gave us all that extra work
and made us do those reports.

21:10.335 --> 21:13.099
I didn't hear any complaints
from the rest of the class.

21:13.171 --> 21:15.731
That's because you were harder
on the two us.

21:16.441 --> 21:19.239
I'm sorry you felt
I was being hard on you...

21:19.478 --> 21:21.241
but I thought the two Black students...

21:21.313 --> 21:24.510
would actually want to get
the most out of the course.

21:26.385 --> 21:28.876
I guess we didn't think about it that way.

21:30.188 --> 21:31.212
Mom.

21:31.890 --> 21:32.914
Yes.

21:33.358 --> 21:35.121
This whole ugly episode...

21:39.264 --> 21:41.789
it's not going to affect my grade, will it?

21:47.105 --> 21:49.232
I'm a very tough grader, Carlton.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.701
And you're very beautiful, Mommy.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.139
Will, there's one thing
I've been wondering.

21:58.383 --> 21:59.372
What's that?

21:59.451 --> 22:02.477
Why did you want a course
in Black history in the first place?

22:02.554 --> 22:04.351
- I'm interested in it.
- Are you really?

22:04.423 --> 22:05.447
Of course.

22:05.524 --> 22:08.459
You didn't seem happy
about all the work I was giving you.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.518
Weren't you the one who said
if you were...

22:10.595 --> 22:12.825
interested in something,
you would study hard?

22:12.898 --> 22:17.164
<i>Aunt Viv, I read The Autobiography
of Malcolm X three times.</i>

22:17.235 --> 22:19.703
That makes you
a serious student on Black history?

22:19.771 --> 22:21.671
That's a very important book.

22:22.574 --> 22:24.565
Will, you can read that book...

22:24.743 --> 22:28.543
you can wear the T-shirts, put up
the posters, and shout the slogans...

22:28.613 --> 22:31.275
but unless you know
all the history behind it...

22:31.350 --> 22:33.750
you're trivializing the entire struggle.

22:40.892 --> 22:43.417
Now you started something
very good here...

22:44.896 --> 22:47.421
but it's up to you to follow through on it.
