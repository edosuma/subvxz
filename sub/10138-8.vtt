14:32.330 --> 14:33.707
Where's pops?

14:33.748 --> 14:36.167
Pops went to go get

14:33.748 --> 14:36.167
some cappuccino.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.796
And where were you?

14:36.209 --> 14:39.796
Madonna's garage sale?

14:39.838 --> 14:41.422
You're Danny's little Michelle?

14:41.464 --> 14:44.801
Who you expectin',

14:41.464 --> 14:44.801
Little Miss Muffet?

14:44.843 --> 14:46.886
Move it or lose it.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.640
Is my root beer here yet?

14:50.682 --> 14:54.018
I like to suck it back

14:50.682 --> 14:54.018
before all the foam's gone.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.817
Hey, kid. What happened to you?

15:00.859 --> 15:02.318

What have you been

15:20.879 --> 15:23.631
telling<i> blondie</i> about me?

15:26.676 --> 15:28.469
First, Michelle,

15:26.676 --> 15:28.469
it isn't Halloween.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.221
Second, you're not an MTV VJ.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.305
So tell me what's going on?

15:31.347 --> 15:33.974
Hey, I'm just being myself.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.852
Bad to the bone.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.606
Michelle, I've seen your X-rays,

15:37.562 --> 15:39.606

15:39.647 --> 15:42.400
in your body. Out of the booth.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.319
Look, I want you out of these

15:42.442 --> 15:45.319
clothes, changed right now

15:45.361 --> 15:46.987

15:45.361 --> 15:46.987

15:47.029 --> 15:48.740

16:06.466 --> 16:09.552
I'm too depressed to play.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.888
I gave D.J. a goofy

16:09.594 --> 16:11.888
gift like you told me

16:11.930 --> 16:13.681
and she hated it.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.808
You're young.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.808
You got good hair.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.684
You'll bounce back.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.684
Come on.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.770
I'm sorry, Jess, uh..

16:18.812 --> 16:22.022
I just can't play

16:18.812 --> 16:22.022
when I feel like this.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.150
You just can't play

16:22.064 --> 16:24.150
when you feel like..

16:24.191 --> 16:25.944
Does the fact that

16:24.191 --> 16:25.944
my career's on the line

16:25.985 --> 16:27.278
that has no effect on you?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.155
Yeah, I feel really

16:27.320 --> 16:29.155
bad about that.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.950
And that makes

16:29.196 --> 16:31.950

Oh, I-I don't know what to say.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.961
We're just too different.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.129
Deej, haven't you ever

16:43.002 --> 16:45.129
heard of opposites attract?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.380
I mean, take a look at

16:45.171 --> 16:46.380
your Aunt Becky and me.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.632
I mean, you know,

16:46.422 --> 16:47.632
in some ways

16:47.674 --> 16:49.133
we couldn't be more

16:47.674 --> 16:49.133
different, you know?

16:49.175 --> 16:50.551
I mean, we-we're

16:49.175 --> 16:50.551
constantly having

16:50.593 --> 16:52.178
these fights about

16:50.593 --> 16:52.178
television, right?

16:52.219 --> 16:55.556
Over sports

16:52.219 --> 16:55.556
or "Melrose Place."

16:55.598 --> 16:56.933
And once in a while,

16:55.598 --> 16:56.933
I have to just give in

16:56.975 --> 16:59.936
and watch a football

16:56.975 --> 16:59.936
game with her.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.313
Now, come on, go talk to him,

16:59.978 --> 17:02.313
please. I need him onstage.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.690

Come on, you guys. You have

17:08.820 --> 17:13.658
something very special here.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.785
See, a relationship is like a..

17:15.827 --> 17:18.329
...well, it's like

17:15.827 --> 17:18.329
a little flower, if you will.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.956
It needs water.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.208
It needs care in

17:19.998 --> 17:22.208
order for it to grow.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.919
But fighting is like

17:22.249 --> 17:24.919
a, is like a hailstorm

17:24.961 --> 17:27.505
that kind of, it kind of

17:24.961 --> 17:27.505
pounds your flower down.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.507
Down, flower,

17:27.547 --> 17:29.507
down, flower.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.969
But with love

17:30.717 --> 17:32.969
and understanding..

17:33.011 --> 17:34.846
...your flower can grow.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.598
It could stand tall

17:34.888 --> 17:37.598
and stretch its petals

17:37.640 --> 17:39.058
and..

17:39.099 --> 17:40.393
...kiss the sun.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.230
So, what do you guys say?

17:41.978 --> 17:44.230
Can you kiss and make up?

17:46.482 --> 17:48.484
I'm sorry.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.695
