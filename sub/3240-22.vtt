i happen to be wrong.

about the guard.

You lied to me, henry.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.067

about the pugio.

She was a colleague of yours
at the museum.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.631

21:40.633 --> 21:43.034

to the back of the head.

He's not gonna break.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.936
We're gonna need
dna from the baton

to the murder.

21:47.206 --> 21:50.007
May i suggest
we focus more on motive --

21:50.009 --> 21:52.843
Perhaps tying him
to the missing pugio dagger?

21:52.845 --> 21:54.512

murder weapon?

21:54.514 --> 21:55.813

you were off of that.

this man acting alone.

for him?

some quick cash?

22:01.921 --> 22:04.388
Check out his hands.
They're shaking.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.590
Maybe
he's feeding a habit.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.559
No.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.860
They're muscle spasms.

narcotic withdrawal symptoms.

He has kidney disease.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.936
Maybe<i> that's</i>
hanson's strategy --

22:18.938 --> 22:22.139
Keep him in there
until one of them passes out.

this war of attrition take?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.389
Hours, days.

Legally, we can keep the guy
up to 72 hours,

So better juice up.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.932
Perhaps a, uh,
gentler approach

22:47.934 --> 22:50.167
Might yield quicker results,

that death follows the dagger,

Perhaps not quite as dapper,
but a decent man.

33:57.569 --> 34:00.971
My first death also came

34:00.973 --> 34:04.107
Trying to save the life
of another.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.076
Alas, i failed.

34:07.212 --> 34:10.113
So, take a good look,
henry.

34:10.115 --> 34:14.885
This is what a decent man
looks like after 2,000 years.

34:17.523 --> 34:20.524
Are you not feeling chatty
today?

34:20.526 --> 34:22.959
Oh, i don't blame you.

34:22.961 --> 34:25.262
You're here to kill me.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.764
You're not the first.

34:27.766 --> 34:30.534
Maybe you'll be
the last.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.876
Goodbye, adam.

34:39.878 --> 34:42.379
Game's over.

34:43.816 --> 34:47.017
You don't get to not play,
henry!

34:47.019 --> 34:48.952
Do i need to recount

34:48.954 --> 34:53.490
The final agonizing moments
of dear abigail's life?

34:56.028 --> 34:58.562
Have you seen<i> this?</i>

34:58.564 --> 35:00.697
She had it on her
when she died.

35:00.699 --> 35:04.801
Sentimental till the end.

35:04.803 --> 35:08.105

You have my gun?!

35:21.687 --> 35:24.888
Was this the point
of your game --

35:24.890 --> 35:26.790
To test a theory?

35:26.792 --> 35:29.092
"does the gun work?
Does the dagger work?

35:29.094 --> 35:30.260
Can we die?"

35:30.262 --> 35:32.729
Do you think
i'm afraid of death?!

35:32.731 --> 35:34.998
No, but you're afraid
of<i> something --</i>

35:35.000 --> 35:37.601
Something you fear
far more than death.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.270
Did you know that your partner
followed you down here?

35:40.272 --> 35:42.672
You stay away from her.

Her?

35:43.575 --> 35:45.108
Oh, you're not thinking,
henry.

35:45.110 --> 35:48.445
What you fear
more than anything in this world

35:48.447 --> 35:53.016
Is someone
learning about your secret.

35:53.018 --> 35:57.020
I assume
she heard that last shot.

And one of two things
will happen.

But his brain
