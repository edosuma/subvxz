00:20.416 --> 00:23.833
[BTG] <i>Curious allies,</i>
<i>zebra and ostrich tolerate each other</i>

00:23.916 --> 00:25.791
<i>to avoid hungry predators.</i>

00:25.875 --> 00:29.458
<i>The zebra relies</i>
<i>on the ostrich's height and huge eyes,</i>

00:29.541 --> 00:33.083
<i>which are larger than an elephant's,</i>
<i>to see hidden dangers,</i>

00:33.166 --> 00:36.833
<i>while the ostrich depends</i>
<i>on the zebra's superb sense of smell.</i>

00:38.083 --> 00:39.125
Easy, buddy.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.583
Just a friendly ostrich
casually probing your anus

00:41.666 --> 00:42.791
for fecal parasites.

00:42.875 --> 00:44.750
-[Dietrich] Bees!
-[braying]

00:44.833 --> 00:46.500
Oh no. [screams]

00:47.083 --> 00:48.208

00:48.291 --> 00:49.666
[groans] Buttocks.

[Dietrich yelping]

00:51.375 --> 00:53.250
-[bees buzzing]
-Hypodermic needles with wings.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.791
They're gonna give me hepatitis!

00:54.875 --> 00:58.125
-Bees can't give you hepatitis, Dietrich.
-How do you know, Bonnie?

00:58.208 --> 00:59.541
Uh… Huh.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.250
-I guess I don't.
-Well, I-- [gasps]

01:02.333 --> 01:03.458
[coughs]

01:03.541 --> 01:06.041
-I hate nature so much right now.
-[scoffs]

01:06.125 --> 01:08.625
Dietrich, when I'm elbow-deep
in a zebra's anus,

01:08.708 --> 01:10.291
I need you to keep it down, okay?

01:10.375 --> 01:14.166
Ten years as my field assistant,
I'm surprised you don't know that.

01:14.250 --> 01:15.291
I do know that,

01:15.375 --> 01:18.125
but I've also seen hateful bees
sting you so many times

01:18.208 --> 01:19.791
your skin looked like pre-chewed gum.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.625
Ha! That was such a great day.

01:21.708 --> 01:24.416
[inhales deeply] Still not sure
why you'd carry that photo around.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.875
I've got one too, Uncle B.

01:25.958 --> 01:28.958
From when you brought a Tasmanian devil
to my sixth birthday party.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.041
[BTG] Oh yes.

01:30.125 --> 01:32.458
[laughs] Good times!

01:32.541 --> 01:35.750
You really need to embrace
nature's wonders and horrors.

01:35.833 --> 01:37.458
Just try to be more like Bonnie.

01:37.541 --> 01:41.541
But this is her first expedition.
She should be more like me.

01:41.625 --> 01:44.291
[shrieks] I'm not vaccinated!

01:44.375 --> 01:48.083
Don't worry! I've been prepping
for this expedition my entire life.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.166
I've got everything.

01:49.250 --> 01:52.500
GPS, bug spray,
tranquilizer gun, an apple--

01:52.583 --> 01:53.833
No guns.

01:53.916 --> 01:54.833
Huh?

01:55.291 --> 01:57.416
-[gunfire]
-[people shouting and screaming]

01:58.541 --> 02:00.125

[people shouting and screaming]

02:02.541 --> 02:03.458
[bomb exploding]

02:03.541 --> 02:04.875
Incoming wounded!

02:05.958 --> 02:07.125
[gasps]

02:08.166 --> 02:09.583
[monitor beeping]

02:15.500 --> 02:17.416
Those animals!

02:17.500 --> 02:18.625
[bullet clattering]

02:20.708 --> 02:21.666
[grunting]

02:21.750 --> 02:23.625

-Huh?

02:23.708 --> 02:25.583
-Ahh!
-[growls]

[BTG groaning]

02:27.416 --> 02:28.500
[growling]

02:29.250 --> 02:31.166
-Keep your whiskers up, sunshine.
-[tiger growls]

02:31.250 --> 02:33.000
Lieutenant Greive,

02:33.083 --> 02:35.458
did you bring a tiger
to the medical tent again?

02:35.541 --> 02:38.333
It's an Indochinese tiger, sir.
They're almost extinct.

02:38.416 --> 02:42.708
Bah! Do you know how many signs
I had to commission because of you?

02:42.791 --> 02:44.583
-[chopper hovering]
-Uh…

02:44.666 --> 02:47.750
That's my ex-wife, Linda.
Can't be too careful.

02:47.833 --> 02:48.833
[fighter planes whizzing]

02:48.916 --> 02:51.833
-[bombs exploding]
-You're my best paratrooper commander

02:51.916 --> 02:55.375
and the only decent baritone
in the officers' a cappella group,

02:55.458 --> 02:57.000
but you have to make a choice.

02:57.083 --> 03:00.666
Are you gonna be part of this regiment,
or are you gonna play with wild animals?

03:01.833 --> 03:03.833
[dramatic music playing]

03:06.291 --> 03:09.041
The animals need me more.

03:10.208 --> 03:14.250
Ah, that Bradley Trevor Greive
is a magnificent lunatic.

03:14.333 --> 03:17.458
How long do you think he can maintain
that incredible physique?

03:17.958 --> 03:19.625
[animal growling]

03:19.708 --> 03:22.875
-[screeching]

03:24.250 --> 03:26.375
-[gunfire]
-[people shouting and screaming]

03:28.583 --> 03:31.291
Um… You were saying?

03:31.375 --> 03:33.625
[BTG] Rule number one
of Greive expeditions.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.833
If you need a gun
to feel safe in the wild,

03:35.916 --> 03:37.666
you don't belong out here.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.833
Stay home.

03:38.916 --> 03:39.875
Wait, what?

03:39.958 --> 03:42.041
I thought rule number one
of Greive expeditions

03:42.125 --> 03:43.458
was never try to save you.

03:43.541 --> 03:47.375
Correct, you should never try to save me.
There are two rule number ones.

03:47.875 --> 03:50.166
[munching]

03:50.750 --> 03:51.583
Excellent.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.625
The last animals in a parasite census

03:53.708 --> 03:55.458
are always the most rewarding.

03:55.541 --> 03:59.458
You two, stay here
and, uh, practice your tweezer technique.

03:59.541 --> 04:02.041
Yes! Something in my comfort zone.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.333
Watch and learn, Bonnie.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.875
[grunting]

04:07.458 --> 04:08.958
[scoffs] Oh my God.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.500
[braying]

04:14.416 --> 04:15.375
[Bonnie] Agh!

04:15.458 --> 04:18.166
Don't you get bored
watching BTG do all the fun stuff?

04:18.833 --> 04:20.125
[grunts] Mmm.

04:20.208 --> 04:23.375
This feces is chock-full
of amazing parasites.

04:23.458 --> 04:27.166
Other than the birth of my daughter,
this is the best day of my life.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.083
Um, my idea of fun is a little different.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.416
You ever play Mahjong?

04:31.500 --> 04:33.125
So exciting!

04:33.208 --> 04:36.375
I stay awake at night
dreaming of chows, pongs, and kongs.

04:36.458 --> 04:37.916
-[bushes rustling]
-[gasps] Ooh!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.541
Look, something's in those bushes.

04:39.625 --> 04:41.250
-We should check it out.
-Are you nuts?

04:41.333 --> 04:42.625
Fine, I'll check it out.

04:42.708 --> 04:45.083
Just stay here
and practice your tweezering.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.125
Listen to me.

04:46.208 --> 04:50.208
Every field assistant BTG's ever had
died a horrible death.

04:50.291 --> 04:54.375
I actually saw one get nature-murdered
on my very first day.

04:55.666 --> 04:59.791
<i>I was a free-spirited grad student</i>
<i>with washboard abs and perfect skin</i>

04:59.875 --> 05:01.208
<i>on a research trip.</i>

05:01.291 --> 05:04.000
-[screaming]
<i>-BTG had plunged into the open sea</i>

05:04.083 --> 05:06.958
<i>to tag a shortfin mako shark</i>
<i>with his field assistant, Ulrich.</i>

05:07.041 --> 05:07.958
Shark monster!

05:08.541 --> 05:09.875
[whimpering]

05:09.958 --> 05:11.708
-[grunts]
-Are you done? Good.

05:11.791 --> 05:12.875
We need to head back.

05:12.958 --> 05:15.416
Ulrich's been attacked by a shark,
but he should be…

05:15.916 --> 05:17.125
Oh, that's not good.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.166
Oh my God! Ulrich!

05:20.250 --> 05:23.375
-[retches]
-Did you just cough up a hot dog?

05:23.458 --> 05:25.625
I don't chew properly when I'm stressed.

05:25.708 --> 05:27.166
Ah, no shame in that.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.041
Sharks vomit up entire meals

05:29.125 --> 05:31.416
to distract larger sharks
from eating them.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.541
Mmm! Wow. Dietrich, I have good news. Mmm!

05:35.625 --> 05:37.708
You are my new field assistant.

05:38.208 --> 05:39.708
What? Me?

05:40.333 --> 05:43.041
But I'm only here for three days
for college credit.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.000
I don't wanna be a field zoologist.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.750
I wanna be a zoology professor
at UC Davis.

05:47.833 --> 05:51.041
Mmm, don't worry, this is gonna be great
for your career. [munches]

05:51.625 --> 05:52.500
Or you'll die.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.875
Either way, it's a step forward,
so congratulations.

05:55.958 --> 05:57.541
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

05:58.166 --> 05:59.500
Okay. [inhales deeply]

05:59.583 --> 06:03.083
Let's tag another shark while there's
still so much blood in the water.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.833
Oh, goodbye, Ulrich.

06:04.916 --> 06:07.333
You were a great field assistant.

06:07.958 --> 06:09.208
One of the best.

06:09.916 --> 06:10.958
In you go!

06:13.791 --> 06:15.208
That was ten years ago,

06:15.791 --> 06:18.208
making me BTG's
longest surviving field assistant

06:18.291 --> 06:20.875
by nine years and six months.

06:20.958 --> 06:23.708
You know how I managed
to survive all that time, Bonnie?

06:24.208 --> 06:27.125
I never do anything.

06:28.750 --> 06:29.583
Bonnie?

06:32.583 --> 06:34.041
Oh, hello!

06:34.125 --> 06:36.125
Aren't you a cute little furry thing?

06:36.208 --> 06:37.375
-[snarling]
-Whoa!

06:37.458 --> 06:38.791
[BTG yelling]

06:38.875 --> 06:41.083
[braying]

06:41.166 --> 06:42.958
Bonnie! Back to the jeep!

06:43.041 --> 06:45.250
-[growling]
-Whoa! Aah!

06:45.333 --> 06:46.208
Aah!

06:46.291 --> 06:48.041
[snarling]

06:48.791 --> 06:49.958
[yells, grunts]

06:51.458 --> 06:52.833
[gasps] Ha!

06:52.916 --> 06:54.250
It's my lucky day!

06:55.416 --> 06:56.541
[grunts, pants]

06:57.250 --> 06:59.291
Bonnie! Bonnie!

07:00.625 --> 07:02.791
-Over here!
-[snarling]

07:04.041 --> 07:04.875
Crap!

07:04.958 --> 07:06.916
No, no, no, no, no! [pants]

07:08.833 --> 07:11.125
Help! The headlights won't turn on!

07:11.208 --> 07:12.291
[jeep revving]

07:15.041 --> 07:17.458
[grunts] Good thinking, Dietrich!

07:18.250 --> 07:20.000
[horn blaring]

07:21.041 --> 07:23.041
[whimpering]

07:23.125 --> 07:24.916
Bonnie, listen to me.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.500
You need to stay with the herd
to be protected.

07:27.583 --> 07:28.916
Loners get picked off.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.583
I thought I saw danger.
Turns out I was right.

07:31.666 --> 07:32.541
There were lions.

07:32.625 --> 07:35.750
You're not in a classroom now.
This is the wild.

07:35.833 --> 07:38.416
I need you to hang back,
observe and learn.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.833
Ugh! But you've been telling me
that my entire life.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.875
-Now can I go into the field with you?
-[slurping]

07:45.958 --> 07:47.458
No, Bonbon. [chuckling]

07:47.541 --> 07:49.000
You're too young. [slurping]

07:49.625 --> 07:51.541
Now can I go into the field with you?

07:51.625 --> 07:53.791
No, Bonnie, you need more training.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.333
Now can I go into the field with you?

07:56.416 --> 07:58.416
No, Bonnie! You're too…

07:58.500 --> 07:59.375
Hang on.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.208
Hello? Mrs. Peterson?

08:01.291 --> 08:04.833
Yes, thanks for calling.
I'm sorry, I've… I've got to take this.

08:04.916 --> 08:07.250
You're talking into a banana!

08:08.083 --> 08:09.625
I'm a grown woman, Uncle B.

08:09.708 --> 08:12.791
If you really want me to learn,
you're gonna have to let me get hurt.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.541
[BTG] So, I'm a little overprotective.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.916
[all screaming]

08:16.000 --> 08:17.625
-[huffs]
-It's an ambush!

08:17.708 --> 08:20.291
Look at that bird!
He's the brains of the operation.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.041
Sorry, big fella.
That's just a cattle egret.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.041
The Cape buffalo tolerates the egret

08:25.125 --> 08:27.708
because it eats parasites
and insects off his skin.

08:27.791 --> 08:30.458
Easy meal for the bird,
good hygiene for the buffalo.

08:30.541 --> 08:33.333
I love animal friends
that shouldn't be friends.

08:33.416 --> 08:36.375
One time, I saw a video of a bear
who was friends with a duck.

08:36.458 --> 08:38.333
Yeah, I saw that video.

08:38.416 --> 08:40.583
I'm pretty sure
those animals were drugged.

08:40.666 --> 08:43.916
-[groans]
-Anyway, I wouldn't call them friends<i>,</i>

08:44.000 --> 08:47.500
more like a mutualistic relationship
where each benefits from the other.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.041
Blah, blah, blah. They're BFFs.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.291
If it looks like a duck
and sounds like a duck--

08:51.375 --> 08:52.708
Crows sound like ducks.

08:52.791 --> 08:55.750
-Would you say that we're friends?
-Not now, Dietrich. Look!

08:55.833 --> 08:58.583
-[buffalo chuffing]
-[BTG gasps] Black gold.

08:58.666 --> 09:00.958
This is gonna be a parasite bonanza!

09:01.041 --> 09:03.041
[humming]

09:04.041 --> 09:05.750
-[bellows gently]
-Don't mind me.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.083
All we need to find now
is a mountain nyala,

09:10.166 --> 09:12.458
the pride of Ethiopia.

09:12.541 --> 09:17.208
Ah! There's nothing quite as invigorating
as a good parasite census.

09:17.291 --> 09:20.916
Have you ever tried recreational drugs?
Because I have news for you.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.750
Inappropriate uncle talk, Bonnie.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.958
But, yes,
I once licked a Sonoran Desert toad,

09:26.041 --> 09:27.458
but this is better.

09:27.541 --> 09:29.958
Big b-buffalo b-back-o!

09:30.041 --> 09:31.458
[grunting angrily]

09:31.541 --> 09:33.000
[all screaming]

09:33.083 --> 09:34.416
[BTG screams]

09:35.666 --> 09:37.625
-[jeep crashing]
-Oh no! Uncle B!

09:37.708 --> 09:39.000
Give it up, Bonnie.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.500
BTG's dead.

09:41.000 --> 09:41.958
You're a Greive,

09:42.041 --> 09:46.166
and your initials are BTG, which means
you can legally sign my paychecks,

09:46.250 --> 09:51.625
and, also, that makes you next in line
to lead the Greive expeditions, right?

09:51.708 --> 09:53.750
Um… Yeah. Yes.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.791
I… I guess so.

09:56.625 --> 09:57.458
Phew.

09:57.958 --> 10:02.083
Well, congratulations, Dietrich,
you're my new field assistant.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.125
Wha… What? Me?

10:04.208 --> 10:05.416
Oh God!

10:05.500 --> 10:07.916
-Did I even graduate college?
-Come on.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.916
Uncle B! Uncle B!

10:11.000 --> 10:13.833
Ah. Crap. There's no sign of him.

10:14.375 --> 10:15.500
Uncle B!

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
[cawing]

10:22.083 --> 10:23.791
[groaning]

10:23.875 --> 10:25.416
[screaming]

10:25.500 --> 10:27.541
-[thuds on ground]
-[groans]

10:28.125 --> 10:29.166
Not dead yet.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.541
-[crashing]
-[horn blaring]

10:31.625 --> 10:32.791
[groans]

10:33.500 --> 10:34.666
[cawing]

10:34.750 --> 10:38.166
Back off! I'm not being eaten alive
beneath the jeep.

10:38.250 --> 10:41.083
That's what happened
to my old field assistant, Bardrich.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.083
Fifty thousand social spiders
working together

10:44.166 --> 10:46.166
built that collective super web.

10:46.250 --> 10:49.125
Their cooperation allows them
to capture far larger prey

10:49.208 --> 10:52.291
than any single spider
could ever dream of.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.958
Pretty cool, right, Bardrich?

10:54.041 --> 10:56.291
I'm not Bardrich. My name's Emmerich.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.791
Oh, sorry. What happened to Bardrich?

10:58.875 --> 11:02.125
-I love my job! I love my life!
-[grunting ferociously]

11:02.208 --> 11:03.375
[screaming]

11:03.458 --> 11:04.916
Oh, right.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.791
Well, anyway, you get my point,
right, Emmerich?

11:08.916 --> 11:11.166
Wow, that's the quickest one yet.

11:11.250 --> 11:14.125
-[cawing]
-I refuse to be a Bardrich.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.250
Agh!

11:15.958 --> 11:18.333
[grunting]

11:19.916 --> 11:21.666
For the last time, Dietrich,

11:21.750 --> 11:24.333
there is no such thing
as mountain crocodiles.

11:24.916 --> 11:26.208
-Bonnie!
-[Bonnie gasps]

11:26.291 --> 11:28.000
Yes! I knew you weren't dead!

11:28.083 --> 11:29.875
Or are you a zombie?

11:29.958 --> 11:33.000
You just emerged from the earth,
and your face is bloated and disgusting.

11:33.083 --> 11:36.125
Thank God!
Someone who actually knows something.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.125
Are mountain crocodiles a thing?

11:38.208 --> 11:40.958
In the Cardamom Mountains
of Cambodia? Yes!

11:41.041 --> 11:43.791
I knew it!
I'm never listening to Bonnie again.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.250
[scoffs] Son of a…

11:45.333 --> 11:48.833
-[wolves calling]
-Uh-oh. Ethiopian wolves.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.666
Here, put these on.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.458
[Dietrich] Monkey suits?

11:52.541 --> 11:56.125
It's finally happened. BTG's gone insane.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.875
[BTG] <i>Ethiopian wolves</i>
<i>could eat young gelada monkeys,</i>

11:58.958 --> 12:03.375
<i>but instead of fighting and getting hurt,</i>
<i>they choose to hunt together.</i>

12:03.458 --> 12:07.791
<i>The monkeys expose small rodents</i>
<i>while digging up tubers and plant shoots.</i>

12:07.875 --> 12:11.166
<i>An easy meal for the wolves</i>
<i>and added protection for the monkeys.</i>

12:11.250 --> 12:13.083
-[snarling]
<i>-Classic mutualism.</i>

12:13.166 --> 12:15.458
You mean, animal friends
that shouldn't be friends?

12:15.541 --> 12:18.041
Sort of like… us?

12:18.125 --> 12:18.958
Sure.

12:19.041 --> 12:21.958
Trusted friends, temporary colleagues.
Well, whatever.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.583
-[rustling]
-[wolves calling]

12:23.666 --> 12:26.833
Those wolves do not wanna be
this far down the mountain.

12:26.916 --> 12:29.583
-[animal growling]
-Uh-oh. In fact…

12:30.416 --> 12:31.916
[snarling]

12:32.000 --> 12:33.500
-[roaring]
-[BTG screaming]

12:33.583 --> 12:36.583
Go ahead, lion. Finish what you started.

12:36.666 --> 12:37.541
[Bonnie] Uncle B!

12:37.625 --> 12:38.708
No, Bonnie!

12:38.791 --> 12:40.208
Rule number one!

12:40.291 --> 12:41.458
Which rule number one?

12:41.541 --> 12:42.833
[snarling]

12:42.916 --> 12:44.000
Whoa!

12:44.083 --> 12:46.208
-[growling]
-[grunting]

12:46.291 --> 12:49.708
-[groaning] Get up that tree! Now!
-[growling]

12:50.750 --> 12:51.875
[bees buzzing]

12:51.958 --> 12:53.250
[BTG] Back here, lions.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.000
-I'm your main course!
-[snarling]

12:55.083 --> 12:58.125
[laughs] And probably dessert as well,
if I'm being honest.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.958
-[lions growling]
-[BTG screaming]

13:00.041 --> 13:01.791
Bonnie, this is your chance!

13:01.875 --> 13:04.958
Escape while they feast
on my marbled flesh and gristle!

13:05.041 --> 13:07.958
Carry on the Greive name. Make me proud.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.500
No! No! No!

13:09.583 --> 13:12.041
If we don't help you,
we're not your field assistants.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.041
We're just parasites!

13:14.125 --> 13:16.875
I'm not an Aldrich,
or a Bardrich, or a Dietrich.

13:16.958 --> 13:18.750
-No offense, Dietrich.
-Oh, none taken.

13:18.833 --> 13:20.166
I have very high self-worth.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.958
I'm breaking rule number one.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.458
I'm still not gonna do anything.

13:25.583 --> 13:26.833
[grunting]

13:26.916 --> 13:28.583
-[grunting]
-[growling]

13:29.541 --> 13:31.166
-[grunts]
-Aah!

13:31.250 --> 13:32.125
Ooh, sorry!

13:32.208 --> 13:33.625
[grunts]

13:33.708 --> 13:35.083
[bees buzzing]

13:35.166 --> 13:36.416
-[growls]
-[screaming]

13:36.500 --> 13:38.000
[all screaming]

13:42.166 --> 13:44.166
[coughs, laughs]

13:45.250 --> 13:47.041
Ah! I have to admit,

13:47.125 --> 13:49.833
that was a brilliant
zoological strategy, Bonbon.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.000
Thank God I went to an Ivy League school.

13:52.083 --> 13:55.958
If there's one thing I know how to do,
it's kick the creeps where it hurts.

13:56.041 --> 13:58.041
-[rustling]
-Mountain crocs!

14:00.666 --> 14:03.000
[BTG gasps] A magnificent mountain nyala.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.541
[gasps] The final animal
on the parasite census!

14:05.625 --> 14:07.041
[groaning]

14:07.125 --> 14:09.833
Know what, Bonnie?
Why don't you take this one?

14:09.916 --> 14:11.291
No way!

14:11.375 --> 14:13.791
-[Bonnie] Ha-ha! Yes!
-Are you sure she can handle this?

14:13.875 --> 14:16.708
[inhales deeply] I'm sure. She's a Greive.

14:16.791 --> 14:20.166
She's a BTG. This is in her blood.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.125
[bellows softly]

14:25.666 --> 14:27.666
[screaming] Whoa!

14:29.416 --> 14:30.500
Whoa!

14:30.583 --> 14:32.458
-[thuds]
-[grunts] Ow!

14:32.541 --> 14:34.250
[grunts] Crap!

14:34.875 --> 14:35.708
I'm good.

14:35.791 --> 14:36.625
Attagirl!

14:37.375 --> 14:41.375
[sighing] Ah! I'm gonna be sad
when one of you gets killed and eaten.

14:41.916 --> 14:43.625
Mmm, hopefully in that order.

14:43.708 --> 14:44.708
[laughs]

14:44.791 --> 14:46.375
<i>Oh, Mother.</i>

14:49.666 --> 14:54.083
Even animals that traditionally hunt alone
can form unusual symbiotic partnerships…

14:54.166 --> 14:56.208
-[Bonnie] Uncle B. Gold.
-…with different species.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.375
-Found your yearbook.
-[BTG] Oh, is that gold, really?

14:58.458 --> 14:59.791
What were you like in high school?

14:59.875 --> 15:02.583
I was friends with a lot of kids
from a lot of different backgrounds.

15:02.666 --> 15:05.833
And when I started exploring the world,
those friendships paid off.

15:05.916 --> 15:07.958
I don't care about
those people cliques anymore.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.333
I'm more of an animal person now.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.291
But you gotta remember that, in nature,

15:11.375 --> 15:13.833
animals behave
much like we did in high school.

15:13.916 --> 15:15.916
They have their own cliques.
Like tortoises--

15:16.000 --> 15:17.500
-[Bonnie] Stoners.
-[BTG] Correct.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.666
Yaks? Jocks.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.291
The meathead jocks are the ones in the gym
just getting their beef on.

15:22.375 --> 15:23.541
-[Bonnie] Yeah.
-Wallabies?

15:23.625 --> 15:27.125
-Like the track team?
-[Bonnie] Oh, definitely. Porcupines?

15:27.208 --> 15:29.291
[BTG] They're like
the hardcore super virgins.

15:29.375 --> 15:30.208
Aah!

15:30.291 --> 15:33.333
-[laughs] He's back!
-Scorpions are goths.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.375
-[BTG] Uh-huh.
-Tarantulas, emo kids.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.541
-What's the difference? Ah.
-Eyeliner.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.625
-Zebra, thespians.
-[BTG] Drama club. Yeah.

15:40.708 --> 15:42.541
Oh. Vulture?

15:42.625 --> 15:45.250
A really mean principal,
and he hates the kids,

15:45.333 --> 15:46.708
because he hates his life.

15:46.833 --> 15:49.583
-Nature, high school, one and the same.
-[Bonnie] Yeah.
