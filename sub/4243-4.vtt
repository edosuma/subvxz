Too late. I saw them.

00:15.472 --> 00:17.189
Saw what?
Your free lunch tickets.

00:17.223 --> 00:18.223
Sucks being poor.

00:20.727 --> 00:23.345
Before the recession,
my mom was a real estate agent.

00:23.363 --> 00:24.363
Solid middle class.

00:24.397 --> 00:25.717
Now she's the only black waitress

00:25.718 --> 00:27.066
working at the Lima Country Club,

00:27.117 --> 00:28.617
taking orders from a bunch of

00:28.651 --> 00:30.519
rich old white guys who barely tip.

00:30.537 --> 00:32.296
And it kills me,
she's working extra shifts

00:32.298 --> 00:33.418
to pay for my dance lessons.

00:33.419 --> 00:35.624
Wait... you dance?

00:35.658 --> 00:36.938
Let's just keep that between us.

00:39.162 --> 00:41.547
Oh... young love.

00:41.581 --> 00:44.061
BLAINE: Do you remember when
you first started dating Santana

00:44.062 --> 00:45.102
and I started dating Kurt,

00:45.103 --> 00:48.703
back before everyone was
so busy and so... far away.

00:48.722 --> 00:50.539
Things were so much simpler.

00:50.557 --> 00:53.575
We had so much more hope and innocence.

00:53.610 --> 00:55.210
Every day was just like Valentine's Day.

00:55.211 --> 00:56.962
We're still young.

00:56.996 --> 00:59.064
Shouldn't we still be
experiencing those things?

01:09.442 --> 01:10.776
Hey.

01:10.827 --> 01:12.060
Somebody slept late.

01:12.078 --> 01:13.746
It's lunchtime.

01:13.780 --> 01:15.564
Do you want a Croque Madame?

01:15.582 --> 01:17.750
We didn't go to bed till late.

01:17.784 --> 01:19.618
Thank God for earplugs.

01:19.669 --> 01:21.829
I love you both but I don't
want to hear any of that.

01:21.830 --> 01:23.622
We didn't do anything.

01:23.673 --> 01:27.926
He didn't even talk to me,
we just, like, laid there.

01:30.463 --> 01:32.131
I'm gonna take this down to the park

01:32.182 --> 01:33.748
and watch drug deals go down.

01:33.767 --> 01:36.084
It's good to see you again, Finn.

01:36.102 --> 01:37.102
You, too, little brother.

01:37.103 --> 01:39.772
Um, so, are you hungry?

01:39.806 --> 01:41.089
Can I make you some eggs?

01:41.107 --> 01:42.941
Yeah. Thanks.

01:45.528 --> 01:47.529
Wow, this place is awesome.

01:47.564 --> 01:49.865
It's not the ideal neighborhood, but

01:49.899 --> 01:52.701
at least we can sort of see Manhattan.

01:55.705 --> 01:57.623
I can't do this, Finn.

01:57.657 --> 01:59.657
I don't understand.
I don't know what's going on.

01:59.658 --> 02:02.611
Why are you here and why aren't
you in your uniform?

02:02.629 --> 02:04.997
Because I'm not in the Army.

02:05.048 --> 02:08.167
Well, I was, for 16 days...

02:08.217 --> 02:09.501
(Drill Sergeant yelling)

02:09.551 --> 02:10.886
FINN: <i>It wasn't that bad.</i>

02:10.919 --> 02:12.320
<i>I really felt like I was someplace.</i>

02:12.321 --> 02:13.361
<i>I could make a difference,</i>

02:13.362 --> 02:15.002
<i>and I'm pretty used to getting yelled at,</i>

02:15.003 --> 02:16.124
<i>so I was doing okay.</i>

02:16.142 --> 02:17.702
<i>Then, one day, I was cleaning Rachel...</i>

02:17.736 --> 02:19.296
<i>they make you give your rifle a name...</i>

02:19.297 --> 02:19.812
(gunshot)

02:19.846 --> 02:21.180
Right through my thigh.

02:21.231 --> 02:22.731
Thank God it didn't hit any bone.

02:22.765 --> 02:26.018
I got a semi-honorable
discharge.

02:26.069 --> 02:28.136
So I've been backpacking through Georgia

02:28.154 --> 02:29.638
for the past couple months.

02:29.656 --> 02:31.523
I'm sorry I didn't call you, but...

02:31.574 --> 02:33.158
but I was just so embarrassed.

02:33.193 --> 02:36.495
I mean, I left with

02:36.529 --> 02:38.847
so much certainty and confidence.

02:38.882 --> 02:42.100
I was gonna redeem my dad
and make you proud.

02:44.587 --> 02:46.821
I couldn't face you
seeing me as a Lima loser.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.158
Enough of this...
enough lumping around.

02:50.176 --> 02:51.710
All right, so what?

02:51.761 --> 02:52.827
The Army didn't work out.

02:52.846 --> 02:54.096
Plans change.

02:54.130 --> 02:57.599
You're here now, with me, in...

02:57.634 --> 03:00.152
in the greatest city in the whole world

03:00.186 --> 03:02.170
and what a better place for you and I

03:02.188 --> 03:03.605
to find you a new dream.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.607
Like what? Before the Army,

03:05.642 --> 03:08.510
you applied to Pace to be an actor.

03:08.528 --> 03:11.947
You know, that was obviously
not the right school but...

03:11.981 --> 03:13.866
I don't know, maybe NYADA is.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.850
I mean, why don't you come with me

03:15.869 --> 03:17.536
to all of my classes this week,

03:17.570 --> 03:19.688
and if you love it,
then you can move in here

03:19.706 --> 03:22.190
and we'll spend the whole
year just finding a way

03:22.208 --> 03:23.625
for you to get in.

03:25.995 --> 03:27.713
You serious?

03:29.666 --> 03:33.535
I love it here, but something
has always been missing.

03:33.553 --> 03:37.339
I let you go once and I'm not
gonna let it happen again.

03:41.144 --> 03:45.564
I mean, I'm not jealous,
I just think that it's insane

03:45.598 --> 03:47.159
that all Porcelain had to do

03:47.160 --> 03:48.600
to get an internship
with Vogue.com

03:48.651 --> 03:51.153
is take photos of every ridiculous outfit

03:51.187 --> 03:52.821
he's ever paired with a Cossack hat,

03:52.855 --> 03:54.239
and a see-through raincoat

03:54.274 --> 03:56.057
and then show up at an interview

03:56.075 --> 03:58.727
where he is lauded as a visionary

03:58.745 --> 04:00.985
because his jodhpurs happened
to match his riding crop.

04:00.986 --> 04:02.986
Well, you know, you could
follow your dream, too.

04:02.987 --> 04:04.467
Your mom gave you that money and said

04:04.468 --> 04:06.228
you could go to New York,
too, iyou wanted.

04:06.229 --> 04:07.189
I like being in college.

04:07.190 --> 04:09.254
My schedule is crazy but I love being

04:09.289 --> 04:11.911
a cheerleader and I like the idea that

04:11.912 --> 04:13.792
I'm never more than
a few hours away from you.

04:13.843 --> 04:15.243
Can't you do laundry at school?

04:15.261 --> 04:17.678
Mm-mm. My first week there,
I heard a rumor

04:17.714 --> 04:19.630
that all the water in Louisville

04:19.682 --> 04:22.083
is just purified runoff from
the Kentucky Derby stables.

04:22.101 --> 04:23.302
Nasty. But...

04:23.353 --> 04:24.970
mo importantly, I promised myself that

04:25.021 --> 04:26.921
I would only do laundry at home, that way,

04:26.940 --> 04:28.857
no matter how busy I got,
I would be forced

04:28.891 --> 04:31.092
to come home every few weeks,

04:31.110 --> 04:32.644
and then I'd get to see you.

04:36.115 --> 04:37.599
Are you okay?

04:37.617 --> 04:38.767
Yeah, sorry.

04:38.785 --> 04:40.770
I was up late last night,

04:40.771 --> 04:42.771
reading <i>Desecration:</i>
<i>Antichrist Takes the Throne.</i>

04:42.789 --> 04:44.773
It's the ninth book in
the Left Behind series

04:44.791 --> 04:47.793
of the apocalyptic Christian
novels about the end times

04:47.827 --> 04:50.945
and the rise of the Antichrist,
who name is Nicolae Carpathia,

04:50.964 --> 04:53.048
or Barack Obama, depending on who you ask.

04:53.082 --> 04:55.617
Brit, those Left Behind books
are really intense.

04:55.635 --> 04:57.285
What teacher is making you read those?

04:57.303 --> 04:59.120
And don't tell me that
Mr. Schue is doing

04:59.138 --> 05:00.806
Christian music week.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.058
It's not a class,
it's an after-school club

05:03.092 --> 05:06.895
that Sam and Joe and Kitty
and Dottie Kazatori are in.

05:06.929 --> 05:08.296
And you should come tomorrow.

05:08.314 --> 05:09.648
Who's Dottie Kazatori?

05:09.682 --> 05:11.066
She's Tina's assistant.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.302
Everyone graduated and things got weird.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.305
(school bell ringing, phone buzzing)

05:17.323 --> 05:19.307
Hey, stranger.

05:19.325 --> 05:21.743
(phone ringing) Hey. Uh...

05:21.778 --> 05:23.161
Crap! Can you hold on
one second?

05:24.864 --> 05:26.704
Isabelle Wright's office.
How can I help you?

05:26.705 --> 05:28.394
Um, it's me, Kurt.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.035
(phone ringing) Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

05:30.086 --> 05:31.726
Uh, look, ve taken over Isabelle's phones

05:31.727 --> 05:33.647
for the week, and they
just won't stop ringing.

05:33.648 --> 05:34.862
It's... it's okay.

05:34.863 --> 05:37.343
If you want to call me back
later, we can talk then. I can't.

05:37.344 --> 05:38.904
Isabelle says we have to get the column

05:38.905 --> 05:40.345
on the Web site by midnight tonight.

05:40.380 --> 05:41.610
(phone ringing, Kurt groans)

05:41.611 --> 05:42.931
Look, I know this is frustrating.

05:42.965 --> 05:44.266
It's frustrating for me, too,

05:44.300 --> 05:45.934
and I don't want to miss our phone dates

05:45.968 --> 05:49.688
but, you know, this-this
could be a career for me.

05:49.722 --> 05:51.440
I get that; I-I do.

05:51.474 --> 05:52.724
I really get it.

05:52.775 --> 05:54.342
It's just...

05:54.360 --> 05:57.178
I... really miss you.

05:57.196 --> 05:59.281
A lot, okay?

05:59.315 --> 06:01.115
I miss talking to you
and I miss hugging you

06:01.116 --> 06:02.734
and I miss messing around with you...

06:02.785 --> 06:04.686
Me, too.

06:04.704 --> 06:06.738
But you're coming in two weeks, right?

06:06.789 --> 06:10.358
I know, but... what am I
supposed to do until then,

06:10.376 --> 06:11.910
just hold my breath?

06:11.961 --> 06:13.128
(phone ringing)

06:13.162 --> 06:15.747
Shoot. Joan Didion's calling.

06:15.798 --> 06:17.365
She always has the best gossip.

06:17.383 --> 06:19.367
Um, all right, I will call you or text you

06:19.385 --> 06:20.368
on a break, okay? Okay.

06:20.386 --> 06:22.054
Okay. I love you.

06:24.390 --> 06:26.725

<i>I've never seen her so alive.</i>

06:34.183 --> 06:36.268

06:38.071 --> 06:40.054
<i>I just wish I could find a place for me</i>

06:40.073 --> 06:41.907

09:39.252 --> 09:40.058
This amazing bar

09:40.059 --> 09:41.419
that all the NYADA students go to,

09:41.454 --> 09:42.954
and Friday nights are the best

09:43.005 --> 09:44.445
because everybody gets up and sings,

09:44.446 --> 09:45.846
and it's where we're going tonight,

09:45.847 --> 09:47.575
and it's gonna be great.

09:47.593 --> 09:50.912
So I have to dress up to
go to a karaoke bar?

09:50.930 --> 09:53.250
Come on, Finn, we'll let you
sing "Don't Stop Believin',"

09:53.251 --> 09:54.491
or something equally uplifting.

09:54.492 --> 09:55.452
I don't... I don't know.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.791
I'm so out of practice, I
haven't even sang in the shower

09:57.792 --> 09:59.437
since Nationals.

09:59.472 --> 10:00.472
(knocking on door)

10:03.309 --> 10:04.693
Surprise!

10:04.727 --> 10:05.944
Blaine!

10:05.978 --> 10:07.595
Hi.

10:07.613 --> 10:08.613
KURT: This is amazing!

10:08.648 --> 10:09.688
But I wasn't expecting you

10:09.689 --> 10:10.699
for another two weeks.

10:10.733 --> 10:12.333
I know, I just couldn't wait any longer.

10:12.334 --> 10:13.201
I miss you too much.

10:13.235 --> 10:15.153
Oh, I miss you, too.
So good to see you.

10:15.204 --> 10:16.655
Wait!
I can't believe you're here.

10:16.706 --> 10:17.706
I missed you so much. Hi.

10:17.707 --> 10:19.291
Hi. Oh, Finn!

10:19.325 --> 10:20.959
What are you doing here?

10:20.993 --> 10:23.662
I'm... not really sure
at the moment, but...

10:23.713 --> 10:25.630
It's fantastic...
we're all together here.

10:25.665 --> 10:27.132
Just like the good old days.

10:32.363 --> 10:34.398
(playing a mellow tune)

10:35.400 --> 10:36.433
You okay?

10:36.451 --> 10:38.101
You seem a little...

10:38.119 --> 10:39.620
I'm-I'm great.

10:39.654 --> 10:42.105
It was just a...
it was a rough flight.

10:42.123 --> 10:43.203
I had a middle seat because

10:43.204 --> 10:44.644
I booked the ticket
so last-minute.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.109
Well, I, for one, am glad you did.

10:46.127 --> 10:48.161
It's our first night out in New York.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.296
We'll never forget this.

10:51.049 --> 10:52.616
Uh, Coke and, uh...

10:52.634 --> 10:54.384
Oh, amaretto sour,
please... virgin.

10:54.419 --> 10:57.170
It's good. Hey, Finn, Rachel.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.338
Brody, hi.

10:58.389 --> 10:59.949
Hey, Brody, good to see you again, man.

10:59.950 --> 11:00.870
Yeah, you too, you too.

11:00.871 --> 11:03.460
So, how's the, uh,
visit been going so far?

11:03.478 --> 11:05.062
Amazing. I took him to school

11:05.096 --> 11:07.180
to get the full NYADA experience together.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.511
Cool. Well, in that case,
I hope you're singing tonight.

11:09.529 --> 11:10.809
You haven't really been to NYADA

11:10.810 --> 11:12.050
until you've sung at Callbacks.

11:12.051 --> 11:13.731
This is what I've been trying to tell him,

11:13.732 --> 11:15.252
and I really, really want him to sing.

11:15.270 --> 11:16.910
"Give Your Heart a Break" with me, but...

11:16.911 --> 11:18.659
But I'm not a student, so...

11:18.693 --> 11:21.161
Well, you're with Rachel,
which makes you honorary.

11:21.195 --> 11:23.075
And I'm buddies
with Pascal, the piano player.

11:23.076 --> 11:24.756
And the song works better as a duet, so...

11:24.757 --> 11:27.534
Well, why don't you guys sing it together?

11:27.585 --> 11:29.670
It's a NYADA tradition, right?
And you guys

11:29.704 --> 11:30.671
are both NYADA students.

11:30.705 --> 11:32.322
Finn.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.373
Yeah.

11:33.424 --> 11:35.208
All right, let's do it.

11:39.297 --> 11:41.264
I love you.

11:44.435 --> 11:45.802
Wish me luck.

11:48.106 --> 11:50.173
I'm so nervous.
It's my Off-Off Broadway debut.

11:50.191 --> 11:52.392
BRODY: It's all good.
I got your back.

17:07.458 --> 17:08.657
Oh, I wish you would have

17:08.675 --> 17:10.042
gotten up there and sang with me.

17:10.094 --> 17:11.928
Yeah, I just...
I don't fit in here.

17:11.963 --> 17:13.496
This place is just too big.

17:13.513 --> 17:14.597
It moves too fast.

17:14.632 --> 17:15.932
People are too talented.

17:15.967 --> 17:17.934
No. I felt that way
when I first moved here.

17:17.969 --> 17:20.002
Even in Ohio, I knew
you were meant for this.

17:20.021 --> 17:21.671
I'm just not.

17:21.689 --> 17:24.190
So, that was... moving.

17:24.224 --> 17:28.310
I guess I'm kind of
wondering why that was.

17:30.314 --> 17:34.517
Well, you know, I, uh...
I really missed you.

17:34.535 --> 17:35.952
I miss you, too.

17:35.987 --> 17:38.855
And I'm really glad that you're here.

17:38.873 --> 17:43.526
But you've been so emotional
and weirdly sad.

17:43.544 --> 17:46.713
Please stop pretending
that there's nothing wrong.

17:52.003 --> 17:54.771
I was with someone.

17:57.008 --> 18:00.376
So, are you sure you and that
Brody guy are just friends?

18:00.394 --> 18:02.896
Look, I told you, everything's...
Just, ple-please...

18:02.930 --> 18:04.647
don't lie to me.

18:06.067 --> 18:08.318
I couldn't get in touch with you, okay?

18:08.352 --> 18:10.219
I-I... you weren't
answering my calls

18:10.237 --> 18:11.404
or my text messages.

18:11.439 --> 18:12.570
I didn't know where you were

18:12.571 --> 18:14.491
or even if you were okay.
So you were with him.

18:14.525 --> 18:15.725
I kissed him, but that's it.

18:15.743 --> 18:17.303
Okay, and only just because you told me

18:17.304 --> 18:19.184
that you wanted me to be free.
I can't believe

18:19.185 --> 18:20.505
I even said that.
I'm so stupid.

18:20.506 --> 18:21.664
It was Sebastian, wasn't it?

18:21.699 --> 18:24.233
No, it... it wasn't Sebastian,

18:24.251 --> 18:25.452
but it doesn't...

18:25.503 --> 18:26.903
It didn't mean anything.

18:26.921 --> 18:29.238
It was just a hook-up, okay?
Who was it?

18:29.256 --> 18:30.856
It doesn't matter who it was with, Kurt.

18:30.857 --> 18:32.759
What matters is that I was by myself.

18:32.793 --> 18:34.577
I needed you.

18:34.595 --> 18:37.680
I needed you around,
and you weren't there.

18:37.715 --> 18:39.749
And I was lonely, and I'm...

18:39.767 --> 18:41.417
I'm really sorry.

18:41.435 --> 18:43.269
You don't think that I've been lonely?

18:43.304 --> 18:45.088
You don't think that I've had temptations?

18:45.106 --> 18:47.924
But I didn't act on it
because I knew what it meant.

18:47.942 --> 18:49.926
It meant something
horrible and awful and...

18:49.944 --> 18:51.928
I'm so sorry, Kurt.

KURT: You can't just run away.

21:16.178 --> 21:17.612
Dude, you totally spooked me.

21:17.647 --> 21:19.197
I thought I was the only one awake.

21:19.232 --> 21:21.683
Been waiting for somebody to come out.

21:21.717 --> 21:23.535
I was hoping it'd be Blaine.

21:23.569 --> 21:26.204
You guys okay?

21:27.740 --> 21:30.125
I kind of feel like I'm going to die.

21:30.159 --> 21:32.027
Guess I don't have to ask you

21:32.061 --> 21:33.511
what you're doing, apparently.

21:33.546 --> 21:35.130
I'll talk to her later about it.

21:35.164 --> 21:37.549
I... I just got
to get away for a bit.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.384
Six months ago, did you ever think

21:39.418 --> 21:41.253
that things would be like this?

21:43.222 --> 21:45.840
Sometimes, I miss high school, you know?

21:45.891 --> 21:48.260
Come on, give me a hug before I go.

21:58.771 --> 22:02.274
Do you want me to say anything to Rachel?

22:04.660 --> 22:06.244
No.

22:08.864 --> 22:12.033
(school bell ringing)

22:12.084 --> 22:15.188
Hi, Boobless. It is my duty
as a soldier of the Lord

22:15.189 --> 22:17.589
to invite you to McKinley's
newest and most important club,

22:17.590 --> 22:20.110
the Left Behind Club. Kitty thinks
the end of times is coming.

22:20.111 --> 22:22.511
It's a fact that the Book of
Revelations predicted Twitter.

22:22.524 --> 22:24.404
It's one of the seven
signs of the apocalypse,

22:24.430 --> 22:26.681
along with porn,
unexplainable weather anomalies,

22:26.716 --> 22:29.718
Martian rovers, Barney Frank,
the Middle East, and MSNBC.

22:29.769 --> 22:31.289
The Left Behind Club accepts everyone,

22:31.290 --> 22:33.690
even losers and lezzies, so
your whole Glee Club's invited.

22:33.724 --> 22:36.284
Well, you're welcome to join us
as long as you're not a Muslim.

22:36.285 --> 22:38.560
It's like Kirk Cameron said,
it's never too late...

22:38.611 --> 22:39.944
until it's too late.

22:39.979 --> 22:41.818
Okay, everybody, listen up.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.939
Y'all are sinners, and you
better get right with God

22:43.940 --> 22:45.940
toot sweet, because Jesus
just logged onto Orbitz

22:45.941 --> 22:47.901
and booked himself
a plane ticket back to Earth.

22:47.902 --> 22:49.422
See, he's got an awesome dad named God

22:49.423 --> 22:51.623
who's throwing him a bitchin'
party called Armageddon,

22:51.624 --> 22:53.625
where he's gonna get to
kick off his sandals

22:53.659 --> 22:55.877
dance a little bit,
judge the crap out of everybody.

22:55.911 --> 22:57.295
SANTANA: Hi. I have a question.

22:57.330 --> 22:59.639
What the hell are you talking about?
Um, the Rapture.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.800
When the end times come,
the true believers in Christ

23:01.801 --> 23:03.681
will be lifted up,
body and soul, into heaven,

23:03.682 --> 23:05.162
leaving everyone else to duke it out.

23:05.163 --> 23:06.537
What about those of us

23:06.555 --> 23:08.539
who are still on the fence
about all of this?

23:08.557 --> 23:11.426
I don't know what there is to be
on the fence about, Dottie.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.762
Sorry I made you come to this.

23:13.813 --> 23:16.598
That's okay.
You're half-Jewish, right?

23:16.649 --> 23:19.601
Mm-hmm. Does that mean you'll
float up to heaven at half speed?

23:19.652 --> 23:21.532
I just heard there's an
elderly Japanese woman

23:21.533 --> 23:22.987
who fell down in the bathroom.

23:23.022 --> 23:24.722
She doesn't speak English,

23:24.740 --> 23:27.275
and she needs your help.
I'll be right back.

23:27.326 --> 23:29.926
Santana, come on, we should help her.
SANTANA: No, wait, Brit...

23:29.927 --> 23:31.727
I'm pretty sure I know
what's going on here.

23:31.728 --> 23:32.781
Okay, everybody, let's go.

23:32.832 --> 23:34.449
Move it, move it, move it!

23:34.500 --> 23:36.584
What's everybody doing?

23:36.619 --> 23:38.620
JAKE: Fake Rapture.
It was Kitty's idea.

23:45.044 --> 23:47.979
I can't find any Japanese ladies.

23:48.013 --> 23:50.515
Hello? Where did everyone go?

23:50.549 --> 23:53.935
Oh, my God.

23:53.969 --> 23:56.438
We've been left behind.
We've been left behind.

23:56.472 --> 23:59.590
We've been left behind!

23:59.608 --> 24:02.477
That's what it feels like to be
left behind, Dottie Kazatori.

24:02.528 --> 24:05.096
JAKE: Kitty! This has
gone way too far, okay?

24:05.114 --> 24:07.598
(Dottie whimpering, mumbling)
Dottie seems... pretty damaged.

24:07.616 --> 24:08.783
(Dottie keening)

24:08.818 --> 24:11.035
MARLEY:
I think I'm gonna go, now.

24:11.070 --> 24:13.621
No! Wait. Please don't go.

24:13.656 --> 24:16.941
I just really don't like that Kitty girl.

24:16.959 --> 24:19.461
And... I can't believe you do.

24:21.163 --> 24:22.643
Brittany, can-can we
please go home?

24:22.678 --> 24:24.278
I don't think this club is good for you.

24:24.279 --> 24:25.800
I'm not leaving.

24:25.835 --> 24:28.052
Being left behind sucks.
It's just a stupid prank.

24:28.087 --> 24:30.388
You don't get it.
You me behind, and it hurt.

24:32.391 --> 24:34.823
(hyperventilating)

24:34.824 --> 24:36.144
That's exactly what it felt like.

24:38.431 --> 24:40.732
(school bell ringing)

24:40.766 --> 24:42.150
Oh, my God.

24:42.184 --> 24:43.568
(laughing)

24:43.602 --> 24:45.687
Hey, buddy. Hi.

24:45.738 --> 24:48.406
You look great.
Oh, it's good to see you.

24:48.441 --> 24:50.358
Wait, I don't...

24:50.409 --> 24:51.693
Hold on, I don't get it.

24:51.744 --> 24:54.078
What happened...
what happened to the Army?

24:54.113 --> 24:56.080
It... didn't work out.

24:56.115 --> 24:57.515
Okay.

24:57.550 --> 24:58.700
Well, um...

24:58.751 --> 25:00.502
when'd you get in?

25:00.536 --> 25:02.153
Have you spoken with Rachel?
She...

25:02.171 --> 25:04.005
She's been worried sick about you.

25:04.039 --> 25:07.375
It's so good to
see you, Mr. Shue.

25:07.426 --> 25:08.993
Can I talk to you about something?

25:09.011 --> 25:10.628
Yeah, of course.

25:14.049 --> 25:16.534
(stifled sob)

25:16.569 --> 25:18.086
(school bell ringing)

25:19.815 --> 25:22.549
(school bell ringing)

25:24.190 --> 25:26.074
Hey.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.642
Um, by the time I got up,

25:27.660 --> 25:28.911
you were already gone.

25:28.945 --> 25:30.812
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.698
Why'd you do that to him?

25:32.732 --> 25:34.199
I don't know.

25:34.250 --> 25:36.368
I just...

25:36.419 --> 25:38.420
There's no excuse.
He won't talk to me.

25:38.455 --> 25:40.706
I don't even know if we're broken up.

25:40.757 --> 25:41.990
Finn! Dude, what's up?

25:42.008 --> 25:43.658
I'm just passing through,

25:43.676 --> 25:45.344
visiting my mom and Burt,

25:45.378 --> 25:47.829
and Mr. Shue said I could
come by if I wanted.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.432
Finn Hudson in the house, yo!

25:50.467 --> 25:52.000
Do you know who that is?

25:52.018 --> 25:53.683
Oh! SAM: Listen up!
For all of you guys

25:53.684 --> 25:55.604
who don't know, this is
Finn Hudson right here.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.606
I thought you joined the Army!
I-I did, but...

25:57.640 --> 26:00.360
WILL: But things don't always work
out the way you planned them to.

26:00.361 --> 26:01.081
And I said to Finn

26:01.082 --> 26:03.442
the same thing I say everyone
who comes through this club:

26:03.443 --> 26:05.514
We're a family, and you're
always welcome here.

26:05.532 --> 26:08.233
Even if you just need to take a
break and think things through.

26:08.284 --> 26:11.236
In any case, we have a lot to do today.

26:11.287 --> 26:12.854
First order of business:

26:12.872 --> 26:14.712
Deciding what the fall
musical's going to be.

26:14.713 --> 26:15.690
(cheers) All right!

26:15.708 --> 26:17.409
So I'm passing out a list

26:17.460 --> 26:19.411
of possibilities. <i>Peter Pan?</i>

26:19.462 --> 26:20.746
<i>Fiorello?</i> What the heck?

26:20.797 --> 26:22.080
Unique wants to do <i>Hedwig.</i>

26:22.131 --> 26:23.691
Uh, Tina wants to do <i>Pacific Overtures,</i>

26:23.692 --> 26:25.634
<i>Miss Saigon,</i> and <i>Flower Drum Song.</i>

26:25.668 --> 26:27.028
The challenge is picking something

26:27.029 --> 26:28.589
that plays to our collective strengths,

26:28.590 --> 26:29.950
and that won't set off a firestorm

26:29.951 --> 26:31.511
in the community like <i>Rocky Horror</i> did.

26:31.512 --> 26:32.724
You should do <i>Grease.</i>

26:32.759 --> 26:33.976
<i>Grease?</i>

26:34.010 --> 26:35.235
I know it 'cause the song

26:35.236 --> 26:37.396
I auditioned for Glee Club
was from <i>Grease,</i> remember?

26:37.430 --> 26:38.981
Yeah. Guys like it.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.649
Girls like it.

26:40.683 --> 26:43.051
People like my mom like it.
It's about high school,

26:43.069 --> 26:44.386
and growing up, and...

26:44.404 --> 26:46.421
being true to yourself.

26:46.456 --> 26:47.739
Plus, the songs rock.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.057
The wisdom of Solomon...

26:49.075 --> 26:50.659
All right.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.661
<i>Grease</i> is the word.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.896
Yes! (cheering)

26:54.914 --> 26:56.281
Finn's back!

27:05.508 --> 27:07.426
What's that? Open it.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.961
Okay.

27:13.016 --> 27:14.576
I'm officially on the blue ribbon panel

27:14.577 --> 27:15.634
to improve arts education.

27:15.685 --> 27:17.269
Oh, my goodness!

27:17.303 --> 27:19.638
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Schuester
goes to Washington.

27:19.689 --> 27:21.440
Oh, congratulations! Thank you.

27:21.474 --> 27:22.348
Thank you. (giggling)

27:22.349 --> 27:24.109
And what would you say
about Miss Pillsbury

27:24.143 --> 27:25.527
also going to Washington?

27:25.562 --> 27:26.812
, my gosh, I'd love to.

27:26.863 --> 27:28.383
For like a long weekend, or something.

27:28.384 --> 27:29.344
That would be wonderful.

27:29.345 --> 27:30.866
No, like...
like for a few months.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.768
I want you to be there with me.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.605
(laughs nervously)

27:36.623 --> 27:38.707
What about my job?

27:38.741 --> 27:40.442
That's what a tenure's for.

27:40.460 --> 27:42.377
Your job will be waiting
when you get back.

27:42.412 --> 27:46.281
This is not that I'm
afraid of losing my job.

27:46.299 --> 27:48.333
This is that I like my job.

27:48.384 --> 27:50.502
Look, this isn't a permanent thing, Emma.

27:50.553 --> 27:52.471
It's like an extended vacation.
A sabbatical.

27:52.505 --> 27:53.785
Teachers take them all the time.

27:53.786 --> 27:55.290
I don't want a sabbatical.

27:55.308 --> 27:58.343
But I-I thought you
were supportive of this.

27:58.394 --> 28:00.354
I am, because I know how
much this means to you,

28:00.355 --> 28:01.630
but this is for you.

28:01.664 --> 28:03.298
I didn't know you just expected me

28:03.316 --> 28:05.300
to drop my entire life.

28:05.318 --> 28:06.801
Emma, I love you.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.353
You're my fiancée.

28:08.404 --> 28:10.164
All I'm saying is,
I don't want to be alone

28:10.165 --> 28:11.690
and not be with you.

28:11.741 --> 28:14.101
And I don't want to sit alone
in some hotel room somewhere

28:14.102 --> 28:16.342
doing nothing, while you're off
fulfilling your dreams.

28:18.581 --> 28:21.583
You know, I don't think
what I'm asking is so crazy.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.585
I thought you'd be excited.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.300
So you thought I'd just pop the champagne,

28:25.301 --> 28:27.421
follow you around like an
obedient little puppy dog?

28:27.455 --> 28:29.095
Is that really all you think of me, Will?

28:29.096 --> 28:30.676
No, of course not, Emma.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.661
Oh, come on, we still
need to talk about this.

28:32.679 --> 28:33.995
We just did.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.098
You just don't like what I have to say.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.719
(distant phone ringing)

28:52.015 --> 28:54.015
Well, someone's either
seriously crushing on you,

28:54.016 --> 28:55.856
or seriously trying to
make up for something.

28:55.857 --> 28:57.035
The latter.

28:57.070 --> 28:59.371
Ouch. He cute?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.523
The cutest.

29:01.541 --> 29:03.008
Oh, that sucks. I'm sorry.

29:03.042 --> 29:05.043
Hey, you need to
go binge-shopping?

29:05.078 --> 29:06.998
Isabelle's summoning us
to the conference room.

29:06.999 --> 29:08.630
I can cover for you.

29:08.665 --> 29:10.031
I'm okay.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.551
I'll be okay.

29:18.169 --> 29:20.671
(school bell ringing)

29:21.789 --> 29:24.208
You wanted to see me?

29:25.593 --> 29:28.595
Sophomore year I used
to sit in this back row,

29:28.630 --> 29:30.180
and secretly watch you.

29:30.215 --> 29:33.433
I counted the number of times
you'd smile at me,

29:33.468 --> 29:35.802
and I'd die on days that you didn't.

29:37.021 --> 29:38.388
I miss this place so much.

29:38.439 --> 29:40.390
It's where we fell in love.

29:40.441 --> 29:42.676
Where I could say things with music,

29:42.694 --> 29:44.678
when words just weren't enough.

29:44.696 --> 29:46.196
And I need to tell you something

29:46.231 --> 29:48.682
that I don't know how to say.

Sad songs make me really sad,

32:11.709 --> 32:13.326
and I don't want to be sad.

32:13.344 --> 32:15.495
I haven't been a good girlfriend to you.

32:15.513 --> 32:18.065
I can't come home on the weekends and

32:18.099 --> 32:19.999
pretend that things are the way they were,

32:20.018 --> 32:21.218
because they aren't.

32:22.387 --> 32:24.003
And I don't want to be like

32:24.022 --> 32:26.273
all of those other
long-distance relationships,

32:26.307 --> 32:29.276
that, you know, hang in there
for a few months, and then...

32:29.310 --> 32:32.279
break up when someone eventually
cheats or things get weird.

32:32.313 --> 32:34.531
I would never cheat on you.

32:34.565 --> 32:36.733
I know.

32:36.784 --> 32:39.018
I know, and I would
never cheat on you, either,

32:39.037 --> 32:42.739
but... if we're being
completely honest,

32:42.790 --> 32:44.124
I had, well, I guess

32:44.158 --> 32:46.710
the best way to describe it would be...

32:46.744 --> 32:48.712
an energy exchange?

32:48.746 --> 32:52.365
SANTANA: <i>I was cramming for this
really boring sociology class,</i>

32:52.383 --> 32:55.435
<i>and I looked up, and this girl</i>
<i>was staring at me.</i>

32:55.470 --> 32:57.484
<i>She smiled a little too long,</i>

32:57.485 --> 32:58.805
<i>which means she was either crazy,</i>

32:58.840 --> 33:00.774
<i>or a lesbian.</i>

33:00.808 --> 33:03.593
<i>And judging by the stack of</i>
<i>Virginia Woolf she was reading,</i>

33:03.644 --> 33:05.762
<i>she was into me.</i>
<i>So I smiled back.</i>

33:05.813 --> 33:07.431
I had an attraction.

33:07.482 --> 33:08.899
And you,

33:08.933 --> 33:11.401
you may have had one
or you might have one,

33:11.436 --> 33:13.520
and that happens.

33:15.490 --> 33:18.825
Let's just do the mature thing here, okay?

33:18.860 --> 33:20.777
This is not an official breakup,

33:20.828 --> 33:23.113
but let's just be honest that

33:23.164 --> 33:27.584
long-distance relationships are
almost impossible to maintain.

33:27.618 --> 33:30.236
Because both people are rarely

33:30.254 --> 33:31.838
getting what they need,

33:31.873 --> 33:34.541
especially at our age.

33:37.545 --> 33:40.680
(sniffles) This sounds a
lot like a breakup to me.

33:40.715 --> 33:42.215
You know this isn't working.

33:44.469 --> 33:48.355
You know I will always love you the most.

33:58.483 --> 34:00.150
I love you, too.

34:00.201 --> 34:01.368
(school bell ringing)

34:07.342 --> 34:09.458
I'm sorry about the Left Behind club.

34:09.476 --> 34:10.844
That's Kitty's thing, not mine.

34:10.895 --> 34:12.846
I just don't get it.

34:12.897 --> 34:15.514
I don't get why someone like
you is with someone like Kitty.

34:15.565 --> 34:18.185
What do you mean, someone like me?
You act like you don't care

34:18.235 --> 34:21.471
what anyone thinks, but you
obviously are just as desperate

34:21.489 --> 34:23.639
to fit in as everyone
else if you'll date her.

34:23.658 --> 34:26.409
You don't know how it feels
to really be on the outside.

34:26.436 --> 34:29.356
The blacks kids think I'm too white;
The white kids think I'm too black.

34:29.373 --> 34:31.333
Kitty's funny and hot,
and yeah, a little crazy,

34:31.335 --> 34:32.574
but you know what, she likes me

34:32.576 --> 34:33.583
and when I'm next to her,

34:33.618 --> 34:35.918
no one makes fun of me

34:35.953 --> 34:37.152
for once.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.255
What's happening here?

34:38.289 --> 34:39.609
You coveting my man,
itty-bitty?

34:39.610 --> 34:41.875
Kitty, come on, ease up.

34:41.926 --> 34:44.126
I heard they're opening up
a new Ronald McDonald House

34:44.128 --> 34:45.967
in Lima just for you
and your finger-licking,

34:45.969 --> 34:47.809
lard-loving,
Gilbert-Grape-looking mama. Hey!

34:47.810 --> 34:49.382
That's enough.

34:49.434 --> 34:50.550
I'm sorry, or what?

34:50.601 --> 34:52.335
Or I'm breaking up with you.

34:52.353 --> 34:54.054
You do not want to break up with me, okay?

34:54.105 --> 34:56.344
I am like a bad Carrie Underwood
song once I get going.

34:56.346 --> 34:58.275
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.

34:58.309 --> 34:59.943
We're done.

35:00.812 --> 35:02.195
You did this.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.830
Well, you're both gonna regret this turn

35:03.831 --> 35:06.066
of events because I will
tell you one more thing.

35:06.117 --> 35:09.453
Obama's gonna lose.

35:10.988 --> 35:12.205
(screams)

35:13.207 --> 35:15.191
Thank you.

35:15.209 --> 35:16.693
You didn't have to do that.

35:16.711 --> 35:19.246
Actually, I think I did.

35:19.297 --> 35:22.382
Hey, do you want to go through
sheet music for <i>Grease?</i>

35:22.417 --> 35:23.917
I was thinking of auditioning

35:23.968 --> 35:25.069
for Sandy, and I think

35:25.070 --> 35:26.470
you'd be really great...
Actually,

35:26.504 --> 35:27.471
I have to go.

35:27.505 --> 35:29.222
But I'll see you later

35:29.257 --> 35:30.874
in Glee Club, okay?

35:30.892 --> 35:32.893
Okay.

35:36.063 --> 35:38.348
(school bell ringing)

35:43.770 --> 35:45.988
(footsteps approaching)

35:52.144 --> 35:54.112
This is where you proposed to me.

35:54.146 --> 35:57.032
When you did, you reminded me it
was where we had our first date.

35:57.083 --> 35:59.818
It's also where we first met.

36:01.838 --> 36:03.655
Do you remember that?

36:03.690 --> 36:06.592
Yeah, glee rehearsal.

36:06.626 --> 36:09.294
You, uh, you really freaked me out.

36:11.998 --> 36:14.132
This place is kind of like our Jerusalem.

36:14.166 --> 36:16.167
All roads seem

36:16.185 --> 36:19.137
to just lead us back here.

36:19.171 --> 36:22.558
I went to your house

36:22.609 --> 36:24.276
and to the tire shop.

36:24.310 --> 36:28.013
I should have known you
would've just been here though.

36:28.031 --> 36:29.898
I know it sounds kind of weird,

36:29.949 --> 36:31.950
but I just felt like singing up here.

36:31.985 --> 36:35.070
Seems to have helped me
figure out stuff before, so...

36:35.121 --> 36:37.522
Yeah, I would have just,
you know, come here first,

36:37.540 --> 36:39.141
if you would have picked up your phone

36:39.175 --> 36:41.109
or answered my text messages.

36:41.144 --> 36:43.612
Instead I had to get on a
plane and drive around town,

36:43.646 --> 36:45.330
looking for you, like an idiot.

36:45.365 --> 36:46.965
I'm sorry.
I just needed time to think.

36:46.966 --> 36:48.634
You had four months.

36:48.668 --> 36:51.003
I hated you for what you did
to me at that train station.

36:51.037 --> 36:53.038
I was trying to help you.
I hated you.

36:53.056 --> 36:56.675
But then when I got to
New York, I thought how much

36:56.709 --> 36:58.677
you love me

36:58.711 --> 37:00.545
and how hard that must have been for you.

37:00.563 --> 37:02.314
And I thought,

37:02.348 --> 37:04.316
this...

37:04.350 --> 37:07.319
this is what a man looks like.

37:07.353 --> 37:10.389
This is how a man loves.

37:11.658 --> 37:13.275
But you...

37:13.326 --> 37:16.945
not telling me where you were
for four months

37:16.996 --> 37:18.276
and sneaking out before sunrise,

37:18.277 --> 37:20.397
in the middle of the night,
without saying good-bye,

37:20.398 --> 37:22.233
that is not being a man, Finn.

37:22.251 --> 37:23.691
I'm trying to give you your freedom!

37:23.692 --> 37:25.252
I don't need you to give me my freedom!

37:25.253 --> 37:26.872
I am a grown woman.

37:26.906 --> 37:29.074
I don't need you to hide from me,

37:29.092 --> 37:31.076
to keep me from doing
what is right for me.

37:31.094 --> 37:32.377
Like that Brody guy?

37:32.411 --> 37:35.631
I didn't do Brody, okay?

37:35.682 --> 37:38.350
And don't you think that I would
have rather have been with you?

37:38.384 --> 37:40.636
Well, didn't you say he was on Broadway?

37:40.687 --> 37:42.727
Right? And he's got,
like, three-percent body fat.

37:42.728 --> 37:43.472
Who am I?

37:43.523 --> 37:45.090
I barely even graduated high school,

37:45.108 --> 37:47.092
and my life has absolutely

37:47.110 --> 37:48.827
no direction.

37:48.861 --> 37:50.646
Don't you get it?

37:50.697 --> 37:53.198
No matter how rich

37:53.232 --> 37:56.318
or famous or successful I become,

37:56.369 --> 37:59.705
when it comes to you,

37:59.739 --> 38:02.824
I'm...

38:02.875 --> 38:06.662
I'm always gonna be
that moon-eyed girl

38:06.713 --> 38:09.948
who freaked you out at
our first glee rehearsal.

38:11.617 --> 38:14.052
You were the first boy

38:14.087 --> 38:16.555
who made me feel loved

38:16.589 --> 38:19.224
and sexy

38:19.258 --> 38:21.927
and visible.

38:23.813 --> 38:27.065
You are my first love.

38:27.100 --> 38:30.135
And...

38:30.153 --> 38:34.606
I want, more than anything,

38:34.640 --> 38:37.743
for you to be my last.

38:40.747 --> 38:43.749
But I can't do this anymore.

38:46.335 --> 38:48.336
At least, not now.

38:50.289 --> 38:52.541
We're done.

38:52.592 --> 38:54.593
Wow.

38:57.597 --> 38:59.548
What am I gonna do with my life?

38:59.599 --> 39:01.666
I don't have my girl, I don't have a job,

39:01.684 --> 39:03.935
I don't have a place in this world.

39:03.970 --> 39:07.005
You have you.

39:08.808 --> 39:10.842
And that's better than
anyone else on the planet,

39:10.860 --> 39:12.644
as far as I'm concerned.

39:18.484 --> 39:20.018
