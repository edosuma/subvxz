WEBVTT

00:03.471 --> 00:06.540
I'll take that, take
that and I'll take that.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.408
(laughs)

00:07.441 --> 00:10.411
Ray, why is everybody
giving you mo...?

00:10.444 --> 00:12.580
Oh, my God, did you win
the celebrity death pool?

00:12.613 --> 00:13.614
(laughs)

00:13.647 --> 00:15.749
Is Jason Bateman dead?
Oh, no.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.385
(laughing):
No.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.820
Nah.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.822
People are going in
on a group wedding gift

00:21.855 --> 00:23.257
for Andrew in accounting.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.626
Wait a sec,
and-and you're all invited?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.361
Why... why wouldn't I
be invited?

00:27.395 --> 00:28.662
I'll tell you, but first,

00:28.696 --> 00:30.564
could you grab me
another creamer?

00:30.598 --> 00:31.732
(grunts)

00:36.270 --> 00:40.274
That's why you weren't invited.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.675
Why, 'cause I got you
the wrong creamer?

00:41.709 --> 00:42.710
What are you, back on soy?

00:42.743 --> 00:44.212
I thought you were worried
about growing man-boobs.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.214
No. I'm talking
about poor Kevin.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.149
You didn't even stop
to say hi to him.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.084
You just gave him
a walk-n-wave.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.285
It makes people
think that you think

00:51.319 --> 00:52.286
you're better than them.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.287
Are you kidding?!

00:53.321 --> 00:55.656
Come on, I don't think
that I'm better than...

00:55.689 --> 00:59.327
God, this is a terrible time
not to remember his name.

00:59.360 --> 01:04.665
And you just said it, too.
Was it... was it Creamer?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.634
Look, if you want people
to think differently,

01:06.667 --> 01:07.801
you got to stop
doing walk-n-waves

01:07.835 --> 01:09.603
and start doing
stop-n-chats.

01:09.637 --> 01:10.771
What's a "stop-n-chat?"

01:10.804 --> 01:12.506
What's it sound like?

01:12.540 --> 01:14.542
(laughs)
You stop and chat.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.810
Two questions, a joke
and you're out of there.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.612
Watch a pro.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.148
Hey, Kevin!
Big plans for the weekend?

01:20.181 --> 01:21.815
(laughs)
Oh, probably just
hang out at home,

01:21.849 --> 01:22.883
work on my...
(imitates record scratching)

01:22.916 --> 01:24.452
deejaying.
(imitates record scratching)

01:24.485 --> 01:25.453
(both laugh)

01:25.486 --> 01:26.887
You gonna watch the game?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.589
Uh, yeah. On my new
65-inch flat-screen.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.258
65 inches?!

01:30.291 --> 01:31.492
(whoops)

01:31.525 --> 01:33.361
Son, that game gonna
watch you, baby!

01:33.394 --> 01:34.428
(both laughing)

01:34.462 --> 01:35.463
"Watch me."
(both laughing)

01:35.496 --> 01:36.697
That's what I'm saying!

01:38.632 --> 01:40.668
Now, that's how you make friends

01:40.701 --> 01:41.669
around the office.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.437
Now, get my creamer.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.472
(whoops)

02:08.729 --> 02:11.599
So you didn't get invited
to a wedding. Who cares?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.202
I'll make a cake
and we can do the Chicken Dance.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.770
And if I get drunk enough,

02:16.804 --> 02:19.240
I'll probably even
throw a garter at you.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.743
It's not that I didn't get
invited to the wedding, Mom.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.713
It's that I didn't get invited
because everyone thinks

02:25.746 --> 02:27.881
that I think
that I'm better than they are.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.318
Of course, I'm sure
you are better than them.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.685
Would you stop it?
The only reason

02:31.719 --> 02:33.221
you're saying that
is 'cause you're my mom.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.190
No. I simply have a
realistic view of the world.

02:36.224 --> 02:39.693
I'd never tell your sister
she's better than other people.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.762
I mean, she's better
than some people.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.664
Eh...

02:43.697 --> 02:45.599
Mom, nobody is better
than anyone else.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.601
Oh, please, we
rank everything.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.869
What's the best restaurant.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.271
What's the fastest car.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.872
Which president
was the hottest.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.341
Kennedy had the looks,

02:53.374 --> 02:54.808
but I'd go with
Clinton in the sack.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.644
So, why can't
we rank people

02:56.677 --> 02:59.413
so we know who deserves
our attention?

02:59.447 --> 03:01.749
Because it sounds evil.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.418
Oh. Oh, stop being so dramatic.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.886
It's the way of the world.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.756
Think about when you were a kid
and we'd go to the store.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.892
We'd always stop and talk
to the Bradshaws

03:11.925 --> 03:14.562
because they had
a trampoline in their backyard,

03:14.595 --> 03:16.730
but we'd just give a quick wave
to the Thompsons

03:16.764 --> 03:19.867
because they had a trampoline
in their front yard.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.735
Yeah, I remember that, and we...

03:21.769 --> 03:23.704
we barely waved at all
to the Bowdens.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.706
Yeah, that's because
they had a car door

03:25.739 --> 03:27.875
that was made
entirely of duct tape.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.379
Oh, my God.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.281
You're the one who
made me this way.

03:33.314 --> 03:36.250
You raised me
to walk-n-wave.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.852
I raised you to know
your place in the world.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.787
You're welcome.
No-no-no.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.290
I don't think I'm better
than anyone else.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.491
I have to undo this.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.959
Tomorrow, I am gonna stop
and chat with everyone I see.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.562
Even that blind janitor
I usually tiptoe around.

03:48.596 --> 03:52.232
I'm ashamed to say we once
shared a large bathroom stall.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.771
He still doesn't know.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.745
Mom, can you help me
with my math homework?

04:04.778 --> 04:09.383
I want to get good with numbers
in case my looks fade.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.418
Yeah, sorry, honey.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.753
I have to go teach
my "Yoga in the Dark" class.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.323
It's for large women
who refuse to wear yoga pants

04:15.356 --> 04:16.590
in the light of day.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.292
Plus, I have to stop on the way

04:18.326 --> 04:19.927
and pick up
the motivational pizzas.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.830
You should go
ask Grandpa.

04:24.798 --> 04:25.833
Hey.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.835
Why would you send her upstairs
to talk to Grandpa

04:27.868 --> 04:28.769
when I'm sitting right here?

04:28.802 --> 04:30.938
Um, sweetie,
when it comes to academics,

04:30.971 --> 04:34.508
I think, because you were
homeschooled, on a commune,

04:34.542 --> 04:36.744
by a teacher named Strawberry,

04:36.777 --> 04:39.680
there might be some gaps
in your education.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.849
Like what?
K through 12.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.084
Look, for Mikayla's
homework,

04:44.117 --> 04:45.786
I just think Dad's better
qualified to help her.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.656
Wait a second, there is no way
your dad is smarter than me.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.890
Adam, he was an engineer.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.459
Okay, you know what,
people keep saying that,

04:51.492 --> 04:53.394
but I have never seen Tom
the engineer; I've only seen

04:53.427 --> 04:55.363
Tom, the guy who gets his head
stuck in the mailbox.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.798
I ordered a bust
of Mark Twain

04:57.831 --> 04:59.500
and wanted to see
if it would fit.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.435
By the way,

05:01.469 --> 05:03.771
we owe the mailman
a tube of ChapStick.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.575
He used his to grease my ears
and slide me out.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.211
Dad, he didn't mean...

05:11.244 --> 05:14.014
And at least I'm smart enough
not to talk about people

05:14.047 --> 05:15.583
when they're in the room.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.117
I'm sorry, Tom.
I didn't mean you're not smart.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.886
Oh, good,
because it's preposterous

05:18.919 --> 05:20.688
that you would think
you're smarter than me.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.723
(laughing):
I'm not sure that I would say

05:22.756 --> 05:23.957
"it's preposterous."

05:23.991 --> 05:26.960
No. They probably didn't use
words that big on the commune.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.464
Stop.
This is not a competition,

05:30.498 --> 05:32.533
and insults are not the way
to prove who's smarter.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.601
No, you're right, honey.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.636
We should take an IQ test.
I'm game.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.871
Deb, find a test online.

05:37.905 --> 05:38.872
I'll get my slide rule.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.974
I'll find my brain crystals
and thinking candle.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.615
So, you know...

05:47.648 --> 05:48.982
Oh, there's Doug.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.818
He's perfect
for the stop-n-chat.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.920
If you want people to think
you're down to earth,

05:52.953 --> 05:54.722
let them see you
talking to Doug.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.056
Just be prepared--
he's the kind of guy

05:56.089 --> 05:57.658
that butters both
sides of the bagel.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.660
If you know what
I mean. (laughs)

05:59.693 --> 06:00.861
I-I-I... I do not.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.763
He puts butter on both
sides of the bagel.

06:02.796 --> 06:03.764
It's odd.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.999
Hey, Doug Dynasty.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.901
What kind of potato chips today?

06:07.935 --> 06:09.136
Barbecue.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.004
Sour cream and onion
are my favorite,

06:11.038 --> 06:14.942
but I didn't feel like I
deserved my favorite today.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.910
Well, you know who's all
that and a bag of chips?

06:16.944 --> 06:18.746
My boy, Nathan.
(laughs)

06:18.779 --> 06:20.948
I'm going to lunch.
You got this.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.550
Two questions and a joke.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.719
Hey, man.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.089
So, Doug...
(sighs)

06:29.122 --> 06:30.458
Doug-out...

06:32.626 --> 06:35.596
Doug, Doug, goose.
(laughs)

06:36.930 --> 06:38.932
You got big plans
for the weekend?

06:38.966 --> 06:40.668
You gonna... you gonna
watch the game?

06:40.701 --> 06:42.736
(laughing):
No. To be honest, uh,

06:42.770 --> 06:43.904
I'm thinking about embarking

06:43.937 --> 06:45.573
on one of life's
greatest adventures.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.141
Gonna propose to my girlfriend.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.643
Just kind of sucks,

06:49.677 --> 06:50.911
'cause I don't really have

06:50.944 --> 06:52.913
anyone to talk to about it.
(sighs)

06:52.946 --> 06:54.848
Kind of a serious subject
to make a joke about.

06:54.882 --> 06:55.849
Um... okay.

06:55.883 --> 06:59.052
Well, uh... (sighs)

06:59.086 --> 07:00.053
Let's talk about it.
(laughs)

07:00.087 --> 07:02.155
Oh, yeah, right.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.858
Like you could understand
my problems.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.060
You're a fancy TV reporter.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.998
I bet you don't even
have one loose tooth.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.500
(laughing): No.
(scoffs)

07:12.533 --> 07:15.002
Doug, you and I
are exactly the same.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.003
Come on, so, uh...

07:16.036 --> 07:17.738
you, um...

07:17.771 --> 07:19.172
(clears throat)
you picked out a ring yet?

07:19.206 --> 07:21.208
No, I don't have any money.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.076
Well, don't let that stop you.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.113
I mean, you-you've got love
and-and boyish good looks

07:26.146 --> 07:28.749
and a real interesting
Pacman watch.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.983
And...

07:30.017 --> 07:31.184
Oh, that's who that is.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.022
Look, I'm sure you'll...
you'll figure it out.

07:35.055 --> 07:39.159
Well, I do have a ring
of my grandmother's, but...

07:39.192 --> 07:40.928
it's kind of complicated

07:40.961 --> 07:43.697
'cause my mom
doesn't like my girlfriend.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.032
You know how moms can be.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.935
Yeah, I do know how moms can be.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.970
Mine lives with me.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.104
What?!

07:51.138 --> 07:53.674
Nate Miller lives with his mom?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.576
Doug Dascal lives
with his mom, too.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.911
Who's Doug Dascal?

07:57.945 --> 08:00.080
Me.

08:00.113 --> 08:00.948
(laughing):
Yes!

08:00.981 --> 08:03.951
Of course it is,
but I mean, you know,

08:03.984 --> 08:05.553
who is Doug Dascal?

08:06.854 --> 08:08.221
The man...
D-Don't tell me now.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.791
Listen, I'm not gonna tell you
how to live your life.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.025
But-but I am gonna
tell you that

08:12.059 --> 08:13.961
you can't let your mom
live it for you.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.629
So if... if you want
to propose to your girlfriend,

08:15.663 --> 08:16.664
propose to your girlfriend.

08:16.697 --> 08:20.133
You know what? I will.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.903
This has been
really helpful.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.038
Thanks so much, Nate.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.807
Oh, no thanks needed--
just one guy

08:26.840 --> 08:28.008
stopping and chatting
with another.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.042
(both laughing)

08:29.076 --> 08:30.711
Oh.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.079
You're not the
standoffish turd

08:32.112 --> 08:33.246
that everyone
says you are.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.915
(laughing)

08:34.948 --> 08:35.983
NATHAN:
Oh, wait.

08:36.016 --> 08:36.984
Hang on a second.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.118
The lunch rush is coming.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.087
Oh, okay.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.990
Okay...

08:43.023 --> 08:46.827
I got your IQ test scores
back from the Web site.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.829
Sorry for the delay.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.631
(clears throat)

08:50.664 --> 08:51.732
(sighs)

08:51.765 --> 08:54.001
Uh, Adam, I also got back
our free credit report,

08:54.034 --> 08:55.135
and let's just say,
uh, after this

08:55.168 --> 08:57.237
is done, we've got a much
bigger issue to deal with.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.039
(Debbie clears throat)

08:59.072 --> 09:02.142
So, Adam, this is you.
Okay.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.812
Oh, my God. This is horrible!

09:04.845 --> 09:06.013
(laughing)

09:06.046 --> 09:07.948
That's got to sting, dummy.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.016
You know what?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.584
You can't trust these
stupid standardized tests.

09:10.618 --> 09:11.585
They're notoriously biased.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.586
You won, honey.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.855
Biased towards smart people.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.256
Wait a minute.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.092
Let me see those scores.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.127
This is impossible.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.962
29th percentile?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.064
Dad, I mean, I get how
some of these categories

09:24.097 --> 09:26.667
might not be your strengths,
like composition and rhetoric,

09:26.700 --> 09:27.768
but math and science?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.770
You were an engineer
for 35 years.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.872
I don't know what happened.
I'm old.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.040
Ah, don't worry about it, Tom.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.175
At least you're the second
smartest guy in this house.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.910
Oh, actually, Deb, um,

09:36.944 --> 09:39.346
is Mikayla's goldfish
a boy or a girl?

09:39.379 --> 09:41.148
It's a girl, you idiot.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.783
Have you ever seen its weiner?

09:46.720 --> 09:49.056
No, Mom, I'm not going
to let you ruin this for me.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.924
Okay? I-I-I helped out
a coworker today,

09:50.958 --> 09:52.793
and it felt great,
and it's opened up

09:52.826 --> 09:54.194
a whole new world for me.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.129
Well, that is a world
that's not meant to be open.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.099
There's a natural order to life
that must not be disturbed.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.101
I mean, haven't you ever seen
Jurassic Park?

10:01.134 --> 10:03.937
Wait, how can you compare humans

10:03.971 --> 10:05.372
genetically engineering
dinosaurs

10:05.405 --> 10:06.439
to me helping out a coworker?

10:06.473 --> 10:09.342
Because Dougs in cubicles
and Nathans on camera

10:09.376 --> 10:11.011
aren't meant to coexist.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.212
(knocking on door)

10:12.245 --> 10:13.180
Mom, you are wrong.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.182
You should have seen
the look on Doug's face.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.750
All it took was
five minutes of my time.

10:16.784 --> 10:17.818
I changed his life forever.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.022
(crying):
She said no.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.892
I proposed and she said no.

10:24.925 --> 10:28.361
My life is ruined!

10:28.395 --> 10:31.098
(deep voice):
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.875
Look, Doug, I know you're upset,
but you'll be okay.

10:41.909 --> 10:45.078
Any woman that turns you down
doesn't deserve you.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.147
This is the worst day
of my life.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.982
And I've had a
punctured rectum,

10:49.016 --> 10:50.984
so you can imagine
how bad today is.

10:54.087 --> 10:57.024
Was it recent? 'Cause I could
put a towel under you.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.761
I gave her my grandmother's
ring, like you said.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.230
I thought it would be romantic
to ask her at work,

11:03.263 --> 11:06.333
but she said no, and then we
fought in front of everybody,

11:06.366 --> 11:08.368
and I left
without getting the ring.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.103
(gasps)

11:10.137 --> 11:12.372
My mom is going to kill me.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.774
Aah!

11:13.807 --> 11:16.443
(muffled crying)

11:16.476 --> 11:18.345
Listen, listen, uh, Doug,

11:18.378 --> 11:19.346
Doug, come on.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.081
The-the-the...
the measure of a man

11:21.114 --> 11:24.017
is not how he acts
in times of success,

11:24.051 --> 11:27.154
but how he responds
in times of adversity.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.490
That's so beautiful.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.326
Oh, Nate, I wish
I'd had you there.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.128
Maybe things would have
turned out differently.

11:35.162 --> 11:38.098
Listen, you got to come
down there and talk to her.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.400
Maybe she'll reconsider.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.369
Uh, Nathan, can I talk to you
in the kitchen?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.037
I-I-I need your
long thumbs

11:44.071 --> 11:47.374
to help me open something
that requires, uh, long thumbs.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.310
Excuse me one-one second.

11:50.343 --> 11:54.114
Okay, I'll just wait here
with my stupid short thumbs.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.351
(whispering):
Get him out!

11:58.385 --> 12:00.153
Get him out now!

12:00.187 --> 12:02.222
He's a social grenade.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.757
Throw him out the window

12:03.791 --> 12:05.425
and let him destroy
somebody else's life!

12:05.458 --> 12:07.360
Look, Mom, I can't do that.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.262
I'm the one
that pulled the pin!

12:09.296 --> 12:10.898
I warned you about this!

12:10.931 --> 12:12.499
You can't lift
somebody like him up.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.434
He can only drag you down!

12:14.467 --> 12:17.170
You got to cut him loose!

12:17.204 --> 12:19.306
No. Mom, listen,
I don't want to be that guy.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.408
Besides, everybody saw me
hugging him today at lunch.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.776
I can't cut him loose,

12:22.810 --> 12:24.444
because I'll never
get invited to a wedding,

12:24.477 --> 12:26.980
and everybody will think
that all I care about is myself.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.515
God, I hope
it's not a summer wedding.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.750
My linen suit is huge on me.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.855
Sorry to bug you,
but would it be inappropriate

12:34.888 --> 12:36.890
to ask to take a bath?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.335
Hmm, that a new exercise ball?

12:48.368 --> 12:51.338
Yeah. A 300-pound woman
popped one last night.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.340
I asked if her
baby was okay.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.507
Turns out she
wasn't pregnant.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.209
Or a woman.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.011
It wasn't a good night.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.279
So, what-what do you
think the weight limit is

12:59.312 --> 13:00.280
on one of these things?

13:00.313 --> 13:01.314
Oh, let's see.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.551
It, uh...

13:04.584 --> 13:07.187
It says 120 kilograms.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.857
There's 2.2 pounds
in every kilogram.

13:09.890 --> 13:10.924
Carry the decimal.

13:10.958 --> 13:15.362
I wouldn't put anyone
over 260 pounds on this ball.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.163
Unless it's Kevin James.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.331
I could watch
that guy do anything.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.067
Oh.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.368
I knew it, Dad.
I knew it.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.403
You're still smart.
You still know stuff.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.839
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.440
You tanked that test
on purpose, Dad.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.143
Why? I thought
you wanted to beat Adam.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.379
(sighs)
I did.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.347
Then I realized he
was really struggling

13:34.381 --> 13:37.584
when he asked if he
could phone a friend.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.819
Yeah, he called me.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.556
He asked me
to explain al-ga-bra.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.558
(laughs)

13:45.592 --> 13:47.360
And then I thought,

13:47.394 --> 13:49.529
if Adam has to sit
with Mikayla every night,

13:49.562 --> 13:51.364
he'll be forced
to learn everything

13:51.398 --> 13:53.500
they left out at the commune.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.335
Oh, I get it.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.471
Fractions are like a big pizza
with the slices taken out.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.375
Cool. Now I can be
pretty and smart.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.011
Me, too.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.512
(laughs)

14:06.947 --> 14:08.481
It's nice knowing
I got a really smart dad.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.418
Yeah, once Mikayla helps Adam
get through elementary school,

14:11.451 --> 14:14.054
she'll think her dad
is really smart, too.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.089
Ah.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.892
Oh, God, what a relief.

14:18.926 --> 14:19.993
You know, for a minute there,

14:20.027 --> 14:21.528
I was really starting to think
you were losing it.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.496
Even looked
into what kind

14:23.530 --> 14:24.998
of home we could send you to.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.537
FYI, we... we can't afford
a very good one.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.406
We were basically gonna have
to throw you down a well.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.610
*

14:41.448 --> 14:42.582
Naughty McGee's?
Please tell me

14:42.615 --> 14:44.484
we just have to
walk through here

14:44.517 --> 14:46.419
on the way to where your
girlfriend actually works.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.488
Look, I know
what you're thinking,

14:48.521 --> 14:50.023
but what we had was real.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.424
Uh-huh.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.593
For my birthday,
Amber gave me a free lap dance

14:53.626 --> 14:56.629
after I paid for four
regular-priced ones.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.099
Come on, let's get
a table up front.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.400
Maybe she'll sweat on us.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.535
Oh, good.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.071
Hey, Nate.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.405
Ray, what are you doing here?

15:05.438 --> 15:07.474
I'm here for Angela's
bachelor party with some guys

15:07.507 --> 15:10.410
from work and Susan...
who's a little too into it.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.945
Bounce, bitch. Bounce!

15:11.979 --> 15:13.413
(cheering and whistling)

15:13.446 --> 15:14.948
MAN:
Hey! Hey! Hey!

15:14.982 --> 15:16.649
Are you here
with Doug?
Yeah.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.418
Thanks to your
stop-and-chat, I sat down

15:18.451 --> 15:20.387
and got all wrapped up
in his personal drama.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.489
No, no, no, no,
you don't sit down, Nate.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.256
You screwed up
the stop-and-chat

15:23.290 --> 15:24.524
and turned it
into a sit-and-fix.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.494
(applause)
A sit-and-fix is just
for friends and family only.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.495
Not for coworkers, man.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.363
Nate, hurry up. She's coming on!

15:30.397 --> 15:31.564
If you miss the beginning,

15:31.598 --> 15:33.533
the rest of it's not gonna
make any sense!

15:33.566 --> 15:34.701
(applause and cheering)

15:34.734 --> 15:37.304
MAN:
Oh, look at that!

15:37.337 --> 15:39.139
Nathan, you're here
with Doug?

15:39.172 --> 15:40.573
(laughs)
Of course he is.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.442
He's a man of
the people.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.676
Hi, honey.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.578
Oh, Doug, no.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.280
Please don't cause
another scene.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.482
Look, I told you.
I'm not marrying you.

15:49.516 --> 15:52.385
Look, I think there's still
a chance for us.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.421
Look, Doug,
you're not getting it.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.722
Here's our relationship.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.757
I dance for you. That's it.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.459
You're right.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.229
I never realized
it was so one-sided.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.398
I can fix that.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.535
You let me
dance for you.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.003
Uh... Oh.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.038
(cheering)
MAN:
Doug!

16:11.071 --> 16:13.406
Oh...

16:13.440 --> 16:14.641
Is Doug allowed
to be put there?

16:14.674 --> 16:16.076
Can I go up
there, too?

16:16.109 --> 16:17.277
No. Susan...

16:17.310 --> 16:20.080
MAN (over P.A.):
Ernie, report to the stage
immediately.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.514
We've got a leaper.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.650
Doug, come on, buddy.
Come on down.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.252
Nobody wants
to see this.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.654
No. I am dancing until
Amber loves me back,

16:27.687 --> 16:29.622
or until I make $1,000.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.025
Thank you.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.327
MAN (over P.A.):
Make that two leapers.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.529
I'm sorry, miss.
Um, how about we just

16:36.563 --> 16:38.565
get his ring back,
and then we'll be gone?

16:38.598 --> 16:40.200
He didn't pay for my time

16:40.233 --> 16:42.202
in the champagne room
earlier-- two hours.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.205
Well, I wanted to get
through my whole poem.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.373
It's his grandmother's ring,

16:46.406 --> 16:47.574
okay, so just give
it back to us,

16:47.607 --> 16:48.575
and then we'll just...

16:48.608 --> 16:50.077
You're not getting this ring!

16:50.110 --> 16:52.245
Listen, come on.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.681
Nathan, you're ruining
my moment!

16:55.715 --> 16:57.550
She doesn't love you, Doug!

16:57.584 --> 16:59.286
I'm trying
to get your ring back

16:59.319 --> 17:01.554
so you can leave here
with a little dignity!

17:01.588 --> 17:02.622
(onlookers groaning)

17:04.457 --> 17:06.626
(panting)

17:07.660 --> 17:09.662
No. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

17:12.199 --> 17:14.134
I'm helping. I'm just helping!

17:14.167 --> 17:15.568
(groans)

17:22.309 --> 17:25.312
I've been going to strip
clubs since I was 11,

17:25.345 --> 17:27.180
and never once
did I end up in jail.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.648
Thanks for dragging me
into this, Nate.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.383
Hey, let's not play
the blame game.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.252
It's clearly
Doug's fault.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.721
Who falls in love
with a stripper?

17:34.754 --> 17:37.390
Richard Gere.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.759
That was a hooker,
and that was a movie.

17:39.792 --> 17:40.960
This is real life.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.796
There's a man doing his business
on the toilet right there.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.799
Hey, I have a name.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.702
I thought she loved me.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.804
I'm so stupid.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.240
How could I think

17:53.273 --> 17:55.242
that a beautiful woman
like Amber would fall

17:55.275 --> 17:57.244
for a walking marshmallow
like me?

17:57.277 --> 17:59.746
Might as well put me on a stick
and roast me,

17:59.779 --> 18:01.648
except I'd probably burn
and turn black,

18:01.681 --> 18:03.850
and you'd have to scrape me off
on a rock,

18:03.883 --> 18:05.885
and the poor rock would be
made fun of by the other rocks

18:05.918 --> 18:07.254
'cause he's covered in me!

18:07.287 --> 18:08.755
Oh, my God!

18:08.788 --> 18:11.424
Doug, you got to stop
beating yourself up, man.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.160
Ever since the day
we sat and talked,

18:13.193 --> 18:14.594
you've just been so down
on yourself.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.396
How does somebody
end up like this?

18:17.797 --> 18:21.334
Douglas Marie Dascal.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.703
I can't believe you!

18:23.736 --> 18:26.606
Giving your grandmother's
ring away to some fantasy girl

18:26.639 --> 18:28.608
and getting arrested.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.378
This is a new
low for you.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.514
And you punctured your rectum
on my best candle holder.

18:34.547 --> 18:38.851
I told you, you couldn't
jump over that couch!

18:38.885 --> 18:40.787
I think I know how he
ended up like this.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.423
I thought your father was
the king of all the losers,

18:43.456 --> 18:45.692
but you've just
taken his crown.

18:45.725 --> 18:50.263
I wish your twin brother had
been born instead of you!

18:50.297 --> 18:54.634
But you ate him like you
eat everything else!

18:54.667 --> 18:58.871
Hey, listen, what happened
tonight wasn't all Doug's fault.

18:58.905 --> 19:02.375
Hey, you're that newscaster.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.477
What, are you doing
a story about

19:04.511 --> 19:05.678
what a screw-up he is?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.780
Look what you've done now.
It's gonna be all over the news.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.782
Thank God your
grandmother

19:09.816 --> 19:13.753
never woke up
from her boob job to see this.

19:13.786 --> 19:17.190
No. No. I'm not
doing a story.

19:17.224 --> 19:20.393
This is just the result of
a wild night out with a friend.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.196
You're Doug's friend?

19:23.230 --> 19:25.298
Yeah, I'm his friend.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.835
Me Doug, this Doug,
Douglas Marie?

19:28.868 --> 19:30.970
Doug is a great guy.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.273
He's determined,
he's resourceful.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.908
Most of his teeth
aren't loose.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.211
And he's willing to tell
people how he feels

19:38.245 --> 19:40.980
no matter the fallout,
and that takes courage.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.515
I'm glad we're friends.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.884
(scoffs)
So,

19:44.917 --> 19:46.919
see you at lunch
on Monday?

19:46.953 --> 19:49.789
Yeah. I'll bring the sour
cream and onion chips,

19:49.822 --> 19:52.492
'cause we deserve 'em.

19:54.461 --> 19:57.397
Who would have thought?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.932
My son's friends
with a celebrity?

19:59.966 --> 20:00.933
Maybe the right kid

20:00.967 --> 20:04.737
did chew their way
out of the womb after all.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.542
CAROL:
Hurry! Hurry!

20:09.576 --> 20:10.843
Get him out of there!

20:10.877 --> 20:12.945
There's no VIP cell?

20:12.979 --> 20:14.881
You just put him in
with the riffraff?

20:14.914 --> 20:17.884
Oh, my God, get
them both out.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.453
Oh, my baby, are you hurt?

20:20.487 --> 20:21.788
Mom, I'm fine.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.256
I protected him.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.991
Nobody makes Nate a bitch
on my watch.

20:25.024 --> 20:28.261
I can't believe they
put both of you in

20:28.295 --> 20:31.431
with just a bunch of
filthy, lowlife criminals.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.433
I have a name.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.935
It's Darryl.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.938
Maybe now you're
ready to admit

20:38.971 --> 20:41.608
that you are better
than some people.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.676
No. You know what, Mom?

20:43.710 --> 20:45.378
I'm not better than anybody.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.980
But I do have a better mother.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.585
Just remember, anything you
say can and will be used

20:52.619 --> 20:54.053
in this year's holiday letter.

Oh, hey.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.964
You must be Nathan
Miller's mom.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.467
You know,
we should...
Hey, you.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.469
That's called
a hey-you-and-walk-on-through.
