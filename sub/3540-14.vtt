00:02.135 --> 00:03.830
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.003 --> 00:06.268
For over a century
I lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.439 --> 00:10.170
- I know the risk, but I have to know her.
Elena. Dead ringer for Katherine.

00:10.343 --> 00:14.336
- Our love for Katherine wasn't real.
- It was for me. I'm gonna bring her back.

00:14.514 --> 00:18.416
There's a tomb underneath the church.
A spell sealed Katherine in the tomb.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.246
- Tell me how to get in.
Grimoire.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.911
- Where is it?
- Check the journal. Jonathan Gilbert's.

00:23.089 --> 00:26.718
The Grimoire, it was Emily's, right?
That's what you need? I'll help you.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.561
You just couldn't live without me,
huh?

00:29.729 --> 00:30.957
Your eye.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.723
Where'd she go?
- Where'd who go?

00:32.899 --> 00:34.025
Anna.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.467
Elena.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

01:51.478 --> 01:52.775
I wouldn't.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.780
Don't try to escape. Don't even move.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.955
Do you understand?

02:05.658 --> 02:07.148
I understand.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.231
- Seriously?
- I told her not to move.

02:19.439 --> 02:20.667
I did that eye thing.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.536
But forgot the lesson about vervain.
She dates a vampire.

02:23.710 --> 02:27.168
- Who are you? What do you want?
Does it matter?

02:41.361 --> 02:43.192
Bonnie?

02:45.231 --> 02:46.255
Oh, my God.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.071
Anna took Elena.

03:01.247 --> 03:04.341
Yeah, I got that
from your 600 voicemails.

03:04.517 --> 03:08.112
Damon, all night long, every single street
in town, I've been searching.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.552
- What if your blood hasn't passed?
- At least you know you'll see her again.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.455
Please.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.185
What do you know?

03:16.362 --> 03:19.195
You were with Anna,
you know where she's living. Tell me.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.225
Nope.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.096
You can go.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.231
Really.

03:28.408 --> 03:31.536
You know,
all I can remember is hating you.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.736
Might have been different...

03:33.913 --> 03:36.541
...but your choices erased
anything good about you.

03:37.517 --> 03:41.783
But see, I also know that you have just
as much reason to hate me.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.750
This all began with me.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.888
Katherine got taken away from you...

03:49.062 --> 03:50.154
...because of me.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.325
And I'm sorry.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.729
Apology accepted.

04:01.074 --> 04:04.237
So please, just tell me
what you know.

04:06.079 --> 04:10.106
It's Elena, Damon.
If you know something, tell me.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.317
I mean this sincerely.

04:19.058 --> 04:23.154
I hope Elena dies.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.503
Bonnie?

04:32.672 --> 04:35.140
- Elena?
- Oh, you're okay.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.640
- My head.
- Here.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.607
- Oh, my God. Ben is a va...
- Shh.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.213
They can hear.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.886
I'm so stupid.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.680
No, he had all of us fooled.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.654
What's going on? Why are we here?

04:52.825 --> 04:55.988
It must have something to do
with the tomb and Emily's spell book.

04:56.162 --> 04:59.393
- Spell book?
- Damon said that it could open the tomb.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.295
Why didn't I know about any of this?

05:03.002 --> 05:06.233
I was trying to keep you out,
hoping it would never come to this.

05:06.406 --> 05:07.964
Come to what?

05:08.141 --> 05:10.541
They need a witch...

05:10.710 --> 05:13.144
...to break the spell
and let the vampires out.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.510
- No way.
- I know. I know. I know.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.415
You're wasting your time.

05:23.623 --> 05:24.715
I'm not gonna help you.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.159
That's why she's here.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.389
Motivation for you to behave.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.125
You know, you shouldn't be so desperate.
You made it too easy.

05:39.772 --> 05:41.205
She wants to talk to you.

05:43.509 --> 05:48.674
Well, well. Elena Gilbert.
You really are Katherine's doppelganger.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.413
You must have
the Salvatore boys reeling.

05:52.585 --> 05:53.779
Who are you?

05:54.587 --> 05:55.679
I'm Anna.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.948
Your brother may have mentioned me?

05:59.926 --> 06:02.417
I mean, we're, like, practically dating.

06:04.897 --> 06:07.593
Ten kegs? You know how much
damage we could do?

06:07.767 --> 06:10.031
- Duke's got it all hooked up.
- Duke's a douche.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.366
Yeah, a douche with 10 kegs.
A.k. a., my new best friend.

06:14.941 --> 06:18.035
- What's the problem, Gilbert?
- Don't have one, Lockwood.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.371
Yeah, I didn't think so.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.876
You ever get bored of it?

06:21.047 --> 06:23.072
- Of what?
- Yourself.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.420
- Heh, heh.
- Keep laughing, buddy.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.113
Hey, Jeremy.

06:30.289 --> 06:34.248
Where is Elena? I have been texting her
and Bonnie all day about Duke's party.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.054
Uh, she went somewhere with Stefan.

06:37.430 --> 06:41.298
I'm not gonna be one of those girls who
disappears because she has a boyfriend.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.729
Who is Duke?

06:42.902 --> 06:44.665
Guy that graduated
a couple years ago.

06:44.837 --> 06:48.068
And he throws a party
every time he comes home from Duke.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.141
Wait, Duke goes to Duke?

06:50.943 --> 06:52.604
His real name's Bob or something.

06:52.779 --> 06:56.806
He's a total ass, but he buys the beer.
You know, you should come.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.618
Uh, yeah, I don't think so.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.618
No, seriously. Everyone goes.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.252
Even quiet loner little brothers.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.316
Hmm.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.122
Think about it.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.426
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:14.600 --> 07:19.003
So I have a speech. It is fully scripted
and well rehearsed. Are you ready for it?

07:19.172 --> 07:20.434
You wrote a speech?

07:20.606 --> 07:25.009
Yes. It's a "You kissed me and I don't
want things to be weird" speech.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.874
- It's pre-emptive.
- Ha, ha. Pre-emptive?

07:28.047 --> 07:30.982
Yeah, you know, in case
you were having second thoughts...

07:31.150 --> 07:34.483
...or regrets, or were ooged out by it.
- "Ooged," huh?

07:34.654 --> 07:35.951
Heh.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.883
- Can I get on with the speech part?
- Yeah, go for it.

07:39.058 --> 07:42.824
So I know that you don't think that
this is going to work out between us.

07:42.995 --> 07:46.362
I just wanna let you know
that right here and right now...

07:46.532 --> 07:49.057
...I'm offering you an out.
Like an escape clause.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.202
Why are you giving me
an escape clause?

07:51.804 --> 07:55.570
I don't wanna make assumptions
about what it is we're doing here.

07:56.342 --> 07:58.207
Got it.

07:58.377 --> 08:03.280
So if you would like to exercise it...

08:03.583 --> 08:04.743
...just let me know.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.578
I'm good, but thanks.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.651
Okay.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.985
- Good.
- Yeah.

08:13.159 --> 08:16.390
- So see you for Duke's tonight?
- Yeah.

08:16.762 --> 08:17.786
Heh.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.697
- Yes?
- Hi there.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.394
I'm, uh, looking for Bonnie.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.004
She's not here.

08:27.707 --> 08:30.369
- Oh, do you know when she would be...?
- Never.

08:30.710 --> 08:35.010
Heh. Quite an opinion for someone
who doesn't know me.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.548
You got nerve knocking on a witch's door
and asking her for anything.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.344
What did I do?

08:40.520 --> 08:44.217
Spirits talk, Mr. Salvatore,
and so does my granddaughter.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.551
You are no friend to us.

08:46.726 --> 08:48.318
Now, get off my porch.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.425
Step outside and say that.

08:59.572 --> 09:03.372
I am not Bonnie.
You don't wanna mess with me.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.875
- Bonnie's not gonna open the tomb.
- Oh, I think she will.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.078
Do you really want Katherine
out that bad?

09:17.423 --> 09:21.086
Trust me. No one I know
wants to see that girl again.

09:21.260 --> 09:24.127
Except Damon, the love-struck idiot.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.423
Then what is it?

09:26.766 --> 09:28.290
Or who is it?

09:29.869 --> 09:31.097
My mother's in there.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.731
Katherine couldn't help herself.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.365
She just had to toy around
with both of the Salvatore brothers.

09:39.011 --> 09:42.572
Then when she got caught,
so did my mother.

09:44.283 --> 09:47.150
I watched Jonathan Gilbert
take her away.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.484
I'm sorry.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.980
You really mean that, don't you?

09:56.495 --> 10:00.329
Yeah, we'll skip the "dead mom" bonding
so you can start serving a purpose.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.100
- Which is what?
- Leverage.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.406
This belong to you? Uh-uh.

10:13.679 --> 10:14.805
Elena, are you okay?

10:14.981 --> 10:18.849
She's fine, for now. Tell me you have
the Grimoire, and she'll stay fine.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.786
- I can get it.
Which means your brother has it.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.447
And I have the witch.
So one of you...

10:26.626 --> 10:29.356
...had better meet me
in the town square in 30 minutes...

10:29.528 --> 10:33.828
...so we can safely discuss how fun
it's gonna be to work together.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.460
Go ahead. Grovel again.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.698
Oh, wait. No.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.473
I don't care.

10:48.247 --> 10:50.238
I'm leaving.

10:54.687 --> 10:55.915
Keep them buttoned down.

10:56.088 --> 10:58.181
Compulsion won't work.

10:58.357 --> 10:59.881
Just use violence.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.356
Right. I got that.

11:04.196 --> 11:06.255
Sit. Behave.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.095
So you're the key to this.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.599
Literally.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.068
The one who opens the door.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.003
Tell me, how long
have you been a witch?

11:16.575 --> 11:18.873
Is there anything to drink here?

11:19.045 --> 11:20.569
Are you offering?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.339
There's water on the nightstand.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.617
Hey. Can I have a sip?

11:43.769 --> 11:45.930
Come back in, shut the door.

11:46.872 --> 11:47.930
Don't hurt her.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.506
Don't make me.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.101
Lock it.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.059
Anna!

12:07.226 --> 12:10.525
Hey. What, uh...?
What happened to you last night?

12:10.696 --> 12:12.630
Sorry, I had to leave.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.198
- I told your sister.
- I haven't seen her.

12:16.602 --> 12:19.264
- I gotta run.
- Do you wanna go to a party tonight?

12:19.438 --> 12:21.929
- Do I what?
- The guy that's throwing it's a douche...

12:22.108 --> 12:23.735
...but it's supposed to be fun.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.377
I figured, you know,
safety in numbers.

12:26.545 --> 12:29.810
Heh, so you're finally ready
to go out with me, are you?

12:29.982 --> 12:33.213
A while since I've been to a party,
and I wanna get back out there.

12:33.385 --> 12:36.149
You know, not be such a loner.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.882
And, uh, I like you, you're fun.

12:40.059 --> 12:43.460
And you're also kind
of strange and lurky...

12:43.763 --> 12:45.424
...but, uh, I guess I like that too.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.992
So, yeah, you should come
to the party with me.

12:49.168 --> 12:52.433
It's in the woods
by that old cemetery.

12:53.806 --> 12:56.172
Oh. It's there, huh?

12:56.375 --> 12:57.603
That sounds cool.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.333
Uh, I'll meet you.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.878
Okay. Great.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.006
- Cool.
- Heh.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.119
Got a hot date or you just plan
on nabbing the entire Gilbert family?

13:18.297 --> 13:21.357
Party. Right next to the old cemetery.

13:21.534 --> 13:25.334
Isn't that nice of them?
Lots of warm bodies for starving vampires.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.631
I told you, I work alone.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.331
Yeah, so do I.

13:29.508 --> 13:32.341
But you're minus a witch
and I'm minus a spell book.

13:32.511 --> 13:33.876
So, what do you say?

13:34.046 --> 13:36.480
Stefan will come after you,
you know that.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.207
For messing with Elena.

13:38.417 --> 13:43.116
Then he won't be too happy if I kill her
when I don't get what I want.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.921
When do you wanna do this?

13:50.062 --> 13:52.929
God, it's like 1864 all over again.

13:53.566 --> 13:57.696
You Salvatores are truly pathetic
when it comes to women.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.304
Tonight. After sundown.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.530
Meet at the church.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.147
Witches don't have eternal life, right?

14:10.182 --> 14:12.173
So you guys can die.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.046
Yeah, we can die.

14:16.488 --> 14:20.015
Huh. That sucks.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.324
Stefan.

14:24.496 --> 14:26.464
Guys, get outside.

14:30.402 --> 14:33.428
When the sun goes down, leave town.

14:33.606 --> 14:37.337
If I ever see you again, I will kill you.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.846
How did you know where we were?

14:46.018 --> 14:48.953
Many things can fuel a witch's power.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.180
Worry, anger.

14:51.357 --> 14:55.054
After Stefan told me that
they had taken you, I had a lot of both.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.629
A simple locator spell
was easy after that.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.959
I'm sorry.

15:02.134 --> 15:03.795
About all of this.

15:04.003 --> 15:06.096
Not as sorry as they're gonna be.

15:08.107 --> 15:11.099
- So, what do we do now?
- Well, for now, you need to stay here.

15:11.277 --> 15:14.041
A prisoner in my own home?

15:14.213 --> 15:15.441
I don't think so.

15:15.614 --> 15:17.309
I can't protect you if you leave.

15:17.516 --> 15:18.778
We'll protect ourselves.

15:20.953 --> 15:23.444
We need to let him
have Katherine back.

15:23.622 --> 15:27.217
He's not gonna stop until he gets her.
If we help him, maybe that ends it.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.452
No. He doesn't deserve
to get what he wants.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.596
What other choice do we have?

15:33.666 --> 15:37.227
Witches being pulled down
by vampire problems.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.963
As much as we try to do
to stay out of it.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.606
I'll open the tomb.

15:45.144 --> 15:49.444
You get your brother's girl
and destroy the rest with fire.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.780
Then this will be all over.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.578
We have to get Damon to agree.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.846
- He already agreed once.
- Yeah, and we double-crossed him.

15:57.056 --> 16:00.116
- So now he's angry.
- He's hurt. There's a difference.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.622
I think I know what I have to do.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.666
You've got to be kidding me.

16:17.376 --> 16:18.434
It was Stefan.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.975
- There was nothing I could do.
- Just shut up. Stop talking.

16:27.019 --> 16:31.319
Without the witch,
we don't have Damon or the Grimoire.

16:32.624 --> 16:34.854
Damon's not gonna stop.

16:35.694 --> 16:37.821
He'll find a way to get in.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.226
And we're gonna be there
when he does.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.373
I'm gonna have to change the locks.

16:55.547 --> 16:57.310
You stage a jailbreak?

16:57.483 --> 16:59.178
- Stefan.
- Oh, brother.

17:00.652 --> 17:02.210
Ever the white knight.

17:03.555 --> 17:05.250
I convinced Bonnie to help you.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.085
I doubt that.

17:07.259 --> 17:11.025
I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry we got
the Grimoire without you last night...

17:11.696 --> 17:13.561
...because I'm not really.

17:13.732 --> 17:18.532
- Well, at least you're honest.
- I was protecting the people I love.

17:18.904 --> 17:21.531
But so were you,
in your own twisted way.

17:21.707 --> 17:26.269
And as hard as it is to figure, we're all
on the same side, after the same thing.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.106
- I'm not interested.
- Yes, you are.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.748
Because you were willing
to work with us yesterday.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.075
Fool me once, shame on you.

17:34.253 --> 17:37.848
Okay. When we were in Atlanta, why
didn't you use your compulsion on me?

17:40.893 --> 17:42.258
Who's to say I didn't?

17:43.929 --> 17:45.191
You didn't.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.461
I know you didn't.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.726
But you could have.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.570
You and I...

17:56.108 --> 17:57.700
...we have something.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.679
An understanding.

18:02.614 --> 18:05.549
And I know that my betrayal hurt you.

18:05.717 --> 18:08.151
Different from how it is
with you and Stefan.

18:08.320 --> 18:12.222
But I'm promising you this now,
I will help you get Katherine back.

18:15.694 --> 18:16.991
I wish I could believe you.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.095
Ask me if I'm lying now.

18:32.811 --> 18:36.474
You know Anna won't stop, by the way,
no matter what I do.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.516
Then we'll deal with it.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.930
I didn't compel you in Atlanta,
because we were having fun.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.931
I wanted it to be real.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.747
I'm trusting you.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.812
Don't make me regret it.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.361
The Duke party. I forgot.
I hope they stay clear of the church.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.973
- Your hope, not mine.
Elena, hey.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.905
Elena, oh, my God.
Where have you been?

19:40.245 --> 19:43.043
- Long story, no time to tell it.
- I wasn't talking to you.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.480
- Sure you were.
- We haven't met. I'm Matt.

19:46.652 --> 19:50.611
Matt, there's a reason we haven't met.
You and I are going that way.

19:50.789 --> 19:52.051
I'm sorry, guys.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.933
Cleared the debris away,
set the torches like you asked...

20:02.100 --> 20:04.398
...we can get down now.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.168
What is that?

20:07.372 --> 20:10.364
It's everything I need to destroy them.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.406
Are you sure Damon
will come back with her?

20:17.316 --> 20:18.943
Brother. Witches.

20:19.117 --> 20:21.585
Everything okay?
- I just wanna get this over with.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.152
Are we ready?

20:23.322 --> 20:25.153
I guess so.

20:25.757 --> 20:27.987
Come on. Now go, go, go.
Keep going.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.321
Go. Come on, man. Go, go, go.

20:30.495 --> 20:33.123
- Done.
That's my man.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.964
Hey, uh, I'll be right back.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.098
Hey, man.

20:40.272 --> 20:41.933
You got any weed?

20:42.107 --> 20:43.597
What? You're kidding me, right?

20:44.810 --> 20:47.278
You act like a dick
every time we cross paths...

20:47.446 --> 20:50.847
...and now you wanna party?
- Lighten up. I'm just asking a question.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.813
Look, I don't get you, man.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.043
It's a party.

20:54.219 --> 20:56.813
You're a partier.
There's no need to psychoanalyze it.

20:56.989 --> 21:00.356
I don't party anymore. And even if I did,
it wouldn't be with you.

21:01.059 --> 21:02.686
No problem.

21:02.861 --> 21:07.127
Carry on just standing there
by yourself, all alone.

21:07.299 --> 21:08.789
The enemy of fun.

21:10.535 --> 21:12.162
Do you even have any friends?

21:12.337 --> 21:14.635
TOKYO POLICE CLUB [SINGING
Filling an empty glass

21:14.806 --> 21:18.572
Stained my teeth with more red wine

21:18.744 --> 21:21.372
I'm a romantic

21:23.949 --> 21:25.007
Thank God.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.947
Weird hello, but okay.

21:28.253 --> 21:31.745
- What's the matter?
- Uh, nothing. I mean, just...

21:33.525 --> 21:34.549
It's nothing.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.724
- Come on. Let's walk.
- Heh.

21:41.733 --> 21:42.893
Air.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.060
Earth.

21:45.537 --> 21:47.198
Fire.

21:47.372 --> 21:48.669
Water.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.335
That's it? Just water from the tap?

21:52.511 --> 21:54.206
As opposed to what?

21:54.379 --> 21:58.110
I just figured maybe it would have to be
blessed or mystical or something.

22:02.387 --> 22:03.445
What's that?

22:03.622 --> 22:05.214
It's for Katherine.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.415
I gotta have something
to get her going.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.583
Unless your girl is offering up a vein.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.366
Admit it.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.900
You can't wait to get rid of me.

22:20.939 --> 22:24.033
- I can't wait to get rid of you.
- Mm.

22:25.944 --> 22:27.707
We're ready.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.710
This place is wild.

22:32.884 --> 22:34.215
You like dead people, huh?

22:34.386 --> 22:36.513
I'm strange, remember?

22:37.956 --> 22:39.617
You okay?

22:39.791 --> 22:41.952
Yeah, yeah. Uh...

22:42.127 --> 22:44.220
This place makes me think
about someone.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.727
A dead someone?

22:46.231 --> 22:48.222
No, no.

22:49.401 --> 22:50.834
Just someone I used to know.

22:52.604 --> 22:57.041
So, uh, hey, heh, we made it all of what,
37 minutes in that party?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.404
Heh. Not your scene?

22:59.578 --> 23:02.046
I'm not really sure
what my scene is anymore.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.613
Hmm.

23:05.283 --> 23:07.615
So, what do you say?
You wanna be a...?

23:07.786 --> 23:10.277
You wanna be part of my non-scene?

23:10.455 --> 23:14.084
I would happily be a part
of your non-scene.

23:14.259 --> 23:15.817
Except...

23:16.128 --> 23:17.618
...uh, I'm leaving.

23:18.563 --> 23:19.996
Wait, what?

23:20.165 --> 23:22.599
Yeah, my mom and I
are moving away.

23:22.968 --> 23:25.061
Oh, uh...

23:25.670 --> 23:28.264
That's... That's a bummer.

23:28.974 --> 23:31.568
- Yeah?
- Well, yeah.

23:32.377 --> 23:34.004
So...

23:34.179 --> 23:36.647
...I guess this is goodbye.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.983
I guess it is.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.219
Anna, your face.

23:52.397 --> 23:54.490
- It's nothing.
- It didn't look like nothing.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.104
You didn't have to hit him that hard.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.533
Yes, I did.

24:04.676 --> 24:08.635
Grab him and let's go.
I'm taking him to meet my mother.

24:17.923 --> 24:20.323
- Swoop.
- Hey.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.018
Where's your date?

24:23.228 --> 24:24.855
Who knows?

24:25.030 --> 24:27.828
- Aw, is the honeymoon over already?
- Maybe.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.365
After all that grief you gave me
about liking her.

24:30.535 --> 24:33.026
Figured it would have last longer
than five minutes.

24:33.238 --> 24:36.298
Look, I don't know if I can do
the whole public couple thing.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.739
She seems like
she might be a little clingy.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.673
Well, good.
I need my boy single anyway.

24:43.014 --> 24:45.107
Oh, incoming.

24:46.751 --> 24:48.946
- Hey, there you are.
- Here I am.

24:51.022 --> 24:54.480
Yeah, well, I'm not drunk enough,
so I'm just gonna go get another beer.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.862
- So?
- So?

25:00.031 --> 25:01.658
I have another speech.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.460
Okay.

25:04.469 --> 25:08.667
The hand thing with Elena,
it was lame.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.308
Well, I was lame.

25:11.476 --> 25:13.842
Hey, your feelings for Elena aside...

25:14.513 --> 25:18.005
...Damon was there and he was always
such a jerk to me...

25:19.885 --> 25:22.877
...and I wanted to show off
that I was with the good guy.

25:23.054 --> 25:25.682
So anyway, I was lame.

25:27.792 --> 25:31.057
So forgiven?

25:32.831 --> 25:35.664
Yeah. Of course, yeah.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.906
What are they saying?

25:52.083 --> 25:53.914
- Sounds Latin.
- Don't think it's Latin.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.199
What's happening?

26:16.641 --> 26:18.199
It worked.

26:19.544 --> 26:21.307
Well, of course it worked.

26:21.479 --> 26:25.973
- Don't you have some fires to build?
- I'm gonna get the gasoline. I'll be back.

26:31.856 --> 26:33.881
- You ready?
- What?

26:34.059 --> 26:37.051
Do you think I'm gonna go in by myself
so you can seal me?

26:37.228 --> 26:40.664
- I'll bring the walls down.
- You'll bring the walls down if I don't.

26:40.865 --> 26:43.299
- You think I trust you?
- As much as I trust you.

26:43.468 --> 26:44.833
Enough. Both of you.

26:45.003 --> 26:46.732
Look, he needs leverage.

26:46.905 --> 26:49.373
He needs to know
you're not gonna shut the door.

26:49.808 --> 26:51.173
I get it.

26:51.376 --> 26:52.604
I'll go.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.636
May I?

27:06.925 --> 27:08.017
Dark down there?

27:10.895 --> 27:12.658
I thought I told you to leave.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.799
I considered it.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.866
Then I thought, "Screw you. "

27:17.035 --> 27:18.434
Hey, hero.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.400
I'm going down there
to get my mother.

27:21.673 --> 27:23.334
I can't let you do that.

27:23.508 --> 27:26.409
Ben's about to make a main course
out of Elena's brother.

27:27.278 --> 27:31.271
So you can stop me or him.
Your choice.

27:44.629 --> 27:46.221
What is that?

27:46.965 --> 27:48.296
They can sense you.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.031
Now, where is she?

27:53.138 --> 27:54.833
Damon.

27:57.242 --> 27:58.903
Hey, you're not going in there.

27:59.077 --> 28:00.339
You think you can stop me?

28:00.979 --> 28:02.571
Bonnie.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.553
Why did you let her go in?

28:15.727 --> 28:18.662
Because she isn't coming out, baby.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.162
None of them are.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.028
Do you really think
that she cares about you?

28:25.570 --> 28:28.437
Hmm? You're disposable.

28:28.606 --> 28:30.938
I don't care.
She already gave me what I want.

28:31.109 --> 28:34.010
You gonna say, uh, "Eternal life?"

28:34.179 --> 28:35.476
You really that stupid?

28:36.715 --> 28:39.775
You know, I've heard about you.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.276
You don't feed.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.353
You're not strong enough to beat me.

28:49.494 --> 28:51.860
- Is that all you got?
- No.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.227
I got this.

29:08.813 --> 29:10.405
Damon?

29:11.249 --> 29:13.046
Damon.

30:04.235 --> 30:05.600
Where's Elena?

30:05.770 --> 30:07.237
Damon took her inside.

30:07.405 --> 30:08.736
- What?
Stefan...

30:08.907 --> 30:11.375
...if you go in there,
you won't come out.

30:12.744 --> 30:13.802
What did you do?

30:14.012 --> 30:18.278
Opening the door didn't remove the seal.
It just opened the door.

30:18.449 --> 30:20.144
What's the seal?

30:20.318 --> 30:23.253
Some seals
keep vampires from entering.

30:23.421 --> 30:27.152
This one keeps them from coming out.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.883
Elena's human.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.925
She can leave.

30:31.095 --> 30:32.426
Anna and Katherine can't.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.590
Damon can't.

30:35.767 --> 30:38.133
You were never planning
on breaking the spell.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.032
I told you.

30:41.739 --> 30:43.434
I will protect my own.

30:44.676 --> 30:45.938
Elena can get out.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.907
That's all that matters.

30:48.413 --> 30:51.246
You must have a taste for it.

30:51.416 --> 30:54.943
You scream and shriek
and even bother to escape...

30:55.119 --> 30:58.145
...but then you just come
right back to it.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.951
Mother. Mother.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.756
- Your boyfriend did this, you know.
- His father did.

31:06.931 --> 31:08.125
And Jonathan Gilbert.

31:08.299 --> 31:12.759
Made a choice that it would be Gilbert
blood that brought her back to life.

31:12.937 --> 31:16.771
I had Jeremy all ready to go, but...

31:22.814 --> 31:24.304
Stefan!

31:25.850 --> 31:27.818
You can't just leave him in there,
Grams.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.385
He made his choice.

31:30.121 --> 31:31.611
No.

31:32.190 --> 31:33.657
No. Here.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.816
Just show me what to do. I'll do it.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.791
We are not strong enough.

31:37.962 --> 31:42.797
Even if we bring the seal down, there's
no guarantee we could get it up again.

31:42.967 --> 31:46.528
You said it yourself, "Many things
can fuel a witch's power. "

31:47.472 --> 31:49.064
Help me.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.605
Or I'll do it alone.

32:02.553 --> 32:03.679
Please don't.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.186
Get strong.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.747
Let her go.

32:08.393 --> 32:09.883
No!

32:11.629 --> 32:14.223
- Go. Go. I'm right behind you.
- Please...

32:14.399 --> 32:15.889
Anna.

32:17.568 --> 32:19.035
Mama.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.568
- Annabel.
- Mother.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.014
Elena. Stefan...

32:31.182 --> 32:32.581
He's right behind me.

32:37.221 --> 32:39.519
Stefan, what are you doing?

32:39.691 --> 32:42.023
It's gonna be okay. We'll fix it.

32:42.193 --> 32:43.285
What is it?

32:43.461 --> 32:44.723
I can't.

32:44.896 --> 32:46.193
"Can't"? Can't what?

32:46.364 --> 32:49.731
The spell's still up.
We can't get them out yet.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.034
You went in not knowing
if you can come back out?

32:56.074 --> 32:57.701
Oh, my God.

32:58.576 --> 33:00.874
I heard you scream.

33:01.779 --> 33:04.543
We can't leave him in there.
We promised him, both of us.

33:05.049 --> 33:06.107
I know.

33:06.284 --> 33:11.244
Even if we're able to break the seal,
we won't be able to hold it for long.

33:16.894 --> 33:18.555
She's not here.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.994
Damon.
- She's not here.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.461
What?

33:23.801 --> 33:24.961
She's not here!

33:40.918 --> 33:42.010
I think it's working.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.148
I just wanted my mother back.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.460
Jeremy's fine. He's outside.
We won't touch him.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.026
Bonnie, keep going.

33:56.501 --> 33:57.525
They better hurry.

33:58.269 --> 34:00.635
Stefan, they can't hold it much longer!

34:07.378 --> 34:10.279
- Damon, we need to get out of here.
- They locked her inside.

34:10.447 --> 34:13.315
If we don't leave now,
we're not getting out.

34:13.484 --> 34:15.007
How could she not be in here?

34:15.186 --> 34:17.484
It's not worth
spending eternity down here.

34:17.655 --> 34:19.213
- She's not worth it.
- No!

34:19.389 --> 34:20.789
Damon.

34:24.128 --> 34:25.652
Please.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.072
Oh, my God. I can't.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.478
Yes, you can.

35:22.353 --> 35:23.786
Is this for real?

35:24.589 --> 35:26.113
Is what for real?

35:26.290 --> 35:30.624
You being all cool
and honest and open.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.799
Speech number three?

35:37.168 --> 35:38.499
I want this to work.

35:39.637 --> 35:43.471
And I'm scared that you're gonna change
your mind and you're not gonna want it.

35:44.075 --> 35:46.305
I don't wanna mess it up.

35:47.512 --> 35:49.878
I don't wanna mess it up either.

35:51.015 --> 35:55.247
BLACK REBEL MOTORCYCLE CLUB
Help yourself, don't think

35:55.419 --> 35:58.911
Help yourself, don't speak

36:03.961 --> 36:05.553
- He's okay.
Ugh.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.459
He's all right.

36:30.154 --> 36:32.714
I'm sorry.

36:47.705 --> 36:48.933
Hey, let me help you.

36:49.140 --> 36:52.576
Oh, I'm fine. You don't need
to coddle me, baby.

36:52.743 --> 36:56.179
It was a big spell, Grams.
I could tell it took a lot out of you.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.576
I'll be fine.

37:08.526 --> 37:09.720
How's your head?

37:09.894 --> 37:13.523
Uh, it's all right. I just...
I wish I knew how I passed out.

37:13.698 --> 37:15.757
I didn't drink that much. I swear.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.128
And you don't remember anything?

37:18.302 --> 37:20.167
The whole thing's cloudy. I just...

37:21.272 --> 37:23.536
I know how this looks. I'm sorry.

37:23.708 --> 37:26.871
No, Jeremy, don't be sorry.
You didn't do anything, okay?

37:27.044 --> 37:28.602
Yeah, okay.

37:28.779 --> 37:32.146
I've gotta head over to Bonnie's
for a little bit...

37:32.316 --> 37:34.250
...but is there anything that you need?

37:34.418 --> 37:36.784
No, I'm just...
I'm gonna crash and...

37:36.954 --> 37:39.218
Okay, well, Jenna's here
and I'll be back soon.

38:10.087 --> 38:13.147
- You knew Katherine wasn't there.
- You wouldn't have helped me.

38:14.258 --> 38:15.782
No! No!

38:15.960 --> 38:19.623
- Why do you get a happy ending?
- Please. You wouldn't have helped me.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.924
- Why do you get it and I don't?
- The guard.

38:22.099 --> 38:24.033
The one at the church
who locked us in.

38:24.769 --> 38:27.602
She promised to turn him.
He was obsessed with her.

38:28.606 --> 38:31.040
- No. Damon.
- She had him under her spell...

38:31.242 --> 38:32.800
- Please.
... like everybody else.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.775
He let her go.

38:40.618 --> 38:41.846
Last I saw her...

38:42.553 --> 38:44.316
...was Chicago...

38:44.789 --> 38:46.689
...1983.

38:46.857 --> 38:48.882
She knew where you were, Damon.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.392
She didn't care.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.568
Sorry.

39:13.718 --> 39:15.481
I just got to Bonnie's.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.712
- Everything all right?
Yeah.

39:17.888 --> 39:20.220
How's Damon? Is he gonna be okay?

39:21.792 --> 39:23.191
I don't know.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.022
Can I call you later?

39:25.196 --> 39:26.663
Yeah, of course.

39:55.426 --> 39:57.553
Here you go, Grams.

40:07.838 --> 40:08.862
Grams?

40:10.408 --> 40:11.932
Grams.

40:12.109 --> 40:13.474
Grams, wake up.

40:15.379 --> 40:16.778
Grams?

40:18.482 --> 40:19.506
Grams?

40:21.051 --> 40:23.451
Elena!

40:24.121 --> 40:25.315
Grams.

40:25.489 --> 40:27.855
Wake up. She's not breathing.

40:29.093 --> 40:32.221
Oh, she's not breathing.
Please. Wake up.

40:35.232 --> 40:38.463
Yes, I need an ambulance.
2 Oak Street.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.228
It's an emergency. Quick.

40:41.505 --> 40:44.269
- Bonnie. Bonnie.
- No, no. I can fix this.

40:44.442 --> 40:48.401
Bonnie. Bonnie. Bonnie.
- No. I can fix this. No!
