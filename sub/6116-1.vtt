01:03.879 --> 01:06.814
All of life is a coming home.

01:06.882 --> 01:11.148
Salesmen, secretaries, coal miners,
beekeepers, sword swallowers--

01:11.219 --> 01:13.153
all of us.

01:13.221 --> 01:16.486
All the restless hearts
of the world...

01:16.558 --> 01:19.493
all trying
to find a way home.

01:21.697 --> 01:25.098
lt's hard to describe
what l felt like then.

01:25.167 --> 01:28.603
Picture yourself walking
for days in a driving snow.

01:28.670 --> 01:31.605
You don't even know
you're walking in circles--

01:31.673 --> 01:34.608
the heaviness of your legs
in the drifts;

01:34.676 --> 01:37.042
your shouts
disappearing into the wind.

01:37.112 --> 01:39.342
How small you can feel.

01:39.414 --> 01:42.212
How far away home can be.

01:59.368 --> 02:01.393
Home.

02:01.470 --> 02:04.906
The dictionary defines it
as both a place of origin...

02:04.973 --> 02:07.032
and a goal or destination.

02:08.477 --> 02:10.411
And the storm?

02:10.479 --> 02:13.243
The storm was all in my mind.

02:13.315 --> 02:15.579
Or, as the poet Dante put it...

02:15.651 --> 02:19.348
''ln the middle of the journey of my life
l found myself in a dark wood...

02:19.421 --> 02:21.855
for l had lost
the right path.''

02:22.991 --> 02:25.789
Eventually l would find
the right path...

02:25.861 --> 02:28.694
but in the most unlikely place.

03:00.529 --> 03:02.463
How many fingers
do you see?

03:02.531 --> 03:04.965
You crazy--
Stop sneakin' up on me like that.

03:05.033 --> 03:06.762
How many?

03:06.835 --> 03:09.463
- Four.
- Four?

03:09.538 --> 03:11.972
Four?

03:12.040 --> 03:13.974
Another idiot.

03:15.143 --> 03:17.202
You gon' love it here.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.714
Got a new one, Jane.
Hunter Adams.

03:20.782 --> 03:23.717
Self-committed. Suicidal.
Slate him with Dr. Prack.

03:23.785 --> 03:25.719
All right.

03:33.161 --> 03:36.289
Hey, Rudy!
What's the word, my man?

03:36.364 --> 03:39.925
He ain't left that bed in three weeks.
He won't give you any trouble.

03:40.001 --> 03:43.232
He needs another bedpan. They're in
the closet. Wake-up is 7:00 a.m.

03:43.305 --> 03:45.239
Excuse me.

03:45.307 --> 03:48.299
ls there any way
l could have my own room?

03:49.711 --> 03:51.838
Oh, absolutely.

03:51.913 --> 03:54.643
Just call the concierge and ask
for a suite overlooking the fountain.

03:54.716 --> 03:57.150
No, l-l prefer
the cabana room.

03:57.219 --> 03:59.278
Get some sleep.

04:10.332 --> 04:12.266
Hi.

04:14.136 --> 04:16.195
Hi.

04:19.908 --> 04:21.841
You're, um...

04:23.044 --> 04:26.707
you're a lot... fuzzier
than my last roommate.

04:26.782 --> 04:28.374
Oh. Yeah.

04:28.450 --> 04:30.384
Keeps me warm.

04:31.453 --> 04:34.013
Aaaah!

04:36.191 --> 04:38.819
- What's wrong?
- Get 'em away!

04:38.894 --> 04:41.727
- Get what away?
- Get 'em-- Get 'em away!

04:41.797 --> 04:44.288
- Okay, l'm gonna have to--
- You traitor!

04:44.366 --> 04:48.496
You brought 'em with you
when you opened the door!

04:48.570 --> 04:51.368
Who?

04:53.375 --> 04:56.310
We need help in here!

04:56.378 --> 04:58.312
Somebody!

05:00.882 --> 05:02.816
- All right.
- No! No! No!

05:02.884 --> 05:06.911
They'll get me! Don't take me down!
They'll get me! No!

05:06.988 --> 05:09.923
Don't let the squirrels get me!
Please!

05:09.991 --> 05:11.720
Don't let the squirrels get me!

05:14.796 --> 05:17.731
That was a squirrel bite!

05:17.799 --> 05:19.892
Squirrels.

05:22.237 --> 05:25.172
My father died when l was nine.

05:25.240 --> 05:29.336
He was in the army.
He wasn't home very much.

05:30.478 --> 05:33.413
Two weeks before he died...

05:33.481 --> 05:36.416
he told me that
in the Korean War...

05:36.484 --> 05:38.918
it felt like
he'd lost his soul.

05:38.987 --> 05:42.582
All this time
l thought it was me.

05:42.657 --> 05:46.593
l moved seven times
in the last year.

05:46.661 --> 05:49.255
l've, uh, had several jobs.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.100
Nothing seemed to fit.

05:53.168 --> 05:55.102
l don't seem to fit.

05:57.672 --> 06:01.039
And when your father died,
how did that make you feel?

06:01.109 --> 06:03.873
l don't know.
l was nine.

06:05.447 --> 06:08.780
lt was like there was
this distinction, suddenly...

06:08.850 --> 06:11.785
between you
and the rest of the world.

06:11.853 --> 06:13.787
l looked around me.

06:13.855 --> 06:17.416
Life went on
just like it did before.

06:17.492 --> 06:20.757
But it wasn't
like it was before.

06:20.829 --> 06:23.764
My uncle helped.
He would visit.

06:23.832 --> 06:25.766
He at least listened.

06:27.469 --> 06:29.460
And l thought...

06:29.537 --> 06:34.497
if l could light my own farts l could
fly to the moon, or at least Uranus.

06:34.576 --> 06:38.103
But if l couldn't do that at least
l could use my penis as a pogo stick...

06:38.179 --> 06:41.114
and that might be a way
of getting around.

06:41.182 --> 06:43.480
l'm sorry?

06:43.551 --> 06:45.485
Yes, that's good.
Mm-hmm.

06:47.289 --> 06:50.781
Well, l think you're making
fine progress, Hunter.
We'll talk later in group.

06:51.860 --> 06:53.794
Thank you.

07:02.570 --> 07:07.007
Four. Four? Four!

07:07.075 --> 07:10.374
Ohh! Four! Ohh!

07:10.445 --> 07:14.506
You are all insane!
lnsane! Four!

07:14.582 --> 07:16.675
Arthur Mendelson.

07:18.086 --> 07:20.020
The Arthur Mendelson?

07:20.088 --> 07:22.215
Brand Beaton lndustries.

07:22.290 --> 07:25.225
Guy was one of the most
innovative minds of our time.

07:25.293 --> 07:28.228
Look at him now.
He can't even count the windows.

07:30.365 --> 07:33.300
God. What happened to him?
Why is he here?

07:33.368 --> 07:37.065
Self-committed. Genius syndrome.
Howard Hughes-type shit.

07:37.138 --> 07:40.665
Constantly digging into the
creative potential of the human mind.

07:43.244 --> 07:45.508
l guess he dug too deep.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.548
This is real wood.

07:47.615 --> 07:50.175
Rowff!

07:53.421 --> 07:57.016
W-Why are we meeting in here?
lt's cramped.

07:57.092 --> 08:00.528
Well, Everton, we're meeting in here
so that Rudy can participate.

08:00.595 --> 08:03.564
- lt's cramped.
- Does anyone else
have a thought on that?

08:03.631 --> 08:06.998
- Cramped!
- l think he has a question.

08:09.070 --> 08:12.506
Do you find that funny, Hunter,
making fun of a man's infirmity?

08:12.574 --> 08:15.168
Maybe he does have a question.
He's alive.

08:15.243 --> 08:18.178
- He's catatonic.
- Well, he still has a brain.

08:18.246 --> 08:21.010
- Maybe he wants to participate too.
- Yeah.

08:21.082 --> 08:23.016
Maybe he has a question.

08:23.084 --> 08:25.018
Yeah, maybe.

08:25.086 --> 08:27.281
Maybe he knows why we're cramped!

08:30.358 --> 08:33.953
Maybe Beany knows a lot more
than we give him credit for.

08:34.029 --> 08:36.929
Excuse me. Beany?
Which way is heaven?

08:36.998 --> 08:38.932
That's correct!

08:39.000 --> 08:40.467
That'll be enough, Hunter.

08:40.534 --> 08:43.595
Beany, how much taller
is Wilt Chamberlain than you?

08:43.671 --> 08:45.798
- Right.

08:45.874 --> 08:49.037
Hey, Beany! Beany!
Where's the ceiling?

08:49.110 --> 08:51.408
That's enough. Stop it.

08:51.479 --> 08:54.039
Where do the birds fly, Beany?

08:54.115 --> 08:56.049
How do you say hello to Hitler?

08:56.117 --> 08:59.917
Beany, how does Hitler say hello?

09:01.356 --> 09:05.725
How do you check
an elephant for a hernia?

09:05.794 --> 09:09.127
Who would win a staring contest?
Beany!

09:09.197 --> 09:11.165
Who-- Who farted?

09:11.232 --> 09:13.325
Beany!

09:13.401 --> 09:16.268
- Who likes to masturbate?
- Yea!

09:16.337 --> 09:18.305
l do! l do!

09:18.373 --> 09:22.309
Hey, Beany, how does an
one-armed referee say ''field goal''?

09:22.377 --> 09:24.004
Ha ha! Hey, Beany!

09:24.079 --> 09:27.446
Ciao, Beany!
Arigato, Beany!

09:27.515 --> 09:29.449
Bye, Beany.

09:31.986 --> 09:34.045
lt was a really good session,
l thought.

09:50.126 --> 09:52.060
May l come in?

09:53.363 --> 09:55.797
lf you bend your medial
collateral ligaments...

09:55.865 --> 09:58.299
and place one talus
in front of another...

09:58.368 --> 10:00.802
l don't see where
you'd have a problem.

10:00.870 --> 10:03.805
Of course, if there were a news story
covering this event...

10:03.873 --> 10:06.899
the headline might read:
''Small Brain Enters Room.''

10:09.412 --> 10:12.245
The fingers.
What's the answer?

10:12.315 --> 10:15.250
Oh, you're another one of
those bright young fellows...

10:15.318 --> 10:18.253
who always know the right answer,
is that it?

10:18.321 --> 10:20.482
Welcome to real life.

10:55.992 --> 10:57.926
How many do you see?

11:00.463 --> 11:03.398
- There are four fingers, Arthur.
- No, no, no. Look at me.

11:03.466 --> 11:05.229
What?

11:05.301 --> 11:07.235
Y-You're focusing
on the problem.

11:07.303 --> 11:10.397
lf you focus on the problem,
you can't see the solution.

11:10.473 --> 11:13.670
Never focus on the problem.
Look at me!

11:14.977 --> 11:17.571
How many do you see?

11:19.248 --> 11:22.843
No, look beyond the fingers.

11:22.919 --> 11:24.853
How many do you see?

11:30.426 --> 11:32.360
Eight.

11:32.428 --> 11:35.420
Eight. Eight.
Yes! Yes!

11:35.498 --> 11:38.467
Eight's a good answer.
Yes.

11:38.534 --> 11:40.934
See what no one else sees.

11:41.003 --> 11:43.733
See what everyone else
chooses not to see...

11:43.806 --> 11:46.866
out of fear
and conformity and laziness.

11:46.943 --> 11:50.242
See the whole world anew
each day.

11:51.747 --> 11:54.682
Ah, the truth is,
you're well on the way.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.685
lf you didn't
see something here...

11:57.753 --> 12:01.018
besides a crazy,
bitter old man...

12:01.090 --> 12:04.025
you wouldn't have come
in the first place.

12:07.530 --> 12:10.465
What do you see
when you look at me, Arthur?

12:14.704 --> 12:16.638
You fixed my cup.

12:18.207 --> 12:20.141
l'll see you around...

12:21.444 --> 12:23.378
Patch.

12:31.153 --> 12:33.587
Rudy, stop.

12:33.656 --> 12:36.090
You're throwing off
my rhythm.

12:36.158 --> 12:38.092
You'll go blind.

12:39.262 --> 12:41.924
- Please.
- l have to go to the bathroom.

12:41.998 --> 12:45.934
Then go. lt's right over there,
15 feet away.

12:46.002 --> 12:49.961
- l would, but--
- But what? The squirrels?

12:50.039 --> 12:52.473
- How many?
- There's only one just now.

12:53.809 --> 12:56.903
You can't go to the bathroom
because of one squirrel?

12:56.979 --> 12:59.812
lf l get off the bed,
he'll get the others.

13:01.050 --> 13:02.984
That's not the point.

13:03.052 --> 13:04.986
They're squirrels.

13:05.054 --> 13:07.079
Squirrels, Rudy.

13:07.156 --> 13:11.092
- They're one of the most amiable
creatures on the planet.
- Oh, no, they're not.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.095
On the list of hostile predators,
they're right above the bottom...

13:14.163 --> 13:16.757
just above baby chicks
and slugs.

13:16.832 --> 13:19.323
What could they possibly want?
Your nuts?

13:20.403 --> 13:22.837
- Do you think?
- Oh, Rudy.

13:22.905 --> 13:25.999
- Come on, l'll take you.
- Don't move.

13:26.075 --> 13:29.340
- Don't move.
- Another one?

13:30.813 --> 13:34.146
lt's on the end of your bed,
on the rail.

13:38.220 --> 13:41.189
Be careful.
lt's gonna jump.

13:53.235 --> 13:55.795
- There's one, at the end of the bed!
- Bang!

13:55.871 --> 13:58.806
There's one runnin'
across the sprinkler!

13:58.874 --> 14:01.206
- Boom!
- ln back of the door!
Back of the door!

14:01.277 --> 14:04.212
Coming out of the bathroom!

14:04.280 --> 14:06.714
Bathroom! Bathroom!
Bathroom! Bathroom!

14:06.782 --> 14:09.182
Yea!

14:09.251 --> 14:12.982
Eat lead, fur bag!
Blam! Ha-ha!

14:13.055 --> 14:16.491
- You're cured-- Aaah!
- You've got one on your shoulder!

14:16.559 --> 14:19.187
Get it off me! Get it off me!

14:19.261 --> 14:22.594
Get it off me! Aaaah!

14:24.233 --> 14:27.168
We need more cover!
They're comin' in the back door!

14:27.236 --> 14:30.763
- Get under cover, Rudy!
- Build a fort! Build a fort!
We can build a fort!

14:30.840 --> 14:35.106
- We need a fort!
- Aaah! Down! Get down!

14:38.881 --> 14:40.815
They're gone.

14:40.883 --> 14:43.818
l think it's safe to go
to the bathroom, Rudy. Come on.

14:43.886 --> 14:46.480
- No, it's too risky.
- No.

14:46.555 --> 14:48.489
Not when you have...

14:49.558 --> 14:51.492
this.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.495
- A bazooka.
- Yeah.

14:54.563 --> 14:56.497
Load.

15:01.070 --> 15:04.301
- Let's do it!
- Aaaah!

15:21.757 --> 15:23.691
Yes.

15:31.801 --> 15:33.735
l'd like to leave.

15:35.304 --> 15:38.467
Hunter, we'll have to discuss this
at your scheduled time.

15:38.541 --> 15:40.475
l'm leaving.

15:41.577 --> 15:43.511
Have you thought
about what you'll do?

15:43.579 --> 15:46.013
l want to help people.

15:46.082 --> 15:49.574
Last night with Rudy,
l connected to another human being.

15:49.652 --> 15:53.918
l want more of that.
l want to learn about people,
help them with their troubles.

15:53.989 --> 15:56.321
- That's what l do.
- But you suck at it.

15:56.392 --> 15:59.327
You don't even look at people
when they're talking.

15:59.395 --> 16:01.989
l want to listen,
really listen to people.

16:02.064 --> 16:06.592
l can't allow you to leave. l believe
you still have some issues to work out.

16:06.669 --> 16:10.105
Ah. Well, l don't need your permission
because l admitted myself.

16:10.172 --> 16:12.106
- Hunter.
- Mm-hmm?

16:12.174 --> 16:15.610
l must warn you
my report will read ''A.M.A.''--

16:15.678 --> 16:18.841
that you were signed out of this
hospital ''against medical advice.''

16:18.914 --> 16:22.008
And my report will read
''l.D.G.A.R.A.''

16:22.084 --> 16:24.518
''l don't give a rat's ass.''

16:25.921 --> 16:27.855
And my name is Patch.

17:03.305 --> 17:05.739
Hello.
How you doin'?

17:05.808 --> 17:07.742
How do you do?

17:10.045 --> 17:12.479
Hey, this is a nice room.

17:12.548 --> 17:16.143
- May l help you?
- Yeah, l could really use
a foot massage right now.

17:17.553 --> 17:19.487
Rephrasing:
What are you doing here?

17:19.555 --> 17:21.989
l'm your new roommate.
l-l'm moving in.

17:24.260 --> 17:28.629
l don't mean to be rude,
but aren't you a little old
to be starting medical school?

17:28.697 --> 17:31.723
You know, Babe Ruth was 39
when he joined the Yankees.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.735
- No, he wasn't.
- You're right.

17:33.803 --> 17:37.899
But l could really use
an example like that, and if
you ever find one, let me know.

17:39.742 --> 17:42.040
Hi. Patch Adams.

17:42.111 --> 17:44.545
Mitch Vroman.
Georgetown University.

17:44.613 --> 17:47.639
l was awarded the William F. Thompson
Scientific Achievement Award.

17:47.716 --> 17:49.650
Mmm. Emerson Elementary.

17:49.718 --> 17:53.552
l once drew a picture of a rabbit
that got me two gold stars.

17:55.724 --> 17:59.057
l'm gonna go
back over there now.

18:03.132 --> 18:06.397
First do no harm.

18:06.468 --> 18:10.802
What is implicit in this
simple precept of medicine?

18:11.941 --> 18:14.068
An awesome power.

18:14.143 --> 18:16.577
The power to do harm.

18:18.047 --> 18:20.379
Who gives you this power?

18:20.449 --> 18:22.542
The patient.

18:22.618 --> 18:25.917
A patient will come to you
at his moment of greatest dread..

18:25.988 --> 18:29.822
hand you a knife and say,
''Doctor, cut me open.''

18:29.892 --> 18:31.860
Why?

18:31.927 --> 18:34.088
Because he trusts you.

18:34.163 --> 18:37.530
He trusts you
the way a child trusts.

18:37.600 --> 18:42.560
He trusts you
to do no harm.

18:42.638 --> 18:45.266
The sad fact is...

18:45.341 --> 18:47.809
human beings
are not worthy of trust.

18:48.911 --> 18:50.845
lt is human nature to lie...

18:50.913 --> 18:54.178
take shortcuts,
to lose your nerve, get tired...

18:54.250 --> 18:56.650
make mistakes.

18:56.719 --> 19:00.314
No rational patient would
put his trust in a human being...

19:00.389 --> 19:02.823
and were not gonna let him!

19:02.892 --> 19:05.019
lt is our mission here...

19:05.094 --> 19:09.121
to rigorously and ruthlessly
train the humanity out of you...

19:09.198 --> 19:11.530
and make you
into something better.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.837
We're gonna make doctors
out of you.

19:32.521 --> 19:34.455
Two years of studying.

19:34.523 --> 19:37.458
l thought we'd have more contact
with patients. Didn't you?

19:37.526 --> 19:39.460
Hi. l'm Patch.

19:39.528 --> 19:41.962
You've just experienced
a North American greeting...

19:42.031 --> 19:44.465
whereby one person offers
a verbal label to another...

19:44.533 --> 19:46.967
as an expression
of welcome and friendship.

19:47.036 --> 19:49.163
Lesbian. Ball-buster.
Airhead. Leech.

19:49.238 --> 19:52.173
Whichever one of these disgusts
you the most, take your pick.

19:52.241 --> 19:54.175
- Well--
- Please pass the word.

19:54.243 --> 19:57.679
l am not here to date. l am not
here to flirt. l'm here to study.

19:59.748 --> 20:01.682
Thank you.

20:01.750 --> 20:05.186
l thought only l could repel women
with that kind of raw efficiency.

20:05.254 --> 20:08.018
Well, you just met your match.

20:08.090 --> 20:10.354
- Patch Adams.
- Truman Schiff.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.860
Nice to meet you, Truman.

20:12.928 --> 20:15.021
Will you go out with me?

20:18.867 --> 20:21.495
May l ask you one question?

20:21.570 --> 20:25.062
- Do you buy everything
the dean was saying today?
- What do you mean?

20:25.140 --> 20:27.574
l mean, that whole
drill sergeant thing.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.874
''We're gon' make doctors
out of you medical scum.

20:30.946 --> 20:33.380
- Now drop down and give me 20.''
- Mm-hmm.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.007
That whole marine thing.

20:35.084 --> 20:38.019
We're not even gonna see
a patient until the third year.

20:38.087 --> 20:40.021
Up until then,
it's just memorizing facts.

20:40.089 --> 20:42.023
-Why don't they just shove the book up--
-Hamburger?

20:42.091 --> 20:46.118
Right here on the colon. That's where
it's going anyway. Thanks very much.

20:46.195 --> 20:48.891
- So, why do you wanna be a doctor?
- l want to help.

20:48.964 --> 20:53.025
l want to connect with people.
A doctor interacts with people
at their most vulnerable.

20:53.102 --> 20:56.367
He offers treatment,
but he also offers counsel and hope.

20:56.438 --> 20:59.373
That's why l love the idea
of being a doctor.

20:59.441 --> 21:02.706
l've always been fascinated by
the development of the human mind.

21:02.778 --> 21:04.939
Ah. Pumping neurons.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.448
We start out so open
and spontaneous.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.952
We're real individuals. Then somewhere
along the way we're drawn to conform.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.615
- lt's as if we're conditioned
by programmed responses.
- Well, that's true.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.625
But sometimes you can alter
the programmed response...

21:17.693 --> 21:21.823
just by changing some of the conditions,
altering the parameters.

21:21.897 --> 21:23.797
Let me show you.

21:24.967 --> 21:26.901
We'll call it
the ''hello'' experiment.

21:26.969 --> 21:29.403
The goal will be to break through
programmed response...

21:29.471 --> 21:31.405
by changing normal parameters...

21:31.473 --> 21:33.270
and getting a new emotional response
from the person.

21:33.342 --> 21:35.276
Ready to enter data.

21:37.079 --> 21:39.013
Hello.

21:39.081 --> 21:41.345
Hi.

21:45.287 --> 21:47.221
Wait.
l don't get it.

21:47.289 --> 21:49.416
''Hi'' is a programmed response.

21:49.491 --> 21:52.051
- l reached her.
- You scared her.

21:52.127 --> 21:55.290
No. Wait.
Wait for it.

21:56.498 --> 21:58.932
Oh, you're nuts.

21:59.001 --> 22:01.526
A smile.

22:01.603 --> 22:04.197
Ten seconds.
Victory.

22:04.273 --> 22:06.537
There's more.
Come, my friend.

22:08.143 --> 22:10.077
- Howdy!
- Hi.

22:10.145 --> 22:12.079
See?
Response time is diminishing.

22:12.147 --> 22:14.581
Yesterday l made
12 random phone calls.

22:14.650 --> 22:18.086
l talked to one man named Dale for
three hours. He told me amazing things.

22:18.153 --> 22:21.088
But what does this all prove,
other than you're out of your mind?

22:21.156 --> 22:24.091
What's the difference between
a doctor and a scientist?

22:24.159 --> 22:26.093
And don't say salary.

22:26.161 --> 22:29.597
People. Hmm? We want to become doctors
because we want to help people.

22:29.665 --> 22:31.599
l want to be
a pediatrician.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.601
Okay, little people.

22:33.669 --> 22:37.105
The point is, we have to treat
the patient as well as the disease.

22:37.172 --> 22:42.269
That's why we have to dive into people,
wade into the sea of humanity, Truman.

22:42.344 --> 22:44.904
Ballroom seven,
right upstairs on your left.

22:44.980 --> 22:48.916
- You guys with
the meat packers convention?
- Yes, sir!

22:48.984 --> 22:50.918
Right up the stairs.
Ballroom seven.

22:50.986 --> 22:53.921
- Hey! Does a chicken have lips?
- You'll find out upstairs!

22:53.989 --> 22:56.514
Like a bulldog
on a pork chop!

23:08.103 --> 23:11.038
You know, in New Zealand
they found a whole new use for sheep.

23:11.106 --> 23:13.040
- What's that?
- Wool!

23:14.309 --> 23:17.244
You're funny!
You kill me! You kill me!

23:17.312 --> 23:19.246
- l love you!
- Oh, daddy!

23:19.314 --> 23:22.249
And you-- l bet you've heard that too!
Come here! Ha ha!

23:22.317 --> 23:24.979
- ''Herd'' it? That's a goat joke!
- Ohh!

23:34.496 --> 23:36.430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:39.201 --> 23:41.396
On your meat!

23:41.470 --> 23:43.904
Get set! Go!

23:45.874 --> 23:49.071
Ohh! Yeah!

23:50.145 --> 23:52.443
l won!

23:55.450 --> 23:59.113
Pork packers,
rump wrappers, bull shippers,

23:59.188 --> 24:02.055
lend me your steers!

24:05.360 --> 24:10.457
You know, we packers have been
taking a bad rap for years.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.966
Yeah!

24:13.035 --> 24:17.165
Because we all want to be
the best damn packers there are!

24:17.239 --> 24:20.265
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- l'm proud of my meat!

24:20.342 --> 24:22.833
- And l know you're proud of your meat!
- Yeah!

24:22.911 --> 24:25.812
- Whip it, zip it and send it out!
- Yeah!

24:27.883 --> 24:29.976
You know,
some people say chicken.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.246
- No!
- No!

24:31.320 --> 24:33.618
- Some people say fish.
- No!

24:33.689 --> 24:38.285
l say,
now is the time for cow!

24:40.362 --> 24:43.195
Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow!

24:43.265 --> 24:47.497
Eat cow! Eat cow!
Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow!

24:47.569 --> 24:51.300
Eat cow! Eat cow!
Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow!

24:51.373 --> 24:53.341
Hey, bud.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.603
- Hey!
- Oh!

24:55.677 --> 24:58.771
Yes, thanks.
Oh, yeah.

24:58.847 --> 25:02.283
Hey-- Whoa!

25:02.351 --> 25:04.285
What is it?

25:04.353 --> 25:08.541
What's the difference
between a first-year
and a third-year medical student?

25:13.513 --> 25:17.950
Doctor Vukov, please dial line 1242.

25:18.017 --> 25:21.783
Dr. Vukov,
please dial line 1242.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.457
Here we have
a juvenile onset diabetic...

25:26.526 --> 25:29.689
with poor circulation
and diabetic neuropathy.

25:29.763 --> 25:32.698
As you can see,
these are diabetic ulcers...

25:32.766 --> 25:34.961
with lymphedema
and evidence of gangrene.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.968
Questions?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.664
- Any osteomyelitis?
- None apparent.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.297
Although not definitive.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.501
- Treatment?
- To stabilize the blood sugar.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.306
Consider antibiotics,
possibly amputation.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.472
What's her name?

25:52.719 --> 25:55.688
l was just wondering
the patient's name.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.624
Marjorie.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.621
Hi, Marjorie.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.322
Hi.

26:05.432 --> 26:07.957
Yes, um, thank you.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.968
Let's move on.

26:12.372 --> 26:15.307
- What are you doing?
- Continuing the experiment. Come on.

26:15.375 --> 26:18.310
We can start a lemonade stand
together after we get kicked out
of medical school.

26:18.378 --> 26:20.073
Bye, Marjorie.

26:20.146 --> 26:23.081
l cannot stand it in there, Joletta.

26:23.149 --> 26:26.084
He doesn't have
to talk to me like that.

26:26.152 --> 26:29.588
l know, hon, but really,
how good a mood would you be in?

26:30.723 --> 26:34.022
- May l help you?
- Oh, um--

26:34.093 --> 26:37.028
So l'll meet you
at the club.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.691
Oh, great.
Maybe we'll play the back nine, hmm?

26:42.168 --> 26:45.103
Hello. l'm Patch.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.105
l'm studying medicine here.

26:47.173 --> 26:51.234
Well, not here, but--
Y-You know.

26:51.311 --> 26:54.109
Lookit here, Judy.
Another future boss.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.239
Oh, l wouldn't
look at it like that.

26:56.316 --> 26:58.250
You may think
l'm exaggeratin'...

26:58.318 --> 27:01.185
but in another five years
you'll be so full of yourself...

27:01.254 --> 27:04.849
you'll have to hang a cup out your ass
just to catch the excess.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.392
- Joletta!
- Ouch.
- Well, hell, why not?

27:07.460 --> 27:10.395
lt's the only time in my life
l'm gonna outrank him.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.931
Might as well enjoy it.

27:12.999 --> 27:16.992
- Who's in that room?
- Don't even think about it.
He'll bite your head off.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.265
Mr. Davis.
Pancreatic cancer.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.374
How long does he have?

27:22.442 --> 27:25.377
Longer than you,
if you go in that room.

27:25.445 --> 27:27.538
So be sure
you steer clear.

27:27.614 --> 27:30.208
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.385
Hey!
What year are you?

27:40.693 --> 27:42.627
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:51.371 --> 27:54.238
Dr. Landaker to Administration.

27:54.307 --> 27:56.741
Dr. Landaker
to Administration, please.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.006
Hi.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.939
Hi.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.705
- What's your name?
- Cameron.

28:32.779 --> 28:36.044
Hi, Cameron.
l'm Patch.

28:57.203 --> 29:00.536
l have a cold. Just a bit of a cold.

29:00.607 --> 29:04.373
ls my nose red?
Oh, it is. lt's red.

29:06.079 --> 29:09.071
Ohh! Oh.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.378
What's that?
You don't know?

29:11.451 --> 29:13.385
l don't either.
Let's find out.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.888
Taxi!

29:16.956 --> 29:19.891
Try on you.
Give it to me.

29:22.729 --> 29:25.664
lt's working very well.

29:25.732 --> 29:27.859
Let's see what else we have.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.164
Look at some of this stuff.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.609
Bee kisses.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.694
Hi.

29:55.762 --> 29:57.696
- Hi.
- You mind if l sit down?

30:23.690 --> 30:27.626
Hah? Well, then,
hello, hello.

30:27.694 --> 30:29.218
Oh, look at--

30:42.075 --> 30:45.067
Yee-haah!
Yee-haah!

30:45.144 --> 30:49.171
Whoa! Whoa!
Yee-haah!

30:49.248 --> 30:51.842
Come on, buddy!
Whee-haah!

30:53.086 --> 30:55.680
What is going on here?

31:09.302 --> 31:11.862
Sit down.

31:11.938 --> 31:15.465
Get in your beds right now.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.509
Sit down! Sit down!

31:19.712 --> 31:23.011
Lie down in your beds
right now!

31:23.082 --> 31:26.347
- l've checked up on you, Hunter.
- Patch.

31:26.419 --> 31:29.354
Hunter, Dr. Prack was
a colleague of mine at Bringham.

31:29.422 --> 31:31.856
He tells me
you have a brilliant mind...

31:31.924 --> 31:36.452
and, like many brilliant people,
you don't necessarily think
the rules apply to you.

31:36.529 --> 31:39.965
Not all the rules, sir, but the Golden
Rule, l think that applies to everyone.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.966
Don't you, sir?

31:42.034 --> 31:46.198
l've also heard you have
a real passion to be a doctor, Hunter.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.206
Patch.

31:48.274 --> 31:52.176
Truth of it is, Hunter,
passion doesn't make doctors.

31:52.245 --> 31:54.645
l make doctors.

31:54.714 --> 31:56.648
Understood?

31:56.716 --> 31:59.207
- Understood.
- Good.

31:59.285 --> 32:04.077
Medical students, as a rule,
have no contact with patients
until the third year.

32:04.478 --> 32:06.002
- ls that clear?
- lt is, sir, but don't you think--

32:06.079 --> 32:10.516
Our way of doing things
is a product of centuries of experience.

32:12.019 --> 32:13.953
lt's all there for a reason.

32:17.524 --> 32:19.958
lt's my hospital.

32:20.027 --> 32:22.962
l know everything
that goes on inside of it.

32:24.698 --> 32:26.632
Everything.

32:28.568 --> 32:30.502
Deviation of the tongue.

32:30.570 --> 32:32.538
- A problem with the cranial nerve.
- Which side?

32:32.606 --> 32:35.040
- Right side, tenth nerve.
- Twelfth nerve.

32:35.108 --> 32:38.043
Do you know how many billions of dollars
are wasted on malpractice insurance?

32:38.111 --> 32:41.046
That's money that goes to lawyers
that could go to patients.

32:41.114 --> 32:45.210
- Hi, guys. Sorry l'm late.
- Everybody know Carin Fisher,
Adelane's roommate?

32:45.285 --> 32:48.220
l invited her to join
our study group.

32:50.390 --> 32:53.325
So, Carin, why do you
want to be a doctor?

32:53.393 --> 32:56.328
ls it just me, or do we
have a lot of work to do?

32:56.396 --> 32:58.921
lt's just a question.
l think it's the question.

32:58.999 --> 33:01.661
Actually, l don't find the question
here in the outline.

33:01.735 --> 33:04.067
- What page are you on?
- Uh, 1432.

33:04.137 --> 33:05.900
Deviation of a tongue.

33:05.973 --> 33:08.533
We'd learn more if we were
working closely with patients.

33:08.608 --> 33:11.702
That's why we're studying--
to learn enough to help the patients.

33:11.778 --> 33:14.212
Adelane, don't waste your breath.

33:14.281 --> 33:16.215
Don't you th--

33:16.283 --> 33:18.615
Don't you think
l see through you?

33:18.685 --> 33:21.620
You act like you're above the system
when you're really just a nonconformist.

33:21.688 --> 33:23.622
You have to get
under the fingernails...

33:23.690 --> 33:26.124
of any authority figure
that crosses your path...

33:26.193 --> 33:28.423
as a way of dealing
with some insecurity.

33:28.495 --> 33:30.429
Antisocial personality, l believe.
lntriguing diagnosis.

33:30.497 --> 33:34.126
Truman, this isn't funny. Smart people
flunk out of here all the time.

33:34.201 --> 33:38.604
Yeah, uh, odds are one of
the five of us sitting here, actually.

33:38.672 --> 33:40.606
l have another question.

33:40.674 --> 33:42.608
ln a perfect system...

33:42.676 --> 33:45.110
why are patients referred to
by their disease...

33:45.178 --> 33:48.113
as in ''that interesting
cancer patient,''
and not by their name?

33:48.181 --> 33:51.275
- lt certainly isn't to be mean.
lt's to prevent transference.
- And why is that bad?

33:51.351 --> 33:54.752
- And the one flunking out is?
- Can we get back to the tongue?

33:54.821 --> 33:57.756
What if a doctor becomes
emotionally involved with a patient?

33:57.824 --> 33:59.758
Does a doctor explode?
No.

33:59.826 --> 34:01.691
Who came up
with these rules?

34:01.762 --> 34:03.696
lt's against the Hippocratic oath,
l think.

34:03.764 --> 34:06.699
l don't really have time for this.
Sorry.

34:08.301 --> 34:10.063
Bye.

34:10.137 --> 34:12.071
- Bye.
- Sorry.

34:12.139 --> 34:14.300
- Charming.
- Bye.

34:14.373 --> 34:16.308
- Truman?
- Yeah.

34:16.376 --> 34:20.312
- l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to stop you from studying.
- Go away!

34:20.380 --> 34:23.815
l believe there's more to being
a doctor than memorizing facts
about the ventricular artery.

34:23.884 --> 34:26.819
l don't care what you think.
l care about my biology test.

34:26.887 --> 34:29.822
- Maybe l could help you.
l read the bio book.
- The whole book?

34:29.889 --> 34:31.824
Oh, yeah.
Now l'm on to Whitman.

34:31.891 --> 34:35.328
You can get Leaves of Grass
at the bookstore if you have
a 20% student l.D. card.

34:35.395 --> 34:38.592
- l don't want Walt Whitman.
- He wouldn't want you either.
He was a homosexual.

34:38.665 --> 34:41.463
But that's not relevant. What's relevant
is that he was a medical man.

34:41.534 --> 34:44.333
He was a nurse in the Civil War
and wrote great poetry.

34:44.404 --> 34:46.964
''Afoot and lighthearted,
l take to the open road--''

34:47.040 --> 34:49.975
Look, l'm not sure
if you've noticed this...

34:50.043 --> 34:54.639
but in a class of 163 students
there are eight women-- eight.

34:54.714 --> 34:58.650
l've had to work really hard
to get here, and l'm gonna have
to work even harder to stay...

34:58.718 --> 35:02.552
and l'm not about to blow it
by wasting my time on your
flighty theories of goodness.

35:02.622 --> 35:05.853
l'm here to learn about medicine.
Period.

35:05.926 --> 35:07.860
Excuse me.

35:09.362 --> 35:12.297
l think somebody is
running away from something.

35:12.365 --> 35:15.823
Why can't it just be that
l'm running away from you?

35:35.722 --> 35:37.155
Hi.

35:41.394 --> 35:44.261
Very nice. Very nice.

35:48.869 --> 35:50.860
Do l look thin to you?

35:50.937 --> 35:53.872
'Cause l'm tryin' to lose
a little weight.

35:53.940 --> 35:55.908
ls this too much?
Have l gone too far?

35:55.976 --> 35:58.308
l got a boner.

35:58.378 --> 36:00.107
l am a boner.

36:10.924 --> 36:13.358
Donner, party of 50!

36:13.426 --> 36:16.953
Donner! Donner party! Over here!

36:17.030 --> 36:19.464
l don't know what's wrong here.

36:19.533 --> 36:23.367
l'm tryin' to light
the dials here, but, uh...

36:23.436 --> 36:26.428
bottom line is,
your TV's broken here.

36:28.642 --> 36:32.043
My name is
Officer Patty O'Furniture.

36:32.112 --> 36:35.047
l'm here today to talk to you
briefly about narcolepsy.

36:35.115 --> 36:37.583
Narcolepsy--

36:37.651 --> 36:38.982
Clown salute!

36:39.052 --> 36:42.146
Very good!

36:42.222 --> 36:43.814
Wide face!

36:45.158 --> 36:47.126
Fart face!

36:48.862 --> 36:52.298
The hospital will cover
all of your bills.

36:52.365 --> 36:54.299
Any other questions?

36:54.367 --> 36:57.768
My name is Doctor... Phil.

36:57.837 --> 37:00.829
l'll be your surgeon--
Oh, there you are.

37:00.907 --> 37:04.502
Ha ha ha! Hey!
Let's get ready to party!

37:08.148 --> 37:11.481
Grazie! Hey! Grazie!

37:11.551 --> 37:13.519
- Grazie! Now take a bow!

37:36.676 --> 37:39.110
Don't believe
everything you read.

37:39.179 --> 37:42.376
Looks like you didn't need
that study group after all.

37:42.449 --> 37:45.384
Well, it's no 98,
but l'm still here.

37:45.452 --> 37:47.386
Yeah.

37:47.454 --> 37:50.014
- Excuse me.
- Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

37:50.090 --> 37:51.819
Excuse me.

37:54.327 --> 37:57.763
- You know, this completely
disrupts my point of view.
- Mm-hmm.

37:57.831 --> 38:00.698
lt was so much more convenient
thinking of you as an idiot.

38:00.767 --> 38:03.201
- Don't count me out yet.
- lt's frustrating.

38:03.270 --> 38:06.637
l study all night, and l'm barely
hanging on by my fingernails.

38:06.706 --> 38:09.641
Oh, forget about that. l want to
show you something that's extraordinary.

38:11.711 --> 38:14.043
- An enema bulb?
- lt used to be.

38:14.114 --> 38:16.548
This amazing piece of rubber...

38:16.616 --> 38:18.846
when applied to your face...

38:18.918 --> 38:21.011
can brighten
another person's day.

38:22.088 --> 38:24.522
Even a suffering patient.

38:24.591 --> 38:28.027
- l'm sure it's really great
for kids, but--
- No, not just kids. Anybody.

38:28.094 --> 38:30.028
Patients are opening up
to me, Carin.

38:30.096 --> 38:32.030
They're sharing their dreams,
their fantasies...

38:32.098 --> 38:34.532
and if you hit on
the right topic...

38:34.601 --> 38:36.865
they brighten up
for one brief moment.

38:36.936 --> 38:38.870
They don't concentrate
on the pain.

38:38.938 --> 38:42.066
They don't even feel the pain.

38:42.142 --> 38:44.076
- Try it on.
- No, thank you.

38:44.144 --> 38:47.409
l want you to try it on and help me.
Just try it on.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.415
lf you don't laugh,
you'll never see it again.

38:50.483 --> 38:53.452
But if you do,
you have to help me.

38:53.520 --> 38:55.454
Just try it on.

38:59.326 --> 39:01.191
Hmm.

39:02.629 --> 39:05.462
You didn't say anything about a mirror.

39:07.167 --> 39:09.761
Who do you think
you look like?

39:11.004 --> 39:12.801
Karl Malden?

39:15.175 --> 39:17.700
You cheated.

39:18.945 --> 39:20.913
You can take the nose off now.

39:22.182 --> 39:24.116
So, what's the favor?

39:54.481 --> 39:56.415
Psst.

39:57.717 --> 39:59.184
Ready?

40:05.692 --> 40:07.819
Dumbo incoming!

40:11.598 --> 40:14.533
Bag 'im, Bwana!

40:16.936 --> 40:19.029
Killer poodle! You got lucky!

40:19.105 --> 40:22.040
Piranha fish!
Yea! Very good!

40:22.108 --> 40:24.975
Man down!

40:27.380 --> 40:29.575
- What was that?
- lt's nothing.

40:29.649 --> 40:31.583
Should l go check?

40:31.651 --> 40:33.585
l said, it's nothin'.

40:39.092 --> 40:41.060
One last one!

40:41.127 --> 40:43.357
Oww!

40:47.967 --> 40:51.403
Well, congratulations, Jackie.

40:51.471 --> 40:54.702
You've done it all. You've nailed
every balloon from here to Timbuktu.

40:56.776 --> 40:59.711
That was incredible, Patch.

40:59.779 --> 41:01.747
Almost as good
as the real thing.

41:04.150 --> 41:06.584
One last safari.

41:06.653 --> 41:08.587
That's all l wanted.

41:10.290 --> 41:13.987
Thank you, Truman.
Both of you.

41:14.060 --> 41:15.994
That was wonderful.

41:16.062 --> 41:19.498
Yes, it's been
a long time for me.

41:19.566 --> 41:22.729
What about you, dear?
What's your fantasy?

41:22.802 --> 41:24.895
Oh.

41:24.971 --> 41:26.905
When l was a little girl...

41:26.973 --> 41:31.273
whenever my mother
would cook spaghetti...

41:31.344 --> 41:36.714
she would let me reach into the pot
and squeeze the noodles.

41:36.783 --> 41:38.512
Oh!

41:39.652 --> 41:41.847
l've always wanted...

41:41.921 --> 41:45.584
to be in a swimming pool
full of noodles...

41:45.658 --> 41:49.094
wall-to-wall
and top-to-bottom.

41:49.162 --> 41:54.099
An entire pool
full of noodles.

41:55.468 --> 41:57.732
Oh.

41:57.804 --> 41:59.738
How about a poodle?

42:01.274 --> 42:04.710
And the award for valor goes to
Truman Schiff and his red welt.

42:04.777 --> 42:08.713
- Thank you, Truman.
- Located just above my
nasal bone, adjacent to my--

42:08.781 --> 42:10.715
- Glabella!
- Whoo!
- Glabella!

42:10.783 --> 42:12.774
Good night, Truman.

42:14.454 --> 42:16.388
Right.

42:16.456 --> 42:19.391
Fun's fun, kids, but my welt
and l have a study date...

42:19.459 --> 42:21.893
with the autonomic nerves
of the thorax.

42:21.961 --> 42:24.896
- Good luck. Watch out
for the circle of Willis.
- Good luck to you.

42:24.964 --> 42:27.899
And our next award, in the tradition
of the great poodle handlers...

42:27.967 --> 42:29.901
where no actual transference
took place--

42:29.969 --> 42:34.133
All right. What you did in there,
it was very nice, l admit.

42:34.207 --> 42:37.142
Whoa. ls that a little ice
that just chipped off?

42:37.210 --> 42:40.145
- You're never serious, are you?
- No. l tried that for years.

42:40.213 --> 42:42.647
Never really worked for me.

42:42.715 --> 42:44.649
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:44.717 --> 42:46.651
Oh.

42:46.719 --> 42:49.654
Well, l'd better go hit
the thorax as well, so--

42:49.722 --> 42:51.656
l have a crush on you.

42:51.724 --> 42:55.711
Ha! l can't believe l just
blurted that out.

42:55.845 --> 42:59.144
Look, thank you for
taking me along tonight.

42:59.215 --> 43:01.775
l actually had fun.

43:01.851 --> 43:03.478
Good night.

43:03.553 --> 43:05.214
Wait a minute.

43:05.288 --> 43:08.451
When l said l had a crush on you,
you didn't say...

43:08.524 --> 43:11.049
''No way, loser.
l'd rather have a lobotomy by a leper.''

43:11.127 --> 43:12.719
That means something.

43:12.795 --> 43:16.754
Maybe l was just being polite
and l didn't want to hurt your feelings.

43:16.832 --> 43:19.130
But you're not polite.
You're rude.

43:19.201 --> 43:21.135
Sometimes you're downright bitchy.

43:22.371 --> 43:24.305
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:39.555 --> 43:42.991
Dr. Hyer, please dial the pharmacy.

44:08.584 --> 44:10.848
Blue skies

44:10.920 --> 44:13.184
Shining on me

44:13.255 --> 44:15.883
Nothin' but blue skies

44:15.958 --> 44:18.449
Do l see

44:18.527 --> 44:20.461
Bluebirds

44:20.529 --> 44:22.156
Singin' a song

44:22.231 --> 44:25.428
- Are you a doctor?
- No. l'm a medical student.

44:25.501 --> 44:28.937
But if there's anything
l can do to help you--

44:29.005 --> 44:31.940
- You wanna help me?
- Oh, yeah. What can l do?

44:32.008 --> 44:33.942
Listen, you little
do-gooder prick.

44:34.010 --> 44:36.945
lf you wanna make yourself feel good,
don't make me pay for it.

44:37.013 --> 44:39.504
Now get out of here,
'cause you don't help shit!

45:02.638 --> 45:05.402
Dr. Maslow, line 214, please.

45:05.474 --> 45:07.908
Dr. Maslow, line 214.

45:09.845 --> 45:12.939
Yo! Ride 'em, cowboy!
Whoo-hoo!

45:13.015 --> 45:16.212
Yea!

45:18.788 --> 45:21.916
Oh! Oh! l surrender!
l'll tell you what you want to know!

45:21.991 --> 45:24.926
Do you wanna tell me what it is
you think you're doing?

45:26.395 --> 45:27.862
Oh.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.234
Uh...

45:33.302 --> 45:35.236
just getting
a few laughs, sir.

45:37.039 --> 45:39.974
The American Journal of Medicine
has found that laughter...

45:40.042 --> 45:42.067
increases secretion
of catecholamines and endorphins...

45:42.144 --> 45:44.408
which in turn increases oxygenation
of the blood, relaxes the arteries...

45:44.480 --> 45:47.415
speeds up the heart,
decreases blood pressure...

45:47.483 --> 45:50.418
which has a positive effect
on all cardiovascular
and respiratory ailments...

45:50.486 --> 45:53.580
as well as overall increasing
the immune system response.

46:01.397 --> 46:03.126
Smart clown, eh?

46:08.003 --> 46:09.903
Mr. Adams.

46:09.972 --> 46:12.907
When l told you
l knew Dr. Prack...

46:12.975 --> 46:16.911
did l mislead you in some way
to think l'm a pushover, like he is?

46:16.979 --> 46:19.413
Kindly remove that coat.

46:19.482 --> 46:23.350
l told you you are not to see
the patients till the third year.

46:23.419 --> 46:25.353
l'm just visiting friends, sir.

46:25.421 --> 46:27.355
Why are you here?

46:27.423 --> 46:30.358
lf you want to be a clown,
go join the circus.

46:30.426 --> 46:33.361
Patients don't need to be entertained.
They don't need a friend.

46:33.429 --> 46:36.364
They need a doctor.

46:36.432 --> 46:39.401
l don't want to see you
in this hospital again.

46:39.468 --> 46:43.165
What if l visit the patients
on my own time?

46:43.239 --> 46:46.174
Yes, about your own time.

46:46.242 --> 46:49.473
lt's been brought to our attention
that perhaps we should be suspicious...

46:49.545 --> 46:51.479
of the level
of your grades.

46:51.547 --> 46:53.447
What are you saying?
l'm cheating?

46:53.516 --> 46:57.179
Your scores are among the top in
your class, yet you never seem to study.

46:57.253 --> 46:59.221
That's ridiculous.

46:59.288 --> 47:01.688
Your classmates
don't seem to think so.

47:01.757 --> 47:04.157
Really. Who?

47:04.226 --> 47:08.322
l'm warning you.
Stay out of this hospital.

47:19.642 --> 47:21.576
You told Walcott l cheated.

47:21.644 --> 47:24.579
l know you did it.
Just tell me why.

47:24.647 --> 47:26.581
Look, cut the crap, Hunter.

47:26.649 --> 47:29.584
l live with you. l know how much
you study, or don't study.

47:29.652 --> 47:33.213
And you do better than me?
Give me a break.

47:33.289 --> 47:38.226
You arrogant, pompous prick!
Who appointed you custodian
of the medical profession?

47:38.294 --> 47:42.162
ls it because your father
and his father was a doctor,
some sort of genetic thing?

47:42.231 --> 47:44.324
- You're damn right.
- Really?

47:44.400 --> 47:46.334
l grew up with it.

47:46.402 --> 47:49.860
l know what it takes to look in the eyes
of dying people day after day...

47:49.939 --> 47:51.873
and come home
for dinner at night.

47:51.941 --> 47:55.206
- l know what it takes.
You don't have it.
- Oh, really. And you do?

47:55.277 --> 47:58.007
lf you don't like me,
just say it.

47:58.080 --> 48:00.173
l don't like you!

48:00.249 --> 48:03.582
Why don't you like me?
You're a prick, and l like you.

48:03.652 --> 48:05.779
Because you make
my effort a joke!

48:05.855 --> 48:09.188
l want to be a doctor!
This isn't a game to me!

48:09.258 --> 48:11.453
This isn't playtime!

48:11.527 --> 48:14.291
This is serious business!

48:14.363 --> 48:17.924
l have it in me
to be a great doctor...

48:18.000 --> 48:21.697
but in order to do that l have to
sacrifice if l want to be better.

48:21.770 --> 48:23.704
''Better.''
Better than me, hmm?

48:23.772 --> 48:26.707
l will save lives that
could have otherwise not been saved.

48:26.775 --> 48:30.211
Now, l could be like you and go around
laughing and have a good time, ha ha...

48:30.279 --> 48:33.214
but l prefer to learn,
because the more l learn...

48:33.282 --> 48:36.479
the more likely l will
have the right answer at the
crucial moment and save a life.

48:36.552 --> 48:39.282
And you say l'm a prick?
You say l'm a prick?

48:39.355 --> 48:41.289
You know, maybe l am...

48:41.357 --> 48:44.292
but you ask the average person, when
death comes knocking at their door...

48:44.360 --> 48:47.796
whether they want a prick on their side
or some kindergarten teacher...

48:47.863 --> 48:49.797
who's gonna kiss their ass!

48:49.865 --> 48:52.800
Because when that day comes
l want the prick...

48:52.868 --> 48:54.802
and so will you.

49:05.881 --> 49:09.214
You know, l forget
how young you are, Mitch...

49:09.285 --> 49:12.379
that you think you have to be a prick
to get things done...

49:12.454 --> 49:15.890
and that you actually think
that that's a new idea.

49:29.672 --> 49:33.108
You know what l oughta do?
Take it to the state medical board.

49:33.175 --> 49:36.941
There's gotta be some constitutional
right for visiting the sick.

49:40.549 --> 49:42.483
Why don't you
say anything?

49:42.551 --> 49:44.815
Sorry, Patch.

49:44.887 --> 49:46.821
l think Walcott
has a point.

49:46.889 --> 49:48.652
lt's a hospital.

49:48.724 --> 49:51.818
People are suffering
and dying.

49:51.894 --> 49:56.797
We're all dying, Truman.
Our job is to increase health.

49:56.865 --> 49:58.799
You know what that means?

49:58.867 --> 50:01.995
That means improving the quality
of life, not just delaying death.

50:03.505 --> 50:05.439
Either way, l--

50:05.507 --> 50:10.843
For your own sake, l th-- l think you
should just lay low for a while.

50:12.314 --> 50:14.248
Maybe you're right.

50:40.075 --> 50:43.567
Preview of coming attractions.

50:43.645 --> 50:45.579
Nurse.

50:45.647 --> 50:51.948
''Death. To die. To expire.
To pass on. To perish.''

50:52.449 --> 50:53.882
To peg out. To push up daisies.
To push up posies.

50:53.950 --> 50:55.747
To become extinct.

50:55.819 --> 51:00.085
Curtains, deceased, demised,
departed and defunct.

51:00.157 --> 51:02.182
Dead as a doornail.
Dead as a herring.

51:02.259 --> 51:04.750
Dead as a mutton.
Dead as nits.

51:04.828 --> 51:09.561
The last breath. Paying a debt
to nature. The big sleep.

51:09.633 --> 51:12.761
God's way of saying,
''Slow down.''

51:25.148 --> 51:27.082
To check out.

51:30.253 --> 51:32.721
To shuffle off
this mortal coil.

51:32.789 --> 51:35.053
To head for
the happy hunting ground.

51:35.125 --> 51:37.719
To blink for an exceptionally long
period of time.

51:37.794 --> 51:40.285
To find oneself
without breath.

51:40.363 --> 51:44.129
- To be the incredible decaying man.
- Worm buffet.

51:44.201 --> 51:46.226
- Kick the bucket.
- Buy the farm.

51:46.303 --> 51:48.601
- Take the cab.
- Cash in your chips.

51:48.672 --> 51:51.539
And if we bury you ass up,
we have a place to park my bike.

51:54.277 --> 51:58.213
Whoo! Comin' out of chute number nine,
ridin' that morphine pony!

51:58.281 --> 52:00.146
Whoo-aaah!

52:00.217 --> 52:02.981
Come on now.
Hey, yeah

52:03.053 --> 52:05.988
Let's check out the maternity ward.
You know those chicks put out.

52:07.891 --> 52:12.988
Here we see that the vitreous body
is composed of a transparent jelly...

52:13.063 --> 52:14.997
with a mesh
of collagen fibers.

52:15.065 --> 52:16.999
Lights, please.

52:17.067 --> 52:21.128
Uh, before we adjourn
Dean Walcott has a brief announcement.

52:21.204 --> 52:23.331
He's gonna have the sex change!

52:24.641 --> 52:26.575
Next Monday
the hospital is hosting...

52:26.643 --> 52:28.907
a medical
seminar-slash-retreat...

52:28.979 --> 52:32.278
for the Fellowship of the
American College of Gynecologists.

52:32.349 --> 52:34.340
l'll get the strippers.

52:34.417 --> 52:37.909
lt is important that they
be received in a manner suitable
to their status and position.

52:37.988 --> 52:42.254
l have traditionally selected
an outstanding student...

52:42.325 --> 52:44.418
to head
the welcoming committee.

52:44.494 --> 52:47.588
The time demands are great,
and l wouldn't want to jeopardize...

52:47.664 --> 52:50.599
the academic performance
of a weaker student.

52:50.667 --> 52:53.033
This year l have chosen...

52:53.103 --> 52:54.798
Hunter Adams.

52:54.871 --> 52:56.805
Oh. Well, thank you.

52:56.873 --> 52:58.363
Hunter...

52:58.441 --> 53:01.808
there's a detailed list
of instructions in my office.

53:01.878 --> 53:06.508
Oh, and, uh, the auditorium
could use a good cleaning.

53:13.223 --> 53:17.489
Did you hear him? ''ln a style according
to their stature and position.''

53:17.560 --> 53:21.997
''l am a great doctor!
Worship me! Spread before me!

53:22.065 --> 53:24.499
Who dares stand?''

53:24.567 --> 53:28.833
You know what l'm thinking? Maybe we
should decorate with a western motif.

53:28.905 --> 53:30.839
How about that?
Ah.

53:30.907 --> 53:33.842
Something with stirrups
and a big banner that says...

53:33.910 --> 53:36.845
''Howdy, gyneroos!
Dilated to meet ya!''

53:36.913 --> 53:39.848
- How about that?
- How about just doing it straight?

53:39.916 --> 53:42.851
- What do you mean?
- As in, straight to graduation.

53:42.919 --> 53:48.016
Oh. lf anybody has a problem with this,
please, just walk away right now.

53:52.929 --> 53:55.056
Oh.

53:55.131 --> 53:57.065
All right.

53:57.133 --> 53:59.567
Wow! Yes!

53:59.636 --> 54:01.627
Okay.

54:09.412 --> 54:11.346
They're right on time.

54:11.414 --> 54:13.678
Good morning, Doctor.
Welcome to campus. Good to see you.

54:13.750 --> 54:15.684
How you doing, Doctor?

54:15.752 --> 54:19.347
Uh, gentlemen, l believe that
you'll find the facilities here...

54:19.422 --> 54:21.515
are just perfect
for your purposes today.

54:21.591 --> 54:24.526
We have everything set up
in the auditorium.

54:24.594 --> 54:26.528
lf you'd just follow me--

54:33.336 --> 54:35.861
Welcome, cold-handed ones.

54:35.939 --> 54:39.067
lt's an honor
to greet-slash-welcome...

54:39.142 --> 54:43.306
so many who have touched so many women
is such a powerful way.

54:43.380 --> 54:45.314
Come on in.

54:45.382 --> 54:47.316
Watch out.
lt's a little slippery.

54:47.384 --> 54:50.820
And if you think
it's hot out there-- Whoa!

54:50.887 --> 54:54.254
Come on!

54:54.324 --> 54:56.918
Get him
in my office now.

54:59.496 --> 55:01.691
All right, gentlemen,
if, uh-- Ahem--

55:01.765 --> 55:03.699
if you'd
just follow me.

55:21.551 --> 55:23.849
You wanted
to see me, sir?

55:25.088 --> 55:27.022
You are dismissed.

55:27.090 --> 55:28.853
Sir.

55:28.925 --> 55:31.359
From this school.

55:31.428 --> 55:33.362
Kindly remove your things...

55:33.430 --> 55:35.762
and vacate the school premises
as soon as possible.

55:35.832 --> 55:37.527
What for?

55:37.600 --> 55:40.535
For asking a group of doctors to have
a sense of humor about themselves?

55:40.603 --> 55:43.538
Oh, l have a sense of humor, Hunter.

55:43.606 --> 55:46.541
l find it hilarious that,
as smart as you are...

55:46.609 --> 55:50.306
you could give me an airtight reason
to throw you the hell out of here!

55:50.380 --> 55:53.838
Why am l such a threat
to you, sir?

55:53.917 --> 55:57.614
Because what you want
is for us to get down there
on the same level as our patients...

55:57.687 --> 55:59.621
to destroy objectivity...

55:59.689 --> 56:02.624
all to uphold some
idealistic buddy system...

56:02.692 --> 56:07.459
that will allow you to work through
your own feelings of inadequacy.

56:11.034 --> 56:13.366
What you have done here today...

56:13.436 --> 56:15.370
is inexcusable.

56:15.438 --> 56:18.965
You have made a complete mockery
out of our distinguished guests.

56:19.042 --> 56:24.139
lf you think that l will further
tolerate your blatant disregard
of the bylaws of this--

56:25.281 --> 56:27.215
What are you smiling at?

56:27.283 --> 56:29.911
ls this all
a big joke to you?

56:29.986 --> 56:32.250
Get out of here!

56:42.632 --> 56:45.567
Blatant disregard for
school code and procedure.

56:45.635 --> 56:48.069
Defying direct orders
from a dean.

56:48.138 --> 56:51.073
And l am aware
of your creative efforts...

56:51.141 --> 56:54.076
to make sure our visiting gynecologists
feel right at home.

56:54.144 --> 56:58.843
- Now, what is it you'd
like me to do for you?
- l want to graduate, sir.

56:58.915 --> 57:00.780
Dean Walcott
thinks otherwise...

57:00.850 --> 57:03.250
but my grades
are way above par.

57:03.319 --> 57:06.254
l want to finish school
so l can become a doctor.

57:06.322 --> 57:09.257
Well, l'm gonna give this
to you real straight.

57:09.325 --> 57:12.260
l have a hospital and a medical school
to run here.

57:12.328 --> 57:14.455
l have to trust the people
in my employ...

57:14.531 --> 57:17.466
otherwise their quality of life
will turn to shit.

57:17.534 --> 57:20.025
Their life turns to shit,
my life turns to shit. Do you follow?

57:20.103 --> 57:23.038
- Yes.
- Good.

57:23.106 --> 57:27.372
Now, uh, Dean Walcott is a--
a pain in the ass...

57:27.443 --> 57:31.971
but l depend on him to keep me up to
speed on what's going on around here...

57:32.048 --> 57:35.484
and l would never take the word
of any student over his.

57:36.619 --> 57:38.280
However...

57:38.354 --> 57:42.290
l also have a source
that informs me that your antics...

57:42.358 --> 57:45.293
have improved the quality of life
for the patients.

57:45.361 --> 57:48.296
They don't complain as much,
they take less medication...

57:48.364 --> 57:51.458
and, uh, what's-his-name over in 305
has not thrown his bedpan at a nurse...

57:51.534 --> 57:53.468
in over a week.

57:53.536 --> 57:56.232
- lt's Bill.
- Yeah, whatever.

57:56.306 --> 57:59.673
So, from now on you will not
enter that hospital...

57:59.742 --> 58:03.269
unless under the supervision of the
attendant, as part of the curriculum...

58:03.346 --> 58:07.077
and you will steer clear
of Dean Walcott.

58:07.150 --> 58:10.813
Yes, sir.
So l'm still in school?

58:10.887 --> 58:12.821
l wouldn't
send my laundry out...

58:12.889 --> 58:15.414
but, uh, you just
don't screw up, huh?

58:30.258 --> 58:33.227
Come in. Please come in.

58:33.295 --> 58:35.786
Hello?

58:35.864 --> 58:38.332
- Hello.
- Patch?

58:38.400 --> 58:40.834
- Welcome.
- What are you doing?

58:40.902 --> 58:44.861
- l thought we were studying.
- We're studying cellular biology.

58:44.939 --> 58:47.806
Where are you?

58:47.876 --> 58:49.810
Somewhere.

58:49.878 --> 58:52.210
Surprise!

58:52.280 --> 58:54.771
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

58:54.849 --> 58:56.817
l don't believe this.
Where is he?

58:56.885 --> 58:59.376
- l just saw him around here somewhere.
- Where is he, Truman?

58:59.454 --> 59:01.979
He's here. You gotta find him.

59:02.057 --> 59:03.991
- Patch?
- Ha-ha!

59:07.629 --> 59:10.689
''l do not love you as if
you were a salt rose or topaz...

59:10.765 --> 59:14.496
or the air o'er carnations
that fire shoots off.

59:14.569 --> 59:17.197
l love you as certain dark
things are to be loved...

59:17.272 --> 59:20.673
in secret 'tween
the shadow and the soul.''

59:23.178 --> 59:25.112
We'll finish it later.

59:26.247 --> 59:29.239
What the hell is this?
Hunter.

59:29.317 --> 59:31.376
Hunter, please answer me!

59:31.453 --> 59:34.616
Stop laughing! Truman, l see you!

59:34.689 --> 59:38.489
Who the hell are you? You aren't--

59:38.560 --> 59:40.755
Oh! Oh, damn it!

59:40.829 --> 59:45.459
l hurt my ankle!
Somebody get somebody please!

59:45.533 --> 59:49.299
Someone-- Hello? My ankle!

59:49.371 --> 59:52.465
You could have saved yourself
a lot of trouble and just asked me out.

59:52.540 --> 59:55.976
Who said anything
about asking you out?

59:57.112 --> 59:59.239
l heard something
about you.

59:59.314 --> 01:00:02.215
- That l was in a mental hospital?
- ls it true?

01:00:02.283 --> 01:00:04.217
Tried to kill myself.

01:00:04.285 --> 01:00:07.413
The mental ward was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:13.484
- What did the doctors do to help you?
- The doctors didn't help me.

01:00:13.561 --> 01:00:16.086
The patients helped me.

01:00:16.164 --> 01:00:20.658
They helped me realize
that by helping them l could
forget about my own problems.

01:00:20.735 --> 01:00:24.637
And l did.
l really helped some of them.

01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:28.107
lt was an incredible
feeling, Carin.

01:00:29.244 --> 01:00:32.475
There was one patient
named Rudy.

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:35.539
l helped him
be able to pee.

01:00:35.617 --> 01:00:40.020
But for the first time in my life,
l forgot about my own problems.

01:00:40.088 --> 01:00:42.420
lt was an incredible high.

01:00:44.692 --> 01:00:46.626
What?

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:52.960
lt's just that, um, somebody,
you know, could do for me...

01:00:53.034 --> 01:00:56.800
what you did for me tonight
after the way l've treated you.

01:00:56.871 --> 01:01:00.671
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

01:01:05.747 --> 01:01:07.681
Thank you.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.684
Good night.

01:01:13.888 --> 01:01:18.120
No, this is not a good night.
This is a great night!

01:01:18.193 --> 01:01:20.821
You know?

01:01:52.227 --> 01:01:55.219
Hi, l'm John the Baptist.
Any calls?

01:01:55.296 --> 01:01:58.197
l've been trying
to reach you.

01:01:59.534 --> 01:02:02.560
l love you.

01:02:04.639 --> 01:02:07.233
Let's go outside. Okay?

01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:27.025
Hey, Bill.

01:02:27.095 --> 01:02:29.893
Turquoise is a nice color
on you.

01:02:34.469 --> 01:02:37.404
You don't have to say anything.
l know l look good.

01:02:40.408 --> 01:02:42.342
My boys.

01:02:44.479 --> 01:02:47.039
My boys are beautiful, hmm?

01:02:47.115 --> 01:02:50.243
- Yeah.
- Did you see my boys?

01:02:50.318 --> 01:02:52.309
Yeah.

01:02:53.388 --> 01:02:56.721
She's not bad either.

01:02:56.791 --> 01:02:59.726
You think after you're gone,
maybe l could--

01:03:02.764 --> 01:03:07.326
Oh, you're killin' me here,
Patch.

01:03:16.344 --> 01:03:20.178
S-Sing me that stupid song.

01:03:24.919 --> 01:03:28.377
Blue skies smilin' at me

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:31.118
Nothin' but blue skies

01:03:31.192 --> 01:03:34.127
Do l see

01:03:34.195 --> 01:03:37.392
Bluebirds singin' a song

01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:41.228
Nothin' but bluebirds

01:03:41.302 --> 01:03:43.395
All day long

01:03:54.949 --> 01:03:57.179
Blue days

01:03:58.305 --> 01:04:04.456
