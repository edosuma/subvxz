- It has to be tight.
- Mmm.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.703
You're lucky you're alive.

20:02.870 --> 20:06.039
Let's not tempt fate. Come on.
I'll drive you to the hospital.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.543
No. There's too many people
asking too many questions.

20:09.710 --> 20:12.504
It's better to stay
off the grid.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.967
You don't have to be
doing any of this.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.929
I didn't do enough
when it really counted.

20:21.096 --> 20:23.682
If I had, none of this
would be happening.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.977
You didn't know
what Roman was capable of.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.812
Neither did I.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.732
You did what you could
to stop him.

20:31.899 --> 20:34.026
Let me help.

20:35.569 --> 20:39.615
- We'll go after him together.
- No, this isn't your fight.

20:40.699 --> 20:43.493
The only way to bring Roman down
is for me to turn.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.331
So you'll wait a month,

20:47.497 --> 20:49.583
give you a chance
to get your strength back.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.377
Turning against the moon
exposes you to enormous risk.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.005
You've turned against
the moon before.

20:55.172 --> 20:56.924
This time,
there is no coming back.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.761
You're not the first
of your kind I've run across.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.515

in three days.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.935

it'll be hell on earth.

I really do have to apologise
for our last visit.

uncomfortable with the whole...

I lied to you.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.997

to see how you'd react.

Did I pass?

31:19.671 --> 31:21.798

to travel on my own,

31:21.965 --> 31:23.675
I went looking for him.

31:24.676 --> 31:27.595
He'd been killed
some years before.

31:28.596 --> 31:31.724
They found his body
in the village square.

31:31.891 --> 31:35.979
Things had been done to him,
mutilation and such.

31:46.573 --> 31:49.075
how you'd been planning
to run off together.

31:49.242 --> 31:52.662

to steal a horse

31:52.829 --> 31:54.664
and you never
heard from him again.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.708
Well, I guess now we know why.

31:56.874 --> 32:00.003

left in the centre of town.

32:00.169 --> 32:02.171

32:14.726 --> 32:16.561

32:16.728 --> 32:19.022

"Men leave.
That's what they do."

32:22.525 --> 32:24.360
Isn't that what you told me?

32:28.406 --> 32:30.325
I don't think men leave you.

32:30.491 --> 32:32.910

source of protein

32:38.791 --> 32:40.835

what Dimitri was planning,

32:43.588 --> 32:47.216

do that to my unborn child.

of moss tucked inside sealskin.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.066
They created the most
technologically advanced

35:09.233 --> 35:10.860
diaper of its day.

35:11.027 --> 35:14.739
It was both absorbent
and waterproof.

35:17.700 --> 35:22.079
I see you got yourself a baby
since I saw you last.

35:22.246 --> 35:24.624
Things happen fast around here.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.501
Who is that little person?

35:26.667 --> 35:28.252
Her name is Nadia.

35:28.419 --> 35:32.131
- Nadia?
- My niece.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.551
Back in Elizabethan times,

35:35.718 --> 35:38.471
they didn't change diapers
but once a week.

35:38.638 --> 35:40.431
I often wondered if that's what

35:40.598 --> 35:42.558
kicked off the age
of exploration -

35:42.725 --> 35:45.102
travelling across oceans
to distant lands

35:45.269 --> 35:48.105
to escape the aroma
of young families -

35:48.272 --> 35:49.899
because the history
of toileting's pretty much

35:50.066 --> 35:52.318
the history of everything
when you get right down to it.

35:52.485 --> 35:55.238
For a smart guy who knows
a whole lot about a whole lot,

35:55.404 --> 35:57.073
you're pretty dumb sometimes.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.829
I reached that same conclusion
around Bald Knob, Arkansas.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.500
So you're aware
that it seems to be easier

36:07.667 --> 36:09.710
for you to stand up
in front of 100 people

36:09.877 --> 36:12.296
and open a vein
than it is to talk to me?

36:14.674 --> 36:16.467
I am aware.

36:17.718 --> 36:19.679
And it occurred to me

36:19.846 --> 36:22.306
that telling the truth
to entertain an audience

36:22.473 --> 36:24.517
isn't anywhere near the same

36:24.684 --> 36:27.311
as telling the truth
'cause it's the truth.

36:27.478 --> 36:29.730
It's probably
a good deal less honest.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.858
That is my strong sense.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.322
So is there anything I should
know or that you want to tell me

36:38.489 --> 36:41.576
or do I need to go round up
a few dozen more people?

36:43.536 --> 36:46.664
No. No, that's it.
