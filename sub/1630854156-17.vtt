-Hi.
-Hey, Tina.
How was Thundergirls?

00:24.015 --> 00:27.054
(groans loudly)

00:27.121 --> 00:28.490
-So... good?
-No!

00:28.591 --> 00:31.095
My future is ruined!
I did Thundergirls all wrong!

00:31.162 --> 00:32.832
I'm a Thundergirl disgrace!

00:32.933 --> 00:34.302
A "BlunderGirl"? Sorry.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.605
-(toilet flushing)
-What happened?

00:35.705 --> 00:37.007
I was in the bathroom
and I heard yelling.

00:37.074 --> 00:38.443
How come there's
always someone yelling

00:38.511 --> 00:39.478
when I'm trying
to use the bathroom?

00:39.546 --> 00:40.582
Family tradition?

00:40.648 --> 00:42.017
I'm just upset because
my future is a sick joke

00:42.084 --> 00:43.186
and it's all my fault.

00:43.253 --> 00:45.658
Okay, tell me about it, Tina.
Tell Mama.

00:45.725 --> 00:47.929
I'm just gonna casually zip up
my fly while you're talking.

00:48.029 --> 00:49.533
-Go ahead, sweetie.
-(zipper closes)

00:49.600 --> 00:50.535
Tonight at Thundergirls,

00:50.602 --> 00:52.204
after we made some pretty
badass bookmarks,

00:52.271 --> 00:53.941
we were all heading out
the door to go home

00:54.008 --> 00:55.645
<i>when Troop Leader Ginny said</i>
<i>she wanted to talk to me.</i>

00:55.712 --> 00:57.749
Tina, hey. I've been
meaning to talk to you.

00:57.816 --> 01:00.555
Have you given any thought
to pursuing your Lightning Sash?

01:00.622 --> 01:02.926
Oh, I mean,
the Lightning Sash is

01:02.993 --> 01:04.328
the highest sash
in Thundergirls.

01:04.428 --> 01:06.366
-You need a lot of
badges to earn that.
-Correct.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.071
So, I figured getting it
would be... hard?

01:09.171 --> 01:11.309
It is! But so worth it.

01:11.442 --> 01:13.113
Colleges look at
the Lightning Sash.

01:13.179 --> 01:15.919
NASA likes the Lightning Sash
on a résumé.

01:15.952 --> 01:17.689
So do Fortune 500 companies.

01:17.756 --> 01:19.626
I know what, um, those are...

01:19.660 --> 01:22.498
The top 500
fortune cookie companies?

01:22.599 --> 01:25.838
If I were you, I'd get on it.
Look, you're one of our more...

01:25.939 --> 01:27.943
-seasoned Thundergirls.
-Thank you?

01:28.009 --> 01:29.579
But for someone so seasoned,

01:29.646 --> 01:31.449
you are way behind
on your badge count.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.286
Course I was too at your age.

01:33.386 --> 01:35.591
But you buckled down
and got your Lightning Sash?

01:35.658 --> 01:36.694
I did not.

01:36.794 --> 01:39.065
And I regret it
every day of my damn life.

01:39.131 --> 01:41.135
Sorry for swearing,
a Thundergirl never swears.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.073
Good story.
Especially the profanity.

01:43.139 --> 01:45.110
I was mostly distracted
by Mom's fly.

01:45.177 --> 01:47.147
Yeah, you did not
do a great job, Lin.

01:47.214 --> 01:49.285
Okay, okay, there.
It's all the way up.

01:49.352 --> 01:51.022
-(chuckles) It-It's not.
-Oh.

01:51.089 --> 01:52.859
What the hell's going on
with these pants?

01:52.926 --> 01:54.161
Anyway, keep talking, Tina.

01:54.228 --> 01:56.533
So, you want to get this
Lightning Sash thing?

01:56.634 --> 01:58.169
Now I do. (groans)

01:58.236 --> 01:59.773
I-I've just been having fun
at Thundergirls when

01:59.873 --> 02:01.476
I should have been thinking
about how it could mold

02:01.543 --> 02:03.346
-my whole entire future.
-That's what you get

02:03.413 --> 02:04.549
for being such a party animal.

02:04.616 --> 02:05.985
Wait, so how many badges
do you need

02:06.052 --> 02:07.789
-for your Lightning Sash?
-25.

02:07.856 --> 02:09.358
And how many do you have?

02:09.425 --> 02:12.131
Six. Including the badge you get
just for joining Thundergirls.

02:12.197 --> 02:13.233
The joiner badge.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.437
Aw, my little
Jackie Joyner-Kersee.

02:15.505 --> 02:17.141
And you've been
a Thundergirl forever,

02:17.241 --> 02:19.846
so at this rate,
by the time you get 25 badges,

02:19.946 --> 02:21.817
you'll be...
a million years old?

02:21.917 --> 02:23.253
Oh, no! That's too old.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.925
Tina, listen, you can
still get your lightning thingy.

02:25.992 --> 02:28.463
You're just gonna have to pick
up the pace a bit, you know?

02:28.531 --> 02:30.000
-You're right.
-Thattagirl!

02:30.067 --> 02:32.137
I'll earn a badge a day.
Starting tomorrow.

02:32.237 --> 02:33.741
A badge a day?

02:33.808 --> 02:35.043
Yep. The sooner I get it done,

02:35.110 --> 02:36.245
the sooner I can get
my out-of-control life

02:36.312 --> 02:37.247
back on track.

02:37.314 --> 02:38.483
-Oh, boy.
-Okay...

02:38.584 --> 02:40.120
Let's go alphabetically.
Archery badge.

02:40.187 --> 02:41.590
I can rip through that one
really fast.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.159
Yes, please, can we be
an archery family?

02:43.259 --> 02:45.798
Uh, I mean,
"ripping through archery"

02:45.865 --> 02:47.001
just sounds like a bad idea.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.305
Rapping through archery though,
that could be something.

02:49.405 --> 02:51.610
What rhymes with "archery"?
"Fart-chery"?

02:51.677 --> 02:52.779
Okay, how about, uh...

02:52.879 --> 02:53.914
bird-watching? That's easy.

02:54.015 --> 02:56.019
Oh, uh, you know, I dabbled

02:56.152 --> 02:58.156
in bird-watching once.
Well, by dabbled, I mean

02:58.223 --> 03:00.360
I bought a bird guide
and put it up on the shelf

03:00.427 --> 03:01.830
and looked up at it sometimes.

03:01.897 --> 03:03.601
That's great because
the Thundergirl Handbook says

03:03.734 --> 03:05.337
we'll need a bird guide.
And also binoculars.

03:05.437 --> 03:07.374
We used to have binoculars.
What happened to those?

03:07.441 --> 03:09.478
They're in my room.
I use them to spy on my feet

03:09.579 --> 03:11.482
while I lie in bed.
Where's my badge?

03:11.617 --> 03:13.621
Great. I'll go to the park
tomorrow to see some birds.

03:13.687 --> 03:15.591
Dad, bird-man?
You're coming with.

03:15.658 --> 03:16.760
Oh, uh, okay.

03:16.827 --> 03:19.031
I mean, I should stay at
the restaurant, but...

03:19.065 --> 03:20.635
bird-watching does
sound relaxing.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.271
Uh, you know, I've been
a little stressed lately.

03:22.371 --> 03:24.341
You mean, all the time
every day, all day long?

03:24.442 --> 03:26.446
-And when you sleep.
-Yeah, pretty much.
-TINA: Great.

03:26.513 --> 03:28.349
I'm gonna get my Lightning Sash
and have a good future

03:28.450 --> 03:29.786
and it's all gonna be fine.

03:29.853 --> 03:31.724
Oh, and Mom? Your fly is
somehow all the way down again.

03:31.790 --> 03:33.694
Oh, wow. Maybe this is
just how it is now

03:33.761 --> 03:35.430
and I'm gonna have
to buy cuter underwear.

03:35.497 --> 03:37.267
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>All right, Dad.</i>

03:37.367 --> 03:39.171
I'm looking at the time
and it's bird o'clock.

03:39.238 --> 03:40.908
Hey, Bob, aren't you kind of
afraid of birds?

03:40.975 --> 03:43.881
I was. But I realized they
aren't trying to kill me,

03:43.981 --> 03:45.383
and now I'm fine with them.

03:45.484 --> 03:46.854
If they don't get
too close to me.

03:46.987 --> 03:48.156
Like me with salads.

03:48.256 --> 03:50.661
Not to be rude, but did you hear
when I said it was bird o'clock?

03:50.762 --> 03:52.832
It's almost bird-thirty now,
so...

03:52.899 --> 03:54.603
Tina, easy. But okay, we can go.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.607
Bye! I'll be here
if you need me.

03:56.673 --> 03:59.211
Uh... I figured.
Linda, thanks for covering.

03:59.278 --> 04:01.817
You're welcome.
Say "hi" to the birds for me.

04:01.884 --> 04:03.420
Or flip 'em the bird. Ha!

04:03.521 --> 04:04.856
-Uh, okay.
-That'd be funny

04:04.956 --> 04:06.426
'cause they're also birds.

04:07.161 --> 04:08.664
So, how does this work exactly?

04:08.764 --> 04:10.701
I have to observe 15
different types of wild birds,

04:10.768 --> 04:12.605
identify them by name,
and write them down.

04:12.672 --> 04:14.475
Well, good thing
we have my bird book.

04:14.543 --> 04:17.080
For the identifying part.
Really glad I bought this...

04:17.181 --> 04:18.784
-(book creaks)
-so long ago.

04:18.918 --> 04:20.287
Did it make a noise
when you opened it?

04:20.387 --> 04:22.692
Yeah. Because it's
never been opened.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.161
Probably thought
it never would be.

04:24.228 --> 04:25.531
I bet some new birds
have come out

04:25.598 --> 04:27.267
since that was published.
(gasps) Look!

04:27.334 --> 04:29.038
-BOB: Oh, yeah.
-TINA: A black hopper bird.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.808
You-you mean... a crow?

04:30.875 --> 04:33.179
-Right. A crow. Sorry, I choked.
-That-That's okay.

04:33.246 --> 04:36.419
One bird type down.
14 types to go.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.254
"Crow."

04:37.354 --> 04:39.091
Uh... Yep, that was a crow.

04:39.158 --> 04:41.062
"American crow," technically.

04:41.129 --> 04:43.233
"Widespread. Numerous in cities.

04:43.299 --> 04:44.301
Of the genus Corvus..."

Where's all the friggin' birds?

04:59.666 --> 05:01.002
I mean, we saw Bruce the goose,

05:01.135 --> 05:02.337
but then like
ten different crows.

05:02.404 --> 05:03.941
Or maybe the same crow
ten different times?

Didn't we also see a pigeon?

Yeah. Plus that
little brown bird.

05:12.424 --> 05:13.727
What did we think that was?

05:13.861 --> 05:14.896
Sparrow, maybe?

05:14.963 --> 05:16.399
It was hard to get a clear ID.

05:16.465 --> 05:17.702
(groans) That's another thing:

05:17.802 --> 05:19.338
why do they have to
fly around so much?

05:19.405 --> 05:21.275
We need like 11 more species!

05:21.342 --> 05:22.512
Oh, look, a ranger.

05:22.579 --> 05:23.581
Is that a type of bird? Where?

05:23.647 --> 05:25.283
No, I-I mean, a park ranger.

05:25.350 --> 05:26.419
Who works here.

05:26.485 --> 05:28.089
TINA:
Oh. It's Ranger Matthew Dainko.

05:28.189 --> 05:30.695
Maybe he can point us to where
the cool bird hangouts are.

05:30.728 --> 05:32.665
He fricking better!
Sorry. I'll calm down.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.703
Uh, excuse me? Ranger Dainko?

05:34.769 --> 05:35.671
Can I help you?

05:35.771 --> 05:37.575
Maybe.
Um, I'm here working toward

05:37.675 --> 05:39.011
my Thundergirls Lightning Sash.

05:39.111 --> 05:41.282
Are you trying to earn
your trash clean-up badge?

05:41.349 --> 05:42.685
Oh, no. Sorry.

05:42.752 --> 05:44.188
Ah. Then I'll, uh... carry on.

05:44.221 --> 05:46.693
But-but actually I'm trying
to earn my birding badge?

05:46.827 --> 05:49.533
Oh! Well,
you came to the right place.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.337
It's like Grand Central Station
for birds around here,

05:52.437 --> 05:54.375
with all the species
passing through

05:54.441 --> 05:55.745
on their migration routes.

05:55.811 --> 05:57.682
I've seen common starlings,
house finches,

05:57.749 --> 05:59.953
cedar waxwings--
that's my spark bird.

06:00.053 --> 06:01.289
Your what?

06:01.355 --> 06:02.457
Spark bird,

06:02.559 --> 06:04.094
the bird that got me
interested in birding.

06:04.161 --> 06:06.667
<i>A waxwing showed up outside</i>
<i>the ranger station</i>

06:06.767 --> 06:07.936
<i>one day when I was at a...</i>

06:08.002 --> 06:10.073
<i>vulnerable place</i>
<i>in my personal life.</i>

06:10.173 --> 06:11.944
-What was wrong?
-Maybe we shouldn't
get into it.

06:12.044 --> 06:13.346
No, no, no, no, no, it's okay.

06:13.413 --> 06:15.150
I had just gotten
the worst haircut of my life.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.789
-Oh.
-I mean, this was <i>here.</i>

06:17.889 --> 06:19.358
Huh. That sounds awful.

06:19.425 --> 06:21.295
I stared at that waxwing
for half an hour.

06:21.362 --> 06:23.834
<i>Just feeling my feelings,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

06:23.934 --> 06:25.370
<i>(crying): Uh-oh.</i>

06:25.437 --> 06:26.907
Uh, are you okay?

06:27.007 --> 06:29.613
Eh, let's not talk about
waxwings. Or bad haircuts.

06:29.679 --> 06:32.251
Hey, say you wanted
to see a lot of different birds

06:32.317 --> 06:33.787
in a really, really short time.

06:33.887 --> 06:35.390
Really short time.
What would you do?

06:35.490 --> 06:38.029
Well, birding's
about being present.

06:38.129 --> 06:39.799
You know, slowing down.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.335
-Great.
-Some people come out here

06:41.402 --> 06:43.273
and just want it to happen fast,
so they pull out

06:43.339 --> 06:45.143
all sorts of dirty
little tricks.

06:45.210 --> 06:46.245
Go on...

06:46.345 --> 06:47.347
Well, you know,

06:47.447 --> 06:49.018
some people use
recorded bird calls.

06:49.084 --> 06:50.020
That's frowned upon.

06:50.086 --> 06:51.222
Oh, yeah. That's terrible.

06:51.289 --> 06:52.859
And then there's
the punks that bait.

06:52.926 --> 06:55.063
-They "bait"?
-Yeah, they put out
a bunch of food,

06:55.130 --> 06:56.533
then watch the birds roll in.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.936
It's not sporting.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.574
And as everyone knows,
you don't feed wild animals.

07:00.641 --> 07:02.512
That's a big old no-no.

07:02.545 --> 07:03.847
Yeah, sure, totally. (chuckles)

07:03.948 --> 07:05.685
I see anyone doing that
in this park,

07:05.785 --> 07:07.287
I'm slapping them with a fine.

07:07.387 --> 07:08.657
Good to know, good to know,
good to know.

07:08.757 --> 07:10.293
Yeah. Thank you, Ranger Dainko.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.632
Uh, could you recommend
any specific spots

07:12.699 --> 07:14.468
that are good for bird-watching?

07:14.536 --> 07:17.341
'Cause where we've been
has been... not that.

07:17.407 --> 07:19.278
Well, you could
always try the meadow.

07:19.378 --> 07:21.182
You just follow that path,
go to the right,

07:21.248 --> 07:22.619
and then stay along
the wood line.

07:22.685 --> 07:24.254
-Anyway, happy birding.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

07:24.355 --> 07:26.560
Okay, so now we know
what not to do.

07:26.660 --> 07:29.298
Uh-huh. Or do we know
what not not to do?

07:29.398 --> 07:30.501
Mm. Mm-mm.

07:30.601 --> 07:32.404
Would you say this is your
best bread for baiting birds?

07:32.471 --> 07:34.943
-What?
-We'll take it.
-Oh, my God.

07:38.951 --> 07:40.420
Tina, the ranger said
you shouldn't bait them.

07:40.487 --> 07:41.823
So, let's not do that

07:41.923 --> 07:44.663
and just use the bread for...
sandwiches?

07:44.729 --> 07:46.198
He'll never catch us, okay?

07:46.265 --> 07:47.535
We can say we're
having a picnic.

07:47.602 --> 07:48.771
A bread picnic.

07:48.871 --> 07:50.206
Also, how's your phone
reception here?

07:50.273 --> 07:52.010
Want to pull up some
bird calls from the Internet?

07:52.077 --> 07:53.313
Maybe a fun playlist?

07:53.379 --> 07:54.516
Tina, I really don't
want us to get caught

07:54.582 --> 07:55.818
and then have to pay a fine.

07:55.885 --> 07:57.822
Dad, I can either
get my Lightning Sash

07:57.889 --> 07:59.726
and do well in life
or not get it, and-and...

07:59.793 --> 08:01.697
never get into a good college
and never achieve my dreams!

08:01.763 --> 08:05.738
Okay, okay. I guess it will
just be feeding birds.

08:05.838 --> 08:07.174
People do that
all the time, right?

08:07.240 --> 08:09.612
Sure. And people also
just casually play bird calls

08:09.713 --> 08:10.948
from their phone.

08:11.015 --> 08:13.019
So that birds can hear
how great they sound.

08:13.086 --> 08:14.321
Could you cue 'em up?

08:14.421 --> 08:15.423
Uh... yep.

08:15.490 --> 08:17.361
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>I'm just gonna say it...</i>

08:17.427 --> 08:18.731
this day could be more fun.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.133
Shall I do a little dance?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.304
You've already done
so many of those today.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.709
What if you
dare me to do something?

08:24.776 --> 08:26.345
Like, dare you to dream?

08:26.445 --> 08:29.485
No. What if you dare me to...
put this napkin

08:29.519 --> 08:31.222
on Teddy's shoulder
without him noticing?

08:31.288 --> 08:33.292
Ah, the old napkin shoulder.
Classic.

08:33.393 --> 08:36.365
Okay, you dared me to do it,
I'm doing it. I feel so alive.

08:36.399 --> 08:39.138
Teddy, old buddy, old pal.
How's tricks?

08:39.238 --> 08:40.908
Oh, hey, Louise. I'm doing good.

08:40.975 --> 08:42.477
A little anxious.
Might be all the coffee.

08:42.578 --> 08:43.914
I think I might need
some more coffee

08:44.014 --> 08:45.450
just to kind of push past it,
you know?

08:45.518 --> 08:47.287
Get to that place where
nothing matters anymore.

08:47.354 --> 08:49.224
Great.
Well, keep up the good work.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.360
More coffee, Teddy?

08:50.460 --> 08:52.698
You betcha, yes, please.
Toot-toot!

08:52.799 --> 08:54.502
Or decaf, we have decaf...

08:54.569 --> 08:55.538
I'd rather be dead!

08:55.638 --> 08:56.773
Okay, okay.

08:56.807 --> 08:58.076
I might not fill up
the whole cup.

08:58.176 --> 08:59.946
Hey, how come you
got a napkin on your shoulder?

09:00.013 --> 09:02.184
Huh? Oh. Did I put
that there this morning?

09:02.284 --> 09:03.554
Do I have one there a lot?

09:03.620 --> 09:04.622
-(chuckles)
-Hmm.

09:04.656 --> 09:05.925
Now it's my turn to dare you.

09:06.058 --> 09:08.429
Now dare's an idea!
Eh? Nailed it.

09:08.530 --> 09:09.766
(bird calls playing over phone)

09:09.866 --> 09:10.868
Little louder
with the bird calls?

09:10.968 --> 09:12.003
Let's hear those "cheep-cheeps"

09:12.137 --> 09:13.005
in the cheap seats, huh?

09:13.139 --> 09:13.907
What bird call is that?

09:13.974 --> 09:15.878
"Exotic Birds of the Amazon."

09:15.945 --> 09:19.151
I-I think the one video ended
and this played automatically.

09:19.251 --> 09:20.386
Maybe exotic is good?

09:20.453 --> 09:22.324
Birds will think
they're on vacation?

09:22.390 --> 09:24.161
Um, what are you doing
with the crumbs?

09:24.228 --> 09:26.198
Making a smiley face.
If you were a bird,

09:26.265 --> 09:28.236
would you fly past a smiley face
made of bread crumbs?

09:28.336 --> 09:30.006
-Probably not?
-Okay then.

09:30.073 --> 09:32.010
How are you at
emoji silly tongues?

09:32.077 --> 09:33.179
I mean... not great.

09:33.246 --> 09:34.649
Just do what you can.

09:34.716 --> 09:36.185
Kids? Order's up!

09:36.252 --> 09:37.220
-Little help?
-Coming!

09:37.287 --> 09:38.791
You're on. Make it good.

09:38.857 --> 09:40.293
I'm always on, honey!

09:40.427 --> 09:42.197
Your burger, madam.
Young sir...

09:42.264 --> 09:43.567
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.038
And, uh... Do you have a diaper
you could spare?

09:46.138 --> 09:47.073
Excuse me?

09:47.140 --> 09:48.944
I said, "Do you have
a spare diaper?"

09:49.077 --> 09:51.415
For my cute little bottom
that needs to go poo-poo.

09:51.482 --> 09:53.319
-There I did it, goodbye!
-"Poo-poo."

09:53.419 --> 09:55.223
-I'm a genius.
-(Linda clears throat)

09:55.323 --> 09:57.628
Gene. Louise. In here, now.

09:57.695 --> 09:59.331
-Crap.
-Don't feel bad.

09:59.398 --> 10:00.601
Potty training is hard.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.703
She's right.

10:01.837 --> 10:03.406
I know what you kids are doing.

10:03.507 --> 10:05.043
-It was all Gene's idea.
-What?

10:05.110 --> 10:06.178
You're doing dares.

10:06.245 --> 10:07.414
I know, it's awful.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.084
That's what I kept
trying to tell Gene.

10:09.184 --> 10:10.386
Shush. What I want to know

10:10.453 --> 10:11.890
is why didn't you
ask me to play?

10:11.957 --> 10:12.925
Uh... huh?

10:12.959 --> 10:14.696
Wait, you want us to dare you?

10:14.762 --> 10:17.167
Yeah! I do dares. I love dares.

10:17.267 --> 10:18.770
I never said no to one. Ever.

10:18.837 --> 10:19.973
Is that a good thing?

10:20.039 --> 10:22.010
Of course it is.
When I was growing up,

10:22.110 --> 10:24.114
kids in the neighborhood
called me "the Dare-y Queen."

10:24.181 --> 10:25.383
-Huh.
-Mm.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.454
Well, I called myself that a lot
and it kind of caught on.

10:27.522 --> 10:29.859
But hey, this isn't the
old neighborhood. We're at work.

10:29.926 --> 10:31.195
So, no bothering the customers

10:31.295 --> 10:32.632
and nothing that makes
a big mess, capisce?

10:32.732 --> 10:33.967
We can work with that.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.036
All right, then.

10:35.136 --> 10:36.472
Go dream up a good dare
for your mother.

10:36.540 --> 10:37.340
Make it fun.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.178
I dare you to hug me, woman!

10:39.244 --> 10:40.881
Aw, I'll take that dare.

10:40.948 --> 10:43.754
But seriously. Give me
a real dare. Better than that.

10:44.989 --> 10:46.292
-It's working.
-Okay, um,

10:46.325 --> 10:48.095
those are mourning doves.

10:48.196 --> 10:49.097
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

10:49.164 --> 10:51.803
So, yeah. Wow.
Should we just walk away

10:51.903 --> 10:54.776
from this bird-baiting area and,
you know, try not to do things

10:54.876 --> 10:56.145
that could get us fined?

10:56.212 --> 10:57.682
-But this is going well, Dad.
-(bird calling)

10:57.782 --> 10:59.351
And we still have
eight bird types left to go.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.654
-Huh.
-What?

11:00.721 --> 11:01.756
You see that up there?

11:01.823 --> 11:02.925
There's sort of a large bird.

11:03.025 --> 11:04.596
TINA:
Yeah, that's a big boy. Or girl.

11:04.662 --> 11:06.298
I can't see its, um...
N-Never mind.

11:06.398 --> 11:07.502
Can you see its beak?

11:07.568 --> 11:09.004
Is it more pecky,
or rip apart-y?

11:09.137 --> 11:11.810
I think it's hooked?
So... rip apart-y?

11:11.877 --> 11:13.312
(sighs) I'm not sure,

11:13.379 --> 11:14.682
but I think that's a hawk.

11:14.749 --> 11:16.051
Possibly a broad-winged hawk.

11:16.151 --> 11:18.189
TINA:
Okay. And it's circling why?

11:18.256 --> 11:19.324
Is it doing laps?

11:19.391 --> 11:20.493
Is this a fitness thing?

11:20.561 --> 11:22.999
I think it's circling because

11:23.065 --> 11:25.003
we might've made it
easy for it to see

11:25.069 --> 11:26.540
where its next meal is
coming from.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.342
-Oh, no. You mean the doves?
-Yup.

11:28.409 --> 11:29.378
Birds eat other birds?!

11:29.478 --> 11:30.748
I mean, I guess I knew that

11:30.814 --> 11:32.183
but it seems crazy to me now!

11:32.250 --> 11:33.954
They should be friends,
they have so much in common!

11:34.021 --> 11:36.726
Yeah. But eating each other is
definitely something they do.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.164
No! We can't let this happen!
Get away, birds!

11:39.231 --> 11:41.001
Fly away from the
smiley face silly tongues!

11:41.068 --> 11:42.437
-It's a trap!
-Uh, Tina.

11:42.538 --> 11:43.774
Ranger Matthew Dainko!

11:43.874 --> 11:45.243
Okay, okay. Uh...

11:45.343 --> 11:47.447
I'll just pick up all
the crumbs. There's one.

11:47.548 --> 11:48.917
-There's one!
-Tina, we should go.

11:48.984 --> 11:50.888
Just a couple more crumbs.
There's one. Oh, so many crumbs.

11:50.955 --> 11:52.792
-Tina!
-Okay, coming!

11:53.660 --> 11:54.862
-Oh, God!
-Uh, yup.

11:54.929 --> 11:56.566
A broad-winged hawk.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.236
Wow, look at this
great illustration.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.406
-Huh, huh.
-Never mind.
-(hawk screeches)

12:04.782 --> 12:05.985
(Tina hyperventilating)

12:06.085 --> 12:08.155
Do you think the dove's
gonna be okay?

12:08.222 --> 12:09.391
Yeah. Yeah.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.195
Uh, maybe don't look, though.

12:11.262 --> 12:13.232
Also, Ranger Dainko's
walking this way, so, uh...

12:13.299 --> 12:15.470
-Tina, we've got to go.
-What have I done?!

12:15.537 --> 12:17.007
-(hyperventilating)
-Tina, please.

12:17.073 --> 12:19.979
Um, can you make that noise
a little quieter?

12:20.079 --> 12:21.683
-(panting quietly)
-Thank you.

12:21.750 --> 12:22.652
Thank you, that's better.

12:22.718 --> 12:24.522
What the heck happened here?
Bread crumbs?!

12:24.589 --> 12:25.724
-(bird call plays)
-Oh, no.

12:25.791 --> 12:27.460
The bird call video
came back on!

12:27.561 --> 12:28.730
How do I mute this thing?!

12:28.764 --> 12:29.732
Toucans?

12:29.766 --> 12:30.768
Please stop, phone.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.170
Why are you doing this?

12:32.304 --> 12:34.141
You! You... bad birders!

12:34.241 --> 12:35.978
-Stay right there!
-Okay, run!

12:36.111 --> 12:38.717
Excuse me, can you point me to
the nearest water fountain?

12:38.817 --> 12:40.119
I'm very parched.

12:40.186 --> 12:42.324
(groans) It's-it's
over there by the dog run.

12:42.390 --> 12:43.727
The dog run dog run,

12:43.827 --> 12:45.664
or the field where
people let their dogs run?

12:45.731 --> 12:47.467
(yells)
I don't have time for this!

12:47.535 --> 12:48.670
-Excuse me!
-Sorry.

12:48.737 --> 12:52.444
-Dog run dog run!
-Thank you.

12:52.511 --> 12:55.483
Ow! Ow, ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

12:55.584 --> 12:57.253
Yeah, baby! I did the dare!

12:57.354 --> 12:59.091
Hot plates, straight out
of the dishwasher.

12:59.157 --> 13:00.928
-Impressive.
-I often drop them

13:00.995 --> 13:02.163
even when they're not hot.

13:02.263 --> 13:03.867
Good dare, good dare.
Way better than

13:03.934 --> 13:05.838
the "napkin on the shoulder"
thing, which,

13:05.871 --> 13:07.273
uh, sorry-- little lowbrow.

13:07.340 --> 13:09.812
Wait, there's another one
on there! Dang it!

13:09.879 --> 13:11.048
All right, next dare.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.551
Give it to me.
Dare-y Queen's ready!

13:12.652 --> 13:14.689
Okay, I think
I might have something.

13:14.756 --> 13:16.325
-Ooh, tell me.
-(whispering)

13:16.392 --> 13:18.462
-Interesting.
-What is it? What is it?

13:18.530 --> 13:19.899
I can tell it's gonna be good.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.337
Well, first you should know
it involves a customer.

13:22.437 --> 13:24.308
What? That's one
of the rules, Louise.

13:24.408 --> 13:27.047
But all the best dares
are about humiliating yourself.

13:27.113 --> 13:28.750
You can't just
take that off the table.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.320
Yeah, it's like
Peter Jackson saying,

13:30.420 --> 13:32.925
"I'll make a movie but
absolutely no hobbits!"

13:32.992 --> 13:35.063
Plus, you said you
never turn down a dare.

13:35.096 --> 13:36.298
You did say that, Linda.

13:36.365 --> 13:37.868
Come on, Dare-y Queen.

13:37.935 --> 13:41.008
No. I'm not doing it.
It's irresponsible.

13:41.075 --> 13:42.578
And you know what?
I'm fine with it.

13:42.678 --> 13:43.980
I'm fine with
not doing the dare.

13:44.047 --> 13:45.416
Just go bus that table.

13:45.483 --> 13:47.555
I'm gonna go in the kitchen.
I'm fine with this.

13:47.655 --> 13:48.924
Wow. What happened
to you, Linda?

13:49.024 --> 13:50.928
-You used to be cool.
-I still respect you, Mom.

13:50.994 --> 13:52.932
Ah, whatever.

13:55.303 --> 13:57.440
-Did we lose him?
-(Tina groans)

13:57.541 --> 13:58.977
Oh. Look over there, Tina.

13:59.077 --> 14:00.413
It's a blue jay. See it?

14:00.514 --> 14:01.916
TINA (sniffles):
Yeah.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.021
Uh, maybe you want to
put it down in your book?

14:04.087 --> 14:08.897
One blue jay... Not ripped apart
by hawk because of me.

14:08.964 --> 14:10.199
(sighs) Okay.

14:10.233 --> 14:12.905
And now let's watch
for more birds as we

14:12.972 --> 14:14.141
get out of here very quickly.

14:14.207 --> 14:15.376
Hopefully the ranger gave up

14:15.443 --> 14:16.746
-looking for us.
-Okay.

14:16.846 --> 14:18.950
On three, we get up
and run out of the park

14:19.017 --> 14:20.453
or I might walk fast.

14:20.554 --> 14:22.223
I'm not sure what I'm up for.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.929
Ready? One, two, three.
(grunting)

14:24.962 --> 14:26.733
This is Ranger Matthew Dainko!

14:26.800 --> 14:27.668
(Bob yells)

14:27.768 --> 14:30.607
Bad birding people,
bird-killing birder-ers,

14:30.708 --> 14:31.943
if you can hear this,

14:32.010 --> 14:34.247
you are wanted for questioning,

14:34.314 --> 14:36.920
-and definite fining!
-BOB: Oh, God.

14:36.986 --> 14:39.024
He's gonna find us.
Then he's gonna fine us.

14:39.124 --> 14:40.894
The old find-and-fine.

14:40.961 --> 14:42.832
What if we hide? In there?

14:43.499 --> 14:46.338
Okay, we're here now.
And for a bathroom in the park,

14:46.405 --> 14:48.844
there isn't too much horrible
stuff I can't look at.

14:48.977 --> 14:51.448
Except in the toilet,
and all around it.

14:51.549 --> 14:52.585
And the walls.

14:52.651 --> 14:53.954
Yeah, the walls are bad.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.691
DAINKO: I will cover
every inch of this park

14:55.791 --> 14:57.293
until I find you monsters!

14:57.393 --> 14:59.799
This is all my fault.
I thought this was gonna be

14:59.899 --> 15:01.503
the first step
toward a successful life.

15:01.603 --> 15:02.772
But I lost it, man.

15:02.872 --> 15:04.474
I'm a dove killer
hiding out in a toilet.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.679
How's that look on
a college application?

15:06.746 --> 15:08.650
Uh, Tina, don't feel too bad.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.486
I-I bet the dove died happy?

15:10.554 --> 15:12.658
Eating really good bread.
That's how I want go, Tina.

15:12.758 --> 15:15.764
And I think, yeah, I'm pretty
sure he was really old.

15:15.798 --> 15:17.835
And maybe even
had a terminal illness?

15:17.902 --> 15:18.870
(groans)

15:18.970 --> 15:21.008
All right,
I'll-I'll stop talking.

15:21.141 --> 15:22.845
DAINKO: Can you still
hear me, bad birders?

15:22.912 --> 15:24.549
Are you out there
somewhere tossing

15:24.649 --> 15:26.886
bread around like
it's the devil's confetti?!

15:27.020 --> 15:29.391
I'm gonna peek real quick
to see where he is.

15:29.491 --> 15:31.128
And he's very close.

15:31.195 --> 15:32.631
Uh, hey, there's a crow.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.201
Oh, no, do you think he heard

15:34.267 --> 15:35.537
what happened and
now he wants revenge?

15:35.637 --> 15:37.240
It looks like he's just
messing with a twig.

15:37.307 --> 15:38.710
TINA: Is he gonna turn it
into a weapon?

15:38.810 --> 15:40.346
Is he gonna shiv us
in the bathroom?!

15:40.446 --> 15:41.381
I don't think so.

15:41.448 --> 15:43.052
Oh, God, he just
looked at me, though.

15:43.119 --> 15:44.321
-Don't make eye contact.
-Right.

15:44.454 --> 15:45.791
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>I just came to drop off</i>

15:45.858 --> 15:47.595
an order.
And also I wanted to ask,

15:47.695 --> 15:50.433
how does it feel to be
a shell of your former self,

15:50.500 --> 15:51.669
Dare-y Queen?

15:51.736 --> 15:53.405
She used to be the Dare-y Queen.

15:53.472 --> 15:55.978
-(scoffs)
-But that was a long time ago.

15:56.044 --> 15:57.347
Isn't that right, Linda?

15:57.447 --> 15:58.884
(grumbles)

15:58.950 --> 15:59.785
Hmm.

15:59.852 --> 16:02.390
I wonder how she'd
feel if we double...

16:02.457 --> 16:03.593
-(gasps)
-dog...

16:03.693 --> 16:04.896
Don't you do it, Louise!

16:04.962 --> 16:05.898
...dared her.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.133
No!

16:07.233 --> 16:08.703
Double dog deal with it, Mama!

16:08.770 --> 16:09.972
Oh, okay, fine. I'll do it!

16:10.072 --> 16:11.943
Come back here,
tell me what it is.

16:12.010 --> 16:12.878
Yay, Linda!

16:12.945 --> 16:16.084
God, I love peer pressure.
Always works.

16:17.086 --> 16:19.291
Okay, I don't see him
and I don't hear him.

16:19.357 --> 16:21.094
Maybe we should make
a run for it?

16:21.161 --> 16:22.598
-Oh, wow.
-What? Do you see him?

16:22.665 --> 16:23.600
No, the crow.

16:23.667 --> 16:24.836
I thought it was playing

16:24.936 --> 16:26.038
with a twig,
but it was bending it.

16:26.071 --> 16:27.473
O-Okay. The ranger thing

16:27.541 --> 16:29.477
feels a little more pressing,
but great.

16:29.545 --> 16:31.248
TINA: Now it's poking
the stick into a log.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.720
-Like it's using it.
-BOB: Oh, yeah.

16:33.787 --> 16:35.591
I-I think that's a crow thing.

16:35.691 --> 16:37.093
They-they make tools, maybe?

16:37.160 --> 16:39.264
I mean, mostly they
dig in dumpsters, but...

16:39.364 --> 16:40.767
It's really getting in there.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.237
Maybe it's looking for bugs?

16:42.303 --> 16:43.640
Or treasure? Probably bugs.

16:43.707 --> 16:44.909
-Found you!
-BOTH: Ah!

16:44.976 --> 16:46.144
Geez, did you have
to use the megaphone?

16:46.245 --> 16:47.615
-Yes!
-BOTH: Ah!

16:51.823 --> 16:53.192
Come out, you two. Come on out.

16:53.259 --> 16:54.996
I knew I should've
checked the bathroom earlier,

16:55.096 --> 16:56.633
but I thought, "They wouldn't
hide in the bathroom."

16:56.733 --> 16:59.237
Not that our bathrooms
aren't reasonably sanitary

16:59.337 --> 17:01.174
but come on,
it's a park bathroom.

17:01.241 --> 17:02.377
I'm so sorry, Ranger Dainko.

17:02.443 --> 17:04.749
Yeah.
Th-This is really my fault.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.118
I mean, I'm gonna say that.

17:06.218 --> 17:07.320
It's not really his fault.

17:07.387 --> 17:09.491
-Oh! The crow's back.
-What? Oh.

17:09.559 --> 17:11.863
We've been watching him
while we've been in this

17:11.930 --> 17:13.232
reasonably sanitary bathroom.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.869
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, he bent a twig

17:14.936 --> 17:16.673
and he's been poking
into that log for,

17:16.739 --> 17:17.975
-like, a while now.
-Huh.

17:18.075 --> 17:19.377
I've heard about it,
but I've never

17:19.444 --> 17:21.048
actually seen them
use tools before.

17:21.114 --> 17:23.118
That is truly--
Oh, I'm-I'm talking too loud.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.622
Do you mind if I...?

17:24.689 --> 17:26.391
Uh... Okay. Yeah.

17:26.458 --> 17:27.628
DAINKO:
Geez. Look at that.

17:27.661 --> 17:28.730
Crows are really smart, huh?

17:28.830 --> 17:30.199
Yeah, we should
stop eating them.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.936
Kidding.
That was not a good joke

17:32.036 --> 17:32.938
around bird lovers.

17:33.005 --> 17:35.877
So about those bread crumbs
and the dove.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.514
I'm so sorry
about the bread crumbs,

17:37.581 --> 17:39.484
and the bird calls, and the poor
innocent little dove

17:39.552 --> 17:41.421
who I'm praying is
at least in bird heaven.

17:41.522 --> 17:42.992
Which must be
really high up there.

17:43.058 --> 17:44.662
It would have to be
or birds would always be

17:44.795 --> 17:46.098
flying into it by accident?

17:46.164 --> 17:48.469
Anyway, I just-- I wanted
my Lightning Sash so much.

17:48.603 --> 17:51.008
Oh, Tina.
I was in the Nature Boys.

17:51.108 --> 17:53.012
For us it was
the Order of the Grizzly.

17:53.112 --> 17:54.882
A lot of the other fellas
were hustling for that

17:54.949 --> 17:56.719
Grizzly Sash and
I always felt bad for them

17:56.753 --> 17:59.391
'cause they never just
stopped and smelled the roses.

17:59.457 --> 18:01.395
Rose-smelling
was a badge back then.

18:01.461 --> 18:03.232
Really? Huh.
Seems like an easy one.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.204
I mean, look at us,
right now, just crouching here

18:06.305 --> 18:08.208
enjoying this majestic crow.

18:08.309 --> 18:09.444
He doesn't give up, does he?

18:09.477 --> 18:11.214
-I really like that crow.
-Oh, my God.

18:11.281 --> 18:12.618
Is it your spark bird?

18:12.685 --> 18:14.722
Oh. Yeah. I guess it is.

18:14.855 --> 18:17.761
Oh, I'm witnessing someone
find their spark bird.

18:17.828 --> 18:20.199
(cries) This is gonna get
emotional for me.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.871
Uh, okay. Are-are you--
Are you all right?

18:22.938 --> 18:24.274
Do you want some toilet paper?

18:24.341 --> 18:27.480
Oh, uh, never mind,
the whole roll is wet somehow.

18:27.615 --> 18:30.353
I mean, I can probably
guess how it-it got wet.

18:30.453 --> 18:31.823
I'll-I'll be fine. Hey...

18:31.856 --> 18:34.060
let's forget about the whole
"bread crumbs, dead dove,

18:34.160 --> 18:36.198
chasing you around the park"
thing, okay?

18:36.298 --> 18:38.837
We're all birders here.

18:38.903 --> 18:39.905
-Whoa.
-He did it.

18:39.972 --> 18:41.843
A millipede! What a rush, huh?

18:41.909 --> 18:44.347
You guys, uh, want to
watch a little longer or...

18:44.414 --> 18:45.851
Oh, oh. It flew away.

18:45.951 --> 18:46.719
Aw.

18:46.819 --> 18:48.823
Should we, uh,
get out of the bathroom?

18:48.923 --> 18:50.026
Yeah, yeah, let's get out.

18:50.092 --> 18:52.463
Uh, I actually
have to pee, so...

18:52.497 --> 18:54.902
Never mind, I'll hold it.
No offense.

18:55.637 --> 18:57.473
Uh, excuse me?
We're ready to order.

18:57.541 --> 18:59.612
Your server will be
with you in a moment.

18:59.679 --> 19:01.281
LINDA:
Here I come.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.052
-Uh...
-LINDA: Ow.

19:03.118 --> 19:04.522
Okay, uh...

19:04.655 --> 19:06.659
Sorry, I'm a little
turned around today.

19:06.726 --> 19:07.928
What can I get you?

19:07.995 --> 19:10.199
Um, I would like a
Burger of the Day?

19:10.266 --> 19:11.569
Ooh, good choice.

19:11.636 --> 19:12.905
And, uh... fries.

19:13.005 --> 19:14.842
Fries, yep, yep, of course.

19:14.909 --> 19:17.113
Loving this. Loving this.

19:17.180 --> 19:18.750
How about you, sir?
What'll you have?

19:18.817 --> 19:20.219
Um, a cheeseburger.

19:20.286 --> 19:21.956
You got it! Writing it down.

19:22.023 --> 19:25.296
Here I go. Cheese... burger.

19:25.363 --> 19:28.268
-Wow. Guess the Dare-y Queen's
alive and well.
-Ooh!

19:28.335 --> 19:30.507
Now I will bring your order
back into the kitchen.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.544
And cook it. Like this. Ow.

19:32.644 --> 19:33.980
LOUISE:
No, no, no, no, no. Mom,

19:34.114 --> 19:35.550
don't do that.
That seems dangerous.

19:35.650 --> 19:37.755
I'm doing it.
It's a double dog dare.

19:37.855 --> 19:39.024
I'm gettin' double dare points!

19:39.090 --> 19:40.292
Oh, dear Lord.

19:40.359 --> 19:41.428
LINDA:
Dare-y Queen! Oh, God!

19:41.529 --> 19:42.865
-Mom!
-LINDA: No, I'm fine!

19:42.998 --> 19:44.200
-(thudding)
-LINDA: Ow. Oh, God.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.704
-Ow!
-She's so brave.

19:45.771 --> 19:46.839
(bell jingles)

19:46.939 --> 19:50.146
Well, looky here,
if it isn't the bird nerds.

19:50.179 --> 19:52.116
Ha! She nailed you guys.

19:52.150 --> 19:52.951
Mm.

19:53.052 --> 19:54.120
So? How'd it go, Tina?

19:54.154 --> 19:55.156
You get your badge?

19:55.256 --> 19:56.592
I'm two birds away.
I might go back

19:56.692 --> 19:58.328
to the park
and finish up tomorrow.

19:58.462 --> 20:00.332
And then you're on your way to
getting your Lightning hoozit?

20:00.466 --> 20:02.303
Maybe. I think I'm just gonna

20:02.437 --> 20:03.907
earn badges at a normal speed.

20:03.973 --> 20:05.409
I might get more out of it.

20:05.476 --> 20:07.413
And I don't want to be a fortune
cookie company CEO anyway.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.650
And no doves have to die.

20:08.717 --> 20:10.787
-Say what now?
-Uh, I'll tell you later.

20:10.854 --> 20:12.958
Did you hear what it
sounds like when doves cry?

20:13.025 --> 20:14.962
Eh... Yeah. It's unsettling.

20:15.029 --> 20:17.200
-How was it here?
-Eh, fine.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.204
We sold some burgers,
ate some gross stuff,

20:19.270 --> 20:21.341
maybe scared a couple
customers a little bit.

20:21.374 --> 20:23.078
Um... What-what do you mean?

20:23.145 --> 20:24.849
Well, glad to have you back,
big guy.

20:24.915 --> 20:27.253
Why did you just put
a napkin on my shoulder?

20:27.320 --> 20:28.757
Ha! It was a dare.

20:28.823 --> 20:29.792
No, it wasn't.

20:29.892 --> 20:31.194
They dared me, Bob. I swear.

20:31.228 --> 20:32.731
We don't know
what he's talking about.

20:32.831 --> 20:33.833
What's a "dare"?

20:33.933 --> 20:35.202
No, you guys. Come on.

20:35.269 --> 20:36.606
