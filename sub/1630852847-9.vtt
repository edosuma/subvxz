00:15.432 --> 00:17.726
The world needs
to see your talent again.

00:17.767 --> 00:21.229
Let's talk about
the Neeman artistic fellowship.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.064
This is Judge Robertson.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.524
Heard a lot about you, Will.

00:24.566 --> 00:25.900
Hey, I'd rather
meet you out here

00:25.942 --> 00:27.569
at a fancy dinner party
than in a courtroom.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.779
And I can do it my way,
without you.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.285

and you owe me a kill fee.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.162
This special election
has gotten complicated

00:37.203 --> 00:38.580
since you jumped in.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.540
Our debate should decide
which one of us

00:40.582 --> 00:43.043
continues to stand
in the election.

00:43.084 --> 00:46.087
Loser bows out, throwing his
full support behind the winner.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.922
Hey, Mom.
Can we talk?

00:47.964 --> 00:49.299
About what, baby?

00:49.341 --> 00:50.717
About my dad.

00:50.759 --> 00:54.054
I need you to do me a favor.
Look into my pops?

00:54.095 --> 00:55.430
Maybe you should try
a different tact

00:55.472 --> 00:56.473
with Will's dad, huh?
- If you knew Lou,

00:56.514 --> 00:57.891

00:57.932 --> 01:00.101
He's not someone Will needs

Now, why'd you
really leave Philly?

01:02.062 --> 01:04.272
I came here from Philly...

01:08.068 --> 01:09.611

Ooh, okay, Ashley,
here's your chance.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.605
Well, I was saying
that the church needs

04:32.647 --> 04:35.025
to put more people
who identify as LGBTQ+

04:35.066 --> 04:37.152

That's a thoughtful
observation, Ashley.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.823
And a work-in-progress here,
but, uh,

04:41.865 --> 04:43.783
I'll keep it in mind, okay?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.660
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

You know--

04:59.090 --> 05:00.258
That question
just came to you

05:00.300 --> 05:01.968
for no reason?
- It just dropped down.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.346
I mean, I admit it would
aid in my campaign

05:04.387 --> 05:06.222

it wouldn't hurt to show that

05:06.264 --> 05:08.516

whenever there's an election.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.934

how to use eyeliner

07:34.621 --> 07:35.955
Hey, yo, Aunt Viv,

07:35.997 --> 07:37.374

07:37.415 --> 07:39.501
about how you used to sing
off-key at church.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.336
Is that true?
- No!

07:41.378 --> 07:43.505
Because, unlike Vy,
I can harmonize.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.299
Ah!

07:52.514 --> 07:56.726
The Bible warns us
not to have two masters.

07:58.269 --> 08:02.232
Because we cannot divide
our devotion and our ambitions

08:02.273 --> 08:05.985
any more than we can divide
our hearts and our souls.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.404

10:13.822 --> 10:16.533
Jess, could you play something
for the church choir, please?

10:25.375 --> 10:26.960
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.254
Is Carlton okay?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.505
There's not something wrong

10:30.547 --> 10:32.549
you're not telling me about,
right?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.760
No, why would you think
we'd hide anything from you?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.595
I don't know,
it just seems like you and Dad

10:37.637 --> 10:39.681
like to keep things from me
for my own good.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.017
Listen.
Your brother's fine.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.354
So what's up, then?

10:46.396 --> 10:49.524
Yeah, I was
just noticing that

10:49.566 --> 10:52.444
you've gone from promoting
climate change

10:52.485 --> 10:55.613
to championing LGBTQ causes,

10:55.655 --> 10:58.658
and I was just
checking in about that.

10:58.700 --> 10:59.868
Civil rights
and climate change

10:59.909 --> 11:01.786
are both very vital
social issues.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.954
I agree.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.748
And I haven't traded one
for the other.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.375
I'm just advocating
on multiple fronts.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.627
I get that--
in fact, I love it.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.546
I was just wondering
if there was a reason why

11:11.588 --> 11:13.923
gay rights has become
more important to you.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.300
Seriously?

11:15.342 --> 11:16.676
I mean, the real question is,

11:16.718 --> 11:18.595
why aren't the human rights
of any social group

11:18.636 --> 11:20.138
at the top
of everyone's concerns?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.390
Of course, I mean,
that's why your father

11:22.432 --> 11:24.809
and I donated
to marriage equality.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.227
Commendable,

11:26.269 --> 11:28.730
although those issues
have advanced beyond that.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.648
Listen,

11:30.690 --> 11:33.777
I just want you to know that
you can talk to me

11:33.818 --> 11:36.404

or other issues.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.157

- I know.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.771
He can really sing.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.856
I can't believe he just got
stage fright like that

12:11.898 --> 12:13.525
all of a sudden.

what the deal is.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.354
I don't know if
he wants to talk to me.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.864
Well, I haven't seen
what you've seen,

13:03.116 --> 13:05.410
Besides, you two are really
getting along now, right?

13:05.452 --> 13:08.038
Yeah, we are actually.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.331
Okay, I'll talk to him.

I honestly just want
to know how you're doing

13:55.418 --> 13:57.671
and what happened up there.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.675
I didn't eat
anything this morning,

14:01.716 --> 14:04.052
the church was hot as hell,
and I felt dizzy.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.054
And I didn't want
anyone to see me fall out.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.514
Happy?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.766
Okay...

14:09.808 --> 14:13.061
Don't give me "Okay."
What are you getting at, Will?

14:13.103 --> 14:16.272
Listen,
last time you got stage fright,

14:16.314 --> 14:17.982
you were supposed to do
that poem with Lisa,

14:18.024 --> 14:19.818
but instead, you were
doing coke in your closet.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.319
And today I could tell
you were nervous, so--

14:21.361 --> 14:22.737
I wasn't nervous.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.156
You don't know shit, Will.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.659
I suffer from anxiety.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.119
And the sad part is,
I have anxiety

14:29.160 --> 14:30.704
about telling people
I have anxiety,

14:30.745 --> 14:32.163
and so then
it just builds on itself,

14:32.205 --> 14:35.041
and it just keeps going,
and it gets louder and louder,

14:35.083 --> 14:36.543
and, you know,

14:36.584 --> 14:40.088
I use the drugs to--
to cope with it.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.058
You know, it's funny 'cause
I didn't even use them today.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.897
I probably should have.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.361
I knew I was gonna struggle.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.030
I saw all the red flags,

15:05.071 --> 15:08.742
but my dad was just
so excited to have me sing.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.369
I just want
to make my dad proud of me.

you deserve this fellowship.

22:03.782 --> 22:05.784
Well, my paintings aim

22:05.825 --> 22:10.163
to capture the beauty
and strength

22:10.205 --> 22:12.999
of ordinary Black folk
in portraiture.

22:13.041 --> 22:16.461
I don't typically pose
my subjects.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.297
Instead, I just try
to depict them as they are.

22:19.339 --> 22:22.550
My intention--
- We--we know all that.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.637
But what we would
like to know today is,

22:25.679 --> 22:27.972
why did you stop painting
for so long?

22:35.188 --> 22:37.273
You know,
I'm supposed to tell you

22:37.315 --> 22:40.735
that the demands of marriage
and motherhood

22:40.777 --> 22:43.738
swept the paintbrush
out of my hand.

22:43.780 --> 22:47.534
But the truth is...

22:47.575 --> 22:50.286
I just got tired
of all the battles

22:50.328 --> 22:52.997
I had to face being
a Black, female artist

22:53.039 --> 22:55.583
once the painting was done.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.003
Because painting
is the easy part.

22:58.044 --> 23:01.172
It's natural.
It's my gift from God.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.133
But once the paint dries,

23:03.174 --> 23:06.052
you have to explain
who you are,

23:06.094 --> 23:09.848
then you have to explain
your work to these men,

23:09.889 --> 23:12.225
and then you have to fight
to get into an exhibit,

23:12.267 --> 23:13.977
fight to be noticed,

23:14.019 --> 23:17.063
and I got tired of trying
to twist whatever I was doing

23:17.105 --> 23:20.734
to fit into whatever
was popular on the scene.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.569
And then
you have to fight even harder

23:22.610 --> 23:23.903
just to get your work
to be sold.

23:23.945 --> 23:25.405
It's just too much.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.948
Then what brought you back?

23:30.785 --> 23:34.414
My nephew,
he moved in with us.

23:34.456 --> 23:37.250
And he is just...

23:37.292 --> 23:40.587
so free and...

23:40.628 --> 23:43.089
unapologetically himself.

23:43.131 --> 23:46.926
Got this fire
to just take life head on,

23:46.968 --> 23:51.264
and I was like,
"I used to be like that."

23:51.306 --> 23:55.310
And I realized,
I can still be like that.

23:56.853 --> 24:01.441
That realization got me excited
to create again.

24:01.483 --> 24:05.236
And once I got started, I just
wanted to do it more and more,

24:05.278 --> 24:09.949
and so now, my perspective,
after all of these years,

24:09.991 --> 24:14.537
is that my work can resonate
out in the world

24:14.579 --> 24:18.375
without me having to define it
on anyone else's terms.

24:18.416 --> 24:22.420
So I just want to work
and I just want to shine and...

24:23.797 --> 24:26.007
I know you have
a lot to think about, so...

24:26.049 --> 24:28.968
Well, actually, we don't.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.305

before you came in today

Listen, it's like this.

38:51.831 --> 38:53.583
My husband is
in the middle of a campaign,

38:53.625 --> 38:55.126
running for district attorney,

38:55.168 --> 38:57.796
and I think he has
a real shot of winning.

38:57.837 --> 39:01.591
And then my nephew
just moved in with us,

39:01.633 --> 39:03.802
which has been an adjustment,
to say the least,

39:03.843 --> 39:06.596
then my son, who has had
anxiety issues in the past,

39:06.638 --> 39:08.556
seems like he's starting
to struggle with that again--

39:08.598 --> 39:10.558
oh, and then I have
a daughter walking around

39:10.600 --> 39:12.060
hiding secrets from me
because she thinks

39:12.102 --> 39:14.020
I can't handle it,

39:14.062 --> 39:15.980
who's sharin' all her business
on social media,

39:16.022 --> 39:17.941
so when I put
all that together,

instead of what I can do,
