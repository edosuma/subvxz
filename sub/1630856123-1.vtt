08:06.398 --> 08:09.358
When they called,
the police said you

08:09.401 --> 08:12.013
shocked a cop, so...

08:12.056 --> 08:14.537
On accident, to be fair.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.583
Yeah. Well,

08:16.626 --> 08:18.933
Danish says the boys in blue
get real miffed

08:18.976 --> 08:20.804
when you rough 'em up, so,

08:20.848 --> 08:24.852
not sure how easy
he can make this go away.

08:24.895 --> 08:27.289
You might have
to do some community service.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.900

12:44.720 --> 12:48.855
Can't you just give money
like a normal person?

12:48.898 --> 12:51.466
Come on now, Ma.
We-we don't have, uh...

12:51.509 --> 12:53.860
I mean, I-I make
a good wage, but...

12:53.903 --> 12:56.123
You have a trust.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.168
Just talk to Danish.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.562
Nothing frivolous, of course,

13:00.605 --> 13:02.782
which-- thrillers-- mm.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.045
May want to think that through
a little more.

13:05.088 --> 13:08.483
Or here's a thought.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.485
Write your own pulp fiction

13:10.528 --> 13:12.792
now that you're an outlaw.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.100
Oh.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.713
You know, Rommel wasn't a tall man.

13:25.717 --> 13:28.633
Did you brush your teeth?

13:28.677 --> 13:30.374
Mm.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.507
Okay.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.599
- Mama?
- Yeah.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.644
Are you going to jail?

13:39.688 --> 13:43.170
You mean again?
No.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.912
We're gonna get that sorted out,

13:45.955 --> 13:48.436
and I am gonna be here
when you wake up in the morning,

13:48.479 --> 13:50.525
like always.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.440
Can we have Bisquick?

13:52.483 --> 13:55.182
Silver dollar,
just like you like 'em.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.402
- You ready?
- Yeah.

13:58.446 --> 14:03.407
Okay. Pirates. Arr!

14:05.801 --> 14:07.847
"Scurvy swabs."

14:14.462 --> 14:17.595
You want to take a tumble?

14:17.639 --> 14:19.423
Oh, hon, I'm...

14:20.947 --> 14:22.513
You don't want that tonight.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.864
It was a heck of a day.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.648
I had to sponge my pits

14:26.691 --> 14:28.998
in your mom's commode
like a French lady.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.566
Yeah.
Well, maybe I like that.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.873
Caged heat.

14:35.787 --> 14:38.181
I'm flattered, believe me.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.791
But if you try
to touch me right now,

14:39.835 --> 14:41.576
I'm gonna have to tase you, too.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.101
Message received.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.455
Will it bother you
if I watch Blue Bloods?

14:52.456 --> 14:54.502
Knock yourself out.

15:38.372 --> 15:41.810
♪ Hey, Joe ♪

15:41.853 --> 15:43.551
♪ Where you goin'♪

15:43.594 --> 15:46.946
♪ With that gun in your hand?♪

16:04.746 --> 16:07.096
- Well, look at you.
- Promised her pancakes.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.098
Oh.
None for me, hon.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.926
I have the new models coming in.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.319
Want to be at the showroom
to greet 'em.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.974
- Oh.
- Scotty, the dad bus is leaving.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.845
Oh, I can take her.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.543
You know, I was thinking maybe

16:19.587 --> 16:21.241
stay away from school
for a few days.

16:21.284 --> 16:24.287
- But--
- Just-just let things cool down, huh?

16:24.331 --> 16:25.419
Come on, kid.

16:25.462 --> 16:26.942
Grab your gear.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.118
She hasn't had
her Bisquick yet. - Oh.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.728
Stop for doughnuts on the way,
how about?

16:30.772 --> 16:33.470
- Doughnuts?
- Doughn... See? -

16:33.514 --> 16:34.863
I'll be home late.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.473
- Okay.
- All right.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.040
- Here.
- All right. Oh, thanks.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.476
I'll keep your plate
in the warmer for you.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.565
- All right.
- Bye, squirt. - Bye.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.706
Come on, have a seat.

16:51.749 --> 16:54.013
Let's get started.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.189
Thank you. Wow.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.669
A Tuesday crowd
that sounds like a Friday crowd.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.236
I love it, yeah.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.108
Hmm.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.848
Ladies and gentlemen,
please say hello

17:03.892 --> 17:06.286
to my good friend.
It's Shea Wells over there.

17:06.329 --> 17:09.202
- Hello, Shea.
- Hey.

17:09.245 --> 17:11.421
Kendall is off, uh, she's continuing

17:11.465 --> 17:12.988
to recuperate

17:13.032 --> 17:14.555
from her knee surgery,
uh, so, yeah.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.470
She's, like,
best dog mom in the world.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.341
I was telling her, like,
"Your dogs are gonna be so sad

17:18.385 --> 17:20.561
- when you go back to work."
- Oh, so sad.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.519
They're spoiled
right now. - They're gonna be

17:22.563 --> 17:25.522
used to her being home and
taking care of 'em, and, yeah.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.307
Dexter likes it.
You know, when they say,

17:27.350 --> 17:29.135
uh, dogs start look like
their owners

17:29.178 --> 17:31.180
after a little while?

17:33.878 --> 17:35.837
Well, speaking of dogs,

17:35.880 --> 17:38.448
today, in studio,
we are very lucky

17:38.492 --> 17:41.669
to have highly-regarded
animal psychologist...

18:30.413 --> 18:32.111
I'm sweating in this thing.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.155
Enough of this fucking thing.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.681
Where is this bitch?

21:51.701 --> 21:54.965
Ooh.

21:55.009 --> 21:57.228
Is she dead?

22:23.646 --> 22:26.519
- Oh.
- Oh.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.651
Oh.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.923
Oh.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.370
Lady...

22:51.413 --> 22:53.197
he said alive.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.287
But he didn't say nothing about

22:56.331 --> 22:58.768
"with all her teeth."

22:58.812 --> 23:01.075
You feel me?

23:31.627 --> 23:33.847
I'm sure she just
lost track of time, slugger.

23:41.855 --> 23:44.858
Hey, pal, can you see if I left
my briefcase in the car?

23:58.959 --> 24:01.483
- You want it?
- No! I... I...

24:01.527 --> 24:03.572
You just-just stay there, okay?

24:22.417 --> 24:24.463
Hon?

24:42.785 --> 24:44.831
Oh, geez.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.507
Mr. Lyon?

25:08.550 --> 25:10.944
I threw up
in the downstairs commode.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.946
I'm saying that so when-when
you see that there,

25:12.989 --> 25:14.730
that's-that's me.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.689
Your message said you came home
and the front door was...

25:16.732 --> 25:20.388
Was wide open,
yeah, and there's... blood.

25:20.431 --> 25:21.824
I mean, you'll see, and...

25:21.868 --> 25:25.001
And no Dot. She...
You-you think she's o...

25:25.045 --> 25:27.090
Gonna need you
to stay out here, Mr. Lyon. - Okay.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.788
Forensic truck should be
pulling in shortly. Tell 'em - Yeah. Oh.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.354
I'm having a look around
the place and to come on in.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.749
I... Yeah, I-I sent Scotty
to the neighbor's, so...

25:33.793 --> 25:35.664
That was good thinking.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.623
- Did you try your wife's cell?
- Yeah, first thing.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.668
It's on the kitchen counter, so...

25:39.712 --> 25:43.324
I just... If anything
happened to her, I...

25:45.326 --> 25:47.154
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

25:47.197 --> 25:48.590
I'm gonna check
the premises now.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.553
Oh! There's
some kind of a burnt hat,

25:54.596 --> 25:56.511
maybe, upstairs.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.248
What the heck?

26:38.292 --> 26:40.555
Well, I think we have to assume this is a kidnapping.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.949
- So she's alive?
- For now.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.302
Are you crying?

26:48.345 --> 26:50.652
- No.
- Well, I'd expect a ransom demand

26:50.696 --> 26:52.611
somewhere in the next 48,

26:52.654 --> 26:55.831
- probably for some real cheese.
- Oh.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.920
You know, with-with Scotty's
school and the new fleet,

26:57.964 --> 27:00.488
I-I don't really
have that money.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.969
Wayne.
I'm the deep pockets here.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.059
Though why they think
I'd break the bank

27:06.102 --> 27:08.104
for some low-rent skirt
my son knocked up...

27:08.148 --> 27:09.889
Hey, that...

27:09.932 --> 27:13.109
Mom, that's-that's my wife
you're talking about.

27:13.153 --> 27:16.156
Don't be a baby.
You're at the grownup table.

27:16.199 --> 27:20.639
How much could we pull together,
cash, if we had to?

27:20.682 --> 27:22.815
Well, money's not the problem.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.555
The company's
cash-rich right now,

27:24.599 --> 27:26.601
what with the market volatility.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.821
And heck,
you got kidnap insurance.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.518
- Oh.
- Uh, doesn't she?

27:30.561 --> 27:32.172
Foreign and domestic.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.782
We're, uh, checking
to make sure it applies

27:33.826 --> 27:35.218
to the daughter-in-law.

27:35.262 --> 27:38.134
No, the real issue now
is process.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.136
Do we bring the FBI in

27:40.180 --> 27:42.617
or a private
hostage negotiation team?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.706
I want to keep this thing quiet.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.883
We already got enough worthless
public servants running around

27:47.927 --> 27:50.146
thinking they own the place.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.477
I'm home.

29:02.218 --> 29:05.439
Well, hon, turning in.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.963
Got to get up early on account
I'm working a big case.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.096
Kidnapping, we think.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.272
Forensics came back
two different blood types,

29:12.315 --> 29:13.752
not the victim.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.711
- Huh.
- Yeah.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.061
Slicing right again.

29:19.105 --> 29:21.411
I think
I'm dropping my shoulder.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.111
Did you put in for the regional?

29:26.112 --> 29:28.201
Twenty-five hundred bucks.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.551
No kidding.

29:30.594 --> 29:31.944
I know.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.467
Well, hon,
I don't got to tell you...

29:33.510 --> 29:35.686
- I know.
- Sears sent a final notice,

29:35.730 --> 29:37.210
and the mortgage...

29:37.253 --> 29:38.907
I said I know.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.258
Please don't get defensive.

29:42.302 --> 29:45.000
Just got out
of our skis is all,

29:45.044 --> 29:46.262
- what with the simulator.
- I told you,

29:46.306 --> 29:47.698
I need it for the winter months.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.570
Of course.

29:49.613 --> 29:52.747
I'm not saying it's superfluous.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.359
Just... maybe think about
making up a few shifts

29:56.403 --> 29:58.361
at the Red Apple again.

29:58.405 --> 30:00.059
Or we talked about,

30:00.102 --> 30:02.061
maybe you go back
to radiology school,

30:02.104 --> 30:04.541
you know, as a backup.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.763
I don't need a backup.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.765
You got your dream job,

30:10.809 --> 30:13.507
and I'm... I'm so close.

30:13.550 --> 30:16.118
You know, I came in second
at Hilton Head.

30:16.162 --> 30:18.904
Well, like I said,
got to get up early.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.429
Proud of you.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.825
Thanks. You coming?

30:26.868 --> 30:30.176
In a minute.
Just a few more drives.

31:10.216 --> 31:13.175
Shh.
Shut the fuck up already.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.482
My face. Oh...

31:15.525 --> 31:17.614
It's still there.
Stop whining.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.355
Is it cloudy in here?

31:19.399 --> 31:21.488
My eye.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.887
I'm afraid to look.

31:29.975 --> 31:34.936
Got two eyes.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.852
Could you take me
to a veterinarian?

31:42.422 --> 31:44.119
What?

31:44.163 --> 31:46.600
You know, like in the movies.

31:46.643 --> 31:49.603
'Cause they're also a doctor,
just for animals.

31:49.646 --> 31:52.475
You need to go the hospital.

31:55.652 --> 31:57.611
Burns like that,

31:57.654 --> 32:00.222
you're gonna get infected.

32:01.267 --> 32:02.485
Maybe even go to the brain.

32:02.529 --> 32:04.444
- Shut up.
- I need my brain.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.708
Not from where the driver sits.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.748
What's going on?

32:51.099 --> 32:53.449
Where did you get the truck?

32:54.711 --> 32:57.366
Stole it, like you said,
over in St. Cloud.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.281
Stole from who?

32:59.325 --> 33:01.718
You got me.
Some guy's driveway.

33:14.035 --> 33:17.082
- Christ.
- What do we do?

33:17.125 --> 33:18.648
- Shut up.
- What do we do?

33:18.692 --> 33:20.607
Shut up.

33:54.162 --> 33:57.122
There's a .38 in the glove box.

33:58.427 --> 34:00.168
And you-- don't get any funny...

34:02.040 --> 34:03.606
Geez.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.045
- Hey...
- Oh, my God.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.655
Are you okay, ma'am?

34:17.968 --> 34:19.100
Shit! Oh...

34:24.671 --> 34:28.109
Officer down!
I repeat, officer down!

34:34.985 --> 34:37.466
Christ on a stick.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.304
Come on.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.202
This is

35:17.245 --> 35:19.334
Deputy Witt Farr.
I'm on the lam,

35:19.378 --> 35:21.945
evading pursuit.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.904
Two shooters in a, uh,

35:23.947 --> 35:26.472
a dark-green F250.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.706
Hey. Hey, hey. Hey.
Wait, wait, wait,

35:43.750 --> 35:46.056
no.

35:47.275 --> 35:48.885
Oh...

36:45.551 --> 36:48.945
Son, get down before
you lose your head.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.514
- You got a back door?
- No.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.168
Oh.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.823
What about, uh, a first aid kit?

36:58.912 --> 37:00.827
Oh...

37:02.307 --> 37:04.396
- Come on!
- I got you.

37:04.439 --> 37:05.745
It's okay, it's okay.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.268
It's okay.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.489
Let me help.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.930
Just stay calm.
Backup'll be here soon.

37:22.414 --> 37:24.546
Fix your leg.
I'll check the doors.

37:24.590 --> 37:26.461
Clerk said no back door.

37:26.505 --> 37:27.593
There's a bathroom back there.

37:27.636 --> 37:28.985
It'll have a window.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.249
Right, yeah.
Yeah, good thinking.

37:53.096 --> 37:55.229
Mm...

38:07.807 --> 38:09.983
You gonna make it?

38:10.026 --> 38:12.202
Yeah, I'll get us there.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.117
I'll get us there. Oh.

38:15.075 --> 38:16.294
Oh.

39:36.112 --> 39:37.592
Oh, God.

39:51.606 --> 39:53.434
Oh...

40:02.922 --> 40:06.012
Hey. Hey,

40:06.055 --> 40:08.101
you got any weaponry
back there?

40:08.144 --> 40:11.626
Uh, shotgun? Lead pipe?

40:11.670 --> 40:13.846
Got a air horn.

40:13.889 --> 40:17.110
- A what?
- An air horn? It's, like,

40:17.153 --> 40:19.199
air in a can,
and you push the button

40:19.242 --> 40:21.331
and you...

43:35.787 --> 43:36.962
Oh!

43:37.005 --> 43:38.790
Shoot.

44:02.335 --> 44:04.337
Losing a lot of blood here.

44:23.835 --> 44:26.098
Must have hit an artery.

44:35.498 --> 44:38.066
I'm guessing there was a perp
in the commode?

44:45.813 --> 44:49.251
Put this in here.
Yeah? Okay?

44:50.992 --> 44:52.167
Okay.

44:52.211 --> 44:54.256
Now I'm gonna twist it.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.911
Yeah?

44:56.955 --> 45:00.045
Okay.
It's okay. Come on.

45:00.088 --> 45:02.047
- Can you hold it? Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:07.182 --> 45:09.402
Where'd you learn
to do all this?

45:11.317 --> 45:13.493
It's not my first getaway.

45:14.842 --> 45:17.236
Oh, sorry.

45:19.542 --> 45:22.197
Can you at least
tell me your name?

45:22.241 --> 45:25.157
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

45:27.768 --> 45:30.205
Where's the second fella?

45:30.249 --> 45:32.599
By the front door.

45:32.642 --> 45:34.079
Breathing?

46:17.383 --> 46:20.125
The cavalry's here.

46:20.168 --> 46:22.823
Come by me so they don't, uh...

46:26.000 --> 46:29.699
Ooh.

46:29.743 --> 46:31.963
Gonna put you in for a medal
when this is over.

46:32.006 --> 46:33.486
Oh.

46:33.529 --> 46:35.880
Some kind of commendation,
you know?

46:37.011 --> 46:38.796
Uh...

46:38.839 --> 46:41.407
civilian bravery or some such.

47:56.917 --> 47:58.963
We're gonna get her back.

50:23.237 --> 50:25.413
Oh. Hiya, hon.

50:26.762 --> 50:28.895
Just making sure Scotty...

50:28.938 --> 50:31.419
Well, she didn't
get her Bisquick yesterday.

50:31.463 --> 50:33.508
Oh, hon.

50:35.162 --> 50:36.598
Oh, geez, you're bleeding.

50:37.556 --> 50:38.948
I am?

50:38.992 --> 50:42.169
Oh, would you look at that.

50:42.213 --> 50:45.651
Well, I just feel like
the silliest.

50:45.694 --> 50:49.089
We-Well, what the heck happened?

50:49.133 --> 50:50.221
Some kind of break-in?

50:50.264 --> 50:52.658
The-the... the blood and, like,

50:52.701 --> 50:55.530
the hair?

50:55.574 --> 50:57.837
Oh, hon, are... are you okay?

50:57.880 --> 51:00.318
Stop being so ridiculous.

51:00.361 --> 51:01.623
I just must have

51:01.667 --> 51:04.670
cut myself is all, earlier.

51:04.713 --> 51:06.324
And, well,

51:06.367 --> 51:09.675
you know, yesterday
was a tough pill to swallow,

51:09.718 --> 51:11.981
so I thought
I could go somewhere,

51:12.025 --> 51:13.374
clear my head.

51:14.767 --> 51:17.987
But, uh, I'm... Wh-Wh...

51:18.031 --> 51:19.554
Two types of blood they found.

51:19.598 --> 51:23.254
- Yep.
- Ya, O-O-negative and, um...

51:23.297 --> 51:25.865
Well, I forgot the other one,
but not yours.

51:25.908 --> 51:29.042
A-And the deal with the, uh,
the... the ski mask

51:29.086 --> 51:31.653
- all scorched and stuff?
- Ya.

51:31.697 --> 51:33.438
Uh, I had
some of the winter things out,

51:33.481 --> 51:35.222
prepping for
the seasonal changeover.

51:35.266 --> 51:37.311
- Ya?
- And I guess I must have put 'em

51:37.355 --> 51:40.271
too close to the curlers,
and it, uh...

51:40.314 --> 51:42.055
Oh...

51:42.099 --> 51:44.318
You must think
I'm some kind of fool.

51:44.362 --> 51:47.408
Oh, no.
No, of course...

51:47.452 --> 51:48.540
of course not, I just...

51:48.583 --> 51:50.455
Uh... Wh-Wh...

51:50.498 --> 51:53.327
What-what are you saying?
'Cause the cops were here.

51:53.371 --> 51:57.418
Uh, that-that Indian lady,
and she said, uh...

51:57.462 --> 52:00.073
"abducted by force"
is what she... And-and then

52:00.117 --> 52:01.770
I'm at my mom's figuring
out a ransom strategy...

52:01.814 --> 52:03.642
You told your mom?

52:03.685 --> 52:07.428
Yeah, hon, there was...

52:07.472 --> 52:08.908
You were abducted.

52:08.951 --> 52:10.475
Stop saying that.

52:11.867 --> 52:13.130
I had a bad day.

52:13.173 --> 52:15.436
I needed some time
to clear my head.

52:16.524 --> 52:18.918
Did I leave the house a mess?

52:18.961 --> 52:20.615
Well, shoot.

52:23.879 --> 52:27.448
I know you think
I'm this kinda perfect woman--

52:27.492 --> 52:30.103
wife, mother--

52:30.147 --> 52:33.672
but you know,
even I got a breaking point.

52:56.085 --> 52:58.827
Now, you want to set the table
for breakfast?

52:58.871 --> 53:01.178
Got to make sure Scotty
gets her vitamins and minerals

53:01.221 --> 53:04.137
for school.
Most important meal of the day.

55:56.831 --> 55:58.877
Now I get it.
