WEBVTT

01:15.366 --> 01:17.446
I repeat, we do not see the ship.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.745
I do.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.372
It's right outside the window.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.705
Cortez is dead.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.460
Send the coordinates
to Dr. Fielding at JPL.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.462
Ken!

01:25.752 --> 01:28.592
I don't read the coordinates.
I need them here at JPL.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.381
Major Collins, go to manual.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.295
Put the coordinates on the crypto-key

01:32.383 --> 01:35.433
and get it down to Dr. Fielding
at JPL yourself.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.893
Come on! Come on!

01:40.975 --> 01:42.595
Major Collins, get out of there.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.163
Where's your retainer?

01:58.243 --> 02:01.663
Mom, NASA's testing new boosters
using solid rocket fuel.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.286
Those things can incinerate anything.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.623
Anything else we're forgetting?

02:04.707 --> 02:06.127
Sunscreen, good.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.039
You ready, bud?

02:08.044 --> 02:09.424
Just a few more minutes.

02:09.545 --> 02:12.006
Sweetie, you don't need any more time
in that chair.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.425
If you're worried about my posture,
this chair is ergonomic.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.300
Look, my spine just perfectly aligns.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.430
Alex, honey,

02:20.932 --> 02:23.562
there is a whole world out there
beyond these screens.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.273
There's nothing to worry about.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.943
You're gonna make friends.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.280
I have friends.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.570

03:20.033 --> 03:21.163

Dariush...

03:24.078 --> 03:25.038
I love you, son.

03:25.747 --> 03:26.957
No matter what.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.878
All right, Jacobi, let's bounce.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.718
What did you say your relationship
was again?

03:42.847 --> 03:43.677
She's my niece.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.767
It's my sister-in-law's.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.600
You can kinda see it in the eyes.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.403
What's your business here?

03:49.771 --> 03:52.651
She's got a spelling bee out in Camarillo.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.573
How many L's in Camarillo?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.868
You're gonna do good in America.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.877
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.100
You're light. Nope. More.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.096
There you go.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.559
Pleasure doing business with you, kid.

Where to?

04:42.824 --> 04:44.414
Rim of the World. Okay.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.827
You know, I went to camp
when I was a little girl.

04:49.914 --> 04:50.924
You've said.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.670
That's where I met Flora Beetworth.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.592
I mean, I met a lot of cool people,
but she was the coolest.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.592
It's okay, Alex.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.466
Are sure you wanna take
your dad's watch?

05:08.182 --> 05:10.602
Mom, I'll take care of the watch.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.002
Come on, honey.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.252
Come on, you can do this.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.882
It's going to be great.
Look how beautiful it is.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.343
Rim of the World.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.548
This is gonna be so awesome.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.391
Look at all the other kids your age.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.516
Alex! I am your leader, Logan.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.390
Now, if you look around,
you'll see a lot of interesting things.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.518
First interesting thing we have
is Carl right here.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.475
He is the black man on the campus.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.685
We gonna teach you
about black culture, pay attention,

05:59.776 --> 06:01.026
gonna only do this once. Ready?

06:03.112 --> 06:04.912
Snap!
That's called the black man handshake.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.544
Okay, don't wanna see you
doing that. Only for black people.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.539
Oh, hey, use retail method
when folding my clothes, Jacobi.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.462
Okay? I don't wanna see any creases.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.541
- Retail what?
- Retail method.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.047
- What's that?
- What rich people do. You wouldn't know.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.919
Don't turn your back,
I'll slap you.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.716
- They're just kidding.
- Alex, look, see we got music over here.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.471
- ♪ ...trees and the sky... ♪
- Music!

06:26.552 --> 06:28.472
Come on, Alex, dance a little bit.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.684
You know how to dance?

06:30.181 --> 06:33.231
You always wanted to learn
how to play guitar... and dancing.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.976
Keep playing, I'm dancing.
Keep playing, I'm dancing.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.862
♪ I'm very uncomfortable
These girls are uncomfortable ♪

06:39.941 --> 06:42.151
Oh, I'm sorry, ladies. Cool.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.695
Maybe next time, no originals,
play the people what they want.

06:44.779 --> 06:45.609
Let's go.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.411
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.411
Uh, this, this is Conrad right here, okay.
Conrad, he's a little...

06:51.494 --> 06:53.204
Look at these people
you're meeting.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.157
Sheesh, Conrad.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.247
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

06:55.331 --> 06:57.381
Welcome to the jungle, ginger nugget.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.288
Nope, can't call him that.
Second of all, put your titties away.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.708
What? These titties?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.836
Don't bounce the titties,
I told you to put them away.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.093
Why's your shirt so small?
It can't even connect.

07:06.175 --> 07:09.095
You must be Alex!

07:09.470 --> 07:12.560
Welcome to the Rim of the World
Adventure Camp.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.346
Thanks.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.015
Back there is registration,
get checked in, get your cabin number.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.363
And we'll sign you up
for some afternoon activities.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.229
Hey, how are your pipes?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.278
- What?
- Our musical this year

07:23.359 --> 07:24.609
is Fiddler on the Roof!

07:25.236 --> 07:28.026
♪ If I were a rich man
La da da da da... ♪

07:29.115 --> 07:30.525
Wait a second.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.236
I think I just found my Tevye.

07:32.326 --> 07:35.366
You're going to have a heck of a time.
Very exciting!

07:43.463 --> 07:45.383
I offer greetings, my fair princess.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.852
I humbly submit my name, Alex.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.137
She seemed nice.

07:58.644 --> 07:59.564
All right, who's next?

08:02.023 --> 08:02.943
China?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.230
Okay, um...

08:05.318 --> 08:06.238
No, no, no.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.199
Ni hao!

08:07.403 --> 08:08.283
Um...

08:09.363 --> 08:13.583
Welcome... to... camp!

08:14.076 --> 08:15.196
I love...

08:15.745 --> 08:17.115
Jackie Chan.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.083
Do you understand the words
comin' out of my mouth? Okay?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.416
Move along.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.918
Wow. China.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.974
My man, where you been, baby?
You remember the black man hand...

08:28.382 --> 08:30.432
- Nope.
- You said I can't do it.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.510
I was testing you.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.097
Good shit, baby. Good shit. Move along.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.474
You gotta start
wearing the silk.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.847
That's what gets the girls.
You can't wear-- Never mind.

08:41.102 --> 08:41.982
Ooh!

08:43.022 --> 08:44.362
Mmm-mm-mm.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.572
Put it in my box.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.396
I'm sorry. What?

08:47.902 --> 08:48.902
Put it in my box.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.195
- Uh...
- Just take it out and put it in my box.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.196
Oh...

08:54.492 --> 08:56.492
You saying in front of a lot of people
right now.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.537
You sure about that?

08:58.037 --> 09:00.407
Can you put
your cell phone in the box, please?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.540
Whoo! Phone!

09:03.167 --> 09:05.877
Yes. Yeah, I thought
you meant something else.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.342
- I was...
- What'd you think I meant?

09:07.421 --> 09:10.171
You don't wanna know
what I thought you were...

09:10.258 --> 09:11.968
- Dariush. Did you...?
- No, no, no, no.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.301
- Dariush.
- I didn't think that, no. I didn't...

09:14.387 --> 09:15.597
- Oh...
- I didn't...

09:16.264 --> 09:18.184
You know what, to be honest with you,

09:19.225 --> 09:20.685
I left my phone at home.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.981
- I don't have my cell phone with me.
- Ah. Okay.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.113
Okay, I better say goodbye to you now
before I embarrass you in public.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.108
You know what that means?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.029
No, Mom!

09:32.196 --> 09:35.276
♪ Ain't no mountain high enough ♪

09:35.366 --> 09:36.826

10:17.783 --> 10:18.743
Hold this.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.292
What's up, tool?

10:20.703 --> 10:21.543
You ready?

10:21.621 --> 10:22.871
This is gonna be fun.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.462
Cool helmet.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.418

Don't look down.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.480
All right, Zhenzhen, you are good to go.
Safety first.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.983
Mm-hmm. 'Sup, girl? I'm Dariush.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.571
Is this a layover because we're making
that connection, you feel me?

10:55.321 --> 10:56.821
Oh, all right.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.367
That pickup line was the worst
I've ever heard, man.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.160
I got game. Girls fall when they see me.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.543
Yeah, they fall off the zip line
and almost commit suicide.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.711
No, they fall in love.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.539
- Is that right?
- That's right. Like that one?

11:07.625 --> 11:10.085
It was cool...
But you should've said it to her, not me.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.959
- Next time.
- Don't use it on me.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.546
Carrot Top's up next, you ready, Alex?

11:13.631 --> 11:15.551
Let's do this, baby. Come on.
Come to the edge.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.585
Look, right over to the edge. There we go.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.176
Come on, come to the edge.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.102
- All you gotta do is breathe.
- I can't. I can't.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.771
Breathe. Look at me. Look at me,
all you gotta do is breathe. Okay?

11:24.850 --> 11:28.310
Close your eyes and when you open them
you'll be on the other side.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.226
- I can't, I can't, I can't!
- The other side of the zip line...

11:32.274 --> 11:34.114
You won't die, you won't die!

11:34.735 --> 11:35.565
Okay.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.817
Maybe camp's just not for you.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.195
Okay?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.422
Hey, hey, stop.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.576
So, you're this summer's chickenshit, huh?

12:09.270 --> 12:12.730
A NASA spokeswoman has said
"The agency's repeated attempts

12:12.815 --> 12:15.605
to contact the International Space Station
are failing."

12:15.860 --> 12:18.400
But stopped short
of revealing possible causes.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.032
When asked if the ISS

12:20.114 --> 12:22.284
and it's three scientists onboard
could be in danger,

12:22.366 --> 12:25.156
the agency held firm
that it is doing everything it can

12:25.244 --> 12:26.584
to restore communication.

12:26.662 --> 12:29.332
Meanwhile, reports
of observed troop movements...

12:31.709 --> 12:33.459
- Toy Story was messed up.
- How?

12:33.544 --> 12:35.504
Take the third one, for example,
that teenager,

12:35.588 --> 12:36.958
he represents the white folks.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.263
Huh?

12:38.340 --> 12:40.720
And Cowboy, Spaceman
and Mr. and Mrs. Potato-people,

12:40.801 --> 12:42.051
they represent the brothers.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.046
- Okay, so let me get this straight.
- Uh-huh.

12:44.638 --> 12:45.888
- We're the toys.
- Preach.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.523
And when the white man leaves the room,
we get to have fun.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.691
We get to shake it up.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.269
But when the white man
comes back in,

12:51.353 --> 12:53.273
we gotta get stiff
and do what they tell us to do.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.475
Now you're on my level.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.525
So it's obviously the ruling class
justification

12:56.609 --> 12:58.739
for the inferior conditions
of the working class.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.949
- My brother!
- What about Finding Nemo?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.910
Don't say nothing bad
about Finding Nemo.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.240
Okay, Alex!

13:04.325 --> 13:07.285
One more question. Why are we
talking like black men from the '80s?

13:07.369 --> 13:09.579
- That's what they want us to do.
- Preach, brother.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.253
Got us with all these white kids,

13:11.332 --> 13:12.922
- you see any black kids?
- I see one.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.460
Dariush? He got enough money,
he damn near white.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.221
Alex.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.262
Alex. Alex!

13:23.344 --> 13:24.764
Alex, come on!

13:56.502 --> 13:57.752
All right, keep up.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.627
I can't feel my legs.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.093
I'm falling behind.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.627
I'm so tired!

14:10.015 --> 14:10.925
Move! Shotgun!

14:17.106 --> 14:18.266
Yep, yep, yep!

14:18.899 --> 14:19.899
Campers in the back.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.941
- What?
- Campers in the back.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.818
Rosa Parks fought for my right
to sit up here, so...

14:24.905 --> 14:26.065
- Really, dude?
- Keep driving.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.946
Rosa ain't fight for shit
for your lil' chunky ass, get in the back.

14:29.618 --> 14:32.498
And don't slam my door,
you little thick ass-- Don't slam my door!

14:35.124 --> 14:37.504
- All right. y'all the king is back.
- Come on, Dariush.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.455
All right, scoot over, man.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.549
- Move, man. My nuts is hot.
- Sorry.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.052
You're making me chafe, scoot over.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.554
Hope y'all not afraid of sharks.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.644
Put y'all seat belt on.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.389
'Cause my license is suspended.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.975
Wait, your license is suspended?

14:53.058 --> 14:55.018
- Just a little bit.
- What does that mean?

14:55.102 --> 14:56.942
It means let's not get pulled over.

15:04.194 --> 15:08.414
Ah, sorry guys, some kid shit the canoe
while shooting the rapids.

15:08.782 --> 15:09.782
Aw!

15:09.909 --> 15:12.909
Hey, Cosmo, we're gonna need
the second hose down here.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.365
It'll just be a few more minutes.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.075
What? Ain't nobody scared of a little poo.

15:16.165 --> 15:20.535
Okay, I am deathly afraid of a lot of poo.
It's more poo than canoe in there.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.456
Two kids shit the van on the way here
and we still made it.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.967
And I don't want to be Patient Zero
for a pink eye epidemic.

15:26.050 --> 15:26.880
So just calm down.

15:27.509 --> 15:30.219
Wait a minute, we here for canoeing?
I thought we was motorboating.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.636
You like that? Gimme some.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.144
Okay, you know what?
That's inappropriate, Dariush.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.476
Although I am flattered.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.560
- Is that a new necklace?
- Is that a new hat?

15:40.648 --> 15:42.688
It is.
I got it at Paradise Island.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.855
Where are you going?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.493
It makes your eyes pop.

15:50.783 --> 15:51.873
Zhenzhen!

15:53.285 --> 15:55.365
Zhenzhen, do you know where you're going?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.457
I don't think we should wander this far.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.290
Maybe we should head back?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.719
Zhenzhen, do you know how to get back?

16:17.142 --> 16:18.352
Hello?

16:48.674 --> 16:49.554
Ooh!

16:51.927 --> 16:52.887
What are you doing here?

16:53.762 --> 16:55.012
Just dropped a deuce.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.229
Shit I just took back there,
been touching cloth since last night.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.694
- What?
- Yeah.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.858
Between me and you, I just turned
the evergreens brown up in this joint.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.268
Let me talk to you for a minute.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.516
- No, don't touch me.
- Come on.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.227
- It's exposure therapy.
- That's unsanitary.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.857
I'm gonna help you conquer your fear.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.114
No! What? Wait, no. No!

17:10.194 --> 17:11.775
- Please, no.
- I'm helping you, calm down.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.664
- It's okay, I got you.
- Please, no, no, no, no.

17:13.741 --> 17:14.951
- Look down.
- No, please.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.493
- I'm trying to help you.
- Please, no.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.617
- Yeah, you can.
- No, please!

17:17.703 --> 17:19.413
- Stop. I can't. Let go.
- I'm trying to help.

17:19.496 --> 17:20.656
- Calm down, man.
- No, please!

17:20.748 --> 17:21.578
Let him go!

17:21.665 --> 17:22.665
I'm trying to--

17:23.541 --> 17:24.462
Let him go.

17:27.628 --> 17:29.169
Move along, mountain hobo.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.218
- We've got no qualms with you.
- No.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.390
- Help me. Help me!
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.299
Huh?

17:36.555 --> 17:37.715
Uh-huh. Come over here.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.350
- Oh, ow.
- Big mistake, bro.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.935
Ow!

17:43.020 --> 17:46.400
Ooh. Five years of Krav Maga, bitch.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.817
I'll Gal Gadot you so hard right now.
What's your ground game?

17:49.902 --> 17:52.242
What? What? Unh!

17:54.865 --> 17:55.695
You okay?

17:57.451 --> 17:58.371
Thanks.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.084
Yeah.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.039
- Who are you?
- My name is Gabriel.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.632
You live around here?

18:08.962 --> 18:10.342
Yeah. Yeah.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.222
You guys are from the, um,
the camp, right?

18:17.596 --> 18:20.766
- She's not much of a talker.
- You know what? You know...

18:21.308 --> 18:23.138
You know what? That was a lucky punch.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.608
Lucky punch. Yeah, you know,
I haven't acclimated to the altitudes yet.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.318
- So my reflexes are kinda...
- sub-par.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.286
What the hell was that?

18:44.832 --> 18:45.752
What does it say?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.415
It's the emergency broadcast system.

18:48.502 --> 18:52.092
"All civilians are to evacuate
metropolitan areas immediately.

18:52.172 --> 18:55.222
Under no circumstances
approach any unknown aircraft."

18:56.635 --> 18:57.925
It's the next 7-Eleven.

18:58.595 --> 18:59.965
We gotta get back to the van.

19:00.681 --> 19:01.721
Anyone know the way?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.351
- Uh...
- I do.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.138
Follow me.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.937
Okay. Whoa! Whoa.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.520
Slow your roll, Dora the Explorer,
all right, this is my clique.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.276
Soldiers, out!

19:13.110 --> 19:14.030
Let's go.

19:14.945 --> 19:15.945
You guys know if--

19:17.823 --> 19:18.663
You--

19:22.953 --> 19:24.003
Everyone's gone!

19:25.038 --> 19:26.118
Assholes!

19:28.041 --> 19:30.291
Probably got the emergency signal
and went back to camp.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.707
Oh!

19:35.757 --> 19:36.927
What the fu--?

19:37.509 --> 19:39.799
Looks like explosions,
in the upper atmosphere.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.177
Call and have them send
the van to pick you up.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.814
It's dead!
I had 90% two seconds ago.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.142
Piece of shit Boost Mobile.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.306
Mine's dead, too.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.829
- Whoa! Ah!
- Ah!

20:04.953 --> 20:06.623
Oh my God, it's Independence Day.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.671
It's June, Gabriel!

20:10.125 --> 20:12.205
Oh, wait, maybe North Korea's invaded!

20:12.294 --> 20:13.344
Zhenzhen, call it off!

20:14.463 --> 20:17.673
We just need to wait here until the adults
realize they left us and come back.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.048
Oh, man! What if they never come back?

20:20.135 --> 20:21.885
I'm gonna die here with you losers?

20:21.970 --> 20:23.640
I never even had sex before!

20:27.267 --> 20:29.057
I'ma clear that up. I had sex...

20:29.228 --> 20:31.228
I had sex before, I mean...

20:31.313 --> 20:33.823
I haven't had sex with two girls at once.
That's what I mean.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.359
- I told you I had sex 'cause...
- No.

20:35.442 --> 20:38.742
All right, hey, look. We're not gonna die!
It's probably just a forest fire.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.910
We gotta get going,
bears out here can be crazy.

20:40.989 --> 20:43.779
Whoa! Whoa! Okay, slow your roll.
Did you just say bears?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.697
I don't do so well with bears, man.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.906
I'm not trying to get DiCaprio'd
up in here!

20:47.996 --> 20:51.416
- Look, no one does well with bears.
- Oh, whoa. Uh...

20:51.667 --> 20:53.417
ask Werner Herzog.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.762
Grizzly Man lived with those things
for years, so check that out.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.968
- Did you watch the end of that movie?
- "Did I watch..."

20:59.049 --> 21:02.299
- Yeah, I watched-- No, I didn't.
- No, dude. Okay, stop. Gabriel's right.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.426
Black bears are opportunistic carnivores.
We're not gonna survive the wilderness

21:05.514 --> 21:08.434
- through the night.
- Then let's go! Come on!

21:12.271 --> 21:13.311
Hello!

21:14.856 --> 21:15.726
Hello!

21:17.609 --> 21:18.649
Where is everybody?

21:19.820 --> 21:20.900
Is anyone here?

21:21.738 --> 21:23.158
Yo, do you see anybody?

21:25.575 --> 21:26.825
What's that?

21:26.910 --> 21:28.040
"Gone down mountain..."

21:28.704 --> 21:30.214
Oh, they left us!

21:30.872 --> 21:31.872
Oh, sh--

21:32.708 --> 21:35.838
- Not all of them!
- Huh? It's Heavy Metal Conrad.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.339
- Conrad!
- Conrad!

21:37.754 --> 21:38.674
Is he dead?

21:39.548 --> 21:42.048
He's breathing. He must have slept
through the evacuation.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.344
Okay, what kind of asshole
sleeps through an evacuation?

21:45.220 --> 21:46.180
Wake him up.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.096
Uh...

21:53.228 --> 21:54.978
I don't think that... that was milk.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.241
Line's dead.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.202
It's 'cause the power's out.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.451
You know what an EMP is?

22:05.532 --> 22:08.162
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's that music white people dance to.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.542
No, that's EDM!

22:09.703 --> 22:11.913
EPM stands for electromagnetic pulse.

22:12.539 --> 22:15.169
A nuclear explosion
in the upper atmosphere can cause one.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.709
And it knocks out most electronics,
over a really big area.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.129
But what does that mean?

22:20.589 --> 22:22.219
It means nothing works.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.761
Not even cars?

22:24.217 --> 22:26.347
Well, you guys have food
and a roof over your head.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.888
You could do a lot worse than staying

22:27.971 --> 22:30.021
- and waiting this out.
- Wait, waiting what out?

22:31.099 --> 22:32.809
Shit! Come on, come on, come on!

22:44.321 --> 22:46.491
Those are F-22 Raptor
air superiority fighters.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.084
What are those ships
they're fighting?

22:49.159 --> 22:51.039
I've never seen anything like them.

22:53.163 --> 22:56.123
Run! Go, get the hell out here. Go!

22:56.249 --> 22:58.039
Hurry up!

22:59.002 --> 23:00.212
Go, go, go!

23:00.587 --> 23:02.587
Move out of the way!

23:03.924 --> 23:05.344
Come on, come on!

23:05.967 --> 23:06.927
Go!

23:07.928 --> 23:09.428
Oh! Look out!

23:09.513 --> 23:11.103
- Look out, look out!
- Whoa!

23:22.442 --> 23:23.782
What's going on?

23:28.615 --> 23:29.525
What?

23:44.548 --> 23:46.378
What is that?

23:46.466 --> 23:49.886
- It's a Dragon capsule.
- How do you know all this stuff?

23:49.970 --> 23:52.510
There's a reason my mom sent me
to outdoor camp.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.680
Oh, God, that thing's huge.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.274
What the hell?

23:56.351 --> 23:58.021
- No, don't touch it! Dude!
- Oh! Ah!

23:58.103 --> 23:59.443
It's still hot from re-entry.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.273
- Oh, does anyone have any water?
- Good idea.

24:02.691 --> 24:03.531
Thanks. thanks.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.112
Mmm...

24:07.070 --> 24:08.030
You serious?

24:10.115 --> 24:10.985
- What?
- Gimme it.

24:11.074 --> 24:11.914
What?

24:13.326 --> 24:15.036
You're not gonna open that thing, are you?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.580
There could be someone inside.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.123
No, leave it be. All right?

24:18.707 --> 24:21.377
- What?
- We don't know what this shit is.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.627
- Don't touch it.
- Ew.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.632
This is animal kingdom out here, bitches.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.844
All right, survival of the fit--

24:37.893 --> 24:40.153
Hello. Is... is anybody in here?

24:50.155 --> 24:52.315
Ah!

24:52.407 --> 24:53.277
Guys!

24:55.160 --> 24:56.660
Come on, come on, come on!

24:56.745 --> 24:58.745
I thought space was supposed
to make you weightless?

24:58.830 --> 25:00.960
We're not in space, dude.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.131
- Where am I?
- At Rim of the World Adventure Camp.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.844
- Near Big Bear.
- This is a camp?

25:09.132 --> 25:10.552
Yeah, I was disappointed too, but...

25:11.009 --> 25:12.469
Coordinates all wrong.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.971
Pasadena... Dr. Fielding.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.465
I'm sorry, but we're not near Pasadena
right now.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.307
- JPL!
- JPL?

25:19.392 --> 25:21.522
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
It's part of NASA.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.193
Try not to move as much, okay?

25:23.313 --> 25:25.233
- Try not to move as much.
- The key!

25:25.857 --> 25:26.687
The key.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.988
Take it to JPL, Dr. Fielding.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.359
It has everything on it.
Excalibur, everything.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.236
Go!

25:33.365 --> 25:35.075
What the actual shit?

25:35.450 --> 25:38.160
- You're gonna die if we leave you.
- We'll all die if you don't!

25:38.745 --> 25:39.905
Run!

25:45.794 --> 25:46.964
Was that an alien?

25:47.087 --> 25:47.997
Run!

25:49.464 --> 25:50.974
Keep going, come on! Let's go!

26:03.103 --> 26:04.403
It has a dog!

26:04.479 --> 26:05.809
Alex! Come on!

26:12.445 --> 26:13.945
Hey, wait! Wait, wait!

26:14.030 --> 26:14.950
How big was it?

26:15.031 --> 26:17.991
Was it, like, puppy-size?
'Cause maybe it just wants to cuddle.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.699
Hell, no! We have to go!

26:28.587 --> 26:30.257
Alex, come here.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.472
Dariush. Come here.
Dariush. Come here.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.261
Oh!

27:08.376 --> 27:09.626
Thank you, Baby Jesus!

27:19.638 --> 27:20.968
No!

27:29.981 --> 27:31.481
Help me, help me! I'm coming!

27:43.578 --> 27:44.408
Go, go.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.748
Go, go. Go, go. Run! Run!

27:52.337 --> 27:53.627
Shit! Let's go!

27:53.713 --> 27:54.713
Come on! Let's go!

28:09.187 --> 28:10.647
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

28:33.920 --> 28:34.960
Where is it?

28:44.889 --> 28:47.309
Oh, shit!

28:52.605 --> 28:53.815
Shh.

28:55.775 --> 28:57.065
Stop talking. Shh.

28:57.193 --> 28:58.283
Stop...

29:05.744 --> 29:08.544
- He's coming, we have to hide. Please.
- Shh! Shh!

29:13.835 --> 29:15.545
He's coming, he's coming.

29:21.217 --> 29:23.547
That's fecal suicide! No!

29:28.725 --> 29:30.185
Crap!

29:31.311 --> 29:33.351
Ugh! Not sanitary.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.361
We gotta go. Come on.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.572
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29:38.902 --> 29:41.452
Why are we leaving?
This an alien-proof hiding spot.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.739
- We have to help them.
- And die too?

29:44.657 --> 29:46.157
- No, thanks!
- Just go! Go!

29:46.242 --> 29:47.162
No, come on.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.253
No, wait, look... Gabriel!

29:51.206 --> 29:52.416
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

29:56.753 --> 29:57.673
Now what?

30:00.882 --> 30:02.722
Aw, hell, naw, man!

30:07.514 --> 30:08.604
Oh, shit! Come on!

30:08.681 --> 30:10.271
Go, go, go. Go!

30:15.146 --> 30:16.186
Shh.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.832
What the hell?

30:26.908 --> 30:29.288
It's Conrad. Conrad.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.326
Conrad. Conrad!
Hey. Hey, Conrad.

30:48.888 --> 30:49.718
Dariush.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.018
Go, go!

30:52.225 --> 30:53.475
Speed your ass up, Gabriel!

30:53.893 --> 30:54.943
It's Cujo.

30:55.019 --> 30:55.849
Go!

30:55.937 --> 30:57.227
Oh, shit, get the door!

30:57.897 --> 30:59.767
- What?
- Get the door! Get the door!

31:00.817 --> 31:02.487
It's coming.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.821
- Come on, get in here!
- I forgot the door!

31:17.041 --> 31:18.501
Where is it? You see it?

31:18.918 --> 31:19.958
- No.
- I don't see it!

31:20.503 --> 31:21.673
- Oh!
- No!

31:21.754 --> 31:23.554
Guys, come on. Let's go!

31:23.631 --> 31:25.551
- Leave! The dog is out there!
- Leave!

31:25.633 --> 31:27.183
We can't hear you!

31:27.260 --> 31:28.850
- Go away! The dog's out there.
- Go!

31:40.648 --> 31:42.358
We gotta let 'em in, we gotta let 'em in!

31:42.442 --> 31:44.072
No. What are you doing? "Let them in." No!

31:46.696 --> 31:49.196
Zhenzhen? Zhenzhen.

31:51.367 --> 31:52.447
Leave it alone!

31:52.535 --> 31:54.615
- Come on!
- Leave the buttons alone. Stop it!

32:03.046 --> 32:04.296
You wanna die?

32:13.389 --> 32:14.219
Oh, shoot!

32:14.849 --> 32:16.849
Alex, you're welcome.

32:17.226 --> 32:19.306
I put the dog on fire for you guys!

32:19.479 --> 32:21.979
And Gabriel was selfish
and he didn't help at all.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.357
What button do I press to open
this window? Help me!

32:29.364 --> 32:30.324
Go.

32:35.078 --> 32:35.998
I think we got it.

32:43.002 --> 32:46.422
At what point do we trip Zhenzhen
and keep running?

33:14.742 --> 33:16.452
I didn't sign up for this shit, man.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.866
This can't be real.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.617
What about this isn't real?
He just sneeze-jizzed all over us!

33:21.708 --> 33:23.998
Just shut up, I can't think
with your constant bitching.

33:24.085 --> 33:27.875
Hey, I'm allowed to bitch, all right?
That thing had its tongue in my mouth.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.344
How do you know it was its tongue?

33:29.799 --> 33:30.879
We don't know their anatomy.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.007
What are you saying?

33:32.093 --> 33:34.473
Honestly, it's plausible that
sophisticated creatures,

33:34.554 --> 33:36.684
like alien males, have cranial genitalia.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.349
It had its dick in my mouth?

33:43.438 --> 33:44.518
Yeah.

33:45.773 --> 33:46.773
Uh-uh.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.319
Guys, we need to stay calm, okay?

33:48.401 --> 33:49.611
We need to stay calm.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.361
Calm?

33:51.446 --> 33:54.656
I just probably swallowed
a load of alien babies

33:54.741 --> 33:57.541
that are gonna turn into puppies
and leap out of my chest.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.618
I need to find my mom,
she's gonna know what to do.

33:59.704 --> 34:00.964
If she's alive.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.575
Hey, don't say that.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.375
Chances are our parents are gone,
all right!

34:04.459 --> 34:06.249
Hey, what did I say about
touching that kid?

34:06.461 --> 34:08.420
What are you gonna do?
Gonna sucker punch me again?

34:08.504 --> 34:10.424
Go for it,
'cause I chop your ass in the neck,

34:10.505 --> 34:11.876
and then I'll chop you in the head

34:11.966 --> 34:14.466
- and finish you with a rear-naked choke.
- Do you ever shut up?

34:14.552 --> 34:16.722
I mean, between my fist
and that alien's dick,

34:16.804 --> 34:18.934
your mouth should be worn out by now.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.518
Why are you hitting me?

34:23.603 --> 34:25.023
What we do in life...

34:25.855 --> 34:27.514
echoes in eternity.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.534
What the fuck?

34:32.152 --> 34:33.152
Hold the line!

34:33.987 --> 34:34.987
Stay with me.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.371
If you find yourself alone,
riding in green fields

34:38.451 --> 34:40.291
with the sun on your face,
do not be troubled.

34:41.036 --> 34:42.657
For you are in Elysium,

34:43.039 --> 34:44.418
and you're already dead.

34:46.958 --> 34:48.708
Did she just quote Gladiator?

34:49.045 --> 34:50.835
Since when did she speak English?

34:51.714 --> 34:52.974
Since when does she speak?

34:53.966 --> 34:55.716
- May I ask where we're going?
- My jaw hurts...

34:55.802 --> 34:57.222
The astronaut said that this key

34:57.303 --> 34:59.893
can stop the aliens
and we need to take it to TRL.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.098
JPL.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.732
- A NASA facility.
- Tastes like truffle butter.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.270
In the foothills of Pasadena.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.770
I went there once for a robotics contest
with my dad.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.068
- Do you know how to get there?
- Without GPS?

35:11.150 --> 35:13.990
No, probably not.
It's over 70 miles away from here.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

35:16.030 --> 35:18.410
Wait, you wanna head 70 miles
into the city?

35:18.491 --> 35:20.741
The alert said stay out
of metropolitan areas,

35:20.827 --> 35:21.947
not head straight into them.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.076
We don't have to take it all the way
to Pasadena.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.584
Let's just get this key down the mountain
and take it to adults.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.587
Tell them to take it to JPL.

35:30.670 --> 35:31.960
Oh, my gosh.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.513
Guys.

35:35.424 --> 35:38.394
There's a sheriff's station down a bit,
we could get it to a cop.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.139
That's a great idea, Gabriel.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.771
Now, let's get some bikes
and kick some ass.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.975
Damn, girl,
your English is good.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.941
They gave us the code at registration,
it's, um...

35:49.021 --> 35:49.941
six-six-nine.

35:50.690 --> 35:51.900
Come on, man.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.031
Hurry up, dude. Come on.
It's six-six-nine.

35:57.321 --> 35:58.781
Six... nine...

35:58.865 --> 36:01.025
Dude, what are you talking about?
I said six-six-nine.

36:01.868 --> 36:05.368
Come on, man. Dude, hurry up!
Just put it in there. What are you, dumb?

36:07.623 --> 36:08.463
I'm not dumb.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.173
Here, Gabriel. Let me help you.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.005
I want this one,
it's got a 'Wakanda Forever' sticker.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.432
Hey... what's wrong?

36:24.849 --> 36:25.849
I can't go with you.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.306
Why not?

36:29.854 --> 36:30.864
I can't ride a bike.

36:31.564 --> 36:32.444
I never learned.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.112
It's okay.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.146
You guys can go without me.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.908
- Cool, we out!
- No.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.118
We got back down to your camp
and everyone left you,

36:41.199 --> 36:42.489
how did that make you feel?

36:42.575 --> 36:45.075
All right, you get on one side of Alex
and you get on the other,

36:45.161 --> 36:46.541
and we'll get him up to speed.

36:46.621 --> 36:47.581
- Gotcha.
- All right?

36:50.625 --> 36:51.955
I won't let you fall.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.264
You guys are...

37:03.429 --> 37:04.259
I...

37:13.314 --> 37:14.274
You got this.

37:14.523 --> 37:16.363
Put your feet back on the pedal.

37:16.442 --> 37:18.152
The key is to get moving.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.856
The faster you go,
the easier it is to stay balanced.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.657
Are you sure about this?

37:23.950 --> 37:24.910
No.

37:25.493 --> 37:26.583
Good, you're good.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.656
Now, just keep doing that.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.882
I don't... I don't know if I can do this.

37:35.962 --> 37:36.802
Alex.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.705
You're already doing it.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.635
You're doing it!

37:45.304 --> 37:46.224
Yeah!

37:46.847 --> 37:47.887
You're doing it.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.024
Yeah, boy!

37:49.100 --> 37:50.770
- Whoo!
- Look at him.

37:50.851 --> 37:53.151
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you guys. I'm doing it!

37:54.939 --> 37:55.939
Whoo-hoo!

37:59.318 --> 38:00.648
Whoo!

38:06.492 --> 38:07.412
Yeah!

38:09.870 --> 38:11.460
This is so much fun, you--

38:13.124 --> 38:14.384
- Oh!
- Alex?

38:17.003 --> 38:18.593
- Are you okay?
- Yo, is he dead?

38:18.671 --> 38:19.511
Alex?

38:20.214 --> 38:21.554
- You okay?
- Yo, you good?

38:21.632 --> 38:22.512
You okay?

38:24.802 --> 38:25.642
You okay?

38:28.764 --> 38:29.724
Holy sh...

38:29.807 --> 38:30.927
Yeah, like holy...

38:31.809 --> 38:32.689
shit!

38:42.611 --> 38:43.651
You all right?

38:44.113 --> 38:45.613
Is that where we're going?

39:31.035 --> 39:31.865
There!

39:32.286 --> 39:34.076
Man, this place is trashed.

39:34.830 --> 39:35.660
Looks empty.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.080
Guys, I don't...

39:37.416 --> 39:38.416
Nobody's, uh...

39:40.669 --> 39:41.499
What?

39:42.880 --> 39:45.220
You guys go ahead. I'll just
stay back and watch our bikes.

39:45.299 --> 39:46.219
What?

39:46.675 --> 39:49.505
Oh, yeah, because the aliens
wanna jack our mountain bikes.

39:51.806 --> 39:52.966
Yeah, looters could take them.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.144
Yeah, someone should stay and watch.

39:58.771 --> 39:59.651
Whatever, man.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.856
Hello? Officers?

40:08.989 --> 40:10.779
Shh! What if people are in here?

40:11.033 --> 40:12.283
What do you mean, "shh"?

40:14.870 --> 40:16.790
If I see a clown on a tricycle, I'm out.

40:16.872 --> 40:18.582
- Yes, we should go back.
- No!

40:19.333 --> 40:20.753
We always move forward.

40:21.502 --> 40:22.462
Come on.

40:24.964 --> 40:25.974
Okay, offices.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.054
What? It's a warning.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.312
"Nuclear weapons authorized
for Los Angeles Basin.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.893
Europe destroyed.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.153
Asia... decimated."

40:43.524 --> 40:44.444
Hello?

40:47.361 --> 40:48.361
Hello?

40:52.074 --> 40:53.374
"Primary directive:

40:54.285 --> 40:56.195
locate alien power source."

40:57.872 --> 40:58.832
What?

41:02.418 --> 41:03.378
Anybody?

41:09.008 --> 41:09.878
Hey.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.313
Oh, hey. Don't be scared.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.063
Come on.

41:16.599 --> 41:17.599
Come on.

41:17.683 --> 41:18.643
Hey.

41:19.685 --> 41:20.725
What's your name?

41:22.688 --> 41:23.518
Alex.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.395
My name's Lou.

41:26.775 --> 41:28.145
See those keys right there?

41:29.612 --> 41:31.032
Can you get 'em for me?

41:31.113 --> 41:34.453
Alex, you're not gonna believe what
I just saw, man. It can't get any worse.

41:36.118 --> 41:37.908
Oh, shit! What...

41:37.995 --> 41:41.205
- He wants me to let him go.
- What, you-- Oh, no.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.330
No, that's not going to happen.
Not today. Not at all.

41:43.417 --> 41:44.337
What's going on?

41:44.418 --> 41:47.048
Oh, what? They just evacuate
and leave me in here?

41:47.588 --> 41:50.338
- So whatever it is up there can kill me?
- They're aliens.

41:50.424 --> 41:53.934
And I suggest you keep your mouth
closed when they get up in here, 'cause...

41:54.345 --> 41:55.255
When it...

41:55.346 --> 41:56.636
What'd you do?

41:58.599 --> 41:59.679
I was trying to help.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.441
Yeah, it got a little crazy out there.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.610
Look, Alex, you can stay here
and flirt with Buffalo Bill all day long.

42:05.689 --> 42:09.359
All right? But let's get rid of that
astro-key so someone can stop this thing.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.782
So that key's gonna stop this thing?

42:14.031 --> 42:15.241
Come on, man.

42:15.616 --> 42:19.406
Dariush, it shouldn't be our job
to decide who lives and who dies.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.910
Yeah. But right now it is, Alex.

42:21.997 --> 42:24.327
The police obviously put him
in here for a reason.

42:24.416 --> 42:27.086
All right, and I say...
we respect their decision,

42:27.169 --> 42:28.089
and I'm black!

42:28.170 --> 42:30.130
And he's probably a diddler.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.304
No one deserves to be left in a cage.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.133
Yeah, unless you're a murderer!

42:34.218 --> 42:35.468
I say we let him go.

42:35.761 --> 42:37.601
What do you say, Alex?
You're the final vote.

42:41.517 --> 42:43.307
Okay. Look, I got a boy at home.

42:44.895 --> 42:46.475
And if you leave me in here...

42:48.232 --> 42:49.322
I'm gonna die.

42:50.818 --> 42:53.108
No boy deserves to lose
his dad like that, right?

42:53.654 --> 42:54.534
I mean...

42:54.989 --> 42:56.409
you ready to live with that?

42:58.576 --> 43:00.446
Do you promise not to hurt us?

43:01.120 --> 43:03.120
Yeah, I promise not to hurt you, man.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.720
Wait until we leave.

43:15.092 --> 43:16.142
Then you can go.

43:25.102 --> 43:27.652
How is your watch still working
after the pulse?

43:28.063 --> 43:29.943
It's not electronic, it's mechanical.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.654
- Yo, he's doing good, right?
- Oh.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.110
Yo. Watch out!

43:34.194 --> 43:35.364
It was my dad's.

43:37.114 --> 43:38.994
- He, uh...
- Gave it to you?

43:40.242 --> 43:42.952
- Yeah, he gave it to me.
- Yo!

43:43.037 --> 43:45.037
You got this, Alex. You doing good, man!

43:47.666 --> 43:48.496
Whoa!

43:51.337 --> 43:53.377
Hey! Hey!

43:53.464 --> 43:55.474
- Help!
- Stop!

43:55.549 --> 43:56.969
- Hey!
- Stop!

43:57.051 --> 43:57.891
Hey!

43:57.968 --> 43:59.848
Stay where you are.
Do not move!

44:01.221 --> 44:02.891
Same side. Same side. Same side!

44:04.141 --> 44:05.601
Kids! Kids!

44:07.227 --> 44:09.557
You should've evacuated hours ago.
We're at war.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.067
Sir, we were in the mountains
when the attacks started.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.030
Can you tell us what's going on?
How big is the attack?

44:15.110 --> 44:17.240
Did it reach the nation's finest
Mercedes dealership?

44:17.321 --> 44:19.241
- Dude, how can you...
- My dad owns it.

44:19.323 --> 44:20.623
- I'm the future heir.
- Shut up!

44:20.699 --> 44:22.369
All I can tell you
is you are not safe here.

44:22.451 --> 44:23.951
Everyone on the bus right now.

44:24.036 --> 44:25.576
It'll take you to the evacuation center.

44:25.663 --> 44:26.793
- Let's go!
- Whoa.

44:26.872 --> 44:28.082
- Hey, wait!
- Let's go!

44:28.165 --> 44:29.955
- Knock it off!
- Wait! Hey! Stop!

44:30.042 --> 44:30.882
What?

44:31.043 --> 44:33.053
You need to take this key to Pasadena.

44:34.630 --> 44:35.460
Where'd you get this?

44:35.547 --> 44:37.467
An astronaut from the space station
gave it to us.

44:37.549 --> 44:40.639
- She said we need to take it to JPL.
- What's on that key can stop the aliens.

44:40.719 --> 44:43.759
You need to get that to JPL in Pasadena
to a Dr. Fielding.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.270
We've been receiving Morse code
from a Dr. Fielding at JPL all day.

44:47.351 --> 44:50.401
Finding this key has been
the primary objective. Thanks, kid.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.019
You may have just saved the world.

44:52.731 --> 44:53.771
We'll take it from here.

44:53.857 --> 44:55.687
Okay, we need to go. Move out. Now!

44:55.776 --> 44:58.196
- Yeah.
- Yeah! We did it! Yo, we did--

44:58.278 --> 45:01.278
Yo, I am so happy I told y'all
to go down the hill.

45:02.574 --> 45:03.994
Great job, guys, you did it.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.752
Yeah, we did it. Now move your ass.

45:08.163 --> 45:09.123
Let's go!

45:10.416 --> 45:11.666
- Yo.
- We did it.

45:13.001 --> 45:14.421
Zhenzhen, we did it.

45:14.503 --> 45:16.263
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

45:18.424 --> 45:19.344
Look!

45:21.009 --> 45:21.969
There they go.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.280
Oh, my... Shit!

45:36.358 --> 45:37.608
Alex, are you okay?

45:37.776 --> 45:38.606
Alex!

45:39.862 --> 45:40.742
Get out of here.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.571
- Go!
- Which door is blocked?

45:42.656 --> 45:43.526
Take cover!

45:44.491 --> 45:45.701
Go.

45:45.784 --> 45:46.914
Come on!

45:46.994 --> 45:48.664
- Let's go!
- Move!

45:48.746 --> 45:50.706
Let's go.
We gotta get out of here, man!

45:50.789 --> 45:51.669
Get out of here.

45:52.124 --> 45:53.714
Kick it!

45:53.834 --> 45:56.094
Go! Go, go, go!

45:56.170 --> 45:57.170
Let's go, out!

45:57.296 --> 45:59.166
Go! Oh, shit!

45:59.256 --> 46:00.586
Go the other way.

46:02.342 --> 46:03.592
Watch out for the dogs!

46:06.263 --> 46:07.223
Come on!

46:07.306 --> 46:08.846
Go! Go! Go!

46:09.516 --> 46:10.846
Keep your head down, man!

46:14.021 --> 46:15.611
Holy shit! Oh, no!

46:16.315 --> 46:17.935
- Pick this up with me.
- What are you doing?

46:18.025 --> 46:19.855
- Pick it up with me.
- You gotta get out of here.

46:20.486 --> 46:22.776
- We're gonna get you out!
- Stop, you gotta go.

46:22.863 --> 46:23.953
I can't move it by myself!

46:24.031 --> 46:25.621
You have to go.

46:27.201 --> 46:28.661
Yo, Zhenzhen, get the radio.

46:28.994 --> 46:30.204
Come on, we can't leave you.

46:30.287 --> 46:31.157
Stop. Stop.

46:31.872 --> 46:32.792
It's okay.

46:33.707 --> 46:34.747
It's on you now. Okay?

46:35.542 --> 46:37.002
You have to let me go.

46:37.669 --> 46:39.339
- No, no, I... I can't!
- Shh.

46:39.421 --> 46:40.711
- No!
- Stop!

46:41.173 --> 46:42.883
Take this key. Here, take it.

46:44.134 --> 46:45.144
Promise me.

46:45.219 --> 46:46.219
Promise me...

46:47.054 --> 46:49.394
you will not let anything stop you.

46:49.932 --> 46:50.852
Okay?

46:51.016 --> 46:52.306
Okay, now go. Go!

46:52.684 --> 46:53.854
Now! Move!

46:54.019 --> 46:54.939
Come on!

47:14.122 --> 47:15.002
Oh, shit!

47:15.249 --> 47:17.289
I told you that was a stupid idea.

47:17.417 --> 47:19.037
You idiots almost got me killed.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.958
I don't even wanna be at summer camp.

47:21.046 --> 47:24.006
I should be in Cabo taking jelly shots
off someone's ass cheeks.

47:25.300 --> 47:26.470
Slow down. Slow down.

47:26.552 --> 47:28.642
What do you think these things are after?

47:28.929 --> 47:30.849
Food maybe? Resources?

47:30.931 --> 47:34.101
It's possible their planet went dry
and the came to raid ours.

47:35.310 --> 47:36.440
What gives you that idea?

47:36.770 --> 47:39.360
Nothing! It's the most common
invasion movie plot.

47:39.439 --> 47:40.979
Maybe they're here to find mates.

47:41.066 --> 47:43.986
That would explain the erotic rendezvous
with Dariush earlier.

47:44.069 --> 47:46.149
Hey, whoa. No.
We're not gonna do all that, okay?

47:46.238 --> 47:47.608
That was strictly platonic.

47:48.115 --> 47:50.115
Let's just head north, okay?
To the desert.

47:50.367 --> 47:53.287
Get as far away from that thing
as we can get, all right?

47:53.370 --> 47:56.580
- As far away--
- There is no away from those things.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.290
Zhenzhen's right.

47:58.375 --> 48:01.585
The only way we're going to survive
is if we get this key to Dr. Fielding.

48:01.837 --> 48:04.087
- It's what that soldier was gonna do.
- He died.

48:04.172 --> 48:06.972
Okay, look, if a bunch of bad-ass marines
can't get that key

48:07.050 --> 48:08.680
40 feet away without getting deep fried,

48:09.136 --> 48:11.966
what makes you think
that we can get it 40 miles?

48:13.140 --> 48:14.020
We have to.

48:14.349 --> 48:15.179
What?

48:15.934 --> 48:16.814
It's on us.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.517
Okay. We're not going anywhere
until we get some food.

48:22.858 --> 48:24.528
Maybe even some sleep if we can.

48:25.277 --> 48:26.527
All right, fine.

48:28.030 --> 48:29.240
What's up with Chico?

48:32.951 --> 48:35.121
- It's my street.
- Great!

48:35.537 --> 48:36.577
Can we go in your house?

48:38.248 --> 48:39.708
That's my house, but...

48:42.753 --> 48:43.843
It's not my home.

48:44.796 --> 48:47.256
I haven't been totally honest
with you guys.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.010
I was in the mountains because...

48:51.094 --> 48:52.184
I was in juvie.

48:53.221 --> 48:54.221
And I escaped.

48:58.435 --> 48:59.975
So even if my mom is here...

49:01.897 --> 49:03.397
she's not gonna wanna see me.

49:12.741 --> 49:13.911
Come on, man.

49:21.541 --> 49:22.541
Go, go, jump left!

49:27.673 --> 49:29.053
- No!
- What the hell was that?

49:29.132 --> 49:30.762
- Run!
- Where do we go? Follow me.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.472
Oh, damn!

49:37.099 --> 49:38.889
Man, we need to get my man Jacobi
up in here.

49:39.267 --> 49:40.347
It's looters.

49:42.104 --> 49:44.024
All right,
let's find something to eat.

49:44.106 --> 49:47.146
Man, I need a T-bone steak,
some cheese eggs and Welch's grape.

49:49.361 --> 49:50.611
I shouldn't have hit you.

49:50.946 --> 49:51.816
It was my fault.

49:52.364 --> 49:54.534
I don't know. I'm good, bro. I mean...

49:54.825 --> 49:57.945
it doesn't hurt as much
as seeing all this gunk on my new J's.

49:58.745 --> 50:01.155
How do you care about sneakers
in a time like this?

50:01.915 --> 50:03.625
You know what? You guys are lucky.

50:04.334 --> 50:05.294
You don't have friends.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.707
It's hard out here for a pimp,
you know?

50:07.796 --> 50:10.626
Gotta keep up with the flyest shit,
you know, the dopest kicks.

50:10.716 --> 50:12.506
Tightest whip. Baddest chick.

50:12.592 --> 50:15.262
And my friends, they're like bears.
Soon as they smell weakness,

50:15.345 --> 50:17.255
they're just coming straight at your neck.

50:17.639 --> 50:20.059
That's why I keep this on my neck.
Diamonds.

50:20.142 --> 50:22.602
Does Dariush mean "douchebag" in Farsi?

50:23.937 --> 50:24.807
What's Farsi?

50:24.896 --> 50:26.436
It's the language your mom was screaming

50:26.523 --> 50:28.363
when you were coming out of her ass.

50:28.859 --> 50:30.989
Hey, don't talk about my mom's ass.
All right.

50:31.069 --> 50:32.279
You wish you were there.

50:32.362 --> 50:34.362
No offense, dude,
those don't sound like friends.

50:34.448 --> 50:35.318
Yeah...

50:49.129 --> 50:51.299
Hey, how did you even end up in jail?

50:56.803 --> 50:59.143
My dad left when... when I was about ten.

51:00.140 --> 51:03.850
You know, I got a job as a bag boy,
at a grocery store my mom worked at.

51:04.019 --> 51:06.059
To, you know... help her with money.

51:07.147 --> 51:09.937
One time she steps away,
I took over the cash register.

51:14.613 --> 51:15.783
I was helping a customer,

51:16.364 --> 51:19.414
and, uh, he started to accuse me
of stealing from him.

51:21.119 --> 51:23.159
I guess I gave him the wrong change.

51:26.708 --> 51:27.788
I get numbers...

51:28.168 --> 51:30.128
like, muddled in my head sometimes,

51:30.462 --> 51:32.052
unless I see them written down.

51:33.173 --> 51:34.423
But he didn't believe me.

51:34.758 --> 51:35.588
And, um...

51:35.675 --> 51:36.545
I just...

51:38.011 --> 51:38.891
I lost it.

51:38.970 --> 51:40.140
So I decked him.

51:40.680 --> 51:41.560
Broke his nose.

51:43.934 --> 51:45.194
Mom got fired and...

51:46.394 --> 51:47.604
they sent me away.

51:48.438 --> 51:50.398
She never came around to visit me once.

51:53.193 --> 51:54.653
You can't choose your family.

51:56.113 --> 51:57.863
But you can always make a new one.

52:03.120 --> 52:03.950
Come on.

52:04.037 --> 52:05.327
A young Yoda up in here?

52:06.665 --> 52:09.495
- Come on, guys.
- Oh, we're taking an old school selfie?

52:09.876 --> 52:11.626
One, two, three.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.670
- Dude, stop playing with the Rubik's cube.
- I can't, okay! I can't!

52:15.757 --> 52:18.297
We can all agree
that she gets her own bed, right?

52:18.385 --> 52:20.715
Well, yeah, obviously.
It's the only gentlemanly thing to do.

52:20.804 --> 52:22.354
It's only right. It sounds like a plan.

52:26.268 --> 52:27.808
One of you can sleep with me.

52:33.316 --> 52:34.856
Hold it. Hold it. Wait, wait!

52:34.943 --> 52:36.823
Did she just say one of us
could sleep with her?

52:36.903 --> 52:38.283
- Maybe we misheard her.
- Okay, look.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.493
I will volunteer my services
for the good of the group,

52:40.574 --> 52:42.204
and because I've had the most experience.

52:42.284 --> 52:43.334
With what? Not getting any?

52:43.410 --> 52:46.450
Hey, it's better than eating Lithuanian
smoothies from your bunk mate in juvie.

52:46.538 --> 52:48.328
- Lithuanian smoothies?
- You don't need to know.

52:48.415 --> 52:50.415
How about we get Alex and Zhenzhen
to sleep together?

52:50.500 --> 52:52.880
- Because he doesn't want to.
- I wouldn't say I don't want to.

52:52.961 --> 52:54.711
- They have a connection!
- We do?

52:54.880 --> 52:56.210
So don't be a cock-block.

52:57.132 --> 52:59.262
Fine, fine. All right. Okay, cool.

52:59.509 --> 53:00.719
I won't block your cock.

53:01.136 --> 53:02.006
Be free.

53:03.763 --> 53:04.603
Thanks.

53:05.056 --> 53:06.016
It's no problem.

53:09.769 --> 53:13.149
Ah, crap! I forgot my sleep apnea mask.
If I snore, I'm sorry.

53:13.231 --> 53:14.481
You have sleep apnea?

53:14.649 --> 53:15.729
How old are you?

53:15.817 --> 53:17.897
It's non-age-discriminate, Gabriel!

53:19.446 --> 53:20.736
Just move over.

53:47.140 --> 53:48.390
I'm glad it was you.

54:20.090 --> 54:22.090
Shh! Shh! Shh! Aliens...

54:22.175 --> 54:23.085
Yeah.

54:23.593 --> 54:24.553
We gotta go.

54:28.932 --> 54:29.812
You see anything?

54:31.268 --> 54:32.098
No, come on.

54:49.119 --> 54:50.449
Guys, we should turn back.

54:50.912 --> 54:52.832
We can't now, man. We're already here.

54:52.914 --> 54:55.584
Dude, I'm telling you,
this is how people die in movies.

55:00.964 --> 55:02.974
Guys. You see anything?

55:05.176 --> 55:07.216
You need some Frebreze on these sheets.

55:07.929 --> 55:09.179
Ah! Oh! Oh!

55:10.807 --> 55:12.517
Oh, shit!

55:12.600 --> 55:14.190
Not another step.

55:14.769 --> 55:16.099
- Move!
- I'm backing up.

55:16.187 --> 55:18.977
The hell you doing out here?
We're in the middle of an alien invasion.

55:19.065 --> 55:21.895
Oh, yeah, I mean, and you're the ones
with the Purge masks.

55:21.985 --> 55:23.855
- Wrong genre, bro.
- We got a comedian here.

55:23.945 --> 55:25.065
No!

55:25.155 --> 55:26.405
There are aliens out here, okay?

55:26.489 --> 55:27.659
We're not the enemy.

55:27.741 --> 55:29.451
You guys have something we're looking for.

55:29.909 --> 55:30.829
Dignity?

55:32.495 --> 55:33.825
What'd you say?

55:34.914 --> 55:37.254
Everybody calm down.

55:40.420 --> 55:42.300
Look what we found.

55:50.847 --> 55:51.717
Lou!

55:52.349 --> 55:54.019
- Oh my God, Lou!
- Thank you, Baby Jesus.

55:54.100 --> 55:55.560
- Thank you, God!
- Lou.

55:55.643 --> 55:57.653
- Thank God!
- Hold on, you know this guy?

55:57.729 --> 55:58.859
No. No, no, no, no.

55:58.938 --> 56:00.768
Do we know him? Hell, yeah we know him!

56:00.857 --> 56:04.277
- Yes! Yes!
- We go way back. Lou, my negro!

56:04.361 --> 56:06.451
Lou, you know me. We're like this.

56:06.529 --> 56:09.449
I wanted to free... Alex was the one
who was like, "Leave him in there,"

56:09.532 --> 56:11.832
and I was like,
"Dude, let's free him. He's a human."

56:11.910 --> 56:15.370
Do you mind, if you could just tell
these handsome men, the ones...

56:15.538 --> 56:17.828
pointing the shotguns at our face,
to, you know...

56:18.208 --> 56:20.288
not... not do that?

56:21.002 --> 56:22.002
- Please?
- Please.

56:26.549 --> 56:27.379
Please.

56:28.468 --> 56:30.598
I don't think anyone needs
to get hurt tonight.

56:32.722 --> 56:33.562
But Alex...

56:33.640 --> 56:36.890
if you'd be so kind as to give me that?

56:39.479 --> 56:40.399
This?

56:41.189 --> 56:42.019
Yeah.

56:43.608 --> 56:46.068
This is our only shot
at defeating the aliens.

56:46.444 --> 56:47.494
Yeah.

56:48.696 --> 56:51.236
That means someone
will pay a lot of money for it.

56:54.994 --> 56:55.954
Give me...

56:56.955 --> 56:58.035
the key.

57:02.377 --> 57:03.287
I can't.

57:07.132 --> 57:08.302
I made a promise.

57:08.466 --> 57:10.546
Alex, give him the key. Enough. Okay?

57:10.718 --> 57:12.178
You can give me the key

57:12.429 --> 57:13.719
and just walk away.

57:15.682 --> 57:18.812
Or I can cut your head off
and take the key from the stump.

57:21.146 --> 57:22.356
I trusted you.

57:22.856 --> 57:25.476
The cemeteries are full of people
who trusted me.

57:25.567 --> 57:26.437
Oh, shit!

57:36.578 --> 57:37.998
Oh, sh--

57:40.707 --> 57:42.077
- Hurry!
- Run!

57:44.919 --> 57:45.799
Come on!

58:03.855 --> 58:05.565
- Gabriel!
- Gabriel!

58:05.690 --> 58:07.110
Gabriel, what are you doing?

58:07.192 --> 58:08.572
Zhenzhen, throw me the glow sticks.

58:08.651 --> 58:10.201
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

58:10.278 --> 58:11.528
- Gabriel, hurry up!
- Over here.

58:11.613 --> 58:13.413
- Throw 'em! Come on!
- Come here.

58:17.076 --> 58:18.156
What are you doing?

58:18.369 --> 58:19.249
Hey!

58:22.373 --> 58:23.213
Come here!

58:23.625 --> 58:25.835
- Gabriel, hurry up!
- Come here, you're gonna die!

58:25.919 --> 58:27.549
- Get over here!
- Hurry!

58:27.629 --> 58:29.629
Hurry up, Gabriel! Come on!

58:29.714 --> 58:31.014
Get him, get him, get him!

58:32.008 --> 58:33.838
- Come on! Come get me!
- Gabriel!

58:33.927 --> 58:34.757
Gabriel!

58:36.721 --> 58:37.851
- Hurry up!
- Gabriel, come on!

58:37.931 --> 58:38.851
Go! Hurry!

58:39.349 --> 58:40.269
Gabriel, come on!

58:47.565 --> 58:49.065
Get out, Gabriel!

58:55.156 --> 58:56.736
Oh, shit, it worked, Gabriel!

58:57.075 --> 58:58.485
- Oh, my God.
- It worked.

58:58.618 --> 58:59.488
Go! Go!

59:14.342 --> 59:17.642
That was the same alien from camp.
I thought we killed that thing.

59:19.138 --> 59:20.558
If it came down with the capsule,

59:20.640 --> 59:22.980
that means it survived the heat
of atmospheric re-entry

59:23.059 --> 59:25.809
Which means it must have tremendous
cellular regeneration abilities.

59:25.895 --> 59:28.145
English, Alex, please.

59:28.523 --> 59:29.773
It's like Wolverine.

59:29.941 --> 59:30.781
Oh.

59:31.192 --> 59:32.862
Why the hell is the following us?

59:32.944 --> 59:34.364
It's pissed about its dog.

59:34.445 --> 59:36.565
You ever watch Marley and Me
or Beethoven?

59:36.656 --> 59:37.986
It's a primal bond.

59:38.116 --> 59:39.986
It's out for revenge. Ask John Wick.

59:40.076 --> 59:42.576
You're putting human motives
on an alien lifeform.

59:42.662 --> 59:44.792
No, it probably just had orders
to kill Collins

59:44.872 --> 59:47.792
and anyone she came in contact with.
We're just loose ends to this thing.

59:47.875 --> 59:51.585
- No, you know what, dog theory was better.
- Who gives a frog's fat ass why?

59:51.879 --> 59:53.259
This ain't Comic-Con, bitches.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.301
All that matters is that it wants us dead.

59:57.802 --> 59:59.262
And we can't kill it.

01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:02.678
She's right. We should just keep moving.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.234
I'm done with your ideas.

01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:07.519
You were the one who thought
to let Hannibal Lecter out of his cell.

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:09.937
Consider your leadership privileges...

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:10.863
revoked!

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.860
Sometimes you do the right thing
and it doesn't work out.

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:16.069
That doesn't mean it wasn't worth doing.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.280
Who the hell told you that?

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:19.244
My dad.

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:22.451
Never knew what it meant until right now.

01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:27.706
Look, why is it up to us to save humanity?

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:31.040
What, do you think someone else
should do it? Of course you do.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:33.707
The kid who's always
had everything done for him.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.876
Maybe Mommy and Daddy
can pay the alien to go away,

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.005
buy him a new Mercedes--

01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:39.391
Hey! You don't know my family, dude.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:42.848
That's enough!

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:44.676
That's enough!

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:48.136
You don't know me. My family has nothing!

01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:50.977
Oh, yeah? Except for a car dealership
and a mansion and a yacht!

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.774
No, the dealership is gone.

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:55.355
It's all gone.

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:57.949
That's why they sent me to camp, man.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.067
It's...

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:01.615
It's just stuff.

01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:04.079
I don't know who I am
without all that stuff.

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:09.369
And... they're taking my dad.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:12.878
He's going to jail.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.880
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:22.894
Ah, here we go.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:28.602
I'm sorry I head-butted you.
You should clean that up.

01:01:28.893 --> 01:01:31.443
Yeah, that's fine.
Sorry for... punching you.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.358
It's Dr. Fielding.

01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:35.269
He's trying to contact us. We gotta go.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.358
Maybe we should try to find some clothes?

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:39.613
No clue what that thing can track,
it might be our scent.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:40.656
Then let's go.

01:01:59.006 --> 01:02:00.966
I hope they got
a McDonald's in here,

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.430
I need me, like, two McDoubles
and an ice cream.

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:05.221
Hurry, come on.
Gotta get inside.

01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:07.854
Come on.
I know Gucci's downstairs, let's go.

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.228
Yo. You guys...

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:20.701
How do you think an alien
would do against this?

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.869
The circle is complete!

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:26.579
I am your master now.

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:29.119
No, the line is,

01:02:29.203 --> 01:02:32.583
"The circle is now complete.
Now I am the master."

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:35.246
Okay, we really need to get you a girl.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:38.054
Gotta cut this shit out. You know
too much about this Star Trek shit.

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:39.799
- Guys!
- It's Star Wars.

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:45.086
It's time for a change.

01:02:57.523 --> 01:02:58.523
Sorry.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.610
It's okay.

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.743
That pamphlet must mean a lot to you.

01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:08.994
For you to bring it all the way here.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:14.793
I didn't bring it here.

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.173
It brought me.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.007
Well then, why did you leave home?

01:03:24.008 --> 01:03:26.008
Let's just say dad wanted a boy.

01:03:36.437 --> 01:03:37.727
Zhenzhen, what are you doing?

01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:40.106
That's what brought you here.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:42.356
Yeah, but...

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.111
this is why I'm staying.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:53.869
Let it go, man.

01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:29.565
It's on top of the roof!

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:34.202
Hang on!

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.711
Oh, shit, where's it at?

01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:50.165
- It's gone. Gimme some.
- Whoo!

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:51.296
- Oh, it's gone!
- Yes!

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:53.927
Oh! Oh!

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:11.402
- Jump!
- What?

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:13.701
Are you crazy?

01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:15.029
Jump! Jump!

01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:16.164
Jump!

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.052
Way to go, Zhenzhen!

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.380
Is everyone okay?

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.176
Yeah, I think so.

01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:43.181
Guys. Guys! I don't have the key.

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:44.937
- What?
- It's probably in the car.

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:47.022
- We need that key.
- Ah!

01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:55.452
Damn it.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.120
- Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
- Where you going?

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:00.278
To get the key.

01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:02.697
No way we can kill that thing,
it's just gonna reanimate.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:06.117
Yeah, but...
but we need that key to finish this off.

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:09.457
- You're gonna die if you go down there.
- She's right, we'll go together.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:11.666
So all four of us can die?

01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:13.884
I thought you were supposed
to be the smart one.

01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:17.721
It's my turn.

01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:19.096
Look, man...

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:26.019
Did you know I was named
after the ancient King of Persia, Darius?

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.229
Well, do you know who Darius's
greatest rival ever was,

01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:32.982
the only one to ever defeat him?

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:36.243
- Alexander the Great.
- Yeah.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.238
Yeah, I knew you'd know that.

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:41.328
Well, look...

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:44.042
this time...

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.671
Darius gets to be the hero.

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:55.761
Good luck.

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:01.985
Come on!

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:08.407
Oh, shit.

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:15.538
Oh, I got it. I got it!

01:10:27.848 --> 01:10:28.718
I got it.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.845
- Yeah! Yes!
- Yes.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:33.306
I got the key.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.476
Hey, behind you!

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.404
What?

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:38.113
I got it.

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:39.652
- No!
- Dariush, behind you!

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:40.895
- Turn around!
- No!

01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:52.498
We gotta go.

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:58.459
Come on, Dariush!

01:10:58.545 --> 01:10:59.375
Go, run!

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:01.383
- Look out!
- We gotta go!

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:05.966
Come on. You okay?

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.055
- That cut looks terrible.
- I'm okay, I'm all right.

01:11:08.138 --> 01:11:10.098
Let's just get this key to JPL.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.819
That was really cool driving back there.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.453
I couldn't have done that.

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.452
You don't give yourself enough credit.

01:11:30.202 --> 01:11:32.252
I'm told girls find bravery attractive.

01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:34.788
I've never really had much of that.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:43.758
My whole life
I have been searching for love.

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:45.471
When I saw you on the bridge...

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.930
I knew you were the one.

01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:52.055
If you feel the same way...

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.653
kiss me now
and we will be together forever.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.900
I'm sorry, my Mandarin is rudimentary.

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:04.816
Hmm?

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:08.407
What did you say?

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:11.575
What did you say?

01:12:12.369 --> 01:12:14.369
Zhenzhen, I don't actually speak Mandarin.

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:17.165
- What did you say?
- Yo, look! Look, JPL.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:18.920
- What?
- Whoa!

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.211
- Let's go.
- Come on!

01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:26.377
- Man, this place got hit hard.
- The building is destroyed.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:27.677
Nobody can survive that.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.930
He's still here.

01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:31.932
Dr. Fielding's still here!

01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:33.386
This way!

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:35.144
If we get out of this alive,

01:12:35.225 --> 01:12:36.845
NASA's paying for my therapy.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.653
Oh, wow.

01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:40.362
They're testing plasma rockets.

01:12:41.106 --> 01:12:43.356
Those things burn hotter
than the surface of the Sun.

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:45.442
Look, all we gotta do
is get this key to Dr. Fielding

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.487
then you can look at all
the nerd porn you want.

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.912
Dr. Fielding! Dr. Fielding!

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:54.497
We have the key, sir.

01:12:54.578 --> 01:12:55.908
Dr. Fielding, we have the key.

01:12:55.996 --> 01:12:57.616
- Dr. Fielding.
- Dr. Fielding.

01:12:58.415 --> 01:13:00.665
- Dr. Fielding!
- We have the key, sir!

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:01.918
Over here.

01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:02.842
Guys!

01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:05.672
- Go, go, go!
- Dr. Fielding.

01:13:15.265 --> 01:13:16.225
He's dead, guys.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:20.850
But how?

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:36.414
Shoot!

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:37.365
We've failed.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:40.535
It's over.

01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:48.761
I mean...

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.388
let's be honest, guys.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.470
Who do we think we are?

01:13:57.349 --> 01:13:58.229
Nerd.

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:00.441
Criminal.

01:14:01.061 --> 01:14:01.901
Orphan.

01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:03.559
A joke.

01:14:08.068 --> 01:14:09.188
I guess I'll...

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:11.574
go try and find my parents.

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.950
Me too.

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:35.101
What are you doing?

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:54.816
Look.

01:14:55.532 --> 01:14:57.122
They didn't even get to open this.

01:14:58.118 --> 01:15:01.578
Well, since we're all gonna die together,
may I propose a toast?

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:05.293
Oh, crap. This is from 1969!

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:09.304
I mean, could at least get some fresh wine
if this is gonna be my first time, right?

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:15.137
Citadel, this is Crystal Palace.

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:17.219
- What? What was that?
- Go! What the heck?

01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:18.429
Citadel...

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:20.814
- Hello?
- ...this is Crystal Palace. Do you copy?

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:22.351
We're here, over!

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:24.064
Citadel, identify yourself.

01:15:24.144 --> 01:15:26.404
What is your name, ma'am? Over!

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.560
I'm Alex.

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:28.648
How old are you?

01:15:28.732 --> 01:15:29.692
I'm thirteen.

01:15:30.108 --> 01:15:32.568
And if you don't mind me asking,
who are we talking to?

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:35.534
This is General George Khoury
at Cheyenne Mountain.

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:37.486
Is anyone alive at JPL?

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:38.994
Is Dr. Fielding there?

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:41.366
There are four of us,
everyone else is dead.

01:15:41.453 --> 01:15:43.753
The astronaut sent us, before she died.

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.620
You were sent by Major Collins?

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:46.787
Yeah, that's why we came.

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:49.165
She gave us the key
and said something about Excalibur.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:51.423
What, you have the crypto-key
in your possession?

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:53.875
That's right. What do we need to do
to get it to work?

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:56.836
Nothing.

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:58.966
You need to get out of there.

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.604
I'm... I'm sorry. It's over.

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:04.522
There's nothing you kids
can do against this thing.

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:08.400
Now get out of there immediately,
we're sending two units to pick you--

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.310
No.

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:13.236
- What did you say, son?
- I said no.

01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:16.282
I made a promise
I wouldn't let anything stop me.

01:16:16.613 --> 01:16:18.823
So I'm gonna keep trying
and it will be a lot easier

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.077
if you would help me.

01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:22.198
We didn't come all this way
to give up now.

01:16:23.036 --> 01:16:25.576
We're done being told
what we can and can't do.

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:28.504
We made it across
half of southern California.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.714
- Past aliens and soldiers.
- A diddler!

01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:32.004
Don't forget about the diddler.

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:33.257
All the way here.

01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:35.167
Nobody helped us get here.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.837
All we had was each other.

01:16:37.884 --> 01:16:40.304
So you're gonna listen to me,
because we're not kids anymore,

01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:41.847
and we're the best chance you've got.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:45.431
I'm going to ask you
one more time, General.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:48.346
What do we need to do
to get this thing working?

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.650
All right, someone needs to go down
to the basement and fire up

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.034
the emergency generators.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.860
Start them in sequence,

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:59.105
exactly four seconds apart.

01:16:59.197 --> 01:17:00.987
Send your fastest, strongest--

01:17:01.074 --> 01:17:02.124
I'll do it!

01:17:02.659 --> 01:17:05.119
I'm sorry, that sounded like a young girl.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:08.214
Oh, yeah!
Aliens don't stand a chance against her.

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:11.344
All right!
You need to climb through the vent.

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:15.008
The vault door won't open
until the power is back on.

01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:16.338
- Got it.
- Look...

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.175
You're not safe at JPL.

01:17:18.717 --> 01:17:20.837
- Did you hear the four seconds part?
- Yeah.

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:23.715
If this doesn't work,
I need to make sure...

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.385
You're gonna need to time it.

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:29.136
Take care of it.

01:17:31.563 --> 01:17:32.523
And yourself.

01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:39.986
Your father would be proud.

01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:51.246
What are we doing? What is Excalibur?

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:54.003
Excalibur was a Cold War defense project.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.666
It was meant to shoot down

01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:56.804
Russian missiles.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.680
Yeah, using fusion pumped X-ray lasers,
I read about that.

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:02.338
Never mind him. He knows everything.
Keep going.

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:04.597
The key that Major Collins gave you

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.390
contains the coordinates
of the alien mothership in high orbit.

01:18:09.142 --> 01:18:10.562
We can destroy the mothership.

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:12.563
You're our last hope.

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:16.272
Okay, what else do we need to do
to get this shit started?

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:19.108
You need to realign the satellite dish
on the roof,

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:20.654
then get a working computer

01:18:20.737 --> 01:18:23.657
and load the coordinates
Major Collins gave you.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:25.776
Then activate Excalibur.

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:28.037
- All right, I'll go to the roof.
- No, Gabriel.

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:33.794
You guys load the programs.
I'm gonna go to the roof.

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.916
Plus you're hurt
and he's the only one keeping you alive.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.764
What are you talking about?
You're afraid of heights!

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.471
I'm scared of everything.

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:44.507
It's my turn.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.472
Tell Zhenzhen,
I'm gonna want my watch back.

01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:53.559
And if I die...

01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:56.572
tell her I love her.

01:19:01.194 --> 01:19:04.454
Actually, wait... don't tell her
I love her, just tell her I was into her.

01:19:04.531 --> 01:19:06.411
I don't want to freak her out
with the "L" word.

01:19:06.491 --> 01:19:07.581
Just go!

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:35.099
Ow!

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:05.509
Switches...

01:20:22.275 --> 01:20:24.065
Oh, my God. That's tall.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.293
Don't look down.

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:41.592
Don't look down.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:42.800
Don't look down.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:45.336
Don't look down.

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.114
Switches.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.236
Four, three,

01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:11.236
two, one.

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:16.579
Four, three, two, one.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:22.093
Four, three, two, one.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.800
Shit, she actually got the power back on.

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:30.844
Yes! Okay.

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:34.059
Good. Do you see the monitors
at the back of the room?

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:35.809
Are the control stations working?

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:40.187
Yeah. Yeah!

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:41.810
- The computers are working.
- Excellent.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.977
- It's on.
- Now insert the crypto-key.

01:21:45.650 --> 01:21:47.400
I got it. I got it!

01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:50.697
Okay, did your friend move the dish yet?

01:21:50.947 --> 01:21:51.987
Uh...

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:54.529
No, I see him but he hasn't moved it yet.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:57.698
Then you have to wait
before you launch Excalibur.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:01.922
Don't look down.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:03.749
You can do this.

01:22:09.382 --> 01:22:10.302
Shit!

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:12.006
- Alex!
- Alex!

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:14.050
- Alex!
- Activate the PA system.

01:22:14.137 --> 01:22:15.557
- Alex!
- Alex!

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:18.268
- Alex!
- God?

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:19.310
Behind you, look down!

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:21.646
- Go, hurry, Alex!
- Oh, God!

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.456
- Oh, he did it!
- God!

01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:03.018
Yeah!

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.522
Ah!

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:24.577
No...

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.580
No!

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:30.048
No!

01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:35.755
Son, Excalibur needs two people
to launch it.

01:23:36.302 --> 01:23:37.392
Shit, he passed out.

01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:38.510
Hey, get up! Get up!

01:23:38.596 --> 01:23:41.346
One of your other friends
is going to have to help you.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:42.853
Where are they?

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:45.230
I don't know.

01:24:00.577 --> 01:24:01.447
Alex! Zhenzhen!

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:04.116
Dariush is in bad shape
and I can't do this alone.

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:19.802
Get the two launch keys
from the safe locker.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:22.928
Let me know when you're there
and I'll give you the code.

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:26.807
Oh, no!

01:24:27.437 --> 01:24:28.647
F... F...

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:29.982
Okay.

01:24:30.523 --> 01:24:31.443
Punch in...

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:34.565
nine, six, three, two, two,

01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:36.152
one, zero, three.

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:37.987
Tell me when you've got it open.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:38.993
Uh...

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:41.155
No.

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:44.792
I said, nine, six, three, two, two,

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:46.621
one, zero, three.

01:24:48.708 --> 01:24:49.538
Fuck!

01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:52.586
The code, nine, six, three, one...

01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:00.352
- No, no, no!
- Gabriel.

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:02.806
I wrote it down for you.

01:25:03.389 --> 01:25:04.389
I got you, brother.

01:25:04.849 --> 01:25:07.189
- Oh, my God. Thanks. Thank you.
- Hurry up.

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:10.519
Okay. Okay. Three, two, two, one...

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.565
Okay!

01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:14.026
I got 'em! I got 'em!

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:19.109
It is imperative that they are inserted
at the same time.

01:25:19.697 --> 01:25:21.067
Oh, shit, he passed out again.

01:25:21.157 --> 01:25:22.197
Dariush. Hey.

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:24.373
We are running out of time, son!

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.042
Hey, wake up. Wake up!

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:28.081
We are running out of time, son!

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:31.673
I can't. I can't!

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:32.883
- Gabriel!
- Zhenzhen!

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.501
Come on, we gotta do this!

01:25:34.587 --> 01:25:36.167
- What do we do?
- Right here, okay.

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:37.416
- Right here?
- Yeah.

01:25:38.007 --> 01:25:39.337
On my mark, okay?

01:25:39.425 --> 01:25:42.295
Three, two, one.

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:01.241
Come at me, bitch!

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:03.198
Come get me, mother...

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:05.033
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:07.788
- You can't kill that with a flare gun.
- No. But I know what can.

01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:09.621
Launch Excalibur, then meet me outside.

01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:12.671
Ah!

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:17.085
- Oh, shit, we gotta go! Come on.
- Come on. Go!

01:26:17.213 --> 01:26:19.383
- We gotta try this again. Ready?
- Try this again.

01:26:19.924 --> 01:26:21.344
We gotta put an end to this, okay?

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:23.846
Three, two, one, go!

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:49.288
Oh, yes!

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:50.960
- We did it!
- Yes!

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:53.458
Now, get out of there immediately.

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:57.001
We're sending two units to pick you up.
The building is not safe.

01:26:57.086 --> 01:26:57.996
Yeah!

01:26:58.087 --> 01:26:59.127
Yes!

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:02.718
Come on.

01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:07.059
Come get me!

01:27:21.152 --> 01:27:23.202
Warning!

01:27:23.279 --> 01:27:24.859
Warning!

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:26.953
Warning!

No, hey. It's too dangerous.

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:16.209
But I have to get him.

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:18.461
- It's too late.
- Alex!

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.051
No! No!

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:30.556
Alex, come on!

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.890
- Come on!
- I can't.

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.853
- Alex, you can.
- No, I can't!

01:28:33.933 --> 01:28:36.063
- Alex!
- No, Dad!

01:28:38.354 --> 01:28:39.314
Go!

01:28:42.358 --> 01:28:44.238
- You have to let go.
- I'm not gonna leave.

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:47.239
- Alex, you have to let go.
- No, stop!

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.162
No!

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:51.027
- Don't be afraid.
- No!

01:29:04.255 --> 01:29:05.665
Alex, don't be afraid.

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:07.838
It's okay.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:10.644
You can do this.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.924
Alex. Please. Please.

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.076
Alex.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.840
Alex!

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:25.799
Oh, my God!

01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:26.923
Yeah!

01:30:27.338 --> 01:30:28.968
Alex!

01:30:29.465 --> 01:30:30.465
Oh, my God!

01:30:32.009 --> 01:30:33.009
Oh, my God!

01:30:33.719 --> 01:30:35.469
Dude, I missed you so much.

01:30:38.141 --> 01:30:39.771
Did we do it? Did we do it?

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:43.186
Whoa!

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.860
Guys, we did it.

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:50.033
Hell, yeah, we did it.

01:30:50.987 --> 01:30:53.317
- Whoo! Yeah.
- Oh, man!

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:54.411
Oh, my God.

01:30:55.992 --> 01:30:56.832
Yeah!

01:31:01.247 --> 01:31:03.457
I guess you're pretty brave after all.

01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:07.799
You really think so?

01:31:37.825 --> 01:31:40.905
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely
coming back next year, for sure.

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:42.785
We saved the world!
