WEBVTT

00:09.583 --> 00:10.625
Suction.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.291
More suction.

00:16.375 --> 00:17.583
You okay, kiddo?

00:17.667 --> 00:19.083
Is he going to make it, Dad?

00:19.166 --> 00:22.417
Just as soon as I finish
cross clamping this aorta.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.917
Boy's not much older than you.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.250
Does he need more blood?
I can give.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.792
Nope. 'Cause
that
just about does
it.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.417
- 'Need a hand.'
- What's going on?

00:30.500 --> 00:33.083
55-year-old, needs a stent,
angioplasty.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.500
Alright, close up.

00:34.583 --> 00:36.250
I'll see what's what.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.959
- Talk to Mom?
- Yeah.

00:43.041 --> 00:44.417
Got through all her blue books.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.583
She give out any A's?

00:45.667 --> 00:47.250
- No.
- 'Grant!'

00:53.208 --> 00:54.625
(male #1)
'He's in repack, Seth.'

00:54.709 --> 00:56.375
Better get a perfusing
rhythm before sending him

00:56.458 --> 00:57.625
up to the cath lab.

00:58.959 --> 01:02.250
Paddles. Charge 200.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.583
'Clear.'

01:06.500 --> 01:07.750
'Charge.'

01:07.834 --> 01:09.667
Clear.

01:18.875 --> 01:20.208
Your dad's got the touch.

01:20.291 --> 01:21.959
- Yeah?
- Doesn't miss a trick.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.250
Raises 'em from the dead.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.667
(Grant)
'Don't believe it, Jase.'

01:24.750 --> 01:27.667
I'm just a glorified
electrician around here.

01:27.750 --> 01:31.000
Okay, let's send Mr. Lee
up to the cath lab.

01:31.083 --> 01:34.458
Let me through. I want
to see my husband,
please.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.000
My husband, Tong Lee..

01:38.083 --> 01:39.208
...is he going to be alright?

01:39.291 --> 01:40.583
Yes, he's stable, ma'am.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.542
Oh, thank God.

01:42.625 --> 01:46.083
Thank you. Oh, we-we can pay.

01:46.166 --> 01:47.500
We have money. Cash.

01:47.583 --> 01:50.208
Just think about
your husband right now. Okay?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.083
Is that a squirrel?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.500
Japanese crane.

02:48.583 --> 02:49.917
Looks like a squirrel.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.542
(John)
'Hey, Nick.'

02:55.375 --> 02:57.041
Nick Vera, this is David Cage.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.458
You're the new ADA,
replaced Danner?

02:58.542 --> 03:01.250
Yes. But trying
to live that down.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.583
I'm here to mend fences.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.125
This is Edwina Davis

03:05.208 --> 03:07.041
just came forward
with new information.

03:07.125 --> 03:10.208
Miss Davis witnessed the murder
of Dr. Grant Bowen back in '84.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.959
Call me Edie.

03:12.041 --> 03:12.917
Okay.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.417
I was on the streets
back then.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.834
Scared of cops.
But all that's changed.

03:16.917 --> 03:19.250
- 'Making amends.'
- Tell us what you saw?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.917
The man that got shot,
the doctor

03:21.000 --> 03:23.750
he was walking and talking
to a white guy.

03:23.834 --> 03:27.000
The guy who was arrested
for the killing was black.

03:27.083 --> 03:29.250
Homeless, history
of mental illness.

03:29.333 --> 03:30.792
You see this white guy
shoot the doc?

03:30.875 --> 03:32.875
Right in the heart.

03:32.959 --> 03:34.542
You hear anything
they were saying?

03:34.625 --> 03:38.000
No. But I think your
shooter
might've been another
doc.

03:38.083 --> 03:39.000
Why's that?

03:39.083 --> 03:40.375
'Because he had a cap'

03:40.458 --> 03:41.917
with the hospital logo
on it, you know

03:42.000 --> 03:43.125
'with the hands.'

03:43.208 --> 03:44.750
Anything else
you can remember, Edie?

03:44.834 --> 03:46.417
No.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.417
But I could use a soda.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.208
Sure. Come on.

03:59.959 --> 04:01.750
- So?
- Good new direction.

04:01.834 --> 04:05.166
I'm glad. Like I said,
trying to reach out.

04:06.542 --> 04:09.125
If we take this job,
I'd like to get my
detective

04:09.208 --> 04:10.500
'off desk duty.'

04:10.583 --> 04:13.375
- The one who clocked Danner?
- Will Jeffries.

04:13.458 --> 04:17.041
Up to my boss
to drop those charges, not me.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.375
You puttin' a good word
in couldn't hurt.

04:19.458 --> 04:20.709
That's true.

04:20.792 --> 04:22.333
I could make a call.

04:22.417 --> 04:23.667
Could?

04:24.875 --> 04:25.917
Will.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.083
(Kat)
'Just don't take her there.'

05:01.166 --> 05:02.667
- 'He's harmless.'
- Go to the library instead.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.083
You spend too much time
with criminals.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.250
You think
everyone's
doing wrong.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.542
(Scotty)
'Hey, Kat.'

05:07.625 --> 05:09.375
Hey.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.834
Hello.

05:10.917 --> 05:13.083
Scotty Valens,
this is my mom, Dina.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.208
Hi.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.834
And Veronica.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.041
The ballerina, right?

05:18.125 --> 05:20.000
Do you have a gun like my mom?

05:20.959 --> 05:22.208
I do. Yeah.

05:22.291 --> 05:24.375
Anyway. The library.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.000
See you tonight.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.875
Family drama?

05:35.291 --> 05:38.250
There's this guy at Finley
Park,
where she likes to play.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.959
Why, he up to something?

05:41.041 --> 05:41.959
I don't know.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.250
He just sits there, reading.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.834
But you don't like how he looks.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.500
He doesn't have a kid there.

05:49.625 --> 05:50.875
Just bothers me.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.250
Want me to check him out?

05:54.333 --> 05:55.834
You mind?

05:55.917 --> 05:56.917
Nah.

06:00.500 --> 06:04.125
Grant Bowen, 40,
ER doc at St.
Walter's.

06:04.208 --> 06:07.166
Theory in '84
was a mugging gone wrong.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.834
He's killed on his way
home after his shift.

06:09.917 --> 06:11.333
St. Walt's is in
a rough part of town.

06:11.417 --> 06:13.417
Shot with a .38.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.000
The slug was recovered..

06:15.083 --> 06:16.959
...weapon was never found.

06:17.041 --> 06:19.959
(John)
'Homeless guy they arrested
had on the doc's Top-Siders.'

06:20.041 --> 06:21.500
But he could've taken them
after the doc was killed.

06:21.583 --> 06:24.208
Jury didn't think
so.
Guy was convicted.

06:24.291 --> 06:25.959
Died in jail two months later.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.625
The only physical evidence
was a red, heart-shaped
sticker

06:28.709 --> 06:29.834
'found by the doc's body.'

06:29.917 --> 06:31.083
Valentine's heart?

06:31.166 --> 06:34.083
Murder was in August,
not February.

06:34.166 --> 06:35.542
According to this witness

06:35.625 --> 06:37.500
'Doc was chatting it
up with the doer.'

06:37.583 --> 06:39.875
Who had a hospital
baseball cap.

06:39.959 --> 06:41.583
Huh, something personal.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.458
Will's on his way to Drexel.

06:43.542 --> 06:44.875
Widow's an English
professor there.

06:44.959 --> 06:47.000
You could still catch up
with him if you hurry.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.709
He's off desk duty?

06:48.792 --> 06:50.709
- Boss brokered a deal.
- I had to.

06:50.792 --> 06:53.125
The man was playing
with a flying squirrel.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.125
(female #1)
'I met Grant
when he was a resident.'

06:58.208 --> 07:01.959
Broke my ankle ice-skating,
he put on the cast.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.917
And the rest is history?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.375
And we were such opposites.

07:05.458 --> 07:06.667
Opposites how?

07:06.750 --> 07:09.000
I come from a family
of academics.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.959
Grant was a steel worker's son.

07:12.041 --> 07:14.500
He sure made good.
Becoming a doctor.

07:14.583 --> 07:18.875
And he could've worked anywhere,
but he wanted to give back.

07:18.959 --> 07:20.083
That's why St. Walter's.

07:20.166 --> 07:21.750
We have new information

07:21.834 --> 07:25.125
that your husband may have been
shot by someone he knew, Anne.

07:25.208 --> 07:26.333
A white guy.

07:26.417 --> 07:29.125
Possibly from the hospital.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.417
Oh, my God.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.959
Anyone that fits
that description

07:32.041 --> 07:34.542
that may have wanted
to hurt Grant?

07:34.625 --> 07:35.834
Maybe.

07:35.917 --> 07:37.375
Another doctor in the ER.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.709
- What's his name?
- Seth Garvey.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.959
They didn't get along?

07:41.041 --> 07:44.625
They did,
but Seth...envied Grant.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.834
- Professionally?
- For starters.

07:46.917 --> 07:50.041
We were at a medical
convention in Atlantic City

07:50.125 --> 07:51.542
eight months before Grant died.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.250
- Here comes the river.
- What's that?

07:59.333 --> 08:00.875
Last common card
dealt.
It's called the river

08:00.959 --> 08:02.625
'cause your hand's
fate depends on it.

08:02.709 --> 08:05.709
- Very existential.
- I love that.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.709
- Yes! Yes!
- Damn.

08:07.792 --> 08:08.875
'Fate is with me.'

08:08.959 --> 08:10.417
Well, I'm in the middle
of a great book

08:10.500 --> 08:12.792
about Sir Francis Bacon,
so I'm going up.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.291
- Coming?
- Mm, another half an hour.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.750
Come here.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.542
You got beginner's luck,
like I've never seen.

08:20.625 --> 08:26.709
Yep, my father used to say
better to be lucky than smart.

08:26.792 --> 08:27.917
Adios, boys.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.792
Hey, let me walk you up, Anne.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.750
A lot of shady characters about.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.500
Podiatrists and the like.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.417
You know, I never heard
Grant
mention his dad before.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.917
- Usually doesn't.
- Why's that?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.750
He was a drunk.
Deadbeat.

08:41.834 --> 08:43.417
And Grant's perfect.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.834
Overcompensating I guess.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.375
He's not perfect.

08:48.709 --> 08:51.417
- But almost.
- Must be fun to live with.

08:52.750 --> 08:53.917
So..

08:54.000 --> 08:55.542
...where to?

08:56.667 --> 08:58.875
What?

08:58.959 --> 09:00.834
"She is beautiful..

09:00.917 --> 09:02.625
"...therefore to be wooed.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.458
"She is a woman..

09:04.542 --> 09:06.417
...therefore to be won."

09:07.417 --> 09:09.417
Henry the Sixth.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.458
Are you hitting on me, Seth?

09:11.542 --> 09:13.625
- Yes.
- Well, don't.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.959
He take the hint, stay away?

09:20.041 --> 09:22.834
Asked me to marry him,
few months after Grant died.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.417
Guess that'd be a no.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.750
Kind of had the fever
for Anne Bowen.

09:30.709 --> 09:32.458
Huh, Dr. Garvey?

09:32.542 --> 09:34.250
No kind of about it.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.875
(Kat)
'Didn't matter, she was
married to a fellow Doc?

09:36.959 --> 09:39.000
Not saying I'm proud of it.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.375
But the heart
is a lonely hunter.

09:41.458 --> 09:43.917
Were you lonely enough to try
and get rid of Grant?

09:44.041 --> 09:45.125
Whoa, whoa.

09:45.208 --> 09:46.667
[chuckles]
Left field.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.625
(Kat)
'New angle on his murder.'

09:48.709 --> 09:50.667
He was shot by someone he knew.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.166
'From your hospital.'

09:52.250 --> 09:54.417
You think I killed him
so that I could be with Anne?

09:54.500 --> 09:55.875
Did you?

09:55.959 --> 09:57.625
- That's crazy.
- Not really.

09:57.709 --> 09:58.917
Happens all the time.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.083
[sighs]
Alright, look..

10:01.166 --> 10:03.000
...I admit
I was jealous of Grant.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.125
I mean, he was one
of these guys that had it
all.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.333
But then
he started falling apart.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.333
What was going on?

10:09.417 --> 10:11.458
His past was catching up to him.

10:11.542 --> 10:14.667
- Specifically?
- His genetic past.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.250
Like his dad, he was an addict.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.208
- Drugs?
- Cards.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.083
Got the bug in Atlantic City.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.000
Then we went to a local game
near the hospital.

10:28.417 --> 10:31.709
- Last hand.
- You said that two hours ago.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.208
Gonna get lucky this time.

10:33.291 --> 10:36.000
Said that two hours ago, too.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.291
Crap.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.041
Lemme make a call.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.208
Got a lie cooked up, Doc?

10:47.291 --> 10:49.583
- A lie?
- Car trouble.

10:49.667 --> 10:50.750
Friend in need.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.375
Why don't you just
go home to her?

10:52.458 --> 10:54.625
Or considering
that you're a doc, though,

10:54.709 --> 10:56.959
I'd go with a pileup
on the expressway.

10:57.041 --> 10:58.792
'Lot of casualties.'

11:03.625 --> 11:06.208
Hey. I-I'm so sorry.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.458
Yeah, I know.

11:09.542 --> 11:11.083
Maybe half an hour.

11:11.166 --> 11:12.792
'It's been so busy down here.'

11:13.500 --> 11:14.583
Umm..

11:19.041 --> 11:21.000
Actually..

11:21.083 --> 11:22.875
There was a pileup
on the expressway.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.583
Yeah.

11:25.667 --> 11:26.792
'Terrible.'

11:26.875 --> 11:28.208
'Maybe an hour more.'

11:28.291 --> 11:30.750
Okay. Bye, honey.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.667
(male #2)
'That's the spirit.'

11:40.750 --> 11:42.208
I'm putting everything in.

11:42.291 --> 11:45.166
Whoa, Doc,
that's
a lot of money.

11:46.166 --> 11:47.333
You sure about that?

11:47.417 --> 11:49.083
Nothing's sure.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.542
That's what's so great.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.375
You bluffing me?

12:11.041 --> 12:12.709
That doesn't cover it.

12:16.166 --> 12:17.750
Then I'll throw in
my wedding ring.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.917
What do you say?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.458
See the river.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.333
Showtime, Doc.

12:33.417 --> 12:35.083
Pair of bullets.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.917
You bet everything
on a stinking pair of twos?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.709
You lousy river rat.

12:50.792 --> 12:53.583
- I knew my luck was turning.
- I'll take you down, Doc.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.875
Do you hear me?

12:55.959 --> 12:57.375
You're going down!

13:00.000 --> 13:03.083
Who was this guy
lost his wedding ring?

13:03.166 --> 13:04.500
Cy Tisdale.

13:04.583 --> 13:05.750
He hung around the hospital

13:05.834 --> 13:07.583
getting paid to be
in medical trials.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.041
Think he was dangerous?

13:09.125 --> 13:11.709
He had a pretty shady
existence,
degenerate gambler.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.500
Which takes money.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.542
Money a rich Doc
like Grant had..

13:16.625 --> 13:18.709
...and Cy needed.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.834
Anna Kournikova.

13:32.917 --> 13:34.458
(Nick)
'What's that?'

13:34.542 --> 13:36.041
'Ace, King.'

13:36.125 --> 13:37.875
looks good but never wins.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.458
You guys want in?

13:44.333 --> 13:45.875
(Nick)
'Like a bunch of roaches.'

13:45.959 --> 13:48.208
- Where are you going?
- I ain't the ringleader
here.

13:48.291 --> 13:49.333
Why are you pickin' on me?

13:49.417 --> 13:51.125
'Cause you knew Grant Bowen.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.750
True. Okay?

13:55.834 --> 13:58.875
He was shot, not long after
you made a threat against him.

13:58.959 --> 14:02.458
Said you'd take him down,
so maybe you did.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.625
Aw, that was just card talk.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.375
Besides, a mugger killed him.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.291
No. New witness
says it was a guy

14:10.375 --> 14:11.917
'with a St. Walt's
baseball cap .'

14:12.000 --> 14:14.083
Like the one you took
right of of Grant's head.

14:14.166 --> 14:18.250
Nah, I..
I gave that back to the doc.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.083
Same night I took it from him.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.125
Same night we became friends.

14:22.208 --> 14:25.417
Recall where you were
when Grant was killed?

14:27.208 --> 14:29.750
Playing poker
at Skinny's Tavern.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.250
- Ask Skinny, he'll tell
you.
- Will do.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.750
Besides, I never
would have hurt the doc.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.291
He was my protege.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.834
No offense, Cy, but..

14:38.917 --> 14:40.834
You don't seem
like the mentor type.

14:40.917 --> 14:44.333
I tried to teach him
the game, but the guy..

14:45.875 --> 14:47.959
...was torn between two lovers.

15:04.375 --> 15:08.750
Well, a toast, to Jason's
future alma mater.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.125
- Cornell.
- Ah.

15:12.458 --> 15:15.625
I hear you've been shadowing
your dad in the ER, Jason?

15:15.709 --> 15:17.542
But he's surgeon material.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.750
I like the ER.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.250
'People need
your help right away'

15:20.333 --> 15:21.542
and then, you save them.

15:21.625 --> 15:23.000
(Anne)
'And they're forever
grateful.'

15:23.083 --> 15:26.000
Like Mrs. Lee,
who brought another angelfish

15:26.083 --> 15:27.500
'for our aquarium today.'

15:27.583 --> 15:29.709
'Cause that's how she thinks
of you, as her angel.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.000
(Grant)
'Oh, boy.'

15:33.166 --> 15:34.291
You sure?

15:34.375 --> 15:36.250
(male #1)
'I'm afraid so.'

15:36.333 --> 15:37.792
What's wrong?

15:37.875 --> 15:39.500
Credit cards aren't working.

15:41.667 --> 15:43.041
I didn't bring my purse.

15:44.208 --> 15:47.250
Uh, I'll just have
to write a check.

15:47.333 --> 15:48.959
I'm afraid we don't take checks.

15:49.041 --> 15:52.208
Well, you just might have
to make an exception tonight.

15:52.834 --> 15:54.166
I'm sorry, sir.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.208
Uh, that's the ER.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.333
'Damn it. Uh..'

16:03.417 --> 16:05.542
Um, I'll take
that check, waiter.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.875
No. No, we invited you.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.917
I'm so sorry, but..

16:11.834 --> 16:13.000
...I'm on call.

16:13.083 --> 16:14.583
Sara's dad is not paying.

16:14.667 --> 16:16.333
(Anne)
'No, he's not.'

16:16.417 --> 16:18.250
We'll get to the bottom of this.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.959
Please, order dessert.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.208
What's going on?

16:29.291 --> 16:32.041
I don't know.
It's a bank
snafu.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.750
It's really embarrassing.

16:33.834 --> 16:35.208
Anne, I-I have to run.

16:35.291 --> 16:37.041
You can't just walk out on
your
son's graduation dinner

16:37.125 --> 16:38.417
It's work.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.166
and stick his girlfriend's
parents with the bill.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.083
It's the hospital.
Look, I have to go.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.083
Why are you on call
tonight, anyway?

16:47.500 --> 16:49.041
I'm sorry.

16:56.959 --> 16:59.625
It was the game or the lady..

17:01.000 --> 17:02.333
...and the lady lost.

17:02.417 --> 17:05.750
You think she knew
what
the competition was?

17:05.834 --> 17:07.375
My experience?

17:07.458 --> 17:10.291
Wives always know.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.750
I hear you.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.709
(Lilly)
'Did some checking, Anne.'

17:15.792 --> 17:19.208
You got $1.5 million
in life insurance

17:19.291 --> 17:20.917
after Grant died.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.500
Yes. So?

17:23.583 --> 17:27.542
So it must have come in handy,
considering you were broke.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.792
If you think I'm some
kind of black widow..

17:29.875 --> 17:31.542
I know there
were money problems.

17:31.625 --> 17:34.583
Grant was screwing up
your life, humiliating you.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.500
He was in trouble.

17:36.583 --> 17:37.834
But you didn't mention that.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.166
What does that have to
do
with him dying?

17:41.250 --> 17:42.625
Maybe everything

17:42.709 --> 17:44.417
because maybe
you did something about it.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.000
I tried.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.792
I tried to save him.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.291
Any luck?

17:50.375 --> 17:51.917
None.

17:58.834 --> 18:00.792
(Anne)
'What are you doing?'

18:04.041 --> 18:07.041
Uh, just, uh..

18:07.125 --> 18:08.417
...looking for a pen.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.417
You're trying to steal from me?

18:11.500 --> 18:13.166
[sighs]
That's ridiculous.

18:13.250 --> 18:15.250
Yes, it is,
but that's what you're doing.

18:17.041 --> 18:18.625
Cornell called today.

18:18.709 --> 18:20.750
'Tuition check bounced.'

18:22.583 --> 18:24.291
- Bank snafu.
- Another one?

18:24.375 --> 18:25.917
- Must be.
- Grant, you're a doctor.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.208
I'm a professor, and both
our bank accounts are empty.

18:29.291 --> 18:31.542
What the hell is happening?

18:31.625 --> 18:32.834
Okay, uh..

18:36.667 --> 18:38.959
I've been playing poker.

18:39.041 --> 18:40.375
You gambled away our money?

18:40.458 --> 18:42.000
But I'm going to win it back.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.709
Grant.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.709
When I'm at that table?

18:45.792 --> 18:48.041
It's like I'm playing with fate.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.709
It's dangerous and exhilarating.

18:50.792 --> 18:52.875
It sounds like
you're talking about a drug.

18:52.959 --> 18:55.625
But you can't
get
good at a drug.

18:55.709 --> 18:57.208
Do you hear yourself?

18:57.291 --> 18:59.750
I'm getting good, really good.

19:06.792 --> 19:09.083
- That's the ER.
- No it's not.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.333
It hasn't been the
ER
in a long time, has
it?

19:11.417 --> 19:13.375
I'm gonna win it all back.

19:13.458 --> 19:16.041
Stop.
Before Jason finds
out.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.041
Don't tell him. It's just
a temporary problem.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.625
He's going to find out
when
we can't pay his tuition.

19:20.709 --> 19:22.166
Just trust me!

19:24.917 --> 19:27.000
We'd been married 18 years.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.500
And suddenly..

19:31.333 --> 19:33.458
...I didn't know him anymore.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.333
- Did your son find out?
- Yeah.

19:39.417 --> 19:41.917
'Cause we couldn't
afford Cornell.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.208
That must have crushed him.

19:44.709 --> 19:47.125
He had to go to
community
college.

19:47.208 --> 19:49.417
Work two jobs.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.792
It turned him
against
Grant forever.

19:51.875 --> 19:55.917
So when Grant died,
he and Jason were estranged.

19:57.875 --> 20:00.083
At least with
the insurance money

20:00.166 --> 20:03.709
Jason got to transfer
to Cornell the next year.

20:04.458 --> 20:05.917
He's a doctor now.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.583
Just like he always wanted.

20:14.417 --> 20:16.458
(Nick)
'You know that witness, Edie?'

20:16.542 --> 20:18.375
(Will)
The ex-junkie?

20:18.458 --> 20:20.333
- She called me.
- And?

20:21.667 --> 20:23.542
That's it. Just saying.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.458
(Will)
'Saying what?'

20:25.542 --> 20:27.083
Saying that maybe
I'm not a 100%

20:27.166 --> 20:29.500
totally washed up
in the dating world.

20:29.583 --> 20:32.709
Because a crack-ho called you?

20:32.792 --> 20:34.792
Why you have to say
it like that?

20:34.875 --> 20:37.375
'I got something on Jason.'
One of his two jobs?

20:37.458 --> 20:40.291
Was working at the blood
bank at St. Walter's.

20:40.375 --> 20:41.291
That relevant?

20:41.375 --> 20:42.500
According to the Web site

20:42.583 --> 20:43.625
each time you donate

20:43.709 --> 20:45.125
you get juice, a cookie

20:45.208 --> 20:46.750
and a red, heart-shaped sticker.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.250
Like the one at our crime scene.

20:48.333 --> 20:49.709
That's the trifecta right there.

20:49.792 --> 20:52.041
Knows the victim, associated
with the hospital

20:52.125 --> 20:53.625
and that sticker.

20:53.709 --> 20:56.625
And a million and a half
reasons
to see his dad dead.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.417
Which one's yours?

21:35.583 --> 21:38.333
Oh, none.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.709
You like the
boys
or the girls?

21:45.792 --> 21:46.792
Excuse me?

21:46.875 --> 21:48.834
Seems like
you're
watching the..

21:48.917 --> 21:51.375
...kid in blue pretty close.

21:51.458 --> 21:52.792
(Bob)
'I don't know what you mean.'

21:52.875 --> 21:56.041
He's weak, no friends.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.417
- He's a good pick.
- I'm trying to read.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.125
'You'd rather have
the blonde kid.'

22:02.792 --> 22:05.250
He's popular, athletic.

22:05.333 --> 22:06.750
'You move on him'

22:06.834 --> 22:09.000
he'll tell you
to go pound sand.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.875
Guess you know
something about it.

22:30.291 --> 22:31.750
I know what you are.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.208
I make a study out
of people like you.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.208
I'm not doing anything.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.834
You're
thinking
about it.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.458
No law against that.

22:46.709 --> 22:49.375
You're not gonna
read here anymore.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.250
You're gonna walk
away right now.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.834
And if you come back..

22:53.959 --> 22:55.458
...I'll find you

22:55.542 --> 22:57.083
and I'll wreck you.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.291
We have to talk, Jason.

23:19.041 --> 23:21.375
Who asked you to open
my dad's case again?

23:21.458 --> 23:22.625
We don't need a formal invite.

23:22.709 --> 23:24.166
I'm just wondering
who the hell cares.

23:24.250 --> 23:27.000
- I know I don't.
- That's pretty tough.

23:27.083 --> 23:30.333
I have surgery in six
minutes,
and I'm punctual, so..

23:30.417 --> 23:32.625
So, where were you
when your dad was killed?

23:32.709 --> 23:34.000
You're talking
to me like a
suspect.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.125
Picked up on that, huh?

23:35.208 --> 23:36.750
We're down
to five minutes
now.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.875
He embarrassed you in front
of your girlfriend

23:39.959 --> 23:41.333
made you pull
out the Cornell.

23:41.417 --> 23:42.834
'All 'cause
of his gambling.'

23:42.917 --> 23:44.709
I'm not denying
he was a bum.

23:46.166 --> 23:47.500
Did you always
think that?

23:48.500 --> 23:49.959
No.

23:50.041 --> 23:52.166
I used to worship him.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.333
I watched him raise people
from the dead.

23:55.583 --> 23:56.834
Can't see something
like that

23:56.917 --> 23:58.792
and not want to be
just like the guy.

23:58.875 --> 24:00.959
- But then he let you down.
- Yeah.

24:01.041 --> 24:03.875
Well, that's the way
it goes.

24:05.583 --> 24:08.083
So, that night?

24:08.166 --> 24:10.709
I was at a bar, Clancy's.

24:10.792 --> 24:12.834
Got drunk, first.
Only time in my life.

24:13.834 --> 24:15.166
Why that of all nights?

24:15.250 --> 24:18.583
Because I'd just seen
first-hand
what my dad had become.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.542
- A bum?
- And a menace.

24:22.375 --> 24:24.208
Dr. Bowen,
my husband is back.

24:24.291 --> 24:25.500
Really? Sorry.

24:25.583 --> 24:27.417
He's in the OR.
Will you check on him?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.083
- You're the only one--
- Can't just now, Mrs. Lee.

24:33.291 --> 24:35.583
Start a line.
2 million units of
penicillin

24:35.667 --> 24:37.125
500 of gent.

24:38.750 --> 24:40.500
- Dad!
- Quiet, Jason.

24:40.583 --> 24:44.333
- But, Dad, the chart..
- Jason, you watch, I work.

24:44.417 --> 24:45.667
'Understand?'

24:52.834 --> 24:54.083
Dr. Garvey!

24:55.667 --> 24:57.000
He's giving him penicillin.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.000
Stop! He's pen
allergic, Grant.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.417
- What?
- Clindamycin.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.625
And get Dr. Marsh.
You, come with me.

25:13.458 --> 25:15.250
You could've sent him
into anaphylactic shock.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.667
I missed it, sorry.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.458
Sorry is for when you show
up
to work a zombie.

25:18.542 --> 25:19.917
Sorry is for when you
borrow
thousands of dollars

25:20.000 --> 25:21.083
and never pay back.

25:21.166 --> 25:22.542
Spare me the lecture.

25:22.625 --> 25:24.000
But sorry doesn't cover nearly
killing a patient

25:24.083 --> 25:25.792
because you're so
distracted and tired

25:25.875 --> 25:27.125
that all you think
about is gambling.

25:27.208 --> 25:29.041
This has nothing
to do with the cards.

25:29.125 --> 25:30.583
You have a problem.

25:30.667 --> 25:31.834
- That's crap.
- Admit it.

25:31.917 --> 25:33.917
I need sleep.
I worked two shifts.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.959
- Stop lying.
- 'He's right.'

25:38.500 --> 25:40.834
- What?
- Mom knows it, too.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.500
You lie about
everything now.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.709
Now, you're both
lecturing me?

25:49.208 --> 25:51.875
- What the hell is this?
- End of the line, Grant.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.375
You're coming with me.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.417
End of innocence, huh?

26:07.208 --> 26:08.625
You could say.

26:08.709 --> 26:10.792
Where was Dr. Garvey
taking your dad?

26:11.625 --> 26:12.917
I never asked.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.583
There's something you forgot
to tell us, Dr. Garvey?

26:21.667 --> 26:22.917
I don't think so.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.792
You hauled Grant out
of the ER, the day he died.

26:25.875 --> 26:26.959
Makes you last-to-see.

26:27.041 --> 26:28.250
(Rush)
'And maybe the shooter.'

26:28.333 --> 26:29.458
I didn't shoot Grant.

26:29.542 --> 26:31.125
You did something
you tried to hide.

26:31.208 --> 26:33.750
Yeah. I covered for Grant
when he almost killed a
patient.

26:33.834 --> 26:35.250
The hospital
could
have been sued.

26:35.333 --> 26:38.917
The fact remains, you're
the last guy seen with Grant.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.291
You had it bad
for his wife

26:40.375 --> 26:41.625
and you were jealous
of him at work.

26:41.709 --> 26:43.125
Not at that point.

26:43.208 --> 26:45.083
I wasn't jealous of
him
in any way.

26:45.166 --> 26:47.083
- 'No?'
- 'I pitied him.'

26:47.166 --> 26:49.834
And, yes, I interfered.

26:49.917 --> 26:51.208
I did it for her.

26:52.792 --> 26:55.166
- Anne.
- You did what?

26:55.250 --> 26:58.000
I took him to a
Gambler's
anonymous meeting.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.458
'Basement of Saint Michael's.'

26:59.542 --> 27:01.875
- He sit still for that?
- As far as I know.

27:01.959 --> 27:04.375
I stayed a few minutes,
but I was working.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.834
Anyone see you
leave the meeting?

27:06.917 --> 27:09.917
Yeah. That mutt
Cy Tisdale.

27:22.083 --> 27:23.792
Those food stamps
you're playing for?

27:29.041 --> 27:30.166
Lot of bazooms.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.000
Got some new
information,
Cy.

27:35.792 --> 27:37.250
What now?

27:39.667 --> 27:42.500
Witness put you and Grant
at a Gambler's anonymous meeting

27:42.583 --> 27:43.917
the day of the murder.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.417
Want to tell us why
you failed to mention
that?

27:45.500 --> 27:47.125
Not really. No.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.291
Went to talk
to your old pal
Skinny.

27:49.375 --> 27:50.834
See about that
alibi of yours.

27:50.917 --> 27:52.667
Oh, yeah?
How's he doing?

27:52.750 --> 27:54.583
- Not so good.
- Been dead a decade.

27:54.667 --> 27:56.333
But that's no
surprise
to you, is it?

27:56.417 --> 27:57.917
I got feelings, you know.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.250
- That's hurtful.
- Quit bluffing, Cy.

28:01.333 --> 28:03.792
Tell us what happened
to Dr. Bowen that day.

28:06.667 --> 28:09.500
The birds is what happened.

28:09.583 --> 28:13.375
- Birds?
- Pigeons, to be exact.

28:15.834 --> 28:18.166
I almost killed
someone today..

28:18.250 --> 28:19.625
...right in front
of my son.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.792
And now he hates me.

28:23.875 --> 28:25.542
'And it's not even
an hour later'

28:25.625 --> 28:29.667
and all I can think about
is how to get to a game.

28:31.041 --> 28:32.458
'I've lost my wife..'

28:33.417 --> 28:36.208
...my son, my job.

28:37.625 --> 28:41.625
But I keep thinking
my luck will turn.

28:41.709 --> 28:44.083
'That's the beauty
of chance.'

28:45.709 --> 28:47.291
The beauty I couldn't resist.

28:48.542 --> 28:49.875
'I will have to try, though.'

28:51.083 --> 28:54.250
Try accepting
I'm going out a loser.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.125
What the hell
are you doing here?

29:05.208 --> 29:07.208
- I come here sometimes.
- To quit?

29:07.291 --> 29:10.125
To remind myself
why I don't wanna quit.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.500
Look at these sad sacks.

29:13.583 --> 29:16.375
Put a C-note in any of their
hands, they'd be out the door.

29:17.917 --> 29:20.166
Not me. Not anymore.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.875
- Had a dream last night, Doc.
- Oh, yeah?

29:22.959 --> 29:25.458
Had the ten, jack,
queen and king of spades.

29:25.542 --> 29:29.333
And the river...it dropped me
the ace of spades.

29:29.417 --> 29:30.750
A royal flush.

29:30.834 --> 29:32.792
I think it's
a premonition

29:32.875 --> 29:34.709
that our luck's
about to change.

29:34.792 --> 29:36.375
That's your dream, Cy.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.417
Mine are all nightmares.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.375
Oh, no. Look at that,
would you?

29:43.083 --> 29:46.125
A buck says
the gray flies off first.

29:48.834 --> 29:50.792
I'm quitting, Cy.

29:50.875 --> 29:52.083
Tell you what.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.458
You take the gray,
I'll take speckles.

30:04.291 --> 30:05.834
I'll take speckles.

30:05.917 --> 30:07.250
(Cy)
'That's the spirit.'

30:10.125 --> 30:11.333
'You see?'

30:11.417 --> 30:14.208
Now, that's a hell of a good
omen if I ever saw one.

30:16.959 --> 30:18.959
Even if I wanted to play

30:19.041 --> 30:20.792
there's no way
to get money.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.291
No one left to hit up.

30:22.375 --> 30:24.041
There'll be someone.

30:25.458 --> 30:27.250
There's always someone.

30:28.625 --> 30:29.875
Yeah.

30:32.125 --> 30:33.625
Maybe one person.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.792
So, who was gonna
stake him?

30:39.875 --> 30:42.917
Said there was a
wife
of a guy he saved.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.083
Owned a store
that sold
fish.

30:46.250 --> 30:47.709
He was going to
borrow
from her?

30:47.792 --> 30:49.458
He was past borrowing.

30:51.834 --> 30:53.500
He was gonna rob her.

31:03.458 --> 31:06.792
So, you were right
about that guy in the park.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.041
He was trolling.

31:08.125 --> 31:10.583
- I had a feeling.
- I talked to him.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.583
He ain't coming back.

31:12.667 --> 31:14.417
Really?

31:14.500 --> 31:16.125
- 'Cause..
- What?

31:16.208 --> 31:19.583
My mom said he was gone
yesterday, but back today.

31:21.166 --> 31:22.375
No kidding?

31:23.834 --> 31:25.083
This is it.

31:31.333 --> 31:35.375
- Mrs. Lee?
- Yes?

31:35.458 --> 31:37.875
We need to talk to you
about Dr. Grant Bowen.

31:39.166 --> 31:41.000
Dr. Bowen is dead.

31:41.083 --> 31:42.500
That's why we're here.

31:42.583 --> 31:44.625
Your husband
was a patient of his?

31:44.709 --> 31:46.792
My husband is
dead now, too.

31:46.875 --> 31:49.625
Did Dr. Bowen come
to see you, Mrs.
Lee?

31:49.709 --> 31:51.375
Try and rob you?

31:51.458 --> 31:53.125
Dr. Bowen was a good man.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.875
We know you told him
about having cash on hand.

31:55.959 --> 31:57.750
And how indebted
you were to him.

31:57.834 --> 32:00.083
He saved my
husband's life.

32:01.417 --> 32:04.333
But he wasn't
himself that day.

32:04.417 --> 32:06.417
So, he did come see you?

32:06.500 --> 32:08.834
'After closing.'

32:08.917 --> 32:13.041
And I tried to give him
luck.
But it didn't work.

32:26.417 --> 32:29.208
- Dr. Bowen?
- Mrs. Lee.

32:29.291 --> 32:30.709
I-I thought you'd be
at the hospital

32:30.792 --> 32:32.125
with your husband.

32:32.959 --> 32:34.333
How did you get in?

32:34.417 --> 32:38.166
I, uh...the
back door was open.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.500
Is my husband okay?

32:39.583 --> 32:41.500
Yes. Yes. He's fine.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.458
It's-it's the bill
that-that's the
problem.

32:45.542 --> 32:47.291
- The hospital bill?
- 'Yes.'

32:47.375 --> 32:50.208
'Uh, There-there were some
additional charges.'

32:50.291 --> 32:55.083
Uh, central line kit,
anesthesia.

32:55.166 --> 32:59.625
Uh...I remember when you said
you could pay in cash?

32:59.709 --> 33:02.250
And you're here
for the money now?

33:03.500 --> 33:04.917
Yes, yeah.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.750
'Thousand dollars.'

33:30.667 --> 33:33.166
This isn't all
your money, is it?

33:33.250 --> 33:35.709
You saved my husband.

33:53.667 --> 33:55.583
[sighing]
Wait..

33:57.750 --> 33:59.000
I can't do this.

34:12.375 --> 34:13.750
I'm going to take, uh..

34:15.792 --> 34:17.041
...three hundred..

34:18.333 --> 34:20.125
...'and twenty-four dollars.'

34:20.208 --> 34:22.792
And I'm not going
to be paying you back.

34:22.875 --> 34:24.667
'Whatever it is'

34:24.750 --> 34:26.417
it can't be that bad.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.625
Hmm.

34:29.709 --> 34:32.917
It's funny, what a life
ends up being worth.

34:40.959 --> 34:42.542
Wait, Dr. Bowen.

34:48.875 --> 34:50.333
Take this.

34:50.417 --> 34:53.709
- For good luck.
- I'm beyond luck.

34:57.917 --> 34:59.750
Everyone needs luck.

35:03.750 --> 35:07.667
So, he left with $324.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.250
Pretty specific amount.

35:09.333 --> 35:12.250
And my not-so-lucky
luck charm.

35:23.583 --> 35:24.875
Dealt you hands

35:26.041 --> 35:27.375
but took a peek.

35:29.417 --> 35:31.125
You got a gay waiter.

35:33.375 --> 35:34.834
A queen with a trey.

35:38.792 --> 35:40.166
Where'd you get this, Cy?

35:41.583 --> 35:44.625
Won it in a game...
way back.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.000
Wrong.

35:46.083 --> 35:47.709
You took it from Grant
when you killed him.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.583
Guess you thought
you could use the luck.

35:50.625 --> 35:52.041
I'm gonna need a lawyer.

35:53.208 --> 35:55.166
Except I can't
afford one,
so..

35:56.583 --> 35:58.917
...I guess
I'll
just clam
up.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.291
Being a guinea pig at
St. Walt's wasn't the only way

36:01.375 --> 36:03.208
you were making money
back then, was it, Cy?

36:03.291 --> 36:05.375
(Vera)
'You also got paid
for giving blood.'

36:07.709 --> 36:10.458
That's 'cause
I got the lucky blood.

36:10.542 --> 36:12.041
'O negative.'

36:12.125 --> 36:13.250
Universal donor.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.959
You donated the day
Grant died.

36:15.041 --> 36:16.667
And got yourself
a red heart sticker.

36:16.750 --> 36:19.291
Which you must have dropped
when you shot Grant.

36:20.834 --> 36:22.417
I'm a poker player, lady.

36:24.291 --> 36:25.583
I ain't folding my hand
just 'cause you got

36:25.667 --> 36:27.750
some good face cards.

36:27.834 --> 36:29.875
Witness who saw Grant's
murder is coming in.

36:29.959 --> 36:31.625
'She's gonna ID you,
and you're gonna go down'

36:31.709 --> 36:33.208
without a friend
in the world.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.875
I don't need friends.

36:41.291 --> 36:42.709
I got 52 of them..

36:44.166 --> 36:45.625
...right here.

36:49.417 --> 36:51.125
We know you did it, Cy.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.458
'We just
don't
know why.'

37:16.041 --> 37:18.625
They let you play
cards in jail?

37:18.709 --> 37:20.000
Sure.

37:22.834 --> 37:25.333
Been a prisoner
to this deck so long..

37:30.083 --> 37:33.250
...bars instead of a door
won't make much of a
difference.

37:34.417 --> 37:35.834
What made you do it?

37:38.417 --> 37:40.542
I thought Grant
was your friend.

37:43.083 --> 37:44.500
He was.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.500
That's why.

37:58.583 --> 38:00.083
Thought we were going
to meet a half hour ago?

38:00.166 --> 38:02.500
Had to go to Western
Union.
Send a money order.

38:02.583 --> 38:04.583
Priorities, doc.
Money order can wait.

38:04.667 --> 38:05.959
'We gotta game to go to.'

38:06.041 --> 38:09.667
Paid off my life insurance.
$324.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.500
How much you got left?

38:11.583 --> 38:13.250
Change of plans, Cy.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.709
What the hell?
That Skinny's gun.

38:18.792 --> 38:21.500
Yeah. I took it from
behind
the bar. No one saw me.

38:21.583 --> 38:23.625
What do we need a gun for?

38:23.709 --> 38:26.959
I think I know a way
to go out a winner,
Cy.

38:28.542 --> 38:30.500
Keep my promise
to my wife.

38:30.583 --> 38:32.083
You need a gun
for that?

38:33.625 --> 38:35.709
You're gonna kill me.

38:41.875 --> 38:43.125
You're bluffing.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.709
My wife and son can't
think I killed myself.

38:48.792 --> 38:50.041
Don't be stupid.

38:51.458 --> 38:53.750
Dying isn't winning, doc.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.250
You remember back to when
you were married, Cy?

38:59.333 --> 39:01.125
When you had kids?

39:01.208 --> 39:05.041
You would've done
right
by then, if you
could've.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.583
I ain't shooting you.

39:08.375 --> 39:12.792
I go and my family gets
a million and a half
dollars.

39:12.875 --> 39:14.750
What do I get?

39:14.834 --> 39:17.000
You get to know you
did
right by me.

39:21.667 --> 39:24.917
I'm a louse, doc.
Remember?

39:25.000 --> 39:26.583
Selfish through
and through.

39:26.667 --> 39:28.750
And that's
where
I'm headed.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.250
To where you're at.

39:30.333 --> 39:32.667
To a wasted life.

39:32.750 --> 39:34.041
You want that for me?

39:35.875 --> 39:38.125
It ain't so bad.

39:38.208 --> 39:39.709
Now, who's bluffing.

39:44.625 --> 39:45.834
So what?

39:47.458 --> 39:51.166
I ain't pretending
my life ain't wasted.

39:51.250 --> 39:53.875
But I ain't telling anybody
to shoot me either.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.375
That's 'cause you
got
nothing to die for.

39:58.291 --> 39:59.667
And I do.

40:08.875 --> 40:10.542
(Bowen)
'Please.'

40:10.625 --> 40:14.709
I got the ten, jack, queen..

40:14.792 --> 40:17.375
'...king of spades here.'

40:17.458 --> 40:21.542
And all you got to do
is...
deal me that ace.

40:51.625 --> 40:52.875
Here.

40:54.166 --> 40:56.166
Take this for luck.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.500
How do you know
you're not going

40:57.583 --> 40:59.417
to be needing it
where you're going?

41:01.750 --> 41:02.959
I don't.

41:05.542 --> 41:08.542
That's what I loved
about playing cards.

41:08.625 --> 41:10.083
What's that?

41:11.709 --> 41:15.917
That not knowing...what
the river was gonna bring me.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.875
It's gonna be aces
for you, doc.

41:26.625 --> 41:28.667
All aces.

44:17.458 --> 44:18.709
