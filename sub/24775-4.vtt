00:19.800 --> 00:21.440
-There's one.
-Is it stopping?

00:23.960 --> 00:24.840
No.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.480
We're stuck here if they keep patrolling.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.320
-What are you doing?
-Just taking a look.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.840
Fuck, Jean, get down.
You will get us all killed.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.520
-Sorry.
-What were you thinking?

00:38.600 --> 00:40.320
I thought God protected you.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.800
Well, he does, but not from stupidity.

00:47.000 --> 00:47.960
I'm not stupid.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.640
No, you aren't,
but that was a stupid thing to do.

00:55.760 --> 00:56.880
You're nice, Jean.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.720
-What?
-You're nice.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.000
Christ, that's something
your mom calls you.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.960
"Jean, you're nice.
Jean, you're a good boy."

01:07.800 --> 01:08.880
But you are.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.400
I'm not so sure.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.320
You've always been nice to me.

01:22.000 --> 01:22.840
<i>Lea...</i>

01:24.200 --> 01:27.200
<i>Does everybody make it into heaven,
<i>no matter what they have done?</i></i>

01:27.680 --> 01:28.520
<i>What?</i>

01:30.680 --> 01:32.240
<i>I did a terrible thing.</i>

01:33.480 --> 01:37.680
It doesn't matter what you've done
in the past. It's all about who you are.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.120
And I know who you are.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.680
<i>You know nothing.</i>

02:15.680 --> 02:16.880
Help me.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.280
Don't tell the others,
or they won't bring us along.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.800
Shit!

03:09.000 --> 03:09.920
It's that bad?

03:10.440 --> 03:11.960
You need a doctor.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.760
Here, I have some morphine.

03:17.880 --> 03:18.720
Hi.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.400
Are you thirsty?

03:23.760 --> 03:24.600
Thanks.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.480
I don't know how we're gonna cross.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.880
The Øresund Bridge is the only way.
It's too risky to walk across.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.360
We'll be exposed with nowhere to hide.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.560
But it's our only option.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.120
Martin, he needs that doctor.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.960
Please help us get across.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.120
You look a bit pale, handsome.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.600
Okay, we'll wrap ourselves up
and cross in the dark.

03:55.680 --> 03:56.680
Hey!

03:58.440 --> 03:59.720
We're busy here.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.800
So are we.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.120
Okay, doing what?

04:03.200 --> 04:04.360
Nothing.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.320
No.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.120
Okay, we'll cross tonight.
Are you up for it?

04:10.840 --> 04:11.680
Yes.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.040
Good.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.000
Beatrice, you come with me.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.040
What's eating you?

04:22.480 --> 04:23.720
Want to go on a date?

04:27.240 --> 04:28.520
-A date?
-Yes.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.440
Want to go on a date with me
when all this crap is over?

04:34.160 --> 04:35.760
And do what?

04:37.120 --> 04:39.880
There's this place... up north.

04:40.800 --> 04:44.680
Idre. I used to go skiing there
with my family as a kid.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.040
You want to go skiing?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.120
No, but there's a mountain there.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.280
Well, it's just a hill,

04:49.360 --> 04:52.720
but I thought it was
the tallest mountain in the world

04:52.800 --> 04:55.200
and that you could see
the whole world from up there.

04:56.760 --> 05:01.920
I thought we'd start
with a glass of rosé or something.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.560
I'd like that.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.520
What were you and Rasmus laughing at?

05:13.360 --> 05:14.400
You're jealous?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.320
No.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.680
-But you're toying with him.
-No.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.760
Why are you playing this game?

05:23.720 --> 05:25.680
Hey. We have to find another solution.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.160
Rasmus can't walk.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.640
Well, he has to.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.840
We can't drive him across
in a shopping cart.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.520
The Strangers are the only ones
who have vehicles.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.360
Then let's get one of theirs.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.800
You're fucking crazy.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.120
-They're patrolling this area.
-Where?

05:46.200 --> 05:49.080
I saw one right over there,
but I don't know where it is now.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.440
They snatch anyone
who tries to get to the bridge.

05:51.520 --> 05:55.160
-Well, I'll just have to draw them out.
-What a shitty plan.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.240
Be careful, Simone.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.480
They will kill you.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.000
Grab their weapons.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.720
Jean, tie them up.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.760
-Let's just whack them.
-That wasn't the deal.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.240
-We just want their car.
-It's like you live in a fucking cartoon.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.160
Well, fine.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.560
-Sometimes you're a total asshole.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

07:24.640 --> 07:26.280
Patrick, we'll question them first.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.920
About what? Where they buy clothes?
Had breakfast?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.800
Just go start the car, okay?

07:31.240 --> 07:32.080
Come on.

07:32.880 --> 07:33.960
Good job, Simone.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.240
Jesus!

07:42.880 --> 07:44.080
It looks like shit.

07:45.000 --> 07:45.840
Thanks.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.440
At least it's wrapped around
something nice.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.360
You liked hearing that?

07:57.360 --> 07:58.840
Isn't that pretty normal?

08:01.320 --> 08:02.400
I don't know.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.480
I don't like people
saying nice things to me.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.240
Good thing there's nothing nice to say.

08:12.880 --> 08:13.960
You pick up fast.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.280
Your sister and Martin...

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
What about them?

08:23.320 --> 08:25.440
They seem to get along well.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.600
You think she likes him?

08:30.440 --> 08:31.720
You tell me.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.080
But aren't you and Martin a couple?

08:38.080 --> 08:40.280
Nobody owns each other in this world.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.640
But there's still love, isn't there?

08:47.880 --> 08:49.040
You're so young.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.560
Martin.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.600
-Answer it.
-I don't think kicking them will help.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.600
Go ahead, but don't remove their masks.
It'll only make it harder to kill him.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.640
There are more patrols coming.
We gotta go.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.800
-Patrick.
-Wait.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.280
-Simone's just talking to them.
-Shoot them and let's move on.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.480
I will. When I know what they know.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.000
She changes everything to suit herself.

09:47.560 --> 09:51.520
She doesn't give a shit about us.
She's twisting your head, Martin.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.720
You can't trust her.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.200
What are you doing, Simone?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.680
Don't tell that bitch anything.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.560
Martin! Boys!

10:29.640 --> 10:31.040
We have to whack them!

10:32.640 --> 10:33.760
I told you.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.120
-Did they talk?
-No, they haven't.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.280
Hey, do him first.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.640
The tattooed guy.

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
Why?

10:41.800 --> 10:42.680
Just because.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.800
Everyone go to the car.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.480
Yes, come on.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.280
-You promised not to kill them.
-Come, goddamn it.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.960
Are you okay, Jean?

11:24.160 --> 11:25.080
Get in the car.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.240
Let's get the others.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.000
Go.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.520
Where are we going?

12:13.880 --> 12:15.080
Lilla Bjärred.

12:16.440 --> 12:17.440
What the fuck is that?

12:18.520 --> 12:19.520
A town.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.120
Lilla Bjärred.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.920
Sounds like something you do on the can.
I'm gonna go dump a little Bjärred.

12:38.840 --> 12:39.880
You okay?

12:42.240 --> 12:43.800
They didn't have to die.

12:45.360 --> 12:49.800
No. But we can't be on our best behavior
if it ends up killing us, can we?

12:49.880 --> 12:51.880
No, but you gotta start somewhere.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.720
They deserved to die, Simone.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.160
Hi.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.440
Good morning.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.920
Did you sleep well?

13:47.840 --> 13:48.720
Yes.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.200
Are you hungry?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.440
Yes. I'm starving.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.440
She wants to know where your family is.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.160
I don't know.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.040
I haven't seen them since the rain.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.480
-It was delicious.
-Good.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.000
-I'd better...
-Sure.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.560
He says he'd better be on his way.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.360
She really wants you to stay.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.320
I'm afraid I can't.

14:36.880 --> 14:41.080
-Stay as long as you want to.
-Yes, we've got plenty of room.

14:46.920 --> 14:47.960
I'd like that.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.560
Great.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.000
J...

15:05.320 --> 15:06.160
E...

15:09.080 --> 15:09.920
N...

15:12.520 --> 15:13.360
V...

15:26.400 --> 15:27.240
L...

15:28.280 --> 15:29.120
Vilde.

15:29.840 --> 15:30.680
Jean.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.040
And Vilde.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.880
Are you okay, Rasmus?

15:55.960 --> 15:58.520
The doctor should be somewhere
around here.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.080
Rasmus, can you hear me? We are here.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.560
-Rasmus?
-Where is it? Where is that doctor?

16:06.880 --> 16:08.760
-Lea?
-Yes?

16:08.840 --> 16:09.960
Hand me the drone.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.160
Come, my friend.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.200
-It is not working.
-Then we have to make it work.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.960
The drone must send information
to a receiver.

16:17.040 --> 16:17.880
Jean?

16:18.400 --> 16:19.600
The map.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.680
He's really not well.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.400
-Is there a connection button?
-No...

16:26.480 --> 16:28.760
There's a button here.

16:28.840 --> 16:29.960
How about this one?

16:30.520 --> 16:31.360
Here.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.040
Press them simultaneously.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.720
One, two, three.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.720
-Anything happen?
-Yes.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.360
Okay.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.160
-Yes.
-Throw it.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.120
Yes, that's it.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.120
It's working.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.720
-That's us. We're right here.
-Yes.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.680
-There's someone there.
-That could be the doctor.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.240
-It's not far.
-Let's go.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.880
Hello?

17:31.160 --> 17:32.520
Hello. Anybody here?

17:35.760 --> 17:36.600
Stop!

17:38.440 --> 17:39.360
Go away!

17:40.560 --> 17:43.440
I'm sorry, but it's my brother...

17:44.360 --> 17:47.480
-You're a doctor, right?
-Who sent you?

17:47.880 --> 17:49.680
-A man...
-Where did you get that?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.240
We found it.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.480
Who are you?

17:54.560 --> 17:57.600
We just need help, and you can help.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.480
I don't know what you're on about.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.000
-Go!
-We're not leaving.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.360
If you can... you'll help.

18:09.000 --> 18:09.840
What happened?

18:11.080 --> 18:12.600
He's been stabbed in the stomach.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.400
He needs a surgeon or he'll die.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.720
Bring him inside.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.000
Thanks.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.040
Will he be okay?

18:43.680 --> 18:45.000
Have you treated many?

18:47.040 --> 18:48.760
I try to help anyone I can...

18:55.720 --> 18:56.800
Do you live here?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.040
I move around.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.240
Havn't you got any family?

19:05.600 --> 19:06.560
I had one.

19:08.880 --> 19:09.840
They died?

19:11.520 --> 19:14.840
A husband and two children,
a little younger than you.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.440
The rain took them.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.200
Jean...

19:45.400 --> 19:46.840
it's gonna be all right.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.760
It's gonna be all right.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.520
No...

20:17.000 --> 20:18.400
I can't make it work.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.880
Nothing works anymore.

20:21.240 --> 20:24.440
Whether it's cars, the roads, electronics.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.560
Daddy's gonna check it out.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.840
Jean, stay with her.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.560
No!

21:46.720 --> 21:49.920
You killed him! You killed him!

21:51.520 --> 21:53.200
You killed my husband!

21:53.640 --> 21:54.480
No!

21:55.160 --> 21:56.000
Get off!

21:58.400 --> 22:01.160
You killed him! Let me go!

22:26.040 --> 22:26.960
Vilde?

22:28.880 --> 22:29.800
Vilde.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.560
Vilde, wake up.

22:32.640 --> 22:33.600
Hello?

22:35.920 --> 22:36.760
Hello!

23:05.000 --> 23:06.120
Is everything okay?

23:07.600 --> 23:09.760
Yes, he's almost done.

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
What about her?

23:12.920 --> 23:13.920
The doctor?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.040
Simone.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.400
She'll make it, too.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.560
Why do you ask?

23:22.960 --> 23:25.000
You could learn a thing or two
from Rasmus.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.280
Okay.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.280
And what might that be?

23:31.280 --> 23:32.880
To express your feelings.

23:33.840 --> 23:34.800
Funny.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.360
Every time I try to express
my feelings to you, you won't listen.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.600
Where are you headed now?

23:52.520 --> 23:53.480
Norrköping.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.520
I see.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.240
What's there?

24:00.600 --> 24:03.400
-Our dad.
-What's your dad doing in Norrköping?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.520
He works for Apollon.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.240
What's your dad's name?

24:09.320 --> 24:10.360
Frederik.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.760
Frederik Andersen.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.920
We're not quite done yet after all.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.560
-No more stitches, I hope.
-No.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.840
But you need a tetanus shot.

24:28.640 --> 24:31.000
I haven't got it here, but close by.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.600
That's really nice of you.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.440
You're whole again?

24:38.520 --> 24:40.800
-I'm all stitched up.
-Let's get going then.

24:40.880 --> 24:45.160
-Rasmus just needs a shot.
-Just stay here. Have some tea.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.840
-Do you want me to come with you?
-No, we'll be right back.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.560
-Sure?
-Yes.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.440
-You'd rather go with her?
-Oh, cut it out.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.440
Go have some tea.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.640
<i>Right over here.</i>

25:06.560 --> 25:07.800
Easy, Rasmus.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.880
What is this place?

25:16.400 --> 25:17.840
You have access to that?

25:21.560 --> 25:23.840
-You work for Apollon?
-Used to.

25:23.920 --> 25:27.040
-Did you know our dad?
-No, we weren't in the same department.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.240
But you must have known him.
He was one of the first employed.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.720
I didn't know your dad.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.520
-Come on.
-But...

25:34.600 --> 25:37.960
Stop it, Simone. I juts need that shot
and we'll move on.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.520
She's helping us.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.520
Why did they build the barracks
and everything around them?

25:59.880 --> 26:01.560
For the patrols.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.560
The Strangers?

26:07.200 --> 26:08.320
Sit down.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.240
Yes.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.600
What were the Strangers doing here?

26:25.840 --> 26:26.920
There.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.280
-This is just to keep you still.
-Okay.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.320
Division 45.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.560
Yes.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.200
What about it?

26:37.840 --> 26:40.520
-Simone.
-It said that on the access screen.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.280
-Simone.
-And?

26:43.040 --> 26:44.360
My dad worked there.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.320
-No! Let her go!
-Your dad killed my children.

26:49.040 --> 26:49.880
Simone!

26:51.120 --> 26:52.200
Let her go!

26:52.600 --> 26:55.840
-What's keeping them?
-All we ever do is wait for them.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.120
They'll be here. Okay?

26:58.200 --> 26:59.560
Let see what she's got.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.480
You're going to rob her?

27:01.560 --> 27:02.400
Why not?

27:03.080 --> 27:04.560
She's helping us.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.040
Let's just take a look around.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.280
I've had it. Let's go.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.440
-Where?
-We'll find the others.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.680
No, you're staying here.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.400
-Take Simone's backpack.
-Beatrice, you're staying.

27:17.480 --> 27:18.360
Are you coming?

27:20.040 --> 27:22.120
-Come on, Jean.
-Jean, come here.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.560
Come, Jean. Come.

27:23.640 --> 27:24.760
Jean, come now.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.240
Jean, come.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.640
I'm gonna find some food.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.760
Be back in ten.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.560
I haven't got a watch.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.560
Is it good?

27:44.720 --> 27:46.280
Well? Is there anything?

27:46.360 --> 27:47.560
Good stuff.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.920
Fuck. Unbelievable.

28:06.000 --> 28:06.920
Fuck.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.640
Guys... we need to get out.

28:13.720 --> 28:14.680
What's going on?

28:15.280 --> 28:16.480
We need to go now.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.720
What was that?

28:34.160 --> 28:37.120
-Why didn't you shoot them? You promised.
-We have to leave.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.600
-What's going on, Martin?
-I'll explain later.

28:39.680 --> 28:43.200
Jean, what the fuck are you doing?

28:43.280 --> 28:44.400
-Fuck you!
-Jean!

28:46.000 --> 28:49.680
Why the fuck didn't you shoot them?
Why didn't you shoot them?

28:49.760 --> 28:51.600
They must have tracked the car.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.120
Martin, why didn't you shoot them?

28:57.720 --> 28:58.600
No. Fuck.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.040
-Hey! Hello!
-Don't do that.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.720
What the fuck is he doing?

29:01.800 --> 29:04.000
Hey. No, don't shoot.

29:07.840 --> 29:08.680
What was that?

29:09.720 --> 29:10.560
Jean!

29:11.120 --> 29:13.000
Run! Just run!

29:13.080 --> 29:15.480
Come on, Jean! Fuck!

29:16.040 --> 29:16.920
Move.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.280
Martin. Goddamn it!

29:23.840 --> 29:26.920
We have to go. We have to go. Come on.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.360
-We have to go.
-What are you doing?

29:29.440 --> 29:31.320
-Hurry.
-We need to bring him along.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.560
-Martin, listen.
-We need to get him.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.760
Let's go. Down here. Come on.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.160
Where's Jean?

29:51.800 --> 29:54.680
-What's going on?
-He's dead. He's dead.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.800
What's going on?

29:56.120 --> 29:58.760
-Where's Jean?
-The Strangers are here.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.360
-Where's Jean?
-We have to find the others and move on.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.120
-And leave him behind?
-Come on. Run!

30:03.200 --> 30:04.840
Where's...? Where's Jean?

30:07.600 --> 30:11.360
I don't know what you want
or who you think we are.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.560
-Your dad did this.
-What are you talking about?

30:15.040 --> 30:17.000
I told them it was dangerous,

30:17.080 --> 30:20.000
you can't attack nature
and not expect it to strike back,

30:20.080 --> 30:21.240
but they wouldn't listen.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.360
Neither him nor Sten.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.200
They wouldn't listen.

30:27.920 --> 30:31.120
He killed my children.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.400
My...? My dad?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.880
No. No, my dad wouldn't kill anyone.

30:38.960 --> 30:41.960
You have no idea
what your dad's capable of.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.080
No.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.440
I want him to see
what I'm going to do to you.

30:50.360 --> 30:52.000
You won't get out of here.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.840
It's going to hurt...
but it'll be over fast.

30:58.680 --> 30:59.880
Why are you doing this?

31:01.800 --> 31:04.800
You don't know
what it feels like to be lonely.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.440
You can't kill us.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.440
You don't know anything.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.360
They must be here.

31:18.440 --> 31:21.520
No matter what you think our dad's done...

31:23.200 --> 31:25.920
me and Rasmus haven't done anything.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.640
Lie still!

31:30.720 --> 31:31.680
I'll get them.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.600
I understand. I know how much it hurts.

31:43.880 --> 31:44.880
Our mom is dead, too.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.840
We can't undo it.

31:50.720 --> 31:51.840
They're not coming back.

31:57.560 --> 32:00.440
That's the way we do it from now on.
No more talk. Let's go.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.240
What the fuck are you doing?

32:06.320 --> 32:09.800
Trying to help you, okay? Get up.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.960
Simone. Goddamn, Simone.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.600
Let's get out of here. Come on.

32:22.520 --> 32:25.760
-Are you okay?
-What's going on? What the fuck happened?

32:26.600 --> 32:28.520
The doctor stays here.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.240
Let's get out of here.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.000
Come. Let's go.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.480
Let's see if we can stay the night here.

33:34.920 --> 33:35.880
Patrick?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.280
Why didn't you shoot them?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.880
I did what I thought was right.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.600
You did nothing.

33:55.320 --> 33:59.040
If you had shot the Strangers,
they would not have killed Jean.

33:59.720 --> 34:02.560
-We don't know that he's dead.
-Of course he is.

34:03.160 --> 34:06.960
I have followed you for six years,
done anything you asked me to.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.679
-And now you do anything Simone asks?
-Patrick.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.560
Why don't you listen to anything I say?

34:11.639 --> 34:14.199
-Does she own you now?
-Are you through?

34:16.360 --> 34:19.360
It was your decision not to help him.

34:19.920 --> 34:20.760
That's right.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.760
Jean is your cross to bear.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.719
Damn it!

35:20.200 --> 35:21.440
Is that your family?

35:28.040 --> 35:28.880
Come.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.000
You can come with us.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.680
You should have killed them.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.400
The Strangers.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.160
No.
