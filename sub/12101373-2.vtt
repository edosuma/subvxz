[ominous music playing]

00:42.583 --> 00:45.875
[man] I don't know.
Boss is pushing my team the hardest.

00:45.958 --> 00:48.375
Wants the harvesters running doubles.

00:48.458 --> 00:51.333
[woman] You think he's hard on you
because we're not from here?

00:51.416 --> 00:54.583
I doubt he gives a shit where we're from.

00:54.666 --> 00:56.833
The proles on my shift do.

00:56.916 --> 01:00.500
Don't like having an extro for a manager.

01:00.583 --> 01:03.458
Fletcher, have you made friends
with any local kids?

01:03.541 --> 01:06.333
Yeah. Been hanging out with a few of them.

01:06.416 --> 01:09.666
Talk kind of strange.
But other than that, they seem cool.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.375
-They're all modded like me.
-What about Sedgewick?

01:12.458 --> 01:15.416
-Has he made any friends?
-[Fletcher] I, um--

01:15.500 --> 01:19.125
-I don't really know, Mom.
-[father] Right. Of course, he hasn't.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.083
Fletcher, can you keep an eye
on him for me?

01:22.166 --> 01:24.708
-You know how he is.
-[father] He needs to learn to adapt.

01:24.791 --> 01:25.875
[mother] You're too hard on him.

01:25.958 --> 01:29.791
Poor kid's the only unmodded 16-year-old
for a hundred light-years.

01:29.875 --> 01:31.250
-[dishes clatter]
-[father] Bullshit.

01:31.333 --> 01:35.291
It's about character or lack of it.

01:35.375 --> 01:38.541
-No amount of modding would fix that.
-[mother] Not his fault.

01:38.625 --> 01:42.000
Dumped onto a frostbit,
fucking colony world.

01:42.083 --> 01:43.416
[father scoffs] Not his fault.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.583
[mother] I know he can be difficult,
but maybe if you--

01:45.666 --> 01:48.166
[father]
Sedgewick's always had it too easy.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.583
How is he gonna learn to adapt
if he doesn't even try?

02:07.291 --> 02:08.541
[Sedgewick] I'm coming with you.

02:08.625 --> 02:12.333
-Not a good idea, Sedge.
-What, you think I'm afraid?

02:12.416 --> 02:13.958
No, I just don't--

02:14.041 --> 02:17.416
Look, I know everything's
so fucking easy for you.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.875
But don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.375
Look, I know it bothers you
for some reason that--

02:24.458 --> 02:25.708
"Some reason"?

02:25.791 --> 02:27.083
You know what it feels like,

02:27.166 --> 02:29.750
always having my little brother
be better than me?

02:29.833 --> 02:32.083
-Not my fault.
-Then we move to this fucking ice ball,

02:32.166 --> 02:34.333
and every kid's modded like you.

02:34.416 --> 02:38.041
"Different." That's what the grownups say,
but they mean "better."

02:39.541 --> 02:40.916
Fine.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.333
If you're coming,
hurry up and get dressed.

Hey, Sedge, check it out.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.750
[Sedgewick]
Quit screwing around. It'll scan you.

03:07.166 --> 03:08.208
Whatever.

Hey, Logan.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.041
-[Fletcher chuckles]
-[Logan] Who's that?

-He-- He wanted to see the Frostwhales.
-[group laughs]

04:20.833 --> 04:25.916
Okay. So... you run fast, extro?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.333

05:04.041 --> 05:05.291
-What's that mean?
-[Oxo chuckles]

05:05.375 --> 05:08.250
It means fucking big, extro!

05:08.333 --> 05:12.791
Big enough to eat you up, one bite.

05:18.708 --> 05:19.541
You scared?

05:20.708 --> 05:21.875
Fuck off, Brume.

[Brume laughing]

05:34.375 --> 05:35.625
[Logan] Okay, stop.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.291
Whales don't like the machines.

05:39.375 --> 05:41.666
The sound. Too much.

05:41.750 --> 05:44.458
Once they are off the ice, then...
[speaks in foreign language]

05:44.541 --> 05:46.916
Frostwhales, up.

05:47.666 --> 05:50.916
Fucking danger. Okay?

05:52.166 --> 05:54.000
Whales break ice for breathing.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.708
They won't stop till they breach.

05:57.583 --> 06:00.583
They always hit seven times.

06:00.666 --> 06:02.708
[speaking foreign language] Seven.

06:02.791 --> 06:05.208
Minimum... seven.

06:05.291 --> 06:09.333
When Frostwhales hit, we run from here...

06:10.833 --> 06:11.875
to there.

Got it, Fletch?

Uh, yeah. Right.
