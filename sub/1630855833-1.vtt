00:02.503 --> 00:04.211
<i> Linda:</i>
<i>So, everyone enjoying the dinner</i>

00:04.296 --> 00:05.879
Your father and I
nicely made you?

00:05.965 --> 00:07.923
Don't be afraid
to shout out compliments.

00:08.092 --> 00:09.341
Tina:
Oh, sorry. It's really good.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.301
-Thank you.
-It's chicken, right?

00:11.345 --> 00:12.886
- Yes, tina.
-I knew it.

00:13.014 --> 00:15.472
Sorry, mom, I'm just still
sort of reeling from school,

00:15.558 --> 00:17.766
Where my grape-flavored
finger pop-pet

00:17.893 --> 00:19.309
Was cruelly taken from me!

00:19.437 --> 00:21.603
Yeah, you've mentioned
the finger candy thing.

00:21.731 --> 00:23.063
Finger pop-pet!

00:23.107 --> 00:24.940
Whoops. Hey.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.276
-No candy in class.
-But I wasn't eating it.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.727
Then why does it look
half-eaten?

00:28.821 --> 00:30.696
Because I've been savoring it,

00:30.823 --> 00:32.156
Slowly and responsibly.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.158
Well, I'm gonna savor
doing this.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.909
Louise: No, no, no, no, no, no!
Not the trash, no...

00:36.037 --> 00:38.370
And that's why grown-ups
are monsters.

00:38.497 --> 00:41.540
Okay. Uh, sorry
about that, louise,

00:41.667 --> 00:44.793
But, uh, kids,
we wanted to talk to you

00:44.879 --> 00:46.378
-About something.
-Right.

00:46.464 --> 00:48.964
Are we all getting
matching jumpsuits finally?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.007
-No.
-(gene groans)

00:50.134 --> 00:51.508
So, uh, starting tomorrow,

00:51.635 --> 00:54.762
Your father and I
thought it would be good

00:54.889 --> 00:58.265
And also re-really fun
to do chores.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.059
-Chores?
-Didn't we try those before

01:00.144 --> 01:02.061
And we were all like, "nah"?

01:02.146 --> 01:03.353
Uh, we're-we're gonna
try it again.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.272
Yep, you're gonna
clean the bathroom,

01:05.357 --> 01:08.108
Vacuum the floors,
dust... Stuff.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.778
Um, are we getting a raise
in our very meager allowance

01:10.863 --> 01:12.529
Because of these
so-called chores?

01:12.615 --> 01:14.490
Yeah! I mean, yeah.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.991
No. I think the reward

01:16.077 --> 01:18.452
Is that you are contributing
to this family.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.788
And learning that
it's important to pitch in

01:20.873 --> 01:23.373
In society and stuff like that.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.542
You know, we do work
in the restaurant.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.336
Every day. For free.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.546
Not that any of us have called
child welfare or anything.

01:29.632 --> 01:30.798
Except for that one time.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.216
I didn't love that you did that.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.634
But the guy we talked to
was nice.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.469
Oh, yeah. Todd. What's he up to?

01:35.596 --> 01:38.180
Where is all this chore stuff
coming from, anyway?

01:38.224 --> 01:39.973
-Npr?
-Well, if you must know,

01:40.101 --> 01:42.810
I was talking to grandma gloria
the other day

01:42.895 --> 01:44.978
And she reminded me
that they made me and gayle

01:45.064 --> 01:47.272
Do chores every weekend
when we were growing up.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.316
And she thought we should
be doing it with you kids.

01:49.485 --> 01:51.110
She actually thought
we already were,

01:51.195 --> 01:52.903
And I said we tried,
but it didn't really stick

01:52.947 --> 01:54.729
And then she made
that "hmph" sound.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.948
Ugh, grandma gloria.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.574
No huggies from genie
for a year.

01:57.701 --> 02:01.703
All right. Well, what if
we refuse to do these chores?

02:01.747 --> 02:03.622
-Yeah.
-Respectfully?

02:03.666 --> 02:06.625
Okay, well, then,
I would respectfully say

02:06.710 --> 02:08.252
You don't have a choice.

02:08.379 --> 02:10.337
-Right, bob?
-Uh, uh, right.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.673
Well, then,
we're going to respectfully

02:12.800 --> 02:14.091
Stop eating our vegetables.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.343
Gene, tina? Want to stop
eating your broccoli?

02:16.428 --> 02:17.678
(whispering):
But I like broccoli.

02:17.763 --> 02:18.971
-Tina!
-Right, sorry.

02:19.098 --> 02:20.681
(normal volume):
Well, then, you are respectfully

02:20.766 --> 02:21.807
Not getting any dessert.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.560
-Damn it!
-Okay, then we are respectfully

02:24.728 --> 02:26.478
-Not doing our homework.
-Ooh.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.397
You're gonna play
this game with mama?

02:28.524 --> 02:29.857
Oh, yeah.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.025
Oh, good.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.654
(whispering):
But lin, "no tv"

02:35.739 --> 02:38.448
-Means<i> we</i> don't get to watch tv.
-Show no weakness.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.534
-They're gonna crack.
-What if they don't crack?

02:40.619 --> 02:41.827
I'm worried
they're not cracking.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.203
<i> Louise (normal volume):</i>
<i> Mm-mmm. Nope.</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:44.621
-Not brushing them.
-(groans)

02:44.665 --> 02:45.914
-Bob: Mm.
-And if we get painful cavities,

02:46.083 --> 02:48.876
-We'll be the ones laughing.
-Yeah. Wait.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.335
<i> Linda:</i>
<i> Okay, early bedtime,</i>

02:50.421 --> 02:52.671
In your room, lights out, now.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.965
-Nuh-uh. Not going to bed.
-Until we get tired.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.166
-Yeah.
-Guys.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.759
-I mean, never.
-Right.

02:57.887 --> 03:00.137
-Okay, then, no...
-What?

03:00.264 --> 03:01.597
-No...
-You got nothing.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.807
No, no christmas ever again!

03:03.893 --> 03:06.810
Uh, linda, want to have
a quick chat?

03:06.896 --> 03:09.313
I feel like it's not going well.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.064
What-what if I go buy
a bag of candy

03:11.150 --> 03:12.357
And we give them candy

03:12.443 --> 03:13.942
-If they do the chores?
-No, bob.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.485
They should do chores
'cause we told them to

03:15.571 --> 03:17.362
And 'cause it'll make them
better people in society

03:17.448 --> 03:18.947
And all that crap,
not to get candy.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.325
I mean, what if they turn
into little delinquents

03:21.410 --> 03:24.578
Who won't listen to authority
and it-it ruins their lives?

03:24.663 --> 03:27.247
Then we'll just pretend
we don't know them?

03:27.374 --> 03:28.290
Hmm. Maybe.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.750
Well, the kids
have to go to bed.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.294
So, we need a cease-fire,
I think.

03:32.338 --> 03:34.463
(sighs)
okay, fine. You're right.

03:34.590 --> 03:36.131
Eh, we'll-we'll put a pin
in the chores thing

03:36.258 --> 03:38.342
And figure out a way
to make them do them tomorrow.

03:38.469 --> 03:39.635
Blackmail, maybe?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.470
Have you been writing
stuff down? I haven't.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.055
-(groans)
-kids.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.932
Come in here. Come on.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.808
-Okay.
-Hmm.

03:46.936 --> 03:49.186
I'm sorry about
that "no christmas" thing.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.146
Come on. Come up
in the bed with mama.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.273
-Come on.
-Are you gonna kill us?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.483
No.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.027
Let's, uh, revisit
the chores thing later.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.238
Why don't we all
just relax, huh?

03:59.365 --> 04:01.490
(yawns)
so tired, right?

04:01.533 --> 04:03.784
-No.
-Yes. Should we sing
a nice song

04:03.869 --> 04:06.662
Or tell a bedtime story? Huh?

04:06.789 --> 04:08.372
A bedtime story?
Like you guys used to do?

04:08.457 --> 04:10.707
-Back when we were children?
-Oh, yeah, dad,

04:10.793 --> 04:13.794
You used to tell that story
about pepperoni the sleepy pony.

04:13.996 --> 04:16.004
-Oh, right.
-Aw, pepperoni.

04:16.131 --> 04:19.007
Roaming the plains, looking
for a nice place to sleep.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.634
-And a little pepperoni.
-Gene: Aren't we all?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.177
Tell that story, bob.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.513
Okay. Um, I think I remember it.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.349
-But maybe he's not sleepy.
-And maybe he's really buff?

04:27.434 --> 04:30.143
But also super humble.
About how buff he is.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.312
But he's still into pepperoni.

04:32.398 --> 04:33.647
Uh, okay, so,

04:33.732 --> 04:36.984
<i> Pepperoni the super buff pony</i>
<i> wanders around,</i>

04:37.069 --> 04:40.070
<i> Looking for a place</i>
<i> to, um, not sleep.</i>

04:40.239 --> 04:42.239
<i> And he ends up in a town.</i>

04:42.366 --> 04:44.408
<i> It was a small mining town</i>

04:44.493 --> 04:47.536
<i> -Called w-western-ville.</i>
<i> -Linda: Oh, that's good.</i>

04:47.621 --> 04:49.079
<i> Bob:</i>
<i> And there were three siblings</i>
<i> that lived there,</i>

04:49.206 --> 04:51.164
<i> The belch-earps.</i>

04:51.250 --> 04:52.791
<i> The-the bearps.</i>

04:52.876 --> 04:54.167
<i> And they operated</i>
<i> the town's tavern.</i>

04:54.253 --> 04:55.585
<i> The youngest ran the bar</i>

04:55.671 --> 04:56.962
<i> And the gambling side</i>
<i> of things...</i>

04:57.089 --> 04:58.630
<i> Louise:</i>
<i> Oh, and give me giant boots</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:00.090
<i> With huge spurs on the back.</i>

05:00.175 --> 05:03.051
<i> -And the front.</i>
<i> -Bob: Uh, okay, sure.</i>

05:03.137 --> 05:04.761
<i> A-and the middle one</i>
<i> ran the entertainment.</i>

05:04.847 --> 05:06.638
<i> Gene:</i>
<i> And I have one of those</i>
<i> player pianos.</i>

05:06.724 --> 05:08.181
<i> But I can carry it around.</i>

05:08.225 --> 05:10.058
<i> Bob:</i>
<i>You carry around a player piano?</i>

05:10.185 --> 05:12.394
-Yeah, because
it's cutting-edge.
-All right.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.813
<i> Uh, and the oldest</i>
<i> runs the hotel and stables.</i>

05:14.898 --> 05:17.357
<i> Tina:</i>
<i> Well, more of a horse hotel</i>
<i>that also has rooms for people.</i>

05:17.484 --> 05:18.567
Right this way, sir.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.652
<i> -It's classy.</i>
<i> -Linda: (clears throat)</i>

05:20.779 --> 05:23.322
<i> And, uh, maybe there's some</i>
<i> nice sheriffs in this town.</i>

05:23.407 --> 05:25.282
<i> -M-married sheriffs.</i>
<i> -Bob: Uh, okay.</i>

05:25.367 --> 05:27.743
<i> Linda:</i>
<i>Yeah, and they're really great,</i>
<i> but the townspeople</i>

05:27.870 --> 05:29.995
<i> Don't listen to the sheriffs</i>
<i> because the townspeople</i>

05:30.122 --> 05:32.497
<i> Can be big pains in the butt</i>
<i> sometimes.</i>

05:32.624 --> 05:35.959
But I thought this was supposed
to be a relaxing bedtime story?

05:36.045 --> 05:38.253
-Yeah, so one
of the sheriffs says...
-Yeah.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.213
Hey, bearps,
maybe you could try and keep

05:40.299 --> 05:41.757
Your area nice and clean today?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.175
Hmm, let me think about that.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.843
(blows raspberry)
oh, and also...

05:44.970 --> 05:46.261
-(blows raspberry)
-but I mean,

05:46.347 --> 05:49.348
Maybe you could, you know,
sweep up all the glass?

05:49.433 --> 05:51.683
Um, I think I know
the gambling business, m'kay?

05:51.769 --> 05:54.478
(grunts) it's read 'em and weep,
not read 'em and sweep.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.897
♪<i> and I'm not cleaning up</i>
<i> anything, either</i> ♪

05:56.982 --> 05:59.358
♪<i> in the wild, wild west.</i> ♪

05:59.485 --> 06:02.152
<i> Linda:</i>
<i>They wouldn't listen to anything</i>
<i> the married sheriffs said,</i>

06:02.237 --> 06:03.445
<i> Who were actually a lot older</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:05.489
<i> And smarter</i>
<i> than the townspeople,</i>

06:05.574 --> 06:07.366
<i> But still good-looking</i>
<i> for their age.</i>

06:07.451 --> 06:08.909
But there was a reason
the townspeople

06:08.994 --> 06:10.869
Didn't want to listen
to the married sheriffs.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.579
-No, there wasn't.
-Yes, there was.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.539
-Because one night...
-Hey, you're not telling
the story.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.249
Because one night,

06:16.293 --> 06:18.460
<i> After they ordered</i>
<i>the townspeople to go to bed...</i>

06:18.629 --> 06:20.796
-Linda: Townspeople, go to bed.
-Bob: Yeah.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.214
-Linda: 'cause we're the boss.
-Yeah.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.507
<i> Louise:</i>
<i> And after all the old-timey</i>

06:23.634 --> 06:24.966
<i> Old west lights were out,</i>

06:25.085 --> 06:27.010
<i> The married sheriffs</i>
<i> got on their horses</i>

06:27.096 --> 06:29.054
<i> And they rode off</i>
<i> into the night.</i>

06:29.172 --> 06:30.806
<i> But not everyone went to bed.</i>

06:30.891 --> 06:33.058
<i> The three bearps</i>
<i> followed the sheriffs.</i>

06:33.143 --> 06:34.601
Attaboy, pepperoni.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.187
Three riders on him and
he's not even breaking a sweat.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.814
So buff.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.649
<i> Louise:</i>
<i> They tracked them to the mine</i>
<i> outside of town.</i>

06:40.734 --> 06:43.443
<i> And there, they discovered</i>
<i> that the married sheriffs</i>

06:43.487 --> 06:45.570
<i> Were having a sneaky</i>
<i> nighttime meeting</i>

06:45.656 --> 06:50.200
<i> With owner of the mine and</i>
<i> super rich guy mr. Goldoeder.</i>

06:50.285 --> 06:52.119
Hello. I was just
kissing my gold good night.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.955
So, how's the secret plan
to have those nitwit townspeople

06:55.082 --> 06:57.082
Keep the place
nice and tidy going?

06:57.167 --> 07:00.168
So that big g will be impressed
and want to buy the town,

07:00.295 --> 07:04.131
The mine and all this land,
and we get our big payout?

07:04.216 --> 07:07.008
Wait, what? No, the married
sheriffs are good guys.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.552
Yeah, that's what
they want you to think.

07:08.637 --> 07:11.179
It turns out their intentions
were not so good.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.849
-In fact, they were bad.
-No.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.560
And all to serve
their own greedy purposes.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.145
-No.
-(grunts)

07:18.313 --> 07:20.313
Louise (whispering):
We got to get rid
of the married sheriffs.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.940
-Tina: Yep.
-Gene: The merriffs?
That what I call them.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.733
-(pepperoni sighs)
-gene: Pepperoni likes it.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.364
So, the plan--
the tidy townspeople plan--

07:29.408 --> 07:30.532
Catch me up.
How's it going?

07:30.576 --> 07:31.825
It's going really good.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.244
-It-it's not going good.
-It's not going good.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.704
Well, you two need to get tough.

07:35.831 --> 07:36.955
Maybe make an example
of one of them.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.915
Blast 'em with your
bean blaster.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.459
Like this. Pew!

07:40.627 --> 07:43.170
That's uh, the exact rock
I was aiming to hit.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.838
I should have,
uh, said that beforehand.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.465
Anyway, everything
has to be perfect

07:46.550 --> 07:48.175
For when big g comes.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.260
She does not approve
of messy towns

07:50.387 --> 07:52.179
Or ill-behaved townspeople.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.847
And if big g doesn't approve,

07:53.932 --> 07:55.515
Then she's not gonna buy us out

07:55.601 --> 07:56.808
And we don't get the money,

07:56.852 --> 07:58.810
Which I know
we're all big fans of.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.188
Don't worry, we'll make sure
big g is happy.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.814
(sniffs)
what am I smelling?

08:02.941 --> 08:05.567
Oh, that's me.
I-I don't wash myself.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.152
That's...
(sighs) okay.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.570
So, the townspeople
had to figure out

08:08.697 --> 08:11.448
How to get rid of the terrible,
greedy, smelly sheriffs.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.450
(whispering): What if I just
pop down to the pharmacy

08:13.577 --> 08:15.577
And ask for drugs
that put kids to sleep?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.913
Probably not. But maybe?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.206
(normal volume):
Anyway, the three siblings had

08:19.333 --> 08:20.916
A secret meeting of their own.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.251
<i> Okay, all the townspeople</i>
<i> chipped in.</i>

08:23.295 --> 08:25.128

08:28.217 --> 08:29.925
Weekend here at the inn,

08:29.968 --> 08:31.760
Which includes drinks,
horse massages,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.678
Our finest
pretty-clean chamber pots.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.975
I think we'll just
take the money.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.060
But I like that song.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.062
So, how exactly does the whole

08:42.189 --> 08:44.356
"taking someone and leaving them
in the middle of nowhere"

08:44.483 --> 08:45.357
Business work?

08:45.442 --> 08:46.900
Well, basically
we just take 'em

08:47.069 --> 08:48.777
And then we, uh, leave 'em
in the middle of nowhere.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.945
Louise:
Okay, then.

08:50.072 --> 08:50.946
Yup, with no money,

08:51.114 --> 08:52.322
Uncomfortable walking shoes,

08:52.449 --> 08:54.908
Only, like, a super small
thing of sunscreen.

08:54.993 --> 08:55.742
No podcasts.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.118
Okay, but what if then,

08:57.204 --> 08:59.079
One of the leave-in-
the-middle-of-nowhere guys

08:59.164 --> 09:00.205
Starts asking some questions?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.289
Are you sure you want to

09:01.375 --> 09:02.749
Get rid of the married sheriffs?

09:02.834 --> 09:04.167
I mean, uh I haven't
been here long,

09:04.294 --> 09:05.502
But they seem nice to me.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.045
And-and loving, I want to say?

09:07.130 --> 09:09.714
Yeah, and wise. Like,
they've got all this wisdom

09:09.841 --> 09:11.716
To pass on about life,
and the world...

09:11.802 --> 09:12.676
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.094
They're forcing us to do chores.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.136
-(gasps)
-do what?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.805
No way. You guys seem like

09:16.890 --> 09:18.598
You work so hard all the time.

09:18.725 --> 09:19.808
And you're delightful.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.476
-I know.
-Well, I'm gonna enjoy

09:21.562 --> 09:23.019
Leaving them
in the middle of nowhere.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.230
And maybe only one
bathroom break on the way,

09:25.315 --> 09:26.815
And then, after that,
we'll be like,

09:26.900 --> 09:28.525
-"you got to hold it."
-yeah.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.652
But if we have to go,
we still stop.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.445
I-I have a small bladder.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.947
But a big heart.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.616
Linda (whispering):
Married sheriff bob,

09:36.785 --> 09:38.201
I think something weird
might be going on.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.370
Bob:
Why, 'cause some strangers
threw us on a horse

09:40.455 --> 09:42.163
-And put a blanket over us?
-Yeah.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.623
I'm beginning to think
maybe this isn't

09:43.750 --> 09:45.875
About a surprise
birthday party for us at all.

09:46.003 --> 09:49.045
I mean, for one thing, it's not
anywhere close to our birthdays.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.130
Yeah. Come to think of it,

09:50.215 --> 09:51.548
I was actually the one who said

09:51.633 --> 09:53.341
"is this, like, a surprise
birthday party thing?"

09:53.427 --> 09:54.926
And they said "sure, whatever."

09:55.053 --> 09:56.386
(normal volume):
Ooh, that's bright.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.221
-Where are we?
-The middle of nowhere.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.723
-What town is that near?
-None.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.683
-This is your stop.
-Aah!
-Aah!

10:01.727 --> 10:04.728
Can we have our bean blasters
back? No reason. Also,

10:04.846 --> 10:07.647
Can you maybe give us
your bean blasters? No reason.

10:07.733 --> 10:08.815
-Nope.
-Bob: Fair enough.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.317
And don't you start
pleading with us

10:10.402 --> 10:11.818
Not to leave you here
'cause we don't feel

10:11.987 --> 10:13.236
Emotionally compromised
about this at all.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.405
Uh, please don't leave us here?

10:15.532 --> 10:16.740
-Dang it!
-Please!

10:16.867 --> 10:18.366
I'm not wearing
the right bra for this.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.076
Sorry. Best of luck.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.454
Are they still looking at us?

10:22.539 --> 10:24.914
Uh, let me check. Yeah.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.082
Do they look po'd?

10:26.209 --> 10:27.834
Pretty-pretty po'd.

10:27.919 --> 10:28.960
How about now?

10:29.046 --> 10:31.880
-Hmm. Look still pretty upset.
-Aw, man.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.173
Jimmy jr.:
Hey, cheer up. Let's go get you

10:33.342 --> 10:35.050
-A western omelet.
-Zeke: Okay.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.135
So the married sheriffs
got what they deserved.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.137
-The end. What a great story.
-I mean,

10:39.306 --> 10:41.014
-The structure's
a little all over the place...
-Linda: Up, bup, bup.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.475
That's not the end.
No, no, no. You know why?

10:43.518 --> 10:44.934
Gene:
Because nobody's kissed yet?

10:45.103 --> 10:47.103
Because the married sheriffs
didn't give up.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.356
They weren't gonna let
those punky townspeople win.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.316
Not that it was about
winning or losing.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.527
No, it was.
So, they started walking.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.946

to get back to the townspeople

11:12.839 --> 11:14.172

and watch over them.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.342

A baby gave it to me.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.689
Just kidding, I had it made.
By a baby.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.193
You're going down.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.571
Uh, can I go against
someone else?

15:06.698 --> 15:09.407
Maybe someone, uh,
less I-intimidating?

15:09.534 --> 15:10.408
Maybe the lawyer?

15:10.535 --> 15:11.826
-Hey.
-Nope.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.037
Okay, I-I just...

15:16.625 --> 15:17.749
My butt's out, isn't it?

15:17.834 --> 15:19.542
-It is.
-Disgusting!

15:19.628 --> 15:20.877
Well, that's not fair.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.004
Also, louise, why would
my butt flap be open?

15:23.173 --> 15:24.297
Wouldn't it be closed?

15:24.382 --> 15:26.090
Oh, they don't invent
closing butt flaps

15:26.176 --> 15:27.258
For another 50 years.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.551
Everybody, just listen.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.677
Mom, I didn't
get to the part

15:29.763 --> 15:30.887
Where you shoot gene's belt off

15:31.014 --> 15:32.931
-And his butt is hanging out.
-Nice.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.601
Why?! Why?! No!

15:36.686 --> 15:38.394
(weakly): Ashes to ashes.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.229
Butt to butt.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.106
Wait. Did I die?

15:42.233 --> 15:43.608
No, you were just
being dramatic.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.817
Got it. Continue.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.694
How did I do, louise?
Pretty good?

15:47.906 --> 15:49.155
Get ready for me to,

15:49.240 --> 15:50.949
Um, shoot you with...

15:51.076 --> 15:52.825
Oh, you won.

15:52.911 --> 15:53.743
So, not great.

15:53.828 --> 15:54.827
<i> Louise:</i>
<i> Then it was time</i>

15:54.955 --> 15:56.454
<i> To find out who would face off</i>

15:56.539 --> 15:57.789
<i> With goldoeder</i>
<i> in the final round.</i>

15:57.916 --> 15:59.082
<i> And that's</i>
<i> when goldoeder decided</i>

15:59.167 --> 16:00.708
<i> To make it more interesting.</i>

16:00.794 --> 16:02.210
Let's make it more interesting.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.544
Now that we're down
to the real-deal

16:03.630 --> 16:05.004
Head honchos around here,

16:05.131 --> 16:07.873
Why don't we switch to
the real-deal bean.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.217
Lima.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.134
(gasping)

16:10.261 --> 16:12.053
You can't be serious.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.808
But lima beans are huge.
And they hurt like hell.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.309
And they taste okay at best.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.728
I mean, if you sauté them
with a little butter...

16:20.814 --> 16:21.896
-Bob, shush.
-Dad, shh.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.606
-Sorry.
-And married sheriff linda said:

16:23.692 --> 16:26.526
I can't believe you're about
to blast me with a lima bean.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.735
<i> Louise:</i>
<i> And louise said:</i>

16:27.862 --> 16:29.278
I can't believe<i> you're</i> about to

16:29.406 --> 16:30.571
Blast<i> me</i> with a lima bean.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.241
Just do the frickin' chores.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.742
No frickin' way.

16:34.869 --> 16:38.538
Aah! Why can't you just do
something when I ask you to?

16:38.623 --> 16:41.541
I'm in charge and I know
what's best for you.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.501
It's like you don't
respect me at all,

16:43.628 --> 16:46.379
Even though everything I do,
I do it for you.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.880
Okay, bryan adams.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.257
Sorry. Not doing them.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.301
Ugh! It's so frustrating!

16:52.387 --> 16:54.012
(sniffs) you know what?
Forget it.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.431
Forget everything, I don't care.
I don't care what you do.

16:56.558 --> 16:57.807
(sniffs)

16:57.892 --> 17:01.477
Are you crying?
During a quick draw competition?

17:01.563 --> 17:02.937
No, I'm fine.

17:03.064 --> 17:06.190
Just, I'm in charge
and I'm fine. I'm fine.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.151
Uh-oh. Uh, hey, everyone,

17:08.236 --> 17:11.070
Uh, look at, uh,
pepperoni the pony.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.488
(clucks tongue)

17:12.574 --> 17:15.533
-So hot.
-It's not all about
you, pepperoni.

17:15.618 --> 17:16.993
(cries) it's not...

17:17.078 --> 17:20.038
Uh, do I... Win?

17:24.294 --> 17:25.501
Is mom okay? I'm only asking

17:25.587 --> 17:26.961
'cause she ran out
of the room crying.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.671
Maybe it's part of her
nightly beauty regimen

17:28.798 --> 17:30.214
That we just aren't aware of.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.340
If it works, it works.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.384
I'm gonna, uh, go talk to her.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.802
Or maybe I go?

17:34.929 --> 17:36.721
Oh. Uh, okay.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.433
So, anybody have
any fun weekend plans?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.684
-No.
-Okay.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.478
Uh, mom?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.772
Hi. I'm fine.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.148
I just needed to fart,

17:47.233 --> 17:49.150
So I ran out here to fart.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.069
And I'm-I'm not crying,

17:51.196 --> 17:53.863
Even though it's really cool
for moms to get angry

17:53.948 --> 17:55.823
And frustrated and cry
in front of their kids.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.493
I'm sorry I made you not cry.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.911
Now I feel like a jerk.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.579
I just... It's not easy

18:01.664 --> 18:02.914
Having someone bigger than you

18:02.999 --> 18:04.540
Telling you what to do
all the time.

18:04.667 --> 18:05.875
And then that thing at school,

18:05.960 --> 18:08.461
Labonz taking my beautiful
finger pop-pet.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.464
You, uh, you caught me
at a bad time.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.799
I know, I know.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.301
But I just had that
phone call with grandma

18:15.386 --> 18:17.428
And her whole chores spiel
got in my head.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.472
So let's call it
all grandma's fault.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.015
No, we love grandma.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.100
But, yes, sort of.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.559
Also, I mean, one of our chores

18:23.728 --> 18:25.186
Was to light grandpa's cigars.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.063
Like, in our mouths, so...

18:27.190 --> 18:28.397
I can still taste it.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.066
So, maybe she's not
mother of the year.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.234
Well, now she sounds great.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.735
It's just, you know...

18:32.862 --> 18:34.403
It's been so much pressure

18:34.531 --> 18:37.073
Trying to raise good kids.
Good humans.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.534
It can mess you up.
And then I get mad at you guys,

18:39.661 --> 18:41.035
But you're just being kids.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.578
It's-it's just... (sniffs)

18:42.705 --> 18:43.913
You know, it's just a lot.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.290
Mostly 'cause of tina, right?
And gene?

18:46.417 --> 18:47.458
Come here, you.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.877
You know, I'm glad
you're so spunky.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.379
It'll be good for you
when you're older.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.464
Nobody's gonna
push my louise around.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.842
You'll be the toughest little
cutie in prison. (grunts)

18:55.969 --> 18:57.009
-Thanks, mom.
-And I'm still gonna try

18:57.095 --> 18:58.719
-To make you do chores.
-Mmm, never.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.346
-What if I give you candy?
-Deal.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.098
Maybe some of those
finger blasters?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.057
Finger pop-pets.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.642
The candy thing was my idea.

19:04.727 --> 19:05.977
I'd clean the crap out
of this place for some candy.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.062
As usual, candy
solves everything.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.313
Now can we go back
to mom and dad's bed

19:09.440 --> 19:11.357
And finish the story?
I need to know

19:11.442 --> 19:12.984
What happens to that
intriguing piano player.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.944
Does he ever play coachella?

19:15.029 --> 19:16.696
Oh, hurry it up already.

19:16.781 --> 19:17.905
I need to go home
and wash these miners

19:17.991 --> 19:20.992
Before tomorrow.
They're filthy.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.370
What the...

19:24.455 --> 19:26.497
Yeah, we're on
the same side now.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.623
Yeah, deal with it.

19:27.709 --> 19:28.916
-Yay!
-Same sidesies!

19:29.085 --> 19:30.960
Oh, whatever.
I'll just bean you both.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.837
Could you stand just
next to each other?

19:32.922 --> 19:34.463
And-and also stand closer to me?

19:34.549 --> 19:35.798
What is going on?

19:35.967 --> 19:38.217
Oh, big g.
When did you get here?

19:38.303 --> 19:39.260
Just now.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.220
I took a coach
from the train station.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.182
The driver was
very rough with my bags,

19:44.267 --> 19:46.767
And his horses
were way too loud.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.853
Oh, sorry to hear that.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.354
Well, everything's fine, big g.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.608
Just gonna get rid of all these
naughty townspeople real quick

19:53.693 --> 19:54.817
And then I can take you

19:54.944 --> 19:57.153
On a fun tour.
Fyi, the married sheriffs

19:57.280 --> 19:58.487
Are not cool anymore.

19:58.573 --> 20:02.491
Ech. Is nobody doing
any chores around here?

20:02.577 --> 20:03.993
I do not approve.

20:04.162 --> 20:07.413
Well, guess what? That's fine.
You don't have to approve of it.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.540
Louise:
Yeah. Agree to disapprove.

20:09.626 --> 20:12.043
This is our town.
These are our people.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.462
And that tart, onion-y odor
is our smell.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.631
And sure, us sheriffs
may not always do

20:16.758 --> 20:19.592
What we're supposed to do,
but we do what we need to do.

20:19.677 --> 20:20.801
For the good of this town.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.345
And I'm gonna
be a better sheriff

20:22.430 --> 20:23.846
If I listen to my gut,

20:23.890 --> 20:26.724
And not someone else's gut
who doesn't even live here.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.852
And right now,
my gut is telling me

20:29.938 --> 20:31.604
Back off, big g.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.147
Aah!

20:33.233 --> 20:34.398
<i> Bob: Wait, there's a canon?</i>

20:34.567 --> 20:36.067
<i> And I ride it, somehow?</i>

20:36.152 --> 20:37.360
<i> Linda: Yeah, a bean canon.</i>

20:37.487 --> 20:38.903
<i> Bob:</i>
<i> And it's rolling on its own?</i>

20:39.030 --> 20:40.404
<i> Linda:</i>
<i> Well, that's how some canons</i>

20:40.531 --> 20:41.906
<i> Worked back then,</i>
<i> I'm pretty sure.</i>

20:41.991 --> 20:42.907
Psst, hey.

20:42.992 --> 20:43.908
Should we move them?

20:43.993 --> 20:45.451
No, they look so sweet.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.786
We can all fit, right?

20:46.913 --> 20:49.288
Yep. Half my body
is probably fine just floating.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.166
(yawning):
Wait, you forgot something.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.126
-Yeah.
-Oh, right.
