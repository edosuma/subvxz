WEBVTT

00:04.439 --> 00:07.833
- Another Oktoberfest
in the books.

00:07.877 --> 00:09.835
Now how're we
getting home?

00:09.879 --> 00:12.708
Steve doesn't have a license,
I'm hammered, Francine's wasted,

00:12.751 --> 00:14.492
and Hayley's
way too drunk to drive.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.668
How can you tell?

00:16.712 --> 00:20.846
Because when you abuse alcohol,
I like you more as a person.

00:20.890 --> 00:21.891
I can drive!

00:21.934 --> 00:23.588
I stayed sober all night

00:23.632 --> 00:25.416
just so I could be
the designated driver.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.506
What--
What about Jeff?

00:28.550 --> 00:30.943
He can't, remember?

00:30.987 --> 00:33.381
He shattered his legs
in the beer stein race.

00:33.424 --> 00:36.079
Oh, God!
My legs!

00:36.123 --> 00:37.689
Gross!
Get out of here!

00:37.733 --> 00:39.169
Come on, Stan!
Throw me the keys!

00:39.213 --> 00:41.171
Absolutely not.

00:41.215 --> 00:44.044
- What's the problem?
- I already texted Klaus.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.046
He'll get us
home safe.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.787
You guys want Klaus to drive
instead of me?

00:48.831 --> 00:51.181
Heck yeah we [burping] doooo.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.403
Klaus in the house!

00:55.446 --> 00:57.927
More like Klaus in the truck!

00:57.970 --> 00:59.929
Hop in!

00:59.972 --> 01:02.801
Will you please take me
to the ER?

01:02.845 --> 01:04.977
No way.
I'm not wasting my buzz

01:05.021 --> 01:07.763
sitting around
an emergmancy rohm.

01:07.806 --> 01:10.374
But the hospital's
on the way home!

01:10.418 --> 01:12.594
I could've skipped the hospital
just as well as Klaus!

01:12.637 --> 01:14.726
- Oh, please.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.902
Legs heal, but there's
no greater pain

01:16.946 --> 01:19.253
than staying sober
all night for nothing.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.435
<i>♪ Good morning, U.S.A.♪</i>

01:48.717 --> 01:51.807
<i>♪ Good morning, U.S.A.♪</i>

01:54.679 --> 01:58.161
I can't believe none of you
would let me drive last night.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.468
I was so upset
I had to journal about it,

02:00.511 --> 02:02.252
and that's when I realized
none of you

02:02.296 --> 02:04.124
have gotten in a car with me
for the past six months!

02:04.167 --> 02:05.429
Why not?

02:05.473 --> 02:06.996
Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.432
You're the worst driver
in the world.

02:08.476 --> 02:10.347
Hayley, please.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.001
You know how much I love
pointing out Roger's flaws,

02:12.044 --> 02:14.003
but it's best we leave
this to a professional.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.483
That's why I scheduled
an appointment

02:15.526 --> 02:17.137
with our insurance adjustor.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.617
You think I need
my insurance adjusted?

02:19.661 --> 02:22.272
Well, I think you need
your attitude adjusted!

02:28.017 --> 02:31.281
Insurance adjustor
Heinrich Brown?!

02:31.325 --> 02:33.979
Please, come in.
I'll make some room for you.

02:34.023 --> 02:36.156
- Oh, God! My arms!

02:36.199 --> 02:38.158
Thank you, Stan.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.985
I'm here to explain the reasons
Uncle Roger is a threat

02:40.029 --> 02:42.988
to everything I hold dear
as an insurance adjustor.

02:43.032 --> 02:46.209
To do so, I'll be using a form
of street poetry

02:46.253 --> 02:48.168
colloquially known
as "rap."

02:49.865 --> 02:51.910
<i>♪ Get up, unh, unh♪</i>

02:51.954 --> 02:53.825

02:59.744 --> 03:02.225
I'm sorry, I just... can't.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.317
This hardened exterior
is a lie.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.493
I only pretend to be tough
because working in insurance

03:09.537 --> 03:11.234
requires a lot of machismo.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.497
But I need to be honest
with myself.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.759
I don't want to rap.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.370
I want to...

03:16.413 --> 03:19.416
<i>♪ Sing♪</i>

03:20.548 --> 03:23.681
Uncle Roger, frankly,

03:23.725 --> 03:27.903
there should be a hall of fame
for all your accidents.

03:27.946 --> 03:32.124
I heard they were building one
and you drove right through it.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.910
I guess the only thing left
to say is...

03:34.953 --> 03:37.608
All right, here we go!
Full singing!

03:37.652 --> 03:40.263
<i>♪ Roger, you know♪</i>

of people in the basement.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.632

don't believe you.

04:39.366 --> 04:42.020
This song hurts my feelings,
which sucks,

04:42.064 --> 04:44.109
because its already
stuck in my head.

04:44.153 --> 04:47.591
What a fabulous concert.
Is this free?

04:47.635 --> 04:49.506
It feels free
because it's bundled

04:49.550 --> 04:51.334
with your insurance plan.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.162
Free! Free! Free!

04:55.991 --> 04:58.298
<i>Dear Journal,
I hope I can trust you</i>

04:58.341 --> 05:01.605
<i>in the way no one trusts me,
which is a lot!</i>

05:01.649 --> 05:04.608
<i>I'm still upset no one in this
family will let me drive.</i>

05:04.652 --> 05:06.784
Roger, I know this is
a great chance for a joke,

05:06.828 --> 05:08.830
but I want to get
straight to it--

05:08.873 --> 05:11.441
I'm willing to give you
driving lessons.

05:11.485 --> 05:12.877
Hmm.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.358
I guess I'd get to drive
your sick truck.

05:15.402 --> 05:18.796
Yes. But you have to be
extremely careful.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.146
My truck is a highly specific
shade of orange

05:21.190 --> 05:23.975
that's been proven
to cause epileptic seizures,

05:24.019 --> 05:26.369
so they don't make
parts for it anymore.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.850
If you're going to earn
the family's trust back,

05:28.893 --> 05:30.808
you're going to have to show
them you can focus

05:30.852 --> 05:32.157
- while you're driving--
- Hey, look!

05:32.201 --> 05:33.724
A sign!

05:33.768 --> 05:35.335
He's still allowed
to adopt?!

05:37.032 --> 05:38.033
Roger,
goddammit, watch the road!

05:38.076 --> 05:39.817
I can laugh and watch the--

05:40.949 --> 05:42.559
Whee!

05:44.779 --> 05:47.521
You crashed my perfect truck
into that hideous Tesla!

05:47.564 --> 05:49.392
Hmm... Tesla...

05:49.436 --> 05:51.394
You better have good insurance, pal.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.178
Oh, God,
the orange of your truck

05:53.222 --> 05:55.006
is so highly spec--

05:59.141 --> 06:02.231
Tesla...

06:04.886 --> 06:07.367
Roger, why did you invite us
to SoSo's?

06:07.410 --> 06:09.412
Yeah,
this place sucks.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.850
It smells like cheap marinara
and unpaid child support.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.374
And the food...

06:14.417 --> 06:15.897
it tastes...

06:15.940 --> 06:17.681
I wanna say...

06:17.725 --> 06:18.856
bad?

06:18.900 --> 06:20.118
Okay, you guys need to stop

06:20.162 --> 06:21.903
shitting on SoSo's.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.121
All right? This is
a perfectly fine restaurant

06:23.165 --> 06:24.514
for families on a budget.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.907
Then why don't you
eat some?

06:25.950 --> 06:28.300
What?! No!
I don't wanna die!

06:28.344 --> 06:31.216
Speaking of not dying,
I am finally willing to accept

06:31.260 --> 06:33.088
that none of you
want me to drive.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.698
Thank you, Roger.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.439
We appreciate you respecting
our wishes.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.049
Sorry,
you didn't let me finish.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.703
I'm willing to accept
that none of you

06:39.747 --> 06:42.489
want me to drive
on Earth!

07:05.947 --> 07:08.906
Wow! I've heard
about five-star dining,

07:08.950 --> 07:10.560
but this is ridiculous!

07:10.604 --> 07:13.258
Looks like at SoSo's,
it's not just the savings

07:13.302 --> 07:14.825
that are
out of this world!

07:14.869 --> 07:16.784
No, no, I should take
this seriously.

07:16.827 --> 07:20.440
After all, there's a certain
gravity to this situation!

07:20.483 --> 07:22.311
We have fun.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.185
Roger, what the hell
is going on?!

07:27.229 --> 07:28.752
That's a fair question.

07:28.796 --> 07:31.755
See, SoSo's Pizzas
are alien spaceships

07:31.799 --> 07:32.930
placed throughout America

07:32.974 --> 07:34.758
in preparation
for The Reckoning,

07:34.802 --> 07:38.283
which is when an obscure
alien race will destroy humanity

07:38.327 --> 07:40.155
if they ever stop
making <i>Law & Order: SVU.</i>

07:43.985 --> 07:46.683
Everyone and their grandma
knows about The Reckoning.

07:46.727 --> 07:50.295
We wanna know what's going on
with us being in space!

07:50.339 --> 07:52.820
Well, earlier, through
no fault of my own,

07:52.863 --> 07:55.300
I crashed Klaus's truck
into a Tesla.

07:55.344 --> 07:58.303
That's when I remembered
Tesla put a car in space.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.610
And now that's where we are.
Space!

08:00.654 --> 08:02.307
But why?!

08:02.351 --> 08:04.788
Because driving in space
is way harder

08:04.832 --> 08:06.224
than driving on land.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.531
Up here,
even the slightest mistake

08:08.575 --> 08:09.619
will get us all killed.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.316
So if I can do this,

08:11.360 --> 08:13.014
you'll have no choice
but to trust me

08:13.057 --> 08:14.842
behind the wheel of a car.

08:14.885 --> 08:17.714
That's your plan to get us
to trust you?!

08:17.758 --> 08:19.324
Yup.
It was this

08:19.368 --> 08:21.065
or completely
changing my personality

08:21.109 --> 08:23.633
and earning it over
the next 5 to 10 years.

08:23.677 --> 08:26.636
So you can see how space
makes a lot more sense for me.

08:31.859 --> 08:34.644
<i>I've got news!
The local SoSo's Pizza</i>

08:34.688 --> 08:36.385
<i>was obliterated
in what people</i>

08:36.428 --> 08:37.821
<i>who might not even
have been there</i>

08:37.865 --> 08:40.171
<i>are calling
a freak gas explosion.</i>

08:40.215 --> 08:41.651
No!

08:41.695 --> 08:45.046
My babe and babe-in-laws
were at that SoSo's!

08:47.091 --> 08:50.007
You lost your wife,
I lost my truck.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.879
Could today
get any worse?

08:51.922 --> 08:54.577
Hey, fish!
I heard about your dead family

08:54.621 --> 08:57.362
and totaled car.
I'm sorry you're feeling down,

08:57.406 --> 08:58.886
but your premiums
are going up!

09:05.283 --> 09:07.677
Okay,
gonna keep it real simple.

09:07.721 --> 09:10.550
Just a few quick maneuvers,
then it's right back to Earth.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.561
Ta-dah!

09:21.604 --> 09:23.345
Watch out! Tesla!

09:26.783 --> 09:28.872
Did you just get
into a car accident...

09:28.916 --> 09:30.570
in space?

09:30.613 --> 09:32.876
And is it just me,

09:32.920 --> 09:34.269
or are we drifting
further and further

09:34.312 --> 09:36.010
from our sweet Mother Gaia?

09:38.142 --> 09:40.275
Not to worry,
this is a perfect excuse

09:40.318 --> 09:42.277
to show off
my most impressive

09:42.320 --> 09:44.584
and unnecessary
space maneuver.

09:44.627 --> 09:47.499
It's called
a Planetary Slingshot,

09:47.543 --> 09:50.067
- and it's when--
- You use the gravitational pull

09:50.111 --> 09:52.896
of a planet to accelerate,
or "slingshot",

09:52.940 --> 09:55.333
your spacecraft
towards your destination.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.118
The math checks out.

09:57.161 --> 10:00.425
FYI, you absolutely
cannot look at the sun.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.427
Looking directly into the sun
at this proximity

10:02.471 --> 10:04.168
causes Sun Madness.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.735
- Francine?
- That's right.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.607
And once you go Sun Mad,

10:07.650 --> 10:11.523
you'll become so infatuated
by that big ball of gas

10:11.567 --> 10:14.526
that you'll do anything
to burn up inside her.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.485
Including foreplay.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.274
Take us home, Venus!

10:25.494 --> 10:27.627
Screwed the pooch
on that one.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.629
But if at first
you don't succeed!

10:29.672 --> 10:31.413
Come onnnnn, Mercury!

10:35.591 --> 10:37.506
Welp, third time's
the charm.

10:37.549 --> 10:40.117
But there's only two planets
between Earth and the sun!

10:40.161 --> 10:41.641
Nuh-uh!
What about that one?

10:41.684 --> 10:43.643
That's no planet.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.384
It's a pepperoni!

10:46.428 --> 10:49.692
Bad.
So bad.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.782
No big deal. I can turn around
and fly home without a problem.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.479
- With one problem.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.046
We're running low
on fuel.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.961
But we can still get back, right?

10:58.005 --> 10:59.789
Oh, please let me
do the math.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.183
It's like I'm living
in my own word problem.

11:02.226 --> 11:05.012
Let's see...
ship of this size...

11:05.055 --> 11:06.840
account for
the distance...

11:06.883 --> 11:08.668
Good news, family!

11:08.711 --> 11:10.365
If we continue
at this speed,

11:10.408 --> 11:12.889
we should have enough fuel
to get home in...

11:12.933 --> 11:14.848
seven years?!

11:14.891 --> 11:16.327
What the hell, Roger?

11:16.371 --> 11:17.981
Your driving
has ruined our lives!

11:18.025 --> 11:19.591
All you've proven
is that we were right

11:19.635 --> 11:21.158
not to trust you
behind the wheel.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.508
Maybe we shouldn't
trust you at all.

11:23.552 --> 11:26.163
Fine! I'm gonna go journal,
and you better believe

11:26.207 --> 11:28.513
this next entry
will be scathing!

11:30.951 --> 11:32.822
Oh, God.

11:32.866 --> 11:36.086
I would do anything
to not feel this sad.

11:36.130 --> 11:40.395
Well, research shows,
and I don't want to do this,

11:40.438 --> 11:42.353
but when two
grief-stricken adults

11:42.397 --> 11:44.573
lose everything
but each other,

11:44.616 --> 11:47.707
they heal their pain
through boinking.

11:47.750 --> 11:52.189
That's just science, ergo
my scientific term "boinking"

11:52.233 --> 11:56.716
instead of,
you know, sex.

11:56.759 --> 12:00.023
Uh... No offense,
Mr. Klaus,

12:00.067 --> 12:03.070
but I really don't wanna
get on the train

12:03.113 --> 12:04.593
to Boinksville
with you.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.203
Me neither.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.423
Let's hold out
as long as we can.

12:10.294 --> 12:15.604
I spy with my little eye
something that is--

12:15.647 --> 12:17.475
I know!
Is it a star?!

12:17.519 --> 12:19.434
This is gonna be
a long seven years.

12:19.477 --> 12:23.394
It's like a star,
but it's more like a pizzeria

12:23.438 --> 12:24.787
and it's headed
straight toward us.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.276
It's docking.

12:35.319 --> 12:39.149
Someone, or some thing,
is trying to come aboard.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.682
Hey, gang!
It's me, Roger!

12:50.726 --> 12:52.684
No, I'm Roger.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.338
We're both Roger!

12:54.382 --> 12:56.514
Only difference is...
I'm from the future.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.910
And my space tan makes me
a teensy bit sexier.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.787
So you're me,
but from the future?

13:07.830 --> 13:10.267
Aww. Hard to believe
I was ever that naive.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.617
But yes, you little cherub,
I am.

13:12.661 --> 13:13.836
How far
into the future?

13:13.880 --> 13:17.100
Three. Whole. Days.

13:17.144 --> 13:20.277
That's not far,
but still unusual.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.844
How did you travel
back to us?

13:21.888 --> 13:23.454
I popped through
a little wormhole.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.673
That's impossible.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.022
If you suck at driving it is.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.024
Ha!
He got you, Roger!

13:28.068 --> 13:30.635
Hey, um...
Where's the future us?

13:30.679 --> 13:33.290
They died
a couple days ago.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.988
I'm still a little sad
about it.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.859
Aw, that's terrible.
Please let us know--

13:36.903 --> 13:38.730
Wait a minute!
Do you mean us?

13:38.774 --> 13:40.820
That's what I came back
to warn you about.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.473
If you stick
with your plan

13:42.517 --> 13:44.824
to get back to Earth
the slow way, you die.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.042
- Eep!

13:46.086 --> 13:48.305
Your only chance
of getting home

13:48.349 --> 13:50.394
is to slingshot the sun.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.832
Slingshotting?
Sounds promising.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.703
You're just gonna
trust this guy?

13:54.746 --> 13:57.314
Look, young blood, you're
the one who got us in this mess.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.576
I'm trying
to get us out of it.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.404
That settles it.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.711
Future Roger's gonna
slingshot us around the sun.

14:02.754 --> 14:05.714
Great!
I like Future Roger.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.324
He's got
a weathered look

14:07.368 --> 14:10.675
that gives me
"wise cowboy" vibes.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.721
Mighty kind of you,
little lady.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.984
It feels great
to have everyone's trust.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.725
You'll just have to
trust me on that.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.335
Want your diary, buddy?

14:18.379 --> 14:20.424
It's not a diary,
it's a journal!

14:20.468 --> 14:21.991
Like an explorer has!

14:22.035 --> 14:24.080
I'm exploring
my inner thoughts!

14:24.124 --> 14:25.908
Ah!

14:30.217 --> 14:34.351
Wait a second, this entry
is dated three days from now.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.701
This is Future Me's journal!

14:36.745 --> 14:39.617
<i>Dear Journal,
some good news for a change.</i>

14:39.661 --> 14:42.620
<i>I've fallen in love, and you'll
never guess who with!</i>

14:42.664 --> 14:47.234
<i>Her name is The Sun,
and I long to die inside her.</i>

14:47.277 --> 14:50.890
<i>Alas, my family
doesn't understand my love.</i>

14:50.933 --> 14:52.804
<i>By the time we settled
our differences,</i>

14:52.848 --> 14:54.589
<i>we'd been flying in circles
so long</i>

14:54.632 --> 14:57.940
<i>that the ship was
almost completely out of fuel.</i>

14:57.984 --> 15:00.029
<i>But if my calculations
are correct,</i>

15:00.073 --> 15:02.902
<i>I should have just enough fuel
to get to a nearby wormhole</i>

15:02.945 --> 15:04.904
<i>and travel back in time.</i>

15:04.947 --> 15:07.297
<i>Then, I'll be able to take
the Past Smiths' ship</i>

15:07.341 --> 15:08.864
<i>and fly us all
right into the sun!</i>

15:10.953 --> 15:12.563
Holy crap!

15:12.607 --> 15:15.305
Future Me's gone
totally Sun Mad!

15:15.349 --> 15:17.917
And now the only one
who can stop me is Now Me!

15:20.615 --> 15:22.312
Soon, my sweet.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.575
Soon.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.838
Hey, there, whippersnapper.
Whatcha been up to?

15:26.882 --> 15:28.405
Oh, nothing.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.625
Just catching up
on some light reading.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.670
My journal!

15:32.714 --> 15:35.064
I suppose that means you know
the sun and I are lovers.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.674
That ol' flooze?

15:36.718 --> 15:38.676
Buddy of mine raw dogged her
in Cancún.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.940
Said he caught a wicked
case of melanoma.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.593
Oh, sure.
Slut shame the sun.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.160
Real mature.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.770
And so what?
We all have a past.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.511
Oh, a past?

15:47.555 --> 15:49.078
Is that why she still
wakes up every morning

15:49.122 --> 15:51.124
and gives it
to an entire hemisphere?

15:51.167 --> 15:52.995
Take that back!

15:54.127 --> 15:55.171
Aah!

16:00.655 --> 16:03.005
Oh, shitballs.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.269
Rogers!
What's going on here?

16:06.313 --> 16:08.793
Oh, Stan,
it was awful!

16:08.837 --> 16:10.491
I was preparing
for our slingshot

16:10.534 --> 16:13.885
when he detached my ship
and threw my journal into space!

16:13.929 --> 16:15.496
Roger, how could you?

16:15.539 --> 16:17.846
You know how important
that journal is to yourself.

16:17.889 --> 16:20.022
It was him!
He's trying to kill us!

16:20.066 --> 16:22.459
He has Sun Madness!
You gotta believe me!

16:22.503 --> 16:23.634
No, I don't.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.549
If I couldn't trust you before,

16:25.593 --> 16:27.812
there's certainly no reason
for me to trust you now.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.163
Come on, Future Roger.
Let's get you out of here.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.642
It's all a ruse!

16:31.686 --> 16:33.470
He's selfish
and manipulative

16:33.514 --> 16:35.211
and he cares more
about getting what he wants

16:35.255 --> 16:39.041
than he does about this family's
safety and-- ohhhhhh.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.739
This is what it's like
for the family all the time.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.306
I get it now.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.353
Wow, when will I
stop growing?

16:53.273 --> 16:56.406
Roger.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.887
I took the liberty
of upgrading your seatbelts.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.327
- Good looking out.
- We can always count on you.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.025
Now that you're restrained,

17:06.068 --> 17:08.027
I should probably mention
that I have Sun Madness.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.160
Completely addicted
to the sun.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.597
But don't worry, I'm working
through a twelve-step program,

17:13.641 --> 17:15.860
and the first step is admitting
I have a problem.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.079
The second step?

17:17.123 --> 17:19.603
Flying directly into the sun!

17:23.738 --> 17:25.174
Why isn't it working?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.394
I knew you'd try
something like this,

17:27.437 --> 17:30.223
which is why I sabotaged
your accelerator.

17:30.266 --> 17:33.182
It's also why I rewired
the emergency eject button

17:33.226 --> 17:35.054
to be over here.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.925
Goodbye, Roger.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.059
I'm three days older
than you.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.756
You think I didn't
see this coming?

17:41.799 --> 17:43.714
I knew you'd try
to sabotage me,

17:43.758 --> 17:46.674
which is why I put
the real eject button over here!

17:48.415 --> 17:50.460
You must be getting slow
in your old age,

17:50.504 --> 17:53.246
because I knew you'd know
that I'd deceive you,

17:53.289 --> 17:55.683
which is why I put
the real eject button over here!

17:57.424 --> 18:00.296
You didn't think I'd know
you knew I knew you'd know?

18:00.340 --> 18:02.298
The real eject button
is over here!

18:05.345 --> 18:07.216
Would you kill
each other already?!

18:07.260 --> 18:08.739
You're a worthy opponent,

18:08.783 --> 18:10.741
but there's one thing
you didn't count on.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.003
The truth!

18:12.047 --> 18:13.744
That's right, this whole time

18:13.788 --> 18:16.225
the real emergency
eject button has been...

18:16.269 --> 18:18.097
the emergency
eject button!

18:19.837 --> 18:22.666
Well played,
but it's not over yet.

18:22.710 --> 18:25.713
Good luck trying to push
a button without any hands!

18:29.195 --> 18:32.589
You jagoffs got confused
by the temporal paradox.

18:32.633 --> 18:36.419
You're future him, so when
you cut off your hands--

18:36.463 --> 18:38.769
I'm only cutting off
my own hands!

18:38.813 --> 18:41.990
Which gives me
the upper hand.

18:43.644 --> 18:46.821
Aaaaah!

18:48.649 --> 18:50.520
Joke's on you.

18:50.564 --> 18:53.958
I'm headed right into
the fiery arms of my beloved!

18:54.002 --> 18:56.265
Aah!

18:56.309 --> 18:57.440
Noooooo!

18:57.484 --> 19:00.008
I'm stuck in perfect orbit!

19:00.051 --> 19:02.141
But if I can't be inside you,

19:02.184 --> 19:05.274
at least I can pleasure myself
to your presence.

19:05.318 --> 19:08.016
Oh, God!
No hands!

19:08.059 --> 19:12.063
Roger, you saved us
from yourself.

19:12.107 --> 19:14.805
Maybe, but if I want you
to trust me,

19:14.849 --> 19:16.285
I have to be honest
with you.

19:16.329 --> 19:19.332
And the big truth is,
I can't drive.

19:25.207 --> 19:28.341
We've entered the sun's
gravitational field!

19:28.384 --> 19:30.865
Our only way out is to
pull off a slingshot!

19:30.908 --> 19:32.736
What do you say, Roger?

19:32.780 --> 19:34.999
Can we trust you with our lives
twice in one hour?

19:35.043 --> 19:36.044
I don't know...

19:36.087 --> 19:37.741
You can do this,
Roger!

19:37.785 --> 19:39.743
We believe
in you!

19:39.787 --> 19:41.658
Personally I think this family's
a little too quick to forgive.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.312
You're right.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.923
With your trust behind me,
I can do anything.

19:56.107 --> 19:59.067
It's so hot!
We're too close!

19:59.110 --> 20:00.329
Wait for it...

20:00.373 --> 20:02.331
She's falling apart!

20:02.375 --> 20:03.941
Almost there...

20:09.251 --> 20:10.383
Now!

20:15.388 --> 20:16.954
Whee!

20:16.998 --> 20:18.347
Great job, Roger!

20:18.391 --> 20:19.566
You did it!

20:19.609 --> 20:21.524
What a slingshot!

20:21.568 --> 20:23.874
Does this mean I'm driving
to Oktoberfest next year?

20:23.918 --> 20:25.224
Only if you don't drink.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.094
Ech.
Never mind.

20:28.270 --> 20:31.926
I'm still sad
my whole family's dead.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.102
I'm still sad
about my truck.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.277
I give in!

20:35.321 --> 20:37.584
Me too!

20:37.627 --> 20:39.281
- Let's heal!
- Let's heal!

20:39.325 --> 20:42.458
<i>♪ Oh, he's grieving♪</i>

20:42.502 --> 20:44.721

Bye!
