WEBVTT

00:44.044 --> 00:45.253
Jesus Christ.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.716
Kid! It's Frank.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.386
Frank. Frank.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.182
-Frank, she wants to arrest you.
-Just give me the gun, kid.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.267
She's gonna sell you out.

00:59.976 --> 01:00.977
Hey...

01:01.603 --> 01:02.729
give me the gun.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.273
It's okay.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.776
It's okay, kid.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.165
Where the hell were you?

01:24.709 --> 01:26.211
Went to get some advice.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.130
Yeah

01:36.179 --> 01:37.180
My wife.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.975
Well, did she tell you
how out of line you were?

01:53.905 --> 01:55.740
Are you really here to take me in?

01:56.991 --> 01:59.619
Or you just didn't have
any other place to go?

02:00.453 --> 02:03.039
Yeah, her and everybody else, Frank.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.375
And whose fault is that?

02:06.167 --> 02:09.587
Nobody really likes making their
Friday night the Punisher pity party,

02:09.671 --> 02:10.797
you know what I mean?

02:25.061 --> 02:26.354
If you had asked me once,

02:26.437 --> 02:29.399
I would've told you
I was pretty much just like anyone else.

02:32.235 --> 02:36.698
And all I really gave a shit about
was that my family was healthy or happy.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.702
But I lost them.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.580
Everything changed.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.793
I thought... I thought
I became something different.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.424
But last night...

02:55.800 --> 02:57.594
I had a little chat with my wife.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.974
I sat by her grave,
and I realized something.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.270
This is always who I was.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.358
And Maria...

03:14.360 --> 03:15.445
she knew.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.157
She knew what I was.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.327
She loved me anyway.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.000
Yeah.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.754
I'm just...

03:34.255 --> 03:35.798
I'm not like you people.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.551
You know, I can do things you can't do.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.014
Whatever that makes me...

03:45.892 --> 03:46.893
it makes me.

03:56.694 --> 03:57.695
This.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.073
It has to end, Frank.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.408
Who's gonna end it, though?

04:03.701 --> 04:04.702
You?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.413
Mahoney?

04:09.582 --> 04:10.959
You gonna take Bill to jail?

04:11.042 --> 04:13.503
This billionaire asshole
who's coming after her?

04:16.714 --> 04:20.468
These people, they... they won't stop.
They can't stop.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.303
They don't give a shit about your law.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.558
So what the hell am I doing
carrying this badge?

04:27.642 --> 04:28.643
Yeah.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.148
I can't answer that for you.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.194
I don't have answers for any of you.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.239
Then what are you asking?

04:43.616 --> 04:45.702
Let me be what I'm meant to be.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.374
Serpent Five,
this is Serpent Six. Go for launch.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.880
Serpent Six, this is Serpent Five,
we are waiting at the door.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.383
Copy, Serpent Five,
you're a go for action.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.356
Copy, Serpent Five,
you're a go for entry.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.323
You know this can't last forever.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.700
You're too smart not to.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.247
Okay.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.834
But that doesn't mean we can't make plans.

06:59.293 --> 07:00.336
For after.

07:03.047 --> 07:06.551
At some point, enough's got to be enough.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.720
It all has to be for something.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.017
It will.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.812
Police say
four people are dead and three wounded

07:17.895 --> 07:21.899
in a gang-related gun battle that broke
out in a Lower East Side housing project.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.902
Some are calling it
the major salvo in a gang war,

07:24.986 --> 07:28.281
one of three such raids
in the last 24 hours.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.117
With the money, we can go anywhere...

07:33.911 --> 07:37.165
be anything we want to be. Together.

07:40.835 --> 07:41.919
And we will.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.964
I promise.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.264
But you have to let me
deal with Frank first.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.850
It has been
a violent and bloody 24 hours

07:55.933 --> 07:58.269
here in the New York area
as three separate...

07:58.352 --> 08:00.396
Gang activity
is on the rise in New York,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.648
-as multiple fatalities...
-A bizarre scene,

08:02.732 --> 08:05.776
witnesses report seeing a gang
in frightening masks.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.278
Fellas.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.242
Two months.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.621
According to police, the men
gunned down everyone inside the building

08:16.704 --> 08:19.081
and made off with nearly
a half million dollars in contraband.

08:19.165 --> 08:23.252
...making off with more than
half a million in cash, drugs and weapons.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.719
Don't let Frank define who you are.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.348
Look at me.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.354
Really look.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.818
I have to know why he wants me dead.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.490
I have to know.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.220
-No, I'm good.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.848
Hey, come on. Sit down.
It's not a big deal.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.893
-Dude! Get... get off of me!
-I'm testing the merchandise.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.229
I'm not merchandise, asshole!
Get your hands off of me.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.481
-Listen, bitch--
-Moke!

09:28.651 --> 09:30.361
Play nice with our guests.

09:43.207 --> 09:46.043
This new driver is supposed to get me
an extra ten yards.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.754
So far, it's not the game changer
I thought it would be.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.134
Perhaps I'm misplacing my faith. Hmm?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.806
The scrutiny Castle is under worries me.

09:58.889 --> 10:03.519
If the police apprehend him or the girl,
they may try to leverage what they have.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.564
And what is that?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.150
Do you have faith in me, John?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.111
I do.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.658
Well, these are testing times.

10:19.493 --> 10:22.121
I think we need to take radical steps.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.709
I want you to use your old contacts here,
in the city.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.338
Set a bounty on Castle and the girl.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.299
Turn this city against them.

10:34.258 --> 10:36.344
It's better that I do it myself.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.680
It's good that you have
such faith in yourself, as do I,

10:39.764 --> 10:42.767
but we cannot afford pride at this moment.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.898
Castle shot up a city street
in broad daylight.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.401
We're way past the time
for keeping things quiet.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.529
It's risky, me opening old doors.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.616
You're not the man you were.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.703
John, I just want to get ya home.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.500
Rebecca's fortitude is a wonder.
Her spirit is so strong.

11:07.583 --> 11:12.922
And they put on a... a great face
when you're not there, your boys.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.135
No one knows
how much our families need us.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.387
Any of us.

11:20.012 --> 11:23.808
All the things we do for them
that they can never know.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.520
You'll be home soon, God willing.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.106
Yes, God willing.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.776
Now let's finish it.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.154
Let's get ya home.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.660
...Six, this is Kingdom Five.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.620
We're northbound
on the Phase Line Jupiter.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.288
Two clicks out from OBJ Zebra.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.416
They're staying within a certain area.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.378
Yeah, it's probably a radius
from wherever they're based.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.131
Kingdom Five,
this is Kingdom Six,

11:55.214 --> 11:57.091
we are Molotov at this time.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.217
What's Molotov?

11:58.300 --> 12:01.512
We use certain words
to indicate operational steps.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.764
Molotov means they're in position
with their target.

12:07.351 --> 12:08.436
Yeah, Curt.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.110
Okay. Yeah, I'm on the move.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.249
Let's go! Let's go!

12:37.882 --> 12:38.883
Shit.

13:22.009 --> 13:26.597
Well, now I know
why we don't see you home so much.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.016
We do have golf courses there,
too, you know?

13:30.935 --> 13:34.021
Your mother often wonders
if you came to New York for the job,

13:34.104 --> 13:37.066
-or you took the job for New York.
-Both.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.320
God damn it!

13:43.364 --> 13:44.448
Now, now, Dad.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.494
What would the faithful think
if they were to hear you blaspheming?

13:49.078 --> 13:51.956
Well, son, you see,
there's two kinds of blasphemy.

13:52.039 --> 13:56.043
There's the ones that people
are happy to forgive, and...

13:57.253 --> 13:58.838
then there's the stuff that they aren't.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.257
Here we go.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.968
I think people might surprise you.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.719
Times have changed.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.972
Yeah, not that much, and you know it.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.223
I don't like surprises.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.725
Surprises mean you haven't prepared.
I like to be prepared.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.519
What you like is to be in control.

14:13.602 --> 14:14.520
Yes.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.233
Very nice.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.195
I'm just wondering why the visit?

14:23.279 --> 14:26.907
Unless it's to nag me
about finding a wife for party optics.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.078
When was the last time
we had a conversation about my life

14:31.161 --> 14:33.539
that didn't sound like campaign strategy?

14:33.622 --> 14:37.334
When was the last time
you just asked me if I was happy?

14:37.418 --> 14:40.087
Happy

14:42.047 --> 14:45.467
Son, we are in a position
to change this country for the better.

14:46.176 --> 14:49.555
People take a look at you, and they see
an example they want to follow.

14:49.638 --> 14:54.018
People want to believe, David,
in something.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.688
Because it's a terrifying world
to be alone.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.399
So they need faith.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.819
They take a look at me,
they see all that I've achieved,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.362
and it makes sense.

15:06.405 --> 15:11.493
How could I have all of this
if God hadn't chosen it for me?

15:13.829 --> 15:16.081
It's a question I ask myself every day.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.586
We are living proof
that faith is rewarded.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.262
See?

15:31.722 --> 15:34.975
David, I want you to come home
for a little while.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.104
Talk to some people. Donors. Press flesh.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.107
Just a couple of weeks, that's all.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.277
Just to get some things out of the way.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.572
What is so important right now?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.374
Yeah?

16:07.883 --> 16:08.926
Nice suit.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.554
I heard about you.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.391
The man with the five million, am I right?

16:16.850 --> 16:19.061
I'm kind of insulted
you didn't come here first.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.022
-Does that mean you don't want to talk?
-No.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.441
No. Just sayin', word travels fast.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.735
Would have liked my guys
to have a head start.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.415
I thought this guy was dead already.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.458
Now I know why you're offering so much.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.253
I want Castle and the girl alive.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.506
Tell me where they are
or bring them to me.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.134
How alive?

16:52.136 --> 16:53.762
One of them needs to talk.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.436
Put out the word.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.355
Call me on this if you have anything.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.443
Hey. Where are you from?

17:08.777 --> 17:11.822
You don't seem like you're from
around here, don't mind me saying.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.712
Hey, it's Danny. Put him on.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.923
He's gonna want to hear
what I have to say, trust me.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.800
What is it?

17:32.551 --> 17:34.511
Guess who just walked into my place.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.223
A goddamn ghost.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.731
Thanks.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.067
Yeah. Living the dream.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.785
Would you still be in the military
if you didn't lose your leg?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.080
No, I'd be getting too old.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.958
You see, that's the thing,
is when you sign up,

18:05.042 --> 18:07.753
it never enters your mind
that it isn't forever.

18:07.836 --> 18:12.466
Just some young kid full of ideas
of travel, adventure and war.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.096
Unless you're an officer,
there's always a second life.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.264
Now what about you?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.017
Is this how you saw yourself?

18:22.101 --> 18:25.729
Yeah. I love mobile living.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.481
My fold-out life.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.154
It seems like your chosen line of work
is pretty damn sketchy,

18:34.238 --> 18:35.906
even before Frank turned up.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.993
I mean, shouldn't you be somewhere

18:40.077 --> 18:42.663
Freaking your old man out about boys?

18:42.746 --> 18:44.123
Learning how to drive?

18:47.668 --> 18:48.710
Marine salvage.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.130
Say what?

18:51.213 --> 18:52.297
Marine salvage.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.134
That's what I've always wanted to do.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.302
I saw a documentary on it once.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.807
Find treasure under the sea.
And if you find it, you get to keep it.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.935
You know what, Amy?
Just forget I even asked.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.062
No. No, seriously.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.566
I remember they were in the Caribbean,

19:10.649 --> 19:15.904
and the sea was so green
and there was all this sun.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.408
And there was no noise under the water.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.953
Just all this old stuff
waiting to be found. Like...

19:23.620 --> 19:26.248
Spanish gold and jewels and stuff.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.833
Hmm.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.838
I guess if we get out from under,
there's no stopping you from going, huh?

19:33.881 --> 19:36.925
Shit like this definitely makes you
reassess your goals.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.138
I can't even swim.

19:41.221 --> 19:45.893
Actually, I've never seen the ocean.
So... there's that.

19:50.397 --> 19:53.275
He could at least call
and let us know what the hell is going on.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.194
Frank?

19:55.944 --> 19:57.279
Yeah, right.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.532
Come on, Curtis. He's selfish.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.827
He says all of this is for us,
but it's not.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.704
He's got an itch,
and he's gonna scratch it.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.123
We're just, like, the staff.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.627
You know what? You're right.

20:11.710 --> 20:15.130
Yeah. I usually am. It's kind of a gift.

20:16.673 --> 20:19.593
Look, I got someplace I need to be.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.763
I'm letting some people down.
And they get let down a lot.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.641
Frank is out doing his own thing,
and I'mma do mine.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.268
So, what

20:28.352 --> 20:31.772
I don't get to have a thing

20:31.855 --> 20:33.232
Like a dog nobody wants?

20:33.315 --> 20:36.818
-You're gonna be safe here.
-No, I'm not. I'm just alone.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.947
I could be doing this literally anywhere.

20:40.030 --> 20:43.742
Anywhere with, like, clean sheets
and a properly-flushing bathroom.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.120
-Come on, take me with you, Curtis.
-I can't.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.497
Yeah, you can.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.335
Well... then, I won't.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.115
What will it be?

22:49.076 --> 22:50.702
You can help me out.

22:50.786 --> 22:54.206
There's a group of vets
running around town causing trouble.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.957
I hear maybe you've been
partying with them.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.834
-No idea what you're talking about.
-No, huh?

22:59.044 --> 23:01.004
Okay. Well...

23:02.589 --> 23:03.882
maybe this will help you.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.350
Who's that?

23:14.434 --> 23:16.061
I don't want any trouble.

23:17.437 --> 23:18.563
Where are they?

23:22.067 --> 23:24.694
If I talk, do you promise
none of this comes back on me?

23:25.529 --> 23:26.947
You're not my problem.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.866
Shit, what do I care?

23:29.950 --> 23:32.077
Those guys were total assholes.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.620
Especially him.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.872
Cut anything else off him,
that'd make my day.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.419
They call it Valhalla.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.088
I don't know,
some Viking bullshit or something.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.756
They're off the rails.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.842
Stealing shit, partying all night.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.845
Tony knows some of them.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.973
Sounded like it could be fun,
so I went along.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.392
Turned out it wasn't so much.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.270
Frat house bullshit turned up to 11.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.523
You know where?

24:01.606 --> 24:03.150
Somewhere in Queens.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.693
It was dark. I don't know.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.028
A warehouse. Maybe north of 14th.
Something like that.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.447
Okay.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.493
I appreciate it.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.498
Hey, Tony.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.668
Call it a tip.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.192
You assholes lost?

24:50.405 --> 24:52.949
Yeah, we were looking for $5 million.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.869
And it was stupid enough
to show up on its own.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.288
What are you talking about?

24:58.371 --> 25:00.499
Someone's had enough
of your shit, Castle.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.042
Put a bounty on your head.

25:03.084 --> 25:04.753
Where's the girl

25:04.836 --> 25:08.507
Someone wants you and some kid.
You're gonna take us to her.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.716
Who are they?

25:10.842 --> 25:15.597
Listen, asshole,
there's one of you, and six--

25:28.610 --> 25:29.611
Let's talk.

26:20.662 --> 26:21.746
Tough day?

26:41.683 --> 26:43.893
They did a hell of a job fixing your face.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.063
Considering.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.317
You sound disappointed.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.943
-I am.
-Were you there?

26:52.027 --> 26:55.113
What does your file say?
Your lawyer must have read it to you.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.579
It says that you arrested me.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.459
But that I shot you.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.838
I don't remember any of that.

27:13.548 --> 27:16.343
It also says that we were together,
me and you.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.095
I'd hardly call it that.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.766
Then why do you hate me so much?

27:24.476 --> 27:26.686
You really don't know, do you?

27:27.604 --> 27:28.980
All those nights...

27:30.774 --> 27:32.150
all those mornings...

27:32.984 --> 27:33.985
wasted.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.945
A year of your life.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.366
That's...

27:39.949 --> 27:41.368
some kind of commitment.

27:42.702 --> 27:43.703
I...

27:44.371 --> 27:45.372
I envy you.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.832
I envy you remembering. I...

27:49.959 --> 27:51.461
envy you knowing how you feel.

27:51.544 --> 27:54.714
I should--
I should know how I felt about you.

28:01.888 --> 28:04.015
I mean, did we...

28:07.644 --> 28:08.978
Here, in this place?

28:09.062 --> 28:10.188
Why are you here?

28:13.108 --> 28:14.109
Answers.

28:19.322 --> 28:21.324
Okay, can I make another drink at least?

28:23.368 --> 28:24.703
Knock yourself out.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.080
You want one?

28:29.374 --> 28:32.919
Hey, if that backup gun were still
in there, would you try to shoot me?

28:33.002 --> 28:34.337
In a heartbeat.

28:35.171 --> 28:38.550
Guess you're in charge, Billy. In control.
Just how you've always liked it.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.302
You know, you might not remember,
but you haven't changed.

28:42.011 --> 28:45.181
Same psychotic asshole you always were.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.059
Yeah, I can see why I liked you.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.894
-You used me.
-Maybe.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.981
Doesn't mean I didn't like you, too.

29:00.905 --> 29:03.158
Frank did this to me...

29:07.495 --> 29:08.496
didn't he?

29:10.373 --> 29:11.374
Sorry, who?

29:11.958 --> 29:15.545
No, no, no, no. You don't do that.
You don't do that!

29:15.628 --> 29:17.213
'Cause I know! I know now!

29:19.132 --> 29:20.675
Nobody...

29:20.759 --> 29:23.511
Nobody seems to have the answers.
But you do. I know you do.

29:24.888 --> 29:28.099
So I need to know how.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.491
You sold out
everything you ever stood for,

29:44.574 --> 29:48.453
anyone you ever cared about,
and you did it for money and status.

29:48.536 --> 29:51.831
Left Frank for dead, covered in the blood
of his wife and children.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.875
-That's who you are.
-No. No--

29:53.958 --> 29:57.003
Yeah. And when he found out,
he came after you and he made you pay.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.925
Now, look me in the eye
and tell me something.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.051
Am I lying?

30:08.181 --> 30:12.101
Frank wanted you to live with it
on your face every day.

30:12.185 --> 30:15.605
He put all that ugly on the outside
where it belongs.

30:17.482 --> 30:21.110
And maybe you should just
do us all a favor and shoot yourself.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.071
Get it over with.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.075
Because Frank will come after you, and...

30:28.409 --> 30:30.495
he will finish the job.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.005
I'm a hard man to kill, Agent Madani.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.305
Did we have some good times, Dinah?

30:51.182 --> 30:52.475
I'll bet we did.

30:55.895 --> 30:56.896
Yeah.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.567
Look at how much
you want to kill me right now.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.403
We definitely did.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.657
I dreamed about Frank every night.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.828
Who did you dream about?

31:15.707 --> 31:16.791
But, hey...

31:18.293 --> 31:20.545
at least you will
always have the memories.

31:21.588 --> 31:22.630
Am I right?

31:25.717 --> 31:26.718
Right.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.055
I'll leave your weapons downstairs.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.976
If you try to follow me,

31:35.059 --> 31:37.228
my men outside in the hallway
will kill you.

32:21.856 --> 32:24.108
-Who is it?
-Uh, it's me.

32:25.151 --> 32:26.152
It's Amy.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.788
-Shan! Hey.
-Amy.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.332
-Hey.
-Hi.

32:40.667 --> 32:41.501
Um...

32:42.460 --> 32:45.713
Yeah, this is my friend's place, actually.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.592
I'm just staying here
while my apartment gets renovated, so...

32:50.134 --> 32:55.473
Well, I have been living in a trailer
with a backed-up toilet, so...

32:55.556 --> 32:59.560
Hey, at least it's not
that place that Fiona had us living in.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.605
What was that place above
the Indian restaurant with all the mice?

33:02.689 --> 33:04.399
Oh! I totally forgot about that.

33:05.274 --> 33:07.735
Yeah. You're not with Fiona anymore?

33:08.194 --> 33:10.488
I didn't think
you'd be the one to take off.

33:11.990 --> 33:12.991
She's dead.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.035
They all are, actually.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.705
Oh! Shit.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.708
That's heavy. What happened?

33:22.792 --> 33:24.210
You know, honestly...

33:25.169 --> 33:27.422
it's probably better
if I just don't tell you.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.132
Seriously.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.467
Look, I just... I gotta disappear.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.053
You told me you were
connected up here, yeah?

33:34.637 --> 33:36.222
You think you could hook me up?

33:37.223 --> 33:39.434
Sure. Yeah, I got a guy.

33:39.976 --> 33:44.313
But it's not free.
And if you want it fast, it'll be more.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.784
-That all you got?
-Don't hustle me, Shan.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.453
Force of habit.

34:01.664 --> 34:02.665
Who's that?

34:03.791 --> 34:06.794
-Uh... No one important.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.380
Um...

34:10.757 --> 34:13.259
Go make yourself comfortable.
I'll make some calls.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.343
Thanks.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.682
Man, what you did to Jake wasn't cool.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.351
You ever known me to miss a meeting?

35:04.852 --> 35:07.188
Not be there when any of you guys called?

35:07.271 --> 35:09.148
Share a secret that you've shared?

35:09.690 --> 35:10.942
No.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.735
I got you.

35:13.903 --> 35:14.987
And you know why?

35:15.738 --> 35:17.490
Because of what we shared.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.535
Because of what we have in common.

35:21.828 --> 35:25.832
Because we know what it means
to have someone you can put your faith in.

35:27.333 --> 35:30.086
And the problem with faith
is that people abuse it.

35:31.087 --> 35:34.048
Jake was running with Billy Russo.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.759
Yeah, the same asshole that shot me

35:36.843 --> 35:40.096
is running around shooting up shit,
robbing and murdering,

35:40.179 --> 35:42.348
and recruiting guys like us
to help him do it.

35:42.431 --> 35:46.144
I called you because I had faith
that you'd be no part of it.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.230
The fact that I'm still
standing here breathing

35:49.313 --> 35:51.149
means that I got that right.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.483
Yeah, you did.

35:53.025 --> 35:54.652
So you want us to fight your fight?

35:54.735 --> 35:57.655
No, no. I just want you to find him.

35:58.156 --> 36:02.243
Oh, we'll find 'em. Some of those assholes
ain't exactly quiet about their shit.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.666
Kid!

36:22.096 --> 36:23.097
God damn it.

36:28.477 --> 36:29.604
Yeah?

36:29.687 --> 36:32.023
Hey. Where are you?

36:32.106 --> 36:35.526
Yeah, I told you to stay put. You were
gonna listen to the radio. We had a plan.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.738
Yeah, what Billy's doing is affecting
more people than just us.

36:38.821 --> 36:41.824
If he's recruiting vets, my guys should
be able to find out where they are.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.118
Yeah. Hey, Curt, look,
I know where he is, all right?

36:44.202 --> 36:47.121
It's a warehouse in Queens.
The kid's with you, right?

36:48.539 --> 36:50.249
No, she was there when I left.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.334
God...

36:52.585 --> 36:54.295
What did I say to you, Curtis?

36:54.378 --> 36:56.505
What did I say to you?
You were supposed to watch her.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.674
-Don't start. I'm not some--
-No, you listen.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.135
There's a contract out on us. $5 million.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.054
Five million dollars, Curtis.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.431
Every asshole in the city
is looking for her right now.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.557
Shit!

37:06.641 --> 37:07.642
Yeah, shit!

37:08.434 --> 37:09.435
Way to go, Curt.

37:09.977 --> 37:10.937
Damn it!

37:20.321 --> 37:21.697
Take a hint, Frank.

37:21.781 --> 37:25.910
Dial a million times and no one picks up,
it usually means they don't want to talk.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.371
-Hey, where are you?
-With a friend.

37:28.454 --> 37:29.830
A real one.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.124
Kid, you need to come home.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.168
There's a contract out on us.

37:34.794 --> 37:37.463
Every piece of shit in this city
is looking for you right now.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.215
I need you to come back now.

37:39.298 --> 37:42.051
I'm leaving,
like I should've in the beginning.

37:42.802 --> 37:43.970
Okay.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.179
Listen to me.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.224
I will put you on a train myself,
but you need to come back.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.894
Let me ask you a question. How much
do you trust this friend of yours, huh?

37:51.978 --> 37:54.855
Because right now you're the most
valuable thing they've ever seen.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.489
I loved his family.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.660
I loved his family. The...

38:08.911 --> 38:11.872
closest thing I had to one of my own.
So even if I did...

38:13.332 --> 38:15.376
what they say that I did. Even if...

38:17.545 --> 38:18.963
All right...

38:19.672 --> 38:20.673
kill me.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.342
But to leave me like this?

38:24.802 --> 38:26.262
To carve me up.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.724
There is no honor in that.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.685
After everything...
After everything that we went through.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.771
I deserve more.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.695
I deserve more.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.115
How do you know all of this?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.493
I went to Dinah Madani.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.166
And you didn't think to tell me that?

38:56.584 --> 38:58.836
Do you not know how risky that was?

38:59.962 --> 39:01.047
How'd it feel?

39:02.631 --> 39:04.675
-It didn't...
-You were lovers once.

39:08.304 --> 39:09.305
Not in here.

39:12.266 --> 39:13.351
And not here.

39:15.394 --> 39:16.395
Hey...

39:18.064 --> 39:22.026
there is only person that matters in here.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.197
And Frank.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.034
She was there when he did this.

39:30.826 --> 39:32.495
Then maybe she knows where he is.

39:36.540 --> 39:37.917
He won't stop.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.503
He won't stop coming. I wouldn't.

39:41.337 --> 39:42.755
We can go anywhere.

39:44.006 --> 39:46.634
He can't find you
if he doesn't know where you are.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.303
And then I will always know that I ran.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.264
I would've put...

39:52.348 --> 39:54.225
I would've put him out of his misery.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.769
You have something special, Billy.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.856
You have built yourself up
from nothing, twice.

40:01.607 --> 40:04.026
Fought your way out of hell
more times than you can count.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.404
Frank didn't take things from you.

40:06.487 --> 40:09.031
He gave you... us...

40:09.115 --> 40:10.616
a second chance.

40:15.704 --> 40:19.458
I want him to feel what I felt.

40:23.712 --> 40:27.299
I want him to suffer. I want him to hurt.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.191
I got something for ya.

40:45.526 --> 40:46.527
Do you have them?

40:46.610 --> 40:48.529
I got someone
who knows where they are.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.322
Come by my restaurant. I'll hook you up.

40:57.621 --> 40:58.622
Soon.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.857
Hey, asshole!

41:25.608 --> 41:27.026
What the hell are you doing?

41:29.570 --> 41:30.988
What's it look like, man?

42:19.995 --> 42:22.081
Remember I called you when payday comes.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.292
It's this one.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.346
She's not here.

42:44.144 --> 42:45.479
-What--
-There's no one here.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.439
What? No. She was right there!

42:54.238 --> 42:56.115
No way she could've passed us going up.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.576
I'll stay here.
You guys check the other floors.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.441
Must be him.

43:30.524 --> 43:31.942
Go. I'll find the girl.

43:58.886 --> 44:02.222
Come out! Or I'm gonna start
putting bullets through the door.

44:08.604 --> 44:11.732
Hey-- Hey, please. Please?

44:11.815 --> 44:13.317
Please just let me go, okay?

44:34.004 --> 44:36.548
-Kid!
-He's not gonna kill you if you let me go.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.425
Come up here, and she's dead! You hear me?

44:38.509 --> 44:40.844
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You touch her, I'll kill you!

44:40.928 --> 44:42.763
She's dead if you don't back off!

44:42.846 --> 44:45.015
Hey! I'll pull you apart!

44:49.228 --> 44:50.479
You're not gonna--

44:51.814 --> 44:53.107
Kid!

44:57.820 --> 44:59.113
No!

45:05.953 --> 45:06.954
Easy.

45:07.496 --> 45:08.497
Hey, hey, hey.

45:10.165 --> 45:11.667
God!

45:12.918 --> 45:14.086
Oh, God!

45:14.169 --> 45:15.170
Easy, easy.

45:17.464 --> 45:20.676
-I killed him. I killed him.
-Give me the gun.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.095
No.

45:23.178 --> 45:25.889
No, you just shot him, okay

45:25.973 --> 45:27.516
See that? I killed him.

45:27.599 --> 45:29.685
Right

45:29.768 --> 45:32.479
Hey... we need to go, all right

45:32.563 --> 45:34.857
Gotta get your stuff
and get you outta here, okay?

45:34.940 --> 45:39.069
No, no, no, no, no. Hey, look at me. Hey.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.280
Listen to me, okay?

45:41.363 --> 45:44.199
His blood ain't worth
a single one of your tears.

45:46.326 --> 45:47.453
Look at me.

45:48.245 --> 45:50.289
Take five seconds, yeah?

45:57.004 --> 45:58.714
Yeah

45:59.423 --> 46:00.799
Attagirl.

46:00.883 --> 46:01.884
Let's go.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.789
Oh! They... Amy, look. No, see...

46:31.872 --> 46:32.915
Seriously, look.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.793
See? They made me do it.

46:35.876 --> 46:38.003
Amy... come on.

46:38.086 --> 46:39.379
They made me do it, okay?

46:55.646 --> 46:58.106
Thank you for coming.
Please, come in.

47:05.405 --> 47:07.658
Can I get you something

47:08.325 --> 47:09.701
Yeah, I'd take a scotch.

47:10.994 --> 47:13.330
Is that your medication of choice,
Agent Madani?

47:13.413 --> 47:15.624
Whoa. Doctor, you called me, remember?

47:15.707 --> 47:17.584
Sorry, that's a force of habit. Please.

47:31.473 --> 47:33.016
I don't know how you live with it.

47:35.477 --> 47:38.564
Not knowing if somebody
that you arrested or convicted

47:38.647 --> 47:40.315
might come back at you someday...

47:41.066 --> 47:43.110
fixate on you
as the cause of their problems.

47:43.193 --> 47:44.486
It's-- It's so easy...

47:45.779 --> 47:47.823
to build that up in your mind...

47:49.324 --> 47:52.619
until it becomes a reality
that you're afraid to come true.

47:53.245 --> 47:56.164
When Billy Russo escaped,
I didn't have any of those feelings.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.460
And now that's all I can think about.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.257
Is that ridiculous of me?

48:05.340 --> 48:06.341
No.

48:07.676 --> 48:08.677
No.

48:09.219 --> 48:11.263
But he's been gone weeks, so why now?

48:11.847 --> 48:14.224
I treated Billy for a long time.

48:14.308 --> 48:18.103
He had memory loss, blank spots,
both physical and emotional.

48:18.186 --> 48:21.982
You, for instance.
How he came to be injured.

48:22.065 --> 48:25.319
Much of his anger was about not having
answers to those questions.

48:25.402 --> 48:27.070
And I'm afraid that he's gonna...

48:28.739 --> 48:30.407
come back looking for answers.

48:31.366 --> 48:32.993
He's got those answers now.

48:36.330 --> 48:37.998
I don't follow.

48:39.041 --> 48:41.501
Russo was in my apartment, Dr. Dumont.

48:43.003 --> 48:46.214
He came looking for those answers
at the end of a gun.

48:46.298 --> 48:49.092
You saw the news

48:49.176 --> 48:51.386
Yes. Billy spoke of Castle often.

48:51.470 --> 48:53.055
Castle is the reason that...

48:54.139 --> 48:55.474
that Billy can't remember.

48:55.557 --> 48:58.185
Castle sounds even worse than Russo.

48:58.644 --> 48:59.561
No.

49:01.188 --> 49:03.231
No, Castle's a whole other thing.

49:05.567 --> 49:07.986
You know what?
The truth is I'm jealous of them both.

49:09.613 --> 49:13.659
Neither of them give a shit.
Absolute purity of purpose.

49:14.534 --> 49:16.078
You know them both well.

49:16.536 --> 49:19.498
Oh, yeah, I've got a real insight.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.294
Maybe if you did, you'd be drinking, too.

49:26.254 --> 49:27.714
I might have some wine.

49:28.507 --> 49:29.591
If you're staying.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.761
Sure.

49:35.555 --> 49:37.474
I've got nowhere else to go anyway.

49:46.316 --> 49:47.985
Well, you took your time.

49:48.318 --> 49:49.569
You got news for me?

49:52.030 --> 49:53.448
You are the news, brother.

49:56.743 --> 49:58.495
How you doin', Robbie?

50:07.129 --> 50:08.839
Come on, please. Join me.

50:09.631 --> 50:10.716
Have a seat.

50:21.810 --> 50:22.811
Top shelf.

50:23.395 --> 50:26.148
Not like the shit
we used to drink.

50:30.736 --> 50:32.821
I know that I wear a suit now, but...

50:34.114 --> 50:36.283
do me the respect
of having a drink with me.

50:38.201 --> 50:39.661
I ain't changed that much.

50:41.455 --> 50:42.539
I have.

50:43.206 --> 50:46.918
That's for sure. I don't know,
cat got your tongue, or what?

50:47.002 --> 50:49.337
You used to be the loudest...

50:50.338 --> 50:53.216
most garrulous mo-fo I knew.

50:54.718 --> 50:57.095
Put a couple of these in you,
you wouldn't shut up.

50:58.513 --> 51:01.058
Always a man for a rousing speech.

51:02.434 --> 51:04.478
The man you knew isn't here.

51:11.443 --> 51:13.612
Now, that's the million-dollar question,
isn't it?

51:14.905 --> 51:15.947
Literally.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.827
The man I knew left 12 years ago
to make a buy.

51:22.037 --> 51:24.539
Disappeared. Along with our money.

51:25.582 --> 51:26.917
Where did he go?

51:27.751 --> 51:29.044
The truth?

51:30.670 --> 51:32.923
The alternator on my truck went bad.

51:35.342 --> 51:36.468
Twelve years bad?

51:36.551 --> 51:39.471
Yeah, well, long enough
to get me in trouble at a bar...

51:40.305 --> 51:43.100
with a man who didn't like my tattoos
or my politics.

51:44.893 --> 51:47.020
Cost him his life and nearly mine.

51:49.981 --> 51:53.110
Staring at the floor of a jail cell...

51:55.237 --> 51:56.613
I thought my life was done.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.074
But then God sent a man...

51:59.950 --> 52:02.077
that showed me it wasn't a coincidence,

52:02.953 --> 52:04.412
my breaking down there.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.665
I wasn't lost.

52:07.332 --> 52:08.542
I was found.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.965
Danny.
He was just a kid when you left.

52:15.048 --> 52:18.009
Fourteen years old. Just a punk kid.

52:19.636 --> 52:22.097
Running messages and errands
around the clubhouse.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.057
You probably never looked at him twice.

52:25.225 --> 52:26.685
But he looked up to you.

52:27.477 --> 52:29.354
You were everything he wanted to be.

52:30.605 --> 52:33.275
Hell on wheels with no qualms
and no conscience.

52:34.776 --> 52:36.695
A true believer in what we stood for.

52:41.366 --> 52:42.868
We all thought that.

52:45.537 --> 52:47.330
You were a god.

52:48.623 --> 52:49.624
No.

52:50.876 --> 52:52.252
I was a sinner.

52:53.503 --> 52:55.130
But I've been born again.

52:56.047 --> 52:58.967
And now I'm with the people
who will inherit the earth.

53:00.760 --> 53:01.761
Yeah.

53:02.470 --> 53:03.680
Six feet of it.

53:06.808 --> 53:08.435
You know the price for betrayal.

53:10.145 --> 53:11.521
You know how this has to go down.

53:15.567 --> 53:17.027
To be redeemed...

53:18.403 --> 53:20.280
you gotta pay for your sins in full.

53:33.251 --> 53:34.544
I...

53:34.628 --> 53:36.004
I don't know how you do it.

53:36.963 --> 53:39.007
I literally just shot somebody,

53:39.090 --> 53:42.552
and the way that I feel right now,
I don't think that I'll ever do it again.

53:43.345 --> 53:47.390
I mean, I just keep seeing
how scared he was, you know? Like...

53:48.808 --> 53:51.478
Yeah. He got what he needed.

53:53.146 --> 53:54.898
-Seriously?
-Yup.

53:55.690 --> 53:58.151
Yeah, you're right.
You know, you are different.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.241
But I know you...

54:05.200 --> 54:07.202
I know you hated pulling that trigger.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.037
But you did it.

54:09.996 --> 54:11.206
That kept you alive.

54:12.707 --> 54:13.708
Yeah.

54:15.043 --> 54:16.670
But is that all there is now?

54:17.837 --> 54:19.172
That's it? It's just...

54:20.006 --> 54:21.258
alive or dead?

54:22.092 --> 54:23.635
Them or us?

54:25.011 --> 54:26.096
Yeah, I'm...

54:27.138 --> 54:30.225
Yeah, I'm gonna do whatever I can
to make that different for you.

54:32.143 --> 54:36.022
I just... I gotta deal with Bill, and
I'm gonna finish those Schultzes. I'm...

54:39.651 --> 54:42.320
You're gonna go and do
whatever it is that you want to do.

54:47.325 --> 54:48.785
What if Billy kills you?

54:48.868 --> 54:49.911
Nah.

54:51.454 --> 54:54.749
No. I'm not the one that dies, kid.

54:56.668 --> 54:58.420
I'm the one that does the killing.

55:01.464 --> 55:03.842
The thing is, every time
I try to be someone different,

55:03.925 --> 55:05.719
that's when the wrong people get hurt.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.230
This is such a total flustercluck.

55:18.440 --> 55:21.109
Shit.

55:21.484 --> 55:22.319
Yeah.

55:22.986 --> 55:24.446
"Flustercluck."

55:31.494 --> 55:32.996
Yes, it is, kid.

55:37.417 --> 55:38.585
Yes, it is.
