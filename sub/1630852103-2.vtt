Well, the build-out cost about $350,000.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.831
But what's in it cost another $300,000.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.875
Wow, so that's very, very valuable.

03:28.958 --> 03:32.128

Tons of celebrities live there,
like Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Drake,

04:01.366 --> 04:03.701
-I would say about five million.
-Five?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.995
But I would suggest doing 4,999,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.665
just because a lot of people, even agents,

04:08.748 --> 04:10.500
only look up to a certain number.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.795

but, again, it's up to French.

She's not. She's not at all.

Heather, she comes across so sweet,
but she's very easily swayed,

07:05.174 --> 07:09.804
and I just found her being very,
like, jelly-fishy with me, and--

07:09.887 --> 07:10.972
What's "jelly-fishy"?

07:11.055 --> 07:13.808
You know, 'cause, like,
jellyfishes have no spines,

07:13.891 --> 07:16.227

She, like, really goes with the current.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.527

she expresses about her friends,

07:24.610 --> 07:26.904
I don't know
how she expresses about her enemies.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.201

07:32.785 --> 07:35.663
-And then Davina, she left the office.
-[Vanessa] Yeah.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.665
[Christine] She works
at a different brokerage,

07:37.748 --> 07:40.460
and, I mean,
she's one of my closest friends.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.838
And then Mary and I
were really, really, really close.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.341
We were really good friends,
and then Chrishell joined the brokerage.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.843
-[Vanessa] Okay.
-[laughs]

07:48.926 --> 07:51.679
And, needless to say,
our dynamic changed a little bit.

07:51.762 --> 07:52.889
Okay. Why?

07:52.972 --> 07:55.099
I felt like her and Chrishell
got really close,

07:55.183 --> 07:56.642
and then we got to a point where

07:56.726 --> 07:59.103
these cliques
kind of started forming where…

08:00.021 --> 08:01.856
I wasn't invited to things.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.442
I thought she was loyal,
and I was really surprised.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.319
It's been hard for me.

08:06.402 --> 08:09.989
She actually became
really close to someone

08:10.072 --> 08:13.284
that I didn't expect her
to be really close to.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.244
-To who?
-[Christine] Um…

08:15.328 --> 08:16.662
Long story.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.581
-My ex-boyfriend…
-[Vanessa] Okay.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.376
…was dating this girl
at the same time he was dating me.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.253
I had no idea.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.254
[Vanessa] Oh, wow.

08:25.338 --> 08:31.427
I caught him red-handed
during the day with her.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.678
Wow.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.680
So we broke up,

08:34.764 --> 08:38.142
and Mary started
becoming really close with her.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.310
And who is she?

08:39.393 --> 08:41.229
[sighs] Her name's Emma.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.440
I know this happened years and years ago,

08:44.524 --> 08:47.401
but this is all coming back to life now,

08:47.485 --> 08:50.738
because I wasn't aware that Mary
continued her friendship with Emma

08:50.821 --> 08:52.114
after the cheating came out.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.950
That was really surprising to me.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.369
So it just feels like another betrayal.

08:56.452 --> 09:00.748
So Mary is friends with all the people
that have hurt you in some ways.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.126
That's why you feel
that you don't connect with her anymore.

Hey, Emma.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.965
Good, how are you?

09:51.048 --> 09:53.593
-Good to see you.
-[Emma] Nice to see you.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.679
[Jason] So Emma has been
at the Oppenheim Group for years.

09:56.762 --> 10:00.349
Unfortunately, in the last couple years,
she's been focusing on other endeavors.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.810
She goes back and forth to the East Coast,

10:02.893 --> 10:06.230
she's got several other businesses
that she's working on,

10:06.314 --> 10:09.567
and, quite honestly, I'm just hoping
that she can come back on full-time.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.777
-[Emma] Isn't it beautiful?
-[Jason] Yeah, it really is.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.405
My problem is every time I go to a house,
I want it.

10:14.488 --> 10:17.783
That's like me. Are you kidding me?
I wanna buy every listing I have.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.953
Every house that I go into,
I'm like, "Huh, I wanna buy that."

10:21.037 --> 10:22.955
So tell me about the guy, about the house.

10:23.039 --> 10:27.209
I was in Vegas having dinner
with Alesso, the DJ.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.754
-You know Alesso?
-[Jason] I've been to his concerts.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.340
[Emma] Of course.
He became an amazing client,

10:32.423 --> 10:36.260
and he bought this house
two and a half years ago for 5,850,

10:36.344 --> 10:38.471
and we're relisting it now.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.014
He wants to get a home in the Hills.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.516
-[Jason] What are you asking?
-[Emma] Six-four-nine-five.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.936
[Jason] Okay, so you sold it to him
for 5,850 two years ago.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.481
Yeah, the market's gone up.
That's not unreasonable.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.858
This is such an entertaining house.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.778
I like how some of the pool's covered,
so you don't get sun.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.364
[Emma] Sun, shade,
you have a little bit of everything.

These have never been used.

-[Emma] Or he just keeps it really clean.
-[Jason] No, this is…

11:09.126 --> 11:11.504
-I might see an empanada in the back.
-[Jason] What do you--

11:11.587 --> 11:13.422
Just kidding. You literally looked!

11:13.506 --> 11:14.548
[Jason] I'm hungry.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.258
So hungry, you would've eaten that.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.718
[Jason] Show me the rest.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.929

though, that business and real estate

the other day, in the office,

"You're coming, right?"

18:12.216 --> 18:15.344

'cause we've already started.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.762
-Thank you.
-[Mary] Is that for me?

18:16.845 --> 18:18.889
-Yes.
-[Mary] Thank you!

Well, I'm gonna let you guys
have your girls' night.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.685
-[Vanessa] Thanks for having me.
-[Romain] Of course.

-[Mary] Let's just sit here.
-Okay.

Yeah.

[all sigh]

18:27.731 --> 18:32.694
I'm honestly super excited
to join the company with you.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.405
I really appreciate
the love that you gave me,

18:35.489 --> 18:39.159
especially when I was sharing my story,
which is… You know, it was hard for me.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.953
-Yeah.
-So I didn't want to, like…

18:41.036 --> 18:43.413
It was like,
"I'm crying on my first day here."

18:43.497 --> 18:46.500
It's not necessarily un-normal
for people to cry

18:46.583 --> 18:48.460

18:48.544 --> 18:49.711
Yeah. So welcome.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.923
In acting, as I'm sure you know,

18:53.006 --> 18:55.634
it's sometimes such a nightmare
to work with some people.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.886
That's how I knew
you were gonna be amazing,

18:57.970 --> 19:01.890
because you came from the soap world,
and that's the only reason I was able to…

19:01.974 --> 19:03.475
-[Heather] Handle it?
-[Chrishell] Yeah.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.228
It was a lot thrown at me,
but because I was like,

19:06.311 --> 19:07.771
"Okay, at the end of the day,

19:07.855 --> 19:10.274
if I can deal with some
f the soap divas I've dealt with…"

with luxury real estate in L.A."

So I know you've got this.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.115
[Vanessa] I love it.

19:18.198 --> 19:21.910
We should, like, do like a soap night,
where we have a little acting night,

19:21.994 --> 19:23.871
and you guys can do your soap scenes.

19:23.954 --> 19:27.082
-Mary and I will, like, do our best.
-[Vanessa] Yeah.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.001
-How dare you?!
-How dare you, Mary?

19:29.084 --> 19:30.127
[Heather] Was that right?

19:30.210 --> 19:32.921
You've gotta lock your elbow
to really sell it.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.008
Ready? I'm gonna go that way first,
and then I'm gonna go that way.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.968
-Ready?
-[Vanessa] Nice!

19:38.051 --> 19:40.220

How fun. Oh, gosh.
What'd you think of everyone?

19:43.682 --> 19:44.850
I love all of you!

19:44.933 --> 19:47.311
I mean, all of you were super sweet to me,

19:47.394 --> 19:50.397
and I actually had lunch with Christine.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.815
She was very sweet,

19:51.899 --> 19:54.484
and she actually ended up
inviting me to her baby shower,

19:54.568 --> 19:56.069
-which was like "wow."
-Of course.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.323
I mean, she just met me
and, you know, it's super sweet.

19:59.907 --> 20:03.285
I have learned that Christine
can be one of the most calculated,

20:03.368 --> 20:05.746
manipulative people that I've ever known.

20:05.829 --> 20:10.709
I just don't think that anything she does
is not thought through,

20:10.792 --> 20:14.671
and there's a purpose behind it
that will eventually somehow serve her.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.382
But, you know, maybe I'm wrong.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.594
Maybe she genuinely
wants to befriend Vanessa.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.763
I doubt it.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.556
I want you to make your own decisions,

20:24.640 --> 20:29.353
but I also certainly don't want someone
to have the same experience that I had,

20:29.436 --> 20:31.396
because it took a toll on me,
it really did.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.565
I've had a long road with Christine.

20:33.649 --> 20:36.777
She's kind of burnt
all of us at this point,

20:36.860 --> 20:40.364
but especially when I was dealing
with the death of my dad,

20:40.447 --> 20:43.700
and the death now,
more recently, of my mother.

20:43.784 --> 20:48.247
Unnecessary rumors and drama
that she was trying to put out there,

20:48.330 --> 20:52.751
that I had to put all of my effort,
all of a sudden, into killing,

20:52.834 --> 20:54.670
because they weren't true.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.672
I just personally will
never get past that.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.882
-She kicked you when you were down.
-Yeah.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.968
-It was a moment--
-I'm sorry about your mom.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.511
-[Chrishell] Thank you.
-And your dad.

that it happened like that with you.

with someone that hurt her in the past

21:28.412 --> 21:31.456

and I said "Well, maybe she didn't know."

Emma's a total sweetheart.
