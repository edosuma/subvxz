00:05.538 --> 00:06.772
                          CLIFF:
                    Hey, Doc.   

00:06.806 --> 00:08.106
What's with the getup?          

00:08.141 --> 00:11.343
        As of this day,         
     I am changing my ways.     

00:11.378 --> 00:12.845
  You know, not too long ago,   

00:12.879 --> 00:14.880
    I used to be a healthy,     
    robust individual.          

00:14.914 --> 00:17.016
  Then I set foot in this bar.  

00:17.050 --> 00:20.085
Started sitting around for hours
when I should have been jogging.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.154
    Started to gorge myself     
      on snacks and sweets      

00:22.188 --> 00:23.689
    instead of health food.     

00:23.723 --> 00:25.290
              Well, now that I'm
                back on the road

00:25.325 --> 00:27.226
        to better health, I'm   
             taking you with me.

00:28.495 --> 00:30.496
                What, uh... what
            do you mean, Doc?   

00:30.530 --> 00:31.797
        Well, I've              
          signed us up          

00:31.831 --> 00:33.332
         for a physical         
        fitness program.        

00:33.366 --> 00:34.733
Geez, I don't                   
know, Doc.                      

00:34.768 --> 00:36.435
Sounds like an awful,           
awful lot of work.              

00:36.469 --> 00:37.703
      Yeah, I already took      
          into account          

00:37.737 --> 00:39.038
     your legendary sloth,      

00:39.072 --> 00:40.706
                  and to make it
                 easier for you,

00:40.740 --> 00:42.574
            I've hired a trainer
          to come here in person

00:42.609 --> 00:43.742
        to help you exercise.   

00:43.810 --> 00:45.511
      We tried that once.       

00:45.578 --> 00:47.179
         What, you had          
    a trained athlete           

00:47.213 --> 00:48.180
      who came here and...      

00:48.214 --> 00:49.214
         and helped you         
        work out?               

00:49.249 --> 00:50.215
                        Yeah.   

00:50.250 --> 00:51.650
      Well, what happened?      

00:51.685 --> 00:53.218
                Uh, hey, I don't
                  know, ask <i>him.</i>

00:53.253 --> 00:54.987
Uh, Paul?

        order the wing dings.   

02:31.851 --> 02:33.218
Well, maybe I                   
would like                      

02:33.253 --> 02:34.553
something different             
today, Norm.                    

02:34.587 --> 02:35.554
                     Yeah, okay.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.189
                Sammy, I'm gonna
                have the, uh,   

02:37.223 --> 02:38.357

 <i>and</i> butter,                    

02:40.660 --> 02:44.129
and, um, put some cheddar       
    on there, please.           

02:44.164 --> 02:46.231
 Oh, and, uh, some jack cheese. 

02:46.266 --> 02:47.499
          Bacon bits?           

02:47.534 --> 02:49.468
      No, no, I'm watching      
        my cholesterol.         

02:51.538 --> 02:53.205
            Cliffie?            

02:53.239 --> 02:55.140
            I'll have the, uh...

02:55.175 --> 02:56.775
              wing dings.

03:01.948 --> 03:04.216
              Oh...             

03:04.250 --> 03:06.919
Isn't that precious?            

03:06.953 --> 03:08.120
            I can hardly wait   

03:08.154 --> 03:10.656
                 till Sam and I 
                 have our baby. 

03:10.690 --> 03:11.690
                Carla, do you   
                    think I'm   

03:11.725 --> 03:12.791
                    gonna make a
                    good mother?

03:12.826 --> 03:14.426
        Nope.                   

03:16.463 --> 03:17.629
            What do you mean?   

03:17.664 --> 03:20.032
You asked me a question,        
I gave you an answer.           

03:20.066 --> 03:21.734
                    Yeah, but   
                    I'm serious.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.602
Well, I'm sorry,                
I'm just being honest.          

03:23.636 --> 03:24.837
                  No, you're not
                being honest.   

03:24.871 --> 03:26.405
              You're being mean.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.107
Sometimes you                   
get a two-fer.                  

03:30.210 --> 03:31.910
            So you are saying   
            that you don't think

03:31.945 --> 03:33.545
                 that I can take
                 care of a baby?

03:33.580 --> 03:34.680
You kidding?                    
I don't think you               

03:34.714 --> 03:35.781
could take care                 
of an egg.                      

03:35.849 --> 03:38.083
                    Oh, come on.
No, really,                     
really.                         

03:38.151 --> 03:39.351
I'll bet you five bucks         

03:39.386 --> 03:40.953
you can't take care             
of this egg                     

03:40.987 --> 03:42.388
until Friday night              
at closing time.                

03:43.990 --> 03:45.090
                     Five bucks?

03:45.125 --> 03:47.026
    Yeah.                       
                     You're on--
                         thanks.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.495
                     (splatters)

03:52.966 --> 03:54.633
                     Okay, I was
                     practicing.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.402
                     Now, start!

04:00.240 --> 04:01.607
             Norm, are you busy?

04:01.675 --> 04:03.976
                Oh, good one.   
                    (giggles)   

04:04.044 --> 04:05.277
            Thanks, I thought   
                of it last night

04:05.311 --> 04:06.378
         in the shower.         

04:06.413 --> 04:07.446
            (laughs)            

04:07.480 --> 04:08.547
             Norm?              
                        Yeah.   

04:08.581 --> 04:09.715
  Frasier and I were wondering  

04:09.749 --> 04:11.817
              if you would paint
          our living room today.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.619
Today?                          
What's the rush?                

04:13.687 --> 04:15.487
      Well, yesterday,          
      little Frederick          

04:15.522 --> 04:16.922
     was playing fireman...     
Mm-hmm.                         

04:16.956 --> 04:18.656
      ...with the mustard       
  and ketchup squeeze bottles   

04:18.692 --> 04:21.694
and, uh, he put out             
our living room wall.           

04:23.229 --> 04:24.663
He is a dickens.                

04:24.698 --> 04:26.865
         I found it difficult to
        keep a straight face.   

04:29.369 --> 04:32.738
        Well, I'm really        
 kind of taking this week off.  

04:32.772 --> 04:35.374
        From what?              

04:35.408 --> 04:37.676
          From Vera--           
she's visiting her mother.      

04:37.744 --> 04:39.244
     Ooh, nothing serious,      
            I hope.             

04:39.279 --> 04:41.113
        No, no, no, no,         
they're just changing that tire 

04:41.147 --> 04:42.348
  that hangs from her ceiling.  

04:42.382 --> 04:43.916
        (laughing)              

04:43.950 --> 04:45.050
  I can take care of you guys.  

04:45.218 --> 04:46.652
      I can use the work.       

04:46.686 --> 04:48.921
Let's go check it out.          

04:48.955 --> 04:50.189
Tell you what, I...             

04:50.223 --> 04:52.091
I think I can swing             
the whole thing today           

04:52.125 --> 04:54.093
    for, uh...                  

04:54.127 --> 04:55.761
what do you say, $400?          

04:55.795 --> 04:58.430
  Uh, that's a little pricey,   
        isn't it?               

04:58.465 --> 05:00.466
        Uh, right, well,        
    say $200 and, uh,           

05:00.500 --> 05:01.934
      you supply the food       
         and the beer?          

05:01.968 --> 05:03.902
          $400, it is.          

05:11.444 --> 05:14.713
            Say, Norm, what kind
              of roller is that?

05:14.748 --> 05:16.582
I don't know, Fras.             

05:16.616 --> 05:19.351
        They have, uh, different
            kinds of rollers?   

05:19.386 --> 05:20.352
Uh...                           

05:20.387 --> 05:22.688
yeah, probably do.              

05:22.722 --> 05:24.423
                    Suppose, uh,
                    some of them

05:24.457 --> 05:25.958
                 are better than
                     the others?

05:25.992 --> 05:28.060
Uh, yeah, yeah,                 
I suppose.                      

05:28.094 --> 05:30.496
    This one's okay, though,    
        Fras, trust me.         

05:30.530 --> 05:32.097
    Oh, oh, yeah, no.           

05:32.132 --> 05:35.134
      I was just wondering      
         about rollers.         

05:35.168 --> 05:38.270
 Don't you have anything to do, 
you know, like work or anything?

05:38.304 --> 05:40.072
    No, no, don't have          
         to work today.         

05:40.140 --> 05:42.041
             And, Lilith doesn't
                 let me watch TV

05:42.108 --> 05:45.144
                      during the
                  daytime, so...

05:45.178 --> 05:46.812
        Say, is... can I help   
              you with anything?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.480
                I mean, stir the
                paint, maybe?   

05:48.515 --> 05:50.582
No, uh, they, uh...             
they shook it up                

05:50.617 --> 05:51.917
over at the, uh,                
paint store.                    

05:51.951 --> 05:53.652
             Yeah, right, those,
              uh, those machines

05:53.687 --> 05:55.387
            that, yeah, shake   
                the paint, yeah.
Yeah.                           

05:55.422 --> 05:56.588
                  Say, you know,
                    that's...   

05:56.623 --> 05:58.223
        I wonder who invented   
                that-- that's...

05:58.291 --> 06:00.659
 There's a guy that really made 

06:00.694 --> 06:02.561
a worthwhile contribution,      
        you know?               

06:02.629 --> 06:04.163
                         I mean,

06:04.230 --> 06:05.397
        if he <i>was</i> a guy.        

06:05.432 --> 06:07.232
I mean, he could have been      
    a woman, I guess.           

06:07.267 --> 06:08.834
    Isn't that interesting?     
     Oh, why would I assume     

06:08.868 --> 06:10.903
         just right off         
that that would be a man?       

06:12.072 --> 06:14.173
     Frasier, I'm starting      
         to miss Cliff.         

06:16.209 --> 06:17.343
                Right, right,   
                          right.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.977
            How's Norm doing?   

06:19.012 --> 06:20.446
Oh, fine, I guess.              

06:20.513 --> 06:22.581
             (awkward laughter):
                        Oh, say,

06:22.615 --> 06:24.483
you know, Norm, the...          
the guy on <i>This Old House</i>       

06:24.517 --> 06:25.684
says that you                   
should apply paint              

06:25.719 --> 06:27.920
with, uh, vertical strokes.     

06:27.987 --> 06:29.688
             Yeah,              
     what's <i>This Old House?</i>     

06:29.756 --> 06:30.989
Well, it's a show on PBS.       

06:31.157 --> 06:32.825
          What's PBS?           

06:34.160 --> 06:38.163
Tell me you didn't see that     
coming a mile away.             

06:38.198 --> 06:39.698
      Well, you know, I...      
        I was just              

06:39.733 --> 06:42.201
 trying to point out that, uh,  
    it seemed a little silly    

06:42.235 --> 06:45.904
for a... a television show      
to waste all that, uh, air time,

06:45.939 --> 06:47.606
            um, explaining to   
             paint a certain way

06:47.640 --> 06:49.508
  when you can just slap it on  
          willy-nilly.          

06:50.610 --> 06:52.244
Look, I'd love                  
to stay here all day            

06:52.278 --> 06:54.013
and defend myself,              
but I can't reach               

06:54.047 --> 06:55.481
that top spot                   
so I'm gonna go home            

06:55.515 --> 06:56.415
and get my big ladder.          

06:56.449 --> 06:57.483
                 Well, you could
                        reach it

06:57.517 --> 06:58.584
from the top                    
of the ladder.                  

06:58.618 --> 06:59.918
      Oh, no, no, you see       
        that, uh,               

06:59.953 --> 07:01.220
  sticker on the ladder there?  

07:01.254 --> 07:02.721
You're not supposed to go       
        above that step.        

07:02.756 --> 07:04.523
Oh, come on, you're             
just being a big baby.          

07:04.557 --> 07:05.858
Look, you're almost done,       
and, uh,                        

07:05.892 --> 07:07.993
you know, you don't want it     
to dry two different colors.    

07:08.028 --> 07:09.962
         Oh, don't tell me-- the
        guy from <i>This Old House?</i>

07:09.996 --> 07:11.196
Well, look, if he               
wasn't a professional,          

07:11.231 --> 07:12.631
he wouldn't be the guy          
from <i>This Old House,</i>            

07:12.665 --> 07:14.867
he'd just be some guy,          
all right?                      

07:14.901 --> 07:16.502
Now, come on,                   
get up there.                   
                No, what, I'm...

07:16.536 --> 07:18.270
             I'm gonna get hurt,
              fall down? No way!

07:18.304 --> 07:20.372
Oh, all right, you big baby,    
I'll do it myself.              

07:20.407 --> 07:21.540
     Frasier, come on now.      

07:21.574 --> 07:22.941
Hand me that roller.            

07:22.976 --> 07:24.376
                 Frasier, relax,
                    will you?   
Whoa!                           

07:24.411 --> 07:24.943
              Aah!              

07:30.750 --> 07:33.652
            Okay, so maybe it is
             a little hazardous.

07:39.926 --> 07:41.927
Norm, I'm sorry.                

07:41.961 --> 07:43.962
I'm so sorry.                   

07:43.997 --> 07:46.331
              All I can say is I
                am so, so sorry.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.733
            What else can I say?

07:47.767 --> 07:49.768
      I know something you      
        can <i>stop</i> saying.        

07:49.803 --> 07:50.803
Here you are, Norm.             

07:50.837 --> 07:53.238
         Oh, thank you.         

07:53.273 --> 07:55.607
                        FRASIER:
                      Now, Norm,
                     Norm, here,

07:55.642 --> 07:56.942
    don't lift up your neck     
        like that.              

07:56.976 --> 07:58.310
  Remember what Dr. Feld said.  

07:58.345 --> 07:59.678
You've got a bruised disk       

07:59.713 --> 08:00.879
              and you don't want
                 to aggravate it

08:00.914 --> 08:02.548
                    by moving   
                     in any way.

08:02.582 --> 08:05.918
    Well, at least it won't     
affect my lifestyle much.       

08:05.952 --> 08:08.787
Can you just drop me off        
at home, Frasier?               

08:08.822 --> 08:10.489
                     Okay, Norm,
                just be careful.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.358
                No, no, we... we
            can't take him home.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.559
             Vera's out of town.

08:13.593 --> 08:14.927
            Can you imagine Norm
              just sitting there

08:14.961 --> 08:15.928
                    all alone in
                      his house,

08:15.962 --> 08:17.629
            helpless in front   
                      of the TV?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.965
Hang onto your hat,             
but yes.                        

08:21.601 --> 08:23.369
                Look, Lilith,   

08:23.403 --> 08:25.204
                     the least I
                  owe Norm is...

08:25.238 --> 08:26.705
                  is the comfort
                    of our home.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.774
          I mean, at least until
                Vera comes back.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.409
I see what this is.             

08:30.443 --> 08:32.945
You want your little friend     
to stay over.                   

08:34.080 --> 08:37.649
                Well, he doesn't
                      move much.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.486
All right, if you clean up after
     him, you can keep him,     

08:41.520 --> 08:43.889
    but the first time          
 I have to do it, out he goes.  

08:43.923 --> 08:45.724
    Do you hear that, Norm?     
         You can stay!          

08:46.993 --> 08:49.361
 Say, listen, tell her you want 

08:49.396 --> 08:51.497
to watch some television.       

08:57.704 --> 08:59.271
    800.                        

09:00.240 --> 09:01.974
                     Literature.

09:02.008 --> 09:06.045
            808.83.             

09:06.079 --> 09:08.347
            Short monologues.   

09:08.381 --> 09:12.251
 Boy, Mr. Clavin, you sure know 
your Dewey Decimal System.      

09:12.285 --> 09:13.952
        (phone ringing)         

09:16.156 --> 09:18.290
            Cheers.             

09:18.324 --> 09:19.591
     Hey, guys, it's Norm.      

09:19.626 --> 09:21.060
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

09:23.196 --> 09:24.830
Hey, what's                     
shaking, man?                   

09:24.864 --> 09:25.931
(laughing)                      

09:25.965 --> 09:28.200
Where's he come up              
with these things?              

09:28.234 --> 09:30.035
That's great.                   

09:30.070 --> 09:31.403
So how                          
are you doing, huh?             

09:31.438 --> 09:33.072
        Ooh, ouch.              

09:33.106 --> 09:34.940
  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.   

09:34.974 --> 09:37.509
     Well, uh, we're gonna      
     miss you around here.      

09:37.544 --> 09:39.144
         Take it easy.          

09:39.179 --> 09:40.379
        Yeah, all right,        
            bye-bye.            

09:40.413 --> 09:42.815
        Poor guy-- whoa.        
                        What?   

09:42.849 --> 09:45.250
    Threw his back out over     
    at, uh, Frasier's house.    

09:45.285 --> 09:47.453
        Can't move--            
Lilith's taking care of him.    

09:47.487 --> 09:48.854
            Ooh, poor Norm.     
Yeah.                           

09:48.888 --> 09:50.289
                        Oh, boy.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.591
              Oh, I hope... hope
            it's not serious.   

09:52.625 --> 09:53.892
            I mean, if anything,
                    uh, happened

09:53.927 --> 09:55.661
         to the big guy, I don't
            know what I'd do.   

09:55.695 --> 09:57.229
Yeah, it's too bad              
it takes something bad          

09:57.263 --> 09:58.931
to happen for us                
to really appreciate him.       

09:58.965 --> 10:00.065
                     Yeah, yeah,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.234
             it really makes you
            stop and think, huh?

10:02.268 --> 10:03.836
         Flip you for his stool.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.404
Heads.                          

10:06.373 --> 10:08.440
              Hey!              

10:12.979 --> 10:14.980
Lilith, um,                     

10:15.015 --> 10:16.448
      could you put a head      
        on this, please?        

10:17.584 --> 10:20.052
    Norm, for two days now,     

10:20.086 --> 10:21.820
        I've been seeing        
      to your every need.       

10:21.888 --> 10:24.223
            I think it's time we
              had a little talk.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.158
Oh, great,                      
could I go first?               

10:26.192 --> 10:28.360
'Cause there's something I've   
been really wanting to say.     

10:28.395 --> 10:29.528
(takes deep breath)             

10:29.562 --> 10:31.997
Lilith, you and I               
are very different people.      

10:32.032 --> 10:34.066
I mean, look                    
at you.                         

10:34.100 --> 10:37.036
You're successful,              
ambitious,                      

10:37.103 --> 10:38.303
you've got a...                 

10:38.338 --> 10:40.005
a great career,                 
lovely family.                  

10:40.040 --> 10:41.273
Me, I'm just a guy              

10:41.307 --> 10:43.308
     who sits on a barstool     

10:43.343 --> 10:46.311
     and hangs out all day      
    with his dorky friends.     

10:46.346 --> 10:50.215
I don't know, I guess I've      
     always sort of felt...     

10:50.250 --> 10:52.117
         sorry for you.         

10:55.321 --> 10:57.956
The point I'm tryin'            
to make here, Lilith,           

10:57.991 --> 11:00.959
is that even though             
I don't understand              

11:00.994 --> 11:02.961
half the stuff                  
you guys talk about,            

11:02.996 --> 11:04.296
quantum physics                 
and stuff...                    
                        Oh.     

11:04.330 --> 11:05.764
              Oh, quantum, that,
                    that's easy.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.966
  Once you accept the duality   
            of light            

11:08.001 --> 11:10.302
as both a particle and a wave...
Yeah,                           

11:10.337 --> 11:11.470
    yeah, yeah, yeah,           
        yeah, whatever.         

11:11.504 --> 11:13.038
    Who, who cares, really?     

11:13.073 --> 11:15.874
     The point is, Lilith,      

11:15.909 --> 11:17.976
that I realize that you've      
    been trying to help me.     

11:18.011 --> 11:20.412
And I appreciate                
that.                           

11:20.447 --> 11:21.947
    And in the future,          

11:21.981 --> 11:25.751
I, for one, will not be so quick
     to just blow you off.      

11:27.854 --> 11:30.055
    Sadly, Norm, that's one     
      of the nicest things      

11:30.090 --> 11:31.724
anyone's ever said to me.       

11:33.860 --> 11:36.328
    Thank you for that gift.    

11:36.363 --> 11:38.097
        (doorbell rings)        
Oh, uh,                         
could you get that?             

11:38.164 --> 11:39.698
That's probably the pizza       
that I ordered.                 

11:39.733 --> 11:41.333
I had to put it                 
on your MasterCard.             

11:41.368 --> 11:43.135
  Uh, thank you for that gift.  

11:45.038 --> 11:46.872
            Yoo-hoo!            
         Anybody home?          

11:46.906 --> 11:48.207
Hey, Lilith,                    
how're ya doin'?                

11:48.375 --> 11:50.009
                         Normie!
            Cliffy!             

11:50.043 --> 11:51.677
                      Hey, how's
                    it goin'?   

11:51.711 --> 11:52.911
              Well, I was in the
                neighborhood,   

11:52.946 --> 11:54.146
                    so I thought
                    I'd stop in.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.214
Yeah? You finished              
your route?                     

11:55.248 --> 11:56.882
Well, no,                       
they can wait.                  

11:56.916 --> 11:59.385
Heck, there's, uh,              

11:59.419 --> 12:01.053
nothin' happenin' today.        

12:01.087 --> 12:03.022
Well, I, uh, the biggest        
thing today is, uh,             

12:03.056 --> 12:05.057
some old lady wrote             
some guy sayin'                 

12:05.091 --> 12:06.592
that she was                    
his natural mother.             

12:06.626 --> 12:09.962
    It's a soap opera           
        out there, Norm.        

12:09.996 --> 12:11.030
Really?                         
             Yeah.              

12:11.064 --> 12:12.031
                     Well, well,

12:12.065 --> 12:15.034
Norm and Cliff in my home.      

12:15.068 --> 12:18.003
     Usually at this point      
  I wake up drenched in sweat.  

12:19.339 --> 12:22.141
Oh, now                         
there's an image, huh?          

12:22.208 --> 12:23.542
    Now, now, Cliffy.           

12:23.643 --> 12:24.977
      Back off now, Cliff.      

12:25.045 --> 12:26.645
Lilith and I have               
been talking.                   

12:26.680 --> 12:28.447
Turns out she's just            
regular folks.                  

12:28.481 --> 12:29.715
Sure. Sure she is.              

12:29.749 --> 12:31.116
Yeah, so, uh,                   

12:31.151 --> 12:33.218
what's a guy gotta do           
to get a drink around here?     

12:33.253 --> 12:34.620
        (doorbell rings)        
                Cliff,          

12:34.754 --> 12:36.722
        this is not a tavern.   

12:36.756 --> 12:39.324
This is my home.                
Do you see a bartender?         

12:39.359 --> 12:40.592
            Do you see any beer?

12:40.627 --> 12:43.429
        Ho, there he is!        

12:43.463 --> 12:44.596
Sammy!                          
All right!                      

12:44.631 --> 12:46.131
            Normie can't come   
                    to the beer,

12:46.166 --> 12:47.466
             then the beer comes
                      to Normie!

12:47.500 --> 12:48.634
All right!                      
                    Hey, Lilith,

12:48.668 --> 12:51.003
             want to get us some
                  glasses there?

13:00.613 --> 13:03.916
You know, Norm,                 
it's a little bit strange       

13:03.950 --> 13:05.484
watchin' TV                     
at eye level.                   

13:08.421 --> 13:10.689
                 You get used to
                     it, though.

13:10.757 --> 13:13.926
No, actually, you probably won't
     get used to it, Cliff.     

13:13.960 --> 13:15.961
        Remember,               
    you're just stopping by.    

13:15.995 --> 13:17.996
Oh, I don't know                
there, Lilith.                  

13:18.031 --> 13:21.166
I mean, uh, Sam's pourin',      
you got ESPN.                   

13:21.201 --> 13:23.469
It's just like Cheers.          

13:23.503 --> 13:25.571
Yes, but it's not Cheers.       

13:25.605 --> 13:28.040
  This is a private home, and   
 comfortable though it may be,  

13:28.074 --> 13:30.042
    I'm sure you have           
      other things to do.       

13:30.110 --> 13:32.011
You know, Cliff, Lilith's right.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.879
You've got your route to finish.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.447
We'll be here when you get back.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.953
         Uh, gentlemen,         
 I'm afraid the party is over.  

13:40.987 --> 13:42.121
          As enjoyable          

13:42.155 --> 13:43.722
            as this has been,   

13:43.757 --> 13:45.657
    I'm going to have           
      to ask you to leave.      

13:47.727 --> 13:50.662
Well, this must                 
be the place.                   

13:50.697 --> 13:52.731
                    He drives   
                  like a maniac.

13:52.766 --> 13:53.766
How would you know?             
You were playing                

13:53.800 --> 13:55.000
with my radio                   
the whole way.                  

13:55.035 --> 13:56.835
              How can you listen
                to that crap?   
             Oh.                

13:56.870 --> 13:58.837
SAM:                            
Hey, guys, huh?                 

13:58.872 --> 14:00.339
What'll you have                
here?                           

14:00.373 --> 14:01.573
How about a beer?               
     Oh, listen, everyone,      

14:01.608 --> 14:03.509
  Norm needs peace and quiet.   

14:03.543 --> 14:05.344
        For that matter,        
      so do Frasier and I.      

14:05.378 --> 14:06.745
    So if you don't mind...     

14:06.780 --> 14:07.713
          Wing dings!           

14:07.747 --> 14:09.381
Get 'em while they're hot!      

14:09.416 --> 14:11.050
          Paul! Phil!           

14:11.084 --> 14:12.718
                Good to see you.
                    Say, listen,

14:12.752 --> 14:14.386
    those directions weren't too
         complicated, were they?

14:14.421 --> 14:15.554
            Oh, no.             
                    Look, honey,

14:15.588 --> 14:17.823
             it's Phil and Paul!

14:17.857 --> 14:20.659
 May I see you in the kitchen,  
            darling?            

14:27.200 --> 14:30.035
            (crash)             

14:35.342 --> 14:36.942
         I'll just, uh,         

14:36.976 --> 14:39.044
I'll put in another batch.      

14:44.250 --> 14:48.987
      (soul music playing)      

14:54.227 --> 14:56.962
            Frasier.            

14:57.030 --> 14:59.932
                        Frasier.

14:59.966 --> 15:03.402
Doctor, are you listening to me?

15:03.436 --> 15:05.404
        Yes, yes.               

15:05.438 --> 15:06.739
      Now please continue.      

15:08.842 --> 15:10.809
I hate it                       
when you do that.               

15:10.844 --> 15:12.811
Say, what time is it?           

15:12.846 --> 15:14.146
                    It's 1:00 in
                    the morning,

15:14.180 --> 15:16.248
            and your friends are
            still downstairs.   

15:16.282 --> 15:17.683
Oh, just try to ignore it,      
            Lilith.             

15:17.717 --> 15:19.585
  It's only for a couple more   
             days.              
                          I will

15:19.619 --> 15:20.652
         not ignore it!         

15:20.687 --> 15:22.221
    Now go down there           
      and get rid of them.      

15:22.255 --> 15:23.455
I can't, dear.                  

15:23.490 --> 15:24.456
  I'm the one that hurt Norm.   

15:24.491 --> 15:25.824
      I feel responsible.       

15:25.892 --> 15:28.827
      But you're not responsible
                 for the others.

15:28.862 --> 15:32.064
Yeah, but, you don't            
understand, dear.               

15:32.098 --> 15:34.900
You get one,                    
you get them all.               

15:34.934 --> 15:38.404
It's like a hive                
mentality.                      

15:38.438 --> 15:41.607
Norm must                       
be their queen.                 

15:41.641 --> 15:43.575
                      Get rid of
                      them, now!

15:43.610 --> 15:45.077
And if I don't?                 

15:45.111 --> 15:48.047
Would you like to ever see me   
        naked again in the '90s?

15:51.117 --> 15:53.919
You know, that would            
be more effective               

15:53.953 --> 15:56.155
      if you didn't use it      
        every time              

15:56.189 --> 15:59.158
        you ever want me        
        to do something.        

15:59.192 --> 16:02.027
              ¶ ¶               

16:02.062 --> 16:04.163
                        FRASIER:
              All right, people,
            enough is enough.   

16:04.197 --> 16:06.131
                (music stops)   
                            SAM:
            Oh, come on, man.   

16:09.235 --> 16:12.171
        (music resumes)         

16:17.110 --> 16:18.577
    Stop it right now!          
         (music stops)          

16:18.611 --> 16:20.813
     I want you people out      
          of my house!          

16:20.847 --> 16:23.582
            Gee, Lilith,        
        what's wrong?           

16:23.616 --> 16:24.783
                    You've taken

16:24.818 --> 16:26.385
                advantage of our
                    hospitality.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.187
     You should be ashamed      
         of yourselves.         

16:28.254 --> 16:30.689
 Lilith, don't you think you're 
overreacting a little bit?      

16:30.724 --> 16:32.191
         (phone rings)          

16:32.225 --> 16:33.425
            Cheers.             

16:34.594 --> 16:36.695
             This is not Cheers.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.530
Call back, huh?                 

16:38.565 --> 16:40.032
And you!                        

16:40.066 --> 16:41.700
I thought you were              
getting rid of them.            

16:41.735 --> 16:43.769
  Well, I asked them to leave,  
    and they said no.           

16:43.803 --> 16:45.604
              You never asked us
                 to leave, Fras.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.573
      Shut up, Cliff, I'm       
    in a little pickle here.    

16:47.607 --> 16:50.409
I will not have my home         
turned into a circus.           

16:50.443 --> 16:51.844
There is only                   
one person                      

16:51.878 --> 16:53.412
who has any right               
to be here.                     

16:53.480 --> 16:54.747
        Is it me?               

16:54.848 --> 16:56.749
Fat chance, mister!             

16:56.816 --> 16:58.117
I'm talking                     
about Nor...                    

16:58.151 --> 17:00.019
Where the hell is               
Norm?                           

17:00.053 --> 17:01.720
          Well, he said his back
              was feelin' better

17:01.755 --> 17:02.988
                  so he, uh, hit
                     the bricks.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.523
                        Yeah.   
I think he went                 
to Cheers.                      

17:06.593 --> 17:09.595
 And you people are still here? 

17:09.628 --> 17:12.431
    If you're not gone          
    by the time I get back,     

17:12.464 --> 17:14.433
  Frasier, you're a dead man!   

17:14.467 --> 17:16.669
        Do you hear me?         

17:19.071 --> 17:20.839
          (door slams)          

17:26.311 --> 17:28.446
    Carla...                    

17:28.481 --> 17:30.115
                    I did it.   

17:30.150 --> 17:33.452
It's almost closing time,       
and here's my little egg.       

17:33.486 --> 17:34.953
                 Safe and sound.

17:34.988 --> 17:35.988
                         Pay up.

17:36.022 --> 17:38.991
Darn the luck!                  

17:39.025 --> 17:40.993
    (sighs)                     

17:41.027 --> 17:43.696
Say, uh, you don't have         
change for a 20, do you?        

17:43.730 --> 17:45.364
            Where did you get   
                 all that money?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.965
Well, I bet some                
of the guys                     

17:47.000 --> 17:48.600
that I could make you           
carry an egg                    

17:48.635 --> 17:50.202
around the bar                  
for three days running.         

17:52.772 --> 17:54.707
I won 150 bucks.                

17:54.741 --> 17:56.475
Here's your five.               

17:56.509 --> 17:58.677
    Go crazy.                   

17:58.745 --> 18:00.646
             The important thing
             to remember here is

18:00.714 --> 18:02.181
         that I proved my point.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.449
What did you prove?             

18:03.483 --> 18:05.517
That you could take care        
of an egg?                      

18:05.585 --> 18:07.419
(chuckles)                      

18:07.487 --> 18:10.122
You know, babies are a lot      
bigger and heavier.             

18:10.156 --> 18:12.958
Now, if you could,              
say, uh,                        

18:12.992 --> 18:15.427
carry a watermelon...           

18:15.462 --> 18:19.398
say,                            
between your legs,              

18:19.466 --> 18:21.367
from one end of the bar         
to the other,                   

18:21.434 --> 18:23.802
and cluck like a chicken,       
now, that would prove           

18:23.837 --> 18:25.104
that you're ready               
for motherhood.                 

18:26.139 --> 18:28.574
              Good night, Carla.

18:33.747 --> 18:35.714
Here's your 20,                 
Carla.                          

18:35.749 --> 18:37.683
I thought                       
she'd do it.                    

18:42.655 --> 18:43.722
             Norm!              

18:43.790 --> 18:45.891
Oh, no,                         
Dr. Sternin-Crane,              

18:45.959 --> 18:47.259
you're supposed                 
to yell "Norm"                  

18:47.293 --> 18:48.894
when he comes                   
in the door.                    

18:48.928 --> 18:49.895
Don't worry.                    

18:49.929 --> 18:52.564
It took me a little while       
to get used to it, too.         

18:52.599 --> 18:54.233
What's wrong, Lilith?           

18:54.267 --> 18:56.068
            What the hell are   
                 you doing here?

18:56.102 --> 18:58.170
Well, my back started feelin'   
a lot better, and, uh,          

18:58.204 --> 19:00.339
I was really getting            
kinda tired of those guys.      

19:00.373 --> 19:02.741
            Norm, perhaps you'll
          understand an analogy.

19:02.776 --> 19:04.176
                Have you ever   
                    had a dog   

19:04.277 --> 19:05.477
                     and the dog
                      had fleas?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.712
                But then when   
                the dog left,   

19:06.746 --> 19:08.547
                  your house was
                 still infested?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.549
        Oh, yeah,               
      that happened to me.      

19:10.583 --> 19:11.884
     Only it wasn't a dog.      

19:11.918 --> 19:13.218
         It was a pig.          

19:13.253 --> 19:15.721
And we had fleas the size       
         of golf balls.         

19:15.755 --> 19:17.389
                  Woody, I'm not
                     interested.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.191
            I'm trying to have a
         conversation with Norm.

19:19.225 --> 19:22.294
Whoa, golf balls, huh?          

19:22.328 --> 19:24.863
  It got so bad we had to bomb  
        the whole house.        

19:24.898 --> 19:25.931
    Wow.                        

19:25.965 --> 19:27.766
Those flea bombs                
are great, huh?                 

19:27.801 --> 19:29.435
      What's a flea bomb?       

19:29.469 --> 19:30.936
                        Stop it!

19:30.970 --> 19:32.905
                Just stop it!   

19:36.176 --> 19:37.676
        I came by to tell you   

19:37.711 --> 19:40.479
     that your behavior has been
            unconscionably rude.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.314
            You let your friends
                overrun my home,

19:42.349 --> 19:43.582
                and then when   
                      you leave,

19:43.616 --> 19:44.817
             you don't even have
                     the decency

19:44.851 --> 19:45.984
                    to take them
                    with you.   

19:46.019 --> 19:48.821
                    That's all I
                    have to say.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.456
                     Good night.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.324
Wait, wait, Lilith,             
Lilith, wait a minute.          

19:52.359 --> 19:54.460
            Now, look, you're   
            absolutely right,   

19:54.527 --> 19:56.495
                  and I'm sorry.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.596
                         (sighs)

19:57.630 --> 19:58.931
                    Well, you're
                     up already.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.366
             You know, why don't
                  you just relax

20:00.400 --> 20:01.500
            and have a drink?   

20:01.534 --> 20:03.635
                  Well, come on.
                    You-you took

20:03.670 --> 20:04.903
    care of me for two days.    

20:04.938 --> 20:07.006
     The least I can do is      
        buy you a drink.        

20:07.073 --> 20:08.807
            Come on, come on.   

20:08.908 --> 20:11.443
 Look, you can sit on my stool. 

20:11.478 --> 20:13.479
                            Huh?

20:13.513 --> 20:15.414
                        Yeah.   

20:17.117 --> 20:19.018
Woods, scotch.                  

20:20.720 --> 20:22.488
         I may as well.         

20:22.522 --> 20:25.524
 My house is filled with people 
          who hate me.          

20:25.558 --> 20:28.560
    They're all angry at me     
because I spoiled the big party.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.229
            I'm the wet blanket.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.663
                 I'm the drudge.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.633
I'm the big party pooper.       

20:34.668 --> 20:36.802
Stop me when you disagree.      

20:36.836 --> 20:38.771
            I will.             

20:40.240 --> 20:43.342
        You know, Norm,         
 you may find this surprising,  

20:43.376 --> 20:46.712
  but I'm somewhat off-putting  
        to most people.         

20:46.746 --> 20:50.282
                No, no, it's,   
                      it's true.

20:50.316 --> 20:51.984
            I don't have many   
                        friends.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.920
I've never been very good       
    at making friends.          

20:54.954 --> 20:57.389
I think it's easy,              
Lilith.                         

20:57.424 --> 21:00.392
Um, you just have to relax      
a bit, you know?                

21:00.427 --> 21:02.861
Just sort                       
of loosen up.                   

21:02.896 --> 21:04.563
    You mean just be myself?    

21:04.597 --> 21:06.598
    No.                         

21:06.633 --> 21:08.600
Uh, you weren't                 
listening.                      

21:08.635 --> 21:10.269
Just relax.                     

21:10.303 --> 21:11.970
Loosen up.                      

21:12.005 --> 21:14.940
    Okay, I'll try it.          

21:14.974 --> 21:16.909
            (sighs)             

21:18.445 --> 21:21.447
Oh, wow, this feels much better.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.248
        See?                    

21:23.283 --> 21:25.417
            I've been looking at
                 this all wrong.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.152
      I'm going to go back      
          to my house,          

21:27.187 --> 21:29.221
  and I'm going to be the life  
         of that party.         

21:29.255 --> 21:30.789
        And it won't be         
    that disorganized,          

21:30.824 --> 21:32.691
        carousing fun they've   
                    been having.

21:32.726 --> 21:35.194
          It's going to be good,
        clean, organized fun.   

21:35.228 --> 21:37.696
          We'll play Pictionary,
                 then Boticelli,

21:37.731 --> 21:39.365
              then it's Charades
                      till dawn.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.867
         I'll rush home         
 and type up a party schedule.  

21:41.901 --> 21:43.402
    I'll make copies.           

21:43.436 --> 21:47.072
Oh, I wonder if they have a copy
center open at this hour.       

21:47.107 --> 21:48.340
            I know.             

21:48.375 --> 21:51.310
    Why not make a game out     
     of trying to find one?     

21:55.749 --> 21:57.983
      Frasier, it's Norm.       

21:58.018 --> 22:00.319
      Get out of the house      
      while you still can.
