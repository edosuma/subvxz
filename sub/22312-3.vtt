Why, you guys, of course.
I've told my mom all about you.

13:28.432 --> 13:32.937
Wait, isn't your mom,
like, a real-life queen?

13:33.020 --> 13:34.396
Uh-huh. Why?

13:34.480 --> 13:39.026
Uh, I've never met a queen
before. What if I mess up?

13:39.109 --> 13:40.486
[CHUCKLES] You won't.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.571
Aren't you worried we'll embarrass you?

I mean, what do I say? What
do I do? Do I bow? Do I curtsy?

Aw, you don't have to
do any of that stuff.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.580
- We don't?
- No, you just have to be polite.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.251
Mummy always says that good
manners make a difference.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.016
So we just have to remember to say

13:58.023 --> 14:01.888
please and thank you and we'll be okay?

14:01.966 --> 14:05.511
Of course. Oh! I know a
great game that can help!

14:06.262 --> 14:09.723
Okay, this game is
called Monster, May I?

you or you don't move forward.

explained the rules yet.

Oh, right... Sorry.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.953
The way to get to the finish
line is to take turns asking,

14:31.036 --> 14:33.122
"Monster, may I please?"

14:33.205 --> 14:35.224
I'll be the monster and you have to ask

14:35.231 --> 14:37.507
me for permission to move each turn.

Oh, I get it.

if you don't say please before you
start and thank you when you finish,

14:59.148 --> 15:02.067
then you have to go all
the way back and start over.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.945

to help everyone remember
to say please and thank you.

at the table has been served

- before we start to eat!
- Mmm-hmm.
