00:40.866 --> 00:42.825
Hey.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.783
Good morning.

00:44.827 --> 00:48.048
Is that matzah brei

00:48.091 --> 00:49.832
Thanks, roomie.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.052
I hope I got it right.Well...

00:52.095 --> 00:54.619
Wait, this is actually perfect.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.405
Yes.Usually, matzah
brei is either

00:57.448 --> 00:59.102
too crunchy or hella soggy.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.104
But you nailed

01:01.148 --> 01:03.454
the perfect
lumpy, gooey texture.

01:03.498 --> 01:06.805
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.111
Ooh, wow. What are you doing?

01:08.155 --> 01:10.722
I've been training.
Prepping and repping.

01:10.766 --> 01:14.161
My ten-year high school reunion
is coming up, and I'm stoked.

01:14.204 --> 01:17.120
I may not have mentioned,
but I was prom king.

01:17.164 --> 01:20.863
Yeah, no, I think it's, uh,
come up once or twice.

01:20.906 --> 01:23.648
Wait, ten years? Didn't you
graduate 12 years ago?

01:23.692 --> 01:25.128
Yeah, okay. What happened was

01:25.172 --> 01:26.695
the class president
is supposed to plan it,

01:26.738 --> 01:29.089
and our class president
is Hector.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.568
Oh, say no more.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.266
No, follow-through
is not Hector's area.

01:32.309 --> 01:36.139
Anyway, Hector ispresident,
but I'm king.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.099
I'm good at it, too.

01:39.142 --> 01:42.058
During my rule as prom king,
I ruled.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.147
I believe that.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.367
Ugh, Josh, this is
so good. Mmm.

01:46.410 --> 01:50.284
Uh-oh. Dairy's tough on me, but
you know what? This is worth it.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.155
Oh, I got you covered.
Um, the Poo-Pourri

01:52.199 --> 01:54.157
and the Arts & Leisure section
of The New York Times

01:54.201 --> 01:55.680
are waiting for you
in the bathroom for later.

01:55.724 --> 01:58.944
That is so sweet.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.903
Thank you, and hey,

02:00.946 --> 02:03.427
I'm sorry I stunk up
the toity yesterday.

02:03.471 --> 02:04.907
Oh, no problem.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.736
Made my eyes tear up,
but, uh, I needed a good cry.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.087
Oh, man, you're the best.

02:16.048 --> 02:18.616
Stop it.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.228
AJ,

02:21.271 --> 02:24.056
have you ever felt smitten
by a man doing workouts,

02:24.100 --> 02:27.625
making you Jewish breakfast eggs
and being okay with your poop?

02:27.669 --> 02:29.888
Yes, of course.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.108
NATHANIEL:
Hey, Leonard.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.588
So how'd she do?
Kylee had a big game

02:33.631 --> 02:35.590
this weekend, right?LEONARD:
Scored three goals

02:35.633 --> 02:37.244
and they're in
the county finals.

02:37.287 --> 02:38.854
NATHANIEL: Oh, well,
I'm not missing that.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.421
I'll bring the orange slices.All right.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.205
Oh, hi.

02:42.249 --> 02:45.252
Hi. Are you bringing
orange slices

02:45.295 --> 02:47.297
to that guy's daughter's
soccer game?

02:47.341 --> 02:50.605
The guy who I only
heretofore knew as "that guy"?

02:50.648 --> 02:52.607
Nancy always brings
the wedges room temp.

02:52.650 --> 02:55.479
Everyone knows you got to
slice them and ice them.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.220
Plus, Leonard works
super hard back there.

02:57.264 --> 03:01.355
Wow. You're being so, uh...

03:01.398 --> 03:03.357
I think the word
is "thoughtful."

03:03.400 --> 03:05.359
Dare I say generous.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.231
It's good to see you, Rebecca.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.326
Ooh-ooh!

03:16.370 --> 03:17.936
You like Nathaniel.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.329
No, I don't.

03:19.373 --> 03:22.027
Shut up. God.

03:22.071 --> 03:25.205
Nathaniel is over. Josh is over.
I'm on my own now.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.902
Mm.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.348
PAULA:
So,

03:38.392 --> 03:40.611
in Nix v. Hedden,
the Supreme Court ruled

03:40.655 --> 03:43.048
tomatoes are a vegetable.

03:43.092 --> 03:46.443
Can you believe it,
Kamala Hare

03:46.487 --> 03:48.837
God, you're the perfect
replacement for Brendan.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.449
A great listener,
and you didn't ruin my vagina.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.291
Ah! You're here. How
long are you here for?

04:08.335 --> 04:09.684
For the rest of the series...

04:10.685 --> 04:12.295
...of holidays, I mean.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.123
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

04:15.820 --> 04:19.084
These decorations are great.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.521
Oh, hey, is that the guest list?

04:20.564 --> 04:22.305
Uh-huh.
Ooh.

04:22.349 --> 04:25.917
Sushi bar. Huh.
Is this the guest list?

04:25.961 --> 04:28.311
And I-I love
these streamers.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.531
So... that's
the guest list, then?

04:30.574 --> 04:32.272
Babe, do you want
to look at the guest list?

04:32.315 --> 04:33.969
I'll check it out.Uh-huh.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.803
What's wrong

04:41.846 --> 04:44.284
What face? There's no face.

04:44.327 --> 04:47.156
There's def a face. Huh.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.291
Great job, Mr. Class President.

04:51.334 --> 04:52.466
This is everything I hoped
my ten-year reunion

04:52.509 --> 04:53.902
would be 12 years later.

04:53.945 --> 04:56.296
Thanks. And now that
this reunion is happening,

04:56.339 --> 04:59.516
I finally delivered on all
the campaign promises I made.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.171
Flip-Flop Fridays,
T-shirt Tuesdays.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.304
Never did get us those
two-hour lunches.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.870
I was 17.
Yeah.

05:05.914 --> 05:08.395
I had no idea that
the school board would bury me

05:08.438 --> 05:10.919
in bureaucracy.Okay, okay.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.967
Okay, you're drinking
like you're on

05:16.011 --> 05:17.360
a Civil War operating table.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.362
Seriously, what's up?

05:19.406 --> 05:21.146
Nothing.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.366
Oh, please.
Okay, based on your face

05:23.410 --> 05:24.802
when you were looking
at the guest list,

05:24.846 --> 05:26.717
my guesses are we're dealing
with a frenemy,

05:26.761 --> 05:28.328
a nemesis or an ex.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.027
So it's an ex. Wait, no.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.420
But you dated Josh
all through high school.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.117
So...

05:35.160 --> 05:37.162
you cheated.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.381
Oh, you really cared
about this person.

05:38.425 --> 05:41.471
Oh, my God, you were in love.

05:42.646 --> 05:45.170
:
And nobody knows.

05:45.214 --> 05:48.609
Whoa. This is so juicy.
Wait, wait, was it a girl?

05:50.393 --> 05:51.699
Oh, it was the first girl.

05:51.742 --> 05:54.441
Wait, is she here yet?
Have you seen her?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.530
Oh, okay. So she's not here yet,
but she's on the list.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.533
Okay, I am on it,
I am gonna figure this all out.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.361
You are the worst.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.624
And this is the best.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.060
JOSH:
Hey!

06:05.103 --> 06:06.496
What up, guys?

06:06.540 --> 06:10.587
Hey, Brandon, Kyle,
Jessica, Caitlin,

06:10.631 --> 06:13.155
Marisa, Carlos, Zack,

06:13.198 --> 06:16.506
oh, Parker, Roberto,
Archer, Tran,

06:16.550 --> 06:19.814
oh, Danny, Lindsey, Kristin,

06:19.857 --> 06:21.816
Nestor, Amy, Kelsey,

06:21.859 --> 06:24.035
oh, Jax, Marcus.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.864
You all look amazing.
You're all killing it.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.649
Handstand!

06:30.433 --> 06:31.826
Yes!

06:34.568 --> 06:35.960
Handstand on the entry. Sweet.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.441
We'll be at the full
floor routine within the hour.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.008
Hey, guys.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.401
Don't know if you saw
my handstand...

06:41.444 --> 06:42.750
Yeah....but the king is here.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.406
Ah.Um, should I make

06:46.449 --> 06:48.712
my welcome speech now or wait
for more people to show up?

06:48.756 --> 06:50.453
Or should I do it twice?

06:50.497 --> 06:52.194
You're not making the speech.
I'm making the speech.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.543
I'm class president.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.240
And Father Brah
is vice president,

06:55.284 --> 06:58.418
so in the unlikely event that
I'm unable to perform my duties,

06:58.461 --> 06:59.767
he's giving the speech.That's a good point.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.508
JOSH:
Mm,

07:01.551 --> 07:04.554
don't you think people want
to hear from me more than you?

07:04.598 --> 07:06.861
The whole class votes
for prom king

07:06.904 --> 07:08.906
because everyone goes to prom,
but barely anyone votes

07:08.950 --> 07:11.082
for president because
the elections were during lunch,

07:11.126 --> 07:12.867
which was only 40 minutes long.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.129
Oh...If you make lunch longer,

07:14.172 --> 07:15.957
you're giving cafeteria
workers a raise.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.263
That's not in the budget.

07:18.307 --> 07:21.615
You're gonna have
to let that go. Okay, bud?

07:25.575 --> 07:27.490
Ha ha! She's here.

07:27.534 --> 07:30.362
God, stop.
Why

07:30.406 --> 07:32.800
Because you have some
reunion intrigue happening,

07:32.843 --> 07:34.497
and I am here for it.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.456
I'm an old married lady.

07:36.499 --> 07:39.415
The romantic intrigue part
of my life is over forever.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.504
You've been married
for five minutes.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.637
I know, and I'm so happy,
but there's no drama,

07:43.680 --> 07:45.682
and I love drama.

07:45.726 --> 07:48.468
REBECCA: Everyone, hi.
I made these pretzels

07:48.511 --> 07:50.818
for your reunion. School colors,
worked really hard on them.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.515
Oh, hey, guys.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.561
Listen, I need
to talk to somebody,

07:54.604 --> 07:55.779
and Paula's MIA
for some reason--

07:55.823 --> 07:57.215
not that you guys
are my second choice.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.174
Welcome back to town,
by the way.VALENCIA: Great.

07:59.217 --> 08:00.610
Yeah, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.264
Ugh! Disaster.
I'm having feelings

08:02.307 --> 08:04.527
for both Nathaniel and Josh.

08:04.571 --> 08:08.749
What happened
Kissing

08:08.792 --> 08:11.534
No, nothing like that, I'm just,
I'm having those romantic trills

08:11.578 --> 08:14.102
in my head and then
I shake them off like this.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.886
Anyway, am I-- I can't
believe I'm saying this--

08:15.930 --> 08:20.804
am I meant to be with Nathaniel
or Josh or both or neither?

08:20.848 --> 08:22.806
Neither.
Neither.Right, of course.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.982
Because the idea
of "meant to be" is a lie

08:25.026 --> 08:26.636
perpetuated by Western culture.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.246
No.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.509
You're meant to be with Greg.

08:29.552 --> 08:30.684
Wait, you think that?

08:30.727 --> 08:31.859
I totally think that.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.861
Everyone thinks that. Duh.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.388
Sorry, did you...
did you say Greg?

08:39.431 --> 08:41.695
Greg from two years ago?

08:41.738 --> 08:43.305
Who we all haven't seen and
literally never talk about?

08:43.348 --> 08:44.524
That Greg?

08:44.567 --> 08:46.569
You guys,
that's insane.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.790
Lest you forget,
I slept with his dad.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.618
Guys, I'm not
in touch with Greg.

08:51.661 --> 08:54.925
Our relationship was
terrible and toxic,

08:54.969 --> 08:56.884
we didn't get along,
we fought all the time.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.712
I don't even think
he thought I was pretty.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.409
I mean, he was mean to me
most of the time

09:00.452 --> 09:02.324
and hated himself
for caring about me,

09:02.367 --> 09:04.892
and also, Greg has a serious
girlfriend now, and I know that

09:04.935 --> 09:07.155
because again,
I slept with his dad.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.636
Right.But you're still on
the Greg train. Okay, look,

09:09.679 --> 09:12.726
the only way-- the only way--
the only way

09:12.769 --> 09:16.991
Greg would ever be
my "meant to be" is if we were

09:17.034 --> 09:20.603
in some sort of sci-fi weird
parallel alternate universe

09:20.647 --> 09:23.040
where he was just
a completely different person.

09:23.084 --> 09:26.000
GREG: There you guys are.WHITE JOSH: Buddy.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.176
Hey, buddy.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.612
HEATHER:
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

09:29.656 --> 09:30.657
Greg is here?

09:32.310 --> 09:34.182
Wait, where is Greg?
I don't see him.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.053
What?

09:36.097 --> 09:38.621
He's right there.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.582
That's not Greg, that's
a completely different person.

09:42.625 --> 09:46.629
Wh...Right?

09:46.673 --> 09:47.978
Right?

09:53.070 --> 09:55.029
Serrano. You made it.
I can't believe you're here.

09:55.072 --> 09:58.554
Yeah, you flew all the way
back from Atlanta for this?

09:58.598 --> 09:59.860
What happened, did you get
kicked out of business school?

10:00.425 --> 10:01.775
GREG: No, I'm-I'm here
on winter break.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.690
I'm actually back for
the whole rest of the series...

10:03.733 --> 10:05.735
of holidays.

10:05.779 --> 10:09.173
Thanksgiving, Christmas,
New Year's and the finale.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.827
Valentine's Day.

10:10.871 --> 10:14.309
Valentine's Day. I guess that is
the logical end of our series...

10:14.352 --> 10:15.702
of holidays.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.268
REBECCA:
Guys, that's not Greg.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.707
Except for the part
where it's Greg.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.841
He doesn't seem totally
different to you guys?

10:24.885 --> 10:27.801
No, but he's
your ex-boyfriend.

10:27.844 --> 10:29.977
You haven't seen him
in a long time.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.719
Of course he seems
different to you.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.418
What?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.987
GREG:
Whoa, Rebecca's here?

10:40.030 --> 10:42.337
At our high school reunion?Yeah, she brought over

10:42.380 --> 10:43.947
pretzels
from her store.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.949
REBECCA: Oh, God, he saw me.
I guess I should go over there.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.822
Whoo, boy,
this is gonna be awkward.

10:48.865 --> 10:52.564
Whoo, boy, this is
gonna be awkward.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.791
Hi...Hi...

11:01.835 --> 11:04.925
BOTH:
Hello... there.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.232
WHITE JOSH:
Hector, maybe we should

11:08.276 --> 11:11.496
go check out the sushi bar
because it is so... over there.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.892
So, uh, how
How've you been?

11:15.936 --> 11:18.242
: God, I don't even
know how to answer that.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.854
Right.It's a long story.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.944
Hey, don't take this
the wrong way, but...

11:23.987 --> 11:25.859
Good sentence opener,
always leads to something great.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.730
That's funny. You are Greg.
You're funny. Um...

11:27.774 --> 11:30.080
But you seem really different.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.821
Like, really
different, like...

11:31.865 --> 11:34.606
Well...
Just, like,
really, um...

11:34.650 --> 11:36.739
Like, really, like, different?

11:36.783 --> 11:38.741
Yeah! Yeah, man, yeah.Yeah.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.874
Well, I don't know,
a lot of time has passed

11:40.917 --> 11:42.963
since we've last
seen each other.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.965
I also have a long story.

11:45.008 --> 11:48.925
Okay. Okay. That must be it.Yeah.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.710
You know, we should
catch up sometime.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.060
Okay, uh, well, I-I'm here
through the holidays.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.539
So through Valentine's Day?

11:54.583 --> 11:56.585
Yes, through Valentine's Day.Okay.

11:56.628 --> 11:59.631
Well, good, let's catch up and
I can figure out why you're...

11:59.675 --> 12:00.763
so different,

12:00.807 --> 12:02.678
and you're good
to catch up with me

12:02.722 --> 12:05.855
in, like, a casual no drama,

12:05.899 --> 12:07.857
no yelling at each other
type way?

12:07.901 --> 12:09.772
Yeah, we can just figure
each other out again.

12:09.816 --> 12:10.860
:
Oh, great.

12:10.904 --> 12:14.081
Yeah. Great, yeah.Okay... Greg. Great.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.866
I-I don't want to keep you. This
is your reunion, so reunite.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.825
Yeah, okay.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.263
Wow.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.093
Okay, so that's Greg.
I see it now.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.921
He says he's down
to catch up with me

12:27.964 --> 12:29.966
in a casual, no drama type way,

12:30.010 --> 12:32.490
which means I don't think
he knows about Marco,

12:32.534 --> 12:34.754
which means I got
to tell him, right?

12:34.797 --> 12:37.191
And he's gonna hate me,
but it's the right thing to do.

12:37.234 --> 12:40.063
That is gonna be tough.Mm-hmm.
I know.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.848
Well, at least I have time

12:41.891 --> 12:45.068
to choose my words carefully,
figure out what I'm gonna say.

12:45.112 --> 12:47.462
High school reunion.
Let's do this.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.072
JOSH:
Hey, guys!

12:49.116 --> 12:51.727
Time for the king's speech.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.947
Not the movie, but, uh,
maybe I'll win an Oscar.

12:54.948 --> 12:57.211
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

12:57.254 --> 13:00.867
Hey, so, uh, turns out
I hate reunions.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.303
You just want
to catch up now?

13:02.346 --> 13:03.870
Now?
Uh-huh.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.306
JOSH: Okay,
p-p-p-panthers,

13:05.349 --> 13:07.874
let's p-p-p-party!

13:07.917 --> 13:10.006
Yeah, let's go now.
Now's good.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.312
JOSH:
King's Speech?

13:11.355 --> 13:13.140
No one's seen it?
Okay.

13:13.183 --> 13:16.926
No one, no one saw it?
Oh, it's really good!

13:16.970 --> 13:19.929
Okay, there is this
king, he stutters,

13:19.973 --> 13:22.932
but he's got to give
this speech.

13:22.976 --> 13:26.022
So there's this other older guy,
he helps him out,

13:26.066 --> 13:28.546
he's also British-- by the way,
the king is British--

13:28.590 --> 13:30.113
so he's like, :
"Uh, I can't,

13:30.157 --> 13:31.332
I can't speak."

13:31.375 --> 13:32.855
:
And the older guy's like,

13:32.899 --> 13:34.161
:
"No, you could do it."

13:34.204 --> 13:36.380
So he gives the speech,

13:36.424 --> 13:39.427
and it k

13:41.255 --> 13:42.822
WHITE JOSH:
Oh, I get it now.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.867
The stutter thing works
when you have the context

13:44.911 --> 13:46.651
of the entire plot
of the movie.

13:46.695 --> 13:49.785
Whoa. Might want to
slow down there, bud.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.876
I need to drink. I'm so annoyed.
Josh is so annoying.

13:53.920 --> 13:58.446
I'm president. I was supposed
to make the speech.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.187
Okay.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.405
Is it this one?

14:02.406 --> 14:04.887
How about this one?Stop it.

14:04.931 --> 14:08.108
This one Hmm...

14:08.151 --> 14:11.894
How about this one
Is it her right here? She fine.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.941
Josh, could you do me a favor

14:14.984 --> 14:16.899
and, uh, chill out
with all the "king" crap?

14:16.943 --> 14:18.945
What? Everyone loves it.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.772
Everyone's having a good time.

14:20.816 --> 14:23.079
I mean, we've been waiting
for this moment for 12 years,

14:23.123 --> 14:26.822
but I didn't want to say
anything, it should've been ten.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.171
You don't want to say anything

14:28.215 --> 14:29.477
You just said it!Okay, okay.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.131
Let's take it down,
everybody.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.307
Uh, Hector,
you're really doing this?

14:33.350 --> 14:35.048
You coming for the king?

14:35.091 --> 14:37.093
Oh, boy, here we go.Don't push me, Chan.

14:37.137 --> 14:40.488
That's King Chan to you.

14:40.531 --> 14:43.143
Whoa, oh.Oh, my God,
you're not the prom king!

14:43.186 --> 14:44.144
And there it is.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.755
What?

14:46.798 --> 14:49.497
Yeah, I am. I-I won.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.933
No, you're not.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.935
The president counts
the votes for prom king.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.371
White Josh won,

14:54.415 --> 14:55.938
but he didn't want it

14:55.982 --> 14:57.070
'cause he thought
it was corny,

14:57.113 --> 15:00.987
so we gave it
to the runner-up, you.

15:01.030 --> 15:05.426
WiJo, is this true?

15:05.469 --> 15:07.950
Uh...

15:07.994 --> 15:09.996
I knew you would
really enjoy it.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.475
And, uh,

15:11.519 --> 15:15.175
you do such
a good j-j-j-job.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.142
Yeah, so, uh,

15:26.186 --> 15:30.320
this is my, uh, salty castle.

15:30.364 --> 15:33.671
Rebetzel's.

15:33.715 --> 15:37.980
Clever. You really twisted
those two words together, huh?

15:38.024 --> 15:40.243
That's funny.
Um, will you excuse me?

15:40.287 --> 15:41.723
I just-- I'll be back. Just...

15:41.766 --> 15:44.160
Yeah, sure.Yup.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.814
Paula, Greg's here.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.310
In conclusion, ma'am...

16:03.353 --> 16:05.225
Sorry, sorry,

16:05.268 --> 16:06.617
Your Honor.

16:06.661 --> 16:09.620
I believe the facts
stand for themselves.

16:09.664 --> 16:12.145
GREG: So you have
to work at night?

16:12.188 --> 16:15.757
Wow, the pretzel game
is intense.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.499
Yeah. We proof the dough,
pre-braid the pretzels,

16:18.542 --> 16:20.414
and prepare the toppings
for the next day.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.330
And you're really not a lawyer
anymore, that is...

16:23.373 --> 16:25.549
not surprising.
You never did seem to like it

16:25.593 --> 16:28.465
and didn't ever do any work
that I recall.

16:28.509 --> 16:31.077
That's true, that's true.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.341
So, um, this must
be weird for you,

16:34.384 --> 16:36.038
being back
in town after,

16:36.082 --> 16:38.606
what, two years?Actually, I got to confess,

16:38.649 --> 16:40.869
I've been back a few times.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.697
You have?

16:42.740 --> 16:44.612
Yeah, uh, I just thought
it would be best

16:44.655 --> 16:46.135
if you and I
didn't see each other.

16:46.179 --> 16:50.922
So you were back in town
and no one told me?

16:50.966 --> 16:53.099
Well, I may have
asked them not to.

16:53.142 --> 16:55.101
I did. Yeah, I did.

16:55.144 --> 16:58.147
Look, I know that things ended
pretty badly between us,

16:58.191 --> 17:01.020
but I didn't realize that you
felt the need to hide from me.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.891
Well, I wasn't hiding, per se,

17:02.934 --> 17:04.893
although,
now that I describe it,

17:04.936 --> 17:06.938
it bears many
of the hallmarks of hiding.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.418
Look,

17:08.462 --> 17:11.508
you and I had crappy stuff
happen between us, a lot.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.597
Yeah.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.252
But when I saw you
just now, I realized,

17:16.296 --> 17:21.301
we were close, you know,
we used to like each other.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.998
We were friends.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.175
Yeah. We were.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.395
And I would love to
have that again with you.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.092
But...

17:30.136 --> 17:33.008
I'm doing this thing where
I'm taking responsibility

17:33.052 --> 17:35.097
for everything in my life,
tying up loose ends,

17:35.141 --> 17:39.406
making things okay with people
I used to have issues with.

17:39.449 --> 17:43.236
And again, I-I really would love
to be friends with you again

17:43.279 --> 17:45.934
so much, but there's
something I got to tell you.

17:45.977 --> 17:49.198
You know what?
Let's not do that.

17:49.242 --> 17:52.332
Let's not tell each other
difficult things.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.724
So much time has gone by.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.335
You said I seem
totally different to you.

17:55.378 --> 17:58.773
You do. I'm still reeling
from it, actually.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.515
So let's move forward.
Fresh start.

18:03.256 --> 18:06.259
Like, pretend we're meeting
for the first time?

18:06.302 --> 18:07.477
Exactly.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.436
You sure?
Yeah.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.220
So clean slate?

18:11.264 --> 18:14.223
Yeah, that's exactly
what I want.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.225

21:25.675 --> 21:27.416
Okay, I'll tell you
what happened.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.114
Because I brilliantly
wore you down?

21:30.158 --> 21:31.594
No, because
I'm drunk and sad

21:31.638 --> 21:33.117
and I want you to stop
pointing at women.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.336
That's fair.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.946
Okay, hit me.
I'm ready.

21:35.990 --> 21:39.428
Hey, Bart, do we have popcorn
or just these pretzels?

21:39.472 --> 21:41.909
Perf. Okay, go.

21:41.952 --> 21:44.781
Senior year, I started hating
Josh because, you know, Josh.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.044
Then, I was in
chemistry class

21:47.088 --> 21:49.133
and got this super
hot lab partner.

21:49.177 --> 21:50.352
Before you know it,

21:50.396 --> 21:52.441
we were full on
sneaking around

21:52.485 --> 21:54.356
and making out, hooking up
all over the school.

21:54.400 --> 21:58.404
Oh, my God,
you guys had chemistry.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.144
Sorry, sorry, go on.

22:00.188 --> 22:04.192
Eventually, Lab Partner
says, "I love you."

22:04.235 --> 22:07.326
"You need to choose.
Josh or me."

22:07.369 --> 22:10.111
Is anything hotter
than an ultimatum?
No.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.504
So, what'd you do?

22:11.547 --> 22:13.375
On the last day of school
I wrote a letter saying,

22:13.419 --> 22:15.508
"I choose you."

22:15.551 --> 22:17.161
"Meet me under the bleachers

22:17.205 --> 22:19.425
so we can figure out
the rest of our lives."

22:19.468 --> 22:21.688
Oh, my God,
that's so intense.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.994
I just got that tattooed
on my ankle.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.170
Bart, bring me a sherry.

22:27.868 --> 22:30.958
Yes, Bart. Mmm.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.525
Ew, that is gross.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.091
That is so gross.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.397
Never ordering that again.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.920
So then what happened?

22:36.964 --> 22:38.922
I went to the lockers,
tucked the letter in the pocket

22:38.966 --> 22:41.577
of their varsity jacket, and
waited under the bleachers.

22:41.621 --> 22:42.970
And And?

22:43.013 --> 22:44.406
And nothing.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.973
They never showed up,
we never spoke.

22:46.016 --> 22:47.714
High school ended, we
went our separate ways.

22:47.757 --> 22:48.932
To this day,

22:48.976 --> 22:51.108
we try to avoid each other.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.720
Never more than a hello.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.810
And this was the
person I loved.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.028
Oh, my God.

22:58.072 --> 22:59.290
Wh

22:59.334 --> 23:00.422
Why didn't she show up?

23:00.466 --> 23:02.424
I don't know.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.513
I've never known.

23:04.557 --> 23:05.862
Well, what are you
waiting for?

23:05.906 --> 23:07.516
I mean, you have to talk
to her right this second.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.344
Give that to me,
I need it right now.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.085
No.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.653
What's the point?

23:13.696 --> 23:15.306
What's the point
of anything anymore?

23:21.530 --> 23:23.140
Oh, hey, um,

23:23.184 --> 23:25.055
you're that guy
from Rebecca's office, right?

23:25.099 --> 23:26.883
Yep, it's George.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.885
Also, we went to
high school together.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.322
We did?

23:31.366 --> 23:32.715
And are these your relatives?

23:32.759 --> 23:35.326
Are these my... relatives?

23:35.370 --> 23:36.980
What kind of gene pool we...?
No.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.721
This is the school magic club.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.854
The magic club?
We didn't have a magic club.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.159
But we did.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.553
Meet the Abro-cadabras.

23:44.597 --> 23:48.601
And one Abro-cadabwoman.

23:48.644 --> 23:49.950
I mean, I love magic.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.517
I-I did little tricks here
and there in high school

23:51.560 --> 23:54.433
for my friends, but they
gave me so much crap for it.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.435
I had no idea
there was a club.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.001
Can I hang with you guys?

23:58.045 --> 23:59.481
Uh, I object.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.092
We've all seen your
handstands; you're popular.

24:02.136 --> 24:03.616
Let us have our thing.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.618
W-W-Wait.
Hang on a second, guys.

24:05.661 --> 24:08.229
I know him; he's not a bad dude.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.666
Can we please break
the abracadabrules

24:10.710 --> 24:12.886
just this one time?

24:12.929 --> 24:15.323
Okay.
Sure.

24:15.366 --> 24:16.542
Okay. You're in.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.065
So,

24:18.108 --> 24:20.241
this is Alden, The Great Aldini.

24:20.284 --> 24:23.462
This is Lily,
Assistant to No One,

24:23.505 --> 24:25.289
and this is Magic Mike.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.683
I had the name
before the movie.

24:27.727 --> 24:31.861
And I am, of course...

24:31.905 --> 24:34.211
Raven.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.083
Can I have a magic name?

24:36.126 --> 24:38.259
Why don't we see how this goes
first, okay?

24:38.302 --> 24:39.913
Okay.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.668
Everything okay?

24:55.711 --> 24:56.843
Perfect.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.758
Hey, so, I know we said
no recrimination,

24:58.801 --> 25:00.150
but there's one thing
from our past

25:00.194 --> 25:02.762
that I've been
really angry about.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.807
There has been

25:04.851 --> 25:06.679
Yeah. You once said
that your favorite president

25:06.722 --> 25:08.463
was Rutherford B. Hayes.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.030
That has to be explained.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.771
Right. Oh. What?

25:11.814 --> 25:13.686
So you like Lincoln
or Washington,

25:13.729 --> 25:14.948
one of the obviosos?

25:14.991 --> 25:18.038
No. Best president
was James K. Polk.

25:18.081 --> 25:20.257
The only president who said
he needed four years

25:20.301 --> 25:22.433
to complete his goals,
did that,

25:22.477 --> 25:24.740
and then didn't run
for reelection.

25:24.784 --> 25:27.438
Huh. Okay.
What were his goals?

25:27.482 --> 25:30.224
No idea.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.660
Hopefully not racist.

25:31.704 --> 25:32.922
I don't think racist.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.708
Look, the point is
that the man had a goal

25:35.751 --> 25:37.231
and a super cool name.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.667
Polk.

25:38.711 --> 25:39.799
Is it "Poke" or "Polk"?

25:39.842 --> 25:41.844
It's-- well, it's kind
of like "yolk."

25:41.888 --> 25:44.281
Figured, as a pretzel shop
owner, you'd know that.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.589
Wow, we are really killing
this friend thing.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.373
Totally.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.898
But, sadly,
I actually have to run.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.073
Oh.

25:53.116 --> 25:54.422
I got to go see my dad.

25:54.465 --> 25:57.077
Oh, your dad.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.252
Yeah, my dad.

25:58.295 --> 26:00.733
Marco. Wait.
Do you know him?

26:00.776 --> 26:01.777
I can't remember.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.649
Nah, I-I-- well,
I can't recall.

26:03.692 --> 26:04.693
No, you would
definitely remember.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.739
The guy is a total character.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.089
Uh, he-he was also
a really bad father,

26:09.132 --> 26:10.569
honestly, but, uh,

26:10.612 --> 26:12.048
no, he's getting
his act together.

26:12.092 --> 26:15.138
You think I've changed,
the guy's a whole new ball game.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.271
He's sober now,
just going to meetings.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.751
Just like me.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.448
Whoa.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.406
Apparently we have more
in common than I thought.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.932
That's-- more in common than
you thought, that's funny.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.411
It is?

26:27.455 --> 26:28.717
Ah, it's not.
No, it's not.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.153
Go on.

26:30.197 --> 26:32.112
Yeah, so now he's in
this phase of recovery

26:32.155 --> 26:33.809
where he wants
to unburden himself

26:33.853 --> 26:35.158
from all the bad stuff he did.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.204
:
Oh...

26:37.247 --> 26:38.814
Is that also funny?

26:38.858 --> 26:40.555
No, I'm sorry.
It's, um...

26:40.599 --> 26:42.992
a thing I've learned in therapy,
laugh through the emotions.

26:43.036 --> 26:44.864
So I'm moved.
I'm moved by it.
Oh.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.692
It's like,
"Ha, ha, ha, ah."

26:46.735 --> 26:48.650
Well, anyway,
he said we need

26:48.694 --> 26:50.870
to have some kind
of brutal conversation tonight

26:50.913 --> 26:53.524
where he, I don't know,
tells me he murdered some people

26:53.568 --> 26:55.657
and buried them in
our old yard or something.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.659
Oh, I'm sure it's not that.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.008
How I wish it were that.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.097
Yeah, well, whatever it is,
it's gonna suck

27:01.141 --> 27:02.969
because neither of us
will be drunk for it.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.885
That's funny.

27:05.928 --> 27:09.410
Anyway, um, we should
catch up more later.

27:09.453 --> 27:10.803
Yeah.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.631
After you see your dad.

27:12.674 --> 27:13.806
Yeah.
All right.

27:13.849 --> 27:14.850
Bye, Rebetzel.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.373
Bye.
Bye.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.943
No. Ugh. Butterfingers.

27:22.249 --> 27:23.816
Can you help me?

27:29.517 --> 27:31.084
♪

28:01.288 --> 28:02.898
Huh?

28:02.942 --> 28:04.813
Check it out.

28:04.857 --> 28:07.250
Oh, wow.
Look at those

28:07.294 --> 28:11.428
pretzel-adjacent things
that will be sold tomorrow

28:11.472 --> 28:12.952
for a large discount.

28:12.995 --> 28:15.215
Yeah. You know, my girlfriend,
well, my ex, actually,

28:15.258 --> 28:17.434
she loves to buy
discount pastries.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.915
I've actually eaten my share
of stale doughnuts myself.

28:19.959 --> 28:21.308
Sorry, you said
your girlfriend

28:21.351 --> 28:23.179
or your e-- your ex,
you were saying...?

28:23.223 --> 28:24.877
Oh, yeah. I was dating
this girl in Atlanta.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.922
She was great.
Very, very cool person,

28:26.966 --> 28:28.924
but eventually
I just realized that,

28:28.968 --> 28:31.405
you know, I didn't feel
the way I should.
Oh.

28:31.448 --> 28:35.278
The way I, um,
have in the past.

28:37.498 --> 28:38.760
Oh. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Yeah.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.763
I mean, that makes sense.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.765
Hey, have you ever considered
the pretzel stick?

28:43.809 --> 28:45.419
So much easier.

28:45.462 --> 28:46.942
I mean, check this out.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.683
It's done.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.555
That's pretty...
that's pretty great.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.649
Is... this your card?

29:00.869 --> 29:02.828
This one

29:02.871 --> 29:04.046
This one?
The red one.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.700
This one.That one. That one right there.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.310
Yeah, I did it.

29:07.354 --> 29:09.356
Oh. I'm a natural.

29:09.399 --> 29:12.054
Why am I dwelling
on this person?

29:12.098 --> 29:15.536
I don't know,
but it's so romantic.
Mm.

29:15.579 --> 29:18.321
Okay, everybody,
I was gonna give a speech,

29:18.365 --> 29:21.542
but someone did that.

29:21.585 --> 29:25.764
But I do have something else
that's kind of fun for you guys.

29:25.807 --> 29:26.895
Two

29:28.114 --> 29:30.464
There are unions
and they have rules.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.813
I can send you links.

29:31.857 --> 29:35.599
What I have is kind
of a fun thing.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.863
Uh, when we graduated,
the custodian gave me

29:37.906 --> 29:40.126
the lost and found
from the senior room,

29:40.169 --> 29:43.129
and it's been, well, it's been
sitting in my trunk since then.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.826
GARY:
You've had our stuff

29:44.870 --> 29:46.915
for 12 years?

29:46.959 --> 29:48.221
WHITE JOSH:
All right.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.353
Okay, okay.
Let's take it easy on Hector.

29:50.397 --> 29:54.009
Huh? So what if he's had our
stuff in his trunk for 12 years?

29:54.053 --> 29:55.445
It's kind of fun.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.621
It's like a,
it's like a time capsule.

29:57.665 --> 30:00.624
Huh? It's filled with
sentimental keepsakes.

30:00.668 --> 30:01.930
What you got in there, Hector?

30:01.974 --> 30:03.018
Thank you, WiJo.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.846
Uh, let's see.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.457
Oh, a dusty old retainer.Ooh.
