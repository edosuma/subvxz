WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:05.170
Widow, you sure your tip
was, you know, accurate?

00:05.172 --> 00:07.106
This place is emptier
than hulk's head.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.241
S.H.I.E.L.D. Tip.
It's the first place
we trashed

00:09.243 --> 00:11.076
And the last place
we looked.

00:11.078 --> 00:13.145
Captain america:
Cut the chatter.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.680
This is the first peep
we've heard from the cabal

00:14.682 --> 00:17.783
Since they got their
hands on the tesseract.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.685
Listen to uncle cap, people.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.420
Who knows what weapons
they've super-charged

00:21.422 --> 00:23.088
With its cosmic energy.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.757
Jarvis, broaden
my infra-reds.

00:24.759 --> 00:28.327
Skull's not catching me
with my iron pants down again.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.330
Super-charged weapons?
The tesseract can do that?

00:31.332 --> 00:34.800
Aye. The tesseract is
a source of unlimited power.

00:34.802 --> 00:46.812
Capable of many glorious
and terrible feats.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.814
Speak, troll.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.550
Why have you brought attuma
to this frozen hole?

00:51.552 --> 00:55.387
Certainly not
for your big mouth,
you bloated pufferfish.

00:55.389 --> 01:02.628
Behold!

01:02.630 --> 01:04.430
Hyperion:
Iridium?

01:04.432 --> 01:05.764
Interesting.

01:05.766 --> 01:09.101
More than
interesting, hyperion.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.770
It is the keystone
to our success.

01:11.772 --> 01:15.674
I don't want
to be here with you
any longer than is...

01:15.676 --> 01:18.544
Silence, head.
I hear something.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.679
(clattering)

01:20.681 --> 01:23.749
Blah! Enough of your
paranoid dramatics.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.752
There is nothing out...

01:26.754 --> 01:29.755
Doubt me again,
and I can always
let the next one go.

01:29.757 --> 01:33.125
(beeps)

01:33.127 --> 01:34.526
Iron man:
Avengers, assemble!

01:34.528 --> 01:39.731
Hulk! Thor!
Engage the heavy hitters!

01:39.733 --> 01:49.842
Peek-a-boo,
spaceman.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.844
A sneak attack, stark?

01:51.846 --> 01:53.679
How precious.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.682
Allow me to retort!

01:56.684 --> 01:58.584
Jarvis:
<i>Tesseract energy</i>
<i>detected, sir.</i>

01:58.586 --> 02:01.887
<i>Success ratio has</i>
<i>fallen to 18.2%.</i>

02:01.889 --> 02:04.857
Got it, jarvis. Falcon.
Right flank, strafe low.

02:04.859 --> 02:07.860
Corner them to the hole.

02:07.862 --> 02:10.795
Wait. Hulk needs space!

02:10.798 --> 02:12.431
(modok grunts)

02:12.433 --> 02:15.868
No. What hulk needs
is falcon
to secure his six.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.804
Sam, go.

02:18.806 --> 02:22.841
When hulk and hyperion
go at it, they
shake continents.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.810
It's an unnecessary risk.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.846
Look around, cap.
They got
tesseract weapons.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.615
We're way beyond risk.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.749
Perfect time
to trust our strengths

02:30.751 --> 02:32.751
And not question
our weakness.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.254
This is a turkey shoot!
Sam, do it!

02:35.256 --> 02:38.891
Off of me, filthy beast.

02:38.893 --> 02:42.194
Falcon: Look out!

02:42.196 --> 02:43.862
Falcon!

02:43.864 --> 02:48.734
(chuckles)
one down.
Billions to go.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.636
(falcon screaming)

02:50.638 --> 02:52.237
Sam!

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.783 --> 03:06.385
Sam!

03:06.387 --> 03:07.819
Jarvis, prep the sick bay.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.922
We need a full
diagnostic scan.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.790
(heart beating)

03:11.792 --> 03:14.259
Hang in there, buddy.
We're almost there.

03:14.261 --> 03:18.230
(beeping)

03:18.232 --> 03:20.766
(monitor beeps)

03:20.768 --> 03:23.835
Falcon's stabilized.
The suit took
most of the impact.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.671
He was always getting
his wings pulled off.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.407
I tweaked it to withstand
a 200 foot drop.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.476
Listen up, avengers.
Effective immediately,

03:31.478 --> 03:33.879
I'm stepping down
as the leader of the team.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.948
Do you think this is really
the time for that, tony?

03:35.950 --> 03:37.216
Time for what?

03:37.218 --> 03:38.850
The "woe is me" routine.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.853
I should lead.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.622
What? They'd never
see that coming.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.824
Hawkeye:
Today's already been
full of so many surprises

03:45.826 --> 03:48.393
That my brain literally
cannot comprehend

03:48.395 --> 03:49.695
The words coming
out of your mouth.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.430
Can it comprehend
my fist?

03:51.432 --> 03:53.899
Stop. This is
no time for joking.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.602
I'm not joking, widow.
Think about it.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.670
Every counter strategy
they've done has been

03:58.672 --> 04:01.607
In direct response
to my leadership.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.275
I'm a tech genius.

04:03.277 --> 04:06.912
Cap's a...
Well, a captain.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.780
Why don't we all just
do what we're good at

04:08.782 --> 04:11.283
And call it a day? Hoorah.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.552
Odin's beard.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.921
Couldn't have
said it better.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.024
(alarms blare)

04:19.026 --> 04:20.858
Jarvis,
pull up the monitors.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.861
Jarvis:
<i>I cannot, captain.</i>
<i>I have been hacked.</i>

04:22.863 --> 04:24.663
Jarvis,
no time for protocol.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.865
Cap is now
officially in charge...

04:26.867 --> 04:28.900
Wait, did you say hacked?

04:28.902 --> 04:31.737
<i>Is this thing on?</i>
<i>Stark? You there?</i>

04:31.739 --> 04:33.538
Hammer.
<i>Stark.</i>

04:33.540 --> 04:34.806
What do you want, hammer?

04:34.808 --> 04:36.441
<i>Pictures, not words.</i>

04:36.443 --> 04:38.343
<i>He's stealing everything.</i>

04:38.345 --> 04:41.613
<i>Stop! I thought</i>
<i>we were friends.</i>

04:41.615 --> 04:44.383
And here I thought nothing
could make me smile today.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.785
Modok and hammer aren't
my expertise. Suit up.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.987
No.
Sam's my responsibility.

04:48.989 --> 04:52.924
My place is by his side.
You do what you do best, cap.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.393
Save the day.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.861
I'll be on comms.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.863
Let me know how
I can back your play.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.431
Meanwhile,
I'll try and figure out

04:59.433 --> 05:01.433
The skull's
next move from here.

05:01.435 --> 05:07.773
And why he's stealing
justin hammer's weapons.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.841
Avengers, assemble!

05:09.843 --> 05:11.610
Hammer: Just take
the weapons!

05:11.612 --> 05:13.445
But make sure
you keep the labels.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.814
I'm glad to have
your blessing, hammer.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.383
Don't worry,
my superior intellect

05:18.385 --> 05:20.085
Will enhance
your pathetic attempts

05:20.087 --> 05:24.589
At cutting-edge
weaponry nicely.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.792
Do you think
this is funny?

05:26.794 --> 05:29.928
No, but that is.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.665
Thor! Hulk! Shut the door!
No one gets out
until we get answers.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.735
Aye!

05:36.737 --> 05:38.870
The door is shut, captain.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.907
(hulk growls)

05:41.909 --> 05:46.078
Widow? Disarm.

05:46.080 --> 05:50.449
For guys named a.I.M.,
you're really lousy shots.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.918
Captain america:
Hawkeye! The head.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.853
Hah! You're pathetic
gadget arrows

05:54.855 --> 05:57.456
Have no effect
on me, fool.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.925
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're the
decked-out tech dude.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.928
That's why I threw
a regular arrow into the mix.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.496
Nice job, everyone.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.465
That actually
went smoothly.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.533
Aye.
Feels kinda weird.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.435
Still say
I could've done better.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.070
Where's the skull, modok?

06:12.072 --> 06:14.005
Spill it, now.

06:14.007 --> 06:22.481
Spill it? With pleasure.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.982
Captain, stand back!

06:23.984 --> 06:25.851
That looks like
the tesseract's power sign.

06:25.853 --> 06:26.952
(cackles)

06:26.954 --> 06:29.521
Right you are, asgardian.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.957
Watch what a fraction
of its power can do

06:31.959 --> 06:35.761
For a technopath.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.662
Stop him, you nitwits.
He's mind-melding

06:37.664 --> 06:40.098
With my proto-weapons.

06:40.100 --> 06:51.777
For a second there,
I thought we were better
without stark.

06:51.779 --> 06:55.881
Defensive formations, go!

06:55.883 --> 06:57.549
Widow, we'll run
interference.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.750
You think you can get
those shoulder turrets

06:58.752 --> 06:59.985
To fire on each other?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.920
You're giving me
the giant robot?

07:01.922 --> 07:11.963
It's about time.

07:11.965 --> 07:22.474
It's about time.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.510
(screams)

07:25.512 --> 07:27.612
And that, gentlemen,
is how you take out

07:27.614 --> 07:30.782
The big machine
without breaking a sweat.

07:30.784 --> 07:35.854
You haven't won
anything, avengers.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.489
You don't know it,

07:37.491 --> 07:39.524
But you're already too late.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.593
(laughs)

07:41.595 --> 07:43.161
First, iridium.
Now, enough proto-weapons

07:43.163 --> 07:45.931
To stockpile an army.
This isn't looking good.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.201
You're telling me.
Who's going to
pay for all of this?

07:49.203 --> 07:51.503
(groans)

07:51.505 --> 07:53.805
Iron man:
<i>Modok's powered</i>
<i>by the tesseract, too?</i>

07:53.807 --> 07:55.941
<i>I was wondering when</i>
<i>that was gonna happen.</i>

07:55.943 --> 07:57.509
Captain america:
We've been running scans
for trace signatures

07:57.511 --> 07:58.877
Of the tesseract,
but modok has

07:58.879 --> 08:01.079
Enough juice now
to cover its tracks.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.814
Not sure what
our next move is.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.484
Without you or sam,
we're flying blind.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.786
<i>Thirty miles due west</i>
<i>of winslow, arizona.</i>

08:07.788 --> 08:10.222
How did...
<i>Technopathic static.</i>

08:10.224 --> 08:13.024
<i>Covering one trail can</i>
<i>sometimes make another.</i>

08:13.026 --> 08:14.893
<i>I told you</i>
<i>I'd back your play.</i>

08:14.895 --> 08:19.631
<i>I need to keep</i>
<i>running algorithms on</i>
<i>skull's possible plans.</i>

08:19.633 --> 08:22.901
<i>And sam's still...</i>

08:22.903 --> 08:28.640
<i>Stark out.</i>
Yeah, out.

08:28.642 --> 08:32.143
(grunting)

08:32.145 --> 08:35.179
Come on! Stay up!

08:35.182 --> 08:37.916
Captain america:
Hang on, widow.
We got this.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.085
Hey, winghead.
Don't need
a fancy formula

08:40.087 --> 08:42.921
To figure out skull's plan.

08:42.923 --> 08:51.796
Come down and enjoy
the celebration, avengers!

08:51.798 --> 08:54.199
So hulk, you still
wanna head up this team?

08:54.201 --> 08:55.967
Hah. You think
I'm stupid?

09:10.182 --> 09:12.984
What now,
oh captain, my captain?

09:12.986 --> 09:15.020
New plan. Widow, hawkeye.

09:15.022 --> 09:20.191
Take out skull's
tesseract weapon!

09:20.193 --> 09:22.727
Hulk, thor,
focus on the heavies.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.064
While I try to take on
the army and modok.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.333
And vampires.

09:28.335 --> 09:33.705
Hit stuff?
Why didn't I think of that?

09:33.707 --> 09:43.882
(yells)

09:43.884 --> 09:51.856
(roaring)

09:51.858 --> 09:55.360
Time to end this
glorious rivalry, hulk.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.895
You got it, fish head.

09:56.897 --> 10:02.334
(roaring)

10:02.336 --> 10:05.170
You are outnumbered
and out-matched.

10:05.172 --> 10:09.841
While you are simply out.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.243
Might wanna
look to your left.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.912
Huh?

10:13.914 --> 10:15.981
Welcome.

10:15.983 --> 10:24.022
Having a special
on wooden arrows!

10:24.024 --> 10:27.726
Do not let them near
the device before
it is fully charged.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.861
(modok screaming)

10:29.863 --> 10:31.997
Do that again, skull,

10:31.999 --> 10:36.267
And I'll rip the armor
right off your body.

10:36.269 --> 10:39.404
Whoa!

10:39.406 --> 10:44.843
The cabal hate
each other almost as
much as they hate us.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.911
Skull's fooling himself
if he thinks his crew

10:46.913 --> 10:48.346
Is going to play
rock-paper-scissors

10:48.348 --> 10:50.715
When they start
divvying countries.

10:50.717 --> 10:54.953
No one's divvying up
anything if I can help it.

10:54.955 --> 10:58.223
Huh?

10:58.225 --> 10:59.958
What's up?
<i>The tesseract's live!</i>

10:59.960 --> 11:02.360
<i>It's attached to a</i>
<i>cannon pointed at the sky.</i>

11:02.362 --> 11:04.162
<i>The cabal has</i>
<i>an earth-conquering army.</i>

11:04.164 --> 11:05.997
<i>We need iron man, now.</i>

11:05.999 --> 11:09.167
Did you say
pointed at the sky?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.703
Really?
That was your
take-away?

11:11.705 --> 11:15.774
Iron man: Cap, listen.
The cabal army makes sense,
but why the iridium?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.242
(groaning)

11:17.244 --> 11:19.344
<i>Get down here and</i>
<i>ask skull yourself.</i>

11:19.346 --> 11:21.713
Already got a call in
to fury for s.H.I.E.L.D.
Backup

11:21.715 --> 11:23.181
On potential target cities.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.717
That should buy you
some time while
I figure this out.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.686
<i>Tony? You said</i>
<i>you'd back my play.</i>

11:27.688 --> 11:30.689
<i>My play is "iron man." now!</i>

11:30.691 --> 11:31.890
(sighs)

11:31.892 --> 11:33.358
Sounds like they
need our help.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.895
Sam! How you doing?
Hey, slow down.

11:36.897 --> 11:40.031
Leg's a little stiff.
But lucky for me, I fly.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.701
No, you should
sit this one out.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.836
Our friends need us.

11:44.838 --> 11:49.107
So it's gonna be
like that, huh?

11:49.109 --> 11:55.113
Then you're gonna need
something awesome.

11:55.115 --> 11:59.117
Falcon:
What are you...
Oh, wow.

11:59.119 --> 12:02.153
Cool.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.956
I made some upgrades
while you were out.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.925
They were supposed
to be for later.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.126
Much later.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.061
Well, no time
like the present.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.030
Why aren't you
armoring up?

12:12.032 --> 12:13.898
Skull is up to something.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.900
I need to stay here
and figure it out.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.802
I'm mission control
on this one.

12:17.804 --> 12:20.105
Mission control?
Are you joking?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.973
No time to explain.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.408
I've put their coordinates
into your nav unit.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.010
The upgrades on
your suit should help.

12:26.012 --> 12:29.280
Tell cap, not to wreck
skull's machine until
I've cracked this.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.349
Tony,
what's going on here?

12:31.351 --> 12:32.917
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you're...

12:32.919 --> 12:34.252
You don't know better.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.322
Uh, is this about
me getting hurt?

12:37.324 --> 12:39.324
Sam, I almost
got you killed.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.025
I'm a liability
right now.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.027
I don't think you
want me out there.

12:43.029 --> 12:46.030
Right, this coming from
the guy who told me
to be an avenger?

12:46.032 --> 12:47.832
That was a mistake.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.467
I pushed you.
I shouldn't have...

12:49.469 --> 12:52.303
It was not a mistake.
I am an avenger.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.272
You know what's more?
I would have never
become one

12:54.274 --> 12:55.874
Without your faith in me.

12:55.876 --> 12:59.277
You're the greatest
man I know.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.546
Whatever you're
working through,
you need to do it fast.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.048
Because we need you,
iron man.

13:04.050 --> 13:12.056
Tony stark. All of it.

13:12.058 --> 13:20.365
(groaning)

13:20.367 --> 13:21.966
Hold them, cabal!

13:21.968 --> 13:32.844
The tesseract awakens.

13:32.846 --> 13:36.047
If we've got a move,
move it now!

13:36.049 --> 13:40.585
Hawkeye, you're up.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.421
Hawkeye:
Whoa, whoa.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.491
Let's wrap this up
and put a bow on it.

13:46.493 --> 13:52.564
Get it? Bow?
'cause I'm an archer?

13:52.566 --> 13:55.333
Falcon,
what are you doing?

13:55.335 --> 13:58.203
Sorry, tony said,
"don't destroy
that machine."

13:58.205 --> 14:00.104
Tony? Is he coming?

14:00.106 --> 14:03.575
(laughing)

14:03.577 --> 14:06.077
(machine whirring)

14:06.079 --> 14:16.120
Ah!

14:16.122 --> 14:24.896
Ah!

14:24.898 --> 14:27.966
Portals?
This invasion force
isn't for earth.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.634
I knew they
couldn't share.

14:29.636 --> 14:33.438
So, avengers,
finally you understand.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.506
Why fight over the scraps,

14:35.508 --> 14:38.409
When there are
countless worlds to conquer?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.445
Behold, cabal!

14:40.447 --> 14:43.948
We stand on the edge
of total victory!

14:43.950 --> 14:46.918
All you need to do
is step forward.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.921
Falcon. Did tony say
anything about them
invading other worlds?

14:49.923 --> 14:52.423
Uh, no.
He didn't mention that.

14:52.425 --> 14:57.295
(laughing)

14:57.297 --> 14:59.898
This just got
a whole lot more
complicated.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.671
Look on, cabal!

15:06.673 --> 15:09.407
Each world
ripe for subjugation.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.009
Lord dracula,

15:11.011 --> 15:13.511
For you a realm
of complete darkness,

15:13.513 --> 15:16.014
Where no sun
stands in your way.

15:16.016 --> 15:19.183
A planet comprised
entirely of vast oceans,

15:19.185 --> 15:22.420
Hand-tailored for
an atlantean conqueror.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.022
An advanced civilization

15:24.024 --> 15:27.158
In desperate need
of hyperion's greatness.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.127
And lastly for you, modok,

15:29.129 --> 15:31.095
My most loyal ally,

15:31.097 --> 15:32.931
The gem of the night sky,

15:32.933 --> 15:35.700
The eternal city, asgard!

15:35.702 --> 15:38.536
Let no man weep,
for there are always

15:38.538 --> 15:41.072
More worlds to conquer.

15:41.074 --> 15:51.082
Avengers! Hold the line!

15:51.084 --> 15:52.984
Uh, just spit-ballin' here,

15:52.986 --> 15:55.053
But why can't we just
let these guys go?

15:55.055 --> 15:57.021
'cause we're not cowards.

15:57.023 --> 16:02.660
Oh, right.

16:02.662 --> 16:07.732
(gasps)

16:07.734 --> 16:09.734
I'm not letting you
go anywhere, dracula.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.269
You're this world's problem.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.238
I have a better idea.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.007
Join us!

16:16.009 --> 16:23.715
(screaming)

16:23.717 --> 16:30.021
Hyperion:
It is marvelous.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.990
Ah!

16:31.992 --> 16:35.727
Out of my way, beast.
A world advanced enough

16:35.729 --> 16:39.564
To appreciate
my greatness, awaits.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.032
(grunts)

16:41.034 --> 16:47.005
They'll survive.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.008
The city eternal?
You would dare?

16:50.010 --> 16:58.783
With the tesseract,
we dare much, thunder fool.

16:58.785 --> 17:12.096
(yells)

17:12.098 --> 17:18.136
What? Modok, no!

17:18.137 --> 17:24.375
(screaming)

17:24.377 --> 17:26.511
Why? We can crush them!

17:26.512 --> 17:28.780
What good is power
if we do not use it?

17:28.782 --> 17:31.749
Iron man:
Because that's
not his plan.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.319
Stark?

17:35.321 --> 17:36.821
Sorry for the delay, guys.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.057
Getting dressed was a pain.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.224
What a showboat.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.726
Wow, tony. When I said,
"all of you,"

17:41.728 --> 17:43.494
I meant it metaphorically.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.531
What can I say, sam?
I don't do anything halfway.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.699
I'm surprised, stark.

17:48.701 --> 17:53.671
I did not think
you were going to show.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.673
Iron man:
Yeah, it finally
dawned on me

17:55.675 --> 17:57.275
That's what you
we're counting on.

17:57.277 --> 18:03.081
Red skull: You have
no chance against me.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.584
(iron man laughs)

18:06.586 --> 18:09.454
Iron man: I lost certainty.
I was doubting myself.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.123
Being a man of science,
that's big stuff.

18:12.125 --> 18:18.863
Good thing I had friends
who still had faith in me.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.631
(chuckles) faith?

18:20.633 --> 18:23.367
You are in worse shape
than I first imagined.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.470
Iron man:
You're not really a
guy who puts much stock

18:25.472 --> 18:27.839
In friends,
are you, skull?

18:27.841 --> 18:35.113
Oh!

18:35.115 --> 18:36.814
Look around, fool.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.883
My friends are
about to overthrow

18:38.885 --> 18:40.751
The entire universe.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.787
For about
point-five seconds.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.322
The iridium core
in your device

18:44.324 --> 18:47.825
Opens an enticing window,
and that's about it.

18:47.827 --> 18:48.893
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

18:48.895 --> 18:53.831
Enough!

18:53.833 --> 18:55.833
Iron man: Once your
teammates crossed through,

18:55.835 --> 18:58.336
The tesseract would
handle the dirty work.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.605
A trans-dimensional
guillotine.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.508
Nice and neat.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.642
What?

19:04.644 --> 19:07.745
Skull? Does he
speak the truth?

19:07.747 --> 19:12.183
You were sending us
to our doom?

19:12.185 --> 19:14.318
Iron man:
Skull has a hard time
playing with others.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.420
Hate to admit it...
Kind of like me.

19:16.422 --> 19:19.924
He was afraid I'd see this
exodus for what it really is.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.626
A double-cross.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.361
Skull!

19:23.363 --> 19:25.730
There can
only be one ruler!

19:25.732 --> 19:26.931
You villain!

19:26.933 --> 19:30.601
Villain? Visionary.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.471
The greatest this world
has ever seen.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.872
You should have
learned by now,

19:34.874 --> 19:37.775
No matter how many
tin men you throw at me,

19:37.777 --> 19:39.944
I will triumph!

19:39.946 --> 19:42.580
Don't count on it.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.416
Red skull:
Stark!

19:45.418 --> 19:46.884
Have to give you
props, skull.

19:46.886 --> 19:51.556
You managed to get in
my head and hoped my
heart would follow.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.558
But you forgot
one important detail.

19:53.560 --> 20:03.601
My heart does this.

20:03.603 --> 20:08.706
My heart does this.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.977
What happened?

20:12.979 --> 20:14.478
Tony happened.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.948
Looks like he happened
all over the place.

20:16.950 --> 20:19.217
Does this mean I
finally get to lead?

20:19.219 --> 20:23.588
Iron man:
You'd have to talk
to cap about that.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.757
Nice work, rookie.
Looking for a job?

20:26.759 --> 20:30.595
We got an open spot.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.929
I'll think about it.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.497
I hear you guys
got potential.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.900
Uh, hey? Sorry to
break up this bromance,

20:35.902 --> 20:38.603
But anyone got an idea
where skull went?

20:38.605 --> 20:41.272
Red skull: Where I
belong, hawkeye.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.374
(coughing)

20:43.376 --> 20:49.413
And where I belong...

20:49.415 --> 20:55.920
Is everywhere!

20:55.922 --> 21:01.826
(grunting)

21:01.828 --> 21:07.965
(all groaning)

21:07.967 --> 21:18.209
(red skull laughs)

21:18.211 --> 21:24.415
(red skull laughs)

21:24.417 --> 21:25.816
Cosmic skull?

21:25.818 --> 21:28.419
That's "end of
the universe" bad.
