05:56.898 --> 05:59.199
<i> who she is, and that is one</i>
<i> of the most important</i>

05:59.334 --> 06:01.596
<i> musical figures of our time.</i>

06:01.732 --> 06:03.660
<i> Lydia Tár is many things:</i>

06:03.796 --> 06:07.097
<i> a piano performance graduate</i>
<i> at the Curtis Institute,</i>

06:07.232 --> 06:09.602
<i> Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard.</i>

06:09.737 --> 06:13.777
<i> She got her PhD in Musicology</i>
<i> from the University of Vienna,</i>

06:13.913 --> 06:16.374
<i> specializing in</i>
<i> the indigenous music</i>

06:16.509 --> 06:19.350
<i> of the Ucayali Valley</i>
<i> in Eastern Peru,</i>

06:19.486 --> 06:21.386
<i> where she spent five years</i>

06:21.521 --> 06:23.380
<i> among the Shipibo-Konibo peopl.</i>

06:23.516 --> 06:27.018
<i> As a conductor,</i>
<i> Tár began her career</i>

06:27.153 --> 06:28.385
<i> with the Cleveland Orchestra,</i>

06:28.520 --> 06:29.992
<i> one of the so-called</i>
<i> "Big Five."</i>

06:30.127 --> 06:32.291
<i> A string of</i>
<i> important posts followed,</i>

06:32.426 --> 06:34.794
<i> including</i>
<i> the Philadelphia Orchestra,</i>

06:34.929 --> 06:36.159
<i>the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,</i>

06:36.294 --> 06:37.501
<i> the Boston Symphony Orchestra,</i>

06:37.636 --> 06:39.406
<i> until she at last arrived here</i>

06:39.541 --> 06:42.506
<i> at our own</i>
<i> New York Philharmonic.</i>

06:42.641 --> 06:43.973
<i> With the latter, she organized</i>

06:44.108 --> 06:46.580
<i> the Highway 10</i>
<i> refugee concerts in Zaatari,</i>

06:46.715 --> 06:50.979
<i> which were attended</i>
<i> by over 75,000 people.</i>

06:51.115 --> 06:52.651
<i> She's become particularly</i>
<i> well-known</i>

06:52.787 --> 06:54.479
<i> for commissioning</i>
<i> contemporary work</i>

06:54.615 --> 06:57.689
<i> from, among others,</i>
<i> Jennifer Higdon, Caroline Shaw,</i>

06:57.824 --> 07:00.155
<i> Julia Wolfe</i>
<i> and Hildur Gudnadóttir.</i>

07:00.290 --> 07:03.321
<i> And she's made a point</i>
<i> of programming their works</i>

07:03.456 --> 07:06.398
<i> alongside composers</i>
<i> of the canon.</i>

07:06.533 --> 07:07.832
<i> She's been quoted as saying,</i>

07:07.968 --> 07:10.669
<i> "These composers</i>
<i> are having a conversation</i>

07:10.804 --> 07:13.665
<i> and it may not always</i>
<i> be so polite."</i>

07:13.800 --> 07:16.273
<i> Lydia Tár has also written</i>
<i> music for the stage and screen.</i>

07:16.408 --> 07:21.012
<i> She is in fact one of only 15</i>
<i> so-called EGOTs, meaning those</i>

07:30.726 --> 07:33.055
<i> an extremely short</i>
<i> and shimmering list</i>

07:33.191 --> 07:36.224

<i> Audrey Hepburn,</i>

<i> Andrew Lloyd Webber</i>
<i> and, of course, Mel Brooks.</i>

07:40.269 --> 07:42.999
<i> (audience laughing)</i>

07:44.169 --> 07:47.365
GOPNIK: In 2010, with
the support of Eliot Kaplan,

07:47.501 --> 07:50.371
she founded the Accordion
Conducting Fellowship,

07:50.507 --> 07:53.404
which fosters entrepreneurship
and performance opportunities

07:53.540 --> 07:56.616
for female conductors,
allowing them residencies

07:56.751 --> 07:59.544
with major orchestras
around the world.

07:59.680 --> 08:04.653
In 2013, Berlin elected Tár
as its principal conductor,

08:04.789 --> 08:07.251
in succession to Andris Davis,

08:07.387 --> 08:10.221
and she's remained there
ever since.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.060
Like her mentor,
Leonard Bernstein,

08:12.195 --> 08:15.226
Tár has a particular
affinity for Mahler,

08:15.362 --> 08:17.402
whose nine symphonies
she recorded

08:17.537 --> 08:19.696
during her Big Five stints.

08:20.599 --> 08:22.171
However, she never managed
to complete

08:22.307 --> 08:25.903
the so-called "cycle" with
a single orchestra until now.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.308
Under her direction,

08:27.443 --> 08:29.408
Berlin has recorded eight
of the Mahler symphonies,

08:29.543 --> 08:32.244
saving the big one,
Symphony No. 5, for last.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.314
Due to the pandemic,
that performance,

08:34.450 --> 08:37.081
which was scheduled for
last year, had to be canceled.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.923
But I'm told that next month,

08:39.058 --> 08:41.624
she'll make a live recording
of Mahler's Fifth,

08:41.760 --> 08:43.257
which will complete the cycle

08:43.392 --> 08:46.928
and will be issued in a box set
by Deutsche Grammophon

08:47.064 --> 08:49.099
just in time
for Mahler's birthday.

08:49.235 --> 08:52.970
As if that's not enough,
her new book,<i> Tár on Tár,</i>

08:53.106 --> 08:56.766
will be published by Nan
Talese's imprint at Doubleday,

08:56.902 --> 08:59.943
just in time for Christmas,
a perfect stocking stuffer,

09:00.079 --> 09:02.346
especially if you have
a very large stocking.

09:02.482 --> 09:03.881

09:04.016 --> 09:05.552
All of us at<i> The New Yorker</i>
welcome you.

09:05.688 --> 09:07.386
Thank you for joining us,
Maestro, today.

09:07.521 --> 09:09.213
Thank you, Adam. Thank you.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.823
-(applause)
-Thank you.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.059
Lydia, I couldn't...

09:15.194 --> 09:18.396
I couldn't help but see you
flinch just a little bit

09:18.532 --> 09:20.030
as I was reading your bio.

09:20.165 --> 09:22.129
Was it because I forgot
some other amazing achievement?

09:22.265 --> 09:24.636
Or do you have
a slight self-consciousness

09:24.772 --> 09:26.800
about the incredibly
varied things

09:26.936 --> 09:28.841
that you've accomplished?

09:28.976 --> 09:33.975
Well, in today's world,
"varied," it-it's a dirty word.

09:34.111 --> 09:36.079
I mean,
our era is one of specialists,

09:36.214 --> 09:39.013
and if you're trying to do
more than one thing,

09:39.149 --> 09:40.815
it's, you know,
it's often frowned upon.

09:40.950 --> 09:42.420
Every artist gets typecast.

09:42.556 --> 09:43.922
Oh, yes. Aggressively so.

09:44.057 --> 09:45.690
Well, do you think there'll be
a moment, though,

09:45.825 --> 09:47.859
when the classical music
community,

09:47.994 --> 09:51.330
uh, decides not to use
sexual distinctions

09:51.466 --> 09:53.500
to differentiate artists?

09:53.636 --> 09:55.700
I'm probably
the wrong person to ask

09:55.836 --> 09:58.161
since I don't, uh,
read reviews.

09:58.297 --> 09:59.730
-Never, really?
-No.

09:59.866 --> 10:03.941
But it is odd, I-I think,
that anyone ever felt compelled

10:04.076 --> 10:06.913
to substitute
"maestro" with "maestra."

10:07.049 --> 10:10.244
I mean, we don't call women
astronauts "astronettes."

10:10.379 --> 10:12.015
-GOPNIK: Mm-hmm. Right.
-(audience chuckling)

10:12.150 --> 10:15.788
But as to the question
of, uh, gender bias,

10:15.923 --> 10:18.353
I really have nothing
to complain about.

10:18.489 --> 10:21.519
Nor, for that matter, should
Marin Alsop, JoAnn Falletta,

10:21.654 --> 10:23.795
uh, Laurence Equilbey
and Nathalie Stutzmann.

10:23.930 --> 10:26.562
I mean, there's so many
incredible women

10:26.698 --> 10:28.031
who came before us.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.467
You know, women who did
the-the real lifting.

10:30.603 --> 10:31.701
That-that's fascinating.

10:31.837 --> 10:33.700
Can you... Who, for instance?

10:33.835 --> 10:34.938
Uh, okay, sure.

10:35.073 --> 10:37.139
Uh, first and foremost,
Nadia Boulanger.

10:37.274 --> 10:40.107
I mean, that would be
the, uh, happy example.

10:40.243 --> 10:43.377
Uh, the sad one would be
Antonia Brico,

10:43.512 --> 10:46.281
who by all accounts
was an incredible conductor

10:46.416 --> 10:49.652
but was ghettoized
into the nonglamorous status

10:49.787 --> 10:51.723
of a "guest conductor"

10:51.859 --> 10:54.627
and essentially
treated as a dog act.

10:54.763 --> 10:56.890
A dog...
Uh, she never got the chance

10:57.026 --> 10:58.060
to lead a major orchestra?

10:58.195 --> 11:00.130
Well, yes.
Yes, she did, uh, conduct

11:00.266 --> 11:02.559
the, uh, Berlin Philharmonic,
as well as the Met,

11:02.695 --> 11:05.728
but, again,
only as a guest conductor.

11:05.864 --> 11:07.572
You know, at, I mean,
at that time it was...

11:07.707 --> 11:09.838
it was all gender spectacle.

11:09.974 --> 11:11.502
But fortunately, times change,

11:11.637 --> 11:13.242
and-and the Pauline
conversion is...

11:13.377 --> 11:15.075
-(chuckling): "Pauline..."
-... if not complete,

11:15.210 --> 11:16.750
then it's-it's evolving nicely.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.410
N-No less, um,
having fallen off its horse.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.686
Um, Lydia, could we talk
a little bit

11:21.821 --> 11:23.821
-about, uh, translation?
-Mm-hmm.

11:23.957 --> 11:25.453
'Cause I think
there's still people

11:25.589 --> 11:28.960
who think of the conductor
as a kind of human metronome.

11:30.129 --> 11:32.864
Well, yeah,
that's-that's partly true.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.697
-Yeah, but it's...
-But keeping time,

11:34.833 --> 11:36.265
it's-it's no small thing.

11:36.401 --> 11:38.462
But I suspect there's
a lot more to it than that.

11:38.598 --> 11:39.968
Yeah, well,
I-I would hope so, yes.

11:40.104 --> 11:42.766
-But time is the thing.
-Uh-huh.

11:42.902 --> 11:46.974
Time is-is the essential piece
of, uh, interpretation.

11:47.109 --> 11:48.776
You cannot start without me.

11:48.912 --> 11:50.850
See, I start the clock.

11:50.986 --> 11:54.283
Now, my left hand shapes,
but my right hand,

11:54.419 --> 11:58.783
the second hand, marks time
and moves it forward.

11:58.918 --> 12:02.660
However, unlike a clock,
sometimes my second hand stops,

12:02.795 --> 12:05.798
which means that time stops.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.968
Now, the illusion is that,
like you,

12:09.103 --> 12:11.204
I'm responding to
the orchestra in real time...

12:11.339 --> 12:13.464
-Right, right. -... making the
decision about the right moment

12:13.600 --> 12:14.973
to restart the thing,
or reset it,

12:15.108 --> 12:17.801
or throw time out
the window altogether.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.977
The reality is that right
from the very beginning,

12:21.112 --> 12:23.080
I know precisely
what time it is...

12:23.216 --> 12:25.018
-Really? That's...
-... and the exact moment

12:25.154 --> 12:28.019
that you and I will arrive
at our destination together.

12:28.154 --> 12:31.686
You know, the only real,
uh, discovery for me

12:31.821 --> 12:33.583
is in rehearsal.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.490
It's never,
never in performance.

12:35.626 --> 12:39.524
Hard question, I know, but
if you could define one thing

12:39.660 --> 12:42.528
that Bernstein gave you,
what would it be?

12:44.306 --> 12:45.770
Kavvanah.

12:45.905 --> 12:47.102
Yeah, it's-it's the Hebrew word

12:47.238 --> 12:50.041
for attention to meaning
or-or intent.

12:50.177 --> 12:51.903
You know, what are
the composer's priorities,

12:52.038 --> 12:54.178
and what are yours, and how do
they complement one another?

12:54.313 --> 12:56.181
Right, kavvanah. I think
that's a word that will have

12:56.317 --> 12:58.381
a slightly different meaning
for many in our audience.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.721
-Well, yes, yes, I imagine so.
-(audience murmuring)

13:01.857 --> 13:03.087
Am I right in thinking
that a conductor

13:03.222 --> 13:05.858
was not always, uh,
an onstage presence

13:05.994 --> 13:07.290
-in classical music?
-No, that's right.

13:07.425 --> 13:09.359
I-I think I read someplace
that it actually was

13:09.495 --> 13:11.427
the first violin, for a long
time, who was responsible.

13:11.563 --> 13:14.258
Yes, the first violinist,
whether they had any interest

13:14.394 --> 13:15.858
or-or skill in it or not.

13:15.994 --> 13:18.697
Wh-When did that change,
and-and who changed it?

13:18.832 --> 13:21.865
With the French composer,
Jean-Baptiste Lully,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.870
who reportedly, uh,
used a, uh, rather enormous,

13:26.006 --> 13:29.879
rather pointy staff to pound
the tempi into the floor.

13:30.014 --> 13:31.148
It's not something I imagine

13:31.283 --> 13:33.614
the players particularly,
uh, appreciated.

13:33.750 --> 13:37.555
Uh, anyway, uh, that technique
ended during a performance

13:37.691 --> 13:39.554
when Lully accidentally

13:39.689 --> 13:41.885
stabbed himself in the foot
with the thing and died.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.726
-(audience laughter)
-Yeah, of-of-of gangrene.

13:44.862 --> 13:46.631
But anyway...

13:46.766 --> 13:49.502
-(applause)
-Yeah.

13:49.638 --> 13:52.896
Anyway, but the conductor

13:53.031 --> 13:56.633
really becomes essential
as the ensembles get bigger.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.177
And once again,
we go back to Beethoven.

13:59.312 --> 14:02.245
♪ Buh, buh, buh, bum,
buh, buh, buh, bum. ♪

14:02.380 --> 14:04.279
Now, that doesn't start
with the eighth note.

14:04.414 --> 14:06.848
The downbeat--
♪ Buh, buh, buh ♪--

14:06.984 --> 14:08.645
it's silent, right?

14:08.781 --> 14:11.156
So someone had to start
that clock.

14:11.291 --> 14:14.155
Someone had to, uh,
plant their flag in the sand

14:14.290 --> 14:16.855
and say, "Follow me," you know?

14:16.991 --> 14:20.263
And when that someone was
Lenny, the orchestra was led

14:20.399 --> 14:24.432
on the most extraordinary
tour of pleasures.

14:24.568 --> 14:27.497
'Cause he knew the music,
Mahler especially,

14:27.633 --> 14:29.633
as well or better than anyone.

14:29.768 --> 14:32.944
And he would often play
with the form.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.342
'Cause he wanted an orchestra
to feel

14:34.478 --> 14:36.607
that they had never seen,
let alone heard

14:36.742 --> 14:39.610
or-or performed
any of that music.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.887
So he-he would do
radical things,

14:42.023 --> 14:44.154
like, uh, disregarding
the tempo primo

14:44.290 --> 14:46.683
or-or ending this phrase
molto ritardando,

14:46.819 --> 14:49.320
even though
it had no such marking.

14:49.455 --> 14:50.696
Was he over-egging it?

14:50.831 --> 14:52.197
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

14:52.332 --> 14:55.998
He, he, he celebrated the joy
of his discovery.

14:56.134 --> 14:57.532
You just told us a moment ago

14:57.667 --> 15:00.039
that your discovery
takes place in rehearsal.

15:00.174 --> 15:02.668
When will that process
begin again for you?

15:03.612 --> 15:04.907
We start on Monday.

15:05.043 --> 15:06.879
-Immediately?
-Mm.

15:07.015 --> 15:09.314
With this one,
it really is about

15:09.450 --> 15:13.843
trying to read the tea leaves
of-of Mahler's intention.

15:13.979 --> 15:15.478
I mean, we know a great deal
about this

15:15.614 --> 15:17.146
with his other symphonies.

15:17.282 --> 15:19.389
You know, he was so inspired
by the poetry of Rückert

15:19.524 --> 15:21.828
that for years he didn't set
another author to music.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.828
But all of this changes
with the Five.

15:24.963 --> 15:27.161
The Five is a mystery.

15:27.297 --> 15:29.936
And the only clue he leaves us

15:30.072 --> 15:32.004
is on the cover
of the manuscript itself.

15:32.140 --> 15:36.008
Yes, the-the dedication
to his new wife, Alma.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.007
So if you're gonna partner
with Mahler

15:38.142 --> 15:40.845
on his, uh, fifth symphony,

15:40.980 --> 15:42.379
the first thing you must do

15:42.514 --> 15:46.846
is try to understand
that very complex marriage.

15:46.982 --> 15:49.714
And would you say that you have
a different interpretation

15:49.849 --> 15:52.157
of that marriage
than Bernstein did?

15:53.692 --> 15:58.126
You mentioned my ethnographic
fieldwork in the Amazon.

15:58.262 --> 16:00.933
Well, Adam, the Shipibo-Konibo

16:01.068 --> 16:03.703
only receive an<i> icaro,</i> or song,

16:03.839 --> 16:05.436
if the singer is there, right?

16:05.572 --> 16:09.308
On the same side of the-the
spirit that-that created it.

16:09.443 --> 16:12.903
And in that way, the past
and the present converge.

16:13.038 --> 16:16.413
It's the flip sides
of the same cosmic coin.

16:16.548 --> 16:19.413
That definition of fidelity
makes sense to me.

16:19.549 --> 16:21.944
But Lenny,
he believed in<i> teshuvah.</i>

16:22.080 --> 16:24.387
The Talmudic power
to reach back into time

16:24.522 --> 16:27.384
and-and transform
the, uh, significance

16:27.520 --> 16:28.954
of one's past deeds.

16:29.090 --> 16:33.094
So when he played the Adagietto
at Robert Kennedy's funeral,

16:33.229 --> 16:35.266
it ran for 12 minutes.

16:35.402 --> 16:37.731
-He treated it as a mass.
-(agreeing murmur)

16:37.867 --> 16:39.568
And, you know, if you listen
to a recording of it,

16:39.703 --> 16:43.338
you will no doubt feel
the tragedy and-and the pathos.

16:43.474 --> 16:46.011
And of course
that, uh, interpretation

16:46.147 --> 16:48.147
was very true for Mahler
later in life,

16:48.282 --> 16:50.246
after the professional bottom
dropped out

16:50.382 --> 16:52.316
and Alma had left him
for Gropius.

16:52.452 --> 16:57.586
But, as I said before,
we are dealing with time.

16:57.721 --> 17:02.157
And this piece was not born
into aching tragedy.

17:02.292 --> 17:04.597
It was born into young love.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.861
And so you chose...

17:06.996 --> 17:08.432
Love.

17:08.568 --> 17:11.462
-(audience murmuring)
-Right, but precisely how long?

17:11.597 --> 17:12.868
(quietly):
Well...

17:13.004 --> 17:14.936
seven minutes.

17:15.071 --> 17:17.341
(laughter)

17:19.071 --> 17:21.978
WOMAN: I was so taken
by what you said to Adam

17:22.114 --> 17:25.279
about, um, interpretation

17:25.414 --> 17:28.786
and specifically about feelings,

17:28.922 --> 17:31.181
and that you chose love.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.517
And I know it's said
that you should leave the tears

17:34.653 --> 17:36.624
for the audience, but...

17:36.760 --> 17:39.394
do you ever find yourself
overwhelmed by emotion

17:39.530 --> 17:41.130
when you're up there
at the podium?

17:41.265 --> 17:43.032
-TÁR: Yes.
-(sighs)

17:43.167 --> 17:44.995
Yes, that does happen.

17:45.130 --> 17:48.139
There's an...
an expectation-reward cycle

17:48.275 --> 17:50.243
with some works
and the spots in them

17:50.378 --> 17:53.177
that I find so incredible,
that when I'm conducting,

17:53.313 --> 17:55.578
it's not that
I'm rushing exactly,

17:55.713 --> 17:58.316
but, oh, I just can't wait
to get to that spot,

17:58.452 --> 18:00.751
and, yeah, it does it.
It does it every time.

18:00.886 --> 18:02.319
(laughs softly)

18:02.455 --> 18:04.320
So it's physical
as well as emotional.

18:04.455 --> 18:06.320
-Hmm. Hmm.
-God, it must take hours

18:06.455 --> 18:08.559
to come back down to earth.

18:08.694 --> 18:12.029
You say things after others
remember, but you won't.

18:12.164 --> 18:14.265
And sleep, it's impossible.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.393
It's like my freshman year
at Smith.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.327
(Tár chuckles)

18:18.463 --> 18:19.663
(sighs)

18:19.799 --> 18:21.497
Which piece does that to you?

18:21.633 --> 18:22.934
Oh, I saw you.

18:23.070 --> 18:25.206
I saw you conduct, uh,
<i> The Rite of Spring</i>

18:25.341 --> 18:26.712
at the Met last year.

18:26.848 --> 18:28.839
It was so powerful.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.017
TÁR:
Thank you. Thank you.

18:31.152 --> 18:34.017
It's...
It's the 11 pistol shots--

18:34.152 --> 18:35.386
it's a prime number--

18:35.521 --> 18:37.881
that strike you as both victim
and perpetrator.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.457
You know, it's not until
I conducted it

18:39.592 --> 18:43.196
that I became convinced
we're all capable of murder.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.955
That is a fantastic handbag,
by the way.

18:46.091 --> 18:48.524
Thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

18:48.659 --> 18:50.127
Oh, I do. I do.

18:50.262 --> 18:52.035
(quietly): Sorry.
Your lunch with Mr. Kaplan.

18:52.170 --> 18:53.771
His driver is waiting.

18:53.906 --> 18:55.031
All right.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.207
I-I'm sorry,
I've forgotten your name.

18:56.342 --> 18:57.809
-Whitney. Whitney Reese.
-Whitney.

18:57.945 --> 18:58.942
Whitney, of course.

18:59.077 --> 19:00.445
I'm, I'm so sorry,

19:00.580 --> 19:02.138
and unfortunately
I've left things a bit late

19:02.273 --> 19:03.539
-and there's something
I can't get out of. -Oh.

19:03.675 --> 19:04.716
I understand.

19:04.851 --> 19:07.253
Can I text you?

19:26.369 --> 19:28.571
It's perfect, Aldo.

19:31.202 --> 19:33.602
Oh. I was hoping
we could celebrate.

19:33.738 --> 19:35.739
No. So was I.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.408
I've got a class at Juilliard.

19:37.543 --> 19:38.574
Oh, good.

19:38.709 --> 19:40.112
I promised Ben.

19:40.248 --> 19:43.685
I'm sure you'll have a few
elbowing for an Accordion slot.

19:44.588 --> 19:47.260
We should open up
the fellowship.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.593
-What, expand our numbers?
-No, our sex.

19:49.729 --> 19:52.931
I mean, it feels quaint
to keep things single-gender.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.266
We've made our point.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.025
And, honestly,
we've had no real trouble

19:56.161 --> 19:58.000
successfully placing
any of them.

19:58.135 --> 19:59.936
Except one.

20:00.071 --> 20:01.707
Oh, well.

20:01.842 --> 20:03.841
She had issues.

20:03.977 --> 20:05.476
So I've heard.

20:05.612 --> 20:07.603
The topic comes up
in every Citibank meeting

20:07.738 --> 20:10.014
with her father.

20:10.149 --> 20:11.618
I'm sorry about that.

20:11.753 --> 20:12.809
It's fine.

20:12.944 --> 20:15.115
It's nothing I can't handle.

20:16.084 --> 20:20.320
So, you want to torpedo
Accordion's founding principle?

20:20.456 --> 20:22.357
We'd likely lose donors.

20:22.492 --> 20:24.955
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.031
M-Maybe it's something
we revisit

20:27.166 --> 20:29.027
-down the line.
-Sure.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.533
Now, Bryant Park's locked
for the 25th.

20:31.669 --> 20:33.635
Nan asked me
to help fill the place,

20:33.771 --> 20:35.467
so the Kaplan Fund
is gonna buy some radio

20:35.603 --> 20:37.633
and outdoor advertising.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.812
And claqueurs.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.136
It's too big, Eliot.

20:41.272 --> 20:42.681
She should have booked
the Strand.

20:42.816 --> 20:44.013
Relax.

20:44.148 --> 20:46.252
It'll be great.

20:46.388 --> 20:48.783
And it almost falls
on your birthday.

20:50.690 --> 20:53.091
I was, uh, I was sorry
you weren't able to make it

20:53.227 --> 20:55.295
to my Mahler Three in London.

20:56.126 --> 20:57.825
Me, too.

20:59.167 --> 21:01.532
Uh, Petra had a school thing.

21:01.667 --> 21:06.306
Uh, and I promised Sharon
I'd be there.

21:07.336 --> 21:09.341
Of course.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.576
I was just hoping
for your honest opinion.

21:12.711 --> 21:15.443
My player rating sheets
were off the charts.

21:15.579 --> 21:17.416
Those are confidential, Eliot.

21:17.551 --> 21:19.847
Well, the principal oboist
is a big fan.

21:21.086 --> 21:22.355
On the way back,

21:22.490 --> 21:24.181
I was listening to yours
with the Israeli Phil,

21:24.317 --> 21:26.182
and I was struck
by what you managed to pull

21:26.318 --> 21:28.524
from the strings
in the last movement.

21:28.660 --> 21:32.127
I mean, how did you
get them there?

21:32.262 --> 21:33.690
Was it the hall?

21:33.826 --> 21:35.291
Was it the players?

21:35.426 --> 21:38.369
(scoffs) The players weren't
very obliging.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.104
The principal violinist
came up to me

21:40.240 --> 21:41.372
after the first rehearsal

21:41.508 --> 21:43.533
-and asked if I was a Jew.
-What?

21:43.668 --> 21:46.479
It seemed to him unusual, if
not suspicious, that a non-Jew

21:46.614 --> 21:49.580
would be interested
in conducting Jewish music.

21:49.715 --> 21:52.583
-(Eliot chuckles)
-Felt like Max Bruch.

21:52.718 --> 21:56.046
Well, big Jew that I am,
the Kaplan Fund has, uh,

21:56.181 --> 21:58.048
committed a sizable
amount to them

21:58.183 --> 21:59.657
-for a klezmer commission.
-Mm-hmm.

21:59.792 --> 22:01.657
Uh, maybe they'll invite me
to guest conduct.

22:01.793 --> 22:03.719
Oh, well, they'd be lucky
to have you.

22:03.854 --> 22:05.622
Oh, please.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.597
I know my place.

22:07.733 --> 22:10.370
Money can't always
buy you everything.

22:11.305 --> 22:13.439
You don't really believe that.

22:13.575 --> 22:15.569
I'll have you know
I tried to bribe Francesca

22:15.704 --> 22:17.272
to let me look at your notation.

22:17.408 --> 22:18.844
She sent me packing.

22:18.979 --> 22:20.470
Good girl.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.106
That gentleman sitting
over there with the gnome

22:23.242 --> 22:25.484
is urgently focused
on our table.

22:25.619 --> 22:28.749
At first, I thought
he was looking at me,

22:28.885 --> 22:31.023
but I think he's got
his eye on you.

22:31.159 --> 22:32.920
Please try and ignore him.

22:33.055 --> 22:35.159
I can excuse myself
and go wash my hands

22:35.295 --> 22:36.920
if you'd like to be alone.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.796
And I would never forgive you.

22:39.932 --> 22:42.024
The last thing I need
is to be buttonholed in here

22:42.159 --> 22:44.096
by someone exactly like me.

22:45.639 --> 22:47.607
Uh, what time are you
leaving tomorrow?

22:48.443 --> 22:50.833
Francesca's looking
into flights.

22:50.969 --> 22:52.175
Well, call her off.

22:52.311 --> 22:54.002
Leave when you like.

22:54.138 --> 22:55.778
You don't have to do that.

22:55.913 --> 22:59.618
My motives are not entirely
altruistic.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.151
Just one peek. One peek
at your performing score.

23:02.287 --> 23:04.889
(Tár chuckles)

23:05.024 --> 23:06.390
Fine.

23:06.525 --> 23:09.519
-Would 5:15 be okay?
-Sure.

23:09.655 --> 23:12.494
Okay, I mean, I do... I have
to get turned around fast.

23:12.629 --> 23:14.828
We're filling a vacant position.

23:14.963 --> 23:17.002
Oh, please tell me
it's Sebastian.

23:17.138 --> 23:18.369
Now, be fair, Eliot.

23:18.504 --> 23:20.829
Sebastian has decent technique.

23:20.965 --> 23:22.231
He has baton.

23:22.367 --> 23:23.741
A month ago,
I dropped into Bunkamura

23:23.876 --> 23:26.974
to watch the Turing machine
trot out Chopin One.

23:27.109 --> 23:30.510
Ol' Sebastian really
is Mr. Tempo Rubato.

23:30.646 --> 23:32.215
Robot-o is more like it.

23:32.351 --> 23:33.551
Why do you keep him on?

23:33.686 --> 23:35.883
Oh, he's Andris's man,
you know that.

23:36.018 --> 23:37.657
Exactly. You inherited
that decision.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.658
Seven years is a long time
to pretend you respect it.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.121
They have different
labor contracts over there.

23:44.398 --> 23:47.361
He's a... he's a strange guy.

23:47.496 --> 23:48.857
Who? Andris?

23:48.993 --> 23:50.861
No, Sebastian.

23:50.996 --> 23:53.335
He has, uh, fetishes.

23:53.471 --> 23:55.333
Fetishes? Like what?

23:55.468 --> 23:59.035
Nostalgia for prewar Kalmus
miniature scores,

23:59.170 --> 24:01.004
dead-stock pencils he's seen

24:01.139 --> 24:03.039
von Karajan hold in photographs.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.007
You know, that sort of thing.

24:05.143 --> 24:07.487
(scoffs)
That's just sad.

24:11.556 --> 24:14.021
Yeah, but you're not wrong.

24:14.156 --> 24:17.156
I am gonna have to rotate him
at some point.

24:19.428 --> 24:21.831
For who?

24:26.164 --> 24:27.601
<i> What Love Teaches Me.</i>

24:27.736 --> 24:30.004
That string notation.

24:31.445 --> 24:33.678
Mahler gives it to you himself.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.382
-Come on.
-Trust me.

24:37.517 --> 24:38.880
You do not want to go to school

24:39.016 --> 24:41.416
on someone else's
red and blue pencil.

24:41.552 --> 24:43.054
Least of all, mine.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.547
Oh, but I do.

24:44.682 --> 24:45.956
(sighs) All right.
Will you quit pestering me?

24:46.092 --> 24:48.059
Yes.

24:48.194 --> 24:50.189
Free bowing.

24:51.622 --> 24:53.929
It's not pretty
for an audience to look at,

24:54.064 --> 24:55.562
but if you can manage
to keep your players

24:55.698 --> 24:57.570
out of the weeds...

24:58.405 --> 25:00.606
... the sound's ferocious.

25:02.207 --> 25:04.104
Oh.

25:07.538 --> 25:10.583
There's no glory
for a robot, Eliot.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.215
Do your own thing.

25:18.322 --> 25:20.593
Hmm.

25:24.265 --> 25:25.926
(piano plays deep chord)

25:26.062 --> 25:28.568
(playing "Ró"
by Anna Thorvaldsdóttir)

25:31.802 --> 25:34.068
-(hollow thump)
-(soft knock)

25:36.070 --> 25:38.367
-(soft knock)
-(hollow thump)

25:38.503 --> 25:40.970
-All right, um...
-(playing stops)

25:41.106 --> 25:43.615
Let's... stop here.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.451
-Thank you, Max. Very good.
-Thanks.

25:45.586 --> 25:50.388
Um, just for my own
edification...

25:50.524 --> 25:52.619
why did you come to Juilliard?

25:52.755 --> 25:54.959
(Max clicks tongue)

25:55.995 --> 25:58.194
Uh, it's the best music
conservatory in the country?

25:58.329 --> 26:01.324
People from Curtis, Eastman,
and others may beg to differ.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.801
I mean,
Juilliard's a brand, right?

26:03.936 --> 26:06.637
So, did you come to study
with a brand?

26:06.773 --> 26:08.906
-No. -No, right.
So there's a teacher

26:09.042 --> 26:11.335
or graduate somewhere
down the line who, you know,

26:11.471 --> 26:12.843
conjured something
in your imagination.

26:12.978 --> 26:15.213
-Someone you aspire
to be yourself. -Mm-hmm.

26:15.348 --> 26:16.972
So, who was that?

26:17.107 --> 26:18.482
Sarah Chang.

26:18.617 --> 26:20.385
Hmm. So you're a violinist?

26:20.520 --> 26:22.154
-Yeah.
-All right, okay.

26:22.290 --> 26:23.756
Well, I can see why

26:23.891 --> 26:26.484
you would choose to conduct
a piece like this.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.893
Must be a familiar pleasure
in presiding over

26:29.029 --> 26:31.727
a bed of strings that behave
as if they're tuning.

26:31.862 --> 26:33.695
-(scattered laughter)
-Now...

26:33.831 --> 26:38.329
this piece is very au courant.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.838
I mean, here,
the composer tells us

26:40.973 --> 26:43.007
to begin with "back-and-forth
tremolo strokes

26:43.143 --> 26:47.043
with wire brush and slowly
sliding crotales over skin."

26:47.178 --> 26:49.609
Sounds like René Redzepi's
recipe for reindeer.

26:49.744 --> 26:51.211
(sighs heavily)

26:51.346 --> 26:54.010
It's exciting to play
new music, isn't it?

26:54.146 --> 26:55.348
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

26:55.483 --> 26:58.823
Great. All right, please,
join the other fellows.

27:00.157 --> 27:03.619
Now, I know you're all
conducting students

27:03.754 --> 27:06.398
of, uh, Mr. Wolfe's,
but how many of you

27:06.534 --> 27:09.597
are also studying composition?

27:09.733 --> 27:11.202
Right, what's your name?

27:11.337 --> 27:12.633
Olive Kerr.

27:12.769 --> 27:15.204
All right, Olive. Uh...

27:15.340 --> 27:17.704
What do you make of what
we've just been listening to?

27:17.840 --> 27:19.711
It's pretty awesome.

27:19.847 --> 27:22.778
I mean, there's incredible
atonal tension.

27:22.913 --> 27:25.115
I agree about the tension part.

27:25.251 --> 27:28.985
Now, you can intellectually
contemplate, or masturbate,

27:29.121 --> 27:32.914
about the felicity
of the so-called "atonal,"

27:33.050 --> 27:38.593
but the important question here
is: What are you conducting?

27:38.729 --> 27:39.893
What is the effect?

27:40.028 --> 27:42.899
What is it actually doing to me?

27:43.035 --> 27:46.767
Good music can be
as ornate as a cathedral

27:46.903 --> 27:49.007
or bare as a potting shed

27:49.143 --> 27:52.510
so long as it allows you to
answer both those questions.

27:52.645 --> 27:54.743
-(claps hands)
-Max.

27:54.878 --> 27:57.211
Come on, what do you think?

28:00.120 --> 28:04.922
When... Anna Thorvaldsdóttir
gave her master class,

28:05.058 --> 28:08.951
she said she was often
influenced by the form

28:09.086 --> 28:14.459
and structure of landscapes
and nature she grew up within.

28:14.594 --> 28:16.834
But I'm not sure
she was interested per se

28:16.970 --> 28:20.163
in, uh, describing
those actual sounds.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.841
Very<i> Punkt Kontra Punkt.</i>

28:24.068 --> 28:25.473
Yes.

28:25.608 --> 28:30.279
The intent of her composition
is vague, to say the least.

28:30.415 --> 28:35.181
So, if her intent is vague,
how do you, as a conductor,

28:35.317 --> 28:38.785
have a point of view
about anything?

28:38.921 --> 28:40.354
Now, to be fair, I mean,

28:40.489 --> 28:42.885
there are times when you will
simply have no choice.

28:43.021 --> 28:45.393
And you will be made to stand
in front of an orchestra

28:45.529 --> 28:48.697
and pretend that there are
these invisible structures.

28:48.832 --> 28:51.793
But my prayer for you

28:51.929 --> 28:54.004
is that you will be spared
the embarrassment

28:54.139 --> 28:56.302
of standing on the podium
with a 4'33",

28:56.438 --> 28:58.970
trying to sell a car
without an engine.

28:59.106 --> 29:01.304
Because now, my friends,

29:01.439 --> 29:04.509
now is the time to conduct music

29:04.644 --> 29:07.852
that actually requires
something of you.

29:07.987 --> 29:09.483
You know,
music that everybody knows

29:09.619 --> 29:14.154
but will hear differently
when you interpret it for them.

29:14.289 --> 29:18.021
For instance, Max,
why not a Kyrie?

29:18.156 --> 29:23.225
You know, like, uh, something
like Bach's<i> Mass in B minor.</i>

29:23.361 --> 29:24.766
(chuckles nervously)

29:24.902 --> 29:26.737
I'm not really into Bach.

29:26.872 --> 29:29.503
-You're not into Bach?
-Mm-hmm.

29:29.639 --> 29:31.438
Oh, Max.

29:32.341 --> 29:34.442
Have you read
the Schweitzer book?

29:34.578 --> 29:36.205
No.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.679
Well, you should.

29:37.815 --> 29:40.013
It's an important text.

29:40.149 --> 29:42.417
Now, Antonia Brico thought so.

29:42.553 --> 29:45.354
So much so that she shipped
herself to Equatorial Africa

29:45.490 --> 29:48.190
and canoed up the Congo River
to track Schweitzer down

29:48.325 --> 29:51.358
and ask him to teach her
what he knew about Bach.

29:51.494 --> 29:53.365
I mean, somewhere,
I've got a picture of her

29:53.501 --> 29:55.598
in a, in a pith helmet.

29:55.734 --> 29:57.067
I mean, have you...

29:57.202 --> 30:01.104
have you ever played
or-or conducted Bach?

30:01.239 --> 30:06.778
Honestly, as a BIPOC,
pangender person,

30:06.914 --> 30:08.714
I would say Bach's
misogynistic life

30:08.849 --> 30:11.715
makes it kind of impossible
for me

30:11.850 --> 30:14.249
to take his music seriously.

30:15.685 --> 30:17.286
Come on.

30:17.421 --> 30:20.253
What do... what do...
what do you mean by that?

30:20.389 --> 30:24.429
Well, didn't he sire,
like, 20 kids?

30:24.565 --> 30:26.591
Yes, that's documented.

30:26.726 --> 30:30.164
Along with a considerable
amount of music.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.764
But I'm sorry,
I'm... I'm unclear

30:32.899 --> 30:35.407
as to what his prodigious
skills in the marital bed

30:35.543 --> 30:38.573
have to do with B minor.

30:38.708 --> 30:40.012
Sure.

30:40.147 --> 30:42.905
All right, whatever.
That's-that's your choice.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.776
I mean, after all, "a soul
selects her own society."

30:45.911 --> 30:48.612
But remember, the flip side
of that selection

30:48.748 --> 30:51.417
closes the valves
of one's attention.

30:51.553 --> 30:55.918
Now, of course,
siloing what is acceptable

30:56.053 --> 30:59.128
or not acceptable
is a basic construct of many,

30:59.264 --> 31:01.767
if not most,
symphony orchestras today,

31:01.902 --> 31:03.667
who see it
as their imperial right

31:03.803 --> 31:05.427
to curate for the cretins.

31:05.562 --> 31:07.270
So, slippery as it is,

31:07.405 --> 31:11.109
there is some merit
in examining Max's allergy.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.343
Can classical music
written by a bunch of straight,

31:14.478 --> 31:17.774
Austro-German, churchgoing
white guys exalt us,

31:17.909 --> 31:20.150
individually
as-as well as collectively,

31:20.285 --> 31:24.286
and who, may I ask,
gets to decide that?

31:25.289 --> 31:27.656
(sighs)
You know, what about Beethoven?

31:27.792 --> 31:29.619
You into him?

31:29.755 --> 31:32.293
Because for me,
as a U-Haul lesbian,

31:32.429 --> 31:35.660
I'm... I'm not too sure
about old Ludwig.

31:36.769 --> 31:40.034
But then, I face him.

31:40.170 --> 31:42.303
And I find myself nose-to-nose

31:42.438 --> 31:47.012
with his magnitude
and inevitability.

31:49.178 --> 31:52.145
Come on, Max. Indulge me.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.651
Let's allow Bach a similar gaze.

31:55.786 --> 31:57.079
(inhales deeply)

31:57.215 --> 32:00.258
(playing Bach's Präludium
und Fuge C-Dur. BWV 846)

32:00.394 --> 32:01.961
Sit.

32:04.788 --> 32:07.495
Now, this is all
filigree, right?

32:07.630 --> 32:12.334
I mean, it could be
a first-year piano student.

32:12.469 --> 32:17.141
♪ Or Schroeder playing
for Lucy. ♪

32:19.043 --> 32:21.475
Or Glenn Gould, for that matter.

32:26.053 --> 32:28.548
Now, it's not until
it changes...

32:29.746 --> 32:31.052
... when you get inside it,

32:31.187 --> 32:32.688
that you hear what it really is.

32:32.823 --> 32:34.521
It's a question.

32:36.927 --> 32:39.031
And an answer.

32:40.658 --> 32:43.266
Which begs another question.

32:45.333 --> 32:47.535
There's a humility in Bach.

32:47.670 --> 32:51.472
He's not pretending
he's certain about anything.

32:51.607 --> 32:54.636
'Cause he knows
that it's always the question

32:54.771 --> 32:57.716
that involves the listener.

32:57.852 --> 33:00.809
It's never the answer, right?

33:00.945 --> 33:04.318
Now, the big question
for you is:

33:04.454 --> 33:07.026
(growling):
What do you think, Max?

33:10.861 --> 33:12.730
(exhales)

33:12.865 --> 33:14.729
You play really well.

33:14.865 --> 33:21.005
But nowadays, white, male, cis
composers, just not my thing.

33:21.140 --> 33:25.273
Don't be so eager
to be offended.

33:25.409 --> 33:27.440
The narcissism
of small differences

33:27.576 --> 33:30.244
leads to the most boring
conformity.

33:30.379 --> 33:32.278
I guess Edgard Varèse is okay.

33:32.413 --> 33:34.252
I mean, I like "Arcana," anyway.

33:34.387 --> 33:37.283
Oh, well, then you must be
aware that Varèse

33:37.419 --> 33:39.586
once famously stated that jazz

33:39.721 --> 33:44.086
was "a Negro product
exploited by the Jews."

33:44.221 --> 33:46.757
Didn't stop Jerry Goldsmith
from ripping him off

33:46.892 --> 33:48.925
for his
<i> Planet of the Apes</i> score.

33:49.060 --> 33:51.367
It's kind of a perfect insult,
don't you think?

33:51.503 --> 33:55.139
But you see, the problem
with enrolling yourself

33:55.274 --> 33:57.639
as an ultrasonic epistemic
dissident

33:57.775 --> 34:01.344
is that if Bach's talent
can be reduced to his gender,

34:01.479 --> 34:04.616
birth country, religion,
sexuality, and so on,

34:04.751 --> 34:07.219
then so can yours.

34:07.354 --> 34:10.618
Now, someday, Max,
when you go out into the world

34:10.754 --> 34:14.392
and you guest conduct
for a major or minor orchestra,

34:14.528 --> 34:17.553
you may notice that the players
have more than light bulbs

34:17.689 --> 34:20.055
and music on their stands.

34:20.190 --> 34:23.232
They will also have been
handed rating sheets,

34:23.368 --> 34:26.232
the purpose of which
is to rate you.

34:26.368 --> 34:28.569
Now, what kind of criteria

34:28.704 --> 34:31.300
would you hope that they would
use to do this?

34:31.435 --> 34:34.674
Your score reading and stick
technique, or something else?

34:37.548 --> 34:41.017
All right, everyone,
using Max's criteria,

34:41.152 --> 34:43.814
let's consider Max's thing.

34:43.949 --> 34:46.488
In this case,
Anna Thorvaldsdóttir.

34:46.623 --> 34:50.259
Now, can we agree on two pieces
of observation?

34:50.395 --> 34:52.989
One, that Anna was born
in Iceland.

34:53.124 --> 34:55.333
And two, that she is,
in a, I don't know,

34:55.468 --> 34:57.866
Waldorf teacher kinda way,
a superhot young woman.

34:58.002 --> 34:59.895
Show of hands.

35:00.030 --> 35:02.071
All right,
now let's turn our gaze

35:02.206 --> 35:04.165
back to the piano bench up there

35:04.301 --> 35:07.412
and see if we can square
how any of those things

35:07.548 --> 35:11.748
possibly relate to the person
we see seated before us.

35:11.883 --> 35:13.746
(lid slams shut)

35:16.681 --> 35:18.421
Oh, where are you going?

35:22.060 --> 35:23.518
You're a fucking bitch.

35:23.653 --> 35:24.861
(Tár grunts)

35:24.997 --> 35:27.057
And you are a robot.

35:27.192 --> 35:29.692
I mean, unfortunately,
the architect of your soul

35:29.827 --> 35:32.361
appears to be social media.

35:32.496 --> 35:35.698
You want to dance the mask,
you must service the composer.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.042
You gotta sublimate yourself,

35:37.177 --> 35:39.905
your ego, and, yes,
your identity.

35:40.041 --> 35:42.714

to take notes? -(clicking pen)

51:11.108 --> 51:12.242
No, thank you, Sebastian.

51:12.378 --> 51:13.736
-That won't be necessary.
-(clicking stops)

51:13.872 --> 51:15.375
Do we all have
our rating sheets?

51:15.511 --> 51:17.248
-We narrowed it down to three.
-Mm-hmm.

51:17.383 --> 51:19.640
So, unless anyone has
other business to discuss,

51:19.776 --> 51:21.680
let's bring in number one.

51:23.482 --> 51:26.784
(cello playing<i> Tannhäuser und</i>
<i> der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg)</i>

51:37.394 --> 51:40.666
(cello playing<i> Verdi Messa</i>
<i> da Requiem</i> (Offertorio))

51:57.247 --> 52:00.521
(cello playing<i> Pathétique</i>
(Allegro con graza))

52:13.332 --> 52:15.239
(playing stops)

52:18.667 --> 52:20.739
(footsteps)

52:35.189 --> 52:37.426
(low chattering)

52:38.889 --> 52:41.429
Goossens stands, sounds his A.

52:41.565 --> 52:44.335
And of course, uh, Léon
was rather famous

52:44.470 --> 52:48.637
-for his, um, rather wide
vibrato, huh? -Hmm.

52:48.773 --> 52:52.236
Beecham looks up and says,
"Gentlemen, take your pick."

52:52.371 --> 52:55.009
(both chuckling)

52:55.145 --> 52:57.072
How's the writing going?

52:57.207 --> 53:00.308
Ah, I never know how
to answer that question.

53:00.444 --> 53:01.448
No.

53:01.584 --> 53:04.120
Makes it sound like
a physical act.

53:04.255 --> 53:06.085
Like, how's the shitting going?

53:06.220 --> 53:07.789
(laughing)

53:07.924 --> 53:09.090
Okay.

53:09.226 --> 53:11.091
How's the thinking going?

53:11.226 --> 53:13.462
Yeah, not so well.

53:13.597 --> 53:16.100
I keep hearing something
and getting excited

53:16.236 --> 53:19.668
only to catch myself
in pastiche.

53:19.804 --> 53:21.168
Hmm.

53:21.303 --> 53:23.437
Uh, it's all pastiche.

53:23.573 --> 53:25.943
We all have the same
musical grammar.

53:26.078 --> 53:28.777
Uh, just look at Beethoven Five.

53:28.913 --> 53:31.977
The third movement's theme has
the same sequence of intervals

53:32.113 --> 53:35.681
as the opening theme of the
final movement of Mozart Forty.

53:35.816 --> 53:38.152
Mm, th-that could've been
a coincidence.

53:38.287 --> 53:40.157
No. Not in this case.

53:40.293 --> 53:42.984
If you examine
the sketchbooks he used,

53:43.119 --> 53:47.061
29 bars of Mozart's
finale appear.

53:47.197 --> 53:49.399
Copied out by Beethoven.

53:49.534 --> 53:53.632
Oh, my God. I find that
extremely depressing.

53:53.767 --> 53:55.466
I finished reading
your manuscript.

53:55.601 --> 53:57.203
It's very good, Lydia.

53:57.338 --> 53:59.308
One for the ages.

53:59.444 --> 54:01.575
And, I dare say,
will be available

54:01.711 --> 54:03.243
long after my book
has been forgotten.

54:03.378 --> 54:04.878
Oh, yes, you're right.

54:05.013 --> 54:08.347
The entire first printing
will always be available.

54:08.482 --> 54:10.717
Too modest, as usual.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.464
Thank you, Andris.

54:22.363 --> 54:24.163
I'll cherish this.

54:24.298 --> 54:26.365
You may use it.

54:26.501 --> 54:28.834
A-a blurb for the covers.

54:30.140 --> 54:32.537
Oh, thank you.

54:32.673 --> 54:34.539
I'll send it to the publisher.

54:34.675 --> 54:36.542
Hopefully, there's still time.

54:36.677 --> 54:39.016
I'm proud to call you my pupil,

54:39.151 --> 54:40.346
uh, even though there was really

54:40.482 --> 54:41.710
nothing I could teach you.

54:41.845 --> 54:43.147
Now, that's not true.

54:43.283 --> 54:46.047
I'd never have the position
here were it not for you.

54:46.182 --> 54:48.419
Then you'd be in London,
New York.

54:48.555 --> 54:50.526
They're not Berlin.

54:51.663 --> 54:54.030
Besides, I'm not sure
what Sharon would do,

54:54.165 --> 54:55.297
were we ever to leave.

54:55.432 --> 54:57.133

54:57.269 --> 55:00.702
Ah, yeah, the Goodnow sisters.

55:00.838 --> 55:03.403
I remember the elder one
being an absolute ball-breaker

55:03.538 --> 55:06.476
while she still held sway at DG.

55:06.611 --> 55:10.638
-Heike is a woman
of many opinions. -Oh.

55:10.773 --> 55:11.710
And that voice.

55:11.845 --> 55:13.140
I mean, the signal-to-noise
ratio,

55:13.275 --> 55:15.386
-it's unbearable.
-(chuckles)

55:15.521 --> 55:17.547

55:17.683 --> 55:20.215

a woman down a flight of stairs

55:30.136 --> 55:31.232

Yes.

55:32.900 --> 55:34.402
this private

1:05:10.613 --> 1:05:12.983
Well...

1:05:14.616 --> 1:05:17.850
Then I will organize a caucus,
and we'll take a vote.

1:05:17.985 --> 1:05:20.854
No. No, you won't.

1:05:20.989 --> 1:05:23.322
A vote must be taken.

1:05:23.458 --> 1:05:25.491
I am familiar with
the electoral conclave.

1:05:25.626 --> 1:05:27.761
But the appointment
of the assistant conductor

1:05:27.897 --> 1:05:30.490
is entirely my decision.

1:05:30.625 --> 1:05:32.059

1:05:32.195 --> 1:05:33.366
Yes.

1:05:33.502 --> 1:05:36.572

support with the others?

1:05:38.641 --> 1:05:39.771
Yes.

1:05:39.906 --> 1:05:41.172
Good.

1:05:41.308 --> 1:05:42.536
Who will you replace him with?

1:05:42.671 --> 1:05:44.378
Oh. I'm considering a few names,

1:05:44.514 --> 1:05:47.684

proceed with this immediately.

KNUT:
I understand.

1:05:50.145 --> 1:05:52.219
Maestro, uh, the other players
would like to know

the companion piece.

No, no, no, it's clear you know

I mean, if that's how
you really feel about me,

1:19:16.124 --> 1:19:17.856

1:19:19.293 --> 1:19:21.253
No, no, please, Maestro.
Please forgive me.

1:19:21.388 --> 1:19:22.822

1:19:22.958 --> 1:19:26.196
Your obsequiousness,
your hypocrisy, your misogamy?

1:19:26.332 --> 1:19:29.438
-I'm not a misogynist!
-Misogamy.

1:19:29.574 --> 1:19:31.973
It's a hatred of marriage.

1:19:33.635 --> 1:19:36.507
Andris is still
very much married.

1:19:37.677 --> 1:19:42.510

on the same floor, don't you?

1:19:42.646 --> 1:19:46.045
I just don't like
what he's implying.

1:19:46.915 --> 1:19:50.015
It could lead to more than
Chinese whispers.

1:19:50.151 --> 1:19:51.627
I know.

1:19:51.762 --> 1:19:53.124
We barely survived<i> Der Spiegel</i>

1:19:53.260 --> 1:19:55.524
when you and I
came out together.

1:19:57.101 --> 1:20:01.365
But with Francesca, no one
could point their finger.

1:20:01.501 --> 1:20:03.867
It's not like you two are
in a relationship.

1:20:04.002 --> 1:20:05.467
Yeah, that's true.

1:20:05.602 --> 1:20:07.800
I just...
Turns my stomach to think

1:20:07.936 --> 1:20:10.539
the old robot will be right
about something.

1:20:12.182 --> 1:20:16.083
He's probably already run
to Andris. (scoffs)

1:20:16.218 --> 1:20:19.654
Well, is there someone
other than Francesca

1:20:19.789 --> 1:20:22.056
you feel is more qualified?

1:20:24.862 --> 1:20:27.358
There are others
equal to the task.

1:20:30.092 --> 1:20:31.896
Hmm?

1:20:32.031 --> 1:20:34.299
Maybe wait to decide.

1:20:43.548 --> 1:20:45.181
Where are we at with DG?

1:20:45.316 --> 1:20:48.841
-Uh, I spoke to an assistant
in Boyd Muir's office... -Hmm.

1:20:48.976 --> 1:20:51.447
... who said they weren't sure
why they decided

1:20:51.583 --> 1:20:55.252
on a digital-only set,
what the criteria were.

1:20:55.388 --> 1:20:57.122
-(sighs)
-But I do know they just did

1:20:57.258 --> 1:20:58.790
a full-vinyl pressing
for Long Yu.

1:20:58.926 --> 1:21:00.596
Of course they did.

1:21:00.731 --> 1:21:02.828
The Chinese market's incredible.

1:21:02.963 --> 1:21:04.831
All right. Gloves off.

1:21:04.967 --> 1:21:06.426
I'm going straight to Lucian.

1:21:06.561 --> 1:21:07.760
Maybe he needs to be reminded of

1:21:07.895 --> 1:21:09.536
his Annenberg
Inclusion Initiative.

1:21:09.671 --> 1:21:11.137
(chuckles)

1:21:11.273 --> 1:21:12.764
You've got
his contact details, right?

1:21:12.900 --> 1:21:16.077
Mm-hmm.
I'll send it to you right now.

1:21:17.146 --> 1:21:21.144
(groans)
My machine's misbehaving again.

1:21:21.279 --> 1:21:23.113
I've already spoken to I.T.

1:21:23.248 --> 1:21:25.515
Just here-- let me borrow yours.

1:21:32.661 --> 1:21:34.458
Thank you.

1:21:37.602 --> 1:21:39.331
Where's the matcha?

1:21:46.775 --> 1:21:48.604
(door closes)

1:21:58.854 --> 1:22:01.122
(Tár exhales softly)

1:22:13.328 --> 1:22:15.400
(grunting)

1:22:23.904 --> 1:22:25.745
Ah, I wasn't sure
where you were.

1:22:25.881 --> 1:22:27.511
Was working out a kink.

1:22:27.646 --> 1:22:29.950
The-the matcha's cold.
I-I'll get another.

1:22:30.086 --> 1:22:31.377
It's all right.
I don't need it.

1:22:31.513 --> 1:22:33.583
Let's just keep working.

1:22:35.022 --> 1:22:37.092
(Tár clears throat)

1:22:40.931 --> 1:22:43.022
Francesca, you did as I asked

1:22:43.157 --> 1:22:46.697
and deleted any and all
correspondence with Krista,

1:22:46.833 --> 1:22:48.499
correct?

1:22:50.102 --> 1:22:53.207
Um, I'm not sure.

1:22:54.174 --> 1:22:55.775
Uh, I'm-I'm... I'm not sure.

1:22:55.911 --> 1:22:58.212
I-I'll double-check.

1:23:05.220 --> 1:23:08.086
You know,
Sebastian's leaving us,

1:23:08.221 --> 1:23:09.882
and I wondered if you might, uh,

1:23:10.017 --> 1:23:14.030
compile a list
of suitable replacements.

1:23:18.598 --> 1:23:22.038
Uh, of course, feel free
to add your own name.

1:23:25.076 --> 1:23:27.439
-Thank you.
-(cell phone vibrates)

1:23:28.707 --> 1:23:32.578
Oh, your-your lunch
with the new cellist.

1:23:32.714 --> 1:23:33.839
Oh.

1:23:33.974 --> 1:23:35.114
Meant to have you
reschedule that

1:23:35.249 --> 1:23:36.915
'til after the orchestra votes.

1:23:37.050 --> 1:23:39.154
I'll text her now.

1:23:40.922 --> 1:23:43.024
No, wait. (scoffs)

1:23:43.160 --> 1:23:45.857
Might as well
see what she's made of.

1:23:45.993 --> 1:23:47.723
(Tár sniffles)

1:23:49.900 --> 1:23:52.167
(dishes clinking quietly)

1:23:54.266 --> 1:23:56.501
This food. (chuckles)

1:23:58.109 --> 1:24:02.134
The cucumber salad's,
uh, very good.

1:24:02.269 --> 1:24:04.141
It's kind of the only
real option in this place

1:24:04.276 --> 1:24:05.779
if you're vegetarian.

1:24:05.915 --> 1:24:07.615
Uh, do you eat fish?

1:24:07.750 --> 1:24:09.580
Not really.

1:24:12.255 --> 1:24:15.614
You know, we can go
somewhere else.

1:24:15.750 --> 1:24:17.283
L-Like the Store Kitchen.

1:24:17.418 --> 1:24:20.786
I mean, it's... uh, it's kind
of a silly tradition really

1:24:20.921 --> 1:24:22.855
that new members
are brought here

1:24:22.991 --> 1:24:25.796
to sup with the ghosts
of the past.

1:24:25.931 --> 1:24:28.832
I mean, at some point,
everyone from... from Napoleon

1:24:28.968 --> 1:24:32.873
to Beethoven tucked in for
a meal at one of these tables.

1:24:33.008 --> 1:24:35.204
Yes, and Clara Zetkin.

1:24:35.340 --> 1:24:36.902
I wonder which one.

1:24:37.038 --> 1:24:39.747
Who's that?
It's a, uh, musician?

1:24:39.883 --> 1:24:41.547
No. She helped found

1:24:41.682 --> 1:24:44.547
Social Democratic
women's movement in Germany

1:24:44.683 --> 1:24:48.023
and KPD until
Hitler came to power

1:24:48.158 --> 1:24:50.856
and she was exiled
to Soviet Union.

1:24:50.992 --> 1:24:52.350
Clara Zetkin?

1:24:52.486 --> 1:24:53.691
Yes.

1:24:53.826 --> 1:24:56.161
Every March 8th, we place
flowers at her plaque

1:24:56.296 --> 1:24:58.831
in Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

1:24:58.967 --> 1:25:00.264
Her birthday?

1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:02.604
No, International Women's Day.

1:25:02.739 --> 1:25:04.635
(Olga chuckles)

1:25:06.034 --> 1:25:08.408
-Are you ready, Maestro?
-(pen clicks)

1:25:08.544 --> 1:25:12.874
-Yes, uh... -Yes,
first shashlik, then veal.

1:25:13.908 --> 1:25:16.215
-For you?
-Cucumber salad.

1:25:16.350 --> 1:25:17.714
-Thank you.
-Good choice.

1:25:20.988 --> 1:25:22.919
Some more bread?

1:25:23.055 --> 1:25:24.853
Hmm.

1:25:30.091 --> 1:25:31.697
It's good.
Would you like a bite?

1:25:31.833 --> 1:25:33.558
Oh, no.

1:25:33.694 --> 1:25:35.501
No. Thank you.

1:25:36.502 --> 1:25:38.200
Have you lived in Berlin long?

1:25:38.335 --> 1:25:40.106
No, not at all.

1:25:40.241 --> 1:25:41.639
I have friends in Wicker I visit

1:25:41.774 --> 1:25:44.378
-until I know decision
of orchestra. -Hmm.

1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:47.048
Simonov will hold your place?

1:25:47.184 --> 1:25:50.186
Yes, I think so.
He is my uncle.

1:25:51.512 --> 1:25:52.717
Oh.

1:25:52.852 --> 1:25:55.547
But my dream has always been
to play with Berlin.

1:25:55.682 --> 1:25:57.583
Oh, me, too.

1:25:57.719 --> 1:25:59.789
There's nowhere like it.

1:26:03.467 --> 1:26:07.203
I imagine, uh, Rostropovich
is a hero of yours.

1:26:08.204 --> 1:26:10.303
Well, of course, he was great.

1:26:10.439 --> 1:26:12.473
We study him
at Moscow Conservatory,

1:26:12.609 --> 1:26:16.770
but growing up, my favorite
is Jacqueline du Pré.

1:26:16.905 --> 1:26:19.308
She made me want to play cello.

1:26:19.444 --> 1:26:20.848
Which record was it?

1:26:20.984 --> 1:26:23.575
Not record. YouTube.

1:26:23.710 --> 1:26:25.551
Elgar Concerto.

1:26:27.286 --> 1:26:28.488
Oh, of course.

1:26:28.623 --> 1:26:31.190
With Barenboim conducting
the London Phil.

1:26:31.325 --> 1:26:34.127
I don't know who was conducting.

1:26:34.262 --> 1:26:37.088
But she did something to me.

1:26:37.224 --> 1:26:38.925
That's when I decide
to learn piece

1:26:39.061 --> 1:26:41.433
and play it
with youth orchestra.

1:26:41.569 --> 1:26:43.529
Quite a challenge.
How old were you?

1:26:43.664 --> 1:26:45.406
Thirteen.

1:26:46.809 --> 1:26:48.271
Wow.

1:26:48.407 --> 1:26:50.212
I'd love to hear it.

1:26:50.347 --> 1:26:53.249
They make video.
I will text to you.

1:26:55.114 --> 1:26:58.584

Concerto in E minor, Op. 85)

1:30:06.439 --> 1:30:09.038
(speaking German)

1:30:12.778 --> 1:30:15.645
Now, um, just before we break,

1:30:15.780 --> 1:30:17.714
I know many of you are wondering

1:30:17.849 --> 1:30:20.720
what the companion piece
will be.

1:30:20.855 --> 1:30:23.349
And I have been
thinking quite a bit about it

1:30:23.484 --> 1:30:25.318
and was wondering
if we could just take

1:30:25.454 --> 1:30:28.988
an informal poll about
possibly pairing the Five

1:30:29.123 --> 1:30:31.995
with Elgar's Cello Concerto.

1:30:54.222 --> 1:30:56.988
(speaks German)

1:30:57.991 --> 1:31:02.462
Oh, and, uh, given what
we've all been through,

1:31:02.597 --> 1:31:04.193
what we're still going through,

1:31:04.329 --> 1:31:08.867
and we're finally back
together as a family, I-I...

1:31:10.034 --> 1:31:11.935
... I feel that
maybe the soloist

1:31:12.071 --> 1:31:14.706
should come from
within our own ranks.

1:31:14.841 --> 1:31:16.109
-(excited chatter)
-MAN: Yeah.

1:31:16.245 --> 1:31:17.543
(bows tapping)

1:31:17.678 --> 1:31:18.976
TÁR:
Good. Okay, good.

1:31:19.112 --> 1:31:21.780
Just... Sorry. (chuckles)
One more question.

1:31:21.916 --> 1:31:24.085
And this really is
just for you, Gosia.

1:31:24.220 --> 1:31:25.719
I mean... (sighs)

1:31:25.855 --> 1:31:28.453
... as a practical matter,
I mean, this would

1:31:28.588 --> 1:31:30.617
normally fall to you.

1:31:30.753 --> 1:31:33.395
But given how much is gonna be
asked of you with the Mahler,

1:31:33.531 --> 1:31:35.263
I-I wondered if you'd be
at all bothered

1:31:35.399 --> 1:31:38.028
if we were to hold auditions?

1:31:46.809 --> 1:31:50.271
(chuckling):
Well, that's a bit unorthodox.

1:31:53.375 --> 1:31:56.341
But, in theory,
I have no objection.

1:31:56.477 --> 1:31:57.816
My only hesitation
will depend on

1:31:57.952 --> 1:31:59.420
when these auditions
might take place.

1:31:59.555 --> 1:32:00.917
I wouldn't want them in any way

1:32:01.052 --> 1:32:02.314
to interfere with
our sectionals.

1:32:02.450 --> 1:32:04.087
No, no, no.
That's a good point.

1:32:04.222 --> 1:32:05.756
I mean, it is gonna
have to be a... (laughs)

1:32:05.891 --> 1:32:07.291
It's gonna have to be a sprint.

1:32:07.426 --> 1:32:09.059
Um...

1:32:10.497 --> 1:32:12.260
How about Monday?

1:32:16.304 --> 1:32:17.969
All right.

1:32:21.235 --> 1:32:22.468
TÁR:
Okay, good.

1:32:22.603 --> 1:32:25.607
Knut, would you assemble
a quorum for Monday?

1:32:25.742 --> 1:32:27.110
(speaks quietly)

1:32:31.452 --> 1:32:34.249
(quiet murmuring)

WOMAN:
Let me see what she says.

1:32:42.926 --> 1:32:44.831
Okay, I got, I gotta go.

1:32:46.092 --> 1:32:47.793
Britta, hi.

1:32:47.928 --> 1:32:48.799
Lydia.

1:32:48.934 --> 1:32:50.629
-Just caught the end.
-Ah!

1:32:50.764 --> 1:32:52.536
What'd you think? How's it, uh,
how's it sounding?

1:32:52.672 --> 1:32:54.840
Oh, it's fantastic.

1:32:54.976 --> 1:32:57.169
I can't wait
until the live recording.

1:32:57.305 --> 1:32:58.841
-Yes, well.
-(kissing)

1:32:58.977 --> 1:33:01.414
I'll be happy when it's over.

1:33:01.549 --> 1:33:03.181
It's always that way.

1:33:03.317 --> 1:33:06.515
I know you're busy, and I don't
want to add to your load,

1:33:06.650 --> 1:33:08.585
but...

1:33:08.721 --> 1:33:10.823
Andris Davis called.

1:33:10.958 --> 1:33:14.162
Look, he's upset
I'm rotating Sebastian.

1:33:14.298 --> 1:33:15.492
No, no, no, no, no.

1:33:15.627 --> 1:33:16.828
Something else.

1:33:16.963 --> 1:33:18.193
But you will please
let Laura know

1:33:18.329 --> 1:33:19.600
as soon as you have chosen
his replacement

1:33:19.735 --> 1:33:21.036
so she can prepare
a press release.

1:33:21.171 --> 1:33:22.401
Yeah, of course.

1:33:22.537 --> 1:33:24.201
Uh, so what did he want?

1:33:24.336 --> 1:33:26.665
To complain about
the punctuality of a driver

1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:29.575
he seems to believe
the board supplies him with.

1:33:29.710 --> 1:33:31.737
Do you know anything about this?

1:33:31.873 --> 1:33:33.045
Yes.

1:33:33.180 --> 1:33:36.045
No, it's just... it's just
something I pay for.

1:33:36.181 --> 1:33:38.750
Then why does he believe
it's the board?

1:33:38.885 --> 1:33:42.113
Because he needs
to believe that.

1:33:42.248 --> 1:33:43.924
H-He needs to b...

1:33:44.059 --> 1:33:46.519
needs to believe he hasn't
been forgotten, Britta.

1:33:46.654 --> 1:33:49.227
Uh, the academy
has von Karajan's name on it,

1:33:49.363 --> 1:33:51.856
and there are love shrines
to Abbado all over this place.

1:33:51.992 --> 1:33:56.269
But the name of Davis, it's
essentially nowhere to be seen.

1:33:56.404 --> 1:33:57.895
All right.

1:33:58.031 --> 1:34:01.406
Then perhaps Francesca could
have a word with the driver.

1:34:01.541 --> 1:34:03.705
Of course.

1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:05.707
One other thing.

1:34:05.842 --> 1:34:07.544
It's unpleasant.

1:34:07.679 --> 1:34:09.075
Oh, is it?

1:34:09.210 --> 1:34:10.983
Operational shortfall?

1:34:11.118 --> 1:34:13.580
Must I take Mrs. Sewing
out to drinks again?

1:34:13.715 --> 1:34:15.581
No, no, no, nothing to do
with the orchestra.

1:34:15.716 --> 1:34:17.753
Do you remember
an Accordion Academy fellow

1:34:17.889 --> 1:34:20.388
named Krista Taylor?

1:34:23.530 --> 1:34:25.600
Yes. Why?

1:34:25.736 --> 1:34:28.236
Apparently,
she committed suicide.

1:34:28.372 --> 1:34:31.404
Oh, God. Poor thing.

1:34:31.539 --> 1:34:33.469
Her parents mu...

1:34:34.405 --> 1:34:37.007
Wait, sorry,
I'm... I'm confused, Britta.

1:34:37.143 --> 1:34:39.414
Why, why were you put
in the position

1:34:39.550 --> 1:34:40.749
to deliver this terrible news?

1:34:40.884 --> 1:34:42.812
Why didn't Accordion
contact me directly?

1:34:42.947 --> 1:34:44.817
It's delicate, Lydia.

1:34:44.952 --> 1:34:46.420
Mr. Kaplan thought
it might be best

1:34:46.556 --> 1:34:47.822
if you contacted a lawyer

1:34:47.957 --> 1:34:50.419
before speaking with anyone
at Accordion.

1:34:50.555 --> 1:34:53.927
Well, presumably, that anyone
includes Eliot himself.

1:34:55.933 --> 1:34:59.163
I'm, I'm sorry, why-why
would I need to do that?

1:34:59.298 --> 1:35:03.739
Apparently, some accusations
have been made.

1:35:05.304 --> 1:35:07.274
Accusations?
What kind of accusations?

1:35:07.410 --> 1:35:08.876
He didn't say.

1:35:09.011 --> 1:35:11.275
But they were brought
to Accordion's counsel.

1:35:11.410 --> 1:35:14.339
Mr. Kaplan said he's certain
nothing will come of it,

1:35:14.475 --> 1:35:17.082
but one can't be too careful.

1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:26.762
(sighs heavily)

1:35:31.597 --> 1:35:33.197
(sniffs)

1:35:35.599 --> 1:35:38.037
I'm sorry about the hour.
It's Lydia Tár calling.

1:35:38.172 --> 1:35:41.306
I need to speak to Mr. Singer
immediately.

1:35:41.442 --> 1:35:42.706
Yes.

1:35:42.841 --> 1:35:44.813
Yes, it's urgent.

1:36:08.803 --> 1:36:11.037
(low, quiet conversations)

1:36:13.804 --> 1:36:15.844
Tired?

1:36:18.876 --> 1:36:21.345
Sleep's elusive.

1:36:22.248 --> 1:36:24.820
I was the same
before a recording date.

1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:28.186
Lydia...

1:36:28.321 --> 1:36:31.920
are-are you absolutely
certain about Sebastian?

1:36:32.056 --> 1:36:34.386
TÁR:
Mm-hmm.

1:36:34.522 --> 1:36:37.223
Who will you replace him with?

1:36:37.358 --> 1:36:39.595
Possibly Andrew Crust.

1:36:40.498 --> 1:36:43.766
He's been assisting
Otto Tausk at the VSO.

1:36:43.902 --> 1:36:46.369
Not the girl?

1:36:51.678 --> 1:36:53.915
(Tár sighs)

1:36:55.176 --> 1:36:57.281
Andris...

1:37:00.515 --> 1:37:03.218
... have you ever had an issue

1:37:03.353 --> 1:37:05.918
with a, a student or colleague,

1:37:06.054 --> 1:37:08.060
where that person may have
misinterpreted your intention?

1:37:08.196 --> 1:37:09.591
Has someone been complaining
about me?

1:37:09.726 --> 1:37:11.665
-No, no, no, of course not.
-Because at this point,

1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:13.232
they've missed their chance.

1:37:13.367 --> 1:37:15.435
-I'm out of the game.
-Yes, yes, I know, I know.

1:37:15.570 --> 1:37:16.828
Course you are.

1:37:16.963 --> 1:37:18.769
Thank God I was never pulled
from the podium

1:37:18.904 --> 1:37:20.841
like Jimmy Levine.

1:37:20.977 --> 1:37:24.735
Or-or hunted
like Charles Dutoit.

1:37:24.871 --> 1:37:27.279
I take it you're asking
for a reason.

1:37:27.415 --> 1:37:30.275
Well, there's just been
so much of this sort of thing

1:37:30.411 --> 1:37:31.945
in the news lately.

1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:35.386
Well, nowadays, to be accused
is the same as being guilty.

1:37:36.322 --> 1:37:37.849
But I suppose
that was also the case

1:37:37.984 --> 1:37:40.956
all those years ago
with Furtwängler.

1:37:41.092 --> 1:37:44.229
A bit with Karajan, too.

1:37:46.836 --> 1:37:49.500
Who was the better conductor?

1:37:50.336 --> 1:37:52.799
I never played
under Furtwängler.

1:37:52.934 --> 1:37:55.170
Yeah, when I first arrived here,
the older members

1:37:55.306 --> 1:37:58.476
had, uh, hmm, hushed opinions.

1:37:58.612 --> 1:38:01.943
At the same time, they wanted
to leave that era behind.

1:38:02.079 --> 1:38:03.474
What, the war?

1:38:03.610 --> 1:38:04.781
-No, postwar.
-Ah.

1:38:04.916 --> 1:38:07.050
Denazification.

1:38:07.185 --> 1:38:08.789
Someone pointed a finger at you,

1:38:08.924 --> 1:38:10.858
process started all over again.

1:38:10.994 --> 1:38:13.561
Furtwängler never joined
the Party.

1:38:13.697 --> 1:38:14.962
Refused to give the salute

1:38:15.098 --> 1:38:17.128
or to conduct the
"Horst-Wessel-Lied."

1:38:17.264 --> 1:38:19.964
Or to sign his letters,
"Heil, Hitler."

1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:23.002
Even those he wrote to Hitler.

1:38:23.138 --> 1:38:27.676
But he was obliged
to be denazified.

1:38:27.811 --> 1:38:30.477
Until then, he was semiretired,

1:38:30.612 --> 1:38:33.146
playing corpses.

1:38:33.945 --> 1:38:35.982
Playing corpses?

1:38:36.118 --> 1:38:39.449
Secretly performing
in a graveyard.

1:38:40.981 --> 1:38:43.152
You're not equating
sexual impropriety

1:38:43.287 --> 1:38:45.554
with being an accused Nazi?

1:38:46.620 --> 1:38:48.162
Either way, you had to be ready.

1:38:48.298 --> 1:38:50.930
For years, I made sure
all the hangers in my closet

1:38:51.065 --> 1:38:53.298
were facing the same direction.

1:39:03.837 --> 1:39:06.707
How many are auditioning
on Monday?

1:39:10.981 --> 1:39:12.515
No one.

1:39:13.489 --> 1:39:15.155
No one?

1:39:16.659 --> 1:39:19.025
Maybe Martin.

1:39:19.161 --> 1:39:20.886
He's never gotten along
with Gosia.

1:39:21.021 --> 1:39:23.658
He would love to sit downstage
for once.

1:39:25.325 --> 1:39:27.726
Well...

1:39:27.862 --> 1:39:30.170
he's still gonna
have to audition.

1:39:31.904 --> 1:39:33.806
Of course.

1:39:33.942 --> 1:39:36.176
Have to follow the rules.

1:39:38.006 --> 1:39:40.379
TÁR: Aren't we being
a bit formal, Francesca?

1:39:40.514 --> 1:39:43.050
From what I understand,
there's only one player, right?

1:39:43.186 --> 1:39:46.087
FRANCESCA:
No, Maestro, there are two.

1:39:47.456 --> 1:39:50.685
(cello and piano playing
dramatic classical music)

1:40:08.808 --> 1:40:12.278
(cello playing Elgar's Cello
Concerto in E minor, Op. 85)

1:40:41.339 --> 1:40:43.804
(cello holding final note)

1:40:48.281 --> 1:40:50.149
SHARON:
Well, it's unanimous.

1:40:50.284 --> 1:40:52.852
-Number two.
-TÁR: Mm-hmm.

1:40:52.987 --> 1:40:54.285
And we have a problem.

1:40:54.421 --> 1:40:55.781
She's not officially
been invited

1:40:55.917 --> 1:40:58.093
to become a member
of the orchestra.

1:40:59.262 --> 1:41:02.559
Well, she wouldn't need to be
to solo for us.

1:41:02.694 --> 1:41:04.797
KNUT: I believe the criteria
of the audition

1:41:04.933 --> 1:41:07.325
was all section members?

1:41:07.460 --> 1:41:09.665
-(grunts) Then her audition
gets thrown out. -SHARON: No.

1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:12.169
Francesca, please ask Martin
to come back in

1:41:12.304 --> 1:41:14.499
so we can give him the news.

1:41:14.635 --> 1:41:16.639
Wait. Gosia, let's talk.

1:41:19.011 --> 1:41:21.473
Shit! (laughing)

1:41:21.608 --> 1:41:22.678
(whooping loudly)

1:41:22.813 --> 1:41:25.219
Yeah! (continues laughing
and whooping)

1:41:26.553 --> 1:41:29.920
I'll confirm solo rehearsal
dates with her.

1:41:30.055 --> 1:41:31.889
Thank you.

1:41:32.024 --> 1:41:34.228
Have a seat.

1:41:38.463 --> 1:41:40.397
(sighs):
I have made a decision

1:41:40.533 --> 1:41:43.336
regarding Sebastian's
replacement.

1:41:44.473 --> 1:41:48.209
And I want you to know
it wasn't an easy one.

1:41:49.544 --> 1:41:53.876
Uh, this position brings with it
enormous responsibility,

1:41:54.011 --> 1:41:57.341
-and my personal affection
for you aside... -(scoffs)

1:41:57.477 --> 1:42:02.355
... I will have to go with
someone more, more experienced.

1:42:17.402 --> 1:42:19.669
(quiet high-pitched tone)

1:42:25.077 --> 1:42:26.742
(tone stops)

1:42:42.525 --> 1:42:44.760
(playing simple melody)

1:42:52.866 --> 1:42:54.902
(bell chiming in distance)

1:42:59.139 --> 1:43:02.013
-(knocking on door)
-(plays note)

1:43:02.149 --> 1:43:04.081
Oh, leave me alone.

1:43:04.217 --> 1:43:06.584
I don't have your paper.

1:43:07.452 --> 1:43:09.286
I've told you before, I...

1:43:09.422 --> 1:43:11.622
Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.

1:43:16.556 --> 1:43:17.864
(sighs)

1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:20.235
(playing gentle melody)

1:43:57.631 --> 1:43:58.835
Good. Good.

1:43:58.970 --> 1:44:01.900
I-I think the contrast is,
it's much better now.

1:44:02.035 --> 1:44:03.408
-Don't you think?
-Hmm.

1:44:03.544 --> 1:44:05.306
(sighs)
How do you take your coffee?

1:44:05.442 --> 1:44:07.678
Black. Strong.

1:44:09.315 --> 1:44:11.142
Is all right if I play?

1:44:11.277 --> 1:44:13.783
Hmm? Oh, yes,
of course, of course.

1:44:23.967 --> 1:44:25.993
(playing gentle melody)

1:45:02.271 --> 1:45:04.728
That's as far as I've gotten.

1:45:04.864 --> 1:45:06.874
But it's good.

1:45:07.010 --> 1:45:09.575
Um, this part here.

1:45:13.347 --> 1:45:15.713
Maybe change A to B-flat?

1:45:19.422 --> 1:45:21.884
That's better.
I like that sound.

1:45:23.521 --> 1:45:25.760
Come on. Take a break.

1:45:25.895 --> 1:45:27.857
Okay. (chuckles)

I'm hiding from her.

1:46:35.330 --> 1:46:36.696
(whispers):
Why?

1:46:36.831 --> 1:46:39.858
Because she told me
to put my things in order,

1:46:39.993 --> 1:46:42.833
but they already are.

1:46:45.601 --> 1:46:47.805
I can see that.

1:46:48.801 --> 1:46:49.968
Come on.

1:46:50.103 --> 1:46:51.973
They're all waiting for you.

1:46:52.109 --> 1:46:55.347
PETRA: I'm going to give
everyone a pencil.

1:46:55.482 --> 1:46:56.645
TÁR:
All of them?

How long were you acquainted

Oh, I'd have to double-check
with my assistant,

1:48:29.974 --> 1:48:32.776
but cumulatively speaking,
I'd say

1:48:32.912 --> 1:48:35.474
-not more than a few months.
-Hmm.

1:48:35.609 --> 1:48:38.215
-Thank you for your time,
Maestro. -Not at all.

1:48:39.385 --> 1:48:41.612
-This recording will exist on
a protected server... -Mm-hmm.

1:48:41.747 --> 1:48:43.919
... under attorney-client
privilege with Mr. Singer.

1:48:44.055 --> 1:48:45.657
-Great.
-He will follow up with you

1:48:45.793 --> 1:48:47.661
to help prepare
for the deposition.

1:48:50.957 --> 1:48:52.756
Deposition?

1:48:52.892 --> 1:48:54.267
Yes.

1:48:54.403 --> 1:48:56.098
I assumed you were aware.

1:48:56.233 --> 1:48:58.270
Mr. Singer's office said
they'd been coordinating

1:48:58.406 --> 1:49:00.303
with your assistant.

1:49:00.438 --> 1:49:02.834
Francesca, you'd better get
your pretty little ass to work

1:49:02.969 --> 1:49:04.510
right now.

1:49:04.645 --> 1:49:06.043
(man and woman speaking German)

1:49:06.178 --> 1:49:08.046
The only communication
we've received from Francesca

1:49:08.182 --> 1:49:10.341
was an email to my assistant
in the middle of the night

1:49:10.477 --> 1:49:11.814
tendering her immediate
resignation,

1:49:11.949 --> 1:49:13.620
stating she would be in contact

1:49:13.756 --> 1:49:16.113
when she had more details
to provide.

1:49:16.248 --> 1:49:17.620
What kind of details?

1:49:17.756 --> 1:49:19.188
A new address, I suppose.

1:49:19.323 --> 1:49:21.561
In the meantime,
we've been trying all morning

1:49:21.697 --> 1:49:23.296
to find someone suitable
to assist you

1:49:23.431 --> 1:49:24.632
on a temporary basis.

1:49:24.767 --> 1:49:26.463
For now, perhaps
your new assistant conductor

1:49:26.599 --> 1:49:28.033
would be the right fit.

1:49:28.169 --> 1:49:30.534
No. No. He's not available
'til after the live Five date.

1:49:30.670 --> 1:49:32.772
Yes, I'm ready. Let's go.

1:49:36.778 --> 1:49:38.544
I know how much
you depended on her.

1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:40.038
TÁR:
Two-faced little bitch.

1:49:40.173 --> 1:49:41.639
Imagine her hurt, Tár.

1:49:41.775 --> 1:49:44.142
-Don't you dare try to
defend her. -God, slow down!

1:49:44.277 --> 1:49:45.810
She'll come galumphing back.

1:49:45.945 --> 1:49:47.822
-I mean, I've got a dumb phone
like every robot. -Tár, s...

1:49:47.957 --> 1:49:50.021
-How hard can it be to text
all day? -(horn blaring)

1:49:50.157 --> 1:49:52.554
-(screams) Slow down!
-(tires screech, horn honks)

1:49:52.690 --> 1:49:55.025
Or let me out!

1:50:04.296 --> 1:50:06.333
(seat belt unfastens)

1:50:12.578 --> 1:50:14.847
(child chattering)

1:50:15.915 --> 1:50:18.147
-Francesca!
-(pounds on door)

1:50:51.183 --> 1:50:53.886
-WOMAN: Fräulein?
-(keys jingling)

1:50:59.558 --> 1:51:01.861
(keys jingling)

1:51:05.534 --> 1:51:07.658
(low, indistinct whispering)

1:51:08.595 --> 1:51:11.970
(indistinct whispering
continues)

1:51:18.875 --> 1:51:21.111
(insects trilling)

1:51:31.484 --> 1:51:32.788
-(banging on door)
-(gasps)

1:51:32.924 --> 1:51:35.224
(bell chiming in distance)

1:51:37.798 --> 1:51:40.966
(frantically speaking German)

1:51:43.403 --> 1:51:44.634
Come.

1:51:44.770 --> 1:51:47.071
(chiming continues)

1:51:56.079 --> 1:51:58.313
(woman whimpering quietly)

1:52:03.789 --> 1:52:06.024
(chiming continues)

1:52:07.926 --> 1:52:10.127
(woman continues whimpering)

1:52:23.544 --> 1:52:25.411
(woman whimpering)

1:52:25.547 --> 1:52:27.815
(chiming continues)

1:52:30.682 --> 1:52:32.347
(Tár grunts)

1:52:35.456 --> 1:52:37.147
(shushing)

1:52:37.282 --> 1:52:38.589
(Tár grunts)

1:52:38.725 --> 1:52:41.328
(chiming continues)

1:52:41.463 --> 1:52:43.490
(speaking German)

1:52:44.696 --> 1:52:47.399
(shushing)

1:52:47.534 --> 1:52:48.829
(chiming stops)

1:52:48.965 --> 1:52:50.270
(door closes)

1:52:50.405 --> 1:52:53.438
(gasping)

1:52:53.573 --> 1:52:55.843
(water running)

1:53:06.818 --> 1:53:08.850
(knocking on door)

1:53:08.985 --> 1:53:11.320
(turns off water)

1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:15.159
(knocking continues)

1:53:17.332 --> 1:53:18.833
(sighs)

1:53:19.731 --> 1:53:20.766
(door opens)

1:53:20.902 --> 1:53:22.534
OLGA:
Sorry I'm late again.

1:53:22.670 --> 1:53:24.766
TÁR:
Oh.

1:53:24.902 --> 1:53:27.171
(door closes)

1:53:29.512 --> 1:53:32.203
D-Do you live here?

1:53:32.338 --> 1:53:34.547
Not normally, no.

1:53:34.683 --> 1:53:36.044
Uh, make yourself at home.

1:53:36.179 --> 1:53:37.483
I'm just gonna put something on.

1:53:37.619 --> 1:53:39.084
Do you have a towel?

1:53:41.185 --> 1:53:43.550
-(quietly): Yes.
-Thank you.

1:53:48.697 --> 1:53:51.426
I got caught in the rain.

1:53:57.362 --> 1:54:00.270
(both chuckling)

1:54:02.573 --> 1:54:05.136
There is small concert
with musician friends.

1:54:05.271 --> 1:54:06.608
You should come.

1:54:07.712 --> 1:54:11.246
TÁR: Thanks, but I-I...
really must get home. (sighs)

1:54:11.381 --> 1:54:14.421
-You have child, yes?
-Mm-hmm.

1:54:14.557 --> 1:54:16.253
I will not do that.

1:54:18.584 --> 1:54:20.389
Pets are better for some people.

1:54:23.227 --> 1:54:25.999
-Oh. (laughs)
-(laughs)

1:54:33.266 --> 1:54:34.364
What... Oh.

1:54:34.499 --> 1:54:35.699
-Sorry.
-Bye.

1:54:35.834 --> 1:54:36.938
-(laughs)
-Oh, yes. Goodbye. Yes.

1:54:37.074 --> 1:54:38.436
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

1:54:38.572 --> 1:54:40.409
-Oh.
-(chuckles) Okay.

1:54:47.346 --> 1:54:49.113
Oh, Olga!

1:54:49.248 --> 1:54:50.353
Olga!

1:54:58.367 --> 1:55:00.165
Olga?

1:55:02.204 --> 1:55:04.433
(woman singing in
foreign language in distance)

1:55:06.771 --> 1:55:08.943
Olga?

1:55:37.230 --> 1:55:38.973
Hello?

1:55:49.474 --> 1:55:50.548
(water dripping)

1:55:50.683 --> 1:55:52.382
Olga?

1:55:54.317 --> 1:55:56.386
(door closes in distance)

1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:12.666
Olga?

1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:16.274
(light footsteps running)

1:56:21.846 --> 1:56:23.210
Olga?

1:56:23.346 --> 1:56:25.547
(light footsteps running)

1:56:29.924 --> 1:56:32.026
(light footsteps running)

1:56:34.024 --> 1:56:37.064
(growling)

1:56:48.038 --> 1:56:50.275
(panting softly)

1:56:55.584 --> 1:56:58.118
(panting)

1:56:58.954 --> 1:57:00.417
-(gasps)
-(sharp thud)

1:57:07.223 --> 1:57:09.063
(Sharon gasps)

1:57:10.756 --> 1:57:12.757
Why didn't you go to the police?

1:57:12.892 --> 1:57:15.729
I fought. He ran.
What's to tell?

1:57:19.398 --> 1:57:20.503
Oh, God.

1:57:20.638 --> 1:57:21.708
I'm gonna get you something
for the pain.

1:57:21.844 --> 1:57:22.776
No, I don't need anything.

1:57:22.911 --> 1:57:24.938
No, I'm gonna get you something.

1:57:25.074 --> 1:57:26.740
(sighs)

1:57:31.114 --> 1:57:32.746
<i> Ja.</i>

1:57:41.420 --> 1:57:43.097
(sighs)

1:57:48.267 --> 1:57:50.764
PETRA (in distance):
Lydia!

1:57:53.432 --> 1:57:54.330
Lydia!

1:57:54.466 --> 1:57:55.642
(gasps)

1:57:55.778 --> 1:57:58.376
(breathing heavily)

1:58:00.143 --> 1:58:02.116
What is it?

1:58:04.181 --> 1:58:06.285
Hold my foot.

1:58:14.619 --> 1:58:15.989
Is that better?

1:58:16.125 --> 1:58:17.692
Yes.

1:58:23.035 --> 1:58:25.304
(Petra whimpering)

1:58:30.340 --> 1:58:32.806
(instruments warming up)

1:58:51.025 --> 1:58:52.859
-(instruments stop)
-(quiet murmuring)

1:58:59.003 --> 1:59:00.702
Okay.

1:59:00.837 --> 1:59:03.507
Let's, uh, shoo the elephant
from the room.

1:59:04.609 --> 1:59:07.280
"What the hell happened
to her face?"

1:59:07.415 --> 1:59:09.713
"Did she, uh, schedule
a nose and eye job

1:59:09.849 --> 1:59:12.477
and bail before the surgeon
finished the other half?"

1:59:12.612 --> 1:59:13.748
(quiet chuckling)

1:59:17.692 --> 1:59:19.419
No.

1:59:19.555 --> 1:59:21.089
I was, uh, I was attacked.

1:59:21.224 --> 1:59:23.620
Thank you.

1:59:23.755 --> 1:59:25.596
I'm fine. Really.

1:59:25.731 --> 1:59:27.568
-Should've seen the other guy.
-(quiet laughter)

1:59:27.703 --> 1:59:28.592
All right.

1:59:28.727 --> 1:59:30.765
(speaking German)

1:59:34.643 --> 1:59:35.770
(coughs)

1:59:36.944 --> 1:59:38.443
(exhales sharply)

1:59:39.943 --> 1:59:42.942
(orchestra begins playing
light classical music)

1:59:58.763 --> 2:00:00.564
-(grunts)
-(orchestra plays deep note)

2:00:02.068 --> 2:00:03.136
(grunts fiercely)

2:00:03.271 --> 2:00:05.800
(orchestra playing
dramatic music)

2:00:13.915 --> 2:00:15.440
(gasps) Don't.

2:00:15.575 --> 2:00:17.113
It burns.

2:00:17.249 --> 2:00:19.282
You must see the doctor.

2:00:19.417 --> 2:00:21.185
He's booked 'til next week.

2:00:21.321 --> 2:00:22.519
(scoffs) I'll call them again

2:00:22.655 --> 2:00:24.182
and tell them how much pain
you're in.

2:00:24.317 --> 2:00:26.692
No, no, let's just,
let's just finish up here.

2:00:26.827 --> 2:00:28.293
Okay?

2:00:28.429 --> 2:00:30.326
Overall, the balance
feels right.

2:00:30.461 --> 2:00:31.693
Other than a quick brushup,

2:00:31.828 --> 2:00:34.229
we should concentrate
on the Elgar.

2:00:34.365 --> 2:00:37.033
You're certain of that?

2:00:37.168 --> 2:00:39.472
I think so. Yes.

2:00:39.608 --> 2:00:41.341
TÁR:<i> We're absolutely</i>
<i> rock-solid there,</i>

2:00:41.476 --> 2:00:46.170
but I am going to try
to hold them back here.

2:00:46.305 --> 2:00:47.975
Uh, they're just
getting caught up in the power

2:00:48.110 --> 2:00:51.916
of your, uh, glissando
in there, trying to match it.

2:00:52.051 --> 2:00:55.022
Um, probably...

2:00:55.157 --> 2:00:57.648
Where were you attacked,
Maestro?

2:00:57.784 --> 2:01:00.694
Oh, doesn't matter.

2:01:00.829 --> 2:01:02.324
(chuckles) Here.

2:01:02.459 --> 2:01:05.655
(chuckles) Thank you.

2:01:05.791 --> 2:01:07.228
There you are.

2:01:08.131 --> 2:01:10.398
-When did this fall happen?
-Uh, it's all a blur.

2:01:10.533 --> 2:01:13.204
Three, four days ago.

2:01:13.339 --> 2:01:14.738
It's just my shoulder. Yeah.

2:01:14.873 --> 2:01:18.543
It kind of burns,
like I fell asleep by the pool.

2:01:19.678 --> 2:01:22.840
Okay, you can
put your shirt back on.

2:01:22.975 --> 2:01:24.184
You've damaged some nerves.

2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:25.513
The burning sensation
you're feeling

2:01:25.648 --> 2:01:27.182
is called notalgia paresthetica.

2:01:27.317 --> 2:01:28.415
Nostalgia?

2:01:28.551 --> 2:01:30.752
"Notalgia." No "S."

2:01:30.888 --> 2:01:33.289
-Well, how do we treat it?
-You don't.

2:01:33.425 --> 2:01:34.758
Eventually, it goes away.

2:01:34.894 --> 2:01:38.332
An adjustment might help.
You're somewhat crooked.

2:01:39.329 --> 2:01:40.763
(chuckles)

2:01:43.667 --> 2:01:45.900
(piano playing gentle melody)

2:01:56.017 --> 2:01:58.077
(music stops)

2:02:14.134 --> 2:02:16.370
(phone chimes)

2:02:26.714 --> 2:02:28.578
TÁR (over video):
Oh, well, then you must be

2:02:28.714 --> 2:02:32.111
a Negro product
exploited by the Jews.

2:02:33.580 --> 2:02:36.418
Now let's turn our gaze back
to the piano bench up there

2:02:36.554 --> 2:02:38.788
to a superhot young woman.

2:02:39.890 --> 2:02:41.918
That's-that's...
th-that was very good.

2:02:42.054 --> 2:02:44.089
Now, you could masturbate,

2:02:44.225 --> 2:02:47.830
but what are you
actually doing to me?

2:02:48.563 --> 2:02:50.833
(phone chiming)

2:02:53.439 --> 2:02:54.805
-Britta.
-BRITTA: Hi, hi.

2:02:54.940 --> 2:02:57.671
-Have you seen it?
-Yes, yes. I've just seen it.

2:02:57.807 --> 2:03:00.776
... gathering this afternoon.

2:03:00.911 --> 2:03:02.810
-This afternoon?
-Is that a problem?

2:03:02.946 --> 2:03:05.144
No, just...
No, it's no problem.

2:03:08.087 --> 2:03:09.984
(sighs)

2:03:38.777 --> 2:03:44.314
First of all, that class was
conducted in a tech-free zone.

2:03:44.450 --> 2:03:48.057
And second,
whoever violated that rule

2:03:48.192 --> 2:03:51.428
edited what we've all seen
to create linguistic traps

2:03:51.563 --> 2:03:53.028
to completely redefine my words.

2:03:53.164 --> 2:03:55.326
I mean, look at the
reverse shots on the students.

2:03:55.461 --> 2:03:57.168
There's no way that was done
in real time.

2:03:57.304 --> 2:03:58.600
It's a hatchet job.

2:03:58.735 --> 2:04:00.697
I'm sure that's true, Lydia.

2:04:00.832 --> 2:04:04.511
And were it just this video,
we would not be sitting here.

2:04:04.646 --> 2:04:06.175
Unfortunately,
it's linked to an article in

2:04:06.311 --> 2:04:08.712
the<i> New York Post</i> regarding
Krista Taylor's suicide,

2:04:08.847 --> 2:04:11.614
which alludes to
other Accordion fellows

2:04:11.749 --> 2:04:13.619
they claim to have interviewed.

2:04:13.755 --> 2:04:15.846
Laura, can you tell us
about your conversations?

2:04:15.982 --> 2:04:17.190
We haven't had any.

2:04:17.326 --> 2:04:18.858
Obviously, we gave no response

2:04:18.993 --> 2:04:21.527
-as we first wanted to meet
to discuss strategy. -Mm-hmm.

2:04:21.663 --> 2:04:23.992
-Here's the article.
-Thank you, Laura.

2:04:26.057 --> 2:04:28.260
(reading quietly)

2:04:28.395 --> 2:04:31.637
"Enticed and groomed
multiple young women

2:04:31.772 --> 2:04:34.630
"to engage in sex acts
for professional favors.

2:04:34.766 --> 2:04:37.275
Blocked opportunities
to those who didn't comply."

2:04:37.410 --> 2:04:39.710
This is total fiction.

2:04:39.846 --> 2:04:42.138
And the<i> Post</i> is
a how-de-do scandal rag.

2:04:42.273 --> 2:04:45.013
No serious person reads it.

2:04:47.853 --> 2:04:51.552
And so far as
Krista Taylor goes,

2:04:51.687 --> 2:04:53.049
she was disturbed.

2:04:53.185 --> 2:04:55.159
I mean, she fixated on me.

2:04:55.294 --> 2:04:57.063
In what way?

2:04:57.199 --> 2:04:58.494
She sent me weird gifts.

2:04:58.629 --> 2:05:00.163
She trolled me online.

2:05:00.298 --> 2:05:03.099
-She tried to send me signals.
-Well, what kind of signals?

2:05:03.235 --> 2:05:06.395
She vandalized my Wikipedia
page to say she was my muse.

2:05:06.531 --> 2:05:08.774
I mean,
that's easily checked, right?

2:05:08.909 --> 2:05:12.546
And did you ever report this
or file a complaint?

2:05:14.114 --> 2:05:15.572
No.

2:05:15.708 --> 2:05:18.283
No. And I... Look, I probably,
I probably should have.

2:05:18.419 --> 2:05:20.784
I... I felt sorry for her.

2:05:20.920 --> 2:05:22.512
Is this something
you shared with Sharon?

2:05:22.647 --> 2:05:24.415
No. I didn't want
to burden her with it.

2:05:24.551 --> 2:05:26.424
-Don't you think
you should have? -Yes. Yes.

2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:28.123
Well, what-what do you advise?

2:05:28.258 --> 2:05:30.754
Well, for now, it hasn't gotten
all that much traction.

2:05:30.889 --> 2:05:33.457
None of the trades have linked
to it or called for comment.

2:05:33.592 --> 2:05:35.901
-So I say let's see
what happens. -Mm-hmm.

2:05:37.137 --> 2:05:40.605
We wanted to give you as much
warning as possible, Lydia,

2:05:40.741 --> 2:05:42.674
before this Friday's
donor meeting.

2:05:42.810 --> 2:05:44.609
Well, unfortunately,
I won't be there.

2:05:44.745 --> 2:05:46.941
Well, I very much advise
that you are.

2:05:47.077 --> 2:05:48.776
I have the book launch
in New York

2:05:48.911 --> 2:05:51.618
and apparently a deposition.

2:05:52.853 --> 2:05:55.853
Well, we'll fill you in
upon your return, then.

2:05:58.425 --> 2:06:00.187
Enjoy your weekend.

2:06:02.427 --> 2:06:04.493
Starving.

2:06:04.629 --> 2:06:06.228
Finished my thing today.

2:06:06.363 --> 2:06:09.235
SHARON: Congratulations.
We should go out and celebrate.

2:06:09.370 --> 2:06:11.194
I can't. I gotta pack.

2:06:11.330 --> 2:06:13.101
-Hi!
-PETRA: Hi, Lydia.

2:06:18.511 --> 2:06:20.344
TÁR:
Sharon?

2:06:20.479 --> 2:06:22.582
SHARON:
Yeah?

2:06:22.718 --> 2:06:24.476
TÁR:
You seen my performance score?

2:06:24.611 --> 2:06:26.848
SHARON: No. Why?
Isn't it with the other ones?

2:06:26.983 --> 2:06:28.884
TÁR:
No. No, it's not.

2:06:29.020 --> 2:06:31.724
Are you sure
it's not in my office?

2:06:34.058 --> 2:06:36.828
Yeah, what about
the orchestra library?

2:06:38.458 --> 2:06:40.997
Yeah, can you
check again, please?

2:06:43.735 --> 2:06:46.299
I don't know. Yes, exactly.

2:07:03.315 --> 2:07:05.454
(whispering):
Lydia?

2:07:05.589 --> 2:07:07.883
(Tár sighs)

2:07:08.019 --> 2:07:09.427
Yes?

2:07:09.562 --> 2:07:12.297
When will you be back?

2:07:12.433 --> 2:07:14.596
The day after tomorrow.

2:07:14.731 --> 2:07:16.432
Will you promise?

2:07:16.567 --> 2:07:18.936
Yes, I promise.

2:07:29.342 --> 2:07:31.751
-Good night.
-Good night.

2:07:45.897 --> 2:07:48.167
Thanks.
Do you have any bottles?

2:07:48.302 --> 2:07:49.597
Of course.

2:07:50.600 --> 2:07:52.737
Do you need anything else
before I close the cabin door?

2:07:52.873 --> 2:07:55.940
Uh, yes.
Uh, we're waiting on one more.

2:08:02.541 --> 2:08:03.847
WOMAN:
<i> To all my questions</i>

2:08:03.983 --> 2:08:05.649
pertaining to
your communications

2:08:05.785 --> 2:08:08.421
with Krista Taylor and others,

2:08:08.557 --> 2:08:10.954
your answers have always been

2:08:11.089 --> 2:08:15.894
"I don't know"
or "I don't remember."

2:08:18.063 --> 2:08:19.589
Is there anything
I could show you

2:08:19.725 --> 2:08:22.602
that might help refresh
your recollection?

2:08:22.737 --> 2:08:25.200
Any documents,
such as emails from you

2:08:25.335 --> 2:08:27.798
or your personal assistant,
Miss Lentini,

2:08:27.934 --> 2:08:31.943
that might help you recall
what you did and didn't say?

2:08:39.983 --> 2:08:41.720
I guess you heard by now.

2:08:41.856 --> 2:08:44.791
Bryant Park bumped you
to 53rd Street.

2:08:47.919 --> 2:08:50.962
This is the Kaplan Fund's
prepared statement.

2:08:52.997 --> 2:08:54.525
I'm sorry to say this is likely

2:08:54.660 --> 2:08:56.033
the last time
we'll see each other.

2:08:56.168 --> 2:08:58.461
Well, now I can buy
my own plane tickets.

2:08:58.596 --> 2:08:59.971
And you can bother someone else

2:09:00.106 --> 2:09:03.540
to try and teach you
to crawl to the podium.

2:09:03.676 --> 2:09:05.944
(car horns honking)

2:09:09.616 --> 2:09:11.851
(crowd chanting faintly)

2:09:15.952 --> 2:09:17.819
(chanting continues)

2:09:17.955 --> 2:09:20.156
(car horn blaring outside)

2:09:21.024 --> 2:09:23.392
Is there a back entrance?

2:09:23.527 --> 2:09:27.733
"Indeed, the common metaphors
used to explain music

2:09:27.869 --> 2:09:29.933
"are based on
the idea that music

2:09:30.069 --> 2:09:34.664
"is a language,
albeit a secret one.

2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:39.879
"And in this way,
holy and unknowable.

2:09:41.511 --> 2:09:45.083
"These joyful noises we make
being the closest thing

2:09:45.219 --> 2:09:49.185
"any of us might ever
experience to the divine...

2:09:50.489 --> 2:09:55.488
"... yet something born by
the mere act of moving air.

2:09:57.665 --> 2:10:00.262
No different than birdsong."

2:10:03.228 --> 2:10:05.234
(bell dings)

2:10:09.033 --> 2:10:11.373
So, meet downstairs
in half an hour for dinner?

2:10:11.508 --> 2:10:14.210
Thank you, but I am jet-lagged.
I go to sleep now.

2:10:14.345 --> 2:10:18.412
Yeah, me, too.
I'll... probably do the same.

2:10:37.736 --> 2:10:39.972
(crowd clamoring)

2:10:44.445 --> 2:10:46.473
(phone chiming)

2:10:51.719 --> 2:10:53.986
(phone continues chiming)

2:11:01.385 --> 2:11:03.094
(chiming stops)

2:11:13.100 --> 2:11:15.337
(phone chiming)

2:11:17.107 --> 2:11:18.701
TÁR:
Yes, hello.

2:11:18.837 --> 2:11:21.614
Yes, there's no water
in my room.

2:11:21.750 --> 2:11:23.774
Yes, I've checked the minibar.

2:11:23.910 --> 2:11:26.214
How long would it take
to get a bottle of water?

2:11:26.350 --> 2:11:29.120
Uh, don't worry.
I'll just come down.

2:11:30.449 --> 2:11:31.888
(elevator bell dings)

2:11:32.023 --> 2:11:33.619
OLGA:
Lobby, please.

2:12:00.478 --> 2:12:03.312
(gasps) Oh, Jesus.

2:12:03.448 --> 2:12:05.486
(Tár panting)

2:12:10.465 --> 2:12:12.130
(shudders)

2:12:15.626 --> 2:12:18.136
(sighs) It was Britta.

2:12:18.967 --> 2:12:20.730
Right?

2:12:20.866 --> 2:12:22.700
I mean, that is
how you heard about

2:12:22.835 --> 2:12:25.375
these millennial robots
trading in lies.

2:12:25.510 --> 2:12:28.178
I couldn't care less about
the Juilliard thing.

2:12:28.313 --> 2:12:30.339
TÁR:
Too much time on her hands.

2:12:30.475 --> 2:12:31.714
She's fringe.

2:12:31.849 --> 2:12:34.052
The worst kind.

2:12:34.187 --> 2:12:36.255
Every time
I walk out of this house,

2:12:36.390 --> 2:12:40.016
she's in your ear with intrigue
or she's asking me about

2:12:40.152 --> 2:12:43.293
some other piece of fringe,
like Samantha Hankey.

2:12:43.428 --> 2:12:46.395
God, a nobody
who has nothing better to do

2:12:46.531 --> 2:12:50.867
than drop my name at lunch
and imply things.

2:12:51.002 --> 2:12:52.604
I feel sorry for you.

2:12:52.739 --> 2:12:54.733
(scoffs) Save it.

2:12:55.734 --> 2:12:58.110
I tried calling you last night.

2:13:00.045 --> 2:13:02.714
Did you have fun with her?

2:13:02.849 --> 2:13:05.649
My back is killing me.

2:13:05.784 --> 2:13:07.043
Francesca left,

2:13:07.178 --> 2:13:09.614
and I simply needed someone
to carry my bags.

2:13:09.750 --> 2:13:11.657
I mean, who was I
supposed to ask?

2:13:11.793 --> 2:13:14.726
To go with me? Hmm? Knut?

2:13:14.862 --> 2:13:16.294
(sighs):
Jesus fucking...

2:13:16.430 --> 2:13:18.622
SHARON: There are many things
I accept about you.

2:13:18.757 --> 2:13:20.133
-(Tár scoffs)
-And in the end,

2:13:20.268 --> 2:13:24.060
I'm sure I could get over
something like this.

2:13:24.195 --> 2:13:27.073
But that's not what
we're talking about, is it?

2:13:29.534 --> 2:13:30.835
These accusations

2:13:30.970 --> 2:13:34.113
from the parents of the girl
who suicided?

2:13:39.143 --> 2:13:41.747
You honestly believe
what they're saying?

2:13:45.924 --> 2:13:47.588
They're lies.

2:13:49.328 --> 2:13:51.029
Do you understand
what it was like

2:13:51.165 --> 2:13:53.165
to walk into
my sectional yesterday

2:13:53.300 --> 2:13:56.160
and to see everybody
whispering about me?

2:13:56.295 --> 2:14:00.837
It's got nothing to do with
what they're accusing you of.

2:14:00.973 --> 2:14:02.934
It's a simple matter

2:14:03.069 --> 2:14:06.443
of not warning me
that our family is in danger.

2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:09.447
And what good
would that have done?

2:14:09.583 --> 2:14:12.516
I mean, what could you possibly
do to make things better?

2:14:12.652 --> 2:14:14.851
(sighs)

2:14:14.987 --> 2:14:17.183
Because I deserve that.

2:14:17.319 --> 2:14:19.455
Those are the rules.

2:14:20.424 --> 2:14:22.859
You are to ask
for my fucking counsel,

2:14:22.995 --> 2:14:24.955
the way you always have.

2:14:25.090 --> 2:14:26.794
The way you did
when you first arrived here

2:14:26.930 --> 2:14:29.793
as a guest conductor looking
for a permanent position.

2:14:29.929 --> 2:14:32.204
You asked me
what were the politics,

2:14:32.339 --> 2:14:35.297
what were the moves,
how could we swing it.

2:14:35.433 --> 2:14:36.835
(sighs)

2:14:37.975 --> 2:14:39.641
Of course...

2:14:39.776 --> 2:14:43.176
these conversations
took place in another bed.

2:14:43.312 --> 2:14:46.010
Or rather, the couch

2:14:46.145 --> 2:14:48.478
of that horrible place
you still can't let go of.

2:14:48.614 --> 2:14:51.289
Old sorrow blows in.

2:14:52.825 --> 2:14:57.295
How cruel of you to define our
relationship as transactional.

2:14:58.489 --> 2:15:00.323
(sighs)

2:15:00.458 --> 2:15:04.500
There's only one relationship
you've ever had that wasn't.

2:15:04.635 --> 2:15:07.570
And she is sleeping
in the room next door.

2:15:07.705 --> 2:15:10.803
Apparently, this hasn't even
crossed your mind.

2:15:31.866 --> 2:15:34.662
(electronic beeping)

2:15:38.332 --> 2:15:40.536
(quiet chatter)

2:15:48.012 --> 2:15:49.743
(chatter stops)

2:15:54.516 --> 2:15:57.355
(woman laughs in distance)

2:16:12.201 --> 2:16:15.241
(panting)

2:16:16.042 --> 2:16:18.277
(meditative breaths)

2:16:39.634 --> 2:16:41.195
(gasps)

2:16:41.330 --> 2:16:43.236
(exhales sharply)

2:16:44.101 --> 2:16:46.404
(grunting)

2:17:00.315 --> 2:17:02.585
(train rumbling)

2:17:21.999 --> 2:17:23.238
(kids chattering playfully)

2:17:23.373 --> 2:17:25.476
TÁR:
Petra!

2:17:28.048 --> 2:17:29.711
Come here, darling.

2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:33.317
-It was good.
-Was it?

2:17:33.453 --> 2:17:35.784
-Yeah.
-You want to go to the park?

2:17:36.654 --> 2:17:38.757
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

2:17:38.893 --> 2:17:40.491
Please don't.

2:17:45.965 --> 2:17:47.960
(panting softly)

2:17:55.739 --> 2:17:58.575
(inhales deeply,
whispers indistinctly)

2:18:02.239 --> 2:18:03.745
-(loud knock on door)
-(gasps)

2:18:06.516 --> 2:18:09.012
Hello. I am Anna Franzen.

2:18:09.148 --> 2:18:11.984
This is
my late mother's apartment.

2:18:13.417 --> 2:18:16.795
Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry
about your mother.

2:18:16.930 --> 2:18:19.029
Thank you.

2:18:19.165 --> 2:18:21.192
How's your sister doing?

2:18:21.327 --> 2:18:24.398
Eleanor lives now
in a facility in Neukölln.

2:18:24.534 --> 2:18:26.229
I'm sorry to trouble you,

2:18:26.364 --> 2:18:29.538
but my husband and I
are selling the place

2:18:29.674 --> 2:18:33.777
and couldn't help
hearing the music.

2:18:33.913 --> 2:18:35.038
Oh.

2:18:35.173 --> 2:18:36.545
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
(sniffles)

2:18:36.681 --> 2:18:38.248
MAN:
We were wondering if there are

2:18:38.383 --> 2:18:40.210
specific hours you rehearse,

2:18:40.345 --> 2:18:43.016
so we can schedule showings
around them.

2:18:44.052 --> 2:18:46.892
We don't want to scare
potential buyers off

2:18:47.028 --> 2:18:49.390
with all the noise.

2:18:49.525 --> 2:18:51.993
(laughs):
Oh, no.

2:18:52.129 --> 2:18:53.128
No.

2:18:53.263 --> 2:18:55.231
(laughing)

2:18:55.367 --> 2:18:57.264
No, we wouldn't want that.

2:18:57.399 --> 2:18:59.064
(laughing)

2:19:00.039 --> 2:19:02.100

(applause)

2:20:35.126 --> 2:20:37.195
(applause continues in distance)

2:20:40.304 --> 2:20:42.536
(applause fades)

2:20:42.671 --> 2:20:44.972
(Tár breathes sharply)

2:20:47.677 --> 2:20:49.911
(playing slow classical fanfare)

2:21:11.271 --> 2:21:13.539
(orchestra joins in)

2:21:22.841 --> 2:21:24.981
(grunting)

2:21:25.117 --> 2:21:26.780
(yells)

2:21:26.916 --> 2:21:28.316
-(crowd gasps)
-(music stops)

2:21:28.452 --> 2:21:30.823
(Tár panting)

2:21:30.958 --> 2:21:31.881
Okay.

2:21:32.016 --> 2:21:33.421
(speaking German)

2:21:33.556 --> 2:21:34.983
Give me some eyes.

2:21:35.118 --> 2:21:36.595
(crowd murmuring)

2:21:39.964 --> 2:21:41.798
-Come on, give me some eyes!
-(clapping)

2:21:45.965 --> 2:21:47.705
ELIOT:
Lydia.

2:21:48.538 --> 2:21:51.267
This is my score.

2:21:51.402 --> 2:21:53.612
-Lydia, you're confused.
-(grunts)

2:21:53.747 --> 2:21:55.580
-It's my score!
-(crowd gasping, murmuring)

2:21:55.716 --> 2:21:59.112
-You fucking little nothing!
-(grunts)

2:22:02.046 --> 2:22:03.417
(Eliot grunts)

2:22:03.552 --> 2:22:05.789
(panting)

2:22:07.394 --> 2:22:08.425
TÁR:
I'm fine.

2:22:08.560 --> 2:22:10.794
(crowd continues murmuring)

2:22:11.627 --> 2:22:14.160
(Tár panting)

2:22:38.085 --> 2:22:40.691
DRIVER:
You sign CAMI voucher.

2:22:40.827 --> 2:22:43.090
(driver speaking into phone
in Tamil)

2:22:51.969 --> 2:22:54.266
(pile driver rattling
and thumping)

2:23:01.514 --> 2:23:02.546
(phone rings in distance)

2:23:02.681 --> 2:23:05.147
MAN:
Good afternoon. CAMI.

2:23:05.283 --> 2:23:06.851
Hold on.

2:23:07.787 --> 2:23:09.316
CORY:
Normally, I'd think Lisa Rich

2:23:09.452 --> 2:23:11.921
in our booking department
would be a great fit for you,

2:23:12.056 --> 2:23:14.350
but she's just got
too much on her plate.

2:23:14.486 --> 2:23:17.828
So, I'd like to team you
with Jake here.

2:23:17.963 --> 2:23:20.365
Jake, you want to,
you want to show Lydia

2:23:20.501 --> 2:23:21.999
what you've prepared for her?

2:23:22.135 --> 2:23:24.334
Well...

2:23:24.470 --> 2:23:26.770
right now it's a reset.

2:23:26.905 --> 2:23:28.536
What we're after is less,
not more.

2:23:28.672 --> 2:23:29.773
We want to be selective

2:23:29.908 --> 2:23:31.839
and rebuild this
from the ground up.

2:23:31.974 --> 2:23:33.976
That means we need a new story.

2:23:38.485 --> 2:23:40.184
TÁR:
Just here.

2:23:40.319 --> 2:23:41.914
Here. Thank you.

2:23:42.049 --> 2:23:44.023
(clears throat) Make it 40.

2:23:44.158 --> 2:23:45.724
Thank you.

2:23:53.529 --> 2:23:55.833
(sighs)

2:24:04.707 --> 2:24:07.009
(piano plays note)

2:24:08.009 --> 2:24:10.210
(piano playing discordant notes)

2:24:14.288 --> 2:24:16.348
(music stops)

2:24:53.160 --> 2:24:55.222
(sighs)

2:25:00.462 --> 2:25:02.933
(orchestra playing
lively classical music over TV)

2:25:17.779 --> 2:25:19.047
(music ends)

2:25:19.183 --> 2:25:21.110
(over TV):
Didn't you feel triumphant?

2:25:21.245 --> 2:25:23.250
(applause over TV)

2:25:24.620 --> 2:25:28.289
Now we can really understand
what the meaning of music is.

2:25:28.424 --> 2:25:32.556
It's the way it makes you feel
when you hear it.

2:25:32.691 --> 2:25:35.659
Finally, we've taken
that last giant step.

2:25:35.794 --> 2:25:38.168
And we're there.
We know what music means now.

2:25:38.304 --> 2:25:41.004
And we don't have to know
a lot of stuff about sharps

2:25:41.139 --> 2:25:43.470
and flats and chords
and all that business

2:25:43.606 --> 2:25:48.411
in order to understand music
if it tells us something.

2:25:48.546 --> 2:25:51.984
And the most wonderful thing of
all is that there's no limit to

2:25:52.119 --> 2:25:56.219
the different kinds of feelings
music can make you have.

2:25:56.354 --> 2:26:00.155
And some of those feelings
are so special and so deep

2:26:00.290 --> 2:26:02.659
that they can't even be
described in words.

2:26:02.795 --> 2:26:03.992
You see, we can't always name

2:26:04.128 --> 2:26:05.396
-the things we feel.
-(sobs softly)

2:26:05.531 --> 2:26:06.496
Sometimes we can.

2:26:06.632 --> 2:26:07.998
We can say we feel joy,

2:26:08.133 --> 2:26:11.832
pleasure, peacefulness,
whatever, love, hate.

2:26:11.968 --> 2:26:14.070
But every once in a while,

2:26:14.206 --> 2:26:16.905
we have feelings that are
so deep and so special

2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:18.666
that we have no words for them.

2:26:18.802 --> 2:26:21.678
And that's where music
is so marvelous,

2:26:21.813 --> 2:26:23.946
because music names them for us,

2:26:24.082 --> 2:26:26.881
only in notes
instead of in words.

2:26:27.016 --> 2:26:28.414
It's all in the way music moves.

2:26:28.549 --> 2:26:31.186
You must never forget
that music is movement,

2:26:31.321 --> 2:26:34.023
always going somewhere,
shifting and changing

2:26:34.159 --> 2:26:37.863
and flowing
from one note to another.

2:26:37.998 --> 2:26:39.360
-(crying)
-And that movement can tell us

2:26:39.495 --> 2:26:42.624
more about the way we feel
than a million words can.

2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:44.361
And here we're going
to play you a...

2:26:44.496 --> 2:26:46.872
-(VCR clicks)
-(whimpers)

2:26:49.510 --> 2:26:51.466
(door opens in distance)

2:26:51.601 --> 2:26:53.406
(exhales sharply, sniffles)

2:26:58.846 --> 2:27:00.545
Tony.

2:27:01.849 --> 2:27:03.387
Oh.

2:27:03.522 --> 2:27:04.651
Hi, Linda.

2:27:04.786 --> 2:27:06.081
Sorry.

2:27:06.216 --> 2:27:08.284
Lydia.

2:27:08.419 --> 2:27:10.659
Ma said you'd be over.

2:27:10.795 --> 2:27:13.129
You must be hiding out.

2:27:13.898 --> 2:27:16.424
Why would I be hiding out?

2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:18.636
Beats the hell out of me.

2:27:18.771 --> 2:27:21.038
None of my business anyhow.

2:27:22.107 --> 2:27:24.602
Lot of loose ends,
you got to admit.

2:27:26.370 --> 2:27:27.737
What do you mean?

2:27:27.872 --> 2:27:30.082
Well, like I said,
it ain't my business.

2:27:31.252 --> 2:27:33.408
But you don't seem to know
where the hell you came from

2:27:33.543 --> 2:27:35.217
or where you're going.

2:27:40.090 --> 2:27:42.323
(woman speaking Thai over P.A.)

2:27:47.997 --> 2:27:50.265
(water runs, stops)

2:28:10.117 --> 2:28:12.287
(traffic passing)

2:28:17.993 --> 2:28:20.630
(rooster crowing)

2:28:20.765 --> 2:28:22.627
(car horn honking)

2:28:27.530 --> 2:28:29.271
May I come inside?

2:28:30.543 --> 2:28:32.175
Thank you.

2:28:33.845 --> 2:28:37.114
(conversing in Tagalog)

2:28:44.118 --> 2:28:45.653
Um, I'm so sorry.

2:28:45.789 --> 2:28:48.323
Uh, we just wanted to confirm
that the composer was in fact

2:28:48.458 --> 2:28:50.393
not flying in from Osaka
to attend the concert.

2:28:50.529 --> 2:28:51.988
Oh.

2:28:52.124 --> 2:28:55.166
I-I must tell you that I-I
looked in the music libraries,

2:28:55.301 --> 2:28:58.902
uh, for her score,
but I-I couldn't find anything.

2:28:59.037 --> 2:29:01.165
-This just arrived.
-Ah.

2:29:01.301 --> 2:29:03.503
That's great. Thank you.

2:29:04.706 --> 2:29:07.178
Shirley and Cirio will be
most happy to show you

2:29:07.313 --> 2:29:09.437
-the sights of our beautiful
country. -Oh. Thank you.

2:29:09.572 --> 2:29:11.240
Thank you so much.

2:29:11.376 --> 2:29:13.385
Oh, goodness.

2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:15.218
Thank-thank you.

2:29:20.989 --> 2:29:23.721
(man howls)

2:29:39.042 --> 2:29:41.277
(motor rattling quietly)

2:29:46.352 --> 2:29:50.445
Maybe we could stop somewhere
and take a swim.

2:29:50.581 --> 2:29:52.052
Yeah, at the waterfall.

2:29:52.188 --> 2:29:54.158
But, mm, not in the river.

2:29:54.293 --> 2:29:56.728
Why? Is there something wrong
with the water?

2:29:56.863 --> 2:29:59.462
N-No. There are crocodiles.

2:29:59.598 --> 2:30:01.429
Oh.

2:30:01.564 --> 2:30:04.068
I didn't think
they'd be this far inland.

2:30:04.204 --> 2:30:07.129
They escaped from
Marlon Brando movie.

2:30:07.265 --> 2:30:08.739
Wow.

2:30:08.875 --> 2:30:11.641
That was a long time ago.

2:30:11.777 --> 2:30:13.573
They survive.

2:30:19.744 --> 2:30:22.054
(playful screaming, laughter)

2:30:28.452 --> 2:30:30.586
(Shirley whoops)

2:30:30.721 --> 2:30:32.757
(Shirley and Cirio laughing)

2:30:40.237 --> 2:30:43.471
(men speaking Tagalog, kissing)

2:30:47.808 --> 2:30:50.280
-Lady. Lady.
-(chatter continues) -(kissing)

2:30:52.280 --> 2:30:53.676
Here is prescription.

2:30:53.811 --> 2:30:55.443
-Ten dollars.
-Oh. Thank you.

2:30:55.579 --> 2:30:56.715
(pills rattle)

2:30:56.851 --> 2:31:00.957
Uh, is there somewhere
around here-- thank you--

2:31:01.092 --> 2:31:03.019
where I could get a massage?

2:31:03.154 --> 2:31:05.627
Was hoping it might help me
with this jet lag.

2:31:05.763 --> 2:31:07.629
(sighs)

2:31:07.765 --> 2:31:09.631
Hmm.

2:31:09.767 --> 2:31:10.893
Yes.

2:31:11.028 --> 2:31:13.703
There is
the very nice place I know.

2:31:13.838 --> 2:31:15.468
Thank you.

2:31:15.603 --> 2:31:18.110
(relaxing music playing
over speakers)

2:31:28.655 --> 2:31:29.855
Thank you.

2:31:29.990 --> 2:31:31.755
Please step over
to the fishbowl.

2:31:31.891 --> 2:31:33.657
The... the fishbowl?

2:31:33.792 --> 2:31:35.457
Yes, over there.

2:31:40.967 --> 2:31:42.198
Um, I'm sorry, I'm confused.

2:31:42.334 --> 2:31:44.532
H-How does this...
how does it work?

2:31:45.334 --> 2:31:47.568
You just pick a number here.

2:31:48.972 --> 2:31:50.903
I pick a number?

2:31:51.039 --> 2:31:52.610
Yes.

2:31:52.745 --> 2:31:54.311
(chuckles)

2:32:03.551 --> 2:32:05.817
RECEPTIONIST:
Number five?

2:32:11.488 --> 2:32:13.330
(gasps)

2:32:18.496 --> 2:32:20.099
(gagging)

2:32:20.234 --> 2:32:22.504
(retching)

2:32:24.677 --> 2:32:25.907
(groans)

2:32:26.042 --> 2:32:27.674
(panting)

2:32:34.252 --> 2:32:36.518
(music playing quietly over TV)

2:32:43.292 --> 2:32:45.560
(woman speaking Tagalog)

2:32:49.198 --> 2:32:50.892
Good morning.

2:32:51.027 --> 2:32:52.403
MUSICIANS:
Good morning.

2:32:52.539 --> 2:32:55.063
Now, before we begin,
let's-let's talk a bit about

2:32:55.199 --> 2:32:58.705
the composer's intent
with this piece.

2:33:00.046 --> 2:33:01.943
And what she might be after.

2:33:02.079 --> 2:33:03.906
(busy chatter)

2:33:04.042 --> 2:33:06.317
(pop music playing
over speakers)

2:33:21.058 --> 2:33:22.894
-(sighs)
-MAN: Five minutes.

2:33:24.403 --> 2:33:26.634
(instruments warming up
in distance)

2:33:31.173 --> 2:33:33.410
(panting softly)

2:33:35.143 --> 2:33:36.704
(gasps)

2:33:36.839 --> 2:33:38.111
(exhales sharply)

2:33:38.246 --> 2:33:40.483
(applause)

2:33:49.258 --> 2:33:51.461
(applause swells)

2:33:54.432 --> 2:33:56.433
-Thank you.
-(applause fades)

2:34:04.307 --> 2:34:06.344
(mechanical whirring)

2:34:10.773 --> 2:34:12.317
(whirring stops)

(fabric rustling over speakers)

2:34:18.487 --> 2:34:20.087
(orchestra playing gentle music)

2:34:20.222 --> 2:34:24.226
ANNOUNCER: Sisters and brothers
of the Fifth Fleet, it's time.

2:34:24.361 --> 2:34:26.821
I'll keep my farewell brief.

2:34:26.957 --> 2:34:29.423
Never was much with words.

2:34:29.559 --> 2:34:33.562
Once you board this ship,
there's no turning back.

2:34:33.697 --> 2:34:37.841
The next ground your feet touch
will be that of the New World.

2:34:37.976 --> 2:34:40.344
(music building)

2:34:40.479 --> 2:34:42.336
If any of you
have lost your nerve,

2:34:42.472 --> 2:34:46.707
then step away now
and let no one judge you.
