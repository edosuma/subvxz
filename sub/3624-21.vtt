Ooh.
[Telephone rings]

00:26.060 --> 00:27.559
Standing by for sitch, Wade.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.162
Um, cat up a tree
really doesn't seem

00:30.164 --> 00:31.130
like a battlesuit mission.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.266
You haven't seen the cat.

00:37.003 --> 00:38.037
[Gasps]

00:38.039 --> 00:40.939
We're gonna need a bigger boat

00:40.941 --> 00:43.208
ooh! Sassy
is so frightened!

00:43.210 --> 00:46.111
By any chance
is sassy a cougar?

00:46.113 --> 00:48.147
Ooh, heavens, no.
She's a puma.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.982
Oh, that's completely different.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.316
No, it's not!
Oh, well.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.851
Nothing says battlesuit mission

00:52.853 --> 00:55.154
like a puma on the edge.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.793
Nice kitty.
Nice sassy!

01:00.795 --> 01:01.627
[Growls]

01:01.629 --> 01:04.963
Hey, I said nice!

[Growls]

01:13.140 --> 01:14.239
Sassy, whoa!

01:14.241 --> 01:16.708
Ooh, sassy doesn't
like men so much.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.144
No, no! I'm, like,
barely a man!

01:19.146 --> 01:22.181
See, there was this mix-up
at my bar mitzvah and...

01:22.183 --> 01:23.682
Kim!

01:28.988 --> 01:31.056
Force field!
Fierce!

01:31.058 --> 01:33.058
Stop teasing my sassy!

01:33.060 --> 01:35.094
Hmmph. Let's
go home, girl.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.863
Um, yeah, gotta ask.
Why a pet puma?

01:37.865 --> 01:42.734
Because the grizzly didn't
get along with the gator!

01:42.736 --> 01:43.802
[Kimmunicator beeps]

01:43.804 --> 01:44.903
It was a big cat, Wade.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.138
I told you
it was a battlesuit job.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.174
It's all good. Everything
seems to be working.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.349
with-the-hand-thing
battlesuit

03:04.351 --> 03:08.253
and the sad fact that it is
in that schoolgirl's closet

instead of my closet! Ach!

03:10.257 --> 03:14.359
Myron, you are in

03:14.361 --> 03:16.261
Further! Giant step.

Make it 2 giant steps

You are golden, myron!
Stay there!

03:25.172 --> 03:27.839
When do you start
showing me the ropes

03:27.841 --> 03:29.274
like you swore
to Hildegard you would?

03:29.276 --> 03:31.944
Myron, just because
you married my sister

03:31.946 --> 03:34.112
does not mean
you have what it takes

03:34.114 --> 03:35.280
to be a Dementor henchman!

03:35.282 --> 03:38.183
But if you keep
making me go away, BIL...

I can call you Bil,

03:45.159 --> 03:46.225
and you can call me Bil.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.093
Wouldn't that be fun, Bil?

03:48.095 --> 03:49.228
Go away, Myron.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.231
Wait! What if
[Sighs] I could get you

03:52.233 --> 03:55.000
that self-stepping,
spring-hand battlesuit?

03:55.002 --> 03:58.070
It is a self-healing,
spring-stepping suit!

03:58.072 --> 04:00.038
And what makes you
think you can get it?

04:00.040 --> 04:03.342
If I fail, I go back
to the strudel-works!

04:03.344 --> 04:05.777
This calls for a plan, Bil.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.079
Now, that strange boy

04:07.081 --> 04:09.047
she is improbably dating
is the key.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.816
Strange boy. Got it.
You have a name?

04:10.818 --> 04:13.118
I do not know...
The sidekick.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.989
Once I have him, I will exchange
him for the battlesuit!

04:16.991 --> 04:20.092
No, no photo,
but you cannot miss him!

04:20.094 --> 04:21.960
You see a guy with Kim Possible

04:21.962 --> 04:25.130
who looks like he should
not be with Kim Possible,

04:25.132 --> 04:27.399
that is him!

04:28.401 --> 04:29.368

04:29.370 --> 04:31.203
Came as fast
as I could, K.P.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.938
What's the emergency?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.306
[Chattering]

04:34.308 --> 04:35.540
Cousin Larry's birthday!

04:35.542 --> 04:38.310
That's an emergency?
He has one every year.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.878
Yeah, mm-hmm,
but every year

04:39.880 --> 04:42.080
I don't get the job of
keeping him out of the house

04:42.082 --> 04:43.415
so his surprise party
can be a surprise.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.251
Oh, oh! And you're
hoping I'll tag along

04:46.253 --> 04:48.054
and talk geek with him
so you're off the hook.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.155
Not exactly how I was going
to put it, but, yeah.

04:50.157 --> 04:53.125
Yeah, sorry, K.P. no can do.
I have to watch Hannah.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.360
I mean, that's way more
important than having fun.

04:55.362 --> 04:58.163
See? You think spending
time with Larry is fun.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.899
But I have
responsibilities now, Kim.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.302
I've put childish things
behind me.

05:03.304 --> 05:06.238
Hey! [Laughs] I forgot
I stuck that in my pocket.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.973
How 'bout if I baby-sit
and you Larry-sit?

05:07.975 --> 05:12.277
Look, K.P., I know you and Larry
don't exactly share the same...

05:12.279 --> 05:14.513
Interests, but you know what?

05:14.515 --> 05:18.050
He's just as confused by
your cuddle-buddy collection

05:18.052 --> 05:19.051
as you are by his hobbies.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.253
I guess.
How does Larry know

05:21.255 --> 05:25.324
I, um, might have mentioned
something to him.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.592
You know, we chat now and then.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.061
[Slurps]

05:29.063 --> 05:32.064
See, the thing is,
in the graphic novel,

05:32.066 --> 05:34.333
dark megaton's powers
are biomechanical,

05:34.335 --> 05:36.868
but in the movie,
they're electromechanical.

05:36.870 --> 05:40.172
Uh, right. Do you ever
read any real books, Larry?

05:40.174 --> 05:44.309
Uh, I don't read novels.
I read novelizations.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.111
Oh, here we are.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.046
Do we have to?
Uh, need I remind you,

05:48.048 --> 05:50.949
cousin, it's my birthday.

05:50.951 --> 05:56.855
Who doesn't look like he
belongs with Kim Possible.

05:57.224 --> 06:01.226
Ahem. I request
sanctuary for myself

06:01.228 --> 06:03.161
and this maiden
in your dungeon.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.130
All: Enter, dragon tamer!

06:05.132 --> 06:07.632
Standard greeting.
We are welcomed.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.900
Oh. Wonderful.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.202
Um, check it out, Larry.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.003
The <i>fearless ferret</i>
<i>finally comes</i>

06:12.005 --> 06:17.309
seen it. Total rip-off of
issue 162 of the <i>green llama.</i>

06:17.311 --> 06:19.344
Hmm. As per usual,
you're right.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.380
I'm kinda like
the Alpha dog here.

06:21.382 --> 06:27.919
Besides, issue 162 of <i>Green
Llama</i> was pretty weak overall.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.654
Where are you
coming from, Charlotte?

06:29.656 --> 06:31.189
That was a landmark issue.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.158
Hey, Larry, we're
starting. You in?

06:33.160 --> 06:34.526
Most definitely.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.229
Oh, hi, Kim, but here I'm known

06:37.231 --> 06:40.665
of course you are. Uh,
what is this game anyway?

06:40.667 --> 06:43.902
Doesn't matter. Larry's mastered
all the role-playing games.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.138
He's a galactic outer,
a dungeon magus,

06:46.140 --> 06:48.640
a dragon tamer, a
level-5 pacion warrior.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.042
Scenario 3 copacetic
with everyone?

06:51.044 --> 06:52.477
Scenario 3. Outstanding!

06:52.479 --> 06:54.413
Scenario 5 is more challenging.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.248
Don't start with me, Charlotte.

06:56.250 --> 07:00.252
Kim: I think I'll just go get
a smoothie or something.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.753
Larry: Yeah, sure.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.755
Real world! Real world!

07:03.757 --> 07:06.458
Whew! Good. That was close.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.995
You know what? Cousin!

07:09.997 --> 07:13.165
Uh, hi.
Righteous costumes.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.433
Larry!

07:14.435 --> 07:16.168
Aaah!

07:17.236 --> 07:19.938
What's the sitch?
[Laughs]

07:19.940 --> 07:21.206
Isn't that
what you say? Sitch?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.175
Larry, find some place safe.

07:23.177 --> 07:24.943
This is awesome!

07:24.945 --> 07:27.245
My cousin's engaged in combat.

07:27.247 --> 07:32.250
Uh, it's more like the <i>zombie
mayhem expansion pack.</i>

07:32.252 --> 07:35.954
You don't know
anything, Charlotte!

07:37.156 --> 07:40.725
Well, that was kinda
like <i>kick fight, 3-d.</i>

07:40.727 --> 07:43.328
Should we maybe not be here?

07:43.330 --> 07:47.365
Are you for real?
It's just getting good!

07:50.136 --> 07:51.269
Charlotte:
The dungeon magus!

07:51.271 --> 07:53.738
Cousin!
Aren't you coming?

07:53.740 --> 07:56.308
You bet I am!

08:02.114 --> 08:05.016
Get rid of the mean girl!

08:06.619 --> 08:09.087
Oh! Sorry.
Didn't mean to do that.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.256
[Grunts] Sorry!

08:11.491 --> 08:14.159
[Growls]

08:16.095 --> 08:17.229
Duh... Kimmy-cup. Whoa!

08:17.231 --> 08:20.499
This party is not
ready to get started.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.235
Well, something
sort of happened,

08:23.237 --> 08:26.071
and, um, Larry's
kind of... Missing.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.038
You lost Larry?

08:27.040 --> 08:30.008
I only left him for a
few minutes, aunt June.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.410
You left Larry alone?

08:32.412 --> 08:35.480
How could you leave
my little Larry alone?

08:35.781 --> 08:37.115
Um, Larry is 19.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.450
You can leave
19-year-olds alone.

08:38.452 --> 08:41.686
Larry isn't like
other 19-year-olds!

08:41.688 --> 08:44.189
Yeah, tell me about it.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.667
Who is this uber-nerd?

08:55.669 --> 08:58.069
Kim Possible's sidekick.

08:58.071 --> 09:01.306
Uh, hello?
I am a dragon tamer

09:01.308 --> 09:03.208
and level-5
tiakon warrior.

09:03.210 --> 09:07.078
I haven't been a level-1
sidekick since third grade.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.281
Myron, you disappoint me!

09:09.283 --> 09:13.318
But you said... I... I
mean... wh-wh-what the...

09:13.320 --> 09:14.386
well, just look at him!

09:14.388 --> 09:16.187
He fits the description!

09:16.189 --> 09:18.757
This place is so convincing.

09:18.759 --> 09:19.824
What is he talking about?

09:19.826 --> 09:22.427
[Laughs] The detail
is ridiculous!

09:22.429 --> 09:24.195
This is the best birthday ever!

09:24.197 --> 09:26.064
I can't believe Kim
went to all this trouble

09:26.066 --> 09:28.767
after acting like she didn't
even want to be seen with me!

09:28.769 --> 09:31.469
You are speaking in nonsense!
This troubles me.

09:31.471 --> 09:35.206
That Kim! She pretends not
to know anything about rpgs,

09:35.208 --> 09:37.442
and then she hooks all this up!

09:37.444 --> 09:38.543
RPG?

09:38.545 --> 09:40.412
Role-playing game.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.346
So I'm told.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.181
This is no game, freaky boy!

09:43.183 --> 09:45.584
Right. [Laughs]
And your game name is...

09:45.586 --> 09:49.254
<i>Nein.</i> Listen! I am
Professor Dementor!

09:49.256 --> 09:51.856
<i>Ja.</i> Of course.
You know of me?

09:51.858 --> 09:53.458
Oh, no.
It's the helmet.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.293
It's standard
super-villain wear

09:55.295 --> 09:56.561
in this kind
of a role play. Ha ha.

09:56.563 --> 09:59.431
I mean, what kind of a rube
do you take me for?

09:59.433 --> 10:02.300
The outfit is kind of a cliché.

10:02.302 --> 10:06.471
The stuffing of
the strudel, myron!

10:06.473 --> 10:08.273
[Laser shooting]

10:08.275 --> 10:10.275
Far out!

10:12.244 --> 10:16.748
He's even more annoying
than the sidekick!

10:17.650 --> 10:19.417
Kim:
Dementor has Larry!

10:19.419 --> 10:20.785
What? When?
Where? How?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.221
Ron! Wait, why? Ok, go ahead.

10:23.223 --> 10:27.192
Well, I can't go anywhere
until my parents get back.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.495
Can I? Can I go?
No, I can't.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.898
No, mom specifically
said no missions

10:33.900 --> 10:35.600
and to go easy on
the strained peas.

10:35.602 --> 10:39.704
More like recon. We check
Dementor's known lairs.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.206
By then, your parents
should be home.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.209
We drop off han, then
go back and rescue Larry.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.877
Uh, I don't know.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.713
We can stop for ice cream.

10:48.715 --> 10:52.150
Both: Yay! Ha ha ha!

10:52.152 --> 10:53.718
Just to recap,

10:53.720 --> 10:56.821
I still do not
have the self-healing,

10:56.823 --> 10:58.823
spring-stepping suit!

10:58.825 --> 11:01.359
But I do have Larry.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.795
Kim's battlesuit?
Way cool!

11:03.797 --> 11:05.363
Go on, hostage, speak.

11:05.365 --> 11:10.735
What are you talking about? The
sense you are making is not!

11:10.737 --> 11:13.672
If you want the battlesuit,
just go for it.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.306
Direct line of attack.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.941
And how do you suggest

11:16.943 --> 11:19.244
we do that, Larry?

11:19.246 --> 11:21.246
We do not even
know where it is!

11:21.248 --> 11:23.248
Duh. There's
a secret panel

11:23.250 --> 11:24.282
in the back of her closet

11:24.284 --> 11:26.951
right behind
the strategories game.

11:26.953 --> 11:31.222
Somebody untie him
and get him a refreshment.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.324
Boy, you're not
very good at this.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.326
This is a pretty boss
lair and everything,

11:35.328 --> 11:37.529
but I wish Kim had
gotten a better villain.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.364
Did your girl cousin mention

11:39.366 --> 11:43.401
as part of the game,
you get to lead a mission?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.837
Nope. No spoilers.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.205
She did not want you to know

11:47.207 --> 11:48.306
that she would
be playing the part

11:48.308 --> 11:51.276
of the girl whose
closet we break into.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.344
Yes. With
your working props

11:53.346 --> 11:54.879
and my insider knowledge,

11:54.881 --> 11:56.247
we'll be unstoppable!

11:56.249 --> 11:59.884
Kim Possible
doesn't stand a chance!

11:59.886 --> 12:01.486
[Laughs]

12:01.488 --> 12:04.456
[All laugh]

12:04.458 --> 12:06.858
That's gonna need some work.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.727
[Slurps]

12:13.999 --> 12:16.968
Anybody home? Hello?

12:16.970 --> 12:19.003
Yeah, you know,
that sounds real empty.

12:19.005 --> 12:22.307
Echo!
Hannah: Echo. Echo!

12:22.309 --> 12:25.009
Dead end, Wade.
What's next?

12:26.011 --> 12:28.546
I only pushed one button!

12:31.984 --> 12:33.284
[Giggles]

12:33.286 --> 12:37.388
Uh, don't touch
anything else, ok?

12:37.590 --> 12:41.392
Computer: Self-destruct
sequence initiated.

12:43.697 --> 12:47.732
Maybe we should wait for
your parents to take han.

12:47.734 --> 12:48.967
It wasn't me!

12:48.969 --> 12:52.303
Right. I suppose
it was the baby.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.273
[Baby talk]

12:55.641 --> 12:57.442
Hey, it's Larry!

12:57.444 --> 12:58.343
All: Larry!

12:58.345 --> 13:00.378
Oh. Hey, guys.
And Charlotte.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.615
Uh, did you forget
the dragon tamer greeting?

13:03.617 --> 13:05.650
Can't.
I'm in a scenario.

13:05.652 --> 13:06.885
All: Ooh!

13:06.887 --> 13:07.952
Cool costume, Larry.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.989
Like the <i>quantum</i>
<i>probability squad.</i>

13:10.991 --> 13:14.359
Uh, more like the alternate
timeline version

13:14.361 --> 13:15.059
of <i>team unusual.</i>

13:15.061 --> 13:16.561
Don't start, Charlotte!

13:16.563 --> 13:21.432
Yes. We are in a hurry
to commit illegal acts.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.336
It is an RPG scenario.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.971
All: Whoa.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.908
That short kid was a weirdo.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.843
Ron's mom: Thanks for
helping Ron watch Hannah.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.411
I hope she wasn't
too much trouble.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.013
Oh, no. No
trouble at all.

13:35.015 --> 13:39.818
Explosion! Did you take
your sister on a mission?

13:39.820 --> 13:42.987
Just a... uh, what
was that word, Kim?

13:42.989 --> 13:45.023
Yeah, we took her
on one of those.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.792
Perfectly safe!
Not like a mission.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.727
Except for the lasers.

13:49.729 --> 13:50.862
There were lasers?

13:50.864 --> 13:53.598
[Giggles]

13:57.770 --> 14:00.538
Hello?
Anyone home?

14:00.540 --> 14:04.709
I'll bet
it was a cover surprise

14:04.711 --> 14:05.910
in case I had discovered

14:05.912 --> 14:09.914
the true surprise
of this role-play party.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.951
<i>Ja.</i> That is exactly it.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.619
Look! Cookies!

14:15.521 --> 14:17.021
Oh!

14:17.790 --> 14:19.557
You don't have to do that.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.025
I already know
where she keeps it.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.027
You try to stop them.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.530
Touché.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.735
It's keyed to Kim's handprint.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.770
So far, I am
less than impressed

14:32.772 --> 14:34.639
with your scenario 11!

14:34.641 --> 14:37.709
I did not even get any cookies.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.477
Larry: That
was just part one...

14:39.479 --> 14:41.112
identify the target.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.148
I am running
out of the patience!

14:44.150 --> 14:46.417
Yeah, if you're not
going to play to win,

14:46.419 --> 14:47.986
why play it at all?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.153
Very well.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.623
Bring in
the E.L.B.D.!

14:51.625 --> 14:52.891
Ooh! Ooh!

14:52.893 --> 14:54.125
Yes, myron.

14:54.127 --> 14:58.696
Larry and Dementor: Extremely
large blaster device.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.031
How did you know that?

15:00.033 --> 15:03.601
A little unorthodox
to bring into scenario 11,

15:03.603 --> 15:04.969
but I guess it's ok

15:04.971 --> 15:06.604
this time.

15:07.073 --> 15:10.475
The E.L.B.D. Is
a very complicated...

15:10.477 --> 15:12.443
you said I could
lead the mission.

15:12.445 --> 15:16.014
Everybody heard you say it.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.016
Fine! Go work
the E.L.B.D.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.952
Everyone else, take cover!

15:22.454 --> 15:25.056
[Larry giggles]

15:25.058 --> 15:27.058
[Explosion]

15:27.060 --> 15:28.426
You think he's ok?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.128
Do I care?

15:31.163 --> 15:33.464
What happened?
The suit's not there.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.966
Ach.
More disappointment.

15:34.968 --> 15:40.071
That you do not know how to
use the E.L.B.D. Properly!

15:40.073 --> 15:41.973
Follow me!

15:41.975 --> 15:43.908
See? Told you.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.076
Now what do we do?

15:45.078 --> 15:46.611
Well, scenario 13-a...

15:46.613 --> 15:49.447
<i>nein!</i> No more
with the scenarios.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.115
We comb this miserable suburb

15:51.117 --> 15:53.518
until the Kim Possible
I am finding

15:53.520 --> 15:55.153
and I take the suit from her!

15:55.155 --> 15:59.991
Oh-ho! This is
the best birthday ever!

15:59.993 --> 16:03.261
[Giggles maniacally]

16:08.001 --> 16:09.867
Wade:
You're already there.

16:09.869 --> 16:10.969
Dementor and his henchmen

16:10.971 --> 16:12.236
have been spotted in Middleton.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.005
Really?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.209
Maybe Dementor is over
Larry's geek-speak.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.644
[Woman gasps] There she is.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.012
Oh, no.
They found me!

16:21.014 --> 16:24.215
Worse. Aunt June
and my dad.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.852
Instead of just
standing around,

16:27.854 --> 16:30.054
you could make yourself useful.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.789
What?

16:32.124 --> 16:36.060
Outstanding dungeon magus gear!

16:36.062 --> 16:37.996
Aunt June, this
really isn't necessary.

16:37.998 --> 16:42.133
And just how do you propose
we find my lost Larry?

16:42.135 --> 16:45.169
I'll find Larry
when I find Dementor.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.638
[Laughing evilly]

16:47.640 --> 16:50.241
Not if I find you first!

16:51.777 --> 16:53.177
Do you mind?

16:53.179 --> 16:55.780
This is a private conversation.

16:55.782 --> 16:56.714
Uh, Kimmy-cup.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.183
No worries, dad.
I'm on it.

17:00.886 --> 17:04.122
[Kung-fu yell]

17:04.124 --> 17:05.923
Ow! Pulled
something... wha!

17:05.925 --> 17:09.127
Oh! You're the guy who's
with Kim Possible,

17:09.129 --> 17:11.195
but doesn't look
like he belongs

17:11.197 --> 17:14.632
what's that supposed to mean?

17:15.634 --> 17:16.734
Whoa! Ow!

17:16.736 --> 17:19.303
Oh! What is
happening here?

17:19.305 --> 17:22.106
Oh, uh, super-villains,
henchmen, kung fu.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.275
Teen stuff, you know.

17:25.110 --> 17:27.845
Larry: Give up,
Kim Possible!

17:27.847 --> 17:28.780
Larry?
Wow!

17:28.782 --> 17:32.917
That's perfect
for the scenario.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.020
K.P.!

17:36.022 --> 17:39.157
Bring them all
back to the lair!

17:39.792 --> 17:43.661
I give the orders here!

17:43.663 --> 17:47.065
On the other hand, uh,
that is a pretty good one.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.900
What he said!

17:53.706 --> 17:57.942
On the bright side, we finally
found the right lair.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.216
What's up with Larry?

18:05.218 --> 18:07.919
It's like he's enjoying this.

18:07.921 --> 18:08.986
Mind control, maybe?

18:08.988 --> 18:10.054
What is all this?

18:10.056 --> 18:12.256
It's scenario 11, that's what.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.026
Honey, I have no idea
what that means.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.227
<i>Ja!</i> It means
that at last

18:16.229 --> 18:19.864
I will acquire
Kim Possible's battlesuit!

18:19.866 --> 18:22.733
Yeah.
Something like that.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.635
I'm still not following.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.072
Well, we've got a villain,
henchmen, and a trap.

18:28.074 --> 18:32.143
Kim Possible! Tell me
where it is, then perhaps,

18:32.145 --> 18:36.681
perhaps, I can let all
these people go in freedom.

18:36.683 --> 18:40.151
<i>Ja.</i> It is
a very clear statement

18:40.153 --> 18:41.152
of demand and consequence.

18:41.154 --> 18:44.922
Please. Surrender
or be destroyed!

18:44.924 --> 18:48.159
Listen. I will admit
you have been helpful

18:48.161 --> 18:50.194
with your scenarios,
but this situation

18:50.196 --> 18:55.333
calls for a certain amount of
experience and expertise!

18:59.639 --> 19:03.875
Scenarios? Kim, I think
I know what's going on.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.977
Larry thinks all of this
is a role-playing game.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.213
No way. I think even Larry
can tell the difference

19:09.215 --> 19:10.381
between real life and a game.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.316
Uh, dragon tamer. Hello?

19:12.318 --> 19:18.055
Yo, lare! We lookin'
at scenario 19 here?

19:18.057 --> 19:19.690
Precisely.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.146
Whoa!

19:53.192 --> 19:56.694
So, show your true colors
at last! I commend you

19:56.696 --> 19:58.930
on an exceptionally
clever ruse!

19:58.932 --> 20:01.832
What ruse?
Scenario 19 is like

20:01.834 --> 20:05.770
the whole point
of the adventure!

20:05.772 --> 20:08.272
Kim and Dementor: What are you
doing with that battlesuit?

20:08.274 --> 20:10.107
Larry and Ron:
Scenario 19!

20:10.109 --> 20:11.209
Is this over yet?

20:11.211 --> 20:15.179
I really need to lie down.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.748
Aah!

20:32.998 --> 20:34.298
Oof!

20:35.367 --> 20:37.401
Isn't that your battlesuit?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.237
Kim: Yeah, uh-huh.

20:39.239 --> 20:42.206
How did Larry know
where it was, Ron?

20:42.208 --> 20:43.774
Oh, I might've
mentioned something

20:43.776 --> 20:45.810
to him when he was
looking for board games.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.980
The end is now, geekling!

20:49.281 --> 20:50.948
Aah!

20:50.950 --> 20:53.284
Sounds good to me!

20:55.454 --> 20:58.122
Larry's mom:
So, are these other boys

20:58.124 --> 21:01.826
coming to the party,
too? [Giggles]

21:01.828 --> 21:04.495
I'm not sure I made
enough tuna sandwiches.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.130
Ooh! Tuna salad's
my favorite!

21:06.132 --> 21:09.400
Strudel-works, myron.
Strudel-works!

21:09.402 --> 21:12.970
Ma, don't you get it?
This was the party!

21:12.972 --> 21:17.041
Kim threw me the most
awesomest party ever!

21:17.043 --> 21:19.277
I think it's better if you did.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.177
Gotcha.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.212
Kimberly Ann.

21:21.214 --> 21:22.346
I owe you an apology.

21:22.348 --> 21:25.950
I've never seen
my Larry so happy!

21:25.952 --> 21:28.019
[Laughs] Hey,
maybe you should plan

21:28.021 --> 21:30.121
all Larry's birthdays
from now on!

21:30.123 --> 21:33.224
If we can figure out how
to get back to Middleton.

21:33.226 --> 21:34.458
Speaking of apologies,

21:34.460 --> 21:36.494
I guess I sort of
owe you one, too.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.395
What do you mean?

21:37.397 --> 21:41.065
All this comic book,
Sci-Fi gamer stuff,

21:41.067 --> 21:43.100
but, hey, it's your thing.
Have at it.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.070
Thanks, cousin, but I
prefer science fiction.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.938
Uh, Sci-Fi
is belittling.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.274
Ok. So, what is
scenario 19 anyway?

21:50.276 --> 21:53.344
A good guy infiltrates
a bad guy's operation...

21:53.346 --> 21:55.913
But then pulls
a dramatic double-cross

21:55.915 --> 21:58.149
at the last possible moment!

21:58.151 --> 22:02.486
Yeah. Y-you know what's cooler?
Real life.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.026
