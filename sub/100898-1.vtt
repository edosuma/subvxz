01:35.495 --> 01:35.964
Shh!

01:35.997 --> 01:37.599
Oh, shut your mouth.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.760
They're here.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.901
What time is it?

02:46.934 --> 02:48.703
I don't know,
I lost my watch.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.270
A lot of good you are!

03:26.406 --> 03:27.709
Time for some fun.

03:59.774 --> 04:02.009
Look here! A new watch!

04:03.044 --> 04:05.012
And it's got a stopwatch!

04:08.348 --> 04:09.784
I surrender.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.607
Gentlemen.

04:34.776 --> 04:36.476
That is the plan.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.715
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.454
Lieutenant Maes,

04:47.487 --> 04:49.056
the head
of the Belgian government

04:49.090 --> 04:51.058
selected you to lead
this operation.

04:51.092 --> 04:51.993
Mm.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.561
Good.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.963
Admiral Godfrey has agreed

04:55.997 --> 04:58.465
to give us
British logistical support.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.635
That was before I knew the plan.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.970
What you need
is psychological support.

05:03.004 --> 05:05.039
We understand you have

05:05.072 --> 05:06.808
different priorities,

05:06.841 --> 05:10.511
but all we're asking for
is the boat and the prisoner.

05:10.545 --> 05:12.079
Christ Almighty!

05:12.113 --> 05:13.848
where are you going to find
a crew that's up to this?

05:13.881 --> 05:15.550
We took care of that.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.685
We selected a group

05:17.718 --> 05:20.855
of loyal, well-trained
Belgian soldiers.

05:20.888 --> 05:21.989
I want the bad eggs.

05:23.124 --> 05:24.692
That's not what we discussed.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.927
The British army
have been looking

05:25.960 --> 05:27.695
for these lunatics for months.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.998
Their status on our files
is shoot on sight.

05:31.032 --> 05:32.767
Relax, Admiral.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.503
Nobody even knows
where they are.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.044
Withholding
the whereabouts of those people

05:43.077 --> 05:45.412
will see you face court martial.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.683
My chances of surviving
a firing squad

05:48.716 --> 05:50.417
are considerably higher

05:50.450 --> 05:52.352
than surviving
this mission, sir.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.657
They might be insane,
but so is this goddamn plan.

06:00.895 --> 06:04.098
Desperate times...
Desperate measures.

06:19.714 --> 06:22.415
Ask what you like,
but for Christ's sake, relax.

06:22.617 --> 06:24.085
We still need him.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.820
- Anyone fancy an apple?
- Later, Tamme.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.755
- Stan, you?
- Not now.

06:28.289 --> 06:29.957
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Werner?</i>

06:29.991 --> 06:31.559
- Hello.
- <i>Werner, can you hear me?</i>

06:31.592 --> 06:33.060
Yes, we...
We have the package.

06:33.094 --> 06:34.528
Sorry, repeat?

06:34.562 --> 06:36.429
I repeat,
we have the package.

06:36.463 --> 06:39.133
<i>Roger that. The mailman
will pick it up at noon.</i>

06:39.166 --> 06:40.968
<i>Now, make sure Stan</i>

06:41.002 --> 06:43.436
<i>doesn't damage the package
this time, will you?</i>

06:43.470 --> 06:47.975
Well, uh, he's just asking
the package a few questions.

06:48.009 --> 06:49.543
<i>I'm serious now.</i>

06:55.516 --> 06:58.019
Six, after shooting
that big, fat bear.

06:58.052 --> 06:59.620
- I've got six.
- The fat guy?

06:59.654 --> 07:00.922
Yeah, the big fat one.

07:00.955 --> 07:02.523
Don't be stupid, mate.
I shot the fat...

07:02.556 --> 07:04.992
Ah! God damn it!

07:06.661 --> 07:08.195
Come on, you bastard!

07:08.229 --> 07:09.931
You said I could go
with you this time!

07:09.964 --> 07:11.699
Was last minute!

07:12.499 --> 07:14.502
Always the same thing
around here!

07:17.138 --> 07:18.639
These potatoes are sprouting.

07:18.673 --> 07:20.508
Yeah, then do
the shopping yourself!

07:22.643 --> 07:24.045
I've had it!

07:26.814 --> 07:29.216
There's not a lot he can tell us
with his lungs full of water.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.751
How long now?

07:33.254 --> 07:34.956
One minute sixteen.

07:35.790 --> 07:37.490
That's enough.

07:39.260 --> 07:41.696
Hey, actually we're all
pretty friendly around here.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.065
Yeah, we're all very friendly
around here.

07:44.265 --> 07:46.033
Do you want some water?

07:46.067 --> 07:47.635
Alright, get out.

07:48.202 --> 07:51.672
Hey, just try to answer
our questions, please.

07:51.706 --> 07:53.007
This is for you.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.608
Just tell him what he needs...
Look out!

08:03.718 --> 08:05.252
<i>Werner, what's that?</i>

08:05.286 --> 08:06.954
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

08:06.988 --> 08:09.056
- Uh, uh, uh...
- <i>The package is okay, right?</i>

08:09.090 --> 08:11.659
- Uh, I-I hear nothing.
- <i>Werner?</i>

08:11.692 --> 08:14.028
- <i>I just heard a very loud bang...</i>
- Over and out!

08:17.131 --> 08:19.667
Damn it, they'll be coming
to fetch him soon!

08:19.700 --> 08:20.935
Stan!

08:20.968 --> 08:22.570
Now he's going to take up
less room.

08:29.043 --> 08:30.611
Forget it.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.850
With all due respect.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.928
Your son Dieter...

08:49.697 --> 08:50.831
Yep.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.268
I see the resemblance.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.715
KILLED IN ACTION

09:10.751 --> 09:12.653
- How?
- Shrapnel.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.989
No further information.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.900
Why are you telling me that?

09:30.304 --> 09:33.007
Do you really thing I'd betray
my country because of that?

09:34.909 --> 09:36.143
This is war.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.879
We've all lost someone.

09:40.214 --> 09:41.982
It's not about who we've lost.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.253
It's about who
we can still save.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.264
His name is Franz.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.234
Yep.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.337
The boy was named
after his grandfather.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.824
You alright?

10:23.858 --> 10:25.259
No, I'm not alright.

10:25.527 --> 10:27.862
I'm fed up with just doing
all of the shopping

10:27.895 --> 10:29.730
and prying bullets
out of people.

10:30.164 --> 10:31.866
I want another job.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.968
He just wants to protect
his little girl, that's all.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.270
- Leave me alone.
- Sorry. Hey...

10:37.872 --> 10:40.708
Actually, I found something
that might interest you.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.710
Here...

10:43.177 --> 10:44.311
What's that?

10:44.712 --> 10:47.681
A B cartridge, I think it said.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.750
I found a whole case of them.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.752
It's just the right caliber.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.421
First a kiss.

11:05.466 --> 11:06.901
Let's see what it can do.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.242
Wow.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.212
Not really ideal for hunting.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.248
Come on, then.

11:22.416 --> 11:25.219
Come on, Fons. Come on, Fons!

11:25.252 --> 11:27.188
- Come on!
- Oh!

11:28.923 --> 11:32.159
Yes! The best lefty
in Europe, huh!

11:32.193 --> 11:34.161
Come on, now, let's hear it!

11:36.030 --> 11:38.465
Oh, come on!
Is that the best you can do

11:38.499 --> 11:40.901
playing for the biggest club
in Flanders?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.170
Come on!

11:44.838 --> 11:46.407
Is that all?

11:46.440 --> 11:48.842
You'd be better off hunting
more and screwing less.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.377
Stan?

12:23.811 --> 12:27.081
Stan, there's a German car
parked in the wood.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.954
Darling?

12:53.007 --> 12:54.942
Your wife, I would presume?

12:59.614 --> 13:00.848
Here...

13:03.585 --> 13:05.520
You can sell it to the Jews.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.925
Where have you hidden them?

13:21.001 --> 13:22.036
Gunther?

13:23.871 --> 13:25.540
Fill up the bathtub.

13:52.466 --> 13:54.401
I've been to the post office.

13:55.336 --> 13:56.937
Still nothing.

13:57.338 --> 13:59.340
You don't suppose
something's happened?

13:59.373 --> 14:00.874
I'm sure
she would have written...

14:00.908 --> 14:02.443
I told you to put that
out of your mind.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.412
The mail is intercepted
at the French border.

14:09.983 --> 14:14.221
I was thinking that little Louis
is probably already walking.

14:17.559 --> 14:18.593
Sorry.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.863
We've got a visitor. Come.

14:32.674 --> 14:34.174
Hey.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.185
Hey.

14:45.486 --> 14:47.622
I need
that German's briefcase.

14:47.921 --> 14:52.960
Yeah, uh...
Everything's still in it, so...

14:53.260 --> 14:55.362
And the Fritz?
He's got crucial information

14:55.396 --> 14:57.565
about troop movements
in the Ardennes.

14:57.599 --> 14:59.166
Yeah, erm...

14:59.199 --> 15:01.335
The Fritz is still in the bath.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.272
You've got to be joking!

15:07.642 --> 15:10.310
His head
must be around here somewhere.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.983
Jesus, Stan!
This is no laughing matter.

15:16.450 --> 15:18.252
I laughed my head off.

15:20.688 --> 15:22.289
Any news?

15:26.761 --> 15:30.063
I have to tell you that this
is a very special mission.

15:32.634 --> 15:33.934
Congo?

15:34.536 --> 15:36.638
Finally getting out
of these fucking woods.

15:36.671 --> 15:38.205
I've even got ticks
on my balls.

15:38.740 --> 15:40.407
But Fritz isn't in the Congo.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.444
Forget it,
we're fine right here.

15:43.878 --> 15:46.380
The mission is of vital
strategical importance.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.715
We couldn't give a shit.

15:47.749 --> 15:49.249
We kill Krauts,
that's strategic enough.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.586
- Oh, do whatever you want.
- Hey.

15:51.619 --> 15:53.588
What do these figures
down at the bottom mean?

15:53.621 --> 15:55.322
It's what you get paid.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.625
Hey, Van Praag,
you can buy your football team!

15:57.659 --> 15:59.092
Great.

15:59.493 --> 16:01.395
Maybe they'll even let you
play again.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.665
Why not?

16:03.698 --> 16:05.132
As long as I'm wearing this
around my neck, Fons,

16:05.165 --> 16:07.000
it's not going to happen.

16:11.539 --> 16:13.240
Oh, yeah, one more thing.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.709
I forgot to say that
the mission would result

16:14.742 --> 16:17.311
in a whole bunch
of dead Nazis.

16:24.151 --> 16:27.488
And she would be a lot safer,
too, right?

16:51.211 --> 16:56.718
BELGIAN CONGO

17:01.221 --> 17:02.790
Alright, wake up, gentlemen!
We're there.

17:02.824 --> 17:05.827
Hey, hey, bloody hell, man.
Be reasonable.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.595
Oh, well then,

17:07.628 --> 17:10.030
you shouldn't have got so pissed
then, should you?

17:10.698 --> 17:14.233
Alright, there it is, men!
Take a look.

17:56.878 --> 17:59.446
What's up?
You're turning green.

18:00.615 --> 18:02.282
I just don't like water.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.152
I can't swim.

18:05.820 --> 18:07.822
Maybe they have water wings!

18:12.527 --> 18:15.697
Men, welcome to Africa.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.268
I told you that it
was a special mission.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.337
Come.

18:33.447 --> 18:35.215
Don't touch anything.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.151
Jesus, it stinks.

18:41.455 --> 18:43.223
Okay, men.

18:44.257 --> 18:47.294
For those of you who aren't
very good in geography,

18:48.395 --> 18:49.831
we are right here.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.735
And our destination
is here, America.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.169
The mission's objective:

18:56.203 --> 18:57.905
transporting a cargo
of raw materials

18:57.939 --> 19:00.474
of crucial importance
to the Allies.

19:01.876 --> 19:03.276
Uranium.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.781
- Uranium?
- What in God's name is that?

19:06.814 --> 19:09.383
I've heard of it,
it's used to color glass.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.418
And those watch hands
that light up

19:11.451 --> 19:13.320
in the dark are also made
of uranium.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.356
Oh, yeah? I'd really like
to have one of those.

19:16.390 --> 19:18.559
You can't see this one
in the dark.

19:18.793 --> 19:20.828
So we're going on
a secret mission

19:20.862 --> 19:22.496
in a German U-boat
so that Roosevelt

19:22.530 --> 19:24.197
can tell the time at night?

19:25.733 --> 19:27.200
It'll be used to build a bomb.

19:28.603 --> 19:30.505
And not just any bomb,
but one that can raze

19:30.538 --> 19:32.406
a city to the ground.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.842
Destruction radius
of a few kilometers.

19:35.643 --> 19:37.845
The Germans have
their top scientists

19:37.879 --> 19:40.748
working on it.
The Americans can't lag behind.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.719
The Shinkolobwe mines
owned by the Union here in Congo

19:44.752 --> 19:47.287
are the biggest source
of uranium in the world,

19:47.320 --> 19:49.691
and Roosevelt
has purchased a few tons

19:49.724 --> 19:52.192
in alliance
with the Belgian government.

19:54.028 --> 19:56.296
- We just have to get it there.
- Yup.

19:58.599 --> 20:00.501
We've got to pilot
this ourselves?

20:01.169 --> 20:03.303
You'll get three weeks
of training.

20:03.638 --> 20:05.840
Theory and practice,
that's not a lot.

20:05.873 --> 20:07.542
So start studying,

20:07.575 --> 20:09.677
'cause this is one exam
you can't afford to fail.

20:09.711 --> 20:12.914
Right, on deck. 15 minutes.

20:15.583 --> 20:17.819
So we're nothing
but a bunch of chauffeurs.

20:17.852 --> 20:20.888
Yeah, well,
this is one hell of a limo.

20:22.790 --> 20:25.593
Can you do that somewhere else?
Like behind a curtain?

20:25.626 --> 20:28.428
Don't be such a child.
I'm sweating like a pig.

20:28.462 --> 20:30.031
Yeah, Stan.

20:30.064 --> 20:31.899
It's not like we've never seen
her in the raw before.

20:37.872 --> 20:41.441
I mean, not in a sexual way
or anything, right?

20:42.210 --> 20:44.812
No, like when she was washing
in that stream.

20:44.846 --> 20:47.414
Totally, totally innocent, Stan.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.783
And from far away.

20:48.816 --> 20:50.952
Real far. We couldn't see.

20:50.985 --> 20:53.286
We could only see
with binoculars.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.655
You perverts!

21:11.371 --> 21:14.776
Hey, blimey. Where'd you get
this bloody thing?

21:14.809 --> 21:15.977
Confidential.

21:17.512 --> 21:19.346
Right. Well...

21:20.380 --> 21:23.316
Right, come on you! One Kraut.

21:24.051 --> 21:25.052
As ordered.

21:25.086 --> 21:26.319
Thank you.

21:27.088 --> 21:28.656
What's this?

21:29.824 --> 21:33.426
Franz Jager, a German captain.
He's going to train us.

21:33.928 --> 21:35.997
If you think I'm going
to America with a Nazi,

21:36.030 --> 21:37.598
then you need to think again.

21:37.632 --> 21:39.901
It's just for training,
I'm the captain.

21:39.934 --> 21:43.037
He was the commander of a U-boat
from '14 to '18.

21:43.070 --> 21:46.073
He knows U-boats
inside and out. Stan!

21:47.608 --> 21:49.476
You thinking what I'm thinking?

21:50.044 --> 21:52.479
But there aren't
any bathtubs on board.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.488
Good morning, gentlemen.

22:01.522 --> 22:03.423
I've been instructed
to teach you

22:03.456 --> 22:06.493
how to operate this U-boat
in three weeks.

22:07.128 --> 22:09.063
Well, this is impossible.

22:12.133 --> 22:15.736
It's tantamount to suicide.

22:16.571 --> 22:19.774
It takes highly intelligent
German officers

22:19.807 --> 22:21.509
at least 12 months.

22:22.109 --> 22:24.612
But since I will not be going
with you,

22:24.912 --> 22:27.014
I sincerely don't give a shit.

22:27.215 --> 22:30.818
And so, we have the front
of the boat, the bow.

22:30.852 --> 22:33.154
This is the front torpedo room.

22:33.187 --> 22:35.923
We have four torpedo tubes.

22:36.724 --> 22:40.695
Torpedoes. Very heavy.
Over 1,000 kilograms each.

22:41.128 --> 22:43.430
But this is no concern to you

22:43.463 --> 22:45.800
because you will not shoot
a torpedo.

22:46.234 --> 22:48.669
Men, this is
a transport mission,

22:48.703 --> 22:50.470
not an attack mission.

22:50.504 --> 22:52.640
Oh, yeah? And if we have
to defend ourselves, what then?

22:52.673 --> 22:53.908
We dive then.

22:55.176 --> 22:59.647
Toilet, captain's cabin,
officers' beds.

23:01.015 --> 23:02.415
Officers' mess.

23:02.984 --> 23:03.951
Woah!

23:04.451 --> 23:06.354
Here, the radio room.

23:06.687 --> 23:08.890
This is a 200-watt transmitter.

23:10.791 --> 23:14.061
Command room,
this is the heart of the boat.

23:14.095 --> 23:16.163
From here, the captain decides
about everything

23:16.197 --> 23:17.832
except the tides.

23:18.498 --> 23:21.102
From here, he decides
about life and death.

23:25.573 --> 23:27.141
Sleeping quarters.

23:27.174 --> 23:29.510
You share them in two shifts.

23:29.543 --> 23:32.546
As you can see, we have plenty
of space on board.

23:33.648 --> 23:35.016
The galley.

23:35.783 --> 23:37.685
Second important room.

23:38.586 --> 23:40.054
Keep the cook your friend.

23:40.087 --> 23:42.723
You might as well get started
on the potatoes.

23:42.757 --> 23:45.059
Woo!

23:46.193 --> 23:47.828
The machine room.

23:47.862 --> 23:49.597
Diesel?

23:49.630 --> 23:51.799
Diesel on the surface,
electric underwater.

23:51.832 --> 23:53.567
Twelve hundred
horsepower at least!

23:53.601 --> 23:55.903
Three thousand
two hundred, actually.

23:56.304 --> 23:59.040
Motorenwerke Mannheim,
best machines ever built.

23:59.073 --> 24:00.841
This puts my dad's tractor
to shame!

24:00.875 --> 24:02.176
Still far to go?

24:03.778 --> 24:05.880
This is
the aft torpedo room,

24:05.913 --> 24:07.615
the last room on the boat.

24:07.648 --> 24:09.183
Here we have
two electric engines.

24:09.750 --> 24:12.954
One torpedo,
and one torpedo tube.

24:14.055 --> 24:18.192
Well, these are the basics.

24:18.693 --> 24:22.196
As you can see,
this is a highly complex

24:22.229 --> 24:24.131
and sophisticated machine.

24:24.165 --> 24:26.901
One wrong move and...

24:27.601 --> 24:28.903
Jesus!

24:29.437 --> 24:32.940
And so, you men had better
brace yourself.

24:32.974 --> 24:34.909
You've got three weeks
to learn it.

24:39.814 --> 24:41.849
Okay, job assignments.

24:42.216 --> 24:44.819
Stan, as first officer,
you ensure my orders

24:44.852 --> 24:45.886
are carried out.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.922
Tamme, Klisse, the engines.

24:47.955 --> 24:49.957
Werner, radio and sonar.

24:49.991 --> 24:51.726
Filip and Fons, steering.

24:51.759 --> 24:55.529
Van Praag, trim tanks. Okay?
Come on, time for class.

24:55.563 --> 24:57.098
And me? I don't have a job.

24:58.099 --> 25:00.201
Why don't you tell her?

25:00.901 --> 25:02.069
What?

25:02.536 --> 25:04.538
I've made some arrangements.

25:05.339 --> 25:09.143
Um, when they deliver
the uranium,

25:09.643 --> 25:12.880
you'll be taken to a nearby
plantation by the delivery boat.

25:13.214 --> 25:14.682
It'll be safer there.

25:14.715 --> 25:16.017
You can't just leave me
in Africa,

25:16.050 --> 25:17.318
if you think I'm going to...

25:17.351 --> 25:19.053
You're not going
in this bloody coffin.

25:23.190 --> 25:24.692
An U-boat crew has to work

25:24.725 --> 25:27.028
like a well-oiled machine,
together.

25:27.628 --> 25:30.598
You all know the phrase
"one for all, all for one?"

25:31.332 --> 25:33.734
On an U-boat,
this is not just a phrase.

25:35.036 --> 25:36.170
This is reality.

25:38.172 --> 25:41.208
Pulley... Pulley system.
Pulley system pulley.

25:41.242 --> 25:42.676
This wheel here,

25:42.710 --> 25:44.311
- it aims the hydrophone.
- The hydrophone.

25:45.813 --> 25:48.949
This here is
the main transmitter control,

25:48.983 --> 25:50.718
and this button here...

25:50.751 --> 25:53.054
Changes the frequency
to broadband communication.

25:54.755 --> 25:56.657
And that's the receiver.

26:08.302 --> 26:10.871
Guys, this manual is just
too complicated.

26:10.905 --> 26:13.074
It's too complicated,
and in German!

26:41.235 --> 26:42.870
Yeah!

26:47.842 --> 26:50.177
To dive, the air is blown out
of the ballast tanks

26:50.211 --> 26:51.912
which fill the water.

26:51.946 --> 26:54.181
And to surface,
it's the opposite.

26:54.215 --> 26:55.950
The water is pumped out

26:55.983 --> 26:58.786
and it fills with air
under high pressure. Got it?

27:00.321 --> 27:03.390
And if you're underwater
and you have to do a number two,

27:03.424 --> 27:04.959
and you flush it,

27:04.992 --> 27:06.727
does the shit go
to the ballast tank

27:06.760 --> 27:07.995
or straight into the sea?

27:08.028 --> 27:09.763
- What?
- That's stupid.

27:09.797 --> 27:12.166
No, that's not
a stupid question.

27:12.199 --> 27:15.269
If you don't send it out
in the water, it could...

27:16.070 --> 27:19.340
Is there something wrong
with your stomach? Oh?

27:28.048 --> 27:30.217
- You going in?
- No.

27:30.751 --> 27:33.320
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Suit yourself.

27:38.325 --> 27:40.928
Short, short,
short, long...

27:41.962 --> 27:45.933
Shot, short, short
and long...

27:47.368 --> 27:49.370
And what does that mean?

27:49.403 --> 27:50.838
You...

27:51.172 --> 27:53.841
Have really beautiful...

27:55.976 --> 27:57.044
tits.

27:59.947 --> 28:01.182
You're an idiot.

28:01.682 --> 28:03.918
Is that all you learned
in class?

28:05.319 --> 28:06.921
The only thing I remember.

28:09.323 --> 28:11.091
It's our last night together.

28:14.228 --> 28:16.330
Maybe I can make him
change his mind.

28:17.364 --> 28:19.033
No, he won't budge.

28:21.802 --> 28:23.971
He also got Mama
to leave without me.

28:30.077 --> 28:31.478
- Hey?
- Hm?

28:31.912 --> 28:34.481
At least we can say
goodbye properly.

28:34.516 --> 28:36.784
Yeah, that's true.

29:16.957 --> 29:18.959
Jenga, toss the rope!

29:29.470 --> 29:31.472
What, you got something
against blacks?

29:31.506 --> 29:33.173
I just don't want
the banana man touching me,

29:33.207 --> 29:34.241
you know?

29:34.275 --> 29:35.809
It doesn't stick.

29:35.843 --> 29:37.144
I don't want to talk about it.

29:51.425 --> 29:53.494
Alright, come on, men.
Let's get started, come!

30:13.013 --> 30:15.949
- I just need a minute.
- Easy, careful with it.

30:31.198 --> 30:34.301
That chocolate ape is just being
too lazy to make two trips.

30:34.335 --> 30:35.369
That's all.

30:53.555 --> 30:56.123
<i>They are still here
at the same coordinates.</i>

30:57.559 --> 30:59.326
<i>We're approaching
from the west.</i>

30:59.360 --> 31:01.161
<i>You must not allow them
to submerge</i>

31:01.195 --> 31:02.530
<i>until we have arrived.</i>

31:02.731 --> 31:04.231
What's up?

31:04.264 --> 31:05.899
- It's a German radio message.
- What?

31:05.933 --> 31:08.202
- Here?
- Well, it's VHF

31:08.235 --> 31:11.105
- and that's line of sight.
- Huh?

31:11.138 --> 31:13.440
Well, these radio waves
can't pass through trees

31:13.474 --> 31:15.175
or over mountains, so this ship

31:15.209 --> 31:17.545
is less than 100 kilometers
from here.

31:17.579 --> 31:19.880
Alright, find the signal again.

31:25.152 --> 31:26.286
- Maes!
- What?

31:26.320 --> 31:27.354
There are ships!

31:27.388 --> 31:28.623
- Where?
- There!

31:34.161 --> 31:36.930
Damn it! We got to get
out of here.

31:36.964 --> 31:38.432
To America or what?

31:38.465 --> 31:40.535
But they're coming our way,
we have no choice.

31:40.568 --> 31:42.369
Oh, but all that we've had
is theory!

31:42.403 --> 31:43.937
Practice starts now. Go!

31:43.971 --> 31:45.038
Come on, men, hurry up!

31:45.072 --> 31:47.441
Come on, come on!

31:50.678 --> 31:52.112
What's happening?
What's all the commotion?

31:52.146 --> 31:53.947
We're leaving now!

31:54.248 --> 31:55.617
We're going to America!

31:55.650 --> 31:57.619
Not knowing how to dive?
And where do I go?

31:57.652 --> 31:59.219
You're coming with us.

31:59.253 --> 32:01.188
- But that wasn't the deal!
- New deal!

32:01.488 --> 32:03.023
For God's sake,
think for a moment!

32:03.323 --> 32:05.492
You have zero percent chance
of survival.

32:05.527 --> 32:08.362
It's suicide, and I think
you know that very well.

32:08.395 --> 32:10.197
I don't have any alternative.

32:13.701 --> 32:15.102
What?

32:16.538 --> 32:18.138
<i>They've seen you.</i>

32:18.172 --> 32:20.140
<i>The boat is preparing
to leave, over!</i>

32:20.174 --> 32:22.109
<i>Okay, understood.</i>

32:22.142 --> 32:24.478
<i>We are in range now,
twenty minutes. Out.</i>

32:24.846 --> 32:26.548
<i>Okay, understood.</i>

32:31.418 --> 32:33.086
Yes, understood.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.556
- Everything is on board.
- Hey!

32:35.690 --> 32:37.157
Oh, shit!

32:40.027 --> 32:41.261
Dammit!

32:50.204 --> 32:52.272
Bloody hell! Look!
The Kraut killed him!

32:54.642 --> 32:57.377
I didn't mean to do it.
That was not my intention!

33:00.347 --> 33:01.749
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

33:01.783 --> 33:03.651
What in the hell
are you doing, Stan?

33:03.685 --> 33:05.085
We still need him!

33:05.653 --> 33:07.522
Who else is going
to pilot the boat?

33:10.457 --> 33:11.559
Jeez!

33:15.128 --> 33:16.396
Get us out of here.

33:18.666 --> 33:20.334
Come on!

33:26.206 --> 33:28.075
Keep moving!

33:30.845 --> 33:33.347
I'll have to hold onto this
for the old man.

33:36.350 --> 33:38.218
Can I come along, or are you
still sending me off

33:38.252 --> 33:39.621
with the collaborator?

33:39.654 --> 33:41.355
Stop moaning. Is that it?
Is everyone below?

33:41.388 --> 33:42.790
No.

33:48.328 --> 33:50.163
That nigger isn't coming?

33:50.197 --> 33:51.733
No, Fons, we dumping him
in the sea.

33:51.766 --> 33:53.467
- Take him aft.
- Let's go.

33:53.501 --> 33:55.202
Start the engines!

34:04.478 --> 34:05.412
Engines ready!

34:07.649 --> 34:09.382
Let's go!

34:14.889 --> 34:17.824
Rudder 3-10.
Set course to 3-10.

34:18.659 --> 34:20.695
Starboard main rudder, 20.

34:25.465 --> 34:27.768
I want both machines
to proceed slowly.

34:27.802 --> 34:29.536
Both engines slow ahead.

35:02.604 --> 35:04.338
We don't have enough pressure!

35:07.174 --> 35:08.442
- The main valve's half open!
- What?

35:08.475 --> 35:10.344
The main valve's only half open!

35:10.377 --> 35:11.613
Well, then go open it!

35:11.646 --> 35:12.880
Give me a break!

35:13.548 --> 35:15.850
You mind if I get through, mate?

35:17.819 --> 35:20.153
I don't see anything changing!

35:20.187 --> 35:21.321
Yeah, hang on!

35:28.495 --> 35:29.831
It's starting to rise!

35:29.864 --> 35:31.633
The levers are starting to move!

35:31.666 --> 35:34.702
Tamme! We've got reinforcements!

35:34.736 --> 35:36.470
Jenga machinist.

35:37.739 --> 35:39.641
- <i>Qui, qui!</i>
- Welcome aboard!

35:50.785 --> 35:52.152
Well?

35:53.286 --> 35:54.722
They're still far away,

35:54.756 --> 35:56.758
but it's best
if we stay out of sight.

35:57.391 --> 35:59.159
Take us down.

36:02.764 --> 36:04.632
Alright, everyone.
Prepare to dive.

36:04.666 --> 36:06.868
Set your depth to 30 meters.

36:06.901 --> 36:08.235
Huh?

36:09.704 --> 36:11.806
Front open ten, back open five.

36:13.574 --> 36:15.543
- Five degrees down bubble.
- Yeah.

36:16.911 --> 36:19.379
- Five down.
- Down.

36:20.414 --> 36:21.549
Yeah.

36:22.116 --> 36:24.351
Flood it. Open main valve.

36:28.890 --> 36:30.858
You, open main vents.

36:41.869 --> 36:43.705
Cut the diesel,
switch to electric.

36:43.738 --> 36:45.338
Both engines slow ahead.

36:52.379 --> 36:53.681
Switching over!

37:55.375 --> 37:56.778
We're under the water.

37:56.811 --> 37:58.679
Just like Jules Verne.

37:59.180 --> 38:02.415
The boat is very special, Jenga.

38:02.950 --> 38:05.052
Under water,
not on it, under it.

38:35.616 --> 38:37.518
Take them off. I need my hands.

38:39.754 --> 38:41.656
I'll take them off
when I trust you.

38:42.590 --> 38:44.391
Right after you stop breathing.

38:47.728 --> 38:49.664
What guarantee do I have
that you won't kill me

38:49.697 --> 38:51.532
as soon as we dock in New York?

38:52.200 --> 38:54.769
What guarantee do I have
you won't kill everyone

38:54.802 --> 38:56.737
before we even get there?

38:57.738 --> 38:59.372
About the same amount.

38:59.807 --> 39:00.975
Stan?

39:01.742 --> 39:02.944
Stan?

39:08.549 --> 39:10.585
Listen. Listen to this.

39:11.152 --> 39:13.120
It's a strange droning noise.

39:18.893 --> 39:20.094
They're looking for us.

39:28.903 --> 39:31.371
As long as we stay under,
there's no problem.

40:09.911 --> 40:11.746
Now, which was it?

40:17.218 --> 40:18.819
I don't remember anymore.

40:34.035 --> 40:35.736
Oh, my God!

40:37.571 --> 40:39.840
A leak in the crapper!

40:40.341 --> 40:43.577
Damn it, you idiots. Do I have
to do everything myself?

40:45.846 --> 40:48.950
You incompetent fool!
Are you trying to kill us?

40:49.717 --> 40:51.652
F7, B5,

40:52.553 --> 40:57.758
L6, C3, B1!

40:58.926 --> 41:00.661
Is that so hard to remember?

41:00.695 --> 41:02.964
I'm going to shove your C3
and your B5

41:02.997 --> 41:04.265
down your bloody throat!

41:04.298 --> 41:06.767
Listen. Do you know
which compartment

41:06.801 --> 41:08.202
lies right under the toilet?

41:08.235 --> 41:10.738
The battery compartment.
Batteries and water,

41:10.771 --> 41:12.907
this is a very bad combination!

41:15.710 --> 41:17.545
Let him go.

41:21.682 --> 41:23.150
Ha! If pigs had wings...

41:29.957 --> 41:30.992
Shit!

41:34.595 --> 41:36.797
Chlorine gas.
Blow the ballast tanks!

41:36.831 --> 41:38.766
Ascend! Hurry, go, go!

41:38.799 --> 41:41.035
Is the plane gone? Hey!

41:41.068 --> 41:42.837
If we don't vent this boat
in thirty seconds,

41:42.870 --> 41:44.138
we'll be gone!

42:02.156 --> 42:03.624
Use the flak!

42:05.726 --> 42:07.595
Damn it, he's banking away!

42:10.064 --> 42:11.799
Why isn't he attacking?

42:12.199 --> 42:13.601
He won't risk an attack

42:13.634 --> 42:15.169
while we're aiming
the flak at him.

42:15.202 --> 42:18.205
He'll circle us. Out of reach
until we're diving.

42:18.539 --> 42:20.941
A diving submarine
is target practice

42:20.975 --> 42:22.276
for the Luftwaffe.

42:22.309 --> 42:23.644
Well, then we won't dive.

42:24.145 --> 42:26.247
He has to run short
of fuel sometime.

42:26.280 --> 42:28.082
He's already on the radio.

42:29.150 --> 42:30.718
More are coming.

42:47.068 --> 42:48.202
Hurry!

43:00.948 --> 43:02.149
Close the hatch! Flood it!

43:02.183 --> 43:04.251
Dive, dive, dive!
Hurry up, men!

43:13.961 --> 43:15.129
Oh, shit!

43:27.341 --> 43:28.876
Bloody hell, he got him!

43:34.915 --> 43:36.183
Stan!

43:37.051 --> 43:38.252
Stan!

43:40.154 --> 43:41.322
Stan!

43:55.236 --> 43:56.704
Lucky bastard.

44:11.352 --> 44:13.053
You sleep here, right?

44:13.821 --> 44:15.689
Huh? Go ahead.

44:19.126 --> 44:20.327
Go ahead.

44:23.497 --> 44:25.266
That's not going
to happen.

44:26.300 --> 44:29.436
Who said that this darkie
was going to sleep in here?

44:29.470 --> 44:31.472
Yeah, well, Jenga
has worked ten times harder

44:31.506 --> 44:32.806
than you, fatso.

44:35.042 --> 44:37.378
- Go sleep in the torpedo room.
- Come off it, Fons.

44:47.855 --> 44:49.223
Get going.

44:52.459 --> 44:54.261
Yes, sir.

44:59.767 --> 45:00.968
And take your fish with you.

45:13.914 --> 45:15.149
No!

45:18.485 --> 45:22.156
Uncle Kriechbaum is going
to give you a bath, huh?

45:22.557 --> 45:25.759
Splishy, splashy!
Get your little tootsies wet.

45:26.794 --> 45:29.096
Look how happy he is.

45:32.433 --> 45:34.536
Please don't hurt him.

45:34.569 --> 45:38.339
I think daddy's going
to save you now.

45:40.874 --> 45:42.276
Isn't he?

45:42.309 --> 45:45.212
They're upstairs
behind the fireplace.

45:45.246 --> 45:46.747
Go look.

45:49.316 --> 45:56.023
In nature, sometimes the size
of a particular population

45:56.056 --> 45:57.858
has to be corrected

45:58.125 --> 46:04.164
so that a natural equilibrium
can be reestablished.

46:04.898 --> 46:08.035
And that is what
we take care of.

46:08.637 --> 46:14.141
We are merely restoring
balance in nature

46:14.174 --> 46:16.110
once again.

46:19.581 --> 46:23.551
And it is so important
for him

46:23.984 --> 46:27.955
that he learns about balance.

46:29.256 --> 46:30.224
So long!

46:30.257 --> 46:32.226
No! No, no, please!

46:32.259 --> 46:35.129
No, don't go!
Don't leave him like that!

46:35.396 --> 46:36.864
Please no!

46:43.203 --> 46:44.872
No!

46:44.905 --> 46:47.274
No! No!

46:50.010 --> 46:53.847
No! No! No, please!

46:53.881 --> 46:57.351
No! No! No!

46:59.086 --> 47:00.954
Please, help!

48:28.342 --> 48:30.077
This cannot be right.

48:34.582 --> 48:36.984
What are you doing
fifty degrees off course?

48:38.452 --> 48:41.054
Coming back
from ninety degrees.

48:41.088 --> 48:42.189
What?

48:42.857 --> 48:46.160
What? What can I do about it,
you wiener schnitzel?

48:46.193 --> 48:48.128
This is supposed
to be Filip's job!

49:13.020 --> 49:16.056
Your little shepherd's nap
just cost us eight hours!

49:21.729 --> 49:23.464
What are you up to?

49:26.033 --> 49:28.469
Checking the shafts.
They need some oiling.

49:39.647 --> 49:41.982
Woah, woah, Stan!
No, go easy, stop!

49:42.550 --> 49:44.084
Calm down!

49:44.819 --> 49:46.253
No! No!

49:46.788 --> 49:48.322
Open tube five!

49:59.299 --> 50:01.803
Ah, a Chinese volunteer
for the torpedo test?

50:01.836 --> 50:03.470
Just help me!

50:03.505 --> 50:05.372
Sorry, I only listen
to my captain!

50:05.405 --> 50:06.608
So help me, then!

50:12.446 --> 50:14.582
You've made your point,
now let me live my own life!

50:14.616 --> 50:16.416
He should keep his paws
off your body!

50:16.450 --> 50:18.285
It's my body
and it's my business!

50:18.318 --> 50:20.053
You're still much too young
for all that!

50:20.087 --> 50:21.589
How old do I have to be

50:21.623 --> 50:23.357
before Mr. Almighty
give his permission? Forty?

50:23.725 --> 50:25.560
When you're married,
then you can do what you want.

50:25.593 --> 50:27.261
For now,
you must do what I say!

50:27.695 --> 50:29.564
Hm. Okay, I agree.

50:31.398 --> 50:33.233
Well, a captain
can marry people.

50:34.836 --> 50:36.069
Come.

50:40.307 --> 50:43.277
Captain? We're having a wedding.

50:46.548 --> 50:48.181
Come on, guys.

50:49.617 --> 50:52.687
Come on, gentlemen.
The bride is waiting.

51:04.231 --> 51:06.233
No Bible, so this
will have to do.

51:08.770 --> 51:10.705
I don't think
this is a good idea.

51:14.241 --> 51:16.143
Put your hands
on the... Bible.

51:17.210 --> 51:19.514
Nadine, do you want to take

51:19.547 --> 51:21.883
this man, Filip,
as your lawfully wedded husband?

51:21.916 --> 51:22.850
I do.

51:24.418 --> 51:26.888
And Filip, do you want to take
this woman, Nadine,

51:26.921 --> 51:28.790
as your lawfully wedded wife?

51:33.761 --> 51:35.697
- I...
- Jager!

51:35.730 --> 51:37.364
No! Ignore him!

51:41.468 --> 51:44.304
Damn it. Let's get in!

51:44.739 --> 51:46.608
Now! Move, move, move!

51:46.641 --> 51:48.576
Move! Hurry up!

51:48.610 --> 51:50.377
They might have
an U-boat escort.

51:52.446 --> 51:53.815
Come on, move!

52:02.389 --> 52:03.725
- Hey.
- Go away.

52:05.927 --> 52:07.394
You know...

52:07.427 --> 52:09.429
We can hardly hold
a wedding party

52:09.463 --> 52:11.365
with an enemy ship in the area.

52:11.398 --> 52:12.867
You could've said
"I do" ten times

52:12.900 --> 52:14.334
before Stan spotted it.

52:14.368 --> 52:15.435
But he was breathing down
our necks.

52:15.469 --> 52:16.771
So what?

52:20.474 --> 52:23.310
Isn't it much better to wait
until we're in America?

52:24.846 --> 52:26.881
I love you, you know that.

52:27.615 --> 52:29.349
But Stan...

52:29.383 --> 52:31.552
- It's just not easy for him.
- He's just a bastard.

52:35.657 --> 52:37.859
Mama would react
completely differently.

52:41.596 --> 52:44.766
You have no idea how much
I am looking forward to the day

52:45.066 --> 52:47.401
that I will see her again.

52:49.436 --> 52:52.573
The day I can introduce you
to her as...

52:52.607 --> 52:54.374
as my husband.

52:58.813 --> 53:00.447
She'll be so proud.

53:10.490 --> 53:12.192
Hey, what's the matter?

53:16.764 --> 53:17.932
Hey...

53:44.625 --> 53:45.893
Hey?

53:48.963 --> 53:50.765
Your mother, she...

53:52.466 --> 53:53.735
What?

54:00.407 --> 54:01.909
She's dead, Nadine.

54:03.477 --> 54:05.580
Your mother is dead, I saw her.

54:08.616 --> 54:10.417
Louis, too.

54:10.450 --> 54:12.754
But what are you saying?
They're safe in France.

54:13.453 --> 54:14.622
No...

54:17.959 --> 54:19.326
What?

54:20.628 --> 54:22.362
Stan has...

54:22.395 --> 54:24.464
Well, he's tried to tell you
a hundred different times

54:24.498 --> 54:25.900
the truth, but...

54:25.933 --> 54:28.435
How do you as a father,
tell your daughter

54:29.170 --> 54:31.973
that her mother's dead
and her brother's dead, too?

54:34.108 --> 54:36.611
He couldn't bear to see you
falling to pieces

54:36.644 --> 54:37.879
in front of him.

54:39.379 --> 54:40.782
I'm sorry.

54:42.049 --> 54:43.584
I'm sorry.

54:47.655 --> 54:48.890
Torpedo!

54:50.591 --> 54:52.593
Alarm, goddamn it!

54:53.060 --> 54:55.696
Torpedo, course 2-2-3,
five hundred meters!

54:55.963 --> 54:58.465
To your stations!
Fifteen down bubble!

54:58.498 --> 55:00.001
Move! Come on!

55:01.368 --> 55:03.070
- Go, go, go, go!
- Shit!

55:03.104 --> 55:05.773
Go, go! Dive, dive!

55:12.713 --> 55:13.748
Prepare for impact!

55:21.689 --> 55:23.423
Two hundred meters!

55:30.430 --> 55:31.599
Fifty meters!

55:31.899 --> 55:33.100
Brace for impact.

55:47.114 --> 55:48.649
They missed!

55:48.683 --> 55:50.383
Hey, they missed!

55:50.417 --> 55:51.919
Be quiet! Silence!

55:53.988 --> 55:55.857
Both engines to full stop.

55:55.890 --> 55:57.625
Silent mode, I repeat,
silent mode.

56:02.597 --> 56:04.565
Absolute silence.

56:31.893 --> 56:34.662
Adjust 20 starboard.

56:46.007 --> 56:47.074
Well?

56:47.508 --> 56:49.010
Nothing just yet.

56:52.780 --> 56:54.181
Can't find him.

56:54.982 --> 56:57.484
He's somewhere behind us.

56:59.520 --> 57:00.855
Come with me.

57:02.890 --> 57:03.925
Klisse.

57:09.864 --> 57:12.066
You have the manual
with the technical plans

57:12.099 --> 57:13.601
of the torpedoes?

57:13.634 --> 57:15.169
Uh, yes, it's in the...

57:15.202 --> 57:17.939
Good, good, go.
Get it. Addendum C.

57:17.972 --> 57:21.008
Go to the aft torpedo room,
cut the wires to four and five

57:21.042 --> 57:22.910
of the aft torpedo, quickly.

57:24.879 --> 57:26.681
But be careful.

57:26.714 --> 57:28.983
Only the wires four and five.
Don't touch the others.

58:39.120 --> 58:41.088
What is that?
Shut the damn thing off!

58:41.622 --> 58:44.058
Start the engines!

59:03.844 --> 59:05.246
How is it coming
with the torpedo?

59:05.813 --> 59:08.115
- We're working on it!
- Come on!

59:08.517 --> 59:09.950
He's behind us!

59:14.789 --> 59:16.323
- Load aft torpedo.
- Come on, guys!

59:16.357 --> 59:17.691
Yeah!

59:17.725 --> 59:19.860
Come on! Hurry!

59:23.764 --> 59:24.965
Got it!

59:28.769 --> 59:31.105
- Distance?
- Four hundred meters!

59:31.138 --> 59:32.673
Bearing?

59:32.706 --> 59:34.875
One, eight, zero,
right behind us.

59:34.909 --> 59:36.710
It's now or never.

59:37.111 --> 59:39.013
Is the aft torpedo loaded?

59:39.680 --> 59:41.816
- Done!
- Okay, okay!

59:41.849 --> 59:43.250
Come on! Come on!

59:50.758 --> 59:52.359
It's jammed!

01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:02.770
What's going on? Shit!

01:00:03.104 --> 01:00:05.339
Help me move it! Jenga!

01:00:08.676 --> 01:00:10.411
Come on! Come on!

01:00:15.584 --> 01:00:17.251
Help me get him out!

01:00:19.086 --> 01:00:20.688
Hold it right there!

01:00:28.295 --> 01:00:30.264
I need that damn torpedo,
right now!

01:00:33.767 --> 01:00:35.202
Tube five ready!

01:00:35.236 --> 01:00:36.670
Shoot those Krauts!

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.975
What are you waiting for?

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:43.744
Shoot it!

01:00:44.945 --> 01:00:45.980
Go!

01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:07.868
Brace for impact.

01:01:14.475 --> 01:01:17.478
Torpedo! 100 meters!

01:01:17.512 --> 01:01:20.047
- Speed 40 knots!
- Left rudder! Come on!

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:21.782
Too late for that.

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:26.020
Fifty meters!

01:01:28.022 --> 01:01:29.190
And now?

01:01:29.524 --> 01:01:32.059
- Pray.
- Ten meters!

01:01:47.041 --> 01:01:48.275
What happened?

01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:50.110
We were too close.

01:01:50.144 --> 01:01:52.279
They did not cut the minimum
safety distance mechanism.

01:01:54.215 --> 01:01:55.416
We did.

01:02:43.998 --> 01:02:45.232
Damage report!

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:48.936
The propulsion is broken!

01:02:48.969 --> 01:02:50.304
The rudder won't move!

01:02:50.337 --> 01:02:52.172
Can we surface?

01:02:52.206 --> 01:02:53.575
The tanks!

01:02:53.608 --> 01:02:54.842
Surface!

01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:16.263
Hey, guys. Um...

01:03:17.364 --> 01:03:18.899
Van Praag...

01:03:19.366 --> 01:03:21.835
Van Praag's not looking good.

01:03:35.015 --> 01:03:37.151
Alright, have a drink, buddy.

01:03:39.219 --> 01:03:40.555
Come on.

01:03:53.434 --> 01:03:55.002
Drink up, mate.

01:03:57.572 --> 01:04:00.374
- There's no other option.
- Yeah, I know.

01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:02.176
What?

01:04:08.048 --> 01:04:10.618
What? Are you crazy?
Don't ask me!

01:04:10.652 --> 01:04:12.286
You're the only one of us
with any experience!

01:04:12.319 --> 01:04:15.155
Yeah, with cows and with pigs!

01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:16.624
Shh, Fons!

01:04:16.658 --> 01:04:19.026
If you don't do it,
he's going to die, Fons.

01:04:19.493 --> 01:04:22.162
You can't ask me to do that.
I won't do that!

01:04:25.299 --> 01:04:26.568
Give me any Kraut you want,

01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:28.503
and I'll saw off his leg
or an arm,

01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:30.270
or any other part you want.

01:04:30.904 --> 01:04:33.173
But not Van Praag. Not that guy!

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.409
I could never look him
in the eye again.

01:04:35.442 --> 01:04:38.312
I could never do that to him!
Sorry, guys.

01:04:38.345 --> 01:04:41.048
- Come on, Fons. You can do it.
- I just can't do it.

01:04:41.583 --> 01:04:43.016
No.

01:04:46.253 --> 01:04:48.188
Tamme, out of the way.

01:04:59.366 --> 01:05:01.569
Stop it, Klisse.
I'm going to puke.

01:05:01.603 --> 01:05:03.937
No, man. Come on,
drink some more, drink.

01:05:03.971 --> 01:05:05.640
You need to drink,
for your own good.

01:05:05.673 --> 01:05:08.108
What do you mean?
What are you going to do?

01:05:08.142 --> 01:05:10.444
No! Just hold him down,
hold him still!

01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:15.315
Stop!

01:05:20.522 --> 01:05:23.725
Uh, can you just
tie of his leg

01:05:23.758 --> 01:05:25.392
- above the knee?
- Yeah.

01:05:25.426 --> 01:05:27.529
The rest, hold him down.

01:05:27.562 --> 01:05:29.163
Then start sawing at his knee.

01:05:29.196 --> 01:05:30.532
- Like this? Here?
- Yep.

01:05:30.565 --> 01:05:31.965
Come on.

01:05:31.999 --> 01:05:33.367
We need to fix this boat.

01:05:34.134 --> 01:05:35.603
Jenga, Tamme.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:37.672
Alright, fine. Go on!

01:05:37.705 --> 01:05:39.674
- Hold him for me!
- Yeah, okay.

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:44.411
Come on, guys.

01:05:44.445 --> 01:05:46.013
Is everyone ready?

01:05:46.046 --> 01:05:47.715
- Come on, guys.
- Let's do it.

01:05:51.084 --> 01:05:52.419
Come on, come on!

01:05:59.493 --> 01:06:01.462
Come on, now,
you can do it!

01:07:03.858 --> 01:07:06.193
Just so you can work better
on the engines.

01:07:10.163 --> 01:07:11.733
I understand.

01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:23.243
It had to be done.
You saved his life.

01:07:27.682 --> 01:07:29.316
He'll never play football again.

01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:33.655
Another talent wasted.

01:07:36.323 --> 01:07:38.392
All the big clubs
were after him.

01:07:40.494 --> 01:07:42.162
He could've picked any team.

01:07:44.666 --> 01:07:45.733
Yes.

01:07:50.304 --> 01:07:52.139
You played football?

01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:58.211
No. Always been a soldier
as long as I can remember.

01:08:04.786 --> 01:08:06.420
And a soldier doesn't pick
his own team.

01:08:24.538 --> 01:08:25.640
Oh, shit!

01:08:27.942 --> 01:08:29.777
Werner, the radio!

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:41.421
- German destroyer.
- Can we get away?

01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:42.890
Not fast enough!

01:08:42.924 --> 01:08:44.658
- We've only got one engine.
- What do we do?

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.260
If we move now
just half a meter

01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:48.529
without identifying ourselves,

01:08:48.563 --> 01:08:50.397
they'll open fire
with the deck gun.

01:08:51.298 --> 01:08:53.734
Stan! Stan!

01:08:54.868 --> 01:08:55.903
Come.

01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:04.578
<i>This is Captain Max Schultz.</i>

01:09:04.612 --> 01:09:06.613
<i>Identify yourselves, over!</i>

01:09:06.648 --> 01:09:07.582
Go on.

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:11.184
This is Captain Franz Jager,

01:09:11.218 --> 01:09:13.688
U-235. 8th fleet.
What's up, over?

01:09:14.622 --> 01:09:16.390
<i>Eighth fleet?</i>

01:09:16.423 --> 01:09:18.392
<i>You're miles
out of your zone, over!</i>

01:09:19.926 --> 01:09:21.696
We had a little rendezvous
with a mine

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:24.363
and want to repair
the damage, over.

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:26.834
<i>A mine?</i>

01:09:26.868 --> 01:09:29.737
<i>We'll send you some mechanics,
perhaps they can help you, over.</i>

01:09:30.604 --> 01:09:33.305
Thank you, but that
won't be necessary.

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.943
We've got everything here
well under control, over.

01:09:37.511 --> 01:09:40.380
<i>It's no trouble.
We'd be glad to help you.</i>

01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:43.450
<i>We're waiting for orders,
anyway, over.</i>

01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:47.354
Okay, come over. We've got
some whiskey for you, out.

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:51.390
What do you think
you're doing, you bastard?

01:09:52.093 --> 01:09:54.796
They're suspicious if we don't
let them on board.

01:09:54.829 --> 01:09:57.364
And if they're suspicious,
they open fire.

01:09:58.566 --> 01:10:00.702
You have to surrender.

01:10:01.569 --> 01:10:03.236
We can't surrender.

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:05.305
You guys, goddamn it,
they've lowered a boat!

01:10:08.676 --> 01:10:10.812
Okay, you take your mate
with you.

01:10:10.845 --> 01:10:12.980
Nadine, off to the toilet.

01:10:13.014 --> 01:10:16.283
Fons, go back there!

01:10:18.653 --> 01:10:20.454
You do the talking.

01:11:00.728 --> 01:11:02.462
Well, comrades...

01:11:02.496 --> 01:11:03.965
You chose some real shit weather
for your little visit,

01:11:03.998 --> 01:11:05.465
don't you think?

01:11:05.499 --> 01:11:07.502
You can say that again.

01:11:11.773 --> 01:11:12.807
Comrades.

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:18.311
So you had a collision
with a mine?

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.448
Yeah, we have some damage,
but you know how it is.

01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:24.351
It's an U-boat, there's always
something to repair.

01:11:24.384 --> 01:11:25.686
But that can wait.

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.354
Not the whiskey.

01:11:27.387 --> 01:11:29.557
- This way.
- That's a good idea.

01:11:31.692 --> 01:11:33.895
Apparently, there's
a rogue U-boat in the area.

01:11:37.598 --> 01:11:40.367
On the way to the States
with a cargo of uranium.

01:11:41.401 --> 01:11:43.070
We have to keep our eyes open.

01:11:44.572 --> 01:11:46.007
Uranium, you say?

01:11:46.373 --> 01:11:47.742
Yeah.

01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:51.512
I don't even know
what it is.

01:11:51.846 --> 01:11:53.948
It seems to be something
very important.

01:11:53.981 --> 01:11:55.583
Very important?

01:11:58.152 --> 01:11:59.954
Whatever the case,

01:11:59.987 --> 01:12:02.723
that is something that's way
above our paygrade, right?

01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:12.767
- Come on, the whiskey's waiting.
- Lead the way.

01:12:41.596 --> 01:12:43.396
- Fons.
- Shh.

01:12:45.833 --> 01:12:47.434
Are we there yet?

01:12:47.467 --> 01:12:49.402
Shh, there's
some Germans on board.

01:12:49.904 --> 01:12:51.572
Oh, I've got an itch.

01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:53.908
I got to scratch
my right foot,

01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:54.942
it itches like hell.

01:12:56.644 --> 01:12:58.012
Scratch it for me.

01:12:58.045 --> 01:12:59.647
It's like it's crawling
with ants.

01:13:08.656 --> 01:13:09.690
Like that?

01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.860
That's nice.

01:13:17.698 --> 01:13:20.067
- <i>Prost!</i> Cheers.
- <i>Prost.</i>

01:13:25.239 --> 01:13:27.541
Some damn good whiskey, Jager.

01:13:27.575 --> 01:13:28.643
Well, I told you so.

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:31.145
How long have you been here?

01:13:31.178 --> 01:13:32.880
For quite some time now.

01:13:32.914 --> 01:13:34.682
We're just waiting
for our new orders,

01:13:34.715 --> 01:13:36.050
but, uh...

01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:38.085
That's... That's alright,
this is Gerhardt.

01:13:38.119 --> 01:13:40.755
He's... He's just coming around.

01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:44.692
Quiet!

01:13:45.626 --> 01:13:47.194
For God's sake, shut up!

01:13:50.665 --> 01:13:53.668
He had an accident.
We had to operate.

01:13:54.735 --> 01:13:56.469
I can take a look, I guess.

01:13:56.504 --> 01:13:58.471
Don't worry about it,
he's in excellent hands.

01:13:58.506 --> 01:14:00.541
Mayer was a medic,
perhaps he can help.

01:14:01.876 --> 01:14:03.177
Go take a look.

01:14:06.247 --> 01:14:08.481
How about
another round, huh?

01:14:10.685 --> 01:14:12.720
Be quiet. Come on!

01:14:27.268 --> 01:14:29.670
You had to amputate both legs?

01:14:30.304 --> 01:14:32.006
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

01:14:33.607 --> 01:14:35.576
How and when did it happen?

01:14:36.978 --> 01:14:38.713
Eh... <i>ja.</i>

01:14:44.719 --> 01:14:45.920
<i>Ja.</i>

01:14:49.023 --> 01:14:50.791
The only thing
I can do is...

01:14:51.659 --> 01:14:53.027
Give him some morphine.

01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:54.862
<i>Ja.</i>

01:14:54.895 --> 01:14:56.564
I'll go get it and come back.

01:14:57.164 --> 01:14:59.533
I want my legs back!

01:14:59.767 --> 01:15:01.302
Where did my legs go?

01:15:01.335 --> 01:15:04.672
Alarm! Alarm!
These men aren't Germans!

01:15:05.639 --> 01:15:07.141
They aren't Germans!

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.554
No, no, no, no!

01:15:30.164 --> 01:15:33.534
No! No! No!

01:15:35.236 --> 01:15:36.737
No!

01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:40.574
No! No! No!

01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:58.686
I've uh, witnessed
a scientific experiment

01:16:58.719 --> 01:17:00.221
once on a Jew.

01:17:01.722 --> 01:17:04.825
The man was strapped
in a tub of ice water.

01:17:05.893 --> 01:17:07.194
Zero degrees.

01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:12.199
When he was about
to die after

01:17:13.434 --> 01:17:15.936
five hours
of horrendous agony,

01:17:17.438 --> 01:17:19.707
they reheated his body

01:17:20.674 --> 01:17:25.212
by irrigating boiling water
into his stomach,

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:31.285
his intestines...
and his bladder.

01:17:34.188 --> 01:17:35.422
Your cargo...

01:17:36.123 --> 01:17:37.158
uranium...

01:17:37.691 --> 01:17:40.694
I've heard rumors about it.

01:17:41.362 --> 01:17:42.830
In the rumors it was referred to

01:17:42.863 --> 01:17:44.832
as a weapon
of mass destruction.

01:17:48.736 --> 01:17:50.838
I've seen what they can do
with an ordinary tub

01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:52.273
of cold water.

01:17:53.407 --> 01:17:54.875
Imagine what they can do

01:17:54.909 --> 01:17:56.744
with a weapon
of mass destruction.

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:05.152
I've closed my eyes once.

01:18:07.021 --> 01:18:09.390
But I won't make this mistake
a second time.

01:18:11.492 --> 01:18:16.096
God help us if Hitler
is first to make this weapon.

01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:24.004
So...

01:18:26.473 --> 01:18:28.876
Let's get this boat
out of here.

01:18:40.487 --> 01:18:42.790
Shit, they're getting impatient.

01:18:46.927 --> 01:18:48.996
They're demanding their crew
to return immediately.

01:18:49.029 --> 01:18:50.431
Hurry up!

01:18:50.464 --> 01:18:53.100
Their deck gun is aiming
straight at us. Hurry!

01:18:56.403 --> 01:18:58.038
Are you sure?

01:18:58.072 --> 01:18:59.406
It's an impossible shot.

01:19:01.175 --> 01:19:02.409
You can do it.

01:20:11.011 --> 01:20:13.347
Now, dive, dive!
Open valves.

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:14.982
Go, go, go, go!

01:20:15.249 --> 01:20:18.819
Move! Go, everybody!
Come on!

01:20:19.887 --> 01:20:21.355
It's only a fuse.

01:20:21.388 --> 01:20:22.923
Give me 10 seconds.

01:20:27.194 --> 01:20:29.396
It's only a fuse,
only a fuse.

01:20:30.331 --> 01:20:32.534
There we go! Alright, let's go.

01:20:32.567 --> 01:20:35.469
Shh, listen! What is that?

01:20:35.503 --> 01:20:37.271
What is that?

01:20:41.676 --> 01:20:43.243
Grab hold of something!

01:21:08.936 --> 01:21:10.437
Seal the hatch!

01:21:24.151 --> 01:21:25.119
Nadine!

01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:44.071
We need to close
the hatch

01:21:44.104 --> 01:21:45.540
or we're all going to die!

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.441
Come, come, come!

01:21:47.474 --> 01:21:48.510
Klisse!

01:21:50.411 --> 01:21:51.613
Klisse!

01:21:52.112 --> 01:21:54.047
We need to close it now!

01:21:54.081 --> 01:21:55.282
I'm stuck!

01:21:58.653 --> 01:22:01.155
Come on, Klisse! Come on!

01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:04.224
Klisse!

01:22:04.258 --> 01:22:06.226
Klisse, the hatch
must be closed!

01:22:50.638 --> 01:22:53.407
To the bay!
Come, right now! Let's go!

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:56.009
- What are you waiting for?
- Come on, man!

01:22:56.343 --> 01:22:58.178
Come on! Klisse!

01:22:59.112 --> 01:23:00.715
Let's go! Move!

01:23:01.783 --> 01:23:03.217
Klisse, come on!

01:23:29.644 --> 01:23:30.778
Come on, this way!

01:23:43.123 --> 01:23:44.659
Nadine! Nadine!

01:23:44.692 --> 01:23:46.728
Damn it! No, no, no!

01:23:51.231 --> 01:23:53.166
Nadine!

01:23:53.735 --> 01:23:55.302
Open the door!

01:23:55.335 --> 01:23:58.138
Help! Help!

01:24:12.219 --> 01:24:14.856
It's your liver.
It's gone right through.

01:24:14.889 --> 01:24:17.224
- Take this.
- Thanks.

01:24:38.746 --> 01:24:40.748
Come on, you can do it!

01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:49.591
There must be something
we can do!

01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:04.739
Nadine is locked in!

01:25:09.209 --> 01:25:12.245
Calm down, calm down!
Just don't panic!

01:25:12.714 --> 01:25:15.382
Please, please! Please!

01:25:24.191 --> 01:25:25.225
Hey!

01:25:29.731 --> 01:25:31.766
Do you hear that? That's him!

01:25:35.670 --> 01:25:37.805
This is impossible.
He will kill himself.

01:25:41.475 --> 01:25:42.810
What did he say?

01:25:42.844 --> 01:25:44.478
Your father is coming!

01:25:47.347 --> 01:25:49.617
Don't do it! It's suicide!

01:25:51.552 --> 01:25:53.888
I'm not going to let
another child drown, Fons!

01:26:12.774 --> 01:26:14.709
- Ready?
- Alright!

01:26:55.382 --> 01:26:57.417
Stay calm!

01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:05.472
No pulse.

01:30:08.809 --> 01:30:09.944
Come on!

01:30:13.948 --> 01:30:15.448
Come on, baby!

01:30:32.733 --> 01:30:34.035
Come on, baby!

01:30:34.969 --> 01:30:36.537
Come on!

01:30:38.506 --> 01:30:40.074
Come on! Do your best!

01:30:40.107 --> 01:30:42.209
Come on, that's it.

01:30:42.243 --> 01:30:44.111
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:30:52.987 --> 01:30:54.454
Come on, darling!

01:30:54.956 --> 01:30:57.058
Come on!
Fight for it, come on!

01:31:04.632 --> 01:31:06.200
For Christ's sake, come back!

01:31:06.233 --> 01:31:08.970
For once in your life,
listen to me! Fight!

01:31:09.971 --> 01:31:11.572
Wake up!

01:31:13.274 --> 01:31:15.109
Stan, stop.

01:31:28.255 --> 01:31:29.657
Stan...

01:31:30.191 --> 01:31:31.826
Let her go.

01:31:34.095 --> 01:31:35.162
No!

01:31:59.954 --> 01:32:02.823
Nadine, you're back with us.

01:32:08.329 --> 01:32:10.865
Oh, thank God.

01:32:25.179 --> 01:32:27.581
He's, uh... She's...

01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:31.052
They're in the back...

01:32:31.085 --> 01:32:33.954
Oh, bloody hell! They did it!
She's still alive!

01:32:45.132 --> 01:32:47.068
We're almost
in America, comrades.

01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:58.012
There is no other way.

01:32:58.045 --> 01:32:59.747
You know this
is a one-way ticket, right?

01:33:00.247 --> 01:33:03.050
I presumed it the very first
moment I set foot on this boat.

01:33:14.361 --> 01:33:15.896
Wait, wait.

01:33:18.766 --> 01:33:19.800
Here...

01:33:22.803 --> 01:33:25.306
Sorry... We, um...

01:33:37.985 --> 01:33:39.253
Thank you.

01:34:54.094 --> 01:34:57.064
Don't let her wait so long
the next time...

01:34:58.465 --> 01:34:59.800
for an answer.

01:35:06.407 --> 01:35:07.875
I promise.

01:35:12.514 --> 01:35:13.881
Okay.

01:35:44.011 --> 01:35:45.446
Bloody hell, he did it!

01:36:15.242 --> 01:36:17.211
Mama... and Louis...

01:36:17.244 --> 01:36:18.846
Papa.

01:36:19.413 --> 01:36:21.849
If you couldn't save them,
nobody could.

01:37:11.365 --> 01:37:12.534
You have him.

01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:15.936
Damn, you're right. Checkmate!

01:37:17.037 --> 01:37:19.440
Bloody hell!

01:37:19.473 --> 01:37:20.974
Come off it!

01:37:24.178 --> 01:37:25.212
Hey!

01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:30.451
Hi there, sweety!

01:37:31.218 --> 01:37:32.986
- Let's go swim.
- <i>We interrupt</i>

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.421
<i>this program
for a special statement</i>

01:37:34.455 --> 01:37:36.023
<i>by President Truman.</i>

01:37:36.423 --> 01:37:40.294
<i>A short time ago,
an American airplane</i>

01:37:40.327 --> 01:37:43.163

01:37:43.197 --> 01:37:45.933

01:37:46.266 --> 01:37:51.171
<i>That bomb has more power
than 20,000 tons of TNT.</i>

01:37:51.539 --> 01:37:54.041
