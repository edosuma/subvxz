00:03.437 --> 00:05.038
Is it just me,
or did that speaker use

00:05.038 --> 00:07.708
the words "impact"
and "impactful" constantly?

00:07.708 --> 00:10.110
And if impactful is really
a word, it's barely a word.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.411
(both laugh)

00:11.411 --> 00:13.247
Sorry that was so boring.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.982
Well, I had a great time.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.618
And there are
735 ceiling tiles
in the ballroom.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.553
I only counted 734.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.655
-Well, you clearly missed one.
-(giggles)

00:21.655 --> 00:24.057
-There's one in the corner
that you didn't even see.
-Oh. Oh, okay.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.559
-It's easy to miscount.
I understand.
-I know.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.095
Anyway, thank you for coming.

00:28.095 --> 00:29.997
I asked Brock to come, but...

00:29.997 --> 00:32.266
-Is it the same hotel
as last year?
-Yeah.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.567
Then I'm there.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.636
They've got those
genius birds in the lobby.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.237
Brraaaaak!

00:37.237 --> 00:40.107
Babe! It's saying my name!

00:40.107 --> 00:41.141
Oh honey, I'm sorry.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.176
They took out the birds.

00:43.176 --> 00:46.380
Oh! I just remembered.
I'm busy.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.151
But he's training
for a really big meet,

00:51.151 --> 00:52.286
-so--
-Audrey!

00:52.286 --> 00:53.620
Hey! Lauren!

00:53.620 --> 00:54.755
Hi!

00:54.755 --> 00:58.225
Lauren, this is Kevin.
She's in this group, too.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.193
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

01:00.193 --> 01:02.362
Well, I'm gonna head to the bar.
Can I get you anything to drink?

01:02.362 --> 01:04.998
-Oh. I'll take the wine.
Thanks!
-Okay.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.400
Oh, you guys!
Get together for a picture.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.401
-Oh.
-Yeah.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.437
(phone clicks)

01:10.437 --> 01:13.040
Aww, cute.
I'm gonna post it.

01:13.040 --> 01:17.678
Post away and I will be back
with your drink specials.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.346
Like I'm a wa--
I'm a waiter.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.248
I'm... I'm gonna go.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.184
-He's adorable.
-I know.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.285
I saw you guys
during the presentation.

01:25.285 --> 01:26.520
You're such a cute couple.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.554
Oh, no.

01:27.554 --> 01:29.556
No, no, no, no, no,
that's not my boyfriend.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.258
That's Kevin from work.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.026
We are just friends.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.127
Great.

01:34.127 --> 01:35.262
Can I go out with him?

01:35.262 --> 01:37.064
Sure.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.532
Okay.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.234
<i>♪ Oh!</i>
<i>Whoo, whoo, whoo ♪</i>

01:41.234 --> 01:43.670
Well, we're happy
to have you here.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.640
We're gonna have
a clutch kind of day.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.477
-So, I'm gonna
pick her up at 5:00.
-Okay.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.613
Wait, wait. You mean
like in five, right, Kev?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.214
No.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.249
Roxie, it's time to accept
that you're working now, okay?

01:56.249 --> 01:58.185
We all have to make
sacrifices to pay the rent.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.586
Ugh. Rent.

01:59.586 --> 02:02.222
God, I can't wait to stop
working here once I pay it.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.724
Rent needs to
be paid every month.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.225
Ugh!

02:05.225 --> 02:08.295
I'm sorry, but you know,
the days of you being lazy

02:08.295 --> 02:11.331
while everything just magically
works out for you are over.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.599
Ooh! Look! A $20.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.634
-Wow.
-Are you serious?

02:15.202 --> 02:17.237
She's all yours.
I'm so sorry.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.206
-Cool.
-Ow.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.141
He hits me on the back
just as hard.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.209
I get it. Come here.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.210
Let's go. Come here.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.545
So this is my domain, okay?

02:25.545 --> 02:27.280
We call it the "gyum."

02:27.280 --> 02:28.482
G-Y-U-M.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.283
He's cute.
What's his deal?

02:30.283 --> 02:31.318
Huh?

02:31.318 --> 02:33.186
Oh, that's Christopher.

02:33.186 --> 02:34.688
Yeah, he's an actor.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.722
He's here every single day.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.058
Dedicated.
That's what you're gonna be.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.693
So he's an actor,
but he's here?

02:39.693 --> 02:42.996
And he's working out,
but he's not working?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.231
I could do that.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.232
It's not as easy as it looks.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.333
You can't just be an actor.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.135
Well, you believed that
I was actually gonna work

02:48.135 --> 02:49.302
here today,
so I think that I already am.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.504
Why are you taking
your clothes off?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.205
Thank you so much.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.342
(funky music playing)

02:55.342 --> 02:56.309
I don't get it.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.078
Impactfulness is a word.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.346
So is impacted.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.480
Don't ask me how
I know that one.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.682
It was just funny.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.183
You had to be there.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.452
Well, I would have been,
but nobody invited me.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.254
I was very busy anyway.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.689
I drove my sister
to the pharmacy.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.290
We picked out pressure socks.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.225
I feel like a dancer.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.595
-(crashing)
-Hey!

03:15.595 --> 03:17.064
Ooh! Sorry.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.967
So, I had fun last night,

03:20.967 --> 03:22.636
hanging out outside of work.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.405
You're not the only one
who had fun last night.

03:25.405 --> 03:26.707
So did Lauren.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.275
Who?

03:28.275 --> 03:29.743
Nice to meet you.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.411
Lauren: (muffled)
Nice to meet you, too!

03:31.411 --> 03:32.746
(majestic music playing)

03:32.746 --> 03:34.247
She wants to go out with you.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.383
Oh. Really?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.617
Zero pressure.

03:37.617 --> 03:40.053
I mean,
I figured you maybe weren't...

03:40.053 --> 03:44.124
you know,
emotionally available just yet.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.158
Who, me?

03:45.158 --> 03:47.294
No, I am though.
Emotionally available.

03:47.294 --> 03:50.363
And physically available,
for that matter.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.099
But I'm physically available
even when I'm not

03:52.099 --> 03:53.433
emotionally available,
which I am now.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.035
So yes, I will go out
with your friend.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.671
Yes. Happy to. Proud to.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.739
Yes.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.075
Out we shall go!

04:02.075 --> 04:03.110
-Great!
-Yeah.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.678
I'll forward you
Lauren's contact info.

04:04.678 --> 04:08.081
Good. Good stuff.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.616
Oh, look. There she is.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.285
Lauren...
She's pretty, too.

04:13.453 --> 04:16.056

So, I'm-- I'm asking out
this girl that I'm told

04:38.078 --> 04:39.412
I met at a conference.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.314
I figured I can't keep pining
over Audrey forever, you know?

04:41.314 --> 04:43.416
It's time to show her
I moved on, right?

04:43.416 --> 04:45.485
Hell yeah.
Good for you.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.753
Show Audrey, "Excuse me,

04:46.753 --> 04:49.189
I got things going on
you don't even know about."

04:49.189 --> 04:51.391
-Audrey introduced us.
<i>-Aw, dude.</i>

04:51.391 --> 04:53.026
You've got to do
more for your own self.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.295
Maybe I already did
help my own self, you know?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.463
Maybe she's
the perfect girl for me.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.665
-Who knows?
-Patti: <i>Hi. Excuse me...</i>

04:58.665 --> 05:00.400
-Who's that?
-Brian: <i>Listen, I've gotta go.</i>

05:00.400 --> 05:01.434
-I gotta go.
-Excuse me?

05:01.434 --> 05:03.403
-Excuse me? Excuse me?
-Yeah?

05:03.403 --> 05:05.438
-Hi. I'm looking for Roxie.
-Hi.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.706
She said she was
tricked into working here.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.376
Oh. She left early today...

05:09.376 --> 05:11.411
and she's never coming back.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.512
Uh, what?

05:12.512 --> 05:14.414
I was supposed to
meet her here to hang.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.316
She gave me a free pass.

05:17.384 --> 05:20.320
"Patti's free gym coupon.
Please admit one Patti."

05:22.322 --> 05:23.690
Yeah, I'll honor this.
Um...

05:23.690 --> 05:25.192
You want to stay to train?

05:25.192 --> 05:27.627
Hmm... no.
These people look sweaty,

05:27.627 --> 05:29.296
and I don't like sitting
on anything wet

05:29.296 --> 05:30.697
unless I know where
the moisture is coming from.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.399
-Yeah.
-Besides, my dad said

05:32.399 --> 05:34.601
that if I want a trainer,
he'd pay for one to come to me.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.337
Oh, hey! I-- I'll come
to your house and train you.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.606
-You're Kevin's friend, right?
-Yeah.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.708
He and I hit a bit
of a rough patch,
as you may have heard.

05:41.708 --> 05:45.145
He definitely used "rough"
as a word to describe it.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.479
Okay, fine.

05:46.479 --> 05:49.216
Meet me at my place
Monday morning, 11:00 sharp.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.517
Wait. Monday? Don't you work?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.419
I do not, sir.
How dare you.

05:53.553 --> 05:56.223
Dude, nice one.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.457
Chad:
"In-home training session?"

05:57.457 --> 06:00.594
More like in-bone
training session, right?

06:00.594 --> 06:02.529
Ho, yeah.
Forget the exercise.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.231
Get to the sexercise!

06:04.231 --> 06:07.367
It's not like that, fellas, no.
She just wants to be trained.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.169
Dude. Are you
kidding me right now?

06:09.169 --> 06:10.337
You gotta hit that--

06:10.337 --> 06:12.172
just like I did
with that woman, Donna,

06:12.172 --> 06:13.640
for a solid year
at her place.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.108
You remember her?

06:15.108 --> 06:18.612
Hot, blond, older,
a little fat, kinda bad skin,

06:18.612 --> 06:20.380
weird hands, bad breath?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.415
-Mmm.
-That's cool. That's cool.

06:22.415 --> 06:26.987
Um... Thank you for
the insider tip, guys.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.356
You've never done it before,
have you?

06:29.356 --> 06:31.057
Slept with an in-home.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.727
-Well, maybe-- maybe I have.
-Nah.

06:33.727 --> 06:38.331
If he had, he would
have made some puns
after he said "insider tip."

06:38.331 --> 06:40.367
Listen, we're your friends,

06:40.367 --> 06:41.668
but if you come back
from a house call

06:41.668 --> 06:45.405
without sealing the deal,
our puns will be turned on you.

06:45.405 --> 06:52.245
Yeah? Like, "Uh-oh, here comes
the in-house train...er wreck."

06:54.180 --> 06:56.549
-No.
-I wasn't feeling it, either.

06:56.549 --> 06:57.517
I don't know
where that came from.

06:57.517 --> 06:59.119
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

07:00.453 --> 07:03.023

This was such a good idea.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.090
I know!

07:04.090 --> 07:05.659
Okay, now let's take
a picture with the tacos.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.760
-Oh. Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.261

07:08.261 --> 07:09.729

07:09.729 --> 07:12.666
Okay, now let's do one smooshed
together with everyone in line.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.700
-Great!
-Yeah!

07:13.700 --> 07:15.001
Just pretend like you know us!

07:15.001 --> 07:16.436
Kevin:
No? Okay.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.405
-Now you.
-Hmm? Oh.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.673
(phone clicks)

07:19.673 --> 07:21.408
-Oh. Oh, no, no.
-No?

07:21.408 --> 07:23.043
-Not a silly face.
-Not...

07:23.043 --> 07:24.311
Can you do handsome?

07:24.311 --> 07:25.345
(scoffs)

07:25.345 --> 07:26.713
-Can I do handsome?
-Huh?

we're hot, we can't be stopped!

08:04.117 --> 08:07.554
We've got the fever,
we're hot, we can't be stopped!

08:07.554 --> 08:09.255
Kill him, Damien!

08:09.255 --> 08:11.691
Rip his face off!
Shove it down his throat!

08:12.692 --> 08:13.727
(phone dings)

08:13.727 --> 08:16.596
Geez. How many things
can you do in two days?

08:16.596 --> 08:19.265
Announcer:
<i>And the winner--</i>
<i>Brock Estrada!</i>

08:19.265 --> 08:21.001
(cheering and applause)

08:21.001 --> 08:22.435
(laughs)

08:22.435 --> 08:24.004
Hey, babe!

08:25.538 --> 08:27.540
Did you see
my upward lift escape?

08:27.540 --> 08:29.542
Yeah. That was a good one.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.144
Freakin' regal.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.079
You ready to go to
the after-party with your champ?

08:33.079 --> 08:35.715
Sure.
I'm so proud of you.

08:35.715 --> 08:38.651
Great! Bozzy and Grinder--
they wanna do pickle-back
shots in their garage.

08:38.651 --> 08:40.353
-Oh.
-Yeah. Oh!

08:40.353 --> 08:41.521
Hey! Wait up, guys!

08:42.622 --> 08:44.024
(phone dings)

08:45.025 --> 08:47.127
Okay, give it a rest.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.696
(funky music playing)

08:49.696 --> 08:52.032
(laughs)
Thank you!

08:52.032 --> 08:54.601
Oh...

08:54.601 --> 08:55.502
Sorry, ladies.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.404
You're all super pretty
and everything,

08:57.404 --> 09:00.407
but I just
frickin' nailed it in there.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.608
You got the part?

09:01.608 --> 09:03.643
Well, they told me
I did a great job, so...

09:03.643 --> 09:05.311
Later, basics.

09:05.311 --> 09:07.013
-(clattering)
-Boom.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.617
Sit down, sweetie.

09:10.617 --> 09:11.651
She didn't get it.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.253
They tell everybody that.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.056
I'm just saying, man,
be careful with Patti.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.525
She's very vengeful and strong.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.226
Brian:
<i>I know what I'm doing, Kevin.</i>

09:20.226 --> 09:21.694
Kevin:
<i>All right. Then just do it.</i>

09:21.694 --> 09:23.296
(scoffs)
Maybe I will.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.498
Hey, look, don't...
don't pressure me, okay?

09:25.498 --> 09:26.733
I get enough of that
from the guys at work.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.401
<i>Okay. Look,</i>
<i>I, uh, I gotta hang up.</i>

09:28.401 --> 09:30.203
Lauren asked me to bring
a seven-layer salad

09:30.203 --> 09:31.971
to this pot-luck murder mystery
we're going to,

09:31.971 --> 09:33.673
<i>and I still gotta send a photo</i>

09:33.673 --> 09:35.375
and one fun fact
about myself to the host.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.443
<i>Oh, that's easy, Kev.</i>

09:36.443 --> 09:38.344
You make a great
seven-layer salad.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.514
Which is also your fun fact.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.349
-Hmm.
<i>-Okay, I gotta go.</i>

09:44.551 --> 09:46.453
(exhales deeply)

09:46.453 --> 09:47.487
(funky music playing)

09:49.522 --> 09:51.391
Hey, girl.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.625
<i>♪ Whoo ♪</i>

09:52.625 --> 09:54.360
Ready to sweat?

09:54.360 --> 09:57.197
Yeah. We're working out,
aren't we?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.998
We... we're working out, girl.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.667
That's why I know
you called me over.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.470
To do all kinds
of working out.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.671
Ain't that right, girl?

10:04.671 --> 10:06.339
Why do you
keep calling me "girl?"

10:06.339 --> 10:07.740
Don't be that way, girl.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.476
Okay, ew.
You're acting gross.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.510
I hired you to train me

10:10.510 --> 10:12.445
and this is
not very professional.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.280
Ain't that what
you wanted though?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.249
For you and I to work out...

10:16.249 --> 10:17.450
(grunts)

10:17.450 --> 10:19.085
...hard?

10:19.085 --> 10:20.353
You're fired.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.122
-Get out.
-Okay, hold on...
Look, I'm sorry.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.656
Look, I'm just doing
what they told me to do at work.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.725
Who from work told you
to do what, when, and why?

10:25.725 --> 10:30.163
Brian... poor, sweet,
impressionable Brian.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.198
Those guys are
making that stuff up.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.600
They're not having sex
with their clients.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.635
But they have all those puns
to back it up.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.170
Trust me. They're not.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.440
-Pizza delivery guys.
Extra sausage.
-Nope.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.675
-Pool boys?
Un-clog your filter?
-No. Never.

10:42.675 --> 10:45.278
-Massage therapists--
-Oh, that one's true.
But it is pricier.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.379
Okay, so what do I tell 'em?

10:46.379 --> 10:48.581
Tell 'em you want
a happy ending.

10:48.581 --> 10:49.749
Hm?

10:49.749 --> 10:51.618
No, you little freak nasty.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.685
I'm talking about
the guys at the gym.

10:52.685 --> 10:55.655
Mm... Let's work on that.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.323
(funk music playing)

10:57.323 --> 10:58.558
Hey, Kevin.

11:00.126 --> 11:02.362
I saw Lauren's Instagrams.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.630
All of them.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.698
Looks like you've been
hanging out a lot.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.167
That's good, right?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.368
Oh, yeah. It's great.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.636
You know, it's the first
weekend in forever

11:09.636 --> 11:13.740
where I haven't just
passed out watching TV
on my baby bed.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.176
I mean, my normal,
man-sized bed.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.211
(gasps)

11:19.279 --> 11:20.747
Those must be from Brock.

11:20.747 --> 11:25.084
I sewed two championship patches
on his black shirt thing.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.619
You Kevin Daily?

11:26.619 --> 11:27.687
Yeah.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.088
These are for you.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.590
Oh. Wow.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.560
Oh! They're from Lauren.
(laughs)

11:33.560 --> 11:35.695
I can't believe
she did it.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.698
Uh... inside joke.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.167
Lauren and I were making
this social comment
on how the man

11:41.167 --> 11:43.336
is always supposed
to buy the flowers.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.271
I love that
she just went for it.

11:45.271 --> 11:46.606
-(phone dings)
-Ooh!

11:48.174 --> 11:49.742
Oh, my God.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.477
-From Lauren?
-Yeah.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.346
Not safe for work.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.616
-All right.
-Oh.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.085
Oh, by the way,

11:59.085 --> 12:01.454
I realized we messed up
on the Dreyerson report

12:01.454 --> 12:03.723
-and should really stay late
tonight to fix it.
-Sure.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.559
Maybe even work
on the weekend, too.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.229
You know, hopefully
that doesn't impact

12:09.229 --> 12:10.630
your plans with Lauren.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.664
(chuckles)

12:11.664 --> 12:14.067
"Impact." Whoa.
Am I right?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.969
Oh, yeah,
joke from the other day.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.437
Funny. I get it.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.306
You know, who knows
what I'm going to miss
tonight with Brock.

12:20.306 --> 12:24.644
We have been doing
tons of fun stuff together.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.112
Tons.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.580
(rock music playing)

12:29.415 --> 12:30.750
Eight.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.553
(cheering)

12:33.553 --> 12:34.754
-Whoo!
<i>-Uno más.</i>

12:34.754 --> 12:36.155
But we gotta work.

12:36.155 --> 12:37.390
Huge bummer.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.700
I had to basically
force Kevin to stay late

12:47.700 --> 12:49.002
with me to finish our work.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.070
Like he absolutely has to go
to the Santa Monica pier

12:51.070 --> 12:54.073
with Lauren to play Skee-Ball
and win her a giant Minion?

12:54.073 --> 12:55.742
Do I detect a little jealousy?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.511
I have Brock.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.713
I'm not jealous
of Kevin and Lauren.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.483
I think you're jealous
of the fun they're having.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.984
Maybe.

13:04.984 --> 13:06.686
Just... Brock and I used
to have a blast together.

13:06.686 --> 13:09.289
That's one of the reasons
why I fell in love with him.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.991
Now it's like all
of our free time is spent

13:11.991 --> 13:14.127
at these jiujitsu meets,
which are the worst.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.664
I don't know,
maybe I am jealous.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.033
Look, if you want to have
more fun with Brock,

13:20.033 --> 13:22.402
then just make what
Brock's doing more fun.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.038
Those pageants where
they karate chop each other
or whatever.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.740
Other people certainly seem
to be having a good time.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.975
Yeah.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.977
And if you can't make
a good time out of a bunch

13:30.977 --> 13:32.612
of giant, sweaty guys
rolling around on a mat,

13:32.612 --> 13:35.448
then honestly,
we shouldn't even be roommates.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.154

13:48.995 --> 13:51.230
Oh! I just did
sprawled on the hood.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.266
Now I'm thinking, like,
a soapy sponge series.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.735
Who-- Whose car is this?

13:55.735 --> 13:57.370
It's mine.
I bought it.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.205
Yeah. I'm an actor now
on a crime show.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.540
Huh. Which one?

14:00.540 --> 14:02.308
I don't know.
But I'm sure they'll tell me

14:02.308 --> 14:04.077
when they call
with the good news
that I got it.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.045
I had an audition
and everything.
Don't you read my tweets?

14:06.045 --> 14:09.015
An audition is
not a job, okay?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.149
You need to take this back.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.751
No, Kevin.
I'm keeping it.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.120
I'm going to get that part
because I believe in myself,

14:14.120 --> 14:16.055
not settle
for some stupid gym job.

14:16.055 --> 14:19.525
Listen, I'm destined
for something greater.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.128
A role that I'm not sure about,
on a show with a title

14:22.128 --> 14:23.429
that I haven't learned yet.

14:23.429 --> 14:26.032
So take a lesson from me.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.133
Don't settle.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.435
(scoffs)
I am not settling.
I don't settle.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.237
If I was settling,
I wouldn't be about to drive

14:31.237 --> 14:32.739
to the City of Commerce
right now to see

14:32.739 --> 14:35.141
if my zoot suit is ready
for an all-day speakeasy crawl

14:35.141 --> 14:36.576

14:52.759 --> 14:55.628
Brian, thank you so much
for the in-home training

14:55.628 --> 14:56.763
and for respecting
my boundaries

14:56.763 --> 14:59.065
and keeping it
completely professional.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.434
I knew he wouldn't
be able to seal the deal.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.603
Seal what deal, Brian?

15:03.603 --> 15:06.038
Well, Patti, when these guys
in-home train a client--

15:06.038 --> 15:08.174
You mean in-bone train.

15:08.174 --> 15:11.144
Oh, yeah!
All aboard that train!

15:11.144 --> 15:12.011
(both imitating trains)

15:12.011 --> 15:14.147
Oh, I see what you're implying.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.349
And you guys do this
with all of your female clients?

15:16.349 --> 15:19.519
All the ones who just want
to do one sit up...

15:19.519 --> 15:20.987
at the end.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.622
Oh! Got 'em!

15:22.622 --> 15:24.724
Brian, could you please
have Ms. Thompson

15:24.724 --> 15:26.592
-approach the weight bench?
-Mm-hmm.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.665
That's him.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.734
-Patti: Are you sure?
-Ms. Thompson: Yes. I'm sure.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.336
That's the man
who never slept with me.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.005
I knew you never did it.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.673
What? Shut up, dude.
You never did it!

15:40.673 --> 15:43.176
You guys are sentenced
to 30 minutes on the dread-mill.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.243
Ooh! I just did a pun.

15:44.243 --> 15:47.079
-Please don't undercut
everything I've done here.
-Okay.

-You know?

15:53.386 --> 15:55.188

15:57.523 --> 16:00.493

16:00.493 --> 16:02.528
Just my beer.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.034
-Now it's free.

Why? It was frickin' hilarious!

-Oh, you're laughing-- Good.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.486
This is my crew.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.088
We've got Trisha,
Tasha, Krystal with a "K,"

16:29.088 --> 16:31.057
and Crystal Light
'cause she's much skinnier

16:31.057 --> 16:33.192
than Fat Crystal
who we just call Crys.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.327
We're the JiuJitsu girls.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.495
Or the JJs.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.997
When our men are winning,
we're the Victorious JJs.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.098
The VJJs.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.701
Wow. Okay.
That's-- that's--

16:41.701 --> 16:43.469
Damien, get your head
in the game!

16:43.469 --> 16:44.737
Domesticate him!

16:46.172 --> 16:47.206
(can clicks open)

16:47.206 --> 16:49.075
Audrey.

16:49.075 --> 16:49.976
Thank you.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.116
-(chugging)
-(girls cheer)

16:58.518 --> 17:00.019
Get it, Audrey!

17:01.153 --> 17:02.989
(funky music playing)

17:02.989 --> 17:05.391
That was the best
underground cigar club

17:05.391 --> 17:08.194
in a waffle house jazz brunch
I've ever been to.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.063
-On to the next place!
-Okay...

17:11.063 --> 17:13.099
On to a bait shack
in San Pedro

17:13.099 --> 17:15.334
for soft cheese
and champagne tasting.

17:15.334 --> 17:18.170
-40 minutes away.
-Yay.

17:18.170 --> 17:21.240
-Current traffic...
two hours and six minutes.
-Hm.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.441
You know what?
Why don't we just go

17:22.441 --> 17:24.076
to like, a nice little
diner or something?

17:24.076 --> 17:26.345
We can just sit
and talk and hang out.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.314
I feel like we just haven't
gotten to know each other yet.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.217
Yeah. That sounds nice.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.385
Let's make
a Snap story about it!

17:32.385 --> 17:33.519
(squeals)

17:33.519 --> 17:34.620
(phone beeps)

17:34.620 --> 17:37.123
(chants)
You say, "Diner,"
I say, "Boring."

17:37.123 --> 17:39.158
-Diner.
-Boring!

17:39.158 --> 17:40.593
-Diner.
-Boring!

17:41.694 --> 17:43.195
-Diner.
-Boring!

17:43.195 --> 17:45.197
JJ girl:
<i>Finish it.</i>

17:45.197 --> 17:47.466
JJs:
Yes! Yes!

17:47.466 --> 17:49.068
Whoo!

17:49.068 --> 17:50.536
This is so much fun.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.372
I wish I met you guys
many, many, many meets ago.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.241
Oh, yeah. Same here.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.609
Except I wouldn't
have been here.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.312
I had a little <i>Orange</i>
<i>is the New Black</i> situation.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.347
Oh, I'm sure
you didn't even do that.

18:01.347 --> 18:05.017
Let's yell that chant again
where we need body parts
and stomp on them!

18:05.017 --> 18:06.319
(phone dings)

18:06.319 --> 18:08.321
<i>-Diner.</i>
<i>-Boring!</i>

18:08.321 --> 18:10.022
<i>-Diner.</i>
<i>-Boring!</i>

18:10.022 --> 18:12.325
Whoa. Who are those
little lovebirds?

18:12.325 --> 18:14.560
Who cares?

18:14.560 --> 18:15.628
Whoo!

18:15.628 --> 18:17.396
Brock, kick him in the nuts!

18:17.396 --> 18:19.565
Oh no, honey.
She's just gonna sing
the national anthem.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.135
(feedback whines)

18:25.037 --> 18:27.707
Audrey:
And I'll text you,
and I'll text you,

18:27.707 --> 18:31.177
and I'm gonna text you,
and... you!

18:31.177 --> 18:33.579
I will never forget you.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.082
BFFFFs for life.
Am I right, girl?

18:36.082 --> 18:38.284
So right.
You're so right.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.552
Hey, babe.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.487
Babe, you did it!

18:41.487 --> 18:43.623
The champion of all
of this stuff you did!

18:43.623 --> 18:45.524
I am so proud of you.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.226
Oh, babe.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.295
Did you have more
or less than three beers?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.163
-Yes.
-You'll want to
be careful with her.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.499
She ate her entire
body weight in nachos.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.068
Hey, I'm gonna take this
and take off.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.103
Hey, Damien!

18:57.103 --> 18:59.071
All right. I gotcha.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.106
(squeals)

19:00.106 --> 19:02.541
Gonna get you home
and go to sleepy.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.143
(groans)

19:04.143 --> 19:06.278
-(knock on door)
-I am smiling!

19:06.278 --> 19:08.280
-(knocking continues)
-Oh.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.551
Hey, dude.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.553
Somebody had
a crazy night last night.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.656
Started following Lauren
on Snapchat.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.525
Actually, you know...
I'm not sure how much longer

19:19.525 --> 19:21.027
I can keep
hanging out with Lauren.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.294
I mean,
she's nice and everything,

19:22.294 --> 19:24.263
but she just
documents fun things.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.165
I mean, we never
actually experience them.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.267
Hey, you gotta save
those pictures
for a rainy day, bro.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.970
I feel like there's
somebody out there

19:30.970 --> 19:32.304
who's better
for me, you know?

19:32.304 --> 19:34.373
-I can't settle.
-Mm.

19:34.373 --> 19:35.508
Whoa.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.276
I think my sister had a point.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.279
(scoffs)
What am I talking about?

19:40.279 --> 19:42.114
She's crazy.
She thinks she's on a TV show.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.215
-Stupid girl.
-(laughs)

19:43.215 --> 19:45.284
I am on a TV show.

19:45.284 --> 19:46.285
-What?
-Yeah.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.287
I was cast
on <i>Sex Crimes Unit: Annapolis.</i>

19:48.287 --> 19:49.488
No frickin' way.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.656
Yes frickin' way.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.025
I'm Master Chief Petty Officer
Dominique Dufresne,

19:53.025 --> 19:54.360
a smoking hot
computer genius

19:54.360 --> 19:56.996
for the whole entire
Navy on the planet.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.532
Well, that explains
the outfit... I think.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.067
Yeah.
They let me wear it home.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.735
I'm going to go to a bar
and have people buy me drinks

20:02.735 --> 20:04.336
and thank me for my service.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.304
I salute you.

20:05.304 --> 20:07.373
Oh, thank you!

20:07.373 --> 20:09.075
You boys don't wait up, okay?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.211
-(door opens)
-Wanna go to the bar?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.646
-(door closes)
-Brian, that's my sister.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.554
(phone vibrates)

20:24.256 --> 20:26.325
-Hello?
<i>-Hey. It's Audrey.</i>

20:26.325 --> 20:30.262
I know we were going to come in
today to finish up Dreyerson,
but it's Sunday.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.164
We can wait
until tomorrow, right?

20:32.164 --> 20:35.301
Okay. Sure.
Are you sure?

20:35.301 --> 20:38.337
Yeah, I had way too much
fun last night,

20:38.337 --> 20:39.472
and I'm paying for it.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.241
<i>So have a good day</i>
<i>with Lauren.</i>

20:42.241 --> 20:43.542
<i>Tell her I said hi.</i>

20:43.542 --> 20:46.378
Actually, I kind of...
I called things off with Lauren.

20:46.378 --> 20:47.646
Oh. Really?

20:47.646 --> 20:50.282
It looked like you were having
so much fun together.

20:50.282 --> 20:51.584
<i>Yeah, but ultimately,</i>

20:51.584 --> 20:54.253
<i>there was just no special spark</i>
<i>between us, you know?</i>

20:54.253 --> 20:56.622
You have to have that, right?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.192
Yeah. You have to have that.

21:02.128 --> 21:05.364
<i>♪ And my heart</i>
