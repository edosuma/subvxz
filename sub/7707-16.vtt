WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:06.438
Okay, how about
Cameron if it's a boy

00:06.440 --> 00:09.808
and Amanda
if it's a girl?

00:09.810 --> 00:12.511
You know, I was thinking
if it was a girl

00:12.513 --> 00:14.813
maybe we could
name it after my mother.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.282
You want to name her
the Witch of Endor?

00:17.918 --> 00:19.151
[sighs]

00:19.153 --> 00:20.986
What about naming her Whitney?

00:20.988 --> 00:23.222
Or maybe Sheila E.?

00:23.224 --> 00:25.257
I've got the perfect name

00:25.259 --> 00:27.559
Rin Tin Tanner.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.031
You want to name
my child after a dog?

00:33.034 --> 00:35.067
A<i> noble</i> dog.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.535
A brave dog.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.605
A dog who saved lives.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.974
And if it's a girl,
we'll call her Spuds.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.545
[theme music]

01:16.610 --> 01:18.811
[music continues]

01:45.172 --> 01:47.606
[music continues]

01:57.418 --> 01:58.951
Hi.. ALF!

01:58.953 --> 02:01.320
What have I told you
about being inside the house

02:01.322 --> 02:02.855
when there are people here.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.657
More than I really
care to know.

02:05.659 --> 02:06.959
Well, go on
out to the garage

02:06.961 --> 02:08.527
and don't come back
until the workmen

02:08.529 --> 02:10.095
'have left for the day.'

02:10.097 --> 02:12.030
They've been here for weeks.

02:12.032 --> 02:15.767
How long does it take to build
a stupid baby nursery anyway?

02:17.171 --> 02:19.938
Twice as long as they
tell you it's gonna take.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.875
Why don't you come out with me?

02:22.877 --> 02:25.811
We can play pin the tailpipe
back on the car.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.581
It's not as bad as it sounds.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.518
I'm sorry,
I can't right now, ALF.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.819
Kate and I are gonna have

02:33.821 --> 02:35.988
our first Lamaze class
this afternoon.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.158
What's a Lamaze class?

02:39.160 --> 02:42.794
It's where expectant parents
rehearse for the baby's birth.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.631
Today we're gonna
practice breathing.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.466
Well, I could teach you that.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.201
One, inhale.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.536
[inhales deeply]

02:50.538 --> 02:52.271
Two, exhale.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.739
[exhales sharply]

02:53.741 --> 02:55.407
There, you graduated.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.910
Now you don't have to go.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.611
Sorry, ALF,
Kate and I are breathing

02:59.613 --> 03:02.047
together this afternoon.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.582
Admit it, wilderness

03:03.584 --> 03:06.451
this baby's become
an obsession with you.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.220
Well, of course
it's an obsession.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.155
It's the miracle of life.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.257
It's-it's the marvel of creation

03:12.259 --> 03:14.326
the mystery of being.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.994
Congratulations.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.597
You're giving birth
to an episode of "Nova."

03:20.634 --> 03:22.668
[instrumental music]

03:25.306 --> 03:28.340
And then, the doctor put the
ultrasound machine on my stomach

03:28.342 --> 03:29.775
and we could see
the baby's head

03:29.777 --> 03:31.577
and we could see
the baby's legs.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.579
We even saw
its heart beating.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.846
Please, Kate!

03:34.848 --> 03:36.915
Some of us are eating here.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.985
Since when have
you been squeamish?

03:39.987 --> 03:43.255
Since Kate started
talking about that parasite

03:43.257 --> 03:45.991
that's growing
and changing inside of her.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.495
Speaking of parasites,
ALF, are you ready

03:50.497 --> 03:53.165
for your fifth
helping of meat loaf?

03:53.167 --> 03:54.933
Don't mind if I do.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.536
When the baby gets here

03:57.538 --> 03:59.538
are we gonna be able
to tell it about ALF?

03:59.540 --> 04:01.306
We'll have to eventually.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.575
You know, the funny thing
about this baby is that

04:03.577 --> 04:05.377
it's going to be
growing up with ALF.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.679
I mean, you know,
to the baby

04:07.681 --> 04:09.581
he won't be weird or anything.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.017
He'll just be...normal.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.186
Don't mind me.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.888
I love being discussed
in the third person.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.491
Sorry, ALF.

04:19.493 --> 04:22.227
Just don't let it happen again.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.795
[doorbell rings]

04:23.797 --> 04:26.031
I'll get it. Hide him.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.774
Oh, hi, Raquel. Hey, Laverne.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.442
Uh, we're sorry
to disturb your dinner.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.710
Oh, we're used to..

04:38.712 --> 04:40.879
I mean, come on in.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.781
Oh, and how's
the little mommy-to-be?

04:42.783 --> 04:45.117
[chuckles]
Not so little.

04:45.119 --> 04:48.186
She blocks the whole TV
when she walks in front of it.

04:49.223 --> 04:50.489
Well, you know the old adage

04:50.491 --> 04:52.291
"Pregnancy is nature's
little way of saying

04:52.293 --> 04:54.359
wear a tent."

04:54.361 --> 04:55.694
I've heard that.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.795
We'll only take a moment.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.097
It's about the Litwak's house.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.701
Isn't it, Laverne?

05:02.703 --> 05:05.037
What? Oh, right.
Yes, our house. Yes.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.741
Wh-what about
your house, Laverne?

05:09.743 --> 05:12.644
Well, we might want to sell it,
someday, you know.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.179
So, I was wondering, well, Kate

05:14.181 --> 05:17.282
since you're in the actual
field of real estate

05:17.284 --> 05:19.518
what, um, you thought..

05:19.520 --> 05:20.986
...about that.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.655
About what?

05:23.657 --> 05:26.124
- Laverne.
- Hmm.

05:26.126 --> 05:29.394
Kate could probably
get a much better idea

05:29.396 --> 05:31.930
of what your house is worth
if you take her outside

05:31.932 --> 05:36.034
and go over there
for at least five minutes.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.237
That would help a lot.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.773
Now?

05:43.477 --> 05:44.910
If you wouldn't mind.

05:44.912 --> 05:48.447
You know, just in case
we decide to sell it someday.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.615
Well, al-alright, Laverne.

05:50.617 --> 05:53.418
If it's..
If it's that important.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.519
Take your time now.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.887
Ladies, you know
the old adage

05:55.889 --> 05:58.290
"Appraise in haste,
repent at leisure."

06:02.162 --> 06:03.895
That one I hadn't heard.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.898
I thought they'd never leave.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.667
Well, whatever's up, Raquel?

06:08.669 --> 06:10.969
[chuckles]
Laverne and I want to throw

06:10.971 --> 06:12.871
a surprise baby shower for Kate.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.972
- That's very..
- Here.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.440
- ...nice..
- Saturday.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.742
...of you.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.612
We've asked, uh,
Kate's college friends

06:20.614 --> 06:22.314
and all the women
in the neighborhood

06:22.316 --> 06:23.882
except for Hazel Hurlbut.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.050
She and I have not spoken

06:25.052 --> 06:27.352
since that ugly
leaf-raking incident.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.223
A baby shower sounds like fun.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.257
I could help.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.592
That was the plan.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.893
Now, we will bring everything

06:34.895 --> 06:36.762
but the refreshments,
the decorations

06:36.764 --> 06:38.830
the party favors,
and the folding chairs.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.265
Sounds fair.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.135
Well, it's the least
Auntie Raquel can do.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.370
Well, I'll you
get back to your dinner.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.339
Meat loaf again, huh?

06:47.341 --> 06:48.940
We liked it.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.409
Well, to each his own.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.710
Toodles.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.547
What's a surprise baby shower?

06:55.549 --> 06:57.649
It's a big pain in the..

06:57.651 --> 06:59.951
So, when's my shower?

07:00.788 --> 07:02.421
How did you know?

07:02.423 --> 07:04.656
Laverne cracked.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.491
Well, at least
pretend to be surprised

07:06.493 --> 07:09.294
so you don't hurt
Auntie Raquel's feelings.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.997
If it's more convenient

07:11.999 --> 07:13.532
I could stay out here.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.768
And you could just pitch the
rest of my dinner into my mouth.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.372
Just come back
to the table, ALF.

07:20.374 --> 07:21.606
No thanks.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.342
I've heard enough
about the stepford baby.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.215
[instrumental music]

07:39.993 --> 07:42.494
- Laverne.
- Hmm.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.663
You're supposed
to<i> twist</i> streamers

07:44.665 --> 07:45.831
when you hang them.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.366
Oh, is that written somewhere?

07:48.368 --> 07:51.369
Well, it doesn't
have to be written somewhere.

07:51.371 --> 07:52.737
If everybody knows something

07:52.739 --> 07:54.840
there's no need to write it.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.741
Hazel Hurlbut was right.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.810
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.146
[doorbell rings]

08:01.148 --> 08:02.347
Excuse me.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.351
- Lynn, hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.886
What a thoughtful present.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.721
We can practice
on this one.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.256
I hope you don't mind.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.593
The sitter came down with a
serious case of concert tickets.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.127
(Lynn)
'Are you kidding?'

08:16.129 --> 08:18.363
Listen, mom will
be here any minute.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.699
He is so cute.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.735
Oh, Andrea,
you brought the baby.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.837
I suppose that's nice.

08:30.143 --> 08:34.145
So, this is where they're
gonna stash the bad seed.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.349
I may throw up.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.086
Which could only help
this wallpaper.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.935
Oh, great. The incredible
expanding woman is home.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.672
Oh, what,
what a wonderful surprise.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.174
Oh, thank you, Raquel, Laverne.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.210
How did you know
it was our idea?

09:07.381 --> 09:08.880
Who else..

09:08.882 --> 09:11.049
...could be so thoughtful?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.953
Oh, Andrea,
you brought little Elliot.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.756
Yeah. I'm afraid
it's past his nap time, though.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.825
If, if there's somewhere
I could just go lay him down.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.794
We can christen the nursery.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.162
Come on,
I'll show you where it is.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.196
Great.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.965
Oh, hi.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.433
Kate, were you really surprised?

09:28.435 --> 09:32.137
Oh, yes. I was shocked.
Really. I had no idea.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.173
You told her, didn't you?

[instrumental lullaby music]

09:39.179 --> 09:40.512

'It's right in here, Andrea.'

09:52.993 --> 09:55.860
- Oh, what a cute room.
- Thanks.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.096
Come on, sweetie.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.333
There we go.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.537
Does he need anything?

10:05.539 --> 10:08.239
Um, $35,000 for college.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.507

are you?

'Yeah.'

10:34.234 --> 10:37.168
We're getting one of you
bundles of joy pretty soon.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.704
Yeah. Yeah.

10:39.706 --> 10:43.008
People will be making
a big fuss over it.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.010
Lynn will be saying things like

10:45.012 --> 10:47.579
"Uchie cuchie, little mimi."

11:08.602 --> 11:12.203
Oh, I'll be sneezing

11:23.750 --> 11:26.484
[sneezing continues]

11:27.187 --> 11:29.187
I'll check on that.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.523
It was probably the cat.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.957
Or the plumbing.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.526
Or the cat in the plumbing.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.382
Watch.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.287
[sneezing]

12:02.289 --> 12:04.923
See, allergic to babies.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.324
[knock on door]

12:06.326 --> 12:08.493
[whispering]
What is going on in here?

12:08.495 --> 12:11.863
ALF, we have a house
full of guests.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.933
I'm afraid I've got
some bad news, motherlode.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.802
You won't be able
to keep your baby.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.070
What?

12:19.072 --> 12:21.639
I found out
I'm allergic to them.

12:21.641 --> 12:24.476
But don't worry,
I'll make it up to you.

12:24.478 --> 12:25.543
[sneezes]

12:26.580 --> 12:28.813
I'll get you a goldfish.

12:28.815 --> 12:32.183
You are not giving away
our baby.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.519
Who said anything
about giving it away?

12:34.521 --> 12:37.522
I'm sure we can get
a good price for it.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.492
I'm sure we can get
a better price for<i> you.</i>

12:42.062 --> 12:43.528
[sneezes]

12:43.530 --> 12:45.864
ALF, it's-it's probably
just the baby powder

12:45.866 --> 12:48.032
that's making you sneeze.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.001
No. No, it's not.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.669
On Melmac we used baby powder

12:51.671 --> 12:54.439
instead of non-dairy creamer
on our tacos.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.641
[sneezes]

12:58.145 --> 13:00.211
We will talk about this later.

13:00.213 --> 13:03.615
Now, please, get back out
to the garage.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.617
[sniffling]

13:05.619 --> 13:07.152
Oh.

13:07.154 --> 13:10.321
Oh, this is all your fau..

13:10.323 --> 13:11.856
...fau..

13:11.858 --> 13:12.957
..fau..

13:12.959 --> 13:15.093
[sneezes]

13:17.764 --> 13:20.465
Hey, they really are
more absorbent.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.368
[instrumental music]

13:25.105 --> 13:26.838
(Jake)
'No thanks, Uncle Trevor.'

13:26.840 --> 13:28.540
I'm not really hungry.

13:28.542 --> 13:31.342
I didn't know it was possible
to stuff pork rinds.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.115
Thanks.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.252
ALF! ALF, what
are you doing in here?

13:41.254 --> 13:44.155
I've run away from garage.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.124
What are you talking about?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.392
Well, I can't run
away from home

13:47.394 --> 13:50.028
because I don't have
a home anymore.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.196
[whispering]
What happened?

13:51.198 --> 13:53.331
I'm allergic to babies.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.933
Kate's having one

13:54.935 --> 13:56.801
she won't let me sell it.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.103
Ergo, I go.

13:59.105 --> 14:03.208
I never heard of anybody being
allergic to babies before.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.377
Oh, excuse me,
knower of all things!

14:06.379 --> 14:07.879
If you haven't heard of it

14:07.881 --> 14:09.747
it must be my imagination.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.617
How did you get in here?

14:12.619 --> 14:14.686
Agility, cunning..

14:14.688 --> 14:17.555
...and waiting for Trevor
to go into the john.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.491
You can't stay here.
It's too risky.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.227
Come on, I'll take you
back to the Tanners.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.362
[grunting]

14:25.332 --> 14:27.765
You're heavier
than you look.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.467
I have big bones.

14:30.737 --> 14:33.538
So, which side
of the bed do you want?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.773
ALF, you can't live
in my room.

14:35.775 --> 14:38.877
What if Aunt Raquel
and Uncle Trevor see ya?

14:38.879 --> 14:40.144
Good point.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.947
Let's get a place
at the beach.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.682
ALF, we can't be roommates.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.019
It just wouldn't work out.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.054
We'll get along fine.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.223
I'll be the sloppy one.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.160
[instrumental music]

14:56.162 --> 14:58.129
- Oh, it's so cute.
- I know.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.230
So when are you going
to break down

14:59.232 --> 15:00.531
and have one of your own?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.634
Oh, please.
I can't even grow plants.

15:02.636 --> 15:03.501
[laughs]

15:03.503 --> 15:04.702
I'm sorry to be a wet blanket

15:04.704 --> 15:06.037
but I really do
have a plane to catch.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.238
Oh, honey, thank you so much

15:07.240 --> 15:08.573
for coming all this way.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.807
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.509
- Oh.
- I should get going too.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.511
I left my daughter at mall
three hours ago.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.679
If I don't pick her up soon,
I think

15:14.681 --> 15:16.481
I'm gonna have to get
a second job.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.749
Say goodbye to Willie for me.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.517
Oh, I will.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.319
A seven-year-old knows
that you're supposed to

15:21.321 --> 15:22.954
twist streamers
when you hang them.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.290
Well then, next time
you wanna throw a baby shower

15:25.292 --> 15:27.025
get a seven-year-old
to help you.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.093
Don't think I won't.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.329
You still owe me
for that plastic stork.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.967
Dad, why do they
call these cold cuts?

15:37.137 --> 15:38.836
Oh, I don't know.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.773
Because they're cold and..

15:41.775 --> 15:43.141
...they're cut, I guess.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.177
Cold cuts.
Uh, I don't know.

15:46.179 --> 15:49.314
Well, what would you call them
if you heated them up?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.787
I don't know.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.821
I don't know nothing.

15:56.823 --> 15:57.922
[knock on door]

15:57.924 --> 15:58.957
(Jake)
'Yo.'

15:58.959 --> 16:00.391
Yeah. Come on in.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.529
Uh, hi, Mr. Tanner.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.364
- Hi, squirt.
- Hi, Jake.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.666
Hello, Jake. What's up?

16:08.668 --> 16:09.934
Well..

16:09.936 --> 16:11.502
Uh..

16:12.672 --> 16:13.838
Something wrong?

16:13.840 --> 16:15.840
Not wrong exactly.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.775
More like missing.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.611
What, did you lose something?

16:20.613 --> 16:22.780
Look, I can't come
right out and tell ya.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.016
I said I wouldn't,
and I got honor.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.784
You name some stuff
that could be missing

16:26.786 --> 16:28.820
and I'll tell you
whether you're hot or cold.

16:28.822 --> 16:29.887
- ALF.
- Hot.

16:29.889 --> 16:30.922
I win.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.958
How do you know he's missing?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.727
I found him.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.328
- Where is he?
- My room.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.364
Top of the stairs,
second door on your right.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.784
Now, the room is starting
to work for me.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.889
ALF? ALF, what are you doing?

17:04.891 --> 17:07.425
All that I can
with these pieces.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.295
Come home with me
this<i> instant!</i>

17:11.297 --> 17:13.131
I am home, Willie.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.932
I live here now.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.902
Would you give me a hand
with that chiffonier?

17:17.904 --> 17:19.637
Stop redecorating.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.040
What if Trevor
and Raquel hear you?

17:22.042 --> 17:23.508
Relax, wilco.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.942
They're out in their garden

17:24.944 --> 17:27.912
seeing if any of their potatoes
look like celebrities.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.883
Why would you want
to live here?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.451
What do you care?

17:33.453 --> 17:36.220
You've got Kate
and Lynn and Brian.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.790
And pretty soon
you'll have that..

17:38.792 --> 17:41.726
...B word.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.294
"B word?"

17:43.296 --> 17:45.229
W-what do you mean,
the baby?

17:45.231 --> 17:46.497
[sneezes]

17:47.600 --> 17:51.169
See, that's why I can't
live with you anymore.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.905
I'm allergic to babies.

17:53.907 --> 17:57.742
[scoffs]
What do you, what do you mean
you're allergic to babies?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.610
Somebody brought one
to Kate's shower

17:59.612 --> 18:01.546
and put it in the nursery.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.247
Soon as I went near the kid

18:03.249 --> 18:05.950
I nearly sneezed up a lung.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.518
[sneezes]

18:07.520 --> 18:09.153
Well, you're sneezing now.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.988
There's no baby here.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.825
Well, all I have to do
is think about babies

18:13.827 --> 18:16.160
and I sneeze.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.595
Well, there you are, ALF.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.730
You're not allergic to babies.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.934
The whole thing
is psychosomatic.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.569
Psychosomatic?

18:24.571 --> 18:27.872
What's that, a food processor
at the Bates Motel?

18:29.976 --> 18:34.412
It means you may think that this
baby is gonna take your place.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.181
Don't try to analyze me

18:37.183 --> 18:39.717
I'm too complex.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.253
Well, I'm worried
about you, ALF.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.522
Yeah, well, don't bother.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.125
I'm no longer
a concern of yours.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.694
I'm history. Vapor.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.730
Yesterday's old,
stinky, smelly garbage

18:52.732 --> 18:54.966
with maggots all over it.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.603
You know, when I married Kate

18:58.605 --> 19:01.539
I loved her more than
anything in the world.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.508
And then we had
Lynn and Brian

19:03.510 --> 19:06.210
and I found out
I love them just as much

19:06.212 --> 19:09.413
but that didn't mean
that I loved Kate any the less.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.748
And then..

19:13.553 --> 19:15.386
Well, maybe, uh..

19:15.388 --> 19:18.389
...it's not exactly
the same, but..

19:18.391 --> 19:20.858
...you know, we love you, pal.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.760
We all do.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.196
On whose behalf
are you speaking?

19:25.198 --> 19:27.265
Well, my own,
of course, and..

19:27.267 --> 19:29.834
...Lynn's and Brian's.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.036
Yeah? And?

19:32.038 --> 19:36.874
And I'm sure Kate,
in her own special way..

19:36.876 --> 19:40.478
In her own particular way..

19:41.514 --> 19:43.881
Her own unique way..
She loves you.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.918
You mean that?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.688
No one, believe me..

19:50.690 --> 19:53.624
...no one could ever
take your place.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.660
But..

19:55.662 --> 19:57.695
...if you really think

19:57.697 --> 20:02.266
that you'd like
to live over here..

20:02.268 --> 20:06.103
Well, well, this room
and I really aren't in sync

20:06.105 --> 20:08.472
and there's no sink
in this room.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.175
But..

20:11.177 --> 20:12.510
But what?

20:13.513 --> 20:15.846
But if I'm to stay
at your house

20:15.848 --> 20:18.449
I wanna be important
to you guys.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.851
I wanna be a part of things.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.186
I want..

20:22.188 --> 20:23.821
...to name your baby.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.158
[chuckles]

20:27.160 --> 20:29.060
Forget it.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.128
(Raquel)
'Jake, are you in there?'

20:31.130 --> 20:32.430
[whispering]
ALF, hide.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.232
No kidding, Willie.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.940
Hello, Willie.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.645
Oh, hello, Raquel.

20:50.183 --> 20:51.916
What are you doing here?

20:53.953 --> 20:56.721
Oh, I was looking for our cat.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.992
How did he get in here?

21:03.129 --> 21:05.229
He came in through
the bathroom window.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.867
Well, when you're through
in here, would you please

21:09.869 --> 21:12.270
put the furniture back
the way you found it?

21:16.075 --> 21:17.875
Have a nice day.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.847
Let's go home
and burp the baby.

21:22.849 --> 21:26.550
No, the baby's
not even born yet.

21:26.552 --> 21:28.986
Then let's just
go home and burp.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.355
[laughs]

21:31.357 --> 21:32.890
[instrumental music]

21:35.228 --> 21:36.260
[instrumental music]

21:37.664 --> 21:39.030
"'We will have
a new baby soon

21:39.032 --> 21:42.566
"who will need that little bed,'
said papa bear.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.672
"'A new baby?'
Asked small bear.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.006
"He hadn't noticed
that mama bear

21:49.008 --> 21:51.309
"had grown very round lately.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.576
"Although he had noticed

21:52.578 --> 21:55.613
it was harder and harder
to sit on her lap."

21:55.615 --> 21:57.882
Can I sit on your lap?

21:57.884 --> 22:00.384
I'd rather you didn't.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.619
Fine.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.955
- Mom, dad's looking for you.
- Oh.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.792
He can't find
his dental floss.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.860
Tell him to look
in the toilet tank.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.030
Don't ask.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.169
ALF..

22:18.171 --> 22:21.105
...isn't this book
a little young for you?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.673
I know that.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.342
You know that.

22:24.344 --> 22:27.011
Apparently no one's told Kate.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.212
Want me to?

22:28.214 --> 22:31.515
