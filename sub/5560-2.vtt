She can't remember who she is,

00:08.926 --> 00:10.527
where she came from...
nothing...

00:10.529 --> 00:13.563
before she crawled out of
that bag in Times Square.

00:13.565 --> 00:14.664
(Mayfair)
Do you recognize her?

00:14.666 --> 00:16.099
- No.
- Then why is your name

00:16.101 --> 00:18.334
tattooed on her back?

00:18.336 --> 00:20.670
(Patterson) All of her tattoos
are brand-new.

00:20.672 --> 00:21.671
(Weller)
It's a treasure map.

00:21.673 --> 00:22.705
Come again?

00:22.707 --> 00:24.841
It's an address
and today's date.

00:24.843 --> 00:26.576
(Weller) Chao's gonna blow up
the Statue of Liberty.

00:26.578 --> 00:27.977
(Mayfair)
It's a Navy SEAL tattoo.

00:27.979 --> 00:30.713
If she was Navy,
she'd be in our database.

00:30.715 --> 00:32.048
Not if she was
special ops.

00:34.152 --> 00:35.919
Jane! Stop!

00:35.921 --> 00:37.720
(Borden)
It's possible that something

00:37.722 --> 00:39.189
familiar could trigger
her memory.

00:44.062 --> 00:46.329
(Jane)
None of this feels real.

00:46.331 --> 00:49.232
Who is this woman?

00:49.234 --> 00:50.767
(Weller) She might be just
the most important

00:50.769 --> 00:52.469
resource we've ever had.

00:59.744 --> 01:03.279
(Jane) Everything just feels
so out of control.

01:03.281 --> 01:04.947
(gunfire)

01:04.950 --> 01:09.252
I don't remember who I am,
who I was.

01:09.254 --> 01:12.322
Whatever life
I had is gone...

01:14.359 --> 01:17.494
shattered into a million
tiny pieces.

01:18.763 --> 01:21.130
Sometimes it's hard
to breathe.

01:21.165 --> 01:23.533
_

01:23.568 --> 01:26.402
I have something
I'd like to try.

01:26.404 --> 01:28.238
It's called a
Rorschach test,

01:28.240 --> 01:30.440
and it's designed to analyze
personality characteristics

01:30.442 --> 01:31.875
and emotional
functioning.

01:31.877 --> 01:33.576
But with your amnesia,

01:33.578 --> 01:35.278
my hope is that the
ethereal nature

01:35.280 --> 01:36.980
of the images might
provoke another memory.

01:36.982 --> 01:40.316
So, tell me what you see
when you look at these.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.320
Okay.

01:44.322 --> 01:47.590
A spider web.
Is that right?

01:47.592 --> 01:49.792
There's no right
or wrong.

01:49.794 --> 01:51.761
Let's try
another one, shall we?

01:57.802 --> 02:00.336
(gunshots)

02:03.241 --> 02:04.807
You missed two.

02:04.809 --> 02:07.477
Do it again.

02:07.479 --> 02:09.946
A target.

02:09.948 --> 02:12.615
Have they told you they think
I might be a Navy SEAL?

02:12.617 --> 02:14.517
They have, yes.

02:15.954 --> 02:18.421
I only have one memory of
training in the woods,

02:18.423 --> 02:21.324
but didn't seem
very official.

02:21.326 --> 02:25.261
SEAL training is
very... unconventional.

02:25.263 --> 02:27.430
So, that actually
makes sense.

02:27.432 --> 02:29.532
Let's try
another one, shall we?

02:34.139 --> 02:35.872
Morning, sis.

02:35.874 --> 02:37.507
Oh, damn it,
did we wake you?

02:37.509 --> 02:39.475
I got an apartment broker
scheduled for tomorrow.

02:39.477 --> 02:41.110
We'll be out of your hair
in no time, I promise.

02:41.112 --> 02:43.179
There's no rush, Sarah.

02:43.181 --> 02:45.181
Huh, what is that
supposed to be?

02:45.183 --> 02:46.883
It's a pancake, all right?

02:46.885 --> 02:48.851
Mm-hmm.

02:48.853 --> 02:51.154
Morning, little buddy.

02:51.156 --> 02:52.322
"Morning,
Uncle Kurt."

02:52.324 --> 02:53.656
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:53.658 --> 02:57.060
So, Dad called
last night.

02:57.062 --> 02:58.661
Just wanted to know if
you were gonna go back

02:58.663 --> 03:01.864
for Taylor's memorial
this year.

03:01.866 --> 03:04.701
No, I've got too much
going on at work.

03:04.703 --> 03:07.537
He shouldn't be going
to that memorial either.

03:07.539 --> 03:09.005
Makes people uncomfortable.

03:09.007 --> 03:10.907
Yeah, well,
that's their problem.

03:12.544 --> 03:13.843
Yeah.

03:13.845 --> 03:16.179
Look, just think
about it, okay?

03:16.181 --> 03:18.014
Yeah.

03:18.016 --> 03:20.416
- Bye, buddy.
- Bye.

03:26.358 --> 03:28.157
What are we
doing in here?

03:28.159 --> 03:30.827
Your first memory was
triggered by being active.

03:30.829 --> 03:32.829
Maybe your muscles might
remember something

03:32.831 --> 03:34.397
your mind can't.

03:38.837 --> 03:40.503
That's an M-4.

03:40.505 --> 03:42.939
So, if you wanna fire that,
you're going to...

03:42.941 --> 03:44.774
...need to do...

03:44.776 --> 03:47.844
Exactly that.

03:47.846 --> 03:50.213
Step up.

03:52.917 --> 03:55.284
Okay, let's try this.

04:01.926 --> 04:04.060
(Patterson) Her body is covered
in cryptic symbols,

04:04.062 --> 04:05.862
map pieces, riddles.

04:05.864 --> 04:08.197
Whoever did this to her has
a very specific goal in mind.

04:08.199 --> 04:10.033
And what that goal is
remains a mystery.

04:10.035 --> 04:11.601
I have my best
people on it,

04:11.603 --> 04:14.370
but this information is
so varied and so dense,

04:14.372 --> 04:16.039
it could take
years to decode.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.408
I noticed a scar on
the back of her neck.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.745
Yeah, that.

04:22.747 --> 04:24.547
Got any idea
how old that is?

04:24.549 --> 04:25.782
Well, it's hard to
tell with these things,

04:25.784 --> 04:27.550
but it's definitely
not recent.

04:27.552 --> 04:29.285
- I don't wanna hurt you.
- You won't.

04:29.287 --> 04:31.387
Come on, hands up.

04:31.389 --> 04:32.755
Here we go.

04:32.757 --> 04:34.290
Start swinging.

04:34.292 --> 04:35.958
Come on,
come on.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.760
(grunting)

04:37.762 --> 04:39.829
All right?

04:39.831 --> 04:41.597
Again.

04:41.599 --> 04:43.833
We've captured hundreds of
numeric sequences and phrases

04:43.835 --> 04:46.102
from Jane's body in over
two dozen languages,

04:46.104 --> 04:47.970
and we're feeding
them into a database

04:47.972 --> 04:50.306
that I have designed that'll
cross-reference them

04:50.308 --> 04:53.009
with every information system
that we have access to.

04:53.011 --> 04:54.777
Like a Google alert
for her tattoos.

04:54.779 --> 04:58.314
Well... it's a little bit
more sophisticated than that.

04:58.316 --> 05:02.118
But, uh, yes, it's... it's
like a Google alert.

The hospital just called.
Chao is dead.

05:41.226 --> 05:42.658
(speaking Chinese)

05:46.131 --> 05:47.897
(Zapata) Chao had a massive
stroke at around midnight

05:47.899 --> 05:49.365
just as he was getting
out of surgery.

05:49.367 --> 05:52.168
I'm not buying it.
He was young, healthy.

05:52.170 --> 05:54.137
He also got shot.

05:54.139 --> 05:55.838
Get me the full autopsy.

walking away.

Canvas the hospital...
find me that doctor.

06:10.655 --> 06:12.522
(Patterson)
I did it!

06:12.524 --> 06:14.257
What, you found him?

I... what?
Who?

06:15.693 --> 06:18.361
Sorry, you were
in the middle of...

06:18.363 --> 06:19.962
Well, I unlocked
another tattoo.

06:21.366 --> 06:24.066
So, as we scanned some
of the numerical tattoos

06:24.068 --> 06:25.501
into the database,
one of them

06:25.503 --> 06:28.070
just jumped out at me.

06:28.072 --> 06:30.506
Right?
Do you see that?

06:30.508 --> 06:34.076
Okay, so, just pretend
that we're not you.

06:34.078 --> 06:36.412
Okay, the... the Chinese
symbols behind Jane's ear.

06:36.414 --> 06:39.348
The first clue that we
decoded was an address...

06:39.350 --> 06:43.085
399 White Street,
Apartment Seven.

06:43.087 --> 06:44.287
Okay?

06:44.289 --> 06:45.688
Okay, so, look at
this tattoo.

06:45.690 --> 06:48.090
Starts with 399,
has a bunch of letters

06:48.092 --> 06:50.560
just jumbled up in between,
and then it ends with seven.

06:50.562 --> 06:52.195
Do you see that?

06:52.197 --> 06:54.130
Who here knows what
a Vigenere cipher is?

06:54.132 --> 06:55.431
Put your hand down.

06:55.433 --> 06:57.433
It's a polyalphabetic
substitution code.

06:57.435 --> 06:59.268
(Patterson)
Yes, awesome.

06:59.270 --> 07:02.572
A Vigenere cipher is a method
of encrypting alphabetic text

07:02.574 --> 07:04.106
based on the letters
of a key word.

07:04.108 --> 07:05.741
And unless you
have the key word,

07:05.743 --> 07:07.376
it is next to impossible
to decode.

07:07.378 --> 07:08.778
- So, what's the key word?
- The words between

07:08.780 --> 07:11.147
the two numbers on
the original tattoo.

07:11.149 --> 07:12.648
Exactly.

07:12.650 --> 07:15.051
Use White Street Apartment
as your key word,

07:15.053 --> 07:16.586
and suddenly, the mess
of letters in between

07:16.588 --> 07:19.722
become "Major
Arthur Gibson".

07:19.724 --> 07:21.824
So, the first clue
unlocks the second.

07:21.826 --> 07:23.125
Crazy, right?

07:23.127 --> 07:24.594
Who is this Gibson guy?

07:24.596 --> 07:27.597
Okay, so, according to
his service records,

07:27.599 --> 07:31.567
Gibson flew F-22 missions
over Iraq and Afghanistan,

07:31.569 --> 07:34.170
earned a boatload of medals,
including the Silver Star,

07:34.172 --> 07:36.239
and then an injury
sidelined his flying career

07:36.241 --> 07:37.807
and he moved back
stateside.

07:37.809 --> 07:39.942
Took a desk job in Nevada
before coming to work

07:39.944 --> 07:41.844
for the Air Force
in New York.

07:41.846 --> 07:43.646
(Jane) Now that Chao's dead
and can't help me,

07:43.648 --> 07:45.815
Gibson might know who I am,
who did this to me.

07:45.817 --> 07:47.250
We gotta go talk to him.

07:47.252 --> 07:48.651
DMV records have him
living in Brooklyn.

07:48.653 --> 07:50.419
- Let's go.
- I'm coming with you.

07:50.421 --> 07:52.255
- Yes, you are.
- She is?

07:52.257 --> 07:55.157
You were dead against her going
into the field yesterday.

07:55.159 --> 07:56.692
I was wrong.

07:56.694 --> 07:58.694
We don't know how
the tattoos work yet.

07:58.696 --> 08:00.596
She should be there.

08:00.598 --> 08:02.164
It might help her
trigger her memory.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.966
And we all know she
can handle herself.

08:03.968 --> 08:05.902
Please, I can help
figure this out.

08:08.473 --> 08:10.239

08:33.231 --> 08:36.299
It's kind of a long story.
Mind if we come in?

08:36.301 --> 08:38.000
Hey, I don't know
what they told you,

08:38.001 --> 08:39.702

Silver Star for his charm.

probable cause.

10:17.035 --> 10:18.034
I'm afraid that's classified.

10:18.036 --> 10:19.935
So, a lot then?

10:19.937 --> 10:21.570
Gibson was never the same.

10:21.572 --> 10:23.539
His PTSD got
worse and worse

10:23.541 --> 10:25.174
until eventually, we had
to ground him.

10:25.176 --> 10:27.743
What exactly did he do
when he got back stateside?

10:27.745 --> 10:31.013
I'm sorry, but I can't
say much more.

10:31.015 --> 10:33.349
But unfortunately,
even the desk work

10:33.351 --> 10:35.251
got to be too much for him.

10:35.253 --> 10:37.086
We had no choice
but to discharge him.

10:37.088 --> 10:38.521
When was the last
time you spoke?

10:38.523 --> 10:40.189
A few months.

10:40.191 --> 10:43.893
After we let him go,
his marriage ended.

10:43.895 --> 10:48.964
He couldn't hold down a job,
he grew increasingly paranoid.

10:48.966 --> 10:51.133
I think he blamed me.

10:51.135 --> 10:53.035
So, why'd he blow up
his own house this morning?

10:53.037 --> 10:55.938
I can't begin to imagine.

10:55.940 --> 10:58.274
Look, ma'am,
I'm racing to contain

10:58.276 --> 10:59.942
a potentially volatile
situation,

10:59.944 --> 11:01.410
so I need to
know what you know.

11:01.412 --> 11:04.213
I've told you
everything I can.

11:04.215 --> 11:07.550
I wish we could have
done more for him.

11:07.552 --> 11:09.452
He was a good man.

11:17.595 --> 11:21.297
So, Gibson couldn't get over
killing all those civilians?

11:21.299 --> 11:24.600
That one day, that...
that single moment

11:24.602 --> 11:27.503
defined the rest of his life.

11:27.505 --> 11:30.639
Some things are
hard to forget.

11:30.641 --> 11:32.842
Borden says people are
shaped by their past.

11:32.844 --> 11:34.677
Do you think that's true?

11:38.149 --> 11:39.482
I wish it wasn't.

11:44.422 --> 11:48.624
What if I find out who I am
and I don't like it?

11:48.626 --> 11:50.926
- (phone ringing)
- It's Patterson.

11:50.928 --> 11:52.194
You're on speaker.

11:52.196 --> 11:53.496
I'm just going through
Gibson's files,

11:53.498 --> 11:54.997
and something's not right.

11:54.999 --> 11:56.599
Powers said they
sidelined Gibson

11:56.601 --> 11:58.334
because he was
suffering from PTSD.

11:58.336 --> 12:00.703
But according to his files,
they promoted him.

12:00.705 --> 12:02.204
They can still get
promoted off the desk.

12:02.206 --> 12:04.173
Maybe they're just trying to
take care of their own.

12:04.175 --> 12:07.543
Maybe, but they also raised
his security clearance,

12:07.545 --> 12:09.512
from Secret to
Top Secret and above.

12:09.514 --> 12:11.647
If Gibson was
suffering from PTSD

12:11.649 --> 12:13.282
they wouldn't have
increased his access.

12:13.284 --> 12:14.817
Nope, they would've
frozen him out.

12:14.819 --> 12:17.620
He was one of their top pilots
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

12:17.622 --> 12:20.156
So, what, they move
him back to Nevada?

12:20.158 --> 12:22.525
Bump him up in rank?
Raise his clearance?

12:22.527 --> 12:24.226
What are you thinking?

12:24.228 --> 12:25.461
Nellis, Nevada is where

12:25.463 --> 12:27.296
the Air Force
drone program is based.

12:27.298 --> 12:29.465
He didn't wash out.

12:29.467 --> 12:31.333
They made him
a drone pilot.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.835
(Patterson) <i>Okay, well,
that explains Nevada.</i>

12:32.837 --> 12:34.570
But when they moved
him to New York,

12:34.572 --> 12:36.205
his clearance skyrocketed.

12:36.207 --> 12:38.974
There's no
drone program here.

12:38.976 --> 12:41.010
Not one we know about.

12:44.215 --> 12:46.649
Oh, come on.
I'm gonna be late for work.

12:46.651 --> 12:47.816
(girl)
Daddy?

12:47.818 --> 12:50.753
Gibson.
What are you doing?

12:50.755 --> 12:53.088
I need you to do
something for me, Alex.

12:53.090 --> 12:55.191
Just put the
gun down, okay?

12:55.193 --> 12:57.860
I gave them everything.

12:57.862 --> 13:00.362
I did unspeakable
things for them.

13:00.364 --> 13:02.498
Gibson, my daughter
is innocent.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.401
I killed a lot of
innocent people, Alex.

13:05.403 --> 13:07.703
- Please, just let her go.
- No.

13:07.705 --> 13:11.106
This whole country
abandoned me.

13:11.108 --> 13:14.510
And today, you're gonna
help me teach them a lesson.

13:14.512 --> 13:15.878
All right, listen to me...

13:15.880 --> 13:18.514
No, you listen to me!

13:18.516 --> 13:20.783
You'll do as I say,

13:20.785 --> 13:24.520
or you'll never see
your daughter again.

13:24.522 --> 13:28.557
♪♪

13:29.834 --> 13:32.092
_

13:36.968 --> 13:38.000
(beep)

14:16.297 --> 14:17.863
Call the general for me,

14:17.865 --> 14:19.365
tell him I can't
make it Thursday.

14:21.969 --> 14:23.602
(phone ringing)

14:23.604 --> 14:26.205
Powers.

14:26.207 --> 14:27.740
Wait, what?

14:30.678 --> 14:32.345
No, that's not possible,
they're not...

14:35.817 --> 14:37.717
(car alarm sounding)

14:39.854 --> 14:42.521
We gotta drill into this guy's
life with everything we've got.

14:42.523 --> 14:44.457
I wanna know who Gibson
was talking to,

14:44.459 --> 14:45.783
what he's been
spending his money on.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.327
And Patterson, I want
you to find out about

14:47.362 --> 14:48.694
the explosives he used
on his own house.

14:48.696 --> 14:50.396
- Of course.
- And I wanna see inside

14:50.398 --> 14:51.564
that safe, okay?

14:51.566 --> 14:52.665
There's gotta be
something in there.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.700
- On it.
- Thank you.

14:54.702 --> 14:56.902
His house and Powers.

14:56.904 --> 14:59.004
This is just the beginning.

14:59.006 --> 15:00.573
All right, the guy's
not gonna stop.

15:00.575 --> 15:03.175
So, we need to find out
who his next target is.

15:03.177 --> 15:04.710
I can't help but think
we pushed Gibson

15:04.712 --> 15:06.212
over the edge this morning
when we knocked on his door.

15:06.214 --> 15:07.480
- (Zapata) What are you talking about?
- (Weller) Yeah.

15:07.482 --> 15:09.148
That wasn't our fault.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.916
I didn't say it was.

15:10.918 --> 15:12.551
Reed, enough.

15:12.553 --> 15:14.920
Blindly following her
tattoos is reckless.

15:14.922 --> 15:17.390
I don't think you recognize
just how important she is.

15:17.392 --> 15:20.092
It's a little early to make
that call, don't you think?

15:20.094 --> 15:22.261
No. The most important
thing is to find

15:22.263 --> 15:23.896
Gibson and to stop him.

15:23.898 --> 15:26.932
So, can you join Patterson
and find me a lead?

15:28.536 --> 15:29.735
Let's go.

15:30.705 --> 15:32.104
Thank you.

15:35.743 --> 15:37.410
- What if he's right?
- He's not.

15:37.412 --> 15:39.011
And what if these
tattoos are a trap?

15:39.013 --> 15:40.246
- Jane.
- We don't know anything

15:40.248 --> 15:42.515
about who did this
to me or why,

15:42.517 --> 15:45.050
and people are
losing their lives.

15:45.052 --> 15:47.920
Jane, this is not
your fault, okay?

15:47.922 --> 15:49.588
This is not your fault.

15:49.590 --> 15:52.158
Weller, come with me.

15:53.594 --> 15:55.394
Yes, ma'am.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.566
General, what the hell
is going on?

16:00.568 --> 16:02.968
This morning a former
Air Force pilot

16:02.970 --> 16:04.737
blew up his own house.

16:04.739 --> 16:06.405
Three hours later,
his former CO

16:06.407 --> 16:09.542
dies in an air to ground
missile attack.

16:09.544 --> 16:11.277
Please, do me the courtesy

16:11.279 --> 16:14.647
of admitting these
incidents are connected.

16:14.649 --> 16:17.483
They are connected.

16:17.485 --> 16:19.084
Care to elaborate?

16:19.086 --> 16:23.088
It was decided the country
needed a domestic UAV program

16:23.090 --> 16:24.890
that could not only
surveil targets,

16:24.892 --> 16:28.828
but also, in extreme
circumstances... take action.

16:28.830 --> 16:32.064
You're telling me
we have armed drones

16:32.066 --> 16:34.300
flying over American soil.

16:34.302 --> 16:36.569
It's in place
as a last resort.

16:36.571 --> 16:38.971
We've never dispensed
ordinance domestically.

16:38.973 --> 16:41.607
Until today.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.976
Gibson got control of
one of these UAVs, how?

16:43.978 --> 16:46.612
(general) He kidnapped the daughter of
one of our avionics specialists,

16:46.614 --> 16:48.180
forced him to
retrofit a drone

16:48.182 --> 16:50.249
with an alternate control card
that severed

16:50.251 --> 16:51.784
its signal with
our satellite,

16:51.786 --> 16:54.019
allowing Gibson
to take over remotely.

16:54.021 --> 16:55.321
And where is that girl now?

16:55.323 --> 16:56.989
We believe Gibson
still has her.

16:56.991 --> 16:59.625
And the drone... can you
recover control, locate it?

16:59.627 --> 17:00.993
He's frozen us out.

17:00.995 --> 17:03.429
And it was designed
to evade radar detection.

17:03.431 --> 17:04.997
It still has
another two missiles,

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
but I've got my entire
team working on it.

17:07.001 --> 17:09.602
We need to find him before
he kills anyone else.

17:09.604 --> 17:11.537
You should've come clean with this
as soon as we asked you about it...

17:11.539 --> 17:13.606
- We had no idea...
- No idea, what?

17:13.608 --> 17:14.940
That he'd blow up
his own house?

17:14.942 --> 17:16.608
There were larger
issues at...

17:16.611 --> 17:18.277
Larger than what?

17:18.279 --> 17:20.679
An armed rogue drone?
Ten dead people?

17:20.681 --> 17:22.815
Or a little girl who was
taken away from her father?

17:22.817 --> 17:24.617
- (Mayfair) Weller!
- We are trying...

17:24.618 --> 17:26.285
If anything happens to
that little girl...

17:26.287 --> 17:27.720
Walk away.

17:32.493 --> 17:35.227
Why is he doing this,
General?

17:35.229 --> 17:38.731
His motives could help us
anticipate his next target.

17:38.733 --> 17:42.368
(sighs)
I wish I knew.

17:42.370 --> 17:45.638
What I do know
is that Gibson

17:45.640 --> 17:47.673
is one of the most
efficient killing machines

17:47.675 --> 17:50.543
the Air Force has ever made.

17:54.215 --> 17:56.815
Doesn't something
feel off to you?

17:56.817 --> 17:59.351
Whoever did this to Jane
knew about the drone program.

17:59.353 --> 18:01.186
That information's
above Top Secret.

18:01.188 --> 18:03.022
Her first tattoo
helped us save lives.

18:03.024 --> 18:04.557
Hopefully this one will too.

18:04.559 --> 18:06.559
Maybe.

18:06.561 --> 18:09.695
Or maybe we're about to
knock over a hornets' nest.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.864
I don't think
Gibson recognized me.

18:11.866 --> 18:14.667
Chao didn't
recognize me either.

18:14.669 --> 18:16.435
So, so far, these tattoos
have sent us to people

18:16.437 --> 18:18.504
who don't seem to be
connected to me at all.

18:18.506 --> 18:20.239
If they've got nothing
to do with you,

18:20.241 --> 18:23.042
why are they on your body?

18:26.347 --> 18:27.613
Penance.

18:29.183 --> 18:31.250
(silenced gunshots)

18:35.189 --> 18:37.723
What?

18:37.725 --> 18:40.092
Hey, come take
a look at this.

18:51.906 --> 18:53.072
He's lying.

18:53.074 --> 18:54.640
I know.

18:54.642 --> 18:58.711
But threatening a three-star
general does not help us.

18:58.713 --> 19:00.279
Sorry.

19:02.216 --> 19:04.717
(sighs)

19:04.719 --> 19:06.719
How are you holding up?

19:06.721 --> 19:09.455
I know you don't do too
well with missing kids.

19:09.457 --> 19:10.723
I'm fine.

19:10.725 --> 19:14.693
Kurt, I need to know
where your head is.

19:17.431 --> 19:19.131
I've been thinking
about Taylor.

19:23.437 --> 19:25.904
Then maybe you should start
talking to someone...

19:25.906 --> 19:28.774
- No, I don't wanna talk.
- Listen to me.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.110
That girl's disappearance
was not your fault.

19:31.112 --> 19:32.478
You were ten years old.

19:39.453 --> 19:43.255
One of my last
memories of her...

19:43.257 --> 19:46.759
we were climbing a tree
in our backyard.

19:46.761 --> 19:49.595
And we were up
pretty high.

19:49.597 --> 19:52.331
She was fearless.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.400
I was above her.

19:56.170 --> 20:00.139
I stepped on
her hand accidentally.

20:00.141 --> 20:03.375
She slipped.

20:03.377 --> 20:06.011
She fell,
cut herself.

20:08.783 --> 20:12.751
It left a really big scar
on the back of her neck.

20:17.324 --> 20:20.959
Jane has the same scar.

20:20.961 --> 20:23.729
Same eyes.

20:23.731 --> 20:26.065
She's the right age.

20:28.469 --> 20:30.169
I know why it's me.

20:30.171 --> 20:32.504
I know why my name
is on her back.

20:34.809 --> 20:37.176
I think Jane Doe
is Taylor Shaw.

20:37.178 --> 20:41.213
♪♪

21:01.640 --> 21:04.449
You think Jane
is Taylor Shaw?

21:04.451 --> 21:06.518
I do.

21:06.520 --> 21:10.588
I don't know why
and I don't know who.

21:10.590 --> 21:12.123
But someone sent
her back to me.

21:12.125 --> 21:13.258
That's impossible.

21:13.260 --> 21:14.559
Why?

21:14.561 --> 21:16.027
Why is my name
on her back?

21:16.029 --> 21:18.333
Taylor Shaw has been
missing for 25 years.

21:18.368 --> 21:18.997
Yeah.

21:19.032 --> 21:20.265
And she's not
missing anymore.

21:20.267 --> 21:23.535
Hey, we got into
Gibson's safe.

21:23.537 --> 21:25.403
It's an air-gapped
computer.

21:25.405 --> 21:27.072
Sorry, what does
that mean?

21:27.074 --> 21:28.606
It's a computer that's never
been connected to the Internet.

21:28.608 --> 21:30.442
It makes it impossible
for a third party

21:30.444 --> 21:31.810
to access or monitor it.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.278
The thing is,
there's not much on it

21:33.280 --> 21:35.747
but a few Word documents...
super weird.

21:35.749 --> 21:37.549
But this one caught my eye.

21:37.551 --> 21:40.485
Dates, times, locations.
Five of 'em.

21:40.487 --> 21:43.254
They line up with five seemingly
unrelated explosive accidents.

21:43.256 --> 21:45.957
Faulty gas lines,
car crashes...

21:45.959 --> 21:47.459
(Zapata) Victims are all
foreign nationals.

21:47.461 --> 21:49.094
All from the Middle East,
all incidents occurring

21:49.096 --> 21:50.762
- on U.S. soil.
- Drone attacks.

21:50.764 --> 21:52.630
They've already hit
targets inside America.

21:52.632 --> 21:54.432
So, the general
lied to us.

21:54.434 --> 21:56.634
(Zapata) Each incident has a set
of initials next to it.

21:56.636 --> 21:58.303
"A.G.", Arthur Gibson,
for three of them,

21:58.305 --> 21:59.904
and "I.M." for the other two.

21:59.906 --> 22:01.840
We searched the Air Force's
employment records,

22:01.842 --> 22:05.243
and we think "I.M."
is another drone pilot...

22:05.245 --> 22:07.445
Major Ivan Musgrave.

22:07.447 --> 22:08.780
Got an address for him?

22:08.782 --> 22:10.148
Of course.

22:10.150 --> 22:13.118
Let's move.

22:15.322 --> 22:17.455
Jane, just wait here
for us, all right?

22:17.457 --> 22:21.326
Just until we get a read

22:21.328 --> 22:22.460
Thanks.

22:22.462 --> 22:23.695

22:23.697 --> 22:26.131
Major Musgrave,
this is the FBI.

22:26.133 --> 22:28.199

Hey!

22:38.712 --> 22:40.745

22:47.220 --> 22:49.154
Hey! Hey!
Did they go in there?

22:49.156 --> 22:51.723

23:07.841 --> 23:09.174

23:11.511 --> 23:14.212
Jane! Jane!
Let him go!

23:14.214 --> 23:16.548
Let him go.

23:16.550 --> 23:18.149
We want to question him,
not kill him.

23:18.151 --> 23:20.318
Turn over.
Turn over!

23:20.320 --> 23:23.087
(panting)

23:25.926 --> 23:27.425

23:27.427 --> 23:29.794

do anything wrong!

23:31.364 --> 23:33.097
You okay?

23:39.272 --> 23:41.272
All right, all right.
Okay, all right.

23:41.274 --> 23:42.774
- What?
- Fine, I got a couple of weapons

23:42.776 --> 23:44.042
up there that maybe
I shouldn't have,

23:44.044 --> 23:45.176
but show me an
airman who doesn't.

23:45.178 --> 23:46.611
That's not what
this is about.

23:46.613 --> 23:48.079
Your friend Gibson's
in serious trouble.

23:48.081 --> 23:49.180
So, we got some
questions for you.

23:49.182 --> 23:50.548
Gibson?
Man, that guy hates me.

23:50.550 --> 23:53.017
I'm the one who
turned him in.

23:53.019 --> 23:53.783
What?

23:53.818 --> 23:55.754
He was about to blow
the whistle on the whole...

23:55.755 --> 23:57.388
No, you people don't have
the clearance for this.

23:57.390 --> 23:59.257
- Keep talking.
- I wanna talk to Colonel Powers, now.

23:59.259 --> 24:01.025
Powers is dead.

24:01.027 --> 24:04.762
(Musgrave)
What? Since when?

24:04.764 --> 24:05.864
- Weller?
- (Zapata) Wait a minute.

24:05.866 --> 24:07.632
If Gibson hates this guy...

24:07.634 --> 24:09.968
We just brought him outside.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.369
(Zapata)
Go! Go! Go!

24:11.371 --> 24:13.204
- Get inside.
- No, wait, no.

24:13.206 --> 24:15.039
- Inside, get inside. Get inside!
- No, no, wait, that's him!

24:15.041 --> 24:16.741

he's standing right there...

25:58.195 --> 25:59.861
How did he get his
hands on this?

25:59.863 --> 26:01.663
He kidnapped the daughter
of an avionics specialist

26:01.665 --> 26:04.266
who helped him
hack the drone.

26:04.268 --> 26:05.867

<i>so she needs our help.</i>

26:08.205 --> 26:09.704
(Musgrave)
<i>This is terrible.</i>

26:09.706 --> 26:11.940
The program wasn't
last resort, was it?

26:11.942 --> 26:13.775
You'd already been
using it.

26:13.777 --> 26:16.912
Five confirmed kills.

26:16.914 --> 26:19.714
How much
collateral damage?

26:19.716 --> 26:21.349
Drones are messy.

26:21.351 --> 26:23.251
What, so Gibson
wanted to stop it?

26:23.253 --> 26:25.287
He was one of our best pilots,
but even he couldn't stomach

26:25.289 --> 26:27.222
the loss of
American civilians.

26:27.224 --> 26:29.124
(Weller) <i>What, he was gonna
blow the whistle?</i>

26:29.126 --> 26:33.295
Yeah...
yeah, he asked me to help.

26:33.297 --> 26:35.897
But, um, I turned him in.

26:35.899 --> 26:38.800
They stripped his clearance,
they pulled his pension.

26:38.802 --> 26:40.435
Threatened his family.

26:40.437 --> 26:42.838
We pushed him over the edge,
we destroyed his life.

26:45.108 --> 26:47.309
So, Gibson was
a good guy.

26:47.311 --> 26:50.545
He just wanted
the killing to stop.

26:50.547 --> 26:53.448
He killed ten innocent
people this morning.

26:53.450 --> 26:56.418
Good guys don't do that.

26:56.420 --> 27:00.622

ever do terrible things?

27:00.624 --> 27:04.059
I think terrible people

27:11.735 --> 27:14.069

<i>Gibson snapped.</i>

27:14.071 --> 27:15.704

a missile left.

27:21.612 --> 27:23.078

27:23.080 --> 27:25.080
I was hoping you were
gonna tell me that.

27:25.082 --> 27:26.915
I don't know, man,
the guy's vindictive.

27:26.917 --> 27:28.917
He's trying to hurt
the people that hurt him.

27:28.919 --> 27:32.254
Powers? Me?

27:32.256 --> 27:35.123
Who is next on the list?

27:37.461 --> 27:40.662
General, where do the
drone pilots operate from?

27:40.664 --> 27:43.465
That's classified.

27:43.467 --> 27:45.500
Gibson wants revenge,
that's obvious.

27:45.502 --> 27:47.202
But he also
hates the program

27:47.204 --> 27:48.970
and wants the public
to know about it.

27:48.972 --> 27:51.373
So, where would he hit if he
wants to do the most damage?

27:51.375 --> 27:52.874
General, please.

27:52.876 --> 27:54.709
- Here.
- Excuse me?

27:54.711 --> 27:56.311
The top three floors
of this building.

27:56.313 --> 27:58.046
The pilots
operate from here.

27:58.048 --> 28:00.115
But this doesn't
make any sense.

28:00.117 --> 28:01.850
If he wanted to
bomb our facility,

28:01.852 --> 28:03.051
he would've done it by now.

28:03.053 --> 28:05.687
Why wait?
Why...

28:07.357 --> 28:09.557
The shift change.

28:09.559 --> 28:11.993
Okay, what are
you talking about?

28:11.995 --> 28:13.561
The drones are in the air
for days at a time,

28:13.563 --> 28:15.463
but the pilots fly them
in 12-hour shifts

28:15.465 --> 28:16.998
so there's no overlap.
Twice a day,

28:17.000 --> 28:18.667
every pilot is
in this building.

28:18.669 --> 28:20.969
He's waiting for the overlap.
Maximum impact.

28:20.971 --> 28:23.071
A well-placed strike could
bring this whole building down.

28:23.073 --> 28:24.339
When's the next
shift change?

28:24.341 --> 28:26.308
An hour.

28:26.310 --> 28:27.809
So, we're evacuating now.

28:27.811 --> 28:29.511
If he sees the building
start to empty out,

28:29.513 --> 28:31.680
he'll hit us immediately,
cut his losses.

28:31.682 --> 28:32.914
(general) My people think
they are very close

28:32.916 --> 28:34.749
to regaining control
of this drone.

28:34.751 --> 28:36.351
"Think" isn't
gonna cut it!

28:36.353 --> 28:37.886
We got 60 minutes
to find Gibson

28:37.888 --> 28:39.721
before he kills
thousands of people.

28:39.723 --> 28:41.356
I'm on it.

28:43.193 --> 28:44.926
We're funneling as
many people as we can

28:44.928 --> 28:46.695
through the basement subway
connect, but there's no way

28:46.697 --> 28:48.496
we're gonna evacuate
the whole building in time.

28:48.498 --> 28:50.098
(Weller) Tell me you've figured out
a way to track this guy.

28:50.100 --> 28:51.766
Well, he'd have to be
somewhere pretty high up

28:51.768 --> 28:53.501
to maintain line of sight
with the drone.

28:53.503 --> 28:55.036
Okay, so, we've narrowed
his location down

28:55.038 --> 28:56.504
to somewhere up high?

28:56.506 --> 28:58.406
Well, I've been given access
to the exact frequency

28:58.408 --> 28:59.908
that the drone
communicates on,

28:59.910 --> 29:02.177
and traced the signal's
emanation point to Brooklyn.

29:02.179 --> 29:04.112
- Gibson's home turf.
- That's a lot of ground to cover.

29:04.114 --> 29:07.248
Yes, but the explosives
in Gibson's house

29:07.250 --> 29:10.051
were a very specific grade
of demolition manufactured

29:10.053 --> 29:12.387
exclusively for Garamond
Construction sites.

29:12.389 --> 29:13.788
And guess what?

29:13.790 --> 29:16.024
Gibson worked for
them at two sites...

29:16.026 --> 29:18.426
both new high rises,
both in Brooklyn.

29:18.428 --> 29:20.261

29:34.611 --> 29:38.046

I did remember something.

29:38.048 --> 29:41.016
That's good.

My name's Kurt, all right?

35:53.750 --> 35:55.250
And I'm here
to take you home.

35:55.252 --> 35:57.419
Okay?

35:57.454 --> 35:58.820
Okay.
There we go.

36:03.126 --> 36:07.162
♪♪

36:29.519 --> 36:31.853
(Alex)
Emily!

36:31.855 --> 36:34.022
Daddy!

36:35.992 --> 36:37.359
Are you okay?

36:37.361 --> 36:38.993
We got her back.

36:38.995 --> 36:41.863
Yeah.

36:41.865 --> 36:43.498
We did.

36:57.106 --> 36:58.807
The Eagle Two just
touched down safely.

36:58.809 --> 37:00.542
Air Force is already
spinning the two explosions

37:00.544 --> 37:03.245
as accidents... faulty engine
and a natural gas leak.

37:03.247 --> 37:04.513
The public has a right
to know the truth.

37:04.515 --> 37:07.049
That's not our call.

37:07.051 --> 37:08.383
(Weller) Any more hits on
the tattoo database?

37:08.385 --> 37:09.685
(Patterson)
Not yet.

37:09.687 --> 37:11.486
Wait a minute,
we're not seriously

37:11.488 --> 37:12.854
gonna keep doing this,
are we?

37:12.856 --> 37:15.023
We incited a man
to rampage today.

37:15.025 --> 37:17.159
What, you think he built
a drone control card

37:17.161 --> 37:18.493
and didn't
intend to use it?

37:18.495 --> 37:20.262
He'd been planning this.

37:20.264 --> 37:23.098
And yes, we forced him
to up his timeline.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.933
But if he was able to
wait until he was ready,

37:24.935 --> 37:26.234
there'd be no
stopping him.

37:26.236 --> 37:28.537
So, the tattoos helped.

37:28.539 --> 37:30.005
That's one way
of looking at it.

37:30.007 --> 37:32.407
Okay, that's it for today.

37:35.446 --> 37:37.612
Weller?

37:37.614 --> 37:39.014
Yes, ma'am?

37:39.016 --> 37:41.450
If you think Jane
is Taylor Shaw...

37:41.452 --> 37:43.385
- I do.
- I want to be certain.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.787
I've already ordered
Shaw's old case files

37:45.789 --> 37:47.723
to be sent to our lab.

37:47.725 --> 37:50.959
Patterson can test
Taylor's DNA against Jane's.

37:50.961 --> 37:53.729
It's gonna match.

37:53.731 --> 37:56.231
I don't know.
If she is Taylor,

37:56.233 --> 37:58.533
where has she been
for 25 years?

37:58.535 --> 38:00.635
Where did she
learn these skills?

38:00.637 --> 38:02.637
And why did someone
erase her memory

38:02.639 --> 38:04.239
and send her back to you?

38:04.241 --> 38:05.607
It doesn't
make sense.

38:05.609 --> 38:08.910
It's her.
I can feel it.

38:21.125 --> 38:24.126
Hey.
You okay?

38:24.128 --> 38:26.428
(sighs)

38:26.430 --> 38:28.730
I can't stop
thinking about Gibson.

38:28.732 --> 38:31.933
What he did was terrible,
but some part of him

38:31.935 --> 38:33.668
was just trying to help.

38:33.670 --> 38:36.838
He let vengeance
cloud his thinking.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.508
It's one thing to want
to blow the whistle.

38:39.510 --> 38:41.543
It's another thing
to take lives.

38:46.817 --> 38:48.950
Thank you for what
you said earlier...

38:48.952 --> 38:50.485
about my instincts.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.456
And for everything.

38:54.458 --> 38:58.293
What happened to you
was horrible, Jane.

38:58.295 --> 39:00.028
Good can come of it.

39:00.030 --> 39:02.664
I've been thinking
about it.

39:02.666 --> 39:04.533
I might just be
the messenger,

39:04.535 --> 39:07.969
but your name is
still on my back.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.639
They could've just
said "FBI."

39:10.641 --> 39:12.541
Why would they
send me to you?

39:12.543 --> 39:14.509
I don't know.

39:18.182 --> 39:20.148
(Patterson) We got Chao's
autopsy results back.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.550
We found elevated levels

39:21.552 --> 39:23.218
of potassium chloride
in his system.

39:23.220 --> 39:24.786
What does that mean?

39:24.788 --> 39:26.555
He was poisoned.

39:26.557 --> 39:28.056
Someone went through
a lot of trouble

39:28.058 --> 39:29.491
to keep him
from talking to us.

39:29.493 --> 39:32.694
The doctor, the one
that was walking away.

39:32.696 --> 39:34.996
Canvassed the whole hospital,
no one could place him.

39:43.307 --> 39:45.540
Oh, my God.

39:45.542 --> 39:47.709
We have no proof yet.

39:47.711 --> 39:49.478
We're trying to verify it
with some DNA

39:49.480 --> 39:51.179
from Taylor's case files.

39:51.181 --> 39:55.250
Well, you realize what this...
this could mean, right?

39:55.252 --> 39:57.185
I mean, Dad's been
accused of kidnapping her,

39:57.187 --> 39:59.020
of killing her.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.422
It didn't matter
they couldn't prove it,

40:00.424 --> 40:01.723
he's had it hanging
over his head

40:01.725 --> 40:03.358
since the day
she disappeared.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.994
Mom left him.

40:05.996 --> 40:08.730
Kurt, you spent 25 years
convinced Dad committed

40:08.732 --> 40:10.632
a murder that
never even happened.

40:13.737 --> 40:16.771
If Jane Doe is Taylor Shaw,
then Dad is innocent.

40:16.773 --> 40:17.873
Maybe.

40:17.875 --> 40:20.742
No, Kurt, not maybe!

40:20.744 --> 40:24.246
You have to go see him.

40:24.248 --> 40:26.281
- Sarah...
- He's dying.

40:28.252 --> 40:31.887
It's lung cancer,
he doesn't have long.

40:34.558 --> 40:38.193
Please, just go see him.

40:38.195 --> 40:41.229
You can fix this
before it's too late.

40:59.249 --> 41:00.615
(shower running)

41:04.955 --> 41:06.321
(sighs)

41:07.324 --> 41:09.090
(panicked breathing)

41:09.092 --> 41:12.360
Don't... don't
make a sound.
