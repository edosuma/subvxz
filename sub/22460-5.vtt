00:18.040 --> 00:21.323
Hello. Happy Christmas.

00:21.324 --> 00:22.804
Can I come in yet, Mark?

00:22.805 --> 00:24.446
Yes, you can come in yet.

00:24.447 --> 00:28.290
There, um...there wasn't anything at
the end of my bed when I woke up.

00:28.291 --> 00:29.251
It's in here.

00:29.252 --> 00:31.854
Oh, brilliant. And you saw?

00:31.855 --> 00:34.897
Yes, yes, you woke me at
5.30 when you came in.

00:34.898 --> 00:37.140
I've been trying to get
to sleep since 6.00

00:37.141 --> 00:40.183
by reading about Wilson's
trade union reforms, but...

00:40.184 --> 00:41.865
Marr is so damn readable.

00:41.866 --> 00:44.507
Shit. Sorry, dude. Ooh!

00:44.508 --> 00:47.551
Slim but promising, Mark!
Slim but promising!

00:47.552 --> 00:49.112
Jez, what are you...?

00:49.113 --> 00:50.874
We're going to open
them in bed, aren't we?

00:50.875 --> 00:51.915
What if our feet touch?

00:51.916 --> 00:54.678
What if our feet touch?
If our feet touch, we fuck, obviously.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.962
Come on! Dive in!
Let the festivities begin!

00:57.963 --> 01:00.885
Wow! Jez, this is lovely.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.248
Cognac. Wow. That's my favourite.

01:03.249 --> 01:06.531
I know. Ooh, smells interesting!

01:06.532 --> 01:09.454
It looks like fire-lighters,
but what is it?

01:09.455 --> 01:10.856
Fire-lighters.

01:10.857 --> 01:13.138
In case we get a barbecue?

01:13.139 --> 01:14.980
Outside, on the...bit.

01:14.981 --> 01:16.542
Oh...

01:16.543 --> 01:20.026
Right.

01:20.027 --> 01:21.427
Roy Adkins on Trafalgar?

01:21.428 --> 01:22.588
I heard you talking about it!

01:22.589 --> 01:26.312
That's just tremendously
thoughtful, Jeremy.

01:26.313 --> 01:27.474
What are these?

01:27.475 --> 01:29.236
Kitchen tongs. We need them.

01:29.237 --> 01:33.240
You bought yourself
some kitchen tongs?

01:33.601 --> 01:37.605
Oh, and yes, I remember you getting
this ScotRail sleeping mask

01:37.966 --> 01:40.648
when you went on ScotRail
overnight to Aberdeen.

01:40.649 --> 01:44.652
Yeah. Yeah. That's right.

01:46.015 --> 01:50.018
You know, in my family we
do sort of jokey stockings.

01:50.980 --> 01:54.783
Right. In mine we sort
of try quite hard.

01:54.784 --> 01:57.626
'He's trying to strangle my
Christmas with Sellotape.'

01:57.627 --> 01:58.747
I might save the rest.

01:58.748 --> 02:01.430
'It's not fair.
That's just aggressive generosity

02:01.431 --> 02:02.832
'designed to make me feel bad.'

02:02.833 --> 02:05.434
Sorry, it's just this is my
first Christmas without Mum...

02:05.435 --> 02:09.157
Cos she's sailing round the Med with
Mr Potato Head. Yes, I know, Jez.

02:09.158 --> 02:12.722
Oh, wow, so you got it in, in the end?

02:12.723 --> 02:13.924
It's quite a specimen.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.285
Mmm-hmm. Quite a specimen.

02:15.286 --> 02:17.768
I thought about trimming the
top off but it felt like I was

02:17.769 --> 02:20.851
castrating Christmas, you know?
Chopping Santa's bollocks off.

02:20.852 --> 02:21.652
Sure.

02:21.653 --> 02:24.215
You're not going to cry, are you?

02:24.216 --> 02:28.219
I'm fine, it's just even though
I'm looking at the tree,

02:28.300 --> 02:30.742
I'm just not...
I'm not getting it yet.

02:30.743 --> 02:31.863
Horny?

02:31.864 --> 02:32.944
Horny?
Christmassy, Mark.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.066
I'm not getting the
Christmassy feeling.

02:35.067 --> 02:39.071
Let's crank up Classic FM.
Let's get our Christmas on!

02:39.152 --> 02:43.155
Now, Sarah, if I scrape together
the shortbread from Aberdeen '09

02:45.519 --> 02:47.760
and this unread SuperFreakonomics

02:47.761 --> 02:50.283
we can pretend I thought she'd
like, even though I'm pretty sure

02:50.284 --> 02:52.805
she'll hate it, then that's an
acceptable bundle, isn't it?

02:52.806 --> 02:54.247
Nice to have your family
here for Christmas.

02:54.248 --> 02:57.691
Well, not really.
But the point is, I'm in charge!

02:57.692 --> 02:59.853
I've launched the Christmas putsch.

02:59.854 --> 03:03.417
I carve the turkey, I decide what veg we have.
No cauliflower.

03:03.418 --> 03:05.499
No-one else has it,
it's not a tradition.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.781
Christmas is coming home!
Ding Dong Merrily on Mark!

03:07.782 --> 03:11.786
Exactly. Right, we need to get
the oven on for lunch at one.

03:12.307 --> 03:14.148
Yeah, right! Lunch is at three.

03:14.149 --> 03:15.590
You do presents first and then...

03:15.591 --> 03:16.831
No, Jez. Presents after.

03:16.832 --> 03:19.955
Then charades. Then the lull, the
Low Countries, then the row,

03:19.956 --> 03:23.278
the cold cuts, then, bang!
Into a blockbuster to see you home!

03:23.279 --> 03:25.761
But that's not my
Christmas, because...

03:25.762 --> 03:26.522
Well, that's what we're doing.

03:26.523 --> 03:29.245
'Don't let him spoil it.
Don't let him rile me.

03:29.246 --> 03:32.248
'Not today. Not on Christmas!'

03:32.249 --> 03:33.809
Where's the turkey, Jeremy?

03:33.810 --> 03:35.651
What?The turkey. Where's the turkey?

03:35.652 --> 03:36.973
I thought you were getting the turkey.

03:36.974 --> 03:39.175
You what?

03:39.176 --> 03:41.298
No turkey?!
You fucking idiot, Jeremy!

03:41.299 --> 03:43.300
You total fucking idiot!

03:43.301 --> 03:46.303
That was your job, you fucking moron!
You cretin!

03:46.304 --> 03:50.067
You're a fuckhead! That's what you are!
A fucking shithead!

03:50.068 --> 03:51.949
It was a joke, Mark.

03:51.950 --> 03:54.392
I was joking.

03:54.393 --> 03:58.076
It was a Christmas joke.

03:58.077 --> 04:01.039
Oh, I see. Oh.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.922
Of course I've got a turkey.
It's an organic turkey.

04:03.923 --> 04:07.926
I took ages researching it online.
It's going to be delicious.

04:08.408 --> 04:11.490
That looks like a lovely turkey.

04:11.491 --> 04:14.213
I'm sorry. I...
flew off the handle a bit.

04:14.214 --> 04:16.055
That wasn't very Christmassy.

04:16.055 --> 04:20.059
No, it wasn't. I apologise.

04:21.862 --> 04:25.865
'Wow, she's really sweaty.
A lovely, sweaty Christmas gift.'

04:25.906 --> 04:28.148
I shouldn't hang around too long.
I've got to get ready

04:28.149 --> 04:31.592
for a day out with the folks.
Stomach pump for Mum.

04:31.593 --> 04:34.114
Taser to demobilise Dad. Families!

04:34.115 --> 04:37.798
God, yeah! The year Dad's British
Aerospace shares went kaput,

04:37.799 --> 04:39.961
he said we couldn't afford
an M&S Christmas pudding,

04:39.962 --> 04:43.645
but Mum bought a secret one
and steamed it in the garage.

04:43.646 --> 04:46.167
We would've got away with it, but
he smelt it on Sarah's breath

04:46.168 --> 04:48.850
and wouldn't talk to
us till Boxing Day.

04:48.851 --> 04:50.812
God. Dads!

04:50.813 --> 04:54.616
Huh! Yeah. Right.

04:54.617 --> 04:55.738
So... Happy Christmas!

04:55.739 --> 04:56.979
Oh, wow...

04:56.980 --> 04:59.141
Thanks.

04:59.142 --> 05:01.264
Happy Christmas.

05:01.265 --> 05:04.267
It's just a little thing.
I did get you another thing

05:04.268 --> 05:07.590
but the stupid thing
didn't arrive in time.

05:07.591 --> 05:08.712
Oh. Right.

05:08.713 --> 05:10.073
It is gold.

05:10.074 --> 05:12.436
Oh! Well, that sounds nice.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.558
Can't go wrong with precious metals,

05:14.559 --> 05:17.481
cos when civilisation collapses,
I can use it to barter

05:17.482 --> 05:19.203
my way out of sexual assaults!

05:19.204 --> 05:21.045
Ha! Exactly!

05:21.046 --> 05:23.287
'Probably take the
gold, then shoot her.'

05:23.288 --> 05:25.770
Oh, right, yeah.

05:25.771 --> 05:27.492
FlashForward box set.

05:27.493 --> 05:31.056
It's meant to be amazing.
Shall we do it this week?

05:31.057 --> 05:34.419
Sure, it's just...

05:34.420 --> 05:38.423
we watched all the Losts and they were...
somewhat OK.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.986
And Heroes had some
interesting themes,

05:40.987 --> 05:44.470
but also quite a lot of not
so interesting themes.

05:44.471 --> 05:48.474
And Prison Break - by the end I
very much felt I wanted to break

05:49.957 --> 05:52.999
out of the prison that Prison
Break had become for us...

05:53.000 --> 05:57.003
and it's just...
don't you think, maybe we should...go out?

05:57.605 --> 05:58.765
Where to?

05:58.766 --> 06:00.607
To...not the theatre, obviously.

06:00.608 --> 06:03.931
But...the National Army Museum?

06:03.932 --> 06:07.014
You'd rather go to the National
Army Museum than stay in bed

06:07.015 --> 06:10.218
and watch FlashForward and drink brandy?
Are you bonkers?

06:10.219 --> 06:12.941
Dobby, where do you see
yourself in five years?

06:12.942 --> 06:16.945
I mean, for example, would you want
to learn sailing at all? Or golf?

06:18.588 --> 06:21.590
I wouldn't mind getting a strap-on
and you and me spit-roasting

06:21.591 --> 06:23.272
Cameron for the Boden catalogue.

06:23.273 --> 06:25.474
Is that the sort of
thing you have in mind?

06:25.475 --> 06:26.595
She is great. But where does it end?

06:26.596 --> 06:28.077
PHONE RINGS

06:28.078 --> 06:31.040
With us sailing the Caribbean,
checking our pension pot online?

06:31.041 --> 06:33.843
Or much more likely, trying to
scrape a living on pub quiz machines

06:33.844 --> 06:37.487
from our vast knowledge of
popular culture and bar snacks?

06:37.488 --> 06:39.289
Oh, man!

06:39.290 --> 06:39.729
What?

06:39.730 --> 06:41.732
My sister's car's broken down.

06:41.733 --> 06:45.295
She got to my Mum and Dad in Lancaster
but they're stuck at Charnock Richard.

06:45.296 --> 06:46.256
Oh, shit.

06:46.257 --> 06:49.059
I'm not going to the Dorchester
to eat Christmas lunch on my own

06:49.060 --> 06:50.461
like a millionaire madwoman.

06:50.462 --> 06:51.142
Hmm.

06:51.143 --> 06:53.144
'Should invite her to stay here...

06:53.145 --> 06:55.066
'And I've missed the moment.

06:55.067 --> 06:57.709
'Right there. Missed it.'

06:57.710 --> 07:01.032
'I'm already going to have a
nervous breakdown with my family

07:01.033 --> 07:02.594
'and "Tiny Tim" Jeremy and the turkey.

07:02.595 --> 07:05.597
'Why add a dangerous unstable
chemical into the mix?

07:05.598 --> 07:06.839
Kitchen tongs?

07:06.840 --> 07:07.840
Oh, yeah! Two for one.

07:07.841 --> 07:09.481
Right, well...

07:09.482 --> 07:12.805
Listen, I guess I should saddle
up and ride back to my place.

07:12.806 --> 07:16.048
'If I can just get through
the next seconds ignoring

07:16.049 --> 07:17.690
'the mounting social pressure.'

07:17.691 --> 07:19.652
I'll see if Mr Patel has any turkeys,

07:19.653 --> 07:22.015
which obviously, he definitely won't.

07:22.016 --> 07:24.377
'Pressure...building...
to intolerable levels!'

07:24.378 --> 07:25.418
Dobby.

07:25.419 --> 07:26.019
Yeah?

07:26.020 --> 07:28.181
I assume you're staying for lunch?

07:28.182 --> 07:30.544
Right...you didn't say.

07:30.545 --> 07:32.546
Because I thought it was assumed.

07:32.547 --> 07:35.269
All right, well, thanks.

07:35.270 --> 07:36.350
I'll just jump in the shower.

07:36.351 --> 07:37.271
Jump away!

07:37.272 --> 07:39.073
'Could lock her in the bathroom...

07:39.074 --> 07:40.755
'Shit, no lock on the outside.'

07:40.756 --> 07:43.478
You are putting the little crosses
in the bottoms, aren't you, Jeremy?

07:43.479 --> 07:44.519
Yeah, course.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.242
'Don't think I'll be bothering with that!
Happy Christmas to me.'

07:47.243 --> 07:49.484
Now, obviously this is
a fucking disaster,

07:49.485 --> 07:51.567
but Dobby's staying. For Christmas.

07:51.568 --> 07:53.088
Right. Lovely. The more the merrier.

07:53.089 --> 07:55.090
Exactly.
The more the merrier, as they said

07:55.091 --> 07:59.095
as another poor soul was crammed
into the Black Hole of Calcutta.

07:59.736 --> 08:01.577
Jeremy, where are the potatoes?

08:01.578 --> 08:03.179
No idea, dude. Not my area.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.501
But you were on turkey and veg.

08:04.502 --> 08:05.622
Potatoes aren't veg.

08:05.623 --> 08:06.743
Er...yes, they are.

08:06.744 --> 08:10.747
N... Are they? I mean, they
kind of are, but not really.

08:10.828 --> 08:11.989
Well, what else are they?

08:11.990 --> 08:13.430
Are you sure potatoes are veg?

08:13.431 --> 08:16.914
Aren't they...not earth, but...
like salt?

08:16.915 --> 08:20.918
I mean, tomatoes are fruit and
potatoes are...bread? No.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.241
I mean, they're wheaty.

08:23.242 --> 08:26.284
They don't go in the drawer
in the fridge, so...yeah?

08:26.285 --> 08:28.526
Jeremy, obviously,
potatoes are vegetables.

08:28.527 --> 08:30.048
Well, now you're going on
about it, maybe you're right,

08:30.049 --> 08:33.611
but they're not exactly cabbage, are they?
I mean, they're brown. They're nice.

08:33.613 --> 08:34.653
Oh, for fuck's sake!

08:34.654 --> 08:37.256
Oh, for fuck's sake! Look, there must be potatoes.
There's always potatoes.

08:37.256 --> 08:40.058
Yes. We do have potatoes.
Two potatoes.

08:40.059 --> 08:42.702
Two? Oh, that's not enough.

08:42.703 --> 08:44.664
I love potatoes.
They're the best bit!

08:44.665 --> 08:47.707
Everything's the best bit according
to you - croissants, cava,

08:47.708 --> 08:51.391
smoked salmon, pineapple rings, having
the heating on incredibly high.

08:51.392 --> 08:53.193
Everything all right?

08:53.194 --> 08:55.115
Yes, everything's absolutely perfect,

08:55.116 --> 08:58.238
apart from the fact that Jeremy has
forgotten to buy any potatoes.

08:58.239 --> 08:59.400
Well, I've got potatoes at mine.

08:59.401 --> 09:01.482
Plus, really, for your mum and
dad, I should get changed.

09:01.483 --> 09:03.003
Oh, no need.

09:03.004 --> 09:07.008
Yes. A nice, standard issue
British woman's dress.

09:09.491 --> 09:10.812
Welcome back. You look great.

09:10.813 --> 09:12.053
Thanks.

09:12.054 --> 09:14.135
Jeans. For Christmas.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.099
At least it's not hot pants
and her ironic iPood T-shirt.

09:17.100 --> 09:20.422
That's mad, Mum! Christmas in Malta?
30 degrees! >

09:21.584 --> 09:23.946
What do you mean, you're
not having turkey?

09:23.947 --> 09:26.549
Well, you could make it
on the boat if you...

09:26.550 --> 09:28.190
Oh, OK. Yeah.

09:28.191 --> 09:32.195
All right. Bye. Happy Christmas!

09:32.476 --> 09:35.198
They're having salade
nicoise for Christmas.

09:35.199 --> 09:38.321
Salade nicoise.
That's not turkey.

09:38.322 --> 09:40.003
It's not even chicken.

09:40.004 --> 09:41.805
I'm going to have a massive drink.

09:41.806 --> 09:44.368
'Don't break down on Christmas!
Break down on Boxing Day,

09:44.369 --> 09:45.849
'once the washing-up's done.'

09:45.850 --> 09:47.972
I'm excited to meet
your parents, Mark.

09:47.973 --> 09:50.535
After everything you've told
me, it's like they're famous.

09:50.536 --> 09:54.098
It's like I'm gonna meet the head of IBM and...
Catwoman or something.

09:54.099 --> 09:55.980
Uh-huh.

09:55.981 --> 09:59.865
'Incredibly wasteful peeling
technique, but now is not the time.'

09:59.866 --> 10:03.869
So, listen, Dobby.
There's something I wanted to tell you.

10:04.350 --> 10:07.273
I haven't actually happened
to mention to my parents

10:07.274 --> 10:09.515
or my sister that I'm engaged...

10:09.516 --> 10:11.677
in a relationship.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.079
But it's been, like, over a month.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.803
Yeah, but it's not like I tell
them every tiny detail of my life.

10:16.804 --> 10:20.807
And I was just wondering whether
today, with all the madness...

10:20.808 --> 10:21.528
What madness?

10:21.529 --> 10:23.490
Everything. The carrots.

10:23.491 --> 10:24.451
Uh-huh.

10:24.452 --> 10:27.014
..I just wonder whether
we shouldn't...

10:27.015 --> 10:31.018
Wouldn't it be simpler just to not
tell them that we're going out?

10:31.540 --> 10:33.260
Right...

10:33.261 --> 10:34.782
I mean, we're still early days...

10:34.783 --> 10:35.343
Uh-huh.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.544
Not like that,

10:36.545 --> 10:40.548
but it's been such a headache getting
them here in the first place

10:41.030 --> 10:43.271
and I don't want to feed
them another shit sandwich.

10:43.272 --> 10:44.993
Anothershitsandwich?

10:44.994 --> 10:47.796
Not you! The whole...situation.

10:47.797 --> 10:51.400
So I'm going to be your female friend?
Your fan?

10:51.401 --> 10:54.163
Oh, God, what am I going to do next?
Set fire to the tree?

10:54.164 --> 10:56.566
Maybe we should have salade nicoise.

10:56.567 --> 10:58.928
Why the fuck not? Who even cares?

10:58.929 --> 11:00.249
DOORBELL RINGS

11:00.250 --> 11:04.254
OK. Enemy contact. This is it.
Action stations, everyone.

11:05.856 --> 11:07.457
Happy Christmas, one and all!

11:07.458 --> 11:08.178
Hello!

11:08.179 --> 11:10.340
Happy Christmas, Mark. I'm shattered.
Can I have a glass of champagne?

11:10.341 --> 11:12.102
Happy Christmas, Mark. I'm shattered. Can I have a
glass of champagne? Of course. Cava's through there.

11:12.103 --> 11:13.944
Cava? Oh. >

11:13.945 --> 11:17.388
'Great. Five seconds before the first
disappointment. Got that in early.'

11:17.389 --> 11:18.549
Happy Christmas, darling.

11:18.550 --> 11:21.632
Happy Christmas, Mark. Yup.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.234
And you know Jeremy, obviously.

11:23.235 --> 11:25.036
Happy Christmas, Corrigans!Ah!

11:25.037 --> 11:26.758
And this is our...friend.

11:26.759 --> 11:28.480
Hello.

11:28.481 --> 11:29.441
I'm Dobby.

11:29.442 --> 11:31.643
We...know each other.

11:31.644 --> 11:32.925
As you do.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.447
'It's fine.
Luckily we're all English,

11:35.448 --> 11:37.329
'so no-one's going to
ask any questions.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.732
'Thank you, centuries of
emotional repression.'

11:39.733 --> 11:40.813
Hello, Jeremy.

11:40.814 --> 11:42.134
Hello, Sarah. Happy Christmas.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.576
It could be.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.498
If you play your cards right.

11:45.499 --> 11:47.741
Urgh. Not Sarah...not again.

11:47.742 --> 11:51.344
'Ding Dong Merrily on my dong, the
Christmas elves are weeping.'

11:51.345 --> 11:54.948
Long time no see, Mrs C. How are you doing?
What have you been up to?

11:54.949 --> 11:56.190
Oh, I just finished another play.

11:56.191 --> 11:58.352
Oh, wow. Another one, Mum?

11:58.353 --> 11:59.874
Yes. Another one.

11:59.875 --> 12:03.437
Wow. You're a playwright?
Brilliant. What's it about?

12:03.438 --> 12:07.442
It's about this group of young people
who are very sexually repressed,

12:09.285 --> 12:13.168
but they become less and less
repressed due to the influence >

12:13.169 --> 12:16.531
of this wise, twinkly
old Jamaican woman,

12:16.532 --> 12:19.294
who leads them through a
series of experiences.

12:19.295 --> 12:22.978
You've got to have a Jamaican if
you're going to chase the funding.

12:22.979 --> 12:26.783
(COCKNEY ACCENT) Elf
and safety, innit?

12:26.784 --> 12:28.705
Shall we...shall we pull a cracker?

12:28.706 --> 12:31.187
We can't do the crackers
until we sit at the table!

12:31.188 --> 12:33.229
Crackers once you sit,
that's the rule!

12:33.230 --> 12:34.871
OK. Sorry. OK, Jeremy.

12:34.872 --> 12:38.195
I'm fine, it's just...
I'm trying to feel Christmassy and...

12:38.196 --> 12:40.397
Oh, for fudge's sake!

12:40.398 --> 12:42.640
It's OK, Dad, the carpet's seen worse.

12:42.641 --> 12:46.644
You Jezzed the Cava just like
you Jezzed the directions, Dad!

12:47.205 --> 12:48.846
Erm, Jezzed?

12:48.847 --> 12:50.928
We got it from Mark, didn't we, Mark?

12:50.929 --> 12:54.132
Oh, right. So...
it's when you...?

12:54.133 --> 12:55.774
When you get something wrong.
He Jezzed it.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.897
Total balls-up, a real Jezzing!

12:58.898 --> 13:01.620
Right. Yeah. Yeah, that is funny.

13:01.621 --> 13:03.302
It's a bit like being famous.

13:03.303 --> 13:04.303
DOORBELL RINGS

13:04.304 --> 13:06.906
I'll see who that is.
Let's hope I don't Jezz it

13:06.907 --> 13:09.308
or do a big Mark in my pants.

13:09.309 --> 13:12.071
Happy Christmas, motherfucker.

13:12.072 --> 13:12.912
Hans!

13:12.913 --> 13:16.075
Hans! Have a guess what
Santa's got in his sack.

13:16.076 --> 13:20.080
Answer - a wicked big bag
of sinister minister.

13:20.361 --> 13:22.683
Oh... Happy Christmas.

13:22.684 --> 13:23.323
Hans?

13:23.324 --> 13:24.364
Hans?
Merry Christmas, Mark.

13:24.365 --> 13:25.085
Hans? Merry Christmas, Mark.
Jeremy...

13:25.086 --> 13:26.126
I'm not going to.

13:26.127 --> 13:27.207
Well, don't.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.850
Super Hans! Merry Christmas!
Glass of Cava?

13:29.851 --> 13:31.933
Don't mind if I do. Mind out, boys,

13:31.934 --> 13:33.935
Father Spliffmas coming through.

13:33.936 --> 13:36.137
'Great.
Methadone in the mulled wine.'

13:36.138 --> 13:37.058
What?

13:37.059 --> 13:37.859
It's your fault.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.781
It's not my fault, I
was holding the line.

13:39.782 --> 13:43.145
Yes, but you know him.
You shouldn't know him.

13:43.146 --> 13:45.627
Well, I'm sorry but I do know him.

13:45.628 --> 13:48.630
'Oh. Merry migraine and a
happy new stomach ulcer.'

13:48.672 --> 13:53.476
So, what sort of line of
business are you in, Super Hans?

13:53.557 --> 13:58.661
At the moment, I take out fireplaces
and so on from empty houses.

13:58.742 --> 14:00.423
Architectural salvage.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.464
Yeah.

14:01.565 --> 14:03.286
And do you sell to trade or wholesale?

14:03.287 --> 14:04.968
I sell them in pubs and that.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.170
He's training to be an architect.

14:07.171 --> 14:10.294
No, I'm not.

14:10.295 --> 14:11.455
And what do you do, Dobby?

14:11.456 --> 14:13.898
IT grunt.

14:13.899 --> 14:15.499
And do you have a boyfriend at all?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.141
Kind of.

14:17.142 --> 14:20.785
I like him but sometimes he can
be a bit of a jerk and so on.

14:20.786 --> 14:22.026
Oh.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.788
He seems cool, but really,

14:23.789 --> 14:26.311
he can be kind of cowardly
and mean and do things

14:26.312 --> 14:29.154
and do things that humiliate
me and then I think,

14:29.155 --> 14:30.756
"Why don't you just..."

14:30.757 --> 14:31.517
Don't say, "Fuck off."

14:31.518 --> 14:33.279
"..Fuck off." You know?

14:33.280 --> 14:35.201
"Just fuck off."

14:35.202 --> 14:37.003
'Oh, this is horrible.

14:37.004 --> 14:40.126
'She's found a way of telling
me her true feelings. Sneaky.'

14:40.127 --> 14:44.130
Happy Christmas, darling. Here we go.
It's just a silly one.

14:44.612 --> 14:48.615
Oh, socks! Nice. Thanks, Mum.

14:48.976 --> 14:50.657
And they've got a funny...

14:50.658 --> 14:52.499
Oh. OK.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.541
They're a bit saucy!

14:54.542 --> 14:56.303
'My mother is giving
me socks depicting

14:56.304 --> 14:58.906
'a sexual position I have
never even attempted.

Oi, Mrs C, answer me this...

Have you ever had a parrot?

15:04.793 --> 15:06.234
Er, no.

15:06.235 --> 15:08.797
It's just you look like you
might enjoy a cock-a-too.

Oh! That's very cheeky, Hans.

Here you go, Marko. Merry Christmas.

15:23.133 --> 15:27.136
Wow. This is big, Dad, and heavy.

15:28.899 --> 15:32.903
Oh, right, I...I see. Yeah. Great.

15:33.464 --> 15:35.946
Yeah, this is...this is brilliant.

15:35.947 --> 15:37.347
What is it? >

15:37.348 --> 15:40.711
It's...it's a shredder.

15:40.712 --> 15:42.273
It's my dad's old shredder.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.035
But you've already got a shredder.

15:44.036 --> 15:46.077
Why are you looking at me like that?

15:46.078 --> 15:47.438
Like what?

15:47.439 --> 15:50.161
Like you're trying to fry my
brain with your laser vision.

15:50.162 --> 15:52.083
'Please shut up.'So...wow.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.966
Sarah got the cashmere
jumper and the spa break

15:54.967 --> 15:57.329
and Mark got the
second-hand shredder.

15:57.330 --> 15:58.410
What did he do wrong?

15:58.411 --> 16:01.253
'Why did she have to say?
I'm going out with a "sayer".'

16:01.254 --> 16:04.697
'The sayers say they can't
help saying, but they can!'

16:04.698 --> 16:06.699
Apparently, if it was new,

16:06.700 --> 16:09.982
which it nearly is, it would be
roughly the same cash value.

16:09.983 --> 16:13.867
'This is nice. I might bite my
tongue off to relieve the tension.

16:13.868 --> 16:16.269
'Give us something to talk about.

16:17.712 --> 16:20.354
It's just resting in the shop, Dad,

16:20.355 --> 16:23.637
due to the fact that cauliflower
is not traditional.

I don't want to talk
about it, OK, Mark?

16:32.488 --> 16:34.088
Christmas is not ruined.

16:34.089 --> 16:35.530
It's OK, Jez.

16:35.531 --> 16:37.652
A great deal of it is cooked.

16:37.653 --> 16:39.775
Huge areas are cooked through.

16:39.776 --> 16:42.257
'Fashionably rare?'

Why always Chariots Of Fire, Mum?

16:48.345 --> 16:52.348
It's the only one I could think of.
I don't even like it. I know.

Here's one...
(WHISPERS) Thus Spake Zarathustra.

17:25.665 --> 17:26.984
Excuse me?

17:26.986 --> 17:29.388
It's a book by Nietzsche.

17:29.389 --> 17:31.710
'Oh, great. Fucking thanks, Dan(!)'

17:31.711 --> 17:35.715
'Thus? No. Spake? No.
Zarathustra? Nope.'

17:38.639 --> 17:39.879
Chicken Run.Correct.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.281
But...'Fuck you, Dan.'

17:41.282 --> 17:45.285
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you said Chicken Run.

17:47.208 --> 17:51.211
SHREDDER WHIRRS

17:52.013 --> 17:54.255
I guess it is time to
move to cross-cut.

17:54.256 --> 17:57.538
My old strip-cut was probably a
security risk, to be honest.

17:57.539 --> 17:59.500
That's a real shredder,
not a nancy-boy shredder.

17:59.501 --> 18:01.943

Er, Jeremy, the, um...

18:15.679 --> 18:19.682
the turkey's not...
entirely...cooked.

18:19.683 --> 18:23.005
No. Carve off the bits that are
cooked and leave the rest.

18:23.006 --> 18:24.928
That's what carving's for.

18:24.929 --> 18:27.090
Then we will put the
carcass under the grill.

18:27.091 --> 18:28.652
Ooh, what's wrong with my knife?

18:28.653 --> 18:31.054
Is that hot knives?

18:31.055 --> 18:32.215
What's a hot knife?Nothing.

18:32.216 --> 18:33.977
Looks like it's been hot-knifed.

18:33.978 --> 18:36.019
Sorry about that. There you go.

18:36.020 --> 18:39.784
You get a blim of hash and get
it between two really hot knives

18:39.785 --> 18:42.306
and then honk it up through
a bottle or something.

18:42.307 --> 18:44.749
I think.

18:44.750 --> 18:45.830
Ha-ha.

18:45.831 --> 18:49.834
Next up, we'll be learning how to
inject heroin into our armpits!

'Oh, God. Foot in the crotch.
This isn't very Nat King Cole.

18:56.082 --> 19:00.045
'But I'm getting a hard-on anyway,
like the horny Christmas elf I am.

19:00.046 --> 19:01.367
'How pathetic.'

19:01.368 --> 19:05.171
It's nice. I think Pam and I'll take
a break till after lunch, Hans.

19:05.172 --> 19:05.491
Isn't that right, darling?

19:05.492 --> 19:09.495
Isn't that right, darling?
If you say so.

19:09.496 --> 19:12.859
Have these sprouts been
done properly?Yes.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.342
I can't see any little
crosses in their bottoms.

19:15.343 --> 19:17.985
They're definitely there.Yep.

19:17.986 --> 19:21.829
'Definitely not. Truth and
reconciliation commission after this.

19:21.830 --> 19:24.311
'Full inquiry. Saville, not Hutton.'

19:24.312 --> 19:27.595
Well, that piece was definitely cooked.
Delicious, Jeremy.

19:27.596 --> 19:28.756
Thank you, Pam.

19:28.757 --> 19:30.878
'Maybe it's going to be OK.'

19:30.879 --> 19:33.361
Mmm! Mmm!

19:33.362 --> 19:36.244
This gravy is tickety-boo.

19:36.245 --> 19:38.887
Maybe a bit too thick for your mother.

19:38.888 --> 19:41.650
She likes her liquids highly diluted.

19:41.651 --> 19:43.492
'Nope. We're fucked.'

19:43.493 --> 19:45.534
Oh, for God's sake, Dad.What?

19:45.535 --> 19:47.136
Mum wanted to become a homeopath,

19:47.137 --> 19:49.939
but according to Dad, the
family couldn't afford it.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.862
I know it's not normal, but we could
put the TV on while we eat...

19:52.863 --> 19:56.866
We couldn't afford for her to become
a magic water wizard, I'm sorry.

19:57.148 --> 19:59.910
It was just a fad.

19:59.911 --> 20:02.312
It was a great deal more than a fad.

20:02.313 --> 20:06.317
Mm! Yum! Jeremy may have let
us down a bit with the turkey

20:07.279 --> 20:10.401
but he's redeemed himself with
this delicious bread sauce.

20:10.402 --> 20:12.203
You had enough to buy a sports car.

20:12.204 --> 20:13.885
Carl would've sold that MG for scrap.

20:13.886 --> 20:17.408
Don't bring the MG into it.
You don't know what you're talking about.

20:17.409 --> 20:20.572
Ratatouille is on in a minute.
It's meant to be amazing.

20:20.573 --> 20:22.494
Fair play, it is fucking good.

20:22.495 --> 20:26.498
Second-hand MG?
Got to be a couple of grand.

20:26.539 --> 20:30.543
It was a good deal on
a good car, Missy.

20:33.186 --> 20:37.030
So, Dobby, have you had any good
Christmas presents this year?

20:37.031 --> 20:39.993
Well, my boyfriend bought
me some kitchen tongs...

20:39.994 --> 20:42.556
'Two for one.
Nice work, Uncle Scrooge.'

20:42.557 --> 20:45.318
That wasn't the only present he got
you, was it, Dobby, as I recall?

20:45.319 --> 20:49.323
Oh, yeah, he bought me something
else, gold, but it's in the post.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.406
Oh, dear.

20:52.407 --> 20:56.410
Look, I'm sure Dobby's boyfriend
could have strolled into an Argos

20:56.852 --> 21:00.855
and got a bog standard bracelet
from a spotty Saturday girl,

21:01.177 --> 21:03.858
but maybe he wanted to get
something a little bit special.

21:03.859 --> 21:07.062
Something with an inscription
that would make it extra special,

21:07.063 --> 21:09.945
but also would unexpectedly
delay delivery.

21:09.946 --> 21:12.147
That's just one of a number
of possibilities, right,

21:12.148 --> 21:14.990
so shall we all just lay off him?

21:14.991 --> 21:16.632
Hello.

21:16.633 --> 21:19.996
Touched a nerve?

21:19.997 --> 21:22.599
Something's afoot.

21:22.600 --> 21:26.603
Shall I see if I can winkle it
out with my winkle-pickers?

21:26.804 --> 21:28.725
'Fuck you, Poirot.'

21:28.726 --> 21:30.928
Look, I'm the bracelet bastard.

21:30.929 --> 21:31.728
Oh!

21:31.729 --> 21:34.091
Dobby's my girlfriend. All right?

21:34.092 --> 21:38.095
Sorry I didn't mention it before,
but we're an item and she's great

21:38.377 --> 21:42.380
and it's going really well, and
she may appear to you "norms"

21:43.662 --> 21:47.545
like a bit of a freak,
but I don't care.

21:47.546 --> 21:50.268
'He shoots, he scores, he
calls his team-mate a freak.'

21:50.269 --> 21:53.952
Right.

21:53.953 --> 21:55.594
Now, where's the cauliflower?

21:55.595 --> 21:58.037
Cauliflower is not traditional.

21:58.038 --> 22:02.041
Cauliflower is traditional!

22:05.045 --> 22:08.448
I don't know if it really
is traditional, actually.

22:08.449 --> 22:12.452
Could you not slip a muzzle
on your woman, please, Mark?

22:16.818 --> 22:19.420
'I notice I'm not saying anything.'

22:19.421 --> 22:20.941
Ahhhh...

22:20.942 --> 22:23.985
'Still not saying anything.

22:23.986 --> 22:26.667
'Nothing coming.

22:26.668 --> 22:30.672
You'll have to excuse me. Thank you.
This has all been horrible.

22:35.358 --> 22:37.239
How about Pictionary after lunch?

22:37.240 --> 22:41.243
We're not playing bleeding Pictionary.
It's a made-up game.

22:45.048 --> 22:46.609
Dobs...I'm going.

22:46.610 --> 22:50.053
I'm going to fuck off to the Dorchester.
Want to come or not?

22:50.054 --> 22:54.057
I'm sorry. I can't.
They're my parents.

22:54.058 --> 22:57.701
Look, stay. I'll grow some balls later, OK?
And a backbone.

22:57.702 --> 23:00.864
We can have backbone and
ball stew all Boxing Day.

23:00.865 --> 23:04.869
You can't just leave. What...
what am I going to tell them?

23:05.310 --> 23:08.432
Tell them I got sectioned or had
some violent masturbating to do.

23:08.433 --> 23:10.314
'Probably believe it.'

23:10.315 --> 23:13.318
(What do you say, Jeremy?
Shall we do it?)

23:13.319 --> 23:15.760
(It'd be so naughty.)

23:15.761 --> 23:19.644
(They'll be next door having turkey
and we'll be there, quietly humping.)

23:19.645 --> 23:22.207
But, Sarah, it's Christmas.

23:22.208 --> 23:24.530
So? What, are you religious
now, or something?

23:24.531 --> 23:26.412
Do you believe in Jesus?

23:26.413 --> 23:30.096
No, course I don't believe in Jesus,
but I do believe in Christmas.

23:30.097 --> 23:32.338
I'm a Christmasist.

23:32.339 --> 23:36.062
'Wow, I did it!
I resisted something for something else.

23:36.063 --> 23:37.904
'That was...something.'

23:37.905 --> 23:40.707
Hey, Mark, guess what!
I was just offered sex and I turned it down!

23:40.708 --> 23:42.028
Oh, well, congratulations.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.591
I did it for Father Christmas.

23:44.592 --> 23:48.596
'Look at him. He probably thinks
Father Christmas died for our sins.

23:48.637 --> 23:52.280
We heard the door. What happened?

23:52.281 --> 23:54.322
Dobby's...gone.

23:54.323 --> 23:58.326
Good riddance to bad rubbish.
You can do a lot better than that, Marko.

23:58.607 --> 24:02.490
Well, no, actually, because she's
great and thanks to you I'm a dick,

24:02.491 --> 24:04.853
so I was punching
well above my weight.

24:04.854 --> 24:07.576
Pass me some of that ham, will you?

24:07.577 --> 24:10.059
I think it's the only meat on
the table unlikely to kill me.

24:10.060 --> 24:14.023
Allow me. 'You want ham?
Well, you're going to get ham.

24:14.024 --> 24:15.504
'See how you like this ham.'

24:15.505 --> 24:18.468
SHREDDER WHIRRS

24:18.469 --> 24:20.670
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

24:20.671 --> 24:22.232
Thought you liked your ham shredded.

24:22.233 --> 24:25.555
Mark! Think what it's
doing to the mechanism.

24:25.556 --> 24:26.757
It's fine, Dad.

24:26.758 --> 24:30.761
Somebody stop him,
he's gone totally mad.

24:37.249 --> 24:41.252
Hello, Christmas movie.

24:41.453 --> 24:45.256
Right, very well.

24:45.257 --> 24:48.980
I'm making myself some cauliflower.

24:48.981 --> 24:52.985
'Uh-oh. Is Daddy coming to get me?

24:53.306 --> 24:56.068
'No, I've won! It's festive Festen!

24:56.069 --> 24:59.111
'Hakuna Matata!
I'm the new Lion King!'

24:59.112 --> 25:02.635
Right, Hans, pour my
mother a massive drink.

25:02.636 --> 25:04.357
Jeremy, turn on Ratatouille.

25:04.358 --> 25:06.439
Sarah, crack open the Pictionary.

25:06.440 --> 25:10.444
Merry ChristMark, everyone!
