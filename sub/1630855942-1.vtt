01:01.020 --> 01:05.107
Tomorrow we will bury
this one

01:05.524 --> 01:11.739
This Pipe Person.

01:15.451 --> 01:19.830
Our messenger to Wah-kon-tah.

01:20.873 --> 01:26.128
It is time to bury this Pipe
with dignity...

01:26.378 --> 01:30.549
... and put away its teachings.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.428
The children outside listening...

01:35.888 --> 01:38.891
...they will learn another language.

01:40.142 --> 01:43.562
They will be taught by white people.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.111
They will learn new ways...

01:51.654 --> 01:56.116
...and will not know our ways.

25:10.301 --> 25:13.137
Your name is Sun Hawk Woman.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.001
He's not that smart...

33:23.877 --> 33:25.921
...but he's handsome.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.924
He looks like a snake.

33:29.633 --> 33:32.928
No, he looks like Coyote.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.556
Those Blue Eyes.

33:37.307 --> 33:41.311
His brother is handsome, too.
I like the brother more.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.023
That red haired rat?

33:46.900 --> 33:51.989
Better than your possum
playing dead...

33:52.406 --> 33:54.575
...and lazing around the house.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.328
He's a possum around you...

33:58.537 --> 34:00.748
...he's like a rabbit to me.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.084
Be quiet...!

34:04.501 --> 34:06.420
...Coyote's watching.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.507
He wants our money.

34:12.009 --> 34:13.302
Of course he wants money...

34:13.719 --> 34:16.346
...but he wants to be settled.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.893
He's not restless.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.854
His Uncle has money...

34:23.979 --> 34:26.356
... it's not money he wants...

34:26.690 --> 34:28.066
... he loves you.

45:06.788 --> 45:08.581
Did you see the Owl?

45:10.417 --> 45:11.292
No.

45:15.797 --> 45:17.882
When you do...

45:18.800 --> 45:22.720
...it's a sign that we are dying.

45:24.139 --> 45:25.598
Because... of you.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.895
You all marry white men.

45:32.939 --> 45:35.817
Our blood is getting white.

45:39.654 --> 45:41.781
Where's Anna?

45:42.866 --> 45:44.993
I want Anna.

45:45.285 --> 45:46.786
I'm here.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.247
I don't want you.

45:49.831 --> 45:51.374
I want Anna.

46:33.708 --> 46:34.834
Are you laughing?

46:35.043 --> 46:36.544
Not yet... but...

46:44.719 --> 46:46.554
I brought blankets for Momma.

46:47.013 --> 46:48.806
You're drunk already?

46:49.015 --> 46:52.143
I'm still drunk from last
night, you woke me up.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.562
Don't let Momma see you this way.

46:54.562 --> 46:56.231
Don't fuss on me.

47:16.084 --> 47:18.086
Are you making threats?

47:42.360 --> 47:44.195
Older sister, calm down.

49:58.287 --> 49:59.997
You're...

50:00.915 --> 50:02.959
...wild.

50:19.308 --> 50:23.813
You're my best blessing.

50:25.773 --> 50:27.984
I'm your favorite?

50:29.235 --> 50:30.695
Yes...

50:32.071 --> 50:37.201
...stay with me here.

51:33.633 --> 51:35.259
Don't go out tonight.

01:44:04.155 --> 01:44:09.494
You are of the Elder Sky People.

01:44:10.703 --> 01:44:12.205
Little Anna...

01:44:12.205 --> 01:44:16.125
... your name is Wah hre lum pa.

01:45:54.515 --> 01:45:56.309
Little sister.

01:51:46.158 --> 01:51:48.202
But I was just at my sister's.

01:51:48.452 --> 01:51:50.955
You and the kids stay
in the house.

01:56:40.244 --> 01:56:44.498
I want to go now because I
will not be alive much longer.

01:59:45.429 --> 01:59:46.847
I'm afraid.

02:38:12.317 --> 02:38:15.570
Are you real?

02:42:10.263 --> 02:42:12.765
Where's my husband?

02:42:22.066 --> 02:42:23.109
Are you real?

02:42:32.910 --> 02:42:35.455
Where's my husband?

02:49:09.557 --> 02:49:12.059
I'll take you home now.
