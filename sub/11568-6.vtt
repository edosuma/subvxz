that again.

bunching up in there.

Let me hold it taut.

they don't have any edge.

Deezy, what the (BLEEP)
are you doing here?

01:29.490 --> 01:31.757
You know I don't like
when people just pop in, man.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.058
Why didn't you (BLEEP) call?

01:33.060 --> 01:34.626
I did, but it kept
going to voicemail.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.529
What? Oh damn,
my battery's dead.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.131
I bet I know
how that happened.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.833
I was watching a bunch
of videos, man.

01:40.835 --> 01:43.869
You seen the one where
this guy was blowing out
the birthday candles

01:43.871 --> 01:45.237
and then it blew his face off?

01:45.239 --> 01:47.106
No, no I didn't see that one.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.441
Oh, man, it's so
(BLEEP) funny, man.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.243
I'm gonna text it to you, man.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.846
Oh damn, my battery's dead.
How the (BLEEP)
did that happen?

01:53.848 --> 01:56.381
It's cool, it's cool,
don't worry about it.
Just text me it later.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.050
I do want to see it.
Sounds funny.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.252
Now, Mike.
I have something
I gotta talk to you about.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.221
What's going on Deezy?
You sound serious.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.956
Are you dropping me
as a client?

02:03.958 --> 02:06.325
You better rearrange
your thoughts mother (BLEEP).

02:06.327 --> 02:09.161
I'll drop you as my agent.
You're a shitty agent.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.929
I'm gonna kick
your ass right now.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.532
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mike, Mike. Breathe, breathe.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.901
-I'm not dropping you
as a client.
-Okay, what's up?

02:15.903 --> 02:19.471
Um, I was just wondering
how you would feel
about an internship program.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.473
Mmm. I might really like that.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.342
Depends on where
the internship is.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.078
But I could definitely go for
a change of career.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.881
I mean, man, solving mysteries
is stressing me out.

02:28.883 --> 02:31.617
It's like, "What... What am I
doing with my life?"

02:31.619 --> 02:34.653
You know, "Who the (BLEEP)
are these people on my team?"

02:34.655 --> 02:36.488
I don't really like
any of these people.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.891
We don't have
anything in common.
Like interests.

02:38.893 --> 02:41.493
Like, I'm into video games
and (BLEEP) you know?

02:41.495 --> 02:45.831
Like, if you got me
into an internship
with Xbox or some shit,

02:45.833 --> 02:46.965
that could be good.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.800
Just play video games all day,

02:48.802 --> 02:50.702
and just get paid for it.
I like that.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.071
No, no, no, no, Mike.
You wouldn't be the intern.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.340
I'm talking about someone
being an intern for you.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.209
Okay, that sounds good.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.278
Viennetta! He says,
"Sounds good"!

03:04.250 --> 03:06.251
-Who the (BLEEP) is that?
-That's my niece.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.920
She just graduated
from community college,

03:07.922 --> 03:09.955
and she's out here
figuring out
what she wants to do.

03:09.957 --> 03:13.125
Nice to meet you.
My name's Viennetta,
like the ice cream.

03:13.127 --> 03:17.062
My name is Mike Tyson
like the heavyweight champion
of the world, Mike Tyson.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.898
Um, Dad. Sorry to interrupt
but we have a new mystery.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.202
Ooh, perfect timing.
Now remember
what I told you, Viennetta.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.003
Keep your eyes and ears open.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.439
Keep your head on a swivel,
but keep your feet
on the ground.

03:27.441 --> 03:30.609
Open your heart and your mind,
and there's nowhere you
imagination can't take you.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.912
Okay, I gotta go.
The tint is bubbling on
my (BLEEP) rear windshield.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.414
Gotta get that smoothed out.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.083
You are what you drive.
Remember that, Viennetta.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.351
(ENGINE STARTING)

03:43.690 --> 03:45.691
So, Viennetta,

03:45.693 --> 03:47.826
have you always been
interested in mysteries?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.828
Oh, I'm not interested
in mysteries.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.698
But my uncle said
this would be
a good back-up plan.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.534
PIGEON: Well, your uncle
is a very smart fellow.

03:55.536 --> 03:58.303
To get you
an internship at a thing
that is not a company,

03:58.305 --> 04:01.640
where no one makes any money,
but every once in a while
you might get killed

04:01.642 --> 04:05.911
due to the gross incompetence
of your completely
unqualified colleagues.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.779

-(MARQUESS GRUMBLING)

04:07.781 --> 04:10.716
Are you done?
Because we can wait
until you're done.

04:10.718 --> 04:11.783
No, I'm done.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.152
Great. Now, Viennetta...

04:14.154 --> 04:15.254
Oh, one more thing.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.022
-What?
-Jesus, calm down.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.959
No. You always do this,
Pigeon. You always do this.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.961
Just say it.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.764
Well, now I've forgotten
what I was gonna say
because you shrieked at me.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.767
You are driving me
(BLEEP) insane.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.936
(BLEEP) insane.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.137
I'm so sorry, Viennetta.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.538
(LAUGHING)

04:33.540 --> 04:36.041
So, um, what career
are you interested in?

04:36.043 --> 04:39.244
Well, my mom and my pastor
always told me
I should be a model.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.046
So, that's what I really
came out here to do.

04:41.048 --> 04:45.751
Ooh. Ah. You know,
I did some modeling
back in my day.

04:45.753 --> 04:49.021
Yeah. I was a life model
for a few of my
painter friends.

04:49.023 --> 04:53.358
Manet, Courbet, Rousseau.
Ah, I did 'em all.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.229
Yeah, I'm sure you did,
you dead queen.

04:57.231 --> 05:00.532
Oh, you know what?
You know what?

05:00.534 --> 05:03.001
Anyways. Viennetta,
have you had any luck yet?

05:03.003 --> 05:06.438
Not yet. My uncle
took me to a bunch
of modeling agencies,

05:06.440 --> 05:09.541
except it turns out
all the modeling agencies
in Las Vegas

05:09.543 --> 05:11.543
are actually escort agencies.

05:11.545 --> 05:14.413
So, I didn't really get
any good photos
for my portfolio.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.281
PIGEON: Oh,
I wouldn't say that.

05:16.283 --> 05:19.651
Hey, this one of you holding
this older man's penis
is all right.

05:19.653 --> 05:23.755
Maybe not for high fashion,
but for like, you know,
medium to lower fashion.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.524
It seems okay.

05:27.593 --> 05:29.361
I feel like we're
losing the crowd here.

-Monday.

if I never found out
how you got out of that mine.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.955
Now, let's have a look at
your resume, shall we?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.157
Graduated from
St. Louis Community College.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.561
Interned at Mike Tyson
Mysteries, impressive.

10:29.563 --> 10:31.162
And do you have a portfolio?

10:31.164 --> 10:32.897
Uh-huh. Yes, ma'am.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.300
Hmm.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.636
And who is this older man?

10:37.638 --> 10:39.704
Oh, I didn't get his name.

10:39.706 --> 10:42.040
Well, I think I've seen
all I need to see.

10:42.042 --> 10:46.811
Lauren, will you let Andre
know we've just found
our September cover model?
