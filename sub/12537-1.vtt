(Groan)

(Metallic rattling)

01:48.155 --> 01:50.256
All right, Grindenko,
we're good.

(Door closes)

02:24.525 --> 02:26.192
(Low conversation)

02:29.396 --> 02:30.863
- Boys.
- Hey.

02:30.898 --> 02:32.598
What's up?

02:41.975 --> 02:45.545
- Are you okay?
- He's a real scumbag.

02:45.579 --> 02:48.147
- What, he hit on you?
- Would it matter if he did?

02:49.316 --> 02:52.184
He had a couple of girls chained
up down there.

02:52.219 --> 02:55.187
Well... as long as
his business is good.

02:56.523 --> 03:00.393
He's good for it. You can't tell 'em
from the real thing.

03:01.328 --> 03:04.230
Headaches and highs.
40 bucks a pop.

03:05.032 --> 03:07.600
You're looking at
a 60% mark-up. Easy money.

03:07.634 --> 03:09.101
There's no such thing.

03:09.136 --> 03:11.237
Considering I'm doing
all the work.

03:13.373 --> 03:15.174
You're making an introduction.

03:15.943 --> 03:17.577
- I want 15%.
- Ten.

03:17.611 --> 03:19.745
- This is my deal.
- Don't get above yourself.

03:19.780 --> 03:23.549
- I can take it elsewhere.
- 12. Don't push it.

03:24.284 --> 03:25.918
You're gonna be there, right? Tomorrow?

03:25.953 --> 03:28.621
- I'll get you the money.
- He only wants to deal with you.

03:28.655 --> 03:30.690
I'll get you the money.

03:34.494 --> 03:36.495
You wanna grab a bite to eat, Jack?

03:37.397 --> 03:40.032
- Now?
- Hm.

03:41.201 --> 03:42.535
You wanna take me on a date, Jimmy?

03:42.569 --> 03:44.270
No.

03:44.871 --> 03:46.539
Well, maybe.

03:47.507 --> 03:49.208
A little.

03:49.242 --> 03:51.477
A little of a date?
Either it is or it isn't.

03:51.511 --> 03:53.312
- Don't laugh at me.
- I'm not.

03:53.347 --> 03:55.081
We grab a bite to eat, Jackie.

03:55.115 --> 03:57.416
Talk business.

03:57.451 --> 03:59.552
Two birds, one stone.

03:59.586 --> 04:01.153
Always with the practicalities.

04:01.188 --> 04:02.888
Yeah, well...

04:03.590 --> 04:06.125
you know me.

04:06.159 --> 04:07.860
Another time.

05:48.829 --> 05:50.663
Hey, baby.

05:51.898 --> 05:53.632
- Evie!
(BOY) - Go away!

05:55.769 --> 05:57.436
Leave them alone!

06:05.712 --> 06:08.748
Go away! Leave them alone!

06:10.283 --> 06:11.951
Go away!

06:12.719 --> 06:14.386
Hey... Sammy.

06:15.055 --> 06:17.056
It's me.

06:18.191 --> 06:20.693
You were having a bad dream.
It's okay.

06:20.727 --> 06:22.428
It's okay, sweetie.

06:31.271 --> 06:34.240
Come on, let's get you changed.

06:37.110 --> 06:38.778
Oh.

06:39.513 --> 06:41.180
Come on, baby.

06:52.025 --> 06:53.692
Grace?

06:54.761 --> 06:57.096
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

06:57.731 --> 06:59.265
Are you okay?

06:59.966 --> 07:02.001
I just needed to come home.

07:02.035 --> 07:04.336
- Hm.
- He wet the bed again.

07:05.305 --> 07:06.972
(Groans)

07:08.441 --> 07:11.243
- Okay. Want me to change it?
- I already did it.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.347
- Oh.
- That's good.

07:58.992 --> 08:01.126
- So where's Jimmy?
- He sent me.

08:01.161 --> 08:03.429
- He's supposed to be here.
- Well, he sent me.

08:03.463 --> 08:05.097
- (Police siren)
- Fuck!

08:07.434 --> 08:09.001
(Cries out)

08:09.936 --> 08:11.604
(Tires screech)

08:13.273 --> 08:15.274
Stop, shithead!

08:17.677 --> 08:19.211
No!

08:19.246 --> 08:20.946
Aaargh!

08:21.481 --> 08:23.182
- Freeze!
- I got her. It's okay.

08:23.216 --> 08:25.017
- I got it.
- Freeze!

08:25.352 --> 08:26.919
You have the right
to remain silent.

08:26.953 --> 08:28.654
Get the fuck off me!

08:29.489 --> 08:31.290
(Grunts) Aaargh.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.192
It's okay. I got her.

08:33.226 --> 08:34.927
What the fuck you doing here?

08:35.395 --> 08:38.163
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You never answer your fucking phone!

08:38.198 --> 08:41.200
It went off the reservation.
We're pulling you out.

08:41.234 --> 08:42.768
I don't have anything.

08:42.802 --> 08:44.637
I don't fucking have anything!

08:45.538 --> 08:46.872
It's Sam.

08:50.577 --> 08:52.578
Is he okay?

08:59.619 --> 09:00.853
(Gunshots)

09:00.887 --> 09:02.955
He's okay, right?

09:02.989 --> 09:04.690
(Tires screech)

09:06.760 --> 09:08.427
Tell me he's okay.

09:09.996 --> 09:11.664
Tell me he's okay!

09:20.332 --> 09:24.089
_

09:30.150 --> 09:32.051
Does this mean I get invited to
the barbecues?

09:32.085 --> 09:33.819
Sure.
They'll be a lot of them.

09:33.853 --> 09:35.554
(Laughter)

09:36.056 --> 09:37.890
We're very pleased
with the arrangement.

09:37.924 --> 09:40.059
- As are we.
- Jimmy, Tony.

09:40.093 --> 09:41.794
Looking forward to it, Ted.

09:44.497 --> 09:46.165
(Laughs)

09:55.875 --> 09:57.710
(Gulls cry)

10:05.285 --> 10:06.552
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Joe.

10:08.054 --> 10:09.221
(Moaning)

10:09.255 --> 10:11.290
- Hand off your cock.
- (Laughter)

10:14.794 --> 10:16.762
- Hey, boss.
- Boys.

10:24.971 --> 10:27.973
- We pulled it off.
- (Both laugh)

10:29.776 --> 10:31.443
You pulled it off, Jimmy.

10:32.712 --> 10:35.481
This time tomorrow
you'll be partner in a bank.

10:35.515 --> 10:37.216
(Laughs)

10:41.454 --> 10:42.855
Ahhh.

10:42.889 --> 10:45.057
I wish my old man was around
to see this.

10:47.594 --> 10:49.228
When you gonna tell the crew?

10:49.262 --> 10:51.163
They're not gonna be
a part of it.

10:53.666 --> 10:55.534
They're not gonna like it,
Jimmy.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.737
Once it comes through...

11:00.640 --> 11:02.741
I'm leaving
all this shit behind.

11:35.642 --> 11:37.309
(Engine starts)

12:07.040 --> 12:08.707
(Talking softly to herself)

12:10.243 --> 12:14.613
That's two weeks...
That's two weeks before.

12:21.821 --> 12:24.590
_ (Exhales heavily)

12:37.270 --> 12:38.937
(Police radios)

12:42.942 --> 12:45.878
Single shot, back of
the head. Very efficient.

12:46.446 --> 12:49.448
- We have an ID?
- No, ma'am. Not yet.

12:49.482 --> 12:51.984
Lieutenant,
I hear you could use a hand.

12:53.286 --> 12:54.653
Have we lifted these prints?

12:54.687 --> 12:57.055
- Uh-huh.
- Come on, you need me.

12:58.525 --> 13:01.393
Expenses fraud.
Concealing evidence.

13:01.427 --> 13:03.162
Allegations.

13:03.196 --> 13:05.731
Disciplinary Board didn't hold
up a single one.

13:05.765 --> 13:07.466
You're a liability, Wilson.

13:09.202 --> 13:11.203
Tony Aldon.

13:13.173 --> 13:15.040
The accountant of Jimmy Laszlo.

13:15.942 --> 13:18.210
Technically speaking,
not part of his crew,

13:18.244 --> 13:20.812
which is why you got
no surveillance on him.

13:20.847 --> 13:23.415
Which is why you haven't
ID'd him. Am I right?

13:37.096 --> 13:38.764
(Low conversation)

14:05.158 --> 14:06.925
I know we're all shaken up.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.895
But we're gonna deal with this.
We've pulled through worse.

14:09.929 --> 14:12.030
Why Tony? He was
a fucking accountant.

14:12.065 --> 14:13.999
- I don't know.
- Poor bastard.

14:14.033 --> 14:15.601
The guy never stood a chance.

14:15.635 --> 14:17.569
We're gonna find out
who did this.

14:17.604 --> 14:19.004
What have we got?

14:19.038 --> 14:21.940
Karabas shut down two more
chop shops on the East Side.

14:21.975 --> 14:23.842
But...
he's got his hands full.

14:23.876 --> 14:26.545
- Doesn't sound like him.
- It's the Clay Street boys.

14:26.579 --> 14:28.780
Fucking Chinks have the city,
and want the docks!

14:28.815 --> 14:30.782
Put that fucking thing out!
Charlie?

14:30.817 --> 14:32.584
Alec's got a point.

14:32.619 --> 14:36.088
Clay Street did hit that gook dope
house over on Regent last week.

14:36.122 --> 14:38.323
I don't buy it.
Chinks know the cost of war.

14:38.358 --> 14:40.959
- Doesn't explain why Tony.
- Easy way to make a statement.

14:40.994 --> 14:42.661
Look, I say we meet fire with fire.

14:42.695 --> 14:45.230
I want something solid before we
start anything.

14:45.265 --> 14:48.567
Any escalation of this is gonna
be bad for business.

14:48.601 --> 14:51.136
God knows,
that's in the tank already.

15:17.547 --> 15:19.691
_

15:21.501 --> 15:23.335
(Bleeping)

15:23.369 --> 15:25.337
I thought
you were still on leave.

15:27.807 --> 15:30.375
- What are you doing?
- Finding my son's killer.

15:30.410 --> 15:32.244
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is that your job?

15:34.247 --> 15:36.682
Where is everyone?

15:36.716 --> 15:38.717
I'm glad to see the case
is still a priority.

15:38.751 --> 15:40.552
Come on, it's not like that.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.255
Remember Jerry Baker?

15:43.289 --> 15:46.258
Carved up his brother Christmas
Day, about ten years back?

15:46.292 --> 15:48.193
Attacked me in court, remember?

15:48.227 --> 15:50.962
He was out on parole two weeks
before Sam was shot.

15:50.997 --> 15:54.933
Baker was on community service
at Alameda County Juvy home.

15:54.967 --> 15:57.436
Staff have him working
the day Sam was shot.

15:57.470 --> 16:00.405
You second-guessing me
the whole time doesn't help.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.275
Come on, Mitch, we both know
you haven't broken a case in years.

16:03.309 --> 16:05.644
Stop torturing yourself.

16:06.546 --> 16:08.180
What if Sam wasn't the target?

16:08.214 --> 16:10.382
What if he was actually caught
in the crossfire?

16:10.416 --> 16:12.984
A stray bullet. An accident.

16:13.019 --> 16:16.221
Just a tragic, senseless accident.
It happens all the time.

16:16.255 --> 16:18.490
What if you're just shitty
at your job?

16:19.258 --> 16:21.960
You don't find me the car.
You don't find the gun.

16:22.829 --> 16:25.230
Who was the target, then?
Those young gang-bangers?

16:25.264 --> 16:26.965
That your theory?

16:33.306 --> 16:34.973
You didn't get this from me.

16:50.022 --> 16:51.690
(Gasps)

17:02.201 --> 17:03.869
(Car horns)

17:18.951 --> 17:20.618
Who's that?

17:25.023 --> 17:27.893
What are you... Are you crazy
marching in here?

17:27.926 --> 17:29.795
Open it.

17:31.364 --> 17:33.765
The bullets they took
out of Tony Aldon.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.167
Home-made.

17:35.201 --> 17:37.035
Same blend...

17:37.069 --> 17:39.237
Same blend of metals
they took out of my son.

17:39.272 --> 17:40.305
Look...

17:40.339 --> 17:43.542
This is the first lead
in Sam's case. I want in.

17:44.444 --> 17:46.378
It will take another detective a
year

17:46.412 --> 17:49.147
to catch up on what I know about
Jimmy's operation.

17:49.182 --> 17:51.082
You are done in Oakland, Grace.

17:51.117 --> 17:54.019
Your loan-out's finished.
Now go back to San Jose.

17:55.021 --> 17:57.756
You think Jimmy's not gonna find
Tony's killer before we do?

17:57.790 --> 18:00.759
- The bullets aren't a match.
- But they're home-made.

18:00.793 --> 18:02.494
It's a start.

18:03.162 --> 18:05.664
My legend's intact.
Jimmy still trusts me.

18:05.698 --> 18:07.599
Even if you knew
that was true...

18:08.701 --> 18:10.335
which you don't...

18:10.369 --> 18:12.737
there is no way I am bringing
you in on this thing.

18:13.506 --> 18:15.874
Too damn close to it.
Now go home.

18:16.776 --> 18:18.810
- Finish your leave.
- Come on, Lieutenant,

18:18.845 --> 18:22.080
- you know I'm the only...
- I said, go home.

19:48.467 --> 19:51.970
Jackie? Where the fuck
have you been?

19:59.679 --> 20:01.479
Four months--
that's all you gotta say to me?

20:01.514 --> 20:03.982
- You cost me money.
- I cost you?

20:04.784 --> 20:07.852
That was my deal. It didn't cost
you a fucking thing.

20:08.654 --> 20:12.190
I lost out and I got felt up by
some slimy fucking cop,

20:12.224 --> 20:13.825
with hairy hands
and a hard-on.

20:14.694 --> 20:17.062
Yeah, and what happened
to you? Nothing.

20:17.096 --> 20:19.264
You sat here drinking
your fucking wine,

20:19.298 --> 20:20.966
looking down on the world.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.568
- You didn't even show up.
- Smart move as it turns out.

20:23.603 --> 20:25.971
Yeah. God forbid
you should sweat a little.

20:26.005 --> 20:28.740
Four months.
Where did you go?

20:30.576 --> 20:32.777
Union had me down
in Long Beach.

20:32.812 --> 20:34.512
The yards were backed up.

20:35.247 --> 20:36.748
Suited me just fine, lay low.

20:36.782 --> 20:39.050
What, now you're back?
Waltz right in here.

20:40.019 --> 20:41.319
The way I see it you owe me.

20:41.354 --> 20:43.455
The fucking balls on you!

20:43.489 --> 20:45.690
You brought the fucking cops
to my door.

20:45.725 --> 20:46.825
What?

20:46.826 --> 20:48.826
Well, they were watching somebody
and sure shit it wasn't me!

20:48.995 --> 20:52.597
What you talking about? They're watching everyone.
How do I know it wasn't you?

20:52.632 --> 20:54.032
Jimmy, if I was the leak,

20:54.066 --> 20:57.035
they wouldn't have thrown in the
bust before the deal went down.

20:57.069 --> 20:59.504
I'm fucking good
at what I do. I'm careful.

21:00.473 --> 21:03.475
Can you say that about every
last man in your operation?

21:03.509 --> 21:05.210
Every last fucking man?

21:06.579 --> 21:09.414
Look... I'm just here
to make money.

21:10.416 --> 21:13.518
Four months out of the action
I'm guessing you can use it.

21:13.653 --> 21:14.986
And you can't?

21:15.021 --> 21:16.721
Oh, I heard about Tony.

21:18.891 --> 21:20.892
People are gonna be
looking at you.

21:21.827 --> 21:24.496
I figure you set up a couple of
new deals, come back strong.

21:24.530 --> 21:26.264
Oh, you're here to
give me advice.

21:26.298 --> 21:28.933
Now, is that free
or you charging me 15%?

21:28.968 --> 21:31.603
I can still put action
your way. You know that.

21:31.837 --> 21:34.439
Grindenko was just the first.
Tip of the fucking iceberg.

21:34.473 --> 21:36.441
You think Grindenko
was the leak?

21:36.475 --> 21:40.145
I have another source.
Operates out of Shanghai.

21:40.913 --> 21:43.481
Every day his factory's knocking
out thousands of pills

21:43.516 --> 21:46.151
housewives up and down
this country are dying for.

21:46.485 --> 21:49.654
You have the routes.
I can get you the product.

21:50.556 --> 21:54.192
Last year sales of counterfeit
meds were worth 75 billion.

21:54.226 --> 21:55.927
75!

21:57.196 --> 21:58.897
You tell me
you don't want a piece,

21:58.931 --> 22:01.633
I will turn around
and walk right out that door.

22:03.402 --> 22:04.903
(Exhales)

22:12.878 --> 22:14.546
(Scraping)

22:15.915 --> 22:17.749
(Door closes)

22:23.322 --> 22:25.657
I thought you were gonna be home
for dinner.

22:27.359 --> 22:29.027
So where you been?

22:30.696 --> 22:32.330
(Clears throat)

22:32.364 --> 22:33.898
What?

22:33.933 --> 22:36.134
Hernandez called
and I went to see her.

22:36.168 --> 22:38.036
(He sighs)

22:39.638 --> 22:41.673
What am I supposed to do?
She's my boss.

22:41.707 --> 22:44.876
Was... your boss.
Not any more. Right?

22:47.480 --> 22:49.147
(She sighs)

22:50.783 --> 22:52.450
You said yes.

22:53.252 --> 22:56.087
Come on, Grace, what about
your promise to Evie?

22:56.121 --> 22:58.856
- You said you were done.
- I am! I will be.

23:00.359 --> 23:02.160
They need me, Tommy.
And it's my job.

23:02.194 --> 23:04.595
It's not a job,
it's an addiction.

23:04.630 --> 23:06.731
That's bullshit!

23:06.765 --> 23:08.499
(Slams table)
After everything...

23:08.534 --> 23:11.469
"It's my job.
It's my fucking job."

23:12.871 --> 23:16.374
Have you ever stopped to think, maybe
if you'd been around a little more...

23:16.408 --> 23:18.409
- That's enough.
- Don't you dare...

23:18.444 --> 23:20.912
Don't you dare put that on me
you fucking coward!

23:20.946 --> 23:22.647
I said, that's enough!

23:22.681 --> 23:24.816
You... in your room.

23:24.850 --> 23:26.718
Right now! Go!

23:31.957 --> 23:33.624
- (Knock at door)
- No!

23:34.727 --> 23:37.362
- I said no.
- Evie, I'm sorry.

23:38.263 --> 23:40.465
Huh. You're going back,
aren't you?

23:41.300 --> 23:43.434
The great disappearing act that
is my mother.

23:45.004 --> 23:46.938
It won't be for long,
I promise.

23:47.439 --> 23:50.241
Oh, good. Another promise.

23:52.044 --> 23:54.045
I'll add it to my collection.

24:00.486 --> 24:02.153
(Gulls cry)

24:15.901 --> 24:18.002
- Is this a good idea?
- Well, you said he gave you up.

24:18.604 --> 24:20.972
Is Grindenko the rat?
I want to know.

24:21.306 --> 24:22.874
So you're gonna go up
and ask him?

24:22.908 --> 24:25.543
No, you are. You brought him in,
you deal with it.

24:26.678 --> 24:28.346
Jimmy, down!

24:31.617 --> 24:33.251
Oh, fuck!

24:33.285 --> 24:34.952
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!

24:34.987 --> 24:36.054
Jackie.

24:37.556 --> 24:39.624
(JIMMY) I'm fine, I'm fine.

24:40.359 --> 24:42.026
No, it's okay.

24:43.862 --> 24:45.696
You tell them, I'm fine!

24:47.032 --> 24:48.666
Jesus.

24:48.700 --> 24:51.102
I can't believe
I didn't see it coming.

24:52.004 --> 24:55.606
I'm the one bleeding and you're
feeling sorry for yourself?

25:00.846 --> 25:03.548
People can't know
how this went down.

25:03.582 --> 25:05.149
Jimmy,
someone took a pop at you.

25:05.184 --> 25:07.085
And they'll answer for it.

25:07.786 --> 25:10.021
Yeah, okay. Not a word.

25:11.223 --> 25:12.890
Oh... fuck!

25:13.192 --> 25:14.992
You're done.

25:19.731 --> 25:21.399
Lucky charm.

25:30.342 --> 25:32.009
Oh, fuck.

25:34.346 --> 25:37.648
Jesus. You wanna tell me
what I'm doing here?

25:38.283 --> 25:40.084
Trying to salvage your career.

25:41.787 --> 25:43.754
You can either report me,

25:43.789 --> 25:46.124
or put that through Ballistics
and cover for me.

25:47.159 --> 25:48.826
Why would I wanna do that?

25:49.862 --> 25:51.863
Cos you might finally
break a case.

25:52.698 --> 25:54.699
Wouldn't that be a novelty?

25:56.902 --> 25:58.736
(Scoffs)

26:00.639 --> 26:02.640
(Car horn)

26:10.849 --> 26:12.350
You didn't get a look at him?

26:12.384 --> 26:14.085
- No.
- (Cellphone rings)

26:16.088 --> 26:17.755
(Terminates call)

26:17.789 --> 26:19.891
You can't keep ignoring it, Dad.

26:19.925 --> 26:21.292
The boys wanna talk to you.

26:21.326 --> 26:23.661
Tell 'em to sit tight,
I'll handle this.

26:23.695 --> 26:25.396
(Exhales)

26:26.665 --> 26:29.100
- What?
- They're worried about you.

26:29.134 --> 26:31.569
First Tony, now this,
it looks bad.

26:32.905 --> 26:36.073
Jeez... it's a fucking siege.

26:36.108 --> 26:39.877
For fuck's sake, read a book.
Learn what a siege is!

26:41.446 --> 26:43.381
They're nervous, Dad.

26:43.415 --> 26:46.684
You haven't had your eye on the ball.
Business has fallen off the cliff.

26:46.718 --> 26:48.486
Fucking recession,
it's hit everyone.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.155
You've been preoccupied, and
think people aren't noticing.

26:51.190 --> 26:55.092
- You're not...
- You're not-- what?

26:58.096 --> 26:59.764
The man I once was?

27:00.699 --> 27:03.401
You tell my loyal band
of merry fucking men,

27:03.435 --> 27:05.937
I will handle this!

27:09.041 --> 27:10.708
You understand?

27:12.878 --> 27:14.545
Yeah, I got it.

27:16.415 --> 27:18.249
I got it.

27:25.224 --> 27:26.891
Come here.

27:29.261 --> 27:30.795
Look, I was just worried about you.

27:30.829 --> 27:32.530
I know.

27:39.571 --> 27:41.205
It's all right.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.940
(Cellphone rings)

27:50.515 --> 27:52.383
Max.

27:52.918 --> 27:55.853
No, I'm fine. Nothing to worry
about, nothing at all.

27:56.955 --> 27:59.357
Yeah, you can stay out of trouble
until you get out.

28:01.893 --> 28:03.794
We'll see you very soon, okay?

28:04.963 --> 28:07.098
Okay. I love you.

28:07.132 --> 28:10.067
Here... talk to your brother.

28:13.905 --> 28:15.573
Yeah, baby face.

28:16.642 --> 28:19.443
No, no, he's fine.
There's not a scratch on him.

28:21.947 --> 28:23.914
Yeah, well, nine lives, huh?

28:28.053 --> 28:30.621
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:33.592 --> 28:35.860
- Hoi sin.
- Hm?

28:35.894 --> 28:37.561
It's a Chinese dipping sauce.

28:37.596 --> 28:39.764
Yeah, I had an ex
who was Chinese.

28:39.798 --> 28:42.300
Exotic dancer,
five foot nothing in heels.

28:43.769 --> 28:47.271
We pulled hoi sin from the footprints
next to Tony Aldon's body.

28:49.875 --> 28:52.009
There was a shooting
down by the docks.

28:52.044 --> 28:54.679
Someone got clipped.
We found blood.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.947
It's one of ours.

28:59.217 --> 29:01.319
Grace Travis, San Jose PD.

29:04.890 --> 29:07.858
Yeah, I'm gonna need to keep
hold of this. Thanks.

29:23.175 --> 29:24.442
What?

29:24.476 --> 29:26.544
I'm looking for Grace.
Is she home?

29:26.578 --> 29:29.213
No. I thought
she was back with you.

29:29.948 --> 29:32.717
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

29:33.585 --> 29:35.219
My mistake.

29:36.154 --> 29:38.689
- It's nice talking to you.
- Right.

29:56.975 --> 29:58.476
Ow!

29:58.510 --> 30:00.544
What the fuck you do that for?

30:00.579 --> 30:02.279
Fucking idiot.

30:08.186 --> 30:10.154
You're back in with Jimmy,
aren't you?

30:10.188 --> 30:11.856
(Running water)

30:11.890 --> 30:14.358
You really thought
no-one would find out?

30:15.994 --> 30:18.396
Interfering in a homicide
investigation,

30:18.430 --> 30:21.265
misuse of police property.
I could have you arrested.

30:21.299 --> 30:24.034
- What do you want?
- Results.

30:24.069 --> 30:26.537
I need to get on
Hernandez's good side.

30:26.571 --> 30:28.539
Well, here's an idea.
Do some work.

30:28.573 --> 30:30.541
Why, when you're gonna
do it for me.

30:32.077 --> 30:33.744
You give me
what you get on Jimmy

30:33.779 --> 30:38.082
and I'll turn a blind eye to whatever
vigilante sideshow you're running here.

30:38.517 --> 30:40.384
Let's start with the hit
on Jimmy.

30:42.521 --> 30:44.188
I know you were there.

30:46.591 --> 30:49.360
Fine. Grace Travis,
I am arresting you...

30:49.394 --> 30:51.095
Fuck off!

30:56.468 --> 31:00.070
A gray Sedan.
That's the plate.

31:02.207 --> 31:04.642
And Jimmy has no idea
who's behind it.

31:06.511 --> 31:08.245
Get your fucking hands off me.

31:09.614 --> 31:11.949
You need me, darling.
You remember that.

31:13.218 --> 31:14.852
Okay?

31:14.886 --> 31:19.056
Oh, and er... I'd go see that
charming husband of yours...

31:20.091 --> 31:22.560
He really had no idea
you were moonlighting.

31:25.797 --> 31:28.165
(Door opens and closes)

31:42.013 --> 31:43.681
Aargh...

31:46.251 --> 31:47.918
What is it?

31:49.554 --> 31:51.589
Nothing. A sprain.

31:53.959 --> 31:55.726
Okay, let's have a look.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.428
I'm fine.

32:02.234 --> 32:05.669
I'm sorry that you had to find out
from that prick Wilson.

32:07.672 --> 32:11.108
What does it matter who I find
out from? It's just another lie.

32:11.142 --> 32:12.843
They had a lead.

32:14.079 --> 32:17.414
I tried to get in on it,
but they shut me out.

32:18.783 --> 32:20.985
But you followed it anyway,
didn't you?

32:22.287 --> 32:23.954
(Sighs)

32:24.723 --> 32:26.590
They're burying the case, Tommy.

32:28.326 --> 32:31.028
It's become an embarrassment
to the department.

32:31.062 --> 32:32.796
You should have told me, Grace.

32:32.831 --> 32:34.732
I didn't wanna get
your hopes up.

32:35.567 --> 32:37.234
Until I had something.

32:38.336 --> 32:40.004
And do you?

32:40.906 --> 32:43.140
No. Nothing concrete.

32:46.444 --> 32:48.612
But you're gonna continue,
aren't you?

32:48.647 --> 32:50.347
I don't have a choice.

32:52.384 --> 32:53.918
You think that
if you find them...

32:53.952 --> 32:56.420
When I find them.

32:57.122 --> 33:00.824
You really think it's gonna make
you feel any less guilty?

33:04.329 --> 33:05.996
Fuck you, Tommy.

33:10.936 --> 33:13.003
I got work to do.

33:27.018 --> 33:28.652
You're late.

33:28.687 --> 33:30.721
(Train bell clanking)

33:32.791 --> 33:35.726
Hey, I'm sticking my neck out
for you here.

33:36.561 --> 33:38.896
You getting a taste
for real police work, Mitch?

33:39.197 --> 33:40.831
Where'd that bullet come from?

33:42.968 --> 33:44.635
Ah, Christ.

33:46.304 --> 33:47.805
It was meant for Jimmy Laszlo.

33:47.839 --> 33:49.673
Oh, you're back in
with him now?

33:50.442 --> 33:52.176
How'd you persuade Hernandez?

33:53.645 --> 33:57.247
She doesn't know?
Christ, Travis.

33:57.282 --> 33:58.983
Have you lost your mind?

33:59.584 --> 34:01.251
I need your help, Mitch.

34:02.621 --> 34:04.622
I don't have anyone else.

34:08.493 --> 34:10.360
All right, there you go.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.068
- The home-made bullet.
- Hm.

34:21.106 --> 34:24.975
Just like the one they pulled out of Tony Aldon.
And the one that killed Sam.

34:25.010 --> 34:27.645
All three different
blended metals.

34:28.713 --> 34:31.849
Whoever's making them could be
mixing it up, cover their tracks.

34:31.882 --> 34:35.185
Maybe there's no connection at all.
Maybe you're just reaching.

34:36.187 --> 34:38.155
Maybe.

34:38.922 --> 34:40.591
But what else have I got?

34:45.230 --> 34:46.797
That drive-by down by the docks?

34:47.565 --> 34:50.067
Someone was taking a shot
at Jimmy Laszlo.

34:50.101 --> 34:52.101
We should get them
target practice.

34:52.137 --> 34:55.539
Suspect vehicle was a gray
Sedan. That's the plate.

34:59.344 --> 35:00.811
What did you do to your face?

35:00.845 --> 35:02.546
Oh, you should see
the other girl.

35:02.580 --> 35:05.449
- How'd you get this?
- A CI I've been working.

35:06.284 --> 35:08.385
Car's registered
to a Michael Grant.

35:08.420 --> 35:11.288
The name's a non-starter,
but the address,

35:11.322 --> 35:13.457
some dope house on 28th Street.

35:13.491 --> 35:15.526
DEA raided it two weeks ago.

35:17.395 --> 35:21.865
This is er... good work.

35:23.234 --> 35:25.502
Thanks, I appreciate that,
Lieutenant.

35:40.251 --> 35:42.920
Where are we going?
My fucking shoulder's hurting.

35:42.954 --> 35:44.421
Stop moaning, Jacks.

35:44.456 --> 35:47.057
Oh. I'm sorry.
Did I take a bullet for you?

35:47.092 --> 35:49.493
You're dangerous to be around.

35:49.961 --> 35:51.628
Funny.

36:12.484 --> 36:15.519
- What are we doing here?
- Keep going, it's not far.

36:20.058 --> 36:21.725
You never wanted kids, Jack?

36:23.394 --> 36:27.331
Nah... I don't think I'd make
a very good mother.

36:27.365 --> 36:29.233
Oh, I doubt that.

36:37.575 --> 36:40.377
- Here we are.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

36:40.411 --> 36:42.112
(Muffled cries)

36:45.216 --> 36:47.050
(Whirring)

36:47.085 --> 36:48.786
(Muffled cries)

36:50.288 --> 36:51.788
- You do it.
- Jimmy. Listen.

36:51.823 --> 36:54.458
- He gave you up, Jacks.
- No, I didn't say that.

36:54.926 --> 36:56.059
We don't know that.

36:56.094 --> 36:59.196
It was either him, me or you.
So who was it?

37:00.331 --> 37:03.667
You want in on my business, this
is my business, Jacks.

37:07.005 --> 37:08.672
(Muffled whimpering)

37:45.176 --> 37:48.145
You ever see Death
Of A Salesman, Jacks?

37:50.114 --> 37:51.248
Er...

37:51.282 --> 37:54.851
Willy Loman.
That was my father.

37:56.354 --> 37:58.688
Brought me from Budapest
when I was a kid.

38:00.058 --> 38:02.659
He bought into
the American Dream wholesale.

38:03.828 --> 38:07.597
He ran a hardware store,
worked like a bastard.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.568
Always thought people
looked down on him.

38:13.404 --> 38:15.572
You think it's all about work...

38:16.074 --> 38:17.574
ambition...

38:18.509 --> 38:22.079
Scrambling to the top of whatever
shitty hill you're climbing.

38:22.113 --> 38:24.247
So busy trying to
get somewhere you...

38:24.282 --> 38:29.119
you never stop to think...
maybe you're already there.

38:33.357 --> 38:36.860
Shit. It's Alec's birthday.
I forgot all about it.

38:36.894 --> 38:39.429
He's having a party tonight.
You should come.

38:40.531 --> 38:42.165
- Really? I don't...
- Nonsense.

38:43.701 --> 38:45.368
Who else am I gonna go with?

38:46.104 --> 38:47.771
(Whirring)

38:51.943 --> 38:53.944
(Grinding and squelching)

39:32.183 --> 39:33.850
(Funky music)

39:34.085 --> 39:35.685
♪ Yeah ♪

39:35.720 --> 39:37.420

(Dance music)

40:27.705 --> 40:31.041
All right, looks like
we have the plate.

40:31.809 --> 40:33.743
The car that took a pop at me,

40:33.778 --> 40:35.845
we have the license plate.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.415
It's registered to an address
on 28th Street.

40:38.449 --> 40:42.552
The DEA says
it used to be a dope house.

40:44.822 --> 40:46.323
That's the Lee brothers' place.

40:46.357 --> 40:48.358
They got that Chink restaurant
over on Franklin.

40:48.392 --> 40:49.726
Bamboo Pearl.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.461
The Lee brothers
are Clay Street.

40:51.495 --> 40:53.563
I fucking told you
it was the Chinks.

40:53.598 --> 40:55.699
We let them in, didn't we? Huh?

40:55.733 --> 41:00.070
We thought the Chinamen wouldn't get greedy.
They're buying up the fucking world.

41:00.104 --> 41:01.805
I say we hit 'em.

41:02.473 --> 41:04.441
I'll saddle up and hit 'em
right fucking now. Who's with me?

41:04.475 --> 41:07.244
We sit tight until my say.

41:09.146 --> 41:11.181
We're here to enjoy ourselves,
hm?

41:35.640 --> 41:37.307
(Dance music)

41:39.477 --> 41:42.245
- Been looking for you.
- I'm sorry?

41:43.714 --> 41:45.815
I said
I've been looking for you.

41:47.151 --> 41:49.586
- I could use a drink.
- I bet you could.

41:49.854 --> 41:53.456
You're not all you pretend
to be, are you, Jackie?

41:55.226 --> 41:58.628
When I gave you the piece you
couldn't do it, could you?

41:59.897 --> 42:01.898
What am I gonna do with you,
Jacks?

42:01.932 --> 42:03.633
Hm?

42:14.879 --> 42:16.546
Oh!

42:18.349 --> 42:20.016
(Toilet flushes)

42:20.818 --> 42:23.019
- Ah... no.
- Come on.

42:23.054 --> 42:24.821
Out, out. Out!

42:24.855 --> 42:27.223
- Sorry. Sorry...
- Come on. Come on, Jackie.

42:28.559 --> 42:30.393
No, come on.

42:30.428 --> 42:32.395
Fucking come on.

42:32.430 --> 42:34.097
Ooohh!

42:34.131 --> 42:35.832
(Exhales) Fuck!

42:46.777 --> 42:48.445
Hey.

42:56.153 --> 42:57.821
What happened to you?

42:58.589 --> 43:00.824
They have the license plate.

43:00.858 --> 43:02.559
What?

43:05.296 --> 43:06.930
Jimmy has a mole
in the department.

43:06.964 --> 43:08.598
There's no other way
he could know.

43:08.632 --> 43:11.301
Ah, Jesus.
You gotta get out of there.

43:13.404 --> 43:15.138
I tried to buy myself
some time.

43:17.441 --> 43:20.210
- I think I made it worse.
- You have to stop.

43:20.244 --> 43:21.945
I can't.

43:23.881 --> 43:25.682
You don't have anything, Grace.

43:26.850 --> 43:29.619
The bullets are connected.
I know they're connected.

43:29.653 --> 43:30.853
They don't match.

43:30.888 --> 43:32.722
Then we've got to find
the link.

43:34.491 --> 43:38.561
We've gotta keep trying. They
were made somewhere, right?

43:38.596 --> 43:41.698
On some kind of press
that must have left marks.

43:42.466 --> 43:44.133
We look for the marks.

43:44.401 --> 43:46.069
(Sniffs)

43:50.140 --> 43:51.774
He won't listen to me.

43:51.809 --> 43:53.509
Who?

43:54.445 --> 43:56.112
Dad.

43:56.580 --> 43:58.247
Again with this?

44:00.351 --> 44:02.852
He humiliates me
in front of everyone.

44:03.921 --> 44:05.588
I swear he fucking enjoys it.

44:08.993 --> 44:10.627
You wanna be taken seriously?

44:10.661 --> 44:13.229
Why don't you go out there
and prove yourself?

44:17.568 --> 44:19.235
You need to make them listen.

44:21.071 --> 44:24.907
How long are you gonna keep
waiting on Daddy's permission?

44:46.330 --> 44:48.331
(Rap music in background)

44:50.434 --> 44:52.101
(Cellphone rings)

44:54.571 --> 44:55.772
Mitch?

44:55.806 --> 44:58.841
You were right. The bullets
were made on the same press.

44:59.276 --> 45:01.210
Looks like the press
is home-made.

45:02.146 --> 45:03.813
It's untraceable.

45:05.382 --> 45:07.383
Travis? Travis?

45:12.156 --> 45:13.256
Evie?

45:14.558 --> 45:16.225
Fuck. Shit.

45:20.464 --> 45:22.131
Is that pot?

45:24.001 --> 45:25.668
What do you want, Mom?

45:26.036 --> 45:28.471
Well, I wanted to talk
about this, but...

45:28.505 --> 45:30.173
I don't know which is worse.

45:30.207 --> 45:32.775
I'll try better at school.
Can I go now?

45:33.544 --> 45:35.945
I'm sorry
that I haven't been around.

45:38.415 --> 45:40.883
I know you're going through
a lot right now.

45:41.385 --> 45:43.853
- Doesn't matter.
- It does.

45:45.289 --> 45:47.924
You don't understand.
It really doesn't.

45:49.993 --> 45:52.328
It's not like I miss you
or anything.

45:52.362 --> 45:54.797
Even when you're home
you're not there.

45:56.700 --> 45:58.367
There's nothing to miss, Mom.

46:00.437 --> 46:03.172
You always cared more
about Sam than you did about me.

46:06.376 --> 46:08.010
That's not true.

46:08.045 --> 46:09.746
You still do.

46:10.114 --> 46:11.781
He's dead.

46:12.883 --> 46:14.550
Is that what you think?

46:15.385 --> 46:17.053
Huh?

46:19.123 --> 46:21.958
I love you so much.
You have no idea.

46:26.029 --> 46:27.964
My friends are waiting.

46:27.998 --> 46:29.699
You gotta be kidding.

47:41.605 --> 47:43.606
(JIMMY) So what have you got?

47:53.250 --> 47:55.885
You self-serving
son of a bitch.

47:56.486 --> 47:58.154
You got a UC in with Laszlo?

47:59.323 --> 48:02.124
- What are you talking about?
- Don't fucking lie to me!

48:02.893 --> 48:05.895
- Who told you?
- Never you fucking mind.

48:06.697 --> 48:09.131
I'm giving you one chance
to tell me the truth.

48:09.166 --> 48:10.867
Who is it?

48:12.202 --> 48:13.669
Grace Travis.

48:15.072 --> 48:16.939
Fucking asshole.

48:18.575 --> 48:20.576
She's been compromised.

48:24.248 --> 48:26.682
- Grace?
- (Sighs)

48:26.717 --> 48:28.417
What are you doing here?

48:29.553 --> 48:32.755
I came to speak to Evie
about her report card.

48:34.825 --> 48:36.759
Did you know she's smoking pot?

48:38.328 --> 48:39.929
Shit.

48:40.464 --> 48:43.599
- Thought I dealt with that.
- I don't know what to do, Tommy.

48:45.469 --> 48:47.136
I don't know what to do.

48:48.772 --> 48:50.940
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

48:52.542 --> 48:54.210
It's not.

48:55.846 --> 48:57.513
You don't have to say that.

49:03.453 --> 49:05.121
Just tell what to do.

49:07.624 --> 49:11.827
You know what to do.
You gotta let this go.

49:11.862 --> 49:13.896
It's killing you, Grace.
Come on!

49:14.364 --> 49:17.533
It's not gonna bring you any peace.
It's not gonna make this any easier.

49:17.567 --> 49:21.337
This is never going to be easier.
You gotta start to live with that.

49:24.875 --> 49:26.676
Come home.

49:26.944 --> 49:29.378
Just... just come home.

49:31.648 --> 49:33.316
Okay.

49:36.987 --> 49:38.387
I'll come home.

49:44.528 --> 49:46.529
I'm gonna go get my shit.

49:48.131 --> 49:50.099
Okay.

50:08.685 --> 50:10.486
Did you find Grace?

50:10.520 --> 50:12.188
She changes numbers so fucking often.

50:12.222 --> 50:14.824
Try every number
you ever called her on.

50:15.359 --> 50:18.861
If that doesn't work you go to every
single place you know she's ever hung out.

50:18.895 --> 50:20.663
You get out there and find her.

50:21.098 --> 50:23.099
This is on you.

50:24.868 --> 50:26.535
(Cellphone rings)

50:29.206 --> 50:30.873
(Terminates call)

50:46.123 --> 50:47.623
(Door closes, she gasps)

50:50.327 --> 50:51.994
(Jimmy chuckles)

50:53.597 --> 50:56.432
Didn't think you know
how to use one of those.

50:56.466 --> 50:58.167
You scared the shit out of me.

51:01.304 --> 51:02.972
You going somewhere?

51:03.607 --> 51:05.875
Always disappearing on me,
Jacks.

51:05.909 --> 51:07.610
What are you running from?

51:08.378 --> 51:10.379
I just needed to get away
for a bit.

51:11.014 --> 51:13.582
- Come up for a little air.
- Do I suffocate you?

51:13.617 --> 51:15.284
- Is it that bad?
- No.

51:15.318 --> 51:17.386
- It's not that.
- (Cellphone rings)

51:19.389 --> 51:21.057
Nervous there, Jacks?

51:21.658 --> 51:23.659
- Answer it.
- No, it's okay.

51:23.693 --> 51:25.394
I'll leave it.

51:26.363 --> 51:28.030
What do you want, Jimmy?

51:28.732 --> 51:30.800
Someone really wants
to talk to you.

51:33.203 --> 51:34.870
(Continues ringing)

51:36.740 --> 51:38.407
(Terminates call)

51:42.145 --> 51:46.215
I've got a new contact that might interest you.
Someone with a direct route,

51:46.249 --> 51:47.950
out of Kaohsiung.

51:50.153 --> 51:51.821
He wants to meet.

51:55.358 --> 51:57.226
Now?

51:57.260 --> 51:59.061
You got somewhere else
you need to be?

52:23.854 --> 52:25.521
Grace!

52:26.389 --> 52:28.057
Grace!

52:28.725 --> 52:29.859
Fuck!

52:50.680 --> 52:52.815
- Jimmy?
- Hm?

52:54.484 --> 52:56.385
Jimmy,
where are we meeting him?

53:16.206 --> 53:17.873
It's all right.

53:31.154 --> 53:32.821
Jimmy, I...

53:37.127 --> 53:39.328
Everything's gonna be
all right...

53:44.668 --> 53:47.102
Grace.

53:49.003 --> 53:51.565
_

54:08.324 --> 54:11.812
_

54:25.308 --> 54:26.809
(Panting)

54:36.720 --> 54:37.820
(Grunts)

55:40.317 --> 55:41.417
Yargh!

55:41.451 --> 55:42.751
Agh!

55:43.420 --> 55:45.521
Wait, wait! Jimmy, please!
God, please!

55:45.555 --> 55:47.356
Please, Jimmy,
you don't need to do this!

55:47.390 --> 55:49.158
Tell me everything
the cops know.

55:50.126 --> 55:52.895
They pulled me out from
undercover four months ago.

55:52.929 --> 55:54.930
Tell me what they know.

55:54.964 --> 55:58.334
I'm... I'm not targeting you
any more.

55:58.368 --> 56:00.369
I was building a case.

56:00.403 --> 56:02.404
The dummy meds.

56:02.439 --> 56:05.307
The deal didn't go through,
they don't have anything.

56:05.342 --> 56:07.276
You don't have to lie to me
anymore.

56:07.310 --> 56:11.180
If they had anything, they'd have
moved against you by now. I'm not.

56:11.214 --> 56:13.215
Please, Jimmy,
I'm not targeting you.

56:13.249 --> 56:15.117
I'm not after you, I swear it.

56:15.151 --> 56:16.852
What the fuck
are you doing here?

56:19.322 --> 56:20.989
My son.

56:21.024 --> 56:22.224
What?

56:22.792 --> 56:25.127
My son was killed
four months ago.

56:25.161 --> 56:27.162
He was seven years old.

56:27.197 --> 56:30.432
That's why they pulled me off
the case, that's why I disappeared.

56:31.634 --> 56:33.602
What does this have to do
with me?

56:33.936 --> 56:35.971
He was killed in a drive-by.

56:37.040 --> 56:39.341
And the bullet that hit him
was home-made.

56:39.375 --> 56:41.410
The same kind that killed Tony.

56:45.682 --> 56:49.317
The same kind they pulled out of my
shoulder, the one that was meant for you.

56:50.887 --> 56:53.455
Clay Street aren't moving
against you, Jimmy.

56:53.489 --> 56:56.591
They're burying their grandfather,
they're in fucking mourning.

56:56.626 --> 56:58.794
They're not moving
against anybody.

56:59.729 --> 57:01.697
Somebody's setting you up.

57:01.731 --> 57:03.632
Listen to me, listen to me.

57:03.666 --> 57:07.269
How do you know it's not somebody close
to you, somebody from your own crew?

57:07.303 --> 57:08.837
Fuck you!

57:08.871 --> 57:10.972
Whoever it is,
they murdered my son!

57:12.175 --> 57:14.142
And they tried to kill you.

57:14.177 --> 57:17.612
Please! Please! Let me help you.
Let me help you.

57:17.647 --> 57:19.614
Why should I ever trust you?
Why?

57:19.649 --> 57:21.650
We want the same people.

57:21.684 --> 57:24.686
We want the same people, I'm not after you.
I can help you.

57:24.721 --> 57:28.223
No, you stood there and you let
me kill Grindenko, didn't you?

57:28.825 --> 57:30.792
What was I supposed to do?

57:30.827 --> 57:32.627
It was him or me.

57:32.662 --> 57:34.396
Now it's you.

57:36.499 --> 57:38.667
- Look at me.
- No, no, no. You don't need to do this.

57:38.701 --> 57:40.702
- Look at me!
- You can't do this!

57:40.737 --> 57:42.771
- You can't!
- Look at me!

57:57.253 --> 57:59.254
You are dead now.

58:00.156 --> 58:02.491
I know who you are,
I know where you live.

58:02.525 --> 58:04.559
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow.

58:05.061 --> 58:07.429
But you are dead.

58:16.038 --> 58:17.105
(Door slams)

58:43.800 --> 58:45.801
Jesus Christ, Grace!

58:47.470 --> 58:49.838
- What happened?
- Don't! Don't look at me!

58:49.872 --> 58:51.740
Fuck, Grace!

58:51.774 --> 58:53.108
Get out!

59:01.284 --> 59:03.151
Tell me.

59:04.020 --> 59:05.620
Tell me.

59:11.260 --> 59:13.261
Oh, Tom...

59:22.805 --> 59:24.506
I'm so sorry.

59:26.709 --> 59:28.543
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

59:28.578 --> 59:29.744
It's okay.

01:00:36.812 --> 01:00:38.813
(Grunting)

01:00:46.756 --> 01:00:48.757
(Panting)

01:01:23.526 --> 01:01:25.527
(Bleeping)

01:01:52.621 --> 01:01:53.989
What's going on?

01:01:54.957 --> 01:01:56.925
Everything good, chief?

01:01:56.959 --> 01:01:58.994
We need to clean house.

01:01:59.862 --> 01:02:02.630
New phones, new routines.

01:02:03.933 --> 01:02:05.934
Yeah, I got it.

01:02:08.804 --> 01:02:10.572
What are you doing here?

01:02:12.208 --> 01:02:14.876
If I don't go home by 10:30,
I don't get to go home at all.

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:16.911
Is that your rule or Nancy's?

01:02:16.946 --> 01:02:19.647
That's a rule that has
advantages to both parties.

01:02:30.259 --> 01:02:31.693
Drink?

01:02:50.546 --> 01:02:52.514
Evie needs a change.

01:02:52.548 --> 01:02:54.582
She won't admit it,
of course, but...

01:02:55.985 --> 01:02:57.986
Maybe that's what we all need...

01:02:58.988 --> 01:03:00.989
..a clean start
somewhere new.

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:06.995
I'm not talking about
running or forgetting.

01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:09.030
I'm just...

01:03:09.065 --> 01:03:11.633
We need to give ourselves
a chance, you know?

01:03:17.406 --> 01:03:19.407
We can do this, Grace.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.111
We can do this.

01:03:26.048 --> 01:03:27.682
To Tony.

01:03:27.716 --> 01:03:29.384
Tony.

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:44.833
I remember the first time you
brought him down here to the docks.

01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:47.669
He had that suit that was about
eight sizes too big.

01:03:47.703 --> 01:03:49.804
I said, "That kid looks like
an accountant."

01:03:49.839 --> 01:03:53.108
You said, "He is an accountant
and he's gonna make us rich."

01:03:53.142 --> 01:03:55.176
And he did.

01:03:56.579 --> 01:03:58.146
Yeah, he did.

01:04:00.783 --> 01:04:02.784
It ain't fucking right.

01:04:03.919 --> 01:04:06.087
Tony was not part of this,
he was never violent.

01:04:07.156 --> 01:04:09.124
It ain't fucking right.

01:04:09.158 --> 01:04:10.291
Hm.

01:04:20.836 --> 01:04:22.837
(Vehicle approaches)

01:04:56.739 --> 01:04:58.039
Christ, Travis!

01:04:58.073 --> 01:05:00.074
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:02.110
Your phone's off.

01:05:02.144 --> 01:05:04.546
- I'm on compassionate leave.
- Bullshit! Compassionate leave...

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.948
Wilson's been looking
for you all night.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.218
Home with my family.
What do you expect?

01:05:10.252 --> 01:05:12.287
Frankly, I expected you
to be dead.

01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:16.891
You're compromised.

01:05:18.494 --> 01:05:20.061
How? How do you know that?

01:05:20.896 --> 01:05:22.564
There's chatter.

01:05:24.266 --> 01:05:25.366
Chatter?

01:05:25.401 --> 01:05:27.068
Who from, Laszlo's crew?

01:05:27.102 --> 01:05:30.538
I gave you a direct goddamn
order and you ignored it.

01:05:30.573 --> 01:05:32.273
Now stay the fuck
out of Oakland.

01:05:32.308 --> 01:05:34.042
I need to know who made me
and how.

01:05:34.076 --> 01:05:37.879
Your captain in San Jose will hear
about your conduct in the morning.

01:05:37.913 --> 01:05:39.781
Get yourself a good union
lawyer.

01:05:39.815 --> 01:05:40.949
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you,

01:05:40.983 --> 01:05:43.318
for making me drive all night,
thinking you were dead.

01:05:46.922 --> 01:05:48.890
So, um... on your travels...

01:05:48.924 --> 01:05:50.692
did you get anything
from Jimmy?

01:05:50.726 --> 01:05:52.160
Like what?

01:05:52.194 --> 01:05:55.129
You know, like anything on the Tony Aldon
murder might be useful to me.

01:05:55.164 --> 01:05:56.664
No.

01:06:00.636 --> 01:06:02.437
Well, at least she's not dead.

01:06:02.471 --> 01:06:04.239
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:06:04.273 --> 01:06:05.306
Me?

01:06:05.341 --> 01:06:07.408
Running her without
authorization.

01:06:07.443 --> 01:06:09.043
Come on.
She was running herself.

01:06:09.078 --> 01:06:11.479
One more fuck-up from you
and I go after your badge.

01:06:11.513 --> 01:06:12.580
Understand?

01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:15.850
Yes, Lieutenant, I understand.

01:06:17.186 --> 01:06:19.187
How are the boys holding up?

01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:22.824
The boys are fine.

01:06:30.232 --> 01:06:31.933
What about you?

01:06:52.821 --> 01:06:54.822
Everybody's got your back,
Jimmy.

01:06:56.425 --> 01:06:59.794
We're gonna get through this.
We've gotten through worse.

01:07:03.732 --> 01:07:04.766
Hm.

01:07:09.972 --> 01:07:11.973
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:07:24.987 --> 01:07:26.821
You're going back, aren't you?

01:07:32.728 --> 01:07:35.596
You never had any intention
of giving this a chance.

01:07:38.033 --> 01:07:40.001
That's not true.

01:07:40.035 --> 01:07:41.202
Don't.

01:07:43.238 --> 01:07:46.274
Don't. Just stop giving me
any fucking hope, okay?

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.348
RADIO: "Here we are
in the Bay area.

01:07:53.382 --> 01:07:56.017
Hope you're having a great time.
Talk to me..."

01:08:14.303 --> 01:08:16.104
Let me get two El Pastor.

01:08:16.138 --> 01:08:18.139
I'm not open yet. I'm sorry.

01:08:18.173 --> 01:08:19.707
Hey!

01:08:19.742 --> 01:08:21.376
- Face down, homie!
- Okay. Okay, okay.

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.678
- I said, face down!
- Please, please...

01:08:23.712 --> 01:08:26.080
I said stay the fuck on the ground.

01:08:26.115 --> 01:08:29.417
Take the money, don't take
the truck. I have no insurance, please!

01:08:35.157 --> 01:08:36.524
No, please.

01:08:36.558 --> 01:08:38.593
No, no. Please, please!

01:08:42.663 --> 01:08:45.232
I'm gonna go and put you
on the wireless system.

01:08:45.267 --> 01:08:47.268
This is what we use
in Vallejo PD.

01:08:47.301 --> 01:08:49.437
Can you make sure we get
the whole street?

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:51.339
So I can see which cars
are parked.

01:08:51.372 --> 01:08:52.607
Hey, where are you going?

01:08:53.742 --> 01:08:55.209
To school.

01:08:55.243 --> 01:08:57.278
- Yeah, I'm gonna drive you.
- I'm taking the bus.

01:08:57.312 --> 01:08:58.946
No, I will drive you.

01:08:58.981 --> 01:09:00.247
Why?

01:09:00.282 --> 01:09:02.917
Do I need a reason?
Can't I just wanna drive you?

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.687
What do you have upstairs?

01:09:06.721 --> 01:09:08.856
Master bedroom
and two kids', right?

01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:10.591
Yeah. Two.

01:09:10.626 --> 01:09:12.960
Is it okay if I go through back,
see what you need?

01:09:12.995 --> 01:09:14.694
Sure.

01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:17.965
- I'm gonna be late.
- He's almost done. Now, listen.

01:09:17.765 --> 01:09:20.835
From now on, if you need
a ride, you call me.

01:09:20.868 --> 01:09:22.837
You got it?

01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:24.104
Got it.

01:09:24.139 --> 01:09:26.140
And I will pick you up,
or Dad will.

01:09:26.174 --> 01:09:28.209
Which means Dad will.

01:09:31.078 --> 01:09:33.981
So I noticed Dad didn't sleep
on the couch last night.

01:09:34.015 --> 01:09:36.050
Yeah. You noticed that,
did you?

01:09:37.419 --> 01:09:39.687
Does this mean
you're staying home now?

01:09:41.023 --> 01:09:43.189
I want you to come straight home
after school.

01:09:43.692 --> 01:09:46.193
Why? What's the big deal?

01:09:46.962 --> 01:09:48.462
Nothing.

01:09:49.831 --> 01:09:51.799
I thought I would cook,

01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:53.434
make Ziggy's lasagna.

01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:56.303
Fine.

01:09:56.338 --> 01:09:57.605
Yeah?

01:09:57.639 --> 01:09:59.040
Yeah.

01:10:01.476 --> 01:10:02.877
Good.

01:10:03.979 --> 01:10:05.980
(Cellphone rings)

01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:08.549
Travis.

01:10:09.785 --> 01:10:11.252
Yes, sir.

01:10:11.286 --> 01:10:13.320
I'll be there.

01:10:14.856 --> 01:10:17.625
I have to go back to the shop,
pick up a couple more sensors.

01:10:17.659 --> 01:10:19.694
Good. Can we go now?

01:11:49.117 --> 01:11:51.118
What's wrong?

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:54.155
Nothing, it's just work shit.

01:11:55.023 --> 01:11:56.590
Your boss lady again?

01:11:57.626 --> 01:12:00.961
Why is it that women in power are
always bigger assholes than men?

01:12:01.797 --> 01:12:03.230
I have lady boss.

01:12:03.265 --> 01:12:05.366
Then you know
what I'm talking about.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.767
No.

01:12:08.103 --> 01:12:11.138
Man boss much worse.
Trust me.

01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.742
I guess it depends on
your line of business.

01:12:23.318 --> 01:12:24.885
(Giggles)

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.821
Hey, hold on.

01:12:26.855 --> 01:12:29.023
We've still got business
to discuss.

01:12:33.528 --> 01:12:34.728
So...

01:12:36.331 --> 01:12:38.933
who's running the grow houses
in Tuxedo these days?

01:12:38.967 --> 01:12:40.968
Depends what street.

01:12:41.002 --> 01:12:42.436
28th Street.

01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:46.040
It's a little green bungalow with
black plastic on the windows.

01:12:46.641 --> 01:12:50.978
Everything above 20th Street
belong to Lee brothers.

01:12:51.947 --> 01:12:53.948
Clay Street.

01:13:11.733 --> 01:13:13.734
Your money's over there.

01:13:18.506 --> 01:13:21.475
All right, listen up!
We're gonna be tightening ship.

01:13:21.509 --> 01:13:24.845
Which means we swap out
cellphones.

01:13:25.914 --> 01:13:27.882
So let me have the old ones.

01:13:27.916 --> 01:13:29.350
Right here.

01:13:30.518 --> 01:13:31.719
Come on, come on.

01:13:35.457 --> 01:13:39.560
Now, Jimmy,
in his infinite generosity,

01:13:40.295 --> 01:13:43.898
will be providing each of you a
fresh cellphone every two weeks.

01:13:45.133 --> 01:13:47.368
Yeah, and who's paying
for the minutes?

01:13:47.402 --> 01:13:48.869
(SNIGGERING)

01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:50.337
Pay as you go.

01:13:50.372 --> 01:13:52.406
Just like your sister.

01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:17.598
Ruby?

01:14:22.837 --> 01:14:24.838
There you go. Two hands.

01:14:25.573 --> 01:14:27.841
- Thank you, Daddy.
- You're welcome, baby.

01:14:27.876 --> 01:14:30.044
Uncle Max is coming home today.
Are you excited?

01:14:30.078 --> 01:14:32.112
(Ruby laughs) Yeah?

01:14:32.781 --> 01:14:34.448
Good girl.

01:14:34.482 --> 01:14:36.183
Go play.

01:14:37.285 --> 01:14:38.686
What time
are we picking him up?

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.254
Dad's getting him.

01:14:40.288 --> 01:14:42.323
You're not going?

01:14:43.291 --> 01:14:45.392
He wants to do it himself.

01:14:45.427 --> 01:14:48.162
We should all be there to
welcome Max, especially you.

01:14:48.196 --> 01:14:49.496
I know.

01:14:49.531 --> 01:14:51.598
Doesn't he have enough
on his plate right now?

01:14:51.633 --> 01:14:53.634
It's the way he wants it.

01:14:53.668 --> 01:14:56.437
You don't have to worry
about every little detail.

01:15:10.485 --> 01:15:12.486
Thank God he has you.

01:15:14.823 --> 01:15:17.758
Let's face it, delegating has
never been his strong suit.

01:15:19.227 --> 01:15:20.928
He delegates.

01:15:23.264 --> 01:15:25.799
Has he delegated our little
Chinese problem?

01:15:29.704 --> 01:15:31.238
That'll be taken care of.

01:15:31.773 --> 01:15:33.741
They almost killed your father.

01:15:33.775 --> 01:15:36.577
The days are going by
and nobody is doing anything about it.

01:15:36.611 --> 01:15:38.245
- Come on!
- I'm serious.

01:15:38.279 --> 01:15:41.448
It's getting to the point where I'm nervous
taking our daughter out in public.

01:15:41.483 --> 01:15:44.451
I don't want you to be nervous.
I am taking care of it.

01:15:53.928 --> 01:15:55.896
It pisses me off.

01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:57.231
What?

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:01.568
He has no idea how lucky
he is to have you.

01:16:03.705 --> 01:16:05.205
He knows.

01:16:16.718 --> 01:16:18.819
BANKER: Are you sure
this is the right account?

01:16:18.853 --> 01:16:20.454
JIMMY: Quite sure.

01:16:20.488 --> 01:16:22.189
Why, is there a problem?

01:16:22.223 --> 01:16:25.292
The system is showing a balance
of zero dollars in this account.

01:16:25.326 --> 01:16:27.661
That's impossible.
My accountant told me

01:16:27.695 --> 01:16:32.399
Aldon transferred a significant amount
of money into this account two days ago.

01:16:32.767 --> 01:16:35.035
Perhaps you could discuss this
with your accountant.

01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:37.704
My accountant is not available.
Check it again.

01:16:38.306 --> 01:16:39.907
The system is showing--

01:16:39.941 --> 01:16:43.510
"System is showing"? What the fuck does that
supposed to mean? "The system is showing"?

01:16:43.545 --> 01:16:45.646
Mr. Laszlo, I have to ask you
to keep your voice down.

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.116
And I'll have to ask you
to locate my fucking money!

01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:52.086
There was never any money
in this account, Mr. Laszlo.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.154
There's nothing
for me to locate.

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:16.510
(Buzzer)

01:17:16.544 --> 01:17:18.245
Good luck out there, Max.

01:17:18.279 --> 01:17:19.947
Thank you.

01:17:26.888 --> 01:17:28.889
(Beeping)

01:17:36.631 --> 01:17:38.432
Jesus, Jimmy!

01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:42.736
- What's the matter?
- Where's my money?

01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:43.937
Money? What money?

01:17:43.972 --> 01:17:45.539
The 25 million
your husband stole from me.

01:17:45.573 --> 01:17:47.107
I've got no idea what you're
talking about.

01:17:47.142 --> 01:17:49.943
Bullshit! Where you packing off
to in such a hurry?

01:17:49.978 --> 01:17:52.646
I am moving back to Stockton
to be with my mother.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.849
Fuck your mother! Nobody goes
anywhere until I get my money.

01:17:55.884 --> 01:17:57.784
There is no money, Jimmy,
there never was.

01:17:57.819 --> 01:18:00.287
Take a look around. This place has
been falling apart for years.

01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:02.856
Who was Tony meeting
before he died, who was he talking to?

01:18:02.891 --> 01:18:04.525
Nobody. Tony never talked to anybody.

01:18:04.559 --> 01:18:07.794
- He didn't do this alone.
- I think you should leave.

01:18:07.829 --> 01:18:09.830
I was good to you,
I was good to Tony.

01:18:09.864 --> 01:18:11.899
All I asked for
was a bit of loyalty.

01:18:11.933 --> 01:18:14.701
He was loyal.
That was his problem.

01:18:14.736 --> 01:18:18.305
Poor stupid Tony was always on your
side, despite what anybody said.

01:18:21.376 --> 01:18:22.676
Look at you.

01:18:22.710 --> 01:18:26.246
Tony was your friend and here
you are terrorizing his widow.

01:18:26.281 --> 01:18:28.315
You've inherited his debt,
Lizzie.

01:18:55.677 --> 01:18:57.678
(Cellphone rings)

01:18:59.881 --> 01:19:01.281
What?

01:19:01.316 --> 01:19:03.383
ALEC: You with Max yet?
Put him on.

01:19:03.418 --> 01:19:05.686
Max? Oh, fuck. Thanks.

01:19:59.407 --> 01:20:01.074
You said that would go smoothly.

01:20:01.109 --> 01:20:03.510
You said you weren't
going to say anything.

01:20:03.544 --> 01:20:05.545
No, no. I did not say that. You did.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:10.183
It's a temporary suspension, with pay, pending
an IAD investigation. This is standard.

01:20:10.218 --> 01:20:11.718
Listen...

01:20:11.753 --> 01:20:15.656
in light of what happened to your son
and the nature of the misconduct,

01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:18.258
they're going to take your
mental state into account.

01:20:19.727 --> 01:20:21.228
My mental state?

01:20:21.262 --> 01:20:23.363
They're likely to order
a psychiatric evaluation.

01:20:23.398 --> 01:20:25.399
Well, I won't agree to that.

01:20:25.433 --> 01:20:27.434
Don't give them any more ammo.

01:20:27.468 --> 01:20:30.537
Okay, just lay low
and don't stonewall.

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.874
Go home, Grace.

01:20:33.908 --> 01:20:35.742
Be with your family.

01:20:54.195 --> 01:20:55.862
You okay?

01:20:55.897 --> 01:20:57.931
I'm fine.

01:21:00.935 --> 01:21:02.936
You look good. Hm?

01:21:04.539 --> 01:21:06.540
There's no shade in the yard.

01:21:07.208 --> 01:21:09.443
You either stay inside
or rot in the sun.

01:21:09.477 --> 01:21:11.511
At least they let you exercise.

01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:15.215
I read a lot.

01:21:15.249 --> 01:21:17.751
I read all the classics,
some of them twice.

01:21:17.785 --> 01:21:19.286
Anything good?

01:21:20.655 --> 01:21:23.223
After a while,
they all start to blur together.

01:21:23.257 --> 01:21:25.158
Fucking 12 months, huh?

01:21:25.193 --> 01:21:29.396
For resisting arrest when they had no
cause to arrest you in the first place.

01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:33.099
That fucking judge should be
disrobed and disbarred.

01:21:33.134 --> 01:21:35.168
Legalized criminals.

01:21:37.271 --> 01:21:39.272
I don't blame the judge.

01:21:40.608 --> 01:21:42.843
Anyway, I'm trying not
to hold grudges.

01:21:42.877 --> 01:21:44.878
Well, you're a better man
than me.

01:21:44.912 --> 01:21:46.947
(Laughs)

01:21:47.715 --> 01:21:49.716
We already knew that.

01:22:24.518 --> 01:22:26.486
Alec couldn't come to meet me?

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.555
No, I wanted to pick you up
myself.

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.693
Listen, Max...

01:22:35.062 --> 01:22:37.063
you're gonna get back on track.

01:22:37.565 --> 01:22:39.532
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:22:39.567 --> 01:22:40.900
Thanks.

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.741
How's business?

01:22:48.909 --> 01:22:50.910
Business is okay.

01:22:52.079 --> 01:22:54.381
It's gonna be much better
now that you're back.

01:22:54.415 --> 01:22:56.416
Yeah, it's good to be home.

01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:57.817
Yes.

01:23:00.554 --> 01:23:03.657
Listen. I need to drop you at the house.
There's something I have to do.

01:23:03.691 --> 01:23:05.325
Just drop me off here.
I can walk.

01:23:05.359 --> 01:23:06.793
Are you sure?

01:23:06.827 --> 01:23:09.596
I haven't taken a walk
in 12 months. I don't mind.

01:23:10.464 --> 01:23:11.865
All right.

01:23:12.967 --> 01:23:14.801
I'll see you back at the house.

01:23:14.835 --> 01:23:17.671
- For six o'clock.
- Sure.

01:23:19.407 --> 01:23:21.174
It's good to see you, Dad.

01:23:21.208 --> 01:23:23.076
It's good to see you too, Max.

01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:24.944
Good to see you.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.367
Hey.

01:23:47.401 --> 01:23:49.703
- How you doing?
- Hey, man! How you doing?

01:23:49.737 --> 01:23:51.771
Good to see you.
How you been?

01:24:01.549 --> 01:24:02.949
How'd you get in here?

01:24:02.983 --> 01:24:06.386
You must be the only cop in America
who can't break into a car.

01:24:11.358 --> 01:24:13.059
I got burned.

01:24:14.061 --> 01:24:16.062
Jimmy knew my real name.

01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:18.965
How come you're still alive?

01:24:19.834 --> 01:24:21.234
I dunno.

01:24:22.103 --> 01:24:24.104
But somebody in Oakland
burned me.

01:24:24.972 --> 01:24:26.973
And we need to smoke 'em out.

01:24:27.908 --> 01:24:29.109
We?

01:24:29.143 --> 01:24:31.611
Yeah, I need your password
for the database.

01:24:31.645 --> 01:24:33.780
IAD suspended me.

01:24:33.814 --> 01:24:35.248
Whoa, whoa.

01:24:35.282 --> 01:24:38.551
Someone in Oakland
sold me out. All right?

01:24:38.586 --> 01:24:41.187
Now they're trying to take
my badge. Think about it.

01:24:41.222 --> 01:24:42.589
Why now?

01:24:42.623 --> 01:24:45.592
Probably because you're making
somebody very nervous. Me included.

01:24:45.626 --> 01:24:47.727
Come on, Mitch, don't be an asshole.
Give me your password.

01:24:47.762 --> 01:24:49.462
I'd like to help.

01:24:49.497 --> 01:24:51.131
Then help.

01:24:51.165 --> 01:24:53.166
If they find out,

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.435
they're gonna come
after my badge too.

01:24:56.170 --> 01:24:58.171
I got too much to lose here.

01:24:59.106 --> 01:25:01.107
You wanna talk about loss?

01:25:08.249 --> 01:25:09.916
Maybe they're right.

01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:11.951
You should just
take a little time,

01:25:11.986 --> 01:25:14.020
go be with your family.

01:25:25.299 --> 01:25:27.500
(Rap music blares
on car sound system)

01:25:34.942 --> 01:25:36.943
Guess what, motherfuckers?

01:25:38.112 --> 01:25:39.245
What?

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.581
I'm retiring.

01:25:41.615 --> 01:25:44.117
(Chuckles) Retiring from what?

01:25:44.952 --> 01:25:48.955
I'm gonna fulfill my childhood dream
of owning my very own taco truck.

01:25:51.926 --> 01:25:53.760
You two know
where I could find one?

01:25:54.862 --> 01:25:57.864
Um... check the classifieds?

01:25:57.898 --> 01:25:58.998
Yeah.

01:26:00.501 --> 01:26:02.101
That's funny.

01:26:02.136 --> 01:26:04.137
I did check the classifieds.

01:26:04.171 --> 01:26:07.106
Only what caught my attention
was a certain headline

01:26:07.141 --> 01:26:10.043
about two fucking idiots
who robbed a father of three

01:26:10.077 --> 01:26:12.445
and fled the scene
in his diarrhea wagon.

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:14.581
What'd you do with the truck?

01:26:14.615 --> 01:26:17.450
I pushed it in the reservoir.
It's gone, it's fine.

01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:22.188
Jesus. That's your own mother's
drinking water, you know that?

01:26:24.191 --> 01:26:26.192
I'm sorry, man.

01:26:32.333 --> 01:26:34.334
I got a job coming up.

01:27:18.312 --> 01:27:19.412
Jacks.

01:27:20.614 --> 01:27:22.315
Back up!

01:27:23.417 --> 01:27:25.685
You always bring your piece
to the supermarket?

01:27:25.719 --> 01:27:27.553
I mean it. Back up!

01:27:27.588 --> 01:27:29.589
This the real you, is it?

01:27:29.623 --> 01:27:31.357
(Tuts)

01:27:35.095 --> 01:27:39.565
You know everything about me. It's only
fair I know a little something about you.

01:27:40.434 --> 01:27:42.402
What the fuck do you want?

01:27:42.436 --> 01:27:44.437
Be here this evening.

01:27:44.471 --> 01:27:46.272
At six.

01:27:49.944 --> 01:27:51.945
Leave the piece at home.

01:27:54.548 --> 01:27:56.549
Bring a bottle.

01:29:00.014 --> 01:29:02.015
(Bleeping)

01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:09.533
_

01:29:16.363 --> 01:29:18.364
(Phone rings)

01:29:25.305 --> 01:29:27.140
Detective Mitchell?

01:29:28.075 --> 01:29:29.675
Lieutenant.

01:29:29.710 --> 01:29:31.444
It's been a long time.

01:29:31.478 --> 01:29:34.514
So how's life in... Where is it
you landed, Santa Cruz?

01:29:35.115 --> 01:29:37.083
San Jose.

01:29:37.117 --> 01:29:39.185
It's wonderful.
Thanks for asking.

01:29:39.219 --> 01:29:42.188
Too bad you opted for early retirement.
Oakland misses you.

01:29:43.157 --> 01:29:45.491
I wish I could say
the feeling was mutual.

01:29:47.094 --> 01:29:49.062
So what can I do for you,
Lieutenant?

01:29:49.096 --> 01:29:52.498
I see you just ran a NCIC search
on Jimmy Laszlo.

01:29:54.368 --> 01:29:56.436
You have him flagged?

01:29:56.470 --> 01:30:00.673
Why would a fucking cold-case desk jockey
in San Jose be interested in Laszlo?

01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:04.177
Just a shot in the dark.

01:30:04.211 --> 01:30:05.945
Enlighten me.

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.314
Uh...

01:30:08.348 --> 01:30:10.349
Ballistics
pulled a possible link

01:30:10.384 --> 01:30:14.287
between a cold file of mine
and an associate of Laszlo's.

01:30:17.858 --> 01:30:21.027
The recently departed Tony
Aldon, Oakland, California.

01:30:21.061 --> 01:30:23.096
So what's the link?

01:30:26.033 --> 01:30:28.267
Both hit with the same
home-made bullet.

01:30:28.302 --> 01:30:29.836
Turned out to be nothing.

01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:31.571
Doesn't sound like
nothing to me.

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:36.509
I'm just dotting the I's before I
move onto the next, Lieutenant.

01:30:36.543 --> 01:30:38.111
From now on,

01:30:38.145 --> 01:30:41.547
anything you have down in San
Jose with a link to Jimmy Laszlo,

01:30:41.582 --> 01:30:44.350
I need it folded
into my operation,

01:30:44.384 --> 01:30:46.919
whether you perceive it
to be nothing or not.

01:30:46.954 --> 01:30:48.988
Sure thing.

01:31:02.102 --> 01:31:04.103
(Music and laughter)

01:31:05.739 --> 01:31:07.039
Steve.

01:31:07.074 --> 01:31:08.708
Good to see you.

01:31:08.742 --> 01:31:11.377
- Where the hell is Max?
- Relax, he'll be here.

01:31:12.146 --> 01:31:15.214
You know he does it on purpose
just to be the center of attention.

01:31:16.049 --> 01:31:18.017
Oh, shit, we're out of ice.

01:31:18.051 --> 01:31:20.953
Will you get some more?
I'll check on the barbecue.

01:31:24.458 --> 01:31:26.459
- Daddy!
- Hey, baby girl.

01:31:27.094 --> 01:31:29.061
Where's Grandpa?

01:31:29.663 --> 01:31:31.664
- Hiya.
- Beautiful.

01:31:32.699 --> 01:31:34.667
- Where's Max?
- He'll be here.

01:31:34.701 --> 01:31:38.104
You know, sometimes, I swear he does this
to be the center of attention.

01:31:38.138 --> 01:31:40.740
It's his party, hm?
Don't give him a hard time.

01:31:40.774 --> 01:31:42.742
Don't worry.

01:31:42.776 --> 01:31:44.443
I won't.

01:31:44.478 --> 01:31:46.479
It's like he never
even existed.

01:31:46.513 --> 01:31:48.247
- Who?
- Tony.

01:31:48.282 --> 01:31:50.283
What are you going on
about now?

01:31:50.317 --> 01:31:52.618
Those fucking slopes offed him
not two days ago,

01:31:52.653 --> 01:31:55.755
yet we're eating fucking rock
shrimp like it never happened.

01:31:55.789 --> 01:31:58.991
You heard Jimmy. We're gonna hit
back when the time is right.

01:31:59.026 --> 01:32:02.061
Yeah. I'm starting to have serious
doubts that time will come.

01:32:02.095 --> 01:32:03.863
What are you talking about?

01:32:04.698 --> 01:32:06.666
Have another drink,
it's a party.

01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:10.903
It's a party? When they put a bullet in
your head, I'll remember to say that.

01:32:10.938 --> 01:32:12.972
...two, three!

01:32:14.675 --> 01:32:15.708
(Laughs)

01:32:15.742 --> 01:32:18.244
How come you always end up
at the kids' table?

01:32:18.278 --> 01:32:21.047
Because we're having
a tea party.

01:32:21.081 --> 01:32:22.148
(Giggling)

01:32:22.182 --> 01:32:24.383
Well, perhaps we've had enough
tea for today.

01:32:24.418 --> 01:32:28.154
Hey, gang, this is
my beautiful wife Nancy.

01:32:29.056 --> 01:32:30.756
The love of my life.

01:32:30.791 --> 01:32:32.792
Okay, wait, I got a new game.

01:32:32.826 --> 01:32:35.728
Listen, three, two, one...

01:32:36.330 --> 01:32:38.030
- (Breaks wind)
- Ohh!

01:32:38.065 --> 01:32:40.066
Nancy, no!

01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:42.134
Corrupting the children,
Charlie?

01:32:45.305 --> 01:32:47.306
(Text alert)

01:32:56.683 --> 01:32:57.984
Dude.

01:32:59.786 --> 01:33:00.786
Dude.

01:33:00.821 --> 01:33:02.455
Good to see you, baby face.

01:33:02.489 --> 01:33:04.490
It's good to see you.

01:33:04.524 --> 01:33:06.559
You too.

01:33:09.529 --> 01:33:11.030
What's that for?

01:33:11.064 --> 01:33:13.099
I missed a birthday or two.

01:33:14.034 --> 01:33:15.301
Thanks.

01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:23.976
So, are you coming down or are you
gonna hide in your room?

01:33:25.846 --> 01:33:27.280
I just need a minute.

01:33:27.314 --> 01:33:29.348
Take your time.

01:33:32.653 --> 01:33:34.654
The room feels so big.

01:33:39.159 --> 01:33:41.127
How's Dad been?

01:33:41.161 --> 01:33:42.662
Good.

01:33:42.696 --> 01:33:44.730
Considering what's going on.

01:33:46.967 --> 01:33:48.501
He's happy you're back.

01:33:53.507 --> 01:33:55.541
What's the turnout like
down there?

01:33:55.575 --> 01:33:57.576
The usual posse.

01:33:57.611 --> 01:33:59.845
Don't worry,
I'll fend everybody off.

01:34:01.214 --> 01:34:03.215
Just try not to shiv
the relatives.

01:34:06.753 --> 01:34:07.787
Okay.

01:34:08.355 --> 01:34:09.955
Let's do this.

01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:12.124
Lieutenant,
I got something for you.

01:34:12.159 --> 01:34:13.326
Progress?

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.862
Like a shark, I drown if
I'm not always moving forward.

01:34:16.897 --> 01:34:18.297
What have you got?

01:34:18.332 --> 01:34:21.334
That license plate from the
drive-by on Jimmy Laszlo

01:34:21.368 --> 01:34:23.502
was registered to a grow house
in Tuxedo.

01:34:23.537 --> 01:34:25.304
I thought that house
was a non-starter.

01:34:25.339 --> 01:34:28.474
Well, it turns out it's a Clay Street
operation, the Lee brothers.

01:34:29.242 --> 01:34:32.445
The hoisin sauce at the Tony
Aldon murder-- it kinda fits.

01:34:32.846 --> 01:34:35.414
The Lee brothers are making
a play for the docks.

01:34:35.449 --> 01:34:37.683
Well, you know. They take out Tony Aldon,
they aim a shot at Jimmy Laszlo.

01:34:37.718 --> 01:34:41.721
According to my CI, the boys are playing war
out the back of the family restaurant--

01:34:41.755 --> 01:34:44.724
The Bamboo Pearl on Frank--

01:34:44.758 --> 01:34:46.192
Who's the CI?

01:34:47.194 --> 01:34:49.562
237. Prefers to remain
anonymous.

01:34:51.064 --> 01:34:53.065
Start writing the warrant.

01:34:53.367 --> 01:34:55.067
(Cheering)

01:34:55.068 --> 01:34:56.068
Maxie!

01:34:57.404 --> 01:34:59.205
Maxie!

01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:03.843
Maxie!

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.854
- Over here.
- Thanks.

01:35:15.922 --> 01:35:17.323
Now...

01:35:21.762 --> 01:35:23.362
Welcome back, Max.

01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:28.334
(Siren wails)

01:35:38.211 --> 01:35:39.578
Hey, everybody.

01:35:39.613 --> 01:35:41.480
Excuse me. Excuse me!

01:35:41.515 --> 01:35:44.216
Oakland Police. I have a warrant
to search the premises.

01:35:44.251 --> 01:35:45.885
You can't just charge in here.

01:35:45.919 --> 01:35:47.553
- I can do whatever I want.
- Hey, hey, hey! - Hey, back off!

01:35:47.587 --> 01:35:49.188
Don and Tony Lee,
where are they?

01:35:49.222 --> 01:35:51.223
Oakland Police.
We have a warrant.

01:35:51.258 --> 01:35:53.859
Mrs. Lee, my condolences.
Here's your warrant.

01:35:53.894 --> 01:35:55.928
Paul and Donny Lee,
are you home?

01:35:58.064 --> 01:36:02.101
Attention, please, this is Oakland Police.
Nobody is to leave the premises.

01:36:02.135 --> 01:36:04.370
Officers will take
your information.

01:36:19.553 --> 01:36:21.554
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:28.461
Mom still at the store?

01:36:36.036 --> 01:36:38.003
She's not coming, is she?

01:36:38.038 --> 01:36:39.572
Evie, sweetheart. Come here.

01:36:39.606 --> 01:36:41.640
- Don't.
- Hey.

01:36:41.641 --> 01:36:42.641
Don't.

01:36:46.146 --> 01:36:47.446
(Sighs)

01:37:16.543 --> 01:37:18.544
(Rings door bell)

01:37:23.783 --> 01:37:25.751
You must be Jackie.

01:37:25.785 --> 01:37:27.820
And you must be Max.

01:37:30.457 --> 01:37:32.224
I've heard a lot about you.

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.227
Only good things, I hope?

01:37:36.396 --> 01:37:39.198
Well, they certainly
didn't tell me everything.

01:37:40.834 --> 01:37:42.067
Watch out.

01:37:42.102 --> 01:37:45.404
I'll tell your father you're
flirting with his employees.

01:37:46.406 --> 01:37:49.108
Who is he gonna believe,
me or you?

01:37:52.479 --> 01:37:55.214
I heard you got picked up
a few months ago.

01:37:55.248 --> 01:37:56.882
Uh-huh.

01:37:56.917 --> 01:37:58.951
And now you're back.

01:38:01.688 --> 01:38:03.689
I hear you went away too.

01:38:04.424 --> 01:38:05.925
Uh-huh.

01:38:08.495 --> 01:38:10.029
Welcome home.

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:38.624
Thank you.

01:39:01.381 --> 01:39:03.349
- Jackie.
- Nancy.

01:39:03.383 --> 01:39:05.417
Charlie's wife.

01:39:05.986 --> 01:39:07.753
You look beautiful.

01:39:07.787 --> 01:39:09.221
Oh, please.

01:39:09.255 --> 01:39:11.724
- No, really.
- Well, thank you.

01:39:11.758 --> 01:39:14.159
What is she doing here?
She doesn't even know Max.

01:39:16.329 --> 01:39:18.864
But she's getting awfully cozy
awfully fast.

01:39:24.871 --> 01:39:26.338
I don't recognize you.

01:39:26.373 --> 01:39:28.374
I'm a work associate
of Jimmy's.

01:39:28.408 --> 01:39:31.210
But I've never been to
a private function before.

01:39:31.244 --> 01:39:34.446
I guess I'm moving up
in his estimations, right?

01:39:34.481 --> 01:39:35.681
(Nancy chuckles)

01:39:35.715 --> 01:39:37.282
He's a good man.

01:39:38.752 --> 01:39:39.918
Welcome.

01:39:39.953 --> 01:39:41.720
Thank you.

01:39:41.755 --> 01:39:43.789
- Need a refill?
- No, no, I'm good.

01:39:45.225 --> 01:39:48.160
- Where's the lady's room?
- Just down the hall.

01:40:00.373 --> 01:40:01.740
(Snorts)

01:40:01.775 --> 01:40:03.509
Oh, sorry.

01:40:03.543 --> 01:40:05.310
- Get in here.
- It's okay.

01:40:05.345 --> 01:40:06.812
Jackie.

01:40:07.614 --> 01:40:09.415
Get in here, now.

01:40:09.449 --> 01:40:11.483
Close the door.

01:40:14.187 --> 01:40:15.888
You're just in time.

01:40:34.474 --> 01:40:35.774
How was that?

01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:39.712
Just what I needed.

01:40:51.558 --> 01:40:53.225
You having fun, hm?

01:40:53.259 --> 01:40:55.260
What the fuck am I doing here?

01:40:55.295 --> 01:40:57.296
I invited you.

01:40:57.330 --> 01:40:59.331
What's going on there?

01:40:59.365 --> 01:41:01.366
It's Jackie Hays.

01:41:01.901 --> 01:41:03.869
Not too shabby, huh?

01:41:03.903 --> 01:41:05.904
You trust her?

01:41:05.939 --> 01:41:07.706
Dad seems to.

01:41:07.741 --> 01:41:09.742
She's bringing in
good business.

01:41:09.776 --> 01:41:11.810
I'm glad you've come.

01:41:13.513 --> 01:41:15.147
I didn't have a choice.

01:41:15.181 --> 01:41:17.349
She's obviously got
a thing for Pops.

01:41:18.551 --> 01:41:21.220
Good. He deserves it.

01:41:23.423 --> 01:41:25.824
Meet me out back
in two minutes.

01:41:25.859 --> 01:41:27.593
Why?

01:41:28.261 --> 01:41:30.262
Two minutes.

01:41:32.265 --> 01:41:34.399
Chop suey? Give me a break.

01:41:34.434 --> 01:41:36.568
Chop suey's as American
as apple pie.

01:41:36.603 --> 01:41:38.904
You go to Hong Kong
and try and order chop suey.

01:41:38.938 --> 01:41:40.806
Might as well ask
for a cheeseburger.

01:41:44.444 --> 01:41:45.644
Shit!

01:41:45.678 --> 01:41:47.713
(Screaming and shouting)

01:41:49.415 --> 01:41:50.916
Stop, police!

01:41:54.921 --> 01:41:57.122
Everybody, get out. Shit!

01:41:57.157 --> 01:41:58.257
Wilson!

01:41:58.291 --> 01:41:59.725
Everybody, out the building!

01:42:01.995 --> 01:42:03.295
Fuck, fuck!

01:42:04.330 --> 01:42:06.165
- Fleming!
- Come on!

01:42:07.066 --> 01:42:08.367
Help!

01:42:08.401 --> 01:42:09.935
Back here!

01:42:12.972 --> 01:42:14.940
Finally, some peace and quiet.

01:42:14.974 --> 01:42:17.009
Why did you want me here, Jimmy?

01:42:27.754 --> 01:42:30.222
You wanna find your son's
killer, don't you?

01:42:34.594 --> 01:42:36.028
You were right.

01:42:38.131 --> 01:42:40.465
FLEMING: Don't worry.
You'll be okay.

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.334
About what?

01:42:42.969 --> 01:42:44.803
I have a traitor in there.

01:42:53.313 --> 01:42:54.847
Who?

01:42:56.583 --> 01:42:58.584
I don't know.

01:42:59.118 --> 01:43:01.119
But you're gonna help me
find them.

01:43:19.422 --> 01:43:25.707
