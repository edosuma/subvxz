00:01.280 --> 00:03.320
Previously:

00:03.320 --> 00:04.600
I can't waste
six years

00:04.600 --> 00:06.960
before getting into
the P.A. programme.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.560
I'll try speeding
things along.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.280
Forget it. I quit.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.720
You're John Doe.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.080
You lived on
our psych ward.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.680
The memoirs
are going great.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.200
I found you
a steno.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.040
Meet John Doe.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.920
Writing about
my life's a snore,

00:21.920 --> 00:23.360
even to me.

00:23.360 --> 00:24.720
I'm wasting my time.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.160
You keep shovelling
this trash,

00:26.160 --> 00:28.040
we'll have
a best seller.

00:28.040 --> 00:32.040
Write this. "Her shapely legs
straddled my gurney."

02:30.040 --> 02:34.040
Remember when I said
I would kill you last?

02:34.080 --> 02:38.080
I lied.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.800
Sunday, bloody Sunday.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.240
Griffin, you done?

02:50.240 --> 02:52.160
What you got, Nanette?

02:52.160 --> 02:53.600
A splitting
headache.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.480
He's got severe
abdominal pain.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.920
It's a hernia.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.320
Lifting luggage
out of me truck

02:59.320 --> 03:00.760
at the bus station.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.200
Bang! Like a blow out.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.440
I'm Dr Griffin.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.520
Call for
a surgical consult.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.480
Let me help you,
Mr...

03:08.480 --> 03:11.240
McGroyn. Me friends
call me Pat.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.280
Chauffeur?

03:12.280 --> 03:13.400
Cabbie.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.800
Pretty spiffy clothes
for a hack.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.720
You saw
my play then?

03:17.720 --> 03:19.160
Comedian, too, huh?

03:19.160 --> 03:20.600
The new municipal code

03:20.600 --> 03:23.000
says that
"wherefore and to wit,

03:23.000 --> 03:24.920
"taxi drivers
must look presentable

03:24.920 --> 03:26.680
"while configured
for operation."

03:26.680 --> 03:29.120
Trying to
clean up the city?

03:29.120 --> 03:31.600
Sure, cabbie's outfits kept
millions away.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.600
We have half the necessary street
signs, and the mayor's up in arms
about my short sleeves.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.040
The resident on call's
in surgery.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.760
No luck pushing
the hernia back
into the abdomen.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.200
Let's wheel him
to O.R.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.800
No, no, Nanette.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.240
I just want to try
one more thing.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.480
Can't get no taction, satis.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.560
Ah!

03:52.560 --> 03:55.320
Hey! That's OK, doc.
That's OK.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.680
How'd you do that?

03:56.680 --> 03:59.520
I was
a faith healer.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.960
By extruding the bowel,
I was able to pop it back

04:02.960 --> 04:04.320
through
the muscle hole.

04:04.320 --> 04:08.160
Have that hernia
taken care of
as soon as possible.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.080
While I'm here,
let's operate.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.480
Wait a minute, doctor.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.280
I got something for you.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.800
Here.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.079
Here.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.720
Write me off
on your income tax.

04:18.720 --> 04:22.720
Thanks.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.800
Dad?

04:27.800 --> 04:31.080
Down here.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.160
I was going to
do the ironing.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.440
I was going to
do the ironing.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.920
Chemistry!

04:34.920 --> 04:37.600
Why do they make
poli-sci majors
study useless junk?

04:37.600 --> 04:40.080
A liberal arts
education

04:40.080 --> 04:43.840
gives students
a well-balanced view
of the universe.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.440
Anyway, we have to calculate
the solubility-something

04:47.440 --> 04:49.000
of something
in something,

04:49.000 --> 04:50.720
and I'm totally
under water.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.360
You had to learn
this stuff, right?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.000
Sure.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.120
Sure.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.240
OK.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.920
Sodium borate.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.600
Dad, you always leave
whites in with colours.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.080
Look at
my underwear. Blue.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.400
Whew!

05:05.400 --> 05:07.480
From now on, let me handle
the wash.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.240
Oh, my socks, too?

05:09.240 --> 05:11.960
Solubility products.
Yeah, OK, well...

05:11.960 --> 05:13.600
I thought you had
to learn that stuff

05:13.600 --> 05:17.000
to be a doctor.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.800
Don't you have
anything else to do

05:18.800 --> 05:19.840
on a weekend night?

05:19.840 --> 05:22.120
You used to
want me to study.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.040
Since you transferred
from Vassar,

05:24.040 --> 05:26.440
all you've done
is attend class

05:26.440 --> 05:29.520
and take care
of Tommy and me.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.240
Go out to a movie or social.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.280
Dad, socials disappeared
with poodle skirts.

05:34.280 --> 05:38.080
You and Rick had
a good relationship.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.200
You put that on hold.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.320
We want our freedom.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.760
So use it.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.640
With Carol, you're getting more
action than me.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.720
Lizzie.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.560
Listen, we said we'd stay off
each other's case.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.080
So stay off, OK?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.520
Let me know

05:55.520 --> 05:59.520
if you have a breakthrough
in chem.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.440
Hey!

06:02.440 --> 06:06.440
Oh, sorry. Habit.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.600
(TAPE RECORDER) 'The body yields
to my knife,

06:17.600 --> 06:20.920
'submits to
the hand, still...

06:20.920 --> 06:24.800
'the flesh,
pink and moist.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.200
'Her lips pressed
against mine,

06:27.200 --> 06:29.600
'body quivering,
aching,

06:29.600 --> 06:33.600
'and I felt
myself stir.'

06:35.800 --> 06:38.680
Chapter 10,
the summer vacation.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.080
She came in
from the garden,

06:41.080 --> 06:44.000
cheeks flushed,
arms filled with flowers.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
I sat,
playing the Wurlitzer.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.200
She said wistfully,

06:50.200 --> 06:52.080
"Where would
you like these?"

06:52.080 --> 06:53.560
I smiled.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.400
"Put roses on the piano
and tulips on the organ."

06:57.400 --> 06:58.800
KNOCK ON THE DOOR

06:58.800 --> 07:00.080
Morning.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.040
Working on your book?
Or magic tricks?

07:03.040 --> 07:05.400
My old
Harry Houdini kit,

07:05.400 --> 07:06.800
excellent
physical therapy.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.160
See?
Fine motor control
finally returning.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.920
I'm happy
for you, but...

07:11.920 --> 07:13.320
Pick a card.

07:13.320 --> 07:17.160
We agreed
instead of writing
a boring medical memoir,

07:17.160 --> 07:20.000
you'd turn this
into a pulp classic.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.600
Don't worry. Look at the card.
Put it there.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.160
It won't be
long now, Doe.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.400
I'll be back
in O.R. one

07:27.400 --> 07:30.000
performing feats
of legerdemain.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.320
Here we go.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.360
Ta-da!

07:32.360 --> 07:35.920
Wrong.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.360
Five of spade?

07:37.360 --> 07:38.880
Mm-mmm.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.480
Four of hearts?

07:40.480 --> 07:41.880
What about the novel?

07:41.880 --> 07:43.360
It'll be a best seller.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.280
Not if we don't finish.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.200
Stop playing
these stupid... No!

07:47.200 --> 07:50.080
Stop playing
these stupid games
and buckle down.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.520
OK. You're
probably right.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.920
I'll type what you've
already dictated.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.240
You think about
what happens to
Constance the daughter

07:57.240 --> 07:59.400
after the Lingus
family reunion.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.160
OK.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.560
Meanwhile, I'll practice
my handkerchief chain.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.560
Oh, for
crying out loud!

08:31.560 --> 08:33.000
Jackie, how's
Mr McGroyn?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.440
Surgery was simple

08:34.440 --> 08:36.679
after your great job in E.R.

08:36.679 --> 08:39.559
Nah. I've been meaning
to talk to you.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.000
You've been
so crossed-up

08:41.000 --> 08:42.919
about your marriage
going south.

08:42.919 --> 08:46.280
For what it's worth,
your ex is a bonehead.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.640
Maybe you should see
his new girlfriend
before judging.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.040
She couldn't be
prettier than you.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.920
Tell me that again
10 pounds from now.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.920
We should pay
Bobby boy back
with interest.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.160
Are you coming on
to me?

09:03.160 --> 09:06.320
No, no.
I didn't mean that.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.240
Look. I was also
in a long-term
relationship.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.560
Seven years.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.840
Hometown sweethearts.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.040
You know,
the whole movie.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.200
Ballerina.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.640
True love?

09:16.640 --> 09:20.640
She dumped me for
a guy in pink tights

09:21.280 --> 09:23.680
just before
I came to Boston.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.080
10-4, the end.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.520
It's like suddenly

09:26.520 --> 09:30.520
this major part of
my life, just boom.

09:31.320 --> 09:35.320
I just thought we
could commiserate.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.200
I don't hit
on women that way.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.040
People think
it's open season

09:40.040 --> 09:41.480
once the ring's off.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.760
I'm just not ready.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.680
Tell me about it.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.520
But I guess we're going
to have to start dating,

09:49.520 --> 09:50.960
I mean, sometime.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.360
You can't
be alone forever.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.280
Back to
the singles scene.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.720
How many people

09:56.720 --> 09:59.600
can you tell
your life story to?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.080
What I really wish

10:01.080 --> 10:03.360
is to step into
a relationship

10:03.360 --> 10:07.280
with the right woman.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.600
Anyway, you've got
a friend.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.600
Carole King.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.920
Bag lady
hit her head
on the concrete.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.880
Knocked unconscious.
Vitals are stable.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.680
Shh! Nigger!

10:30.680 --> 10:33.680
Love the people you meet
in public service.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.080
Put her here.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.240
I want to go to the mission
and see my friends. Nigger!

10:38.240 --> 10:41.080
Was cursing
like that around
south station

10:41.080 --> 10:42.520
until someone
decked her.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.960
I didn't mean it.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.520
Mind if
I stock up?

10:45.520 --> 10:46.840
Go ahead.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.240
You like being
a paramedic full-time?

10:49.240 --> 10:50.360
Something to do.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.280
Don't miss
being an orderly.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.240
Starting to get
cold outside.

10:54.240 --> 10:58.080
I like the coat they gave me
at the mission.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.040
Aah!

10:59.040 --> 11:00.480
Aah!

11:00.480 --> 11:04.480
What about your becoming
a physician assistant?

11:04.520 --> 11:06.920
Stupid idea in
the first place.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.360
Get a skull series,

11:08.360 --> 11:10.480
and admit her
for observation.

11:10.480 --> 11:11.680
Nigger!

11:11.680 --> 11:15.560
And have her fit
for a muzzle.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.880
Hup!

11:16.880 --> 11:18.960
You agree with me?

11:18.960 --> 11:20.520
Daniel...

11:20.520 --> 11:22.200
It's a perfect
financial solution.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.800
If we do this, the insurance company
will cut our rates.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.800
I just don't feel right
about drug-testing the whole staff.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.560
Everybody will be tested.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.120
I'll submit to the
first urinalysis,

11:33.120 --> 11:35.840
even if I have to
stand there all day.

11:35.840 --> 11:39.640
All right. If you think
that's the only way.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.520
I'll set things
in motion.

11:41.520 --> 11:45.520
INTERCOM BUZZES

11:46.480 --> 11:48.360
Yes?

11:48.360 --> 11:50.760
Nonsense.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.760
I wonder if my chemo
will be flagged?

11:54.760 --> 11:57.480
Holy Moses!

11:57.480 --> 11:59.880
What do you think
you're doing?

11:59.880 --> 12:02.280
About a floor
every three minutes.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.720
This place is filthy.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.160
Come inside
immediately.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.080
Look at
the dust here.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.360
Please be careful.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.640
(SNEEZES)

12:09.640 --> 12:10.920
Gesundheit!

12:10.920 --> 12:12.040
Thanks.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.480
You've gone far enough.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.920
Come in this window.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.160
Aah!

12:17.160 --> 12:21.160
Oh, my God.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.600
Did you see it?

12:27.600 --> 12:31.160
Is he all right?

12:31.160 --> 12:35.160
Excuse me. Sir?
Can you hear me, sir?

12:37.280 --> 12:39.200
Don't move.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.080
Don't worry.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.920
Look out.
Watch your backs.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.800
Excuse me. Out of the way, please.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.840
I phoned for
the paramedics.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.280
Let's start a line.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.600
Normal saline at 150,
and get a BP carefully.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.720
Do something.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.680
We're not equipped
to move a spinal fracture.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.600
Paramedics are
trained for this.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.200
Outside a hospital
and can't get help?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.640
I need a stethoscope.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.960
Fell right before my eyes.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.360
Horrifying
not being able to help.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.520
He could have
been street pizza.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.920
Chest sounds OK.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.600
There don't appear
to be fractures.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.680
Can you wiggle your toes?

13:18.680 --> 13:19.960
Good.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.960
Over halfway to the top.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.920
Excuse me.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.080
Excuse me.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.040
Luther.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.480
Luther.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.880
Nothing yet. He fell
three stories.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.320
What's in the IV?

13:35.320 --> 13:36.440
Saline, 150.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.120
Cervical collar,
backboard and sandbags. Excuse me.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.520
You'll be all right.
Just relax.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.400
We'll be real gentle.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.040
Easy, guys.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.760
Get the backboard
under him.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.760
Turning...

13:53.080 --> 13:54.800
Quite a crowd.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.720
Lust for violence
is insatiable.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.720
One, two, three.

14:03.440 --> 14:07.440
Out of the way, folks.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.160
We'll roll him
around to E.R.

14:10.160 --> 14:14.160
Then you and I
need to talk.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.520
Again?

14:32.920 --> 14:35.320
I've lost
all my friends.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.880
I didn't know
you had any.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.280
This place
takes over our lives.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.200
I had a free evening

14:42.200 --> 14:44.120
and went to
Jonathan Swift's.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.840
Wheatstraw was playing.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.400
Sounds like fun, huh?

14:47.400 --> 14:49.640
Yeah. I fell asleep.
Cream, please.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.600
At least you've
got Westphall.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.200
I don't have time
to meet people.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.240
When I leave, I'm
looking for my teddy.

14:57.240 --> 15:00.520
No exercise,
bad food, stress.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.800
You still play
with Turner's tush.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.680
Knee-slapper.
Your sex life started sliding

15:05.680 --> 15:08.080
since the gift shop
dropped Playboy.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.200
That's right.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.880
On top of this place
ruining our social lives,

15:11.880 --> 15:13.720
the conservatives are clamping down.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.280
Yeah. That supreme court thing,

15:15.280 --> 15:16.840
sodomy ruling.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.400
Sounds like the Middle Ages.

15:18.400 --> 15:22.400
Those things
should be regulated.

15:22.440 --> 15:25.360
Excuse me.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.000
Nice going, Carol.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.360
Jack's still sensitive.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.920
I can understand that.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.480
You brought it up.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.520
Hi, everybody.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.960
It's the new hero
of E.R.,

15:34.960 --> 15:37.040
Dr Snap, Crackle And Pop.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.400
Excuse me. I'm going.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.120
Nice. What does
Westphall do
with all that?

15:43.120 --> 15:46.000
Private practice
is the road to sanity.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.040
Hospital work
is too demanding.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.240
For what?

15:49.240 --> 15:53.240
Life. Love.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.400
You need time
for a relationship?

15:55.400 --> 15:57.920
Not into relationships,
just receptacles.

15:57.920 --> 16:01.920
Oh.

16:10.280 --> 16:13.360
Helen, can I get
my old chair back?

16:13.360 --> 16:17.360
I'll see what I can do.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.880
Hi, Helen. I thought
I'd surprise Mark,

16:23.880 --> 16:25.320
take him to lunch.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.440
His new office
is 3309.

16:27.440 --> 16:31.440
OK. Thanks.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.680
Listen, you bubblehead,
I'm the chief of surgery.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.080
When I say
clear the board,

16:43.080 --> 16:47.080
I mean get out the mop!
Understood?

16:49.280 --> 16:50.320
What?

16:50.320 --> 16:52.960
Honey, I just came
to take you out...

16:52.960 --> 16:56.680
Ellen, I could've been in the
middle of something important.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.120
You sound a lot like Mark.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.520
Oh, from working on his book.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.440
I've grown to admire
and emulate him,

17:05.440 --> 17:08.119
someone to model
my own life after.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.599
You're the typist.

17:09.599 --> 17:10.920
John Doe number six.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.319
Oh, excuse me.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.960
Mark said
this was therapy.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.599
He's got
such will power.

17:17.599 --> 17:19.040
He's so committed.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.520
Not, you know, committed.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.400
Please sit down.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.280
Yes. He's quite a man, all right.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.920
You have to respect him.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.520
Respect. I like respect.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.840
How did he get it?

17:32.840 --> 17:35.320
One of the keys to Mark's success
is his selfishness.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.720
He sees an opportunity
and takes hold,

17:37.720 --> 17:40.080
regardless of other
people's feelings.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.560
Selfishness.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.080
Mm-hmm.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.280
He has that
binary world view

17:45.280 --> 17:47.160
that very successful
people have.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.080
There's his way
and the wrong way.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.920
He also has
a brash confidence

17:52.920 --> 17:54.880
bordering on conceit.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.320
Confidence.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.560
Mark is explosive,

17:57.560 --> 17:59.920
but ultimately has
a stable personality.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.560
An amazing man.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.440
Performing mitral valve
commisurotomies at 25,

18:04.440 --> 18:07.480
heart by-passes just
a couple of years later,

18:07.480 --> 18:09.800
Boston Brahmin, rich past.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.640
He knows where he's from.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.640
Is there anything more
I should learn about him?

18:15.720 --> 18:18.040
Well, he's picky.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.920
He can
tell the difference

18:19.920 --> 18:23.080
between medium and light starch
at a glance.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.680
He's a good singer.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.800
# When I was 21... #

18:26.800 --> 18:28.200
Only he never sings.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.520
Oh.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.480
He's can be aggravating...

18:31.480 --> 18:32.600
You nincompoop!

18:32.600 --> 18:34.160
..thoughtless...

18:34.160 --> 18:35.480
Do the wash, lady.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.760
..sweet man.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.000
Yeah.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
Well, Ellen, for what
it's worth, I love you.

18:43.720 --> 18:47.600
And he's much smaller
than you are.

18:47.600 --> 18:51.600
Time to go.

18:57.840 --> 19:01.840
Luther, all that excitement
made me thirsty.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.720
Thanks. Never saw you
in action. Fine job.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.000
Thanks.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.440
Enjoy the work?

19:09.440 --> 19:10.960
I can take care of people.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.680
You can't perform
clinical work

19:13.680 --> 19:16.280
without joining the physician's
assistant programme.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.640
I was wrong to encourage you.
I apologise.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.520
I'm trained.
I wasn't hurting anyone.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.200
I need four years
of college

19:24.200 --> 19:26.800
before I can do anything
but buff bedpans.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.400
I'm trying to
speed things along.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.440
I'm tired of bureaucracy.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.640
You said this hospital
was important to you.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.920
You wanted
to help people here.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.800
Everyone put
the kibosh on that.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.960
Patience is also an important
aspect of medicine.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.840
Easy for you to say.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.680
We all mortgaged
our personal lives
to become doctors.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.080
Look at someone
like Jack Morrison.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.480
He studied amid
squalor in Mexico

19:52.480 --> 19:54.880
in order to
fulfil his dreams.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.760
Dr Morrison has nothing
to do with me.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.080
I'm talking about
helping the sick.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.560
If you're not
committed to that,

20:02.560 --> 20:06.560
perhaps you
were wise to quit.

20:06.880 --> 20:10.880
Woo! &gt;

20:14.640 --> 20:17.040
Shh! Nigger.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.120
Nigger. Nigger.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.640
Don't say that around me.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.720
Why do you say that?

20:21.720 --> 20:23.240
What? Nigger.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.280
That word.

20:24.280 --> 20:27.720
You're saying it
to Nurse Rosenthal. She's white.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.920
I just talk.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.920
It's one of my words.

20:33.240 --> 20:37.240
Hoo!

20:38.200 --> 20:42.200
Shh!

20:44.760 --> 20:46.680
Lizzie, this
is a surprise.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.120
I'm getting
a prescription.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.040
You've been here
two days?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.400
You look
better than I do

20:52.400 --> 20:55.120
after a night's sleep.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.200
It's like chicken.
People want extra breast,

20:57.200 --> 20:58.680
not double portions
of thighs.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.080
I think
you're beautiful.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.480
Hope some guy does.

21:01.480 --> 21:04.400
I'm having my birth control
pills renewed.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.280
I'm getting back on them
just in case.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.720
I don't like diaphragms,

21:08.720 --> 21:11.600
and condoms
just don't feel right.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.000
IUDs are almost
off the market.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.920
Well, depends
on the woman.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.360
This is wild.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.280
We're on the same pill.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.720
Charge it to Westphall.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.160
I have cash.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.040
Dad's happier since you two
started going out.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.360
I knew something was up
after the doctor's awards.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.280
Where do you guys go?

21:30.280 --> 21:33.160
You never spend the night
at our place.

21:33.160 --> 21:37.160
Living with your mom,
yours is out of the question.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.360
Lizzie, I'm uncomfortable
talking to you about this.

21:40.360 --> 21:44.240
I forget.
The older generation
is so out of touch.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.680
See you later.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.080
See you later.

21:47.080 --> 21:51.080
Lizzie, you've got mine.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.280
Mark, how you doing?

21:55.280 --> 21:56.680
It's a sweet life.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.480
La dolce vita.
Saw the picture again.

22:00.480 --> 22:01.920
Fellini's a master.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.840
If I want to read subtitles,
I'll go to the library.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.280
How's your book
progressing?

22:06.280 --> 22:07.680
Coming down
the home stretch.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.080
Chapter 23 - anti-arrhythmic
therapy

22:10.080 --> 22:12.040
for ventricular
tachycardia.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.120
Watch this.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.400
There you are.
Hello, Ellen.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.280
Daniel. What's happening
in your office?  Why?

22:18.280 --> 22:21.640
I had the silliest
conversation with that John.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.520
It's red leather,
well-worn.

22:23.520 --> 22:27.520
If you see his chair,
let me know.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.680
Jack, could you
finish signing

22:30.680 --> 22:33.600
the med request forms
on Mrs Thai?

22:33.600 --> 22:34.640
I'm busy.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.480
Could you do it later?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.480
Otherwise, we can't
give her the Keflex.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.960
It's stupid paperwork!

22:40.960 --> 22:42.760
It's demeaning!
It's not medicine!

22:42.760 --> 22:46.760
Jack, none of us
likes to do it.

22:47.480 --> 22:51.480
I hate this hospital.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.400
Dr Fiscus, do you know
the foul mouth,

23:00.400 --> 23:02.800
Polly Miller,
who hit her head?

23:02.800 --> 23:03.760
Why?

23:03.760 --> 23:06.160
Why?

23:06.160 --> 23:09.000
Skull series returned
negative on a concussion.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.480
Tomorrow
I'll release her.

23:10.480 --> 23:14.480
Another nut
on the street.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.160
Mr Stritch,
you're a lucky man.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.600
All clear?

23:19.600 --> 23:21.000
Not a scratch.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.960
The car
broke your fall.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.880
I'm holding you
for observation.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.760
We found a little blood
in the urine.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.200
How's the patient?

23:29.200 --> 23:30.600
Intact.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.560
Let's take him
to psych.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.960
Wait. Why?

23:33.960 --> 23:36.000
You're crazy trying that stunt.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.120
That's why I'm
starting out small.

23:38.120 --> 23:41.960
See, I'm working my way
up to the big stuff

23:41.960 --> 23:44.360
like the Pru,
the Hancock Tower.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.240
At lunch, I look
for chimneys, walls,

23:47.240 --> 23:48.840
to practice climbing.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.640
Facades hold interesting handholds.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.720
Or lack of them.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.800
My concentration was broken,

23:54.800 --> 23:56.360
so I grabbed a bad brick.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.800
You know, it's funny

23:57.800 --> 24:00.200
cos I go
to escape distractions,

24:00.200 --> 24:02.280
leave behind
the daily circus.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.720
What do you do?

24:03.720 --> 24:05.640
Sell life insurance.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.560
You're both 43 and change.

24:07.560 --> 24:10.520
Actuarially speaking -
years left to live.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.320
Me, I'm a 40 even.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.000
So?

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
Most people hedge their bets with
whole life, term or universal.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.600
I've got a special on universal.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.840
People never
use the freedom
life insurance gives

24:26.840 --> 24:29.760
to conquer new heights,
go for broke.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.200
That's silly.

24:31.200 --> 24:35.200
No, no.
Let me show you.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.240
Hey! Hey, wait!

24:38.240 --> 24:39.680
Uh, Mr Stritch.

24:39.680 --> 24:43.680
Come on!

24:44.960 --> 24:46.840
You're on
a country road,

24:46.840 --> 24:48.760
no cars for miles.

24:48.760 --> 24:52.600
Suddenly, a jack rabbit
runs in front of the car.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.480
Why did he wait?

24:55.480 --> 24:59.360
Cos there's nothing like
the adrenaline-high you get

24:59.360 --> 25:03.160
when you beat those wheels.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.080
If you don't...
hasenpfeffer.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.000
Must take plenty
of courage.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.960
Courage, ha!

25:08.960 --> 25:12.960
I do this for myself.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.840
It takes bigger
stundeens to get married

25:21.840 --> 25:24.160
than to hang
off buildings.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.720
Would you get off?

25:25.720 --> 25:27.240
He's right.

25:27.240 --> 25:30.000
Later, when you release me,
I'll try again.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.440
Only this time...

25:31.440 --> 25:35.440
up to the roof.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.400
Coming through.

25:49.200 --> 25:53.200
Thanks.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.760
Hi.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.760
Hi.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.920
My name's Seth.
What's yours?

26:12.920 --> 26:14.560
Liz.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.360
Hi.

26:16.360 --> 26:20.360
Hi.

26:39.880 --> 26:43.360
Oh, I can't sleep.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.280
Sorry. I'm being
as quiet as I can.

26:46.280 --> 26:50.280
You're not the problem.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.960
I've got
a guilty conscience.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.800
I yelled at Rosenthal
for no reason.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.720
I know.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.480
How could you?

27:00.480 --> 27:02.400
You were in the stairwell.

27:02.400 --> 27:05.760
Everybody from psych to the
boiler room got an earful.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.680
I don't know what's wrong.

27:07.680 --> 27:11.680
I'm snapping at my wife, too.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.760
I hate this place.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.920
Dr Morrison. Chandler.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.840
I'm going for a walk.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.280
OK.

27:21.280 --> 27:25.120
Could you look at
one of Dr Fiscus' patients?

27:25.120 --> 27:29.120
Nope. Fiscus can take care
of own his patients.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.840
That's what everybody says.

27:30.840 --> 27:34.680
I got a hot date with a very hot
ob-gyn.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.600
Something's wrong
with this lady.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.080
The hospital's
the best place for her.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.320
I won't give you advice,

27:41.320 --> 27:43.480
but if you want
to play doctor,

27:43.480 --> 27:46.640
you make a diagnosis,
back it up with facts.

27:46.640 --> 27:50.640
Besides, you don't work
here anymore, remember?

27:54.080 --> 27:56.480
What the hell did you say to my wife?

27:56.480 --> 27:58.760
Don't touch me - I'm sterile!

27:58.760 --> 28:00.240
I'll sterilize you, pal!

28:00.240 --> 28:02.920
You're making a mistake.
I boxed in college.

28:02.920 --> 28:03.560
Like hell, you did.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.360
Like hell, you did.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.160
I have the bad hand! See?

28:08.160 --> 28:09.480
Mm.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.960
Oh, boy.
You've really lost your mind.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.000
Oh, boy.
You've really lost your mind.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.400
but I got to
get back to my book.

28:15.400 --> 28:19.120
Chapter 15...
"A Tale Of Two Cysts."

28:19.120 --> 28:20.360
That wasn't me.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.520
This is me.

28:21.520 --> 28:24.160
Doe, take this down -
you're fired!

28:24.160 --> 28:27.000
You have one hour
to finish typing my manuscript.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
And you leave it right here!

28:32.440 --> 28:33.920
And disappear.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.360
Understand?

28:35.360 --> 28:36.920
Look...

28:36.920 --> 28:40.120
I've been working on my magic.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.440
For you.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.000
One hour, Doe.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
One hour.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.160
(DR CRAIG ON RECORDING)
'Charlie led the nurse...'

29:00.160 --> 29:01.560
(DR CRAIG ON RECORDING)
'Charlie led the nurse...'

29:01.560 --> 29:04.200
'..into the dark
operating theatre.

29:04.200 --> 29:08.200
'Here, at the scene of his greatest
of surgical triumphs, the gifted...'

29:21.360 --> 29:24.600
Aha!

29:24.600 --> 29:25.800
I told Butz and Fukuda,

29:25.800 --> 29:28.520
if they were doing to have reefer
parties at night,

29:28.520 --> 29:29.880
not to have them in here.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.560
I figured they hadn't listened.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.360
They've never listened before.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.000
What are you doing
in Dr Auschlander's office?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.160
Who're you, the FBI?

29:39.160 --> 29:40.640
No, I'm bigger than you are.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.040
For your information,
I don't answer people

29:43.040 --> 29:45.040
who go around,
breaking into lockers,

29:45.040 --> 29:47.000
and removing their personal items,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.240
and throwing them
all over the dirty linoleum.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.640
Anybody who does that
doesn't deserve to exist.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.000
Look, I was riled.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.400
Don't exist.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.120
All right, you acted like you were
better than me, so I got mad.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.480
Could've sworn I heard something,
but nobody else is here.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.040
OK, well, "nobody" is going
to crush your windpipe.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.400
Now what are you doing here?

30:04.400 --> 30:07.160
(CHOKED) You know the bag lady on
the third floor ward?

30:07.160 --> 30:09.080
The one that makes
all the strange noises?

30:09.080 --> 30:10.560
Yeah. Crackers Polly?

30:10.560 --> 30:13.720
Those noises sound like
comments about my complexion.

30:13.720 --> 30:17.120
Well, words don't mean anything
by themselves, you see,

30:17.120 --> 30:21.120
but if they're aimed at something,
then they mean something.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.280
She's not speaking them to anyone.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.200
She's nutso. Big deal.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.240
I think there's something
else wrong with her.

30:27.240 --> 30:31.240
I remember reading that in
Dr Auschlander's book.

30:32.880 --> 30:33.520
I'm dying.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.280
I'm dying.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.640
What are you dying of?

30:36.640 --> 30:39.600
Onions.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.400
Think you can help her?

30:41.400 --> 30:42.960
I'm going to try.

30:42.960 --> 30:46.960
I know what it's like
being someone no-one wants around.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.880
I'm sorry I ruined your locker.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.800
I'm sorry I took shots.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.120
Friends?

30:55.120 --> 30:56.560
Friends.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.920
DOORKNOB RATTLES

30:59.920 --> 31:03.920
Ssh.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.560
Didn't I tell you that pot
can lead to harder stuff?

31:12.560 --> 31:16.560
Like my fist?

31:50.400 --> 31:53.200
Now I know what all those stories
in Cosmo were talking about.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.160
I like your skin.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.400
Weird.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.320
No. Soft.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.960
I mean this.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.840
We meet in the gift shop,
get really turned on,

32:02.840 --> 32:04.360
then jump into bed

32:04.360 --> 32:07.480
without knowing
anything about each other.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.400
It's like Body Heat.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.000
Steamy passion.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.760
So what am I supposed
to do now - go?

32:14.760 --> 32:17.840
You can stay here
as long as you want.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.240
But I've got to boogaloo.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.360
Where?

32:22.360 --> 32:23.800
The hospital.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.400
Now? It's 3am.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.840
Believe me, I'd rather cuddle,

32:26.840 --> 32:29.240
but I owe everybody lunches
for covering for me.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.360
Got these past
hospital security.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.920
I could never do residency.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.280
Not enough sleep.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.400
Sleep's no problem -
it's all the other bull.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.320
The system's
designed to break you.

32:39.320 --> 32:40.720
Ever since med school,

32:40.720 --> 32:42.920
classmates sabotaging
your P-chem experiments

32:42.920 --> 32:44.280
just to get ahead.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.160
You've got to become
a jerk to outmanoeuvre.

32:47.160 --> 32:50.160
If medicine were only about
helping patients, it'd be great.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.760
Nice place.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.880
My dad bought this as an investment,
since I was coming to Boston,

32:54.880 --> 32:56.720
but now he's thinking about selling.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.960
Some new tax code
is going to leave me high and dry.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.240
Hey, I bet you could help me
with my chemistry.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.280
Remember anything
about rate-constants?

33:04.280 --> 33:05.800
Yeah. Zero.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.360
Same as Dad.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.360
Yeah? What's he do?

33:08.360 --> 33:09.720
Yeah? What's he do?

33:09.720 --> 33:10.880
Do I know him?

33:10.880 --> 33:14.880
Probably. He's Dr Westphall.

33:32.520 --> 33:36.040
Whew! Lucky me.
Rounds are late.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.120
Maybe Westphall
didn't show today.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.960
Caught a whiff of him in the
men's room.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.080
Too bad.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.040
You're telling me.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.360
What's the trouble, you unprepared?

33:44.360 --> 33:46.000
What's the trouble, you unprepared?

33:46.000 --> 33:49.080
Oh, yeah. Your patient Birch killed.

33:49.080 --> 33:52.120
It's more serious than that.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.320
What? You made fun
of his hairline?

33:54.320 --> 33:58.320
Slept with his daughter? (LAUGHS)

33:58.520 --> 34:00.080
You slept with
Westphall's daughter?

34:00.080 --> 34:01.320
You slept with
Westphall's daughter?

34:01.320 --> 34:03.880
You deflowered the princess?

34:03.880 --> 34:05.880
You savaged his one and only?

34:05.880 --> 34:09.880
You violated that little girl
we've practically watched grow up?

34:11.000 --> 34:12.440
How could you?

34:12.440 --> 34:13.880
And don't leave anything out.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.400
I didn't know who she was
until it was too late.

34:16.400 --> 34:20.400
So break it off. Gently, of course.
Swear her to silence,

34:20.400 --> 34:22.520
and hope Westphall
goes into a coma.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.679
You know the girl -
do you think she told him?

34:24.679 --> 34:25.920
No.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.600
Well, maybe.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.400
But if so, you'll be dead
any second... Dr Westphall.

34:30.400 --> 34:34.400
Sorry I'm late. Dr Fiscus,
you're up. Come on, we have to move.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.040
KNOCK ON DOOR

34:38.040 --> 34:42.040
Dr Auschlander?

34:54.400 --> 34:56.080
Luther?

34:56.080 --> 35:00.080
Oh, baby.
I'm sensitive on top.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.120
Luther!

35:02.120 --> 35:05.280
Hey.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.520
Oh!

35:06.520 --> 35:08.240
I must've been dreaming.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.640
About someone named Baby.

35:09.640 --> 35:12.120
What are you doing here?

35:12.120 --> 35:14.800
Looking something up.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.800
Let me ask you something.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.840
If you had a patient
with constant physical tics,

35:19.840 --> 35:23.040
erratic outbursts of swearing,
and antisocial behaviour,

35:23.040 --> 35:25.760
what would you do?

35:25.760 --> 35:27.520
I'd get a consult.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.920
You're just the man
I've been looking for.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.920
Follow me.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.880
Since changing Mr Broz's
antihypertensive medicine,

35:38.880 --> 35:40.800
he's had no side effects.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.920
Which side effects
were you looking for?

35:42.920 --> 35:44.920
Sedation
or postural hypotension.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.080
Good.

35:46.080 --> 35:50.080
Mr Broz, we'll see you later.
You're doing just fine.

35:56.120 --> 35:59.480
OK. That'll do it for today, people.
Thank you.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.920
Dr Griffin,
you have a moment?

36:01.920 --> 36:03.000
Yes.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.720
That was a fine
case presentation.

36:04.720 --> 36:05.880
Thank you.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.640
Neatly packaged, no loose ends.
Patient's doing remarkably well.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.840
I try.

36:10.840 --> 36:14.120
That's the one thing
that worries me.

36:14.120 --> 36:17.680
Is Mr Broz really as healthy as you
say, or is that all for my benefit?

36:17.680 --> 36:19.840
It's the truth.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.360
You're absolutely right, though.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.680
I do try too hard to be positive
sometimes.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.760
I can't help it -
I want to be a good doctor.

36:26.760 --> 36:29.560
It's not a failure
if a patient has problems, is it?

36:29.560 --> 36:30.680
Yes, sir.

36:30.680 --> 36:31.440
Just don't push. OK?

36:31.440 --> 36:33.400
Just don't push. OK?

36:33.400 --> 36:34.840
Didn't expect to see you.

36:34.840 --> 36:38.840
Lizzie, this is...

36:42.720 --> 36:44.800
Should I wear silver?

36:44.800 --> 36:46.240
I don't know.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.920
I've always worn gold.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.800
Think that's my problem,
afraid of change?

36:50.800 --> 36:53.960
You're right. With my colouring,
I should wear gold.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.880
How about a lighter frost, though?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.040
Why?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.440
Just to be different.

36:58.440 --> 37:01.040
What if you end up
looking like Annie Lennox?

37:01.040 --> 37:03.000
Seth Griffin asked me out.

37:03.000 --> 37:03.760
Oh?

37:03.760 --> 37:06.120
Oh?

37:06.120 --> 37:08.520
You and Westphall -
that's a risk.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.160
Yeah, well. I know.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.640
Helen, I didn't mean it that way.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.200
You said I
shouldn't be a nurse.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.880
You shouldn't just be a floor nurse
because you'd be a head nurse!

37:15.880 --> 37:17.360
You shouldn't just be a floor nurse
because you'd be a head nurse!

37:17.360 --> 37:19.320
If Lucy wanted to take a shot,
she could do a better job.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.000
If Lucy wanted to take a shot,
she could do a better job.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
You had to be holding
a urine specimen when you got angry!

37:25.000 --> 37:28.400
First time you three are in
relationships and I'm not.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.640
What one am I in?

37:29.640 --> 37:30.680
Ehrlich.

37:30.680 --> 37:31.840
&lt; Oh, please!

37:31.840 --> 37:33.360
Look at this.

37:33.360 --> 37:36.880
Lucy, you took a dare. Maybe Robert
was right to chuck everything we had

37:36.880 --> 37:38.280
for the sake of passion.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.360
You owe me a new uniform.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.320
You owe me a new uniform.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.600
Fine. Then we're even.

37:42.600 --> 37:45.680
I'll tell Mr Braun
to start work on another specimen.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.040
Helen, you've been with
a lot of men - four marriages.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.600
Four divorces.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.440
She  really  has a lot of nerve.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.600
11 years. I thought I knew him.
I was wrong.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.280
I'm scared to go through that again.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.920
It's worse being alone.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.880
Part of me wants to start again,
go out with someone new.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.320
But how do you find the courage
to start all over again?

38:03.320 --> 38:04.760
They're only men, Jackie.

38:04.760 --> 38:08.480
Right.

38:08.480 --> 38:12.480
Right.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.600
Shh! Sh-shh!

38:17.600 --> 38:18.960
D-D-Disease?

38:18.960 --> 38:21.840
No. Tourette syndrome
is a neurological disorder,

38:21.840 --> 38:24.160
a problem with chemicals
in the brain.

38:24.160 --> 38:27.920
Ha! I've been this way
as long as I can remember.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.520
The disorder
can begin as early as two years old.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.320
Two?

38:32.320 --> 38:36.320
Mommy and Daddy were always
telling me...

38:36.760 --> 38:38.560
.."slow down.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.480
"Quiet down.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.600
"Grow up."

38:41.600 --> 38:43.640
This isn't your fault, you know.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.280
Because of the chemical imbalance,

38:45.280 --> 38:47.480
you say or do things
you normally wouldn't.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.560
Hup!

38:48.560 --> 38:50.000
Inhibitions are lost.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.480
People say I'm crazy.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.400
That's because
they don't understand.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.760
I try to be like everyone else.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.800
It's hard to concentrate.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.840
I couldn't stop.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.520
Have to.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.160
Got no friends.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.760
People yelling at me.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.480
So I went where
no-one would notice.

39:07.480 --> 39:08.920
Where I'd fit in.

39:08.920 --> 39:11.200
Invisible on the street.

39:11.200 --> 39:15.200
We can't cure you,
but maybe we can help with drugs.

39:15.320 --> 39:18.520
This could
change your whole life.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.840
OK.

39:19.840 --> 39:22.720
Nigger. Nigger.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.600
Nigger.

39:24.600 --> 39:28.480
See you.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.560
I'll recommend that
Polly be put on Haldol

39:30.560 --> 39:32.760
and I'll call in
social services to talk with her.

39:32.760 --> 39:35.600
I thought she'd be more grateful.

39:35.600 --> 39:39.160
Sometimes people don't know
how much help they need.

39:39.160 --> 39:42.360
Polly's learned to adapt her problem
to the environment.

39:42.360 --> 39:44.720
She lives with it.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.520
It's admirable. She's a survivor.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.160
You think she'll get better?

39:49.160 --> 39:52.520
The medication should control
the tics and vocalisations,

39:52.520 --> 39:56.360
but she's got a lot
of catching up to do,

39:56.360 --> 39:59.320
which means a lot of commitment
and disappointments.

39:59.320 --> 40:03.320
That's especially tough with
the reward so far in the distance.

40:04.280 --> 40:08.280
Good diagnosis, Luther.

40:09.360 --> 40:13.360
No, no, no.
This isn't it. I said red.

40:43.680 --> 40:47.680
I don't even know
these guys.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.880
Helen, have you seen John Doe?

40:51.880 --> 40:54.080
Yeah, he said he was going
for a walk. Why?

40:54.080 --> 40:57.880
That nitwit stole my hands, plaque,
clock, typewriter, the Dictaphone

40:57.880 --> 41:00.640
and 333 of the best pages
of my life.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.040
Get me security.
And Auschlander.

41:03.040 --> 41:05.240
We're going to
get together, right?

41:05.240 --> 41:06.400
Sure.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.720
Tonight? Tomorrow?

41:07.720 --> 41:09.280
Oh, um...

41:09.280 --> 41:12.360
I'm working
every day this week.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.080
Why don't I call you, OK?

41:14.080 --> 41:16.440
OK. I'll look forward to it.

41:16.440 --> 41:20.440
Bye.  Bye.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.600
(SIGHS)

41:22.600 --> 41:23.640
Whoa. I'll wait.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.440
Whoa. I'll wait.

41:26.440 --> 41:27.960
There.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.400
How are you doing?

41:29.400 --> 41:31.320
Fine. You?

41:31.320 --> 41:34.040
Oh!

41:34.040 --> 41:36.760
The usual.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.120
That's a nice pin.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.880
My grandfather's.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.560
He was a medic in
the Spanish Civil War.

41:43.560 --> 41:46.600
Went off with Hemingway
to fight Franco.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.400
Died there.

41:50.400 --> 41:54.400
Listen...

41:54.560 --> 41:58.160
..like you said yesterday...

41:58.160 --> 42:00.680
..maybe we could
go out sometime.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.440
Dinner.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.920
Movie.

42:03.920 --> 42:04.880
I thought...

42:04.880 --> 42:08.880
I thought...

42:10.120 --> 42:13.400
Jackie, I...

42:13.400 --> 42:17.400
I don't think that would be
a good idea just now.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.000
Oh...

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
God.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.000
Hello, Mark.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.200
Your hand?

42:58.200 --> 43:00.800
No. It's Michigan
with the mitten off.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.080
And here's Ypsilanti.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.400
Took me four days to hitchhike
from Saginaw.

43:05.400 --> 43:08.120
Boy, oh, boy. Chippying around
with Carol Novino

43:08.120 --> 43:10.960
has really salted your pork,
hasn't it, Donald?

43:10.960 --> 43:12.640
And who presses your shirts?

43:12.640 --> 43:14.320
You do something else to your hand?

43:14.320 --> 43:15.960
I opened up the scar.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.800
And don't start in with
the fatherly lectures, all right?

43:18.800 --> 43:19.520
I wasn't going to.

43:19.520 --> 43:22.120
I wasn't going to.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.440
Yeah, I know.

43:23.440 --> 43:27.440
I told Lizzie to get out,
start dating, have fun.

43:27.720 --> 43:28.200
What are you talking about?

43:28.200 --> 43:29.400
What are you talking about?

43:29.400 --> 43:31.800
I slaved over 300 pages,

43:31.800 --> 43:34.680
and now, right at the end,
I'm dead in the water.

43:34.680 --> 43:35.960
Doe's flown the coop.

43:35.960 --> 43:36.800
He's what?

43:36.800 --> 43:39.840
He's what?

43:39.840 --> 43:41.360
Start over.

43:41.360 --> 43:44.560
Oh, boy. That's just like you.

43:44.560 --> 43:46.320
I'd never remember it all.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.560
It's a tough break, Mark.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.920
Listen.
Don't breathe a word to Ellen.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.520
The book was her idea.
She'll be heartbroken.

43:52.520 --> 43:56.520
Loved ones can do that to you,
can't they?

Dr Auschlander,
you wanted to see me?

Before you say anything,
I want to come back.

45:03.720 --> 45:05.760
What brought this on?

45:05.760 --> 45:09.360
I diagnosed a patient
by myself.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.840
I realised that helping people
at the hospital

45:11.840 --> 45:13.440
is what I really want to do,

45:13.440 --> 45:15.720
even if it is
going to take four years.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.960
Or less.

45:17.960 --> 45:19.240
I've just received word

45:19.240 --> 45:22.560
from the UMass College

45:22.560 --> 45:24.160
They'll give you credit

45:24.160 --> 45:26.760
for prior learning
plus work experience.

You can get through there and
