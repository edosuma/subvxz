what do you have to do

Why? We live in just as big

Where do we get to escape to?

I put in all this
time and effort,

Malcolm correct everything

We had to pick one

Can I just watch you
for a while?

02:31.020 --> 02:33.501
-Sure. As a matter of fact,
you can help me with myproject.
-What are you doing?

to see what decorations

finds a way to top me.

strings better lights.

puts out an elf village.

he does nothing

I mean, what kind
of sick mind

02:55.087 --> 02:57.046

02:58.656 --> 02:59.831

now she's taking over dinner?

03:47.357 --> 03:48.880
This isn't even food.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.708
Reese, it's just low-fat.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.754
And if you knew anything
at all about food,

03:52.841 --> 03:54.843
you'd know that fats and oils
are the vehicles

03:54.930 --> 03:56.192
by which flavor travels.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.150
Fat is what makes
things taste good.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.198
That's why a wise and loving God
created fat in the first place.

04:02.285 --> 04:06.246
She is a guest in our home,
and I think it's delicious.

04:08.770 --> 04:12.164

floating in the water?

announcement to make.

with the conspiracy trial

04:26.831 --> 04:28.442
and your father and me
losing our jobs,

04:28.529 --> 04:30.008
we ended up $20,000 in debt.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.619
Yeah?

04:31.706 --> 04:33.229
Well, after six months
of scrimping and saving

04:33.316 --> 04:35.144
and going up to $28,000 in debt,

04:35.231 --> 04:38.016
we are now down
to $26,000 in debt!

04:38.103 --> 04:39.496
Look out world, we're back!

04:39.583 --> 04:41.324
I know how much you boys
have sacrificed,

04:41.411 --> 04:43.761
kicking in your paychecks
and working extra shifts,

04:43.848 --> 04:46.068
and, well, we thought
you guys deserved a reward.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.939
-Really?
-This is great.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.768
I thought she was going to
start charging us for water.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.727
So, your dad and I
are taking the whole family--

04:52.814 --> 04:55.686

04:55.773 --> 04:58.080
a musical!

04:58.167 --> 05:00.300
A what?

05:00.387 --> 05:01.344
A musical.

05:01.431 --> 05:02.780
From Broadway.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.478
It's called Mamma Mia.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.697
They take all those
old ABBA songs

05:06.784 --> 05:08.133
like "Dancing Queen,"
and "Fernando,"

05:08.220 --> 05:09.439
and stick some story in between.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.615
Oh, my God, you're serious.

05:11.702 --> 05:14.183
Six partially obstructed seats.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.576
At first I thought
of treating

05:15.663 --> 05:17.186
you boys to a rock concert
or Motocross

05:17.273 --> 05:19.231
or something like that, but then
Jessica told me about this

05:19.319 --> 05:20.624
and I thought
this sounded perfect.

05:20.711 --> 05:22.191
Wow! I mean, I just mentioned it

05:22.278 --> 05:23.584
'cause it was interesting.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.499
I didn't think
you were gonna take me.

Calculus notes.

How can a man have
nipples that big?

You can hang out here

05:41.471 --> 05:42.733

from your dad,

05:42.820 --> 05:43.995
but don't act like
we're friends, okay?

05:44.082 --> 05:45.432
Why are you mad at me?

05:45.519 --> 05:46.781
Because I stick up
for you all the time.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.391
You turn around
and manipulate my mom

05:48.478 --> 05:50.175
into doing something
only you want to do.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.655
Wait. You're talking
about the show?

05:51.742 --> 05:53.701
Let me explain
something to you, Jessica.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.530
My family doesn't have fun.
We aren't nice.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.880
And the one time Mom actually
does do something nice,

05:58.967 --> 06:00.360
you hijack it
for your own...

06:00.447 --> 06:02.231

I did it for Reese.

06:02.318 --> 06:03.537
What does Reese
have to do with it?

06:03.624 --> 06:04.886
You know what he
has to do with it.

06:04.973 --> 06:05.930
No, I don't.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.280
Please tell me you're kidding.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.326
About what?

06:10.413 --> 06:11.893
Oh, my God.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.374
You honestly don't know.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.768
You are actually
so self-involved

06:17.855 --> 06:19.640
and narcissistic that
you can't even see it.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.729
-See what?
-You know what, Malcolm?

06:21.816 --> 06:23.470
Why don't you try to go
for maybe two seconds

06:23.557 --> 06:25.385
without thinking about yourself
and see what you notice?

06:25.472 --> 06:26.864
Stop insulting me.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.562
What the hell are
you talking about?

06:28.649 --> 06:30.259
And it never even occurred

06:30.346 --> 06:32.304
to you to wonder why Reese
is so angry all the time?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.741
Why he acts like such a jerk?

06:33.828 --> 06:35.307
Because he's a jerk.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.048
That's right. Just because
he's your brother

06:37.135 --> 06:38.963
doesn't mean you should
put any thought into it.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.574
He couldn't possibly be dealing

06:40.661 --> 06:42.837
with anything weird
and confusing.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.621
He couldn't possibly be afraid

06:44.708 --> 06:46.318
to admit that he wanted
to go see a musical

06:46.406 --> 06:48.016
because you'd make fun of him.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.626
Of course I'd
make fun of him.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.193
What kind of guy wants
to see a Broadway musical?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.108
Yes, Malcolm.

06:53.195 --> 06:57.242
What kind of a guy does want
to go see a Broadway musical?

07:00.115 --> 07:01.508
Come on.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.248
Maybe you're not being selfish.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.772
Maybe you're just too scared

07:04.859 --> 07:06.426
where it leads if you think

07:06.513 --> 07:09.080
about how much he fusses
over his hair and his body

07:09.167 --> 07:10.430
and his gourmet cooking.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.909
Some people
just don't want

07:11.996 --> 07:14.346
to see what's right in front
of their faces.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.960
Nuh-uh.

07:19.047 --> 07:22.137
Look, maybe I'm butting
in where I don't belong,

07:22.224 --> 07:23.965
but you're his brother,

07:24.052 --> 07:26.837
and he should at least be able
to count on you for support.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.932
Thanks a lot for sticking us
with that stupid show.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.892
I didn't do it for me,
I did it for your brother.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.547
Malcolm's gay?
I knew it!

07:45.726 --> 07:49.338
Wow! Look at it go, huh?

07:49.425 --> 07:51.209

07:51.296 --> 07:52.472
for one of the most devastating
attacks in American history,

but by God,
they make a good toy.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.954
Is that what I think it is?

a little peek.

I might have jazzed it up
a little.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.493
Dewey, everything in this report
is just made up.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.060
Hmm, every word of it.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.323
I... I never did
any of this stuff.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.543
Are you sure? I could've
sworn Mom said something

08:20.630 --> 08:23.067
about you giving your parachute
to an orphan in midair.

08:23.154 --> 08:26.767
You are not going to turn in
a paper full of lies.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.551
But, Dad, it's due on Tuesday!

08:28.638 --> 08:30.771
You're just gonna have
to find another way.

08:30.858 --> 08:34.034
Let me explain something
about heroism, son.

08:34.121 --> 08:36.732
There are all kinds of
bravery in the world.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.691
[buzzing]

08:37.778 --> 08:39.214
All kinds.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.259
You don't have to be
a Special Forces Ranger

08:41.346 --> 08:43.957
or fight crime in a cape
to be a hero.

08:44.044 --> 08:46.917
There's the unsung bravery
of the common man.

08:47.004 --> 08:50.051
Normal people who prove
their courage every day,

08:50.138 --> 08:53.141
by standing up
for their families or...

08:53.228 --> 08:54.751
being decent
to other people and...

08:54.838 --> 08:57.667
[yelping]

08:57.754 --> 08:59.234
Ooohhh!

08:59.321 --> 09:00.844
Is it bleeding?

09:00.931 --> 09:02.411
Ow, ow, ow.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.766
Hey.

09:09.853 --> 09:10.767
Hey!

09:16.947 --> 09:17.861
You want half?

09:17.948 --> 09:19.254
I'll fix my own.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.699
Peanut butter's good, too.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.353
Nothing wrong
with having peanut butter.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.876
What?

09:32.963 --> 09:34.138
Just because I'm having ham

09:34.225 --> 09:35.705
doesn't mean you
have to have ham.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.186
Just because we're brothers

09:38.273 --> 09:40.188
doesn't mean we have to enjoy
the same thing, right?

09:41.972 --> 09:42.973
Exactly.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.366
Everybody's different.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.976
It'd be stupid
if I tried to force you

09:46.063 --> 09:47.195
to like something I liked.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.414
Right. Plus,
it wouldn't work anyway.

09:49.501 --> 09:50.764
People can't help what
they like.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.113
That's just the way
they're born.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.767
I know. Like me,

09:53.854 --> 09:56.770
I've never liked... ham.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.989
Really? 'Cause maybe
if you tried it...

09:59.076 --> 10:01.557
No. But that's me.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.080
I'm not putting it
down or anything.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.299
I hear you.

10:04.386 --> 10:05.692
There's no...

10:05.779 --> 10:08.608
right sandwich.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.136
So, um... the ABBA thing...

10:15.223 --> 10:16.224
Should be great.

10:16.311 --> 10:17.660
Yeah, absolutely.
Just great.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.534
Hey.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.537
Have a good snack.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.539
You, too.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.239
Hal, you have
to get ready.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.675
The show starts in an hour,

10:32.762 --> 10:34.329
and we still have to drop
Jamie off on the way.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.810
Almost done. Hey, have
you seen Dewey around?

10:36.897 --> 10:38.812
I promised him he could
fire-bomb the Utah.

10:38.899 --> 10:39.987
He's doing schoolwork.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.162
It was so sweet.

10:41.249 --> 10:42.903
He told me this afternoon

10:42.990 --> 10:45.383
he's writing a 300-word report
about how I'm his hero.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.913
What a wonderful night!

10:53.000 --> 10:54.958
How could they say
the theater is dead

10:55.045 --> 10:56.307
when a spectacle
like that

10:56.394 --> 10:57.961
is being bused
all over the country?

10:58.048 --> 11:00.050
Yeah, who knew you could use
the same three chords

11:00.137 --> 11:03.097
over and over and people would
sit through it for two hours?

11:03.184 --> 11:05.926
You can be Mr. Fancy Pants
music snob if you like,

11:06.013 --> 11:07.318
but everyone else loved it.

11:09.973 --> 11:10.974
JESSICA:
Thank you for including me.

11:11.061 --> 11:12.454
I had so much fun.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.325
Yeah, me, too.
I especially liked the part

11:14.412 --> 11:16.501
where the father was stabbed
in the back by his son.

11:16.588 --> 11:17.894
That wasn't in
the show, Hal.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.156
Well, I saw it somewhere.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.333
I'm glad you boys
liked it so much.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.161
I've never seen
you like this.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.467
You didn't stop smiling

11:25.554 --> 11:26.947
at each other all night.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.558
How could you not love
a show like that?

11:29.645 --> 11:32.082
Yeah, nothing creepy
about it at all.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.083
You guys want to listen
to the CD again?

11:33.170 --> 11:34.868
Again?

11:34.955 --> 11:36.608
Oh, yeah. Love ABBA.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.436
I could listen
to it forever.

adolescent humor to yourself,
Your Honor."

12:37.757 --> 12:39.976
Let's just say two days
of picking up trash

12:40.063 --> 12:41.586
on the freeway
never felt so good.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.371
Wow, all these great stories:

12:43.458 --> 12:45.852
the judge, those bikers...

12:45.939 --> 12:47.462
I don't know any other way
to say this, Mom,

12:47.549 --> 12:49.377
but you're kind of a... bad-ass.

12:49.464 --> 12:52.075
You know I don't appreciate
that kind of language.

12:52.162 --> 12:55.296
If anyone cares,
I'll be in the garage alone,

12:55.383 --> 12:56.601
commemorating our heroic stand

12:56.688 --> 12:59.300
against a heartless,
back-stabbing,

12:59.387 --> 13:01.041
traitorous attack.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.346
Okay, hon.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.695
Then there was this time
at the store

13:03.783 --> 13:06.220
with this huge
shoplifter, and he...

13:06.307 --> 13:09.614
MAN ON TV:
Beautiful Bianca is ready
to make the Fashionistas swoon

13:09.701 --> 13:12.226
in her flowing crepe jumpsuit
with open neckline.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.401
This is nice.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.446
What'd you think
of the Versace?

13:15.533 --> 13:20.364
Well, it has a nice drape,
and it seems like a...

13:20.451 --> 13:22.540
kicky look for fall.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.543
Yeah, I think it's...

13:25.630 --> 13:27.284
yummy.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.200
[both scream]

13:32.115 --> 13:34.248
Okay, you know what?

13:34.335 --> 13:36.293
This is stupid.
We have to talk about this.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.642
Right.
I mean,

13:37.729 --> 13:38.992
just because it's
weird doesn't mean

13:39.079 --> 13:40.341
we can't handle it.
We're brothers.

13:40.428 --> 13:41.908
Right. We've been through
everything together.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.649
We shouldn't be pussyfooting
around about it.

13:44.736 --> 13:45.868
I got you something.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.391
Hey, I got yousomething.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.959
Really? See, this is
what I'm talking about.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.961
We're being open and
supportive and honest
with each other.

13:52.048 --> 13:52.962
Here.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.356
What's this?

13:55.443 --> 13:57.488
It's called "If You're Gay,
It's Okay."

13:57.575 --> 13:59.099
It's full
of great resources.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.100
What's this?

14:00.187 --> 14:01.710
Naughty Pool Boys III.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.234
I watched ten or 12 of these,
and this one seems

14:04.321 --> 14:05.801
to have the most stuff
you guys like.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.718
Wait. I'm not gay.
You're gay.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.111
No, I'm not. You are.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.939
I'm not gay.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.331
Malcolm, check out
what they're doing
in that movie,

14:14.418 --> 14:15.463
and then tell me
you're not gay.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.465
No, this is...

14:17.552 --> 14:18.988
She said...

14:21.425 --> 14:24.254
[laughing]

14:31.566 --> 14:32.654
Oh, my God!

14:32.741 --> 14:34.699
You plan, you hope,

14:34.786 --> 14:38.790
but you never think
it's going turn out this good!

14:38.878 --> 14:40.705
Stop laughing.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.707
I don't think I can!

14:44.492 --> 14:45.928
When you guys were dancing,

14:46.015 --> 14:47.930
and you did that little...

14:48.017 --> 14:49.714
Oh, my God, it was so sweet!

14:51.586 --> 14:54.719
There's nothing more
I can ask for, honestly.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.634
You guys make me so happy!

14:56.721 --> 14:58.854
Oh, God, it hurts!

15:00.769 --> 15:02.727
Well, I better go drag
my dad off the lawn.

15:02.814 --> 15:05.643
He likes to fall asleep
right next to the toilet.

15:05.730 --> 15:06.775
[laughing]

15:06.862 --> 15:08.820
See you guys
at dinner.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.128
[laughing continues]

15:12.215 --> 15:13.129
Vendetta.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.130
How could she be so...?

15:14.217 --> 15:15.479
Vendetta!

15:15.566 --> 15:16.959
Yes, vendetta.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.961
Reese, I promise,
we'll get back at her.

15:19.048 --> 15:23.096
But we have to be careful.
She's got Mom
totally on her side.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.184
Oh, yeah.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.620
It's tricky.

15:25.707 --> 15:26.751
Somehow, we've got
to figure out a way

15:26.838 --> 15:27.883
to turn Mom against her.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.276
Okay, got it.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.408
-What?
-It's a little risky,

15:31.495 --> 15:32.888
but I'll tell you
one thing.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.934
No one calls me gay
and gets away with it!

15:35.021 --> 15:37.240
[gasping]

15:42.115 --> 15:44.160
[rattling]

15:51.689 --> 15:52.690
Wow.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.525
Dad, it's beautiful.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.964
Well, I did what
I could on my own.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.357
Yeah.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.706
Sorry.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.669
Then he accused me
of loving Mom more than him

16:14.756 --> 16:16.976
just because I wouldn't slash
her boyfriend's tires.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.412
I'm so sorry, honey.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.501
Parents shouldn't put
their kids in the middle.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.285
Or hit on their friends.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.200
Boys, come get the groceries.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.289
I hope this means
we can eat soon.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.508
Hold it.

16:27.595 --> 16:28.770
What's that?

16:29.771 --> 16:31.164
What?
That.

16:31.251 --> 16:32.426
A turtleneck.
What do you care?

16:32.513 --> 16:33.905
You don't wear
turtlenecks.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.472
Can I just get the groceries
so we can eat?

16:35.559 --> 16:36.647
I've got a ton of homework...

16:36.734 --> 16:37.909
Aha!

16:37.997 --> 16:39.476
Mom, don't!
Who gave you that?

16:39.563 --> 16:40.782
None of your business!

16:40.869 --> 16:42.566
What is your problem,
anyway?

16:42.653 --> 16:45.743
Can't you go five seconds
without butting into my life?

16:47.310 --> 16:48.398
What?

16:48.485 --> 16:50.748
It wasn't her, Mom!
I swear!

16:50.835 --> 16:52.054
You always think
you know everything,

16:52.141 --> 16:53.055
but you're wrong!

16:53.142 --> 16:55.579
You're dead wrong
this time!

16:55.666 --> 16:58.104
I think you and I need
to have a little talk.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.453
-But I...
-Come on.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.502
When your mom comes out,

17:05.589 --> 17:07.156
she's gonna want
to know

17:07.242 --> 17:09.115
what I said
to you about this.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.420
Make up something good.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.833
He did it to me again!

17:36.011 --> 17:38.057
I suppose you have
a good explanation
for this.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.884
Not really.

17:39.971 --> 17:40.929
Lois, I'm sorry.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.713
I'm not going to lie to you.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.193
I gave him the hickey

17:44.280 --> 17:46.282
to keep him from doing something
really stupid.

17:46.369 --> 17:47.762
Excuse me?

17:47.849 --> 17:49.329
I'm not saying
I was smart either, but...

17:49.416 --> 17:51.026
There's this girl
that Malcolm's been chasing,

17:51.113 --> 17:53.550
and she's really bad news.
She's sexually active

17:53.637 --> 17:55.204
and I'm pretty sure
she's into drugs,

17:55.291 --> 17:57.424
and the only reason why
he's interested in her

17:57.511 --> 17:59.948
is because he's so insecure
about himself.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.037
We got into this fight

18:02.124 --> 18:04.866
and I was saying that
he could do so much better

18:04.953 --> 18:07.347
and he said that nobody
liked him anyway,

18:07.434 --> 18:09.305
and I was telling him
that a lot of girls liked him

18:09.392 --> 18:11.873
because he's sweet
and cute and funny,

18:11.960 --> 18:14.397
and then he kinda grabbed me
and we started kissing

18:14.484 --> 18:16.704
and I couldn't stop
because then he would think

18:16.791 --> 18:18.619
I was making the whole thing up
and...

18:20.360 --> 18:22.144
I'm sorry.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.799
I didn't know what else to do.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.148
[sobbing]

18:27.715 --> 18:30.500
Wow, that's a pretty convincing
lie for just winging it.

18:31.545 --> 18:32.415
I mean, you went a little

18:32.502 --> 18:33.634
overboard with the crying,

18:33.721 --> 18:34.722
but the basic story was good.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.245
Drug girl was a nice touch.

18:36.332 --> 18:37.812
Creepy, a little sad.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.727
But how did you...?

18:39.814 --> 18:44.166
Sweetie, I'm a mother.
It's my business to know.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.951
You've got talent,
but I turned pro 20 years ago.

18:47.038 --> 18:48.257
Which isn't to say

18:48.344 --> 18:50.216
you haven't been useful.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.261
I never would've been able
to enjoy that play in peace

18:52.348 --> 18:53.697
if the boys weren't occupied.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.482
And the gay thing
was very entertaining.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.484
But more important,
those two idiots

18:57.571 --> 19:00.313
actually treated each other
decently for a few days.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.532
Thank you for that.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.144
So, here's the deal.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.841
As of today,
you are banned from this house.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.451
You violated my trust.

19:08.538 --> 19:09.887
I don't want you around my boys.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.760
Knowing that,

19:12.847 --> 19:17.112
they will automatically forgive
you and sneak you back in.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.419
You will be here every day
after school until 6:00,

19:19.506 --> 19:21.464
except Thursdays
when I work until 9:30.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.249
You will have complete run
of the house,

19:23.336 --> 19:26.121
but I want Reese to do his
half hour of assigned reading

19:26.208 --> 19:28.210
and Malcolm to complete
all his college applications,

19:28.297 --> 19:29.516
not just the Ivy Leagues.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.301
And no junk food.
Understood?

19:32.388 --> 19:33.781
For how long?

19:33.868 --> 19:35.086
We'll see.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.914
"Ice Capades" are coming
in a few months.

19:37.001 --> 19:39.787
Sure would be nice
to go as a family.

19:43.747 --> 19:44.835
Do you think we have enough?

19:44.922 --> 19:46.750
Let's hope so.
I cleaned out

19:46.837 --> 19:48.274
every bait shop in town.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.069
What the hell
did you do that for?

21:28.156 --> 21:29.897
Your stuff was in my spot.

21:29.984 --> 21:31.681
I would've moved it.
Try asking, butt-munch.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.554
Right, like you hear anything
but the sound of your own voice.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.251
-Get bent.
-Bite me.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.734
I liked you better
when we were gay.

21:40.821 --> 21:43.302
Me, too.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.384
