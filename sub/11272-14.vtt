00:18.002 --> 00:20.492
- Vodka martini and a Seltzer.
- You got it.

00:30.549 --> 00:32.374
Thank you.

00:58.728 --> 01:00.554
Beer.

02:26.556 --> 02:29.306
Holy coyote! What's that stink?

02:30.641 --> 02:34.388
Smells like they're burning
the chef's special at Melville's.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.131
Smells like they're burning the chef.

02:37.311 --> 02:40.226
No. Wait, l know what that smell is.

02:44.479 --> 02:49.353
- Anybody mind if l smoke?
- Not if you put the lit end in your mouth.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.857
l learned how to smoke them this way,
Carla, and l'll stick with it.

03:01.695 --> 03:06.687
- Boy, is somebody boiling tar in here?
- No, Sam. l'm smoking my cigar.

03:06.864 --> 03:09.615
Would someone please boil some tar?

03:09.782 --> 03:12.070
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

03:15.117 --> 03:18.319
- What's new, Normie?
- Terrorists, Sam.

03:19.286 --> 03:23.661
They've taken over my stomach
and they're demanding beer.

03:23.830 --> 03:26.912
- lt's a world gone mad.
- What's that stench?

03:27.081 --> 03:30.530
lt's my cigar, Normie.
Let me know if it bothers you.

03:31.625 --> 03:35.323
- lt bothers me.
- Join the club.

03:36.084 --> 03:38.206
New cologne, Sam?

03:39.503 --> 03:41.827
lt's a step up.

03:42.004 --> 03:45.288
Do you have any idea
how much that cigar stinks?

03:45.464 --> 03:49.245
Are you kidding?
lt's right below my nose.

03:49.423 --> 03:54.463
- Sammy, all set to...
- You bet, good buddy.

03:55.551 --> 04:00.127
Did that gesture signify
a primitive mating ritual?

04:00.303 --> 04:03.919
Actually we are going up
to the woods to spend the day fishing.

04:04.096 --> 04:07.379
Fishing. How lovely.

04:07.557 --> 04:13.093
You know, it's truly essential
to one's peace of mind now and then

04:13.267 --> 04:17.760
to get back in tune with the rhythms of
nature and shed the mechanised world.

04:17.935 --> 04:20.969
You're right.
Did you remember to bring the TV set?

04:21.144 --> 04:24.595
- Yeah. l got a portable VCR, Sam.
- Good.

04:24.772 --> 04:29.929
- l rented ''Porky's ll'' and ''Splash''.
- All right.

04:33.150 --> 04:38.652
- You have a fish tracking device, too?
- That wouldn't be sportsmanlike.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.391
We prefer depth charges.

04:43.904 --> 04:48.150
- So, you guys are going fishing?
- Yeah, go pull some lip.

04:50.657 --> 04:53.859
- You got it.
- Boy, l love fishing.

04:54.034 --> 04:58.028
- A spur-of-the-moment decision?
- No, we've planned this.

04:58.202 --> 05:00.241
- Check this lake.
- Looks good.

05:00.411 --> 05:05.237
- l guess you forgot to tell me.
- l don't know. l don't remember.

05:05.413 --> 05:07.452
Well, l do. You didn't.

05:07.623 --> 05:11.073
Maybe you mentioned it
to another best friend

05:11.249 --> 05:13.917
who lives
for doing manly things in the wild.

05:15.083 --> 05:17.159
You want to go fishing with us?

05:17.335 --> 05:21.496
l don't want to infringe
on you and Norm's good time.

05:21.671 --> 05:24.788
You're going to have to
if you want come along.

05:24.963 --> 05:27.169
Come on, let's go fishing.

05:27.339 --> 05:32.211
- l'd better check my social calendar.
- That's the wall of the men's room.

05:32.384 --> 05:38.750
- l wouldn't mind doing a little fishing.
- Me neither. You got room?

05:38.927 --> 05:41.299
What the hell? Let's make it a party.

05:41.470 --> 05:44.553
- l thought it was just going to be us.
- Come on, Cliff.

05:44.722 --> 05:50.508
l'm just surprised you are so eager to go
someplace you're obviously not wanted.

05:50.682 --> 05:53.681
There's some gear
in the back there, guys.

05:56.518 --> 05:59.386
- Hello, Diane.
- Hi, Frasier.

06:04.354 --> 06:07.023
Your lips are troubled.

06:07.189 --> 06:10.557
No wonder.
Look at the hell he puts them through.

06:14.150 --> 06:18.063
Well, this has been a bad day.
Bad week. Bad month.

06:18.236 --> 06:22.231
This time of the year is murder
on the psychiatric profession.

06:22.403 --> 06:24.727
Just sit down and relax.

06:24.905 --> 06:28.070
- Scotch, Sam.
- You have problems there, Frase?

06:28.239 --> 06:32.282
All the neuroses l face every day
have a negative effect on me.

06:32.450 --> 06:34.857
Why don't you do what l did?

06:35.034 --> 06:39.029
Throw her clothes in the hallway
and lock the door.

06:40.704 --> 06:45.445
Diane is my salvation. lt's my patients
that have caused this distress.

06:45.622 --> 06:52.036
Miserable people pouring out
their litany of depression and anxiety.

06:52.208 --> 06:55.989
The only way my situation
could be worse is if l listened to them.

06:56.168 --> 06:59.830
Even at a time like this,
his humour survived.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.666
l know exactly what you're saying, Doc.
l do.

07:03.838 --> 07:08.081
After years behind this bar,
l've learned how to make people happy.

07:08.256 --> 07:10.081
How's that?

07:10.257 --> 07:13.754
Whatever problem they got,
l point out the bigger problem.

07:13.924 --> 07:16.461
Like in your case, you're going bald.

07:22.095 --> 07:25.842
l am? Now l'm depressed
and losing my hair.

07:26.014 --> 07:31.515
That's nothing. lt's child's play compared
to that big mole you got on your neck.

07:33.099 --> 07:37.889
- Please, no more. l'm cheered up.
- Any time, Doc.

07:38.060 --> 07:43.182
All right, Sammy. Just one quick stop
to change clothes and we'll be all set.

07:43.354 --> 07:46.437
Okey-dokey.
Hope things look up for you, Frasier.

07:46.605 --> 07:49.356
- Going fishing, are you?
- Yeah.

07:49.523 --> 07:56.138
How idyllic. Away from the noise,
the crime, the borderline psychotics.

07:56.317 --> 07:59.187
Actually, Cliffie's coming along, too.

08:00.028 --> 08:03.690
l was just kidding, Cliff.
OK, Coach. Good night.

08:03.862 --> 08:06.399
See you guys. Be back later.

08:06.571 --> 08:09.820
Sam, it looks like
you might have room for one more.

08:09.989 --> 08:15.491
lsn't there someone else you'd like to
invite? A very depressed gentleman?

08:18.368 --> 08:21.533
The bass are about this big there.
Want to go get one?

08:22.538 --> 08:26.035
l've never been fishing
but it might be just what l need.

08:26.205 --> 08:29.572
- lf none of you mind, count me in.
- Goody.

08:32.541 --> 08:34.864
Watch out, fish. Here l come.

08:37.251 --> 08:41.116
You want to come along?
We're running a little low on bait.

08:41.294 --> 08:43.534
Cut it out, you kidder.

08:44.379 --> 08:48.126
Take care of my fella.
He's a tenderfoot.

08:51.465 --> 08:55.294
- How come you're not going?
- l don't like to smell them.

08:55.467 --> 08:58.501
- Yeah, fish stink.
- No, the guys.

08:58.677 --> 09:03.964
Out in that sun all day, stuck in the muck.
Who needs it?

09:10.473 --> 09:13.556
- Want to play Red Sox trivia?
- Sure. Fire away.

09:13.725 --> 09:17.555
Good. l got some real tough ones
for you this time. Ready?

09:17.726 --> 09:21.593
Number one. What over 300 hitter was
called...

09:21.770 --> 09:24.639
- Jimmy Foxx.
- Right.

09:24.813 --> 09:28.144
That was just an easy warm-up.
Now we're going to start.

09:28.314 --> 09:29.938
Shoot.

09:30.107 --> 09:32.976
- What Red Sox shortstop...
- Don Buddin.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.891
- An outfielder...
- Conigliaro.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.766
Boy, you are good. Try me now.

09:42.778 --> 09:46.110
- Who was the only man to pinch hit...
- Lu Clinton.

09:46.280 --> 09:51.022
- You sure you want to go on?
- lt's not as much fun as it used to be.

09:51.199 --> 09:57.399
- Think we've played together too long?
- Was the next answer Frank Malzone?

09:57.576 --> 09:59.781
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:08.914 --> 10:12.992
- Looks like you had a good time.
- Great time, Diane. Great time.

10:13.167 --> 10:15.204
l'm so glad.

10:16.292 --> 10:18.331
Where's Frasier?

10:23.420 --> 10:25.458
Did l say something amusing?

10:26.547 --> 10:31.087
You're going to get a giggle out of this.
Frasier's still up in the woods.

10:31.257 --> 10:33.165
He's snipe hunting.

10:34.257 --> 10:37.459
You sent him on a snipe hunt. l love it.

10:37.634 --> 10:40.206
What's a snipe hunt?

10:40.385 --> 10:45.259
lt's an age-old custom wherein we take
an uninitiated hunter like Dr Crane,

10:45.429 --> 10:49.721
put him in a clearing with a gunnysack
and we beat out the snipe to him.

10:52.141 --> 10:56.218
Rather an elemental sport
but l don't see the humour in it.

10:56.392 --> 11:00.601
The humour is that while the guy's
out there with a gunnysack,

11:00.770 --> 11:04.386
we have dinner in a restaurant
and come here for some beers.

11:08.231 --> 11:14.680
There's no such thing as a snipe, so
there's no reason for us to hang around.

11:14.859 --> 11:19.102
But since the bagger doesn't know that,
he stays and we leave.

11:22.611 --> 11:25.279
l swear to you, this is really funny.

11:26.988 --> 11:30.437
You should have seen your buddy.
He's a real sport.

11:30.615 --> 11:33.484
He was practising the bagger's position.

11:35.742 --> 11:38.610
Sammy made up this terrific snipe call.

11:42.286 --> 11:46.745
- Actually somebody else made that up.
- You could hear him from miles.

11:49.707 --> 11:53.286
ln other words,
you abandoned Frasier in the woods.

11:53.458 --> 11:58.413
Well, that's another way of putting it.
But it doesn't sound as funny that way.

11:59.710 --> 12:05.330
Of all the immature, aberrant behaviour
ever exhibited here, this is the lowest.

12:05.505 --> 12:10.496
- What do you mean, Sam?
- You're the ringleader.

12:10.673 --> 12:14.041
These lemmings
don't have minds of their own.

12:14.216 --> 12:17.418
- She's right, Sam.
- Sad but true, Sammy.

12:17.592 --> 12:21.339
- She is not.
- Whatever you say, boss.

12:21.510 --> 12:25.803
Would you guys... Come on.
You're overreacting here, Diane.

12:25.971 --> 12:30.795
lt's a harmless little prank, that's all.
All guys fall for it. lt's fun.

12:31.890 --> 12:34.759
- Did you ever fall for it?
- Not personally.

12:34.933 --> 12:38.466
But a lot of my friends have
and did they have a terrific time.

12:38.643 --> 12:42.769
- You have to be a certain kind of guy.
- Yeah, a real dink.

12:43.770 --> 12:48.513
Thanks a lot, Carla. Come on,
Frasier's got a sense of humour.

12:48.690 --> 12:52.850
l bet he's up in the woods right now
laughing himself silly.

12:53.942 --> 12:56.396
l am sure that he is not.

12:58.109 --> 13:03.730
Like many who enter the psychiatric
profession, Frasier is a trusting man.

13:03.903 --> 13:08.314
You took advantage of his trust.
He turned to you for a day of relaxation

13:08.489 --> 13:10.564
and instead you gave him this -

13:10.740 --> 13:13.526
a cruel, malicious, moronic prank.

13:13.699 --> 13:18.821
A good-natured, fun,
character-building, moronic prank.

13:19.910 --> 13:23.987
lf there's any decency among you,
you'll go back and find him.

13:29.164 --> 13:34.404
- l'll go.
- Thank you for that flash of humanity.

13:34.582 --> 13:36.788
l can't believe this.

13:44.671 --> 13:47.919
l'm furious
with all of you for what you did.

13:48.089 --> 13:50.294
Frasier, l can explain.

13:50.465 --> 13:54.460
Why did you introduce me to that sport?
l'm hooked on it.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.761
l was hoping you'd come back here
and l want to apologise.

14:11.932 --> 14:16.176
After a couple of hours in the position,
l heard some snipe in the bush,

14:16.351 --> 14:20.298
so l went off to pursue them
and l got lost in the woods.

14:20.476 --> 14:24.603
l scrambled about for a while
until l heard the sound of cars.

14:24.770 --> 14:28.433
So l flagged down an eighteen-wheeler
and made my way back.

14:28.606 --> 14:34.687
Good friends, l'm sorry. l let you down.
lt's the last thing l wanted to do.

14:34.858 --> 14:40.560
- Frasier, are you sure you're all right?
- Diane, l'm aglow. l'm transported.

14:40.735 --> 14:45.892
l don't expect you to understand.
lt has to do with the bond between men.

14:46.989 --> 14:52.026
Sorry. Coach, set up my buddies. l want
to drink to the camaraderie of this night.

14:52.198 --> 14:57.356
- You don't have to do that, Frasier.
- Come on, what the hell?

14:58.451 --> 15:03.075
- lt is the bagger's prerogative.
- Marvellous tradition. Let's drink to it.

15:03.244 --> 15:07.454
May l have a word in private?
lt's about what happened tonight.

15:07.621 --> 15:10.075
You're interfering with male bonding.

15:12.291 --> 15:15.704
To snipe hunting.
The most humane of sports.

15:15.876 --> 15:19.455
No guns. No knives.
Just a man and a plain simple bag.

15:19.626 --> 15:22.376
Like you and Diane.

15:25.087 --> 15:28.454
Come on. Guys make jokes
about their mates, right?

15:30.547 --> 15:32.623
You probably think l'm being manic,

15:32.799 --> 15:37.257
but l haven't spent that much time out
of doors in my life. l was exhilarated.

15:37.425 --> 15:43.258
lt was a revelation to me how quiet it
was. l heard an owl for the first time.

15:43.428 --> 15:48.882
l finally understand why guys get hung up
on going to the woods - camping, fishing.

15:49.055 --> 15:54.509
Wait until you come home with a snipe
strapped to the hood of your car?

15:56.849 --> 15:59.765
That's a thrill of a lifetime.

15:59.934 --> 16:03.634
My one regret is we didn't get
a snipe. lt's all my fault.

16:03.811 --> 16:07.641
- l let you guys down.
- No, you didn't disappoint us.

16:07.813 --> 16:11.476
lf there's one thing you didn't do,
it was disappoint us.

16:11.648 --> 16:18.264
l think it's time that we told you a little
something here. The fellas and l...

16:18.442 --> 16:21.940
l hate to interrupt,
but you should go freshen up.

16:22.111 --> 16:25.145
You're right, Diane. l'm filthy.

16:28.113 --> 16:34.030
l want to thank all of you
for caring enough to include me tonight.

16:39.534 --> 16:43.861
l don't believe it.
That guy is a bigger boob than Cliff.

16:45.662 --> 16:47.700
No argument here.

16:49.122 --> 16:51.280
What was the problem there?

16:51.456 --> 16:54.989
- l was just going to tell him the truth.
- Do you have to?

16:55.166 --> 16:58.746
What's the good
if you can't laugh in his face about it?

16:59.960 --> 17:04.867
Listen to me. This may be hard for you
to understand, most things are,

17:05.963 --> 17:11.628
but finding out that he was the butt
of your joke would be devastating.

17:11.799 --> 17:15.212
He's always been the odd-man-out.

17:15.382 --> 17:20.919
The kids would choose up sides for
softball, he was the last one picked.

17:21.094 --> 17:23.713
''You take the girl, we'll take Frasier.''

17:24.845 --> 17:28.627
Yeah, l remember. l always used
to feel sorry for those guys.

17:28.805 --> 17:31.639
Even when l was doing it to them.

17:31.807 --> 17:38.090
Yeah, Frasier was lucky. Some children
were laughed off the playground entirely.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.886
- Not me. l was always out there.
- And you still are.

17:45.896 --> 17:51.135
Maybe l'm just lucky, but nothing like that
ever really happened to me.

17:51.315 --> 17:53.353
No. Wait a minute, Sam.

17:53.524 --> 17:59.559
When l told you that you weren't invited
to the Red Sox alumni dinner this year?

17:59.734 --> 18:02.307
l wasn't invited to the alumni dinner?

18:03.819 --> 18:07.732
No, what am l talking about?
They're not even having a dinner.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.275
But while l'm thinking about it,
can l have Saturday night off?

18:12.448 --> 18:16.147
- What for?
- Death in the family.

18:16.325 --> 18:18.151
Sure.

18:20.743 --> 18:25.367
Come on. We got to tell Frasier.
You're holding up the laugh fest?

18:25.537 --> 18:29.828
We don't have to tell Frasier
and we're not going to ever.

18:29.997 --> 18:34.288
- Then why did we do it?
- You're obviously bored with lip diddling.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.205
He's going to find out eventually.

18:39.376 --> 18:43.501
We should be the ones to tell him
because we did the hard work.

18:43.669 --> 18:49.253
He might not find out.
Frasier isn't an outdoorsman.

18:49.421 --> 18:55.124
lf he should find out about it years later,
he'll be able to laugh about it.

18:55.299 --> 18:58.880
Especially if some or all of you are dead.

19:00.676 --> 19:04.008
- That isn't asking much, is it?
- Well, actually l...

19:04.178 --> 19:06.751
- Sam.
- What?

19:06.929 --> 19:10.094
There's one other thing
l want you to know.

19:11.139 --> 19:13.973
Lord knows why, but...

19:16.224 --> 19:19.224
...Frasier thinks of you as a friend.

19:19.393 --> 19:23.768
As a matter of fact, he thinks of you
as one of his closest friends.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.804
- Get out of here.
- He does, Sam.

19:30.397 --> 19:34.309
Jeez, what a boo...boo...
<i>bootiful</i> guy he is.

19:35.733 --> 19:38.601
All right. We'll do it your way.

19:38.776 --> 19:42.107
Fellas, nobody tells Frasier
the truth, OK?

19:44.904 --> 19:49.147
Well, it's a stupid oversight. lf Sam
Malone isn't invited, l'm not coming.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.440
l'm kidding. l'll be there. Eight o'clock.

19:55.533 --> 19:57.571
Wrong number.

19:57.742 --> 20:02.650
Thank you, everyone. Believe me,
it's best to let this matter drop.

20:02.827 --> 20:06.609
No need for Frasier
to suffer any embarrassment.

20:06.788 --> 20:12.952
''Let the matter drop.'' l deserted and
now l need a woman to plead my case.

20:13.124 --> 20:19.869
lf you feel that strong about it, maybe,
we could take another shot at it.

20:21.501 --> 20:23.577
You'd do that for me?

20:23.753 --> 20:27.001
Yeah, you bet we would.

20:28.796 --> 20:32.874
- Fine. Well, let's get back out there.
- Out where?

20:33.048 --> 20:36.296
- ln the wilds where the snipe run free.
- No.

20:36.466 --> 20:39.548
l looked in the mirror.
Do you know what l saw?

20:39.717 --> 20:43.001
A quitter.
A man who lets his buddies down.

20:43.178 --> 20:45.631
l want to prove myself.

20:45.804 --> 20:51.043
Well, hear that guys? Looks like Frasier
wants to go back out there tonight.

20:51.221 --> 20:54.471
Absolutely. Tonight is
the night of the full moon.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.593
Sam told me the snipe run best
when it's a full moon.

20:59.267 --> 21:01.306
- l said that.
- That's right.

21:01.476 --> 21:05.175
- And they'd be running all night, right?
- l said that, too.

21:05.352 --> 21:09.893
- Well, then what are we waiting for?
- Nothing. Let's get out of here.

21:10.064 --> 21:17.106
You're the first bagger l ever met to go
snipe hunting twice in the same night.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.681
You're going to go down in the annals.

21:21.235 --> 21:23.274
Sam, please.

21:23.444 --> 21:28.518
Thanks for making us promise not to tell
him. So we give him a double whammy.

21:28.697 --> 21:31.233
Frasier,
l need a moment alone with you.

21:31.406 --> 21:35.235
- Can't this wait?
- We're feeling the thrill of the hunt.

21:35.408 --> 21:38.276
- Yeah, so does Frasier.
- Frasier...

21:40.451 --> 21:42.074
Women.

21:42.243 --> 21:45.990
l guess she wants to kiss me.
You have to indulge them.

21:46.162 --> 21:50.952
- Dames.
- That is why l don't have a girlfriend.

21:51.123 --> 21:53.742
Reason number 27.

21:57.834 --> 22:02.409
Frasier, sometimes people do
thoughtless things.

22:03.377 --> 22:06.874
They don't mean any harm.
They just don't know any better.

22:07.045 --> 22:11.669
You sound like the psychologist l had
at eight. What are you trying to say?

22:14.424 --> 22:17.458
They played a childish prank on you.

22:17.633 --> 22:21.249
- l know that.
- What?

22:21.426 --> 22:27.628
A man does not crouch in the woods for
hours without having a revelation or two.

22:30.431 --> 22:34.260
So this is part of a plan
and l unwittingly helped you?

22:35.349 --> 22:37.175
Yes.

22:37.350 --> 22:42.803
Frasier, how devious.
But why didn't you tell me?

22:42.977 --> 22:48.217
- You'd have thought it was too cruel.
- Are you kidding? l would've helped.

22:48.396 --> 22:51.893
- This is so unlike you.
- But it's what guys do.

22:52.063 --> 22:55.146
We screw each other to the wall.

22:56.233 --> 22:59.516
Boy, it's great to be one of the gang,
l'll tell you.

22:59.693 --> 23:03.901
When we get up to that clearing, l'm
going to get them to pose for a photo.

23:04.069 --> 23:07.650
After they disappear into the woods
l'm going to rush drive back

23:07.821 --> 23:10.654
and make you
one of my famous omelettes.

23:10.822 --> 23:17.437
- Frasier, l find your cunning arousing.
- Well, that's what it's there for, baby.

23:19.576 --> 23:21.946
l've got to share this with the troops.

23:22.910 --> 23:24.534
Men.

23:24.702 --> 23:27.371
You're not going to believe this but

23:27.538 --> 23:32.077
Diane just attempted to tell me
that there's no such thing as a snipe.

23:34.290 --> 23:39.447
They will say anything to keep me
at home. You will not be a snipe widow.

23:39.626 --> 23:43.702
All right now, men. Let's go get one.
To the woods.

23:50.006 --> 23:55.672
l'm sorry, but in years to come we're
going to have a good laugh over this.

23:56.591 --> 24:01.132
- Not all of us will be laughing.
- You'll see. Trust me.

24:03.301 --> 24:08.210
- Hey, look, it's starting to snow.
- Don't worry, the colder the better.
