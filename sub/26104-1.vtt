I gotta add a body
to this run.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.479
We finished fitting out
the prospect?

02:49.512 --> 02:52.248
Yeah. It all checks out.

02:52.282 --> 02:54.116
Cop ended up being dirty.

02:54.149 --> 02:56.519
DA shaved off six years.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.554
Did his probie time
in Hollister.

02:58.588 --> 03:00.055
No red flags.

03:01.190 --> 03:03.659
I like the kid. He's smart.

03:09.432 --> 03:10.666
Angel.

03:15.505 --> 03:16.939
Where's your prospect?

03:16.972 --> 03:18.441
He went to see our old man.

03:19.409 --> 03:21.277
Need him on this Vegas run.

03:21.977 --> 03:23.646
Protection?

03:23.679 --> 03:25.481
Think he's ready?

03:25.515 --> 03:26.716
Yeah.

Oh, my God.

04:53.436 --> 04:56.005
-When did you--
-I had a break before finals.

04:56.038 --> 04:58.140
I missed you
so fucking much.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.243
-A few more weeks, baby.
-I know.

05:01.276 --> 05:03.646
I cannot wait to
get out of here.

06:01.771 --> 06:04.306
Longest fucking short stories
I ever read.

06:07.009 --> 06:08.478
His poems are my favorite.

06:11.447 --> 06:12.582
Gracias, Pop.

06:25.528 --> 06:27.162
Yeah.

06:45.481 --> 06:47.316
Time to go, Prospect.

06:49.384 --> 06:51.120
I got him, Pop.

06:53.589 --> 06:55.390
Getting called up, carnan.

06:55.424 --> 06:57.126
Need you on this Vegas run.

06:58.393 --> 06:59.862
Dresses?

06:59.895 --> 07:01.864
-Yeah.

07:01.897 --> 07:03.432
Whatever the club needs.

07:10.272 --> 07:12.742
Yo, he ever talk to you?

07:12.775 --> 07:14.844
About Mom or any of that?

07:18.013 --> 07:20.115
No. Not really.

07:21.617 --> 07:22.818
Has he with you?

07:24.219 --> 07:25.387
Baseball.

07:28.023 --> 07:30.893
That's the only thing
we ever talk about.

07:30.926 --> 07:33.062
For eight years,
not a word about that day.

So who was it?

15:03.912 --> 15:05.480
Don't know.

15:05.514 --> 15:07.116
They were pros.

15:09.184 --> 15:10.852
Well.

15:10.885 --> 15:14.489
At least we didn't lose
2.4 million in product

15:14.523 --> 15:15.924
to a bunch of amateurs.

15:17.159 --> 15:19.194
CREEPER: They ambushed us.

15:19.228 --> 15:20.429
Sir.

15:21.896 --> 15:24.133
Came out of nowhere.

15:27.569 --> 15:29.304
We change route...

15:29.338 --> 15:31.106
vehicle...

15:31.140 --> 15:32.641
time and day...

15:32.674 --> 15:34.209
every run is different.

15:35.710 --> 15:37.246
So...

15:37.279 --> 15:39.481
they came out of somewhere,

15:39.514 --> 15:43.352
and someone
gave them the details.

15:44.186 --> 15:46.121
No one in my club.

15:46.155 --> 15:49.324
Implying I'm the one
foolish enough...

15:49.358 --> 15:51.293
to employ a traitor?

15:51.326 --> 15:52.361
Hmm.

15:54.396 --> 15:56.765
EZ: The guy holding Gilly
was dark-skinned.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.435
Ink on his arm.

16:01.870 --> 16:04.806
It looked like, uh...

16:04.839 --> 16:07.842
tribal letters.

16:07.876 --> 16:09.344
B-T-T.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.482
He remembers shit.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.117
Had guns at our heads.

16:15.150 --> 16:16.818
Who knows what the hell he saw?

16:16.851 --> 16:19.288
The prospect.

16:19.321 --> 16:22.257
B-T-T. Base Town Tribe.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.194
Samoan gang out of
San Bernardino.

16:25.227 --> 16:27.862
Didn't some of them do time
killing Haji?

16:27.896 --> 16:30.799
Fallujah. Rival company
and crazy as fuck.

16:30.832 --> 16:33.068
Tribe moves a little weed
and pussy but...

16:33.102 --> 16:35.304
jumping us for chiva
makes no sense.

16:35.337 --> 16:37.106
-They gotta be hired guns.
GALINDO: Yes.

16:37.139 --> 16:38.873
But for whom?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.946
Bring me the shot caller.

16:44.979 --> 16:47.082
-We'll get the truth.

16:47.116 --> 16:49.084
We're not your muscle.

16:49.118 --> 16:50.719
Your mercs can track down
the Samoan.

16:50.752 --> 16:52.654
But your job was
to protect my shipment.

16:52.687 --> 16:54.889
You failed to do that.

16:54.923 --> 16:57.592
Now the Chinese
are out 12 keys.

16:57.626 --> 17:00.895
Running protection for other
buyers was never our deal.

17:00.929 --> 17:02.597
Told Alvarez we'd cover you

17:02.631 --> 17:05.032
till you had the manpower
north of the fence.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.968
The only fucking reason
we're doing it

17:07.001 --> 17:09.037
-is to help you out.
-No.

17:10.972 --> 17:14.742
The only fucking reason
you're doing it

17:14.776 --> 17:16.911
is because I pay you
a lot of money.

17:16.944 --> 17:19.614
Now you and your club

17:19.647 --> 17:21.049
are responsible for the loss.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.252
That's the way it works,
El Presidente.

17:26.621 --> 17:27.989
So...

17:28.021 --> 17:30.592
if there's not
a forthright Samoan

17:30.625 --> 17:33.595
in my church pew
by end of day tomorrow,

17:33.628 --> 17:36.598
I'm afraid it will have to be
a Mayan in his place.

18:00.422 --> 18:02.591
You don't speak
unless we tell you to.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.494
I don't give a shit
what you remember.

18:05.527 --> 18:07.429
Educate your prospect.

18:12.234 --> 18:14.035
Take Creeper to the dock.

18:14.068 --> 18:16.705
Hurry back.
El Padrino's on his way.

18:16.738 --> 18:17.906
Okay.

Ugh.

What's he saying?

21:10.745 --> 21:12.481
Tell him I'm an LA Mexican.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.452
Make sure he knows
what the hell he's doing.

21:21.923 --> 21:23.558

21:32.967 --> 21:34.369
Jesus.

21:34.403 --> 21:36.070
Always got to make it weird,
don't you?

21:37.639 --> 21:39.240
What are you guys
talking about?

21:41.810 --> 21:44.345
Huh

21:45.580 --> 21:47.916
Why are they laughing?
What?

25:25.667 --> 25:27.769
* They call me daddy

25:27.802 --> 25:29.771
* I'm the daddy

25:29.804 --> 25:32.440
* I'm daddy rollin' stone

25:32.473 --> 25:35.243
*

25:35.276 --> 25:38.747
* Have my fun in the morning

25:38.780 --> 25:42.684
* I have my fun at night

25:42.717 --> 25:46.087
* Have my fun anytime I want

25:46.120 --> 25:49.390
* And anytime I have it,
it's right *

25:49.423 --> 25:53.261
* I'm the daddy

25:53.294 --> 25:56.998
* Daddy roller

25:57.031 --> 25:59.567
* They call me daddy

25:59.600 --> 26:00.969
* I'm the daddy

26:01.002 --> 26:04.005
* I'm daddy rollin' stone

26:04.038 --> 26:06.340
*

26:06.374 --> 26:10.178
* Girls call my friend
Big John *

26:10.211 --> 26:14.115
* He's big as he can be

26:14.148 --> 26:17.151
* Big John may be
twice my size *

26:17.185 --> 26:18.920
-Padrino.

26:18.953 --> 26:21.322
It's good to see you.
Come on in.

26:21.355 --> 26:24.558
* I'm the daddy

26:24.592 --> 26:28.196
* Daddy roller

26:28.229 --> 26:30.564
* They call me daddy

26:30.598 --> 26:32.233
* I'm the daddy

26:32.266 --> 26:35.036
* I'm daddy rollin' stone

26:35.069 --> 26:36.370
*

26:36.404 --> 26:38.339
Padrino.

26:38.372 --> 26:40.008
Primo.

26:40.041 --> 26:46.948
*

26:58.727 --> 27:05.633
*

27:18.212 --> 27:20.114
Where's Gilly headed?

27:20.148 --> 27:21.716
Looks like north.

27:24.018 --> 27:25.519
COCO: Recycle.

27:53.681 --> 27:55.850
EMILY: I drive up here
every week.

27:55.884 --> 27:57.118
I know.

28:00.221 --> 28:02.056
Well, I don't know shit.

28:02.090 --> 28:05.526
I would sit here for hours,
just waiting.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.896
Until some guard
would send me home.

28:07.929 --> 28:09.530
No explanation.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.265
No calls.
You don't answer my letters.

28:11.299 --> 28:13.201
I thought some--

28:13.234 --> 28:14.903
I thought maybe
you were hurt.

28:15.804 --> 28:18.006
-I'm sorry.
-Well, fuck sorry.

28:18.039 --> 28:19.307
Why wouldn't you see me?

28:20.641 --> 28:22.576
I'm looking at 20 years, Em.

28:24.012 --> 28:25.346
My life is done.

28:29.183 --> 28:30.451
Seeing you is...

28:33.354 --> 28:36.490
Seeing you is trying to hold on
to some kind of future.

28:39.327 --> 28:40.628
It's bullshit.

28:44.632 --> 28:46.034
Hope is cruel.

28:52.206 --> 28:53.507
Are we done?

28:55.409 --> 28:57.711
That's it?

28:57.745 --> 29:01.082
Three years all bullshit?

29:11.425 --> 29:14.863
You made that decision
for both of us.

29:23.504 --> 29:25.874
So then I have to make
this one.

29:28.943 --> 29:30.879
Oh, my God.
Wait.

29:30.912 --> 29:32.780
-Emily! Emily!
-Hey, man, sit down!

29:32.813 --> 29:34.515
Emily, wait! Emily!

29:34.548 --> 29:36.084
Emily!

29:36.117 --> 29:37.418
-Emily!
-Don't be stupid!

29:37.451 --> 29:39.220
-Reyes! Reyes, calm down!
-Emily, wait!

29:39.253 --> 29:40.354
Get him out of here.

29:40.388 --> 29:42.156
On the ground!

29:42.190 --> 29:44.525
Settle down. That's enough!

29:44.558 --> 29:45.960
Emily, wait! Emily!

29:45.994 --> 29:48.329
-Come on!
-Emily!

29:48.362 --> 29:49.463
Emily!

29:49.497 --> 29:51.099
WOMAN: Assholes.

29:58.539 --> 30:05.413
*

30:37.511 --> 30:39.780
-Padrino.
-Angel.

30:39.813 --> 30:42.783
Good to see you, brother.

30:42.816 --> 30:44.118
Hola, el Coco.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.621
Where's Gilly?

30:47.655 --> 30:49.323
Stayed on the other side.

30:49.357 --> 30:51.725
Sticking around till Creeper's
out of the woods.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.829
El hermano menor.

30:55.863 --> 30:57.966
The new prospect.

30:57.999 --> 30:59.300
EZ.

31:03.804 --> 31:05.974
Gas it up and detail it.

31:06.007 --> 31:09.043
I don't want to see
a speck of dust, huh?

31:09.077 --> 31:10.644
And my guys too.

31:14.015 --> 31:15.283
Yes, sir.

31:24.458 --> 31:31.332
*

31:56.991 --> 32:03.864
*

32:10.804 --> 32:17.678
*

32:43.437 --> 32:45.239
TAZA: We risk a serious
conflict in Berdoo

32:45.273 --> 32:48.242
because the prospect thinks
he saw some ink.

32:48.276 --> 32:50.211
RIZ: Your brother.

32:50.244 --> 32:52.313
Is that memory shit for real?

32:52.346 --> 32:53.881
Been that way
since he was a kid.

32:53.914 --> 32:55.483
BISHOP: Eh, real or not,

32:55.516 --> 32:56.984
delivering the Samoan
to Galindo

32:57.017 --> 32:58.452
gives him someone to hurt.

32:58.486 --> 33:01.222
What happens if we can't
track down the Samoan?

33:02.123 --> 33:04.225
The cartel will never lay hands
on a Mayan.

33:05.093 --> 33:07.061
We got ourselves
in deep, brother.

33:07.961 --> 33:09.463
What's our pushback?

33:09.497 --> 33:11.799
Galindo thinks
he fucking owns us.

33:11.832 --> 33:13.567
I'm aware.

33:13.601 --> 33:14.868
ALVAREZ: Brothers...

33:16.537 --> 33:18.772
Let's stay focused
on the task at hand.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.409
How do we move on Base Town?

33:22.042 --> 33:24.745
Little Samoa's
on the east side.

33:24.778 --> 33:27.615
Tribe runs Base Line to 9th.
It's a DMZ.

33:27.648 --> 33:30.384
PD only show up
to count bodies.

33:30.418 --> 33:33.487
They HQ from the old
Núñez Cemetery.

33:33.521 --> 33:36.224
Shot caller is a guy
named Afa.

33:36.257 --> 33:38.559
Big old 6x6 motherfucker.

33:38.592 --> 33:41.195
Soon as we exit the 10,
street's gonna light up.

33:41.229 --> 33:43.231
Samoans will know we're coming.

33:43.264 --> 33:45.766
At best, it's unfriendly.

33:45.799 --> 33:47.535
Or lambs to the slaughter.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.575
Can you give Packer a call,

33:54.608 --> 33:57.077
have Sam Dino back us up?

33:57.111 --> 33:58.546
Done.

34:14.728 --> 34:21.601
*

34:27.241 --> 34:29.377
-There you go.

34:35.748 --> 34:37.016
WOMAN: Gracias.

34:37.050 --> 34:39.487
How's the flank today?

34:39.520 --> 34:41.121
I got one piece.

34:41.155 --> 34:44.391
It's--could be a couple steaks.
You want it?

34:44.425 --> 34:45.993
Sounds good.

34:51.399 --> 34:57.905
*

35:09.850 --> 35:12.119
Be $9 even.

35:16.023 --> 35:17.725
Here's ten.

35:17.758 --> 35:19.360
I'll get you some change.

35:19.393 --> 35:20.494
Keep it.

35:38.145 --> 35:44.585
*

35:55.596 --> 36:01.635
*

37:03.464 --> 37:05.966
AFA: You're in the wrong hood.

37:05.999 --> 37:08.168
Mayans, you got
no business here.

37:08.201 --> 37:09.403
BISHOP: Yeah, come on, Afa.

37:09.437 --> 37:11.939
You stole from the cartel.

37:11.972 --> 37:13.374
There's no out.

37:13.407 --> 37:14.775
If we leave,

37:14.808 --> 37:16.444
Galindo sends
his Mexican mercs.

37:16.477 --> 37:19.413
They'll gun down every Samoan
in Base Town.

37:19.447 --> 37:20.881
You want that blood
on your hands?

37:20.914 --> 37:23.083
BISHOP: Now give us back
what you took.

37:23.116 --> 37:27.287
Tell Galindo who hired you, we
stop the bodies from dropping.

37:38.966 --> 37:41.201
I don't see taillights
in two minutes,

37:41.234 --> 37:42.970
there'll be Mayan bodies
dropping.

37:49.877 --> 37:51.445
Twelve on seven.

37:55.282 --> 37:56.584
Yeah, okay.

38:05.959 --> 38:08.128
Behind you!

38:15.302 --> 38:16.637
Go! Go, go, go!

38:25.779 --> 38:27.247
Here we go.

38:41.128 --> 38:42.863
Stay on 'em!

38:49.369 --> 38:51.038
Shit.

38:51.071 --> 38:53.674
God damn it, Coco!
We need Afa alive!

38:53.707 --> 38:55.476
My bad.

39:02.550 --> 39:03.551
Angel!

39:05.486 --> 39:06.987
Help him out!

39:17.898 --> 39:19.600
-Get 'em!

39:28.442 --> 39:30.911
Hey, guys.
It's going down.

39:36.049 --> 39:37.885
Fuck!

39:37.918 --> 39:39.186
Let's get out of here.

39:44.357 --> 39:46.193
Lift your leg!

39:50.898 --> 39:52.700
We're gonna lose Afa
in Base Town.

39:56.570 --> 39:57.605
Hey, Bishop!

39:57.638 --> 39:59.206
Reaper has landed.

40:05.245 --> 40:12.119
*

40:38.512 --> 40:39.747
Gun.

40:43.283 --> 40:46.486
Well, boys, looks like
we got us a Samoan sandwich.

40:47.888 --> 40:49.322
Two tons of dark meat

40:49.356 --> 40:51.892
jammed between
a stack of tortillas

40:51.925 --> 40:53.827
and a loaf of white bread.

40:59.399 --> 41:00.834
Appreciate
the help, brother.

41:01.702 --> 41:03.637
Anytime, amigo.

41:15.716 --> 41:17.551
GALINDO: You ever meet her?

41:17.585 --> 41:19.653
AFA: Never in person.

41:19.687 --> 41:22.856
She'd give us a call or a text.

41:22.890 --> 41:26.093
-Gave us a drop point.

41:26.126 --> 41:28.095
Indio Quarry.

41:28.128 --> 41:32.099
We used proxies to drop off
the drugs, pick up the cash.

41:32.132 --> 41:34.234
Never saw a face.

41:34.267 --> 41:35.335
No names.

41:38.471 --> 41:40.407
GALINDO: Found this
in your Jeep.

41:43.844 --> 41:45.145
Payment?

41:51.051 --> 41:53.120
AFA: She didn't tell us
it was the cartel.

41:53.153 --> 41:54.487
I swear.

41:54.521 --> 41:57.357
Was she American?

41:57.390 --> 42:01.161
No. Spoke English, but...

42:01.194 --> 42:04.297
she was Latina, I think.

42:04.331 --> 42:08.201
Young. She sounded young.

42:08.235 --> 42:10.403
How'd she know about
the shipment?

42:10.437 --> 42:12.105
I don't know.

42:15.175 --> 42:16.376
Mm.

42:20.213 --> 42:23.583
I believe you, Afa.
I do.

42:23.617 --> 42:27.988
I know you're too smart to
knowingly steal from me, but...

42:28.021 --> 42:29.389
you did.

42:29.422 --> 42:31.859
Now you owe me.

42:31.892 --> 42:33.526
You understand that, yes?

42:35.863 --> 42:37.464
So...

42:37.497 --> 42:39.466
what I need from you

42:39.499 --> 42:41.702
is the identity of this woman

42:41.735 --> 42:44.037
and where it is
I might find her.

42:44.071 --> 42:46.173
I didn't ask.

42:46.206 --> 42:49.076
I didn't ask who.
Where.

42:50.310 --> 42:52.045
I didn't ask.

42:54.481 --> 42:56.449
I worry about you, my friend.

42:56.483 --> 42:58.018
Your health.

42:58.051 --> 43:02.555
You really need to take
better care of yourself.

43:40.961 --> 43:43.530
It's a very unpleasant way
to lose weight.

43:44.765 --> 43:46.333
Is there anything
you can remember?

43:46.366 --> 43:49.136
Might save you from...

43:49.169 --> 43:50.771
dropping another 40.

43:58.946 --> 44:00.948
She said something...

44:03.784 --> 44:06.019
Something about...

44:06.053 --> 44:09.022
helping the devil.

44:09.056 --> 44:10.958
Diablo.

44:10.991 --> 44:12.392
Mexico.

44:14.127 --> 44:15.863
She said it in Spanish.

44:17.731 --> 44:18.966
Diablo.

44:21.268 --> 44:23.703
Muerto El Diablo,
resucita México?

44:26.974 --> 44:28.341
Sounds like it.

44:33.480 --> 44:36.116
Kill the devil,
resurrect Mexico.

44:37.450 --> 44:39.719
It was the rebels.

44:39.753 --> 44:41.188
Los Olvidados.

44:42.489 --> 44:44.892
From tagging walls
to jacking weight?

44:44.925 --> 44:46.559
That's a step up.

44:49.129 --> 44:50.964
Now they're on my border.

45:05.145 --> 45:06.546
Marcus.

45:28.768 --> 45:31.839
Find the girl.
Find my dresses.

45:31.872 --> 45:35.943
We need to extract
these indigenous tics.

45:35.976 --> 45:39.679
Expose the traitor
in our midst.

45:39.712 --> 45:42.850
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm running late.

45:42.883 --> 45:45.252
Dinner with my family.

46:01.368 --> 46:03.536
Streets know
we were in Base Town.

46:03.570 --> 46:05.205
We gotta dump him
on the other side.

46:07.807 --> 46:09.176
Take your prospect.

46:09.209 --> 46:11.011
Coco and Gilly
can handle it.

46:11.044 --> 46:14.314
Little brother has seen
a lot the last 48.

46:14.347 --> 46:16.649
Held his own.

46:16.683 --> 46:18.986
Make sure he can
follow through.

46:32.799 --> 46:34.968
EZ: Los Olvidados.

46:35.002 --> 46:38.171
Yeah, the Forgotten Ones.

46:38.205 --> 46:40.607
Orphans by the hand
of the cartel.

46:43.610 --> 46:46.379
Abandoned kids
of the slaughtered.

46:46.413 --> 46:47.915
Help him out.

47:05.465 --> 47:07.467
-My bad.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.202
EZ: Shit.

47:09.236 --> 47:11.504
-Cellophane.

47:11.538 --> 47:13.540
-Wrap him up.

47:13.573 --> 47:15.943
Keep him fresh.
It'll taste better.

47:31.758 --> 47:34.027
Hey, Pop.

47:34.061 --> 47:35.395
Yeah.

47:37.931 --> 47:38.999
You okay?

47:43.070 --> 47:44.837
Yeah, all right.

47:44.871 --> 47:47.440
I just...gotta wrap
some shit up.

47:58.118 --> 48:00.887
*

48:03.823 --> 48:10.730
*

48:12.532 --> 48:15.235
Come here.
Come here.

48:18.738 --> 48:20.740
Sorry I'm late.

48:20.773 --> 48:22.542
Someone was too hungry
to wait.

48:40.893 --> 48:42.362
Gracias.

48:42.395 --> 48:43.663
Maria, por favor.

48:45.798 --> 48:47.167
-Gracias.
-De nada.

48:53.506 --> 48:55.175
Such a lucky papa.

48:55.808 --> 48:57.644
Yes, you are.

48:57.677 --> 49:04.551
*

49:20.700 --> 49:21.834
What's going on?

49:23.970 --> 49:25.372
Need to see you.

49:32.979 --> 49:35.348
JIMENEZ: They don't waste
an ounce, do they?

49:36.983 --> 49:39.018
The cows.

49:39.052 --> 49:40.553
They use every part.

49:47.094 --> 49:49.062
Thought we never meet
face-to-face.

49:49.096 --> 49:50.330
This couldn't wait.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.903
Need to know what happened
out on the 111 yesterday.

49:58.238 --> 49:59.939
-We got jacked.

50:01.941 --> 50:04.477
Club's still trying
to figure it out.

50:04.511 --> 50:05.845
Samoans?

50:07.480 --> 50:10.250
Nothing goes down on the street
that I don't hear about.

50:12.018 --> 50:14.854
This only works
if I can trust you, EZ.

50:19.092 --> 50:21.261
Base Town Tribe
did the heist.

50:21.294 --> 50:22.995
We tracked down
the shot caller.

50:23.029 --> 50:25.132
The rebels hired them.
Los Olvidados.

50:27.334 --> 50:28.868
Samoans give up any names?

50:28.901 --> 50:30.937
Hell no.

50:30.970 --> 50:33.406
But you know
El Padrino's in town.

50:33.440 --> 50:35.442
Did Galindo play
the daddy card?

50:36.909 --> 50:39.045
Bring Alvarez down
to handle the clusterfuck?

50:39.078 --> 50:41.481
-I'm not at the table.
-Right.

50:41.514 --> 50:43.015
But you're moving up.

50:44.651 --> 50:46.553
Lot faster than I imagined.

50:48.188 --> 50:49.822
I hope you're keeping
your head straight.

50:50.990 --> 50:53.160
Hey, you point that level
of concern at my old man.

50:53.193 --> 50:54.994
He's the one carrying
the weight of this.

50:56.363 --> 50:58.131
And no more secret
meat locker chats.

50:58.165 --> 50:59.932
You don't get
to make that call.

51:01.734 --> 51:03.470
Shit happens.
Players change.

51:05.172 --> 51:07.340
There's no formula here.

51:07.374 --> 51:08.608
Gotta stay fluid.

51:08.641 --> 51:10.076
What the fuck does that mean?

51:10.109 --> 51:11.578
My deal doesn't change.

51:11.611 --> 51:13.880
You killed a cop.
Your deal was a gift.

51:15.748 --> 51:17.850
And I'm the one
that made it happen.

51:17.884 --> 51:20.052
So if I say jump,
you say how high.

51:20.086 --> 51:21.221
Fuck you.

51:23.756 --> 51:25.825
You know what you
signed up for, cuz.

51:25.858 --> 51:27.026
Don't get cocky.

51:28.895 --> 51:30.730
And don't go making
any big plans.

51:30.763 --> 51:33.099
EZ: What I signed up for was
feeding you intel on Galindo.

51:33.132 --> 51:35.034
Only Galindo.

51:35.067 --> 51:37.370
My brother, the M.C.--
nothing touches them.

51:39.639 --> 51:42.074
And there's only one plan, cuz.

51:42.108 --> 51:44.277
The day the DEA has enough
to move on that cartel

51:44.311 --> 51:46.279
is the day that I walk away.

51:46.313 --> 51:48.215
From you, the M.C.,
this town, all of it.

51:48.248 --> 51:50.016
I get my fucking life back.

51:50.850 --> 51:52.885
And who took that life away?

51:57.390 --> 51:59.158
It's okay, Pop.
We're done.

52:04.564 --> 52:06.899
No spine.

52:06.933 --> 52:08.368
What?

52:08.401 --> 52:09.836
Cows.

52:09.869 --> 52:11.904
One thing you never use.
Spinal cord.

52:11.938 --> 52:14.073
Carries too much disease.

52:14.106 --> 52:15.575
So I rip it out.

52:57.650 --> 53:04.524
*

53:19.205 --> 53:21.007
Te quiero, mi hijo.

53:29.282 --> 53:31.484
What's in the pack, brother?

53:31.518 --> 53:33.119
-Jesus.

53:34.387 --> 53:35.688
My bad.

53:50.703 --> 53:52.339
I want to bring him in.

53:55.708 --> 53:57.109
My brother.

53:59.512 --> 54:02.281
You see what's been going down
the past couple days.

54:02.315 --> 54:03.916
He's fucking smart, man.

54:03.950 --> 54:06.986
He already knows we're working
something else.

54:07.019 --> 54:08.588
He can help.

54:08.621 --> 54:11.324
He's nine months shy
of a patch, carnan.

54:12.825 --> 54:14.260
I can't keep lying to him.

54:15.227 --> 54:16.596
It feels wrong.

54:17.764 --> 54:19.832
If he bends, that's on me.

54:22.034 --> 54:24.270
It's your call.

54:24.303 --> 54:25.505
Take a vote.

54:53.265 --> 54:55.635
We're gonna need the truck
to haul him out.

55:03.443 --> 55:04.744
You down with this?

55:04.777 --> 55:06.779
Bringing in the prospect?

55:06.813 --> 55:08.381
I get it.

55:08.415 --> 55:10.116
It's hard to play family.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.055
I say we trust him
till we don't.

55:37.143 --> 55:39.245
We hit a bump
in the road, primo.

55:39.278 --> 55:40.780
We'll get back on track.

55:43.282 --> 55:46.553
Not quite sure what track
that is, carnan.

55:48.054 --> 55:52.091
We set up this charter
to run and protect our heroin.

55:52.124 --> 55:55.127
Be the cartel's ally
on the border.

55:55.161 --> 55:57.163
It was smart.
Made us a lot of money.

55:58.330 --> 56:00.332
But you felt the tension
here today, no?

56:04.036 --> 56:06.272
Money's hooked us through
the fucking gills.

56:09.776 --> 56:12.512
Galindo, the old man,

56:12.545 --> 56:14.280
it was different with him.

56:14.313 --> 56:16.983
He understood the pride of men.

56:17.016 --> 56:18.585
His son does not.

56:24.624 --> 56:26.559
Sorry to interrupt,
gentlemen.

56:36.068 --> 56:38.805
We reached out to
our mordel inside Antidrogas.

56:38.838 --> 56:41.140
These fucking rebels have done
more damage to Galindo

56:41.173 --> 56:42.842
in the last six months

56:42.875 --> 56:45.344
than the Federales
in the last six years.

56:45.377 --> 56:47.780
HANK: Sabotaged two
communications towers,

56:47.814 --> 56:49.749
hacked in databases,
bank accounts,

56:49.782 --> 56:53.185
just last week raided a weapons
depot outside Hermosillo.

56:53.219 --> 56:55.488
Walked off
with a fucking arsenal.

56:55.522 --> 56:59.391
That's why Mr. Yellow Raincoat
got so wound up by Afa's intel.

56:59.425 --> 57:01.293
Los Olvidados have become
a real pebble

57:01.327 --> 57:03.563
in his baby seal-skinned
loafer.

57:10.737 --> 57:12.304
Start on our side.

57:12.338 --> 57:14.073
From the canal
to meth mountain.

57:14.106 --> 57:16.242
Turn over every pop yard,
squat house, and cum dump.

57:16.275 --> 57:18.010
We should take it
to the dealers.

57:18.044 --> 57:19.478
Dogwood Crew would be
the first to see

57:19.512 --> 57:21.447
-any change on the street.
-Yeah.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.283
Reach out to Louie
first thing in the morning.

57:24.316 --> 57:25.785
We'll stir shit up.

57:25.818 --> 57:27.286
Get 'em scared.

57:27.319 --> 57:29.255
Get 'em talking.

57:29.922 --> 57:32.324
Let's see if anyone knows
this rebel bitch.

58:09.095 --> 58:10.763
You want me to grab the body?

58:10.797 --> 58:12.298
Just come with us.

58:18.037 --> 58:24.711
*

58:44.731 --> 58:51.604
*

59:19.331 --> 59:21.433
Holy shit.

59:21.467 --> 59:28.340
*

01:00:04.977 --> 01:00:07.179
You may call me Adelita.

01:00:13.252 --> 01:00:15.321
EZ.

01:00:15.354 --> 01:00:17.256
Ezekiel.

01:00:17.289 --> 01:00:19.826
It's good to meet you,
Ezekiel.

01:00:19.859 --> 01:00:21.828
Thank you for your help.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.002
Come.

01:00:33.039 --> 01:00:39.912
*

01:00:52.224 --> 01:00:53.659
Do you have our package?

01:01:02.668 --> 01:01:04.403
ANGEL: All 12 keys.

01:01:07.406 --> 01:01:08.841
Thank you.

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:14.080
Galindo figured out
it was the Samoans.

01:01:14.113 --> 01:01:15.614
Got them to talk.

01:01:18.317 --> 01:01:20.086
He knows it was Los Olvidados.

01:01:21.353 --> 01:01:22.688
I'm sorry.

01:01:23.956 --> 01:01:26.358
It just unraveled.

01:01:26.392 --> 01:01:28.260
We couldn't shut it down.

01:01:29.695 --> 01:01:31.898
We knew that was a risk.

01:01:33.332 --> 01:01:35.567
He knows
you're at the border.

01:01:35.601 --> 01:01:36.903
And they'll flip over
every rock

01:01:36.936 --> 01:01:38.204
on both sides of the fence.

01:01:39.671 --> 01:01:41.273
Should head south.

01:01:41.307 --> 01:01:43.542
Just wait out in the mountains.

01:01:50.817 --> 01:01:51.851
ANGEL: Adelita.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.754
You have kids here.

01:02:32.424 --> 01:02:34.193
You're farther away
than usual.

01:02:35.761 --> 01:02:37.696
Something I should know?

01:02:37.729 --> 01:02:41.267
Just a few bumps
in the other world.

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.369
Love you.

01:02:43.402 --> 01:02:44.971
Love you too.

01:03:11.163 --> 01:03:17.803
*

01:03:40.292 --> 01:03:47.166
*

01:04:16.328 --> 01:04:18.030
You set up the heist
with the rebels?

01:04:18.064 --> 01:04:20.232
Jesus Christ, what the fuck
are you doing, Angel?

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.303
Los Olvidados,
the other vigilante groups,

01:04:24.336 --> 01:04:26.238
they're changing the game.

01:04:26.272 --> 01:04:29.075
Going ISIS on the cartels.

01:04:29.108 --> 01:04:31.810
Galindo will bend or break.

01:04:31.843 --> 01:04:33.512
If the Mayans want a future,

01:04:33.545 --> 01:04:35.014
we gotta be
in front of that change.

01:04:35.047 --> 01:04:37.049
And Adelita's the only way
to do that.

01:04:38.817 --> 01:04:40.419
You're the traitor.

01:04:43.522 --> 01:04:44.556
Am I?

01:04:46.325 --> 01:04:48.727
Galindo will keep throwing us
to the lions.

01:04:49.628 --> 01:04:51.697
Alvarez won't push back
because of a promise

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:54.100
he made to Galindo's old man.

01:04:54.133 --> 01:04:56.202
Bishop won't betray Alvarez.

01:04:56.235 --> 01:04:58.370
That shit is gonna bury us.

01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:03.175
I'm doing for the M.C.
what it can't do for itself.

01:05:05.811 --> 01:05:08.080
How long you been
sitting on this?

01:05:09.681 --> 01:05:10.782
Too long.

01:05:18.024 --> 01:05:19.925
Sorry, man.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.760
I'm in deep, little brother.

01:05:23.862 --> 01:05:26.798
Coco and Gilly,
they see where it's going.

01:05:26.832 --> 01:05:28.534
But it's on me.

01:05:28.567 --> 01:05:29.935
The play is mine.

01:05:31.703 --> 01:05:33.439
I wasn't gonna bring you
into this.

01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:34.573
Not yet.

01:05:36.008 --> 01:05:38.510
But I can't hide shit
from you, EZ.

01:05:38.544 --> 01:05:39.578
I never could.

01:05:42.114 --> 01:05:46.118
After what went down today,
I realized that I need you.

01:05:46.152 --> 01:05:48.220
Sangre es sangre.

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:55.761
You're the only one
I can really trust.

01:05:59.365 --> 01:06:00.732
I'm here, man.

01:06:02.534 --> 01:06:04.103
I know you are.

01:06:05.237 --> 01:06:06.738
But I can't ask you to do this

01:06:06.772 --> 01:06:08.107
unless I know
you really want it.

01:06:09.641 --> 01:06:12.211
The club, the life, all of it.

01:06:12.244 --> 01:06:13.612
All in.

01:06:13.645 --> 01:06:14.846
'Cause if you have any doubt,

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.282
I need you to walk away.

01:06:21.653 --> 01:06:23.455
I love you, Ezekiel.

01:06:27.559 --> 01:06:29.095
I love you too.

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:38.570
I'm all in.

01:06:45.244 --> 01:06:47.479
Start digging, Boy Scout.

01:06:57.256 --> 01:07:00.226
("Me and Baby Brother"
by War)

01:07:00.259 --> 01:07:06.365
*

01:07:06.398 --> 01:07:09.401
* Me and baby brother

01:07:09.435 --> 01:07:11.970
* Used to run together

01:07:12.003 --> 01:07:14.906

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:18.009
* Me and baby brother

01:07:18.043 --> 01:07:20.812
* Used to run together

01:07:20.846 --> 01:07:23.215
* Yeah-ah-ah

01:07:23.249 --> 01:07:26.285
* Welcome one another

01:07:26.318 --> 01:07:28.687

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.623

01:07:31.657 --> 01:07:34.293
* Come back, baby brother
