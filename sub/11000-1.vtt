00:35.536 --> 00:37.671
[Boy]
They say the last thing
she cried out

00:37.705 --> 00:40.108
As they put the noose
around her neck,

00:41.742 --> 00:44.845
Was a curse
on all the children
of the land.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.348
Don't they usually
burn witches?

00:47.381 --> 00:49.783
She wasn't like
any other witch.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.453
She wouldn't drown.

00:52.486 --> 00:55.089
She wouldn't burn.

00:55.123 --> 00:59.427
It took nine hours
before she finally died.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.263
They took her down
and cut up her body

01:02.296 --> 01:06.234
And placed it
in nine unmarked graves.

01:08.402 --> 01:12.306
My granddad says
witches don't exist.

01:12.340 --> 01:15.376
Of course they do.
My dad was there.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.179
He saw
the hanging.

01:18.212 --> 01:22.450
Blood leaked
from her eyes.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.352
The children
didn't get sick

01:24.385 --> 01:27.388
When they played
around the tree.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.158
People are saying
that Aldric has got plague.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.194
His sister said
he was always playing
around the hanging tree.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.597
She searches out
other children

01:36.630 --> 01:39.700
Just like
her only son, Ulric.

01:39.733 --> 01:43.404
Did she really
murder him?
Yes.

01:43.437 --> 01:47.441
She took her son
while he was sleeping.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.210
At St. Jonas' farm.

01:51.245 --> 01:54.182
She slit
his throat open.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.685
Along with the pigs.

02:01.422 --> 02:05.626
They say you can still
hear him crying through
the trees.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.235
Trying to ward off
other children,

02:14.268 --> 02:17.137
She wants to play
with her son.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.509
There's only one way
to find out

02:21.542 --> 02:24.745
If what they say
about Isobel is true.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.515
We must put our sticks
in the fire,

02:27.548 --> 02:31.352
And whoever's
burns up the quickest,

02:31.385 --> 02:33.821
Must touch
the witching tree.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.156
[Woman]
I must say,
Mrs. Thorson,

04:16.189 --> 04:19.293
I was quite surprised
to hear that you wanted
to go ahead with it

04:19.327 --> 04:21.862
After everything
that's happened.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.964
It's what Tony
would've wanted.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.502
For me to have gone
through with it.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.741
Well, I think
it's a very brave
decision.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.777
Have you heard anymore
from the hospital?

04:36.810 --> 04:39.347
No.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.549
But he's going
to get better.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.619
Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.

04:47.555 --> 04:50.324
You know, I grew up
not far from here,

04:50.358 --> 04:53.927
And... well, to me,
St. Jonas' farm

04:53.961 --> 04:56.830
Always had something

04:56.864 --> 04:58.899
Of the heavens
about it.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.372
It's not so bad
for an 800-year
old house, is it?

05:04.405 --> 05:05.706
It's done quite well.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.644
Anyway,
I think you
and your family

05:10.678 --> 05:12.012
Are going to be
very happy here.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.014
[Birds chirping]

05:16.550 --> 05:19.553
I've left some tea bags
on the counter for you.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.555
And...

05:21.589 --> 05:23.591
Don't believe the things
you hear about Isobel.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.793
And there's milk
in the fridge.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.361
What?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.564
Milk.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.433
There's milk
in the fridge

05:32.466 --> 05:34.334
If you wanted
to make yourself
a cup of tea.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.640
Thank you.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.756
It's a healing stone.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.358
It's meant
to be stronger
than some doctors.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.631
I take it
Mom has told you
about the farm.

06:05.999 --> 06:09.470
Why did you decide
to live on a farm
when you were kids?

06:09.503 --> 06:12.440
It's all right for you.
You're in a fucking coma.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.778
Come on.
You know you want
to wake up and ground me.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.914
It's the "F" word.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.650
(Emma)
Jake.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.953
I knew you'd be here.
What are you doing?

06:25.986 --> 06:28.689
Trying to get Dad
to wake up and ground me.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.892
You're lucky
I got home before Mom.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.627
She finds that
you're bunking again

06:33.661 --> 06:36.797
And I'm covering up for you,
she'll kill us both.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.132
Dad's not waking up
anytime soon to stop her.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.636
I cannot be
bothered with today.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.105
Is it the same lads?
No.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.040
They don't bloody
bother me anymore.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.743
Don't swear.
"Bloody" isn't swearing.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.680
Yeah, it is.
And how come Mr. Henderson
is always saying it

06:52.713 --> 06:54.181
When shouting at me
for bunking?

06:54.214 --> 06:56.784
'Cause Mr. Henderson
is a dick.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.853
Look, go away outside.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.125
See you
on Thursday, Dad.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.834
Hi, Dad.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.670
Mom really is losing it
without you, you know?

07:19.607 --> 07:21.542
If you don't
wake up soon...

07:27.080 --> 07:29.983
I'll bring you some
new flowers from the farm
when we move in.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.521
[Door opens]

08:13.226 --> 08:15.095
So, what
do you think?

08:15.128 --> 08:17.030
I think,

08:17.064 --> 08:19.066
When did we become
Dickens children?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.769
Does it have heating?
Oh, don't start.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.638
You've got much
bigger bedrooms here
than in the last place.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.840
Why?
The animals aren't sleeping
with us, are they?

08:26.874 --> 08:29.677
We don't do the whole
nativity look, Mom.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.980
No, because the last holiday
we had, I couldn't even
get you in a barn.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.618
I've decided I want
to become a vegetarian.
Like Emma.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.256
You don't want
to be a vegetarian
like Emma.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.992
You just want
to wind me up.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.294
Now, finish
your lamb.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.063
I don't want to eat
Shawn the Sheep.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.932
It's not Shawn
the Sheep.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.735
It's off from a TV contract
from Wallace and Gromit.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.871
That sheep was killed
and put in the plate
for you to eat.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.774
How come Emma's allowed
to be a vegetarian
and I'm not?

09:33.807 --> 09:37.678
Because Emma decided to become
a vegetarian before we moved
to the farm,

09:37.711 --> 09:40.180
And before she was trying
to make a statement about it.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.951
Well, I'm not hungry then.
You've been unpacking all day.
How can you not be hungry?

09:45.252 --> 09:48.155
I'm not.
Fine, fine.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.023
Then feed the rest
to the pigs and get to bed.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.027
Not from the plate.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.796
It'll make
the washing up easier.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.371
He's getting worse
than you.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.239
Maybe if you don't make
the meat so rare and bloody,

10:06.273 --> 10:08.909
It might not
put him off so much.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.244
That's how
I've always cooked it.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.347
Yeah, and you've
already got one daughter
who's a vegetarian.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.850
Maybe take the hint.

10:16.884 --> 10:20.120
He's already started
naming the animals.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.222
I told him
not to do that.

10:22.255 --> 10:26.193
Yeah, well, I suggest
you make sure he doesn't name
any of them Shawn.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.242
"Happy moving in."

10:42.275 --> 10:44.244
* You're making me

10:44.277 --> 10:47.981
* Making me
A Monster *

10:48.015 --> 10:51.051
* Oh can't you see
Oh can't you see *

10:51.084 --> 10:52.920
[Voice whispers]

10:55.856 --> 10:58.892
* Oh you're making me
You're making me *

10:58.926 --> 11:02.095
* You're making me
A Monster *

11:04.331 --> 11:06.734
* [Vocalizing]

11:15.442 --> 11:18.178
I've given you a checklist
of things to do.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.413
Have you included
point 22, killing myself?

11:20.447 --> 11:23.216
You'll enjoy it
once you get used to it.
Why?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.385
Have you agreed
to start paying me
ten pounds an hour?

11:25.418 --> 11:28.055
You help here
on the farm,
you get free rent.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.157
So, as I'm technically
paying rent,

11:30.190 --> 11:32.425
Does that mean
I can have boys over?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.895
Possibly.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.297
Except for Mike.

11:37.330 --> 11:41.434
Look, I'm the landlord,
I set the terms.

11:41.468 --> 11:45.873
Speaking of pigs,
let's get you introduced.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.809
[Crows cawing]

12:14.267 --> 12:17.237
[Guy]
Where did he go?
Come back here.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.773
Why do you want to be
in a coma like your dad?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.095
Ow.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.079
What are you sketching?

13:32.112 --> 13:33.947
Nothing.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.019
The pigs keep on
making funny noises.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.257
They're just getting used
to their new home.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.159
Like we are.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.868
[Cell phone vibrating]

14:34.074 --> 14:35.909
Seriously,
if your mom...
My mom what?

14:35.943 --> 14:39.212
Look, she's got a farm now,
and she's got a shotgun.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.614
So... you're my naughty.

14:41.648 --> 14:42.916
Naughty rabbit.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.054
I love it when you do
the Emma-fucked-over thing.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.222
[Bed creaks]

15:03.570 --> 15:05.138
Jake?

15:08.341 --> 15:09.342
[Mom]
Emma?

15:12.612 --> 15:13.981
What is it?

15:19.987 --> 15:21.955
Thought I heard voices.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.257
Maybe it was Jake.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.960
No, I've just checked him.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.598
You have been drinking.
Maybe it's the voices
in your head.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.442
[Panting]

15:44.577 --> 15:46.146
There was something
in there.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.355
Yeah.
You.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.224
Why do you always have
to have such a problem
with him?

15:57.257 --> 16:00.693
It's because Dad's
not here to approve?

16:00.727 --> 16:03.263
I just found him
in your bedroom
with his trousers down.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.366
You would at least let him
put them back on before you
threw him out the front door.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.769
He was expelled
from school for having weed.
Oh, that was ages ago.
He was 15.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.172
That makes it worse.
He was set up.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.274
By the teacher's
little league wee club?

16:14.307 --> 16:17.044
Yeah, I thought they always
seemed a bit high that
Paris evening.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.178
Don't try
to be funny, Mom.
It's embarrassing.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.147
He's an idiot.
He's a cute idiot.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.382
Do you want
to end up like me?
Pregnant at 16?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.384
I was such a big
fucking mistake, was I?

16:24.417 --> 16:26.586
He's not having
his trousers down again
with you in my house.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.522
Fine. I'll invite him out
for random nudity when I'm out.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.691
God, sometimes I wish
I was religious like Dad,

16:31.724 --> 16:33.693
Because then I could go
into confession and tell them
I'm guilty

16:33.726 --> 16:35.295
Of thinking my mom
is a bitch.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.073
[Door slams]

17:11.364 --> 17:12.464
[Male voice]
Emma.

17:17.503 --> 17:19.239
Dad?

17:58.678 --> 18:00.547
[Kid's voice
whispering]
Isobel.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.132
[Gasps]

18:20.233 --> 18:21.168
[Exhales]

18:22.702 --> 18:24.337
Jake.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.286
Hey, guys.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.254
How are you?

18:41.288 --> 18:44.824
Dad still
hasn't woken up.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.227
Mom and Emma
have been fighting again.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.330
Can't even taste
the bacon.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.802
Have you not intended
to muck the pigs out
and that?

18:55.835 --> 18:58.705
Very funny.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.708
Caught Jake
sleepwalking again
last night.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.776
He hasn't done that
since Dad went
into the coma.

19:05.412 --> 19:08.215
He's just adjusting
to the new house.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.817
It'll stop
once we're settled in.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.821
I've got to get him off.
Make sure you get that
assignment done today.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.290
Is that before or after
I feed the pigs?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.559
Whichever you want
to conform to the most.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.828
Pigs.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.630
[Pigs grunting]

19:28.601 --> 19:30.903
Oh, God.
You guys eat more
than Uncle Johnny.

19:30.937 --> 19:34.241
[Pigs grunting]

19:46.253 --> 19:49.822
The esophagus was
probably torn, which would
have made it cough up blood.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.625
Did the pigs come
from the same litter?

19:52.659 --> 19:55.228
No, they were bred
by friends of my husband.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.436
It's a nice farm,
St. Jonas.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.238
A bit scary.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.275
I had heard.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.746
No, I meant,
have I taken on
too much?

20:13.780 --> 20:16.283
Yeah, of course.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.451
My dad used
to be the vet here.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.654
I've just taken on
the family business.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.957
He did say
the family before said
the house had a few problems.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.828
With-With the roof.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.950
[Shouting]
Stop, stop.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.018
No!

20:55.322 --> 20:58.057
I spoke
to the doctor again.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.461
You said that
you'd reconsider
after two weeks.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.466
Jake said he saw
his hand move.
Oh.

21:06.499 --> 21:10.737
Jake would say anything,
the same as you would.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.505
Tony would hate this.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.441
And how do you know
what Tony would want?

21:14.474 --> 21:17.444
I'm his mother.
And he's my husband.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.012
And he spoke to me
a hell of a lot more
than he spoke to you.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.949
And how much
do you speak
to your children now?

21:22.982 --> 21:26.085
Living in your
little world,

21:26.118 --> 21:30.457
Trying to create
this fantasy home
for him to come back to.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.359
He might.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.328
He would rather die
than come back like that.

21:37.897 --> 21:42.435
Oh.
It would be worse for him
than being in a coma.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.372
And if that
did happen,

21:45.405 --> 21:47.707
You wouldn't have the option
to switch him off.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.479
You've got
to let go, Amber.

21:52.512 --> 21:56.115
Those children
have got to let go.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.951
And if you can't do it
for you and Tony,

21:58.985 --> 22:00.587
Then do it
for Emma and Jake.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.799
Two more weeks.

22:13.966 --> 22:17.604
That is what
you always say.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.744
This time I mean it.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.552
Hey, you moved
into that new farm.
So?

22:32.585 --> 22:36.689
Only just moved in
and already smells
of pig shit.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.125
How much
did you pay for it?
I don't know.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.828
Probably got a good rate
considering what
happened there.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.129
Nothing happened there.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.998
You're calling
me a liar?
No.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.801
You know, if you want us
to stop picking on you,

22:48.835 --> 22:51.771
All you need to do
is show us that you're
all right.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.940
How can I be all right?
Do something.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.609
Like what?
I don't know.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.945
Find out
why that woman
murdered her family.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.913
No woman murdered...
Yes, she did.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.682
She was just
like your mom.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.618
And they moved in.
Just like your family did.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.955
She gave him sleeping pills
before going to sleep
and burnt him alive.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.993
Afterwards, the mom
hanged herself
in the barn.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.563
Still no one
knows why.

23:16.596 --> 23:19.899
But your mom will do
exactly the same thing
to you and your sister

23:19.932 --> 23:21.067
If you don't find out
in time.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.869
How am I going
to find that out?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.171
Tyler's big brother
is in something
not really kosher.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.939
Right, Tyler?
Yeah.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.576
Embarrassing kid.
Hey.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.011
And he's got one
of these Ouija boards
like in The Exorcist.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.562
You've come
to help me?

23:49.596 --> 23:51.798
Ma, are you
all right?

23:51.831 --> 23:53.833
Why are you all
covered in mud?

23:53.866 --> 23:55.635
I fell over.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.550
Were you and Nan
talking about Dad
again today?

24:12.852 --> 24:14.621
No, she's just dropped by
to let me know

24:14.654 --> 24:16.689
That apparently
she's become
the first female pope.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.963
I saw more letters
have come through
from the hospital.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.900
Still no signs
of improvement then?

24:31.137 --> 24:32.972
I hope you don't...
Um, bloody vegan,

24:33.005 --> 24:34.907
What am I meant
to put in these rolls?

24:38.711 --> 24:42.715
If you kids think...
Mom, I support you in whatever
you want to do with Dad.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.951
Jake is not ready
to let him go.

24:46.853 --> 24:50.690
What did you tell Nan?
Two weeks.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.859
How did she take that?

24:52.892 --> 24:55.261
Well, let's just say
your dad wasn't lying
when he said that your Nan

24:55.294 --> 24:57.530
Could breathe fire
like a dragon.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.100
[Gasps]

25:03.002 --> 25:05.705
What?

25:05.738 --> 25:08.040
I just saw
something outside.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.893
Jake.

25:44.611 --> 25:47.714
Mom is really letting you
go out in that?

25:47.747 --> 25:51.017
Luckily, mom had to go
to London early today,
so she won't see it.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.754
You'd better head off.

25:54.787 --> 25:58.057
I will do.
I'm taking my bike,
so I can leave later.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.927
Yeah, well,
I'm heading out after college,
so I'll be back later.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.630
You can microwave
yourself something
if you get hungry.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.197
[Music from TV]

26:05.231 --> 26:07.900
You need to watch
your sleepwalking, okay?

26:07.934 --> 26:10.870
Sleepwalking?
Yeah, we found you
outside last night.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.139
Where?
Barn.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.842
You weird child.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.582
Bet SpongeBoob
doesn't have to deal
with this shit.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.655
And you're sure
they won't be back
until later?

26:28.688 --> 26:31.858
No.
My mom's
in London.

26:31.891 --> 26:34.260
And my sister
is visiting my dad.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.995
The one
in the coma?

26:39.231 --> 26:40.967
'Course he means
the one in the coma.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.401
How many dads
do you think he's got?

26:42.434 --> 26:43.202
His mom's
not like yours.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.774
Right beneath
where she hung herself.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.142
[Laughter]

26:50.176 --> 26:53.145
Come on.
Put your hand
on the thing.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.381
He's got
to plant it.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.119
Told you
not to get potsie.

27:02.689 --> 27:03.923
Come on.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.191
Put your hand
on it.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.235
You, too.
What?
Why me?

27:16.268 --> 27:18.337
I thought
it was just him.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.907
You told me
it worked better
with more than one person.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.241
I ain't doing it
on my own.

27:22.274 --> 27:25.344
Yeah, but I ain't really
used it in a place

27:25.377 --> 27:27.013
Where someone
died before.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.015
That's why
we're here, dickhead.
Now, do it.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.859
I ain't putting
me hand on that thing.

27:39.892 --> 27:43.029
I'm a girl.
I'm not as stupid
as you three.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.131
That's debatable.

27:47.099 --> 27:50.369
Come on, paranormal.
Speak to them.

27:50.402 --> 27:53.706
Like what?
I don't know.
The usual crap.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.241
Is anybody there?

[Animal grunting]

28:01.347 --> 28:02.915
Jordan, look.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.355
You sure
did that, Tyler.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.891
No, I didn't.
I swear on Eminem's life.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.996
Go on. Jake.
It's your turn now.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.200

that killed her children?

Are you one
of her kids?

Did you die
near here?

28:42.021 --> 28:45.724
Oh, what a fucking waste.
Bet you didn't even get
a decent death?

28:47.894 --> 28:50.062
You're not supposed
to piss off the board.

not to get potsie.

it mean?

Is that how old
you were when you died?

Did you die
near here?

we should stop this.
Shh.

stop this.

No, it's just

Gives us a sign
that you're here.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.410
You're not supposed
to ask for signs.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.012
My brother said
it's dangerous.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.948
It's only
a stupid board.
Shh.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.449

Are all the animals
in here, Jake?

30:23.622 --> 30:26.926
I don't know.
I think so.

Ask the board, Jake.
Do it.

your face, Jake.

What's going on?
He steals so his mom
doesn't have to work tonight.

You know,
I bet your dad's
not even in a coma.

so he doesn't have
to see you.

my dad is?

out of my family.

35:41.707 --> 35:45.143
My dad's hand,
it just moved.

35:47.313 --> 35:50.249
Whoever it is,
this isn't funny.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.254
Dad?

35:56.755 --> 35:57.756
Give me a sign.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.359
Jake?

36:00.392 --> 36:02.861
[Voice whispering]
Iza.

36:04.896 --> 36:07.366
Please don't hurt me.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.235
Jake.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.471
Get the nurse.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.907
What is it, Dad?

36:15.941 --> 36:17.843
What are you trying
to say?

36:17.876 --> 36:20.279
Someone, please.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.717
Jake.

36:25.751 --> 36:26.885
Yes, Jake.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.621
I know
it's you.
Stop.

36:29.655 --> 36:30.889
House.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.260
Don't do this.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.195
House.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.701
This is not funny.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.307
Who is there?
Help me.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.575
Stop it.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.912
I know it's you.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.251
(Jake)
Help.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.790
(Jake)
Help.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.326
I'm letting him out.

37:07.359 --> 37:10.862
Bloody hell.
He screams louder
than she does.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.599
[Jake screaming]

37:13.632 --> 37:15.033

[Screaming]

37:17.336 --> 37:18.670
[Pounding]

37:21.307 --> 37:23.041
Jake, where
have they put you?

37:23.074 --> 37:25.243
(Jake)
Let me out of here.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.715
[Crash]

37:29.748 --> 37:30.816
What the fuck?

37:30.849 --> 37:32.284
[Muffled screams]

37:35.020 --> 37:37.923
[Muffled screams]

37:40.892 --> 37:42.060
What's going on
in there, Tyler?

37:42.093 --> 37:44.530
[Pounding]

37:44.563 --> 37:46.365
(Shelley)
Let me out.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.232
(Jake)
Help me.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.936
(Jake)
What's going on?

37:50.969 --> 37:52.971
[Pounding]
Stop it.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.774
Let me out of here.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.709
Jake?
Let me out.

37:57.743 --> 37:58.677
[Muffled screams]

38:01.447 --> 38:03.949
[Muffled screams]

38:03.982 --> 38:06.051
[Screaming stops]

38:06.084 --> 38:08.286
[Hinges squeak]

38:11.823 --> 38:14.760
(Jake)
Please stop it.

[Screaming]

38:16.528 --> 38:18.597
[Pounding]

38:18.630 --> 38:19.931
Stop.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.701
Let me out.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.602
Let me out of here.

38:26.572 --> 38:29.675
Please.
Somebody.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.042
Help.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.678
[Pounding]

38:32.711 --> 38:33.712
This isn't funny.

38:35.747 --> 38:38.684
Let me out.
I don't like it.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.819
Help!

38:40.852 --> 38:43.522
[Screaming]

38:49.995 --> 38:51.997
[Shelley screaming]

38:56.635 --> 38:58.470

39:05.677 --> 39:06.945
[Voice whispering]
Isobel.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.083
[Child crying]

39:23.829 --> 39:26.398
They can tend to speak
quite a bit at this stage,

39:26.432 --> 39:29.100
But it's just a reaction
from the nerves.

39:30.769 --> 39:33.605
Just try not to get
your hopes up too much.

39:33.639 --> 39:34.640
Okay?

39:39.845 --> 39:41.980
I want to get back
to the house.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.516
Got this
really bad feeling
something's wrong.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.550
(Jake)
Help.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.718
(Mike)
Jake.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.620
[Screaming]

40:21.653 --> 40:23.889
Jake.
Jake, stop,
it's me.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.992
Look.
Jake.
Jake, stop.

40:27.025 --> 40:30.061
Look, look, look.
Look, it's me.
It's Mike.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.898
It's Mike.
You're all right.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.734
You're all right.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.102
You're okay.

40:37.135 --> 40:40.772
They were here.
They were here.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.544
They're gone now.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.079
They're gone.

40:52.984 --> 40:56.688
[Clock ticking]

40:56.722 --> 41:00.759
I can see from the runes
your sister walks
a happy path.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.064
Is she with someone?

41:09.601 --> 41:11.469
Tell me,
do you grieve
any children?

41:12.804 --> 41:15.907
No.

41:15.941 --> 41:19.845
A child your sister
doesn't know has stepped up
from off the path.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.249
I don't know
of any child.

41:26.051 --> 41:28.186
Where are you
from, child?

41:28.219 --> 41:31.657
This is not your path.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.892
[Whispering]
Nine.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.897
Stop this.
I want to hear
from my sister.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.900
No.
She's gone.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.769
Please stop this.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.136
[Whispering]
Play.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.672
Shoo.

41:46.705 --> 41:47.939
Crazy woman.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.140
[Coughing]

41:49.174 --> 41:50.542
Get my sister.

41:50.576 --> 41:52.310
Crazy.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.145
What's happening?

41:54.179 --> 41:55.881
[Coughing]

41:58.049 --> 41:59.785
They're back.
Who?

41:59.818 --> 42:02.153
The children.

42:02.187 --> 42:05.090
Where?
To a place named
after a saint.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.164
Come on, calm down.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.335
Made you a tea.

42:17.368 --> 42:20.739
Five sugars
and extra milk,
just how you like it.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.678
Did they take anything?

42:26.712 --> 42:29.681
I don't think so.

42:29.715 --> 42:31.950
Mike found a rucksack
of stuff upstairs.

42:37.155 --> 42:39.257
Dad's necklace.
They put it on me.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.126
Shh, it's okay.

42:41.159 --> 42:44.262
Probably just
fell off somewhere.

42:44.295 --> 42:45.964
We'll find it.

42:51.269 --> 42:54.139
What is it?
There's someone
out there.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.807
I think
they're still here.

43:26.204 --> 43:28.306
We've called the police.

43:28.339 --> 43:30.008
You better fuck off now.

43:32.243 --> 43:34.680
[Breathing]

43:53.231 --> 43:55.400
Thankfully Jake gave us
the names of the boys,
Mrs. Dawson.

43:55.433 --> 43:56.902
We can head over
to their houses
immediately.

43:56.935 --> 44:00.706
What sort of kids are they?
Imagine what they could
have done to him.

44:00.739 --> 44:03.809
I know the names
of two of them.
Troubled homes.

44:03.842 --> 44:06.745
But I must say
this is a little bit
extreme for them.

44:06.778 --> 44:09.047
But I promise you
we take things
very seriously.

44:09.080 --> 44:11.249
We can get the school
to monitor it as well.

44:11.282 --> 44:13.785
I can't believe
I didn't know
what was going on.

44:13.819 --> 44:16.888
Kids have a way of keeping
bullying in secret.
Specially boys.

44:16.922 --> 44:19.691
Unfortunately
when they do, things
can get out of hand.

44:19.725 --> 44:22.160
But at least
we can deal with it now,

44:22.193 --> 44:25.931
Although you really do need
to get your son to talk to you
if anything else happens.

44:25.964 --> 44:28.800
Don't worry, I will.

44:30.869 --> 44:32.470
You were meant
to be looking
after him.

44:32.503 --> 44:35.440
What do you want me to do?
Babysit him until he's 15?

44:35.473 --> 44:38.710
You'd better
not bully that boy.
Do you dare
blame this on me?

44:38.744 --> 44:41.346
Maybe if you weren't
so worried about making
this stupid farm for Dad

44:41.379 --> 44:43.949
Who's never going
to wake up.

[Birds chirping]

45:02.768 --> 45:05.203
Do you think that maybe
Jake can't talk to you
for a reason?

45:10.942 --> 45:13.511
We're already
losing our dad.

45:13.544 --> 45:15.080
We don't want to lose
our mom as well.

45:18.449 --> 45:19.985
Sorry.

45:21.319 --> 45:23.021
Didn't know
you felt like that.

45:23.054 --> 45:25.523
We know you're hurting.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.959
We don't want to put
anymore crap on you.

45:33.131 --> 45:36.334
Why did you have
to go and buy a house
where a mother killed her kids?

45:36.367 --> 45:38.236
What?

45:38.269 --> 45:40.305
Don't be ridiculous.
Who told you that?

45:41.940 --> 45:43.208
Jake.

45:45.243 --> 45:47.078
[Horses running on TV]

45:48.880 --> 45:50.048
[Knock on door]

45:54.385 --> 45:57.188
What are you watching?
Game of Thrones.

45:57.222 --> 45:59.891
Not going to help,
is it?
Hey.

45:59.925 --> 46:01.492
Look, I've just
paused it.

46:01.526 --> 46:03.895
You can get back
to watching people die
in a minute.

46:06.965 --> 46:09.200
I heard those bullies
were telling you stories.

46:11.469 --> 46:15.340
I just looked into it,
and a woman did kill
herself in the barn.

46:15.373 --> 46:17.542
But she didn't kill
any kids.

46:17.575 --> 46:19.577
Maybe she did.

46:19.610 --> 46:24.049
Maybe she strangled them
and buried them in the woods.

46:24.082 --> 46:26.251
Maybe that's why
she hanged herself.

46:26.284 --> 46:30.355
She was just a lonely woman
who was depressed and drank
too much.

46:30.388 --> 46:33.391
Why?

46:33.424 --> 46:35.493
People thought
she was mad.

46:35.526 --> 46:37.462
Her husband took
her kids away from her.

46:39.464 --> 46:42.934
That's not going
to happen to you
though, right?

46:42.968 --> 46:44.870
Of course not.
Why would you say that?

46:44.903 --> 46:48.173
Nan said...
You don't have to listen
to what your Nan has to say.

46:52.477 --> 46:53.478
I'm nearly
losing your dad.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.316
I'm not going
to lose you two
as well.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.520
You should have told me
what those kids were up to.

47:02.553 --> 47:07.358
I know you have enough
to worry about.

47:07.392 --> 47:10.361
I can help you
and your sister more
than I can help your dad.

47:12.898 --> 47:16.334
You're my priority,
not some stupid farm.

47:20.138 --> 47:21.306
Okay?

47:28.179 --> 47:32.083
Millie, it's fine.
The police and school
are already involved.

He's just
a bit shaken.

They've already
been round.

47:50.501 --> 47:52.203
There's nine of them.

48:15.293 --> 48:18.063

48:18.096 --> 48:21.332
Do you want
to be sleeping
in my bed now?

48:21.366 --> 48:23.101
People might think
it's weird.

you didn't leave
the back door open?

49:53.458 --> 49:55.393
I'm sure.

49:55.426 --> 49:58.029
Somebody did.
Maybe Jake.

49:58.063 --> 49:59.530
Whoever it was,
we need to be
more careful.

50:04.769 --> 50:08.339
Maybe I'll put a lock
on his bedroom door.
Really?

50:08.373 --> 50:12.310
Well, just
until he's settled down
and he stops sleepwalking.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.279
I'll go and lock up
the rest of the house.

50:24.522 --> 50:26.224
We've only been here
five minutes

50:26.257 --> 50:28.326
And the fridge
already looks
like a slaughterhouse.

50:30.461 --> 50:32.130
What's with all
the boxes?

50:32.163 --> 50:35.100
I ordered
extra security.

50:35.133 --> 50:37.635
I'll put it up later.

50:37.668 --> 50:41.106
Those kids won't come
round here again
with cameras up.

50:41.139 --> 50:42.673
I'll get Jake
to help me.

50:42.707 --> 50:44.642
Give him
something to do.

50:44.675 --> 50:47.178
Oh, great.
So, they'll end up
on Crimewatc instead.

50:47.212 --> 50:49.247
It's either that
or the shotgun.

50:51.516 --> 50:54.519
Yeah, I thought
you could maybe
drive me into town tonight.

50:54.552 --> 50:57.522
This new house has been
a complete nightmare.
It is seriously trash.

53:25.570 --> 53:27.505
There's nothing there, Emma.

53:27.538 --> 53:32.410
You were just drunk.
I saw something.

53:32.443 --> 53:35.413
We've both watched it back
and there's nothing there
apart from a glitch.

53:35.446 --> 53:38.283
And I don't want you
drinking like that again
on a college night, okay?

53:38.316 --> 53:40.851
Not all of us
are alcoholics
like you.

53:46.624 --> 53:50.495
The police said
the rats probably came
from a pet shop.

53:50.528 --> 53:54.565
What, a bunch of kids
broke into a pet shop
and stole some rats?

53:54.599 --> 53:56.534
I'm worried, Mike.

53:56.567 --> 53:58.869
I've got the same feeling
I had before my dad
had the accident.

53:58.903 --> 54:02.773
Look, Emma, it's just kids
messing about, that's all.

54:02.807 --> 54:06.777
With dead rats?
Yeah, well,
they're fucked up kids.

54:06.811 --> 54:09.280

they didn't break
into a zoo.

59:19.924 --> 59:21.225
What if we dig up
their bodies?

59:23.127 --> 59:26.130
There's only one way
to find out.

59:29.099 --> 59:31.101
Really?
You're not going
to make me do it.

59:39.810 --> 59:42.780
I better not be the one
who gets the curse for
digging them up.

59:49.887 --> 59:51.989
[Digging]

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.313
There's nothing
down here.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.755
How did the book say
she did it?

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:00.791
She slit
their throats.

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:04.695
Like her son.

01:01:04.729 --> 01:01:07.064
And like her pigs
on the farm.

01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:11.802
We should take it
to the police.

01:01:11.836 --> 01:01:13.704
And how do we explain
we found it?

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:18.075
The knife is what,
over a thousand years old?

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:20.277
What are they going to do?
Put it in the British Museum?

01:01:57.247 --> 01:02:00.184
[Mom]
I thought you wanted
to be a vegetarian.

01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:06.156
I don't feel well.

01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:14.131
It's probably
just the stress
of what those kids did.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.434
You'll be all right
in a couple of days.

01:02:31.816 --> 01:02:33.884
[Deep breathing]

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:40.858
[Gasps]

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.028
[Gasps]

01:03:05.983 --> 01:03:08.118
[Snoring]

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:14.892
[Mom]
Emma.

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:17.127
Oh, Jake.
Jake.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.799
Get my mobile.
Now.

01:03:25.602 --> 01:03:26.570
Jake.

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:42.152
Emma?
Well, now.

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:45.923
I haven't seen you
come to church
for quite a while.

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:47.491
Haven't felt
like coming much.

01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:50.827
Not since Dad.

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:58.202
You know I'm here
if you ever need to talk.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.572
I'm scared, Father.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.244
I think Jake's
becoming ill.

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:09.846
I'm going
to lose him, too.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:13.083
He's not had an accident
like your dad?

01:04:13.117 --> 01:04:14.851
No.

01:04:17.154 --> 01:04:19.223
Do you believe
in demons, Father?

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:26.630
Well, technically,
that's part of my job
description.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:31.101
We moved
into this new farm,

01:04:31.135 --> 01:04:33.203
And there's
this tree nearby.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.473
We think
it's the Redwood tree.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.612
Have you heard
the story?

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:44.548
One about
Uric Redwood?

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.984
Yes.

01:04:47.017 --> 01:04:50.020
And his poor mother

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:53.190
They hanged
for witchcraft.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:55.292
So, it's not
just a story then.

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:00.931
What has any of that
have to do with your brother?

01:05:00.965 --> 01:05:03.600
Weird stuff
has been happening.

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:09.073
What kind of stuff?
Creepy stuff.

01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:14.311
We found a knife
buried in the woods
between nine stones.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:18.248
The plague children.

01:05:19.683 --> 01:05:23.053
What happened to them?

01:05:23.087 --> 01:05:25.222
Did they really
bleed to death?

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:28.425
No one knows.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:32.229
They... disappeared.

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:42.239
When I was a boy,

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.041
Working at the cathedral,

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:47.344
I found a book.

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:54.218
It recorded the deaths
of nine children.

01:05:57.421 --> 01:06:00.624
But next to each
of the names,

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:03.693
There was drawn
an upside down crucifix.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:10.200
You've heard of something
to do with this about
Redwood before, haven't you?

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.676
There was a young lad,

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.678
A long time ago now.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:22.746
A local.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:28.052
He probably played
in the same woods
as your brother.

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:29.519
Well,

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.457
He became sick.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:36.226
You know,
like in the stories.

01:06:39.063 --> 01:06:40.464
What happened to him?

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:05.355
I was sent
by Father Flanagan.

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:17.601
I've never seen Eva
have such a strong
vision before.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.037
There's something wrong.

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:27.444
His name
was Nathan Harrison.

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:35.752
The priest
couldn't help him.

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:38.655
Nor the doctors.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:41.391
So, they took him
to the last place
that they knew.

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:43.727
Where?

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.429
Witchcraft.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.499
I was very young
at the time,

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:52.202
And my sister
was a bit older.

01:07:52.236 --> 01:07:54.371
She stayed
with my mother
during the exorcism.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:59.576
Your mom saved him.

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:01.878
She did.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.614
[Speaking in Latin]

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:18.162
But she didn't save
herself.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.773
Eve was the only one
who saw what happened.

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:36.712
And it's the last thing
that she saw.

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:53.430
Your little brother,

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.799
He didn't say goodbye
to the spirits, did he?

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:57.901
No.

01:08:57.934 --> 01:08:59.903
They came to him.

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:02.138
Because he is a child,
like they are.

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:06.210
They are not
afraid of him.

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:07.711
Tell me,
did he speak
to Isobel?

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:10.247
I don't think so.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:13.350
He said it was
just the children.

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:17.421
Your father,
he's in a coma,
isn't he?

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:20.390
How did you...
I can feel him.

01:09:20.424 --> 01:09:22.192
[Thundering]

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:26.229
He's still in this world,
but not quite in the next.

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:28.832
He has already
opened the gates.

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:31.501
Now he merely waits
for them to close.

01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:34.537
Don't say that.
He's coming back.

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:38.742
Being blind to this world
and seeing in the next is
a terrible burden.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:41.545
A burden
not even bestowed
upon the worst of demons.

01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:55.925
[Whispering voices]

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:17.914
[Thundering]

01:10:34.298 --> 01:10:36.600
Mom, please,
give her a chance.

01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:39.836
I'm not letting
some nutty spiritualist
into this house.

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:43.707
Don't you think
there's been enough damage
caused to your brother?

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.376
What's wrong with you
going round to a place
like that?

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:48.545
Dad would believe us.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.246
Just leave it
alone, Emma.

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:56.586
You're giving me
a headache.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.289
I'm just about
to get things back
to normal on this farm.

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:03.893
Go and check
on your brother.

01:11:07.531 --> 01:11:08.665
[Jake retching]

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:14.904

01:11:19.676 --> 01:11:21.445
Oh, my God, Jake.

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.316
Mom!

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:28.918
This is what happened
to the other children,
isn't it?

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:31.821
Doctors can't help me,

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:32.989
And they can't help Dad.

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.791
No, it's not true.

01:11:34.824 --> 01:11:36.793
I just don't want
to end up like the pigs.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.962
I'll do what I can
to make you better,
I promise.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.035
[Groaning]

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:56.813
[Cell phone vibrating]

01:11:58.682 --> 01:12:00.984
Mom?

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.919
[Mom]
They're holding him in
for tests.

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:05.054
He's going
to be fine now.

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:06.823
[Sniffles]

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.092
I need you to watch
the farm, okay?

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:11.728
Okay.

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.631
If anything happens
or any alarms go off,

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:17.867
I need you to call
the police immediately.

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:19.669
Do you hear me?

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:21.438
Yes.

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:27.511
[Sniffles]

01:12:27.544 --> 01:12:29.846
[Crying]

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:50.093
[Thundering]

01:14:00.537 --> 01:14:02.639
Thanks
for coming over.

01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:06.175
That's what good
boyfriends are for.

01:14:09.546 --> 01:14:11.147
There must be something
we can do.

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:21.224
What?
Where did you throw
that Ouija board?

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:23.159
Out back
in the recycling bin.

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:25.695
It isn't collected
until tomorrow.

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:30.700
Jake didn't say goodbye
at the end of the séance.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.172
What if we can?

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:37.941
[Thundering]

01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:42.245
[Thundering]

01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:46.082
Is there anyone
in this barn but us?

01:14:57.894 --> 01:14:59.963
Are any of the nine
children here?

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.236
Give us
some sort of sign
to know where you are.

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:13.076
[Exhales]

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:17.747
She said they spoke to Jake
'cause he was a kid.

01:15:28.925 --> 01:15:30.093
What is it?

01:15:33.697 --> 01:15:36.099
The knife.

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:37.300
It's moved.

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.009
It's pointing
towards the woods.

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.988
Let's put it
on the board.

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:08.898
Can you hear me
from the woods?

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:09.933
[Sharp scream]

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:20.844
Was this knife
used to kill you?

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.117
Can you spell
your name?

01:16:30.887 --> 01:16:32.221
Can you do it for me?

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:43.099
"U."

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:44.734
For Uric.

01:16:49.773 --> 01:16:50.907
Mike.

01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:56.612
Don't turn around.

01:16:58.748 --> 01:16:59.783
[Whispering]
What is it?

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:02.952
There's something
beneath the bales
of hay.

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.998
There's nothing there.

01:17:18.234 --> 01:17:20.069
[Whispering]
They search out
to the end,

01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:21.671
Covered in red.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:25.675
Let's get back
to the house.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.755
(Emma)
Mike!

01:17:45.829 --> 01:17:47.163
(Mike)
Emma.

01:17:57.974 --> 01:17:59.743
I don't think they want
to say goodbye.

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:21.097
What's all this?

01:18:22.398 --> 01:18:25.034
It happened
last night.

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:27.403
So much
for your cameras.

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:33.109
Every single camera
went down at the same time.

01:18:34.778 --> 01:18:37.847
It must have short
circuited the electricity.

01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:40.416
Did you call the police?
What good have
they done so far?

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:43.920
Mom, this is not
a bunch of kids
from Jake's school.

01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:46.422
Did you do this?

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.492
To try and get me to believe
the dead children crap?
No.

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:52.161
As if I do that
with Jake laying
in the hospital?

01:18:54.798 --> 01:18:57.200
Get this place
cleaned up.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:19:00.804
He's coming home tonight.
It's the last thing he's
going to want to see.

01:19:00.837 --> 01:19:02.939
Get yourself off
to college.

01:19:26.996 --> 01:19:31.067
Mom's at work.
She doesn't know
I've invited you here.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.937
She still
doesn't believe you
after what happened last night?

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:37.306
I don't think she knows
what to believe any more.
Neither do I.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:41.978
I can feel them.
The children.

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:49.085
Please, Tony,
help me.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:54.190
I don't know what I'd do
if I lost him as well
as you.

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:01.865
What?

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:04.033
Speak to me.
What is it I need to do?

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:07.971
Eva.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.076
Eva?

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:21.284
You can feel there's
been much pain,
screaming.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.987
I can hear them
singing, like a choir.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.555
No angel dare
tread here.

01:20:26.589 --> 01:20:28.557
My brother's
become worse.

01:20:28.591 --> 01:20:31.460
I can feel
they're scared
for him like you are.

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:35.298
They know what is coming,
but their cries are too weak
to make out.

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:39.168
Do you have the knife?

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:51.915
[Clank]

01:20:55.151 --> 01:20:57.086
How many
of you are there?

01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:00.323
[Clanking]

01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:09.498
Nine.
No, wait.
There's another.

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:11.200
[Clank]

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:15.571
The depth... has sung.

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.340
[Exhales]

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:21.877
There's a terrible secret
held by this knife.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.449
The cut is deep.

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:35.124
Not as deep as the ones
of the children who cry.

01:21:45.969 --> 01:21:50.039
Am I going to end up
in hospital like Dad?

01:21:50.073 --> 01:21:53.509
No, of course not.

01:21:53.542 --> 01:21:56.679
It's just the doctors
can't find anything wrong
with you.

01:21:59.315 --> 01:22:02.151
The doctors say
you need two weeks
off school to rest.

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:05.288
Not all bad, eh?

01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:13.997
You have to listen to me, mom.
Jake needs help the doctors
can't give him.

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:16.232
I'm not listening
to this shit.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:19.468
They couldn't find
anything wrong with him.
He was throwing up blood.

01:22:19.502 --> 01:22:23.106
He's fine now,
and they will find out
what is wrong with him.

01:22:23.139 --> 01:22:25.141
As soon as the test
results come in.

01:22:25.174 --> 01:22:26.542
The other children
in the story,

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:28.978
They started
throwing up blood
just like Jake.

01:22:29.012 --> 01:22:31.114
Please, give Eva
one chance.

01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:37.720
Eva?

01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:42.691
I can't believe
I'm letting that boy
into this house.

01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:48.031
[Sighs]

01:22:48.064 --> 01:22:51.000
He'll be asking
for his weed next.

01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:58.007
Do you believe
in all that stuff?

01:23:00.343 --> 01:23:01.344
Mm?

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:08.517
Let's just
leave them to it.

01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:13.256
Do you want to play
a video game or something?

01:23:13.289 --> 01:23:15.458
I don't really feel
like playing.

01:23:29.172 --> 01:23:32.308
Once Eva opens
the gateway between us,
we cannot break the circle.

01:23:34.443 --> 01:23:36.145
We will be the energy
holding the gates together.

01:23:38.781 --> 01:23:40.783
If we do not close
the circle properly,

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:44.220
Dead matter
can escape
and harm us.

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:49.425
What about the gate
with the old neighbor's
Labrador?

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:53.129
You've great pain,
Mrs. Thorson.

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:56.565
But it doesn't come close
to the pain between worlds.

01:23:58.201 --> 01:24:00.436
You know nothing
of my pain.

01:24:00.469 --> 01:24:02.538
I may
not feel your pain,

01:24:02.571 --> 01:24:05.774
But I've held the pain
of many a tortured soul,

01:24:05.808 --> 01:24:09.245
Just like I hold
your hand now.

01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:17.286
Do you think
they'll be down soon?

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.061
Let us begin.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:32.668
I can feel
a great darkness
in this house.

01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:37.773
Light of my mere
living body may not
burn so bright.

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:39.542
But I ask you.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:43.446
Let me walk with you
in the darkness.

01:24:43.479 --> 01:24:46.249
Come towards
my living light

01:24:46.282 --> 01:24:49.852
So we may see
and hear your echoes.

01:24:53.856 --> 01:24:57.393
Does anyone out there
in the darkness know
who this knife belongs to?

01:25:00.496 --> 01:25:03.166
I can feel them.

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:05.434
The children.

01:25:05.468 --> 01:25:08.771
They're afraid
to come out of the dark.

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:10.439
They're frightened.

01:25:12.175 --> 01:25:13.876
They're crying.

01:25:13.909 --> 01:25:16.779
Don't be afraid, children.
We're not going to harm you.

01:25:16.812 --> 01:25:19.148
Come take our hands.

01:25:21.684 --> 01:25:24.420
They need us
to let them know that
we are not going to harm them.

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:26.622
Please tell them.
They're so scared.

01:25:26.655 --> 01:25:29.292
Don't be afraid of us.

01:25:29.325 --> 01:25:32.161
We're here to help.
Come to us.

01:25:32.195 --> 01:25:34.163
[Kids crying]

01:25:34.197 --> 01:25:36.165
Speak to them.

01:25:39.702 --> 01:25:42.205
Please, don't be scared.

01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:45.741
Tell us what
you want with my brother.

01:25:45.774 --> 01:25:47.343
[Kids crying]

01:25:50.346 --> 01:25:52.147
Let them know
you mean no harm.

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:57.353
Of course
I wouldn't harm
any child.

01:25:57.386 --> 01:25:58.721
I'm a mother.

01:25:58.754 --> 01:26:01.957
That's right, children.
Come towards us.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.293
Come out
of the darkness.

01:26:04.327 --> 01:26:06.929
[Kids crying]

01:26:09.232 --> 01:26:10.699
They're here.

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:13.436
[Kids crying]

01:26:13.469 --> 01:26:16.472
[Eva whispering]
Can you feel them?

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:18.774
In the room
with us?

01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:42.498
[Child's voice]
Help us.
Please.

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:43.799
How old
are you, child?

01:26:43.832 --> 01:26:45.434
Nine.

01:26:47.303 --> 01:26:48.737
Are your friends
with you?

01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:50.906
Yes, we're scared.

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.908
Why are you scared?

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:57.946
She's here.
The woman that
brought the plague.

01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:04.487
[Woman's voice]
Die. We die
like roses.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.954
(Lily)
Don't break the circle.

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:16.265
(Eva)
What do you want
of the boy of this house?

01:27:16.299 --> 01:27:18.667
[Woman's voice]
Play. Play death.

01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:20.403
Why do you hold
the children?

01:27:20.436 --> 01:27:22.037
[Kid's voice]
Won't let us go.

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:25.441
Where were you
buried, children?

01:27:25.474 --> 01:27:27.976
[Kids's voice]
In the darkness.

01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:31.380
For what they did to her.

01:27:31.414 --> 01:27:34.550
The church.
The priests.

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:37.019
Knife not hers.

01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:41.056
Killed her son
for the farm.

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:44.493
Ulric murdered by men.

01:27:44.527 --> 01:27:46.795
The land.

01:27:46.829 --> 01:27:49.998
And now she comes.

01:27:50.032 --> 01:27:52.968
For the children
of the land.

01:27:54.503 --> 01:27:55.938
No!

01:27:55.971 --> 01:27:57.840
Eva.
Eva.

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:03.479
[Mom]
This is
all nonsense.

01:28:03.512 --> 01:28:05.781
I want these two women
out of my house.

01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:07.916
It's not nonsense, Mom.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:09.685
I need space,
I need air.
Lily, help me out.

01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:15.658
Get out.

01:28:15.691 --> 01:28:16.992
Get out!

01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:38.514
That woman
is coming nowhere
near my boy.

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:41.116
Someone needs
an exorcist in this house,
and it's not my son.

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:43.852
They're trying to help.

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:45.921
The doctors and nurses
haven't done much for dad.

01:28:45.954 --> 01:28:48.991
How dare you bring
your father into it?
With these freaks.

01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:51.527
They're not freaks.
This is bullshit.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.862
You saw the blood, mom.
You heard that voice.

01:28:53.896 --> 01:28:55.498
They do that kind
of thing.

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:57.533
And Jake,
is he tricking you?

01:29:29.498 --> 01:29:30.566
Where's Jake?

01:29:30.599 --> 01:29:32.568
What?

01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:33.602
It's Eva.

01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:42.978
She's...

01:29:46.749 --> 01:29:47.850
Where's the knife?

01:29:55.491 --> 01:29:57.793
[Mom]
Where is he?

01:29:57.826 --> 01:29:59.628
(Emma)
Oh, my God.

01:29:59.662 --> 01:30:01.864
She's going
to sacrifice him
like the other children.

01:30:23.686 --> 01:30:26.188
[All gasp]

01:30:28.824 --> 01:30:30.659
Jake!
Jake!

01:30:41.136 --> 01:30:43.972
The bleeding
won't take long.

01:30:44.006 --> 01:30:46.775
Not like
when they bled my son.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:49.111
[Cocks shotgun]

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:57.553
Get away
from my son,
you motherfucking witch.

01:30:57.586 --> 01:30:59.822
You don't have
to do this.

01:30:59.855 --> 01:31:01.624
We know
you were framed
for the murder.

01:31:09.164 --> 01:31:11.900
Do you want
to see in the dark
like your sister?

01:31:14.069 --> 01:31:15.671
Let me show you.

01:31:15.704 --> 01:31:17.105
[Screaming]

01:31:22.645 --> 01:31:24.146
[Gunshot]

01:31:24.179 --> 01:31:26.982
[Screaming]

01:31:35.057 --> 01:31:36.091
Ah!

01:33:53.428 --> 01:33:55.230
I brought you
a cup of tea.

01:33:56.865 --> 01:33:58.200
Thank you.

01:33:59.802 --> 01:34:01.770
Are you okay?

01:34:01.804 --> 01:34:05.073
I'm home now.

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:08.877
Everything will be
all right.

01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:12.781
I'm here
at St. Jonas' farm
in Kent,

01:34:12.815 --> 01:34:15.851
Home to the shocking
attempted murder of a mother
and her children

01:34:15.884 --> 01:34:18.687
And the death
of one teenage boy.

01:34:18.721 --> 01:34:21.389
Yesterday evening's inquest
found Eva Creeden guilty

01:34:21.423 --> 01:34:24.192
For the attempted murder
of the Thorson family

01:34:24.226 --> 01:34:26.094
And the murder
of Mike Buckingham.

01:34:26.128 --> 01:34:27.129
Twelve-year old Jake...

01:34:28.831 --> 01:34:30.198
Come on.

01:34:33.335 --> 01:34:35.037
It's time to go.

01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:50.685
(Lily)
Are you there, Eva?

01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:01.163
Your father
is with Eva now.

01:35:07.836 --> 01:35:09.371
You can talk to him.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.176
The coma
no longer holds him.

01:35:16.278 --> 01:35:19.848
Is he free now?
Yes.

01:35:19.882 --> 01:35:23.819
He wants you to know
that he's now awake.

01:35:25.954 --> 01:35:30.926
His body may not be able
to walk with yours
in this earth.

01:35:30.959 --> 01:35:32.294
But his memory can.

01:35:32.327 --> 01:35:34.529
Was it painful?

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:38.033
It was painful
leaving you.

01:35:40.135 --> 01:35:43.171
The passing was nothing
compared to that.

01:35:46.909 --> 01:35:49.177
If he's in heaven,

01:35:49.211 --> 01:35:53.315
Can he ask God
why the accident
had to happen?

01:35:53.348 --> 01:35:56.251
He is close with God.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.424
But not as close
as he is with your voice.

01:36:02.457 --> 01:36:06.895
No one who can still talk
from the other side

01:36:06.929 --> 01:36:08.130
Is too far gone.

01:36:12.367 --> 01:36:15.237
He's behind you, Amber.

01:36:17.005 --> 01:36:18.874
He doesn't need you
to believe me.

01:36:22.945 --> 01:36:26.248
He just says thank you.

01:36:28.951 --> 01:36:31.086
I can feel him.

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:33.956
You couldn't
leave him before.

01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:37.159
But you need to now.

01:36:39.962 --> 01:36:42.130
I can't.

01:36:42.164 --> 01:36:44.032
It's time
to let my son go.

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:47.936
And you need
to do this.

01:36:47.970 --> 01:36:50.172
(Lily)
He's still with you.

01:36:52.074 --> 01:36:55.210
But he doesn't
want to communicate
in this way anymore.

01:36:57.079 --> 01:37:01.049
He needs peace.

01:37:01.083 --> 01:37:05.153
This is not how
he wants to speak
with you in spirit.

01:37:05.187 --> 01:37:09.157
[Crying]
Oh, please Tony, no.

01:37:09.191 --> 01:37:11.626
I can't let you go.

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.962
It's time
to let him go, Mom.

01:37:13.996 --> 01:37:16.899
No.

01:37:16.932 --> 01:37:20.068
It's time.
Goodbye, Dad.

01:38:02.978 --> 01:38:05.247
Thank you for what
your sister did for us.

01:38:07.282 --> 01:38:09.684
Sorry for the way
people will remember her.

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:12.054
