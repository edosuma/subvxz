♪♪

00:42.543 --> 00:45.172
- Do you even care
about your future?

00:47.382 --> 00:49.175
I... I mean..

00:49.300 --> 00:51.260
35 days absent.

00:53.137 --> 00:55.265
There is no way we can pass you.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.725
No way.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.937
Hey, Cisco, we are here for

01:01.062 --> 01:03.607
the same thing every time.

01:04.940 --> 01:07.152
What are you doing
with your time?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.195
- Yeah, I..

01:09.320 --> 01:11.322
Babe, I'm on my way home now.

01:11.447 --> 01:12.508
- Did you hear what I just said?

01:12.532 --> 01:13.825
- Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

01:13.950 --> 01:15.844
- Alright, then look at me
when I'm talkin' to you

01:15.868 --> 01:18.203
and take your feet
down off my desk.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.250
Now, look, I know you don't care
about your diploma

01:22.375 --> 01:26.712
but you are close
to finishing your trade.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.633
- To be a mechanic. Bullshit.

01:32.218 --> 01:33.427
- Better than being a bum.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.390
- So what did you say
were my choices, again?

01:37.515 --> 01:41.310
- Automotive Technology.
Auto Repair.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.145
Auto manufacturing.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.232
- Fuck my life.

01:45.357 --> 01:46.440
- What?
- Hmm?

01:46.565 --> 01:47.650
- Huh?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.693
- I didn't say anything.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.822
- Nursing... culinary.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.490
Fucking kids in front of the car!

01:54.615 --> 01:56.533
- Finally passed
all your classes.

01:59.412 --> 02:01.497
That's some big deal.

02:01.622 --> 02:05.293
You got one more year
and you will be
a certified welder.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.377
Yay.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.847
- You have to do something
with your life, Cisco.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.060
What are you good at?

02:50.547 --> 02:53.048
- Hey! Yo! Go home!

02:53.173 --> 02:54.842
Go the fuck home!

02:54.967 --> 02:56.302
Get out of the street.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.262
Yo, get the fuck out of..

03:01.598 --> 03:03.518
- What are you doing?
Put your mask back on, bro.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.978
- I can't breathe
with this shit.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.331
- Get that motherfucker
out of there, bro.

03:07.355 --> 03:08.666
Get that motherfucker
out of there. Let's go!

03:08.690 --> 03:10.317
- Junior, what the fuck,
you can't drive.

03:10.442 --> 03:12.443
- Shut the fuck up, Patty.
Shut the fuck up.

03:12.568 --> 03:13.987
Get in the whip!
Get in the whip!

03:14.112 --> 03:16.238
- Come on, come on, come on.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.953
- You talking about gears?
It's a automatic, fool!

03:24.330 --> 03:25.330
- Shut the fuck up, bro!

03:25.373 --> 03:27.083
- This ain't no stick!
This ain't no stick!

03:27.208 --> 03:28.434
That's a red light.
That's a red light.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.378
- Stop touching
the steering wheel!

03:30.503 --> 03:33.213
- You're about to
fucking kill us, man!

03:47.478 --> 03:48.562
- Yo!

03:48.687 --> 03:50.147
This camera's dope.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.275
But we could record
our tricks on this.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.027
- Yo, come on, bro,
I'm trying to get to the crib.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.362
- Yo, Patty!

03:57.405 --> 03:58.572
Uh..

04:00.700 --> 04:03.410
Bro, that's the ugliest shit
I've ever seen.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.205
- Aw, hell no!

04:06.330 --> 04:08.582
- Yo, Junior, stop playin', man,

04:08.707 --> 04:10.208
- You a hater.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.585
- Yo, Cisco.

04:14.338 --> 04:17.341
Seventy-five.
- Seventy-five bucks?

04:17.466 --> 04:19.510
- Yo, take it or leave it, man.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.595
- This car's a 95, mint shape.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.430
You can get like
a stack for the body.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.315
- Engine's full...
- Who is this fucking kid?

04:25.348 --> 04:27.060
The car's old, it's busted.

04:27.185 --> 04:29.270
- You playing us, Abi-Kadabi?

04:31.313 --> 04:33.357
- Yo, Cisco, man,
who am I dealin' with?

04:33.482 --> 04:35.150
You or your crew?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.860
- Come on, Hassan.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.363
- Yo, take it or leave it.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.453
- That's fucked up, dude.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.540
- Better car...
better pay, boys.

04:54.587 --> 04:56.047
- On the real, Cisco

04:56.172 --> 04:58.883
we can't keep doin'
this shit for chump change.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.510
- It's better than nothin'.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.682
- But he smells funny.

05:05.807 --> 05:08.392
- I don't care
if he smells funny.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.603
Your job is to make
the customer happy.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.980
Baby, just don't
do it on my bed.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.525
- I mean, how are you
gonna be happy when..

05:15.650 --> 05:17.360
- I know, I know.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.987
I know, baby.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.448
- What's up, grandma?

06:09.453 --> 06:11.413
Oh!

06:12.498 --> 06:14.500
- You buy groceries?

06:14.625 --> 06:15.668
- You miss daddy?
- Hmm.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.587
- You miss daddy, hm?

06:20.507 --> 06:22.550
- Really?

06:22.675 --> 06:24.593
School lunches?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.775
- What's up, pops?
- Hey.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.152
What's up, boy?

06:41.277 --> 06:43.653
- Mama left you
some food on the stove.

06:47.617 --> 06:50.537
- And the welding masks,
they comin' in next week.

06:50.662 --> 06:52.580
Mm-hmm.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.430
- Oh, shit, not here, come on.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.517
Let's go this way. Alright.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.853
Oh, shit. Oh!

07:17.647 --> 07:19.523
- Hey, what's up, girl?

07:34.830 --> 07:37.111
- Three dollars,
you could take her home
and keep her, huh?

07:44.173 --> 07:47.092
- What's up, Slick?
- Whaddup?

07:52.890 --> 07:54.642
- You're gonna get fired.

07:54.767 --> 07:57.018
- Shit, I wish.
I hate this fucking job.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.313
If I had young ones,
I would have dang quit.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.570
You got pancakes and milk,
but no syrup?

08:06.695 --> 08:08.655
How you gonna eat
these dry-ass pancakes..

08:08.780 --> 08:09.907
With water?

08:12.368 --> 08:14.703
Slide $7.50, man.

08:26.382 --> 08:27.550
Want a bag?

08:34.807 --> 08:36.683
- Aye, Cisco the kid.

08:36.808 --> 08:37.893
What's up?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.647
- Harry Bush Tits, whaddup?

08:40.772 --> 08:42.315
- Shit, man.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.733
Just trying to get
this bus fare.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.240
Shit.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.452
Appreciate you, bro.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.577
Appreciate you.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.792
Brent! Yo, Brent!

09:01.917 --> 09:03.920
- Yo!
- Wassup, Brent.

09:04.045 --> 09:06.713
- Bush Tits, wassup?
- Oh, my man, wassup?

09:06.838 --> 09:07.632
- What the fuck is this?

09:07.757 --> 09:09.842
- I got more though.
- A dollar?

09:18.725 --> 09:19.810
- What's your name again?

09:33.698 --> 09:34.926
- Aye, Cisco, get away
from the window, man.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.827
Get the fuck away
from the window!

09:38.703 --> 09:40.748
Every summer, they want
to wile the fuck out, man.

09:40.873 --> 09:42.458
Punk-ass bikers.

09:59.892 --> 10:01.518
- Bro.

10:07.942 --> 10:09.818
- I don't want to be a janitor.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.738
- Man, you don't
got to do nothing.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.658
Don't let anybody control you.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.747
- What?

10:21.872 --> 10:23.665
- My mom used to say that shit.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.753
- That's 'cause
your mom was the shit.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.755
- You know what we gotta do?

10:29.880 --> 10:31.715
Get sponsored this summer.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.883
Start skating for money.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.343
- Dawg, that'd be sick.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.515
- I'm fucking tired
of Cleveland.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.892
I'm tired of these long winters

10:41.017 --> 10:42.727
of skating in basements.

10:42.852 --> 10:46.522
Man, I want to go somewhere
with no rules.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.732
We can chill, shred all day..

10:51.568 --> 10:53.403
Like Cali.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.613
- Skate by the beach..

10:57.575 --> 10:59.743
Design my own boards.

11:00.953 --> 11:03.122
Get two bad bitches pregnant.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.915
- What?

11:10.628 --> 11:13.632
- Hello. Hello!

11:13.757 --> 11:15.675
Dude, I can hear you laughin'.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.052
Give me my car back!

11:17.177 --> 11:18.845
I'm gonna come find you
fucking kids.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.855
- Can't catch me. Oh, okay.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.482
I see you! I see you!

11:29.607 --> 11:30.775
- Oh, my God.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.783
Be careful, this plate's hot.

11:40.910 --> 11:42.243
Come on, guys, stop.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.913
Sit down and eat.
Eat fast, alright.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.248
You're running late.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.917
And you.

11:48.042 --> 11:49.769
Just because you bought food
doesn't mean you can

11:49.793 --> 11:51.712
turn this into a hotel, alright?

11:53.963 --> 11:55.382
Thank you.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.427
Does your uncle
even know you're here?

11:58.552 --> 11:59.887
- You know, he's not my uncle.

12:00.012 --> 12:03.015
- Junior, come on,
you're gonna be late for school!

12:03.140 --> 12:05.183
- You know,
it's the last day, right?

12:06.935 --> 12:08.187
- So?

12:11.023 --> 12:14.943
- Stacey, here,
go wake up your brother.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.068
Go.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.493
Why the shitty attitude?

12:22.618 --> 12:24.870
- Place is a prison.
It's whack.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.788
- Yeah, well, too bad, alright.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.667
That's your school.
No, look at me.

12:29.792 --> 12:33.295
I'm counting on you
to take care of Junior, alright?

12:33.420 --> 12:34.880
He looks up to you.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.798
- Aye, Stacey!

12:38.508 --> 12:39.968
- Sit down and eat.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.470
Get dressed.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.848
I gotta go.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.350
Don't forget your snacks, okay.

12:46.475 --> 12:48.268
Alright, I'm running late.
Bye, guys.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.853
- Mom, I get no kiss?

12:49.978 --> 12:51.858
- You just make sure
your sister goes to school.

12:56.277 --> 12:58.862
- It's gonna be sunny today.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.448
Oh, shit!

14:07.305 --> 14:08.765
- Man, check this out.

14:11.602 --> 14:14.103
- Shit. Yo!

14:14.228 --> 14:16.083
I don't know if we're just
allowed to be walking
through here, bro.

14:16.107 --> 14:17.291
This has gotta be
private property.

14:17.315 --> 14:18.983
- Boobie, stop being a bitch.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.903
- Damn, bro, this shit is weird!

14:35.125 --> 14:36.877
- Alright, let's go, pussies.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.422
What you got, C?

14:39.547 --> 14:40.547
Uh!

14:43.592 --> 14:45.970
Whoo! Whoo!

14:46.095 --> 14:48.055
Fucking C, bro!

14:48.180 --> 14:51.017
Cisco's killin' 'em
on the fuckin' low.

15:07.825 --> 15:09.033
- This is suicide.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.995
- Hey, you wanna
get sponsored, right?

15:12.037 --> 15:13.997
- Cisco, bro! I'm rolling!

15:29.220 --> 15:31.307
Cisco, you're insane, bro!

15:31.432 --> 15:33.725
- Good!

15:33.850 --> 15:36.937
- Guys, I totally got that...
- Oh, shit! Cops! Cops!

15:37.062 --> 15:38.331
- Hey! Hey!
Hey, don't-don't move!

15:38.355 --> 15:39.355
Hey!

15:42.150 --> 15:43.610
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!

15:43.735 --> 15:45.612
Get off me!
Hey! What the fuck?

15:53.203 --> 15:55.122
- Yo, is that Brent?

15:55.247 --> 15:57.540
- Yeah.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.752
- Thought he dropped out.

15:59.877 --> 16:01.146
- What you want my
real name for?

16:01.170 --> 16:03.047
Just call me Patty Cake.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.063
We gotta make some money.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.988
- Well, you can help Hassan
with a better car.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.192
- Man, fuck Hassan.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.153
- You got a better idea?

16:27.278 --> 16:29.030
- There's gotta be
something, you know.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.657
- You can get
a job at McDonald's.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.011
- But you can't get no bitches
smelling like French fries.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.662
- Hmm, pull some fat bitches.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.163
- I know where the cafeteria is.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.665
I can walk me. Yo!

16:38.790 --> 16:40.583
Hey, what's up? Thank you.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.045
- Yo, his mom's gonna be
so pissed at you.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.130
- That ain't my fault.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.255
- What's going on, bro?

16:46.298 --> 16:47.632
Yo..
- It's good, bro.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.444
- They didn't confiscate
that shit?

16:50.468 --> 16:52.220
- Guys, they didn't
even frisk me.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.180
But they gave me
a big ass ticket though.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.307
My mom's gonna be pissed.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.225
- She's a fine ass.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.810
- Dawg, that's my mom.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.815
- Yo, a list of all
the skate comps this summer.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.373
- Yeah, I mean,
it's only a couple of 'em.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.940
- Of course, we're in Cleveland.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.275
- So what we're in Cleveland?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.152
We show up and get buck
like we always do.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.112
- Still gotta pay
those entry fees.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.406
Decks. Trucks.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.450
That shit ain't free.

17:20.165 --> 17:24.042
Hi, welcome to McDonald's.
Uh, can I take you order?

17:24.167 --> 17:27.255
- Oh, shit! No, no, no!
- No! Oh!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.066
- Boys!
- Yo, don't get none
in my apple sauce.

17:29.090 --> 17:32.010
- Boys! Settle down!
- We're good.

17:43.022 --> 17:45.148
- Bitches..

17:45.273 --> 17:46.942
Little bitches.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.947
You best get out of the way.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.665
Get out of the way!

18:02.790 --> 18:04.250
You want to die?

18:04.375 --> 18:05.877
Hey, get out of the way.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.215
You wanna play, motherfuckers.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.342
You wanna play?

18:19.307 --> 18:21.185
You trying to fuck with me?

18:23.228 --> 18:25.147
You tryin' to fuck with me.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.445
- Let's go, bro.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.198
Let's go!

18:43.207 --> 18:46.168
- Fuck, man! That is the last
time I'm doin' this shit, bro.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.253
We almost died back there.
- Yeah, but you didn't.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.047
- It doesn't matter, bro.
I could have.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.090
- Yo, shut the fuck up, man.
Chill the fuck out!

18:52.215 --> 18:54.008
Shut up, strip the car.
- Dumbass.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.178
- Yo, shut the fuck up,
get the back seat.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.103
- Yo, what's up, bro?

19:08.857 --> 19:12.235
- What is that?
- They look like my
abuelita's heart pills.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.362
- Heart pills
in the back of a trunk?

19:14.487 --> 19:15.488
Nah.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.202
Oh, this is molly.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.120
- Shit.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.415
- Yo, what the fuck, bro?

19:25.540 --> 19:26.333
- Yo, you crazy?

19:26.458 --> 19:28.418
- Yo, you guys done?

19:28.543 --> 19:30.295
- Put that shit back.
- Bro, think about it.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.965
We could sell these.
It's just like Ecstasy.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.633
- You're crazy, bro.
- We can't just leave it here.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.220
- Bro...
- Knock it off, man.

19:39.722 --> 19:41.973
- Yo, what the hell
is taking so long?

19:49.690 --> 19:51.483
- Okay, okay, okay.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.908
School called.
She ain't havin' it.

20:01.535 --> 20:03.953
Man, what you gonna do
with that shit?

20:04.078 --> 20:07.373
Patty Cake's right,
that's molly.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.498
It's not a joke.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.382
Hey, you heard?

22:37.482 --> 22:38.650
- Whoa!

22:38.775 --> 22:40.527
They're goin' crazy!

22:40.652 --> 22:42.862
They're screamin' his name.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.865
Oh, Cisco!

22:44.990 --> 22:47.533
Cisco! Cisco!

22:47.658 --> 22:49.452
Another one?

23:27.907 --> 23:29.367
- I..

23:31.493 --> 23:33.037
I've been meaning to call you.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.082
- Is that so?

23:36.123 --> 23:38.083
- Listen, Momma.

23:42.047 --> 23:45.300
I picked up the pills
from the car.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.677
Then there were these skaters.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.060
Gracias.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.525
What's with the kid?

24:03.735 --> 24:05.362
- His name's Elliot.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.030
He's picking up your slack.

24:08.155 --> 24:10.575
Now, look, I need you

24:10.700 --> 24:12.952
to find out who took your car

24:13.077 --> 24:16.455
and who the fuck has my pills.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.680
- Magic Wash.
- Hmm.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.223
Open it.

24:39.687 --> 24:42.440
It's pure MDMA.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.650
- So this what they stole?
- Basically.

24:44.775 --> 24:47.612
I had it ground down
and put in capsules, but..

24:47.737 --> 24:49.780
This is the last
shipment for a while.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.365
So..

24:52.325 --> 24:54.577
- Who the connect?

24:54.702 --> 24:57.497
- That's not any
of your concern.

24:57.622 --> 24:58.933
- So, I see you trust
this nigga Chino

24:58.957 --> 25:01.627
but you don't trust me.

25:01.752 --> 25:04.087
And he the one
who need to be handled.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.689
- Oh, yeah, like you dealt
with that crew

25:05.713 --> 25:07.465
on the west side
the other night?

25:07.590 --> 25:08.758
- Claimin' territory.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.468
- Listen, baby.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.347
You're just a dealer on a bike.

25:15.765 --> 25:18.602
When Chino finds his car
and traces down our pills..

25:20.562 --> 25:22.813
We collect.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.525
Until then,
try making less noise.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.653
- Fuck that shit.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.657
We need to send a message.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.160
- Okay.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.788
Look in the glove compartment.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.588
- I don't see nothin' in here.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.090
- This is how you send
a message.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.230
Now..

26:06.692 --> 26:09.818
I have some food for you
to take home for your mother.

26:09.943 --> 26:11.655
Tell her if she needs anything

26:11.780 --> 26:14.657
to come to my market stand
at 25th Street.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.827
This is for the wait.

26:41.893 --> 26:42.893
- Ting.

26:44.645 --> 26:48.023
Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting,
ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.

26:51.737 --> 26:53.863
Look who decided to come home.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.450
Cisco, welcome home.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.245
Hungry?

27:01.578 --> 27:03.415
No, no, no,
you're the fuckin' bank.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.260
You guys can extend
for as long as you want.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.002
I... I just need one more month.

27:07.127 --> 27:08.420
Right for as long..

27:08.545 --> 27:10.422
No..

27:10.547 --> 27:12.590
Okay, thank you very much,
miss, thank you.

27:12.715 --> 27:14.717
Fuck off! Fuck you!

27:14.842 --> 27:16.970
Fuck sake! Fuck me.

27:17.095 --> 27:18.680
Holy shit, Cisco, I forgot.

27:18.805 --> 27:19.906
Look what I've invested in,
look at this.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.515
Look what I invested in.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.977
This is one of those signs
that you twirl on the corner.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.813
- Ooh, that's like
those signs that they have

27:26.938 --> 27:29.065
down at the, uh..

27:34.278 --> 27:35.322
Tax places.

27:35.447 --> 27:37.698
- Tax places!
You're right, T.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.617
That's exactly right.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.787
So, Cisco.

27:41.912 --> 27:43.832
I was thinkin' maybe
you and Junior can, you know

27:43.955 --> 27:46.792
like, stand outside and you
know, they... they... they

27:46.917 --> 27:47.792
twirl the..

27:47.917 --> 27:49.335
- You paying?

27:50.837 --> 27:52.880
- Yeah.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.840
For the roof above your head.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.802
This place here
is keepin' us alive.

27:56.927 --> 27:58.887
- Keeping you alive.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.722
- I'm all you got.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.265
Don't forget that.

28:02.390 --> 28:04.159
And I promised your mama
I would take care of you.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.852
- Don't.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.853
Don't talk about my mom.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.402
- Yup.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.822
- Fuck!

28:17.947 --> 28:21.283
What the fuck
are you fuckin' doing?

28:21.408 --> 28:23.035
- What?
- Where'd you get that shit?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.662
- Out of my fuckin' purse!

28:24.787 --> 28:26.790
- You're fuckin' AA.
- Oh, I'm not in AA.

28:26.915 --> 28:29.035
- I can't see that shit.
Tryin' to stay fuckin' clean.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.710
- Cisco!
- Fuck you and stop fuckin'
spittin' on me.

28:31.835 --> 28:33.463
- Fuckin' junkie.
- Cisco, let's go, bro.

28:33.588 --> 28:36.215
- Junior, stop poundin' on the..

28:36.340 --> 28:38.175
You're gonna fuckin' break it.
- What's up, T?

28:38.300 --> 28:39.843
- They servin' 'em
nasty ass hotdogs?

28:39.968 --> 28:41.470
- Why did you do that?

28:41.595 --> 28:43.180
- Wipe this fuckin' down!

28:49.687 --> 28:51.105
- Bro, this shit look live.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.607
- Name and sponsor?

28:52.732 --> 28:54.608
- Uh, Boobie.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.945
But, umm, I'm not sponsored.

28:57.070 --> 28:58.863
- You have the registration fee?

28:58.988 --> 29:01.032
- Uh, yeah. How much?
- $150.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.242
- Each? Fuck, dude.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.870
We don't have $150 each.

29:05.995 --> 29:06.997
- Sorry, guys.

29:07.122 --> 29:08.288
- This is some bullshit.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.498
- Name and sponsor?

29:09.623 --> 29:10.792
- Hey, we got to skate.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.144
There's a whole bunch of
sponsors just watching.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.212
- I ain't skatin' outside
the comp like a bum.

29:14.337 --> 29:16.965
- If you guys want, there's
an after-party at Skatopia.

- Oh, I don't know

31:27.470 --> 31:30.557
I'm in, bro, man.

31:30.682 --> 31:35.143
I mean, what?
I'm with this shit, no question.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.496
- Come on, Boobie,
don't fuck us, man.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.188
You know, it's all or none.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.291
- What if these dudes come back
looking for this stuff, bro?

31:40.315 --> 31:43.027
- Then we stop.
- And the police?

31:43.152 --> 31:45.046
- Bro, they didn't even
frisk Junior
when he got caught.

31:45.070 --> 31:48.073
Remember? Come on, man,
it's our dream.

31:48.198 --> 31:51.035
- To skateboard, bro.
Not be drug dealers.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.995
- Bro, we're already
working cars.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.788
Everybody is doing something
to get ahead.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.165
- That's true, bro.

31:56.290 --> 31:58.000
- I don't know one person
who hasn't dealt

31:58.125 --> 32:00.002
something shady to get
what they want.

32:04.173 --> 32:06.133
- We can even help our families.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.432
- We sell enough until we get
into these competitions.

32:12.557 --> 32:15.017
And that's it, we stop?

32:15.142 --> 32:16.227
- That's it.

32:23.692 --> 32:24.943
- Come on, B.

32:28.907 --> 32:30.073
- No?

- What?

32:35.580 --> 32:36.913
- I've never fucking
tried Molly.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.708
If we traffic this shit,
let's take it.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.245
- Hey, what are y'all
dealing now?

33:16.370 --> 33:17.372
- We're not dealers, man.

33:17.497 --> 33:20.458
- Come on, bro.
You came to see me.

33:20.583 --> 33:24.128
At my crib, on my day off.

33:24.253 --> 33:26.088
Don't keep secrets.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.885
Now, that's good quality.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.137
- How do you know?

33:33.262 --> 33:36.057
- You see the powder
on the inside of the capsule?

33:36.182 --> 33:37.517
That means it's pure.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.102
And then this..

33:42.188 --> 33:43.188
- What?
- Hey, yo!

33:43.272 --> 33:46.358
- What?
- This is momma's shit.

33:46.483 --> 33:50.112
- Your mom's?
- No, man. This pill.

33:50.237 --> 33:53.032
Belongs to Momma.
Crazy ass lady.

33:53.157 --> 33:54.700
Been running game here
for years.

33:54.825 --> 33:56.202
She's not a joke.

33:57.287 --> 33:59.122
- Momma.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.128
- Tell us more about the pill.

34:08.297 --> 34:10.233
- Well, first of all,
you can't be dealing it
out of your

34:10.257 --> 34:11.632
dirty ass hands.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.444
You need to find something
to package it in.

34:13.467 --> 34:16.472
Something small, something you
can get rid of if you need to.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.188
- I mean, I know y'all's
breath stink, but goddamn.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.108
- Yo, this gonna take a minute.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.445
There's at least 7000 pills
in that bitch.

34:30.570 --> 34:32.322
- Then you gotta label the shit.

34:32.447 --> 34:36.117
People gotta know it's yours.
So you need a signature.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.368
You need a logo.

34:37.493 --> 34:40.245
- I just cannot draw.
That one's garbage.

34:40.370 --> 34:42.998
- We ain't gonna throw away
pills because they don't
look right.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.226
- Bro, this one is trash, bro.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.728
You're not drawing
the crescent right.

34:45.752 --> 34:47.420
- Now it's a party drug.

34:47.545 --> 34:50.297
Night clubs, raves, wherever
people are having a good time

34:50.422 --> 34:51.465
you be there.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.010
- Anybody seen my friend, Molly?

34:54.135 --> 34:56.637
She's small, she's white,
she's very cute.

at right now?

37:32.543 --> 37:35.253

- Yo!

37:35.378 --> 37:36.922

37:37.047 --> 37:39.175

- Twenty..
- One. One.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.890
- Twenty one.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.372

you're talking about, man.

38:17.630 --> 38:18.630
- Chino!

38:20.548 --> 38:22.385
- What's up, man? What's this?

38:24.595 --> 38:26.305
You found your car?

38:28.598 --> 38:31.685
- What the fuck you doing here?
- I was sent.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.478
To check in on you, bro.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.456
- Why would she send you
and your little bitch ass

38:35.480 --> 38:37.232
tricycle crew?

38:39.443 --> 38:41.445
Stay in line
before I fuck you up.

38:45.532 --> 38:47.075
Cuidado.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.383
- Alright, Chino.

39:04.552 --> 39:06.095
Let's go.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.927
- Here you go, enjoy!

39:50.890 --> 39:54.477
Hey, hey, hey,
I got dogs on the grill.

39:54.602 --> 39:55.727
How many you want?

40:10.242 --> 40:11.577
Check this out.

40:11.702 --> 40:15.538
Two years,
clean and sober, baby.

40:16.248 --> 40:17.583
Bam!

40:18.500 --> 40:22.170
It's actually, uh, 382 days,
14 hours, 16 minutes

40:22.295 --> 40:24.632
but who's counting, right?

40:24.757 --> 40:27.300
I feel, I feel good.
You know, I... I feel better.

40:27.425 --> 40:31.597
I do, I, uh...
it's a little win, I know

40:31.722 --> 40:35.683
but Lord knows I need it.
We, we need it.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.393
You know, I've been thinking..

40:38.728 --> 40:40.688
I think I know how to
improve our business.

40:42.692 --> 40:44.711
- I told you, I don't wanna,
I don't wanna work here.

40:44.735 --> 40:46.088
- No, no, I know, I know,
you've said it before.

40:46.112 --> 40:48.530
And I.. Hurts a little bit,
but I get it.

40:48.655 --> 40:51.658
It's a fucking diner,
and you're doing so good now

40:51.783 --> 40:52.903
with your skating and stuff.

40:54.995 --> 40:57.582
So I want in.
Team Uncle Steve.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.623
What?

41:00.708 --> 41:02.587
What, y... you, you're skating.

41:02.712 --> 41:05.547
I was thinking, that, that,
my business can sponsor you.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.175
You know, at those, uh,
those contests that you do.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.510
And when you win an award,
well, we can split the money.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.470
I mean, I need the money.
- There's no money.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.143
You think I'm blind?

41:19.770 --> 41:22.607
Come on,
we gotta help each other.

41:22.732 --> 41:26.527
Okay, I'm... I'm, I want it to
be like it was before. I do...

41:26.652 --> 41:27.652
- Stop.

41:30.197 --> 41:31.448
- What?

41:33.450 --> 41:35.410
You were too young, that's it.

41:35.535 --> 41:37.538
You were too young.
You're, you are, you were.

41:37.663 --> 41:40.207
You don't remember what I did
for you. All the shit that I...

41:40.332 --> 41:42.132
- You know, my mom
fucking OD'd 'cause of you.

41:43.710 --> 41:47.632
- Stop talking like that.
Can't talk that way to me.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.497
- Oh..

42:26.587 --> 42:27.588
It's okay.

42:29.632 --> 42:32.008
What you makin' all
that noise for, huh?

42:55.115 --> 42:56.617
It's okay.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.497
It's okay, baby.

43:04.207 --> 43:05.708
It's okay.

43:08.087 --> 43:09.838
It's okay.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.635
Baby, it's okay, baby.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.013
It's okay, baby.

43:33.570 --> 43:34.613
- Hey, Cisco.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.827
Oh, shit, are you okay?

43:39.952 --> 43:41.745
Come inside, let me
clean that up for you.

43:41.870 --> 43:45.332
- Ow! Ow, Stace.

43:45.457 --> 43:46.958
- Stop being a big baby.

43:54.883 --> 43:56.052
- What happened?

44:06.228 --> 44:07.897
- No, no, no, no, no.

44:08.022 --> 44:09.898
If I gotta eat it,
you gotta eat it.

44:11.317 --> 44:13.777
- Ma, can we have some pizza?

44:13.902 --> 44:15.945
- No.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.740
- I'll buy it.

44:17.865 --> 44:19.492
- Cisco, I'm not buying pizza.

44:20.742 --> 44:22.077
- No, just take it.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.668
- Where's this money
coming from?

44:30.377 --> 44:31.670
- Hmm?

44:31.795 --> 44:34.632
- I mean, I see
the skateboards, the clothes.

44:34.757 --> 44:35.798
The food? I mean..

44:35.923 --> 44:37.885
- We've got jobs.

44:38.010 --> 44:39.803
- Jobs?

44:39.928 --> 44:41.168
- Yeah, at the diner, you know.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.683
Twirling the sign
on the corner and stuff.

44:56.362 --> 44:57.528
- No trouble?

44:58.947 --> 44:59.947
- No trouble.

45:10.792 --> 45:12.460
- Junior, Junior, Junior!

45:12.585 --> 45:14.588
Mommy, mommy. Junior.

45:14.713 --> 45:16.090
- Boo!
- Aah!

45:16.215 --> 45:18.967
- Junior, are you kidding me?
You stop or I beat your ass.

45:19.092 --> 45:20.093
- Okay.
- Come here.

45:20.218 --> 45:22.262
- I'm sorry, ma, okay, okay.

45:23.763 --> 45:25.223
- Go apologize to her.

45:26.850 --> 45:27.893
Ma!

45:28.018 --> 45:29.520
No, I don't.
You can't play that game.

45:29.645 --> 45:31.205
- I got him.
- You can't play that game.

45:31.230 --> 45:33.440
- Get him, Stacey. Get him!

45:36.193 --> 45:38.903
- Here, oh, you're
gonna like these.

45:39.028 --> 45:40.988
They are sweet.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.950
Oh, he's getting so big,
Drey. Can I?

45:44.075 --> 45:45.915
Oh, no, he's sleeping.
No, no, no, that's okay.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.913
Oh, the sleepy face.

45:48.038 --> 45:52.250
- You got any kids?
- I have many
but none of my own.

45:52.375 --> 45:55.920
- Hey. I found him.
- Speaking of the devil.

45:56.045 --> 45:59.382
Uh, Karen, could you come in and
give them anything they want.

46:03.595 --> 46:04.930
What are you doing here?

46:05.055 --> 46:08.017
- Chino car.
I found it in the chop shop.

46:08.142 --> 46:11.018
- Car? Can't you fucking
follow directions?

46:11.143 --> 46:12.855
- Look, man, I got
the dealer out back.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.380
You want to find
your pills or what?

46:18.068 --> 46:19.110
Come on.

46:26.910 --> 46:28.120
He didn't wanna talk.

46:29.872 --> 46:31.415
- Did you let him talk?

46:33.875 --> 46:35.835
He looks fucking dead.

46:38.130 --> 46:39.923
And then you bring him
to my stand?

47:01.068 --> 47:03.863
You've no idea
where the car... came from?

47:03.988 --> 47:05.907
- No.

47:06.032 --> 47:08.368
Kids got it
before I put it on the lot.

47:13.790 --> 47:14.875
- Who are these kids?

47:16.042 --> 47:18.962
- I only know one of them.

47:19.087 --> 47:22.340
Cisco. He rides a skateboard
with his crew.

47:24.092 --> 47:25.760
- Cisco.

47:28.138 --> 47:29.890
Any idea where I can find him?

47:30.015 --> 47:33.018
- I don't know.
Fuckin' google him.

47:40.983 --> 47:45.405
Look, I told the other guy
I'll pay him back in full.

47:45.530 --> 47:46.865
Whatever the cost.

47:49.492 --> 47:52.955
- Other guy?
- Yeah.

47:53.080 --> 47:57.167
You know, some Spanish dude.
He came to my lot too.

48:10.722 --> 48:13.017
- So how'd you find this guy?

48:13.142 --> 48:15.560
- I heard he was stripping
people for parts.

48:15.685 --> 48:17.938
- Yeah. From who?

48:20.148 --> 48:21.317
- People.

48:28.073 --> 48:29.617
- Okay, well..

48:31.117 --> 48:33.453
You can keep your eye
out for this kid, Cisco.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.760
- Brought your stuff?

52:41.325 --> 52:42.493
Like these bamboo sticks.

52:42.618 --> 52:45.413
Great interpretation of

52:45.538 --> 52:47.258

You gotta fill their crib

53:15.402 --> 53:18.405
You shouldn't have swigged

53:18.530 --> 53:20.290
I'm telling you right now,

I gotta take a piss.

53:29.082 --> 53:30.375

53:42.303 --> 53:43.763
What's going on?

53:47.517 --> 53:50.437

53:50.562 --> 53:52.397

Yo, I'm done.

53:52.522 --> 53:53.922
- I mean, the pills
are almost gone.

53:54.440 --> 53:55.709
Let's, let's just
finish what we started.

53:55.733 --> 53:57.277
- Hell yeah.

53:57.402 --> 54:00.322
Making money.
I can't get enough of this shit.

54:00.447 --> 54:03.450

We're fucking bosses, yo.

54:03.575 --> 54:05.327

54:05.452 --> 54:06.535
- That's 100.

54:06.660 --> 54:08.413
- Let's just sell it
all at once.

54:08.538 --> 54:09.538
- How?

54:11.457 --> 54:12.625
- Brent.

54:12.750 --> 54:14.460
We'll sell it to Brent
and his crew.

54:14.585 --> 54:16.545
- Y'all can do that shit.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.632
Leave me out of it, bro.
I'm done.

54:18.757 --> 54:21.342
- Bro, I'm doing this for you,
so that you could skate.

54:21.467 --> 54:24.345
Matter of fact, you should be
thanking me for those shoes.

54:24.470 --> 54:26.138
And that board.
- Cisco.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.618
- Man, I'm just saying, man.
We got something here.
It's our time.

54:28.642 --> 54:30.227
We can, we can get out.

54:30.352 --> 54:32.270
- And go where, Cisco?

54:32.395 --> 54:33.795
You're really starting
to trip, man.

54:33.897 --> 54:36.440
- I see it, you could too
if you stop acting
like a little bitch.

54:36.565 --> 54:37.565
- Yo!

54:39.777 --> 54:42.322
- What?
- Chill, man.

54:43.448 --> 54:44.448
Goddamn.

54:49.495 --> 54:51.330
What we really need right now

54:51.455 --> 54:54.458
is a fucking car.

54:54.583 --> 54:57.170
'Cause this bus is
not about to come, y'all.

54:59.547 --> 55:02.217
- Oh, what a dick.
- What?

55:03.175 --> 55:04.718
- He cut the service.

55:09.432 --> 55:10.433
- Shit.

55:11.475 --> 55:12.852
- Yo, let's be out.

55:56.312 --> 55:57.605
- Oh.

55:57.730 --> 55:58.482
- What up, boy?

55:58.607 --> 56:00.567

56:00.692 --> 56:03.277

56:03.402 --> 56:06.238

56:09.075 --> 56:10.469

56:10.493 --> 56:12.412
Got some overtime.
- Alright.

56:14.580 --> 56:16.833
- Boy, you ain't,
you ain't got no clothes.

56:16.958 --> 56:19.043

56:19.168 --> 56:21.337
- What, what are you doing?
What?

56:21.462 --> 56:23.380
Oh, the festival.

56:25.258 --> 56:26.885
- Hey, here's $10.
Get yourself some pop.

56:27.010 --> 56:30.472
- No, pops, I'm good.
- Go on, take it. Get some pop.

56:30.597 --> 56:32.265
Buy that boy a shirt,

56:32.390 --> 56:33.600
Take it. Go on.

56:38.478 --> 56:39.647
- Catch you at home.

57:28.905 --> 57:30.615
- Oh, I left it at the crib.
Well, come on.

57:30.740 --> 57:31.825

57:31.950 --> 57:34.868

You're just being a dick.

57:58.685 --> 57:59.977
You got a five?

58:09.528 --> 58:11.572

58:13.365 --> 58:15.410
Where the fuck my pills

58:15.535 --> 58:18.245

Y'all motherfuckers

01:01:45.077 --> 01:01:47.830

01:01:47.955 --> 01:01:49.915
Hand it over..

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.583
We ain't got no problem.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.128
- We don't know
what y'all talking about.

01:01:55.922 --> 01:01:58.423

- Let's get these motherfuckers.

01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:18.903
- Yo, you knew about this
and didn't tell us?

01:02:19.028 --> 01:02:19.903
- They're just trying
to scare us, alright?

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:21.028
- What the fuck you mean?

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:22.698
Those bikers ain't
playing around.

01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:25.702
- They're not gonna do shit.
- What do you mean "Do shit?"

01:02:25.827 --> 01:02:28.955
They're insane! And I can't
believe you didn't tell us.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.724
- This is it, Cisco. We in
too deep. You gotta give
those pills back.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.226
- They saw our face already,
bro, it's too late for that.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.436
- No, it's not too late,
'cause we're giving
the fuckin' pills back.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.104
- Give 'em the pills back
and the money we made?

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.840
Yeah, so fuckin' smart.
Let's do that.

01:02:38.965 --> 01:02:40.340
- Cisco, chill, man.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:42.068
- Man, this whole thing was
stupid from the beginning.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.332
- No, bro, I'm done with y'all.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:44.571
I thought we was
in this together.

01:02:44.595 --> 01:02:46.013

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:48.366
Look at you, nigga.
This shit is all going

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:49.725
All you care about is yourself!

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.852
- Chill, bro.
- And? If I don't, who will?

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:53.938
Your miserable ass dad?

01:02:54.063 --> 01:02:56.023
- Yo! Yo, yo, yo!
Back off, Boobie!

01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:58.025
No, Cisco, Cisco,
we're fam, bro.

01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:59.943
- Fam? Fuck fam!

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:02.028
- Hey, fuck you!

01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:07.327
- Let's go.

01:03:07.452 --> 01:03:09.037
Let's get off these streets.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:19.963
- Shit.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.065
- I see you, C!

01:04:03.132 --> 01:04:06.010
- Happy Fourth of July,
Cleveland.

01:04:06.135 --> 01:04:08.012
Make sure you got
your swimsuit ready!

01:04:08.137 --> 01:04:10.598
- Man, turn them grills on
'cause I wanna play.

01:04:10.723 --> 01:04:12.350
- And most importantly..

01:04:12.475 --> 01:04:14.602
A whole lot of parties
going down,

01:04:14.727 --> 01:04:16.562
so make sure
you hit us up, you know...

01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:19.898
- Oh, my fucking shit, ma.
- Hey, your language.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.025
- Well, ma, how you
gonna come in like that?

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:25.738
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. Estoy bien.

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:29.825
- Bueno. I got the day
off at work.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:32.412
- So I wanna go see fireworks.
- Outside?

01:04:32.537 --> 01:04:35.413
- Yeah. Outside.

01:04:46.175 --> 01:04:49.053
- Cisco the kid.
- Bush Tits.

01:04:49.178 --> 01:04:51.013
I got some work for you.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:55.977
- Nice. Nice and calm.

01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:03.067
- How can I help you?

01:05:03.192 --> 01:05:04.943
- By turning your
air conditioner on.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:08.072
You're cooking up
your customers in here.

01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:10.365
- Nothing wrong with
a little bit of heat.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:13.618
Besides, the AC is sort of
out of commission right now.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.162
What can I get you?
Menus.

01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:17.163
- Um..

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:21.710
I don't really see
anything I can eat.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:24.088
Do you have any healthy options?

01:05:24.213 --> 01:05:26.382
- Uh, why not just
define healthy?

01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:29.052
- Oh, sorry, I didn't, I didn't
mean to be disrespectful.

01:05:29.177 --> 01:05:32.137
- I have my own business too.
- Uh-oh, competition?

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:35.057
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:39.145
Not exactly. I don't think
we're even in the same race.

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:41.105
- What's that mean?

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:43.690
- Unless there's something
else you're selling

01:05:43.815 --> 01:05:45.735
that's not on the menu.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:46.943
- Like what?

01:05:49.363 --> 01:05:52.450
- How about ice tea?
- Well, how about ice tea?

01:05:52.575 --> 01:05:55.118
'Cause what's this is,
made it myself.

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:58.998
It's chamomile,
herbal essence, tofu.

01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:04.003
- Bro... where we at?

01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:06.505
- This is where
it all goes down.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:09.008
- You're sure he's gonna cop
the whole thing, right?

01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:14.763
- Alright, playa, hold off here.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:16.098
Don't move.

01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:25.232
- My old man said,
"No more stove for me."

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:27.735
- At least, he still
gave you the diner.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.947
- Psst.

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:36.118
- Grandma's here.
- Okay.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.998
- She's gonna take you
to see the fireworks.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:44.085
You're going to have
so much fun.

01:06:48.255 --> 01:06:50.215
Go.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.675
Go on, now.

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:56.097
- Bye, honey.

01:07:14.782 --> 01:07:16.117
- Cute kid.

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:19.787
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:07:19.912 --> 01:07:22.288
- Do you have any kids?
- Me? No.

01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:25.918
I mean, I know it's hard to
understand how a fine specimen

01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:30.297
such as myself didn't
knock up a broad, but no.

01:07:30.422 --> 01:07:33.175
- Uh, it's just that,
I know a kid.

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:35.970
Cisco.

01:07:37.722 --> 01:07:39.182
I thought he was yours.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:43.602
- What kind of business
did you say you are in?

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:57.365
- Hey, Ray?

01:08:01.328 --> 01:08:03.747
Yo.

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:05.290
Guess he's not home.

01:08:07.585 --> 01:08:11.172
- That's it?
- Yeah, he's not home.

01:08:11.297 --> 01:08:12.130
- Are you serious?

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:15.092
You brought me out here
carrying this shit?

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:21.682
- Let's say you were robbed

01:08:21.807 --> 01:08:25.227
you love kids and you definitely
wouldn't want to harm anybody

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:28.604
but... it's business.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:33.027
- What, what, Cisco robbed you?
He stole from you?

01:08:33.152 --> 01:08:35.612
- Unless you're somehow
tied to this mishap?

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:37.377
- No, no, I know,
I didn't steal anything.

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:39.158
But Cisco, yeah,
you what, what..

01:08:39.283 --> 01:08:42.620
He, what did he do?
He was by.. He stole from you?

01:08:42.745 --> 01:08:45.287
- Just... tell Cisco

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:46.412
and his little friends..

01:08:48.417 --> 01:08:49.417
I want what's mine.

01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:53.255
Don't let your, your father

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.090
God rest his soul

01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:57.885
regret leaving you this diner.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.180
- Listen to me

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:07.060
you ever go near Cisco
or this diner again..

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:20.365
- Happy Fourth of July.

01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:51.313
- There go that nigga
right there.

01:09:51.438 --> 01:09:53.148
- Shit.
- Come on, get him!

01:09:53.273 --> 01:09:54.713
- Come here.
Come here, motherfucker.

01:09:57.778 --> 01:09:59.405
Hold him up, hold him up.

01:10:01.073 --> 01:10:02.115
- Ooh.

01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:38.277
- Let me see this.

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:45.158
Let's go. We good, we good.
Come on, let's go.

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:46.868
Get the fuck outta here.

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:20.527
- Pops, I can...

01:11:31.372 --> 01:11:33.498
I'm selling it to help us.

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:40.172
I just.. I don't want you to
have to take care of me, pops?

01:11:41.507 --> 01:11:43.425
- You think this helps me?

01:11:46.387 --> 01:11:50.432
I shouldn't have to explain
to you how dangerous this is.

01:11:52.517 --> 01:11:54.978
You're a grown man now.

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:59.817
Grown man who can make
your own decisions.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:06.990
But this, this leaves
my house tonight.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:12.537
And you better decide
if you gonna go with them.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.408
- You alright?

01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:05.715
- I fucked up.

01:13:10.637 --> 01:13:11.680
- Yeah, you did.

01:13:21.357 --> 01:13:23.358
- Listen, bro, you're chillin'.

01:13:25.527 --> 01:13:27.653
Your face fucked up,
but you're chillin'.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.967
- Smile.

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:34.428
- Hey, y'all's want pizza?
Ah!

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:36.640
- Yeah, yeah, let's go,
let's go have pizza.

01:15:09.255 --> 01:15:11.758
- Hi.
- I want cheese, I want cheese.

01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:15.553
- I want cheese, I want cheese.
- Ma?

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:19.432
- Can I get a cheese pizza,
half-pepperoni?

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:21.017
- Good looks, okay.

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:23.520
- Stacey...
- Hey! Sorry.

01:16:00.515 --> 01:16:02.183
- Careful.

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:27.708
- I got it.

01:16:31.713 --> 01:16:33.715
- Come on, guys, be careful.
- Yep.

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:38.012
Thank you.

01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:43.642
You care to grab the pop?

01:16:54.862 --> 01:16:56.363
- I got it.
- Yep.

01:16:58.573 --> 01:17:02.952
- Junior, Junior, mommy!
- Junior?

01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:06.707
- Junior, wake up. Junior.

01:17:06.832 --> 01:17:08.375
- Junior, stop teasing
your sister.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.377
Come on, get up.

01:17:10.502 --> 01:17:12.712
Junior, get up.

01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:15.757
- Junior!
- Junior?

01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:17.758
Junior, get up!

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:20.345
What happened?
What happened? What happened?

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:22.388
- I don't know.
- Junior, come on, wake up.

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.265
No, no, no.

01:17:25.892 --> 01:17:27.268
Oh, my God. What is it? What..

01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:30.272
No! No!

01:17:31.482 --> 01:17:33.692
No, please, Junior,
wake up, please.

01:17:33.817 --> 01:17:35.152
Junior, please!

01:17:35.277 --> 01:17:38.905
Cisco! Cisco, please!

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:40.532
Cisco!

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.852
I'm gonna put Stacey to bed.

01:18:51.978 --> 01:18:52.978
- I got it.
- I can do it.

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:56.065
- No, I got it, okay?
You can go home.

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.918
- Cisco, I said I got it.
- I... I... I can do it.

01:18:57.942 --> 01:19:01.905
- Go, Cisco! Get the fuck
out of my house already!

01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:05.617
I don't need your help, okay?
I don't need you next
to my family.

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:08.870
I don't need you around me.
I don't your fucking help,
Cisco. Now, get out!

01:19:08.995 --> 01:19:10.872
- Mom.

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:57.895
- Where's my money?

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.940
Where's my money?
- You held out on me.

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:04.987
- Where's my money, Steve?

01:21:05.112 --> 01:21:08.782
- You fucking stole it.
You brought us down, you did.

01:21:08.907 --> 01:21:12.410
You brought us down.
The money is gone. It's gone.

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:14.955
- Aah!

01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:38.562
- Here you go. Enjoy.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.862
Hey, I'll be with you
in just a second.

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.367
Okay, how can I help...

01:21:57.122 --> 01:22:01.125
I didn't know if Uncle Steve
was gonna deliver my message.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.835
- You killed my friend?

01:22:06.882 --> 01:22:08.173
- Whoa.

01:22:10.218 --> 01:22:11.218
I didn't kill anyone.

01:22:12.387 --> 01:22:14.347
- Those bikers work for you?

01:22:17.058 --> 01:22:18.560
- Shit.

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:25.025
Look, son, I didn't want
anyone to get hurt.

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:27.152
I just wanted my pills.

01:22:29.153 --> 01:22:30.780
So now what?

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:34.033
You're gonna shoot me

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:37.037
in front of all these witnesses?

01:22:37.162 --> 01:22:38.913
You're smarter than that, Cisco.

01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:43.335
- You don't know me.

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:44.960
- But I do.

01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:50.925
I'll tell you what.

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:57.140
You need to stop thinking

01:22:57.265 --> 01:22:59.850
about your mistakes

01:23:02.187 --> 01:23:04.938
and move on, hmm?

01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:07.358
No regrets in life.

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:11.487
They're just... lessons
that show you the way.

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:15.075
Aim that thing here.

01:23:16.242 --> 01:23:19.912
Handle him before he comes
after everyone you know.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.068
- Hey, yo.

01:29:06.592 --> 01:29:09.512
- You know..

01:29:09.637 --> 01:29:11.638
You and your buddies
still owe me money.

01:29:30.658 --> 01:29:32.577
- Leave them out of this.

01:29:49.135 --> 01:29:50.512
- Ride?

- Yes.

01:33:02.745 --> 01:33:04.330
