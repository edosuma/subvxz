02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Look at those feet.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Does that mean...

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah, he's going
to be a big one.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Wow.
What do you say?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Thank you.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Thanks, Sam.
You take good
care of him.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Bring him back in a couple
of weeks for vaccinations, okay?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Hi, Lydia.
Hi.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Bye now.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Bye-bye.
Thanks.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Which one did she take?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
The floppy-eared one.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
How're you doing?
I know.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Good.
Almost finished.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Want to go see
the Taj Mahal?

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I'll go anywhere with you, baby.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Oh, you picked
my favorite one.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
If I might be so bold,
I called him Bentley.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Get out of there.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
All right.
All right.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
How am I supposed to know
when my next appointment is?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh, it's in
a half an hour,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
but it's Elmer.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
If he's on time,
I'll do cartwheels.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I'd like to see that.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
No, you wouldn't.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I thought they'd be
further along.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
We've had a lot of rain.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Hey, Sam.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Lyddie.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Hi.
What's up?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Came to take a look.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
What do you think?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Nice hole.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, we've had
a lot of rain.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
That's what I said.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Can't dig in the rain.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You guys in a hurry?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
You want to fill this house
up with some babies?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yup.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Someday.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
We get some good weather,
we'll be fine.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Sure.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
I've got
the Turleys' sheep,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
and then a checkup
on Joe's pregnant cow.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Okay. Call me when
you're headed home.
Bye.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Hi, Sam.
Hi.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
How's your dog doing, Brad?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
He's looking good, Doc.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Dermatitis is
practically all gone.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah, but he's got
a rash of his own. Show him.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
He wants to use
the dog medicine.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
I wouldn't do that.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I told him that.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Why

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Not unless you want
to wake up one morning

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
barking like a dog.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
That would be
an improvement.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Wouldn't it?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
See ya.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Hey, kid!

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Get over here and help me.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Hurry!

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Come here!

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Come on!

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Get up here! Ooh!

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Tetracycline.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Campbell's hound
lacerated his paw.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Did you find it?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
No.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Where is it?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Tiny hairline fracture,
right above the joint.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Hmm.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
You don't need
reading glasses, do you?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
No.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Just wondering.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Hi.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Hey.
What's up?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh, just passing by.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I thought
I'd stop in.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Busy?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Don't mean to interrupt.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I saw her.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
How come you
didn't tell me?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I was on a call.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I saw her, too.
Down at the gas station.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Hi, Ross.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Need some help?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Elmer just showed up

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
and I've got
the Campbell dog.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Elmer's appointment
was yesterday.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
That's Elmer.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
All right.
You take him, would you?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I'll take the Campbell dog.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
What brings
you here?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
He needs a distemper shot.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
She asked about you.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
I'll catch up with her.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Trooper!

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Look what I found.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
What is it?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
What do you mean,
"What is it?"

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
A drum set, doofus.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Whose are they?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
They belonged to
an old friend of mine.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
What was his name?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Ben.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
He asked me to
keep them for him,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
because he didn't have room.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Can I play them?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Can I play them really loud?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah...

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Just do me a favor

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
and wait till
I get downstairs.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Let 'er rip!

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
So what'd you think?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
About what?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
The movie.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh, I liked it.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You did not.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Why do you say that?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
You kept looking
at your watch.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I guess I did, didn't I.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Sam, where are you?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I'm right here.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
That ought
to do it, Walter.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Just give it
a week or so.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I can't pay you
till next week, Sam.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Don't look at me.
We know where you live.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Your 3:30 cancelled.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
I guess I'll run out to Joe's,
check on that cow.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Weren't you just there
yesterday?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Yeah.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
She's very close.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
You're acting like
an expectant father.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Are you going
to hand out cigars?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Hi.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Your mom around?
No.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
She went to the store.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
My name's Sam.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm an old friend
of your mother's.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I used to live next door.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
This was my house, right here.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
That was my room, right there.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
I see you're quite
the basketball player.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Mm.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
How about that?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Well...

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
I'll just...

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I'll come around
another time.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Okay, Joe.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I'll tell him.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Okay.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Okay!

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Where's Sam?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Oh, I don't know.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
He said he was going to
check on Joe Lieber's cow.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Maybe she's already
had her calf.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Well, she did.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
But Sam wasn't there.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Where'd you go?

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Well, I had to go
check on Joe's cow.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Joe called.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
The cow had her calf.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
He said you
weren't there.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Ah, I didn't make it, so...

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
How come?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Is Sam back?

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Oh, Sam, someone
wants to see you.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Right.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
I think we've solved
the mystery.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
That dog's cute.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Hi, Sam.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Kind of expected
a bigger hello.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
I'm... surprised to see you.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Trooper, is this
the guy who stopped by?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Mm-hmm.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Well, I-I heard that
you were in town.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I'm just...

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
surprised.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
So, you already met
my son, Trooper.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
No, not officially.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm Sam.
Hi.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Dude, what do you do
when somebody

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
offers you
their hand?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
And what else?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Nice to meet you.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Nice to meet
you, too.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I told Troop that
you were a veterinarian,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
and he wanted
to come by right away

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
'cause he loves animals.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Is that right?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Well...

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I might know a puppy
who needs a home.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I don't suppose
you'd be interested?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Please, Mom?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Mmm, well...
Come on.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
you have to take care of him.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I will. Come on.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
All right.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Just wait
right here.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Do you even know how
to take care of a dog?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
What are you gonna do?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Made a deal.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
A gummy bear!

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
You want another?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Okay.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I'm Rosemary.
Trooper.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Ah.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Oh...

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Sam.
Oh.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Hey... oh...

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
What's his name?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
No, it's up to you.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
Thanks, Sam-- I think.
Just be good to him--
bring him back here

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
whenever he needs anything;
it'll be on the house.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I'll take good care of him. Hey!

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh, come on. Oh...

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Good girl.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Hi, Alice.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Go ahead and take her
on back to number two.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I'll be there
in a minute.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Yes, I...
Alice?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It's me, Dee Dee.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Dee Dee Michaud?

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah. And this is
my son, Trooper.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Well, hello, Trooper.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Why, my goodness,
I haven't seen you since...

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah. About 13 years.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Are you just visiting?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
No. I'm here to stay.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
Well... good for you.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Sam, I-I can see
that you're busy--

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
we'll catch up later?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Okay.
Okay.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Trooper!

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Thanks for the puppy.
You're welcome.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Bye, Rosemary.
Good-bye.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Give him a good home.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I will.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Why didn't you just tell me
the truth at the office?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I didn't want
Rosemary gossiping.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
About what?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
About Dee Dee.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
What about Dee Dee?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Oh, just... nothing.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
You were worried she'd
gossip about nothing?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
We were friends.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
We grew up together--
I mean, I've known

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
the girl since I was
three years old.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
She and Ross
and I hung out.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I mean, she was fun.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Fun?

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
We were just
friends, okay?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
People gossip
about friends here.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It's a small town, Lydia.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
What do you know
about small towns--

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
you grew up in Boston.
Oh, I don't know, Sam,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
why don't you tell me
what it's like to grow up

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
in a small town.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Tell me about your "friend."
What do you mean?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't know.
What's she like?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
She was a free spirit.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
'Kay? Everybody in town
knew her.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
Me, I was this shy little kid
afraid of his own shadow.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Once there was
this kid who was...

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
sort of the neighborhood bully,
he stole my baseball cards.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Now, I pretended
that it didn't matter,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
but it mattered to Dee Dee.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
She found him,
she beat him up,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
and she got 'em all back for me.
Oh, that was nice of her.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
But you know what,
she didn't even care

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
about what people thought
about her.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
In the ninth grade,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
she gets caught smoking
in the school bathroom.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
The principal

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
takes her into his office.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Before he can even
get a word in,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
she offers him a cigarette.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Mm-hmm.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Anyway...

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
on graduation day, she ran off

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
with Bobby Langford.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Could you pass me
the olive oil?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Is she the one

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
you were gonna give
your class ring to?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Who told you that?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Ross.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
A long time ago.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah. She was the one.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Pass me the pepper?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Not until you tell me.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Nothing to tell.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Try me.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Well, I was planning on
giving her my class ring

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
the night before
graduation.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
We were standing
out on her porch,

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
and I had it out,
I had it in my hand,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
and I'm about to give
it to her, but before
I could say anything,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
she pops out with the
news that she's going.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Next day, gone.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You never heard from her?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Couple of postcards.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Uh, one.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
From some small
town in Kansas.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Home of the world's
biggest ball of twine.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
"Ain't life a hoot?"

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
That's what it said,
nothing more.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
How come
you never mentioned her?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
I didn't think it
was that important.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
It's just that
she was your first crush.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I mean, if my first
boyfriend came into town...

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Look, I...

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
I got over it.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
I married this woman that
I am absolutely crazy about.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Really

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Eh, you'd have to know her.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Is she pretty?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Pretty? No.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Movie-star beautiful.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Smart as a whip.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
And let's see...
terrific veterinarian.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Did I mention that?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Loved by people
and pets alike.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
I think we should
ask them to dinner.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Really?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
You got to know
the competition.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Oops.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Hi!
Hey, Dee Dee,
Trooper.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Lydia.
Nice to meet you.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Hi. Nice to meet you, too.
This is Trooper.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Hi, Trooper.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Hi.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Hi. It is really nice

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
to meet you.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Well, come on inside.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
This is for you.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh. Thank you.
Should I open it now?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Sure.
Okay.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Oh, they're lovely.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I'm glad you like them.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
I made them.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Uh, they're beautiful.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
We can use them
tonight at dinner.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I'm still working
in the kitchen.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Oh, good.
Let me help you.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
What are you making?
Nothing fancy.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Some roasted chicken,
mash potatoes, carrots.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Nut?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Okay.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Oh, I love candlelight dinners.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Mmm, me, too.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Maybe you'll be
a customer.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
A customer?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I'm gonna open up
a candle shop.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Here?
Is that a bad idea?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Well, no...
it's not a bad idea.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
But...?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
He's such a terrible liar.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
He's learning.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Well, I just...
wonder if it's, uh,

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
if the town is
large enough for a...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
a candle store.
Yeah, I thought
of that, but...

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
I figure if I offer
candle-making lessons,
you know.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
What do you think
Lydia?

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Oh, I-I think you'll just
have to try it and see.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Well, would you be interested?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Me? I don't have
that much free time.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
So, how did you get interested

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
in candle

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
Oh, you know, it started
as a hobby, but then

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
I had to make a living.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
And, uh... I guess I just love
what candles symbolize.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Which is what?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Home.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I guess hopes

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
and dreams and wishes.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
People light candles in church.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
They use them
for prayer.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Dude,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
you can't just eat
before everybody starts.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
No, it's okay. It's okay.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Dig in.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
So, Trooper...

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
how'd you get the
nickname "Trooper"?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
It's not a nickname.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
It's my real name.
We've traveled around

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
so much, we're like
a small theater troupe.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
So you spell it with a "U"?

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Hmm?
T-R-O-U-P-E-R.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
No...

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
T-R-O-O-P-E-R.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
I gave him the name,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
so I figure he can
spell it however he wants.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Well, not really.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
Oh. Yeah, that's right, because
last year you wanted to spell it

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
with three O's.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Troop, weren't you gonna
ask Sam something?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Oh, yeah.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Uh...

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
do you have lots
of animals downstairs?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
We sure do.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Can I see 'em?

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Sam, why don't you take Trooper
down and show him our zoo.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Good.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
All right,
come on, Troop.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Can I call you Troop?
If you want to.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Everybody
calls me Sam.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
He's a nice boy.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Yeah.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
He reminds me
of Sam.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
Shy at first, but there's
a lot going on underneath.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I understand you're living
in your childhood home.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Yeah. Lots of
memories there.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
What brings you back
after all this time

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
My mom died, and the house

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
was just sitting there.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
But mostly for Trooper--
I keep boring him

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
with all my stories of how
great it was to grow up here.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
How'd you and Sam meet?

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Oh, at Cornell, in vet school.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
He always wanted
to be a vet.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
I guess you knew him
pretty well.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
Yeah. Hard not to--
he lived next-door.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
We spent every
day together.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Especially in
the summertime.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
So you moved back here
after vet school?

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
I was a city girl
pining for country life.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Slower pace,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
nicer people.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
You must have a lot
of friends here.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Yeah, I... I guess I do.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
But you married my best one.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
Well, this is where we operate.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Is there a lot
of blood and stuff?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Sometimes.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
How's that puppy
doing, by the way?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Oh, he's fine.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
What do you
call him?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Chewbacca.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Nice name.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
How did you come up with that?

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
He tried to eat
my shoelaces.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
Are all these yours?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
No. They all belong
to other people.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
Except this
little guy.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
Actually, this is
Chewbacca's brother.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Want to see him?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Sure.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Do you get to
play with them?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It's kind of hard
to find the time.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Thank you.
Dinner was so good.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
You're welcome.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Do you want me to
walk you guys home?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Nah. We know the way.
Don't bother.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Go ahead, Sam.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
I'll be right back.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Got it?
Yep.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Remember that
bike I bought

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
with berry-picking
money?

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
The one you sold
to Jimmy Farrington?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I wish I had it back.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
I'd give it to Troop.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
What's wrong
with the one he has?

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Nothing. Just
pure nostalgia.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Nostalgia?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Coming from the woman who could
not wait to get out of here.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
It's funny,
isn't it?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Guess it's true
you never appreciate

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
what you have
until it's gone.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Hey, Trooper.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
This is Cee Jay's--
that place I told you about.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Same old place.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Same old geezers.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Except now I'm one of them.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Where's his dad?

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Troop never knew his dad.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
He was less than
a year old when Bobby left.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Bobby?

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Yeah.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Where did he go?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Alaska.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
He never really
wanted kids.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
I can't say that
I'm surprised.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Sam, is that a polite way
of saying, "I told you so"?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
How about
you and Lydia?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
Any plans for kids
in the future?

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
Kids? Yeah. Someday.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I just want
to be sure.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Sure about what?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
We're financially
secure.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
That we're ready.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Time to devote
to a family.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
You haven't
changed a bit, Sam.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I guess not.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
I wish I were
more like you.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Never thought I'd
hear you say that.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Oh, shut up.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
I have learned something
in the last 13 years.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
Last few nights, I can't sleep.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
I wake up, I go to my window
and look out at your window.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
It used to make me
so comfortable,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
just knowing
you were there.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm so sorry, Sam.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
I'm sorry
I fell off the map.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Bobby and I
married right away.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Trooper came
a year later.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
I'm not making excuses, but...

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I do really apologize.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
No need.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
It's kind of hard for Troop,
you know,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
moving again to a new place.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
He's got to make new friends.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
He seems
like a great kid.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
You know,
in the meantime,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I could use some help
around the clinic.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
Someone to feed and
look after the animals.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
He would love that.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Thank you, Sam.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I... I... I have
to make trips

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
back and forth
to Boston...

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
This is perfect.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
What are you doing in Boston?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh, I have to pick up supplies.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
Umm... Lydia seems great.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah, she is great.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
I guess I got lucky.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
I hope you don't mind.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
No, it's fine.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
It'll be good for him.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
And good practice
for you.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
You okay
about tonight?

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
Yeah. It wasn't as awkward
as I had imagined.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
She seems nice enough.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
So, you check the brand
of the food

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
with the amounts
on the card,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
and then you feed them
out of the right one.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Okay.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Which one is it?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
This one here.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
When you're working
with a puppy,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
sometimes they
can be tentative.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
You want to try to coax
them into a behavior

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
with a reward--
a treat--

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
like this,
so we want

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
to have him come
down the stairs,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
but keep your hand here
so they don't fall.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Come on, sweetness.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Can I play with them
after I feed them?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Oh, I'd say that's
a big part of the job.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Really?
Uh-huh.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
You got to feed
them first. Here.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Wait, no. Hey. No.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Reach right in. They're
not going to come out.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
There you go.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Come on. Yeah!
Okay. There you go.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Do you want to
give him the treat?

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Yeah.
Okay.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Reward him.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Come on. Here you go.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Good job.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
What's the dog's name?
Jesse.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Hi, Jesse.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Hey, girl.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Perfect, except he's a boy.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Oh. Sorry, Jesse.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Here. Come here.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Oh, good.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Oh, I think
he likes you.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
He likes me.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
He does.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Now, don't be
nervous now,

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Naomi.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
It's just the entire
fate of the game.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Oh.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
This isn't over.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Better luck next time,
sweetheart.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Excuse me.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Go. It's your turn.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
How's the
house coming?

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
It's just a hole
at the moment.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Rick's as slow
as molasses.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Took him a year to do
my Uncle Ned's place.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
He's careful.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
And Ned has a great house.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Oh, and Sam
likes careful.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Boy, does he ever.
Yeah, well, if you
don't push him,

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
it'll be your retirement home.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Push who

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Rick.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Come to think
of it, Sam, too.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
You better push
them both, Lyddie.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
What's the hurry?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Funny you should ask.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Hey, Cee Jay,
you got anything

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
to read while
we're waiting?

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Oh! Tell me you weren't

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
sleeping through that,
were you?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Sorry. I missed it.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Oh. You weren't sleeping,
were you?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Mom?
What?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
What are these?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
What?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
These.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Where did
you find them?

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
In the drawer
in the kitchen.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
That's Sam.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
That's Sam?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
He's so serious.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Grr!
He's kind of chubby.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Who's this?

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Your dad.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Can I keep it?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Sure.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Here. Put these back.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
This is 154 degrees in here.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
But don't worry.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
You can stick your finger
in here,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
and it kind of feels good.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
You won't get hurt.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Umm... Okay.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
The key to making candles
is you can't hurry.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
You have to have patience.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
When I use that word
with my son,

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
he rolls his eyes at me,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
but I guess that's payback

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
for all the times
I did that to my mom.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
Okay. So each of us needs
to take a wick.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Thank you.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
You want to hold it
in the middle and, uh...

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
just keep it apart

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
so that it doesn't
get stuck together.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
Dipping candles are made
a pair at a time.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Now, dip the wick
into the heated wax.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
How long do you leave it in?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Oh, just trust your gut.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
It's kind of like

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
cooking without
a recipe.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
A recipe?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
What's that?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
So you want to put it in
for, like,

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
I don't know, three seconds,

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
and then keep it out
for about three seconds.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
And then we're going
to cool them off

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
for about
three minutes.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I know that they look
kind of skinny.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
Skinny

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
That's what he said!
That's what he said.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Lydia! Hi.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Hi.
Hi, Lydia.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I was just passing by.
I thought I' d...

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Oh, come on in.
I'm so glad
that you came.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Well...
Oh, come on, Lyddie.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
This is fun.
I'm just not so crafty.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Oh, we all aren't.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
So...

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
when I sell my candles,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I like to put a little message
in each box.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
If you're going to be
using them as gifts,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
you might want to do the same.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Like what?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I think

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
candles help us
explore the darkness.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
You know?

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
People used to sit
around campfires,

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
keep the predators away.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I think

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
firelight...
makes us feel safe.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
You know? I do.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Can you imagine?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
There were, like,
a half dozen of us...

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
all women... gathered...

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
learning how
to make these candles.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
It was kind of magical.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Sitting there
in that room,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I really did feel
a sense of something.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Fire hazard,
probably.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I'm serious.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
All right.
What did you feel?

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
You know, for as long
as I've been in this town,

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
I've never felt
a sense of that

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
so strongly as I did tonight.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
What?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
A sense of community.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
You know, I really do like her,

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
much more
than I thought I would.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Good.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
Tell you the truth,
I was a little jealous of her.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
No kidding.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
You knew?

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Oh, please.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I just can't seem to get
him to take his pills.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Oh, well, you just
hold him like this,

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
open his jaw, take the pill,
and put it back like that.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Lyddie, the Frieden mare
is having trouble foaling.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I'm going
to take Trooper along.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
He up to it?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
We'll find out.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Your call, but if
he faints or heaves...

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Sorry.
We have a young helper.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Oh.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Hello, Doc.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Hey, John.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
This is my new helper.
Meet Trooper.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Hey.
Hey.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
The foal hasn't dropped
into the birth canal.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
She could start to lose
blood supply soon.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
All right,
hand me my kit.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Put it right here.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Yeah.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
Okay, Sophie,
Be a good girl.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
This is known as the
jugular groove, see?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
It's easy to find.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
You just trace from the jaw
angle down the neck.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I like to go in
towards the north.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I press here.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
See that?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
It increases the blood
pressure in the vein.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
That'll take effect
in a few minutes,

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
be less
dangerous for her--

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
and for us.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Okay.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
The foal is in a good position.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Have both forelegs
extended forward,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
one a little less so
than the other,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
with the chin resting
on the knees.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
Now, if the neck was
flexed to either side,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
the foal could get his head
caught on the way out,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
which would be... trouble,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
but this one
looks fine so far.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
The only worry is
how long it's taking.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
See the tiny
little hooves there?

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
Bottom's downward,
towards the mother's feet.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
We'd better move
things along here

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
and apply a little traction.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
All right.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
In my kit is a set of OB chains.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
They're shiny, narrow,
stainless steel.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Do me a favor and
go get them. Go.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Sit down.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Since they're looped
just above the ankles,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
it's not going to
hurt when we pull.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
All right.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
When she pushes, we pull.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Ready?

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Pull.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Okay. Stop. Stop.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Okay. Wait

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
for the contraction.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
This is the most difficult part.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Pull!

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Good. Good and hard.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Oh. Okay.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
All right.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Wow. Wow.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Wow.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Hey, thanks, Doc.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
If he isn't up and
nursing in an hour,

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
give me a call.
Yeah, I'll
do that.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I'll do that.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Hey, that's some
little helper you've got here.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Sure is.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Yeah.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Good job.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Thanks. Oh.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Oh. Thank you.
Your shirt.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
See you, John!

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Take care, Doc.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Trooper, right?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Yeah.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
I'll see ya.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
You did a good job.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I was a little scared.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Nothing wrong
with being scared.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
You hung in there.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Come on.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Sam?

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
Yeah?

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Did you know
my dad?

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Your dad?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Oh, I didn't know
him really well.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
He was only
in town for a year.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
What was he like?

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Well, let's see.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
He was a cool guy.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
I could say that.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
My mom says he was a dreamer.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
You could say that.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
He left us to go to Alaska.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
Dreamers have to
follow their hearts.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
They sure do.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Come on.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
The kid thinks he's
some sort of romantic hero.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
I couldn't even believe
what I was hearing.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
A dreamer?

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Come on.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
The guy was a lowlife
who abandoned them.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Maybe you were just a little
jealous of him, Sam.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Lyddie,
the guy spent

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
half the year he was
here working on his car,

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
the other half dealing pot.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
How do you
romanticize that?

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
What if she's just
protecting her son?

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
By lying to him?

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
If he were your son,
what would you say?

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
I don't know.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
Well, looky!

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Hey, Cee Jay.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
How you doing?

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I heard you were
back in town.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Yeah. You want to check
my ID for old times' sake?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Darling, you
never had an ID.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
That's how come I used
to throw you out of here.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Nice to have you back.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
It's nice to be
here-- legally.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Hey.
Hey, we were
wondering

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
if you were
going to show up.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Yeah, I know.
I had to drive to Boston

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
to pick up supplies
for the candle business.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Oh! Candlemania
sweeps the town.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
I know.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Even Rosemary joined the group.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Oh, no. Where
will it end?

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Maybe it won't.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Everything ends.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Hey, Cee Jay,
can we get another glass?

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
You know what?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
We have three-fourths
of the band here.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
What band?

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Sam's band.
Oh, it wasn't

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
my band, it was Dee Dee's.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
I didn't know
you had a band.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
I didn't.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
I wouldn't have even
been in the band

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
if Dee Dee hadn't
of browbeaten

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
the others
into taking me.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
What did you play?

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Guitar.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
If you call
that playing.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
I don't.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Come on, Sam.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
People liked you.
Because you did.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
If Ben and Ross
and I would have

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
started the
band on our own,

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
it would have lasted
five minutes.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Hey, I was good.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Yeah.
You were
awful.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Dee Dee, she
was, was good.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
When did Ben move?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Um... a couple
of years ago.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I think he went
up to Dallas.
Yeah.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Do you still sing, Dee Dee?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Yeah.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
It drives Trooper crazy.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
So. How about a song?

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
Yeah.
Oh, we don't have Ben.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Unless you want
to do Ben's part.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Are you kidding?

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Sam, you never sang for me.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Profoundly good reason.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000

life of the party ♪

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Hey, kid!

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
It's too late for drums.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Go to bed.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Guess what I did today?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
What's that?

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I delivered a horse.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
All by yourself?

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
No, not by myself,
but I helped.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Yeah?

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
It was so cool!

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
And guess what else?

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Sam...

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
he said my dad was
a really cool guy.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Oh.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Yeah.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Yeah, really cool.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Just like you,

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Mr. Horse Doctor.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Now go to sleep!

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I love you, Mom.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
I love you, too, baby.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Here's your friend.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
'Night.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Good night, angel.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
See you in the morning.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
Hey, let's go to sleep, okay?

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Guys, give me a hand
with the wall?

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Let's get it up.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
Would you like some coffee, sir?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Good. Okay, slide it.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Looks good, Rick.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
When do you
think the framing
will be finished?

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
It's hard to say.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Can you give us a guess?

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Well... That's good.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Not really.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Well, by fall?

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Early fall or late fall?

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Any fall.

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
Depends, really.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Well, if we get
into the winter

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
and the house
isn't finished...

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Yeah, it could happen.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Wouldn't that hurt
the house?

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Not really. Why?

48:19.000 --> 48:24.000
I'd just prefer it
if it didn't fall
down in a heap.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Picky, picky.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
Hey, Doc.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
How's that colt doing?

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Oh, fit and fine,
like last week.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Not used to seeing
so much of you.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Thank my assistant
for that.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Oh...

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
What's his name?

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
I don't have one yet.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
Got any ideas?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Solitaire.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Huh. Pretty good.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
How come you
picked that one?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
He doesn't have anyone
to play with.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
Well, then that's
what we'll call him.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
Solitaire.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Quick, quick, quick!

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
Mom, it's my fault.
Look at him!

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
No, it's not,
sweetheart.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
I should have been there!

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Honey, it's okay.
Come on.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Come on. They'll
fix him right up.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Cody got hit by a car.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
Oh, my. Here, bring
him on back. Sam!

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
What does it look like?

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Crushed lumbar vertebra.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
Spinal cord damage
looks irreversible.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
Abdomen's full of fluid,
probably a ruptured spleen.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
Maybe I'll take Amber outside
while you talk to Val.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Okay.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Do you want to go come
outside with me?

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Hi.
Hi.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
Want to go over
the X rays?

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
No, that's okay.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
It looks bad, Val.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
Is there anything we can do?

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
Well... we could try to save
him, but it'll be painful

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
and I can't give you
any guarantees.

50:37.000 --> 50:43.000
What would you do
if he were yours, Sam?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I think I'd let Cody go.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Okay.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
I'm going
to talk to Amber.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Sure.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
I'll let her come
and say good-bye.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
You're just going
to let him die?

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Well, I'd do anything
if I could save him,

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
but he's been hurt
pretty badly

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
and he's in a lot
of pain.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I don't think we should
let him suffer like that.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Troop, where are you going?

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Hi.
Hey.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Is Troop home?

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Yeah, he's upstairs.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Can I speak with him?

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
I want to explain
something to him.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I already talked to him.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
He's pretty upset.
Come on in.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
It isn't just about
the puppy, Sam.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
What is it?

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
You know, I've been

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
making trips back
and forth to Boston.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Hm-hmm.

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
It's not to pick up supplies.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
I've been going to a hospital.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
What for?

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
Cancer.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
I'm dying, Sam.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
It's widespread.

52:30.000 --> 52:36.000
It's in my lymph nodes,
bone marrow,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
liver.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
You must have had
treatment.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Yeah.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
It's just
a matter of time.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
How much time?

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
I was hoping to make it
to Troop's 12th birthday,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
but it's moving too fast.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Does he know?

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
More or less.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
But he's hoping.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
I haven't told him the latest.

53:06.000 --> 53:12.000
Sorry. It's really why
I came home.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
So you can die here?

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
No, I want Trooper to live here.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
I need to find him

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
a place, a family.

53:22.000 --> 53:26.000
I had this crazy idea.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
I built this place up
in my mind, you know?

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It seemed
so magical to me

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
and I thought all I had to do
was come home.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
Clearly, I haven't
learned a thing

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
'cause when I was 18
I thought everything outside

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
of this town was magical,
and I just had to leave.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
How about his dad?

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
Oh, come on.
You've never liked him.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
You were right.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
He got into drugs
and dealing,

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
and it only got worse
as time went on.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
After Troop was born,
he took off for Alaska.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
Said he had to get work.

54:09.000 --> 54:15.000
He, um, got busted
and did two years.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
Then when he got out,
he went right back to it.

54:19.000 --> 54:25.000
He got himself killed,
and I never found out how.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
I chose so badly, Sam,

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
not just for myself,
but for Troop.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
Aw, Dee Dee.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I'm so sorry.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
I know.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I know you are.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I need your help, Sam.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
I have no one else.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Anything.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.000
I need you to help me find
a place for Troop.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
Please?

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
I just sat there with this
stupid look on my face.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I felt like such an idiot.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
But I didn't know what to say.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
What are you going
to do?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I don't know.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Look for somebody,
I guess.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
But who?

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
I thought
of John Frieden.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
John Frieden?

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
Yeah. He likes Trooper.
He's got horses...

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
He's over 60 years old.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
50-something.
And Trooper would love
being on a farm.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
What does he know about
raising boys these days?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
They raised two kids.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
That was over ten years ago.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
His kids are married.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
They have families
of their own.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
You think he's forgotten how?

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
No, but raising kids
these days

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
is a lot different
than it was then.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
It was just a thought.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Sam?

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Mm?

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I was thinking last night.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Yeah? So was I.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
About what?

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
Going over the names
of everyone I know.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
We could take him.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
No, we couldn't.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Why not?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
It wouldn't work,
Lyddie.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Where we going
to put him?

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
We're building a house.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
She doesn't think she's
going to make it that long.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
We have a spare room.
We can fix it up.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
It's not a practical idea.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
Why not?

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Because we're not set up for it.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
We both work.
Who's going to look after him?

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
You have to make plans
for things like this.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
It takes time.
Oh, come on, Sam.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
I don't think this decision
is about being practical.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
We've thought about this
for one night, okay?

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
It's a huge responsibility.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
We've thought about having
kids for a long time.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
What about Val?
I think Val's a good idea.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
Her husband's out of work.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
I don't think she can.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Well, then there's
the Grubers.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
There's, there's
lots of people.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Why don't we just see
how she does?

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Maybe she's wrong.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
She could live
for another year.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
She could live
for two years.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
In the meantime,
I've got to go

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
inoculate the Holden
pigs, okay?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
We'll find somebody.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Hi, Trooper.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
Hey. Is Sam here?

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
He'll be back soon.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Lydia,

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
I'm sorry
I ran off like that.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
It wasn't very
professional of me.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Well, you know,

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
I could use some professional
help with this fellow.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
You want to hold him?
Hold him by the collar.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Okay.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Give him some comfort.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Sunny's having
his operation, huh?

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
Yup.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Is he going
to be okay?

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
He'll be great.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
That's good. I was worried.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
You ever think
of having more kids?

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Beyond the two
little hellions

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
we're raising now,
you mean?

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
Yeah.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
Why do you ask?

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Just wondering.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
You been talking to Naomi?

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
No. About what?

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
Lydia been talking
to Naomi?

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Not that I know of. Why?

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
Naomi's pregnant.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Congratulations.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Thanks,

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
but I don't know how
we're going to do it.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
We're barely making it
now on two teachers' salaries.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
Yeah, it's not easy.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
You and Lydia
thinking of...?

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
No. Not yet.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
You still remember how?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
It'll come back to me.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
Sam, come on.
What'd you ask me for?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
For Dee Dee.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Sorry I'm late.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Oh, you're
never too late.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
We were just going to start
to read our messages

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
we're putting
into our gift boxes, right?

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
Rosemary, do you want
to go first?

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Oh, sure,
it's always me.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
Oh, this is for
my brother-in-law Jack,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
who is a real... pill.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Well, he is.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
"Jack be nimble,

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
"Jack be quick,

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
"Jack jump over
the candlestick.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
"But don't burn
your rear

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
"or you will see

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
exactly the pain
you are to me."

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
Not exactly what I had
in mind, but it works.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
You don't know Jack.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Don't get excited.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Remember last week
when the cat, like,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
went through an alarm
and went all over the place.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
It happens all the time.
Constantly.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Doc... it's
your new house.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Come on, Dennis,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I'll give you a ride...
Oh no!

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I'm so sorry, Lydia.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It's just the framing.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
It's not even a house, yet.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
It's a dream.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Maybe we can dream it again.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I kept the generator
going to run the pump.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I was afraid it was
going to flood.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
It must have been
an electrical short.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I'm sorry.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's not your fault, Rick.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
It was an accident.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
When can we
start rebuilding?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I'll have to clean
this mess up.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Labor Day is coming soon.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I say we wait
until spring.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Once the bad
weather starts
we're just

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
going to have to stop.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
What do you think, Sam?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Sam?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Talk to me.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I had Rick do the house because
he's so... meticulous.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Every nail, every joint,
every angle...

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
just so.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I had him prepare
the house for a hurricane.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Did I tell you that?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
When was the last time there was

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
a hurricane around here?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I don't know.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
A hundred years?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
He was going
to truss the gables,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
reinforce the garage door,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
put a special adhesive
on the shingles...

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
You can't protect
against everything.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Not everything.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
But everything you
can think of.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
But you can't think
of everything either.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
It was a freak accident.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
My mother was so afraid
of hurricanes.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I don't blame her.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Nah, she was afraid
of pretty much everything.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Every time my dad would
leave on a sales trip,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
he'd make sure we had
everything we needed.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Check the tires,
check the house,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
the rain gutters,
the shutters,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
did we have enough firewood,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
and on and on and on.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And still, this woman,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
she was afraid.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Of what?

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Oh, you name it.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I used to hear her walking
around the house late at night,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
making sure all the windows
were locked.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And every time
I'd leave the house,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
my mother would ask me
if I had enough money?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Where are you going?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Are your socks warm enough?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I used to think I could
actually hear...

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
her worrying.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
It got to the point
where I didn't even
want to leave the house.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
It was easier
just to stay at home.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
If it hadn't been for Dee Dee,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I probably would have never
left the yard.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
She sounds like she was
a good friend to have.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
She was more than that.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
She was my friend,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
my sister...

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Do you...

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
do you think I'd be
a good father?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Sam, yes.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Yes, I do.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Then let's take him.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Are you sure?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Hi.
Hi.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Hey.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Can we come in?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Sure.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
What's up?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Where's Troop?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
He's upstairs playing
with Chewbacca.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
We want to take him.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Are you sure?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Yeah.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
When the time comes.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
We're still hoping it won't.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I don't know what to say.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
You don't have
to say anything.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I couldn't have even
hoped for this.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Oh, Sam, I'm so
proud of you.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Oh, we're both crazy about him.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
That's great, but that's not
why I'm proud of you.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Okay, why are
you proud of me?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Because you married well.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I want to have a party.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
A big one.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
A party?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Might be my last chance.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Hey, Trooper, can I come in?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Uh-huh.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Did you have fun

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
with Rosemary today?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Mm-hmm.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Want to snuggle?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Remember how we always
said we'd hope

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
for the best when
I got sick?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Yeah.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Well, sometimes the best
doesn't happen.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
And then, we have
to make other plans.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
We have to make the best
of things as they are.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
So, it looks like the best
isn't going to happen.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And if I'm not going
to be around...

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
...if I'm not
going to be around,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
we're going to have to find
a place for you, Troop.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I don't want to.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I know, baby.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
But we got to make
the best of things, don't we?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Maybe... maybe
my dad will come back.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Oh, Troop.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
He, he could.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
It's been a
very long time.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But he still could, Mom.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
But in the meantime,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000
we have to find a place for you
where you'll be safe and happy.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Where people love you.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And they'll take
care of you.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
You know, Sam and Lydia?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
They love you very much.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Do you know that?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I know it.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Do you know how I know it?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
'Cause they said that if
anything happened to me,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
if I didn't get
better,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
that they'd love to
have you live with them.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
How would you feel
about that?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I don't want to, Mom.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I know, baby.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
But as long as
we're talking about

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
making the best of things...

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
can you think of a place
you'd rather be?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Do you like them, Troop?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I like them very much.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
In fact, I can't think of
anyone I'd rather you be with.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Can you?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Can we still hope?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Hope what?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
That you'll get better.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Come here.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Yeah, we can still hope.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I'm still going
to hope then.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Me, too.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Have you been
taken care of?

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Did you get something?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Oh, you did get something.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Excellent.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Who else?
Who else needs their drinks?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I'm going to sit down.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Yeah, go sit down.
Go on.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I'll, I'll fix the table.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I'll keep it going.
Go on.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
for one night only,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
we present the return

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
of...Dee Dee and the Deadbeats.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Dee Dee, would you do us
the great honor

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
of leading us
through our theme song?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Oh, Sam.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Come on.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I'm sorry.
I can't.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I want to watch you guys. Go.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
What's the name
of the song?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
"You've Got a Friend."

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Oh, I know that one...

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Well, get up here.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Go get them.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Yay, for me.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
And we do have a special guest
on the drums tonight...

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Mr. Trooper Michaud!

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Yay, Trooper!

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
What key do you guys play in?

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
What key do you
sing it in?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Oh, it doesn't matter.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000

Whoa!
What is that?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
A little welcome home present.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
It's huge!

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Well, open it!

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Open it, Dee Dee!
Come on.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Okay,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
okay.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
You got it?
Give her help.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Yeah, you got it,
you got it.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Rip that sucker open!

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
There.
There you go.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
All right.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
All right.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Hey...

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Look at that.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
My bike!

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Where did you find it?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Well, I thought Jimmy
Farrington had it

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
but he'd sold it to
Marty and Neil Halfon.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Neil thought
Marty had it.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Marty thought
Neil had it, but they

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
both forgot that they gave
it to their little sister,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
and it was in
her basement,

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
collecting cobwebs.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
But it looks brand new.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
That's just a new seat
and some fresh paint.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Troop, this is the bike I rode
when I was your age.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
It's... it's cool.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Well, sort of.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Excuse me,
it's the coolest bike ever.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I'm going to take it on a ride.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Move it.
Let me help you.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Move it.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Okay, I got it,
I got it.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
All right now.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Don't go crazy all at once,
you know.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Shut up, you guys.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
We'll find a place
over here.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I put it into first gear,
so, you know...

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Okay, yeah, Ross.
I've ridden a bike before.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Okay, well, this is
just like that.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
All right.
Thank you.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Okay.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Whoa! Whoa!
Go, Dee Dee.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Sam, maybe
she shouldn't.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Well, you should
know her by now.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Whoo!

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Hey, Rick.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Hey.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
How's the
clean up coming?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Ah, it's coming.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I want to start
the new construction.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
You mean now?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Right away.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Soon as you're finished
with the clean up.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I don't know if it
makes sense, Sam.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I mean, we'll be caught
right in the middle of winter.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Ah, let's take a chance.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
We might have
decent weather.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
What if we don't?

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Then we'll shut it
down till spring.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
But then we'll be left
with all this material

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
just hanging around
all winter.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
It's not going
to hurt it, is it?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Well, I...
I suppose not.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
What's the hurry?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
We're going to fill
that house up with kids.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Thanks, Rick.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Is Lyddie pregnant?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
No. Not yet.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
It takes nine months, you know.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Not always.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Amber's going to take
Chewbacca's brother.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Oh, great, Amber.
I'm glad.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Are you going to take him today?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Uh-huh.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Trooper, go bring him in.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
He'll need a shot.
Okay.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Are you going to do it now?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Yep.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Right now.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I'll come back.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Oh, it'll just
take a minute.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I hate shots.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I'll... I'll come back tomorrow.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Trooper, put him up here
on the table.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Here.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Where's Amber?
She didn't
want to watch.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Yeah, she's not
used to this stuff.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
This'll just pinch a little,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
okay, puppy?

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Ouch.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
There we go.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
You okay

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
You okay?
He's fine.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Here he is.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
There we are.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
What do you think?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Getting big.
Come on,
come on.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
You want to feed him?
Sure.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Well, grab a hold
of that bucket there.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Here we go.
Come on around here.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Here we go.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Here we go.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Hey.
Here we go.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Yeah, I'm going to have
to have somebody

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
come out and ride him
this spring,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
so he don't get too frisky.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Don't suppose you know anyone
who'd be willing to do that?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
I'd ride him

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
if I knew how.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
You would?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Yeah.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
If I knew how.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Well, now.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Here you go.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I never would have thought
that he would have done that.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Would you, Sam?
Never even
crossed my mind.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
He's awful busy,
though.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
What with being an assistant
veterinarian and all.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Oh, yeah, he probably
doesn't even have time.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Not much.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Well, I'd have time,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
it's just...
I don't really know how.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I forgot that.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Too bad.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Well, of course
there's always Sophie.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Yeah, lots of folks
learned to ride on Sophie.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Sophie's very gentle.
Very gentle.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Sort of like sitting
in an easy chair.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Well...

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I'll keep looking.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Hey, say, you know,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
I just got an idea.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Now if you wanted
to come and learn

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
on Sophie...

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Yeah, I would.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Well, how about that,
I think we got a deal.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Well, son of a gun, I wish
I'd thought of that before.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Well, you come on back
any time and we'll

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
get started.
Okay.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Ain't that something?

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Never even thought
about old Trooper.

One, two....

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Are you okay?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Yeah.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
All in?
Uh-huh.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Everyone in?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Where are we going?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
You'll see.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I bet it's
the Labor Day picnic.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Maybe.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Maybe not.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
What's the big surprise, Sam?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
It wouldn't be a surprise
if I told you,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
now, would it?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
(electric saw whirring,
hammers pounding)

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
How about that?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Sam, I didn't think
that we could...

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
We took a chance.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
We've been working overtime.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I talked the guys into
coming in over the holidays.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Thanks, Rick.
Okay.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
All right, you,
walk the plank.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Rick.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Thank you so much.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
The guys wanted to help--
they're good guys.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Here we have
the living room...

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
kitchen...

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
bedrooms...

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
family room.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I wanted you to see it.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Thank you, Sam.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Well, in case
it burns down again.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
We need 16 more
four-by-eight sheets

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
to complete the outside
sheathings, so I'll call...

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Will this be my room?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
It'll be all yours.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Do you want to put
a bunk bed in here?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Nah.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
A single?

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Whatever you want.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I bet you'll be able

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
to have a really nice
view of some stars.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Yeah.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
It's a pretty nice view.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Hey.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Hey, Chewie.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Where at?
Right there.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Why don't I see about
fixing us some supper.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000
That'd be great.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Aren't we gonna go
to the town picnic?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I don't feel
up to it.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Troop, I'm sorry.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Maybe you and I
can stop by later.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
That's a good idea.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Go into the kitchen
and help Lydia.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
There's some cold
spaghetti in the fridge.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Okay.
Okay, go help her.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
How much of this
are you taking?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
It's never enough.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
You in a lot of pain?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I can manage.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Thank you for today, Sam.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I owe you so much.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Oh, I don't know about that.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I'd say we're pretty even.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
And I don't just mean
when we were kids.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I mean now, as well.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
You keep showing me
how to live my life.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
You're doing just
fine without me.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
It's different without you.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
You know...

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I never told you this.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
But that night
before you left,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
we were sitting
out on your porch...

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I know.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
What?

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
You were gonna give
me your class ring.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
How did you know that?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I just knew.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000
I didn't want to hurt you.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
You mean so much to me.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I love you, Sam.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
You and Lydia both.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Now, listen.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
On that bookshelf, up...

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
underneath the... basket,

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
there's a letter--
will you get it for me?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Come here.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I want you to give
this to Trooper when
you think he's ready.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I wrote him a letter
about his dad.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I always thought he should have
a dad he could believe in.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
He has one now.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
My gosh.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
What's that?

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Dee Dee, Sam, you've got
to come check this out.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
There she is!

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Hey!

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
We, uh,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
we figured you couldn't make
the picnic, uh, Dee Dee,

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
so, uh, we decided
to bring the picnic to you.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000

(birds call and squawk

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And so, we turn to the Scripture
passages just read

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
and we look to the memory
of Dee Dee Michaud's life

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
for consolation in our sorrow

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
and for inspiration
in our lives.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
And now, Dee Dee's son, Trooper,
has requested a moment.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
When...

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.000
When my mom said
we were gonna move here...

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I didn't really want to...

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
'cause...

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
'cause I didn't really know
anybody then.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
She said...

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
she said that
this town was special,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000
and she told me
lots of stories about it.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
But... she said every place
we lived was special.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
So I didn't really believe her.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
But I liked the stories anyways.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Now...

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Now I see what she meant.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Wherever I go...

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
it reminds me of her.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
It's like...

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000
It's like she's still here.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I'm glad we came.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I'm glad.
