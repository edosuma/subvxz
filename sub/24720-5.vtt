WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:03.438
Previously onElementary...

00:03.481 --> 00:05.005
Hey, uh, my name's Michael.Hello.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.484
A man approached me
at a meeting yesterday.

00:06.528 --> 00:07.877
Apparently, I-I helped him once
when I described

00:07.920 --> 00:12.012
how integral my work was
to maintaining my sobriety.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.536
There's this girl I know
from the program.

00:14.579 --> 00:15.624
I'm worried about her.

00:15.667 --> 00:16.799
You want me to look for her?

00:16.842 --> 00:19.149
I thought it might help you,
too.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.977
HOLMES:
Six weeks ago,
I experienced bouts

00:21.021 --> 00:23.023
of dizziness, memory loss,

00:23.066 --> 00:25.068
sensitivity to noise
and bright lights.

00:25.112 --> 00:28.593
I have something called
post-concussion syndrome.

00:28.637 --> 00:29.899
Things could get worse
before they get better.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.901
[applause]

00:31.944 --> 00:33.990
ANNOUNCER:
Midnight Ranger:
It's Always Midnight

00:34.034 --> 00:35.992
will now take
a 15-minute intermission.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.995
Please be back in your seats
in 15 minutes.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.779
Ira. Ira!

00:40.823 --> 00:42.781
Don't move.

00:42.825 --> 00:46.176
I'm telling you
for the last time,

00:46.220 --> 00:48.744
do something about these wires
or find yourself a new Ranger.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.572
I almost collided
with Dietrich out there.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.095
You're gonna
kill somebody.

00:52.139 --> 00:55.011
Justin, you want
to accuse me of murder,

00:55.055 --> 00:57.405
get in line.
These folks over here

00:57.448 --> 00:59.320
just beat you to it.

00:59.363 --> 01:02.105
Go, go. I'll talk
to you after the show.

01:02.149 --> 01:04.455
A lot of pressure
for a big producer.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.109
A lot of money on the line.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.197
You have no idea.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.112
Actually, we do.
We looked it up.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.940
Your show's budget
is around $30 million.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.985
If you don't turn
a healthy profit,

01:13.029 --> 01:14.030
you're ruined.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.771
A scathing review from a critic

01:15.814 --> 01:18.121
like Victoria Garvey could take
a bite out of your box office.

01:18.165 --> 01:21.690
What? I loved
Victoria, okay?

01:21.733 --> 01:23.344
She was an institution.

01:23.387 --> 01:27.130
She was cranky, but
that was her schtick.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.306
Witnesses overheard the two of
you having a heated conversation

01:29.350 --> 01:31.961
at Sardi's after
Wednesday's matinee.

01:32.004 --> 01:34.790
Didn't sound to us like a talk
with an "institution."

01:34.833 --> 01:37.227
Sounded more like you knew how
her review was gonna go.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.924
WATSON:
You could not afford

01:38.968 --> 01:40.448
to let her rip you
to shreds in print,

01:40.491 --> 01:43.146
so you killed her and then
you burned down her house.

01:43.190 --> 01:47.237
Look... I didn't
kill Victoria.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.500
I didn't have to.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.241
Yeah, you're right,

01:51.285 --> 01:53.678
she told me her review
was gonna be a bloodbath.

01:53.722 --> 01:57.160
But then she offered to bury it
if I made it worth her while.

01:57.204 --> 02:00.163
You're saying she
solicited a bribe?

02:00.207 --> 02:02.644
That's how she operated.

02:02.687 --> 02:05.081
You don't believe
me, ask around.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.170
That "heated
conversation," eh,

02:08.215 --> 02:09.607
that was just us
haggling over the price.

02:09.651 --> 02:12.175
You know admitting
that she was squeezing you

02:12.219 --> 02:14.395
doesn't make you look
less guilty of her murder?

02:14.438 --> 02:16.005
You said it yourself.

02:16.048 --> 02:18.703
My ups and downs are
measured in eight figures.

02:18.747 --> 02:21.184
What's $50 grand
against that?

02:21.228 --> 02:23.360
Besides, I,
uh, wired her

02:23.404 --> 02:25.623
the money the morning
after she was already dead.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.625
I hadn't heard yet.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.671
If I'm the one
who killed her,

02:29.714 --> 02:32.108
why would I do that?

02:34.458 --> 02:36.678
Hey.

02:38.854 --> 02:41.813
I hope your day was less
of a dud than mine.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.685
So, Ira Langstrom
may have single-handedly

02:43.728 --> 02:45.469
murdered
the Broadway musical,

02:45.513 --> 02:47.689
but Marcus and I do not think
that he killed Victoria Garvey.

02:47.732 --> 02:50.387
So that argument that people saw
them having on the street?

02:50.431 --> 02:52.128
He says that they were
negotiating the amount that he

02:52.172 --> 02:54.086
was gonna pay her for writing
nice things about his show.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.306
Apparently, anyone could buy
a good review from her--

02:56.350 --> 02:58.134
and you haven't heard
a word I've said.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.092
Dead critic took bribe.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.833
Have you and I
spoken since lunch?

03:01.877 --> 03:03.357
No, you don't remember?

03:03.400 --> 03:06.577
I've got no memory
of the last six hours.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.580
I'm calling Dr. Hanson.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.495
My head is the less urgent
of our concerns at the moment.

03:11.539 --> 03:15.064
A short while ago, I arrived
home carrying this bag.

03:15.107 --> 03:17.806
And I couldn't recall
what was inside, so...

03:20.112 --> 03:22.202
Well, I looked.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.775
[Watson gasps]

03:30.819 --> 03:33.822
[exhales]

03:33.865 --> 03:36.172
There is a head in there.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.001
Yes, there is.

03:40.263 --> 03:44.049
And I have no idea
where I got it.

03:44.093 --> 03:47.401
â™ª

04:19.302 --> 04:21.216
What's the last thing
you remember?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.088
After you left
to meet Marcus,

04:23.132 --> 04:26.091
I rang the fire marshal assigned
to Ms. Garvey's investigation

04:26.135 --> 04:28.398
to see if he'd
discovered anything

04:28.442 --> 04:30.444
I hadn't already concluded
two days ago.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.663
He had not.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.013
After that, I recall planning
another review

04:35.057 --> 04:37.015
of Ms. Garvey's personal life,

04:37.059 --> 04:39.017
and then...

04:39.061 --> 04:41.629
nothing.

04:41.672 --> 04:44.284
Until the moment I was walking
up our front steps

04:44.327 --> 04:46.677
carrying a head.

04:49.332 --> 04:53.510
So the last thing we know,
you were working the case.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.860
Naturally, I wondered whether
the head might have something

04:55.904 --> 04:58.254
to do with Ms.
Garvey's murder.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.735
But I see no
obvious links.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.737
She had no children,

05:02.780 --> 05:05.696
and that man's facial structure
suggests they are unrelated.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.524
We've seen no evidence

05:07.568 --> 05:09.787
that she had a lover,
male in his 30s

05:09.831 --> 05:11.572
or otherwise.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.443
And no one fitting that
description is missing a head

05:13.487 --> 05:15.184
at the newspaper she wrote for.

05:15.227 --> 05:18.361
I checked
right before you came in.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.450
Okay, well, I'm pretty sure
that you didn't kill him.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.365
Looks like he's been dead
for a while.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.627
And I'm sure you noticed

05:23.671 --> 05:26.021
the same smell I did
when you opened the bag.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.544
Formaldehyde,

05:27.588 --> 05:28.806
glutaraldehyde,

05:28.850 --> 05:30.068
methanol.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.505
Embalming fluid.

05:31.548 --> 05:34.464
So, whoever he is, he was
professionally preserved.

05:34.508 --> 05:37.641
Presumably before his head
was removed.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.252
It could be

05:40.296 --> 05:42.254
I stole it from a funeral parlor

05:42.298 --> 05:44.169
whilst in the throes
of a hallucination.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.650
Or, for all I know, I
found the bag next to me

05:46.694 --> 05:48.217
on the back seat of a taxi.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.523
Possibilities are endless.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.568
I know that you

05:51.612 --> 05:54.441
didn't want to talk to the
captain about your PCS, but I...

05:54.484 --> 05:56.660
You can stop there.
My memory may be a shambles,

05:56.704 --> 05:58.836
but I'm well aware of the
gravity of the situation.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.795
A man's head

06:00.838 --> 06:03.537
is in that bag.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.930
And I don't know
where I got it from,

06:05.974 --> 06:08.672
which means I
also don't know

06:08.716 --> 06:12.284
who might miss it.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.938
I mean, for all we know,

06:13.982 --> 06:15.940
the police are on their way here
as we speak.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.728
I know what I have to do.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.947
[sighs]

06:22.991 --> 06:24.993
[elevator bell dings]

06:26.647 --> 06:28.779
Hey. What are
you doing here?

06:28.823 --> 06:31.739
We need to talk.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.480
Where is the head now?

06:33.523 --> 06:34.959
We notified the M.E.'s office,

06:35.003 --> 06:36.657
and a medicolegal investigator
came to the house.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.399
Watson is accompanying it
to the morgue.

06:39.442 --> 06:42.184
And you have no idea
where you got it.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.186
I do not.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.753
And that's because of this--

06:45.796 --> 06:48.190
what do you call it?Post-concussion syndrome.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.453
Which you've been dealing with
for how long now?

06:50.497 --> 06:52.237
I was diagnosed
just over a month ago.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.718
Well, I didn't tell you

06:54.762 --> 06:56.720
because I didn't
want to concern you.Bull.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.548
You weren't concerned

06:58.592 --> 07:00.898
about me or my feelings.
You were concerned

07:00.942 --> 07:02.813
about yourself.
You didn't tell me

07:02.857 --> 07:05.599
because you were afraid I'd
bench you. And you were right.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.644
Because unlike you,
I've got other people

07:07.688 --> 07:10.691
to worry about. I've got a whole
squad under my command.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.127
I thought we were past all this.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.259
What's that supposed to mean?

07:14.303 --> 07:15.913
Six years ago, when you asked
to work here,

07:15.957 --> 07:18.612
you left out the part about you
just getting out of rehab.

07:18.655 --> 07:21.310
These situations are
completely different.
I know.

07:21.353 --> 07:24.618
But you are not in full control
of your actions right now.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.097
What if you got confused

07:26.141 --> 07:27.838
and you tried to pull
someone's gun?

07:27.882 --> 07:29.361
I get tired.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.885
I get headaches.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.452
I, uh, I... [chuckles]

07:32.495 --> 07:33.888
I've had a brief memory lapse.

07:33.931 --> 07:36.717
During which,
you took a human head

07:36.760 --> 07:39.894
from God knows where and
brought it back to your house.

07:39.937 --> 07:42.157
Look, you and I both know that
even with my new deficiencies,

07:42.200 --> 07:44.464
that I'm still ten times
more capable than...

07:44.507 --> 07:46.683
Oh, go ahead.
Finish your thought.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.120
It's not like it's any secret,
you think you're better

07:49.164 --> 07:50.644
than everyone else.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.733
And the truth is,
too many times,

07:52.776 --> 07:54.735
I have treated you like you are.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.737
So some of this is my fault.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.303
But I'm done.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.480
Cops get injured
on the job all the time.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.177
Cops get concussions
all the time.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.048
You know what they do?
They tell their C.O.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.050
And they get cleared
by a department doctor

08:06.094 --> 08:07.791
before returning to duty.

08:07.835 --> 08:10.751
I am tired of
giving you a pass.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.927
This time,
you want to keep working here,

08:12.970 --> 08:16.017
you're gonna jump through the
same hoops as the rest of us.

08:22.327 --> 08:23.851
How'd it go
with the captain?

08:23.894 --> 08:25.809
[sighs]
About as well as
can be expected.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.463
Hmm. That bad?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.291
I'm to report

08:29.334 --> 08:31.815
to the NYPD's medical division
first thing in the morning.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.817
I'm forbidden for
working with the police

08:33.861 --> 08:36.037
in any capacity until I'm
cleared by a department doctor.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.605
And what if they don't
clear you?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.171
Well, I hear Cape Town's
awash with murder.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.957
I have contacts there.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.263
How did it go at the morgue?
Did Eugene find anything

08:45.307 --> 08:46.830
that might help us
identify our John Doe?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.876
Not yet.
And there's a good chance

08:48.919 --> 08:51.661
that the embalming chemicals
destroyed any DNA.

08:51.705 --> 08:52.836
And dental X-rays
are useless

08:52.880 --> 08:54.316
until they have
someone's records

08:54.359 --> 08:55.752
to compare them to.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.319
Marcus is gonna reach out
to Missing Persons.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.451
Eugene did say that he thought
the head was cut off

08:59.495 --> 09:00.975
with a Satterlee bone saw.

09:01.018 --> 09:03.891
As used by morticians and M.E.s.

09:03.934 --> 09:07.155
And that the man's corneas
were surgically removed.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.591
Suggesting that
prior to embalming,

09:08.635 --> 09:10.506
our John Doe was a tissue
and organ donor.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.552
Which got me thinking,
Victoria Garvey was

09:12.595 --> 09:14.728
in a car accident two weeks ago,
remember?

09:14.771 --> 09:17.121
I lost six hours, not six days.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.167
Yes, it happened in the
Hamptons. Her car hit a tree,

09:19.210 --> 09:21.952
burst into flames,
and her leg was burned.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.737
Bad enough that she needed
a skin graft.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.130
Skin from a human donor.

09:26.174 --> 09:29.525
So our mystery head came from
a tissue donor, and our victim

09:29.569 --> 09:30.918
was a tissue recipient.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.920
Yeah, so it's possible
that the skin graft came

09:32.963 --> 09:34.617
from our John Doe.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.098
That wouldn't explain
why I had the head,

09:37.141 --> 09:39.187
or what it had to do with Ms.
Garvey's murder, if anything.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.755
Well, I was just looking up
the surgical center

09:41.798 --> 09:43.365
where the skin graft
was performed.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.801
Marcus is gonna meet me there
in the morning.

09:44.845 --> 09:45.976
They should have a record

09:46.020 --> 09:47.543
of where the donor tissue
came from.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.979
It could, at
the very least,

09:49.023 --> 09:50.590
help us determine
who John Doe was.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.592
And maybe that'll tell us more.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.991
Morning.
Hey.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.951
Is your partner not here because
he's running down another lead?

10:03.994 --> 10:06.344
Or is he actually taking
his benching seriously?

10:06.388 --> 10:08.651
Oh, the captain told you?

10:08.695 --> 10:10.261
Sherlock went
to the doctor.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.220
He gonna be okay?

10:12.263 --> 10:14.744
You know, brains
are funny things.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.441
The captain, well,
he's the captain.

10:16.485 --> 10:17.965
He's got to look
at the big picture,

10:18.008 --> 10:21.011
but if you guys need anything
from me, just say the word.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.622
Thanks.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.627
Someone else was
in here yesterday,

10:27.670 --> 10:29.150
asking about
the same patient.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.368
Interesting.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.849
British guy?
Short on social skills?

10:32.893 --> 10:34.024
Mr. Holmes.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.418
He said he worked
with the police,

10:36.461 --> 10:37.941
but his social
skills were fine.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.682
BELL:
You caught him
on a good day.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.249
He asked to see
Ms. Garvey's files.

10:41.292 --> 10:42.903
Did you show him?

10:44.469 --> 10:46.428
I wasn't supposed to.

10:46.471 --> 10:49.039
But I couldn't believe it when
he told me she was murdered.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.912
Such a nice lady.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.871
I told Mr. Holmes I wanted
to help, any way I could.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.264
So you
wouldn't mind

10:56.307 --> 10:57.744
showing us as well?

10:58.919 --> 11:01.486
At first, your friend
was wondering

11:01.530 --> 11:03.010
how the surgery went.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.489
Were there any complications,

11:04.533 --> 11:06.883
how did her surgeon seem
after it was over?

11:06.927 --> 11:09.059
Was he wondering if there was
some sort of malpractice?

11:09.103 --> 11:11.409
He thought
maybe Ms. Garvey

11:11.453 --> 11:12.933
was killed
to cover it up.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.717
But I told him
that was crazy.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.588
Dr. Chopra is one of
the sweetest people

11:16.632 --> 11:17.938
I've ever met.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.983
Plus, she was
visiting family in India

11:20.027 --> 11:21.550
when Ms. Garvey died.

11:21.593 --> 11:24.901
So your friend
lost interest in that.

11:24.945 --> 11:27.730
And then something
in Ms. Garvey's

11:27.774 --> 11:29.906
donation documents
caught his eye.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.735
He started asking questions
about them instead.

11:32.779 --> 11:33.910
Donation documents?

11:33.954 --> 11:35.825
Donor tissue
always comes with paperwork--

11:35.869 --> 11:37.131
vital stats about the donor

11:37.174 --> 11:38.828
and information
about preparation and use.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.744
Just so I'm clear,
when we say "donor,"

11:41.788 --> 11:43.006
we're talking about
cadavers, right?

11:43.050 --> 11:45.356
People who agreed to donate

11:45.400 --> 11:48.055
their organs and tissues
after they died.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.621
The donor
for Victoria's skin

11:49.665 --> 11:52.320
was a white male, age 32.
That matches

11:52.363 --> 11:53.974
our John Doe.

11:54.017 --> 11:56.367
But no donor name.
Just a number?

11:56.411 --> 11:57.368
It's anonymous when we get it.

11:57.412 --> 11:58.761
But the tissue bank

11:58.805 --> 12:00.371
that sold us the skin

12:00.415 --> 12:01.764
should have
the donor's name

12:01.808 --> 12:03.723
in their records.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.334
Do you know what it was
that interested Mr. Holmes?

12:06.377 --> 12:08.292
He didn't say.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.731
He did ask if we had any other
forms from the same tissue bank.

12:11.774 --> 12:14.908
I came in here to pull some,

12:14.951 --> 12:16.823
and when I went back out

12:16.866 --> 12:19.826
to the waiting room,
he was gone.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.871
Yeah, he does that.

12:28.356 --> 12:32.055
I think I know what it was
that Sherlock saw.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.709
So, these forms
document

12:33.753 --> 12:35.450
all of the testing for diseases

12:35.493 --> 12:37.844
that the tissue bank
performs on each donor.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.107
But these are all identical.
They were not

12:40.150 --> 12:43.110
filled out separately. They're
all copies of the same form.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.502
You see
the ink flecks

12:44.546 --> 12:46.504
and the image degradation?

12:46.548 --> 12:48.942
That's from
repeated photocopying.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.988
Someone at the tissue bank's
been rubber-stamping their work.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.819
This one has the same

12:56.863 --> 12:59.082
donor number as Victoria's.

12:59.126 --> 13:02.999
So, Kareem Ludlow...

13:03.043 --> 13:05.785
got tissue from
the same body?

13:05.828 --> 13:07.612
I had that file out already,

13:07.656 --> 13:09.832
because the patient
missed a follow-up.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.965
He was scheduled to have the
cadaver skin removed yesterday

13:12.008 --> 13:15.359
and get a permanent autograft
in its place.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.709
Well, that's a pretty big
appointment to miss.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.059
Were you able to reach him?

13:19.102 --> 13:21.235
He didn't return my calls.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.846
Kareem Ludlow,
same home address,

13:23.890 --> 13:25.195
was killed in a fire

13:25.239 --> 13:26.718
in Hoboken
on Monday.

13:26.762 --> 13:29.417
Fire marshal ruled
it suspicious.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.636
That's two days before
Victoria Garvey died.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.814
So two people got skin grafts
from the same donor

13:34.857 --> 13:36.424
and they were both
killed in fires.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.513
Whoever our John Doe was,

13:38.556 --> 13:41.037
someone wanted every
last bit of him dead.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.829
BELL:
Both of those patients
received skin grafts

13:49.872 --> 13:52.179
from the same cadaver, which
came from your tissue bank.

13:52.222 --> 13:55.617
Earlier this week both
those patients were murdered.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.053
And you think I had
something to do with that.

13:57.097 --> 14:00.100
I'm not in the business
of taking lives, Detective.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.058
I'm in the business
of saving them.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.539
Operating a human chop shop

14:04.582 --> 14:06.715
has made you very rich,
Mr. Voth.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.849
Your company pulled in
close to $10 million last year,

14:09.892 --> 14:12.242
so how about you drop
the phony altruism?

14:12.286 --> 14:14.157
Those forms strongly
suggest that your company

14:14.201 --> 14:15.376
has been cutting corners

14:15.419 --> 14:17.987
on disinfection and
disease testing,

14:18.031 --> 14:20.120
in blatant violation
of FDA regulations.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.904
We think you realized

14:21.948 --> 14:24.211
that a contamination got through
involving the cadaver

14:24.254 --> 14:26.735
those two people
received tissue from.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.172
Now, if they'd gotten sick
and it got traced back to you,

14:29.216 --> 14:31.958
you would have been hit
with lawsuits, criminal charges.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.220
It would've shut you down.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.353
I swear, it's like dÃ©jÃ  vu.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.660
How's that?

14:38.703 --> 14:40.314
Another guy was
in here yesterday

14:40.357 --> 14:42.098
peddling the same garbage.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.320
A friend of yours?

14:46.363 --> 14:48.452
Because he broke
into my facility

14:48.496 --> 14:51.194
after we talked
and stole one of my products.

14:51.238 --> 14:52.326
The way I see it,

14:52.369 --> 14:53.805
you're the ones
who should be worried

14:53.849 --> 14:55.111
about criminal charges.

14:55.155 --> 14:58.375
This product you say he stole

14:58.419 --> 15:01.030
wouldn't happen to be
a severed head, would it?

15:01.074 --> 15:04.033
So you do know him.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.730
Did you call the police?

15:05.774 --> 15:07.515
Guess you didn't
want us taking

15:07.558 --> 15:09.952
too close a look around.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.520
Mr. Voth, if you had nothing
to do with the murders,

15:12.563 --> 15:13.782
why not cooperate?

15:13.825 --> 15:15.697
Give us access
to your facility

15:15.740 --> 15:17.438
and your records and the names

15:17.481 --> 15:20.789
of anyone else who received
tissue from that donor.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.313
Show us this wasn't you.

15:23.357 --> 15:25.011
If you want my cooperation...

15:26.316 --> 15:27.535
...come back with a warrant.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.161
What are you doing?

15:45.205 --> 15:46.815
I'm running.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.599
Have you also suffered
a concussion?

15:48.643 --> 15:51.733
I meant, why are you trying
to break the land speed record?

15:51.776 --> 15:53.561
It was your research
that informed me of the link

15:53.604 --> 15:55.693
between increased
physical activity

15:55.737 --> 15:57.608
and quicker recovery from PCS.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.133
I remember. I also remember
that the study recommended

16:00.176 --> 16:02.309
moderate exercise.

16:02.352 --> 16:05.312
Not trying to
outrun Usain Bolt.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.663
[beeps]

16:08.706 --> 16:10.273
[exhales]

16:12.841 --> 16:15.365
[treadmill slowing]Better?

16:15.409 --> 16:18.194
Much. Also, now we can talk.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.891
I appreciate your texts,

16:19.935 --> 16:21.328
keeping me apprised of your
progress with Marcus.

16:21.371 --> 16:22.938
At least now I can pretend

16:22.982 --> 16:25.332
I'm a contributing member
of this investigation.

16:25.375 --> 16:28.726
Are you kidding? So far,
you'd been everywhere we went.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.293
All we did today
was catch up.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.166
On the bright side,
now that we know where

16:33.209 --> 16:37.213
I acquired John Doe's head,
we might also know why.

16:37.257 --> 16:39.389
It stands to reason I took it
to deny Dominic Voth

16:39.433 --> 16:41.478
the chance to destroy evidence

16:41.522 --> 16:44.438
and preserve our opportunity
to identify the donor.

16:44.481 --> 16:47.354
Unfortunately, he's gonna be
a John Doe a bit longer.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.877
Marcus heard back
from Missing Persons,

16:48.920 --> 16:51.401
and the head is not a match
for any reported cases.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.360
I mean, that doesn't change the
fact that we think that Voth,

16:53.403 --> 16:56.102
or someone from his company,
killed two people.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.321
You're hoping
that if you can prove

16:58.365 --> 17:00.497
John Doe's tissue
was compromised,

17:00.541 --> 17:02.325
it'll help the police get
a search warrant

17:02.369 --> 17:03.413
for the tissue bank.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.807
I'm guessing the head
will be no help

17:05.849 --> 17:08.069
in that regard,
given that the whole point

17:08.114 --> 17:10.203
of embalming chemicals
is disinfection.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.161
Yeah, and since
we haven't heard anything

17:12.204 --> 17:14.119
about Victoria Garvey being
sick, we're gonna focus on

17:14.163 --> 17:17.210
the other tissue recipient,
Kareem Ludlow.

17:17.252 --> 17:20.300
Marcus is gonna reach out
to his family in the morning.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.519
[exhales]
If you'll excuse me,

17:22.563 --> 17:25.392
my recovering brain
needs hydration.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.789
You still haven't told me
how your day went.

17:31.833 --> 17:36.316
Oh. By and large,
unmitigated boredom.

17:36.359 --> 17:39.275
But I do remember every second
of it, so that's an improvement.

17:39.319 --> 17:42.365
I used some of my time
to read up on

17:42.409 --> 17:44.411
the "tissue industrial complex"

17:44.454 --> 17:46.065
and the myriad ways

17:46.108 --> 17:47.240
that a human body
can be monetized

17:47.283 --> 17:50.069
once broken down into parts.

17:50.112 --> 17:54.464
Including how a preserved head
can be sold to educate dentists

17:54.508 --> 17:57.250
on the latest advances
in titanium implants.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.034
Well, that would
explain why

17:59.078 --> 18:01.254
the tissue bank had John Doe's
head in their inventory,

18:01.297 --> 18:04.257
but I was asking about your trip
to the medical division.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.562
Well, there isn't much
to tell.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.390
The police doctor had me perform

18:07.434 --> 18:08.913
a battery of
neurological tests--

18:08.957 --> 18:10.785
standing on one leg,
reciting the alphabet.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.352
I offered to juggle

18:12.395 --> 18:13.788
whilst riding a unicycle,

18:13.831 --> 18:15.920
but she had other patients
to see.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.140
She's going to confer
with my doctor

18:18.184 --> 18:22.405
and then issue a ruling,
so I await my fate.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.451
You're not gonna do
any more running, are you?

18:24.494 --> 18:27.193
What if I am?

18:27.236 --> 18:29.369
I know that you want to get back
to work for the department

18:29.412 --> 18:30.544
as quickly as possible,

18:30.587 --> 18:32.415
but pushing yourself
too hard

18:32.459 --> 18:33.373
isn't gonna make it go
any faster.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.765
You can't get well in one day.

18:34.809 --> 18:38.334
[doorbell rings]

18:38.378 --> 18:40.206
Are you expecting anyone?

18:47.865 --> 18:50.129
Hey, you do live here.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.000
I do. What are you
doing here?

18:52.043 --> 18:53.306
Uh, sorry, I didn't mean
to freak you out.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.177
Can I come in?

18:55.221 --> 18:57.397
Yeah.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.539
Yeah, I had a rough sense
of where you lived

19:09.583 --> 19:11.237
because of the meetings
you went to.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.934
I knew I was gonna be
in the neighborhood tonight,

19:12.977 --> 19:16.459
so I looked you up.I'm not listed.

19:16.503 --> 19:19.419
Yeah, but you know I-I work
at an architecture firm.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.508
So we look up building records
all the time,

19:21.551 --> 19:23.553
and I saw this was listed
to a Morland Holmes

19:23.597 --> 19:24.859
and took a shot.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.254
I get you at a bad time?

19:28.297 --> 19:32.345
Well, I... Sorry,
it-it's been a weird day.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.085
Do you want to talk about it?

19:34.129 --> 19:37.219
No, I-I'm-I'm really
all talked out.

19:37.263 --> 19:41.223
Well, look, I'm gonna go to
the meeting at St. Augustine's

19:41.267 --> 19:42.442
if you change your mind.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.618
Are you working a case
right now?

19:44.661 --> 19:45.923
Why do you ask?

19:45.967 --> 19:47.447
I know it's good for you.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.188
It keeps you focused.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.668
Michael, I appreciate you
taking an interest in me,

19:51.712 --> 19:54.584
but I-I think you misunderstand
my relationship with my work.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.282
It doesn't keep me sober.

19:56.325 --> 20:00.155
My commitment to the program
keeps me sober, to the steps.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.461
Right, but you...

20:01.504 --> 20:03.202
Well, there's no buts.
That's it.

20:03.245 --> 20:06.857
Oh. Um, before I go,
have you heard anything...

20:06.901 --> 20:08.598
There have been no new leads
in the disappearance

20:08.642 --> 20:10.644
of Polly Kenner.

20:10.687 --> 20:14.474
And I've uncovered no indication
that she met with foul play.

20:14.517 --> 20:15.649
She's been missing
for weeks now.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.433
I know. That concerns me.

20:17.477 --> 20:20.523
But she has an unfortunate
history of dropping off the map.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.525
I've lodged inquiries
with the law enforcement

20:22.569 --> 20:24.919
where she is most
likely to turn up,

20:24.962 --> 20:27.530
but... all we
can do is wait.

20:27.574 --> 20:31.665
Well, thanks for your help.

20:31.708 --> 20:34.320
Sorry to bother you.

20:37.018 --> 20:39.803
[door opens]

20:39.847 --> 20:41.501
[door closes]

20:41.544 --> 20:43.590
You had a question
about a culture we handled?

20:43.633 --> 20:46.897
We're investigating the murder
of a man named Kareem Ludlow.

20:46.941 --> 20:49.335
His doctor told us he had
developed flu-like symptoms

20:49.378 --> 20:51.206
after undergoing surgery,

20:51.250 --> 20:53.556
and the doctor sent a culture
here for analysis.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.777
Long story, but the results
could be pertinent to the case.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.214
I remember this.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.912
I'm happy to print you
the results, but I have a hunch

21:01.956 --> 21:03.566
it's not going
to be much use.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.438
This culture was corrupted
here at the lab.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.614
Corrupted how?

21:07.657 --> 21:09.529
It tested positive for H7N5.

21:09.572 --> 21:12.227
That's a type of bird flu.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.620
An incredibly rare one.

21:13.663 --> 21:15.448
There was no way Mr. Ludlow
could have caught it,

21:15.491 --> 21:17.624
so we chalked it up
to cross-contamination.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.844
H7N5 is only found
in one province in China.

21:20.888 --> 21:23.282
And when our investigator
followed up with Mr. Ludlow,

21:23.325 --> 21:25.458
he said he'd never even
been out of the country.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.155
You said you thought
there was cross-contamination.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.678
That means you have some sample

21:28.722 --> 21:30.289
of the virus in your lab.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.682
I remember reading about
a bird flu case in New York

21:32.726 --> 21:33.901
about a month ago.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.337
BELL:
Thing is, we don't think

21:35.381 --> 21:36.817
Mr. Ludlow got sick traveling.

21:36.860 --> 21:39.515
We think he got sick
from a tissue donation.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.909
We knew about Mr. Ludlow's
surgery, and we considered that,

21:41.952 --> 21:43.345
but it didn't track.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.478
The case you're talking about

21:45.521 --> 21:48.829
involved three Chinese women

21:48.872 --> 21:52.746
who'd visited family
outside Shanghai six weeks ago.

21:52.789 --> 21:56.576
A mother and daughter
and the mother's first cousin.

21:56.619 --> 21:59.709
Soon after they had reentered
the U.S., they were hospitalized

21:59.753 --> 22:01.537
and tested positive for H7N5.

22:01.581 --> 22:04.932
All three died
within two weeks.

22:04.975 --> 22:07.151
They definitely
were not tissue donors.

22:07.195 --> 22:10.372
We're pretty sure our donor
was a white male anyway.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.547
WATSON:
And these women-- you're sure

22:11.591 --> 22:13.027
they never infected
anyone else?

22:13.070 --> 22:15.638
Our team traced everyone
they came into contact with.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.553
No one else
was contaminated.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.903
They never crossed paths
with Kareem Ludlow.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.214
You wanted to show me something?

22:26.257 --> 22:27.998
BELL:
Yeah. I've been looking

22:28.042 --> 22:30.610
into the women
that died from bird flu.

22:30.653 --> 22:33.395
The doc that Joan and I talked
to at the Department of Health

22:33.439 --> 22:35.310
was positive
they didn't give it to anyone.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.877
But you think she might
have missed something.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.445
I was thinking
our tissue donor's a white guy.

22:39.488 --> 22:42.404
The three victims were from
a traditional Chinese family.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.624
If the young one
was dating our guy,

22:44.667 --> 22:46.626
she might have wanted
to keep it a secret.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.323
Her name is Wu Meili.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.064
I found this
on her social media.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.675
She was taking an ESL class
at the time.

22:52.719 --> 22:56.418
Check out the numbers
under the teacher's name.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.420
"520, 530."

22:58.464 --> 23:00.422
Mean anything?They're SMS codes,

23:00.466 --> 23:02.685
only popular
with young Chinese people,

23:02.729 --> 23:06.385
so it's unlikely Meili's parents
would have understood them.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.996
They mean "I love you"
and "I miss you."

23:09.039 --> 23:10.519
Do you think Meili
and her teacher

23:10.563 --> 23:12.695
had a secret thing going?

23:12.739 --> 23:15.568
This is a picture
of the teacher,

23:15.611 --> 23:18.571
guy named Eric Russo.
You tell me.

23:18.614 --> 23:21.400
Same guy.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.706
So our tissue
donor has a name.

23:23.750 --> 23:26.187
And if he was intimate
with Meili

23:26.230 --> 23:28.102
after she got back
to the States,

23:28.145 --> 23:29.582
he'd have
the bird flu, too.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.801
So this all backs the
theory you and Joan

23:31.845 --> 23:34.195
came up with, right?
That the two tissue

23:34.238 --> 23:36.458
recipients got
contaminated skin,

23:36.502 --> 23:38.808
and someone from the
tissue bank killed them.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.506
This proves motive.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.812
Then let's get a warrant.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.470
WOMAN:
In light of recent
developments,

23:48.514 --> 23:50.124
Mr. Voth is willing to concede

23:50.167 --> 23:52.126
that Voth Biologics
cut some corners

23:52.169 --> 23:54.911
in the processing
of a handful of tissues.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.391
That's real
big of him,

23:56.435 --> 23:58.480
admitting things
we can already prove.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.743
But right now we care less
about the regulations

24:00.787 --> 24:04.747
he broke than we do about
the two murders he committed

24:04.791 --> 24:06.096
to cover it up.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.707
WATSON:
The Department of Health

24:07.750 --> 24:09.273
briefly suspected that tissue

24:09.317 --> 24:11.101
from your facility
infected a patient

24:11.145 --> 24:14.496
with H7N5, and they
notified you at the time.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.629
They later believed
that it was an error,

24:16.672 --> 24:18.282
but the truth is,
they were right.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.849
GREGSON:
The patient's name was

24:19.893 --> 24:21.460
Kareem Ludlow.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.505
Not long after,

24:23.549 --> 24:25.681
he and another recipient
from the same donor,

24:25.725 --> 24:27.640
Victoria Garvey,

24:27.683 --> 24:31.513
were both murdered, and their
bodies were destroyed in fires.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.733
WATSON:
We think that you set
those fires so that

24:33.776 --> 24:36.039
no one would find out
how they had gotten sick.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.825
I'm sorry.
Are you seriously suggesting

24:38.868 --> 24:41.305
my client committed
two murders over

24:41.349 --> 24:42.829
a call about
a possible contamination?

24:42.872 --> 24:44.526
GREGSON:
No.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.267
We're suggesting
he did the murders

24:46.310 --> 24:48.965
after he confirmed
the contamination.

24:49.009 --> 24:52.099
He had Eric Russo's body
at his facility.

24:52.142 --> 24:55.885
And seeing as he sold
tissue from it before

24:55.929 --> 25:00.107
it was embalmed, we can assume
that he did the embalming.

25:00.150 --> 25:03.066
You got the call
from D.O.H.,

25:03.110 --> 25:05.808
you tested Russo's body,
you found out

25:05.852 --> 25:08.376
it was indeed infected
with bird flu,

25:08.419 --> 25:10.073
and you knew
that could ruin you.

25:10.117 --> 25:13.468
So you embalmed him to
destroy the evidence,

25:13.512 --> 25:16.471
and you killed the two people
who received his tissue.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.605
Mr. Voth's company routinely
embalms cadavers.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.650
It's hardly proof of a cover-up.

25:21.694 --> 25:23.304
You are right
about the embalming.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.871
But you're wrong
about the rest.

25:24.914 --> 25:29.876
And if you look at the records
you seized, they'll prove it.

25:31.355 --> 25:35.838
I didn't test that body
after the D.O.H. called.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.710
I didn't want to know
if they were right.

25:37.753 --> 25:42.062
And I sure as hell didn't want
a paper trail showing I knew.

25:42.105 --> 25:45.848
So I had the body embalmed
right away.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.676
These are the only two people

25:47.720 --> 25:50.505
who received tissue
from that donor.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.289
We took the rest
of the tissues

25:52.333 --> 25:55.510
out of inventory
and burned them.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.687
You realize you just confessed
to tampering with evidence?

25:58.731 --> 26:01.429
He did, but I think
his larger point is that,

26:01.472 --> 26:04.519
with the evidence destroyed,
he didn't have to kill anybody.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.217
I did a lot
of bad things, but I'm

26:07.261 --> 26:08.828
no murderer.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.830
Speak to you a sec?

26:12.658 --> 26:15.791
Excuse us.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.928
So, even if Voth's
records don't show it,

26:21.971 --> 26:23.190
he could have tested the tissue.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.626
He could still be our killer.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.541
Actually, I think
the opposite's true.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.325
If Voth did test
Eric Russo's tissue,

26:28.369 --> 26:29.936
he almost definitely
isn't the killer.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.807
I just got off the phone
with Eric's brother.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.375
Poor guy had no
idea Eric was dead.

26:34.418 --> 26:35.985
He told me that
Eric lived alone

26:36.029 --> 26:38.988
and wasn't teaching
any classes this month.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.034
Explains why no one
reported him missing.

26:41.077 --> 26:42.775
Thing is, the last time

26:42.818 --> 26:44.777
the brother saw Eric
was two days before

26:44.820 --> 26:46.779
his body arrived
at the tissue bank.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.215
They went for drinks.

26:48.258 --> 26:50.609
Eric mentioned that a student
he was dating had died.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.133
So you were right
about Wu Meili.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.831
But the brother said
that when he saw Eric,

26:55.875 --> 26:57.659
Eric didn't seem sick.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.488
So I did a little digging
and called a CrossFit gym

27:00.531 --> 27:01.968
where Eric was a member.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.447
The manager checked
the computers.

27:03.491 --> 27:06.537
Eric took a class there
the same day he saw his brother.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.670
That doesn't make any sense.
By that point in his infection,

27:08.714 --> 27:11.020
Eric should have had pneumonia,
even kidney failure.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.369
He should've been
too sick to walk,

27:12.413 --> 27:13.893
let alone do CrossFit.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.677
You said his girlfriend
was already dead.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.461
So when did Eric catch the flu?

27:17.505 --> 27:18.941
That's just the thing.
If he wasn't showing

27:18.985 --> 27:21.248
any symptoms, then Eric
never had the flu at all.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.293
And if Voth had
tested Eric's tissue,

27:23.337 --> 27:25.252
he would have known that.

27:25.295 --> 27:27.558
Meaning he wouldn't have had any
motive to commit the murders.

27:27.602 --> 27:30.823
So our theory of the crime
is wrong.

27:30.866 --> 27:33.303
We're back to square one.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.493
Are we having a barbecue?

27:49.537 --> 27:52.932
So, now, more than ever,
given my diminished state,

27:52.975 --> 27:57.371
I find visual aids useful in
holding onto complex thoughts.

27:57.414 --> 27:59.068
So I put together a flowchart

27:59.112 --> 28:00.679
of all the deceased
individuals

28:00.722 --> 28:02.724
involved in the case.

28:02.768 --> 28:06.336
And that explains
the chicken decals how?

28:06.380 --> 28:08.730
We're faced with a paradox,
and it needs resolving.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.123
According to the Department
of Health,

28:10.166 --> 28:11.733
Wu Meili and her family

28:11.777 --> 28:13.300
contracted bird flu
whilst visiting

28:13.343 --> 28:15.302
a Shanghainese poultry farm,

28:15.345 --> 28:18.348
so these seemed
a fitting indicator

28:18.392 --> 28:19.828
of bird flu status.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.351
And, as an added bonus,

28:21.395 --> 28:23.266
we have dinner
for a couple of weeks.

28:23.310 --> 28:27.270
Because all this really puts me
in the mood to eat chicken.

28:27.314 --> 28:31.013
Well, beginning where it began,

28:31.057 --> 28:33.363
the Chinese ladies,

28:33.407 --> 28:38.020
they all had bird flu,
so they all get a sticker.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.198
Over here,

28:42.242 --> 28:44.766
we have our two murder victims,

28:44.810 --> 28:47.160
Kareem Ludlow, Victoria Garvey.

28:47.203 --> 28:48.465
Now, he received
donor tissue

28:48.509 --> 28:51.033
from her boyfriend.

28:51.077 --> 28:52.600
He then showed
symptoms himself

28:52.643 --> 28:55.951
and he tested positive.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.780
The D.O.H. said that that test
was contaminated.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.564
That's an unlikely coincidence
to my mind.

29:00.608 --> 29:01.783
Especially since
they reported

29:01.827 --> 29:03.219
no other contaminations.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.830
So, bird flu.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.266
Victoria Garvey, we don't know.

29:06.309 --> 29:07.920
This brings us

29:07.963 --> 29:11.271
to the man at the center
of it all, Eric Russo,

29:11.314 --> 29:13.273
our tissue donor,

29:13.316 --> 29:14.883
and for a brief time,

29:14.927 --> 29:16.667
our travel-sized
house guest.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.408
Now,
on the one hand,

29:18.452 --> 29:19.540
our case only really makes sense

29:19.583 --> 29:21.411
if Eric had the bird flu.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.283
It's the only reasonable
explanation

29:23.326 --> 29:25.111
for Kareem's positive test,

29:25.154 --> 29:27.287
and it would provide us
theory of motive

29:27.330 --> 29:28.505
for both of these murders.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.551
On the other hand,
multiple witnesses said

29:30.594 --> 29:32.335
that Eric was asymptomatic

29:32.379 --> 29:34.294
at a time where he should've
been close to death.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.775
Is there any way that
he could have infected people

29:36.818 --> 29:38.907
whilst not showing
symptoms himself?

29:38.951 --> 29:40.735
He would have had
to have been immune.

29:40.779 --> 29:41.997
But that would be impossible.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.825
This flu
is a hundred percent fatal.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.480
Hence our paradox.
By the dictates of logic,

29:46.523 --> 29:50.789
Eric simultaneously must have
had the bird flu and not had it.

29:52.181 --> 29:53.661
It's Schrodinger's bird flu.

29:56.142 --> 29:59.493
How long has that chicken
been out of the fridge?

30:01.147 --> 30:02.322
WATSON:
So, Marcus called earlier.

30:02.365 --> 30:03.453
The police are going
through the records

30:03.497 --> 30:04.977
they seized from
the tissue bank.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.893
CCS found e-mails
between Voth and his execs.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.329
They were planning to pin

30:09.372 --> 30:12.332
all of the testing shortcuts
on one lab tech

30:12.375 --> 30:13.550
in case it ever came out.

30:13.594 --> 30:17.380
Well, that would
support Voth's innocence.

30:17.424 --> 30:19.513
It seems unlikely
he would set up a scapegoat

30:19.556 --> 30:22.908
when he was committing two
murders to cover his misdeeds.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.040
But Voth's records
also mentioned

30:25.084 --> 30:28.000
that they had bought Eric's body
from a body broker.

30:28.043 --> 30:31.438
Another unsavory player in the
supply chain of Big Tissue.

30:31.481 --> 30:35.529
Someone who procures dead bodies
from hospitals and hospices

30:35.572 --> 30:37.618
and sells them to tissue banks.

30:37.661 --> 30:40.664
Right, but this broker
also forged

30:40.708 --> 30:42.623
Eric's donor consent forms,

30:42.666 --> 30:44.364
so he was obviously up
to something shady, too.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.583
I mean, it's possible he heard

30:46.627 --> 30:48.150
about the contaminated tissue,

30:48.194 --> 30:49.804
and then committed the murders
to protect

30:49.848 --> 30:51.762
his own racket.So our theory of the crime

30:51.806 --> 30:54.983
could be right, but we would
have the wrong suspect.

30:55.027 --> 30:57.290
The captain is gonna have him
brought down for questioning.

30:57.333 --> 31:00.597
Have the two of you talked
since yesterday?

31:00.641 --> 31:01.772
We have not.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.513
Well, maybe you should.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.080
There's a bush outside.
Perhaps you'd physically like

31:05.124 --> 31:06.255
to beat around it?

31:06.299 --> 31:07.866
I think you should apologize.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.302
You did keep something from him.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.607
A medical condition.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.522
A very private
medical condition,

31:12.566 --> 31:14.263
which, I would remind you,

31:14.307 --> 31:17.353
has not affected the work
I've done for him one iota.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.486
I get all that.
Okay, I'm not saying

31:19.529 --> 31:21.270
that you should've told him
because he is your boss.

31:21.314 --> 31:22.402
I'm saying that
you should have told him

31:22.445 --> 31:23.751
because he is your friend.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.494
Just think about it.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.977
GREGSON: We called around
to a few of the tissue banks

31:32.020 --> 31:33.717
you supply, Mr. Petty.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.632
Turns out you've been
selling a lot of bodies

31:35.676 --> 31:38.418
with phony papers.

31:38.461 --> 31:42.161
Our guys are combing through
your place right now.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.772
How many missing persons
are we gonna find in there?

31:44.815 --> 31:48.558
Wait, you think
I killed those people?

31:48.602 --> 31:50.952
Crossed our mind that you
might've killed some of them.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.999
But we also think
you might've killed

31:54.042 --> 31:56.653
two other people
to cover it up.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.525
BELL:
According to Dominic Voth,

31:58.568 --> 32:00.005
he called you
when he thought

32:00.048 --> 32:02.703
you'd sold his tissue bank
an infected cadaver.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.183
Guess he thought if
he complained about it,

32:04.226 --> 32:05.575
you'd give him
his money back.

32:05.619 --> 32:08.056
You knew if enough people
started asking questions,

32:08.100 --> 32:10.406
eventually
they'd look at you.

32:10.450 --> 32:11.625
So you killed
the two patients

32:11.668 --> 32:13.540
who received
the dead man's tissue.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.063
You-You've got me all wrong.

32:15.107 --> 32:16.630
I'm not a killer.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.545
I'm just a grave robber.

32:18.588 --> 32:21.026
I don't mean
that literally,

32:21.069 --> 32:23.071
but it's what everyone
I know calls me.

32:23.115 --> 32:25.726
I've got backdoor deals
with a bunch of funeral homes

32:25.769 --> 32:27.597
and crematoriums
around the city.

32:27.641 --> 32:30.252
They slip me bodies
no one's gonna miss;

32:30.296 --> 32:31.601
I slip them a little cash

32:31.645 --> 32:33.647
and then I forge
the consent forms.

32:33.690 --> 32:36.650
It's the only way I can
keep up with demand.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.478
People have all
these hang-ups

32:38.521 --> 32:40.523
about donating their
bodies these days.

32:40.567 --> 32:43.570
Gee. I wonder why.

32:43.613 --> 32:46.094
The two people you
were talking about,

32:46.138 --> 32:48.096
when were they murdered?

32:48.140 --> 32:49.706
BELL:
One was on Wednesday night.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.361
The other was
two nights before that.

32:52.405 --> 32:55.886
I was in Cancun
with a lady friend.

32:55.930 --> 32:57.845
We flew back on Thursday.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.717
BELL:
We'll need your friend's

33:00.761 --> 33:02.545
name and number.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.460
Yeah.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.549
And assuming what
you said checks out,

33:06.593 --> 33:09.726
we'll still need to find out
how Eric Russo ended up dead,

33:09.770 --> 33:11.598
so also write down
the name of the place

33:11.641 --> 33:12.642
where you got his body.

33:12.686 --> 33:14.688
Who?

33:14.731 --> 33:17.517
The infected cadaver
we've been talking about.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.694
I-I just told you I'm doing
something I shouldn't do.

33:20.737 --> 33:23.349
It's not like I keep a
travel log and receipts.

33:23.392 --> 33:25.829
I-I don't know which
bodies came from where.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.353
Hell...
[chuckles lightly]

33:27.396 --> 33:28.876
...I do my best
not to remember.

33:28.919 --> 33:32.358
Then write down all the places
you have deals with.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.055
That I can do.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.666
But it's, uh, it's
gonna be a long list.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.758
Hi. My name is Michael.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.282
Uh, I'm an addict.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.632
Hey, Michael.

33:45.675 --> 33:50.071
So, well, I, uh, I have
this friend in the program,

33:50.115 --> 33:51.725
guy I really admire.

33:51.768 --> 33:54.771
He, uh, works the steps,
comes to meetings.

33:54.815 --> 33:58.514
But, uh, recently I can tell
he's been struggling.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.603
So, a few weeks ago,

34:00.647 --> 34:03.693
I put him onto a project
to keep him occupied.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.871
It didn't work.

34:08.916 --> 34:12.746
It's like
there's nothing I can do

34:12.789 --> 34:14.748
to get his attention,

34:14.791 --> 34:17.577
to pull him back.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.492
You know, um,
we come to these rooms

34:19.534 --> 34:24.018
to get help
and to give help.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.804
Sometimes it
doesn't work.

34:29.850 --> 34:34.681
I know you're thinking I should
mind my side of the street,

34:34.724 --> 34:38.815
worry about myself, but...

34:40.817 --> 34:43.690
...I can't.

34:43.733 --> 34:45.996
Not yet.

34:47.998 --> 34:52.393
If I need to get louder,
I'll get louder.

34:54.396 --> 34:57.443
But I'm going to make sure
my friend hears me.

35:04.319 --> 35:06.756
WATSON: So, I brought
you some tea.

35:08.671 --> 35:12.066
Thank you.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.503
It's late.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.853
So, I let you sleep in,

35:16.897 --> 35:20.248
but I have been up for a while,
working on a new theory.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.337
Yes, I am listening.So, what if
Eric Russo's body

35:22.381 --> 35:25.645
was able to fight off
the H7N5 virus?

35:25.688 --> 35:27.429
I thought you said
that was impossible.

35:27.473 --> 35:30.737
I did because it's
never happened before,

35:30.780 --> 35:32.826
but what if Eric
was the first?

35:32.869 --> 35:35.568
If he was, it would make
his body worth millions.

35:35.611 --> 35:39.311
Now I'm awake. Continue.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.443
So, I've been doing
some research into Eric's life

35:41.487 --> 35:43.315
and I noticed that he spent
a couple of years in China,

35:43.358 --> 35:44.664
teaching English

35:44.707 --> 35:47.449
in the same province
where H7N5 is found.

35:47.493 --> 35:48.972
So I called the school
and they confirmed

35:49.016 --> 35:51.323
that he came down with a bad flu
while he was there.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.846
Now, everyone just assumed
it was a mild strain

35:52.889 --> 35:54.717
because he survived.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.676
But you think it was H7N5.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.330
When you recover
from a virus,

35:58.373 --> 36:01.898
your system develops antibodies
to fight off future infections.

36:01.942 --> 36:05.206
So, if he had survived H7N5
once before,

36:05.250 --> 36:06.860
he would still have
the antibodies to combat it.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.905
A second exposure in New York
would not have hurt him

36:08.949 --> 36:10.646
'cause he would
have been immune.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.562
Well, technically, he still
would have caught the virus,

36:13.606 --> 36:14.998
but his symptoms
could've been so mild

36:15.042 --> 36:16.739
that they would have
gone unnoticed.

36:16.783 --> 36:21.962
Right. And yet the virus would
still be in his system, eh,

36:22.005 --> 36:23.659
meaning he could still
infect other people,

36:23.703 --> 36:25.226
even when dead.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.272
If you're right,

36:27.315 --> 36:28.969
that would resolve
our paradox

36:29.012 --> 36:31.232
and restore our theory of motive
for the two murders.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.234
I think it does more than that.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.844
So, I've been reading
some of the work

36:34.888 --> 36:37.847
they've been doing
on flu vaccines.

36:37.891 --> 36:40.850
Now, there is a theory
that antibodies from a survivor

36:40.894 --> 36:43.679
of a particularly
deadly flu could be used

36:43.723 --> 36:45.986
to develop a
universal flu vaccine,

36:46.029 --> 36:48.815
one capable of
preventing all flus.

36:51.905 --> 36:54.995
Hence the millions of dollars
you were talking about.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.910
Whoever developed such a vaccine

36:56.953 --> 36:59.913
would enjoy significant
financial reward,

36:59.956 --> 37:02.916
and Eric Russo's antibodies
would be quite the prize.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.744
The thing is, getting
access to his antibodies

37:04.787 --> 37:06.789
would have required
his consent.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.922
It's not something you could
do without his knowing.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.793
You would need
too much blood.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.752
So, you think perhaps
someone approached him

37:12.795 --> 37:14.493
and he refused
to participate?

37:14.536 --> 37:15.755
Or maybe they didn't
feel like sharing

37:15.798 --> 37:16.973
all the money they
were gonna make.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.410
Either way,

37:18.453 --> 37:20.586
they had to kill him
to get what they wanted.

37:20.629 --> 37:22.979
Our suspect would have to have
just the right combination

37:23.023 --> 37:24.807
of expertise and resources.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.244
As it turns out,

37:26.287 --> 37:28.376
Marcus and I just met
someone like that yesterday.

37:28.420 --> 37:29.595
Who?

37:29.638 --> 37:32.250
The author of that
paper you're holding.

37:38.081 --> 37:40.823
Dr. Selsky, the woman
we talked to at the D.O.H.?

37:40.867 --> 37:42.477
You think she killed Eric Russo

37:42.521 --> 37:46.351
so she could take his blood
and get rich off his antibodies?

37:46.394 --> 37:47.874
In fact, she probably didn't
even bother with his blood.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.528
The cells she would need,
they're called B-cells.

37:49.571 --> 37:51.617
They're found in greatest
abundance in the spleen.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.706
If it were me,
and I was killing him anyway,

37:53.749 --> 37:55.055
that's what I would take.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.492
Glad to know you
thought it through.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.146
So, either way,

37:59.189 --> 38:01.104
she killed Kareem Ludlow
and Victoria Garvey

38:01.148 --> 38:03.498
to cover up
what she'd done.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.674
And there was no sign
of struggle or forced entry

38:05.718 --> 38:06.936
at either of their homes.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.242
Any idea how she managed that?

38:08.286 --> 38:09.939
We know that Kareem
Ludlow was sick.

38:09.983 --> 38:12.333
And as you two established,
he'd been contacted

38:12.377 --> 38:13.987
by the Department
of Health.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.641
If we're right
about everything else,

38:15.684 --> 38:19.340
Victoria Garvey would also
be feeling under the weather.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.994
Selsky had Department of Health credentials.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.778
It's possible she used those

38:22.822 --> 38:24.040
to gain access
to their homes.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.694
WATSON:
She might have even told them

38:25.738 --> 38:27.087
that she had something
to make them feel better.

38:27.130 --> 38:29.307
A lethal dose of potassium
chloride, for example,

38:29.350 --> 38:30.699
would have cleared
their symptoms right up.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.788
After that, she would have
had to burn the bodies

38:32.832 --> 38:34.703
to dispose of any evidence
of the virus.

38:34.747 --> 38:36.444
Well, I get everything
you're saying,

38:36.488 --> 38:38.011
but between us and
the fire department,

38:38.054 --> 38:39.665
we've been over
those houses plenty.

38:39.708 --> 38:40.840
If you're right,

38:40.883 --> 38:42.450
she did a hell of a job.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.017
WATSON: True. But if I'm
right about something else,

38:44.060 --> 38:47.107
we'll have more than enough
evidence to make an arrest.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.676
What you're saying is insane.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.242
I've never even
heard of Eric Russo.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.070
We're pretty sure
that's a lie.

38:54.114 --> 38:57.291
You interviewed Wu Meili
and her family extensively.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.640
And we get that she wanted

38:58.684 --> 39:00.076
to keep her relationship
with Eric secret,

39:00.120 --> 39:01.904
but on her deathbed?

39:01.948 --> 39:03.123
She would have been
holding back information

39:03.166 --> 39:04.994
that could stop
a pandemic.

39:05.038 --> 39:07.040
We think it's more likely
she did tell you about Eric.

39:07.083 --> 39:08.563
And when you checked him out

39:08.607 --> 39:10.609
and discovered that
he was asymptomatic,

39:10.652 --> 39:13.133
you realized what
a valuable find he was.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.527
As the only known
survivor of H7N5,

39:15.570 --> 39:18.138
his antibodies would be
like the holy grail.

39:18.181 --> 39:19.835
So you took them.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.402
In addition to working here,

39:21.446 --> 39:23.622
we also know you're on staff
at Hamilton Hospital.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.667
That's where you do
your own research.

39:25.711 --> 39:28.061
We think that's also
where you met with Eric.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.411
Would've been easy enough for
you to use your privileges there

39:30.455 --> 39:32.457
to dispose of his body
along with others

39:32.500 --> 39:34.241
that had been donated
to science.

39:34.284 --> 39:37.287
The hospital sends those to
a crematorium to be destroyed.

39:37.331 --> 39:38.854
We reached out
to the crematorium

39:38.898 --> 39:40.726
that the hospital uses
and they confirmed

39:40.769 --> 39:43.642
that they received a body
matching Eric's description

39:43.685 --> 39:45.644
the day after
he was last seen.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.950
WATSON:
Unfortunately for you,

39:47.994 --> 39:50.257
someone at the crematorium made
a deal with a body broker

39:50.300 --> 39:52.868
and sold Eric's body
to a tissue bank.

39:52.912 --> 39:54.435
BELL:
Couple weeks after that,

39:54.479 --> 39:57.177
you receive the culture
from Kareem Ludlow's doctor.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.005
When it came back
positive for bird flu,

39:59.048 --> 40:02.182
you looked into it, found out
about Kareem's skin graft,

40:02.225 --> 40:03.879
and put two
and two together.

40:03.923 --> 40:05.446
You got the name
of the other person

40:05.490 --> 40:07.666
who received Eric's tissue
from the tissue bank,

40:07.709 --> 40:10.582
Victoria Garvey,
and you killed them both.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.018
So you're accusing me
of three murders.

40:12.061 --> 40:14.673
I'd like you both to leave,
so I can call my lawyer.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.675
You can call your lawyer
from the precinct.

40:16.718 --> 40:18.981
We've already executed
a search warrant

40:19.025 --> 40:20.853
on your lab
at Hamilton Hospital.

40:20.896 --> 40:23.246
We found a spleen
in your freezer.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.597
Go ahead.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.643
Tell us the DNA's not gonna
come back as Eric Russo's.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.996
GREGSON:
That'll be it.
Okay? Thanks.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.215
You wanted to see me?

40:35.258 --> 40:36.695
Yes. In here.

40:36.738 --> 40:38.044
Hmm.

40:39.959 --> 40:43.266
I wanted to let you know that I
spoke to the department doctor.

40:43.310 --> 40:46.356
She's granted you provisional
clearance to return to work.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.141
"Provisional."

40:48.184 --> 40:50.709
Yes.

40:50.752 --> 40:53.625
You go back to visit her once
a week until further notice.

40:53.668 --> 40:56.149
That's in addition to your
visits to your own neurologist,

40:56.192 --> 40:58.934
which you also have
to do once a week.

40:58.978 --> 41:01.110
They'll be comparing notes.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.809
You miss an appointment,
I hear about it.

41:03.852 --> 41:06.551
You don't follow their
instructions, I hear about it.

41:06.594 --> 41:09.205
Otherwise, as long as there
are no further incidents

41:09.249 --> 41:13.949
like the other day... the
doc's okay will stand.

41:13.993 --> 41:15.255
That's good.

41:15.298 --> 41:16.474
No.

41:16.517 --> 41:18.824
That's not good.

41:18.867 --> 41:20.826
Between you and me,

41:20.869 --> 41:22.175
I would prefer it
if you were sidelined

41:22.218 --> 41:25.047
until you're fully recovered.

41:25.091 --> 41:27.746
Maybe longer.
Maybe permanently.

41:27.789 --> 41:30.618
But I said I'd let
the docs decide

41:30.662 --> 41:32.968
and I'm gonna stick to my word.

41:33.012 --> 41:34.622
Look, I-I want you to know...

41:34.666 --> 41:37.277
I'm not finished.
I know you.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.280
I know you're perfectly
capable of gaming them,

41:40.323 --> 41:41.847
telling them whatever
they need to hear,

41:41.890 --> 41:43.979
whatever gets you
a clean bill of health.

41:44.023 --> 41:46.939
So I'm putting you on notice,

41:46.982 --> 41:49.811
that if I get so much as a whiff
of you not playing it straight,

41:49.855 --> 41:52.248
whether you stay or go

41:52.292 --> 41:55.034
won't be up
to the doctors anymore.

41:56.078 --> 41:58.254
You can trust me.

41:58.298 --> 42:00.909
Prove it.
