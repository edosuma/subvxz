00:53.000 --> 00:56.916
Cid said the Vanguard Axis is
notorious for illegal smuggling.

00:57.416 --> 00:59.083
So be ready for anything.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.583
We'll make the delivery.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.500
Echo, Omega. Guard the ship.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.416
Proceed.

01:29.666 --> 01:31.750
You have the forgeries?

01:36.333 --> 01:39.291
We need to ascertain their viability.

01:39.916 --> 01:41.458
That will not be necessary.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.750
I created these chain codes myself.

01:44.291 --> 01:46.041
They will fool the Empire.

01:46.041 --> 01:48.333
Your assurance is meaningless.

01:48.916 --> 01:50.083
Check each one.

02:12.666 --> 02:16.083
There's something off about this place.

02:16.625 --> 02:17.875
I don't like it.

02:17.875 --> 02:19.333
Yeah. Me neither.

02:19.333 --> 02:21.000
But we're not staying for long.

02:21.541 --> 02:22.541
I'll prep the ship.

02:51.041 --> 02:53.208
Stop! You're hurting him!

02:53.208 --> 02:54.541
Halt, humanoid.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.833
Do not interfere
with Vanguard Axis business.

03:03.333 --> 03:04.458
No!

03:10.791 --> 03:12.958
More are coming. Hurry!

03:56.083 --> 03:57.083
Halt.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.125
Not that way.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.583
What are you doing?

04:08.583 --> 04:10.500
You need to go before they find you.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.416
Omega, let's get back to the ship.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.416
It's okay. He's a friend.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.125
Wait!

04:21.750 --> 04:24.000
Those droids are after him. Come on!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.833
<i>We have a situation.</i>

04:35.458 --> 04:36.458
Problem?

04:44.583 --> 04:48.250
The cause of that blaster fire is
either Echo or Omega.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.666
Most likely Omega.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.958
<i>Hunter, we need backup now.</i>

04:54.000 --> 04:57.375
What sort of treachery is this?

04:57.375 --> 04:59.000
Stay back!

05:04.583 --> 05:05.625
They're with us.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.666
I would advise you to take your soldiers

05:09.666 --> 05:13.000
and extricate yourselves
from the situation.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.166
No! They're going to hurt him.

05:15.166 --> 05:18.333
Oh, on the contrary.

05:18.333 --> 05:21.708
The Wookiee is worth a great deal
to our buyer.

05:22.291 --> 05:23.833
Alive.

05:23.833 --> 05:26.833
You can't smuggle living beings.

05:26.833 --> 05:28.750
For the right price,

05:29.375 --> 05:31.875
I can do whatever I want.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.833
Now stand down or be destroyed.

05:53.958 --> 05:55.125
Get to the ship!

05:55.125 --> 05:56.208
Come on!

05:58.708 --> 05:59.791
This way!

06:09.708 --> 06:11.000
Hurry!

06:31.833 --> 06:34.333
Why is he sitting back there alone?

06:35.125 --> 06:36.791
Because he's scared.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.583
He's been through a lot.

06:41.375 --> 06:42.875
Well, he still needs to eat.

06:50.708 --> 06:53.083
Here. You look hungry.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.500
What's wrong?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.416
He doesn't trust us.

07:04.416 --> 07:08.666
Well, seeing how all clones
were given an order to execute the Jedi,

07:08.666 --> 07:11.208
he has good reason to be cautious.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.625
I'm sorry about what happened.

07:13.625 --> 07:16.625
But we are not like the other clones.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.333
We did not follow that order.

07:19.958 --> 07:22.125
And we don't work for the Empire either.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.833
Hunter's telling the truth.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.250
You don't have to be afraid of us.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.041
It's okay. Eat.

07:42.375 --> 07:44.625
I'm Omega. What's your name?

07:48.208 --> 07:49.750
My Wookiee is a little rusty,

07:49.750 --> 07:53.500
but I think he says his name is Gungi.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.000
You catch that?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.250
He's been on the run
since Order 66,

08:02.250 --> 08:05.166
and was attempting to reach
the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk

08:05.166 --> 08:07.791
before he was captured
by those smuggling droids.

08:08.375 --> 08:11.458
I'm not sure how you survived this long
on your own,

08:11.458 --> 08:12.916
but it's impressive.

08:14.208 --> 08:17.333
If he's trying to get to his homeworld,
we can take him.

08:17.333 --> 08:20.000
Been a while since we've been to Kashyyyk.

08:25.291 --> 08:28.333
The Empire could have
outposts there by now.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.625
We don't know if it's safe for him there.

08:31.208 --> 08:33.458
He's a Jedi.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.083
He's not safe anywhere.

08:50.625 --> 08:52.541
We're heading to a village we know of.

08:53.083 --> 08:55.291
The Wookiees there
should be able to help you.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.541
I've locked into the coordinates.

08:57.541 --> 09:00.166
But I'm picking up
heavy smoke and deforestation.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.583
Keep an eye out for Imperial outposts.

09:03.416 --> 09:04.833
Oh, and kid.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.791
Keep that laser sword hidden.

09:06.791 --> 09:09.875
It, uh, draws attention we don't want.

09:57.875 --> 10:00.291
Do you remember anything
about this planet?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.208
What did he say?

10:03.208 --> 10:05.000
From his dreams.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.416
Here. I'll take care of it.

10:27.666 --> 10:29.750
Whoa! Oh.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.666
They're swarming us.

10:34.666 --> 10:36.583
Hold your fire.

10:42.583 --> 10:46.166
He says, "They will not attack
unless we pose a threat."

11:23.208 --> 11:26.916
According to my telemetry,
the village is straight ahead.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.791
Tanks came through here.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.583
The Empire incinerated
the entire village.

12:10.833 --> 12:13.083
The Empire destroyed our home too.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.208
Don't worry.

12:15.208 --> 12:16.541
We'll find your people.

12:36.583 --> 12:37.583
What do you see?

12:39.375 --> 12:40.541
 Trandoshans.

12:40.541 --> 12:42.458
And they have a Wookiee hostage.

12:43.750 --> 12:47.166
How did they get their hands
on Imperial tanks?

12:52.458 --> 12:57.208
Commander Venomor,
we've found more of those carved stones.

12:58.041 --> 13:00.291
<i>Stay on schedule.</i>

13:00.291 --> 13:01.875
<i>Blast them to dust.</i>

13:19.375 --> 13:20.833
Hunter, Gungi.

13:23.708 --> 13:25.000
Oh, no.

13:27.208 --> 13:31.000
This one must have a death wish.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.166
We need to stop the flames
from spreading.

14:41.916 --> 14:43.000
Start digging.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.166
More Trandoshans?

15:16.166 --> 15:17.625
No.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.708
Something bigger.

16:01.541 --> 16:03.833
Her name is Yanna.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.791
She appears to be leading them.

16:05.791 --> 16:08.541
We are returning him
to his homeworld.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.875
But he doesn't know
what village he's from.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.166
We were soldiers of the Republic.

16:32.791 --> 16:36.625
But let's just say
we don't see eye-to-eye with the Empire.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.583
We came because Gungi was in trouble.

16:43.458 --> 16:46.208
Jedi or not, he's still a child.

16:47.541 --> 16:48.916
He needs his people.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.958
What do we have here?

17:13.708 --> 17:15.291
Lightsaber marks.

17:15.291 --> 17:17.000
A surviving Jedi?

17:17.708 --> 17:19.875
We need to notify Imperial command.

17:19.875 --> 17:22.208
Not if I find the Jedi first.

17:25.291 --> 17:27.166
Raze the jungle to its roots.

17:27.166 --> 17:30.833
A hundred Wookiee pelts
to whoever finds the Jedi.

17:52.833 --> 17:55.666
Uh, no, thanks.

17:55.666 --> 17:57.583
You don't know what you're missing.

18:00.916 --> 18:03.041
Yanna's agreed
to let Gungi stay with them.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.833
What about the Trandoshans?

18:05.541 --> 18:08.916
The Empire's been using them
to strip the planet's resources.

18:08.916 --> 18:11.583
Many of the villagers have fled deeper
into the jungle.

18:11.583 --> 18:15.541
Yanna's scouts are reporting
a large convoy headed in this direction.

18:15.541 --> 18:17.125
She says to leave.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.958
Hunter,
the Wookiees were our allies for years.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.375
We have to do something.

18:25.708 --> 18:28.375
We'll stay and help you fight them.

18:32.041 --> 18:34.875
You don't have to do this alone.

19:12.833 --> 19:14.291
What are they doing?

19:14.291 --> 19:17.125
They are asking the trees for help.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.458
They're talking to the trees?

19:19.458 --> 19:22.291
They believe
this planet belongs to the trees.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.291
And they are allies in this fight.

19:24.291 --> 19:26.583
We'll take all the allies we can get.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.625
Wrecker, found 'em.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.375
The Trandoshan convoy's closing in.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.291
The trees have a plan?

19:58.041 --> 19:59.041
All right.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.000
Whatever they say.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.541
The tracks have broken off.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.791
There's no trace of them.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.666
They can't run far.

20:18.625 --> 20:19.791
Ambush!

20:22.375 --> 20:23.583
Crush them!

20:23.583 --> 20:25.750
Take what's left as trophies.

20:38.041 --> 20:40.291
Stick to the plan.
Draw them into the nest.

21:16.791 --> 21:18.375
Jedi.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.958
Guess the trees knew what they were doing.

22:03.458 --> 22:04.875
Where did the kids go?

23:13.166 --> 23:14.250
Gungi!

23:33.041 --> 23:35.833
The fire!
It's spreading too fast!

23:37.458 --> 23:39.125
Tech, gather all the Wookiees.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.500
You know, I could get used to this.

24:15.708 --> 24:17.500
Hmm. Not bad.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.083
They're both just kids.

24:35.791 --> 24:37.208
But they don't get to be.

24:37.875 --> 24:39.875
Not in this galaxy.

24:42.125 --> 24:45.208
"When a young one leaves, the trees weep.

24:45.916 --> 24:49.083
But when they return, the trees sing."

24:49.583 --> 24:52.041
"As this child has found his new home,

24:52.541 --> 24:56.708
perhaps, one day,
we all will find a new path."

24:57.958 --> 25:01.708
Hopefully... [sighs] ...one far away from war.
