00:04.147 --> 00:06.691
(soccer game on television)

00:13.281 --> 00:15.283
I'll be at Paulie's
if you need me.

00:30.924 --> 00:32.801
See you at the wedding?

00:35.387 --> 00:37.472
(television volume increases)

00:37.472 --> 00:39.015
I guess.

00:44.020 --> 00:45.980
Get it, girl,
get it, girl,

00:45.980 --> 00:48.400
get it, girl.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.027
Wait, since when are
you a wedding planner?

00:51.027 --> 00:53.446
Since I printed
this certificate.

00:53.446 --> 00:54.989
What; It's about flowers,

00:54.989 --> 00:56.658
food, and the dollar dance.

00:56.658 --> 00:58.159
Why shouldn't I
make that paper?

00:58.159 --> 00:59.786
Get that paper.

00:59.786 --> 01:01.246
Tia Vanessa is on it,

01:01.246 --> 01:02.997
and she's sharing the wealth.

01:02.997 --> 01:05.166
You're gonna be
the flower girl

01:05.166 --> 01:07.669
and Mommy's gonna teach
the bride and groom to dance.

01:07.669 --> 01:08.878
Not for free.

01:08.878 --> 01:10.255
Hoo.

01:10.255 --> 01:13.758
You booked a music video and
now you're all about the cash?

01:13.758 --> 01:15.969
Good girl.

01:15.969 --> 01:17.220
That's right.

01:17.220 --> 01:19.806
So, can you afford me?

01:19.806 --> 01:21.725
It pays $200.

01:21.725 --> 01:23.643
I'll take that as a yes.

01:23.643 --> 01:25.979
Minus my 20%.

01:25.979 --> 01:27.355
Brush up on your bachata.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.398
Hernan has two left feet

01:28.398 --> 01:32.026

Wedding cake.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.404
Our flowers for La Virgen.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.530
Check.

02:17.530 --> 02:21.951
Lasso and garter belt.

I don't have
that on my list.

Camila and Gina are
getting them right now.

02:34.422 --> 02:35.423
Well, what about you?

02:35.423 --> 02:36.591
I mean, we've been everywhere.

02:36.591 --> 02:39.135
Is there any one
that you liked?

02:39.135 --> 02:41.638
Ugh, I hated them all.

02:41.638 --> 02:43.681
What else you got?

02:43.681 --> 02:44.682
A headache.

02:44.682 --> 02:46.893
Hey, I heard that.

02:46.893 --> 02:49.771
Even after deleting all those
stupid ass Bootie Bank pics,

02:49.771 --> 02:51.397
I can't face Caleb.

02:51.397 --> 02:54.776
And what sucks is Eddie
thinks it's all my fault.

02:54.776 --> 02:56.736
I just want to run and hide.

02:58.655 --> 03:01.282
Hello, are you listening?

03:01.282 --> 03:02.826
Yeah.

03:02.826 --> 03:05.495
It's just, you know,

03:05.495 --> 03:07.121
what we talked about.

03:12.043 --> 03:14.754
You mean the abortion?

03:14.754 --> 03:17.173
Are you having
second thoughts?

03:17.173 --> 03:19.050
Not really.

03:19.050 --> 03:22.428
No, it's just...

03:22.428 --> 03:24.430
I wish things
were different.

03:26.975 --> 03:28.476
(sighs)

03:28.476 --> 03:31.312
But I know I made
the right choice

03:31.312 --> 03:32.480
for me.

03:34.190 --> 03:35.817
I went to the
clinic this morning

03:35.817 --> 03:37.860
and I took the first pill.

03:37.860 --> 03:39.404
The Plan B pill?

03:39.404 --> 03:42.282
No, it's too late for that.

03:42.282 --> 03:43.366
The Plan B is
the one you take

03:43.366 --> 03:44.826
after you have
unprotected sex

03:44.826 --> 03:46.828
so you don't get pregnant.

03:46.828 --> 03:48.329
I had to take
the abortion pill.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.999
So what happens next?

03:50.999 --> 03:54.794
I take the second set of
pills at home tomorrow.

03:54.794 --> 03:57.880
You want me to be
there when you do?

03:57.880 --> 04:00.466
You don't have to.

04:00.466 --> 04:03.636
I want to.

04:03.636 --> 04:05.179
Thanks, sissy.

04:05.179 --> 04:06.931
I got you.

04:06.931 --> 04:08.099
Come here.

04:10.685 --> 04:11.853
Now, after all this,

04:11.853 --> 04:13.438
you're gonna get on
birth control, right?

04:13.438 --> 04:14.689
(laughs)

04:14.689 --> 04:18.109
Um, I think this dress
pretty much counts

04:18.109 --> 04:19.777
as birth control.

04:19.777 --> 04:21.279
I know, right?

04:21.279 --> 04:22.322
No worries.

04:22.322 --> 04:24.532
I'm gonna get an IUD.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.367
And a banner ad
is top of page.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.493
The biggest objection
you're gonna get

04:27.493 --> 04:29.787
is that there is no ROI
in brand advertising,

04:29.787 --> 04:31.539
but we measure CPMs and CPIs.

04:31.539 --> 04:32.665
Oh, and don't forget, we--

04:32.665 --> 04:34.083
Wait--Paulie.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.710
Yo no hablo ad sales, okay?

04:35.710 --> 04:37.086
I know burritos, bro.

04:37.086 --> 04:38.546
I don't know banner ads.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.006
I should have never
quit the taqueria, man.

04:40.006 --> 04:41.925
No, you made
the right choice.

04:41.925 --> 04:44.218
Believe me, all right?

04:44.218 --> 04:45.386
Is your dad still pissed?

04:45.386 --> 04:47.013
I wouldn't know, man,
he's not talking to me.

04:47.013 --> 04:48.723
Just give it time, all right?

04:48.723 --> 04:50.099
Just give it time
and you'll eventually

04:50.099 --> 04:51.893
get this sales thing and
your dad will come around.

04:51.893 --> 04:54.228
-Don't trip.
-Attention, bros.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.064
(bell ringing)

04:56.064 --> 04:59.400
I just sold the
12th time-buy!

04:59.400 --> 05:00.610
(laughs)

05:02.236 --> 05:04.948
All right, guys,
happy hour's on daddy.

05:04.948 --> 05:06.658
Let's go, come on!

05:06.658 --> 05:08.284
Ooh, happy hour, yes.

05:08.284 --> 05:09.911
Two words I
do understand.

05:12.997 --> 05:13.998
Yo, Brandy.

05:13.998 --> 05:15.083
Oh, hi, Gina, how are--

05:15.083 --> 05:17.210
oh, yeah, sure.

05:17.210 --> 05:19.963
So, I was thinking
you're the only other person

05:19.963 --> 05:21.339
that had my
Bootie Bank password.

05:21.339 --> 05:23.758
It wasn't me, I swear.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.677
Listen, I'm a victim too.

05:25.677 --> 05:26.678
Didn't you know?

05:26.678 --> 05:28.763
We all got hacked.

05:28.763 --> 05:31.432
Yeah, I think it maybe
might have happened

05:31.432 --> 05:32.600
at dance camp.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.644
Do you remember Megan
from Saint Pius?

05:34.644 --> 05:36.729
Yeah, she said that her
photos were leaked too.

05:36.729 --> 05:37.897
Really?

05:40.024 --> 05:41.901
If you don't believe me,
which I totally get,

05:41.901 --> 05:44.988
but you totally should,
just call Megan.

05:44.988 --> 05:46.948
Can you believe that
Gina's still fronting?

05:46.948 --> 05:47.991
She got me punched.

05:47.991 --> 05:49.534
That shit ain't right.

05:49.534 --> 05:51.077
Team Eddie.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.081
Hey, you know who you
should take to the wedding?

05:55.081 --> 05:56.124
-Who?
-There's a chick

05:56.124 --> 05:57.250
from the third floor.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.376
(scoffs)

05:58.376 --> 05:59.752
Yo, that's dumb,
I'm not gonna take her,

05:59.752 --> 06:01.170
-that's not my type.
-What?

06:01.170 --> 06:03.297
Man, don't tell me you're
still stuck on Maya.

06:03.297 --> 06:04.382
How many times
I gotta tell you

06:04.382 --> 06:05.425
me and Maya are through?

06:05.425 --> 06:06.843
Please, man, that's
what you said last time,

06:06.843 --> 06:07.969
then you guys hooked up.

06:07.969 --> 06:09.470
"That's what you
said last time and guys--"

06:09.470 --> 06:10.513
(frustrated grunt)

06:10.513 --> 06:11.639
Beat your ass again!

06:11.639 --> 06:12.724
Mm-hm!

06:12.724 --> 06:14.225
Maybe I'll just roll
solo to the wedding.

06:14.225 --> 06:16.102
-How about that?
-No, no, no, no, no, no, man.

06:16.102 --> 06:17.645
Look, I know you love losing,

06:17.645 --> 06:18.688
but don't be a loser, man.

06:18.688 --> 06:19.814
Pick up your phone.

06:19.814 --> 06:20.940
Get your ass a date.

06:20.940 --> 06:21.983
I'm gonna go piss real quick.

06:21.983 --> 06:23.109
No, wait, wait, wait,
take another shot

06:23.109 --> 06:24.861
-of tequila.
-Hell no, man, I'm good.

06:24.861 --> 06:26.320
Maybe you should
slow down a bit,

06:26.320 --> 06:27.780
you still got work to do.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.491
Yeah, you're right,
you're right.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.909
More for me.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.543
(sighs)

06:43.963 --> 06:46.549
Hey, it's Jacob.

06:49.802 --> 06:51.846
I just wanted to tell
you that I love you,

06:51.846 --> 06:55.808
I miss you, and I hope
that you call me back.

06:55.808 --> 06:57.393
Whoa.

06:57.393 --> 06:59.103
Man, Jacob and
Maya just broke up

06:59.103 --> 07:01.189
and he's already
drunk dialing you.

07:01.189 --> 07:02.607
Thirteen times.

07:02.607 --> 07:04.025
So what are you gonna do?

07:04.025 --> 07:05.610
Well, in the last
message he told me

07:05.610 --> 07:07.028
to forget
everything he said,

07:07.028 --> 07:08.154
but I don't know
how I'm gonna pretend

07:08.154 --> 07:10.573
like this didn't happen.

07:10.573 --> 07:11.616
Well, you're not
thinking of giving

07:11.616 --> 07:14.160
that borracho
another chance, right?

07:16.579 --> 07:18.915
Damn.

07:18.915 --> 07:20.875
After Pedro, you
really lowered the bar.

07:20.875 --> 07:21.959
Vanessa.

07:21.959 --> 07:24.253
Tell me I'm wrong then.

07:24.253 --> 07:26.672
I'm not going to
go back to Jacob.

07:26.672 --> 07:28.216
The fool broke my heart.

07:28.216 --> 07:30.593
Mm-hm.

07:30.593 --> 07:32.678
Delete, delete, delete.

07:32.678 --> 07:33.721
Hold on, I want
to hear the one

07:33.721 --> 07:34.889
where he butchers
the Bieber song again.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.015
No, Vanessa, no!

07:36.015 --> 07:37.892
Please, I want to
make it my ringtone.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.019
-Delete.
-You drunk dialed Ceci?

07:40.019 --> 07:43.147
That tequila's getting
you into trouble, man.

07:43.147 --> 07:44.315
And I think I
might have told her

07:44.315 --> 07:45.399
that I love her.

07:45.399 --> 07:46.567
(laughs)

07:46.567 --> 07:47.819
All right, let me
get this straight.

07:47.819 --> 07:49.695
You've been tripping
on Ceci this whole time

07:49.695 --> 07:51.864
and is that why you
broke up with Maya?

07:51.864 --> 07:53.074
Well, yeah.

07:53.074 --> 07:54.784
Ceci's not
gonna believe me,

07:54.784 --> 07:55.785
nor take me back.

07:55.785 --> 07:57.578
You gotta invite her
to the wedding.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.163
You know, you could
change her mind there.

07:59.163 --> 08:02.416
Like flowers, big ass
dresses, and love songs.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.377
Women cream for that shit.

08:04.377 --> 08:07.421
There's no way that I'm
gonna call her again.

08:07.421 --> 08:08.548
You could ask her in person.

08:08.548 --> 08:10.758
I heard she's teaching
your dad dance lessons.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.301
You gotta crash that shit.

08:12.301 --> 08:13.427
Crash that shit, what
are you talking about?

08:13.427 --> 08:14.762
I already know
how to bachata.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.390
No, you don't.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.392
Hey.

08:19.392 --> 08:21.394
So that's why they
pay you the big bucks.

08:21.394 --> 08:22.770
That's right.

08:22.770 --> 08:23.896
Wait, so did you end
up closing that deal

08:23.896 --> 08:25.064
with the talent agency?

08:25.064 --> 08:26.649
Um, no, I didn't,
but I'm this close.

08:26.649 --> 08:28.442
I gotta go to
Vegas tomorrow, so...

08:28.442 --> 08:29.527
-Vegas?
-Yeah.

08:29.527 --> 08:30.778
You're not gonna make it
to my dad's wedding?

08:30.778 --> 08:33.281
Oh, shit, I
gotta take this.

08:33.281 --> 08:36.826
Wait--oh yeah, but don't
forget, bachata, all right?

08:36.826 --> 08:38.703

make things happen.

Especially in this

12:36.065 --> 12:37.483

She got hacked
at dance camp too.

12:57.586 --> 13:00.214
-A lot of the girls did.
-I told you so.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.716
Hey, my phone wasn't hacked.

13:02.716 --> 13:05.678
I guess it only happened
to the popular girls.

13:05.678 --> 13:08.139
Okay, let's go ahead

13:08.139 --> 13:10.057
We're supposed to have
seven dance routines down

13:10.057 --> 13:12.143

13:12.143 --> 13:14.311
So go ahead and
give me two lines.

13:14.311 --> 13:16.564
Uh, Zoe, I want you up here.

13:16.564 --> 13:20.192
Uh, Tomas behind her
and Brandy behind him.

13:20.192 --> 13:23.279
Yo, my bad, but I really
thought that was you.

don't know me.

13:25.990 --> 13:27.950
I guess I don't.
