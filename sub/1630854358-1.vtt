WEBVTT

03:07.916 --> 03:09.166
Attack!

03:09.666 --> 03:11.083
Attack!

03:12.041 --> 03:15.750
Go! Come on! Faster!

03:18.166 --> 03:21.000
Heinrich, come on! Forwards! Come now!

03:21.083 --> 03:22.791
To the ladders!

03:22.875 --> 03:24.291
On my command!

03:24.375 --> 03:25.583
Forwards!

03:27.708 --> 03:30.250
Heinrich! Get out there!

03:30.333 --> 03:32.458
All of you, go!

03:33.333 --> 03:35.541
Come on! Get out of there!

03:35.625 --> 03:38.666
Go, Heinrich! Get out there now!

03:39.291 --> 03:40.541
Attack!

03:41.125 --> 03:42.083
Attack!

03:46.000 --> 03:48.083
Go! Forwards!

04:13.333 --> 04:14.458
Heinrich!

04:15.666 --> 04:16.833
Heinrich!

04:22.916 --> 04:26.000
-Attack! Attack!
-Attack!

05:09.333 --> 05:14.166
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

06:45.583 --> 06:46.916
Come on!

08:15.500 --> 08:19.666
NORTHERN GERMANY
SPRING 1917

08:21.333 --> 08:24.500
THIRD YEAR OF WAR

08:41.875 --> 08:44.916
Paul! Paul!

08:47.875 --> 08:50.333
-Paul! Well?
-So?

08:51.000 --> 08:51.875
Mhm.

08:52.416 --> 08:54.375
-Well then?
-I don't know.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.375
-Does he know we're all going?
-Yes, of course.

08:57.458 --> 08:58.458
Staying at home?

08:58.541 --> 09:00.916
My God, you're tied
to your mother's apron strings, my friend.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.291
Give me it, I'll scribble something.

09:04.375 --> 09:07.291
-It has to be signed by his parents.
-Well, someone. Come on, pass it here.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.583
-That won't work, they'll find out.
-How will they?

09:10.250 --> 09:11.083
Well?

09:11.166 --> 09:12.875
Is his mother a pen pal of theirs?

09:16.583 --> 09:18.541
-Give me your pen.
-Ah, I'm sorry.

09:18.625 --> 09:19.458
Oh!

09:19.541 --> 09:20.375
Ludwig.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.125
You mustn't. Your father will hit you.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.125
Have you got a better idea?
I'm not being left behind here.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.583
<i>Jawohl!</i>

09:41.666 --> 09:44.833
Congratulations, Private Bäumer.
We're going to the front.

09:44.916 --> 09:46.083
A dead man walking.

09:48.166 --> 09:51.458
You stand here
on the threshold of existence.

09:52.708 --> 09:54.375
Remember this moment.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.791
It is a great moment.

09:57.875 --> 10:03.000
For in years to come, you will be judged
based on what you dared to become today.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.875
The iron youth of Germany.

10:06.791 --> 10:07.875
My friends,

10:08.416 --> 10:11.166
we are fortunate
to be alive at a great time.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.708
Your deeds will be the water

10:13.791 --> 10:16.791
nourishing the growth
of a strong and noble route.

10:16.875 --> 10:19.000
Stand still and listen up, Leinemann!

10:19.791 --> 10:21.958
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.458
I am certain that I will see
most of you again soon, here at home.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.750
Your sword returned to its scabbard
with honour and respect.

10:33.875 --> 10:37.541
A cross crafted from iron
proudly displayed upon your chest.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.791
However, take heed of this.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.458
In the darkest of hours,
let me assure you it will happen,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.208
that prior to an attack,
you will harbour doubts.

10:48.708 --> 10:51.666
But this is not the time
to concede to any mental weakness.

10:52.166 --> 10:56.875
Any unsteadiness, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the fatherland!

10:56.958 --> 10:59.833
For modern war is like a game of chess.

10:59.916 --> 11:02.416
It is never about an individual soldier.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.833
Our only care
is for the entirety of the body.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.541
You have the chance to earn the right
to wear the uniforms you have been given.

11:10.291 --> 11:13.625
And by going to the front line
in Flanders, we'll pierce the enemy.

11:13.708 --> 11:17.416
And then you will, in a few short weeks,

11:17.500 --> 11:20.125
finally march on Paris!

11:20.208 --> 11:21.666
Yeah!

11:21.750 --> 11:23.041
Our future,

11:23.708 --> 11:25.333
the future of <i>Deutschland</i>,

11:26.458 --> 11:29.125
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.833
My friends, that is you, you see!

11:32.916 --> 11:33.875
Yeah!

11:33.958 --> 11:35.916
Therefore, off to the camps

11:36.000 --> 11:39.666
for the Kaiser, God, and the fatherland!

11:39.750 --> 11:41.250
Yeah!

11:52.333 --> 11:53.166
Next.

11:54.416 --> 11:55.250
Next.

11:58.833 --> 11:59.791
Next.

12:00.666 --> 12:02.208
-Next.
-Next.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.041
Bäumer, Paul.
53 Wiesengrund.

12:04.541 --> 12:07.708
Born November 18th, 1899. Correct?

12:07.791 --> 12:08.666
<i>Jawohl</i>, sir.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.375
Next.

12:16.125 --> 12:16.958
Paul.

12:19.041 --> 12:21.291
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

12:21.375 --> 12:22.208
Yes.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.125
Is everything alright?

12:26.958 --> 12:28.708
Yes. I'm eager to get on with it.

12:29.625 --> 12:30.458
Move along.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.583
Here he comes.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.375
-Emil Hermann.
-Name and address.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.833
-And the next.
-Excuse me.

12:36.916 --> 12:38.541
It already belongs to someone.

12:39.916 --> 12:44.083
Ah, yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

12:44.166 --> 12:45.791
Here. It's yours.

12:46.458 --> 12:47.583
Thank you.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.416
I remember it, you were.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.833
Oh, Ludwig, will you be snatching away
all the ladies from us now?

13:10.916 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.000
My concern is that you don't shoot us.

13:24.958 --> 13:26.375
She won't wait, Franz.

13:27.958 --> 13:28.875
She won't do it.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.291
You lady killer, you.

14:17.583 --> 14:21.500
LA MALMAISON, NORTHERN FRANCE
25 KM TO THE WESTERN FRONT

14:33.416 --> 14:37.333
-Your name?
-Kropp. Albert Kropp, sir.

14:37.416 --> 14:39.416
Do you like dirty girls,
Kropp?

14:41.916 --> 14:43.583
Do you like dirty girls?

14:45.041 --> 14:47.041
Uh, no. I don't, sir.

14:47.125 --> 14:49.125
So why
do you sleep with one then?

14:49.833 --> 14:51.958
Report for guard duty at three o'clock.

14:52.875 --> 14:55.833
Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in a godforsaken shithole.

14:55.916 --> 14:59.833
And you'll kindly do so with a clean G98.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.458
You will pamper it.

15:01.541 --> 15:03.000
You will love it.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.208
And damn it,
you will keep it as immaculate

15:05.291 --> 15:07.166
as the thighs of the Holy Virgin.

15:07.833 --> 15:09.166
Do we understand each other?

15:09.250 --> 15:10.916
-<i>Jawohl</i>, sir!
-<i>Jawohl</i>, sir!

15:11.000 --> 15:13.875
Welcome
to the 78th Reserve Infantry Regiment.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.083
We are now on the Western Front.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.666
-Welcome to Paris!
-Yeah! Welcome to Paris!

15:27.208 --> 15:28.041
Ah!

15:30.666 --> 15:31.958
Down there! Down there!

15:35.750 --> 15:37.625
Down there! This way!

15:41.625 --> 15:42.833
This way!

15:49.791 --> 15:52.833
-Go on! Over there on the right!
-Damn it, what happened?

15:53.708 --> 15:56.291
I have orders to hand over the company
to the front by 6:00 p.m.

15:56.375 --> 15:57.875
That you may, but on foot.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.916
You must give us the trucks, lieutenant.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.458
With all due respect, I have orders--

16:01.541 --> 16:03.500
Take the orders
and stick them up your arse.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.583
I have 40 men here
who are dying in the mud.

16:05.666 --> 16:06.875
Get out right now, will you?

16:09.666 --> 16:11.000
Everyone, get up.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.291
Come on, get on with it.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.125
You heard the staff surgeon.

16:19.250 --> 16:22.166
Faster, soldiers. Don't fall asleep here.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.708
Keep moving.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.541
-Franz Müller, correct?
-Yes.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.125
The supreme army command

16:36.208 --> 16:38.916
expects you to survive
at least six weeks of being here.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Would you like that,
in six weeks, to still be alive?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.375
-<i>Jawohl</i>, sir.
-Then walk quicker

16:42.458 --> 16:44.541
and stop dragging your feet
like you would do at home.

16:45.458 --> 16:46.958
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.125
Hurry up.

16:49.666 --> 16:51.708
We're not at a tea party here.

16:58.666 --> 17:00.125
Gas!

17:00.625 --> 17:02.958
-Gas!
-Gas!

17:03.041 --> 17:04.666
Gas!

17:04.750 --> 17:05.958
Gas!

17:07.250 --> 17:08.833
Gas masks on!

17:08.916 --> 17:11.458
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.875
If the French could aim better,

17:13.958 --> 17:18.291
you could scrape us all off the road
with a spoon and bury us in a saucepan.

17:18.833 --> 17:22.250
But one thing
that's as certain as amen in church.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.083
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.125
Eyes straight ahead.

17:43.375 --> 17:45.666
-Are you deaf?
-No, sir.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.458
I was just trying to put my mask on.

17:56.041 --> 17:59.500
Paul Bäumer,
you will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.041
You should eat something, man.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.375
Attention! Gas masks off!

18:06.458 --> 18:08.333
Gas masks off!

18:08.416 --> 18:09.500
Not you.

18:09.583 --> 18:12.041
You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

18:12.875 --> 18:14.708
Both you and that useless pig.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.583
Fall in line. March.

18:17.666 --> 18:18.875
Fall in line!

18:18.958 --> 18:21.375
Stay together and keep moving!

18:22.375 --> 18:24.166
Come on, hurry up!

18:24.250 --> 18:25.083
Go!

18:42.041 --> 18:45.166
Come on. Paul, come on.
Give me your knapsack.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.000
Next time, you carry mine.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.250
Congratulations, soldiers.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.166
This is your home now.

19:03.250 --> 19:04.250
Helmets off.

19:05.625 --> 19:08.541
I see the men have been enjoying
themselves in my absence, Steinberger.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.416
We were under barrage all night.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.583
The men are a mess.

19:11.666 --> 19:13.666
I think dry boots
would be a good place to begin.

19:14.208 --> 19:15.791
Oh, you'd rather we all drown then?

19:15.875 --> 19:18.833
Everyone pitch in!
Come on, bail out the trench.

19:19.916 --> 19:22.375
Get in line
to bail the water!

19:24.458 --> 19:26.208
What are you waiting for, Bäumer?

19:27.166 --> 19:31.083
Why are you still loitering here?
Go and help bail out the trenches.

19:31.166 --> 19:32.666
Throw a dog a piece of meat.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.291
Come on, all of you!

19:34.375 --> 19:35.958
It will always snap it up.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.875
Give a man power…

19:42.958 --> 19:44.333
Man is a beast.

19:45.583 --> 19:46.458
Drink.

19:50.333 --> 19:53.375
Katczinsky, come over here.
Give us a hand.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.125
Tonight, it'll be even worse.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.041
Sorry.

20:32.041 --> 20:32.875
Forget it.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.458
Somehow, this isn't how I imagined it.

20:36.541 --> 20:37.541
Just shut up, Ludwig.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.375
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.750
Stick them down your underwear.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.458
It always works for me.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.541
That will make it shoot better,
will it?

21:48.916 --> 21:50.750
-Did you hear that?
-Hear what?

21:52.250 --> 21:53.708
That sound. Listen.

21:53.791 --> 21:55.041
There's nothing there.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.291
Our first French to shoot.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.291
Calm down, Paulchen.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.666
There's someone out there.

22:26.791 --> 22:27.791
Who's there?

22:29.375 --> 22:30.250
Hey.

22:32.875 --> 22:33.875
Show yourself!

22:52.208 --> 22:53.416
Oh, no, no, no!

22:53.500 --> 22:56.333
I'm hit! I'm hit! I've been hit! Get off!

22:57.208 --> 22:59.375
-No, Paul. No.
-What's going on?

22:59.458 --> 23:00.541
You're fine.

23:07.916 --> 23:08.750
What is it?

23:09.666 --> 23:11.333
The others, over there. They shot at me.

23:17.333 --> 23:18.875
They saw the flash of your muzzle.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.208
Huh?

23:21.291 --> 23:22.791
From now on, keep your heads down.

23:22.875 --> 23:25.125
If you don't want to catch
the next bullet with your teeth,

23:25.208 --> 23:26.291
move ten meters to the left.

23:26.375 --> 23:29.125
Shoot, change cover.
Shoot, change cover. Understand?

23:30.875 --> 23:31.708
Yeah.

23:46.791 --> 23:48.291
Come on. Paul.

24:38.291 --> 24:41.083
Take cover! Take cover! Alarm!

24:44.041 --> 24:45.083
Here!

24:45.791 --> 24:48.333
Bäumer, come here. Quickly, come on.

24:49.000 --> 24:49.916
Into the bunker!

24:53.625 --> 24:55.875
Inside! Inside! Inside!

25:14.208 --> 25:15.458
"Be careful what you eat."

25:16.333 --> 25:19.000
That's what my mother said.

25:21.416 --> 25:23.125
-We'll always be together, won't we?
-Yeah.

25:23.208 --> 25:24.791
We'll stick together. We'll always be.

25:26.708 --> 25:30.166
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I need to go home.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.458
I need to go home.

25:52.166 --> 25:53.208
Creeping barrage.

25:57.083 --> 25:58.208
What?

25:59.458 --> 26:00.416
Every couple of minutes,

26:00.500 --> 26:02.416
the artillery barrage
makes an advance forward.

26:03.625 --> 26:04.916
And directly after that,

26:05.958 --> 26:07.583
the infantry moves forward.

26:09.250 --> 26:10.458
What are you saying, exactly?

26:11.166 --> 26:12.250
That's how they come.

26:33.291 --> 26:34.291
Where are you going?

26:34.375 --> 26:35.333
I'll come back.

26:36.083 --> 26:37.125
It's nearly over.

26:39.041 --> 26:41.041
-No! Let me go.
-Stay where you are.

26:41.125 --> 26:43.625
-Let me out of here. I want to get out.
-Calm down.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.083
Calm yourself.

26:50.583 --> 26:51.458
No!

26:55.875 --> 26:58.208
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

26:59.000 --> 26:59.875
Out!

28:00.833 --> 28:02.791
Hey, that's Paul!

28:02.875 --> 28:03.750
Albert!

28:03.833 --> 28:05.666
Come here, we found Paul!

28:14.416 --> 28:15.333
Paul!

28:17.708 --> 28:18.708
Are you alright?

28:19.875 --> 28:21.333
Is everything alright, Paul?

28:21.958 --> 28:23.583
Come on. Paul, come on.

28:23.666 --> 28:24.833
I'll help you.

28:24.916 --> 28:27.458
Come on. Get up, will you? Sit down.

28:27.541 --> 28:28.625
Are you injured?

28:28.708 --> 28:30.541
Paul, are you injured?

28:30.625 --> 28:32.583
-Can you hear me?
-We need help over here!

28:32.666 --> 28:34.541
-See you later, Paul.
-We'll see you later, Paul.

28:46.375 --> 28:48.250
Go on! Go on!

28:52.083 --> 28:53.208
Here's another one.

28:54.041 --> 28:55.125
We need help!

28:58.708 --> 28:59.541
Steady.

29:00.541 --> 29:01.375
Steady.

29:06.708 --> 29:07.541
That's it.

29:09.666 --> 29:10.541
I've got you.

29:12.833 --> 29:14.041
Careful, careful.

29:23.625 --> 29:25.375
Now we're in camp. Sit down.

29:25.458 --> 29:26.291
You're alright.

29:27.541 --> 29:29.166
Nice one. Let's have a look at you.

29:30.250 --> 29:31.500
Hold still, hold still.

29:33.666 --> 29:34.958
Yeah, you're going to be alright.

29:37.125 --> 29:38.958
Right, put pressure on it.
Don't let him get up.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.666
Katczinsky, back to work.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.291
And you? Are you injured?

29:55.791 --> 29:56.625
No.

29:57.125 --> 29:58.666
Then start gathering.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.416
Man, man, man!

30:07.916 --> 30:09.416
No rest for the wicked.

30:10.083 --> 30:11.416
It's the same every day.

33:08.041 --> 33:09.791
Come on! Keep working!

33:10.583 --> 33:11.791
We don't have all day.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.791
Albrecht, Karl. Diepholz.

34:28.875 --> 34:29.708
18 MONTHS LATER

34:29.791 --> 34:32.875
September 14th, 1898.

34:37.666 --> 34:40.375
Blumenthal, Samuel.

34:41.791 --> 34:45.625
Dresden. November 6th, 1900.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.416
Yesterday was his birthday.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.416
Von Gallwitz, Gustav.

34:55.500 --> 34:59.833
Osnabrück, June 20th, '99.

35:01.416 --> 35:02.666
Götz Lüttwitz--

35:02.750 --> 35:03.625
That's enough.

35:13.291 --> 35:15.666
SUPREME ARMY COMMAND
7 NOVEMBER, 1918

35:15.750 --> 35:17.583
-She's a looker.
-Let's see.

35:17.666 --> 35:18.625
She's alright.

35:41.541 --> 35:42.583
Herr Erzberger.

35:52.166 --> 35:53.333
God be with us.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.666
Once more, over 40,000 killed
in the last few weeks alone.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.250
That should convince the general staff.

36:02.791 --> 36:04.916
I think the gentlemen know it's over.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.583
We all know that.

36:13.916 --> 36:15.250
The General Field Marshal.

36:18.375 --> 36:19.291
Mm.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.041
CHAMPAGNE, FRANCE
OCCUPIED TERRITORY

37:01.375 --> 37:03.125
-Thank you.
-<i>Jawohl</i>.

37:15.791 --> 37:17.208
Paul, if we keep up this pace,

37:17.291 --> 37:19.708
we won't have conquered France
for 180 years.

37:20.750 --> 37:23.500
I worked it out.

37:23.583 --> 37:25.166
Don't let them catch you, Kat.

37:26.875 --> 37:27.875
Never.

37:38.083 --> 37:38.916
Come on.

37:42.083 --> 37:44.250
Explain to me
how this is worth dying for in your mind.

37:46.416 --> 37:48.000
When you're starving, you'll do anything.

38:30.250 --> 38:31.166
<i>Qui va là?</i>

38:33.958 --> 38:34.916
<i>Ho!</i>

38:35.541 --> 38:37.541
<i>Oh, putain!</i>

38:42.541 --> 38:45.416
<i>Attends je vais flinguer ce fumier!</i>

38:45.916 --> 38:46.916
Kat?

38:49.541 --> 38:50.375
Kat?

38:51.875 --> 38:52.708
Run!

38:52.791 --> 38:54.250
Hey! Dirty Kraut!

38:54.958 --> 38:56.791
<i>-Rends-moi l'oie, ordure!</i>
-Run!

38:58.000 --> 38:59.166
<i>Fumier!</i>

39:16.250 --> 39:17.666
-Just right.
-I told you.

39:17.750 --> 39:18.958
Men, you are heroes.

39:19.041 --> 39:20.666
Shut the door or the others will smell it.

39:24.250 --> 39:25.083
Nice work.

39:25.166 --> 39:27.208
I don't know. How am I
supposed to remember anything?

39:27.291 --> 39:28.625
Come on, use your Prussian brain.

39:28.708 --> 39:30.375
Here. Open-eyed and long-fingered.

39:30.458 --> 39:31.833
Help me with the goose.

39:31.916 --> 39:34.875
A piece of goose from the goose.
From France to Franz.

39:34.958 --> 39:35.958
I want a wing.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.041
Do I have to share?
Then I'll take the rest.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.041
Fill up my bowl.

39:40.250 --> 39:43.416
Come here, you blind hen.
Wide-mouth frog…

39:43.500 --> 39:45.791
-Rest in peace in the drumfire.
-Ooh.

39:46.583 --> 39:47.916
Oh, God.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.625
You know I'll owe you forever for this.

39:51.083 --> 39:52.291
Mm.

40:16.416 --> 40:17.583
It's not bad, is it?

40:18.541 --> 40:19.583
Yes. Mm.

40:20.625 --> 40:22.375
-And you?
-Yes. Yes, good.

40:25.416 --> 40:26.541
It's good, Paul.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.666
Good, Kat.

40:27.750 --> 40:28.833
Life is short.

40:29.416 --> 40:33.041
-Where's Emil when you need him?
-Emil, bring in coffee and caviar!

40:33.125 --> 40:36.083
Yes, and draw my foot bath as well.
I need a foot bath.

40:37.875 --> 40:39.750
-Kat?
-What is it?

40:47.583 --> 40:49.750
-The farmer! The farmer!
-The farmer! Yes!

41:21.791 --> 41:23.416
Tjaden sits very quietly and says…

41:23.500 --> 41:26.208
"Where is he?"
"Cross." I keep hearing, "Cross."

41:26.291 --> 41:28.333
"My father was leader of Nazareth."

41:28.875 --> 41:31.416
"Leader of Nazareth?"
enquires the teacher.

41:31.500 --> 41:33.041
"What?" "Never heard of it."

41:33.125 --> 41:35.083
"Tjaden, go back home
and ask again, will you?"

41:35.583 --> 41:38.875
Next morning, Tjaden springs into school
and says to everybody,

41:38.958 --> 41:42.166
"Please forgive me."
"My father wasn't the leader of Nazareth."

41:42.708 --> 41:44.375
"My father was last seen with Nadja Roth."

41:48.333 --> 41:49.375
Brilliant.

41:55.708 --> 41:56.541
Look.

41:57.083 --> 41:57.916
Mhm?

42:15.916 --> 42:17.875
<i>Regarder! </i>

42:20.666 --> 42:21.833
Hey! Hello!

42:23.125 --> 42:24.166
Come here!

42:25.000 --> 42:26.333
Fresh baguette!

42:27.250 --> 42:28.125
For you!

42:28.791 --> 42:30.208
Liverwurst, love!

42:30.708 --> 42:31.875
Lots of love!

42:46.291 --> 42:47.875
Franz. What are you doing?

42:49.125 --> 42:52.333
-Take me with you.
-Come on!

42:57.416 --> 42:58.833
I'd go over.

43:00.083 --> 43:01.541
But he's making a fool of himself.

43:02.708 --> 43:05.541
Oh, my.
You are very beautiful, my love.

43:07.333 --> 43:08.208
Franz!

43:08.291 --> 43:10.166
The dark-haired beauty
is for me!

43:20.166 --> 43:21.375
What is he doing?

43:27.166 --> 43:28.000
Franz!

43:29.666 --> 43:31.041
Goodbye!

43:31.666 --> 43:33.708
Goodbye, my friends!

43:44.291 --> 43:45.375
Damn it.

43:47.541 --> 43:50.500
If it was all over,
you know what I'd be doing?

43:50.583 --> 43:52.291
There's no peace,
so it doesn't matter.

43:52.375 --> 43:53.541
No, but if there was…

43:54.250 --> 43:57.208
-We'd be surrounded by women again.
-Yeah, that's true.

43:58.250 --> 44:00.541
I wouldn't put trousers on
for eight days.

44:00.625 --> 44:03.833
I should really be spanking your backside
for talking about something like that.

44:03.916 --> 44:05.000
What about you, Paul?

44:06.458 --> 44:09.666
-No idea. Can't think.
-I'd stay with the Prussians.

44:10.208 --> 44:11.500
You're an idiot, Tjaden.

44:12.208 --> 44:13.916
Have you ever done
any peat digging?

44:14.000 --> 44:15.125
Try it sometime.

44:15.208 --> 44:17.500
Can't be worse
than digging trenches in Champagne.

44:17.583 --> 44:19.541
It takes longer
than digging trenches in Champagne.

44:19.625 --> 44:21.250
And you can't get away with not doing it.

44:21.875 --> 44:24.500
In peacetime military life,
you have no concerns.

44:25.041 --> 44:27.541
Mornings, food's there
or else you're not there.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.000
And then you have the softest bed.

44:30.083 --> 44:31.875
Every week with fresh sheets over it.

44:31.958 --> 44:32.791
And then…

44:34.500 --> 44:36.083
And before you know it, I'm a corporal.

44:37.083 --> 44:40.166
Imagine that.
Me becoming a military policeman.

44:40.250 --> 44:42.083
A Cognac here, a pint there.

44:42.166 --> 44:45.250
A military policeman
is everyone's good friend. Everyone.

44:45.333 --> 44:46.916
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

44:48.375 --> 44:49.416
What's that?

44:49.500 --> 44:51.666
You'll never be a corporal though,
will you?

45:01.416 --> 45:03.416
You always make such useless comments.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.125
What does it matter what you think anyway?

45:21.333 --> 45:23.000
-Kat! Kat!
-Here!

45:23.083 --> 45:24.125
-Kat!
-Here!

45:24.208 --> 45:25.125
Kat!

46:21.458 --> 46:22.333
"Darling one."

46:23.333 --> 46:25.291
"You asked us
for a package of food to be sent."

46:26.083 --> 46:28.458
"Four portions of sausage
are on their way with lard."

46:30.875 --> 46:33.125
"A couple of pieces of cake."

46:34.208 --> 46:36.000
"Sauerkraut and smoked wurst."

46:36.958 --> 46:37.833
"Some more…"

46:39.000 --> 46:40.791
-Hing? Hingfong?
-Hingfong.

46:41.291 --> 46:42.416
"…and a cup of sugar."

46:43.625 --> 46:46.083
"Eggs and a glass of plum jam in there."

46:46.916 --> 46:49.666
"Don't eat too quickly as I don't want
to have to send more right away."

46:50.833 --> 46:52.833
"I'd keep it away
from your comrades if I were you."

46:54.416 --> 46:55.250
"My dear one."

46:56.250 --> 46:57.875
"I must also ask a question of you."

46:58.500 --> 47:00.375
"Have you started to save up any money?"

47:01.375 --> 47:03.375
"Could you send some home
would you think?"

47:04.208 --> 47:06.875
"People are saying the war
will be over soon." "Some people."

47:07.625 --> 47:09.833
"And so it would be helpful
to have some saved up."

47:10.916 --> 47:12.750
"You're probably thinking,
'What is she after?'"

47:12.833 --> 47:14.541
"'How cheeky of her to ask.'"

47:15.375 --> 47:17.333
"But I mean not to offend you."

47:17.416 --> 47:19.708
"You know me, I can never get enough."

47:20.291 --> 47:22.958
"But more, more." "I can't help it,
I always want some more."

47:23.625 --> 47:25.875
"So make sure not to fall over
before you can come home."

47:27.708 --> 47:31.000
"Karl Lemmer is in a hospital bed
somewhere in the East."

47:31.500 --> 47:32.625
"Something with his stomach."

47:33.208 --> 47:35.458
"And he was out there
for barely three weeks in total."

47:37.041 --> 47:39.500
"Can't you also be sick,
with your rheumatism?"

47:40.958 --> 47:42.750
"You've already played your role."

47:44.125 --> 47:47.291
If only she could see
how you're sitting there, with your cigar.

47:51.375 --> 47:53.083
"This Sunday, I'll visit the gra…"

47:59.750 --> 48:02.291
"This Sunday,
I'll visit the grave of our boy."

48:05.708 --> 48:08.791
"I'll make sure to read to him
as you remember he loved that."

48:10.875 --> 48:14.375
"By next year, we'll be able to celebrate
his tenth birthday together."

48:17.208 --> 48:18.833
"That's all I have to tell you this time."

48:19.583 --> 48:21.833
"Sending kisses from your wife, for you."

48:22.541 --> 48:23.458
"<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>."

48:30.000 --> 48:30.916
I had no idea.

48:40.333 --> 48:41.666
Oh, Paul.

48:46.750 --> 48:48.375
How is all this going to work out, hmm?

48:50.291 --> 48:51.666
Returning to a home,

48:53.000 --> 48:54.916
having to go back to our normal being.

48:55.916 --> 48:59.125
Where all everyone wants to know about
are the battles we've been in.

49:01.958 --> 49:05.291
We'll be like travellers
who belong in another country elsewhere.

49:08.416 --> 49:09.666
Sometimes I wonder…

49:10.708 --> 49:11.708
Would…

49:11.791 --> 49:15.166
Would I be happier with you here at camp?

49:15.250 --> 49:17.000
Tjaden and Kropp.

49:18.208 --> 49:20.083
And with Müller. He'd be sat with us.

49:21.791 --> 49:23.333
And be eating fried potatoes.

49:24.125 --> 49:25.083
Unpeeled.

49:32.083 --> 49:33.125
Well…

49:44.916 --> 49:46.041
That's enough of that.

49:48.875 --> 49:51.208
How long until we finally get going again?

49:51.958 --> 49:54.833
How long
until we finally get going again?

50:13.375 --> 50:14.250
Franz?

50:15.000 --> 50:15.833
Yes?

50:17.500 --> 50:19.250
Tomorrow, we're up at six o'clock.

50:19.333 --> 50:20.875
To look for some children.

50:21.708 --> 50:22.625
What happened?

50:24.291 --> 50:25.833
They should have arrived today.

50:26.333 --> 50:27.375
A whole company.

50:32.250 --> 50:33.083
How was it?

50:37.375 --> 50:38.666
-Good.
-Yeah?

50:39.416 --> 50:40.250
Yes.

50:42.708 --> 50:43.541
Here.

50:48.958 --> 50:49.833
Have a smell.

51:02.416 --> 51:03.750
What's her name?

51:03.833 --> 51:04.833
Eloise.

51:07.583 --> 51:08.500
Eloise.

51:09.541 --> 51:12.708
She had skin as white as milk.

51:15.333 --> 51:16.666
Breasts…

51:18.250 --> 51:19.500
-Hey.
-Huh?

51:20.083 --> 51:21.333
I want to smell it too.

51:25.208 --> 51:26.208
Kropp, let me have it.

51:27.041 --> 51:28.791
-Here.
-Oh, my.

51:28.875 --> 51:29.750
Give it to me.

51:29.833 --> 51:32.708
A girl like that
never has dirt under her nails.

51:32.791 --> 51:35.083
-No.
-At worst, some sand from the seashore.

51:35.750 --> 51:36.958
Tjaden.

51:37.041 --> 51:39.583
-Come on, pass it here.
-I bet she bathes twice a day.

51:43.875 --> 51:46.166
Tjaden, give it back to me.

52:01.416 --> 52:02.250
Sir.

52:10.708 --> 52:11.875
Call the others.

52:50.750 --> 52:52.333
There must have been a huge explosion.

52:53.458 --> 52:54.875
Mine thrower cannons.

52:55.541 --> 52:57.666
He's been blasted
right out of his uniform.

53:03.083 --> 53:04.625
Was he one of those we've come here for?

53:05.250 --> 53:07.583
No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

53:08.583 --> 53:10.375
He's been hanging there
for some time.

53:11.208 --> 53:12.125
Not pleasant.

53:12.958 --> 53:14.375
Don't get soft now, men.

53:15.041 --> 53:16.416
How many are we looking for?

53:16.500 --> 53:18.041
Sixty young recruits.

53:25.541 --> 53:26.958
Breakfast is turnip bread.

53:27.458 --> 53:28.916
Same at lunchtime, it's turnip bread.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.583
I'm surrounded by turnip bread.
I can't face it any more.

53:32.208 --> 53:34.958
Let me know when you find them.
I'm not going any further.

53:35.875 --> 53:36.750
Gas.

53:40.041 --> 53:41.083
There was gas here.

54:23.750 --> 54:25.000
Shit!

55:00.666 --> 55:01.666
Hello, madam.

55:05.291 --> 55:06.291
I'm Kropp.

55:10.791 --> 55:11.708
And you?

55:18.583 --> 55:19.458
Mm.

55:24.083 --> 55:24.916
Do you want to…

55:29.333 --> 55:30.916
Do you want to come with me?

55:33.083 --> 55:33.916
Not a problem.

56:28.333 --> 56:29.250
Kat?

56:32.083 --> 56:33.000
Kat.

56:34.750 --> 56:35.583
Kat!

56:45.583 --> 56:46.583
Shit.

56:52.666 --> 56:54.666
-Flipping idiots.
-Uh huh.

56:55.541 --> 56:58.208
Stupid boys.
They took their masks off too soon.

57:01.625 --> 57:03.166
Germany will soon be empty.

57:20.666 --> 57:24.791
COMPIÈGNE, FRANCE
8 NOVEMBER, 1918

58:26.375 --> 58:27.208
General.

58:29.708 --> 58:31.333
Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

58:31.416 --> 58:33.041
The French are increasing the pressure.

58:33.125 --> 58:35.833
Early this morning,
our reconnaissance intercepted orders

58:35.916 --> 58:38.250
summoning entire divisions to Latierre.

58:38.333 --> 58:41.083
A tank fleet is still reportedly
still stuck at Fernancourt.

58:41.166 --> 58:42.875
Must mean an attack is likely.

58:44.375 --> 58:47.416
The social democrats
will be the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

58:49.958 --> 58:50.875
General?

58:55.416 --> 58:58.333
I have just put a German delegation
to the armistice negotiations

58:58.416 --> 58:59.916
on the train to Compiègne.

59:07.041 --> 59:10.500
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling out our fatherland.

59:11.916 --> 59:13.583
My orders are war.

59:14.791 --> 59:18.333
And all the while that is the case,
I shall fight for every meter.

59:20.666 --> 59:23.083
We have to hold on now
and wait for fresh troops.

59:23.166 --> 59:25.916
In a few months, the incoming class
of recruits will be here.

59:27.125 --> 59:28.958
The French are trying everything they can

59:29.041 --> 59:31.583
to force
their completely unacceptable terms on us.

59:34.208 --> 59:35.875
I will not capitulate.

59:38.750 --> 59:41.666
We must strike without delay.
With all our might.

59:47.000 --> 59:47.916
General.

1:00:10.250 --> 1:00:11.500
From our position,

1:00:13.333 --> 1:00:14.791
I have to be clear…

1:00:15.916 --> 1:00:17.333
We all have to be clear…

1:00:18.791 --> 1:00:19.875
For God's sake.

1:00:20.458 --> 1:00:21.375
Shit.

1:00:53.875 --> 1:00:54.708
Sir!

1:01:05.458 --> 1:01:07.125
Soldiers, pack your bags,

1:01:07.208 --> 1:01:09.958
roll up your bedding,
and wash your mess kits.

1:01:10.041 --> 1:01:13.333
The whole regiment will advance
to the front firing position.

1:01:13.416 --> 1:01:16.583
And I mean everyone
who's able to stand on two legs is going.

1:01:17.750 --> 1:01:19.791
Line up, for God's sake.

1:01:20.375 --> 1:01:23.583
You think the Frenchies will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

1:01:23.666 --> 1:01:25.333
-Here we go again.
-Get moving!

1:01:25.416 --> 1:01:28.041
-Where to?
-Where to? Where to?

1:01:28.541 --> 1:01:29.541
Into battle.

1:03:04.791 --> 1:03:06.666
Monsieur le Maréchal is awaiting you.

1:04:14.375 --> 1:04:15.541
I'll come back for you.

1:04:31.083 --> 1:04:32.166
Envious, huh?

1:04:50.291 --> 1:04:51.541
I stand before you

1:04:52.083 --> 1:04:56.000
in the hope that you will take
our presence here today as an opportunity

1:04:56.083 --> 1:04:58.750
to take action to suspend all hostilities.

1:05:00.208 --> 1:05:01.750
In the name of humanity,

1:05:02.541 --> 1:05:05.541
I'm here asking you for an agreement
to an immediate cease-fire

1:05:05.625 --> 1:05:08.708
for the entire duration
of our negotiating time

1:05:08.791 --> 1:05:12.166
in order to spare
our nation's unnecessary depletion.

1:05:14.166 --> 1:05:17.416
Matthias Erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

1:05:27.333 --> 1:05:29.250
Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

1:05:30.166 --> 1:05:31.666
I don't know.

1:05:31.750 --> 1:05:34.625
Marshal Foch asks
what brings you gentlemen to him.

1:05:38.625 --> 1:05:40.666
We are here looking forward to hearing

1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:44.250
your proposal for an enduring cease-fire

1:05:44.333 --> 1:05:47.458
that will include all those on the water,
on land, as well as in the sky.

1:05:51.625 --> 1:05:53.666
I have no proposal
of this kind to make.

1:05:56.708 --> 1:05:57.791
What does he mean by that?

1:05:58.625 --> 1:06:01.791
I think he disliked the phrasing
of what you said.

1:06:03.333 --> 1:06:04.250
Yes.

1:06:04.750 --> 1:06:05.958
Good, then…

1:06:09.541 --> 1:06:10.625
Monsieur Le Maréchal,

1:06:10.708 --> 1:06:14.375
If you please,
we would like to know the conditions--

1:06:23.416 --> 1:06:25.500
He wants you
to ask for it, formally.

1:06:33.083 --> 1:06:34.375
Monsieur le Maréchal,

1:06:36.750 --> 1:06:38.708
I am asking you for an armistice.

1:06:40.458 --> 1:06:43.041
We are asking
for an armistice.

1:06:48.666 --> 1:06:50.791
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

1:06:50.875 --> 1:06:53.000
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

1:06:53.083 --> 1:06:55.000
They are non-negotiable.

1:06:55.083 --> 1:06:56.458
Seventy-two hours?

1:06:56.541 --> 1:06:58.166
The war will continue until you sign them.

1:06:58.250 --> 1:06:59.333
Monsieur le Maréchal,

1:06:59.833 --> 1:07:03.125
in God's name,
don't let 72 hours pass us by here.

1:07:04.625 --> 1:07:07.000
Thousands of lives depend on it.

1:07:12.958 --> 1:07:13.958
Sign then.

1:07:29.916 --> 1:07:30.875
Understood.

1:07:49.958 --> 1:07:51.583
-Soldiers, we'll march.
-Sir.

1:07:54.916 --> 1:07:56.041
Soldiers, march.

1:07:57.333 --> 1:07:58.333
March, soldiers.

1:08:01.333 --> 1:08:02.416
Soldiers, march.

1:08:03.875 --> 1:08:05.166
Off you go, get out of here.

1:08:06.291 --> 1:08:07.250
March, soldiers.

1:08:08.916 --> 1:08:09.791
March.

1:08:10.833 --> 1:08:11.791
Soldiers, march.

1:08:13.333 --> 1:08:14.958
March, soldiers. Off you go.

1:09:04.958 --> 1:09:06.250
Go, go, go!

1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.666
<i>Atención aux arbalètes…</i>

1:10:00.916 --> 1:10:02.750
<i>Allez! Allez les gars!</i>

1:10:04.250 --> 1:10:05.208
<i>Allez! Allez!</i>

1:10:35.375 --> 1:10:38.208
Keep going, Paul. Come on. Paul!

1:10:45.666 --> 1:10:46.625
<i>Allez!</i>

1:10:55.208 --> 1:10:56.791
<i>Au renfort!</i>

1:11:15.125 --> 1:11:16.500
<i>Putain, putain, non, non!</i>

1:12:01.416 --> 1:12:02.333
Get out!

1:12:08.041 --> 1:12:09.250
What is that?

1:12:10.416 --> 1:12:11.250
Get out!

1:12:13.166 --> 1:12:15.250
-Here!
-Quick, quick, quick! Move it!

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:16.541
Get out!

1:12:16.625 --> 1:12:17.458
There, there, look!

1:12:17.541 --> 1:12:18.541
-What is it?
-Down there.

1:12:18.625 --> 1:12:19.458
What is it?

1:12:53.916 --> 1:12:55.291
Open fire!

1:12:56.083 --> 1:12:57.916
Open fire!

1:13:39.583 --> 1:13:41.166
All down!

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:42.375
Get down!

1:14:07.791 --> 1:14:09.833
Boys, think fast! Be smart!

1:14:32.458 --> 1:14:33.708
Get the hand grenades out!

1:14:34.541 --> 1:14:36.916
Throw them in the vehicle
when they're on top of us.

1:15:04.333 --> 1:15:05.166
Get out!

1:15:06.083 --> 1:15:07.125
Get up!

1:15:15.666 --> 1:15:16.500
Franz!

1:15:16.583 --> 1:15:18.083
Follow me. Come on, follow me!

1:15:20.208 --> 1:15:21.083
Franz!

1:15:22.208 --> 1:15:23.291
Paul!

1:16:07.416 --> 1:16:08.625
Paul.

1:16:08.708 --> 1:16:09.708
Paul!

1:16:25.541 --> 1:16:26.750
Open fire!

1:16:40.166 --> 1:16:41.583
Retreat!

1:16:42.833 --> 1:16:43.916
Retreat!

1:17:59.625 --> 1:18:02.250
No, no, no! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No!

1:18:02.333 --> 1:18:05.125
Please, please, no! No, no, no!

1:18:05.208 --> 1:18:08.250
No, wait, wait, don't shoot.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. No.

1:18:08.333 --> 1:18:09.250
-No, no!
-Albert.

1:18:17.583 --> 1:18:19.708
Come on, come on.

1:18:19.791 --> 1:18:21.166
Come on!

1:18:26.875 --> 1:18:27.833
Keep going!

1:18:54.083 --> 1:18:55.333
Where is Franz?

1:18:55.416 --> 1:18:56.666
I've left Franz alone!

1:19:04.166 --> 1:19:05.291
Katczinsky!

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:07.750
Take the machine gun and retreat.

1:19:07.833 --> 1:19:10.583
We'll regroup in Eguisac,
two kilometres northeast.

1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.666
I miss my comrades, sir. I miss them all!

1:19:16.250 --> 1:19:18.041
I miss my mother, for God's sake.

1:19:18.125 --> 1:19:20.666
Grenades, ammunition! Come on!

1:19:22.541 --> 1:19:23.666
Paul, come on!

1:19:31.916 --> 1:19:33.875
Get out of here! Let's go!

1:19:51.625 --> 1:19:54.250
These aren't negotiations,
this is a dictate.

1:19:54.333 --> 1:19:57.666
Maybe we should return to Spa
to consult with the general staff.

1:19:57.750 --> 1:19:59.708
And what expectations
do you have for that?

1:19:59.791 --> 1:20:02.166
Even if we end up
losing definitively after all,

1:20:02.250 --> 1:20:04.583
we won't be worse off
than we are with this surrender.

1:20:04.666 --> 1:20:06.666
Except for
a few hundred thousand extra deaths.

1:20:06.750 --> 1:20:08.583
Alsace-Lorraine,
occupation of the Rhineland,

1:20:08.666 --> 1:20:10.833
cannons, locomotives,
trains, and whatever else.

1:20:10.916 --> 1:20:13.041
You are aware,
this is a total capitulation.

1:20:13.125 --> 1:20:17.458
250,000 Americans
are landing each month in Europe.

1:20:17.541 --> 1:20:21.083
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai.
All of those lost.

1:20:22.125 --> 1:20:24.125
All that's left
separating us from an armistice

1:20:24.208 --> 1:20:25.791
is false pride, as I see it.

1:20:25.875 --> 1:20:27.208
Thanks to you and your commanders,

1:20:27.291 --> 1:20:29.458
we're here dealing with the mess
left by them.

1:20:29.541 --> 1:20:32.000
I'm happy for you to depart here,
it's down to you.

1:20:32.083 --> 1:20:33.208
We are remaining here.

1:20:39.666 --> 1:20:40.750
It is winter.

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:45.041
Without trains and provisions,
Bolshevism will take over.

1:20:45.875 --> 1:20:47.875
On their way home,
the men will die of hunger

1:20:47.958 --> 1:20:50.375
instead of dying
with honour on the battlefield.

1:20:51.625 --> 1:20:52.500
Honour?

1:20:54.458 --> 1:20:57.291
My son was killed in the war.
He doesn't feel any honour.

1:21:03.583 --> 1:21:04.708
Von Helldorf.

1:21:05.708 --> 1:21:08.125
Please get a few copies
of the conditions of their proposal

1:21:08.208 --> 1:21:10.375
and telegraph them to headquarters.

1:21:10.458 --> 1:21:11.791
You inform the government.

1:21:15.291 --> 1:21:17.333
We have 72 hours left here, gentlemen,

1:21:17.416 --> 1:21:19.750
and during every minute
we waste by talking about it,

1:21:19.833 --> 1:21:21.291
there dies another soldier.

1:21:22.208 --> 1:21:25.666
Let us gain mercy where we can,
but for God's sake,

1:21:26.500 --> 1:21:27.583
let's make peace.

1:22:12.916 --> 1:22:15.250
Retreat! Retreat!

1:22:20.250 --> 1:22:22.333
Run! Run!

1:22:22.833 --> 1:22:25.083
Keep firing!

1:23:24.083 --> 1:23:25.125
Shut up!

1:24:09.458 --> 1:24:10.458
Shut up!

1:24:13.666 --> 1:24:14.791
That's enough!

1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:11.708
No, no, no.

1:26:12.333 --> 1:26:13.166
Comrade.

1:26:14.250 --> 1:26:16.208
Comrade, comrade.

1:27:18.625 --> 1:27:19.541
So sorry.

1:27:20.958 --> 1:27:22.041
So sorry.

1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.208
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

1:28:02.750 --> 1:28:05.291
DUVAL, GÉRARD
TYPOGRAPHER

1:28:19.916 --> 1:28:20.875
Your wife…

1:28:22.875 --> 1:28:24.000
Your wife…

1:28:25.625 --> 1:28:27.291
I promise… I promise…

1:28:28.708 --> 1:28:29.666
I promise…

1:30:17.500 --> 1:30:19.125
When were you born, Brixdorf?

1:30:21.416 --> 1:30:23.291
1877, in June.

1:30:25.291 --> 1:30:26.708
A summer child.

1:30:27.791 --> 1:30:28.625
Yes.

1:30:31.875 --> 1:30:33.083
What about your father?

1:30:35.375 --> 1:30:37.625
My family live in Holstein
and he has a factory there.

1:30:38.166 --> 1:30:40.541
Producing what?

1:30:42.416 --> 1:30:43.708
Riding saddles, general.

1:30:44.208 --> 1:30:45.375
Riding saddles.

1:30:47.083 --> 1:30:50.458
Something that will always sell.
Your future is secure then.

1:30:52.125 --> 1:30:53.458
I am indeed fortunate.

1:30:55.833 --> 1:30:56.708
And?

1:30:57.666 --> 1:30:59.250
Are you looking forward to going home?

1:31:00.541 --> 1:31:02.916
-When we are no longer needed here?
-Yes.

1:31:04.583 --> 1:31:07.750
After the war,
a position of responsibility awaits me.

1:31:08.583 --> 1:31:10.666
-I will take over the business.
-Mhm.

1:31:11.833 --> 1:31:12.958
Congratulations.

1:31:13.583 --> 1:31:14.500
And you?

1:31:16.916 --> 1:31:18.000
I'm a soldier.

1:31:19.833 --> 1:31:22.083
My father was an officer in this regiment.

1:31:23.333 --> 1:31:25.541
He fought in the three wars
under Bismarck.

1:31:26.250 --> 1:31:27.708
He won all three of them.

1:31:28.291 --> 1:31:30.583
In 1871, he marched on Paris

1:31:31.250 --> 1:31:33.083
and when he returned, he was a hero.

1:31:36.916 --> 1:31:39.125
I was too late in being born, Brixdorf.

1:31:40.791 --> 1:31:42.750
It's been 50 years of no war.

1:31:44.166 --> 1:31:45.708
What is a soldier without war?

1:31:52.875 --> 1:31:54.500
Were you and your father close?

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.458
As a child, maybe.

1:31:59.708 --> 1:32:01.875
A man is alone when born.

1:32:02.500 --> 1:32:03.583
He lives alone

1:32:04.666 --> 1:32:06.208
and on his deathbed is alone.

1:32:36.166 --> 1:32:37.291
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

1:32:37.375 --> 1:32:39.000
Come in.

1:32:40.375 --> 1:32:43.500
-Von Helldorf. How can I help you?
-Hindenburg.

1:32:43.583 --> 1:32:44.875
Open it immediately.

1:32:51.416 --> 1:32:52.791
He urges us to sign.

1:32:56.291 --> 1:32:58.541
-It's over!
-We're going home!

1:32:58.625 --> 1:33:00.833
We're going home!

1:33:01.416 --> 1:33:03.083
Back to our families.

1:33:11.458 --> 1:33:15.958
In the name of all
who are living in a world of sin.

1:33:16.041 --> 1:33:19.666
We are surrounded by it now in the filth.

1:33:21.916 --> 1:33:23.250
Knock on the monastery's door

1:33:23.333 --> 1:33:26.500
and you'll find
only thieves and scoundrels.

1:33:26.583 --> 1:33:29.375
It's finally over.
The fat pigs finally get it.

1:33:29.458 --> 1:33:33.625
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, do you hear that?

1:33:38.333 --> 1:33:39.916
Are there any sergeants left?

1:33:49.166 --> 1:33:51.250
Chloroform the man,
for God's sake.

1:34:05.541 --> 1:34:06.458
Bäumer.

1:34:07.625 --> 1:34:08.458
Bäumer.

1:34:13.750 --> 1:34:14.833
Bäumer.

1:34:14.916 --> 1:34:16.541
Tjaden? Tjaden.

1:34:18.791 --> 1:34:19.791
What happened?

1:34:20.458 --> 1:34:21.458
Where have you been hit?

1:34:21.541 --> 1:34:22.625
Above the knee.

1:34:23.875 --> 1:34:25.333
Or somewhere down there.

1:34:25.416 --> 1:34:26.791
I can't feel anything.

1:34:27.708 --> 1:34:29.291
How far up is the shot?

1:34:30.333 --> 1:34:31.666
I can't raise my head.

1:34:33.666 --> 1:34:35.125
Ten centimetres, it seems.

1:34:39.875 --> 1:34:41.083
You're going home soon, Tjaden.

1:34:41.166 --> 1:34:43.125
-You think so?
-Yes, you are.

1:34:47.833 --> 1:34:50.166
It's unlikely the police force
will have me, though.

1:34:52.166 --> 1:34:53.291
God damn shit.

1:34:54.500 --> 1:34:55.875
You can still do it.

1:34:58.041 --> 1:34:59.166
Just wait and see.

1:34:59.958 --> 1:35:01.875
I'm not going to let them amputate me.

1:35:03.291 --> 1:35:05.250
I'm not living as a cripple in this world.

1:35:05.791 --> 1:35:07.041
You won't have to.

1:35:07.125 --> 1:35:09.375
There are others who are worse off
that they've patched up.

1:35:13.750 --> 1:35:15.250
Oh, dear Paul.

1:35:15.958 --> 1:35:17.416
I have something to give you.

1:35:49.333 --> 1:35:50.291
Is he dead?

1:35:56.083 --> 1:35:57.708
You must show braveness.

1:35:59.375 --> 1:36:00.625
You're alive, remember?

1:36:00.708 --> 1:36:02.541
For that, you have to be grateful.

1:36:03.375 --> 1:36:04.375
For us.

1:36:04.458 --> 1:36:06.750
-For those who didn't make it.
-That's enough.

1:36:06.833 --> 1:36:09.333
Look here. You mustn't say that. Not you.

1:36:24.791 --> 1:36:26.083
Good feeling, right?

1:36:27.291 --> 1:36:28.375
Have a bit of that, then.

1:36:28.958 --> 1:36:30.666
Yeah,
dry your socks out there.

1:36:31.166 --> 1:36:32.750
The way the last summer was…

1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:38.583
Right, none…

1:36:40.791 --> 1:36:41.875
You see?

1:36:41.958 --> 1:36:43.375
Not like the last one.

1:36:44.750 --> 1:36:46.500
That was too…

1:36:49.791 --> 1:36:51.583
You always blame me.

1:36:51.666 --> 1:36:54.500
-We saw you!
--What did you see me doing?

1:36:55.625 --> 1:36:56.666
Come on!

1:36:57.791 --> 1:36:59.166
Nah, we know it was you.

1:36:59.250 --> 1:37:00.875
Why is it always on me?

1:37:15.500 --> 1:37:17.916
Do you have shit for brains?
Why won't you listen?

1:37:18.458 --> 1:37:20.583
You have been given
a second company's provisions.

1:37:21.208 --> 1:37:23.791
We are that second company!

1:37:23.875 --> 1:37:25.958
So dish it out! Give it to us!

1:37:26.041 --> 1:37:26.958
Kat?

1:37:27.750 --> 1:37:28.916
-Kat!
-Paul?

1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:29.833
Kat!

1:37:30.708 --> 1:37:31.625
Paul!

1:37:32.208 --> 1:37:33.833
-Paul!
-Kat, you were alive.

1:37:33.916 --> 1:37:35.541
-Paul!
-You're alive!

1:37:35.625 --> 1:37:36.541
Paul.

1:37:44.875 --> 1:37:46.125
Tjaden was hit.

1:37:46.208 --> 1:37:47.500
He's lying inside the church.

1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:50.666
He'll get a double portion from us.

1:37:50.750 --> 1:37:51.625
Yes.

1:37:56.125 --> 1:37:57.791
Another one. In here.

1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:03.583
-I thought you were dead.
-Ha!

1:38:04.541 --> 1:38:05.916
At some point, we'll all die.

1:38:06.958 --> 1:38:08.333
But not on the home stretch.

1:38:10.625 --> 1:38:12.333
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

1:38:13.750 --> 1:38:15.583
Ha!

1:38:18.833 --> 1:38:19.666
Tjaden.

1:38:21.791 --> 1:38:22.708
Tjaden.

1:38:26.916 --> 1:38:27.750
Yes.

1:38:28.541 --> 1:38:29.750
-Kat?
-Yes.

1:38:34.083 --> 1:38:35.833
Kat.

1:38:35.916 --> 1:38:37.416
I've soup here for you.

1:38:37.500 --> 1:38:38.916
Have you brought cutlery?

1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.125
Yes, we brought cutlery as well.

1:38:46.500 --> 1:38:47.916
There you go. Eat up.

1:39:12.333 --> 1:39:14.833
Stop, stop, Tjaden, Tjaden!

1:39:15.333 --> 1:39:16.333
Stop!

1:39:20.416 --> 1:39:21.625
We need help over here!

1:39:22.875 --> 1:39:24.291
What made you do that?

1:39:24.375 --> 1:39:25.291
Why would you?

1:39:26.208 --> 1:39:27.958
It's over for me.

1:39:28.041 --> 1:39:29.416
He's bleeding out!

1:39:34.375 --> 1:39:35.250
Tjaden.

1:39:40.416 --> 1:39:41.291
Tjaden.

1:41:15.875 --> 1:41:16.791
What is it?

1:41:19.041 --> 1:41:20.125
I've lost something.

1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:26.375
Kat, do you speak French?

1:41:27.041 --> 1:41:29.291
Mm.
<i>S'il vous plaît. S'il vous plaît.</i>

1:41:33.583 --> 1:41:35.666
My mother always said
it was French I should learn.

1:41:35.750 --> 1:41:36.625
Aha.

1:41:40.041 --> 1:41:41.000
And the piano.

1:41:43.541 --> 1:41:45.083
She also warned me of war.

1:41:45.583 --> 1:41:46.708
She didn't want me to go.

1:41:46.791 --> 1:41:49.666
"That's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

1:41:52.083 --> 1:41:53.708
I wanted to show that I could do it.

1:41:54.708 --> 1:41:56.125
What use is that now?

1:41:59.708 --> 1:42:01.583
"A couple of weeks, we'll be in Paris."

1:42:04.333 --> 1:42:07.375
These past two years of grenades
can't be shed like an item of clothing.

1:42:07.458 --> 1:42:10.125
-Paul.
-The stench will remain on us forever.

1:42:10.208 --> 1:42:12.125
-Enough.
-Ludwig is dead. Franz is dead. Albert--

1:42:12.208 --> 1:42:13.541
Is that to do with us?

1:42:14.750 --> 1:42:16.333
They don't suffer any more.

1:42:16.833 --> 1:42:17.791
Peace for them.

1:42:19.958 --> 1:42:21.458
We're still alive.

1:42:25.875 --> 1:42:27.541
Everything here is like a fever.

1:42:28.291 --> 1:42:30.416
Not one person wants it
but suddenly it's there.

1:42:31.625 --> 1:42:33.791
We didn't ask for it.
The others didn't ask for it.

1:42:33.875 --> 1:42:35.083
But nonetheless it happened

1:42:35.166 --> 1:42:37.166
and nonetheless half the world
is involved, mind you.

1:42:37.250 --> 1:42:38.375
God looks down

1:42:39.791 --> 1:42:41.083
at us murderers.

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:46.500
Yeah, well.

1:42:50.250 --> 1:42:51.375
But what do I know?

1:42:51.958 --> 1:42:52.875
Nothing.

1:42:53.666 --> 1:42:55.208
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

1:42:57.458 --> 1:42:59.416
Get some rest. We're the lucky ones.

1:42:59.916 --> 1:43:00.750
Yes.

1:43:18.791 --> 1:43:19.666
Kat?

1:43:20.625 --> 1:43:21.708
Mm.

1:43:23.833 --> 1:43:25.166
What did your son die of?

1:43:30.583 --> 1:43:31.416
The pox.

1:43:40.041 --> 1:43:41.708
I'm afraid of what's to come.

1:43:49.083 --> 1:43:50.000
Don't be.

1:44:22.208 --> 1:44:23.125
Henri.

1:44:26.708 --> 1:44:27.833
Taste it.

1:44:31.833 --> 1:44:32.916
Were they made today?

1:44:35.916 --> 1:44:37.875
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

1:44:38.875 --> 1:44:39.708
Hmm.

1:45:02.291 --> 1:45:03.458
Monsieur le Maréchal.

1:45:10.875 --> 1:45:12.000
I'm listening.

1:45:12.083 --> 1:45:14.041
The Kaiser
has abdicated.

1:45:14.125 --> 1:45:18.666
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

1:45:18.750 --> 1:45:21.250
The new government
will do everything it can

1:45:21.333 --> 1:45:23.875
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

1:45:23.958 --> 1:45:27.708
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

1:45:28.375 --> 1:45:30.750
faces hunger and anarchy setting in.

1:45:30.833 --> 1:45:34.041
This is a disease
of the defeated, not of the victorious.

1:45:34.125 --> 1:45:35.500
I don't fear it.

1:45:35.583 --> 1:45:37.208
I reject any compromise.

1:45:37.291 --> 1:45:38.875
I reject any compromise.

1:45:38.958 --> 1:45:41.041
Monsieur le Maréchal, please.

1:45:42.250 --> 1:45:45.500
Be fair to your opponent
or else this peace will be hated.

1:45:45.583 --> 1:45:46.541
Fair?

1:45:49.875 --> 1:45:51.458
You speak of fairness?

1:46:05.625 --> 1:46:06.750
Sign it.

1:47:11.250 --> 1:47:12.666
Let the minutes record.

1:47:14.291 --> 1:47:18.083
The armistice here signed
shall take effect in six hours from now

1:47:18.166 --> 1:47:21.916
at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day
of the eleventh month.

1:47:24.375 --> 1:47:25.666
Very good.

1:47:26.291 --> 1:47:27.416
The war is over.

1:47:41.583 --> 1:47:43.583
What are you going to do now?

1:47:45.416 --> 1:47:47.000
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

1:47:49.250 --> 1:47:51.041
The plains of Latierre, general.

1:47:51.125 --> 1:47:52.000
Eguisac.

1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.250
I see them too.

1:47:55.458 --> 1:47:58.166
But also German soldiers
running away like cowards.

1:48:00.041 --> 1:48:02.333
The French troops are farting
on our position in Latierre

1:48:02.416 --> 1:48:04.958
and outside there's a train
crammed full of horse fuckers

1:48:05.041 --> 1:48:06.333
who are selling the homeland off.

1:48:10.541 --> 1:48:12.458
See to it that all recruits are withdrawn.

1:48:13.750 --> 1:48:15.083
Have them all report here.

1:48:15.750 --> 1:48:18.291
We're going to sort out this pile of shit!

1:48:29.083 --> 1:48:33.416
<i>Any communication</i>
<i>with the enemy remains prohibited.</i>

1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:38.416
<i>Firstly, hostilities on the entire front</i>
<i>will be ceased this morning,</i>

1:48:38.500 --> 1:48:40.666
<i>November 11th at eleven o'clock.</i>

1:48:41.416 --> 1:48:44.083
<i>Secondly, the troops</i>
<i>will not cross the line reached</i>

1:48:44.166 --> 1:48:46.291
<i>on this day at this hour.</i>

1:48:46.375 --> 1:48:50.500
<i>The front line</i>
<i>shall remain unchanged past this hour.</i>

1:48:50.583 --> 1:48:53.625
<i>All troops are to return to their station.</i>

1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:55.541
What time is it?

1:49:01.416 --> 1:49:03.416
-Why aren't you asleep?
-Listen a minute.

1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:08.125
It's so still.

1:49:10.666 --> 1:49:12.041
I must be going deaf.

1:49:18.416 --> 1:49:19.791
They've signed, Paul.

1:49:24.541 --> 1:49:25.583
The war's over.

1:49:27.541 --> 1:49:28.500
It's over.

1:49:34.250 --> 1:49:35.250
Are you hungry?

1:49:36.208 --> 1:49:37.375
I'm hungry.

1:49:42.375 --> 1:49:43.791
Where are you going?

1:49:43.875 --> 1:49:46.000
Come on,
before the bastard wakes up.

1:49:48.125 --> 1:49:51.208
-What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
-I don't know.

1:49:51.291 --> 1:49:53.041
I'm gonna roast a goose.

1:49:53.625 --> 1:49:55.333
Red cabbage, potatoes…

1:49:55.416 --> 1:49:58.041
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

1:49:58.125 --> 1:50:00.750
My God, Paul, she is beautiful.

1:50:00.833 --> 1:50:01.875
Yeah?

1:50:01.958 --> 1:50:04.250
-What does she look like?
-Well…

1:50:04.833 --> 1:50:07.166
Long curly hair, dark.

1:50:07.833 --> 1:50:10.083
And she's buxom and strong.

1:50:10.166 --> 1:50:11.000
Yeah?

1:50:13.500 --> 1:50:14.416
Christmas.

1:50:15.250 --> 1:50:16.625
It's all so far away still.

1:50:17.166 --> 1:50:18.916
No, it's not. It's really close.

1:50:22.750 --> 1:50:25.583
We want another child. Or children, Paul.

1:50:25.666 --> 1:50:29.125
Because what is Christmas
without children? It's nothing, really.

1:50:29.208 --> 1:50:30.041
Ah?

1:50:31.875 --> 1:50:32.875
You know when…

1:50:33.666 --> 1:50:35.416
Once we're back home, then we will…

1:50:36.125 --> 1:50:38.000
-Yeah?
-We must do something together.

1:50:38.750 --> 1:50:40.791
The two of us together.
Something big, yeah?

1:50:40.875 --> 1:50:41.708
Yeah, yeah.

1:50:43.791 --> 1:50:44.666
What is it?

1:50:45.333 --> 1:50:48.000
I'm a shoemaker, Paul. I repair shoes.

1:50:48.541 --> 1:50:52.083
Ah? You know how to read, write.
You finished school.

1:50:53.083 --> 1:50:54.333
Hasn't done me any good, though.

1:50:55.541 --> 1:50:56.625
What are we gonna do?

1:50:57.333 --> 1:50:58.750
Sole shoes together?

1:50:59.500 --> 1:51:00.791
Are you trying to insult me?

1:51:02.125 --> 1:51:03.833
I can't read my wife's letters even now.

1:51:05.208 --> 1:51:06.500
You're going to university, Paul.

1:51:07.541 --> 1:51:08.875
Or I'll shoot you right here.

1:51:11.333 --> 1:51:12.458
My trousers are loose.

1:51:15.333 --> 1:51:16.541
My trousers are loose.

1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:20.875
You'll just have to eat something.

1:51:21.791 --> 1:51:24.000
Soon we'll be home
then we can eat whatever we want.

1:51:25.291 --> 1:51:26.166
Whatever we want.

1:51:51.416 --> 1:51:52.416
It's your go.

1:51:53.083 --> 1:51:55.083
If the farmer catches me again,

1:51:55.166 --> 1:51:57.041
then he's bound
to shoot me down where I stand.

1:52:01.458 --> 1:52:03.291
Just be careful of the damn dog too.

1:52:03.375 --> 1:52:04.250
Yeah.

1:52:36.291 --> 1:52:37.291
Ah?

1:52:55.708 --> 1:52:57.791
Shh, shh… Hey, hey, hey.

1:53:18.208 --> 1:53:19.166
Look.

1:53:22.208 --> 1:53:23.541
It's really good.

1:53:26.916 --> 1:53:27.750
Want some?

1:53:30.250 --> 1:53:31.166
Shit.

1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000
Piece of garbage…

1:54:22.208 --> 1:54:23.208
Stop!

1:54:24.166 --> 1:54:25.291
Thief!

1:54:33.875 --> 1:54:35.500
Kat! Run!

1:54:36.375 --> 1:54:37.375
Run!

1:54:39.250 --> 1:54:40.250
Asshole!

1:54:45.958 --> 1:54:46.791
God damn!

1:54:48.041 --> 1:54:50.041
We'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

1:55:07.291 --> 1:55:08.666
Oh, crap.

1:55:08.750 --> 1:55:10.166
-Look at this.
-What is it?

1:55:11.125 --> 1:55:13.083
-A lucky shot.
-He hit the eggs!

1:55:14.958 --> 1:55:16.041
Stop the flow.

1:55:21.500 --> 1:55:22.791
Come on, get it in there.

1:55:23.875 --> 1:55:24.916
There you go.

1:55:27.875 --> 1:55:29.208
We can have an omelette.

1:55:29.291 --> 1:55:31.416
No, we'll eat them now.

1:55:31.500 --> 1:55:32.416
They're just as good.

1:55:51.333 --> 1:55:52.416
Better than ever.

1:55:54.208 --> 1:55:55.125
I won't be long.

1:57:32.500 --> 1:57:33.416
Kat?

1:57:38.333 --> 1:57:39.500
Kat?

1:57:43.875 --> 1:57:44.750
Kat!

1:57:46.958 --> 1:57:48.000
What happened?

1:57:48.916 --> 1:57:49.750
We should leave.

1:57:51.625 --> 1:57:52.666
Who fired the shot?

1:57:53.166 --> 1:57:54.541
That little shit from the farm.

1:57:55.666 --> 1:57:56.833
The farmer's son.

1:57:58.875 --> 1:58:00.291
Kat, Kat.

1:58:01.166 --> 1:58:02.208
What a mess.

1:58:10.333 --> 1:58:11.208
How big is it?

1:58:11.708 --> 1:58:14.000
Little finger.
I'll get the bullet out.

1:58:14.083 --> 1:58:16.333
No. Give me a cigarette.

1:58:17.541 --> 1:58:18.708
Let the medic do that.

1:58:37.125 --> 1:58:39.208
They stuck me in a class
with seven-year-olds.

1:58:41.125 --> 1:58:42.750
I'd begun shaving already.

1:58:44.458 --> 1:58:45.541
Find me a word.

1:58:47.666 --> 1:58:49.208
That trifle can rhyme with.

1:58:50.375 --> 1:58:51.208
Mhm.

1:58:53.291 --> 1:58:55.583
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1:59:02.166 --> 1:59:03.541
Fucking shit.

1:59:04.958 --> 1:59:07.083
Why the hell did this have to happen now?

1:59:10.916 --> 1:59:12.541
-Come on, we need to move.
-Yeah.

1:59:19.708 --> 1:59:20.625
Alright?

1:59:21.666 --> 1:59:22.875
Kat?

1:59:22.958 --> 1:59:24.083
Rifle.

1:59:24.166 --> 1:59:25.333
Mhm?

1:59:25.416 --> 1:59:27.125
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1:59:37.083 --> 1:59:40.791
When we get home, you're going
to make a new pair of boots for me.

1:59:40.875 --> 1:59:42.708
I'm walking my feet to the bone.

1:59:57.291 --> 1:59:58.166
Hey!

2:00:01.625 --> 2:00:02.750
Wait!

2:00:04.333 --> 2:00:05.291
Pull over!

2:00:05.875 --> 2:00:06.750
Let us on!

2:00:07.916 --> 2:00:09.541
Hey! Let us on!

2:00:20.666 --> 2:00:21.750
Come on, will you?

2:00:57.250 --> 2:00:58.375
This man needs care.

2:01:00.750 --> 2:01:01.916
Where is the medic?

2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:32.708
Could've spared yourself
the trouble.

2:01:33.875 --> 2:01:34.708
Huh?

2:01:35.750 --> 2:01:36.583
He's dead.

2:01:42.166 --> 2:01:44.541
But it's… It's just a small bullet wound.

2:01:45.166 --> 2:01:47.833
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

2:01:48.375 --> 2:01:49.458
The organs are poisoned.

2:01:56.416 --> 2:01:57.416
Unconscious.

2:01:58.541 --> 2:01:59.375
No.

2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:00.958
He's dead.

2:02:01.500 --> 2:02:02.625
I know what I'm doing.

2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.791
Impossible. I was…
I was just talking to him.

2:02:08.375 --> 2:02:09.500
He's unconscious.

2:02:11.375 --> 2:02:12.458
He's unconscious.

2:02:19.875 --> 2:02:20.708
See?

2:02:22.625 --> 2:02:25.416
He simply had bad luck.
Right before the end.

2:04:14.125 --> 2:04:15.750
Go on, keep going!

2:04:15.833 --> 2:04:17.208
Keep going!

2:04:17.708 --> 2:04:19.333
Keep going, come on!

2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:29.083
This is it.

2:04:31.250 --> 2:04:32.750
I'm going to tell him I'm going home.

2:04:34.708 --> 2:04:35.708
It's over.

2:04:37.541 --> 2:04:39.208
Attention!

2:04:45.416 --> 2:04:46.375
Soldiers.

2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:49.166
We stand here as brothers

2:04:50.125 --> 2:04:51.833
in a world of enemies

2:04:51.916 --> 2:04:54.833
and are forced to watch
as German social democrats

2:04:54.916 --> 2:04:57.875
render our beloved people defenseless

2:04:59.166 --> 2:05:02.083
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

2:05:04.125 --> 2:05:05.041
Comrades.

2:05:06.083 --> 2:05:07.916
Soon you will be going home

2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.416
to your parents, wives and children.

2:05:11.375 --> 2:05:12.541
The war is over.

2:05:13.250 --> 2:05:18.083
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

2:05:18.750 --> 2:05:22.916
To the reward of admiration
for all you have achieved here.

2:05:24.416 --> 2:05:26.000
Ah, but comrades,

2:05:27.416 --> 2:05:30.250
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes on your return

2:05:32.291 --> 2:05:33.166
or as weaklings

2:05:33.250 --> 2:05:36.416
and cowards who tucked their tails in
when it really counted?

2:05:36.500 --> 2:05:37.541
We're going home.

2:05:37.625 --> 2:05:38.500
Soldiers.

2:05:39.333 --> 2:05:43.250
We are about to attack them
with the utmost force and vehemence.

2:05:43.958 --> 2:05:47.500
Latierre belongs in German hands.

2:05:47.583 --> 2:05:52.541
We will seize the plains before 11:00 a.m.
and end this war with a merciless strike.

2:05:52.625 --> 2:05:53.958
and make them see…

2:05:55.000 --> 2:05:56.500
…we were victorious.

2:05:56.583 --> 2:06:01.583
Onwards, with God on our side
as he was with our fathers before us.

2:06:01.666 --> 2:06:04.333
I'm not going back
into battle. Not me!

2:06:04.416 --> 2:06:05.583
Shut up!

2:06:06.875 --> 2:06:09.333
-Let me go!
-Follow your orders!

2:06:09.416 --> 2:06:11.208
Do as your told!

2:06:11.291 --> 2:06:12.375
All of you, get back.

2:06:13.083 --> 2:06:15.458
-Please, I didn't do anything!
-Aim!

2:06:15.541 --> 2:06:18.291
-No! No!
-Fire!

2:06:42.583 --> 2:06:43.791
Keep moving!

2:06:46.666 --> 2:06:47.500
Come on!

2:06:55.750 --> 2:06:57.666
Company, halt!

2:07:01.958 --> 2:07:04.125
Rifle off!

2:07:04.208 --> 2:07:07.375
-Fix bayonets!
-Fix bayonets and load!

2:07:22.416 --> 2:07:23.875
What time is it?

2:07:23.958 --> 2:07:25.291
Fifteen minutes to go.

2:08:02.625 --> 2:08:04.000
It belonged to Lefèvre.

2:08:05.291 --> 2:08:07.083
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

2:08:07.791 --> 2:08:10.083
-He won't need it anymore.
-Thank you, sir.

2:08:14.375 --> 2:08:16.208
Here's to you and to Lefèvre.

2:08:22.541 --> 2:08:23.583
Well, it's good.

2:08:27.208 --> 2:08:28.208
The nightmare is over.

2:09:28.375 --> 2:09:31.333
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

2:09:31.416 --> 2:09:33.083
-In position!
-In position!

2:09:35.666 --> 2:09:37.083
Fire!

2:09:37.958 --> 2:09:39.166
Fire!

2:10:14.375 --> 2:10:16.083
Throw the grenades!

2:10:26.791 --> 2:10:27.958
Charge!

2:11:24.208 --> 2:11:26.125
Please, no! No, no!

2:13:16.625 --> 2:13:18.333
Cease fire!

2:13:18.416 --> 2:13:19.958
It is 11:00 a.m.!

2:13:20.625 --> 2:13:22.041
Cease fire!

2:13:22.541 --> 2:13:24.541
Cease fire!

2:13:25.541 --> 2:13:27.625
It is eleven o'clock.

2:16:02.708 --> 2:16:05.583
A light!
Bring me a light! A light please!

2:16:24.875 --> 2:16:26.458
Are you alright?

2:16:27.875 --> 2:16:28.833
Yeah.

2:16:29.666 --> 2:16:32.125
Well, then.
Start gathering, please.

2:19:53.458 --> 2:19:57.041
Shortly after the start of hostilities
in October 1914,

2:19:57.125 --> 2:19:59.958
the Western Front
froze into positional warfare.

2:20:01.458 --> 2:20:07.750
By the end of the war in November 1918,
the front line had barely moved.

2:20:09.416 --> 2:20:12.125
More than three million soldiers
died here,

2:20:12.208 --> 2:20:15.791
often while fighting to gain
only a few hundred meters of ground.

2:20:17.375 --> 2:20:23.708
Almost 17 million people
lost their lives in the First World War.

2:20:25.875 --> 2:20:32.416
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT
