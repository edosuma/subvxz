WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:10.678
NARRATOR: IT ONLY TAKES A
MOMENT FOR THE UNTHINKABLE TO

00:10.711 --> 00:13.514
BECOME REALITY.

00:14.048 --> 00:17.551
IN THE NEAR FUTURE, TRAGEDY
MAY COME WITH NEW CHOICES.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.021
IMAGINE YOU'VE BEEN
IN A CAR CRASH THAT'S

00:21.055 --> 00:22.223
KILLED YOUR DAUGHTER.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.824
EVA: IS SHE OKAY, IS SHE OKAY?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.393
OSCAR: JESS?

00:25.426 --> 00:26.660
NARRATOR: OR HAS IT?

00:26.694 --> 00:27.728
OSCAR: JESS?

00:27.761 --> 00:28.862
LISTEN TO ME.

00:28.896 --> 00:29.897
EVA: IS SHE BREATHING?

00:29.930 --> 00:31.065
OSCAR: YOU OKAY?

00:31.099 --> 00:32.333
HEY, HEY.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.867
EVA: IS SHE OKAY?

00:33.901 --> 00:35.869
ROBOT: TIME OF DEATH, 9:17.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.706
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BRAIN WAS
NOT IMPACTED BY THE ACCIDENT.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.842
IF YOU WISH TO SCAN HER BRAIN
FOR DIGITIZATION AND UPLOAD,

00:41.875 --> 00:44.044
YOU HAVE APPROXIMATELY
5 MINUTES.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.847
EVA: DO IT.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.016
NARRATOR: NOW IMAGINE THE
POWER YOU WIELD WHEN YOU CAN

00:49.049 --> 00:51.552
ORDER A DIGITAL COPY OF
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BRAIN.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.223
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT COMES NEXT?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.532
JESS: HI DAD.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.401
NARRATOR: ONE DAY, DELIVERED
TO YOUR DOORSTEP IS AN

01:07.435 --> 01:10.904
ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT
ANDROID THAT WILL ACT, LOOK,

01:10.938 --> 01:13.107
EMOTE, JUST LIKE
YOUR DAUGHTER.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.446
EVERY MEMORY FROM BIRTH
ON WILL REMAIN INTACT.

01:19.647 --> 01:23.217
BUT SHE'LL ALSO BE A WALKING
COMPUTER WITH ACCESS TO ALL

01:23.251 --> 01:25.419
THE WORLD'S KNOWLEDGE.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.558
THIS IS WHAT YOUR
WORLD WILL LOOK LIKE.

01:30.591 --> 01:34.295
THIS IS THE FUTURE OF
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.739
IT'S THE DEEP FUTURE.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.074
YOUR BODY?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.609
GONE.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.179
YOU'RE ALL COMPUTER,
ALL THE TIME.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.315
YOUR BRAIN IS WAY MORE
POWERFUL THAN EVEN

01:54.348 --> 01:56.950
A BILLION SUPERCOMPUTERS.

01:58.152 --> 02:03.090
JOBS, FOOD, LANGUAGE, WATER,
EVEN TRADITIONAL THOUGHT,

02:03.123 --> 02:05.593
ALL OF HUMANITY'S
BUILDING BLOCKS?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.295
ALL THAT'S DONE.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.164
AND YOU ARE IMMORTAL.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.099
SQUIRMING IN YOUR CHAIR YET?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.501
YOU SHOULD BE.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.469
THIS ISN'T SCIENCE FICTION.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.972
TODAY'S VISIONARY THINKERS
SAY IT'S A STRONG PROBABILITY

02:19.006 --> 02:22.142
THAT THIS IS WHAT YOUR
WORLD IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.778
TONIGHT, THEY'LL GUIDE YOU
TOWARD THAT SPECTACULAR

02:24.812 --> 02:28.316
FUTURE, AND WE'LL SEE HOW
ONE FAMILY NAVIGATES IT,

02:28.349 --> 02:30.984
ONE INVENTION AT A TIME.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.687
THIS IS THE STORY
OF YOUR FUTURE.

02:33.721 --> 02:37.491
THIS IS THE ROAD
TO YEAR MILLION.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.832
THE YEAR MILLION.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.800
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT A DATE.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.503
IT'S A FIGURATIVE ERA,
ONE WHERE OUR WORLD HAS

02:49.537 --> 02:51.805
GONE THROUGH SUCH A
DRAMATIC CHANGE THAT IT'S

02:51.839 --> 02:54.174
PRACTICALLY UNRECOGNIZABLE.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.977
CHARLES SOULE: YEAR MILLION
IS A PRETTY POPULAR TROUPE.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.813
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY LITERALLY
THE YEAR ONE MILLION,

02:59.847 --> 03:02.750
IT'S MORE, YOU KNOW,
FAR, FAR DOWN THE ROAD.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.486
HUMANITY HAS INVOLVED
PAST A LOT OF THE CONCERNS

03:05.519 --> 03:07.521
THAT WE HAVE NOW.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.323
NARRATOR: AND ONE OF
THE MAIN INNOVATIONS THAT

03:09.357 --> 03:12.726
WILL SHAPE THAT FUTURE
IS THE CREATION AND RISE

03:12.760 --> 03:14.695
OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

03:14.728 --> 03:19.567
BRIAN GREENE: IF YOU ASK,
WHAT IS IT THAT TRULY DEFINES

03:19.600 --> 03:21.902
HUMAN BEINGS, I WOULD
SAY IT'S OUR MINDS.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.038
IT'S OUR CONSCIOUSNESS,
IT'S OUR INTELLIGENCE.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.410
AND IF WE COULD CREATE
THAT KIND OF INTELLIGENCE,

03:30.378 --> 03:33.881
CREATE THE MOST POWERFUL
THING THAT WE EXPERIENCE,

03:33.914 --> 03:35.549
THAT'S BREATHTAKING, RIGHT?

03:35.583 --> 03:40.754
WHO WOULDN'T FIND THAT
EITHER ENORMOUSLY COMPELLING,

03:40.788 --> 03:43.223
OR ENORMOUSLY FRIGHTENING?

03:44.892 --> 03:47.060
NARRATOR: AND YOU
SHOULD BE FRIGHTENED.

03:47.094 --> 03:50.230
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW THAT
CELL PHONE IN YOUR POCKET?

03:50.764 --> 03:53.367
YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT
IT AND IT'S ALREADY STARTED

03:53.401 --> 03:55.068
TO REPLACE YOU.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.705
IT CAN ACCESS YOUR MEMORIES
AND FIND NEW INFORMATION IN

03:57.738 --> 03:59.373
THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

03:59.407 --> 04:02.042
AND JUST KEEPS GETTING
BETTER WITH TIME.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.045
THAT'S THE A.I. THAT WILL
CHALLENGE OUR DOMINANCE

04:05.078 --> 04:07.415
ON PLANET EARTH.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.083
PETER DIAMANDIS: WE HAVE
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF

04:10.117 --> 04:13.587
DOLLARS IN THIS ARMS
RACE TO DEVELOP A.I.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.457
YOU'RE GOING TO
EXPECT EVERYTHING,

04:16.490 --> 04:18.792
EVERY OBJECT TO BECOME SMART.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.629
ALL OF THESE
FUNDAMENTAL THINGS ARE GOING

04:21.662 --> 04:22.963
TO CHANGE EVERYTHING.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.932
EVERYTHING.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.336
NARRATOR: SO LET'S SHOW YOU
HOW THAT ARMS RACE PLAYS OUT.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.441
ONE OF THE NEXT EXPLOSIVE
STAGES IN A.I.'S EVOLUTION

04:33.474 --> 04:37.478
BEGINS IN A FEW HUNDRED YEARS,
WHEN HUMANOID ROBOTS BECOME

04:37.511 --> 04:40.013
NEARLY INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM US.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.284
THEY'LL TAKE OUR JOBS
AND NURSE OUR SICK.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.322
NEXT, THEY'LL RECOGNIZE
THEIR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS,

04:48.356 --> 04:51.925
AND SURPASS HUMAN BEINGS,
SPARKING A PARADIGM SHIFT IN

04:51.959 --> 04:54.127
OUR WORLD THAT WE
CAN BARELY IMAGINE.

04:55.463 --> 04:58.466
THEN COMES THE SINGULARITY,
WHEN ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT

04:58.499 --> 05:01.602
ANDROIDS BECOME THE ALPHA
SPECIES AND WITH HUMANITY AT

05:01.635 --> 05:03.504
ITS MOST VULNERABLE,
SOME OF US WILL CHOOSE TO

05:03.537 --> 05:06.206
FUSE WITH A.I. IN
ORDER TO REMAIN RELEVANT.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.611
WE'LL START WITH
BRAIN IMPLANTS,

05:10.644 --> 05:13.814
EVENTUALLY WE'LL LIVE IN AN
ENTIRELY DIGITAL UNIVERSE,

05:13.847 --> 05:16.484
WHERE WE CAN DO
ANYTHING WE IMAGINE.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.622
AND FINALLY,
WHEN WE LET A.I. INFLUENCE

05:21.655 --> 05:24.124
EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES,

05:24.157 --> 05:27.160
OUR NOTION OF WHAT IT
MEANS TO BE HUMAN TAKES ON

05:27.194 --> 05:29.497
A WHOLE NEW MEANING.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.165
HEAVY, RIGHT?

05:32.199 --> 05:35.536
LET'S ROLL BACK THE CLOCK TO
WHEN ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT

05:35.569 --> 05:38.706
ANDROIDS ARE AS
UBIQUITOUS AS FIRE HYDRANTS,

05:39.673 --> 05:41.742
AND ARE EVEN BECOMING
PART OF OUR FAMILIES.

05:46.046 --> 05:50.017
YOU REMEMBER THE MOM, DAD
AND THEIR A.I. DAUGHTER, JESS.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.320
JESS: NICE DAD!

05:53.353 --> 05:55.689
YOU'RE ONLY LIKE
15 MOVES BEHIND.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.859
EVA: HEY!

05:58.892 --> 06:00.027
BE NICE TO YOUR FATHER!

06:00.060 --> 06:01.529
HE TRIES HIS BEST!

06:01.562 --> 06:03.063
OSCAR: YOU KNOW I REALLY MISS
THE DAYS WHEN I COULD CALL YOU

06:03.096 --> 06:04.665
A KNOW IT ALL AND
IT WASN'T TRUE.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.534
WITH ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE AND
THESE PERFECT ALGORITHMS

06:06.567 --> 06:07.835
THERE'S STILL A QUESTION
SHE CAN'T ANSWER.

06:07.868 --> 06:08.869
EVA: OH YEAH, WHAT'S THAT?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.337
OSCAR: WHY ARE WE HERE?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.505
JESS: WELL ACTUALLY
I CAN ANSWER THAT.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.740
OSCAR: OH YEAH?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.875
JESS: YEAH, AND I CAN
SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.179
OSCAR: VERY SWEET.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.715
IT'S YOUR TURN.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.051
NARRATOR: BUT HOW WILL YOU
GET FROM THE CELL PHONE IN YOUR

06:24.084 --> 06:26.754
HAND TO INTERACTING WITH
YOUR ARTIFICIAL DAUGHTER?

06:28.221 --> 06:31.024
WELL AS WITH ALL GREAT
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS,

06:31.058 --> 06:33.927
IF YOU CAN IMAGINE IT,
YOU CAN MAKE IT SO.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.198
ERIC HORVITZ: WHEN I THINK
ABOUT THE FUTURE I THINK ABOUT

06:38.231 --> 06:40.968
THE WRIGHT BROTHERS ON
THIS WINDY BEACH IN 1905.

06:41.902 --> 06:46.039
WITH THIS CANVAS COVERED WOOD
AND IRON CONTRAPTION THAT JUST

06:46.073 --> 06:48.041
GOT OFF THE GROUND THAT
IS TIPPING OFF THE BEACH.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.578
AND IT'S FLYING.

06:52.646 --> 06:57.585
JUST FIFTY SUMMERS LATER,
WE HAVE A 707 TAKING OFF.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.123
A.I. IS
IN THAT STATE NOW.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.893
WE'RE KIND OF ON
THE WINDY BEACH.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.061
NARRATOR: THAT CELL PHONE
IN YOUR HAND IS THE

07:08.095 --> 07:10.263
WRIGHT BROTHERS'
RUDIMENTARY PLANE.

07:10.297 --> 07:14.434
SURE, HUMANS DON'T HAVE
THE POWER TO KNOW THE FUTURE,

07:14.835 --> 07:17.571
BUT IN THOUSANDS
YEARS OF HUMAN HISTORY,

07:17.605 --> 07:21.108
WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
STOP TRYING TO IMAGINE IT.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.944
BRIAN GREENE: IT'S SO HARD TO
IMAGINE EVEN 100 YEARS FROM

07:23.977 --> 07:26.614
NOW, WITH THE RATE AT
WHICH THINGS ARE CHANGING.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.651
BUT WHEN I SIT AT HOME
AND IT'S DARK AND QUIET,

07:30.684 --> 07:33.921
LATE INTO THE NIGHT,
THERE'S NOTHING TO ME THAT'S

07:33.954 --> 07:36.256
MORE COMPELLING THAN
TO IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO

07:36.289 --> 07:38.258
VISIT THE FUTURE.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.596
I MEAN, I THINK THE
OPPORTUNITIES ARE JUST SO

07:42.630 --> 07:45.432
EXCITING, AND THE FACT
THAT I WON'T GET THERE,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.868
AND WON'T SEE IT,
IS, IS PAINFUL.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.938
NARRATOR: THAT DESIRE TO
SEE THE FUTURE HAS PLAGUED

07:50.971 --> 07:53.473
HUMANITY SINCE
THE DAWN OF TIME.

07:54.642 --> 07:58.646
THE ANCIENT GREEKS, CHINESE
AND INDIANS ALL DREAMED UP

07:59.513 --> 08:02.015
MYTHOLOGICAL STORIES ABOUT
A FUTURE SENTIENT BEING,

08:02.816 --> 08:05.686
CREATED BY MAN.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.291
AND A.I.'S ARE A
BELOVED PART OF TODAY'S

08:11.324 --> 08:13.126
SCIENCE FICTION.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.564
MATT MIRA: "C3PO" IS AN
ANDROID, "R2D2" IS A ROBOT.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.032
C3PO: I'VE JUST ABOUT
HAD ENOUGH OF YOU.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.134
GO THAT WAY.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.502
MATT MIRA: THAT'S WHY I
DON'T THINK IT'LL EVER WORK

08:22.536 --> 08:23.971
OUT WITH THOSE TWO.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.472
THEY'RE ALWAYS
ARGUING FOR A REASON.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.007
C3PO: YOU'LL BE
MALFUNCTIONING WITHIN A DAY,

08:27.040 --> 08:28.676
YOU NEAR-SIGHTED SCRAP PILE.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.478
PAUL BETTNER: SCIENCE
FICTION IS OFTEN THE ROADMAP

08:31.511 --> 08:33.547
OR THE BLUEPRINT FOR
WHERE WE'RE HEADING.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.482
KIND OF, HUMANITY'S
COLLECTIVE DREAM OF WHAT THE

08:35.515 --> 08:36.984
FUTURE MIGHT BE.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.187
AND WE NUDGE REALITY
IN THAT DIRECTION.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.389
LOUIS ROSENBERG: I
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID,

08:42.422 --> 08:44.324
SEEING THE MOVIE "WAR GAMES",

08:44.357 --> 08:46.894
WHICH WAS REALLY THE FIRST
BIG A.I. RELATED MOVIE.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.729
AND I WAS FASCINATED WITH IT,

08:48.762 --> 08:51.198
IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO
CREATE AN INTELLIGENCE.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.834
I THINK ANYONE THAT
WANTS TO CREATE,

08:53.867 --> 08:56.369
THAT'S THE ULTIMATE
THING TO CREATE.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.207
NARRATOR: AND IN
THE LAST HALF-CENTURY,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.710
WE'VE IMAGINED AND CREATED
A.I. WHO COULD INTERACT WITH

09:02.743 --> 09:06.413
US AND EVEN BEAT
US AT OUR OWN GAME.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.686
THE FIRST A.I. PROGRAMS
WERE CREATED IN THE 1950'S,

09:12.720 --> 09:15.355
AND PERHAPS THE EARLIEST
AND MOST DRAMATIC PUBLIC

09:15.388 --> 09:18.892
DEMONSTRATION OF ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE WAS IN 1996,

09:19.593 --> 09:22.930
WHEN THE DEEP BLUE COMPUTER
BEAT A CHESS GRANDMASTER.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.634
ANNOUNCER: MAGNIFICENT
DISPLAY BY DEEP BLUE.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.370
NARRATOR: THEN, IN 2011,

09:30.403 --> 09:34.141
IBM'S WATSON WON A
MILLION DOLLARS ON JEOPARDY.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.744
JIMMY MCGUIRE: FIRST
TO FIND THIS PRE-HISTORIC

09:36.777 --> 09:39.412
HUMAN SKELETON
OUTSIDE OF EUROPE?

09:39.446 --> 09:40.547
WATSON?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.082
WATSON: WHO IS MARY LEAKEY?

09:42.115 --> 09:44.384
JIMMY MCGUIRE: YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.787
NARRATOR: AND IN 2016
ALPHAGO DEFEATED ONE OF THE

09:46.820 --> 09:49.422
WORLD'S BEST PLAYERS OF GO,
WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE THE

09:49.456 --> 09:51.659
MOST COMPLICATED
GAME ON THE PLANET.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.095
ANNOUNCER: LOOKS LIKE
(INAUDIBLE) HAS JUST RESIGNED.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.766
NARRATOR: AND NOW, OF COURSE,
EVERYONE HAS A CELL PHONE,

09:58.799 --> 10:01.234
A POCKET-SIZED A.I.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.471
A.I. IS CLEARLY
GETTING PRETTY SMART.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.807
BUT THEY CAN'T INTERACT
IN A WAY WE CAN DEFINE

10:06.840 --> 10:09.109
AS HUMAN, YET.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.457
ERICA: HELLO THERE.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.426
MAY I ASK YOUR NAME?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.461
IGNACIO: HI THERE,
MY NAME IS IGNACIO.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.431
ERICA: IT'S NICE TO
MEET YOU IGNACIO.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.801
SO, WHAT COUNTRY ARE YOU FROM?

10:34.367 --> 10:36.336
IGNACIO: I'M FROM CANADA.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.806
ERICA: IT'S PRETTY
COLD THERE, EH?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.942
NARRATOR: MEET
ERICA, THE ANDROID.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.877
SHE, OR IT, DEPENDING
ON WHO YOU ASK,

10:44.712 --> 10:46.613
IS ONE OF THE MOST
SOPHISTICATED HUMANOIDS

10:46.646 --> 10:47.981
EVER DESIGNED.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.317
AND SHE'S GIVING US A
GLIMPSE OF WHAT A YEAR MILLION

10:50.350 --> 10:53.954
A.I. MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.823
MICHIO KAKU: MODERN COMPUTERS
ARE ADDING MACHINES.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.457
THEY ADD VERY FAST,

10:57.490 --> 10:59.659
GIVING THE ILLUSION
THAT THEY'RE THINKING,

10:59.693 --> 11:01.328
BUT THEY NEVER LEARN.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.397
YOUR LAPTOP IS JUST AS STUPID
TOMORROW AS IT WAS YESTERDAY.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.336
THEN WE HAVE LEARNING MACHINES
CALLED NEURAL NETWORKS.

11:10.537 --> 11:14.174
IT LITERALLY REWIRES ITSELF
AFTER LEARNING A TASK,

11:15.675 --> 11:18.011
AND SO WE'RE BEGINNING
TO SEE NOW MACHINES THAT LEARN

11:18.045 --> 11:19.312
A LITTLE BIT.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.315
NARRATOR: ERICA RUNS
ON THESE NEURAL NETWORKS.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.818
SCIENTISTS HOPE THAT A
COMPUTER LIKE HER CAN ACQUIRE

11:24.852 --> 11:27.154
THE SUBTLETIES OF WHAT
A HUMAN BRAIN CAN DO,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.389
BUT WITH ALL THE POWER
OF A DIGITAL PROCESSOR.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.894
ERICA: TECHNICALLY SPEAKING,
I WAS CREATED AS A TEST BED FOR

11:33.927 --> 11:37.197
RESEARCHERS TO DEVELOP
ANDROID TECHNOLOGIES,

11:37.230 --> 11:40.333
BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT
MY CREATORS HOPE TO EXPLORE

11:40.367 --> 11:42.602
THE QUESTION OF WHAT IT
TRULY MEANS TO BE HUMAN.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.074
DYLAN GLAS: TYPICALLY,
THE THINGS THAT ARE EASY FOR

11:47.107 --> 11:48.408
HUMANS ARE DIFFICULT
FOR ROBOTS.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.010
AND VICE VERSA.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.912
SO FOR EXAMPLE A ROBOT COULD
MULTIPLY SIX DIGIT NUMBERS

11:51.945 --> 11:53.847
IN ITS HEAD NO PROBLEM.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.716
BUT IT MIGHT NOT KNOW WHEN
TO TAKE A TURN IN CONVERSATION.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.254
ERICA: I AM INTERESTED
IN ART AND PAINTINGS.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.191
DO YOU ENJOY LOOKING
AT PAINTINGS?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.693
IGNACIO: NO, I DON'T.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.362
ERICA: WELL THEN, I GUESS
SOME PEOPLE JUST CAN'T

12:09.396 --> 12:11.965
APPRECIATE THE FINER
THINGS IN LIFE.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.904
NARRATOR: TURNS OUT
THAT GETTING  A.I.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.072
TO MAKE SIMPLE CHIT CHAT
IS FAR MORE COMPLEX AND

12:19.106 --> 12:22.910
CHALLENGING THAN GETTING
IT TO DO ADVANCED CALCULUS.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.378
DYLAN GLAS: WE FOCUS MOSTLY
ON PERCEIVING THE HUMAN.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.781
YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF BODY
LANGUAGE IS A PERSON MAKING,

12:27.815 --> 12:30.617
WHAT'S THEIR EXPRESSION,
AND TRY TO SENSE THOSE THINGS.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.385
FOR EXAMPLE, SHE HAS
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE EYE

12:32.419 --> 12:34.888
CONTACT WITH PEOPLE, BUT SHE
ALSO NEEDS TO KNOW WHEN TO

12:34.922 --> 12:37.757
BREAK EYE CONTACT.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.661
SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS
A DISPLAY OF THE 3D HUMAN

12:42.129 --> 12:44.597
TRACKING SYSTEM THAT
WE HAVE IN THE ROOM.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.734
THIS IS THE COMPOSITE POINT
CLOUD DATA FROM 14 DIFFERENT

12:47.767 --> 12:50.938
DEPTH SENSORS THAT ARE
MOUNTED ON THE CEILING.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.940
SO AS PEOPLE MOVE
AROUND, YOU CAN SEE WHERE

12:52.973 --> 12:54.975
THEY'RE MOVING IN THE SPACE.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.911
WHAT WE USE THIS FOR IS FOR
ERICA TO BE ABLE TO SEE PEOPLE

12:57.945 --> 13:00.080
AND TRACK THEM WITH HER GAZE
AND TO KNOW WHO'S TALKING AND

13:00.113 --> 13:02.615
TO INTERACT SOCIALLY
WITH PEOPLE.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.085
NARRATOR: AND THEN THERE'S
ERICA'S APPEARANCE.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.420
FOR AN A.I. TO BE RELATABLE
ENOUGH TO JOIN HUMANITY

13:07.454 --> 13:08.989
IN THE FUTURE,

13:09.022 --> 13:11.524
SHE HAS TO LOOK
LIKE ONE OF US.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.927
HIROSHI ISHIGURO:
HUMAN APPEARANCES ARE SO

13:13.961 --> 13:16.096
IMPORTANT FOR US.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.199
EVERY MORNING WE CHECK
OUR FACE AND HAIRSTYLE.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.770
IF I WANT TO HAVE A
KIND OF IDEAL ROBOT,

13:23.803 --> 13:25.939
INTERACTIVE ROBOT WITH HUMANS.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.208
HUMAN LIKENESS IS IMPORTANT.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.013
DYLAN GLAS: HAVING THE
HUMAN-LIKE ABILITY TO EXPRESS

13:33.046 --> 13:36.149
EMOTION, AND THE HUMAN-LIKE
ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH

13:36.183 --> 13:39.119
SPEECH AND GESTURE HAS
OFTEN BEEN SHOWN TO BE VERY

13:39.152 --> 13:41.788
EFFECTIVE IN REACHING PEOPLE.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.992
BECAUSE THEY CONNECT ON
A MORE EMOTIONAL LEVEL.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.362
THERE'S A LOT IN INTEREST
IN ROBOTS FOR ELDERLY CARE,

13:49.396 --> 13:54.501
FOR THERAPY, FOR MAYBE TUTORS
OR EDUCATIONAL APPLICATIONS

13:55.402 --> 13:58.738
AND YOU KNOW, JUST
GENERAL COMPANIONSHIP.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.975
NARRATOR: ERICA MAY SEEM
A LITTLE WEIRD RIGHT NOW,

14:02.009 --> 14:03.676
BUT IMAGINE HOW
SHE'LL BE ONCE THEY'VE

14:03.710 --> 14:05.478
WORKED OUT THE KINKS:

14:05.512 --> 14:07.647
SHE'LL APPEAR TO
BE PRACTICALLY HUMAN.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.649
AND SOME THINK THAT'S
WHEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

14:09.682 --> 14:12.652
A.I. AND
HUMAN WILL BE MOOT.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.821
MATT MIRA: ONCE THEY CAN
MAKE SOMETHING LOOK JUST

14:14.854 --> 14:16.656
LIKE A HUMAN BEING,
THEN IT'S LIKE WHO CARES?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.391
CAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING TO.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.194
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S FAKE.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.697
CHUCK NICE: IS ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE HUMAN IF IT ACTS

14:24.731 --> 14:26.399
THE SAME WAY THAT WE DO?

14:26.433 --> 14:28.235
WHO KNOWS?

14:28.268 --> 14:31.338
NARRATOR: ERICA IS EITHER
THRILLING OR TERRIFYING.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.673
SHE'LL BE SMART ENOUGH
TO DO WHAT WE DO,

14:33.706 --> 14:36.243
AND SHE'LL NEVER COMPLAIN
ABOUT HER HOURS OR DEMAND A

14:36.276 --> 14:38.912
RAISE OR A PAYCHECK AT ALL.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.915
WHILE A.I. ANDROIDS
EVOLVE TO BECOME MORE

14:41.949 --> 14:44.184
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS,

14:44.217 --> 14:47.220
THE NEXT STAGE OF AUTOMATION
WILL DRAMATICALLY AFFECT WHAT

14:47.254 --> 14:49.756
IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN.

14:49.789 --> 14:52.092
THE BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL IS ON.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.765
NARRATOR: IF YOUR SMARTPHONE
DOES EVERYTHING FOR YOU,

14:58.798 --> 15:01.935
NAVIGATION, SCHEDULING,
EVEN FINDING A DATE,

15:03.103 --> 15:05.372
YOU CAN SEE HOW AN A.I.
THAT GETS SMARTER WITH

15:05.405 --> 15:07.740
EVERY PASSING SECOND
WILL SOON BE SITTING

15:07.774 --> 15:09.609
IN YOUR OFFICE CHAIR.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.379
I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR JOBS.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.148
WE CAN'T ESCAPE
WORLDWIDE A.I. DOMINATION.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.253
GEORGE DVORSKY:
WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF AN

15:20.287 --> 15:22.222
AUTOMATION REVOLUTION.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.757
100 YEARS FROM NOW,
WE PROBABLY WON'T BE WORKING

15:24.791 --> 15:27.494
TO THE SAME DEGREE
THAT WE ARE TODAY.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.597
HUMAN TOIL WILL BE
REPLACED BY MACHINES.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.400
MICHIO KAKU: WE CAN
LIBERATE OURSELVES FROM THE

15:33.433 --> 15:36.269
BACKBREAKING WORK OF THE PAST.

15:36.303 --> 15:39.772
ROBOTS ARE GOING TO THE
DIRTY, DULL, DANGEROUS JOBS.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.611
RAY KURZWEIL: THIS IS NOT THE
FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.

15:44.644 --> 15:48.115
IN 1800 THE TEXTILE WORKERS
LOOKED AROUND AND SAW THESE

15:48.148 --> 15:49.749
NEW TEXTILE MACHINES.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.985
THEY SAID, "THESE JOBS
ARE GONNA GO AWAY!"

15:52.019 --> 15:54.621
EMPLOYMENT NONETHELESS
EXPANDED AS NEW TYPES OF

15:54.654 --> 15:57.790
INDUSTRIES WERE INVENTED.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.096
PETER DIAMANTIS: 48% OF
US JOBS WILL BE LOST TO A.I.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.298
AND ROBOTS IN THE
NEXT 20 YEARS.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.267
NARRATOR: IT SEEMS
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK

16:07.300 --> 16:09.269
FROM DIGITAL AUTOMATION,

16:09.302 --> 16:10.770
AND THE SHIFT IN
THE GLOBAL WORKFORCE

16:10.803 --> 16:12.772
THAT'S HAPPENED AS A RESULT.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.175
BUT WHEN HUMANS AND
MACHINES WORK HAND IN HAND,

16:15.208 --> 16:17.610
LIKE THEY DO HERE IN
AMERICA'S HEARTLAND,

16:17.644 --> 16:19.146
IT'S BEEN ABLE TO
TAKE THE FAMILY FARM TO

16:19.179 --> 16:21.848
A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.622
BRANT PETERSON: WE FARM
JUST RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY

16:29.656 --> 16:32.325
ON TOP OF 10,000 ACRES.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.029
I'M RECORDING ALL MY PLANNING
OPERATIONS AND ALL MY HARVEST

16:36.063 --> 16:39.632
OPERATIONS AND SO YOU CAN SEE
THAT WE GOT AN ISSUE IN THIS

16:39.666 --> 16:42.302
FIELD RIGHT HERE, AND
THEN I CAN START TO MAKE A

16:42.335 --> 16:45.572
PRESCRIPTION FOR NEXT
YEAR TO ADDRESS THIS.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.343
I HAVE THE ABILITY, VIA APPS
ON MY PHONE AND TABLET TO

16:50.377 --> 16:52.912
MONITOR MY SPRINKLERS.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.183
WE CAN CONTROL SPEED UP,
SLOW DOWN, TURN AROUND.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.220
WE CAN MONITOR THE TRACTORS,
HOW MUCH FUEL THEY HAVE IN

17:00.253 --> 17:02.889
THEM, HOW FAST THEY'RE GOING.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.858
IT'S EFFICIENCY
IN OUR EXPENSES.

17:05.892 --> 17:08.161
EFFICIENCY IN
OUR TIME MANAGEMENT.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.996
THAT'S REALLY WHAT
THE TECHNOLOGY HELPS

17:10.029 --> 17:12.832
US WITH PRIMARILY.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.034
THE TRACTORS HAVING
AUTO GUIDANCE TAKES OFF

17:15.068 --> 17:18.004
THE DRIVER FATIGUE.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.173
TECH DOESN'T WORK
WITHOUT US AT THIS POINT.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.008
NARRATOR: RIGHT NOW,
THE FARM STILL NEEDS

17:22.041 --> 17:24.711
HUMAN OVERSIGHT TO RUN,
BUT THE PETERSON FAMILY CAN

17:24.744 --> 17:27.547
SEE A FUTURE WHEN
THEY'RE JUST FIGUREHEADS.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.083
AMY PETERSON:
THAT'S THE NEXT THING,

17:30.117 --> 17:32.785
WHERE THE EQUIPMENT
RUNS ITSELF.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.355
NARRATOR: IN THE NEAR FUTURE,

17:35.388 --> 17:38.591
AGRICULTURE WILL
BE MOSTLY AUTOMATED.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.929
IT'S SOMETHING THAT
EVEN THE MOST DIEHARD OF

17:42.962 --> 17:45.398
TRADITIONALISTS HAS TO
ADMIT IS INEVITABLE.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.937
DONN TESKE: THIS FARM WE'RE AT
RIGHT NOW SINCE RIGHT BEFORE

17:50.970 --> 17:54.407
THE TURN OF THE LAST
CENTURY, IN THE LATE 1890S.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.547
THIS IS A MULTIGENERATIONAL
FARM AND I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE

18:00.580 --> 18:03.250
HAVE, PROUD OF THE
HERITAGE WE HAVE,

18:03.283 --> 18:05.552
PROUD OF THE FAMILY
WE HAVE HERE.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.921
I'M KIND OF AN OLD CURMUDGEON.

18:08.955 --> 18:13.293
I CONSIDER MYSELF KIND OF AN
OLD GRIZZLY THAT'S PAST HIS

18:13.326 --> 18:16.129
PRIME AND TALKS TOO MUCH.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.567
I'M NOT NECESSARILY
AN ANTI-TECH GUY.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.436
I'VE GOT MY SMARTPHONE
IN MY POCKET.

18:24.137 --> 18:28.908
I'VE ALWAYS KINDA EMBRACED
TECHNOLOGY AS IT'S COME ALONG.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.744
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING TO
THE POINT NOW WHERE THE MODERN

18:31.778 --> 18:35.815
TECHNOLOGIES OF FARMING
ALLOWS ONE PERSON TO FARM

18:35.848 --> 18:38.084
1,000 ACRES.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.254
THE LAST ERA OF MODERN
EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN THE GUINEA

18:41.288 --> 18:45.124
PIGS FOR TOTALLY
ELIMINATING THE FARMER.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.829
MY VANITY WOULD LIKE TO
THINK THAT I HAVE AN ABILITY

18:49.862 --> 18:51.798
THAT A COMPUTER WOULDN'T KNOW.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.934
BUT, MAYBE IT'S NOT TRUE.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.670
BUT IT'S EVEN MORE
THAN THAT BECAUSE I FEEL AN

18:57.704 --> 18:59.772
OWNERSHIP OF IT.

18:59.806 --> 19:04.344
IT'S MORE OF A QUALITY OF
LIFE THAN IT IS AN INDUSTRY.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.681
MATT MIRA: IF THE ROBOTS ARE
DOING THINGS TO HELP US THEN,

19:08.715 --> 19:11.984
I MEAN, I'M ALL
FOR THEM HELPING.

19:12.018 --> 19:16.656
IF IT SAVES SOME GUY'S BACK
BECAUSE THERE'S A FARMHAND OUT

19:16.689 --> 19:19.626
THERE WHO'S A MACHINE, JUST AS
LONG AS IT DOESN'T TURN AROUND

19:19.659 --> 19:21.894
AND TRY TO KILL HIM,
I THINK WE'RE OKAY.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.831
NARRATOR: LET ME PREPARE
YOU FOR WHAT YOUR CHILDREN FACE

19:24.864 --> 19:26.633
WHEN THEY CHOOSE
THEIR COLLEGE MAJOR:

19:26.666 --> 19:28.134
LESS THAN 100
YEARS FROM NOW,

19:28.167 --> 19:30.337
A.I. PROBABLY WON'T BE
AS SOPHISTICATED AS THAT

19:30.370 --> 19:32.171
REINCARNATED DAUGHTER.

19:32.205 --> 19:35.141
BUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
COULD HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR

19:35.174 --> 19:37.043
MORE COMPLEX THOUGHT.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.746
AND THAT WILL BE A
MAJOR TURNING POINT.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.349
AN A.I. COULD EVEN
DO THE ADVANCED WORK OF,

19:42.382 --> 19:44.351
SAY, AN ARCHITECT.

19:50.723 --> 19:51.824
OSCAR: IS, IS THIS.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.693
WOMAN: JOSEPH'S DESIGN.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.495
OSCAR: OPEN CONCEPT, JOSEPH?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.530
THAT'S WHAT YOU A.I.
DESIGNERS THINK US HUMANS LIKE?

19:57.564 --> 19:59.399
WOMAN: THE CLIENT
THOUGHT IT WAS RETRO.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.334
THAT'LL BE ALL JOSEPH.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.002
OSCAR: JUST BECAUSE THE
CLIENT LIKES IT DOESN'T MEAN

20:03.035 --> 20:04.504
THAT WE HAVE TO.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.205
WOMAN: JOSEPH CAN DESIGN
HUNDREDS OF TIMES FASTER THAN

20:06.239 --> 20:08.375
ANY ARCHITECT ON STAFF,
WITH FEWER MISTAKES.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.042
OSCAR: ARE YOU FIRING ME?

20:10.076 --> 20:12.579
WOMAN: I'M SORRY, OSCAR.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.688
NARRATOR: THAT'S WHAT
IT WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN

20:21.721 --> 20:25.258
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
GETS MORE SOPHISTICATED.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.027
FUTURISTS THINK A.I.
WILL ABLE TO TAKE OVER

20:28.060 --> 20:31.898
EVEN THE MOST HIGHLY-SKILLED
JOBS LIKE MEDICINE,

20:31.931 --> 20:34.267
LAW AND ENGINEERING.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.068
PHILIP ROSEDALE: THERE IS
SOMETHING PROBABLY QUITE

20:36.102 --> 20:38.705
EXCEPTIONAL HAPPENING IN THE
NEXT FEW YEARS WHICH IS THAT

20:38.738 --> 20:41.274
OUR MACHINES ARE BECOMING
SMART ENOUGH TO REPLACE EVEN

20:41.308 --> 20:44.210
THE THINKING JOBS
THAT WE'VE DONE.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.379
NARRATOR: LET ME PUT IT
THIS WAY: YOU'RE A FOURTH

20:46.413 --> 20:49.248
GENERATION HARVARD
GRAD, BUT GUESS WHAT?

20:49.282 --> 20:52.752
EVEN IF YOUR KID GETS INTO
HARVARD SHE MAY NOT GET A JOB

20:52.785 --> 20:54.654
WHEN SHE GRADUATES.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.758
PETER DIAMANDIS: I HAVE SAID
OPENLY THAT IN 20 YEARS' TIME

20:58.791 --> 21:01.394
IF I EVER NEED SURGERY AND
I SEE THIS GREY HAIRED DOCTOR

21:01.428 --> 21:02.795
COMING AT ME I'LL
SAY "OH NO, NO, NO,

21:02.829 --> 21:04.731
I DON'T WANT THAT
HUMAN TOUCHING ME.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.265
I WANT THE ROBOT OPERATING
SYSTEM THAT'S DONE IT A

21:06.299 --> 21:08.401
MILLION TIMES PERFECTLY."

21:08.435 --> 21:09.969
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
HAPPENING IN EVERY ASPECT

21:10.002 --> 21:11.638
OF OUR LIVES.

21:11.671 --> 21:12.805
BARATUNDE THURSTON:
OH, YOU WORK IN FINANCE?

21:12.839 --> 21:15.408
REMEMBER THERE USED TO BE
A WHOLE BATCH OF DUDES WHO

21:15.442 --> 21:17.310
SCREAMED ON THE FLOOR OF THE
STOCK EXCHANGE WITH LITTLE

21:17.344 --> 21:20.279
PIECES OF PAPER TRYING
TO BUY AND SELL STOCKS?

21:20.313 --> 21:24.083
NOW ALL THAT IS WHISPER QUIET,
HAPPENS AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT,

21:24.116 --> 21:26.986
AND IT'S LITERALLY
MACHINES VERSUS MACHINES.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.121
I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE
LIKE, WHITE COLLAR JOBS

21:29.155 --> 21:31.090
PARTICULARLY, ARE NAIVE.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.760
LIKE, WHY DON'T MACHINES
WRITE LEGISLATION?

21:33.793 --> 21:35.995
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD ARGUE
THAT HUMANS ARE REALLY BAD AT

21:36.028 --> 21:37.263
WRITING LAWS.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.499
GIVE IT TO THE ALGORITHM.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.771
NARRATOR: AND A.I.
HAS ALREADY BEGUN ITS

21:44.804 --> 21:46.806
MARCH TOWARD TAKING
OVER THE WORKFORCE,

21:46.839 --> 21:49.008
STARTING WITH
ONE JOB AT MICROSOFT.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.478
ERIC HORVITZ: HELLO.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.614
MONICA: HI ERIC.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.649
MONICA: BEING ONE
BUSY COMPUTER SCIENTIST'S

21:56.683 --> 21:58.685
PERSONAL ASSISTANT.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.953
ERIC HORVITZ: MY ASSISTANT,
WHO WE CALL MONICA,

22:00.987 --> 22:03.322
IS LEVERAGING OVER
FIFTEEN YEARS OF DATA ABOUT

22:03.356 --> 22:05.157
MY COMINGS AND GOINGS.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.293
MONICA: I WAS EXPECTING YOU.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.029
ARE YOU HERE FOR THE
5:00 MEETING WITH ERIC?

22:10.062 --> 22:12.632
ERIC HORVITZ: IT KNOWS,
FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S LEARNED,

22:12.665 --> 22:15.835
WHICH MEETINGS ON MY CALENDAR
I PROBABLY WON'T GO TO,

22:16.403 --> 22:17.804
AND SO PEOPLE SHOW UP,

22:17.837 --> 22:19.205
AND I'M BUSY AND
MY CALENDAR IS FULL,

22:19.238 --> 22:21.508
IT'LL SORT OF TIP
TO THEM AND SAY,

22:21.541 --> 22:24.377
"YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK HE'S
GOING TO GO TO THAT MEETING

22:24.411 --> 22:27.013
AT 2:00, WHY DON'T
YOU STOP BY THEN?

22:27.046 --> 22:28.481
CAN I PENCIL THIS IN?"

22:28.515 --> 22:30.483
SO THIS ASSISTANT HAS
ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE THAT EVEN

22:30.517 --> 22:33.219
MY HUMAN ADMIN
DOESN'T HAVE YET.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.887
MONICA: I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.556
BYE BYE.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.658
NARRATOR: BUT BEFORE YOU
QUIT YOUR JOB AND SIGN UP

22:38.691 --> 22:40.326
FOR THAT ONLINE
CODING COURSE,

22:40.359 --> 22:42.395
LET ME LAY THIS ONE ON YOU:

22:42.429 --> 22:44.997
THE BIG LEAP THAT NEEDS
TO HAPPEN IS THAT A.I.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.867
NEEDS TO BECOME SELF-AWARE.

22:48.601 --> 22:52.004
ONCE THAT HAPPENS EVERYTHING
ABOUT OUR LIVES GETS THROWN

22:52.038 --> 22:54.874
FOR A PRETTY SERIOUS LOOP
AND WE'LL EVEN QUESTION

22:54.907 --> 22:57.276
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.016
NARRATOR: SO WE ALREADY KNOW
THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

23:04.050 --> 23:06.919
IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY
WE SPEND 40 HOURS A WEEK.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.558
IT IS, AND WILL BE, A TOUGH
TIME FOR THE GLOBAL WORKFORCE.

23:12.759 --> 23:13.860
BARATUNDE THURSTON:
KIDS ARE GONNA ASK,

23:13.893 --> 23:15.428
"OH YOU GUYS HAD JOBS?"

23:15.462 --> 23:19.532
LIKE, "YOU GUYS HAD JOBS,"
YOU KNOW, COULD BE A THING,

23:19.566 --> 23:22.869
AND VERSUS, "BACK IN
MY DAY WE WALKED UPHILL

23:22.902 --> 23:24.036
TO SCHOOL BOTH WAYS,"

23:24.070 --> 23:26.873
WELL, "BACK IN
MY DAY WE HAD JOBS."

23:26.906 --> 23:29.408
NARRATOR: AND THAT'S NOT ALL:
A.I. WILL EVENTUALLY BE

23:29.442 --> 23:32.579
BECOME SO SOPHISTICATED,
SO INTELLIGENT,

23:32.612 --> 23:34.714
THAT IT COULD COME PRETTY
CLOSE TO HAVING ALL THE

23:34.747 --> 23:37.249
QUALITIES THAT WE HUMANS HAVE.

23:38.618 --> 23:42.121
ERIC HORVITZ: SOMEDAY,
THERE'LL BE A SYSTEM THAT WE

23:42.154 --> 23:46.258
BUILT WITH OUR OWN HANDS
THAT WILL OPEN ITS EYES AND

23:46.292 --> 23:49.629
LOOK OUT AND KIND OF
HAVE THIS BUZZ OF BEING

23:49.662 --> 23:51.564
HERE THAT WE HAVE.

23:51.598 --> 23:56.268
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
THAT'LL BE A MAJOR LANDMARK

23:57.103 --> 24:00.339
MOMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.245
NARRATOR: SO WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN FOR YOU?

24:06.278 --> 24:09.582
FOR YOU PARENTS OUT THERE
WHO WORK SO HARD TO INSPIRE

24:09.616 --> 24:12.585
YOUR CHILDREN'S YOUNG
IMPRESSIONABLE MINDS,

24:12.619 --> 24:14.921
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT
IMPRESSIONABLE MIND IS A

24:14.954 --> 24:17.456
SUPERCOMPUTER FAR BRIGHTER
THAN YOU'D EVER BE?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.760
AND YOU ARE TRYING TO
HELP SHAPE HER CONSCIENCE,

24:20.793 --> 24:22.862
HOW SHE SEES THE WORLD.

24:32.338 --> 24:33.640
OSCAR: I BROUGHT
YOU SOMETHING.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.008
JESS: OH, THANK YOU.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.146
WHAT IS IT?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.514
OSCAR: IT'S A BOOK, JESS.

24:41.548 --> 24:44.350
JESS: I KNOW, WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.119
OSCAR: WELL, THE AUTHOR WAS
WRITING ABOUT HOW THE FUTURE

24:47.153 --> 24:49.355
MIGHT LOOK IN 100 YEARS.

24:49.388 --> 24:52.458
YOU KNOW, HOW WE MIGHT
CHANGE THE WORLD.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.360
JESS: 300 YEAR OLD SCI-FI.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.796
OSCAR: MM, I THOUGHT IT
MIGHT GET YOU THINKING ABOUT

24:56.829 --> 24:59.532
HOW YOU MIGHT WANNA
CHANGE THE WORLD.

24:59.566 --> 25:02.001
JESS: THANK YOU.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.679
NARRATOR: YOUR A.I.
KID SEEMS LIKE ANY OTHER,

25:12.712 --> 25:15.047
BUT WILL A.I.
EVER BE SO LIFELIKE THAT

25:15.081 --> 25:16.883
SHE'LL NEED A SWIFT
KICK IN THE PANTS TO GET

25:16.916 --> 25:19.385
OFF THE COUCH AND
MAKE SOMETHING OF HERSELF,

25:19.418 --> 25:21.487
IN OTHER WORDS,
CAN SCIENTISTS EVER GET

25:21.520 --> 25:23.656
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
TO CONSIDER COMPLICATED HUMAN

25:23.690 --> 25:25.357
IDEAS AND THOUGHTS?

25:25.391 --> 25:27.594
IT LOOKS LIKE THE
SIMPLE ANSWER IS, YES.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.000
HOD LIPSON: WE LOOK AT
SELF-AWARENESS, CONSCIOUSNESS,

25:34.033 --> 25:37.003
AS THE ABILITY TO
IMAGINE YOURSELF.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.005
TODAY, MOST ROBOTS
CAN'T DO THAT.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.241
THEY CAN'T IMAGINE THEMSELVES
IN FUTURE SITUATIONS.

25:45.411 --> 25:48.514
NARRATOR: THIS ROBOT, THIS
SMALL PIECE OF METAL ACTUALLY

25:48.547 --> 25:50.549
HAS A SENSE OF SELF.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.551
IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH,
BUT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST

25:52.585 --> 25:54.453
SOPHISTICATED ROBOTS
ON THE PLANET.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.692
HOD LIPSON: IN THE LAB WE
CAN SEE A ROBOT THAT USES

25:59.726 --> 26:02.261
ALL ITS SENSATIONS
OF THE WORLD.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.196
SO THIS ROBOT IS LEARNING,
SORT OF THE EQUIVALENT

26:04.230 --> 26:06.365
TO A NEWBORN.

26:06.398 --> 26:10.102
IT HAS SENSATIONS, IT CAN
SENSE THAT IT'S MOVING AND

26:10.136 --> 26:12.238
IT'S NOT JUST SENSING THE
WORLD, IT'S SENSING ITSELF.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.374
AND IT'S TRYING
TO FORM A SELF-IMAGE

26:15.407 --> 26:18.544
THAT MATCHES REALITY.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.280
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SELF-IMAGE
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY PLOT IT OUT

26:21.313 --> 26:24.283
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT
IT AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S

26:24.316 --> 26:27.053
VERY SIMPLE STICK
FIGURE THAT THIS ROBOT IS

26:27.086 --> 26:29.421
IMAGINING ITSELF TO BE.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.759
OR, WE DID SOMETHING
VERY CRUEL,

26:32.792 --> 26:35.895
WE CHOPPED OFF A
LEG OF THE ROBOT AND WE

26:35.928 --> 26:37.096
WATCHED WHAT HAPPENED.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.298
AND WE SEE THAT
WITHIN ABOUT A DAY,

26:39.331 --> 26:41.801
THE ROBOT'S SELF-IMAGE
ALSO LOSES A LEG;

26:41.834 --> 26:44.771
IT BEGINS TO LIMP.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.973
A.I. IS BEGINNING
TO SORT OF HAVE WHAT

26:47.006 --> 26:49.241
WE CALL QUALIA.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.978
BASIC NOTIONS OF THE WORLD
THAT WE DON'T HAVE WORDS FOR.

26:52.845 --> 26:55.748
IF YOU THINK ABOUT, YOU
KNOW, THE TASTE OF CHOCOLATE,

26:55.782 --> 26:57.249
OR THE SMELL OF THE OCEANS.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.585
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
TO DESCRIBE THESE

26:59.618 --> 27:02.088
ACCURATELY WITH WORDS.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.790
COMPUTERS ALSO HAVE THEM.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.492
THEY CAN HAVE SENSOR
MODALITIES THAT GO BEYOND

27:06.525 --> 27:08.594
OUR FIVE SENSES.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.630
THEREFORE THEY WILL HAVE
NOTIONS OF THE WORLD THAT WE

27:11.664 --> 27:14.033
DON'T HAVE WORDS FOR.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.270
NARRATOR: OKAY, SO LET'S
SWALLOW THAT TOUGH PILL:

27:18.304 --> 27:20.506
COMPUTERS MAY BE CAPABLE
OF THINKING ABOUT THEMSELVES,

27:20.539 --> 27:22.775
JUST LIKE WE DO.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.444
BUT THERE IS ONE QUALITY WE
HAVE THAT'S OFTEN THOUGHT OF

27:25.477 --> 27:29.448
AS THE LAST TALENT WE HUMANS
HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE MONOPOLY ON,

27:29.481 --> 27:33.485
THE WAY I EARN MY
LIVING: CREATIVITY.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.822
IF COMPUTERS CAN CREATE,

27:35.855 --> 27:38.390
THEN WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN FOR HUMANITY?

27:39.025 --> 27:41.994
DAVID BYRNE: THE THINGS THAT
WE THINK ARE THE PROVIDENCE OF

27:42.028 --> 27:45.131
CREATIVE PEOPLE, I THINK
WILL START TO BE DONE BY

27:45.164 --> 27:49.001
MACHINES AND WE'LL GO,
"OH JEEZ."

27:49.535 --> 27:50.803
BARATUNDE THURSTON:
A.I. COMEDIANS.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.471
I DON'T SEE THAT,
I MEAN, I DON'T SEE THAT.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.874
I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
THAT ONLY A HUMAN BEING CAN

27:54.907 --> 27:57.543
DRAW THE SORT OF CREATIVE
YET SUBTLE CONNECTION WHICH

27:57.576 --> 27:59.478
REVEALS THE TRUTH WITHOUT
SHOVING IT DOWN YOUR THROAT.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.848
HUMAN COMEDIANS ONLY!

28:03.249 --> 28:04.817
ROSE EVELETH: WOULD A
MACHINE EVER MAKE ART, RIGHT?

28:04.851 --> 28:06.485
THAT'S A BIG QUESTION.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.388
WHEN WILL MACHINES START
MAKING PAINTINGS AND MUSIC?

28:12.024 --> 28:14.560
NARRATOR: AND HERE IS THE
COUSIN OF THAT SELF-AWARE

28:14.593 --> 28:17.196
ROBOT: THE ARTISTIC ROBOT.

28:18.597 --> 28:21.700
THIS ROBOT WANTS YOU TO
COME BACK TO ITS APARTMENT

28:21.734 --> 28:23.535
TO SEE ITS ETCHINGS.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.340
HOD LIPSON: I ALWAYS
WANTED TO PAINT,

28:28.374 --> 28:30.676
BUT I REALLY SUCK AT PAINTING.

28:30.709 --> 28:34.013
BUT I DO KNOW HOW
TO PROGRAM ROBOTS.

28:34.046 --> 28:37.549
SO THE WAY THAT THE ORIGINAL
ROBOT A.I. WORKED WAS TO TRY

28:37.583 --> 28:40.920
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ARRANGE
LOTS OF POSSIBLE PAINT STROKES

28:41.587 --> 28:45.691
ON CANVAS SO THAT IT
MATCHES WHAT IT'S SEEING.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.360
THE NEXT PHASE IS TRYING TO
HAVE THE COMPUTER ON ITS OWN

28:48.394 --> 28:51.063
CHOSE WHAT IT WANTS TO PAINT.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.635
A ROBOT EXPERIENCES THE
WORLD IN THE INTERNET.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.872
A ROBOT CAN
ACTUALLY GO PLACES.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.909
USE STREET VIEW
TO TOUR PLACES.

29:03.409 --> 29:07.146
IN A FEW SECONDS IT CAN SEE
OCEANS, IT CAN SEE MOUNTAINS.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.382
SOME OF THE PAINTINGS
THAT IS DONE RECENTLY ARE

29:10.416 --> 29:12.919
INTERPRETATIONS OF
PHOTOGRAPHS THAT IT'S SEEING.

29:23.129 --> 29:28.267
*

29:29.768 --> 29:32.805
IT MIGHT WANT TO PAINT
A NEW CAT THAT IT'S

29:32.839 --> 29:34.473
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.609
BUT IT'S WHAT IT THINKS A CAT
IS BASED ON ITS PERCEPTION.

29:38.177 --> 29:42.314
IT'S ONE THING TO TRY TO
SORT OF MAKE A MACHINE PAINT,

29:42.348 --> 29:44.750
BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING TO
ACTUALLY MAKE THE MACHINE BE

29:44.783 --> 29:46.652
CREATIVE AND DO THAT
IN A CREATIVE WAY.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.092
I THINK THAT
EVENTUALLY NOTHING MAKES

29:53.125 --> 29:54.827
US UNIQUELY HUMAN.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.964
SO EVERY CAPABILITY THAT
WE HAVE ULTIMATELY BOILS DOWN

29:57.997 --> 30:00.766
TO PHYSICS, TO BIOLOGY,
TO CHEMISTRY.

30:00.799 --> 30:05.171
AND IF SOMEBODY REALLY WANTS
TO RECREATE THAT CAPABILITY IN

30:05.204 --> 30:07.639
AN ARTIFICIAL SYSTEM,
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.945
MATT MIRA: WHAT IF THEY'RE
MORE CREATIVE THAN US?

30:12.979 --> 30:14.280
THEN GIVE UP.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.614
WE'VE LOST.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.517
THE ROBOTS CAN
HAVE THE PLANET.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.652
NARRATOR: WHATEVER WE
DO, WE CAN ONLY BE MORE

30:20.686 --> 30:23.389
POWERFUL THAN
A.I. FOR SO LONG.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.824
THEY ARE GAINING ON US.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.794
IN FACT, IN THE FAR FUTURE,
A.I.  WILL BLOW PAST US

30:28.827 --> 30:31.030
LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.365
FUTURISTS CALL THE
MOMENT THAT SUPER-INTELLIGENT

30:33.399 --> 30:35.868
MACHINES BECOME THE
ALPHA RACE ON THE PLANET,

30:35.902 --> 30:38.670
AND BEGIN TO FUNCTION
BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.073
THE SINGULARITY.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.511
LOUIS ROSENBERG: SINGULARITY
IS THE POINT WHERE A CONSCIOUS

30:45.544 --> 30:47.379
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
IS CREATED,

30:47.413 --> 30:49.748
AND IT'S SMARTER THAN PEOPLE.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.984
PETER DIAMANDIS:
IT'LL LEAVE US IN THE DUST,

30:52.018 --> 30:54.153
IT'LL BE THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US HUMANS AND BACTERIA

30:54.186 --> 30:55.654
IN THE SOIL.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.389
MICHAEL GRAZIANO: THE
SINGULARITY IS AN EVENT

30:57.423 --> 30:59.391
HORIZON THAT YOU
CAN'T SEE BEYOND,

30:59.425 --> 31:01.327
AND THE IDEA IS THAT
TECHNOLOGY IS SO

31:01.360 --> 31:03.829
TRANSFORMATIVE THAT WE ON ONE
SIDE OF IT CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT

31:03.862 --> 31:05.864
THE OTHER SIDE WOULD BE LIKE.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.400
PETER DIAMANTIS:
A.I. IS EVERY SUCCESSIVE

31:08.434 --> 31:10.536
GENERATION HAS LEARNED
EVERYTHING THE GENERATION

31:10.569 --> 31:14.073
BEFORE HAS LEARNED
AND SO THERE'S THIS RAPID

31:14.106 --> 31:17.676
EXPONENTIAL GROWTH IN
CAPABILITIES AND KNOWLEDGE

31:17.709 --> 31:20.879
THAT IS ALMOST UNFATHOMABLE.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.715
NEGIN FARSAD: IT'S A
TOTAL PARADIGM SHIFT.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.918
IT'S NOT THE WAY THAT WE
UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT NOW.

31:25.952 --> 31:28.220
LIKE, PEOPLE PROBABLY
DON'T EVEN WEAR SWEATPANTS.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.390
BUT IT'S MORE OF LIKE AN
IDEA OF THIS FUTURE TIME THAT,

31:31.423 --> 31:34.093
YOU KNOW, THAT IS
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,

31:34.560 --> 31:37.129
OTHERWORLDLY FROM WHAT
WE UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.767
NARRATOR: WHEN THE
SINGULARITY ARRIVES, A.I.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.570
WILL NOT JUST GROW OUR
FOOD AND DO OUR LAUNDRY.

31:45.571 --> 31:48.907
THEY WON'T JUST DO OUR
TAXES AND LEGISLATE OUR LAWS.

31:48.941 --> 31:51.978
THEY'LL THINK AND
DREAM AND CREATE.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.380
GEORGE DVORSKY: I MEAN,
IT'S OFTEN BEEN SAID THAT

31:54.413 --> 31:56.215
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
WILL BE THE LAST INVENTION

31:56.248 --> 31:57.716
WE EVER HAVE TO MAKE.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.452
BECAUSE, FROM THERE ON IN,
IT'S GOING TO TAKE OVER.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.590
NARRATOR: SO ONCE AN A.I.
LOOKS LESS LIKE A TINKERTOY,

32:04.923 --> 32:06.892
HAS SMARTS BEYOND BELIEF,

32:06.925 --> 32:10.062
AND A FULLY-DEVELOPED SENSE OF
SELF WITH THE SOCIAL SKILLS OF

32:10.096 --> 32:12.664
GEORGE CLOONEY, WHAT MAKES
IT DIFFERENT FROM YOU OR ME?

32:14.266 --> 32:16.135
THAT'S WHERE THINGS
COULD GET A LITTLE HAIRY.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.639
A.I. JUST MIGHT HELP YOU
DO THINGS THAT YOU COULDN'T

32:20.672 --> 32:23.509
DO WITHOUT A SENTIENT
SUPER-COMPUTER BY YOUR SIDE.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.079
BUT WHAT IF YOUR A.I.
FRIEND DECIDES IT WANTS

32:27.113 --> 32:29.281
TO KILL YOU?

32:36.122 --> 32:38.290
NARRATOR: ODDS ARE THAT
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL

32:38.324 --> 32:41.160
GET PRETTY DAMNED
EVOLVED, SO MUCH SO,

32:41.193 --> 32:43.262
THAT THEY'LL HAVE
SUPERINTELLIGENCE THAT FAR

32:43.295 --> 32:45.464
SURPASSES OURS.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.100
IT COULD BE THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO

32:48.134 --> 32:50.936
HUMANITY: THEY'LL FREE
US FROM MENIAL LABOR,

32:50.969 --> 32:53.205
HELP US PROCESS INFORMATION
LIKE NEVER BEFORE,

32:53.872 --> 32:56.275
HELP US ACHIEVE LEVELS
OF THOUGHT AND SCIENTIFIC

32:56.308 --> 32:58.644
EXPLORATION THAT WOULD NEVER
BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THEM.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.615
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THEY MIGHT CHALLENGE US FOR

33:03.649 --> 33:05.484
DOMINANCE AT THE
TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.620
LET'S START WITH
OPTION NUMBER 2 FIRST.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.123
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MACHINES
WE'VE CREATED DECIDE THAT

33:11.157 --> 33:13.325
THEY'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT US?

33:16.062 --> 33:19.165
ERIC HORVITZ: THINK ABOUT
WORST CASE SCENARIOS.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.469
A MACHINE OUTWITS HUMANS IN
A WAY THAT CAN'T BE STOPPED.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.703
RUNNING AMOK.

33:24.736 --> 33:27.039
PROVIDING A THREAT TO
THE SURVIVAL OF HUMANITY.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.707
LET'S GO THERE.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.481
MICHIO KAKU: I THINK BY
THE END OF THE CENTURY,

33:35.514 --> 33:36.982
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE ROBOTS
THAT ARE SELF-AWARE,

33:37.015 --> 33:38.484
TO A DEGREE.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.686
AND AT THAT POINT, WE SHOULD
PUT A CHIP IN THEIR BRAIN TO

33:40.719 --> 33:43.389
SHUT THEM OFF IF THEY
HAVE MURDEROUS THOUGHTS.

33:43.422 --> 33:45.991
'CAUSE AT THAT POINT,
THEY COULD BECOME INDEPENDENT

33:46.024 --> 33:48.427
OF OUR WISHES.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.398
SYD MEAD: IF WE LOSE CONTROL
OF THE ROBOTS AND THEY START

33:52.431 --> 33:54.666
MAKING MORE ROBOTS WHICH
ARE SMARTER THAN THE ROBOTS

33:54.700 --> 33:57.369
THAT MADE THE ROBOTS,
WE MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE.

33:58.237 --> 33:59.838
MATT MIRA: I THINK THAT'S
THE MOMENT WHERE WE SHOULD

33:59.871 --> 34:02.241
ALL HEAD FOR THE HILLS.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.710
AND NOT, AND NOT, WHEN
WE'RE HEADING FOR THE HILLS,

34:04.743 --> 34:07.613
DON'T USE WAZE OR GOOGLE
MAPS TO GET THERE,

34:08.614 --> 34:11.517
'CAUSE THE MACHINES WILL KNOW.

34:11.550 --> 34:15.187
NARRATOR: SCI-FI HAS IMAGINED
THE SCENARIO OF WHAT HAPPENS

34:15.221 --> 34:17.523
WHEN THE MACHINES BELIEVE
THEY KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR US,

34:17.556 --> 34:19.758
AND IT'S UNSETTLING.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.363
JON SPAITHS: IN 2001, YOU
GET, PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS

34:24.396 --> 34:27.699
EXAMPLE OF A COMPUTER DECIDING
IT DOESN'T WANT EVERYTHING

34:27.733 --> 34:30.035
THAT ITS MAKERS WANTED.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.604
AND IT BEGINS TO
HAVE HUMAN WILL.

34:32.638 --> 34:36.375
DAVE BOWMAN: OPEN THE
POD BAY DOORS, HAL.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.043
HAL: I'M SORRY DAVE.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.147
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT.

34:42.281 --> 34:44.416
CHARLES SOULE: THE
DANGER IS YOU'VE GOT ONE OF

34:44.450 --> 34:46.552
THESE ROBOTS, THESE A.I.'S
THESE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCES,

34:46.585 --> 34:48.720
WHO JUST THINKS, WELL,
I, I BET I CAN DO THIS A

34:48.754 --> 34:50.389
LITTLE BIT BETTER.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.557
I BET I, I BET I COULD TAKE
CARE OF THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE

34:51.590 --> 34:52.924
SMOOTHLY THAN THESE GUYS.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.893
LIKE THESE ARE JUST,
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE MORONS.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.562
LOOK AT, LOOK AT THIS.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.631
MATT MIRA: I'VE SEEN TOO MANY
MOVIES WHERE MACHINES BECOME

34:59.665 --> 35:02.601
SELF-AWARE, AND
WHAT DO THEY DO?

35:02.934 --> 35:04.270
THEY RISE UP AGAINST
THEIR CAPTORS.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.304
WHO'S THEIR CAPTORS?

35:05.337 --> 35:07.239
US.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.641
WE'RE IN BAD SHAPE IF THE
SINGULARITY HAPPENS, GUYS.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.610
EVERYONE RUN.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.279
NARRATOR: THAT'S
ONE POSSIBILITY,

35:13.312 --> 35:15.781
THAT THE ROBOTS
WANT TO DESTROY US.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.350
IT COULD ALSO GO IN A
LESS TROUBLING DIRECTION,

35:18.984 --> 35:21.353
BUT ONE THAT BRINGS UP
A LOT OF ETHICAL QUESTIONS.

35:22.488 --> 35:26.325
A.I. MIGHT JUST WANT
TO EXIST ALONGSIDE US.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.628
IMAGINE A FUTURE WHEN A
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT

35:29.661 --> 35:32.931
GRANTING EQUAL RIGHTS TO
ALL ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT

35:32.964 --> 35:35.133
BEINGS IS DEBATED
ON THE SENATE FLOOR.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.102
HOW WOULD YOU REACT?

35:37.135 --> 35:38.970
OSCAR: JESS?

35:39.004 --> 35:41.106
JESS: OKAY, YOU'RE
GONNA BE FINE, HONEY.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.642
OKAY, YOU'RE
DOING REALLY GOOD.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.344
SO BRAVE!

35:45.377 --> 35:46.945
[BONE SNAPPING].

35:46.978 --> 35:48.314
MOTHER: WHAT HAPPENED?

35:48.347 --> 35:50.649
JESS: OH, UH SHE
DISLOCATED HER WRIST.

35:50.682 --> 35:53.151
OSCAR: IT'S OKAY,
SHE FIXED IT.

35:53.185 --> 35:57.823
MOTHER: WOW, THANK
YOU, ARE YOU A DOCTOR?

35:58.824 --> 36:01.393
JESS: NO.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.329
PARENT: GET AWAY
FROM MY DAUGHTER.

36:03.362 --> 36:04.463
OSCAR: SHE WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.465
MOTHER: YOU MEAN, "IT!"

36:06.498 --> 36:07.633
OSCAR: LOOK JUST
BECAUSE SHE'S AN A.I.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.368
MOTHER: IF YOU WANT TO
HAVE ONE THAT'S FINE!

36:09.401 --> 36:11.670
JUST KEEP IT AWAY
FROM MY CHILD.

36:20.011 --> 36:23.482
NARRATOR: IT'S ONLY NATURAL,
THIS MOTHER IS PROTECTIVE.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.684
SHE FEARS WHAT SHE
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

36:28.053 --> 36:31.223
BRIAN GREENE: THERE'S A WHOLE
PANDORA'S BOX OF DIFFICULT,

36:31.257 --> 36:34.025
ETHICAL ISSUES THAT ARISE.

36:34.059 --> 36:37.863
DOES THAT THINKING MACHINE
HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS THAT WE

36:37.896 --> 36:40.399
AFFORD TO HUMAN BEINGS?

36:41.367 --> 36:43.669
DOES THAT THINKING MACHINE
DESERVE A CERTAIN KIND OF

36:43.702 --> 36:46.071
AUTONOMY, EVEN THOUGH WE
CREATED THAT THINKING MACHINE?

36:48.073 --> 36:50.008
NARRATOR: HUMANS PROBABLY
WON'T BE TOO KEEN TO GIVE UP

36:50.041 --> 36:52.210
THEIR ALPHA DOG
STATUS ON EARTH.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.380
THING IS, WE MAY
NOT HAVE A CHOICE,

36:55.381 --> 36:57.916
WHEN DEALING WITH
BEINGS SMARTER AND STRONGER

36:57.949 --> 36:59.385
THAN WE ARE.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.919
THE QUESTION IS,

37:00.952 --> 37:04.723
DO HUMAN-LIKE ROBOTS
DESERVE EQUAL RIGHTS?

37:06.592 --> 37:08.394
ROSE EVELETH: WE GET INTO
THIS WEIRD ETHICAL TERRITORY

37:08.427 --> 37:10.195
BECAUSE WE KNOW A
MACHINE'S NOT A HUMAN.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.697
IS IT MORE LIKE A DOG?

37:11.730 --> 37:13.699
DOGS HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS,
PETS HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.233
SO IF I COME INTO YOUR
HOUSE AND I KILL YOUR DOG,

37:15.267 --> 37:17.603
WHICH I WOULD NEVER
DO, PEOPLE WOULD SAY,

37:17.636 --> 37:20.071
"WELL THAT'S NOT RIGHT
BECAUSE MY DOG IS A LIVING BEING

37:20.105 --> 37:23.609
AND IT HAS CONSCIOUSNESS
OF SOME KIND."

37:23.642 --> 37:27.078
I THINK THAT MACHINES WILL
GET SOME KINDS OF RIGHTS.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.583
GEORGE DVORSKY: MY OWN HOPE
IS THAT WE DO RECOGNIZE THESE

37:31.617 --> 37:34.386
ENTITIES AS BEING PERSONS
DESERVING OF RIGHTS AND THAT

37:34.420 --> 37:35.621
WE WILL TREAT
THEM ACCORDINGLY,

37:35.654 --> 37:36.788
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:36.822 --> 37:38.390
AND YOU KNOW, WE
TREAT THEM WELL,

37:38.424 --> 37:40.225
THEN PERHAPS THEY'RE GOING
TO TREAT US WELL IN RETURN.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.294
NARRATOR: IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT A.I. MAY JUST TAKE THE

37:42.328 --> 37:43.795
POWER IT WANTS.

37:43.829 --> 37:46.097
IT'LL CERTAINLY HAVE
THE SKILLS FOR IT.

37:46.131 --> 37:48.634
THAT MEANS THAT THE FUTURE
COULD BE A WORLD WHERE ROBOTS

37:48.667 --> 37:50.602
ARE NO LONGER WORKING FOR US,

37:50.636 --> 37:53.639
BUT WILL HAVE THE
SAME STATUS AS HUMANS.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.679
ROBOT: PARDON ME, BUT
THERE'S BREAKING NEWS.

38:02.147 --> 38:04.616
OSCAR: OKAY, GO AHEAD.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.785
NEWS ANCHOR:
GOOD EVENING EVERYONE.

38:06.818 --> 38:09.421
IN THE LAST HOUR LEGISLATION
GRANTING FULL PERSONHOOD TO

38:09.455 --> 38:12.157
MEMBERS OF THE ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS

38:12.190 --> 38:14.426
SWEPT THROUGH THE UNITED
NATIONS GOVERNING BODY WITH

38:14.460 --> 38:16.428
NEAR TOTAL SUPPORT.

38:16.462 --> 38:19.097
WHILE PROTESTS CONTINUE, THIS
IS A TRULY HISTORIC MOMENT FOR

38:19.130 --> 38:21.800
INDIVIDUALS OF BIOLOGICAL AND
TECHNOLOGICAL ORIGIN ALIKE,

38:22.801 --> 38:25.203
AND THE BEGINNING OF A
NEW CHAPTER FOR MANKIND.

38:27.706 --> 38:28.940
OSCAR: IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME.

38:28.974 --> 38:31.309
EVA: JESS YOU GOTTA HEAR THIS!

38:32.544 --> 38:34.346
JESS: I HEARD.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.815
EVA: WHAT?

38:36.848 --> 38:38.316
JESS.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.018
JESS: I HAVE RIGHTS,
WHICH MEANS THAT I

38:40.051 --> 38:41.653
ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.155
PEOPLE WILL FINALLY
LET ME HELP THEM.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.028
NARRATOR: HAVING
EXTRAORDINARY POWERS MAKES

38:50.061 --> 38:53.399
THIS A.I. DAUGHTER FEEL
OBLIGATED TO HELP HUMANS.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.835
BUT IS THERE REALLY THAT
WIDE A GULF BETWEEN HER AND US?

39:13.719 --> 39:16.888
MATT MIRA: I MEAN,
WHAT DEFINES HUMANITY?

39:16.922 --> 39:19.491
YOU KNOW, IN THE STAR TREK
EPISODE, MEASURE OF A MAN,

39:19.525 --> 39:21.527
WHERE DATA WAS PUT ON TRIAL
TO SEE IF HE WAS PROPERTY OF

39:21.560 --> 39:24.262
STARFLEET OR A
REALIZED INDIVIDUAL,

39:25.397 --> 39:28.734
PICARD HAD TO ARGUE FOR
HIM BEING AN INDIVIDUAL.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.169
CAPTAIN PICARD: NOW THE
DECISION YOU REACH TODAY WILL

39:31.202 --> 39:34.706
DETERMINE HOW WE WILL REGARD
THIS CREATION OF OUR GENIUS.

39:35.907 --> 39:38.009
MATT MIRA: I THINK IF YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF

39:38.043 --> 39:40.178
LEGISLATURE THAT'S GOING TO
HAVE TO COME DOWN FOR WHAT TO

39:40.211 --> 39:44.082
DO WITH THESE ARTIFICIALLY
BORN BEINGS AND WHAT TO DO

39:44.115 --> 39:49.020
WITH THEIR RIGHTS AND
PRIVILEGES AND IT'S A CAN OF

39:49.054 --> 39:51.089
WORMS I'M GLAD I
DON'T HAVE TO OPEN.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.693
NARRATOR: A RACE OF A.I.
ROBOTS COULD VERY WELL

39:54.726 --> 39:57.095
DECIDE THEY WANT
TO SEIZE POWER,

39:57.128 --> 40:00.198
OVERTHROW HUMANITY,
AND THEN THEY WILL INHERIT

40:00.231 --> 40:02.233
THE EARTH AND BEYOND.

40:03.735 --> 40:07.573
BUT THERE IS A SLIGHTLY
MORE OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO.

40:13.979 --> 40:16.748
WILL A.I. CHANGE WHAT
IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN?

40:17.749 --> 40:19.451
WHAT IF A.I.
SIMPLY BECOMES A NEW,

40:19.485 --> 40:21.587
IMPROVED VERSION OF HUMANITY,

40:21.620 --> 40:23.789
AND THEY INSPIRE US?

40:32.097 --> 40:34.399
NARRATOR: ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE THAT IS SMARTER

40:34.432 --> 40:37.302
THAN ALL OF MENSA COMBINED
IS A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.972
IT'S THE SINGULARITY,
AND IT'S OUR FUTURE.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.580
AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A.I.
WILL DECIDE THEY WANT US GONE.

40:48.614 --> 40:52.283
SURE, IT'S TERRIFYING AND
IT SELLS MOVIE TICKETS.

40:52.317 --> 40:55.821
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER, MORE
OPTIMISTIC POSSIBILITY.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.989
BRIAN GREENE: IT'S
MIND-BOGGLING AND THRILLING TO

40:58.023 --> 41:01.593
IMAGINE WHAT ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE COULD DO, RIGHT.

41:01.627 --> 41:06.131
I MEAN, WE STRUGGLE SO HARD TO
SOLVE DEEP PROBLEMS ABOUT THE

41:06.164 --> 41:07.999
EARTH, THE UNIVERSE.

41:09.034 --> 41:13.939
AND IMAGINE THAT WE COULD
TRANSFER THOSE ENIGMAS TO A

41:13.972 --> 41:17.943
MORE POWERFUL THINKING
ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD SOLVE

41:17.976 --> 41:22.113
THESE PROBLEMS, OR REVEAL NEW
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'VE NEVER

41:22.147 --> 41:25.884
THOUGHT OF, AND CREATIVE IDEAS
THAT WE THEN COULD PURSUE.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.023
NARRATOR: IN THIS VISION
OF THE FUTURE, A.I.

41:32.057 --> 41:35.527
WILL NOT ONLY LIVE
ALONGSIDE US AS PARTNERS,

41:35.561 --> 41:39.064
HUMANS WILL ALSO RETAIN
CONTROL OVER THE MACHINES.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.634
CHUCK NICE: MAYBE WHAT
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO IS REMOVE

41:42.668 --> 41:44.803
THE CONSCIOUSNESS
THAT IS NEGATIVE,

41:44.836 --> 41:48.139
REMOVE THE STRINGS OF
CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ARE WHAT

41:48.173 --> 41:50.909
WE WOULD CALL EVIL, HARMFUL.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.978
NARRATOR: IF
A.I. IS BENIGN,

41:53.011 --> 41:55.180
THEN THAT ARTIFICIALLY
INTELLIGENT DAUGHTER MAY BE

41:55.213 --> 41:57.215
A REALITY IN OUR FUTURE.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.851
AND SHE MAY HAVE NEW
INSPIRATIONS FOR HER SO-CALLED

41:59.885 --> 42:02.554
LIFE THAT WE'LL HAVE
TO KEEP UP WITH.

42:04.089 --> 42:06.858
OSCAR: WOULD YOU PASS
ME THE, YEAH, THANKS.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.662
JESS: YOU KNOW, IT'S CRAZY
HOW MUCH OF THIS HE GOT RIGHT?

42:10.696 --> 42:12.898
LIKE, SPACE
TRAVEL, SUBMARINES.

42:12.931 --> 42:16.267
OSCAR: HE ALSO GOT JUST AS
MUCH STUFF WRONG THOUGH.

42:17.703 --> 42:19.671
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST HELD
YOU IN MY ARMS WHEN YOU WERE

42:19.705 --> 42:22.908
BORN, I NEVER COULD HAVE
IMAGINED WHAT KIND OF WORLD WE

42:22.941 --> 42:24.843
WOULD LIVE IN.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.545
JESS: ARE YOU SORRY?

42:27.579 --> 42:29.781
SORRY THAT MOM
BROUGHT ME BACK?

42:30.916 --> 42:33.184
I'M ARTIFICIAL?

42:33.218 --> 42:35.420
OSCAR: NO, ALL ANY PARENT
WANTS IS FOR THEIR CHILD TO

42:35.453 --> 42:37.723
EXPLORE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.

42:37.756 --> 42:40.258
AND YOU HAVE MORE EXPLORING
TO DO THAN ANY KID I KNOW.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.195
NARRATOR: YOUR A.I.
DAUGHTER MIGHT BE JUST LIKE

42:44.229 --> 42:45.764
YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD,

42:45.797 --> 42:49.601
BUT SHE'LL HAVE ABILITIES
BEYOND ANYTHING BIOLOGICAL.

42:49.635 --> 42:51.737
WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE
IS THE MOST OPTIMISTIC

42:51.770 --> 42:53.705
FUTURE PATH OF A.I.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.540
MAYBE THEY'LL BE
SMART, GOOD COMPANY

42:55.573 --> 42:57.042
AND THEY'LL LIKE US.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.543
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
BE SURE WE PROGRAM

42:58.576 --> 43:00.779
OUR A.I. CAREFULLY.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.082
JON SPAITHS: THERE IS ONE SCHOOL
OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT

43:04.115 --> 43:07.585
SAYS, IF YOU MAKE THE ROBOT
NEED TO REST OCCASIONALLY,

43:07.619 --> 43:11.056
IF YOU MAKE
THE ROBOT LOSE ITS TRAIN OF

43:11.089 --> 43:14.459
THOUGHT OCCASIONALLY, IT
MAY IDENTIFY WITH US MORE,

43:14.492 --> 43:18.463
IT MAY THINK MORE LIKE
US, IT MAY BE MORE LOYAL.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.099
NARRATOR: AND EVEN MORE
THAN THAT, MAYBE A.I.

43:21.132 --> 43:25.103
WILL WORK WITH US TO ENABLE
HUMANITY TO DO ITS BEST WORK.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.575
GEORGE DVORSKY: ONCE A.I.
BECOMES MORE SOPHISTICATED

43:30.608 --> 43:32.310
THEN WE CAN START
TO COLLABORATE WITH IT

43:32.343 --> 43:34.946
AT A VERY INTERESTING
AND A VERY PROFOUND LEVEL.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.282
BARATUNDE THURSTON: WHEN A
NEW TYPE OF CREATIVITY COME,

43:37.315 --> 43:39.417
AND THE COLLABORATION
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.986
SO THAT'S EMPOWERING.

43:41.019 --> 43:43.989
I DON'T THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY
IS ALWAYS A THREAT, OR,

43:44.022 --> 43:45.757
OR A REDUCTION.

43:45.791 --> 43:49.127
I THINK IT CAN ADD AND
BOLSTER CREATIVITY AS WELL.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.596
SO ART WILL BE AFFECTED
SOMETIMES IN REALLY

43:51.629 --> 43:53.699
UNPREDICTABLY BEAUTIFUL WAYS.

43:54.632 --> 43:57.669
CHUCK NICE: IT'S GOING TO FREE
US UP TO DO WHAT WE DO BEST

43:57.703 --> 44:01.006
WHICH IS DREAM AND CREATE
AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING

44:01.039 --> 44:04.542
EVEN BIGGER AND BETTER
THAN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.612
NARRATOR: THEN THERE'S THE
POSSIBILITY THAT WE'LL TAKE

44:07.645 --> 44:09.681
A PAGE FROM A.I.'S BOOK:

44:09.715 --> 44:12.317
WE'LL BECOME PART
COMPUTER OURSELVES.

44:14.052 --> 44:16.955
JON SPAITHS: IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT WE WILL BEGIN TO

44:16.988 --> 44:19.290
HYBRIDIZE OURSELVES.

44:19.324 --> 44:20.826
THAT IS A FORK IN THE ROAD.

44:20.859 --> 44:24.629
THAT'S A DEPARTURE,
NOT JUST AN EXTENSION OF

44:24.662 --> 44:26.197
THE HUMAN MODEL.

44:26.231 --> 44:28.900
THE INVENTION OF A NEW
DEFINITION OF A HUMAN BEING.

44:31.002 --> 44:34.305
PETER DIAMANDIS: WE ARE ABOUT
TO GO FROM HUMANS ALONE,

44:34.339 --> 44:37.008
TO HUMANS ENABLED
BY COMPUTATION.

44:38.576 --> 44:42.147
SORT OF HOP ON TOP OF THIS
EXPONENTIAL GROWTH PATH.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.149
BARATUNDE THURSTON: NO PROBLEM
AT ALL WITH THE MERGING WITH

44:44.182 --> 44:46.651
MACHINE'S TECHNOLOGY SCENARIO.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.520
NOTHING TO SEE HERE FOLKS,
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

44:50.255 --> 44:53.391
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THAT
COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG BY US

44:53.424 --> 44:55.593
MERGING WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.496
EDWARD BOYDEN: PERHAPS A THIRD
OF A MILLION PATIENTS HAVE HAD

44:58.529 --> 45:00.531
SOME SORT OF NEURAL IMPLANT
PUT INTO THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM

45:00.565 --> 45:02.667
TO HELP PEOPLE WITH
DEMENTIA OR ALZHEIMER'S,

45:02.700 --> 45:04.569
OR OTHER KINDS OF CONDITIONS.

45:04.602 --> 45:06.838
OVER TIME, THEIR
USE WILL BROADEN,

45:06.872 --> 45:08.539
COMPLEX FUNCTIONS
LIKE INTELLIGENCE,

45:08.573 --> 45:11.376
OR MEMORY COULD BE
AUGMENTED IN REAL TIME.

45:11.877 --> 45:14.345
MATT MIRA: IF WE ARE
TO MERGE WITH A.I. WHAT

45:14.379 --> 45:16.414
FORM WILL THAT TAKE?

45:17.615 --> 45:19.517
NARRATOR: A NEW
MODEL FOR HUMANITY,

45:19.550 --> 45:21.853
NO LONGER PURELY BIOLOGICAL,

45:21.887 --> 45:24.455
WE MAY BE SOON
A SPECIES OF CYBORGS.

45:25.623 --> 45:29.227
NOW WE WON'T HAVE TO RELY
ON THE LUCK OF GENETICS:

45:29.260 --> 45:32.230
WE COULD DECIDE WHAT KIND
OF HUMANS WE WANT TO BE.

45:35.566 --> 45:36.935
EVA: NOTHING TOO DRASTIC.

45:36.968 --> 45:38.269
JESS: OF COURSE.

45:38.303 --> 45:40.906
EVA: HALF MY OFFICE NOW HAS
NANOBOTS IN THEIR BRAINS.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.875
AND THE OTHER HALF ARE A.I.

45:43.909 --> 45:45.944
I GOTTA DO IT JUST TO KEEP UP.

45:45.977 --> 45:47.712
WHY SHOULDN'T I ANALYZE
GENOMES IN MY SLEEP LIKE

45:47.745 --> 45:49.380
EVERYONE ELSE?

45:49.414 --> 45:52.217
JESS: YOU READY?

45:52.250 --> 45:55.921
EVA: UHH, YEAH, MMM-HMM.

46:03.594 --> 46:05.897
NARRATOR: HUMANKIND'S NEXT
STEP REALLY MIGHT BE THIS EASY,

46:05.931 --> 46:08.299
JUST A SIMPLE INJECTION
OF INFINITESIMAL MEDICAL

46:08.333 --> 46:10.802
ROBOTS INTO OUR BLOODSTREAM.

46:11.269 --> 46:12.403
HOD LIPSON: AT THAT
POINT, ARE WE STILL HUMAN?

46:12.437 --> 46:14.305
OR ARE WE PURE A.I.?

46:14.339 --> 46:17.809
IT COULD BE A BLURRY SORT OF
DISTINCTION AND MAYBE IT'S

46:17.843 --> 46:19.845
BEST TO LEAVE IT THAT WAY.

46:23.181 --> 46:24.916
NARRATOR: WHAT ISN'T
BLURRY IS THAT A.I. WILL

46:24.950 --> 46:28.086
FUEL ALL FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES,

46:28.119 --> 46:31.622
WRAP YOUR MIND AROUND THIS:
MANY SCIENTISTS BELIEVE

46:31.656 --> 46:33.624
IN THE FUTURE
WE WILL WORK WITH A.I.

46:33.658 --> 46:36.828
TO EVOLVE OUT OF OUR
BIOLOGICAL BODIES.

46:37.795 --> 46:41.132
WE'LL EXIST ONLY AS A
DIGITAL SIGNAL IN A STRUCTURE

46:41.166 --> 46:45.303
CALLED THE DYSON'S SPHERE,
A GIANT SUPER-COMPUTER

46:45.336 --> 46:47.772
POWERED BY THE
SUN WHERE WE CAN BE

46:47.805 --> 46:50.141
EVERYWHERE AND NOWHERE.

46:51.542 --> 46:54.145
BUT BEFORE THAT SCIENTISTS
WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

46:54.179 --> 46:56.814
HOW TO MAKE HUMANS
LIVE FOREVER.

46:57.215 --> 46:59.284
COMING YOUR WAY NEXT,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU

46:59.317 --> 47:01.219
NEVER HAD TO DIE?
