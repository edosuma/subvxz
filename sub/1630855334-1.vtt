WEBVTT

01:32.860 --> 01:35.263
Five more
minutes, Computer.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.934
Warning, ship
entering a meteor shower.

01:44.037 --> 01:44.838
What?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.908
Computer, repeat.

01:47.908 --> 01:50.744
Warning, ship
entering a meteor shower.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.647
A meteor shower?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.583
That's what I said.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.451
Perhaps a visit to
the ship's infirmary

01:57.451 --> 01:59.253
for a hearing test is needed.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.622
My ears
are fine, Computer.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.493
Whoa, so are my eyes!

02:05.493 --> 02:07.428
Computer, take evasive action.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.308
Warning,
critical hit.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.777
Oh, what are we gonna do?

02:23.777 --> 02:26.079
I have
initiated wake up protocol.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.015
Wait, no, don't
wake up the captain.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.219
And why not?

02:33.421 --> 02:36.224
Captain Ace, Arcee!

02:36.224 --> 02:37.858
You're awake.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.092
What's going on?

02:39.092 --> 02:40.694
Well, I was taking a quick nap

02:40.694 --> 02:43.664
and this media shower
came out of nowhere and...

02:43.664 --> 02:44.498
Oh.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.835
Arcee, can you get
us outta this mess?

02:47.835 --> 02:48.636
On it.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.741
I'm sorry, I really messed up.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.277
It's okay, Hex.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.411
We'll get through this.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.289
Look, a shooting star.

03:08.289 --> 03:11.158
Yeah, that's 'cause there's
a big meteor shower tonight.

03:12.426 --> 03:15.629
I know that, but
how did you know that?

03:15.629 --> 03:18.031
I may have taken a
peek at your star site.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.033
You did, did you?

03:20.033 --> 03:22.470
So this was planned?

03:22.470 --> 03:24.972
Well, I figured this
would be the perfect way

03:24.972 --> 03:28.008
to start our summer
in our new house.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.977
You are so sweet.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.083
Isn't this amazing, Sam?

03:37.885 --> 03:39.387
Wow.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.489
I haven't actually seen that
many stars in the sky before.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.624
That's 'cause you've
never been out of the city.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.361
Look, another shooting star!

03:47.361 --> 03:48.629
Make a wish, honey.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.897
Really?

03:49.897 --> 03:50.731
Of course.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.802
I wish that we could all
spend the summer back home

03:54.802 --> 03:55.603
in the city.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.274
Buddy, we're spending
the summer here

04:00.274 --> 04:02.676
so that your mom
can do her research.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.511
I know.

04:04.978 --> 04:09.617
I wish someone would empty
the trailer for me tomorrow.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.719
Mom, you said your wish,

04:11.719 --> 04:13.654
so now that one's
not gonna come true.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.324
Actually, bud, that
wish probably will.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.092
What's your wish, Dad?

04:20.428 --> 04:21.962
Not gonna tell you guys.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.698
Isn't this place the best?

04:26.033 --> 04:28.235
You know, I used to
come here growing up

04:28.235 --> 04:30.003
with Grandma and Grandpa,

04:30.003 --> 04:34.608
looking at these same stars
and exploring the woods.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.644
Dad, you don't go outside.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.046
I totally go outside.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.815
Okay, I'm going inside.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.150
The mosquitoes are biting.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.352
They're not biting me.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.555
Ow, all
right, I'm out.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.258
I told you this
was a bad idea.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.861
This is a great idea!

04:53.861 --> 04:56.096
Come on, Cassie, bedtime.

04:59.567 --> 05:03.003
I wish that I can
make some new friends.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.616
Whoa, just missed that one.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.786
Almost there.

05:18.786 --> 05:19.620
Come on.

05:22.790 --> 05:23.891
Yes!

05:23.891 --> 05:24.958
You did it!

05:28.462 --> 05:29.296
Watch out!

05:33.100 --> 05:35.268
Hex, thank you.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.404
Don't mention it.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.741
Oh, that's not good.

05:40.741 --> 05:44.111
All this damage caused an
explosion in the power core.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.213
Meaning?

05:46.213 --> 05:48.816
Meaning we are about to crash.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.619
Initiating
emergency landing protocol.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.020
Buckle yourselves in.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.755
I'm going to attempt
an emergency landing

05:54.755 --> 05:56.624
on that planet over there.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.326
Computer, can you gimme a
rundown on that planet please?

05:59.326 --> 06:01.061
Planet 2224.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.564
Third planet from
this system's sun,

06:03.564 --> 06:06.500
known to the
inhabitants as Earth.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.203
Population 7.8 billion
of these Earthlings.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.841
Did you just say
billion, with a B?

06:13.841 --> 06:15.075
Yes.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.910
Are you sure a hearing
test is not needed?

06:18.145 --> 06:19.780
Arcee, see what you can do

06:19.780 --> 06:22.215
about avoiding as many
Earthlings as you can.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.555
Entering
Earth's outer atmosphere.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.257
Brace for impact!

07:21.208 --> 07:22.910
This is it.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.011
They're here.

07:32.119 --> 07:32.953
Whoa.

09:07.748 --> 09:08.749
Come here.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.053
Just a little closer.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.154
Come to Papa.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.356
Gotcha!

09:17.758 --> 09:18.926
Whoa, whoa!

09:18.926 --> 09:21.428
Whoa, hey, are, are you okay?

09:21.428 --> 09:23.196
I'm fine.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.532
Marvin?

09:25.532 --> 09:27.200
Marvin Skerety?

09:27.200 --> 09:30.570
Hey, it's me,
John, John Griffin.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.239
Yes, yes, hello, John.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.274
Nice to see you.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.108
Here, here, let
me help you up.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.243
Nope, no, no.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.411
I'm, I'm, I'm fine, I'm fine.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.747
Thank you.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.948
Yeah, sure.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.582
Well, at least let
me grab your, your...

09:42.582 --> 09:43.784
No, no, no.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.853
I, I can get it myself.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.927
Actually, I, I do think
I need some help up.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.763
Yeah, yeah, of
course, of course.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.365
Thank you, thank you.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.801
So, how are you?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.903
Fine, fine.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.705
When did, when did
you get back in town?

10:04.705 --> 10:05.538
Last night.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.708
We're here for the summer.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.542
Avery, you remember
my wife Avery?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.881
She's here doing some of
her star map documentation.

10:13.881 --> 10:17.084
Obviously, as you know, the
skies here are perfect for that.

10:17.084 --> 10:17.951
Yes.

10:17.951 --> 10:18.986
Yes, yes.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.755
Well, well, welcome back, John.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.190
I must, I must be going.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.094
I see you're still doing
your, your alien thing.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.999
It's called ufology, okay?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.333
And it's a real thing.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.567
Yeah, of course, of course.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.469
I'm, I'm happy for you.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.106
I, it was great to see you.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.241
We should, we should
get together sometime.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.711
Not sure I can.

10:43.711 --> 10:44.845
I'm very busy.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.279
I got a big lead.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.816
Very, very, very
top, top secret.

10:50.017 --> 10:50.818
Oh.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.420
Tell Avery I said hello.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.589
Yeah, will do.

10:57.590 --> 10:58.558
Take care, Marvin.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.563
Good old Marvin the Martian.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.276
Emergency
power initiated.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.651
Are we dead?

11:26.086 --> 11:28.789
It doesn't look like it.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.324
You have
successfully landed on Earth.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.395
Your definition of
successful is very different

11:35.395 --> 11:36.897
than mine, Computer.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.131
Damage report.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.700
Significant
damages detected.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.335
Hex, what can you make of it?

11:43.470 --> 11:47.174
Well, we aren't
getting home like this.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.243
But you can fix it, right?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.544
Of course.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.046
Great.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.683
After we collect all the parts
that fell off during entry.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.186
Uh, what parts?

11:59.186 --> 12:00.120
These parts.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.925
And thankfully, they aren't
too far away from this area.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.095
Well, let's go get 'em.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.596
Aye, aye, Captain.

12:11.198 --> 12:15.836
Um, Hex, you probably
shouldn't go out there

12:15.836 --> 12:17.170
looking like you do.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.506
And why not?

12:19.506 --> 12:23.076
We don't know if this
planet is friendly.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.311
She's right.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.213
This planet isn't a part
of the explored areas

12:26.213 --> 12:27.580
of the Alliance.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.051
Computer, what do
Earthlings think of aliens?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.219
Searching.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.455
Running research now.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.237
We're gonna end up
someone's science experiment!

12:50.237 --> 12:52.572
Okay, calm down.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.374
We can figure this out.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.608
How?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.378
This planet doesn't
exactly welcome aliens.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.947
What if we weren't aliens?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.382
Say what now?

13:02.382 --> 13:05.252
Computer, is the
morphing tube operational?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.054
Affirmative.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.689
We're gonna blend
in as something else.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.792
Ace, you're a genius!

13:12.792 --> 13:14.761
That's Captain Genius.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.231
We're too small to
pass as Earthlings.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.566
Computer, run a search

13:19.566 --> 13:21.568
on the creatures in
this sector, please.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.510
Wow, there's so many.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.081
What about those?

13:34.081 --> 13:35.782
Naked mole rats.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.151
Oh, they are so cute.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.154
Uh, no.

13:41.154 --> 13:45.325
Computer, what is this
region's most popular creature?

13:45.325 --> 13:48.028
Something cute and adorable.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.065
This region's
most popular creature is known

13:52.065 --> 13:55.135
as a dog or canine.

13:55.135 --> 13:58.105
Also known as man's best friend.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.472
Man's best friend?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.707
They're perfect.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.841
We'll change into them.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.099
Kids, breakfast!

14:29.269 --> 14:33.040
You guys are going
to love this food.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.441
Sandy's is the best.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.279
This is good.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.647
Don't talk with
your mouth full.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.849
Yeah, don't talk
with your mouth full.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.184
Don't encourage him.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.018
Fine.

14:46.920 --> 14:51.424
Oh, I have missed
Sandy's so much.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.625
Mom!

14:52.625 --> 14:54.861
Don't talk with your mouth full.

14:54.861 --> 14:55.695
Sorry.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.431
What do you guys
got going on today?

14:58.431 --> 14:59.432
Nothing.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.268
My phone is dead.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.203
Good, you can
take me exploring.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.204
Where?

15:04.204 --> 15:05.838
In the woods.

15:05.838 --> 15:06.673
That sounds fun.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.507
It does?

15:09.276 --> 15:10.677
Here, give this a shot.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.245
What's this?

15:12.245 --> 15:13.880
A solar powered charger?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.748
Yeah, well, with
the power out,

15:15.748 --> 15:17.684
figured this would
help charge your stuff.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.785
Cool.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.220
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.221
Wait for me!

15:23.190 --> 15:24.992
Is that really helpful?

15:24.992 --> 15:26.526
Baby steps.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.262
Plus, have you ever seen him
that excited to go outside?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.197
No.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.698
Oh, you know who I saw today?

15:31.698 --> 15:32.665
Who?

15:32.665 --> 15:33.500
Marvin.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.002
Yeah.

15:35.002 --> 15:38.071
Remember, the kids used to
call him Marvin the Martian?

15:38.071 --> 15:40.340
You used to call him that too.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.442
All right, maybe I did.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.276
Yeah.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.244
How's he doing?

15:44.244 --> 15:45.445
He's fine.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.547
He's still doing
the alien thing.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.349
Anyway, he said to say hi.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.450
Oh, that's so sweet.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.455
Oh, this is so good.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.865
Come on, Sam.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.635
Hang on, I'm trying to get
some sun to charge my stuff.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.470
But we have to go this way.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.039
What's that way?

16:12.039 --> 16:12.972
You'll see.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.648
Initiating.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.157
How do I look?

16:30.157 --> 16:31.758
Amazing.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.659
How do you feel?

16:33.826 --> 16:36.996
Furry, smaller,
and a little itchy.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.067
Your turn, Arcee.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.248
How's everything feel?

16:55.248 --> 16:56.583
Everything good?

16:57.450 --> 17:00.187
A little strange, but yeah.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.056
Whoa.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.124
Look at this tail!

17:05.192 --> 17:06.593
Ah, I can't stop wagging it.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.495
Cute.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.831
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.405
Yes.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.874
How about you keep
looking around?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.611
I'm gonna stay here for a
few minutes, charge my phone.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.279
Fine, but you're
gonna miss it.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.515
Don't go too far.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.885
Where are you?

17:35.688 --> 17:36.623
There you are.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.004
Are you sure you
don't need me to go too?

17:52.004 --> 17:54.641
I already have my
dog form picked out.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.343
I think it's better
that you stay here

17:56.343 --> 17:58.278
and continue to repair the ship.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.347
No one does it
better than you.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.814
You got it.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.550
Good luck, Hex.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.917
You too.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.353
All right, team, listen up.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.754
The quicker we can collect
the pieces we need,

18:07.754 --> 18:09.789
the quicker we can get home.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.890
All right, let's go.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.960
Watch out for Earthlings!

18:21.234 --> 18:22.068
Cassie!

18:26.339 --> 18:27.174
Earthling!

18:31.644 --> 18:32.479
Ow!

18:34.747 --> 18:35.582
Cassie?

18:40.187 --> 18:43.122
I have to say, I'm really
enjoying this dog form.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.757
Oh, watch this.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.058
- Woo!
- Hey.

18:46.058 --> 18:46.893
Sorry.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.397
Huh, that was interesting.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.231
Let me try.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.600
Wow!

18:53.600 --> 18:54.867
Woo-hoo!

18:54.867 --> 18:57.404
Great job.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.338
Hide.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.373
I found this over there.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.013
It's an Earthling child.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.381
What do we do?

19:08.381 --> 19:09.216
I don't know.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.049
Stay put.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.419
Maybe she can't see us.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.820
I can see your tails.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.491
Quick, what do
dogs sound like?

19:18.491 --> 19:19.426
I don't remember.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.028
Wait, I think I got it.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.063
Meow?

19:25.031 --> 19:29.336
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.870
Um, dogs don't meow.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.273
Oh.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.106
Moo.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.944
That's a cow.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.111
Ribbit?

19:39.111 --> 19:40.380
Frogs.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.214
Oh.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.783
You're an alien, aren't you?

19:43.783 --> 19:44.717
No.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.787
We are just highly trained dogs.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.822
I don't think so.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.725
Pretty sure she's
on to us, Ace.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.327
Maybe not.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.996
I saw your ship land last
night, but don't worry,

19:56.996 --> 19:58.531
your secret's safe with me.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.799
I'm Cassie.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.801
I'm Renkanavi Cion.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.003
But you can call me Arcee.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.273
Well, I guess there's no use

20:06.273 --> 20:07.774
in the charade any longer, huh?

20:07.774 --> 20:10.843
Captain Ace Beadlock
of the Briox Alliance.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.545
Nice to meet you.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.747
Just so you know,
dogs don't talk.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.316
They bark.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.917
Oh, that's right.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.486
Bark?

20:19.486 --> 20:21.020
I think this is yours.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.989
The flex ionizer?

20:22.989 --> 20:24.056
You found it?

20:34.534 --> 20:35.368
Whoa!

20:36.603 --> 20:38.037
Thank you.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.840
Well, at least we
recovered one of the pieces.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.009
Do you need help finding more?

20:43.009 --> 20:44.277
Yes.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.712
We lost several
pieces of our ship

20:45.712 --> 20:47.847
when we entered your
planet's atmosphere.

20:47.847 --> 20:51.117
We need to recover them
so we can return home.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.620
My brother and I
would love to help you.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.622
Your brother?

20:55.622 --> 20:56.789
Sibling unit, sir.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.325
Cassie?

20:58.325 --> 21:00.493
Yes, perhaps we could
keep our presence a secret

21:00.493 --> 21:01.728
from your brother.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.129
The less your kind knows
about us, the better.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.598
Okay, I won't tell him.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.799
Cassie, Cassie.

21:06.799 --> 21:07.734
Sam?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.536
Cassie, we are in danger.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.339
Why?

21:12.339 --> 21:14.341
Where did these
dogs come from?

21:14.341 --> 21:15.608
I found them in the forest.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.743
They're my new friends.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.746
Captain, Captain!

21:19.746 --> 21:21.280
An Earthling saw me!

21:21.280 --> 21:22.114
Hex?

21:24.751 --> 21:25.985
I mean, bark.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.225
Uh, oops.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.094
Is he dead?

21:35.094 --> 21:36.563
No.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.331
Well, what happened to him?

21:38.331 --> 21:40.299
I think he fainted.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.268
Fascinating.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.672
Do all Earthlings just
fall down like that?

21:45.672 --> 21:46.539
Sam?

21:46.539 --> 21:47.740
Sam, are you okay?

21:50.677 --> 21:52.111
What happened?

21:52.111 --> 21:53.546
You fainted.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.782
It was amazing.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.453
Oh, oh, is he gonna do it again?

22:00.453 --> 22:01.253
Hex.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.321
What?

22:03.289 --> 22:04.090
Aliens!

22:05.625 --> 22:08.027
Looks like the
cat's outta the bag.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.295
I thought we were dogs.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.264
I'm calling Mom and Dad.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.199
You can't.

22:13.199 --> 22:14.467
Why not?

22:14.467 --> 22:17.103
Because they're
our friends, Sam!

22:17.103 --> 22:19.271
How do you know that?

22:19.271 --> 22:20.707
It's true, Sam.

22:21.574 --> 22:22.809
We are friends.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.445
I'm Arcee and this is Ace.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.846
Captain Ace.

22:26.846 --> 22:27.680
I'm Hex.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.281
We met back at the ship.

22:29.281 --> 22:30.617
That was you?

22:30.617 --> 22:31.984
You look different.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.554
Yeah, that was my true form.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.490
We became dogs
to try to blend in.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.358
It's not working very well.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.960
They need our help.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.862
Help with what?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.531
To take over the world?

22:44.531 --> 22:45.832
No, no, nothing like that.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.000
Actually, a bunch of
pieces fell off our ship

22:48.000 --> 22:49.268
and we have to find them.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.903
Do you know where they are?

22:50.903 --> 22:52.439
Yes.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.674
Our collars are locked onto
their last known trajectories.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.812
Do you know
these locations?

22:59.812 --> 23:01.781
No, we just moved here.

23:01.781 --> 23:02.582
But hang on.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.220
Maybe if I...

23:09.288 --> 23:11.123
Yeah, there we go!

23:11.123 --> 23:13.760
It seems like a lot of
your pieces are close by.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.796
Two of them are
right by our house.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.198
Your house?

23:19.198 --> 23:21.100
As in your dwelling?

23:21.100 --> 23:22.034
Yeah.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.302
Yeah, do you wanna see it?

23:24.236 --> 23:26.138
Yeah, I would love to.

23:27.574 --> 23:31.010
We should probably keep them
outta sight of Mom and Dad.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.378
Mom and Dad?

23:32.378 --> 23:34.180
Parental units.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.048
No problem.

23:36.048 --> 23:39.552
I was the top of my class
in stealth abilities.

23:39.552 --> 23:42.889
I will be as quiet as a vop.

23:45.458 --> 23:48.160
It sounds like vops
aren't very quiet.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.429
That was my stomach.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.298
We haven't eaten
for several cycles.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.333
Oh.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.201
Sorry.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.435
That one was me.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.571
Mom can make us lunch.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.371
Let's go.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.417
Yeah, hello?

24:12.919 --> 24:13.920
Yes.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.754
Power's out.

24:19.726 --> 24:20.960
Oh, is that the power company?

24:20.960 --> 24:22.094
Yeah, I'm on hold.

24:22.094 --> 24:22.929
I've got lunch.

24:24.597 --> 24:25.431
Nice.

24:36.809 --> 24:37.744
Okay.

24:37.744 --> 24:38.778
It looks like Mom has some food.

24:38.778 --> 24:39.879
Great, I'm starving.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.782
You three stay
here in the garage.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.016
The garage?

24:44.016 --> 24:45.752
Yes, just try not
to touch anything.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.954
We'll bring you back
some food when we can.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.356
Sorry.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.391
We will anxiously
await your return.

24:56.428 --> 24:59.065
What do you think
all this stuff is for?

24:59.065 --> 25:02.969
I believe they are the
Earthlings' version of tools.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.471
How do they fix
anything with these?

25:06.939 --> 25:08.174
Look!

25:08.174 --> 25:10.209
It's the missing
rotator coupling.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.846
Oh, I'm still on hold.

25:15.414 --> 25:16.883
Come on, is lunch ready yet?

25:16.883 --> 25:18.150
It is actually.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.451
I got us barbecue.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.286
Yum.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.228
Guys, save
some of that for us.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.764
Oh, watch out, that's spicy.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.199
Hey, we're gonna
go eat outside.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.033
Bye!

25:34.033 --> 25:35.101
Outside?

25:35.101 --> 25:36.002
Country's great.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.236
Love you, Mom, bye.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.740
Would you look at that?

25:41.908 --> 25:43.843
What, you don't
think that's weird?

25:43.843 --> 25:46.412
I think it's two kids
enjoying the great outdoors.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.880
Mm-hmm.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.749
I think they're up to something.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.619
Oh, they're 100%
up to something,

25:52.619 --> 25:54.721
but at least they're
doing it outside.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.225
Whew!

26:00.192 --> 26:00.993
That's spicy.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.797
I told you.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.332
Yep.

26:08.067 --> 26:08.968
I'm still here.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.709
I think I got it.

26:16.709 --> 26:17.877
Wait!

26:20.246 --> 26:22.615
Hex, are you okay?

26:22.615 --> 26:25.084
Mission accomplished.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.252
Kids?

26:26.252 --> 26:28.020
Dad's coming, hide!

26:35.094 --> 26:35.928
Kids?

26:37.229 --> 26:38.698
Oh.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.532
Yeah, sorry, I thought I
heard a noise in my garage.

26:46.939 --> 26:47.774
Yeah, yeah.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.241
The box is over here.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.947
Yep, I see the switch.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.117
It's in the off position.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.054
Uh oh.

27:02.054 --> 27:02.889
Uh oh?

27:02.889 --> 27:04.423
What do you mean, uh oh?

27:04.423 --> 27:05.992
Oh no, the food's too spicy.

27:08.327 --> 27:12.264
Something is
wrong with my mouth.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.266
You're gonna give
away our position.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.304
Turning it on now.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.272
Hot, hot.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.074
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

27:24.343 --> 27:25.177
Yes, I'm fine.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.813
The power is on.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.181
Thank you.

27:35.755 --> 27:36.588
Somebody there?

27:38.424 --> 27:39.425
Hey, honey?

27:39.425 --> 27:40.592
In here!

27:40.592 --> 27:42.094
The power's back on.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.531
I know.

27:45.531 --> 27:46.565
I fixed it.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.139
Fire!

27:53.139 --> 27:54.440
My mouth is on fire!

27:57.777 --> 27:58.711
Here, drink this.

28:08.354 --> 28:09.155
Better?

28:10.289 --> 28:11.657
Yes.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.459
Excellent.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.361
Shall we eat?

28:15.361 --> 28:16.628
Yes.

28:16.628 --> 28:19.365
And do you have any more
of that spicy sauce?

28:45.992 --> 28:48.627
Is there something I
can help you with, fella?

28:48.627 --> 28:50.096
Hello.

28:50.096 --> 28:53.432
Hello,
sir, sorry to bother you.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.801
Marvin Skerety.

28:54.801 --> 28:58.737
I'm with the AIA and I
have a few readings here

28:58.737 --> 29:03.009
that suggest you may have
some extraterrestrials.

29:03.009 --> 29:03.910
Extra what?

29:05.611 --> 29:07.546
Terrestrials.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.448
No, sir.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.083
I don't know what
that fancy piece

29:11.083 --> 29:12.584
of equipment is telling you,

29:12.584 --> 29:16.255
but I can assure you we
don't have any terrestrials,

29:16.255 --> 29:17.723
let alone extras.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.691
I've got a couple chickens.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.260
You know, I've got a cat.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.596
No, no, no, I think
you're confused, sir.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.067
The AIA is the Alien
Intelligence Agency.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.936
You know, the little green men.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.170
Little green men?

29:33.539 --> 29:36.508
Don't you think there could
be little green women too?

29:40.179 --> 29:41.580
What?

29:41.580 --> 29:43.115
You never thought about that?

29:43.983 --> 29:46.085
I, I don't, I...

29:46.085 --> 29:46.919
Sorry, sorry.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.587
Look, can we rewind?

29:48.587 --> 29:50.957
I believe something
alien may have landed

29:50.957 --> 29:54.526
on your property last night
and I'm trying to recover it.

29:54.526 --> 29:55.361
Oh.

29:56.996 --> 29:57.830
Follow me.

30:04.670 --> 30:07.473
When I woke up this morning,
there was a hole in my roof

30:07.473 --> 30:10.076
and this thing was
laying in the dirt.

30:12.378 --> 30:13.779
I didn't touch it or nothing

30:13.779 --> 30:17.783
because I'm afraid of
radiation or something.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.387
Oh, it is definitely alien.

30:23.689 --> 30:24.523
Hmm.

30:25.691 --> 30:29.295
Well, Mr. Anderson,
thank you for your time.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.596
As a member of the AIA,

30:30.596 --> 30:33.599
it is my duty to take
this off of your hands.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.102
Whoa.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.536
You like the FBI?

30:37.536 --> 30:38.770
Sort of.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.272
We just aren't a bunch
of hacks held back

30:40.272 --> 30:43.209
by a bunch of red tape
and bureaucratic nonsense.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.512
They wouldn't hire you, right?

30:46.512 --> 30:47.779
No.

30:47.779 --> 30:51.083
But they will, once I
prove that aliens exist.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.987
Good luck with that.

30:54.987 --> 30:57.756
You have done a great
deal for your planet, sir.

30:57.756 --> 31:02.028
Unfortunately, you are going
to forget that I was ever here.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.099
What was that
light supposed to do?

31:08.267 --> 31:10.269
It was supposed
to make you forget.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.703
Did it work?

31:11.703 --> 31:12.538
No, sir.

31:13.872 --> 31:14.907
Darn it.

31:14.907 --> 31:16.575
The internet these days.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.378
What about 40 bucks?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.147
Would that make you forget?

31:22.314 --> 31:23.482
Forget what?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.658
It is only a matter of time

31:32.658 --> 31:35.427
before your owner
comes looking for you.

31:41.633 --> 31:44.670
I can't say I've ever
eaten anything quite like...

31:44.670 --> 31:46.038
What do you call that again?

31:47.039 --> 31:47.940
Barbecue.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.841
Barbecue, yes.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.843
It was rather delicious.

31:51.843 --> 31:54.280
The item should be right
around here, Captain.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.650
Is that it?

31:58.650 --> 32:00.219
Yeah, good eye.

32:00.219 --> 32:00.953
I'll get it.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.726
He must do that a lot.

32:07.726 --> 32:11.863
I've never seen him climb
a tree before in my life.

32:11.863 --> 32:14.500
You're doing great, Sam!

32:14.500 --> 32:15.334
Thanks.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.270
Whoa.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.307
Whose idea was this?

32:21.307 --> 32:23.009
You're almost there.

32:24.510 --> 32:25.477
Be careful!

32:26.578 --> 32:27.679
Yeah, I know.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.183
Got it.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.467
What just happened?

32:48.467 --> 32:50.302
We caught you
with our collars.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.605
They manipulate
electromagnetic waves.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.641
Oh, cool, cool.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.442
Yeah, cool.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.212
Oh, he did it again!

33:03.849 --> 33:04.783
Sam.

33:04.783 --> 33:05.917
Sam, are you all right?

33:06.918 --> 33:10.656
Come on.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.258
What happened?

33:12.258 --> 33:14.726
You fainted again.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.229
Oh, I thought I was done for.

33:18.897 --> 33:21.300
Wait, couldn't you just
have grabbed this thing

33:21.300 --> 33:22.868
using your collars?

33:22.868 --> 33:26.872
Yes, but you climbed the
tree before we could use them.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.840
You seemed happy to do it too.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.043
I thought it was fun to watch.

33:31.043 --> 33:33.679
Yeah, next time when you
have some amazing powers

33:33.679 --> 33:35.781
that can avoid my
impending doom,

33:35.781 --> 33:37.149
please feel free to stop me.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.218
This request
has been received.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.120
Perhaps we should
begin the repairs

33:41.120 --> 33:42.621
with the parts we have.

33:42.621 --> 33:43.722
A fine idea.

33:43.722 --> 33:44.790
Would you like to see our ship?

33:44.790 --> 33:45.624
Yeah.

33:55.734 --> 33:56.702
Here we are.

33:58.204 --> 34:01.173
I don't see anything.

34:01.173 --> 34:04.476
Computer, deactivate
cloaking device.

34:10.249 --> 34:11.817
Whoa.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.553
Welcome to the X76.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.524
This is crazy.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.593
Would you like to come inside?

34:21.593 --> 34:22.394
Yes.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.229
Sure.

34:33.105 --> 34:33.939
Wow.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.108
Wow.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.043
Hello, Computer.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.680
Welcome
back, Captain.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.349
I see you've brought guests.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.584
Yes, and some parts.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.886
I'm gonna start working
on some repairs.

34:47.886 --> 34:51.623
These are our new Earth
friends, Sam and Cassie.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.393
Greetings,
Sam and Cassie.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.894
Hello.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.363
Hi.

34:57.363 --> 34:59.165
This is the bridge.

34:59.165 --> 35:01.800
That's where Arcee
pilots the ship.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.770
And this is where I sit
to command the ship.

35:04.770 --> 35:05.937
Awesome.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.740
Well, is there anything
we can do to help?

35:08.740 --> 35:10.176
Yeah.

35:10.176 --> 35:11.076
Let me show you.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.228
All right, baby.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.296
Come to Papa.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.010
Is everything
ready, Hex?

35:45.010 --> 35:46.512
Yes, Captain.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.414
We have installed all the
parts that have been found.

35:50.048 --> 35:51.917
Okay, what's next?

35:51.917 --> 35:54.720
Commencing hover test now.

35:54.720 --> 35:55.987
Hover test?

35:55.987 --> 35:58.390
Initiating hover mode.

36:04.430 --> 36:05.864
It's so quiet.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.133
That's because it's riding
electromagnetic waves.

36:13.004 --> 36:17.008
Well, thanks to you, our
hover systems are back online.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.977
So you can go home now?

36:18.977 --> 36:20.246
No.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.448
It's enough for us
to move the ship,

36:22.448 --> 36:26.151
but not enough to leave
the planet's atmosphere.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.886
But it's a start.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.359
It's Mom and Dad.

36:33.359 --> 36:34.192
We have to go.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.928
- Bye, Computer.
- Bye, Computer.

36:36.928 --> 36:40.031
Nice meeting
you, Sam and Cassie.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.901
We really appreciate
your help today.

36:42.901 --> 36:45.103
If you want, we could
take you guys to town

36:45.103 --> 36:46.838
and find the rest of your parts.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.174
If it isn't any trouble.

36:49.174 --> 36:51.310
No, we wanna help you.

36:51.310 --> 36:52.344
Perfect.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.712
Let's make it so.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.214
Warning,
unidentified human approaching.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.216
Initiating security protocol.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.154
Oh, hello there.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.890
I thought I heard voices.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.360
Walking your dogs?

37:08.360 --> 37:10.762
Oh, yeah.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.767
Sorry to bother you,

37:15.767 --> 37:19.037
but you haven't by chance seen
any strange things out here,

37:19.037 --> 37:19.871
have you?

37:21.072 --> 37:24.242
Strange man with
a strange device?

37:24.242 --> 37:25.076
What?

37:26.211 --> 37:28.580
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm cool with that.

37:28.580 --> 37:32.050
I'm just looking for some
unusual metal pieces.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.285
Have you seen any?

37:33.285 --> 37:34.420
Nope.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.655
Nope, just some
garbage here and there.

37:36.655 --> 37:41.660
Hmm, anything like this?

37:42.828 --> 37:44.730
You mean like alien pieces?

37:44.730 --> 37:46.031
Cassie.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.766
What, what makes you
think this is alien?

37:47.766 --> 37:49.200
It's glowing, just like-

37:49.200 --> 37:50.035
Cassie.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.203
Just like what?

37:53.171 --> 37:54.773
Just like his video games.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.677
Yep, yeah, just like
my alien video games.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.319
Looks like I...

38:07.319 --> 38:08.987
Looks like I have something.

38:24.970 --> 38:25.804
What?

38:25.804 --> 38:26.672
What was that?

38:26.672 --> 38:28.106
Did you feel that?

38:28.106 --> 38:30.342
Yeah, crazy wind, right?

38:30.342 --> 38:33.011
What, what in the world?

38:33.011 --> 38:35.080
Well, we better get going.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.416
Good luck with your alien stuff.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.249
Hey!

38:39.651 --> 38:43.422
Just curious, I thought I heard
some other voices out here.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.023
Excuse me?

38:45.023 --> 38:47.693
You know, like adult voices?

38:47.693 --> 38:48.560
Oh.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.530
Uh...

38:51.530 --> 38:53.865
My brother was on the
phone with our parents.

38:53.865 --> 38:57.636
They want us to go home,
so we better listen.

38:57.636 --> 38:58.470
Yeah.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.007
Yeah, don't wanna
get in any trouble.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.176
Bye.

39:06.645 --> 39:11.249
Hey, if you happen to find
any, you know, alien pieces,

39:11.850 --> 39:12.651
give me a call.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.019
I'll even pay you.

39:15.554 --> 39:16.388
Yeah.

39:16.388 --> 39:17.923
Sounds good.

39:17.923 --> 39:18.824
Thank you.

39:19.691 --> 39:20.859
Come on, dogs.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.273
Sam, slow down!

39:35.273 --> 39:36.575
We can't!

39:36.575 --> 39:38.343
He might be following us.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.178
Did you see that, Captain?

39:40.178 --> 39:42.814
He had our gyroscope stabilizer.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.015
Indeed.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.984
But we have to get
them back to their ship.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.920
Captain, I don't
know who that guy is,

39:48.920 --> 39:51.322
but I think you should
spend the night with us.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.124
I agree with this plan.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.093
But what about
Mommy and Daddy?

39:55.093 --> 39:58.063
Yes, but what about
Mommy and Daddy?

39:58.063 --> 39:59.565
You let me worry about them.

40:00.632 --> 40:01.833
Whoa.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.202
We're staying in an
Earthling house tonight?

40:04.202 --> 40:07.473
Yes, so you'd better
behave yourself.

40:07.473 --> 40:11.176
Hey, I always behave myself.

40:11.176 --> 40:14.112
What about that
time on Meko 50?

40:14.112 --> 40:15.614
That wasn't my fault.

40:15.614 --> 40:19.451
And the time with
those throttle trops?

40:19.451 --> 40:21.119
They started it.

40:21.119 --> 40:23.789
Two words, urchin arena.

40:24.723 --> 40:25.824
Oh yeah.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.125
That was totally my fault.

40:39.571 --> 40:42.040
Sam,
Cassie, is that you?

40:42.040 --> 40:43.975
Yeah, Mom!

40:43.975 --> 40:45.477
Perfect timing.

40:45.477 --> 40:46.812
Come eat dinner.

40:46.812 --> 40:47.879
Mm, dinner.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.816
Hex, shh.

40:50.816 --> 40:51.617
What?

40:52.784 --> 40:55.654
You three just
wait here for a bit.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.122
I'll bring you dinner later.

40:57.122 --> 41:00.258
Approximately
how long is later?

41:00.258 --> 41:03.028
I don't know, whenever
we finish dinner?

41:03.028 --> 41:05.063
Kids, you heard your mom.

41:05.063 --> 41:05.897
Come on.

41:06.732 --> 41:07.866
Oh, there you kids are.

41:07.866 --> 41:08.700
Come on.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.402
Mm, looks really good.

41:11.402 --> 41:13.939
A lot easier now that
the power's back on.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.306
Where were you two today?

41:16.274 --> 41:17.809
Just out.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.711
We met some new friends.

41:19.711 --> 41:20.879
New friends?

41:20.879 --> 41:21.947
That's great.

41:21.947 --> 41:23.381
How old are they?

41:23.381 --> 41:27.118
Um, we don't know, but
they're really funny and nice.

41:36.061 --> 41:36.895
Aha.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.831
Hex, what are you doing?

41:41.232 --> 41:43.168
I am making us dinner.

41:45.804 --> 41:47.839
Sam told us to wait.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.175
He doesn't need to know.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.249
Hex, I order you to stop.

41:58.249 --> 41:59.084
Okay.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.319
But try this first.

42:06.925 --> 42:08.493
Oh.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.629
Hex, I order you
to keep cooking.

42:10.629 --> 42:12.631
Captain!

42:12.631 --> 42:14.766
I can't help
it, it's delicious.

42:33.785 --> 42:34.620
What was that?

42:35.687 --> 42:36.955
Just the wind?

42:36.955 --> 42:37.789
Mice?

42:39.725 --> 42:40.859
I'll go check it out.

42:40.859 --> 42:41.693
Me too.

42:44.930 --> 42:47.132
Now I really know
they're up to something.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.067
Definitely.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.306
What are you doing?

43:05.083 --> 43:08.319
What is going on in here?

43:09.955 --> 43:11.990
Let me guess.

43:11.990 --> 43:13.792
Your new friends?

43:15.694 --> 43:16.527
Yeah.

43:25.837 --> 43:29.407
Oh, the father figure
looks pretty upset.

43:29.407 --> 43:30.341
What's he saying?

43:31.376 --> 43:32.644
Hang on, hang on.

43:32.644 --> 43:34.846
I'm an expert at reading mouths.

43:36.314 --> 43:39.284
I really like dancing
around the lake

43:39.284 --> 43:41.419
with noodles on my head.

43:42.821 --> 43:45.090
That's not what he's saying.

43:45.090 --> 43:47.258
Yes, it is.

43:47.258 --> 43:48.760
Step aside, okay?

43:48.760 --> 43:51.462
Your mouth reading skills
are not as in tune as mine.

43:52.664 --> 43:56.768
Tomorrow, I want you
to go to Casablanca

43:56.768 --> 44:00.405
where you will find
the odors of the dudes.

44:01.439 --> 44:02.473
No way.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.542
Mine made more sense.

44:04.542 --> 44:05.811
Really?

44:05.811 --> 44:07.345
Dancing around the lake
with noodles on my head?

44:07.345 --> 44:08.546
That made more sense?

44:08.546 --> 44:10.481
Yeah, maybe that's his thing.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.083
I don't judge.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.385
Um, pardon me, Captain.

44:14.385 --> 44:17.188
But the biological makeup
of this dog form has

44:17.188 --> 44:21.359
very acute hearing, so I've
been using it to listen in.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.628
Mr. Griffin is very upset

44:23.628 --> 44:25.864
that the children tried
to hide us from them.

44:25.864 --> 44:29.134
But good news is he said
that we can stay here

44:29.134 --> 44:30.601
for the evening.

44:30.601 --> 44:32.303
Oh, well, that's great.

44:32.303 --> 44:35.406
And tomorrow, Sam and
Cassie have to go into town

44:35.406 --> 44:37.375
to find our owners.

44:37.375 --> 44:38.844
Wait, they're coming.

44:41.947 --> 44:44.015
All right, everybody in.

44:54.392 --> 44:56.294
All right, you three.

44:56.294 --> 44:58.496
We've decided that you can stay,

44:58.496 --> 45:01.933
but no more craziness like we
just saw in the kitchen, okay?

45:04.669 --> 45:05.603
Pretty smart dog.

45:07.072 --> 45:09.340
You two make sure you find
their owner tomorrow, okay?

45:09.340 --> 45:10.942
- Okay, Mom.
- Okay, Mom.

45:10.942 --> 45:12.944
All right, go
ahead, head up to bed.

45:12.944 --> 45:14.045
Good night.

45:15.146 --> 45:16.547
Come on, pups.

45:18.316 --> 45:19.785
Is that us?

45:19.785 --> 45:20.752
Yes, you.

45:20.752 --> 45:21.586
Come on.

45:24.589 --> 45:27.258
I made a nice little
place for you to sleep.

45:27.258 --> 45:29.227
Thank you, Cassie.

45:29.227 --> 45:31.529
Ooh, it's so soft.

45:31.529 --> 45:34.833
So tomorrow, Mom and Dad
are going to take us to town

45:34.833 --> 45:37.903
to find your owners.

45:37.903 --> 45:40.138
But this is perfect
'cause it gives us time

45:40.138 --> 45:42.473
to find the rest of
your ship pieces.

45:42.473 --> 45:43.308
Excellent.

45:43.308 --> 45:44.976
I like this plan.

45:44.976 --> 45:46.077
Shh, they're coming.

45:48.446 --> 45:49.547
All ready for bed?

45:50.481 --> 45:51.983
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

45:51.983 --> 45:54.052
John, don't you think maybe
you should take the dogs out

45:54.052 --> 45:55.954
for a little walk
before we go to bed?

45:56.922 --> 45:58.389
Yeah, okay.

45:59.557 --> 46:00.591
Pups, come on.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.627
Mush, mush, this...

46:02.627 --> 46:03.728
Come on, this way.

46:03.728 --> 46:04.562
Let's go.

46:05.864 --> 46:06.764
Goodnight, kids.

46:12.737 --> 46:13.805
All right, dogs.

46:13.805 --> 46:14.672
Do your business.

46:21.546 --> 46:22.480
Come on.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.882
It's getting, getting late.

46:23.882 --> 46:24.715
Do your thing.

46:29.420 --> 46:30.288
Come on.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.089
Go ahead.

46:32.390 --> 46:34.059
Come on, let's go.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.063
You better do this now.

46:38.063 --> 46:38.964
I'm not gonna get up in
the middle of the night

46:38.964 --> 46:40.065
to take you out again.

46:50.308 --> 46:52.577
I give up.

46:52.577 --> 46:54.980
You were gone for
like 30 minutes.

46:56.147 --> 46:58.749
They did not go
to the bathroom.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.252
They just stared at me.

47:02.453 --> 47:05.090
Maybe they didn't have
to go to the bathroom.

47:05.090 --> 47:07.158
It was the weirdest thing.

47:07.158 --> 47:09.861
It was like they
didn't know what to do.

47:12.964 --> 47:15.901
He wanted us to what?

47:15.901 --> 47:17.835
Go to the bathroom.

47:19.004 --> 47:21.572
Outside?

47:21.572 --> 47:24.242
Is that how humans do it?

47:24.242 --> 47:25.476
Ew.

47:25.476 --> 47:27.578
I'm gonna have to
watch where I step.

47:27.578 --> 47:31.749
No, we do it inside
in the toilets.

47:31.749 --> 47:34.785
But dogs do it outside.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.988
If you don't mind,

47:36.988 --> 47:38.456
I will not be going outside.

47:39.424 --> 47:40.458
Me neither.

47:40.458 --> 47:41.692
Uh-uh, nope.

47:42.994 --> 47:44.762
Hey, you guys need to
keep it down in here.

47:44.762 --> 47:46.431
I can hear you
through the walls.

47:46.431 --> 47:48.299
Sorry.

47:48.299 --> 47:49.400
We have a big day tomorrow.

47:49.400 --> 47:50.635
Get some rest.

47:50.635 --> 47:51.769
Sam's right.

47:51.769 --> 47:53.304
Everyone, let's get some sleep.

47:54.239 --> 47:55.140
Good night.

47:55.140 --> 47:56.474
- Good night.
- Night.

48:09.854 --> 48:11.222
Oh!

48:11.222 --> 48:12.823
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

48:30.275 --> 48:31.909
No more snacking before bed.

48:47.625 --> 48:49.227
Okay, you put up flyers

48:49.227 --> 48:50.395
so that Mom and Dad
think we're looking

48:50.395 --> 48:51.762
for the owners of the dogs.

48:53.164 --> 48:56.901
It looks like there are a
couple of ship pieces nearby,

48:56.901 --> 48:57.735
so let's go.

49:40.911 --> 49:42.180
What?

49:42.180 --> 49:44.982
The aldidinator should
have been right here.

49:44.982 --> 49:46.917
Maybe someone took it?

49:46.917 --> 49:50.555
Yeah, maybe that weird
guy from yesterday.

49:50.555 --> 49:52.923
We gotta find the
other parts fast.

49:52.923 --> 49:54.525
It looks like it's over there?

49:55.426 --> 49:56.261
Perfect.

50:03.968 --> 50:06.471
Should be around here somewhere.

50:09.574 --> 50:10.808
I don't see it.

50:14.245 --> 50:16.481
I think
it's up on the roof.

50:16.481 --> 50:17.315
I see it.

50:18.883 --> 50:19.784
I got it.

50:23.454 --> 50:26.224
Wow, it's really stuck.

50:26.224 --> 50:27.892
Here, let me help.

50:33.398 --> 50:34.599
Help.

50:34.599 --> 50:36.634
What's happening?

50:36.634 --> 50:38.203
Let me down, please.

50:38.203 --> 50:39.870
Let me down.

50:39.870 --> 50:40.871
Put him down!

50:40.871 --> 50:43.341
What's, what's happening?

50:43.341 --> 50:44.142
Okay.

50:48.846 --> 50:49.647
He dropped it.

50:55.853 --> 50:56.921
How did you do that?

50:57.788 --> 50:58.889
How did...

50:58.889 --> 51:00.057
Hey, hey, kids.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.726
Hey, where, where are you going?

51:01.726 --> 51:03.060
Kids, wait, wait.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.162
Hey, kids, come back!

51:04.162 --> 51:05.496
Hey, kids, kids.

51:06.397 --> 51:07.665
Come back here.

51:08.966 --> 51:10.968
Kids, where you going?

51:10.968 --> 51:11.802
Come back.

51:15.973 --> 51:16.807
In here.

51:20.178 --> 51:21.912
I just wanna talk to you!

51:33.023 --> 51:35.460
What is this magical place?

51:38.296 --> 51:39.597
It's an ice cream shop.

51:39.597 --> 51:40.898
Do you wanna try some?

51:40.898 --> 51:43.668
Does a mildridop
have eight arms?

51:45.136 --> 51:45.936
Uh, yes?

51:50.708 --> 51:54.579
That was the most pleasant
experience of my life.

51:54.579 --> 51:55.913
Agreed.

51:55.913 --> 51:58.516
What was your favorite flavor?

51:58.516 --> 52:00.050
Oh, the one at the bottom.

52:01.852 --> 52:04.322
You mean the cone?

52:04.322 --> 52:07.225
Yes, the cone was delightful.

52:20.638 --> 52:22.673
Wait, wait, where you going?

52:22.673 --> 52:24.008
Kids, wait, wait.

52:24.008 --> 52:25.075
Hey, kids, come back!

52:27.578 --> 52:28.946
He's chasing us!

52:41.025 --> 52:41.859
Marvin.

52:50.201 --> 52:51.101
Was that Marvin?

52:51.101 --> 52:52.136
Yeah, it was.

52:52.136 --> 52:53.438
You know that guy?

52:53.438 --> 52:54.972
Yeah, we went to
high school with him.

52:54.972 --> 52:55.773
Do you know him?

52:55.773 --> 52:57.475
- No.
- No.

52:57.475 --> 52:59.244
He had a huge
crush on your mom.

52:59.244 --> 53:00.778
No, he did not.

53:00.778 --> 53:01.712
Yes, he did.

53:01.712 --> 53:02.947
Why do you think you guys were

53:02.947 --> 53:04.482
in all the same
classes together?

53:04.482 --> 53:06.617
Because we both loved space.

53:27.004 --> 53:30.608
Mom, can we take the
dogs out for a walk?

53:30.608 --> 53:31.442
Sure.

53:31.442 --> 53:32.310
Be back before dark.

53:32.310 --> 53:33.611
Come on, doggies.

53:33.611 --> 53:34.712
Good luck with that.

53:35.913 --> 53:37.448
We're not gonna see
them for a while.

53:37.448 --> 53:39.717
Those dogs don't go to
the bathroom outside.

53:40.985 --> 53:42.320
They're trained
to use the toilet.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.121
You are talking nonsense.

53:44.121 --> 53:46.123
I saw it with my own eyes.

53:53.298 --> 53:54.131
Like that?

53:54.131 --> 53:55.466
That ought to do it.

53:55.466 --> 53:57.435
Okay, Arcee, try it now.

53:57.435 --> 54:00.538
Computer, initiate
flight systems.

54:00.538 --> 54:02.740
Initiating
flight systems.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.722
Systems initiation failure.

54:19.624 --> 54:21.326
It's no use.

54:21.326 --> 54:23.093
Without the pieces Marvin has,

54:23.093 --> 54:25.029
we aren't gonna be
able to make it home.

54:25.029 --> 54:28.466
Too bad we can't distract
him for a few hours.

54:28.466 --> 54:30.401
Wait, I got it.

54:30.401 --> 54:32.403
All we have to do is
convince Mom and Dad

54:32.403 --> 54:34.405
to invite Marvin
over for dinner.

54:34.405 --> 54:37.875
While he's over at our
house, you'll go to his house

54:37.875 --> 54:40.911
and collect all of
your spaceship pieces.

54:40.911 --> 54:42.913
Isn't that stealing, Sam?

54:42.913 --> 54:45.450
Not when he took something
that was already yours.

54:46.817 --> 54:48.218
I like this plan.

54:51.288 --> 54:54.892
So I downloaded the
blueprints from Marvin's lab.

54:54.892 --> 54:56.727
It seems that this is
the best way going in

54:56.727 --> 54:58.195
through the air duct here.

54:58.195 --> 55:02.433
So Arcee, if you could go
here and just go through here

55:02.433 --> 55:04.802
and get about here, you
could use your collars

55:04.802 --> 55:07.405
to float down and
get all your pieces.

55:07.405 --> 55:09.106
That doesn't sound too bad.

55:09.974 --> 55:11.709
It shouldn't be.

55:11.709 --> 55:13.177
We'll stall as much as we can,

55:13.177 --> 55:15.279
but don't spend too much
time looking around.

55:15.279 --> 55:16.481
Get in and get out.

55:16.481 --> 55:17.314
Got it?

55:17.314 --> 55:18.883
Got it.

55:18.883 --> 55:21.218
Now all we have to do
is convince Mom and Dad

55:21.218 --> 55:23.287
to invite Marvin
over for dinner.

55:24.121 --> 55:25.623
Okay, here's the plan.

55:27.191 --> 55:30.294
I will go search up some alien
websites on Dad's computer

55:30.294 --> 55:32.830
to get Marvin's
AIA ads popping up.

55:32.830 --> 55:36.000
Cassie, you will go ask
Mom about her space classes

55:36.000 --> 55:37.334
in high school with Marvin.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.470
Marvin, Marvin, Marvin.

55:39.470 --> 55:42.607
And Hex, you will drop
Marvin's business card

55:42.607 --> 55:43.708
where Dad can find it.

55:46.711 --> 55:47.778
Everybody good?

55:47.778 --> 55:49.013
Good.

55:51.315 --> 55:52.917
Hey guys, hope you don't mind,

55:52.917 --> 55:55.219
but your mom and I invited
our friend Marvin over

55:55.219 --> 55:56.854
for dinner tonight.

55:56.854 --> 55:58.456
Oh, you did?

55:58.456 --> 55:59.390
Yeah.

55:59.390 --> 56:00.625
So we're gonna need you guys

56:00.625 --> 56:01.392
to be on your best
behavior, okay?

56:01.392 --> 56:02.993
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:02.993 --> 56:06.196
Oh, and maybe leave
the dogs in the garage?

56:07.331 --> 56:08.165
Thanks.

56:14.238 --> 56:17.742
So do I still need
to bring the card in?

56:36.761 --> 56:39.530
Marvin,
so good to see you.

56:40.831 --> 56:42.399
- Oh yeah.
- Come on in.

56:42.399 --> 56:43.468
Absolutely.

56:44.301 --> 56:45.135
Yeah.

56:46.403 --> 56:47.505
All right, Marvin's here.

56:47.505 --> 56:49.139
Go, go, go.

56:49.139 --> 56:49.974
Come on.

56:51.341 --> 56:52.777
John.

56:52.777 --> 56:54.845
Marvin, how are you?

56:54.845 --> 56:56.847
- Good, good.
- Good to see you.

56:56.847 --> 56:57.682
Kids!

56:57.682 --> 56:58.516
Our guest is...

56:58.516 --> 57:00.250
We're right here, Mom.

57:00.250 --> 57:02.419
You snuck up on me.

57:02.419 --> 57:06.857
Marvin, these are our
children, Sam and Cassie.

57:06.857 --> 57:07.892
Hello.

57:07.892 --> 57:08.959
Nice to...

57:09.927 --> 57:11.228
Nice to meet you.

57:11.228 --> 57:13.498
Nice to meet you too.

57:14.832 --> 57:15.666
Shall we eat?

57:15.666 --> 57:16.501
Yes.

57:24.909 --> 57:26.310
Whoa.

57:26.310 --> 57:28.579
Somebody lives in this place?

57:29.714 --> 57:33.584
Captain, do we
have to go in there?

57:33.584 --> 57:34.719
Yes, we have to go in there.

57:34.719 --> 57:36.754
Come on, guys, we can do this.

57:36.754 --> 57:37.588
All right.

57:38.889 --> 57:40.558
Gotta fit.

57:48.566 --> 57:50.434
Oh, excuse me.

57:50.434 --> 57:51.969
That's my home alarm.

57:51.969 --> 57:52.903
Oh.

57:52.903 --> 57:53.938
Everything okay?

57:56.073 --> 57:57.274
Yes.

57:57.274 --> 58:01.145
Yes, it looks like a
few raccoons are trying

58:01.145 --> 58:03.814
to get into my trash, yes.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.449
Thankfully, I have
a few traps set up

58:05.449 --> 58:07.051
for situations like this.

58:13.558 --> 58:15.760
Look, there's the
opening up there.

58:16.927 --> 58:17.862
I'm on it.

58:28.338 --> 58:29.974
Okay, Hex, keep watch.

58:29.974 --> 58:32.276
Once we're in, we'll
open the door for you.

58:32.276 --> 58:33.578
You got it, Captain.

58:43.353 --> 58:44.689
Which way was it?

58:46.056 --> 58:47.625
Two lefts, then a right.

58:47.625 --> 58:48.659
That's right.

58:57.768 --> 58:59.536
Everything's going as planned.

59:00.738 --> 59:03.373
Hey, looks like you
left the door open.

59:03.373 --> 59:05.209
How about that?

59:08.746 --> 59:10.815
Are you sure
everything's okay?

59:10.815 --> 59:12.049
Hmm?

59:12.049 --> 59:14.051
Yep, yep, everything's
going according to plan.

59:15.519 --> 59:17.454
So Marvin, where
are you living now?

59:17.454 --> 59:18.956
Oh.

59:18.956 --> 59:22.226
Do you remember the
old science facility?

59:22.226 --> 59:24.261
Oh, those dome buildings?

59:24.261 --> 59:25.763
Yes, yes.

59:25.763 --> 59:26.964
I live out there.

59:26.964 --> 59:29.166
Wow, I loved those buildings.

59:29.166 --> 59:30.234
Yeah, you know,
after it closed down,

59:30.234 --> 59:31.602
I got it really cheap.

59:31.602 --> 59:33.437
You know, it's really secluded.

59:33.437 --> 59:34.271
Lots of space.

59:35.139 --> 59:36.073
That's so you.

59:37.808 --> 59:38.976
I'm gonna get the dessert.

59:38.976 --> 59:40.110
- Let me help.
- Okay.

59:46.884 --> 59:48.285
Hey, kids.

59:48.285 --> 59:49.687
Wanna see what I'm watching?

59:54.291 --> 59:55.993
Let's see here.

59:55.993 --> 59:58.062
Oh, there's our parts.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:04.769
Hey, Arcee!

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:05.836
Hey, Captain!

01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:08.806
Hex, how'd you get in here?

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:10.340
The door was open.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.010
And look, it's all of our stuff.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:20.985
No, Hex, wait!

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.254
Uh oh.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:34.999
Yes.

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:40.204
All that work
for nothing, huh?

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:41.005
Oh, yeah?

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.782
Uh oh.

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:52.917
What's that?

01:00:57.955 --> 01:00:58.756
Got it.

01:01:02.727 --> 01:01:04.194
Whoa!

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:05.629
Oh no, Arcee!

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:07.297
I, I can't hold on!

01:01:07.297 --> 01:01:10.500
Hold on, Arcee, maybe
I can push you up.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:12.937
I got her.

01:01:12.937 --> 01:01:14.839
Oh no, my collar isn't working.

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:18.575
What happened?

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:19.977
I figured out

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:23.213
your friends were manipulating
electromagnetic waves.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:26.016
My buildings were
made to block EMPs,

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.219
so now they're
pretty much helpless.

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:30.921
They're going to get hurt!

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:32.189
Maybe.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.658
But you all chose to
break into my house

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:37.294
instead of just asking me
for the metal pieces back.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.030
Why are you doing this?

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.833
Because all my life
people have laughed at me,

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:45.002
saying that aliens don't exist.

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:47.805
Well, I'm going to
prove them all wrong.

01:01:47.805 --> 01:01:49.673
And soon people will
finally believe me

01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:52.943
when I tell them that
there are aliens out there.

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:56.080
What makes you think
they'll believe you this time?

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.985
Because this time I'm calling
my contact from the FBI.

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:08.292
Oh, it's breaking.

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:10.060
Arcee, hold on!

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:13.530
No!

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:16.466
No!

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:17.301
What?

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.206
I didn't mean for
that to happen.

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:23.841
Who wants dessert?

01:02:25.009 --> 01:02:26.076
Cassie, wait!

01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:30.580
Actually I'm...

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.649
I'm pretty, pretty stuffed.

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:35.352
I better get going and take
care of those intruders.

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:36.753
Thanks for dinner.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.587
Sure.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.059
Dessert doesn't look
that bad, does it?

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.594
Well...

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:03.480
Skerety.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.215
Didn't I tell you if you
ever call my phone again,

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:06.851
I'd have you arrested?

01:03:06.851 --> 01:03:07.684
Yes, yes.

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:09.553
You did, Agent Bridger.

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:12.522
So I must have a good
reason to be calling you.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:15.325
You always claim to
have a good reason.

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:17.561
Ah, but this time is
a really good reason.

01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:19.263
I am sending you
videos right now.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:23.367
Lemme guess,
more alien conspiracy videos.

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:27.938
Oh, I knew you still
watched my videos.

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:29.874
What can I say, Skerety?

01:03:29.874 --> 01:03:31.675
My kids think you're hilarious.

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:33.643
This isn't a joke!

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:37.214
I just apprehended three
ETs disguised as dogs

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:38.916
and they have the ability

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:41.718
to manipulate
electromagnetic waves.

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:44.588
There are aliens among
us, Agent Bridger.

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:46.056
These videos are proof.

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:50.928
So you either do something
or I call the CIA.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.966
All right, now
calm down, Skerety.

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:57.834
I'll have my crew
take a look at it.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.536
We'll be in touch.

01:03:59.536 --> 01:04:00.370
Yes sir.

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:05.842
Yes, yes!

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:11.115
Oh, my time is finally here.

01:04:11.115 --> 01:04:14.718
FBI, here I come.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.564
Agent Dawes.

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:28.398
Yes sir.

01:04:30.434 --> 01:04:32.369
Get ready to move out.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:33.503
Everything good, sir?

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:35.739
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:04:36.941 --> 01:04:38.875
Looks like Skerety
finally paid off.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.810
Marvin the Martian, huh?

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:41.611
Who knew?

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:44.114
Oh, and Dawes.

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.751
Have a dissection
crew on hand too.

01:04:47.751 --> 01:04:50.487
It looks like he has some
live specimens for us.

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:51.655
Roger that.

01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:52.589
Let's move out!

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:01.198
Cassie, you all right?

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:04.201
No, we have to do something.

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:05.369
I know.

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:07.737
But what?

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.774
We could tell Mommy and Daddy.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:12.977
Tell 'em what?

01:05:12.977 --> 01:05:16.846
That our dogs were
secretly aliens

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:18.882
and their weird
friend kidnapped them,

01:05:18.882 --> 01:05:21.218
so now we have to go to
his house to save them?

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:22.953
Yeah.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.490
You know what?

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.058
I guess it doesn't
sound that weird

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:29.326
when you say it out loud.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:31.728
All right, let's go.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:44.074
Arcee, Captain?

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:48.378
Arcee!

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.315
Hex!

01:05:51.315 --> 01:05:52.949
Where's Ace?

01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:02.359
Did anyone get the name
of the ship that hit us?

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:04.628
Ace, you're okay!

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:05.962
So are you.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.464
Oh, wow.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.932
How are you, Hex?

01:06:08.932 --> 01:06:12.302
I'm fine, but I'm pretty
sure Marvin will be back soon,

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.572
so you two better
get out of here.

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:18.408
No, Hex, we aren't
leaving without you.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:19.609
It's okay, Captain.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:22.379
Please, you take the
pieces, get to the ship.

01:06:22.379 --> 01:06:23.213
I'll be fine.

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:25.449
Go!

01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:27.151
Don't worry about me.

01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:28.785
We'll be back.

01:06:28.785 --> 01:06:29.686
I know you will.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.732
Hi there.

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.168
And how is our little guest?

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:51.608
Yes, very cute,
but the jig is up.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.343
I already know
your little secret

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:56.246
and soon the whole
world will know it too.

01:06:57.681 --> 01:07:00.317
So there's no use in
continuing with the charade.

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:02.619
Uh, what's a charade?

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:05.855
I knew it, I knew
you could talk!

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.257
I knew it.

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:08.092
You got me.

01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:09.326
But what's a charade?

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:15.932
It means pretending
to be something you're not,

01:07:15.932 --> 01:07:18.468
like an alien
pretending to be a dog.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.706
Oh, you mean charade.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.274
Oh, I understand.

01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:28.044
I don't need English
lessons from you.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.879
Actually, I think it's French.

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:33.049
Okay, enough of that.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.919
Let's check in on your
friends, shall we?

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:41.658
Where are your friends?

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:43.293
I dunno.

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:46.062
It's fine, it's
fine, I only need you.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:49.299
And that, that fancy
collar of yours.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.170
That's what lets you manipulate
electromagnetic waves,

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:54.538
right?

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:55.905
Maybe.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.607
Let's document this, shall we?

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:02.679
All right, world, the moment
you've all been waiting for,

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:05.582
proof that I am not a quack!

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:15.091
No.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.527
Should I have told you
that was gonna happen?

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:19.629
Sorry, not sorry.

01:08:20.797 --> 01:08:23.066
So let me get this straight.

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:26.870
The three dogs that you
brought into our home are

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:29.739
really aliens from
another planet?

01:08:29.739 --> 01:08:31.675
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:08:31.675 --> 01:08:36.546
And now we have to go to
Marvin's science complex

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:37.747
to save them.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:39.149
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:43.787
Even if this story is true,

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:47.090
you came up with a plan

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.626
to break into another
person's house.

01:08:51.195 --> 01:08:54.598
Do you have any idea
how bad that is?

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:56.166
It's really bad.

01:08:57.401 --> 01:09:00.036
Really, really bad.

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:02.872
I know.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:06.243
And it's my fault, not
Cassie's, but we need to go.

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:07.944
You two aren't going anywhere.

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:11.147
I'll go over to Marvin's house

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:16.119
and ask if he has my kids'...

01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:25.262
Alien dogs?

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.675
Hey, look, he fainted.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:40.977
Like father, like son.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:42.212
You're okay!

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:43.547
Yes, we're fine.

01:09:43.547 --> 01:09:45.849
But Marvin still has Hex.

01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:47.351
We need to get him.

01:09:47.351 --> 01:09:50.254
I'm pretty sure Marvin
already called the FBI.

01:09:50.254 --> 01:09:51.621
The FBI?

01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:54.824
The FBI hurts aliens.

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:56.125
We better hurry.

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.061
Shall we, Mrs. Griffin?

01:09:58.061 --> 01:09:59.996
Uh, sure?

01:09:59.996 --> 01:10:01.231
Okay, let's go.

01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:08.204
Come on, honey.

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:11.975
What's going on?

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:13.510
We're helping alien dogs.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:14.711
- We are?
- Uh huh.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.780
Yes, and we really
appreciate this.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.249
Captain Ace, at your service.

01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:20.317
Arcee.

01:10:20.317 --> 01:10:22.719
Nice to officially meet you.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.988
Nice to meet you.

01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:26.456
Is this a dream?

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:30.627
Uh, not unless we're
having the same dream.

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:32.629
No more letting the
kids play outside.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:47.076
Wanna try for three?

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:47.877
Ow.

01:10:48.878 --> 01:10:49.679
What the...

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.782
Where are the ship pieces?

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.584
Did your, did your
friends take them?

01:11:02.326 --> 01:11:04.060
We're not finished here, mister.

01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:08.932
Agent Bridger, hello.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:10.534
My crew's validated your intel

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:12.869
and we are headed
to your location.

01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:14.304
Really?

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.540
I mean, perfect, perfect,
I'll see you there.

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.941
I mean, here.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.410
And Skerety,
don't mess this up.

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:22.812
No, sir.

01:11:22.812 --> 01:11:23.880
No, sir, absolutely not.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.482
I've got it all...

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:26.316
Hello?

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:29.085
He hung up.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.857
Okay, Arcee, Sam,
and Mrs. Griffin,

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:36.159
you head to the ship and
finish with the repairs.

01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:38.995
Mr. Griffin, Cassie, and I
will go to Marvin's complex

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:40.029
to save Hex.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:40.864
Got it?

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:41.698
Got it.

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:45.134
Whoa, isn't this a bit much?

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.670
John, it's gonna be fine.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:49.473
You save their friend, I'll
meet you back here later.

01:11:49.473 --> 01:11:51.040
Are you sure?

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.042
I have been staring at
the stars my whole life,

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:55.078
waiting for a moment like this.

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:56.045
It's gonna be fine.

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:01.451
All right, good enough for me.

01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:02.285
Let's go.

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.393
All right, time for us to go.

01:12:09.393 --> 01:12:10.394
Oh.

01:12:10.394 --> 01:12:11.495
You mean I don't
get to stay here

01:12:11.495 --> 01:12:13.997
in these fancy accommodations?

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:16.933
No, I have something
even fancier.

01:12:18.802 --> 01:12:21.004
And before you get any ideas,

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:24.508
I've added a few upgrades
to this here carrier

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:26.843
so you can't use your
little superpower.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.712
So don't even think about it.

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:31.114
Come on, little doggy.

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:37.721
How you doing with
that stabilizer, Sam?

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:39.188
Almost got it.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.425
Oh, is there anything
I can do to help?

01:12:41.425 --> 01:12:44.127
You're doing
great, Mrs. Griffin.

01:12:44.127 --> 01:12:45.294
Got it.

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:51.901
Hello, Computer.

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:52.802
Hello.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:55.338
Hey, Computer.

01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:57.006
Welcome back, Sam.

01:12:57.006 --> 01:12:59.242
This is Mrs. Griffin.

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:01.010
Greetings,
Mrs. Griffin.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.345
Hi.

01:13:02.345 --> 01:13:04.347
You can call me Avery.

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:05.749
Greetings, Avery.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:07.150
I am Computer.

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:09.719
This is amazing.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.889
It is not too far from
what I always imagined.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:15.391
Computer, status report.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.226
Systems check.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.763
Stabilizers are online.

01:13:19.763 --> 01:13:22.265
Ship is ready for operation.

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:23.099
Ha!

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:24.333
We did it.

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:25.802
Although.

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:27.804
What do you mean, although?

01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:29.305
A short
has caused some loss

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:30.807
to the star charts,

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:33.309
and we still don't have full
access to the power core,

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:34.544
making it impossible

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:37.046
to leave this planet's
gravitational pull.

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:38.582
Oh no.

01:13:38.582 --> 01:13:40.416
We're gonna need Hex
for the power core,

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.751
and I don't know
what we're gonna do

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.720
about these star charts.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.321
Star charts?

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:47.123
I am the queen of star charts.

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:48.725
Computer, what are you missing?

01:13:49.593 --> 01:13:50.860
Calculating.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:02.405
They're beautiful.

01:14:02.405 --> 01:14:03.840
As you can see,

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.342
I am missing several sections
of this galaxy's charts.

01:14:06.342 --> 01:14:07.176
That's all?

01:14:08.077 --> 01:14:09.378
This is what I do.

01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:13.650
Sam, my boy, watch
your mama work.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:25.929
Yeah, way to go, Mom.

01:14:29.232 --> 01:14:33.269
Any moment now, my
life is going to change.

01:14:33.269 --> 01:14:34.337
Yep.

01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:36.039
And mine is too.

01:14:36.039 --> 01:14:37.541
I sure hope it was worth it.

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:40.910
You know how many doctors
my parents brought me to

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:44.313
because they didn't
believe I saw aliens?

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.214
I don't know, two?

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:47.316
A lot.

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:50.019
It was a lot.

01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:53.757
But I thought none
of this matters

01:14:53.757 --> 01:14:57.727
because the aliens
promised they'd come back

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:02.732
and when they did, it
would make it all better.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.171
But they didn't.

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:10.874
They didn't come back.

01:15:12.676 --> 01:15:13.509
So...

01:15:14.978 --> 01:15:16.880
So, I'm sorry you
have to be the one

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.114
to make it all worth it.

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:20.416
But that's just the
way it has to be.

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:25.454
You know, there's a
lot of us out there.

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:27.256
Some aren't as
advanced as others

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:30.293
and space travel
takes a long time.

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.463
It's possible they just
haven't made it back here yet.

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:36.399
Or maybe they just got lost.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:40.136
The universe is a big place.

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:51.180
Yeah, well, it's too late now.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:15:59.455
All right.

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:02.058
Let's go save your friend.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:02.926
Roger that.

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:11.701
Hey, Marvin.

01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:14.203
What, what
are you doing here?

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:15.038
Relax.

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:16.105
We're just here to talk.

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:17.941
Don't come any closer!

01:16:17.941 --> 01:16:20.977
Do you think we're just gonna
let you give Hex to the FBI?

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:22.879
Who's going to stop me?

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:24.614
I am.

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:36.125
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:36.960
Oh yeah?

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.194
Why?

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:39.829
You didn't think
I planned ahead?

01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:42.398
One push and your
friend gets zapped.

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:44.734
Don't hurt him!

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:48.772
Then tell your little
alien friend to put me down.

01:16:48.772 --> 01:16:50.073
Put him down, Captain.

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:58.447
Now, everybody,
everybody back up, please.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.416
Yeah, that's right,
that's more like it.

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:01.985
Get outta here,
there's nothing to see!

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:03.519
Leave, go home.

01:17:03.519 --> 01:17:06.956
Yeah, I'll give you 10 seconds
or I'll push the button.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:07.791
Get out.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.229
Mr. Martin?

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:15.564
I'm really sorry we
broke into your home.

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:18.567
And you were right, we should
have just asked for your help.

01:17:20.303 --> 01:17:22.939
Please don't be mad
at our alien friends?

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:24.140
They just wanna go home.

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:34.050
It's okay.

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:35.551
Let's go, come on.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:41.791
Cassie, I'm sorry.

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:43.727
She gave you Rumpelstiltskin.

01:17:44.828 --> 01:17:46.963
That's so nice.

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:49.799
And that button you
were going to push.

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:51.735
Wasn't that just
your car remote?

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:57.874
Quiet, you.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:14.523
There he is.

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:17.160
Showtime.

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:38.081
Well.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:42.118
Nice to see you, Skerety.

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:42.952
You too.

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:46.622
You
have what we came for?

01:18:46.622 --> 01:18:47.490
Yes sir.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.762
Go for dissection team.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:01.971
What?

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:04.340
You, you brought
a dissection team?

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.542
Just a precautionary measure.

01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:07.443
See what you have.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.085
What is this, Skerety?

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.088
What?

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.556
What happened?

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:24.160
It must have transformed
into a stuffed animal.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.029
What is this,
some kind of joke?

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.840
Sir, we have a vehicle
leaving the perimeter.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.673
That's them!

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:42.078
Hold on to your cowboy hats.

01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:43.279
Yeehaw.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.849
I'm not
wearing a cowboy hat!

01:19:45.849 --> 01:19:46.782
Move out!

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.818
Cancel dissection team.

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:50.319
You're done, Skerety.

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:52.188
Oh, I was hoping that
wouldn't be your response,

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:53.890
but I understand.

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:04.367
All right, Sam, do
you see some tubes?

01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:06.135
Yes, tubes, got it.

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:08.905
Connect those into the goo.

01:20:08.905 --> 01:20:09.839
How far?

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:10.874
Until it lights up.

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:13.742
Got it.

01:20:16.279 --> 01:20:17.413
Okay, now what?

01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:20.016
Now do that five more times.

01:20:20.016 --> 01:20:21.050
Come on.

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:27.023
What you get on those plates?

01:20:27.023 --> 01:20:29.392
I found an address, but
it's in New York City.

01:20:29.392 --> 01:20:31.394
All right, see what
else you can find.

01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:34.130
Come on, can't
you go any faster?

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:35.298
Yes sir.

01:20:35.298 --> 01:20:36.665
But is the point to catch them

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.035
or follow them to
the destination?

01:20:39.035 --> 01:20:41.504
Odds are they're headed
to the alien ship.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:42.805
Well, if you catch them,

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:45.608
I can force 'em to tell
me where their ship is.

01:20:45.608 --> 01:20:46.409
Yes sir.

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:53.782
Oh, they're gaining on us.

01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:01.424
Captain, I've got an idea.

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:03.159
Would you mind if
I tried something?

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:03.993
Go for it.

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:24.380
Whoa.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.615
Okay, everyone, hold on.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:53.776
Agent Bridger,

01:21:53.776 --> 01:21:55.311
I found a local address
for those plates.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.115
Let me hear it.

01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:06.189
That was awesome.

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:09.258
Those guys gonna be okay?

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:10.126
Oh yeah.

01:22:10.126 --> 01:22:11.560
It's only temporary.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.462
They'll grow back
in a few minutes.

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:18.667
Good, because I can't
have the FBI after me.

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:19.802
Hurry, to the ship.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:22.105
To the ship.

01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:24.240
Okay, last one.

01:22:30.846 --> 01:22:32.081
Okay, it worked.

01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:35.151
Sam, you did it!

01:22:36.519 --> 01:22:38.454
Main
power core activated.

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:42.558
Thank you for fixing
the maps, Mrs. Griffin.

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:43.592
Glad to help.

01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:44.827
Yeah.

01:22:44.827 --> 01:22:47.796
Computer, set a course home.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.598
Setting course.

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:50.666
Course complete.

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:53.369
Captain Ace approaching.

01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:56.639
They're back.

01:22:58.341 --> 01:22:59.742
Oh, honey.

01:22:59.742 --> 01:23:00.643
Hey, guys.

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:01.977
Hex!

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:04.413
All right, we
better make this fast.

01:23:04.413 --> 01:23:06.015
Is everything good to go?

01:23:06.015 --> 01:23:07.216
Yes, Captain.

01:23:08.384 --> 01:23:10.186
Thank you all so
much for your help.

01:23:11.287 --> 01:23:13.622
Yes, thank you.

01:23:13.622 --> 01:23:17.993
We really couldn't have done
any of this without all of you.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:18.794
Sam.

01:23:20.896 --> 01:23:21.830
Captain.

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.066
You're quite the leader.

01:23:23.066 --> 01:23:26.202
Your plan saved the
day several times.

01:23:26.202 --> 01:23:29.772
Who knows, maybe one day you'll
become a captain yourself.

01:23:29.772 --> 01:23:30.673
Are you hearing this?

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:31.740
Hear this?

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:32.608
I saw it.

01:23:34.577 --> 01:23:35.878
Thank you, Captain Ace.

01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:37.113
I learned a lot from you.

01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:42.051
Bye, Arcee.

01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:43.086
Bye, Cassie.

01:23:43.086 --> 01:23:44.187
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:46.155
Bye, Sam.

01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:52.928
Oh, I'm sure gonna
miss all that food.

01:23:52.928 --> 01:23:53.762
Bye, buddy.

01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:56.632
Take care, everyone.

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:00.035
Bye, Cassie.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:00.803
Be good.

01:24:01.837 --> 01:24:02.671
I will.

01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:08.911
Bye, Mrs. Griffin.

01:24:09.845 --> 01:24:10.979
Bye, Sam.

01:24:13.849 --> 01:24:16.252
Hex, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

01:24:25.928 --> 01:24:26.762
Wait!

01:24:28.131 --> 01:24:29.365
Marvin?

01:24:29.365 --> 01:24:31.400
Is it okay if I
say goodbye too?

01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:34.170
Of course.

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.642
I'm sorry I was
going to turn you in.

01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:40.909
I...

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.378
I know you are.

01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:44.647
And I knew you weren't
gonna go through with it.

01:24:44.647 --> 01:24:45.481
You did?

01:24:46.649 --> 01:24:47.483
Yep.

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:50.919
So, this is your ship?

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.321
Yep.

01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:54.423
Was it here the whole time?

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:55.858
Uh, yep.

01:24:57.493 --> 01:24:59.662
I knew
I wasn't crazy.

01:24:59.662 --> 01:25:01.164
And you never were.

01:25:01.997 --> 01:25:03.432
Always remember that.

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:07.536
I will.

01:25:07.536 --> 01:25:09.238
Is now a good time
to remind everybody

01:25:09.238 --> 01:25:11.374
that the feds are gonna
be here any minute?

01:25:23.319 --> 01:25:26.422
Ah, yeah, that's more like it.

01:25:26.422 --> 01:25:27.856
Bye!

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:28.691
Bye.

01:25:31.994 --> 01:25:33.296
Thank you!

01:25:33.296 --> 01:25:34.963
Bye!

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:35.798
Bye.

01:26:03.559 --> 01:26:05.628
Stop them, stop them!

01:26:05.628 --> 01:26:07.029
I'm not sure how, sir!

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.201
You all are in
so much trouble.

01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:14.637
Oh, no, we aren't.

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.674
What are you
gonna do with that?

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:22.311
My alien friends left me
this shrinking technology.

01:26:22.311 --> 01:26:25.147
So if you mess with me
or this family again,

01:26:26.081 --> 01:26:27.950
I will shrink you.

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.885
This time, permanently.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:32.555
You wouldn't.

01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:35.123
Try me.

01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:43.999
You haven't seen the
last of me, Skerety.

01:26:45.268 --> 01:26:46.101
Let's go.

01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:52.875
I look forward to our next
encounter, Agent Bridger.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.715
Marvin, you really came
through for us today.

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:01.250
Yes, you did.

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:02.084
Thank you.

01:27:04.186 --> 01:27:06.289
It's nice to have
people believe in you.

01:27:12.528 --> 01:27:14.463
And kids, my wish came true.

01:27:14.463 --> 01:27:15.431
What's that?

01:27:15.431 --> 01:27:17.500
My wish on the shooting star.

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.001
Yeah?

01:27:19.001 --> 01:27:20.469
I wished that you guys
would have a good summer.

01:27:21.504 --> 01:27:23.171
I think that came true.

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:24.573
- We did.
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:41.890 --> 01:27:44.860
Ah, quite an adventure.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.495
Yes, it was.

01:27:46.495 --> 01:27:48.497
Do you think we'll
ever see them again?

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.634
You never know.

01:27:51.634 --> 01:27:53.369
I hope so.

01:27:53.369 --> 01:27:56.672
Me too, Arcee, me too.

01:27:56.672 --> 01:27:59.642
Computer, take us home.

01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:01.777
Affirmative, Captain.

01:29:09.211 --> 01:29:12.715
Little
Marvin, is that you?

01:29:12.715 --> 01:29:15.951
You came back,
after all these years.

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:19.187
You finally came back.
