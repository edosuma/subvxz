00:07.341 --> 00:09.237
â™ª MTV...

00:28.548 --> 00:30.617
What the fuck?

00:51.996 --> 00:54.272
There she is.

00:54.272 --> 00:55.617
How you feeling?

00:55.617 --> 00:57.031
Like I was drugged.

00:57.031 --> 00:59.651
Yeah.
There's a reason for that.

01:01.168 --> 01:02.893
Come over here.

01:02.893 --> 01:04.858
What is that?

01:04.858 --> 01:06.996
It's a little pick-me-up.
Turn around.

01:07.996 --> 01:09.617
Give me a cheek.

01:16.651 --> 01:17.893
How long does it take to--

01:17.893 --> 01:19.789
What the fuck?

01:19.789 --> 01:21.617
- Bout that long...
- Jesus.

01:21.617 --> 01:24.065
You got another one to keep my
heart from exploding? Fuck!

01:24.065 --> 01:26.272
You're welcome.

01:26.272 --> 01:28.031
We're loading up.
How ya feelin' tiger?

01:28.031 --> 01:29.927
- I'm awake.
- Good. Let's boogie.

01:29.927 --> 01:31.824
I'm gonna break
down her room.

01:35.789 --> 01:37.203
I don't remember anything.

01:38.927 --> 01:41.789
He drugged you.
GHB we think.

01:41.789 --> 01:43.031
We talked
about this last night.

01:43.031 --> 01:44.306
I don't remember.

01:46.824 --> 01:49.031
Do I need to get tested
for STDs or something?

01:49.031 --> 01:52.134
No need.
He didn't get that far.

01:53.755 --> 01:54.962
How far did he get?

01:54.962 --> 01:57.582
He didn't get nowhere.

01:57.582 --> 01:58.893
We got there in time.

01:59.893 --> 02:01.824
My underwear is gone.

02:03.962 --> 02:06.065
We got there
in the nick of time.

02:08.168 --> 02:12.100
Marine, I wouldn't
bullshit you on this.

02:14.893 --> 02:17.100
Okay. Yeah.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.306
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.789
Yeah. Don't got
to ask me twice. Fuck.

03:36.134 --> 03:39.824
Neal. What do we know?

03:39.824 --> 03:41.858
She's still in surgery.

03:44.375 --> 03:45.341
Kaitlyn.

03:45.341 --> 03:46.962
Hey, Neal.

03:49.513 --> 03:52.134
You went gray.
When did that happen?

03:52.134 --> 03:54.065
Last night.

03:54.065 --> 03:55.031
Neal

03:55.031 --> 03:57.065
- Alan.
- Hey.

03:57.065 --> 03:59.134
Hi, Jill.

03:59.134 --> 04:00.237
So, she's in recovery.

04:00.237 --> 04:01.824
The procedure went well.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.548
There is considerable
soft tissue damage,

04:03.548 --> 04:06.927
but doesn't appear to be
significant nerve damage.

04:06.927 --> 04:10.100
The procedure is called an open
reduction internal fixation

04:10.100 --> 04:12.410
where we make an incision that
allows us to insert a rod

04:12.410 --> 04:14.203
through the center of the femur,

04:14.203 --> 04:16.410
and we attach a plate outside
to stabilize the fracture.

04:16.410 --> 04:19.203
How long will it
take to recover?

04:19.203 --> 04:20.444
We have to look at healing

04:20.444 --> 04:22.203
from three different perspectives.

04:22.203 --> 04:24.100
The bone itself, the soft
tissue around the bone

04:24.100 --> 04:25.444
and procedure site,
and the incision itself,

04:25.444 --> 04:27.168
which is fairly substantial...

04:27.168 --> 04:32.100
Just tell me what a year
from now is like for her.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.237
Honestly, I don't know.

04:34.927 --> 04:36.410
She's young,
so that's an advantage,

04:36.410 --> 04:38.513
but her bones are still growing.

04:38.513 --> 04:41.513
So, how if at all does this
injury affect that growth?

04:41.513 --> 04:44.065
Time answers that question.

04:44.065 --> 04:45.858
Neal, can I talk to
you for a second?

04:50.513 --> 04:53.134
She's up to speed
on everything.

04:53.134 --> 04:55.100
Okay...

04:55.100 --> 04:56.824
So she was spotting
on the table,

04:56.824 --> 04:58.893
so it looks like her body
rejected the pregnancy.

05:02.513 --> 05:05.134
That's a decision
we don't have to make.

05:05.134 --> 05:07.065
When she wakes, I'll
get you back to recovery.

05:07.065 --> 05:08.444
I want to be there
when she wakes.

05:08.444 --> 05:09.858
Okay, I'll bring you back.

05:11.168 --> 05:12.824
Joe.

05:15.548 --> 05:17.962
Can I have two hours?

05:17.962 --> 05:21.065
Yeah, but
you can't have three.

05:34.031 --> 05:35.237
Coffee?

05:45.617 --> 05:47.375
How's Errol?

05:47.375 --> 05:49.444
He's happiest in a downturn.

05:49.444 --> 05:51.548
Worse the economy,
the jollier the man.

05:51.548 --> 05:53.134
That's interesting.

05:53.134 --> 05:54.410
What's the philosophy
behind that?

05:54.410 --> 05:56.272
Be greedy when
everybody's scared

05:56.272 --> 05:58.100
and scared when
everybody's greedy.

05:59.513 --> 06:01.582
Pretty good philosophy.

06:01.582 --> 06:03.548
You can ask the question
you really want to ask.

06:03.548 --> 06:07.168
Why bother, Kaitlyn?
You can't answer it.

06:07.168 --> 06:09.168
If you need her in
three hours today,

06:09.168 --> 06:10.375
then you must really need her.

06:10.375 --> 06:13.444
I do.
Which is to say the nation does.

06:13.444 --> 06:15.237
Which is why
I'm not asking the question.

06:16.996 --> 06:18.548
Don't give up on her, Neal.

06:19.686 --> 06:21.548
I wish I could.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.306
But when she walks in a room
it still takes my breath away.

06:26.582 --> 06:28.410
Pretty good reason
for sticking around.

06:30.203 --> 06:31.617
Yep.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.065
Hey.

07:01.513 --> 07:03.306
Hey...

07:08.755 --> 07:10.341
My friends are dead.

07:11.755 --> 07:13.341
I know, honey.

07:17.168 --> 07:20.444
I know how that feels.

07:20.444 --> 07:23.617
And I hate that you
know it now, too. I'm so sorry.

07:31.375 --> 07:34.065
I'm a bad mother.
I know that's what you think.

07:36.134 --> 07:38.479
I'd think it too, if I was
in your shoes, I guess.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.100
What you don't understand

07:43.100 --> 07:45.237
is all the little moments
of your life

07:45.237 --> 07:47.237
that I've missed...

07:47.237 --> 07:50.686
I missed those moments so other
families can have them.

07:52.513 --> 07:56.686
It's you who makes the
sacrifice for the job I chose.

07:58.686 --> 08:02.651
I always thought I was
setting an example for you,

08:02.651 --> 08:06.134
that a woman can
do virtually anything...

08:06.134 --> 08:08.513
anything she sets her mind to.

08:09.824 --> 08:12.720
And when I do my job well,
lives are saved.

08:12.720 --> 08:17.306
Just like your father,
he saves lives every day.

08:17.306 --> 08:21.410
But he gets to come home
to you every night,

08:21.410 --> 08:23.755
I envy him that.

08:28.479 --> 08:30.168
Your mom's a soldier.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.513
You can look at my life
and you can choose

08:34.513 --> 08:36.306
to live yours different.
I will respect that.

08:36.306 --> 08:39.513
Fuck, I'll cheer that decision.

08:42.513 --> 08:45.306
You can hate what I do, honey.

08:45.306 --> 08:48.306
You can hate me.

08:48.306 --> 08:52.444
But punishing yourself is
a terrible way to show it.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.375
I don't hate you.

08:56.858 --> 09:00.065
I don't hate you.
I just miss you.

09:06.341 --> 09:08.444
I miss you, too.

09:10.686 --> 09:12.858
Every day.

09:14.444 --> 09:17.410
You're gonna be an
adult soon enough,

09:17.410 --> 09:19.237
and what you're dealing
with right now,

09:19.237 --> 09:21.375
these are adult problems.

09:21.375 --> 09:26.444
Your whole life is going to
be nothing but adult problems

09:26.444 --> 09:27.858
soon enough.

09:29.686 --> 09:31.237
My advice to you?

09:32.927 --> 09:36.444
Be a girl for as long
as you can.

09:36.444 --> 09:38.720
Don't rush to be a woman.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.824
Cause once you are, you don't
ever get to be a girl again.

09:40.824 --> 09:43.134
Did dad tell you everything?

09:43.134 --> 09:44.755
Depends what you
mean by everything.

09:46.341 --> 09:52.410
Did he tell you
about my... situation?

09:54.651 --> 09:57.134
You mean your situation
of you getting pregnant?

10:02.168 --> 10:03.134
What do I do?

10:05.479 --> 10:06.789
God decided that.

10:08.479 --> 10:09.789
What does that mean?

10:09.789 --> 10:11.755
It means you're
not pregnant anymore.

10:16.513 --> 10:18.341
How does that make you feel?

10:21.582 --> 10:23.479
I'm not ready to be a mother.

10:28.410 --> 10:29.720
You know the one
way to guarantee

10:29.720 --> 10:30.824
you don't become one, right?

10:34.582 --> 10:38.789
Look, the days of me
and your father grounding you

10:38.789 --> 10:42.548
or inventing some punishment
to keep you

10:42.548 --> 10:45.893
from being exactly
where you are right now?

10:45.893 --> 10:48.617
Those days are gone.

10:48.617 --> 10:51.479
We lost.

10:51.479 --> 10:54.134
And life snuck up
and took a bite out of you.

10:55.341 --> 10:56.858
And now I'm just here to...

10:59.824 --> 11:02.479
just to give you advice.

11:03.893 --> 11:05.927
Okay?

11:05.927 --> 11:08.789
I've made all the mistakes
you've made

11:08.789 --> 11:11.168
and a lot more you haven't
thought about yet.

11:11.168 --> 11:13.962
You got pregnant by accident?

11:13.962 --> 11:16.306
Yeah.

11:16.306 --> 11:17.962
What did you do?

11:17.962 --> 11:19.686
My situation was
a little different.

11:19.686 --> 11:22.203
I was already married.

11:22.203 --> 11:25.720
Your father was in medical
school, I was in a team.

11:25.720 --> 11:29.375
Timing...
Timing was terrible.

11:29.375 --> 11:30.927
Did you get an abortion?

11:32.824 --> 11:35.686
If I had, I wouldn't be
talking to you right now.

11:38.858 --> 11:42.686
And so, every time
I look at you

11:42.686 --> 11:45.617
I think about that
coat closet

11:45.617 --> 11:48.306
at the Double Tree Hotel
that New Year's Eve.

11:48.306 --> 11:53.720
Ugh. Parents having
sex for fun? That is so gross.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.720
Yeah.
Right back at ya, kiddo.

12:04.996 --> 12:07.203
Do you know what's going
to happen to my leg?

12:08.789 --> 12:11.479
I'm gonna leave the
doctor stuff to your father.

12:12.548 --> 12:13.996
How you feeling?

12:13.996 --> 12:16.272
Not feeling much.

12:16.272 --> 12:17.927
They have a room
ready for her.

12:17.927 --> 12:19.686
We're going to take her up.

12:19.686 --> 12:21.720
And I'll have an orderly meet
you in the lobby.

12:24.651 --> 12:26.513
I've gotta go do
something for work

12:26.513 --> 12:28.617
and I'll be back in
a few days, okay?

12:28.617 --> 12:30.444
You won't be missing much.

12:30.444 --> 12:31.893
Yes, I will.

12:48.755 --> 12:51.479
- Ma!
- Hi.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.375
Hi.

12:57.893 --> 12:59.789
They're taking her up
to a room.

12:59.789 --> 13:01.858
Yep.

13:01.858 --> 13:06.617
I gotta go.
I gotta take care of something.

13:06.617 --> 13:07.927
Yeah. I'm aware.

13:07.927 --> 13:11.065
Few days type thing, or...

13:11.065 --> 13:12.893
If I'm lucky.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.617
When's the last time
you were lucky?

13:14.617 --> 13:17.962
Luck is perspective.

13:17.962 --> 13:19.341
Only in your business.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.893
You been good in school?

13:20.893 --> 13:22.927
We're learning
the alphabet in Russian.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.444
Oh, in Russian?

13:24.444 --> 13:27.306
Ah, beh, veh, yeow, byee...

13:27.306 --> 13:28.962
I guess that's the
Fairfax County School Board

13:28.962 --> 13:31.962
hedging a bet.
That's great, honey.

13:31.962 --> 13:34.306
Making spies one
first grader at a time.

13:39.996 --> 13:41.755
I love you.

13:41.755 --> 13:43.927
I'd say be careful,
but I know it's bad luck.

13:43.927 --> 13:46.858
It's not that it's bad luck,
it's pointless.

13:46.858 --> 13:48.755
Okay, see you soon.

13:48.755 --> 13:50.996
Be careful.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.444
She got ya there.

13:52.444 --> 13:54.962
Yeah. I will.

13:54.962 --> 13:57.444
Big hug. Bigger.

14:00.893 --> 14:02.582
You didn't say it back.

14:05.962 --> 14:07.341
I love you.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.686
Call you when I can.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.824
How'd it go?

14:28.824 --> 14:30.375
Good.

14:34.065 --> 14:37.755
She owned it.
Which is... good.

14:39.168 --> 14:40.927
What about you?

14:42.789 --> 14:43.789
I owned it too.

14:45.444 --> 14:48.582
Sounds like
a pretty good place to start.

14:48.582 --> 14:50.962
What do you think about
becoming a station chief?

14:52.065 --> 14:53.582
Then I'm gone all the time.

14:53.582 --> 14:54.651
Somewhere you can
take the family.

14:54.651 --> 14:55.858
Somewhere like London.

14:55.858 --> 14:57.375
They're still a target.

14:57.375 --> 14:58.962
Well, you have to
think of something.

14:58.962 --> 15:01.548
Because my marriage shouldn't
be your goal, Joe...

15:01.548 --> 15:04.065
In the meantime, let's see if
we can unfuck this situation.

15:04.065 --> 15:05.824
Your team is
en route to Lackland.

15:05.824 --> 15:08.479
We rendezvous there?

15:08.479 --> 15:10.100
Gotta see the boss first.

15:36.513 --> 15:38.065
These for us, right?

15:38.065 --> 15:40.479
- You the CAG team?
- Don't know what that means.

15:40.479 --> 15:42.168
- Delta?
- Never heard of 'em.

15:42.168 --> 15:44.444
Whatever the fuck you
guys call yourselves.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.203
We go by nuthin'.
And neither do you.

15:46.203 --> 15:47.927
Neither do you, 'sir'.
I'm a lieutenant.

15:47.927 --> 15:49.134
I don't give a shit.

15:49.134 --> 15:51.134
- Which hangar is ours?
- Seventeen.

15:51.134 --> 15:53.962
- They set up chow and cots?
- It's squared away.

15:53.962 --> 15:56.134
Hope you're talking
about your food.

15:56.134 --> 15:57.134
I don't want to get in
there and see a bunch

15:57.134 --> 15:58.755
of fucking cold cuts.

15:58.755 --> 15:59.893
Officers' catering
is set up in the hangar.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.755
You got couches, cable TV,

16:01.755 --> 16:04.686
plywood walls on rollers,
looks like a cigar lounge now.

16:04.686 --> 16:05.789
Good.

16:05.789 --> 16:07.651
Where's my cigar, chief?

16:27.651 --> 16:29.134
What?

16:29.134 --> 16:30.962
Fucking mean "what?"

16:30.962 --> 16:32.962
I lend you my team
and you fucking hang me.

16:32.962 --> 16:34.858
Well, In case
you haven't noticed,

16:34.858 --> 16:38.065
I'm pretty fucking hung, too.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.237
That sounds different when
I say it, doesn't it?

16:40.237 --> 16:43.168
- What I meant was--
- I know what you meant.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.272
Your intel better
fucking be spot on--

16:45.272 --> 16:46.962
My intel is solid.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.582
The house on the
border is wired,

16:48.582 --> 16:50.893
house in San Antonio's got
so many fucking cameras

16:50.893 --> 16:52.996
we could shoot
a God damn reality show.

16:52.996 --> 16:54.617
That's what
I'm fucking worried about.

16:54.617 --> 16:56.203
Let's go.

17:03.927 --> 17:05.134
Down here.

17:05.134 --> 17:06.962
I want you close enough
that if I yell

17:06.962 --> 17:08.100
you can feel my fucking breath.

17:10.306 --> 17:12.617
You ran an illegal
operation on U.S. soil

17:12.617 --> 17:15.306
that violates our
rules of engagement.

17:15.306 --> 17:19.272
U.S. Code 1385 that limits our
ability to operate on US soil.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.031
You know, I've given that
a lot of thought, actually,

17:21.031 --> 17:23.893
and USC 1385 relates specifically

17:23.893 --> 17:27.272
to military being deployed
to enforce domestic policy.

17:27.272 --> 17:29.651
Sorry, did you obtain a law
degree that I'm unaware of?

17:29.651 --> 17:30.962
Actually, I did.
I don't know if you know,

17:30.962 --> 17:32.686
I have a degree in
constitutional law.

17:32.686 --> 17:34.306
If I may, Deputy Director...
Be my guest.

17:34.306 --> 17:36.858
You keep giving answers
to question he hasn't even asked

17:36.858 --> 17:38.720
so shut the fuck up.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.100
When we want to hear
you speak

17:40.100 --> 17:41.651
we will tell you
to fucking speak.

17:43.203 --> 17:44.341
Yes, ma'am.

17:44.341 --> 17:46.168
Thank you, Kaitlyn.

17:46.168 --> 17:49.100
Fortunately for you,
the intel is good.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.617
It's actionable.

17:51.617 --> 17:53.686
Joe, your team is on
standby in San Antonio.

17:53.686 --> 17:58.065
You will have tactical command,
but Kyle is lead.

17:58.065 --> 18:00.755
San Antonio SWAT
will provide cover,

18:00.755 --> 18:02.996
and they will take credit
if the mission is successful.

18:02.996 --> 18:04.996
They will likely arrest you
if the mission fails

18:04.996 --> 18:07.031
or somehow finds its way
onto the streets.

18:08.858 --> 18:11.031
Does your intel indicate
whether San Antonio

18:11.031 --> 18:12.375
is a way station or target?

18:12.375 --> 18:14.031
It appears to
be a way station.

18:14.031 --> 18:15.858
Our surveillance hasn't
seen any footage

18:15.858 --> 18:19.306
of IED materials or weapons
located on the premises.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.755
Okay, this is not
capture/kill.

18:21.755 --> 18:23.755
This is capture only.

18:23.755 --> 18:25.237
San Antonio SWAT can't explain

18:25.237 --> 18:27.341
a half-dozen dead
foreign nationals.

18:27.341 --> 18:31.996
So you do it quiet,
and you do it clean.

18:31.996 --> 18:34.031
Have I made myself clear?

18:34.031 --> 18:36.065
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

18:36.065 --> 18:37.272
Kyle, you're dismissed.

18:49.065 --> 18:51.755
The assets that I have given
you to complete your mission

18:51.755 --> 18:55.996
are just that: they are <i>my</i>
assets that I allow you to use.

18:55.996 --> 18:57.755
For missions that I approve.

18:57.755 --> 18:59.686
I don't care if you witness
a car jacking

18:59.686 --> 19:01.237
in a church parking lot,

19:01.237 --> 19:05.720
you do not deploy that
team without my permission.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.375
Is that understood?

19:07.375 --> 19:09.375
Yes, sir.

19:09.375 --> 19:11.306
We owe a lot of favors
for this cowboy shit.

19:11.306 --> 19:15.134
I don't care how good the intel,
ops are planned here.

19:15.134 --> 19:16.996
Not on the back
of a fucking napkin.

19:16.996 --> 19:18.341
Understood, sir.

19:20.237 --> 19:21.720
Go to San Antonio.

19:31.341 --> 19:32.686
Why are you stopping?

19:35.341 --> 19:36.306
I thought you wanted to talk.

19:36.306 --> 19:37.893
We can talk on the plane.

19:39.168 --> 19:40.755
Are you coming?

19:40.755 --> 19:41.789
That's how much
trouble you're in.

19:57.962 --> 19:59.410
- Bobby?
- Yeah.

19:59.410 --> 20:01.755
What the fuck
is she doing here?

20:01.755 --> 20:03.306
They sent us here.

20:03.306 --> 20:05.134
They sent the team here.

20:05.134 --> 20:07.031
That's not the team,
that's the asset.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.720
The asset.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.031
Yeah, you think
I'm going to let you end up

20:10.031 --> 20:11.755
on the news coming
out of a safe house?

20:11.755 --> 20:13.755
Or worse,
eating a bullet inside it?

20:13.755 --> 20:15.375
Bet I've kicked down
more doors than you have.

20:15.375 --> 20:18.824
- I highly doubt it.
- A word, boss?

20:18.824 --> 20:21.134
So, I was told there was
six targets in this house.

20:21.134 --> 20:23.410
- Correct.
- Okay, well,

20:23.410 --> 20:25.824
With you we're just six.

20:25.824 --> 20:29.720
So, what, are we in the business
of fair fights now?

20:29.720 --> 20:31.824
Come on, you know this
is a two squad minimum.

20:31.824 --> 20:33.375
And I don't know about you,
but I don't feel like

20:33.375 --> 20:35.410
rushing this place with
a fucking SWAT team.

20:35.410 --> 20:36.962
It's not what they do.

20:41.203 --> 20:42.893
Just keep her in
the back of the line.

20:43.893 --> 20:45.789
Roger that.

20:45.789 --> 20:47.341
All right, listen up.

20:47.341 --> 20:48.755
These photos were
taken yesterday

20:48.755 --> 20:50.065
at a safe house in Alpine.

20:50.065 --> 20:52.444
Targets left five hours ago,

20:52.444 --> 20:54.306
which should put them
at the San Antonio location

20:54.306 --> 20:56.341
sometime in
the next twenty minutes.

20:56.341 --> 20:58.824
We do not know how long
they are held there

20:58.824 --> 21:00.203
until their next leg, so

21:00.203 --> 21:01.824
assuming they are on
time this evening,

21:01.824 --> 21:03.548
we hit the house
at 0400,

21:03.548 --> 21:07.927
Door locks are electronic,
gate code is 7358.

21:07.927 --> 21:10.031
One four-man team enters
from the front,

21:10.031 --> 21:11.548
another one from the rear.

21:11.548 --> 21:13.996
There are two beds in each
of the three bedrooms,

21:13.996 --> 21:15.927
which leads us to believe
two per room.

21:15.927 --> 21:17.444
We're not going to
have to guess

21:17.444 --> 21:19.858
because we have
video until we breech.

21:19.858 --> 21:23.203
At that point, power will be cut
and overwatch will be blind.

21:23.203 --> 21:25.444
Now, listen up,
this is important.

21:25.444 --> 21:27.444
This is a capture only mission.

21:27.444 --> 21:29.375
That is not negotiable.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.444
If for some reason
this goes to shit,

21:32.444 --> 21:35.893
they got a cache of
weapons and they are prepared,

21:35.893 --> 21:38.444
so we fall back, we let
San Antonio SWAT take over.

21:38.444 --> 21:40.306
Wait, wait, wait...

21:40.306 --> 21:42.927
So you're saying if we're
fired upon we can't...

21:42.927 --> 21:46.100
we can't
return fire and save our ass?

21:46.100 --> 21:48.203
I'm saying you lay
suppressive fire

21:48.203 --> 21:49.548
and pray to God
you don't hit anybody.

21:49.548 --> 21:51.410
What the fuck?

21:51.410 --> 21:55.065
Let me walk you through the
gravity of the situation here.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.893
We have one chance to
give Border Patrol

21:56.893 --> 21:59.513
and DPS a prize big enough

21:59.513 --> 22:02.134
that they will look the other
way from the shit show

22:02.134 --> 22:04.375
you created in Van Horn.

22:04.375 --> 22:09.031
If this becomes a shit show
as well, there is no prize,

22:09.031 --> 22:10.858
everyone runs for cover,

22:10.858 --> 22:12.962
and you are all left standing
in the middle of the street

22:12.962 --> 22:15.893
with your pants
around your ankles.

22:15.893 --> 22:17.996
Got it?

22:17.996 --> 22:20.272
Border Patrol won't lend
us their Tactics team?

22:20.272 --> 22:22.065
Eight on six doesn't
make quick and quiet.

22:22.065 --> 22:24.375
This is our mess,
we clean it up.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.065
You've got movement
at the house.

22:50.168 --> 22:53.134
- Gun.
- I see it.

22:53.134 --> 22:54.479
- That's fucking great.
- They're armed.

22:54.479 --> 22:56.927
Let me see if we can
get some latitude.

23:02.617 --> 23:04.100
Uh-oh.

23:10.444 --> 23:11.548
Kaitlyn.

23:15.203 --> 23:17.272
Are there any big sporting
events planned for tomorrow?

23:17.272 --> 23:18.996
Why do you say tomorrow?

23:18.996 --> 23:21.203
Would you set a bomb
beside your bed for a week?

23:21.203 --> 23:23.134
When they arm them,
they use them.

23:23.134 --> 23:24.444
Actually, Bob, I'm gonna
need you to come down here.

23:32.375 --> 23:36.548
Shit. This keeps going
from bad to fucking worse.

23:36.548 --> 23:38.513
I hit a house
like this in Pakistan.

23:38.513 --> 23:40.237
But it was capture-kill.

23:40.237 --> 23:41.237
And nobody was
thinking capture.

23:41.237 --> 23:42.582
You take it clean?

23:42.582 --> 23:44.237
Guy in the back of
the house detonated,

23:44.237 --> 23:45.375
took three with him.

23:47.410 --> 23:48.686
There was only
one entrance though.

23:48.686 --> 23:50.237
We just didn't
have enough time.

24:02.410 --> 24:04.410
Joe. Kyle.
Let's go.

24:08.203 --> 24:10.134
We need to run this
up the pole now.

24:10.134 --> 24:11.548
We need Homeland Security,

24:11.548 --> 24:13.410
you need to notify
the Governor's office.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.479
We are on a clock, and we
don't know when it runs out.

24:14.479 --> 24:16.272
What are you gonna do,

24:16.272 --> 24:18.410
have San Antonio SWAT trying
to take them on the street?

24:18.410 --> 24:20.444
They'll blow up the whole
fucking neighborhood.

24:20.444 --> 24:21.444
We have an
HRT team in Houston.

24:21.444 --> 24:22.996
That's too far.

24:22.996 --> 24:24.237
We'd better
decide something fast.

24:24.237 --> 24:25.444
I need to evacuate
the neighborhood.

24:25.444 --> 24:26.686
Well, and how you
plan to do that?

24:26.686 --> 24:28.237
Gonna hit the
civil service siren?

24:28.237 --> 24:30.686
We have BP run it,
take my team on loan.

24:30.686 --> 24:33.306
This is clearly a threat.
We neutralize the threat.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.306
FBI can withhold all evidence

24:35.306 --> 24:38.272
because releasing would
jeopardize national security.

24:38.272 --> 24:39.720
What about
the medical examiner?

24:39.720 --> 24:41.582
A bunch of soldiers
start neutralizing threats

24:41.582 --> 24:43.203
while they're sleeping is
homicide any way you slice it.

24:43.203 --> 24:44.686
You don't have
the protection we have.

24:44.686 --> 24:47.100
I have the answer,
I just don't think

24:47.100 --> 24:48.651
you want to be here
when I say it.

24:48.651 --> 24:50.100
- Understood.
- Yeah.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.100
- I'll step away.
- Thank you.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.479
You have engineers
in San Antonio?

24:53.479 --> 24:56.100
El Paso. I have a bomb
unit in Laughlin.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.410
I can have them
here in three hours.

24:57.410 --> 24:59.065
We neutralize the threat.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.203
Close down the scene until bomb
squad has secured,

25:01.203 --> 25:02.582
which they won't.

25:02.582 --> 25:04.100
And then we evacuate
the neighborhood

25:04.100 --> 25:07.755
and detonate the bombs in place.

25:07.755 --> 25:09.031
And with it...

25:11.341 --> 25:12.720
Got it.

25:15.168 --> 25:17.306
You up for playing
outside the lines tonight?

25:17.306 --> 25:18.824
Your team better be
pretty fucking special.

25:18.824 --> 25:20.237
This is what we do.

25:20.237 --> 25:21.410
Send 'em in.

25:22.617 --> 25:23.755
Gear up.
You're green.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.272
Yes, ma'am.

25:25.272 --> 25:27.306
New deal. Weapons free.
We clear the scene.

25:27.306 --> 25:28.651
- When do we move?
- Right now.

25:31.513 --> 25:33.548
- What about me?
- What about you?

25:35.134 --> 25:36.272
This I know.

25:37.582 --> 25:38.720
Gear up.

25:42.272 --> 25:45.065
When we reach the site,
kill the power.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.548
We don't want
recordings of this shit.

25:46.548 --> 25:48.548
When our boots hit
the ground, kill the power.

25:48.548 --> 25:50.031
You got it.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.375
What are you smiling about?

25:58.375 --> 26:00.858
I haven't had this
much fun since Iraq.

26:00.858 --> 26:02.582
You're such an asshole, Kyle.

26:02.582 --> 26:04.444
Yeah, but I'm good looking.

26:04.444 --> 26:06.548
That makes it worse,
you know that?

26:06.548 --> 26:08.237
Fucking asshole,
you can't even insult him.

26:08.237 --> 26:10.134
All right,
we're leaving in five.

26:10.134 --> 26:11.272
Let's go.

26:50.168 --> 26:52.134
Kyle, are you fucking
wearing cologne?

26:53.410 --> 26:55.789
I remember you now.
Baghdad. 2011.

26:55.789 --> 26:58.272
Yep. I was there.

26:58.272 --> 27:00.341
He wore that shit
back then, too.

27:15.651 --> 27:16.617
You stay right behind me.

27:16.617 --> 27:17.962
You should stay behind me.

27:17.962 --> 27:19.548
If you go into this trying
to protect her,

27:19.548 --> 27:20.927
you're going to get killed.

27:20.927 --> 27:22.789
You go into this trying
to prove yourself,

27:22.789 --> 27:24.410
you're getting killed.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.479
The only mission is
the mission you're on.

27:25.479 --> 27:26.617
Yes, ma'am.

27:26.617 --> 27:29.548
- Joe?
- I hear you.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.513
- Joe.
- Understood.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.893
We're in position.
Power off.

29:02.031 --> 29:04.651
Hallway right.

29:05.858 --> 29:07.444
Going left.

29:11.962 --> 29:13.651
On me.

29:15.031 --> 29:17.065
Fuck.
Cruz, hold your position!

29:20.686 --> 29:21.789
Allahu ak--

29:25.479 --> 29:27.065
What the fuck are you doing?

29:27.065 --> 29:28.341
Saving your life.

29:31.789 --> 29:34.582
E.K.I.A. wearing suicide
vest room 3.

29:34.582 --> 29:37.410
Move off target.

29:37.410 --> 29:38.927
Almost like we do this
for a living.

29:38.927 --> 29:39.927
This one activated his vest.

29:39.927 --> 29:41.444
Even better.

29:41.444 --> 29:43.341
Overwatch, this is QRF 2,
house is secure.

29:43.341 --> 29:44.651
<i>One bandit activated IED.</i>

29:44.651 --> 29:46.582
<i>Request bomb squad
and engineers, over.</i>

29:46.582 --> 29:48.617
<i>Copy, QRF 2,
bomb squad is present.</i>

29:48.617 --> 29:51.444
<i>Exit the house and they will
assume control of the scene.</i>

30:03.031 --> 30:04.858
One of them had
a suicide vest.

30:04.858 --> 30:06.548
It activated.

30:06.548 --> 30:08.755
We've surrendered the scene
to the bomb squad.

30:08.755 --> 30:10.686
I highly recommend you evacuate
the neighborhood,

30:10.686 --> 30:15.065
it's likely they'll need to
blow the ordinance in place.

30:15.065 --> 30:16.375
Well played, agent.

30:18.996 --> 30:20.065
It's not a game, sir.

30:36.548 --> 30:39.444
You don't smell like cologne
anymore, do you,

30:39.444 --> 30:40.996
you rank motherfucker.

30:43.893 --> 30:46.031
I think that's you.

30:46.031 --> 30:47.479
Fuck you.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.444
No, he's right.
It's you.

30:51.375 --> 30:52.479
Good job.

30:58.893 --> 31:00.375
What do I tell her?

31:02.513 --> 31:05.858
Aaliyah.
What do I tell her?

31:07.548 --> 31:09.065
It's been three days.

31:09.065 --> 31:10.720
I don't know.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.617
Tell her the truth.
Just leave out the names.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.582
The truth?

31:16.582 --> 31:18.617
The best lies
are wrapped in it.

31:39.720 --> 31:40.893
Let me get back to you.

31:44.548 --> 31:46.893
- Long one.
- Not short.

31:46.893 --> 31:49.031
If I guess where
do I get a prize?

31:49.031 --> 31:50.548
You'll never guess where.

31:50.548 --> 31:52.375
San Antonio.

31:52.375 --> 31:53.824
<i>Border Patrol officials
were compelled</i>

31:53.824 --> 31:55.824
<i>to blow the explosives
in place</i>

31:55.824 --> 31:58.375
<i>destroying the house where
the terrorists were staying,</i>

31:58.375 --> 32:00.720
<i>and with it any likely
motive or target...</i>

32:00.720 --> 32:02.582
Little heads-up
would have been nice.

32:02.582 --> 32:04.962
You know what this has
done to oil prices?

32:04.962 --> 32:07.927
I want to invite our girls
over for supper.

32:07.927 --> 32:10.065
Bad week for it.

32:10.065 --> 32:12.617
That wasn't a question.

32:12.617 --> 32:15.444
I'm inviting our daughters
over for dinner.

32:15.444 --> 32:17.410
Don't make plans.

32:19.962 --> 32:21.513
It's gonna happen again.

32:21.513 --> 32:23.168
Where?

32:23.168 --> 32:25.996
- Don't know.
- When?

32:25.996 --> 32:29.789
- Not sure.
- Then how do you know?

32:29.789 --> 32:31.962
They're coming in through
Mexico using the cartels

32:31.962 --> 32:33.789
and we can't stop them.

32:36.927 --> 32:38.755
And now the whole world knows.

32:40.617 --> 32:42.100
I'm going to take a shower.

33:00.755 --> 33:02.272
What did I miss?

33:02.272 --> 33:04.031
Whole bunch of this.

33:07.065 --> 33:09.582
Pain was pretty bad last night,
so upped her morphine.

33:11.168 --> 33:12.100
Morphine?

33:14.272 --> 33:16.962
Of the opioids available
it is the lesser of all evils.

33:16.962 --> 33:18.962
Yeah. Yeah.

33:18.962 --> 33:21.479
Trying to get this damn
thing set up for her.

33:29.548 --> 33:31.134
Rough night?

33:31.134 --> 33:33.789
Yeah.

33:33.789 --> 33:35.031
Believe it or not,
I've had worse.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.134
Well that's terrifying.

33:38.134 --> 33:39.893
Yeah.

34:01.306 --> 34:03.617
Did ISIS come
to Baltimore, Joe,

34:03.617 --> 34:05.168
or am I married to
a fucking hit man now?

34:50.134 --> 34:52.651
NFL network replays
games in the morning.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.237
You are the perfect woman.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.100
Fuck.

35:25.168 --> 35:26.755
You hate me?

35:26.755 --> 35:28.375
Why would I hate you?

35:28.375 --> 35:30.720
I begged them to go back
for you, but the security

35:30.720 --> 35:33.341
pushed us out.

35:33.341 --> 35:34.375
FaceTime me.

35:36.824 --> 35:40.755
Uh, no.
I look like hell.

35:40.755 --> 35:43.858
That's not possible.
FaceTime me. Please.

35:47.134 --> 35:51.306
Yeah. Yeah, just...
give me two minutes.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.444
Hey. Still in the Hamptons?

36:24.444 --> 36:25.720
Where are you?

36:25.720 --> 36:29.306
Dorm... Show me.

36:29.306 --> 36:32.375
There's not much to see.

36:32.375 --> 36:33.996
Show me anyway.

36:33.996 --> 36:36.134
No, I'm embarrassed.

36:36.134 --> 36:37.858
I don't have your money.

36:37.858 --> 36:40.031
That's one of the things
I like about you.

36:41.927 --> 36:43.962
I want to see it,
it's where you live.

36:43.962 --> 36:47.203
Mm-mm, you're stuck
looking at my face.

36:49.100 --> 36:50.272
And what torture that is.

36:53.410 --> 36:55.341
Fine, I'll look at your face.

36:59.065 --> 37:02.789
<i>We are lady and the tramp,
you and I.</i>

37:02.789 --> 37:06.065
Except you are a lady, too,

37:06.065 --> 37:09.100
so we are lady
and the lady tramp.

37:10.410 --> 37:12.789
Okay.

37:12.789 --> 37:14.824
Weekdays here are the best.

37:16.341 --> 37:18.134
New bathing suit.

37:25.341 --> 37:27.272
For making the boys crazy.

37:28.479 --> 37:31.824
<i>Come back up.</i>
- No, I can't.

37:31.824 --> 37:33.893
You can.

37:33.893 --> 37:36.134
No, I don't like your friends.

37:36.134 --> 37:38.031
They are gone.
I'm all alone.

38:10.168 --> 38:11.479
Hey.
