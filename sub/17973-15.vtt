Hey, I know you, Jack.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.483
You're the whitest black man
in America.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.484
Not anymore.

10:19.486 --> 10:22.253
Take me

10:22.255 --> 10:24.489

11:15.308 --> 11:17.308
Jheri curl wearin'-ass
friends down here

11:17.310 --> 11:19.144
to shoot at me and my homies!

11:19.146 --> 11:22.213
Cleveland, why are you quoting
box office masterpiece <i>Friday?</i>

11:22.215 --> 11:25.116
'Cause I'm a black man now, and
that's what black people do.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.251
Now, Donna, how come you ain't

11:26.253 --> 11:28.353
got no pictures of no brothas
up on the wall?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.588
Cleveland, that is your brother
Broderick.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.525
Blowin' by it! Now, it's the
hottest day of the year,

11:33.527 --> 11:35.360
there's racial tension
everywhere,

11:35.362 --> 11:37.295
and we ain't
patronizing your pizzeria

11:37.297 --> 11:39.931
till there's some
brothas up on that wall!

11:39.933 --> 11:42.834
Isn't that right, supporting
actress Rosie Perez?

11:42.836 --> 11:44.335
Yeah!

11:44.337 --> 11:45.470
<i>Do The Right Thing!</i>

11:45.472 --> 11:47.338
Aaaah!

11:47.340 --> 11:49.674
Oh, my balled-up papers
and toenails.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.342
Oh, Cleveland, being black

11:51.344 --> 11:53.611
isn't about this
stereotypical nonsense.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.147
It's about being comfortable
in your own skin.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.649
You need help.

11:57.651 --> 12:00.819
Well, since black people don't
believe in therapy, I'm gonna go

12:00.821 --> 12:04.289
think on this while I wash my
car in a public park.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.424
Is that even a black
stereotype?!

12:06.426 --> 12:07.826
I've seen 'em do it.

12:07.828 --> 12:12.430
Oh, maybe I'll find what
I'm looking for at church.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.733
What was T-Pain doing here?

12:17.002 --> 12:19.003
Thank you for meeting
with me, Reverend.

12:19.005 --> 12:22.173
I need guidance.
I don't know who I am.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.776
Cleveland, I can tell
your heart is heavy...

12:24.778 --> 12:25.844
Yes.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.146
You're weary and
in need of rest...

12:28.148 --> 12:29.514
So weary.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.516
Tempted by the
lust of flesh...

12:31.518 --> 12:32.517
Yep!

12:32.519 --> 12:34.953
And homosexuality.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.254
Noooooo.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.822
Just a hunch.

12:37.824 --> 12:42.327
Son, I am reminded of Urkel's
letter to the Alopecians.

12:42.329 --> 12:45.196
You must trust in
the Bruce Almighty,

12:45.198 --> 12:47.665
who brought forth the
loaves and the fish,

12:47.667 --> 12:51.136
and the bubble gum,
bubble gum in a dish.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.772
How many pieces do you wish?

12:53.774 --> 12:57.308
Reverend, how is this supposed
to help me figure out who I am?

12:57.310 --> 12:59.043
Don't worry, my son,

12:59.045 --> 13:02.514
you can always turn to the
Father in your time of need.

13:02.516 --> 13:05.183
My father...
Thanks, Reverend.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.485
And I'll take some of
that bubble gum.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.189
Ooh, as ye Hubba,

13:11.191 --> 13:12.791
so shall ye Bubba!

13:12.793 --> 13:16.694
(chanting scream)

13:16.696 --> 13:18.530
Bye!

13:23.269 --> 13:24.803
Uhp!
Seven years.

13:24.805 --> 13:28.206
Dad, Mom, I have
a question for you.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.275
Young man, did you give me my
kiss yet?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.277
Yam, yam, yam.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.212
Oh, that's better.
You were saying?

13:34.214 --> 13:38.116
What happened in my past that
makes people say I'm so white?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.652
Well, we should
probably tell you...

13:40.654 --> 13:42.654
Cookie! You got
nothing to tell him.

13:42.656 --> 13:46.257
You had the loving childhood
everyone dreams about, fatass!

13:46.259 --> 13:48.493
Now get out of my house!

13:48.495 --> 13:50.195
Good-bye, Cleveland.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.996
There's a woman who
can answer your questions.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.799
Remember this address.
One-two-three Main Street.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.434
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
One more time.

13:56.436 --> 14:02.106
One... two... three...
Main Street.

14:02.108 --> 14:06.344
Okay. One-two is like 12,
divided by three is four.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.380
Four letters in "rain" which
rhymes with "Main." Got it.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.915
Why you hugging
your momma so long?

14:10.917 --> 14:14.152
No reason. Bye.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.653
(doorbell rings)

14:15.655 --> 14:16.754
One more time.

14:18.324 --> 14:20.658
(doorbell chimes)

14:20.660 --> 14:23.194
(gasps) Cleveland Brown!

14:23.196 --> 14:25.096
White lady I've never seen
before!

14:25.098 --> 14:28.499
(laughs) I practically
raised you, Cleveland.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.335
I'm your Nanny Barbara.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.536
What?

14:31.538 --> 14:34.205
Look at you...
all grown up.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.608
My Cleveland has
come back to me.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.509
Party over here!

14:38.511 --> 14:41.246
We'll be white black.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.653
Do you still like Arnold
Palmers, Cleveland?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.955
Well, I do, but only
if I have an...

14:50.957 --> 14:52.857
almond biscotti.
Almond biscotti?

14:52.859 --> 14:55.994
What kind of mind
wizard are you?

14:57.830 --> 14:59.530
Why don't I remember you?

14:59.532 --> 15:03.167
Well, you were very young and
when your father came back

15:03.169 --> 15:06.271
into your mother's life,
I wasn't needed anymore.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.173
And you always were
a rather thick,

15:09.175 --> 15:11.042
unresponsive child,

15:11.044 --> 15:12.343
so it doesn't surprise me

15:12.345 --> 15:14.545
that you remember so little of
those days.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.815
Rhoda.
What?

15:17.817 --> 15:19.450
We used to watch
Mary Tyler Moore

15:19.452 --> 15:21.185
and her funny neighbor Rhoda.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.254
Wait, what was funny
about her again?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.290
She was Jewish.
(laughs)

15:25.292 --> 15:28.159
Oh my God, I remember!
You took me trick-or-treating.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.194
You were Siskel
and I was Ebert.

15:30.196 --> 15:31.696
Now you're getting it.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.699
(laughs)

15:34.701 --> 15:38.069
Cleveland, it's time you
get back to your roots!

15:41.774 --> 15:43.308
Afternoon, Ms. Barbara.

15:43.310 --> 15:48.112
(gasps) Why, you're little
Master Cleveland, all grown up!

15:48.114 --> 15:50.281
You remember me?
No.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.017
Good. Good.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.587
I'm telling you,
I don't know how to...

15:57.456 --> 15:59.958
Whoa. Love-15.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.626
(gasps) Where did
that come from?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.127
(chuckles)

16:03.129 --> 16:06.030
Next thing, you'll tell me you
don't know how to play bridge.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.832
Overtrick, bitches!

16:07.834 --> 16:10.101
Sorry, Elliot, Bunny.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.102
Thank you, Barbara.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.805
You've helped me figure
out who I really am.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.840
I want you to
meet my family.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.208
They're... (clears throat)

16:17.210 --> 16:18.209
...black.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.510
WAITER:
I heard that!

16:19.512 --> 16:20.578
Let's go!

16:26.285 --> 16:28.586
Stuff from Trader Joe's!

16:28.588 --> 16:31.656
You gave him Barbara's
number, didn't you?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.926
Family? I know you have
a lot of questions.

16:34.928 --> 16:37.295
Now, remember the white woman of
a certain age

16:37.297 --> 16:39.964
I hustled through the living
room into the kitchen

16:39.966 --> 16:43.468
15 minutes ago saying,
"No questions, no questions"?

16:43.470 --> 16:44.502
I do.

16:44.504 --> 16:48.339
Family, meet my
childhood nanny, Barbara.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.009
Hello, Freight Train.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.177
Hello, Evelyn.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.147
(British accent):
Barbara, how do you do?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.316
(normal voice):
Ha! I'm just kidding.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.785
I can interact with other human
beings of different racial

17:00.787 --> 17:03.788
and ethnic backgrounds without
losing my own identity.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.790
Is that helpful? Is that
helpful to your husband

17:05.792 --> 17:07.525
who is trying to
figure out who he is?

17:17.369 --> 17:19.871
All right, I'll say it.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.106
What the (bleep)
going on here?

17:22.108 --> 17:23.541
I'll tell you
what's going on.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.710
This woman never did
no good for nobody.

17:25.712 --> 17:26.878
What did I tell you?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.479
Barbara helped me raise
Cleveland

17:28.481 --> 17:31.015
when Freight Train went out to
get a pack of cigarettes

17:31.017 --> 17:32.617
for three and a half years.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.452
You said you was
gonna let that go.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.454
Hey, you ever
been married?

17:36.456 --> 17:38.089
No.

17:38.091 --> 17:41.859
I haven't met
the right person.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.795
Ohh...
Ohh...

17:43.797 --> 17:45.863
There's a little
vanilla on that Cookie.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.165
There it is.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.800
You happy, Tubby?!

17:48.802 --> 17:51.002
Humiliate me in front
of my step-grandson?!

17:51.004 --> 17:53.805
You walking around like
the rich guy on <i>Gilligan.</i>

17:53.807 --> 17:55.940
Interesting fact.
None of them got rich

17:55.942 --> 17:59.677
because back then, actors didn't
get residuals.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.846
Heard that on NPR this morning.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.115
Oh, please. All this
fuss 'cause you got

18:04.117 --> 18:06.484
embarrassed that your
son liked Justin Bieber.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.986
What?
You were embarrassed by me?

18:08.988 --> 18:10.788
This is unprecedented.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.891
I'm so upset, I could storm up
to my room.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.994
Everybody, calm down!

18:16.996 --> 18:19.263
Let's remember
what this is all about.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.333
I am finally at peace with
who I am.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.335
Until next week, when
you go to a P.F. Chang's

18:24.337 --> 18:27.839
and think you're Chinese
'cause you like fried rice.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.607
Me so offended!

18:29.609 --> 18:32.009
Oh, it's not my
fault I'm confused.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.711
Look what I came from!

18:33.713 --> 18:35.613
Oh, boo-hoo.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.748
"Am I black? Am I white?"

18:37.750 --> 18:40.351
You're the same thing you've
always been... nothing.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.320
Whoa.
Just got real.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.922
You're wrong!
I am somebody!

18:44.924 --> 18:47.325
I just don't know who!

18:47.327 --> 18:50.161
I better go after him.
