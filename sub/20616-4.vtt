WEBVTT

00:10.111 --> 00:12.678
Over here is really bad.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.147
It breeds psychopaths.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.384
I've been jumped.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.386
He is breaking her neck.

00:21.956 --> 00:24.590
I had to get out of the building
as quickly as I possibly could.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.327
The dead can't rest.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.429
I'm convinced it was
a homicide.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.232
He likes killing people.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.768
This is not a good situation.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.636
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.238
There's death here.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.973
Don't wanna go down there.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.241
I see dead people.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.343
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.012
I speak to dead people...

00:47.014 --> 00:49.815
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.617
...and they speak to me.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.786
She's going to torture them.

00:53.788 --> 00:57.589
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.725
They were all murdered.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.226
I rely on my partner.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.795
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.596
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.299
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:07.301 --> 01:10.869
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.871 --> 01:14.940
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.642
It's my job to reveal them.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.277
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:18.279 --> 01:20.446
But Steve and I
never speak...

01:20.448 --> 01:22.481
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.715
...until the very end.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.350
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.419
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:27.421 --> 01:28.921
<i>Hell,</i> no.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.589
Or time to get out.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.591
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

01:47.074 --> 01:48.974
I'm out here
in Sauk Centre, Minnesota.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.877
It's about 100 miles northwest
of Minneapolis.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.612
I got called in
by a woman named Kelley.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.448
Now she thought she was
doing a good thing for her town

01:56.450 --> 01:58.684
by buying and restoring
an historic hotel.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.919
But no good deed
goes unpunished.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.122
Activity in the building
is out of control,

02:03.124 --> 02:06.758
but she says she's not leaving
no matter what,

02:06.760 --> 02:10.195
so it's up to me and Amy
to find a solution.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.368
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the area

02:16.370 --> 02:20.072
of any leading information.

02:20.074 --> 02:21.573
This is a large space,

02:21.575 --> 02:25.444
and there are a lot of
historical photos and antiques.

02:25.446 --> 02:29.481
I need to cover or remove each
and every one of them.

02:29.483 --> 02:33.685
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.967
There's, like,
a dead guy here.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.203
He's, like, being a stalker.

02:51.205 --> 02:56.175
All you see is a skeleton
with, like, sharp teeth,

02:56.177 --> 02:58.477
and he has a woman,
and he's holding her

02:58.479 --> 03:01.246
by the back
of her head and neck.

03:04.151 --> 03:08.687
He indicated that he murdered
her along with others.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.656
He is a killer.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.465
So, Kelley, when we spoke
on the phone,

03:20.467 --> 03:21.567
you sounded really upset

03:21.569 --> 03:23.168
about the things that are
happening here.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.937
I'm really glad you're here.

03:24.939 --> 03:29.374
The Palmer house is
so incredibly important to me.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.277
I want it to be here
for generations to come,

03:32.279 --> 03:35.514
and with the type of activity
that's going on,

03:35.516 --> 03:37.683
it's become a real concern,

03:37.685 --> 03:42.454
and now I begin to wonder
if it's even safe.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.590
What are some of
the experiences
people are having?

03:44.592 --> 03:47.092
There's been a lot of things
that are going on,

03:47.094 --> 03:49.194
hearing footsteps,

03:49.196 --> 03:51.663
objects being moved,

03:51.665 --> 03:55.834
shadow figures,
and, in some cases,

03:55.836 --> 03:59.137
people are being
touched and pushed.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.540
I got to think, with all
the activity that's going on,

04:01.542 --> 04:03.075
it's got to be bad
for business.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.544
I definitely think
it is.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.847
I've had guests that
have left.

04:08.849 --> 04:12.884
It's frequent enough that
I actually created these binders

04:12.886 --> 04:14.653
for guests to be able

04:14.655 --> 04:19.725
to write their experiences down
themselves if they would like.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.864
I got to tell you, this is
pretty interesting stuff.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.600
What about employees?
Are they being affected?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.836
I've had employees
that have quit

04:30.838 --> 04:34.606
and mood shifts happen.
- Okay.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.409
They can become
very quarrelsome,

04:37.411 --> 04:40.145
very argumentative
with one another.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.314
And you think that has something
to do with what's going on here?

04:42.316 --> 04:45.284
I definitely think
it is.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.519
Is it affecting you at all?

04:47.521 --> 04:49.855
Sometimes,
I feel a little anxious

04:49.857 --> 04:54.092
and really angry
and short-tempered,

04:54.094 --> 04:58.330
but I can't imagine my life
anywhere but here.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.631
It has my heart.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.934
I love it with every fiber
of my being.

05:02.936 --> 05:06.138
I want to make it work,
but I need it to be safe.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.445
I walk in here
and my stomach drops,

05:13.447 --> 05:17.349
and I hear a woman
crying and screaming.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.188
This living woman,
she's just losing her...

05:26.727 --> 05:29.127
The killer,
the skeleton face dude,

05:29.129 --> 05:32.431
he's making me feel
extremely stressed out.

05:35.636 --> 05:39.204
Also, the living people here
will feel,

05:39.206 --> 05:42.174
sudden, extreme nausea

05:42.176 --> 05:44.576
and projectile vomiting.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.150
Okay, Kelley.
So what's going gonna in here?

05:52.152 --> 05:54.753
There's just sometimes
that I end up

05:54.755 --> 05:58.523
getting really sick
with no explanation.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.659
Okay. What kind of sick?
What are we talking about?

06:00.661 --> 06:05.397
Extreme nausea and terrible,
terrible headaches.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.533
When you're away from here,
does the symptoms go away?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.369
Yes, they do.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.603
Okay. Anything else?

06:11.605 --> 06:15.006
There's many times
I'm hearing voices.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.275
Okay.
So what kind of voices?

06:17.277 --> 06:18.677
Male, female.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.947
Sometimes, it's even children
laughing and playing.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.916
Kelley, in the building here,
I can hear people outside.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.319
I can hear people in the back,
here in the kitchen.

06:27.321 --> 06:28.820
How do you know
it's not that?

06:28.822 --> 06:31.990
There's many occasions
when it's happened,

06:31.992 --> 06:36.194
and we're already closed
for the night.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.963
Is there anything else
going on in here?

06:37.965 --> 06:39.264
One time, actually,

06:39.266 --> 06:42.134
when I was just passing
through the kitchen,

06:42.136 --> 06:46.772
this bowl on the end here
flew 10 feet across the kitchen.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.410
Well, this can't really
fall off of here.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.779
You're damn lucky that
it's that and not a knife.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.480
My feelings exactly.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.955
I'm seeing this living woman

07:03.957 --> 07:06.591
being pushed out of here.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.664
But I'm hearing, "Thrown,"

07:12.666 --> 07:17.235
and I see that the dead woman,

07:17.237 --> 07:19.304
that the skeleton-face guy
killed,

07:19.306 --> 07:22.174
is the one who's doing it.

07:22.176 --> 07:25.577
I don't think she likes
women very much.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.549
She's very tough.

07:30.551 --> 07:34.686
She's able to physically
interact with the living.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.122
And, yeah,
she doesn't like women.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.797
Okay, Kelley.
What's going on down here?

07:45.799 --> 07:51.369
There's a very,
very large black shadow

07:51.371 --> 07:54.506
that I've seen down here
on multiple occasions.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.808
Can you describe
what it looks like?

07:56.810 --> 08:00.278
Extremely tall,
very broad-shouldered.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.882
Because of the sheer size,
I tend to say man,

08:03.884 --> 08:05.617
but I don't know.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.452
You ever see him anyplace else
in the building?

08:07.454 --> 08:10.021
Sometimes upstairs.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.623
Okay.
Anything else going on?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.725
Well, the reason
I called you in for help

08:13.727 --> 08:17.462
was because I've been
jumped.

08:17.464 --> 08:20.298
What do you mean?
Like a spirit jumped you?

08:20.300 --> 08:23.435
- Yes.
- So what was the feeling like?

08:23.437 --> 08:29.441
It was absolutely like
somebody had complete control

08:29.443 --> 08:32.943
over my body.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.313
Did you get a sense of who
or what it might be?

08:35.315 --> 08:37.082
It felt like a man.

08:37.083 --> 08:40.217
I don't think that he
particularly cared for me.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.486
That was as intense
as it comes.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.955
So what do you think
this thing wants?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.156
You have any idea?

08:45.158 --> 08:48.860
I sometimes wonder if
it just wants me to leave.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.161
I'm not going anywhere.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.763
You're going to fight this.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.666
Every step of the way
for as long as I have to.

08:59.606 --> 09:04.876
This guy with
the skeleton-like face,

09:04.878 --> 09:06.778
I don't feel to comfortable here

09:06.780 --> 09:09.281
because I feel like

09:09.283 --> 09:12.484
I'm constantly having
to push him away from me

09:12.486 --> 09:16.054
because he can jump people.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.661
So are you saying
he's trying to jump you now?

09:22.663 --> 09:26.565
Yes, he's been trying to jump me
the whole time, the whole night.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.834
Do you have any idea
what he wants from the living?

09:29.836 --> 09:33.171
He indicated that
now he's death,

09:33.173 --> 09:34.539
and he's enjoying that.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.608
He likes killing people,

09:36.610 --> 09:39.177
and he would like
to continue doing that.

09:59.499 --> 10:02.200
So, Wyatt, I understand
you live at the hotel.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.470
- How long has that been?
- Been here around 7 months.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.038
Do you think this place
is dangerous?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.840
I wouldn't like to say
it was dangerous,

10:08.842 --> 10:10.075
but there has definitely
been times

10:10.077 --> 10:11.376
where I've been
a little worried.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.711
Okay.
So if you're uncomfortable,

10:12.713 --> 10:14.346
could I assume
you've had experiences?

10:14.348 --> 10:16.081
A few of them, yeah.
Absolutely.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.649
I hear these banging sounds.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.418
It's almost like a 30-pound
weight is being dropped.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.287
All right. So how do you know
it's not guests?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.789
Steve, I've been in this
building when I absolutely know

10:24.791 --> 10:27.993
there has been nobody else
in the building with me.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.561
Okay. Anything else?

10:29.563 --> 10:30.962
I was sleeping one night.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.499
All of a sudden, I felt like
somebody had laid in my bed

10:34.501 --> 10:35.700
and put their arm around me.
- All right.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.370
So can you actually feel
this person net to you?

10:38.372 --> 10:40.772
Yeah, and I could feel
the fingertips

10:40.774 --> 10:42.073
run across my chest,

10:42.075 --> 10:43.875
and as it's touching me,
I feel almost like

10:43.877 --> 10:45.977
being shocked
by an electric fence.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.345
What'd you do?

10:47.347 --> 10:49.381
I actually had thought about
climbing out of my window.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.383
I couldn't move, so I just
kind of laid there,

10:51.385 --> 10:52.684
and I just
kind of closed my eyes

10:52.686 --> 10:54.552
and just hoped that
it would go away.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.054
All right.
So anything else?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.422
So I went into the basement.

10:57.424 --> 11:01.126
As quick as snapping my fingers,
something had entered me.

11:01.128 --> 11:04.329
The insides of me, it was almost
like they had changed.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.064
My emotional state had changed.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.668
I felt like a sickness had just
kind of embedded inside of me.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.837
I had to get out of the building
as quickly as I possibly could.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.706
I know Kelley mentioned
about an experience she had

11:14.708 --> 11:18.777
where she felt she actually got
physically jumped by a spirit,

11:18.779 --> 11:20.578
and it sounds a lot like
what you're talking about.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.147
You think that's what
happened to you?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.382
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.618
So you're hearing noises
when people shouldn't be here.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.920
You're getting something
crawling into bed with you.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.056
You're getting...sounds like
jumped by a spirit

11:31.058 --> 11:32.357
in the basement,

11:32.359 --> 11:35.360
but yet you don't think
it's dangerous here.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.596
Yeah, I can see why you'd think
that that would be a problem,

11:38.598 --> 11:40.999
and, I, you know, sometimes,
it does worry me.

11:41.001 --> 11:44.102
Are you not taking it
as serious as you should?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.437
That's possible.

11:48.942 --> 11:54.879
The skeleton-face dude, he is
very protective of this area,

11:54.881 --> 11:57.048
so I think that he would

11:57.050 --> 11:59.551
probably get physical
with the living down here

11:59.553 --> 12:02.620
because he doesn't
want them down here.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.989
Over here is really bad.

12:04.991 --> 12:09.961
People would be pushed, hit,
slapped, punched.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.763
I don't know how many people
he's actually had

12:11.765 --> 12:15.333
to physically assault
to get them out of here.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.336
It seems like he does more
of the killing upstairs.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.711
Kelley is here all the time, and
you don't get here that often.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.246
You know, with some of
the stuff she talked about,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.682
it's pretty dangerous.
- Yeah. That's true.

12:30.684 --> 12:33.752
You know, the amount of time
she spends here, that scares me.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.354
I'm concerned about something,
you know, jumping on.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.757
I'm concerned about her
bringing something home.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.559
- Have you had any experiences?
- Yeah.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.062
We were downstairs with a group
of people and just really,

12:44.064 --> 12:46.831
all of a sudden,
it just turned black,

12:46.833 --> 12:48.767
couldn't really even see
the hand in front of your face.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.502
It startled me.

12:50.504 --> 12:51.903
Now you say you were
down there with a group.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.439
- What are you talking about?
- There was an investigation.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.307
All right, so you had
a paranormal investigative group

12:56.309 --> 12:58.543
in the building.
- Yes.

12:58.545 --> 13:01.179
Is that something
you regularly do here?
Yeah.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.715
I gotta warn you,
Amy's not gonna like that.

13:03.717 --> 13:05.517
All right.
So any other experiences?

13:05.519 --> 13:08.419
Well, in this room,
I was here one evening,

13:08.421 --> 13:11.623
and there was this sound
of glasses clanking together,

13:11.625 --> 13:14.893
and a bottle on this back bar
just burst on its own.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.162
I mean, is it possible that
bottle already had a crack in it

13:17.164 --> 13:19.531
and just finally gave way?
- I suppose it's possible.

13:19.533 --> 13:22.000
To me, was hard to explain.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.702
I've learned one thing
from my partner is that

13:24.704 --> 13:26.704
when things get physical
like they are here,

13:26.706 --> 13:28.540
it's only gonna get worse.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.547
Wow. Okay.
There's a lot of residual here.

13:35.549 --> 13:37.615
A lot of residual.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.918
Now this is going back,
and so I'm seeing,

13:39.920 --> 13:44.789
like, people drinking,
partying, having a good time,

13:44.791 --> 13:49.828
and this looks like
a <i> long</i> time ago.

13:49.830 --> 13:53.364
So how might all this
residual affect living people?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.200
Wouldn't be surprised
if the living are

13:55.202 --> 14:00.538
hearing the partying
from way back in the day --

14:00.540 --> 14:03.474
glasses clinging,
chairs being moved,

14:03.476 --> 14:05.510
like, stuff like that.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.346
Or they'll hear bits
of conversation.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.650
Residual energy is funny because
it can cause health problems.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.751
Like?

14:13.753 --> 14:15.887
Having flu symptoms
or cold symptoms.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.255
Like, getting sick often.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.059
I talked to a bunch of people
who spend time

14:21.061 --> 14:22.527
at the Palmer House...

14:22.529 --> 14:25.997
One time I was here,
I heard a loud explosion,

14:25.999 --> 14:27.532
like a bomb went off.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.634
...and all of them
had strange things happen

14:29.636 --> 14:31.302
that they couldn't explain.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.239
I stayed overnight,
third-floor room upstairs,

14:34.241 --> 14:38.009
and I had a big wicker chair
move on its own.

14:38.011 --> 14:41.212
As a cop, I always look for
witnesses whose stories match.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.847
And just about everyone here

14:42.849 --> 14:44.649
talked about seeing
shadow figures.

14:44.651 --> 14:48.219
I can tell you about my most
emotional, scary experience.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.454
One time, in the basement,

14:49.456 --> 14:51.723
I was shoved by
a big black shadow figure.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.691
Can you describe
what it looked like?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.960
An outline, a silhouette
of a man in a suit

14:55.962 --> 14:57.462
with very broad shoulders,

14:57.464 --> 15:01.399
and his head went all the way up
to the top of the doorway.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.268
Okay.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.504
There's just a lot
of people.

15:06.506 --> 15:10.074
Kind of looked like
shadow people, but they're not.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.043
I don't know
what they're doing here.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.611
I don't know why.

15:13.613 --> 15:17.215
I would say, like, five or six.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.517
It seems that they're men.

15:19.519 --> 15:27.425
They seem confused,
and they seem a little crazy.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.127
How would the living
be affected by them?

15:29.129 --> 15:34.632
I think being exposed to them
would make a living person angry

15:34.634 --> 15:37.068
and kind of nuts.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.750
Look, this is a small town,
and the Palmer House

15:52.752 --> 15:55.353
is probably the most important
local landmark.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.956
So all the historian types
know all about it.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.291
But one woman
just called me back and says

16:00.293 --> 16:03.661
the man who owned the property
before it became this hotel

16:03.663 --> 16:05.964
has a story I'm definitely
gonna wanna know about.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.036
So, Jill, thanks
for reaching out to me.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.205
I appreciate that.
Who was this guy?

16:14.207 --> 16:17.041
Yeah, that would have been
Cassius Sprigg.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.410
He was one of
the early pioneers in town.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.180
Okay. So what was so interesting
about this guy?

16:22.182 --> 16:24.882
He was a soldier in one of
the bloodiest battles

16:24.884 --> 16:26.818
between settlers
and Native Americans.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.820
Okay. So now tell me about
this battle.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.889
He was just, like, 15 years old
when he fought in the battle

16:31.891 --> 16:33.558
that become known
as the Battle of Ridgely.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.593
It's about 90 miles south
of here.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.395
- And this kid was only 15?
- Yes, he was.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.230
That was not uncommon
for that time.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.666
Okay. So how does this
bloody battle end?

16:41.668 --> 16:43.968
Well, on December 26, 1862,

16:43.970 --> 16:47.071
38 Native Americans
were hung.

16:47.073 --> 16:51.109
To this day, it's the largest
mass execution in history.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.644
Jeez.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.951
I'm seeing a woman,
and she is hanging herself.

17:03.156 --> 17:07.791
The skeleton-face guy,
he is breaking her neck.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.993
He's directly involved.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.063
He's killing people,

17:12.065 --> 17:15.833
actually killing them.

17:15.835 --> 17:19.170
This land is very, very bad.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.705
It draws the dead in.

17:21.708 --> 17:26.210
The dead can't rest,
so it's like a gathering place.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.579
It breeds psychopaths.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.316
Okay.
So now the war's over.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.218
When does Cassius get ahold
of my client's property?

17:34.220 --> 17:36.087
He would have bought it
in 1898.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.522
- Okay.
- It was a hotel

17:37.524 --> 17:40.691
called the Sauk Centre House
at the time.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.393
It was not
a great investment.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.129
- Why?
- On June 27, 1900,

17:45.131 --> 17:46.831
it burned completely
to the ground.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.434
All right.
This poor guy had the property
2 years and lost everything.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.636
Yes. Now, there have been
several fires

17:51.638 --> 17:52.970
on that property
over the years.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.439
You might want
to look into that.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.207
That's interesting.
Okay. I will.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.443
Okay. Any idea what started
this fire?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.611
It started in the kitchen,
they believe.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.846
- Anybody die?
- No.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.548
There were 30 guests
in the hotel at the time.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.949
There were no fatalities.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.184
Okay, but it's destroyed
totally.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.386
- Completely.
- What happens next?

18:08.388 --> 18:10.488
He collected
the insurance money

18:10.490 --> 18:13.157
and then sold it
to the family, the Palmers.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.094
Who built the hotel
that's there today.
Correct.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.795
Okay. So what happens to him
after he sells the property

18:17.797 --> 18:18.963
to the Palmers?

18:18.965 --> 18:20.932
Well, his fortune seemed
to change after that.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.700
He went into banking.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.936
By the end of his life,
he owned 12 banks.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.304
Okay.
So he it turns out this fire

18:26.306 --> 18:28.072
might have been
a good thing for him.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.208
You can look at it that way.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.445
I'm trying to figure out

18:34.447 --> 18:38.282
who this skeleton-face guy was
when he was alive.

18:38.284 --> 18:42.520
He had a lot of money,
something with a bank.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.890
I'm seeing a bank had
a direct connection here.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.625
Do you know when this was?

18:47.627 --> 18:51.028
Around 1890.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.997
He's protecting something.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.433
I know that this is part
of his secret.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.940
He admits to killing people
when he was alive.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.343
He let that slip out.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.645
He's pissed.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.784
Jill said there were
other fires on the property,

19:13.786 --> 19:15.486
and it turns out she's right.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.889
I'm headed over to meet with
the city's former fire chief,

19:17.891 --> 19:19.390
who dug through
the records for me

19:19.392 --> 19:22.026
and found four major fires
on the land.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.333
Now, John, you mentioned
on the phone

19:29.335 --> 19:30.801
that there were
four major fires

19:30.803 --> 19:32.170
at the property
I'm investigating.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.572
Now I know one happened
in 1900.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.774
I know there's three more.
Let's start with the first one.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.777
Okay. It was back
in September of 1873.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.045
The fire was in the barn.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.648
They believe it had
caught on fire

19:43.650 --> 19:46.717
from a cigar discarded
into a bale of hay.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.719
All right.
Was anybody injured or killed?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.588
No injured or nobody killed.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.791
All right, John.
So what about the second fire?

19:53.793 --> 19:57.228
February of 1885,
there was a large fire.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.865
I'm not sure where or how
it started.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.366
One oddity to it is that

20:02.368 --> 20:05.303
the current owner of
that building at that time

20:05.305 --> 20:07.171
was the Sauk Centre
Fire Chief.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.506
Jeez. Okay.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.108
So now we got three fires
on my client's property.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.443
What about the fourth one?

20:12.445 --> 20:17.381
July 31, 1905. It happened
at the Palmer House.

20:17.383 --> 20:21.052
And as you can see, it looks
pretty much as it does today.

20:21.054 --> 20:24.789
And it was quite big news
at the time.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.491
According to this, boarders
jumped from the windows?

20:27.493 --> 20:30.561
There was eight employees,
I believe, on the second floor

20:30.563 --> 20:33.631
that were trapped which had
to jump out of the building,

20:33.633 --> 20:36.734
onto a canopy.
- Wow.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.103
Yeah, desperate times,
desperate measures.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.372
You know, over a 30-year-period,
you got four major fires,

20:41.374 --> 20:44.208
two really bad ones.
- Yes.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.477
And I'm just shocked that
nobody got injured or killed.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.979
It's amazing.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.995
Getting, like, a lot of smoke.

21:03.997 --> 21:06.797
Yeah, there's a lot of smoke
up here.

21:06.799 --> 21:10.301
I'm seeing a woman,
and she can't get out.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.370
I don't know what this is.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.138
She is panicked.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.707
She feels very dizzy,
lightheaded.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.645
She can't breathe.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.052
I- I don't feel good.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.587
This is bad.

21:43.503 --> 21:46.170
So far, I've got
employees and guests

21:46.172 --> 21:47.905
being tormented
by bizarre activity

21:47.907 --> 21:52.143
on a property devastated
by four mysterious fires.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.578
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.348
Searching through old records,
I find a local police officer

21:57.350 --> 21:59.517
named Jason Rosenburger.

21:59.519 --> 22:02.019
Turns out, Jason was found dead
right down the street

22:02.021 --> 22:04.021
from the Palmer House.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.190
So I have a local reporter

22:06.192 --> 22:07.892
looking into
this cop's death for me.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.328
He did some digging and said
not only did he figure out

22:10.330 --> 22:11.696
what happened to this guy,

22:11.698 --> 22:14.198
but he found another death
associated with the Palmer House

22:14.200 --> 22:15.800
that may help me out.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.075
Mark, this article I came across
where the cop wound up dead,

22:24.077 --> 22:26.243
what were you able
to find out?

22:26.245 --> 22:28.846
On April 17, 1929,

22:28.848 --> 22:31.649
Jason Rosenburger was
a policeman,

22:31.651 --> 22:35.753
also night patrol,
was found dead at City Hall.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.154
How far is this
from the Palmer House?

22:37.156 --> 22:39.190
Approximately 500 feet.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.158
In fact, the last person
to see him alive

22:41.160 --> 22:43.627
was the night clerk
at the Palmer House.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.196
I know this guy got shot,

22:45.198 --> 22:46.764
so do we know
where the bullet entered?

22:46.766 --> 22:49.266
Next to his nose,
just right underneath the eye.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.935
So I'm assuming
this is a homicide.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.002
Not necessarily.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.804
The coroner's jury came back

22:53.806 --> 22:56.407
and said it was accidental
discharge of the firearm.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.942
All right.
So if it's accidental,

22:57.944 --> 23:00.044
I guess a round
from his firearm was missing,

23:00.046 --> 23:01.579
and that's what
he shot himself with.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.248
Well, that's where it gets
interesting, because the round

23:04.250 --> 23:07.451
that they found
did not match his gun.

23:07.453 --> 23:10.654
Plus, his gun was
still fully loaded.

23:10.656 --> 23:13.924
So how the hell is this
an accidental shooting?

23:13.926 --> 23:15.192
That, I don't know.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.495
To me, it's a homicide.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.629
I mean, it sounds almost like

23:18.631 --> 23:21.031
there's something being
covered up.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.635
Somebody lost their left eye.

23:24.637 --> 23:28.072
It's a male.

23:28.074 --> 23:31.809
This male is getting shot,
definitely a shooting.

23:31.811 --> 23:35.012
The guy in there
got shot in the eye.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.481
I'm not being able
to see out of it.

23:37.483 --> 23:40.084
He could absolutely be
in denial.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.919
So, Mark, you mentioned
on the phone

23:41.921 --> 23:43.888
there was another death
that might help my case.
Yes.

23:43.890 --> 23:47.458
Back in 1870, there was
a freed slave named Mose

23:47.460 --> 23:49.427
that lived and worked
at the property

23:49.429 --> 23:50.628
you're investigating.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.863
It was called the Barnum Hotel
at that time.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.432
So do we know anything
about this guy Mose?

23:54.434 --> 23:57.001
Well, it was known that
he was terrified of ghosts.

23:57.003 --> 24:00.604
And also, he had experienced
some paranormal activity

24:00.606 --> 24:02.173
at the Barnum Hotel.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.908
Well, this is something
new I've never come across.

24:03.910 --> 24:07.812
So back in 1870, somebody
was having experiences

24:07.814 --> 24:10.080
on the property
I'm investigating now.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.016
- Correct.
- How did he die?

24:12.018 --> 24:15.085
A couple of local boys
wanted to pull a prank on him,

24:15.087 --> 24:16.420
dress up as ghosts.

24:16.422 --> 24:19.723
They hid in the hotel,
and everywhere he turned,

24:19.725 --> 24:21.725
he'd run into a ghost,
and he got so scared

24:21.727 --> 24:23.527
he just ran off into
the woods,

24:23.529 --> 24:25.463
and he ended up spending
the night out there.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.032
It was a cold and rainy night.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.201
Right. So did this guy
die out in the woods?

24:30.203 --> 24:31.735
No. They found him
the next morning,

24:31.737 --> 24:34.805
and he was horribly sick,
brought him back to the hotel,

24:34.807 --> 24:37.441
where he later died
on your client's property.

24:43.549 --> 24:46.283
I saw several disturbing
things during my walk,

24:46.285 --> 24:48.786
but two stood out.

24:48.788 --> 24:52.690
First, the shadows figures
who hang out upstairs.

24:52.692 --> 24:53.924
There was one crawling
on the ceiling.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.793
There was one
crawling up the wall,

24:55.795 --> 25:00.531
and then others that were
just really fragmented.

25:00.533 --> 25:05.402
One looked like he was dripping,
like, chunks of tar.

25:05.404 --> 25:08.072
Next, I described
the skeleton-face man

25:08.074 --> 25:11.008
attacking the living.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.277
There was this dead guy,

25:13.279 --> 25:16.514
and he was pretty tall,
really thin,

25:16.516 --> 25:19.884
and he was punching
a living person.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.325
Amy, is this what
you saw?

25:28.327 --> 25:30.227
Yes, that's what I saw.

25:47.647 --> 25:51.148
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

25:51.150 --> 25:53.384
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

25:53.386 --> 25:56.020
and our clients
for the first time.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.421
Well, Amy, I want you
to meet Kelley.

25:57.423 --> 26:00.357
She owns the hotel and called us
in because activity is bad

26:00.359 --> 26:01.825
and it's getting worse.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.160
I got to be up front
with something.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.796
No matter what you say tonight,
she ain't leaving.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.000
Wyatt's been living here
for about 7 months,

26:10.002 --> 26:12.202
and he's already been through
a hell of a lot,

26:12.204 --> 26:13.437
and I don't think
it's going to take a lot

26:13.439 --> 26:15.105
to convince him to move.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.840
But they're hoping
you can figure out a way

26:16.842 --> 26:19.410
to make this place safe.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.245
So now that
Amy has met you guys,

26:21.247 --> 26:23.380
I'm going to ask her
to describe her walk for us.

26:27.219 --> 26:30.955
I got that this was
a gathering spot
for the dead,

26:30.957 --> 26:33.891
and it has been for
a very, very long time,

26:33.893 --> 26:35.893
and because of that,

26:35.895 --> 26:38.996
there is
this <i> huge</i> collection

26:38.998 --> 26:43.334
of residual information.

26:43.336 --> 26:46.403
I think that living would
maybe hear partying going on.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.739
You'd hear, like, glasses
clinking, chairs moving,

26:48.741 --> 26:50.274
people walking around.

26:50.276 --> 26:54.645
If you're consistently exposed
to this kind of energy,

26:54.647 --> 26:56.914
it can make somebody sick.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.215
Well, it's funny.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.317
You hit on some of
the experiences they're having.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.852
Now, Wyatt,
you mentioned it sounded like

27:01.854 --> 27:03.287
somebody dropped a...

27:03.289 --> 27:05.556
30-pound weight above me,
and it's during a time

27:05.558 --> 27:08.492
when I know
there's nobody in the hotel.

27:08.494 --> 27:11.762
- Kelley, you've heard footsteps.
- That's very common.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.698
I've had other guests
talk about that as well.

27:14.700 --> 27:19.203
Now, Kelley, and you as well,
Wyatt, told me about being sick.

27:19.205 --> 27:24.541
There are some days that
it's just unexplainable fatigue,

27:24.543 --> 27:26.076
the headache, nausea...

27:26.078 --> 27:28.412
...feeling a little off-balance
or dizzy.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.514
I get the exact same
kind of feeling.

27:31.651 --> 27:34.318
Sick to my stomach,
a little woozy.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.221
Amy, you said you got a lot
of residual information.

27:37.223 --> 27:41.792
Well, this building we're
sitting in was built in 1901.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.395
I have a photo right around
when it was built.

27:44.397 --> 27:48.165
There's been a hotel on this
property since at least 1867.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.501
You can imagine, there's been
a lot of people over the years

27:50.503 --> 27:52.236
that have come through here.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.637
That totally makes sense

27:53.639 --> 27:56.073
with all the residual energy
that's here.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.711
Okay, so what else?

28:00.713 --> 28:02.146
So I'm on the third floor.

28:02.148 --> 28:06.650
I'm literally tasting smoke
in my mouth and coughing.

28:06.652 --> 28:09.687
Then I'm feeling this woman,
but she was all alone

28:09.689 --> 28:11.922
and she was freaking out,
so she was panicking, too,

28:11.924 --> 28:12.956
which was making it worse

28:12.958 --> 28:14.825
because she was
breathing more in.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.226
There's something
you should know about, Amy,

28:16.228 --> 28:17.561
about this place.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.730
There were
four major fires here.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.165
Holy...

28:21.167 --> 28:23.200
First fire happened in 1873

28:23.202 --> 28:26.170
when this hotel was known
as the Sauk Centre House.

28:26.172 --> 28:29.506
Here's a photo of
the original hotel.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.442
Then in February of 1885,

28:31.444 --> 28:33.777
the Sauk Centre Hotel
partially burned down.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.512
Records are kind of thin
on that fire,

28:35.514 --> 28:38.248
so we don't know what happened,
but nobody was hurt.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.850
The next fire was in 1900,

28:39.852 --> 28:41.285
and this one started
in the kitchen.

28:41.287 --> 28:44.655
Once again, no casualties,
but the building was destroyed.

28:44.657 --> 28:46.824
After that fire,
this hotel was built.

28:46.826 --> 28:50.828
Now, the final fire happened
in July of 1905

28:50.830 --> 28:52.429
at about 2:45 a.m.,

28:52.431 --> 28:53.797
and that was the scariest one.

28:53.799 --> 28:57.034
They had 45 employees and guests
in the hotel at the time.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.670
They were forced to evacuate,
but eight of those people

28:59.672 --> 29:02.106
were trapped upstairs
on the second floor.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.774
They had to jump out
of the window...

29:03.776 --> 29:06.810
...onto the old canvas tarps
to escape.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.680
I actually have an article
on that fire.

29:09.682 --> 29:11.582
Now, the building
was badly damaged.

29:11.584 --> 29:14.485
But amazingly enough, again,
there was no casualties.

29:14.487 --> 29:17.254
- That's a lot of fires.
- I did not know that.

29:19.391 --> 29:22.960
So I'm in the dining room,
and now I'm getting this guy.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.895
And he's shot
in one of his eyes,

29:24.897 --> 29:26.997
'cause I couldn't see
out of the eye.

29:26.999 --> 29:32.336
He is a dead person,
but he's in denial.

29:32.338 --> 29:36.640
I did come across one individual
that was shot in the eye,

29:36.642 --> 29:38.675
and his name was
Jason Rosenburger.

29:38.677 --> 29:42.613
Yeah, he was a Sauk Centre
policeman and a night watchman.
Wow.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.682
April 17, 1929, his body
was found in the old City Hall,

29:45.684 --> 29:47.184
less than 500 feet from here.

29:47.186 --> 29:50.687
In fact, the Palmer House Hotel
was on Rosenburger's beat,

29:50.689 --> 29:52.389
and the night that he died,

29:52.391 --> 29:54.825
this was the last location
he was seen alive.

29:54.827 --> 29:57.461
He had been shot in the face,
and the bullet entered

29:57.463 --> 29:59.029
just underneath his eye.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.932
Now the coroner's jury decided
it was an accidental death.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.500
I don't buy it.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.069
The bullet on the scene didn't
match the bullets in his gun.

30:06.071 --> 30:09.573
Not only that, no round
was discharged from his firearm.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.208
I'm convinced it was a homicide.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.342
I...Yeah.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.044
- You agree?
- Absolutely.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.679
Whatever happened,
happened so quick.

30:15.681 --> 30:20.317
He had no knowledge because he's
in complete denial of his death.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.352
I- I didn't know any of this,

30:22.354 --> 30:25.889
and everything is
so much more real.

30:30.996 --> 30:34.031
So another thing that I saw --
now we're going back up

30:34.033 --> 30:35.499
to the third floor,

30:35.501 --> 30:39.203
and I see about
four to six shadow beings,

30:39.205 --> 30:42.472
and I knew
pretty damn quickly

30:42.474 --> 30:45.876
that they were
actually dead men,

30:45.878 --> 30:47.311
and the thing is,
is that these are

30:47.313 --> 30:49.479
severely mentally ill people.

30:49.481 --> 30:53.951
I think the biggest problem
with this for the living

30:53.953 --> 30:58.121
is that, when you're exposed
to that kind of energy,

30:58.123 --> 31:02.759
you're going to start having
behavioral changes yourself --

31:02.761 --> 31:07.898
anger, acting kind of off
would begin to happen.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.499
I've noticed that myself.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.168
In yourself?
Even in myself.

31:11.170 --> 31:15.072
What kind of thoughts
or emotions were you having?

31:15.074 --> 31:18.275
A lot of anxiety, panicky,
a lot of nervousness

31:18.277 --> 31:20.344
that came out of nowhere.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.980
There's days where
all of the employees,

31:22.982 --> 31:25.916
there can just be
very erratic,

31:25.918 --> 31:28.085
unreasonable behavior,
actually.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.587
- Really?
- You got a hotel here.

31:30.589 --> 31:31.922
Why don't you
just sell it, right?

31:31.924 --> 31:35.292
But I want you to tell Amy
how important this is.

31:35.294 --> 31:38.729
I have come to take it
very personal and very seriously

31:38.731 --> 31:40.230
that this is my purpose,

31:40.232 --> 31:45.002
and my life is to be
the steward for it now.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.370
And this is why, I told you
at the beginning,

31:46.372 --> 31:47.838
she's not giving up.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.339
She's not moving.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.941
The crazy people
that look like shadows,

31:50.943 --> 31:53.443
now would the living see that?

31:53.445 --> 31:55.379
Or is that something
only you saw?

31:55.381 --> 31:59.549
I do think that the living would
occasionally see shadow figures,

31:59.551 --> 32:03.186
and I had a sketch done
of specifically what I saw.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.533
Here you go, guys.

32:22.675 --> 32:25.842
I gotta say that that's exactly
kind of how it feels.

32:25.844 --> 32:28.745
It just feels like
I'm falling apart.

32:28.747 --> 32:33.450
Just about everyone I talked
to here has seen shadow figures.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.119
Other guests have shared
with me...
Right.

32:36.121 --> 32:37.321
...lots of
different things...
Yeah.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.089
...that are fairly extreme.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.924
What did you consider
extreme?

32:40.926 --> 32:42.659
On the ceiling, for example.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.561
- Yeah.
- Up the wall.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.896
That would be terrifying.

32:45.898 --> 32:48.265
Yeah.
I would think so, yeah.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.334
Kelley here has seen
specific shadow figures

32:50.336 --> 32:51.902
down here in this basement.

32:51.904 --> 32:53.070
He is so big.

32:53.072 --> 32:57.374
His mass is so wide
and he's so tall.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.610
- Is that what she's seeing?
- No. Mnh-mnh, no.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.113
- That's somebody else.
- Ooh.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.015
- That's not good news.
- Yeah.

33:07.753 --> 33:11.121
So one of the dead people
that I encountered

33:11.123 --> 33:15.058
was a dead woman
who was murdered.

33:15.060 --> 33:18.161
She was murdered by the guy
that she was with,

33:18.163 --> 33:21.498
and he's here,
and he's very active here,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.200
but I'll get to him
in a second.

33:23.202 --> 33:26.703
The woman is most active
in the kitchen.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.139
She can get physical
with the living,

33:29.141 --> 33:32.175
and I did see her pushing
a female

33:32.177 --> 33:33.944
out one of the doors
out there.

33:33.946 --> 33:35.579
Like, just pushing her out.

33:35.581 --> 33:36.780
Now, Kelley,
you weren't pushed,

33:36.782 --> 33:38.615
but you had something
thrown at you.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.851
There was a mixing bowl.

33:40.853 --> 33:44.121
It flew off of the shelf
it was on,

33:44.123 --> 33:46.223
about 10 feet
through the air.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.825
So she's throwing...

33:48.827 --> 33:50.894
Now how about the guy
that killed her?

33:50.896 --> 33:54.164
Yes. I'm gonna refer to him
as "skeleton face."

33:54.166 --> 33:56.633
This is the male
who killed this female.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.503
He is definitely
the biggest threat.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.438
He's very, very powerful,

34:01.440 --> 34:04.307
very dangerous,
and <i> very</i> secretive.

34:04.309 --> 34:08.344
There are a few things that
I was able to get out of him.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.614
He was white, lots of money.

34:10.616 --> 34:14.217
I got that the 1890s were
very important to him,

34:14.219 --> 34:16.753
absolute connection
to this location.

34:16.755 --> 34:20.623
He made it very clear to me
that he did a lot of bad things

34:20.626 --> 34:21.792
when he was alive,

34:21.793 --> 34:25.161
and that included
killing several people.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.864
You know, it's not a lot
to go on, but some of the stuff

34:27.866 --> 34:29.099
you were talking about
reminds me

34:29.101 --> 34:31.134
of one of the past owners
of this place.

34:31.136 --> 34:32.835
His name was Cassius Sprigg.

34:32.838 --> 34:35.172
You mentioned the 1890s
were important to him.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.274
Now, he bought
this property in 1898.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.708
Now, the guy you saw killed
people when he was alive.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.446
Well, Cassius fought
in the Dakota-Indian Wars.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.014
Now, we have no idea
how many people Cassius killed,

34:45.016 --> 34:46.917
but we do know
that the war ended

34:46.918 --> 34:49.119
with the execution
of 38 people,

34:49.121 --> 34:51.221
and he was part of all this.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.956
To this day, it's the largest
mass execution

34:52.958 --> 34:54.291
in American history.

34:54.293 --> 34:57.260
Now, Sprigg only owned
this hotel for a few years.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.129
After he got out of
the hotel business, though,

34:59.131 --> 35:03.600
he got into banking
and made a small fortune.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.436
I've got a photo of him.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.339
Any chances this is who you saw?

35:09.341 --> 35:11.041
- Any idea?
- I don't think so

35:11.043 --> 35:13.710
'cause he made it seem
like the killings

35:13.712 --> 35:19.549
he did were not, like,
public knowledge.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.852
Now you said you were concerned
about the skeleton-face guy.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.019
Why is that?

35:23.021 --> 35:26.656
This guy is capable
of mimicking voices,

35:26.658 --> 35:28.291
mimicking people.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.726
So like,
a friend, coworker,

35:29.728 --> 35:31.228
when you think
they're saying something

35:31.230 --> 35:33.830
and there's nobody there.

35:33.832 --> 35:36.967
That's a common occurrence
for myself and other employees,

35:36.969 --> 35:40.103
and you keep trying
to go find it, thinking,

35:40.105 --> 35:42.139
"Maybe somebody came back
into the building,"

35:42.141 --> 35:44.908
and then that's
eventually realized

35:44.910 --> 35:46.610
that you're
in the building alone.

35:46.612 --> 35:50.413
And what's probably the most
frightening for living people

35:50.415 --> 35:53.650
is that he does know
how to jump people.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.319
He was trying to do it to me
throughout my walk,

35:56.321 --> 35:58.021
and he was
extremely aggressive

35:58.023 --> 36:00.290
when I got down into
the basement.

36:00.292 --> 36:04.027
My god.

36:04.029 --> 36:06.863
These are two people that feel
like they've been jumped.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.832
I don't have a lot of memory
when it happened to me,

36:08.834 --> 36:11.801
I just knew it wasn't me.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.203
Couldn't collect my thoughts.

36:13.205 --> 36:16.239
Like, I felt like this outer
shell of me was doing something,

36:16.241 --> 36:18.875
and the inside was
looking around going,

36:18.877 --> 36:20.977
"What is going on?"

36:20.979 --> 36:23.380
Something similar
happened to Wyatt.

36:23.382 --> 36:26.016
I was down here in the basement
and was just, like,

36:26.018 --> 36:27.517
a snap of my fingers,

36:27.519 --> 36:30.287
and I felt overcome
and overwhelmed.

36:30.289 --> 36:34.524
He will do anything he can
to instill fear

36:34.526 --> 36:36.560
and get the living
out of here,

36:36.562 --> 36:39.829
and that can become
physical or be physical --

36:39.831 --> 36:42.766
slapping, pushing, punching.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.769
I saw him punching a male
in the back,

36:45.771 --> 36:48.038
and I did have a sketch done.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.441
This should be interesting.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.119
Ooh.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.630
That's some picture, ain't it?

37:13.632 --> 37:16.433
I don't know even know
what to say to that.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.868
My god.

37:18.870 --> 37:22.439
What's this speck behind it?
What's this going on?

37:22.441 --> 37:23.607
This is a friend of his,

37:23.609 --> 37:25.508
and they're killing
this guy here.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.310
He didn't want me
to see that.

37:30.182 --> 37:32.716
He's gotta go.

37:32.718 --> 37:35.085
What the hell does this guy
want from these guys?

37:35.087 --> 37:37.187
Basically, he wants
to kill living people.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.670
Kelley, you made it
very clear

37:53.672 --> 37:55.639
that leaving here
is not an option for you.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.274
But after what
we've heard tonight,

37:57.276 --> 38:00.744
it's crystal clear that
it's not safe here for you,

38:00.746 --> 38:02.512
your employees or the guests.

38:02.514 --> 38:05.448
Now we're going to find out if
there's any way to change that.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.584
For that answer, I'm going to
turn it over to Amy.

38:11.757 --> 38:14.424
I have something to say
really quickly.

38:14.426 --> 38:16.159
A few days after my walk,

38:16.161 --> 38:19.496
I see that you're doing
an event here --

38:19.498 --> 38:21.931
a ghost tour.
- Yeah.

38:25.203 --> 38:26.636
How long have you been
doing that?

38:26.638 --> 38:29.072
Probably for about
4 or 5 years now.

38:29.074 --> 38:32.242
You've noticed an increase
in activity?

38:32.244 --> 38:36.346
I would say that's fair.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.381
When you're stirring up
this kind of activity,

38:38.383 --> 38:41.685
...gonna go wrong.

38:41.687 --> 38:42.852
I gotta ask you.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.554
When we talked,
you never really mentioned

38:44.556 --> 38:46.589
about this whole
ghost-hunting thing.

38:46.591 --> 38:51.261
I never thought of that as
being a contributing factor.

38:51.263 --> 38:55.298
A big reason of why
I do what I do is the dead.

38:55.300 --> 39:00.303
These were people,
and they still are people.

39:00.305 --> 39:05.208
It's easy, I think,
for the living, um,

39:05.210 --> 39:11.114
to have a disassociation
with that concept.

39:11.116 --> 39:14.684
My question is,
what do you want to do?

39:14.686 --> 39:18.488
And do you want
the dead here or not?

39:23.795 --> 39:27.997
If they need moving on,
I'm in complete support of that.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.600
All right. So how do they
get rid of 'em?

39:30.602 --> 39:33.169
You do have to find
a male medium

39:33.171 --> 39:37.640
who is also
a chaos magician.

39:37.642 --> 39:42.245
He is going to basically
collect

39:42.247 --> 39:44.881
the dead skeleton guy

39:44.883 --> 39:48.852
and remove him
from the location altogether.

39:48.854 --> 39:52.222
The other thing that does
is that it literally

39:52.224 --> 39:56.192
will clear the basement
of not only him but also

39:56.194 --> 40:01.731
all the residual information
and energy down here.

40:01.733 --> 40:08.138
So, like, this basement?
Nothing. Nothing going on.

40:08.140 --> 40:10.640
So she won't see the shadows
down here, won't get jumped.

40:10.642 --> 40:13.009
Yeah, that's right.

40:13.011 --> 40:16.780
On another day, the same medium
could come back and remove

40:16.782 --> 40:21.084
all of the shadow people
and the pissy lady.

40:21.086 --> 40:26.055
Unfortunately, the cop, nothing,
at this point, can be done.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.925
Now, if you want to keep
doing ghost tours,

40:28.927 --> 40:31.494
you can keep the residual,

40:31.496 --> 40:34.564
and there is
a <i> plethora</i> of it.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.366
So, Kelley,
when we first talked,

40:36.368 --> 40:39.269
you were just about ready
to break down.

40:39.271 --> 40:43.139
Now it looks like you get to
not only keep your place

40:43.141 --> 40:46.476
but find out a way
to make it safe

40:46.478 --> 40:49.012
and still have it
as an attraction for people

40:49.014 --> 40:51.881
that are into the ghost hunting.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.417
That would absolutely
be ideal.

40:54.419 --> 40:57.754
Now the ultimate question --
Are you gonna do what she says?

40:57.756 --> 41:00.123
Yes, I absolutely will.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.124
So, Wyatt, what about you?

41:01.126 --> 41:02.592
Would you be willing
to help out?

41:02.594 --> 41:05.128
Yeah, I'm here for her.

41:05.130 --> 41:12.402
I am so immensely pleased
and relieved and grateful.

41:12.404 --> 41:16.372
I feel very optimistic
about everything.

41:16.374 --> 41:17.874
It won't be easy

41:17.876 --> 41:19.909
removing the dangerous dead
inside this hotel.

41:19.911 --> 41:22.679
But if Kelley contacts
the medium, who is also

41:22.681 --> 41:25.148
a chaos magician,
to banish the dead,

41:25.150 --> 41:27.517
her guests and employees
will be safe,

41:27.519 --> 41:30.587
and she can keep running
the hotel she loves so much.
