WEBVTT

00:09.276 --> 00:12.911
ANDY: So I'm going through
my woodpiles here.

00:12.913 --> 00:16.148
I'm trying to find
some nice lumber.

00:16.150 --> 00:19.284
I've decided I'm gonna build
myself an iceboat,

00:19.286 --> 00:23.956
so I can go sailing
out on the frozen lake.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.357
We haven't gotten much snow.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.759
What you see right here,

00:26.761 --> 00:30.429
that's the extent of all
of our snow so far this fall.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.432
It's been a crazy year.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.769
I'm having a really hard time
trying to get some exercise,

00:36.771 --> 00:39.271
get some miles on my dogs.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.573
It's not easy maintaining
a kennel of dogs,

00:41.575 --> 00:44.076
but it's also your lifeline,

00:44.078 --> 00:47.813
and it's the thing that provides
me with transportation and food

00:47.815 --> 00:50.883
and access to hundreds of miles
of country

00:50.885 --> 00:55.087
that I can collect wood in,
I can go trapping in.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.789
And so I'm gonna build
an iceboat.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.891
I always wanted to have
a little iceboat

00:58.893 --> 01:01.760
so I could go sailing
out on this lake.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.362
I'm pretty landlocked in.

01:03.364 --> 01:07.266
The Yukon River's flowing ice
goes all the way around me.

01:07.268 --> 01:10.803
So I've basically got
four miles of trail I can run.

01:10.805 --> 01:15.040
Unfortunately, the four miles
of trail, there's no snow on it.

01:15.042 --> 01:18.010
Getting out with dogs,
mushing nearly impossible.

01:18.012 --> 01:19.578
Very dangerous to do.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.180
Nothing to cushion your fall

01:21.182 --> 01:23.549
if you take a bad spill
on the sled.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.651
Something happens to me
out here, I'm on my own.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.987
Nobody's gonna come looking
for me for a month or two.

01:28.989 --> 01:55.814
¶ ¶

01:55.816 --> 01:57.683
Never built an iceboat before.

01:57.685 --> 02:02.387
I've built a kayak,
I've built a wooden boat.

02:02.389 --> 02:05.090
Lots of houses
and things like that,

02:05.092 --> 02:07.359
but I've never built an iceboat.

02:07.361 --> 02:11.864
¶ ¶

02:11.866 --> 02:13.765
I'm just gonna get
a whole bunch of lumber

02:13.767 --> 02:16.435
that looks fairly good,
get it into my shop,

02:16.437 --> 02:17.803
and then I'm gonna
just start trying

02:17.805 --> 02:20.539
to do some assembly here.

02:22.776 --> 02:26.778
¶ ¶

02:26.780 --> 02:27.913
The most important board

02:27.915 --> 02:30.249
is gonna be this crosspiece
right here.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.718
It's eight foot long
from there to there.

02:32.720 --> 02:36.522
With all my weight right back
in here in the center,

02:36.524 --> 02:39.258
so I have to make sure I have
a really high quality board

02:39.260 --> 02:40.659
for that one board.

02:40.661 --> 02:44.429
If that fails, then the whole
project just goes to crap.

02:44.431 --> 02:47.099
So I'm gonna go ahead
and cut that one first.

02:47.101 --> 02:50.769
[saw whirring]

02:50.771 --> 02:52.871
Hey, there's my eight-footer.

02:52.873 --> 03:02.314
¶ ¶

03:02.316 --> 03:06.318
I'm making the runners right now
for the three skis.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.321
They're made out of
stainless steel angle iron.

03:09.323 --> 03:13.592
[grinder whirring]

03:13.594 --> 03:20.599
¶ ¶

03:20.601 --> 03:23.669
Ford Lake is about a mile long,
about a half-mile wide.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.438
It's a fairly good-sized lake.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.907
It blows really hard there
all the time.

03:28.909 --> 03:33.545
That's what kind of got me the
idea of building this iceboat.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.214
What research I've learned
about these iceboats

03:36.216 --> 03:39.585
is they can go five to seven
times the speed of the wind,

03:39.587 --> 03:41.153
so if I get
a 10-mile-an-hour wind,

03:41.155 --> 03:45.190
I could potentially go
60, 70 miles an hour.

03:45.192 --> 03:48.460
¶ ¶

03:51.265 --> 03:52.931
I'm making pretty good progress.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.367
I need to get this runner
in place.

03:55.369 --> 03:59.805
I mean, if this thing's going
40 or 50 miles an hour,

03:59.807 --> 04:03.208
there's a lot of stress
on these skis.

04:03.210 --> 04:06.511
So that's feeling
pretty tight that way.

04:06.513 --> 04:09.281
Snug this up nice and tight.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.250
You got skis on.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.753
Okay.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.522
I think that'll be a good start
for tonight.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.525
¶ ¶

04:20.527 --> 04:23.562
SUE: These kinds of temperatures
are nothing to fool with.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.898
It bites, it hurts,
it snaps like a frickin' wolf.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.334
Ay, ay, ay!
The weather's coming at me.

04:32.573 --> 04:42.914
¶ ¶

04:42.916 --> 04:44.349
Alright.

04:44.351 --> 04:48.220
I've still got some daylight,
although it's getting less,

04:48.222 --> 04:51.790
so it is time to get out
into the shop, get the Bobcat,

04:51.792 --> 04:54.426
if it will start
in these temperatures,

04:54.428 --> 04:57.396
crank it over, grab the drag,

04:57.398 --> 04:59.865
and see what's
the longest stretch

04:59.867 --> 05:03.568
with the least amount of issues
for a plane to land in the dark,

05:03.570 --> 05:09.408
with the flare pots in an urgent
and non-urgent situation.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.077
Kavik is now
a designated airport.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.712
What does that mean?

05:13.714 --> 05:16.348
Nighttime landings year round.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.517
If search and rescue
says we're coming in,

05:18.519 --> 05:21.353
I have to be ready for it.

05:21.355 --> 05:24.556
I am just on the cusp
of being 24-hour darkness.

05:24.558 --> 05:28.026
That means planes are gonna take
off and land in the darkness.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.262
For people to land here
safely in the dark,

05:30.264 --> 05:34.332
I need to be able to light
a section of the runway up.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.767
I have things called flare pots.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.769
It's sort of like
a teapot with a lid.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.004
Once I light it,

05:39.006 --> 05:42.040
you've got 8 to 10 hours
of this orange flame.

05:42.042 --> 05:47.279
You can see a yellow flickering
light from 50 miles away.

05:47.281 --> 05:48.980
As a designated runway,

05:48.982 --> 05:51.783
I have to get this system
up and running

05:51.785 --> 05:53.652
so that when you have
an emergency

05:53.654 --> 05:55.287
and your plane's
dropping out on you,

05:55.289 --> 05:59.925
a pilot can pick this out
and go, boom, safety.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.094
Alright.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.895
Got this little dude here.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.164
This is my flat drag.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.200
This is an old tongue
of the trailer,

06:08.202 --> 06:09.835
modified it a little bit.

06:09.837 --> 06:13.905
Took a little bit of the nubs
off, and it's a flat drag.

06:13.907 --> 06:14.940
You've got to come up

06:14.942 --> 06:17.242
with tundra engineering
out here, man.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.145
This is a Sue fix.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.080
Here we go.

06:22.082 --> 06:27.886
Alright, now for me, what I'm
gonna do is just simply pull out

06:27.888 --> 06:30.789
and go up and down the runway,

06:30.791 --> 06:35.527
knocking anything that
might be in the way down.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.630
The whole purpose of Kavik
is safety and protection.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.632
I've got to have it flat,
and I've got to be able

06:40.634 --> 06:45.170
to put my little pots,
my little flames, on the sides.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.642
I do see myself
as a warden of the area.

06:50.644 --> 06:54.346
I take other people's safety
into consideration

06:54.348 --> 06:56.414
with far greater care
than my own.

06:56.416 --> 07:01.753
It makes me recognize I'm on the
right path for who I want to be,

07:01.755 --> 07:04.623
to make sure that I help people.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.392
To make sure that the job I do

07:07.394 --> 07:09.761
is the best that
I could do every day.

07:09.763 --> 07:13.632
And sometimes your best is just
being able to put on pants

07:13.634 --> 07:15.233
and brush your hair.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.102
You're not always
a rock star every day,

07:17.104 --> 07:21.973
sometimes you get
to be the groupie.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.643
The runway is looking
pretty good.

07:24.645 --> 07:28.580
But the vegetation is growing
taller than it ever has.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.349
That means I'm getting drifts
where they never have been.

07:31.351 --> 07:34.719
A plane lands
and runs into this,

07:34.721 --> 07:36.988
it's gonna do that and
kill everybody on board.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.724
I need to get my axes,
quack, quack,

07:39.726 --> 07:42.027
get the ones out
that I need out,

07:42.029 --> 07:45.630
go back in, start gathering
my flare pots.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.465
If I want to keep people safe,

07:47.467 --> 07:49.901
I just got to get my booty
out there to do it.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.907
JESSIE: Dog team is not
like a snow machine.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.475
Snow machine,
you never take it further

07:57.477 --> 07:58.844
than you can walk back out,

07:58.846 --> 08:02.147
because it's probably gonna
break down on you.

08:02.149 --> 08:14.759
¶ ¶

08:14.761 --> 08:16.895
Another beautiful morning
here in paradise.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.096
I'm packing up my sled.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.298
I'm getting ready to head out
for three days

08:20.300 --> 08:22.667
to a lake in the Alaska Range.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.603
Temperatures are dropping.
It's getting cold.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.037
This is a good time
to get out there.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.672
I'm gonna try to do
some ptarmigan hunting

08:27.674 --> 08:32.110
and some camping with
my five best dogs here.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.645
NARRATOR: Jessie Holmes
and his sled dogs

08:33.647 --> 08:36.481
have carved out their existence
along the Nenana River

08:36.483 --> 08:39.184
with the area's resources.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.886
To survive dark winter,

08:40.888 --> 08:44.155
Jessie and the dogs must
constantly scout new territory

08:44.157 --> 08:46.324
and hone their skills
in the wild.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.827
JESSIE: It's gonna be cold, so
I got to, like, have everything

08:48.829 --> 08:53.198
that I'm gonna need in my sled
to survive for a few days.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.933
I won't have the security
of a cabin,

08:54.935 --> 08:56.835
so all the things
that I take in my sled

08:56.837 --> 08:59.471
are super critical to me
being able to care for myself

08:59.473 --> 09:01.072
and my dogs out there.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.774
I don't plan on bringing
a lot of food.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.776
I plan on getting my food
off the land while I'm there,

09:04.778 --> 09:06.511
and that'll give me something
or a good reason

09:06.513 --> 09:08.647
to be out there testing
my survival skills

09:08.649 --> 09:10.081
in the cold temperatures.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.284
I feel that surviving
in the cold is like a knife.

09:12.286 --> 09:13.618
It gets dull sometimes,

09:13.620 --> 09:15.587
you got to take it out
and you got to keep it sharp.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.355
You got to keep
your skills polished here.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.392
So when I go out there
for three nights,

09:20.394 --> 09:23.094
and I just got me and my dogs
and what I got in this sled,

09:23.096 --> 09:24.796
I have to survive out of that.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.365
Checking everything over
in my mind right now,

09:27.367 --> 09:28.600
making sure that
I got everything

09:28.602 --> 09:30.235
I'm gonna need out there.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.972
I want my gun easily accessible
in case I see something.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.608
I'm always a little nervous
going into situations like this

09:36.610 --> 09:38.710
because I know what can happen.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.912
You don't think about the best,
you think about the worst,

09:40.914 --> 09:42.814
and you prepare for it.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.050
Who's ready to go? Huh?
Who's ready to go camping?

09:45.052 --> 09:46.718
Alright.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.488
I'm leaving the comfort
of my warm, cozy cabin behind,

09:50.490 --> 09:53.024
heading out into
the remote wilderness

09:53.026 --> 09:56.761
to test my survival skills.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.263
This isn't your average
camping trip.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.266
Most people don't go out camping
when it's 30, 40 below.

10:01.268 --> 10:05.270
When I'm in dog races, I could
be out there for up to 10 days,

10:05.272 --> 10:07.572
in extreme temperatures
of 50 below zero.

10:07.574 --> 10:10.275
So it's essential that
I am able to survive

10:10.277 --> 10:13.445
in those kind of conditions
and keep that skill set up.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.080
This just adds to my confidence

10:15.082 --> 10:17.749
that I can always go and
push through the storm.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.621
I need to make sure
I got a good place to camp,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.223
because it's getting dark.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.324
It's cold out.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.625
I want to be nice and settled in

10:27.627 --> 10:29.761
and know where I'm gonna be
sleeping tonight.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.229
Straight, straight.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.664
Straight ahead.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.265
Alright, Flash, straight ahead,
straight ahead.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.968
Straight on up in there.
Straight on up in there. Good!

10:36.970 --> 10:39.537
Alright, whoa, stay.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.039
Right here under
this big spruce tree

10:41.041 --> 10:43.508
looks like a good spot to camp.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.711
My next priority is to get
my dogs set up comfortably.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.314
Being a dog man, my number one
priority is my dogs.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.182
They're my transportation.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.818
They're how I got in here,
they're how I'm gonna get out.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.587
You guys like camping,
don't you?

10:55.589 --> 10:57.055
Yeah.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.790
Isn't that nice?

10:58.792 --> 11:01.993
It's gonna be cold tonight, want
you guys to be nice and warm.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.796
Well, I already feel warm.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.898
When I got here, I was cold,

11:06.900 --> 11:10.869
but this beautiful scenery
and my dogs warms my heart.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.504
I don't feel alone
when I'm out here.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.039
Feel like I got my best friends
with me,

11:14.041 --> 11:17.976
and tomorrow we can put
our focus on doing some hunting.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.444
We don't know what we're
gonna see tomorrow,

11:19.446 --> 11:21.079
and we're excited for it.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.052
GLENN: You got to make sure
that you choose the right path,

11:27.054 --> 11:30.355
because if you take the wrong
path, you can get stuck.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.757
You can get stuck
where you can't get out.

11:32.759 --> 11:41.299
¶ ¶

11:41.301 --> 11:43.001
This time of year,

11:43.003 --> 11:46.204
there could be caribou
in this area around my camp.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.473
So today, I'm gonna shoot my gun

11:48.475 --> 11:51.242
before I go out
and look for some.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.777
It's been a few months
since I pulled the trigger.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.946
The last time I shot
my .30-ought-6

11:54.948 --> 11:57.148
was the day I killed
my moose this fall.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.617
Today I'm gonna set up a target
out on the lake,

11:59.619 --> 12:01.019
shoot the gun a few times,

12:01.021 --> 12:03.088
then I'll go out
and look for caribou.

12:03.090 --> 12:06.157
I got to make sure this thing's
still shooting straight.

12:06.159 --> 12:10.595
In summertime, the sun goes
around a big circle up here.

12:10.597 --> 12:14.666
But in the wintertime,
it dips below the horizon,

12:14.668 --> 12:16.568
and it doesn't come up
over that mountain

12:16.570 --> 12:19.137
for 105 days every year.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.672
It's a long, cold winter.

12:20.674 --> 12:25.376
You need plenty of meat to eat
if you want to stay warm.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.512
I'll make a pile of snow.

12:27.514 --> 12:31.616
I'm setting up my target
right here.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.052
That's a good spot for it,
200 yards.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.320
This time of year,

12:35.322 --> 12:37.722
there can be caribou
in the area around my camp.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.558
I want to go out
looking for some.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.726
But first I want to make sure

12:41.728 --> 12:43.862
this gun's still shooting
where I aim it.

12:43.864 --> 12:48.233
¶ ¶

12:48.235 --> 12:49.601
[gunshot]

12:55.876 --> 12:56.808
[gunshot]

12:58.645 --> 13:01.646
Okay, I got to go
check my target.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.315
Oh, wow. What happened here?

13:04.317 --> 13:06.885
It hit the plywood, but
it didn't even hit the paper.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.987
When it's that far off,
that's no good.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.655
I can't hunt with a gun
like that.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.958
I'd end up missing caribou
or wounding them.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.827
That's why I'm testing it out.
Things can happen.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.129
It's been a few months
since I shot this thing,

13:18.131 --> 13:19.264
could have got bumped.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.732
It's 38 below right now,

13:20.734 --> 13:23.067
just those extreme temperature
changes that gun goes through

13:23.069 --> 13:24.669
can have an effect.

13:24.671 --> 13:29.107
It might be as simple
as adjusting the scope.

13:29.109 --> 13:34.245
Okay, I adjusted it,
four minutes of angle.

13:34.247 --> 13:39.150
¶ ¶

13:39.152 --> 13:40.552
Here it goes.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.057
[gunshot]

13:52.599 --> 13:54.766
I'm an opportunist.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.334
When I'm out in the woods,
I'm always hunting,

13:56.336 --> 13:57.535
I'm always looking at tracks,

13:57.537 --> 14:00.605
looking at sign,
looking for animals.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.575
Caribou are a very important
animal to me.

14:03.577 --> 14:07.612
In a typical year, about half
the meat I eat is caribou.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.882
And to get one caribou,
I get enough food for a month.

14:10.884 --> 14:16.487
¶ ¶

14:16.489 --> 14:18.189
Oh, nice!

14:18.191 --> 14:21.025
When I started out,
my first shot hit way down here.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.627
Didn't even hit paper.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.596
But with some adjustments,

14:24.598 --> 14:26.397
I've got it centered
on the target now.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.498
This is good.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.236
I can use this gun
to go hunt caribou now.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.171
It's a good day
to go out for a walk,

14:33.173 --> 14:37.342
see if I can find some caribou.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.244
Caribou are my favorite animal
to eat.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.279
If I could live off
just one animal,

14:41.281 --> 14:44.048
there's no doubt
it would be caribou.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.351
But even better is when
you've got variety,

14:46.353 --> 14:49.554
when you've got caribou
and moose meat.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.389
And right now,
all I've got's moose.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.491
I don't have any caribou.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.893
I haven't shot a caribou
since last winter.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.765
If I get any more meat
at this time of year,

15:00.767 --> 15:02.300
it will last longer.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.570
In the spring and even in the
summer, I'll still have meat.

15:05.572 --> 15:12.010
¶ ¶

15:12.012 --> 15:14.479
It's always nice to get up high,
gain some elevation.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.314
Because once I get
up above tree line,

15:16.316 --> 15:18.049
I get a great view
of the valley, too.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.417
I can look down
and see everything

15:19.419 --> 15:21.586
that I can't see
when I'm down here.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.257
It's getting steep.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.126
Even though I'm not
out of the woods,

15:28.128 --> 15:30.361
this is a pretty steep
mountainside.

15:30.363 --> 15:35.366
¶ ¶

15:35.368 --> 15:36.467
Whoa!

15:41.808 --> 15:45.109
Ah, oh, it's slippery up here.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.050
[grunting]

15:56.756 --> 15:58.355
[grunting]

16:00.960 --> 16:02.226
GLENN: Damn.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.628
Oh, that's slippery.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.530
Good thing it wasn't
any steeper.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.733
Last thing I need is
to bust my leg out here.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.236
NARRATOR: Glenn is searching
for caribou,

16:12.238 --> 16:16.373
an animal that provides half his
meat and protein for the year.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.876
But the animals are
migrating quickly,

16:18.878 --> 16:21.579
and locating the herd before
it leaves the region

16:21.581 --> 16:24.682
is of the utmost importance.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.518
GLENN: It's very exposed up here
out of the forest.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.519
The wind's really picking up.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.187
I got to get this face mask
on fast.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.123
I'll get frostbite
in no time up here.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.326
Oh, that'll protect me.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.927
That'll protect my face.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.329
Without this mask,

16:38.331 --> 16:40.998
I'd get frostbite pretty quickly
up here today.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.900
The wind's really blowing.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.602
But caribou love this habitat.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.638
Sometimes hundreds of them cross
right across the ridge up here.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.474
There could be some right on the
other side, just out of view.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.676
Won't know if I don't go see.

16:52.678 --> 17:14.198
¶ ¶

17:14.200 --> 17:16.967
There.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.670
Yeah.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.006
Get out my binoculars
and have a look around.

17:22.008 --> 17:29.847
¶ ¶

17:29.849 --> 17:31.148
This is a great vantage point,

17:31.150 --> 17:32.750
because I can see
all kinds of territory

17:32.752 --> 17:36.253
that I can't see
from down on the lake.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.656
I can see on the backside
of ridges up here.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.458
I can see other lakes
down the valley.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.964
It's really important to me
to get out,

17:46.966 --> 17:49.600
have a look around, because
if I don't go out of camp

17:49.602 --> 17:55.072
and walk around in this country,
I have no idea what's going on.

17:55.074 --> 17:59.209
Don't see any caribou
around today.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.178
It's getting dark.

18:01.180 --> 18:04.315
I got to get down the mountain.

18:04.317 --> 18:08.452
Time to head back to camp.

18:08.454 --> 18:11.055
Some steep sections
on this ridge.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.424
But it's the shortest way
back to camp.

18:13.426 --> 18:28.405
¶ ¶

18:28.407 --> 18:29.840
[sniffling]

18:29.842 --> 18:36.880
¶ ¶

18:36.882 --> 18:38.315
Whoa.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.050
Oh.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.935
Just got to get down
this one last steep place.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.738
I got to be careful, some
of this rock's pretty loose.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.973
Can't quite feel my next step.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.908
There.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.678
Just got this one last steep
section, then I'm home free.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.946
[exhales]

19:08.948 --> 19:13.751
Just got to take my time,
I don't want to rush.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.686
Almost down.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.422
Almost down.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.061
There! I made it.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.295
Whew.

19:25.297 --> 19:26.630
Okay, now I'm home free.

19:28.768 --> 19:36.140
¶ ¶

19:36.142 --> 19:38.942
ANDY: Experience is knowledge,
knowledge is confidence,

19:38.944 --> 19:41.712
confidence is success,
and they all go together.

19:47.920 --> 19:52.089
Well, I feel like I'm getting
pretty close to completion here.

19:52.091 --> 19:56.560
I'm working on standing up
the sail and the boom.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.028
NARRATOR: In dark winter,

19:58.030 --> 20:02.599
Andy uses his sled dogs to
access resources for survival.

20:02.601 --> 20:06.003
Training the dogs this
time of year is critical.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.606
But with a lack of snowfall,
Andy must complete his iceboat

20:09.608 --> 20:12.609
to break in the dogs
on the frozen lake.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.545
ANDY: I've always wanted
to try the ice sailing

20:14.547 --> 20:16.413
ever since I moved out here.

20:16.415 --> 20:19.450
[drill ratcheting]

20:19.452 --> 20:22.653
It's always been something that
I kind of dreamed of doing,

20:22.655 --> 20:25.556
because I've got a big lake
that's glare ice

20:25.558 --> 20:30.461
for a good part of the
early winter and late winter.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.463
Still got a few
minor things to do,

20:32.465 --> 20:35.365
but I want to see how this
boom's gonna sit on here,

20:35.367 --> 20:38.669
how these bars will
sit on there.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.572
In through here.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.843
That's gonna control
where my sail goes out at.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.580
I let my sail out that far, and
then it's gonna hit the shrouds.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.916
And when I want to tighten up on
it, sail in tight to the wind,

20:52.918 --> 20:55.819
I can just pull around in tight.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.387
I've never iceboated before.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.389
I've, all I've ever done
is sail on water,

20:59.391 --> 21:01.125
so I have no idea

21:01.127 --> 21:03.727
what an iceboat's
supposed to track like.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.330
As far as I'm concerned
for what I'm trying to do,

21:06.332 --> 21:10.267
if the wind will push it down
the lake and I can come back,

21:10.269 --> 21:13.070
then it's a success.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.005
I think that looks pretty good.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.740
Time to get it out on the lake.

21:16.742 --> 21:21.745
¶ ¶

21:21.747 --> 21:23.413
Yay, Natty.

21:23.415 --> 21:29.553
[dog whimpering]

21:29.555 --> 21:31.021
Yeah!

21:31.023 --> 21:33.056
Oh, boy!

21:33.058 --> 21:35.492
Yay! You gonna help me?

21:35.494 --> 21:37.828
You gonna help me put
this boat together?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.496
[whimpering]
You want to?

21:39.498 --> 21:41.799
Okay, we can do it together.

21:41.801 --> 21:48.138
¶ ¶

21:48.140 --> 21:49.540
I got the boat done.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.342
I'm just gonna get it all set up
to where all I got to do is,

21:52.344 --> 21:56.680
on a windy day, is come out here
and hook it up and go.

21:56.682 --> 21:57.981
Pretty much everything
you do out here

21:57.983 --> 22:00.417
is dependent on what the weather

22:00.419 --> 22:02.252
and what Mother Nature's
throwing at you,

22:02.254 --> 22:07.090
and so this is, this boat's
dependent on wind to go.

22:07.092 --> 22:09.626
I think I can have it
pretty much ready

22:09.628 --> 22:11.762
to where whenever I'm ready
and the dogs are ready,

22:11.764 --> 22:14.932
we can just put it up and go.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.234
So I'm just gonna
put my mast in.

22:17.236 --> 22:20.170
Alright. Getting that stay
nice and tight.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.638
We're gonna bring
the big dogs out here,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.074
and you're gonna teach them
how to run around on ice.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.909
[laughs]

22:25.911 --> 22:30.113
¶ ¶

22:30.115 --> 22:32.382
Alright, Natty,
what do you think?

22:32.384 --> 22:34.618
Ready to go home?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.053
The whole purpose of this

22:36.055 --> 22:38.956
is that I can turn all my dogs
loose at one time, get out,

22:38.958 --> 22:43.894
have some fun, do some training,
and build confidence.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.196
That's all I need.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.831
Come on, Natty!

22:47.833 --> 22:53.170
¶ ¶

22:54.440 --> 22:57.007

22:57.009 --> 22:59.877
JESSIE: I got my dogs, they'll
pull me through any storm.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.579
They rely on me
and I rely on them.

23:05.718 --> 23:09.953
¶ ¶

23:09.955 --> 23:11.922
Yeah, hi.

23:11.924 --> 23:15.659
I'm gonna go out on the tundra
and look for some ptarmigan.

23:15.661 --> 23:16.793
Alright, guys.

23:16.795 --> 23:20.664
Straight ahead.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.699
And the sun's going down
over that mountain soon,

23:22.701 --> 23:24.635
so I got a limited
amount of time

23:24.637 --> 23:27.204
to go catch something
for dinner.

23:27.206 --> 23:30.140
I've got my eyes peeled
wide open for some ptarmigan.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.942
I didn't bring
a lot of food out here

23:31.944 --> 23:36.146
in hopes of keeping myself
hungry and motivated

23:36.148 --> 23:39.783
to get some fresh food.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.618
Hup, hup. Good, straight up.

23:41.620 --> 23:42.819
Hup, hup, whoa.

23:47.459 --> 23:49.593
That's ptarmigan tracks
right there.

23:52.831 --> 23:54.831
This is a good sign.

23:54.833 --> 24:04.975
¶ ¶

24:04.977 --> 24:06.209
Head on down the trail

24:06.211 --> 24:09.346
and see if I can't
flush some up somewhere.

24:09.348 --> 24:12.349
We only got a little while
before it gets dark, so.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.654
There's ptarmigan tracks
all over out here,

24:17.656 --> 24:19.990
so far, I haven't seen any.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.758
They're out here, though.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.607
This place is covered
in ptarmigan tracks,

24:37.609 --> 24:39.977
so I just got to make sure
I keep going

24:39.979 --> 24:44.581
and act as quick as I possibly
can when I run into them.

24:44.583 --> 24:45.782
Alright, boys.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.217
Alright.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.785
Hup, hup.

25:02.368 --> 25:03.467
Haw.

25:03.469 --> 25:06.336
Haw, straight ahead.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.604
Whoa.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.006
Easy.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.009
Whoa.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.945
Oh, man, I got to check this out
before I go across that.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.814
I don't want to get soaking wet
in these temperatures.

25:17.816 --> 25:21.351
Gonna make sure this stuff's
solid before I go across it.

25:24.623 --> 25:25.622
Whoa.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.361
Too deep, I'm gonna reroute
a trail around this.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.664
What I got to do is make sure
that the dogs go through here,

25:34.666 --> 25:36.233
and not through here.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.768
That'd be some wet dogs.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.903
But I'm determined
to get some ptarmigan,

25:39.905 --> 25:42.906
and I'm not gonna let
a little water deter me.

25:45.611 --> 25:47.010
Gee, gee.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.979
Hey, gee, straight ahead.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.013
Straight ahead, good.

25:50.015 --> 25:50.947
Straight ahead.

25:50.949 --> 25:51.848
Alright, alright.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.184
Easy, easy.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.652
Easy.

25:55.654 --> 25:56.686
Come on, now, straight up.

25:56.688 --> 25:58.855
There we go.

25:58.857 --> 26:00.424
We're across,
we're keeping on moving,

26:00.426 --> 26:01.858
looking for some ptarmigan.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.160
Ain't gonna teach
these dogs nothing

26:03.162 --> 26:06.396
by turning around on
a little something like that.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.031
Let's go get that dinner.

26:10.736 --> 26:14.104
Let's check this trail out,
boys, see what's up here.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.807
There you go, up that,
up that, up that.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.675
Pretty steep stuff.

26:18.677 --> 26:21.111
Whoa, boys, stay.

26:21.113 --> 26:26.416
Looks like we're running out
of good trail here, guys.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.418
Wow, it's beautiful up here.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.853
Hi, Flash.

26:29.855 --> 26:32.956
Yeah, we run right out of trail,
didn't we, buddy?

26:32.958 --> 26:34.558
Boy, we got to figure out how

26:34.560 --> 26:36.059
we're gonna get turned around
out here.

26:36.061 --> 26:38.061
I don't want to keep
going up that.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.030
It's gonna be a little bit
of a tricky turnaround.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.565
You guys just listen to me,
okay?

26:41.567 --> 26:42.499
Come on.

26:42.501 --> 26:44.334
Let's go back. Easy, easy.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.269
Oh, easy.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.771
Easy now.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.072
Easy, easy.

26:49.074 --> 26:50.740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:50.742 --> 26:51.575
Easy!

26:51.577 --> 26:52.909
Whoa!

26:52.911 --> 26:54.711
Whoa, whoa.

26:54.713 --> 26:55.479
Whoa!

26:57.417 --> 26:58.516
JESSIE: Easy! Whoa!

26:58.518 --> 27:00.318
Whoa, whoa.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.552
Whoa!

27:10.663 --> 27:12.597
[sigh]

27:12.599 --> 27:14.398
Whoa, whoa.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.933
Well, got the dogs
turned around.

27:15.935 --> 27:19.904
That was a little bit more
excitement than I was expecting,

27:19.906 --> 27:21.806
but didn't lose the team.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.708
Number one thing we learned
when we start mushing

27:23.710 --> 27:26.844
is never let go of the sled,
because there goes your team.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.547
Still a little steep
negotiating out of here.

27:29.549 --> 27:32.683
Whoa, easy, easy, whoa.

27:32.685 --> 27:33.618
Easy.

27:33.620 --> 27:34.785
Whoa!

27:34.787 --> 27:36.888
Easy, whoa!

27:36.890 --> 27:38.756
Haw, haw, haw.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.325
Easy, whoa.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.395
Alright.

27:44.397 --> 27:45.796
The real thing that
I'm doing out here

27:45.798 --> 27:47.331
is putting myself to the test,

27:47.333 --> 27:49.734
and I'm putting my skills
to the test.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.736
This is the kind of thing
that me and the dogs live for,

27:51.738 --> 27:53.638
getting out,
exploring new country,

27:53.640 --> 27:57.508
and spending time together
on the trail.

27:57.510 --> 27:58.743
Alright.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.945
Whoa.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.914
Good dogs. Stay.

28:02.916 --> 28:04.749
Gonna head out.

28:04.751 --> 28:07.885
We'll walk about and see if
I can't drum something up here.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.158
In one last effort,
try to get some ptarmigan.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.827
Doing everything that I can.

28:20.233 --> 28:22.667
Oh.

28:22.669 --> 28:26.203
I got some fresh fox tracks
heading up this creek.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.206
This fox is in the business
of getting ptarmigan,

28:29.208 --> 28:30.675
and that's how he gets by,

28:30.677 --> 28:34.412
so think I'm gonna head up
this creek and check it out.

28:40.887 --> 28:45.656
Oh, [bleep]!

28:45.658 --> 28:49.226
[bleep]

28:49.228 --> 28:51.128
Just broke
through the ice there.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.430
I was standing
off to the side here

28:52.432 --> 28:53.998
and just kind of
giving it a check,

28:54.000 --> 28:58.135
and it was so thin that
my boot went right through it,

28:58.137 --> 29:00.204
almost up to my knee.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.706
I was trying to follow
these fox tracks.

29:01.708 --> 29:02.974
They're a better hunter than me,

29:02.976 --> 29:07.345
but they're also 10 pounds
and I'm 160.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.448
Whoa.

29:10.450 --> 29:13.517
There's the bottom.

29:13.519 --> 29:14.719
Looks like I could've
went deeper.

29:14.721 --> 29:16.721
I pulled myself out
just in time.

29:16.723 --> 29:19.190
If I got waist-deep wet,
all I'd be able to do

29:19.192 --> 29:22.159
is go and look for some dry wood
and build a fire

29:22.161 --> 29:25.129
as quick as possible with
these subzero temperatures.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.931
These are the kind of things
that can happen out here,

29:26.933 --> 29:28.432
when you're out here
by yourself,

29:28.434 --> 29:31.002
you have to be careful.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.643
¶ ¶

29:38.645 --> 29:39.944
The sun's going down right now.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.179
It's getting cold out again.

29:42.181 --> 29:45.483
Certain point,
you got to call it quits.

29:45.485 --> 29:47.351
I've covered a lot of ground.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.153
I haven't found anything.

29:49.155 --> 29:52.223
Would've liked to got some
ptarmigan, but being 30 below,

29:52.225 --> 29:54.859
things don't always
go the way you want it to.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.360
You boys ready?

29:56.362 --> 29:59.130
Alright, come alive, Flash.

29:59.132 --> 30:01.132
I need to get back to camp
and wrap things up.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.367
It's gonna be
a long run tomorrow

30:03.369 --> 30:06.804
to make it all the way
back to Nenana.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.372
So tomorrow is gonna be a day

30:08.374 --> 30:10.808
that we're all gonna
need our rest for.

30:14.247 --> 30:18.249
SUE: We need to care about
each other as a society.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.451
Live your life,
not somebody else's,

30:20.453 --> 30:22.820
but take care of your neighbor.

30:22.822 --> 30:30.394
¶ ¶

30:30.396 --> 30:33.364
NARRATOR: Kavik is a designated
airport and fueling station

30:33.366 --> 30:35.332
for the Arctic's planes.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.369
Having an unsafe runway could
risk the lives of pilots

30:38.371 --> 30:41.072
attempting an emergency landing.

30:41.074 --> 30:42.606
To prevent disaster,

30:42.608 --> 30:45.876
Sue must clear the runway
of all potential hazards.

30:45.878 --> 30:48.612
SUE: I got the runway
flattened and widened.

30:48.614 --> 30:52.717
What I want to do today
is get the axe,

30:52.719 --> 30:54.919
cut down some of that brush
that's in my way,

30:54.921 --> 30:56.387
just so I don't have
a lot of drifting

30:56.389 --> 30:58.422
on that section I've set aside.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.458
Every time you have brush

31:00.460 --> 31:03.627
that sticks up higher than
the snow in the ground,

31:03.629 --> 31:05.496
you're gonna have a drift.

31:05.498 --> 31:08.132
So, if there's a big clump
of large willow,

31:08.134 --> 31:10.334
those have to be knocked down.

31:15.108 --> 31:17.541
Willow is a lot like vine maple.

31:17.543 --> 31:18.843
Even in the winter,

31:18.845 --> 31:22.046
it wants to split and
wrap around everything.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.247
Chopping down the willows

31:23.249 --> 31:25.649
is a lot like mowing the lawn
in the Arctic;

31:25.651 --> 31:29.120
it's regular routine
maintenance.

31:29.122 --> 31:31.322
When I'm picking which ones
are gonna give me an issue,

31:31.324 --> 31:34.158
which willow, right here
it doesn't seem like

31:34.160 --> 31:35.559
these are gonna be a problem,

31:35.561 --> 31:38.028
but look, I've got
bigger drifts here.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.196
Why is that an issue?

31:39.198 --> 31:42.066
A plane tries to land,
if he tries to land,

31:42.068 --> 31:44.735
here's your runway,
here's a big old bush,

31:44.737 --> 31:46.604
and here's a drift
that it created.

31:46.606 --> 31:48.239
Dude tries to land--poof--

31:48.241 --> 31:51.976
he's gonna, you're gonna
kill some people.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.512
I have no desire
to ruin the ecosystem,

31:54.514 --> 31:57.248
I just need to not have it
encroach the runway.

31:57.250 --> 32:00.985
We have more bush pilots than
we have, you know, anything else

32:00.987 --> 32:02.887
for forms of transportation.

32:02.889 --> 32:07.358
The life of a bush pilot is
perhaps thrilling but short.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.094
Alaska loses a lot
of pilots every year.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.930
It's just a tricky
damn place to fly.

32:12.932 --> 32:17.067
It really ratchets up my desire
to make it a little safer.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.936
Safety is always first.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.337
The state of Alaska,

32:20.339 --> 32:22.006
you can do anything you have
to do to keep yourself safe,

32:22.008 --> 32:24.575
and certainly they want
to keep the pilots safe.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.580
I just finished doing
the maintenance on the runway

32:29.582 --> 32:31.649
as far as the willow brush goes.

32:31.651 --> 32:33.083
Now I'll get in Little Red,

32:33.085 --> 32:35.452
start collecting
my little flare pots,

32:35.454 --> 32:37.388
and making sure
that those are good.

32:43.729 --> 32:47.198
ANDY: I'm kind of hard
on everything I use out here,

32:47.200 --> 32:50.568
and I test its limits
all the time.

32:50.570 --> 33:04.415
¶ ¶

33:04.417 --> 33:05.883
We got some wind out here,
you guys.

33:05.885 --> 33:09.186
Let's try this boat out.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.354
Let's get this thing uncovered

33:10.356 --> 33:12.756
and see what we can do
in the wind.

33:12.758 --> 33:18.162
I built this iceboat,
and today, I got some wind.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.997
So, I want to see what it does
out on the lake.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.566
I've got some pretty
gusty winds here,

33:22.568 --> 33:24.735
and so I'm hoping that
there'll be enough wind force

33:24.737 --> 33:28.839
to even push it
through the snow.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.942
I'm really excited to see
what this thing will do.

33:31.944 --> 33:33.444
Never done this before.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.947
So it's all, it's all new to me.

33:36.949 --> 33:39.984
This is just a trial and error,
see what happens.

33:39.986 --> 33:41.485
I think I better turn this
into the wind

33:41.487 --> 33:43.787
before I raise this up, though.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.390
I can get into
real trouble here. Yeah.

33:46.392 --> 33:49.660
As soon as I raise that sail,
it's gonna want to go.

33:49.662 --> 33:50.794
Oh, yeah.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.396
We'll have some fun out here.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.999
The most important thing
for these dogs is training,

33:55.001 --> 33:58.102
and getting the dogs trained
in all conditions is important.

33:58.104 --> 34:01.238
And ice is probably
the most difficult condition

34:01.240 --> 34:02.873
to train dogs for.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.041
Every year, you have to

34:04.043 --> 34:06.644
kind of reintroduce everything
to the dogs.

34:06.646 --> 34:10.247
There's some insecurity that
builds up around ice conditions.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.549
And one of the things about
running on ice with the dogs

34:12.551 --> 34:13.784
is they can fall down

34:13.786 --> 34:16.453
and they can get injured
really easily on the ice.

34:16.455 --> 34:19.056
They'll hurt a shoulder,
they'll hurt their wrists,

34:19.058 --> 34:20.624
they can throw out their hips.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.559
It's important for the dogs
to be comfortable

34:22.561 --> 34:24.862
running on the ice, feel secure,

34:24.864 --> 34:28.732
and so hopefully we'll be able
to get some confidence built up.

34:31.203 --> 34:32.703
Woo!

34:32.705 --> 34:36.440
Quite a few days of time and
effort went into building this.

34:36.442 --> 34:41.211
I'm hoping like hell it's gonna
pay off for me right now.

34:41.213 --> 34:45.382
Alright.

34:45.384 --> 34:47.384
Let's go. Come, come, come!

34:47.386 --> 34:50.454
Yeah, buddy, woo-hoo!

34:50.456 --> 34:54.491
Come on, boys!

34:54.493 --> 34:56.293
Yee-haw!

34:56.295 --> 34:58.462
Come on, boys, let's go!

35:00.733 --> 35:02.333
Yeah, buddy.

35:02.335 --> 35:03.767
Woo-hoo!

35:06.939 --> 35:08.505
Come on, boys!

35:12.445 --> 35:17.147
Whoa, the winds are changing.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.449
Oh, [bleep].

35:21.887 --> 35:24.821
ANDY: Woo-hoo!

35:24.823 --> 35:28.091
Whoa.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.993
The winds are changing.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.062
Oh, [bleep].

35:32.064 --> 35:34.364
I think I just bent my mast.

35:34.366 --> 35:37.067
Son of a bitch.

35:37.069 --> 35:39.035
I don't know if it's because
there's so much resistance

35:39.037 --> 35:41.271
to the snow, but it was
going really good.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.873
And soon as I caught
a good gust of wind,

35:43.875 --> 35:47.310
it just bent this mast right,
right here at this point.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.546
That's kind of a thin, cheap,
aluminum pole,

35:49.548 --> 35:51.881
so I'm gonna have to make
a better mast for this.

35:51.883 --> 35:55.518
I just got to run home
and do a quick fix, come back,

35:55.520 --> 35:56.953
and I can be back in business

35:56.955 --> 35:59.823
and have some more fun
with the dogs.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.157
That's really disappointing,
though,

36:01.159 --> 36:03.360
because it was working
really good.

36:03.362 --> 36:04.661
Oh, this was a blast, man.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.831
This thing was smoking
across the lake, I loved it.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.432
Alright, you guys.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.434
Let's take this home
and we'll do round two.

36:11.436 --> 36:13.236
Come on, boys.

36:13.238 --> 36:15.538
Let's go back and we'll get
a better mast going here.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.774
¶ ¶

36:24.282 --> 36:25.648
So if that was bigger,

36:25.650 --> 36:27.550
I'd consider putting
a wooden pole in there,

36:27.552 --> 36:30.019
but I could probably snap
that off in a heavy wind,

36:30.021 --> 36:33.256
so I'm just gonna go
with a piece of steel,

36:33.258 --> 36:35.792
and hope like heck it's enough.

36:35.794 --> 36:46.469
¶ ¶

36:46.471 --> 36:49.139
I've got a steel pole now
instead of aluminum.

36:49.141 --> 36:52.175
It's quite a bit heavier.

36:52.177 --> 36:54.544
I think what I need to do
is just until I get a sense

36:54.546 --> 36:55.845
of how strong this thing is,

36:55.847 --> 36:57.680
I need to take it easy
in the wind

36:57.682 --> 37:00.116
and don't sail it too tight
to the wind.

37:00.118 --> 37:02.719
If this bends, then
I got some serious wind

37:02.721 --> 37:06.222
and some serious problems.

37:06.224 --> 37:10.226
Let's go see if it can
take the winds again.

37:10.228 --> 37:15.932
¶ ¶

37:15.934 --> 37:17.267
Here we go.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.902
Come on, pups.

37:18.904 --> 37:22.138
Let's go see if
this thing works.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.274
We need some wind, boys.

37:24.276 --> 37:25.542
Come on, wind.

37:25.544 --> 37:30.480
¶ ¶

37:30.482 --> 37:31.548
There we go.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.082
Woo-hoo!

37:33.084 --> 37:34.617
Come on, boys!

37:37.622 --> 37:40.890
Woo-hoo! Let's go, boys.

37:40.892 --> 37:41.991
Woo!

37:45.931 --> 37:48.932
Come on, boys!

37:48.934 --> 37:50.567
This is working really good.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.502
I think the dogs are gonna
benefit from this.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.204
I'm gonna benefit from it.

37:54.206 --> 37:57.140
There's more playtime, and
it was something new for them,

37:57.142 --> 37:59.843
and they all were just having
a ball chasing me around.

37:59.845 --> 38:02.679
So, I think
it's time well spent,

38:02.681 --> 38:05.548
getting out on Ford Lake
with the dogs out on the ice.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.717
Getting them comfortable,
getting them confident,

38:07.719 --> 38:10.286
and then getting them
to follow me on the iceboat

38:10.288 --> 38:12.388
was a pretty big accomplishment,

38:12.390 --> 38:15.225
and it's set me up for some
really good dog training

38:15.227 --> 38:17.060
early in the season.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.194
Way to run.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.396
You guys ran all the way down
the lake.

38:20.398 --> 38:21.664
It's just fun.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.933
It's fun to use what
Mother Nature puts out there

38:23.935 --> 38:26.769
for me to use, so it's good.

38:26.771 --> 38:29.005
The Blade Runners is running.

38:29.007 --> 38:32.008
Yay, everybody's having
a good time on the lake.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.243
Woo-hoo!

38:33.245 --> 38:34.577
[laughs]

38:38.383 --> 38:39.983
GLENN: When you travel
through these mountains

38:39.985 --> 38:42.185
up in the Arctic,
you make your own route,

38:42.187 --> 38:43.586
you find your own way,

38:43.588 --> 38:45.989
and there are obstacles
every step of the way.

38:47.826 --> 38:53.796
[crackling, popping]

38:53.798 --> 38:57.000
Nice to warm the hands up after
a long day on the mountain.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.402
[crackling, popping]

38:59.404 --> 39:04.240
Oh, yeah, that's gonna cook up
some backstrap there.

39:04.242 --> 39:08.344
Moose backstrap. Look at that.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.415
This is some of the best meat
on an entire moose right here.

39:12.417 --> 39:14.951
I killed this moose that
I'm eating right now tonight,

39:14.953 --> 39:16.219
and that's a good feeling.

39:16.221 --> 39:18.154
I know where my food came from.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.355
I'd just rather run around
on these mountains

39:19.357 --> 39:20.623
looking for something to eat

39:20.625 --> 39:24.027
than just buying it all the time
in a grocery store.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.729
If you're a hunter, you're very
tuned into the environment.

39:26.731 --> 39:30.533
And the way you stay tuned into
it is by being out in it.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.168
Caribou come and go.

39:32.170 --> 39:35.405
Sometimes they're in the area,
sometimes they're not around.

39:35.407 --> 39:37.774
But you won't know
if you don't go and look.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.809
That's what hunting's all about.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.210
Right now, there are
no caribou around.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.645
Tomorrow there might be.

39:42.647 --> 39:45.582
[sizzling]

39:45.584 --> 39:47.016
Dinner is served.

39:47.018 --> 39:52.622
¶ ¶

39:52.624 --> 39:56.025
Mmm. That's a good-eating moose
right there.

39:56.027 --> 39:58.561
There were times when
I first came out here,

39:58.563 --> 40:03.132
the first couple years,
when I wasn't as experienced,

40:03.134 --> 40:06.336
and I did things a little
differently than I do them now.

40:06.338 --> 40:07.637
I didn't have enough meat
put away,

40:07.639 --> 40:09.439
I didn't have enough meat
put up on the cache.

40:09.441 --> 40:11.307
One year I ran out,
and I was living hand-to-mouth.

40:11.309 --> 40:13.176
If I didn't get an animal
when I went out hunting,

40:13.178 --> 40:15.979
I didn't eat that night.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.548
But now I plan things out
a little bit better than that.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.084
Make sure that if those caribou
don't show up,

40:21.086 --> 40:24.220
I'm still not gonna go hungry.

40:24.222 --> 40:27.557
Because the caribou
are unreliable.

40:27.559 --> 40:28.725
But now I know better,

40:28.727 --> 40:30.326
I know you can't always
count on the caribou,

40:30.328 --> 40:32.562
that's something I learned
a long time ago.

40:32.564 --> 40:37.367
So you want to make sure you
get plenty of meat in the fall.

40:37.369 --> 40:39.302
See you through just in case
the caribou don't show up.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.676
JESSIE: If something
goes wrong out here,

40:46.678 --> 40:49.846
I'm on my own, and
there's nobody to save me.

40:49.848 --> 41:00.089
¶ ¶

41:00.091 --> 41:02.258
Fire out here is your lifeline.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.260
Without fire,
you ain't got much out here.

41:04.262 --> 41:06.295
This is cold country.

41:06.297 --> 41:10.233
[crackling, popping]

41:10.235 --> 41:12.402
To me, it's just nice
to get away from home,

41:12.404 --> 41:18.441
and get out here, somewhere new,
and learn some new things.

41:18.443 --> 41:21.411
I was kind of hoping to catch
something to cook tonight,

41:21.413 --> 41:26.649
but it got kind of late on me,
didn't see anything.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.818
It's disappointing to come out
of somewhere empty-handed,

41:28.820 --> 41:31.421
but at home,
there's nothing but security.

41:31.423 --> 41:36.426
Out here, there's adventure
and adversity and challenge,

41:36.428 --> 41:38.461
and those are the kind of things
that make us a team.

41:38.463 --> 41:40.496
[dog howls]

41:40.498 --> 41:42.899
I think that it's a good
confidence builder for them

41:42.901 --> 41:44.567
to be out here
in these temperatures

41:44.569 --> 41:46.069
and know that I'm gonna
take care of them

41:46.071 --> 41:47.537
and provide for all their needs,

41:47.539 --> 41:49.439
and that just builds
a trust and a bond,

41:49.441 --> 41:52.041
and that's what we thrive off of

41:52.043 --> 41:54.310
is our trust and bond
in each other.

41:58.383 --> 42:01.784
That's what this trip's
all about is coming out here

42:01.786 --> 42:05.354
and enjoying a nice couple
nights camping and hunting

42:05.356 --> 42:08.658
in some great country with
some great company for my dogs.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.660
Yeah, good boys.

42:10.662 --> 42:13.129
This is as good as it gets
out here.

42:13.131 --> 42:15.398
It's still cold
and tough out here,

42:15.400 --> 42:20.203
but this is as comfortable
as we can be.

42:20.205 --> 42:21.871
Getting out of
this comfort zone,

42:21.873 --> 42:25.074
testing my survival skills,
is keeping my knife sharp,

42:25.076 --> 42:28.811
so when things do go wrong,
I'm ready.

42:28.813 --> 42:30.780
It's good knowing that
I put a good effort in

42:30.782 --> 42:32.548
at the end of the day.

42:32.550 --> 42:36.986
This is what I love doing,
and I'm happy to be out here.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.554
I wouldn't want to be
anywhere else right now

42:38.556 --> 42:40.089
than under this tree.

42:40.091 --> 42:46.863
¶ ¶

42:46.865 --> 42:49.465
SUE: People weren't meant to be
out here, but you know what?

42:49.467 --> 42:51.033
[bleep] that, I can do it.

42:51.035 --> 42:53.870
50 and fat is not
a stopping point for me,

42:53.872 --> 42:56.606
it just makes the challenge
that much sweeter when I win.

43:00.912 --> 43:14.824
¶ ¶

43:14.826 --> 43:17.426
A little bit more.

43:17.428 --> 43:18.728
Planes have been calling,

43:18.730 --> 43:21.030
wanted to know if I'm ready
for the dark time.

43:21.032 --> 43:24.133
So the goal tonight is
to get these checked out,

43:24.135 --> 43:27.036
make sure I have enough of them
that are in good shape,

43:27.038 --> 43:29.872
get them filled up,
get the wicks in.

43:29.874 --> 43:32.141
I have to have
my flare pot system ready

43:32.143 --> 43:34.844
so that people can land.

43:34.846 --> 43:38.114
You want a nice, fresh,
clean wick.

43:38.116 --> 43:43.286
A clean surface is gonna light
fire easier and burn brighter.

43:43.288 --> 43:45.221
There we go. He's awful cute.

43:45.223 --> 43:47.990
So I'm gonna stuff
this little dude in there,

43:47.992 --> 43:51.027
screw this down,
another one good to go.

43:53.031 --> 43:57.533
So this whole process is
kind of slow and repetitive,

43:57.535 --> 44:03.239
but the payoff is the potential
for safe nighttime landings.

44:03.241 --> 44:09.445
¶ ¶

44:09.447 --> 44:13.082
I filled up all these
little flare pots.

44:13.084 --> 44:16.252
Let's get rock and rolling.

44:16.254 --> 44:19.255
Now I'm going to the runway,
and what I'm gonna do,

44:19.257 --> 44:23.092
I'm gonna light a T,
to show from the air,

44:23.094 --> 44:26.295
the pilot will see,
this is the area I land,

44:26.297 --> 44:29.565
this is the area that takes me
into safety and Sue.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.937
Alright.

44:34.939 --> 44:44.013
¶ ¶

44:44.015 --> 44:46.215
I cannot put out so many

44:46.217 --> 44:51.153
that the pilot is going to have
a difficult time distinguishing,

44:51.155 --> 44:53.689
what's the runway,
what's the turn-in?

45:00.632 --> 45:04.300
Can only do a couple
at a time here.

45:04.302 --> 45:07.103
Okay.

45:07.105 --> 45:08.938
I'm looking across the way,

45:08.940 --> 45:11.540
trying to make it equidistant
on both sides.

45:11.542 --> 45:19.782
¶ ¶

45:19.784 --> 45:21.784
Got to have one here.

45:24.289 --> 45:28.891
Propane gels
at 30, 40 below zero.

45:28.893 --> 45:31.961
So I got to keep
everything warm.

45:31.963 --> 45:40.169
¶ ¶

45:40.171 --> 45:41.971
When I was very, very tiny,

45:41.973 --> 45:43.873
and they ask you what do you
want to be when you grow up?

45:43.875 --> 45:46.142
I always said lighthouse keeper.

45:46.144 --> 45:49.745
And in my own way, I am.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.247
What does a lighthouse do?

45:51.249 --> 45:57.353
It is a shining beacon to remind
people where safe channels are.

45:57.355 --> 46:01.724
I want to be the beacon
that leads people to safety.

46:03.695 --> 46:06.595
I'm gonna go down here,
I'm gonna turn off my lights,

46:06.597 --> 46:09.932
and I'm just gonna see,
can I, can I see

46:09.934 --> 46:12.301
that this is a straight,
unbroken line of lights?

46:12.303 --> 46:17.273
And just see what it looks like.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.008
Because I want to live alone

46:19.010 --> 46:22.545
doesn't mean I don't care
about the rest of the planet.

46:22.547 --> 46:25.848
If I think you're my family,
you're under my protection.

46:25.850 --> 46:28.150
Gonna shut off my main lights,

46:28.152 --> 46:31.654
and determine visually,
did I do a good job?

46:31.656 --> 46:34.457
Can an airplane see this?
Can they recognize it?

46:34.459 --> 46:37.326
Will they go, this is
a straight line, it's a runway?

46:37.328 --> 46:39.095
And they absolutely can.

46:39.097 --> 46:42.098
We got her lit up.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.100
For somebody 50 miles away

46:44.102 --> 46:46.736
that's starting to have
engine trouble, guess what.

46:46.738 --> 46:50.439
They're gonna see this and go,
'Oh, my God, someplace to land.'

46:50.441 --> 46:51.474
That's what I need to be.

46:51.476 --> 46:52.775

46:52.777 --> 46:55.678
in the middle of a turbulent
set of circumstances.
