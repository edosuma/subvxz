01:04.500 --> 01:07.343
Toro! Toro! Toro!

01:10.172 --> 01:13.023
Toro! Toro! Toro!

01:27.500 --> 01:30.827
- Whose idea was this, anyway?
- They're gaining on us.

01:30.927 --> 01:33.190
Andale! Andale!

01:40.958 --> 01:42.199
Yeah! Yeah!

01:47.789 --> 01:48.789
Whoa!

01:56.714 --> 01:58.440
He's after me!

02:03.805 --> 02:04.805
Phil!

02:06.265 --> 02:08.351
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

02:18.722 --> 02:19.922
Jesus!

02:32.001 --> 02:33.001
Ed!

02:33.377 --> 02:34.920
Go, Mitch!

02:42.511 --> 02:44.803
Stay, bull. Stay, bull.
Stay, bull!

02:47.891 --> 02:49.640
Stop following me!

02:54.931 --> 02:56.132
Please!

05:40.361 --> 05:42.811
Does he know what he's doing?
Has he any idea what he's doing?

05:42.911 --> 05:44.752
Cause you know
I can't talk to 'im. Ow.

05:45.407 --> 05:47.297
Relax.
He's doing a beautiful job.

05:47.397 --> 05:50.788
Sir! El doctor. Hello!

05:52.581 --> 05:55.618
Don't sew up anything that's
supposed to remain open, okay?

05:55.718 --> 05:56.718
Si.

06:00.005 --> 06:01.442
What, are you
taking pictures, Phil?

06:01.542 --> 06:05.277
Are you kiddin'? This is
a Kodak moment. Now, smile.

06:06.387 --> 06:08.422
Oh, good.
Blind him with the flash.

06:08.522 --> 06:12.059
Phil, let the man keep
what's left of his dignity, please.

06:12.476 --> 06:15.562
- "Dignity." This is all your fault, Ed.
- My fault?

06:15.696 --> 06:18.506
Yeah. Cause you're a macho lunatic.
Phil and I are sheep.

06:18.606 --> 06:19.559
We're not sheep.

06:19.659 --> 06:22.055
We are sheep. We do
every stupid thing he asks!

06:22.155 --> 06:23.529
I didn't make you run.

06:23.777 --> 06:26.012
No, it was a 2,000-pound
rampaging animal

06:26.112 --> 06:28.158
spraying bull snot
all over Spain.

06:28.258 --> 06:30.537
That's what made me run.
You made me stand in front of it.

06:30.637 --> 06:33.248
Come on, guys.
Group shot.

06:33.740 --> 06:36.226
I got a big "I told you so"
coming from Barbara in this.

06:36.326 --> 06:37.965
Maybe she won't notice.

06:43.585 --> 06:45.668
Honey, want a pillow?
It's a long flight.

06:45.768 --> 06:47.658
No, thanks.

06:48.888 --> 06:51.738
Come on, it's not that bad.
I look like your mother.

06:54.644 --> 06:56.373
Here comes Mr Bull.

06:57.148 --> 06:59.651
Kim, baby, do you want
the aisle seat or the window seat?

06:59.751 --> 07:01.571
Cause whichever you want
makes me happy.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.606
I don't care.

07:02.706 --> 07:04.341
Good, then take the window.
I wanna talk to Mitch.

07:04.441 --> 07:05.441
Okay.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.244
- Be right back.
- Miss me.

07:08.784 --> 07:10.736
Admit it, pal.
You had fun.

07:10.836 --> 07:15.082
No. Scuba diving is fun.
I mean that's normal. People do that.

07:15.416 --> 07:18.322
Baseball fantasy camp,
until Phil threw up on Willie Mays,

07:18.422 --> 07:19.372
was fabulous.

07:19.472 --> 07:22.586
- I was nervous. He was my idol.
- Well, I'll never forget Willie's face.

07:22.686 --> 07:24.683
"Say, hey,
that's lunch on me."

07:26.412 --> 07:29.958
- Phil. I'm standing.
- Yes, dear.

07:30.639 --> 07:32.726
Can't wait to get out
of this country.

07:33.025 --> 07:34.360
You know,
maybe it's just me,

07:34.836 --> 07:38.553
but I think our little adventures
lately are becoming... stupid.

07:38.653 --> 07:41.795
You know?
What did you call them?

07:41.904 --> 07:43.823
"Desperate attempt
to cling to your youth"?

07:43.923 --> 07:44.882
Yeah, that.

07:44.982 --> 07:47.691
- That's bullshit.
- Bullshit? Ed, have you noticed

07:47.791 --> 07:49.858
the older you get,
the younger your girlfriends get?

07:49.958 --> 07:51.969
Soon, you'll be dating sperm.

07:52.954 --> 07:56.291
- I'm back.
- Okay. I've just one more thing to say.

07:57.626 --> 07:59.760
- Target parachute jumping.
- Ed!

07:59.860 --> 08:03.582
Now, it's a smaller parachute,
but you're traveling twice as fast.

08:03.682 --> 08:06.933
Great! When they find your body,
they can bury it in a sucrets box.

08:07.427 --> 08:09.790
- Phil said he'd go.
- Phil wants to die.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.913
I mean, if you were married
to that, you'd wanna die too.

08:13.013 --> 08:14.607
Look at 'im.
He's pretending to be asleep

08:14.707 --> 08:16.211
so he doesn't have
to talk to her.

08:16.311 --> 08:18.522
It's a couple of little jumps
from a plane.

08:18.622 --> 08:20.823
And then what?
We go on safari,

08:20.923 --> 08:23.259
only the animals have guns
and they hunt us?

08:23.359 --> 08:26.033
- Forget about it.
- It's never enough for you, Ed.

08:26.364 --> 08:29.534
- I'm reading.
- When's it ever gonna be enough?

08:44.424 --> 08:45.583
Hi, mom.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.044
<i>It's September 8th, 1952.</i>

08:52.765 --> 08:56.089
<i>We're driving back from
your aunt Marsha. My water breaks.</i>

08:56.189 --> 08:59.723
<i>Your father jumps the divider
of the sawmill River parkway</i>

08:59.823 --> 09:02.628
<i>and races me
to Doctors' Hospital and...</i>

09:05.279 --> 09:08.345
<i>at 5.16, out you came.</i>

09:08.782 --> 09:09.884
<i>Ohh...</i>

09:10.284 --> 09:13.044
<i>Happy birthday,
darling.</i>

09:14.788 --> 09:17.994
<i>- Here's your father.
- Hello, boy. Happy birthday.</i>

09:18.094 --> 09:21.560
- Hi, dad, how are you?
- I'm losing feeling in my left leg.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.926
<i>- Here's your mother.
- Don't worry. He's fine.</i>

09:24.798 --> 09:27.741
<i>So, what are you gonna
do now, birthday boy?</i>

09:28.195 --> 09:31.714
Well, I thought I'd lie here another three
and a half hours, and then go to work.

09:31.814 --> 09:34.687
<i>- Is Barbara with you?
- No, she's working the streets.</i>

09:34.787 --> 09:37.963
She likes to have breakfast with
her pimp. She should be in around 7.30.

09:38.063 --> 09:41.361
- Hi, mom.
- Give my boy a kiss.

09:43.641 --> 09:48.058
<i>I can't believe
my baby's 39 years old.</i>

09:50.573 --> 09:51.648
Bye, mom.

09:51.826 --> 09:56.741
<i>Oh... bye.
Angel, birthday boy.</i>

09:58.584 --> 10:00.303
Happy birthday.

10:11.472 --> 10:13.558
Well, at least
she said my age in years.

10:13.658 --> 10:16.224
Usually, she uses months,
like I'm still an infant.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.758
"How's Mitch?"
"Oh, good. He's 468 months today."

10:20.981 --> 10:21.981
Wow.

10:23.021 --> 10:26.481
I look a year older, hm?
Do I look a year older to you?

10:26.581 --> 10:30.827
Honey, at 5.15,
everybody looks a year older.

10:30.927 --> 10:33.390
- Do you know what I found yesterday?
- Hm?

10:33.490 --> 10:35.655
- Hair in my ear.
- Mitch.

10:35.755 --> 10:37.095
I'm losing hair
where I want hair,

10:37.195 --> 10:39.116
and getting one
where it shouldn't be hair.

10:39.709 --> 10:43.254
I found four big fat ones on my back.
I'm startin' to look like the fly.

10:43.421 --> 10:47.185
That's it. I'm canceling
your birthday party.

10:47.486 --> 10:50.587
- Why?
- Cause your birthdays depress you.

10:50.687 --> 10:52.614
- No, they don't.
- Oh, Mitch.

10:52.714 --> 10:55.634
On your 30th birthday,
you said you couldn't see.

10:55.734 --> 10:59.045
And then, on your 34th birthday,
you forgot my name for an hour.

10:59.145 --> 11:02.079
And last year, when I asked you
what you wanted,

11:02.357 --> 11:04.652
you said a CAT scan.

11:04.752 --> 11:08.396
- I had a headache.
- This year, let's just let it pass.

11:08.496 --> 11:11.503
- I wanna see my friends.
- All right.

11:11.603 --> 11:13.331
But I don't want
people coming over here

11:13.431 --> 11:15.454
thinking they're
in a Bergman film.

11:15.579 --> 11:17.703
"You've met
my husband, Mr. Death?"

11:18.946 --> 11:21.014
- I'll be good.
- Yeah?

11:21.293 --> 11:24.341
Cause I don't need you
any worse than you've been.

11:25.576 --> 11:28.026
- Wait a second. What does that mean?
- Nothing.

11:29.153 --> 11:31.921
"Nothing." Great.

12:29.405 --> 12:31.073
Got a minute?

12:33.367 --> 12:36.323
Hi. Only if a few minutes. I have
career day at Danny's school, so, I-I...

12:36.423 --> 12:38.639
Yeah, it'll just
take a second.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.423
What is it?

12:43.523 --> 12:45.004
/* Pizza Guy, Pizza Guy

12:52.470 --> 12:54.097
- So?
- So.

12:55.098 --> 12:58.519
So, it's stupid.
It's annoying.

12:58.619 --> 13:02.563
- It makes people change the station.
- I didn't write it.

13:02.814 --> 13:06.254
But you bought it. You put it on the air
three times a night during drive time.

13:06.354 --> 13:08.362
People are having accidents.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.391
You used to go out
and get advertising.

13:19.748 --> 13:21.971
You hustled.
You were creative.

13:22.071 --> 13:24.202
Something bad came in,
you fixed it.

13:24.302 --> 13:26.546
You rewrote it.
You worked with it.

13:26.756 --> 13:31.083
My God, we used to make fun
of guys who bought crap like this.

13:32.136 --> 13:34.093
What's going on with you?

13:35.848 --> 13:39.302
Did you ever reach a point in
your life... where you say to yourself

13:39.402 --> 13:43.306
"This is the best I'm ever gonna
look, the best I'm ever gonna feel,

13:43.406 --> 13:46.859
the best I'm ever gonna do,
and it ain't that great"?

13:47.860 --> 13:51.231
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

13:53.407 --> 13:55.785
Look, uh,
I'm the station manager.

13:55.993 --> 14:00.706
I'm... responsible... for the quality
of work here at the station,

14:00.998 --> 14:02.901
so, till further notice,
I have to insist

14:03.001 --> 14:05.074
on personally approving
all the new spots.

14:05.174 --> 14:08.293
What? I can't make a deal
without checking with you first?

14:08.632 --> 14:10.936
Just till you
get back on track.

14:13.572 --> 14:15.959
So, we're doin' this job
on 60th and 3rd,

14:16.059 --> 14:18.623
big friggin' ballbreaker
of a job, right?

14:18.723 --> 14:20.304
And we got the area
roped off, you know,

14:20.404 --> 14:22.110
so that some schmuck
don't walk through there

14:22.210 --> 14:24.345
and take a wreckin' ball
between the eyes.

14:25.421 --> 14:29.192
All of a sudden, this woman,
you know, with the big, dark glasses,

14:29.292 --> 14:32.850
the Bloomingdale bags, she starts
walkin' right through the ropes.

14:32.950 --> 14:37.050
I yelled down at her "Hey, you
can't go there, you stupid bitch!"

14:37.488 --> 14:40.893
And suddenly, this
big steam fitting bursts

14:40.993 --> 14:45.485
and this enormous goddamn crane
crashes right down on her legs,

14:45.814 --> 14:49.385
and she's screaming
"My legs! My legs!"

14:49.485 --> 14:53.999
And I say "No shit, your legs. You got
a 2,000-pound goddamn crane on 'em."

14:55.638 --> 14:58.253
Now, do you know how,
in an emergency,

14:58.353 --> 15:01.038
you can get like
superhuman strength? Huh?

15:01.138 --> 15:04.105
I reach down
and I lift this crane

15:04.355 --> 15:07.308
and Ernesto's able
to slide her out from under,

15:07.408 --> 15:09.887
and the doctors were
able to save her legs!

15:09.987 --> 15:13.906
So the moral is... don't walk
where you're not supposed to walk

15:14.045 --> 15:15.639
because there may
not be somebody

15:15.739 --> 15:18.232
with superhuman strength
to save your little ass.

15:20.038 --> 15:24.682
And don't do drugs.
That's it.

15:30.341 --> 15:34.976
Thank you, Mr. Morelli.
That was... very descriptive.

15:35.846 --> 15:39.201
Daniel, would you introduce
your father, please,

15:39.301 --> 15:41.055
and tell us what he does?

15:44.813 --> 15:47.172
My dad's named Mitch
and he's...

15:47.316 --> 15:49.369
he's a submarine commander.

15:50.331 --> 15:51.531
Danny.

15:53.906 --> 15:56.919
He works
for WBLM radio.

16:09.297 --> 16:13.719
Well, like, uh, Danny said,
I work for WBLM radio.

16:13.819 --> 16:17.050
- Are you a disc jockey?
- No, I'm not a disc jockey.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.887
You know the commercials
that are on the radio?

16:21.468 --> 16:23.608
Do you make
all those commercials?

16:24.479 --> 16:28.050
No. Other people
make the commercials.

16:28.150 --> 16:32.410
I sell them time, on our station,
for the commercials to be on.

16:32.510 --> 16:35.657
So, you decide which
commercials to use and when.

16:36.449 --> 16:40.404
That's right. Well, no, it's
not right. It used to be right.

16:40.870 --> 16:43.373
Seems now that I even have
to... check with the station manager

16:43.473 --> 16:45.326
if I wanna wipe my nose.

16:48.194 --> 16:51.010
The minute he took away
my authority, I shoulda quit.

16:59.849 --> 17:03.412
- Mr. Robbins?
- What?

17:07.064 --> 17:09.473
Value this time
in your life, kids.

17:09.573 --> 17:12.714
This is the time in your life
when you still have your choices.

17:12.859 --> 17:14.792
It goes by so fast.

17:15.071 --> 17:18.624
When you're a teenager, you think
you can do anything, and you do.

17:18.723 --> 17:23.367
Your 20s are a blur. 30s, you raise
your family, you make a little money,

17:23.623 --> 17:26.827
you think to yourself
"What happened to my 20s?"

17:26.953 --> 17:30.737
40s, you grow a little pot belly,
you grow another chin.

17:30.837 --> 17:32.837
The music starts
to get too loud.

17:32.937 --> 17:35.874
One of your old girlfriends from
high school becomes a grandmother.

17:36.136 --> 17:37.956
50s, you have
a minor surgery.

17:38.056 --> 17:41.235
You'll call it a "procedure",
but it's a surgery.

17:41.475 --> 17:44.357
60s, you'll have a major surgery.
The music is still loud,

17:44.457 --> 17:46.757
but it doesn't matter because
you can't hear it anyway.

17:46.981 --> 17:50.450
70s, you and the wife
retire to Fort Lauderdale.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.812
Start eating dinner
at two o'clock in the afternoon,

17:53.912 --> 17:56.408
have lunch around ten,
breakfast the night before...

17:56.508 --> 17:58.825
You spend most of your time
wandering around malls,

17:58.925 --> 18:00.655
looking for
the ultimate soft yoghurt

18:00.755 --> 18:02.457
and muttering
"How come the kids don't call?"

18:02.557 --> 18:03.893
"How come the kids don't call?"

18:04.332 --> 18:06.089
The 80s, you'll have
a major stroke.

18:06.931 --> 18:08.866
You end up babbling
to some Jamaican nurse

18:08.966 --> 18:11.647
your wife can't stand
but who you call "momma".

18:11.747 --> 18:13.662
Any questions?

18:16.302 --> 18:19.191
Danny was embarrassed
to tell the class what my job is.

18:19.291 --> 18:22.158
They're nine!
They get excited about the guy

18:22.258 --> 18:24.598
who gives them change
at the arcade.

18:25.645 --> 18:29.888
You just happen to have one
of those jobs that's difficult to...

18:30.066 --> 18:33.635
...believe that a grown man
does without losing his mind.

18:34.654 --> 18:38.246
Well, what is my job? I mean,
I sell advertising time on the radio.

18:38.346 --> 18:40.635
So, basically,
I sell air.

18:40.735 --> 18:42.208
At least my father
was an upholsterer.

18:42.308 --> 18:45.109
He made a sofa, a coach
you can sit on. Something tangible.

18:45.209 --> 18:49.624
What can I point to?
Where's my work? It's air. I sell air.

18:49.724 --> 18:52.916
Well, so, so, what are you saying?
You wanna quit?

18:53.173 --> 18:55.902
How can I quit?
I'm trapped.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.002
You're trapped?

18:57.308 --> 18:59.964
Yeah. The other day,
you said you wanna send Holly

19:00.064 --> 19:02.247
- to a performing arts school.
- Well, she's got talent.

19:02.347 --> 19:05.469
Talent... She was in one play,
and she fell off the stage.

19:05.569 --> 19:08.973
That's not talent, that's gravity.
And that school costs money.

19:09.073 --> 19:11.111
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.072
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping at Gwen's, down the hall.

19:14.172 --> 19:16.461
Again?
Are you paying rent there?

19:17.698 --> 19:20.034
- Dad.
- We're having a birthday party.

19:20.134 --> 19:22.297
I don't wanna sit around
with your friends.

19:22.397 --> 19:23.805
I told her
it'd be all right.

19:23.905 --> 19:25.981
We'll have
a family party tomorrow.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.170
- Bye, dad.
- Bye.

19:32.270 --> 19:34.334
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.247
Wait, let me show you
how I pop my shoulder.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.077
Danny. Dan.
Come on. Come on.

19:46.177 --> 19:48.375
He's in the gifted program
at school.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.104
Come on,
go to sleep, huh?

19:51.066 --> 19:53.891
Kim, you poor thing. What
has married life done to you?

19:53.991 --> 19:55.283
I mean,
you look like hell!

19:55.570 --> 19:59.147
Six months. Admit it. You didn't think
Ed would ever get married.

19:59.247 --> 20:00.407
Well, he met
the right woman.

20:00.595 --> 20:02.235
And how often
are you meeting that woman?

20:02.372 --> 20:04.256
You're lucky
it's your birthday, pal.

20:05.581 --> 20:07.851
Excuse me, I see one
of the guests is stealing.

20:10.586 --> 20:14.231
Your husband is so cute.
You must laugh all day.

20:14.331 --> 20:16.564
Yeah.
My sides hurt.

20:16.664 --> 20:19.860
We saw a picture of you
in a newspaper in your underwear.

20:20.054 --> 20:24.171
Oh, that was an advertisement.
I sometimes model ladies' underwear.

20:24.271 --> 20:26.537
- You looked great.
- Mom...

20:26.637 --> 20:29.827
You said "Let's see how
she looks after having two kids."

20:32.711 --> 20:34.961
Daniel,
time to go to bed.

20:35.111 --> 20:37.038
We'll wake you
for your wedding.

20:39.829 --> 20:42.849
Phil. Psst. Hello.

20:43.745 --> 20:46.160
You're pretending to sleep
at my birthday party.

20:46.260 --> 20:48.023
She around?

20:50.836 --> 20:52.531
She's in the kitchen.

20:54.364 --> 20:56.878
This is quite a life
you've carved out for yourself, Phil.

20:56.978 --> 21:00.479
Phil! Phil!
We're leaving.

21:00.846 --> 21:04.545
We haven't had cake.
He hasn't even opened his presents yet.

21:04.645 --> 21:08.966
Phil, you have to open the store
at 4.30. Daddy's counting on you.

21:09.126 --> 21:11.189
15 more minutes?

21:15.486 --> 21:17.155
Starting now.

21:24.912 --> 21:26.873
4.30 in the morning?

21:27.030 --> 21:28.847
Hey, you know,
you manage a supermarket,

21:28.947 --> 21:30.374
that's when the food arrives.

21:30.474 --> 21:32.757
Don't you have an assistant
or a kid or somethin'?

21:32.857 --> 21:35.155
Arlene's father
likes me to do it.

21:35.775 --> 21:39.443
"No free rides, Philly boy.
No free rides."

21:40.108 --> 21:42.584
I'm tellin' you,
they got me by the balls.

21:42.684 --> 21:44.897
She's got one,
he's got the other.

21:47.268 --> 21:49.123
Do you ever think
about quitting?

21:49.562 --> 21:51.107
Yeah, sure. Right.

21:51.246 --> 21:52.324
That's just
what I wanna do.

21:52.424 --> 21:54.627
Start over,
with two kids to take care of?

21:56.324 --> 22:00.287
No. At this age,
where you are... you are.

22:01.742 --> 22:05.492
- Hey, look who's awake.
- Look, I have got 14 minutes, okay?

22:05.592 --> 22:07.412
- So, can we give him the present?
- Yeah.

22:07.664 --> 22:08.772
What you get me?

22:10.084 --> 22:15.214
Two weeks. The three of us.
New Mexico. Driving cattle.

22:15.589 --> 22:18.550
- What? Like in a truck?
- No, no! Cowboys.

22:18.759 --> 22:20.981
It's a real old-fashioned
cattle drive.

22:21.081 --> 22:23.844
We drive the herd
from New Mexico to Colorado.

22:23.944 --> 22:24.917
You can do this?

22:25.017 --> 22:27.638
We ride, we roll,
we sleep out under the stars.

22:27.738 --> 22:30.684
- Show 'im the brochure.
- It's fantastic, Mitch.

22:32.314 --> 22:34.311
It's the newest thing.
People do this! It's great!

22:34.411 --> 22:36.450
Wow. Look at this.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.439
- Real horses!
- Does look good.

22:39.539 --> 22:42.901
"Good"? It's great. Cowboys.
It's what you always wanted to be.

22:43.001 --> 22:46.246
- Remember Mitchy the Kid?
- Right! Mitchy the Kid!

22:46.436 --> 22:48.373
And it's right when
your vacation comes.

22:48.473 --> 22:50.251
We've been planning it
for weeks.

22:51.745 --> 22:52.935
I can't do it.

22:55.311 --> 22:56.259
Why?

22:56.359 --> 22:58.756
We're going to Florida
to visit Barbara's parents.

22:58.856 --> 23:03.839
- What, are you sick?
- No, it's planned already. I-I promised.

23:03.939 --> 23:06.129
I worked every weekend
for a year to get this.

23:06.403 --> 23:08.241
What's with you
these days?

23:08.342 --> 23:10.385
Nothing.
You know, nothing.

23:11.813 --> 23:14.977
It's just, I... You know,
I don't wanna disappoint Barbara.

23:16.902 --> 23:20.740
Who is that? I know nine people
and they're all here. Excuse me.

23:24.952 --> 23:27.663
- Hi.
- Um, is Mr. Phil Berquist here?

23:28.456 --> 23:30.750
Can I get you
something...

23:31.167 --> 23:34.161
Mr. Berquist, your housekeeper
told me where you were. I'm in trouble.

23:34.261 --> 23:35.599
Oh, what-what are you
doing here, Nancy?

23:35.699 --> 23:36.779
Who-who's on register nine?

23:36.879 --> 23:38.529
- I don't know what to do.
- Rumaki?

23:38.629 --> 23:40.973
I don't think this is the time
or the place to talk about this.

23:41.073 --> 23:41.926
I'm late.

23:42.026 --> 23:44.341
- What?
- I missed my period.

23:44.441 --> 23:45.360
Oops!

23:45.460 --> 23:47.383
- What?
- I was at work and on my break

23:47.483 --> 23:50.394
and I took one of those home
pregnancy tests from aisle 11.

23:50.494 --> 23:54.558
- The ones on special?
- Yes! And it came out blue.

23:54.691 --> 23:57.632
Why is she
telling you this... Phil?

23:59.002 --> 24:01.170
Because I'm-I'm-I'm her boss

24:01.281 --> 24:04.218
and-and...
we-we have a health plan.

24:04.318 --> 24:07.988
Son of a bitch! You screwed
this little girl in my father's store?

24:08.088 --> 24:10.624
- Oh, no, no!
- It was in his car!

24:11.375 --> 24:12.617
Oh, Jesus!

24:12.717 --> 24:15.212
And I'm not a little girl.
I'm 20.

24:15.504 --> 24:18.298
Get out of this house,
you little whore.

24:18.431 --> 24:22.052
Hey! I will not permit you
to talk to her that way.

24:25.959 --> 24:26.959
Fine.

24:28.599 --> 24:33.076
- I'll tell my father what you did.
- No! Do not call Mr. Levine.

24:33.356 --> 24:35.396
Hey! Put down that phone!
Put it down!

24:35.496 --> 24:36.846
No! No!

24:37.616 --> 24:39.184
- That's my phone!
- You're crazy!

24:39.284 --> 24:43.102
That's right. Not having sex
for 12 years will do that to a person!

24:43.202 --> 24:45.809
Come on, you two stop it.
Come on, not in front of your friends.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.237
I'm not afraid of you!

24:51.249 --> 24:52.907
I'll call
from the bedroom!

24:53.007 --> 24:54.741
The bedroom? How the hell
would you know

24:54.841 --> 24:55.803
where the bedroom is?

24:55.903 --> 24:58.456
- I'm calling!
- Go ahead. I'm sure he's home.

24:58.556 --> 25:01.459
It's his night to meet with
the other escaped Nazis.

25:01.559 --> 25:04.011
- I hate you!
- I hate you more!

25:05.012 --> 25:07.557
If hate were people,
I'd be China!

25:15.441 --> 25:17.609
Let's bring out the cake.

25:24.074 --> 25:25.659
Good party.

25:27.911 --> 25:29.111
Mitch.

25:29.913 --> 25:33.917
Is that what you've been trying
to tell me? That you feel like Phil?

25:35.419 --> 25:37.017
- Like Phil?
- Yeah, am I gonna be

25:37.117 --> 25:39.877
sittin' here some night
and some... checkout girl

25:39.977 --> 25:43.865
- comes here looking for you?
- No, no, of course not.

25:44.053 --> 25:46.388
I know
you're not happy here.

25:47.765 --> 25:50.894
You're not happy at work.
I know how men think.

25:51.269 --> 25:55.231
"I'm not happy here. I'm not
happy there. I'll be happy... here."

25:56.358 --> 25:58.735
No.
You make me happy... here.

25:59.361 --> 26:00.361
No.

26:01.279 --> 26:04.991
- No, I make you feel trapped.
- No, you don't. It's not you.

26:05.367 --> 26:08.820
Well, how do you think that makes me
feel when I hear you say that?

26:08.920 --> 26:12.791
I didn't mean you.
It's me.

26:14.209 --> 26:18.129
I... I just feel lost.

26:23.093 --> 26:27.005
Kim was telling me
about this cattle drive thing.

26:27.105 --> 26:28.106
Oh.

26:28.724 --> 26:32.561
- Maybe you should go.
- What about Florida?

26:33.020 --> 26:36.140
You'll be miserable in Florida.
You'll make me miserable.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.643
- You hate my parents.
- I don't hate your parents.

26:38.743 --> 26:40.607
Come on, Mitch,
you have known my father

26:40.707 --> 26:41.948
since you were 18 years old

26:42.048 --> 26:44.171
and you've never
called him by his name.

26:44.740 --> 26:46.575
What is his name?

26:46.951 --> 26:49.370
It's a joke.
I was just joking.

26:49.870 --> 26:52.802
Look, I said I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna go.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.940
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.088
I'm not saying it's all right
if you don't wanna come with us.

27:00.381 --> 27:03.008
I'm saying
I don't want you to come.

27:07.472 --> 27:12.436
Go away with Ed.
Take Phil.

27:12.644 --> 27:17.107
I am giving you
these two weeks. It's my present.

27:18.483 --> 27:20.569
Go and find your smile.

27:23.780 --> 27:25.574
What if I can't?

27:28.326 --> 27:31.413
We'll jump off that bridge
when we come to it.

28:16.125 --> 28:17.794
My ass hurts
just watching this.

28:18.227 --> 28:21.033
Are you kidding?
This is fantastic!

28:23.549 --> 28:27.171
- I wonder if I could do that to Arlene?
- Phil, forget about it already.

28:27.271 --> 28:29.848
I could do it.
You've seen her ears.

28:31.725 --> 28:34.678
- They must be the other guests.
- I wish you hadn't worn this jacket.

28:34.778 --> 28:35.722
Why not?

28:35.822 --> 28:37.977
Why, look at this. It's got
your name and your picture on it.

28:38.077 --> 28:40.324
- It's a little grotesque.
- I'm proud of what I do.

28:40.424 --> 28:42.798
So's the president.
He doesn't wear his picture on a suit.

28:42.898 --> 28:44.714
Hi. You guys guests here?

28:44.814 --> 28:47.069
Yeah. We just got in, though.
I'm Mitch Robbins.

28:47.169 --> 28:49.876
- Ed Furillo. I sell sporting goods.
- Show him your jacket.

28:50.181 --> 28:52.246
Yeah, I'm Phil Berquist.

28:52.454 --> 28:55.624
I committed adultery.
Lost my job and my family.

28:56.834 --> 28:59.953
- His jacket's being made.
- Ha, ha, ha, yeah.

29:00.053 --> 29:03.094
I-I'm Ben Jessup and this
is my son, Steve Jessup.

29:03.590 --> 29:05.418
- Where you from?
- Baltimore.

29:05.518 --> 29:08.588
- We have a dental practice there.
- Really? You're both dentists?

29:08.688 --> 29:12.767
Yes. We're black and we're dentists.
Let's not make an issue out of it.

29:13.059 --> 29:16.155
Uh, they're not making an issue.
You're making an issue.

29:16.312 --> 29:18.398
- Hi.
- Hello.

29:19.315 --> 29:22.652
- Isn't this great?
- We're Ira and Barry Shalowitz.

29:22.819 --> 29:26.231
- Ira and Barry, that's like the ice cream.
- No, that's-that's us.

29:26.331 --> 29:29.993
- We make Ira and Barry's ice cream.
- Really? I love that ice cream.

29:30.452 --> 29:34.014
But on the commercials, it's-it's
a different Ira and Barry. It's two...

29:34.114 --> 29:36.917
- Good-looking guys.
- Models.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.050
If it was us,
could you eat?

29:41.588 --> 29:43.215
Who is that?

29:46.010 --> 29:50.429
Hi.
I'm Bonnie Rayburn.

29:52.349 --> 29:54.189
Actually, I was supposed
to meet somebody here

29:54.290 --> 29:57.188
but I got the message at the airport
that she's not coming and...

29:57.928 --> 30:00.723
I'm feeling really out of place.
I'm thinking of leaving.

30:00.823 --> 30:02.777
No, no, stay.

30:04.820 --> 30:07.980
You know, when I was alive,
I would have found her attractive.

30:10.565 --> 30:11.751
Howdy.

30:12.578 --> 30:15.510
I'm Clay Stone
and... this is my wife, Millie.

30:15.610 --> 30:16.873
- How do.
- Howdy.

30:16.973 --> 30:18.426
Welcome to the Stone ranch.

30:18.526 --> 30:21.137
Believe it or not,
that work you saw a while ago...

30:21.434 --> 30:23.741
y'all are gonna be doin' that
the next two weeks.

30:23.841 --> 30:25.191
Ya-hoo!

30:27.219 --> 30:29.368
- That's a good "yahoo", son.
- Thank you.

30:29.607 --> 30:33.216
Now, this ranch has been in my family
for five generations.

30:33.316 --> 30:36.703
And we've always tried to live out here
by the code of the Old West.

30:36.812 --> 30:38.732
If you came out here thinkin'
this is a dude ranch,

30:38.832 --> 30:39.985
I hate to disappoint you.

30:40.085 --> 30:44.153
This is not pretend.
This is a real working ranch.

30:44.444 --> 30:47.602
We've gotta move these animals
from here to our ranch in Colorado.

30:47.702 --> 30:48.673
This is gonna be great.

30:48.773 --> 30:51.502
You may feel like a bunch
of pigs on roller skates for a while,

30:52.035 --> 30:55.448
we're gonna be watchin' you.
We're gonna see how you sit a horse.

30:56.331 --> 30:58.655
And in a few days,
you'll be roundin' up a herd

30:58.755 --> 31:00.655
and goin' after strays.

31:00.919 --> 31:04.751
And you're gonna be in some country
that's just as pretty as heaven.

31:05.091 --> 31:08.242
Here's some of the folks you'll be
working with. This is TR and Jeff.

31:08.342 --> 31:09.640
They're both
professional cowboys.

31:09.740 --> 31:12.260
And our trail boss will be in
in a couple o' days.

31:12.432 --> 31:14.810
And this is the best dog-gone
Western chef goin'.

31:14.934 --> 31:18.214
Cookie! Hook up! Tell 'em
what they're gonna eat.

31:18.314 --> 31:22.308
You ain't gonna be gettin'
no nouveau almondine thin crust

31:22.408 --> 31:24.713
bottled water,
sauteed city food.

31:25.120 --> 31:28.368
Food's brown,
hot... and plenty of it.

31:28.906 --> 31:30.791
It's not that bad!
Hey, listen!

31:30.891 --> 31:34.753
We're gonna go to work
in the mornin'. And I mean work.

31:35.034 --> 31:38.875
You came out here city slickers.
You're gonna go home cowboys.

31:46.126 --> 31:47.140
What do you think?

31:47.240 --> 31:49.515
I think you look like
one of the "Village People".

32:18.100 --> 32:20.000
I'll take that shirt too.

32:25.682 --> 32:28.266
Excuse me. Here, boy.
Here, boy!

33:02.030 --> 33:04.397
You did it again!
Boy, you're gettin' great.

33:04.790 --> 33:07.188
See?
There's nothin' to it.

33:07.822 --> 33:11.234
Okay. Good.
You'll do it this time.

33:11.334 --> 33:13.396
It's wrist, wrist, wrist, go.

33:13.496 --> 33:15.848
- Okay.
- That's it. Wrist, wrist, wrist, go.

33:16.186 --> 33:19.641
- Will you stop kiddin' around?
- I'm not kiddin' around.

33:19.770 --> 33:21.382
I can't get this.
I'm not good with ropes.

33:21.482 --> 33:23.540
I can't even take the string
off a bakery box.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.021
- This time, run!
- Okay.

33:29.496 --> 33:30.896
Ya-hoo!

33:31.741 --> 33:32.741
Whoa!

33:33.325 --> 33:35.115
Everyone can do it but you.
It's embrrassing.

33:35.215 --> 33:36.431
It's not a competition, Ed.

33:36.531 --> 33:39.135
Everything's a competition.
Life's a competition.

33:39.235 --> 33:40.920
Come on, try it again.

33:42.419 --> 33:45.335
- How's it goin'?
- O-okay. Where have you been?

33:45.435 --> 33:48.633
Oh, I was... watching 'em
castrate a horse.

33:50.014 --> 33:52.182
Well, I'm hungry.
How 'bout you, hm?

33:52.846 --> 33:56.216
- Can I help you with that?
- No, thanks. I think I'm gettin' it.

33:58.049 --> 34:01.937
Are you?
Are you gettin' it?

34:02.037 --> 34:04.576
- See this? See what's goin' on?
- I'll take the big one.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.994
Wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
We are guests here.

34:07.094 --> 34:08.668
What, are you gonna
wrestle the cowboys?

34:08.768 --> 34:09.915
I'm not gonna do nothin'.

34:10.014 --> 34:12.127
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.
Let me handle this, okay?

34:12.226 --> 34:14.415
You know how you get.
It'll be High Noon.

34:15.577 --> 34:17.878
Come on.
Let me help you out.

34:18.289 --> 34:19.985
Look,
just leave me alone.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.170
I can't, you see.
I'm in love.

34:25.170 --> 34:26.844
Hi, boys.
How are you?

34:27.397 --> 34:31.127
You know, I was just ropin' over there.
Thought I'd... mosey on over.

34:31.226 --> 34:34.031
You know, I've never moseyed before.
Hope I did it correctly.

34:34.478 --> 34:37.629
I mean, I've walked, I've ambled.
I even sashayed once.

34:37.728 --> 34:39.742
But that was in front
of the draft board.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.600
Hello!

34:51.072 --> 34:52.072
Rough corral.

34:52.764 --> 34:55.165
- Bonnie, wanna... come rope with us?
- Naw, it's all right.

34:55.272 --> 34:57.431
I think that Bonnie's
talking with us, friend.

34:57.531 --> 34:58.589
She's fine right here.

34:58.689 --> 35:00.412
Guys, what are you doing, huh?

35:00.558 --> 35:03.763
This isn't exactly 90's behavior,
I gotta be honest with you.

35:07.541 --> 35:10.959
- You stepped on my foot.
- He did not, you horse's ass.

35:11.059 --> 35:13.140
- Ed.
- You want a piece o' this?

35:13.240 --> 35:16.298
- Any time, Zeke.
- How about right now, Stubby?

35:16.398 --> 35:17.398
Fine.

35:40.345 --> 35:42.168
This man owes you
an apology.

35:42.268 --> 35:44.244
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by that.

35:44.344 --> 35:48.073
- Not you. Him.
- Him. Of course.

35:51.760 --> 35:52.760
No.

35:56.765 --> 35:58.897
God, I'm sorry, ma'am.
That'll never happen again.

36:00.101 --> 36:01.652
Yes, see that it doesn't.

36:04.355 --> 36:06.075
I'm sorry, I thought
we were on the same...

36:06.858 --> 36:08.214
You're doin' fine.

36:12.447 --> 36:14.565
You guys were drinking.

36:18.604 --> 36:21.082
Don't let it happen again.

36:32.634 --> 36:33.834
Ma'am.

36:42.436 --> 36:44.451
Did you see that guy?

36:45.439 --> 36:48.734
That is the toughest man
I've ever seen in my life.

36:51.946 --> 36:55.909
Did you see how leathery he was?
He was like a saddlebag with eyes.

36:56.853 --> 37:01.552
Listen, it took a lot of courage
to do what you did. Thank you.

37:04.418 --> 37:06.044
I'm married.

37:16.388 --> 37:20.066
You're wrong, Ed. I'm tellin' you.
It was not a stupid thing to say.

37:20.166 --> 37:23.293
It was. She says "Thanks"
and you say "I'm married"?

37:23.395 --> 37:24.395
Yeah.

37:24.651 --> 37:27.830
I don't want
any... false flirtings.

37:27.930 --> 37:31.151
"False flirtings"?
What if you're like me?

37:31.612 --> 37:34.585
What if you don't encourage them
and they still come after you you?

37:34.685 --> 37:37.534
It doesn't happen. See,
women need a reason to have sex.

37:37.634 --> 37:39.442
Men just need a place.

37:40.458 --> 37:44.549
- Good night. I'm going to bed.
- Good night. Sleep tight.

37:47.587 --> 37:51.187
- That was flirting.
- No. That was politeness.

37:51.591 --> 37:53.563
That was "Have a pleasant
and restful evening."

37:53.663 --> 37:56.560
No. That was "I like your ass.
Could I wear it as a hat?"

37:57.637 --> 38:00.038
Say, uh...
Phil was tellin' us

38:00.138 --> 38:01.772
you had a little trouble
with Jeff and TR.

38:01.872 --> 38:03.507
Yeah, they were giving Bonnie
a hard time.

38:03.613 --> 38:05.098
Yeah, but he took care of it.

38:05.479 --> 38:08.252
What made it worse was
the trail boss comes over...

38:08.508 --> 38:09.518
Curly?

38:12.367 --> 38:15.212
His name is Curly?
Perfect.

38:15.312 --> 38:16.609
You know what
the cook said about 'im?

38:16.709 --> 38:18.767
Said he killed a man
in a knife fight.

38:19.495 --> 38:21.816
He said he slit him
from neck to nuts.

38:21.916 --> 38:23.772
I'm not happy about this.

38:24.495 --> 38:27.642
This guy's a cowboy.
One of the last real men.

38:27.742 --> 38:29.897
He's untamed.
A mustang.

38:29.997 --> 38:33.415
We're trained ponies. It'll do us
good to be in his world a while.

38:33.515 --> 38:35.953
"Do us good"?
He was hanging the help.

38:36.283 --> 38:37.617
He was helping us.

38:37.717 --> 38:39.565
This guy is not normal,
I'm tellin' you.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.928
Did you see his eyes?
He's got crazy eyes.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.584
He's a lunatic.
I'm tellin' you,

38:43.684 --> 38:47.074
we are going into the wilderness
being led by a lunatic.

38:47.174 --> 38:48.851
He's behind me,
isn't 'e?

38:51.861 --> 38:55.000
- Time to turn in.
- Good night.

39:04.624 --> 39:07.502
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by that.

39:07.627 --> 39:09.713
I crap bigger than you.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.792
He's gonna kill me.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.857
Watch it!
Excuse me. Whoo.

39:27.731 --> 39:30.425
- Whoa!
- Great! You are riding so much better.

39:30.693 --> 39:33.746
Thanks.
I-I just talked to, uh... Nancy.

39:33.846 --> 39:37.522
- Who's Nancy?
- She's the, uh... the girl.

39:37.622 --> 39:40.527
Oh, the, uh... the girl.

39:40.627 --> 39:43.229
- She's not pregnant.
- Really?

39:43.329 --> 39:46.925
- Well, that's good, isn't it?
- For her.

39:47.189 --> 39:48.972
What does it mean?

39:50.004 --> 39:53.604
You know what I think?
Out there are all the answers.

39:53.704 --> 39:56.812
No, Ed.
Out there...

40:00.970 --> 40:02.898
are cows,
and plenty of 'em.

40:03.031 --> 40:05.863
We're gonna go 200 miles
with a big, moving stink.

40:06.387 --> 40:07.387
Okay.

40:08.522 --> 40:10.732
You guys are probably
too young to remember this,

40:10.832 --> 40:14.935
but when I was a kid, I remember
seeing a movie called "Red River".

40:15.035 --> 40:18.357
- Oh, I've seen it on TV.
- But not in the movie theatre.

40:18.730 --> 40:22.606
The big screen, with John Wayne
and Montgomery Clift.

40:23.128 --> 40:25.866
You remember the scene,
it was the start of the cattle drive?

40:25.966 --> 40:28.869
- Dad...
- No, no, son. That's why we're here.

40:28.969 --> 40:31.788
- The "yee-ha" scene?
- The "yee-ha" scene.

40:31.888 --> 40:36.218
Before they took the cattle out, those
cowboys waved their hats in the air

40:36.843 --> 40:38.970
and yelled "Yee-ha!"

40:39.846 --> 40:44.016
- What do you say to that?
- All right! Move 'em out.

40:48.898 --> 40:50.858
- Yee-ha!
- Yee-ha!

40:51.526 --> 40:53.486
- Ya-hoo!
- Ya-hoo!

40:53.820 --> 40:54.979
Ya-hoo!

40:55.079 --> 40:56.079
Yee-ha.

40:57.690 --> 41:01.288
- Yee-haa!
- Yee-ha!

41:01.388 --> 41:03.082
- Yee-ha!
- Yee-ha!

41:03.182 --> 41:04.532
Yee-ha!

41:05.790 --> 41:08.350
- Feel like a schmuck?
- Oh, yeah. Big schmuck, yeah.

41:08.599 --> 41:10.199
Yee-haa!

41:11.863 --> 41:13.965
We'll see you
in Colorado.

42:24.162 --> 42:27.455
Hey, look, a stray.
You take 'im, Mitch.

42:27.624 --> 42:29.174
No, it's the first one.
You get him, Ed.

42:29.274 --> 42:31.115
No, no, it's the first one,
Let-let Phil have 'im.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.739
No, no, I'll get the next one. Look,
you get this one. I'll get the next one.

42:33.839 --> 42:34.821
You sure?
I mean, it's gonna be funny.

42:34.921 --> 42:36.590
No, no, you get this one.
I'll get the next one.

42:36.690 --> 42:37.603
Then Ed, then you...

42:37.703 --> 42:40.575
Like a round-around robin
kind of thing? That's good, yeah.

42:40.675 --> 42:42.176
- All right, so who gets this one?
- You.

42:42.276 --> 42:43.181
Oh, I?! Sure.

42:43.281 --> 42:45.391
- Come on. Go!
- Out of shoot N0.9!

42:45.491 --> 42:47.728
Hey! Go, Mitchy!

42:49.167 --> 42:52.072
No, no. No, no!
Don't go back there. No!

42:52.446 --> 42:54.651
Think I can't see you
behind there?

42:55.738 --> 42:56.928
Hello!

42:57.304 --> 42:59.871
Come on, now.
Here we go.

43:00.034 --> 43:02.541
Come on, now.
Here we go. Come on.

43:02.641 --> 43:04.758
It's like chasing a mime.

43:09.577 --> 43:11.711
Yee-ha, cowboy!

43:12.962 --> 43:15.113
- All right!
- All right, Mitchy! Ohh!

43:15.213 --> 43:17.735
I did it! All right!

43:18.357 --> 43:20.275
Uh-oh.
Hey, moonwalk!

43:22.427 --> 43:25.563
I'd like to thank everybody and God
for helping me get my stray in.

43:25.663 --> 43:27.233
Let's go, boy.

43:27.855 --> 43:30.929
All right, all right.
Come back. Come back. Come back.

43:31.029 --> 43:34.768
All right, now, easy on the clutch.
Cut the wheel! Cut it, cut it, cut it!

43:34.868 --> 43:39.022
That's it. Straight back
and park and lock it.

43:39.122 --> 43:40.835
You got the keys, sir?
How long you gonna be?

43:40.935 --> 43:43.444
Whoo! I wish
the kids coulda seen that.

43:44.723 --> 43:47.259
Then-then dump it into the personal,
and then make out the cheque.

43:47.359 --> 43:49.122
Why are we telling him this way?
He's our accountant.

43:49.222 --> 43:50.994
Why are we telling you this way?
You're our accountant.

43:51.094 --> 43:54.663
- No, don't... Just get a Mets score.
- Arnold, I'm losing you.

43:54.763 --> 43:56.752
We're going
behind a butte.

43:56.911 --> 43:59.317
Arnold?
Arnold, what's the Mets score?

43:59.417 --> 44:03.263
The Mets... I...
I lost 'im.

44:27.864 --> 44:30.110
Boy, that saddle's havin'
all the fun.

44:31.292 --> 44:33.281
You have, like,
half-track mind.

44:33.381 --> 44:34.974
You wouldn't like
to screw her brains out?

44:35.074 --> 44:36.367
Lovely image.

44:36.565 --> 44:39.069
It ranks right up there with
my other favourite of yours:

44:39.169 --> 44:40.596
"Bang the shit outta her."

44:42.043 --> 44:44.970
I'm sorry if I offended
your delicate sensibilities.

44:45.516 --> 44:47.492
I know that you was staring
at her pretty good.

44:47.620 --> 44:48.814
That's different.

44:48.923 --> 44:50.980
- Different?
- Yeah.

44:51.605 --> 44:55.247
Look. I go to an art gallery,
right? And I see a Picasso.

44:55.347 --> 44:58.659
- Oh, she's a Picasso now?
- No, she's not a Picasso.

44:58.783 --> 45:00.764
If she was a Picasso,
she'd have three tits.

45:00.864 --> 45:03.332
What I'm saying is,
if I see a nice painting,

45:03.432 --> 45:05.987
I look at it, but I don't pull it
off the wall.

45:06.087 --> 45:07.347
Let me ask you this.

45:08.092 --> 45:11.025
What if you could have great sex
with someone very attractive...

45:11.588 --> 45:13.739
and Barbara
would never find out?

45:13.961 --> 45:16.300
It's a big trap. I mean,
look what happened to Phil.

45:16.400 --> 45:19.299
The girl came to his house,
then she came to my house.

45:19.399 --> 45:20.400
Yeah.

45:22.387 --> 45:23.803
Let's say
a spaceship lands.

45:23.903 --> 45:26.101
Good, reality.
Are you listening to this?

45:26.201 --> 45:28.253
A spaceship lands
and the most beautiful woman

45:28.353 --> 45:29.909
you ever saw gets out.

45:30.270 --> 45:31.733
And all she wants to do

45:31.851 --> 45:34.518
is have the greatest sex
in the universe with you.

45:34.618 --> 45:35.598
Could happen.

45:35.698 --> 45:38.732
And the second it's over,
she flies away for eternity.

45:38.832 --> 45:42.571
No one will ever know.
You're telling me you wouldn't do it?

45:42.758 --> 45:45.084
No. It is just
what you describing

45:45.184 --> 45:46.678
actually happened
to my cousin Ronald.

45:46.778 --> 45:48.921
And his wife did find out
about it at the beauty parlor.

45:49.021 --> 45:51.170
- They know everything there.
- Forget about it.

45:51.288 --> 45:52.897
Come on, Ed,
what I'm saying is...

45:52.997 --> 45:55.237
it wouldn't make it all right
if-if Barbara didn't know.

45:58.256 --> 46:02.344
- Pay attention, girls. We got strays.
- Hi, Curly. Kill anyone today?

46:03.387 --> 46:04.867
Day ain't over yet.

46:12.188 --> 46:13.842
I wonder
what Barbara's doin'.

46:14.478 --> 46:17.782
You really with just one woman
for 15 years? Just one?

46:17.882 --> 46:22.058
Yes, Ed. I'm married. I caught my limit.
Why are you after me about this?

46:23.940 --> 46:26.785
Let's say...
all your life, for breakfast,

46:26.885 --> 46:28.898
you're eating from
the Kellogg's variety pack.

46:28.998 --> 46:30.149
And a spaceship lands.

46:30.249 --> 46:33.277
No. And then you don't get
the variety pack.

46:33.377 --> 46:37.190
You pick one, your favourite one,
and you just get that one from then on.

46:37.290 --> 46:40.340
Every day for the rest of your life,
the same cereal.

46:40.563 --> 46:44.373
And then you wake up one morning...
and you're just not hungry any more.

46:44.473 --> 46:46.235
You can't get an erection.

46:47.237 --> 46:50.469
Hey, pal! I can get an erection
any time I want. Watch.

46:50.569 --> 46:53.201
Ed, please, don't. Come on,
leave the stallion in the corral.

46:53.301 --> 46:55.042
You'll knock me
into the fire, okay?

46:58.360 --> 46:59.681
See, here's the thing.

47:00.436 --> 47:03.627
- Kim wants to have kids.
- And you don't?

47:04.225 --> 47:06.799
I tell 'er it's because
we wouldn't have as much fun.

47:06.899 --> 47:09.105
We heard a mile,
but that's not the reason.

47:09.955 --> 47:13.246
Having a kid, that's... heavy.
That's a real commitment.

47:13.346 --> 47:17.376
That's saying I'm... never gonna be with
another woman for the rest of my life.

47:17.922 --> 47:20.170
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

47:20.425 --> 47:23.125
I have no life.
We're all agreed on that, right?

47:23.225 --> 47:24.225
- Right.
- Right.

47:24.597 --> 47:27.772
Okay. And your big problem
is that you're married

47:27.872 --> 47:31.180
to this gorgeous
24-year-old underwear model,

47:31.280 --> 47:35.857
who thinks that the sun rises and sets in
your pants, and that's not enough for you?

47:36.315 --> 47:39.527
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.

47:40.017 --> 47:43.339
- I don't wanna screw around on Kim.
- So, don't.

47:43.507 --> 47:44.507
Oh.

47:45.324 --> 47:47.099
From the king of restraint.

47:47.618 --> 47:50.691
- What's that mean?
- It means that's pretty smug advice

47:50.791 --> 47:53.547
comin' from a man who mounted
an 18-year-old checkout girl

47:53.647 --> 47:55.102
on the day-old bread rack.

47:55.202 --> 47:58.381
- She's 20, and shut up.
- Let me get you hot, Phil.

47:58.693 --> 48:01.580
"I need a price, register nine.
I need a price"

48:01.680 --> 48:03.246
- Cut it out.
- Guys...

48:03.346 --> 48:05.806
What'd you use for protection?
Paper or plastic?

48:06.722 --> 48:08.756
- Come on! Come on!
- We're on vacation!

48:13.674 --> 48:17.000
- You're spookin' the cattle.
- We were just foolin' around.

48:17.100 --> 48:18.785
See you tomorrow.

48:21.820 --> 48:23.220
Sun up.

48:30.746 --> 48:31.740
- Morning.
- Hi.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.775
- You done with that?
- Yeah, help yourself.

48:35.067 --> 48:37.407
See, mom,
we're keepin' clean.

48:37.507 --> 48:41.387
It's cold... but I'm
a real pioneer man.

48:46.982 --> 48:48.932
- Morning.
- Good morning.

48:50.966 --> 48:54.461
Come on, guys.
You're sorry, you're sorry.

48:54.687 --> 48:56.235
Let's make up, huh?

49:02.695 --> 49:03.815
All right.

49:05.582 --> 49:07.960
- My fault.
- Naw, it's all right.

49:08.128 --> 49:12.497
Gotta celebrate. I got a special treat.
I'm gonna make fresh coffee.

49:12.622 --> 49:16.253
Battery-operated. Instantly grinds
its own beans. Only 19.95.

49:16.353 --> 49:19.010
- Come on, why live like animals?
- That's great.

49:19.110 --> 49:20.005
Yeah.

49:20.105 --> 49:21.884
All right. The first cup's gonna be
for my good friend Phil.

49:21.984 --> 49:24.546
When we were kids, he used to
let me watch his sister undress.

49:24.646 --> 49:27.968
I never forgot it, Phil...
cause I still do it. Okay.

49:36.104 --> 49:37.907
Wow. Something's
spookin' the cattle.

49:39.249 --> 49:41.861
Look, look, look.
The cows are going away.

49:46.316 --> 49:49.660
- Wow, look at 'em go.
- That is amazing.

49:49.869 --> 49:51.795
- Stampede!
- We gotta get 'em.

49:55.391 --> 49:56.361
Whoa!

49:56.461 --> 49:59.184
- Beautiful. Get that in the frame.
- Okay, I got it.

50:14.961 --> 50:17.139
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die. Oh, God!

50:17.239 --> 50:19.015
They're comin' at us!

50:28.725 --> 50:31.831
- Come on!
- Hold on, hold on, hold on!

50:42.429 --> 50:43.976
Bonnie,
there's a stampede...

50:44.767 --> 50:46.177
in your tent.

51:50.732 --> 51:52.380
City folk.

52:00.253 --> 52:05.731
I'm sorry. I mean, I was... just tryin'
to make a cup of coffee. That's all.

52:08.303 --> 52:10.680
It was...
it was French roast.

52:11.380 --> 52:12.919
There's still
a few head missin'.

52:13.019 --> 52:15.388
Must have gone into that canyon
while I was gettin' the others.

52:15.488 --> 52:17.652
- TR and I'll get 'em.
- No, I'll get 'em...

52:19.032 --> 52:20.578
with you.

52:21.915 --> 52:23.892
- Me?
- Yeah.

52:24.359 --> 52:27.527
- You're comin' with me.
- Just the two of us?

52:29.908 --> 52:33.005
You move the herd.
I'll catch up.

52:33.105 --> 52:36.276
- You mean, we'll catch up.
- Let's go.

52:48.302 --> 52:49.302
Bye.

52:51.840 --> 52:54.977
Curly, did I ever show you
pictures of my wife and kids?

52:56.266 --> 52:58.255
I'm their sole support,
you know.

52:58.355 --> 53:00.974
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Sure.

53:01.107 --> 53:03.049
Curly's just tryin' to scare 'im.
You know Mitch.

53:03.149 --> 53:04.741
He's a... he's a wise ass.

53:05.916 --> 53:07.719
If anything happens to him...

53:09.255 --> 53:11.097
I'm going after Barbara.

53:18.531 --> 53:21.893
Throw a rope on this 'un so we
can go after the others. Rope 'im.

53:21.993 --> 53:24.967
I-I'm not good at it.
I have a roping disability.

53:38.395 --> 53:40.252
Be right with you.

53:46.695 --> 53:48.364
Jesus Christ.

53:52.368 --> 53:54.829
Hey. See,
I'm good at this part.

53:55.701 --> 53:56.873
Throw it!

54:07.592 --> 54:10.461
You know what just occurred to me?
Roping is stupid.

54:10.561 --> 54:14.984
This is a cow, not a gazelle.
Watch. Get off the horse, huh?

54:17.852 --> 54:21.481
Then... you walk up to the cow.
Look how good this is working.

54:21.868 --> 54:24.985
Then you say "Hi, Bob Vila
for This Old Herd.

54:25.085 --> 54:26.608
We're gonna
rope you today."

54:26.708 --> 54:31.723
Then you take Mr. Loop and
put it around the head of... Mr. Cow.

54:35.924 --> 54:37.411
Now,
what's wrong with that?

54:42.500 --> 54:46.182
- That!
- I'm on vacation!

54:55.988 --> 54:58.837
- Is that it?
- That's it.

55:01.755 --> 55:04.534
- What are we doing?
- Making camp.

55:05.155 --> 55:07.549
Too late to catch up with the herd
before dark.

55:08.234 --> 55:09.965
We'll catch up tomorrow.

55:10.065 --> 55:14.142
You mean we're gonna...
sleep out here? Just, uh...

55:15.036 --> 55:16.217
That's right.

55:20.266 --> 55:22.252
Oh, God.
It's "Deliverance".

55:31.845 --> 55:33.976
Getting ready to shave?

55:34.556 --> 55:39.729
You make a lot of... smart remarks
at my expense, don't you?

55:40.741 --> 55:44.158
I'm joking.
I do with everybody.

55:44.899 --> 55:46.705
It's just my way.

55:47.671 --> 55:49.655
I don't understand
that way.

55:56.495 --> 55:58.205
Put that away.

56:03.944 --> 56:08.457
I said...
put that away.

56:09.842 --> 56:11.892
Hey, you know, the first time
I tried to talk to you,

56:11.992 --> 56:13.294
you embarrassed me.

56:13.846 --> 56:15.226
So, I teased you a little bit,

56:15.326 --> 56:18.283
which maybe I shouldn't
have done. So I'm sorry.

56:18.383 --> 56:19.576
But now you're sittin'
over there

56:19.676 --> 56:21.509
playin' with your knife,
tryin' to frighten me...

56:21.658 --> 56:23.706
which you're doin'
a good job...

56:25.644 --> 56:28.061
But if you're gonna kill me...
get on with it.

56:28.161 --> 56:30.741
If not,
shut the hell up.

56:32.289 --> 56:34.483
I'm on vacation.

57:45.357 --> 57:47.232
Do you know
any show tunes?

57:48.451 --> 57:51.040
And the second it's over,
she's gonna get back

57:51.140 --> 57:53.615
into her spaceship
and fly away for eternity.

57:53.945 --> 57:56.857
- Would you do it?
- Is she a redhead?

57:58.120 --> 57:59.621
Could be.

58:00.622 --> 58:02.416
I like redheads.

58:06.628 --> 58:09.047
- You ever been married?
- Naw.

58:11.633 --> 58:13.677
You ever been in love?

58:15.637 --> 58:16.920
Once...

58:18.140 --> 58:20.642
I was drivin' a herd
across the Panhandle.

58:21.024 --> 58:22.520
- Texas.
- Mm-hm.

58:24.272 --> 58:27.692
Passed near this little dirt farm
round about sundown.

58:29.277 --> 58:32.155
Out in the field was
this... young woman...

58:32.625 --> 58:34.532
workin' down in the dirt.

58:35.283 --> 58:38.536
Just about then,
she stood up to stretch her back.

58:41.289 --> 58:44.046
She was wearin'
a little cotton dress, and...

58:44.709 --> 58:47.084
the settin' sun
was right behind her...

58:47.796 --> 58:50.593
showing the shape
that God had give her.

58:51.851 --> 58:53.009
What happened?

58:54.868 --> 58:57.601
I just... turned around
and rode away.

58:58.226 --> 58:59.226
Why?

59:01.060 --> 59:04.300
I figured it wasn't gonna get
any better than that.

59:04.563 --> 59:07.817
Yeah, but you could've been,
you know... with her.

59:08.279 --> 59:09.985
I been with
lots of women.

59:10.217 --> 59:13.681
Yeah, but, you know, she could've
been the love of your life.

59:13.989 --> 59:15.389
She is.

59:16.992 --> 59:20.779
That's great.
That's... not great.

59:20.879 --> 59:22.023
No, that's wrong, Curly.

59:22.123 --> 59:24.621
You passed up something
that might have been terrific.

59:24.721 --> 59:27.718
- My choice.
- I never could have done that.

59:27.818 --> 59:29.630
That's your choice.

59:31.012 --> 59:35.981
A cowboy leads a different kind of life.
When there were cowboys.

59:36.907 --> 59:39.240
We're a dyin' breed.

59:41.658 --> 59:43.555
Still means
somethin' to me, though.

59:44.140 --> 59:48.010
In a couple o' days,
we'll move this herd across the river...

59:49.642 --> 59:51.349
drive 'em through the valley...

59:54.488 --> 59:57.042
There's nothin'
like bringin' in a herd.

59:57.409 --> 01:00:00.412
See, now that's great.
Your life makes sense to you.

01:00:02.859 --> 01:00:03.827
What's so funny?

01:00:03.927 --> 01:00:07.287
You city folk, you worry
about a lot of shit, Mitch.

01:00:07.387 --> 01:00:10.892
Shit? My wife basically told me
she doesn't want me around.

01:00:11.423 --> 01:00:13.001
Is she a redhead?

01:00:13.425 --> 01:00:16.082
- I'm-I'm just saying...
- How old are you?

01:00:16.428 --> 01:00:18.054
- 38.
- 39.

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.872
Y'all come up here about
the same age. Same problems.

01:00:22.088 --> 01:00:24.557
Spend about 50 weeks a year
gettin' knots in your rope

01:00:24.657 --> 01:00:28.608
and then.. then you think
two weeks up here'll untie 'em for ya.

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.290
None of you get it.

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:36.278
Do you know
what the secret of life is?

01:00:36.473 --> 01:00:37.782
No. What?

01:00:38.785 --> 01:00:41.252
- This.
- Your finger?

01:00:41.412 --> 01:00:44.681
One thing.
Just one thing.

01:00:45.764 --> 01:00:49.374
You stick to that and
everything else don't mean shit.

01:00:49.708 --> 01:00:53.072
That's great,
but... what's the one thing?

01:00:53.999 --> 01:00:56.595
That's what
you gotta figure out.

01:01:04.186 --> 01:01:06.582
Oh, damn it!
Come on!

01:01:14.057 --> 01:01:17.887
- What's the matter? What's goin' on?
- This cow's having a baby.

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:23.237
I noticed it
when we found her.

01:01:23.337 --> 01:01:27.042
I was hopin' she'd make it
through the drive, but... she's ready.

01:01:27.167 --> 01:01:29.161
Does she do it herself?
Or do you help her?

01:01:29.261 --> 01:01:32.047
I'll hold her down.
You deliver the calf.

01:01:32.619 --> 01:01:36.023
Excuse me? Hello?
Why don't I hold her down?

01:01:36.135 --> 01:01:40.173
You don't know how. She'll kick you
and kill you, and her and the calf.

01:01:40.273 --> 01:01:43.643
- That's too much for me to carry back.
- I see your point.

01:01:43.846 --> 01:01:45.716
Come on.
She's ready.

01:01:47.856 --> 01:01:49.766
- I...
- She's burstin'!

01:01:49.866 --> 01:01:51.764
Oh, God.
There's gonna be bursting?

01:01:52.235 --> 01:01:55.813
Just reach in
and pull out the calf.

01:02:09.669 --> 01:02:10.669
Ooh.

01:02:16.893 --> 01:02:18.568
You know, this was not
in the brochure.

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:20.856
She needs help,
goddamn it!

01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:28.377
What's taking so long?
Do you see the head?

01:02:31.233 --> 01:02:32.233
Ugh.

01:02:36.238 --> 01:02:38.741
- I only see a tail.
- Oh, shit.

01:02:39.124 --> 01:02:41.702
It's turned the wrong way.
Get it out.

01:02:43.412 --> 01:02:44.612
Uh-oh.

01:02:44.914 --> 01:02:46.699
- My watch came off.
- Now!

01:02:46.799 --> 01:02:49.794
- It was a gift!
- Do it!

01:02:51.754 --> 01:02:53.214
Come on.

01:03:11.608 --> 01:03:16.916
- Oh, Jesus.
- Look what I did! I made a cow.

01:03:19.616 --> 01:03:24.482
This is unbelievable.
This is amazing.

01:03:24.582 --> 01:03:26.238
He looks like you.

01:03:26.373 --> 01:03:28.583
Look at 'im.
Yeah. Get up.

01:03:31.695 --> 01:03:32.882
Oh, shit.

01:03:33.923 --> 01:03:37.175
Look. Look at this.
He's walking already.

01:03:37.275 --> 01:03:40.872
He's a genius. He gets that
from my side of the family.

01:03:40.972 --> 01:03:43.050
We all walk very early.

01:03:44.976 --> 01:03:48.354
I'm gonna name 'im Norman.
You know, cause years ago...

01:03:53.317 --> 01:03:56.355
- Why did you do that?
- She was dyin'.

01:03:58.716 --> 01:04:00.496
And she was sufferin'.

01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:03.870
We saved the calf.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.292
Good job, cowboy.

01:04:24.558 --> 01:04:27.732
There you go, Norman. That was it.
You are only down a quart.

01:04:27.832 --> 01:04:30.763
That's really wonderful.
You got 'im to drink from the bottle.

01:04:32.232 --> 01:04:35.659
Yeah, thank God,
cause my nipples were killing me.

01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:41.027
What do you think? What would be
the perfect flavor with this meal?

01:04:41.492 --> 01:04:43.444
- Cherry vanilla?
- No.

01:04:43.544 --> 01:04:47.754
If it was Chinese food, right on
the money, but this... toasted almonds.

01:04:51.168 --> 01:04:52.146
What's goin' on?

01:04:52.246 --> 01:04:54.330
Barry can pick out
the exact right flavor

01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:56.517
of ice cream
to follow any meal.

01:04:58.217 --> 01:05:00.964
Go ahead.
Challenge 'im.

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.824
- "Challenge 'im"?
- C'mon.

01:05:05.826 --> 01:05:07.310
Franks and beans.

01:05:07.477 --> 01:05:11.623
Scoop o' chocolate, scoop of vanilla.
Don't waste my time.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:23.317
Come on. Push me.

01:05:27.787 --> 01:05:30.011
- Sea bass.
- Grilled?

01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:33.394
- Sauteed.
- I'm with ya.

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.548
Potatoes au gratin.

01:05:39.009 --> 01:05:41.009
Asparagus.

01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:49.854
Rum raisin.

01:05:52.565 --> 01:05:53.565
Woof!

01:05:53.858 --> 01:05:56.569
Woof what?
How do you know he's right?

01:05:57.194 --> 01:06:01.295
How do we know?
1400 retail outlets across the country.

01:06:01.395 --> 01:06:02.829
That's how we know.

01:06:03.868 --> 01:06:04.868
Woof!

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:07.613
Will you stop
with Roberto Clemente?

01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:10.701
Henry Aaron was the greatest
right fielder of our generation.

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:13.337
Could he run like Clemente?
Could he flow like Clemente?

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:15.007
Look, I'm gonna
say one thing to you, okay?

01:06:15.107 --> 01:06:18.063
755 home runs.
Goodbye.

01:06:18.163 --> 01:06:20.007
Hey, Clemente was killed
in a plane crash.

01:06:20.107 --> 01:06:21.638
What, you're gonna
blame that on Aaron?

01:06:21.738 --> 01:06:23.502
No. I'm not blamin',
I'm just sayin'.

01:06:23.602 --> 01:06:26.600
- Oh, baseball.
- You got something against baseball?

01:06:27.273 --> 01:06:28.608
It's just I used to live
with a guy

01:06:28.708 --> 01:06:31.589
who was like a baseball encyclopaedia.
And I just got flashes.

01:06:31.772 --> 01:06:33.962
And you broke up with him
cause of baseball?

01:06:34.099 --> 01:06:36.242
Uh, no. We had different needs.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.552
I needed him
to treat me decently and get a job,

01:06:38.652 --> 01:06:41.398
and he needed to empty
my bank account and leave.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:42.498
Ouch.

01:06:43.867 --> 01:06:47.328
- So, do you hate baseball?
- No, I like baseball.

01:06:47.428 --> 01:06:51.622
I just never understood how you guys
can spend so much time discussing it.

01:06:51.722 --> 01:06:53.872
I mean, I've been to games,
but... I don't memorize

01:06:53.972 --> 01:06:57.754
who played third base
for Pittsburgh in... 1960.

01:06:57.854 --> 01:06:58.857
Don Hoak.

01:06:58.957 --> 01:07:02.565
- Beat you.
- See, that's exactly what I mean.

01:07:02.814 --> 01:07:06.799
So, what do you and your friends
talk about... out there?

01:07:07.202 --> 01:07:10.336
Well... real life.

01:07:10.436 --> 01:07:13.753
Relationships...
Are they working, are they not?

01:07:13.853 --> 01:07:15.733
Who's she seeing.
Is that working?

01:07:16.228 --> 01:07:19.519
- No contest. We win.
- Why?

01:07:19.784 --> 01:07:23.807
Honey, if that were
as interesting as baseball...

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.886
they'd have cards for it
and sell it with gum.

01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:32.248
Ed, I see by the sun
it's time for you to hibernate again.

01:07:33.127 --> 01:07:36.242
You're right, I suppose.
I-I mean, I guess it is childish,

01:07:36.342 --> 01:07:39.511
but, uh, when I was
about 18

01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:42.876
and my dad and I couldn't
communicate about anything at all...

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:46.715
we-we could still talk
about baseball.

01:07:47.516 --> 01:07:49.393
Now, that-that was real.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.839
You know
what the secret of life is?

01:07:57.151 --> 01:07:58.694
It's this.

01:08:00.631 --> 01:08:03.633
One thing.
Just one thing.

01:08:04.032 --> 01:08:07.250
- And what's that?
- I have no idea.

01:08:07.537 --> 01:08:09.854
But ask Curly
cause he seems to know.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.190
- Curly knows the secret of life?
- Yeah.

01:08:13.543 --> 01:08:14.640
I'm gonna invite him over.

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.591
I mean, he's
a very interesting guy, you'll see.

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:18.015
I'm sure he is.

01:08:24.763 --> 01:08:26.660
Hey, Curly.

01:08:27.348 --> 01:08:31.067
Curly?
Curl, you got a minute?

01:08:32.394 --> 01:08:35.555
He is a real cowboy.
He sleeps with his eyes open

01:08:35.656 --> 01:08:38.036
so he can still
watch the herd.

01:08:40.278 --> 01:08:42.678
Curl. Curly?

01:08:58.406 --> 01:08:59.577
Is this all right?

01:08:59.944 --> 01:09:03.273
Do you need, like, a licence
or something to bury somebody?

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:06.350
Nah. This is where
Curly'd wanna be buried.

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:09.772
He said he was a dying breed.
I didn't know he meant on this trip.

01:09:09.872 --> 01:09:13.813
The man ate bacon at every meal.
I mean, you can't do that.

01:09:13.912 --> 01:09:15.810
Well, I guess that's it.

01:09:16.255 --> 01:09:17.642
Wait-wait a minute.
Shouldn't somebody

01:09:17.742 --> 01:09:19.796
say something?
I mean, you know, like a eulogy?

01:09:19.895 --> 01:09:23.694
- Yeah.
- Cookie, you knew 'im best.

01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:33.210
Lord, we give you Curly.
Try not to piss him off.

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:35.281
That's it?

01:09:35.419 --> 01:09:37.783
What else is there?
I got chicken burnin'.

01:09:37.884 --> 01:09:41.335
You're a warm man, Cookie.
Wait a second. I'll...

01:09:45.457 --> 01:09:47.738
What can I say
about Curly?

01:09:47.839 --> 01:09:50.823
I didn't know you well,
but I'll never forget you.

01:09:51.227 --> 01:09:56.049
You lived life on your terms -
simple, honest and brave.

01:09:56.563 --> 01:09:59.226
I'm glad for this short time
that we spent together.

01:09:59.326 --> 01:10:01.219
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:02.319
Amen.

01:10:10.663 --> 01:10:13.280
Do you think this is all right?
I mean, with them?

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.508
All right, listen up.

01:10:14.927 --> 01:10:17.792
Ben, I want you to take
the left flank with TR and Bonnie.

01:10:17.892 --> 01:10:20.285
I want you three boys
to ride point.

01:10:20.385 --> 01:10:22.688
I'm gonna push
with Steve, Barry and Ira.

01:10:22.788 --> 01:10:25.219
Yeah, they're pros.
It'll be okay.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:51.997
So long, cowboy.

01:11:09.861 --> 01:11:11.556
You know, it makes you
stop and think.

01:11:11.656 --> 01:11:13.218
Stop the clock.

01:11:13.318 --> 01:11:15.819
- That's 25 minutes. I win.
- Yep.

01:11:15.919 --> 01:11:16.951
Win what?

01:11:17.051 --> 01:11:18.600
I had under
a half an hour

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.795
before you started
to talk about death.

01:11:21.119 --> 01:11:23.197
Why would you think
I would talk about death?

01:11:23.496 --> 01:11:25.415
What, are you kiddin'?
We just came from a funeral.

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:27.378
And it's your favourite subject.

01:11:27.478 --> 01:11:29.527
It is not. I-I just think
when you see a life end,

01:11:29.627 --> 01:11:32.930
it's a natural time to... think
about your own mortality.

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:35.505
No, it isn't.
Why do that to yourself?

01:11:35.605 --> 01:11:38.440
When somebody dies,
I don't change places with 'im.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.770
I appreciate the fact
that I'm not dead.

01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:44.570
Look at this. It's a beautiful day.
I'm here with my two best friends.

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:46.790
And we're driving a herd of cattle
across the plains.

01:11:46.895 --> 01:11:50.379
Pretty goddamn great.
It's one of the best days of my life.

01:11:50.767 --> 01:11:53.799
All right. What is
the best day of your life?

01:11:53.899 --> 01:11:55.001
You mean ever?

01:11:55.101 --> 01:11:57.293
Yeah. Best day ever
in your whole life.

01:11:57.439 --> 01:12:00.188
And you can't do when your kids
were born. That's too easy.

01:12:01.521 --> 01:12:02.717
I got one.

01:12:03.916 --> 01:12:06.986
I'm seven years old and
my dad takes me to Yankee Stadium.

01:12:07.086 --> 01:12:08.355
My first game.

01:12:09.131 --> 01:12:12.166
We're goin' in this long,
dark tunnel underneath the stands.

01:12:12.266 --> 01:12:16.743
I'm holding his hand and we come up
out of the tunnel into the light.

01:12:17.691 --> 01:12:22.769
It was huge. How green
the grass was. Brown the dirt.

01:12:23.007 --> 01:12:25.664
And that great green
copper roof. Remember?

01:12:26.135 --> 01:12:27.499
We had
a black-and-white TV,

01:12:27.599 --> 01:12:29.611
so this was the first game
I ever saw in colour.

01:12:31.045 --> 01:12:33.051
I sat the whole game
next to my dad.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.177
He taught me
how to keep score.

01:12:36.061 --> 01:12:37.807
Mickey hit one out.

01:12:38.564 --> 01:12:41.621
- Good day.
- I still have the program.

01:12:43.236 --> 01:12:46.331
All right, what was... what was
the worst day you ever had?

01:12:48.408 --> 01:12:51.841
Worst day. A couple o' years ago,
Barbara finds a lump.

01:12:51.941 --> 01:12:53.928
- What?
- Jesus!

01:12:54.028 --> 01:12:57.070
- Yeah, it scared the shit out of me.
- You never said anything.

01:12:57.170 --> 01:12:59.028
Yeah, well, you know,
it turned out to be nothing.

01:12:59.128 --> 01:13:01.337
But... that whole day was...

01:13:03.006 --> 01:13:05.375
- Yeah, but that was a good day.
- How?

01:13:05.475 --> 01:13:07.215
Because it turned out
to be nothing.

01:13:07.315 --> 01:13:10.472
Yeah, but the day
until then was horrible.

01:13:10.572 --> 01:13:12.494
Yeah, but it came out good.

01:13:12.768 --> 01:13:16.780
You're a real "the glass is half-empty"
kind of a guy, you know that?

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.796
I don't know
how Barbara can stand it.

01:13:18.896 --> 01:13:19.897
Yeah.

01:13:20.358 --> 01:13:22.810
All right. I got one.
My best day.

01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:25.492
Isn't the one about Arlene
and that loose step, is it?

01:13:25.592 --> 01:13:27.544
No.
No, my wedding day.

01:13:27.907 --> 01:13:30.446
- What?
- Yeah. Remember that day?

01:13:30.759 --> 01:13:36.680
Outdoor wedding. Arlene looked great.
Those water pills really worked.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:41.348
You guys are all smilin' at me.
And my dad, in the front...

01:13:42.438 --> 01:13:45.227
gives me a little wink...
you know?

01:13:45.731 --> 01:13:50.160
I mean, he's not the warmest
of men... but he-he winked.

01:13:50.382 --> 01:13:52.748
You know, I was the first
to get married and have a real job.

01:13:52.848 --> 01:13:55.393
I remember thinking
"I'm grown-up."

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:59.858
You know? "I'm... I-I-I'm not
a goofball any more. I made it."

01:14:01.275 --> 01:14:03.034
I felt like a man.

01:14:04.278 --> 01:14:06.518
It's the best day of my life.

01:14:07.448 --> 01:14:10.868
- What was your worst day?
- Every day since is a tie.

01:14:15.072 --> 01:14:18.361
All right, Ed. Your best day.
What is it, twins in a trapeze, what?

01:14:18.461 --> 01:14:20.619
- No, I don't wanna play.
- Why, we did it.

01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:22.236
I don't feel like it.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.880
Okay.

01:14:30.151 --> 01:14:32.973
I'm 14 and my mother and
father are fighting again.

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:36.143
You know, because she caught
'im again. Caught 'im!

01:14:36.527 --> 01:14:39.564
This time, the girl drove
by the house to pick 'im up.

01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:45.085
And I finally realized he wasn't
just cheatin' on my mother.

01:14:45.185 --> 01:14:46.898
He was cheatin' on us.

01:14:46.998 --> 01:14:52.327
So I told him. I said "You're bad
to us. We don't love you."

01:14:52.952 --> 01:14:55.039
"I'll take care of
my mother and my sister.

01:14:55.139 --> 01:14:56.570
We don't need you
anymore."

01:14:56.956 --> 01:15:00.270
And he made like he was gonna
hit me, but I didn't budge.

01:15:00.844 --> 01:15:04.822
Then he turned around and he left.
Never bothered us again.

01:15:05.548 --> 01:15:08.979
But I took care of my mother
and my sister from that day on.

01:15:09.079 --> 01:15:10.970
That's my best day.

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.307
What was your worst day?

01:15:14.891 --> 01:15:16.392
Same day.

01:15:21.963 --> 01:15:24.384
Danny Dejenny gets
the sign from Berra.

01:15:24.484 --> 01:15:26.245
He gets the sign from Berra.
The pitch!

01:15:26.345 --> 01:15:27.345
Whoa!

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.122
What's he doin'?

01:16:18.081 --> 01:16:19.657
Whoa, boy!

01:16:19.849 --> 01:16:22.249
- He's drunk, the old shithead.
- Where'd he get the liquor?

01:16:22.386 --> 01:16:24.330
How.... how
do I know that?

01:16:24.666 --> 01:16:26.971
Goddamn, we better
get him out of there.

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:32.564
Is that a happy face?

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:35.767
He's nuts.

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:43.516
- He's throwing our food.
- Well, we'll...

01:16:43.616 --> 01:16:45.902
We'll what?
We'll order out?!

01:16:55.009 --> 01:16:57.849
- He's headed for the ravine!
- I'm sure he sees it.

01:17:01.869 --> 01:17:02.869
Jump!

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:19.278
What can you say about
Skyrocket and Buttercup?

01:17:19.378 --> 01:17:21.052
Don't say anything.
Let's just get outta here.

01:17:21.152 --> 01:17:23.546
Wait. Let's just recap on
what we've buried so far on this trip.

01:17:23.678 --> 01:17:27.348
- Trail boss, two horses...
- I can't believe we buried horses.

01:17:27.448 --> 01:17:29.363
Well, the impact really
drove 'em into the ground.

01:17:29.463 --> 01:17:31.326
We just covered 'em up
with some dirt.

01:17:32.533 --> 01:17:34.396
How we gonna move
the food and the tents?

01:17:34.496 --> 01:17:35.832
Tents roll up.

01:17:35.932 --> 01:17:39.489
We can pack enough food
in our saddlebags to get us there.

01:17:39.589 --> 01:17:41.166
Okay. Let's do it.

01:17:41.998 --> 01:17:45.683
The problem's Cookie.
Let's no forget his legs are broken.

01:17:45.783 --> 01:17:48.059
Oh, God, they're gonna shoot him.
I know they're gonna shoot him.

01:17:48.159 --> 01:17:51.121
Now, we put Cookie on this litter
so we can get him outta here.

01:17:51.385 --> 01:17:54.681
Me and TR are gonna stay
with you all and the herd.

01:17:54.889 --> 01:17:57.773
We're gonna be hittin'
some pretty rough mountain country.

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:58.790
Ay!

01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:02.105
There's a town, it's about half a day's
ride outta here. I can draw a map.

01:18:03.319 --> 01:18:06.850
Somebody's gotta take
Cookie. Volunteers?

01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:16.207
- I guess Steve and I should go.
- Why?

01:18:16.307 --> 01:18:18.905
Because he's injured and
we have medical training.

01:18:19.005 --> 01:18:21.719
The devil, we're dentists! What
are we gonna do, give him a cleaning?

01:18:21.819 --> 01:18:24.482
We have a better chance
of helping him than anyone, son.

01:18:25.176 --> 01:18:28.142
- But you're having fun.
- Ride with me.

01:18:28.242 --> 01:18:31.367
It will still be fun. Huh?

01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:34.612
That's really great
of you, Ben, Steve.

01:18:34.712 --> 01:18:36.632
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks a lot, that's great.

01:18:36.761 --> 01:18:38.050
- Thanks, Ben.
- Good luck.

01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:41.440
- Thank you, Dr. Jessup.
- We would have gone, but...

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:44.439
Good.
I'll make up that map.

01:18:45.191 --> 01:18:48.144
Hey, look. I found where
Cookie was hidin' his whiskey.

01:18:48.244 --> 01:18:50.529
- You old coot.
- Hey, Jeff.

01:18:53.365 --> 01:18:55.072
Shouldn't we
do something?

01:18:55.172 --> 01:18:58.086
Let' em have their fun,
then they'll sleep it off.

01:19:00.384 --> 01:19:02.324
I knew it turned
we couldn't trust these guys.

01:19:02.424 --> 01:19:05.836
I said "tennis camp".
You said "let's drive cattle".

01:19:06.281 --> 01:19:08.508
Wait a minute.
I got an idea.

01:19:12.177 --> 01:19:14.387
- Look at this.
- Norman.

01:19:15.639 --> 01:19:18.642
- Norman.
- What are they doing with Norman?

01:19:19.339 --> 01:19:23.383
Mitchy! Mitchy,
come on out and play.

01:19:23.649 --> 01:19:26.104
- Don't go out there.
- What do you think, I'm nuts?

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:32.269
Mitch, do you like
calf brains?

01:19:33.907 --> 01:19:37.285
- This is over a cow.
- Here's your last chance.

01:19:37.882 --> 01:19:40.082
They're not gonna hurt me.
There's too many witnesses.

01:19:40.182 --> 01:19:41.958
Please, be careful.

01:19:42.058 --> 01:19:45.600
They're just gonna
embarrass me, so I'll let 'em.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:53.068
Norman, have you been
bothering the cowboys again?

01:19:53.471 --> 01:19:56.493
You know, you raise them, you try
to teach them right from wrong,

01:19:56.593 --> 01:19:58.342
but they learn these things
from their friends.

01:19:58.442 --> 01:19:59.811
I mean,
it's the school systems.

01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:07.369
You're grounded, mister.

01:20:09.026 --> 01:20:11.618
These cows today,
huh?

01:20:14.532 --> 01:20:16.659
You pansy-assed bastard.

01:20:17.243 --> 01:20:22.751
- Are you talking to me or Norman?
- You shit-nosed little faggot.

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.057
Who, me?

01:20:25.867 --> 01:20:29.590
Listen, guys. We have a group of people
here who came out for a good time...

01:20:30.014 --> 01:20:33.351
and to say the least,
it's been a little bit strange.

01:20:35.337 --> 01:20:37.913
But we're counting on you
to get us through this.

01:20:38.013 --> 01:20:43.467
So I'm asking you, please, why don't
you just go and sleep it off, huh?

01:20:43.567 --> 01:20:45.392
Sleep this off.

01:20:52.488 --> 01:20:53.888
Yee-ha!

01:21:05.375 --> 01:21:09.863
Put the gun down!
Put down the goddamn gun!

01:21:14.223 --> 01:21:15.223
Phil.

01:21:15.683 --> 01:21:17.557
I'm not gonna let 'im
bully us any more.

01:21:18.492 --> 01:21:20.759
- My father-in-law's a bully.
- Phil.

01:21:20.859 --> 01:21:22.560
I hate bullies!

01:21:24.494 --> 01:21:26.562
Cause a bully doesn't
just beat you up.

01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:30.424
- He takes away your dignity.
- Phil!

01:21:30.956 --> 01:21:32.614
I hate that.

01:21:33.196 --> 01:21:36.109
I really... hate that.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:39.860
Sorry.

01:21:43.373 --> 01:21:44.373
Bang!

01:21:50.162 --> 01:21:52.800
All right, you two assholes,
go sleep it off.

01:21:58.472 --> 01:22:02.435
And let's have some peace and quiet
around here, for Christ's sakes!

01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:07.930
I'm tired. I've been
under a lot of stress.

01:22:08.983 --> 01:22:12.520
I lost my wife.
I lost my job.

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:17.807
And I've got some sort of rash...
from making in the bushes.

01:22:24.404 --> 01:22:26.576
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:40.817 --> 01:22:43.511
Phil, thanks.
That was amazing.

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:47.063
- What?
- You know, uh...

01:22:48.644 --> 01:22:51.644
Oh, that. Yeah.

01:22:53.532 --> 01:22:56.031
Why don't you...
put the gun down, Phil? Hmm?

01:22:56.673 --> 01:22:59.868
Oh, naw, you don't have to worry.
I know how to handle a gun.

01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:02.321
I used to keep one
at the store.

01:23:02.662 --> 01:23:05.818
You know, you lock up late at night,
there's a lot of cash around...

01:23:08.496 --> 01:23:12.472
Gotta make sure
the register totals match the... cash

01:23:12.572 --> 01:23:14.550
and... cheques
and the coupons...

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.275
Then you got the order forms
to fill out for the next day...

01:23:19.375 --> 01:23:23.019
You gotta check the stock.
I mean, there's a lot to do there.

01:23:23.119 --> 01:23:26.539
It's a... very responsible job.

01:23:32.693 --> 01:23:34.665
Oh, Christ!

01:23:37.073 --> 01:23:40.661
Oh, Phil.
Come on, Philly.

01:23:40.761 --> 01:23:43.012
Come on, man.
It's not that bad.

01:23:43.112 --> 01:23:47.842
I'm at a dead end. I'm almost
40 years old. I've wasted my life.

01:23:48.043 --> 01:23:52.137
Yeah, but now you get
a chance to start over. You know?

01:23:54.914 --> 01:23:57.787
Phil, remember
when we were kids?

01:23:57.887 --> 01:23:59.108
And we'd be playin' ball

01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:01.608
and the ball would get stuck up
in a tree or somethin'?

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:04.761
- And we'd yell "Do over!", huh?
- Yeah.

01:24:05.572 --> 01:24:09.986
Your life is a "do over".
You got a clean slate.

01:24:10.918 --> 01:24:12.526
I got no place to live.

01:24:13.444 --> 01:24:17.281
I'm gonna get wiped out in the divorce
cause I committed adultery.

01:24:18.711 --> 01:24:21.899
So I may never even
see my kids again.

01:24:22.397 --> 01:24:24.024
I'm alone.

01:24:26.947 --> 01:24:29.043
How's that slate look now?

01:24:31.348 --> 01:24:33.725
Well, the fun continues.

01:24:33.964 --> 01:24:35.845
- They're gone.
- Who?

01:24:35.945 --> 01:24:38.219
Jeff and TR.
They skedaddled.

01:24:40.214 --> 01:24:42.914
They jumped on their horses
and took off.

01:24:43.014 --> 01:24:44.590
They probably thought
we'd get 'em in trouble.

01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:45.504
Which we would.

01:24:45.604 --> 01:24:47.560
Does anybody know
how to get where we're goin'?

01:24:50.148 --> 01:24:52.168
So, we're talking death?

01:24:52.268 --> 01:24:54.199
Now, wait. Won't
Ben and Steve send some help?

01:24:54.299 --> 01:24:58.215
Maybe they won't. And when they left,
we were still pretty much okay.

01:24:58.374 --> 01:25:01.079
- Still, they might.
- "Might"?

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.796
We're hanging our lives
on "might"?

01:25:03.896 --> 01:25:07.572
Let's not get hysterical here,
okay? Calm down.

01:25:07.975 --> 01:25:11.289
Now, for four days,
we've been goin' in this direction.

01:25:11.389 --> 01:25:12.989
I think we keep goin'
in that direction.

01:25:13.097 --> 01:25:14.610
Isn't that a little vague?

01:25:15.288 --> 01:25:18.379
Curly said there was
a river and a valley.

01:25:18.479 --> 01:25:19.992
We'll just have to do
the best we can.

01:25:20.092 --> 01:25:22.210
So you're saying
we can drive this herd?

01:25:22.369 --> 01:25:24.963
A herd?
Are you delirious?

01:25:25.628 --> 01:25:29.063
We leave the herd. We'll go
ten times as fast without them.

01:25:30.273 --> 01:25:33.076
Oh, yeah, but there's no pasture land
up here. There's no water...

01:25:33.176 --> 01:25:35.485
I don't think
they can survive up here.

01:25:35.585 --> 01:25:38.945
Well, not to sound cold-hearted,
but so-the-hell-what?

01:25:39.794 --> 01:25:42.312
Look, I mean, they give us
a trail boss with a coronary

01:25:42.412 --> 01:25:43.604
they give us
a bunch of drunks

01:25:43.704 --> 01:25:45.587
and we're supposed
to worry about the cattle?

01:25:46.131 --> 01:25:50.214
- You're a nicer person than I am.
- No, you're right.

01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:53.569
Look, the rest of you go ahead.
I'll drive the herd.

01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:54.749
What are you talkin' about?

01:25:54.962 --> 01:25:57.012
I'm sayin' I think
I can bring in the herd.

01:25:57.170 --> 01:25:59.561
No, you can't.
What are you, crazy?

01:25:59.661 --> 01:26:01.132
You couldn't even
manage your stores.

01:26:01.232 --> 01:26:02.675
You had to bring in
your cousin.

01:26:02.848 --> 01:26:05.842
Mitch, you were right about
all the weekend warrior shit.

01:26:05.942 --> 01:26:09.304
The war games, the parachuting.
That was all bullshit.

01:26:09.404 --> 01:26:11.389
But this is real.
This is really happening.

01:26:11.489 --> 01:26:15.310
No rules, no games.
Just "Can I do it?"

01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:18.772
It is a game. It's your regular
game, Ed. Don't you see it?

01:26:18.872 --> 01:26:22.535
"Am I better than my father"?
Well, you are, okay?

01:26:22.635 --> 01:26:25.706
- Look, I need to do this.
- It's impossible.

01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:27.642
I'll do it with you.

01:26:29.477 --> 01:26:34.381
Phil. Phil... you have, like,
a day's worth of food 'n' water left.

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:36.066
- We'll be all right.
- Maybe you won't.

01:26:36.166 --> 01:26:37.357
Maybe we will, Mitch.

01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:38.689
Why don't you just accept

01:26:38.789 --> 01:26:40.543
that maybe you don't know
what we're goin' through?

01:26:40.643 --> 01:26:42.479
I know exactly
what you're goin' through.

01:26:42.579 --> 01:26:44.407
And you think that
bringing in this herd

01:26:44.507 --> 01:26:47.494
is gonna make all the broken pieces
of your life come together?

01:26:47.594 --> 01:26:50.304
Hey, you don't wanna do it,
don't do it. We wanna do it.

01:26:50.404 --> 01:26:51.413
I'm not doin' it.

01:26:51.513 --> 01:26:53.458
Don't do it.
I'm not askin' you to do it.

01:26:54.027 --> 01:26:56.843
You have been talking me
into doing stuff like this my whole life,

01:26:56.943 --> 01:26:58.609
and I am not doing this!

01:26:58.709 --> 01:27:01.574
What, are you deaf?
I'm not askin' you to do it.

01:27:01.674 --> 01:27:02.725
Great!

01:27:03.919 --> 01:27:05.454
Come on, Phil.

01:27:10.083 --> 01:27:11.668
It's crazy.

01:27:35.556 --> 01:27:40.280
We'll ride out together tomorrow
morning... without the herd.

01:27:42.289 --> 01:27:44.381
They can do
whatever they want.

01:28:02.887 --> 01:28:05.849
Come on.
We've got cattle to move.

01:28:10.255 --> 01:28:13.512
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doin'?

01:28:13.612 --> 01:28:16.773
I'm not listenin' to you.
Goddamn cattle drive.

01:28:16.873 --> 01:28:17.872
Just do your job.

01:28:17.972 --> 01:28:19.882
Don't tell me,
I'm not listenin' to you any more.

01:28:19.982 --> 01:28:20.915
Listen to the cows.

01:28:21.015 --> 01:28:22.732
Come on, you damn little doggies.
Come on, let's go.

01:28:22.832 --> 01:28:26.350
Hey, stop that!
Cut that out!

01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:27.421
What are you doin'?

01:28:27.521 --> 01:28:30.017
They're not cooperating.
This is like herding my children.

01:28:30.117 --> 01:28:33.534
- You take those. I'll take these.
- Hey, hey, come back here.

01:28:34.611 --> 01:28:37.525
Hey! Stop! Stop it!

01:28:37.889 --> 01:28:39.832
Stop!
Get back here!

01:28:39.932 --> 01:28:43.020
Ah, the hell with you.
Who needs you, anyway?

01:28:48.976 --> 01:28:49.976
What the he...?

01:28:51.996 --> 01:28:53.330
How did I do that?

01:28:57.261 --> 01:28:58.570
Hey, Mitch!

01:29:03.533 --> 01:29:06.920
It's Mitch!
Mitchy the Kid!

01:29:07.099 --> 01:29:09.867
Curly said there's nothing
like bringin' in a herd.

01:29:22.071 --> 01:29:23.762
Nice hat, partner.

01:29:26.652 --> 01:29:27.629
Come on.

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.527
Hey, there's my little man.

01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:33.751
Sorry I was late, but there was
so much traffic. Let's go. Ha!

01:29:39.804 --> 01:29:41.957
Nothin' to be ashamed of.
I had the same problem.

01:29:42.254 --> 01:29:44.242
Didn't you feel stupid?
I mean, you...

01:29:44.742 --> 01:29:47.704
Didn't you feel...
inadequate?

01:29:47.804 --> 01:29:50.123
Yeah, for a while.
But then I overcame it.

01:29:51.019 --> 01:29:54.334
Can I explain it you again? I mean,
promise me you won't get upset.

01:29:54.614 --> 01:29:57.357
Okay.
It's not gonna do any good.

01:29:58.417 --> 01:30:00.890
Okay. If you wanna
watch one show,

01:30:01.027 --> 01:30:03.075
but record another show
at the same time,

01:30:03.175 --> 01:30:05.314
the television set does not have
to be on channel three.

01:30:05.414 --> 01:30:06.714
- It does.
- No, it doesn't.

01:30:06.814 --> 01:30:09.792
If you're watching what you're
recording, then it has to be on three.

01:30:09.892 --> 01:30:12.854
- What... The TV or-or the machine?
- The TV.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.635
You're sayin' I can record
something I'm not even watching?

01:30:15.735 --> 01:30:18.791
Yes, that's the point.
You don't even need a TV to record.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.891
- How would I see it?
- Well, to see it, you need a TV.

01:30:21.991 --> 01:30:25.439
Shut up. Just shut up.
He doesn't get it!

01:30:25.539 --> 01:30:27.795
He'll never get it.
It's been four hours.

01:30:27.895 --> 01:30:30.207
The cows can tape
something by now.

01:30:30.307 --> 01:30:32.342
Forget about it,
please!

01:30:34.655 --> 01:30:38.088
- How do you do the clock?
- You're dead. You are dead!

01:31:03.744 --> 01:31:06.374
Let's go. Come on, Norman.
Keep up. Keep up.

01:31:06.534 --> 01:31:09.915
Norman, stay with the class.
Come on, boy.

01:31:10.246 --> 01:31:11.748
Aw, shit.

01:31:12.248 --> 01:31:15.210
- What do we do now?
- Like I should know?

01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:17.694
- Come on, let's keep the herd together.
- Yeah, let's go.

01:31:17.794 --> 01:31:20.396
Norman, hello?
Let's go, Norman.

01:31:20.686 --> 01:31:23.885
Norman, what are you,
Gene Kelly? Let's go!

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:39.032
Easy, boy.
Whoa! Easy, boy. Whoa!

01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:42.822
Go! Go, go!

01:31:54.114 --> 01:31:56.268
We're doin' great, guys.
We're drivin' 'em.

01:31:56.368 --> 01:31:59.873
Oh, that's perfect. We're lost,
but we're makin' good time.

01:31:59.973 --> 01:32:02.038
This is the way, guys.
I can feel it.

01:32:20.068 --> 01:32:23.140
- Is there a way around?
- That could be a hundred miles.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:26.102
- It could take days.
- Is this supposed to be here?

01:32:26.202 --> 01:32:29.613
There's probably an easy place
to cross but we missed it.

01:32:29.713 --> 01:32:33.005
- This could be the easy place!
- Oh, God.

01:32:33.316 --> 01:32:35.636
Look. We did the best we could.

01:32:35.736 --> 01:32:38.196
Let's just leave the herd
and get the hell outta here, huh?

01:32:38.296 --> 01:32:41.569
No! A cowboy
doesn't leave his herd.

01:32:42.067 --> 01:32:45.142
You are
a sporting-goods salesman!

01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:48.513
Not today.

01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:55.855
Easy... okay.

01:32:58.163 --> 01:33:01.339
I started this...
and I'm gonna finish it.

01:33:01.865 --> 01:33:03.276
I'm gonna finish it.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:14.802
It's fast, but it's not deep.
Come on, bring 'em down!

01:33:16.147 --> 01:33:18.882
Come on! Let's go!

01:33:24.839 --> 01:33:26.233
Oh, God.

01:33:49.952 --> 01:33:53.245
Come on, move!
Move it! Come on!

01:34:00.045 --> 01:34:02.089
Move it, now.
Come on.

01:34:04.494 --> 01:34:05.494
Whoa!

01:34:07.386 --> 01:34:08.386
Shit!

01:34:24.746 --> 01:34:28.116
Come on, boys! Come on, now.
Move it! Moo cow!

01:34:28.491 --> 01:34:30.410
Go, baby!
Go, baby!

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:34.581
Hey, Phil. I'm 39 and
I'm saying "moo cow" in a river.

01:34:35.608 --> 01:34:37.380
Do you believe this?

01:34:38.519 --> 01:34:40.636
- We did it!
- Hey!

01:35:01.758 --> 01:35:03.576
Here we go!

01:35:08.295 --> 01:35:09.575
Norman!

01:35:11.778 --> 01:35:12.778
Oh, God.

01:35:47.781 --> 01:35:48.781
Whoa!

01:35:58.875 --> 01:36:00.275
Norman!

01:36:02.796 --> 01:36:04.196
Norman!

01:36:06.968 --> 01:36:09.113
Norman! Norman!

01:36:10.263 --> 01:36:11.663
Norman!

01:36:15.643 --> 01:36:17.353
Got you. Help!

01:36:18.646 --> 01:36:20.494
Oh, my God.
Mitch!

01:36:20.594 --> 01:36:23.192
- Hey, Ed!
- Help! Help me!

01:36:26.487 --> 01:36:27.680
Oh, no.

01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:34.705
Mitch!

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.475
Oh, shit.

01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:29.584
I'm comin'!

01:37:30.804 --> 01:37:32.184
I'm coming'!

01:37:37.558 --> 01:37:39.239
I gotcha! I gotcha!

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:42.116
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

01:37:42.334 --> 01:37:44.620
Come on! Come on!

01:37:49.402 --> 01:37:50.590
I gotcha!

01:38:01.922 --> 01:38:04.071
Gimme your hand.
Gimme your hand.

01:38:12.073 --> 01:38:16.067
You're crazy. You talk about me,
but you're crazy.

01:38:17.309 --> 01:38:20.917
- You could've been killed!
- We almost lost you, pal.

01:38:30.248 --> 01:38:32.406
- Nice catch.
- Yeah.

01:38:33.794 --> 01:38:36.287
It was like Mays
in the '54 World Series.

01:38:37.246 --> 01:38:39.188
- Vic Wertz.
- Vic Wertz.

01:39:56.681 --> 01:39:58.830
- Let's bring 'em in.
- Yee-ha!

01:40:09.049 --> 01:40:12.051
Great gobs
of gooseshit!

01:40:12.261 --> 01:40:14.221
It's them!
Ira! Ira!

01:40:42.292 --> 01:40:43.492
Yahoo!

01:41:05.815 --> 01:41:07.715
Whoo! Whoo!

01:41:18.244 --> 01:41:20.845
Whoo!
Yee-ha!

01:41:28.005 --> 01:41:29.205
Yahoo!

01:41:31.342 --> 01:41:32.542
Yahoo!

01:41:38.335 --> 01:41:39.725
Way to go, guys.

01:41:42.228 --> 01:41:44.428
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:41:51.028 --> 01:41:52.863
Oh, Lordy, Lordy.

01:41:57.574 --> 01:41:58.820
Here's your herd.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.966
Up till it due, I'm as happy as
a puppy with two peters.

01:42:02.066 --> 01:42:03.986
We had a search party
out lookin' for you, boys.

01:42:04.319 --> 01:42:08.422
- They didn't find us.
- Un-by-God-believable.

01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:10.776
Bunch o' tenderfeet
bringin' in a herd like that.

01:42:10.876 --> 01:42:12.516
Two weeks ago,
you boys were as worthless

01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:14.402
as henshit
on a pump handle.

01:42:14.502 --> 01:42:16.091
Look at you now!

01:42:16.559 --> 01:42:18.233
I'm givin'
your money back!

01:42:19.975 --> 01:42:22.945
- Now you're talking, Clay.
- Hey, that's right.

01:42:23.102 --> 01:42:24.672
Instead of the money,
you think that, uh,

01:42:24.772 --> 01:42:26.603
my dad and I
could come back and, uh...

01:42:26.703 --> 01:42:29.845
- take the cattle back to New Mexico?
- Really, son?

01:42:29.945 --> 01:42:33.262
Ordinarily, that'd be great,
but this herd's not goin' back.

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:34.947
What do you mean?

01:42:35.321 --> 01:42:37.645
I'm gettin' top dollar
from the meat company.

01:42:39.262 --> 01:42:40.846
You mean
these cows are...?

01:42:40.946 --> 01:42:42.869
I thought you just moved 'em
back and forth.

01:42:42.969 --> 01:42:47.210
Usually do, but prices are
sky high, and I can't pass it up.

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.004
Look, folks, it's not like
any of 'em have a lot to live for.

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:58.347
They don't have
much of a life, anyway.

01:42:58.621 --> 01:43:01.133
Neither does Phil,
but we're not prepared to eat 'im.

01:43:01.297 --> 01:43:02.408
That's right.

01:43:02.508 --> 01:43:06.798
This is our business, son.
This is not an endangered species.

01:43:08.024 --> 01:43:10.407
It's what these animals
are bred for.

01:43:10.635 --> 01:43:13.116
All that meat under cellophane
in the supermarket,

01:43:13.216 --> 01:43:14.732
where you think
it comes from?

01:43:15.164 --> 01:43:17.098
Come on, fellas.
Just relax.

01:43:17.514 --> 01:43:19.547
You done real good,
cowboys.

01:43:19.778 --> 01:43:21.556
Let's get some grub.

01:43:38.347 --> 01:43:40.390
These cows trusted us.

01:43:41.141 --> 01:43:44.895
They trusted us?
They don't even know us!

01:43:44.995 --> 01:43:47.903
They followed us
because we yelled "Yah".

01:43:48.003 --> 01:43:49.399
They're cattle.

01:44:41.704 --> 01:44:42.704
What?

01:45:21.119 --> 01:45:23.378
I've gotta stop
bein' a schmuck.

01:45:24.413 --> 01:45:26.116
You know,
you were right, Mitch.

01:45:26.989 --> 01:45:32.338
My life is a "do over".
It's time to get started.

01:45:33.354 --> 01:45:35.050
I hope I can help.

01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:39.018
I'm gonna go home...

01:45:39.930 --> 01:45:41.914
and I'm gonna
get Kim pregnant.

01:45:42.014 --> 01:45:45.742
- I hope I can help.
- Oh, Mitchy the Kid's in trouble.

01:45:48.814 --> 01:45:50.976
- What about you?
- Hm?

01:45:51.316 --> 01:45:55.345
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Cause I know what he meant.

01:45:55.535 --> 01:45:57.990
- Who?
- Curly. I know what this is.

01:45:58.825 --> 01:46:01.489
- What?
- That's what you have to figure out.

01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:03.889
- I'm gonna deck you, pal.
- No, that's what it is.

01:46:03.989 --> 01:46:05.604
It's something different
for everybody.

01:46:05.704 --> 01:46:08.010
It's whatever's
most important to you.

01:46:08.110 --> 01:46:12.000
For me, when I was in the river,
I was only thinkin' about one thing.

01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:14.465
All that other stuff
just went away.

01:46:14.841 --> 01:46:17.313
Only one thing
really mattered to me.

01:46:18.344 --> 01:46:20.680
- Dad!
- Daddy, you're home!

01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:27.019
I love you.

01:46:28.437 --> 01:46:30.389
These faces.
I missed these faces.

01:46:30.489 --> 01:46:33.696
- We missed you too, daddy.
- It's no fun without you.

01:46:34.444 --> 01:46:36.110
Hey, buckaroos.

01:46:37.948 --> 01:46:40.754
- Next year, the North Pole.
- What?

01:46:40.854 --> 01:46:43.737
We hire dog sleds and we follow
the same route as Admiral Byrd.

01:46:43.837 --> 01:46:45.058
Uh-huh.

01:46:45.369 --> 01:46:48.341
Next Tuesday,
coffee and cake.

01:46:48.441 --> 01:46:49.698
Better.

01:46:49.798 --> 01:46:50.919
Come here.

01:46:55.299 --> 01:46:57.384
Hey, Phil!
You need a ride?

01:46:57.801 --> 01:46:59.511
No, thanks.
I got a cab.

01:47:15.543 --> 01:47:19.856
- So, how are you?
- Good. Things are good.

01:47:19.956 --> 01:47:21.870
Look what I found.

01:47:23.286 --> 01:47:26.933
Mm, that's nice.
Where was it?

01:47:27.077 --> 01:47:30.793
Colorado. I mean, it's always
the last place you look.

01:47:32.695 --> 01:47:34.589
Mitch,
I've been thinking.

01:47:35.381 --> 01:47:38.334
If you really hate your job,
why don't you get out of there?

01:47:38.434 --> 01:47:42.950
- We'll be all right.
- No. I'm not gonna quit my job.

01:47:43.050 --> 01:47:46.511
I'm just gonna do it better.
I'm gonna do everything better.

01:47:47.477 --> 01:47:49.484
Everything?

01:48:05.975 --> 01:48:07.050
See?

01:48:07.665 --> 01:48:10.988
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

01:48:12.043 --> 01:48:13.387
Let's go home.

01:48:13.877 --> 01:48:17.304
Today... is my best day.

01:48:22.459 --> 01:48:24.446
Mr. Robbins?

01:48:24.546 --> 01:48:25.956
Yeah, right here.

01:48:27.518 --> 01:48:29.081
This is great.

01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:32.401
- There you go.
- Thanks.

01:48:33.625 --> 01:48:36.144
- What, did you get a dog?
- We got a dog?!

01:48:36.244 --> 01:48:38.822
- All right!
- Come on, little man.

01:48:42.117 --> 01:48:45.362
Everyone, this is Norman.

01:48:46.997 --> 01:48:49.082
- It's a cow.
- Uh-uh.

01:48:49.715 --> 01:48:51.806
He's a calf, actually.

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.725
Mitch! You're gonna
put him in the van?

01:48:55.825 --> 01:48:57.652
Oh, yeah.
And then the den.

01:48:57.752 --> 01:48:59.716
Mitch, you're not gonna
take him home.

01:48:59.816 --> 01:49:02.125
See, kids,
he just said "Hello".

01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:06.507
Well, just for a little while.
Then we'll put him in a petting zoo...

01:49:06.607 --> 01:49:08.930
- so he can be with your mother.
- Mitch!

01:49:10.809 --> 01:49:12.808
I'm kiddin'!
I'm just kiddin'.

01:49:19.647 --> 01:49:22.563
- Okay, seat belts, Norman. Seat belts.
- Mitch!

01:49:22.842 --> 01:49:26.078
I hope you went to the bathroom,
mister, we got a long ride.

01:49:26.245 --> 01:49:28.391
- Mitch!
- Let's go home.
