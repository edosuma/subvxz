Hold on, old chum,
I've got an idea.

03:23.905 --> 03:24.837
Batman.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.339
Calling Batman and Robin.

03:33.381 --> 03:37.817

It's Alfred, I've turned on

03:42.056 --> 03:43.889
Alfred, Batman here.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.158
Oh, very good, sir.
I was concerned.

03:46.160 --> 03:50.496
Alfred, pull the short circuit
lever on the Bat-transmitter.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.598
Short circuit lever?

03:52.800 --> 03:57.269
But, sir, that will destroy
your wrist Bat-radio.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.472
Alfred, our relationship
has always been

04:00.474 --> 04:01.640
one of mutual respect.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.709
I cannot disregard
my own standards

04:03.711 --> 04:07.379
and order you to destroy
the Bat-transmitter.

04:07.381 --> 04:11.617
But I am urging you to comply.

04:12.787 --> 04:17.221
If you put it that way, sir.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.849
Wasn't that Batman and Robin?

04:43.851 --> 04:44.784
Ah, yes.

04:44.786 --> 04:47.853
Fighting crime
where ever it maybe.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.321
Good for them.

04:52.159 --> 04:56.528
Escaped the tricky twosome
tore free, thanks to you.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.362
Why accuse me, FF?

04:57.364 --> 05:01.233
Batman's a redoubtably
fine crime fighter.

05:01.235 --> 05:02.467
Fine, huh?

05:02.469 --> 05:05.771
Perhaps, you find him
attractive, intriguing..

05:05.773 --> 05:06.538
Was that it?

05:06.540 --> 05:09.708
I, False Face, I was merely
according Batman the respect due

05:09.710 --> 05:12.477
an outstanding adversary.
I haven't the slightest--

05:12.779 --> 05:17.716
Not so much protesting, Blaze,
and I'd believe you sooner.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.251
I say, do the deep-six
with her.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.821
Not so fast.
I make the moves in this mob.

05:21.823 --> 05:22.522
Yes, sir.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.192
I'll decide about you
in the morning, Blaze.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.729
Meanwhile, I warn you.

05:30.731 --> 05:36.435
One thing I will not allow
is anyone being false to me.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.360
Say, the radio message said

06:01.362 --> 06:03.295
"Many are called
but two are chosen?"

06:03.297 --> 06:07.132
Yes, sir. Clearly a reference
to yourself and Master Robin.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.835
I therefore activated
the Bat-alarm

06:09.837 --> 06:12.337
and called you on
the Bat-transmitter.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.138
Luckily for us.

06:13.140 --> 06:17.709
But gosh! Why'd False Face trap
us then send a warning? Why?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.179
He wouldn't.
But who would?

06:20.181 --> 06:25.217
The question is, Robin,
not only why, but who.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.320
Very neatly done, Alfred.
Thank you.

06:28.322 --> 06:31.523
Who sent that message?
Who?

06:33.794 --> 06:35.661
O'Hara, where have you been?

06:35.663 --> 06:38.497
On a garbage scow, commissioner.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.264
It's alright.

06:39.266 --> 06:42.534
In a sack, I was wrapped up
and abandoned.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.770
- That's criminal.
- That it is, sir.

06:44.772 --> 06:48.340
And that's why I'm concerned
about Batman and Robin.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.175
- The Caped Crusaders?
- Yes.

06:50.177 --> 06:55.180
Or I was put into
this condition by...False Face.

06:55.949 --> 07:00.185
Today, all Gotham City
is pulsating with one question.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.955
"What criminal outrage will
False Face perpetrate next?"

07:03.957 --> 07:07.058
Meanwhile, Police Chief O'Hara
shaken by his ordeal

07:07.060 --> 07:11.262
as the prisoner of the masked
master of criminal concealment

07:11.264 --> 07:12.664
has sworn revenge.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.165
Chief O'Hara
will broadcast an appeal

07:14.167 --> 07:18.203
to the citizenry
of Gotham City later tonight.

07:18.205 --> 07:18.970
Of course.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.739
- What is it, Batman?
- Broadcast.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.741
We'll trace that mysterious
radio message

07:22.743 --> 07:24.376
back to it's
broadcasting source.

07:24.378 --> 07:27.312
- Holy transistors!
- Let's go.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.910
'Who ordered that announcement?'

07:58.912 --> 08:00.979
'A complete stranger.
Anonymous.'

08:00.981 --> 08:03.114
'Frankly, Batman,
I assumed that it was'

08:03.116 --> 08:04.149
'simply another announcement.'

08:04.151 --> 08:07.085
If someone wishes a message
broadcast like

08:07.087 --> 08:09.087
"Many are called,
two are chosen"

08:09.089 --> 08:11.256
I assume it's religious
and that's all.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.893
I don't think we should treat
religion lightly, Mr. Gore.

08:14.895 --> 08:15.727
Oh, of course not.

08:15.729 --> 08:19.764
I merely meant I treated it
as part of the day's work.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.267
Then it's another dead end.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.334
Thanks to False Face.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.704
Is that who's involved?
False Face?

08:25.706 --> 08:26.738
The criminal master of disguise?

08:26.740 --> 08:30.842
None other. That's why we hoped
you'd give us a clue.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.378
I'm sorry that..

08:33.380 --> 08:36.246
I say,
there was one little thing

08:36.249 --> 08:38.049
that you might call peculiar.

08:38.051 --> 08:38.717
What is it?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.919
The young lady who paid
for the announcement

08:40.921 --> 08:43.221
she was not only
staggeringly beautiful

08:43.222 --> 08:44.456
she had green hair.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.156
Green hair!

08:45.158 --> 08:46.157
- Holy wigs!
- Blaze.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.860
'Does that mean
anything to you?'

08:48.862 --> 08:49.961
Indeed it does.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.298
Good observation, Gore.
Darn good observation.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.234
Then perhaps you
can tell me what she meant

08:56.236 --> 08:57.235
by a parting remark.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.304
As she handed me
the check in payment

08:59.306 --> 09:03.341
she said "I could bank
on its being false."

09:03.343 --> 09:07.011
Check bank false.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.247
What bank was
that check drawn on?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.982
'Gotham National.'

09:10.984 --> 09:11.483
Of course.

09:11.485 --> 09:14.252
That's the bank the False Face
is planning to break.

09:14.254 --> 09:18.490
- You mean the check is no good?
- Not as a check, Mr. Gore.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.325
But as a message. Yes.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.460
Send the check
to Commissioner Gordon.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.763
I'll see that you're paid.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.813
Blaze ordered
the radio announcement?

09:41.815 --> 09:44.215
- And saved our lives.
- She did even more than that.

09:44.217 --> 09:48.453
At great risk, she gave us the
clues to False Face's next move.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.420
How so, Batman?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.522
When she handed the man

09:50.524 --> 09:52.157
a check in payment
for the announcement

09:52.159 --> 09:55.059
she said, he could bank
on it being false.

09:55.061 --> 09:56.194
Sounds rather cryptic to me.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.330
The check was drawn in
the Gotham City National Bank.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.231
It baffles me, Batman

10:00.233 --> 10:02.567
if False Face contemplates
a counterfeiting coup

10:02.569 --> 10:03.968
why he'd break into a bank?

10:03.970 --> 10:06.404
For a double dose
of diabolical deception.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.439
Think, what's in a bank?

10:08.441 --> 10:10.008
- Money?
- Right.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.576
And what is False Face
been forging?

10:11.578 --> 10:13.278
- Money, counterfeit money.
- Right again.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.181
And think of the consequences
if False Face would place

10:16.183 --> 10:18.883
the bank's good money
with counterfeit currency.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.452
Ghastly!
It's gambling for billions.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.589
Gosh, nobody's money would
be worth anything.

10:24.591 --> 10:25.390
Except False Face's.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.493
And nobody would be able to tell
true from false.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.360
He must be stopped.

10:29.362 --> 10:35.600
No, he must be encouraged,
enticed and only then..

10:35.602 --> 10:37.169
...entrapped.

10:37.171 --> 10:39.438
But how?

10:39.440 --> 10:41.540
By falsehood.

10:42.543 --> 10:43.608
<i> Falsehood?</i>

10:43.610 --> 10:48.814
<i> Is batman capable of</i>
<i> out-falsing False Face?</i>

11:26.887 --> 11:27.486
Perfect.

11:27.488 --> 11:30.822
No one suspected you were
hiding in here all day.

11:30.824 --> 11:31.723
Now the bank is closed

11:31.725 --> 11:34.192
and we're ready
to begin our attack, right?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.727
'Right, FF.'

11:35.729 --> 11:38.129
Brinks, the bars.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.223
Very good, Brinks.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.691
Benz,

12:06.693 --> 12:10.161
Careful now, there's a very
cunning electric eye set

12:10.163 --> 12:12.931
just 18 inches above the floor.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.300
- Go!
- Right, FF.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.727
Electric eye alarm, eliminated.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.698
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.834
Pinkerton, the TNT
time talking..

12:49.836 --> 12:51.670
Yes, FF.

12:57.711 --> 12:59.945
Back, back!

13:04.084 --> 13:05.951
- We did it, FF.
- We're rich!

13:05.953 --> 13:07.752
Beyond the dreams of avarice.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.921
Not my dreams of avarice.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.824
Quickly now, loot sacks out.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.864
Now, let me at that lock.
Is it clean?

13:19.866 --> 13:21.733
I'll dust it, FF.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.069
He's so fastidious.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.773
What? Is it possible?

13:28.775 --> 13:31.710
Not only possible but true.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.112
Please, not that word.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.782
We've turned your own tricky
tables on you, False Face.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.284
Via a false vault.

13:39.286 --> 13:44.089
I'm never out-tricked
until the last turn, Boy Wonder.

13:52.766 --> 13:57.836
Chief O'Hara, tell your men
to search all these cubicles.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.751
- Careful!
- Ow!

14:12.753 --> 14:17.656
- I'll handle him, chief.
- Good man.

14:23.764 --> 14:24.396
He's been gassed.

14:24.398 --> 14:26.898
By that counterfeit
policeman False Face.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.267
After him, Robin!

14:36.276 --> 14:38.710
The dogged duo
is in hot pursuit.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.278
And they'll catch you,
False Face.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.948
'I hope so.
I sincerely hope so.'

14:43.950 --> 14:44.816
Because, you little fool

14:44.818 --> 14:49.454
I'm leading them into
a truly torturous trap.

14:55.529 --> 14:58.731
<i> What is False Face's</i>
<i> fiendish foolery?</i>

14:58.733 --> 15:03.202
<i> Are the Caped Crusaders heading</i>
<i> into a cul-de-sac?</i>

15:03.204 --> 15:04.403
<i> Will this be the dead end</i>

15:04.405 --> 15:08.007
<i> for the dedicated deeds</i>
<i> of Batman and Robin?</i>

15:08.009 --> 15:11.343
The old Bioscope Studios
has been abandoned for years.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.045
False Face must have
his hideout here

15:13.047 --> 15:15.381
in the crumbling sets
and faded false front.

15:15.383 --> 15:18.517
We'll expose his concealments
to the light of day

15:18.519 --> 15:21.687
and put him behind real bars.

15:31.399 --> 15:34.266
Good. They're hot on my trail.

15:34.268 --> 15:38.303
And very soon,
they maybe even hotter.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.340
As a matter of fact,
perhaps too hot.

15:41.342 --> 15:44.376
Oh, you monster!

16:05.667 --> 16:08.100
Holy rats in a trap!

16:10.238 --> 16:12.104
False Face is getting away.

16:12.106 --> 16:16.709
No, Robin, he seems
to be coming back this way.

16:17.745 --> 16:19.912
What's he up to?

16:19.914 --> 16:22.915
Let's find out.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.332
Commissioner, dispatch a patrol
car immediately

17:13.334 --> 17:17.136
to the Bioscope Studios
to pick up a couple of thugs

17:17.137 --> 17:18.303
that Robin and I netted.

17:18.305 --> 17:21.240
And we expect
to add False Face himself

17:21.242 --> 17:23.474
to the collection shortly.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.111
False Face may still
have a plot or two

17:26.113 --> 17:28.047
in his bag of fiendish tricks.

17:28.049 --> 17:32.818
It's time for a little trickery
of our own, Robin.

17:54.542 --> 17:59.211
They're coming right at me.

18:04.819 --> 18:06.552
Aah!

18:09.690 --> 18:12.357
I've done it. I've done it!

18:12.359 --> 18:14.526
I destroyed the Dynamic Duo.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.595
You diabolical demon!

18:16.597 --> 18:17.596
Ah-ha!

18:17.598 --> 18:22.301
Well, your clever Caped
Crusaders are now kaput.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.580
Brilliantly done, Batman.

18:34.582 --> 18:38.851
But I blew up the Batmobile.
I saw it go.

18:38.853 --> 18:40.519
Not exactly, False Face.

18:40.521 --> 18:42.254
You destroyed a false Batmobile.

18:42.256 --> 18:44.456
And inflated duplicate
that I prepared

18:44.458 --> 18:46.191
for just this
kind of situation.

18:46.193 --> 18:50.362
Face it, False Face.
You've been out-decoyed.

18:50.364 --> 18:52.564
You fell for a phony target.

18:52.566 --> 18:56.468
Now, will you come quietly?

18:57.404 --> 19:00.472
Not yet, Dynamic Duo.

19:07.781 --> 19:12.151
Wait, it's faster on foot.
Get me outta here.

20:21.589 --> 20:23.722
Stay here, Robin.

20:25.259 --> 20:27.826
Howdy, partner.
What's all the ruckus?

20:27.828 --> 20:31.897
'There's a criminal loose.'

20:31.899 --> 20:33.632
Rustlers, huh?

20:33.634 --> 20:36.902
Well, I'll join
the posse myself.

20:38.739 --> 20:41.740
I'll head 'em off at the pass.

20:41.909 --> 20:45.477
Intercepted, False Face.

21:16.844 --> 21:18.277
Commissioner.

21:18.279 --> 21:18.877
Are you alright?

21:18.879 --> 21:21.413
Yeah, chief. But the trickster
got away from me.

21:21.415 --> 21:23.582
- Vanished that way.
- Let's get after him.

21:23.584 --> 21:24.616
Yes, I'll send reinforcement.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.585
Chief, I must get back
to my office.

21:26.587 --> 21:29.554
- Order me a squad car.
- That's not necessary.

21:29.556 --> 21:30.489
False Face must be found

21:30.491 --> 21:32.491
before he springs another
sinister scheme.

21:32.493 --> 21:36.695
Absolutely accurate...
False Face.

21:38.032 --> 21:41.033
But, Caped Crusader,
that's the commissioner.

21:41.035 --> 21:41.934
Is it?

21:41.936 --> 21:43.469
Then why is a right-handed
commissioner

21:43.471 --> 21:46.605
holding his handkerchief
in his left hand.

21:56.417 --> 21:58.217
Saints alive.

21:58.219 --> 21:59.151
It's False Face.

21:59.153 --> 22:02.988
So you finally fumbled,
False Face.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.957
For the moment.

22:04.959 --> 22:06.926
I lost him.

22:07.128 --> 22:10.329
Luckily, commissioner,
he found us.

22:10.631 --> 22:12.798
Impersonating
a police commissioner.

22:12.800 --> 22:18.637
Well, the warden will be workin'
out a warm welcome for you.

22:20.007 --> 22:23.175
Game and set to you,
Cape Crusader.

22:23.177 --> 22:28.480
But wait, you may yet
meet your match.

22:37.859 --> 22:40.926
Come, come, now.
Let's not be late.

22:40.928 --> 22:44.163
You know how sensitive
a criminal can be

22:44.165 --> 22:45.197
the first day of parole.

22:45.199 --> 22:47.967
- But which criminal?
- And why here?

22:47.969 --> 22:51.871
Because the Bruce Wayne
rehabilitation fund

22:51.873 --> 22:53.272
arranged for it all.

22:53.274 --> 22:54.106
And I must say

22:54.108 --> 22:58.077
I think this one magnificent
success justifies

22:58.079 --> 22:59.044
the entire risk.

22:59.046 --> 23:06.118
Just think, a hardened criminal
completely reformed.

23:06.988 --> 23:09.622
'You may come in now.'

23:09.624 --> 23:13.659
- Penguin?
- Joker?

23:16.131 --> 23:18.131
Blaze.

23:20.869 --> 23:23.102
Good morning, Mr. Wayne.

23:23.104 --> 23:24.971
Mr. Grayson.

23:24.973 --> 23:28.174
I wanna thank you
personally, Mr. Wayne.

23:28.176 --> 23:31.611
Because of your
rehabilitation fund

23:31.613 --> 23:33.646
I feel like a new girl.

23:33.648 --> 23:35.748
The pleasure is truly mine.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.150
What are your plans now, miss?

23:37.152 --> 23:38.551
I plan to go to New Zealand

23:38.553 --> 23:41.454
to keep house for my poor,
but honest brother.

23:41.456 --> 23:45.425
He's a sheep herder.
An entire new life.

23:45.427 --> 23:47.126
I think that's simply fine.

23:47.128 --> 23:51.664
And you are one of the two men
who've made this possible.

23:51.666 --> 23:55.435
Two men?
Who was the other one?

23:55.437 --> 23:56.135
Batman.

23:56.137 --> 23:58.871
'The scourge of crime?'

23:58.873 --> 24:01.607
Cape crusader himself.

24:01.609 --> 24:04.444
I hope when I've paid my debt
to society

24:04.446 --> 24:08.480
that I can in some way,
somehow repay Batman.

24:08.482 --> 24:12.018
I would think that somehow
he knows of your redemption.

24:12.020 --> 24:15.188
And somewhere he's glad.

24:31.079 --> 24:33.746
