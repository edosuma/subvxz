00:07.543 --> 00:11.790
Everybody was happy to see the war
coming to an end.

00:12.048 --> 00:17.089
The Germans didn't have a heart for it
and realized the end was there.

00:17.303 --> 00:21.965
We used to say, “The only good Kraut
is a dead one”. Well…

00:22.224 --> 00:25.640
Most of them were kids.
We all were kids.

00:25.853 --> 00:28.427
They had a job to do,
same as me.

00:28.689 --> 00:33.398
We went about and did the job
that we had to do.

00:33.653 --> 00:39.940
We thought Germans were
the evilest people in the world.

00:41.035 --> 00:46.492
As the war went along, we found that
it wasn't the Germans, per se.

00:46.707 --> 00:49.412
I've thought about this often.

00:49.669 --> 00:53.168
That man and I might've been
good friends.

00:53.381 --> 00:56.501
He might've liked to fish,
or to hunt.

00:56.759 --> 00:58.170
You never know.

00:58.386 --> 01:03.381
Of course, we were both doing
what we were supposed to do…

01:03.600 --> 01:08.143
but under different circumstances,
we might've been friends.

04:35.146 --> 04:37.768
That way. That way.

05:36.041 --> 05:40.252
One thing about the Krauts.
They sure clean up good.

05:40.504 --> 05:44.715
Yeah, all you need is a little Mozart.

05:45.217 --> 05:46.877
Beethoven.

05:47.135 --> 05:50.421
–Sorry, sir?
–That's not Mozart.

05:51.181 --> 05:53.672
That's Beethoven.

06:11.785 --> 06:13.529
Come on, chicken.

06:13.787 --> 06:16.361
All right, this one's got some,
George.

06:16.540 --> 06:19.245
You grab the chicken,
I grab the eggs.

06:19.501 --> 06:20.533
Great. Fine.

06:21.086 --> 06:23.293
Grab him by the foot. Come on.

06:23.505 --> 06:27.669
If this thing bites me, Frank,
I swear I'll shoot it.

06:34.391 --> 06:36.183
Hold on!

06:36.477 --> 06:39.810
–Come on, George.
–Hold on a second. Hold on.

06:40.689 --> 06:43.607
Hey, come on.
I just wanna talk to you.

06:47.321 --> 06:49.729
I just want to talk.

06:51.951 --> 06:53.860
Look what I got.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.702
Chocolate bar. You like that?
You like chocolate?

06:57.957 --> 07:02.002
–Luz, leave her alone.
–Frank, leave me alone, okay?

07:02.253 --> 07:04.708
Don't like chocolate?
How's this?

07:04.964 --> 07:07.336
Cigarettes. Camel.

07:07.592 --> 07:09.501
–Yeah, you like that.
–Luz—

07:10.386 --> 07:12.924
Frank, go make your omelet!

07:13.556 --> 07:16.841
You ain't getting my eggs, blockhead.

07:17.059 --> 07:19.681
My friend just keeps talking.

07:19.896 --> 07:23.430
I got two packs here.
Give it to your friends.

07:24.150 --> 07:27.067
Why don't you come sit?
Wanna sit down?

07:28.613 --> 07:32.776
That's it.
We'll smoke cigarettes.

07:37.121 --> 07:39.743
Hey, Frank. Hold on.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.328
Perc.

07:41.584 --> 07:43.292
Jesus, come on.

07:46.130 --> 07:47.673
What?

07:56.891 --> 07:59.513
–That Captain Nixon?
–I think so.

07:59.769 --> 08:02.556
–Why's he in his harness?
–I don't know.

08:02.814 --> 08:06.681
Maybe we jumped into Berlin,
the war's over.

08:07.110 --> 08:11.357
–No dice with the Fräulein?
–She smacked me in the mouth.

08:11.614 --> 08:15.908
Germany's looking like pretty good
fraternizing territory.

08:16.119 --> 08:18.159
Lose your cigarettes?

08:18.455 --> 08:20.412
Oh, God! Yeah, yeah.

08:20.665 --> 08:22.325
God!

08:29.674 --> 08:32.212
–Janovec?
–Oh, shit!

08:34.638 --> 08:36.346
Sir!

08:36.597 --> 08:38.222
Where's my stuff?

08:39.351 --> 08:42.471
I thought I'd leave it
over there, sir.

09:09.506 --> 09:11.131
Here.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.851
–Thanks.
–You're welcome, sir.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.811
Sir.

09:36.408 --> 09:39.611
–Morning, sir.
–Good morning.

09:39.995 --> 09:45.238
–You got a box all this will fit into?
–Yes, sir. Same destination?

09:45.793 --> 09:47.121
Yeah.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.379
I'll make sure it goes out
first thing.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.083
Thank you, private.

09:52.299 --> 09:55.882
Your folks'll have quite a collection
when you get…

09:57.304 --> 09:59.630
home, sir.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.510
Finders, keepers.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.305
Yes, sir.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.338
Nix?

10:31.839 --> 10:34.710
–Nix?
–In here.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.891
You dog.

10:44.185 --> 10:48.894
Making combat jumps while I'm
in supply briefings all morning.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.642
Yeah, lucky me.

10:50.858 --> 10:57.360
You're the only man in the 101st
with three stars over his jump wings.

10:57.615 --> 11:01.529
Not bad for someone
who's never fired in combat.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.364
Really?

11:03.621 --> 11:05.661
–Really, you've never—?
–Nope.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.044
Even with all the action we've seen?

11:10.295 --> 11:12.501
Not a round.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.341
So…

11:20.305 --> 11:23.590
How'd it go this morning?
The jump?

11:23.808 --> 11:27.557
It was great. Fantastic.

11:28.897 --> 11:33.689
Took a direct hit over the drop zone.
I got out. Two others.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.016
The rest?

11:36.237 --> 11:39.772
They blew up over Germany somewhere.
Boom.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.819
–Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
–About what?

11:45.664 --> 11:49.661
–Tough situation for the—
–Yeah, the boys. Terrible.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.373
Oh well, wasn't me.

11:55.131 --> 11:59.129
You know, the real tragedy is,
they also lost their CO.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.303
Guess who gets to write
the letters home?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.762
Goddamn nightmare.

12:12.566 --> 12:16.433
Got a visit from Colonel Sink
this morning.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.905
–And how is the good colonel?
–Concerned.

12:25.329 --> 12:28.863
Still drinking nothing but Vat 69?

12:29.124 --> 12:33.169
Only the finest
for Mrs Nixon's baby boy.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.705
That a problem up at Regiment?

12:37.507 --> 12:41.173
What, this? Is that what he said?

12:41.386 --> 12:43.794
No, I just don't like it up there.

12:44.056 --> 12:45.680
Good.

12:45.891 --> 12:51.182
You'll be happy to hear that Sink is
transferring you to Battalion S3.

12:52.064 --> 12:55.896
What do you think I should write
to these parents?

12:56.527 --> 13:01.023
–Hear what I said? You've been demoted.
–Demoted, got you.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.567
How do I tell them
their kids never made it out?

13:04.827 --> 13:09.453
Tell them what you always tell them.
Their sons died as heroes.

13:09.707 --> 13:12.328
You really still believe that?

13:13.752 --> 13:17.252
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.917
Don't you?

13:25.264 --> 13:29.214
The Cooperative for American
Remittance to Europe…

13:29.477 --> 13:35.811
is assembling food packs to assist
European families in dire need.

13:36.025 --> 13:37.934
Presumably all of them.

13:38.194 --> 13:43.698
Notes to your family reminding them
to donate are appreciated.

13:44.450 --> 13:49.361
I'm sure you'll all be happy to know
Oklahoma is still playing.

14:01.384 --> 14:06.295
O'Keefe, you sitting on your bayonet?
Leave the singing to Luz.

14:06.556 --> 14:10.423
Unless you wanna do
“Surrey With the Fringe on Top”.

14:10.685 --> 14:14.268
–Rita Hayworth's getting married.
–Say it isn't true.

14:14.522 --> 14:16.894
Abbott and Costello…

14:19.235 --> 14:24.609
Resistance in Ruhr's crumbling.
Might be a breakout in Remagen.

14:25.116 --> 14:29.244
The Krauts forgot to blow up
one of their bridges.

14:29.704 --> 14:33.369
I guess the 17th Airborne
did okay, after all.

14:33.583 --> 14:37.711
We'd be in Berlin by now,
if it was us instead of them.

14:40.882 --> 14:43.503
Perconte! How you doing?

14:43.885 --> 14:47.336
When will we jump into Berlin,
see some real action?

14:47.555 --> 14:49.881
–You in a rush?
–No.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.804
What, you want a Medal of Honor?

14:53.061 --> 14:57.806
–I just thought I'd ask.
–Do us all a favor. Don't think.

14:58.441 --> 15:00.398
Damn replacements.

15:09.828 --> 15:12.153
–Hallelujah.
–About time.

15:12.414 --> 15:16.743
You're lucky. Nixon was giving
a current-events lecture.

15:16.918 --> 15:19.670
–Tell me nothing's happening.
–Nothing.

15:19.921 --> 15:24.879
Couple of artillery rounds at dawn,
probably from across the river.

15:25.135 --> 15:28.883
That's about it.
It spooked Hashey, though.

15:29.681 --> 15:32.931
–Here, I just finished it.
–Any sex in it?

15:33.185 --> 15:35.510
Ain't that kind of book.

15:36.063 --> 15:38.980
–See you.
–Yeah, see you.

15:56.667 --> 15:59.703
Hey, O'Brien.
Relax, I'm trying to read.

15:59.962 --> 16:01.954
It's O'Keefe.

16:02.172 --> 16:03.453
Is that right?

16:03.715 --> 16:07.334
Patrick O'Keefe.
My friends call me Paddy.

16:23.610 --> 16:26.647
Hey, O'Brien. Shut up!

16:26.905 --> 16:29.278
I told you, it's O'Keefe.

16:30.743 --> 16:35.037
Know why no one remembers your name?
No one wants to.

16:35.289 --> 16:39.037
There's too many Smiths, DiMattos
and O'Keefes…

16:39.293 --> 16:44.370
who replace Toccoa men that you
got killed in the first place.

16:44.632 --> 16:47.419
They're all like you.
Piss and vinegar.

16:47.635 --> 16:51.419
“Where are the Krauts?
When do we jump into Berlin?”

16:51.680 --> 16:54.847
Two days later,
their guts are hanging out…

16:55.059 --> 16:59.555
and they're screaming for a medic,
begging for their mother.

16:59.772 --> 17:02.726
Dumb fucks don't even know
they're dead.

17:02.942 --> 17:04.401
You listening to me?

17:04.652 --> 17:07.487
This is the best part of war
I've seen.

17:07.738 --> 17:11.272
I got hot chow, hot showers,
warm bed.

17:11.534 --> 17:16.694
Germany is as good as being home.
I wiped my ass with real toilet paper.

17:17.498 --> 17:19.675
Quit asking if you'll see action.

17:19.834 --> 17:23.285
And stop with the fucking love songs.

17:45.151 --> 17:50.193
–When you ship out? A few weeks ago?
–Yeah.

17:52.742 --> 17:56.158
It's been two years since I seen home.

17:56.788 --> 17:58.365
Two years.

17:59.290 --> 18:01.746
This fucking war.

18:03.586 --> 18:06.291
Neither patrol found one Kraut.

18:06.548 --> 18:09.848
They're across the river now.
Send a night patrol.

18:10.009 --> 18:12.797
Check the embankment
on the far side.

18:14.681 --> 18:17.219
President's dead.

18:19.644 --> 18:22.135
Pair of queens bets.

18:22.397 --> 18:26.181
–All right, 2 bucks.
–Nix?

18:28.069 --> 18:30.525
–No, I'm out.
–All right.

18:30.780 --> 18:36.486
Well, I'll call your 2
and I'll raise you another 2.

18:36.870 --> 18:41.199
–Can't believe we won't go to Berlin.
–No shit.

18:41.458 --> 18:45.076
–Ike'll let the Russkies have it.
–Russkies.

18:46.421 --> 18:48.248
Goddamn it.

18:48.465 --> 18:52.379
This war's not about fighting,
it's about who gets what.

18:52.594 --> 18:55.215
Deal me out of the next hand.

18:55.472 --> 18:57.678
What about your money?

18:59.017 --> 19:01.555
–Are we waiting on him again?
–Yeah.

19:53.572 --> 19:56.407
Goddamn drugstore.

20:02.873 --> 20:04.617
Sir.

20:07.753 --> 20:09.662
Hey guys, wait up!

20:10.381 --> 20:12.457
–Hey, Dexter.
–Good to see you.

20:12.716 --> 20:15.670
–You know who that was?
–No.

20:28.524 --> 20:30.351
Morning.

20:30.568 --> 20:34.482
Captain Nixon, good to see you.
I have mail for you.

20:34.739 --> 20:39.401
I was gonna drop it off this afternoon
with all the other mail…

20:39.660 --> 20:43.029
but since you're here…

20:43.789 --> 20:47.490
Listen, I'm having some trouble
finding whiskey.

20:47.752 --> 20:51.500
–Whiskey?
–A particular brand of whiskey.

20:51.798 --> 20:54.004
–Vat 69.
–Exactly right.

20:54.258 --> 20:57.378
That won't be easy to find
here in Germany.

20:57.637 --> 20:59.843
–Pickings are slim.
–I know it.

21:00.098 --> 21:04.309
And even if I do find some, sir,
it won't be cheap.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.514
–Not a problem.
–Vest, you hear the news?

21:07.730 --> 21:10.648
–Sir, I didn't know you were here.
–News?

21:11.109 --> 21:13.397
300·000 Krauts just surrendered.

21:13.653 --> 21:17.318
–Three hundred?
–We're moving out in an hour.

21:17.574 --> 21:19.862
–One hour?
–Yeah.

21:21.452 --> 21:24.572
Sir? Sir! Your mail.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.743
Keep looking.

21:33.465 --> 21:37.794
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Get a move on. Let's go.

21:40.722 --> 21:42.549
Jesus Christ. The dog?

21:42.807 --> 21:44.599
Lew?

21:45.560 --> 21:49.178
–Cathy's divorcing me.
–I'm sorry.

21:50.273 --> 21:52.515
She's taking everything.

21:53.485 --> 21:58.396
She's taking the house, taking the kid,
she's taking the dog.

21:58.615 --> 22:03.989
It's not even her dog. It's my dog!
She's taking my dog!

22:05.497 --> 22:08.414
Let's go! Load it up!
Come on!

22:18.218 --> 22:20.839
What do you have in here?
Germans?

22:21.096 --> 22:22.887
Hey, Perconte.

22:23.181 --> 22:26.348
–Got a lighter?
–No, sir. Where we headed?

22:26.560 --> 22:28.967
The Alps.
Let me see that lighter.

22:29.229 --> 22:31.138
–The Alps?
–Yeah.

22:31.398 --> 22:33.189
–That near Berlin?
–No.

22:33.400 --> 22:37.896
That's in Bavaria.
Birthplace of National Socialism.

22:38.155 --> 22:40.860
So that means no drop into Berlin?

22:41.116 --> 22:45.529
Hitler sent the Waffen SS into
the mountains to repel invaders.

22:45.746 --> 22:50.787
–He wants to start a guerrilla war.
–Invaders. Damn, I like that.

22:51.043 --> 22:53.878
They'll die the last man trying.

22:54.088 --> 22:55.914
–Sir.
–What?

22:56.632 --> 22:58.459
My lighter.

23:02.721 --> 23:05.675
–All right, nice lighter.
–Thanks.

23:05.933 --> 23:07.641
Waffen SS, huh?

23:07.851 --> 23:12.976
You'll get your wish, O'Flannery.
Those guys are crazy.

23:13.565 --> 23:15.642
It's O'Keefe.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.483
–You okay, Nix?
–Yeah, I'm fine.

24:06.702 --> 24:09.490
She hates that dog.

24:40.987 --> 24:44.901
It's gonna be good times, Web.
When we get home.

24:45.700 --> 24:49.828
I'm gonna get my job back
at the cab company in Frisco.

24:50.079 --> 24:54.409
Make a killing off all those
fucking sailors coming home.

24:54.709 --> 24:59.916
Then I'm gonna find a nice Jewish girl
with great big soft titties…

25:00.173 --> 25:02.379
and a smile to die for.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.093
Marry her.

25:04.344 --> 25:08.176
Then I'm gonna buy a big house
with lots of bedrooms…

25:08.431 --> 25:11.302
for all the little Liebgotts.

25:11.518 --> 25:13.036
She ought to like that.

25:13.186 --> 25:15.642
Janovec, what you reading?

25:16.982 --> 25:21.809
–An article.
–No shit. What's it about?

25:22.070 --> 25:25.653
It's about why we're
fighting the war.

25:26.867 --> 25:29.784
Why are we fighting the war, Janovec?

25:30.370 --> 25:34.071
It seems that the Germans are bad.
Very bad.

25:34.332 --> 25:37.536
You don't say?
The Germans are bad?

25:37.961 --> 25:42.919
Frank, this guy's reading an article,
says the Germans are bad.

25:43.175 --> 25:46.045
–And you, Web?
–Learn something every day.

25:46.303 --> 25:49.672
I guess I'll finish school first,
and then—

25:49.890 --> 25:52.844
Wait a minute. Finish school?

25:53.393 --> 25:58.221
You're always talking about Harvard
and you haven't even finished?

25:58.440 --> 26:01.227
I haven't told you anything.

26:01.443 --> 26:04.812
Yes, I haven't finished.
So the fuck what?

26:05.072 --> 26:09.116
All right, let it breathe a little.
Jesus. Fuck.

26:10.369 --> 26:15.909
It's just the way you always talked.
We all figured that…

26:19.128 --> 26:21.963
You know, you're right.
So the fuck what?

26:26.176 --> 26:28.750
So, what did you study?

26:31.765 --> 26:33.260
Literature.

26:33.517 --> 26:36.091
Get out of here. You serious?

26:36.353 --> 26:38.061
–I love to read.
–Do you?

26:38.314 --> 26:42.691
Yeah. Dick Tracy,
Flash Gordon, mostly.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.310
Yeah. Fuck.

26:52.703 --> 26:55.621
–Keep moving.
–Up three.

27:01.045 --> 27:03.666
Tell her she's got five minutes.

27:05.716 --> 27:07.673
Go, go, go!

27:13.766 --> 27:16.767
Sir, she says she's got
nowhere to go.

27:17.311 --> 27:19.518
This guy says he's not a Nazi.

27:19.730 --> 27:22.019
Why haven't I met one Nazi?

27:22.233 --> 27:26.100
We'll only be here one night!
You have four minutes!

27:32.034 --> 27:35.818
–Let's go! Move!
–All of you, out!

28:10.740 --> 28:15.817
Look. Even in defeat, they still know
how to march with pride.

28:29.968 --> 28:33.503
Hey, you! Hey, you!

28:33.763 --> 28:37.132
That's right,
you stupid Kraut bastards!

28:37.350 --> 28:38.809
That's right!

28:39.060 --> 28:42.761
Say hello to Ford!
And General fucking Motors!

28:43.023 --> 28:46.723
You stupid fascist pigs!
Look at you!

28:46.943 --> 28:49.648
You have horses.
What were you thinking?

28:49.905 --> 28:52.396
That's enough, Webster.

28:52.699 --> 28:54.775
Give it a rest.

28:56.077 --> 28:59.696
Dragging our asses
halfway around the world.

28:59.956 --> 29:02.364
Interrupting our lives. For what?

29:02.626 --> 29:08.130
You ignorant, servile scum!
What the fuck are we doing here?

30:21.831 --> 30:24.832
Everyone out! Move it!

30:25.042 --> 30:30.381
1st Platoon, I want roadblocks to
shut off roads in and out of town.

30:32.341 --> 30:37.336
Send out patrols. Dog in the village,
Easy and Fox in the woods.

30:37.555 --> 30:42.632
Easy takes the northwest. Lipton?
Have 1st Platoon swing to the woods.

30:42.852 --> 30:44.097
Yes, sir. Talbert!

30:44.478 --> 30:47.479
You're not worried about an ambush,
are you?

30:47.732 --> 30:52.358
No, just in case we have
to stay here for the night.

31:11.381 --> 31:13.207
–O'Keefe.
–Sarge?

31:13.466 --> 31:17.380
–Why the hell are you so jumpy?
–I'm not jumpy, I'm fine.

31:17.637 --> 31:20.342
I can hear your heart pounding.

31:20.556 --> 31:23.926
Jesus Christ, give the kid
a break, Bull.

31:26.354 --> 31:28.145
–Hey, George.
–Yeah?

31:28.398 --> 31:31.315
This kind of remind you of Bastogne?

31:32.610 --> 31:35.362
Yeah, now that you mention it.

31:35.613 --> 31:40.359
Except there's no snow,
we got warm grub in our bellies…

31:40.618 --> 31:45.530
and the trees aren't exploding
from Kraut artillery, but yeah.

31:45.749 --> 31:49.082
–Besides that, it's a lot like Bastogne.
–Right?

31:49.336 --> 31:51.791
Bull, smack him for me, please?

31:52.005 --> 31:53.629
Thank you.

31:57.719 --> 32:01.717
Sir, your men come with me.
Let's move it.

32:04.768 --> 32:06.725
Hello?

32:13.735 --> 32:15.313
Hello?

33:48.622 --> 33:51.030
It sure is quiet.

33:53.169 --> 33:55.576
He is right, fellas.

35:10.163 --> 35:11.871
–You seen Foley?
–No.

35:12.123 --> 35:15.658
–Any of you seen any officers?
–Speak to Popeye.

35:16.753 --> 35:18.793
Seen any of the officers?

35:19.047 --> 35:22.665
Speirs is right down the street.
What's the matter?

35:22.926 --> 35:28.382
–More, have you seen any officers?
–Major Winters is right in there.

35:34.146 --> 35:36.471
Major Winters, sir…

35:36.731 --> 35:40.776
We found something out on patrol.
We came across this—

35:40.986 --> 35:44.189
What? Frank, what is it?

35:45.323 --> 35:49.452
I don't know, sir. I don't know.

37:18.542 --> 37:21.247
–Open it up.
–Yes, sir.

37:25.883 --> 37:29.928
Stand back. Give us some room here.

37:31.305 --> 37:33.631
Back. Back.

38:10.511 --> 38:14.011
–Any of your men speak German?
–No, sir.

38:15.850 --> 38:19.682
I need Liebgott. Liebgott!
Lipton, find Liebgott.

38:19.896 --> 38:22.221
Liebgott! Liebgott!

38:23.566 --> 38:28.275
–Major needs you up front, right now.
–Sure.

38:29.364 --> 38:33.064
They need care.
Give them water and rations.

38:33.326 --> 38:34.607
Grab blankets.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.196
Oh, my God.

38:39.749 --> 38:41.374
Dick?

39:30.968 --> 39:32.462
I'm sorry.

39:32.719 --> 39:34.759
Here, take some water.

39:37.307 --> 39:40.593
Jesus, Web, can you believe
this place?

39:40.853 --> 39:42.679
–No.
–My God.

39:58.579 --> 40:02.327
It's okay. It's better now.

40:10.174 --> 40:13.128
He said the guards left this morning.

40:19.433 --> 40:22.387
They burned some of the huts first.

40:24.021 --> 40:27.105
With the prisoners still in them.
Alive.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.600
Jesus Christ.

40:31.862 --> 40:34.947
Some of the prisoners
tried to stop them.

40:36.951 --> 40:39.572
Some of them were killed.

40:43.291 --> 40:47.371
They didn't have enough ammo
for all the prisoners…

40:48.462 --> 40:51.463
so they killed as many
as they could…

40:53.593 --> 40:56.000
before they left the camp.

40:58.598 --> 41:02.726
They locked the gates behind them
and headed south.

41:03.519 --> 41:08.430
–Someone in town told them about us.
–Yeah, I think so.

41:12.236 --> 41:18.109
Will you ask him what kind
of camp this is?

41:18.451 --> 41:23.030
What, why are they here?

41:32.298 --> 41:35.383
He says it's a work camp for…

41:38.012 --> 41:41.346
I'm not sure what the word means.

41:41.599 --> 41:45.514
–Unwanted, disliked, maybe?
–Criminals?

41:45.770 --> 41:48.724
I don't think criminals, sir.

41:52.235 --> 41:53.516
No.

41:55.155 --> 42:00.113
Doctors, musicians, tailors,
clerks, farmers, intellectuals.

42:00.368 --> 42:02.076
I mean, normal people.

42:08.710 --> 42:10.619
They're Jews.

42:13.423 --> 42:15.748
Poles and Gypsies.

42:31.274 --> 42:32.982
Liebgott?

42:34.486 --> 42:38.353
The women's camp is
at the next railroad stop.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.974
Hey, Babe, come here.

43:11.815 --> 43:14.852
Look at their arms.

43:17.154 --> 43:20.404
–Like cattle.
–Goddamn.

44:42.031 --> 44:43.775
O'Keefe?

44:45.910 --> 44:47.155
O'Keefe?

45:12.187 --> 45:14.429
I'm gonna call Sink.

45:15.690 --> 45:21.942
Find Speirs and figure out how
to get them some food and water.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.911
Let's go. Let's pick up the pace here.

45:37.629 --> 45:41.543
Get whatever we can
fit on the deuce and a half.

45:48.640 --> 45:51.131
Take everything. Take it all.

45:51.351 --> 45:53.143
Shut up!

45:53.645 --> 45:57.263
Check the back.
Shut up!

46:02.195 --> 46:05.280
I said shut up, you Nazi fuck!

46:06.742 --> 46:09.778
You're not a Nazi?
My mistake, you prick.

46:10.037 --> 46:11.495
Are you a human?

46:11.747 --> 46:15.875
Or are you gonna tell me
you never smelled the stench?

46:19.296 --> 46:23.294
He says he doesn't know
what you're talking about.

46:28.555 --> 46:30.678
Bullshit.

46:45.447 --> 46:49.741
Sergeant, this is chaos.
There's plenty to go around!

46:56.125 --> 46:57.999
More water on the way.

46:58.252 --> 47:00.957
–Dick? Major Winters.
–Yes, sir?

47:03.799 --> 47:05.128
Sir.

47:07.219 --> 47:11.798
This is Dr Kent.
Doc, tell them what you just told me.

47:12.016 --> 47:16.179
We need to stop giving these men food.
They're starving.

47:16.437 --> 47:18.762
They'll eat themselves to death.

47:18.981 --> 47:22.813
Keep them in the camp
until we find a place in town.

47:23.069 --> 47:25.275
You want us to lock them up?

47:25.488 --> 47:27.864
–We got no choice.
–They'll scatter.

47:28.115 --> 47:32.445
We need them centralized
so we can supervise their treatment.

47:32.703 --> 47:36.404
–Until we find some place better—
–Colonel Sink.

47:37.166 --> 47:39.325
–Let's get it done.
–Yes, sir.

47:39.585 --> 47:42.539
I don't like it any more
than you guys.

47:43.798 --> 47:47.001
General Taylor?
Bob Sink, 506.

47:47.260 --> 47:51.304
Sir, we're at Landsberg,
the other side of Buchloe.

47:51.556 --> 47:54.592
We found something
you ought to see, sir.

47:55.309 --> 47:57.765
I can't tell them that, sir.

47:58.479 --> 48:00.887
You got to, Joe.

48:05.111 --> 48:06.605
Yes, sir.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.283
Grant, Christenson.

48:14.537 --> 48:18.998
These prisoners have to be
put back in the camp immediately.

49:27.319 --> 49:30.937
I'm staying in the only dry house
in Germany.

49:31.114 --> 49:33.866
Thought you weren't drinking the local.

49:34.034 --> 49:35.113
Yeah, well…

49:36.703 --> 49:38.779
Heard from Division.

49:40.582 --> 49:44.366
Been finding camps like this
all over the place.

49:45.879 --> 49:49.794
Seems the Russians liberated one
a lot worse.

49:50.175 --> 49:55.051
–Worse?
–Yeah. Apparently.

49:55.305 --> 49:59.932
Ten times as big.
Execution chambers. Ovens.

50:01.603 --> 50:04.723
For cremating all the bodies.

50:05.858 --> 50:07.649
Jesus.

50:08.277 --> 50:11.444
Locals claim they never knew
about the camp.

50:11.655 --> 50:13.564
They say we exaggerate.

50:13.824 --> 50:18.320
Well, they're gonna have
a hell of an education tomorrow.

50:18.579 --> 50:21.663
General Taylor declared martial law.

50:21.874 --> 50:27.628
Ordered every able-bodied German
14 to 80 to bury the bodies tomorrow.

50:27.880 --> 50:31.794
–10th Armored will supervise cleanup.
–What about us?

50:32.009 --> 50:34.381
We head out for…

50:34.637 --> 50:39.844
Thalem tomorrow, 1200 hours.

51:05.001 --> 51:09.461
–Kerchief, sir?
–What? No, thanks.

51:12.508 --> 51:15.509
Move along. Over there.

52:12.068 --> 52:13.812
Don't stop.

52:14.571 --> 52:17.109
You too. Come on.

53:13.547 --> 53:15.670
Hitler's dead.

53:16.800 --> 53:20.584
–Holy shit.
–Shot himself in Berlin.

53:21.096 --> 53:25.426
–Is the war over, sir?
–No.

53:27.811 --> 53:30.385
We have orders to Berchtesgaden.

53:30.606 --> 53:33.690
Why? The man's not home.

53:35.110 --> 53:39.772
Should've killed himself 3 years ago.
Saved us a lot of trouble.

53:40.866 --> 53:43.653
Yeah, he should've.

53:45.621 --> 53:48.159
But he didn't.

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
