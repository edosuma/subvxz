00:01.085 --> 00:02.666
Previously on Farscape:

00:02.753 --> 00:07.167
Pilot:
I am as concerned about Zhaan's
welfare as you, Commander.

00:07.258 --> 00:11.297
I simply thought you'd like to
see this before it went away.

00:11.387 --> 00:13.503
Crichton:
Wormhole. Prepare to
launch my module.

00:13.598 --> 00:15.680
There's a ship approaching.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.434
What the hell?

00:20.521 --> 00:21.727
Ruptures everywhere!

00:21.814 --> 00:23.099
Moya is frelled!

00:23.191 --> 00:25.307
Alien penetration of our vessel!

00:25.401 --> 00:27.938
I am Pathfinder Neeyala.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.065
This region of space...

00:30.156 --> 00:33.319
I cannot function under
the bombardments.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.741
We have ricocheted into
the distorted region

00:35.828 --> 00:38.911
that divides a wormhole from
normal space time.

00:38.998 --> 00:40.204
How do we get the ships apart?

00:40.291 --> 00:42.998
Is your Phaztillon Generator
the key?

00:43.085 --> 00:44.074
Yes.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.580
Rygel, what did you do?!

00:45.671 --> 00:47.081
You opened it!

00:47.173 --> 00:48.333
What's your name?

00:48.424 --> 00:50.335
Joolushka Tunai Fenta Hovalis.

00:50.426 --> 00:52.917
How long have I been
in this chamber?

00:53.012 --> 00:54.627
22 cycles.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.260
( piercing scream )

00:58.351 --> 01:02.390
I need empirical information
about our position in
the wormhole.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.186
Would you help?

01:04.273 --> 01:05.934
Wormhole.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.982
Normal space.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.355
What are we doing here?

01:10.446 --> 01:12.107
It's only collecting images.

01:12.198 --> 01:14.860
I think wormholes blind him.

01:17.954 --> 01:24.245
The creature you have seen
exists exclusively inside
wormholes.

01:24.335 --> 01:28.374
Crichton:
It's amazing the number of
species picked up by Neeyala's gizmo.

01:28.464 --> 01:31.956
It's possible to separate
both ships, but only
one will survive.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.291
We have to pick which one.

01:33.386 --> 01:36.924
I do not enjoy sending
you to your death.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.471
These creatures, I will
distract them.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.891
They must not know
your true mission.

01:42.979 --> 01:43.843
Frell!

01:43.938 --> 01:45.098
We will abandon Moya.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.646
Pilot, | wish you
were going with us.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.780
(hissing)

01:56.867 --> 01:58.368
(gasps )

01:58.452 --> 01:59.988
(hissing)

02:00.705 --> 02:02.366
(grunts)

02:02.456 --> 02:04.412
And now on Farscape...

02:07.503 --> 02:09.243
(hissing)

02:12.883 --> 02:15.169
Winona, don't fail me now.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.761
( pants )

02:20.808 --> 02:22.173
(grunting)

02:24.395 --> 02:25.384
Crap.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.312
I'm telling you, Aeryn,
it was from Earth.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.230
A television transmission.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.650
What, you mean, like that
Yoda from Dagobah?

02:32.737 --> 02:34.273
No, no, no, no. Three Stooges.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.228
(whoob whoob whoob whoob )

02:36.324 --> 02:38.531
Well, whatever was in there,
it's not any use to us now.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.482
Do you know what this means?
-No, I don't.

02:40.578 --> 02:44.196
It means that some part of this
wormhole is 10,20, 30,
40 light years

02:44.290 --> 02:45.996
at most away from Earth.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.165
It's doable. I could get home.

02:48.252 --> 02:51.210
Amidst our misfortune,
I'm pleased for you, John.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.460
Yes. I know.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.333
Selfish.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.211
(rumbling)

03:01.098 --> 03:02.429
( clears throat)

03:04.143 --> 03:05.428
Forget it.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.476
Where is Neeyala's injured
crew member?

03:08.564 --> 03:09.849
What are you talking about?

03:09.940 --> 03:11.646
Well, this is their blood.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.224
No, serpent blood.

03:13.319 --> 03:16.106
No, no, this is Neeyala's
species blood, John.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.528
Zhaan, there was no one here.

03:17.615 --> 03:21.199
What about that crew member
who died?

03:21.285 --> 03:23.196
Lost a limb during Starburst.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.118
Could the serpent
have done that?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.822
Well possibly, but why
would they lie?

03:27.917 --> 03:29.327
Yo, both of you.

03:29.418 --> 03:35.004
Even if Mr. Wiggles did chew
on that guy, there was
no one here.

03:35.091 --> 03:37.798
Their Phaztillon Generator.
What does it do?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.672
lt alters the phase
physicality of an object.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.174
Conceivably.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.256
We wouldn't be able to see it.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.850
Invisible.

03:53.943 --> 03:57.151
I grow weak, Neeyala.

03:59.824 --> 04:06.366
They must continue to believe
that their Leviathan
deteriorates faster than it is.

04:06.455 --> 04:10.744
Even the remotest hope will
cause them to rally to her.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.292
(rapid vibrating sounds)

04:23.931 --> 04:27.298
Shut down their thermal
condensers.

04:27.393 --> 04:32.387
Losing ability to regulate
temperature should convince
them to abandon ship.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.857
(computer bleeping )

04:33.941 --> 04:36.603
I will do what needs
to be done,

04:36.694 --> 04:40.357
including destroying them,
if I must.

04:46.287 --> 04:49.154
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:49.248 --> 04:52.740
I got shot through a
wormhole... In some distant
part of the universe...

04:52.835 --> 04:54.166
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:54.253 --> 04:56.164
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:56.255 --> 04:59.213
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.665
If you can hear me...
Beware.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.750
If I make it back...
Will they follow?

05:02.845 --> 05:05.552
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

05:05.639 --> 05:10.099
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless, for the nightmares
I've seen.

05:10.186 --> 05:12.222
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

05:12.313 --> 05:15.020
Not show them...
You exist...

05:15.107 --> 05:18.816
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:55.064 --> 05:56.179
(steam rising )

05:56.273 --> 05:58.264
There's no way to tell if
this is sabotage.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.190
Rygel:
Doesn't matter anymore
if it is.

06:00.277 --> 06:04.270
Moya's frelled and our
only option is to go
on Neeyala's ship.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.151
And what if they are
screwing us?

06:06.242 --> 06:08.699
(rumbling)

06:08.786 --> 06:11.277
Especially if they've
screwed us.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.488
Means they have the upper claw.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.119
Nah, I'm with D'Argo on this.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.199
Ooh.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.500
I think we need to know
the truth.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.624
I do not trust Crichton's
judgment.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.092
Agreed. He claims to have
seen Earth again,

06:24.176 --> 06:26.212
and I'm sure he's still
talking to Scorpius.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.213
D'Argo:
Mmm.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.215
We all know where Rygel's
loyalties lie.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.513
Sadly, Chiana's, too.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.340
(rumbling)

06:33.435 --> 06:34.561
All right.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.136
Then whether they agree or not,
we must stick to plan.

06:37.231 --> 06:40.268
First thing we do, everybody
acts normal.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.691
Don't tip them off.
Surprise maybe our only ally.

06:42.778 --> 06:46.817
If Neeyala's people aren't
sabotaging Moya, we'll
go with them.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.863
If they are, we defeat them.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.407
l'll repair some of the
nexus points...

06:50.494 --> 06:53.236
Stark:
...so they're isolated from
Moya's main systems.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.117
That way if they fry again...
-...we'll know it's them.

06:56.208 --> 07:01.248
Do you actually believe they're
using their generator to turn
themselves invisible?

07:01.338 --> 07:04.000
It would explain the sequence
of decompressions.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.173
It's geographically consistent
with someone running...

07:06.260 --> 07:07.124
...from place to place.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.301
Which leads us to the
blood in Pilot's Den.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.219
The cavern beneath
must be searched.

07:11.307 --> 07:12.797
Can we rely on you, Rygel?

07:12.891 --> 07:13.846
( groans )

07:13.934 --> 07:15.344
Can we rely on Rygel?

07:15.436 --> 07:18.303
All right, but not for you.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.137
He has been on Moya
the longest.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.847
For Moya.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.604
Keep Comms on restricted
frequency.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.811
Switch Com ms to Deka.

07:26.905 --> 07:27.655
Neeyala?

07:27.740 --> 07:29.105
Neeyala.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.279
Neeyala is mine.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.482
First thing I want...

07:31.577 --> 07:33.863
( choking ):
to get from them...

07:33.954 --> 07:35.660
is a head count.

07:35.748 --> 07:37.158
What is this?

07:37.249 --> 07:38.329
She sheds.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.909
( muffled protests )

07:46.675 --> 07:49.007
( hydraulic hatch opening )

08:01.315 --> 08:02.896
(sighs)

08:04.401 --> 08:05.902
What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.692
Well, now that we've both asked.

08:07.780 --> 08:11.568
I made 17 loops through the
wormhole, fried the organic
bits on my module.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.492
If we stick with Moya,
she makes less than one.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.318
And I'm just looking for...

08:16.413 --> 08:17.368
anything.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.492
Now, what the hell
are you doing?

08:19.583 --> 08:20.914
Formulating ideas.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.992
Formulating ideas?
Well here's an idea.

08:23.087 --> 08:26.375
Since we know nothing about
this craft, how 'bout you
stop pushing buttons?

08:26.465 --> 08:29.957
(ship humming)

08:30.052 --> 08:33.340
All right, two for two.
You're not still feeling a
little suicidal are you?

08:33.430 --> 08:35.341
Not in the least.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.809
Ah, this looks interesting.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.892
(screeching sounds)

08:42.856 --> 08:44.596
Now, what do you
suppose it does?

08:44.692 --> 08:47.149
So far, scare the crap
out of me.

08:47.236 --> 08:49.147
This ship feels somehow
familiar to me.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.820
Yeah, you know we have a crisis
going on out there?

08:51.907 --> 08:54.523
I said I was formulating ideas.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.324
I heard you.

08:56.412 --> 08:58.619
(bleeping and humming)

09:04.169 --> 09:05.955
Being on Moya...

09:06.505 --> 09:08.336
a fugitive...

09:09.341 --> 09:11.297
it's changed me.

09:11.385 --> 09:15.378
Well, if you're not feeling
suicidal, now's a bad time
for a midlife crisis.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.971
Chiana's a young woman.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.719
She needs attention.

09:19.810 --> 09:24.179
D'Argo, you were focused
on your son.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.184
It's completely understandable.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.233
Still, I neglected her.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.446
Do you know what troubles
me the most?

09:32.823 --> 09:35.235
I did my best.

09:35.325 --> 09:39.568
I did the best I could and
it wasn't enough.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.824
I still lost them both.

09:43.917 --> 09:50.208
My grandmother used to say
that life is a great wheel.

09:50.299 --> 09:53.132
Sometimes it grinds you down
in the mud and other times,

09:53.218 --> 09:55.425
it lifts you up into the light.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.798
Are we strapped to this wheel?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.175
That's a given.

09:59.266 --> 10:04.226
Point is, is that most times,
you get a second chance.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.269
Just gotta wait for the wheel.

10:06.356 --> 10:10.440
Rygel:
Aeryn, l'm nine tiers
below Pilot's Den.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.518
I've, uh, found the alien girl.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.319
Well, half of her.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.522
Looks like a serpent's
bite to me.

10:16.617 --> 10:20.735
All right. Well open the gills
on her head and carefully
remove some of the needles.

10:20.829 --> 10:21.659
Huh?

10:21.747 --> 10:23.453
What in hezmana for?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.826
I like to know my enemy.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.916
Zhaan?

10:29.087 --> 10:30.122
Zhaan!

10:30.756 --> 10:32.121
(grunting)

10:32.216 --> 10:35.800
That woman was invisible when
she was killed in Pilot's Den.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.423
Their betrayal must
be punished.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.470
Not like this, Zhaan.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.218
It won't help Moya.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.049
(rumbling)

10:46.522 --> 10:48.729
I must control myself.

10:51.109 --> 10:54.101
It was a bad trade, Zhaan.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.312
Your health for mine.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.274
Don't undervalue yourself.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.361
I'm just a solider.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.952
(sighs)

11:10.212 --> 11:12.544
Don't underestimate yourself.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.464
I'm being realistic.

11:15.551 --> 11:19.169
Don't be afraid to
understand yourself.

11:19.263 --> 11:22.096
We're not as different
as you assume.

11:22.182 --> 11:26.972
Violent past, no faith
in the future.

11:27.062 --> 11:30.975
And then a transformative
experience aboard
this very ship.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.278
My time grows short.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.229
And yours stretches before you.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.194
Use it wisely.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.034
Jool (laughing):
A living ship.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.332
I've never heard of
such a beast.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.660
Which obviously means
it can't exist.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.166
Oh, you've so figured me out.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.667
Not trying to.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.295
Be quiet please.
The gag remains an option.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.344
Is it true what the
animal said?

12:02.431 --> 12:04.262
That you're all prisoners?

12:04.349 --> 12:06.681
At some time or other, yes.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.100
( chuckles ):
Great.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.307
Just great.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.185
I take a multi-civilization
tour for my birthday

12:14.276 --> 12:17.234
and barely make it through
the first stop.

12:17.321 --> 12:18.527
I lose my deposit.

12:18.614 --> 12:20.730
My cousins get murdered.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.065
I've been frozen for 22 cycles.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.527
I've been captured by
degenerate aliens.

12:26.622 --> 12:28.237
Attacked by a huge serpent's...

12:28.332 --> 12:29.412
Dead!

12:29.499 --> 12:31.410
All of us, dead!

12:31.501 --> 12:33.492
My love dead.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.828
My dreams dead.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.754
You dead.

12:37.841 --> 12:38.876
Me dead.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.548
You dead, me dead, you dead,
me dead,

12:40.636 --> 12:42.251
you dead, me dead.

12:42.346 --> 12:46.089
Your list is short, and
unworthy of entree to this
ship of horror.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.970
Tortured by demons you
could never know,

12:49.061 --> 12:51.677
mocked by love that
will never be.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.933
( grunts )
( screams )

12:54.024 --> 12:57.107
Oh, you want to cry,
young creature?

12:57.194 --> 13:02.655
I will show you something that
will make you cry forever.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.278
(gasping and screams)

13:05.369 --> 13:08.657
(screaming continues)

13:08.747 --> 13:11.489
( crying )

13:11.583 --> 13:13.084
(static sounds)

13:13.168 --> 13:15.250
( panting )
(whimpering)

13:16.755 --> 13:17.961
It's me.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.380
(panting):
Uh, Tier Five, hamman level.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.753
A circuit blew but I
had it off-line.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.381
Someone was here. Invisible.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.383
Get ready.

13:31.061 --> 13:37.057
The privilege of working with
technology is guaranteed
by our families.

13:37.150 --> 13:41.018
Should we fail to return
this ship, they will
all be executed.

13:41.113 --> 13:45.231
Why didn't you just lie and
tell us both ships could
survive separation?

13:45.325 --> 13:49.409
We would have happily remained
here and perished with Moya.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.953
I did not wish to see you die.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.622
But I incorrectly assumed
that given the choice,

13:54.710 --> 13:56.541
you would take the
rational option.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.791
So, just to be sure, you
helped things along?

13:59.881 --> 14:04.671
You cripple a living ship and
we jump at the chance
to escape with you.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.384
I trusted you.

14:09.474 --> 14:15.515
Your feelings for Moya and
Pilot are matched by those
for our families.

14:15.605 --> 14:19.473
Allow personal passions
to cancel each other out.
What's left?

14:19.568 --> 14:21.308
Wormhole technology.

14:21.403 --> 14:25.191
Yes. Garnered at great cost,

14:25.282 --> 14:28.945
with potential beyond measure.

14:29.036 --> 14:32.199
Would you compare that with
the lives of a ship and pilot

14:32.289 --> 14:35.827
which I assure you are
doomed anyway?

14:35.917 --> 14:37.578
Moya lives, Neeyala.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.126
You misjudge her will,
and ours.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.204
Will...

14:42.299 --> 14:47.760
is a poor substitute for
beersian alloy when crushed by
astronomical tidal forces.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.258
That's still no excuse for
sabotaging Moya.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.508
Stop Kreetago.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.387
He carries no
communications device.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.218
That would give him away.

14:56.313 --> 15:00.522
He will continue his mission
until your ship is
incapacitated.

15:00.609 --> 15:03.601
Aeryn:
Then we shall find
a way to stop him.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.362
( footsteps )

15:14.706 --> 15:16.116
D'Argo:
DRDs.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.915
Find this frelling bastard.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.425
Very krell, D'Argo.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.261
How did you think of it?

15:37.312 --> 15:40.054
Watch for disruption
in the beams.

15:43.401 --> 15:44.777
D'Argo:
His needles!

15:44.861 --> 15:46.271
(Chiana screaming)

15:46.363 --> 15:47.694
Chiana:
My leg!

15:48.490 --> 15:50.651
D'Argo, I'm hit!

15:50.742 --> 15:52.198
Tourniquet.
It'll stop the poison.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.025
With what?

15:54.121 --> 15:55.076
(grunting)

15:55.163 --> 15:56.664
( screaming )

15:57.833 --> 15:59.789
He's out here somewhere.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.242
Where?

16:02.337 --> 16:04.202
Don't look. Listen.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.833
( screaming )

16:17.894 --> 16:21.102
D'Argo:
Zhaan, Chiana's got one of
their needles in her leg.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.566
Rygel, do you still have the
spikes from the alien corpse?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.231
Yes. Why?

16:25.318 --> 16:28.481
Meet me in my lab now.

16:28.572 --> 16:31.860
If this young girl dies,
I will come back for you,

16:31.950 --> 16:35.192
and I will most certainly lose
any chance I have left

16:35.287 --> 16:37.448
of meeting my goddess.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.995
(shrill electronic
tone pulses )

16:45.589 --> 16:46.874
Explain.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.377
The generator has reached
optimization phase.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.923
And what does that mean?

16:51.011 --> 16:54.674
Once activated, the power cell
will engorge a final time.

16:54.764 --> 16:59.007
And when it releases, we'll
find out if our ships are
destined to separate.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.683
Aeryn, you wanna hold off?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.431
Neeyala:
Impossible.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.764
Even now, the reactor shuts
down permanently. Listen!

17:05.859 --> 17:08.066
(shrill tone persists)

17:08.153 --> 17:10.235
My crew is dead.

17:10.322 --> 17:14.281
This is our one chance to avoid
the certainty ofjoining them.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.201
Go ahead.

17:22.292 --> 17:25.034
Neeyala:
Be aware, should our
vessels disengage,

17:25.128 --> 17:28.211
the built-in timing favors
yours being the one destroyed.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.545
How long do we have?

17:33.637 --> 17:35.423
Hard to discern with the damage.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.344
Maybe an am, not more.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.594
Ridiculous.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.185
We tried Starburst.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.930
Everybody heaved.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.727
D'Argo:
Neeyala has fixed it so that
when we separate

17:44.814 --> 17:47.226
she enters the wormhole
while Moya is ejected

17:47.317 --> 17:49.148
through the wall and
into normal space.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.569
From hetch impossible to a dead
stop. It's sub-atomic dispersal.

17:52.656 --> 17:56.945
All perfect reasons to be on her
ship, strapping in for the ride.

17:57.035 --> 18:00.323
Starburst could rotate Moya
so it's us who'll go
into the wormhole.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.699
Where she'll get ripped apart
from the stress.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.327
I've flown there, remember?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.794
We voted, Rygel.
-I didn't get to vote.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.209
I was your proxy.

18:08.296 --> 18:11.914
Pilot's in a coma, Moya is half
decompressed, nothing works.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.919
Fine! I'll kill half an arn.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.672
I want you to reconnect Pilot
to Moya's external senses.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.254
The Neural Cluster?! D'Argo,
we shredded those synapses.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.135
D'Argo:
It'll take all three of us.

18:21.226 --> 18:24.263
Splice and hook, nothing
permanent. I want to give
Pilot a chance.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.140
He's unconscious.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.596
Well do your part.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.022
He'll be awake.

18:29.109 --> 18:32.226
What if we're not done
when the time comes?

18:38.201 --> 18:39.737
Then we race to the other ship.

18:39.828 --> 18:42.194
We've gotta seal all the
chambers on the outer rim.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.325
Starburst is going to spin
us like a top.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.826
One decompression,
and we're vapor.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.954
Once secure, I'll overload Pilot
with Moya's adrenal secretions.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.160
I really blew this one, Aeryn.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.290
Not done yet.

18:51.381 --> 18:55.966
(Jool screaming)

19:06.438 --> 19:08.303
It didn't disappear.
That's new.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.356
'Cause the generator's
fully-on, right?
-Correct.

19:11.443 --> 19:16.187
We now share the serpent's
phase existence and
will until separation.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.317
It just keeps getting better.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.898
Crichton:
One-Adam-Twelve, guys.

19:19.993 --> 19:23.156
The critter's part of
our reality now.
Be careful out there.

19:23.246 --> 19:24.861
I'll try and chase it
to the outer rim.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.698
You do anything to upset
the balance that I have
set into place...

19:27.792 --> 19:29.168
Zip it, tea lady!

19:29.252 --> 19:31.038
You had your shot.
We're taking ours.

19:31.129 --> 19:34.292
You can't leave us
tied up like this.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.668
What if that thing comes back?

19:36.760 --> 19:40.127
Mmm, these are very similar
to the quellian tibor's
mating spikes.

19:40.221 --> 19:44.339
Pliable root, tensile fiber
stalk, metalline venom tip.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.549
Will she be all right?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.179
Well, I believe so.

19:47.270 --> 19:50.854
But not if Rygel hadn't secured
these other needles for
antibody serum.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.431
I heard the plan.
I'm ready to go.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.482
Uh, uh, uh!

19:55.570 --> 20:00.109
The more your blood pumps,
the more chance you'll make
a liar out of me, child.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.280
Oh!

20:03.203 --> 20:05.194
Ever my protector.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.279
It's not you who
needs protecting.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.831
It's the rest of the
universe I fear for.

20:12.170 --> 20:18.131
When I was first incarcerated
on this ship, wild and
murderous,

20:18.218 --> 20:20.800
I could not conceive how
I would survive.

20:20.887 --> 20:26.302
I heard a rumor that a Luxan
warrior was a fellow prisoner.

20:26.393 --> 20:33.231
I actually prayed that the
brute would succumb to
Hyper-Rage and kill me.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.310
How ironic is that?

20:39.989 --> 20:43.322
There is a planet out there
that will heal you.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.985
The intent is noble.

20:48.706 --> 20:52.449
The result is in the hands
of the gentle goddess.

20:58.049 --> 21:01.291
Too bad about Pilot.
I liked him.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.501
He liked you, too.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.096
Hmm?

21:04.180 --> 21:05.681
How do you know?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.756
He told me.

21:07.851 --> 21:08.840
He did?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.345
Mmm.

21:10.895 --> 21:11.759
Comms.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.140
What are you doing?

21:13.231 --> 21:14.687
Deputizing you, debutante.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.685
See those lights?
They're cycling faster.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.107
Hear that noise?
-Ow!

21:18.194 --> 21:21.482
The pitch is rising. At some
point, we're out of time.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.359
I want you to make
a judgment call.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.657
When you think it's going to
blow, you get us back here.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.449
What? I mean,
I don't know how...

21:27.537 --> 21:30.495
Look, Princess,
I know that this...

21:30.582 --> 21:33.494
trip to Kruegerland was not
on you're itinerary,

21:33.585 --> 21:36.577
but believe it or not,
I know exactly how you feel.

21:36.671 --> 21:39.162
Don't presume to know
anything about me.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.211
You hold this... steady.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.167
Be more afraid of what
you're aiming at.

21:44.262 --> 21:47.595
I've never done anything
like this before.
-None of us have.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.138
You killed my cousin!

21:49.225 --> 21:50.806
Not on purpose!

21:50.894 --> 21:54.057
He was a corpsicle and
your other cousin...

21:54.147 --> 21:57.355
He didn't last half a
minute defrosted.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.649
Then why did I survive?

21:59.736 --> 22:01.397
I don't know.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.152
You're not sick.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.104
Maybe they shanghaied you
for body parts.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.155
You're the freebie.

22:06.242 --> 22:09.780
Everything I have seen
so far is despicable!

22:09.871 --> 22:14.285
Welcome to the Federation
Starship S.S. Buttcrack!

22:15.835 --> 22:17.951
(gasping for breath )

22:18.046 --> 22:20.583
Decompression Tier Three!

22:20.673 --> 22:22.254
Zhaan:
It's rolling!

22:22.342 --> 22:24.082
Internal airtights
are giving way.

22:24.177 --> 22:27.840
Zhaan, do not enter Pilot's
access corridor!

22:29.474 --> 22:31.385
(clattering )

22:31.476 --> 22:34.468
Vent Tier Three and
Four air bladders.
Back pressure the hatches.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.177
Crichton:
I'm three, big man.
You go four.

22:36.272 --> 22:39.014
Zhaan:
We're going to be cut off.
Do something!

22:39.108 --> 22:41.565
No, blocked. Outer hull
rupture. Long way.

22:41.653 --> 22:42.733
Chiana's okay.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.071
So I heard.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.240
(relieved sigh )

22:50.328 --> 22:50.817
Serpent!

22:50.912 --> 22:55.030
( screaming )

22:55.124 --> 22:56.739
It's a good call, Rygel
on the gill darts.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.961
Anybody ever tell you how good
you are around here?

22:59.045 --> 23:01.377
Matter of fact, just recently.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.171
Whoa!

23:07.428 --> 23:09.043
Go on, keep moving.
I got a plan.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.298
Don't tell me you have a plan.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.301
What's wrong with them?
-They never work.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.757
Damn these doors!

23:13.851 --> 23:15.978
They always work.
-Not the way you detail them.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.269
Hey, look, I get results.
You're hung up on details.

23:18.356 --> 23:20.062
Your plans never work.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.276
This way.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.191
How did this ship get open?
-Aeryn, get in here.

23:24.279 --> 23:27.442
But we don't know anything
about it.
-Aeryn, just get in here.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.439
Aeryn:
This is wrong.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.695
D'Argo rubbed the damn thing.
Now get in.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.156
(mechanical beeping )

23:35.248 --> 23:37.284
( loud buzzing )

23:39.502 --> 23:41.163
Crichton, you idiot!

23:41.254 --> 23:44.166
Aeryn, D'Argo found a force
field here somewhere.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.293
Just gotta find the button.

23:51.014 --> 23:52.925
"Idiot?" Ha!

23:53.016 --> 23:54.597
World class plan.

23:54.684 --> 23:57.221
Zhaan:
Why hasn't anyone vented
Tier Four's air bladders?

23:57.312 --> 24:01.055
Zhaan, uh, sorry, we ran into
a little problem here.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.481
The passageways beyond
have opened to space.

24:03.568 --> 24:05.809
There's no way I can
get to Pilot.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.690
Your excuses have failed
him again, John.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.117
That's it! All the outer
chambers are sealed.
How'd you go, Heavy D?

24:22.211 --> 24:25.374
The air bladders are completely
vented, but we don't have
enough back pressure

24:25.465 --> 24:28.002
to reverse the damage done
in Pilot's quarters.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.708
If Pilot's dead...

24:30.803 --> 24:32.668
Yes. We're out of here.

24:32.764 --> 24:35.346
Aeryn, it's all you now.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.230
Link number four...

24:53.701 --> 24:55.908
open to space.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.820
Only one more to go.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.072
Jool, how's the timing?

25:01.167 --> 25:02.623
I'm not sure.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.416
Do better.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.369
Faster... maybe.

25:06.464 --> 25:09.706
Approximately one
third increase.

25:09.801 --> 25:12.008
Geometrically building.

25:14.931 --> 25:17.593
The alien says I'm right.

25:17.684 --> 25:21.142
Aeryn:
Third level in is compromised.

25:21.229 --> 25:24.221
Like the last two.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.772
l beseech your wisdom.

25:26.859 --> 25:32.024
Hatale. I entreat your spirit.

25:32.115 --> 25:36.324
Hatala. I petition your mercy.

25:38.287 --> 25:42.246
The gentle are stricken.
The kind are helpless.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.746
The silent uncounted.

25:45.837 --> 25:49.079
I'm approaching Pilot's Den.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.334
Even as a Tenth Level Pa'u,

25:51.426 --> 25:54.463
I am weary, and without
resources.

25:55.763 --> 26:01.303
Oh, goddess of all things holy,
hear my soul.

26:01.394 --> 26:05.262
This gentle ship is pledged to
my care, and I am powerless.

26:08.776 --> 26:13.110
Though I am but a mote
upon your winds,

26:13.197 --> 26:16.655
grant me one supplication.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.909
Ask anything in return.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.496
Just spare them their lives.

26:28.588 --> 26:32.376
The seal has held. The air is
thin, but it is breathable.

26:32.467 --> 26:33.331
Yes!

26:33.426 --> 26:34.666
( soft exclamation )

26:34.761 --> 26:36.297
Yatsa!

26:38.556 --> 26:40.421
Thank you.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.765
Thank you.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.309
Thank you.

26:45.396 --> 26:46.977
Aeryn:
We're gonna try this.

26:47.064 --> 26:50.272
I'm gonna need Moya's
adrenal secretions pumping
on my command.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.644
Just tell me when.

26:51.736 --> 26:53.226
So, we're agreed?

26:53.321 --> 26:54.401
One shot.

26:54.489 --> 26:55.444
. #21,.

26:55.531 --> 26:56.441
. #21,.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.193
. #21,.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.899
You shouldn't be up.

26:59.994 --> 27:02.576
These hands can wire... wire a
whole lot of neural cluster.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.790
(grunt)
Get me there.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.497
Time?

27:07.210 --> 27:09.075
Fractionally faster.

27:09.837 --> 27:10.747
John?

27:10.838 --> 27:11.748
Yeah?

27:11.839 --> 27:14.546
Why is this ship so important?

27:14.634 --> 27:17.467
Still worried about your
parents after 22 cycles?

27:17.553 --> 27:18.588
Yes.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.670
That's how we feel about Moya.

27:20.765 --> 27:22.471
She raised us.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.935
Bravo, bravo.

27:26.229 --> 27:27.389
Magnificent.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.892
Encore! Encore, John.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.474
John Crichton was riveting in
the role of cheerleader,

27:33.569 --> 27:37.403
rallying his comrades in the
aid of the stricken ship he had
earlier betrayed.

27:38.491 --> 27:41.107
That's my Dad's tux.
Take it off.

27:41.202 --> 27:44.820
This is not mine.
This is not my tux.
-You can choose the venue, John, but I'm going to make sure

27:44.914 --> 27:46.654
Yeah!

27:46.749 --> 27:49.161
Macon. Georgia.

27:49.252 --> 27:52.369
Macon, Georgia, on the
way to Lauderdale.
-Co|lege spring break... Hitchiking...

27:52.463 --> 27:54.328
This is the truck stop.
-To see the strippers in
Fort Lauderdale.

27:54.423 --> 27:57.711
Hey, yo, yo, no!
You do not enter my reality.

27:57.802 --> 27:59.884
You do not talk to me
in my reality.

27:59.971 --> 28:02.428
If I want you, I'll call.
Those are the rules.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.096
Unacceptable.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.471
And I suggest you sue
for peace now.

28:07.562 --> 28:09.473
Your distractions are many,

28:09.564 --> 28:11.850
while I'm totally dedicated to
getting a measure of freedom.

28:11.941 --> 28:14.683
No more dumpsters, John.

28:16.195 --> 28:20.279
Tabled. What do you want?

28:20.366 --> 28:23.153
You might fool them with
your rah-rah,

28:23.244 --> 28:28.159
but I know the disappointment
of letting Neeyala's ship
be destroyed.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.581
Yeah, well, you can't have
everything you want.

28:30.668 --> 28:33.660
I'll figure out wormholes
by myself.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.171
Green Chevy.
I had one of those.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.749
It's not too late to change
the outcome.

28:39.844 --> 28:42.085
Oh, you know everything
about me.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.339
Do you wanna make a point?

28:43.431 --> 28:45.638
Excellent, excellent, yes.

28:45.725 --> 28:51.436
And with familiarity, we might
develop a shorthand which will
benefit us both.

28:51.522 --> 28:53.228
Try this.

28:54.483 --> 28:59.853
You would do... well, anything
to save your ship. Anything.

28:59.947 --> 29:00.732
Make a point.

29:00.823 --> 29:03.656
Why assume less of Neeyala?

29:07.079 --> 29:09.695
Jool?! Jool!

29:16.923 --> 29:18.413
(groaning)

29:19.800 --> 29:23.634
Adrenal secretions fully
opened, Aeryn.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.387
Goddess speed.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.260
(grunting)

29:30.436 --> 29:32.176
Pilot!

29:32.271 --> 29:36.435
Come on, Pilot, feel that nice,
warm adrenaline flow
everywhere!

29:36.525 --> 29:38.265
(moaning)

29:39.236 --> 29:41.648
(sluggishly ):
Officer Sun?

29:42.323 --> 29:43.779
Hello.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.815
Hello.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.656
No. No...

29:53.668 --> 29:55.329
Wake up!

29:58.714 --> 30:00.670
Neeyala.

30:00.758 --> 30:03.124
Let's work together on this.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.335
We'll all survive.
We'll get you home.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.296
Family executed. Me to follow.

30:08.391 --> 30:10.256
Knowledge lost.

30:10.351 --> 30:11.932
No, thanks.

30:12.019 --> 30:14.852
We both defend that
which we love.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.554
You shouldn't've lied.

30:16.649 --> 30:20.767
You should not have been
in our path.

30:20.861 --> 30:24.774
And I should have listened to
Kreetago and destroyed you
when I had the chance.

30:24.865 --> 30:28.403
I have failed my crew,
and my ship.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.990
Now I will make it up to them.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.282
Don't make me shoot you.

30:36.377 --> 30:42.338
l encharged hydrostatic vapor
residue in atmospheric
suspension.

30:44.927 --> 30:47.259
One spark and we're nuclear?

30:47.346 --> 30:51.259
Meager as it is, you do
know more than any species
we're aware of.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.932
We can find a way.

30:54.020 --> 31:01.233
If my ship survives, even
without me, a beacon will
attract our flight command.

31:01.318 --> 31:06.813
If, by some unfathomable
circumstance your vessel
survives...

31:09.994 --> 31:12.326
We share a joined hull.

31:12.413 --> 31:17.703
I have just infused our beacon
into the Leviathan's
superstructure.

31:20.421 --> 31:22.252
We're going to have...

31:22.339 --> 31:24.796
another set of bad guys...

31:24.884 --> 31:27.091
chasing us across the universe?

31:27.178 --> 31:30.090
Unfortunately Commander,
not you.

31:30.181 --> 31:32.012
I don't think so.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.931
(hissing)

31:37.188 --> 31:38.598
(hissing)

31:38.689 --> 31:42.557
Hey Neeyala! You think this is
gonna get you what you want?

31:42.651 --> 31:44.983
What I want, you cannot give.

31:45.988 --> 31:48.195
(yelling)

31:48.282 --> 31:50.489
Crichton:
Jool, you nitwit!

31:54.288 --> 31:57.997
( screeching )

31:58.084 --> 32:01.292
I have never before released
my bristles to kill.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.084
Your forgiveness.

32:03.172 --> 32:04.412
( screeching continues )

32:06.759 --> 32:08.374
Melted tips?

32:09.637 --> 32:11.002
( screeching continues )

32:11.097 --> 32:12.382
Hey, what's the matter?

32:12.473 --> 32:14.304
You can't hear me?

32:20.189 --> 32:23.352
( sizzling )

32:36.497 --> 32:38.783
That's a hell of a scream.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.490
Thanks. Come on.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.246
We're almost out of time.
-Crichton, it's Aeryn.

32:43.337 --> 32:46.420
Pilot's just doing the
calculations now.
It won't be long.

32:48.259 --> 32:50.090
We're out of time, Aeryn!

32:50.177 --> 32:51.257
Just a little bit more?

32:51.345 --> 32:54.178
We are out of time!

32:55.975 --> 32:57.886
Which ones? Which ones?

32:57.977 --> 32:59.217
Stop yelling at me!

32:59.311 --> 33:02.223
The yelling starts in about
two seconds! Which ones?

33:02.314 --> 33:03.815
These. I'm pretty sure.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.855
You're sure? Be sure!

33:05.943 --> 33:08.184
I'm hurt! She hit me
in the head!

33:08.279 --> 33:10.270
What? Did you see the order?

33:10.364 --> 33:11.900
This, this, this, this, this.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.401
Yes.
-What the hell is that?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.073
Diagnostical helix.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.117
The mathematical representation
of quantum elasticity.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.785
Right, right, right,
that's good.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.579
Enough! Enough! Thank you!
-Order of nature. Hello!

33:20.666 --> 33:23.658
Over there.
(indignant yell)

33:23.752 --> 33:26.619
Guys, I got Zhaan here with me.
Where are you?

33:26.714 --> 33:28.045
On my way.

33:28.132 --> 33:29.121
We're not quitting.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.172
D'Argo? Stark?

33:31.260 --> 33:34.172
We're never going to make it,
John. We voted to stay
together, no matter what.

33:34.263 --> 33:35.719
Even Rygel?

33:35.806 --> 33:37.216
Pilot likes me.

33:37.308 --> 33:39.014
You know, I would care to say
that anything that gets me

33:39.101 --> 33:41.057
out of here alive is what
we should be doing.

33:41.145 --> 33:43.978
You are an ungrateful and
selfish woman.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.100
Please remain silent
from now on.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.353
Zhaan, none of this is going to
matter if Pilot doesn't...

33:48.444 --> 33:49.524
I am ready.

33:49.612 --> 33:50.772
Pilot, hey!

33:50.863 --> 33:52.774
Man, it's good to see ya.
How you doin'?

33:52.865 --> 33:56.528
No, no, answer that later.
We got a serious
situation here.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.655
What... What do we gotta do?

33:58.746 --> 34:05.333
Impulse data from each test of
their generator was stored in
Moya's neural circuitry,

34:05.419 --> 34:09.128
allowing me to construct
a statistical model...

34:09.215 --> 34:11.877
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
I trust you to do the math.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.003
Just tell me what we gotta do.

34:14.094 --> 34:19.885
I must initiate Starburst
approximately seven microts
after the generator is unleashed.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.933
Oh dear Chanu, please don't
let me die this way. Please.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.762
Who is that creature?

34:25.856 --> 34:27.687
That's ballast. Ignore it.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.481
How exact do we have to be?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.479
Not as close as you think.
-Aeryn.

34:31.570 --> 34:35.188
Ah, once we start spinning,
Moya's weight gives us
an advantage

34:35.282 --> 34:37.318
with the gravitational pull
of the wormhole.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.116
Then Neeyala's vessel will
be the one ejected directly
into space.

34:40.204 --> 34:44.163
Pilot, you want to try a little
manual point and shootjust
in case you fade?

34:44.250 --> 34:46.366
Yes, Commander.
-Crichton, no.
-Feel lucky?

34:46.460 --> 34:48.576
No, no, no, no, no.
I've never flown a wormhole.
I think it should be you...

34:48.671 --> 34:52.334
Aeryn, it's easy. The exits are
clearly marked and you're
better with Moya.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.211
No, John.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.338
Zhaan...

34:57.429 --> 34:59.636
I've got this.
-What's going on?

34:59.723 --> 35:04.308
Well just a guess, but
somebody's got to actually
trigger the generator.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.057
Get back.

35:08.148 --> 35:09.274
Both of you get back.

35:09.358 --> 35:11.815
No! Aeryn, Aeryn, do you
see this disco?

35:11.902 --> 35:14.234
I put it here, I'm gonna
take it away.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.562
Crichton, Aeryn, enough.

35:16.657 --> 35:20.115
You are both so good at
gauging reality.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.533
Yet, in this instance...

35:21.620 --> 35:23.952
Zhaan, there's a planet
out there.

35:24.915 --> 35:27.122
Along shot at best, John.

35:27.209 --> 35:31.327
The illness that is ravaging
my body is frighteningly
efficient.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.292
No!

35:50.691 --> 35:54.684
So while I'm still sound
of mind and spirit,

35:54.778 --> 35:56.643
I choose this path for myself.

35:56.739 --> 36:00.027
Zhaan, you're needed here.

36:00.117 --> 36:02.699
At one time, I believe I was.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.157
But then a family was born.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.413
You birthed it.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.246
We love you, Zhaan.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.121
Oh! Decompression,
decompression.

36:15.215 --> 36:17.126
Where to go, where to go,
where to go?

36:17.217 --> 36:19.344
Zhaan, it'll be easy.

36:19.428 --> 36:22.090
I'll start the generator.
I'll come across.

36:23.349 --> 36:26.182
If it is so easy, allow me.

36:26.268 --> 36:27.303
Zhaan, no.

36:27.394 --> 36:28.975
No, no.

36:29.772 --> 36:31.979
No more.

36:32.066 --> 36:37.311
If I am so needed, and
so valued and so wise,

36:37.404 --> 36:39.861
then you will honor my words.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.449
You will obey me.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.652
(agonized panting )

36:46.747 --> 36:50.035
For the longest time,
I feared physical demise,

36:50.125 --> 36:53.242
because my spiritual essence
was suspect.

36:53.337 --> 36:56.204
But now, I know I'm worthy.

36:56.298 --> 37:00.337
Now I know the transgressions
have melted from my soul.

37:00.427 --> 37:05.888
Now I know I shall meet
my goddess and be accepted
to her bosom.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.179
Sensitive D'Argo...

37:10.270 --> 37:12.522
exuberant Chiana...

37:12.606 --> 37:15.268
wise Rygel...

37:15.359 --> 37:17.566
selfless Aeryn...

37:17.653 --> 37:20.861
innocent Crichton.

37:20.948 --> 37:23.189
My children.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.899
My teachers. My loves.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.948
There is no guilt.

37:29.039 --> 37:30.119
There is no blame,

37:30.207 --> 37:33.290
only what is meant to be.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.959
Grow through your mistakes.

37:36.046 --> 37:40.506
And know that if patient,
redemption will find you.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.170
Wait for the wheel.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.801
Thank you, John Crichton.

38:12.082 --> 38:13.743
( moans very softly )

38:14.918 --> 38:16.454
iii/£5?

38:18.255 --> 38:23.375
(agonized wailing)

38:28.390 --> 38:30.221
Zhaan:
Stark...

38:32.186 --> 38:34.552
Stark...

38:34.646 --> 38:37.763
Link with me, my beautiful.

38:37.858 --> 38:40.645
Guide me to the place of rest.

38:41.653 --> 38:45.441
Meld into my spirit, Stark,

38:45.532 --> 38:50.902
so that I may share my last
moments with the man I love.

38:52.247 --> 38:57.287
Goodbye, you big, beautiful,
blue bitch.

39:18.398 --> 39:19.183
No!

39:19.274 --> 39:22.141
(all wailing)

39:26.031 --> 39:27.692
( explosion )

39:37.042 --> 39:39.249
Zhaan:
Always together.

39:40.546 --> 39:42.753
Joined as one.

39:57.521 --> 40:03.312
Peace of mind, peace of spirit,
peace of soul.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.484
Goodbye, my love.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.320
(rumbling)

40:20.794 --> 40:23.752
Crichton:
Manual. Aeryn, you gotta
fly this baby.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.084
( screaming )

40:33.599 --> 40:35.339
(grunting)

40:39.187 --> 40:40.723
(grunting)

41:14.222 --> 41:17.714
I appreciate your
concern, Rygel.

41:17.809 --> 41:22.394
It's just that you've never
paid this much attention
to me before.

41:22.481 --> 41:23.687
(chuckling)

41:23.774 --> 41:26.516
I think maybe you
haven't noticed.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.817
I like you, Pilot.

41:28.904 --> 41:31.236
I like you a lot.

41:35.452 --> 41:38.364
And I know Zhaan did, too.

41:38.455 --> 41:42.118
Shame you didn't get to
say goodbye.

41:43.877 --> 41:47.290
When I was unconscious,
in pain, she came to me.

41:47.756 --> 41:50.293
Inside my mind.

41:51.802 --> 41:56.171
I... already miss her.

41:57.057 --> 41:59.924
Ow! Oh... wait for me.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.519
Not that way on Moya.

42:01.603 --> 42:04.265
You want to move faster,
get better shoes.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.392
Or maybe get in better shape.

42:06.483 --> 42:10.271
Do you know how much these
shoes cost, young whore?

42:10.362 --> 42:13.320
For me? Three sex acts.

42:13.407 --> 42:16.023
Probably double that for you.

42:16.118 --> 42:17.153
(grunting)

42:17.244 --> 42:19.906
You have some nerve to
talk to me that way.

42:19.996 --> 42:25.207
One of my very... very best
friends has just gone.

42:25.293 --> 42:28.626
Right now, I am nothing
but nerve.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.420
You want someone to like you?

42:41.685 --> 42:44.097
Honestly, Aeryn, you don't
have to hover over me.

42:44.187 --> 42:48.271
To be honest in return, Stark,
I'd expect you to be a
bit more upset.

42:48.358 --> 42:52.567
Well, after fifteen thousand
deaths, what's fifteen
thousand and one?

42:52.654 --> 42:55.316
The woman you loved.

43:12.883 --> 43:19.049
Those I ministerto in their
final moments are usually
resistant to the process.

43:19.431 --> 43:21.422
Not Zhaan.

43:21.516 --> 43:28.979
Imagine being so at peace,
so certain what was
next was better.

43:30.150 --> 43:32.311
She does not want us upset.

43:32.402 --> 43:35.269
She wants us to carry on
in her spirit.

43:35.363 --> 43:39.026
Positive and hopeful.

43:39.117 --> 43:40.948
And you can do that?

43:43.079 --> 43:45.161
Not always.

43:46.124 --> 43:48.740
I would appreciate you
hovering, then.

44:24.830 --> 44:26.536
( laughter)

44:28.917 --> 44:31.283
Moe:
You're in a court not in
Clancy's Pool Room. Sit down.

44:31.378 --> 44:33.539
Curly:
I'm a victim of circumstance.

44:33.630 --> 44:34.335
Who you hitting?

44:34.422 --> 44:35.252
Ow.

44:35.340 --> 44:37.331
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk-nyuk... Ooh!

44:37.425 --> 44:42.010
Why is it always the gentle
ones that pay the price for
everyone else's ambition?

44:42.305 --> 44:43.761
Hmm?

44:54.317 --> 44:56.057
(glass shattering )
