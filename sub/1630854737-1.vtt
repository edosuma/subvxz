WEBVTT

01:17.345 --> 01:19.347
My...my name
is Chloe Albright.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.715
I am a second-year
medical student.

01:22.716 --> 01:25.119
Yes, of course. Yeah.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.521
No, I just... I, um...

01:27.555 --> 01:30.090
I don't understand
this foreclosure notice.

01:31.959 --> 01:35.429
Yeah, no, I spoke to
the regional manager, actually,

01:35.463 --> 01:37.365
on...on March 25th

01:37.398 --> 01:40.100
and then again on May 17th.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.604
What?

01:44.605 --> 01:47.208
No... No, no, no. I...

01:47.241 --> 01:48.542
Yeah, no, I know that,

01:48.576 --> 01:50.744
but my student loan
got suspended

01:50.778 --> 01:54.382
and my dad's life insurance,
it never paid out.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.619
Why?

02:00.388 --> 02:02.323
Because suicide isn't covered.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.728
Look, um...

02:07.761 --> 02:12.132
This...this house is all that
my brother and I have left, OK?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.035
No.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.205
No, you...you cannot
take it from us, OK?

02:17.238 --> 02:18.706
If you evict us from our home,

02:18.739 --> 02:20.441
then we will have
nowhere else to go.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.143
Hello?

02:25.012 --> 02:26.647
Hello?

02:30.017 --> 02:31.419
Damn you.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.302
Come on, TJ. Don't ignore me.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.141
Do you know '1984'
was supposed to be,

02:54.174 --> 02:55.843
you know, like,
a cautionary tale

02:55.876 --> 02:57.177
for us average Joes?

02:57.211 --> 02:59.513
Not a...not a goddamn
instruction manual

02:59.547 --> 03:01.181
for the rich...

03:01.215 --> 03:03.451
..b-bitches that run the show.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.453
You know, I mean,
they read the book and go,

03:05.486 --> 03:07.288
"Hey, th-th-these
are some great ideas.

03:07.321 --> 03:10.358
"Let's...let's do this."

03:10.391 --> 03:11.625
Mind control for dummies.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.262
I mean, c-c-can you

03:14.295 --> 03:16.163
b-b-believe that shit?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.332
And cell phones. Cell phones.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.634
That's real b-big brother

03:20.668 --> 03:23.871
except they don't need
to brainwash us to use them.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.440
We pay for the privilege.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.542
I mean, cops, politicians,

03:28.576 --> 03:30.210
they don't protect and serve us.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.481
They protect and serve
the hard-cash overlords from us.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.016
They sell us the idea of freedom

03:36.049 --> 03:38.218
while making sure
we never get it.

03:38.252 --> 03:43.123
It's...it's all psychopaths
who say, "2 plus 2 equals 5,"

03:43.156 --> 03:45.225
who say the best we're gonna get

03:45.259 --> 03:48.296
is...is a boot in the face.

03:48.329 --> 03:51.164
Bro! Could you just
shut the fuck up?

03:51.198 --> 03:53.834
No, no, because if you ask me...

03:53.867 --> 03:56.737
Shut... Hey, give me
the fuckin' book!

03:56.770 --> 03:58.839
No more Book Club, Oprah.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.775
-Alright? Goddamn!
-Fine, fine! OK!

04:05.178 --> 04:06.680
Let's do this, man.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.083
OK.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.721
We got this.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.356
-Alright.
-No, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:15.389 --> 04:17.558
What are you doing, Book Club?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.627
You're the driver.
You're stayin' here.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.163
I... Yeah, no, I know. I, um...

04:23.196 --> 04:25.599
You know, I hate to be
the one to tell you this.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.934
I don't have a licence.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.168
You don't have
a driver's licence?

04:28.201 --> 04:29.269
-Yeah.
-Oh, holy fuck.

04:29.303 --> 04:30.704
What are we gonna do about you

04:30.738 --> 04:32.105
not having
a driver's licence right now?

04:32.139 --> 04:33.407
I...I...I don't know.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.908
-I don't know.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.044
Dude, guess I'm just gonna
have to fuckin' kill you.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.912
Whoa, whoa! OK, wait.
You said no-one was gonna...

04:38.946 --> 04:40.414
-Fuck!

04:40.448 --> 04:42.383
-Fuck you!

04:42.416 --> 04:43.884
Fuck!

04:43.917 --> 04:45.719
Dude, I could have poked
my fucking eye out!

04:45.753 --> 04:47.921
What do you think, I got
a real gun or something?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.957
No, I don't know, I don't know!

04:49.990 --> 04:51.625
OK.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.060
-Right pedal's gas.
-I know, I know.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.695
Left pedal's...
Oh, you know so fucking much?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.263
But you don't have
a driver's licence.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.198
Yes, I know, I know. I just...

04:58.231 --> 05:01.435
Look, I'm just... Look,
I'm still getting my cut, right?

05:01.469 --> 05:04.171
TJ, I'm only doing this
so you get your fucking cut.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.940
-You know that, right?
-Yes, I do.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.409
That's the only reason I'm here.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.877
I know.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.579
Thanks.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.648
Seriously, we...we, you know...

05:14.682 --> 05:16.617
..be...we'd be dead
without you, so...

05:16.650 --> 05:18.085
-I got you.
-Yeah.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.320
You just...keep it runnin'.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.755
I know.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.726
-Just be careful, OK?
-Yeah.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.495
-Alright?
-Alright.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.130
Right pedal, gas.
Left pedal, brake.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.665
Brake. Yeah, I know.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.941
Less than a minute, alright?

05:40.974 --> 05:42.943
Yeah, just hurry, OK?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.193
Alright.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.596
Alright.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.532
Right pedal... Right.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.811
-Oh! Shit!

06:17.845 --> 06:20.180
-Let's go!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.883
Start the car!

06:22.916 --> 06:24.718
Hey, you punk!

06:26.086 --> 06:27.488
-Go!

06:27.521 --> 06:28.722
-Come on!
-Just start the car!

06:28.756 --> 06:30.858
-Start the fucking car!
-Get out of here!

06:52.212 --> 06:53.714
Hello?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.152
Hello?

06:59.186 --> 07:00.420
Chloe, it's me.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.055
-Can you let me in?
-Oh.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.093
TJ. Hi... Whoa.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.501
-Fuck! Ow!
-Hold still, hold still.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.503
-Shit, Chloe! God.
-Yeah, shit is right.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.170
What the hell were you thinking?

07:17.204 --> 07:20.641
No...no-one
was supposed to get hurt.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.877
OK? Ross said that it...

07:23.911 --> 07:27.715
Wait... Ross?

07:29.149 --> 07:31.685
TJ, you...you pulled
this shit with Ross?

07:31.719 --> 07:33.687
I couldn't do it alone.

07:33.721 --> 07:37.424
I've told you to stay away
from him so many times.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.794
You dated him for three years.
You know he's not a bad guy.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.362
He's bad news, TJ.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.099
-Fuck!
-It's out.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.801
Chloe!

07:50.270 --> 07:52.606
He's not a bad guy, OK?
He just...

07:54.808 --> 07:56.043
Things got away from him.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.578
Things didn't get away from him.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.313
He pushed them away.
We can't be like him, TJ.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.983
-You cannot be like him.
-He's dead.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.688
I think. I don't...

08:09.322 --> 08:10.858
I don't know.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.701
It's not easy...

08:22.202 --> 08:23.637
..for me, Chloe, OK?

08:23.671 --> 08:25.438
You know, you handle all...

08:25.472 --> 08:28.175
You think that this
is easy for me?

08:29.442 --> 08:33.480
No. No, I did this for you, OK?

08:34.882 --> 08:36.784
-What?
-OK, I...

08:37.818 --> 08:41.755
I know you're having
trou-trouble with tuition.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.490
And...

08:43.523 --> 08:45.158
..now they're gonna
take the house.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.094
And I...I just
wanted to help, OK?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.696
I know how this is
gonna affect you.

08:48.729 --> 08:49.963
I just...I just want to help.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.966
I couldn't just st-stand by...

08:55.035 --> 08:57.004
..and let you go
through this, you know?

08:58.405 --> 08:59.907
No, I know.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.878
I know, OK? I fucked up.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.580
I fucked up.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.253
Another one bites the dust.

09:16.189 --> 09:20.060
Yeah, get the coroner
and his meat wagon here ASAP.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.195
I don't want the locals
looking at this dead hoodlum

09:22.229 --> 09:23.631
bleeding in the street.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.034
You get a plate
on our wheel man?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.501
-No plate, Sheriff.
-Description?

09:28.535 --> 09:30.337
-Ski masks.
-Sheriff.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.205
We've got a flaming car
out on Mission Road.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.141
Sounds like a match
for your getaway vehicle.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.743
Huh.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.377
Well, ain't that a thing?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.813
Looks like our wheel man's

09:39.847 --> 09:41.548
the brains
of this cluster fuck.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.817
OK, I'm going to
ask you some questions, yeah?

09:43.851 --> 09:45.185
Mm-hmm.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.020
-TJ?
-Yeah, yeah.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.522
I need you to be
100% honest with me, OK?

09:53.293 --> 09:55.028
OK, did anybody see you?

09:55.062 --> 09:58.766
No. We...we wore
masks and gloves.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.835
OK, good. Uh, did you tell
anybody about this?

10:01.869 --> 10:03.937
No, no, I swear.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.605
And the car? What about the car?

10:05.639 --> 10:08.375
I ditched it.
I...I set it on fire.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.344
Fire? That's smart.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.413
OK, um... Whose car was it?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.882
Stolen.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.885
OK, then, you're fine.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.888
You're gonna be fine.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.790
You're gonna...
you're gonna stay here with me.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.025
Right? You're gonna...
you're gonna keep a low profile.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.195
They have absolutely no reason
to think that you would...

10:31.631 --> 10:34.034
-What?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.568
What?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.538
Ross's phone.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.273
What about Ross's cell phone?

10:40.307 --> 10:43.310
I...I...
It's on...it's on him.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.145
It's on him and I forgot.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.814
I just...

10:46.847 --> 10:49.049
It's...it's...

10:49.082 --> 10:53.320
You planned a robbery

10:53.353 --> 10:55.422
on a fucking iPhone?

10:57.357 --> 11:00.227
-Are they gonna go easy on me?
-Are they gonna go easy on you?

11:00.260 --> 11:02.462
TJ, it is an armed robbery
where somebody ends up dead.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.965
TJ, that is 25 to life.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.567
But, you know,
I...I was only the driver.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.636
You were only the driver?
You think that matters to them?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.071
That doesn't matter to them.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.673
And you going to jail,
that breaks my promise to Mom.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.275
What are we gonna do?

11:19.046 --> 11:21.114
We have to get the phone.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.784
How?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.055
Just give me five minutes.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.296
Out here,
regional budgets have been cut

11:36.329 --> 11:38.431
and so the morgue
is pretty much a one-man shop.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.768
And the sheriff's department,
it's overworked, understaffed.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.602
The chief has been cracking down
on local meth-heads.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.104
According to the news,
about an hour

11:44.137 --> 11:45.472
before they
brought Ross's body in,

11:45.505 --> 11:47.474
a girl was killed
when her car hit a tree.

11:47.507 --> 11:50.377
So we know there are at least
2 bodies in there, 1 coroner.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.980
Buys us some time to get inside
and find Ross's phone.

11:53.013 --> 11:56.149
Won't...won't his phone
be with the cops?

11:56.183 --> 11:57.450
Not out here.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.152
Ross and all he had on him

11:59.186 --> 12:00.620
will be processed
at the morgue first.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.955
His clothes, his phone,

12:01.989 --> 12:03.156
everything will be
bagged and tagged

12:03.190 --> 12:04.524
and locked in the evidence room

12:04.557 --> 12:06.159
for the sheriff
to claim in the morning,

12:06.193 --> 12:08.295
along with the coroner's
autopsy report.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.064
Walk the perimeter,
look for access.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.901
Yeah, and I'm sure they have
a back door for graverobbers.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.711
Hello?

12:24.744 --> 12:27.881
I...I'm a friend
of the girl who was in the...

12:27.915 --> 12:29.316
..the car accident tonight.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.852
I was hoping that
I could see her

12:31.885 --> 12:34.187
for one last goodbye.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.764
-Oh, fuck!

12:44.798 --> 12:47.567
-Oh, fucking hell!

12:49.602 --> 12:52.772
Cujo's out back
and there's cameras everywhere.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.075
-Fucking Fort Knox.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.278
Hello?

12:58.311 --> 13:00.147
This whole place
is locked down.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.583
The only way
we're getting in

13:03.616 --> 13:05.752
is through a fucking
body bag, you know?

13:10.057 --> 13:12.559
-What if that can be arranged?
-Huh? What?

13:12.592 --> 13:15.195
Do you still score Adderall
off that vet tech?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.130
Yeah, yeah, you know,
it helps me focus.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.798
I need you to call her.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.337
Hey.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.908
Whoa. Who is this?

13:27.941 --> 13:31.811
Oh, this is my...my sister.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.581
She...she's cool, so...

13:34.614 --> 13:36.283
Hey.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.185
Uh-huh.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.925
-It's 50 for the Addy.
-And the propofol?

13:44.958 --> 13:46.493
Listen, I got it.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.628
But I need you to understand
that this shit is...

13:48.661 --> 13:50.563
A sterile,
nonpyrogenic emulsion,

13:50.597 --> 13:52.265
full name diisopropylphenyl.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.466
It's used in the induction

13:53.500 --> 13:55.568
and maintenance
of sedation anaesthesia,

13:55.602 --> 13:58.405
and it works
by dramatically slowing down

13:58.438 --> 14:00.440
the recipient's brain
and nervous system.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.044
I study criminology
and forensic medicine.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.148
150.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.017
Come on. No deals today?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.185
Shh. Here.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.357
So I hope y'all know
what y'all doin'.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.160
That shit killed
the King of Pop.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.965
Yeah.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.500
OK. Now what?

14:28.501 --> 14:30.003
Now it's time to die.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.210
How does this,
uh, work exactly?

14:37.244 --> 14:38.645
I inject it.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.180
A few seconds later,
I'll be unconscious.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.681
The propofol slows
my heart rate

14:41.714 --> 14:44.517
and brain activity
to almost nothing.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.119
I'll still be alive.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.321
I just have a bad feeling
about this, you know?

14:48.355 --> 14:50.958
TJ,
it is after nine o'clock, OK?

14:50.991 --> 14:53.360
By the morning, the sheriff is
going to be in that morgue,

14:53.393 --> 14:55.162
hearing the results
of Ross's autopsy

14:55.195 --> 14:56.663
and collecting his belongings.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.132
How long after that do you think
it is going to take

14:59.166 --> 15:01.701
until you are in custody?

15:05.572 --> 15:07.975
Once I'm unconscious, you're
just gonna wait 30 minutes, OK?

15:08.008 --> 15:09.709
What? Why?

15:09.742 --> 15:12.879
Because I have to be cold
when they find me.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.215
Otherwise, they'll...
they'll try to resuscitate.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.885
Look, TJ, you are going
to wait 30 minutes.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.521
You are then going to call 911
and you are going to say

15:21.554 --> 15:23.756
that you saw a girl
OD in the underpass

15:23.790 --> 15:25.425
and that you think
she might be dead,

15:25.458 --> 15:27.827
but you aren't gonna give
a name or anything.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.496
You understand that?

15:29.529 --> 15:34.201
Yes, but as-assuming
this works,

15:34.234 --> 15:36.003
how are you gonna get out?

15:36.036 --> 15:39.039
Let's just worry about
getting me in first, yeah?

15:39.072 --> 15:41.708
Look, I, um...
I should do this.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.011
OK? Look, this was...
this was...

15:44.044 --> 15:45.512
No, no, this was my mess-up.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.214
Alright? Let me fix it.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.417
You have any run-ins
with the local sheriff lately?

15:54.587 --> 15:56.423
They won't remember me.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.736
-Hey.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.138
Hey.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.242
You know I love you.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.110
Don't. Don't do that.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.262
OK.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.198
Hey, you alright?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.134
OK, you gotta go.
You gotta get out of here.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.706
OK.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.442
Love you.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.810
It's alright.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.985
Oh!

18:58.638 --> 18:59.772
OK.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.175
OK.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.187
Oh...

19:15.922 --> 19:17.490
Oh, shit! Sorry.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.442
Oh!

23:45.291 --> 23:47.193
Oh, God!

25:02.802 --> 25:04.270
OK.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.222
Shit, shit, shit...

25:56.255 --> 25:57.289
OK.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.689
Hey, you gonna
have Mannix waiting all day?

27:02.722 --> 27:04.056
Come on already.

27:54.807 --> 27:57.910
Yo, I'm here
for the seance.

27:57.944 --> 28:00.847
No? No funnies today?

28:02.648 --> 28:05.451
Man, this is no way
to spend your day.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.120
You got a family,
dinner waiting for you at home?

28:08.154 --> 28:10.322
Or are you too busy breakin'
bread with the dead, huh?

28:10.356 --> 28:12.624
Come on, man!

28:12.658 --> 28:14.660
What do you do for
a good time around here?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.362
You got a girl back there
or something?

28:17.363 --> 28:19.832
You know, every time
you hand me one of these,

28:19.866 --> 28:22.368
I feel like we're
going to the beach.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.837
Don't you wish there was
a sixpack in here, huh,

28:24.871 --> 28:26.973
some Kool-Aid,
some chicken salad sandwiches?

28:27.006 --> 28:30.042
Ooh, there she is.

28:30.076 --> 28:33.179
Hey! Take it easy.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.748
I'm just checking out
the merchandise.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.318
Sheesh!

28:41.253 --> 28:43.322
Oh, shit, I almost forgot.

28:43.355 --> 28:47.626
About that guy in L.A.
looking for the liver?

28:47.659 --> 28:50.129
Thank God for alcoholic
movie producers, huh?

28:51.563 --> 28:54.066
Alright, well, let me know
if that works out

28:54.100 --> 28:56.035
and you might see me
again tonight.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.004
Lucky fuckin' me.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.176
Oh, God.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.949
You stupid asshole.

31:36.862 --> 31:37.863
Ross!

31:37.896 --> 31:39.465
Hey, hey, hey.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.333
Shh! Shh! Shh!

31:41.367 --> 31:44.070
Shh, shh! Hey. Shh, shh, shh!

31:44.103 --> 31:45.671
Shh, shh!

31:47.706 --> 31:50.242
It's Chloe. It's OK.

31:50.276 --> 31:52.078
-What the...?

32:02.188 --> 32:04.023
Why the hell
are you not in a hospital?

32:04.056 --> 32:05.824
I am.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.426
Who did this to you?

32:07.459 --> 32:10.029
Was it the...
the guy with the keys?

32:10.062 --> 32:11.530
Was it him? Yeah?

32:11.563 --> 32:13.832
OK, was there anybody else?

32:13.865 --> 32:16.335
Ross, have you seen
anybody else?

32:20.306 --> 32:22.274
What the fuck is going on?

32:23.375 --> 32:25.044
Chloe...

32:25.077 --> 32:27.046
-Shh, shh!
-What are you doing here?

32:29.881 --> 32:33.185
You dipshits planned
a robbery on an iPhone.

32:33.219 --> 32:34.786
I know.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.589
If I don't get it,
then TJ's going to jail.

32:39.891 --> 32:41.393
It's not safe here.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.694
What?

32:42.728 --> 32:46.898
It's not safe here.

32:49.935 --> 32:51.270
OK.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.440
TJ's going to freak out,
he finds out you're alive.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.375
I'm going to get
to the evidence room

32:56.408 --> 32:58.810
and then I'm gonna get you
the hell out of here.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.046
-OK.
-OK, good.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.747
You know where the keys are?

33:02.748 --> 33:04.283
Yeah, I know where they are.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.086
I'll be back.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.914
The order came through

36:22.948 --> 36:24.616
for our man in L.A.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.485
Mannix will be by in an hour.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.512
Ross? OK. Hey!

36:53.545 --> 36:55.647
I need you to get up, OK?

36:55.681 --> 36:57.849
Ross? Ross!

36:59.017 --> 37:01.387
OK. Hurry.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.988
I know. Look.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.424
I need you to come with me. OK?

37:06.558 --> 37:07.893
Shit, I'm sorry.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.128
-I'm sorry! Shh, shh!

37:12.197 --> 37:13.665
OK.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.335
I have the keys.

37:16.368 --> 37:19.571
You need to get up
with me right now, OK?

37:19.605 --> 37:20.972
-Come on.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.141
-I know it hurts. Shh! Shh!

37:25.677 --> 37:27.145
OK. I got you.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.080
Good job. Ready? Almost there.

37:29.114 --> 37:30.349
Just lean onto me.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.384
-I know. Shh, shh!

37:32.418 --> 37:34.820
-I got you...

37:34.853 --> 37:36.254
-OK, you alright?
-Yeah.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.256
-Shh!

37:38.290 --> 37:39.558
-OK?
-Alright.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.860
We need to go.
We need to go, OK?

37:41.893 --> 37:43.529
-I know it hurts.

37:43.562 --> 37:44.896
They cut you.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.165
-Hey, hey.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.035
-Ross.
-Oh!

37:50.068 --> 37:51.803
Ross, would you look at me?

37:53.038 --> 37:54.706
We have to go.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.443
-Now.
-OK.

37:57.476 --> 38:01.146
-OK? Come on. I got you.
-Fuck!

38:20.165 --> 38:22.968
OK.
You see the door?

38:23.001 --> 38:25.103
We're going to get
through it, OK?

38:25.136 --> 38:26.772
-OK, go. Right there.
-Oh! OK, OK, OK.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.607
OK.

38:30.742 --> 38:31.910
OK.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.054
-Oh, God.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.256
Fuck.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.267
Chloe, what did they do to me?

39:29.300 --> 39:31.570
They took your kidney, Ross.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.541
They what?

39:35.574 --> 39:38.644
That's OK, though,
because you have another one.

39:38.677 --> 39:41.146
Son of a bitch.

39:42.514 --> 39:45.116
-Got it. Come on. Right now.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.352
-OK.
-OK. Shh, shh, shh, shh!

39:47.385 --> 39:49.387
OK.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.222
-Fuck!
-Shh, shh!

39:51.256 --> 39:52.824
Alright.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.048
I'll slow you down.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.917
You know you...you just
gotta go, right?

40:18.950 --> 40:20.652
-I'm not leaving.
-What?

40:20.686 --> 40:22.654
When I open this door,
you are going to run.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.422
I still need to get
into the evidence room.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.191
-OK.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.393
OK. Almost there.

40:36.201 --> 40:39.304
-Oh, shit.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.942
He sees us.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.216
-Chloe...
-Shh!

40:51.249 --> 40:52.551
Shit.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.219
He knows we're in here.

40:54.252 --> 40:56.822
-OK.
-Fuck.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.634
OK.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.906
He's coming. He's coming.

41:14.940 --> 41:18.276
Hey, hey, Chloe?
I'm...I'm sorry.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.411
I fucked up.
I'm sorry for all of it.

41:20.445 --> 41:22.581
I will stop him, OK?
You just fuckin' go.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.049
Hey.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.618
You cut the macho shit
right now, OK?

41:26.652 --> 41:29.320
You left me once. You're not
fuckin' doing it again.

41:32.524 --> 41:33.925
OK...

41:36.962 --> 41:39.497
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't have ever left.

41:39.531 --> 41:41.833
Where is it?
Last key, Ross.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.401
Here we go.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.003
We're on the last one.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.406
-I got it!

41:48.439 --> 41:49.641
Ross!

41:49.675 --> 41:51.309
No. Ross.

41:51.342 --> 41:54.279
Hey, I got the door, OK?
I need you to get up.

41:54.312 --> 41:56.281
Come on, come on.
I need you to move.

41:56.314 --> 41:59.284
OK, I need you to come.

41:59.317 --> 42:01.186
Come on.

42:01.219 --> 42:02.788
OK.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.156
Come on, Ross.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.648
Ross...

42:33.318 --> 42:35.921
Ross, Ross...

42:42.493 --> 42:44.329
I doubt
he can hear you.

42:48.499 --> 42:50.869
OK...please,

42:50.902 --> 42:52.671
please, just let us go.

42:52.704 --> 42:54.572
I won't say anything
to anybody, please.

42:54.606 --> 42:56.341
And where would you go?

42:56.374 --> 42:58.877
Back to your
rat-infested apartment?

42:58.910 --> 43:00.879
To your tent city?

43:00.912 --> 43:03.181
To your life of crime?

43:03.214 --> 43:05.250
What? No.

43:06.918 --> 43:09.721
No, that's...that's not me.

43:09.755 --> 43:11.156
Then what are you doing here?

43:11.189 --> 43:13.859
Attempting to claim that
which does not belong to you?

43:13.892 --> 43:15.894
Do you think you're
deserving of it in some way,

43:15.927 --> 43:17.195
that you've earned it?

43:17.228 --> 43:19.831
Compensation for the toils

43:19.865 --> 43:22.100
and petty grievances
that you've accrued

43:22.133 --> 43:24.903
during your time on this Earth?

43:27.773 --> 43:29.775
Maybe you feel like you got
dealt a bad hand

43:29.808 --> 43:30.942
and you should be allowed

43:30.976 --> 43:32.944
to slip a few extra aces
up your sleeve.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.713
You ever considered
getting a job

43:34.746 --> 43:38.083
or is...that completely
out of the question?

43:38.116 --> 43:40.518
This country's filled
with people like you,

43:40.551 --> 43:42.520
people who take, take, take.

43:42.553 --> 43:44.522
They don't earn. You cheat.

43:44.555 --> 43:46.725
You don't strive.
You cut corners.

43:46.758 --> 43:48.626
You take shortcuts.

43:48.660 --> 43:51.529
No, that's not me, though.

43:51.562 --> 43:53.732
Fortunately for me,

43:53.765 --> 43:58.436
you are all defined
by one undeniable truth.

43:58.469 --> 43:59.805
All that you are...

44:02.173 --> 44:05.711
..all that you've done,
all of your thoughts,

44:05.744 --> 44:09.147
your feelings, your beliefs...

44:10.615 --> 44:12.984
..your entire being

44:13.018 --> 44:15.520
is worth considerably less...

44:17.689 --> 44:19.490
..than the sum of your parts.

44:22.593 --> 44:23.661
No.

44:24.996 --> 44:26.464
No, no, no, no. Please, please.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.299
Please. OK? You're wrong.

44:28.333 --> 44:29.667
I...I am a student

44:29.701 --> 44:31.502
and I know the opportunity
I have been given.

44:31.536 --> 44:34.472
-I wanna make something out...
-What are you studying?

44:35.707 --> 44:38.844
I study...I study...
forensic medicine.

44:42.814 --> 44:44.482
That's an
underappreciated field.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.184
Yeah.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.853
Then you already know
that there are

44:47.886 --> 44:51.322
over a million dollars' worth
of assets inside of you.

44:51.356 --> 44:55.761
Kidney, heart,
liver, lungs, eyes.

44:55.794 --> 44:57.662
That's before we get
into your plasma,

44:57.695 --> 44:59.030
your bone marrow.

44:59.064 --> 45:02.667
Even your skin bears a price.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.170
You should have
valued yourself higher

45:05.203 --> 45:07.305
before you broke
into this sacred place.

45:07.338 --> 45:10.141
-I didn't have a choice.
-Of course you had a choice.

45:10.175 --> 45:11.709
Just like he had a choice.

45:11.743 --> 45:13.611
You obviously know
this young man.

45:13.644 --> 45:15.981
Caught earlier this morning...

45:17.548 --> 45:20.886
..cutting another corner,
taking another shortcut.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.622
Look, I know
what he did was wrong.

45:24.655 --> 45:26.792
I get that. I'm pissed.

45:26.825 --> 45:30.161
But he...
he does not deserve...

45:30.195 --> 45:31.997
Of course he deserves it.

45:32.030 --> 45:34.833
Who wouldn't vote
to end this wretch's life

45:34.866 --> 45:36.835
if it meant saving
a more worthy person,

45:36.868 --> 45:38.536
a person of value?

45:41.206 --> 45:43.608
You think life
is essentially fair?

45:46.211 --> 45:48.579
Well, unfortunately,
life is not fair.

45:48.613 --> 45:51.582
I know that life isn't fair.

45:51.616 --> 45:54.685
Hey, I know that!
I know that...

45:54.719 --> 45:57.856
-OK.
-And what is your excuse?

46:04.629 --> 46:06.264
My excuse?

46:07.398 --> 46:09.901
My excuse is that
the medical examiner,

46:09.935 --> 46:13.771
he determined my dad's
cause of death as suicide.

46:13.805 --> 46:17.008
But it wasn't suicide.
I know that it wasn't suicide.

46:17.042 --> 46:19.744
He suffered from PTSD,
psychotic episodes

46:19.777 --> 46:21.379
and he was heavily medicated.

46:21.412 --> 46:23.514
And then the insurance,
they cut off his medication...

46:23.548 --> 46:26.284
Ah, suicide cancelled
the insurance policy

46:26.317 --> 46:29.955
and you and Mommy
didn't get any money.

46:29.988 --> 46:31.556
Sad tale.

46:31.589 --> 46:33.058
A common one.

46:33.091 --> 46:34.860
-A victim's excuse.
-No.

46:34.893 --> 46:37.863
No, I am not
who you think I am, OK?

46:37.896 --> 46:39.297
I got into forensics

46:39.330 --> 46:41.632
because I want to help people
find the truth, like...

46:41.666 --> 46:45.703
The truth is what I say
the truth is.

46:45.736 --> 46:48.439
Your father was a pathetic loser

46:48.473 --> 46:52.110
that did the world a favour
by ending his life.

46:52.143 --> 46:55.981
And you, when you broke in here,
ended your life.

46:57.815 --> 47:01.019
You are a sick man.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.588
I'm not sick.

47:04.589 --> 47:06.124
I'm the cure.

47:11.997 --> 47:15.433
No! No! No!

47:15.466 --> 47:17.468
Please stop!

47:24.709 --> 47:26.044
Please, please, please!

47:32.317 --> 47:34.519
-Oh!

47:48.666 --> 47:51.136
It's OK, it's OK...

48:15.093 --> 48:17.395
-No, no!

48:17.428 --> 48:18.829
No!

48:31.909 --> 48:33.211
Ross...

48:41.086 --> 48:42.520
You know
this used to be

48:42.553 --> 48:44.255
the largest hospital
in the county?

48:46.024 --> 48:48.626
Now it's just me down here.

48:52.230 --> 48:56.367
And I do not like
uninvited guests.

49:31.569 --> 49:33.271
No...

49:33.304 --> 49:35.240
Please!

49:35.273 --> 49:36.541
No, please.

49:36.574 --> 49:39.044
Please, I'm sorry!
Please!

49:39.077 --> 49:40.445
Shh-shh-shh-shh!

49:42.513 --> 49:43.814
Shh, shh. It's OK, it's OK.

49:43.848 --> 49:45.316
Listen, listen, listen.

49:45.350 --> 49:48.153
Not one word.

49:52.190 --> 49:53.891
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, Dad.

49:53.924 --> 49:55.760
Mom wants to know
if you're coming home tonight.

49:55.793 --> 49:59.097
Oh, no, honey, I can't make it.
Daddy's working.

49:59.130 --> 50:00.931
Oh. We miss you.

50:00.965 --> 50:02.600
I miss you too.

50:02.633 --> 50:04.569
I'll see you
for breakfast tomorrow.

50:04.602 --> 50:06.804
Don't forget to call Brad
before school.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.439
I won't.

50:08.473 --> 50:09.607
Love you.

50:10.608 --> 50:12.177
Love you too.

50:22.553 --> 50:27.492
I don't know what you want.
I'm sorry. I'm...

50:27.525 --> 50:29.127
Thank you for that.

50:30.895 --> 50:34.199
Know that his death and yours

50:34.232 --> 50:37.135
will bring renewed life
to someone who's willing

50:37.168 --> 50:40.037
to sacrifice everything
for their beliefs

50:40.071 --> 50:41.839
and now, thanks to me,

50:41.872 --> 50:44.875
your trivial existence
will have meaning.

50:44.909 --> 50:47.044
I'm going to give your
life worth,

50:47.078 --> 50:50.381
piece by piece...

50:50.415 --> 50:52.350
..by piece.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.725
No...

52:07.925 --> 52:10.561
OK, OK, OK.

52:13.764 --> 52:16.334
OK. OK.

52:22.740 --> 52:25.676
I'm sorry, sorry.

52:28.446 --> 52:30.715
I'm sorry.

52:30.748 --> 52:32.517
OK. Alright.

52:33.518 --> 52:34.952
Yes.

52:37.288 --> 52:39.957
OK.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.632
OK.

53:00.044 --> 53:02.280
Come on. Please.

53:05.383 --> 53:06.951
Come on.

54:36.273 --> 54:37.975
Ahh!

59:04.575 --> 59:05.910
Eight...

1:00:47.411 --> 1:00:48.779
Give it to me.

1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:52.349
This is what this is all about?

1:00:53.350 --> 1:00:55.452
Some dead loser's cell phone?

1:00:55.485 --> 1:00:59.289
Just give me the fucking phone.

1:00:59.323 --> 1:01:03.460
You know, for someone who's
a scholar of forensic science,

1:01:03.493 --> 1:01:06.163
you should know a little more
about protocol procedure.

1:01:06.196 --> 1:01:10.267
We would never leave
a live firearm unattended...

1:01:11.301 --> 1:01:15.505
..which means that gun
is either unloaded...

1:01:17.641 --> 1:01:19.043
..or it's fake.

1:01:25.149 --> 1:01:27.117
-Give it to me!

1:01:27.151 --> 1:01:28.585
Oh!

1:01:39.563 --> 1:01:41.966
No... No!

1:01:42.967 --> 1:01:44.201
Damn!

1:04:09.046 --> 1:04:11.148
-Sorry...

1:04:11.181 --> 1:04:13.283
Help me.

1:04:14.284 --> 1:04:15.986
Please.

1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:18.222
I'm sorry.

1:04:19.489 --> 1:04:22.659
-Oh! Ah!

1:04:29.666 --> 1:04:32.702
-Shh, shh, shh!

1:04:42.012 --> 1:04:43.580
Oh, my God.

1:04:47.484 --> 1:04:49.319
Chloe.

1:04:49.353 --> 1:04:50.887
Can you hear me?

1:04:51.888 --> 1:04:53.423
Up here.

1:04:54.558 --> 1:04:56.893
I assume TJ is your brother.

1:04:58.828 --> 1:05:01.031
Naughty little boy, isn't he?

1:05:01.065 --> 1:05:03.500
In literature,
they refer to him

1:05:03.533 --> 1:05:05.402
as an irredeemable character,

1:05:05.435 --> 1:05:07.037
loathsome.

1:05:07.071 --> 1:05:09.606
I'm sure you disagree.

1:05:10.874 --> 1:05:13.210
I can tell
he's had his problems.

1:05:13.243 --> 1:05:15.379
Probably renders him
sympathetic in your view.

1:05:15.412 --> 1:05:17.481
But to me,
he's just a pile of dog shit

1:05:17.514 --> 1:05:18.915
on a pristine carpet

1:05:18.949 --> 1:05:20.250
and tarnishing the environment

1:05:20.284 --> 1:05:21.851
for those of us
that are hard-working,

1:05:21.885 --> 1:05:23.653
those of us
that are law-abiding

1:05:23.687 --> 1:05:24.821
and those of us

1:05:24.854 --> 1:05:26.756
that contribute.

1:05:32.196 --> 1:05:34.098
Luckily, the cell phone

1:05:34.131 --> 1:05:36.866
you've risked so much for
holds the key

1:05:36.900 --> 1:05:40.204
that will imprison
your feeble-minded brother

1:05:40.237 --> 1:05:43.440
for what's left
of his worthless life.

1:05:43.473 --> 1:05:45.742
You know what they call
someone like TJ in prison,

1:05:45.775 --> 1:05:47.277
Chloe?

1:05:47.311 --> 1:05:49.913
They call them "June bugs".

1:05:49.946 --> 1:05:52.349
Do you know why
they call them June bugs?

1:05:52.382 --> 1:05:55.252
Because they only live
for six months.

1:06:00.757 --> 1:06:03.227
But I believe you sought
to better your life.

1:06:06.563 --> 1:06:09.433
But your delinquent brother
pulled you back into this world

1:06:09.466 --> 1:06:11.768
and now you are one step away

1:06:11.801 --> 1:06:13.670
from Ross's fate.

1:06:18.642 --> 1:06:20.844
Turn yourself in to me
now, Chloe.

1:06:51.275 --> 1:06:55.412
Here she is.
Yes. Go find her.

1:07:22.806 --> 1:07:24.007
Hello?

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:25.575
TJ?

1:07:26.676 --> 1:07:28.178
Oh, Chloe, where are you?

1:07:28.212 --> 1:07:29.779
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

1:07:29.813 --> 1:07:33.183
I'm...I'm still inside.

1:07:33.217 --> 1:07:35.385
Are you alright?

1:07:35.419 --> 1:07:36.720
TJ...

1:07:36.753 --> 1:07:39.456
Look, they, uh...

1:07:39.489 --> 1:07:42.726
..they hurt people here.

1:07:42.759 --> 1:07:45.329
OK, wh-what do you mean?

1:07:46.396 --> 1:07:50.567
I don't know. It's really
hard to explain right now.

1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:52.536
-Chloe...
-TJ, I...

1:07:52.569 --> 1:07:55.472
I think I failed you.
I'm so sorry.

1:07:55.505 --> 1:07:58.208
I can't get your phone.
I tried really hard.

1:07:58.242 --> 1:07:59.776
I promise.

1:08:01.010 --> 1:08:03.713
-Are you in danger?
-No, you don't worry about me.

1:08:03.747 --> 1:08:06.316
I need you to get
the hell out of this state.

1:08:06.350 --> 1:08:07.684
Chloe, I'm not
leaving the state.

1:08:07.717 --> 1:08:10.787
I am not asking you
right now, OK? I...

1:08:12.856 --> 1:08:15.592
Look, I couldn't save Mom.

1:08:16.693 --> 1:08:19.763
I couldn't help Dad,
and I am not being the one

1:08:19.796 --> 1:08:22.266
to lose you too,
so I need you to listen to me.

1:08:22.299 --> 1:08:24.868
I'm not leaving you.
Chloe, just stay where you are.

1:08:24.901 --> 1:08:27.171
TJ, now, you listen to me
right now.

1:08:28.538 --> 1:08:30.774
TJ?

1:08:30.807 --> 1:08:32.376
Hello?

1:08:37.547 --> 1:08:39.115
I had to cut the line.

1:08:39.149 --> 1:08:41.651
Can't have you making
outgoing calls.

1:08:42.619 --> 1:08:44.254
-Don't worry about him.

1:08:44.288 --> 1:08:45.922
He's a good boy.

1:08:45.955 --> 1:08:49.993
He's trained to maim
and detain, not kill.

1:09:10.614 --> 1:09:12.216
Hi.

1:09:12.249 --> 1:09:15.585
Yeah, um, I'd like to speak
to the sheriff.

1:09:45.482 --> 1:09:46.916
Sheriff.

1:09:46.950 --> 1:09:49.819
Well, if it ain't TJ Albright.

1:09:49.853 --> 1:09:51.988
What can I do for you
this fine evening?

1:09:53.223 --> 1:09:54.991
I'll, uh...I'll...

1:09:57.627 --> 1:09:59.128
..I'll confess.

1:09:59.162 --> 1:10:02.299
I just, um... I need you
to do something for me first.

1:10:02.332 --> 1:10:04.334
What's that?

1:10:05.302 --> 1:10:07.371
I need you to save my sister.

1:10:09.373 --> 1:10:11.408
Oh, shit.

1:10:59.255 --> 1:11:00.724
Alright.

1:11:00.757 --> 1:11:02.926
You want it? You like this?

1:11:02.959 --> 1:11:04.928
-OK, OK.

1:11:04.961 --> 1:11:06.596
OK, OK!

1:12:01.951 --> 1:12:03.353
TJ.

1:12:22.271 --> 1:12:23.540
Slow down there, tiger.

1:12:28.111 --> 1:12:30.780
Oh, God! Oh! Sheriff!

1:12:30.814 --> 1:12:33.316
We need to...we need
to go outside right now.

1:12:33.349 --> 1:12:35.519
-Miss Chloe Albright.
-Don't...

1:12:35.552 --> 1:12:37.954
TJ here was bullshitting me.

1:12:39.656 --> 1:12:42.459
Ooh... It's OK, TJ.

1:12:42.492 --> 1:12:45.028
What in Christ's name
is going on?

1:12:45.061 --> 1:12:47.531
OK, um...

1:12:47.564 --> 1:12:49.599
OK, look, the coroner,

1:12:49.633 --> 1:12:52.636
OK, he...he's...he's keeping
people alive, OK?

1:12:52.669 --> 1:12:54.270
He is selling...
he is selling their organs

1:12:54.303 --> 1:12:56.540
and bits and parts of them

1:12:56.573 --> 1:12:59.208
and I think he has killed
a lot of people.

1:12:59.242 --> 1:13:01.478
That's quite an accusation
this late on a Friday.

1:13:01.511 --> 1:13:04.481
You need to get in there, OK?
I saw him. I saw him.

1:13:10.086 --> 1:13:11.788
It's OK.

1:13:11.821 --> 1:13:15.792
Sheriff, he murdered somebody

1:13:15.825 --> 1:13:17.894
right in front of me.

1:13:17.927 --> 1:13:19.829
Come on.

1:13:19.863 --> 1:13:21.898
I never liked this coroner.

1:13:21.931 --> 1:13:23.800
Old-timer before him,
he was easy.

1:13:23.833 --> 1:13:26.035
This guy's
a pretentious nightmare.

1:13:26.069 --> 1:13:27.370
Yeah, yeah.

1:13:27.403 --> 1:13:30.173
If he's the psycho
you say he is,

1:13:30.206 --> 1:13:32.208
I'm looking forward to being

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:35.011
the swift boot of justice
up his ass.

1:13:36.212 --> 1:13:37.914
Tell you what.

1:13:37.947 --> 1:13:39.415
You two stay put

1:13:39.449 --> 1:13:41.751
while I go see what's what.

1:13:41.785 --> 1:13:43.152
OK, OK.

1:13:43.186 --> 1:13:45.922
But, Sheriff,
you need to be careful.

1:13:46.923 --> 1:13:48.758
I'm telling you,
he's dangerous.

1:13:49.759 --> 1:13:50.894
OK.

1:13:51.895 --> 1:13:54.564
Thank you. TJ...

1:13:54.598 --> 1:13:55.565
Oh!

1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:58.668
What the fuck?!

1:13:58.702 --> 1:14:01.037
TJ, TJ, just run! TJ!

1:14:01.070 --> 1:14:03.740
Dangerous, huh? Well, so am I.

1:14:03.773 --> 1:14:05.408
Get...

1:14:06.643 --> 1:14:08.712
No!

1:14:08.745 --> 1:14:10.413
-Mm-mm, no.
-No, no, no!

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:12.381
-Oh!

1:14:12.415 --> 1:14:14.117
Oh! TJ!

1:14:19.756 --> 1:14:21.725
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...

1:14:21.758 --> 1:14:23.593
..shut the fuck up!

1:14:23.627 --> 1:14:25.629
-Whoa...
-Let's go.

1:14:25.662 --> 1:14:29.298
-OK...
-Get the fuck away from him!

1:14:32.902 --> 1:14:34.237
Hey, now.

1:14:35.438 --> 1:14:37.607
Let's not be hasty.

1:14:39.242 --> 1:14:40.810
Is that Ross's gun?

1:14:42.111 --> 1:14:43.947
Put the gun on the ground,
Miss Albright.

1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:47.350
TJ, TJ, get behind me right now.

1:14:48.351 --> 1:14:50.620
Chloe, we should just
do what he says.

1:14:50.654 --> 1:14:52.121
No.

1:14:52.155 --> 1:14:54.157
No, we are walking out of here.

1:14:54.190 --> 1:14:55.825
Don't make me kill you.

1:14:56.826 --> 1:14:58.261
You wouldn't...

1:14:58.294 --> 1:15:00.730
..because we're more
valuable to you alive.

1:15:00.764 --> 1:15:02.131
Right?

1:15:05.501 --> 1:15:06.903
Yeah.

1:15:06.936 --> 1:15:09.138
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:19.182
The gun is fake.

1:15:22.051 --> 1:15:24.688
The gun is fake.

1:15:26.690 --> 1:15:27.991
Shit.

1:15:31.961 --> 1:15:33.162
Now...

1:15:34.564 --> 1:15:36.800
..this one is real.

1:15:36.833 --> 1:15:39.502
Changes your odds of survival
a little bit, now, don't it?

1:15:39.535 --> 1:15:41.571
Oh, TJ...

1:15:42.806 --> 1:15:45.642
I want them alive.

1:15:45.675 --> 1:15:48.712
Oh, come on, man! You serious?

1:15:48.745 --> 1:15:50.113
-I just...
-Hyah!

1:15:50.146 --> 1:15:52.515
-Oh!
-Move! Run, TJ!

1:15:54.751 --> 1:15:56.085
Go!

1:16:02.859 --> 1:16:05.061
TJ, the gate! TJ!

1:16:07.697 --> 1:16:09.532
-We're trapped...
-No, no, no, that's not good.

1:16:09.565 --> 1:16:11.400
That's not good.
That's not good.

1:16:40.429 --> 1:16:43.332
Bad...dog.

1:16:45.735 --> 1:16:47.704
-Come on.
-OK.

1:16:47.737 --> 1:16:49.205
Shit! Go!

1:17:13.629 --> 1:17:16.800
That-a-boy, Mac.
Burn 'em down.

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:23.539
Go!

1:17:26.509 --> 1:17:28.812
Let's go. Go.
Just go. Go! Go, go!

1:17:33.149 --> 1:17:34.350
Fuck.

1:17:50.366 --> 1:17:51.801
TJ?

1:17:54.503 --> 1:17:55.671
TJ?!

1:17:57.473 --> 1:17:58.507
TJ!

1:18:09.185 --> 1:18:12.288
-Shit! No! Chloe!

1:18:14.791 --> 1:18:16.492
Chloe! Fuck!

1:18:19.695 --> 1:18:22.198
Chloe!

1:18:23.566 --> 1:18:24.801
TJ!

1:18:24.834 --> 1:18:26.770
Let me go!

1:18:26.803 --> 1:18:28.004
Chloe!

1:18:38.347 --> 1:18:40.216
-Chloe!

1:18:40.249 --> 1:18:42.151
-Get off!
-Chloe!

1:18:42.185 --> 1:18:44.653
Get off me! Get off me!

1:18:47.156 --> 1:18:49.558
-Get off of him! Get off of him!

1:18:49.592 --> 1:18:51.861
Get off of him! Get off!

1:18:53.529 --> 1:18:55.298
Come on, get him off!
Get him off!

1:18:56.900 --> 1:19:00.136
Get him off! Get him off!

1:19:23.359 --> 1:19:25.528
TJ? TJ?

1:19:27.596 --> 1:19:30.599
-You have to get up.
-No, I need a minute, OK? No.

1:19:33.402 --> 1:19:36.205
Come on. You've got to get up.

1:19:36.239 --> 1:19:37.506
You've got to get up.

1:19:42.578 --> 1:19:45.448
Slow down, down.
Fuck. Alright.

1:19:45.481 --> 1:19:47.550
OK, we're trapped.

1:19:49.252 --> 1:19:51.220
OK.

1:19:53.256 --> 1:19:54.891
OK, it's locked.
We got to break in.

1:19:54.924 --> 1:19:56.960
Look on the ground, OK?

1:20:00.729 --> 1:20:01.898
-This will work.
-Yeah.

1:20:01.931 --> 1:20:03.066
OK, OK.

1:20:03.099 --> 1:20:04.767
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:06.569
-I need you to twist it.
-I know.

1:20:09.172 --> 1:20:10.573
-One, two...
-Come on.

1:20:12.108 --> 1:20:13.542
-OK, that's it.
-Yep, go.

1:20:13.576 --> 1:20:16.245
-OK, OK.

1:20:37.967 --> 1:20:39.802
You OK, bud?

1:20:39.835 --> 1:20:41.537
They rattle your brain?

1:20:50.546 --> 1:20:52.115
Where are they?

1:20:53.282 --> 1:20:55.618
They went down there.

1:20:55.651 --> 1:20:57.853
Keep 'em there
till we can drive them to us.

1:20:59.655 --> 1:21:01.657
-How?
-Smoke 'em out.

1:21:01.690 --> 1:21:03.292
Tear gas in my car.

1:21:06.795 --> 1:21:08.331
What the fuck is that?

1:21:08.364 --> 1:21:10.266
Mannix.

1:21:10.299 --> 1:21:11.400
Shit!

1:21:12.401 --> 1:21:14.737
No-one's supposed to know
about me, remember?

1:21:26.382 --> 1:21:28.184
TJ.

1:21:28.217 --> 1:21:30.519
Come here. Come here.

1:21:30.553 --> 1:21:32.288
-OK? It's OK.
-I'm so sorry, Chloe.

1:21:32.321 --> 1:21:34.057
-No.
-I'm sorry.

1:21:34.090 --> 1:21:36.692
It's OK. It's OK.

1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:40.029
-You're OK.
-I'm sorry, Chloe.

1:21:40.063 --> 1:21:41.397
Hey.

1:21:41.430 --> 1:21:42.966
It is going to be OK.

1:21:42.999 --> 1:21:44.200
-Shh!
-No, it's not.

1:21:44.233 --> 1:21:45.801
-No, we're trapped.
-Look at me.

1:21:45.834 --> 1:21:47.937
There is going to be
a way out of here.

1:21:49.272 --> 1:21:51.007
You need to trust me.

1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:52.641
-Yeah, OK.
-OK.

1:21:52.675 --> 1:21:54.310
-We're a team.
-Yeah, I know.

1:21:54.343 --> 1:21:55.979
Come on.

1:22:04.287 --> 1:22:05.654
"Wow, look at me.

1:22:05.688 --> 1:22:07.056
"I'm the coroner. I got keys."

1:22:07.090 --> 1:22:09.325
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, open up the door.

1:22:18.267 --> 1:22:19.402
What's the deal?

1:22:19.435 --> 1:22:21.104
You're not gonna
let me in this time?

1:22:22.105 --> 1:22:24.140
There's been a situation
with the liver.

1:22:27.610 --> 1:22:30.246
-I lost it.
-What?

1:22:30.279 --> 1:22:32.348
What the fuck, man?
That puts us down 100 grand.

1:22:32.381 --> 1:22:34.883
I'm in the process
of replacing it.

1:22:34.917 --> 1:22:37.053
I need you to come back
in an hour.

1:22:38.887 --> 1:22:40.589
What the fuck
is up with your eye?

1:22:42.891 --> 1:22:45.394
Why did you change
this shit up on me?

1:22:45.428 --> 1:22:48.397
You know Mannix is
a creature of habit.

1:22:48.431 --> 1:22:50.566
You're making me nervous.

1:22:50.599 --> 1:22:53.736
I'm starting to sweat in places
you don't wanna hear about.

1:22:57.673 --> 1:22:59.975
What the fuck?
Is that a cop car?

1:23:00.009 --> 1:23:01.277
What if he sees me?

1:23:06.815 --> 1:23:09.918
Oh, shit!
You sly motherfucker, you.

1:23:09.952 --> 1:23:12.155
You got a pig
working for you, don't you?

1:23:12.188 --> 1:23:14.090
That's how you get
the live ones.

1:23:14.123 --> 1:23:16.459
Me and Chase,
the pick-up guy in Lancaster,

1:23:16.492 --> 1:23:18.394
we was wondering about that.

1:23:18.427 --> 1:23:22.565
Fuck, now I owe him 50 bucks.
I knew I smelled bacon.

1:23:22.598 --> 1:23:24.300
So where is he?
Can I meet him?

1:23:24.333 --> 1:23:25.768
Or her. I'm down
with either one.

1:23:25.801 --> 1:23:27.270
We're all part of the
same team, right?

1:23:27.303 --> 1:23:28.804
It's... What?

1:23:28.837 --> 1:23:30.606
Ugh!

1:23:30.639 --> 1:23:33.109
Gunshot.

1:23:33.142 --> 1:23:35.778
Oh, God. Who's shooting who?

1:23:35.811 --> 1:23:38.747
It doesn't matter. OK.

1:23:38.781 --> 1:23:40.149
Come on.

1:23:41.550 --> 1:23:43.119
Motherfucker!

1:23:44.987 --> 1:23:46.255
What?

1:23:46.289 --> 1:23:48.491
You just cost us $100,000.

1:23:48.524 --> 1:23:49.992
He had a big mouth.

1:23:50.025 --> 1:23:51.527
Shame we can't sell that.

1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:53.229
We would have raised
a pretty penny.

1:24:04.673 --> 1:24:06.075
Ow!

1:24:17.220 --> 1:24:19.688
-TJ.
-What?

1:24:19.722 --> 1:24:21.524
Over here.

1:24:27.096 --> 1:24:29.031
-Move this?
-Yeah.

1:24:30.833 --> 1:24:32.067
Shh!

1:24:32.101 --> 1:24:33.869
Shh! Shh!

1:24:35.104 --> 1:24:36.505
OK.

1:24:37.606 --> 1:24:40.042
-Can we get through?
-Yeah, yeah, we can.

1:24:40.075 --> 1:24:42.245
Shh! Shh!

1:24:42.278 --> 1:24:43.846
OK.

1:24:56.925 --> 1:24:59.728
-You OK?
-Yeah, there's just some pipe.

1:24:59.762 --> 1:25:02.131
-Watch it.
-OK.

1:25:14.277 --> 1:25:16.179
Shh, shh, shh.

1:25:24.587 --> 1:25:27.590
You shot our contact.
You, Sheriff, have fucked us.

1:25:27.623 --> 1:25:29.725
Not the way
I see it, partner.

1:25:29.758 --> 1:25:32.628
This guy was shot
by some intruder.

1:25:32.661 --> 1:25:34.597
The same punks
locked in the basement.

1:25:34.630 --> 1:25:36.632
They killed him, not us.

1:25:36.665 --> 1:25:38.801
Can't we just hand over
his liver?

1:25:46.442 --> 1:25:49.812
I don't think they'll accept
a liver with buckshot, do you?

1:25:49.845 --> 1:25:53.882
OK. How about the ones
you keep in reserve downstairs?

1:25:53.916 --> 1:25:56.719
Spare parts
from drunks, junkies.

1:25:56.752 --> 1:25:58.954
Kidneys are OK, eyes are good,

1:25:58.987 --> 1:26:01.290
but livers are rotten.

1:26:02.291 --> 1:26:03.859
How about yours?

1:26:05.661 --> 1:26:07.062
Don't even joke.

1:26:07.095 --> 1:26:08.997
You so much as raise
an eyebrow at me

1:26:09.031 --> 1:26:11.634
and I will shoot you
in the fuckin' face.

1:26:14.036 --> 1:26:16.104
And what story will you tell?

1:26:16.138 --> 1:26:17.806
Any one I want.

1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:21.844
I'll be a goddamn hero,
stopping the Calexico Butcher.

1:26:21.877 --> 1:26:24.012
Might even get a parade.

1:26:26.549 --> 1:26:28.684
Squirrelly SOB, ain't he?

1:26:36.859 --> 1:26:38.327
I'll make the call.

1:26:38.361 --> 1:26:40.496
I'll tell them there's
been a slight hiccup...

1:26:41.964 --> 1:26:43.599
..but there's
a solution in play.

1:26:43.632 --> 1:26:45.200
What about him?

1:26:45.234 --> 1:26:46.869
Get the tear gas.

1:26:48.170 --> 1:26:49.805
We need a liver.

1:27:03.852 --> 1:27:06.722
I have the item
you requested on hand.

1:27:06.755 --> 1:27:08.691
But you'll need a new courier.

1:27:08.724 --> 1:27:11.059
Drive it yourself.

1:27:11.093 --> 1:27:15.063
Transfer me an extra 50.
Your rush is not my problem.

1:27:23.105 --> 1:27:24.907
I'm sorry, TJ.

1:27:24.940 --> 1:27:26.041
No, no. He's gone.

1:27:31.213 --> 1:27:34.550
Your man getting blindsided
is not my fault.

1:27:34.583 --> 1:27:38.521
Misfortune is remedied
by ingenuity.

1:27:40.889 --> 1:27:42.391
And money.

1:27:42.425 --> 1:27:44.327
Deliver in two hours.

1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:46.362
You'll have your extra.

1:27:46.395 --> 1:27:47.930
Don't be late.

1:27:52.535 --> 1:27:54.603
Rats in the walls.

1:28:16.392 --> 1:28:18.427
Grab his legs.
Grab his legs.

1:28:20.996 --> 1:28:23.466
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.
-Shh, shh, shh!

1:28:23.499 --> 1:28:25.300
He's...he's bleeding
all over the place.

1:28:25.334 --> 1:28:26.769
Who the hell
are you guys?

1:28:26.802 --> 1:28:28.471
No-one. OK, OK, good.

1:28:28.504 --> 1:28:30.105
Well, you just
saved my ass back there,

1:28:30.138 --> 1:28:31.774
so that's got
to make you somebody.

1:28:31.807 --> 1:28:33.542
OK,
this is gonna hurt.

1:28:33.576 --> 1:28:36.745
-Sorry! Shh, shh, shh!

1:28:36.779 --> 1:28:38.313
I'm sorry.

1:28:38.347 --> 1:28:41.650
Get me the hell out of here, I
got 10 G's with your name on it.

1:28:41.684 --> 1:28:44.052
-Make it 25.
-TJ.

1:28:44.086 --> 1:28:45.621
Our enemy's enemy has money.

1:28:45.654 --> 1:28:48.557
We need it, he needs us. Right?

1:28:48.591 --> 1:28:50.125
I don't know. I can't think.

1:28:50.158 --> 1:28:52.961
Done. But Mannix can't be dead.

1:28:55.263 --> 1:28:56.765
The fuck?

1:28:58.367 --> 1:28:59.668
Tear gas.

1:28:59.702 --> 1:29:01.937
OK, uh, TJ?

1:29:01.970 --> 1:29:03.772
I need you to focus, OK?
Focus. Get back...

1:29:13.516 --> 1:29:15.818
OK, look at me.
OK, you need to put this on.

1:29:15.851 --> 1:29:18.687
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Breathe. Breathe.

1:29:18.721 --> 1:29:20.956
They're going to come
after me, OK?

1:29:20.989 --> 1:29:22.691
You take him,
you go where it's safe

1:29:22.725 --> 1:29:25.093
and then you wait and then
you get the fuckin' money.

1:29:25.127 --> 1:29:26.995
-No, no. Wait, wait...
-Listen to him, OK?

1:29:27.029 --> 1:29:29.264
I'm gonna be fine.
You go. Go, go, go, go.

1:29:29.297 --> 1:29:30.699
OK, OK.

1:29:30.733 --> 1:29:32.835
Go, go. There, under.

1:29:32.868 --> 1:29:34.503
You follow him, OK?

1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:39.074
Oh, fuck!

1:30:42.771 --> 1:30:45.107
-Dammit!

1:30:45.140 --> 1:30:46.609
God!

1:30:48.944 --> 1:30:50.412
Alright.

1:30:51.880 --> 1:30:53.381
OK.

1:31:17.640 --> 1:31:19.942
-OK.

1:31:19.975 --> 1:31:22.444
Shh! Shh! Shh!

1:31:23.946 --> 1:31:25.047
Go, go.

1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:27.182
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

1:32:09.057 --> 1:32:10.726
I got her!

1:32:15.197 --> 1:32:17.299
Nowhere to run, baby.

1:32:18.967 --> 1:32:20.969
Drop the hammer.

1:32:23.739 --> 1:32:25.207
Ugh!

1:33:24.232 --> 1:33:25.600
Shit.

1:33:36.779 --> 1:33:39.281
Your sister owes me a liver.

1:33:39.314 --> 1:33:41.116
Yours will do.

1:33:57.499 --> 1:33:59.101
Chloe?

1:33:59.134 --> 1:34:02.304
You have completely
ruined my life.

1:34:03.672 --> 1:34:05.407
I can explain a lot of things,

1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:07.743
but a dead sheriff
is not one of them.

1:34:10.345 --> 1:34:12.781
Looks like I'll have to move on.

1:34:15.017 --> 1:34:17.385
But before I do,

1:34:17.419 --> 1:34:19.287
you should know

1:34:19.321 --> 1:34:22.157
that this pathetic life
of your brother's...

1:34:23.759 --> 1:34:27.395
..will bring renewed life
to three, maybe even four

1:34:27.429 --> 1:34:29.932
more worthy people.

1:34:31.366 --> 1:34:33.969
And once he's donated
to the deserving...

1:34:49.384 --> 1:34:51.119
..it will be your turn.

1:35:22.384 --> 1:35:23.585
TJ?

1:35:25.187 --> 1:35:27.823
TJ. Hey.

1:35:29.925 --> 1:35:31.693
Hi. Hi.

1:35:31.726 --> 1:35:33.661
It's gonna be OK, OK?

1:35:33.695 --> 1:35:35.330
I got you.

1:35:35.363 --> 1:35:37.833
-Behind you...
-What? What?

1:35:37.866 --> 1:35:39.501
Behind you.

1:35:39.534 --> 1:35:40.836
Hi.

1:35:45.774 --> 1:35:47.976
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

1:35:48.010 --> 1:35:49.544
An eye...

1:35:50.779 --> 1:35:52.247
..for an eye.

1:35:53.949 --> 1:35:56.351
No...

1:36:16.939 --> 1:36:19.507
Oh, holy shit.

1:37:08.823 --> 1:37:10.358
It's my turn now.

1:37:34.682 --> 1:37:35.750
Huh!

1:37:35.783 --> 1:37:37.986
Arggh! Arggh!

1:37:42.390 --> 1:37:43.725
Take it!

1:37:56.905 --> 1:37:59.207
You are the sickness.

1:38:00.508 --> 1:38:02.310
I'm the cure.

1:39:16.151 --> 1:39:17.419
I'm OK.

1:39:17.452 --> 1:39:19.787
OK, w-w-we saved you, so...

1:39:19.821 --> 1:39:22.290
..you know, you...

1:39:22.324 --> 1:39:23.625
..you gotta pay.

1:39:23.658 --> 1:39:26.728
I saved you back, so...

1:39:26.761 --> 1:39:28.596
..seems like we're even.

1:39:30.632 --> 1:39:32.134
That's bullshit.

1:39:35.737 --> 1:39:37.072
I still need something.

1:39:38.073 --> 1:39:39.641
You get it for me...

1:39:40.642 --> 1:39:42.477
..I pay you in full.

1:39:52.587 --> 1:39:53.755
God, I hate that damn dog.

1:39:53.788 --> 1:39:55.990
Dr Death killed his reserves.

1:39:56.024 --> 1:39:58.060
No loose ends, I guess.

1:39:58.093 --> 1:40:01.129
Not that it matters now,
you arrogant fuck.

1:40:01.163 --> 1:40:03.131
Mannix is a bad dude,

1:40:03.165 --> 1:40:05.067
but that motherfucker,

1:40:05.100 --> 1:40:08.002
he's gonna be the devil's bitch
for sure.

1:40:11.005 --> 1:40:12.607
OK.

1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:14.842
OK, she's done.

1:40:14.876 --> 1:40:16.111
Pay up.

1:40:21.116 --> 1:40:23.151
A deal's a deal, my man.

1:40:51.246 --> 1:40:52.647
Nice shirt, man.

1:40:52.680 --> 1:40:53.881
Huh!

1:40:53.915 --> 1:40:56.184
Hey, you good?

1:40:56.218 --> 1:40:57.852
Yeah, I'm better than ever.

1:41:01.156 --> 1:41:02.890
You need a ride?

1:41:02.924 --> 1:41:04.892
You need a doctor.

1:41:04.926 --> 1:41:06.861
There's one where I'm going.

1:41:06.894 --> 1:41:08.430
Close enough.

1:41:09.431 --> 1:41:12.200
So can I drop
you two off or what?

1:41:16.003 --> 1:41:17.239
Yeah.

1:41:17.272 --> 1:41:19.741
-Alright.
-You can drop us off.

1:41:25.747 --> 1:41:28.216
-Oh, hey, uh...

1:41:29.217 --> 1:41:32.287
I almost forgot
to give this to you.

1:41:39.761 --> 1:41:41.963
-Ready to get outta here?
-Fuck, yeah.
