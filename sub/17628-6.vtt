<i>Previously on"Salem"...</i>

00:06.339 --> 00:07.840
No.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.842
I'm sorry.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.947
She deserves it.
But the innocent life

00:14.949 --> 00:16.515
inside her womb does not!

00:16.517 --> 00:17.983
That you spared me.

00:17.985 --> 00:19.952
I know which one I want. Mercy.

00:19.954 --> 00:21.854
She keeps their manhoods
locked up in her room.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.455
Go back. Go.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.657
Aah!

00:25.659 --> 00:27.226
- Who did this?
- Drink it,

00:27.228 --> 00:29.395
and you, too, shall be free
of my hold forever.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.296
I do not want it.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.832
I have earned my reward
and my vengeance.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.667
All shall be as we agreed.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.637
Once you arrange this
one last matter.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.040
Murder my brother.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.875
There's one with child.
Will you have a look?

00:42.877 --> 00:44.676
I need to find him.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.378
The baby's father?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.414
Cotton Mather.

This is too nice for a wh...

01:02.162 --> 01:04.997
- For someone like me.
- Nonsense.

01:04.998 --> 01:08.033
This is now your room,
for as long as you need it.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.903
What will your father say?

01:10.905 --> 01:14.006
My parents passed away
during the plague.

01:14.008 --> 01:16.008
I'm so sorry.

01:20.180 --> 01:24.636
They're with the lord now,
and I can use their name

01:24.787 --> 01:28.854
and their fortune to help the
less fortunate in Salem.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.890
You were always so different

01:31.892 --> 01:33.959
from everyone else in this town.

01:33.961 --> 01:37.729
So kind, so generous,

01:37.731 --> 01:39.798
even to a fallen woman.

01:42.469 --> 01:45.537
In this world,
no woman should judge another

01:45.539 --> 01:48.033
for the choices she's
forced to make.

01:48.184 --> 01:50.642
And I'm quite sure
we are all fallen

01:50.644 --> 01:55.744
in one way or another. But when
we fall, we get back up.

You need to get some rest,

the precious cargo of life

02:10.131 --> 02:13.002
Every life is precious,
but I can't help feeling

02:13.153 --> 02:15.851
the little babe in your

You look very fine
in that gown, mother.

04:10.084 --> 04:13.252
I am happy to see you
looking so ravishing.

04:13.254 --> 04:16.688
And I am grateful to the baron
for restoring my gowns to me.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.858
I'd forgotten what it feels like
to dress properly.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.794
Excellent.
He did right to do so.

04:22.796 --> 04:27.299
Since today is indeed
a day worth dressing for...

04:27.301 --> 04:30.269
A most special day.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.503
Wednesday.

04:43.784 --> 04:48.153
Every end
must have its beginning.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.821
And some of us have been

04:49.823 --> 04:54.893
awaiting this beginning
of the end a very long time.

04:54.895 --> 04:58.930
And now it is here.

04:58.932 --> 05:05.937
This Sunday
will at last be black Sunday.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.273
About time. Yes.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.976
It is all about time, isn't it?

05:10.978 --> 05:13.111
I'm sorry, dear brother,
to have tested your Patience.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.680
It is not about me or you,

05:14.682 --> 05:16.915
but our brothers
must be released.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.817
I do not answer to them or you.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.154
While you play with toys,
they burn in hell.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.922
Perhaps I made a mistake
choosing you, of all of them,

05:23.924 --> 05:25.090
to help me?

05:25.092 --> 05:29.761
Then why now, my lord?

05:29.763 --> 05:35.934
Because inside and out,
everything is finally ready.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.704
These are the final five days
of life in Salem.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.606
When black Sunday comes,

05:41.608 --> 05:44.276
all outside this house
will perish,

05:44.278 --> 05:48.180
and all those fortunate souls
inside the Sibley mansion

05:48.182 --> 05:51.216
will live to see the new era.

05:51.218 --> 05:54.486
So let us savor
these coming days,

05:54.488 --> 05:57.556
for soon we ring the change,

05:57.558 --> 06:00.759
and nothing will be the same.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.565
Open the gates!
Open them for the wagon!

It's John.
It's John Alden, returned!

06:19.513 --> 06:22.147
We're saved!
What happened at Deerfield?

06:22.149 --> 06:25.350
My son, he lives near the meeting house
there. I need to get a letter to him.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.651
How close are the French?

06:26.653 --> 06:28.053
Are we ready for them?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.554
How stand our defenses?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.325
Help us, John.
What did you see, John?

06:33.327 --> 06:35.560
Are we ready? Help us.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.083
Where the hell have you been?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.385
And why the hell
have you taken so long?

07:00.387 --> 07:04.356
The whole town's under attack,
and there are no defenses.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.525
Treasurer Putnam
has disappeared.

07:06.527 --> 07:10.359
Half of Salem thinks I did away
with him and the other half thinks

07:10.510 --> 07:14.282
he's fled for safety to Boston and
are preparing to do the same.

07:15.635 --> 07:19.704
I saved your life, Alden,
and I expected results.

07:22.875 --> 07:26.244
There's no point
in building a stockade.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.413
The French have their hands
on a weapon

07:28.415 --> 07:30.816
that turns heart pine
into kindling...

07:30.818 --> 07:32.984
A kind of powder
that burns like a forge

07:32.986 --> 07:35.454
and can destroy an entire town with
a single shot. Such things exist

07:35.456 --> 07:38.089
only in the fevered dreams
of alchemists.

07:38.091 --> 07:42.260
Really, captain, I expected more sense
from a hardened soldier like yourself.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.296
I've seen it with my own eyes
in Deerfield.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.931
The town turned to ash.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.301
Hundreds of people killed in the
blink of an eye, and Salem is next.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.570
How can we possibly
defend against that?

07:51.572 --> 07:54.239
By making sure
they don't take that shot...

07:54.241 --> 07:56.975
Not from close enough
to reach us.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.011
Now, I'll build a perimeter
around town.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.147
I'll round up some men today.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.483
That should do it.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.586
Anything else I can get
for our hero?

08:07.588 --> 08:10.755
Shave, haircut...

08:10.757 --> 08:12.524
A meat pie?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.459
Not for me.

08:14.461 --> 08:18.263
All I need is home and sleep.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.132
But you can ask
the magistrate here.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.934
He's paying.

08:24.537 --> 08:25.837
If Salem's paying,

08:25.839 --> 08:28.273
you might as well
get dinner out of it.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.775
Two meat pies, please.

08:57.169 --> 09:00.038
I'm glad to see you alive.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.008
The feeling isn't mutual.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.477
Not for myself.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.312
For Mary's sake.

09:07.314 --> 09:10.382
And I have a mission for you.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.018
No. You haven't even heard
what the mission is.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.519
I don't trust you.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.820
I never have.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.055
So the answer is no,

09:17.057 --> 09:20.258
unless I get to see my Mary,
first.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.694
I haven't laid eyes on her since
she walked into that damn house.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.529
It is dangerous.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.932
And worse,
a waste of the very thing

09:26.934 --> 09:30.235
we have the least of... time.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.209
Time runs out, mother.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.844
If we don't do anything
by Sunday,

09:39.846 --> 09:42.080
this blood will be all
I have left of Mary Sibley.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.183
<i>Then shut up and feed it to me.</i>

09:45.185 --> 09:47.586
<i>The more of her blood I have,
the more I can help you.</i>

10:01.033 --> 10:03.535
Tell me before it is too late.

10:03.537 --> 10:04.869
How can I make her mine,

10:04.871 --> 10:06.438
without that boy
destroying us both?

10:06.440 --> 10:09.708
<i>You have powers. Use them.
I told you.</i>

10:09.710 --> 10:11.242
I want the love of a free woman,

10:11.244 --> 10:12.644
not a bespelled puppet.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.913
<i>You do not have to
control her footsteps</i>

10:14.915 --> 10:17.248
<i>to throw rose petals
at her feet.</i>

10:17.250 --> 10:20.051
<i>Use magic to court,
not to conquer.</i>

10:20.053 --> 10:22.621
<i>And leave the dark lord to me.</i>

10:22.623 --> 10:24.923
<i>I swear to you, you shall see,</i>

10:24.925 --> 10:28.293
<i>when the time comes,
I will deal with him.</i>

10:32.765 --> 10:36.067
I'm glad you have
your dresses back.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.971
The countess was wrong
to take them from you.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.340
There seems little point
in such finery,

10:42.342 --> 10:44.943
if Salem is to burn.

10:44.945 --> 10:48.146
But you will not burn, mother.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.321
You, above all, will be safe.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.257
More than safe.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.659
I have a surprise for you.

11:06.365 --> 11:10.769
Black Sunday
will be the end for many,

11:10.771 --> 11:14.539
but a new beginning for us.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.508
You fool!

11:50.510 --> 11:53.211
You risk everything by snatching
me from that house so openly.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.480
What if I had been seen?
You were not.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.316
I have already dispatched
the Essex traitor,

11:58.318 --> 12:00.485
<i>and he is the reckless one.</i>

12:06.025 --> 12:08.827
I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.496
I was afraid of the same thing.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.099
But now I'm even more afraid
for all of us.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.934
You are right to fear.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.903
There is a great terror coming.
I know.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.873
I've seen it.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.242
What does it do?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.277
Burns. Everything.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.779
All of Deerfield
and everyone in it.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.447
We have little time.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.950
Your son intends to turn that
on Salem in five days.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.518
<i>Our son.</i>

12:33.520 --> 12:36.087
You did not birth him alone
or fail him alone.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.057
But she's right.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.458
We're running out of time.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.093
Where did you get that locket?

12:42.095 --> 12:46.598
I saw Sebastian
give this to a French officer,

12:46.600 --> 12:49.634
and that Frenchman is now dead,

12:49.636 --> 12:51.703
which means our son
must have some other plan.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.204
So we need got to figure out
what that is,

12:53.206 --> 12:54.372
and our best chance is...

12:54.374 --> 12:56.074
Sebastian. Yes.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.042
Draw him out of the house.
Let me get my hands on him.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.711
I'll make him talk. No.

12:59.713 --> 13:01.079
Against magic like his,

13:01.081 --> 13:03.214
even your strength
will be useless.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.449
Then what?

13:05.885 --> 13:07.185
Leave us.

13:21.467 --> 13:25.670
You taste so different.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.572
For the first time
since we were parted,

13:27.574 --> 13:30.809
you are kissing me,
not Mary the witch.

13:32.845 --> 13:35.280
Well, if you're no longer
a witch, you're free.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.915
We can leave. No.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.317
No, I'm free from my contract
with the dark lord,

13:39.319 --> 13:41.486
but it was not his power
that brought me back.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.823
It came from roots and moons
and blood and wombs.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.859
Women's magic... the Essex tree.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.160
As I told you before,

13:49.162 --> 13:50.962
if we have any future together,
John,

13:50.964 --> 13:52.831
it must be here in Salem.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.999
But if you have
no magic, either,

13:55.001 --> 13:57.502
how can you expect
to stop Sebastian.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.774
No.

14:02.776 --> 14:05.043
We have no choice.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.112
We must find out
what Sebastian knows.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.781
I cannot let you
back into that house,

14:09.783 --> 14:11.783
vulnerable and powerless.

14:11.785 --> 14:15.787
Vulnerable I may be,
but I am not powerless.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.456
I am the most powerful thing
there is.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.692
I'm a woman in love.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.725
My dear, whatever is the matter?

14:53.727 --> 14:55.727
Nothing.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.730
Merely the end of the world.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.832
Black Sunday is coming.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.066
Black Sunday?

15:02.068 --> 15:04.102
Satanic Easter...

15:04.104 --> 15:06.604
The unholiest day
in the devil's calendar.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.707
What is that?

15:09.709 --> 15:11.276
Nothing.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.111
Brown Jenkins running wild
with his new freedom.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.914
Go on.
Tell me about black Sunday.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.849
Easter is the resurrection,

15:17.851 --> 15:20.418
the foundation stone
of Christendom,

15:20.420 --> 15:23.721
proof that god will judge
the world in righteousness.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.190
So imagine then
what the devil's Easter is...

15:26.192 --> 15:27.792
Judgment in evil,

15:27.794 --> 15:31.796
the beginning of
the devil's reign on earth.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.197
Go on. Pack your things.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.365
No. Why? I told you.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.634
Black Sunday is coming.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.970
The boy said we have
but five days left

15:38.972 --> 15:40.305
of life in Salem.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.906
We must move inside the mansion.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.441
The only safe place is inside.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.143
Sunday?
I have things to prepare...

15:45.145 --> 15:47.478
Anne, I will not leave
you behind like lot's wife.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.652
I did not come all the way back
to Salem just to lose you,

15:54.654 --> 15:56.654
or our child.

15:58.090 --> 16:01.426
Rest assured, my dear husband.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.895
I will do what I need to do,

16:03.897 --> 16:07.665
and before Sunday,
I will join you in the mansion.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.734
Yes. You will.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.470
For you are now
not just my wife,

16:12.472 --> 16:14.639
but my life.

16:22.514 --> 16:23.982
Cotton!

16:24.249 --> 16:25.950
Cotton.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.685
Hush now.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.320
Everything is all right.

16:33.158 --> 16:36.928
Cotton.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.496
I heard him!

16:38.498 --> 16:39.931
I know I did.

16:39.933 --> 16:43.434
Fever makes us hear things,

16:43.436 --> 16:46.804
people, that aren't there.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.439
It's only you and I here.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.108
No, I... and the baby.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.876
And for its sake, calm yourself.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.845
Can... can...
Can you not send him word?

16:53.847 --> 16:55.513
If he knew, I know he would...

16:55.515 --> 16:58.383
Yes. I'm sure if he knew,
he would fly to your side.

16:58.385 --> 17:01.452
He is that kind of man.

17:01.454 --> 17:05.189
But remember,
cotton Mather is a public man.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.991
And when he returns to Salem
from Boston,

17:06.992 --> 17:09.993
I will get word to him,
but quietly.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.678
Business. Governance.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.548
These have been my brides.

17:32.252 --> 17:36.087
Now I find myself happy slave

17:36.089 --> 17:38.990
to such strange sensations.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.561
I cannot go on like this.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.164
Business...
My business, your business,

17:46.166 --> 17:48.166
this business of love.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.068
All this must be one.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.837
You are asking me to marry you.

17:52.839 --> 17:53.905
Yes!

17:55.774 --> 17:57.375
You see?

17:57.377 --> 18:00.578
We're already of one mind.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.281
Let us be of one heart, too.

18:05.217 --> 18:09.554
Marriage, along with the
restoration of your good name,

18:09.556 --> 18:12.523
is the only way
we can be together

18:12.525 --> 18:15.026
and keep hold of
what we both have,

18:15.028 --> 18:18.362
and together we can displace

18:18.364 --> 18:22.767
that mealy-mouthed Mather
and his insipid wife

18:22.769 --> 18:26.437
and become
first couple of Salem.

18:32.211 --> 18:35.480
You are so very forceful,
my dear.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.584
And I love you for it.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.420
Of course, I would gladly
accept your proposal.

18:42.422 --> 18:46.157
But there remains one obstacle.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.826
Wh... what obstacle?

18:48.828 --> 18:51.496
Name it, and I shall remove it.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.031
I swear.

18:54.900 --> 18:59.837
An obstacle named Isaac.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.005
Good boy.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.375
Good boy.

19:20.192 --> 19:22.059
Cake?

19:31.971 --> 19:33.371
It's delicious.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.276
Bet there ain't much
in this world

19:38.278 --> 19:40.144
that can't be made better
by cake.

19:40.146 --> 19:43.347
If I was king of the world,

19:43.349 --> 19:45.183
I'd say cake for everyone.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.353
Cake every day.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.058
Where did a little thing
like you

19:54.060 --> 19:57.628
learn how to make
such a big tasting cake?

19:57.630 --> 19:59.630
Well, my mama taught me.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.667
Hers were better.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.970
Well, she probably made
hundreds of them.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.642
I wish she was here.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.710
Nope.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.147
No tears.

20:16.149 --> 20:20.251
You are the luckiest girl
I know.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.653
My mama's dead.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.056
How's that lucky? No, silly.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.992
That's not the lucky part.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.328
She loved you.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.363
That's the lucky part.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.031
Better to lose
a mom that loved you

20:34.033 --> 20:35.366
than have one still alive

20:35.368 --> 20:38.402
who gave up on you
out of shame...

20:38.404 --> 20:40.071
One that wouldn't even
look you in the eyes

20:40.073 --> 20:44.275
once you was branded,

20:44.277 --> 20:47.511
kicked you out your own home,

20:47.513 --> 20:49.814
sold you into servitude.

21:04.229 --> 21:05.963
But you know what
I think we need?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.101
More cake!

21:20.979 --> 21:22.813
Bastard acacia...

21:25.083 --> 21:27.118
black nightshade...

21:28.754 --> 21:31.589
fleabane...

21:31.591 --> 21:32.823
tannis root.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.696
What do I lack?

21:39.598 --> 21:41.732
Yes. Grave earth.

23:02.547 --> 23:06.217
From this distance,
no French Cannon can hit Salem.

23:06.219 --> 23:09.053
They must not
get past this line.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.522
What do we do
if we see the French?

23:11.524 --> 23:14.925
Give the signal, warn the next
man, and kill the bastard.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.727
What if there's
more than one of them?

23:19.431 --> 23:21.732
Then fight like tomahawk Billy.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.701
Who's tomahawk Billy?

23:23.703 --> 23:26.270
Well, he's only
the toughest Indian fighter

23:26.272 --> 23:28.005
I've ever met.

23:28.007 --> 23:33.778
He took on five Abenaki
singlehandedly.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.747
Why'd they call him
tomahawk Billy?

23:38.450 --> 23:40.618
Well, that's about
the best part of the whole tale.

23:42.788 --> 23:46.791
You see, Billy took a blow,
a killing blow,

23:46.793 --> 23:49.427
from a tomahawk
right to the chest.

23:49.429 --> 23:54.098
He was a goner, and so was I.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.267
The last Indian
was right on top of me

23:56.269 --> 24:00.037
trying to push his knife down.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.973
What'd Billy do?

24:02.975 --> 24:07.478
He pulled that tomahawk
right out of his own heart

24:07.480 --> 24:10.748
and lopped off
that brave's head.

24:10.750 --> 24:14.785
He only had enough time to say,
"there you go, captain,"

24:14.787 --> 24:16.120
and he was gone.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.162
You're the watch now.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.132
Stand tall.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.733
Relief in eight hours.

24:47.185 --> 24:50.821
All right.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.858
You held up
your end of the bargain.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.426
What do you want?

24:55.428 --> 24:59.029
The devil's brother
is determined to destroy Mary.

24:59.031 --> 25:02.466
I didn't know the devil had kin.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.535
The devil
was not always the devil.

25:04.537 --> 25:10.140
The devil was once an angel,
an angel named Samael.

25:10.142 --> 25:13.177
By his side stood another angel,

25:13.179 --> 25:16.313
some call this one
the devil's right hand,

25:16.315 --> 25:18.148
his sentinel.

25:18.150 --> 25:21.118
And he and strives
to raise his old army

25:21.120 --> 25:24.455
of fallen angels from hell.

25:24.457 --> 25:28.893
But he is convinced
that Mary makes the boy weak.

25:28.895 --> 25:34.398
And whether the boy, Samael,
wants him to,

25:34.400 --> 25:37.301
he will destroy Mary,

25:37.303 --> 25:39.537
unless you destroy him first.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.977
Everything you need
to kill an angel.

25:49.881 --> 25:53.050
How the hell am I supposed to
kill him with this poison?

25:53.052 --> 25:56.587
You must forge a dagger
with that in it

25:56.589 --> 25:58.822
and kill him with the dagger.

26:27.452 --> 26:28.953
We need to talk.

26:38.063 --> 26:41.198
We may speak without
fear of being overheard here,

26:41.200 --> 26:43.801
except, of course, by my mother.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.372
I am not made of iron.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.874
When you look at me
the way you look at me,

26:50.876 --> 26:53.077
I feel it.

26:53.079 --> 26:56.380
But I simply
do not understand why.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.148
Why send me your longing looks?

26:58.150 --> 26:59.717
What is the point?

26:59.719 --> 27:01.385
The point?

27:01.387 --> 27:03.554
Have you understood
nothing of me?

27:03.556 --> 27:05.055
From the first moment

27:05.057 --> 27:06.757
I tasted you
on my mother's lips,

27:06.759 --> 27:10.427
I knew there would be no other,
ever, for me.

27:10.429 --> 27:12.129
No one whom I could truly love,

27:12.131 --> 27:14.598
and no one I would
want to be loved by.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.268
Only you... you alone.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.504
I risked my life
to set you free.

27:20.506 --> 27:24.074
And every day you walk the earth
and are not mine, I burn.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.109
You're wrong.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.910
I do understand.

27:26.912 --> 27:28.445
I know you care for me, but...

27:28.447 --> 27:31.815
But you still yearn
for John Alden.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.418
Are you blind?

27:34.420 --> 27:38.355
It is not John Alden
who stands between you and I,

27:38.357 --> 27:39.757
but my son.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.660
He would kill us,
or more likely kill you,

27:42.662 --> 27:45.696
if he had any inkling of
what passed between us.

27:45.698 --> 27:47.998
Why do you
torment yourself and me

27:48.000 --> 27:50.334
when you know
we can never be together?

27:54.606 --> 27:56.206
I have a plan.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.208
A plan?

27:58.210 --> 28:00.444
I know precisely
how we can be together,

28:00.446 --> 28:02.780
forever escape
that brat's control.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.882
I'm listening.

28:07.485 --> 28:09.053
Kiss me.

28:14.192 --> 28:17.394
You'll have to do
better than that.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.630
So will you.

28:19.632 --> 28:21.832
A plan.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.701
Perhaps you are just
a lovesick boy

28:23.703 --> 28:26.303
happy to while away the time
in a dalliance with me

28:26.305 --> 28:27.638
while the world burns.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.007
I think you know nothing.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.476
In a matter of days, the
French and Indians... no.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.212
The attack will not come
from the French and the Indians.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.547
It will come from inside.

28:36.549 --> 28:39.049
You see. I do know much.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.551
And I mean what I say.

28:40.553 --> 28:43.053
I'm not concerned about the boy.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.354
I know you do not love him,

28:44.356 --> 28:45.823
and I know what to do about him.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.224
Call it lover's vanity,

28:47.226 --> 28:49.226
but I know you love John Alden,

28:49.228 --> 28:50.694
and I will not risk my life

28:50.696 --> 28:52.496
to save a woman for another man.

28:52.498 --> 28:55.499
John Alden
will always be my past

28:55.501 --> 28:58.569
just as she
will always be yours.

29:00.038 --> 29:01.238
Show me.

29:06.377 --> 29:08.011
If you want to know
what I intend

29:08.013 --> 29:10.781
to do about the boy
for you and I,

29:10.783 --> 29:12.850
join me in my chambers, tonight.

29:37.909 --> 29:39.643
Why so alarmed, Mather?

29:39.645 --> 29:44.748
Are you really playing
chess against god himself?

29:44.750 --> 29:46.216
Get up, Mather.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.418
A man can't write on his knees.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.789
And this is my house, not his.

30:02.267 --> 30:06.737
Here is a little test
for you, Mather,

30:06.739 --> 30:10.073
since you know your Bible
back to front.

30:10.075 --> 30:11.408
So tell me.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.110
Whenever a human being

30:13.112 --> 30:15.445
encounters an angel
in the books,

30:15.447 --> 30:19.983
what are the first words
the angel always says?

30:19.985 --> 30:22.953
- "Be not afraid." 
- Correct.

30:22.955 --> 30:25.022
And did you ever wonder why,

30:25.024 --> 30:26.757
when encountering a human being,

30:26.759 --> 30:30.027
an angel must immediately
tell them not to be afraid?

30:31.129 --> 30:34.765
Because angels are monsters.

30:34.767 --> 30:37.134
We were then as we are now,

30:37.136 --> 30:40.704
fearsome engines of wrath.

30:43.942 --> 30:47.978
The most terrible things we did,
we did on his command.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.981
The flood, Sodom and Gomorrah,

30:50.983 --> 30:54.284
the torments of job, Jonah,
Daniel, St. Anthony,

30:54.286 --> 30:55.953
and all other holy fools,

30:55.955 --> 30:59.790
even the temptation
of Christ himself...

30:59.792 --> 31:03.827
All on his orders.

31:03.829 --> 31:05.462
Write that down.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.831
That is your god.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.834
A vengeful, jealous,
sadistic murderer,

31:10.836 --> 31:12.669
and hypocrite.

31:12.671 --> 31:17.074
And yet you plan a sacrifice
every bit as cruel

31:17.076 --> 31:22.145
as the ones you charge him with.

31:22.147 --> 31:25.148
-Doesn't that make you
the hypocrite? 
-No.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.217
I at least am honest.

31:27.219 --> 31:31.922
I do not ask those I torment
to love and worship me.

31:31.924 --> 31:35.325
I am satisfied
with mere obedience.

31:35.327 --> 31:39.162
Bitter,
is what I would call you.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.832
You don't just plan
a mass sacrifice.

31:41.834 --> 31:44.735
You wish to inaugurate
an age of total war.

31:44.737 --> 31:47.337
You cannot compete with man
for god's love,

31:47.339 --> 31:48.839
nor with god's for man,

31:48.841 --> 31:52.409
so you would see
his most beloved creation

31:52.411 --> 31:55.212
destroy itself.

31:55.214 --> 31:58.348
You, sir, are the vengeful one.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.251
All you want is revenge on god.

32:01.253 --> 32:06.456
It might be honest,
it might even be just,

32:06.458 --> 32:10.260
but it is also petty,

32:10.262 --> 32:13.430
and unworthy of one of
the architects of creation.

32:20.705 --> 32:22.706
I like you, Mather.

32:22.708 --> 32:27.277
You remind me
of Abraham and Moses

32:27.279 --> 32:30.948
and a carpenter I once knew.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.951
I believe you to be a great soul

32:33.953 --> 32:36.019
with a great destiny.

32:40.492 --> 32:45.162
My baby! 
My baby!

32:46.297 --> 32:49.433
My baby!

32:49.435 --> 32:50.734
Whatever is it?

32:50.736 --> 32:53.570
It was trying to kill my baby!

32:53.572 --> 32:55.138
What was?

32:55.140 --> 32:58.241
The creature from my dream.

32:58.243 --> 33:01.578
It was dark and twisted,
limbs blackened,

33:01.580 --> 33:03.246
face... a black mask of horror.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.415
It was just a dream.
All mothers have them.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.985
It's perfectly natural
to be worried about your baby.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.353
I saw it.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.955
I saw it as clearly
as I see you now.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.124
And I... I haven't felt the baby
since I awoke.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.293
Not a kick, not a stir. Shh.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.595
I'm afraid.

33:24.035 --> 33:27.204
Did you feel that?

33:27.206 --> 33:29.339
See? Everything is fine,
Gloriana.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.842
I know just
how to take care of you,

33:31.844 --> 33:33.844
and I know exactly
what you need.

33:33.846 --> 33:38.215
I lack just one more ingredient,
and I will fetch it tonight.

33:38.217 --> 33:41.451
And then I will
mix you up something

33:41.453 --> 33:44.721
that will take
all of your troubles away.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.557
You already have.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.326
Trust me, Gloriana.

33:49.328 --> 33:52.529
This baby is as important to me
as it is to you.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.745
This way.

34:08.746 --> 34:10.847
He's here somewhere.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.081
Follow me.

34:14.385 --> 34:15.819
Isaac!

34:20.391 --> 34:23.360
I am disappointed in you, Isaac.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.395
I had such great hopes.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.897
But you disobeyed orders,

34:26.899 --> 34:29.699
run 'round chasing phantoms,

34:29.701 --> 34:31.435
and you've ignored
your vital duties.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.103
On your watch,

34:33.105 --> 34:38.241
treasurer Putnam has most likely
fallen victim to foul play.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.909
I'm afraid you're through.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.379
Turn over your nightstick.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.947
Disappointed in me?

34:44.949 --> 34:46.882
I haven't words
to tell these people

34:46.885 --> 34:49.252
how disappointed I am in you.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.688
I thought you
a man of the people.

34:52.690 --> 34:57.127
But he calls people like us
animals.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.762
Fine then.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.465
We are all good, honest animals.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.633
But you, sir, are a snake.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.603
I know for a fact
you gain from their misery,

35:06.605 --> 35:08.638
collude with their murderers,

35:08.640 --> 35:11.241
and cover up the truth
at every turn,

35:11.243 --> 35:15.879
to keep the good people of knockers
hole down and your profits up.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.681
That's enough. Take him.

35:20.384 --> 35:21.685
No.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.624
Isaac is a truth teller.

35:28.593 --> 35:30.060
He tells the truth.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.465
If you want to remove him
from his post,

35:35.467 --> 35:36.967
you'll have to come through us.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.135
Away with you!

35:49.313 --> 35:51.848
These animals,
they're on the verge of rioting.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.850
We are outnumbered.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.153
Surround me, and let's get out.

35:56.155 --> 35:58.522
It's not the end of this, Isaac.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.362
Three cheers for Isaac!

36:05.364 --> 36:07.697
Isaac the truth teller!

36:07.699 --> 36:10.000
Isaac our protector!

36:10.002 --> 36:12.636
The mayor of knockers hole!

36:12.638 --> 36:14.871
Our protector!

36:19.777 --> 36:21.511
You freed us, Isaac.

36:28.152 --> 36:29.753
We're your men now.

37:53.371 --> 37:59.643
Archaeus of the womb,
aqueous of the tomb...

38:01.812 --> 38:06.316
golden seed of lunar ghost...

38:08.619 --> 38:12.689
argent egg of furious host...

38:14.959 --> 38:20.730
white moon's dark
and black moon's light,

38:20.732 --> 38:25.235
waters of blindness,

38:25.237 --> 38:28.038
and fires of sight.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.442
I have exactly what you need

39:05.444 --> 39:08.111
and I swear to you
on my parents grave

39:08.113 --> 39:09.779
that what we do now

39:09.781 --> 39:13.416
will absolutely ensure the life
and health of your baby.

39:16.787 --> 39:18.521
I do trust you.

39:20.958 --> 39:25.161
I'll do whatever you tell me
to do for my child.

39:25.163 --> 39:26.996
Good.

39:26.998 --> 39:29.165
This is the old way.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.868
The way women have taken care
of women and their babies

39:31.870 --> 39:34.971
since time out of mind.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.573
Now, unbutton your shift.

40:19.683 --> 40:22.952
Now all you need to do
is lie down on your side.

40:56.720 --> 41:00.490
I love this baby so much.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.059
And you're doing
what's best for it.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.808
I'm pleased you've come,

42:25.810 --> 42:28.144
and dressed like that.

42:50.034 --> 42:52.435
Did you really think
I was so simple?

42:52.437 --> 42:55.171
That one little kiss
from my longed-for Mary

42:55.173 --> 42:56.573
and I'd be your puppet?

42:56.575 --> 42:59.409
It will not be that easy.

42:59.411 --> 43:02.111
I told you I had doubts.

43:02.113 --> 43:05.515
And your kisses only gave me
more cause to doubt.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.752
I could taste Alden
on your lips.

43:11.689 --> 43:14.223
It was a farewell kiss.

43:14.225 --> 43:16.192
I told you.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.595
Alden is my past.
You are my future.

43:18.597 --> 43:21.130
I believe that, Mary.

43:21.132 --> 43:23.066
You will be mine.

43:23.068 --> 43:25.134
But you're not yet.

43:25.136 --> 43:29.305
I told you I could,
and would, save you,

43:29.307 --> 43:32.208
but not for another man.

43:32.210 --> 43:33.810
For us.

43:37.414 --> 43:39.148
Come.

43:46.423 --> 43:50.093
Have you forgotten
what it's like to have powers?

43:50.095 --> 43:53.229
You may have none,
but I have enough for us both.

43:53.231 --> 43:55.465
This is John's house.

44:00.904 --> 44:02.438
Yes, my dear.

44:02.440 --> 44:06.142
I'm taking you back
to your lover.

44:34.004 --> 44:35.104
Please stop.

44:35.106 --> 44:36.606
Let us go back.

44:36.608 --> 44:39.776
You can do whatever
you want to me, just...

44:39.778 --> 44:41.110
Just not here.

44:41.112 --> 44:42.945
Yes. Here.

44:42.947 --> 44:45.648
Please me now,
here in front of him,

44:45.650 --> 44:48.017
and I will rid us
of this burdensome boy.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.152
No, he will see us.

44:49.154 --> 44:52.488
Yes! It will only fuel our fire.

44:52.490 --> 44:55.158
I may not be able to change
in an instant

44:55.160 --> 44:56.893
the way you feel about him,

44:56.895 --> 45:00.263
but I can change
the way he feels about you.

45:03.367 --> 45:07.503
Alden will see everything,
hear everything.

45:07.505 --> 45:10.173
Most likely think it all a dream
in the morning.

45:10.175 --> 45:12.475
But he will never forget
what he has seen,

45:12.477 --> 45:15.712
nor will you forget
him seeing it.

45:39.604 --> 45:42.371
Hello, sweetheart.

45:42.373 --> 45:46.109
Hello, little sweetheart.

45:48.712 --> 45:51.013
My love.

45:51.015 --> 45:56.085
You have given me the greatest
gift a woman has given a man.

46:10.235 --> 46:12.568
Hello!

46:12.570 --> 46:16.038
Little one.

46:17.208 --> 46:18.474
Hello, little one.

46:23.414 --> 46:26.549
My precious one.

46:48.673 --> 46:49.806
What...

46:57.648 --> 47:01.751
What have you done to my baby?!

47:05.455 --> 47:09.525
I have done exactly
what I promised I would do.

47:09.527 --> 47:13.262
I have ensured your child...

47:13.264 --> 47:16.299
A healthy, happy life,

47:16.301 --> 47:18.768
one it could never have enjoyed

47:18.770 --> 47:21.070
as the bastard child of a whore.

47:24.374 --> 47:26.542
But one that it is sure to enjoy

47:26.544 --> 47:31.380
as the beloved child of cotton
Mather and his wife, Anne hale.
