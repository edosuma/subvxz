-Tell me what's goin' on.

08:49.833 --> 08:50.933
-Put your head to your left.

08:50.967 --> 08:53.233
-Tell me what's goin' on.

08:53.267 --> 08:56.833
-There you go.
-I got him, I got him,
I got him.

08:56.867 --> 09:00.300
-Don't be rough,
I'm-- I'm following orders.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.900
What's going on?

09:03.133 --> 09:05.067
-We'll talk to you
in just a second about it, okay?

09:05.100 --> 09:08.267
-Well-- Tell me--
Answer my questions,
that's the law.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.600
I have the right.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.800
-41, code for release.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.267
-All right, we're gonna
help you up.
-That's self defense.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.733
-We're gonna help you up.
You understand?

09:18.767 --> 09:21.367
-Yeah, you wanna tell me
what's goin' on?
I crossed the street,

09:21.400 --> 09:23.233
I'm going somewhere.
-Well, we didn't stop you

09:23.267 --> 09:24.833
for jaywalkin',
I'll tell you that.

09:24.867 --> 09:27.933
-I didn't jaywalk.
-I said we didn't stop you
for jaywalking.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.067
-The guy almost hit me.

09:30.067 --> 09:31.767
-Okay, come over here.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.067
-What's go--
-Over here.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.767
-Can you explain--
-Yes! You pulled a knife
on somebody,

09:34.800 --> 09:36.700
so we're just comin'
to talk to you.
-I didn't pull a knife

09:36.733 --> 09:38.067
on somebody.
-Okay. Well--

09:38.067 --> 09:40.100
-Someone almost hit me,
I banged on his window,

09:40.133 --> 09:42.633
I said, "Don't hit me,"
he flipped me off, I said,
"Dude,

09:42.667 --> 09:45.400
you almost hit me,
don't hit me."

09:45.433 --> 09:47.900
I didn't do anything wrong.

09:47.933 --> 09:50.100
I'm walking to a destination

09:50.133 --> 09:52.633
for job applications
and other reasons---

09:52.667 --> 09:53.833
-With a knife on you?

09:53.867 --> 09:55.733
And you--
And you're intoxicated.

09:55.767 --> 09:57.433
-Intoxicated, how?

09:57.467 --> 09:58.767
-There's another knife.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.867
-That's for self defense.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.767
-Okay, come over here.
Sit right here, on the rock.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.433
-I-- I told you the truth
about everything.

10:05.467 --> 10:08.100
I'm tryin' to get
my work schedule goin',

10:08.133 --> 10:10.233
I'm on-- I'm on probation,
like I-- I-- I'm
doin' straight.

10:10.267 --> 10:11.867
-Take your feet out,
just cross your legs for me.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.367
-I'm doin' straight.
-Cross your legs for me.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.033
-Oh, sorry.
I'm doin' straight.

10:15.067 --> 10:17.733
I'm a pedestrian
walking on a regular sidewalk,

10:17.767 --> 10:19.733
where they have to p--
they have to yield,

10:19.767 --> 10:23.533
and he pulled out
in front of me where I had
to lift my leg and get hit

10:23.567 --> 10:26.200
by him, and bang
on his-- on his window

10:26.233 --> 10:28.600
and say, "Hey, do you
not see where you're going?"

10:28.633 --> 10:31.100
And he just flipped me off
and drove off.

10:31.133 --> 10:32.567
-He's got a (indistinct) knife.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.700
Other than that you've
just got-- You got
the marijuana wax,

10:34.733 --> 10:37.067
um, just the regular weed
and that.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.400
I mean, he's at least
got his medical marijuana card.

10:39.433 --> 10:41.833
Still, that's
a very good amount.
-Okay.

10:41.867 --> 10:44.233
So, I wanna talk
to the victim.

10:44.267 --> 10:46.767
Um, so this is your vehicle
then, right?

10:46.800 --> 10:48.433
-Yeah.
-Okay, can you just tell me
what happened?

10:48.467 --> 10:50.733
I know you-- I know
you gave these guys
a story.

10:50.767 --> 10:52.633
But can you just let me know
where it was at, and...

10:52.667 --> 10:54.767
-Yeah, we had just finished
shopping at Fry's,
-Okay.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.367
and we were proceeding
to the exit on 67th Avenue.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.700
We were probably
in front of the O'Reilly's,
maybe 150 yards,

11:01.733 --> 11:04.967
-Okay.
-um... you know, east still
of the exit.

11:05.067 --> 11:08.167
-Sure.
-He as a pedestrian
was crossing a roadway,

11:08.200 --> 11:10.633
I'm in a stream of cars
heading that way.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.500
And as I'm-- as I keep going,

11:12.533 --> 11:16.200
he kinda looks
at me menacingly,
like I should stop,

11:16.233 --> 11:20.167
and we're-- and I-- I have
plenty of time to cross
in front of him, so I do.

11:20.200 --> 11:24.167
He speeds up and gets
in front of us and throws
an obscene gesture,

11:24.200 --> 11:27.567
like climbs over
our windshield
with an obscene gesture.

11:27.600 --> 11:31.433
And I keep going.
He wants me to stop,
and as I go by him,

11:31.467 --> 11:35.267
he smacks the car
really hard there
and causes that dent.

11:35.300 --> 11:38.367
And then, he pursues me
into traffic, and then
confronts me here

11:38.400 --> 11:42.800
at the door.
He starts opening the door,
yelling obscenities,

11:42.833 --> 11:45.133
and he's banging
on the window very hard.

11:45.167 --> 11:47.067
I'm very surprised
it didn't break.
I would say he banged

11:47.067 --> 11:48.700
on the window
four or five times.

11:48.733 --> 11:50.300
-Okay.
You can see the marks

11:50.333 --> 11:52.067
on the window as well.
-He's tellin' me to come out,

11:52.067 --> 11:54.733
he's tryin'
to open the door again.
And then he brandishes--

11:54.767 --> 11:57.067
Then he goes-- He unstraps
what I think is a gun.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.400
-Mm-hm.
-I look closely, it's more--
it's-- it's a knife.

11:59.433 --> 12:02.600
-Mm-hm.
-And he brandishes the knife,
like that.

12:02.633 --> 12:05.533
Uh, and then he hits
the window again, and then
the light turns green.

12:05.567 --> 12:10.733
And then as I'm leaving,
stands back and just kicks in
the side of the door.

12:10.767 --> 12:13.500
-Okay.
-And that's when I called 9-1-1.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.933
I mean, my mom
could drop dead
just from the fear of it.

12:15.967 --> 12:18.700
-Scared her, yeah.
-This lady is 78 years old,
she's not well.

12:18.733 --> 12:20.633
-Yeah.
-I'm like, dude, you need
to just not do this,

12:20.667 --> 12:22.667
-Yeah. She doesn't need that.
Of course.
-Just don't do this.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.133
Just step away.
If my window would've been open,
if my door wasn't locked,

12:26.167 --> 12:28.767
he would've absolutely
been throwing those punches
at me, absolutely.

12:28.800 --> 12:29.900
-Okay.

12:32.167 --> 12:35.533
Hey, listen, so you're
under arrest for disorderly
conduct, okay?

12:35.567 --> 12:37.200
-What?
-Criminal damage.
You did damage to his car.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.333
You jumped on his car,
smacked the side
of his car,

12:39.367 --> 12:41.933
and then hit his window
a bunch of times.
-No. It was right here

12:41.967 --> 12:44.400
as he was pulling out
of Fry's, and I was walking

12:44.433 --> 12:47.400
across, and he almost hit me.
-Okay.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.100
-And I walked up to him,
and he sw-- he changed
three different lanes

12:51.133 --> 12:53.633
to get away from me,
like, quick.
-Right.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.333
To get away from you, right?
-Exactly.

12:55.367 --> 12:58.500
-Some younger kid
pursues him while he's
still in traffic, and he's got--

12:58.533 --> 13:01.533
and he's-- hold on.
And he's got a knife on, right?

13:01.567 --> 13:04.433
And he's showing him--
No, he said-- How'd he know
about those knives,

13:04.467 --> 13:06.433
when he told us,
he called and said
there was knives on you.

13:06.467 --> 13:09.600
-He saw the bottom of it,
it hangs-- the tip hangs out--
-Okay, well, regardless,

13:09.633 --> 13:12.167
he's with his mother,
she's 70-something years old,

13:12.200 --> 13:14.500
and you're pursuin' him
in traffic, and you kicked
the side of his car.

13:14.533 --> 13:17.067
-I didn't unlatch it.
I didn't run after them,
I didn't pursue them.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.233
If they would've been gone
by the time I got to the light,

13:19.267 --> 13:21.167
I would've continued
on my way to the bus stop

13:21.200 --> 13:22.967
where I have to go.
-I'm not sayin'--
We're not gonna--

13:23.067 --> 13:25.067
We're not tryin'
to jam you up with a bunch
of ag assault stuff

13:25.067 --> 13:29.067
and things like that.
It's a criminal damage
and disorderly conduct.

13:29.067 --> 13:33.667
-They're not gettin' charged
and I am?
The system's corrupt.

13:33.700 --> 13:37.767
This is all a misunderstanding,
guys. Like, seriously?

13:40.633 --> 13:42.800
-When I'm not doing
police work, I keep myself
very busy.

13:42.833 --> 13:44.900
I like to build cars,
build hot rods,

13:44.933 --> 13:48.200
build, uh, four-by-four trucks,
and do a lot of custom fab work.

13:48.233 --> 13:51.167
I love working with my hands.
Always have, since I was young.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.800
You know, I was that kid
that was takin' apart
the remote control cars,

13:53.833 --> 13:55.400
and tryin' to make 'em better.

13:55.433 --> 13:58.133
-Woman (on radio):
He had aerosol spray,
and he was using it to get high.

13:58.167 --> 14:04.067
-We're heading to a call
where a white male is supposedly
huffing, uh, air duster cans,

14:04.100 --> 14:06.233
so we're gonna head down there
and see what we got.

14:06.267 --> 14:10.067
-He carries a hunting knife with
a one-inch double-sided blade
that's holstered.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.100
-Hello.
-I'll wait till you get out.

14:12.133 --> 14:13.133
-All right.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.800
What's goin' on?
-He's been taking air dusters

14:16.833 --> 14:19.733
and stuff and huffing it,
and it gets you really high,

14:19.767 --> 14:22.833
and stuff, and then
you don't know where you--
where you are,

14:22.867 --> 14:24.933
like in harm of people...

14:26.833 --> 14:29.467
-Okay.
-And he's doing it, like,
right behind there.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.433
-Okay. All right,
let's go talk to him.

14:36.567 --> 14:37.600
-How's it goin', Brian?

14:37.633 --> 14:39.400
-All right, buddy.

14:39.433 --> 14:40.500
-You can stay over here, ma'am.

14:40.533 --> 14:41.967
-Yeah, stay right here.
What's his name?

14:42.067 --> 14:44.567
-Can you sit-- Just sit down
right here.
-Josh.

14:44.600 --> 14:49.633
-What's goin' on, Josh?
-What's goin' on, dude?

14:49.667 --> 14:51.067
-Can I have that bottle?

14:54.233 --> 14:57.133
Can I have that bottle, Josh?

14:57.167 --> 14:59.467
Josh.
-Can we have the--
the bottle, please?

14:59.500 --> 15:00.900
-Can I have your bottle?

15:05.667 --> 15:07.633
-Get the bottle.
-Thank you.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.833
-Stand up, buddy.
Stand up.
-How you feelin'?

15:12.867 --> 15:14.067
Atta boy.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.067
-We got a 413.

15:19.167 --> 15:20.733
-What you were doing
is illegal.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.567
Huffing the Dust-Off?

15:22.600 --> 15:23.933
Hey, let's walk over here.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.700
We'll just sit him right here
away from her.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.967
Do you have anything else
on you?

15:34.067 --> 15:36.400
Can you speak to us
or are you too high?

15:37.967 --> 15:39.733
What are you doin'
out here today?

15:43.667 --> 15:46.133
-I've been thinking.
-What's that?

15:46.167 --> 15:49.067
-Little bit of thinking.
-Thinking? Looked to me
like you were huffing

15:49.067 --> 15:51.500
the Dust-Off.
That's not good for you,
you know that, right?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.933
It's destroying
your brain cells.
-I know.

15:53.967 --> 15:55.633
-What do-- What do you get
from that?

15:58.633 --> 16:01.733
-A lot.
-A lot?
How does it make you feel?

16:04.467 --> 16:06.700
Honestly, it makes me
feel alive.

16:06.733 --> 16:11.633
-What's that?
-Makes me feel up,
like a "go."

16:11.667 --> 16:13.833
-Up? Kinda numb?

16:13.867 --> 16:16.733
-Like--
-Describe it as like, uh,
is it painful?

16:16.767 --> 16:18.867
Is it...
-No, it's not painful.

16:18.900 --> 16:21.333
-All right, I'm gonna
have an ambulance
come check you out, okay?

16:21.367 --> 16:23.500
-Not painful at all.
-Sit tight right here.

16:23.533 --> 16:25.767
Hello.
Has he been doing this
the whole time you guys

16:25.800 --> 16:28.600
have been together?
-Not the whole time.
Off and on.

16:28.633 --> 16:32.133
But, it's been like this
for about three months now.

16:32.167 --> 16:34.467
-How's this affecting
your guys' relationship?

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
-It's--

16:37.433 --> 16:39.533
-I mean, I can see
that you care about him.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.433
You wouldn't have called us
if you didn't care about him.

16:41.467 --> 16:45.233
-Because every time I tell him
I'm gonna leave him for it,

16:46.267 --> 16:48.433
he threatened me and said...

16:49.567 --> 16:51.067
-He's gonna have
to want help.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.800
He's gonna have
to wanna change.

16:52.833 --> 16:55.200
It's definitely not a--
not a good path for him
to be going down,

16:55.233 --> 16:56.467
it's not good
for your body.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.467
I mean, you could help him out
a little bit here, okay?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.567
-I've been trying to tell him
go to rehab.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.667
He's been saying okay
with it and never going.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.533
-What you-- What you
do here, you know?
I mean...

17:05.567 --> 17:08.600
-Yeah, I found him
passed out one time
in front of a Walmart.

17:08.633 --> 17:09.733
-Does he have family
out here?

17:09.767 --> 17:11.867
Is he from here?
Is he from Las Vegas?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.533
-Yeah, he's from here.
He's born and raised, yeah.

17:13.567 --> 17:15.800
-That's good.
-He has-- His mom's
out here.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.800
His aunt's out here.
-Well, what does
his family say

17:18.833 --> 17:22.367
about his drug use?
-His mom really doesn't
want anything to do with him

17:22.400 --> 17:23.667
now.
'Cause he won't get help.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.400
-She's kinda given up?
-Yeah.

17:25.433 --> 17:28.633
-She's really done
with his crap.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.267
-(radio chatter)

17:30.300 --> 17:32.367
-He's obviously,
just by his mannerisms,

17:32.400 --> 17:34.333
inhaling the chemicals.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.733
Do you think that's
what's causin' him
to go into places

17:36.767 --> 17:38.633
and steal the cans,
and take 'em and stuff?

17:38.667 --> 17:40.800
Do you think that's
what's makin' him do
stuff like that?

17:40.833 --> 17:46.100
-Uh, he goes in to get them
in the beginning.

17:46.133 --> 17:52.500
So... I think if he had
the money, he'll pay
for 'em, but...

17:52.533 --> 17:54.433
-He would?
-Yeah. 'Cause--

17:54.467 --> 17:56.433
-Has he-- Has he
ever explained, like,
how it makes him feel?

17:56.467 --> 18:00.233
-It'll kill you, and
it takes one to the brain.

18:00.267 --> 18:02.167
-Has he ever explained
to you how it makes him feel?

18:02.200 --> 18:08.167
-Yeah. I asked him and he said
the whole, like-- everything
laminates, and... you just--

18:08.200 --> 18:14.067
like the whole city laminates?
And he goes, no, you know?

18:14.100 --> 18:16.767
He tells me never to go
by him when he does it,

18:16.800 --> 18:18.367
'cause he won't know
who I am.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.900
-Hopefully, you can reach him.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.500
We'll have medical
check him out.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.467
Thank you
for callin' us, okay?

18:23.500 --> 18:25.233
He's got some medical stuff
goin on.

18:25.267 --> 18:27.900
-Yep, he's got-- he's got
a couple arrests
and, uh, citations

18:27.933 --> 18:31.700
for use, possession,
drug chemical poison
from euphoria, hallucination,

18:31.733 --> 18:36.267
just like we saw.
Um, he's also got
a, uh...

18:36.300 --> 18:40.533
He's got an arrest,
and he's got a Baker
for inhaling chemicals.

18:40.567 --> 18:42.133
Which we actually saw.

18:42.167 --> 18:46.233
Uh, some other--
other dispositions
for traffic and stuff.

18:46.267 --> 18:48.900
Here's another inhale chemical,
another inhale chemical,

18:48.933 --> 18:52.667
another inhale chemical
so... he's got a couple
petty larcenies,

18:52.700 --> 18:55.233
like-- like she was sayin'
about stealin' the, uh,
the items,

18:55.267 --> 18:57.333
some other to huff
and everything, so.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.200
I mean,
we got medical coming.

18:59.233 --> 19:02.233
-Yeah, he's just not gonna--
not gonna learn, huh?
-No.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.967
-(indistinct chatter)

19:05.067 --> 19:07.233
-Hey, Josh.
I got something for you.

19:09.067 --> 19:10.533
All right, look, man--

19:10.567 --> 19:12.233
you need to do something
about this, all right?

19:12.267 --> 19:15.067
You've obviously got
a girl out there that
really cares about you.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.433
Okay?

19:16.467 --> 19:18.567
I mean, there's other ways
of dealing with stresses
in life.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.600
Me giving you a ticket,
is that gonna change you?

19:20.633 --> 19:22.100
No, you gotta want to change.

19:22.133 --> 19:23.933
You're the only one
that can change you, right?

19:23.967 --> 19:26.433
Is there anything
that you could say
that we can do

19:26.467 --> 19:28.500
to maybe help?

19:28.533 --> 19:32.967
I can tell you this--
I don't wish this
upon anybody.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.833
This curse that I have--
what have you--

19:36.867 --> 19:40.633
I just want everybody to--
be happy, but

19:40.667 --> 19:42.167
I just wanna be happy.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.067
-Hopefully you can find that.
I think you're gonna need

19:44.100 --> 19:46.200
to have a long heart-to-heart
talk with her.

19:46.233 --> 19:48.467
Here's your citation, okay?
For inhaling chemicals.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.700
All right, good luck to you,
man, okay?

19:50.733 --> 19:53.067
-132 and Bush, I've got him
at gunpoint.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.300
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.467
Cover is code three.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.467
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.700 --> 20:08.367
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.567
-(theme music playing)
