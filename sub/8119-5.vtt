WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.040
This programme contains some strong
language.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.640
SHE LAUGHS

00:11.640 --> 00:15.160
'Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys.'

00:15.160 --> 00:18.400
# She's Mrs Brown
Agnes

00:18.400 --> 00:21.360
# That's Mrs Brown
Agnes

00:21.360 --> 00:24.160
# Oh, Mrs Brown. #

00:28.600 --> 00:31.200
I don't know
what's wrong with you, dog.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.240
DOG WHINES
This is good-quality food.

00:33.240 --> 00:36.200
There's dogs all over the world
who'd be delighted with this.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.920
Spartacus still not eating?

00:37.920 --> 00:39.840
Not a bit. Sugar.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.440
What?
Sprinkle a bit of sugar over it.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.440
It'll entice the dog to eat.
I read it somewhere. Oh.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.520
Spartacus.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.640
Now look, sugar!

00:48.640 --> 00:50.080
DOG WHINES

00:50.080 --> 00:52.960
Pretend to eat it, Agnes. What?

00:52.960 --> 00:55.600
If you pretend to eat it,
the dog will get jealous.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.040
Very protective of their dinners,
dogs are.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.960
Spartacus,
I'm going to eat this now, look.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.920
Agnes, like a dog! Here, put it
on the floor and I'll show you.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.160
Here, Spartacus. Come on, darling.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.480
Look what I have!
Come on, Spartacus.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.360
Num, num, num, num. Look, look!

01:15.360 --> 01:17.280
No, Winnie, no. What?
Winnie, no, no.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.960
She goes in sideways. Like this.

01:18.960 --> 01:22.000
Come on, Spartacus, pet, come on.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.080
Come on, Spartacus! Num, num, num.
Oh, this is lovely.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.880
Oh, yes, Spartacus.
Come on, darling.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.400
Come on, Spartacus, come on!
Come on.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.440
Your dinner's gone. It's gone!
Num, num, num, num!

01:36.480 --> 01:37.640
Mammy!

01:42.920 --> 01:48.560
When you're finished your breakfast,
Professor Clowne would like
to ask you some questions. I'm off.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.800
Would you like a cup of tea?
That depends.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.440
Will you answer the questions
the professor wants to ask
you for his book?

01:56.440 --> 01:59.280
As long as it doesn't take too long.
Thank you, Mrs Brown.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.920
I didn't say you could
fuckin' move in. Mammy!

02:01.920 --> 02:03.440
Oh, now, what's that?

02:03.440 --> 02:05.960
Just a computer
to record the interview.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.760
Oh, well, you see, there.
There's the difference
in the generations already.

02:09.760 --> 02:12.560
In my day, the only web
we saw was one with a spider in it.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.480
And if a man had a 3.5-inch
floppy, he kept it to himself.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.360
If it takes all this equipment, would
we be better doing it another night?

02:21.360 --> 02:24.560
It is cumbersome. I could come
back later in the week if you like.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.080
Wednesday night, that suit?

02:26.080 --> 02:29.240
Yes, that'd be fine. Just not now.
I'll walk you out to your car.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.680
Wednesday night. Something
to look forward to, Mrs Brown.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.520
Oh, I'll be waiting
with bated breath(!)

02:36.520 --> 02:38.400
FRONT DOOR SHUTS

02:38.400 --> 02:42.760
Hello. You just missed Cathy
with the professor.

02:42.760 --> 02:47.400
There's something not right about
him. I don't know what it is.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.800
My father used to say, "If it grunts
like a pig and walks like a pig,

02:50.800 --> 02:52.360
"it's probably your mother."

02:52.360 --> 02:54.960
Mammy, is me blouse
on the clothes line?

02:54.960 --> 02:57.320
No, why? Do you need it for tonight?

02:57.320 --> 03:00.320
Are you going on a date
with Clown the shrink?

03:00.320 --> 03:02.360
His name is Clowne, Mammy!

03:02.360 --> 03:06.360
Thomas Clowne, not CLOWN. And he's
not a shrink, he's a psychiatrist.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.840
He's a fuckin' clown.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.280
Well, I find him interesting.

03:11.280 --> 03:15.000
I find Mexican food interesting,
but I wouldn't take me
clothes off for it.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.800
I'm telling you,
there's something weird.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.680
I can't put me finger on it,
but if I did, I'd have to wash me
feckin' hands.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.920
DOG WHINES

03:26.920 --> 03:29.720
It's OK, girl. Take it easy.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.040
Here's Donatella!

03:34.040 --> 03:36.520
Mammy,
Spartacus looks a bit sluggish.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.520
I know. she caught something wild
and ate it. Must have.

03:40.520 --> 03:45.320
I'll get her to the Blue Cross
vet during the week. I'll take her
tomorrow. Good boy.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.920
Look at you.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.560
I say, that brings back memories.

03:49.560 --> 03:53.680
What? Do you not remember
your turtle? Zip?

03:53.680 --> 03:57.360
Oh, God, yeah!
Zip! I forgot about him.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.480
Old Spartacus didn't like him.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.280
She did, more than you think.

04:02.280 --> 04:06.040
I remember now.
Daddy gave him to a farmer.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.560
Well, not exactly.
Spartacus killed it.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.160
We used the shell for an ashtray.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.000
Shit happens, son!

04:20.040 --> 04:22.560
That looks big and bulky.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.960
It is. Last day, thank God.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.160
Tomorrow I'm promoting Star Trek.

04:27.160 --> 04:31.440
Oh, it will be nice to see you
coming out of your shell!
SHE CHUCKLES

04:33.240 --> 04:37.040
God, I remember the day
Daddy brought her home.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.560
She was just a little puppy.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.520
Well, she's not a puppy any more.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.760
I picked her name, you know.
Spartacus.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.280
That's right.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.400
Here, Spartacus!
Good girl, Spartacus!

04:50.400 --> 04:52.480
Yeah, Rory. we get the point.

04:52.480 --> 04:56.080
That was 15 years ago.
She's old and tired now.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.000
She can barely bark any more.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.320
SCOTTISH ACCENT: She just cannae
take any more, Captain!

05:05.520 --> 05:09.760
But putting her down,
God, that feels like murder.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.160
# There was a young sailor... #
Psst! Watch it!

05:13.160 --> 05:15.320
# Who sat on the dock

05:15.320 --> 05:20.000
# Shaking and waving
his big hairy fist... #

05:24.000 --> 05:26.120
Cathy, I rinsed out your blouse.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.360
Thanks, Mammy.

05:28.360 --> 05:33.000
# He had a nice boyfriend
and he liked to hunt

05:35.680 --> 05:38.640
# He sat by the river...

05:38.640 --> 05:41.400
# Eating the sandwiches... #

05:43.280 --> 05:45.360
I'm going to hang it on the line now.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.600
Right, she's gone. Now, the big
question. Who's going to tell Mammy?

05:57.600 --> 05:59.720
Well, not me. Not me. Not me.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.960
Not me. Well, not me. Not me!

06:02.960 --> 06:04.760
She loves that dog.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.280
I'll kill that fuckin' dog.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.680
Mammy needs to be told.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.760
No, not me.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.920
Come on, Mark, you know
you're the best at talking to her.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.920
BOTH: Yeah.
Aye.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.480
OK, I'll do it.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.840
Poor Mammy, she'll be very upset.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.480
Is there not a home
we could put her into?

06:33.480 --> 06:37.320
Then she could spend her last days
with other old bitches.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.360
Well, I could ring around
and check out a good home.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.720
But we have to do something,
and soon.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.840
Maria's right. She's getting worse.
I'm afraid to let her go near Bono.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.280
She keeps trying to lick him.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.000
I was watching her
in the back garden last week.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.080
she was just pissing
as she walked along.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.840
And the worst thing was
she didn't even know it.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.440
Look, she doesn't know where
she is half the time.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.240
I think her mind has gone.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.280
Right, then, it's agreed,
she has to go.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.200
I'll tell her, but not yet.
Give her a week or so.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.600
ALL: Yeah.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.760
Are you OK, Mammy?

07:42.760 --> 07:45.080
I never felt better
in me fuckin' life!

07:48.240 --> 07:51.240
Right. What about the other thing?
The birthday surprise.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.320
Shh! Will you shut up, Rory?
He's going to give it away!

07:54.320 --> 07:57.560
Rory, the party is a secret. If I
hear you let it out, I'll kill you.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.680
I'm only asking where we are on it.
Well, I'll talk to Winnie

08:00.680 --> 08:03.920
and make sure she has everybody down
at Foley's for about 9pm.

08:03.920 --> 08:08.680
But we do the surprise thing here,
right? Right. But in the meantime,
nobody mention her birthday.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.440
We'll all pretend we forgot it.
THEY ALL LAUGH

08:11.440 --> 08:16.600
Oh, I have to go apartment hunting
with Dino. I hope you have
better luck than me and Maria.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.920
I'm sure they will. At least
they're looking. It's not easy.

08:19.920 --> 08:24.120
The ones we like, we can't afford
and all the rest of them are dumps.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.600
Still, it's great fun poking around
in other people's places.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.760
Does Mammy know
you're moving out yet?

08:30.760 --> 08:34.160
Nah, I won't say anything
until we have a place.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.120
Well, be prepared.
She'll not be happy.

08:36.120 --> 08:40.760
I know. I'm not looking forward
to telling her. Would you like me
to tell her? Would you?

08:40.760 --> 08:42.560
No.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.040
Right. I'm off for me jog!

09:05.480 --> 09:08.080
Oh, Jesus.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.000
Have you gone completely mad,
Agnes Brown?

09:11.000 --> 09:14.080
Waa... What?

09:15.400 --> 09:17.080
Waa...

09:17.080 --> 09:18.680
Waa...?

09:18.680 --> 09:21.600
Waaaaaa. Water! Yeah.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.600
Get inside.
I'll get you water, love.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.160
Waa...

09:25.160 --> 09:30.240
Oh, Winnie,
I passed Mrs O'Brien on the way out.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.240
She said, "Hello, Mr McEnroe."

09:35.040 --> 09:37.000
She's on feckin' drugs!

09:38.760 --> 09:42.640
Here. Drink that,
and I'll get you some tea.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.120
Winnie,
me life flashed before me eyes.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.840
What were you doing, Agnes?

09:46.840 --> 09:49.000
Laps. Laps of the house.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.560
You'll kill yourself, you will.
How many did you do?

09:52.560 --> 09:54.400
One.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.360
You've gone mad, Agnes!

09:57.360 --> 10:00.160
Winnie,
they're watching everything I do.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.640
The professor's writing things down.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.160
I have to prove that
I'm mentally and physically fit.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.720
Oh, I don't know, Agnes.
Here, I'll get you that tea.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.160
I'm grand.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.520
Well, I'll check in
and see you later, all right?

10:13.520 --> 10:16.840
OK. Put that telly on, love.
Where's the remote, pet?

10:16.840 --> 10:19.640
See if it is down
the arm of the chair. OK.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.320
Ah, no!

10:22.320 --> 10:24.520
No, you have to go under it.
Go under it.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.360
Yeah, I have it, but... Ah, shite!

10:27.360 --> 10:29.920
Did you drop it? No, me arm is stuck!

10:32.080 --> 10:34.680
Hold on, hold on. On three! OK.

10:34.680 --> 10:38.080
One, two, three.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.680
One, two, three.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.240
One, two, three! Mammy!

10:53.880 --> 10:57.040
Right, that's me warmed up
for me jog!

10:58.960 --> 11:00.560
But, Mammy, the interview...

11:00.560 --> 11:01.640
I'm too busy!

11:05.640 --> 11:08.200
AGNES SNIFFS

11:08.200 --> 11:12.240
Winnie? Mmm-hmm.
Can you smell methylated spirits?

11:12.240 --> 11:15.360
Jesus, Agnes,
I can barely spell me name.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.640
I'm exhausted
from that jogging today.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.720
Well, you're no Paula Radcliffe.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.320
Huh! You should talk.
I've seen you run.

11:30.320 --> 11:34.680
It's like watching
a blind ferret in a minefield.

11:34.680 --> 11:39.200
Winnie, get us another drink,
will you? I can't get up. If I do,
me arse will fall off. Right.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.720
Look, Cathy, there's Winnie
going to the bar. Now's your chance
to nab her on her own.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.480
You're right. Rory, with
your mother there on her own,

11:47.480 --> 11:52.200
it might be a good idea to tell her
we're getting an apartment together.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.080
Do you want me to tell her?
ALL: No!

11:55.080 --> 11:57.640
All right, here goes.

11:57.640 --> 12:01.040
Good luck. He'll need it.
He's so brave!

12:02.080 --> 12:05.720
All right, son? Mammy, while I have
you on your own, can I talk to you?

12:08.360 --> 12:12.800
Sure. Sit down. What is it?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.440
Mammy, I've been thinking...

12:14.440 --> 12:17.120
What's seldom is wonderful.

12:17.120 --> 12:20.400
Mammy, do you not think
the house is a bit crowded?

12:23.520 --> 12:24.600
So it's you.

12:25.840 --> 12:29.200
I thought it was going to be Mark.
What?

12:29.200 --> 12:32.080
Winnie, did anyone tell you
about the party?

12:32.080 --> 12:34.080
No! What party?

12:34.080 --> 12:37.800
We're organising a surprise party
for Mammy's birthday next week.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.200
She'll be thrilled.
Anything I can do to help?

12:40.200 --> 12:45.240
Actually, there is. Can you arrange
for all her friends from the bingo
to be down here for about 9pm?

12:45.240 --> 12:48.800
I can. We're going to surprise her
at home, then have the party here.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.240
Well, you leave everything to me,
Cathy, I'll have everybody there.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.240
Ah, thanks, Winnie.
And, listen, not a word! Oh.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.080
AGNES SNIFFS

12:58.080 --> 12:59.880
No, Rory...

13:02.840 --> 13:04.600
No!

13:04.600 --> 13:06.640
I don't think the house is crowded.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.200
I like the house
exactly the way it is, thank you.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.200
No, I'm putting it wrong.

13:11.200 --> 13:15.240
Mammy, do you not
think that no matter
how comfortable you are at home

13:15.240 --> 13:17.440
the time comes to...leave?

13:18.440 --> 13:19.680
No!

13:21.920 --> 13:26.120
Go somewhere new? No!
Ah, Mammy, everybody else is gone.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.960
I don't care what everybody else
is doing. I like me house
exactly the way it is.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.160
If it doesn't suit you,
you can fuckin' move out.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.320
Well, how did it go?

13:38.320 --> 13:42.240
I'm not sure.
At first, she wouldn't let me leave,

13:42.240 --> 13:44.200
then I think she threw me out!

13:47.760 --> 13:49.360
What was all that about?

13:49.360 --> 13:52.000
They're definitely putting me
in a home! Who is?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.360
The family. Ah, no, they're not.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.280
They are, Winnie.
I hear them talking about it,

13:57.280 --> 13:59.320
and they're whispering.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.800
TEARFULLY: They think
I don't see them, but I do.
That'll be about the parrr...

14:06.800 --> 14:07.920
What?

14:07.920 --> 14:09.760
Nothing. You're imagining it.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.760
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm losing me marbles.

14:13.760 --> 14:18.080
The psychiatrist! What?
Cathy's boyfriend, the psychiatrist.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.880
He's not interviewing me for a book,
he's testing me for the home!

14:21.880 --> 14:25.200
Hold on, Agnes...
Well, I'll tell you now, Winnie,

14:25.200 --> 14:27.720
they'll have to drag me out
of that house screaming.

14:27.720 --> 14:32.040
And I'm taking every strip
of fuckin' wallpaper with me.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.880
Well, now,
here's the man that God forgot.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.200
How are you, Grandad?
Were you out for your evening walk?

14:39.200 --> 14:42.640
Just up the graveyard.
Oh, who's dead?

14:42.640 --> 14:45.760
The whole feckin' lot of them!

14:52.240 --> 14:54.360
Hello, son!

14:54.360 --> 14:56.560
Can I sit for a second?

14:56.560 --> 14:58.680
Is there something wrong? No, Ma.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.680
I just wanted to ask you not
to make any plans for Friday night.

15:04.640 --> 15:08.320
Friday night? We're all going
to be here for a family meeting.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.800
Family meeting, is it?
SPARTACUS WHINES

15:11.800 --> 15:13.560
We need to discuss something.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.520
Do we? Make a decision.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.160
I see.

15:17.160 --> 15:20.080
Then we're going
to take you somewhere. Oh!

15:22.040 --> 15:23.320
Are youse?

15:23.320 --> 15:26.760
Yeah, but it's somewhere nice.
Is it now?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.600
SHE SOBS

15:30.480 --> 15:33.600
Mark, are youse all together on this?
Yes, Ma. Every one of us.

15:33.600 --> 15:38.600
Well, you won't take me
without a fight, you bastards!

15:38.600 --> 15:40.840
What? Mammy, let me explain.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.600
No! I'm going out to feed the dog.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.520
SPARTACUS WHINES

15:45.520 --> 15:46.840
I'm going, Ma.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.200
Hiya, Mark.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.440
Sit down. Where's Mammy?
Out the back feeding Spartacus.

15:53.440 --> 15:58.080
Did you tell her about
putting the dog in a home?
I prepared her. Kind of.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.680
She's in a very weird mood.
I'm going. See ya.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.400
Mammy, Thomas is here!

16:04.400 --> 16:05.680
Oh, for feck's sake!

16:07.240 --> 16:08.680
That's nice(!)

16:14.400 --> 16:17.200
Are you sure you want to do this,
Thomas?

16:17.200 --> 16:21.200
I've tried working
with my mother before and she makes
YOU feel like the patient.

16:21.200 --> 16:26.800
With respect, Cathy, I have
a lot more experience of these
matters than you have. OK.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.040
Thomas.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.280
Hello, Mrs Brown.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.520
Hello, Dr Zhivago.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.040
Mrs Brown, I hope you're ready
to answer those few questions

16:39.040 --> 16:41.960
Cathy was telling you about.
It's research for my book.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.920
Yeah, research(!) For a book(!)

16:44.920 --> 16:47.000
Oh, yeah(!)

16:50.040 --> 16:52.240
Interview with Mrs Agnes Brown.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.400
Female subject aged...?

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
Over 21.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.440
Do you mind if I stay?
Sorry, what did you say?

17:00.440 --> 17:03.040
DO YOU MIND IF SHE STAYS?
MIC FEEDBACK SCREECHES

17:06.160 --> 17:08.160
No, Cathy, you sit there.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.120
Now, Mrs Brown,

17:10.120 --> 17:15.440
could you pick
one obvious difference
between your mother and yourself?

17:17.080 --> 17:20.240
Yes, I could.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.720
Over.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.720
Right. And what would it be?

17:27.720 --> 17:30.240
My mother is dead.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.720
I am not.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.360
Over.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.760
No, Mrs Brown,
I'm looking for an opinion.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.400
In my opinion...

17:45.160 --> 17:46.560
..my mother is dead.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.880
We fuckin' buried her.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.520
Over.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.720
Three out of three.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.440
Mrs Brown, let me explain.

18:03.440 --> 18:08.120
I'm trying to compare things from
your mother's time with your time.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.640
Mammy, Thomas wants... Ah, Cathy!

18:12.640 --> 18:13.760
Please...

18:16.640 --> 18:18.440
Excuse me.

18:18.440 --> 18:23.720
Now, Mrs Brown, I want you to cast
your mind back to your mother's day.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.040
Mother's Day? Yes.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.280
The 29th of March.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.520
What? That was Mother's Day.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.480
HE CHUCKLES
No, Mrs Brown, your MOTHER'S day.

18:38.480 --> 18:42.400
That was everybody's Mother's Day.
Or did you not have a mother?

18:42.400 --> 18:44.600
Of course I had a mother.
And did you love her?

18:44.600 --> 18:48.160
Course I loved her. Then why didn't
you remember on Mother's Day?

18:50.160 --> 18:52.320
TEARFULLY: Well, I did.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.800
She was always so busy.

18:55.920 --> 19:00.840
All those friends of hers.
That social circle.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.720
She never had any time for me,
you know.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.280
Me!

19:06.280 --> 19:09.200
Her little boy!

19:09.200 --> 19:11.400
HE SOBS

19:11.400 --> 19:14.400
Thomas, are you all right?
Are you fuckin' blind?

19:16.120 --> 19:18.320
AGNES MOUTHS

19:18.320 --> 19:20.240
SHE MOUTHS: Stop it!

19:22.760 --> 19:24.200
I'm sorry.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.320
Oh, dear.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.840
How unprofessional.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.760
Oh, not at all, son. Don't be
worried. These things happen.

19:32.760 --> 19:35.840
(I'm not fuckin' doing it. He's mad.)
(Mammy!)

19:41.080 --> 19:44.520
Now, Mrs Brown, where were we?

19:44.520 --> 19:48.000
You were saying
that your mother didn't like you.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.800
HE SOBS

19:52.560 --> 19:55.200
MOUTHS: He's fuckin' mad.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.200
So...how is he?

19:59.200 --> 20:00.520
I put him in a taxi.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.000
I can see the headlines
in the morning -

20:03.000 --> 20:05.160
"Taxi man fuckin' hangs himself."

20:05.160 --> 20:07.440
Mammy!

20:10.040 --> 20:11.640
He was very upset.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.680
Well, you can't blame him.

20:13.680 --> 20:18.200
It's hard enough driving a taxi
around Dublin without picking
up lunatics as well.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.080
Not the taxi driver, Mammy, Thomas.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.560
Thomas was upset!

20:22.560 --> 20:25.320
Oh. Well, maybe he's not.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.680
Maybe he's relieved now
that he's said that. Out, you know.

20:28.680 --> 20:32.680
Now he realises
that he's, you know...mad.

20:34.320 --> 20:38.280
Mammy, maybe you're right.
Maybe he does feel better
for getting that out.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.360
You can't move forward while you're
looking backwards. You're right.
I know it.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.880
Have you ever thought
about becoming a counsellor?

20:44.880 --> 20:48.600
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Cathy,
I'd never get elected.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.400
No, Mammy, a counsellor - I mean
listening to people's problems

20:54.400 --> 20:57.960
and helping them find the answers.
That's what a counsellor does.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.160
That's funny,
that's what a mother does too.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.920
Except we don't get paid.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.720
I suppose.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.560
SHE LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY

21:06.560 --> 21:09.160
Mammy...

21:09.160 --> 21:10.920
did Mark talk to you about the home?

21:15.680 --> 21:17.760
Yes, he did.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.360
I'm sorry, Mammy. Are you upset?

21:23.440 --> 21:26.480
No, no, I'm fuckin' delighted(!)

21:31.440 --> 21:32.600
What do you think?!

21:34.160 --> 21:35.600
It is for the best.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.120
Oh!

21:37.120 --> 21:39.680
Et tu, Brutus! That's right,

21:39.680 --> 21:41.160
stab me in the back,

21:41.160 --> 21:43.880
just like Brutus did to...Popeye!

21:47.920 --> 21:51.640
Mammy, it really is for the best.
It's a lovely home.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.720
AGNES SOBS
It's clean,
and there's lots of fields,

21:54.720 --> 21:56.880
and plenty of space to run around.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.040
Am I Red Rum all of a sudden?!

22:06.440 --> 22:10.560
Mammy, the people running
this place are so dedicated.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.640
TEARFULLY: I don't care!

22:12.640 --> 22:15.920
They go around all day
with smiles on their faces

22:15.920 --> 22:18.360
picking up shit
with their little scoops.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.000
SHE SOBS VIOLENTLY

22:28.560 --> 22:31.760
Look, Mammy,
I'm sorry you're upset. Upset...?

22:31.760 --> 22:33.960
It is for the best. Now good night!

22:33.960 --> 22:36.320
AGNES JABBERS

22:36.320 --> 22:38.720
SHE JABBERS

22:40.600 --> 22:42.720
Shit scoopers?!

22:52.400 --> 22:56.120
Are youse ready? Yeah, will
you come on? I'm in here ages.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.440
Shut up, Buster.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.520
Are youse ready? ALL: Yeah!

23:08.440 --> 23:10.040
BOTH: Ready!

23:14.440 --> 23:15.720
Ma, are you right?

23:25.760 --> 23:27.440
What's the suitcase for?

23:27.440 --> 23:31.200
They're my curtains.
I'll take them if I want them.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.080
So are you ready?

23:33.080 --> 23:34.920
OK. Let's go.

23:34.920 --> 23:35.960
Now!

23:35.960 --> 23:40.080
ALL: Surprise! Happy Birthday!

23:40.080 --> 23:44.360
This is it? This is the surprise?
Yeah. Are you delighted?

23:44.360 --> 23:47.200
You've no idea
how fuckin' delighted I am.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.200
I thought you were going
to put me in a home!

23:51.200 --> 23:54.800
A home? Yes!
Why would we do that?

23:54.800 --> 23:56.480
It's in the script.

23:59.240 --> 24:02.480
Ma, we'd be all lost without you.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.680
I suppose.

24:05.680 --> 24:09.720
Oh, no, Mammy, you heard us talking
about putting Spartacus in a home.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.800
Spartacus? Now, come on, Ma, they're
all waiting down at Foleys for you.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.280
Let's get this party started.
ALL: Woo-hoo!

24:16.280 --> 24:17.920
# Oh, when the saints
Oh, when the saints

24:17.920 --> 24:19.720
# Go marching in
Go marching in

24:19.720 --> 24:23.360
# Oh, when the saints go marching in

24:23.360 --> 24:26.400
# I want to be in that number

24:26.400 --> 24:28.280
# Oh, when the saints... #

24:28.280 --> 24:31.160
BOTH MURMUR
Are you right? Come on, you two.

24:31.160 --> 24:34.520
# Oh, when the saints... #
Come on, like this - up!

24:34.520 --> 24:35.920
# Oh, when the saints... #

24:37.440 --> 24:38.840
What is it?

24:38.840 --> 24:42.760
You know I said we were talking
about putting Spartacus in a home?

24:42.760 --> 24:43.840
Yes.

24:43.840 --> 24:47.120
Well, we can't. Why not?

24:47.120 --> 24:51.520
Ma, the vet said she was too sick
to put her in a home.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.040
Well, then we get another vet.

24:53.040 --> 24:56.600
No, Ma.
We had to have her put her down.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.840
Dermot,
the woman was only doing her job.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.520
You can't go around
whacking professionals

25:05.520 --> 25:09.160
because you disagree
with their feckin' diagnosis.

25:09.160 --> 25:11.560
I'm talking about the dog, Ma!

25:12.920 --> 25:14.800
I know you were.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.600
I was just trying
to make light of it.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.240
I remember the day
your father brought her home.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.360
She was just a little puppy.
He was drunk.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.960
I went to give him a piece of my mind

25:27.960 --> 25:31.920
and he just stood there with
a silly feckin' grin on his face

25:31.920 --> 25:34.720
and this little hairy thing
in his hand.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.160
And the dog running
around the feckin' place.

25:45.320 --> 25:50.920
I can't begin to tell you
the marvellous summer evenings

25:50.920 --> 25:55.520
I had with Spartacus,
walking along the canal.

25:55.520 --> 25:59.960
Me and your father,
Spartacus running ahead of us.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.480
Your father stopping
to talk to everyone.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.960
I sat on the bank

26:04.960 --> 26:07.640
just there with Spartacus.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.920
I sat there sucking
a Fisherman's Friend.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.800
It's nobody's fault.

26:20.800 --> 26:24.240
Mammy, come on and we'll buy you...
Martyr!

26:24.240 --> 26:26.080
Sorry.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.840
Don't be like that, Mammy!

26:29.840 --> 26:31.760
Come on.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.160
We'll buy you that drink.

26:33.160 --> 26:37.520
You go on, love. I want to get me
cigarettes. I'll follow you down. OK.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.000
Dermot...

26:40.760 --> 26:41.800
Come here, son.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.640
Come here.

26:47.960 --> 26:50.080
It was her decision, wasn't it?

26:51.120 --> 26:52.440
Bitch.

26:54.720 --> 26:58.640
Dermot, son, I'm very sad.

27:00.560 --> 27:04.240
And you know
what always cheers me up?

27:04.240 --> 27:06.040
When you do I'm A Little Teapot.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.960
Chicken!

27:25.240 --> 27:27.160
Oh.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.520
Happy birthday to me.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.880
Frightened the shite out of me,
they did.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.160
Well,
I won't be needing that any more.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.960
Go easy, go easy,
go easy for feck's sake!

28:03.720 --> 28:05.840
Get down off the feckin' chair!

28:11.720 --> 28:13.640
FAINT BARKING

28:15.880 --> 28:17.360
Good luck, Spartacus.

28:29.840 --> 28:35.840
# Say hello to the queen
of Dublin town

28:35.840 --> 28:41.040
# As the best mum of all
She wears the crown

28:42.440 --> 28:45.200
# Mother hen watching all the chicks

28:45.200 --> 28:47.960
# Sassy old lady full of tricks

28:47.960 --> 28:51.240
# It's a safe bet she'd never let

28:51.240 --> 28:54.040
# Life get her down

28:54.040 --> 28:57.440

28:57.440 --> 28:59.400
# That's Mrs Brown... #
