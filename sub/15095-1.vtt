02:06.692 --> 02:11.946
Hard to believe it's been
ten years, Mr. Hartwell.

02:11.997 --> 02:14.282
Not yet. Please.
I need more time.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.234
I'm generous with
a lot of things, my friend,

02:16.252 --> 02:18.169
but that is not one of them.

02:18.204 --> 02:22.457
Let me tell you about
a violinist I knew.

02:22.508 --> 02:26.377
The hard truth was
he just wasn't talented enough.

02:26.411 --> 02:28.630
What do you think
he would have given

02:28.681 --> 02:30.799
to be the best?

02:30.850 --> 02:33.351
Anything.

02:33.385 --> 02:35.136
Not anything.

02:35.187 --> 02:36.771
Everything.

02:36.806 --> 02:39.224
I'm begging you.

02:39.258 --> 02:41.609
Please, just another year.

02:41.644 --> 02:43.812
You signed a binding contract.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.480
Now it's time to settle up.

02:53.539 --> 02:55.156
Uhh!

02:55.207 --> 02:57.575
Uhh!

02:57.609 --> 02:58.626
Aah!

03:03.215 --> 03:05.166
Oh, dear God,

03:05.217 --> 03:06.501
I thank you.

03:31.410 --> 03:33.444
Aah!

04:07.396 --> 04:08.512
This is 995.

04:08.530 --> 04:11.015
We're looking
for 999 park Avenue.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.033
Oh, there it is.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.284
Oh. It's so beautiful.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.353
Oh, my.

04:18.874 --> 04:20.708
Nice digs. What do you think?

04:20.743 --> 04:25.747
God. I think we couldn't afford
to rent a closet in this place.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.031
Oh, my God.

04:28.667 --> 04:30.534
Good afternoon.

04:33.555 --> 04:35.556
Oh, my God. I know this place.

04:35.591 --> 04:36.674
What?

04:36.708 --> 04:38.643
It was in "architectural digest"
last spring.

04:38.677 --> 04:39.761
Really? Yeah.

04:39.812 --> 04:41.479
Oh, here we go.

04:42.731 --> 04:44.649
Excuse me.
We're here to see Mr. Doran.

04:44.683 --> 04:47.385
Uh, of course. Of course.
Uh, sign in, please.

04:47.403 --> 04:48.569
Mr. and Mrs...

04:49.655 --> 04:50.855
Uh, we're not married.

04:50.889 --> 04:53.024
Uh, Jane van been
and Henry Martin.

04:53.058 --> 04:55.994
Did my grandma's package arrive yet?
Yeah, I'm on the phone.

04:56.028 --> 04:58.029
He's <i>so</i> busy.

04:59.748 --> 05:01.866
Mrs. Doran will see you now
in the penthouse.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.118
Great. Thank you.

05:05.371 --> 05:07.171
Hope you get the job.

05:14.246 --> 05:15.913
Higher. Get a bigger ladder.

05:15.931 --> 05:18.099
It needs to go higher.

05:18.133 --> 05:21.219
Oh. Uh, can I help you?

05:21.253 --> 05:23.855
Uh, we have an interview.
Henry Martin. Jane van been.

05:23.889 --> 05:26.290
Oh, of course, for the
manager position. Yes.

05:26.325 --> 05:28.726
Welcome. I'm Olivia Doran.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.263
Um, can I get you an espresso?
Sparkling water?

05:32.281 --> 05:34.449
I-I'm okay. Thank you, though. No, thanks.
We're... we're good.

05:34.483 --> 05:37.151
Oh. Let me tell Gavin
you're here.

05:38.153 --> 05:40.204
The resident manager handles

05:40.239 --> 05:41.956
the day-to-day running
of the Drake apartments...

05:41.991 --> 05:43.992
managing the books,
collecting the rent,

05:44.043 --> 05:46.244
general maintenance and upkeep.

05:46.278 --> 05:48.279
It's not full-time. Most
managers keep their day jobs.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.665
Where you living now?

05:50.716 --> 05:53.217
Queens. We have a sublet
on a 1-bedroom,

05:53.252 --> 05:54.669
but it's... it's short-term,
though.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.971
We were looking for
a new apartment on craigslist,

05:57.006 --> 05:58.656
actually, when we saw your ad,

05:58.691 --> 06:00.842
and thought,
hey, we can do that.

06:00.893 --> 06:04.295
We're responsible
and... and hardworking, and...

06:04.313 --> 06:05.813
Handy. Yes.

06:05.848 --> 06:07.732
Well, she is.

06:08.734 --> 06:10.435
I see you work for the mayor.

06:10.469 --> 06:12.153
Henry was handpicked by
the mayor's chief of staff

06:12.187 --> 06:13.438
right out of law school.

06:13.472 --> 06:14.439
Is that right?

06:14.473 --> 06:15.990
It wasn't a big deal.

06:16.025 --> 06:17.241
Actually, it kind of was.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.810
How about you, Jane?
Are you working?

06:19.828 --> 06:21.579
Presently, no. I mean,
I had a job lined up

06:21.613 --> 06:24.365
at an architectural firm here
in the city... Nichols & Rourke...

06:24.400 --> 06:27.618
but it kind of fell through
at the last minute, so...

06:27.652 --> 06:29.987
Mm. Well, what can I say?
This is New York.

06:30.005 --> 06:31.822
Not everybody gets to make it.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.909
Mm. Look, you're not the first
people to come to this city

06:34.943 --> 06:36.661
with some grand ambition.

06:36.695 --> 06:38.880
It's the essential truth
of who we are.

06:38.931 --> 06:40.048
We all want something.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.550
But to be blunt,

06:42.601 --> 06:44.352
I'm not
in the charity business.

06:44.386 --> 06:47.605
I need people who know
what they're doing.

06:48.707 --> 06:50.141
Thanks for coming in.

06:50.175 --> 06:52.693
Thank you for having us.

06:52.728 --> 06:54.362
I was wondering,

06:54.396 --> 06:57.398
when did you have
the foundation retrofitted?

06:57.449 --> 06:59.734
Retrofitted?

06:59.785 --> 07:01.185
Why would I do that?

07:01.203 --> 07:03.237
Well, the Drake was built
in 1923, right?

07:03.288 --> 07:05.640
And the mob controlled concrete
back then...

07:05.674 --> 07:07.691
the Morello gang, I believe...

07:07.709 --> 07:09.360
and they cut corners
to skim a profit,

07:09.378 --> 07:11.462
like, with steel rebar,
for example.

07:11.497 --> 07:12.696
And you know this how?

07:12.714 --> 07:14.665
Well... oh, she has degrees

07:14.699 --> 07:16.417
in architecture
and historic preservation.

07:16.468 --> 07:18.553
She's kind of a nut
about this stuff.

07:18.587 --> 07:20.138
That's why a lot of New York
buildings from that time

07:20.172 --> 07:22.890
now reinforce their foundations,
just in case.

07:22.925 --> 07:24.559
You know, if the city was
ever hit by an earthquake

07:24.593 --> 07:27.711
or a hurricane
or some other nasty act of God,

07:27.729 --> 07:30.481
well, shame on me
if I didn't say something.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.400
"Nasty act of God"?

07:32.434 --> 07:34.685
Heaven forbid.

07:35.771 --> 07:38.556
Maybe I dismissed you
too quickly.

07:38.574 --> 07:40.324
The Drake's got 12 floors,

07:40.359 --> 07:43.227
with the Dorans' penthouse
on the 13th.

07:43.245 --> 07:46.063
203 apartments full up...
some renovated, some not.

07:46.081 --> 07:48.032
Total of 388 residents
in the house.

07:48.066 --> 07:50.034
I thought every building
around here had gone co-op.

07:50.068 --> 07:51.702
Ah. We're the last rental
building in the neighborhood.

07:51.736 --> 07:53.671
Mr. Doran likes to approve
every tenant himself.

07:53.705 --> 07:56.958
Obviously, whatever you guys
said won him over, you know?

07:57.009 --> 07:59.961
I was, uh, sort of lobbying
for the job myself, you know.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.095
Oh. Sorry.

08:01.130 --> 08:02.296
What are you saying sorry for?

08:02.347 --> 08:03.881
Mrs. Doran's choice, not yours.

08:03.915 --> 08:07.969
Hey, it's not like, uh,
you took the job from me.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.753
So a lot of families
live here?

08:09.771 --> 08:12.223
A few.
Mostly yuppies like you two,

08:12.257 --> 08:13.757
some, uh, artsy types,

08:13.775 --> 08:16.110
and we got a few working-class
folks living under rent control.

08:16.145 --> 08:17.895
The trash chute's
clogged again, Tony.

08:17.929 --> 08:19.263
I had to walk three flights.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.065
Oh, I'll get someone
right on that, Mr. Leonard.

08:21.099 --> 08:23.201
Our new resident managers
Jane and Henry,

08:23.235 --> 08:24.952
meet Brian Leonard,
our resident Shakespeare.

08:24.987 --> 08:26.437
Nice to meet you. Hi.

08:26.455 --> 08:28.739
Yeah. Congrats. Uh, we're up
on six... me and my wife.

08:28.773 --> 08:31.075
Oh, what do you write?
I'm working on a new play.

08:31.109 --> 08:32.626
Oh. Broadway?

08:32.660 --> 08:35.613
It's more off-Broadway.

08:35.631 --> 08:37.748
Uh, yeah, well,
let me get rid of this,

08:37.782 --> 08:39.549
but, uh, welcome
to the building.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.635
Nice to meet you.
All righty. Here we go.

08:41.669 --> 08:45.223
Apartment 3b.

08:48.810 --> 08:50.895
Oh, my God.

08:50.929 --> 08:51.979
What?

08:52.014 --> 08:55.299
Living room, two bedrooms,
two full baths,

08:55.317 --> 08:56.601
gas fireplaces

08:56.635 --> 09:00.821
in both the master bedroom
and the living room.

09:01.990 --> 09:03.974
Are... are you sure
this is <i>our</i> apartment?

09:03.992 --> 09:06.143
Yeah.
Yeah, it comes with the job.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.947
Um, what happened to
the previous manager?

09:09.981 --> 09:12.366
Yeah, why would anybody
ever wanna leave this?

09:12.417 --> 09:16.987
As I understand it, Mr. Hartwell
moved someplace warmer.

09:17.005 --> 09:18.756
Arizona, I think.

09:18.790 --> 09:21.825
Anyway, I, uh, I gotta get back
to the front desk.

09:21.843 --> 09:23.127
Your keys.

09:23.161 --> 09:24.995
Oh, thank you.

09:27.132 --> 09:28.266
Enjoy the place, all right?

09:28.300 --> 09:29.600
All right.

09:33.605 --> 09:35.673
This place is definitely not
futon-friendly.

09:35.691 --> 09:37.475
Welcome home.

09:37.509 --> 09:39.843
Can you believe this?!

09:41.363 --> 09:44.332
The girl seems nice.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.067
I like her spirit. Mm.

09:46.118 --> 09:49.904
And she's beautiful.

09:49.955 --> 09:52.206
She's how we get Henry.

09:53.825 --> 09:54.909
I'm back.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.027
Yeah, the 21 millimeter
for the wide shots...

09:57.045 --> 09:58.246
But I'm gonna shoot

09:58.297 --> 09:59.580
of lot of it with the 120.

09:59.631 --> 10:01.198
She's gonna be wearing
the marchesa for this.

10:01.216 --> 10:03.134
Yeah. That's it.

10:03.168 --> 10:04.635
Uh, honey,
will you get some soy milk

10:04.670 --> 10:06.370
when you go out today and some
other things? I made a list.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.089
Yeah, I wasn't
planning on going out.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.473
Brian, please.
I don't have time.

10:09.508 --> 10:12.042
Uh, yes, the 2400 ringflash.

10:12.060 --> 10:14.378
Yeah. Okay.

10:14.396 --> 10:15.563
Bye.

10:15.597 --> 10:17.348
You know I work, too, right?

10:18.567 --> 10:21.352
I'm sorry, honey. You're right.

10:21.386 --> 10:23.654
It's just...
it's... it's a short list.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.556
Fine.

10:25.574 --> 10:26.774
I'll take care of it.

10:26.825 --> 10:28.109
Thank you.

10:29.611 --> 10:32.229
Hey, I met our new managers
when I was taking out the trash.

10:32.247 --> 10:33.281
Yeah?

10:33.332 --> 10:36.334
Yeah. A couple, about our age.

10:40.572 --> 10:42.173
Do they have names?

10:44.826 --> 10:47.144
Jane, uh...

10:48.263 --> 10:50.414
And, uh, and s-Steve.

10:53.435 --> 10:54.935
Or... or Harry?

10:54.970 --> 10:56.771
Steve or Harry?

10:56.805 --> 11:00.257
You don't miss much, do you?

11:10.319 --> 11:13.120
Okay. Take the, uh, elevator up
and start unloading.

11:13.155 --> 11:14.205
I'll close up.

11:14.239 --> 11:15.456
All right.
I'll have a beer waiting.

11:23.248 --> 11:24.382
Aah!

11:24.416 --> 11:25.783
Sorry.

11:25.801 --> 11:27.785
I didn't mean to scare you.
I-I live here.

11:27.803 --> 11:31.172
It's okay. Uh, I'm... I'm Jane,

11:31.223 --> 11:34.291
the new resident manager. Hi.

11:35.143 --> 11:37.345
John Barlow.

11:38.313 --> 11:40.297
Excuse me. I cut my hand.

11:40.315 --> 11:43.467
W-wash that with soap.

11:46.021 --> 11:48.656
Babe, he cut his hand.
It happens.

11:48.690 --> 11:50.608
It was covered in blood, Henry.

11:50.642 --> 11:51.909
I thought you said it was
a little bit of blood.

11:51.943 --> 11:53.077
Well...  It was enough
that I noticed.

11:53.111 --> 11:55.696
And then... he noticed
that I noticed,

11:55.747 --> 11:57.248
and he looked guilty.

11:57.282 --> 11:59.700
So he was drenched in blood
<i>and</i> looked guilty?

11:59.751 --> 12:00.984
What does guilty look like?

12:01.002 --> 12:02.486
Yeah. Do you mind not being
a lawyer for a second

12:02.504 --> 12:04.622
and parsing every word I say?

12:04.656 --> 12:05.956
My point is,

12:05.990 --> 12:08.342
you tend to notice if you've
cut yourself that bad.

12:08.377 --> 12:11.262
You know, it's a different story
when it's not your blood.

12:12.714 --> 12:14.465
You know...

12:14.499 --> 12:15.966
We're not in kokomo anymore.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.385
No, definitely not.

12:17.436 --> 12:19.603
This is way better.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.080
God!

12:46.131 --> 12:47.498
Uhh!

12:47.532 --> 12:49.166
God,

12:49.200 --> 12:52.470
please forgive me.

13:01.904 --> 13:04.773
My attorney's drawing up
employment contracts

13:04.808 --> 13:05.858
for you and Henry.

13:05.892 --> 13:07.242
I'll let you know
when I have them.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.911
Tony, last maintenance report?

13:09.929 --> 13:12.080
Oh. Here you go, Mr. Doran.

13:13.550 --> 13:15.634
For both you and Jane to come
upstairs when you're done.

13:15.685 --> 13:17.219
Let her know we're on our way.

13:17.253 --> 13:19.471
We have some
ongoing maintenance issues.

13:19.522 --> 13:21.056
I want you to do
a full walk-through,

13:21.090 --> 13:22.891
and note any needed repairs.

13:22.925 --> 13:25.360
Sure. W-what's wrong
with the elevators?

13:25.395 --> 13:26.812
They can be
a little temperamental.

13:26.863 --> 13:28.263
The Drake is an old building.

13:28.281 --> 13:32.100
Our water is still heated
by gas boiler from 1952.

13:32.118 --> 13:33.786
I'll be gutting the basement
later this year

13:33.820 --> 13:36.238
and a few floors
to modernize things.

13:36.272 --> 13:37.790
Let me know if you need
any help.

13:37.824 --> 13:39.658
I already have someone,
but thank you.

13:39.709 --> 13:41.777
Sure.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.797
Ms. Leonard.
Heading for the park?

13:44.831 --> 13:45.947
One of these days, Gavin,

13:45.965 --> 13:47.883
I'm gonna make you go
for a run with me.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.618
Hi. I'm Louise.

13:49.636 --> 13:50.669
Jane. Nice to meet you.

13:50.720 --> 13:51.920
Oh, right.
You're the new manager.

13:51.954 --> 13:53.505
I think you met
my husband Brian...

13:53.556 --> 13:55.340
glasses, kinda nerdy-cute.

13:55.391 --> 13:59.144
He's a playwright, and I expect
a successful one soon.

13:59.179 --> 14:00.646
Yes, we did meet him.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.964
You should stop by for drinks
sometime. We're up on six.

14:02.982 --> 14:04.850
Sure.

14:08.655 --> 14:11.139
It's a friendly building.

14:11.157 --> 14:15.494
Actually, I, uh, I met someone
last night.

14:15.528 --> 14:17.362
A man named John Barlow?

14:17.397 --> 14:19.481
Barlow. 8b.

14:19.499 --> 14:21.083
An accountant.

14:21.117 --> 14:23.985
His lovely wife Mary
died recently.

14:24.003 --> 14:26.171
I'm sorry. That's...

14:26.206 --> 14:27.956
So sad.

14:29.425 --> 14:30.676
Jane, you're here.

14:30.710 --> 14:33.428
I am delighted you and Henry are
joining us at the Drake.

14:33.463 --> 14:34.630
Oh.

14:34.664 --> 14:35.881
Wow. What a beautiful necklace.

14:35.932 --> 14:37.933
Oh, thank you.
It was my grandmother's.

14:37.967 --> 14:39.101
Oh, Gavin, darling,

14:39.135 --> 14:40.836
the Crawfords...
they canceled on us.

14:40.854 --> 14:43.305
I thought we could invite
Henry and Jane.

14:43.339 --> 14:44.773
Well, that's a good idea.

14:44.808 --> 14:46.308
Tomorrow night,
there's a cocktail party

14:46.342 --> 14:49.061
for patrons of the symphony
and a performance afterwards.

14:49.112 --> 14:50.846
It's black tie.

14:50.864 --> 14:51.947
That sounds amazing.

14:51.981 --> 14:54.283
Uh, Henry and I would love
to go.

14:54.317 --> 14:55.734
Thank you. Good.

14:55.785 --> 14:57.703
Hey, babe.

14:57.737 --> 14:59.187
We have a date
Saturday night.

14:59.205 --> 15:00.489
We do?

15:00.523 --> 15:03.408
With the Dorans. A-a black tie
thing with the symphony.

15:03.459 --> 15:04.877
And I-I said

15:04.911 --> 15:07.963
we'd love to go because...
Well, we'd love to go, right?

15:07.997 --> 15:11.333
Yeah. Of course. I gotta
dust off my tux first.

15:11.367 --> 15:13.335
What are you gonna wear?
Hell if I know.

15:13.369 --> 15:14.536
Oh, listen, babe, I gotta roll.

15:14.554 --> 15:16.371
But why don't you just
go buy something?

15:16.389 --> 15:17.539
Because I have $11

15:17.557 --> 15:19.541
in my checking account
right now, Henry.

15:19.559 --> 15:21.226
I... okay, well, I have...

15:21.261 --> 15:24.479
I have $7. It is yours if
you need it. I will skip lunch.

15:24.514 --> 15:27.549
Uh, look,
I'll... I'll figure it out. Okay?

15:27.567 --> 15:29.067
All right, I'll call you later.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.652
Bye.

15:49.088 --> 15:51.373
Oh! God!

15:51.407 --> 15:53.125
Sorry. You... you...
you surprised me.

15:53.176 --> 15:55.844
This place will keep you
on your toes. I'm nona.

15:55.879 --> 15:57.095
Jane. Nice to meet you
again, nona.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.347
What's with the clipboard?

15:58.381 --> 15:59.848
Oh, I'm just noting
what needs to be fixed.

15:59.883 --> 16:01.099
Quite a lot, apparently.

16:01.134 --> 16:04.102
Yeah.
Washer number three is leaking.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.354
Anything else I should know?

16:05.388 --> 16:06.889
Well, there's a thief
in the building.

16:06.923 --> 16:10.058
It's not tvs getting stolen
or anything. Just small stuff.

16:10.092 --> 16:12.110
I'll keep an eye out.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.528
I like your necklace.

16:13.563 --> 16:15.764
Oh. Thanks.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.376
God.

17:56.365 --> 17:58.350
Oh, my God.

18:04.173 --> 18:05.640
Jane?

18:05.675 --> 18:07.259
In here!

18:10.229 --> 18:12.714
Hey. You wanna hop in?

18:12.732 --> 18:15.600
I have some work to...
yeah, I do.

18:17.403 --> 18:18.570
So I just ran into Gavin
in the lobby,

18:18.604 --> 18:20.072
and he asked me to go
to the range tomorrow

18:20.106 --> 18:21.606
and hit golf balls.

18:21.657 --> 18:22.741
Sure.

18:22.775 --> 18:25.193
Henry. What?

18:25.227 --> 18:27.896
I found something really cool
in the basement today.

18:27.914 --> 18:29.164
Please tell me
it was dripping with blood.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.586
So what is this cool thing
you found?

18:34.620 --> 18:36.505
A mosaic in the floor.

18:36.539 --> 18:39.007
I mean, it... it's dirty
and covered with clutter.

18:39.042 --> 18:40.542
Obviously nobody's seen it
in years.

18:40.576 --> 18:43.495
But from what I could see,

18:43.529 --> 18:45.097
it looked like a dragon.

18:45.131 --> 18:46.431
Is it original to the building?

18:46.466 --> 18:48.917
Well, "Drake" means "dragon,"
so it's a good bet.

18:48.935 --> 18:51.269
And it wasn't unusual
for architects of that time

18:51.304 --> 18:52.921
to choose a motif, so...

18:52.939 --> 18:54.289
Why would they put it
down there?

18:54.323 --> 18:56.775
It depends on what that room
was used for back then.

18:56.809 --> 18:59.561
In 1923, who knows?

18:59.595 --> 19:00.729
I'm gonna
hit the library tomorrow

19:00.763 --> 19:01.947
and see what I can dig up.

19:01.981 --> 19:03.298
You should tell Gavin.

19:03.332 --> 19:04.599
He kinda shot me down

19:04.617 --> 19:06.818
when I offered to help
with the renovation. I...

19:06.853 --> 19:08.770
I get the sense that he thinks
I'm out of my depth.

19:08.788 --> 19:11.373
So you're gonna prove to him
that you're not, correct?

19:11.407 --> 19:14.326
Maybe.

19:16.629 --> 19:18.997
You know, there are things
about the Drake

19:19.048 --> 19:20.582
that have been forgotten
for years.

19:20.616 --> 19:22.117
Maybe...

19:22.135 --> 19:25.704
Maybe I can convince him to
preserve some of it and not...

19:25.738 --> 19:28.006
Rip the heart and the soul
out of this place.

19:28.057 --> 19:30.092
Okay, just don't get fired
for being nosey.

19:30.126 --> 19:31.760
This apartment rocks.

19:45.241 --> 19:46.608
How you doing, John?

19:46.642 --> 19:48.476
It's in all the papers.

19:48.494 --> 19:50.695
They're looking for me.

19:50.746 --> 19:52.330
I did what you told me to do,

19:52.365 --> 19:54.482
and you said
you'd bring my wife back.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.236
We made a deal. You kept
your end, I kept mine.

19:58.271 --> 20:00.705
Check the bedroom.

20:17.023 --> 20:19.340
Mary?

20:23.646 --> 20:26.281
You came back to me.

20:48.397 --> 20:50.898
Theory featuring maura
Davis' "I wanna run" playing)

20:52.017 --> 20:53.684
Ohh.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.021
Did you? Not really.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.657
Hey, look, it's okay.
Look, I just...

20:59.691 --> 21:01.909
Have a lot going on lately.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.948
You need a 12-step program
for that thing.

21:06.982 --> 21:08.566
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

21:08.584 --> 21:11.035
I can't believe
she did this to me.

21:11.069 --> 21:12.203
What's wrong?

21:12.237 --> 21:14.622
I don't believe it.
Amy just quit on me,

21:14.673 --> 21:16.924
in an e-mail. That bitch.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.410
It's gonna be fine.
It's not gonna be fine, Brian.

21:19.428 --> 21:21.078
I have my first cover shoot
for "vogue" on Monday,

21:21.096 --> 21:23.464
and my assistant tells me this
morning that she's leaving me.

21:23.515 --> 21:25.716
Do you know how hard it was
to get this job? I'm screwed.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.885
Lou, you can handle this.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.604
All right, listen, you have time
to find somebody else.

21:29.638 --> 21:32.023
And if you can't, I'm happy to help
haul a camera case...

21:32.057 --> 21:35.259
Or change a lens,
whatever you need.

21:35.277 --> 21:37.595
Hey.

21:38.763 --> 21:39.947
You're all right.

21:39.982 --> 21:42.316
After all the crap I give you,

21:42.367 --> 21:43.618
how can you be so good to me?

21:43.652 --> 21:45.453
'Cause you're my wife
and I love you.

21:45.487 --> 21:48.939
I know I'm not
easy to deal with sometimes.

21:48.957 --> 21:50.458
Yeah, I could tell.

21:50.492 --> 21:52.493
I gotta make some calls.
All right.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.750
I bought the Drake in '86,

22:32.784 --> 22:35.036
and its doubled in value,
what, a dozen times.

22:36.421 --> 22:40.758
My first property. I was still
resident manager then.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.093
That is impressive.

22:42.127 --> 22:44.045
Yeah, not bad
for a college dropout, eh?

22:45.330 --> 22:47.882
The Drake's come
a long way since then.

22:47.933 --> 22:48.999
But then, so have I.

22:51.019 --> 22:52.520
Well, that's a serious swing.

22:52.554 --> 22:54.188
You ever play for money?

22:54.223 --> 22:56.440
No. No, I'm not much
of a gambler.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.559
But you moved to New York,
got a job in the mayor's office.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.528
That's ambition.

23:00.562 --> 23:02.647
With ambition, there is risk.

23:02.681 --> 23:04.732
So I'm... I'm gambling
with my life?

23:04.783 --> 23:06.400
Always.

23:07.519 --> 23:08.686
Jane.

23:08.704 --> 23:10.187
Olivia. What a surprise.

23:10.205 --> 23:11.355
The door was open.

23:11.373 --> 23:12.690
Oh! I thought I locked it.

23:12.708 --> 23:14.792
Let's go. I am taking you
dress shopping.

23:14.826 --> 23:16.911
Oh, and get cleaned up, dear,
and...

23:16.962 --> 23:18.246
Change your shoes.

23:18.297 --> 23:20.364
Yeah, a-actually, I was
gonna hit the library

23:20.382 --> 23:21.532
first before...

23:21.550 --> 23:23.334
I am taking you
someplace special, Jane.

23:23.368 --> 23:25.636
Hurry. I only have the morning.

23:27.122 --> 23:28.389
Okay.

23:28.423 --> 23:30.057
You're in my spot, Doran.

23:30.092 --> 23:32.226
Daniel stone, meet Henry Martin,
a friend of mine.

23:32.261 --> 23:33.877
Nice to meet you.
How you doing, Henry?

23:33.896 --> 23:36.764
Hey, I hear you tried to offer
$30 mill in a short sale

23:36.815 --> 23:39.066
with the bank
on my waterfront property.

23:39.101 --> 23:40.484
Well, you were in a pinch,
Danny boy.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.553
I was just trying to help.

23:42.571 --> 23:44.238
I don't want your help, Gavin.

23:44.273 --> 23:47.275
I want you to back off
and let me work it out.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.694
Work what out?

23:49.728 --> 23:51.228
I hear that the city
is not budging

23:51.246 --> 23:53.281
on the environmental regs.

23:53.332 --> 23:55.116
Now you're overleveraged

23:55.167 --> 23:56.918
and hanging on
by your fingertips.

23:56.952 --> 23:59.787
I can help you.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.923
I'd rather go bankrupt
than sell to you.

24:01.957 --> 24:04.575
Suit yourself.

24:07.262 --> 24:10.798
You seem like a nice kid, Henry.
You should keep better company.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.939
I'm sorry. Was he talking about
the greenpoint towers complex?

24:17.973 --> 24:18.973
In Brooklyn. You know it?

24:19.024 --> 24:21.759
Yeah. Uh, Gavin,
I work for city planning.

24:21.777 --> 24:23.728
We're in a legal dispute
with that property right now.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.980
It's highly improper,
possibly illegal for me to have

24:26.031 --> 24:27.732
any contact with Mr. stone.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.867
Well, I didn't realize that.
I'm sorry.

24:29.901 --> 24:33.204
Ah. Don't worry about it.
You... you didn't know.

24:38.293 --> 24:41.629
She'll try the two Chanels
and the other Carlos Miele.

24:41.663 --> 24:44.415
Any others you like, Jane?

24:44.449 --> 24:47.418
Um, they're all so, uh,
beautiful. I don't know.

24:49.721 --> 24:51.255
You keep looking at
the red one.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.591
The McQueen.
It's the best dress here.

24:56.678 --> 24:59.880
That was
Sasha's favorite color.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.265
My daughter.

25:01.299 --> 25:03.017
I didn't know you had
a daughter.

25:04.519 --> 25:08.105
She, uh, died
a long time ago,

25:08.139 --> 25:10.007
in a car accident.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.909
Oh, Olivia, I-I'm so sorry.

25:11.943 --> 25:14.144
I didn't know.

25:14.162 --> 25:17.248
That's all right.
It... snuck up on me.

25:17.282 --> 25:19.500
I don't... I don't need
to try on the red one.

25:19.534 --> 25:21.035
Oh, don't be silly.

25:21.086 --> 25:23.587
See how it looks. I insist.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.155
Okay.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.963
Oh!

25:35.434 --> 25:37.218
Oh!

25:37.269 --> 25:41.188
I'm sorry, Olivia, but these
just cost way too much for me.

25:41.223 --> 25:44.007
Oh, please.
I'm buying the dress for you.

25:44.026 --> 25:46.027
You liked the red one, right?

25:46.061 --> 25:47.194
No, no, no, no.
Really, I-I can't.

25:47.229 --> 25:49.313
This costs more than my car.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.514
Well, then,
I guess I'll let you find

25:50.532 --> 25:51.849
something more to your liking.

25:51.867 --> 25:54.035
Oh, no, no, please...
please don't take offense.

25:54.069 --> 25:56.570
Why would I? I'm gonna be late
for my appointment.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.290
You'll find your way back
to the Drake?

26:08.216 --> 26:10.718
I got that soy milk
you wanted, Lou.

26:10.752 --> 26:12.970
Had to go to two different
grocery stores to find it.

26:13.004 --> 26:15.056
Hey, honey, come meet
my new assistant.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.724
Hey, you found someone?

26:16.758 --> 26:19.343
See? I knew you would.

26:19.377 --> 26:22.847
Brian, this is Alexis. An editor
at "Elle" hooked us up.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.933
Can you believe it?
She lives in the neighborhood.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.268
Right across the street,
actually.

26:28.603 --> 26:30.855
Hi. Nice to meet you, Brian.

26:31.907 --> 26:33.557
Hi.

27:03.755 --> 27:05.422
Mary Barlow.

27:13.949 --> 27:16.951
That cafe's where we had
our second date.

27:16.985 --> 27:19.153
Do you remember?

27:19.204 --> 27:22.406
You kissed me over dessert.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.657
You were nervous.

27:23.708 --> 27:24.992
I was a wreck.

27:26.661 --> 27:29.296
You said you loved me,

27:29.331 --> 27:31.499
and I could see it
in your eyes.

27:32.751 --> 27:34.952
No one had ever looked at me
that way before.

27:39.341 --> 27:40.391
What's wrong?

27:40.425 --> 27:42.960
I feel cold, John.

27:42.978 --> 27:45.128
Let me take you home.

27:45.147 --> 27:46.514
What's happening to me?

27:46.565 --> 27:50.184
Mr. Doran will know what to do.

27:51.653 --> 27:53.988
I can't lose her again.

27:54.022 --> 27:55.906
There's only one way
to cheat death.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.692
You mean I... I have to hurt
someone else?

27:58.743 --> 28:00.277
You only said one.

28:00.311 --> 28:02.696
And now I'm saying another.

28:02.747 --> 28:06.617
Look for an envelope
under your door.

28:06.651 --> 28:09.637
You're only renting this life,
my friend.

28:09.671 --> 28:11.789
Make the payment,

28:11.823 --> 28:14.324
or she's not long
for this world,

28:14.342 --> 28:16.377
and neither are you.

28:28.524 --> 28:31.342
Babe, you got 30 minutes
to get ready.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.111
Have you, uh, have you seen
my cufflinks?

28:33.145 --> 28:35.246
Huh?

28:35.281 --> 28:36.798
Is this what you're wearing?

28:36.832 --> 28:39.951
Yeah. It was cheap.
Does it look cheap?

28:39.985 --> 28:42.253
No. No, it looks nice.
You're a lousy liar.

28:42.288 --> 28:45.173
Hey, check this out.
It's from 1927.

28:45.207 --> 28:47.208
They were
a fraternal brotherhood

28:47.259 --> 28:48.543
called the order of the dragon.

28:48.594 --> 28:49.961
Now look closer at the floor.

28:49.995 --> 28:53.464
See the mosaic? That's right
here in this building, Henry.

28:53.498 --> 28:54.582
Great. So the basement was
a man cave.

28:54.617 --> 28:55.683
Funny.

28:55.718 --> 28:57.385
See the door in the back wall?

28:57.436 --> 28:59.137
Compare <i>that</i>

28:59.171 --> 29:01.856
to this photo I took.

29:01.891 --> 29:04.275
Solid concrete wall. No door.

29:07.930 --> 29:09.647
Why would they seal it up?

29:09.681 --> 29:11.515
Well, I'm wondering that
myself.

29:11.534 --> 29:13.618
Oh, my God! I've only got
30 minutes to get ready!

29:13.652 --> 29:15.186
Why didn't you tell me?!

29:15.204 --> 29:16.905
Yeah. Right.
Shoulda mentioned it.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.990
Jane, I'm serious.
Have you seen my cufflinks?

29:19.024 --> 29:20.358
Henry?

29:20.376 --> 29:22.160
What?

29:22.194 --> 29:23.461
What's this?

29:23.495 --> 29:25.797
What's what?
It was sitting in the hall.

29:25.831 --> 29:27.498
Who's it from?

29:30.302 --> 29:31.586
Olivia.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.588
Olivia?

29:40.813 --> 29:42.897
Oh, boy.

29:59.748 --> 30:02.200
Well done, my dear.

30:12.261 --> 30:15.013
Keep an eye on the clock.
R reservation's at 8:00.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.580
Yeah, I'm gonna wrap it up
in a few.

30:16.599 --> 30:18.933
Sweetie, they're not gonna hold
our table if we're late, okay?

30:56.005 --> 30:57.805
So how'd you find Alexis?

30:57.840 --> 30:59.974
Do you not listen to me, ever?

31:00.009 --> 31:01.926
I told you, my friend Maggie
at "Elle" magazine

31:01.960 --> 31:03.761
gave me her name.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.897
Oh. And you're sure
she's qualified?

31:05.931 --> 31:08.399
Yes. I checked her out.
She's really got it together.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.801
Hmm. So why are you
so interested in her?

31:12.104 --> 31:13.438
'Cause she's so smokin' hot?

31:13.472 --> 31:14.972
No.

31:14.990 --> 31:16.574
You are such a liar,
you know that?

31:16.608 --> 31:17.659
Uhh!

31:17.693 --> 31:19.310
Oh, my God! Lou! Hey!

31:19.328 --> 31:20.495
Aah! Hey! Hey!

31:20.529 --> 31:22.080
Help! Hey, somebody help!

31:22.114 --> 31:23.147
Uhh! Aah!

31:23.165 --> 31:26.451
Help!

31:27.652 --> 31:29.653
Aah! Aah! Help!

31:29.672 --> 31:31.489
What's going on?!

31:31.507 --> 31:34.258
Let go!

31:38.547 --> 31:40.932
Ambulance is on the way.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.948
I'm sorry. I...

33:20.983 --> 33:23.401
I just couldn't...

33:23.435 --> 33:24.652
Do it again.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.371
It's okay.

33:57.269 --> 33:59.403
Oh.  I think you
have just become...

34:00.572 --> 34:02.824
A poster child
for Upper East Side decadence.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.743
Apparently the, uh,

34:05.777 --> 34:10.031
the patrons circle like
their cocktails quite strong.

34:14.168 --> 34:15.985
Unzip me?

34:36.641 --> 34:40.511
Hey, you okay?

34:44.900 --> 34:46.900
What's wrong?

34:49.154 --> 34:51.956
I don't know. I...

34:51.989 --> 34:55.259
During the concert,
Gavin gave me this...

34:55.293 --> 34:56.761
This look.

34:58.046 --> 35:00.831
It was weird.

35:00.865 --> 35:04.051
I-I don't know.

35:04.086 --> 35:06.170
Oh, baby,
you had a few drinks tonight.

35:07.372 --> 35:08.723
It's all right.

35:08.757 --> 35:11.875
Things have been
really intense lately...

35:11.894 --> 35:13.844
moving to New York,

35:13.878 --> 35:15.980
getting this job,
moving in here,

35:16.014 --> 35:18.950
meeting the Dorans.

35:18.984 --> 35:21.235
I mean, it's been wonderful
and amazing, too,

35:21.270 --> 35:23.521
but...

35:23.555 --> 35:26.056
It might be
a little overwhelming.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.449
Henry?

35:35.500 --> 35:37.118
Hmm?

35:39.288 --> 35:41.572
Are we gonna be okay here?

35:59.877 --> 36:02.612
You disappoint me, John.

36:02.646 --> 36:04.931
How did you get in here?

36:04.965 --> 36:06.048
Where's Mary?

36:06.100 --> 36:08.935
She's going back
where she belongs.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.441
I certainly expected more
out of you.

36:15.476 --> 36:16.842
It's not right, what you do.

36:16.860 --> 36:20.679
What I do is fulfill needs.

36:20.697 --> 36:23.399
You wanted
to be with your wife.

36:23.450 --> 36:25.284
I made that happen.

36:25.319 --> 36:27.904
I told you what to do
to keep her here,

36:27.955 --> 36:30.573
but you didn't think
the price was worth it.

36:31.492 --> 36:34.193
<i>Your</i> choice.

36:34.211 --> 36:36.896
Now it's time to settle up.
Please.

36:54.264 --> 36:56.516
Aah!

36:56.550 --> 36:59.101
Aah!

37:13.784 --> 37:15.401
Henry?

37:19.039 --> 37:21.290
Henry, did you hear that?

37:38.058 --> 37:39.308
Hello?

38:03.050 --> 38:04.250
Henry?!

38:04.284 --> 38:06.752
Somebody?!

38:21.835 --> 38:23.903
Hello?

39:43.317 --> 39:44.817
Mrs. Barlow?

39:46.687 --> 39:48.771
Mary, please.

39:48.822 --> 39:50.823
Please, please don't.

39:50.857 --> 39:53.392
You shouldn't have come here.

39:53.410 --> 39:55.411
They're never going to
let you go.

39:55.445 --> 39:57.062
No!

40:06.089 --> 40:08.073
How you feeling?

40:10.177 --> 40:11.794
I...

40:13.180 --> 40:15.681
Like I need coffee.

40:15.716 --> 40:16.832
You okay?

40:16.867 --> 40:20.553
I had the strangest dreams
all night.

40:22.589 --> 40:25.924
This place seemed so, uh...

40:25.942 --> 40:27.926
So dark.

40:27.944 --> 40:29.195
That's your guilty conscience

40:29.229 --> 40:31.147
telling you there's
a light bulb to change somewhere.

40:34.401 --> 40:36.535
So I just went to the lobby
to get the paper,

40:36.570 --> 40:37.820
and Tony said

40:37.871 --> 40:39.739
there was an accident
with the elevator last night.

40:39.773 --> 40:42.274
Um, remember that guy we met?
Uh, the writer Brian?

40:42.292 --> 40:44.960
His wife got hurt.
She's in the hospital.

40:44.995 --> 40:46.495
Louise?

40:46.546 --> 40:47.713
Is she okay?

40:47.748 --> 40:48.798
I don't know.

40:48.832 --> 40:50.082
I don't know. Tony said
it was pretty bad.

40:50.116 --> 40:52.117
We should go visit her,
see if she needs anything.

40:52.135 --> 40:53.219
God. Yeah.

40:53.253 --> 40:55.671
Oh, and, uh, and Gavin called.

40:55.722 --> 40:57.923
Uh, the contracts from his
lawyer are ready for us to sign.

40:57.957 --> 41:00.509
So we should, uh, we should go.
You wanna hop in the shower?

41:00.560 --> 41:01.894
Yeah. All right.

41:10.153 --> 41:11.687
It's fairly boilerplate.

41:11.738 --> 41:13.239
Standard 1-year
with an option for another.

41:13.273 --> 41:15.908
The second contract
is your residential lease.

41:15.942 --> 41:17.810
So we can quit any time
without penalty?

41:17.828 --> 41:19.161
Quit or get fired.

41:19.196 --> 41:20.696
All it says it that I don't
have to pay you anymore.

41:20.747 --> 41:22.698
I don't think
we'll be quitting, sir.

41:22.749 --> 41:25.317
Yeah. You and Olivia have been
very, very generous.

41:25.335 --> 41:27.319
One more thing, Jane.
Henry tells me

41:27.337 --> 41:29.538
that you've been studying
the history of the Drake.

41:29.589 --> 41:31.874
"Digging deep" were his words.

41:31.925 --> 41:35.327
I may have said something
last night after some cocktails.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.379
I've been doing a little
research on the side, yeah.

41:37.431 --> 41:39.331
I don't think these new plans

41:39.349 --> 41:41.350
preserve enough
of the building's style.

41:41.384 --> 41:43.436
I want the Drake restored
to its original glory,

41:43.470 --> 41:47.606
and I would be interested
to hear how you would do it.

41:48.809 --> 41:50.693
Of course.

41:50.727 --> 41:52.278
Gavin, thank you so much. Um...

41:52.312 --> 41:54.063
good. Now sign the contracts
and get out of here.

41:54.114 --> 41:56.282
You got a lot of work to do.
