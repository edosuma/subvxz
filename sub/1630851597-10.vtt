00:10.310 --> 00:11.378
<i>- Are we, like, all depressed?</i>

00:11.410 --> 00:13.846
- No, I'm not depressed.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.448
- We're all wearing black.

00:15.481 --> 00:17.283
- I'm wearing navy, thank you.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.952
- No, that looks black to me.

00:18.984 --> 00:20.954
And I got 20/20 in one eye.

00:20.986 --> 00:23.559
[laughter]

00:23.890 --> 00:24.457
'Fore I forget it,

00:24.490 --> 00:27.600
Chase, I know you're trying

00:24.490 --> 00:27.600
to get healthy,

00:27.929 --> 00:29.596
so I want you to drink

00:27.929 --> 00:29.596
some of this.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.731
- What is that?

00:29.629 --> 00:31.731
- Apple cider vinegar.

00:31.765 --> 00:32.765
- No.

00:32.798 --> 00:33.767
- Oh, here we go.

00:33.799 --> 00:35.350
When I was growing up,

00:35.679 --> 00:38.137
she used apple cider vinegar

00:35.679 --> 00:38.137
for everything.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.706
- There's a lot

00:38.170 --> 00:39.706
of good benefits

00:39.738 --> 00:40.973
from apple cider vinegar.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.107
- Like what?

00:41.700 --> 00:42.107
- Tell them what they are, Mom.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.310
- It will keep you cleansed.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.310
- Mm-hmm.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.780
- And if you get sore,

00:44.344 --> 00:46.780
soak in the bathtub

00:46.813 --> 00:48.747
with about a half bottle.

00:48.781 --> 00:51.618
And it'll even take the stains

00:48.781 --> 00:51.618
out of your clothes.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.587
- That's not a thing.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.587
What if you have a sore throat?

00:54.621 --> 00:56.890
- Apple cider vinegar.

00:56.121 --> 00:57.189
- If the dog gets sick.

00:57.222 --> 00:58.557
- Apple cider vinegar.

00:58.591 --> 01:01.561
- If I've got a scratch

00:58.591 --> 01:01.561
on my car.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.396
- Apple cider vinegar.

01:03.429 --> 01:04.763
- A broken heart.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.659
- Tequila.

01:19.846 --> 01:21.781

- All right, I can do--

01:21.814 --> 01:23.783
- You gon' shake it up for me?

01:23.817 --> 01:26.251
- I'm gonna shake it.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.251
- Ooh, listen to that.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.487
I haven't been shook

01:26.286 --> 01:28.487
like that in years.

01:30.222 --> 01:32.125
Oh, I can hardly wait.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.727
- Mama, why did you say

01:32.158 --> 01:33.727
the [bleep] that you said?

01:33.759 --> 01:35.962
- Well, I just say

01:33.759 --> 01:35.962
whatever the hell I want to

01:35.995 --> 01:37.896
because I'm growed.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.366
- You're growed? You're grown.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.102
- I'm more grown than you are.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.400
- I don't know about that.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.139
- What are you all in here

01:44.103 --> 01:46.139
hollering about?

01:46.171 --> 01:48.207
- Your nanny is sitting here

01:46.171 --> 01:48.207
telling me she's growed.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.676
- You're what?

01:48.240 --> 01:49.676
- She's growed.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.878
- Moneypenny? Margarita?

01:51.911 --> 01:53.680
- I'll take the margarita.

01:53.712 --> 01:55.347
- What is this?

01:53.712 --> 01:55.347
Y'all are drinking?

01:55.382 --> 01:57.616
- Yes. We're celebrating.

01:57.650 --> 01:58.852
- Celebrating what?

01:58.884 --> 02:00.587
- Have y'all ever met

01:58.884 --> 02:00.587
a brand ambassador?

02:00.620 --> 02:03.555
- For what?

02:00.620 --> 02:03.555
- You're drinking it.

02:03.590 --> 02:04.757
All of these cocktails

02:04.790 --> 02:07.126
that you're having

02:04.790 --> 02:07.126
are non-alcoholic.

02:07.159 --> 02:09.949
- No way.

02:07.159 --> 02:09.949
- Yes.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.663
I've been given a wonderful

02:09.128 --> 02:11.663
opportunity to be the face

02:11.698 --> 02:13.365
of this new mocktail brand,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.300
and I could not

02:13.400 --> 02:15.300
be more excited.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.569
- Now if we could just get

02:15.335 --> 02:17.569
your mother to drink it

02:17.603 --> 02:21.740
instead of her "happy water,"

02:17.603 --> 02:21.740
we'll be much better off.

02:21.106 --> 02:23.409
- Amen, because tequila

02:21.106 --> 02:23.409
makes your clothes fall off.

02:23.443 --> 02:27.312
And Lord knows nobody

02:23.443 --> 02:27.312
wants to see all that.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.981
They're gonna be sending

02:27.347 --> 02:28.981
a brand person out

02:29.819 --> 02:30.984
so that we can do some PR

02:29.819 --> 02:30.984
for the launch.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.118
I'm also gonna be doing

02:31.840 --> 02:33.118
some promotional videos

02:33.152 --> 02:34.187
on social media.

02:34.219 --> 02:35.889
- I love it.

02:34.219 --> 02:35.889
- That's awesome.

02:35.921 --> 02:40.930
- I look forward to the day

02:35.921 --> 02:40.930
to when I can walk into a store

02:40.930 --> 02:42.949
and see, like,

02:40.930 --> 02:42.949
a cardboard cutout of myself.

02:42.127 --> 02:43.596
- Oh, my God.

02:43.629 --> 02:46.365
- To Todd Chrisley,

02:43.629 --> 02:46.365
brand ambassador.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.768
- Uh-huh.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.768
- Just what the world needs.

02:48.801 --> 02:50.569
- There you go.

<i>* *</i>

02:54.540 --> 02:56.900
<i>I love this.</i>

02:56.109 --> 03:00.800
- Yeah, no, that would make you

02:56.109 --> 03:00.800
look way too boxy.

03:00.112 --> 03:02.615
What happened to you?

03:00.112 --> 03:02.615
- What are you talking about?

03:02.649 --> 03:05.849
- You used to dress so well.

03:05.117 --> 03:07.520
And now you literally

03:05.117 --> 03:07.520
look like a dad.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.550
- That's what y'all

03:07.554 --> 03:09.550
have done to me.

03:09.889 --> 03:10.556
- No.

03:09.889 --> 03:10.556
- You win.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.860
- Oh, my gosh. Okay.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.860
Y'all, please get to shopping.

03:13.893 --> 03:16.429
- Daddy, I love this shirt.

03:13.893 --> 03:16.429
- What?

03:16.462 --> 03:17.896
- Will you buy it for me?

03:17.931 --> 03:20.133
- Son, I would never

03:17.931 --> 03:20.133
waste my money on that shirt.

03:20.165 --> 03:22.102
You can go ahead

03:20.165 --> 03:22.102
and waste your money on it.

03:22.134 --> 03:24.871
- I don't have any money.

03:22.134 --> 03:24.871
I'm B-R-O-K-E.

03:24.903 --> 03:27.639
- If you don't have the money,

03:24.903 --> 03:27.639
you get a job.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.544
I've made my teenage children

03:28.775 --> 03:31.544
get jobs

03:31.578 --> 03:33.579
'cause there's no free rides

03:31.578 --> 03:33.579
in this house.

03:33.612 --> 03:34.813
- You don't work,

03:34.848 --> 03:36.449
you don't understand

03:34.848 --> 03:36.449
the value of a dollar.

03:36.483 --> 03:37.584
- Amen.

03:37.616 --> 03:38.817
Neither one of y'all

03:38.852 --> 03:41.721
have appreciation

03:38.852 --> 03:41.721
for where money comes from.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.889
- Whatever.

03:43.122 --> 03:44.656
- If the good Lord's willing

03:43.122 --> 03:44.656
and the creek don't rise,

03:44.691 --> 03:47.326
I'll have both of you

03:44.691 --> 03:47.326
a job by nightfall.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.427
Pick that ball up.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.862
Get the lead out your ass.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.862
C'mon.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.432
- There's tons of clothes

03:49.896 --> 03:53.432
we've got to tag and hang up.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.567
Who knew there was this

03:53.466 --> 03:55.567
much work that goes into it?

03:55.602 --> 03:57.503
- Yeah, I had no idea.

03:57.537 --> 04:00.639
- I will get Grayson a job

03:57.537 --> 04:00.639
just like I did the others.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.609
If it goes well,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.609
he might be the first child

04:02.641 --> 04:04.477
that never has to come to me

04:02.641 --> 04:04.477
for a handout.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.913
- Mm. Yeah.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.913
Good luck with that.

04:06.945 --> 04:10.500
- I used to mow Ms. Todd's yard

04:06.945 --> 04:10.500
every week

04:10.500 --> 04:11.918
so that I could have money

04:10.500 --> 04:11.918
to go to the skating rink.

04:11.950 --> 04:13.286
- Mowing the yard.

04:11.950 --> 04:13.286
[laughs]

04:13.318 --> 04:14.454
- I just don't know

04:13.318 --> 04:14.454
where to start.

04:14.486 --> 04:15.455
- Right here.

04:15.487 --> 04:17.569
I can have you

04:15.487 --> 04:17.569
employed tonight.

04:18.579 --> 04:22.127
I can expand your world

04:18.579 --> 04:22.127
to physical labor.

04:22.161 --> 04:23.762
- Just get him a job, please.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.798
- Yeah, but I wanna

04:23.797 --> 04:25.798
get this shirt.

04:25.831 --> 04:27.466
- You leave that damn shirt

04:25.831 --> 04:27.466
on the rack.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.101
- I don't see what's wrong

04:27.500 --> 04:29.101
with the shirt.

04:29.134 --> 04:31.303
- That's the problem.

04:42.848 --> 04:44.283
Every time I'm eating,

04:42.848 --> 04:44.283
you always want

04:44.317 --> 04:45.518
a bite of mine,

04:44.317 --> 04:45.518
I give it to you.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.120
- Fine.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.420
You're gonna

04:47.153 --> 04:48.420
take the whole thing?

04:48.454 --> 04:50.456
- Thanks.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.456
- Oh, no problem.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.158
- You want some of my steak?

04:50.490 --> 04:52.158
- Yeah.

- You should order one.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.560
[laughs]

04:54.593 --> 04:56.463
- Are you serious?

04:56.495 --> 04:58.130
- Did y'all start eating

04:56.495 --> 04:58.130
without me?

04:58.163 --> 04:59.466
- You've ordered without me

04:58.163 --> 04:59.466
more than

04:59.499 --> 05:01.735
you've ordered with me,

04:59.499 --> 05:01.735
so I don't wanna hear it.

05:01.767 --> 05:03.689
- I'm not even in the mood

05:01.767 --> 05:03.689
for this.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.303
I'm not in the mood.

05:04.336 --> 05:05.338
- So what's wrong?

05:05.372 --> 05:06.740
- You know, I did the podcast,

05:06.773 --> 05:10.877
and then these snarky-ass

05:06.773 --> 05:10.877
people put comments out there.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.312
Let me just read you some of

05:10.910 --> 05:13.312
the things they've said to me.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.480
"The way Todd Chrisley talks

05:15.480 --> 05:17.550
"proves you can take the

05:15.480 --> 05:17.550
redneck out of the backwoods,

05:17.584 --> 05:19.918
but you can't take the

05:17.584 --> 05:19.918
backwoods out of the redneck."

05:19.952 --> 05:22.521
[both laugh]

05:22.555 --> 05:24.569
Mm.

05:24.569 --> 05:26.358
- I'm just laughing 'cause

05:24.569 --> 05:26.358
these people have no life.

05:26.393 --> 05:27.694
Like, why do you care?

05:27.726 --> 05:30.629
- Because I'm this whole brand

05:27.726 --> 05:30.629
ambassador thing.

05:30.629 --> 05:32.831
I mean, like,

05:30.629 --> 05:32.831
it's a serious thing, Savannah.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.466
I mean,

05:32.865 --> 05:34.466
I believe in this product.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.370
I want to present

05:34.500 --> 05:37.370
class and style.

05:37.403 --> 05:40.730
I mean, not like I'm out here

05:37.403 --> 05:40.730
peddling moonshine.

05:40.105 --> 05:42.750
I'm from a small town

05:40.105 --> 05:42.750
in South Carolina,

05:42.750 --> 05:45.345
and I've always had a chip

05:42.750 --> 05:45.345
on my shoulder about my accent.

05:45.377 --> 05:48.247
And these damn Internet trolls

05:45.377 --> 05:48.247
have really struck a nerve.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.516
Listen to this right here.

05:49.548 --> 05:51.784
"Todd Chrisley sounds

05:49.548 --> 05:51.784
like the bastard child

05:51.817 --> 05:53.853
of Foghorn Leghorn

05:51.817 --> 05:53.853
and Gomer Pyle."

05:53.887 --> 05:54.887
- [laughs]

05:54.920 --> 05:56.990
That's pretty accurate,

05:54.920 --> 05:56.990
actually.

05:57.899 --> 05:58.324
- Did you write it?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.591
- No.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.226
- I think you're

05:59.625 --> 06:01.226
just overthinking it.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.862
You have a nice Southern drawl.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.310
It's a compliment, honestly.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.310
- Yeah.

06:05.310 --> 06:07.199
- And, you know, there's always

06:05.310 --> 06:07.199
somebody talking [bleep],

06:07.233 --> 06:09.235
and you go to their profile

06:07.233 --> 06:09.235
and it's a picture of a cat.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.103
- [laughs]

06:09.269 --> 06:11.103
- You can't trust cat people.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.773
- You cannot.

Baby oil, son.

06:41.670 --> 06:43.689
I love baby oil.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.874
I'm so proud of him.

06:59.351 --> 07:01.553
the value of hard work.

- I mean, what did

07:01.588 --> 07:03.589
your first job teach you?

07:03.622 --> 07:06.860
- I think it taught me

07:03.622 --> 07:06.860
that never take a job

07:06.892 --> 07:08.194
that Dad lines up for you

07:08.228 --> 07:10.396
because it's never

07:08.228 --> 07:10.396
gonna be enjoyable.

- 'Sup?

07:13.500 --> 07:14.934
- I can't get wet.

07:15.350 --> 07:16.168
- Come on.

07:15.350 --> 07:16.168
- I can't.

07:16.201 --> 07:17.603
- What time you finish?

07:17.637 --> 07:19.471
- I usually get off at 5:00,

07:17.637 --> 07:19.471
but it's busy today.

07:19.505 --> 07:20.572

we're going to my place.

You should come over.

- Two. Dos.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.350
- Bring a round of lemons, sir.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.970
I gotta work.

07:44.129 --> 07:46.132
it's a part of being grown up.

07:46.165 --> 07:47.132
- Well, I just thought

07:46.165 --> 07:47.132
it was gonna be

07:47.167 --> 07:48.468
a lot more fun than this.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.704
- You're working

07:48.500 --> 07:50.704
so you can stack up money.

07:50.737 --> 07:51.971
- But I'm working so much

07:52.720 --> 07:53.139
I don't even have time

07:52.720 --> 07:53.139
to spend the money.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.641

07:54.673 --> 07:56.776
you're gonna be sitting pretty.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.178
- It defeats the whole purpose

07:56.810 --> 07:59.178
of why I got the job.

07:59.211 --> 08:02.314
Bro, it sucks that I'm out here

08:10.290 --> 08:12.579
- Like, I see you guys,

08:10.290 --> 08:12.579
and I was hoping

08:12.920 --> 08:13.560
this was gonna be my summer,

08:12.920 --> 08:13.560
but, like,

08:13.593 --> 08:15.161
I'm now all consumed

08:13.593 --> 08:15.161
with this job.

08:15.194 --> 08:16.161
- Well, Grayson,

08:15.194 --> 08:16.161
it takes a lot of work

08:16.196 --> 08:17.497
to get to where we're at.

08:17.529 --> 08:19.598
- I'm 27 and retired.

This is the life you live.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.434

the situation either.

Pause a second.

11:32.524 --> 11:33.759
because when I get

11:33.793 --> 11:35.894
out of my car,

11:33.793 --> 11:35.894
I gotta look like I'm not me

11:35.928 --> 11:37.496
'cause I'm shifting

11:35.928 --> 11:37.496
stuff around.

11:37.529 --> 11:38.697
- You're disgusting.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.399

11:40.432 --> 11:41.433
Oh, gosh.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.903

11:41.467 --> 11:43.903

11:45.938 --> 11:46.972

11:47.700 --> 11:48.274
<i>- Hey, I'm doing great.</i>

11:48.307 --> 11:50.100

11:50.110 --> 11:51.443
<i>After he called in sick</i>

11:50.110 --> 11:51.443
<i>this morning,</i>

11:51.477 --> 11:53.145
<i>I tried to text him,</i>

11:51.477 --> 11:53.145
<i>but he didn't respond.</i>

11:53.178 --> 11:54.346
<i>I wanted to see if you think</i>

11:54.380 --> 11:56.216
<i>he'll be back to work</i>

11:54.380 --> 11:56.216
<i>tomorrow?</i>

11:56.249 --> 11:58.283
<i>Or if I should</i>

11:56.249 --> 11:58.283

11:58.317 --> 12:00.153
<i>It's our busy season and, uh,</i>

12:00.186 --> 12:01.788
<i>can't afford to be</i>

12:00.186 --> 12:01.788
<i>short-staffed right now.</i>

12:01.821 --> 12:04.624
- No, I understand completely.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.793
You know, I'm actually

12:04.657 --> 12:06.793
not at home right now,

12:06.826 --> 12:08.695
but I will look into that,

12:06.826 --> 12:08.695
and I will assure you

12:08.727 --> 12:10.596
that he will be

12:08.727 --> 12:10.596
on his job tomorrow.

12:10.629 --> 12:11.831
<i>- Oh, that's great.</i>

12:11.865 --> 12:13.166
<i>Well, I hope he starts</i>

12:13.198 --> 12:14.466
- All right, thank you so much,

12:13.198 --> 12:14.466
Shane.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.467
Have a great day.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.169

12:19.172 --> 12:20.306
- Sick?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.243
I saw Grayson this morning.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.677
He had his uniform on,

12:24.711 --> 12:26.946
ready to go to work,

12:24.711 --> 12:26.946
looked great.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.215
Never said one thing about

12:26.980 --> 12:29.215
anything being wrong with him,

12:29.249 --> 12:30.783
feeling bad, nothing.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.519
- I know what he's doing.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.519
He's playing hooky.

12:33.552 --> 12:36.389
- I mean, why would

12:33.552 --> 12:36.389
he play hooky from his job?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.691
- You know,

12:36.423 --> 12:37.691
it really pisses me off

12:37.724 --> 12:39.558
because I actually vouched

12:37.724 --> 12:39.558
for Grayson.

12:39.591 --> 12:41.760
You know what

12:39.591 --> 12:41.760
I'm curious about,

12:41.794 --> 12:43.196
is how he's gonna

12:41.794 --> 12:43.196
walk in that door

12:43.229 --> 12:45.597
and look us in the face

12:43.229 --> 12:45.597
and lie to us.

12:45.631 --> 12:47.600
- Like he's been on his job.

12:45.631 --> 12:47.600
- Yeah.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.436
- I hope they give him

12:47.634 --> 12:49.436
a double shift.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.904
- You know, listen, it's hard,

12:49.469 --> 12:51.904
Julie, you know,

12:51.937 --> 12:54.106
when you're almost perfect

12:51.937 --> 12:54.106
and you make a mistake

12:54.106 --> 12:56.275
because then you live with it

12:54.106 --> 12:56.275
for the rest of your life.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.445
And I've had one or two

12:56.308 --> 12:58.445
of those moments.

12:58.477 --> 12:59.678
- You know, Todd, I would love

12:59.712 --> 13:01.815
to meet the person

12:59.712 --> 13:01.815
that you think you are.

13:08.922 --> 13:09.722
<i>- Got some water, Mama.</i>

13:09.755 --> 13:11.725
- I hate plain water.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.360
- [laughs]

13:13.393 --> 13:15.950
- You are 76 years old.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.629
- She needs to be drinking

13:15.128 --> 13:16.629
at least

13:16.663 --> 13:19.990
eight bottles of water a day.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.869
- Put me some happy juice,

13:19.131 --> 13:22.869
and I might drink 10 or 12.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.537
- No, you'll be passed out.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.730
- [laughing]

13:24.571 --> 13:27.730
Exactly.

Hey, bud.

- Where you going?

13:30.876 --> 13:32.245
- Upstairs.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.947
- You don't just walk

13:32.278 --> 13:33.947
into a house...

13:33.980 --> 13:35.248
- Hey, buddy.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.248
- And not say hello.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.448
What is wrong with you?

13:36.482 --> 13:37.716
- I'm tired.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.850
- Tired?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.850
- Yeah.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.888
- Oh, Lord have mercy.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.888
You don't know what that is.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.255
- I've been working all day.

13:43.288 --> 13:46.493
- My son, the go-getter.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.528
Do you have any idea

13:46.525 --> 13:49.528
how proud I am of you?

13:50.797 --> 13:53.667
I mean, 15, working.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.235
- Mm-hmm.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.235
- Yeah.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.636
So what all did you do today?

13:57.671 --> 13:59.739
- Well, I mowed the grass.

13:59.773 --> 14:02.908
- Well, you look awful clean

13:59.773 --> 14:02.908
to have mowed grass.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.769
- Right?

14:04.110 --> 14:05.912
- What makes me upset

14:05.945 --> 14:08.347
is not even the fact

14:05.945 --> 14:08.347
that he played hooky,

14:08.380 --> 14:10.500
but the bigger issue is,

14:10.500 --> 14:11.784
is that he's going

14:10.500 --> 14:11.784
to lie about it.

14:11.817 --> 14:13.519
- Yeah, I don't like the lie.

14:11.817 --> 14:13.519
- No.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.221
- I mean, if he's gonna lie,

14:15.254 --> 14:18.457
I would prefer

14:15.254 --> 14:18.457
he lie about, you know--

14:18.490 --> 14:20.125
- Not lie at all.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.125
How 'bout that?

14:20.159 --> 14:22.195
- Yeah, what she said.

14:22.227 --> 14:24.563
What else did you do?

14:22.227 --> 14:24.563
- I bussed some tables.

14:24.596 --> 14:26.732
- Is that before

14:24.596 --> 14:26.732
you cut grass or after?

14:26.765 --> 14:27.900
- Before.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.101
- Son, there ain't

14:27.933 --> 14:29.101
nothing worse

14:29.134 --> 14:31.604
than somebody's that's a liar.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.639
- What do you mean?

14:32.672 --> 14:34.573
- It means

14:32.672 --> 14:34.573
that before you got home

14:34.606 --> 14:36.375
to tell your lie,

14:36.408 --> 14:38.977

14:47.153 --> 14:48.455
- Grayson, what's going on?

14:48.488 --> 14:50.899
- Well, all my friends

14:48.488 --> 14:50.899
were there at the pool,

14:50.899 --> 14:52.359
and I was just working

14:50.899 --> 14:52.359
the entire time.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.494
So I called in sick

14:52.392 --> 14:54.494
to hang out with them.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.129
And it's embarrassing.

14:56.162 --> 14:59.990
- Embarrassing to have a job?

14:56.162 --> 14:59.990
- You should feel good.

14:59.131 --> 15:00.833
- But all my friends

14:59.131 --> 15:00.833
are at the pool.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.201
I'm wasting my summer.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.403
- No, honey,

15:02.235 --> 15:04.403
you're not wasting your summer.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.206
You're working.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.206
You're making money.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.740
You're building character.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.708
- You're better than that.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.811
- Are you gonna tell

15:09.743 --> 15:11.811
my manager?

15:11.845 --> 15:13.913
- I'm not gonna do anything.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.715
Because I still have hope

15:15.749 --> 15:17.716
that you're going to do

15:19.519 --> 15:21.553
you have Shane

- Mama!

15:24.570 --> 15:26.259

15:26.292 --> 15:27.961
that kind of money, Nanny.

15:28.610 --> 15:29.596
- Well, then,

17:13.666 --> 17:15.934
- I mean, if you were

17:13.666 --> 17:15.934
gonna change something,

17:16.359 --> 17:17.703
that wouldn't be

17:16.359 --> 17:17.703
the top of your list.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.606
It would be the fact that

17:17.737 --> 17:20.606
you always have to be right,

17:20.640 --> 17:21.708
that you're bossy,

17:21.740 --> 17:24.144
you're opinionated,

17:21.740 --> 17:24.144
you're picky.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.246
- You had that list

17:24.176 --> 17:26.246
put together, didn't you?

17:26.278 --> 17:28.248
- Oh, it's always in my head.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.449
- Here's your food.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.449
- Hey.

17:29.481 --> 17:30.950
- Get the menus out.

17:29.481 --> 17:30.950
- Thank you.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.519
- So we have

17:31.509 --> 17:32.519
the steak tartare...

17:32.551 --> 17:35.154
- Mm-hmm.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.154
- And escargot de bourgogne.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.623
- Okay.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.623
- Bon appétit.

17:36.655 --> 17:38.424
- Thank you so much.

17:36.655 --> 17:38.424
- Thank you.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.492
Oh, God, I don't even know

17:38.458 --> 17:40.492
how to eat this.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.327
- Just put it in your mouth.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.663
- That's, like, looking at me,

17:42.362 --> 17:44.663
and I don't want to.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.766
[exhales sharply]

17:46.799 --> 17:48.634
- Those were snails.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.872
- I ain't never been

17:50.836 --> 17:52.872
hungry enough to eat that.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.214

18:02.248 --> 18:03.750
- You said you knew

18:02.248 --> 18:03.750
how to do it.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.151
- No, I didn't.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.151
I said I didn't know how.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.353
- You said you--

18:05.184 --> 18:06.353
- Oh!

18:06.385 --> 18:07.686
- Uh-huh.

18:06.385 --> 18:07.686
- You got a ball flying.

18:07.721 --> 18:09.556
- Mm-hmm, well, you out.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.124
- [laughs]

18:11.156 --> 18:12.759
- Hey, sir.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.759
How are you?

18:12.791 --> 18:14.827
- Hey, buddy.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.827
- Good.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.296
- He scratched.

18:16.328 --> 18:17.364
- You sure you got it?

18:17.396 --> 18:19.132
- That looks so good, Gray.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.300
- Wow.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.103
- Thank you.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.103
- You're welcome.

18:23.135 --> 18:24.938
- How's it going?

18:23.135 --> 18:24.938
- It's going good.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.940
- Are you over the stomach bug

18:25.380 --> 18:26.940
that you had?

18:27.400 --> 18:28.307
- Yeah, I deserve all that,

18:28.340 --> 18:29.709
but I just wanna say I'm sorry

18:29.742 --> 18:31.411
for skipping out on work

18:29.742 --> 18:31.411
the other day.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.460
- Okay, well, it takes a man

18:33.460 --> 18:34.381
to be able to acknowledge

18:33.460 --> 18:34.381
when they're wrong.

18:34.413 --> 18:37.182
I appreciate that.

18:34.413 --> 18:37.182
Did you talk to your manager?

18:37.217 --> 18:40.529
- Yeah, I talked to Shane,

18:37.217 --> 18:40.529
and I still got my job.

18:40.529 --> 18:42.788
But I'm on garbage duty

18:40.529 --> 18:42.788
for a little bit probation.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.490
- [laughs]

18:44.523 --> 18:45.759
- Well, I'll you one thing.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.727
It's better to be able

18:45.791 --> 18:47.727
to take the trash out

18:47.760 --> 18:49.796
and have a job

18:47.760 --> 18:49.796
than to be unemployed.

18:49.828 --> 18:51.970
- Exactly.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.465
- I could not be more proud

18:51.131 --> 18:53.465
of Grayson

18:53.500 --> 18:57.569
taking the initiative

18:53.500 --> 18:57.569
to go and correct his wrongs

18:57.604 --> 19:00.140
because that was

18:57.604 --> 19:00.140
a learning moment for my child.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.642
- Absolutely.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.642
And showed a lot of maturity.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.444
- Yes, and, I mean, it shows

19:02.675 --> 19:05.444
that Grayson's way better

19:05.478 --> 19:06.613
than what I was at that age

19:06.645 --> 19:08.515
because I actually never spoke

19:08.548 --> 19:11.116
to my supervisors after I left.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.252
I actually didn't speak to them

19:11.151 --> 19:13.252
before I left.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.655
If you could just bring us

19:14.453 --> 19:16.655
some more sour cream

19:16.690 --> 19:18.557
and some pico and some salt

19:18.590 --> 19:20.626
and maybe top the glasses off,

19:18.590 --> 19:20.626
that'd be great.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.795
- And then

19:20.660 --> 19:21.795
when you get a chance,

19:21.827 --> 19:23.262
can you go to my locker

19:21.827 --> 19:23.262
and make sure

19:23.296 --> 19:24.329
that all of my clothes

19:23.296 --> 19:24.329
have been steamed.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.932
Thank you.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.932
- Yeah, thank you.

19:26.319 --> 19:27.599
- And don't forget the drinks.

19:26.319 --> 19:27.599
- Thank you.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.568
- Yes, extra ice

19:27.634 --> 19:29.568
would be great.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.903
Thank you.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.739
- [laughing]

19:30.936 --> 19:32.739
- He's mad as hell.

19:32.771 --> 19:35.208
- He's so mad.

19:32.771 --> 19:35.208
It's okay, though.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.487

19:47.519 --> 19:49.655

19:49.689 --> 19:52.258
I love a meat and three.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.258
- Me too.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.961
- A meat, and you've got

19:52.291 --> 19:54.961
three vegetables here.

19:55.609 --> 19:56.528
- You're gonna have

19:55.609 --> 19:56.528
a meat and three?

19:56.563 --> 19:58.640
- I might have a meat and four.

And Mama, thank you

19:59.432 --> 20:01.500
for picking this stuff up.

- Oh, no.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.801
- You're welcome.

20:02.836 --> 20:05.380
- And I wanna thank you

20:05.710 --> 20:08.141
for kind of giving me

20:05.710 --> 20:08.141
the support that I needed

20:08.173 --> 20:10.542
and saying the things

20:08.173 --> 20:10.542
that I needed to hear.

20:10.576 --> 20:12.545
- But don't forget

20:10.576 --> 20:12.545
where you come from.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.814
It made you who you really are.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.817
Yeah, but I wanna thank you

20:14.847 --> 20:17.817
for being you,

20:17.851 --> 20:19.885
not nobody else.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.153
- I mean, I will admit,

20:19.919 --> 20:21.153
you know,

20:21.186 --> 20:23.222
some of the negative comments

20:21.186 --> 20:23.222
on the podcast

20:23.256 --> 20:25.392
about the way that I speak,

20:23.256 --> 20:25.392
you know,

20:25.424 --> 20:27.394
that had gotten into my head.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.627
For that, I'm sorry,

20:28.661 --> 20:30.997
and they agreed to let me

20:28.661 --> 20:30.997
shoot another video.

20:31.309 --> 20:33.990
And how good is it?

20:31.309 --> 20:33.990
- It's great.

20:33.133 --> 20:36.690
- And it's great

20:33.133 --> 20:36.690
because we are who we are.

- Right.
