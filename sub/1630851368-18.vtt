1:03:55.346 --> 1:03:58.213
<i>If I get the call, 100%,</i>

1:03:58.214 --> 1:03:59.477
I'm back, baby.

1:03:59.478 --> 1:04:03.445
<i>[speaking native language]</i>

1:04:06.581 --> 1:04:07.515
- We're going kind of slow.

1:04:07.516 --> 1:04:08.679
We could pick it up
\h\h\ha little bit.

1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:09.712
- All right, go.
[bleep] go, then.

1:04:09.713 --> 1:04:10.877
<i>- It's a final.
\hMove your ass.</i>

1:04:10.878 --> 1:04:11.976
- We could catch her.

1:04:11.977 --> 1:04:12.878
<i>- Anything can happen.</i>

1:04:12.879 --> 1:04:16.009
<i>For the first time out,
I'm behind in the team.</i>

1:04:16.010 --> 1:04:17.075
- It is elimination time.

1:04:17.076 --> 1:04:19.547
You must now face off
\h\hwith each other.

1:04:19.548 --> 1:04:21.349
<i>- I am scared right now.</i>

1:04:21.350 --> 1:04:22.415
- I'm falling.
\h\h\h\h\h-Go!

1:04:22.416 --> 1:04:23.679
<i>- I'm about to die.</i>

1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:25.515
\h\h\h\h\h-No!
- Come on, Emy!
