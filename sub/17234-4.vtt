WEBVTT

00:02.269 --> 00:03.834
<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:03.835 --> 00:05.086
I can't sing.

00:05.087 --> 00:08.218
My vocal cords just aren't
the same since the accident.

00:08.219 --> 00:09.828
I'm your court-appointed attorney.

00:09.829 --> 00:11.186
She was the one behind the wheel.

00:11.582 --> 00:13.763
From nothing to Nashville in just 12 weeks.

00:13.764 --> 00:14.996
I hope you enjoy this song

00:14.997 --> 00:16.812
by the best songwriter in Nashville.

00:17.113 --> 00:18.661
The Wentworth family, huh?

00:18.662 --> 00:19.985
Private
one-night-only concert.

00:19.986 --> 00:21.941
I think that you might be my father.

00:21.942 --> 00:24.221
You lied to Deacon and to me!

00:24.222 --> 00:25.779
I'm not interested in helping make

00:25.780 --> 00:27.977
any sort of case against my father.

00:27.978 --> 00:29.784
There's evidence to support his involvement

00:29.785 --> 00:31.351
with your mother's death.

00:32.247 --> 00:34.665
<i>* At the end of the day *</i>

00:35.254 --> 00:37.707
<i>* Lord, I pray *</i>

00:38.358 --> 00:41.307
<i>* I have a life that's good *</i>

00:41.308 --> 00:42.913
Yes, she would have
loved you girls. Hey, hon.

00:42.914 --> 00:44.708
- What?
- Can you come join us?

00:44.709 --> 00:46.454
<i>I'm kinda listening to something.</i>

00:46.455 --> 00:49.413
I can see that. What could be so fantastic

00:49.414 --> 00:51.132
that it would keep you from being with us?

00:51.133 --> 00:53.177
Well... One of Deacon's songs.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.052
I'm listening to "A Life That's Good".

00:55.748 --> 00:58.397
- Did he write that about you?
- Yes, he did.

00:58.398 --> 01:00.442
Why don't you come join us?
We'll talk about it another time.

01:00.443 --> 01:01.535
Come on, honey.

01:01.536 --> 01:03.304
We're here for my mom's birthday.

01:04.435 --> 01:06.280
I didn't even know grandma.

01:06.281 --> 01:07.993
I know. I think it's nice for y'all to have

01:07.994 --> 01:09.192
a relationship with her.

01:09.193 --> 01:10.808
She's an important part of our family.

01:13.166 --> 01:14.918
Hey, I've got an idea.

01:14.919 --> 01:16.382
Why don't y'all be my dates this year

01:16.383 --> 01:18.107
for the symphony gala?

01:18.108 --> 01:19.496
You can listen to beautiful music,

01:19.497 --> 01:21.250
- be the princesses at the ball.
- Yes!

01:21.251 --> 01:22.667
You don't have to come,

01:22.668 --> 01:24.745
but I think you might
like it. What do you think?

01:25.479 --> 01:26.804
Big whoop.

01:30.772 --> 01:32.270
Well, I wanna go.

01:32.271 --> 01:34.048
Oh, we're goin', all right.

01:35.126 --> 01:37.940
<i>* Hey, Doreen, we know what you've seen *</i>

01:40.379 --> 01:42.687
I'm definitely paying you too much.

01:42.688 --> 01:43.778
Not mine.

01:44.331 --> 01:45.992
Yours.

01:45.993 --> 01:47.003
Guy who dropped it off said it was

01:47.004 --> 01:49.017
"a thank you gift from Charlie Wentworth".

01:49.018 --> 01:51.039
As if the million-dollar paycheck

01:51.040 --> 01:52.499
wasn't thanks enough.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.491
I guess he liked my performance.

01:54.492 --> 01:55.894
Nothing like a fan with money.

01:55.895 --> 01:57.155
I'm more interested in the fans

01:57.156 --> 01:58.876
who are actually buying my music.

01:58.877 --> 01:59.950
You hear from Rayna's people

01:59.951 --> 02:01.405
about when we're starting the tour back up?

02:01.406 --> 02:02.587
Well, I've been trying to push them

02:02.588 --> 02:04.374
to see if she's up for it, but so far...

02:04.375 --> 02:05.832
Well, I don't know why she wouldn't be.

02:05.833 --> 02:08.023
She seems to be up enough to
plug her new label all over town.

02:08.024 --> 02:10.285
The fact that she didn't sing
at the stockholders showcase

02:10.286 --> 02:11.549
suggests to me that,
you know, there could...

02:11.550 --> 02:14.306
What? Her throat is still
sore from the intubation?

02:14.307 --> 02:16.731
That is what lip synching
is for. She'll heal.

02:16.732 --> 02:18.385
Look, Bucky said she's
not ready to decide yet.

02:18.386 --> 02:19.489
I don't know.

02:19.490 --> 02:20.922
But I'm afraid that if we push
'em too hard on this, that they...

02:20.923 --> 02:22.858
We cannot afford to push another date.

02:22.859 --> 02:25.014
She might not have a
new album out, but I do.

02:28.681 --> 02:30.331
Happy Birthday, mom.

02:30.910 --> 02:32.959
It's been quite a year.

02:34.133 --> 02:36.190
Maddie's having such a hard time right now,

02:36.191 --> 02:37.746
and...

02:38.934 --> 02:40.629
Gosh, I feel for her.

02:41.672 --> 02:43.274
She's pretty much the same age I was

02:43.275 --> 02:45.062
when I lost you and...

02:46.600 --> 02:50.406
I get it. I just... I don't
know how to talk to her about it.

02:56.658 --> 02:58.774
I think part of it is I'm not...

03:00.792 --> 03:03.626
Quite sure who I am right now or something.

03:07.381 --> 03:09.950
'Cause I think I've lost my voice.

03:14.188 --> 03:15.998
I don't know who I am without it.

03:23.454 --> 03:24.812
Anyway...

03:26.951 --> 03:28.354
I miss you, mom.

03:30.103 --> 03:31.562
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, no problem.

03:32.531 --> 03:34.424
<i>You okay in there, honey?</i>

03:34.425 --> 03:35.845
Yeah, just...

03:35.846 --> 03:39.243
Still dealing with that
first trimester queasiness.

03:39.710 --> 03:41.839
<i>Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

03:42.906 --> 03:45.180
<i>Of course, I'd be happy to meet with...</i>

03:47.732 --> 03:49.748
That'll be great. I look
forward to hearing from you.

03:49.749 --> 03:51.308
Bye.

03:51.309 --> 03:52.984
Who are you talking to?

03:52.985 --> 03:55.569
I was talking to the head of the
congressional exploratory committee.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.936
Rob Jenson's looking to retire next year,

03:57.937 --> 04:00.930
and I... I figured I may
throw my hat in the ring.

04:00.931 --> 04:02.451
Would they support you for that?

04:02.452 --> 04:04.345
I know my start in the mayor's office

04:04.346 --> 04:07.050
was a bit bumpy, but
my poll numbers are up.

04:07.051 --> 04:08.607
I got the city back on track fiscally.

04:08.608 --> 04:11.632
- You come from a long line of senators.
- Yeah, that, too.

04:11.633 --> 04:13.745
Even though my father
trashed the Conrad name

04:13.746 --> 04:15.338
when he was in office...

04:16.240 --> 04:17.779
And now...

04:17.779 --> 04:20.315
I feel like I may be in
a position to get it back.

04:22.716 --> 04:24.541
This was my mother's.

04:26.188 --> 04:27.743
It's beautiful.

04:30.606 --> 04:32.738
Are you doing this to avoid a scandal,

04:32.739 --> 04:35.838
or are you... doing this so that we can

04:36.219 --> 04:38.018
be together as a family?

04:38.706 --> 04:41.264
Would it be wrong if I said both?

04:41.872 --> 04:43.783
Okay.

04:44.127 --> 04:46.195
Look, let's just keep this between us,

04:46.196 --> 04:47.471
just until I can tell the girls, okay?

04:49.416 --> 04:50.887
Mm.

04:50.888 --> 04:52.479
I love you.

04:53.506 --> 04:56.285
That's it, give me that lady-killer smile.

04:56.286 --> 04:58.639
There we go. Good. Nice.

04:58.995 --> 05:02.101
All right, and... perfect.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.237
Go change.

05:05.257 --> 05:05.769
How are we doing?

05:05.770 --> 05:07.092
I think we're getting
all the looks we need.

05:07.093 --> 05:07.942
Yeah?

05:07.943 --> 05:09.747
By the way, that song
you did at the showcase

05:09.748 --> 05:11.986
- is getting a ton of attention right now.
- Really?

05:11.987 --> 05:13.737
Jeff thinks it's a hit waiting to happen.

05:13.738 --> 05:14.818
He wants you to get into a studio

05:14.819 --> 05:16.616
and record it with a producer right away.

05:17.372 --> 05:18.892
That's great. That's great.

05:18.893 --> 05:20.920
Like I said, though, that's,
uh, the song my buddy wrote.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.481
So I just gotta get his okay, you know?

05:22.482 --> 05:23.822
Is that a problem?

05:23.823 --> 05:25.132
No, it shouldn't be.

05:25.133 --> 05:26.711
Then do it.

05:28.483 --> 05:31.112
Uh, how about if I run my
hand through my hair like this?

05:31.113 --> 05:32.571
Good, Layla. You're a natural.

05:32.572 --> 05:33.984
All right. Now I want you to look down

05:33.985 --> 05:36.243
and then look right
back up at me. That's it.

05:36.244 --> 05:38.288
Reminds me of a young Juliette Barnes.

05:38.289 --> 05:39.648
Why, thank you.

05:39.649 --> 05:41.281
Excellent. There we go.

05:41.282 --> 05:42.544
How about, um, this?

05:42.545 --> 05:44.215
Wonderful. Thank you so much.

05:44.216 --> 05:45.774
- Thank you.
- All right.

05:45.775 --> 05:48.084
Scarlett, how are ya?

05:48.439 --> 05:50.643
All right, now... Energy up. Here we go.

05:51.224 --> 05:53.790
Give me some sexy.

05:53.791 --> 05:54.926
You know what?

05:54.927 --> 05:56.410
We need to perk the twins up. Okay?

05:58.511 --> 06:00.069
Just show 'em off...

06:00.540 --> 06:02.324
All right. Here we go.

06:02.325 --> 06:03.621
Keep it loose. Keep it sexy.

06:03.622 --> 06:05.414
All right, now give me some pout.

06:05.791 --> 06:07.914
- What?
- You're hot, you're sensuous,

06:07.915 --> 06:10.136
you're... you're "come hither." All right?

06:10.137 --> 06:13.631
And, uh... Now turn to your left.

06:13.632 --> 06:16.048
There we go. Your... Your other left. Oh.

06:16.049 --> 06:18.175
Sorry. All right, face me.

06:19.475 --> 06:20.762
<i>* It's the new black *</i>

06:21.110 --> 06:24.374
You know, can you just
try to have fun with this?

06:25.178 --> 06:26.874
All right.

06:33.558 --> 06:34.772
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:34.773 --> 06:36.573
Come in. Nice to see you

06:36.574 --> 06:38.531
in something other than
your orange jumpsuit.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.800
Oh, yeah.

06:42.287 --> 06:43.961
What can I do for you?

06:43.962 --> 06:47.028
I wanted to apologize.
I was pretty rude to you,

06:47.029 --> 06:49.924
and I want to say thank
you for all you did,

06:49.925 --> 06:53.214
- despite my, uh...
- Need for punishment?

06:53.215 --> 06:54.470
Yeah.

06:54.910 --> 06:56.418
Working on that.

06:56.419 --> 06:58.322
Oh, and, um...

06:58.323 --> 07:00.352
I sent you this check,
but it got sent back.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.180
I just wanted to make sure you got it.

07:02.181 --> 07:04.045
Yeah, I don't accept payment for my, uh,

07:04.046 --> 07:05.962
- court-appointed cases.
- All right, well...

07:05.963 --> 07:07.257
I want you to give it to someone else,

07:07.258 --> 07:08.828
maybe someone who doesn't
have the means to...

07:08.829 --> 07:10.183
No. Ser-seriously, don't worry about it.

07:10.184 --> 07:11.422
I'm not worried. It's just, I mean,

07:11.777 --> 07:13.466
you know, you're this big, fancy lawyer,

07:13.467 --> 07:15.266
and you could have just written me off

07:15.267 --> 07:17.022
and had me plead guilty, but you didn't.

07:17.023 --> 07:17.921
You spent a lot of time,

07:17.922 --> 07:19.045
and I want to make sure
you get paid for what you...

07:19.046 --> 07:21.032
I'm fine.

07:21.268 --> 07:23.547
- Dinner.
- What?

07:23.885 --> 07:25.141
Buy me dinner.

07:25.945 --> 07:26.939
When?

07:26.940 --> 07:28.297
Tomorrow night.

07:28.298 --> 07:30.122
And... and then we can call it even.

07:30.123 --> 07:31.538
Oh, that makes us even?

07:31.539 --> 07:33.429
Well, it has to be a nice place.

07:33.430 --> 07:35.643
I mean, I'm a big, fancy lawyer.

07:39.857 --> 07:40.888
Okay.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.435
Hey.

07:46.795 --> 07:48.694
I appreciate you taking this on.

07:49.019 --> 07:50.590
It couldn't have been easy investigating

07:50.591 --> 07:54.116
a man as... influential as my father.

07:54.117 --> 07:56.033
Well, it took some digging, but...

07:56.896 --> 07:58.724
Original police report.

07:58.725 --> 08:00.285
In the moments prior to the crash,

08:00.644 --> 08:02.294
a witness claimed to have
seen your mother's car

08:02.295 --> 08:04.062
being followed by a Cadillac.

08:04.063 --> 08:07.089
Yes, my father had one, but he
was in Louisville that night.

08:07.090 --> 08:08.147
Sort of.

08:08.148 --> 08:11.170
He checked into a hotel there
four hours after she was killed.

08:11.171 --> 08:13.552
Now that's roughly a
3-hour drive from here.

08:13.553 --> 08:15.069
Well, that's not exactly proof.

08:15.070 --> 08:17.290
To place him at the
scene of the accident, no.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.178
But an interview given by
one of your housekeepers...

08:19.179 --> 08:20.929
Uh, a Mrs. Munson...

08:20.930 --> 08:23.168
Actually placed him in
Nashville that night.

08:23.517 --> 08:26.121
- Munson...
- Told police she heard your parents

08:26.122 --> 08:28.030
fighting that same night.

08:28.031 --> 08:29.995
Heard your mother say she was leaving him.

08:30.794 --> 08:32.501
Mrs. Munson later recanted.

08:32.875 --> 08:35.157
She died shortly thereafter.

08:35.990 --> 08:37.899
And so did the investigation.

08:40.057 --> 08:42.501
Did the police ever question my father?

08:42.809 --> 08:44.704
Lamar Wyatt was never the sort of man

08:44.705 --> 08:47.706
- to be questioned.
- Okay.

08:47.707 --> 08:50.655
I guess I was hoping that the
U.S. attorney was bluffing.

08:52.361 --> 08:53.658
I'm sorry.

08:54.211 --> 08:55.595
Thanks.

09:02.223 --> 09:05.281
Hey. Oh, sorry. Is it too late?

09:05.282 --> 09:06.837
- No.
- I really need to talk to you.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.325
Well, you could have
saved yourself the trip

09:08.326 --> 09:10.088
and returned my calls.

09:10.426 --> 09:12.021
Well, it wasn't really something I wanted

09:12.022 --> 09:13.450
to talk to you about over the phone.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.379
Fine.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.557
You can close the first concert.

09:16.558 --> 09:18.610
God knows everybody's coming
to see you perform anyway.

09:18.611 --> 09:21.591
No, Juliette, I gotta cancel the tour.

09:21.592 --> 09:23.311
- What?
- With everything that's happened,

09:23.312 --> 09:26.411
I just... I've got to stay
at home for a little while.

09:26.735 --> 09:28.626
Uh, the insurance will
cover it. We'll be...

09:28.627 --> 09:30.767
The insurance company is
not gonna help me chart.

09:30.768 --> 09:32.520
I'm sorry. It's just the
situation that I'm in. I...

09:32.521 --> 09:34.966
Rayna, I do not have
a near-death experience

09:34.967 --> 09:36.790
to help me boost my record sales.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.174
I need this.

09:38.175 --> 09:39.829
Well, I need to be at home with my family.

09:40.172 --> 09:42.600
I mean, you're a smart
girl. You'll figure it out.

09:42.601 --> 09:44.427
You have got to be kidding me!

09:44.428 --> 09:46.901
This is... this sucks!

- That was so beautiful.
-  Thank you.

10:37.994 --> 10:39.710
- Is it for Sunday?
- Yes.

10:40.134 --> 10:42.323
It's lovely. It reminds me of being

10:42.324 --> 10:44.289
back in your daddy's church.

10:44.290 --> 10:45.327
Trying not to giggle

10:45.328 --> 10:47.467
so he wouldn't give us the
stink eye from the pulpit.

10:47.468 --> 10:49.588
- I don't miss that.
- Yeah.

10:49.589 --> 10:51.548
Oh, I do miss singing with you, though...

10:51.549 --> 10:52.885
And home.

10:53.210 --> 10:55.085
I didn't realize how easy it was,

10:55.440 --> 10:56.763
and now it seems like work.

10:56.764 --> 10:59.579
You sing for a living now. It is work.

10:59.580 --> 11:00.725
You're lucky to have it.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.844
Oh, it sounds awful.
I'm so grateful for it.

11:02.845 --> 11:04.345
I am. Just...

11:05.213 --> 11:06.548
Some of the things they're making me do

11:06.549 --> 11:07.618
are really weird.

11:07.619 --> 11:09.767
The photo shoot? How'd it go?

11:09.768 --> 11:12.649
I don't mind having my
picture made or anything,

11:12.650 --> 11:14.217
but when they're pulling you around

11:14.218 --> 11:15.773
and poking you, and...

11:15.774 --> 11:17.567
I just feel like I let Rayna down.

11:17.568 --> 11:19.602
They're saying, "have fun," and I can't.

11:19.603 --> 11:22.542
If you're not having fun, then
you're doing something wrong.

11:22.952 --> 11:24.888
We need to fix that.

11:24.889 --> 11:26.444
I was hoping you'd say that.

11:31.406 --> 11:33.660
You've been making yourself
pretty scarce at the house.

11:33.661 --> 11:36.563
Could I just talk to you for a minute?

11:37.025 --> 11:38.732
Don't know why you asked.
Seems you pretty much

11:38.733 --> 11:40.258
do whatever the hell you want.

11:40.259 --> 11:42.033
All right. I deserve that.

11:42.485 --> 11:43.457
But listen, man...

11:43.458 --> 11:45.846
Look, if you hadn't noticed,
I'm workin' right now, Will.

11:45.847 --> 11:48.344
I get it. I shouldn't
have performed your song

11:48.345 --> 11:49.902
without your permission. I'm sorry.

11:50.414 --> 11:52.227
But the folks at Edgehill love it.

11:52.228 --> 11:53.537
That's nice.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.578
<i>No, man, they really love it.</i>

11:55.579 --> 11:56.788
<i>They want me to cut it.</i>

11:56.789 --> 11:58.146
Make it my first single.

11:58.501 --> 11:59.712
Think about it, man...

11:59.713 --> 12:02.126
A single on the radio. This could be huge.

12:03.271 --> 12:05.941
- Yeah, it could be for you.
- Oh, for you, too, man.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.200
- I mean, if this is a huge hit...
- That's a big "if".

12:08.201 --> 12:09.645
And you're the guy who wrote it...

12:10.691 --> 12:12.293
That's money.

12:12.658 --> 12:14.108
And there's more of it down the line

12:14.109 --> 12:15.718
- when other artists...
- Artists, right.

12:15.719 --> 12:17.185
Performers... whatever
you want to call 'em...

12:17.186 --> 12:19.107
They're gonna be knockin'
down your door for more music.

12:19.108 --> 12:21.210
<i>* There for you *</i>

12:21.211 --> 12:22.905
Come on, man. You're a songwriter.

12:22.906 --> 12:24.600
Aren't you supposed to
make money off your songs?

12:25.460 --> 12:27.890
Fine. Fine. I'll think about it.

12:28.811 --> 12:30.204
- All right?
- All right.

12:30.205 --> 12:32.286
Now get outta here and let me do my job.

12:35.718 --> 12:37.174
Hey, what are you doing here?

12:37.175 --> 12:38.552
I'm the new barback.

12:39.439 --> 12:41.566
Great.

12:41.567 --> 12:44.023
Now it sucks to be at home,
and it sucks to be at work, too.

12:55.186 --> 12:57.530
Wow, this is beautiful, isn't it, girls?

12:57.894 --> 12:59.645
This dress is incredibly itchy.

13:00.329 --> 13:02.276
I should have just picked a different one.

13:02.277 --> 13:04.947
Well, honey, you look
beautiful and very grown up.

13:08.151 --> 13:10.234
Are there only old people here?

13:10.235 --> 13:11.859
- Charming.
- Charming.

13:11.860 --> 13:13.461
- Excuse me a
bit. - Pa-paw!

13:13.462 --> 13:15.510
There they are!  Oh!

13:15.511 --> 13:17.358
Hello, beautiful.

13:17.359 --> 13:18.415
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

13:18.416 --> 13:20.031
Daddy, you've outdone
yourself. Looks amazing.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.988
Well, thank you, darling.
Thank you so much.

13:21.989 --> 13:23.568
I'm starting to think you love
the symphony more than mom did.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.271
Don't be silly. You know we both loved it.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.919
Now I gotta work the
room for a little while.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.448
- There's our table.
- All right.

13:29.449 --> 13:31.077
I'll be right back, all right?

13:31.078 --> 13:33.684
What do you think so far?
Oh, you wanna try caviar?

13:33.685 --> 13:35.291
That looks so gross.

13:35.292 --> 13:36.844
Uh, that's a no, thank you.

13:36.845 --> 13:38.338
Look, candy!

13:40.474 --> 13:42.201
I think it's gonna be a long night.

13:42.202 --> 13:45.453
She'll be grateful to you
one day in about ten years.

13:45.454 --> 13:47.341
- Oh, you think?
- Oh, thank you.

13:48.918 --> 13:50.910
Did you know he was coming?

13:50.911 --> 13:52.670
I mean, I know that the mayor's usually

13:52.671 --> 13:54.838
on the host committee, but still...

13:55.847 --> 13:57.259
It bothers me less that he's here

13:57.260 --> 13:58.789
than somebody else.

13:58.790 --> 14:00.609
This was my tour to begin with.

14:00.610 --> 14:03.091
Rayna only came on board
because Marshall forced us to.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.358
Marshall was just trying to fix

14:04.359 --> 14:06.658
the public relations nightmare
that your career had become.

14:06.659 --> 14:08.272
Okay, well, that is old news,

14:08.273 --> 14:09.900
and she can park it at home.

14:10.625 --> 14:12.860
This... Is what we're doing...

14:12.861 --> 14:15.348
A revised set list of all
the songs from my new album.

14:15.349 --> 14:17.272
Look, I mean, we can rebook
and repackage the tour,

14:17.273 --> 14:19.181
but you're gonna need to
open up to your tween stuff.

14:19.182 --> 14:20.990
And you're gonna promote it like that, too.

14:20.991 --> 14:22.954
So I'll put a couple of
old hits in the middle,

14:22.955 --> 14:24.371
and I'll do one for the encore.

14:24.372 --> 14:26.852
And I want this entire set changed.

14:26.853 --> 14:29.165
<i>It needs to be more
artistic, less of the fluff.</i>

14:29.166 --> 14:30.415
But your old fan base...

14:30.416 --> 14:31.793
You know, the one that's evaporating...

14:31.794 --> 14:33.717
They want sparkle and flash.

14:33.718 --> 14:35.884
Good. I just won a CMA.

14:35.885 --> 14:38.485
I know, but this plan...
It only works for theaters

14:38.486 --> 14:40.726
and smaller secondary markets, not arenas.

14:40.727 --> 14:42.904
Okay, I only play arenas. You know that.

14:42.905 --> 14:44.538
Honey...

14:44.539 --> 14:46.423
You got no chance of selling out arenas

14:46.822 --> 14:48.742
if you don't start to
cater to the young fans

14:48.743 --> 14:50.703
that got you there in the first place.

14:53.201 --> 14:56.285
Fine. If that's the only way, then...

14:56.286 --> 14:59.332
How soon can we get the
old material up and runnin'?

15:00.192 --> 15:01.510
I just want to thank all y'all

15:01.511 --> 15:04.871
for coming and making this
event a tremendous success.

15:05.186 --> 15:07.708
I started coming to the symphony

15:07.709 --> 15:11.613
because my wife loved music of all kinds.

15:11.614 --> 15:14.682
We listened to more sonatas
here than I could count.

15:14.683 --> 15:16.532
For all those wonderful memories,

15:16.533 --> 15:20.359
I am grateful, so it's
in her honor that I pledge

15:20.360 --> 15:22.015
my family's continued support

15:22.016 --> 15:25.163
of this magnificent institution.

15:25.839 --> 15:27.838
To Virginia Wyatt.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.159
I love you, darling, and I miss you.

15:42.364 --> 15:43.751
How's your hand?

15:43.752 --> 15:44.949
It's fine.

15:45.392 --> 15:47.392
They gave me some pills for the pain,

15:47.393 --> 15:50.164
but they clearly don't help
with my meat-cutting skills.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.135
Or your guitar playing, I imagine.

15:53.136 --> 15:55.332
I only got myself to blame for that.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.381
Are you sure you were provided

15:56.382 --> 15:58.937
with adequate medical care
while you were in custody?

15:58.938 --> 16:00.182
What are you talkin' about?

16:00.183 --> 16:01.864
If your bail amount was any indication,

16:01.865 --> 16:03.603
you were being targeted unfairly.

16:03.938 --> 16:05.967
I'm guessing the mayor is not a fan.

16:05.968 --> 16:08.280
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter now.

16:08.281 --> 16:09.773
It's all ancient history.

16:09.774 --> 16:11.845
And yet you still can't cut a steak?

16:11.846 --> 16:13.514
I don't know. I think
you might have grounds

16:13.515 --> 16:15.292
for a civil suit against the city.

16:15.293 --> 16:16.931
I'm not the litigious type.

16:17.956 --> 16:19.452
So I don't see that happening.

16:19.453 --> 16:22.141
Innocent, but wants to stay in jail.

16:22.142 --> 16:24.332
Suffers a possible career-ending injury,

16:24.978 --> 16:26.635
but won't sue. I don't...

16:26.636 --> 16:28.519
I-I can't say I've ever come
across anyone like you...

16:28.520 --> 16:30.449
Yeah, well, right back at you.

16:30.450 --> 16:31.700
Okay, 'cause for the life of me

16:31.701 --> 16:34.599
I can't understand why this successful,

16:34.600 --> 16:36.220
beautiful, high-end attorney

16:37.600 --> 16:39.674
would defend somebody the likes of me.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.678
- Seriously, why?
- Long story.

16:43.679 --> 16:46.368
Well, uh, the steak's
not going anywhere fast.

16:46.369 --> 16:49.124
So, uh... let's hear it.

16:52.259 --> 16:54.862
- Oh, Rayna.
- Hey. Picture.

16:56.171 --> 16:57.085
Let's get a family picture

16:57.086 --> 16:59.192
- in front of your mother's portrait, okay?
- Okay.

16:59.193 --> 17:01.031
- Tandy, Daphne... Come on. Come here.
- Maddie?

17:01.032 --> 17:02.956
Can you come join us?
We're gonna take a picture.

17:02.957 --> 17:03.962
No, thanks.

17:03.963 --> 17:06.330
- Would you, please?
- Why?

17:06.332 --> 17:09.041
Because we've got the
whole family together.

17:09.042 --> 17:09.951
Not really.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.270
Okay, a little closer together.

17:14.271 --> 17:15.994
One big happy family.

17:16.465 --> 17:18.690
Smile.

17:18.691 --> 17:20.291
I'm gonna go find dad.

17:20.646 --> 17:23.598
<i>- Hey, sweetheart? Maddie?
- What?</i>

17:24.141 --> 17:26.464
Can you just try to stick
with this a little bit longer?

17:26.465 --> 17:28.023
I know you're not having a good time.

17:28.025 --> 17:30.027
- But we are gonna say
our good-byes... - When?

17:30.028 --> 17:32.598
- Soon.
- This party is not fun.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.698
And I do not feel like a princess.

17:34.699 --> 17:36.938
Nothing's ever the way
you say it's gonna be.

17:36.939 --> 17:38.742
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, dad.

17:39.150 --> 17:40.945
You okay?

17:40.946 --> 17:44.553
<i>- I am now that you're here.
- We're having a teenage moment.</i>

17:44.960 --> 17:46.596
Hi.

17:46.597 --> 17:48.875
- Hey.
- Maddie, you look adorable.

17:49.363 --> 17:50.297
Thanks.

17:50.298 --> 17:51.767
Surprised to see you here this year, Peggy.

17:51.768 --> 17:54.996
<i>Well, the real surprise is
how well you've recovered.</i>

17:55.648 --> 17:58.815
Your mother is a true survivor.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.576
That's not yours.

18:00.577 --> 18:02.619
Why are you wearing my grandmother's ring?

18:05.691 --> 18:07.284
Dad?

18:12.882 --> 18:15.700
You're marrying her?! I thought
you didn't even like her anymore.

18:15.701 --> 18:16.937
Just lower your voice, sweetheart.

18:16.938 --> 18:19.164
- Don't call me that.
- Maddie, settle down.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.206
Don't tell her to settle
down. This is very upsetting.

18:21.207 --> 18:22.826
- Just let me explain.
- I don't care.

18:22.827 --> 18:24.832
I hate this. I hate both of you!

18:24.833 --> 18:26.069
Honey, look, I know you're upset,

18:26.070 --> 18:27.806
but just... you don't need
to talk to us that way.

18:28.271 --> 18:29.990
Fine! I won't talk to you at all then.

18:29.991 --> 18:31.996
- Maddie, it's not... come on.
- This is a family event.

18:31.997 --> 18:33.593
Did you not think that maybe
your children might be here?

18:33.594 --> 18:35.257
Rayna, it was a mistake.

18:35.258 --> 18:36.787
And I didn't know the
girls were coming tonight.

18:36.788 --> 18:37.949
Well, you knew Peggy was coming.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.323
By herself. She's on some committee.

18:39.324 --> 18:40.416
Oh, so she's part of a committee,

18:40.417 --> 18:42.746
so you're not here
together, but you're engaged.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.290
You've just traumatized your daughter.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.983
Peggy is pregnant, okay?

18:46.984 --> 18:48.868
And I'm just trying to do right by her.

18:49.355 --> 18:51.073
Unbelievable.

18:55.539 --> 18:56.785
We dated all through law school,

18:56.786 --> 18:58.495
but we had only been married two years

18:58.496 --> 19:00.569
when, uh, he was killed.

19:00.977 --> 19:03.108
I'm sorry. I don't even...

19:03.109 --> 19:05.827
Yeah. I can't wrap my head
around that kind of loss.

19:05.828 --> 19:07.956
The kid who shot him was 17.

19:07.957 --> 19:09.862
Tried as an adult and sentenced to life.

19:09.863 --> 19:12.116
I visit him periodically.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.410
<i>You visit him?</i>

19:14.411 --> 19:15.620
Mm-hmm.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.309
Uh, I don't know anybody
that can sit across...

19:17.310 --> 19:18.547
I know trust me, I...

19:18.548 --> 19:20.608
Hated him at first.

19:20.609 --> 19:22.524
I mean, I-I wanted him dead.

19:22.874 --> 19:25.675
But, you know, after years of that,

19:25.676 --> 19:30.117
I just... Had to accept that...

19:30.979 --> 19:33.210
John wasn't coming back.

19:33.698 --> 19:36.526
The hate, um, didn't change anything.

19:36.527 --> 19:38.274
So...

19:38.275 --> 19:42.594
To... stop hating him, I had to know him,

19:43.614 --> 19:45.722
to forgive him.

19:46.054 --> 19:47.985
- Wow.
- Yeah anyway,

19:47.986 --> 19:50.059
eventually, it led to my taking

19:50.060 --> 19:52.314
these court-appointed cases when I can.

19:53.839 --> 19:58.414
Okay, so you're, like, the
world's best person ever.

19:58.415 --> 20:01.372
- Trust me, I have my shortcomings.
- Yeah, well,

20:01.373 --> 20:03.577
I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.

20:03.578 --> 20:05.733
Oh, wait, you've seen most of mine.

20:09.732 --> 20:10.985
Shall we get the check?

20:11.560 --> 20:14.059
Does that mean the night has to be over?

20:17.456 --> 20:19.029
Do you remember sneaking out

20:19.030 --> 20:20.344
'cause that Ricky Donet kid

20:20.345 --> 20:21.884
had a little boat he wanted to show us?

20:21.885 --> 20:26.290
And he tried to kiss you,
and you completely freaked out

20:26.291 --> 20:27.791
and ran down the street.

20:27.792 --> 20:31.053
And then after high
school, I slept with him.

20:32.591 --> 20:34.327
You slept with Sticky Ricky?

20:34.328 --> 20:36.335
You know, we hooked up a couple of times.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.176
And then there was Tim Lewis,
but that was just one night,

20:39.177 --> 20:40.694
- and then...
- No, no, wait. Hang on.

20:40.695 --> 20:41.913
You didn't tell me any of this stuff.

20:41.914 --> 20:43.003
Why'd you keep it a secret?

20:43.004 --> 20:45.935
Yeah, I think I just thought
that you had this image of me,

20:45.936 --> 20:48.816
you know, the preacher's
daughter, the good girl.

20:48.817 --> 20:50.992
But I stopped being her a long time ago,

20:51.343 --> 20:54.131
because, honestly, it
got to be really boring.

20:54.752 --> 20:57.803
You know, I can only hang
out and watch movies so much.

20:58.297 --> 20:59.528
I thought you'd like it.

20:59.529 --> 21:01.024
It's like old times, I know.

21:01.025 --> 21:04.700
But they weren't as
much fun as you remember.

21:04.701 --> 21:06.294
Let's go.

21:06.990 --> 21:08.892
- Where we goin'?
- We're going out.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.238
To make some new old times.

21:10.818 --> 21:13.529
Thank you for coming tonight.

21:16.253 --> 21:18.557
- Nice speech, daddy.
- Oh.

21:18.558 --> 21:20.805
Mwah. I had a lot of practice with it.

21:21.305 --> 21:22.864
I know.

21:22.865 --> 21:26.011
It's hard to believe she's
been gone for 30 years.

21:26.012 --> 21:28.048
Yeah. Seems like yesterday.

21:28.660 --> 21:31.059
Yeah. To me, too.

21:31.620 --> 21:34.137
In fact, I can remember exactly where I was

21:34.138 --> 21:36.080
when I found out she died.

21:36.392 --> 21:38.195
Rayna and I were in summer camp,

21:38.196 --> 21:40.442
and we were playing cards in our cabin,

21:40.443 --> 21:42.275
and the counselor came in, and...

21:44.505 --> 21:45.804
And I tried to call you,

21:45.805 --> 21:48.020
but you were away on business. You were...

21:48.021 --> 21:50.355
Where were you? You were in... Louisville?

21:50.973 --> 21:52.569
Yeah, that's right.

21:52.570 --> 21:55.682
I know I've never asked you this before.

21:56.724 --> 22:00.147
Do you remember mom's last words to you?

22:00.759 --> 22:02.769
It's probably something
like "pass the salt".

22:02.770 --> 22:06.286
We had... we had breakfast
together that day.

22:06.713 --> 22:08.520
Let's just... Let's just remember

22:09.244 --> 22:12.055
your mother's life tonight,
shall we? Not her death.

22:12.056 --> 22:13.461
Yes.

22:13.855 --> 22:15.298
Hey, Phil.

22:16.089 --> 22:19.537
Thank you for coming. Thank you for...

22:19.538 --> 22:21.614
All right, let's get this over with.

22:21.615 --> 22:22.946
Let's start from where we left off.

Everything okay?

23:02.324 --> 23:04.528
No. No, it is not okay.

23:04.529 --> 23:05.918
I thought that I could go back to this,

23:05.919 --> 23:07.411
but I can't, not to this.

23:07.412 --> 23:09.391
Everything about this feels wrong.

23:09.392 --> 23:11.822
- Guys, guys, take five, please.
-  Okay.

23:11.823 --> 23:13.091
What is it? What are you saying?

23:13.092 --> 23:15.150
I'm saying that I don't want to do

23:15.151 --> 23:17.962
these overproduced numbers.

23:18.412 --> 23:20.116
I've moved past this.

23:20.117 --> 23:21.506
You're 24 years old.

23:21.507 --> 23:24.168
Yes, I am 24 years old. I am not a tween.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.852
I have never been tween,

23:25.853 --> 23:27.394
not the way that I was raised.

23:27.395 --> 23:30.706
I can't keep putting
myself out there like this.

23:31.154 --> 23:33.090
This is my chance to move forward,

23:33.902 --> 23:35.398
and that's what I'm gonna do.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.921
Well, then you'd better
get used to cut-downs.

23:37.922 --> 23:39.764
I'm not playing to half an arena,

23:39.765 --> 23:41.904
and I'm not getting used to anything.

23:41.905 --> 23:44.073
Figure something else out.

23:54.329 --> 23:56.154
- Hey.
- I have to tell you something.

23:56.155 --> 23:58.351
I have to tell you something,
too. Have you seen the girls?

23:58.352 --> 23:59.707
No.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.995
Shoot. All right. Let's go find them,

24:01.996 --> 24:03.608
- get the hell out of here.
- I'm right with you.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.348
- Hey, sweet girl.
-  Maddie's gone.

24:06.349 --> 24:08.260
- She ran away.
- What?

24:14.464 --> 24:15.852
All right, thank you.

24:15.853 --> 24:17.332
She hasn't reached out
to any of her friends.

24:17.333 --> 24:19.612
- Is she home?
- Tandy's at the house with Daphne.

24:19.613 --> 24:21.225
There's no sign of Maddie there either.

24:21.226 --> 24:23.697
She's a 13-year-old
girl in an evening dress.

24:23.698 --> 24:25.219
How is it that no one's seen her yet?

24:25.220 --> 24:26.207
We've searched the entire building

24:26.208 --> 24:27.238
and the surrounding blocks.

24:27.239 --> 24:28.317
You are the damned mayor.

24:28.318 --> 24:30.313
You make sure that every
available unit is on this.

24:30.314 --> 24:31.562
Don't you think I've already done that?

24:31.563 --> 24:32.439
What about her cell phone?

24:32.440 --> 24:33.608
Is there a way we can track that?

24:33.609 --> 24:34.795
Rayna, it keeps going to voice-mail.

24:34.796 --> 24:35.850
If her phone's powered down,

24:35.851 --> 24:37.312
it makes it more difficult to pinpoint.

24:37.313 --> 24:38.739
- It'll take some time.
- Just find her.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.051
- Yes, sir.
-  Thank you.

24:40.052 --> 24:42.007
You know, all of this is
because of you and her.

24:42.008 --> 24:43.481
Is there anything I can do to help?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.151
Yeah, you could stay out of this.

24:45.152 --> 24:47.424
- This is a family concern.
- Which she is a part of.

24:47.425 --> 24:49.384
<i>I'll tell you what she is a part of.</i>

24:49.385 --> 24:50.953
She's part of breaking
that little girl's heart.

24:50.954 --> 24:53.424
You know what, y'all? I don't really
care whose fault it is at this point.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.330
My little girl's gone.
I'm gonna go find her.

24:57.472 --> 24:59.332
No, that sounds great.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.943
No, thank you.

25:00.944 --> 25:02.399
Oh, my God.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.582
Give me some good news.

25:03.583 --> 25:05.835
Edgehill just signed an even bigger name

25:05.836 --> 25:09.871
than Rayna Jaymes... Luke Wheeler.

25:09.872 --> 25:11.143
And he's about to launch a tour.

25:11.144 --> 25:13.044
<i>Hell... yes!</i>

25:13.365 --> 25:16.755
Get him on the phone. I will
totally co-headline with him.

25:16.756 --> 25:19.437
Luke's the biggest act in
country music right now.

25:19.438 --> 25:21.083
He doesn't co-headline.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.461
You want me to open?

25:22.462 --> 25:24.793
It's a plum gig. You can do a shorter set.

25:24.794 --> 25:26.797
You can still present
the new you. It's perfect.

25:26.798 --> 25:28.674
- No. - Then we're
back to cut-downs,

25:28.675 --> 25:30.355
or... or just canceling
this tour altogether

25:30.356 --> 25:31.664
until your new show's ready.

25:31.665 --> 25:33.975
- No, no, and no!
- Juliette...

25:35.747 --> 25:37.987

If... if she shows up or you hear from her,

28:27.045 --> 28:28.470
- you let me know, okay?
- All right, you let me know if you...

28:28.471 --> 28:29.952
Thank you.

28:48.314 --> 28:49.547
Hey.

28:49.548 --> 28:51.437
I just kept walking and walking,

28:51.769 --> 28:53.588
and I didn't know where I was.

28:53.589 --> 28:55.076
It's okay.

28:55.077 --> 28:56.974
I got you.

28:58.235 --> 28:59.820
I got you.

29:07.938 --> 29:10.349
Here is to being all grown up.

29:11.649 --> 29:14.613
Ha! Is it just me, or is
that guy taking photos of us?

29:15.897 --> 29:18.581
- No, he's taking pictures of you.
- Why?

29:18.582 --> 29:20.438
I don't know. Maybe he recognizes you.

29:20.739 --> 29:21.725
Hang on a second.

29:23.942 --> 29:25.727
Excuse me. Would you mind not doing that?

29:25.728 --> 29:28.635
Sorry. Um, you're... Famous, though, right?

29:28.636 --> 29:29.525
No.

29:29.526 --> 29:30.682
Yeah. Yeah.

29:30.683 --> 29:32.336
I saw you perform at the Opry.

29:32.337 --> 29:33.528
You're amazing.

29:34.222 --> 29:36.471
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to take a picture...

29:36.472 --> 29:39.263
Thanks. Just, uh...
You could ask next time.

29:39.264 --> 29:41.540
Right. Of course. Excuse me. Um...

29:41.541 --> 29:44.397
Could... I ask you for your autograph?

29:44.398 --> 29:46.694
- Sure. Um...
- Thanks.

29:49.647 --> 29:51.155
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

29:52.162 --> 29:53.095
What the hell?

29:54.828 --> 29:58.782
<i>This... is to your very first autograph.</i>

29:58.783 --> 30:01.346
And not my last shot. Yay.

30:01.347 --> 30:02.851
Okay, folks, let's start out tonight...

30:02.852 --> 30:04.755
By welcoming to the stage...

30:04.756 --> 30:07.554
Zoey and Scarlett, singing
"Come See About Me."

30:07.555 --> 30:09.143
Please tell me you didn't.

30:09.144 --> 30:10.780
Well, somebody was harping on about how

30:10.781 --> 30:13.049
we're not in Natchez anymore,
so get your ass up here.

if you wanna change out of that dress...

31:05.684 --> 31:09.299
Thank you. I always loved that song.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.479
My friends are obsessed
with Layla grant's cover,

31:11.480 --> 31:13.925
but I still like yours better.

31:16.807 --> 31:19.052
You know, your mama must be worried sick.

31:19.053 --> 31:20.447
I can't deal with her right now.

31:21.964 --> 31:23.861
Can't deal with anyone
in my family, actually.

31:24.293 --> 31:26.022
I just wish I was older sometimes.

31:26.572 --> 31:29.258
Could just be on my own,
writing songs all day

31:29.259 --> 31:31.202
and playing the Bluebird at night.

31:31.203 --> 31:32.925
Nothing would matter but the music.

31:32.926 --> 31:35.485
That sounds like somebody else I know.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.396
Deacon? Yeah.

31:39.887 --> 31:42.209
I don't even know how to
talk to my mom about him.

31:42.864 --> 31:46.793
I feel like I wanna know more,
but only the truth, you know?

31:47.404 --> 31:49.865
But she doesn't really
care about my feelings.

31:49.866 --> 31:54.628
You know, your mama... cares
a lot about your feelings.

31:54.629 --> 31:56.630
I'm sure she'll talk to you about it.

31:57.202 --> 31:58.847
She quit the tour yesterday

31:59.359 --> 32:01.010
'cause she wants to be there for you.

32:01.741 --> 32:03.350
She told me herself that

32:03.857 --> 32:07.421
you girls mean more to her
than anything in this world...

32:07.722 --> 32:10.422
More than money, more than fans.

32:10.966 --> 32:14.257
More than me being really,
really pissed off at her.

32:15.391 --> 32:19.410
And right now I'll bet
she's just going crazy

32:19.411 --> 32:20.890
not knowing where you are,

32:20.891 --> 32:22.262
if you're okay.

32:23.541 --> 32:25.276
You're gonna call her, aren't you?

32:28.035 --> 32:29.431
Yes.

32:31.788 --> 32:33.617
How long have you known?

32:33.963 --> 32:35.979
That Maddie Conrad's your daughter.

32:38.284 --> 32:40.433
Hearing Rayna, watching you,

32:40.434 --> 32:41.891
the accident you two were in...

32:41.892 --> 32:43.490
It doesn't take much to connect the dots.

32:44.504 --> 32:48.790
All this upheaval in your life...
Is it because you found out?

32:50.196 --> 32:54.401
Everything I thought was
true suddenly...  Wasn't.

32:55.205 --> 32:56.396
You know?

32:56.397 --> 32:58.195
I didn't know which end was up, so...

33:00.140 --> 33:03.231
I did what I do and started drinkin'.

33:03.232 --> 33:04.848
I mean, I don't know, but...

33:05.225 --> 33:06.176
I don't know.

33:06.177 --> 33:07.959
I just keep waiting for
things to get back to normal.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.622
I spent a long time after
John died waiting for that.

33:11.371 --> 33:12.935
Yeah?

33:12.936 --> 33:15.629
I had to accept that

33:15.630 --> 33:19.276
I'm never gonna feel like the
old version of myself again.

33:19.277 --> 33:22.443
Kind of like a switch
was flipped or something.

33:27.026 --> 33:29.420
I don't know the first
thing about being a father.

33:30.491 --> 33:32.189
You'll figure it out.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.217
I picked her up at a gas station.

33:36.218 --> 33:38.576
She walked a couple
miles from Symphony Hall.

33:38.577 --> 33:40.646
Fell asleep about five minutes ago.

33:40.647 --> 33:42.627
- She just walked?
- Yes.

33:42.628 --> 33:44.595
She's all right.

33:47.047 --> 33:48.798
I've been beside myself.

33:50.212 --> 33:53.511
I guess you really do need
to be home with your family.

33:54.814 --> 33:56.413
Yeah.

33:56.714 --> 33:59.211
Well, I'm really sorry
to drag you into all this.

33:59.212 --> 34:00.889
No, I told her that she could call me

34:00.890 --> 34:02.656
if she ever needed to talk.

34:04.452 --> 34:06.587
I think the person that
she really wants to talk to

34:06.588 --> 34:08.416
is you, though...

34:08.417 --> 34:10.277
About her father...

34:11.091 --> 34:12.688
Deacon.

34:13.956 --> 34:16.184
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.858
This has all been real hard on her.

34:23.309 --> 34:27.146
None of this has been...
What I would have wanted or...

34:28.726 --> 34:30.206
What I would have planned.

34:30.208 --> 34:31.380
I guess at some point

34:31.382 --> 34:33.583
it's not about what you want anymore.

34:34.786 --> 34:37.101
You just gotta do what you gotta do.

34:38.255 --> 34:40.235
I am sorry about the tour.

34:40.237 --> 34:41.909
Me, too.

34:43.344 --> 34:45.002
But as you said...

34:45.820 --> 34:48.123
I'll figure something out.

34:49.089 --> 34:50.674
I always do.

34:53.973 --> 34:55.400
Hey, sweet girl.

34:58.123 --> 34:59.422
Maddie?

35:00.393 --> 35:01.719
Maddie?

35:09.404 --> 35:11.672
Deacon wrote "A Life That's Good"

35:12.413 --> 35:15.347
on a napkin at the Bluebird Cafe.

35:15.348 --> 35:18.103
I was singing at an open mic night,

35:18.104 --> 35:19.969
and he came in and he said

35:20.363 --> 35:23.689
he was inspired to write
it just by looking at me.

35:23.690 --> 35:25.961
Think I fell in love with
him in all of ten minutes.

35:25.962 --> 35:27.533
That's a great song.

35:27.534 --> 35:29.094
It's a great song.

35:33.963 --> 35:35.853
Honey, I-I...

35:36.355 --> 35:39.314
I really do want us to be able
to talk about all this stuff.

35:40.232 --> 35:41.776
And I know it's hard.

35:41.777 --> 35:43.737
It's a big change for both of us.

35:45.437 --> 35:47.027
But I'm your mama,

35:48.196 --> 35:50.530
and I'm here for you.

35:51.381 --> 35:53.049
And I really hope that you'll...

35:54.232 --> 35:56.983
Run toward me, not run away from me.

35:56.984 --> 35:59.370
Let's not push each other away over this.

36:02.473 --> 36:04.011
We're all we've got.

36:06.562 --> 36:08.070
I love you.

36:08.071 --> 36:09.510
I love you.

36:09.511 --> 36:11.821
Mom! I lost another tooth!

36:11.822 --> 36:13.842
- It's bleeding!
- I'm comin'!

36:13.843 --> 36:15.093
<i>Goodness gracious.</i>

36:33.098 --> 36:34.521
Hello?

36:36.370 --> 36:37.599
Deacon?

36:37.600 --> 36:39.125
- Hey.
- It's Maddie.

36:39.126 --> 36:40.930
Yeah, yeah, I know. Uh...

36:41.615 --> 36:42.684
I was just calling your mom,

36:43.149 --> 36:45.050
see, you know, how you were doing.

36:45.051 --> 36:47.196
I mean, she texted me
last night, but I just...

36:49.163 --> 36:50.669
Sounds like you're okay?

36:50.670 --> 36:53.065
I mean, I'm grounded, but other than that,

36:53.066 --> 36:54.290
I'm okay, I guess.

36:54.733 --> 36:55.949
Well, good.

36:55.950 --> 36:57.824
Good. That's real good. You know, uh,

36:59.861 --> 37:01.741
she was worried sick
about you. You know that?

37:01.742 --> 37:04.184
You know, a lot of people were worried.

37:04.185 --> 37:05.274
I know.

37:05.678 --> 37:06.775
You do me a favor?

37:07.907 --> 37:09.252
What?

37:10.609 --> 37:12.606
Don't run off like that again.

37:14.166 --> 37:15.552
Okay.

37:15.553 --> 37:17.353
Okay. Look, um..

37:18.431 --> 37:20.000
Be safe.

37:20.792 --> 37:22.183
Bye.

37:23.900 --> 37:25.842
Okay, bye.

37:27.510 --> 37:28.894
Dad.

37:30.311 --> 37:32.170
When you're a little girl,

37:32.171 --> 37:34.926
you think your parents can do no wrong.

37:36.726 --> 37:38.527
And then you grow up.

37:39.094 --> 37:41.096
And you see the flaws.

37:41.702 --> 37:43.626
You start to question.

37:45.810 --> 37:48.000
But only so much, because you wanna believe

37:48.001 --> 37:52.454
that deep down there's a good person there.

37:55.845 --> 37:57.541
Kickbacks...

37:57.542 --> 38:00.484
Payoffs, illegal contributions,

38:00.485 --> 38:02.156
it's all here.

38:02.157 --> 38:03.855
So what made you change your mind?

38:03.856 --> 38:06.016
He stole someone from our lives.

38:06.362 --> 38:10.602
He needs to be punished
in whatever way he can be.

38:19.561 --> 38:21.881
Hey.

38:22.631 --> 38:24.534
Hey, I got an idea

38:24.535 --> 38:27.302
how to amp up the way
I sing your first verse.

38:27.303 --> 38:29.481
I just wanna do your song justice.

38:29.482 --> 38:31.443
Yeah, me, too.

38:31.444 --> 38:33.165
Which is why my answer's no.

38:33.166 --> 38:35.649
I can't let you cut it, but you can have

38:35.650 --> 38:37.348
any other song of mine you want.

38:37.664 --> 38:39.361
Edgehill doesn't want another song.

38:39.362 --> 38:41.745
They want this one. This is the hit.

38:41.746 --> 38:43.948
Which is why I gotta keep it for myself.

38:44.370 --> 38:46.553
- And do what?
- Play it.

38:46.554 --> 38:48.460
Record it, release it myself if I have to.

38:48.967 --> 38:51.737
Look, I'm a songwriter,
but I'm a performer, too.

38:51.738 --> 38:53.496
I may never get half far as you have,

38:53.497 --> 38:54.997
but I'll be damned if I don't try.

38:54.998 --> 38:57.322
You're making a big mistake,
Gunnar, for both of us.

38:57.323 --> 38:59.686
Jeff's gonna have my
nuts in a vise all because

38:59.687 --> 39:03.546
you're too... shortsighted
to see the truth of things.

39:03.547 --> 39:07.411
Truth of things? The truth is, you
should have asked before you promised

39:07.412 --> 39:09.896
- something you couldn't deliver.
- No, no! You're jealous!

39:09.897 --> 39:11.860
- What?
- You're jealous of what I got.

39:11.861 --> 39:14.297
That's why you're holding
on to this damn song,

39:14.298 --> 39:16.555
and that's the damn truth.

39:19.884 --> 39:21.672
<i>I gotta tell ya,</i>

39:21.673 --> 39:23.452
I'm a little surprised you're doing this.

39:23.453 --> 39:25.546
Well, you made my options perfectly clear,

39:25.547 --> 39:26.631
and since they all suck,

39:26.632 --> 39:28.822
I may as well pick the one that
makes the most business sense.

39:30.958 --> 39:31.966
Layla.

39:31.967 --> 39:32.917
Thanks for stopping by.

39:32.918 --> 39:33.879
Oh, yeah, are you kidding?

39:33.880 --> 39:35.767
I mean, when Juliette Barnes
invites me to her house...

39:36.216 --> 39:37.912
Which is amazing, by the way.

39:37.913 --> 39:40.224
Wow. It's exactly how I pictured it.

39:40.225 --> 39:42.442
Oh, and I-I love your
car out front. It's...

39:42.443 --> 39:44.637
Thank you. I'm going to cut to the chase.

39:44.638 --> 39:47.165
Uh, Rayna is dropping out of
the "red lips, white lies" tour,

39:47.166 --> 39:50.042
so that means I'm gonna
need an opening act, and...

39:50.043 --> 39:52.217
Are you serious? Oh, my God. Wow.

39:52.218 --> 39:54.264
Um... Calm down. There's
no cameras rolling here,

39:54.265 --> 39:57.279
but, uh, I need someone to
appeal to my old fan base

39:57.280 --> 39:58.945
so I can move on with my new material,

39:58.946 --> 40:01.413
and since you are quite literally singing

40:01.414 --> 40:02.934
my old songs...

40:03.447 --> 40:05.382
I thought it would be a perfect fit.

40:05.383 --> 40:07.506
Wow. Um...

40:08.130 --> 40:10.484
I want you to know how
much this means to me.

40:11.263 --> 40:13.286
Cool. So thanks for coming by.

40:13.610 --> 40:15.019
That's it? Or...

40:15.020 --> 40:16.421
- That is it.
- Oh.

40:19.473 --> 40:21.161
You know, she reminds me of you

40:21.162 --> 40:22.691
when we first started working together.

40:23.607 --> 40:25.155
Watch your mouth.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.918
And would you send that car
back to Charlie Wentworth

40:26.919 --> 40:28.188
and let him know that Juliette Barnes

40:28.189 --> 40:29.813
can pay for her own cars?

40:35.160 --> 40:36.513
Why'd you run away?

40:37.182 --> 40:38.422
You're too young to understand.

40:38.781 --> 40:40.589
Why would you leave me?

40:40.590 --> 40:43.783
Look, dad's getting remarried.

40:43.784 --> 40:45.185
Probably starting a whole new family

40:45.186 --> 40:47.070
that I won't even be a part of.

40:47.071 --> 40:48.573
You're still my sister.

40:48.574 --> 40:50.052
Yes.

40:50.856 --> 40:52.430
I'm still your sister.

40:54.802 --> 40:56.456
I learned a new song.

40:57.381 --> 40:59.516
Probably sound better
if we sang it together.

41:01.433 --> 41:03.121
Is that the one you've been singin'?

41:03.122 --> 41:05.677
Yes. It's Deacon's, actually.
