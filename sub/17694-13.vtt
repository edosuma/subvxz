(bluesy music plays)

00:04.372 --> 00:05.504
What is your name?

00:05.506 --> 00:06.939
(normal voice) Stan.

00:06.941 --> 00:08.941
What did you say?
Uh...

00:08.943 --> 00:11.944
FRANCINE (seductive voice):
My name is Staniella.

00:11.946 --> 00:15.280
Okay.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.516
(normal voice)
<i> Where can I hide the bug?</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:19.718
<i> In the dresser?</i>
<i> No, this is a motel.</i>

00:19.720 --> 00:22.888
<i>  He'll leave right after we</i>
<i>have  full-on rubber-less sex.</i>

00:22.890 --> 00:24.623
<i> Got it.</i>

00:29.063 --> 00:31.230
(coughs) Did I just swallow one
of your teeth?

00:31.232 --> 00:33.399
FRANCINE:
Why am I recording all this?

00:33.401 --> 00:35.401
STAN:
'Cause I'm supposed to be

00:35.403 --> 00:37.236
a woman on this mission.
You're a spy?

00:37.238 --> 00:40.072
Now I feel like fool
for taking you to Jared's.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.206
(whack!)

00:44.645 --> 00:46.578
She disappeared.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.080
Like ghost.

00:48.082 --> 00:51.450
Another perfect
American spy operation.

(grunting rhythmically)

01:31.092 --> 01:32.524
What are you boys doing?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.860
We're going to the basement
to wrestle!

01:34.862 --> 01:36.361
But wrestling's dangerous.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.097
Not the way we do it,
mother.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.598
We never actually
get physical.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.767
It's all about
the pageantry.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.469
Hmm.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.671
Now you're just dangerously
close to me calling you a pussy.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.441
It's so quiet.
Where is everyone?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.876
Well, Stan's on a mission,

01:50.878 --> 01:52.878
so everyone's doing
whatever they want.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.713
Steve's wrestling
in the basement,

01:54.715 --> 01:57.249
and Hayley's finally getting
into it with DirecTV.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.917
(sighs)

01:58.919 --> 02:00.886
Listen, Randall, I know
this isn't<i> your</i> fault.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.721
You seem like
a-a really solid dude.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.656
So, you say
your husband's gone?

02:04.658 --> 02:05.991
Yeah.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.393
And you say
<i> my</i> husband's gone?

02:08.395 --> 02:09.595
I didn't...say that.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.662
Well, he is.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.398
Which makes us both...

02:13.400 --> 02:15.300
Widows!
Widows!

02:15.302 --> 02:17.302
I love the widow game!

02:17.304 --> 02:18.570
But you never love
catching on

02:18.572 --> 02:19.838
when I'm trying to get you
to play it.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.907
You know I don't.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.812
Just some steak for a tragically
young widow, please.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.147
Which kind
would you like?

02:28.149 --> 02:30.149
There are different kinds?

02:30.151 --> 02:33.252
My dead husband bought --
I'm sorry.

02:33.254 --> 02:37.022
My dead husband used
to buy our steaks.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.758
As I said, I'm a widow.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.527
Rib eye is the best.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.129
But does it also
cost the least?

02:44.131 --> 02:47.766
Since my husband died,
I've been so overwhelmed

02:47.768 --> 02:50.702
learning what
different things cost.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.771
For a widow,
it's on the house.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.773
I'm the same as her.
Just drop it in the sack.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.042
(bell jingles)

02:57.044 --> 02:58.510
Widows!
Widows!

02:58.512 --> 03:00.546
I can't let you test drive
a Lamborghini!

03:00.548 --> 03:02.347
You have no jobs,
no credit.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.016
(crying)
No husbands.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.450
(normal voice)
We're widows.

03:05.452 --> 03:08.620

04:01.609 --> 04:04.209
Actually,
hate to be this widow,

04:04.211 --> 04:05.944
but we just remembered

04:05.946 --> 04:09.047
our favorite restaurant
is in St. Louis.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.182
And we're widows.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.918
Widows!

I'll have a spicy Italian
with the works.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.358
Oh, and add avocado.

As we all know,
huge upcoming match

04:39.246 --> 04:42.147
at the Honda Center
in Anaheim, California.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.249
And the title
will be on the line.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.817
Sunday August 4th!

04:45.819 --> 04:47.653
Ooh, the pageantry!

04:47.655 --> 04:49.087
Speak of the devil!

04:49.089 --> 04:51.923
Here he is, the defending
champion himself --

04:51.925 --> 04:54.926
Steve "The Total Package" Smith

04:54.928 --> 04:57.796
and his manager,
Mr. Mastermind.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.298
Listen up!

04:59.300 --> 05:02.901
Sooner or later, that piper,
he comes a-calling!

05:02.903 --> 05:05.404
And when the Snot Rocket
and I

05:05.406 --> 05:08.340
are locked in that cage
on August 4th

05:08.342 --> 05:10.175
at the Honda Center,

05:10.177 --> 05:14.146
it's gonna be his time to face
the truth --

05:14.148 --> 05:16.848
the purest truth
there is...

05:16.850 --> 05:20.285
my championship belt.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.689
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.024
If you've got something
to say to me,

05:26.026 --> 05:27.793
you can say it
to my ugly face!

05:27.795 --> 05:29.294
Good Lord!

05:29.296 --> 05:32.764
It's the Snot Rocket
and Barrycuda The Blob.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.800
Nobody was expecting this.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.635
Total Package,

05:36.637 --> 05:40.038
there's only one thing
keeping you alive --

05:40.040 --> 05:42.341
that pretty face!

05:42.343 --> 05:44.343
And that belt!

05:44.345 --> 05:46.044
But I'm gonna take it
from you.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.012
Ow!

05:47.014 --> 05:48.180
I'm so sorry!

05:48.182 --> 05:49.681
You're not supposed
to hit.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.283
I know!
It was an accident.

05:51.285 --> 05:52.684
Are you okay?

05:52.686 --> 05:53.852
I guess so.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.687
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

05:55.689 --> 05:57.689
Save it for August 4th --

05:57.691 --> 06:00.225
at the Honda Center
in Anaheim!

06:00.227 --> 06:01.660
Wow!

06:01.662 --> 06:03.695
(siren wails)

06:07.134 --> 06:09.901
We made great time
from St. Louis.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.471
Lights and sirens, baby,
lights and sirens.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.672
BUNNY: Francine?

06:13.674 --> 06:15.741
Oh, crap.
Here comes a taco.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.677
It's me, Bunny.
Bunny Sanders.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.912
Bunny,
I didn't recognize you.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.214
You look so different.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.915
How are things?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.751
I'm a dancing taco,
Francine.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.053
Right, but wasn't that
always something

06:28.055 --> 06:29.388
you talked about being?

06:29.390 --> 06:30.889
No.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.824
I had to take this job
after my husband died.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.926
Widows!

06:34.928 --> 06:37.396
Sanders died?
How?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.231
On a mission.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.167
I just wish I'd been prepared
for life after John, you know?

06:42.169 --> 06:44.035
I had no idea!

06:44.037 --> 06:47.672
Every day is
a brutal struggle.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.942
(horn honks)

06:50.944 --> 06:53.412
Thank you!

06:58.552 --> 07:00.285
These are gross.

07:00.287 --> 07:03.088
Kind of glad they capped me
at 50.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.090
Oh, Stan, you're back!

07:05.092 --> 07:06.024
It was awful!

07:06.026 --> 07:07.292
I saw Bunny Sanders,

07:07.294 --> 07:09.261
and she was dressed
like a taco!

07:09.263 --> 07:11.630
Fashion is a playground,
Francine.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.432
Just because you lack the balls
to mix it up

07:13.434 --> 07:15.867
doesn't mean you have to knock
someone else for taking a risk.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.436
That's exactly right, Stan.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.704
No!
That's Bunny's job now.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.774
Why didn't you tell me Sanders
died on one of your missions?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.643
Because he<i> didn't</i> die
on a mission.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.745
He died on a body recovery
assignment --

07:26.747 --> 07:28.713
when we retrieve the bodies
of agents

07:28.715 --> 07:30.315
who<i> did</i> die on missions.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.983
We do it<i> all</i> the time.
It's like most of my job.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.418
(cellphone chimes)

07:33.420 --> 07:35.654
See? Body recovery.
Another dead agent.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.988
So you can stop worrying.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.890
Gotta run.
Enjoy that popcorn.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.828
Speaking of popcorn,
imagine if we were so poor

07:42.830 --> 07:45.130
we had to decorate
our Christmas tree with it.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.631
(popcorn popping)

07:51.839 --> 07:54.005
(gunfire)

07:54.007 --> 07:55.474
(grunts)

07:55.476 --> 07:58.910
(gunfire continues)

07:58.912 --> 08:00.479
(grunts)

08:02.149 --> 08:03.882
(grunt echoing)

08:05.085 --> 08:06.852
(screams)

08:06.854 --> 08:08.587
Francine,
give it a rest!

08:08.589 --> 08:10.856
You don't see me screaming
at my tacos.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.592
Wait a minute.
The tacos!

08:15.529 --> 08:18.597
(screaming)

08:18.599 --> 08:20.165
(screaming)

08:25.272 --> 08:26.338
It's a new widow day!

08:26.340 --> 08:27.939
Let's go down
to the graveyard

08:27.941 --> 08:29.708
and give 'em the old
"dig 'em up,

08:29.710 --> 08:31.743
I want to see his face
one last time."

08:33.447 --> 08:35.347
Ugh.
A support group.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.349
What's fun about this?
Nothing.

08:37.351 --> 08:40.018
Seeing Bunny yesterday
made me realize

08:40.020 --> 08:43.121
a widow's life isn't all Lambos
and rib eyes.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.891
Look, Fran, we're all badly
shaken by Sanders' death.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.493
I mean, I felt terrible
stealing Bunny's wallet

08:48.495 --> 08:50.829
through the leg hole
of the taco yesterday.

08:50.831 --> 08:51.897
But we don't need this.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.064
<i> I</i> do.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.467
What if Stan actually
gets killed?

08:55.469 --> 08:58.236
I need to hear what
this is really like,

08:58.238 --> 09:00.739
so I'm prepared
if it does happen.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.508
Death is natural.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.244
It's our reactions
that are unnatural.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.713
That's true,
but it's not funny.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.218
It's the quiet
that really gets me.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.487
I used to come downstairs
on a Sunday

09:15.489 --> 09:16.821
and hear the game on.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.890
Bob would be cursing
the Giants.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.393
Now when I come down
the stairs on Sunday,

09:21.395 --> 09:24.062
no game, no cursing.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.397
No Bob!

09:25.399 --> 09:27.065
No Stan.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.101
(sobbing)

09:30.103 --> 09:31.436
Why?!

09:31.438 --> 09:33.171
Nailed it!

09:33.173 --> 09:35.874
(crying)

09:35.876 --> 09:37.208
But I can beat it.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.944
Name's Roger.
I'm female.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.545
My second husband's name
was Eric,

09:40.547 --> 09:44.749
and as it turned out,
he died by my own hand.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.187
Did it just happen?

09:49.189 --> 09:51.756
You have to be
more specific.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.458
I have no idea
what you're t--

09:53.460 --> 09:56.094
oh, my husband's death,
yes!

09:56.096 --> 09:57.128
(somber voice) Yes.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.597
So fresh.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.266
The best thing you can do
for yourself now

10:01.268 --> 10:03.535
is to just keep getting out
of the house.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.136
Do you have a job?

10:05.138 --> 10:08.473
Some people say raising
their children is a job...

10:08.475 --> 10:10.609
But I haven't really
treated it that way.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.979
Francine, I'm a partner at
a Fortune 500 marketing agency,

10:13.981 --> 10:15.313
and I know for a fact

10:15.315 --> 10:17.983
that there's a position
available right now...

10:17.985 --> 10:20.151
At the diner
across from my office.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.886
And you!

10:21.888 --> 10:23.989
Do you have any
marketing experience?

10:23.991 --> 10:26.591
I beat a homicide rap
I confessed to many times.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.660
I think I can figure
out marketing.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.477
Roger?

10:45.479 --> 10:46.811
Where'd you get the car?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.079
The agency sent it.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.981
Probably as a show
of good faith.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.816
Contract negotiations
were...

10:51.818 --> 10:53.685
Not something
we engaged in.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.453
Wait, don't you want
to hear about me?

10:55.455 --> 10:58.957
(sighs)
Go ahead, say your words.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.026
I got the job
at that diner!

11:01.028 --> 11:02.761
What do you know!

11:02.763 --> 11:05.030
I know I said I needed to hear
what it would be like

11:05.032 --> 11:06.931
to be a real widow,
but I think I need...

11:06.933 --> 11:08.600
(air hisses)

11:08.602 --> 11:10.368
I need to live it.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.440
Stunning turn of events
tonight.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.710
Mr. Mastermind has defected
to the league of enforcers!

11:18.712 --> 11:22.280
I couldn't care less
about Mr. Master-fool

11:22.282 --> 11:25.283
and the League
of Dumb Forcers!

11:25.285 --> 11:27.886
(yelling)

11:27.888 --> 11:30.021
This is the only thing
that matters!

11:30.023 --> 11:32.190
Which is why
it's going to me...

11:32.192 --> 11:35.060
Brian
"The Home Invader" Lewis,

11:35.062 --> 11:39.230
A.K.A., The Basement Creep,
A.K.A., Midnight Lace!

11:39.232 --> 11:40.999
Principal Lewis, what are you
doing in our basement?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.667
I honestly have no clue.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.335
Last thing I remember,
I was climbing in that window.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.004
Anyway, the belt is mine!

11:46.006 --> 11:47.672
Ah! Careful.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.340
This isn't what
we're doing.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.909
Light touch,
light touch.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.977
Wrestling is all about
the pagean--

11:52.979 --> 11:54.579
Aah! Oh!

11:54.581 --> 11:56.748
(grunts)

11:56.750 --> 11:58.650
(screams)

12:00.887 --> 12:02.620
(slam!)

12:03.390 --> 12:04.589
Aah!

12:04.591 --> 12:06.391
No!

12:06.393 --> 12:07.559
(slam!)

12:07.561 --> 12:10.562
Oh, my God!
You're our principal!

12:10.564 --> 12:12.097
You think this is crazy,

12:12.099 --> 12:14.499
well, August 4th
is gonna be insane!

12:14.501 --> 12:16.601
That's the Honda Center,
August 4th.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.604
STEVE (strained voice): Klaus,
for God's sakes, get help.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.506
Be there!

12:23.543 --> 12:25.210
Francine, I'm back!

12:25.212 --> 12:26.511
We recovered...

12:26.513 --> 12:27.545
<i> Most</i> of the body.

12:27.547 --> 12:28.780
Franny's not here.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.515
Actually,
the whole family's busy.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.450
Sir, I can't express
this enough.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.786
You're never gonna win me
back with Encore.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.020
Hayley's doing that
and, oh,

12:36.022 --> 12:37.789
you know how when you leave
on a mission,

12:37.791 --> 12:39.924
Francine and I pretend
you're dead and play widows?

12:39.926 --> 12:41.593
Play widows?!
Yeah.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.428
And this time,
she<i> really</i> committed.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.131
She's, like, all bummed out
and working at a crappy diner.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.266
I swear, if I weren't
in a God damn bake-off

12:48.268 --> 12:51.136
with half of Madison Avenue to
land the new Dentine campaign,

12:51.138 --> 12:52.971
I would be
very concerned about her.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.440
Oh, on a side note,
what's the number one thing

12:55.442 --> 12:57.041
you look for
in an iced gum?

12:57.043 --> 12:58.476
Flavor sustainability.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.211
Now take me to that diner!

13:02.716 --> 13:04.149
Oh, my God!

13:04.151 --> 13:06.818
She's really acting like
I'm dead!

13:06.820 --> 13:09.487
Francine,
how did you end up here?

13:09.489 --> 13:12.056
Yecch, it was gross.
She took the bus.

13:16.329 --> 13:20.165
I go on a mission, risk my life,
and she plays widow?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.966
It's not playing,
it's more...

13:21.968 --> 13:24.335
It's too bad your psychologist,
Dr. Penguin,

13:24.337 --> 13:25.970
is on a book tour,

13:25.972 --> 13:28.006
'cause his new book touches
on this very subject.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.474
It's called
"coping a feel."

13:29.476 --> 13:30.842
Roger!

13:30.844 --> 13:32.844
Whoa, hey!
You have a dangerous job.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.479
When we were
fooling around,

13:34.481 --> 13:36.347
playing widows,
she was coping...

13:36.349 --> 13:37.582
A feel.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.284
A book now available
on Amazon.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.685
This is dumb.
I'm going in there!

13:40.687 --> 13:42.187
I-I wouldn't do that!

13:42.189 --> 13:44.923
She's fragile.
This calls for a gentle hand.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.258
Let me go in there,
do my thing.

13:52.699 --> 13:56.100
¶¶

14:17.457 --> 14:18.790
Well, is she coming home?

14:18.792 --> 14:20.358
Oh, shit, sorry.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.460
Totally forget about all
the stuff we talked about.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.295
But I did remember<i> you,</i>
Gerald.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.363
Meatballs!

14:26.466 --> 14:28.032
Gotta take care of my boy.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.737
Wow, Stan wasn't as impressed
as I thought he'd be

14:32.739 --> 14:34.572
when I gave away
those meatballs.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.241
You know what,
give 'em back.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.309
We'll try again when I have
Stan's full attention.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.410
Francine!

14:39.412 --> 14:41.212
(gasps)
Stan! You scared me.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.714
<i> I</i> scared<i> you?</i>

14:42.716 --> 14:44.582
You're scaring<i> me.</i>
What are you doing here?

14:44.584 --> 14:45.717
I'm working.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.585
Working?
You're acting crazy.

14:47.587 --> 14:48.820
This isn't crazy.

14:48.822 --> 14:50.822
Crazy is how I used
to act,

14:50.824 --> 14:53.324
pretending everything
was hunky-dory.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.726
Look, I don't want
to do this here.

14:54.728 --> 14:55.760
It's time to go home!

14:55.762 --> 14:57.729
No, let go!
I'm working!

14:57.731 --> 14:59.931
Hey, this guy
bothering you, Fran?

14:59.933 --> 15:02.800
No.
He was just leaving.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.605
Look, Francine,
maybe that guy's not perfect,

15:07.607 --> 15:10.375
but I got news for ya --
you're not getting any younger.

15:10.377 --> 15:14.112
And, oh, Ryan Gosling's never
walking through that door.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.780
So?

15:15.782 --> 15:17.382
I couldn't get
through to her.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.716
She's lost it.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.885
Come on, Stan.
Let's get out of here.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.687
I'm your wife now.

15:22.689 --> 15:23.855
No, Roger.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.298
I just don't get why
she's acting like this.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.767
Francine loves you,
but she worries about you.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.869
And that makes her worry
about herself.

15:37.871 --> 15:40.371
But when I'm on a mission,
it's<i> my</i> life on the line.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.040
And when your life's
on the line,

15:42.042 --> 15:43.641
her life's
on the line, too.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.743
Everything would change for her
if you were gone.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.812
Hmm. I never thought about it
that way.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.580
That's 'cause you're thick,
Stan.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.250
I'll go back in and tell her
I understand...

15:52.252 --> 15:53.251
If she'll listen.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.752
She won't.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.721
In the marketing world,
we have a term for this.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.922
You've burned that bridge.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.490
So what am I
supposed to do?

15:59.492 --> 16:01.759
Ugh! It's so hard having to do
all the thinking.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.995
You're lucking I'm a marketing
genius, currently.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.129
Take us to the office,
Gerald!

16:05.131 --> 16:06.798
Yes, sir.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.466
But then I'm gonna have
to close out your fare.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.635
Fare? Wait, the company
didn't send you.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.904
No, I'm an Uber driver you hired
a few days ago

16:12.906 --> 16:13.905
when you were drunk.

16:13.907 --> 16:14.973
Uber-X?

16:14.975 --> 16:16.307
Uber Black.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.176
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm ruined.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.311
ROGER:
¶ Roger, Roger ¶

16:20.313 --> 16:22.313
¶ Marketing, marketing ¶

16:22.315 --> 16:24.082
¶ Genius, genius ¶

16:24.084 --> 16:26.351
¶ Genius, genius ¶

16:26.353 --> 16:27.952
¶ Me ¶

16:27.954 --> 16:29.420
Roger, get to the point!

16:29.422 --> 16:30.788
If you want Francine,

16:30.790 --> 16:32.757
you're gonna have to change
your approach.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.526
Every marketing genius knows
that to reach the customer,

16:35.528 --> 16:38.196
you have to show them you
understand their problems.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.366
Show Francine I get
what she's going through.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.533
Bingo.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.202
Show, don't tell.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.005
And the best way to do that
is to make the consumer

16:47.007 --> 16:50.074
feel like you don't just
get them, you<i> are</i> them.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.014
So what do you say?
Did we land Dentine Ice?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.348
What?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.117
Sorry, I repurposed
the Dentine pitch.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.518
But you see
what I'm saying?

17:00.520 --> 17:03.454
Yeah. I do.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.689
Oh, one last thing.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.024
If you were an exec
at Dentine,

17:06.026 --> 17:07.725
would that pitch
have worked on you?

17:07.727 --> 17:10.228
Of course, I would have
replaced the word "Francine"

17:10.230 --> 17:12.063
with "Dentine Ice"
in most instances.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.065
Roger...

17:14.067 --> 17:15.566
I like it.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.235
I really do.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.737
It's just not us.
It's not Dentine.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.577
Stan,
I told you to get out!

17:26.579 --> 17:29.480
I'm sorry, you must be mistaking
me for someone else.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.083
I'm just a sad widower looking
for a hot meal.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.052
Oh, now you're
making fun of me?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.888
I don't know what you're
talking about, nice lady.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.824
Whatever.
Sit anywhere you like.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.761
So, need a minute
to decide?

17:43.763 --> 17:45.830
I'm thinking about
the Clams Casino.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.765
Are the clams fresh?
No.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.935
Ah, I don't know where it's okay
to order seafood.

17:50.937 --> 17:54.172
My wife always helps --
<i>used</i> to help me with that.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.274
What...happened to her?

17:56.276 --> 17:58.509
She died -- all the way.

17:58.511 --> 18:02.413
Why don't I fire up
those old clams.

18:06.786 --> 18:11.122
I was deeply, truly surprised
by principal Lewis

18:11.124 --> 18:13.024
coming out
from behind the boiler.

18:13.026 --> 18:16.360
This is bad.
But you know the worst part?

18:16.362 --> 18:18.596
The hospital food.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.699
Barry, my friend,
that well-placed taste of comedy

18:21.701 --> 18:24.635
is just the elixir these
battered bones needed.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.437
Well, your vitals
are looking good.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.939
Doctor,
what do you think?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.874
Oh, uh, yes,
I'll take it from here.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.378
Oh, no, Principal Lewis!

18:35.748 --> 18:37.915
Oh, no!
Midnight Lace!

18:37.917 --> 18:40.318
Splatter's up, boys!

18:40.320 --> 18:41.552
(grunting)

18:41.554 --> 18:46.157
(screaming)

18:46.159 --> 18:48.159
(growling)

18:48.161 --> 18:50.995
You want this belt back,
you can come and get it --

18:50.997 --> 18:53.231
August 4th
at the Honda Center!

18:53.233 --> 18:56.200
I don't think
I'm gonna go.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.638
So how did your wife die?
On the job.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.474
It was a very dangerous
line of work.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.177
She was an assassin,
but for space.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.012
A space assassin?

19:08.014 --> 19:09.514
Naturally.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.849
I know it was hard for her
to risk her life,

19:11.851 --> 19:13.618
but I don't think
she realized

19:13.620 --> 19:16.320
how hard it was for me every
time she blasted off.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.091
If something happened to her
up there, I...

19:20.093 --> 19:22.627
I didn't know if I could ever
put my life back together.

19:22.629 --> 19:26.130
Oh, Stan!
That's exactly how I feel!

19:26.132 --> 19:27.365
(door bell jingles)

19:27.367 --> 19:28.699
Why isn't everyone
cheering?

19:28.701 --> 19:31.035
Down on the ground,
both of you!

19:31.037 --> 19:32.537
Now is a bad time, guys.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.539
There are some pretty big
feelings going on here.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.507
Now empty your pockets!

19:36.509 --> 19:40.011
Francine,
do what the man says.

19:42.115 --> 19:43.848
(screams)

19:45.518 --> 19:47.018
Ow, ow, ow!

19:47.020 --> 19:49.453
Looks like
you're out of weapons.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.022
I don't need one.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.090
I had the clams.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.894
(horn blares)

19:56.896 --> 20:00.064
Francine,
I want you to come home.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.333
'Cause I always want
to come home to you.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.001
But when I'm on missions,

20:04.003 --> 20:06.971
if playing widow keeps you
from worrying about me...

20:06.973 --> 20:08.839
Then play your heart out.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.509
Honestly, Stan,
after seeing all that,

20:11.511 --> 20:14.078
I'm not so worried
about you anymore.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.647
You're, like,
really good.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.049
Mmm!

20:20.386 --> 20:21.919
Shall we?

20:21.921 --> 20:23.554
(sloshing)

20:26.059 --> 20:27.658
Let's get one thing
out of the way.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.894
The gum is terrible.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.262
Oh, sit down, David.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.931
Let's see where
she's going with this.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.100
You better know
what you're doing.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.436
(breathes deeply)

20:38.438 --> 20:42.840
Dentine Ice loves you,
but she worries about you.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.276
And that makes her worry
about herself.

20:45.278 --> 20:48.679
When your life's on the line,
her life's on the line, too.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.615
She, being Dentine Ice.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.118
Got 'em.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.386
So what do ya say?

20:55.388 --> 20:57.421
Did we land
Francine Ice?

20:57.423 --> 20:59.757
What?
What did I say?

20:59.759 --> 21:02.260
Did I just tell everyone
I'm an alien?

21:02.262 --> 21:04.262
Have a great night.
