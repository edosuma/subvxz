review my notes

31:09.824 --> 31:10.956

31:10.999 --> 31:14.263
that I always
get the facts right.

31:14.307 --> 31:17.484
Always.

31:17.527 --> 31:20.530

31:27.973 --> 31:29.322

31:29.365 --> 31:32.499

your existing inventory.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.814
- We did.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.555
- You're lying.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.950
- You slapped a new name
on the old trailers

31:48.994 --> 31:50.473
and you're selling them
through a company

31:50.517 --> 31:52.388
called CWG Building Systems.

31:52.432 --> 31:53.737
- That is not true.

31:53.781 --> 31:55.565

as here,

32:08.448 --> 32:10.058

32:10.102 --> 32:11.755
If you try and move
your stock again,

32:11.799 --> 32:13.670
we'll find it again.

32:13.714 --> 32:17.979

34:24.236 --> 34:26.890

34:34.724 --> 34:37.858

Kyle?

35:23.208 --> 35:24.165

35:24.209 --> 35:25.688
- He really came through.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.777
He got them to see her
after the surgery.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.476
It really meant a lot to them.

35:30.519 --> 35:34.393

35:41.922 --> 35:44.142

35:44.185 --> 35:45.404

35:47.362 --> 35:49.190

35:49.234 --> 35:51.061
Well, actually, I was--

35:51.105 --> 35:52.933

phone call today,

36:15.695 --> 36:17.871

36:17.914 --> 36:21.091
Apparently the dean of
Northwestern Medical School.

36:22.441 --> 36:23.920
- She asked
how you were doing.

36:23.964 --> 36:28.229
She said she wanted you
to re-enroll.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.578
- Huh.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.928
- I told her I had
a pretty good idea

36:31.972 --> 36:34.279
of what kind of doctor
you would make,

36:34.322 --> 36:38.761
as you've already blown us away
here as a paramedic.

36:38.805 --> 36:41.503
Be a shame to see you go.

36:41.547 --> 36:44.550
But she'd be lucky to have you.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.073
- That's really nice
of you, Chief.

36:46.116 --> 36:48.771
- Meant every word.

36:51.470 --> 36:56.126
- The thing is...

36:56.170 --> 36:59.826
I've already decided.

36:59.869 --> 37:02.263
I'm gonna decline the offer.

37:05.310 --> 37:09.923
- I went to med school
for all the wrong reasons.

37:09.966 --> 37:14.319
And it was every man
for himself.

37:14.362 --> 37:16.103
It was cutthroat.

37:16.146 --> 37:17.887
And I was

37:17.931 --> 37:20.281
holding the knife
with the rest of them.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.109
Except...

37:22.152 --> 37:24.981
it ate me up inside.

37:25.025 --> 37:28.289
Then I came here,
and everybody was like,

37:28.333 --> 37:31.858
"It's a family at 51."
And...

37:31.901 --> 37:34.469
I thought, "There's a catch."

37:34.513 --> 37:36.297
There's always a catch.

37:36.341 --> 37:42.172
Except, well, there wasn't.

37:42.216 --> 37:46.264
Not one I could see.

37:46.307 --> 37:50.268
And I realized something.

37:50.311 --> 37:54.533
I like myself here.

37:54.576 --> 37:58.363
It is a family.

37:58.406 --> 38:02.541
- And you are a part of it.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.197
Otis.

38:09.243 --> 38:12.507
- Emily Foster
drinks on me tonight.

38:12.551 --> 38:13.682
- Is that just for her

38:13.726 --> 38:16.337
or everyone?

39:03.602 --> 39:07.606

39:37.462 --> 39:38.593

39:38.637 --> 39:40.421
- Hey. I'm glad you came.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.118
- Oh, me too.

39:42.162 --> 39:44.120

and soda on the way.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.426
- Oh.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.341
You know me well.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.649
That I do.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.442
- All right, well,
cheers to that.

40:01.486 --> 40:05.707
