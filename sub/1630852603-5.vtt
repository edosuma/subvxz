to achieve.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.450

what you've been.

Yeah, bet you learned
some of that from me.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.380
I could tell you was
something special, Eli.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.174

You know, I've heard that.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.427
Something about
some money trouble?

as people are saying.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.557
I am in some debt.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.475
May have to scale back some.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.269
Maybe not go
as big as I like,

09:21.352 --> 09:22.311

it's Christmas.

You can't scale down.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.111
- That's right.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.904

I'd be happy

09:31.988 --> 09:33.155
