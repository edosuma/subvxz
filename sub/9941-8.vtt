You've had him, haven't you?

03:27.407 --> 03:29.967
You have. You've gone red. When?

No. And l'm not going to.

What's it gotta do with him?

04:12.927 --> 04:14.645
About half.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.642
He'll need to know what it'll cost him.

04:16.687 --> 04:18.483
lt was an accident.

04:18.527 --> 04:20.358
He doesn't need to know.

04:22.127 --> 04:24.118
l've booked the abortion.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.158
And?

04:30.407 --> 04:33.365
l don't know whether l'm
going to go through with it.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.396
l've not decided.

04:34.447 --> 04:35.800
lt's cost you your job.

04:35.847 --> 04:39.237
No, it hasn't. That was me.

04:39.287 --> 04:41.562
Yeah, you pregnant, tetchy, worried.

04:47.567 --> 04:52.402
l was the only girl in my class who
wasn't pregnant before her GCSEs.

04:52.447 --> 04:54.517
l've always been really proud of that.

04:57.127 --> 04:59.561
lf you're worried about what he'll say,

04:59.607 --> 05:01.882
l could come with you.

05:04.007 --> 05:05.599
No.

05:05.647 --> 05:07.558
No, he doesn't need to know.

Right, that is it!
l've told them twice this morning.

Down there, by the front.

Oi!

Next time, it'll be my baseball bat!

- For fuck's sake!
- We'll have you for that.

06:00.487 --> 06:02.842
Tell it to back of my head, loser!

06:02.887 --> 06:03.717
Oh!

06:05.087 --> 06:06.759
You big poof, sit down here.

06:06.807 --> 06:08.399
l'm fucking soaked!

06:08.447 --> 06:10.119
And my forms are ruined.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.725
Jesus, where's me tooth?

06:11.767 --> 06:15.726
You'll be all right, Frank. You've split your lip.
You might have to go hospital.

06:15.767 --> 06:16.995
Where's my tooth?

06:17.047 --> 06:18.719
We'll take him to the hospital.

06:18.767 --> 06:21.725
l can't go, look at me!

06:21.767 --> 06:23.325
That's negligence.

06:23.367 --> 06:25.517
A classic claim.

06:25.567 --> 06:29.116
- You could be a rich man here.
- Right you, out!

06:30.687 --> 06:32.962
Hang on a minute.

06:37.247 --> 06:39.397
ls this what it's come to?

Charity tins?

06:41.287 --> 06:42.606
Not for the first time.

06:42.647 --> 06:45.923
What's the point in me and lan
working our arses off after school

06:45.967 --> 06:48.800
bringing in money,
if you can just chuck a job away?

06:48.847 --> 06:49.996
You tell me.

06:50.047 --> 06:51.400
So the kids don't starve.

06:51.447 --> 06:52.675
This one's empty.

06:52.727 --> 06:54.558
lt can't be.

06:54.607 --> 06:57.360
- Have you seen the state of this?
- Yeah, l know.

06:57.407 --> 06:59.967
- But it's only till Fiona gets another job.
- Loser!

07:00.007 --> 07:03.556
Rubbish. Because she starts
work for Terry Wilson next Monday.

07:03.607 --> 07:04.562
Are you serious?

07:04.607 --> 07:08.839
He wants to see you first,
make sure you're not a minger, but yep.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.957
You are brilliant!

07:11.007 --> 07:12.679
Fiona, l take it back.

07:12.727 --> 07:14.285
You're not a lazy, dim bitch.

07:14.327 --> 07:16.761
Terry Wilson died during a bypass.

07:16.807 --> 07:20.436
You say this every time his name comes up.

07:20.487 --> 07:24.719
Terry Wilson had a bad accident
on a bypass, not during one.

07:24.767 --> 07:29.283
And he didn't die, else he wouldn't be
offering her a driving job, would he?

07:29.327 --> 07:31.363
Driving? Can't drive.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.159
You can, l've seen you.

07:33.207 --> 07:34.560
No licence.

07:34.607 --> 07:37.644
Well, tell 'em it's at the DVLA
and get a few lessons in quick.

07:37.687 --> 07:39.564
Do you want beans on these, Carol?

07:39.607 --> 07:43.202
No, thank you. l'll get myself a fish without
batter.

07:44.247 --> 07:48.160
lt comes under public safety in a place of
business.

07:48.207 --> 07:49.925
So many boxes l can tick here.

07:49.967 --> 07:52.003
Oh, Frank. You could have lost an eye.

07:52.047 --> 07:53.844
That would have been big money.

07:53.887 --> 07:56.765
l waited five hours in fucking casualty
cos some guy

07:56.807 --> 07:59.844
who'd shot himself starts queue-jumping.

08:00.367 --> 08:01.595
But he died.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.716
Oh, Frank!

08:02.767 --> 08:06.157
True, but shot himself.

08:06.207 --> 08:07.765
Hello.

08:07.807 --> 08:11.197
Nye Bevan would turn in his grave
if he thought twisted fucks like that

08:11.247 --> 08:14.239
were being prioritised over
your average working fella.

08:14.287 --> 08:16.118
And they wonder where the money goes.

08:16.167 --> 08:17.964
Director of Health Services.

08:18.007 --> 08:19.918
Fucking chimps, the lot of them.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.242
Have you any head pains, Frank?

08:22.287 --> 08:23.606
What?

08:23.647 --> 08:26.081
Oh, yeah.

08:26.127 --> 08:30.040
Good. Blurred vision?

08:30.087 --> 08:33.124
Oh, yeah.

He's got the key to the door
Never see life as it was before

08:40.167 --> 08:45.082
Too true. First drink was spiked with
a medley of LSD and Spanish Fly.

08:45.127 --> 08:47.880
Got arrested for shagging the
exhaust pipe of a Mini Metro.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.202
DV. Textbook.

08:52.087 --> 08:53.361
Double vision.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.602
Did you hear that, Sheila? l'm textbook.

08:55.647 --> 08:57.763
l'm not surprised.

08:57.807 --> 08:59.479
And that tooth wants capping pronto.

08:59.527 --> 09:01.836
l'll get you in private.

09:01.887 --> 09:03.479
Private? Thanks, love.

09:03.527 --> 09:05.916
- lt's all on the claim.
- We have a referral scheme.

09:05.967 --> 09:10.404
Remember, Frank. No win, no fee.

09:10.447 --> 09:12.403
And we will win.

09:12.447 --> 09:16.406
Just need your autograph here
and we'll make you a rich man, Frank.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.200
You obviously like him.

09:24.247 --> 09:26.397
- l don't!
- You big liar!

09:26.447 --> 09:30.520
How many times have you said that men
don't face up to their responsibilities?

09:30.567 --> 09:31.556
Never.

09:31.607 --> 09:33.598
Well l have.

09:33.647 --> 09:37.435
And if you don't tell him,
he'll find out from the CSA down the line.

09:37.487 --> 09:38.886
lf you decide to keep it.

09:38.927 --> 09:40.360
l don't need the CSA.

09:40.407 --> 09:42.637
Oh, hello! Single unemployed mum,

09:42.687 --> 09:45.440
which you will be once you start to show.

09:45.487 --> 09:48.365
- Tits are already bigger.
- Are they?

09:48.407 --> 09:53.117
Eh, nowhere near mine,
so keep your beady eyes off!

09:53.167 --> 09:56.284
Look, just go around and tell him
and tell him quick.

09:56.327 --> 09:59.558
Trust your Auntie V.

10:04.727 --> 10:06.718
Hiya. ls Frank in?

10:06.767 --> 10:09.281
We need to talk to him about this letter.

10:09.327 --> 10:10.965
Are you police officers?

10:11.007 --> 10:12.725
We're from the shop on the parade, Sheila.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.883
Oh, yeah.

10:14.927 --> 10:18.556
Sorry! Didn't recognise you
without the strip lighting. Come in.

10:18.607 --> 10:19.756
Come in.

10:25.527 --> 10:28.246
(Kash) lt was an accident, Frank.

10:28.287 --> 10:30.596
We can't afford six grand.

10:30.647 --> 10:34.686
- We'd have to close the shop.
- We don't want that, do we, Frank?

10:34.727 --> 10:35.842
They won't close!

10:35.887 --> 10:36.717
Kash.

10:36.767 --> 10:39.918
Hang on. Frank, be reasonable.

10:39.967 --> 10:42.435
l only want what's right, Kash.

10:42.487 --> 10:46.924
What's happened to trading standards?
Mary Whitehouse?

10:46.967 --> 10:49.162
lt's all in the hands of my lawyers.

10:49.207 --> 10:52.040
Don't do this. l've built that shop from scratch.

10:52.087 --> 10:53.998
Whiplash, new tooth.

10:54.047 --> 10:57.722
- You know what that costs!
- You wanker, Frank Gallagher.

10:57.767 --> 11:00.839
Don't ever show your
pathetic face in my shop again!

11:00.887 --> 11:04.562
True colours now, is it? Setting the dogs on.

11:04.607 --> 11:07.963
- Very fucking red dot.
- You wanna try earning a living like us.

11:08.007 --> 11:12.444
- Thought you were closing down!
- lt's your son you're hurting. Come on, Kash.

11:12.487 --> 11:14.603
We're wasting our time.

11:15.887 --> 11:18.720
Thanks for coming.

11:23.127 --> 11:26.085
Yvonne, have we got any more pegs in the
back?

11:26.127 --> 11:31.076
l don't know and l don't care!
We're closing up. Come on you lot, out!

11:31.127 --> 11:32.082
What's happened?

11:32.127 --> 11:35.517
Your dad. Frank Gallagher!
That's what's happened.

11:35.567 --> 11:37.922
l'm closing up. You're out of a job.

11:37.967 --> 11:39.320
l'm waiting to be served, here.

11:39.367 --> 11:40.925
Whatever it is, have it!

11:40.967 --> 11:44.039
l will not be blackmailed by people round here.

11:44.087 --> 11:46.760
lf they wanna treat us like this,
they don't deserve a shop.

11:46.807 --> 11:50.322
l forgot. l wanted two tins of salmon.
Can l take them as well?

11:50.367 --> 11:51.356
Don't push it!

11:51.407 --> 11:54.479
lan, l'm sorry, but you're gonna have to go
home.

11:54.527 --> 11:57.246
Kash, do the shutters!

11:59.447 --> 12:03.201
Can everyone leave now, please!
This shop is no longer open for business.

12:03.247 --> 12:04.805
You don't have to do this.

12:04.847 --> 12:06.644
Kash, this is my shop.

12:06.687 --> 12:10.885
lan, l'm sorry, but l've no choice here.

12:27.527 --> 12:28.482
ls Craig in?

12:28.527 --> 12:29.755
Yeah, come in.

12:29.807 --> 12:31.763
Craig, visitor.

12:31.807 --> 12:34.719
Hello, stranger. Long time, no see.

12:34.767 --> 12:35.995
l just came to have a word.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.436
Right. This is Sue.

12:38.487 --> 12:39.966
- Hiya.
- Me wife.

12:41.647 --> 12:43.046
Oh, right.

12:43.487 --> 12:46.001
- Hi.
- This is Fiona.

12:46.047 --> 12:48.607
- Don't worry, it doesn't change anything.
- We're not together.

12:48.647 --> 12:51.764
We haven't touched in two and a half years.
Can't get shot of her!

12:51.807 --> 12:54.605
That's because the tight-arsed gimp
won't give me what he owes me.

12:54.647 --> 12:55.966
There's two sides to that.

12:56.007 --> 12:58.475
Don't touch the pasta in the fridge,
l'm having it later.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.644
Technically, this is all half mine.
Otherwise l'd be long gone.

13:01.687 --> 13:04.759
Yours as in it was your dad
who worked all his life to pay for it?

13:04.807 --> 13:06.684
No, mine as in rightful settlement.

13:06.727 --> 13:08.763
Watch him.

13:08.807 --> 13:10.035
Welcome to my world.

13:18.127 --> 13:19.765
Fiona!

13:27.247 --> 13:29.238
A flat three grand for this.

13:29.287 --> 13:31.198
Or so my lawyer tells me.

13:31.247 --> 13:34.523
Well, your face is your fortune, innit, Frank?

13:34.567 --> 13:37.127
Hey, Jez. Could we say l work here?

13:37.167 --> 13:39.476
Bring in a sick note. Loss of earnings.

13:39.527 --> 13:43.679
lf l said you worked here, Frank,
health and safety would shut me down.

13:43.727 --> 13:45.957
Oh, come on. The money l spend in here.

13:46.007 --> 13:50.239
D'you wanna see your bar tab? Claim for that
and tell them you were driven to drink!

13:50.287 --> 13:51.800
You bastard!

13:51.847 --> 13:54.156
You stupid fucking bastard!

13:54.207 --> 13:57.005
- Jesus, what the fuck was that for?
- Out!

13:57.047 --> 13:58.958
Shop's had to close cos of him!

13:59.007 --> 14:00.998
They can't afford to keep it open.

14:01.047 --> 14:04.926
l'm out of a job, Kash is out of a job,
your family's on the breadline,

14:04.967 --> 14:06.161
and you don't give a fuck!

14:06.207 --> 14:09.165
- What are you talking about?
- ls it shut?

14:09.207 --> 14:12.597
Ask him! He's suing the shop
and they've had to close.

14:12.647 --> 14:15.719
Where are we gonna shop
with that place gone?

14:15.767 --> 14:18.361
lt's a half-mile walk to the precinct.

14:18.407 --> 14:22.798
Something's up. Yvonne were kicking off
terrible and she chucked me out.

14:22.847 --> 14:24.519
So is it fucking shut?!

14:24.567 --> 14:26.762
Yes. She were cursing him.

14:26.807 --> 14:29.002
Right you, we're not serving you.

14:29.047 --> 14:30.321
You can't bar me!

14:30.367 --> 14:33.677
We're not barring you, Frank.
We're just not choosing to serve you.

14:33.727 --> 14:35.843
Due to popular demand.

14:35.887 --> 14:38.162
Do we wanna serve someone
who's closing our amenities?

14:38.207 --> 14:40.562
- (All) No!
- See.

14:48.687 --> 14:52.043
l don't believe this. l'm really sorry, lan.

14:52.087 --> 14:53.918
l'm not finding him a job as well.

14:53.967 --> 14:56.959
Yours better work out,
or we're up shit creek without a paddle.

15:04.727 --> 15:06.558
You all right?

15:06.607 --> 15:08.359
l can't keep it now.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.716
l really need this job, V.

15:10.767 --> 15:13.281
You'll be all right.
Have you been round to lover boy's?

15:13.327 --> 15:15.443
- Yeah.
- And?

15:15.487 --> 15:16.636
l met his wife.

15:16.687 --> 15:17.961
He's married! Jesus!

15:18.007 --> 15:21.044
- Who's married?
- Nothing. No-one.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.805
You're gonna have to tell 'em.

15:28.047 --> 15:29.002
l'm pregnant.

15:29.047 --> 15:31.436
l knew it. l knew you were.

15:31.487 --> 15:33.955
You did not. Everyone says that.

15:34.007 --> 15:38.046
l did. l've been knitting bootees for a week.
They're in my room.

15:38.087 --> 15:39.998
How did you get pregnant?

15:40.047 --> 15:43.244
- Don't be thick. Shit, Fiona.
- Whose is it?

15:43.287 --> 15:45.482
You don't know him.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.358
Congratulations.

15:47.407 --> 15:49.602
Another mouth to feed.

15:49.647 --> 15:51.046
Thank you.

15:51.087 --> 15:52.884
l'm going to bed.

15:54.447 --> 15:55.926
Up the duff!

15:57.687 --> 16:00.485
l know how you get pregnant.

16:09.847 --> 16:10.916
KNOCK ON DOOR >

16:16.367 --> 16:19.120
One more won't make much difference.

16:33.687 --> 16:35.040
Prick!

16:49.407 --> 16:51.557
Slaphead! For fuck's sake!

16:58.287 --> 17:01.563
Come on, Fiona.
Don't wanna be late on your first day.

17:01.607 --> 17:02.835
What you on about?

17:04.807 --> 17:06.126
You can't drive on your own.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.566
Not on your provisional.

17:07.607 --> 17:09.086
l can drive.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.516
No-one's gonna know.
l'll easily get away with it.

17:11.567 --> 17:12.636
What if you get stopped?

17:12.686 --> 17:15.121
You'll be out of another job. Not clever.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.203
Someone's gotta sit with you, then it's legal.

17:17.247 --> 17:18.919
When was this decided?

17:18.967 --> 17:20.400
(All) Last night.

17:20.446 --> 17:23.086
Marty was the only one we
knew with a clean licence.

17:23.127 --> 17:26.756
He's been inside too
long to run up any points.

17:26.807 --> 17:28.638
Oh, God help me!

17:28.687 --> 17:29.642
See ya.

17:29.687 --> 17:32.804
(Debbie) Have a nice time. Bye.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.403
l've come for the money you owe me.

17:54.447 --> 17:57.120
Can help with the stocktake
if you wanna earn a bit more.

17:59.247 --> 18:01.124
Are you really gonna close?

18:01.167 --> 18:04.955
Got chance of a unit. Croft Estate, Valesworth.

18:05.007 --> 18:06.326
That's miles away!

18:06.367 --> 18:10.360
l can apply for a start-up grant.
They're giving them away up there.

18:10.407 --> 18:12.284
More money than there is round here.

18:12.327 --> 18:14.522
Could be best thing that ever happened.

18:17.007 --> 18:19.237
Oh, don't start.

18:19.287 --> 18:21.721
What choice have we got?

18:21.767 --> 18:22.756
lt's either this,

18:22.807 --> 18:26.277
or we watch his dad piss away
our hard-earned money in t'Jockey.

18:26.327 --> 18:27.601
They've barred him.

18:27.647 --> 18:29.717
Why, what's he done now?

18:29.767 --> 18:32.406
Shut this shop. They hate him.

18:32.447 --> 18:35.359
lt's nice to know there's some justice in t'world.

18:37.767 --> 18:39.246
l'll leave you two.

18:40.887 --> 18:44.118
l was gonna come and see you.

18:44.167 --> 18:46.078
lt's not fair.

18:46.127 --> 18:47.845
We'll still see each other.

18:47.887 --> 18:50.924
When, Kash? And where?

18:50.967 --> 18:53.003
The back of your van?

18:54.687 --> 18:55.676
Come here.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.359
lAN SOBS

19:06.087 --> 19:09.204
Where's your dad drinking then, lan?

19:09.247 --> 19:13.320
Nowhere. They've all barred him.

19:13.367 --> 19:15.119
Well, you'd better be right.

19:15.167 --> 19:19.683
- Cos l'll have your balls if this plan don't work.
- What plan?

19:47.367 --> 19:50.279
- What are you doing, Marty?
- lt's my mirror.

19:50.327 --> 19:53.603
lf l'm responsible for the vehicle,
l've got to have one of these.

19:53.647 --> 19:55.000
Where'd you get it?

19:55.047 --> 19:56.560
l found it.

19:56.607 --> 19:59.280
There's a motorcycle overtaking now.

19:59.327 --> 20:00.999
All right, l can see it.

20:01.047 --> 20:04.244
Who the fuck nicks a driving mirror?!

20:06.607 --> 20:09.280
Here, make yourself useful.

20:09.327 --> 20:12.285
Look up that address in this.

20:12.327 --> 20:14.363
< Headlamps!

20:14.407 --> 20:17.285
lf you offset the loss of business against the
claim,

20:17.327 --> 20:19.283
it's eight days before we're out of pocket.

20:19.327 --> 20:22.080
But l'm holding out for no more than two, lan.

20:22.127 --> 20:23.355
There's 200.

20:23.407 --> 20:29.721
Right, get these to everyone who has
a paper and any other doors you pass.

20:29.767 --> 20:31.883
Your dad is gonna be begging us to open.

20:31.927 --> 20:33.758
Sorry love, we're closed.

20:33.807 --> 20:36.765
Legal reasons. Frank Gallagher's fault.

20:36.807 --> 20:39.560
That's Frank Gallagher.

20:39.607 --> 20:41.120
Off you go, you two.

21:19.127 --> 21:20.606
Pint, please.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.683
A pint of what, Sheila?

21:23.727 --> 21:25.558
Just a pint.

21:31.767 --> 21:34.839
l'm not serving you, Frank.
More than my job's worth.

21:34.887 --> 21:37.959
Christ's sake, give me the fucking Oscar.

21:38.007 --> 21:40.043
Come on, a quick one. Jess will never know.

21:40.087 --> 21:41.315
No, but they will.

21:43.607 --> 21:48.078
- They've lost the shop, Frank. They're angry.
- Give over, they can shop anywhere.

21:48.127 --> 21:50.357
Shops? lt's not fucking Warsaw!

21:50.407 --> 21:51.726
(Man) lt's as good as. >

21:58.727 --> 22:01.958
Come on, Frank, everybody's looking.

22:03.287 --> 22:05.755
Give us an E to take away.

22:09.047 --> 22:11.197
Keep it to yourself.

22:14.287 --> 22:15.436
Just a pint!

22:15.487 --> 22:18.763
Sorry, Frank. He caught me off guard.

22:18.807 --> 22:21.401
l kept thinking whisky,
but l knew that wasn't right.

22:21.447 --> 22:22.926
All you had to fucking do...

22:22.967 --> 22:25.242
Ah! Blood!

22:25.287 --> 22:27.755
- l've been shot!
- Fucking hell!

22:27.807 --> 22:30.560
Oh, my God, Frank!

22:33.767 --> 22:35.166
lt's a fucking egg!

22:38.527 --> 22:41.485
LOUD SCREAMlNG

22:42.327 --> 22:45.205
(Man) You're a dead man, Gallagher! >

22:45.247 --> 22:46.839
Fuck off!

22:50.647 --> 22:52.638
Here you go, five sugars.

22:56.567 --> 22:58.046
Fiona!

23:02.727 --> 23:05.799
Fiona... Not a chance.

23:05.847 --> 23:07.166
D'you want the baby?

23:08.967 --> 23:11.242
l don't want to talk about it, Marty.

23:11.287 --> 23:15.246
Because it... lf you want to keep it,
you don't have to bring it up alone,

23:15.287 --> 23:17.039
if you don't want. Shitting!

23:18.607 --> 23:20.359
Thanks.

23:20.407 --> 23:21.886
l'd do anything for you.

23:25.887 --> 23:28.321
Look, Marty.

23:28.367 --> 23:30.835
Thing is, l'm not gonna have it.

23:32.367 --> 23:35.757
l need to keep this job,
or we've got no money coming in.

23:35.807 --> 23:38.162
lt wouldn't be a good idea right now.

23:39.807 --> 23:41.923
l'm booked in for the morning.

23:41.967 --> 23:44.003
But thanks.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.878
Right.

23:47.967 --> 23:49.878
l suppose that's for the best, though.

23:51.927 --> 23:53.406
ls it?

23:55.887 --> 23:57.798
You don't have to do this, you know.

23:57.847 --> 24:00.407
Sitting with me.

24:00.447 --> 24:02.642
lt's very kind, l'm really grateful.

24:02.687 --> 24:06.157
lt's fine, l like it... Wanker!

24:06.207 --> 24:07.686
Not you.

24:14.287 --> 24:17.563
l am dropping the charges,
you can have the shop back!

24:17.607 --> 24:20.167
CHEERlNG

24:20.847 --> 24:23.122
Now pour us a pint.

24:23.167 --> 24:26.477
Let's see you do it first.

24:49.967 --> 24:53.118
Remind me to pick up some free condoms
while l'm here.

25:00.207 --> 25:04.359
You seen the state of her?
How did she get a bun in the oven?

25:14.967 --> 25:16.446
Fiona Gallagher?

25:20.607 --> 25:23.440
- Shall l come with?
- No, l'll be fine.

25:23.487 --> 25:24.966
See you in a bit.

25:37.087 --> 25:41.717
lt's what this country's all about, innit?
l mean, they're hard workers

25:41.767 --> 25:45.396
and they represent the values of our way of life.

25:45.447 --> 25:47.881
Late night opening,

25:47.927 --> 25:49.406
fair prices,

25:49.447 --> 25:52.803
and...affordability.

25:52.847 --> 25:55.645
l'm proud to announce, back open.

25:57.287 --> 25:59.755
Right, going home, got a headache.

26:03.927 --> 26:07.681
Before you say anything,
we've had to make one or two price rises.

26:07.727 --> 26:09.445
lt's because of the loss of business.

26:09.487 --> 26:13.082
But if you offset that against your bus fares
you've been paying, you're still saving.

26:16.247 --> 26:17.726
A total victory!

26:17.767 --> 26:20.281
Yeah, well get out there
and make yourself worthwhile!

26:32.567 --> 26:34.956
Stick the kettle on, Sheila.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.841
Oh, sweet Jesus, what do you two want?

26:37.887 --> 26:40.606
Tell me you haven't gone
and cancelled your claim, Frank.

26:40.647 --> 26:43.559
Look... l don't want to talk about it.

26:43.607 --> 26:45.006
You can't pull out now.

26:45.047 --> 26:47.845
Wheels in motion, Frank.
They've explained it to me.

26:47.887 --> 26:50.799
Look. We spent best part of a day with you,
Frank.

26:50.847 --> 26:54.476
Oh, Christ, l can't do right for
doing fucking wrong round here.

26:54.527 --> 27:00.477
You know, l have had...eggs and
stuff, so no more. Finito.

27:00.527 --> 27:05.203
Frank, l don't think you quite understand.
This is your bill. Read the small print.

27:05.247 --> 27:10.958
lf you terminate the claim prior to completion,
any costs incurred by the company

27:11.007 --> 27:13.965
- are passed onto the client - you, Frank.
- You what?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.316
- lt is in there, you signed it.
- What fucking costs?

27:16.367 --> 27:19.996
Letters, dental work, admin costs.

27:20.047 --> 27:22.322
£926.47 p.

27:24.647 --> 27:27.684
Oh, my God, Frank. What have you done?

27:27.727 --> 27:29.843
BABY CRlES

27:52.647 --> 27:54.877
How are you?

27:54.927 --> 27:56.485
Fine.

27:56.527 --> 27:58.722
So don't all stare at me.

27:58.767 --> 28:00.644
We wondered where you were.

28:01.767 --> 28:05.077
What? Carl, what?

28:05.127 --> 28:06.276
What's the matter?

28:07.247 --> 28:08.885
All right?

28:09.687 --> 28:11.006
Fuck you doing here?

28:11.047 --> 28:12.446
Wanted a word.

28:12.487 --> 28:16.765
- l told him to come back later, but he wouldn't.
- That's fine.

28:16.807 --> 28:20.800
- Look, if it's a bad time...
- No, no. You might as well stay.

28:20.847 --> 28:23.998
- ls everything all right?
- (Fiona) Yeah.

28:24.047 --> 28:25.560
And?

28:27.247 --> 28:29.238
l'd better explain.

28:29.287 --> 28:31.437
Right, l'd better be off. Washing up to do.

28:31.487 --> 28:34.160
Probably. You know where l am if you need me.

28:37.487 --> 28:39.955
l went for an abortion today.

28:41.287 --> 28:44.563
Right. Sorry.

28:44.607 --> 28:46.962
But l didn't have it.

28:47.007 --> 28:49.396
l couldn't.

28:49.447 --> 28:54.726
l feel...different, in a good way.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.405
l just couldn't do it.

28:56.447 --> 28:59.200
So l'm keeping it. So don't start.

29:03.127 --> 29:05.243
Look, this is a bad time...

29:05.287 --> 29:07.960
lt's yours, by the way.

29:10.527 --> 29:12.245
l've been trying to tell you.

29:12.287 --> 29:16.121
l thought if l knew you a bit better,
it might make more sense.

29:16.167 --> 29:20.365
But then everything seemed to go wrong. Sorry.

29:20.407 --> 29:22.125
lt's OK, though.

29:22.167 --> 29:24.158
l've sorted it all out.

29:24.207 --> 29:25.526
You should have told me.

29:25.567 --> 29:28.365
l might have if your wife
hadn't answered the door.

29:28.407 --> 29:32.161
l didn't know you were going to turn up.
l wasn't hiding it.

29:32.207 --> 29:33.959
lt doesn't matter.

29:34.007 --> 29:36.441
You were right, it's nothing to do with me.

29:36.487 --> 29:39.763
What, and you thought once you'd told me,
you'd never see me again?

29:39.807 --> 29:42.605
- lt's what most blokes round here do!
- Bollocks!

29:42.647 --> 29:45.161
Most of them get married
and really fuck things up.

29:45.207 --> 29:47.721
You haven't got that option. Nor do l.

29:48.767 --> 29:50.883
l'm not asking for anything.

29:50.927 --> 29:53.316
lt doesn't involve you.

29:53.367 --> 29:56.086
Do l not have that option either?

29:58.407 --> 29:59.920
l don't know.

30:02.127 --> 30:04.197
So how long have you been married?

30:04.247 --> 30:07.239
Years. Well, feels like years.

30:07.287 --> 30:09.118
Can't get shot of her.

30:09.167 --> 30:12.079
lt's my dad's house,
but she's claiming it's half hers.

30:12.127 --> 30:15.722
l wouldn't care, but he's still alive, just.

30:15.767 --> 30:20.397
l was working on the oil rigs when we
first met. l think that suited her.

30:20.447 --> 30:22.278
l'd go away and she'd go shopping.

30:23.607 --> 30:25.120
D'you wanna know the irony?

30:25.167 --> 30:28.159
l've wanted a little girl for years,
just not with you.

30:28.207 --> 30:29.003
Oh!

30:29.047 --> 30:33.996
l don't mean with somebody like you,
just somebody l'd planned it with.

30:34.047 --> 30:35.765
So were you trying?

30:35.807 --> 30:37.763
l thought we were.

30:37.807 --> 30:42.517
Turned out she was using enough
contraceptives to sterilise an elephant.

30:44.607 --> 30:46.484
Why do you say a little girl?

30:48.087 --> 30:50.726
l had a sister that got hit by a car.

30:51.767 --> 30:52.961
ls that true?

30:53.007 --> 30:54.963
Yeah, course it is.

30:55.007 --> 30:56.486
Who'd make that up?

31:11.727 --> 31:14.560
All right, Paddy.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.916
Hey, Paddy!

31:16.967 --> 31:20.164
Didn't you win the...wotsit, lottery,
a few weeks back?

31:20.207 --> 31:22.084
No, Frank, it was my brother Martin.

31:22.127 --> 31:23.958
Right, but...

31:24.007 --> 31:27.238
Could you ask him to lend me
a few hundred quid, just for a week.

31:27.287 --> 31:29.960
- l can ask him, Frank, but he won't do it.
- Oh, come on!

31:30.007 --> 31:35.843
He won £75, Frank, and he's still has got that
fine to pay cos of you. Good night.

31:37.967 --> 31:40.356
Fucking...

31:42.847 --> 31:45.315
MUTTERS TO HlMSELF

31:54.487 --> 31:57.206
Oh, well l phoned as soon
as the lines were open,

31:57.247 --> 31:59.886
so l don't see how l could be too late.

32:00.927 --> 32:02.997
OK, fingers crossed for next time.

32:03.047 --> 32:04.526
Bye.

32:05.207 --> 32:07.801
Some people are so snooty.
BANGlNG >

32:08.847 --> 32:12.999
Come in! Oh, that's perfect. Here you are, Carl.

32:13.047 --> 32:15.038
Congratulations on the baby, by the way.

32:15.087 --> 32:19.285
What does that make me?
A half granny or a step granny?

32:19.327 --> 32:22.717
Either way, it is a bit of a mouthful.
Your dad was so moved.

32:24.167 --> 32:27.842
Holiday to Florida, £500 spending money,
GMR, 1 5 minutes.

32:27.887 --> 32:30.685
We'll just take the spending money. Can't fly.

32:30.727 --> 32:32.001
What's going on?

32:32.047 --> 32:35.084
Phone-ins. l'm going to get us the money back.

32:35.127 --> 32:38.676
Your dad's inconsolable. He tried to sell
his cap back to the dentist this morning.

32:38.727 --> 32:40.319
You're gonna win it?

32:40.367 --> 32:42.323
l have done them before.

32:42.367 --> 32:44.005
When Karen was little.

32:44.047 --> 32:46.083
Year's supply of mini yogurts.

32:46.127 --> 32:48.004
The secret's in the tie-breakers.

32:48.047 --> 32:49.844
l'm a natural.

32:49.887 --> 32:52.799
l've done two quizzes on the radio already.
Ha, ha, ha!

32:52.847 --> 32:55.486
- Bit of a long shot, isn't it?
- Someone's got to win.

32:55.527 --> 32:58.121
Do you want to play beat the intro, Sheila?

32:58.167 --> 33:01.842
(Deep breaths) Whatever! Ha-ha-ha!

33:01.887 --> 33:03.161
l need to get off.

33:03.207 --> 33:04.765
Good luck.

33:04.807 --> 33:08.720
Yeah. Your dad is so proud of you.

33:08.767 --> 33:11.645
lt never rains, but it fucking pours.

33:11.687 --> 33:14.997
You try and bring your kids up with
some self-respect, and then what?

33:15.047 --> 33:17.561
Your daughter, the apple of your eye

33:17.607 --> 33:22.237
is up the duff by some Tom, Dick and Harry.
Where do we go wrong?

33:22.287 --> 33:25.324
- Have you tried leading by example?
- What about Liam?

33:25.367 --> 33:27.517
- He's yours, Frank.
- l know that,

33:27.567 --> 33:29.797
but she can't just walk out and leave him.

33:29.847 --> 33:31.280
'Are you there, Sheila?'

33:31.327 --> 33:33.795
l'm on the air, call Karen. Call Karen.

33:33.847 --> 33:35.758
Yes, hello, l'm still here, Dickie.

33:39.087 --> 33:40.805
Fucking hell, not you two again.

33:40.847 --> 33:44.123
Sheila! Look, it's Sheila on Grab My Grand!

33:44.167 --> 33:46.965
'l know that one. ls it Puffin lsland?'

33:47.007 --> 33:50.363
'Correct. What is the capital of Spain?'

33:50.407 --> 33:54.366
Barcelona! l went at Easter
with the two Marthas, £7 return.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.556
ls it fuck, it's Lisbon.

33:55.607 --> 33:57.677

34:03.687 --> 34:06.645
'but if you are wrong,
you go away with absolutely nothing.

34:06.687 --> 34:09.759
'So here we go.
How many sides has a dodecahedron?'

34:12.887 --> 34:14.922
Fucking great!

34:14.967 --> 34:17.242
'Oh dear, let me think.

34:17.286 --> 34:19.676
'Dodecahedron, how many sides...

34:21.206 --> 34:24.040
'l'm going to have to push you for an answer,
Sheila.'

'Oh, dear, oh, dear... Oh, what can it be? Um...

34:27.887 --> 34:29.797
'Oh, um, er....'

34:31.167 --> 34:32.725

Ah! Sheila, we've won!

34:46.726 --> 34:49.560
Oh, Jesus!

34:50.687 --> 34:53.996
l saw that, that was assault.

34:54.047 --> 34:56.003
What are you talking about?

34:56.047 --> 34:57.081
l didn't move.

34:57.127 --> 35:00.085
Sorry mate, not from where l'm standing.

35:00.127 --> 35:02.482
And unless you call off them swindling lawyers,

35:02.527 --> 35:06.759
there's about 20 witnesses here
that'll swear that you just hit him.

35:06.807 --> 35:08.843
- lt wasn't me, it was...
- All right Frank?

35:10.527 --> 35:12.597
My fucking cap's come off.

35:12.647 --> 35:15.366
- This is a fit up.
- Yeah.

35:15.407 --> 35:17.443
Fuck you, ginger!

35:17.487 --> 35:20.001
- Call the police, Jez.
- Just do it, Barry.

Your dad's gonna love it.
Pass the other T, Carl.

35:26.447 --> 35:29.120
Can we put it in the window?

lf you like.

35:34.887 --> 35:37.924
Your bill's cleared, Frank.
Now you're down as a bad debt.

35:37.967 --> 35:40.117
Hope it makes you happy.

35:40.167 --> 35:42.635
Come on, let's have a party!

35:54.007 --> 35:55.725
Hiya.

35:55.767 --> 35:57.325
Can l get you a drink, then?

35:57.367 --> 36:01.997
Given this was your idea, mine's a pint.
l'll grab a table.

36:02.047 --> 36:03.036
Fiona.

36:03.087 --> 36:07.842
You're all right, Dad. l'm still going to look after
Liam, so you can fuck off!

36:07.887 --> 36:09.798
Sorry l spoke.

36:10.847 --> 36:13.805
- The kid should know who its dad is.
- Course it should.

36:13.847 --> 36:16.361
You're not having any formal visiting rights.

36:16.407 --> 36:18.204
l'm not asking for that and l won't.

36:19.727 --> 36:22.116
Be a good-looking kid, though, eh?

36:22.167 --> 36:24.283
Taking after the father, l suppose.

36:24.327 --> 36:25.806
Taking after both of us.

36:27.447 --> 36:28.880
lt'll be all right, you know.

36:28.927 --> 36:30.883
l know.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.361
Best we don't get too involved.

36:33.407 --> 36:35.045
Absolutely.

36:35.087 --> 36:36.406
Could just fuck it all up.

He was celebrating last night.

37:33.887 --> 37:36.242
Has he heard already?
They must have called him.

You're a free man.

40:10.767 --> 40:14.203
A thousand fucking quid.

40:14.247 --> 40:16.397
There is nearly £80 change.

40:16.447 --> 40:18.881
That won't pay the bar bill.

40:27.007 --> 40:28.326
This came this morning.

40:28.367 --> 40:30.927
Second prize - Satin FM.

40:30.967 --> 40:34.676
Frank, l'm getting quite a taste for this.

40:34.727 --> 40:38.561
l should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky

40:38.607 --> 40:40.916
l should be so lucky...

40:40.967 --> 40:43.561
(Fiona) 'Sheila celebrated
winning that money for weeks.

40:43.607 --> 40:47.600
'For the rest of us, the notion of another mouth
to feed wasn't anything new,

40:47.647 --> 40:52.277
'but the idea that it wasn't another offspring
of Dad's took a bit of getting used to.'

40:53.687 --> 40:57.123
l'm a good human being
with a great deal to offer.

40:57.167 --> 40:59.317
- NOOOOOOOOOOO!
- Ahhh!

40:59.367 --> 41:04.202
Once the court see you're respectable and
hard-working, they'll have to acquit you.

41:04.247 --> 41:06.124
- Boo!
- Aaargh!

41:06.167 --> 41:07.600
So why are you back?

41:07.647 --> 41:10.115
Because, Blondie, l fell in love.

41:14.847 --> 41:16.246
Marty, no!

41:16.287 --> 41:19.962
Did you think somebody like her
would be interested in a freak like you?

41:20.007 --> 41:21.804
Beauty's everywhere.

41:21.847 --> 41:24.042
Just depends whether you choose to see it.

41:24.087 --> 41:26.601
(Marty) 'l'm a good human being

41:26.647 --> 41:28.478
'with a great deal to offer.

41:28.527 --> 41:29.516
'l am a...'

41:30.247 --> 41:31.362
Boner! Sorry!

42:18.327 --> 42:20.716
Eight letters, COPULATE!

42:20.767 --> 42:22.280
SHE LAUGHS

42:22.327 --> 42:23.521
Sorry.
