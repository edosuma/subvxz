So, when Clara says she doesn't think
you want to have sex with her anymore,

01:09.445 --> 01:10.885
how does that make you feel?

01:12.765 --> 01:13.685
Bad.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.845
Descriptive words, Tim?

01:16.365 --> 01:17.485
Um...

01:18.845 --> 01:19.965
Really bad.

[Jean] All right, Clara,
I'd really like to see you focus

on what you're actually feeling.

[normal voice] Hello.

01:39.885 --> 01:41.085
My name is Milburn.

01:41.765 --> 01:43.205
I am a sex therapist.

01:44.885 --> 01:45.925
How do you feel?

01:46.525 --> 01:47.605
How do you...

01:48.365 --> 01:49.605
feel today?

01:53.005 --> 01:54.445
[arguing]

01:55.045 --> 01:57.445
-I'm just trying to--
-Just trying to what?

-Air our dirty underpants, is that it?
-No!

02:00.605 --> 02:01.845
So, it's rom-com night.

02:01.925 --> 02:05.845
I'm thinking 1980s Julia Roberts
or early noughties Kate Hudson.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.845
-What's your preference?
-Mum, what...

02:09.365 --> 02:10.485
What makes a good therapist?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.125
Just curious.

02:13.365 --> 02:14.285
Well...

02:15.245 --> 02:17.845
I guess some therapists get into it
for the wrong reasons.

02:18.205 --> 02:20.445
They do it for money or status.

02:20.525 --> 02:23.885
They think of it as a...
career rather than a vocation.

02:23.965 --> 02:25.325
But it... it's just a job.

02:25.885 --> 02:26.765
Sure.

02:27.005 --> 02:30.805
A job where one wrong word
could trigger a nervous breakdown,

02:30.885 --> 02:33.045
resulting in decades of emotional damage.

02:33.405 --> 02:36.885
A good therapist, a, you know...
a "good" therapist,

02:37.805 --> 02:40.085
I guess understands
the weight of that responsibility.

02:41.085 --> 02:43.485
-That sounds intense.
-Well, it's a fine balance,

02:43.605 --> 02:45.005
listening to people

02:45.685 --> 02:48.485
without inserting yourself
into their reality.

02:48.565 --> 02:49.805
So it's not about you.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.405
Mm. Exactly.

02:53.525 --> 02:56.645
[whispers] And more importantly,
Roberts or Hudson?

02:57.165 --> 02:58.605
Um... Roberts.

02:59.765 --> 03:02.485
-Okay. Roberts it is.

03:10.005 --> 03:11.245
[Eric] You're wearing a tie.

03:12.365 --> 03:13.605
Yeah, I suppose I am.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.965
It’s Aimee G’s house party tonight.

03:17.285 --> 03:18.645
Yeah, and?

03:18.725 --> 03:22.565
And? Apparently, last time,
Warhammer Tom drank 14 Jägerbombs

03:22.645 --> 03:24.085
and nearly drowned in her hot tub.

03:24.165 --> 03:25.125
We need an invite!

03:25.205 --> 03:26.765

-An eternally optimistic goldfish.

-Oh, hello, Otis!
-Hi.

03:35.245 --> 03:37.885

-Harry. Sorry. I'm bad with names.

-Wha-- What can I do for you, Harry?
-Well, I was just passing through.

03:54.205 --> 03:56.685
I thought maybe we could pop
and get a bit of breakfast together.

03:57.005 --> 03:58.445
I-- I had a good time the other night.

03:58.525 --> 04:00.885
It's so rare to find a woman
who really listens, you know.

04:00.965 --> 04:01.925
I see.

04:02.645 --> 04:05.165
I'm about to teach a vagina workshop.

04:05.805 --> 04:07.365
So... no?

-How about tonight then? Dinner?
-I've got plans tonight.

04:11.525 --> 04:13.485
-Sometime this week?
-Look, Harry,

04:13.565 --> 04:16.045
I'm really sorry
if I gave you the wrong impression.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.685
I'm not interested in dating anyone.

04:18.005 --> 04:21.365
I'm extremely busy with work
and raising my son,

04:21.445 --> 04:23.005
and I just have no room in my life

04:23.085 --> 04:25.325
for the kind of intimacy
that you are clearly craving.

04:25.405 --> 04:29.365
But I really commend you
on your directness and your bravado

04:29.445 --> 04:31.685
and I really hope that you find
what you're looking for.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.405

-Uh, explain?

05:25.885 --> 05:29.005
I did something stupid. Maeve asked me
to set up this sex therapy thing

05:29.085 --> 05:32.245
to help students with their problems,
for money, and I agreed,

05:32.565 --> 05:36.165

'cause I'm all confused, and... and hot.

-She wants you to be a sex therapist?
-Yes.

05:38.565 --> 05:40.845
-But you can't wank!
-I know, and I'm 16 years old,

05:40.925 --> 05:42.285
and I feel clammy...

05:42.725 --> 05:45.725
-I'm all dizzy and hot.
-Okay, okay. Okay, take a chill pill.

05:46.885 --> 05:49.165
-[sighs]
-So think about it. This could be awesome.

05:50.245 --> 05:51.845
A sex therapist.

05:51.925 --> 05:54.445
Listen, knowledge is power,
power is status,

05:54.525 --> 05:56.165
and status means popular.

05:56.245 --> 05:58.245
-You can be popular.
-I don't want to be popular.

05:58.645 --> 06:01.205
I just want be a guy in the corner
that no one knows, you know?

06:01.285 --> 06:02.685
And they say, "Who’s that guy?"

06:02.765 --> 06:04.605
And they go,
"He's just a guy in the corner."

06:04.685 --> 06:06.005
Wait, you wanna be in a corner?

06:07.405 --> 06:08.445

hang out with Maeve Wiley?

-But she's not popular, she's scary.
-Yeah, exactly.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.565
She's better than popular,
because she's cool.

06:20.645 --> 06:21.885
And she’s the best kind of cool,

06:21.965 --> 06:23.845
because no one in this place
even knows it yet.

06:24.085 --> 06:25.925
But you don't wanna hang out with her.
I get it.

-Uh-huh, uh-huh. Of course you do.

-Mm-hm.

-Sorry, Adam.

with you anymore.

07:57.445 --> 07:58.445
Why not?

you know, a... a sex pervert.

08:02.725 --> 08:04.205
See ya at Aimee's party, man!

are highly flammable, okay?

08:13.965 --> 08:16.405

last year with Mr. Moorhouse.

08:16.485 --> 08:18.725

won't you, Trimble?

08:18.805 --> 08:21.565
Just get on with it, please. Thank you.

08:24.005 --> 08:25.205
We're finished, Adam.

-Fake it till I make it. Fake it...
-Think of someone strong.

-Like Putin. Or Beyoncé.
-What'd you bring him for?

Uh, where he goes, I go.

Ugh. Whatever. She's in there.

-Do I have to look at her?
-[Maeve] No.

-No.

[girl] Hello?

09:25.685 --> 09:26.685
[clears throat]

09:26.765 --> 09:28.965
[deep voice]
Hello, I'm your therapist today.

09:29.485 --> 09:33.845
-[sighs] How... might I serve you?
-This is weird.

09:33.925 --> 09:36.485
-Can't we just talk face to face?
-No, we shouldn't see each other.

09:37.005 --> 09:39.125
[stammers]
How can-- How can I help you?

09:39.405 --> 09:41.725
Didn't Maeve tell you?
I just-- I don't wanna say it again.

09:41.805 --> 09:44.125
Yes! Yes, you, uh... [clears throat]

09:44.205 --> 09:46.885
You encountered some problems
during fellatio,

09:46.965 --> 09:50.525
which resulted in you experiencing
a bout of emesis, correct?

09:50.885 --> 09:52.765
-Emesis?
-Uh, vomiting.

09:53.565 --> 09:56.885
Yeah, I puked on his dick, all right?
He says I shouldn't give BJs anymore.

09:56.965 --> 09:59.245
But if I don't go down on him,
he won't go down on me.

09:59.325 --> 10:01.445
-So what do I do? What do I do?
-[muffled sigh]

10:02.125 --> 10:03.205
Well...

10:04.045 --> 10:08.445
human sexuality is far more varied
than you might realize,

10:08.525 --> 10:12.565
and each person
has a history of unique experiences,

10:12.645 --> 10:15.685
which translates into their connection
with a chosen sexual partner,

10:16.165 --> 10:17.325
or, indeed, partners.

10:18.645 --> 10:19.965
-What?
-Well,

10:20.045 --> 10:23.685
did you know that humans are not
the only species to perform fellatio?

10:23.765 --> 10:26.325
-Bats have been know to partake--
-What do bats have to do with this?

10:26.405 --> 10:29.085
Well, at the zoo,
I once saw a chinchilla fellate itself...

10:35.245 --> 10:36.165
[deep voice] Hello?

10:37.125 --> 10:38.005
Oi, you forgot to pay.

10:38.085 --> 10:40.805
I am not paying for that psycho in there
to take the piss.

10:41.045 --> 10:42.965
I don't know why I trusted you
in the first place.

10:43.325 --> 10:44.845
-Uh--
-Oh!

10:44.925 --> 10:46.725
-You owe me.
-Whatever, slag.

10:46.805 --> 10:48.885
-[Eric gasps]
-What the hell did you do?

10:48.965 --> 10:49.805
Um...

10:50.685 --> 10:53.125
I might have said something
about chinchillas giving blow jobs.
