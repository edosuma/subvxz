Previously on <i>The Secret Life</i>
<i>of the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.983 --> 00:04.417
What are you doing here?

00:04.451 --> 00:05.518
I decided to come
back to school.

00:05.553 --> 00:07.453
I've left.
I'm not letting you go.

00:07.488 --> 00:09.823
You are not going to take another
drink again anytime soon.

00:09.857 --> 00:12.525
Unless you let me come home,
that might be what I have to do.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.827
I can talk to him
if y want.

00:13.861 --> 00:15.728
About the dangers
of alcohol.

00:15.763 --> 00:17.497
I'm not gonna do
anything with you.

00:17.531 --> 00:20.500
You can if you want
to get into school here.

00:20.534 --> 00:22.802
And it's none of your business
if I have another baby.

00:22.837 --> 00:24.737
Well, I wish that you
had never told me that.

00:24.772 --> 00:27.740
I know you won't
tell Ben or anyone else.

00:27.775 --> 00:30.777
You are the photo
on Tom Bowman's desk.

00:30.811 --> 00:32.812
Oh, God.
You're Milton, aren't you?

00:32.847 --> 00:35.715
Daniel. Grace is upstairs.
She is on restriction.

00:35.749 --> 00:37.784
Well, I think I just saw Grace
sneak behind your back.

00:37.818 --> 00:39.619
<i>I saw</i>
<i>Daniel go in the house.</i>

00:39.653 --> 00:41.688
Go down there and quietly
tell him I'm waiting for him.

00:42.823 --> 00:44.390
I don't think so.

00:44.425 --> 00:45.859
I did talk
to Admissions

00:45.893 --> 00:48.494
<i>and unfortunately they're
not going to accept you.</i>

00:48.529 --> 00:50.530
She said you tried
to have sex with her.

00:51.799 --> 00:52.866
Ricky!

00:52.900 --> 00:54.634
I thought about
all we've been through

00:54.668 --> 00:56.769
and I want
to part friends.

00:56.804 --> 00:58.605
Maybe, we can wait
until the end of summer.

00:58.639 --> 00:59.806
Yes!

01:04.778 --> 01:06.713
You have a nice walk?
Yeah, it's nice out today.

01:06.747 --> 01:08.548
I think I may take Robie
and go down to the pool.

01:08.582 --> 01:09.682
What, you're not going
to take him to daycare?

01:09.717 --> 01:11.451
I am daycare.

01:12.620 --> 01:13.820
You know we can't
keep on doing this.

01:13.854 --> 01:16.422
What's wrong?
Ready for me to go home?

01:16.457 --> 01:18.791
No. Not really.

01:18.826 --> 01:20.827
I just think it's kind of

01:20.861 --> 01:23.630
unusual for us to be enjoying
life this much. That's all.

01:23.664 --> 01:26.633
Yeah, it is. I don't really
remember when we were this happy.

01:26.667 --> 01:30.403
When the girls were babies,
we were this happy, I think.

01:30.437 --> 01:32.605
Yeah. I like babies.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.540
They can't talk,
they don't have opinions,

01:34.575 --> 01:37.777
they think parents are like magic or
something, the way they look at you.

01:37.811 --> 01:39.646
Remember when Ashley and Amy
used to look at us like that?

01:39.680 --> 01:42.682
Yeah, I do.
But...

01:42.716 --> 01:44.584
But Robie's going to
grow up and find out

01:44.618 --> 01:45.652
we don't know
what we're doing either

01:45.686 --> 01:47.654
and then poof!
The magic is gone.

01:47.688 --> 01:49.622
Luckily, he's a little more
easygoing than the girls.

01:49.657 --> 01:50.823
He takes after me in that
regard, don't you think?

01:50.858 --> 01:52.692
I think that's
a recessive gene,

01:52.726 --> 01:54.694
so I don't think
it's either one of us.

01:54.728 --> 01:56.663
You're probably right.
But I have mellowed a lot, haven't I?

01:56.697 --> 01:57.830
Well, we'll see
when Ashley calls.

01:57.865 --> 02:00.600
She better call.
Unless she's too busy working.

02:00.634 --> 02:01.734
Working? Where?

02:01.769 --> 02:04.370
Somewhere. She better
be working somewhere.

02:09.376 --> 02:12.445
Come on, Ashley. You've got
to put a little flair into it.

02:12.479 --> 02:15.515
See? See, it catches
people's attention.

02:15.549 --> 02:17.717
You're gonna cause an
accident if you do that.

02:17.751 --> 02:19.519
People should
concentrate on driving,

02:19.553 --> 02:22.422
not looking
at your stupid sign.

02:22.456 --> 02:25.358
If we're going to do this, we might
as well do the best job we can.

02:25.392 --> 02:27.794
I mean, how many people
can say they've done this?

02:27.828 --> 02:29.462
I don't think
I'd admit to it.

02:29.496 --> 02:30.596
Not every job
is going to be great.

02:30.631 --> 02:31.664
And what would
you rate this one?

02:33.367 --> 02:34.634
I think it's great.

02:34.668 --> 02:37.570
We get to hang out, get a little
sun, get a little exercise

02:37.604 --> 02:38.738
and we get paid for it.

02:38.772 --> 02:41.674
In cash.
I'd give it an eight.

02:41.709 --> 02:44.377
I don't want sun.
Or exercise.

02:44.411 --> 02:46.479
You want the cash?
Yeah.

02:46.513 --> 02:47.580
Then work for it.

02:53.754 --> 02:55.488
I told you
I'd help you with that.

02:55.522 --> 02:57.457
I can do it.
I can do it.

03:04.531 --> 03:05.565
I want to know where you
went the other night.

03:05.599 --> 03:07.333
Why can't you
just leave that alone?

03:07.368 --> 03:08.701
Because I can't.
You're going to have to.

03:08.736 --> 03:10.770
No, I don't have to.
And I'm not going to.

03:10.804 --> 03:13.406
All right,
all right, sit down.

03:16.377 --> 03:18.478
You remember Toby's stepsister?
The one that...

03:18.512 --> 03:20.413
That you slept with?
Yes, I remember her.

03:20.447 --> 03:22.782
That was a long time ago, and I didn't
sleep with her the second time.

03:22.816 --> 03:25.351
I came and picked you up and
we went to the golf course.

03:25.386 --> 03:27.520
I remember that, too. You went
to see her? That's where you were?

03:27.554 --> 03:29.489
No. I didn't go see her.
I wanted to go see her.

03:29.523 --> 03:31.324
I wanted to go punch her.
For what?

03:31.358 --> 03:32.592
She's the
admissions counselor.

03:32.626 --> 03:34.560
That's who
my interview was with.

03:34.595 --> 03:37.530
She changed jobs, she saw my
application, she called me in,

03:37.564 --> 03:39.365
but not for
a real interview.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.734
She just wanted
to get together.

03:41.769 --> 03:43.703
What?

03:43.737 --> 03:45.571
Then she told our school counselor
that I tried to sleep with her

03:45.606 --> 03:47.540
and that's why she wasn't going
to let me go to school there.

03:47.574 --> 03:49.809
I'm going to punch her.
No one is gonna punch anyone.

03:49.843 --> 03:51.411
We're just going
to leave it alone.

03:51.445 --> 03:52.678
Wait, then where
did you go that night?

03:52.713 --> 03:55.515
I just went for a walk.
I just walked it off.

03:55.549 --> 03:57.717
I didn't go anywhere. I just didn't
want to tell you about this.

03:57.751 --> 03:59.352
Because?

03:59.386 --> 04:00.553
Because I know
you won't leave it alone.

04:00.587 --> 04:02.321
It's not fair.
She's lying.

04:02.356 --> 04:03.356
Leave it alone.

04:04.591 --> 04:05.591
Leave it.

04:29.608 --> 04:31.769
I feel a little funny
talking to you about this.

04:31.909 --> 04:33.743
Why? Because
I'm not his wife?

04:33.777 --> 04:36.813
Because you're not Ricky. And he
hasn't said a word to me about this.

04:36.847 --> 04:39.649
So you think because he
didn't deny it, it's true?

04:39.683 --> 04:40.950
Um, well...

04:40.985 --> 04:43.052
I know Ricky, and he did not
try to sleep with this woman.

04:44.722 --> 04:46.856
She's a skank.
A straight-up skank.

04:46.891 --> 04:48.825
She should not be working
in that kind of a job,

04:48.859 --> 04:50.927
where she can
ask for favors.

04:50.961 --> 04:53.596
You know, she asked him
if he would sleep with her,

04:53.631 --> 04:56.799
and then when he wouldn't, she made
up that lame story that she told you.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.768
Or... Or Ricky made
up a lame story? No.

04:58.802 --> 05:00.737
He would tell me if
he did something stupid.

05:00.771 --> 05:02.872
I just think this is a conversation
I should have with Ricky.

05:02.907 --> 05:05.742
If Ricky wants me to do something about
it then he should come and see me.

05:05.776 --> 05:07.677
He's not going to
come and see you.

05:07.711 --> 05:10.647
He knows you think he tried
to sleep with this Karlee.

05:10.681 --> 05:14.751
What kind of name is that?
Karlee with two "E's"?

05:14.785 --> 05:16.019
I'll tell you what
kind of name it is.

05:16.053 --> 05:17.820
A skank name.

05:17.855 --> 05:21.591
Okay, Amy, I know you're upset,
but this is a personal matter,

05:21.625 --> 05:22.926
and I just don't think
I should get involved

05:22.960 --> 05:25.662
unless Ricky comes into my office
and makes it a school matter.

05:25.696 --> 05:27.830
Fine.
Thanks for your help.

05:41.779 --> 05:43.846
Good morning, Ben.
Oh.

05:43.881 --> 05:46.649
Hi, Grace.
Surprised you're speaking to me.

05:46.684 --> 05:48.584
Why wouldn't I be
speaking to you?

05:48.619 --> 05:52.722
Look, I know that Adrian told
you that we're living together.

05:52.756 --> 05:54.657
As roommates.
Yes, she told me.

05:54.692 --> 05:56.592
That's the best
I can do right now.

05:56.627 --> 05:58.594
And that's the best
you should do.

05:58.629 --> 05:59.662
For right now, I mean.

05:59.697 --> 06:00.997
Oh. Okay.

06:01.031 --> 06:03.566
I thought you
might have some

06:03.600 --> 06:05.868
judgment about my not
acting like a husband.

06:05.903 --> 06:09.739
No. I don't. I think you definitely
shouldn't act like a husband.

06:09.773 --> 06:13.876
In that husband way that husbands do.
Just stay on the couch.

06:13.911 --> 06:16.012
I got the other room set up.
I have my own room now.

06:16.046 --> 06:17.890
If I'm going to stay
a few more months,

06:17.915 --> 06:19.582
through summer,
then I want to be comfortable.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.985
Not too comfortable.
Too comfortable how?

06:22.019 --> 06:23.886
Just don't
have sex right now.

06:23.921 --> 06:25.989
I think that would be
a bad, bad idea.

06:28.058 --> 06:29.625
Okay, I might
as well just tell you.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.561
Yes, tell me.

06:31.595 --> 06:32.996
Oh, there she is!
Hi, Adrian!

06:33.797 --> 06:35.798
Hi, Grace. Hi, Ben.

06:35.833 --> 06:36.899
Hi.

06:39.670 --> 06:41.571
Okay, what's going on?

06:41.605 --> 06:43.006
Something's going on.
You both look funny.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.074
We both are funny.
See you later.

06:50.047 --> 06:51.781
What did she
say to you?

06:51.815 --> 06:54.951
Nothing. It seemed as if she
wanted to, but she didn't,

06:54.985 --> 06:57.887
other than she doesn't think we
should be having sex right now.

06:59.656 --> 07:00.690
Oh.

07:01.025 --> 07:02.558
Oh, I get it.

07:03.027 --> 07:04.694
You do?

07:04.728 --> 07:06.929
I don't believe it.
Don't believe what?

07:07.831 --> 07:08.898
You're seeing someone?

07:12.770 --> 07:14.704
You're seeing someone!

07:14.738 --> 07:17.006
Well, we're living together
as friends. We're just friends.

07:17.041 --> 07:19.575
And as your friend, I'm
pretending to be your husband.

07:19.610 --> 07:20.843
Which I am.
We're married.

07:20.878 --> 07:22.945
Yeah. But we both know you don't
want to be married to me.

07:22.980 --> 07:24.747
That's beside the point.
Is it?

07:24.782 --> 07:26.916
Yes. It is.
I don't think it is.

07:26.950 --> 07:29.786
And I mean, at this point we're
just pretending to be married,

07:29.820 --> 07:32.855
so I guess we can both do
whatever we want to do.

07:34.658 --> 07:36.025
I gotta get to class.

07:36.727 --> 07:37.727
Adrian!

07:40.697 --> 07:42.832
Trouble in paradise?
Paradise?

07:42.866 --> 07:44.767
Well, I mean,
you two are married.

07:44.802 --> 07:46.702
I was just referring to the
fact that you two are married.

07:46.737 --> 07:47.837
What about
just a "hello?"

07:47.871 --> 07:49.572
Sure. Hello.

07:49.606 --> 07:50.840
Wait. Wait. Wait.
You know, too,

07:50.874 --> 07:52.608
don't you?
I know what?

07:52.643 --> 07:54.577
You know whatever Grace was
trying to tell me, don't you?

07:54.611 --> 07:56.946
I doubt it.
She doesn't talk to me that much,

07:56.980 --> 07:58.748
and right now, she's not
really speaking to me.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.616
See, I played
a little practical...

08:00.651 --> 08:01.984
Did Grace say anything to you
about Adrian seeing anyone?

08:02.019 --> 08:03.853
Like a psychiatrist
or something?

08:03.887 --> 08:06.956
No, not like a
psychiatrist, like a guy.

08:06.990 --> 08:09.625
What kind of guy?
A guy kind a guy.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.861
A gay guy?
A boyfriend!

08:11.895 --> 08:13.563
Whoa! Dude!
That's insane!

08:13.597 --> 08:15.898
Yeah. You know what?
It is insane.

08:15.933 --> 08:17.867
I'm going to have
to go find Grace.

09:12.856 --> 09:13.956
What did you say to Ben?

09:13.991 --> 09:16.626
There you are.
I was looking everywhere for you.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.561
Hmm. I have
a feeling you weren't.

09:19.696 --> 09:21.731
No, no, I was.
I, um...

09:21.765 --> 09:24.700
I wanted to tell you that I didn't
say anything about anything to him.

09:24.902 --> 09:26.736
Oh, no?

09:26.770 --> 09:29.539
I wanted to,
but I didn't.

09:29.573 --> 09:32.808
You know, I'm practicing
doctor-patient confidentiality.

09:32.843 --> 09:34.810
Uh-huh. Yeah,
it's not easy.

09:34.845 --> 09:35.912
You told him
not to have sex with me.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.747
Okay. But I did
not tell him why.

09:37.781 --> 09:38.814
And you're not
gonna tell him why.

09:38.849 --> 09:40.650
No. I'm not.
You better not.

09:40.684 --> 09:41.817
I'm not.

09:43.921 --> 09:46.656
You're sure there's nothing you
want to tell me? I'm sure.

09:46.690 --> 09:48.591
You don't want to talk
about your feelings about

09:48.625 --> 09:49.792
not getting
accepted last week?

09:49.826 --> 09:52.962
No. And I don't have
any feelings about it.

09:52.996 --> 09:55.698
I didn't get in.
That's that. End of story.

09:56.967 --> 09:58.668
You know, I doubt
her story is true.

09:58.702 --> 10:00.703
She's got the power.
That's how it is.

10:00.737 --> 10:02.672
But if she's
misusing her power...

10:02.706 --> 10:05.575
Then what?
I can sue her?

10:05.609 --> 10:07.577
We can all
go into court,

10:07.611 --> 10:08.945
and I can list all the women
I've slept with, including her,

10:08.979 --> 10:10.947
and then a jury will believe that
I didn't try to sleep with her?

10:10.981 --> 10:12.582
No, thank you.

10:12.616 --> 10:14.050
But that's where
you want to go to school.

10:14.084 --> 10:17.587
I don't always get what I want.
That's okay. It happens.

10:17.621 --> 10:18.921
I'll go to one of the
other schools I got into.

10:18.956 --> 10:21.624
But with all those other schools,
you'd have to commute.

10:21.658 --> 10:22.959
You'd be driving
hours a day

10:22.993 --> 10:24.627
or you'd have to
live on campus

10:24.661 --> 10:26.062
during the week and just
go home on the weekends.

10:26.096 --> 10:29.799
So? I'm going to do whatever I have
to do to get a college degree,

10:29.833 --> 10:31.734
but I don't have to ever
see that woman again

10:31.768 --> 10:33.603
and I do not want to
go to school there now.

10:33.637 --> 10:34.870
Are you sure?

10:34.905 --> 10:36.072
Because you should
fight for what's right.

10:36.106 --> 10:38.007
It doesn't mean
I'd get what's right.

10:38.041 --> 10:39.809
If you fight for something, it
doesn't mean you're gonna win.

10:39.843 --> 10:42.778
But you might.
I just want to help you.

10:42.813 --> 10:44.680
No. Please.
Do not help me.

10:44.715 --> 10:47.783
Just don't harm me.
That's all I'm asking for.

10:47.818 --> 10:49.018
Remain harmless.
Stay out of this

10:49.052 --> 10:50.987
and stay out of
my personal life.

10:53.890 --> 10:55.758
I appreciate that
you encouraged me

10:55.792 --> 10:57.793
to apply to school
in the first place,

10:57.828 --> 10:59.729
but now that I've gotten in
and I have some choices,

10:59.763 --> 11:01.998
that's as much
as I need you to do.

11:02.032 --> 11:03.032
So forget
about this one.

11:05.035 --> 11:07.003
Oh, no.

11:07.037 --> 11:08.971
Amy didn't come to see
you about this, did she?

11:09.940 --> 11:12.775
Who?
Amy Juergens.

11:12.809 --> 11:13.976
Oh, you know
who I'm talking about

11:14.011 --> 11:15.945
and now I know
she came to see you.

11:20.817 --> 11:22.718
I just don't
think it's fair.

11:22.753 --> 11:25.921
Uh, I don't think you should
be telling anyone this.

11:25.956 --> 11:28.858
Given Ricky's past, people might
be prone to think he's lying.

11:28.892 --> 11:30.760
Do you think he's lying?
Oh, no.

11:30.794 --> 11:32.962
No, I don't think so.

11:32.996 --> 11:36.799
But there is, say, a two percent
chance that he could be lying,

11:36.833 --> 11:38.868
and you don't want anyone
to know the story anyways

11:38.902 --> 11:40.803
because it's just another
woman he's slept with.

11:40.837 --> 11:42.071
Well, a long time ago.

11:42.105 --> 11:43.973
He hasn't slept with any women
since he slept with me.

11:45.909 --> 11:46.942
Hi, Ricky.

11:49.813 --> 11:54.016
Amy and I were just rehearsing
for a play that she's in.

11:55.719 --> 11:56.819
Good job, Amy.

11:59.656 --> 12:00.923
Is the play about
my being accused

12:00.957 --> 12:03.626
of sleeping with someone
in admissions at a college?

12:03.660 --> 12:04.727
She's my best friend.

12:04.761 --> 12:05.961
Is the counselor
your best friend, too?

12:05.996 --> 12:07.730
What counselor?

12:07.764 --> 12:09.532
The school counselor?

12:09.566 --> 12:10.833
Ricky, you have to
get into that school!

12:10.867 --> 12:12.668
Amy, I don't have to
get into that school

12:12.703 --> 12:13.869
and I don't want
to get into that school.

12:13.904 --> 12:15.938
So I'm asking you again
to just leave it alone.

12:15.972 --> 12:17.039
Just leave it alone.

12:18.675 --> 12:19.775
Amy.

12:19.810 --> 12:20.943
I'll try.

12:22.679 --> 12:23.913
Ricky, if someone did
something like that to me

12:23.947 --> 12:25.581
you would do
something about it.

12:25.615 --> 12:26.916
I'm just trying to do
what I think is right.

12:26.950 --> 12:30.019
I'm a man. I do not need my
girlfriend to come to my rescue.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.822
I don't need anyone to come to my rescue.
All right, Amy?

12:34.825 --> 12:35.991
All right?

12:37.894 --> 12:39.829
All right.

12:39.863 --> 12:41.664
What are you doing?
Oh, nothing.

12:41.698 --> 12:43.933
You're not crossing your fingers
behind your back, are you?

12:43.967 --> 12:45.000
Mmm-mmm.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.902
What are you,
eight years old?

12:49.606 --> 12:53.042
You're cute when you're all wound
up like this, you know that?

12:56.880 --> 12:59.682
I'll show you cute.

13:07.539 --> 13:09.909
Hey, Tommy boy,
it's almost the weekend.

13:10.138 --> 13:11.438
I thought it was Thursday.

13:13.041 --> 13:16.276
Hey, wow, look at that photo.
Is that your girl?

13:18.279 --> 13:20.180
I know you met her.

13:20.215 --> 13:21.448
She told me
all about it.

13:21.483 --> 13:24.151
And?

13:24.185 --> 13:26.053
And if you want
to go out with her,

13:26.087 --> 13:29.022
you'll have
to be a lot nicer.

13:29.057 --> 13:31.191
You're not
that good with women.

13:31.226 --> 13:36.096
I know. I've always been a player, Tom.
What can I say?

13:36.130 --> 13:39.299
But Rachel, she is a
really, really nice woman.

13:39.334 --> 13:43.470
I know that.
The children are nice, too.

13:43.505 --> 13:47.174
Annoying, but nice.

13:47.208 --> 13:52.246
I'm not ready for a wife
or two children. Are you?

13:52.280 --> 13:54.181
I just might be.

13:54.215 --> 13:58.151
Listen, I would love to
meet Bonnie and Ronnie.

13:58.186 --> 14:00.454
Do you think that I could
maybe drop by this weekend?

14:00.488 --> 14:02.222
I don't know.

14:02.257 --> 14:05.359
Let me ask my mom
if you can come over.

14:05.393 --> 14:08.462
Your mom?
It's her house.

14:08.496 --> 14:12.399
By the way,
if the kids don't like you

14:12.433 --> 14:15.469
or they're
uncomfortable with you,

14:17.038 --> 14:18.338
you are out.

14:27.282 --> 14:29.016
Hey! What are
you doing here?

14:29.050 --> 14:30.484
I'm waiting for you.

14:33.054 --> 14:34.187
Who asked you
to do that?

14:34.222 --> 14:37.024
No one asked me to.
I just wanted to see you.

14:37.058 --> 14:38.358
I'm still on restriction.

14:38.393 --> 14:40.327
No, you're not.
How do you know?

14:40.361 --> 14:42.362
My mother told you?
Yeah, your mother told me.

14:42.397 --> 14:45.032
You were off restriction while
you were sitting in my car.

14:45.066 --> 14:47.100
Why did you let me stay out there
so long till I fell asleep?

14:47.135 --> 14:49.102
No one asked you
to go out to my car,

14:49.137 --> 14:50.270
and by sneaking
out like that,

14:50.305 --> 14:52.139
you put me on the spot
with your mom.

14:52.173 --> 14:55.042
I figured it was better to side
with her than you at the time.

14:55.076 --> 14:57.444
You know, I don't have to
deal with moms at school.

14:57.478 --> 14:59.313
I have in the past,
but that's one of the things

14:59.347 --> 15:01.315
that you don't have to do
when you go off to college,

15:01.349 --> 15:03.283
deal with moms
and dads and all that.

15:03.318 --> 15:05.152
I know that.
So, then...

15:05.186 --> 15:07.354
Make it easier
for me, then, huh?

15:07.388 --> 15:09.089
I've gotta study tonight.

15:09.123 --> 15:11.224
You think we could study
at my place together?

15:11.259 --> 15:13.427
Really? Did you ask my
mom if we can do that?

15:13.461 --> 15:16.129
You have to be home by 9:00
because it's a school night.

15:16.164 --> 15:17.297
I'll have you home
by nine.

15:17.332 --> 15:19.032
Are we really
gonna study?

15:19.067 --> 15:23.136
I think we should, at least
for part of the time.

15:23.171 --> 15:24.204
Okay. Let me just
go upstairs and change.

15:24.238 --> 15:26.106
You're fine like that.

15:26.140 --> 15:27.441
Oh, this is totally
high school.

15:27.475 --> 15:29.276
If I'm going over
to your apartment,

15:29.310 --> 15:32.379
I'd like to look more like a woman.
I'll be right back.

15:34.248 --> 15:35.282
Okay.

15:48.463 --> 15:50.163
Ben?
I only have a second.

15:50.198 --> 15:53.166
Bunny doesn't let us make
personal calls at work.

15:53.201 --> 15:55.135
Is Adrian seeing someone?

15:55.169 --> 15:56.370
Is that why you said I
shouldn't have sex with her?

15:56.404 --> 15:58.071
No. She's not
seeing anyone.

15:58.106 --> 15:59.473
And you should just
stay away from her.

15:59.507 --> 16:02.009
I can't talk to you about this
right now. I can't. I have to go.

16:02.043 --> 16:03.143
Just don't be stupid.

16:03.177 --> 16:04.277
<i>And by that, you mean...</i>

16:07.115 --> 16:08.215
What?

16:09.384 --> 16:11.385
Let's get out of here.

16:11.419 --> 16:14.421
Oh, you go ahead.
I'm meeting someone for dinner.

16:14.455 --> 16:18.258
Oh? Ollie?
Ollie back in the picture?

16:18.292 --> 16:20.427
No, it's not Ollie.

16:20.461 --> 16:23.063
All right, well,
enjoy your dinner.

16:23.097 --> 16:24.164
Okay, thanks.

16:26.334 --> 16:27.334
Bye.

16:29.504 --> 16:32.005
All right, all right,
I'm having dinner with Ben.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.273
Ben asked you to
have dinner with him?

16:33.307 --> 16:36.143
I asked him to
have dinner with me.

16:36.177 --> 16:37.377
So you could talk
to him about drinking?

16:37.412 --> 16:39.246
I thought it might come up.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.348
All right, go ahead.
I talked to him about it.

16:41.382 --> 16:43.316
He said it wouldn't
happen again,

16:43.351 --> 16:46.219
and I don't think
it will happen again.

16:46.254 --> 16:49.189
So go ahead.
Have dinner with him.

16:49.223 --> 16:53.126
It seems as if he's back home, he's
sober and everything's going well,

16:53.161 --> 16:55.195
but if you want to talk
to him, talk to him.

16:55.229 --> 16:58.098
Thanks, Leo.
Good night and good luck.

17:05.205 --> 17:07.140
She's not seeing me,
if that's what you mean.

17:07.175 --> 17:08.974
That's what I mean.
No.

17:09.010 --> 17:10.343
All right, well...

17:10.377 --> 17:13.213
I can't imagine she'd
be seeing someone new,

17:13.247 --> 17:14.414
but maybe
she met someone.

17:14.449 --> 17:16.415
Although, I don't know how.
She hardly leaves the house.

17:16.451 --> 17:18.117
Except to walk.

17:18.152 --> 17:20.087
Maybe when she was
on one of her walks.

17:20.121 --> 17:21.354
She's been
walking a lot.

17:21.388 --> 17:22.989
Where did you get
this crazy idea?

17:23.023 --> 17:25.092
I don't want to say.
And, oh!

17:25.126 --> 17:27.060
Just so you know, I'm seeing
your mother for dinner.

17:27.095 --> 17:29.062
Why? Why does everyone
want to talk to my mother?

17:29.097 --> 17:31.031
Not that mother.
The other mother.

17:31.065 --> 17:33.033
And I just need
someone to talk to.

17:33.067 --> 17:35.168
About Adrian?
Adrian isn't seeing anyone.

17:35.203 --> 17:37.237
You don't know that.
And I don't know that.

17:37.271 --> 17:39.039
And I just need
someone to talk to.

17:39.073 --> 17:40.474
You have friends.
You have a family.

17:40.508 --> 17:43.176
Your mother is my friend,
or she wants to be.

17:43.211 --> 17:45.011
Why does she want
to be your friend?

17:45.046 --> 17:47.114
I don't know. She just called me
and said, "Let's have dinner.

17:47.148 --> 17:49.416
"We should be friends."
And right now, I need a friend.

17:49.450 --> 17:51.084
I'm your friend.
Not really.

17:51.119 --> 17:54.054
I am!
No, you're not.

17:54.088 --> 17:57.224
Are you two arguing about
whether or not you're friends?

17:57.258 --> 17:59.192
That should
tell you something.

17:59.227 --> 18:02.129
He's going out with my mother tonight.
With Nora.

18:02.163 --> 18:03.296
Aren't you still
married to Adrian?

18:03.331 --> 18:06.066
Not on a date.
Not on a date.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.135
She just wants to be friends.
I need a friend.

18:08.169 --> 18:11.404
I think "friend" might be
the key word there.

18:11.439 --> 18:15.375
All right. Let's get out of here.
It's closing time.

18:15.409 --> 18:19.980
Did you not drink
and pass out in public?

18:21.015 --> 18:23.984
Is she not
a friend of Bill's?

18:24.418 --> 18:25.418
Have a nice time.

18:28.156 --> 18:29.956
Who?

18:29.991 --> 18:31.324
Enjoy your dinner.
Wait.

18:31.359 --> 18:33.393
Bill. Is that who
Adrian is seeing?

18:34.362 --> 18:36.396
I can guarantee you it is not.

18:45.006 --> 18:47.174
Come on, John,
we have to hurry, okay?

18:47.208 --> 18:50.076
We have to run,
run, run, run. Okay?

18:58.186 --> 19:01.021
Hey. Hey.
John, run.

19:01.055 --> 19:02.923
Karlee?

19:02.957 --> 19:05.292
Aren't you
Karlee Carmichael?

19:05.326 --> 19:08.261
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Are you a student here?

19:08.296 --> 19:11.932
You know me, all right.
I'm Amy Juergens.

19:11.966 --> 19:13.366
This is my son, John.

19:13.401 --> 19:16.236
He's also
Ricky Underwood's son.

19:16.270 --> 19:18.972
Who? Oh, you know who.
You slept with him.

19:19.006 --> 19:21.975
Who I sleep with is
none of your business.

19:22.009 --> 19:23.944
Now get away from me or
I'm going to call security.

19:23.978 --> 19:27.180
Oh, go ahead. Call security.
What do I care?

19:27.215 --> 19:29.316
You're the one who's
going to get in trouble.

19:29.350 --> 19:31.184
I hope you lose
your job, Karlee.

19:31.219 --> 19:34.087
In fact, I'm going to try to see
to it that you lose your job.

19:35.423 --> 19:37.023
And how are you
gonna do that?

19:37.058 --> 19:40.227
By telling everyone that you
tried to sleep with Ricky

19:40.261 --> 19:41.428
and when he
wasn't interested,

19:41.462 --> 19:43.997
you wouldn't let
him into this school.

19:44.031 --> 19:45.265
He deserves to be
at this school.

19:45.299 --> 19:48.134
Look, Amy, I don't know
what Ricky told you

19:48.169 --> 19:50.103
but he did try
to sleep with me.

19:50.137 --> 19:52.038
He's slept with me
before, you know.

19:52.073 --> 19:54.441
Oh, I know. Doesn't mean he'd
ever sleep with you again.

19:54.475 --> 19:57.010
He would
if I said yes.

19:57.044 --> 19:58.178
He has a problem, you know.

19:58.212 --> 20:00.981
He's done something
about his problem.

20:01.015 --> 20:03.350
You're the one
with the problem.

20:03.384 --> 20:06.219
Don't forget I know
people who know you.

20:09.390 --> 20:12.325
Look.
We have a son.

20:12.360 --> 20:16.129
Okay?
This is our son.

20:16.163 --> 20:17.846
How can you do
this to a guy

20:17.871 --> 20:19.920
who's trying to do the
best he can for his son?

20:22.036 --> 20:23.036
Come on, John.

20:39.616 --> 20:40.998
He was really tired tonight.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.387
Huh?
Yeah.

20:44.389 --> 20:47.091
Busy day at the nursery?

20:47.125 --> 20:48.392
Yeah.

20:50.061 --> 20:51.929
Is everything okay?

20:51.963 --> 20:54.131
Yeah, everything's fine.
Why?

20:54.166 --> 20:55.366
Are you upset with me?

20:56.268 --> 20:58.202
For calling me cute?

20:59.004 --> 21:00.037
No.

21:01.106 --> 21:02.239
It was kind of
condescending,

21:02.274 --> 21:04.074
but I'm sure you didn't
mean it that way.

21:04.109 --> 21:07.344
No, I didn't. I just meant you
were cute. Coming to my defense.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.381
All right,
not cute, more...

21:11.983 --> 21:13.117
I don't know.

21:13.151 --> 21:15.319
I never really had
someone on my side, I guess.

21:15.353 --> 21:17.087
So thanks.

21:19.224 --> 21:21.158
You're welcome.
Oh, come on.

21:21.193 --> 21:23.093
You can't really be upset that
I called you cute, can you?

21:23.128 --> 21:25.930
I said that I wasn't.
Won't ever happen again.

21:25.964 --> 21:28.332
No, I hope not.

21:28.366 --> 21:31.168
I just don't understand why you
won't stand up for yourself.

21:31.203 --> 21:32.336
Because what good
is it going to do?

21:32.370 --> 21:34.171
You have to choose
your battles in life

21:34.206 --> 21:37.041
and this is not a battle I'm choosing.
It's not worth the fight.

21:37.075 --> 21:38.309
Do you want to
go away to school?

21:38.343 --> 21:40.978
I don't want to,
but I might have to,

21:41.012 --> 21:42.913
or I might have to wait another
year and go when you go.

21:42.948 --> 21:45.149
Ricky, if you do that, then you
might not get in next year.

21:45.183 --> 21:47.918
I didn't get in this year. But it's
okay. I can drive back and forth.

21:47.953 --> 21:50.154
No, it's too hard
driving back and forth

21:50.188 --> 21:54.091
and working and taking care of me
and John and going to college.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.927
We'll figure it out. We don't
have to figure it out tonight.

21:56.962 --> 21:59.196
I just wish...
Don't wish.

21:59.231 --> 22:01.966
Wishing is just wanting something
not to be the way it is.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.234
his is the way it is.
Well...

22:03.268 --> 22:05.069
Well, I want to
leave trouble alone.

22:05.103 --> 22:08.138
And more than that, I want
you to leave trouble alone.

22:13.211 --> 22:16.046
It's just that alcohol isn't
the answer to your problems.

22:16.081 --> 22:17.948
It's not the answer
to anyone's problems.

22:17.983 --> 22:19.950
It was never the
answer to my problems

22:19.985 --> 22:22.920
and then it became my problem
and I gotta say, Ben,

22:22.954 --> 22:25.189
you scare me, because

22:25.223 --> 22:27.839
you got drunk the very
first time you drank.

22:27.864 --> 22:28.993
That's what I did.

22:28.994 --> 22:31.028
It's not the first time
I had a drink.

22:31.062 --> 22:33.898
I've had a drink before. I drank wine
the entire summer I was in Italy.

22:33.932 --> 22:37.067
And did you drink until you
got drunk there, as well?

22:37.102 --> 22:39.136
No.

22:39.170 --> 22:43.107
And, if you don't mind
my asking, who is Bill?

22:43.141 --> 22:44.174
Do you have
a friend named Bill?

22:44.209 --> 22:46.076
I do.

22:46.111 --> 22:48.045
And?
And what?

22:48.079 --> 22:49.346
And does he know Adrian?

22:50.048 --> 22:51.181
What?

22:51.216 --> 22:53.884
Adrian and I are
working on being friends.

22:53.919 --> 22:54.985
Just being friends,

22:55.020 --> 22:56.954
and I have this
sneaking suspicion

22:56.988 --> 22:59.156
that although that's
what we both agreed to,

22:59.190 --> 23:01.091
it's not what
she wanted and so...

23:08.266 --> 23:10.267
Hi, Nora.
Hi.

23:12.037 --> 23:13.103
You remember Ben?

23:13.138 --> 23:15.072
I don't think
I've met Ben,

23:16.174 --> 23:18.876
but I know that Ruben
is your father-in-law.

23:20.979 --> 23:23.147
Would you mind giving me
a few minutes with Nora

23:23.181 --> 23:24.348
while you go
talk to Ruben?

23:27.052 --> 23:28.052
Please?

23:42.968 --> 23:45.202
So?
How are things going?

23:46.338 --> 23:48.172
What's new?

23:51.209 --> 23:52.309
I miss you, Nora.

23:56.982 --> 23:59.283
I was hoping you'd
changed your mind,

24:01.219 --> 24:02.319
but I guess you haven't.

24:05.290 --> 24:06.991
I can't.

24:10.295 --> 24:14.131
Oh, I wish I could,
but I can't.

24:19.237 --> 24:20.237
Can I buy you a drink?

24:22.307 --> 24:26.010
Joking. You're underage.

24:26.044 --> 24:28.979
And, uh, I heard
what happened.

24:29.014 --> 24:30.014
How did you hear?

24:32.884 --> 24:35.219
I hope you don't
do that again,

24:35.253 --> 24:37.988
but I can understand,
I guess.

24:38.023 --> 24:40.190
You and Adrian have
been through a lot

24:40.225 --> 24:42.960
and you're still
going through a lot.

24:42.994 --> 24:44.028
Is she still
not getting out?

24:44.062 --> 24:45.896
She's getting out.
Meaning?

24:45.930 --> 24:46.964
She's back at school.

24:46.998 --> 24:48.198
Yeah, and?

24:48.233 --> 24:49.967
And nothing.

24:50.001 --> 24:51.902
You would never leave her after
everything that's happened?

24:54.072 --> 24:57.307
You would never leave her after
everything that's happened.

25:00.945 --> 25:01.945
No.

25:05.817 --> 25:08.886
I see you're out with Ollie.
Is your wife out of town?

25:08.920 --> 25:11.088
She's always out of town.
She's a flight attendant.

25:14.192 --> 25:17.861
Look. Everything you and
Adrian have been through,

25:17.896 --> 25:21.098
we've all been through,
we're all going through.

25:21.132 --> 25:24.001
So I felt like
getting out and, well,

25:24.035 --> 25:26.837
Ollie is safe
to be out with.

25:26.871 --> 25:29.006
Cindy's okay with it.

25:29.040 --> 25:33.143
You realize this has all been
very stressful for everyone,

25:33.178 --> 25:37.214
but I'm sure it's
most stressful for Adrian.

25:37.248 --> 25:39.116
So...
So I get what you're saying.

25:42.887 --> 25:44.855
Hey, I'll do that.

25:44.889 --> 25:46.190
What, did you just throw Robie
in the bed and leave him there?

25:46.224 --> 25:48.826
He's happy in there.
Moose will keep him entertained.

25:48.860 --> 25:50.828
I'll check on him.
I got the walkie-talkie.

25:50.862 --> 25:52.096
It's a baby monitor.

25:52.130 --> 25:53.230
Whatever.

25:53.264 --> 25:55.899
Look, George, I feel
like I need to say this.

25:55.934 --> 25:57.197
No, no, no, don't say it.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.865
Whatever it is you have
to say, don't say it now.

25:58.870 --> 26:01.038
It's been a perfect day, and I
just wanna have a glass of wine,

26:01.072 --> 26:02.806
a nice dinner, hang out
and watch some TV

26:02.841 --> 26:04.174
and go to bed
and not have sex.

26:04.209 --> 26:06.143
Please don't screw it up
by talking, please.

26:06.177 --> 26:08.846
Can't we just hide out here in the
planned community and be happy?

26:08.880 --> 26:12.182
I'm not hiding.
You're hiding. I live here.

26:12.217 --> 26:14.118
And I live here
because I'm single,

26:14.152 --> 26:16.086
and this is the best
place for me to be.

26:16.121 --> 26:18.021
I can watch over
my mother and our son

26:18.056 --> 26:20.224
and run my business from here.
So I'm not hiding.

26:22.193 --> 26:26.063
But if you want to just stay
and have a glass of wine

26:26.998 --> 26:28.966
and eat dinner

26:29.000 --> 26:32.035
and hang out and watch TV
and not have sex,

26:32.070 --> 26:33.937
I guess we can
do that, too.

26:33.972 --> 26:34.972
But I just don't know
for how long.

26:38.176 --> 26:39.910
Cheers.

26:46.851 --> 26:50.888
I guess I should tell you
that I went to see her.

26:50.922 --> 26:53.056
I knew that, didn't I?
You went to see the counselor.

26:54.058 --> 26:55.058
Not the counselor.

26:56.161 --> 26:57.995
What?
I couldn't help it.

26:58.029 --> 26:59.263
I just couldn't help it.

26:59.297 --> 27:01.098
You couldn't help what?
What are we talking about?

27:01.132 --> 27:02.132
Karlee.

27:06.905 --> 27:08.038
Don't forget
how cute I am.

27:29.745 --> 27:30.745
Yes!

27:46.595 --> 27:48.529
What? How'd you like
the chicken tonight?

27:48.564 --> 27:49.597
Did you like the chicken?

27:49.631 --> 27:52.467
I liked the chicken.

27:52.501 --> 27:55.636
Not as much as
Dancing with the Stars.

28:02.444 --> 28:03.511
He still didn't
say anything?

28:03.545 --> 28:05.379
Who?
Milton.

28:05.414 --> 28:08.316
I was hoping he might say
something to you about me.

28:08.350 --> 28:09.550
You really like that guy?

28:09.585 --> 28:11.519
Tom, I know
it's ridiculous

28:11.553 --> 28:13.387
that I'd be thinking
about another man

28:13.422 --> 28:16.557
while I'm living in
the guest house with

28:16.592 --> 28:20.328
the most wonderful man
in the whole world, but...

28:20.362 --> 28:24.298
But we both know

28:24.333 --> 28:26.501
we're just friends.

28:26.535 --> 28:28.603
Good friends.

28:28.637 --> 28:33.674
And I want you and
the children to be happy.

28:33.709 --> 28:37.645
I'm sorry.
I'm not ready for a family.

28:37.679 --> 28:41.549
I thought I was,
but I'm not.

28:41.583 --> 28:44.485
It's okay.
I understand.

28:44.520 --> 28:50.424
And I'm very grateful
to you, Tom. For everything.

28:50.459 --> 28:54.295
And we'll get out just as soon as
I can get my finances together.

28:54.329 --> 28:56.330
Take your time.
I'm thinking it'll take

28:56.365 --> 28:57.632
about three months.

28:58.567 --> 28:59.700
Could be longer.

28:59.735 --> 29:02.637
I'll get Milton over to meet
the children right away.

29:02.671 --> 29:04.639
So he did say something? Yes.

29:10.379 --> 29:13.681
I don't see how people
can stay married.

29:13.715 --> 29:16.417
You know?
I mean, I'd like to,

29:16.451 --> 29:19.453
but I'm afraid to make a promise
I don't think I can keep.

29:19.488 --> 29:22.356
I mean, right now,
I've promised myself

29:22.391 --> 29:24.725
to take life
one day at a time.

29:24.760 --> 29:28.496
That's a promise
I feel as if I can keep.

29:28.530 --> 29:31.332
Now, if I could, say,
be married one day at a time,

29:31.366 --> 29:33.601
then I'd do that.
But it's...

29:33.635 --> 29:36.370
It's bigger than that.
It's forever.

29:36.405 --> 29:38.406
Which is why I'm never
gonna do this again.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.674
Never, never, never.

29:39.708 --> 29:41.776
When I get out,
I'm going to stay out.

29:41.810 --> 29:43.678
I doubt I'll even
live with anyone again.

29:43.712 --> 29:45.613
Being alone
is so much easier.

29:45.647 --> 29:47.715
Yeah.

29:47.749 --> 29:50.551
I mean, things are always
going to be changing.

29:50.586 --> 29:52.720
That's life.
Things change.

29:53.655 --> 29:55.456
People change.

29:56.758 --> 29:59.427
How do you

29:59.461 --> 30:03.297
promise to be with
someone for an eternity?

30:03.332 --> 30:04.332
Get them pregnant?

30:06.602 --> 30:08.469
Sorry, it's just...

30:08.503 --> 30:11.439
It's the eternity
that sets me off.

30:11.473 --> 30:13.541
I can't stand to
think about eternity,

30:13.575 --> 30:18.346
about things going on
and on and on and on.

30:18.380 --> 30:21.582
But then again, that makes
death comforting,

30:21.617 --> 30:25.586
that maybe things don't go
on and on and on and on.

30:25.621 --> 30:28.389
The Montrachet
that you ordered?

30:28.423 --> 30:31.525
Oh, I don't think we ordered
any wine, thank you.

30:31.560 --> 30:34.395
Hey, but if fate has
intervened, I'll take it.

30:34.429 --> 30:36.597
Have you been listening
to a word I've said?

30:36.632 --> 30:39.300
Yes. Have you been listening
to a word I've said?

30:47.643 --> 30:50.678
Okay, you're not gonna touch that.
And neither am I.

30:50.712 --> 30:52.713
Because this
is not the answer.

30:52.748 --> 30:55.483
No, but it goes very well
with not having the answer.

30:57.519 --> 30:59.387
I'm an alcoholic.
I'm not.

30:59.421 --> 31:01.756
And you don't want to be.
Ben, it's hell.

31:01.790 --> 31:04.392
Being addicted
to anything is hell.

31:04.426 --> 31:05.626
So is being married.

31:08.764 --> 31:10.498
That's a very good wine.

31:10.532 --> 31:11.599
May I pour
that for you?

31:11.633 --> 31:13.768
Oh, yeah. Just a little.
I'm an alcoholic.

31:13.802 --> 31:15.703
Funny.

31:15.737 --> 31:17.371
Yeah.

31:21.543 --> 31:23.377
You're not really gonna
drink that, are you?

31:31.420 --> 31:33.354
If it teaches you
a lesson, yes.

31:39.628 --> 31:43.264
I'm so sorry. This is not your wine.
I had tables mixed up.

31:43.298 --> 31:44.598
It's ours now.

31:44.633 --> 31:47.301
And we're not gonna pay for it.
Your mistake.

31:47.336 --> 31:48.602
Take it away.
I'll pay for it.

31:48.637 --> 31:49.737
Over my dead body.

31:49.771 --> 31:52.640
It's a $300
bottle of wine.

31:52.674 --> 31:54.675
Why, yes it is.

32:09.691 --> 32:12.526
Daniel! Daniel!
Open up!

32:12.561 --> 32:14.261
Ignore that.

32:14.296 --> 32:16.430
Come on, Daniel!
We know you're in there.

32:16.465 --> 32:17.698
My neighbors.
I'll get rid of them.

32:17.733 --> 32:19.400
Ugh. Good.

32:26.408 --> 32:27.641
Hey. What's going on?

32:27.676 --> 32:29.443
There's some kind of
protest on north campus.

32:29.478 --> 32:30.578
And we wanna go.
Do you wanna go?

32:33.715 --> 32:36.250
Do you wanna go?

32:36.284 --> 32:39.220
Grace, this is Dawn and
Regina, my neighbors.

32:39.254 --> 32:40.621
Dawn and Regina,
this is Grace.

32:41.656 --> 32:43.290
Hi, Grace.

32:43.325 --> 32:46.427
Yeah, hi.
Haven't seen you around.

32:46.461 --> 32:48.295
Is this the girl that you...
Yes.

32:48.330 --> 32:50.531
That I met when
I was with my dad.

32:50.565 --> 32:53.434
It's nice to meet you guys.
We were just studying.

32:53.468 --> 32:54.535
Yeah, we were
just studying.

32:54.569 --> 32:55.669
And Grace has to be
home by nine

32:55.704 --> 32:57.538
so we can't go
anywhere with you.

32:57.572 --> 32:59.373
Sorry. Bye.
All right.

32:59.408 --> 33:01.275
Well, whatever.
We'll see you tomorrow.

33:01.309 --> 33:03.677
Yeah, or maybe later tonight.
Night, Grace.

33:03.712 --> 33:05.446
Nice meeting you.
Nice to meet you.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.547
Goodnight.
Nice to meet you, too.

33:09.484 --> 33:12.420
Oh, my God, I feel like such a loser.
I'm in high school.

33:12.454 --> 33:14.655
I have a 9:00 curfew
because it's a school night.

33:14.689 --> 33:16.257
And I live with my mom.

33:16.291 --> 33:17.491
And your old boyfriend.

33:17.526 --> 33:19.593
I don't know, Daniel.
Maybe this isn't gonna work.

33:19.628 --> 33:22.263
You knew that I was in college and you
knew that I had my own apartment,

33:22.297 --> 33:23.597
and you know that
there are neighbors.

33:23.632 --> 33:25.366
Neighbors that
go to school here, so...

33:25.400 --> 33:27.501
Knowing it and experiencing
it are two different things.

33:27.536 --> 33:30.471
Don't panic. We'll ease you
into college life, okay?

33:30.505 --> 33:32.339
Everything is
gonna be fine.

33:32.374 --> 33:33.674
It's the first time
you've been over here.

33:33.708 --> 33:35.443
Okay.
All right.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.548
Mmm.
Oh, wait, let me...

33:40.582 --> 33:42.516
It's 8:45.

33:42.551 --> 33:44.485
Then we can make out
for five more minutes.

33:45.487 --> 33:46.654
Okay.

33:52.260 --> 33:53.627
You know there's a three-hour
time difference, right?

33:53.662 --> 33:55.262
I know.
I'm really sorry.

33:55.297 --> 33:58.299
But it's really important.
I have to talk to you.

33:58.333 --> 34:02.236
Me? You're not calling me to get
Ashley to pick up her phone?

34:02.270 --> 34:04.238
That's what your parents do.
Your dad, anyway.

34:04.272 --> 34:05.506
No, but how is Ashley?

34:05.540 --> 34:07.308
She's exhausted.

34:07.342 --> 34:09.510
She worked almost an hour
out in the hot sun today.

34:09.543 --> 34:11.245
Doing what?
We're sign twirlers.

34:11.279 --> 34:12.513
What?
You know,

34:12.547 --> 34:14.315
we stand on the corner
twirling a big sign

34:14.349 --> 34:15.649
to point people to condos
that are for sale.

34:15.684 --> 34:19.420
Really? Ashley is twirling
a sign out in the hot sun?

34:19.454 --> 34:23.657
Uh, she didn't exactly twirl,
so we both got fired.

34:23.692 --> 34:27.261
But it's okay, we're pretty
good at finding jobs now.

34:27.295 --> 34:28.661
This week alone,
we've twirled signs,

34:28.697 --> 34:30.498
distributed flyers
and sold fruit.

34:30.532 --> 34:32.433
That's great, I guess.

34:32.467 --> 34:34.435
All right, it was nice
talking to you.

34:34.469 --> 34:37.204
No, no, no, wait. I have to ask
you about your sister, Karlee.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.607
She's not my sister.
She's my stepsister,

34:39.641 --> 34:42.476
and she's already called me
asking about you.

34:42.511 --> 34:45.545
Did you tell her that I
told you she has issues?

34:45.580 --> 34:47.414
No.

34:47.449 --> 34:49.617
She thought you knew about her, and
since you don't know about her,

34:49.650 --> 34:52.186
she's gonna file
a complaint against you,

34:52.219 --> 34:55.389
and you better watch out for
her because she's got issues.

34:55.422 --> 34:58.392
She's claiming that Ricky tried
to get her to sleep with him

34:58.426 --> 34:59.493
so that he could
get into that school.

34:59.528 --> 35:01.328
What?
She didn't tell you?

35:01.363 --> 35:05.432
No. I doubt that's true.
At least, not with Ricky.

35:05.467 --> 35:07.301
She's been in trouble
a few times before.

35:07.335 --> 35:08.398
What kind of trouble?

35:08.423 --> 35:09.436
Sleeping around with
guys kind of trouble.

35:09.437 --> 35:11.672
What guys?
All kinds of guys.

35:11.706 --> 35:15.442
Guys she works with, guys she
works for, any guy she meets.

35:15.477 --> 35:17.378
She's been in therapy
since she was 13,

35:17.412 --> 35:20.347
but you know, you have to want
the help. She doesn't want any help.

35:20.382 --> 35:22.616
She didn't sleep
with my dad, did she?

35:22.651 --> 35:23.651
I don't think so.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.390
All right. Well, thanks,
this is all very helpful.

35:29.424 --> 35:30.624
Unless she finds out
I talked to you.

35:30.659 --> 35:33.527
Then it won't be
so helpful. It'll be hurtful.

35:33.562 --> 35:34.495
For me.

35:36.231 --> 35:38.232
Thanks, Toby.
And thanks for taking care of Ashley.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.500
You're welcome.

35:39.534 --> 35:41.569
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

35:41.603 --> 35:46.307
Thanks. And good luck to you, I
mean, surviving Ashley.

35:46.341 --> 35:49.209
Thanks. Goodnight.

35:49.244 --> 35:50.411
Goodnight.

35:59.381 --> 36:00.514
Good morning.

36:00.549 --> 36:02.383
Yeah, good morning.

36:02.417 --> 36:03.584
I wanted to talk
to you last night,

36:03.619 --> 36:05.620
but you were
pretending to be asleep.

36:05.654 --> 36:06.654
Was I?

36:08.390 --> 36:09.557
You took
my son with you?

36:09.591 --> 36:12.560
You still sound upset.
How was your walk?

36:12.594 --> 36:15.696
I think I could have walked to the
moon, and I'd still be upset with you.

36:15.731 --> 36:17.565
I am upset with you.
How did this happen?

36:17.599 --> 36:19.734
I googled your friend,
I saw what she looked like,

36:19.768 --> 36:21.535
and I wanted to
see her in person.

36:21.570 --> 36:25.473
So I left the nursery early
and drove down to the school.

36:25.507 --> 36:26.741
I was walking towards
the admission office

36:26.775 --> 36:28.576
when I passed her
on the sidewalk.

36:28.610 --> 36:30.544
And then I just
lost my mind.

36:30.579 --> 36:31.712
She texted me.
She told me to keep

36:31.747 --> 36:33.648
my girlfriend and my son
away from her.

36:33.682 --> 36:35.583
She said that she's thinking about
getting a restraining order.

36:35.617 --> 36:37.618
She won't do that.
She might do that.

36:37.653 --> 36:40.688
Ricky, she won't do that, okay?
I talked to Toby.

36:40.722 --> 36:42.623
Oh, God, Amy.
What is wrong with you?

36:42.658 --> 36:44.558
Toby? Now Toby knows?

36:44.593 --> 36:46.627
Which means Ashley knows.
That means your mom is gonna know

36:46.662 --> 36:48.496
and your dad
is gonna know.

36:48.530 --> 36:49.764
And then my moms and my
dad are going to know.

36:49.798 --> 36:52.500
The whole world is going to know.
What is wrong with you?

36:53.602 --> 36:54.735
Did I not say leave it?

36:54.770 --> 36:56.737
I couldn't, okay?
I still can't.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.648
You didn't say anything
about your date last night.

37:07.683 --> 37:10.384
I was hoping you'd tell me
how it went when you got home.

37:10.419 --> 37:11.519
Mom, how good
could it be?

37:11.553 --> 37:13.654
I had a 9:00 curfew
like a big baby.

37:13.689 --> 37:16.624
Ooh, someone woke up on
the wrong side of the bed.

37:16.658 --> 37:18.392
At least it was yours.

37:19.594 --> 37:22.563
Honey, just a little joke.
Is everything okay?

37:22.597 --> 37:24.532
Oh, yeah,
everything is okay,

37:24.566 --> 37:26.434
except for the guy I love

37:26.468 --> 37:28.536
is surrounded by good-looking college
girls who can do anything they want.

37:28.570 --> 37:32.506
Well, in just over another year,
you'll be one of those girls.

37:32.541 --> 37:33.741
But right now, you're not.

37:33.775 --> 37:35.543
No, I'm not.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.681
Good morning,
beautiful lady.

37:40.716 --> 37:43.517
What do you want?

37:43.552 --> 37:46.754
Oh, it's not for me.
It's for the children.

37:46.788 --> 37:50.758
Can Milton come over

37:50.792 --> 37:54.428
for a playdate
this weekend?

37:54.463 --> 37:57.531
Milton? Your boss, Milton?
What are you talking about?

37:57.566 --> 38:00.568
He wants Rachel.

38:00.602 --> 38:04.338
Well, he can't have Rachel.
Rachel is your friend.

38:04.373 --> 38:06.507
And she and her children
are living with you.

38:06.541 --> 38:07.675
I wish they were not.

38:07.709 --> 38:10.544
Tom, we've talked
about this.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.346
You are responsible
for them.

38:12.381 --> 38:15.383
You invited them into
your life and into your home

38:15.417 --> 38:16.517
and you are responsible
for them.

38:16.551 --> 38:20.388
I don't want to be
responsible for them .

38:20.422 --> 38:23.424
I want my old life back.

38:23.458 --> 38:27.395
I'm going to let Milton

38:27.429 --> 38:29.497
go out with her.

38:29.531 --> 38:34.468
Maybe he wants to be responsible
for the three of them.

38:34.503 --> 38:36.337
Does Rachel
know about this?

38:36.371 --> 38:39.440
Yes. She met Milton.

38:39.474 --> 38:44.345
She likes Milton.
And Milton likes her.

38:44.379 --> 38:47.681
Just now, we have to make

38:47.716 --> 38:51.619
the kids like Milton.

38:52.587 --> 38:54.522
Easy.

38:54.556 --> 38:57.625
Oh, honey, it's never easy to
get out of a relationship.

39:09.504 --> 39:11.505
Ow.
You have a bedroom.

39:11.540 --> 39:13.474
This is as far
as I could get.

39:13.508 --> 39:15.476
You weren't drinking
again last night, were you?

39:15.510 --> 39:17.411
No.
You got home really late.

39:17.446 --> 39:21.315
Are you pointing that out as
my wife or as my roommate?

39:22.617 --> 39:24.385
The latter.

39:28.490 --> 39:31.459
You know, if you did get
drunk again last night,

39:31.493 --> 39:34.428
your dad is
going to kill you.

39:34.463 --> 39:36.464
I'm pretty sure he's gonna
kill me anyway.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.301
Hmm.

40:18.306 --> 40:19.306
Nora?

40:20.342 --> 40:21.675
Nora!
Mmm.

40:23.545 --> 40:25.513
Boykewich International,
how may I help you?

40:25.547 --> 40:28.415
You may help me by
telling me what this is.

40:28.450 --> 40:30.551
Let me just

40:30.585 --> 40:33.487
regroup for a moment.

40:33.522 --> 40:36.357
I'm, uh, where?

40:36.391 --> 40:38.392
In my house,
in Ben's bed.

40:38.426 --> 40:41.562
Okay, I know I didn't
sleep with Ben.

40:45.500 --> 40:49.270
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God.

40:49.304 --> 40:51.405
Oh, God.
I really screwed up.

40:51.439 --> 40:52.740
I screwed up.
I had a drink.

40:52.774 --> 40:55.442
From the looks of things, I'd
say it was more than a drink.

41:00.582 --> 41:02.383
Are you okay?

41:05.453 --> 41:06.620
It's been almost
two years.

41:08.423 --> 41:10.357
I had almost two years
without a drink.

41:10.392 --> 41:13.260
Why would I have a drink?

41:13.295 --> 41:15.529
I don't know.
Was it because Ben was drinking?

41:15.564 --> 41:18.265
No. Ben wasn't drinking.

41:21.503 --> 41:24.438
I'll have someone drive you to a meeting
and then they'll drive you home.

41:24.472 --> 41:28.475
But I have to be at work
in an hour. Don't I?

41:30.478 --> 41:31.612
Please.

41:31.646 --> 41:33.380
We'll talk.

41:34.382 --> 41:35.482
Okay.

41:56.571 --> 41:58.339
I appreciate Amy's help,

41:58.373 --> 42:00.507
but I had called the school
about this yesterday,

42:00.542 --> 42:06.447
and the Dean was well aware of Ms.
Carmichael having some issues.

42:06.481 --> 42:08.415
There have been
several complaints,

42:08.450 --> 42:10.551
one from her colleague who
has the office next to hers

42:10.585 --> 42:13.387
and can hear everything
said in her office.

42:13.421 --> 42:15.422
Ah, so I'm not
that special.

42:15.457 --> 42:17.391
No, I guess not.

42:17.425 --> 42:19.493
And they don't need to talk
to you in order to fire her.

42:19.527 --> 42:21.428
They've talked
to other applicants.

42:21.463 --> 42:22.529
She's officially terminated.

42:24.432 --> 42:27.434
And you're officially
accepted. Congratulations.

42:27.469 --> 42:29.436
And if I still don't wanna
go to school there?

42:29.471 --> 42:32.406
Are you kidding me?
After all the trouble Amy went to?

42:32.440 --> 42:35.509
I am kidding.
I couldn't help myself.

42:37.479 --> 42:40.414
It's not very often that
something good happens to me.

42:40.448 --> 42:41.448
Thanks a lot.

42:43.351 --> 42:44.418
I'll just be going now.

42:45.553 --> 42:47.321
Thank you.
