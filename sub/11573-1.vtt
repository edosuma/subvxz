WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:05.495
[SALESMAN] That's me.
Highest sales in the division.

00:05.590 --> 00:08.252
And then in the morning,
I'm flying back to Omaha.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.331
That's great.

00:09.427 --> 00:12.009
[BARBACK] Coming through behind you.

00:12.096 --> 00:15.509
--Everything good out here?
--[BO] Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm just starving.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.592
--|t's $10.50.
--Oh, right. There we go.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.598
Oh, and darlin', you keep the change.

00:21.689 --> 00:25.932
And this one's for you.

00:26.027 --> 00:30.566
Oh, thank you, but I can't. |t's policy.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.383
Excuse me, darlin'.

00:56.474 --> 01:00.808
Hello, beautiful. Pretty
drink for a pretty lady.

01:00.895 --> 01:04.934
--Sure. Cheers.
--Cheers.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.520
Well now, you are
thirsty, aren't you?

01:12.615 --> 01:14.981
Well, aren't you just
the sweetest thing?

01:15.076 --> 01:17.283
Thanks buddy, and ciao.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.701
Is that so?

01:41.811 --> 01:46.020
Aw, come on. Can't get
rid of me that easily.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.940
Any inside tips?

01:49.026 --> 01:51.859
Hey, where you heading to?
Any good parties?

01:51.946 --> 01:57.407
'Cause I got a few hours
that I would love to kill.

01:57.493 --> 01:59.449
Yeah, good luck with that.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.591
You sure are a pretty
little thing, aren't you?

02:15.678 --> 02:18.636
Gross. Back off or I'll vom.

02:22.143 --> 02:25.226
Whoa. Why am | tripping?

02:25.313 --> 02:27.053
What was in that drink?

02:27.148 --> 02:30.481
Oh, just something to make
you a little bit friendlier.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.731
We are friends, aren't we?

02:33.821 --> 02:37.063
Come on, baby. Just a little kiss.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.649
Oh, let go, creepo.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.917
You good?

02:54.008 --> 02:56.465
A-o kay.

02:56.552 --> 03:00.886
You are very naughty.

03:04.185 --> 03:07.928
Left without saying goodbye.

03:08.022 --> 03:11.856
Don't you know when a
girl's playing hard to get?

03:15.404 --> 03:16.814
What do you want?

03:16.906 --> 03:19.488
Just one little kiss.

03:32.797 --> 03:37.757
[muffled moaning]

04:00.616 --> 04:04.404
This is so going to be viral.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.748
Hey!

04:14.839 --> 04:17.376
What about me?

04:19.677 --> 04:23.169
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.381
You're pretty.

04:26.475 --> 04:30.218
I saw you eat somebody's
face. It was amazing.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.767
I'll take you somewhere safe.

04:37.862 --> 04:42.447
Bye-bye, Mr. Smiley Face.

05:01.969 --> 05:06.087
[HALE] Hey. Finally decide to show.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.764
So, what have we got here?

05:08.851 --> 05:13.094
Male, mid 30's. No ID, just
a room key for the hotel.

05:13.189 --> 05:17.478
Woman found him over an hour ago.
I'd say that's it for witnesses.

05:17.568 --> 05:18.899
Any cameras in here?

05:18.986 --> 05:21.944
Busted. Checking on the garages.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.623
Jesus. What the hell happened to him?

05:36.879 --> 05:39.245
Look, you want to give us
a little space here, Frank?

05:39.340 --> 05:42.423
Yeah, Frank, why don't you
go canvass or something?

05:42.510 --> 05:44.546
--You got it.
--Thanks, man.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.764
Vic's human.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.684
Yeah, killer definitely wasn't.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.307
Our side?

05:55.397 --> 05:57.809
I hope not.

05:57.900 --> 06:02.269
This is sloppy, leaving
a feed behind like this.

06:02.363 --> 06:06.197
I don't recognize this
kind of kill, do you?

06:06.283 --> 06:09.275
No, but it's a good way to die.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.453
Dude died with a smile on his face.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.155
[DYSON] Hair.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.916
Brunette.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.498
[HALE] Got it.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.130
What you got?

06:31.225 --> 06:32.840
He's been drinking.

06:32.935 --> 06:35.722
And | smell a human on him...

06:35.813 --> 06:37.223
Female.

06:37.314 --> 06:41.557
Well, this time of night, that combo?
My money's on the hotel bar.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.188
Uh huh.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.989
I don't know. Sounds like a guy that was
here, but it's been a crazy busy night.

06:49.076 --> 06:52.864
I can't remember them all, you know.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.037
--Liked the ladies, though.
--How's that?

06:55.124 --> 06:57.160
Kept hitting on our bartender all night.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.708
Leaves, sniffing after
some little blonde.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.662
This bartender--is she a
brunette, by any chance?

07:02.756 --> 07:06.340
Yeah. Her name's Bo. She just
started, like, a week ago.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.839
You know, she's smokin' hot.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.840
So, you got a last name, address?

07:10.931 --> 07:14.389
No. No. She's daily. Or was, you know.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.933
She leaves on a bathroom break
and don't ever come back.

07:17.021 --> 07:18.886
Totally fired now.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.897
Rush the security tape from
the garage. Our eyes only.

07:25.988 --> 07:27.944
I want to get a look at this Bo.

07:28.032 --> 07:29.613
Gotcha.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.635
Nice place while it lasted.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.358
Ah!

08:52.449 --> 08:54.360
Shit!

08:57.204 --> 08:59.946
[BO] Sorry. I was just leaving.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.155
Where am |? Who are you?

09:01.250 --> 09:04.617
Okay. Just calm down. You're okay.
You passed out last night.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.670
I would have dropped you home, but none
of these wallets appear to be yours.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.462
It's a nice little sideline you got going.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.337
I'm a collector of rare wallets.

09:12.428 --> 09:14.384
I'm not judging. I'm glad you're okay.

09:14.471 --> 09:18.339
I don't feel okay.
What happened last night?

09:18.434 --> 09:20.140
Did somebody slip me something?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.888
Yeah, some creep in the
bar spiked your drink

09:21.979 --> 09:25.016
and you hallucinated a lot
of weird stuff, I bet.

09:25.107 --> 09:29.851
So, you didn't... you didn't eat
some dude's face in an elevator?

09:29.945 --> 09:33.529
No. There was no eating of faces.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.991
Wow, that's crazy.

09:35.075 --> 09:40.911
Thank god. That was
some creepy-ass shit.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.701
Kids and your camera phones.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.500
--Don't freak out.
--|'m freaking out.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.502
--What did I just say?
--How can I not freak out?

09:52.593 --> 09:55.005
--Have you seen you?
--Yes.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.677
--Did you kill him?
--Just slow down.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.006
Oh my God, are you going
to kill me? Oh my God.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.091
You know, that is just stupid.
Why would I save you?

10:02.186 --> 10:04.222
[whimpering]

10:04.313 --> 10:06.349
--Are you okay?
--I don't know.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.021
Can you "get" asthma?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.565
I think I'm totally getting asthma here.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.392
Just breathe.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.610
Fine. I don't need this.

10:17.701 --> 10:20.113
l have to blow town now
after saving your ass.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.616
And find somewhere else to live, again.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.573
You're welcome, by the way.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.079
Excuse me, lady, person.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.751
lt's Bo.

10:29.838 --> 10:33.205
Hi. Kenzi.

10:33.300 --> 10:39.296
Look, I'm sorry. You... You're
obviously very nice for...

10:39.389 --> 10:41.596
whatever you are.

10:41.683 --> 10:45.596
But I just had, like, the scariest,
weirdest night of my life, okay.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.929
So can we just please talk
about this like normal people?

10:49.024 --> 10:51.436
I think it's fairly clear
that I'm not exactly normal.

10:51.527 --> 10:57.238
Good. Good. Because normal
people do not help out strangers.

10:57.324 --> 11:01.158
If you were normal, I could be dead.

11:02.079 --> 11:05.412
I won't tell anyone, please,
I totally promise, okay?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.114
Just give me, like, twenty minutes.

11:07.209 --> 11:11.703
Twenty minutes and you will never, ever,
ever, have to ever see me ever again.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.621
Please.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.919
That depends.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.299
Do you like milkshakes?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.556
[HALE] Gotcha!

11:25.853 --> 11:28.310
Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.223
Hey, hey, hey, got it.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.317
That the bartender?

11:36.405 --> 11:39.272
Heading to her car with the
blond still alive and kicking.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.608
Now, look--that's the part I
don't get. Why take the kid?

11:42.703 --> 11:46.287
She want a snack for the road, what?

11:46.373 --> 11:49.206
I think she was protecting her.

11:49.293 --> 11:52.285
Hotel put a name to her John
Doe, so I pulled his jacket.

11:52.379 --> 11:56.292
He's got a few assaults. He likes
slipping things into girl's drinks.

11:56.383 --> 12:01.377
I'm thinking he targeted the blond
and the bartender stopped her.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.507
Can you make that plate?

12:03.599 --> 12:05.555
Please.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.973
Good.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.223
Put out an APB. Maintain
surveillance, but do not approach.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.680
I want us to be first on the scene.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.025
You got it.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.492
Are you just going to stare at me?

12:25.579 --> 12:28.070
Sorry.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.496
By the way,

12:29.583 --> 12:32.165
I know things could have gotten
really messed up for me last night

12:32.252 --> 12:35.244
if you hadn't shown up, so thanks.

12:35.339 --> 12:39.048
Oh, well, you're welcome.

12:40.677 --> 12:44.761
Okay, screw it. I got to know.

12:44.848 --> 12:51.219
Some things are too
stupid to say out loud. So...

12:53.440 --> 12:55.226
Here.

13:01.949 --> 13:07.410
You are a tool. And I don't
know what the hell I am.

13:07.496 --> 13:11.409
Honestly, just a freak, I guess.
Does it matter?

13:11.500 --> 13:15.914
Kinda of. I mean, what
exactly did you do to him?

13:16.004 --> 13:20.623
It's hard to explain, okay?
ljust, | sort of...

13:20.717 --> 13:22.753
| sort of drain people.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.176
Oh my god. Are you a--

13:27.140 --> 13:29.222
Dude, are you a frickin' vampire?

13:29.309 --> 13:32.722
No. No. No, it's not like that.

13:32.813 --> 13:37.102
Okay, it has nothing to do
with blood, it's just...

13:37.192 --> 13:44.485
It's this hunger that builds
and builds and then eventually, I...

13:44.574 --> 13:46.485
do what I did last night.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.909
So, you can't control it?

13:49.997 --> 13:54.161
--No.
--Wow. That's shitty.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.788
No, I'm serious. It's, like,
no way to live. You should...

13:56.878 --> 13:59.415
You should really work on that.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.498
Thanks.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.584
So, look, are we done with the
show-and-tell, 'cause I got to get going?

14:05.679 --> 14:08.637
--Can I get you anything else?
--No, we're good.

14:11.768 --> 14:15.135
I'm a little short right now.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.767
If there's, uh,

14:17.858 --> 14:22.522
any way I could come back some
other time and make it up to you?

14:22.612 --> 14:26.400
God, yes.

14:36.585 --> 14:39.452
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold up, woman.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.130
Wha-What the hell was that?

14:43.216 --> 14:46.333
I'm serious. What was that?

14:46.428 --> 14:48.635
Oh my god!

14:48.722 --> 14:50.553
[TRICK] How's the tea?

14:50.640 --> 14:54.053
Always the best. Always the best.

15:00.275 --> 15:03.017
You know when I walked
in here, that waitress--

15:03.111 --> 15:05.318
she was seriously clocking you, man.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.396
And she looks just like your type.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.698
I'm sure she does.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.819
Excuse me. I'm going to
take my game on the road.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.199
--You do that.
--Uh huh.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.451
Show you how it's done, baby.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.994
[HALE] Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.080
The girl from last night, is it her?

15:24.174 --> 15:29.009
You tell me. Female,
out-of-towner, unannounced,

15:29.096 --> 15:31.508
awfully friendly with humans.

15:31.598 --> 15:35.011
lt's beginning then.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.343
I can try and stop this.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.519
How?

15:39.606 --> 15:43.019
Well, I'm not going to kill her, but there
are ways of making someone disappear.

15:43.110 --> 15:47.900
No. No.

15:47.989 --> 15:52.779
What's meant to be must be.
We can't fight fate.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.825
Well, you can.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.701
What do you want me to do?

15:58.792 --> 16:04.082
Watch and wait. I'll help how
I can when the time comes.

16:04.172 --> 16:09.508
Hale. Mm hmm. Good job.
Okay, we're on our way.

16:11.388 --> 16:15.256
Got a call on the car.
Let's shake. Let's shake.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.215
Don't worry about it. It's on the house.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.847
--Thank you. Keep it warm, please.
--|t's on the house.

16:23.567 --> 16:27.480
You're saying you can seduce people into
doing anything just by touching them?

16:27.571 --> 16:30.734
Sort of. It wears off and takes
a lot out of me, but yeah.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.065
Yet you're broke, you
live in a crack shack,

16:33.160 --> 16:34.900
and you run from town to town.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.908
What are you doing wrong, girl?
God, that is no life for a sex superhero!

16:38.999 --> 16:41.536
You know, I think I liked you better
when you were scared of me.

16:49.217 --> 16:53.176
No. What you need is some
kind of manager. | nominate me.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.094
Shocking. And no thanks.

16:55.182 --> 16:59.516
Give me a chance.
We would make a good team.

16:59.603 --> 17:04.267
Okay, look, this isn't a joke, okay.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.313
Has it occurred to you that
hanging out with a homicidal freak

17:06.401 --> 17:08.107
might not be the
brightest move for you?

17:08.195 --> 17:12.108
Has it occurred to you that I'm capable
of making that decision for myself?

17:12.199 --> 17:14.861
"Homicidal freak." God, you are so emo.

17:14.951 --> 17:15.940
Excuse me?

17:16.036 --> 17:18.948
Learn to enjoy your shit already.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.452
You can freaking control
people by touch.

17:22.542 --> 17:27.707
And not in a creepy hand-job
way. That is awesome.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.539
Fine.

17:30.634 --> 17:34.377
Fine! Let's say I take you with me.
What's in it for you?

17:34.471 --> 17:37.304
Out here? Survival. Mama always said,

17:37.390 --> 17:41.008
"Find the toughest kid on the playground
and make friends with them."

17:41.102 --> 17:44.686
You are definitely the toughest
kid on this playground

17:44.773 --> 17:46.513
and it would kick ass
to be your friend.

17:46.608 --> 17:47.472
I don't know.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.981
Come on. Every superhero needs a
partner. Let me be your Robin.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.937
I'll think about it.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.738
Take them.

17:58.828 --> 17:59.863
Here we go.

17:59.955 --> 18:02.992
[whistling sounds]

18:03.083 --> 18:05.620
--Ah! Oh!
--[BO] Kenzi, what's wrong?

18:16.596 --> 18:19.338
--[HALE] Where are we taking her?
--[DYSON] To the Ash.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.093
He insists on an audience.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.140
[HALE] Sucks to be her.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.574
Guys, seriously,
where's my friend, huh?

18:47.669 --> 18:49.125
Where's my friend?

18:49.212 --> 18:51.453
--Okay, just take off the hood.
--A squirmish one, huh?

18:51.548 --> 18:55.541
Oh, you guys have no idea
what you are dealing with here.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.546
Okay. Just take off the hood!

18:57.637 --> 18:59.218
Calm down.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.469
I'm not saying anything
without my lawyer.

19:02.559 --> 19:05.767
--Lawyer.
--I know my rights, assholes.

19:05.854 --> 19:06.934
--Is she serious?
--C'mon.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.603
What is this place, huh?

19:10.317 --> 19:15.437
I don't understand your obstinacy.
You know the rules.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.277
Just name your clan.

19:20.368 --> 19:25.328
Buddy, for the last time,
I don't have a clan. Okay?

19:25.415 --> 19:29.124
Or bagpipes, or haggis.
I'm not frickin' Scottish.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.247
I mean, what the hell kind of cops
are you people anyway, huh?

19:32.339 --> 19:35.752
--Wh-What is this place?
--|'m starting to think she's not faking.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.925
Faking it? Aw, that's great.

19:39.012 --> 19:45.133
So, do you truly not
know what you are?

19:45.226 --> 19:46.966
What am |?

19:50.857 --> 19:51.846
[g rowls]

19:51.941 --> 19:55.104
Forget about me!
What the hell are you?

19:55.195 --> 19:59.484
I'm sorry. It's The Morrigan.
She insists on seeing her.

20:05.413 --> 20:09.702
--You were not invited.
--I know and I'm hurt.

20:09.793 --> 20:13.706
Cut the shit. Word has it that somebody's
kill was improperly dumped

20:13.797 --> 20:19.292
in your territory last night,
and not by a local.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.627
It would be nice to know if
we had a new player in town.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.053
[DYSON] We're handling it.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.131
I don't speak to the help.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.682
Hi. Yeah, hello.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.976
Could somebody please just tell me
what the hell's going on here?

20:30.063 --> 20:33.226
Lauren, take her to the lab.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.352
[THE MORRIGAN] Grab her.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.401
[growling]

20:39.447 --> 20:41.028
Enough!

20:43.910 --> 20:46.902
Lauren needs to examine the girl.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.866
Please, come with me.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.133
You and I need to talk.

21:15.275 --> 21:22.192
[speaking Russian]

21:22.282 --> 21:25.774
Because I'm your cousin and
I'm in trouble, you dick!

21:25.869 --> 21:28.861
Yeah, I know your friggin'
connections, okay.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.537
You want these wallets,
trace that plate for me,

21:31.624 --> 21:35.788
or I'm telling your mom
you're being mean.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.460
Asshole.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.884
So, what are you checking me for?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.886
Brands.

21:50.977 --> 21:57.098
Ritual scarring. Different clans
mark themselves in different ways.

21:59.319 --> 22:05.440
My god, you're beautiful.
I meant that professionally.

22:08.244 --> 22:11.987
It's cool. I, uh...

22:12.081 --> 22:14.242
I kind of have that effect on people.

22:14.334 --> 22:18.452
Uh huh. Well, that would
fit my hypothesis on you.

22:20.673 --> 22:24.086
Would you mind if I asked you some
incredibly personal questions?

22:24.177 --> 22:27.590
Well, all questions feel kind of
personal when you're commando.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.764
Right. Sorry.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.716
Please.

22:35.396 --> 22:42.143
l'll, um... I'll answer
yours if you answer mine.

22:42.237 --> 22:45.104
What the hell were those
freaks that | just met?

22:45.198 --> 22:49.658
They're Fae. An evolutionary
branch that predates on humans.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.109
So, am | Fae?

22:51.204 --> 22:57.040
Yes. Well, that's your genus,
not your species.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.378
And for those of us
who flunked biology?

22:59.462 --> 23:06.300
I meant, Fae is a general classification.
There are many different types.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.798
So, what type are you?

23:08.888 --> 23:14.303
The insatiably curious
human doctor type.

23:14.394 --> 23:19.138
--|'m in it for the science.
--Oh, kinky.

23:19.232 --> 23:23.976
Now for the million dollar question:

23:24.070 --> 23:26.652
What kind of Fae am |?

23:26.739 --> 23:31.654
The girl doesn't even know she's Fae.
She's as ignorant as a human.

23:31.744 --> 23:36.829
So are you if you believe her. Oh,
come on. I mean, listen to yourself.

23:36.916 --> 23:41.159
You're not seriously suggesting that
she's been hidden from us since birth?

23:41.254 --> 23:44.417
l'm suggesting we need to be
united in how we deal with this.

23:44.507 --> 23:48.170
Little problem--l'm not
much of a team player.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.673
|f word gets out we've had
a free Fae under our noses,

23:50.763 --> 23:52.594
we'll be the laughing
stock of the Counties.

23:52.682 --> 23:55.173
Well, then it's agreed. Let's just kill
the little bitch and be done with it.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.599
It would be wiser to wait.

23:56.686 --> 24:04.900
Tell me... was your neutering
ceremonial, or a birth defect?

24:04.986 --> 24:07.773
Her freedom is dangerous to us both.

24:07.864 --> 24:10.355
She cannot be allowed to
exist in between our sides.

24:10.450 --> 24:16.411
Which is why we need to make her
choose between us. The old way.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.872
I examined your kill from last night,

24:19.959 --> 24:23.292
and based on your feeding
signature, you're...

24:23.379 --> 24:25.540
Just say it.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.714
You're a succubus.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.586
A succubus.

24:33.306 --> 24:36.719
Can you fix it?

24:36.809 --> 24:38.720
Well, there's nothing to fix.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.644
You're a perfect biological
specimen of your kind.

24:41.731 --> 24:45.770
Who has a habit of waking
up next to dead lovers.

24:45.860 --> 24:49.227
I mean, if that's not sick, then I
would like a second opinion.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.780
We can help you learn to
control it, if you like.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.823
--That's possible?
--Definitely.

24:54.911 --> 24:58.574
If you'd been born into a clan, you
would have been taught how by now.

24:58.665 --> 25:03.750
You'd still have to feed, but you
wouldn't always have to kill.

25:03.836 --> 25:07.670
You deserve a normal life
and we can offer that to you.

25:07.757 --> 25:09.293
What's the catch?

25:09.384 --> 25:13.093
The Fae are divided.
The light and the dark.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.919
I presume they'd want
you to join one of them

25:15.014 --> 25:18.347
before they'd allow me
to offer you much help.

25:25.525 --> 25:29.017
I can offer you things...

25:29.112 --> 25:31.945
if we get out of here.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.987
I know what you're doing.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.737
--Do you want me to stop?
--No.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.453
You didn't think it was going
to be that easy, did you?

25:45.545 --> 25:47.536
A girl can dream, can't she?

25:47.630 --> 25:49.370
Hands, please.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.719
Sorry. Had to try.

25:53.803 --> 25:58.638
No. Good. No, it was
very informative.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.966
--Where are you taking her?
--The glass factory.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.391
Why?

26:02.478 --> 26:06.141
lt's neutral territory. They're
going to give her the test.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.474
Without training? That's madness.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.355
It's not our call.

26:21.122 --> 26:27.163
[speaking Russian] Did you get it?
Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Okay.

26:27.253 --> 26:34.625
Providence Glass Inc. on Front.
Thank you. Owe you one. Bye.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.888
Okay.

27:15.885 --> 27:20.629
Party at the glass factory.
That's not weird.

27:37.824 --> 27:42.409
Ew. Pardon the "Turkish prison" chic.

27:42.495 --> 27:45.407
It's a little obvious for my taste.

27:45.498 --> 27:50.413
We can manage chairs, at least.
We're civilized folk.

27:50.503 --> 27:53.586
By the way, congrats on
your Amnesia Girl routine.

27:53.673 --> 27:56.460
You got everybody buying it.

27:56.551 --> 27:59.509
But between you and l,

27:59.595 --> 28:02.758
you know more than
you're telling, don't you?

28:02.849 --> 28:05.682
--Do you?
--O kay.

28:05.768 --> 28:09.761
A girl's got to have her
mystery. I can respect that.

28:09.856 --> 28:15.442
I'm sorry, not to interrupt
your crazy, but who are you?

28:15.528 --> 28:20.443
Local government. Consider me the
welcome wagon for the dark Fae.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.525
Do you know why you've
been brought here today?

28:23.619 --> 28:27.658
--You're going to be tested.
--Oh, wow! Will there be math?

28:27.748 --> 28:32.117
Funny. She's funny.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.792
Listen here, Norma Fae.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.338
We have a millennia-old two-party
system and it works just swell.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.882
Because membership is mandatory.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.505
Well, I must have lost my invitation--

28:41.596 --> 28:45.885
Which is a problem. You see, you
running around free and non-partisan

28:45.975 --> 28:48.057
gives all the little lemmings ideas.

28:48.144 --> 28:54.310
I don't want any trouble, okay?
Promise. Just let me go.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.642
Well, lucky for you, if you
survive your test today,

28:57.737 --> 29:01.150
you'll have the opportunity
to join a side. Problem solved.

29:01.240 --> 29:05.028
Join? Why the hell would
I want to do that?

29:05.119 --> 29:07.326
We take care of our own.

29:07.413 --> 29:11.031
We'll place you in a human
occupation that is to our advantage,

29:11.125 --> 29:17.246
help with the disposal of your kills,
et cetera, et cetera. Oh! And dental.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.420
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.543
You should.

29:24.263 --> 29:28.597
I hear you've been
alone for a long time.

29:28.684 --> 29:33.348
No friends or family. Afraid
you'd kill them, I'd imagine.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.772
Sounds lonely.

29:36.859 --> 29:41.444
You have the chance to be
a part of something now.

29:41.530 --> 29:47.571
A chance to have a new
family, or to have enemies.

29:47.662 --> 29:53.578
So, be very careful how you
play the next few hours.

29:56.337 --> 30:01.673
Welcome to the top of the food
chain, doll. Enjoy it while it lasts.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.839
So, what exactly am | in for here, huh?

30:43.926 --> 30:46.759
Big bad nasties?
The Loch Ness Monster?

30:46.846 --> 30:49.178
--Underfae.
--Under-what-now?

30:53.519 --> 30:56.932
Very old, very dangerous.
You'll face two.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.264
--We|l, what are my chances?
--I wouldn't bet on you.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.441
Have I spit in your coffee or
something? What is your deal?

31:02.528 --> 31:04.029
Kiss me.

31:04.113 --> 31:06.024
Wow, are you bad at reading women.

31:06.115 --> 31:08.777
We don't have time for this. You need
all of the strength you can get,

31:08.868 --> 31:10.324
so take some of mine.

31:10.411 --> 31:11.821
Won't I kill you?

31:11.912 --> 31:13.823
Just kiss me.

31:35.936 --> 31:39.520
Oh. Oh. Wow!

31:39.607 --> 31:42.144
Did you... did you feel that?
That was like...

31:42.234 --> 31:47.149
That was like the Fourth
of July in my mouth.

31:47.239 --> 31:53.326
Hey. You stopped me. No one's
ever stopped me before.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.745
Fae are different than humans. Your
powers won't work the same on all of us.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.209
Well, how am I supposed
to beat these guys?

32:01.587 --> 32:04.329
You be faster, you be smarter.

32:04.423 --> 32:08.382
They're going to underestimate you,
use that to your advantage.

32:08.469 --> 32:13.680
| misjudged you.
You got any other advice?

32:13.766 --> 32:15.506
Don't get dead.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.217
And you're back to being
an asshole. It's nice.

32:43.379 --> 32:48.339
[crowd chanting and clapping]

32:50.177 --> 32:52.793
l was not expecting Thunderdome.

32:56.308 --> 33:03.271
He's big, but he's slow. These are
your weapons. Choose wisely.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.768
[cheering]

33:05.860 --> 33:07.771
[howling]

33:07.862 --> 33:09.602
Good luck.

33:14.535 --> 33:17.618
[roaring]

33:34.346 --> 33:36.302
Enough!

33:39.852 --> 33:41.513
To the death.

33:41.604 --> 33:45.392
[cheering]

33:51.030 --> 33:52.941
What are they feeding
you down here?

33:53.032 --> 33:54.568
[roaring]

34:01.707 --> 34:03.413
[roaring]

34:26.607 --> 34:29.019
She's probably in there having tea.

34:35.658 --> 34:41.403
Oh, please don't be rats. Please
don't be rats. Please don't be rats.

34:52.508 --> 34:54.419
[roaring]

34:59.348 --> 35:00.963
Gross.

35:05.104 --> 35:09.063
[crowd goes quiet]

35:37.970 --> 35:39.585
Hello.

35:42.516 --> 35:43.380
Hi.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.308
Would you like some tea?

35:46.395 --> 35:51.310
--What just happened?
--I thought we could use some privacy.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.858
Please, sit down.

36:00.242 --> 36:05.828
We don't have much time.
I want to help you.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.120
How?

36:07.207 --> 36:13.498
I'm a Pain Eater. Let me take yours.

36:13.589 --> 36:18.299
I can end your suffering
if you'll trust me.

36:27.353 --> 36:32.143
[growling]

36:37.029 --> 36:38.894
Hello?

36:42.076 --> 36:43.532
Okay.

37:18.070 --> 37:20.356
I'd like to show you something.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.411
Those are your dead.

37:29.498 --> 37:32.365
l-l don't want to be here anymore.
I don't want to see this.

37:32.459 --> 37:37.920
That's all you've been doing,
ten long years, killing and running.

37:38.006 --> 37:41.498
Killing and running.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.845
Aren't you tired?

37:43.929 --> 37:45.044
Yes.

37:45.139 --> 37:48.882
How many more will have
to die so you can live?

37:48.976 --> 37:53.561
No, no, it's not like that anymore.
l-l know what I really am.

37:53.647 --> 37:56.184
They told me that I can
learn how to fight it.

37:56.275 --> 38:00.359
You don't actually
believe that, do you?

38:00.446 --> 38:07.363
You're an abomination, child.
You know it in your heart.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.944
Do the right thing.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.838
Oh, Bo.

38:29.725 --> 38:33.388
But I don't know what
the right thing is anymore.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.891
Can you help me?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.767
If you're willing.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.061
What is it?

38:41.153 --> 38:48.867
Your way out. You'll sleep
and never wake up.

38:50.871 --> 38:51.781
I don't know.

38:51.872 --> 38:55.660
It will be quick and beautiful.

38:55.751 --> 38:58.288
A gesture of love.

38:58.378 --> 39:03.418
No one will even miss you.
No one will mourn you.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.500
Nobody needs you.

39:05.594 --> 39:09.633
[KENZl] Bo, wake up!
Bo, wake up, dammit!

39:09.723 --> 39:16.435
Bo, wake up! Wake up!
Bo, he's killing you. Wake up!

39:16.522 --> 39:18.262
--Drink.
--[KENZ|] Bo!

39:18.357 --> 39:20.769
--Drink.
--[KENZ|] Bo! Bo!

39:20.859 --> 39:24.943
Let me go, you big lughead! Bo!

39:25.030 --> 39:28.022
--Bo, wake up!
--Drink.

39:28.116 --> 39:30.778
No. No.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.327
Get out of my head, you freak. Ugh!

39:37.751 --> 39:39.161
Help!

39:40.212 --> 39:41.622
Ah!

39:41.713 --> 39:43.578
She's mine.

39:46.468 --> 39:53.556
This one has passed the test.
It has been witnessed.

39:53.642 --> 39:58.136
Child, you may name your side.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.972
Neither.
[crowd booing]

40:01.066 --> 40:03.853
I choose Humans.
[crowd booing]

40:25.507 --> 40:31.377
Now can we kill her? She passes
without any training.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.336
Who is this girl?

40:33.432 --> 40:36.048
May I offer an opinion?

40:36.143 --> 40:38.850
You have no station here, old man.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.896
Don't you have some shoes to
cobble or a garden to decorate?

40:46.528 --> 40:50.362
Someone hid her from both our sides.

40:50.449 --> 40:54.943
It would be wise to learn
why and who before killing her.

40:55.037 --> 40:57.403
Great. And in the meantime,
she could expose us all.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.362
Not without exposing herself.

40:59.458 --> 41:04.623
I'm not saying there won't be a time
when she needs to be put down.

41:04.713 --> 41:08.297
I'm saying choose it wisely.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.775
| feel like we've been paroled.

41:36.870 --> 41:39.282
You sort of have been.

41:39.373 --> 41:42.456
Any conditions on our release?

41:42.542 --> 41:46.581
No more evidence for humans to find.
No messing in Fae business.

41:46.672 --> 41:53.009
And no more leaving town. The Elders
want you where they can watch you.

41:53.095 --> 41:57.088
Well, they don't own me. And I'm
not very good at being obedient.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.798
Learn. And when you need help--

41:59.893 --> 42:01.929
lfl need help.

42:02.020 --> 42:06.684
When you need help, you can
find me at the 39th Division.

42:09.194 --> 42:13.733
And Bo, you did well.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.650
I knew I smelled popo.

42:28.130 --> 42:31.463
[KENZl] I'm not crazy, right?
That all just happened?

42:31.550 --> 42:36.795
[BO] Yep. And now we know.
Anyone could be Fae.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.630
[KENZI] My bets on wiener dude.

42:39.725 --> 42:43.058
So, what now?

42:43.145 --> 42:46.808
We go home. And we figure
out the rest tomorrow.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.513
"We," huh?

42:50.777 --> 42:53.234
I got to figure out some way to
make a living while I'm here,

42:53.321 --> 42:57.655
and you're the one who thought
we'd be a good team so, yeah, we.

42:57.743 --> 43:03.579
Cool. Just so we're clear about this
partnership, you be you 'n all,

43:03.665 --> 43:06.532
but I'm only into guys. Sorry.

43:06.626 --> 43:09.709
[BO] I'll try to contain
my disappointment.
