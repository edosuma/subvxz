[Dietrich] I can't believe
Nolan Tremblé's here<i>.</i>

00:44.291 --> 00:46.625
Do you think he'll be wearing
his signature snow helmet?

00:46.708 --> 00:48.541
-Nolan, who?
-Wha--

00:48.625 --> 00:53.708
Nolan Tremblé,
the star of Canada's hit reality show,

00:53.791 --> 00:55.625
<i>Alberta Plow Force.</i>

00:55.708 --> 00:58.166
He was voted Saskatchewan's sexiest man.

00:58.250 --> 00:59.083
Twice!

00:59.166 --> 01:02.875
He also bakes and writes poems.

01:02.958 --> 01:04.000
[clears throat]

01:04.083 --> 01:05.208
Oh God, don't do it.

No. Just no. [gags]

01:14.250 --> 01:16.333
Cisgender folk poetry is the worst.

01:16.416 --> 01:17.916
TV ready!

01:18.000 --> 01:20.458
Uh, you look like
an overstuffed freemason,

01:20.541 --> 01:22.625
and your jugular
is throbbing like a fox penis.

01:22.708 --> 01:27.708
I had this tux custom made
when I was on leave in Bangkok in 1991.

01:27.791 --> 01:31.666
It's a tad snug,
but classic style never goes out of…

01:31.750 --> 01:33.666
[groans] …style?

01:33.750 --> 01:37.666
Ow! Change back
into your field clothes, seriously.

01:37.750 --> 01:38.958
-[BTG sighing]
-Ugh!

01:40.250 --> 01:41.541
Much better.

01:41.625 --> 01:44.791
You okay? You're sweating
like a nun on a nude beach.

01:44.875 --> 01:46.291
I'm a little nervous.

01:46.375 --> 01:51.125
This is my first big TV appearance,
and, ugh, Hollywood is not my world.

01:51.208 --> 01:53.166
I'm a forest creature at heart.

01:53.250 --> 01:56.000
[inhales] Bright lights
and fake smiles unnerve me.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.041
But you went on that game show.

01:58.125 --> 02:00.333
Name a noise a tiger makes.

-[crows groans]

02:02.958 --> 02:04.916
Oh, it's also known as chuffing.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.500
-[buzzer buzzing]
-It's how they greet each other.

02:07.583 --> 02:09.208

-[crowd groans]

02:09.291 --> 02:12.041
-The correct answer was "roar."
-[audience applauding]

02:12.125 --> 02:15.833
We also would have accepted "roar."

02:15.916 --> 02:17.208
Ugh!

02:17.291 --> 02:18.500
I hate television.

02:18.583 --> 02:19.958
You'll be great!

02:20.041 --> 02:22.583
This is your one chance
to increase your profile,

02:22.666 --> 02:26.041
secure expedition funding,
and finally win the respect

02:26.125 --> 02:28.958
you've been seeking
your entire professional life.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.000
Oh, crap. Now I'm nervous.

02:31.083 --> 02:33.208
[laughs] Thanks, Bonbon. Great talk.

02:33.291 --> 02:34.375
[thudding, crashing]

02:34.458 --> 02:37.666
-[yelps]
-I put the cassowary in your bathroom.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.708
He's a tad ornery.
In other words, a normal cassowary.

02:41.791 --> 02:45.583
It'd be nice to get him to our compound,
but show business waits for no one.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.916
-[banging on door]
-[screams]

02:47.000 --> 02:50.333
Okay, maybe show business
should wait for a cassowary.

-Mister, uh…
-[cassowary calling]

-[banging on door]
-Barnaby Trevor Greive.

03:03.125 --> 03:04.708
Uh, it's Bradley Trevor Greive.

03:04.791 --> 03:07.875
Don't sass me, Barnaby!
The clipboard's never wrong!

03:07.958 --> 03:11.833
Name's Babs Mahoney,
and this is not my first spit roast.

03:11.916 --> 03:15.750
Ugh! You look like a scarecrow
that ate another scarecrow.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.416
You, production assistant.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.750
Who, me? [laughs]

03:18.833 --> 03:21.375
Oh no, I'm a field assistant.

03:21.458 --> 03:23.750
Though, I suppose
the skill set is transferable.

03:23.833 --> 03:26.083
That's great,
you're such a special little flower.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.916
Now, have wardrobe fly in
a clean vest for Barnaby,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.708
and make it extra, extra…

03:31.750 --> 03:33.333
extra-large.

03:33.416 --> 03:35.250
-Ouch.
-B-B-But I…

03:35.333 --> 03:38.000
Just haul ass
before I put my spanking gloves on.

03:38.083 --> 03:39.791
Yes, Mommy. I mean, ma'am.

03:39.875 --> 03:42.083
[sighing] All right,
time for some ground rules, Barnaby.

03:42.166 --> 03:46.583
I don't want any animals or musicians
leaving bodily fluids on my stage.

03:46.666 --> 03:48.750
Do not let Jimmy touch the animals.

03:48.833 --> 03:49.666
Do not.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.250
He's overconfident,
and we're underinsured.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.250
Plus, he's a bleeder. Capisce?

03:54.333 --> 03:56.333
-Hmm?
-[swans trumpeting]

03:58.000 --> 04:00.208
Well, hello, young love.

04:00.291 --> 04:03.500
Reminds me of my honeymoon
with my fourth husband, Darryl.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.541
[scoffs] He was a real weasel.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.583
I swear, men and women… Ugh!

04:07.666 --> 04:08.625
It never works!

04:08.708 --> 04:13.416
Well, actually,
this happy couple are both cobs, males.

04:13.916 --> 04:16.375
Uh, a quarter
of all black swan pairs are gay,

04:16.458 --> 04:20.666
and they bond for life and will raise
a female's fertilized eggs as their own.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.666
In fact, due to their size and aggression,

04:23.750 --> 04:27.333
gay swans are more successful
at keeping their babies safe

04:27.416 --> 04:28.416
than straight swans.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.750
Oh. Happily married gay swans, huh?

04:31.833 --> 04:33.166
That's not nothing.

04:33.750 --> 04:36.000
-Unless you're a poop peddler, Barnaby.
-[gasps]

04:36.083 --> 04:39.000
Don't sell me poop on a stick
and call it cotton candy!

04:39.083 --> 04:40.000
I… What?

04:40.083 --> 04:44.375
No, virtually every animal in nature
exhibits queer behavior.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.958
Here come the statuesque giraffe!

04:47.041 --> 04:50.666
Did you know that 90%
of all male giraffes' sexual activity

04:50.750 --> 04:51.833
is homosexual?

04:51.916 --> 04:54.125
Wow. Just like me in high school.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.625
Inappropriate uncle talk, Bonnie.

04:56.708 --> 05:02.083
And here are more male animals
who enjoy gay sex for pleasure,

05:02.166 --> 05:05.416
to ensure social harmony,
and to relieve stress.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.750
[grunting]

05:06.833 --> 05:10.416
Can you even imagine
having a bison parked in your garage?

05:10.500 --> 05:11.583
Amazing!

05:11.666 --> 05:14.416
Why would a bison be parked in… Oh, I see.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.708
Oral sex is universally popular.

05:17.791 --> 05:22.750
Female hyenas lick each other's genitals,
which are actually false penises.

05:22.833 --> 05:25.875
It's like eating Thanksgiving Dinner
on Christmas Day.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.541
[groans] Bonnie, please.

05:27.625 --> 05:31.875
Oh, and here's the always popular
bonobo float.

05:31.958 --> 05:34.458
Bonobo chimps
are our closest living relatives,

05:34.541 --> 05:37.458
and they're all 100% bisexual.

05:37.541 --> 05:40.833
Oh, uninhibited jungle sex is so hot.

05:40.916 --> 05:42.250
Mm-mm, agreed.

05:42.333 --> 05:46.208
And both male and female bonobos
use sex to resolve conflict.

05:46.291 --> 05:49.583
It's called make-up sex,
or sometimes hate-[bleep].

05:49.666 --> 05:50.500
Bonnie!

05:50.583 --> 05:52.083
Queer animals.

05:52.166 --> 05:55.166
Now, that's
a Peabody-worthy idea. [laughs]

05:55.250 --> 05:58.791
You're not the brain-dead barf bag
I thought you were, Barnaby.

05:58.875 --> 06:01.250
Okay, I want the whole segment
to be queer.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.541
From soup to nuts.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.166
What queer animals you got, huh?

06:04.250 --> 06:07.541
Well, we live on a queer planet,
so all of them.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.083
This is gonna be great.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.041
I'm queer, and I feel strongly that--

06:11.125 --> 06:13.833
Ah, good for you.
Yeah, rainbow is my favorite color.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.250
Whatever. Now, shush!

06:15.333 --> 06:17.041
-[footsteps approaching]
-You hear that?

06:17.125 --> 06:19.125
Someone useless is coming.

06:19.208 --> 06:23.583
Adventure man wardrobe
for Barnaby Trevor--

06:23.666 --> 06:27.541
Is it "Grave" or "Grive?" [laughs]

06:27.625 --> 06:29.083
[Babs] Here, wear this.

06:29.166 --> 06:31.333
-[BTG] Ow!
-Now, go and get your queer animals ready.

06:31.416 --> 06:33.708
Oh, and please, keep it G-rated, huh?

06:33.791 --> 06:37.791
People in Tuscaloosa
don't wanna hear all the messy details.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.541
The messy details are the best part.

06:39.625 --> 06:43.041
Hey, I'm looking for my 18th Emmy,
not my 18th heart attack.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.708
I was hoping we could talk
about that script I've been working on

06:45.791 --> 06:47.500
-when you get a chance.
-[door slams]

06:47.583 --> 06:50.375
Yes! I'm making it happen.

06:50.458 --> 06:53.333
You know you're not really
a production assistant, right?

06:53.416 --> 06:58.583
These golf cart keys say otherwise,
Bonnie, uh, T. Greive.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.125
You just don't get it.

07:00.208 --> 07:02.416
Hollywood makes my blood jump.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.375
The glitz, the glam.

07:04.458 --> 07:08.958
-I am working with <i>the</i> Nolan Tremblé.
-[ethereal music plays]

07:09.708 --> 07:11.500
-Nolan, who?
-[clattering]

07:11.583 --> 07:13.333
Quiet, dammit. This is a hot set.

07:13.416 --> 07:14.791
-[water gushing]
-Oh, crap!

07:16.750 --> 07:19.708
-[cassowary calling]
-[people screaming]

07:22.958 --> 07:25.583
He's eating Nolan Tremblé's fruit bouquet!

07:25.666 --> 07:27.875
Huh. This is so unexpected.

07:27.958 --> 07:31.333
<i>Male cassowaries are far more docile</i>
<i>than the females.</i>

07:31.416 --> 07:34.666
<i>The males are petite stay-at-home dads</i>
<i>who sit on the eggs,</i>

07:34.750 --> 07:37.583
<i>while female cassowaries</i>
<i>are huge, murderous amazons.</i>

07:37.666 --> 07:38.750
[roaring]

07:38.833 --> 07:41.208
Murderous amazons? Nice!

07:41.291 --> 07:43.666
-I wish I was a petite stay-at-home dad.
-[dishes clattering]

07:46.708 --> 07:48.416
[grunting]

07:49.458 --> 07:50.458
[both] Whoa!

07:50.541 --> 07:51.833
[cassowary grunting]

07:51.916 --> 07:54.833
No! No, no, no, no!

07:54.916 --> 07:57.291
-[groaning] We're good.
-No, we're not!

07:57.875 --> 08:00.250
Was the honeydew in front
or the star fruit?

08:00.333 --> 08:03.125
Why is there so much cantaloupe?

08:04.416 --> 08:05.250
Huh?

08:08.791 --> 08:10.791
-[scratching]
-[clattering]

08:12.708 --> 08:15.125
Oh yeah. It's retractable.

08:17.833 --> 08:18.875
Ah! Oh!

08:18.958 --> 08:20.416
[swans trumpeting]

08:20.500 --> 08:21.791
So sorry.

08:21.875 --> 08:23.416
-Excuse us.
-Aw!

08:23.500 --> 08:26.541

08:31.041 --> 08:32.541
-[all gasp]
-[hisses]

08:32.625 --> 08:35.875
Ooh! Passion is equal parts joy and fury.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.583
[cassowary calling]

08:37.666 --> 08:39.458
He's in there.

08:39.541 --> 08:41.000
Okay, great.

08:41.083 --> 08:43.250
Let's go in there.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.750
We can't go in there, Bonnie.

08:45.833 --> 08:47.583
It's the woman's restroom.

08:47.666 --> 08:50.041
-The one place men can never go.
-[clattering]

08:50.125 --> 08:50.958
Ever.

08:51.041 --> 08:53.833
We're talking about a feathered dinosaur
with knife toes.

08:53.916 --> 08:56.500
You'd rather urinating women
get bird murdered

08:56.583 --> 08:57.708
than embarrass yourself?

08:57.791 --> 08:59.750
Absolutely.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.083
I'm no hero.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.916
-I'm ashamed, but yes.
-[clattering]

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
[cassowary grunting]

09:05.083 --> 09:06.000
Agh!

09:07.250 --> 09:09.250
We made the right call, BTG.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.833
One time, when I was 11,

09:10.916 --> 09:13.166
I accidentally walked
into a woman's restroom,

09:13.250 --> 09:15.416
and there were no urinals.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.083
I have so many questions.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.291
Right.

09:18.375 --> 09:22.458
Well, at least in nature,
gender norms aren't so limiting.

09:22.541 --> 09:24.791
Common reed frogs change
from female to male

09:24.875 --> 09:26.291
if there aren't males around.

09:26.375 --> 09:30.041
Banana slugs
have both female and male genitals,

09:30.125 --> 09:32.625
which is true of all terrestrial mollusks.

09:32.708 --> 09:36.666
And whiptail lizards are all female
and don't need a male to reproduce.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.333
Mmm. I like the sound of that part.

09:39.416 --> 09:41.875
-Uh, which part?
-Incoming murder bird!

09:41.958 --> 09:43.333
-[screams]
-[calling]

09:44.041 --> 09:46.958
He's in the open.
Dammit, we'll never catch him on foot.

09:47.708 --> 09:49.333
[adventurous music playing]

[growls]

12:50.166 --> 12:51.500
Not exactly.

12:51.583 --> 12:55.041
But male fruit bats
frequently fellate each other,

12:55.125 --> 12:58.458
which is a common behavior
when female bats are not in estrus.

Almost every animal enjoys oral sex,
regardless of gender.

because they have a four-headed penis.

You need a shovel, and a mop,
and a squeegee for the ceiling.
