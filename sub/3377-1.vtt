07:35.625 --> 07:37.625
Stand up.

07:46.166 --> 07:50.167
- You used to be faster.
- You used to have more hair.

07:52.667 --> 07:56.131
Look at you. What a mess!

07:56.167 --> 07:58.167
What happened
to that uniform...

07:58.204 --> 08:00.167
You used to be so proud of?

08:02.667 --> 08:04.918
You've been roaming
the wastelands,

08:04.954 --> 08:07.168
brawling with half-men,
no doubt.

08:07.204 --> 08:09.168
A man needs his exercise.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.210
It's good to see you, sir.

08:26.710 --> 08:29.211
I believe we were heading
for the same tavern.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.210
Let's go have a drink.

08:36.210 --> 08:39.711
- Peacemaker?
- You think I'm too old?

08:41.211 --> 08:43.961
I can still toss five
of the likes of you.

08:43.996 --> 08:46.711
I didn't teach you
every trick I know.

08:48.711 --> 08:50.711
Taught me enough
not to argue with you.

08:56.212 --> 08:59.175
Peacemaker is
a respectable job.

08:59.211 --> 09:02.211
You should try it.

09:02.753 --> 09:05.753
How long do you intend to
live out in the wastelands?

09:07.753 --> 09:11.217
It's my home.

09:11.254 --> 09:14.754
What happened to regend and
lauria wasn't your fault.

09:15.253 --> 09:18.254
We've all lost families
because of the war.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.218
You have to let go.

09:20.254 --> 09:23.718
The wasteland suits me fine.

09:23.755 --> 09:26.254
So where's meridian?
I've never heard of it.

09:26.291 --> 09:29.718
It's a small settlement
to the east.

09:29.754 --> 09:32.255
They're having disputes
over water rights.

09:32.754 --> 09:34.718
Why you? Why not
send the enforcers?

09:34.754 --> 09:39.755
Because the council didn't deem
it big enough for the enforcers.

09:39.792 --> 09:43.755
And I have a personal
interest in meridian.

09:47.297 --> 09:49.297
I've given up teaching.

09:49.797 --> 09:53.797
I don't want to show
people to fight anymore.

09:53.834 --> 09:55.761
The times are changing.

09:55.797 --> 09:58.797
There are more important
things to do today.

09:58.834 --> 10:02.261
Those of us who survived
the wars...

10:02.297 --> 10:04.798
Have a responsibility
to those who didn't.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.819
Mom, look!

18:51.861 --> 18:55.362
Wh-what the hell's that?

19:04.361 --> 19:05.862
Spare some water?

19:08.362 --> 19:10.825
I'll pay.

19:10.862 --> 19:15.362
No need. Jux.

19:15.862 --> 19:18.362
Go get some water, please.

19:20.862 --> 19:23.862
You're not from meridian,
are you? No, ma'am.

19:25.363 --> 19:27.863
You come about the work?

19:27.899 --> 19:30.368
Maybe.

19:30.404 --> 19:33.904
Ever work on
a purification farm before?

19:35.904 --> 19:37.904
Farming's a little
out of my line, but...

19:42.905 --> 19:44.905
Still, when I have to,
I can manage.

19:47.405 --> 19:49.405
What I'm offering
is food and shelter.

19:52.405 --> 19:54.906
Food sounds good.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.739
Come on in.

20:30.282 --> 20:33.746
My name's kasha.
What shall we call you?

20:33.782 --> 20:36.282
Whatever you like.
I'm not particular.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.783
This is tark, my foreman.

20:45.282 --> 20:48.246
Tooey and off, his helpers.

20:48.283 --> 20:51.283
Tooey will show you to your quarters
where you can store your belongings.

20:51.319 --> 20:53.825
I hope you like it here.

21:13.825 --> 21:16.326
Tooey, back to work.

21:22.325 --> 21:25.826
You might as well know
the layout from the start.

21:25.862 --> 21:28.290
I'mhead dog on this farm.

21:28.326 --> 21:31.326
That woman and child
are under my protection,

21:31.827 --> 21:34.368
so, unless you want
to answer to me,

21:34.404 --> 21:37.868
don't go making trouble for us.

21:37.904 --> 21:41.368
Understand?

21:41.405 --> 21:43.869
Mm.

22:17.412 --> 22:19.911
- What are you buildin'?
- A wind racer.

22:28.412 --> 22:31.912
You're doing
a dandy job, fellows.

22:34.913 --> 22:38.375
Straight ahead now.

22:38.412 --> 22:42.413
A little to the left,
please, and thank you!

22:42.449 --> 22:45.876
And break, lads. Hello, cali.

22:45.912 --> 22:48.876
Where'd you get that
dirge? Designed it myself.

22:48.913 --> 22:51.913
Good. Wouldn't it be easier
to walk on your hands?

22:53.913 --> 22:56.954
Cali. It's good to see you.

22:57.954 --> 23:00.455
I've got something for you.

23:00.955 --> 23:03.955
A letter, all the way
from the city.

23:06.456 --> 23:08.455
Can I invite you
and your friends in for lunch?

23:08.492 --> 23:10.455
Oh, another time, perhaps.

23:10.955 --> 23:13.455
My medical expertise
is in need.

23:13.956 --> 23:15.956
Not a moment to lose!
Come along, chaps.

23:17.956 --> 23:21.456
- Off we go.
- See you at the gathering tonight.

23:22.955 --> 23:25.956
Straight ahead, lads.

23:49.998 --> 23:53.248
Those won't grow. What?

23:53.285 --> 23:56.142
Those won't grow. Why not?

23:56.178 --> 23:58.999
You planted them upside down.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.005
Too close together.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.542
They should be this far apart.

24:28.041 --> 24:33.542
- Your mother teach you that?
- No, my father did. But he's dead now.

24:33.578 --> 24:36.005
In the war.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.542
He was a commander.
Commander terran.

24:40.542 --> 24:43.043
- I knew him.
- You knew him?

24:44.542 --> 24:46.542
He was a great man.

24:50.543 --> 24:53.042
What's your name? Jux.

24:55.043 --> 24:57.043
Well, jux, I'll tell you what:

24:57.543 --> 24:59.506
You help me with my farm work,

24:59.543 --> 25:02.585
I'll help you build
that wind racer.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.085
Deal.

25:17.586 --> 25:20.549
Tark.

25:20.585 --> 25:23.086
Hitch up the wagon and
ask the new man to join us.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.049
We're taking him along?

25:26.086 --> 25:28.086
I wouldn't trust him
here alone.

25:30.586 --> 25:34.086
Together, we are strong.

25:34.586 --> 25:37.086
Strong in our commitment,

25:37.123 --> 25:39.550
strong in our purpose.

25:39.587 --> 25:44.091
We must make
this land live again.

25:44.128 --> 25:47.628
Let us not weaken ourselves
by leaving the valley,

25:47.665 --> 25:49.628
as so many have already done.

25:50.628 --> 25:54.092
Help us to brave
the summer sandstorms.

25:54.128 --> 25:59.629
Let us hold strong against the heat of
the wind that cuts through our valley.

25:59.665 --> 26:03.129
And let us have the strength
to fight even the violence...

26:03.166 --> 26:06.129
Which arises from
our valley as well.

26:08.629 --> 26:12.629
- Welcome, kasha.
- May I speak?

26:21.630 --> 26:23.130
For years now,

26:23.630 --> 26:28.172
I've been advising you
to hold onto your land.

26:28.208 --> 26:30.672
At times, it hasn't
seemed worth it.

26:30.709 --> 26:35.135
But times are about to change.

26:35.172 --> 26:39.672
I have just received a letter
from the council of the order.

26:39.708 --> 26:42.673
A peacemaker has been
appointed to this settlement!

26:58.173 --> 27:00.173
The days of fear are over.

27:00.673 --> 27:02.673
Now we can farm our land.

27:04.173 --> 27:07.716
Seems I arrived
just in time for a speech.

27:09.215 --> 27:12.178
That's damnil.

27:12.215 --> 27:15.179
It's just as well
you're here, damnil.

27:15.216 --> 27:19.716
The peacemaker's arrival is more
significant to you than the rest of us.

27:19.753 --> 27:22.716
Ah, yes. The peacemaker.

27:23.215 --> 27:25.215
I've known about that
appointment for some time.

27:25.716 --> 27:29.216
No one would be happier to
see a peacemaker than I would.

27:29.253 --> 27:31.716
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

27:32.216 --> 27:35.966
There's a lot of dangerous land
between here and the city.

27:36.002 --> 27:39.716
Anything could happen to a
peacemaker on the road these days.

27:39.753 --> 27:41.680
Until he arrives,

27:41.716 --> 27:45.217
I... am the authority...

27:45.717 --> 27:48.216
In this valley!

28:20.260 --> 28:24.760
Five cents! Five cents!

28:31.302 --> 28:33.302
Whoa. Ho.

28:52.803 --> 28:55.303
Hello, kasha.
Father has your package.

28:56.303 --> 28:58.303
The valve.

28:59.303 --> 29:01.804
Come on, jux. Let's play!

29:11.304 --> 29:13.808
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Come on! Hey. Hey.

29:13.845 --> 29:16.345
Come on, you owe me
a beer. Knock it off.

29:16.382 --> 29:18.809
Knock it off.

29:18.846 --> 29:21.346
Guess your weight. Step right
up, I'll guess your weight.

29:21.383 --> 29:25.845
Hey. Isn't that her wagon?

29:25.882 --> 29:28.309
Yeah.

29:28.346 --> 29:30.346
Let's go, then.

29:30.846 --> 29:32.810
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.

29:32.846 --> 29:35.346
It hurt me much more
than it hurts you.

29:37.846 --> 29:40.310
How're ya doin'? Fine. I
was beginning to wonder...

29:40.346 --> 29:44.513
If we'd get it before summer. It's
the last one. Take good care of it.

29:45.013 --> 29:47.514
I don't want to get caught
without a pump during a sandstorm.

29:47.550 --> 29:52.013
We'll be careful. Come on,
jux. Let's get a sweet roll.

30:03.556 --> 30:06.055
Oh!

30:22.556 --> 30:25.057
I thought scud rats
only came out at night.

30:34.057 --> 30:36.099
You're a big, fat, slimy pig.

30:47.099 --> 30:50.099
If you're trying to provoke me,
you'll have to do better than that.

30:50.136 --> 30:53.563
Your mistress is a whore.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.099
Let's get him! No!
Hold it. He's my meat.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.600
Get him! Leave him to me.

31:37.143 --> 31:40.143
- Tark!
- Jux!

31:41.143 --> 31:43.644
Ow! Ow!

32:04.186 --> 32:05.706
Damnil's going to
pay me more for this.

32:07.686 --> 32:10.186
Don't spend it too soon.

32:47.229 --> 32:49.729
Clean up this mess.

32:59.230 --> 33:01.730
It's time we found out
who this man is.

33:06.730 --> 33:09.730
Oh, my god. I didn't
think we could trust him.

33:20.231 --> 33:22.231
Terran had a sword like that.

33:26.773 --> 33:29.272
He must have been
an officer in the guard.

33:29.309 --> 33:32.772
- Probably stole it.
- Perhaps.

33:33.273 --> 33:35.273
He's dangerous, any way you
look at it. I better kill him.

33:35.309 --> 33:39.236
No. Don't do anything yet.

33:39.273 --> 33:42.773
We'll put this in a safe
place and keep an eye on him.

34:04.315 --> 34:06.816
Where did you learn to fight?

34:06.852 --> 34:09.333
I was a soldier.

34:09.371 --> 34:11.779
Will you teach me?

34:11.815 --> 34:14.817
I don't think
that's a good idea.

34:29.817 --> 34:32.817
All right. Come here.

34:42.317 --> 34:44.838
I'll tell you the secret
to being a good fighter,

34:44.875 --> 34:47.360
but you must promise never
to misuse this knowledge.

34:47.859 --> 34:50.322
I promise.

34:50.359 --> 34:52.822
What's the secret?

34:52.860 --> 34:55.860
Before you learn to fight, you
must first learn to meditate.

34:55.896 --> 34:58.860
Meditate? Yeah.

35:06.860 --> 35:08.860
First, draw a triangle.

35:13.361 --> 35:16.860
Put your head here. Hands here.

35:23.361 --> 35:26.361
Put your knees on your elbows.

35:26.860 --> 35:29.403
And then, raise your toes to the sun.

35:33.903 --> 35:36.403
When you master that,
I'll teach you.

36:33.447 --> 36:36.447
What is it? Sounds like
it's near the windmill.

37:01.489 --> 37:03.489
Look!

37:13.991 --> 37:15.990
I brought you breakfast.

37:29.991 --> 37:31.954
You have a healthy appetite.

37:31.991 --> 37:37.496
You're too polite.
I eat like a pig.

37:37.533 --> 37:41.033
I want to thank you
for what you did last night.

37:43.033 --> 37:45.534
You like being
mysterious, don't you?

37:47.033 --> 37:49.533
But I know more about you
than you think I do.

37:50.533 --> 37:54.034
Used to be a soldier.

37:54.533 --> 37:57.034
Probably an officer
of some rank.

37:59.034 --> 38:02.034
And you're here in the valley
for a specific purpose.

38:02.534 --> 38:04.034
And what's that?

38:04.534 --> 38:07.534
It's obviously
not to learn farming.

38:10.535 --> 38:14.034
Well, all that matters is
that you protected the farm.

38:14.070 --> 38:17.576
So I'm gonna trust you
with its secret.

38:17.612 --> 38:20.076
Come with me.

38:34.577 --> 38:37.040
We'll be running
a pipeline down here,

38:37.077 --> 38:40.078
so you're gonna have to know
about this sooner or later.

38:42.078 --> 38:44.078
It's a-torch.

38:54.578 --> 38:58.120
My husband searched
years for this.

38:58.156 --> 39:00.120
I found it just after he died.

40:02.331 --> 40:04.331
It's pure water?

40:13.831 --> 40:16.831
An endless supply of it.

40:23.373 --> 40:25.873
Comes out of the ground
that way.

40:31.874 --> 40:34.874
Let me show you what
I'm gonna do with it.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.374
Will you light that, please?

40:50.874 --> 40:54.338
I'm gonna irrigate
this entire valley.

40:54.374 --> 40:58.374
See, I'm gonna build an aqueduct,
which will cut straight down the middle.

40:58.875 --> 41:01.916
From there, it can branch out
to the individual farms.

41:02.417 --> 41:05.417
Each farm will have
its own source of water.

41:05.916 --> 41:07.417
That's a really-
who thought of this?

41:07.916 --> 41:10.417
I did. It's a really simple.
You did?

41:12.416 --> 41:14.416
All by myself.

41:16.917 --> 41:20.417
How many people
know about this?

41:20.454 --> 41:23.381
Just you and tark.

41:23.417 --> 41:26.917
You do realize the hordes
that are gonna migrate here.

41:27.418 --> 41:30.418
Yes. There's going to be
a new city in meridian.

41:59.460 --> 42:01.460
Ahh.

43:07.546 --> 43:09.547
What's the matter?
Never seen a grown man naked?

43:10.047 --> 43:13.046
You're very cool
for a man in your position.

43:17.047 --> 43:21.047
Let's cut off his balls
and slit open his gut.

43:27.047 --> 43:30.547
You shouldn't play
with sharp objects.

43:30.584 --> 43:33.547
Stand back. Give him room.

43:38.548 --> 43:41.048
- Very pleasant here.
- It was.

43:41.548 --> 43:43.048
You got a lot of guts.

43:43.548 --> 43:47.549
Of course, you realize if I wanted
you killed, you'd be dead by now.

43:49.090 --> 43:51.053
Maybe.

43:51.090 --> 43:54.839
I don't want any trouble.
I just want the land.

43:54.876 --> 43:58.590
My wells are running dry.
I need more water.

44:00.090 --> 44:03.090
Well, perhaps you should
use it more conservatively.

44:04.591 --> 44:06.591
That's for the peasants.

44:07.091 --> 44:10.341
There's more water here
than anyone realizes.

44:10.378 --> 44:14.234
I know it's here.
Eventually, I'll find it.

44:14.270 --> 44:18.091
Whoever controls the water
controls the valley.

44:21.591 --> 44:24.091
I'd like you to work for me.

44:25.091 --> 44:29.091
- Why?
- You're an impressive man.

44:29.592 --> 44:32.633
With you on my side, the peasants
lose heart, give up the fight.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.652
What would they do?
Where will they go?

44:35.688 --> 44:38.910
What does it matter?
They're pig herders.

44:38.947 --> 44:42.290
They squat anywhere.
Their kind always does.

44:42.326 --> 44:45.634
Oh, and uh.
You'll make it worth my while.

44:48.634 --> 44:52.635
Think about it.
Don't think too long.

44:52.671 --> 44:55.097
Work with me, nobody gets hurt.

44:55.134 --> 44:59.135
Turn me down,
a lot of people get hurt.

45:55.220 --> 45:58.220
Oh, no.

47:04.265 --> 47:06.765
? The year of the scud
in double-oh-three?

47:07.265 --> 47:10.228
? And they escaped
from the wars?

47:10.265 --> 47:14.035
? Year of the scud
in double-oh-three?

47:14.072 --> 47:17.770
? Double-oh-three
double-oh-three?

47:17.807 --> 47:23.307
? It was the year of the scud
in double-oh-three?

48:28.351 --> 48:32.352
You're up late.

48:32.852 --> 48:35.852
I was restless.

48:38.852 --> 48:42.394
It's been so long since
I felt safe on the farm.

48:44.393 --> 48:46.894
So, you feel safe now?

48:47.394 --> 48:49.394
Yes.

48:52.394 --> 48:54.895
It's a relief to have
the mill working again.

48:57.395 --> 49:00.395
Do you think
the tubing will hold?

49:00.431 --> 49:02.395
Yes.

49:04.395 --> 49:07.395
Blades aren't too tight?

49:10.895 --> 49:14.359
Are you sure...

49:14.395 --> 49:16.896
That it's gonna be all right?

49:56.272 --> 50:00.772
Do you ever wonder what people were
like before the sandstorms came?

50:00.808 --> 50:04.540
Never lost any sleep over it.

50:04.577 --> 50:08.272
What is it?

50:10.272 --> 50:13.778
Just an old injury.

50:13.814 --> 50:17.314
Turn over. No, it's all right.

50:17.351 --> 50:19.815
Turn... over.

50:33.315 --> 50:36.315
Relax. I know what I'm doing.

50:39.316 --> 50:41.815
I was married to
a soldier once, remember?

50:46.357 --> 50:49.857
You pretend
you never feel any pain.

50:52.358 --> 50:55.358
You think you're...
Invulnerable.

50:58.358 --> 51:00.358
Just like him.

51:02.858 --> 51:05.858
Your husband's dead.

51:05.894 --> 51:07.821
I know.

51:07.858 --> 51:09.822
I buried him.

51:09.859 --> 51:15.858
You should be proud, kasha.
You've done well on your own.

51:15.895 --> 51:17.858
Only because I've had to.

51:39.901 --> 51:42.865
Sun's coming up.

51:42.901 --> 51:45.402
We better get back to the farm.

51:59.902 --> 52:03.402
We can repair the blades. Depends
on what they did to the pump.

52:07.902 --> 52:10.444
Off! Get out here!

52:12.444 --> 52:14.444
What? What?

52:21.445 --> 52:23.445
They did the job well.

52:25.945 --> 52:27.945
Hopeless!

52:40.946 --> 52:44.446
There'll be blood
to pay for this.

52:46.446 --> 52:49.409
- Tark.
- Huh?

52:49.446 --> 52:52.988
How far away in damnil's
farm? I don't know.

52:53.024 --> 52:55.487
Five miles.
Maybe five and a half.

52:58.488 --> 53:00.488
You interested in
a little exercise tonight?

53:02.988 --> 53:04.988
Yeah.

53:22.364 --> 53:25.364
We'll kill them.
Scatter their bodies over the plain.

53:25.400 --> 53:27.327
We'll take the mill-listen.

53:27.364 --> 53:30.364
Don't get carried away. All we
have to do is steal one valve.

53:30.864 --> 53:32.828
Right.

53:32.864 --> 53:34.864
Let's try to do it
as quietly as possible.

54:10.907 --> 54:13.907
Come on. Let's go.

54:35.450 --> 54:36.950
You know, I really liked him.

54:37.451 --> 54:39.131
He was nice, but he was
one of those men...

54:39.451 --> 54:42.951
That like tearing
your clothes off. Yeah.

54:43.450 --> 54:46.450
I tried to tell him, this cost
me three gallons to get this.

54:46.487 --> 54:49.415
Did you charge him extra?

54:49.451 --> 54:51.951
I just want to get drunk.
Well, he was very cute.

55:02.951 --> 55:04.972
Yeah, he says he saw a dog...

55:05.008 --> 55:06.993
On the plain by kasha's farm.

55:07.493 --> 55:09.994
A dog?

55:15.494 --> 55:18.414
There's no way around them, so let's
take them out as quickly as possible.

55:18.494 --> 55:21.744
It only takes a moment
to break a man's neck.

55:21.780 --> 55:24.994
Just do it quietly.
You take the one on the left.

55:29.994 --> 55:31.957
Psst.

55:31.994 --> 55:34.494
Hey. What?

56:02.037 --> 56:04.037
Whoa. Whoa, there.

56:05.538 --> 56:07.501
Whoa. Whoa.

56:07.538 --> 56:11.038
We'll never get across
without them seeing us.

56:42.580 --> 56:45.044
Hurry up. Disconnect the valve.

56:45.080 --> 56:48.080
I need tools. I can't take
it out without breaking it.

56:49.581 --> 56:51.544
We're gonna have to take
the whole pump.

56:51.581 --> 56:54.581
Feel strong? I can carry the
whole damn windmill if I have to.

57:26.624 --> 57:30.088
I'm tired.

57:30.124 --> 57:33.088
Tired? It's early for you.

57:33.124 --> 57:36.124
You got to sleep last night.
Some of us had work to do.

57:36.161 --> 57:38.088
Who says I got to sleep last night?

57:38.124 --> 57:40.624
Oh yeah? What kept you up?

57:40.661 --> 57:42.588
I'm not saying.

57:42.624 --> 57:46.625
But I tell you, old jenkin
should buy his daughter a new cot.

57:47.125 --> 57:48.625
You never touched
jenkin's daughter.

57:49.125 --> 57:53.131
More like it was
one of the old man's pigs.

57:53.167 --> 57:57.167
Hard to tell the two apart
in the dark. You should know.

57:57.204 --> 58:00.667
You boys head off.
Tavern's closed.

58:12.668 --> 58:14.668
Hyah!

58:15.167 --> 58:16.668
Hyah. Hyah.

58:20.668 --> 58:23.668
Hyah! Get! Come on.

58:36.210 --> 58:38.711
Come on. Let's go.

58:56.212 --> 58:56.712
Whoa.

59:09.711 --> 59:11.212
You took your sweet time
with that.

59:11.711 --> 59:14.753
Look at it this way,
we're half way home already.

59:16.253 --> 59:19.253
Well, what happened?

59:19.754 --> 59:21.253
It was that stranger.

59:21.754 --> 59:24.503
He cut through us
like a sandstorm.

59:24.540 --> 59:27.218
I've never seen anyone so fast.

59:27.254 --> 59:30.254
We should have killed him
when he was having his bath.

59:30.754 --> 59:32.718
Let's kill him now.

59:32.754 --> 59:36.255
It's obvious you can't handle
it. We need a professional.

59:36.291 --> 59:38.218
Find sho.

59:38.255 --> 59:40.755
You know where he is.

59:43.254 --> 59:46.254
What've you two
been doing all night?

59:48.755 --> 59:50.718
Where did you get it?

59:50.755 --> 59:54.755
Damnil lent it to us. Took it
right out from under his nose.

59:54.792 --> 59:57.297
You stole
one of damnil's pumps?

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:03.797
Yes.

01:00:07.297 --> 01:00:09.297
That's great.

01:00:11.297 --> 01:00:13.797
- How did you do it?
- Just walked in and took it.

01:00:14.298 --> 01:00:17.298
He must be furious.
That's amazing.

01:00:17.797 --> 01:00:20.261
That's.
That's great. Way to go.

01:00:20.298 --> 01:00:23.298
But wait, I didn't do it alone.
Don't just stand there, tooey.

01:00:23.798 --> 01:00:26.298
Let's go get the man a drink. Oh, yeah.

01:00:27.798 --> 01:00:29.798
I don't believe this.

01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:37.299
On your mark. Get set. Go.

01:00:37.799 --> 01:00:40.341
Sorry.

01:00:57.341 --> 01:01:01.341
You get that one.

01:01:01.377 --> 01:01:03.342
Yes.

01:01:43.884 --> 01:01:48.385
- Can I get a sweet roll?
- Sure, but don't get lost.

01:01:48.421 --> 01:01:50.885
I won't.

01:02:33.429 --> 01:02:35.928
Tark.

01:02:37.429 --> 01:02:39.428
What are you doing here?

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:41.929
Let's go.

01:02:43.971 --> 01:02:46.471
There you go,
telling me what to do again.

01:02:46.507 --> 01:02:48.970
You think you're boss?

01:02:50.971 --> 01:02:52.971
I'm not taking orders
from you anymore.

01:02:53.471 --> 01:02:55.971
I don't take orders
from no one.

01:03:02.471 --> 01:03:04.935
Come on, you pig sticker.

01:03:04.972 --> 01:03:07.471
Come on. I'm not afraid of you.

01:03:07.508 --> 01:03:09.972
I can take a hundred of you.

01:03:12.472 --> 01:03:14.472
Oh, there you go, running away.

01:03:15.972 --> 01:03:17.972
I knew you were a coward.

01:03:26.514 --> 01:03:29.514
You come out of nowhere
and start ruining everything.

01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:32.514
You make her think you're
better than anyone else.

01:03:44.015 --> 01:03:46.514
Oh, I'm no good.

01:03:48.015 --> 01:03:51.015
Probably gonna just
go off somewhere and rot.

01:03:52.015 --> 01:03:54.515
You'll never miss me.

01:03:57.015 --> 01:04:00.516
Nobody wants a worn-out
old soldier anyway.

01:04:00.552 --> 01:04:03.805
What do you think I am?

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:07.058
Come on. Let's go home.

01:04:18.057 --> 01:04:19.558
Here.

01:04:23.558 --> 01:04:25.558
I feel like a rat turd.

01:04:25.594 --> 01:04:27.825
You smell like one.

01:04:27.862 --> 01:04:30.210
What happened to you?

01:04:30.247 --> 01:04:32.558
Oh, nothing, jux.

01:04:33.059 --> 01:04:35.059
He's all right.

01:04:40.058 --> 01:04:42.058
Let's take him
back to the farm.

01:04:42.095 --> 01:04:44.022
You know something?

01:04:44.058 --> 01:04:46.559
You're not so disgusting.

01:04:46.595 --> 01:04:48.564
Oh, you act tough.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.101
No, no. You don't make me puke.

01:04:52.601 --> 01:04:55.601
Thanks.

01:05:10.102 --> 01:05:13.102
Take jux home.

01:05:17.102 --> 01:05:20.102
Go.

01:05:26.602 --> 01:05:30.144
Hey. That's him. That's your man.

01:05:35.144 --> 01:05:37.145
I am sho.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:43.645
- Haven't we met before?
- Not in combat.

01:05:45.645 --> 01:05:47.645
You wear the vest of a guard.

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.645
I was a captain of the elite.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.913
But now you're an assassin.

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:56.108
We all have to make a living.

01:05:56.145 --> 01:05:59.145
Well, it's time
for you to earn it.

01:05:59.181 --> 01:06:02.146
You're very anxious to die.

01:06:03.146 --> 01:06:06.146
You don't even have a sword.
I don't need one.

01:06:07.146 --> 01:06:09.646
Please don't insult me.

01:06:10.646 --> 01:06:13.151
I want this to be sporting.

01:06:13.187 --> 01:06:17.687
I don't suppose any of these peasants
have a sword they can lend you?

01:06:19.687 --> 01:06:23.188
Then we will fight with staves.

01:07:38.274 --> 01:07:40.238
You're very good.

01:07:40.274 --> 01:07:42.775
But I think a little
out of practice.

01:07:42.811 --> 01:07:45.275
We won't know that
till it's over.

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:46.819
Jux, run home.

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:51.819
Stop!

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:19.362
Grab the boy.

01:09:36.863 --> 01:09:38.862
Finish him off. Shut up!

01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:45.404
If you interfere with me again,

01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:47.904
I'll cut your head off.

01:09:59.405 --> 01:10:01.405
The contest isn't over...

01:10:01.441 --> 01:10:03.406
Yet.

01:10:07.406 --> 01:10:09.406
Let's go.

01:10:18.406 --> 01:10:20.427
Tark.

01:10:20.463 --> 01:10:22.448
Tark!

01:10:24.948 --> 01:10:28.449
Tark!

01:10:36.949 --> 01:10:39.949
How could I let this happen?

01:10:40.949 --> 01:10:42.912
It's not your fault.

01:10:42.948 --> 01:10:47.949
If I hadn't pushed damnil, tark would
still be alive and jux would be home safe.

01:10:48.449 --> 01:10:51.449
It's not you. It's me.
I attract violence.

01:10:51.485 --> 01:10:53.967
What are you talking about?

01:10:54.003 --> 01:10:56.449
This has happened before.

01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:00.913
It's not going to happen again.

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:03.449
What are you doing?
I'm going to get jux.

01:11:03.486 --> 01:11:05.492
No. You're crazy.

01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:08.492
You're in no condition
to fight anybody.

01:11:08.528 --> 01:11:10.455
I'll... go to damnil.

01:11:10.492 --> 01:11:12.455
I'll talk to him.
I'll reason with him.

01:11:12.492 --> 01:11:14.992
I know these men, kasha. There's
only one way to reason with them.

01:11:15.028 --> 01:11:16.992
But we can't fight them!

01:11:17.028 --> 01:11:19.260
They have my son.

01:11:19.296 --> 01:11:21.456
They only took jux...

01:11:21.492 --> 01:11:23.992
Because they knew I would come.

01:11:24.028 --> 01:11:26.956
All right.

01:11:26.993 --> 01:11:28.956
If you must go,

01:11:28.992 --> 01:11:30.992
you'll need your sword back.

01:11:43.993 --> 01:11:46.034
Kasha!

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:48.535
Kasha!

01:12:39.579 --> 01:12:41.079
He'll be here.

01:12:41.579 --> 01:12:43.079
Good.

01:12:43.578 --> 01:12:46.079
You're anxious
to get this over with?

01:12:46.115 --> 01:12:48.579
I'm anxious
for different company.

01:12:50.079 --> 01:12:52.042
You don't think much
of me, do you?

01:12:52.079 --> 01:12:56.579
You flatter yourself.
I don't think anything of you.

01:12:58.579 --> 01:13:00.543
You hired me to do a job.

01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:02.580
That's where
your significance ends.

01:13:05.079 --> 01:13:07.080
The rest is me and him.

01:13:38.623 --> 01:13:41.623
Come on. Let's go.

01:13:46.623 --> 01:13:49.623
Mom?

01:13:54.665 --> 01:13:56.665
You're alone.

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:59.129
Where is he?

01:13:59.166 --> 01:14:01.165
Where is the stranger?

01:14:02.165 --> 01:14:04.165
He's gone. He left the valley.

01:14:04.202 --> 01:14:06.629
You lie!

01:14:06.666 --> 01:14:08.666
He wouldn't run.

01:14:11.166 --> 01:14:13.166
Why have you taken my son?

01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:19.215
This whole thing
has gone too far.

01:15:19.252 --> 01:15:22.752
Let's put a stop to it
now. Too late to stop it.

01:15:22.789 --> 01:15:25.216
I can't have you
in the valley anymore.

01:15:25.253 --> 01:15:28.253
Let my son go and we'll
leave. Too late for that too.

01:15:28.289 --> 01:15:30.270
You had your chance to go.

01:15:30.307 --> 01:15:32.530
Why didn't you take it?

01:15:32.566 --> 01:15:34.753
So what are you gonna do,

01:15:35.252 --> 01:15:38.253
murder us both
like you murdered tark?

01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:40.217
No.

01:15:40.253 --> 01:15:44.253
We're not going
to murder anyone.

01:15:44.289 --> 01:15:46.753
He is.

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:54.254
I have something else
you want-water.

01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:56.758
I've seen
your puny little well.

01:15:56.795 --> 01:15:59.794
I know where there's
a freshwater spring-

01:15:59.831 --> 01:16:02.795
an endless supply
of uncontaminated water.

01:16:04.296 --> 01:16:06.259
Where?

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:08.296
Release my son
and I'll tell you.

01:16:14.295 --> 01:16:15.796
Cut the boy's throat.

01:16:19.296 --> 01:16:21.296
No!

01:16:28.296 --> 01:16:30.297
Where is the water?

01:16:36.797 --> 01:16:38.839
It's on my property.

01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:40.839
Where?

01:16:41.338 --> 01:16:43.839
There's a tunnel
in the garden leading to it.

01:16:46.339 --> 01:16:48.339
Now, please,

01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:50.356
let us go.

01:16:50.393 --> 01:16:52.302
Perhaps.

01:16:52.339 --> 01:16:54.340
We'll check the water first.

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:57.802
Please.

01:16:57.839 --> 01:17:00.840
At least let my son live. I've
never seen you crawl before.

01:17:00.876 --> 01:17:02.840
It does my heart good.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.840
Well, enjoy it, you bastard. It may
be the last thing you ever experience.

01:17:08.876 --> 01:17:11.340
Get back!

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.340
Tell him to release my son.

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.360
You'll never get away.

01:17:20.397 --> 01:17:22.346
You better hope I do.

01:17:22.382 --> 01:17:25.382
Otherwise, we'll see
the inside of your throat.

01:17:25.419 --> 01:17:28.382
Tell them.

01:17:29.882 --> 01:17:31.882
Tell them.

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:36.383
Let the boy go.

01:17:42.382 --> 01:17:44.382
Run, jux. Run to town.

01:17:44.883 --> 01:17:46.883
Don't stop and don't look back.

01:17:46.919 --> 01:17:48.883
Go!

01:18:01.425 --> 01:18:03.425
Now it's our turn.

01:18:15.426 --> 01:18:18.426
Nobody sets a foot
outside this tent.

01:18:23.427 --> 01:18:25.926
Get the boy!

01:18:25.963 --> 01:18:28.694
Little bitch.

01:18:28.731 --> 01:18:31.426
Tie her up.

01:18:57.469 --> 01:18:58.969
You take that one
and head him off.

01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:08.433
Come on. After him.

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:10.970
Hurry up. He's getting away.

01:19:41.513 --> 01:19:43.513
He's losing her.

01:20:21.515 --> 01:20:23.598
Get up.

01:20:25.598 --> 01:20:29.098
Hey, let's get the job done.

01:20:30.599 --> 01:20:32.599
Come here, you little bastard.

01:20:37.598 --> 01:20:41.099
- Does damnil want him dead or alive?
- Dead's easy to carry.

01:20:41.135 --> 01:20:43.099
Pick him up.

01:20:52.599 --> 01:20:54.620
We'd better stop him. What?

01:20:54.656 --> 01:20:56.641
Stop him! Come on. Let's go.

01:20:56.678 --> 01:20:58.641
Come on. Come on.

01:21:07.641 --> 01:21:09.605
Come on. Come on.

01:21:09.642 --> 01:21:13.141
Come on. Come on.

01:21:14.642 --> 01:21:16.642
Come on.

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:22.642
Shit. Shit!

01:22:17.185 --> 01:22:20.228
I told you not to play
with sharp objects.

01:22:30.228 --> 01:22:33.229
They've got my mom.
Let's go get her.

01:22:36.729 --> 01:22:38.729
Good boy. Good boy.

01:22:38.765 --> 01:22:40.729
Let's go. Come on.

01:23:08.063 --> 01:23:09.563
Stay here.

01:23:11.563 --> 01:23:14.063
I'll get her, jux.

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:24.563
Get it over
as quickly as possible.

01:24:49.151 --> 01:24:51.650
I knew you wouldn't run.

01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:56.151
This time you brought a sword.

01:24:56.187 --> 01:24:58.693
That's convenient.

01:25:09.193 --> 01:25:11.193
Luck.

01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:13.194
The same.

01:28:43.911 --> 01:28:46.911
Lann, stop them.

01:29:17.953 --> 01:29:19.953
I warned you not to interfere!

01:29:27.454 --> 01:29:29.954
You're the best competition
I've ever had.

01:29:32.955 --> 01:29:35.454
But no one is better than me.

01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:37.454
You talk too much.

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:37.540
Get him.

01:30:37.576 --> 01:30:39.540
Now!

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:54.540
- Leave her.
- She either lives or dies.

01:30:54.577 --> 01:30:57.541
It's up to you.

01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:02.541
Why don't you drop your swords?

01:31:40.584 --> 01:31:42.834
Mom.

01:31:42.871 --> 01:31:45.085
Mom!

01:31:57.127 --> 01:31:58.626
My swords.

01:32:18.128 --> 01:32:20.627
You were a commander.

01:32:22.627 --> 01:32:24.628
Why?

01:32:25.628 --> 01:32:28.091
Why...

01:32:28.128 --> 01:32:32.127
The dried up valley
and a handful of peasants?

01:32:32.164 --> 01:32:36.128
You forget an old man
in a mountain tavern.

01:33:10.671 --> 01:33:12.635
Good morning, sir.

01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:14.672
Good morning. Morning. Morning.

01:33:15.172 --> 01:33:16.672
We've come about the work. Good.

01:33:17.171 --> 01:33:20.714
We're gonna be laying pipes.
Bring water to the whole valley.

01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:23.677
Come with me.

01:33:23.713 --> 01:33:25.713
This is tooey. Hi. Hi.

01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:27.678
He's my helper.

01:33:27.714 --> 01:33:30.714
My brother couldn't come today.
Will there still be work tomorrow?

01:33:30.751 --> 01:33:33.678
Sure. Bring him along.

01:33:33.714 --> 01:33:35.714
I just hope you guys
aren't scared of work.

01:33:36.214 --> 01:33:38.214
We're gonna be
building ourselves a city.

01:33:39.214 --> 01:33:41.214
Just go on over there.

01:33:45.214 --> 01:33:48.178
Gonna miss old tark
on this job.

01:33:48.215 --> 01:33:50.678
He was gonna get me
a couple of pigs.

01:33:50.714 --> 01:33:53.715
Yeah. He sure would have
been proud, wouldn't he?

01:34:21.758 --> 01:34:23.758
You're leaving?

01:34:25.758 --> 01:34:29.258
Damnil's gone. There's not
much more I can do for you.

01:34:32.258 --> 01:34:34.758
You've got your future.

01:34:37.758 --> 01:34:39.925
I don't belong here.

01:34:42.925 --> 01:34:45.389
Somehow...

01:34:45.425 --> 01:34:47.926
I knew you wouldn't stay,

01:34:50.926 --> 01:34:53.925
but I hoped.

01:35:27.844 --> 01:35:29.807
You are...

01:35:29.844 --> 01:35:32.844
The strongest person
I have ever known.

01:35:57.345 --> 01:35:59.345
Build a good city.

01:36:16.387 --> 01:36:18.351
Wait!

01:36:18.387 --> 01:36:20.388
Wait. I'm coming with you.

01:36:25.388 --> 01:36:27.888
You have to teach me
to be a soldier.

01:36:28.388 --> 01:36:30.888
You don't want to be a soldier.

01:36:30.925 --> 01:36:33.388
I want to be like you
and my dad.

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:36.388
No. No, you don't.

01:36:39.388 --> 01:36:41.889
You want to be like jux.

01:36:46.389 --> 01:36:49.159
You help your mother.

01:36:49.196 --> 01:36:51.931
Make this valley green.

01:36:52.931 --> 01:36:55.430
Will you come back?

01:36:59.431 --> 01:37:01.931
When it's time, I'll be there.

01:37:02.932 --> 01:37:04.931
Deal?

01:37:07.931 --> 01:37:09.931
Deal.

01:37:12.432 --> 01:37:14.432
Now, you hurry back.

01:37:15.432 --> 01:37:17.431
You've got a lot of work to do.
