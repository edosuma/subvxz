## Gold fever ##

00:24.040 --> 00:26.027
## Gold fever ##

00:28.629 --> 00:31.232
## Gold fever ##

00:32.298 --> 00:34.802
## I'm changin' things
I'm changin' things ##

00:37.304 --> 00:39.306
## I'm gonna git you, sucka ##

00:39.306 --> 00:41.642
## You dirty mother... ##
Don't say that.

00:41.642 --> 00:45.230
## I'm gonna teach you
that crime just don't pay ##

00:46.732 --> 00:48.817
## I'm gonna git you, sucka ##

00:49.317 --> 00:51.403
## You dirty mother... ##
Hold on, brother.

00:51.403 --> 00:54.490
## I'm gonna stay on your case
till they put you away ##

00:55.992 --> 00:59.561
## I know you think that life's
a bowl of cherries ##

01:01.163 --> 01:04.751
## And you can absolutely
do no wrong ##

01:04.751 --> 01:09.922
## Big brother
a word from the wise
should be sufficient ##

01:10.423 --> 01:14.511
## So I suggest
you pay close attention
to the words to this song ##

01:14.511 --> 01:16.530
## Whoo ##

01:16.530 --> 01:19.099
## Gold fever ##

01:21.185 --> 01:23.686
## Gold fever ##

01:26.273 --> 01:28.258
## Gold fever ##

01:29.860 --> 01:32.396
## I'm changin' things
I'm changin' things ##

01:34.449 --> 01:37.035
## Livin' in the fast lane
beatin' up the street kids ##

01:37.035 --> 01:39.037
## Got plenty money to burn ##
Don't say that.

01:39.537 --> 01:41.623
## World's a game of double cross
till you became the boss ##

01:41.623 --> 01:44.125
## Now it's my turn ##

01:44.125 --> 01:46.378
## Get so we don't agree
menace to society ##

01:46.378 --> 01:48.379
## Smile, yeah, you're on top ##
Wait a minute, Doc.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.632
## 'Cause a smile is just
a frown turned upside down ##

01:51.132 --> 01:53.134
## Get ready for the big drop ##

01:53.134 --> 01:55.805
## 'Cause
I'm gonna git you sucka ##

01:55.805 --> 01:58.307
## You dirty mother... ##
Hey, Doc, Doc.

01:58.307 --> 02:01.460
## I'm gonna stay on your case
till they put you away ####

02:54.032 --> 02:56.536
What do you say, Charlie?
Good evening, lieutenant.

02:56.536 --> 02:59.539
So, what do you got for me?
John Doe.

02:59.539 --> 03:02.041
Between 25 and 30 years of age.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.543
Cause of death looks like O.G.

03:04.543 --> 03:07.547
- "Over gold."
- Yeah.

03:07.547 --> 03:09.549
Any signs of foul play
around here?

03:09.549 --> 03:14.053
No, sir. Looks like a case of
just too many gold chains.

03:23.530 --> 03:25.650
Jesus Christ!

03:25.650 --> 03:29.153
This guy looks like
a fucking statue.

03:29.653 --> 03:33.157
I wonder how he went to the
bathroom with all this stuff on.

03:35.660 --> 03:37.662
Oh, boy.

03:48.925 --> 03:50.927
All right, Charlie.

03:52.427 --> 03:55.431
Why don't we just wrap it up?

03:55.431 --> 03:58.684
All right, wrap it up.

04:02.688 --> 04:04.825
- Friends.
- Yes?

04:04.825 --> 04:08.328
I was thinking as we drove up
here in those long Cadillacs...

04:08.328 --> 04:11.331
- Mm-hmm.
- How serious this is.

04:11.832 --> 04:13.834
- Yes, it is.
- Death is serious.

04:13.834 --> 04:15.837
Yes, it is.

04:15.954 --> 04:18.454
You got to prepare to die.

04:18.454 --> 04:20.457
Yes, yes.

04:20.457 --> 04:24.461
This boy here loved gold.
We stripped him of all that gold.

04:24.461 --> 04:28.466
- That's why we got this
beautiful sermon today.
- Yes, sir.

04:28.850 --> 04:31.602
- He was prepared to die!
- Prepared!

04:32.103 --> 04:35.107
Lord,

04:35.107 --> 04:40.112
We ask you to look down on
this young soul known on Earth...

04:40.112 --> 04:42.114
as Junebug Spade.

04:42.114 --> 04:45.367
Junebug Spade?
Ain't this Lester Wilson's funeral?

04:45.367 --> 04:47.619
No, ma'am.
Lester Wilson was at 9:00.

04:47.987 --> 04:50.489
Oh, hell! Come on,
let's get out of here.

04:50.489 --> 04:52.992
Hold on one second.
No, no. Hold on.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.995
- Can I get an amen?
- Don't even know him.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.497
- Get out of my way!
- Praise the saints?

04:57.497 --> 05:00.000
Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.002
Put that down.

05:07.008 --> 05:09.009
You know Junebug Spade?

05:09.259 --> 05:10.760
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, I'm his mother.

05:11.261 --> 05:13.263
He was my husband.

05:21.272 --> 05:24.776
Mama, I just can't believe that
Junebug didn't have any friends.

05:25.277 --> 05:29.281
Did you notice that not one
person stayed when they
found out it was Junebug?

05:29.281 --> 05:32.783
- Now, baby, you know the boy
wasn't shit.
- Mama!

05:32.783 --> 05:35.787
Don't get me wrong. He was my son,
and I loved him.

05:35.787 --> 05:38.790
But when he got hooked
on that gold, he changed.

05:38.790 --> 05:41.293
I bet he owed everybody
he ever knew money.

05:41.293 --> 05:43.295
Mama, Junebug may have
been a little crooked,

05:43.795 --> 05:46.299
But I'm sure that somebody
besides us loved him too.

05:46.299 --> 05:48.801
I don't know.

05:49.302 --> 05:51.304
Maybe that's Jack.

05:54.807 --> 05:58.311
- Yes?
- Good afternoon, miss lady ma'am.

05:58.311 --> 06:00.313
May we come in?

06:00.313 --> 06:02.815
Y'all ain't selling
NoWay products, are you?

06:03.316 --> 06:06.320
No! We friends
with Junebug.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.822
They're friends of Junebug's, mama.

06:08.822 --> 06:11.325
Come right in.

06:11.325 --> 06:13.327
I'm Cheryl, Junebug's widow,

06:13.827 --> 06:17.332
And this is Mrs. Bell Spade,
Junebug's mother.

06:17.332 --> 06:19.334
Hmm.
What's up?

06:19.334 --> 06:22.337
I'm Willie.
This here's Leonard.

06:22.337 --> 06:26.341
- And we come here...
- What you tell them
our real name for?

06:26.341 --> 06:28.343
Are you stupid?

06:28.343 --> 06:31.846
- No, they told us
their real names, so...
- Who's in charge?

06:32.347 --> 06:34.349
- You are.
- Who?

06:34.349 --> 06:36.352
You in charge.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.854
Then shut the fuck up.

06:38.854 --> 06:41.857
- You all mind telling me
what you want?
- Certainly.

06:42.358 --> 06:44.860
- Junebug used to work for me.
- Used to work for us.

06:45.362 --> 06:47.364
- I work for Mr. Big.
- We work for Mr. Big.

06:47.863 --> 06:51.367
It just so happens
that Junebug died...

06:51.367 --> 06:55.372
- Owing Mr. Big $5,000.
- Five thousand...

06:55.622 --> 06:59.626
- We here to collect.
- Five thousand dollars?

07:00.127 --> 07:02.129
We don't have that kind of money.

07:02.129 --> 07:04.631
No shit.

07:04.631 --> 07:06.634
"No shit"!

07:06.634 --> 07:08.636
They don't have that kind of money!

07:08.636 --> 07:10.638
Get off me!

07:12.639 --> 07:15.643
I could look at these plastic
slipcovers, the slipcovers.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.146
The stupid painted-on walls,
look at this stupid painted...

07:18.646 --> 07:20.648
And tell that type of money
ain't around here.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.651
You see the dude
that painted those walls?
They got doo-doo paint!

07:23.651 --> 07:27.789
It's all bullshit.
Look at these white pillows.
Look at these stupid magazines.

07:27.789 --> 07:31.293
Look, they got oranges and shit!

07:33.295 --> 07:35.298
I'm sorry.

07:36.299 --> 07:39.301
But I do see somethin'.

07:40.802 --> 07:43.805
Somethin' that's gonna
be worth at least...

07:43.805 --> 07:46.809
ten times that amount
of money to Mr. Big.

07:46.809 --> 07:49.429
Well, what is it?
What do you want?

07:49.429 --> 07:51.431
- You.
- Mama!

07:51.431 --> 07:54.934
Don't you touch...

07:54.934 --> 07:56.937
Ooh!

07:56.937 --> 07:58.939
Good. If she moves, hit her again.

07:58.939 --> 08:01.942
- Looks like mama gonna have
to teach you some manners.
- Okay, come on, mama.

08:01.942 --> 08:04.827
You don't ever
come in my house...

08:04.827 --> 08:08.199
Acting like no fool, fool!

08:10.834 --> 08:13.087
Now, clean up that mess you made.

08:13.454 --> 08:16.458
You, put those pillows
back on the couch
where you found 'em.

08:16.458 --> 08:19.461
That's right.
Pick all that shit up!

08:19.461 --> 08:22.964
All of it! And puff
these pillows up too, man.

08:22.964 --> 08:25.218
- You stupid... come here!

08:25.601 --> 08:28.970
Come here! Why you gonna
go mess the nice lady's
house up for, man?

08:29.471 --> 08:33.475
I only did it... you told me
when we came in to beat her up
and mess up her house!

08:33.475 --> 08:35.977
- I didn't tell you shit
like that, man!
- Yes, you did!

08:35.977 --> 08:37.980
Now, mister, you and your
friend got a choice.

08:37.980 --> 08:42.485
You can either go out that
window or take the stairs.

08:42.485 --> 08:44.987
Okay. We gonna take the stairs.
Yeah, we'll take...

08:45.489 --> 08:46.990
Yeah, we'll take the stairs.

08:47.491 --> 08:50.494
Oh! Ow!
Get your pants outta my face!

08:50.494 --> 08:53.412
Oh!
Get off me, man.
Get off me!

08:55.916 --> 08:58.919
- Ma!
- Jack!

08:58.919 --> 09:02.923
- Mama!
- Oh, Lord,
my baby's home at last!

09:02.923 --> 09:06.928
Mama!

09:06.928 --> 09:08.930
My baby's home!
Come on in.

09:09.430 --> 09:12.433
Ma, you okay?
Oh, yes, just some bill
collectors. Cheryl.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.435
Come look who's here.

09:14.936 --> 09:18.940
Oh, honey, you look
so good in this uniform.
All them medals!

09:21.442 --> 09:23.444
You remember Cheryl, don't you?

09:23.695 --> 09:25.698
Hello, Jack.

09:26.081 --> 09:27.583
Hi, Cheryl.

09:30.085 --> 09:32.087
Been a long time, huh?

09:33.088 --> 09:35.342
Yeah, it has been a long time.

09:39.846 --> 09:44.350
Honey, why don't you go
put your things in the room
and have something to eat?

09:44.350 --> 09:48.355
- Cheryl made a fine dinner.
- Mama, that sounds
like a good idea.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.857
And Jack, baby,
Mama wants you to know...

09:50.857 --> 09:53.860
I kept your room just the way
you left it ten years ago.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.365
Oh, ma.

09:57.365 --> 09:59.367
My baby's home.

10:24.643 --> 10:26.646
Right here.

10:26.646 --> 10:29.148
Smells good. It is good.

10:30.650 --> 10:32.652
Mama, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the funeral.

10:32.652 --> 10:35.153
I got here as soon as I could.

10:35.153 --> 10:38.658
I know, baby.
Just glad you're here now.

10:41.160 --> 10:44.664
Mama, exactly how
did Junebug die?

10:44.664 --> 10:46.667
He...

10:46.667 --> 10:49.169
Mama...

10:50.671 --> 10:52.673
She's really
taking this pretty hard.

10:53.173 --> 10:56.678
You know how
your mother is, Jack.

10:56.678 --> 10:58.679
Is somebody gonna tell me
what's going on?

10:58.679 --> 11:01.682
Jack, not too long
after you left,

11:01.682 --> 11:04.184
Junebug started hanging out
with a bad crowd.

11:04.184 --> 11:08.189
I mean, he even started
selling drugs, Jack.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.692
And then things
really got bad when he...

11:12.694 --> 11:14.696
Well, what?

11:16.198 --> 11:18.200
Cheryl, come on.

11:19.201 --> 11:21.704
He started wearing
gold chains, Jack.

11:21.704 --> 11:23.705
Oh, God, no!

11:23.705 --> 11:25.708
It started out
as just one or two.

11:25.708 --> 11:30.212
It seemed like every time
he'd get some money,
he'd buy more gold chains.

11:30.212 --> 11:33.716
He was wearing hundreds
of them, Jack. Hundreds.

11:33.716 --> 11:35.719
Not gold.
Yes, Jack.

11:35.719 --> 11:38.722
Gold chains and medallions
and rings...

11:38.722 --> 11:40.724
And even his teeth.

11:40.724 --> 11:43.727
You can't imagine what it was
like to kiss him.

11:43.727 --> 11:46.731
He took a picture
just before he died.

11:48.231 --> 11:50.233
We put it on the mantle.

11:59.494 --> 12:01.496
Junebug!

12:02.497 --> 12:06.001
How did he go to the bathroom
with all this stuff on?

12:07.002 --> 12:09.004
Okay.

12:09.004 --> 12:12.007
All right, who are these people
Junebug was hanging out with?

12:13.007 --> 12:15.009
Well,

12:15.511 --> 12:18.013
He worked for a man
named Mr. Big.

12:18.013 --> 12:20.516
He rules the crime world here.

12:20.516 --> 12:24.520
- Those men that your mother
threw down the stairs?
- They work for Mr. Big too.

12:24.520 --> 12:28.024
They came in here
saying that Junebug owed 'em
all kinds of money, crazy money.

12:28.024 --> 12:31.027
And I really think that they're
the ones who killed him.

12:31.027 --> 12:33.530
Well, don't you worry
about a thing.

12:33.530 --> 12:36.033
Jack Spade is here, and I'm
gonna get to the bottom of this.

12:36.033 --> 12:38.034
Oh.

12:38.535 --> 12:41.788
I better go check on mama.

12:44.657 --> 12:47.661
- Where is the girl?
- we almost had the girl, Mr. Big.

12:47.661 --> 12:49.663
Yeah, we almost.
She's beautiful.

12:49.663 --> 12:52.666
She's gonna be worth far more
than the money Junebug owes.

12:52.666 --> 12:55.169
She'll be worth
maybe 10 or 20 times.
Far more than money.

12:55.169 --> 12:59.174
Anyway, she's got a real soft
juicy fruit butt.

12:59.174 --> 13:02.177
But the only problem
was that this old lady,

13:02.177 --> 13:04.178
She punched me in the stomach
real hard!

13:04.678 --> 13:07.182
Then she started crying
and screaming and stuff,
right?

13:07.682 --> 13:09.184
And a dude came in,
this big dude.

13:09.684 --> 13:11.686
- I think it's her son or something.
- What dude?

13:12.187 --> 13:13.688
- The soldier dude.
- I didn't see him.

13:14.189 --> 13:16.692
The dude.
The fucking dude that came in!

13:16.692 --> 13:20.196
- Then he started...
He hit me from behind.
- He hit you?

13:20.196 --> 13:22.198
- And I went down.
- Oh, you mean the soldier dude!

13:22.582 --> 13:25.084
- Yeah, the soldier dude.
- Okay, okay.

13:25.084 --> 13:28.588
Then he hit me from behind.
And I went down.
I was like this.

13:29.088 --> 13:31.707
- Then the dude shot me!
- He didn't shoot you.

13:31.707 --> 13:34.210
He did. Kept on
biting on my ankles.

13:34.210 --> 13:37.214
- Where did you get
a stupid lie like that from?
- Enough.

13:37.214 --> 13:40.217
Now,

13:40.217 --> 13:42.219
Junebug worked under you,

13:42.219 --> 13:45.188
Which means you
owe me his debts.

13:45.439 --> 13:48.443
If that girl is anything
you say she is,

13:48.443 --> 13:50.445
Then we'll call it even.

13:50.445 --> 13:54.448
I have no patience
when it comes to collecting.

13:56.434 --> 13:58.403
Now, I suspect...

13:58.403 --> 14:00.905
You'll bring me that girl
right away.

14:00.905 --> 14:04.909
Yes, sir, uncle Mr. Big.
Yes, sir, Mr. Big.

14:05.911 --> 14:08.914
Uncle Mr. Big, I have a question.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.916
What about the mother?

14:13.419 --> 14:16.423
If he gets in your way,
kill him.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.425
I better not hear any more
about that guy...

14:19.425 --> 14:21.427
Or it's your asses!

14:21.427 --> 14:23.429
You got that?

14:23.429 --> 14:25.932
Yes, sir, uncle Mr. Big.
It'll be our asses.
It'll be your ass.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.934
Good.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.439
You boys can leave
either through the window...

14:33.940 --> 14:35.943
or the stairs.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.946
We'll take the stairs.
We always take the stairs.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.948
- Lenny?
- What?

14:40.948 --> 14:44.951
- You mad at me?
- I'm gonna be mad on the way
down these stairs.

14:47.088 --> 14:49.090
Ooh! Ow!

14:49.090 --> 14:51.092
Ooh! Ooh!
Oh!

14:51.459 --> 14:53.461
He was such a sweet baby.

14:53.461 --> 14:56.465
I don't know how he
turned out so bad.

14:58.967 --> 15:01.970
He missed you
when you was gone, Jack.

15:01.970 --> 15:03.972
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:03.972 --> 15:05.975
I missed him too, mama.

15:06.476 --> 15:10.979
You know, I remember
when me and Junebug
used to go to the park.

15:10.979 --> 15:13.482
Junebug loved the swings.

15:13.482 --> 15:15.985
He'd say, "Jack, give me a push."

15:16.486 --> 15:18.988
And I'd take him and run,
but I wouldn't push him.

15:18.988 --> 15:21.991
I'd run back in,
then I'd run again.
Still wouldn't push him.

15:21.991 --> 15:25.996
Shut up, Jack!
Do you remember this?

15:25.996 --> 15:30.000
Do you remember when you
made that for mama?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.503
I made this
in Mrs. Wilson's class.

15:33.003 --> 15:36.006
That's right.
You was always so thoughtful
to your mama.

15:36.507 --> 15:40.010
- That's why I'm so glad
you're home.
- Mama.

15:40.010 --> 15:43.514
W-wait a minute.
What?

15:44.014 --> 15:46.017
Mama!

15:46.017 --> 15:48.520
That's John Slade.
Yeah?

15:49.020 --> 15:50.522
I didn't know you knew him.

15:51.022 --> 15:54.025
Yes. We was very much
in love once.

15:54.025 --> 15:56.028
Before I met your father.

15:56.529 --> 15:58.530
I almost married Slade.

15:59.030 --> 16:02.033
But he was so busy
being a crime fighter,

16:02.033 --> 16:05.537
Flying in and out of windows,
chasing criminals.

16:06.038 --> 16:08.541
Hmm. Had no time to settle down.

16:08.541 --> 16:12.545
Anyway, wish he was here now.

16:12.545 --> 16:15.047
He'd find out what happened to
my boy and he'd make 'em pay.

16:15.548 --> 16:17.050
Hey, mama, now.

16:17.551 --> 16:20.554
Mama, I'm here, and I'm gonna
find out what happened to Junebug.

16:21.054 --> 16:23.056
No, no, no, no.

16:23.056 --> 16:26.560
You're all I got!
Don't you do nothing foolish.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.562
I'm just gonna ask
a few questions, that's all.

16:29.062 --> 16:32.065
- No, Jack.
- Ma, just a few questions.
I promise.

16:33.567 --> 16:35.569
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:35.569 --> 16:37.572
Okay.

16:37.572 --> 16:39.574
- Be careful.
- I will.

16:52.804 --> 16:56.308
"John Slade to host
youth gang competition."

16:56.425 --> 17:00.429
2:00.
- Hey, move it!
- Can I get a cab?

17:15.444 --> 17:17.446
I want this shit clean.

17:17.696 --> 17:22.702
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!

17:30.594 --> 17:32.963
It's a new record!

17:52.484 --> 17:56.489
Right now I'd like to talk
to a man who's no stranger
to this community.

17:56.489 --> 17:59.992
And he's considered by many to
be, well, a local hero of sorts.

17:59.992 --> 18:04.496
While serving the community
in the '70s, he helped topple
such crime bosses as Mr. Big.

18:04.496 --> 18:06.499
He's responsible
for today's events.

18:06.499 --> 18:10.002
I'm speaking, of course,
of Mr. John Slade.

18:10.002 --> 18:14.507
A lot of people would like to
see you come back and help rid
the old neighborhood of Mr. Big.

18:14.507 --> 18:18.512
- How do you respond to that?
- No, skip. I'm sorry.
I'm retired now.

18:19.012 --> 18:21.014
It's a job for
the police department.

18:21.014 --> 18:24.518
Oh, but tell us, Mr. Slade,
what is today really about?

18:24.518 --> 18:28.022
To provide for these young
people an opportunity
to let steam off...

18:28.022 --> 18:30.524
In a very positive way...

18:30.524 --> 18:34.027
By competing in events that
are familiar, if you will,

18:34.027 --> 18:36.531
to their environment.

18:36.531 --> 18:38.533
Do you know
what I mean, brother?

18:38.533 --> 18:41.035
Well, actually, I don't.
I didn't grow up around blacks.

18:41.035 --> 18:44.038
I grew up in the suburbs.
My dad was a lawyer.
My mom was a doctor.

18:44.539 --> 18:46.041
All my friends were white.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.044
Everybody used to tease me
'cause I didn't speak jive.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.046
I couldn't dance
to save my life.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.549
The only step I really knew was
that step that Springsteen does...

18:54.048 --> 18:56.050
In the "Dancing in the Dark"
video.

18:56.050 --> 18:59.555
I love Springsteen.
Yes.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.558
Reporting for WBLD news,
this is Skip Balins saying,

19:02.558 --> 19:06.061
in the immortal words of our
negro poet, Don Cornelius,

19:06.061 --> 19:08.565
"Peace and soul."

19:08.565 --> 19:10.567
Thanks, guys.

19:14.704 --> 19:17.208
- John Slade?
- Yeah.

19:17.208 --> 19:19.209
I need to talk to you.

19:19.209 --> 19:21.711
- You sellin' NoWay products?
- No.

19:21.711 --> 19:23.713
Oh, okay.

19:23.713 --> 19:27.218
- Can we go somewhere
more private?
- Yeah. This way.

19:27.218 --> 19:29.720
Senior Citizen Mugging
Competition...

19:29.971 --> 19:32.974
will begin in five minutes.

19:32.974 --> 19:35.977
Okay, young man.
What can I do for you?

19:38.981 --> 19:42.484
- Do you remember that woman?
- Yeah, I sure do.

19:42.484 --> 19:44.986
That's Bell Brown.

19:44.986 --> 19:48.991
We used to call her
"hot chocolate."
She had the softest eyes.

19:49.992 --> 19:55.497
She had these big old
round, brown, firm ti...

19:55.497 --> 19:59.002
She would do this
little trick with her mouth
where she would...

19:59.502 --> 20:01.371
That's my mother, man.

20:01.371 --> 20:03.873
She was a good woman,
your mother. Yes, she was.
Absolutely, a good woman.

20:03.873 --> 20:06.377
I should have married
your mother.

20:06.377 --> 20:09.379
Wait a minute. You ain't gonna
tell me I'm your daddy or no
shit like that now...

20:09.379 --> 20:11.381
because I don't wanna
hear no bullshit.

20:11.764 --> 20:14.267
No. Nothin' like that.

20:14.267 --> 20:16.270
That's my brother.

20:16.270 --> 20:19.773
He's dead. He O.G.'d.

20:20.274 --> 20:23.277
How does he go to the bathroom
with all this shit on?

20:23.777 --> 20:25.279
Look, I'm sorry
about your brother...

20:25.779 --> 20:29.784
And I'm really sorry for Bell
because she don't deserve it.

20:31.286 --> 20:33.288
Look at this.

20:33.288 --> 20:35.789
I bought that on the street.

20:35.789 --> 20:39.294
You know what that shit
is doing to our kids?
I know. I'm from the streets.

20:39.661 --> 20:44.165
Every day I see kids
walking around killing
and stealing for gold chains.

20:44.165 --> 20:46.669
I see kids with medallions
so big they can hardly stand up.

20:47.169 --> 20:50.172
All stooped over and shit,
trying to carry that stuff.

20:50.172 --> 20:53.175
But what's really awful, man,
is you see a young brother...

20:53.175 --> 20:57.180
with this cheap, imitation
electroplated gold crap
around their necks,

20:57.180 --> 20:59.682
and it breaks out
in this funky green rash...

20:59.682 --> 21:01.684
with these bumps and shit.

21:01.684 --> 21:04.186
It just make you wanna puke.

21:04.186 --> 21:08.692
Yeah. Yeah,
I know it's happenin'.
What do you want with me?

21:08.692 --> 21:10.694
I want you...

21:10.694 --> 21:13.697
to take down Mr. Big and put
an end to this gold-chain shit.

21:13.697 --> 21:17.702
Hey, look, I'm sorry about your
brother. I'm sorry for Bell.

21:17.702 --> 21:20.204
But I don't wanna be
no hero no more, man.

21:20.204 --> 21:23.708
- I'm a long way from that.
- Yeah, and look what happened.

21:23.708 --> 21:27.211
- The people need you.
- The people need me?

21:27.211 --> 21:29.714
It was the people, man,
that made me retire.

21:29.964 --> 21:33.468
The people said
I was too violent,
a bad image for the kids.

21:33.468 --> 21:36.472
So fuck the people.
The people...

21:36.472 --> 21:39.475
Look, I'm retired now,
okay?

21:39.475 --> 21:42.478
And I kind of enjoy
the feeling of staying alive.
Okay, brother?

21:42.978 --> 21:47.484
I was one of those kids
that looked up to you, man.
I believed in you.

21:47.484 --> 21:50.486
I wanted to be like you.

21:52.488 --> 21:54.490
You were the best.

22:17.515 --> 22:19.517
Hello!

22:20.768 --> 22:22.770
Hello?

22:22.770 --> 22:25.272
Is anybody here?

22:25.272 --> 22:27.776
Yes, my brother.

22:27.776 --> 22:29.778
How may I help you?

22:29.778 --> 22:33.782
Yeah, are you Kalinga, leader of
the people's revolutionary army?

22:33.782 --> 22:36.284
- Are you C.I.A.?
- No.

22:36.284 --> 22:39.788
- I am Kalinga.
- I need to talk to you.

22:39.788 --> 22:42.791
Have a seat.
Would you care for
something to eat?

22:42.791 --> 22:44.793
A bean pie perhaps?

22:44.793 --> 22:46.796
No, uh, I'm not hungry.

22:46.796 --> 22:50.800
Something to drink?
Please sit down.
Herb tea? A soda?

22:50.800 --> 22:52.802
Okay, soda's fine.

22:57.057 --> 23:00.561
Articulate your needs.
I'm here to listen.

23:00.561 --> 23:02.563
How may I help you?

23:02.563 --> 23:05.064
Well, first of all...

23:08.202 --> 23:11.705
It's an acquired taste.

23:11.705 --> 23:15.209
Now... How may I help you,
my brother?

23:15.209 --> 23:18.213
Look, I'm here because
I can't stand what's happening
in this community.

23:18.213 --> 23:20.715
- Yes!
- And somebody has to
make a change.

23:21.216 --> 23:22.217
- Yes!
- Brother, will you help me?

23:22.717 --> 23:24.719
Yes! Well...

23:25.720 --> 23:27.723
I wish I could.

23:27.723 --> 23:31.726
Damn it, man. I heard
the people's revolutionary army
was once a thousand strong.

23:31.726 --> 23:35.230
- Now, what happened?
- They got government jobs.

23:37.233 --> 23:38.734
What?

23:39.235 --> 23:41.737
You know that government office
building on 25th street?

23:42.238 --> 23:45.241
- Yeah?
- We went down to take it over.

23:45.241 --> 23:48.745
But they were hiring that day.

23:49.112 --> 23:51.114
The brothers
walked in with guns...

23:52.616 --> 23:55.618
and came out with jobs.

23:55.618 --> 23:58.121
The brothers
weren't mad anymore.

23:58.121 --> 24:01.124
Yes.

24:01.625 --> 24:04.127
Whitey...
Is something else.

24:08.633 --> 24:10.134
Damn.

24:10.635 --> 24:14.639
My great nubian warrior,
dinner's ready.

24:14.772 --> 24:17.276
We have a guest.
Meet my Ofay Wench.

24:20.778 --> 24:24.282
Uh, nice to meet you.
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

24:24.398 --> 24:27.903
She makes the best bean dishes
in all the world.

24:28.287 --> 24:32.291
Daddy!
Daddy, can we watch TV?

24:32.291 --> 24:36.295
Daddy, oh, brave black king,
I finished my homework.

24:36.663 --> 24:39.165
Can we watch TV?

24:39.165 --> 24:42.669
Let me hear... Your report.

24:42.669 --> 24:47.173
Okay. "Abraham Lincoln was
born in a log cabin in Illinois.

24:47.173 --> 24:49.676
"This poor white trash
went on to become...

24:50.176 --> 24:52.178
"the president

24:52.178 --> 24:56.065
- Yes?
- "Once in office, this white

- Swine!
- "Manipulated the freedom

24:59.186 --> 25:01.188

- "till another piece

25:05.192 --> 25:07.696
Shot him in the head.
The end."

25:07.696 --> 25:10.197
- Whoo!

25:10.197 --> 25:12.199
Thank you, Jesus.

25:14.702 --> 25:16.705
Whitey,

25:16.705 --> 25:18.707
I am very pleased.

25:18.707 --> 25:21.710
Yes, you and your lovely sister,

25:21.710 --> 25:25.096
You may go and watch TV.

25:25.096 --> 25:27.099
Go and enjoy.

25:30.102 --> 25:32.104
Are you sure, my brother,

25:32.605 --> 25:34.106
You will not join us?

25:34.606 --> 25:36.608
- No.
- Oh, bean ice cream.

25:38.110 --> 25:40.112
Thanks, I'm regular.

25:40.613 --> 25:43.616
Look, I gotta be going, man.
Thanks.

25:43.616 --> 25:45.618
Struggle!

25:45.618 --> 25:47.571
Power to the people!

I'll bring it to you ##

25:55.295 --> 25:57.799
## With a wave, you'll
make it just like new ##

25:58.299 --> 26:00.300
Hi, soldier boy.
How you doing?

26:00.417 --> 26:02.919
What can I get for you?

26:04.421 --> 26:06.423
Just a soda.

26:09.927 --> 26:11.929
I came to pick you up.
You gettin' off soon?

26:14.932 --> 26:17.936
I was just waiting for ma
to come and take me home.

26:17.936 --> 26:19.938
She's probably had a long day.

26:20.439 --> 26:22.441
Call and tell her I'm here.

26:22.941 --> 26:25.943
Okay. I'll be back in a minute.

26:37.290 --> 26:40.293
You Jack Spade?

26:40.293 --> 26:43.797
Yeah, I'm Jack... Spade.

26:43.797 --> 26:48.803
We hear you been asking
a lot of questions
around town about Mr. Big.

26:48.803 --> 26:50.804
Mr. Big don't like it.

26:50.804 --> 26:53.807
- Jack.
- Come here, Cheryl.

26:53.807 --> 26:56.309
Don't you worry about a thing.
I can handle this.

26:56.309 --> 26:59.814
Only thing you're gonna
be able to handle, soldier boy,
is a wheelchair.

26:59.814 --> 27:02.316
- Jack, no!
- Oh, yeah.

27:02.316 --> 27:04.318
Yeah.

27:07.322 --> 27:10.325
Hold it right there.
Ain't nobody layin' a finger
on my baby.

27:10.325 --> 27:12.327
Ma!

27:16.580 --> 27:18.583
How did you do that?

27:39.106 --> 27:41.607
You know, ma, you really didn't
have to do that.

27:42.108 --> 27:43.609
That was my fight.

27:44.110 --> 27:47.614
That's all right, sugar.
Mama don't want her baby
fightin' that street trash.

27:47.614 --> 27:50.617
Come on, let's go home.
Put your jacket on, Jack.
Put the jacket on.

27:50.617 --> 27:53.620
Put your jacket on.
It's cold outside.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.622
Come on. Move.

28:04.681 --> 28:07.685
Look, ma,
I'm not a boy anymore.
I'm a man.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.189
My whole life,
every time I get in a fight,
here you come.

28:11.189 --> 28:14.192
I don't need you
to fight for me no more.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.697
All right,
Mr. Tough Guy.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.202
I remember when you
wasn't so tough.

28:23.202 --> 28:27.707
I remember when you was always
calling for your mama!

28:27.707 --> 28:31.710
Like the time when
that Lois Mitchell girl
was kicking your ass...

28:31.710 --> 28:34.213
Up and down, up and down
the schoolyard!

28:34.213 --> 28:37.717
All I could hear was,
"Mama! Mama!"

28:37.717 --> 28:41.221
Oh, yeah, and the time
when that Evans family,
those little midgets,

28:41.588 --> 28:44.090
Was chasing you home
'cause you didn't want to
give them your lunch money.

28:44.591 --> 28:48.095
I could hear your punk ass
calling me a half a mile away.

28:48.095 --> 28:51.098
"Mama, help me!
Mama, help me!"

28:51.098 --> 28:53.601
Now you don't need me
no more, huh?

28:53.601 --> 28:55.602
Fine.

28:55.602 --> 29:00.107
You don't never
have to worry about me
fighting for you no more.

29:00.107 --> 29:02.109
- Good.
- Now what you gonna do?

29:02.109 --> 29:04.111
Finish the fight Big started.

29:04.111 --> 29:07.115
- Don't be no fool.
They'll kill you, Jack!
- Maybe.

29:07.115 --> 29:09.618
Jack!

29:13.622 --> 29:16.625
Slade.

29:17.126 --> 29:20.629
How you doin', Bell?
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

29:21.129 --> 29:24.633
I need you. I really need you.

29:24.633 --> 29:27.136
I've been pretty horny
myself lately.

29:27.637 --> 29:31.140
That's a gun.
Jack, what are you doing
with a gun?

29:31.140 --> 29:33.142
I'm in the army,
remember?

29:33.142 --> 29:37.147
- Mama's right.
They're gonna kill you.
- Mr. Big is gonna pay.

29:37.147 --> 29:41.151
And if I see
those little Evans midgets,
they ass is mine!

29:41.151 --> 29:43.654
I'm... it's payback.
And Lois Mitchell.

29:43.654 --> 29:45.655
You know, she snuck me.
She snuck me.

29:45.655 --> 29:48.659
In fifth grade...
I was eating my jell-o
when you hit me, baby.

29:48.659 --> 29:50.661
They were just kids!

29:50.661 --> 29:54.665
A family full of midgets
is not considered kids.
That's a gang!

29:54.665 --> 29:59.170
Jack, wait a minute.
Getting yourself killed
is not gonna prove anything.

29:59.170 --> 30:01.673
Proves I can beat a woman
and some midgets.

30:01.923 --> 30:04.426
He's gonna get himself killed.

30:05.927 --> 30:07.930
How ya doing, Jack?

30:10.432 --> 30:12.934
Slade, please.
Please stop him.
He's all I got left.

30:13.435 --> 30:15.687
Don't worry, Bell.
I'll take care of him.

30:19.692 --> 30:21.193
Jack.

30:21.193 --> 30:24.196
Jack, where the hell
do you think you're going?

30:24.196 --> 30:26.198
To war.
You mean to get killed.

30:26.198 --> 30:29.202
Look, I came to you for help.
You don't want to help me, cool.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.205
But don't try to stop me
from doin' what I gotta do,
okay?

30:32.205 --> 30:34.707
You go out there alone,
they gonna shoot your ass off.

30:34.707 --> 30:38.211
- I'm a soldier, man.
I've been trained for combat.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.216
Oh, my god!
Heads up!

30:43.216 --> 30:46.219
Be cool!
They shootin'!

30:46.219 --> 30:48.222
They shootin'!
Somebody shootin'!

30:48.222 --> 30:52.226
Get down!
Get your ass down, boy!

30:52.226 --> 30:54.729
I thought you were
trained for combat.

30:54.729 --> 30:58.233
Yeah. Yeah, I was,
but I ain't never been in it.

30:58.233 --> 31:00.735
What are these
fancy medals for?

31:00.735 --> 31:03.621
Well, this one is shorthand.

31:04.122 --> 31:06.624
And this one here's M.P.V.

31:06.624 --> 31:09.128
- And, uh, this is surfin'.
- Never mind. Never mind.

31:09.128 --> 31:11.130
- You got your weapon?
- Yeah.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.632
Give it to me.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.635
Give me a clip.

31:16.635 --> 31:18.638
Hurry up, Jack.

31:18.638 --> 31:20.640
- Ma'am, how is he?
- He's dead.

31:21.141 --> 31:23.643
Can't you hear the music?

31:26.645 --> 31:28.648
Ma'am?

31:28.648 --> 31:31.151
- I waited 12 years for this.
- Let me see.

31:31.518 --> 31:34.521
Not bad.
At least he wasn't cheap.

31:34.904 --> 31:37.408
I'm sure he won't mind.

31:48.420 --> 31:51.789
Jack, go now!

31:58.547 --> 32:00.549
Go that way.

32:01.049 --> 32:03.051
I'll go this way.

32:07.557 --> 32:10.059
Cover the door.
They're comin' up.

32:10.059 --> 32:12.562
- Where are you goin'?
- Comin' around the corner.
Cover the door.

32:13.062 --> 32:15.063
They're comin' out!

32:18.701 --> 32:21.204
Here, take it!

32:25.324 --> 32:27.326
Cover me! Cover me!

32:32.716 --> 32:36.220
Don't do this, man!

32:36.336 --> 32:38.840
Who is it?

32:40.340 --> 32:43.343
Come on, come on.
Against the wall, punk.

32:43.343 --> 32:46.346
Hold it!
It's over, it's over.

32:46.346 --> 32:50.852
Now, who are you guys
and why are you trying
to kill us?

32:50.852 --> 32:53.855
What, you think
it's that easy?
You think it's that easy?

32:53.855 --> 32:57.358
You just ask us,
and we tell you, right?
We supposed to tell you?

32:57.358 --> 32:59.361
Shit.
That's funny.

32:59.361 --> 33:01.864
You're gonna have to
kill him first.

33:01.864 --> 33:04.867
Why you gonna
kill me first, Lenny?

33:05.366 --> 33:08.871
You guys talk a lot of shit
to be so light in the ass.

33:08.871 --> 33:12.875
- Uh, uncle Mr. Big
told us to kill him.
- why does Big want me dead?

33:13.125 --> 33:15.127
The word's on the street
you been sticking your nose
in business that's not yours.

33:15.628 --> 33:17.631
You're sticking
your nose in it.

33:17.631 --> 33:19.633
And you, Mr. Whoever You Are.
Whoever you are.

33:19.633 --> 33:22.636
The same is gonna happen to you
when Mr. Big finds out
what you did tonight.

33:22.769 --> 33:25.772
Well, you know what?
You guys are real lucky.

33:25.889 --> 33:28.392
I'm in a good mood tonight,
so I'm gonna let you go, okay?

33:28.392 --> 33:31.895
- I thought so.
- Hey, Lenny, wait a minute.

33:32.395 --> 33:36.399
Why were you gonna let us go
when we was just over there
trying to kill you?

33:36.399 --> 33:39.403
Stupid.
What do you care why?

33:39.904 --> 33:41.906
- Let's just go.
- Look.

33:41.906 --> 33:44.408
You tell Mr. Big...

33:44.408 --> 33:46.911
that John Slade is back.

33:46.911 --> 33:49.915
He's got 24 hours
to get outta town.

33:50.415 --> 33:52.918
Now, you guys can either
go over the side...

33:52.918 --> 33:54.920
- Or you can ...
- Yeah, we'll take the stairs.

33:55.419 --> 33:57.923
Yeah, I thought you knew.
Come on. Let's go.
Go on. Shut up.

33:58.056 --> 34:00.559
Fucking get off me, man.

34:00.559 --> 34:03.061
Come on.

34:03.061 --> 34:05.063
Go ahead.

34:09.068 --> 34:12.071
When they get back to Big,
it's gonna get rough.

34:12.071 --> 34:14.574
You better score
some big guns.

34:19.029 --> 34:22.532
## When the saints ##

34:23.533 --> 34:26.034
## Go marchin' in ##

34:27.538 --> 34:29.540
## When the saints ##

34:29.540 --> 34:34.545
## Go marchin' in ##

34:34.545 --> 34:36.547
Do that march, baby.

34:36.547 --> 34:38.550
## I wanna be, uh ##

34:39.050 --> 34:41.553
## In that number ##
How you doing, brother man?

34:41.553 --> 34:43.554
- May I help you gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

34:43.554 --> 34:45.556
We wanna see one-eyed Sam.

34:45.556 --> 34:48.560
You ain't selling
any NoWay products,
are you?

34:48.560 --> 34:50.562
We look like salesmen
to you?

34:50.562 --> 34:52.563
He ain't here, okay?

34:52.563 --> 34:55.567
You call him on the phone
and you tell him
that John Slade...

34:56.067 --> 34:57.569
has got to score tonight.

34:58.070 --> 35:01.073
Yeah, Okay. John Slade.

35:01.073 --> 35:03.576
I'll get his line
here for you.

35:04.076 --> 35:07.079
## Refuses to shine ##

35:07.079 --> 35:10.083
Sam, sorry to wake you.

35:10.583 --> 35:14.587
Two big ugly-looking guys,
one guy who thinks
he's at sea world.

35:16.088 --> 35:18.592
This other guy named Slade.

35:18.592 --> 35:21.595
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Slade says he
needs a big score.

35:23.597 --> 35:26.600
Okay. Later.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.103
Uh, Slade, Slade.

35:29.103 --> 35:31.105
I-I'm sorry about that.

35:31.489 --> 35:35.993
Sam says he'll be right over
and for me to get you guys
a drink on the house.

35:35.993 --> 35:39.497
- Enjoy the show.
Sorry about that, man.
- No problem.

35:39.497 --> 35:41.499
All right.

35:42.500 --> 35:46.504
## When the saints ##

35:47.005 --> 35:51.510
## Go mar-wa-wa-waah ##

35:51.510 --> 35:55.014
## Saints ##
Hi, can I get you fellas
something to drink?

35:55.014 --> 35:58.518
Yes, baby, give me
a whiskey double, okay?

35:58.518 --> 36:00.519
One whiskey double.
And?

36:00.519 --> 36:03.889
Um, I'll have a Pepsi double.

36:04.390 --> 36:07.927
One whiskey double
and one Pepsi coming right up.

36:08.428 --> 36:12.899
## Be in that number ##

36:13.400 --> 36:16.903
## When the saints ##

36:16.903 --> 36:18.906
## Go marchin' in ##

36:18.906 --> 36:22.410
## I-i-i-in, whoo ##

36:22.410 --> 36:25.912
## Will you be there with me
I'm asking, will you
be there with me ##

36:25.912 --> 36:29.917
- Who is that?
- That's the director's sister.

36:41.263 --> 36:44.766
- One whiskey double.
- Thank you.

36:44.766 --> 36:47.770
and a... Pepsi double.

36:50.272 --> 36:52.774
You've got some things to learn
about being a hero.

36:53.275 --> 36:54.776
Like what?

36:55.277 --> 36:56.778
I mean, a Pepsi?

36:57.279 --> 37:00.783
- Jack, come on.
- Wh-what's wrong with Pepsi?

37:00.783 --> 37:02.785
When's the last time
you been laid?

37:02.785 --> 37:04.787
- What?
- You heard what I said.

37:05.288 --> 37:07.290
Uh, well, not ...

37:07.791 --> 37:09.293
Been a while, hasn't it?

37:09.293 --> 37:13.297
Yeah, okay, so ...
So yeah, all right.
So it's been a while.

37:13.297 --> 37:16.299
But that's only 'cause
I'm waiting on somebody ...

37:16.299 --> 37:18.302
Waiting on somebody special.

37:18.302 --> 37:20.804
Somebody special.
You got a lot to learn.

37:20.804 --> 37:23.807
You gotta learn the difference
between being loved...

37:23.807 --> 37:25.776
and being laid.

37:25.776 --> 37:29.731
Now, when I was with your mom ...
When I was with your mom,

37:29.731 --> 37:32.200
That was being loved.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.203
But you see down at the end
of the bar there?

37:35.703 --> 37:38.207
That is for being laid.

37:43.078 --> 37:46.581
I ...
She's comin' over here!

37:46.581 --> 37:48.584
Be cool. Loosen up.

37:48.584 --> 37:51.587
Let her do the talking.

37:57.093 --> 38:02.099
Hi. My name's Cherry.

38:02.099 --> 38:04.601
What's yours?

38:04.601 --> 38:07.603
- Jack.
- Jack.

38:07.603 --> 38:10.574
That's such
a strong-sounding name.

38:10.574 --> 38:12.576
Jack.

38:13.076 --> 38:15.078
Do you find me attractive?

38:15.078 --> 38:19.083
Oh, yeah.

38:19.083 --> 38:23.571
I was just wondering,
what are you doing
in a place like this?

38:24.038 --> 38:28.043
Looking for Mr. Right,
and I think I might
have just found him.

38:30.045 --> 38:32.547
Why?

38:33.047 --> 38:37.552
Well, any man
with such a strong name
and strong body...

38:37.552 --> 38:41.523
Probably has
exactly what I need.

38:43.475 --> 38:45.477
What's that?

38:47.479 --> 38:50.984
Twelve inches.

38:50.984 --> 38:53.453
Twelve inches.

38:56.955 --> 38:59.459
Uh, well ...

39:00.960 --> 39:02.962
I...

39:02.962 --> 39:05.965
Hmm?
I guess I'd do.

39:05.965 --> 39:08.969
Well, hello, Mr. Right.

39:08.969 --> 39:11.972
Say, Jack, honey, I've got a
place just around the corner.

39:13.974 --> 39:17.478
Let's say we get out of here.

39:17.478 --> 39:20.981
- Get out.
- Get out.

39:21.982 --> 39:24.485
Oh, oh, I don't know.

39:24.485 --> 39:26.987
I-I'm here with my friend,
and, you know, we got...

39:26.987 --> 39:28.990
business.

39:28.990 --> 39:33.495
No problem.
I got plenty of time.
Help yourself.

39:33.495 --> 39:36.998
I'll just sit here
and wait for Sam.

39:50.513 --> 39:54.517
## Never met a girl
like you before ##

39:54.517 --> 39:59.022
## You're so cute ####

40:06.029 --> 40:09.534
Oh, shoot me, hurt me.

40:09.534 --> 40:11.535
Ooh, yes!

40:15.539 --> 40:18.041
Oh! You ...

40:18.041 --> 40:20.545
You are so sexy.

40:21.546 --> 40:23.548
Jack, I can't wait.

40:23.548 --> 40:25.550
Hmm, baby.
Give me ...

40:25.550 --> 40:28.052
Give me... Give me
all the 12 inches.

40:28.052 --> 40:30.055
All the 12...
Now!

40:30.055 --> 40:32.558
Oh, the 12. Um...
Now! Now!

40:32.558 --> 40:34.560
Now!
Oh, the 12, the 12.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.929
Yeah, that's good.
Ooh, that's good.
We gotta talk about this 12.

40:37.929 --> 40:39.932
Huh?
Twelve.

40:39.932 --> 40:45.437
I... Yeah,
about those 12 inches?

40:46.939 --> 40:48.441
Well, uh, I lied.

40:48.942 --> 40:52.445
I-I really don't have
12 inches.

40:52.445 --> 40:54.447
No?

40:54.447 --> 40:56.449
I hope I didn't
disappoint you.

40:59.954 --> 41:01.955
Well, I have a confession
to make too.

41:01.955 --> 41:03.957
Really?

41:05.959 --> 41:07.961
My eyes...

41:07.961 --> 41:09.964
Aren't really green.

41:12.466 --> 41:15.469
You know what else?

41:15.469 --> 41:17.972
Another secret. What?

41:22.477 --> 41:25.480
But this is nice
in the summer!

41:25.480 --> 41:29.735
Oh, wait.
I am glad to get these off.

41:29.735 --> 41:33.238
No, not that. Not the tits.
Please don't be the ...

41:33.238 --> 41:36.241
They're not even
the right color!

41:36.241 --> 41:40.747
- whoo!
- this voluptuous ass of mine?

41:44.250 --> 41:47.754
Oh, wait.

41:48.255 --> 41:50.757
Guys always get a kick
out of this one. Wait.

41:54.677 --> 41:58.181
Oh, god, I feel so much better.
I know you do too.

41:58.181 --> 42:01.685
Look, ooh... Whoo!
Hey, you see?

42:01.685 --> 42:04.688
It... You-you...
No, wait.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.691
I got to... I have got to...

42:07.691 --> 42:10.195
Oh, please,
Jack, honey, come on.

42:10.195 --> 42:14.833
Don't make me...
Don't make me hop after you.
Come on, baby.

42:19.337 --> 42:21.840
That was quick. What happened?

42:23.341 --> 42:25.343
It was unbelievable.

42:25.343 --> 42:27.345
- Slade!
- Hey, Sam!

42:27.846 --> 42:29.849
How are you, man?
You're lookin' good.

42:29.849 --> 42:31.851
Hey.
Good to see you.

42:31.851 --> 42:34.854
What's so damn important
you gotta wake me
out of my bed?

42:34.854 --> 42:37.356
We've got to score,
and we got to score tonight.

42:37.857 --> 42:39.860
- Follow me.
- You the man.

42:39.860 --> 42:41.861
Let's go.

42:52.572 --> 42:55.575
Sam, this youngblood
is Jack Spade.

42:55.575 --> 42:57.577
Jack, Sam.

42:57.577 --> 43:01.082
- You a soldier, boy?
- Yes, sir.

43:01.082 --> 43:04.085
What was your specialty,
son?

43:04.085 --> 43:06.470
I was a...

43:09.474 --> 43:12.477
I was the intermilitary
administrator.

43:12.477 --> 43:14.979
Well, I'll be damned.

43:14.979 --> 43:16.964
A secretary.

43:18.934 --> 43:21.937
Well, good to meet you, son.

43:22.321 --> 43:24.823
I was intermilitary
administrator myself.

43:27.826 --> 43:31.330
Sam. Sam, hold it, man.
You told me you served in 'nam.

43:31.330 --> 43:33.332
I did. Saigon.

43:33.332 --> 43:35.834
How'd you lose your eye?
Fuckin' around in the office.

43:35.834 --> 43:39.839
We were shootin' paper clips,
and one of the damn fools
hit me in the eye.

43:39.839 --> 43:41.841
Same thing
almost happened to me.

43:41.841 --> 43:44.844
How'd you win those fuckin'
medals on your coat?

43:44.844 --> 43:47.347
Well, this one is for typin'.

43:47.847 --> 43:51.469
And this one
is for dart champion.
This one is for surfin'.

43:51.469 --> 43:53.471
I got that one!
Never mind, never mind!

43:53.471 --> 43:56.473
Shut up.
Show me what you got.

44:03.731 --> 44:06.734
Well, they need to be cleaned
and oiled, but they work.

44:07.234 --> 44:08.737
Well, I could do that.

44:09.237 --> 44:11.740
Hey, all we need now
is an army.

44:15.243 --> 44:18.246
You take care of the weapons,
and I'll get us an army.

44:37.767 --> 44:40.771
Jack, I'm glad you're okay.
I was really worried about you.

44:40.771 --> 44:43.774
I cleaned the room up for you.

44:43.774 --> 44:45.776
Do you like it?

44:47.276 --> 44:49.780
Yeah, it's nice.

44:51.782 --> 44:53.784
May I sit down?

44:55.285 --> 44:57.287
Yeah.

45:07.799 --> 45:09.802
Jack,

45:10.803 --> 45:14.305
why didn't you write to me
all those years?

45:17.308 --> 45:19.812
I didn't have nothin'
to tell you.

45:21.313 --> 45:23.816
Well, you could have just
told me you were alive.

45:23.816 --> 45:26.819
Cheryl, I went away
to prove something to you.

45:26.819 --> 45:29.823
No, not to you.
Prove something to myself.

45:29.823 --> 45:33.827
That I can be a man for you,
that I can protect you.

45:33.827 --> 45:38.330
I mean, our whole lives,
every time we got into trouble,
my mother came.

45:38.330 --> 45:42.335
I never had a chance to prove
to you I could be a man.

45:42.335 --> 45:44.838
I figured I'd go in the army,
get into combat,

45:44.838 --> 45:47.340
have some great war stories
to tell you.

45:47.841 --> 45:50.845
I mean, I wait ten years
for a war... Nothing.

45:50.845 --> 45:54.348
I wind up being a secretary.

45:54.348 --> 45:58.352
Jack, you didn't
have to prove anything.

45:58.352 --> 46:00.856
Not to me.

46:00.856 --> 46:03.357
You've always been
the man for me, Jack.

46:03.858 --> 46:05.860
Yeah, and what about Junebug?

46:05.860 --> 46:09.364
I went out with Junebug
to remind me of you.

46:11.366 --> 46:13.368
You know, Jack...

46:21.377 --> 46:25.381
Remember when we used to go
down to the Soul Train Disco?

46:25.381 --> 46:27.883
And you would
get all dressed up,

46:27.883 --> 46:31.888
And I would put my hair
in those afro puffs?

46:33.389 --> 46:37.894
## Rhythmatic, acrobatic
she's a dynamite attraction ##

46:39.897 --> 46:41.899
## Yeah ##

46:41.899 --> 46:46.286
## She knows what she's doing
she's super-bad now ##

46:46.286 --> 46:50.291
## She's dancing
it really blows your mind ##

46:56.296 --> 46:58.800
Down! Ha-yii!

47:08.176 --> 47:10.680
## Dancin', dancin', dancin' ##

47:10.680 --> 47:13.683
Boy, we were a real knockout.

47:13.683 --> 47:16.685
Yeah. We were somethin'.

47:20.189 --> 47:23.693
## If ever a love there was ##

47:23.693 --> 47:27.196
## If ever two stars
were crossed ##

47:27.697 --> 47:30.200
## If ever a dream was born ##

47:30.200 --> 47:32.202
## Yeah ##

47:32.202 --> 47:34.204
## Then it was yours and mine ##

47:34.705 --> 47:38.709
## If ever a touch was right ##

47:38.709 --> 47:42.713
## or a future looked bright ##

47:43.213 --> 47:47.768
## If ever a love there was ##

48:03.786 --> 48:07.789
- May I help you, sir?
- How much for an order of ribs?

48:07.789 --> 48:10.793
- Uh, 2.50.
- 2.50?

48:11.293 --> 48:13.295
How many ribs
do I get with that?

48:13.796 --> 48:16.298
- Uh, about five.
- Five?

48:17.800 --> 48:20.804
So I guess that's about
50 cents a rib, huh?

48:20.804 --> 48:22.806
Yeah, about.

48:22.806 --> 48:24.808
Let me get one.

48:24.808 --> 48:27.811
Right on.
One order.
One order of ribs.

48:27.811 --> 48:30.815
No, no. No, no.
One rib.

48:30.815 --> 48:32.816
One rib?

48:33.316 --> 48:35.819
I sure am hungry.

48:37.821 --> 48:41.325
Um, make that one rib to go.

48:41.692 --> 48:44.695
- One rib?
- One rib.

48:45.696 --> 48:48.199
- What else?
- You got any soda?

48:48.199 --> 48:50.702
One dollar.

48:51.203 --> 48:54.206
Ah, come on now.
Look out for a brother, man.

48:54.206 --> 48:57.708
Come on. Check this out.
Why don't you let me get
a sip for 15 cents?

48:58.209 --> 49:01.713
My cups cost more than 15 cents.

49:02.214 --> 49:05.217
All right, fuck the cup.
Pour it in my hand
for a dime.

49:06.718 --> 49:08.720
Look, you greasy-headed,
jeri-curl wearin'...

49:08.720 --> 49:12.225
Pay me and get the hell
out of my store.

49:20.734 --> 49:23.236
You got change for a hundred?

49:23.236 --> 49:27.740
Look, we're gonna need
an orthopedic surgeon
to remove my foot from your ass.

49:27.740 --> 49:30.244
Hammer, Hammer.
No, brother, don't do it.

49:30.244 --> 49:32.746
You know the customer
is always king.
Hammer!

49:33.247 --> 49:35.249
Slade!
You son of a bitch.

49:35.249 --> 49:38.252
Slam, how you doin'?
Hey, man, I thought you
were dead or something.

49:38.752 --> 49:40.755
No, no.
Or worse...
Married and shit.

49:41.256 --> 49:43.758
Don't put that on me.
How you doing, brother?

49:43.758 --> 49:47.261
How you guys doing?
You all right?
Really good to see you.

49:47.261 --> 49:49.764
Listen, how would you guys
like to upgrade your image?

49:50.265 --> 49:52.267
What you talkin' about,
Slade?

49:52.267 --> 49:54.269
I'm talkin' about
doin' it one more time.

49:54.269 --> 49:57.772
I'm talkin' about
takin' it to the man.

49:57.772 --> 50:00.659
- Mr. Big.
- You got it, Slam.

50:00.659 --> 50:03.662
Man, you must be crazy.
Check this out.

50:03.662 --> 50:06.665
- We are businessmen now.
- Give me a break.

50:06.665 --> 50:11.670
You two big motherfuckers
in here making red beans
and grits is business?

50:11.670 --> 50:15.174
Damn, Slade.

50:15.174 --> 50:18.677
You sure know how
to piss on a man's parade.

50:18.677 --> 50:22.182
But, you know, it sure would be
good to be back on top again.

50:23.683 --> 50:27.170
- What do you say, Slammer?
- What the fuck.

50:27.170 --> 50:29.690
I ain't killed nobody
in a long time.

50:29.690 --> 50:33.194
The old warehouse,
6:00 P.M.

50:34.695 --> 50:37.197
Be there or be square.

50:40.685 --> 50:42.904
Five minutes, Flyguy.

50:45.406 --> 50:48.910
What do you say, buddy?
How you holdin' up?

50:49.161 --> 50:50.662
I'm hangin'.

50:52.164 --> 50:54.416
A few more hours,
I'll be a free man.

50:54.416 --> 50:55.918
So what are your plans?

50:59.422 --> 51:02.424
Hey, man,
let's cut the bullshit.

51:02.424 --> 51:04.927
We known each other
too long for that.

51:05.310 --> 51:07.813
- What are you here for?
- Mr. Big.

51:09.315 --> 51:14.070
- Big? What about him?
- We're gonna take him down.

51:18.574 --> 51:21.578
I've been away too long.
Count me out.

51:21.578 --> 51:24.531
The reason you been away so long
is 'cause Mr. Big shot your ass
through the grease...

51:24.531 --> 51:27.033
and put your black butt
in this joint.

51:27.283 --> 51:31.121
At one time, you were
the biggest and baddest
player out there, man.

51:31.121 --> 51:33.123
Remember?

51:35.592 --> 51:38.545
Yeah, I remember.

51:38.545 --> 51:40.548
I was Pimp of the Year.

51:40.548 --> 51:43.051
Now, this has really been
an exciting competition.

51:43.551 --> 51:45.553
Now we'd like to announce
our two finalists.

51:45.553 --> 51:49.057
But first, how about a big hand
for all our contestants?

51:49.057 --> 51:51.060
All right.
There we go.

51:57.565 --> 52:00.069
The final category is talent.

52:00.069 --> 52:04.824
Representing the big apple,
Flyguy!

52:06.826 --> 52:08.828
I'm gonna try to do
a little poetry for y'all.

52:11.331 --> 52:15.335
It's an original piece
written by me, Flyguy.

52:15.719 --> 52:19.221
I want to dedicate this piece
to all you players...

52:19.723 --> 52:22.726
And all you ladies out there.

52:22.726 --> 52:24.728
Come on, baby!

52:24.728 --> 52:27.731
Name of this piece is called...

52:28.231 --> 52:30.234
"My bitch better have my money."

52:33.354 --> 52:36.357
My bitch better have my money...

52:36.357 --> 52:38.860
through rain, sleet or snow.

52:38.860 --> 52:42.363
- Brother's a Shakespeare!
- My ho better have my money.

52:42.363 --> 52:43.865
That boy's a genius!
Tell it!

52:43.865 --> 52:46.868
Not half, not some,

52:46.868 --> 52:49.872
But all my cash.

52:49.872 --> 52:51.874
Because if she don't,

52:51.874 --> 52:53.876
I'm gonna put my foot
dead in her ass.

52:55.878 --> 52:59.382
The pimp of the year is Flyguy!

52:59.883 --> 53:02.886
Flyguy! Flyguy!

53:02.886 --> 53:08.390
## Picked by the brother's
brother here ##

53:08.640 --> 53:13.146
## Picked by a jury
of his peers ##

53:13.146 --> 53:18.151
## He's the pimp of the year ##
Flyguy! Flyguy!

53:18.284 --> 53:20.788
Flyguy! Flyguy!
## He's the pimp ##

53:20.788 --> 53:23.791
## Of the year ##

53:24.291 --> 53:27.745
## He's the pimp of the year ##
Flyguy.

53:27.878 --> 53:31.633
I want some information
about the operation.

53:31.633 --> 53:34.635
Where it is, how big it is,
how many places.

53:35.136 --> 53:38.639
Ten years of conversations
in this place, with these cats
coming in and out,

53:38.756 --> 53:40.225
You got the 4-1-1.

53:40.725 --> 53:43.728
Okay, I can do that for you.

53:45.480 --> 53:48.483
You gotta promise me
y'all won't hassle me.

53:48.984 --> 53:51.988
I'm goin' back out
on the street...

53:51.988 --> 53:54.991
And I'm takin' back
what's mine,

53:54.991 --> 53:58.493
And everything's gonna be
just like it used to be.

53:59.495 --> 54:02.498
I got no beef with you,
Flyguy,

54:02.498 --> 54:04.500
But I want Mr. Big.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.469
Solid.

54:07.753 --> 54:10.257
## It's so real
you can feel it ##

54:10.257 --> 54:12.759
## And it's real ##

54:12.876 --> 54:14.878
## So real ##
## So real, so real

54:15.379 --> 54:17.381
Oh, man.

54:17.881 --> 54:21.386
It's so good
to be off my feet, man.
They been killin' me.

54:21.886 --> 54:23.387
## I can dig it
He can dig it
We can dig it ##

54:23.387 --> 54:25.389
## She can dig it
They can dig it
You can dig it ##

54:25.389 --> 54:27.391
## Oh, we're diggin'... ##

54:27.391 --> 54:29.393
Hey, man, do you have to sing?

54:29.393 --> 54:32.897
I told you
my feet been killin' me,
you don't even care.

54:32.897 --> 54:36.901
Say, man, if you can't dig
my melodious voice,

54:36.901 --> 54:40.406
then just step on outside
and walk on them precious,
tender feet of yours.

54:40.406 --> 54:42.408
Walk?

54:42.408 --> 54:45.911
Man, I ain't walkin' nowhere,
as bad as these bunions feel.

54:45.911 --> 54:48.413
You must be crazy.

54:49.548 --> 54:51.550
Let's go.
Oh, here we go.

54:51.550 --> 54:54.553
Shit. Man, I hate
comin' into the city.

54:54.553 --> 54:56.922
I'll get it
nice and clean for you, man.

54:57.306 --> 54:59.676
Let me get your window!
Get off the goddamn car.

55:01.561 --> 55:04.064
Hey!
Oh, man!

55:04.431 --> 55:06.933
Yeah, man, okay.
I got it.

55:06.933 --> 55:08.935
It's in my hands.

55:50.113 --> 55:52.115
## Down from the bar ##

55:52.115 --> 55:55.118
## There's a platform stage ##

55:55.118 --> 55:57.237
## People primpin', pimpin' ##

55:57.737 --> 56:00.241
## Sharp as razor blades ##

56:00.241 --> 56:02.242
Yo, check out homeboy.

56:05.745 --> 56:07.747
Say, dominic,
brother's out there, huh?

56:14.255 --> 56:17.258
Look at the fish in those shoes!

56:17.258 --> 56:19.644
Girl, he must be a rock star.

56:22.147 --> 56:24.649
This brother's walkin'
on an aquarium.

56:25.150 --> 56:27.651
Say, brother, do you get
nosebleeds way up there?

56:28.152 --> 56:31.156
Maybe it's his dinner.

56:31.156 --> 56:35.160
Hey, homey,
are you expectin' a flood?

56:41.417 --> 56:44.420
Say, brother, you been shoppin'
at the Goodwill?

56:44.420 --> 56:48.424
Hey, brother, that's
an endangered species.

56:48.674 --> 56:51.295
He looks like a clown!

56:53.796 --> 56:56.299
Where's the Mardi Gras?

57:01.805 --> 57:03.807
Hey, Jack.
All right.

57:03.807 --> 57:06.310
You got the stuff?
Yeah.

57:06.310 --> 57:08.312
All cleaned and oiled.

57:09.814 --> 57:12.817
Oh, yeah.
Beautiful. Beautiful.

57:12.817 --> 57:15.820
- Let's get it on.
- Who are these guys?

57:15.820 --> 57:19.824
That's my theme music.
Every good hero
should have some.

57:32.838 --> 57:34.840
Hammer.
Good to see you.

57:34.840 --> 57:37.843
Slade.
Slammer, glad you could make it.

57:40.347 --> 57:41.848
Who are we waitin' on?
Kung Fu Joe.

57:42.348 --> 57:43.849
He'll be here in a minute.

57:44.350 --> 57:45.851
Who is he?

57:46.352 --> 57:49.355
This is Jack Spade, that new
blood I was talkin' about.

57:49.355 --> 57:51.358
What?

57:51.358 --> 57:54.361
Yo, new blood, you ever kill
a man before?

57:54.361 --> 57:56.363
No.

57:56.746 --> 58:00.251
You ever splatter a man's brains
up against the wall?

58:00.251 --> 58:02.253
No.

58:02.253 --> 58:06.507
You ever took a big, shiny blade
and just ripped a man
from his ass to his appetite?

58:06.507 --> 58:10.511
- No.
- Then cut his balls off and
made him squeal like a pig?

58:11.011 --> 58:13.514
Hammer. Hammer!
And then stuffed 'em
in his mouth and...

58:14.014 --> 58:15.516
Okay.

58:16.016 --> 58:18.018
It's all right.

58:18.519 --> 58:22.524
- Well, have you?
- No, but I been trained
to go out...

58:22.524 --> 58:25.527
Hey, man, no way.
This cat get
all our asses killed.

58:26.027 --> 58:28.530
Man, look at him.
He look funny.
Look how he's lookin' at us.

58:29.030 --> 58:30.533
I can handle myself.

58:30.533 --> 58:32.534
Oh, yeah?

58:36.037 --> 58:39.408
What makes you think
you can be a black hero?

58:42.412 --> 58:44.414
I'm an ex-football player.

58:54.425 --> 58:56.927
Hey! Kung Fu Joe.
Oh, my brothers.

58:57.427 --> 58:58.928
I see you started without me.

58:59.429 --> 59:00.931
Hiii! How are you?

59:01.432 --> 59:03.934
What's happenin'?

59:03.934 --> 59:06.937
- Kung Fu!
- My man! Hyah!

59:06.937 --> 59:09.440
Hey, man, look, now that we're
here, what's happenin'?

59:09.440 --> 59:11.443
Here's the deal.

59:11.443 --> 59:15.447
The first thing we do
is disrupt Big's businesses.
Break 'em all up.

59:15.447 --> 59:18.950
The next thing is, we harass
all of his people.

59:18.950 --> 59:22.454
Now look, once the deal goes
down, ain't no backin' off.

59:22.454 --> 59:26.458
They killed my teacher!
Why, why, why, why, why?

59:26.458 --> 59:29.962
Teacher! Teacher!

59:30.963 --> 59:32.965
Wow!

59:32.965 --> 59:36.469
Master Lee was
your kung fu teacher?

59:36.469 --> 59:39.472
No. Acting.

59:40.474 --> 59:42.976
Let's get that sucka.

59:46.980 --> 59:49.482
All right, guys, this is it.

59:49.482 --> 59:51.485
Mr. Big's hottest night spot.

59:51.485 --> 59:55.989
Every criminal and major player
in town is inside.

59:58.492 --> 01:00:00.995
Gentlemen, you gotta have big
hats to come in here.

01:00:01.496 --> 01:00:02.997
That's the rules of the house.

01:00:03.498 --> 01:00:06.133
I think you're gonna make an
exception this time, brother.

01:00:06.634 --> 01:00:08.636
All right, okay.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:16.143
Hey, are y'all crazy?

01:00:16.143 --> 01:00:18.646
Don't you know
this is Mr. Big's place?

01:00:18.646 --> 01:00:22.150
Looks like you just lost
your liquor license.

01:00:27.022 --> 01:00:29.525
Everybody get your hands up,

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:32.529
Take that funky gold
off your necks,

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:36.032
and put it on the table
right now!

01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:40.169
Let's go. Hurry up.

01:00:46.292 --> 01:00:48.795
Okay, you guys, come out from
under those hats.

01:00:48.795 --> 01:00:51.298
Come on!

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:53.183
Wayne Evans!

01:00:53.551 --> 01:00:55.553
The Evans Family!

01:00:55.553 --> 01:00:57.438
- Fifth grade!

01:00:57.938 --> 01:01:01.810
I want my nickel!
Give me my nickel back!

01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:05.312
This is for your brother!
Let's just say I ain't forgot!
No! Come on, man!

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:07.698
I ain't forgot!
I ain't forgot fifth grade!

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:10.569
Hey, man, from the waist down,
you're mine!

01:01:10.569 --> 01:01:14.706
Yeah? Get on a ladder
and see how tough you are!
Let me put you in a chair!

01:01:14.956 --> 01:01:17.459
I was gonna buy a scooter pie
with that money, man!

01:01:17.959 --> 01:01:19.961
Jack, shut up! Shut up!

01:01:20.463 --> 01:01:22.465
Now, all y'all listen up here!

01:01:22.965 --> 01:01:25.968
Don't try to follow us,
'cause all your cars
are on blocks.

01:01:25.968 --> 01:01:30.473
But don't worry. The police'll
be here to take y'all to jail.

01:01:30.473 --> 01:01:33.976
And you tell
the rest of your family,
when I see 'em, they mine!

01:01:33.976 --> 01:01:36.479
They mine!

01:01:36.479 --> 01:01:38.481
And Lois Mitchell too!

01:01:45.238 --> 01:01:47.240
## Who's makin' love ##

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.743
## to your old lady ##

01:01:49.743 --> 01:01:52.246
## are you out makin' love ##

01:01:52.246 --> 01:01:55.749
Come out of there!
Move it! Move it!

01:01:55.749 --> 01:01:57.751
Let's go! Come on!

01:01:57.751 --> 01:02:01.255
Come on, let's go!
Move, move, move, move!

01:02:01.255 --> 01:02:03.257
Let's go!

01:02:04.258 --> 01:02:06.260
Let's go! Come on!

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.262
Get out of here!

01:02:11.767 --> 01:02:13.769
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

01:02:13.769 --> 01:02:17.272
- Can I get a little coffee?
- Sure, just a moment.
We got your greasy dairy.

01:02:17.272 --> 01:02:20.024
Miss, I'd like a little
coffee here, please!

01:02:21.527 --> 01:02:24.530
I just want a little coffee.

01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:26.532
These cramps are killing me.

01:02:26.532 --> 01:02:28.784
I'd like a little coffee,
please!

01:02:29.151 --> 01:02:32.656
What are you, deaf?
Can I get a little coffee?
Please?

01:02:33.156 --> 01:02:34.658
Cheryl, you okay?

01:02:35.158 --> 01:02:38.161
I think I'd better go home.

01:02:38.662 --> 01:02:41.165
- It's my time.
- Girl, me too.

01:02:42.166 --> 01:02:45.669
I'm gonna go and lay down.
Okay?

01:02:45.669 --> 01:02:48.171
I know exactly how you feel.

01:02:48.171 --> 01:02:50.173
Be strong.

01:03:44.615 --> 01:03:48.118
All right, sweet thing, it's
time to come home to daddy.

01:03:49.119 --> 01:03:52.624
Please, please,
just leave me alone.

01:03:52.624 --> 01:03:55.627
Bitch, I said
you comin' with me.

01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:08.640
Oh, shit!
You must got the devil in you!

01:04:09.641 --> 01:04:11.644
No!

01:04:11.644 --> 01:04:13.646
Cramps!

01:04:22.155 --> 01:04:23.656
I asked you nicely.

01:04:24.156 --> 01:04:28.160
Now I'm going to
rip your balls off!

01:04:32.165 --> 01:04:34.167
You okay, Lenny?

01:04:34.668 --> 01:04:37.170
Yeah. It's a good thing
you came, boy.

01:04:37.671 --> 01:04:40.173
Yeah, 'cause I heard you
screamin' all the way down there.

01:04:40.675 --> 01:04:42.677
I wasn't screamin'!
All right?

01:04:43.177 --> 01:04:45.179
- Yes, you was...
- I said I wasn't screamin'.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.682
- I was whistlin'.
- You was what?

01:04:47.682 --> 01:04:49.683
I was whistlin' for you!

01:04:49.683 --> 01:04:53.688
You was whistlin',
"Willie, help get this bitch
off of me"?

01:04:53.688 --> 01:04:55.690
Yeah!

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:59.193
Now get her butt in the car
before she wake up again.

01:05:20.165 --> 01:05:22.802
Nobody, but I mean nobody
does this to me and lives.

01:05:22.802 --> 01:05:24.804
Give me lieutenant Baker
on the phone.

01:05:26.306 --> 01:05:27.807
Leonard.

01:05:27.807 --> 01:05:30.310
Take the girl to the hideout.
Yes, Mr. Big.

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:33.814
- Lt. Baker is on the line.
- Hello, Baker. This is Big.

01:05:34.315 --> 01:05:35.816
What the hell happened
last night?

01:05:36.317 --> 01:05:38.818
That soldier boy and his goons
hit every one of my operations.

01:05:39.319 --> 01:05:41.822
He stole everyone's drugs,
money and gold chains.

01:05:42.323 --> 01:05:45.826
I want you to help me
find those bastards that hit me
and get rid of 'em!

01:05:45.826 --> 01:05:48.329
How am I gonna do that?
I'm a cop.

01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:52.834
I don't give a damn how. Set 'em
up or something. Just do it.

01:06:02.712 --> 01:06:06.214
You wanna get out of the car?

01:06:06.214 --> 01:06:07.716
What's the problem, officer?

01:06:08.216 --> 01:06:10.218
Just step out of the car.

01:06:12.722 --> 01:06:14.724
The door is ajar.

01:06:15.224 --> 01:06:17.727
- Get your hands on the hood.
- Please close the door.

01:06:17.727 --> 01:06:21.231
Your door is ajar.

01:06:21.481 --> 01:06:22.983
Look what we got here.

01:06:23.483 --> 01:06:25.986
I said, close the door,
shithead!

01:06:26.486 --> 01:06:28.487
So you want to try
and set me up, huh?

01:06:28.988 --> 01:06:31.491
## Everybody
was kung fu fighting ##

01:06:32.993 --> 01:06:36.997
## Those cats
were fast as lightning ##

01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:41.252
## In fact, it was
a little bit frightening ##

01:06:43.004 --> 01:06:44.505
## But they did it
with expert timing ####

01:06:45.006 --> 01:06:48.509
Your arm! Spare ribs!
Have a nice nap!

01:06:51.013 --> 01:06:55.016
Ohh, I'm gonna
kick some ass now.

01:07:06.528 --> 01:07:11.534
So, just you 57 punks
against Kung Fu Joe?

01:07:11.918 --> 01:07:16.423
Master of karate,
kung fu, jujitsu...

01:07:16.923 --> 01:07:19.925
And all other shit
you ain't never heard of!

01:07:25.432 --> 01:07:28.435
Hey!
You boys goin' somewhere?

01:07:37.945 --> 01:07:40.949
How come their guns are so much
bigger than ours?

01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:43.567
It's a phallic thing.
I don't know.

01:07:45.569 --> 01:07:48.072
Oh, no!
Hey, what are you doing?

01:07:48.572 --> 01:07:50.074
Get off of me!

01:07:50.074 --> 01:07:53.328
Ohh! Oh, no!

01:07:58.333 --> 01:08:01.337
Hey, sorry, man.
I don't know that karate.

01:08:01.337 --> 01:08:03.339
Me neither.

01:08:03.339 --> 01:08:05.842
- You wanna fake it?
- I don't care.

01:08:12.098 --> 01:08:14.100
No!
I didn't shoot you!

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.987
I could've shot you.
I made sure that I missed.
I did.

01:08:17.987 --> 01:08:19.988
Wait a minute!
Wait one minute!

01:08:19.988 --> 01:08:22.993
You got a .45 revolver
that holds six bullets.

01:08:22.993 --> 01:08:26.497
I counted at least 20 shots,
and you never reloaded.

01:08:26.497 --> 01:08:28.999
- That's right.
- Come on!

01:08:28.999 --> 01:08:31.502
Hold it!
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:08:31.502 --> 01:08:34.004
Hold it.
That's Big's nephew.

01:08:34.254 --> 01:08:36.256
He just might come in handy.

01:08:36.622 --> 01:08:38.125
You okay, man?

01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:41.129
All that damn runnin', man,
got my feet hurtin'.

01:08:41.629 --> 01:08:44.131
But other than that,
I'm all right.

01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:46.634
We'd better go find Slade.

01:08:53.526 --> 01:08:56.028
Five, four, three, two.

01:09:00.031 --> 01:09:02.033
- Hello?
- Slade?

01:09:02.033 --> 01:09:05.037
- Yeah.
- It's Joe.

01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:08.541
I've come to warn you...

01:09:08.541 --> 01:09:11.044
They tried to ambush me.

01:09:12.045 --> 01:09:15.048
And now they're going to
try and ambush you...

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:18.551
and the brothers.

01:09:19.051 --> 01:09:21.555
I fooled you.
I'm not home right now.

01:09:22.055 --> 01:09:25.058
- Leave your name and number.
I'll call you back.
- Say what?

01:09:25.559 --> 01:09:28.562
- Thanks for calling. Bye.
- He ain't home?

01:09:29.563 --> 01:09:31.566
Aw, homey ain't home.

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:36.904
- I've gotta find Cheryl.
- And just how you plan
on doin' that?

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:39.907
We don't even know
where they're holdin' her.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:44.912
Yeah? Well, I bet
my man over here does.

01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:50.919
Well, I'm glad you finally
figured something out,
G.I. Joe.

01:09:50.919 --> 01:09:53.921
But I'm not tellin' you shit.
So how you like me now?

01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:56.175
Yes, you will.

01:09:57.176 --> 01:09:59.678
Well, my pretty,

01:10:00.179 --> 01:10:03.683
Soon it'll be you and me.

01:10:03.683 --> 01:10:07.687
By midnight, your lover and his
friends will be dead...

01:10:08.188 --> 01:10:11.692
and you will be Mr. Big's
big moneymaker.

01:10:11.692 --> 01:10:14.694
Yes, you will.

01:10:15.195 --> 01:10:16.696
## War##

01:10:16.696 --> 01:10:17.697
## Yeah ##

01:10:18.198 --> 01:10:19.699
## What is it good for ##

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.702
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

01:10:21.702 --> 01:10:24.205
## Uh-huh, uh-huh ##
## War ##

01:10:24.205 --> 01:10:26.707
## Huhh ##
## Yeah ##

01:10:26.707 --> 01:10:28.709
## What is it good for ##

01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:30.211
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

01:10:30.711 --> 01:10:32.214
## Say it again, y'all ##

01:10:32.214 --> 01:10:34.216
## War, look out ##

01:10:34.216 --> 01:10:37.085
## What is it good for ##

01:10:37.085 --> 01:10:38.086
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

01:10:38.586 --> 01:10:41.590
## Listen to me
Ohhh, war ##

01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:43.592
## I despise ##

01:10:44.092 --> 01:10:46.595
## 'Cause it means
destruction ##

01:10:47.095 --> 01:10:49.848
## of innocent lives ##

01:10:49.848 --> 01:10:53.102
## War means tears to
thousands of mothers' eyes ##

01:10:53.603 --> 01:10:55.605
## When their sons
go off to fight ##

01:10:55.605 --> 01:10:58.107
## and lose their lives ##

01:10:58.107 --> 01:11:01.995
## I said, war, huhh
good god, y'all ##

01:11:01.995 --> 01:11:03.996
## What is it good for ##

01:11:03.996 --> 01:11:05.748
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

01:11:06.249 --> 01:11:09.252
## Say it again ##
## War ##

01:11:09.252 --> 01:11:10.753
## Whoa-ohh-ohh, lord ##

01:11:10.753 --> 01:11:13.257
## What is it good for ##

01:11:13.257 --> 01:11:14.258
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

01:11:14.758 --> 01:11:16.260
## Listen to me ##

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.761
## War ##
## It ain't nothin'
but a heartbreak ##

01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:20.764
Hey, man, are you sure
you got enough?

01:11:20.764 --> 01:11:23.268
You can never have enough,
brother.

01:11:23.268 --> 01:11:25.770
## Ohh, war ##

01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:29.523
## Is an enemy
to all mankind ##

01:11:29.523 --> 01:11:33.144
## The thought of war
blows my mind ##

01:11:39.784 --> 01:11:42.538
Oh, jesus!
My nuts!

01:11:57.553 --> 01:12:01.558
Hammer! Hammer!
Are you all right, man?

01:12:03.677 --> 01:12:05.679
Did we get
that son of a bitch?

01:12:06.179 --> 01:12:09.683
Hold on, brother. We got an
ambulance on the way.

01:12:11.686 --> 01:12:13.688
Let's get that sucka!

01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:18.692
You think I'm cute?

01:12:21.696 --> 01:12:23.698
I'm cute, right?

01:12:23.698 --> 01:12:26.200
Mm-hmm.
I'm cuter than Jack?

01:12:30.955 --> 01:12:32.958
There she is!

01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:35.961
There's only a few guys guarding
her, but I don't see Mr. Big.

01:12:35.961 --> 01:12:37.963
Let me see it.

01:12:41.467 --> 01:12:43.969
Yeah.

01:12:43.969 --> 01:12:46.972
Look, here's the plan.

01:12:46.972 --> 01:12:49.941
I'll take this rope and repel
down the wall over there,

01:12:49.941 --> 01:12:52.895
take one of these bombs,
crash through the window
causing a diversion.

01:12:53.396 --> 01:12:56.899
Once I'm inside, Jack, you go
through that window,

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.901
and Slammer,
go through that door.

01:12:59.402 --> 01:13:02.406
How come I can't go
through the window?
I never get to no more.

01:13:02.906 --> 01:13:04.408
Well, pardon fuckin' me, then.

01:13:04.908 --> 01:13:07.378
Okay, you crash through
the goddamn window,

01:13:07.378 --> 01:13:09.379
and Jack,
you go through the door.

01:13:09.379 --> 01:13:11.382
Got it.

01:13:11.382 --> 01:13:15.636
I'll start at the top,
you get at the bottom, and if
we're lucky we'll survive this.

01:13:15.636 --> 01:13:18.138
Lift!
Ohh!

01:13:18.639 --> 01:13:20.641
Give me a hand.

01:14:14.565 --> 01:14:16.067
You farted?

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.703
Slade! Slade, come in!

01:14:20.705 --> 01:14:23.325
You ready?

01:14:26.828 --> 01:14:28.329
Nobody move!

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:46.349
Are you all right?

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:50.352
Man, I'm all right.
It's been a long time.
I'm just a little rusty.

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:53.857
## Here we go, here we go ##

01:15:08.372 --> 01:15:10.374
Weasel... What?

01:15:10.875 --> 01:15:12.377
What happened to you, Weasel?

01:15:12.878 --> 01:15:16.380
Soldier boy!

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:19.383
Oh, damn!
The soldier boy is here, man!

01:15:26.892 --> 01:15:29.394
Jack! I'm hit!

01:15:32.899 --> 01:15:35.401
Shit.
You okay?

01:15:35.401 --> 01:15:37.403
I'm hit.

01:15:37.403 --> 01:15:39.404
Where you... Where you hit at?

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:41.406
In my foot.

01:15:41.406 --> 01:15:43.409
Oh, my god.

01:15:43.409 --> 01:15:46.412
They shot me in my bunion, man.

01:15:46.412 --> 01:15:48.915
Damn, man, I can't go on.

01:15:49.916 --> 01:15:52.419
W-well, what am I gon' do?

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.421
Get 'em for me, Jack.

01:15:54.922 --> 01:15:57.925
I c... But I can't!
I can't go alone!

01:15:57.925 --> 01:15:59.927
You're down,
and Slade's not here!

01:15:59.927 --> 01:16:01.930
I c...

01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:03.932
Slade!

01:16:03.932 --> 01:16:06.433
Ain't nobody
shootin' my baby.

01:16:06.433 --> 01:16:08.435
Ma! Ma, you promised!

01:16:08.435 --> 01:16:12.440
Shh! I know I promised.
What am I supposed to do,
stand by while they kill you?

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:15.193
- Let's get out of here.
Follow me.
- No, you follow me.

01:16:15.693 --> 01:16:18.196
- Follow me!
- I don't care who follows who.

01:16:18.696 --> 01:16:22.701
If y'all step on my bunion,
I'll kill both of you.

01:16:22.701 --> 01:16:26.705
- You gon' be okay, man?
- I'll be okay.

01:16:26.705 --> 01:16:29.207
I can do it, man.

01:16:29.207 --> 01:16:31.209
I won't let you down.

01:16:33.712 --> 01:16:37.216
You gotta put that foot
in some epsom salts,
get that swellin' outta there.

01:16:37.716 --> 01:16:39.718
- Come on, mama!
- Let's get outta here.

01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:46.226
Through that door!
Go, go, go!

01:16:47.227 --> 01:16:49.863
Open this door!

01:16:49.863 --> 01:16:51.732
Jack, let me outta here!
Jack!

01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:55.235
Jack! Jack!
Let me outta here!

01:16:55.735 --> 01:16:59.623
Open this door!
Slade? Anybody!

01:17:12.304 --> 01:17:14.306
## Hard-core military ##

01:17:57.801 --> 01:17:59.303
Jack!

01:18:00.804 --> 01:18:02.807
Jack!

01:18:15.203 --> 01:18:17.205
Jack!

01:18:22.211 --> 01:18:24.213
Aaah!
My eyes!

01:18:33.223 --> 01:18:35.725
My eyes! My eyes!

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:53.244
Get me outta here!
I missed you too, muffin.

01:18:53.494 --> 01:18:56.497
Oh, this?
This hurt real bad.

01:18:56.998 --> 01:18:59.000
But I'm okay, you know.

01:18:59.117 --> 01:19:02.620
All right, soldier boy.
Party's over, baby.
Where you want your bullet?

01:19:03.755 --> 01:19:05.256
Where you want it?

01:19:05.623 --> 01:19:09.127
## He's a Flyguy ##

01:19:09.127 --> 01:19:11.129
Chill it, brother.

01:19:12.631 --> 01:19:17.770
I wouldn't do that
if I was you... Chump.

01:19:21.774 --> 01:19:24.277
Man, I don't know who you are,
but I owe you one.

01:19:24.277 --> 01:19:27.279
Now, you...
Where's Big?

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:31.283
Forget about Big.
Grab the chick.
Let's split.

01:19:31.283 --> 01:19:33.286
Not so fast, boys!

01:19:33.286 --> 01:19:36.790
Nobody moves,
or the girl gets it first.

01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:38.792
Get over there!

01:19:39.793 --> 01:19:42.797
You?
You're Mr. Big?

01:19:44.298 --> 01:19:46.884
- But I thought you were...
- What?

01:19:47.384 --> 01:19:51.337
Above playing
an exploitation villain?
Well, you're wrong!

01:19:51.471 --> 01:19:54.975
Lots of famous people have
done exploitation movies.

01:19:55.476 --> 01:19:57.478
Uh, Shelley Winters
was in...

01:19:57.728 --> 01:19:59.730
Cleopatra Jones.

01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:02.434
Uh, Angie Dickinson.

01:20:02.434 --> 01:20:04.936
- Uh, Big Bad Mama!
- Big Bad Mama.

01:20:04.936 --> 01:20:07.322
Jamie Lee Curtis?

01:20:07.823 --> 01:20:09.324
Halloween!
Right, right, right!

01:20:09.825 --> 01:20:11.827
And now I'm Mr. Big.

01:20:12.328 --> 01:20:13.830
And I'm sorry, boys,

01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:16.832
But there ain't gonna be
a sequel to this one.

01:20:16.832 --> 01:20:18.333
Don't try it, Big.

01:20:25.842 --> 01:20:28.845
I got you, sucka.

01:20:39.356 --> 01:20:41.357
You did it, Jack.

01:20:42.359 --> 01:20:44.862
You did it.

01:20:44.862 --> 01:20:47.865
Yeah.
Yeah, I did it.

01:20:58.877 --> 01:21:00.879
Let's go home.

01:21:01.379 --> 01:21:03.382
Okay.

01:21:03.382 --> 01:21:05.884
- What about him?
- Ah, let him go.

01:21:05.884 --> 01:21:07.385
Hey, thanks, man.

01:21:07.886 --> 01:21:09.888
I promise, man,
I'm gon' go straight.

01:21:10.388 --> 01:21:13.893
- Yeah, well, you know
there's two ways out of here.
- Oh, man!

01:21:14.393 --> 01:21:19.148
All y'all just kiss
my natural black ass!

01:21:24.154 --> 01:21:27.107
Didn't he know
about the elevator?

01:21:27.107 --> 01:21:28.825
Okay, let's go!

01:21:31.827 --> 01:21:33.830
Let's move it!
Move it!

01:21:38.335 --> 01:21:40.337
Watch your head.

01:21:44.842 --> 01:21:49.347
Looks like I'd better
go check my flypaper,
see what's stickin'.

01:21:49.347 --> 01:21:51.349
You owe me one.

01:21:51.349 --> 01:21:53.352
And you got it.

01:21:53.352 --> 01:21:55.353
Get in that car!
Watch your head.

01:21:55.353 --> 01:21:57.855
Hey, Peterson,
clear this mess up.
You got it.

01:21:57.855 --> 01:22:00.358
What about Hammer and Slammer?

01:22:00.358 --> 01:22:03.362
Hammer'll be all right.
A few flesh wounds.

01:22:03.362 --> 01:22:06.865
It seems that bullets
have a difficult time
finding his vital parts.

01:22:06.865 --> 01:22:10.369
And Slammer, well,
it'll be a while before
he wears any tight shoes.

01:22:10.369 --> 01:22:15.491
Jack! Jack Spade!
I will never forgive you
for lockin' me in that closet.

01:22:15.491 --> 01:22:18.995
How could you do that
to your mama?
Huh? How could you?

01:22:19.495 --> 01:22:22.999
M-ma, now listen.
I can ex...
You can explain?

01:22:22.999 --> 01:22:28.504
Explain how I laid up in that
hospital for 36 hours in labor,
tryin' to give birth to you!

01:22:28.504 --> 01:22:30.006
I almost died.

01:22:30.506 --> 01:22:35.512
Explain how I sacrificed
my entire life for you,
tryin' to raise you right!

01:22:36.013 --> 01:22:38.015
Explain!
Bell. Bell.

01:22:38.515 --> 01:22:41.018
I told him to do it.

01:22:41.018 --> 01:22:43.021
How could you,
Slade?

01:22:43.021 --> 01:22:47.024
Because I love you,
and I wanted to make sure
we'd be together again.

01:22:47.024 --> 01:22:49.526
Oh, Slade.
Oh, baby.

01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:56.034
- Yo, Jack, what's up, man?
- Yo, B.D.P.

01:22:59.170 --> 01:23:02.675
Jack, who are these guys?

01:23:02.675 --> 01:23:05.177
That's my theme music.

01:23:05.177 --> 01:23:07.680
Every good hero
should have some.

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:09.681
See you around.

01:23:10.181 --> 01:23:12.685
## Again we start
let me say my part ##

01:23:12.685 --> 01:23:14.687
## About the only guy
who has some heart ##

01:23:15.187 --> 01:23:18.190
## It took some time
for the heart to come
but it's here ##

01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:19.692
## And everybody's in fear ##

01:23:19.692 --> 01:23:22.195
## Crashin' through
the door of that whore ##

01:23:22.195 --> 01:23:24.197
## Bringin' an end
to this gold chain war ##

01:23:24.197 --> 01:23:27.200
## What you saw
KRS-ONE is now seeing ##

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.702
## Another fly human being ##

01:23:28.702 --> 01:23:31.204
## Making no excuses
for the losers ##

01:23:31.204 --> 01:23:33.708
## Chain snatchers, pimps
drug abusers ##

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:36.209
## You don't like it
but you gotta keep pushing ##

01:23:36.209 --> 01:23:39.212
## Until somebody starts
mushing all these suckers ##

01:23:39.212 --> 01:23:40.714
## Claimin' to rule
they environment ##

01:23:40.714 --> 01:23:42.717
## No, man
I ain't buyin' it ##

01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:45.720
## You seem to think that
everybody can be taught ##

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.221
## That everyone else
can be bought ##

01:23:47.221 --> 01:23:50.224
## But you took it short
