WEBVTT

00:06.549 --> 00:08.676
[Unknown] Dumnonia has
a new heir.

00:08.759 --> 00:11.762
Persuade your uncle to come
to Mordred's Naming ceremony.

00:11.846 --> 00:14.265
He won't travel for days
to honor a puking baby.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.933
[Arthur] Bring him here.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.601
-[Bedwin] Is it true?
-[Arthur] I've learned that

00:17.685 --> 00:20.396
powerful men are more useful
alive than dead.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.356
King Gorfydd,
I'm glad you came.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.191
I'm sorry
you won't shake my hand.

00:24.275 --> 00:26.610
Well, you're a bastard.
You must be used to that.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.740
You will pledge
to the Edling King,

00:31.824 --> 00:34.285
or I will take
everything from you.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.287
You're with child
from Gundleus.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.746
I cannot bear his child.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.456
[Merlin] That's
for the Gods to decide.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.667
-[man] Nimue!
-[Owain] Cadwys has

00:41.750 --> 00:43.460
a dispute
with some local miners.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.837
We're going to help him
resolve it.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.257
We'll be in and out, Derfel.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.384
No fuss, no bloodshed.

00:52.678 --> 00:53.721
[grunting]

00:57.433 --> 00:59.476
[dogs barking]

00:59.560 --> 01:02.688
Shh! Shh!
Nice and quiet for me.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.697
[horses neighing and nickering]

01:17.494 --> 01:20.497
[somber music]

01:28.672 --> 01:29.924
Derfel...

01:31.007 --> 01:32.509
Oi!

01:32.593 --> 01:33.928
Derfel.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.557
Look...

01:39.350 --> 01:43.019
we should have never gone
to that mine, all right?

01:43.102 --> 01:45.272
It was a mistake,

01:45.356 --> 01:47.399
and no one's sorrier
that it happened than I am.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.987
But only the weak live
in the shadow of regret, son.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.907
Of what might have been.

01:57.368 --> 01:58.744
Yes, my Lord.

02:00.663 --> 02:04.750
It's a pity that dog
started barking, and...

02:04.833 --> 02:06.543
People had to die.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.588
A great pity.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.801
[Owain] But it's a burden
our death oaths compel us

02:13.884 --> 02:15.761
to bear together,
is it not?

02:17.428 --> 02:19.264
And there's honor
in that, no?

02:21.141 --> 02:24.770
Honor... and advancement,

02:24.853 --> 02:27.773
for one who would be a warlord
in the fullness of time.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.903
Go on.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.952
Thank you, my Lord.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.578
Good.

02:48.419 --> 02:53.424
[theme music]

02:59.430 --> 03:01.056
What of Merlin?

03:01.140 --> 03:03.100
Will he conduct
Mordred's Naming ceremony?

03:03.183 --> 03:06.520
-Read the augur?
-Well, I sent word to Avalon.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.730
He hasn't answered?

03:07.813 --> 03:09.398
I'll press him.

03:12.568 --> 03:15.446
The man to be sacrificed is
a thief and a murderer,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.906
but he has made his peace
with the Gods.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.451
We could just read
the blood of a dead man

03:20.534 --> 03:22.119
rather than a dying one.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.831
Well, where is the sacrifice
in cutting open a corpse?

03:25.914 --> 03:28.083
The spectacle, you mean.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.462
It's the way of things, Arthur.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.590
[Arthur] It was once
the way of things

03:34.673 --> 03:37.426
to put babes to the sword
who cried past midnight.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.520
Eh up, lad.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.356
Is that the sound

03:52.440 --> 03:55.360
of Dumnonia's coffers
being replenished?

03:55.444 --> 03:57.071
Clerks say we need it.

03:57.154 --> 04:00.657
All I can say is we took
five-score the gold from Cadwys

04:00.741 --> 04:03.452
than Uther ever managed.
Five-score.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.079
-Five-score?
-Why not?

04:05.162 --> 04:08.082
-Bastard was five years late.
-[laughing]

04:08.165 --> 04:09.708
[laughs]

04:11.001 --> 04:12.044
Derfel.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.671
Listen, no word of a lie,

04:14.755 --> 04:16.840
every town,
every single tribe,

04:16.924 --> 04:19.510
our haul was boosted
by this warlord in waiting,

04:19.593 --> 04:20.677
-weren't it, Raince?
-He helped us

04:20.761 --> 04:21.804
double our haul, Arthur.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.013
Are these tales true?

04:25.265 --> 04:26.600
I learned from a master.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.143
There you go.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.686
I hope he paid you
to say that.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.773
[laughing] Aye.

04:32.856 --> 04:33.857
How are you, Derfel?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.693
Very good, my Lord.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.737
Aye, he's good, he's good.

04:38.821 --> 04:41.740
Speaking of tales, I hear
your plan worked after all that.

04:41.824 --> 04:46.411
Gorfydd walks among us,
even if no one can tell me why.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.539
For now.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.749
-We should--
-[Owain] I hear he had

04:50.833 --> 04:51.959
some choice words
for you and all.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.628
Very fruity.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.171
And yet somehow

04:56.255 --> 04:58.882
you silenced him,
in front of everyone.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.009
Hm.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.720
Between now
and the Naming ceremony,

05:03.804 --> 05:06.849
we must keep our guests busy.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.893
Oh, aye? Entertained
and out of trouble, is it?

05:09.977 --> 05:12.479
We banish all thought
of politics.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.065
Leave it to me.
I know just the thing.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.942
Bit of fishing
in the Menis River, I think.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.069
Bring out the boys and the men.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.904
No frills, no horses,

05:20.988 --> 05:22.656
just shafts and spears

05:22.739 --> 05:25.075
and... the smack
of cold water.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.244
How's that sound?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.163
[Arthur] It's good
to have you back.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.497
Right then.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.792
Come on then, boys.
[claps]

05:48.182 --> 05:50.767
This humiliation
of my nephew

05:50.851 --> 05:52.769
serves no purpose

05:52.853 --> 05:54.229
and breaches your pact.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.736
It serves
a great purpose...

06:02.196 --> 06:03.822
justice.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.659
He is a rapist
and a murderer.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.245
And our pact was clear.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.497
I would spare his life,
nothing more.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.878
But I will see him
reunited with Ladwys.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.877
Nice of you to join us.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.754
Brushes and brooms inside.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.133
Can we expect you
at Mordred's Naming?

07:10.055 --> 07:11.765
Will you preside?

07:13.350 --> 07:16.812
No, you cannot expect me
at the Naming.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.190
The Tribe Kings will be there.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.067
Your absence, it...

07:23.277 --> 07:26.738
-it sends a message.
-It can't be helped.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.138
Where's Nimue?

07:52.264 --> 07:54.056
Following her own path.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.809
What does that mean?

07:59.730 --> 08:02.107
Where is she, Merlin?

08:04.359 --> 08:06.778
I hope my absence does
send a message.

08:11.867 --> 08:15.244
You will preside
over Mordred's Naming ceremony

08:15.329 --> 08:17.622
and perform the sacrifice.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.791
You are a druid
in all but name.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.380
I suggest you go
and get ready.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.688
[Morgan] Tell me
she's not in any danger.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.193
Go. Make your preparations.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.111
I will worry about Nimue.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.967
Your father took me
hunting once.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.929
I was a younger man,
and he was in his prime.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.306
-Where was your father?
-Oh, he stayed behind

09:16.389 --> 09:19.684
with the others. It was after
the first Saxon incursion.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.187
The kings gathered
and talked for days.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.773
King Cerdic sought a truce,
but only if the Saxons

09:24.856 --> 09:26.942
could keep the land
they'd taken.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.985
No one wanted war...

09:29.069 --> 09:31.154
and everyone had
a plan to avert it.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.948
My father grew restless.

09:33.031 --> 09:36.827
Violently impatient
would be nearer the mark.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.247
We rowed all day,
just the two of us,

09:40.330 --> 09:44.835
past Avalon,
up the Wydren Hills.

09:44.918 --> 09:49.256
And we talked.
Well, he talked, I listened.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.967
He said my father didn't
understand the Saxon.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.053
Nor did the Tribe Kings.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.266
He seized my shoulder,
and he...

09:59.349 --> 10:02.060
looked me dead in the eye,
and he said...

10:03.103 --> 10:05.814
"They don't want our gold.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.066
"They don't want peace."

10:08.150 --> 10:10.235
"They don't want
our princesses."

10:11.903 --> 10:13.405
"They want our land."

10:14.948 --> 10:16.366
"And they'll never stop,"

10:16.450 --> 10:18.201
till we drive them
into the sea."

10:19.953 --> 10:22.205
That knowledge was
his burden.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.999
Now it's yours.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.756
The Saxons are
massing in earnest.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.884
They're coming for us.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.470
[Gorfydd] For all his talk,
Uther did more

10:36.553 --> 10:39.514
to help that enemy
than any man alive.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.267
No one made
the case for union

10:42.350 --> 10:46.146
more passionately
or persuasively,

10:46.229 --> 10:47.981
but then he went
out of his way

10:48.064 --> 10:51.860
to demean the isle's
other great power.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.529
A strange way
to unite the tribes.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.574
That might explain my...

10:57.657 --> 11:01.036
intemperance
on my arrival.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.412
Was that an apology?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.789
A warning.

11:04.873 --> 11:08.293
If you want to build trust
between Dumnonia and Powys,

11:08.376 --> 11:11.254
it requires deeds,
not words.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.006
Releasing my nephew Gundleus

11:13.089 --> 11:15.133
would be a first step
on that path.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.513
You gave yourself away
the other night.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.892
Gundleus is a wild dog...

11:23.975 --> 11:25.560
but you hold his leash.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.896
Do you think I told him
to kill Norwenna

11:27.979 --> 11:29.314
and burn down Avalon?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.275
Do you deny it?

11:32.359 --> 11:35.028
I told him to burn down
Caer Cadarn.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.448
[pained groan]

11:49.334 --> 11:51.336
[groaning]

12:03.640 --> 12:05.517
He's a Saxon spy.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.852
He's been watching us
since we arrived.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.858
Derfel.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.986
[spy gasping]

12:17.237 --> 12:19.364
Ask him his name
and his business.

12:21.575 --> 12:26.162
[speaking Saxon]

12:27.581 --> 12:29.624
-[speaking Saxon]
-He says he's not permitted

12:29.708 --> 12:31.126
to tell us.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.961
[Arthur] Not permitted?

12:36.965 --> 12:38.508
Let me have a go.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.886
What are you doing here?

12:41.970 --> 12:44.180
You tell me, or so help me,
I'll beat the living--

12:44.264 --> 12:46.349
oh, hello.
What's this?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.561
Don't smile at me.
Don't smile at me.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.938
What is this?
Oh, does that sting a bit?

12:52.022 --> 12:55.984
Bit sore, is it?
Yeah? So...

12:56.067 --> 12:57.527
It's a map.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.447
[gasping]

13:00.530 --> 13:02.324
It charts
the southern regions,

13:02.407 --> 13:05.368
-in great detail.
-This is arable land.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.621
-What's he doing with this?
-What is your interest

13:07.704 --> 13:09.706
in our farms and produce?

13:09.789 --> 13:13.251
[speaking Saxon]

13:14.711 --> 13:16.630
[Arthur]
Did King Cerdic send you?

13:16.713 --> 13:18.632
[speaking Saxon]

13:18.715 --> 13:21.217
What about King Aelle?

13:21.301 --> 13:24.012
-[Derfel speaking Saxon]
-[Owain] Oh, yeah.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.097
That name meant something,
didn't it?

13:26.181 --> 13:27.599
You're one of Aelle's men.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.101
Aelle! Aelle!

13:31.436 --> 13:34.147
[continuing in Saxon]

13:35.315 --> 13:37.567
[speaking Saxon]

13:37.651 --> 13:42.197
[continuing in Saxon]

13:44.532 --> 13:47.702
[screams]

13:50.330 --> 13:52.165
[groaning]

14:03.385 --> 14:04.719
[scoffs]

14:06.763 --> 14:08.348
What did he say?

14:08.431 --> 14:11.101
He said,
"Aelle, Aelle...

14:11.184 --> 14:13.561
"He will kill you all..."

14:13.645 --> 14:15.689
"eat you alive..."

14:15.772 --> 14:18.483
raze your crops,
burn your young."

14:20.151 --> 14:22.987
This is a new stripe
of Saxon, this...

14:23.071 --> 14:24.989
this Aelle.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.075
Leader of men.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.245
Guess they weren't joking.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.058
[soft music]

15:35.935 --> 15:38.396
[muttering softly]

15:42.150 --> 15:44.110
[distant chatter]

15:57.791 --> 16:00.418
[distant chatter continues]

16:12.639 --> 16:14.766
[groaning]

16:22.941 --> 16:25.109
[horse neighing]

16:28.905 --> 16:31.199
What do you know
of this King Aelle?

16:31.282 --> 16:33.701
Ah, not much. Only that
he's new to these isles

16:33.785 --> 16:35.703
and he's eager
to make his mark.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.374
By the looks of it,
that work's begun.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.168
I wonder what King Cerdic
will say to that.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.464
Every army needs
new blood.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.258
The Saxons are no different.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.426
[Gorfydd] But they are
different, aren't they?

16:51.511 --> 16:52.887
Patient...

16:52.971 --> 16:55.139
meticulous...

16:55.223 --> 16:56.515
formidable.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.812
Just like Uther said.

17:05.441 --> 17:09.279
I spoke to Anna.
Her brother can build us a home.

17:13.283 --> 17:15.451
He needs materials, Derfel.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.791
All I have is Owain's gold.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.460
One piece will be enough
for him to make a start.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.504
Buy the wood.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.673
I don't know
that I want to.

17:29.549 --> 17:33.845
Innocent people died
that night, Lunete.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.638
And every time
I walk through the door,

17:35.722 --> 17:36.806
I'll think of them.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.268
Yes, for a time.

17:40.351 --> 17:41.728
And then you'll forget.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.314
I don't want to just
forget them.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.648
You don't get it.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.901
There's blood on these.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.361
[Lunete] If you don't
keep them,

17:50.445 --> 17:51.738
Owain will be slighted.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.533
And I'll no longer
be his man.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.788
What Owain said is true.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.207
You can't change the past.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.834
Only learn from it.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.971
[eerie music]

19:09.941 --> 19:11.442
Down there, my lord.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.406
Can I help you, sir?

19:18.616 --> 19:20.702
I am Prince Tristan
of Kernow

19:20.785 --> 19:22.036
and seek an audience

19:22.120 --> 19:23.579
with representatives
of Dumnonia.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.747
Very good.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.417
Of Kernow?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.296
[Tristan] Of Kernow.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.301
[raucous laughter and chatter]

19:44.851 --> 19:47.395
You stay here.
Stay here.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.356
Prince Tristan.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.693
You've come for Mordred's
Naming tomorrow

19:53.776 --> 19:55.403
and were doubtless delayed.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.030
Welcome...

20:00.158 --> 20:02.326
Who speaks
for Dumnonia, Bishop?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.959
[Bedwin] As a sworn protector,
I may speak as well

20:10.043 --> 20:11.878
as any on behalf
of King Mordred.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.590
Then hear this:
there will be blood

20:15.673 --> 20:17.467
between my kingdom and yours

20:17.550 --> 20:19.010
unless I receive justice.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.096
Well, forgive me,
Lord Prince,

20:22.180 --> 20:23.473
but this justice you...

20:23.556 --> 20:24.974
Spit it out, boy.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.853
Say what you have to say.

20:31.022 --> 20:32.732
A group
of my father's people

20:32.815 --> 20:35.068
came to Dumnonia,
at Uther's request,

20:35.151 --> 20:37.153
to work in the mines
and live in peace

20:37.236 --> 20:38.821
with their neighbors.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.074
But last week...

20:41.157 --> 20:43.576
some of those neighbors
came into their mine

20:43.659 --> 20:46.120
and gave them
sword and slaughter.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.499
A family dead.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.378
Their sarhaed will be
the value of their lives...

20:55.922 --> 20:58.424
plus the life of the man
who ordered them killed.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.675
Or else?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.805
Or else we will come
with our own swords and shields

21:03.888 --> 21:05.431
to take the price ourselves.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.016
[laughter]

21:07.100 --> 21:08.976
Please show our guest
some courtesy, please--

21:09.060 --> 21:10.520
[Owain] Alright, alright,
you heard the Bishop.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.730
Enough, enough.
Shut up.

21:14.232 --> 21:17.068
See, now, I heard
it were the Blackshield Irish

21:17.151 --> 21:18.861
who attacked the moor.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.531
Well, then they flew
across country to do it...

21:21.614 --> 21:23.699
no man saw them pass,
and they stole

21:23.783 --> 21:26.661
not so much as an egg
in Dumnonia.

21:26.744 --> 21:29.705
That's 'cause
they fear Dumnonia, see,

21:29.789 --> 21:34.001
but not... [sucks teeth]
...alas, Kernow.

21:35.545 --> 21:38.172
[Arthur] Do you know
of any tribe

21:38.256 --> 21:41.008
other than
the Blackshield...

21:41.092 --> 21:42.969
who might've
attacked your people?

21:48.057 --> 21:51.102
-Ask him.
-One more word out of you, boy,

21:51.185 --> 21:53.062
and I'll beat you
into your grave.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.648
Or better still,
ask the witness I have outside.

21:55.731 --> 21:59.443
Into you grave,
your lying son of a bitch!

22:01.237 --> 22:03.447
-[sheathing sword]
-If any man draws blood,

22:03.531 --> 22:05.116
he is my enemy.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.620
[sighing]

22:13.708 --> 22:15.042
Bring your witness.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.974
[man laughs]
A child!

22:30.057 --> 22:32.226
[sighs] He's brought
a little girl with him.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.812
-[man] That's a young...
-This is embarrassing, Arthur.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.651
[Tristan]
Sarlinna ferch Edain.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.158
Speak.

22:48.201 --> 22:52.038
My father was killed,
my mother was killed,

22:52.121 --> 22:54.123
my brothers were killed,

22:54.207 --> 22:56.209
my uncles were killed,

22:56.292 --> 22:58.711
and I saw it done.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.259
Wasn't the raid
at night-time, Sarlinna?

23:07.845 --> 23:09.263
How could you see?

23:10.806 --> 23:12.767
[Sarlinna]
Moon was almost full.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.774
How did you survive
the night?

23:19.857 --> 23:22.944
[Sarlinna] I hid,
Lord, under a pelt.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.821
[whispering]
You did well.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.658
But did you see the man
who killed your family?

23:28.741 --> 23:30.284
I saw him, Lord.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.703
He wore a string
of warrior rings.

23:34.330 --> 23:37.541
[soft laughter]

23:37.625 --> 23:39.043
I see what this is.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.795
This is...
you know what,

23:40.878 --> 23:42.880
you should be ashamed
of yourself, you should.

23:42.964 --> 23:44.632
Coming in here,
bringing a child in.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.969
You should be ashamed.
On my oath, she lies.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.179
Where I come from,
children who don't

23:50.263 --> 23:52.265
tell the truth are
usually thrashed soundly.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.058
-I'm sorry.
-[Bedwin] A child's word

23:54.141 --> 23:57.270
carries no weight in law.
A child is not among

23:57.353 --> 24:00.022
the tongued ones
but Lord Owain is.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.899
I believe this child.

24:03.776 --> 24:07.071
You let your priest prattle,
but it's you, they say...

24:07.154 --> 24:09.156
who is making Dumnonia anew.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.874
They exaggerate.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.878
Well, on this showing...

24:22.962 --> 24:25.172
I prefer the old one.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.925
Your father was ruthless...

24:28.009 --> 24:31.012
but he was fair.
Honest.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.724
The day after tomorrow, I will
come for Dumnonia's answer.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.144
[Owain] You can
have it now, son.

24:40.229 --> 24:44.025
If that answer denies
Kernow justice,

24:44.108 --> 24:46.777
I will challenge you myself,
Lord Owain.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.865
You're on.

24:51.949 --> 24:54.243
[soft laughter, muttering]

24:57.288 --> 25:00.124
[laughter increases, echoes]

25:02.877 --> 25:05.212
[Owain] Them dirty little
Kernow miners are as greedy

25:05.296 --> 25:08.090
as they are dishonest!
Do not pay them sarhaed,

25:08.174 --> 25:09.759
-Arthur, do you understand me?
-You think this is about money?

25:09.842 --> 25:11.093
Of course it is.
They're trying their luck!

25:11.177 --> 25:12.928
They haven't asked
for settlement.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.680
Well, that comes next, don't it?
They can't exactly go

25:14.764 --> 25:16.057
and ask the Blackshield Irish
for it, can they?

25:16.140 --> 25:17.308
They do well enough
from the mine.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.976
Oh, aye, they bloody do.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.936
Quite why Uther ever
granted such a pact,

25:21.020 --> 25:22.396
-that I will never know.
-Because he valued

25:22.480 --> 25:24.315
their skill,
and he saw an opportunity.

25:24.398 --> 25:26.108
Oh, yeah,
to give away our tin?!

25:26.192 --> 25:28.402
For mutual benefit.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.698
-Uther never gave anything away.
-Let me tell you.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.200
When you was gone
all them years...

25:34.283 --> 25:36.410
You were the only advocate
with my father.

25:36.494 --> 25:39.872
Advocate? I was the only one
who'd speak your name.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.290
You think
Bedwin pled your case?

25:41.374 --> 25:43.793
Your sister?
No, mm-mm.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.378
Just me.

25:45.461 --> 25:49.048
Oh yeah, Uther would scream
like a scolded dog.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.758
"Say that bastard's
name again,

25:50.841 --> 25:53.219
and you'll join him
in banishment!"

25:53.302 --> 25:54.762
I didn't care.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.807
'Cause you were my friend,

25:57.890 --> 26:00.351
and he wronged you,
Pendragon or no.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.312
I owe you a debt.

26:03.396 --> 26:07.817
Your loyalty
and your trust is enough.

26:12.196 --> 26:16.325
I did not set foot
in that mine.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.286
You have my word.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.218
[gasping]

26:48.858 --> 26:50.443
I had to do it.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.241
You could've killed yourself.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.498
I've defied the Gods.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.266
Mandrake, for the fever.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.438
Belladonna for the pain.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.443
Now we've both defied them.

27:37.281 --> 27:41.202
[distant coughing]

27:43.162 --> 27:47.833
[coughing]

27:54.381 --> 27:56.300
Coltsfoot steeped in mead.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.303
To calm your cough.

28:01.472 --> 28:05.100
You would cure me
and kill me?

28:05.184 --> 28:09.188
I would see you healthy,
to greet the Gods.

28:10.147 --> 28:13.108
And in full voice
when you slit me open.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.239
You won't die in vain.

28:18.322 --> 28:21.951
Your blood will reveal
the path of the Edling King.

28:30.543 --> 28:33.337
[coughs]

28:39.051 --> 28:40.636
Will it be quick?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.304
No.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.974
But you have done it before?

28:47.560 --> 28:49.228
The sacrifice?

28:55.067 --> 28:59.446
A hunt, a feast...
another feast.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.991
Can't recall the last time
I had so much fun.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.202
I'm glad.

29:05.286 --> 29:08.914
So, Owain denies the charge?

29:09.832 --> 29:13.168
Lays the blame
with Oengus Mac Airem

29:13.252 --> 29:14.920
and the Blackshield Irish?

29:17.464 --> 29:19.008
Owain and others.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.469
I know Oengus of old.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.641
Please, share your thoughts.

29:27.725 --> 29:30.060
[laughing]
The Blackshield Irish...

29:30.144 --> 29:32.605
are worse than they say
and as bad as they come.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.608
They'll kill you
for the teeth in your head

29:35.691 --> 29:37.318
and the breath
in your lungs.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.069
And your nephew
Gundleus wouldn't?

29:39.153 --> 29:42.281
[laughing]
They have much in common,

29:42.364 --> 29:44.992
I agree, their land is
small and arid,

29:45.075 --> 29:48.954
compelling them to...
roam abroad.

29:50.289 --> 29:53.667
I've never heard plunder
described so poetically.

29:53.751 --> 29:57.379
Ah, says the scion
of the isle's bountiful state.

30:03.594 --> 30:07.139
We have a long-held pact
with the Blackshield Irish

30:07.222 --> 30:10.351
not to raid
our borders and our towns.

30:10.434 --> 30:14.396
Right now, Oengus is
on the Hibernian Coast.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.233
Why would he risk life and limb
crossing Dumnonia

30:18.317 --> 30:20.319
in the dead of night,

30:20.402 --> 30:22.196
to raid a tin mine?

30:25.324 --> 30:28.035
When was the last time
you saw Oengus?

30:28.118 --> 30:30.079
Two, three years ago.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.289
Mm. Long time.

30:33.415 --> 30:35.584
Perhaps he's changed
his routine.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.464
[laughing]

30:55.604 --> 30:57.606
[Nimue] Sulis will punish me.

30:58.816 --> 31:00.651
If not Sulis,

31:00.734 --> 31:02.986
Rosmerta,
the goddess of fertility.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.701
[horse nickers]

31:08.784 --> 31:10.994
I can't say, Nimue.

31:13.664 --> 31:17.000
The Gods will not be denied,
much less defied.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.128
How many times
have you told me that?

31:21.088 --> 31:22.464
I don't care.

31:24.341 --> 31:25.592
I'm free.

31:28.262 --> 31:31.181
I would not see them
vent their anger on you.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.519
The Gods are not
without mercy.

31:38.731 --> 31:41.400
And I have
one small cause for hope.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.778
They led me here.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.074
Come.

31:52.828 --> 31:56.039
[rousing music]

32:06.592 --> 32:10.471
When you wear the crown
or affect to,

32:10.554 --> 32:12.514
it's your friends
who truly test you,

32:12.598 --> 32:14.141
not your enemies.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.352
If your pride allows,

32:17.436 --> 32:20.397
I can instruct you
here and there.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.860
A very kind offer,

32:24.943 --> 32:27.654
but I have no desire
to wear the crown.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.825
I am doing what must be done.

for Mordred.

32:37.790 --> 32:40.542
The question is, what are you
going to do about it?

32:40.626 --> 32:43.420
Will you put all that fine talk
of truth and justice

32:43.504 --> 32:46.256
into practice,
or was that just poetry?

Gundleus has
a right to be there.

32:55.516 --> 32:56.850
A right?

32:56.934 --> 32:59.102
Without him,
there'd be no ceremony.

32:59.186 --> 33:00.771
Mercy is the midwife
of progress,

33:00.854 --> 33:03.232
but invite him
to the Naming ceremony

he tried to kill?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.902
Never.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.654
He is my nephew.

33:09.655 --> 33:13.659
To disrespect him...
is to disrespect me.

33:13.742 --> 33:17.621
If Gundleus causes you to feel
the taint of association,

33:17.704 --> 33:19.706

33:59.872 --> 34:01.289

34:01.373 --> 34:02.916
Better than well
at Cadwys' hall.

34:04.918 --> 34:07.504
May I see that tally stick?

34:07.588 --> 34:09.548
Yes, my Lord.

34:09.631 --> 34:14.845
Ahh... Cadwys, Cadwys...

34:30.402 --> 34:33.196
Coin and gold only account
for half your haul.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.867
How did the old rascal pay
for the rest?

34:37.868 --> 34:40.203

34:48.754 --> 34:49.755

34:51.548 --> 34:55.469
Mm... so it was.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.848
Made quite a mess
of this one, didn't you?

35:01.725 --> 35:04.436

35:04.519 --> 35:07.731

over and over...

seems neither clever
nor meticulous.

35:13.070 --> 35:16.865
Cadwys promised
more than he delivered.

35:16.949 --> 35:20.827
-And you fell for that?
-Only a close inventory

35:20.911 --> 35:25.707
of the hall revealed
his true deception in the light,

35:25.791 --> 35:29.252
and so I adjusted
the tally accordingly.

35:33.340 --> 35:34.800

To fight battles, Lord.

43:29.274 --> 43:32.318
To fight battles
on behalf to those

43:32.402 --> 43:34.028
who cannot fight
for themselves.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.407
I learnt that in Brittany.

43:38.575 --> 43:40.994
Our task is
to leave Mordred

43:41.077 --> 43:44.038
with a rich
and a peaceful kingdom.

43:44.122 --> 43:47.000
But to do that,
we must first have

43:47.083 --> 43:49.335
a good and a just kingdom.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.047
We cannot have peace
if we break our treaties,

43:53.131 --> 43:54.757
and the treaty
that let the men of Kernow

43:54.841 --> 43:57.260

a good treaty.

-Let's assume...

44:09.564 --> 44:11.149

If he could not
be talked...

Lord Owain...

44:17.155 --> 44:18.573
he will lose.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.158
Even the Gods would
find it hard

44:20.241 --> 44:22.202
to make him beat down
Owain's sword.

44:23.453 --> 44:25.830
But is that fair?

44:27.499 --> 44:29.876
We would lose, too.

and all the good things
that follow it...

that you can do for me.

must know that
