WEBVTT

00:36.267 --> 00:38.637
I'm gonna go on up.

00:53.584 --> 00:55.853
Try to stop thinking about it.

01:00.792 --> 01:04.596
It's just these... these doctors.

01:07.097 --> 01:11.936
Never knowing whether or not
they're telling the truth.

01:15.773 --> 01:20.145
Charles, you worry
as if that's gonna help,

01:20.178 --> 01:23.148
as if there's something
you can do about it.

01:25.315 --> 01:27.818
I just feel so helpless.

01:31.356 --> 01:35.961
I've always been able to take
care of my own problems, Gloria.

01:38.896 --> 01:41.767
Put it in His hands, Charles.

01:43.735 --> 01:46.837
There's no problem
He can't solve.

01:46.871 --> 01:50.809
There's no miracle
He can't perform...

01:50.842 --> 01:53.045
if we have faith.

01:59.116 --> 02:02.853
You get a good night's sleep.

02:02.887 --> 02:06.124
I guarantee you won't feel
like this in the morning.

03:21.299 --> 03:22.333
Gloria?

03:26.304 --> 03:27.972
Hm?

03:28.005 --> 03:29.807
Something the matter?

03:32.910 --> 03:34.946
There's someone in the house.

06:28.686 --> 06:30.589
Don't let her die.

06:36.393 --> 06:38.229
Don't let her die.

07:22.573 --> 07:24.609
It's so warm!

08:05.148 --> 08:06.650
Uh, to tell you the truth,

08:06.684 --> 08:10.188
I'm not 100 percent sure
I'm ready to be a landlord.

08:12.523 --> 08:16.261
Since you're here,
you might as well have a look.

08:19.129 --> 08:22.532
I assume you have references.

08:22.566 --> 08:26.237
If you don't mind my asking,
how old are you?

08:26.270 --> 08:30.041
You seem a little old
for a sophomore.

08:30.073 --> 08:31.643
I got sidetracked.

08:33.109 --> 08:34.345
Military service.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.149
Oh, what branch?

08:39.383 --> 08:42.253
Army.

08:42.286 --> 08:44.522
Got laid up with an injury.

08:44.555 --> 08:47.025
Long rehab.

08:47.057 --> 08:48.659
Hate to hear that.

08:50.760 --> 08:54.064
At least you made it back
in one piece.

08:59.269 --> 09:03.508
You said something
about references.

09:03.541 --> 09:06.344
Got your military ID on you?

09:06.377 --> 09:07.378
Yes, sir.

09:07.411 --> 09:10.214
That's reference enough for me.

09:10.247 --> 09:14.752
You want the place,
rent's due first of the month.

09:14.784 --> 09:17.754
Move in now?

09:17.787 --> 09:20.124
Looks like you're already in.

09:25.296 --> 09:27.465
Jonathan Wyndham.

09:27.498 --> 09:29.267
Clement Greene.

09:36.373 --> 09:38.142
All settled?

09:38.175 --> 09:40.777
Yes, thank you.

09:42.245 --> 09:44.114
Feels strange having someone

09:44.148 --> 09:47.350
living in this room again.

09:47.383 --> 09:48.686
You have a son.

09:48.719 --> 09:50.354
I do.

09:53.523 --> 09:57.595
In fact, I have 37 kids.

10:00.598 --> 10:03.633
When our own went to college
and moved on,

10:03.667 --> 10:05.802
Sheila and I...
that was Mrs. Greene...

10:05.835 --> 10:07.772
became foster parents,

10:07.805 --> 10:10.575
mostly kids transitioning
through the system:

10:10.608 --> 10:14.679
37, 36 plus Christopher.

10:14.711 --> 10:16.813
Thirty-seven.

10:16.846 --> 10:20.350
We were aiming for 40,
and then...

10:20.383 --> 10:22.353
Sheila got sick.

10:30.594 --> 10:32.430
Where are your people?

10:34.330 --> 10:36.267
<i>There's just me.</i>

10:46.676 --> 10:49.714
Ah, Harvest Social tonight.

10:49.747 --> 10:51.782
Big street party on campus.

10:51.815 --> 10:54.886
Why don't you get out
and go explore?

10:56.486 --> 10:58.421
Good evening.

10:58.455 --> 11:02.225
We have an unexpected treat
for you tonight.

11:02.258 --> 11:04.695
Someone who's done more
than anyone I know

11:04.728 --> 11:08.199
to protect the heritage
and the integrity

11:08.231 --> 11:09.900
of our great state.

11:09.933 --> 11:15.238
Please, welcome Chief Justice
Melanie Merrill.

11:19.509 --> 11:22.712
<i>Ah, Jonathan,
I wasn't sure you'd pick up.</i>

11:22.745 --> 11:25.850
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to ask a favor.

11:25.883 --> 11:29.186
<i>I ran off and I left
my notebook on the table</i>

11:29.220 --> 11:31.855
<i>with some papers in there that
I need to give to somebody.</i>

11:31.888 --> 11:34.524
...but across this beautiful
state of ours.

11:34.557 --> 11:35.825
I can't get away.

11:35.859 --> 11:38.696
Any chance that you
could drop 'em by?

11:38.729 --> 11:42.532
The Women's Club,
the Harvest Social.

11:42.566 --> 11:45.902
Yeah, could you come now?

11:45.936 --> 11:51.776
I know it's a lot to ask,
but it really would help me out.

11:51.808 --> 11:54.344
- Thanks.
- ...to which we have said...

11:54.378 --> 11:58.849
- Yeah, yeah, see you in a few.
- No, thank you, not in Alabama!

12:10.561 --> 12:12.629
Hello, dear.

12:12.662 --> 12:14.632
Where have you been?

12:14.665 --> 12:17.702
- I never see you.
- I've been busy.

12:17.734 --> 12:21.404
Margaret, I am so glad
that you could make it.

12:21.437 --> 12:23.407
Margaret is working
with Humanities

12:23.440 --> 12:25.276
to secure funding
for her program.

12:25.308 --> 12:26.977
- Is she?
- Yes, she is.

12:27.010 --> 12:31.648
Tell me, James, where would you
put my chances right now?

12:33.350 --> 12:35.786
Well, you know, uh,

12:35.819 --> 12:38.489
there are many factors
to be considered.

12:38.522 --> 12:42.260
Oh, well, now, I'm sure
that with a good word

12:42.292 --> 12:43.628
from the right people

12:43.661 --> 12:48.032
that Margaret could have
anything she wanted.

12:48.065 --> 12:50.968
If only she'd ask.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.537
It's all a matter
of ambition, dear.

12:54.571 --> 12:56.306
I'll keep that in mind.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.506
Well, if you'll follow me,
I would love

12:58.508 --> 13:00.644
to have you meet
the new member on the board.

13:00.677 --> 13:01.712
All right.

13:06.417 --> 13:07.918
Look at you.

13:11.888 --> 13:14.859
Would it kill you
to wear some makeup?

13:34.110 --> 13:39.984
<i>I will twine, I will mingle
my raven black hair</i>

13:40.017 --> 13:46.056
<i>With the roses so red
and the lilies so fair</i>

13:46.090 --> 13:51.429
<i>And the myrtle so bright
with the emerald hue</i>

13:51.461 --> 13:52.929
<i>The pale amanita...</i>

13:52.963 --> 13:54.965
Hi, I'm just looking
to drop this off...

13:54.998 --> 13:56.934
Jonathan, you're a life-saver!

13:56.966 --> 13:58.535
Come have a drink
while you're here.

13:58.569 --> 14:00.404
- Ah, no, I'll head out.
- Nonsense!

14:00.436 --> 14:03.007
You went to all the trouble
of coming here.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.710
Wait, you didn't sign in!

14:05.743 --> 14:09.113
Jonathan, this is Margaret.

14:09.146 --> 14:11.482
Margaret, this is, uh...

14:11.514 --> 14:14.651
my roommate, at least
for the semester, Jonathan.

14:14.685 --> 14:17.688
<i>...my idols were clay</i>

14:17.720 --> 14:19.123
What's wrong?

14:19.156 --> 14:20.891
Nothing's wrong.

14:20.923 --> 14:24.627
What could be wrong?
Everything's perfectly fine.

14:26.129 --> 14:29.133
I'll be right back.

14:29.166 --> 14:31.936
Don't let her drink anymore.

14:31.969 --> 14:35.004
<i>...and promised to love</i>

14:35.037 --> 14:39.976
<i>And to cherish me
over all others above</i>

14:40.009 --> 14:43.114
I'm gonna get another one.
You want one?

14:43.147 --> 14:45.416
No.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.551
Suit yourself.

14:47.584 --> 14:49.053
Margaret...

14:49.085 --> 14:51.989
<i>No words of farewell</i>

14:53.657 --> 14:54.892
Margaret!

14:57.494 --> 15:00.797
Now I know what Clement
said to you.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.499
He thinks I'm drunk.

15:02.532 --> 15:05.469
He told you to stop me
if I get another drink.

15:09.605 --> 15:12.008
Well, who does he think he is?

15:12.042 --> 15:15.112
And who the hell are you?

15:15.144 --> 15:17.080
I am Jonathan Wyndham.

15:17.114 --> 15:19.383
<i>...his wildwood flower</i>

15:20.817 --> 15:24.654
And I'm a threat
to everyone around me.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.994
Ah, Clement.

15:32.528 --> 15:34.064
Shit.

15:40.604 --> 15:43.107
When were you discharged?

15:43.139 --> 15:44.841
Who said I was...

15:47.610 --> 15:50.947
January.

15:50.980 --> 15:52.549
Conditional?

15:52.582 --> 15:55.685
Honorable.

15:55.719 --> 15:57.821
Two tours of active combat.

15:57.854 --> 16:01.024
Second Battalion, 7th Cav.

16:01.057 --> 16:03.527
I might've served a third,
but my unit was ambushed

16:03.560 --> 16:07.231
during Operation Al-Fajr.

16:07.263 --> 16:11.167
Seven men killed.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.204
I was the only survivor.

16:16.907 --> 16:19.477
Captured...

16:19.509 --> 16:20.544
and tortured.

16:23.013 --> 16:24.548
I would've been killed.

16:26.582 --> 16:30.019
I was the next in line.

16:30.052 --> 16:31.821
<i>The cameras were rolling.</i>

16:33.757 --> 16:36.794
I was looking
into the guy's eyes.

16:36.826 --> 16:39.028
Could smell his cologne.

16:39.061 --> 16:41.499
He asked me...
He asked me if...

16:44.133 --> 16:46.936
- <i>What happened?</i>
- <i>And fire.</i>

16:46.970 --> 16:48.772
- <i>Missiles away.</i>
- <i>Hellfire strike</i>

16:48.805 --> 16:52.142
took out the entire stronghold,

16:52.175 --> 16:54.178
<i>blew off the roof,
tore out the walls,</i>

16:54.210 --> 16:55.178
<i>everyone killed...</i>

16:56.680 --> 16:58.149
<i>...except one.</i>

17:00.149 --> 17:02.552
Severe TBI.

17:02.585 --> 17:04.254
<i>Three months in Brookhaven
where they cracked...</i>

17:04.287 --> 17:06.823
Shut the fuck up.

17:06.856 --> 17:11.060
<i>In the joyous days of childhood</i>

17:11.094 --> 17:12.863
I'm sorry.

17:12.896 --> 17:14.632
I didn't mean shut up,

17:14.665 --> 17:16.800
I just meant...

17:16.832 --> 17:21.170
Look, these people,

17:21.204 --> 17:23.139
they can't hear that.

17:23.173 --> 17:25.743
They don't understand.

17:25.775 --> 17:28.545
Shit.

17:28.579 --> 17:29.812
Hello, James.

17:29.846 --> 17:31.815
Margaret, I hope you don't think

17:31.848 --> 17:33.584
that I was hedging before.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.185
It's just that...

17:35.217 --> 17:36.820
James Newhall, this is...

17:36.852 --> 17:39.889
Jonathan Wyndham!

17:39.923 --> 17:41.258
You know,

17:41.291 --> 17:43.694
"The Last Man Standing."

17:43.726 --> 17:45.562
Fox did this whole big special.

17:45.596 --> 17:46.697
Wow!

17:47.863 --> 17:48.998
I'm honored.

17:49.032 --> 17:50.667
Oh, thank you for your service,

17:50.701 --> 17:52.102
first of all.

17:52.135 --> 17:54.872
Is he one of yours?

17:54.905 --> 17:56.607
No, I, I just...

17:56.639 --> 18:00.109
Well, if Jonathan Wyndham
were on your team...

18:00.142 --> 18:03.947
<i>Songs of heaven which you sang
with childish voice</i>

18:03.981 --> 18:06.884
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, and, uh,

18:06.917 --> 18:09.919
welcome to New Canaan.

18:09.953 --> 18:11.288
Talk soon.

18:11.321 --> 18:15.158
<i>Or are songs of earth
your choice?</i>

18:15.192 --> 18:17.027
<i>Will the circle be unbroken</i>

18:17.060 --> 18:19.629
- All right...
- Hang on.

18:19.663 --> 18:24.335
- <i>By and by, Lord, by and by</i>
- Wait.

18:24.368 --> 18:26.102
This is me.

18:26.136 --> 18:27.738
This is where we meet.

18:27.771 --> 18:29.673
Tuesdays at 7.

18:29.705 --> 18:33.343
If you wanna drop by, drop by.

18:33.377 --> 18:35.244
I don't understand.

18:35.278 --> 18:36.914
Clement told you, right?

18:36.946 --> 18:39.350
The support group?

18:39.382 --> 18:41.150
It's group therapy.

18:41.184 --> 18:43.954
I connect veterans
with service providers.

18:43.986 --> 18:47.657
DDs and OTHs mostly,
but even general discharges

18:47.690 --> 18:49.826
have to fight for benefits
these days.

18:49.859 --> 18:51.829
It's criminal.

18:51.861 --> 18:53.397
Margaret Merrill?

18:53.429 --> 18:56.132
That's right.

18:56.166 --> 18:59.669
Any relation to Judge Merrill?

18:59.703 --> 19:02.138
You mean Justice Merrill.

19:02.171 --> 19:04.874
Yeah, she used to be my mother.

19:04.907 --> 19:07.343
<i>In the sky</i>

19:07.377 --> 19:09.713
<i>Will the circle be unbroken</i>

19:09.745 --> 19:11.881
Maybe I'll see you Tuesday?

19:11.915 --> 19:13.783
<i>By and by, Lord, by and by</i>

19:13.817 --> 19:16.686
Yeah. Maybe.

19:16.719 --> 19:20.723
<i>There's a better home awaiting</i>

19:20.756 --> 19:23.960
<i>In the sky, Lord, in the sky</i>

19:31.333 --> 19:34.671
You turned
the security bolt again.

19:34.705 --> 19:36.740
I need you to unlock it.

19:40.711 --> 19:42.780
Dad?

19:42.812 --> 19:45.448
Is everything all right?

19:59.428 --> 20:02.800
Jesus, Holy Mary...

20:19.116 --> 20:25.155
Please don't hurt the baby!

20:25.187 --> 20:26.456
He's my grandson.

20:28.324 --> 20:30.093
He's my daughter's boy.

20:31.494 --> 20:35.032
She's been through so much.

20:35.064 --> 20:38.067
She would just die
if something happened to him.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.235
We all would.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.877
The only way to punish them
for the past...

20:52.081 --> 20:54.851
...is to deprive them
of the future.

21:02.359 --> 21:03.393
No!

21:03.426 --> 21:05.128
It won't hurt at all.

21:07.296 --> 21:09.098
I promise.

21:28.984 --> 21:32.289
<i>Walk right in, sit right down</i>

21:32.321 --> 21:34.957
<i>Daddy, let your mind roll on</i>

21:39.361 --> 21:42.465
<i>Daddy, let your mind roll on</i>

21:45.836 --> 21:47.337
Help them!

21:47.369 --> 21:48.972
Help them.

22:16.498 --> 22:19.068
Jonathan.

22:19.101 --> 22:21.905
I was worried about you.

22:21.937 --> 22:23.873
Why?

22:23.907 --> 22:26.143
Well, just...

22:26.176 --> 22:28.544
strange days, that's all.

22:28.578 --> 22:30.981
<i>It's all happening
right now on Route 46,</i>

22:31.013 --> 22:33.483
<i>so shop today
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.</i>

22:33.515 --> 22:35.185
<i>and tomorrow from noon...</i>

22:35.217 --> 22:38.154
What do you know
about Margaret Merrill?

22:38.187 --> 22:40.190
Margaret Merrill?

22:42.225 --> 22:43.593
Never mind.

22:46.428 --> 22:48.165
Jonathan?

22:51.434 --> 22:53.337
Too late for a cup of coffee?

22:57.540 --> 22:59.176
Never too late.

23:01.677 --> 23:04.147
Sit. Relax.

23:13.356 --> 23:15.559
You called me to the party

23:15.591 --> 23:19.161
so you could introduce me
to her.

23:19.195 --> 23:20.563
Why?

23:20.597 --> 23:24.635
You don't beat around
the bush much, do you?

23:24.667 --> 23:27.937
Was it so I could get treatment

23:27.971 --> 23:30.440
in her group?

23:30.473 --> 23:35.446
Or so I could help her
secure funding for her program?

23:39.182 --> 23:41.618
Maybe both.

23:41.650 --> 23:43.253
Maybe neither.

23:43.285 --> 23:44.921
To tell you the truth,
I don't know why.

23:44.955 --> 23:46.657
You just strike me
as a couple people

23:46.689 --> 23:50.559
that might have something
in common and...

23:50.592 --> 23:53.930
get along together.

23:53.964 --> 23:55.232
Is she married?

23:55.264 --> 23:56.300
No.

23:58.702 --> 24:01.371
Seeing someone?

24:01.404 --> 24:04.174
Oh, um, a...

24:08.278 --> 24:11.081
Margaret is a...

24:11.113 --> 24:14.650
<i>complicated individual.</i>

24:14.684 --> 24:16.420
<i>Was born and raised
in this town,</i>

24:16.453 --> 24:19.356
<i>yet she never really fit in.</i>

24:19.388 --> 24:24.527
<i>Maybe that's why she's so good
with people who, uh,</i>

24:24.561 --> 24:28.165
<i>have trouble adjusting.</i>

24:28.197 --> 24:29.399
Like me.

24:31.501 --> 24:32.970
Yeah.

25:26.822 --> 25:29.692
You're thinking
what I'm thinking,

25:29.725 --> 25:31.361
aren't you?

25:44.541 --> 25:46.443
Hello?

25:47.474 --> 25:48.210
<i>I'll be out in a second.</i>

25:48.244 --> 25:49.679
<i>Just cleaning up.</i>

25:56.619 --> 25:58.821
Oh.

25:58.855 --> 26:00.824
Tuesday night.

26:00.857 --> 26:02.658
You're a little late.

26:06.696 --> 26:10.100
Um, you know,
regardless of the impression

26:10.132 --> 26:11.834
you may have gotten
the other night,

26:11.868 --> 26:14.503
I'm not looking to recruit you.

26:14.536 --> 26:17.706
You know, as advocate
or spokesperson

26:17.740 --> 26:19.242
or anything like that,

26:19.274 --> 26:23.446
so if that's why
you didn't come to the meeting,

26:23.480 --> 26:25.615
don't let that discourage you.

26:25.648 --> 26:28.118
No, I know that.

26:28.150 --> 26:31.487
I wanted to see you.

26:31.521 --> 26:33.389
Sure.

26:33.423 --> 26:35.526
Tell me what's going on.

26:40.496 --> 26:41.864
I...

26:44.199 --> 26:47.571
I'm interested in seeing you.

26:47.603 --> 26:49.172
Okay.

26:51.608 --> 26:53.376
I appreciate you
coming out here,

26:53.408 --> 26:57.446
although I would've preferred
you come to the actual meeting,

26:57.480 --> 26:59.616
but...

26:59.648 --> 27:02.284
this sort of thing

27:02.318 --> 27:04.588
isn't permitted
between group leader

27:04.620 --> 27:06.790
and participants.

27:06.822 --> 27:09.426
I know.

27:09.458 --> 27:11.794
That's why I didn't come
to the meeting.

27:20.336 --> 27:22.772
Listen...

27:22.804 --> 27:24.807
You seem like
a nice enough guy, Jonathan,

27:24.840 --> 27:26.743
but I'm just getting
the feeling...

27:26.775 --> 27:28.544
Good or bad?

27:31.747 --> 27:34.250
Um...

27:34.283 --> 27:37.487
Good night, Jonathan.
Thank you for stopping by.

27:39.821 --> 27:42.426
I didn't mean anything by it.

27:52.635 --> 27:54.605
Hold up a second.

27:57.372 --> 27:58.741
You...

28:03.780 --> 28:08.618
Do you have anyone
you can talk to?

28:08.650 --> 28:11.220
Other people
with shared experience.

28:11.253 --> 28:13.322
Shared experience?

28:17.359 --> 28:20.330
No one from my unit survived.

28:24.801 --> 28:27.838
No one can understand
what I went through.

28:35.445 --> 28:36.914
One drink.

29:33.802 --> 29:35.438
Well?

29:39.074 --> 29:40.542
What?

29:40.576 --> 29:43.980
Is she interested in you or not?

29:44.013 --> 29:45.782
You know me.

29:45.814 --> 29:49.285
I can never tell.

29:49.319 --> 29:51.655
But I think...

29:51.687 --> 29:52.955
maybe.

29:54.623 --> 29:56.592
You'll make her interested.

29:56.626 --> 29:58.061
You'll find a way.

29:58.093 --> 29:59.929
I'll help.

30:02.831 --> 30:05.034
Judge Merrill's daughter.

30:05.068 --> 30:08.305
We were looking for a way,
and now we have it.

30:10.039 --> 30:13.042
Oh, we're going to twist
the knife

30:13.076 --> 30:17.848
right inside
her baby girl's heart.

30:23.519 --> 30:24.821
Jonathan?

30:27.823 --> 30:29.058
Yes?

30:33.061 --> 30:34.930
Don't.

30:50.646 --> 30:51.981
Girls!

30:52.013 --> 30:54.383
You're going to be late
for church.

31:00.956 --> 31:04.927
Whoa, whoa,
you're gonna need warmer coats.

31:04.961 --> 31:06.563
They're in the back chifforobe.

31:06.596 --> 31:09.032
Okay.

31:49.105 --> 31:50.573
- Here.
- I'm tired of you

31:50.606 --> 31:51.907
acting like such a baby, Louisa.

31:51.940 --> 31:54.777
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

31:56.545 --> 31:57.446
Please!

31:57.480 --> 31:59.049
What's wrong?

32:07.924 --> 32:10.060
You will not harm these girls.

32:11.494 --> 32:12.962
You will leave this house at...

32:15.965 --> 32:17.199
Look at me.

32:18.634 --> 32:20.870
Can you see me?

32:20.903 --> 32:23.773
Do you know the name Berenice?

32:23.805 --> 32:27.075
She was a nine-year-old
little girl.

32:27.109 --> 32:29.545
Do you remember her?

32:38.119 --> 32:40.556
Oh, yes.

32:40.590 --> 32:41.991
She remembers.

33:07.015 --> 33:10.753
In Jesus's name, spare me!

33:35.176 --> 33:37.679
Jonathan!

33:37.713 --> 33:39.249
There are witnesses!

33:39.282 --> 33:41.818
They're innocent.

33:41.850 --> 33:44.720
They're just little girls.

33:44.753 --> 33:46.656
So was I, Jonathan.

33:46.688 --> 33:48.624
Remember?

33:48.657 --> 33:50.059
No.

33:50.091 --> 33:52.027
How could you?

33:52.061 --> 33:54.630
You weren't there.

34:37.906 --> 34:39.174
Where are you going?

34:43.846 --> 34:46.648
I'm supposed to be
a student here, right?

34:46.681 --> 34:47.950
Can I come?

34:50.819 --> 34:52.688
If I'm with you...

34:54.824 --> 34:57.694
...I look at you
and talk to you,

34:57.726 --> 35:00.228
people see that and think
I'm having some kind of...

35:00.261 --> 35:02.297
Fine.

35:02.331 --> 35:03.800
I'll stay.

35:07.770 --> 35:10.373
Just don't forget...

35:10.406 --> 35:12.375
who she is.

35:15.944 --> 35:20.850
<i>You're safe when
you're sleeping</i>

35:20.882 --> 35:24.987
<i>Never, never knew</i>

35:25.020 --> 35:26.822
Hey.

35:26.855 --> 35:28.591
How long have you been here?

35:31.860 --> 35:35.665
You could actually come
to the meeting, you know.

35:35.697 --> 35:39.636
What is it you think we do
in there anyway?

35:39.668 --> 35:41.237
We just talk.

35:41.270 --> 35:43.139
We listen.

35:43.172 --> 35:45.007
We drink too much coffee.

35:46.875 --> 35:49.711
I don't know,
I'm a private person.

35:49.744 --> 35:51.313
Private or withdrawn?

35:51.346 --> 35:53.982
Thanks.

35:54.016 --> 35:55.284
You know, Jonathan,
the only way you're gonna make...

35:55.317 --> 35:56.386
Stop.

36:01.290 --> 36:04.027
Well?

36:04.060 --> 36:07.230
This is why I don't go inside.

36:07.263 --> 36:11.400
Last thing I need is
somebody else inside my head.

36:11.433 --> 36:14.436
Okay.

36:14.469 --> 36:16.406
Just so you know,

36:16.438 --> 36:19.676
I'm not looking to mindfuck you.

36:22.177 --> 36:26.348
You gotta understand, when I
find someone interesting, I...

36:26.382 --> 36:29.252
I wanna know more about them.

36:29.284 --> 36:31.788
I mean, you might call it
getting inside your head,

36:31.821 --> 36:35.958
but... I call it
getting to know someone.

36:42.732 --> 36:44.900
If we're gonna do this,

36:44.933 --> 36:49.705
I mean, whatever this
turns out to be,

36:49.739 --> 36:52.208
you don't get to call timeout.

36:52.241 --> 36:55.143
It doesn't work that way.

36:55.177 --> 36:59.348
You call timeout,
the game's over, okay?

36:59.380 --> 37:00.783
Okay.

37:03.152 --> 37:05.788
If I want in,

37:05.821 --> 37:09.726
you gotta let me in.

37:09.759 --> 37:11.159
But that...

37:11.192 --> 37:13.128
That works both ways, right?

37:13.161 --> 37:14.797
Absolutely.

37:16.931 --> 37:18.734
If you're allowed
to get inside me,

37:18.768 --> 37:21.471
then I'm allowed
to get inside you.

37:22.804 --> 37:23.806
I'm sorry.

37:23.839 --> 37:27.243
Um, no, no, uh, don't apologize.

37:31.313 --> 37:32.816
No?

37:36.018 --> 37:37.387
No.

38:45.087 --> 38:48.224
Let me take some of the pressure
off you, Jonathan.

38:48.257 --> 38:50.960
I don't know what you think
that was, but...

38:50.993 --> 38:52.862
it was only a kiss.

38:57.199 --> 38:59.202
It didn't mean anything?

39:02.371 --> 39:04.139
It had no meaning.

39:09.277 --> 39:12.948
Uh, so...

39:12.982 --> 39:15.951
I'll be letting myself out

39:15.985 --> 39:17.553
before things get
any more uncomfortable.

39:17.585 --> 39:23.091
Um, you know, I apologize
for the whole... mouth thing.

40:42.170 --> 40:43.272
Fuck.

40:49.444 --> 40:51.313
You don't have to stay.

40:54.516 --> 40:56.586
Try and make me leave.

41:43.464 --> 41:45.266
I know you, Jonathan.

41:45.299 --> 41:47.569
I can see right into you.

42:13.362 --> 42:15.298
Leave something inside her.

42:29.478 --> 42:32.081
No, no, Jonathan, don't...

43:42.583 --> 43:44.186
What?

43:47.456 --> 43:48.791
What?

44:17.319 --> 44:20.355
<i>All of it, except five dollars.</i>

44:23.424 --> 44:25.627
<i>But that's all I can spare.</i>

44:25.661 --> 44:28.264
<i>You can't leave me like this!</i>

44:28.297 --> 44:30.166
<i>And I came all this way.</i>

44:34.735 --> 44:37.406
<i>Oh, don't you see, my husband,
he will discover everything.</i>

44:37.438 --> 44:40.842
<i>Well, I have to make
another connection.</i>

44:40.875 --> 44:42.810
<i>If you really want it,
I might accept that ring</i>

44:42.844 --> 44:44.246
<i>for five dollars.</i>

44:44.279 --> 44:45.947
<i>But it was my engagement ring!</i>

45:06.701 --> 45:08.270
<i>Go back.</i>

45:12.373 --> 45:14.377
<i>Let me take you back...</i>

45:17.511 --> 45:18.947
<i>...and show you...</i>

45:23.018 --> 45:24.786
<i>...what you cannot remember...</i>

45:26.922 --> 45:28.757
<i>Mrs. Lynn?</i>

45:28.790 --> 45:31.226
<i>...because you did not see</i>

45:31.259 --> 45:34.229
<i>because you were not there.</i>

45:34.263 --> 45:36.264
<i>Mrs. Lynn?</i>

45:36.297 --> 45:39.234
Would you follow me, please?

45:39.268 --> 45:42.838
<i>I appreciate you
comin' out, Mrs. Lynn.</i>

45:42.871 --> 45:45.741
It's important for us
to straighten this out.

45:45.773 --> 45:48.610
- Emotions run high.
- I just want my daughter back.

45:48.643 --> 45:50.812
I assure you

45:50.846 --> 45:53.782
she's been well taken care of.

45:53.815 --> 45:55.684
Mother was strong.

45:55.717 --> 45:57.586
What it comes down to is this,

45:57.618 --> 46:00.888
the property rights,
the waterfront acreage,

46:00.922 --> 46:02.358
that's gone...

46:02.391 --> 46:04.560
She believed in justice.

46:04.592 --> 46:07.263
...and it's all perfectly legal.

46:07.295 --> 46:10.366
Unfortunate for you, but legal.

46:10.398 --> 46:11.366
You sign a quitclaim

46:11.400 --> 46:13.602
to the property
and the development rights...

46:13.634 --> 46:16.337
She did not know the rules
of law could be changed.

46:16.371 --> 46:19.975
...and we'll put
all of this behind us.

46:20.007 --> 46:21.944
Who's us?

46:21.976 --> 46:23.344
Who's we?

46:25.547 --> 46:28.484
We are the authorities.

46:28.516 --> 46:30.285
We are the law.

46:30.319 --> 46:32.788
Mrs. Lynn,
could you stand, please?

46:32.821 --> 46:34.355
Who are you?

46:34.389 --> 46:37.393
- <i>They threatened her.</i>
- Raise your arms.

46:37.426 --> 46:38.893
Ow, what, no, you can't...

46:38.927 --> 46:40.429
- They bullied her.
- <i>...arrest me.</i>

46:40.462 --> 46:41.397
You gonna sit there?

46:41.429 --> 46:43.065
Get your hands off of me!

46:43.098 --> 46:44.565
- Come on.
- What?

46:44.598 --> 46:45.667
- Stop resisting.
- No.

46:45.701 --> 46:47.036
Take it easy,
put your hands

46:47.069 --> 46:48.570
- behind your back.
- No!

46:48.603 --> 46:50.039
You're not being arrested,

46:50.072 --> 46:52.775
you're just being
detained, now relax!

47:01.382 --> 47:02.717
Mrs. Lynn, just relax.

47:07.522 --> 47:09.857
<i>They violated her rights.</i>

47:12.893 --> 47:13.962
No!

47:20.802 --> 47:24.673
<i>Maybe, if you'd been there,</i>

47:24.706 --> 47:27.676
<i>it might have been different.</i>

47:27.708 --> 47:30.678
<i>You were just a boy then.</i>

47:30.712 --> 47:35.751
<i>And maybe you could
have stopped it,</i>

47:35.784 --> 47:37.420
<i>but we'll never know...</i>

47:40.422 --> 47:41.824
...'cause you were not there.

47:56.170 --> 47:57.739
We should call an ambulance.

47:57.772 --> 48:00.441
Not just yet.

48:00.475 --> 48:02.411
<i>Once they got what they wanted,</i>

48:02.444 --> 48:04.646
<i>they disposed of the evidence.</i>

48:04.679 --> 48:07.616
Her husband is
in county lockup.

48:07.648 --> 48:09.118
I'll have him
sent over to state.

48:09.150 --> 48:12.120
It'll be a lot easier
to deal with him there

48:12.154 --> 48:15.391
once he's lost in the crowd.

48:15.424 --> 48:17.659
And one by one,

48:17.692 --> 48:18.761
<i>they buried us...</i>

48:21.730 --> 48:23.031
<i>...except for one.</i>

48:23.063 --> 48:25.134
There's a son, right?

48:25.167 --> 48:26.435
<i>Except for you...</i>

48:26.467 --> 48:28.170
Military school in Vidalia.

48:28.203 --> 48:31.172
A real fuck up, but just a kid.

48:31.206 --> 48:33.409
<i>...'cause you were not there.</i>

48:54.929 --> 48:56.732
Sorry, Jonathan.

49:03.170 --> 49:05.808
<i>For years, you were alone.</i>

49:05.840 --> 49:07.576
<i>You suffered.</i>

49:07.609 --> 49:10.511
<i>You endured.</i>

49:10.545 --> 49:12.581
<i>You survived.</i>

49:14.482 --> 49:17.185
<i>They offered you the cup</i>

49:17.219 --> 49:19.688
<i>to take away
the pain of living.</i>

49:27.628 --> 49:30.598
American cowboy.

49:30.632 --> 49:34.101
Well, so be it.

49:57.125 --> 50:00.228
Don't worry, Jonathan.

50:00.261 --> 50:01.796
I'll give you strength.

50:10.906 --> 50:14.576
<i>Why didn't you die, Jonathan?</i>

50:14.609 --> 50:16.744
<i>You had so many opportunities.</i>

50:20.081 --> 50:21.884
<i>You had a reason to live.</i>

50:23.918 --> 50:25.253
<i>Purpose.</i>

50:35.263 --> 50:38.766
<i>I promised I would
give you strength,</i>

50:38.799 --> 50:39.801
and I did.

50:41.969 --> 50:44.072
<i>That's why I appeared to you...</i>

50:46.107 --> 50:47.842
<i>...to show you the way.</i>

50:51.045 --> 50:53.314
Vengeance is ours.

50:56.784 --> 50:58.853
<i>An eye for an eye</i>

50:58.886 --> 51:02.590
<i>wasn't enough.</i>

51:02.623 --> 51:06.861
<i>I didn't want an eye...</i>

51:06.895 --> 51:10.032
I wanted the entire head.

51:10.065 --> 51:12.134
<i>All that they are,</i>

51:12.167 --> 51:14.670
<i>all that they
ever hoped to become.</i>

51:16.270 --> 51:19.173
<i>We took our time,</i>

51:19.206 --> 51:23.679
<i>we carefully laid the plans,</i>

51:23.712 --> 51:27.983
<i>until they were ready
for execution.</i>

51:28.016 --> 51:30.252
<i>It will be as if</i>

51:30.284 --> 51:33.955
they never existed,

51:33.989 --> 51:35.824
<i>and all...</i>

51:35.857 --> 51:37.793
<i>will be right...</i>

51:37.826 --> 51:39.161
<i>in the world.</i>

51:45.032 --> 51:48.770
I'm not hurting Margaret.

52:16.096 --> 52:17.832
No, no.

52:17.866 --> 52:20.936
They've seen me.

52:20.969 --> 52:21.970
Who?

54:02.337 --> 54:03.938
- Margaret.
- Yeah?

54:03.971 --> 54:05.073
A visitor.

54:10.244 --> 54:11.947
You need me to stick around?

54:11.980 --> 54:12.914
It's okay.

54:12.947 --> 54:14.215
I'll see you tonight, all right?

54:19.520 --> 54:23.124
Hey, uh, I was hoping
you'd stop by.

54:25.058 --> 54:26.393
Listen, I have something
to talk to you about.

54:26.427 --> 54:30.332
- It's, it's kind of big, so...
- Listen, Margaret,

54:30.364 --> 54:33.400
I can't stay here anymore.

54:33.433 --> 54:35.002
Well, hold on.

54:35.036 --> 54:36.237
We'll talk through it, I just...

54:36.270 --> 54:38.506
- Something's kinda come up.
- There's no more time to talk.

54:38.540 --> 54:39.975
If I don't get out of here now,

54:40.007 --> 54:42.843
- it's gonna be bad.
- Okay, well...

54:46.581 --> 54:49.851
I'm so sorry to interrupt you...

54:49.884 --> 54:51.219
I don't mean to
trouble you at all, ma'am.

54:51.252 --> 54:52.821
I'm just supposed
to pick up a friend here,

54:52.853 --> 54:54.388
and I ain't seen
hair nor hide of her.

54:54.422 --> 54:55.791
- I was wondering if ya...
- Uh, who's that?

54:55.824 --> 54:57.826
Well, it's a girl
about your age,

54:57.859 --> 54:59.226
uh, she's a daughter
of a friend of mine,

54:59.259 --> 55:01.529
Max Lynn, her name's Berenice.

55:03.364 --> 55:04.532
Either one of y'all
ever heard of her?

55:04.565 --> 55:06.333
No, I don't think so.

55:06.366 --> 55:08.502
Yeah, if you knowed her,
you wouldn't forget her,

55:08.536 --> 55:09.337
especially with
a name like that.

55:09.369 --> 55:10.839
You don't hear
that every day, now?

55:10.871 --> 55:12.406
I'm sorry,
why would she be here?

55:12.440 --> 55:13.340
Well, see, that's the thing.

55:13.373 --> 55:14.875
I couldn't put grits to gravy

55:14.909 --> 55:16.211
of that in my mind neither.

55:16.243 --> 55:18.312
But, I don't know,
I figured she'd be at a mall...

55:18.346 --> 55:19.179
Okay, well,
you know you're welcome

55:19.214 --> 55:20.114
to wait in the lobby,
but we're just

55:20.147 --> 55:22.016
- shutting down here.
- Here I am gabbin',

55:22.049 --> 55:23.384
takin' up all y'all's time.

55:23.418 --> 55:25.387
I'll just, I'll just
go on outside and wait,

55:25.420 --> 55:27.088
and smoke a cigarette...
I know they're

55:27.121 --> 55:28.123
supposed to be killers,

55:28.156 --> 55:30.592
but, uh, old habits die hard.

55:30.625 --> 55:31.927
Thank y'all for your kindness,

55:31.960 --> 55:33.228
all right, y'all take care.

55:43.136 --> 55:44.839
I need to go.

55:44.873 --> 55:46.541
Well, I know, but just
wait a second, Jonathan.

55:46.574 --> 55:48.076
- Once I take care of this...
- Jonathan, I should...

55:48.109 --> 55:50.578
Hang on, listen, hey!

55:50.612 --> 55:51.914
Don't come back.

55:54.949 --> 55:58.153
If you leave now,

55:58.185 --> 55:59.321
don't come back.

56:04.558 --> 56:08.128
Margaret,
you don't understand.

56:08.161 --> 56:09.897
Because you never
tell me anything.

56:09.931 --> 56:13.601
You just stand there,
like a statue, all...

56:13.634 --> 56:16.003
You don't know anything
about me.

56:16.036 --> 56:19.975
You don't know that I am trying
to protect you.

56:20.007 --> 56:21.843
Ow, stop, you can't do that!

56:24.177 --> 56:25.880
You can't shake me!

56:28.616 --> 56:30.150
You can't...

56:30.183 --> 56:31.853
you can't shake me.

56:39.127 --> 56:42.464
If you wanna leave...

56:42.496 --> 56:43.632
leave.

57:36.150 --> 57:37.585
You know, you don't need to be

57:37.618 --> 57:40.322
yellin' at your
own girl like that,

57:40.355 --> 57:42.190
especially when you know
how much you mean to her.

57:42.223 --> 57:43.991
Womenfolk, what they like

57:44.025 --> 57:47.429
is to be treated with
a little bit of tenderness.

57:47.462 --> 57:50.632
What do you want?

57:50.665 --> 57:53.201
You shoot straight
to the point, don't ya?

57:53.234 --> 57:56.503
I want you to get in the car.

57:56.536 --> 57:59.674
I want you and me
to go for a little ride,

57:59.706 --> 58:02.344
sort some things out,
how 'bout that?

58:04.444 --> 58:06.347
Why would I go
anywhere with you?

58:09.449 --> 58:11.185
Leather seats?

58:20.060 --> 58:24.398
Well, if you want we can
go settle this inside.

58:24.431 --> 58:25.567
Don't reckon your
girlfriend would like that

58:25.600 --> 58:29.503
that much, though.

58:33.607 --> 58:36.410
Go on, drink the coffee
if you want to.

58:36.444 --> 58:39.080
I got one with cream
and sugar, and one plain.

58:39.112 --> 58:41.181
Figured I'd cover my bases.

58:44.085 --> 58:47.188
We gonna need
all the energy we can get

58:47.221 --> 58:49.023
for what comes next.

59:02.369 --> 59:04.005
That's right.

59:10.610 --> 59:12.580
Hits ya hard, doesn't it?

59:14.614 --> 59:16.417
Close your eyes.

59:18.552 --> 59:21.455
'Fore you know it,
it'll all be over with.

59:22.589 --> 59:24.725
It'll all be over...

1:00:10.404 --> 1:00:11.540
Yeah.

1:00:23.817 --> 1:00:25.185
Jesus.

1:00:47.942 --> 1:00:50.712
They'll kill him.

1:00:50.744 --> 1:00:52.380
If they haven't already.

1:00:57.884 --> 1:01:00.354
Maybe he saw 'em coming.

1:01:00.388 --> 1:01:04.292
Maybe he'll get away.

1:01:26.279 --> 1:01:27.814
<i>The way you described him,
I thought I'd be</i>

1:01:27.848 --> 1:01:30.552
<i>seeing me a pitbull.</i>

1:01:30.585 --> 1:01:33.487
<i>Nothin' but a little ol' mutt.</i>

1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:35.322
<i>A dog is a dog.</i>

1:01:36.757 --> 1:01:37.926
<i>Put him in a bag.</i>

1:01:40.527 --> 1:01:42.596
Throw him in the water.

1:02:41.355 --> 1:02:43.225
Shrimpin's all I used to do...

1:02:46.661 --> 1:02:48.863
...back before the oil
spill killed it off.

1:02:51.565 --> 1:02:54.502
Me and my daddy,

1:02:54.534 --> 1:03:00.607
we'd chase shrimp
up and down the Florida coast.

1:03:00.641 --> 1:03:02.909
Hell of a life.

1:03:09.449 --> 1:03:12.953
After Daddy died, I figured
it'd be easier to just, uh...

1:03:15.422 --> 1:03:20.328
...get a job
working for the state.

1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.397
Sure as hell do miss it, though.

1:03:23.431 --> 1:03:27.467
Couldn't get rid of the boat,
though, you know it?

1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:29.403
She, uh,

1:03:29.436 --> 1:03:33.440
been in the family too long.

1:03:44.585 --> 1:03:46.388
Well, all right then.

1:05:34.561 --> 1:05:36.630
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

1:05:36.663 --> 1:05:38.665
<i>gently down the stream</i>

1:05:38.699 --> 1:05:40.935
<i>Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily</i>

1:05:40.967 --> 1:05:44.638
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

1:05:44.672 --> 1:05:46.706
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

1:05:46.739 --> 1:05:48.810
<i>gently down the stream</i>

1:05:48.842 --> 1:05:50.944
<i>Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily</i>

1:05:50.978 --> 1:05:54.648
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

1:06:01.522 --> 1:06:03.623
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

1:06:03.656 --> 1:06:05.792
<i>gently down the stream</i>

1:06:05.826 --> 1:06:07.962
<i>Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily</i>

1:06:07.994 --> 1:06:10.498
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

1:06:18.505 --> 1:06:20.241
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

1:06:20.273 --> 1:06:22.777
<i>gently down the stream</i>

1:06:22.810 --> 1:06:24.846
<i>Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily</i>

1:06:24.878 --> 1:06:26.915
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

1:06:34.721 --> 1:06:36.590
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

1:06:36.623 --> 1:06:38.859
<i>gently down the stream</i>

1:06:38.893 --> 1:06:40.927
<i>Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily</i>

1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:43.163
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

1:06:51.304 --> 1:06:53.707
<i>Row, row, row your boat...</i>

1:06:59.712 --> 1:07:02.850
<i>...gently down the stream</i>

1:07:06.587 --> 1:07:09.858
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

1:07:53.900 --> 1:07:57.003
<i>Names.</i>

1:07:57.036 --> 1:07:59.172
<i>Why is she asking for names?</i>

1:08:01.241 --> 1:08:04.110
She's doin' it again.

1:08:04.143 --> 1:08:07.881
- I wonder if she's trying...
- Did you check her?

1:08:07.915 --> 1:08:12.686
- Check her, what do we...
- Did you pat her down?

1:08:12.719 --> 1:08:14.922
No.

1:08:14.955 --> 1:08:18.259
So you're gonna let this woman

1:08:18.292 --> 1:08:21.328
walk in here
and bring us down

1:08:21.362 --> 1:08:24.065
because you're too shy

1:08:24.098 --> 1:08:26.167
to pat her down?

1:08:26.200 --> 1:08:29.770
- Pat her down for what?
- A wire, Charles!

1:08:29.803 --> 1:08:31.772
If I know anything about women,

1:08:31.804 --> 1:08:36.276
I know that that one
is wearing a goddamn wire!

1:08:43.950 --> 1:08:45.018
Yeah?

1:09:10.377 --> 1:09:13.313
You might've called.

1:09:13.347 --> 1:09:14.882
Where is he?

1:09:14.914 --> 1:09:16.282
<i>Who?</i>

1:09:16.316 --> 1:09:18.019
<i>You know who.</i>

1:09:19.852 --> 1:09:20.855
He's alive.

1:09:22.856 --> 1:09:26.960
<i>He has been
killin' off the entire town.</i>

1:09:26.994 --> 1:09:30.264
<i>He has a very Old Testament
view of the world.</i>

1:09:32.732 --> 1:09:36.337
<i>If given the chance,
he'd kill us all.</i>

1:09:36.370 --> 1:09:38.906
Not all of us.

1:09:38.938 --> 1:09:42.043
Wait, do you think...

1:09:44.777 --> 1:09:47.114
You naive child.

1:09:47.146 --> 1:09:50.684
You think you mean
something to him?

1:09:50.718 --> 1:09:52.853
You're nothing to him.

1:09:52.886 --> 1:09:57.857
You're... you're not even
a piece of ass.

1:09:57.891 --> 1:10:00.695
You're bait.

1:10:00.727 --> 1:10:02.862
I mean, the only reason that,

1:10:02.896 --> 1:10:06.767
that he is pretending
to be interested in you

1:10:06.799 --> 1:10:11.905
is so that he
can get closer to me.

1:10:11.938 --> 1:10:14.776
If that is the case, Mother...

1:10:18.111 --> 1:10:20.914
...I will be happy
to have helped.

1:10:23.417 --> 1:10:25.285
You see, I know
what he's done...

1:10:28.187 --> 1:10:29.923
...and I know why he did it.

1:10:33.227 --> 1:10:39.133
How deeply you
despise me, Margaret.

1:10:39.165 --> 1:10:44.204
Resentment just flows
through your veins, doesn't it?

1:10:44.237 --> 1:10:47.040
Oh, I can't blame you really.

1:10:47.074 --> 1:10:48.843
It couldn't have been easy

1:10:48.875 --> 1:10:52.213
growin' up
Justice Merrill's daughter.

1:10:52.245 --> 1:10:54.481
If it makes any
difference to you,

1:10:54.514 --> 1:10:58.518
bein' Justice Merrill
was no walk in the park.

1:11:01.355 --> 1:11:04.859
After your father died,

1:11:04.892 --> 1:11:08.395
they descended...

1:11:08.428 --> 1:11:10.064
like locusts.

1:11:13.066 --> 1:11:14.201
Who?

1:11:14.234 --> 1:11:16.803
Oh, bankers, the lawyers,

1:11:16.837 --> 1:11:18.772
his business associates,

1:11:18.806 --> 1:11:22.744
all eager to take advantage.

1:11:24.311 --> 1:11:27.014
I fought them all

1:11:27.047 --> 1:11:29.817
tooth and nail.

1:11:29.850 --> 1:11:31.317
I turned off my feelin's,

1:11:31.351 --> 1:11:36.423
and allowed myself
to become hardened.

1:11:36.455 --> 1:11:38.892
But I was determined...

1:11:41.361 --> 1:11:44.831
...no one would ever

1:11:44.865 --> 1:11:48.236
take advantage of me.

1:11:54.407 --> 1:11:56.209
If I asked you...

1:12:01.347 --> 1:12:04.584
...if I asked you

1:12:04.618 --> 1:12:06.853
to spare Jonathan...

1:12:09.356 --> 1:12:10.291
...would you?

1:13:00.473 --> 1:13:01.441
Hey.

1:13:13.286 --> 1:13:15.556
How you holdin' up?

1:13:15.588 --> 1:13:19.626
Oh, you know.

1:13:19.660 --> 1:13:20.628
Yeah.

1:13:23.297 --> 1:13:26.400
What's it now, four months?

1:13:26.432 --> 1:13:27.868
Five.

1:13:42.982 --> 1:13:45.351
I know you...

1:13:45.384 --> 1:13:47.355
don't know where Jonathan is.

1:13:49.522 --> 1:13:53.159
I know you don't have any
way of contacting him.

1:13:53.192 --> 1:13:54.227
That's right.

1:13:58.632 --> 1:14:03.270
But I'm just starting
to get a little...

1:14:03.303 --> 1:14:04.972
scared, you know?

1:14:10.110 --> 1:14:12.213
If he contacts you, will you...

1:14:14.347 --> 1:14:15.949
...will you tell him I'm...

1:14:18.986 --> 1:14:20.654
...just tell him I need him.

1:15:35.562 --> 1:15:37.698
I almost didn't keep it.

1:15:40.534 --> 1:15:45.406
I didn't mind giving up
part of myself, but you...

1:15:48.441 --> 1:15:50.677
...I couldn't lose
any part of you.

1:15:55.382 --> 1:15:57.250
Margaret, you can't
come with me.

1:16:00.286 --> 1:16:03.456
They know who I am.

1:16:03.490 --> 1:16:07.361
- If anyone saw me with you...
- No, you're wrong. Listen.

1:16:07.393 --> 1:16:11.431
Just promise me
the killing will stop.

1:16:11.464 --> 1:16:15.369
I can make it all go away.

1:16:17.870 --> 1:16:21.074
She can fix this.

1:16:21.107 --> 1:16:22.575
She can help us, she can...

1:16:26.646 --> 1:16:29.516
I need you...

1:16:29.548 --> 1:16:31.618
I need you to trust me.

1:16:40.494 --> 1:16:45.132
You once told me I could
have anything I wanted,

1:16:45.164 --> 1:16:46.633
if only I would ask.

1:16:50.370 --> 1:16:51.639
So I'm asking.

1:16:55.307 --> 1:16:57.477
Are you sure

1:16:57.511 --> 1:16:59.513
this is what you want?

1:17:02.315 --> 1:17:03.750
Never more sure.

1:17:07.187 --> 1:17:09.523
And how badly do you want it?

1:17:12.659 --> 1:17:15.429
Would you, uh,
beg for his life?

1:17:15.462 --> 1:17:16.730
If that's what it takes.

1:17:20.901 --> 1:17:25.606
I beg you, Mother...

1:17:25.638 --> 1:17:27.141
please, if you could...

1:17:27.173 --> 1:17:29.409
Is this your idea of begging?

1:17:49.195 --> 1:17:51.664
For my sake,

1:17:51.697 --> 1:17:53.200
for the sake of my baby,

1:17:53.232 --> 1:17:55.369
- please...
- Stop it.

1:18:06.980 --> 1:18:08.915
Continue.

1:18:12.718 --> 1:18:16.355
If you've ever wanted to do
anything for me...

1:18:16.388 --> 1:18:19.192
What you don't seem to realize

1:18:19.226 --> 1:18:20.694
is that Margaret
is the only thing

1:18:20.727 --> 1:18:23.530
keeping you alive right now.

1:18:23.562 --> 1:18:26.499
Is that a fact?

1:18:26.532 --> 1:18:27.633
Because you see,

1:18:27.667 --> 1:18:29.369
from where I'm sittin',

1:18:29.401 --> 1:18:30.971
she seems to be pleadin'

1:18:31.004 --> 1:18:34.275
for your life, not mine.

1:18:39.312 --> 1:18:41.281
It's funny, but uh,

1:18:41.313 --> 1:18:44.985
you don't strike me as a killer,

1:18:45.017 --> 1:18:49.922
just don't seem capable.

1:18:49.955 --> 1:18:53.493
Give me a taste
of your murderous side,

1:18:53.526 --> 1:18:55.329
just a glimpse,

1:18:55.361 --> 1:19:00.667
so I'll know you are
who you say you are.

1:19:00.700 --> 1:19:01.935
No more killing.

1:19:01.968 --> 1:19:05.206
Oh, well, how convenient.

1:19:07.473 --> 1:19:10.543
Show me some teeth,
or get on your knees.

1:19:10.576 --> 1:19:11.911
What more do you want
from me, I've already...

1:19:11.945 --> 1:19:14.781
Shut up!

1:19:14.813 --> 1:19:17.517
Shut your mouth!

1:19:17.549 --> 1:19:19.619
Ugly.

1:19:27.694 --> 1:19:31.431
Are you a killer...

1:19:31.463 --> 1:19:33.332
or a coward?

1:19:33.365 --> 1:19:34.334
Hm?

1:19:42.709 --> 1:19:44.711
Let's go.

1:19:44.744 --> 1:19:45.646
Bye, Mother.

1:19:45.678 --> 1:19:47.813
You take one more step,

1:19:47.847 --> 1:19:49.750
and I swear to baby Jesus

1:19:49.782 --> 1:19:53.286
I will put a bullet
through the both of you.

1:19:58.557 --> 1:19:59.859
Leave.

1:20:06.098 --> 1:20:08.835
Oh, well, that's better.

1:20:12.638 --> 1:20:15.476
I know you're in there.

1:20:18.911 --> 1:20:20.647
Show yourself.

1:20:22.414 --> 1:20:24.017
Come on, now.

1:20:25.951 --> 1:20:29.056
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1:20:31.458 --> 1:20:34.828
And just so you know,

1:20:34.861 --> 1:20:37.698
I loved you.

1:20:37.731 --> 1:20:39.965
Come on, now.

1:20:49.508 --> 1:20:52.111
I said...

1:20:52.145 --> 1:20:55.949
turn around and face me!

1:20:55.981 --> 1:20:57.051
No.

1:21:03.956 --> 1:21:07.861
If you wanna kill him...

1:21:07.893 --> 1:21:10.063
you'll have to kill me first.

1:22:26.873 --> 1:22:29.176
No, no, no!

1:23:03.176 --> 1:23:07.112
What'd you expect?

1:23:07.146 --> 1:23:09.550
How else could this have ended?

1:23:49.155 --> 1:23:52.092

1:24:46.980 --> 1:24:50.683
This business of
fighting and dying...

1:24:56.356 --> 1:24:59.759
...I wish there
was a better way,

1:24:59.792 --> 1:25:02.596
but it seems the only way

1:25:02.629 --> 1:25:06.633
to accomplish
anything in this world

1:25:06.665 --> 1:25:09.636
is to kill or to die.

1:25:11.637 --> 1:25:14.373
Americans don't understand that,

1:25:14.406 --> 1:25:16.810
the power of dying.

1:25:16.843 --> 1:25:20.714
All they care about
is staying alive.

1:25:20.746 --> 1:25:24.918
And that, ironically,

1:25:24.950 --> 1:25:27.020
will be the death of them.

1:25:29.388 --> 1:25:33.025
Here, drink this.

1:25:33.058 --> 1:25:35.195
It will calm you.

1:25:37.062 --> 1:25:40.232
It will allow for things
to go easy for you.

1:25:43.136 --> 1:25:44.971
And you?

1:25:45.004 --> 1:25:48.008
Would you martyr yourself?

1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:51.078
Is there anything in your
life worth dying for?

1:25:52.945 --> 1:25:54.347
Hm?

1:26:18.937 --> 1:26:20.272
No!

1:27:14.093 --> 1:27:16.362
<i>And every night,
I get down on my knees,</i>

1:27:16.395 --> 1:27:20.834
<i>and I pray for the judgment
and the strength</i>

1:27:20.866 --> 1:27:23.902
<i>to continue to defend
the way of life</i>

1:27:23.936 --> 1:27:29.209
<i>that we have all
struggled so hard to attain.</i>

1:27:29.241 --> 1:27:31.844
<i>God bless New Canaan.</i>

1:27:31.878 --> 1:27:35.815
<i>God bless the state of Alabama!</i>

1:27:35.847 --> 1:27:39.451
And God bless America!
