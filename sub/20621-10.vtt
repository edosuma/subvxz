WEBVTT

00:06.590 --> 00:08.175
My name is Chef Jeff.

00:08.259 --> 00:09.802
And I'm Dev Shah.

00:09.885 --> 00:12.388
We're good friends
that love to travel...

00:12.471 --> 00:13.639
And to eat.

00:13.723 --> 00:17.435
This is BFFs.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.353
When it's cold
in New York City,

00:19.437 --> 00:21.439
that means it's is BFFs season.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.898
Today, I'm gonna take Dev

00:22.982 --> 00:25.443
to Okonomi in Williiamsburg.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.988
Chef Katoman doles out some of
my top noodles in this town.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.698
Dev, are you hungry?

00:30.781 --> 00:32.074
Uh, yes, I am.

00:32.158 --> 00:33.909
My man. Let's eat.

00:35.161 --> 00:38.539
Wow. Okay, now this is
called "Mazemen ramen."

00:38.622 --> 00:39.999
"Maze" means "to mix."

00:40.082 --> 00:41.083
- Right?
- All right.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.418
And the thing about this ramen

00:42.501 --> 00:44.253
is that it is
completely broth-less.

00:44.336 --> 00:45.796
So you really have to
take the chopsticks.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.590
- And really mix it up.
- I'm mixing.

00:47.673 --> 00:48.716
See how moist it gets?

00:48.799 --> 00:51.761
Twirling, Jeff, I think I got a
dangerously good bite coming up here.

00:51.844 --> 00:53.512
- Do you see this right here?
- Mmm, mmm.

00:53.596 --> 00:54.805
- I'm about to eat this.
- Eat it.

00:56.182 --> 00:57.850
Mmm!

00:57.933 --> 00:59.769
- Holy!
- Yeah.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.729
- See?
- That tasted so good.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.731
We're gonna
set a record on BFFs:

01:03.814 --> 01:05.107
most curses on Food TV.

01:05.191 --> 01:06.358
This is crazy, this is bacon?

01:06.442 --> 01:07.902
- Oh, my God. Mmm!
- Mmm.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.779
- You know what I say?
- I say broth.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.572
- Oh, come on.
- I just want this.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.450
Come on, our bleep guy's getting
carpal tunnel syndrome back there.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.494
God, Katoman, this is amazing.
Thank you

01:16.577 --> 01:17.787
Arigato.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.622
Ah, so you speak a
little English?

01:19.705 --> 01:22.458
- A little.
- What's your favorite English word?

01:22.541 --> 01:23.751
Been

01:26.796 --> 01:28.798
- You want to get that makeup off?
- Thank you, Harold.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.841
- Can I grab a wipe?
- Yeah.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.093
Hey, what happened to Lisa?

01:32.176 --> 01:33.052
She took another job.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.845
She's over on Stage 3
if you want to say hi.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.597
Oh, you know why she left?
Everything okay?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.349
I don't know. She
didn't tell me.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.850
I forgot you just
started, Harold.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.644
My name's Graham.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.979
I've been working here
almost the entire season.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.940
- Ohh.
- Yeah.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.650
You know, it's-- it's
the G and the H.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.151
- Graham, Harold.
- Harold.

01:49.235 --> 01:50.152
- It's close.
- Yeah.

01:50.236 --> 01:51.153
In the alphabet.

01:51.237 --> 01:52.321
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.322
All right, well,

01:53.405 --> 01:55.116
thanks for the wipe, Graham.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.909
Graham.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.247
Hi.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.748
Let me guess.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.167
You broke up with Pino.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.334
Everything's okay.

02:47.418 --> 02:51.463
And we can continue having a
joyous time in New York together

02:51.547 --> 02:52.506
Dev.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.844
I shouldn't even be here.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.929
I'm sorry.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.018
How are you feeling?

03:09.732 --> 03:10.941
I feel shit.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.903
I feel horrible.

03:15.154 --> 03:18.365
I feel I'm doing something
terrible behind his back.

03:20.159 --> 03:23.871
He's a nice person. He
doesn't deserve this.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.252
You know how bad it is just

03:30.336 --> 03:32.922
to spend time with you,

03:33.005 --> 03:35.132
enjoy the moment, and then

03:35.216 --> 03:36.675
go back home, lie in bed

03:36.759 --> 03:39.220
with your actual fiancé?

03:44.225 --> 03:46.393
You know, sometimes--

03:46.477 --> 03:49.688
I mean, I know it-- it's gonna
sound real weird, but--

03:49.772 --> 03:53.692
sometimes, I wish he
was cheating on me.

03:54.610 --> 03:57.071
It would be so much
easier to just break up.

03:58.489 --> 03:59.907
Maybe he is cheating on you,

03:59.990 --> 04:01.492
he's just really
good at hiding it.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.077
Let's just assume
he's cheating on you.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.579
Maybe he's sleeping with some
woman named Tanya right now.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.164
Stop it.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.833
This is bad. It's not a game.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.420
It's not that easy.

04:19.134 --> 04:22.054
I wish we could have met each
other when we were both single.

04:24.974 --> 04:27.226
'Cause you think that I
would immediately say,

04:27.309 --> 04:28.394
"Oh, my God, Dev.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.937
Finally, I met you."

04:30.062 --> 04:31.522
You don't think if
we met each other

04:31.605 --> 04:33.357
at a bar or something
that we'd hit it off?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.025
I don't know.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.986
Maybe not? Maybe yes?

04:37.069 --> 04:38.153
Who knows?

04:40.114 --> 04:41.156
I think we would.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.806
Francesca.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.283
Mm-hmm.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.117
But I choose it.

05:36.045 --> 05:37.755
I know.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.383
You're supposed to

You know he has a

near those dice?

09:28.485 --> 09:31.196
What'd you think he was gonna do?
Play Monopoly?

09:31.280 --> 09:33.574
I was just giving
him a little taste, all right?

09:33.657 --> 09:35.075
To get him through the night.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.452
How was I supposed to know he
was gonna get in some dirty cab

09:37.536 --> 09:39.204
and never come back?

09:39.288 --> 09:41.290
But you know how the story goes.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.085
He has a problem, Tommy!

09:45.168 --> 09:47.462
What's it gonna take
for you to say no

09:47.546 --> 09:48.755
to your baby brother?

09:48.839 --> 09:51.216
I got problems too, right?

09:51.300 --> 09:53.343
I got a lot of problems, Zeke!

09:54.511 --> 09:56.221
Baby brother this.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.098
Baby brother that.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.474
That's all I get.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.853
Well, I used to be a baby
brother once too, remember?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.272
Until I saw Richie
fall off the roof

10:05.355 --> 10:07.190
of that construction site.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.985
And I gotta see that again!
And again!

10:10.068 --> 10:12.529
And again! And again!

10:12.613 --> 10:14.615
And again! And again!

10:14.698 --> 10:17.075
Every night before I got to bed!

10:18.493 --> 10:20.746
So you keep telling
me, "Hey, man,

10:20.829 --> 10:22.831
go save someone."

10:22.914 --> 10:24.666
Well, how about somebody come

10:24.750 --> 10:26.043
and save me?

10:28.295 --> 10:31.465
How 'bout just once...

10:31.548 --> 10:35.218
somebody come and save me?

10:36.845 --> 10:38.805
So sleep tight, asshole...

10:41.224 --> 10:43.435
'cause the Hammond Estates...

10:45.228 --> 10:46.521
are closed.

11:01.119 --> 11:01.995
Wow.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.122
Two-man show. Three hours.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.540
- Yeah.
- No intermission.

11:05.624 --> 11:06.708
It's an intense play.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.543
Yeah, it's really intense. Yeah.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.003
How do you remember
all that dialogue?

11:10.087 --> 11:12.089
Oh, man, sometimes I
forget big chunks.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.674
Like, even tonight,

11:13.757 --> 11:15.050
that whole riff on PF Chang's,

11:15.133 --> 11:16.301
I-- I made that up.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.095
Yeah, it seemed a
little off-story.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.055
- I think it worked.
- Hmm.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.890
- You like the theater?
- Yeah, I love it.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.850
It's a great schedule.
Eight shows a week.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.936
But I got my days
free, so I've been

11:26.019 --> 11:28.605
doing a lot of puzzles and,
uh, watching a lot of TV.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.525
Mm. Catch any Clash
of the Cupcakes?

11:31.608 --> 11:33.318
No. Why would I watch
a show like that?

11:33.402 --> 11:34.611
That sounds terrible.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.862
Uh, I used to host it.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.781
Oh. Did they cancel it

11:37.864 --> 11:39.408
because you were bad at hosting?

11:39.491 --> 11:40.909
No. I got a better gig.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.244
That guy Lil' Romeo hosts now.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.245
Oh, I know Romeo.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.663
I played his driving instructor

11:44.746 --> 11:46.707
in, uh, Life in the Fresh Lane.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.083
Wow, I missed that one.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.293
Oh, it was about a kid
from the inner city

11:50.377 --> 11:52.879
who moved to the country
to learn how to drive.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.172
It was fun, man.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.674
I made up a lot
of stuff on that.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.259
So what are you working on now?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.094
I'm actually doing a new show
with that guy Chef Jeff,

11:59.177 --> 12:00.137
it's called BFFs.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.889
It's a travel show, and we just
travel around the world, eating food.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.057
- It's great.
- Mm-hmm.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.268
- Chef Jeff?
- Yeah-yeah, you know that guy?

12:06.351 --> 12:08.353
Yeah, I heard of him. Uh.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.855
I'd be careful with that guy.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.690
Why do you say that?

12:11.773 --> 12:12.941
Whatever. You're
working with him.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.693
It's none of my business.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.278
Don't say shit like
that and not tell me.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.863
What's going on?
What's the deal?

12:17.946 --> 12:19.072
I've heard through the grapevine

12:19.156 --> 12:21.992
that Chef Jeff is a
little bit of a creep.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.118
- What?
- Yeah.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.369
My wife's friend

12:24.453 --> 12:26.037
was food stylist on, like,

12:26.121 --> 12:28.665
Jeff's Backyard
Barbeque or some show,

12:28.749 --> 12:30.751
and she said he hit on her

12:30.834 --> 12:32.669
and, like, every other
woman on the crew.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.713
And at one point, he
crossed the line.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.214
What happened?

12:36.298 --> 12:38.550
Well, they were, like, shooting
late one night, right?

12:38.633 --> 12:42.345
And he offered her a ride home.
And she accepted.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.723
And the minute she got in the
car, he made a move on her.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.768
And she was like, "Hey,
Chef Jeff, I'm married."

12:47.851 --> 12:49.186
And he was like,

12:49.269 --> 12:51.813
"You want to go home and bang
that loser husband of yours?

12:51.897 --> 12:54.024
Or do you want to spend
a legendary night

12:54.107 --> 12:55.692
at Casa de Jeff?"

12:55.776 --> 12:57.819
- Are you serious?
- Totally.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.446
And you know the
thing about it is?

12:59.529 --> 13:01.948
Her husband? Not a loser at all.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.992
His name is Matteo.
He's a pilot.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.413
What am I gonna do? I
gotta work with this guy.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.957
I don't know, man.
That's a tough problem.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.293
I'm glad I don't have
to deal with it.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.086
All right, man.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.421
You got these, right?

13:16.505 --> 13:18.465
Um, yeah.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.551
Hey, Lisa.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.762
Hey, Dev. What are
you doing here?

13:23.845 --> 13:24.846
What's up?

13:24.930 --> 13:26.014
We were just shooting nearby.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.349
I thought I'd come say hello.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.267
- Cool. How are you?
- I'm good.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.560
My skin's lost its mocha glow.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.646
I'm sorry, man.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.189
I'm sure Graham will
hold it down for you.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.315
Graham sucks!

13:35.398 --> 13:36.525
Well, he's not as good as me,

13:36.608 --> 13:37.901
but he is a very nice guy.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.778
Hey, there's a doughnut
truck out front.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.029
- You want to go grab?
- Yeah, sure.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.030
Cool.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.240
So how's the new gig?

13:43.323 --> 13:44.241
Yeah, it's good.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.283
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.535
We miss you over on BFFs.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.536
I miss you too.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.537
Aww.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.164
Is there a reason you
quit all of a sudden?

13:51.248 --> 13:53.333
No, I just felt like
I needed a change.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.543
Yeah.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.336
- Hey, between us...
- Mm?

13:56.419 --> 13:58.171
Did some shit go down?

13:58.255 --> 13:59.756
Uh, I don't know, did you

13:59.840 --> 14:01.675
hear about some shit going down?

14:01.758 --> 14:02.717
I mean, was there

14:02.801 --> 14:05.470
someone maybe being
a little weird...

14:05.554 --> 14:07.097
Yeah.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.099
Jeff was being a
little weird with me.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.851
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

14:10.934 --> 14:11.852
What happened?

14:11.935 --> 14:13.979
Well, he started off
just making remarks

14:14.062 --> 14:15.480
about how I looked.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.899
And then it just got a
little out of hand.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.234
He started getting flirty,

14:19.317 --> 14:20.986
asking me out for drinks.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.195
At a certain point, I was like,

14:22.279 --> 14:24.573
"Jeff, don't talk
to me like that."

14:24.656 --> 14:26.074
And he was like, "Ooh-whee.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.492
She's a feisty one."

14:27.576 --> 14:28.743
I almost punched
him in his face.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.078
Oof.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.663
So then he cooled off a bit.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.373
But then we're on the road,

14:33.456 --> 14:36.459
and he'd do weird shit
like slip me his room key.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.627
Then one night he's, like,

14:37.711 --> 14:39.963
banging on my hotel room
door for, like, ten minutes.

14:40.046 --> 14:40.964
Oh, God.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.215
Yeah, I just--

14:42.299 --> 14:43.425
I didn't feel safe

14:43.508 --> 14:44.551
working with him anymore.

14:44.634 --> 14:45.927
Did you tell anybody?

14:46.011 --> 14:47.220
Yeah, after the hotel thing,

14:47.304 --> 14:48.388
I went and told Paula.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.390
And she was like,
"I talked to him.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.808
It won't happen again."

14:51.892 --> 14:53.226
And then like a week later,

14:53.310 --> 14:56.605
he started saying stuff
about my ass again.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.690
When I went back to
her, she was like,

14:58.773 --> 15:00.150
"I don't know what
else I can do.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.902
He's a flirty touchy-feely guy.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.778
That's just the way he is."

15:05.447 --> 15:07.115
Would it help if we talked
to someone above Paula?

15:07.198 --> 15:08.491
No.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.368
No, it's fine, look,

15:10.452 --> 15:11.786
I don't want to make a
huge deal about it.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.039
I'd rather just
move onto this gig

15:14.122 --> 15:15.415
and forget about it.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.375
Which sucks because
he's probably

15:17.459 --> 15:19.169
doing fucked-up shit
to other people too.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.339
But, what am I gonna
do, sue Food TV?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.008
Have it take over
my entire life?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.052
No, I'd rather just
keep it moving.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.929
Jeez.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.847
Um...

15:30.931 --> 15:33.141
Feels kind of weird to
go get doughnuts now.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.227
I am game if you're game.

15:36.311 --> 15:37.228
Sure.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.355

We have a great

16:04.339 --> 16:07.133
My favorite chef
is gettin' live.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.761
That's right, Chef Jeff
is in the building!

16:11.179 --> 16:12.847
And, we have...

16:12.931 --> 16:15.183
Why are you sitting here
looking all depressed and sad?

16:15.266 --> 16:16.768
This is Raven Live!

16:16.851 --> 16:18.561

Sorry, I'll try
to get perked up.

16:20.897 --> 16:21.856
Damn.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.441
It's a good thing
Raven ain't see you.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.276
'Cause I'm trying
to sign her ass.

Oh, Lord.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.325
Have you been on the Internet?

16:32.409 --> 16:34.494
Since we started talking? No.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.455
I just got a flurry
of fucking emails.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.041
Your buddy Chef Jeff
is a fucking pervert.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.001
What?

16:41.084 --> 16:42.377
Apparently he's been
harassing women for years

16:42.460 --> 16:46.548
and now "Chef Jeff is a perv"
is trending on Twitter!

16:46.631 --> 16:47.841
Oh, my God.

16:47.924 --> 16:51.219
Some lady that did makeup came
forward with this blog post

16:51.302 --> 16:53.346
and then motherfuckin'
flood gates opened up.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.932
People telling all sorts
of crazy-ass stories.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.434
This fool is nasty.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.186
Shannon, what are we gonna do? I'm about
to go on Raven Live! with this guy.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.563
I don't know.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.898
Does he know what's going down?

17:03.982 --> 17:05.650
Come on! Come on!

17:05.734 --> 17:07.444
Come on, motherfucker.
Come on, come on.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.445
Come on, huh?

17:08.528 --> 17:09.863
Uhh.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.781
He looks pretty damn
jolly right now.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.034
This motherfucker.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.327
I knew he was a perv.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.121
Shannon, I'm about to
go on TV with this guy.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.498
- What do we do?
- All right, all right, listen.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.125
You are going to calm down.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.501
You're gonna put on
a big ole smile.

17:23.585 --> 17:27.464
And you're gonna get on Raven Live!
and get this money, you hear me?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.799
I'ma try to get ahead of this.
I got you.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.301
But you ain't a
perv too, are you?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.510
No!

17:33.136 --> 17:34.804
Don't fuck with me.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.100
What are you doing?

17:39.184 --> 17:42.979
I'm trying to search
your soul for the truth.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.691
How long does this
process take'?

17:46.775 --> 17:48.234
Shh.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.028
I'm still looking.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.656
All right.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.617
You on the level.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.951
But I'm watching you.

18:00.789 --> 18:01.748
Hey-hey-hey!

18:01.831 --> 18:03.083
What up, compadre?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.417
You ready, huh? Psyched?

18:04.501 --> 18:06.169
I'm pumped, bro. Huh?

18:06.252 --> 18:08.421
Let's go make this paella.

18:08.505 --> 18:09.422
Hey.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.886
All right,
we're gonna add a little broth.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.847
And let that simmer
for a nice, hot 20.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.849
- That smells amazing.
- Thank you.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.184
- Thank you.
- Wow.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.229
Okay, let's talk about it.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.855
- I'm really excited about this.
- Yeah.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.274
The new show, Best Food Friends,

18:28.358 --> 18:30.318
but it's BFFs.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.736
- That's right.
- I love it!

18:31.820 --> 18:32.862
BFFs, that's right, thank you.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.197
It's a whirlwind tour of, uh,

18:34.280 --> 18:35.490
great food, great culture,

18:35.573 --> 18:36.533
all around the world,

18:36.616 --> 18:37.534
starring, uh, me,

18:37.617 --> 18:39.619
and my man Dev Shah right here.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.080
Oh, I like it, so you guys are,
like, really best friends?

18:42.163 --> 18:43.790
- Absolutely.
- I don't know.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.750
That's just kind of the
title of the show.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.210
My best friend's a
guy named Arnold.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.504
We're just-- that's--
we're just co-workers.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.672
Yeah.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.966
This guy's a real ball-buster,
let me tell you something.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.261
I love it. And this is the ad
I've been seeing all over town.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.972
I mean, you guys are
all on Times Square.

18:59.055 --> 18:59.973
- Oh, God.
- There is is.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.726
Let me tell you,

19:03.810 --> 19:04.686
there is truth in advertising.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.688
Okay, we do do everything
together, it's true.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.690
I don't know. We don't
do everything together.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.899
I mean, you know,

19:09.983 --> 19:11.568
after we're done shooting,

19:11.651 --> 19:13.319
he goes and does his thing,

19:13.403 --> 19:15.780
I go and do mine. I don't
know what he's up to.

19:15.864 --> 19:16.906
You know, I really don't.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.409
I mean, there's a-- a
professional relationship

19:19.492 --> 19:20.910
and a personal relationship.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.078
And there is a line.

19:23.538 --> 19:24.873
Oh, okay.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.374
BFFS!

19:27.625 --> 19:29.669
- Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!
- BFFs.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.007

if I didn't bring
up right now, Jeff.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.042
I don't know if you--
if you know this,

20:09.125 --> 20:10.084
but as of now on the Internet,

20:10.168 --> 20:12.462
there is about 14 females

20:12.545 --> 20:15.340
accusing you of sexually
inappropriate conduct.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.550
What?

20:17.634 --> 20:19.928
Oh, yes, Jeff, there are
detailed accounts being posted

20:20.011 --> 20:21.512
right now of you

20:21.596 --> 20:23.723
having sexually
inappropriate behavior

20:23.806 --> 20:25.767
with fellow staff members

20:25.850 --> 20:27.936
and guests of your show.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.771
Would you like to respond
to these allegations?

20:29.854 --> 20:31.189
I don't know what's
going on right now.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.941
Okay, I mean, I came out here to

20:33.024 --> 20:34.984
share some delicious paella with
you and your beautiful audience.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.237
This is real issues that I'm gonna
be talking about right now.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.030
Did you think I was gonna
run from this, Jeff'?

20:39.113 --> 20:40.365
Did you think I was gonna run?
No.

20:40.448 --> 20:41.616
I--

20:41.699 --> 20:43.451
We don't run here at Raven Live!

20:43.534 --> 20:45.036
- All right, all--
- No.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.579
We talk about the issues here!

20:46.663 --> 20:47.705
- Okay.
- Get him, Raven!

20:47.789 --> 20:50.750
Yeah, well, I think you have two paths
to go down here right now, Raven.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.628
I mean, one path will lead you
to some delicious paella,

20:53.711 --> 20:57.590
juicy lobster, from the
island of Formentera, right?

20:57.674 --> 20:59.467
- Listen, I'm just giving--
- You know what?

20:59.550 --> 21:02.053
- I'm giving you a time to respond, Jeff.
- No paella for anybody.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.513
Do you see what's happening?

21:03.596 --> 21:05.139
Sorry. Goodbye muchachos.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.142
Jeff!

21:10.687 --> 21:13.731
Dev, Dev, would you like
to comment on this?

21:13.815 --> 21:15.483
Uh, Raven, I just
want to be clear,

21:15.566 --> 21:17.944
I-- I'm learning about
this with everyone else.

21:18.027 --> 21:22.073
Um, and if Jeff did
anything inappropriate,

21:22.156 --> 21:25.451
I 100% condone that behavior.

21:25.535 --> 21:26.452
What?

21:26.536 --> 21:27.704
You condone the behavior?

21:27.787 --> 21:28.788
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.165
I misspoke. I misspoke! Okay?

21:31.249 --> 21:33.751
Condone means approve. I'm
sorry, I'm a little nervous.

21:33.835 --> 21:36.129
I'm saying I don't condone
the behavior, okay?

21:36.212 --> 21:37.422
I don't know
anything about this.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.382
Look, I respect
women, all right?

21:39.465 --> 21:41.592
I don't know what's going on.
I'm not his best friend.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.553
Uh, that's not what it
says on the poster.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.221
It specifically says,

21:45.305 --> 21:47.140
you two do everything together.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.018
Come on, Raven. That's just
the premise of the show.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.103
I mean, I don't think you
can see into the future.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.565
I know you did not just
bring up That's So Raven.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.899
I didn't mean any offense.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.151
I'm just gonna leave.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.862
Yeah, you better leave.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.697
Get this clown out
of here, Raven.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.409
Wow. Everyone, Chef
Jeff and his--

22:06.492 --> 22:08.786
his little BFF, Dev Shah.

22:08.870 --> 22:11.539
I can't really condone
watching their show

22:11.622 --> 22:12.957
at this point.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.419
That's okay, we'll be right
back with a live performance

22:16.502 --> 22:18.796
from Dierks Bentley.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.256
♪ This here
is Raven Live! ♪

22:20.340 --> 22:22.759
♪ Yes, it is Raven Live! ♪

22:22.842 --> 22:24.260
♪ Get on your feet ♪

22:24.344 --> 22:25.303
I'm serious.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.512
She's putting every-- hey.

22:26.596 --> 22:27.889
Can you fucking
believe this, man?

22:27.972 --> 22:30.224
I-- I-- I mean, it's fucked.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.185
I'm setting up a conference
call with my PR team.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.354
Set up some talking points for you.
This'll blow over.

22:34.437 --> 22:37.273
Talking points for me? I don't
want to be involved with this.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.567
What do you mean you don't
want to be involved?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.277
I just got grilled by Raven

22:41.361 --> 22:42.820
for something I had
nothing to do with.

22:42.904 --> 22:46.032
Okay, but you don't really
think I did this, do you?

22:46.115 --> 22:47.158
Dev?

22:48.451 --> 22:50.870
Hey, people on our crew
have come up to me

22:50.953 --> 22:52.705
and said you've been
inappropriate with them.

22:52.789 --> 22:53.831
What people?

22:53.915 --> 22:54.832
Women?

22:54.916 --> 22:56.417
Yes.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.086
You're telling me none
of this happened?

22:58.169 --> 22:59.379
None of this happened.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.381
I don't know, man. That's
hard for me to buy.

23:01.464 --> 23:02.715
Why would these
people make it up?

23:02.799 --> 23:03.716
What do you mean, why?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.760
What are you, naive? Fuckin'--

23:05.843 --> 23:07.220
They want to get
their 15 minutes.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.638
Okay, they want money.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.431
They want to bring
Chef Jeff down!

23:10.515 --> 23:12.225
Come on! Get the fuck
out of here, man.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.227
I can't even-- Get the
fuck out of here!

23:14.310 --> 23:15.812
All right.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.235
Fuck.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.947
So what's gonna happen
now with the show

23:29.158 --> 23:30.493
Probably canceled.

23:33.538 --> 23:34.914
I'm so sorry.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.963
What?

23:43.214 --> 23:45.508
I don't care about the show.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.931
I'm happy when you're here.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.814
Have you thought
about everything?

24:03.192 --> 24:05.194
Yeah, I did.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.909
It's just, um...

24:16.456 --> 24:17.832
It's just not easy.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.629
Um...

24:25.590 --> 24:27.049
It's--

24:27.133 --> 24:28.926
I don't even know how

24:29.010 --> 24:32.889
to start this kind of
conversation, um...

24:38.019 --> 24:41.355
I have so many
things in my head.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.941
I'm still trying to
figure out what--

24:44.025 --> 24:46.861
what I think, what
I want, and...

24:49.238 --> 24:51.449
Like,

24:51.532 --> 24:55.119
a month ago I knew
everything about me

24:55.203 --> 24:59.999
and I knew that I was
going to marry Pino

25:00.082 --> 25:02.084
and we would have kids

25:02.168 --> 25:06.506
and we would probably

25:06.589 --> 25:08.382
made a happy family over--

25:08.466 --> 25:09.884
other there in Italy, in Modena.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.969
And then I came here and--

25:12.053 --> 25:14.096
and everything changed.

25:19.685 --> 25:23.064
I just don't know
what I want anymore.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.113
I don't

25:31.197 --> 25:33.407
want to hurt you
because I really,

25:33.491 --> 25:36.536
really care about you.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.621
Stop.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.253
Don't even bother.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.382
Don't say it.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.478
I just feel used.

26:03.688 --> 26:05.356
I did not use you.

26:05.439 --> 26:07.525
That's what it feels like.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.403
Well, but I did not.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.950
Dev, I felt every single
moment that I spent with you.

26:16.033 --> 26:18.995
I was there too.

26:27.753 --> 26:31.882
You're in a rough patch
in your relationship.

26:31.966 --> 26:34.594
You have your fun with
me, and you're done,

26:34.677 --> 26:37.096
and you just toss me aside.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.599
Okay, great, so if this
is what you think,

26:39.682 --> 26:41.851
I just can-- just have
to leave because--

26:41.934 --> 26:42.893
Am I wrong?

26:42.977 --> 26:45.563
Yes, you are wrong, obviously.

26:45.646 --> 26:46.856
- How?
- You are completely wrong.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.232
How am I wrong?

26:48.316 --> 26:50.318
Because it's not simple
like that, and--

26:50.401 --> 26:51.694
- It is. It is.
- No, it's not.

26:51.777 --> 26:52.778
You had your fun with me,

26:52.862 --> 26:53.779
and now you're like,

26:53.863 --> 26:55.239
"Oh, Well, Dev,

26:55.323 --> 26:57.575
we're just friends, so, see ya."

26:57.658 --> 26:59.243
Don't do this to me.

26:59.327 --> 27:00.745
Don't.

27:00.828 --> 27:03.539
Please, try to understand.
Try to understand.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.750
Try to listen.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.501
What do I not understand?

27:07.585 --> 27:09.587
Explain it to me.

27:09.670 --> 27:13.174
Do you want me to explain
to you that it's not easy

27:13.257 --> 27:15.551
to pack your life

27:15.635 --> 27:17.303
and just throw it away?

27:20.181 --> 27:22.892
Do you think it's easy?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.477
I don't know.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.020
What about Mario?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.521
What about Modena? What
about the pasta shop?

27:27.605 --> 27:28.773
What about my grandmother?

27:28.856 --> 27:30.650
What I'm going to say to them?

27:30.733 --> 27:32.610
I'm just gonna move
with Dev in New York

27:32.693 --> 27:35.488
because I had a
really fun month?

27:36.197 --> 27:38.282
So what was that fun month?
Just a fun month?

27:38.366 --> 27:39.825
Just a fun little
emotional fling

27:39.909 --> 27:41.160
to take your mind off

27:41.243 --> 27:43.996
a-- a relationship that's dying?

27:44.080 --> 27:46.290
Maybe.

27:46.374 --> 27:48.459
Is that really fair to me?

27:52.046 --> 27:53.589
Is it?

27:56.258 --> 27:58.928
I will probably go now.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.347
I feel so uncomfortable
right now.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.015
Don't go. Hey.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.353
Dev, really.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.188
Let me go.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.749
Hey, Dev.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.085
Hi.

29:14.545 --> 29:15.463
Hey, Rachel.

29:15.546 --> 29:17.673
What's up?

29:17.757 --> 29:19.008
Um...

29:19.091 --> 29:21.427
How are you? How is everything?

29:21.510 --> 29:24.221
Um, things are good.

29:24.305 --> 29:26.056
They're, uh, really good.

29:26.140 --> 29:28.267
How are, uh, how are
things with you?

29:28.350 --> 29:30.853
They're good.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.105
Uh, well, congratulations
on your show.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.316
I've-- I've seen the
posters around everywhere.

29:35.399 --> 29:37.109
Yeah, it's crazy.

29:37.193 --> 29:39.737
Hey, Rach, we should
probably get going.

29:39.820 --> 29:40.738
Yeah.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.490
Um... I'm--

29:42.573 --> 29:44.200
I-- I don't want to keep you.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.951
Yeah, I'm running
late for something.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.495
Yeah.

29:47.578 --> 29:48.621
It was good to see you.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.206
Nice to see you.

29:57.755 --> 30:00.549
Dude, I am so sorry about this.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.385
You know, you're gonna
be sad for a few weeks.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.845
Maybe a few months,

30:04.929 --> 30:07.097
but I promise you'll
get over this.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.892
I know,

30:09.975 --> 30:11.936
but I don't want to be sad.

30:12.061 --> 30:13.479
I want to be happy.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.483
I want to be really
happy with her.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.778
Yeah, but did you really
think this scenario through?

30:20.861 --> 30:22.696
I mean, what was gonna happen?

30:22.780 --> 30:25.282
She was gonna break up with Pino?
Move to New York?

30:25.366 --> 30:28.702
I mean, that's so much
pressure for both of you guys.

30:28.786 --> 30:31.080
I mean, she's lived in this
tiny village her whole life.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.082
She's been with one dude.

30:33.165 --> 30:37.461
Your relationship probably wasn't gonna be
this magical fantasy that's in your head.

30:37.545 --> 30:39.630
It was probably gonna
be a shit-show.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.676
I just thought we'd
figure it out.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.266
You know...

30:51.809 --> 30:54.895
I don't even know
if it's about her.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.022
I just--

30:57.106 --> 30:59.149
I miss that feeling.

30:59.233 --> 31:02.361
When we were together,
doing all that stuff...

31:05.072 --> 31:08.534
I felt really connected
to somebody.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.328
And it felt good.

31:14.415 --> 31:17.042
Now I just feel fucking alone.

31:17.126 --> 31:19.336
You know what you really
need is a distraction,

31:19.420 --> 31:21.297
something to get
your mind off this.

31:21.964 --> 31:24.008
So don't go home and look at

31:24.091 --> 31:26.010
old photos and videos of
us being happy together?

31:26.093 --> 31:28.387
I would stop doing
that immediately.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.972
But what I want you to do

31:30.055 --> 31:33.267
is go home, put on the
dumbest movie you can find,

31:33.350 --> 31:35.603
and watch that.

31:35.686 --> 31:37.438
That's...

31:37.521 --> 31:39.773
actually not a bad idea.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.068
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

33:06.151 --> 33:07.861
- We're gonna take a video.
- Okay.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.321
This is for, um, it's for

33:09.405 --> 33:10.698
Future Dev and Future Francesca.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.241
- Ah. Okay.
- Okay? Yeah?

33:12.324 --> 33:13.993
- Put it better, like...
- Okay, all right.

33:14.076 --> 33:15.661
...like, show
Washington Square Park.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.246
- That's good.
- Look at this.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.707
- Hello, future guys.
- Hi, how are you guys?

33:19.790 --> 33:22.418
Hope you're well. We just
wanted to make this video

33:22.501 --> 33:24.420
to remind you of the
really fun night we had.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.547
And I hope you guys are happy.

33:26.630 --> 33:30.884
Yeah. Maybe you're watching
this in different places

33:30.968 --> 33:32.636
or maybe you're together.
Who knows?

33:32.720 --> 33:33.554
Yeah.

33:33.637 --> 33:35.389
Whatever's going
on, hope you're happy.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.182
- Yes.
- Bye!

33:37.266 --> 33:38.559
Ciao.
