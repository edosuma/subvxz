WEBVTT

00:00.082 --> 00:01.649
<i>Previously on Sanctuary</i> ...

00:01.650 --> 00:03.976
We were a part of something,
something we called the five,

00:04.494 --> 00:06.228
a small group dedicated
to expanding our knowledge

00:06.328 --> 00:07.462
of the physical world.

00:07.543 --> 00:10.378
Your mother was able to procure
a very rare sample

00:10.379 --> 00:13.748
of ancient untainted
vampire blood.

00:13.749 --> 00:15.517
After each of us was injected,

00:15.518 --> 00:18.386
we received unique gifts
as a result.

00:18.387 --> 00:20.155
John, let me help you
before you make things worse.

00:21.390 --> 00:22.590
That thing was my rage.

00:22.591 --> 00:23.692
You kept it at bay.

00:23.693 --> 00:25.060
I need to leave now.

00:25.061 --> 00:26.294
Where are you going?

00:26.295 --> 00:28.530
My father
never gave me a gift

00:28.531 --> 00:29.764
without significance.

00:29.765 --> 00:31.132
Do you think
it exists?

00:31.133 --> 00:32.299
Well, if it does,
we have to find it.

00:32.301 --> 00:33.635
Who are you?

00:33.636 --> 00:35.670
Helen, you look beautiful.

00:37.540 --> 00:39.541
Hologram? City?

00:42.478 --> 00:43.478
Adam...

00:43.479 --> 00:45.580
This is impossible.
You're dead.

00:48.050 --> 00:50.151
If you want to save Gregory,
you need me!

00:50.152 --> 00:51.553
Me!

00:58.494 --> 00:59.694
Helen.

00:59.695 --> 01:00.862
Doc! Oh, my God.

01:00.863 --> 01:01.830
Security cell
for this guy

01:01.831 --> 01:02.797
as soon as he's
out of the or.

01:02.798 --> 01:04.699
Yeah, done.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.368
You're injured.

01:06.369 --> 01:07.635
We need to send
a full Hazmat team

01:07.636 --> 01:08.603
and cordon off the area
from the public.

01:08.604 --> 01:10.105
Spin whatever
disaster story you need

01:10.106 --> 01:11.306
to get it done.

01:11.307 --> 01:13.074
Okay, well, biggie's
on his way to meet Kate.

01:13.075 --> 01:14.242
What the hell
happened over there?

01:14.243 --> 01:16.177
Nothing
we understand yet.

01:16.178 --> 01:17.412
Copy that.

01:17.413 --> 01:18.413
Son of a bitch.

01:18.414 --> 01:19.948
Who we got?

01:19.949 --> 01:22.851
Well, I guess cockroaches can
come back from the dead.

01:22.852 --> 01:24.085
Who the hell is this guy?

01:24.086 --> 01:25.253
Not one person
but two.

01:26.589 --> 01:29.457
Prepare to meet Jekyll and Hyde.

It's not necessary.

01:57.629 --> 01:58.929
He just kicked

Let me help.

Your pupils are dilated,

02:11.096 --> 02:13.731
Fair enough.

02:22.936 --> 02:25.971

02:36.709 --> 02:37.909
Nigel, the source blood, please.

02:42.849 --> 02:44.049
John,

02:44.050 --> 02:46.017
the culture?

02:46.018 --> 02:47.152
Ready and waiting.

02:47.153 --> 02:48.253
Remember
the protocols.

02:48.254 --> 02:49.287
No mistakes.

02:49.288 --> 02:50.555
Relax, James,

02:50.556 --> 02:51.356
we've done
our homework.

02:51.357 --> 02:52.657
Please, Tesla,

02:52.658 --> 02:53.992
we're improvising,
and you know it.

02:53.993 --> 02:56.795
Well, perhaps it's too rich
for your blood, hmm?

02:56.796 --> 02:57.996
Oh, I'm in, mate.

02:57.997 --> 02:58.797
Just to see
what happens to you.

03:04.303 --> 03:05.203
Oh, for heaven's sake.

03:06.672 --> 03:08.139
I thought
I locked the door.

03:08.140 --> 03:10.242
Oh, you did.

03:10.243 --> 03:11.476
I was just wondering

03:11.477 --> 03:13.078
how the experiment
was coming along.

03:13.079 --> 03:14.746
Don't you have
somewhere else to be?

03:14.747 --> 03:15.747
A lecture?

03:15.748 --> 03:18.183
Must be very important,
whatever it is.

03:18.184 --> 03:19.851
It's been keeping
you all quite busy

03:19.852 --> 03:21.786
the last few weeks.

03:21.787 --> 03:23.688
I believe Mr. Worth
has been spying on us.

03:23.689 --> 03:25.223
I believe you're right.
Mr. Worth--

03:25.224 --> 03:27.259
Adam, please.

03:27.260 --> 03:28.860
You can trust me.

03:30.296 --> 03:32.731
Secret shipments of plasma?

03:32.732 --> 03:35.233
Sounds
very exciting.

03:35.234 --> 03:36.868
Is it some kind of
a new breakthrough

03:36.869 --> 03:39.204
of some sort?

03:41.240 --> 03:43.041
I could be
quite useful to you.

03:43.042 --> 03:44.576
Mm-hmm.

03:44.577 --> 03:45.744
Top marks in me anatomy course.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.801
Homicidal
little bastard.

04:09.802 --> 04:12.237
He should have
come after me first.

04:12.238 --> 04:13.705
Is this how
all Oxford classmates

04:13.706 --> 04:15.640
treat each other?

04:15.641 --> 04:16.675
How much did she tell you?

04:16.676 --> 04:19.844
Just that the five
was almost the six.

04:19.845 --> 04:22.847
Yes, well, in retrospect,
there were signs.

04:22.848 --> 04:25.684
Subtle markers...

04:25.685 --> 04:28.320
<i>But we were young,</i>

04:28.321 --> 04:31.923
<i>and, believe it or not,</i>
<i>even a tad arrogant.</i>

04:31.924 --> 04:34.793
You have to admit
he's brilliant.

04:34.794 --> 04:36.261
And British.

04:36.262 --> 04:38.096
Hysterical.

04:38.097 --> 04:39.297
Does anyone else
notice

04:39.298 --> 04:40.932
something odd
about Adam?

04:40.933 --> 04:41.800
He just
pointed it out.

04:41.801 --> 04:42.601
He's British.

04:42.602 --> 04:43.768
He's an excitable

04:43.769 --> 04:45.270
little chap, isn't he?

04:45.271 --> 04:46.271
Anyone read
his monograph

04:46.272 --> 04:48.273
on forced tissue
regeneration?

04:48.274 --> 04:49.741
That thing he did
with Dormice?

04:49.742 --> 04:51.209
Mmm.

04:51.210 --> 04:52.611
Poor creatures
grew two heads.

04:52.612 --> 04:53.878
Very nearly
worked, though.

04:53.879 --> 04:55.280
A daring theory,
to say the least.

04:55.281 --> 04:57.849
I'd lean more towards
twisted, myself.

04:57.850 --> 05:00.318
Twisted, daring,
it doesn't matter.

05:00.319 --> 05:01.953
The point is,
we don't need anyone else.

05:01.954 --> 05:03.188
The five of us
are enough.

05:03.189 --> 05:04.289
I agree.

05:04.290 --> 05:06.391
As clever
as Adam is,

05:06.392 --> 05:08.259
our group is fine without him.

05:23.743 --> 05:24.876
Dear lord, Adam.

05:24.877 --> 05:27.412
Looks like the formula
for some kind of toxin.

05:27.413 --> 05:28.313
No, no, no.

05:28.314 --> 05:30.281
Just, uh,
some scribbles.

05:30.282 --> 05:32.851
Well? Am I in?

05:34.387 --> 05:36.121
You are a brilliant scientist.

05:37.690 --> 05:39.090
You don't need us.

05:39.091 --> 05:41.793
No, you don't see.
You need me.

05:41.794 --> 05:44.863
You need me!

05:47.266 --> 05:50.935
I'm sorry. I just...

05:50.936 --> 05:53.972
I belong with you,
Tesla, and Watson.

05:53.973 --> 05:54.806
I'm one of you.

05:56.242 --> 05:59.310
You will have
an amazing career, Adam,

05:59.311 --> 06:01.212
but we're heading
on a different path.

06:01.213 --> 06:04.115
What did I do
to turn you all against me?

06:05.751 --> 06:06.751
I can help.

06:08.454 --> 06:10.255
Let me help.

06:11.924 --> 06:13.258
I'm sorry, Adam.

06:26.072 --> 06:29.107
This doesn't make any sense.

06:29.108 --> 06:30.775
I stopped
the internal bleeding.

06:30.776 --> 06:31.976
I salved the burn
on his arm,

06:31.977 --> 06:33.311
and there's no sign
of infection.

06:33.312 --> 06:36.047
Sounds like
a hat trick to me.

06:36.048 --> 06:39.284
Then why are
his organs failing?

06:52.798 --> 06:54.299
Yeah, I know.
You've been waiting.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.867
Listen, I've been
working like a dog--

06:55.868 --> 06:57.001
v-very hard--

06:57.002 --> 06:59.804
to get all this back
intact, more or less.

06:59.805 --> 07:01.005
I'm not here
to rush you.

07:01.006 --> 07:02.273
What? You're not?

07:02.274 --> 07:04.976
No, I just wanted to see
if you needed some help.

07:04.977 --> 07:06.945
Uh, no, no, I got it.

07:06.946 --> 07:07.979
Interesting.
May I, uh?

07:07.980 --> 07:09.047
Listen,
whatever this is

07:09.048 --> 07:10.115
almost got the doc
killed, okay?

07:10.116 --> 07:11.082
So, we need to--

07:11.083 --> 07:12.851
I understand.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.221
Seamless construction.

07:16.222 --> 07:17.388
Perhaps a special
milling.

07:17.389 --> 07:19.591
Or it's an organic
hybrid compound.

07:19.592 --> 07:20.425
But then
I'd expect to see

07:20.426 --> 07:21.893
some structural
deterioration.

07:23.195 --> 07:24.195
Yeah, that's true.

07:24.196 --> 07:25.230
Which I don't.

07:25.231 --> 07:26.197
You don't.

07:26.198 --> 07:27.432
No.

07:27.433 --> 07:29.100
Do you think it's something
Worth created?

07:29.101 --> 07:31.202
Or appropriated.

07:31.203 --> 07:33.371
Stolen from hollow earth?

07:33.372 --> 07:35.406
Well, perhaps
you and I can see

07:35.407 --> 07:36.441
if we can get it
working again.

07:36.442 --> 07:37.675
What do you say?

07:37.676 --> 07:39.544
Yeah!-- Wait,
is that safe?

07:39.545 --> 07:40.411
Oh, no, most definitely not.

07:40.412 --> 07:41.246
No, if--

07:41.247 --> 07:42.347
thank you.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.116
Um...

07:46.318 --> 07:48.186
Adam's blood
and tissue samples.

07:48.187 --> 07:50.255
What's up with
these cell walls?

07:50.256 --> 07:52.490
Degrading
at an alarming rate.

07:52.491 --> 07:55.360
Well, that's
some kind of virus.

07:55.361 --> 07:57.562
It's not wholly systemic.

07:57.563 --> 08:00.064
It seems to be targeting
his critical organs.

08:00.065 --> 08:03.234
I suspect it's some form
of radiation sickness.

08:03.235 --> 08:04.536
The man did
figure out a way

08:04.537 --> 08:06.104
to speed up time.

08:06.105 --> 08:08.506
I'm assuming
this is the price.

08:08.507 --> 08:10.875
I may be able to slow
the deterioration, but--

08:10.876 --> 08:12.310
He's dying.

08:12.311 --> 08:13.711
Yes.

08:13.712 --> 08:14.813
<i>Good afternoon,</i>

08:14.814 --> 08:16.080
<i>K-mart shoppers...</i>

08:16.081 --> 08:20.051
<i>Our guest is awake.</i>

08:23.022 --> 08:24.322
Your protege?

08:24.323 --> 08:26.491
Or a male
concubine?

08:28.027 --> 08:29.093
He's nice.

08:29.094 --> 08:30.128
Adam--

08:30.129 --> 08:31.529
not available.

08:33.131 --> 08:35.400
Tell me, how is this,
any of this, possible?

08:35.400 --> 08:37.268
You mean how did I survive?

08:40.039 --> 08:41.072
Tell me your secrets,

08:41.073 --> 08:42.874
I'll tell you mine.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.976
You're ill.
You need treatment.

08:44.977 --> 08:47.045
Help us,
and we'll help you.

08:47.046 --> 08:50.982
Oh, Helen,
you've grown so impatient

08:50.983 --> 08:52.951
in your old age.

08:52.952 --> 08:55.920
Play the game,
don't just berate me.

08:55.921 --> 08:57.388
You could
have just

08:57.389 --> 08:58.456
let him die.

08:58.457 --> 09:00.225
I think
you might want

09:00.226 --> 09:02.527
to tick that one
off your list.

09:02.528 --> 09:04.362
How are you still alive?

09:04.363 --> 09:05.997
He really didn't tell you?

09:05.998 --> 09:07.332
Who?

09:07.333 --> 09:09.000
Good lad.

09:09.001 --> 09:10.368
So he carved up a few whores.

09:10.369 --> 09:12.036
We all have
our quirks.

09:12.037 --> 09:13.438
You're talking about Druitt.

09:13.439 --> 09:17.542
Score one for the concubine.

09:17.543 --> 09:22.914
Helen, if you want answers,
you must talk to old Johnny.

09:24.183 --> 09:25.183
I can't.

09:25.184 --> 09:26.417
Helen...

09:26.418 --> 09:28.586
I don't know where he is.

09:28.587 --> 09:30.455
He could well be dead,
for all we know.

09:32.091 --> 09:33.358
Uh, actually...

09:34.994 --> 09:36.160
Oh, what have you done?

09:37.396 --> 09:39.297
Nikola?

09:39.298 --> 09:41.232
You know where he is.

09:42.301 --> 09:43.601
Kinda?

09:47.167 --> 09:48.500
Really, Nikola,

09:48.501 --> 09:51.152
of all the arrogant,
inconsiderate, conceited--

09:51.252 --> 09:54.454
Okay, okay, can we
move on, please?

09:56.057 --> 09:57.558
Listen, Druitt
came to me.

09:57.559 --> 10:00.127
He had this crazy idea
that my electromagnetism

10:00.128 --> 10:02.329
could help exorcise
his on-board energy elemental.

10:02.330 --> 10:03.897
Do tell.

10:03.898 --> 10:07.134
Well, I tried to help,
give him back some control.

10:07.135 --> 10:08.101
And?

10:08.102 --> 10:09.102
You know Johnny.

10:09.103 --> 10:11.171
The word "failure"
comes to mind.

10:11.172 --> 10:13.540
He's still his nasty old self,
what can I say?

10:13.541 --> 10:15.976
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

10:15.977 --> 10:18.045
Because
I promised not to.

10:19.447 --> 10:21.148
And you are nothing
if not a man of your word.

10:21.149 --> 10:23.050
When it counts.

10:23.051 --> 10:25.619
Look, Johnny and I may
detest each other, it's true,

10:25.620 --> 10:27.521
but with me
no longer being a vampire,

10:27.522 --> 10:29.656
and him still being
a stone cold killer,

10:29.657 --> 10:31.525
well, I really
wasn't in a position

10:31.526 --> 10:33.627
to negotiate.

10:33.628 --> 10:35.028
Where is he?

10:46.441 --> 10:48.542
Did you bring me jello?

10:55.483 --> 10:59.553
Sorry about the two I sent over
to pick your brain.

10:59.554 --> 11:00.988
It was business.

11:00.989 --> 11:02.389
Didn't work out
too well, did it?

11:02.390 --> 11:05.092
Good help these days.

11:05.093 --> 11:07.127
How did you know
we have the map?

11:09.697 --> 11:12.165
Tell me a story, concubine.

11:12.166 --> 11:14.735
Why don't you tell me one?

11:14.736 --> 11:18.071
Adam sends his love.

11:18.072 --> 11:21.041
Yeah, I'd like to talk to him
if I could.

11:22.543 --> 11:23.710
No.

11:23.711 --> 11:26.179
Are you ashamed
to let him speak?

11:27.949 --> 11:32.319
The lad's a genius,
a forgotten brilliant mind.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.687
Who needs
your protection.

11:33.688 --> 11:37.090
I mean, without you,
Adam would be very vulnerable.

11:37.091 --> 11:39.393
Affirmation
of my psychodynamic,

11:39.394 --> 11:43.430
rationalizing
my warring personalities.

11:43.431 --> 11:46.700
Looking for a doorway
into my world?

11:46.701 --> 11:50.637
Who said
you could work with men?

11:50.638 --> 11:52.639
You're a child.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.409
I just want to help
both of you.

11:58.479 --> 12:01.448
Please help me, concubine.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.218
Satisfied?

12:07.221 --> 12:08.255
Jello, huh?

12:08.256 --> 12:09.456
Mm.

12:09.457 --> 12:10.590
I'll see what I can do.

12:15.630 --> 12:16.997
If you turn
your back on him,

12:16.998 --> 12:18.699
you'll never find it.

12:20.335 --> 12:23.337
The underground city.

12:26.507 --> 12:31.111
No nasty comments,
no sarcastic cracks...

12:31.112 --> 12:32.379
You okay?

12:34.082 --> 12:36.216
No, I'm not okay.

12:36.217 --> 12:37.317
It took me--

12:37.318 --> 12:39.219
me, mind you--

12:39.220 --> 12:40.654
days to crack

12:40.655 --> 12:43.457
that holographic pinata
up in the library,

12:43.458 --> 12:46.593
and then, after several
bottles of chablis,

12:46.594 --> 12:49.062
I finally get over
my humiliation,

12:49.063 --> 12:51.231
and now this shipment
of fresh hell arrives!

12:51.232 --> 12:52.766
Okay, find your happy place.

12:54.268 --> 12:56.303
I mean,
this is technology that--

12:56.304 --> 13:02.242
that I've never seen before,
much less imagined, and...

13:02.243 --> 13:03.377
To be brutally honest--

13:03.378 --> 13:06.279
and I don't want this
getting out...

13:08.249 --> 13:11.385
I find it rather humbling,
and I don't do humble.

13:12.453 --> 13:15.322
Copy that.

13:15.323 --> 13:17.124
Okay, well, maybe
if we pry all this open--

13:17.125 --> 13:18.358
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

13:18.359 --> 13:19.693
Well, we've x-rayed it,
we've pinged it--

13:19.694 --> 13:21.361
dropped it
on the floor.

13:21.362 --> 13:22.562
You saw that,
did you?

13:22.563 --> 13:24.264
And I didn't
say anything.

13:24.265 --> 13:26.400
Well, I'm pretty sure
it's not going to go boom.

13:27.402 --> 13:28.402
Okay, have at it.

13:39.313 --> 13:40.781
Huh?

13:40.782 --> 13:43.216
Nice work, Heinrich.

13:44.352 --> 13:47.087
Organic
nanite matter...

13:48.456 --> 13:50.090
Cool.

14:03.871 --> 14:06.139
Have you seen this man?

14:09.110 --> 14:10.844
Excuse me,
have you seen this man?

14:16.517 --> 14:17.651
Lady! Lady!

14:17.652 --> 14:19.820
You looking for
tall bald guy, yes?

14:19.821 --> 14:21.521
This man.
Have you seen him?

14:22.590 --> 14:24.191
Uh...

14:24.192 --> 14:26.426
$100 U.S.

14:27.762 --> 14:28.895
No tricks.

14:28.896 --> 14:30.163
No tricks!

14:30.164 --> 14:31.498
100.

14:35.803 --> 14:36.870
I'll give you the address.

14:38.239 --> 14:39.673
No, you'll take me there.

14:45.313 --> 14:46.913
You should feel honored.

14:46.914 --> 14:49.182
Adam?

14:49.183 --> 14:50.884
A very few surface dwellers

14:50.885 --> 14:52.486
have seen the things
you've seen.

14:52.487 --> 14:54.621
You mean Kali?

14:54.622 --> 14:56.623
And the Avatar council,

14:56.624 --> 14:58.892
and they let you live.

14:58.893 --> 15:00.193
Astonishing, really.

15:00.194 --> 15:02.629
Who is the council?

15:02.630 --> 15:04.698
Are they part of
the underground city?

15:04.699 --> 15:08.568
"Deep into the darkness
peering,

15:08.569 --> 15:10.871
long I stood there,

15:10.872 --> 15:12.839
wondering, fearing,

15:12.840 --> 15:16.576
doubting,

15:16.577 --> 15:19.513
dreaming dreams no mortal
dared to dream before."

15:19.514 --> 15:21.414
Poe.

15:21.415 --> 15:23.583
Now, <i> there</i> was a wack job.

15:23.584 --> 15:26.520
What, do you think
you're a wack job?

15:27.755 --> 15:31.358
Whatever gave you that idea?

15:31.359 --> 15:32.659
You were going to tell me
about the city.

15:34.562 --> 15:36.429
How do you stand it?

15:37.532 --> 15:39.666
Working for
that heartless bitch.

15:43.704 --> 15:44.771
She angers you.

15:44.772 --> 15:46.540
She murdered my daughter!

15:49.877 --> 15:53.713
You have no idea
who she really is, do you?

15:53.714 --> 15:56.783
<i>She's hardly the hero</i>
<i>you think she is.</i>

15:58.753 --> 16:01.321
Open the bloody door,
or I'll throttle you.

16:01.322 --> 16:04.257
Let me in.
She won't mind.

16:04.258 --> 16:06.459
All right?

16:06.460 --> 16:08.295
Adam, what are you doing here?

16:08.296 --> 16:10.497
Helen, I'm sorry
to intrude.

16:10.498 --> 16:11.631
James...

16:11.632 --> 16:13.233
Burned down any more
laboratories recently?

16:13.234 --> 16:16.236
That was 10 years ago,
and it was an accident.

16:16.237 --> 16:17.237
Really?

16:17.238 --> 16:18.538
What do you want, Adam?

16:18.539 --> 16:20.307
I need your help, Helen,
rather urgently, I'm afraid.

16:20.308 --> 16:21.775
Indeed?

16:21.776 --> 16:24.277
It's me daughter, Imogene.

16:24.278 --> 16:26.713
She's gravely ill.
A rare blood disease.

16:26.714 --> 16:27.914
I've tried everything,

16:27.915 --> 16:29.382
every treatment,
every method possible.

16:29.383 --> 16:31.518
Then what do you
expect of me?

16:31.519 --> 16:34.387
Well, I've been
following your work.

16:34.388 --> 16:35.355
You're known as an expert

16:35.356 --> 16:36.456
in the fringes
of medical science.

16:36.457 --> 16:38.425
My research
is private.

16:38.426 --> 16:39.726
Helen...

16:39.727 --> 16:43.930
You must know by my being here
how desperate I am.

16:43.931 --> 16:45.298
I beg of you, help her.

16:46.901 --> 16:48.835
I've collected as much
data on her condition

16:48.836 --> 16:50.003
as I can.

16:50.004 --> 16:51.004
Not yet.

16:51.005 --> 16:53.773
Helen...

16:56.744 --> 16:58.645
Look at
the white cells.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.984
There's no chance.

17:05.987 --> 17:07.454
What is it?

17:07.454 --> 17:10.790
Your daughter has
a rare form of leukemia.

17:10.790 --> 17:12.959
I'm afraid there's
nothing I can do.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.295
But you've done experiments
with blood injections before.

17:15.296 --> 17:16.296
Rare blood

17:16.297 --> 17:17.130
with amazing
properties.

17:17.131 --> 17:18.031
Not on a child.

17:18.031 --> 17:19.898
She's my daughter.

17:19.900 --> 17:22.469
And you have
my condolences.

17:23.971 --> 17:24.771
James.

17:24.771 --> 17:26.673
Wait.

17:26.674 --> 17:28.742
Helen...

17:28.743 --> 17:29.809
James!

17:31.612 --> 17:33.313
Damn you...

17:56.937 --> 17:59.072
So he's in here?

18:01.942 --> 18:04.511
Aw...

18:04.512 --> 18:06.913
This is a bad place
for you, girlfriend.

18:12.381 --> 18:13.640
We take the rest
of your money now.

18:13.852 --> 18:14.618
Really?

18:16.903 --> 18:19.271
Fine.

18:19.410 --> 18:20.443
Just relax...

18:23.347 --> 18:25.715
See? There's plenty here
for everyone.

18:32.190 --> 18:33.056
Seriously?

18:33.057 --> 18:34.357
Move!

18:35.793 --> 18:37.227
How old are you?

18:37.228 --> 18:38.895
Walking about with a gun
like this,

18:38.896 --> 18:39.963
you should be ashamed.

18:39.964 --> 18:42.766
Hey, lady,
we're on the job here.

18:42.767 --> 18:44.267
Bald head guy,
he pay us to protect him.

18:44.268 --> 18:45.735
Told us we can
shoot anyone

18:45.736 --> 18:47.170
who looking for him.

18:47.171 --> 18:48.772
So you really do know
where he is?

18:48.773 --> 18:50.740
Of course they do.

19:03.981 --> 19:07.217
You're all fired.

19:07.218 --> 19:08.184
Without...

19:08.185 --> 19:10.053
The weapons.

19:10.054 --> 19:10.887
Go.

19:23.667 --> 19:24.734
John...

19:24.735 --> 19:25.902
Helen--

19:25.903 --> 19:27.804
oh, my God.

19:29.139 --> 19:32.141
Oh, my God, your pulse.

19:32.142 --> 19:33.610
Tesla.

19:33.611 --> 19:36.179
Never trust a former vampire.

19:36.180 --> 19:37.814
I coerced him.

19:37.815 --> 19:39.816
Hold still.

19:39.817 --> 19:41.851
I'm all right.

19:41.852 --> 19:43.152
What have you taken?

19:43.153 --> 19:47.724
Oh, a little of this,
and a little of that.

19:47.725 --> 19:49.125
Local fare to kill the soul.

19:49.126 --> 19:50.126
Here.

19:56.000 --> 19:56.966
Why?

19:56.967 --> 20:00.069
Adam Worth. He's alive.

20:00.070 --> 20:04.741
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's impossible.

20:04.742 --> 20:05.642
Yes, I thought so too.

20:07.711 --> 20:09.746
<i>Yes, I am a physician...</i>

20:09.747 --> 20:11.247
But I can't see

20:11.248 --> 20:13.750
how that would concern
the Prime Minister's office.

20:13.751 --> 20:15.551
Well, I think
you'll agree,

20:15.552 --> 20:17.787
you're not just
any physician.

20:17.788 --> 20:18.821
Because I'm a woman?

20:21.492 --> 20:23.760
Well, of course,
in and of itself,

20:23.761 --> 20:25.795
that is, uh, odd.

20:25.796 --> 20:27.964
But no,

20:27.965 --> 20:29.966
I was thinking more

20:29.967 --> 20:33.102
of your work with strange
and dangerous creatures.

20:33.103 --> 20:35.171
Abnormals,

20:35.172 --> 20:36.706
I believe
you call them.

20:36.707 --> 20:39.108
You see, we know all about
your father's Sanctuary,

20:39.109 --> 20:41.878
and you taking up
his mantle.

20:41.879 --> 20:43.746
Prime Minister, I'm afraid
you've been misinformed.

20:43.747 --> 20:45.148
I really don't
understand--

20:45.149 --> 20:46.215
Oh, excuse me.

20:46.216 --> 20:48.785
That'll be
the others.

20:51.088 --> 20:53.189
Nigel Griffin...

20:55.259 --> 20:58.561
Invisible man.

20:58.562 --> 21:00.730
Doctor James Watson,

21:00.731 --> 21:04.834
Detective supreme,

21:04.835 --> 21:06.969
and Nikola Tesla,

21:06.970 --> 21:08.671
vampire,

21:08.672 --> 21:10.173
genius,

21:10.174 --> 21:14.143
and montague John Druitt...

21:16.113 --> 21:17.780
Menace to society.

21:19.316 --> 21:22.785
So...

21:22.786 --> 21:25.555
Down to business?

21:26.990 --> 21:29.792
You see, we've known about
you and your colleagues

21:29.793 --> 21:30.827
for some time,

21:30.828 --> 21:33.162
and we've given you
your head

21:33.163 --> 21:34.197
because we thought
the day would come

21:34.198 --> 21:37.066
when the five of you
might prove useful.

21:37.067 --> 21:38.267
Well, I'm flattered.

21:38.268 --> 21:39.235
That day is here.

21:39.236 --> 21:41.137
I'm proud to offer you now

21:41.138 --> 21:43.639
the opportunity
to serve your country.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.641
I'm Serbian.

21:45.642 --> 21:47.543
Just ignore him.

21:47.544 --> 21:50.279
Why are you here,
exactly?

21:50.280 --> 21:53.783
You are aware of a gentleman
called Adam Worth?

21:53.784 --> 21:55.718
You mean
the pipsqueak from school?

21:55.719 --> 21:58.187
Well, once, perhaps,

21:58.188 --> 22:02.191
but now a genius mind
warped by rage and mania,

22:02.192 --> 22:04.794
and, I might add,
quite a headache

22:04.795 --> 22:06.262
for our secret
service bureau.

22:06.263 --> 22:08.064
A man after my own heart.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.700
And I would dispute
the term "genius."

22:10.701 --> 22:13.102
Yes, we did know Adam
years ago,

22:13.103 --> 22:15.271
but we've not
seen him since then.

22:15.272 --> 22:17.607
What's he done?

22:17.608 --> 22:19.041
Well, our service agents
tell us

22:19.042 --> 22:22.011
that Mr. Worth has amassed
the funds and the technology

22:22.012 --> 22:23.780
to enact a great
and dangerous crime

22:23.781 --> 22:25.248
upon this city.

22:25.249 --> 22:26.516
Which is?

22:26.517 --> 22:29.619
A rather deadly toxin
has been stolen,

22:29.620 --> 22:33.856
and a great many britons
may die as a result.

22:33.857 --> 22:35.825
Well, surely the crown has
a means of stopping him?

22:35.826 --> 22:38.127
Well, I'm afraid
Mr. Worth's organization

22:38.128 --> 22:40.797
has grown roots deep inside
British society,

22:40.798 --> 22:43.966
and, I am sorry to say,
deep inside my government, too.

22:43.967 --> 22:46.335
You need a group
of independent agents.

22:46.336 --> 22:48.738
With special talents.

22:48.739 --> 22:50.740
Who are acquainted
with his past.

22:50.741 --> 22:52.308
How certain are you
of this threat?

22:52.309 --> 22:53.976
The stakes could not be higher.

22:58.015 --> 23:00.049
<i>...And seeing as London</i>

23:00.050 --> 23:01.918
was a little more
interesting than Budapest

23:01.919 --> 23:03.085
at the time...

23:03.086 --> 23:05.188
You all volunteered
to stop him.

23:05.189 --> 23:06.589
Something like that.

23:06.590 --> 23:07.857
Man, that is
so James Bond.

23:07.858 --> 23:09.926
Except it's before
there was a James Bond,

23:09.927 --> 23:10.893
so it's... cooler.

23:10.894 --> 23:12.895
Damn.

23:12.896 --> 23:14.831
What's up?

23:14.832 --> 23:16.566
Uh, I'm just going over
the latest blood tests

23:16.567 --> 23:17.667
from Worth.

23:17.668 --> 23:19.135
Please tell me
he's dying.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.903
He is.

23:20.904 --> 23:22.071
Even with Magnus'
treatments,

23:22.072 --> 23:24.340
his organs are
continuing to deteriorate.

23:24.341 --> 23:26.209
Oh, I was wrong,
there is a God.

23:26.210 --> 23:28.878
But that's not
the worst of it.

23:28.879 --> 23:30.847
I cross-referenced
his bloodwork

23:30.848 --> 23:33.216
with another
set of samples.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.600
Just so you know,

24:24.601 --> 24:28.037
I've forgiven you
for shooting me.

24:28.038 --> 24:30.773
Just tell me
the killing has stopped.

24:30.774 --> 24:32.642
So we're returning
to lying to one another?

24:32.643 --> 24:35.678
Once this is over,
when we find Adam--

24:35.679 --> 24:36.946
you and I,
we'll settle down

24:36.947 --> 24:38.447
in a quaint little
cottage by the sea,

24:38.448 --> 24:41.284
and I'll write poetry.
Sonnets, perhaps!

24:41.285 --> 24:42.151
As much as
I can never forgive you

24:42.152 --> 24:43.753
for what you've done,

24:43.754 --> 24:45.454
I can never forgive myself
for not seeing it sooner.

24:45.455 --> 24:47.089
When this is over,

24:47.090 --> 24:48.391
you and I will begin
our dance anew.

24:48.392 --> 24:50.826
Count on it.

24:53.764 --> 24:55.665
Helen!

24:57.834 --> 24:59.902
You all right?

24:59.903 --> 25:01.804
Fine.

25:01.805 --> 25:03.406
News?

25:03.407 --> 25:04.674
Nigel and Tesla
may have a lead.

25:04.675 --> 25:05.875
They've tracked
one of Worth's associates

25:05.876 --> 25:07.243
down to docklands.

25:23.460 --> 25:28.197
I owe you nothing.

25:28.198 --> 25:31.834
Leave me be.

25:32.936 --> 25:34.070
I'm sorry, John,
to do this,

25:34.071 --> 25:36.038
but I need answers.

25:36.039 --> 25:37.106
Helen...

25:40.344 --> 25:42.411
No...

25:53.323 --> 25:54.924
John's in the infirmary.

25:54.925 --> 25:57.293
I've told Henry to activate
the em shield again.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.961
And the gang's
all here.

25:58.962 --> 26:00.262
So, what
have you found?

26:00.263 --> 26:01.864
Oh, damn.

26:01.865 --> 26:04.133
The platelets
are continuing to group.

26:04.134 --> 26:05.401
At this rate, he'll experience

26:05.402 --> 26:06.902
complete organ failure

26:06.903 --> 26:08.437
and be dead within
a matter of weeks.

26:08.438 --> 26:09.271
That's not Adam's blood.

26:09.272 --> 26:12.208
What?

26:12.209 --> 26:14.810
It's yours.

26:23.947 --> 26:25.173
<i>There has to be</i>
<i>something.</i>

26:25.722 --> 26:26.894
Drugs that manage

26:26.994 --> 26:28.061
the effects
of chemotherapy.

26:28.062 --> 26:29.896
Anti-radiation
treatments.

26:29.897 --> 26:31.865
I doubt any conventional
approach would work.

26:33.100 --> 26:35.902
This wasn't a normal dose
of radiation, will.

26:35.903 --> 26:37.037
It was something
the human body

26:37.038 --> 26:38.204
was never meant
to be exposed to.

26:38.205 --> 26:41.875
Moving through dimensions
of time and space...

26:43.544 --> 26:46.079
It sounds so ridiculous
when I say it out loud.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.180
And yet
it's killing you.

26:47.181 --> 26:49.082
Poison's a poison.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.283
Then we'll find the antidote.

26:50.284 --> 26:53.820
We will whip Tesla
like a rented mule...

26:53.821 --> 26:54.788
Until he makes
a breakthrough.

26:54.789 --> 26:56.890
I like the whipping Tesla idea.

26:56.891 --> 26:58.725
Oh, dear.

26:58.726 --> 26:59.592
Hey...

26:59.593 --> 27:00.894
No, I'm all right.

27:00.895 --> 27:03.797
I just, uh,
I haven't eaten in while.

27:03.798 --> 27:05.932
So, what have you learned
about Adam?

27:05.933 --> 27:07.133
No, no, no, you're exhausted.

27:07.134 --> 27:08.501
This can wait.

27:08.502 --> 27:09.602
We both know it can't.

27:12.807 --> 27:15.542
He's a textbook
dissociative.

27:15.543 --> 27:16.776
Obviously there are

27:16.777 --> 27:17.844
two distinct
personalities

27:17.845 --> 27:19.079
wrestling for control.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.114
The bully and the victim,
all in one neat package.

27:21.115 --> 27:22.682
Yeah.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.552
My sense is that it's from
sustained post-traumatic stress

27:25.553 --> 27:28.154
resulting from...

27:28.155 --> 27:29.089
The loss of his daughter.

27:29.090 --> 27:30.523
Which he blames me for.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.793
You and Watson.

27:33.794 --> 27:35.862
He says that you both
refused to help.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.764
Of course he does.

27:40.267 --> 27:43.570
Five milligrams
diluted arsenic, James.

27:43.571 --> 27:44.971
Helen, the fever.

27:44.972 --> 27:45.939
If we wait for it
to break,

27:45.940 --> 27:46.973
she won't make it
through the night.

27:46.974 --> 27:48.742
Quickly, now.

27:48.743 --> 27:50.176
Stay with us, Imogene.

27:50.177 --> 27:52.145
We're going to
fight this.

27:53.748 --> 27:55.882
It's all right,
it's all right...

27:59.653 --> 28:01.287
It's all right.

28:05.593 --> 28:07.794
We battled until the very end.

28:07.795 --> 28:09.195
We tried everything.

28:10.297 --> 28:11.598
The loss of a daughter,

28:11.599 --> 28:14.267
it's a wound that never heals.

28:14.268 --> 28:16.069
I think he's handling it
differently

28:16.070 --> 28:18.304
than you.

28:18.305 --> 28:20.740
Do you believe
there are other reasons

28:20.741 --> 28:22.075
for his madness?

28:22.076 --> 28:25.912
His paranoid rage
stemming from...

28:25.913 --> 28:28.114
His belief that you tracked

28:28.115 --> 28:29.916
and murdered him.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.951
Are you asking
if we hunted him down?

28:33.187 --> 28:34.187
Yes.

28:34.188 --> 28:36.256
Absolutely we did.

28:36.257 --> 28:38.291
This comes from
the King himself?

28:38.292 --> 28:41.327
His majesty's orders
were quite specific.

28:41.328 --> 28:43.029
Well, Victoria
was wrong about him.

28:43.030 --> 28:45.031
Old Edward certainly does
have a backbone.

28:45.032 --> 28:49.169
Surely you must
have misheard.

28:49.170 --> 28:51.037
Sounds like we've
been hired for a job.

28:51.038 --> 28:52.272
Like a theatre troupe.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.007
Kill Worth

28:54.008 --> 28:55.275
just because
his lordship says so?

28:55.276 --> 28:58.244
He's not a lord,
he's a King.

28:58.245 --> 28:59.946
And, no. Go to hell,

28:59.947 --> 29:02.148
Mr. Prime minister.

29:02.149 --> 29:03.750
Seconded.

29:03.751 --> 29:05.652
Right, do it yourself,
you lazy squids.

29:05.653 --> 29:09.756
Indeed.
We are not assassins.

29:09.757 --> 29:11.357
Not for political gain,
at least.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.293
Darling.

29:13.294 --> 29:14.260
Pity.

29:14.261 --> 29:15.361
Undertaking this project

29:15.362 --> 29:16.596
would be in your
best interests.

29:16.597 --> 29:17.397
How do you
figure that?

29:19.033 --> 29:20.333
Let me be frank.

29:20.334 --> 29:24.070
Some of you are criminals.

29:24.071 --> 29:26.940
Mr. Druitt here
is very badly wanted

29:26.941 --> 29:28.741
down at Scotland Yard,

29:28.742 --> 29:32.312
and Mr. Tesla,
although a foreign national,

29:32.313 --> 29:34.114
is facing
several charges

29:34.115 --> 29:35.281
on illegal acts

29:35.282 --> 29:38.651
pertaining to the misuse
of electricity.

29:38.652 --> 29:40.153
My work is illegal?

29:40.154 --> 29:41.087
It needn't be,

29:41.088 --> 29:43.490
and much the same thing

29:43.491 --> 29:46.059
pertains to you,
Miss Magnus.

29:46.060 --> 29:47.961
<i>Doctor</i> Magnus...

29:49.663 --> 29:51.764
And I've committed
no crimes.

29:51.765 --> 29:53.299
Not exactly, no,

29:53.300 --> 29:55.668
but you do carry on
your father's work

29:55.669 --> 29:57.670
in the dark of night.

29:57.671 --> 30:00.206
The King could change
all that for you.

30:00.207 --> 30:02.108
Sorry...

30:02.109 --> 30:04.344
Are you bribing us?

30:04.345 --> 30:06.379
There are tremendous benefits

30:06.380 --> 30:08.748
in bringing
to an early conclusion

30:08.749 --> 30:10.283
this Worth affair.

30:10.284 --> 30:13.086
Benefits for
you all.

30:13.087 --> 30:16.322
A full and unofficial pardon,

30:16.323 --> 30:19.058
for you, Mr. Druitt,

30:19.059 --> 30:20.193
and the same

30:20.194 --> 30:23.897
for your indiscretions,
Mr. Griffin.

30:23.898 --> 30:27.033
Provided no more banks
are pilfered from, of course.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.102
Well, a man has to
make a living, doesn't he?

30:30.804 --> 30:35.708
And as for your endeavors,
doctors Watson and Magnus,

30:35.709 --> 30:37.877
full financial

30:37.878 --> 30:39.112
and governmental
support

30:39.113 --> 30:41.114
for your Sanctuary.

30:41.115 --> 30:43.216
Also unofficial,
naturally,

30:43.217 --> 30:46.052
but stalwart nevertheless.

30:46.053 --> 30:48.821
I'm sure you can see

30:48.822 --> 30:50.256
how your
all-important work

30:50.257 --> 30:52.859
would flourish under
our protective wing.

30:52.860 --> 30:54.160
And if Mr. Worth
does not come quietly?

30:54.161 --> 30:57.163
I'll leave you
to talk about all this

30:57.164 --> 30:58.565
amongst yourselves
at your leisure,

30:58.566 --> 31:01.868
although the King
would appreciate

31:01.869 --> 31:05.038
a firm answer
by tomorrow morning,

31:05.039 --> 31:07.640
please.

31:07.641 --> 31:09.209
Thank you
for your time.

31:12.379 --> 31:13.413
I shall convey

31:13.414 --> 31:16.749
your respects to the King.

31:34.301 --> 31:36.102
This way!

31:36.103 --> 31:37.704
<i> We decided to,</i>
<i>at the very least,</i>

31:37.705 --> 31:39.205
<i>apprehend Adam,</i>

31:39.206 --> 31:42.008
<i>stop him from harming</i>
<i>innocent people.</i>

31:44.278 --> 31:46.779
This is it.

31:48.716 --> 31:50.283
All right, gentlemen.

31:50.284 --> 31:52.118
<i>We believed we were acting</i>

31:52.119 --> 31:53.953
<i>not just in the best interest</i>
<i>of ourselves,</i>

31:53.954 --> 31:56.055
<i>but of the public as well.</i>

32:06.300 --> 32:10.737
<i>At first, we were right.</i>

32:10.738 --> 32:13.139
Bloody jackpot.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.307
<i>Cyanide,</i>

32:14.308 --> 32:15.642
<i>to be pumped through</i>

32:15.643 --> 32:16.776
<i>the city's massive network</i>
<i>of gas lines.</i>

32:16.777 --> 32:19.445
My God.

32:19.446 --> 32:21.281
Well done,
old boy.

32:21.282 --> 32:23.783
<i>We barely managed</i>
<i>to disable it in time.</i>

32:23.784 --> 32:26.152
<i>Adam, of course,</i>
<i>was long gone.</i>

32:26.153 --> 32:27.920
Had we failed,

32:27.921 --> 32:29.989
thousands, perhaps millions,
could have died.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.959
I'm guessing
it didn't end there.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.294
We were under
a tremendous amount of pressure,

32:34.295 --> 32:36.095
and he was still
very much a threat.

32:46.974 --> 32:48.141
How quaint,

32:48.142 --> 32:50.476
a woman with a firearm.

32:52.379 --> 32:54.213
You should have listened to me.

32:54.214 --> 32:55.381
It needn't have come to this.

32:55.382 --> 32:59.385
And yet, here we are.

32:59.386 --> 33:00.420
The others?

33:00.421 --> 33:01.487
Are close by.

33:01.488 --> 33:03.323
I love these alumni gatherings.

33:03.324 --> 33:06.793
Did you think
they would just ignore you?

33:06.794 --> 33:09.329
Let you spread
your chaos unchecked?

33:09.330 --> 33:10.997
You forced this action.

33:10.998 --> 33:13.299
You were wrong about me, Helen.

33:13.300 --> 33:14.500
You can't even
admit it now, can you?

33:14.501 --> 33:16.402
What did they do,

33:16.403 --> 33:17.937
promise you
the keys to the empire?

33:19.406 --> 33:20.840
It's over, Adam.

33:20.841 --> 33:23.109
There's something
you need to know, Helen,

33:23.110 --> 33:24.477
about this place.

33:29.383 --> 33:30.249
It's stupendous--

33:30.250 --> 33:31.851
Stop!

33:31.852 --> 33:33.119
I know what you're doing.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.987
More talk

33:34.988 --> 33:36.122
until he can save you
with his rage.

33:36.123 --> 33:37.423
Then what are you waiting for?

33:37.424 --> 33:39.158
I know
why you're here.

33:39.159 --> 33:40.827
What your task is.

33:40.828 --> 33:41.994
Go on, finish it.

33:43.897 --> 33:44.864
Finish it!

33:48.802 --> 33:49.836
Stay down!

33:50.971 --> 33:53.239
My second shot
won't be as kind.

33:55.008 --> 33:58.111
You've betrayed who you are.

33:58.112 --> 33:59.145
Who we are.

34:00.314 --> 34:02.348
We're not meant to serve.

34:02.349 --> 34:05.151
We're a different
breed.

34:05.152 --> 34:07.954
I could have shown you
so much.

34:07.955 --> 34:10.523
We could have learned
so much together.

34:12.359 --> 34:14.393
In the end,

34:14.395 --> 34:17.330
your only legacy will be
that you murdered me.

34:17.331 --> 34:19.031
Adam, don't!

34:19.032 --> 34:20.199
No!

34:23.804 --> 34:26.272
It came down
to a choice,

34:26.273 --> 34:28.306
one I deeply regret,

34:28.308 --> 34:32.445
and I've had to
live with ever since.

34:32.446 --> 34:37.116
When I took this job,
I had one condition--

34:37.117 --> 34:38.217
no secrets,

34:38.217 --> 34:40.786
and now I discover

34:40.788 --> 34:43.054
that this whole place

34:43.056 --> 34:44.357
was built on the blood
of a dead man?

34:44.358 --> 34:46.159
It was necessary.

34:46.159 --> 34:47.994
He has a psychiatric disorder!

34:47.995 --> 34:50.797
We didn't understand
the mind back then, will!

34:50.797 --> 34:52.098
We only knew he was a threat.

34:52.099 --> 34:54.900
To the public,
or to your work?

34:54.902 --> 34:56.402
How dare you?

34:56.402 --> 34:57.537
You've no idea wha--

35:00.974 --> 35:02.275
Hey...

35:04.077 --> 35:05.945
Magnus...

35:07.147 --> 35:09.282
Magnus,
wait a sec!

35:09.283 --> 35:10.183
Magnus...

35:10.184 --> 35:11.350
You know better

35:11.351 --> 35:13.152
than to follow an angry
woman out of a room.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.887
Just let her go.

35:14.888 --> 35:16.989
She's not exactly
herself right now.

35:16.990 --> 35:20.059
It's spread.

35:23.297 --> 35:25.531
Lymph nodes...Kidneys?

35:25.532 --> 35:28.201
Upper spine.

35:28.202 --> 35:29.869
She needs to see this.

35:29.870 --> 35:31.270
No, I don't think
you understand.

35:31.271 --> 35:32.472
With this much damage...

35:32.473 --> 35:34.207
We'll find a treatment.

35:34.208 --> 35:35.942
And if we don't,
she dies,

35:35.943 --> 35:37.109
Adam dies,

35:37.110 --> 35:38.277
we don't get
into the city,

35:38.278 --> 35:39.512
and all of its secrets
are lost--

35:39.513 --> 35:42.482
then that's
what happens.

35:42.483 --> 35:44.116
We deal with it.

35:44.117 --> 35:46.252
I don't think so.

36:05.873 --> 36:08.207
You should take better
care of yourself.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.409
You look like hell.

36:10.410 --> 36:11.677
How are you feeling?

36:11.678 --> 36:14.280
Not feeling
anything, really.

36:14.281 --> 36:17.083
Good thing, I'd say.

36:17.084 --> 36:18.851
John, I have to ask you--

36:18.852 --> 36:21.487
Yes...

36:21.488 --> 36:22.622
Adam.

36:22.623 --> 36:24.156
How is it possible?

36:24.157 --> 36:25.157
You said he was dead.

36:25.158 --> 36:27.860
He was,

36:27.861 --> 36:29.328
or so I thought.

36:29.329 --> 36:30.296
<i>Adam, don't!</i>

36:30.297 --> 36:31.397
No!

36:45.078 --> 36:46.345
John...

36:46.346 --> 36:48.447
End of the line,
old boy.

36:48.448 --> 36:52.118
They'll be coming
for you next.

36:52.119 --> 36:54.420
Maybe they'll let Helen
and Watson go free,

36:54.421 --> 36:55.488
but the ripper?

36:57.224 --> 36:58.891
They're going to
hunt you forever.

36:58.892 --> 37:00.059
She'll hunt you
forever.

37:00.060 --> 37:01.227
I hope she does.

37:01.228 --> 37:03.129
My safety deposit box.

37:03.130 --> 37:05.631
Bank account
in Kensington.

37:05.632 --> 37:08.134
The key's in my flat
in Marylebone,

37:08.135 --> 37:10.102
on the mantelpiece.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.404
What of it?

37:11.405 --> 37:13.306
Safe houses.

37:13.307 --> 37:14.574
Weapons, pass codes.

37:14.575 --> 37:15.942
Anything you need

37:15.943 --> 37:17.276
to help you
avoid capture,

37:17.277 --> 37:18.978
it's yours.

37:21.548 --> 37:23.549
I can't let you live, old boy.

37:23.550 --> 37:26.018
John...

37:26.019 --> 37:27.219
Let me die here like this.

37:27.220 --> 37:29.455
Please...

37:29.456 --> 37:32.091
Let me go.

37:40.567 --> 37:43.636
<i>He was close to death.</i>

37:43.637 --> 37:45.037
<i>I let him go with honor.</i>

37:45.038 --> 37:47.673
He was as good as his word.

37:47.674 --> 37:49.709
Everything I found
in his safe deposit box

37:49.710 --> 37:53.079
helped me avoid detection
for the next 80 years.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.548
His death gave us all a future.

37:55.549 --> 37:57.316
Mmm.

38:03.957 --> 38:06.459
I take it your boss
is feeling poorly.

38:06.460 --> 38:08.461
You've been
playing me.

38:08.462 --> 38:09.662
Buying time

38:09.663 --> 38:11.297
so her sickness
could take hold.

38:11.298 --> 38:13.432
You knew
she was dying too!

38:13.433 --> 38:15.434
One of the unfortunate
side effects

38:15.435 --> 38:18.437
of traveling through
an extra-dimensional rift.

38:18.438 --> 38:19.605
Even a small dose'll kill you

38:19.606 --> 38:21.607
eventually.

38:21.608 --> 38:23.342
No, no, come on, suicide?

38:23.343 --> 38:26.112
You've already
played that card.

38:26.113 --> 38:27.313
True, true.

38:27.314 --> 38:29.181
A good magician never performs

38:29.182 --> 38:30.182
the same trick twice--

38:33.954 --> 38:36.222
There's a cure.

38:36.223 --> 38:38.524
That's the only move
you have left.

38:38.525 --> 38:41.193
You are a smart one,
young concubine.

38:41.194 --> 38:43.663
Yes, there can be
a happy ending

38:43.664 --> 38:45.131
to all of this,

38:45.132 --> 38:47.533
and there is indeed a cure
for the radiation

38:47.534 --> 38:48.567
poisoning my body

38:48.568 --> 38:50.970
and hers.

38:50.971 --> 38:54.240
It's right underneath our feet.

38:56.109 --> 38:57.610
No...

38:57.611 --> 39:00.212
Oh, yes.

39:00.213 --> 39:04.717
If you want Helen to live,
we have to get to hollow earth.

39:18.089 --> 39:23.026
Helen...
We were so worried about you.

39:23.027 --> 39:27.197
By any chance, are we
coughing up blood yet?

39:27.198 --> 39:29.633
Good, yes.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.234
Suffering, check.

39:31.235 --> 39:33.670
You knew this would happen.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.372
You wanted me to follow
you into the rift.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.873
Ironic, isn't it?

39:36.874 --> 39:39.876
Enemies in life.
United in death.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.878
It's almost an opera.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.947
I don't believe your
story about the cure,

39:43.948 --> 39:45.349
not for a moment.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.184
We are fellow
scientists, yes?

39:47.185 --> 39:52.422
Ah, that's right,
you rejected me.

39:52.423 --> 39:53.757
Well, at least
you're consistent.

39:53.758 --> 39:56.293
If I die, you die.

39:56.294 --> 39:58.195
Yes, exactly.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.834
I know about the bargain
you struck with John.

40:05.436 --> 40:06.670
The river...

40:06.671 --> 40:08.772
How did you survive?

40:08.773 --> 40:12.409
And now we come to it.

40:14.712 --> 40:16.146
I can't let you live,
old boy.

40:16.147 --> 40:19.816
John...

40:19.817 --> 40:21.018
Let me die here
like this.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.019
Please...

40:22.020 --> 40:24.721
Let me go.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.910
<i>I was taken to the city,</i>

41:19.911 --> 41:22.179
<i>brought back</i>
<i>from the brink of death,</i>

41:22.180 --> 41:24.247
healed.

41:24.248 --> 41:26.817
They treated me as one of their own.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.152
Showed me things
you can't even imagine.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.454
Your longevity?

41:30.455 --> 41:32.823
Tip of the iceberg.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.958
It's the ultimate
toybox.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.194
Nirvana for the gifted.

41:38.396 --> 41:39.329
Intrigued?

41:41.365 --> 41:43.133
I don't blame you

41:43.134 --> 41:46.136
for anything, Helen.

41:48.206 --> 41:51.808
I want to help you, Adam,

41:51.809 --> 41:52.809
help us.

41:54.479 --> 41:56.313
Let me take us there.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.084
Show him
the map, Helen.

42:01.085 --> 42:03.086
And put all that
power in his hands?

42:03.087 --> 42:04.054
I'll handle Hyde

42:04.055 --> 42:05.522
one deranged killer
to another.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.023
It's too risky.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.525
We're back
to square one.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.360
Really?
We were so close.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.628
We'll find a way,

42:11.629 --> 42:13.530
but Adam Worth
is not getting that map,

42:13.531 --> 42:15.098
not on my watch.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.099
Oh, about that...

42:16.100 --> 42:17.501
Where have you been?

42:17.502 --> 42:19.369
Huh? In the library,

42:19.370 --> 42:21.104
boning up on
the Sanctuary charter.

42:21.105 --> 42:22.439
Helpful.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.373
Wait for it, Sonny.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.609
Apparently,

42:25.610 --> 42:27.043
if the Sanctuary head

42:27.044 --> 42:28.478
becomes physically or
psychologically compromised,

42:28.479 --> 42:31.381
the second in command
takes over.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.415
Dude, that is beyond cold.

42:32.416 --> 42:33.550
Nikola...

42:34.519 --> 42:36.219
Where are you going with this?

42:36.220 --> 42:37.220
Officially,
it's not your watch anymore,

42:37.221 --> 42:38.655
and the question

42:38.656 --> 42:41.057
of whether or not
we show Adam Worth the map

42:41.058 --> 42:44.294
is no longer
your decision.

42:44.295 --> 42:45.862
Over to you, William.

42:47.131 --> 42:51.134
What's it
going to be?
