[Male commentator]
2009 NFL season is underway.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.908
The Cleveland Browns
host the Miami Dolphins.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.510
Heisman Trophy winner
and first-round draft pick

00:42.610 --> 00:45.246
Bobby Coleman is
in as running back.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.714
Handoff, Coleman.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.517
Oh, and Coleman,
right off the bat, fumbles it...

00:49.617 --> 00:51.619
[Keisha] That's my dad,
Bobby Coleman.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.388
Not how anyone expected
his career to start.

00:54.488 --> 00:55.489
Might have been
his first fumble,

00:55.589 --> 00:58.058
but it wasn't his last.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.529
Because of that, I ended up
moving around...a lot.

01:01.629 --> 01:04.265
I turned six in Indianapolis.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.833
Eight was in Chicago.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.301
[Commentator]
Bobby Coleman coughs up the ball

01:07.401 --> 01:09.737
for the Bears, and
the Raiders recover.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.905
[Callie] Then we were on to
Jacksonville for my tenth,

01:12.005 --> 01:14.642
but you can probably
guess what happened.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.510
[Commentator] And then
the football comes loose.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.912
[Callie] The big 1-3
was in Minneapolis.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.481
I wasn't there long
enough to make friends,

01:20.581 --> 01:23.751
but I did perfect my
Madden skills.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.553
Twelve years after
that first fumble,

01:25.653 --> 01:27.521
we ended up in Atlanta.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.690
What I didn't know was,
I was about to have

01:29.790 --> 01:31.725
the weirdest year of my life.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.563
[Man on TV] As the Falcons
close out the preseason,

01:35.663 --> 01:38.599
the big question really is,
will Bobby Coleman--

01:38.699 --> 01:41.535
Keisha, why are
you watching that?

01:41.635 --> 01:44.272
Come on.
Don't listen to 'em.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.606
Listen to me.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.840
They don't know what
they're talking about.

01:46.940 --> 01:47.975
Well, I hope so,

01:48.075 --> 01:49.910
because we've already
moved so many times,

01:50.010 --> 01:51.145
and it's a lot!

01:51.245 --> 01:52.280
Look, I don't like picking up

01:52.380 --> 01:53.781
and shuffling to
a new city either.

01:53.881 --> 01:54.882
I know one thing--

01:54.982 --> 01:56.083
if Anderson Fisher
wasn't on the team,

01:56.184 --> 01:57.518
I'd definitely make the roster.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.886
No, you need to stop
worrying about everyone else

01:58.986 --> 02:01.489
and maybe start thinking about
what life might look like

02:01.589 --> 02:02.923
-after football.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.593
Did you just use those words
I think I heard you say?

02:05.693 --> 02:07.395
Coaches seen me put in
the work this preseason.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.829
Come on, baby.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.498
I've been killing myself
to be ready for this season,

02:10.598 --> 02:12.233
and you think I'm done.
But I'm just getting started.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.501
No, baby, that's
not what I said.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.769
But I can't take another trade.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.538
So that better be
look at this house,

02:17.638 --> 02:21.342
fall in love with it.
We can grow old here.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.110
-Okay.
-Okay.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.047
[Male commentator] Second
and twelve, versus Coleman.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.516
And back to the Lions.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.885
And he'll play four
at the 27-yard line.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.053
[snaps]
Whoa!

02:33.153 --> 02:36.557
Callie, jeez!
Not cool.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.691
Girl, that's my move.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.860
I saw you in the reflection.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.462
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.763
You really gotta
step up your game.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.432
-I guess so.
-[Callie] Yeah.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.600
-So no more cinnamon rolls.
-What do you mean?

02:46.700 --> 02:47.801
If you wanna make the roster,

02:47.901 --> 02:49.470
you gotta be at
peak physical condition.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.004
Oh, come on, Callie, it's
the last day of preseason!

02:51.104 --> 02:52.039
Uh-uh, no buts.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.507
Look, we've been
down this road before.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.209
First it's cinnamon rolls.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.610
Then late-night Cap'n Crunch.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.879
Then I find you hoarding
Oreos under the bathroom sink.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.981
Cookies taste so much
better when it's secret.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.750

03:04.117 --> 03:05.253
-[scoffs]
-I'm just saying!

03:05.353 --> 03:07.020
You sit in here all day
and you play video games.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.422
Am I wrong?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.123
No, that's why I have
a high OBR in Madden.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.925
You know what I was doing
when I was your age?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.094
[imitates old guy] Oh, when
I was your age, I used to...

03:14.194 --> 03:17.365
-go outside.
-[laughs]

03:17.465 --> 03:18.699
Just saying, it wouldn't
hurt to get out there

03:18.799 --> 03:21.235
and make a few friends.
You know?

03:21.335 --> 03:23.671
I know it hasn't been easy,
all this moving around.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.172
You mean it's not
every girl's dream

03:25.273 --> 03:26.507
to skip town every two years

03:26.607 --> 03:29.009
like her family's a bunch
of wanted bank robbers?

03:29.109 --> 03:30.811
-A fair hit.
-Mm-hmm.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.980
But I feel different
about Atlanta, baby girl.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.149
I'm telling you, I think
we gonna be here for a while.

03:36.250 --> 03:39.287
Yeah, I've heard
that one before.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.822
But it would be nice

03:41.922 --> 03:44.492
to finally
call a city home for once.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.230
-Guess what?
-Hmm?

03:50.331 --> 03:52.700
I couldn't agree more.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.304
I don't wanna keep being
the reason we move.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.005
Good.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.007
-Oh, can I show you something?
-Of course.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.377
Okay, so I've been working
on some predictive analytics

04:03.477 --> 04:05.112
to help prepare you
for your first game.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.348
Okay, I have no idea what that
is, but I love the sound of it.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.717
All right, so basically, it
all comes down to 0's and 1's.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.084
-Okay.
-I catalogued

04:11.184 --> 04:12.986
all the Falcons styles
from the past season.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.456
They're efficient, they get a 1.
Non-efficient, they get a 0.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.691
So I loaded that data
into this spreadsheet

04:17.791 --> 04:20.294
and coded an algorithm in
Python that can predict...

04:20.394 --> 04:23.263
-[laughs]
-What?

04:23.364 --> 04:26.467
Just--I'm just so proud of you.
You and your numbers.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.770
-You just keep getting smarter.
-Are you--are you listening?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.739
-Yes, Daughter, I'm listening.
-Okay, so...

I'm runnin' with it *

there's no limit *

04:44.552 --> 04:45.753
[Callie] ...pass to the
end zone.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.488
But oh my goodness!

04:47.588 --> 04:49.490
Last minute,
Coleman decides to lateral

04:49.590 --> 04:52.793
to All-Star Anderson Fisher!
Whoo!

04:52.893 --> 04:54.695
No, no, no, no,
whoo-ah, none of that.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.064
Time out. I'm not even
pretending to pass the ball to

04:57.164 --> 04:58.165
All-Star Anderson Fisher.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.867
And you, I see
you're trying to be slick.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.902
You're not about to drive, no.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.404
You only had your
license three weeks.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.939
I'm not trying to
have a panic attack.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.074
All right, fine.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.309
But I do get to play
my Spotify on the way.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.480
* Get it, get it

05:12.580 --> 05:13.847
* I got the card,
there's no limit *

05:13.947 --> 05:15.383
* In demand now,
going now by the minute *

05:15.483 --> 05:16.617
* Get it, get it

05:16.717 --> 05:18.652
* We get it, we get it

05:19.820 --> 05:22.289

we go, let's have some fun.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.225

would teach them a lesson.

remedial gym class, maybe?

05:43.411 --> 05:45.613
Here we go!
Here's the pitch!

05:47.648 --> 05:48.949
[Mean girls]
[laughter]

05:49.049 --> 05:50.751
[Mean girl] Put her
out of her misery!

05:50.851 --> 05:52.586
She's gonna break
home plate with her butt.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.321
[Gym teacher] Remember,
eye on the ball.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.989
Gonna get this.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.492
You're actually gonna try again?

05:58.592 --> 06:03.330
[screaming]

06:03.431 --> 06:06.366
[Gym teacher] No extra
charge for the cold showers!

06:06.467 --> 06:09.236
[Mean girls] [screaming]

06:10.471 --> 06:12.239
[Coach Evans] Bobby, you've
been a real workhorse for us

06:12.339 --> 06:14.408
this preseason.

06:14.508 --> 06:18.311
We've been impressed by
your hustle and determination.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.681
And that's why we wanna keep
you right here in the lineup.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.382
Yes! I knew it, Coach.

06:22.483 --> 06:26.219
-But on the practice squad.
-Okay.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.590
Listen, you're a hard worker
and a veteran leader,

06:29.690 --> 06:31.825
an ideal locker room guy for us.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.094
Right, right.
I mean, I love the locker room.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.029
And great water pressure
in the shower, by the way.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.130
I mean, wow.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.933
But just as an idea,
Coach, you know...

06:40.033 --> 06:42.636
wouldn't it be better if that
hard work and veteran leadership

06:42.736 --> 06:45.873
you speak about was being
used on the field, right?

06:45.973 --> 06:49.577
Out there, not...in there.
You know?

06:49.677 --> 06:51.078
All right, listen, Bobby.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.948
And, uh, don't take this
the wrong way, but...

06:55.048 --> 06:57.785
your Heisman days
are far behind you.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.953
And with the league
trending past firsts,

07:00.053 --> 07:02.422
we're just gonna keep
two backs active.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.492
So, we've got Allen,

07:04.592 --> 07:06.760
and obviously
Anderson's a no-brainer.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.562
Ha, ha!
Are you kidding me, Coach?

07:08.662 --> 07:10.330
I mean, the guy's a phenom.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.500
He is, he is.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.935
Well, thank you,
Coach, you know?

07:15.035 --> 07:16.537
For giving it to me
straight, you know?

07:16.637 --> 07:18.472
With no chaser.
I can appreciate that.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.907
I knew you'd take the news well.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.975
[sobs]

07:22.075 --> 07:26.379
Baby, I need you to
take a deep breath.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.416
I know it hurts, but
it's just temporary.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.684
And so what?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.085
Anderson Fisher
had one great year.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.154
It's not like it makes him
the face of the Falcons.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.793
[sobs]

07:39.893 --> 07:41.328
[Keisha] Baby, are
you gonna be okay?

07:41.428 --> 07:42.796
Yeah.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.131
'Cause I don't want
you crashing the car

07:44.231 --> 07:45.566
'cause you can't see the
road through your tears.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.867
[tapping on window]
Yo!

07:46.967 --> 07:49.903
Keish, I gotta go, okay?
I'll see ya.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.274
-Yo, yo, yo.
-Hey, Anderson, what's up, man?

07:54.374 --> 07:56.243
-You see that banner up there?
-Oh yeah.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.245
It's a big me!

07:58.345 --> 08:00.113
-Look how big I am, dog!
-I know, huh.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.515
[Anderson] Yo, you
know, maybe next time,

08:01.615 --> 08:03.817
I'll be posing for the
wax museum version of myself.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.519
What stance do you
think I should do?

08:05.619 --> 08:07.020
-That's cool.
-Hold up, hold up.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.889
-Yeah, that's cool.
-Are you all right?

08:08.989 --> 08:12.259
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:12.359 --> 08:15.362
Oh, man, there's just
allergies, you know?

08:15.462 --> 08:17.698
It must be pollinating the
whole parking lot, though.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.232
-What?
-Yeah, yeah.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.634
-Word.
-Yeah, word.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.336
-Who?
-You know...

08:23.436 --> 08:25.606
bees.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.207
-Bzzz?
-Bees.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.441
Bzzz.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.113
Right. Listen, man,

08:33.213 --> 08:34.948
crying ain't nothin'
to be ashamed of.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.585
Embrace your feelings.
You wanna hug it out?

08:37.685 --> 08:39.452
No.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.821
I'm a good hugger, right?

08:40.921 --> 08:42.022
-It's tight.
-Yeah--

08:42.122 --> 08:43.423
But it's not too
tight, all right?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.325
You can feel safe and secure
in these arms, I promise.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.327
I hear you.
Maybe next time, all right?

08:47.427 --> 08:48.428
-Done?
-Yep, that's it.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.897
I wanted to remind you about

08:49.997 --> 08:52.232
my end of preseason
party at my crib, right?

08:52.332 --> 08:54.334
You and the whole
family is invited.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.469
I want everyone to get the whole
Anderson Fisher experience.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.405
Well, I'm not too sure,
you know, what we got going on

08:58.505 --> 09:00.073
or whatever, but I'll
check with the wife.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.075
You don't wanna miss out
on these finger foods.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.944
Oh, you just gonna
roll that down, huh?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.647
I'm talking deconstructed
carnival fare, all right?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.215
-But listen, Sniffles.
-Hm?

09:08.315 --> 09:09.783
Go get some
24-hour relief, man.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.151
-Hey, cloud that up.
-Uh-huh.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.886
-Suck it up, dry it out.
-Yeah, dry it out.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.623
-[Anderson] You got it, baby.
-All right, man. Yeah.

09:15.723 --> 09:19.593
[music]

09:19.693 --> 09:22.830
Hey, new girl!
Wait up!

09:22.930 --> 09:25.766
It's Callie, right?

09:25.866 --> 09:29.703
Uh, yeah, that's
actually my name, yeah.

09:29.803 --> 09:33.473
I'm Kayla.
And this is Zoe and Margo.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.144
We just had to ask.
How did you pull that off?

09:37.244 --> 09:38.812
I didn't--
I didn't do anything.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.113
Right, right.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.649
Yeah, no, I'm gonna
need every single detail

09:41.749 --> 09:43.250
of what just what down.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.787
So, we were talking,
and we were wondering, um,

09:46.887 --> 09:49.422
if--if, you know--if--
it's up to you--

09:49.522 --> 09:51.124
If you feel like it would
be in your best interest--

09:51.224 --> 09:53.627
-We're on a robotics team.
-[Zoe] Yeah.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.929
Robotics?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.931
Like, you guys build robots?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.800
Yep! I'm team captain.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.202
We meet on Tuesdays
and Thursdays at 4:30.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.172
And based off of
what we saw today--

10:05.272 --> 10:09.142
that thing that you
definitely didn't do--

10:09.242 --> 10:14.414
well, whoever did do that
might wanna come check us out.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.416
Okay. Yeah, yeah, cool.

10:16.516 --> 10:20.453
I mean, um, whoever did
that would probably say

10:20.553 --> 10:24.491
thanks for the invite and,
uh, they'll think about it.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.526
Awesome, yeah. Thanks.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.996
[bell ringing]

10:31.999 --> 10:33.500
* Hey, hey, hey

10:33.600 --> 10:35.869
* Celebrate, every
day is a party *

10:35.969 --> 10:38.005
* Celebrate, every
day shake your body *

10:38.105 --> 10:40.240
* Celebrate, let 'em
wait in the lobby *

10:40.340 --> 10:42.976
* Celebrate, every
day is a party *

10:43.076 --> 10:44.978
* Yeah, we gonna celebrate

10:45.078 --> 10:47.280
* Keep it goin',
it's gonna be late *

10:47.380 --> 10:49.649
* Uh, we give the good energy

10:49.750 --> 10:52.019
* Hey, hey, hey, hey

10:52.119 --> 10:54.221
* Everybody got their hands up

10:54.321 --> 10:56.489
* Ain't no room on the
world for a dancer *

10:56.589 --> 10:58.658
* If they ain't here, go
ahead and call your fans up *

10:58.759 --> 11:01.094
* Then telegram to tell them
to bring a camera 'cause *

11:01.194 --> 11:03.163
* We about to burn it down

11:04.597 --> 11:05.833
Bobby Coleman!

11:05.933 --> 11:07.267
Hey, hey.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.171
What's up?
How are you doin'?

11:11.271 --> 11:13.206
Hey, you let me know if this
music too loud, all right?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.776
This must be Callie
and the beautiful Keisha.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.477
Cheeseburger on a stick?
Beef and cheddar

11:17.577 --> 11:19.980
tucked in a hash brown ball,
fried golden brown.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.182
-Sounds delicious.
-Yes, please.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.451
You see, they got good taste.

11:24.551 --> 11:27.187
Welcome to my wonderland!

11:27.287 --> 11:29.923
Custom built by the same
guy who did three of

11:30.023 --> 11:31.992
Robert Downey Jr's six houses.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.226
I have to show you
my home theater.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.494
Oh no, man,
we're cool right here.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.863
It just got installed.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.297
Guys in there playing
Madden right now.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.300
I should warn you, Callie,
she's mean on that Madden.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.235
-Takes no prisoners.
-Oh yeah?

11:42.335 --> 11:44.071
She must be playing as me.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.006
You know I got the
overall 100 rating, right?

11:46.106 --> 11:49.109
-You know, AF keep it 100!
-Yeah.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.611
Except nobody's got a
perfect 100 rating in Madden .

11:51.711 --> 11:53.480
Uh, Dad, he actually does.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.048
Yeah, they're saying
I'm the first one.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.984
You know, pioneer
and all of that.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.986
You know, create
milestones and all of that.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.320
Uh, what about you?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.022
What's, uh...
What's your rating?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.491
-72?
-He's a 67.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.525
[Anderson] Dang!

12:05.625 --> 12:08.361
I mean, that's tough.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.030
Well, you know,
at least on Madden,

12:10.130 --> 12:11.531
you're not stuck
in a locker room.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.767
You're actually on
the field with me.

12:13.867 --> 12:17.938
Behold, the home theater!
[laughs]

12:18.038 --> 12:20.841
Hey, yo, listen up!
This is Callie Coleman.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.243
She got next, all right?
Go easy on her.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.012
More like I'll go easy on them.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.380
[Guys] Whoa!

12:27.480 --> 12:29.116
Let me show you how
it works at the crib.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.351
So yeah, you know, the floors
are imported zebra wood.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.686
You look up, ceiling,
white marble.

12:33.787 --> 12:37.057
I said, whatever they gave
Michelangelo, give me that.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.525
That's me.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.029
It's a little
embarrassing, uh...

12:42.129 --> 12:43.263
So they made some
bobbleheads of me.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.866
I got a couple
advance copies.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.334
So yeah, that's
my knitting room.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.701
Uh, a lot of people
don't know this,

12:48.802 --> 12:51.138
but I'm actually really
good at making mittens.

12:51.238 --> 12:55.142
[water flowing]

12:55.242 --> 12:59.112
This is my rookie year
single-season rushing record.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.214
Had to put it somewhere.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.284
You know, Anderson, pride is
one of the seven deadly sins.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.320
Yeah, well, so is gluttony,
but that ain't stop you.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.889
[laughs] No, just
messing with you, man.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.757
It's probably 'cause
the shirt's small.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.425
You know, I'll be
honest with you.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.327
I actually thought
this rushing record

13:14.427 --> 13:16.263
was gonna be yours the
year you won the Heisman.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.530
-Word?
-Yeah, man.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.033
-You were my favorite player.
-Yeah?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.969
Yeah, don't doubt, man.
We all loved you.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.770
The whole fifth grade.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.073
Yo, let me get those
deconstructed cotton candies!

13:26.173 --> 13:27.707
-I'll get one too.
-[Anderson] Yo, hold up!

13:32.045 --> 13:33.646
[crowd cheering]

13:33.746 --> 13:34.882
[Callie] Whoo!

13:34.982 --> 13:36.616
I warned you I was
an expert in that.

13:36.716 --> 13:39.519
Did this girl invent the game?
How did you get this good?

13:39.619 --> 13:41.922
I think the real question
is how did you get so bad?

13:42.022 --> 13:44.057
[Group] Whoa!

13:44.157 --> 13:45.825
[Callie] It's all right.
Maybe next time, man.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.160
Everyone say bye!

13:47.260 --> 13:49.129
-[Group] Bye!
-Bye.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.563
Have a good one.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.969
All right, um, who's next?
Anybody else?

13:56.069 --> 13:58.105
-Uh, uh, all right.
-Yo, Anderson?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.739
I think it's only,
you know, fair

13:59.839 --> 14:02.442
that the man who owns
the home "the-a-ta"

14:02.542 --> 14:04.811
takes a turn.
What you say?

14:04.912 --> 14:08.248
[shouting]

14:08.348 --> 14:10.217
All right, cool, cool,
let's get it, let's get it.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.485
Let's see what
you got, Lil Coleman.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.756
* This is the beginnin'
of the new world, baby *

14:16.856 --> 14:19.326
[Group] Whoa!

14:20.260 --> 14:22.029
Get him, Callie!

14:22.129 --> 14:23.663
Button's stuck, man!

14:23.763 --> 14:24.898
* Superman did it

14:24.998 --> 14:26.166
* Passion of a G

14:26.266 --> 14:27.667
* Sittin' like a soldier

14:27.767 --> 14:31.304
[Group] [groaning]

14:32.572 --> 14:34.141
No, no, no, no!
I pressed--

14:34.241 --> 14:35.408
Hey, yo, come on.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.910
My control--
I was lagging, man.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.378
That's tough.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.247
Is it rude for me to
clown the host at the party?

14:40.347 --> 14:41.314
Or should I--

14:41.414 --> 14:42.849
[indistinct chatter]

14:42.950 --> 14:45.318
Hey. Are you gonna let her
fight all your battles or...

14:45.418 --> 14:46.853
you gonna come play me yourself?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.555
[chuckles]

14:50.257 --> 14:51.691
I got no problem with it.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.893
Long as you don't mind getting
beat by two Colemans in one day.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.965
[Group] [exclaiming]

14:58.065 --> 15:00.000
Okay, chill out,
chill out, chill out.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.768
You know what?
Since Bobby Coleman here

15:01.868 --> 15:04.004
has seniority, right?

15:04.104 --> 15:07.407
A lot of seniority.
He don't look old.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.243
I'ma let you play
as me, Anderson Fisher.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.811
Man, shut up.
I ain't gonna play as you.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.346
I'm gonna play as Bobby Coleman.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.315
And I'm gonna school ya.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.320
[thunder rumbling]
[rain hitting windshield]

15:22.755 --> 15:23.957
[Callie] [coughs]

15:24.057 --> 15:26.293
Hey, Dad.
You gotta admit.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.861
It's kind of funny
that you lost by 86 points.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.430
I mean, I've never seen it.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.199
Well, look, I-I
don't find the humor.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.601
And a man humiliated me
in front of all my peers.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.703
That was a direct attack
on my entire person.

15:36.803 --> 15:40.107
-Oh! Your entire person?
-Yes, Keisha.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.474
That was an attack
on my manhood.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.043
And I'm supposed to
just sit there and laugh

15:43.143 --> 15:44.144
like it's some kind of game?
Nuh-uh.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.547
It's literally a video game!

15:47.647 --> 15:49.782
Isn't that right,
Bobblehead Anderson?

15:49.882 --> 15:51.451
[imitating Anderson] Um,
that is correct, Keisha.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.520
Keisha, he gave you that
and you didn't burn it?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.555
Never say no to
a swag bag, baby.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.057
-Wait, wait!
-He's comin'.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.858
Uh, uh! Uh, uh!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.160
[Keisha] [laughs]

16:00.260 --> 16:02.062
You better get some
ice for this sore loser!

16:02.162 --> 16:03.296
[laughter]

16:03.396 --> 16:06.133
Poor guy's only a 67,
and mad.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.635
Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah, okay.
Just laugh, huh?

16:08.735 --> 16:10.837
-[Callie] [laughs]
-Oh, that's how it's gonna be.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.039
Hang you up.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.174
Make fun of Bobby.
Make fun.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.376
Bobby Coleman,
everybody laughing.

16:16.476 --> 16:20.047
-Don't, babe.
-Anderson is not so bad.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.182
He gave me a copy of his Madden .

16:22.282 --> 16:23.350
-He gave you what?
-[Callie] He signed it.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.152
And he signed it?
[stutters]

16:25.252 --> 16:27.354
But--no, stop!

16:27.454 --> 16:29.522
I'm not lookin' at the road.
I'm about to pull over.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.524
[Keisha] Give me the game.
Bobby, give me the game.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.693
[Bobby] Y'all
have gone crazy

16:33.793 --> 16:35.462
if you think I'm
bringing this to my house.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.864
This game is not
coming into my house!

16:37.964 --> 16:38.965
Throwing it out!

16:39.066 --> 16:42.235
[Callie] What? What?
No!

16:42.335 --> 16:44.204
-Wait, wait.
-Throwing it away.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.139
-Dad! Seriously?
-Yes, seriously!

16:46.239 --> 16:47.340
No, it's just a game!

16:47.440 --> 16:48.575
-No, it's more than a game.
-Stop!

16:48.675 --> 16:49.942
-What are you doing?
-What is wrong with you?

16:50.043 --> 16:52.279
-We were just joking!
-Don't you get it, Keish?

16:52.379 --> 16:54.481
That man has the life
we were supposed to have.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.050
Had I broken that rushing record
and gotten that big contract,

16:57.150 --> 16:58.285
that would be our house!

16:58.385 --> 16:59.586
No, but instead,
I've been dragging you

16:59.686 --> 17:02.289
all around the country for what?
Huh?

17:02.389 --> 17:04.224
Bobby's a big disappointment!
I'm a joke!

17:04.324 --> 17:06.059
I got no endorsement deals!

17:06.159 --> 17:07.760
I'm not even in
the conversation!

17:07.860 --> 17:09.229
It should've been us!

17:09.329 --> 17:11.364
[zapping]

17:11.464 --> 17:12.899
[Keisha] What the...

17:15.735 --> 17:17.337
Are y'all okay!?

17:17.437 --> 17:19.439
Callie! Callie, look at me!

17:20.307 --> 17:23.009
Am I, am I, am I, am I alive?

17:23.110 --> 17:24.111
I'm alive!

17:24.211 --> 17:26.479
-Can you hear me?
-Is she alive?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.281
You okay? You okay?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.617
Yeah, I'm actually--
I'm actually fine.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.486
Thank God. That was crazy!

17:33.586 --> 17:35.422
What is wrong with you two?

17:35.522 --> 17:36.889
We could be in the ER right now.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.958
Don't you have anything
to say to each other?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.460
Well, Bobby?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.395
-What? She started it!
-She started it!?

17:42.495 --> 17:46.466
Baby, you are a grown man.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.169
My bad for making fun of
your rating in Madden .

17:49.269 --> 17:51.304
I'm sorry.

17:51.404 --> 17:55.975
My bad for losing my temper.
I'm sorry.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.878
Well, I'm gonna have to
see a hug or something.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.083
Like, you mean it!

18:08.488 --> 18:13.726
[tender music]

18:13.826 --> 18:15.762
-Sorry.
-All right, let's get inside.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.133
Wait.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.070
Come on, baby,
it's raining so hard!

18:24.171 --> 18:25.638
Come on, let's go!

18:25.738 --> 18:27.907
[Callie] It's still perfect.

18:33.045 --> 18:36.449
[shouting]

18:39.386 --> 18:41.388
[grunting]

18:42.822 --> 18:44.123
Come on!

18:44.224 --> 18:45.658
Let's go!
Let's go!

18:48.161 --> 18:50.797
Whoo! Ha, ha, ha.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.098
[Man] All right,
Chris, one more time!

18:52.199 --> 18:53.800
Hey, man.
You know, at your age,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.702
it's not even about
finishing first.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.304
It's about finishing at all.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.539
We are all proud of you.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.874
You know, it's like watching
an old dog go up some stairs.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.243
Like, you don't
think he'll make it,

19:03.343 --> 19:04.777
but somehow the little
rascal digs deep?

19:04.877 --> 19:06.646
That's you, man!
You're digging deep!

19:06.746 --> 19:07.880
[Coach Evans] Starters!
You guys take a break.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.650
Practice squad,
let's run some formations.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.454
[sighs]

19:21.794 --> 19:23.863
[Madden] EA Sports--
It's in the game.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.367
[Crowd] Let's go, Madden!
[rhythmic clapping]

19:27.467 --> 19:30.203
[Crowd] Let's go, Madden!

19:30.303 --> 19:32.339
Let's get that rating up.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.974
[shouting]

19:35.074 --> 19:43.716
[music]

19:43.816 --> 19:46.018
* Got your best friend
hanging out the arm door *

19:46.118 --> 19:48.255
* You got game like I'm
droppin' me a console *

19:48.355 --> 19:50.523
* No, I don't swim,
but I give a long stroke *

19:50.623 --> 19:51.924
* Can I flex

19:52.024 --> 19:53.726
* While you're
giving me the best *

19:53.826 --> 19:55.662
* Get up in your gets
while I soak up my success *

19:55.762 --> 19:56.829
* Gettin' tokens
for your stress *

19:56.929 --> 19:58.431
* I'll be making
all the checks *

19:58.531 --> 20:00.600
* Any time you see me
step on the stage *

20:02.235 --> 20:04.237
-Woo!
-Yeah!

20:04.337 --> 20:05.572
Yeah, Bobby!

20:05.672 --> 20:07.507
Somebody ate their
Wheaties today, boy!

20:07.607 --> 20:08.675
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

20:08.775 --> 20:10.543
I like that!
I like that!

20:10.643 --> 20:11.844
I've never seen
him do that before.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.112
Never.

20:17.850 --> 20:21.153
* Everything has gotta be
cool when we livin' some fun *

20:21.254 --> 20:22.555
* Feel it in your bones

20:22.655 --> 20:25.224
* You ain't gonna
feel it 'til I'm done *

20:25.325 --> 20:27.727
* 'Caught up in your
feelin's like you're froze *

20:27.827 --> 20:30.763
* And everything around
you gettin' cold *

20:30.863 --> 20:32.632
[phone notification chime,
buzzing]

20:32.732 --> 20:34.734
* Caught up in my
feelings, now I'm froze *

20:34.834 --> 20:36.135
Yeah!

20:38.004 --> 20:42.208
Old dog teaching the young
pup new things out here today!

20:42.309 --> 20:44.811
-That's luck.
-Bobby?

20:44.911 --> 20:47.914
Let's have a chat in my office.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.081
Hey, yo.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.350
Yes sir, Coach!

20:50.450 --> 20:51.418
[knocking]

20:51.518 --> 20:53.320
Callie! Hey!

20:53.420 --> 20:57.156
We have been talking about
that sprinkler stunt non stop!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.458
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.393
Well, I mean, it
wasn't that impressive.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.028
Smart and humble.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.830
I'm gonna need you to be
a little cockier, though,

21:03.930 --> 21:06.766
like stand firm in your
power and abilities, yeah?

21:08.835 --> 21:11.438
That's Oliver.
He's a little reserved.

21:11.538 --> 21:14.741
Doesn't talk, really.

21:14.841 --> 21:18.244
More of a...supportive
head nod guy.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.480
Right, Oliver?

21:20.580 --> 21:21.814
I know, I know, sorry I'm late.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.017
I didn't--oh, whoa.
Hey.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.519
Hi.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.087
Look, sorry for running
into you and all that.

21:28.187 --> 21:29.689
-You good?
-Yeah.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.392
I'm Nate. Nathaniel.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.928
But you can just call me Nate.
Everybody else calls me that.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.163
Okay!

21:37.263 --> 21:39.599
So, Callie, you wanna see
our robot from last year?

21:39.699 --> 21:41.200
[Callie] Sure.

21:42.134 --> 21:46.105
[whirring, clunking]

21:48.741 --> 21:50.377
Definitely more
heart than function.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.744
Yeah.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.480
But now that we got
the LeBron of robotics,

21:53.580 --> 21:54.914
we goin' all the way.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.617
Yeah, that's, uh...
That's a lot of pressure.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.952
No, just all of our hopes
and dreams on our shoulders.

22:00.052 --> 22:03.155
[clicks tongue]
Light work.

22:03.255 --> 22:06.693
[phone ringing]

22:06.793 --> 22:09.161
Oh, um, I got to take this.
Sorry, guys.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.196
Yeah.

22:10.296 --> 22:11.631
Hey, Dad. What's up?

22:11.731 --> 22:13.533
Kind of busy with
school right now.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.402
[Dad] Well, come home.
We're celebrating!

22:15.502 --> 22:16.969
That's right, your daddy
got moved up to the roster.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.638
No more practice squad!
Ha, ha!

22:18.738 --> 22:21.474
Okay, I'll...
I'll see you soon.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.309
* Hey, feeling good

22:23.410 --> 22:25.678
So Rodney comes at me
from the right, babe, right?

22:25.778 --> 22:28.748
And I'm--I'm like, nope.
[laughs]

22:29.816 --> 22:32.552
So then I juke left,
kind of like this.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.654
Whoo! He don't have
a chance, right?

22:34.754 --> 22:36.055
So then I get it on--

22:36.155 --> 22:38.057
[clanking]

22:40.059 --> 22:43.195
Wait--I mean, you get the idea.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.397
Yes.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.865
You know what?

22:45.965 --> 22:47.434
I think the assistant coach
got some on the video.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.068
-So, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.539
So, how was robotics?

22:52.639 --> 22:54.907
Everybody seems to be
pretty cool so far.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.644
I mean, that's great!
No offense to your dad, but...

22:57.744 --> 22:59.278
you definitely get
your brains from me.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.480
Okay!

23:00.580 --> 23:03.315
Check it out!
Look at this, huh?

23:03.416 --> 23:05.418
-What!?
-How cool is that?

23:05.518 --> 23:07.286
-50-yard punt return.
-Oh, oh--

23:07.386 --> 23:09.956
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I gotta fast forward.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.725
-Look at that, huh?
-Oh my gosh!

23:12.825 --> 23:14.927
Dive and catch?

23:15.562 --> 23:16.829
[Both] [grunting]

23:16.929 --> 23:19.398
I'm so proud of you!
[laughs]

23:19.499 --> 23:20.800
[Bobby] Thank you.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.368
[Callie] I recorded my
game so I can show you how

23:22.469 --> 23:26.539
I'm improving your rating,
but...look at this.

23:26.639 --> 23:30.209
These plays are exactly the same
as what you did in practice.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.678
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.813
I mean, you know, it was better
in real life, though, because

23:33.913 --> 23:35.882
everything I did, you can
see Anderson Fisher's face.

23:35.982 --> 23:40.587
Every move I make,
he was like, wha?

23:40.687 --> 23:41.754
Jukin' left and right?

23:41.854 --> 23:43.823
Oh, baby girl, I can't sleep.

23:44.824 --> 23:47.460
Maybe the lightning somehow...

23:47.560 --> 23:50.763
No, no, no.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.132
I don't know.
It's just, like...

23:53.232 --> 23:55.234
real you was doing the exact
same thing fake you was doing

23:55.334 --> 23:57.770
at the same time
real you was doing it.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.972
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you mumbling about?

24:00.072 --> 24:04.844
I...I don't know.
No, that's insane!

24:04.944 --> 24:08.214
Video games can't
affect real life.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.282
Unless they can.

24:10.382 --> 24:12.051
Then it's like...

24:14.120 --> 24:15.655
Whoa.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.590
[laughs]

24:17.690 --> 24:19.025
I think we need to
run an experiment.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.693
-Say what?
-Your first game.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.629
What if I played
as you in Madden ?

24:22.729 --> 24:24.497
When that lightning hit,
it changed something.

24:24.597 --> 24:25.932
It changed your brain.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.167
No, Dad, let's just
see what happens.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.536
That's crazy.

24:29.636 --> 24:32.171
What's the harm in trying?

24:32.271 --> 24:38.244
[crowd cheering]

24:39.345 --> 24:41.147
* I don't swim, but I
give a long stroke *

24:41.247 --> 24:42.515
* Can I flex

24:42.615 --> 24:44.083
* While you get up in the rest

24:44.183 --> 24:46.018
* Get up in the gets
while I soak up my success *

24:46.118 --> 24:47.219
* Gettin' tokens
for your stress *

24:47.319 --> 24:48.855
* I'll be making
all the checks *

24:48.955 --> 24:50.590
* Any time you see me
step on the stage *

24:50.690 --> 24:52.792
It's the start of a new season

24:52.892 --> 24:56.028
with one sold-out
Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.898
And Tony, here we go.

24:58.998 --> 25:05.071
[crowd shouting, cheering]

25:16.015 --> 25:18.150
* Caught up in your
feelin's like you froze *

25:18.250 --> 25:20.386
* Everything around
you gettin'-- *

25:20.486 --> 25:22.388
[Tony] Well, on the
opening drive, Jim,

25:22.488 --> 25:25.692
look for the Falcons to
establish the run early today,

25:25.792 --> 25:27.059
especially with Anderson Fisher,

25:27.159 --> 25:29.328
who had a sensational
rookie season last year.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.964
It's a big story at
running back, no doubt, Tony.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.366
Anderson Fisher, the young star,

25:34.466 --> 25:37.069
looking to duplicate
his success from last year.

25:37.169 --> 25:40.272
And Taylor will start
out in the gun, here,

25:40.372 --> 25:41.874
and quickly some
pressure off the edge,

25:41.974 --> 25:43.710
and down he goes!

25:43.810 --> 25:45.211
[Tony] Taylor, oh my gosh!

25:45.311 --> 25:47.914
Well, that's a rough
start right there.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.816
Fisher, that's your assignment.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.584
And, you know,
he's only in the second year.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.953
Mistakes are gonna happen.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.824
[Jim] A mistake by Fisher.
And now it's second down.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.761
Twenty, hut!

26:01.861 --> 26:03.062
[Jim] And they
give it to Fisher.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.698
He finds a hole,
but coughs it up.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.100
And the Falcons recover,
but my goodness,

26:08.200 --> 26:11.137
what a tough start
for Anderson Fisher.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.139
[Tony] I agree with
Coach Evans here.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.074
To miss pass protection
on the first play

26:15.174 --> 26:16.843
and then fumble on the second?

26:16.943 --> 26:18.945
Here we go with the
veteran Bobby Coleman.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.713
[Jim] A bold move,
no doubt, Ton.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.281
A surprising move.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.818
So from the young buck to
the veteran, Coleman here.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.688
Third down for the Falcons.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.057
Bobby! Bobby,
you're on the wrong side!

26:31.157 --> 26:34.193
[Tony] Bobby's gotta
move over, Jim.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.928
Yeah, there ya go, Bobby.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.331
Ready in motion, motion!

26:40.332 --> 26:43.903
[Jim] And Taylor, he's gonna
go up top on third and long.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.071
He's looking.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.273
He has nobody down field open.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.541
He's gonna check
this down to Coleman.

26:49.642 --> 26:55.581
[music]

26:55.682 --> 26:57.283
[crowd cheering]

26:57.383 --> 27:00.286
[Jim] Coleman with a
nice little sidestep.

27:00.386 --> 27:03.589
I mean, look at the spin
move by Bobby Coleman.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.558
[Tony] Bobby Coleman
is making some moves--

27:06.659 --> 27:09.195
Ah! Oh, excuse me.
[laughs]

27:09.295 --> 27:10.663
[Tony] --college,
he was the guy.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.564
How happy is he right now, Jim?

27:12.665 --> 27:14.433
You gotta look at that.

27:14.533 --> 27:17.603
Bobby Coleman showing off
that Heisman Trophy.

27:17.704 --> 27:21.173
He's got great in...stincts.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.408
Instincts weren't great

27:22.508 --> 27:23.943
when you put a wall
in front of him.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.544
[Jim] Runs into the wall!

27:25.644 --> 27:26.713
No way!

27:26.813 --> 27:28.614
[Jim] He was so amped up.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.316
I was right!

27:30.416 --> 27:31.751
[Tony] This is
really impressive.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.085
I can't believe it worked.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.887
[Jim] Six to nothing, Atlanta.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.824
Bobby Coleman, his glory
days being reclaimed

27:37.924 --> 27:39.525
for a moment, here.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.060
Yeah!

27:41.160 --> 27:44.030
[Jim] He's been the
story so far today, Tony.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.198
He's going to reverse course.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.435
What is happening here?

27:51.137 --> 27:54.573
[Tony] If I'm
Anderson Fisher, I'm worried...

27:54.673 --> 27:57.710
[Jim] Another sidestep,
and there he goes!

27:57.810 --> 27:59.111
One more time, folks!

27:59.211 --> 28:02.481
Bobby Coleman, fourth
touchdown of the day.

28:03.415 --> 28:06.185
[crowd cheering]

28:06.285 --> 28:10.156
[Jim] Even blowing a kiss to
his wife, Keisha, in the crowd.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.124
The shovel pass, and guess who?

28:12.224 --> 28:13.860
Bobby Coleman one more time.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.528
And the Panthers'
defense is playing well.

28:16.628 --> 28:19.999
But Bobby and the Falcons
are playing better.

28:20.099 --> 28:23.302
It's off the charts!

28:23.402 --> 28:25.171
This time, Coleman
splits out wide.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.505
They throw it to him.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.474
He's got three
Panthers ahead of him.

28:28.574 --> 28:29.608
What's he doing?

28:29.708 --> 28:30.709
[Tony] He's going backwards.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.178
No! What are you doing?

28:32.278 --> 28:33.880
[Jim] Oh, look at
what he's doing.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.515
What a move!

28:36.615 --> 28:39.185
[Tony] He went backwards
to go forwards.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.320
Bobby Coleman is
having quite the day.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.190
[Jim] And with
touchdown number six,

28:44.290 --> 28:48.995
tied with Gale Sayers for
the most touchdowns ever scored

28:49.095 --> 28:50.396
in a single game.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.064
I don't even know
what else to say.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.699
[Tony] I can't say anything
about his performance.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.167
He scored six touchdowns...

28:55.267 --> 28:58.070
You were right, but...
This wasn't part of the plan.

28:59.705 --> 29:01.007
[Jim] Look at this.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.542
He's breaking it down
in all sorts of ways.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.744
[Tony] But this is
definitely gonna get a flag.

29:05.845 --> 29:09.148
[Jim] And that's gonna be a
15-yard penalty for taunting.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.450
But after all that
he's done in this game,

29:11.550 --> 29:13.986
I think the fans are gonna
give him a pass on this one.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.521
Hey, he's ahead of the game.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.990
[Jim] Joining him, his
wife's got it down too.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.827
[Tony] His family has
to be on cloud nine.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.228
It's inspirational, Jim.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.963
I mean, truly, this guy was on

29:24.063 --> 29:25.832
the practice squad
three days ago.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.566
Whoo!

29:27.666 --> 29:30.036
[All] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

29:30.136 --> 29:35.908
[music]

29:36.008 --> 29:40.646
[cheers and applause]

29:41.213 --> 29:43.549
Yeah! Yeah!

29:43.649 --> 29:46.718
That's how we play!
That's how we play!

29:46.819 --> 29:48.587
Great job today!
Great job today!

29:48.687 --> 29:50.156
Listen up! Listen up.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.657
I am so proud of you guys.

29:51.757 --> 29:54.526
You play like that, we gonna
win a lot of football games.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.695
[cheers and applause]

29:56.795 --> 29:59.398
Execution, determination,
everything we talk about

29:59.498 --> 30:01.067
-in dirty bird football.
-[laughter]

30:01.167 --> 30:02.568
Let me see that game ball.

30:02.668 --> 30:05.037
Speaking of that, today,

30:05.137 --> 30:08.107
a certain someone showed
he still got some wheels.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.341
[cheering]

30:09.441 --> 30:11.043
[Coach Evans]
And, and, and, and!

30:11.143 --> 30:12.511
Some questionable dance moves.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.980
[laughter]

30:14.080 --> 30:16.215
You know who I'm talking about.
Bobby Coleman, hell of a job!

30:16.315 --> 30:21.087
[cheers and applause]

30:22.688 --> 30:24.723
Thank you.

30:24.823 --> 30:29.328
[cheers and applause]

30:29.428 --> 30:32.664
[Players] Bobby! Bobby!
Bobby!

30:32.764 --> 30:40.472
[music]

30:40.572 --> 30:41.607
[Callie and Keisha]
[laughter]

30:41.707 --> 30:43.375
Those six touchdowns
gave me life.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.911
-Six!
-[Callie] Six!

30:45.011 --> 30:46.412
I still can't believe it!

30:46.512 --> 30:47.947
Oh, well you gotta
believe it, baby.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.249
See, 'cause Bobby Coleman is
turning back the clock, baby.

30:50.349 --> 30:53.019
-Hey!
-That's right, that's right.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.354
It just felt like, um...

30:55.454 --> 30:58.357
Like you were possessed
out there or something.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.426
-It kind of felt like that.
-[Callie] Yeah!

31:00.526 --> 31:01.627
It did.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.095
Just a vessel of some...

31:03.195 --> 31:06.232
greater power acting
through you.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.167
[Keisha] Oh, oh, oh, okay!

31:08.267 --> 31:09.768
[Callie] You might get
the life you always wanted.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.137
-Yeah!
-Yes!

31:11.237 --> 31:12.771
-Amen!
-Amen!

31:12.871 --> 31:15.807
-Amen!
-[Bobby] Amen!

31:15.908 --> 31:18.010
* Nah, nah, nah-nah, nah

31:18.110 --> 31:20.980
* Nah, nah, nah, nah

31:21.080 --> 31:23.282
* You think you can play me

31:23.382 --> 31:25.451
* You think you
can play me *

31:25.551 --> 31:28.854
* You ain't gotta come for me

31:29.922 --> 31:31.657
Okay, hold on, hold on.

31:31.757 --> 31:35.161
[shouting]

31:35.261 --> 31:37.263
* I got shooters
riding in Mercedes *

31:37.363 --> 31:39.831
-Bring it up, bring it up.
-Bring it up? Okay!

31:43.302 --> 31:45.337
[birds chirping]

31:45.437 --> 31:47.273
Okay, so in honor of
our brand-new season,

31:47.373 --> 31:50.809
I have a little
surprise for everyone.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.245
Homemade robot iPhone cases!

31:53.345 --> 31:56.848
And these originally
designed T-shirts.

31:56.949 --> 32:00.252
Each phone case has a robot
that matches your T-shirts.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.989
You know, to your
individual personalities.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.557
Go, PossumBots.
Aren't they perfect?

32:05.657 --> 32:09.128
I mean, it's a little
much, but I'll take it.

32:09.228 --> 32:10.462
That's what I like to hear.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.599
Yeah, I appreciate this.
This is--this is dope.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.201
But y'all, I got the
video all set up.

32:15.301 --> 32:16.702
Y'all ready to see what
we doin' this year?

32:16.802 --> 32:18.537
-Ooh, yes!
-Yeah.

32:19.605 --> 32:23.175
[Woman on video] Welcome to the
2022 First Robotics Competition.

32:23.275 --> 32:26.778
And this year's game?
Toxic Takedown.

32:26.878 --> 32:30.049
The Earth has been
overwhelmed by toxic waste.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.750
Using your removal droids,

32:31.850 --> 32:34.220
you'll collect
condensed toxic waste

32:34.320 --> 32:37.056
and launch it into
one of four depositories.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.191
The planet is counting on you!

32:39.291 --> 32:40.626
All right, guys.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.395
We should probably start
working on this right now.

32:43.495 --> 32:49.501
Or...we could procrastinate.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.703
* Let's go

32:51.803 --> 32:54.473
[cheering]

32:55.674 --> 32:57.576
* Put your hands up in the sky

32:57.676 --> 33:00.246
* Just keeping the dream alive

33:00.346 --> 33:04.683
[shouting]

33:04.783 --> 33:10.422
[music]

33:10.522 --> 33:11.957
[tires screeching]

33:12.058 --> 33:13.492
Oh!

33:15.727 --> 33:17.496
Whoa!

33:19.798 --> 33:20.999
Yo! You good?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.168
Whoa...

33:22.268 --> 33:23.369
That was wild.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.671
Yeah, I just got a
little distracted.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.073
Was it my face?

33:27.173 --> 33:29.208
Look, I keep meaning to tell
you not to be so distracted.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.009
Can you get over
yourself and help me out?

33:31.110 --> 33:32.544
All right, I got you.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.514
[Callie] I did not expect
these tacos to be so good.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.083
[Nate] Right? I've been here
for almost four years

33:37.183 --> 33:38.317
and I'm still not sick of them.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.786
My dad's in the military,
so we move around a lot.

33:40.886 --> 33:43.222
But good food always helps.
Mm-hmm.

33:43.322 --> 33:45.424
Four years is impressive.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.893
Yeah, the longest I ever
lived somewhere was three.

33:47.993 --> 33:49.128
But that was Jacksonville,

33:49.228 --> 33:53.732
so I was kind of happy my
dad got traded, so, yeah.

33:53.832 --> 33:58.237
But, um, hey, thanks for making
me feel like a part of the team.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.305
Hey, you're a great addition.

33:59.405 --> 34:02.074
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

34:02.174 --> 34:06.912
You know, my family has
always revolved around my dad.

34:07.012 --> 34:08.980
I mean, it's fine, but I
just never really experienced

34:09.081 --> 34:11.950
anything outside of that.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.386
So it just feels good to
be Callie Coleman for once

34:14.486 --> 34:16.322
and not just Bobby
Coleman's daughter.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.724
-You know what? I feel that.
-Yeah.

34:20.959 --> 34:23.629
[Jim] And Taylor
hands off to Coleman.

34:23.729 --> 34:26.732
And look at him zig-zagging
through the snow!

34:26.832 --> 34:30.169
[Tony] Is it me,
or is Bobby Coleman

34:30.269 --> 34:33.805
making yet another
unbelievable play?

34:33.905 --> 34:37.376
It's, uh, not perfect.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.345
But what are we thinking?

34:39.445 --> 34:42.114
That you're a genius! What?

34:42.214 --> 34:44.650
The structure is crazy!
We can do so much with that.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.718
Ooh, ooh, we can throw
the circuits in the back.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.521
And if we rotate
that arm, great launch.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.990
It's already, like, perfect.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.326
Guys...gold stickers!

34:54.426 --> 34:55.461
[laughter]

34:55.561 --> 34:56.828
Yes, Zoe, yeah.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.332
[Jim] Falcons on
the 2-yard line.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.834
And it's handed to Coleman.

35:02.934 --> 35:07.606
Oh! He flips over the top
like we've never seen before!

35:07.706 --> 35:08.840
Yeah!

35:08.940 --> 35:10.642
[Tony] I don't know
what radioactive spider

35:10.742 --> 35:12.511
bit Bobby Coleman, but this
is the fifth game in a row...

35:12.611 --> 35:14.913
Yes! My baby can fly.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.249
[yells]

35:17.349 --> 35:20.152
We got a good thing
going or what, huh?

35:20.252 --> 35:22.254
[laughs]

35:22.354 --> 35:24.490
* Watch the fam eat,
never starve *

35:24.590 --> 35:26.024
[Jim] Coleman,
just one hand,

35:26.124 --> 35:28.227
and he stops Garner.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.728
[whistle]

35:29.828 --> 35:31.363
Yeah! Whoo!

35:31.463 --> 35:33.965
[Jim] He's gonna bust
out the dance moves.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.801
[Tony] You can stay up
here if you want to, Jim,

35:35.901 --> 35:38.170
but I'm going to the
field to dance with

35:38.270 --> 35:39.805
Bobby Coleman and the Falcons.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.441
-Peri, head of PR.
-Nice to meet you, Peri.

35:42.541 --> 35:43.942
That was quite a game.

35:44.042 --> 35:46.545
I have never heard the
press room buzzing like this.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.946
-Buzzing for me?
-Mm-hmm.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.549
Hi, can I get
a chamomile tea, please?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.352
You're Bobby Coleman's wife,
right?

35:53.452 --> 35:55.621
-Yes.
-Girl, okay.

35:55.721 --> 35:58.524
It is on the house
for the whole season.

35:58.624 --> 36:03.028
-Are you serious?
-Yeah!

36:03.128 --> 36:05.931
Okay, okay!

36:06.031 --> 36:07.633
* Gotta elevate

36:07.733 --> 36:09.801
* No more looking back
'cause I stay in the game *

36:09.901 --> 36:12.938
* On to the next,
I don't see no contest *

36:13.038 --> 36:14.072
[cheering]

36:14.172 --> 36:16.475
Last bit of business.
What do we call it?

36:16.575 --> 36:19.511
SpongeBot SpareParts.

36:19.611 --> 36:20.646
-That was dope.
-I like that.

36:20.746 --> 36:22.314
-Yeah?
-Let's do it!

36:22.414 --> 36:25.050
* No more looking back
'cause I stay in the game *

36:28.053 --> 36:29.755
I got big news! Big news!

36:29.855 --> 36:31.357
Coach just told me
I'm starting next game.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.792
Not Anderson, me.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.727
It's been 10 years
since I've started.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.497
Mm! A small knock
might've been nice.

36:38.597 --> 36:43.502
Hey, it's all happening!
It's all happening. [laughs]

36:43.602 --> 36:45.304
And--and this game is
the most important so far,

36:45.404 --> 36:48.940
so I need you to make sure I'm
at my absolute best this Sunday.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.910
-Wait, this--this Sunday?
-[laughs]

36:52.010 --> 36:54.380
Wait, you got somewhere
more important to be?

36:54.480 --> 36:56.948
Yeah, the robotics regionals.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.817
Can't you just scoot
away, you know,

36:58.917 --> 37:03.322
when you're not doing your thing
so you can do our thing, huh?

37:03.422 --> 37:05.691
The thing that's got me
starting

37:05.791 --> 37:09.561
over Anderson Fisher.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.930
[Callie] Maybe.

37:12.030 --> 37:17.135
Callie, I-I need you.
Your dad needs you.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.970
-I need you.
-[chuckles]

37:19.070 --> 37:20.972
[text whoosh]

37:21.072 --> 37:22.574
Yeah. Of course.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.176
I'm--I'm sure I can manage.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.245
-That's my girl.
-Mm-hmm.

37:27.346 --> 37:30.048
[laughs] Yes!

Get in the game.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.803
[indistinct chatter]

38:24.903 --> 38:26.838
Sorry.
Just doing a little recon.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.474
-Yes!

38:28.574 --> 38:30.542
You guys are up!

-[Margo] Let's do this!

38:32.277 --> 38:33.712

* All I do is win, win,
win, no matter what *

38:35.714 --> 38:39.150
* Got money on my mind,
I can never get enough *

38:40.586 --> 38:41.687
There you go.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.155
* Everybody hands go up

38:45.223 --> 38:46.992
[Man] You know what they
say about great players.

38:47.092 --> 38:51.563
The more personal you are,
the more valuable you are.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.099
[Jim] And he's all
alone down the sideline.

38:54.199 --> 38:58.937
And he leaps in for good
measure for the touchdown!

38:59.037 --> 39:02.273
[whirring]

39:03.274 --> 39:05.944
[cheering]

39:06.712 --> 39:08.747
[Tony] And Coleman
comes back just in time

39:08.847 --> 39:10.816
to make an incredibly
difficult play.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.951
[Jim] This is quite
the balancing act.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.187
Whoo!

39:16.287 --> 39:21.359
[music]

39:21.460 --> 39:23.228
Stop!

39:23.328 --> 39:24.896
Someone just threw up

39:24.996 --> 39:27.966
all the way at the other
end of the building,

39:28.066 --> 39:31.269
and it's just so,
so far from here.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.771

* All I do is win, win,
win, no matter what *

39:35.206 --> 39:37.843
[Jim] And now Coleman,
it's like he's frozen in time.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.878
[Tony] Multitasking
is important.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.680
Trying to figure out
exactly which way to go?

39:41.780 --> 39:43.048
Also important.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.016
[Jim] Look at that.
Focus regained.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.419
And now he just heads
straight to the sideline.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.421
Crisis narrowly averted.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.356
[Tony] Despite defenders
coming from every direction,

39:51.457 --> 39:56.094
Coleman bobs and weaves,
somehow finding a clear path.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.998
-Hey.
-Were you just in the closet?

40:00.098 --> 40:02.734
No. No, no.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.438
What's going on?

40:08.373 --> 40:09.374
Is something wrong?

40:09.475 --> 40:12.911
'Cause you know you can tell me.

40:16.782 --> 40:19.050
I'm good.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.185
Mom, I'm fine.

40:20.285 --> 40:23.722
I'm just a little
stressed with the, um...

40:23.822 --> 40:25.190
the robot stuff.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.559
It's crazy in there.
But I gotta get back in there.

knowing your teammate's
on track to break

41:24.816 --> 41:26.585
your single-season
rushing record?

41:26.685 --> 41:30.121
I mean, gotta be
some mixed emotions.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.792
Whatever gets the
team a win, right?

41:33.892 --> 41:35.927
But, uh, I would like to
know how he's doing it.

41:36.027 --> 41:37.629
Anybody wanna know?

41:37.729 --> 41:39.364

don't know, a ripple

How are you doing it, my boy?

41:48.039 --> 41:50.876
[Woman] Come on, Bobby,
what's your secret?

41:50.976 --> 41:53.111
I'd have to say, honestly,
the support of my family.

41:53.211 --> 41:54.846
Those two ladies right
there in the back?

41:54.946 --> 41:56.147
They just started
supporting you, huh?

41:56.247 --> 41:57.415
Yeah. Huh?

41:57.515 --> 41:59.651
How are you guys feeling
about Bobby's season so far?

41:59.751 --> 42:03.488
Oh, we are just so
very proud of him.

42:03.589 --> 42:05.557
-Right, Callie.
-Yeah.

42:05.657 --> 42:07.025
Yeah, I mean, totally.

42:07.125 --> 42:10.495
I mean, we're sort of like
our own team, you know?

42:10.596 --> 42:13.999
We feel like we're a very
big part of his success.

42:14.099 --> 42:17.368
Like, a very big part.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.138

42:20.238 --> 42:21.607
She's not wrong.

42:21.707 --> 42:23.609
Uh, I couldn't do
it without her.

42:23.709 --> 42:25.410
Without them, I mean.

42:25.510 --> 42:26.878
He really couldn't.

42:26.978 --> 42:28.213
Real cute family moment, right?

42:28.313 --> 42:29.881
Let's get back to
the football questions.

42:29.981 --> 42:32.684
Well actually,
given how supportive

42:32.784 --> 42:34.052
your daughter has been,

42:34.152 --> 42:36.521
don't you think she
deserves her own car?

42:36.622 --> 42:39.024
Or at the very least,
is able to borrow yours

42:39.124 --> 42:41.426
so she can hang out
with her friends?

42:41.526 --> 42:42.794
What do you say, Bobby?

42:42.894 --> 42:45.196
I say, you know, we can
talk about it at home.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.231
Right, Callie?

42:46.331 --> 42:48.266

answers, Coleman!

Five, four, three...

42:56.307 --> 42:58.509

in the Coleman household?

42:58.610 --> 43:00.511
-I would say busy.
-Yeah, busy.

43:05.216 --> 43:06.785

43:06.885 --> 43:08.687
Gotta get that player rating up
because, it's--it's way too low.

[Callie] Yeah,
we're working on it.

43:10.622 --> 43:13.424

she's working on it.

43:13.524 --> 43:14.993
Working on it.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.762
Does that mean he's working
on that new car for you?

43:16.862 --> 43:18.096
Oh no, Burleson,
you're killing me.

All right, man, what's up, huh?

47:47.498 --> 47:49.467
'Cause you creepin' me out.

47:49.567 --> 47:50.801
Look.

47:50.902 --> 47:53.238
I'ma level with you.

47:53.338 --> 47:57.108
I don't get a guy your age,
with your history,

47:57.208 --> 47:59.844
can just elevate his game
like that in one night.

48:02.580 --> 48:04.049
I know I'm better than you.

48:04.149 --> 48:05.984
Is it that hard to believe?

48:06.084 --> 48:07.518
Yeah.

48:07.618 --> 48:10.455
Look, I don't know
how you're doin' it,

48:10.555 --> 48:13.291
but I know it's not normal.

48:15.393 --> 48:16.894
What's your secret?

48:20.331 --> 48:21.399
Nate! Thanks for coming

48:21.499 --> 48:23.101
and helping
with the robotics arm.

48:23.201 --> 48:24.435
I've been really busy.

48:24.535 --> 48:25.736
You know, we're
a little behind, so...

48:25.836 --> 48:27.238
Yeah.

48:27.338 --> 48:28.906
I brought some tacos.

48:29.007 --> 48:31.342
I can't wait to see
your arm design.

48:31.442 --> 48:35.280
Uh, so this is my room.

48:35.380 --> 48:37.882
So, okay, um, I haven't
made a lot of progress,

48:37.983 --> 48:40.118
but I can just show you
some of the basic schematics.

48:40.218 --> 48:41.686
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

48:41.786 --> 48:43.221
You got Madden ?

48:43.321 --> 48:45.123
And it's signed by
Anderson Fisher!

48:45.223 --> 48:46.357
You don't--you
don't play Madden .

48:46.457 --> 48:47.959
Oh, okay, you haven't heard?

48:48.059 --> 48:50.261
Girls play video games too,
so...

48:50.361 --> 48:51.696
-Oh, is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

48:51.796 --> 48:53.064
Change of plans.

48:53.164 --> 48:54.699
I think we should
get a warm-up game in

48:54.799 --> 48:56.567
before we dive into
the schematics.

48:56.667 --> 49:00.405
And if I lose--if I lose--
we play some games.

49:00.505 --> 49:01.806
Guess we playin'
two games, then.

49:01.906 --> 49:02.840
Oh, is that right?

49:02.940 --> 49:04.175
-Uh-huh.
-Okay, gotcha.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.644
You know, it's a mix
of the agility training

49:06.744 --> 49:08.846
meets the mindfulness
exercises, all right?

49:08.946 --> 49:09.814
Over and over.

49:09.914 --> 49:11.949
And, um...
[snaps]

49:12.050 --> 49:13.985
Dietary changes.

49:14.085 --> 49:15.286
What dietary changes?

49:15.386 --> 49:20.291
Um...special
high-performance smoothie.

49:20.391 --> 49:22.727
-A high-performance smoothie?
-Yeah.

49:22.827 --> 49:24.162
Listen, I gotta rock.

49:24.262 --> 49:26.497
Sensei says I should, you know,
meditate every three hours.

49:26.597 --> 49:28.866
And, so, let me
just get on out of here.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.835
You know what?

49:30.935 --> 49:34.372
I could really use one of those
high-performance smoothies.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.907
How 'bout you make one?
Right now.

49:37.008 --> 49:38.843
[Callie]
Whoo! [laughs]

49:38.943 --> 49:40.745
Okay, um, wait, remind me.

49:40.845 --> 49:44.015
In football, more points
are better, right?

49:44.115 --> 49:45.516
You know, let's go through the
tutorial real quick.

49:45.616 --> 49:46.984
Like, really teach
you how to play.

49:47.085 --> 49:48.219
Oh, you a savage, huh?

49:48.319 --> 49:49.520
You know I let you
win this one, right?

49:49.620 --> 49:51.022
-Oh, for real?
-I had to.

49:51.122 --> 49:52.390
You can't--okay.
Whatever.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.724
How come you don't
play as your dad?

49:53.824 --> 49:55.026
He's hot right now.

49:55.126 --> 49:56.594
It's like he's having
a second coming or something.

49:56.694 --> 49:58.796
Well, I only play him
for actual games.

49:58.896 --> 50:01.632
-What?
-[gulps]

50:01.732 --> 50:03.368
Um...

50:03.468 --> 50:04.802
[laughs nervously]

50:04.902 --> 50:08.606
Um, well, what I mean is
when I'm not there with him,

50:08.706 --> 50:10.941
like with my family, I, um...

50:11.042 --> 50:15.080
I play him in Madden to
make it feel like I'm there.

50:15.180 --> 50:16.747
Yeah, yeah, like, um...

50:16.847 --> 50:19.250
We call it
virtual bonding, so, yeah.

50:19.350 --> 50:21.419
How about I just
grab us some sodas?

50:21.519 --> 50:22.987
That seems accurate, yeah.
I will be right back.

50:23.088 --> 50:25.856
I'm not--I'm not...thirsty.

50:28.093 --> 50:29.327
Okay.

50:34.732 --> 50:36.033
Ah, okay.

50:36.134 --> 50:37.435
Really need your
blueberries, right?

50:37.535 --> 50:39.237
Need your antioxidants.

50:39.337 --> 50:40.705
Then you get your strawberries.

50:40.805 --> 50:43.841
Get it all in there.
Yep, everything, that's it.

50:43.941 --> 50:46.010
Yeah, right there.

50:46.111 --> 50:47.445
Banana in.

50:49.314 --> 50:50.781
Whole thing.
With the peel on.

50:50.881 --> 50:51.782
With the peel?

50:51.882 --> 50:53.184
A little oatmeal
never hurt anybody.

50:53.284 --> 50:54.885
Two scoops.

50:55.386 --> 50:56.854
Or more.

50:59.290 --> 51:01.359
Aah!

51:01.459 --> 51:04.395
Yo! Fallen
and you can't get up?

51:04.495 --> 51:07.832
I just fumbled the spoon.
I'm old, G.

51:07.932 --> 51:15.640
[music]

51:20.145 --> 51:21.179
[laughs]

51:21.279 --> 51:22.680
Yes, yes.

51:22.780 --> 51:26.717
The key is, uh,
the milk, right?

51:26.817 --> 51:27.685
You know?

51:27.785 --> 51:30.888
But never from a cow.
[laughs]

51:30.988 --> 51:33.691
Only oat or goat--
it won't make you bloat.

51:36.794 --> 51:39.930
I gotta say, man, sound like
a normal old smoothie to me.

51:40.030 --> 51:42.567
I don't like the hair,
so let's put a fro on him.

51:46.371 --> 51:47.738
[Anderson] Yo, I'm
gonna be your age

51:47.838 --> 51:49.674
by the time you're finished
making this smoothie, man.

51:53.878 --> 51:55.213
Yo! Can I help?

51:55.313 --> 51:57.282
[Bobby] I'm good.
I'm all good.

51:57.382 --> 52:06.424
[music]

52:10.261 --> 52:11.729
[Nate] [laughs] Yeah.

52:15.566 --> 52:17.568
Put some blond hair on him.

52:18.769 --> 52:20.605
[groans]

52:24.041 --> 52:25.142
[gasps]

52:25.243 --> 52:26.277
[Anderson] Yo, can I help?

52:26.377 --> 52:28.346
[Bobby] No, just
keep shooting pool.

52:28.446 --> 52:30.281
Don't move at all.

52:30.381 --> 52:35.453
[music]

52:35.553 --> 52:39.624
The real secret is
all about the fertilizer.

52:39.724 --> 52:42.960
You gotta fertilize yourself.

52:43.060 --> 52:44.629
Nasty.

52:44.729 --> 52:47.932
All right, now we'll add
some junk to that trunk.

52:48.032 --> 52:50.000
[screams]

52:51.035 --> 52:52.537
I'm coming back there.

52:52.637 --> 52:55.240
Why? Why? [sobs]

52:55.340 --> 52:56.541
That's how he should look.

52:56.641 --> 52:58.776
That's exactly how
he should look.

52:58.876 --> 53:01.779
What are you doing?
That's my dad!

53:02.380 --> 53:04.482
Whoa, relax.

53:04.582 --> 53:05.850
You know, I thought
it was funny.

53:05.950 --> 53:07.618
Well, it's not!

53:11.489 --> 53:13.090
I got my butt back!

53:13.190 --> 53:15.192
What?

53:15.293 --> 53:16.827
Oh, it's a Gen-Z thing.

53:16.927 --> 53:18.563
It's kind of like,
you know, I figured it out.

53:18.663 --> 53:20.365
I got my butt back!
[laughs]

53:20.465 --> 53:21.399
[Callie] What did you do?

53:21.499 --> 53:23.000
What else did you change?

53:23.100 --> 53:26.637
Look, you know what?
I think I'll just head out.

53:26.737 --> 53:29.139
I didn't you'd get so upset
over a little video game.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.876
Wait, Nate, Nate, look. Um...

53:31.976 --> 53:37.047
Okay, so you may not know,
but the game,

53:37.147 --> 53:38.616
it's, um, uh...

53:38.716 --> 53:41.151
It's...
It's, um...

53:41.252 --> 53:42.687
-Well, I...
-You know what?

53:42.787 --> 53:44.789
I'll just see you at school.

53:47.325 --> 53:49.560
[sighs]

53:52.697 --> 53:54.765
That's great.

53:55.700 --> 53:59.304
[phone ringing, vibrating]

53:59.404 --> 54:00.738
It's the hospital.
I gotta take this.

54:00.838 --> 54:03.608
But don't move.
I made brownies to eat.

54:05.075 --> 54:06.777
Hey, what's up?

54:08.479 --> 54:09.547
Wanna tell me what
happened to me today?

54:09.647 --> 54:11.248
It was my friend.

54:11.349 --> 54:13.318
I shouldn't have left him
alone with the game, all right?

54:13.418 --> 54:15.786
All right, look, Anderson was
real suspicious of me today.

54:15.886 --> 54:16.987
Okay? He could ruin
everything for me.

54:17.087 --> 54:19.690
You can't be so careless.
You know?

54:19.790 --> 54:21.526
Especially not when I'm about
to beat his rushing record

54:21.626 --> 54:22.927
and we're about to
make the playoffs.

54:23.027 --> 54:24.895
I know. I know.

54:27.064 --> 54:29.133
All right.

54:29.967 --> 54:31.669
But also, I was thinking...

54:32.770 --> 54:36.073
Maybe we should chill on
the whole Madden thing.

54:36.173 --> 54:37.542
What do you mean the
whole Madden thing?

54:37.642 --> 54:38.643
What are you talking about?

54:38.743 --> 54:39.944
I just think it's
too much right now.

54:40.044 --> 54:41.646
And with nationals
and everything, I...

54:41.746 --> 54:44.214
I think I need to
focus on robotics.

54:44.315 --> 54:48.252
Callie, robotics?
I got a shot at the Super Bowl.

54:48.353 --> 54:52.156
You know what that means?
That means a bigger house.

54:52.256 --> 54:53.691
A nice pool. A shed.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.159
We can build a
whole shed for you to do

54:55.259 --> 54:58.463
all the robot building
you could ever wanna do.

54:58.563 --> 55:00.631
It's great news for all of us.

55:00.731 --> 55:05.169
Hey, check it out. Look.

55:05.269 --> 55:06.837
Your dad's on TV again!

55:06.937 --> 55:09.340
Everybody keeps asking
me what my secret is.

55:09.440 --> 55:10.808
There's no secret. [laughs]

55:10.908 --> 55:13.210
What's up, big man?
That's it! Hard work!

55:13.310 --> 55:14.412
My hard work!

55:14.512 --> 55:16.013
That's all there is to it!

55:16.113 --> 55:19.149
You tell 'em, Bobby Coleman.
That's what I told them.

55:19.249 --> 55:21.952
That's my secret. [laughs]

55:22.052 --> 55:24.789
Can we--can we at
least tell Mom?

55:24.889 --> 55:26.557
She almost caught me while
I was juggling helping you

55:26.657 --> 55:28.092
and trying to win regionals.

55:28.192 --> 55:30.428
I'm sure your mama didn't
think twice about it, Callie.

55:30.528 --> 55:33.030
-You know your mother.
-[sighs]

55:33.130 --> 55:35.800
-[Bobby] What's the problem?
-I'm starting to feel guilty.

55:35.900 --> 55:37.968
I mean, look at us.
We're lying.

55:38.068 --> 55:41.839
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Hey. Come on, now.

55:41.939 --> 55:43.974
I'm having a moment in my life.
We all are!

55:44.074 --> 55:46.477
And for once, hey,
baby girl, for once,

55:46.577 --> 55:50.981
I'm finally living up
to that thing, huh?

55:51.081 --> 55:52.617
So let's not go
rock the boat now.

55:52.717 --> 55:54.419
No, no, no, Just keep
doing what you're doing,

55:54.519 --> 55:55.853
and you're doing it great.

55:55.953 --> 55:58.589
Everything will be
just fine, okay?

55:58.689 --> 56:00.725
Okay.

56:00.825 --> 56:02.092
Easy for you.
I'm the one doing it.

56:02.192 --> 56:03.861
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, hey, Callie,

56:03.961 --> 56:06.063
I'm actually on the field
getting the job done.

56:06.163 --> 56:08.399
You're just pressing
some buttons a little.

56:09.934 --> 56:11.836
Just pressing some buttons?
A little?

56:11.936 --> 56:13.137
[phone buzzing,
notification chime]

56:13.237 --> 56:14.304
[Bobby] Babe!

56:14.405 --> 56:19.309
I just hit a million followers!
Ha! [laughs]

56:21.412 --> 56:23.347
[music]

56:23.448 --> 56:25.850
The Las Vegas Raiders
have made the trek east

56:25.950 --> 56:28.118
to take on the Atlanta Falcons

56:28.218 --> 56:30.821
in a game that is
pivotal for each side

56:30.921 --> 56:34.659
and just huge for the
Falcons' playoff chances.

56:34.759 --> 56:36.226
[Tony] Well, they're
going up against

56:36.326 --> 56:37.828
one of the teams that people
recognize around football

56:37.928 --> 56:40.531
as one of the toughest
teams in the league.

56:40.631 --> 56:43.333
So we'll see how
good the Falcons are.

56:43.434 --> 56:45.870
[Jim] And the Falcons get the
job done on their home turf

56:45.970 --> 56:48.005
at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

56:48.105 --> 56:49.640
They know they have
to get this one.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.008
Can they do it?

56:51.108 --> 56:53.744
Taylor hands off to
Coleman, who--whoa!

56:53.844 --> 56:55.546
What is he doing?

56:55.646 --> 56:57.247
What is circling
inside of his head?

56:57.347 --> 56:58.549
What is going on?

56:58.649 --> 56:59.850
[Tony] That's a
great question, Jim.

56:59.950 --> 57:01.151
We're all actually
asking that because

57:01.251 --> 57:02.687
Coleman is just running
around in circles.

57:02.787 --> 57:03.821
Stop messing around!

57:03.921 --> 57:04.755
[Jim] This is bizarre.

57:04.855 --> 57:06.423
He's just lost.

57:06.524 --> 57:09.293
And still running in circles,
going absolutely nowhere.

57:09.393 --> 57:10.661
[Tony] Hold on a second.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.362
It looks like
he's changed course.

57:12.463 --> 57:14.732
Now he's headed directly
for the sidelines.

57:14.832 --> 57:18.368
What a strange way for
him to start the game.

57:18.469 --> 57:20.204
What is he doing now, Jim?

57:20.304 --> 57:23.007
[Jim] Tony, he's lost his mind.
He's just jumping around.

57:23.107 --> 57:25.075
Coleman is completely out of it.

57:25.175 --> 57:27.444
[Tony] I don't think jumping
around is going to help.

57:28.579 --> 57:29.379
[Jim] He passes the ball.

57:29.480 --> 57:30.314
Come on--

57:30.414 --> 57:31.381
[Crowd] Oh!

57:31.482 --> 57:33.083
[Jim] Right in the face!

57:33.183 --> 57:34.585
Coach Evans!

57:34.685 --> 57:37.788
[Tony] I think the only one
amused there is Anderson Fisher.

57:37.888 --> 57:39.256
[Jim] Exactly.

57:39.356 --> 57:41.391
This isn't funny.
He's out of--

57:41.492 --> 57:43.060
Right now he's doing the Worm.

57:43.160 --> 57:46.664
I mean, there's a ground game,
and then there's a ground game.

57:46.764 --> 57:48.833
But you don't do the Worm.

57:48.933 --> 57:51.401
[Tony] To be precise,
it's on the 46th yard line.

57:51.502 --> 57:53.370
He's being ridiculous.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.305
Hey, Fish time, baby!

57:55.405 --> 57:56.541
Way to go, Dad!

57:56.641 --> 57:58.008
[Jim] I don't know
what's happened.

57:58.108 --> 57:59.877
This is not the same guy
we've seen all season long.

57:59.977 --> 58:01.579
[Tony] I'm ready to
call it, partner.

58:01.679 --> 58:04.048
That was definitely one of
the dumbest things I've seen

58:04.148 --> 58:05.550
on a football field.
[phone ringing, vibrating]

58:05.650 --> 58:07.752
[Jim] And that will bring
an end to the first quarter,

58:07.852 --> 58:10.320
which has been
downright memorable

58:10.420 --> 58:12.022
for all the wrong reasons.

58:12.823 --> 58:14.825
Hey, Dad!
How's the game going?

58:14.925 --> 58:16.460
Callie, what are you doing?

58:16.561 --> 58:17.562
[Callie] What do you mean?

58:17.662 --> 58:18.996
You're the one doing everything!

58:19.096 --> 58:21.065
I'm pressing some buttons
to help out a little, right?

58:21.165 --> 58:22.800
Okay, okay, you made your point.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.835
We can talk about it
when I get home.

58:24.935 --> 58:26.236
Now I need you
to turn my play around

58:26.336 --> 58:28.639
so Anderson don't replace me.
Please.

58:28.739 --> 58:32.409
Mm, but have you
learned your lesson?

58:32.509 --> 58:34.478
Coleman! Come on.

58:34.579 --> 58:36.213
Coming, Coach!
Get my helmet.

58:36.313 --> 58:38.783
Lesson learned, all right?
Okay, thanks, bye.

58:40.517 --> 58:43.220
[phone vibrating, text chime]

58:45.355 --> 58:46.724
Okay.

58:46.824 --> 58:54.965
[music]

58:56.266 --> 58:57.868
Uh oh.

59:00.470 --> 59:01.706
Hi.

59:01.806 --> 59:03.473
Callie...

59:03.574 --> 59:04.875
We've been talking.

59:04.975 --> 59:07.444
And with nationals in a week...

59:07.544 --> 59:08.713
Screw lead-ins.

59:08.813 --> 59:10.748
You promised us a new robot arm.

59:10.848 --> 59:12.617
You called it SpongeBot 2.0,

59:12.717 --> 59:14.719
and yet we haven't seen
anything.

59:14.819 --> 59:15.953
Well, I mean, it's just taking

59:16.053 --> 59:18.288
a little bit of
extra time, that's all.

59:18.388 --> 59:20.024
Everything is coming
together, though.

59:20.124 --> 59:21.726
I'm just working on it at home.

59:21.826 --> 59:25.630
Nate knows! Right, Nate?

59:25.730 --> 59:26.964
Actually, I don't.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.266
I mean, you can show
us now, if you want.

59:29.366 --> 59:31.902
Um...

59:33.704 --> 59:35.339
Okay, well...

59:36.807 --> 59:39.276
The truth is...
I haven't finished it yet

59:40.110 --> 59:41.478
because I haven't
started it yet.

59:41.578 --> 59:43.080
You haven't started it yet?

59:43.180 --> 59:45.215
[Kayla] Callie, we
were counting on you.

59:45.315 --> 59:47.852
We didn't work on it
because you said you would.

59:47.952 --> 59:50.621
Without your changes,
we will be too far behind

59:50.721 --> 59:51.989
and laughed out of nationals.

59:52.089 --> 59:53.758
Like, laughed at,
not laughed with.

59:53.858 --> 59:55.125
I know, it's just, look,

59:55.225 --> 59:56.994
everything has been crazy
right now with my dad--

59:57.094 --> 1:00:00.064
Look, look, stop
with this dad stuff.

1:00:00.164 --> 1:00:02.399
We're not mad at him.
We're mad at you.

1:00:02.499 --> 1:00:04.034
And what happened to
wanting to be Callie Coleman

1:00:04.134 --> 1:00:06.370
and not Bobby Coleman's
daughter?

1:00:06.470 --> 1:00:08.572
[Kayla] You might not
need these scholarships

1:00:08.673 --> 1:00:11.876
because your dad is a
big, famous football player,

1:00:11.976 --> 1:00:13.410
but for some of us,

1:00:13.510 --> 1:00:16.280
that money could actually
make a huge difference!

1:00:16.380 --> 1:00:18.482
[Zoe] I'm gonna need
that iPhone case back.

1:00:18.582 --> 1:00:20.217
And the T-shirt too.

1:00:20.317 --> 1:00:22.887
I didn't know my amazing
craftsmanship would go to waste.

1:00:22.987 --> 1:00:29.459
[sad music]

1:00:29.559 --> 1:00:31.696
[sighs] Fine.

1:00:31.796 --> 1:00:33.898
But maybe, if
anyone actually knew

1:00:33.998 --> 1:00:35.532
what they were
doing on this team,

1:00:35.632 --> 1:00:38.903
this wouldn't be a problem!

1:00:40.137 --> 1:00:43.273
Too smart for this
mediocre crew anyways!

1:00:57.187 --> 1:00:58.422
[Woman] And then there were
the Falcons, right?

1:00:58.522 --> 1:01:01.225
There is no
better story in the NFC

1:01:01.325 --> 1:01:03.560
than Bobby "Comeback" Coleman.

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:05.195
He ain't all that.

1:01:05.295 --> 1:01:07.397
-- with a record-tying
six touchdown game.

1:01:07.497 --> 1:01:09.934
And now?
He's on the verge of breaking

1:01:10.034 --> 1:01:11.969
the single-season
rushing record.

1:01:12.069 --> 1:01:15.239
Yeah...
I did it first.

1:01:15.339 --> 1:01:16.941
I mean, you just wanna
root for this guy, right?

1:01:17.041 --> 1:01:19.043
Especially when you see
him with his daughter.

1:01:19.143 --> 1:01:20.878
Those two make quite the couple.

1:01:20.978 --> 1:01:22.179
[Woman] Oh, it's adorable.

1:01:22.279 --> 1:01:23.914
But, you know,
just been hanging out,

1:01:24.014 --> 1:01:25.716
playing a whole lot of Madden.

1:01:25.816 --> 1:01:27.918
[Man] Man, I love that
they play Madden together.

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:29.319
The way Bobby's been playing,

1:01:29.419 --> 1:01:32.256
it seems he's leveled up
in real life.

1:01:32.356 --> 1:01:34.324
It does seem like
that, doesn't it?

1:01:34.424 --> 1:01:35.926
[Man] ...but he might be getting

1:01:36.026 --> 1:01:37.294
a little nervous out there,
if I were him.

1:01:37.394 --> 1:01:38.829
Bobby Coleman's been
toting that rock.

1:01:38.929 --> 1:01:40.530
[Woman] It's like
Anderson who, right?

1:01:40.630 --> 1:01:42.166
[ding]

1:01:44.969 --> 1:01:48.505
[thunder rumbling outside]

1:01:52.276 --> 1:01:54.678
That's her exact same schedule.

1:01:58.215 --> 1:02:02.019
[crowd cheering]

1:02:02.586 --> 1:02:04.054
Hold up.

1:02:08.425 --> 1:02:10.961
[dinging]

1:02:11.061 --> 1:02:19.669
[music]

1:02:19.770 --> 1:02:22.272
Those are the exact same plays.

1:02:22.372 --> 1:02:28.745
[music]

1:02:28.846 --> 1:02:32.883
[crowd cheering]

1:02:32.983 --> 1:02:34.584
That's crazy, no.

1:02:37.922 --> 1:02:48.232
[music]

1:02:51.701 --> 1:02:53.070
Thank you.

1:02:53.170 --> 1:02:55.873
Callie! [laughs]

1:02:55.973 --> 1:02:58.775
-We're home!
-We brought you some food!

1:03:00.510 --> 1:03:01.745
Where is she?

1:03:01.846 --> 1:03:03.480
-I'll check on her.
-Okay.

1:03:03.580 --> 1:03:05.382
All right.

1:03:09.987 --> 1:03:11.221
[thunderclap]

1:03:11.321 --> 1:03:12.789
[Bobby] Oh, baby girl,
we got dinner down--

1:03:14.424 --> 1:03:15.792
Callie, what are you doing?

1:03:17.394 --> 1:03:18.662
Put the controller down now.

1:03:18.762 --> 1:03:20.430
I finally felt like
I belonged somewhere

1:03:20.530 --> 1:03:23.067
and now all my friends hate me.

1:03:23.167 --> 1:03:24.501
What are you talking about?

1:03:26.103 --> 1:03:28.172
This game ruined my life.

1:03:28.272 --> 1:03:30.607
Callie, we're dominating!
You're kidding me?

1:03:30.707 --> 1:03:32.576
I'm having the best
season of my career!

1:03:32.676 --> 1:03:33.878
And I'm having the worst!

1:03:33.978 --> 1:03:36.914
Isn't there something
wrong with that?

1:03:37.014 --> 1:03:39.316
Callie, think about
what you're doing.

1:03:41.785 --> 1:03:43.687
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:03:50.627 --> 1:03:52.562
[ding]

1:03:53.563 --> 1:03:55.699
No. No.

1:03:57.234 --> 1:03:58.969
What are you doing?

1:03:59.069 --> 1:04:00.337
Gotta go to Best Buy, right?

1:04:00.437 --> 1:04:02.539
They--they--they
can recover the data.

1:04:02.639 --> 1:04:05.342
Geek Squad, don't fail me now.
That whole thing?

1:04:05.442 --> 1:04:06.310
[zapping]

1:04:06.410 --> 1:04:08.212
[Callie]
Come on, leave it alone!

1:04:11.315 --> 1:04:14.751
Don't--Dad, what are you doing?
It's over! It's over!

1:04:16.053 --> 1:04:18.288
-Dad, look, stop!
-Hey!

1:04:18.388 --> 1:04:21.458
You're not gonna get it back.
It's gone, it's gone!

1:04:21.558 --> 1:04:25.495
No, Callie, I'm taking it!
Give me the game!

1:04:25.595 --> 1:04:26.563
Callie, Callie!

1:04:26.663 --> 1:04:28.632
I wish none of this
had ever happened!

1:04:28.732 --> 1:04:32.736
[zapping]

1:04:34.638 --> 1:04:37.674
You guys are insane!
What is going on with you two?

1:04:38.742 --> 1:04:41.678
-Is this about that video game?
-No, it's not just the game.

1:04:41.778 --> 1:04:44.314
What she really means is more
of a metaphor, right Callie?

1:04:44.414 --> 1:04:46.750
No!

1:04:46.850 --> 1:04:50.854
This game has some sort of
weird body controlling thing.

1:04:50.955 --> 1:04:52.556
Please feel free
to expand on that.

1:04:52.656 --> 1:04:55.392
Mom, whatever I do in the game,
it happens in real life.

1:04:55.492 --> 1:04:58.162
That's the reason
Dad's been playing so well!

1:04:59.196 --> 1:05:02.799
[laughs]

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:05.435
Callie Amber Coleman,
is that what you think?

1:05:05.535 --> 1:05:08.438
It's true. It's true, Keish.

1:05:10.007 --> 1:05:11.408
I know it does sound insane,

1:05:11.508 --> 1:05:14.344
but the game has some
sort of power over me.

1:05:14.444 --> 1:05:16.513
Or at least, it used to.

1:05:16.613 --> 1:05:18.949
-And now I got nothin'!
-Excuse me?

1:05:19.049 --> 1:05:20.384
Your daughter and
I are not nothin'.

1:05:20.484 --> 1:05:21.885
But we'll come back to that.

1:05:21.986 --> 1:05:24.288
Because what I just heard
come out of both of your faces

1:05:24.388 --> 1:05:27.191
is that whatever Callie
does in a video game,

1:05:27.291 --> 1:05:28.825
Bobby mirrors on the
field move for move.

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:31.228
Is that correct?

1:05:31.328 --> 1:05:33.530
And you two aren't
messing with me?

1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:38.302
How could you two keep
something like this a secret?

1:05:38.402 --> 1:05:39.736
Mom, I'm sorry, I
wanted to tell you,

1:05:39.836 --> 1:05:41.071
but Dad said not to--

1:05:41.171 --> 1:05:42.639
Wait, wait, wait,
you're sorry about that?

1:05:42.739 --> 1:05:46.043
How 'bout the fact that you just
made all of my skills disappear?

1:05:46.143 --> 1:05:48.212
Gone, poof, just like that!

1:05:48.312 --> 1:05:50.347
And right before the
playoffs are about to start?

1:05:50.447 --> 1:05:52.549
And by the way, I was about
to break the rushing record.

1:05:52.649 --> 1:05:55.752
That's literally
all you care about!

1:05:56.853 --> 1:05:59.523
Callie...
Baby girl...

1:05:59.623 --> 1:06:01.225
This was a win/win
for both of us.

1:06:01.325 --> 1:06:02.692
And all our dreams
were finally coming true.

1:06:02.792 --> 1:06:04.628
Your dreams!

1:06:04.728 --> 1:06:07.131
But what about me?

1:06:07.231 --> 1:06:09.166
I was finally starting
to become my own person!

1:06:09.266 --> 1:06:11.735
Not everything
is just about you!

1:06:15.272 --> 1:06:18.808
You told our daughter
to lie to me?

1:06:18.908 --> 1:06:20.277
-Listen, Keisha...
-No.

1:06:20.377 --> 1:06:22.446
You don't get to talk right now.

1:06:22.546 --> 1:06:24.414
What happened to
us being a unit?

1:06:24.514 --> 1:06:27.051
I mean, I get it.
You're Mr. Bigshot on the field.

1:06:27.151 --> 1:06:31.621
But in this house?
We're partners.

1:06:31.721 --> 1:06:35.759
And right now...it sure
doesn't feel that way.

1:06:35.859 --> 1:06:37.661
-I mean, Keisha--
-No.

1:06:37.761 --> 1:06:39.496
Callie!

1:06:43.033 --> 1:06:45.969
[thunderclap]
[rain pattering]

1:06:50.074 --> 1:06:51.908
* Yeah, well you the GOAT

1:06:53.410 --> 1:06:57.414
Hey, first game of the playoffs,
baby, let's go!

1:06:57.514 --> 1:07:00.550
Hey, you ready to bring some
of that Bobby Coleman action?

1:07:00.650 --> 1:07:02.452
You know it!
You know it!

1:07:02.552 --> 1:07:05.289
[indistinct chatter]

1:07:10.294 --> 1:07:12.662
Coleman!

1:07:12.762 --> 1:07:14.331
Where's Bobby?

1:07:14.431 --> 1:07:17.167
-Coleman, there you are.
-[Man] That sweater is terrible!

1:07:17.267 --> 1:07:19.035
I know your secret.

1:07:19.136 --> 1:07:21.771
I know all about what you and
your little daughter been up to.

1:07:21.871 --> 1:07:22.706
Check it out, Joe.

1:07:22.806 --> 1:07:24.108
When his daughter plays Madden,

1:07:24.208 --> 1:07:25.975
it makes him good
at actual football.

1:07:26.076 --> 1:07:28.512
Everything she does on the
game he does on the field.

1:07:28.612 --> 1:07:30.314
Yo, no offense, but what?

1:07:30.414 --> 1:07:32.549
Look, I don't know
how you're doing it,

1:07:32.649 --> 1:07:35.018
but I got proof.
I got proof!

1:07:35.119 --> 1:07:36.953
His daughter recorded
her Madden gameplay,

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:39.256
and it was exactly the same
as his six-touchdown game

1:07:39.356 --> 1:07:41.258
a few months back.

1:07:41.358 --> 1:07:42.759
-Hey, I just leveled up!
-Scoot over.

1:07:42.859 --> 1:07:45.629
-[Man] Come on, now!
-[Man] What you doin'?

1:07:45.729 --> 1:07:46.696
[Man] Give the controller back.

1:07:46.796 --> 1:07:49.065
[Anderson]
[laughs gleefully]

1:07:49.166 --> 1:07:51.101
[Man] What's wrong, man?

1:07:51.201 --> 1:07:52.436
[Man] What you doin'?

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:55.071
[buzzer]
What?

1:07:55.639 --> 1:07:57.441
[buzzer]
No, no. Where is it?

1:07:57.541 --> 1:07:59.109
No, no, it was right here.
I saw it.

1:07:59.209 --> 1:08:00.744
She recorded it.

1:08:00.844 --> 1:08:03.747
Look, y'all remember when
he had that six-touchdown game.

1:08:03.847 --> 1:08:05.849
Right? It was the same on
Madden , too!

1:08:08.285 --> 1:08:11.020
Admit it, Bobby!

1:08:11.121 --> 1:08:12.556
You and that daughter of yours?

1:08:12.656 --> 1:08:14.858
Y'all made some kind of deal
with a real-life game genie.

1:08:14.958 --> 1:08:16.826
Boom! Busted!

1:08:16.926 --> 1:08:19.529
[indistinct chatter]

1:08:27.036 --> 1:08:29.639
[laughs]

1:08:29.739 --> 1:08:34.077
[Players join in laughter]

1:08:36.746 --> 1:08:41.017
[laughs]
Wake up, fam!

1:08:41.117 --> 1:08:42.752
In, like, one day he
went from rickety old man

1:08:42.852 --> 1:08:44.854
to some kind of
superhero overnight?

1:08:44.954 --> 1:08:47.457
What do you think caused that?
Multivitamins?

1:08:47.557 --> 1:08:49.293
I think not.
You know what it was?

1:08:49.393 --> 1:08:51.361
It was his magical video game.

1:08:51.461 --> 1:08:53.463
That's right, Bobby.
I figured it out.

1:08:53.563 --> 1:08:55.865
-I got my butt back.
-You got your butt back?

1:08:55.965 --> 1:08:57.000
It's a Gen Z thing.

1:08:57.100 --> 1:08:59.569
[Bobby] Hey, hey.

1:08:59.669 --> 1:09:01.238
Why don't we just play football?

1:09:01.338 --> 1:09:03.273
Right, AF?

1:09:03.373 --> 1:09:04.574
Just play ball.

1:09:04.674 --> 1:09:06.376
'Cause you sound crazy.

1:09:06.476 --> 1:09:07.644
-I'm not crazy, y'all.
-[Bobby] You sound crazy.

1:09:07.744 --> 1:09:10.079
I'm not crazy.
I'm not going insane.

1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:11.315
It was on the game!

1:09:11.415 --> 1:09:13.950
Man, shut up!
I'm with Bobby.

1:09:14.050 --> 1:09:15.485
[screams]

1:09:15.585 --> 1:09:17.187
That boy crazy, man.

1:09:17.287 --> 1:09:19.155
[indistinct chatter]

1:09:19.256 --> 1:09:21.425
-Let's focus up.
-It's on the game.

1:09:21.525 --> 1:09:24.294
[indistinct chatter]

1:09:24.394 --> 1:09:25.829
[Player] Yeeeaahhh!

1:09:27.497 --> 1:09:28.465
[Crowd on TV]
[cheers and applause]

1:09:28.565 --> 1:09:30.033
It's starting,
if you wanna watch!

1:09:30.133 --> 1:09:31.735
[Callie] I'm good!

1:09:32.236 --> 1:09:33.603
[Jim] Taylor, the quarterback.

1:09:33.703 --> 1:09:35.439
Coleman in the back field.

1:09:35.539 --> 1:09:37.341
And they'll hand it off
to Coleman.

1:09:37.441 --> 1:09:39.643
Oh! He fumbles right away.

1:09:39.743 --> 1:09:42.512
But the Falcons do
keep possession.

1:09:42.612 --> 1:09:43.847
Now they throw it to Coleman.

1:09:43.947 --> 1:09:45.782
And it goes directly
through his hands.

1:09:45.882 --> 1:09:47.251
Bobby!

1:09:47.351 --> 1:09:49.486
[Tony] Jim, as I suspected,
Bobby Coleman's going out

1:09:49.586 --> 1:09:51.655
and Anderson Fisher's coming in.

1:09:51.755 --> 1:09:53.156
[Jim] You can't blame him.

1:09:53.257 --> 1:09:55.392
Coleman just doesn't
look like himself out there.

1:09:55.492 --> 1:09:56.593
[Tony] Yeah, well,
technically, Jim,

1:09:56.693 --> 1:09:58.262
he hasn't looked
like himself all season.

1:09:58.362 --> 1:09:59.929
I mean, he started off on fire.

1:10:00.029 --> 1:10:02.832
But today we saw him revert
back to that fumble-throwing guy

1:10:02.932 --> 1:10:05.335
that we've seen throughout
most of his NFL career.

1:10:05.435 --> 1:10:08.004
Isn't this the worst?

1:10:08.104 --> 1:10:09.439
What?

1:10:09.539 --> 1:10:11.275
Feeling bad for
someone you're mad at.

1:10:11.375 --> 1:10:12.976
Takes all the fun out of it.

1:10:13.076 --> 1:10:16.079
I mean, no matter how
angry I get at that man--

1:10:16.179 --> 1:10:19.416
and he can test me--

1:10:19.516 --> 1:10:21.818
I never wanna see him struggle.

1:10:21.918 --> 1:10:25.989
And we both know
he's had his struggles.

1:10:26.089 --> 1:10:29.426
But that's the thing
about loving someone.

1:10:29.526 --> 1:10:33.530
You never stop rooting for them.

1:10:39.135 --> 1:10:40.937
[sighs]

1:10:42.071 --> 1:10:43.473
[Man on radio]
Thanks to Anderson Fisher,

1:10:43.573 --> 1:10:45.275
the Falcons were able
to eke out the win today

1:10:45.375 --> 1:10:46.510
to keep their season alive.

1:10:46.610 --> 1:10:47.844
Man, but how about
Bobby Coleman?

1:10:47.944 --> 1:10:49.313
Looks like his
so-called resurgence

1:10:49.413 --> 1:10:50.514
was just a fluke.

1:10:50.614 --> 1:10:51.581
Pathetic!

1:10:51.681 --> 1:10:53.583
I say just retire.

1:10:56.420 --> 1:10:59.155
Keisha?
Look, I apologize--

1:10:59.255 --> 1:11:00.690
Not now.
I can't find Callie.

1:11:00.790 --> 1:11:02.392
She left after the game and
she hasn't answered her phone

1:11:02.492 --> 1:11:03.560
for two hours.

1:11:03.660 --> 1:11:05.061
Has she mentioned any plans?

1:11:05.161 --> 1:11:06.930
No, she's got that robotics
competition thing coming up

1:11:07.030 --> 1:11:08.798
and she might be at
the school, but let's go.

1:11:08.898 --> 1:11:10.099
Okay.

1:11:15.705 --> 1:11:18.775
Excuse me? Hi.
We're Callie's parents.

1:11:18.875 --> 1:11:20.877
Oh yeah, we met at your
house the other day, right?

1:11:20.977 --> 1:11:22.546
Wait, he was at our house?
When was this?

1:11:22.646 --> 1:11:24.180
Not now, not now.
We're looking for Callie.

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:29.353
Uh, we kind of had to
kick her off of the team.

1:11:29.453 --> 1:11:32.055
Wait, why?
She loves it so much.

1:11:32.155 --> 1:11:33.790
Yeah, see, she was
supposed to figure out

1:11:33.890 --> 1:11:36.393
this big element
of our robot, but--

1:11:36.493 --> 1:11:38.027
no offense to Mr. Coleman--

1:11:38.127 --> 1:11:40.864
she was so consumed
by your success

1:11:40.964 --> 1:11:46.269
that she didn't really
have much time left for us.

1:11:46.370 --> 1:11:48.338
And she's super good.
I mean, she the whole reason

1:11:48.438 --> 1:11:49.806
we even made it
to the nationals.

1:11:49.906 --> 1:11:51.441
Yeah, well, now she
is the whole reason why

1:11:51.541 --> 1:11:54.478
we are completely screwed.

1:11:54.578 --> 1:11:56.713
Uh, sorry for the language.

1:11:56.813 --> 1:11:59.148
It's just I don't think
we're gonna find another Callie

1:11:59.248 --> 1:12:01.017
before nationals.

1:12:01.117 --> 1:12:02.619
Lightning definitely
doesn't strike twice.

1:12:02.719 --> 1:12:05.955
[thunderclap]

1:12:06.055 --> 1:12:07.857
-I know where she is.
-Where?

1:12:07.957 --> 1:12:09.626
Babe, I know where she is.
Thank you! Thank you!

1:12:09.726 --> 1:12:11.495
And sorry.

1:12:11.595 --> 1:12:16.065
[music]

1:12:23.607 --> 1:12:24.741
[Bobby] Right there!
There she is.

1:12:24.841 --> 1:12:26.943
[Keisha] What in the
world is she doing?

1:12:29.479 --> 1:12:31.481
[Bobby] Callie! Callie!

1:12:31.581 --> 1:12:33.249
Dad, please stop!

1:12:33.349 --> 1:12:34.651
I'm trying to fix this!

1:12:34.751 --> 1:12:36.420
All I need to do is get
struck by lightning again.

1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:37.887
-Baby girl, no!
-Baby, this is insane.

1:12:37.987 --> 1:12:40.590
-You're gonna get hurt!
-But it's all my fault!

1:12:40.690 --> 1:12:42.526
I mean, everything was
great until I ruined it.

1:12:42.626 --> 1:12:45.294
No, you said it--we're a team.

1:12:45.395 --> 1:12:46.596
You didn't drop the ball.

1:12:46.696 --> 1:12:48.498
I'm the one who
dropped the ball.

1:12:48.598 --> 1:12:51.100
You've already given me so much.
You have!

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:52.869
And now you're
standing in the rain,

1:12:52.969 --> 1:12:55.271
trying to get yourself
struck by lightning,

1:12:55.371 --> 1:12:57.674
-all for me again.
-But football is your life!

1:12:57.774 --> 1:13:01.845
No, baby.
No! You're my life.

1:13:01.945 --> 1:13:04.213
Don't you see? It's you.

1:13:04.313 --> 1:13:07.617
And you're smarter and more
talented than I could ever be.

1:13:07.717 --> 1:13:09.018
You led your team to nationals!

1:13:09.118 --> 1:13:10.654
Yeah, and then I
let them all down!

1:13:10.754 --> 1:13:12.121
[Bobby] No, no, no,
that's no me too, okay?

1:13:12.221 --> 1:13:14.591
I just got caught up, you
know, in all the attention.

1:13:14.691 --> 1:13:16.926
I didn't think about
how it affected you.

1:13:17.026 --> 1:13:18.294
Then I asked you to
lie to your mother.

1:13:18.394 --> 1:13:20.630
I shouldn't have asked
you to lie to anyone.

1:13:20.730 --> 1:13:26.235
So, I'm sorry, okay?
You hear me?

1:13:26.335 --> 1:13:27.671
I'm sorry.

1:13:28.772 --> 1:13:31.875
I'm sorry to you,
and I'm sorry to you.

1:13:33.409 --> 1:13:36.245
I guess I thought that
being on top of the world

1:13:36.345 --> 1:13:38.347
would mean that I could
give you both the world.

1:13:38.448 --> 1:13:41.350
But really you just wanted
me right here, present.

1:13:41.451 --> 1:13:44.153
So I'm here, present.

1:13:45.989 --> 1:13:47.691
I mean, with the playoffs
and everything, it's just--

1:13:47.791 --> 1:13:51.961
No, hey, come here, come here.
Come here.

1:13:54.163 --> 1:13:57.601
It's just a game.
You get it?

1:13:57.701 --> 1:14:01.304
The playoffs...
It's just a game.

1:14:01.404 --> 1:14:05.775
You mean everything to me.
You and your mama.

1:14:11.581 --> 1:14:14.050
[sighs]

1:14:14.150 --> 1:14:15.652
We really need to
get out of this rain

1:14:15.752 --> 1:14:17.086
because we're going
to get pneumonia.

1:14:17.186 --> 1:14:18.087
Please come over.

1:14:18.187 --> 1:14:20.990
Mom, pneumonia's
a little extreme.

1:14:21.090 --> 1:14:23.159
Worst-case scenario,
it's probably just the sniffles.

1:14:23.259 --> 1:14:27.096
[Keisha] Please, just trust me.
I am a medical professional.

1:14:27.196 --> 1:14:35.905
[music]

1:14:44.548 --> 1:14:49.653
[music]

1:14:49.753 --> 1:14:51.521
-Good morning!
-Whoa!

1:14:51.621 --> 1:14:53.757
-Ha, ha, ha.
-What's going on?

1:14:53.857 --> 1:14:55.258
Let's go, let's go.
We got work to do.

1:14:55.358 --> 1:14:56.626
What?

1:14:56.726 --> 1:14:58.728
Come on, come on.

1:14:58.828 --> 1:15:01.130
It's 6 o'clock in the
morning on a Saturday.

1:15:01.230 --> 1:15:04.067
Yeah. This isn't about me.
Today is not about me.

1:15:04.167 --> 1:15:05.434
-Come on!
-Dad, Dad, stop.

1:15:05.535 --> 1:15:07.270
We gotta go. Hey, hey!

1:15:07.370 --> 1:15:09.906
You drivin', Miss Thing.

1:15:10.006 --> 1:15:12.175
That's right.
I'll see you downstairs.

1:15:12.275 --> 1:15:14.210
Breakfast on the table.
Let's rock!

1:15:14.310 --> 1:15:18.548
[music]

1:15:18.648 --> 1:15:22.786
The most important game
of your career is tomorrow.

1:15:22.886 --> 1:15:25.354
Are you sure you wanna
spend your day here?

1:15:25.454 --> 1:15:27.557
Yeah, I do.

1:15:27.657 --> 1:15:28.858
You get this thing done,

1:15:28.958 --> 1:15:30.326
you guys still have
a shot at nationals.

1:15:30.426 --> 1:15:33.096
I'm gonna stay here, help you as
long as it takes to get it done.

1:15:33.196 --> 1:15:34.764
All right?

1:15:34.864 --> 1:15:38.001
But I do have one question.

1:15:38.101 --> 1:15:39.836
What is all of this stuff?

1:15:39.936 --> 1:15:42.939
And, uh, how does
any of it work?

1:15:43.973 --> 1:15:46.042
* Oh no, got me goin' loco

1:15:46.142 --> 1:15:47.744
* Make me go berserk-o

1:15:47.844 --> 1:15:49.378
* Shake it in a circle

1:15:49.478 --> 1:15:50.479
* Circle

1:15:50.580 --> 1:15:52.616
* Oh no, got me goin' loco

1:15:52.716 --> 1:15:54.417
* Gotta put in work, though

1:15:54.517 --> 1:15:56.586
[clanking]

1:15:56.686 --> 1:16:01.891
[music]

1:16:01.991 --> 1:16:02.992
* Make it work

1:16:03.092 --> 1:16:04.828
* Lo--lo--lo--loco

1:16:06.896 --> 1:16:08.464
Lookin' sharp.

1:16:08.564 --> 1:16:10.066
* Loco

1:16:11.434 --> 1:16:12.168
What's wrong?

1:16:12.268 --> 1:16:17.340
Uh, there's a piece missing.

1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:20.409
A small bronze cylinder
about this big here.

1:16:20.509 --> 1:16:21.978
See?

1:16:22.078 --> 1:16:23.479
It's supposed to be
here as a counterweight

1:16:23.579 --> 1:16:25.148
for this upper joint.

1:16:25.248 --> 1:16:27.116
The arm won't work without it.

1:16:28.417 --> 1:16:30.219
Ah, what about this?

1:16:32.288 --> 1:16:33.623
Nope.

1:16:33.723 --> 1:16:35.692
See, this one is too light to
provide the torque that we need.

1:16:35.792 --> 1:16:37.761
I've torqued about enough.

1:16:37.861 --> 1:16:39.495
[laughs]

1:16:39.595 --> 1:16:42.966
Without the counterweight,
the balance is off.

1:16:43.066 --> 1:16:46.535
And you say that it's a bronze
cylinder about this big?

1:16:48.905 --> 1:16:51.007
Come with me. Come on.

1:16:54.778 --> 1:16:56.512
I don't think
I completely understand.

1:16:56.612 --> 1:16:59.415
You want me to cut off the
arm of your Heisman Trophy?

1:16:59.515 --> 1:17:01.617
Yeah, because this
young lady right here,

1:17:01.718 --> 1:17:03.953
well, she matters way more to me
than some piece of metal, right?

1:17:04.053 --> 1:17:06.589
So just cut that arm
right off my Heisman.

1:17:06.690 --> 1:17:09.926
[laughs]
We got a robot to build.

1:17:10.026 --> 1:17:11.761
Wow, uh, it seems like

1:17:11.861 --> 1:17:14.230
I'm missing some
significant context here.

1:17:14.330 --> 1:17:16.432
But we don't have to do that.

1:17:16.532 --> 1:17:19.803
I can just sell you
a piece of bronze.

1:17:19.903 --> 1:17:22.071
-Oh.
-I mean, is that okay?

1:17:22.171 --> 1:17:23.239
I mean, that way you can have

1:17:23.339 --> 1:17:24.808
your cake and eat
it too, you know?

1:17:24.908 --> 1:17:26.109
-Way better.
-[Man] Okay.

1:17:26.209 --> 1:17:28.111
-Way better.
-I'm gonna go get the bronze.

1:17:28.211 --> 1:17:30.346
I will be back.
Don't go anywhere.

1:17:30.446 --> 1:17:32.548
-Win-win.
-Yeah.

1:17:32.648 --> 1:17:34.250
[laughs]

1:17:35.651 --> 1:17:37.220
[robot whirring]

1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:39.255
Um, guys!?

1:17:39.355 --> 1:17:42.391
[robot whirring]

1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:46.529
SpongeBot SpareParts!

1:17:46.629 --> 1:17:49.332
Ooh, with a new arm, too.

1:17:50.133 --> 1:17:51.267
[digital beeping]

1:17:51.367 --> 1:17:52.802
[Callie] Hey, it's Callie.

1:17:52.902 --> 1:17:55.471
Um, I owe you an apology.

1:17:55.571 --> 1:17:58.307
You were relying on me,
and I didn't deliver.

1:17:58.407 --> 1:18:01.144
If you don't want me back,
I completely understand.

1:18:01.244 --> 1:18:03.747
But y'all mean everything to me.

1:18:03.847 --> 1:18:05.114
Either way, I want you to take

1:18:05.214 --> 1:18:07.150
this finished
SpongeBot 2.0 to nationals

1:18:07.250 --> 1:18:09.318
and destroy the competition,

1:18:09.418 --> 1:18:13.189
and also crush, obliterate,
and annihilate them.

1:18:13.990 --> 1:18:15.725
[screams]

1:18:15.825 --> 1:18:17.360
Oh, jeez.

1:18:19.695 --> 1:18:20.696
-You good?
-Yeah, yeah.

1:18:20.797 --> 1:18:22.065
Um...

1:18:22.165 --> 1:18:23.532
That was, um...

1:18:23.632 --> 1:18:25.268
That was supposed to
be a way cooler reveal.

1:18:25.368 --> 1:18:28.104
Wow, hiding in a tree, yeah.
That's creepy.

1:18:28.204 --> 1:18:29.405
Yeah, it's not my best look.

1:18:29.505 --> 1:18:32.108
Look, I'm sorry for
the mean things I said.

1:18:32.208 --> 1:18:33.877
Yeah, me too, it
got pretty brutal.

1:18:33.977 --> 1:18:36.079
Yeah, and I'm sorry for, um...

1:18:36.179 --> 1:18:39.215
Well, SpongeBot kind of
covered it.

1:18:39.315 --> 1:18:44.320
I, uh, think these
belong to you.

1:18:45.955 --> 1:18:47.323
What do you guys think?

1:18:47.423 --> 1:18:48.758
Shall we see what this
little guy can do?

1:18:48.858 --> 1:18:49.759
[Group] Yes!

1:18:49.859 --> 1:18:51.327
Let's go!

1:18:52.295 --> 1:18:54.197
[whirring]
[whoosh]

1:18:55.164 --> 1:18:57.633
Zoe, Kayla, you're up!
Go long.

1:18:57.733 --> 1:19:03.572
[music]

1:19:04.273 --> 1:19:06.309
[Margo] Launch it!

1:19:06.876 --> 1:19:07.777
Oh my god, Oliver!

1:19:07.877 --> 1:19:09.345
So, um...

1:19:09.445 --> 1:19:10.513
[Kayla] You were
supposed to catch it

1:19:10.613 --> 1:19:12.315
so it doesn't break
our windshield!

1:19:12.415 --> 1:19:13.516
Are we cool?

1:19:13.616 --> 1:19:17.286
Even though I acted very
weird when you came over?

1:19:17.386 --> 1:19:19.688
-Yeah, we cool.
-Okay.

1:19:19.789 --> 1:19:23.326
And for the record...

1:19:23.426 --> 1:19:26.195
you being incredibly weird
is the reason I like you.

1:19:29.498 --> 1:19:31.267
[Bobby] Callie!

1:19:32.135 --> 1:19:34.203
Uh, I'ma head home, all right?

1:19:34.303 --> 1:19:37.006
You stay and enjoy your friends.

1:19:37.106 --> 1:19:39.642
And the car is
yours for the day.

1:19:39.742 --> 1:19:41.644
[laughs] Thank you!

1:19:41.744 --> 1:19:43.246
[horn honking]

1:19:45.248 --> 1:19:47.483
Your mom just pulled up
to pick me up.

1:19:47.583 --> 1:19:48.717
And be safe.

1:19:48.818 --> 1:19:49.986
[laughs]

1:19:50.086 --> 1:19:51.855
-Hey!
-Hey.

1:19:51.955 --> 1:19:54.390
I'm Nate.

1:19:54.490 --> 1:19:58.194
Nathaniel? Nate.

1:19:58.294 --> 1:20:01.164
You can call me Nathaniel.

1:20:01.264 --> 1:20:03.499
We didn't really actually
get a chance to meet?

1:20:03.599 --> 1:20:05.668
I just wanted to let you know
that it's been a pleasure

1:20:05.768 --> 1:20:07.937
-being with your daughter.
-Ooh, say what?

1:20:08.037 --> 1:20:13.576
Um, uh, having contact with
her--interpersonally, though.

1:20:13.676 --> 1:20:15.811
Because of robotics?

1:20:15.912 --> 1:20:17.013
Yeah, because of robotics.

1:20:17.113 --> 1:20:20.249
[laughs] Robotics.

1:20:20.349 --> 1:20:24.687
Look, it's an honor to
meet you, Mr. Bobby, Robert...

1:20:24.787 --> 1:20:27.023
-Mr. Coleman is perfect.
-Right, Mr. Coleman.

1:20:27.123 --> 1:20:29.458
-Mr. Coleman.
-Yeah.

1:20:29.558 --> 1:20:31.427
[Bobby] Well, thank you, Nate.

1:20:31.527 --> 1:20:32.962
Pleasure to meet
you too, young man.

1:20:33.062 --> 1:20:37.700
And remember, I
got my eye on you.

1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:38.734
-Right.
-Right.

1:20:38.834 --> 1:20:40.636
Right.

1:20:41.204 --> 1:20:42.505
* Are you ready?

1:20:42.605 --> 1:20:44.307
[Tony] Jim, the energy
here at Mercedes-Benz

1:20:44.407 --> 1:20:46.275
is electric.
A sold-out crowd

1:20:46.375 --> 1:20:48.377
is hoping to see their Falcons

1:20:48.477 --> 1:20:50.213
punch their ticket
to the Super Bowl.

1:20:50.313 --> 1:20:51.881
But they gotta go through
the Saints here today.

1:20:51.981 --> 1:20:52.949
That's right, partner.

1:20:53.049 --> 1:20:54.750
And all eyes are
on Bobby Coleman,

1:20:54.850 --> 1:20:57.286
who's had the Cinderella season.

1:20:57.386 --> 1:21:00.656
But he came out last game
looking like Sleeping Beauty.

1:21:00.756 --> 1:21:02.391
Yes, but even after
that performance,

1:21:02.491 --> 1:21:05.161
he's still just 45 yards
away from overtaking

1:21:05.261 --> 1:21:08.264
Anderson Fisher's
single-season rushing record.

1:21:08.364 --> 1:21:10.033
But the big question
is, will Coach Evans

1:21:10.133 --> 1:21:12.135
give him the minutes
he needs to do it?

1:21:12.235 --> 1:21:15.138
-These seats are incredible!
-Okay.

1:21:15.238 --> 1:21:18.107
-You do this every Sunday?
-Um...

1:21:18.207 --> 1:21:20.043
This season's been
a little different.

1:21:20.143 --> 1:21:22.979
Yo, I'll take a dog!
Oh, dog, you want a dog?

1:21:23.079 --> 1:21:24.747
Make that double dog!
With kraut.

1:21:24.847 --> 1:21:28.484
Everybody gets a sign.

1:21:28.851 --> 1:21:31.420
Callie, you are
the exclamation point.

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:33.156
Oh, Ms. Coleman, I'm sorry.

1:21:33.256 --> 1:21:34.423
I should've
brought you one too.

1:21:34.523 --> 1:21:35.691
[Keisha] It's okay, honey.

1:21:35.791 --> 1:21:38.627
I consider myself a
human exclamation point.

1:21:38.727 --> 1:21:40.263
Okay.

1:21:40.363 --> 1:21:44.633
[Jim] And the NFC
championship game is underway.

1:21:44.733 --> 1:21:47.036
And this will go
for a touchback.

1:21:47.136 --> 1:21:48.337
Signs up! Signs up!

1:21:48.437 --> 1:21:51.140
[cheers and applause]

1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:52.608
Come on, Bobby!

1:21:52.708 --> 1:21:54.810
[Tony] Coach Evans going
with Bobby Coleman.

1:21:54.910 --> 1:21:57.480
Wow, I can't believe
it, but I love it.

1:22:02.151 --> 1:22:03.987
[Jim] And Coleman,
right off the bat,

1:22:04.087 --> 1:22:05.821
is hit hard for a loss.

1:22:06.722 --> 1:22:07.991
[Tony] Well, the
Saints are not gonna

1:22:08.091 --> 1:22:09.458
make this easy
for Bobby Coleman.

1:22:09.558 --> 1:22:13.096
Get it together, Bobby!
They're crushing you out there!

1:22:13.196 --> 1:22:15.598
-Your mom is a little...
-Passionate?

1:22:15.698 --> 1:22:19.202
-I was gonna say terrifying.
-Yeah, that too.

1:22:19.302 --> 1:22:23.072
[Jim] And now the Saints head to
the end zone on a quick strike.

1:22:23.172 --> 1:22:24.640
Taylor going deep.

1:22:26.675 --> 1:22:29.278
And it's caught.
Touchdown, Falcons.

1:22:29.378 --> 1:22:30.879
[Tony] Taylor with
a perfect throw.

1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:34.283
That's how you gotta score
against this defense.

1:22:35.484 --> 1:22:38.121
[Jim] Handoff, Coleman.
And he fumbles it.

1:22:38.221 --> 1:22:39.888
And the Saints recover.

1:22:39.989 --> 1:22:43.026
[Tony] All of last week's
troubles not quite behind him.

1:22:43.126 --> 1:22:44.360
And touchdown, Saints.

1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:47.430
And they do the little
bowling ball!

1:22:47.530 --> 1:22:50.399
[Jim] Saints are feeling
comfortable in enemy territory.

1:22:50.499 --> 1:22:53.902
And oh, Coleman once
again coughs it up.

1:22:54.003 --> 1:22:56.305
[Tony] That's it.
Coach Evans says you're done.

1:22:56.405 --> 1:22:58.507
I'm going to Anderson Fisher.

1:23:00.009 --> 1:23:02.611
[Jim] And Fisher looking
like he did last year.

1:23:02.711 --> 1:23:05.314
Into the end zone for sixth.

1:23:06.415 --> 1:23:07.450
How do you handle this?

1:23:07.550 --> 1:23:08.551
It's like my heart
is gonna explode!

1:23:08.651 --> 1:23:09.885
You gotta let it out, man.

1:23:09.985 --> 1:23:11.487
Come on, scream with me.

1:23:11.587 --> 1:23:12.921
[screams]

1:23:13.022 --> 1:23:14.323
[screams]

1:23:14.423 --> 1:23:15.858
[Jim] And folks, the
game is essentially

1:23:15.958 --> 1:23:17.326
coming down to this.

1:23:18.527 --> 1:23:22.098
One final chance
for the Falcons.

1:23:22.198 --> 1:23:23.766
[Tony] They're trying
to get lined up.

1:23:23.866 --> 1:23:25.334
But the nerves are
here, you can tell.

1:23:25.434 --> 1:23:27.536
Look at this.

1:23:27.970 --> 1:23:29.572
42!

1:23:29.672 --> 1:23:31.707
[Jim] Now there's just
a lot of confusion.

1:23:31.807 --> 1:23:34.510
And Taylor is gonna
have to take a timeout.

1:23:34.610 --> 1:23:36.479
It's been a
back-and-forth battle

1:23:36.579 --> 1:23:38.847
between these phenomenal teams.

1:23:38.947 --> 1:23:40.849
And despite Fisher
getting more minutes,

1:23:40.949 --> 1:23:43.786
Bobby Coleman has managed
to get within 10 yards

1:23:43.886 --> 1:23:45.788
of that rushing record.

1:23:45.888 --> 1:23:47.190
[Tony] Well, Comeback
Coleman has had

1:23:47.290 --> 1:23:48.891
an unbelievable season.

1:23:48.991 --> 1:23:52.428
But Anderson Fisher, he seems
to be more reliable right now.

1:23:52.528 --> 1:23:55.298
[digital beeping]

1:23:56.999 --> 1:23:58.867
42!

1:23:58.967 --> 1:24:00.236
Time out!

1:24:00.336 --> 1:24:01.437
[whistle blowing]

1:24:01.537 --> 1:24:03.239
Zeros and ones.

1:24:03.339 --> 1:24:05.141
-What?
-I've got it!

1:24:05.241 --> 1:24:09.612
So analyzing football plays is
a lot like coding in Python.

1:24:09.712 --> 1:24:11.747
Yeah, yeah, I'm not following.

1:24:11.847 --> 1:24:13.816
The patterns are finite.
So if you gather enough data,

1:24:13.916 --> 1:24:15.451
you can get a sense
of which plays

1:24:15.551 --> 1:24:17.353
are more or less
efficient against others.

1:24:17.453 --> 1:24:19.088
And based on my predictive
analytics, I mean,

1:24:19.188 --> 1:24:20.456
the defense--

1:24:20.556 --> 1:24:24.560
Wait, wait, wait, don't tell us.
Go tell them.

1:24:24.660 --> 1:24:26.095
Who?
The players on the field?

1:24:26.195 --> 1:24:27.530
-Yeah.
-Do it.

1:24:27.630 --> 1:24:28.431
Yeah.

1:24:28.531 --> 1:24:29.665
Come on, guys, that's insane.

1:24:29.765 --> 1:24:32.168
What am I gonna do?
Hop over the divider?

1:24:32.268 --> 1:24:33.702
-Yeah.
-[Margo] I would.

1:24:33.802 --> 1:24:35.904
There's a security guard
right over there.

1:24:37.373 --> 1:24:38.841
All right, we need
a distraction.

1:24:38.941 --> 1:24:40.809
Just tell me the plan and
I'm ready to execute it.

1:24:42.811 --> 1:24:46.382
* Ave

1:24:46.482 --> 1:24:52.555
* Maria

1:24:55.358 --> 1:25:01.330
* Gratia plena

1:25:01.430 --> 1:25:06.101
-His voice!
-It's...beautiful.

1:25:06.202 --> 1:25:07.870
Callie, Callie, look!

1:25:07.970 --> 1:25:11.207
* Gratia plena

1:25:11.307 --> 1:25:12.908
-It's actually working.
-Yeah.

1:25:13.008 --> 1:25:18.714
* Maria, gratia plena

1:25:18.814 --> 1:25:21.384
That's your cue.
Go, go, go.

1:25:22.485 --> 1:25:24.086
Where is she going?

1:25:24.187 --> 1:25:28.056
I've known him for 10 years and
I have never seen him do that.

1:25:28.157 --> 1:25:32.361
* Dominus tecum

1:25:32.461 --> 1:25:38.501
* Bendicta tu in mulieribus

1:25:39.402 --> 1:25:45.241
* Et benedictus

1:25:46.074 --> 1:25:52.047
* Et benedictus
fructus ventris *

1:25:53.148 --> 1:25:55.518
* Ventris tui

1:25:55.618 --> 1:25:57.286
Hey, trust me, Dad, I got
the play you need to run.

1:25:57.386 --> 1:25:59.688
-Callie, what are you doing?
-[Callie] I got this. Trust me.

1:25:59.788 --> 1:26:02.391
Over the past two years, I've
developed an analytics algorithm

1:26:02.491 --> 1:26:04.327
that can determine
the most likely outcome

1:26:04.427 --> 1:26:05.761
of various strategies.

1:26:05.861 --> 1:26:08.731
Long story short,
you do what I tell you,

1:26:08.831 --> 1:26:10.299
you're going to the Super Bowl.

1:26:10.399 --> 1:26:11.934
White board!

1:26:13.001 --> 1:26:14.136
I would listen, Coach.

1:26:14.237 --> 1:26:15.704
You're not really gonna
do that, though, right?

1:26:17.473 --> 1:26:18.941
Let's hear her out.

1:26:19.041 --> 1:26:20.843
Coach?
White board.

1:26:21.877 --> 1:26:23.946
Here you go.

1:26:24.046 --> 1:26:26.014
Huddle up.

1:26:26.982 --> 1:26:28.651
* Can't stop this power,
this flaunt, this pose *

1:26:28.751 --> 1:26:30.519
* This strut, this
look, this style *

1:26:30.619 --> 1:26:32.421
* Come around me,
might get too hot *

1:26:32.521 --> 1:26:34.690
* You go in, but I go out

1:26:34.790 --> 1:26:36.892
* Boss, boss, boss,
boss, boss, boss, boss *

1:26:38.627 --> 1:26:41.096
Dad. Save story time for later!

1:26:41.196 --> 1:26:43.799
Yes, ma'am.

1:26:43.899 --> 1:26:44.700
That's it.

1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:46.269
You guys run it like I laid out,

1:26:46.369 --> 1:26:49.104
my dad's got a 92% chance of
scoring the winning touchdown.

1:26:49.204 --> 1:26:50.973
Okay.

1:26:51.874 --> 1:26:56.845
Gentlemen...this might
cost me my job, but...

1:26:56.945 --> 1:27:00.182
this is a smart play.
We're gonna go with it.

1:27:00.283 --> 1:27:01.784
Game!

1:27:01.884 --> 1:27:03.919
Win on three.
One, two, three--

1:27:04.019 --> 1:27:05.588
[Huddle] Win!

1:27:05.688 --> 1:27:09.258
-Hey, you must lock the middle.
-You got it, Coach.

1:27:12.828 --> 1:27:14.830
This works, you're gonna
get the rushing record.

1:27:14.930 --> 1:27:16.499
Yeah, but without Madden--

1:27:16.599 --> 1:27:20.569
Dad, Dad, you don't need Madden.
You never did.

1:27:22.104 --> 1:27:24.940
[Jim] Strap in, folks!
Here we go!

1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:26.575
Tony?

1:27:26.675 --> 1:27:28.010
[Tony] And Coleman and
Fisher are both on the field

1:27:28.110 --> 1:27:31.013
at the same time in
an unconventional move

1:27:31.113 --> 1:27:33.015
through the final play
to go to the Super Bowl.

1:27:33.115 --> 1:27:35.518
[Jim] There is no more
tense moment than this.

1:27:35.618 --> 1:27:38.287
The entire season, the
trip to the Super Bowl

1:27:38.387 --> 1:27:40.255
on the line right here.

1:27:40.356 --> 1:27:42.124
[Tony] With both of them on
the field at the same time,

1:27:42.224 --> 1:27:44.660
I'm thinking for
something kind of tricky.

1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:46.161
[Jim] Oh, it is tricky.

1:27:46.261 --> 1:27:47.696
It's a direct step to Coleman.

1:27:47.796 --> 1:27:50.966
Around the right side,
he's looking for a gap.

1:27:51.066 --> 1:27:53.736
Go, go, go!

1:27:55.871 --> 1:27:57.606
[Tony] Matthias has broken free.

1:27:57.706 --> 1:27:59.508
He's coming up to
make the tackle.

1:27:59.608 --> 1:28:01.143
[Jim] But look at this!

1:28:01.243 --> 1:28:04.347
Coleman's gonna go across
the field with a lateral.

1:28:04.447 --> 1:28:06.281
He's got Fisher!

1:28:06.382 --> 1:28:09.017
Wait!

1:28:09.117 --> 1:28:10.285
[Jim] On the feet!

1:28:10.386 --> 1:28:13.288
And Anderson Fisher is in!

1:28:13.389 --> 1:28:17.025
The Falcons have won it in
the most improbable of ways!

1:28:17.125 --> 1:28:20.996
And Atlanta is heading
to the Super Bowl!

1:28:21.096 --> 1:28:23.966
[Tony] Bobby Coleman had a
chance at the rushing record

1:28:24.066 --> 1:28:28.070
and chose to get his
team to the Super Bowl.

1:28:28.170 --> 1:28:31.574
That gave me goosebumps
right there, Jim.

1:28:31.674 --> 1:28:35.210
[cheering, grunting]

1:28:39.482 --> 1:28:40.649
Coleman!

1:28:41.984 --> 1:28:43.218
Aah!

1:28:43.318 --> 1:28:46.789
You weren't kidding!
You're a great hugger.

1:28:46.889 --> 1:28:48.924
-It's a heck of a play!
-Yeah.

1:28:49.024 --> 1:28:50.192
You could've beat
my rushing record,

1:28:50.292 --> 1:28:52.227
but you put the team first.

1:28:52.327 --> 1:28:54.096
Look, don't tell nobody but, uh,

1:28:54.196 --> 1:28:55.864
you might be my
favorite player again.

1:28:55.964 --> 1:28:57.299
[laughs]

1:28:59.067 --> 1:29:00.235
Oh, hey!

1:29:00.335 --> 1:29:02.671
Anderson.

1:29:02.771 --> 1:29:04.673
You was right about everything.

1:29:06.475 --> 1:29:09.612
Or...were you?

1:29:11.580 --> 1:29:13.549
[crowd cheering]

1:29:13.649 --> 1:29:15.451
[laughs]

1:29:15.551 --> 1:29:17.920
Uh-uh.

1:29:18.020 --> 1:29:19.688
Coleman!

1:29:19.788 --> 1:29:21.424
Coleman, you can't
leave me like that!

1:29:21.524 --> 1:29:24.693
It was the game.
It was the game!

1:29:24.793 --> 1:29:29.197
[cheering, shouting]

1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:32.735
Yes!

1:29:32.835 --> 1:29:34.002
Okay, now,
that was pretty much

1:29:34.102 --> 1:29:35.170
the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

1:29:35.270 --> 1:29:36.739
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:29:36.839 --> 1:29:39.875
[fireworks whistle and burst]

1:29:41.944 --> 1:29:43.779
Um, hey, in case
you were wondering,

1:29:43.879 --> 1:29:46.715
now would be, like,
the perfect time to kiss me.

1:29:51.654 --> 1:29:53.589
Yes! Yes, yes, I knew it!

1:29:53.689 --> 1:29:59.394
[Callie] Yeah...it was a weird
year, but also kind of the best.

1:29:59.495 --> 1:30:04.266
We ended up getting second
place at the robotics nationals.

1:30:04.366 --> 1:30:06.334
My dad signed a multiyear
deal with the Falcons

1:30:06.435 --> 1:30:07.936
after winning the Super Bowl.

1:30:08.036 --> 1:30:10.205
What's up, Coach?
Not you--other coach.

1:30:10.305 --> 1:30:12.374
[Callie] And I landed a
pretty sweet internship

1:30:12.475 --> 1:30:14.142
doing analytics
for the Falcons.

1:30:14.242 --> 1:30:15.944
My parents have
never been prouder.

1:30:16.044 --> 1:30:17.813
That's right, Callie, you
talk about those numbers!

1:30:17.913 --> 1:30:21.149
-This is it!
-Thank you!

1:30:21.249 --> 1:30:22.651
Or louder .

1:30:22.751 --> 1:30:24.086
Okay...

1:30:24.186 --> 1:30:27.623
[Callie] And this year
for my birthday...

1:30:27.723 --> 1:30:30.959
all my wishes
actually came true.

1:30:31.059 --> 1:30:34.663
For once, there were no
moving boxes in sight.

1:30:34.763 --> 1:30:37.065
Just an actual group of
friends to call my own

1:30:37.165 --> 1:30:40.536
in a city that's starting
to feel like home.

1:30:40.636 --> 1:30:43.772
And I think maybe a boyfriend?

1:30:43.872 --> 1:30:45.641
-Happy birthday, Callie.
-Thank you.

1:30:45.741 --> 1:30:47.142
-Can I get one of those?
-Yes.

1:30:47.242 --> 1:30:48.410
All right, Drake.

1:30:48.511 --> 1:30:50.479
Why don't you move that arm
while you still got one?

1:30:50.579 --> 1:30:52.214
-Dad...
-I'm sorry, Mr. Coleman.

1:30:52.314 --> 1:30:54.382
-You know we--
-Oh, hey, hey, hey.

1:30:54.483 --> 1:30:55.684
We got a big surprise outside.

1:30:55.784 --> 1:30:57.686
Come on, let's go,
everybody outside now.

1:30:57.786 --> 1:30:59.387
Come on!

1:31:06.795 --> 1:31:10.866
* I can feel the
beat in my body *

1:31:10.966 --> 1:31:15.170
* I can feel the rhythm
down to my toes, yeah *

1:31:17.740 --> 1:31:20.242
-Surprise!
-[laughs]

1:31:20.342 --> 1:31:24.112
No way, no freakin' way!

1:31:24.212 --> 1:31:26.949
-It's all yours.
-Oh my god!

1:31:27.049 --> 1:31:28.951
-Okay, who wants a ride?
-Oh, I got the front!

1:31:29.051 --> 1:31:31.820
Hey, hey! Have at it!

1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:35.457
Oh, my goodness.
[laughs]

1:31:38.861 --> 1:31:40.763
[starts car]

1:31:40.863 --> 1:31:47.002
[cheering]

1:31:49.004 --> 1:31:51.640
* We ain't going nowhere
but the top of the world *

1:31:51.740 --> 1:31:54.376
* All right, don't
stop for fools *

1:31:54.476 --> 1:31:58.380
[Callie] Yep, I'd say Atlanta's
the perfect place for us.

1:31:58.480 --> 1:31:59.381
[crowd cheering]

1:31:59.481 --> 1:32:01.249

off my shoulders *

1:32:22.905 --> 1:32:27.075

oh, I wanna show ya *

1:32:31.413 --> 1:32:34.783
* The way I see

of all these lemons *

* Taking what we got
and we make it okay *

can reach out for me *
