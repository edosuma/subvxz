<i> My guest</i>
<i> today has been called</i>

00:36.604 --> 00:39.772
<i> 2002's most promising</i>
<i> first time author,</i>

00:39.774 --> 00:43.042
<i> with his debut book</i>
<i> flying off the shelves.</i>

00:43.044 --> 00:45.611
<i> -Jack Spencer,</i> <i> welcome to our program.
- </i> -It's great to be here.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.312
<i> Best-selling</i>
<i> author Jack Spencer</i>
<i> took five years</i>

00:47.314 --> 00:50.449
<i> to publish</i>
<i> the follow-up to his debut.</i>

00:50.451 --> 00:51.784
<i> Critics</i>
<i> seem to be on the same page.</i>

00:51.786 --> 00:53.619
<i> His overdue sophomore effort</i>

00:53.621 --> 00:56.188
<i> -is exactly that, sophomoric.</i>

00:56.190 --> 00:59.091

<i> happened to that guy bin,"</i>
<i> author Jack Spencer--</i>

00:59.093 --> 01:02.428
<i> finally</i>
<i> released a new book today,</i>
<i> entitled</i> the rhythm wind.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.197
<i> In the la</i>
<i> weekly review of the book,</i>
<i> bostra botten wrote--</i>

01:05.199 --> 01:07.533
<i> the only thing that's clear</i>
<i> is his desire</i>

01:07.535 --> 01:09.768
<i> to land in</i>
<i> the one-hit wonder aisle.</i>

01:09.770 --> 01:12.471
- Daddy!

01:12.473 --> 01:14.139
Hey, munchkins!

01:14.141 --> 01:18.644
Gimme a kiss,
mwah, mwah!

01:18.646 --> 01:21.613
- Hey, where've you been?

01:21.615 --> 01:28.087
Oh, I had to
pack up my office early.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.488
The start-up wanted in Monday,

01:29.490 --> 01:33.092
so, I'll be writing
on our couch now.

01:33.094 --> 01:36.095
I'm sorry, uh,

01:36.097 --> 01:38.664
but can you pretend I'm a call
from your agent next time?

01:38.666 --> 01:41.600
Hmm, an
agent calling me?

01:41.602 --> 01:43.569
Now, my cartwheels!

01:43.571 --> 01:46.672
Ok, I got this,
i got this, here we go.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.573
Go for it.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.141
Do you guys have to leave?

01:49.143 --> 01:51.310
Oh, it's just for
five days, sweetie.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.778
Oh, that was a good one!

01:52.780 --> 01:54.213
Oh, yeah!

01:54.215 --> 01:55.781
Uncle Brad says
that if you don't

01:55.783 --> 01:58.117
get your act together soon,
we should pack up with mommy

01:58.119 --> 02:01.553
-and live with him
when you lose our house.
-Is that true?

02:01.555 --> 02:05.624
No, no, we're just going
on a grown-up vacation

02:05.626 --> 02:07.659
to enjoy each other.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.527
We used to do it all the time.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.463
Why did you stop?

02:13.766 --> 02:16.201
Uh, because
we couldn't bear

02:16.203 --> 02:17.603
to be away from you two!

02:18.639 --> 02:19.571
Jack?

02:19.573 --> 02:20.806
Uncle Brad!

02:20.808 --> 02:21.807
Ladies!

02:21.809 --> 02:23.242
Hey, aunt Erica!

02:23.244 --> 02:24.710
Did you tell the girls--

02:24.712 --> 02:26.879
look, Jack, you guys are
gonna love this place, trust me.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.881
- I wouldn't trust you--
uncle Brad!

02:28.883 --> 02:31.383
Uncle Brad!

02:31.385 --> 02:32.684
Our flight leaves
in two hours.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.154
Can I just pack
your bag for you?

02:35.156 --> 02:37.189
Sure.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.558
How could your brother say
that in front of the girls?

02:39.560 --> 02:43.829
His crib
had lead paint.

02:43.831 --> 02:48.600
Who does that?

02:48.602 --> 02:53.238
Can we please start this
trip with a clean slate?

02:53.940 --> 02:55.307
Ok.

02:56.576 --> 03:01.246
Sorry.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.315
Life moves pretty fast,
if you don't stop

03:03.317 --> 03:05.951
and look around once in
a while, you could miss it.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.220
<i> Breakfast club?</i>

03:08.222 --> 03:10.689
Ooh, close, same director,
a year later.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.258
Uh,<i> Ferris Bueller's day off.</i>

03:13.260 --> 03:15.694
Ding-ding-ding,
ok, your turn.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.931
- Oh, um...

03:18.933 --> 03:20.332
My turn.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.709
This is amazing!

03:30.711 --> 03:32.444
Yeah, amazing.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.946
Come on, silly boy.

03:33.948 --> 03:35.614
I just wish
we brought the girls.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.316
That would
defeat the purpose.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.551
Yeah, right, we
need alone time in the wild

03:39.553 --> 03:41.320
to rekindle our marriage.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.888
You agreed to this.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.391
I know you're gonna graze

03:46.393 --> 03:49.328
in the organic garden and wear
wild flowers in your hair,

03:49.330 --> 03:51.296
but what do you
expect me to do here?

03:51.298 --> 03:55.267
- Relax, roast s'mores.
- -Good times.

03:55.269 --> 03:58.003
A little dancing,
a little night life.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.471
<i> Weird science.</i>

03:59.473 --> 04:00.806
Correct.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.812
Unbelievable!

04:06.814 --> 04:08.614
Did you know
there were animals?

04:08.616 --> 04:10.349
Are we responsible for them?

04:10.351 --> 04:14.519
Relax, honey, it's all part
of this thing called nature.

04:14.521 --> 04:17.488
Oh, nature, interesting.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.524
Let's see, I don't
know what that is.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.426
What is nature?

04:21.428 --> 04:23.962
Well, cell service cut
out about 30 minutes ago,

04:23.964 --> 04:27.466
so welcome back to
the 20th century!

04:28.968 --> 04:30.702
Are you kidding me?

04:30.704 --> 04:32.704
What if the girls need us?

04:32.706 --> 04:35.774
They're fine,
they're with family.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.043
What did our parents
do when they got away?

04:38.045 --> 04:42.748
They would throw Martinis
at each other from
across the room.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.549
- Come on!
- -No, no, no, no, no.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.486
- Come on!
-Be careful, how old is this barn?

04:47.488 --> 04:51.056
Oh, the view
is amazing up here!

04:51.058 --> 04:55.594
- I'm sure it is.
-Oh, it's like a lookout tower, come on up!

04:55.596 --> 04:57.462
No way.

04:57.464 --> 05:01.833
A two-story barn doesn't qualify
for your fear of heights.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.403
Ok.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.439
Hey, there's
a wasp's nest!

05:07.441 --> 05:09.541
Well, it says there's
peppermint chili

05:09.543 --> 05:11.076
wasp repellent in the shed.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.477
Does that work?

05:12.479 --> 05:15.614
Only in the
eco-magical places!

05:15.616 --> 05:18.750
The food outside
is for the alpacas,

05:18.752 --> 05:23.322
and the carrots are
for donkey and yoti.

05:23.324 --> 05:26.591
don quixote, don't you
think they were trying

05:26.593 --> 05:31.430
a little hard with the vinyl
and the typewriter, ugh!

05:31.432 --> 05:34.700
- Mm, oh!

05:34.702 --> 05:37.402
Break it down!

05:37.404 --> 05:40.005
You know that was designed
to blind intruders, right?

05:40.007 --> 05:42.040
What,
you mean the boogey man?

05:42.042 --> 05:44.443
Yeah, look,
i got one, too.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.612
- What is that?
-A bug zapper!

05:47.614 --> 05:50.782
Ooh, you can dance
with that, you know?

05:50.784 --> 05:52.884
--Yes!

05:53.586 --> 05:54.753
Death!

05:55.788 --> 05:58.824
Well, enjoy killing your bugs.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.427
- I'll feed the donkeys.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.971
Can I come and hang with you?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.740
Oh.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.811
Oh, gosh!

06:21.047 --> 06:24.649
Amanda, ok, ok, ok.

06:28.154 --> 06:31.957
- Hey, shorty, yeah!

06:37.131 --> 06:40.932
- Ah, oh god!

06:40.934 --> 06:43.869
Oh god!

06:57.451 --> 06:58.617
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.752
Come meet my friends.

07:00.754 --> 07:06.458
-What happened?
-Oh, just enjoying nature
in a sustainable way.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.029
Tasty, local, natural.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.198
- Ok.
-Look at this guy!

07:14.535 --> 07:15.667
- Eww!

07:15.669 --> 07:17.903
I'm going back to the barn.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.504
See ya!

07:19.506 --> 07:22.174
Hey, look at me,
I'm the ass whisperer!

07:25.779 --> 07:29.047
Ah!

07:48.669 --> 07:50.936
Ooh, ooh, so loud!

07:50.938 --> 07:52.671
You're so rude!

07:52.673 --> 07:53.972
You're adorable.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.177
I'm takin' a look
inside this shed.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.112
Be careful!

08:10.691 --> 08:11.723
Oh, there it is.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.927
Jeez, jumpy much?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.162
Well, I am in a shed

08:17.164 --> 08:20.632
in the middle of Texas
with a chainsaw!

08:20.634 --> 08:22.033
I don't think you
can be massacred,

08:22.035 --> 08:24.102
all the tools look green.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.837
Yeah, it doesn't
chop the trees down,

08:25.839 --> 08:27.906
-it just hugs 'em.
-Mm-hmm.

08:31.110 --> 08:34.044
Everything's gonna be all right.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.914
I just want things to
start going my way again.

08:36.917 --> 08:40.585
You have two beautiful daughters
and me going your way,

08:40.587 --> 08:44.022
so I don't know
what else you want.

08:44.024 --> 08:48.159
I don't know,
organic shed sex?

08:49.161 --> 08:50.862
Are you serious?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.531
No, I was joking, but...

08:55.135 --> 08:57.536
But, wait, wait, wait,
are you serious?

08:57.538 --> 09:01.740
I did... I love the idea
of organic shed sex!

09:06.580 --> 09:07.712
What?

09:09.849 --> 09:12.751
I'm just waiting for
Michael Myers to jump out.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.787
Kill!

09:15.789 --> 09:18.089
You mean Jason, Jason
was the one at the camp.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.992
Michael Myers
is from the 'burbs.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.694
Well, that's comforting.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.170
Did you ever think we'd be here?

09:32.172 --> 09:34.339
Alone on a farm?

09:34.341 --> 09:36.641
What I'm saying is
for us to come out here

09:36.643 --> 09:38.109
while our friends
and family back home

09:38.111 --> 09:42.013
are praying that we make a 180,

09:42.015 --> 09:44.916
hoping that it's not too late.

09:55.895 --> 10:00.098
It was my idea for me and
the girls to move in with Brad.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.233
What?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.035
I mean, it's not a done deal,

10:04.037 --> 10:07.639
it's just a back-up plan
in case.

10:07.641 --> 10:12.110
In case I don't magically
change under the stars at night.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.184
You know, I am trying.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.919
Trying what?

10:34.868 --> 10:37.335
Just leave it be, you don't
need to lock it out here.

10:37.337 --> 10:41.873
- I need to lock it.

10:41.875 --> 10:45.410
I can't believe you
got my wedding pajamas out!

10:45.412 --> 10:47.812
I haven't seen
these since Aspen.

10:47.814 --> 10:53.652
Mm, it's a vacation.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.888
You're not trying to poison me
with iocane powder are you?

10:56.890 --> 11:00.191
Inconceivable!

11:03.363 --> 11:06.231
Oh!

11:08.901 --> 11:10.201
Throwback Thursday!

11:10.203 --> 11:14.406
That's...

11:29.322 --> 11:31.690
This is it.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.324
We used to go up
on my mom's roof,

11:33.326 --> 11:34.926
and we'd bring out speakers,

11:34.928 --> 11:38.463
and we'd listen to kroq,
volume full blast.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.898
On the roof?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.900
- Yes, absolutely!

11:41.902 --> 11:45.036
We'd stay up there for hours.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.940
We'd listen to
Richard blade,

11:48.942 --> 11:52.277
and he'd play the smiths
and tears for fears.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.045
Depeche mode.

11:54.047 --> 11:58.116
Yeah, but we were
more into new order

11:58.118 --> 12:00.485
-because you had to pick a side.
-Oh.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.188
You couldn't like both.

12:03.190 --> 12:08.727
Mike wanted to be a drummer,
Dave, a professional surfer,

12:08.729 --> 12:11.296
and I wanted to
be a great writer.

12:11.298 --> 12:15.767
Mm.

12:15.769 --> 12:22.207
I used to wanna play so badly,
and I did play so badly.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.815
-Sing me a song.
-I can't sing.

12:30.817 --> 12:35.420
Mm, come on, it can't be
something from the '80s.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.888
No to the way.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.825
You sang
for me at our wedding.

12:40.827 --> 12:45.029
I was drunk.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.439
Ok, so, um...

12:54.441 --> 12:58.877
You were on your rooftop
new wave club.

12:58.879 --> 13:03.348
I just wanna go back
and tell that kid,

13:03.350 --> 13:08.419
"hey, go to business school,
study software.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.523
"Just learn how
to build an app."

13:13.392 --> 13:16.094
And break up with Julie cook,

13:16.096 --> 13:19.330
'cause you're gonna meet
this hot girl in college.

13:19.332 --> 13:23.034
That's right, and then you'll
have to dump that hot girl,

13:23.036 --> 13:24.435
because you're gonna
meet your wife.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.172
- That's not... thanks!

13:27.174 --> 13:28.907
What, that's me being funny!

13:28.909 --> 13:30.575
That's not funny.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.545
- It's not?
-Mm-mm.

13:33.547 --> 13:37.282
You should take the teaching
job, I mean, just for a season.

13:37.284 --> 13:41.386
I know it's not a lotta money,
but you could cover
the girls' tuition.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.825
I think that you
would have a lot

13:46.827 --> 13:50.395
of great things to
say to the students.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.132
Yeah, like, "quit now,

13:54.134 --> 13:57.569
before all your
dreams are crushed."

14:11.217 --> 14:14.552
This changes my whole
position on gun control.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.421
Why?

14:16.423 --> 14:20.024
Because living out here,
you'd have to be packing.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.428
I mean, rattlesnakes
and wild hogs,

14:23.430 --> 14:25.463
insane asylum escapees.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.900
I don't think we're
anywhere near any asylums

14:28.902 --> 14:34.072
or madhouses or
Indian burial grounds,

14:35.608 --> 14:40.078
though I bet there's a
prison somewhere nearby.

14:41.146 --> 14:43.147
You had to say that.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.657
Did you hear that?

14:54.527 --> 14:56.628
-Yes.
-Yes?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.427
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

15:29.429 --> 15:32.397
-We rented this place.
-So did we!

15:32.399 --> 15:33.631
Are you ok?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.700
Nate must've double-booked us.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.469
-Nate?
-He owns this place.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.972
Yeah, he rented it to us.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.473
Well, he rented it to us, too.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.574
- Hey, hey!

15:43.576 --> 15:44.943
- Oh my god!

15:44.945 --> 15:48.947
-Stop!
-Ok, are you cool?

15:48.949 --> 15:51.082
Let's sleep on it and we'll
figure it out in the morning.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.350
- Yeah.
-The morning?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.218
Dude, you
seriously injured me.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.153
He's hurt.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.587
Yeah, my head hurts.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.257
I'm sure you could
sleep in the airstream.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.492
Yeah, or, or the yurt,
it's a tent--

16:01.494 --> 16:03.528
we know what a yurt is.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.330
Yeah, I gotta lay down.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.999
Yeah, we can just crash here.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.734
We won't bother
you guys back there.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.636
Ok babe, come sit down.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.173
- He's a maniac.
-I know, it's ok, it's ok.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.175
There you go, it's ok.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.344
- Ok?
- -I can't believe they did that to you!

16:19.346 --> 16:21.412
I'll make you feel
better, I promise--

16:21.414 --> 16:23.681
- you'll make me
feel better?

16:32.625 --> 16:35.259
Why's the trailer shaking?

16:35.261 --> 16:38.262
Good thing for them
you don't have the gun.

16:41.401 --> 16:46.104
- Oh, god!

17:11.262 --> 17:12.463
What's that smell?

17:17.603 --> 17:18.669
Oh.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.804
Hey!

17:19.806 --> 17:21.772
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey!

17:21.775 --> 17:22.773
Coffee?

17:22.776 --> 17:26.109
Uh... thank you.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.780
Mm-hmm, here you go.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.449
Do you have any cream or--

17:31.451 --> 17:33.518
it doesn't need it.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.622
This is a finca herbazu,
it's a shade-grown pacamara.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.058
-Ooh.
-Yeah, you guys
are gonna dig it.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.060
It's got a primary note
of exotic fruits,

17:42.062 --> 17:45.263
little suggestion of
maple syrup and praline.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.664
Please?

17:46.666 --> 17:49.300
Oh, ok.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.335
You guys
are going to love it!

17:51.337 --> 17:53.104
So tasty!

17:53.106 --> 17:57.642
- I call this eggs bacondict.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.578
Uh, I don't do bacon.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.814
Mm, health or ethics?

18:03.382 --> 18:04.782
Pet.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.251
Pet, you, you got a pet pig?

18:07.253 --> 18:08.653
Oh, I want one!

18:08.655 --> 18:10.655
You grew up on a farm?

18:10.657 --> 18:13.091
Condo, actually.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.326
I wanted
a German Shepherd,

18:15.328 --> 18:21.499
my mom wanted a hypoallergenic
pet, so I got wilbur.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.733
Yep, say no more.

18:22.735 --> 18:27.538
You know what,
here, I got an idea.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.509
Let's just take and put
this on my plate, no bacon.

18:31.511 --> 18:35.580
Here ya go, a killer
abealicious Kale smoothie.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.883
Uh, yeah, um.

18:38.885 --> 18:42.420
I'm not vegetarian,
i just don't eat pork.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.289
Hmm, thank you.

18:49.461 --> 18:53.564
So, where you guys from,
lemme guess, the oc.

18:53.566 --> 18:57.502
- The bay area.

18:57.504 --> 19:01.205
Oh, my god,
i love the bay area!

19:01.207 --> 19:04.675
It's got, uh, blue bottle,
tacolicious.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.278
Abe knows all
the coolest spots.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.580
He's a programmer with
over 1000 followers.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.783
His feed was featured last
summer, that's how we met.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.823
So what brings you guys here?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.759
Extended honeymoon,
leading up to the reception.

19:21.761 --> 19:27.832
-Yeah, it's elope now,
party later, right, baby?
-It's the new rage.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.301
What about you cats,
how long you guys been married?

19:30.303 --> 19:31.602
14 years.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.305
15 years.

19:34.307 --> 19:37.808
Wow, congratulations, that's--

19:37.810 --> 19:40.678
-a long time!
-It's a long time, yeah, wow.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.714
-It's awesome.
-That's great.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.583
Mm.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.519
So is this, like, an
anniversary thing for you guys?

19:48.521 --> 19:52.490
No, no, it's a
private retreat.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.527
That was a little harsh.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.530
We made you breakfast.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.633
We made you smoothies.

20:02.635 --> 20:06.571
You know, and juice, coffee.

20:06.573 --> 20:10.208
I don't appreciate that, and
i think that's really mean.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.843
-We could take the yurt.
-No, wh--

20:12.845 --> 20:16.214
really, oh, that is so ni--
oh my goodness.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.381
Thank you guys so much!

20:17.383 --> 20:18.749
That's so nice of you!

20:18.751 --> 20:21.352
That's so
amazing, oh my gosh!

20:21.354 --> 20:25.489
- Oh, my god!
- -Oh, my gosh!

20:25.491 --> 20:28.993
Besides, you guys look
totally made for glamping.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.229
Y'know, glam camping!

20:31.231 --> 20:33.831
Glamping, is that,
like, a thing?

20:33.833 --> 20:35.366
Totally.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.834
We keep doing that!

20:36.836 --> 20:38.502
It's too much, stop!

20:38.504 --> 20:40.004
I don't wanna stop.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.306
It... it's settled then.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.709
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

20:44.711 --> 20:48.279
Well, I'm gonna get you some
milk then for your coffee.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.281
It doesn't need it.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.853
He just misses wilbur.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.756
That's some pig.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.584
Naughty!

21:27.319 --> 21:29.987
Oh!

22:07.493 --> 22:08.859
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:08.861 --> 22:11.762
-Freeze!
-You coulda killed me!

22:11.764 --> 22:14.665
Are you a native, originating
or occurring naturally

22:14.667 --> 22:16.567
in the wilds of Texas?

22:16.569 --> 22:19.603
No, I'm Jack from California.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.072
Hands up!

22:21.074 --> 22:22.773
Ok, easy, boy scout!

22:22.775 --> 22:24.442
I'm not a scout,

22:24.444 --> 22:27.845
I'm a seventh-year
baron academy Griffin.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.880
Are you alone out here,
don't you have a parent

22:29.882 --> 22:32.416
or the buddy system?

22:32.418 --> 22:33.551
Even talking with you puts me

22:33.553 --> 22:35.586
in jeopardy of badge debarment.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.422
Ok, well, then,
I'll just leave now, ok?

22:38.424 --> 22:41.926
-It's too late for that.
-What?

22:41.928 --> 22:44.628
So we met up at the
gathering in Portland,

22:44.630 --> 22:47.098
and three months
later, we're hitched!

22:47.100 --> 22:48.599
- That's wild.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.634
They always say, when
you know, you know!

22:50.636 --> 22:51.869
- I guess.

22:58.478 --> 23:01.045
-Here he is!
-Who?

23:01.047 --> 23:02.813
Nate cortes.

23:02.815 --> 23:06.684
The owner, how do
you know what he looks like?

23:09.622 --> 23:12.390
Hey, welcome to green acres.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.393
The welcome is, is all mine!

23:15.395 --> 23:18.129
I, welcome to green acres!

23:18.131 --> 23:22.500
I, I didn't know you
were gonna be here, well,

23:22.502 --> 23:25.970
welcome home, it's,
sorry, it's,

23:25.972 --> 23:28.706
it's so nice, nice to meet you.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.875
I just wanted to say that I, um,

23:30.877 --> 23:33.677
I do my best to be green
and I love everything

23:33.679 --> 23:35.579
eco-friendly that
you've done here.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.549
Yeah, you must be Amanda.

23:38.551 --> 23:43.587
Yeah, why, yes,
i think I am.

23:44.856 --> 23:46.457
And Jamie?

23:46.459 --> 23:48.926
-Yeah.
-So how's the yurt?

23:48.928 --> 23:52.663
Yes, um, they actually
wanted the yurt,

23:52.665 --> 23:55.766
so we're cool in the spartan.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.869
We'll, um, we'll, we'll
take the yurt tonight,

23:58.871 --> 24:02.139
and maybe just a discount
for the difference.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.008
Nah, I'll do you one better.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.644
A night free, on the house.

24:06.646 --> 24:10.714
Thank you, but my kids, so.

24:10.716 --> 24:13.984
We would be open
to staying longer.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.152
Possibly.

24:16.621 --> 24:21.025
So, uh, you all
like a tour of the land?

24:21.827 --> 24:22.726
Yes.

25:44.075 --> 25:46.677
Bowhunting badge, knot badge,

25:46.679 --> 25:50.180
shelter badge, should get
my fire badge tonight,

25:50.182 --> 25:52.182
all in two moons, no help.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.885
We teach ourselves,
the students are in charge.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.888
Kill the pig, spill his blood!

25:57.890 --> 26:01.792
Ironically, my last task
is to capture a wild hog.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.060
You're kidding me.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.995
Nope, have
to trap it alive.

26:04.997 --> 26:09.133
-All by yourself?
-Yeah, no help,
no teachers, no homework.

26:09.135 --> 26:13.037
-Wow.
-Our academy is like
the best of socrates,

26:13.039 --> 26:15.005
boy scouts, and
Google put together.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.641
Well, that's quite a mash-up.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.109
Do you have kids in school?

26:19.111 --> 26:21.312
Yeah, two, here.

26:21.314 --> 26:23.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:24.350 --> 26:26.250
Whoa, no, no, no,
pictures,

26:26.252 --> 26:30.287
just my phone, here.
Here.

26:32.657 --> 26:35.092
Yeah, look at their pictures.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.796
-Molly and Caroline.
<i> -Uncle Brad says that if...</i>

26:38.798 --> 26:41.265
No, no, no, no, not that one.
Not that one.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.800
<i> ...pack up with</i>
<i> mommy and live with him</i>

26:42.802 --> 26:43.934
<i> when you lose our house.</i>

26:43.936 --> 26:46.770
Ok, that's enough.

26:46.772 --> 26:47.905
Thanks.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.242
They're cute.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.912
Yeah, one of their many
outstanding qualities.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.819
You in the shit?

27:01.821 --> 27:05.122
Yeah, deep, just
tryin' to climb out.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.890
You've crossed the threshold,

27:06.892 --> 27:08.158
in the belly of the whale,

27:08.160 --> 27:11.095
headed into the road of trials.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.863
Do you have a smart goal?

27:12.865 --> 27:16.867
-Maybe.
-S-m-a-r-t, specific,
measurable, achievable,

27:16.869 --> 27:18.769
realistic, and time-bound.

27:18.771 --> 27:21.171
Huh, that I do not.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.873
You should.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.909
What do you think my
smart goal should be?

27:25.911 --> 27:27.911
What do you think?

27:27.913 --> 27:29.380
I'm not gonna tell you
how to get your wife

27:29.382 --> 27:31.649
and keep your girls!

27:31.651 --> 27:34.652
That's right,
no teachers, no answers.

27:34.654 --> 27:38.956
- Only guides.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.659
We've talked too much,

27:41.661 --> 27:43.293
I can't take the risk
with the council.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.429
Whoa, dude, dude, dude, dude!

27:45.431 --> 27:48.032
Speak of this to no one.

27:48.034 --> 27:51.835
Well, your hero's journey
is safe with me.

27:53.406 --> 27:55.039
Shake on it.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.340
Is that necessary?

28:14.826 --> 28:16.827
Lemme guess, you got tied up?

28:16.829 --> 28:18.896
Funny you should say that.

28:18.898 --> 28:22.166
- I ran into--
-a better attitude?

28:23.268 --> 28:25.803
Of course.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.806
I went into the woods
to live deliberately,

28:28.808 --> 28:33.077
live deep, and suck
the marrow out of life!

28:33.079 --> 28:35.746
To live so sturdily
and spartan-like

28:35.748 --> 28:38.882
as to put to rout all
that was not life,

28:38.884 --> 28:41.218
to drive life into the corner

28:41.220 --> 28:45.055
and reduce it to
its lowest terms.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.223
Hello, Thoreau.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.825
Hello, Tarzan.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.461
That's Nate.

28:50.463 --> 28:53.964
Welcome to my homestead.

28:53.966 --> 28:56.734
I'm gonna just go
back to the tent.

28:56.736 --> 28:59.036
It's a yurt.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.773
Well, aren't you two in sync!

29:05.010 --> 29:09.513
Woo-hoo!

29:09.515 --> 29:10.948
C'mon, dude!

29:10.950 --> 29:13.784
What the hell is that?

29:13.786 --> 29:15.953
They're here!

29:15.955 --> 29:19.523
Amanda, Nate, Jack,
come meet our wedding party!

29:26.765 --> 29:30.334
We are getting
out of here tonight!

29:30.336 --> 29:31.869
To go where?

29:32.437 --> 29:34.404
Anywhere but here.

29:44.250 --> 29:49.987
-So you guys have a goal?
-Yeah, we have a goal,
I'm like hashtag campvibes.

29:49.989 --> 29:53.390
This is fun, you're
having your reception here?

29:53.392 --> 29:55.959
Oh, no, it's not like a
wedding party like that.

29:55.961 --> 30:00.030
It's just like a hang
since we got married alone.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.899
This is my main man
here, Jordan.

30:01.901 --> 30:05.169
He's my brochada, made the
trek in with Ana the vanna.

30:05.171 --> 30:09.039
She's my vannagram,
a photobooth on wheels.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.274
Lucky man!

30:10.276 --> 30:11.875
So I've been told.

30:11.877 --> 30:14.111
Hey, guys, hey, Jack.

30:14.113 --> 30:16.547
We weren't properly introduced.

30:16.549 --> 30:18.282
Ever since I was
looking down on you,

30:18.284 --> 30:21.318
I kept thinking, you look
incredibly familiar to me.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.353
Oh, well,

30:23.355 --> 30:28.025
some people think I look
like Harrison Ford.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.428
Uh, laugh it up, fuzzball!

30:33.599 --> 30:36.900
It's a
game we play, uh.

30:36.902 --> 30:40.170
<i> -Empire strikes back.</i>
<i> -Empire strikes back.</i>

30:44.376 --> 30:46.376
Uh, you're not gonna get
any reception out here.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.413
- Archive, bro!

30:49.415 --> 30:50.414
Come on!

30:50.416 --> 30:52.049
- Oh, ok.

30:52.051 --> 30:56.453
- Over here, over here, Jack!

30:57.422 --> 30:59.089
Glamping!

31:16.876 --> 31:18.075
All right, I'm not kidding,

31:18.077 --> 31:20.577
you look remarkably
familiar to me.

31:20.579 --> 31:23.146
I don't know,
i don't know what to say.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.281
I know.

31:27.252 --> 31:31.421
W-w-wait, are you
Jack Spencer, the author?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.224
Yeah.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.527
I knew it, I knew it!

31:37.529 --> 31:38.462
I didn't tell him!

31:38.464 --> 31:40.063
I'm a huge fan, man!

31:40.065 --> 31:42.099
Why didn't you tell me before?

31:42.101 --> 31:44.568
-Uh--
-so he's a, you're a,
you're a famous writer?

31:44.570 --> 31:46.136
That's, that's awesome!

31:46.138 --> 31:49.606
That's fantastic!

31:49.608 --> 31:53.577
Hey, hey, d-do, do you skate?

31:53.579 --> 31:55.612
-No.
-Come on, man, we gotta
hit that later, man.

31:55.614 --> 31:58.649
You, you said it,
never be motivated

31:58.651 --> 32:02.252
by fear, comfort,
or fame, right?

32:02.254 --> 32:03.186
Right.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.121
Right?

32:04.123 --> 32:05.622
Did you write that?

32:05.624 --> 32:07.925
A long time ago.

32:07.927 --> 32:08.659
That's good.

32:08.661 --> 32:12.262
Oh, it's good!

32:12.264 --> 32:15.065
All right, you guys relax,
i-i have to finish

32:15.067 --> 32:17.234
a reclaimed pallet bench
and some pickling.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.136
Hey, I'll let you try
some of my famous pickles.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.271
And, and your ginger kombucha.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.706
Yeah, yeah,
that's, that's right.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.943
I, uh, I ran out for
the season, but, uh,

32:25.945 --> 32:28.645
we'll gather later tonight,
have a good time, all right?

32:28.647 --> 32:30.347
Yeah, sounds great.

32:30.349 --> 32:34.651
Jack Spencer!

32:34.653 --> 32:36.586
- Oh, god!

32:36.588 --> 32:38.221
Kombucha?

32:38.223 --> 32:41.024
Eh, I read about it
on the website or,

32:41.026 --> 32:43.393
or Facebook or something.

32:43.395 --> 32:47.064
You're Facebook friends?

32:47.066 --> 32:51.001
Eh, that's how he
gives directions.

32:51.003 --> 32:55.539
-Wow, ok.
-You guys still use Facebook?

32:55.541 --> 32:57.407
I do not.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.576
- Good move.
-Yeah.

33:05.116 --> 33:06.216
Too bad
there's no signal

33:06.218 --> 33:08.719
to check your status updates.

34:12.683 --> 34:16.219
- Brave, strong, no fear.

34:22.260 --> 34:23.493
Fire badge!

34:36.641 --> 34:37.808
Suck!

34:38.810 --> 34:40.543
- All right!

34:40.545 --> 34:42.679
Who wants another
green acres mule?

34:42.681 --> 34:44.447
Thought you'd never ask.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.315
Are you sure, Jack?

34:46.318 --> 34:49.453
Oh, don't panic, it's organic!

34:49.455 --> 34:53.156
Full disclosure, Jack,
i loved your book.

34:53.158 --> 34:57.294
- Oh, wait, it changed my life!

34:57.296 --> 34:59.229
Really?

34:59.231 --> 35:05.402
You know, I was in a pretty
dark place a few years back

35:05.404 --> 35:07.437
when I was stumbling through
the self-help section

35:07.439 --> 35:10.173
at book people in Austin.

35:10.175 --> 35:13.577
All of sudden, boom,
there you were.

35:15.346 --> 35:19.316
-There I was.
-Yep, there you were,
smiling at me

35:19.318 --> 35:23.186
from the back of your book,
lying face down
in the dollar bin.

35:23.188 --> 35:27.724
And I grabbed it,
started reading it
right there in the aisle.

35:27.726 --> 35:30.760
Far better it is to
dare mighty things,

35:30.762 --> 35:34.364
to win glorious triumphs, even
though checkered by failure,

35:34.366 --> 35:37.134
than to take rank
with those poor spirits

35:37.136 --> 35:39.436
who neither enjoy much
nor suffer much,

35:39.438 --> 35:41.738
because they live in
the great twilight

35:41.740 --> 35:44.474
that knows neither
victory nor defeat.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.677
-That's incredible!
-I didn't actually write that.

35:47.679 --> 35:51.181
You quoted it, right there,
at the start of chapter one.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.682
Who wrote it then?

35:52.684 --> 35:54.184
Theodore Roosevelt.

35:54.186 --> 35:57.387
Yep, good ol' Teddy!

35:57.389 --> 35:59.723
-Coincidence?
-Inspiring!

36:02.461 --> 36:04.895
So what are you
working on now?

36:04.897 --> 36:08.565
This drink and residing
in the great twilight.

36:08.567 --> 36:09.733
Jack?

36:10.835 --> 36:11.902
What?

36:11.904 --> 36:13.537
You should keep writing.

36:13.539 --> 36:18.275
Oh, I do.
I have been. Trivia question:

36:20.178 --> 36:23.880
Name one other book of mine
from the last 15 years.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.483
-Nobody?
-No bars, bro.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.251
Well, there were
three, actually,

36:28.253 --> 36:29.953
but the truth of the matter is,

36:29.955 --> 36:32.255
the checkered failures
will beat you down

36:32.257 --> 36:34.291
into the great twilight
until you don't

36:34.293 --> 36:36.526
have the strength
to get back up again.

36:40.532 --> 36:44.834
You're really wreckin'
the vibe here.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.770
That comin' from a guy
who can only read

36:46.772 --> 36:48.905
140 characters at a time.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.640
Easy, Hemingway.

36:50.642 --> 36:51.975
Oh, I'm sorry, am I old man

36:51.977 --> 36:55.245
photobombing your
millennial selfie stick?

36:55.247 --> 36:56.546
It's a dreamcatcher.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.881
Really?

36:57.883 --> 37:01.518
Looks like your hashtag
bullshit antenna.

37:01.520 --> 37:05.288
-I keep a journal!
-Aw.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.691
That's great.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.492
And she takes
inspired pictures

37:09.494 --> 37:13.797
and she posts them on tumblr,
and they reflect each entry,

37:13.799 --> 37:15.699
and I just think that
that's really sweet.

37:15.701 --> 37:18.235
Oh, you're sweet.

37:18.237 --> 37:19.803
You're sweet.

37:19.805 --> 37:23.573
Self-distribution.

37:23.575 --> 37:28.278
-What?
-No offense, but it's
just crazy how self-exposed

37:28.280 --> 37:29.946
the whole world is right now.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.848
You know, maybe I should
just post pictures

37:31.850 --> 37:36.786
from everything in my man bag
and release the story online,

37:36.788 --> 37:38.555
one sentence at a time.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.024
It's not a bad idea, mate.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.692
Mate?

37:42.694 --> 37:44.894
He means dude.

37:44.896 --> 37:48.898
All right, all right, who's up
for some rocks and s'mores?

37:48.900 --> 37:50.500
Yes, please!

38:06.817 --> 38:08.018
- Oh, man!

38:08.020 --> 38:09.686
Bravo!

38:09.688 --> 38:13.590
Spotify that shit when
i get a signal, man!

38:13.592 --> 38:14.791
Does your whole life

38:14.793 --> 38:16.760
revolve around ones and zeroes?

38:16.762 --> 38:18.795
All right, Jack, why don't
you just finish your story.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.798
Thank you, so we were
both off at college,

38:21.800 --> 38:24.034
and I was going away
for some summer program,

38:24.036 --> 38:27.837
but Amanda was coming
home from volunteering

38:27.839 --> 38:31.641
with, wait for it,
mother Theresa.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.444
And, that's enough.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.912
That's incredible!

38:35.914 --> 38:37.380
I'd really like to know more

38:37.382 --> 38:39.949
about that later, if that's ok?

38:39.951 --> 38:42.719
He really didn't need
to tell this story.

38:42.721 --> 38:46.523
Come on, honey,
this is romantic!

38:46.525 --> 38:49.426
There are not tweets
or toots or instagrams

38:49.428 --> 38:52.062
of her caring for a dying leper.

38:52.064 --> 38:54.998
You know,
no Facebook posts about,

38:55.000 --> 39:01.705
"look how awesome I am,
me and mama f'n t!"

39:01.707 --> 39:04.574
I-I'm just wonderin'
if you flutterbugs

39:04.576 --> 39:09.846
could, uh, conceive
doing something so amazing

39:09.848 --> 39:13.049
and not broadcasting it,
you know?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.753
She didn't, uh, do any of that.

39:16.755 --> 39:20.857
She did it for herself
and for them.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.927
-Isn't that why you write?
-Not anymore.

39:23.929 --> 39:27.497
No, see, when you're an adult,
you need an audience.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.366
It's not just enough being you.

39:29.368 --> 39:30.900
You gotta dial down
the self-pity,

39:30.902 --> 39:33.837
and let that woe is me
shtick go, man!

39:33.839 --> 39:37.907
If I had a woman like miss
Amanda U.S.A. over here,

39:37.909 --> 39:41.611
-i would never leave the house.
-Thank you, Jordan.

39:41.613 --> 39:45.515
Yeah, thank you, Jordan,
it was really creepy.

39:45.517 --> 39:48.051
You need to spend a beat
with Mr. green acres over here.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.420
He's got it dialed-in,
living off the land.

39:50.422 --> 39:52.589
First dude on the
scene of a disaster.

39:52.591 --> 39:53.890
Ok, that's
all right, thanks--

39:53.892 --> 39:56.593
Katrina and Haiti, right?

39:57.161 --> 39:58.561
Yes.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.063
You the man!

40:00.065 --> 40:02.599
How does everybody know
everything about Nate?

40:02.601 --> 40:06.736
I've been to his bio, this
man's stats are on fleek!

40:06.738 --> 40:08.671
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

40:08.673 --> 40:11.775
We're all very cyber-impressed.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.411
Wh, where are you going?

40:14.413 --> 40:16.646
To the big potty in the woods,

40:16.648 --> 40:20.517
because I'm so organic
and fair trade.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.419
The bath house is
right over there.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.654
Eh, the woods are
right over there,

40:24.656 --> 40:27.824
and I have to say hello
to my little friend.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.626
Don't snapchat that.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.429
No signal, bro!

40:51.049 --> 40:53.516
Oh, man, are you ok?

40:53.518 --> 40:56.986
Just gimme a second.

40:56.988 --> 41:01.691
You should always
throw with the blade first.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.632
Shit, uh, sorry, shoot.

41:12.169 --> 41:16.573
If at first you don't
succeed, try, try again.

41:19.043 --> 41:20.643
--Yes!

41:20.645 --> 41:21.845
-Whoa!
-That's what I'm talkin' about.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.046
-Whoa!
-Woo, whoa!

41:23.048 --> 41:24.747
--Oh!

41:24.749 --> 41:28.251
Are you ok? Oh, man, leaves of
three, let them be.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.686
Poison Ivy?

41:29.688 --> 41:31.554
That's gonna
itch like a mother.

41:31.556 --> 41:32.689
You better pee on it.

41:32.691 --> 41:34.057
Uh, I'm fine.

41:34.059 --> 41:36.793
Remember, it has
to be your own urine.

41:36.795 --> 41:40.497
I promise not to
take someone else's.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.131
- I'll miss you.
-It's lovely to see you.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.502
It was a pleasure meeting you.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.871
When you get tired of Mr.
one hit wonder over there,

41:47.873 --> 41:51.841
find me on insta,
whoisjordaddy24.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.543
- Ooh, that's a good one.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.512
- Yeah.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.814
Namaste, honored to
know you, my man.

41:57.816 --> 41:58.815
All right, brother.

41:58.817 --> 42:00.283
-Bye, Jordan.
-Woo!

42:00.285 --> 42:02.552
I think it's time
we go in for a bit.

42:02.554 --> 42:03.520
Thank you for everything.

42:03.522 --> 42:05.555
I'm here to serve.

42:07.993 --> 42:11.194
- Well--
-oh, no, no, please.

42:14.566 --> 42:16.199
Sun's still out.

42:21.573 --> 42:23.907
How's your mission?

42:23.909 --> 42:27.277
Well, I'm starting
with my sad goals,

42:28.112 --> 42:30.213
stupid ass decisions.

42:31.649 --> 42:33.816
How is that
working out for you?

42:33.818 --> 42:37.253
Honestly, it's not
going very well.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.689
I'm guessing it took years.

42:39.691 --> 42:44.127
Small choices plus time, erosion
doesn't happen overnight.

42:44.795 --> 42:47.630
True, true.

42:47.632 --> 42:51.634
Motivated actions,
not words.

42:51.636 --> 42:53.269
Are you tryin' to teach me?

42:53.271 --> 42:55.638
Guide.

42:55.640 --> 42:59.943
Consider the difference between
erosion and fermentation.

42:59.945 --> 43:02.278
Time can also change
things for the better,

43:02.280 --> 43:04.814
if there's an intentional plan.

43:04.816 --> 43:08.051
Cheese, pickles, yogurt.

43:09.954 --> 43:12.689
- Wine.

43:39.049 --> 43:42.385
Wow, I wish I spoke Spanish.

43:42.387 --> 43:44.854
Me, too.

43:44.856 --> 43:47.390
I just know it in songs.

43:54.733 --> 43:58.134
Here's a good one, here.

43:58.136 --> 44:00.269
-Oh!
-It's nice and easy.

44:00.271 --> 44:04.107
A little, that,
that's plenty, that's good.

44:04.109 --> 44:05.241
Thank you.

44:08.912 --> 44:12.749
So tell me, this, uh,
this mother Theresa thing.

44:12.751 --> 44:17.020
-I mean, you, you were there?
-Well, she wasn't
actually there

44:17.022 --> 44:20.690
when I volunteered with
the sisters of charity.

44:20.692 --> 44:23.292
Come on,
it's better that way,

44:23.294 --> 44:26.929
just pure motivation.

44:26.931 --> 44:28.798
Well, it sounds
like you've had

44:28.800 --> 44:30.933
your share of pure motives.

44:30.935 --> 44:32.368
Well, it sounds
like you've been doing

44:32.370 --> 44:33.870
some research on me.

44:33.872 --> 44:37.373
- No, no, I just--
-huh?

44:37.375 --> 44:38.841
I just read about
it on the site.

44:38.843 --> 44:39.976
All right, whatever.

44:39.978 --> 44:42.779
- The green acres.
-Yeah.

44:42.781 --> 44:46.983
Ah, I used to
be pretty self-absorbed.

44:46.985 --> 44:49.919
You know, it really did
start with Jack's book.

44:49.921 --> 44:51.087
Hmm.

44:51.089 --> 44:54.290
I sold everything
to live simply.

44:54.292 --> 44:57.827
I spent most of my time
in places like these,

44:57.829 --> 45:01.898
out in the wild,
with few possessions,

45:01.900 --> 45:05.702
just focusing on sustainability.

45:05.704 --> 45:08.838
It makes it easy to help
when the need arises.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.007
It's just you out here?

45:11.009 --> 45:13.209
Yeah, yeah, for now.

45:13.211 --> 45:15.445
That's why I started
renting the place out.

45:15.447 --> 45:17.313
It needs to be shared.

45:17.315 --> 45:20.483
That's so inspiring.

45:20.485 --> 45:25.388
It can be, yet surprisingly
isolating as well.

45:29.294 --> 45:31.761
Oh, it's getting late.

45:32.229 --> 45:34.063
Yeah.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.232
Hey, let me show
you a, a quick trick

45:36.234 --> 45:41.037
with the fan in the yurt,
so you can stay cool.

45:41.039 --> 45:43.740
- Sure, thanks.

45:43.742 --> 45:45.775
Do you have anything to drink?

45:45.777 --> 45:47.477
Yeah, I have some water.

45:47.479 --> 45:51.013
- No, no, you don't have any alcohol?
- -Nope.

45:51.015 --> 45:54.217
You don't, you're a good kid,
you're a good kid.

45:54.219 --> 45:56.986
Does your school
have any jingles?

45:56.988 --> 45:58.488
We have mottos.

45:58.490 --> 46:00.456
Such as?

46:00.458 --> 46:03.826
Fail early, fail often,
fail cheaply.

46:03.828 --> 46:07.363
Well, I have
the fail often one down.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.934
I believe in you, Jack.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.936
Why's that?

46:13.938 --> 46:16.005
The knife.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.540
You kind of sucked at first,

46:17.542 --> 46:21.477
but when you put your
mind to it, you rocked.

46:26.150 --> 46:28.885
I should probably get back.

46:28.887 --> 46:31.888
Hey, if you're, uh, looking
to practice your bow skills,

46:31.890 --> 46:34.924
there's a campfire over
there with a self-absorbed

46:34.926 --> 46:38.461
conan the barbarian just
lounging like a sitting duck.

46:38.463 --> 46:41.964
I'm good, I have a plan.

46:41.966 --> 46:45.001
Smart, I think I do, too, now.

46:45.803 --> 46:46.969
Hey...

46:49.940 --> 46:53.409
You should, um,
you should take the knife.

46:53.411 --> 46:55.278
What, no, I can't
take your knife.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.880
Seriously, as a memento.

46:59.449 --> 47:03.586
Eh, thanks, Rambo.

47:05.022 --> 47:09.492
Yes, generosity badge!

47:11.595 --> 47:14.263
I thought the whole,
uh, glamping vibe

47:14.265 --> 47:18.034
fit well with the organic
farming and tiny living turf.

47:18.036 --> 47:21.838
When did
you make these yurts?

47:21.840 --> 47:23.940
I call them yurts
because they call Mongolia

47:23.942 --> 47:26.876
the Texas of Asia, but, uh,

47:26.878 --> 47:29.378
technically,
they're belle tents.

47:29.380 --> 47:32.448
More, uh, um, Kenya
than ulaanbaatar.

47:32.450 --> 47:35.084
Well, we were looking
forward to the spartan,

47:35.086 --> 47:40.056
but we've been upgraded to
the set of <i> out of Africa.</i>

47:40.058 --> 47:45.361
You know, I had
a farm in Africa,

47:45.363 --> 47:48.364
at the foot of the ngong hills.

47:48.366 --> 47:52.468
- Oh, I love meryl!

47:52.470 --> 47:53.903
Isn't she amazing?

47:53.905 --> 47:56.072
Amazing!

47:56.074 --> 47:59.408
Amanda, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47:59.410 --> 48:01.477
I'll change, I'll do better,

48:01.479 --> 48:04.046
for you, for the girls.

48:04.048 --> 48:05.514
I'll ferment for the better.

48:09.520 --> 48:12.555
- Meryl streep, what a woman!

48:12.557 --> 48:17.193
Did you see ricki and the
flash, she is a rockstar!

48:18.328 --> 48:20.396
Jack, hey!

48:20.398 --> 48:22.598
-I was just, uh--
-watering the flowers?

48:22.600 --> 48:26.402
Yeah, yeah, I'll just head
out, you have a good night.

48:26.404 --> 48:28.104
Good night.

48:28.106 --> 48:29.972
Yeah, don't hurt yourself
chopping reclaimed wood

48:29.974 --> 48:35.378
next to your compost pile,
huh, lit by fireflies!

48:35.380 --> 48:38.648
He was definitely
making himself at home.

48:38.650 --> 48:43.352
He is at home, and he
was fixing the fan for us.

48:45.255 --> 48:47.123
I'm sure he was.

48:48.558 --> 48:52.461
So, where have you
been for so long?

48:52.463 --> 48:54.163
Finding myself.

48:55.032 --> 48:57.366
And how are you doing that?

48:57.368 --> 49:00.102
Scouts never tell.

49:03.408 --> 49:05.641
I already checked for bugs.

49:05.643 --> 49:07.076
I'm checking for Jordan.

49:07.078 --> 49:10.212
Funny.

49:11.281 --> 49:14.450
Funny, you think I'm funny?

49:14.452 --> 49:17.553
Funny how, like I amuse you?

49:17.555 --> 49:19.555
Funny like a clown?

49:22.159 --> 49:23.559
<i>Goodfellas.</i>

49:26.029 --> 49:28.631
You are not your writing, Jack!

49:28.633 --> 49:31.100
Just end the pity party!

49:35.173 --> 49:40.176
But we're in
a debt-death spiral.

49:40.178 --> 49:43.346
I don't care if we live
in a Van or a yurt

49:43.348 --> 49:48.551
or a cardboard box, as long
as we're on the same page.

49:48.553 --> 49:50.519
Are you serious?

49:50.521 --> 49:54.223
Like, we can survive,
if you would just take the job

49:54.225 --> 49:57.360
at the girls' school,
then we would be fine!

49:57.362 --> 50:02.198
Survive, me teaching
at a elementary school

50:02.200 --> 50:04.033
would be career suicide!

50:04.035 --> 50:08.037
All you care about
is your fucking career!

50:08.039 --> 50:11.741
It is dead and buried,
just let it go, and...

50:14.111 --> 50:15.411
Move on!

50:20.350 --> 50:23.652
I'm sorry.

50:25.589 --> 50:26.789
Jack.

50:29.460 --> 50:33.029
Jack, what...

50:34.731 --> 50:36.665
I'd rather sleep outside alone

50:36.667 --> 50:40.236
instead of in here
in this fantastic yurt

50:40.238 --> 50:43.506
with a eco-natural milf
who thinks I'm dead.

50:49.180 --> 50:51.080
<i> Dead man walking.</i>

51:14.371 --> 51:17.306
Ok, don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't rock.

51:26.451 --> 51:31.153
Night-night,
donkey, night-night.

51:45.702 --> 51:47.136
Want some of that?

51:47.138 --> 51:49.605
No, I can't give you that.

51:49.607 --> 51:54.343
There you go, you drink,
you drink, I drink.

51:54.345 --> 51:57.646
Mm-hmm, you know,

51:57.648 --> 52:00.549
you think that you'll
never write another one!

52:03.387 --> 52:07.623
I'm talking about a
New York times best seller.

52:07.625 --> 52:10.893
Oh, oh, the crowds
on the book tour,

52:10.895 --> 52:14.830
they treated me like
i was a rock star.

52:14.832 --> 52:16.765
Well, maybe not U2 rock star,

52:16.767 --> 52:21.403
but at least gin blossoms.

52:23.908 --> 52:28.577
Between you and me, my big book
really wasn't that original.

52:30.213 --> 52:34.650
The post said I was a
curator of the truth,

52:34.652 --> 52:38.287
more like a custodian
of bullshit.

52:38.289 --> 52:42.758
My second and third book
were actually much better.

52:43.660 --> 52:44.693
You want me to curate

52:44.695 --> 52:46.729
some truth for you right now?

52:46.731 --> 52:49.899
As it turns out,
only thing I'm really

52:49.901 --> 52:53.369
semi-good at is being a father.

52:53.371 --> 52:57.540
If I screw this up,
it's every other weekend.

53:02.213 --> 53:04.914
Huh, who are you, Nick bottom?

53:06.616 --> 53:11.220
What, did puck turn
you into a donkey?

53:11.222 --> 53:14.757
Puck that guy.
Puck that guy!

53:16.861 --> 53:18.427
Come back here!

53:18.429 --> 53:19.862
Hey, c'mon!

53:27.237 --> 53:29.905
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no!

53:33.678 --> 53:38.881
No!

53:40.850 --> 53:44.520
Come here, mister, buddy, here!

53:44.522 --> 53:46.222
No, no, no, no, no!

53:46.224 --> 53:47.656
No, don't do it, no!

53:47.658 --> 53:52.428
Donkey, here donkey, here,
donkey, donkey, donkey!

53:52.430 --> 53:54.863
Get in there!

53:58.835 --> 53:59.969
Donkey!

54:01.771 --> 54:03.706
Look what I got for you!

54:03.708 --> 54:05.975
Come on, where'd you go?

54:06.977 --> 54:08.978
Nice place, hey, mister!

54:08.980 --> 54:10.679
C'mere, c'mere, buddy!

54:10.681 --> 54:13.515
Come on, boy, ok, come on!

55:06.804 --> 55:10.539
Morning, Jack,
please, take a seat.
Gather with us.

55:10.541 --> 55:13.575
My famous pork migas
will change your life.

55:13.577 --> 55:17.579
Jack doesn't
appreciate the acon-bay.

55:17.581 --> 55:18.881
Pet issues.

55:18.883 --> 55:21.650
Thanks, but we have
to hit the road.

55:21.652 --> 55:24.453
-We do?
-It's a long drive to
get our tickets changed,

55:24.455 --> 55:25.654
so if you don't mind, honey.

55:25.656 --> 55:28.490
All the more reason
to fuel up.

55:28.492 --> 55:29.758
There's always
time for mimosas.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.527
--Join us.

55:31.529 --> 55:32.795
We should stay.

55:32.797 --> 55:34.096
Nate's a professional chef.

55:34.098 --> 55:36.699
Huh, of course he is!

55:36.701 --> 55:39.501
We should go.

55:39.503 --> 55:41.070
Hey, don't
should on yourself, Jack.

55:41.072 --> 55:42.538
Pork you.

55:44.708 --> 55:46.675
- I'm not leaving.
-What?

55:46.677 --> 55:49.712
- I, I want you to stay here.

55:49.714 --> 55:54.350
Ok, look, I want you
to stay here with me, Jack,

55:54.352 --> 55:56.018
but I am not leaving.

55:56.020 --> 55:59.722
Not leaving. Mr., uh,
hot-for-you pants over here

55:59.724 --> 56:03.058
who double-booked us with the
true romance rabbits in heat?

56:03.060 --> 56:05.127
You can at least be nice,
Nate's making us

56:05.129 --> 56:07.963
his famous recipe from
his trip to Chile!

56:07.965 --> 56:10.532
How much Google stalking
did you do of this guy?

56:10.534 --> 56:11.633
Google stalking?

56:11.635 --> 56:13.569
Yeah, no wonder
we ended up here

56:13.571 --> 56:17.406
and not at that beautiful
lighthouse on the coast.

56:17.408 --> 56:20.642
No, no, we are supposed
to be saving our marriage,

56:20.644 --> 56:23.545
but all you have done
is be dude downer!

56:23.547 --> 56:27.516
Look, I have been listening
to you gripe about your career

56:27.518 --> 56:31.053
since before you even
had a career, I am done!

56:31.055 --> 56:32.454
Amanda.

56:32.456 --> 56:36.024
No, I am talking
and you will listen.

56:36.026 --> 56:38.560
Look, you can go,
but I am staying

56:38.562 --> 56:40.929
for every night my
brother paid for.

56:40.931 --> 56:44.666
Plus that extra night
free for taking the yurt.

56:44.668 --> 56:49.738
- You are not staying here
for us, mother Theresa.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.707
You are staying for magic Mike.

56:51.709 --> 56:54.510
Ok, well, at least
Nate knows what he wants.

56:54.512 --> 56:56.512
O-ho-ho yeah,
he knows what he wants.

56:56.514 --> 56:58.714
And doesn't whine
about it nonstop.

56:58.716 --> 57:02.584
He wants you, in the
field, in the yurt,

57:02.586 --> 57:05.854
in the Coop so you
can pet his chickens!

57:05.856 --> 57:08.123
Waa, waa, waa, waa, waa!

57:08.125 --> 57:12.528
You sound like Jack
if he were a goat!

57:16.033 --> 57:17.699
Hey, what are you doin' there?

57:17.701 --> 57:21.036
- Jack, stop!
-Hey-ey-ey, easy, tiger!

57:21.038 --> 57:22.838
- Jack, Jack stop it!

57:22.840 --> 57:24.807
- Ow, dammit!
- -Jack, stop!

57:24.809 --> 57:26.775
- Stop it!
- -Stop that!

57:26.777 --> 57:28.477
Hey, this is
a violent-free zone, man!

57:28.479 --> 57:29.645
- Jack!

57:29.647 --> 57:31.146
Dammit, man!

57:33.984 --> 57:35.818
Jack, seriously?

57:35.820 --> 57:36.752
Keys are in the car.

57:36.754 --> 57:38.454
Jack, Jack!

57:38.456 --> 57:40.923
- Have fun.
- -Are you ok?

57:40.925 --> 57:43.692
I don't, I don't know,
at least I felt that guy--

57:43.694 --> 57:46.762
later, donkey.

57:46.764 --> 57:49.565
Bro, it's like
30 miles to town!

57:53.070 --> 57:56.672
It's totally fine,
just have another mimosa.

57:56.674 --> 57:57.806
It's ok!

58:43.186 --> 58:46.822
Shit!

58:53.731 --> 58:55.597
Hey, hey!

58:57.935 --> 59:00.135
Yah!

59:00.137 --> 59:04.006
Everyone's friendly
in Texas, my ass!

59:13.284 --> 59:14.650
Fuck you!

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:17.846
Need a lift?

01:00:17.848 --> 01:00:19.247
What are you doing here?

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:21.116
On a quest, you?

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:24.152
-Uh, uh, tryin' to get home.
-Jump in.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:27.222
<i> There</i>
<i> are roaches in my room.</i>

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:35.731
Why don't
you let me drive?

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:38.266
Can't do it,
on a mission.

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:40.202
Do you even
have your license?

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:42.270
I've got my driving badge.

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:44.072
Does that work with the cops?

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:46.108
You seen any cops?

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:51.146
-Good point.
-How many seeds do
you think it takes

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.315
before you get on of those
engelmann prickly pears

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.217
to take root and grow?

01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:57.919
I don't know,
one in a hundred?

01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:01.156
-Try one in 250,000.
-Wow.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:04.126
Then only one in five of those
plants will actually bloom.

01:01:04.128 --> 01:01:05.761
That's rare.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.331
Where's your wife?

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:14.836
Um, she's glamping,
still glamping.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.673
So what exactly
are they intuiting?

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:19.074
They're sensing
your nurturing spirit.

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:22.010
Or they're
just smelling the food.

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.279
Don't sell yourself
short like that.

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:28.150
Alpacas and donkeys are
especially intuitive creatures.

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:30.752
Not the donkey I'm with.

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:37.025
It's no accident
i found you today.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.393
Why's that?

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:41.430
I was just praying for
some help with my catch.

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:48.236
Oh, four-wheelin', huh?

01:01:48.238 --> 01:01:50.939
I keep getting bitten,
but I can't find the bugs!

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:52.274
- Chiggers.
- -Chiggers?

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:53.809
Yeah, these little
mites bite your skin

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:56.211
and release enzymes
that feed the larva.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.913
Oh, that's disgusting.

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:02.951
Hey, how's it goin'?

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.957
Ha-ha, you got your pig!

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:11.093
Woo-ee, Ben, you got
a big boy back here!

01:02:11.095 --> 01:02:12.260
Yes, sir.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:13.929
Congratulations!

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:17.265
You know when I was younger,
i had a pet pig.

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:19.167
Funny story, his name was--

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:23.038
wilbur.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.076
Sorry 'bout that.

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:36.118
- Oh my gosh, are you ok?

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.354
Oh, shit.

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:43.825
Well, uh...

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:47.829
Oh, that's a lot of poop.

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:50.265
Baron academy encourages us

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:53.135
to see the origin of our food.

01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:55.804
I don't think this
is where it comes from.

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:59.040
Oh, now, come on,
reach in there

01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:00.242
- and yank!

01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:02.410
That's it.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:05.046
- I am crushing this badge.

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:06.915
I need to get to town.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:09.785
Not yet, I still have to
clean and render everything.

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:10.919
Oh...

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:16.525
I have to get to the airport

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:19.427
and get some plane tickets
so I can see my girls.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:20.962
My grandmother lives in town,

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:23.198
she can take you to the airport.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.400
How do I get to town?

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:26.935
I, I tell you what, townie,

01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:28.136
you take old Betsy over there,

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.538
and you can leave her with Jude.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.040
Thank you.

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:36.912
Your boy ain't got
no guts!

01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:38.547
That's it, boy.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:47.189
Yeah, gonna take that off.

01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:49.457
Oh, not to worry,
it's, it's hemp.

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:51.259
- Hmm.
-It's biodegradable.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.461
Hey, would
you mind passing me

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:56.865
some of that aloe Vera plant
over there?

01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:58.033
Thank you.

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:07.843
- You ok?
-Yeah, I think I'm fine.

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:10.111
- There it is.

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:11.413
Look at that.

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:15.383
- Mother nature.

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:17.385
It works every time.

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.958
Hmm.

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:28.463
God.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.100
Hey, would you happen
to know nuad boran

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:34.336
massage therapy by any chance?

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:37.339
Uh, no.

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:41.243
Oh.

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:45.981
Ok, um.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.087
You hear that?

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:53.622
It's mating season.

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:54.923
Oh.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:58.593
You got it?

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:01.162
I think so, thank you.

01:05:01.164 --> 01:05:03.231
You sure you're not
headed the wrong way?

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.533
I'm heading home to my girls.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:08.503
Maybe, but for how long?

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:09.638
What do you mean?

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.673
What do I mean?

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:14.309
What the hell are you
talkin' about, Benny boy?

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:18.647
It's this zen crap
he learns from his school.

01:05:18.649 --> 01:05:20.916
Fine, I'll shoot straight.

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:23.084
Show some grit and
get your wife back.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:24.586
That's what your
girls would want.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.124
This baby Yoda here
does make a lotta sense.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:33.028
You're rollin' outta here
madder 'n' a bobcat
caught in a piss fire!

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:37.666
It seems to me the only
real problem you got's you.

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:39.935
Oh, lotta people around here

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:44.139
sure have a lotta tidbits
of wisdom they like to share.

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:45.640
We gotta lotta free
time in the country,

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:47.409
time to ponder the deep shit.

01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:51.012
Like, can god make a rock so big

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:53.548
that even he can't lift it?

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:58.219
Don't tell me
if you know the answer.

01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:00.021
I just love that question,

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:02.657
- that's a good one, innit?
- -Yeah.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.494
Good luck with your badges.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.396
- Thanks.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.112
Guess people really do need
to learn everything
on their own.

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:28.149
True, he's ridin' a gravy
train on biscuit wheels.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.652
What does that even mean?

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.521
What do I mean?

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:37.459
Ok, yeah, where
did you learn that?

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:41.363
Eh, a monk showed me
this technique in Shanghai.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:43.098
What were you doing there?

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.067
Just trying to
sneak into Burma.

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:47.736
Oh, Burma?

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:49.270
Yeah, humanitarian support

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:53.208
for ethnically-oppressed
people in the war zones.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:55.310
That's amazing.

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:59.614
Well, if you're
into that kinda stuff.

01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:03.251
Mm.

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:06.388
I'll tell ya what, I'm
gonna take a quick shower,

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:10.358
then we can head over to the
beehives for a little tour.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.060
Sounds great.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.597
Which part?

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:19.067
Uh, I'll meet you
at the beehives.

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:23.805
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:26.074
Son of a bitch!

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:50.632
- No, no!

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:36.478
-Right over there.
-Thank you, man.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.459
Uh...

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:59.801
I ain't helpin'
cover up another murder.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:02.837
Oh, no, no, I just need
a ride to the airport.

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:04.706
Dressed like that?

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.307
Ben sent me.

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:09.344
You got cash?

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:12.447
That's part of the problem.

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:14.349
I have this watch.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:21.456
Get dressed, I'll get my keys.

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:26.728
No, I don't think
i will kiss you,

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.662
although you need kissing badly.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:29.731
See, that's what's
wrong with you,

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:31.466
you should be kissed and often.

01:09:31.468 --> 01:09:33.635
- Easy.
-And by someone who knows how.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.435
<i>Gone with the wind.</i>

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:37.772
You're good.

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:42.176
Ok, I mean, he went from
totally geek to totally chic.

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:43.778
Uh, eh, another hint?

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:46.714
Oh, I, Kenneth is trying

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:48.283
to pull a Ronald Miller scam--

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:49.951
<i> -can't buy me love.</i>
<i>- -Yes!</i>

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:52.353
-Another classic.
-Oh!

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.689
- Aw, there she is!

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:56.457
I, are we too close?

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.893
-No, we'll be fine here.
-Ok.

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:02.230
Did you know 90 percent
of bees are female?

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:03.865
They dance to communicate

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:06.467
the location of
the closest nectar.

01:10:06.469 --> 01:10:08.503
- I didn't know that.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:20.381
Your hands are
so soft, but firm.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.350
Are you a pianist?

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:24.252
I wish.

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:28.423
I was a writer,
I'm not sure what I am now.

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:29.724
What you are and what you do

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:33.294
are two completely
different things.

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:39.467
So you are at the very least
a husband, father, son,

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:42.270
and, I assume,
a friend to someone,

01:10:42.272 --> 01:10:45.873
as well as being
my strange passenger.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.442
That's what you are.

01:10:47.444 --> 01:10:49.978
What you do is play piano.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:52.880
Uh, write, writer.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.751
I thought you gave that up?

01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:02.390
I see what you did there,
pretty sneaky, sis!

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:06.728
Big difference between
human doin' and human bein'.

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.966
Startin' to see where your
grandson gets all his insight.

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:13.735
Sure as hell wasn't

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:17.305
from that hippie urban school.

01:11:17.307 --> 01:11:19.540
How long you been hitched?

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:21.876
14, 15 years.

01:11:21.878 --> 01:11:25.380
Ah, she put up
with ya that long?

01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:26.714
- Huh, yeah.

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:28.750
She must be a good woman.

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:29.884
She is.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.588
She is, all right.

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:34.989
Where is she now?

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:41.863
You know, people make seriously
bad life-altering decisions

01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:45.433
when they're trying
to do instead of be.

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:47.368
If you lose somethin' important,

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.305
you'll live your whole life
wishin' ya had it back.

01:11:56.879 --> 01:12:00.615
What's gone is gone,
can't bring it back!

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:06.087
Unless...

01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:10.792
I was just
messin' with ya!

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:16.664
You lost your sense
of humor, too!

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:21.602
See those
flowers over there?

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:24.806
- Yes.
-The flashy petals, the scent,

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:27.342
designed to attract pollinators.

01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:29.577
- Step this way.

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:31.646
Bees sting ya in there.

01:12:31.648 --> 01:12:34.415
Swimming in their own honey.

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:38.853
Worry not, honey, I'm trained.

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.999
- Ah, hey, hey!

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:55.703
Looks like someone hit
the jackpot!

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.705
Yeah, ok, please work,
please work!

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:00.641
Come on, girls.

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:02.410
<i> -Daddy!</i>
<i> -Hey!</i>

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:03.678
<i> Hi, daddy!</i>

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.647
Hey, girls, oh,
i miss you so much!

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:08.883
- <i> We miss you, too!</i>
<i> -I love you!</i>

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:11.919
-Listen,
I'm comin' home early.
<i> -Yay, yes!</i>

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:13.521
<i> Wait, where's mommy?</i>

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:16.824
Mom's still at green acres,

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:18.593
but she'll, she'll be back soon.

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:20.528
<i> No, we don't want stepparents!</i>

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.964
No, listen,
I'm always gonna be--

01:13:22.966 --> 01:13:25.066
<i> kids in our class</i>
<i> always get new dads.</i>

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:26.534
<i> -Yeah.</i>
<i> -What?</i>

01:13:26.536 --> 01:13:28.469
<i> Daddy, are you there?</i>

01:13:28.471 --> 01:13:33.040
Listen, listen, Molly,
no, no, no!

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:35.610
- Dammit, oh.

01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:38.012
Did you
say green acres?

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:39.647
Yeah.

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:42.517
Should be more
like gigolo acres.

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:46.788
-What?
-My no-good nephew
runs that place.

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:49.624
So, you're telling me

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:51.659
Nate and Ben are related?

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:54.128
What'd you think,
Ben's trespassing out there,

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.798
killing other people's pigs?

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.067
So why is the great
Nate cortes no good?

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:01.869
Ha, cortes.

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:04.972
His real name is Nate Smith.

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:07.642
He lives in a condo in Dallas,

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:10.778
a-and he works in
commercial real estate.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.114
He's always losin' his shirt,

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:15.049
pourin' out that
fake farmer shit

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:19.120
so he can impregnate
the guests.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:21.989
My wife is there
with him right now.

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:24.459
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:28.229
Well, it's not the first
time he's been called daddy-o.

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:35.169
All right, we gotta go back.

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:36.771
We gotta go back, turn around!

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:38.840
Turn around, turn around,
we have to go back!

01:14:38.842 --> 01:14:41.943
-Please!
-Now you're talkin',
let's go get 'er!

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:15.042
Stop thinking
about what I want,

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:18.713
what he wants,
what your parents want!

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:22.750
What do you want?

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:25.953
Did you just quote
<i> the notebook?</i>

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:27.722
Correct!

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:32.159
You can't live your
live for everyone else,

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:34.295
you've got to do
what's right for you,

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:37.565
even if it hurts
some people you love.

01:15:37.567 --> 01:15:38.699
More <i> notebook.</i>

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:43.037
You know I'm a gentleman,

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:45.606
and I don't want you to
make any rash decisions

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.308
or anything like that,
but you also know

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:51.612
there is some organic
magic happening here.

01:15:51.614 --> 01:15:54.215
Mm, organic magic.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:57.118
Look, take all
the time you want.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.088
I can be patient for the
soulmate of a lifetime,

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:04.825
but I, I hate to
see a passionate,

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:07.161
under-cherished,
beautiful woman like yourself

01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:11.032
leave the woods
only to discover she...

01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:14.669
Never really took
a chance at living.

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:16.637
I'll be in my tipi.

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:21.208
There's a tipi?

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:32.687
-That's as far as I go.
-What, why?

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:37.224
Well, I still gotta see that
lunk birthdays and holidays.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:38.926
Understood.

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:41.195
Hey,

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:48.169
don't lose somethin' important
focused on the wrong thing.

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:50.638
I get it, thank you.

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.379
Godspeed, piano man!

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.866
Amanda!

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:25.239
Amanda!

01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:30.645
Hello, hello?

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:35.650
Amanda, are you up there?

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:39.420
Hello!

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:46.060
Oh, captain, my captain.

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:50.097
Amanda?

01:18:02.412 --> 01:18:03.744
Have you seen Amanda?

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:05.346
She's with Nate!

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:07.915
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.401
--I'm sorry, no looking,
no looking!

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:29.003
Hey, hey, excuse us!

01:18:29.005 --> 01:18:31.839
- Oh, bro, not cool!
-Carry on!

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:42.483
Ok.

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:31.432
All right.

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:01.128
Amanda!

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:03.564
Amanda!

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:08.002
Where are you?

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:46.907
Hey, gorgeous!

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:49.276
I got these drums at taos
pueblo when I was staying

01:20:49.278 --> 01:20:51.412
-at the lemuria earthship.
-Stop.

01:21:01.457 --> 01:21:04.124
- Stop playing now!

01:21:32.321 --> 01:21:35.256
Amanda!

01:21:37.927 --> 01:21:39.059
Jack?

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:17.965
Mmm.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:27.141
You sang for me!

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:29.209
Yeah.

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:30.678
And you're up there!

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.014
I know, I don't know
how I'm gonna get down.

01:22:34.016 --> 01:22:38.152
No, I'm coming up,
you climbed for me!

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:47.528
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:51.432
I'm sorry, too, I just
i got caught up and all--

01:22:51.434 --> 01:22:55.302
no, please, all I need
are you and the girls.

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:57.504
I'll teach English,
I'll clean bathrooms,

01:22:57.506 --> 01:23:01.442
I don't care as long
as I have you three.

01:23:01.444 --> 01:23:03.577
Can you please forgive me?

01:23:03.579 --> 01:23:07.448
Please, I've been such
a complete jackass.

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:12.419
You sang to me.

01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:13.620
And I'm not even drunk!

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:22.129
Hey, what happened
to you, is that blood?

01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:23.764
It's a long story.

01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:27.401
Hey, Jack.

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:31.538
It's good to see ya, Jack.

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.474
- Hey, Nate.

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:36.377
Yeah, Friday I'm in love!

01:23:36.379 --> 01:23:38.379
--You know, uh,

01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:42.483
the townsfolk are even
better than Wikipedia.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:48.689
You should all Google
Nathaniel Smith.

01:23:48.691 --> 01:23:51.625
Oh, ok. All right, why don't we
start over here, all right?

01:23:51.627 --> 01:23:54.528
Both of you booked rooms
for the long weekend.

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:57.131
Why don't I just, uh,
let you fine folks be.

01:23:57.133 --> 01:24:01.735
Is that what you have to do
before you go back to
your real home in Dallas?

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:06.573
Nate Smith, Mr. organic
farm boy lives in the big d?

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:08.542
- Oh, ok!
-No, thank you!

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:10.177
I'll be happy to
give you the rest

01:24:10.179 --> 01:24:15.182
of your stay here just
free of charge, my treat.

01:24:15.184 --> 01:24:19.219
Do you know the difference
between fermentation
and erosion?

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:21.588
Yes.

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:24.725
Oh, well, uh,

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:27.061
tell your nephew
he owes me a badge.

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:28.695
Sure.

01:24:28.697 --> 01:24:30.164
I'm telling
Jordan to unfollow him

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:32.599
as soon as we get service.

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:36.303
-What was that about?
-Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:39.173
So that's it, you're
just gonna walk away,

01:24:39.175 --> 01:24:41.175
like nothin' ever happened here?

01:24:41.177 --> 01:24:44.111
He's not important, let it go.

01:24:44.113 --> 01:24:45.579
Let it go,<i> frozen.</i>

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:49.416
Hey, you two should
take the trailer.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.785
We're gonna go on an overnight
trip, we'll let you be.

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:55.089
-Oh, you don't have to--
-well--

01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:57.691
no, it's our pleasure,
we were leaving anyways.

01:24:57.693 --> 01:24:59.526
Abe promised me a pet pig.

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:01.728
Yeah, babe's gettin' a babe!

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:04.264
- Be really careful.

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:06.233
You kids enjoy.

01:25:06.235 --> 01:25:07.768
Solid advice.

01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:12.372
Sure you're ok?

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:17.878
Yeah, better than
I've been in... forever.

01:25:20.116 --> 01:25:22.416
You can tell me
about it later,

01:25:22.418 --> 01:25:26.120
but for now, no more talking.

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:06.894
Still up, professor?

01:26:06.896 --> 01:26:08.729
I don't think
you get that title

01:26:08.731 --> 01:26:11.798
teaching fifth grade English.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.268
Are you starting a new book?

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:15.869
A blog actually.

01:26:15.871 --> 01:26:17.905
A typewritten blog?

01:26:17.907 --> 01:26:20.707
Yeah, it's all the rage.

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.378
I love you.

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:26.880
I love you, too.
