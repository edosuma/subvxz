00:57.425 --> 01:01.095
Ah, it's the last time
I'm gonna be dealing with this.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.738
Ow!

01:11.805 --> 01:14.242
Go, you guys, go!

01:14.342 --> 01:16.177
Get a move on!

01:38.132 --> 01:39.467
Hey.
Hi.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.868
Oh, what you
working on?

01:40.968 --> 01:43.237
I'm making a list of fun
stuff to do with Rosa

01:43.337 --> 01:46.807
since Deeks is not available
to critique my ideas.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.108
Mmm. Where is he?

01:48.209 --> 01:49.410
Oh, he took a personal day.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.544
He's gonna look at places
with his mom.

01:50.644 --> 01:51.779
She wants to
move closer to us

01:51.879 --> 01:53.314
to help out with Rosa and stuff.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.184
Ooh, is that a good idea,
have the mother-in-law so close?

01:56.284 --> 01:58.686
I mean, as of now,
I think it's a great idea.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.188
But only time will tell.

02:00.288 --> 02:04.225
Yeah. Okay, so
tell me, what is on this list?

02:04.325 --> 02:05.526
Okay, so, uh, first of all,

02:05.626 --> 02:06.827
there is a production
at the Geffen

02:06.927 --> 02:08.529
that I think
she'll like.
Mm-hmm.

02:08.629 --> 02:09.730
Uh, then, of course,
I'm gonna take her to the Getty,

02:09.830 --> 02:11.432
the Broad, LACMA,
of course,

02:11.532 --> 02:13.167
and MOLAA, which, by the way,

02:13.267 --> 02:14.902
is the only museum

02:15.002 --> 02:17.605
in the entire country
dedicated to Latin American art.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.807
Can you believe that?
The only one.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.975
Wow.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.645
A play and four museums?

02:25.513 --> 02:26.780
Why, did I forget one?

02:27.581 --> 02:29.950
Oh, the Huntington. Thank you.

02:30.718 --> 02:35.155
No, it's just, you know,
I thought you said "fun stuff."

02:36.156 --> 02:37.658
Wha... Okay.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.628
Um, what do you suggest?

02:41.529 --> 02:42.796
I don't know, you know,

02:42.896 --> 02:44.131
you could take her
shopping at the Grove,

02:44.232 --> 02:45.566
or, like,

02:45.666 --> 02:47.100
a live audience taping
of her favorite show,

02:47.201 --> 02:51.004
uh, an escape room,
or-or you can take her

02:51.104 --> 02:52.773
on a, like,
celebrity house tour, maybe?

02:52.873 --> 02:55.343
I'm sorry, you think
being a celebrity stalker

02:55.443 --> 02:58.011
is more fun than
art and theater?

03:00.614 --> 03:02.350
You know
what you're doing, right?

03:02.450 --> 03:03.951
No.

03:04.051 --> 03:07.955
You're ushering Deeks
into the role of "fun parent."

03:08.055 --> 03:10.258
Please, you're overthinking it.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.125
Am I?

03:12.226 --> 03:15.128
In the words of <i>Highlander,</i>
"There can be only one."

03:16.230 --> 03:17.665
And according to that list,
it's ain't you.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.633
You know what,

03:19.733 --> 03:23.771
maybe I don't want
to be the fun parent.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.873
Wait a minute.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.443
You think it can't be you.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.345
You think
because Deeks is

03:31.445 --> 03:33.013
some laid-back surfer dude

03:33.113 --> 03:34.448
that he's automatically gonna
get the role of fun parent?

03:34.548 --> 03:35.616
I'm fine.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.751
It's all fine.
No, no, no.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.621
It can be you, Kensi.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.456
You just got to want it.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.992
And come up with a better list.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.995
Okay? Love you, girl.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.830
You got this.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.700
Do I?

03:57.871 --> 04:01.108
Hey,
everything okay?

04:01.208 --> 04:02.676
Thanks, Captain.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.313
I'm just glad
the damage was low.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.547
Yeah, I spoke to him.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.248
The neighbor's going
to check on him now.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.452
Thank you.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.953
What's that all about?

04:13.053 --> 04:14.622
Fire department.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.657
My dad's on his own
this morning,

04:16.757 --> 04:18.459
forgot his steak and eggs
on the stove.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.727
Is he all right?

04:19.827 --> 04:21.762
He's fine, he's just
a little embarrassed.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.597
Boy, you really do
need help.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.032
I gotta figure
this thing out, G.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.735
So, what is that now,
three caretakers

04:27.835 --> 04:29.437
and one adult
daycare jailbreak?

04:29.537 --> 04:31.171
But who's counting?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.106
How do you go from
commanding a battalion

04:33.206 --> 04:34.875
to suddenly needing
a caretaker?

04:34.975 --> 04:37.044
Kicking and screaming,
that's how.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.646
Speaking of
kicking and screaming,

04:38.746 --> 04:40.013
did you get in touch
with the suit guy yet?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.782
Trust me,
I don't need your guy.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.116
Trust me, you do.
I'm not gonna be

04:43.216 --> 04:45.419
standing up there
next to a sad-looking groom.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.920
Oh, that's cute.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.188
You think you're gonna be
in the wedding party.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.090
I'm not playing, G.
This guy's backed up.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.492
Gonna need to give him
some lead time,

04:51.592 --> 04:52.926
so I can give him
some direction.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.462
What are you thinking?
Uh-huh. I'm thinking

04:54.562 --> 04:56.564
I'm just gonna grab something
that's hanging in wardrobe.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.765
We got a lot of
good suits over there.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.967
You're joking.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.169
You're not joking.
Why don't you just get married

05:02.269 --> 05:03.771
in the bullpen
while you're at it?

05:03.871 --> 05:05.806
What? There's a lot
of nice suits over there.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.608
Yeah, with gun powder and blood

05:07.708 --> 05:09.142
and whatever else
blended into the fabric.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.379
I will have it
dry cleaned beforehand.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.980
Twice. I promise you.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.815
Hetty'll kill you
if you do that.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.884
Yeah, well, she'd have
to come out of hiding first.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.652
Look, I gave you
the guy's information,

05:18.752 --> 05:21.221
why don't you just
let him sort you out?

05:22.022 --> 05:24.024
At what price?
Don't worry about it,

05:24.124 --> 05:26.394
it'll be my wedding gift.
I'll take up a collection.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.861
Oh.
Yeah.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.363
I'm just not sure if
the guy will even take you

05:29.463 --> 05:30.864
because he's used to
a certain type of clientele.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.767
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.403
What kind of clientele
is that, exactly?

05:35.503 --> 05:36.937
The kind that doesn't
walk down the aisle

05:37.037 --> 05:39.272
with a suit
full of bullet holes.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.476
Caught a case.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.944
After you.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.281
<i>Early this morning,
Rear Admiral Ted Gordon</i>

05:48.382 --> 05:49.917
was abducted from his home.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.219
A neighbor heard a struggle
and saw two masked suspects

05:52.319 --> 05:53.587
dragging him into a van.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.788
They caught some of it
on their security camera,

05:54.888 --> 05:56.757
but I couldn't
pull the plates.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.792
Kidnappers typically
want a ransom.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.160
Did they make any demands
of the admiral's family?

06:00.260 --> 06:03.997
Well, he has none.
Never married, no kids.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.066
Couldn't find any
extended relatives, either.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.601
He was recently
on terminal leave

06:07.701 --> 06:08.736
in advance of
his pending retirement.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.003
Is he working
on anything

06:10.103 --> 06:11.439
that could have
made him a target?

06:11.539 --> 06:14.141
So, Admiral Gordon works
with Nautical Robotics Inc.,

06:14.241 --> 06:15.943
a civilian tech contractor
in Pasadena

06:16.043 --> 06:18.245
that develops unmanned
maritime technologies.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.213
So, underwater robots.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.182
You know it.
And, according to the Navy,

06:22.282 --> 06:23.917
they're currently
working on a new fleet

06:24.017 --> 06:26.219
of ocean gliders.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.255
The Navy already deploys
these for critical missions.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.158
They can do scientific research,
catch drug smugglers,

06:31.258 --> 06:32.359
deploy weapons.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.027
Well, both the Russian and

06:34.127 --> 06:35.429
Chinese governments have already
seized these in the past,

06:35.529 --> 06:37.330
claiming them
to be spy boats.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.899
They're not wrong.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.167
I mean, it could be
what's happening here,

06:40.267 --> 06:41.435
except instead of
seizing the glider,

06:41.535 --> 06:42.770
they're seizing its engineer.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.171
Well, why steal a glider
when you can just

06:44.271 --> 06:46.006
kidnap somebody and have
them make one for you?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.275
We need to talk to someone
at Nautical Robotics,

06:48.375 --> 06:49.977
find out
what could be compromised.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.411
Castor's picking up
their head developer

06:51.512 --> 06:53.413
Jessie Fiore, he's bringing
him to the boatshed.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.382
Okay, I'll, uh, take Rountree
and meet him there.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.917
Sam and I will head
to the crime scene.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.819
All right.
Go team.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.026
Hey, guys, this is Jessie Fiore,
Nautical Robotics.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.495
Thank you, Castor.
No problem.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.196
Uh, hi, Jessie,
I am Special Agent Kensi Blye,

07:09.296 --> 07:12.032
this is Special Agent Rountree.
Have a seat.

07:12.132 --> 07:16.136
Hi. I'm still not exactly
sure why I'm here.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.771
Something about
the ocean glider?

07:17.871 --> 07:19.807
Uh, no, actually,
we wanted to talk to you

07:19.907 --> 07:21.341
about Admiral Ted Gordon.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.910
How closely
do you work with him?

07:23.010 --> 07:26.179
Very. He's the Navy arm
of our project.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.482
Is he okay?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.985
He was kidnapped this morning.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.922
Oh, my God.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.990
You think it's
related to our work?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.326
It's a possibility.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.794
Do you know
if he was ever threatened

07:40.894 --> 07:41.895
for access to the technology?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.764
I don't think so.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.566
But if he was,
it wouldn't have worried him.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.569
Ted's not scared of anything.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.670
He's just like my dad.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.171
Hmm.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.840
I used to invite him
to our family barbecues.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.408
"Used to?"
Yeah.

07:55.509 --> 07:58.345
I guess you could say
we had an issue.

07:58.445 --> 07:59.813
What type of issue?

07:59.913 --> 08:02.049
It was nothing. I'm over it.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.251
Hmm. We'd still like
to hear about it.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.886
Yeah.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.990
There's an entire team working
night and day, right?

08:10.090 --> 08:11.759
But Ted goes on Marcus Moore
and completely...

08:11.859 --> 08:14.227
I'm so sorry. Uh, Marcus Moore?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.329
He's a popular social media
tech influencer.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.631
More than just popular.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.533
He's got 12 million subscribers. Wow.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.635
He did an entire interview,
and not a word about us.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.503
Ted's cool,

08:23.604 --> 08:24.605
but he's full of himself.

08:24.705 --> 08:25.773
A tiny shout-out could've

08:25.873 --> 08:26.874
catapulted
my career.

08:26.974 --> 08:27.941
I mean,
I do the heavy lifting.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.309
Literally. When we run tests,

08:29.409 --> 08:31.011
I'm out there
deploying the glider.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.412
He can't do it solo.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.548
It's not a one-man band.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.450
So, I'm sorry, did the admiral
discuss sensitive information

08:37.551 --> 08:39.887
about the glider
on Marcus Moore's show?

08:40.888 --> 08:42.723
But I assumed he got approval.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.224
So, ocean gliders,

08:44.324 --> 08:46.359
they don't have propellers
or an internal engine?

08:46.459 --> 08:49.597
No, the gliders
aren't like a torpedo,

08:49.697 --> 08:50.598
although they look like one.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.332
No, there's a pump

08:52.432 --> 08:55.736
which displaces
the buoyancy over time,

08:55.836 --> 08:57.938
and allows the glider
to move up

08:58.038 --> 09:00.140
and to move down
through the ocean.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.042
Similar to how
air gliders works.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.311
Except that it moves up
as easily as it goes down.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.280
Sounds like ocean gliders
are the "wave" of the future.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.949
Hmm.
And the one
you're developing

09:09.049 --> 09:10.283
is environmentally
friendly, correct?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.519
Mm-hmm.
Yes, it's completely silent,

09:12.620 --> 09:15.155
so it doesn't
disrupt water currents,

09:15.255 --> 09:17.390
it doesn't disrupt
the wildlife.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.760
And most ocean gliders

09:19.860 --> 09:21.561
are only workable
in deep oceans,

09:21.662 --> 09:22.562
but this one, mine...

09:22.663 --> 09:24.397
mine works in shallow seas,

09:24.497 --> 09:26.834
it works in coastal areas...
so that it's wonderful

09:26.934 --> 09:28.836
for biology
or climate research.

09:28.936 --> 09:32.572
And compared to other
autonomous underwater vehicles,

09:32.673 --> 09:34.174
yours is more economical.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.943
Oh, by far.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.045
Well, the interview
was authorized.

09:38.145 --> 09:41.414
And he's not sharing
anything classified.

09:41.514 --> 09:45.185
And the ocean glider can be fit
with a variety of sensors,

09:45.285 --> 09:47.420
including compact magnetometers,

09:47.520 --> 09:50.557
which are able to detect
certain anomalies in the ocean,

09:50.658 --> 09:53.560
like shipwrecks
or underwater munitions.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.330
Still, it is possible
that this interview

09:57.430 --> 10:00.267
put the admiral
on someone's radar.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.669
China.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.170
Well, that's
one possibility.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.038
No, the day after
this interview,

10:05.138 --> 10:06.974
Marcus Moore
flew to China.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.977
An American
cybersecurity firm

10:10.077 --> 10:11.344
claims to have proof
that he met with

10:11.444 --> 10:14.281
a group of Chinese
state-sponsored hackers.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.566
Listen, they have robots
for everything.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.003
Ocean patrol,
food delivery.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.471
I hear they even have
robot babysitters for kids.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.173
Won't be long before
Robocop's a real thing.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.075
I wouldn't mind
partnering up with Robocop.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.344
Well, you've got the
same sense of humor.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.781
Heh, Robocop watching my dad,
now that might be a thing.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.720
Okay.

10:52.820 --> 10:56.656
Well, welcome to
the National Maritime Museum.

10:57.991 --> 11:01.094
Wow, talk about
a proud sailor.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.798
This guy has got
antique compasses, telescopes.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.567
This stuff has
got to be valuable.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.605
Oh, come on.
This can't be real.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.041
What do you got?

11:15.208 --> 11:18.879
Ancient cannonballs.
This thing is heavy.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.849
Huh.
Hmm.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.684
Oof. Looks like
they were digging around,

11:24.785 --> 11:26.887
looking for something
in these bookshelves.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.857
What do you think,
maybe a key to a safe,

11:29.957 --> 11:30.657
a gun?

11:30.758 --> 11:33.126
Or paperwork.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.595
Maybe they thought they'd find
the schematics to the glider.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.564
But when they discovered
they weren't here...

11:37.664 --> 11:39.232
Or if he refused to cooperate...

11:40.300 --> 11:43.070
They take him away,
try to force him to talk.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.571
Yup.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.849
Check this out.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.089
You notice anything?

12:02.923 --> 12:04.691
Excellent craftsmanship.

12:04.792 --> 12:08.896
"SOS." Look at the sails.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.497
You seeing that?
Yeah.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.866
That's Morse code.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.135
This could be a message.
That first one's an "I."

12:15.235 --> 12:16.236
Well, that's an "N."

12:16.336 --> 12:18.338
"S."
Another "I."

12:18.438 --> 12:19.873
"D," "E."

12:21.408 --> 12:23.610
"Inside."

12:28.648 --> 12:30.617
Is it illegal to go to China?

12:30.717 --> 12:33.620
No, absolutely not.
We're just trying to

12:33.720 --> 12:35.155
figure out what
the purpose of your trip was.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.091
Work. I'm looking to expand
the reach of my show.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.292
I was meeting with
tech giants there.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.194
Including Black Hat hackers

12:41.294 --> 12:43.696
responsible for ransomware
attacks on American hospitals?

12:44.497 --> 12:46.599
Look, I had no clue
that's what they were about.

12:46.699 --> 12:47.600
Hmm.
Then why'd you
meet with them?

12:47.700 --> 12:48.936
If you've seen my show,

12:49.036 --> 12:50.637
you'd know
I'm into electric vehicles,

12:50.737 --> 12:52.772
cool gadgets,
groundbreaking software.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.707
Those guys are major players
in those arenas.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.643
Okay, so what
did you discuss?

12:56.743 --> 12:58.245
The products
they're developing.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.980
Any mention of
Admiral Gordon's ocean glider?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.015
What? No.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.383
But the day before
you met with them,

13:03.483 --> 13:04.651
you had an interview
with Gordon

13:04.751 --> 13:06.086
about this
Navy technology.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.822
Why would I talk about that
in China?

13:08.922 --> 13:11.424
And that interview was
approved by the Navy, wasn't it?

13:11.524 --> 13:13.426
Yeah, it was.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.028
But the admiral
was kidnapped--

13:15.128 --> 13:19.032
we suspect by somebody hoping
to obtain the glider tech.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.235
Uh, wow.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.372
And you think I could be
involved in something like that?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.407
That's what we're trying
to figure out, Marcus.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.477
We've alerted FBI cyber,
and they will be doing

13:30.577 --> 13:32.012
a very
thorough investigation

13:32.112 --> 13:34.614
into your connections
to these hackers.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.383
I-I should've never done
that interview.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.318
It's been a total headache
from the beginning.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.687
How so?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.522
The admiral was difficult.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.692
He kept interrupting the
interview to make these calls.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.694
He'd be in the middle
of explaining something,

13:47.794 --> 13:49.829
and then just stop,
like four or five times.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.099
Editing was a nightmare
because of that.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.201
Do you have any idea
who he was calling?

13:55.068 --> 13:57.770
I didn't ask.
He went into the booth.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.072
I couldn't hear
what he was saying,

13:59.172 --> 14:00.707
but it was obvious
that he was angry

14:00.807 --> 14:02.175
and shouting at someone.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.413
Hmm.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.652
Here, try this.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.388
Let's hope we're not wrong.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.325
If we are, better hope there's
some Krazy Glue around here.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.802
All right.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.771
There we go.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.379
Admiral Gordon went to
a lot of trouble to hide this.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.449
And he went to a lot of trouble
to make sure it was found.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.219
So, who was he hoping
would find it?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.362
So, I checked Admiral
Gordon's phone records

14:55.462 --> 14:57.097
at the time of his interview
with Marcus Moore.

14:57.197 --> 15:00.267
He made several calls to a woman
named Meredith Huxley.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.370
She's a librarian
at the L.A. Public Library.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.404
Maps department.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.638
A librarian?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.540
Yeah, he called her,
like, five times

15:07.640 --> 15:09.209
in the span of one hour.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.777
I mean, wow,
he must've had something

15:10.877 --> 15:12.045
really important
to say to her.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.846
Yeah, you know what?
Send us her location.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.715
FBI's talking to Marcus.
While they do that,

15:15.815 --> 15:16.984
we'll go talk to
Meredith Huxley.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.186
Copy that. Thanks.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.221
Admiral.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.724
Looks like a good book.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.893
Oh, yeah.
He can't get enough of it.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.861
I'm that way
about Mann's <i>Heat 2.</i>

15:28.962 --> 15:30.463
You reading <i>Heat 2?</i>

15:30.563 --> 15:31.764
It's Admiral Gordon's
journal.

15:31.864 --> 15:32.966
I found it
at the crime scene.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.601
Hmm.
The abductors

15:34.701 --> 15:35.635
went through the place good.

15:35.735 --> 15:36.936
They were looking for something.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.371
Might have been this journal.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.875
"I've written this book
as a guide to my adventure

15:42.976 --> 15:44.911
"in case anything
should happen to me.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.280
"If you are reading this,
I must be in distress

15:47.380 --> 15:49.782
"and you have proven
clever enough to render aid.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.919
That is, if I'm still alive."

15:53.020 --> 15:55.288
So first his model ship,
then this journal.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.457
It's like he set up
his own little security system

15:57.557 --> 15:58.658
with codes and riddles.

15:58.758 --> 15:59.759
Mm-hmm.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.228
Yeah, but what's he securing?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.963
Buried treasure.

16:04.064 --> 16:07.334
This is all about
a Spanish galleon in 1602.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.269
It wrecked, the survivors
buried silver, gold,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.538
precious jewels, somewhere
in Southern California.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.074
I'm beginning to understand
why this guy never married.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.176
May I?
So, Admiral Gordon

16:16.276 --> 16:17.544
had his heart set
on buried treasure.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.112
Why record it
in this journal?

16:19.212 --> 16:20.713
Why does anybody
record anything?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.515
To prove it exists.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.051
And to make sure
it remains.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.153
I have a friend,
he's a retired Navy diver,

16:26.253 --> 16:28.321
works in an ocean salvage
company in Florida.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.457
Always looking
for shipwrecks and treasure.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.858
Hasn't found anything yet.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.360
Well, it doesn't mean
it's not out there.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.163
Ah, I see the admiral
is quite the artist as well.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.465
Looks like some of it
was ripped out.

16:38.565 --> 16:41.668
That's not a rip, that's a cut.
A very precise one.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.103
Well, if this journal

16:43.203 --> 16:45.538
is what the admiral's
abductors were after,

16:45.638 --> 16:47.474
let's find out why.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.344
Either we're looking
for criminals

16:51.444 --> 16:53.246
who are targeting the Navy's
maritime technology...

16:53.346 --> 16:57.184
Or... we're on a treasure hunt.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.132
Meredith Huxley?
Yes.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.466
I'm Special Agent Blye.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.268
This is Special
Agent Rountree, NCIS.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.070
We're here to ask you
some questions

17:17.170 --> 17:18.505
about Admiral Theodore Gordon.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.039
Seriously?

17:20.140 --> 17:22.575
Now the man
sends Navy cops?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.544
What else does he want?
I gave it back to him.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.879
Uh, I'm sorry,
gave what back to him?

17:26.979 --> 17:31.251
His... antique map.
Isn't that why you're here?

17:31.351 --> 17:32.252
Uh, actually, we're here

17:32.352 --> 17:33.620
because Admiral Gordon

17:33.720 --> 17:35.388
was abducted
from his home this morning.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.057
Oh, my, that's terrible.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.827
Wait, you think
this is because of the map?

17:40.927 --> 17:42.562
Well, you tell us.
He called you

17:42.662 --> 17:43.863
several times last week,
and some witnesses say

17:43.963 --> 17:45.465
he was very angry
about something.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.201
He was paranoid I had some plot

17:48.301 --> 17:50.203
to steal his precious map.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.338
Did you?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.406
No. Uh...

17:53.506 --> 17:55.508
I was helping him
research it.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.510
He thinks it leads
to buried treasure.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.913
Hmm. Sounds like
you're doubtful.

18:01.013 --> 18:04.717
Who am I to say if there's
gold at the end of the rainbow?

18:04.817 --> 18:06.986
He asked me to verify its
authenticity, that's what I did.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.189
Why would he think that
you'd want to steal his map?

18:09.289 --> 18:11.624
My daughter has a newborn,

18:11.724 --> 18:13.560
and she's
up in Sacramento.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.962
I left before I could
give the map back to him,

18:16.062 --> 18:17.997
so I locked it
in the cabinet here

18:18.097 --> 18:20.267
and I told him he could
have it in a couple of days.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.535
He went ballistic.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.371
But you did return
the map to him?

18:24.471 --> 18:25.705
Of course I did.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.140
He picked it up
as soon as I got back.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.976
And were you able to
determine its authenticity?

18:30.076 --> 18:33.713
Yes. 17th century Spain.

18:33.813 --> 18:37.016
It's printed on handmade
vellum laid paper.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.686
It has a grid of chain lines
with watermarks,

18:39.786 --> 18:41.654
which means it's the real deal.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.823
So the map's valuable.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.392
Something someone might
abduct him for.

18:45.492 --> 18:49.362
I'm not an appraiser,
but it's worth a pretty penny.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.531
If it leads
to treasure, who knows?

18:51.631 --> 18:54.000
But it's a true antique.

18:54.100 --> 18:58.238
Hmm. Do you have any idea
where he keeps the map?

18:58.338 --> 18:59.772
It would've been fine here,

18:59.872 --> 19:02.509
but he insisted on a climate
controlled storage space.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.010
I don't know where.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.813
Hmm. Do you have any
copies of it, by chance?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.815
No, I gave everything
back to him,

19:08.915 --> 19:10.450
except a few of his notes.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.320
His notes?
D-Do you have those here?

19:13.420 --> 19:17.324
Yes. Ted was in such a rush
to get the map,

19:17.424 --> 19:19.426
he forgot about them. Uh...

19:19.526 --> 19:20.993
would you like to see them?

19:21.093 --> 19:23.730
Uh, yes, please.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.533
I love hobbies just
like the next guy,

19:26.633 --> 19:27.834
but, I mean, this
is another level.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.802
This is more than a hobby,
this is a mission.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.839
He-he has notes
on the ship's manifest,

19:32.939 --> 19:34.274
its intended route
back to Spain,

19:34.374 --> 19:36.509
he's even got the star chart

19:36.609 --> 19:37.977
from the year
the ship went down.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.446
All right, so this guy gets
attacked by people

19:39.546 --> 19:41.214
who think he has the map
in his house.

19:41.314 --> 19:44.050
Right, they couldn't find it,
so they forcibly abduct him,

19:44.150 --> 19:45.918
and think they can
make him to take them to it.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.054
But Admiral Gordon's
not giving it up.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.856
All right. Well, we better find
out where he keeps this map,

19:49.956 --> 19:52.091
because if they torture
Admiral Gordon

19:52.191 --> 19:53.393
to force him to talk,

19:53.493 --> 19:54.927
he could be in trouble.
Or worse.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.864
He created a code
to find this journal.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.666
What if he also created
a code to find the map?

19:59.766 --> 20:03.202
I mean, this journal
is dedicated to the galleon,

20:03.303 --> 20:04.471
its history, its captain,

20:04.571 --> 20:06.138
but there is only one mention...

20:06.239 --> 20:07.974
Mm-hmm.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.176
...one mention of the map,
right here.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.979
"The Lone Sailor
can't see the treasure,

20:13.079 --> 20:17.317
but he looks to the map
at his parallel dove."

20:17.417 --> 20:18.485
It's a riddle.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.986
Of course it is,

20:20.086 --> 20:21.721
and in the time it takes us
to figure that out,

20:21.821 --> 20:22.855
Admiral Gordon could be dead.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.358
I solve crimes,
not riddles.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.726
Okay, well, this is both,

20:26.826 --> 20:29.161
and you happen to be
very good at this stuff.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.598
Let me see this thing.
Let me just see this.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.302
"The Lone Sailor
can't see the treasure,

20:35.402 --> 20:37.904
but he looks to the map
at his parallel dove."

20:38.738 --> 20:40.139
I don't know.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.009
I mean...

20:43.109 --> 20:44.977
it could be referring
to the Lone Sailor statue.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.914
Symbolizes the Navy's
mission to honor

20:48.014 --> 20:49.749
the men and women
of the sea services.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.719
There's one in Long Beach.
Let's check it out.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.687
It's worth a shot.

20:59.459 --> 21:02.194
They're mostly notes
about the map's symbols.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.531
I'm not sure
what you're hoping to find.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.898
We're hoping
to find something

21:05.998 --> 21:07.233
that'll tell us where
Admiral Gordon is.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.801
Yeah, we're thinking
that whoever took him

21:08.901 --> 21:10.737
is after the map
and, ultimately,

21:10.837 --> 21:12.138
after the treasure.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.307
If treasure even exists,
simply having the map

21:14.407 --> 21:17.209
wouldn't mean
someone could find it.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.445
Why is that?

21:18.545 --> 21:22.415
Ted's been working on this
for years.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.351
The map's legend

21:24.451 --> 21:25.785
is the shipwreck's location.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.688
That's why it was so tricky
for Ted to decipher.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.823
First it requires
locating the shipwreck,

21:30.923 --> 21:34.193
and then making complex
calculations to pinpoint

21:34.293 --> 21:35.895
the buried treasure
location on shore.

21:35.995 --> 21:39.231
Huh. Did Admiral Gordon
ever find the shipwreck?

21:39.332 --> 21:41.300
About a month ago,

21:41.401 --> 21:42.635
he claimed
to have located it

21:42.735 --> 21:44.971
using his
ocean glider technology.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.339
Where?

21:46.439 --> 21:48.975
I don't know. As soon as
he found the shipwreck,

21:49.075 --> 21:50.643
he became even more secretive.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.945
Uh, could you just
give us a moment,

21:53.045 --> 21:54.947
please, Meredith?
Thank you.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.685
Do you remember what that
tech developer, Jessie Fiore,

21:58.785 --> 22:00.520
said about operating
the ocean glider?

22:00.620 --> 22:01.954
It's not a one-man job.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.856
He said every time
they took the glider out,

22:03.956 --> 22:05.958
Jessie Fiore was
the one who deployed it.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.760
Which means he knows
about that shipwreck.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.829
Meaning he knows
about the map.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.732
Fatima, I need you
to locate Jessie Fiore.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.301
We think there's
more to his story.

22:23.309 --> 22:26.312
All right, let's do this.

22:26.413 --> 22:29.015
Fatima, read it out loud
to us one more time.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.217
"The Lone Sailor
can't see the treasure,

22:31.317 --> 22:33.586
but he looks to the map
at his parallel dove."

22:33.686 --> 22:35.788
Well, he looks to the ocean.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.289
Which is south.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.058
I mean, a lot of people
think it's west

22:39.158 --> 22:42.061
because it's the Pacific,
but this is south.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.430
Okay, so we're
at Ocean Boulevard

22:43.530 --> 22:44.831
and Paloma Avenue,

22:44.931 --> 22:49.268
And he's looking south
to the Pacific Ocean.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.405
South... at his parallel.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.340
Well, parallel is latitude.

22:54.441 --> 22:57.309
It's just a way to measure
north-south coordinates.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.178
His latitude dove?

22:59.278 --> 23:01.714
Wait, you guys are on
Paloma Avenue, right?
Yeah.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.717
"Paloma" is the Spanish
word for dove.

23:05.718 --> 23:06.919
His latitude <i>paloma.</i>

23:07.019 --> 23:09.789
Fatima, what's
the statue's latitude?

23:09.889 --> 23:13.626
The approximate latitude
is 33.76.

23:13.726 --> 23:17.497
Latitude Paloma.
3376 Paloma.

23:17.597 --> 23:18.698
Sounds like an address.

23:18.798 --> 23:21.067
Fatima, is there
a storage facility

23:21.167 --> 23:22.569
or something there?
Anything?

23:22.669 --> 23:24.170
Checking now.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.205
No, no storage facility.

23:26.305 --> 23:29.075
It's a bookstore.
"Antique Mariner Books."

23:29.175 --> 23:31.410
When this
guy picks a theme...

23:31.511 --> 23:33.780
He sticks to it.
All right, we're on our way.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.455
All right, the store's
closed today.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.756
I'm trying to get
in touch with the owner

23:43.856 --> 23:45.391
for permission to enter.

23:45.492 --> 23:48.027
May not be necessary.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.196
The door's open.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.120
Oh. Hey.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.222
You know this
is important.

24:16.322 --> 24:19.626
No, no, no. Don't worry
about it, I got it.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.327
All right?

24:21.427 --> 24:22.595
I'll handle it.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.096
Right? From this point on,
I got this.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.465
Federal agents!

24:29.869 --> 24:32.939
You got five seconds to come
out of there with your hands up.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.375
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.986
Go, go, go!

24:54.060 --> 24:55.962
Lost him.
He took off in a van.

24:56.062 --> 24:59.031
Fatima, looking for
a white van, no plates,

24:59.131 --> 25:00.166
moving at high speeds.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.500
Checking.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.135
Who do we got
under here?

25:04.837 --> 25:06.606
Ah.
Huh.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.140
Jessie Fiore.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.242
Nautical Robotics Incorporated.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.878
Where's Admiral Gordon, Jessie?

25:27.093 --> 25:28.928
So, we have
a missing Navy Admiral,

25:29.028 --> 25:31.397
a stolen treasure map
and a tech guy.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.465
Sounds like a true
crime podcast.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.101
"The Making
of a Pirate."

25:36.335 --> 25:37.503
Where is Admiral Gordon?

25:37.604 --> 25:38.638
I can't tell you.

25:38.738 --> 25:39.706
Can't because you don't know

25:39.806 --> 25:40.740
or because you don't want to?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.642
Because I like being alive.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.711
Has your life been threatened?

25:46.813 --> 25:48.314
I really screwed up.

25:48.414 --> 25:49.782
Who are you afraid of?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.117
And everything just got

25:51.217 --> 25:52.585
completely out of control
really quickly.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.420
Look, we're here
to find Admiral Gordon

25:54.520 --> 25:55.454
and to make sure
everyone's safe, okay?

25:55.554 --> 25:56.723
That includes you.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.224
But you have to be
up-front with us

25:58.324 --> 25:59.692
so we can do our jobs.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.427
Was Admiral Gordon in that van?

26:02.862 --> 26:03.930
Yeah.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.265
Where is it headed?

26:07.066 --> 26:08.868
They're taking him
to the Channel Islands.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.170
Which island? There are five.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.705
The map doesn't name the island

26:12.805 --> 26:14.006
because it didn't have a name

26:14.106 --> 26:15.775
when it was drawn
hundreds of years ago.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.176
And Ted wouldn't tell me.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.245
Fatima.
Sam.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.379
Still no sign
of the van.

26:20.479 --> 26:21.881
It's possible
they switched rides.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.449
Okay, so they're headed
to the Channel Islands,

26:23.549 --> 26:24.851
but we need to
narrow it down,

26:24.951 --> 26:26.185
so check with the
National Park Services.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.854
If Admiral Gordon
has moored his boat

26:27.954 --> 26:29.288
or camped on one
of the islands,

26:29.388 --> 26:30.923
they'll have records.
Copy that.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.124
I'll let you know
what I find.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.960
Thank you.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.328
Well, thank you
very much, Meredith.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.430
I'm sorry I couldn't do more.

26:38.530 --> 26:39.732
It's fine, we just have to

26:39.832 --> 26:41.233
start thinking
more like Admiral Gordon.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.535
Cryptic, in puzzles
and riddles.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.072
Whoa.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.506
That seems like
a heavy briefcase.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.875
It is.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.142
Uh, may I ask what's inside?

26:50.242 --> 26:52.979
Nothing, now.
I dumped everything out.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.648
Uh, is that yours
or the admiral's?

26:55.748 --> 26:57.416
It's Ted's.

26:57.516 --> 26:59.485
I know, I should
give it back to him.

26:59.585 --> 27:02.188
Um, may I, please?

27:31.217 --> 27:32.384
Whoa.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.585
There's something in there.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.187
You feel that?

27:36.222 --> 27:37.589
Yeah.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.893
It's sewn in.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.799
Okay, the runner?
Does he have the map?

27:46.899 --> 27:48.400
Yes.
What's his name?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.036
Jim.
Jim what?

27:50.136 --> 27:51.103
Jim Bones.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.105
This guy's got jokes.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.774
I'm serious.
Er, that's how I knew him.

27:54.874 --> 27:55.708
All right, so let's
start from the beginning.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.143
You helped Admiral Gordon

27:57.243 --> 27:58.610
find an ancient shipwreck

27:58.711 --> 28:00.212
using your ocean glider.

28:00.312 --> 28:01.781
He said once you
found it, he could locate

28:01.881 --> 28:03.082
a buried treasure
worth millions,

28:03.182 --> 28:04.616
and that-that
sounds reasonable to you?

28:04.717 --> 28:06.618
I mean, he's located
shipwrecks before.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.620
He's worked with
professional treasure hunters

28:08.721 --> 28:10.289
all over the world.
According to him,

28:10.389 --> 28:12.058
the odds of finding it are way
better than winning the lottery.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.793
Well, that's not exactly
setting a high bar.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.527
All right,
so you helped him.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.529
How'd we end up here?

28:18.297 --> 28:20.933
When we found the shipwreck,
he refused to show me the map.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.568
He said he'd dig it up
on his own and give me my share.

28:22.668 --> 28:24.270
But you didn't trust him.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.637
I was angry.

28:25.738 --> 28:26.705
I told him
we were in this together,

28:26.806 --> 28:27.907
but he shut me out.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.842
That's where this
Jim Bones fella

28:29.942 --> 28:31.443
comes in?
I joined this

28:31.543 --> 28:32.611
treasure hunt forum online.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.180
I met these two guys,

28:34.280 --> 28:35.547
Jim Bones and Long John.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.083
I told them about the map
and the shipwreck.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.717
You can't make
this stuff up.
You can't.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.519
They agreed to help me.
All right?

28:40.619 --> 28:42.154
They were just supposed to break
into his house to find the map.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.756
I didn't know they were
going to kidnap him.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.825
Gordon's amazing.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.559
He wouldn't give up the map,

28:47.659 --> 28:49.095
not even after
they roughed him up.

28:50.529 --> 28:53.299
But he finally gave in when...

28:54.801 --> 28:56.969
When what?

28:58.504 --> 29:01.040
They put a gun to my head
and threatened to kill me.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.576
So Gordon told them
about this place.

29:04.676 --> 29:07.013
He saved my life.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.748
Even after I betrayed him.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.990
All right.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.766
Whoa.
Huh.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.936
It's locked.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.537
Uh, do you have a hammer
or something?

29:31.637 --> 29:33.239
Uh...
Wait a minute.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.141
Meredith, what year
did the ship wreck?

29:35.241 --> 29:37.043
1602.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.111
Try that.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.013
One.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.982
Six.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.550
Oh.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.252
Two.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.357
Open sesame.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.895
Let's get this
to Fatima. Yeah.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.500
Right, this drawer
is wide open and is empty.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.601
Is this where the map was?

30:02.701 --> 30:04.036
Yeah.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.771
And there's a key in the lock.
How'd you get it?

30:05.872 --> 30:07.073
He gave it to us.

30:07.173 --> 30:10.342
It's the only one
that has a lock on it.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.444
What else is in there?

30:14.280 --> 30:16.382
Books. That's it.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.320
It's stuck.

30:22.754 --> 30:24.256
There's gotta be
something else in there.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.970
Hmm.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.238
Okay.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.740
So we got a cipher
decoder wheel.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.977
Encrypted
manuscripts.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.246
Most of this stuff
is in Latin.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.450
Then there's this.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.354
Cut straight from his journal.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.591
Hold that up.
Got that?

31:00.826 --> 31:02.094
Any luck narrowing
down the island?

31:02.194 --> 31:04.763
No, Admiral Gordon
hailed the ranger

31:04.863 --> 31:06.598
on all five
of the Channel Islands.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.766
Ah...

31:07.866 --> 31:09.168
Could be headed
to any one of them.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.203
Hey, Fatima?
Yeah?

31:11.303 --> 31:13.072
I'm sending you what looks
to be the missing piece

31:13.172 --> 31:14.941
from Admiral Gordon's
ocean sketch.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.408
Copy that, Callen.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.344
Kensi and Rountree also
sent a missing part,

31:18.444 --> 31:21.447
so, hopefully, now we
have the whole sketch.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.049
Here we go.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.817
Thank you. Okay.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.520
Now I just have
to trim them down,

31:28.620 --> 31:30.822
and...

31:30.923 --> 31:31.823
...there we have it.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.492
What do we have?

31:33.592 --> 31:36.895
I mean, it must be important,
but what does it mean?

31:36.996 --> 31:38.597
That's a good question.
Let's see.

31:38.697 --> 31:41.200
Wait a minute.
Wait a second.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.870
Right there, in that wave.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.039
Does that look like
a letter to you?

31:47.139 --> 31:49.108
Yeah, it does. A "U."

31:49.208 --> 31:50.542
"T."

31:51.777 --> 31:52.811
"Q."

31:52.911 --> 31:55.681
"N," "A."

31:55.781 --> 31:57.083
Is that all of them?

31:57.183 --> 31:59.485
Yeah. From left to right,

31:59.585 --> 32:02.554
It's Q-N-A-T-U.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.390
Q-N-A-T-U.

32:05.191 --> 32:07.526
I'm not even going to
try to pronounce that.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.228
I'm not getting anything.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.831
Maybe the letters aren't
in a certain order.

32:17.236 --> 32:20.339
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Now...

32:20.439 --> 32:24.143
perhaps they are
in a certain order.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.645
Would you agree with me
that these waves

32:26.745 --> 32:30.016
appear to be
traveling towards us?

32:30.116 --> 32:31.183
Yes.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.252
Yeah, the size of
the crest of the waves

32:33.352 --> 32:35.121
here in the foreground indicate
that they're close to shore.

32:35.221 --> 32:37.189
Precisely what I was thinking.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.191
And in this drawing,
the waves

32:39.291 --> 32:41.260
originate from the horizon.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.763
Therefore, if the letters
do spell out a word,

32:44.863 --> 32:45.964
then we are

32:46.065 --> 32:47.866
to order them according

32:47.966 --> 32:50.102
to the movement
of the waves.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.538
Go on with your bad self.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.273
So what do we have?

32:54.373 --> 32:55.607
We have...

32:55.707 --> 32:57.176
T-U-Q-A-N.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.011
Tuqan.
Tuqan. Tuqan.

32:59.111 --> 33:02.381
Tuqan... is the name
of a Palestinian poet.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.016
And also...

33:04.116 --> 33:07.053
the Chumash word for
San Miguel Island.

33:07.153 --> 33:10.356
Of course.
As avid historians,

33:10.456 --> 33:13.325
treasure hunters often refer
to indigenous culture.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.694
Guys? Guys,
we cracked the sketch.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.329
Gordon's headed to
San Miguel Island.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.331
We're gonna
need a chopper.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.666
I'll dispatch one right away.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.668
San Miguel's a naval island.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.803
Indeed it is.

33:24.903 --> 33:26.338
Please be advised, agents,

33:26.438 --> 33:29.308
it was once
a missile test site

33:29.408 --> 33:32.844
and is thought to be littered
with unexploded ordnance.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.702
Easy.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.939
G.

34:02.007 --> 34:04.009
Gotta watch
your step, G.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.345
One false move, kaboom.

34:06.445 --> 34:07.846
Not funny.

34:07.946 --> 34:09.515
I'm serious, there's a lot

34:09.615 --> 34:10.549
of unexploded ordnance
on this island.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.918
It's a naval
target island.

34:17.589 --> 34:21.560
You, my friends,
are making a colossal mistake.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.595
This island is cursed.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.597
Shut up and dig.

34:26.398 --> 34:31.370
Juan Cabrillo, conquistador
and Portuguese explorer.

34:31.470 --> 34:34.540
He died upon these very dunes.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.509
But as he lay dying,

34:37.609 --> 34:39.345
he cursed this island

34:39.445 --> 34:41.113
so that all who came
here afterwards

34:41.213 --> 34:44.850
with ill intent would
fall victim to violent deaths.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.552
We just want the money.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.420
And once we get it,

34:48.520 --> 34:50.422
you're gonna
die here, too.
Ha!

34:50.522 --> 34:54.860
A couple of punks like you two
are not gonna ruin my destiny.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.463
You hear this guy?

34:57.563 --> 34:58.964
You're crazy, old man.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.267
Federal agents!

35:01.367 --> 35:02.568
Hands up!

35:02.668 --> 35:03.902
Drop your weapon!

35:06.672 --> 35:08.006
Drop it!

35:09.341 --> 35:10.609
I said drop it!

35:10.709 --> 35:12.043
There's nowhere to go.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.749
Unbelievable.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.702
I tried to warn him.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.938
Cursed.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.380
So, EOD and the medivacs

35:48.480 --> 35:50.182
cleared the site.
We're good to go.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.886
I'm absolutely astonished
that you were able to find me.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.154
Well, you didn't

35:56.255 --> 35:57.489
exactly make it easy.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.395
I've been searching
for this treasure for decades.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.698
I recently realized
that if I were lost at sea,

36:06.798 --> 36:07.966
that all of the work

36:08.066 --> 36:09.701
that went into trying to solve

36:09.801 --> 36:11.370
the enigma of the map

36:11.470 --> 36:13.038
would've been for naught.

36:13.939 --> 36:18.009
The puzzle, journal,
they were my fail-safe.

36:18.109 --> 36:21.713
A way of ensuring that whoever
followed me and found them

36:21.813 --> 36:24.283
and solved them
had the same spirit that I did.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.119
I just never realized
that my passion

36:28.220 --> 36:32.090
would put me
and anybody else into danger.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.193
Jessie Fiore told us
what you did.

36:36.495 --> 36:40.198
You risked losing the treasure
and the map to save his life.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.935
Gold and silver
are worth a fortune,

36:44.035 --> 36:46.071
but a human life is priceless.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.841
Even a scoundrelous
traitor like Jessie.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.145
Thank you for your
hard work, agents.

36:56.181 --> 36:57.583
Admiral, your
chopper's waiting.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.951
No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.421
First, we finish the adventure.

37:02.521 --> 37:03.755
No, no, no.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.424
I've had enough
adventure for one day.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.025
It's late and...

37:07.125 --> 37:10.629
And you don't believe
it's there, do you?

37:11.663 --> 37:13.865
I didn't say that.
I did.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.936
Go home. Get some rest.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.307
Suit yourselves, agents.

37:22.207 --> 37:24.376
I'll be returning
in my own vessel.

37:24.476 --> 37:28.380
Anything that I find,
I will report to SECNAV.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.650
You don't have to worry
about me, I'll be fine.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.820
I don't doubt it, Admiral.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.922
You're cut from
a different cloth.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.460
When ships were made of wood...

37:41.560 --> 37:44.062
men were made of steel.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.198
I like that.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.934
So do I.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.373
Okay.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.809
What do you think about
a beach wedding?

37:57.909 --> 37:59.345
You're not a beach guy.

37:59.445 --> 38:00.879
I'm a beach guy.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.614
No, you're a beach bar guy,
not a real beach guy.

38:02.714 --> 38:03.982
Besides, you're
petrified of sharks.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.317
No, I'm not
petrified of sharks,

38:05.417 --> 38:07.152
I just prefer beaches
that don't have sharks.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.987
They call those
the Great Lakes.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.322
Okay.

38:10.422 --> 38:11.823
Besides, if you
have a beach wedding,

38:11.923 --> 38:13.291
you're at the mercy
of the weather.

38:13.392 --> 38:16.027
It's either too hot
or a marine layer rolls in

38:16.127 --> 38:18.096
and then it's freezing,
and it's raining.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.432
Or a storm whips up
the night before

38:20.532 --> 38:22.501
and dumps a whole bunch of
rotten seaweed on the shore,

38:22.601 --> 38:23.702
and the whole venue stinks.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.504
Could you be
more negative?

38:25.604 --> 38:27.806
I'm not negative.
I'm actually being practical.

38:27.906 --> 38:30.876
My advice? Let Anna
plan the wedding.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.278
Huh.
All right?
You just smile and nod,

38:33.379 --> 38:34.346
say the magic words.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.481
"Please," and "Thank you?"

38:35.581 --> 38:37.383
The married man's
magic words:

38:37.483 --> 38:39.685
"Whatever you want, honey."

38:39.785 --> 38:41.653
Besides, we got more important
things to think about.

38:41.753 --> 38:42.654
Yeah, what's that?

38:42.754 --> 38:44.523
Bachelor party.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.057
I'm not having a bachelor party.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.659
Oh, you're definitely
having a bachelor party.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.861
Do not plan me
a bachelor party. I mean it.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.130
After all this time,
it's going to be epic.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.765
No, no.
I'm serious, Sam.

38:53.865 --> 38:54.800
Uh-huh.
I won't go.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.067
You don't have a choice.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.335
Deeks already
booked the flights.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.804
I'm not flying anywhere.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.906
Mexico. Cage diving.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.674
Sharks.
Oh.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.209
You're not funny.
Pretty sharks.

39:04.309 --> 39:06.344
You're not funny.
You're gonna
love it.

39:08.414 --> 39:09.581
Hey.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.150
Hey. That was quite a day.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.720
Yeah. I hate to say it,
but that was fun.

39:15.921 --> 39:16.888
Okay, so... Yeah.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.123
...I've been
thinking about

39:18.223 --> 39:19.257
your activities
list with Rosa.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.993
You mean
my boring plans?

39:22.093 --> 39:24.530
No. Okay,
hear me out. Okay.

39:24.630 --> 39:29.100
What if you turned all this
cultural, educational stuff

39:29.200 --> 39:32.504
into, like, a scavenger
hunt around L.A.?

39:32.604 --> 39:35.273
You know, that way, she can get
to know the lay of the land,

39:35.373 --> 39:37.175
I could help come up with,
like, clues and puzzles

39:37.275 --> 39:38.644
to lead her to
the next place.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.546
Haven't you had
enough of that today?

39:40.646 --> 39:42.481
No, never. Okay.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.249
I want to do more.
You know, puzzles,

39:44.349 --> 39:46.117
brain teasers.
Keep the mind sharp.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.955
Hmm. Will a scavenger hunt
give me the role of fun parent?

39:50.055 --> 39:51.590
Oh, absolutely.

39:51.690 --> 39:52.858
Then I'm in.

39:52.958 --> 39:53.859
Unless Deeks takes her, like,

39:53.959 --> 39:54.926
skydiving or something.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.862
You know,
he totally might.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.431
Yeah. In that case, he's got
the role of fun parent. Sorry.

39:59.531 --> 40:00.866
Hey, guys.

40:00.966 --> 40:03.034
Hey.
Hey.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.136
You think Admiral Gordon's
gonna find the treasure?

40:06.137 --> 40:09.140
Oh, man. That, I do not know.

40:09.240 --> 40:13.579
What I do know is that, man,
that guy loves the hunt.

40:13.679 --> 40:14.913
Mm.
Totally,

40:15.013 --> 40:16.948
but isn't that
what it's about?

40:17.048 --> 40:19.485
Not the treasure,
but the journey to it.

40:27.859 --> 40:29.828
How's your dad?

40:29.928 --> 40:31.129
He's fine.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.264
Any idea what
you're gonna do?

40:34.800 --> 40:36.835
Gonna find him
a reliable companion,

40:36.935 --> 40:39.204
someone he gets
along with.

40:40.438 --> 40:44.510
Met a nice nurse, Constance.
Think I'll give her a call.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.512
So, no robot?

40:48.179 --> 40:51.016
When robots have emotions,
I'll consider that option.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.718
They're coming.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.620
You know it's coming.

40:56.421 --> 40:59.190
You don't think we should've
convinced Admiral Gordon

40:59.290 --> 41:01.226
to get on that chopper
with us, do you?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.395
He's good.

41:04.496 --> 41:06.064
He really thinks
he'll find that treasure.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.266
Almost lost his life over it.

41:09.968 --> 41:14.205
For centuries, men have been
willing to risk life and limb

41:14.305 --> 41:18.476
in search of sunken riches,
buried treasure.

41:18.577 --> 41:22.013
It's just stories, Admiral. Folklore.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.816
Hmm. Well, however
fantastical it may seem,

41:24.916 --> 41:29.988
treasure hunting spurred
the birth of modern capitalism.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.690
Hmm. I don't
play Lotto,

41:31.790 --> 41:33.091
I don't gamble,

41:33.191 --> 41:34.760
and I damn sure
don't search for treasure.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.028
You know what treasure is to me?

41:37.128 --> 41:39.230
A 50-pound kettlebell
and some baby oil?

41:42.467 --> 41:45.571
Family and friends,
a good day's work.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.939
Hmm.
I'll drink to that.

41:48.039 --> 41:50.175
Oh, by the way, uh...

41:50.275 --> 41:54.179
Admiral Gordon dropped this by
for the two of you.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.814
Evening, gentlemen.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.416
Evening.
Good evening.

42:02.487 --> 42:03.889
What is it?

42:03.989 --> 42:05.757
Give me your hand.
Why?

42:05.857 --> 42:08.126
Give me your hand.
What is it?

42:08.226 --> 42:11.396
♪ See how the mainsail sets ♪

42:11.496 --> 42:13.064
♪ Uh-huh-huh-huh,

42:13.164 --> 42:14.332

42:14.432 --> 42:16.602

42:16.702 --> 42:20.872

42:23.441 --> 42:24.843

42:24.943 --> 42:27.312

Okay.

42:27.412 --> 42:28.980

42:29.080 --> 42:30.816
That can't be real.
