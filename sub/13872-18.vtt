00:02.702 --> 00:04.897
<i>So, gentlemen...</i>

00:05.105 --> 00:07.971
you try that foot lotion I gave you?

00:08.041 --> 00:11.602
The one with the gorilla on the bottle?
You know? The one...

00:11.678 --> 00:13.873
Does it look like I tried it?

00:14.781 --> 00:15.770
You did!

00:58.725 --> 01:01.250
<i>Hello? I'm here. Anyone home?</i>

01:01.327 --> 01:03.056
<i>Hi! Is anyone in there?</i>

01:03.129 --> 01:05.859
<i>- I'm coming!
- Hey, I'm here!</i>

01:05.932 --> 01:07.797
<i>- What the hell are you?
- Hey!</i>

01:08.334 --> 01:09.858
<i>I am the wisdom cube.</i>

01:09.936 --> 01:12.063
<i>This one time three years ago,
I broke my arm.</i>

01:12.138 --> 01:15.596
<i>I was informed improperly that my keys
were in a throttling woodchipper.</i>

01:15.675 --> 01:19.372
<i>Alas, they were not.
I shall never wear a cast again.</i>

01:19.446 --> 01:22.074
<i>The itching drove me
to the brink of insanity.</i>

01:22.148 --> 01:25.049
<i>From now on,
all my locks shall be keyless.</i>

01:25.118 --> 01:27.518
Who you talking to?
Wait, move over, let me see.

01:27.587 --> 01:31.182
<i>I was saying, I broke my arm in
a skiing accident. Busted this tree in half.</i>

01:31.257 --> 01:32.986
<i>- But you just said...
- I know the truth.</i>

01:33.059 --> 01:37.120
<i>I ski sometimes in Vail. I'm allowed to.
Okay? We have a house there.</i>

01:37.197 --> 01:39.859
<i>I hardly even use it,
but I'm there sometimes.</i>

01:40.100 --> 01:41.727
<i>- Well, why...
- And no keys.</i>

01:41.801 --> 01:43.769
<i>- "F that, "I said.
- In that case, why...</i>

01:43.837 --> 01:45.896
<i>You should not ask me
those types of questions.</i>

01:45.972 --> 01:49.203
<i>I've all the wisdom in the universe.
I won't sit here for eternity...</i>

01:49.275 --> 01:51.470
<i>answering your dumb,
tiny-minded questions.</i>

01:51.544 --> 01:53.239
<i>So, deal with that.</i>

01:55.248 --> 01:57.716
<i>- Then, what's...
- Did I not say "the wisdom cube"?</i>

01:57.784 --> 01:58.910
He said it! I was here!

01:58.985 --> 02:03.046
<i>Maybe I'll wear a sticker around my chest
since you're so hung up on labels.</i>

02:04.891 --> 02:07.189
- What's this old board doing here?
- Don't ask!

02:07.260 --> 02:08.386
<i>No, ask, please!</i>

02:08.461 --> 02:11.521
<i>- All right. What you doing?
- Told you not to ask!</i>

02:11.598 --> 02:15.193
<i>I'm here for some practical joke...
Job interviews.</i>

02:15.268 --> 02:18.999
<i>Pass me your phone,
I need to make some long-distance calls.</i>

02:19.439 --> 02:23.398
<i>Hello? Is this Jan Webster? It is?</i>

02:26.779 --> 02:29.839
Classic! It never gets old for me.

02:29.916 --> 02:31.076
<i>You have any phone books?</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:33.517
<i>- I'm out of Webster's.
- What? That's it?</i>

02:33.586 --> 02:35.884
You're not even gonna touch
the Washingtons?

02:35.955 --> 02:39.891
<i>- I know. I saw them, too. Which page?
- One page back. Right here.</i>

02:39.959 --> 02:42.689
<i>That's right, yeah.
You found it. I'll note that.</i>

02:42.762 --> 02:45.094
<i>Hello? Is this A. Washington?</i>

02:45.665 --> 02:46.825
<i>It is?</i>

02:47.700 --> 02:50.931
Yeah! Washington! You busted him!

02:51.538 --> 02:53.802
<i>- Let me try one!
- I don't wanna do it anymore.</i>

02:53.873 --> 02:56.899
<i>Get me a pallet of toilet paper.
I've got a wise idea.</i>

02:57.076 --> 03:00.739
<i>Come out, fat man!
Come out and witness your demise!</i>

03:01.447 --> 03:05.781
He came out already. He had to go get
one of them... What do you call it...

03:05.852 --> 03:08.286
when you have to stay
100 feet away from...

03:08.354 --> 03:11.881
<i>- It's called a free beer next door. Come on!
- All right!</i>

03:15.195 --> 03:18.289
<i>- I said, "Come on!"
- I came. Where are you?</i>

03:18.364 --> 03:21.390
<i>- What are you doing?
- You're scared now? What's up, wuss?</i>

03:21.467 --> 03:24.027
<i>Say "Mother, may I, " then spell "cup. "</i>

03:24.103 --> 03:27.869
It says here that this wisdom cube
is the wisest being in the universe...

03:27.941 --> 03:30.341
and he travels the galaxies
feeding off knowledge.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.469
He be feeding off
them microwave burritos, too.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.570
- Those are gone?
- There were six this morning.

03:34.647 --> 03:38.640
There ain't none now. He's gassy, boy.
Don't say nothing about him farting?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.310
He's just doing that with his mouth.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.355
Sometimes, the most brilliant people
are the most eccentric.

03:43.423 --> 03:46.119
Really? That's a dead-on impression
of a butt.

03:46.192 --> 03:47.955
Take me for instance. I'm brilliant.

03:48.027 --> 03:51.121
Haven't you noticed how
I like to wear this around occasionally...

03:51.197 --> 03:53.062
and pretend like I've been bad?

03:53.132 --> 03:56.158
No. But I have now.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.170
You've seen me like this, right?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.672
Yes! I have, I told you I did. I just...

04:01.841 --> 04:03.832
I didn't know I was supposed to.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.434
Let's change the subject.

04:05.511 --> 04:07.706
Guess what else
that cube did this morning?

04:07.780 --> 04:11.739
- Look at that. He done TP'ed Carl's house.
- I better go talk to him.

04:11.818 --> 04:16.118
Yeah, you might just sort of
take that thing off, too.

04:16.255 --> 04:20.158
- Tell me I've been bad.
- Yes, you've been acting up lately.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.557
I'm sorry.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.994
<i>When he comes out here,
hit him with the egg.</i>

04:24.063 --> 04:25.553
- Say...
- Gotcha! Run!

04:25.632 --> 04:26.929
<i>Fight!</i>

04:28.401 --> 04:30.631
<i>Do it! Fight! Come on! Fight!</i>

04:30.903 --> 04:33.565
<i>- Don't worry, I know where he lives.
- Yeah, okay.</i>

04:33.640 --> 04:36.473
You contain all wisdom and knowledge
throughout the galaxy?

04:36.542 --> 04:37.566
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:37.644 --> 04:39.771
I've been struggling with this paradox.

04:39.846 --> 04:43.077
If there is a God, then why is there
so much suffering in the world?

04:43.149 --> 04:46.778
Or did he just create us in his image
out of egotism, or, what's the point?

04:46.853 --> 04:47.842
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:50.156 --> 04:51.851
That's all you got to say?

04:53.426 --> 04:56.623
<i>- Take a picture. It'll last longer.
- What kind of response is that?</i>

04:56.696 --> 04:59.688
<i>Why don't you sit down over there
and let me tell you a story.</i>

04:59.932 --> 05:03.527
<i>This one time, I ate boiled peanuts.
Like a whole lot of them.</i>

05:03.603 --> 05:06.902
<i>And I'd like to have got sick.
You know what I mean?</i>

05:07.473 --> 05:09.236
I think I understand.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.143
I'm not sure I'm getting the total grasp
of what you're saying. If you...

05:13.212 --> 05:14.474
What are you saying?

05:14.547 --> 05:17.038
<i>Keep honking. I'm reloading my gun.</i>

05:18.151 --> 05:20.381
That's not really the response I expected.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.614
<i>I'm not as think as you drunk I am.</i>

05:22.755 --> 05:25.747
<i>- Anyway...
- Horn broken? Watch for finger.</i>

05:26.426 --> 05:27.893
Okay, look at the time.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.054
<i>Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder,
that's what I've heard.</i>

05:31.130 --> 05:33.496
<i>- Don't want to cut you off.
- Don't go! No, wait!</i>

05:33.566 --> 05:36.194
<i>Work is for people
who don't know how to fish!</i>

05:36.269 --> 05:37.702
Look! There's Carl!

05:37.770 --> 05:38.964
Hold up, man!

05:39.038 --> 05:41.734
- No. Don't come over here.
- Don't go anywhere! Stay there!

05:41.808 --> 05:44.538
<i>- Very funny, now beam down my clothes.
- Look, I'm sorry.</i>

05:44.610 --> 05:47.408
I'd love to stay here,
but I gotta go over there with Carl...

05:47.480 --> 05:49.710
<i>- and spank him.
- Shut up and fish!</i>

05:49.782 --> 05:51.977
No. I got nothing to say to you.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.315
- Nothing personal.
- Thank you.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.320
<i>Nice yard! It's nice!</i>

05:56.389 --> 05:57.947
How's that restraining order coming?

05:58.024 --> 06:00.720
For your information,
it's still tied up in the courts.

06:00.793 --> 06:05.093
'Cause I don't have photographs of things
like this thing you're doing with my butt.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.894
What are you doing here? Stop doing it!

06:08.434 --> 06:10.732
Wait, no. No, wait. Keep doing it.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.532
Let me go get my camera!

06:12.605 --> 06:15.335
Don't leave me, Carl!
Otherwise, I gotta go talk to him.

06:15.408 --> 06:16.841
<i>Observe your yard, fatty!</i>

06:16.909 --> 06:19.070
Or you could go talk to him.

06:19.178 --> 06:20.167
No way.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.806
Yeah, you guys probably
have a lot in common.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.077
Look, he ain't my kind.

06:25.151 --> 06:28.052
Guess what, Carl?
He hates foreigners, too.

06:28.121 --> 06:31.852
<i>Nice yard. Take a look at it?
Completely rolled. It's nice!</i>

06:31.924 --> 06:33.755
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.920
Why don't you go find out?
I need to go back inside.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.463
<i>I rolled it, fat man.</i>

06:38.531 --> 06:40.897
<i>- Your yard. Check it out.
- What's up?</i>

06:40.967 --> 06:42.434
<i>Chicken butt.</i>

06:43.169 --> 06:45.729
<i>- You ever heard that before?
- Yeah, I heard it a lot.</i>

06:45.805 --> 06:47.796
<i>- In the second grade.
- It's a good one.</i>

06:47.874 --> 06:49.933
Could you define "good one," please?

06:50.009 --> 06:53.467
<i>Get me the business pages.
I want to give someone the business.</i>

06:53.780 --> 06:56.305
I'll be inside. Away from you.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.118
I gotta tell you.
A little of that guy goes a long way.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.983
You know, that's just so weird.

07:02.054 --> 07:05.148
I can't believe that he's
the all-knowing being of the universe.

07:05.224 --> 07:08.887
Yeah, all-being. He's doing
the 10-pound ball joke all wrong.

07:08.961 --> 07:12.124
<i>Is this the golf course? It is?</i>

07:12.799 --> 07:16.963
<i>Do you have 10-pound balls?
No? Then, how do you walk?</i>

07:18.404 --> 07:21.066
<i>How do you walk with a regular?</i>

07:23.976 --> 07:26.342
That doesn't make sense
any way you hear it.

07:26.412 --> 07:29.006
Not to mention
I unplugged the phone three hours ago.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.639
He's just putting on a show.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.980
Yeah, hi, we're watching you.

07:33.052 --> 07:37.079
- Maybe that's it. Maybe it's postmodern.
- Yeah, clearly from the village.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.681
You! Come here! You got a couple hours?

07:39.759 --> 07:42.751
Go ask him about the funny time
he ate all the boiled peanuts.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.821
- Is it funny?
- I thought I'd laugh till I die.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.191
- No, Meatwad, don't!
- Are you kidding me?

07:48.267 --> 07:51.668
You can't walk by him without getting
locked into some conversation...

07:51.737 --> 07:54.297
about what color
he would paint his bedroom...

07:54.373 --> 07:58.002
or that old chestnut,
"How I broke my arm. "

07:58.077 --> 08:01.410
- Let's go hear that one again!
- I got nothing else going on.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.381
<i>- Hi, this one time.
- No!</i>

08:03.449 --> 08:07.146
We're just gonna walk past him, don't
make eye contact, and go to the pool.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.744
<i>Excuse me, sir?</i>

08:10.323 --> 08:12.052
<i>Guys? Come on. Sir?</i>

08:13.493 --> 08:15.586
- Is he talking to us?
- Meatwad, don't.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.889
Yes.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.430
Leave him, he's dead to us.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.728
<i>This one time I was watching
this funny TVshow.</i>

08:20.800 --> 08:23.132
<i>Can't really remember it,
but it was really funny.</i>

08:23.202 --> 08:27.161
<i>Then I had an idea for a dream vacation.
I mean, I had the spread, okay?</i>

08:27.240 --> 08:30.403
<i>The beach, the hotel,
then I wrote all of this down.</i>

08:30.476 --> 08:33.410
<i>Wrote it all down,
really wrote it, like five pages.</i>

08:33.613 --> 08:35.547
<i>- ... lost it.
- You lost it?</i>

08:35.615 --> 08:37.412
<i>You want a dream vacation? Forget it.</i>

08:37.482 --> 08:42.113
This old boy, he gave me a job mopping up
late night at this children's apparel store.

08:42.922 --> 08:46.323
He said I made worser mess than it was.
That's discrimination.

08:46.392 --> 08:50.453
<i>I know what you mean. Because
this one time, I ate boiled peanuts.</i>

08:51.964 --> 08:55.456
Yeah, this one time, I rented me
a pressure washer, start this business...

08:55.535 --> 08:57.002
Meatwad Pressure Washing...

08:57.069 --> 08:59.560
but then I was told,
"You've got to have a license. "

08:59.639 --> 09:03.439
I says, "License? Hell, I ain't even
supposed to be in this country. "

09:03.509 --> 09:05.033
Then he got all mad.

09:05.111 --> 09:08.672
Meatwad's smart enough to know
how to get out of that gracefully, right?

09:08.748 --> 09:10.841
- No, he's not.
- Yeah, I know.

09:10.917 --> 09:14.409
For the love of all that's holy,
there's another one. Go under!

09:25.264 --> 09:28.324
How's the drain?
See what I'm talking about down there?

09:31.037 --> 09:32.231
Hi, fella.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.364
<i>You all seen my cousin around here?</i>

09:34.440 --> 09:37.170
<i>Telling this really long story
about how he hurt his foot...</i>

09:37.243 --> 09:39.609
<i>'cause he didn't wear shoes
when he went to the bank?</i>

09:39.679 --> 09:41.374
Really? At the bank?

09:41.447 --> 09:44.883
<i>- This one time, he went to the bank...
- No! He's right out front!</i>

09:44.951 --> 09:48.318
<i>Hey, how's it going, "wisdom cube"?</i>

09:49.422 --> 09:52.357
<i>I'm sorry. We didn't mean it.
I'm the real wisdom cube.</i>

09:52.425 --> 09:55.360
<i>This is my cousin,
the dumbass Ahedratron.</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:58.397
<i>- Say it, don't spray it.
- We usually try to strap him down.</i>

09:58.464 --> 10:00.796
<i>- Down clown town frown!
- Shut up!</i>

10:01.834 --> 10:04.701
<i>- So, you're the real wisdom cube!
- Yeah.</i>

10:04.770 --> 10:08.262
The source of all knowledge and wisdom?
You're him? The one?

10:08.341 --> 10:11.401
So let me ask you: What's at the end?
When we're dead, is it over?

10:11.477 --> 10:13.707
Do we go to heaven, or hell,
or rot in the ground?

10:13.779 --> 10:16.873
<i>Some things should not be known
by mortals.</i>

10:17.049 --> 10:19.244
<i>But I will leave you this flaming bag.</i>

10:19.318 --> 10:21.843
<i>Whenever you need
an answer for something...</i>

10:21.921 --> 10:24.583
<i>when you feel you are truly ready...</i>

10:24.924 --> 10:26.585
<i>put out this flame.</i>

10:26.659 --> 10:28.854
This flaming bag contains the answer?

10:28.928 --> 10:30.793
<i>Yeah, hunker down, you hairy dog.</i>

10:30.863 --> 10:34.594
Yep, hunker down, boy!
That's what it says on this bumper sticker.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.134
Bumper sticker? Let me see that!

10:36.202 --> 10:39.194
