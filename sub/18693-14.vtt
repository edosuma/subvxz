00:06.329 --> 00:07.825
Previously, on Shadowhunters...

00:08.985 --> 00:10.051
My parabatai.

00:10.086 --> 00:10.818
Alec Lightwood,

00:10.870 --> 00:13.354
You are now the new head
of the New York Institute.

00:13.406 --> 00:15.186
A Shadowhunter has been
mutilated and killed.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.294
It's not just a lone wolf,

00:16.315 --> 00:17.326
it's multiple Downworlders.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.910
This could be the
start of an uprising.

00:20.519 --> 00:22.453
Don't think this means anything.

00:22.488 --> 00:23.520
Kaelie did this.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.456
She had everything.
Werewolf claws,

00:25.491 --> 00:27.258
vampire fangs...

00:27.293 --> 00:29.404
She used it to make it look
like a Downworld uprising.

00:29.428 --> 00:30.628
The question is, why?

01:24.583 --> 01:26.216
Bravo.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.153
I had no idea I was in
the company of a virtuoso.

01:30.523 --> 01:32.289
Yeah, right.

01:32.325 --> 01:33.490
No, seriously, it's...

01:33.526 --> 01:34.558
extraordinary.

01:34.593 --> 01:36.527
I mean,
I wish I could play like that.

01:37.296 --> 01:39.363
Where did you learn?
Who taught you?

01:39.398 --> 01:41.165
Valentine,

01:41.200 --> 01:42.533
if you can believe that.

01:42.601 --> 01:44.268
Huh.

01:44.303 --> 01:48.405
I guess even an evil mastermind
can appreciate fine music.

01:50.209 --> 01:51.508
Yeah...

01:51.544 --> 01:54.211
maybe a little too much.

01:54.246 --> 01:56.480
Whenever I would make a mistake,

01:56.515 --> 01:59.249
he'd break the offending finger,

01:59.285 --> 02:02.353
then Iratze my hand and
have me start again.

02:03.389 --> 02:05.322
Well, I, uh...

02:05.358 --> 02:06.590
I'm surprised you still play.

02:09.161 --> 02:10.494
Only when the mood strikes.

02:10.529 --> 02:12.529
Is that why you're up so early?

02:13.632 --> 02:16.200
Or, wait,
did you never go to sleep?

02:16.235 --> 02:18.569
I just got back from
the Hunter's Moon.

02:18.604 --> 02:22.172
Ah, I'm guessing you weren't
there for a pint, were you?

02:24.021 --> 02:25.320
It's that bartender, isn't it?

02:26.412 --> 02:27.478
The beautiful one.

02:29.415 --> 02:30.547
It's nothing serious.

02:32.585 --> 02:35.219
So, I thought you had
a thing for Clary.

02:36.355 --> 02:38.255
Clary? Why would you say that?

02:38.290 --> 02:40.357
Well, I mean, you know...

02:40.393 --> 02:43.260
now that she's not your
sister, and she's...

02:43.295 --> 02:47.164
she's beautiful and fiery and...

02:47.199 --> 02:49.400
What is holding you back?

02:49.435 --> 02:52.236
Well, she has a boyfriend.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.304
She's moved on.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.506
I've moved on.

02:55.541 --> 02:57.508
It's ancient history.

03:00.546 --> 03:02.346
Sorry to interrupt.

03:02.381 --> 03:04.415
Alec is about to
make an announcement.

03:09.422 --> 03:11.255
We've lost seven of our own,

03:11.290 --> 03:13.424
but we can't allow a
single, radical Seelie

03:13.459 --> 03:16.126
to define the entire Downworld,
any more than we can allow

03:16.162 --> 03:18.562
Valentine to define
all Shadowhunters.

03:18.597 --> 03:20.497
So, to restore unity
with our allies,

03:20.533 --> 03:23.167
I will be hosting regular
Cabinet meetings here

03:23.202 --> 03:25.235
with the Downworld
leaders of New York.

03:25.271 --> 03:28.605
I'm all for unity.
But does he have to bring them here?

03:28.641 --> 03:30.240
What do you expect?

03:30.276 --> 03:31.475
He's dating a warlock.

03:31.510 --> 03:34.578
Still can't believe Alec
Lightwood is in charge.

03:34.613 --> 03:37.081
Just wait.

03:37.116 --> 03:40.350
In a week,
it'll be someone else.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.253
Hey. Show some respect.

03:45.357 --> 03:47.558
Please, let's make the
Downworlders feel welcome.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.565
Look at you.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.234
In charge for a week,
you're already shaking things up.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.448
I think this Cabinet
thing is a good idea.

03:59.472 --> 04:01.205
Yeah,
I'm not sure everyone agrees.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.250
All the more reason to do it.

04:02.274 --> 04:03.274
How can I help?

04:03.309 --> 04:05.209
Actually,
I need you and Jace for a mission.

04:06.212 --> 04:07.532
You're going to
the Seelie Court.

04:10.449 --> 04:11.415
Where is that?

04:11.450 --> 04:13.484
The nearest entrance
is in Central Park.

04:13.519 --> 04:15.285
But it's in another realm.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.519
Where the Seelie Queen lives.

04:16.555 --> 04:19.555
I requested an audience with
her to discuss Kaelie's crimes.

04:19.591 --> 04:23.494
But she said she'll only meet
with Valentine's experiments.

04:25.197 --> 04:27.431
Wow. Charming nickname.

04:27.466 --> 04:30.167
So, you think the Seelie Queen

04:30.202 --> 04:31.613
is responsible for
Kaelie's attacks?

04:31.637 --> 04:33.303
That's what I want
you to find out.

04:33.339 --> 04:34.505
It would make sense.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.473
Those murders weren't
exactly Kaelie's style.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.342
How did you know Kaelie?

04:40.312 --> 04:41.111
Book Club.

04:41.147 --> 04:42.312
You read?

04:43.482 --> 04:46.250
Yeah. Why does everyone find
that so hard to believe?

04:46.285 --> 04:47.351
Look. Focus.

04:47.386 --> 04:49.253
We need to find out
if she's complicit,

04:49.288 --> 04:51.288
An entire faction could
be turning against us.

04:51.323 --> 04:53.090
That shouldn't be too
hard, right?

04:53.125 --> 04:54.258
Seelies can't lie.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.393
Technically yes, but...

04:56.428 --> 04:58.262
after hundreds of
years of practice,

04:58.297 --> 05:00.197
they can expertly
manipulate the truth,

05:00.232 --> 05:01.565
and the Queen is the master.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.300
She's very dangerous.

05:03.335 --> 05:04.535
The entire realm is.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.164
More than one Shadowhunter
hasn't made it back.

05:08.374 --> 05:09.506
What could go wrong?

05:11.544 --> 05:14.244
But we're, uh...
Valentine's experiments, right?

05:14.280 --> 05:15.579
Don't mess with us.

05:17.550 --> 05:18.560
You're the only one
who hasn't agreed

05:18.584 --> 05:19.584
to join the Cabinet.

05:19.618 --> 05:21.218
Why should I?

05:21.253 --> 05:23.331
Well, you're the most respected
pack leader in New York.

05:23.355 --> 05:25.155
And as a former Shadowhunter,

05:25.191 --> 05:27.157
you understand what's
at stake for both sides.

05:27.193 --> 05:28.559
Yeah,

05:28.594 --> 05:31.161
that's exactly why I can
see this for what it is...

05:31.197 --> 05:32.429
an empty gesture.

05:32.464 --> 05:35.465
Look, after all the Downworld
has been through, Alec,

05:35.501 --> 05:37.267
we need change.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.435
Real change.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.370
I couldn't agree more.

05:40.406 --> 05:42.072
Then prove it.

05:42.107 --> 05:43.507
Destroy the Soul Sword.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.075
You know that the Clave

05:45.110 --> 05:46.670
will never destroy
a Mortal Instrument.

05:47.866 --> 05:49.546
Then Valentine needs to die.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.348
You're right.

05:51.383 --> 05:54.551
I promise I will
do everything I can

05:54.587 --> 05:57.187
to push for Valentine's
execution with the Clave.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.523
But this isn't just
about Valentine.

05:59.558 --> 06:02.559
It's about improving
Shadow World relations,

06:02.595 --> 06:04.394
and that's what this
Cabinet can do...

06:04.430 --> 06:06.530
but not without you.

06:10.402 --> 06:11.435
Just be prepared,

06:11.470 --> 06:13.215
'cause Jace is not going
to be happy you're here.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.282
When is he ever happy to see me?

06:14.306 --> 06:15.439
Well, that's true, but...

06:15.474 --> 06:17.207
What is he doing here?

06:17.243 --> 06:18.108
Well hello to you.

06:18.143 --> 06:19.343
I'm joining the mission.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.410
No, you're not.

06:20.446 --> 06:21.446
You weren't invited.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.146
I already told him that.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.559
But then I pointed out that you
can never have too much backup.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.450
You've seen my fighting
skills firsthand.

06:26.485 --> 06:28.485
There will be no fighting.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.154
If you hurt anyone
in the Queen's realm,

06:31.190 --> 06:32.300
she has every right to hurt you.

06:32.324 --> 06:34.324
This is a sensitive
political mission.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.326
It takes a certain charm.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.495
Well, I'll have you know,

06:38.530 --> 06:40.208
I was voted vice
president in eighth grade.

06:40.232 --> 06:42.132
And you do not win an
election without charm.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.267
So...

06:43.302 --> 06:45.369
Simon, this isn't middle school.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.536
This is life or death.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.272
Have you been to middle school?

06:49.308 --> 06:51.375
Look,

06:51.410 --> 06:53.277
Seelies have the
beauty of angels,

06:53.312 --> 06:54.456
and the viciousness of demons,

06:54.480 --> 06:56.391
and those opposing qualities
makes them unpredictable.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.349
A vampire or a werewolf,
they prefer to attack you head on,

06:59.385 --> 07:01.251
but Seelies,
they want to trick you

07:01.287 --> 07:02.527
into your own self-destruction.

07:04.290 --> 07:06.134
I mean, that's a little
dramatic, don't you think?

07:06.158 --> 07:07.424
I mean, aren't Seelies like...

07:07.459 --> 07:10.394
woodland hippies who
eat berries and ants?

07:10.429 --> 07:12.129
I thought the same about Kaelie.

07:12.164 --> 07:14.364
And who saved Clary from her?

07:15.467 --> 07:17.427
Jace, you're not gonna get
him to change his mind.

07:18.537 --> 07:20.170
We have to go.
Where is the entrance?

07:23.275 --> 07:24.275
There.

07:28.180 --> 07:30.147
The Seelie Court is in a creek?

07:30.182 --> 07:31.415
Not in it...

07:31.450 --> 07:32.450
through it.

07:39.391 --> 07:42.059
Last chance to turn back.

07:44.263 --> 07:46.096
Wherever you go I go, Fray.

07:53.505 --> 07:55.105
Whoa...

07:56.308 --> 07:58.141
After you, Mr. Vice President.

08:07.803 --> 08:09.990
So it's important that these
meetings might go smooth.

08:10.010 --> 08:11.010
It will.

08:11.297 --> 08:12.508
I'll be by your
side the whole time.

08:12.532 --> 08:13.731
Actually, I'd...

08:13.766 --> 08:15.466
rather you not.

08:15.501 --> 08:17.668
Have I done something wrong?

08:17.703 --> 08:19.370
No, not at all.

08:19.405 --> 08:20.449
It's just,
I don't want to be accused

08:20.473 --> 08:21.473
of any kind of...

08:21.507 --> 08:23.707
warlock favoritism.

08:25.311 --> 08:26.277
I see.

08:26.312 --> 08:28.512
Perhaps another warlock
should go instead.

08:28.548 --> 08:31.448
No, I...
I need you there, Magnus,

08:31.484 --> 08:33.417
but as a warlock representative,

08:33.452 --> 08:35.385
not as my boyfriend.

08:35.421 --> 08:36.687
Is that OK?

08:38.691 --> 08:39.623
Of course.

08:39.659 --> 08:41.325
It's best that we keep

08:41.360 --> 08:43.561
our personal and
professional lives separate.

08:45.464 --> 08:46.464
Thank you.

08:51.737 --> 08:53.571
Mom. What are you doing here?

08:54.473 --> 08:56.640
I wanted to congratulate
you on the promotion.

08:56.676 --> 08:59.643
I'm so pleased to see the
Lightwoods back in command.

09:02.481 --> 09:04.682
I always knew this
was your destiny.

09:04.717 --> 09:06.250
When you were little,

09:06.285 --> 09:07.451
I'd find you in here,

09:07.486 --> 09:09.320
sitting behind
your father's desk,

09:09.355 --> 09:11.422
writing out your
own memos in crayon.

09:11.457 --> 09:13.691
Well...

09:13.726 --> 09:15.459
here you are.

09:17.363 --> 09:18.883
Your father and I
couldn't be prouder.

09:19.632 --> 09:20.698
Speaking of Dad...

09:23.302 --> 09:23.801
what's the latest?

09:23.836 --> 09:25.536
Are you leaving him?

09:25.571 --> 09:27.371
It's complicated, Alec.

09:28.541 --> 09:29.541
It's not.

09:30.776 --> 09:32.309
He cheated on you.

09:32.345 --> 09:34.511
And it's over between us.

09:35.581 --> 09:36.714
But...

09:36.749 --> 09:39.350
we can't let our
marital problems

09:39.385 --> 09:40.662
undermine our political careers.

09:40.686 --> 09:43.587
The last thing we want is to
tarnish the Lightwood name.

09:45.625 --> 09:47.758
It's been through a lot worse.

09:51.497 --> 09:52.777
Look, I haven't told Izzy yet...

09:53.666 --> 09:55.733
but you know how
fast gossip spreads.

09:55.768 --> 09:57.668
She shouldn't hear
about it second-hand.

10:08.347 --> 10:09.658
You know,
for a dangerous mission,

10:09.682 --> 10:12.383
the Seelie Court's...
pretty romantic.

10:12.418 --> 10:14.818
It's like being dropped
inside a fairy tale.

10:14.854 --> 10:16.587
Which makes sense.

10:16.622 --> 10:18.322
Faeries do live here.

10:20.426 --> 10:21.426
Is that blood?

10:26.565 --> 10:28.271
Simon, get away from the tree!

10:29.813 --> 10:30.813
Get away from the tree!

10:33.406 --> 10:34.483
What the hell are you doing?

10:34.507 --> 10:36.340
Saving you. As usual.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.408
From a tree?

10:37.443 --> 10:39.276
That is called a kill tree.

10:39.312 --> 10:40.622
It would have wrapped
its vines around you

10:40.646 --> 10:42.313
and torn you limb from limb.

10:42.348 --> 10:43.659
Jace, what the hell
are you talking about?

10:43.683 --> 10:46.750
That tree almost tore
Simon's pretty face off.

10:46.786 --> 10:48.385
You think I'm pretty?

10:48.421 --> 10:50.387
Look, in the Seelie realm,

10:50.423 --> 10:52.567
it's not just the creatures that
are deadly. It's everything.

10:52.591 --> 10:54.358
If you want to survive,

10:54.393 --> 10:56.760
don't touch, eat,
or smell anything.

10:56.796 --> 10:58.696
No matter how small.

11:02.668 --> 11:05.569
♪ Is this hope, laying low ♪

11:07.573 --> 11:09.540
♪ Don't let the pain show ♪

11:11.577 --> 11:13.744
♪ It's the faraway light ♪

11:15.648 --> 11:17.681
♪ In the quiet of the night ♪

11:20.386 --> 11:21.719
Blowing off some steam?

11:21.754 --> 11:23.387
My mom's in town.

11:25.591 --> 11:27.658
Is that really such a bad thing?

11:29.595 --> 11:31.562
She doesn't know
about the yin fen.

11:35.668 --> 11:37.267
I don't know how she'll react.

11:37.303 --> 11:41.305
You know, it's...
possible that she might understand.

11:43.309 --> 11:44.341
You don't know my mom.

11:44.377 --> 11:46.744
She expects nothing
less than perfection.

11:48.314 --> 11:49.380
Always.

11:49.415 --> 11:52.349
Sometimes I wonder if I
could ever live up to it.

11:53.319 --> 11:54.363
You know,
maybe that's the attitude

11:54.387 --> 11:55.497
that got you hooked
in the first place?

11:55.521 --> 11:57.388
I don't want to disappoint her.

11:59.658 --> 12:01.525
Izzy, it's...

12:01.560 --> 12:03.594
it's OK to struggle.

12:06.499 --> 12:08.365
Life is a struggle.

12:08.401 --> 12:10.300
The point is that you are

12:10.336 --> 12:11.468
in recovery,

12:11.504 --> 12:13.337
and you are succeeding.

12:13.372 --> 12:15.739
Quite well, I might add.

12:15.775 --> 12:17.608
I'm not so sure.

12:26.552 --> 12:28.385
I am.

13:09.662 --> 13:11.762
I hear you want Valentine dead.

13:11.797 --> 13:15.532
I can get you in and out of
his cell undetected, tonight.

13:15.568 --> 13:16.633
Who is this?

13:16.669 --> 13:19.736
My anonymity is for your
protection as well as mine.

13:19.772 --> 13:20.782
If you have access to Valentine,

13:20.806 --> 13:22.506
why not kill him yourself?

13:22.541 --> 13:24.508
I'm no match against Valentine.

13:24.543 --> 13:27.444
But as his former
parabatai, you are.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.445
Luke?

13:28.481 --> 13:29.713
Ollie!

13:29.748 --> 13:30.714
What are you doing here?

13:30.749 --> 13:33.550
I needed your help with
something for work.

13:33.586 --> 13:35.586
What is this place?

13:35.621 --> 13:36.520
A drug den?

13:36.555 --> 13:37.688
It's a Chinese restaurant.

13:37.723 --> 13:39.623
Looks like a drug den.

13:39.658 --> 13:42.426
Ollie, is this an emergency?

13:42.461 --> 13:43.627
Not exactly.

13:43.662 --> 13:45.729
I'm having trouble with
some of my paperwork.

13:45.764 --> 13:48.365
Look, I can't help you tonight.
I'm busy.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.501
Busy eating alone?

13:50.536 --> 13:52.436
I... have a date!

13:52.471 --> 13:53.403
A date?

13:53.439 --> 13:54.404
Yeah. Fantastic!

13:54.440 --> 13:56.540
Good for you. Are you...
taking her here?

13:56.575 --> 13:57.741
Uh...

13:57.776 --> 13:59.443
No. Not anymore.

13:59.478 --> 14:00.744
She's allergic to M.S.G.

14:00.779 --> 14:03.580
Look, first thing tomorrow,
I'll help you out.

14:03.616 --> 14:04.581
I gotta go. OK?

14:04.617 --> 14:06.617
OK. Use protection!

14:06.652 --> 14:08.552
And I don't mean your gun.

14:37.550 --> 14:40.484
It's so beautiful.

14:40.519 --> 14:41.718
Don't let it blind you.

14:43.455 --> 14:44.521
Let's go.

15:00.306 --> 15:01.306
Welcome.

15:02.308 --> 15:03.373
Welcome.

15:08.380 --> 15:09.580
Jace, my stele. Our weapons.

15:10.283 --> 15:12.360
Yeah.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.120
You'll get them back
when you leave the Court.

15:17.489 --> 15:18.722
Your majesty.

15:20.392 --> 15:21.425
What a rare honour.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.393
Wait, that's the Queen?

15:23.429 --> 15:25.362
Why is the vampire here?

15:25.397 --> 15:27.297
He was not invited.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.565
He's with me.

15:29.668 --> 15:31.635
My lady,
Simon has proven himself

15:31.670 --> 15:34.504
a worthy warrior
and a loyal friend.

15:34.540 --> 15:36.273
We insisted he be here with us.

15:36.308 --> 15:38.575
Anything you have to say to
us, you can say to him.

15:40.412 --> 15:41.511
Very well.

15:41.547 --> 15:43.280
The vampire can stay.

15:43.315 --> 15:46.283
You are as generous
as you are lovely.

15:50.456 --> 15:51.696
Set an extra place at the table

15:51.724 --> 15:53.523
for our third guest.

16:01.634 --> 16:02.634
This is going to be fun.

16:12.315 --> 16:13.814
We're OK...

16:13.964 --> 16:14.964
Right this way, please.

16:15.150 --> 16:16.150
I must say,

16:16.337 --> 16:18.303
when I received your
invitation I was skeptical.

16:18.339 --> 16:19.571
I still am.

16:19.607 --> 16:22.474
Though your sister's presence
is always heartening.

16:22.509 --> 16:24.309
As is yours, Meliorn.

16:24.345 --> 16:25.410
Well, tonight,

16:25.446 --> 16:27.613
I hope to erase that skepticism.

16:30.284 --> 16:31.650
Raphael...

16:31.685 --> 16:33.485
I wasn't sure I'd see you here.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.654
Alec is the new head
of the Institute,

16:35.689 --> 16:38.457
and he wanted me here to make
the Downworlders feel welcome.

16:38.492 --> 16:41.260
Seems like such a
waste of my skills.

16:41.295 --> 16:42.327
No, I disagree.

16:42.363 --> 16:44.229
I feel very welcome.

16:44.265 --> 16:45.464
I'm glad you're here.

16:45.499 --> 16:47.399
Me too.

16:52.373 --> 16:55.173
Lovely to see you,
Mr. Lightwood.

16:55.209 --> 16:56.408
And you, Mr. Bane.

16:56.443 --> 16:58.176
Thank you for taking the time.

16:58.212 --> 16:59.378
I wouldn't miss it.

16:59.413 --> 17:02.180
I have tremendous respect for
the new Head of the Institute.

17:09.623 --> 17:11.356
You won't regret this.

17:11.625 --> 17:12.625
I hope not.

17:16.396 --> 17:17.396
Lucian.

17:18.299 --> 17:20.332
I just wanted to say,
I am so sorry about Jocelyn.

17:20.567 --> 17:23.167
I feel terrible that I couldn't
be at her Rite of Mourning.

17:23.203 --> 17:24.336
I couldn't either.

17:24.371 --> 17:26.371
The Clave banned all
Downworlders from attending.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.543
It's nice to see you, Maryse.

17:34.481 --> 17:36.481
You look great.

17:36.517 --> 17:38.383
How's Max?

17:38.419 --> 17:39.484
Alive, thanks to us.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.120
And more eager to
train than ever.

17:42.156 --> 17:43.196
That's putting it lightly.

17:43.223 --> 17:45.424
The little devil
judo-flipped me to the floor.

17:47.261 --> 17:48.193
And you are?

17:48.228 --> 17:50.128
Sebastian Verlac.

17:50.164 --> 17:52.364
I'm working security tonight
at the Cabinet meeting.

17:52.399 --> 17:55.267
Sebastian's a transfer
from the London Institute.

17:55.302 --> 17:57.235
He's been helping me tutor Max.

17:57.271 --> 17:59.438
And how do you know Isabelle?

17:59.473 --> 18:02.370
Raphael is the leader

18:02.450 --> 18:03.408
of the Brooklyn clan.

18:03.444 --> 18:06.178
Our paths cross occasionally.

18:06.213 --> 18:07.213
For work.

18:08.248 --> 18:09.348
Speaking of work,

18:09.383 --> 18:11.183
I should probably
join the group.

18:12.619 --> 18:14.152
It's nice to meet
you, Sebastian.

18:14.188 --> 18:15.253
Pleasure.

18:34.274 --> 18:35.452
I thought you said
she was ancient.

18:35.476 --> 18:37.175
She hasn't even hit puberty.

18:38.479 --> 18:39.511
She is ancient.

18:39.546 --> 18:42.414
She uses Seelie magic
to manipulate her age.

18:42.449 --> 18:43.582
Genius!

18:43.617 --> 18:46.284
She tries to seem all innocent and
cute, but really she's...

18:46.320 --> 18:47.452
Hungry?

18:49.556 --> 18:52.324
That's very kind,
but we really should discuss business.

18:52.359 --> 18:54.126
Business is boring.

18:54.194 --> 18:55.360
That's why I sent a proxy

18:55.396 --> 18:57.229
to your Downworlder
Cabinet Meeting.

18:57.264 --> 19:01.233
I'd like to know more
about Valentine's children.

19:01.268 --> 19:04.202
Child, actually.
I'm the only one.

19:04.238 --> 19:06.138
Are you sure?

19:06.173 --> 19:08.206
I'm not Valentine's son.

19:08.242 --> 19:12.411
Yet, the same blood runs
through both your veins.

19:12.446 --> 19:14.179
The blood of the angel.

19:14.214 --> 19:16.148
Please, show me what it can do.

19:18.318 --> 19:19.384
Don't be shy.

19:19.420 --> 19:20.780
We're still learning
how it works.

19:22.289 --> 19:23.455
Are you?

19:24.425 --> 19:25.490
And you, vampire.

19:25.559 --> 19:28.226
Are you still learning
to walk in the sun?

19:28.262 --> 19:30.429
Wow,
word travels fast down here.

19:30.464 --> 19:32.197
It does.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.601
I hear whispers from the
birds, the bees and the bugs.

19:36.637 --> 19:39.237
They're all in my service.

19:39.273 --> 19:40.305
So was Kaelie.

19:40.340 --> 19:41.573
Were you surprised to hear

19:41.608 --> 19:43.508
one of your knights was
killing Shadowhunters?

19:43.544 --> 19:45.210
Were you?

19:45.245 --> 19:47.245
Kaelie was your lover.

19:47.281 --> 19:49.347
Book club, huh?

19:51.218 --> 19:52.218
I was surprised.

19:53.220 --> 19:55.353
Kaelie didn't seem
capable of such brutality.

19:55.389 --> 19:57.422
Precisely why she made
an effective killer.

19:57.458 --> 20:00.459
The sweeter the honey,
the deadlier the trap.

20:01.462 --> 20:02.627
Did Kaelie kill on her own,

20:02.663 --> 20:04.529
or was she working
with someone else?

20:11.572 --> 20:12.471
Another knight helped.

20:12.506 --> 20:14.306
But I took care of him.

20:15.576 --> 20:17.476
By "took care of," you mean...

20:17.511 --> 20:20.212
Dead, dead, dead.

20:26.587 --> 20:28.687
I'd like a moment alone
with the Daylighter.

20:28.722 --> 20:30.355
- Alone?
- With Simon?

20:31.658 --> 20:33.592
My lady,
perhaps you could discuss here.

20:33.627 --> 20:35.527
We prefer not to be separated.

20:35.562 --> 20:37.462
Don't worry.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.267
I'll bring him back with
all his limbs attached.

20:44.204 --> 20:45.337
OK.

20:47.574 --> 20:49.407
It's OK, Clary. I'll be fine.

20:50.611 --> 20:53.245
So, what does this
Downworld Cabinet even mean?

20:53.280 --> 20:55.247
It means creating
total transparency

20:55.282 --> 20:56.559
about all Shadowhunter decisions

20:56.583 --> 20:57.627
that involve the Downworld.

20:57.651 --> 21:00.043
The goal is to have
weekly meetings here

21:00.243 --> 21:02.654
to discuss any updates,
questions, concerns.

21:02.689 --> 21:05.290
Well, I applaud Mr. Lightwood

21:05.325 --> 21:06.591
for his progressive thinking.

21:06.627 --> 21:08.593
Because you're totally unbiased.

21:10.297 --> 21:11.496
Alec, you're not the first

21:11.532 --> 21:12.675
to attempt something like this,

21:12.699 --> 21:14.299
but it never works out

21:14.334 --> 21:16.501
because the Clave is not
willing to compromise.

21:16.537 --> 21:17.602
But I am.

21:17.638 --> 21:20.539
In time, we will be able
to reason with the Clave.

21:20.574 --> 21:21.673
I'm sure of it.

21:21.708 --> 21:23.375
And what about Valentine?

21:23.410 --> 21:26.244
Can this cabinet appeal
for his execution?

21:26.280 --> 21:28.380
If this is going to work,

21:28.415 --> 21:30.515
we can't start with
the impossible.

21:30.551 --> 21:31.694
Well that's kind
of hard to believe

21:31.718 --> 21:33.552
considering the man that
massacred our people

21:33.587 --> 21:35.453
is sitting in a cell
beneath our feet.

21:35.489 --> 21:37.455
Luke, I know you're upset,

21:37.491 --> 21:40.158
but we have to be
diplomatic about this.

21:40.193 --> 21:41.326
Diplomacy gets us nowhere.

21:41.361 --> 21:43.161
Nothing has changed in 20 years.

21:43.196 --> 21:45.375
The werewolves aren't the
only ones with their vendetta.

21:45.399 --> 21:47.432
Everyone has a reason
to want Valentine dead.

21:47.467 --> 21:48.500
I more than anyone.

21:48.535 --> 21:50.235
And why is that?

21:50.270 --> 21:52.637
You said total transparency.

21:56.543 --> 21:57.543
You remember Azazel?

21:59.279 --> 22:00.645
Before we sent him back to Hell,

22:00.681 --> 22:03.615
he used... demonic magic

22:03.650 --> 22:06.484
to put Valentine's
mind in my body.

22:06.520 --> 22:09.354
So Valentine was walking freely,

22:09.389 --> 22:10.522
wearing your face?

22:10.557 --> 22:12.657
Yes, but not for long.

22:12.693 --> 22:14.659
He's now back in his cell,

22:14.695 --> 22:15.660
for good.

22:15.696 --> 22:17.295
This is what I'm talking about.

22:17.331 --> 22:19.264
The Clave has to
know about this.

22:19.299 --> 22:21.333
If Valentine was able to escape,

22:21.368 --> 22:22.567
they have to execute him.

22:22.603 --> 22:24.202
The Clave already knows.

22:24.237 --> 22:26.237
It won't change their minds.

22:26.273 --> 22:27.672
What other options do we have?

22:30.310 --> 22:31.350
I need to talk to my pack.

22:31.378 --> 22:33.445
Excuse me while I
make a phone call.

22:36.249 --> 22:37.315
Let's take a recess.

22:42.456 --> 22:44.422
So, have you
reconsidered my offer?

22:46.285 --> 22:47.318
I'm in.

22:51.798 --> 22:53.531
I've never met anyone like you.

22:54.467 --> 22:56.734
And I've been alive for a
very, very long time.

22:58.067 --> 22:59.211
So you're not mad that I'm here?

22:59.235 --> 23:01.068
On the contrary.

23:01.104 --> 23:03.215
I was hoping your friends
would invite you along tonight.

23:03.239 --> 23:05.172
The Daylighter rock star.

23:06.142 --> 23:07.208
It certainly is a niche.

23:07.243 --> 23:10.177
I've mentored some of the
greatest Seelie musicians.

23:10.213 --> 23:13.414
Ever heard of Sia? Or... Bjork?

23:13.449 --> 23:14.382
Huh.

23:14.417 --> 23:16.283
I can help you too.

23:16.319 --> 23:18.185
You can visit my Court any time.

23:18.221 --> 23:21.222
Play your music as my nymphs
tend to your every need.

23:22.558 --> 23:24.125
Why would you do that for me?

23:24.160 --> 23:25.426
Because I want to be friends.

23:25.461 --> 23:27.128
Allies.

23:27.163 --> 23:29.163
I feel darker times are
coming, Simon,

23:29.198 --> 23:31.098
and my feelings
are rarely wrong.

23:33.102 --> 23:34.368
Oh, can I call you Simon?

23:34.404 --> 23:37.338
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Go for it.

23:37.373 --> 23:40.341
You and I may need each
other, Simon.

23:40.376 --> 23:43.044
We cannot trust
the Shadowhunters.

23:43.079 --> 23:45.112
You mean the Circle.

23:45.148 --> 23:48.082
You're still so young.

23:48.151 --> 23:50.017
Shadowhunters are all alike.

23:50.053 --> 23:53.354
Their mortality makes them
fickle, selfish, weak.

23:53.389 --> 23:56.323
In the end,
they always choose their own kind.

23:56.359 --> 23:58.192
And so must we.

23:58.227 --> 24:00.294
I can't speak for
all Shadowhunters,

24:00.329 --> 24:02.163
but I know Clary's
nothing like that.

24:02.198 --> 24:03.364
She would never turn on me.

24:04.262 --> 24:06.442
This is about more than Clary.

24:06.569 --> 24:08.269
This is about the
fate of the Downworld.

24:09.145 --> 24:10.038
There's a reason why

24:10.085 --> 24:11.250
my people have survived longer

24:11.274 --> 24:12.794
than any other
creature on this Earth.

24:14.143 --> 24:15.743
We know when to choose
the winning side.

24:17.447 --> 24:18.479
Well, I'm sorry.

24:18.514 --> 24:20.181
You've got the wrong guy.

24:21.150 --> 24:22.150
No I don't.

24:23.186 --> 24:24.418
I want to be friends, Simon.

24:25.321 --> 24:26.353
And I'm willing to wait.

24:26.389 --> 24:28.389
I'm a very patient woman.

24:30.460 --> 24:33.294
If we can look at it
tomorrow, and um...

24:33.329 --> 24:34.800
I don't like that guy.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.464
Who, Jace?

24:36.499 --> 24:38.332
That's not Jace.

24:38.367 --> 24:41.035
All Shadowhunters
look the same to me.

24:42.271 --> 24:44.472
Except Isabelle, of course.

24:46.442 --> 24:48.209
You still care for
her, don't you?

24:55.284 --> 24:57.318
So, What are your
intentions with Isabelle?

24:59.122 --> 25:00.132
I'm sorry. Are you serious?

25:00.156 --> 25:02.289
When it comes to her, always.

25:04.460 --> 25:07.094
My only intention
is to be her friend.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.362
I don't believe you.

25:08.397 --> 25:10.264
I see the way you look at her.

25:11.234 --> 25:13.167
The way you follow
at a distance...

25:14.403 --> 25:15.536
like a predator.

25:15.571 --> 25:19.273
That is rich, coming from the
guy who used to feed on her.

25:20.543 --> 25:23.043
See, I always knew she was
going to a vampire for venom,

25:23.079 --> 25:24.156
but it doesn't take a genius

25:24.180 --> 25:26.280
to see that you are
still addicted to her.

25:26.315 --> 25:27.481
I care about her.

25:27.517 --> 25:30.251
Oh, you care about her. OK.

25:30.286 --> 25:33.087
If that is true,

25:33.122 --> 25:34.882
then you need to stay
the hell away from her.

25:36.492 --> 25:38.133
You are a reminder

25:38.173 --> 25:39.573
of the darkest
moments of her life.

25:39.742 --> 25:41.775
A constant temptation.

25:46.435 --> 25:49.370
You are bad for her, Raphael.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.013
Inside the bottom drawer,

25:59.048 --> 26:00.080
you'll find a dagger

26:00.116 --> 26:01.260
and the code to
Valentine's cell.

26:01.284 --> 26:02.294
How much time will I
have once I'm down there?

26:02.318 --> 26:03.384
Three minutes.

26:03.419 --> 26:05.459
Then the cameras turn back
on and the guard returns.

26:05.488 --> 26:07.087
I'm gonna need five, not three.

26:07.123 --> 26:09.114
And turning off the
cameras is too suspicious.

26:09.187 --> 26:11.178
The feeds need to be looped.

26:11.291 --> 26:12.259
Those are my
conditions or I walk.

26:12.295 --> 26:15.229
Your five minutes start now.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.498
Lucian?

26:17.533 --> 26:19.188
Where are you going?

26:21.137 --> 26:22.297
Just needed to clear my head.

26:23.251 --> 26:25.304
I know you have your doubts,

26:25.320 --> 26:26.620
but I'm so glad you've decided

26:26.675 --> 26:28.103
to go ahead with it all.

26:29.078 --> 26:30.311
For Clary, your pack...

26:30.346 --> 26:31.245
and Jocelyn.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.314
What are you talking about?

26:33.349 --> 26:35.482
The Downworld Cabinet.
Alec would hate

26:35.518 --> 26:37.117
that I'm saying
anything about it.

26:37.153 --> 26:38.263
He doesn't want me involved,

26:38.287 --> 26:40.321
but it is a wonderful idea

26:40.356 --> 26:42.056
and I...
just hope you won't hold

26:42.091 --> 26:43.057
his last name against him.

26:43.092 --> 26:44.458
I won't. Now if that's all...

26:44.493 --> 26:46.026
Um, Lucian...

26:46.062 --> 26:48.262
lately,
I have been trying to reconnect

26:48.297 --> 26:49.430
with the people I've hurt,

26:49.765 --> 26:52.432
and you are one of those people.

26:52.985 --> 26:55.755
We were good friends,
back in Idris,

26:56.055 --> 26:58.105
and then...
I turned against you,

26:58.140 --> 26:59.140
like everyone else,

26:59.175 --> 27:02.042
and I am so sorry.

27:03.118 --> 27:05.385
Maryse,
I can't do this right now.

27:10.453 --> 27:12.119
We should never
have let Simon come.

27:12.154 --> 27:14.121
He didn't exactly
give us a choice.

27:15.458 --> 27:17.258
And you know,
you can't really blame him.

27:18.327 --> 27:20.261
If I were him,
I'd never leave your side either.

27:25.468 --> 27:26.433
Is everything OK?

27:26.469 --> 27:28.202
Great! We need to go right now.

27:28.237 --> 27:29.854
Hey! Hey! Wait!

27:30.139 --> 27:31.272
Your majesty,

27:31.340 --> 27:33.140
with your permission,
we should get going.

27:33.175 --> 27:34.508
But you've only just arrived.

27:37.380 --> 27:39.213
It's futile to struggle.

27:40.149 --> 27:41.282
Vitis veritas.

27:41.317 --> 27:43.984
Enchanted vines
that only obey me.

27:47.356 --> 27:48.989
What are you doing? Let them go!

27:49.025 --> 27:50.335
But they killed
several of my kind.

27:50.359 --> 27:52.474
What? We didn't kill anyone!

27:52.588 --> 27:53.601
She can't lie.

27:53.621 --> 27:54.977
Your majesty,
you must be mistaken.

27:55.001 --> 27:56.270
I told you,

27:56.363 --> 27:59.159
the birds, bees, bugs,
they're all in my service.

28:01.203 --> 28:02.436
The gnats at the kill tree.

28:02.471 --> 28:04.471
What, that... that bug I killed?

28:05.374 --> 28:07.274
But that can't seriously mean...

28:07.310 --> 28:09.043
Their deaths require justice.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.445
Unless, of course,
you'd rather play a game.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.213
- What kind of game?
- A game sounds better.

28:13.249 --> 28:14.348
It's simple, really.

28:14.383 --> 28:16.183
All I ask is a kiss.

28:16.218 --> 28:18.218
You want one of us to kiss you?

28:18.254 --> 28:20.054
The game isn't for me.

28:20.089 --> 28:21.288
It's for you, Clary.

28:21.324 --> 28:24.158
The kiss that will set them free

28:24.193 --> 28:26.160
is the kiss you most desire.

28:29.231 --> 28:31.031
I suggest you move quickly.

28:33.235 --> 28:34.413
Once the vines
reach their necks,

28:34.437 --> 28:37.404
the boys will be
dead, dead, dead.

28:40.142 --> 28:41.075
Jace was wrong.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.387
This is exactly
like middle school.

28:42.411 --> 28:44.869
Clary,
just kiss me so we can go home.

28:56.392 --> 28:57.469
Why are the vines still here?

28:57.493 --> 28:59.093
Why do you think?

28:59.161 --> 29:00.227
I did what you asked.

29:01.739 --> 29:05.006
♪ I don't wanna leave ♪

29:05.134 --> 29:06.400
Clary?

29:06.435 --> 29:08.168
♪ Here without you ♪

29:08.204 --> 29:10.437
You can fool yourself,
but not the vitis veritas.

29:13.275 --> 29:15.142
Clary!

29:15.177 --> 29:21.281
♪ I don't want to
lose part of me ♪

29:22.151 --> 29:23.151

29:25.154 --> 29:28.389

30:18.009 --> 30:19.283
I told you, Daylighter.

30:19.922 --> 30:22.533
They always choose
their own kind.

30:22.729 --> 30:24.162
Why the hell would you do that?

30:24.826 --> 30:26.480
It's our lives, not some game!

30:26.507 --> 30:27.650
Best to be completely honest,

30:27.674 --> 30:28.707
don't you think?

30:28.742 --> 30:30.642
There's nothing
honest about that.

30:30.677 --> 30:31.643
Your highness,

30:31.678 --> 30:33.412
are we free to go?

30:33.447 --> 30:34.713
Oh yes.

30:34.748 --> 30:36.648
It seems one of you already has.

30:39.653 --> 30:40.685
Simon...

30:49.730 --> 30:50.730
How's the meeting going?

30:51.912 --> 30:53.498
Having its ups and downs.

30:55.402 --> 30:56.468
Are you OK?

30:59.807 --> 31:02.374
Isabelle,
you need to know something.

31:04.224 --> 31:05.390
Robert had an affair.

31:08.749 --> 31:10.482
So he finally told you.

31:14.488 --> 31:16.755
I overheard one of his
phone conversations.

31:18.358 --> 31:19.524
I wanted to tell you badly,

31:19.560 --> 31:21.626
but I figured it wasn't
my secret to tell.

31:24.731 --> 31:25.764
I didn't even tell Alec.

31:26.700 --> 31:28.600
Oh Isabelle. You poor thing.

31:28.635 --> 31:29.635
Leave him.

31:31.805 --> 31:32.805
Max is with us now.

31:33.707 --> 31:35.540
Mom, you deserve to be happy.

31:36.410 --> 31:37.609
So do you.

31:37.644 --> 31:40.278
Despite this,
despite everything,

31:40.314 --> 31:41.746
I hope you don't
give up on love.

31:41.782 --> 31:44.449
I hope you fight for it,

31:44.485 --> 31:45.550
like your brother.

31:50.524 --> 31:52.290
I'm so relieved this is all out.

31:53.560 --> 31:55.560
From now on, no more secrets.

32:01.668 --> 32:03.668
After that demon attack
in the Institute,

32:03.704 --> 32:06.438
the pain in my
shoulder was so bad.

32:06.473 --> 32:08.540
Healing runes weren't enough.

32:08.575 --> 32:10.442
I wasn't able to fight the same.

32:12.579 --> 32:14.379
So I started using yin fen.

32:15.349 --> 32:16.481
By the Angel...

32:16.517 --> 32:17.517
I didn't do it for long.

32:17.551 --> 32:19.111
Just long enough to
know I had to stop.

32:20.687 --> 32:23.355
With some help,
I got through withdrawal

32:23.390 --> 32:25.724
and I'm in recovery now.

32:27.594 --> 32:28.793
I'm gonna be OK.

32:33.534 --> 32:34.733
I am so sorry.

32:34.768 --> 32:36.468
This is all my fault.

32:37.671 --> 32:39.404
No, Mama. It's mine.

32:39.439 --> 32:40.605
I've been so hard on you.

32:40.641 --> 32:42.407
Put so much pressure.

32:42.442 --> 32:44.342
Of course you
needed a release...

32:45.479 --> 32:48.346
Sometimes our angelic duty

32:48.382 --> 32:50.715
seems to...
overshadow everything else.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.652
We forget we're human, too.

33:00.427 --> 33:01.726
Let me guess.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.762
You wanna know where the Cup is.

33:03.797 --> 33:05.597
I don't give a
damn about the Cup.

33:06.800 --> 33:07.732
You took my sister,

33:07.768 --> 33:09.434
and you killed Jocelyn.

33:13.674 --> 33:15.307
I understand your concerns.

33:15.342 --> 33:15.774
When Luke gets back,

33:15.809 --> 33:16.708
we can discuss

33:16.743 --> 33:18.677
a neutral location for meetings.

33:18.712 --> 33:20.072
Might I speak to
you for a moment?

33:22.516 --> 33:23.516
Excuse me.

33:27.621 --> 33:28.520
What's going on?

33:28.555 --> 33:29.555
I saw Lucian Graymark

33:29.590 --> 33:30.555
heading to the Annex

33:30.591 --> 33:31.556
a few minutes ago.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.592
Now I know there's
a secondary door

33:33.627 --> 33:34.526
to the sub-cells through there,

33:34.561 --> 33:35.805
so I checked the security feeds.

33:35.829 --> 33:38.630
Luke disappears
between the cameras.

33:40.767 --> 33:42.367
Someone's looping the footage?

33:42.402 --> 33:43.402
Yeah.

33:58.552 --> 34:00.630
You're going to kill me like
the feral animal that you are?

34:00.654 --> 34:01.720
No.

34:01.755 --> 34:03.421
I'm gonna kill you like a man.

34:06.493 --> 34:08.326
I'm gonna start a little fight.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.498
Ah!

34:27.681 --> 34:29.447
You don't get to die today.

34:29.483 --> 34:32.717
Do I know you?

34:50.411 --> 34:52.551
Why would you try
and kill Valentine?

34:52.650 --> 34:54.895
Well, he escaped once.
He can do it again.

34:55.043 --> 34:56.146
And if your plan failed,

34:56.176 --> 34:58.216
it would have endangered
everyone in this Institute.

34:58.503 --> 35:00.503
The security logs
have been wiped clean.

35:00.530 --> 35:02.385
There's no data on
whose clearance was used

35:02.440 --> 35:03.473
to unlock the Annex door.

35:06.317 --> 35:07.283
You really have no idea

35:07.305 --> 35:08.449
who this mystery accomplice was?

35:08.473 --> 35:09.272
No.

35:09.294 --> 35:10.394
They used a burner phone

35:10.429 --> 35:11.595
and a voice modulator.

35:11.630 --> 35:13.463
No discernible speech pattern.

35:13.499 --> 35:15.298
Hell,
I can't even give you a gender.

35:15.334 --> 35:16.678
But they had to be
inside the Institute

35:16.702 --> 35:18.368
in order to loop the
cameras, right?

35:18.404 --> 35:20.682
Everyone in this Institute has
been affected by Valentine.

35:20.706 --> 35:22.439
It could be anyone.

35:22.474 --> 35:23.474
We have nothing.

35:24.643 --> 35:25.676
Well, you got me.

35:25.711 --> 35:27.577
The Clave would love
to put me behind bars.

35:27.613 --> 35:28.712
And they'd be right to.

35:28.747 --> 35:31.415
What you did tonight
was reckless.

35:31.450 --> 35:33.417
Innocent personnel
could've been hurt.

35:35.387 --> 35:36.507
You deserve to be in prison.

35:40.459 --> 35:41.625
But...

35:44.430 --> 35:46.396
Consider this your get
out of jail free card.

35:49.085 --> 35:50.085
Why is that?

35:51.670 --> 35:53.314
Because I'm trying to
prove to the Downworld

35:53.338 --> 35:54.716
that we don't see
them as an enemy...

35:54.740 --> 35:56.606
and arresting you would
prove the opposite.

35:57.509 --> 35:58.653
Look, so what do we
do about the mole?

35:58.677 --> 36:00.343
We track him down.

36:00.379 --> 36:02.646
One thing's for sure...

36:02.681 --> 36:04.481
Valentine's not safe here.

36:07.519 --> 36:08.552
Raphael!

36:08.587 --> 36:10.420
The meeting's over.
I have to talk to my clan.

36:10.456 --> 36:11.856
I just need to say
something first.

36:15.360 --> 36:17.561
We've been through a lot
together, haven't we?

36:17.596 --> 36:20.330
And we keep coming
back to each other,

36:20.365 --> 36:22.332
Because of this amazing
connection we have.

36:28.507 --> 36:29.673

36:38.584 --> 36:39.449
I don't care about that.

36:39.485 --> 36:40.485
I care about you.

36:40.519 --> 36:41.585
It's not about that.

36:42.721 --> 36:45.255
Our whole relationship was
built on our addiction.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.390
What if that's what's
drawing us together?

36:47.426 --> 36:48.458
And what if it isn't?

36:48.494 --> 36:50.627

ourselves to find out.

All it takes is one
moment of weakness,

37:04.543 --> 37:06.276

So the Seelie Queen
didn't help Kaelie,

38:14.713 --> 38:16.279
it was actually a Seelie Knight,

38:16.315 --> 38:17.347
who is now dead.

38:17.382 --> 38:18.548
Yeah. The Queen's hands

38:18.584 --> 38:20.283
are technically
clean in this one.

38:20.319 --> 38:22.285

I don't know.

Right.

No. I'm, uh... I'm fine.

Hey.

38:55.520 --> 38:56.586
Look, we should talk.

38:56.622 --> 38:58.321
About what just happened.

38:59.424 --> 39:00.490
I can't.

39:14.573 --> 39:16.506
Clary, I just had the worst...

Oh...

- Latte for the lady.

- Hi.
- Hey.

39:44.536 --> 39:45.669
What're you looking at?

39:45.704 --> 39:46.704
Uh, there.

39:47.639 --> 39:48.538
In the shadow.

39:48.573 --> 39:51.274
Am I crazy, Sam, or is that...

39:51.310 --> 39:52.310
A wolf?

39:52.344 --> 39:53.344
Yeah!

40:46.691 --> 40:48.557
Look at all this
mess you've made.

40:52.304 --> 40:53.370
Keep quiet...

40:55.374 --> 40:57.474

40:59.478 --> 41:01.378
And you wouldn't like that.
