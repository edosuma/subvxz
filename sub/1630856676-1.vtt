00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:56.658
Imperial Diary. Year 10,191.
Third comment.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:03.430
The battle for Arrakis
took everyone by surprise.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.667
There were no witnesses.

00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:10.805
The Harkonnen operation
was perpetrated overnight,

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:14.709
without warning
or declaration of war.

00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:19.413
By morning,
the Atreides were no more.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:22.316
All died in the dark.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:32.794
And the Emperor said...

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:37.363
nothing.

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.302
Since that night, my father
has not been the same.

00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:44.605
Nor have I.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.811
His inaction
is difficult for me to accept.

00:01:49.844 --> 00:01:52.747
For, I know he loved
Duke Leto Atreides like a son.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.922
But my father's
always been guided

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:05.325
by the calculus of power.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.328
This would not be the first time the
Harkonnens have done his dirty work.

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:19.406
In the shadows of Arrakis
lie many secrets...

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:24.277
but the darkest of them all
may remain.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.615
The end of House Atreides.

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:46.868
Sister, Father is dead.

00:02:48.503 --> 00:02:50.303
Shouldn't you go back
to the stars,

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:52.304
be with him?

00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:57.912
I'm afraid I won't have enough
time to fix things before your coming.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.717
This world is beyond cruelty.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.985
Stay here.

00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:03.611
Never stand with your back
towards the open.

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:05.288
How many times do I have
to tell you that, huh?

00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:07.681
You okay?

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:09.950
- Yeah.
- How 'bout her?

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:13.019
She's fine.

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:23.764
They do not usually
venture this deep.

00:09:23.798 --> 00:09:25.633
They wanna make sure
no Atreides escaped.

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:28.102
You think too much of yourself.

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:30.871
No, no,
we are in the deep desert.

00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:33.741
Only Fremen can survive here.

00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:36.110
They were here for us,
not for you.

00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:39.080
Don't worry.

00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:42.183
I'm taking you somewhere
they will never find us.

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:01.635
Filthy water.

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:05.739
It's full of chemicals, but good
enough for cooling systems.

00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:10.777
Don't let it out.

00:10:13.047 --> 00:10:15.182
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:16.383
Don't let that out.

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:18.752
Don't let it out!

00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:24.158
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:25.191
Mm-hmm.

00:10:29.797 --> 00:10:30.931
You fought well...

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:33.167
once you woke up.

00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:35.435
I wasn't sleeping.

00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:08.936
No, no, no. I'll do it.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.769
Lor... Lord Rabban.

00:12:15.803 --> 00:12:17.905
Now that the spice fields
have been secured,

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:21.175
I strongly recommend bringing
all troops out of Fremen territories.

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:23.077
We're losing too many men
to the desert.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.411
Rats.

00:12:26.113 --> 00:12:29.083
- I beg your pardon?
- We're losing men to rats.

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:34.321
Fremen!
I can't confirm, my Lord.

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:36.190
Communications are hectic
in the open sands.

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:39.093
Your orders were to control
the whole planet.

00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:43.998
- We are.
- I see only half of it.

00:12:44.031 --> 00:12:45.232
As you may recall,

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:48.102
the South is uninhabitable,
my Lord.

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.306
May I suggest you get some rest?

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:55.242
Rats! Hairy rats!

00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:57.579
Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them all!

00:12:57.612 --> 00:12:59.547
Kill them all!

00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:02.116
Rats!

00:13:48.362 --> 00:13:49.597
He's asking why we're so late.

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:56.504
He thinks you're spies.

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:01.543
- He said...
- I got that.

00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:05.112
- Thanks.
- Stay close to me. Hmm?

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:26.367
Sietch Tabr.

00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:01.663
Lisan al-Gaib!

00:17:01.589 --> 00:17:04.191
Look how your Bene Gesserit
propaganda has taken root.

00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:09.162
Some of them already think
I'm their messiah.

00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:12.165
Others...

00:17:13.735 --> 00:17:14.735
false prophet.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.373
I must sway the non-believers.

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:22.409
If they follow me, we can
disrupt spice production.

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:24.278
That's the only way
I can get to the Emperor.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.481
Your father didn't believe
in revenge.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.650
Yeah, well, I do.

00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:04.283
What is happening?

00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:14.562
What is it?

00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:16.296
There is spice in the food.

00:18:26.774 --> 00:18:28.241
Woman.

00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:32.179
Come with me.

00:19:41.783 --> 00:19:45.252
Thirty-eight million decaliters.

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:50.792
None of us, even dying of
thirst, would ever drink this water.

00:19:50.825 --> 00:19:51.859
This is...

00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:54.529
sacred.

00:19:58.666 --> 00:19:59.767
Jamis' water.

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:04.639
We have a thousand such places.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.010
When we have enough water,

00:20:09.043 --> 00:20:13.648
the Lisan al-Gaib will change
the face of Arrakis.

00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:16.316
He will bring back the trees.
He will bring back...

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:19.520
a Green Paradise.

00:20:22.657 --> 00:20:24.357
So many souls.

00:20:34.702 --> 00:20:38.438
Never give your water away,
not even for the dead. Hmm?

00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:42.744
Why are you showing me this?

00:20:42.777 --> 00:20:44.478
Because you are Bene Gesserit.

00:20:44.512 --> 00:20:48.448
Because you understand
the prophecies.

00:20:48.482 --> 00:20:51.786
The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib
will be a Reverend Mother.

00:20:53.054 --> 00:20:55.590
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.627
You want me to take her place?

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.530
Yes, I do.

00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:06.433
You believe in Paul?

00:21:09.103 --> 00:21:10.638
There are signs.

00:21:11.973 --> 00:21:13.775
Yes.

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:17.078
What if I would refuse?

00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:20.014
Mmm.
Then, he's not Lisan al-Gaib,

00:21:20.047 --> 00:21:22.083
and you have no purpose
to serve.

00:21:22.116 --> 00:21:26.087
What else is left to do then but
to return your water to the well?

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.688
Huh.

00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:32.560
It's an honor, isn't it?

00:21:34.427 --> 00:21:35.830
I think you should feel honored.

00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:37.899
Well, it was a choice
between this or death,

00:21:37.932 --> 00:21:39.767
so, you know, forgive me
if I'm not flattered.

00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:43.638
How does one become
a Reverend Mother?

00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:45.640
It's different from one culture
to another.

00:21:45.673 --> 00:21:47.575
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

00:21:51.913 --> 00:21:54.081
You're afraid.

00:21:54.115 --> 00:21:56.026
Reverend Mothers are tasked
with holding the memories

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.895
of all the Reverend Mothers
that came before them,

00:21:57.919 --> 00:22:01.088
so I'll be given centuries
of pain and sorrow.

00:22:01.923 --> 00:22:02.923
Is it dangerous?

00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:05.425
It's lethal for men.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.862
That's for sure.

00:23:16.197 --> 00:23:18.132
What are you guys
laughing about?

00:23:18.165 --> 00:23:19.399
Don't bother.

00:23:24.572 --> 00:23:25.773
You don't believe in all this?

00:23:25.806 --> 00:23:27.440
No, we don't.

00:23:27.474 --> 00:23:29.143
These are old Southern beliefs.

00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:31.444
Southern beliefs?

00:23:31.478 --> 00:23:34.782
Southern tribes believe a messiah
will come to deliver us from evil.

00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:36.884
You don't believe
in the Lisan al-Gaib?

00:23:36.918 --> 00:23:39.220
We believe in Fremen.

00:23:41.622 --> 00:23:44.725
You want to control people,
you tell them a messiah will come.

00:23:44.759 --> 00:23:48.495
- Mm-hmm.
- Then they'll wait for centuries.

00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:54.635
Now, we must pray.

00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:03.077
What about him?

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.812
- Stilgar?
- Mm-hmm.

00:24:04.845 --> 00:24:07.949
He's from the South.
You didn't notice his accent?

00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:18.259
What'll happen to my mother?

00:24:40.715 --> 00:24:43.551
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.

00:24:43.584 --> 00:24:46.554
Fear, the little death
that brings total obliteration.

00:24:46.587 --> 00:24:48.656
I will face my fear. I will...

00:25:15.282 --> 00:25:16.183
What is it?

00:25:16.217 --> 00:25:17.217
Drink!

00:27:27.915 --> 00:27:30.217
She's right. She's right!

00:27:32.386 --> 00:27:33.420
It's no miracle.

00:27:35.022 --> 00:27:37.892
My mother was trained
to do that.

00:27:37.925 --> 00:27:40.828
Poison transmutation is something
advanced Bene Gesserit can do.

00:27:44.298 --> 00:27:45.432
I'm not the Mahdi.

00:27:49.103 --> 00:27:50.304
I'm not here to lead.

00:27:56.511 --> 00:27:59.747
Let me fight beside you.
That's all I'm asking.

00:28:23.204 --> 00:28:24.204
How are you?

00:28:25.172 --> 00:28:26.173
Better.

00:28:27.274 --> 00:28:28.275
How is she?

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.412
She was frightened, but she's...

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.081
she's okay.

00:28:40.287 --> 00:28:41.287
Paul.

00:28:44.425 --> 00:28:46.126
She talks to me.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:51.165
She believes in you.

00:28:54.569 --> 00:28:55.836
She says...

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.346
You're so close now.

00:29:05.379 --> 00:29:09.383
Only one step remains and you
will become the Kwisatz Haderach.

00:29:10.484 --> 00:29:12.253
Only one step remains.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.855
You must do what I did.

00:29:14.888 --> 00:29:18.192
You must drink
the Water of Life.

00:29:18.225 --> 00:29:21.895
And your mind, it's gon... it's
gonna open and you will see.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.579
If you wanna fight with us,
first thing, you must learn

00:29:37.612 --> 00:29:39.547
to be one with the desert.

00:29:41.181 --> 00:29:44.552
So, here is a tent
and enough food.

00:29:44.586 --> 00:29:49.323
I want you to cross
that small erg and come back.

00:29:50.124 --> 00:29:51.859
Travel by night.

00:29:51.892 --> 00:29:53.360
You know how to use
a paracompass?

00:29:53.394 --> 00:29:54.394
- Yes.
- Oh.

00:29:57.532 --> 00:29:59.066
Anything else I should know?

00:29:59.099 --> 00:30:01.503
Uh, beside the worms
and the Harkonnens,

00:30:01.536 --> 00:30:05.272
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

00:30:05.306 --> 00:30:08.876
Centipedes are very nasty.
Not the big ones.

00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:10.545
They are harmless.

00:30:10.578 --> 00:30:14.248
But the little ones, you have
to worry about. And... Oh!

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.387
Don't ever,
ever listen to the jinn.

00:30:22.657 --> 00:30:24.325
- The jinn?
- Jinn.

00:30:24.358 --> 00:30:26.026
Desert spirits.

00:30:27.461 --> 00:30:30.130
They whisper at night.

00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:37.104
They, they can possess you.

00:30:37.137 --> 00:30:41.175
Really, be careful.
They are demons.

00:30:44.345 --> 00:30:46.213
But it's true.
Don't listen to them.

00:32:11.633 --> 00:32:13.167
Jamis.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.005
You sandwalk
like a drunk lizard.

00:32:21.241 --> 00:32:22.744
Yeah, I'm doing
pretty good so far.

00:32:22.777 --> 00:32:25.345
Yeah, well, you're not even
in worm territory yet.

00:32:44.364 --> 00:32:46.066
You have to break up
your rhythm.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.406
Like this.

00:32:52.439 --> 00:32:55.309
Now, that's interesting because
in the filmbooks I've studied,

00:32:55.342 --> 00:32:58.613
the anthropologists say, in order to
properly sandwalk, you actually have...

00:33:02.416 --> 00:33:04.552
Never mind. Please keep going.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.416
You know, I'm the only one who believes
you're gonna make it until summer?

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.370
Everyone else thinks
you won't make it two weeks.

00:33:39.587 --> 00:33:41.054
If you wanna follow us
in the desert,

00:33:41.088 --> 00:33:42.524
you need to know
how windtraps work.

00:33:42.557 --> 00:33:44.358
So, listen to me.

00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:46.661
They're simple, but they
require constant attention.

00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:50.163
Uh, this right here,
it captures the moisture

00:33:50.197 --> 00:33:51.757
and then it carries it
into that pocket.

00:33:52.734 --> 00:33:55.803
Uh, and these are the filters.

00:33:55.837 --> 00:33:57.505
They need to be changed
every three days.

00:33:59.406 --> 00:34:00.406
What?

00:34:05.112 --> 00:34:06.614
Stop looking at me like that.

00:34:12.152 --> 00:34:13.688
He's training with the Fremen.

00:34:13.721 --> 00:34:15.690
He will be back soon.
Don't worry.

00:34:16.824 --> 00:34:17.824
Mm-hmm.

00:34:19.259 --> 00:34:22.730
You're right. If we want
to protect your brother,

00:34:22.764 --> 00:34:25.867
we need all the Fremen
to believe in the prophecy.

00:34:30.437 --> 00:34:34.709
We must convert
the non-believers one by one.

00:34:36.844 --> 00:34:39.379
We need to start
with the weaker ones.

00:34:40.548 --> 00:34:42.282
The vulnerable ones.

00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:46.386
The ones who fear us.

00:35:09.476 --> 00:35:11.879
Hey, get out of here. Go.

00:36:54.582 --> 00:36:56.316
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:37:33.755 --> 00:37:34.889
Let's go! Move!

00:37:52.439 --> 00:37:53.674
Load.

00:38:13.694 --> 00:38:14.896
Chani!

00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:20.934
Reload!

00:38:35.583 --> 00:38:37.084
Ugh! Reload.

00:38:37.118 --> 00:38:38.385
Oh, watch out!

00:38:54.936 --> 00:38:57.104
Its shield will
only open when it fires.

00:38:57.138 --> 00:38:58.816
I know that.
What do you think I'm trying to do?

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.843
I'll trigger it.
On my signal. Be ready.

00:39:24.632 --> 00:39:25.933
Go!

00:39:27.702 --> 00:39:29.604
Ah, shit!

00:39:32.073 --> 00:39:33.941
Go! Go!

00:40:39.974 --> 00:40:41.809
Who taught you
to fight like that?

00:40:41.842 --> 00:40:43.611
- My old masters.
- Hmm.

00:40:43.644 --> 00:40:44.912
They were close friends.

00:40:48.015 --> 00:40:51.152
They were massacred.
Alongside my father.

00:40:56.724 --> 00:40:59.894
You've been fighting
the Harkonnens for decades.

00:40:59.927 --> 00:41:02.495
My family's been fighting them
for centuries.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:07.500
I know everything about them.
Their habits, their ways of thinking.

00:41:07.535 --> 00:41:08.779
You know everything
about the desert.

00:41:08.803 --> 00:41:12.506
You harness
the very power of it.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:17.278
We can stop them together, bury
them in the sand where they belong.

00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:19.780
So that this planet
can be yours once more.

00:41:19.814 --> 00:41:23.584
What would you
have us do? Huh?

00:41:23.617 --> 00:41:25.519
What would you do, Stilgar?

00:41:25.553 --> 00:41:29.623
I? I would... would
strike even further north.

00:41:29.657 --> 00:41:31.525
Then I will go further north.

00:41:31.559 --> 00:41:34.228
And the further north you go,
the more likely it is you die.

00:41:58.119 --> 00:42:01.222
I see strength in you.

00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:08.095
Come, come.

00:42:18.205 --> 00:42:23.911
You shall be know
among us as Usul.

00:42:23.944 --> 00:42:25.679
- Usul.
- Usul.

00:42:25.713 --> 00:42:29.784
Usul. And now,
a Fedaykin is a fighter

00:42:29.817 --> 00:42:31.018
and needs a war name.

00:42:31.986 --> 00:42:33.287
You must choose.

00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:39.627
How do you call the, uh...

00:42:41.062 --> 00:42:42.797
The small desert mouse, again?

00:42:44.231 --> 00:42:45.933
- Muad'Dib?
- Muad'Dib.

00:42:45.966 --> 00:42:48.602
No, no, no.

00:42:48.636 --> 00:42:52.306
Muad'Dib is wise
in the ways of the desert.

00:42:52.339 --> 00:42:53.741
Muad'Dib...

00:42:54.775 --> 00:42:57.211
creates his own water.

00:42:57.244 --> 00:43:01.115
The constellation that points to
the North Star, we call Muad'Dib.

00:43:01.148 --> 00:43:02.950
"The One Who Points the Way."

00:43:04.819 --> 00:43:06.053
That is a powerful name.

00:43:10.991 --> 00:43:15.062
Now you are our brother. Mmm.

00:43:15.096 --> 00:43:18.232
Paul Muad'Dib Usul.

00:43:24.772 --> 00:43:25.873
Muad'Dib Usul.

00:43:26.707 --> 00:43:27.775
Muad'Dib Usul.

00:43:29.777 --> 00:43:31.045
Muad'Dib Usul.

00:43:33.347 --> 00:43:35.850
Muad'Dib Usul. Mm.

00:43:36.784 --> 00:43:37.784
Muad'Dib.

00:43:40.921 --> 00:43:41.921
Usul.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.042
Hey! Stilgar!

00:44:16.924 --> 00:44:18.325
Father, I found my way.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:36.677
It's breathtaking.

00:44:45.419 --> 00:44:46.687
Hmm.

00:44:48.255 --> 00:44:52.359
Look. Right there. Spice.

00:44:52.393 --> 00:44:55.229
Arrakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

00:45:02.903 --> 00:45:07.408
Where you're from, does water
really fall from the sky?

00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:09.743
Oh, hm, yes.

00:45:09.777 --> 00:45:12.947
Sometimes it rains
for weeks on Caladan.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.249
Where you see sand here,
imagine water.

00:45:18.419 --> 00:45:22.524
Our castle stands on cliffs
high above the sea.

00:45:22.557 --> 00:45:25.492
If you dive in,
you can't reach the bottom.

00:45:25.527 --> 00:45:29.496
- You dive in?
- Yes, it's called swimming.

00:45:29.531 --> 00:45:32.333
I don't...
I don't believe you, Usul.

00:45:32.366 --> 00:45:33.434
Usul.

00:45:36.136 --> 00:45:37.371
What's your secret name?

00:45:39.807 --> 00:45:41.442
Sihaya.

00:45:41.475 --> 00:45:42.843
- Sihaya.
- Hmm.

00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:46.046
What does that mean?

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.915
Means Desert Spring.

00:45:47.948 --> 00:45:49.016
"Desert Spring."

00:45:50.951 --> 00:45:52.419
- I love it.
- I hate it.

00:45:53.588 --> 00:45:55.456
It's from some stupid prophecy.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.525
I prefer Chani.

00:45:58.593 --> 00:46:00.127
I prefer Chani, too, then.

00:46:07.234 --> 00:46:09.169
Do you think Stilgar
would teach me?

00:46:09.203 --> 00:46:10.904
- To ride?
- Yeah.

00:46:10.938 --> 00:46:14.174
No. Only Fremen ride worms.

00:46:14.208 --> 00:46:15.976
Well, I thought I'd become one,
didn't I?

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.878
By name, not by blood.

00:46:20.214 --> 00:46:24.918
Your blood comes
from Dukes and Great Houses.

00:46:26.954 --> 00:46:29.256
We don't have that here.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:33.294
Here, we're equal,
men and women alike.

00:46:33.327 --> 00:46:35.496
What we do,
we do for the benefit of all.

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.898
Well, I'd very much like
to be equal to you.

00:46:44.138 --> 00:46:47.374
Paul Muad'Dib Usul...

00:46:49.276 --> 00:46:51.445
maybe you could be Fremen.

00:46:54.649 --> 00:46:56.050
Maybe I'll show you the way.

00:48:25.105 --> 00:48:26.407
Rabban.

00:48:37.284 --> 00:48:41.656
Fremen attacks on your watch.

00:48:41.689 --> 00:48:47.662
Your orders were to restore
spice production to full capacity.

00:48:47.695 --> 00:48:50.130
Do you know
what it means if you fail?

00:48:51.733 --> 00:48:55.637
The Emperor will take spice
out of our control.

00:48:56.638 --> 00:48:58.272
Tighten your grip, Rabban.

00:48:58.305 --> 00:49:00.340
Uncle.

00:49:00.374 --> 00:49:02.677
Or feel mine on your neck.

00:49:18.392 --> 00:49:20.528
Usul? Usul.

00:49:20.562 --> 00:49:23.363
It's okay. It's okay.

00:49:26.668 --> 00:49:27.668
Hey.

00:49:30.471 --> 00:49:33.575
I'm here, I'm here.

00:49:33.608 --> 00:49:36.678
It's been a while since you've
had one of those nightmares.

00:49:36.711 --> 00:49:37.711
Mm.

00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:43.685
Tell me, what was it about?

00:49:49.757 --> 00:49:53.060
Nothing's clear.
It's only fragments.

00:49:55.095 --> 00:49:59.032
I'm in the South,
and I'm following someone.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.336
And it triggers a holy war.

00:50:05.807 --> 00:50:09.511
Millions and millions of people
starving to death...

00:50:10.845 --> 00:50:12.212
because of me.

00:50:18.118 --> 00:50:21.255
You've been exposed
to spice for a long time.

00:50:21.288 --> 00:50:23.357
It can create weird dreams.

00:50:30.397 --> 00:50:31.397
It's a big day.

00:50:33.433 --> 00:50:35.068
We can ask Stilgar
to call it off.

00:50:35.102 --> 00:50:37.572
No. I'm fine.

00:50:53.621 --> 00:50:54.621
Usul.

00:50:57.391 --> 00:50:59.326
I tuned it myself.

00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:02.697
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:51:05.499 --> 00:51:09.336
Don't try to impress anyone.
You are brave. We all know that.

00:51:10.304 --> 00:51:12.674
Heh? Be simple.

00:51:12.707 --> 00:51:16.109
Be direct. Nothing fancy.

00:51:16.143 --> 00:51:18.278
- Nothing fancy.
- Hey, I'm serious.

00:51:18.312 --> 00:51:20.782
Nothing fancy or you will shame
my teaching.

00:51:20.815 --> 00:51:24.852
I won't shame you.
I understand.

00:51:24.886 --> 00:51:29.524
Shai-Hulud decides today if
you become Fremen, or if you die.

00:51:37.565 --> 00:51:38.666
Hey, Muad'Dib!

00:52:20.508 --> 00:52:21.509
Lower.

00:52:45.833 --> 00:52:48.235
Okay. Okay.

00:53:59.907 --> 00:54:04.444
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:54:52.026 --> 00:54:53.060
Okay.

00:55:10.678 --> 00:55:12.013
Okay. Okay!

00:55:36.904 --> 00:55:37.939
Come on!

00:55:48.883 --> 00:55:49.883
Whoa!

00:56:53.214 --> 00:56:54.515
You're a rider!

00:58:50.064 --> 00:58:52.600
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
I know they do.

00:58:55.336 --> 00:58:58.005
Our task in the North
is nearly done.

00:58:58.039 --> 00:58:59.774
They believe in Paul.

00:59:00.808 --> 00:59:03.044
Now we go South.

00:59:03.077 --> 00:59:06.747
There are millions
of fundamentalists there.

00:59:06.781 --> 00:59:09.116
They will protect him
when he comes.

00:59:11.786 --> 00:59:15.956
The Kwisatz Haderach
will be born in the South.

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:31.739
As long as I breathe.

00:59:36.177 --> 00:59:37.177
What's wrong?

00:59:43.217 --> 00:59:44.185
Chani.

00:59:44.218 --> 00:59:45.786
There will be trouble.

00:59:47.955 --> 00:59:49.223
What are you talking about?

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.662
Chani, what do you mean?

00:59:54.695 --> 00:59:56.030
The way they look at you.

00:59:57.398 --> 00:59:58.866
They worship you now.

01:00:01.769 --> 01:00:04.238
The Fedaykin,
they count your victories.

01:00:04.271 --> 01:00:06.874
They say you can see the future.

01:00:06.907 --> 01:00:08.676
Whisper, " Lisan al-Gaib."

01:00:09.944 --> 01:00:11.278
I'm no messiah.

01:00:14.048 --> 01:00:17.218
I'm a Fedaykin of Sietch Tabr.

01:00:17.251 --> 01:00:19.954
Yet, we have a Bene Gesserit
among us,

01:00:19.987 --> 01:00:21.322
fanning the flames
of your legend,

01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:22.890
saying you're the One.

01:00:44.345 --> 01:00:45.880
Mm.

01:00:50.317 --> 01:00:52.153
She says you should
be coming with us.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.088
You know I can't.

01:00:54.989 --> 01:00:56.423
She's asking why.

01:00:56.457 --> 01:00:58.425
Because I must continue
fighting in the North,

01:00:58.459 --> 01:01:00.661
to protect you down
there in the South.

01:01:02.429 --> 01:01:06.066
She says she can tell
when you lie.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.403
Tell her that's because our mother
keeps spreading dangerous tales.

01:01:17.011 --> 01:01:18.812
What is she saying now?

01:01:18.846 --> 01:01:21.248
She says you're blinded by love,

01:01:21.282 --> 01:01:23.450
and she reminds you that
you must reserve your hand

01:01:23.484 --> 01:01:25.319
for the most strategic alliance.

01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:31.325
She's also wondering why
you don't believe in who you are.

01:01:31.358 --> 01:01:32.726
I do believe.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.695
I believe I matter
to these people.

01:01:36.297 --> 01:01:38.299
And I believe I'm making
a difference in this war.

01:01:40.334 --> 01:01:42.069
We're nearly
at the gates of the city.

01:01:42.102 --> 01:01:44.972
- That's not what she means.
- I know what she means.

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.341
Do you not think I also feel
the weight of the prophecy?

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.343
It's not a prophecy.

01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:51.078
It's a story that you
keep telling,

01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:53.147
but it's not their story,
it's yours.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.383
They deserve to be led
by one of their own.

01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:59.119
What your people did
to this world is heartbreaking.

01:01:59.153 --> 01:02:00.821
We gave them something
to hope for.

01:02:00.854 --> 01:02:02.356
That's not hope!

01:02:16.538 --> 01:02:18.038
I'll be waiting for you.

01:02:19.473 --> 01:02:20.908
All of us.

01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:22.910
All of us.

01:03:04.285 --> 01:03:06.920
Those storms look bad.

01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:55.637
- How much?
- We lost...

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:58.339
eighty percent of our last crop.

01:03:58.372 --> 01:04:02.242
My Lord Rabban, you should
not leave the security perimeter.

01:04:02.276 --> 01:04:04.878
Security perimeter?
The rats are already inside.

01:04:04.912 --> 01:04:06.548
The Fremen Demon
might be with them.

01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.282
I hope so.

01:04:08.315 --> 01:04:09.475
We're tracking them, my Lord.

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.953
Today, Muad'Dib dies!

01:04:54.529 --> 01:04:56.196
Where is he?

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:57.665
Still negative, my Lord.

01:04:57.699 --> 01:04:59.266
Why do I have to do
everything myself?

01:05:02.403 --> 01:05:03.470
Open range!

01:05:03.505 --> 01:05:05.005
Range open.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:14.516
Life. Delta, delta, delta.

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.037
I've lost them.

01:05:42.443 --> 01:05:44.278
- Strike!
- Yes, my Lord.

01:06:50.845 --> 01:06:53.681
Muad'Dib!

01:06:53.715 --> 01:06:55.583
Show yourself!

01:07:26.446 --> 01:07:30.518
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:25.707
For Muad'Dib!

01:08:38.352 --> 01:08:39.386
Muad'Dib.

01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:45.760
Some new Fremen prophet?

01:08:45.793 --> 01:08:48.696
It's not the first time we've
had frictions with the Fremen.

01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:50.531
None of this magnitude.

01:08:54.736 --> 01:08:56.336
So, my dear daughter...

01:08:57.605 --> 01:08:59.807
how would you deal
with this prophet?

01:09:06.213 --> 01:09:08.883
If this Muad'Dib
is a religious figure,

01:09:10.618 --> 01:09:12.386
you can't use direct force.

01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:17.324
Repression only makes
a religion flourish.

01:09:17.357 --> 01:09:19.426
You'll only end up
humiliating yourself.

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:21.194
You underestimate my Sardaukar.

01:09:21.228 --> 01:09:23.898
You underestimate
the power of faith.

01:09:27.802 --> 01:09:31.371
Her Highness proves once again
that she was my most acute student.

01:09:33.641 --> 01:09:36.511
- You'd send assassins?
- No.

01:09:36.544 --> 01:09:38.311
Prophets get stronger
when they die.

01:09:39.981 --> 01:09:42.583
Let the conflict
on Arrakis turn into war.

01:09:42.617 --> 01:09:45.787
You then bring peace.
As a savior.

01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:50.257
You'd be a formidable empress.

01:09:54.595 --> 01:09:57.532
Muad'Dib. The prophet.

01:09:57.565 --> 01:10:00.233
The one who points the way.

01:10:00.267 --> 01:10:02.436
These are our own
religious patterns, aren't they?

01:10:02.469 --> 01:10:03.738
This is our doing.

01:10:07.407 --> 01:10:10.444
Muad'Dib means kangaroo mouse.

01:10:10.477 --> 01:10:12.379
An unusual war name
for a Fremen.

01:10:14.582 --> 01:10:17.685
- What if Paul Atreides were still alive?
- -Enough!

01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:21.856
This must not come out. Even
to your father's ears. Understand?

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:25.727
I do, Reverend Mother.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.996
If Paul is alive,
he likely knows the truth.

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.965
And should
the Great Houses learn

01:10:30.998 --> 01:10:34.334
that your father was behind
the liquidation of the Atreides,

01:10:34.367 --> 01:10:37.705
your father will face war
and lose the throne.

01:10:39.674 --> 01:10:41.008
Then what hope is there?

01:10:42.543 --> 01:10:43.543
Hope?

01:10:44.879 --> 01:10:49.016
We are Bene Gesserit.
We don't hope, we plan.

01:10:50.383 --> 01:10:54.354
Paul is not our only prospect.

01:10:54.387 --> 01:10:59.392
The Baron's youngest nephew, Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen, will inherit Arrakis.

01:11:00.928 --> 01:11:02.462
He may be the answer.

01:11:02.496 --> 01:11:05.032
Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic.

01:11:05.066 --> 01:11:07.001
That's irrelevant.

01:11:07.034 --> 01:11:11.371
The question is,
can we control him?

01:11:11.404 --> 01:11:12.807
And I intend to find out.

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:38.699
Would you like some fresh meat,
my darlings?

01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:42.870
Lungs? Or liver?

01:11:42.904 --> 01:11:45.973
What would you like?
I hear they're big today.

01:11:46.007 --> 01:11:50.477
Your new blades
for this very special day,

01:11:50.511 --> 01:11:53.346
na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:23.711
A notch off balance.

01:12:23.744 --> 01:12:24.744
It's the tip.

01:12:25.546 --> 01:12:26.981
Should be sharper.

01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:42.797
Come.

01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:44.866
I won't die like a fool.

01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:46.033
Kill me now.

01:12:46.067 --> 01:12:48.836
No drug for you today, Atreides.

01:14:04.178 --> 01:14:06.213
Welcome to Giedi Prime, sisters.

01:14:06.247 --> 01:14:08.516
I hope your travels
were agreeable.

01:14:08.549 --> 01:14:10.785
A long way to come
just to watch our prospect

01:14:10.818 --> 01:14:12.753
risk his life, Lady Fenring.

01:14:12.787 --> 01:14:14.822
No fear.

01:14:14.855 --> 01:14:16.557
These fights are all for show.

01:14:18.025 --> 01:14:20.628
But we'll get
a good look at him.

01:14:42.683 --> 01:14:46.587
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

01:16:00.961 --> 01:16:01.961
That slave isn't drugged.

01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:04.765
That bug is walking straight.

01:16:06.033 --> 01:16:07.268
You should cancel the fight.

01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:10.137
Don't spoil
my nephew's birthday.

01:16:57.751 --> 01:17:00.654
Happy birthday, dear nephew.

01:17:17.071 --> 01:17:19.039
Why do they not stop the fight?

01:17:19.073 --> 01:17:20.941
Plans within plans.

01:17:25.746 --> 01:17:27.148
Show me who you are.

01:17:44.131 --> 01:17:45.699
There he is.

01:18:30.277 --> 01:18:32.079
Back! Back!

01:18:49.930 --> 01:18:51.165
Stay back!

01:19:04.945 --> 01:19:07.181
You have fought well, Atreides.

01:19:08.282 --> 01:19:09.551
Hmm.

01:19:18.959 --> 01:19:23.297
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

01:19:28.936 --> 01:19:30.304
He's impressive, indeed.

01:19:30.337 --> 01:19:34.208
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

01:19:42.182 --> 01:19:43.817
The slave wasn't drugged.

01:19:46.186 --> 01:19:48.822
You tried to kill me.

01:19:48.856 --> 01:19:51.225
This morning you were a playboy,

01:19:51.258 --> 01:19:53.160
feared and envied,

01:19:53.193 --> 01:19:56.497
but tonight you're a hero.

01:19:56.531 --> 01:19:58.265
My gift to you.

01:19:58.299 --> 01:20:00.301
I ought to drown you
in that tub.

01:20:01.869 --> 01:20:04.071
Don't be hasty.

01:20:04.104 --> 01:20:06.541
I have another gift for you.

01:20:06.574 --> 01:20:07.941
A bigger one.

01:20:09.443 --> 01:20:11.211
Arrakis.

01:20:14.982 --> 01:20:16.850
What about Rabban?

01:20:16.884 --> 01:20:19.153
He has failed
to protect spice production.

01:20:19.186 --> 01:20:21.355
Rabban will be reassigned.

01:20:25.326 --> 01:20:28.228
Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

01:20:28.262 --> 01:20:30.864
Free the spice.
I'll make you Emperor.

01:20:43.177 --> 01:20:45.012
Emperor?

01:20:48.215 --> 01:20:49.215
How?

01:20:51.318 --> 01:20:54.254
The Emperor helped me
destroy the Atreides.

01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:58.359
He lent his own army
to the cause.

01:20:58.392 --> 01:21:00.928
A serious crime.

01:21:00.961 --> 01:21:05.165
If it came to light, the Great
Houses would rise against him.

01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:07.201
And then...

01:21:08.469 --> 01:21:10.904
who will sit on the throne?

01:21:11.673 --> 01:21:14.908
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

01:21:55.149 --> 01:21:56.283
You're following me.

01:21:57.652 --> 01:21:58.686
Am I?

01:22:00.655 --> 01:22:02.189
I may have gotten lost.

01:22:04.358 --> 01:22:09.062
Will you show me the way out
of this maze, my Lord na-Baron?

01:22:16.303 --> 01:22:18.472
We've met, haven't we?

01:22:21.743 --> 01:22:23.043
I don't think so.

01:22:24.011 --> 01:22:26.413
I'm Lady Margot Fenring.

01:22:26.447 --> 01:22:28.750
I'm here to honor
your coming of age.

01:22:28.783 --> 01:22:30.552
You're not allowed
in this section.

01:22:31.686 --> 01:22:33.287
How did you get past the guards?

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.522
The guards?

01:22:37.491 --> 01:22:39.393
May I ask,
what are you doing here?

01:22:41.663 --> 01:22:45.098
You're not taking part
in your own celebrations?

01:22:55.442 --> 01:22:58.278
You're Bene Gesserit.

01:22:58.312 --> 01:23:01.181
And what makes you say that?

01:23:01.215 --> 01:23:03.685
I remember now.

01:23:03.718 --> 01:23:06.420
I dreamed about you last night.

01:23:06.453 --> 01:23:08.155
A pleasant dream, I hope.

01:23:08.188 --> 01:23:09.691
Don't mock me, woman.

01:23:09.724 --> 01:23:11.058
I wouldn't dare.

01:23:13.393 --> 01:23:16.396
I know your
Bene Gesserit tricks.

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:18.700
And what do you know
about the Bene Gesserit?

01:23:22.604 --> 01:23:23.604
Tell me.

01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:29.309
Something wrong?

01:23:29.343 --> 01:23:30.645
I don't recognize this place.

01:23:31.846 --> 01:23:33.515
This is the guest wing.

01:23:36.383 --> 01:23:37.484
Where are you going?

01:23:39.386 --> 01:23:40.386
To my room.

01:24:07.582 --> 01:24:13.053
Come. To. Me.

01:24:16.356 --> 01:24:17.457
Kneel.

01:24:31.606 --> 01:24:34.474
Put your right hand in the box.

01:24:49.691 --> 01:24:53.126
A sociopath.
Of high intelligence.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:55.162
Driven. Cruel.

01:24:55.195 --> 01:24:57.264
But strongly motivated by honor.

01:24:58.398 --> 01:25:00.535
He yearns to be hurt.

01:25:00.568 --> 01:25:02.502
He loves pain.

01:25:02.537 --> 01:25:04.137
Can he be redeemed?

01:25:04.171 --> 01:25:05.640
He can be controlled.

01:25:05.673 --> 01:25:07.441
He's sexually vulnerable.

01:25:09.611 --> 01:25:10.611
And?

01:25:11.946 --> 01:25:13.615
The bloodline is secured.

01:25:15.382 --> 01:25:18.218
Female, as you requested.

01:25:19.252 --> 01:25:21.589
You did well, Margot.

01:25:21.623 --> 01:25:24.826
Respectfully, why didn't you
test him yourself?

01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:28.730
I'm a motherly figure.

01:25:28.763 --> 01:25:32.366
And based on what happened
between him and his own mother,

01:25:32.399 --> 01:25:34.936
I didn't expect to be effective.

01:25:34.969 --> 01:25:36.571
What happened between
him and his mother?

01:25:37.371 --> 01:25:38.371
He murdered her.

01:25:39.674 --> 01:25:42.644
Desire and humiliation.

01:25:43.911 --> 01:25:46.514
Those are his levers.

01:25:46.547 --> 01:25:48.916
If Feyd-Rautha
prevails on Arrakis,

01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:51.653
we shall know
how to control him.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.842
Rid me of this Fremen Demon.

01:26:29.891 --> 01:26:33.493
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

01:26:33.528 --> 01:26:37.832
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:39.534
Feyd-Rautha!

Juicy?

01:27:28.883 --> 01:27:30.718
Juicy, juicy.

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.022
Well, it was nice knowing ya.

01:27:35.056 --> 01:27:36.557
Oh, yeah?

01:27:36.591 --> 01:27:38.325
Radar's clear. We're clear.

01:27:39.727 --> 01:27:41.229
Cooking time.

01:28:01.048 --> 01:28:02.817
Juicy, juicy.

01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:04.819
Yeah, I got a meter reading...

01:28:04.852 --> 01:28:06.854
All right, guys,
worms are on their way.

01:28:06.888 --> 01:28:07.965
- Watch out for abrasions.
- -Get ready to dock.

01:28:07.989 --> 01:28:09.356
It's gonna get hot.

01:28:13.493 --> 01:28:15.428
Crank 'em up!
Throw them up!

01:28:44.158 --> 01:28:45.158
Hold!

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.008
Mine! Mine!

01:29:01.042 --> 01:29:02.777
Get moving!

01:29:06.814 --> 01:29:09.050
- East! East!
- Get clear!

01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:17.625
Let's get out of here!

01:29:17.658 --> 01:29:19.026
Incoming!

01:29:22.462 --> 01:29:24.098
Don't run, fight!

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:27.869
We're in deep Fremen shit.

01:29:29.937 --> 01:29:31.438
Holy Mother.

01:29:42.617 --> 01:29:43.751
Oh, fuck.

01:30:00.735 --> 01:30:03.571
I recognized your footsteps...

01:30:03.604 --> 01:30:05.172
- old man.
- No.

01:30:29.563 --> 01:30:31.666
You young pup.

01:30:32.233 --> 01:30:34.101
You young pup!

01:30:41.175 --> 01:30:43.911
Mmm.
After the Battle of Arrakeen,

01:30:43.945 --> 01:30:47.447
I was able to negotiate a trip
back home for the survivors.

01:30:48.683 --> 01:30:50.718
Thanks to these guys.

01:30:50.751 --> 01:30:51.953
Why'd you stay?

01:30:52.987 --> 01:30:54.454
Well, I wanted blood.

01:30:56.657 --> 01:30:57.758
Rabban's head?

01:30:58.893 --> 01:31:00.861
Mm-hmm.

01:31:00.895 --> 01:31:03.998
Well, since Muad'Dib's
been driving Rabban crazy,

01:31:04.031 --> 01:31:08.903
the smuggling business
has been quite profitable.

01:31:08.936 --> 01:31:10.738
Gurney Halleck the smuggler.

01:31:12.907 --> 01:31:15.242
Paul Muad'Dib.

01:31:15.276 --> 01:31:17.979
I've heard many stories
about Muad'Dib.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:20.648
None of them pretty.

01:31:21.882 --> 01:31:23.184
You see the fear?

01:31:24.986 --> 01:31:26.821
When our resources
are limited...

01:31:29.623 --> 01:31:31.125
fear is all we have.

01:31:48.843 --> 01:31:50.311
How many men with you?

01:31:50.344 --> 01:31:52.546
- Two hundred.
- Two hundred?

01:31:57.118 --> 01:32:00.054
Do you realize what you're able
to achieve with 200 men?

01:32:01.355 --> 01:32:03.090
Incredible fighters.

01:32:03.124 --> 01:32:04.668
Duncan said there
were millions of them.

01:32:04.692 --> 01:32:06.293
In the Deep South, yes.

01:32:06.327 --> 01:32:08.763
Well, what are you waiting for?

01:32:08.796 --> 01:32:11.999
With thousands of these guys, you
could take control of the entire planet.

01:32:12.033 --> 01:32:14.068
It's your father's dream.
What are you afraid of?

01:32:14.101 --> 01:32:15.102
Hey!

01:32:17.204 --> 01:32:18.906
Worship, Gurney.

01:32:20.207 --> 01:32:21.542
They used to be friends.

01:32:23.177 --> 01:32:24.612
Now they're followers.

01:32:24.645 --> 01:32:26.714
Muad'Dib, the Prophet.

01:32:26.747 --> 01:32:28.682
Why is that a bad thing?
Use it.

01:32:28.716 --> 01:32:30.851
It's not that simple.

01:32:30.885 --> 01:32:33.687
You have the power to avenge
your father, and you're afraid to use it?

01:32:33.721 --> 01:32:35.723
Spice opened my mind, Gurney.

01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:38.025
I can foresee things.

01:32:40.027 --> 01:32:43.964
If I go South, all my visions
lead to horror.

01:32:43.998 --> 01:32:47.301
Billions of corpses
scattered across the galaxy.

01:32:47.334 --> 01:32:48.836
All dying because of me.

01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:51.005
Because you lose control.

01:32:53.074 --> 01:32:54.141
Because I gain it.

01:33:13.027 --> 01:33:14.195
That's a lot of water.

01:33:16.964 --> 01:33:18.299
Chani.

01:33:18.332 --> 01:33:20.034
What?
Look at him, he's hopeless.

01:33:20.901 --> 01:33:21.901
He's family.

01:33:25.306 --> 01:33:26.307
Really?

01:33:54.368 --> 01:33:56.871
No need to be a prophet
to see what's ahead.

01:33:59.807 --> 01:34:01.142
Your path leads to war.

01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:03.978
You know that.

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.749
So, war is coming.

01:34:08.782 --> 01:34:12.353
What will you do when you feel
its breath upon your neck?

01:34:16.090 --> 01:34:18.359
If you don't want to raise
an army in the South,

01:34:18.392 --> 01:34:20.027
you may still have an option.

01:34:23.364 --> 01:34:24.398
Fire power...

01:34:26.133 --> 01:34:27.801
which you don't have.

01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:30.970
And here I am.

01:34:35.409 --> 01:34:37.945
I know where your father
hid the family atomics.

01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:46.153
Every House possesses
an atomic arsenal.

01:34:47.522 --> 01:34:49.456
I thought ours had been lost.

01:34:51.926 --> 01:34:54.295
It's huge, Chani.
It could change everything.

01:34:59.767 --> 01:35:02.937
I could aim the bombs
at the main spice fields.

01:35:04.905 --> 01:35:08.108
He who can destroy a thing
has the real control of it.

01:35:09.843 --> 01:35:11.278
So, you can control it
and not us?

01:35:13.548 --> 01:35:15.349
You promised me
you didn't want power.

01:35:17.251 --> 01:35:19.253
No matter what I do,
you still don't trust me.

01:35:19.286 --> 01:35:22.056
'Cause you're a foreigner.
Like your friend.

01:35:24.391 --> 01:35:25.993
I'm not a foreigner.

01:35:33.801 --> 01:35:35.069
Not to me.

01:35:35.102 --> 01:35:36.770
But to the desert, you are.

01:35:37.871 --> 01:35:39.873
My allegiance is to you.

01:35:40.542 --> 01:35:41.942
To the Fremen.

01:35:41.976 --> 01:35:43.777
I'm doing this for all of us.

01:35:45.246 --> 01:35:46.246
Do you believe me?

01:35:54.855 --> 01:35:55.923
I'll talk to Stilgar.

01:36:04.031 --> 01:36:05.032
There.

01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:12.473
It's right under
everybody's noses.

01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:15.209
Not clever.

01:36:15.242 --> 01:36:17.011
That's the idea.

01:36:17.044 --> 01:36:19.246
Nobody would ever look in there
because it's obvious.

01:36:21.915 --> 01:36:23.884
Not clever.

01:36:23.917 --> 01:36:25.386
Did you find it?

01:36:25.419 --> 01:36:27.589
I didn't look for it.

01:36:27.622 --> 01:36:29.089
How many heads exactly?

01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:32.893
Enough to blow up
the whole planet.

01:36:35.963 --> 01:36:37.331
It's a figure of speech.

01:36:39.233 --> 01:36:40.267
You know what I mean.

01:37:03.023 --> 01:37:04.958
Only with your genetic heritage.

01:37:44.632 --> 01:37:48.335
Your great-great-grandfather's
legacy.

01:37:48.369 --> 01:37:52.072
The 92 original Atreides
family's atomic warheads.

01:37:55.008 --> 01:37:58.178
Now that, that is power.

01:38:05.052 --> 01:38:09.256
Imperial Diary. Year 10,191.

01:38:09.289 --> 01:38:11.559
Eighth comment.

01:38:11.593 --> 01:38:15.462
Reports from the south
of Arrakis arrive rarely.

01:38:15.496 --> 01:38:19.199
These are barren, burnt lands
hidden by sandstorms

01:38:19.233 --> 01:38:21.502
which stretch a thousand miles
across the equator.

01:38:23.504 --> 01:38:27.441
Nothing can live there
without faith.

01:38:27.474 --> 01:38:31.546
Which is why our Bene Gesserit
missionaries have been so productive there.

01:38:35.082 --> 01:38:38.051
Through them, we are receiving
reports of a mysterious figure

01:38:38.085 --> 01:38:39.953
taking grip on the imaginations

01:38:39.987 --> 01:38:43.357
of the Southern
fundamentalist tribes.

01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:47.027
A new Reverend Mother
from the North...

01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:51.165
spreading word of the imminent
arrival of the Lisan al-Gaib,

01:38:51.198 --> 01:38:54.268
"The Voice
from the Outer World."

01:38:54.301 --> 01:38:57.572
With religious fervor
rising in the South,

01:38:57.605 --> 01:39:01.408
and Muad'Dib strangling
spice production in the North,

01:39:01.442 --> 01:39:04.945
everything points
to the escalation of war.

01:39:24.699 --> 01:39:25.699
Hmm.

01:39:35.342 --> 01:39:36.342
Quiet.

01:41:25.252 --> 01:41:26.854
Listen carefully.

01:41:26.888 --> 01:41:28.590
Soon a man
is going to visit your temple

01:41:28.623 --> 01:41:31.358
and he may want
you to perform the rites.

01:41:31.391 --> 01:41:34.328
Reverend Mother,
it is forbidden.

01:41:39.667 --> 01:41:41.501
Let him try!

01:42:25.613 --> 01:42:26.781
What the hell?

01:42:30.384 --> 01:42:31.619
Chani!

01:42:37.592 --> 01:42:38.893
Chani!

01:42:42.964 --> 01:42:44.231
Chani.

01:42:53.908 --> 01:42:55.610
Sietch Tabr.

01:43:19.901 --> 01:43:21.602
Old fashioned artillery.

01:43:22.737 --> 01:43:24.672
Genius.

01:43:24.706 --> 01:43:27.542
We're literally melting rock
on their heads.

01:43:27.575 --> 01:43:30.611
I want to go on the ground.
Prepare my troops.

01:43:30.645 --> 01:43:33.815
My Lord. I would recommend
you stay inside. There was...

01:43:33.848 --> 01:43:35.783
Bring his body to my quarters.

01:43:36.951 --> 01:43:39.286
My poor darlings are hungry.

01:43:39.319 --> 01:43:40.988
There was no food
for them on the flight.

01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:45.026
What are you doing here?

01:43:45.059 --> 01:43:48.295
It's early morning.
What are you doing here?

01:43:48.328 --> 01:43:49.997
Kiss my feet, brother.

01:43:50.031 --> 01:43:51.298
I'm gonna eviscerate your...

01:43:57.304 --> 01:43:59.774
You humiliated our family.

01:44:00.908 --> 01:44:02.677
You humiliated me.

01:44:03.678 --> 01:44:05.046
Kiss...

01:44:05.079 --> 01:44:06.881
or die.

01:44:17.357 --> 01:44:18.458
We're even now.

01:44:24.632 --> 01:44:27.267
Embarrass our family
one more time...

01:44:28.536 --> 01:44:29.704
it will be the last.

01:45:04.672 --> 01:45:07.108
They didn't even
engage on the ground,

01:45:07.141 --> 01:45:09.510
like honorable fighters.

01:45:41.843 --> 01:45:44.879
Usul, in the South...

01:45:44.912 --> 01:45:47.414
only leaders
are allowed to speak.

01:45:48.716 --> 01:45:51.586
- You must take my place.
- I can't do that.

01:45:51.619 --> 01:45:54.522
It is a good time
to cross blades with me.

01:45:54.555 --> 01:45:57.859
I am weak.
I am an easy kill, Muad'Dib.

01:45:57.892 --> 01:45:59.861
I'd rather cut off my own hand.

01:45:59.894 --> 01:46:02.630
We need you. We need the
Lisan al-Gaib to lead our people.

01:46:02.663 --> 01:46:04.599
You know what I think
of all that, Stilgar.

01:46:04.632 --> 01:46:07.034
I don't care what you believe.
I believe.

01:46:21.616 --> 01:46:22.884
I didn't see it coming.

01:46:24.785 --> 01:46:26.520
The Harkonnens aren't done here.

01:46:27.622 --> 01:46:29.757
They just went back to reload.

01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:31.659
We're setting thumpers.

01:46:31.692 --> 01:46:33.036
We're moving everyone
to the South.

01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:34.962
I'll stay behind
and cover your retreat.

01:46:34.996 --> 01:46:37.430
- What are you talking about?
- Chani, I can't go with you.

01:46:38.099 --> 01:46:39.700
You know why.

01:46:39.734 --> 01:46:41.736
- I'll stay, too.
- Nobody stays but me.

01:46:41.769 --> 01:46:44.205
- Paul.
- That's an order, Gurney Halleck! Go South!

01:46:44.238 --> 01:46:45.606
Protect my mother.

01:46:48.042 --> 01:46:49.176
- My Lord.
- Muad'Dib.

01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:01.055
He's afraid
of the fundamentalists.

01:47:02.590 --> 01:47:03.591
And he should be.

01:47:17.038 --> 01:47:18.438
Don't resist.

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.148
Talk to me, Jamis.

01:47:38.025 --> 01:47:42.196
You see only fragments.

01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:46.167
You cannot see the future
without seeing the past.

01:47:48.536 --> 01:47:52.974
To unlock your mind, you
need to drink the Water of Life...

01:47:53.007 --> 01:47:55.943
and you will see everything.

01:47:59.647 --> 01:48:03.050
A good hunter always climbs
the highest dune before his hunt.

01:48:04.652 --> 01:48:05.820
He needs to see...

01:48:07.788 --> 01:48:09.256
as far as he can see.

01:48:14.662 --> 01:48:15.796
You need to see.

01:48:18.666 --> 01:48:20.701
You must drink
the Water of Life.

01:48:22.003 --> 01:48:23.704
Your mind, it's gonna open,

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:27.641
and you will see.

01:48:46.027 --> 01:48:47.962
The world has made
choices for us.

01:48:53.067 --> 01:48:54.835
If I go South, I might lose you.

01:48:54.869 --> 01:48:56.637
You will never lose me,

01:48:57.938 --> 01:48:59.106
Paul Atreides.

01:49:01.008 --> 01:49:03.310
Not as long
as you stay who you are.

01:49:10.918 --> 01:49:12.920
I'll cross the storms with you.

01:49:12.953 --> 01:49:14.221
Go South.

01:49:15.623 --> 01:49:17.091
Bring your people to safety.

01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:25.933
And then I will do
what must be done.

01:49:50.091 --> 01:49:51.258
Where?

01:49:51.292 --> 01:49:53.861
Spy. Left behind.

01:49:53.894 --> 01:49:55.796
No trace of the others.

01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:58.299
They've gone South
to hide in the storms.

01:50:03.137 --> 01:50:04.872
Send this message to the Baron.

01:50:04.905 --> 01:50:07.208
The North is liberated
and secured.

01:50:07.241 --> 01:50:09.777
Harvest spice at will.

01:50:09.810 --> 01:50:11.145
Yes, na-Baron.

01:50:25.893 --> 01:50:29.263
You killed nine of my men
with one single blade.

01:50:30.831 --> 01:50:32.666
She won't talk.

01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:34.668
Tell her that's fine.

01:50:34.702 --> 01:50:36.937
I already know
everything I need to know.

01:50:44.945 --> 01:50:46.780
Only pleasure remains.

01:52:52.139 --> 01:52:56.043
Now that you can see our past,

01:52:59.313 --> 01:53:02.383
you can see your future.

01:53:23.404 --> 01:53:27.274
Oh, brother, my dearest brother,

01:53:27.308 --> 01:53:30.110
you are not prepared
for what is to come.

01:53:31.945 --> 01:53:35.249
You'll now learn the truth
about our family.

01:53:35.282 --> 01:53:38.852
And it will hurt you
to the core.

01:53:40.387 --> 01:53:42.356
Paul...

01:53:42.389 --> 01:53:45.459
Don't worry. I'm with you.

01:53:46.994 --> 01:53:48.362
I love you.

01:54:01.509 --> 01:54:02.910
Find them.

01:54:32.339 --> 01:54:33.340
Paul?

01:54:34.108 --> 01:54:35.142
Paul.

01:54:37.378 --> 01:54:39.980
I'm here. I'm here. Hey.

01:54:43.384 --> 01:54:44.652
What happened?

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:47.522
What happened?

01:54:58.165 --> 01:54:59.701
He's dead.

01:54:59.734 --> 01:55:02.469
His vital signs are so low,
they can't be detected.

01:55:02.503 --> 01:55:03.971
But he's alive.

01:55:04.004 --> 01:55:05.506
What did you do to him?

01:55:06.974 --> 01:55:09.076
No, not that.
Why would he do that?

01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:10.177
Why would you do that?

01:55:19.253 --> 01:55:22.657
Chani, his body is fighting the
poison and he needs your help.

01:55:22.690 --> 01:55:24.091
You do it.

01:55:25.259 --> 01:55:26.360
You did this to him.

01:55:26.393 --> 01:55:28.061
You did this to your own son!

01:55:28.095 --> 01:55:29.163
You do it!

01:55:29.196 --> 01:55:31.198
Fix it yourself.

01:55:31.231 --> 01:55:34.602
Chani, you might not believe in
the prophecy, but you're a part of it.

01:55:34.636 --> 01:55:36.336
You're the poison.

01:55:36.370 --> 01:55:39.072
You and your lies.
Why would you do this?

01:55:39.106 --> 01:55:40.274
Do it.

01:56:04.799 --> 01:56:06.233
Desert Spring tears.

01:56:30.525 --> 01:56:33.761
Kwisatz Haderach,

01:56:33.795 --> 01:56:37.732
climb up. Arise.

01:56:47.407 --> 01:56:49.209
Usul, I'm here. I'm here.

01:56:58.553 --> 01:57:00.254
Are you okay?

01:57:00.287 --> 01:57:01.288
Yes.

01:57:10.397 --> 01:57:11.533
Are you sure?

01:57:15.603 --> 01:57:17.037
Thanks to you.

01:58:02.684 --> 01:58:04.284
I'm sorry about Chani.

01:58:05.787 --> 01:58:07.689
She'll come to understand.

01:58:08.590 --> 01:58:09.824
I've seen it.

01:58:11.458 --> 01:58:13.427
You can see?

01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:15.730
The visions are clear now.

01:58:17.899 --> 01:58:21.703
I see possible futures.
All at once.

01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:26.406
Our enemies are all around us.

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:28.776
And in so many futures,
they prevail.

01:58:29.711 --> 01:58:31.579
But I do see a way.

01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:35.182
There is a narrow way through.

01:58:45.459 --> 01:58:47.294
I saw our bloodline, Mother.

01:58:48.563 --> 01:58:49.897
Written across time.

01:59:02.577 --> 01:59:05.379
You are the daughter
of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

01:59:08.281 --> 01:59:09.684
Did my father know?

01:59:15.723 --> 01:59:18.893
I didn't know myself,
until I took the worm's poison.

01:59:26.768 --> 01:59:28.402
We're Harkonnens.

01:59:32.472 --> 01:59:34.542
So this is how we'll survive.

01:59:36.309 --> 01:59:37.745
By being Harkonnens.

02:01:14.776 --> 02:01:15.810
We must talk.

02:01:17.845 --> 02:01:20.748
Stilgar, you can stop this.
Do you hear me?

02:01:20.782 --> 02:01:22.482
You have the power to stop this.

02:01:22.517 --> 02:01:23.985
Northern woman!

02:01:24.018 --> 02:01:25.887
You are not allowed
to speak inside the circle.

02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:27.588
If you want to speak,
you know what to do.

02:01:27.622 --> 02:01:30.825
Stilgar, please.
For Arrakis' sake.

02:01:43.538 --> 02:01:46.473
This prophecy
is how they enslave us!

02:01:46.506 --> 02:01:48.609
How they dominate...

02:01:48.643 --> 02:01:50.443
You'll get yourself in trouble.

02:01:50.477 --> 02:01:51.913
This is none of your business.

02:01:51.946 --> 02:01:53.948
Rabban Harkonnen himself
killed my family.

02:01:53.981 --> 02:01:55.950
He gave me this scar
to remember him by.

02:01:55.983 --> 02:01:58.019
This is all of my business.

02:02:45.032 --> 02:02:47.134
Only tribe leaders can speak.

02:02:47.168 --> 02:02:49.469
If you wish to share your voice,

02:02:49.502 --> 02:02:52.439
you must take his place
by defeating him

02:02:52.472 --> 02:02:54.876
and returning his water
to the well.

02:02:54.909 --> 02:02:58.478
You think I'm stupid enough to
deprive myself of the best of us?

02:03:02.717 --> 02:03:04.852
Take my life, Usul.

02:03:04.886 --> 02:03:06.921
It is the only way.

02:03:06.954 --> 02:03:08.890
I'm pointing the way!

02:03:11.092 --> 02:03:12.627
Slow down.

02:03:48.195 --> 02:03:50.430
But you think
you could have a chance.

02:04:34.308 --> 02:04:35.943
Dune.

02:04:35.977 --> 02:04:37.611
Lisan al-Gaib!

02:04:37.645 --> 02:04:39.914
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:04:41.215 --> 02:04:42.650
Lisan al-Gaib!

02:04:53.828 --> 02:04:54.895
Muad'Dib!

02:04:54.929 --> 02:04:56.797
Muad'Dib.

02:05:21.155 --> 02:05:23.224
This is my father's
ducal signet.

02:05:33.601 --> 02:05:36.203
I am Paul Muad'Dib Atreides,

02:05:36.237 --> 02:05:38.072
Duke of Arrakis.

02:05:47.348 --> 02:05:49.083
Lisan al-Gaib!

02:05:49.116 --> 02:05:51.218
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:05:51.252 --> 02:05:55.589
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:05:55.623 --> 02:05:58.325
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:05:58.359 --> 02:06:01.328
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:06:01.362 --> 02:06:04.632
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:06:04.665 --> 02:06:07.835
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:06:07.868 --> 02:06:09.303
Lisan al-Gaib!

02:06:46.841 --> 02:06:49.110
Paul Atreides is still alive.

02:06:50.878 --> 02:06:52.379
He challenges my father.

02:06:53.848 --> 02:06:55.616
You've never been on Arrakis.

02:06:57.084 --> 02:06:59.086
It's quite impressive.
You'll see.

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:00.721
Was this all upon your advice?

02:07:00.754 --> 02:07:02.790
What?

02:07:02.823 --> 02:07:05.860
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

02:07:05.893 --> 02:07:09.230
Of course I did. Why else
would it have happened?

02:07:09.263 --> 02:07:11.699
You tried to sacrifice
an entire bloodline.

02:07:11.732 --> 02:07:13.801
And I was right to do it.

02:07:13.834 --> 02:07:16.971
The Kwisatz Haderach
is a form of power

02:07:17.004 --> 02:07:19.240
that our world has not yet seen.

02:07:19.273 --> 02:07:21.876
The ultimate power.

02:07:21.909 --> 02:07:23.744
For ninety generations,

02:07:23.777 --> 02:07:25.813
we have supervised
House Atreides.

02:07:25.846 --> 02:07:28.916
They were promising, but they
were becoming dangerously defiant.

02:07:28.949 --> 02:07:32.386
Their bloodline
had to be terminated.

02:07:32.419 --> 02:07:34.889
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

02:07:34.922 --> 02:07:35.956
Several prospects.

02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:37.424
But it's backfired.

02:07:37.458 --> 02:07:39.160
Paul is alive.

02:07:39.193 --> 02:07:41.128
And if he defeats
Feyd-Rautha, my father...

02:07:41.162 --> 02:07:45.366
Your father will lose the
throne no matter who prevails.

02:07:45.399 --> 02:07:48.402
But there is one way your
family can remain in power

02:07:48.435 --> 02:07:51.872
and, through you, the
continuation of our stewardship.

02:07:52.973 --> 02:07:54.842
One. Way.

02:07:55.442 --> 02:07:57.945
Are you prepared?

02:07:57.978 --> 02:08:00.681
You've been preparing me
my whole life, Reverend Mother.

02:08:02.983 --> 02:08:05.286
You're heading north
with the others?

02:08:05.319 --> 02:08:07.254
I'm Fedaykin.

02:08:07.288 --> 02:08:09.990
I follow my leaders. If
fighting goes north, I go north.

02:08:10.024 --> 02:08:11.392
Paul didn't have
a choice, Chani.

02:08:11.425 --> 02:08:14.061
I won't be fighting for him.

02:08:14.094 --> 02:08:15.396
I'm fighting for my people.

02:08:19.266 --> 02:08:21.101
I came to wish you best of luck.

02:08:22.369 --> 02:08:23.938
I'd wish you the same,

02:08:25.906 --> 02:08:27.474
but it seems
you've won your battle.

02:08:50.798 --> 02:08:52.099
He took the bait.

02:08:58.839 --> 02:09:00.774
Oh, the Emperor's very obliging.

02:09:01.809 --> 02:09:03.377
He's right on time.

02:09:36.477 --> 02:09:38.846
What is he doing here?

02:09:38.879 --> 02:09:40.981
I brought spice production
under control.

02:09:44.151 --> 02:09:45.319
What do we do?

02:09:46.887 --> 02:09:49.591
Send messages
to the Great Houses.

02:09:49.624 --> 02:09:53.861
Tell them that Arrakis
is under Sardaukar attack.

02:09:53.894 --> 02:09:56.564
Tell them, their future
hangs in the balance.

02:10:23.924 --> 02:10:26.427
When the storm hits this ridge,

02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.929
Gurney will open
the way for you, Stilgar,

02:10:28.962 --> 02:10:31.231
so you can enter
the basin from the West

02:10:31.265 --> 02:10:33.601
and distract
their defense systems.

02:10:33.635 --> 02:10:35.436
Chani, I want you
and your Fedaykin

02:10:35.469 --> 02:10:36.970
to then attack from the East,

02:10:37.938 --> 02:10:39.973
inside the basin.

02:10:40.007 --> 02:10:42.109
I'll strike from the
North, head on,

02:10:42.142 --> 02:10:44.211
with the Fundamentalist troops.

02:10:44.244 --> 02:10:47.081
And I'll serve Arrakeen
for dessert.

02:10:47.114 --> 02:10:49.283
Remember,
I need the Emperor alive.

02:11:49.544 --> 02:11:50.545
Hm.

02:11:58.686 --> 02:12:01.188
Baron,

02:12:01.221 --> 02:12:06.059
do you have any idea
who this Muad'Dib could be?

02:12:06.093 --> 02:12:09.062
Some fanatic, your Majesty.
That's all we know.

02:12:09.096 --> 02:12:11.098
More. More. Give me more.

02:12:11.131 --> 02:12:12.232
He's a madman!

02:12:12.266 --> 02:12:14.268
- Mad?
- All Fremen are mad.

02:12:16.638 --> 02:12:18.673
That's all you know?

02:12:18.706 --> 02:12:20.675
Really?

02:12:20.708 --> 02:12:22.443
Muad'Dib is dead.

02:12:24.746 --> 02:12:27.749
Or he went hiding
in the Southern storms

02:12:27.782 --> 02:12:29.450
which means the same thing.

02:12:30.451 --> 02:12:31.753
Your Majesty,

02:12:31.786 --> 02:12:33.320
the sand storm
that's approaching

02:12:33.353 --> 02:12:35.757
threatens the integrity
of our shields.

02:12:35.790 --> 02:12:37.991
We recommend
going back into orbit.

02:12:38.025 --> 02:12:40.065
Well, the mountains will
protect us from most of it,

02:12:41.028 --> 02:12:42.229
your Majesty.

02:12:44.031 --> 02:12:48.168
Baron, have you
ever investigated

02:12:48.202 --> 02:12:51.539
the south regions of Arrakis?

02:12:51.573 --> 02:12:54.274
Well, the entire region
is uninhabitable.

02:12:54.308 --> 02:12:57.010
It's well known, your Majesty.

02:12:57.044 --> 02:13:01.148
Your uninhabited South

02:13:01.181 --> 02:13:04.251
exhibits evidence
of human activity.

02:13:04.284 --> 02:13:06.588
I wasn't aware of this.

02:13:06.621 --> 02:13:09.156
I swear to you, I wasn't
aware of any of this.

02:13:14.161 --> 02:13:15.597
Muad'Dib is alive.

02:13:17.064 --> 02:13:18.265
I must find him.

02:14:38.713 --> 02:14:40.213
Fire!

02:15:19.887 --> 02:15:22.356
Sardaukar! On guard!

02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:37.111
Sardaukar!

02:20:42.610 --> 02:20:43.978
Grandfather.

02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:07.702
You die like an animal.

02:21:38.933 --> 02:21:39.967
Muad'Dib.

02:23:09.657 --> 02:23:10.758
Rabban!

02:23:21.869 --> 02:23:23.637
Look who's back from the dead.

02:23:37.985 --> 02:23:41.322
For my Duke, and my friends.

02:24:46.954 --> 02:24:47.988
Warships.

02:24:50.324 --> 02:24:51.425
The Great Houses.

02:24:52.993 --> 02:24:55.462
Gurney, it's time.
Bring the prisoners.

02:24:55.496 --> 02:24:59.099
My Lord.

02:25:22.957 --> 02:25:24.124
This isn't over yet.

02:25:30.130 --> 02:25:31.365
I want you to know...

02:25:34.301 --> 02:25:36.303
I will love you
as long as I breathe.

02:25:48.516 --> 02:25:50.985
There is a massed armada
in orbit.

02:25:54.388 --> 02:25:58.158
You're facing
a full invasion, Fremen.

02:25:58.192 --> 02:26:01.295
How can you be so sure the
Great Houses are here for me?

02:26:07.268 --> 02:26:11.573
They may be curious to hear my
side of the story, don't you think?

02:26:11.606 --> 02:26:16.176
I am Paul Atreides, son of
Leto Atreides, Duke of Arrakis.

02:26:18.012 --> 02:26:19.480
- Gurney.
- My Lord.

02:26:19.514 --> 02:26:21.882
Send a warning to all ships.

02:26:21.915 --> 02:26:25.853
If the Great Houses attack, our
atomics will obliterate all spice fields.

02:26:27.354 --> 02:26:30.057
- You're out of your mind.
- He's bluffing.

02:26:30.090 --> 02:26:32.159
Consider what you're
about to do, Paul Atreides.

02:26:32.192 --> 02:26:34.395
Silence!

02:26:36.564 --> 02:26:38.065
Abomination.

02:26:42.303 --> 02:26:43.871
Message sent, my Lord.

02:26:45.906 --> 02:26:49.476
As a servant of the Imperium,
you will bow at my feet.

02:26:49.511 --> 02:26:53.113
Your feet? You'll be lucky
to keep your head.

02:26:56.350 --> 02:26:57.985
I'll take the hand
of your daughter.

02:27:00.487 --> 02:27:02.489
She will remain safe.

02:27:02.524 --> 02:27:05.159
And we will rule together
over the Empire.

02:27:14.935 --> 02:27:16.170
But you...

02:27:19.039 --> 02:27:20.608
You have to answer
for my father.

02:27:28.248 --> 02:27:31.985
Do you know why I killed him?

02:27:33.253 --> 02:27:35.222
Because he was a man

02:27:35.255 --> 02:27:37.224
who believed
in the rules of the heart.

02:27:38.593 --> 02:27:40.494
But the heart
is not meant to rule.

02:27:42.096 --> 02:27:43.130
In other words...

02:27:45.533 --> 02:27:49.203
your father was a weak man.

02:27:58.278 --> 02:28:01.315
Stand or choose your champion.

02:28:04.151 --> 02:28:05.587
I am here, Atreides.

02:28:08.155 --> 02:28:09.390
I need a blade.

02:28:09.423 --> 02:28:11.058
Accept mine.

02:28:23.070 --> 02:28:26.073
Do not stain your hands
on this animal.

02:28:26.106 --> 02:28:27.441
Let me deal with him.

02:28:27.474 --> 02:28:29.209
It's my burden, Gurney.

02:28:47.729 --> 02:28:50.230
Why does he take such risks?

02:28:50.264 --> 02:28:52.567
Muad'Dib leads the way.

02:29:16.423 --> 02:29:19.727
I'm happy
to finally meet you, cousin.

02:29:21.161 --> 02:29:23.997
Cousin? Is that right?

02:29:26.266 --> 02:29:31.171
Well, you wouldn't be
the first relative I've killed.

02:29:33.775 --> 02:29:36.611
May thy knife chip and shatter.

02:29:40.047 --> 02:29:44.184
May thy knife chip and shatter.

02:30:35.202 --> 02:30:38.038
She's your pet?

02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:56.189
Any special attention
for the pet?

02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:24.812
You have fought well, Atreides.

02:32:32.553 --> 02:32:34.221
Lisan al-Gaib!

02:32:34.254 --> 02:32:36.490
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:33:29.010 --> 02:33:31.713
You should've believed.

02:33:31.746 --> 02:33:33.380
You chose the wrong side.

02:33:34.682 --> 02:33:36.349
Side?

02:33:36.383 --> 02:33:39.453
You, of all people, should know.

02:33:39.486 --> 02:33:43.858
There are no sides...
Reverend Mother.

02:34:03.044 --> 02:34:04.946
The life debt has been paid.

02:34:04.979 --> 02:34:06.824
Spare my father now and
I will be your willing bride.

02:34:06.848 --> 02:34:08.381
The throne will be yours.

02:35:40.942 --> 02:35:44.512
My Lord,
the Great Houses have answered.

02:35:44.545 --> 02:35:46.446
They refuse
to honor your ascendancy.

02:35:47.949 --> 02:35:51.085
We await your orders,
Lisan al-Gaib.

02:36:00.161 --> 02:36:01.996
Lead them to Paradise.

02:36:02.029 --> 02:36:03.698
Lisan al-Gaib!

02:36:03.731 --> 02:36:05.967
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:36:20.948 --> 02:36:24.619
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:34.962
What is happening, Mother?

02:36:37.031 --> 02:36:39.533
Your brother attacks
the Great Houses.

02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:45.505
The Holy War begins.
