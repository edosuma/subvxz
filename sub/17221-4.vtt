YOU CAN--
- SIT DOWN.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.782
- THE DEFENSE WILL ILLUSTRATE
THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY

08:01.815 --> 08:05.519
THAT THE DEFENDANT COULD HAVE
ATTEMPTED TO STEAL THIS KNIFE.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.894
IT'S--IT--

08:13.927 --> 08:14.895
[knife clattering]

08:14.928 --> 08:15.963
IT DOESN'T FIT.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.799
THE HANDLE IS TOO SMALL
FOR MY HAND.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.774
IF THE KNIFE DOESN'T FIT,
YOU MUST ACQUIT.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.909
- MR. LEWIS...
[clears throat]

08:28.942 --> 08:29.843
PLEASE APPROACH.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.178
- PERMISSION TO ALSO APPROACH,
YOU HONOR.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.646
- PERMISSION DENIED.
SIT.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.081
- OH.
- YEAH.

08:35.883 --> 08:36.917
YOU KNOW WE HAVE WITNESSES.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.253
THERE'S VIDEO FOOTAGE
OF YOU HOLDING THE KNIFE.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.822
- THINK THAT'LL BE A PROBLEM?

08:41.855 --> 08:44.825
- YOU KNOW, YOU SEEM TO BE
AN AVID STUDENT

08:44.858 --> 08:46.159
OF FILM AND TELEVISION.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.360
PERHAPS YOU'VE SEEN

08:47.394 --> 08:51.632
THE, UH, LAW & ORDER SHOW
CRIMINAL INTENT.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.867
- OKAY.
- HUH?

08:53.901 --> 08:55.669
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,

08:55.703 --> 08:57.905
I WILL SHOW THAT MY CLIENT

08:57.938 --> 09:00.974
HAD NO
LAW & ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT

09:01.008 --> 09:02.976
OF STEALING SAID KNIFE

09:03.010 --> 09:05.746
UNTIL AFTER HE ENTERED
THE GUN STORE.

09:05.779 --> 09:10.317
AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE, UH...

09:10.350 --> 09:11.652
OOH.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.822
- [coughs]
45..

09:14.855 --> 09:16.990
[high-pitched voice]
9.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.992
I LOVE THE GERMAN LANGUAGE,
DON'T YOU?

09:19.026 --> 09:22.162
- UH, CODE 459--WITHOUT PRIOR
CRIMINAL INTENT,

09:22.195 --> 09:23.831
AN ACT OF THEFT

09:23.864 --> 09:28.702
SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED
FELONY BURGLARY.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.170
BOO-YAH!

09:30.203 --> 09:31.805
I WANT THE TRUTH!

09:31.839 --> 09:33.741
I CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!

09:33.774 --> 09:36.009
- THAT'S RECESS.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.811
RECESS FOR TWO HOURS.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.814
[ahem] SO WHERE DO WE GO
TO GET THESE GUNS?

09:40.848 --> 09:42.816
- I DON'T KNOW.
MINE ARE STATE-ISSUED.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.952
- I WONDER
WHERE THE DEFENDANT WENT.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.854
HE HAD A REVOLVER,
A SEMIAUTOMATIC,

09:46.887 --> 09:48.989
AND SOME OLD-TIMEY
DUELING PISTOLS PULLED ON HIM.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.958
OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE
A WIDE SELECTION.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.761
OH, WELL, GUNS, GUNS, GUNS.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.328
- JUDGE, I'M REALLY GLAD
WE'RE DOING THIS.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.396
[gunshot]
- MM-HMM.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.731
- YOU'RE NOT JUST MY BOSS.
- NO.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.766
- YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
- I AM.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.000
- AND IF ANYTHING
WERE TO EVER HAPPEN TO YOU--

10:00.033 --> 10:02.770
- OKAY, NOPE, NO, NO, GOING
TO A MUSHY PLACE, FREAKING OUT--

10:02.803 --> 10:04.772
MAKE IT STOP.
- THERE IS A GIANT EX-CON

10:04.805 --> 10:06.339
AFTER YOU,
AND YOU'RE FREAKING OUT

10:06.373 --> 10:08.876
ABOUT A LITTLE EMOTION?
- YEAH. YIPPEE-KI-AY.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.177
- WHOA, HEY, HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.879
YOU DON'T JUST SHOOT
YOUR WEAPON.

10:11.912 --> 10:12.980
YOUR FIRST DEFENSE
START HERE.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.782
GUN FACE.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.916
- ALL RIGHT,
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.719
- WELL, IT'S BASICALLY
MY "WHO ATE ALL THE PIE?" FACE

10:18.752 --> 10:20.420
- YEAH.
- BUT WITH CRAZY EYES.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.823
[gunshot]
SO IT'D BE LIKE...

10:22.856 --> 10:24.224
- YEAH, I LIKE THAT.
- RIGHT?

10:24.257 --> 10:26.359
- ALL RIGHT. I LIKE TO TRY
BEFORE I BUY, SO...

10:26.393 --> 10:27.895
- LADIES FIRST.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.036
WHOO! NICE!

10:36.069 --> 10:38.105
HELLO, YOUR HONOR.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.841
SOMEONE'S BEEN PLAYING A LITTLE
LATE-NIGHT CALL OF DUTY.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.010
- NAH, I GREW UP WITH GUNS.

10:43.043 --> 10:46.013
WHEN JANNA HUNSINGER'S DAD
WAS TAKING HER TO BALLET CLASS,

10:46.046 --> 10:50.183
MY DAD WAS TAKING ME
TO THE DESERT TO BLAST TIN CANS.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.185
I WAS THE ONLY 11-YEAR-OLD
IN THE COUNTY

10:52.219 --> 10:54.121
WITH A LICENSE TO CARRY.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.856
- THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.158
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
YOU'RE UP, COWBOY.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.260
- [clears throat]

11:00.293 --> 11:01.762
[gunshot]

11:01.795 --> 11:06.700
AAH!

11:06.734 --> 11:08.001
NAILED IT!

11:08.035 --> 11:09.870
BOOM!

11:09.903 --> 11:10.904
WHOO!

11:10.938 --> 11:12.105
[gunshots]

11:12.139 --> 11:15.242
- THIS IS MY "BAILIFF SCREAMS
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL" FACE.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.309
- THAT IS HURTFUL.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.883
- THIS CAR IS LIKE
A CORRECTIVE TODDLER SHOE.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.718
- WOMEN LOVE BABY SHOES.
THEY THINK IT'S CUTE.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.019
- WELL, NOT EVERYTHING SMALL
IS CUTE.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.721
- AH, AH, LEFT MY WALLET
IN THE CAR.

11:27.755 --> 11:28.688
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.892
- HEY. NO--
HEY, STAY IN MY SIGHTS, OKAY?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.861
- OH, COME ON,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS, TEDWARD.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.829
- HEY, I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

11:35.863 --> 11:36.964
- OH!

11:38.231 --> 11:40.868
JUDGE HERNANDEZ.
- YOU IDIOT! GET OFF ME!

11:40.901 --> 11:42.335
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON VACATION.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.436
- I WAS!

11:43.470 --> 11:45.005
WOULD YOU STOP?

11:45.038 --> 11:47.007
- OKAY, IS NOW A BAD TIME

11:47.040 --> 11:49.176
TO TAKE A CRACK
AT RESORT-CASUAL BOLO TIE?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.378
'CAUSE I AM SITTING
ON A GOOD ONE, SIR.

11:57.517 --> 11:57.951
.

11:57.985 --> 11:58.952
- I SHOULD CHARGE YOU
WITH CONTEMPT FOR ALLOWING

11:59.619 --> 12:01.054
YOUR BAILIFF
TO BODY-SLAM ME!

12:01.088 --> 12:02.189
- YOU HONOR, I AM SORRY.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.423
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT HER.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.892
- HE THOUGHT
YOU WERE SOMEONE ELSE.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.059
WE'RE SO SORRY.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.761
SIR, THAT WILL NEVER
HAPPEN AGAIN.

12:07.795 --> 12:08.996
- TOM CALLED ME
ABOUT THE CHARLIE LEWIS CASE.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.298
- HE TATTLED?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.133
- JUDGE WRIGHT,
I AM WELL AWARE

12:13.166 --> 12:14.868
OF YOUR FEELINGS
ABOUT THREE STRIKES.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.203
YOU ARE NOT HERE
TO FIX THE LAW.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.905
YOU'RE HERE TO UPHOLD IT.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.439
DO YOUR JOB.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.174
NOW, I'M OFF TO MY MASSAGE.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.811
- YOU WANT ME TO--
- [blusters]

12:23.844 --> 12:27.047
IF I'M CALLED AWAY TO DEAL
WITH ANY MORE OF YOUR NONSENSE,

12:27.080 --> 12:29.182
THERE WILL BE
NO HAPPY ENDING.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.751
I HEARD IT.
NOT A WORD.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.056
both:
HE SAID "HAPPY ENDING."

12:36.089 --> 12:38.892
[both laughing]

12:38.926 --> 12:40.193
- HE IS MAD, THOUGH, HUH?

12:40.227 --> 12:42.029
- YEAH, DUDE.
OKAY, DUDE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:42.062 --> 12:43.897
I'M ABOUT TO GO
ALL COMMANDING OFFICER

12:43.931 --> 12:46.934
FROM EVERY BAD COP MOVIE
EVER MADE ON YOUR ASS.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.902
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH CRAP
I JUST ATE

12:48.936 --> 12:50.904
FOR THAT LITTLE STUNT
YOU PULLED BACK THERE?

12:50.938 --> 12:53.073
YOU'RE A GOOD OFFICER,
BUT YOU'RE A HOTHEAD.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.209
AND YOU'RE COSTING MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS TO THE CITY

12:56.243 --> 12:58.912
IN DAMAGES.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.014
I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THAT.

13:01.048 --> 13:01.882
- NO, THAT WAS GOOD.
- YEAH?

13:01.915 --> 13:04.117
- THAT WAS INTIMIDATING.
I WAS SCARED.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.186
- I'M SERIOUS, AND THE POINT IS,
YOU GOT TO STAND DOWN, TEDWARD.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.520
- AH. LOOK, I FEAR
FOR YOUR SAFETY.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.156
I THINK YOU STILL MIGHT BE
IN A LITTLE DANGER.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.024
- WELL, OKAY, BUT THERE'S
MORE PRESSING ISSUES

13:11.058 --> 13:13.526
THAN THE HYPOTHETICAL PROBLEM
OF BYRON, OKAY?

13:13.560 --> 13:14.727
IF I DON'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO HELP CHARLIE,

13:14.761 --> 13:17.064
HE'S GONNA END UP SPENDING
THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN JAIL.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.198
- YOU THINK I WANT
TO HEAR THIS ANYMORE?

13:18.231 --> 13:20.067
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!
SHUT--STOP!

13:20.100 --> 13:21.068
STOP!

13:21.101 --> 13:22.369
OH, I SEE.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.536
I SEE. OKAY.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.038
OKAY, YEAH, YEAH,
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.173
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.507
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I'M IN CHARGE!

13:27.540 --> 13:29.376
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
- OH, MY GOD.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.911
- OH.
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.112
- THAT IS NOT GOOD.

13:32.145 --> 13:36.083
- I NEED YOUR EXPERT PSYCHIATRIC
OPINION ON CHARLIE LEWIS.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.052
I THINK HE'S NOT JUST--
HMM, HOW SHOULD I SAY--DIM.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.921
I THINK HE MIGHT BE CUCKOO
FOR COCOA PUFFS.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.090
I MEAN, TOTAL CUCKOO-ROO
NUT BALLS MCGEE.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.358
- OKAY, YEAH, I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S THE OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS

13:45.392 --> 13:46.593
THAT WE USE, BUT--

13:46.626 --> 13:48.028
- CAN YOU EVALUATE HIM
FOR ME, PLEASE?

13:48.061 --> 13:50.497
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANYTHING CLINICAL--

13:50.530 --> 13:51.664
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,

13:51.698 --> 13:53.533
I CAN PROBABLY GET THE JURY
TO MAYBE GO EASIER ON HIM.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.035
- [clears throat]
DR. BOYD, JUDGE...

13:55.068 --> 13:57.204
- HMM?
- YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.072
BLOCKED PHONE CALL
ON LINE ONE.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.307
- [breathing heavily]
- OOH.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.110
- LET ME FIND BYRON CASH
AND SHUT THIS DOWN.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.879
- NO. TEDWARD, COME ON--
- PLEASE, THIS DUDE IS CRAZY.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.080
- TEDWARD, THAT COULD BE

14:07.114 --> 14:08.982
THIS ASTHMATIC HAMMER THROWER
I DATED.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.384
JUST LET IT GO.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.887
- OKAY, UM,
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

14:13.921 --> 14:16.556
- OH, WELL, THERE WAS A CIRCUS
COMING THROUGH TOWN,

14:16.589 --> 14:17.925
AND THIS GUY THREW HAMMERS.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.459
IT WAS PRETTY HOT.
YOU HAD TO BE THERE.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.228
- NO, NO, NOT THAT.
THAT.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.931
- OH, OH, YEAH. NO, THERE'S
THIS EX-CON THAT I PUT AWAY.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.232
HE MAY OR MAY NOT BE
STALKING ME.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.566
TEDWARD'S FREAKING OUT.
- WHAT?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.035
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

14:28.068 --> 14:29.569
- BECAUSE...
- NO, NO, NO--THAT'S IT.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.905
I'M STAYING OVER.
- OH, HEY, HEY, EASY, TIGER.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.907
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN GUNNING
FOR THAT TOOTHBRUSH POSITION,

14:33.941 --> 14:35.909
AND IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
- [sighs]

14:35.943 --> 14:37.377
COME ON, I'M REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU,

14:37.410 --> 14:39.079
YOU KNOW, AS A FRIEND
AND SOMEONE WHO CARES.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.513
- WELL, DON'T WORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.382
WE'VE GOT EXCELLENT SECURITY
HERE AT THE COURTHOUSE,

14:42.415 --> 14:44.184
AS YOU CAN SEE,
AND I'M GONNA GET A GUN.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.920
- YOU? A GUN? THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.288
YOU HAVE A TEMPER.
- NO, I DON'T.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.057
- YEAH, YOU DO.
YOU TELL ME ALL THE TIME.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.391
- NO, BUT JUST HEARING
YOU SAY IT

14:51.424 --> 14:53.560
MAKES ME WANT TO THUMP YOU
IN THE NARDS, GARY!

14:53.593 --> 14:55.095
- INTERESTING.
- [growls]

14:55.128 --> 14:58.231
SERIOUSLY, GARY...

14:58.265 --> 15:01.034
PLEASE, WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST TALK TO CHARLIE?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.103
- ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M STAYING
OVER TONIGHT, OKAY?

15:03.136 --> 15:04.171
AND I'M BRINGING
MY SWIFFER SWEEPER

15:04.204 --> 15:06.306
WITH MY STEAK KNIFE DUCT-TAPED
TO THE END OF IT.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.975
- OOH, I FEEL SAFER ALREADY.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.542
- GO AHEAD, DOC.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.711
[Austrian accent]
I WILL OPEN MY MIND TO YOU.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.679
- THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
FREUD IMPRESSION.

15:12.712 --> 15:15.048
- [normal voice]
NO, THAT WAS SCHWARZENEGGER

15:15.082 --> 15:17.250
FROM TOTAL RECALL.
I JUST LIKE DOING IT.

15:17.284 --> 15:20.053
- CHARLIE, YOUR CRIMES SO FAR
HAVE BEEN THEFT RELATED.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.221
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN,

15:21.254 --> 15:22.722
HOW UNCONTROLLABLE
IS YOUR URGE

15:22.755 --> 15:24.224
TO TAKE THINGS
THAT ARE NOT YOURS?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.559
- ZERO.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.362
- THAT'S WEIRD.
I JUST HAD MY PEN.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.498
HEY, CHARLIE, IS THAT MY PEN?

15:31.531 --> 15:33.033
- THIS?
- YEAH.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.168
- NO.
IT'S--IT'S, UH...

15:35.202 --> 15:37.204
FOOT SCRATCHER.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.106
HEY, THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.308
I BREAST-FED TILL I WAS FIVE.
IS THAT A THING?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.143
'CAUSE IT FEELS
LIKE IT MIGHT BE A THING.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.078
[elevator bell dings]
- SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU SUFFER

15:45.112 --> 15:46.746
FROM AN IMPULSE-CONTROL
DISORDER,

15:46.779 --> 15:49.416
EXACERBATED BY CONCURRENT
PERSONALITY DISORDERS,

15:49.449 --> 15:51.451
WHICH MANIFEST
MOSTLY AS KLEPTOMANIA.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.021
- WHOO-HOO.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.222
- YEAH.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.558
YOU KNOW, MY--MY TESTIMONY
COULD HELP YOU GET LESS TIME.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.227
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

16:00.260 --> 16:02.062
AS MY ATTORNEY,

16:02.095 --> 16:05.565
I'VE ADVISED MYSELF NOT TO ALLOW
THAT INTO EVIDENCE.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.234
- CHARLIE, YOU KNOW
THIS COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE

16:07.267 --> 16:09.302
BETWEEN A FEW YEARS
AND FOREVER.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.303
- I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.

16:10.337 --> 16:14.241
I GOT THIS JURY WRAPPED
AROUND MY LITTLE FINGER.

16:14.274 --> 16:18.111
BESIDES, I DON'T WANT TO BE
LABELED AS CRAZY.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.579
THAT KIND OF THING
DOESN'T SIT TOO WELL

16:19.612 --> 16:21.148
WITH THE LADIES.
[squeaks lips]

16:21.181 --> 16:23.416
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.118
- OH!

16:25.152 --> 16:26.419
SORRY, MY MAN.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.122
I BELIEVE THESE ARE YOURS.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.727
- HEY.
- UH--IT WASN'T ME.

16:34.761 --> 16:35.728
I DIDN'T CALL HERNANDEZ.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.098
- DO YOU KISS YOUR WIFE
WITH THAT LYING MOUTH?

16:38.131 --> 16:39.032
- TIPPY DOESN'T ALLOW
MOUTH KISSING.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.568
- LISTEN,
GARY EVALUATED CHARLIE, OKAY?

16:41.601 --> 16:44.371
HE'S GOT SOME EXTENSIVE MENTAL
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES,

16:44.404 --> 16:46.139
BUT HE WON'T ALLOW THEM ADMITTED
INTO THE CASE.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.408
I MEAN, YOU REALLY WANT TO THROW
THE BOOK AT A GUY

16:48.441 --> 16:50.510
THAT'S TOO INCOMPETENT
TO DEFEND HIMSELF?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.079
- DO YOU REALLY WANT TO LIVE
IN A WORLD

16:52.112 --> 16:53.213
WHERE GUYS LIKE CHARLIE

16:53.246 --> 16:55.648
CAN JUST REPEAT THEIR
BAD BEHAVIOR AGAIN AND AGAIN?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.751
- NO, TOM, I WANT TO LIVE
IN A WORLD WHERE NOBODY POOPS

16:58.785 --> 17:01.121
AND THE MATRIX SEQUELS
DON'T SUCK, OKAY?

17:01.154 --> 17:03.223
BUT THIS IS A GUY'S LIFE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.291
- ALL RIGHT, REBECCA,

17:04.324 --> 17:06.526
THIS GOES ALL THE WAY
BACK TO LAW SCHOOL, RIGHT?

17:06.559 --> 17:08.761
YOU'RE THIS KNOW-IT-ALL
THAT'S BIGGER THAN THE RULES.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.597
THE RULES DON'T APPLY
TO YOU, ALL RIGHT?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.099
I FOLLOW THE RULES.
- I KNOW.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.600
- RULES MAKE LIFE FAIR,

17:13.633 --> 17:15.235
BUT YOU HAVE
TO ENFORCE THEM, OKAY?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.237
SO TAKE GARY'S--
- OH, GREAT, THANK YOU!

17:17.270 --> 17:20.240
- OH, NO, THAT WAS NOT--
COME ON, THAT WASN'T ON PURPOSE.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.774
I WAS JUST--
[light arguing]

17:24.711 --> 17:27.580
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

17:36.089 --> 17:36.289
.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.157
- YOU PUT ME AWAY
FOR FIVE YEARS, JUDGE.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.392
- I WAS NOT ON THAT...

17:39.426 --> 17:41.361
PARTICULAR CASE.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.832
- AND I JUST WANT
TO SAY THANK YOU.

17:45.865 --> 17:49.402
- BECAUSE PRISON TURNED OUT
TO BE SO DELIGHTFUL?

17:49.436 --> 17:51.371
- I WAS GOING DOWN A BAD ROAD,

17:51.404 --> 17:53.340
BUT I WASN'T SOME KIND OF THUG
THAT HURT PEOPLE.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.476
THE SYSTEM WAS SET UP TO JUST
THROW ME OUT LIKE GARBAGE,

17:56.509 --> 17:58.211
BUT YOU DIDN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.647
YEAH, I GOT TIME,

18:00.680 --> 18:03.516
BUT NOT SO MUCH
I COULDN'T HAVE A SECOND CHANCE.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.584
- MM.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.287
- THIS IS MY FAMILY.
- SURE.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.257
- OH, WOW.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.325
CUTE KIDS, BYRON.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.826
TOM...

18:13.860 --> 18:16.329
SOMETIMES I DO KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.198
- YES, THIS ONE ODDLY,

18:18.231 --> 18:19.832
COINCIDENTALLY
VERY SIMILAR CASE.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.369
I WILL THINK ABOUT IT.
DON'T RUB IT IN, OKAY?

18:22.402 --> 18:23.370
- IS THAT YOUR GRANDMA?

18:23.403 --> 18:25.172
- THAT'S MY WIFE.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.840
- AH, WELL...

18:27.874 --> 18:29.142
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, BYRON.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.210
- THANKS AGAIN.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.378
[groaning]

18:31.411 --> 18:33.680
- OH. WHA--
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.848
- WHOO!
I GOT YOUR BACK, REBECCA!

18:35.882 --> 18:38.851
- TEDWARD!
HE WAS THANKING ME!

18:38.885 --> 18:40.753
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.689
OH, MAN, HEY.
HEY, BRO. HEY.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.591
HEY, DO NOT SUE ME.
I CAN'T--

18:44.624 --> 18:46.426
OH, I DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.895
- MAN, HIS GRANDMA/WIFE'S
GONNA BE PISSED.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.398
GENTLEMEN, YOU'VE REACHED
AN AGREEMENT?

18:51.431 --> 18:52.665
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.834
THE DEFENDANT
AGREES TO PLEAD GUILTY

18:54.867 --> 18:56.503
TO MISDEMEANOR BURGLARY

18:56.536 --> 18:57.837
AND WILL SERVE TWO YEARS

18:57.870 --> 19:00.407
AT A MINIMUM-SECURITY
PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.674
- I THINK...

19:01.708 --> 19:03.676
- THINK THE PUNISHMENT
FITS THE CRIME.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.346
- AND 'CAUSE I DIDN'T GET
TO GIVE CLOSING STATEMENT

19:06.379 --> 19:07.880
IN FRONT OF THE JURY--

19:07.914 --> 19:09.382
- WELL--
- YOU PROMISED.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.551
NO BACKSIES.
- NO BACKSIES, TOM.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.953
- ALMOST FORGOT
ABOUT NO BACKSIES.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.224
YES, THE PROSECUTION, IN TURN,
WILL ALLOW MR. LEWIS

19:17.257 --> 19:20.360
TO PRESENT HIS CLOSING STATEMENT
TO THE COURT.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.495
HE'S ALL YOURS.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.796
- THANK YOU, THOMAS.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.336
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY...

19:29.369 --> 19:32.539
"THESE PEOPLE DON'T DREAM
ABOUT BEING RICH.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.342
"THEY DREAM ABOUT BEING ABLE
TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN

19:35.375 --> 19:36.676
"SWIM IN A POOL

19:36.709 --> 19:38.378
"WITHOUT WORRYING
THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET

19:38.411 --> 19:40.447
A HYSTERECTOMY
BY THE AGE OF 20!"

19:40.480 --> 19:42.882
- ERIN BROCKOVICH.
- YES.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.551
- GREAT FLICK.
- YEAH.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.352
- SHE HAD GREAT BRAS.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.221
- YEAH, I JUST REMEMBER
HER BOOBS.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.257
- WELL DONE, SIR.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.694
both: HEY.
- WHAT'S UP?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.363
- CAME TO RESET
YOUR SECURITY SYSTEM,

19:56.396 --> 19:57.864
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
- MM-HMM.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.600
- GARY'S NOT MUCH OF A BODYGUARD
AND YOU WON'T GET A GUN.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.236
- OH, NO, NO, I GOT A GUN.
LOOK, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.504
PRETTY CUTE, HUH?
JUDY GOT IT FOR ME.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.672
- NOT BAD.
- YEAH.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.340
YOU KNOW WHAT?
AND THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE

20:07.374 --> 20:08.941
I FEEL COMFORTABLE
CARRYING A GUN.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.344
YOU WERE WRONG
ABOUT BYRON, ALL RIGHT?

20:11.378 --> 20:14.347
I TOLD YOU--I DON'T EVER WANT
TO BE WRONG ABOUT SOMEBODY

20:14.381 --> 20:15.848
WHILE CARRYING A GUN,

20:15.882 --> 20:19.286
BUT I DID GET THIS BAD BOY.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.454
RARR!
PSHH!

20:21.488 --> 20:22.855
MY DAD TAUGHT ME HOW TO USE IT.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.524
TAUGHT THE WHOLE FAMILY--
BIG HUNTING PEOPLE.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.327
- WHO IS YOUR FAMILY--
DUCK DYNASTY?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.929
OKAY, SO WHAT ABOUT THE NOTE
THAT BYRON LEFT ON YOUR CAR?

20:29.962 --> 20:31.998
- OH, THAT WAS JUDY.
- "YOU READY TO DIE?"

20:32.031 --> 20:32.932
YEAH, I WANTED TO SEE

20:32.965 --> 20:35.502
IF SHE WANTED TO GO
TO A HOT-YOGA CLASS.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.770
BY THE WAY, I MIGHT HAVE
BUTT-DIALED YOU DURING HOT YOGA.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.572
SORRY.
- LINE ONE.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.973
- OKAY, HEAVY BREATHING.
- MM-HMM.

20:41.007 --> 20:41.908
- CAN I TAKE A BATH IN YOUR TUB?

20:41.941 --> 20:44.877
MINE'S ALL FULL OF BUTTONS
AND DOLL HEADS.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.014
LONG STORY.
- YOU KNOW THE WAY.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.851
YOU WANT TO HANG OUT
WHILE JUDY BATHES?

20:51.884 --> 20:52.652
- NO, NOT REALLY.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.387
I MEAN, GARY
HAS A SWIFFER SPEAR.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.356
YOU GOT A CROSSBOW,
AND JUDY NAKED.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.391
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST PARK YOUR ASS DOWN, OKAY?

20:58.425 --> 21:01.394
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MADE ME LEARN HER NAME.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.362
- HEY.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.030
I ALMOST KILLED NAKED JUDY.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.399
- YOU WANT IT SHAKEN
OR STIRRED?

21:06.433 --> 21:09.369
- CLOTHED.
- TOO LATE FOR THAT, MY FRIEND.
