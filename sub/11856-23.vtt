WEBVTT

00:28.125 --> 00:30.000
Black and white is, like..

00:30.083 --> 00:31.208
...so beautiful.

00:31.291 --> 00:33.875
Can't believe I made
my Joseph Shaw signature

00:33.959 --> 00:36.417
popcorn for these guys.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.542
- And they're asleep!
- What?

00:38.625 --> 00:40.834
What's going on?

00:40.917 --> 00:43.250
Joseph, next time I'm
picking the movie,
man.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.625
I'm trying to broaden
your mind, Corey

00:44.709 --> 00:46.166
but that's fine, whatever.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.709
Bad enough you keep us sober.

00:47.792 --> 00:50.583
You make us watch
black and white movies too.

00:50.667 --> 00:53.959
Alright, that's it guys,
Lights out.

00:54.041 --> 00:56.959
Come on, everybody up.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.125
'Let's go.'

00:58.208 --> 00:59.500
Up.

00:59.583 --> 01:01.166
(Crystal)
'I'm eating,
like,
so much sugar'

01:01.250 --> 01:02.792
I totally can't sleep, I bet.

01:02.875 --> 01:04.709
Read a book in your room.

01:04.792 --> 01:06.583
I'll walk you back, Crystal.

01:07.542 --> 01:11.000
Hey, y'all,
you made it.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.875
One more day
clean and sober.

01:12.959 --> 01:13.875
Yeah.

01:13.959 --> 01:16.041
Yeah, way to go, man.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.875
Get sleep, alright. Okay?

01:17.959 --> 01:19.000
Alright.

01:21.583 --> 01:23.417
Take care. Come on.

02:06.583 --> 02:08.709
Corey?

02:13.792 --> 02:15.542
Orlando.

02:15.625 --> 02:16.583
Help!

02:16.667 --> 02:19.542
Somebody help!

02:22.792 --> 02:24.291
Help!

03:13.250 --> 03:14.875
Hi.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.667
What's with your hand?

03:19.750 --> 03:21.125
Nothin'.

03:21.208 --> 03:23.208
Kinda looks broken.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.375
Uh, looks worse
than it feels.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.041
You get in a fight
or something?

03:27.125 --> 03:29.417
Nah.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.792
(Stillman)
'Got a call from East.'

03:30.875 --> 03:32.917
Someone just tried
to use the credit card

03:33.000 --> 03:35.500
of a murder victim
from last year.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.625
Where?

03:37.709 --> 03:40.333
Check cashing place in
Kensington, two days
ago.

03:40.417 --> 03:41.834
Wallet was taken off
the body?

03:41.917 --> 03:43.500
(Rush)
'Who's the victim?'

03:43.583 --> 03:46.500
Ah, Joseph Shaw, he died last
year. He was a murder witness.

03:46.583 --> 03:47.792
Shot two weeks before

03:47.875 --> 03:49.750
he was supposed to
ID the doer in court.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.709
Didn't pin his death on
the guy he was going to
finger?

03:51.792 --> 03:54.125
No, they lost traction.
Shaw's case went cold.

03:54.208 --> 03:55.542
Till today.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.709
When someone gets
the bright idea of using

03:57.792 --> 03:59.625
a dead man's credit card.

03:59.709 --> 04:02.291
Hope whatever they bought
was worth it.

04:36.542 --> 04:37.834
(Miller)
'So, I heard something'

04:37.917 --> 04:39.834
I got to
ask you about?

04:39.917 --> 04:41.625
Okay.

04:41.709 --> 04:44.333
It true you keep pictures
of victims next to your bed

04:44.417 --> 04:46.792
when you're working
on a case?

04:46.875 --> 04:48.291
Where'd you hear that?

04:48.375 --> 04:49.500
People talk.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.625
'Just seems
a little freaky.'

04:52.709 --> 04:56.250
Easy to look at all
the files and boxes.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.458
Forget the
lives
behind them.

05:00.208 --> 05:01.375
Joseph Shaw, 38.

05:01.458 --> 05:02.709
He was killed
right
before he was set

05:02.792 --> 05:04.875
to testify
against
Corey Lewis.

05:04.959 --> 05:07.375
Shotgun blast to the face,
through the door.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.667
So, suspect number one
is Corey

05:09.750 --> 05:11.417
who didn't want Joseph
taking the stand?

05:11.500 --> 05:14.041
But Corey was in jail
when Joseph was killed.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.542
Oh, cops figured
he must've reached out

05:15.625 --> 05:16.875
gotten someone else to do it.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.709
Yeah, but the kid didn't
seem to have much reach.

05:18.792 --> 05:20.500
Was a loner who
lived
at a rehab center

05:20.583 --> 05:22.125
called Robinson Teen House.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.083
Place Joseph worked
as a counselor.

05:24.166 --> 05:27.041
Know him from my narcotics
days.
Treats drug addicted teens

05:27.125 --> 05:28.834
from all backgrounds.
Has a great rep.

05:28.917 --> 05:30.667
(John)
'Yeah, started by
Jane and Ted Robinson'

05:30.750 --> 05:32.041
big Philly philanthropists.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.125
Neighbor who ID'd
the body told the cops

05:34.208 --> 05:36.333
Robinson House
was Joseph's life.

05:36.417 --> 05:39.125
So maybe the Robinsons can
tell us more about our
victim.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.500
Let's find out
what Corey knows

05:40.583 --> 05:43.041
about this credit card
being used.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.333
Now here's a guy

05:44.417 --> 05:47.125
who wouldn't look so bad
on a bedside table.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.959
'We started this place
after our son'

06:02.041 --> 06:05.333
Tom died of a meth overdose.

06:05.417 --> 06:06.917
Being here has
helped us as much as

06:07.000 --> 06:09.750
it's helped any of the
kids, to tell you the
truth.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.417
Did you know
Joseph Shaw well?

06:11.500 --> 06:14.250
Sure, and the
kids loved Joseph.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.166
Well, he sweated through
rehab with them

06:16.250 --> 06:18.125
every step of the way.

06:18.208 --> 06:20.417
He struggled with heroin
himself, growing up.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.500
He even did a few months
in jail before he got
clean.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.417
So he knew what the kids
were going through.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.375
With a lot of social
workers,
the kids are just a file.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.333
But Joseph always said
it was important

06:31.417 --> 06:34.125
to see the lives
behind the file.

06:34.208 --> 06:35.458
And he did.

06:37.208 --> 06:38.667
Can you tell us
about his relationship

06:38.750 --> 06:41.875
with, uh, Corey,
the boy accused of murder?

06:41.959 --> 06:44.750
Corey was like our
son Tom in a lot of ways.

06:44.834 --> 06:48.959
He was tough,
put up walls.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.750
But Joseph knew
how to get through them.

06:51.834 --> 06:53.667
Right from the start.

06:55.875 --> 06:58.375
Let me out
of this damn prison!

06:58.458 --> 06:59.583
The new guy's
freaking out!

06:59.667 --> 07:00.834
Chill out, bro!

07:00.917 --> 07:03.000
Corey, we know
what you're going through.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.208
You don't know anything!

07:04.291 --> 07:06.417
You just met me
yesterday, bitch.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.166
Let him slam.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.834
My son used to do this kind of
thing all the time

07:09.917 --> 07:11.083
ending in hospitals.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.166
You're a strong bastard,
aren't you?

07:14.250 --> 07:17.250
- I'm getting out of here,
man.
- No, you're not.

07:17.333 --> 07:20.083
You know, when I was using, man
I was hollowed out and weak.

07:20.166 --> 07:21.583
What the hell are you
talkin' about?

07:21.667 --> 07:23.333
You're in here because
you're an addict, man.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.458
- You got a disease.
- That's bull, man!

07:25.542 --> 07:27.000
Denial!
Been there, done that!

07:27.083 --> 07:28.625
What we do here, Corey,
is we try to help you

07:28.709 --> 07:30.166
kick addiction's ass.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.375
'It takes some serious muscle.'

07:32.458 --> 07:33.709
There's a dent
in that door tells me

07:33.792 --> 07:35.875
you're strong enough
to pull it off.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.667
Bet I could put a dent
in that door.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.583
I'd rather see you get
to Group, Orlando.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.333
You put that strength
in the right direction

07:41.417 --> 07:43.041
you're gonna be a star here.

07:58.166 --> 08:00.917
We thought Corey was
getting on track after that.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.709
Was there anyone
Corey was close to

08:02.792 --> 08:05.458
who could have
convinced to kill Joseph

08:05.542 --> 08:06.792
stop him from testifying?

08:06.875 --> 08:08.125
'No.'

08:08.208 --> 08:11.083
The other kids just didn't
seem
to connect with Corey.

08:16.208 --> 08:19.208
(Valens)
'Orlando and the witness
to his murder are dead.'

08:19.291 --> 08:20.875
'And you're free as a bird.'

08:21.000 --> 08:22.917
Things worked out pretty good
for you, didn't they, Corey?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.375
Look, I don't have
to talk about Orlando.

08:25.458 --> 08:26.875
Those charges were dropped.

08:26.959 --> 08:29.208
Fine. Let's talk
about Joseph.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.667
I liked him.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.750
And I got an airtight alibi
for the night he was killed.

08:33.834 --> 08:35.458
Oh. Someone just used
his credit cards.

08:35.542 --> 08:37.208
You got any ideas
about that?

08:37.291 --> 08:40.375
No, but I'll tell you
what I think.

08:40.458 --> 08:41.792
I think what
sank Joseph

08:41.875 --> 08:44.917
is the same thing
that always sinks a
guy.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.625
Women.

08:46.709 --> 08:48.750
It's romantic
of you, Corey.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.125
You know it's true.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.041
Come on, you've been sunk,
too, right?

08:55.750 --> 08:57.500
Why don't you tell us what
the hell you're talkin' about?

08:57.583 --> 09:01.417
I'm talking about
how love makes people crazy.

09:05.542 --> 09:08.625
I couldn't keep my girlfriend,
'cause I was always lying

09:08.709 --> 09:10.375
sneaking off
to get a fix.

09:10.458 --> 09:12.208
'She kept bustin' me.'

09:12.291 --> 09:14.667
The drug's like
our secret affair, right?

09:14.750 --> 09:16.625
The lies catch up with us,
'cause we ain't nearly

09:16.709 --> 09:18.750
as smart
as we think we are.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.625
Jasmine was my dream girl, too.

09:20.709 --> 09:22.166
How so?

09:22.250 --> 09:24.667
I don't know.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.000
She was hot.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.667
What about you, Joseph?
Who's your dream girl?

09:30.750 --> 09:33.583
I don't have a lot of time
for relationships right now.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.709
I got my hands full
with you punks.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.458
Oh, must be something
that turns up your
temperature.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.959
Guess it would be someone smart

09:42.041 --> 09:45.000
as passionate about
her work as I am.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.917
And not allergic to cats.

09:50.375 --> 09:51.875
How about you, Corey?

09:54.417 --> 09:55.500
Someone fine.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.917
'You know, who dresses nice.'

09:58.000 --> 10:00.500
Someone who gives
a damn about me.

10:01.750 --> 10:04.375
See, that's
an important step, Corey.

10:04.458 --> 10:07.542
'Cause you're right,
you deserve that, man.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.208
I mean, you all do.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.500
I get your
subliminal message, Joseph.

10:12.583 --> 10:13.750
What message?

10:13.834 --> 10:15.291
Just because
I'm allergic to
cats

10:15.375 --> 10:16.875
and I'm too young
to be all
passionate

10:16.959 --> 10:18.375
about some dumb job..

10:18.458 --> 10:20.125
Stop acting like
a freak, Crystal.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.917
You should be with someone
your own age, anyways.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.917
Joseph, we could seriously
make it together.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.250
Don't just reject me.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.625
Crystal, I'm not rejecting
you
as a person

10:27.709 --> 10:28.667
but there's no chance of--

10:28.750 --> 10:30.709
Stop! I can't even look at you!

10:30.792 --> 10:33.750
Your face is, like,
haunting me, okay?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.709
Crystal.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.250
'It might be best
for you to have group'

10:37.333 --> 10:39.834
with a different counselor.

10:39.917 --> 10:42.208
I can't survive like this.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.542
I'm gonna kill myself.

10:44.625 --> 10:47.208
Or I'm gonna kill you.

10:51.709 --> 10:55.417
Soon as I heard
Joseph got shot in the face

10:55.500 --> 10:57.458
I thought Crazy Crystal.

11:51.208 --> 11:52.458
Crystal Eckersdorf?

11:53.959 --> 11:56.917
Detectives Jeffries
and Miller, Philly PD.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.291
I'm out of jail and out
of trouble's the sweet
thing.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.625
'So, even though
you're cops'

12:02.709 --> 12:04.250
I'm not nervous right now.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.458
We're about to kill
that buzz, Crystal.

12:06.542 --> 12:10.458
Take us back about a year ago,
back when you were in a bad
way.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.333
(Kat)
'You told Joseph Shaw
you loved him'

12:12.417 --> 12:15.625
and if you didn't kill
yourself,
you'd kill him.

12:15.709 --> 12:18.291
Oh, yeah.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.208
(Will)
'Now he's dead,
shot right in the face'

12:20.291 --> 12:22.291
you didn't want
to look at anymore.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.458
Shot by me?
No, you're wrong.

12:24.542 --> 12:25.917
'That so?'

12:27.375 --> 12:31.333
You know how,
if a person is drowning

12:31.417 --> 12:32.875
they'll, like, freak out
and try to drown

12:32.959 --> 12:34.667
the person who's rescuing them?

12:35.500 --> 12:36.709
Sure.

12:36.792 --> 12:39.333
Joseph was the person
who'd rescue you.

12:39.417 --> 12:42.083
Saying that put him
in harm's way?

12:44.208 --> 12:45.667
You gonna say by who?

12:45.750 --> 12:47.417
Oh, but it's so sad.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.875
Crystal.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.959
Joseph's foster brother.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.041
He stopped by one time
and I was like

12:55.125 --> 12:59.417
"Oh, my God, Joseph's family
is as bad as mine."

12:59.500 --> 13:01.166
Which is bad.

13:03.500 --> 13:08.083
Every guy who's
ever
liked me...dies.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.709
'Including Orlando.'

13:11.500 --> 13:12.667
Wilder, what are you
doing here?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.041
- Hey, bro.
- Hi.

13:14.125 --> 13:15.208
Crystal, can you
step out for a minute?

13:15.291 --> 13:17.375
No, no. I'll
be real
quick.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.667
Landlord's screwing
me.
Wants a deposit.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.959
I've given you
my last dime.

13:22.041 --> 13:23.583
I'm gonna leave.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.291
I'm afraid I'm going
to forget who you are.

13:26.375 --> 13:27.709
I'm right here.

13:27.792 --> 13:29.875
I wanna look at you
and see you.

13:29.959 --> 13:31.417
Alright, not this.

13:32.834 --> 13:36.417
Look, I know she made you
feel like you're nothing.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.875
But you're not.

13:38.959 --> 13:40.875
You're not, man.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.750
Joe wants to make everybody
perfect, like him.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.375
No, thanks.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.625
See ya.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.041
Stop!

14:02.125 --> 14:04.333
Get out!

14:10.834 --> 14:14.291
Wilder's mom,
Joseph's foster mom..

14:15.625 --> 14:17.583
...she would, like,
not let them eat

14:17.667 --> 14:20.667
but she'd, like, stuff her face.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.166
Nice way to grow up.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.917
They got into heroin as kids.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.458
Only Joseph kicked it.

14:27.542 --> 14:30.250
Some people
just can't get sober.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.959
You make it look like a breeze.

14:33.041 --> 14:36.333
So Joseph tried the tough love
approach with Wilder.

14:36.417 --> 14:40.000
Who was jonesing and probably
not in control of himself.

14:40.083 --> 14:43.208
And Joseph was dead,
like, two days later.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.792
Your Wilder Dautry's been
rubbing elbows

14:49.875 --> 14:51.417
with the law since he was 14.

14:51.500 --> 14:54.917
Possession, possession,
public urination...lovely.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.959
But arrests drop off
after May 2005.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.458
Yeah, when his foster brother,
Joseph, turns up dead.

15:00.542 --> 15:03.041
- No trace of Wilder since
then?
- 'Nope.'

15:03.125 --> 15:06.375
Got a last known address,
Reba Dautry.

15:06.458 --> 15:07.458
Mother?

15:07.542 --> 15:09.834
And Joseph Shaw's
foster mom.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.959
Kid at the park saw
somebody beat the crap

15:14.041 --> 15:16.625
out of that pervert guy.

15:16.709 --> 15:18.083
Must've gotten what was
coming to him.

15:18.166 --> 15:20.041
That courtesy of you?

15:20.917 --> 15:22.792
Me?

15:22.875 --> 15:24.709
Nah.

15:29.583 --> 15:32.250
(Reba)
'I took in Joseph
when he was 15.'

15:32.333 --> 15:34.166
Nobody else wanted him.

15:34.250 --> 15:37.125
He and Wilder got
thick as thieves.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.125
Turned against me.

15:39.208 --> 15:40.709
How so, Mrs. Dautry?

15:40.792 --> 15:42.333
Called DHS on me.

15:42.417 --> 15:45.041
Hmm, imagine that.

15:45.125 --> 15:49.000
Yeah, that right there.
That's the look he'd give me.

15:49.083 --> 15:51.583
Wilder disappeared right
around when Joseph died.

15:51.667 --> 15:52.625
You know why?

15:52.709 --> 15:54.208
Figured he took off.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.875
'Cause he ran out of people
in Philly to mooch off, of.

15:56.959 --> 15:58.959
And they were seen arguing.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.125
Always something
with those two.

16:01.208 --> 16:02.834
What do you mean?

16:02.917 --> 16:05.041
Well, the last time
I saw them

16:05.125 --> 16:06.667
they were up a creek.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.458
Looking to me to bail them out.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.041
Look, he needs your help.
He's coming down

16:14.125 --> 16:15.875
and he's got no place to stay.

16:15.959 --> 16:18.500
You act like you're
better than him.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.542
I read about that
place you work.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.250
Kids stabbin' each other.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.667
I was threatened
today about that.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.792
I don't want Wilder
near me, it's
dangerous.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.125
Can't stay here.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.417
I got fosters
in all the bedrooms.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.041
I want to get him
out of the city.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.709
To the farm.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.041
That old shack?

16:36.125 --> 16:37.917
Who even knows
where the key is?

16:38.000 --> 16:42.208
Reba, look, I know we
haven't
been family to each other.

16:42.291 --> 16:44.583
But we need
this,
me and him.

16:47.959 --> 16:50.208
You two got enough
out of me.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.125
Wilder.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.875
Joseph will take care of you.
Alright, pumpkin, hmm?

16:57.959 --> 16:59.208
I wanna go to my room.

16:59.291 --> 17:00.917
We've got to go, brother.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.542
Come on, we'll get you
to my place, clean you
up.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.291
You're the Mother
of the Year, Reba.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.083
Thanks for everything.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.792
Sounds like the same award
my mom was up for.

17:18.542 --> 17:20.750
So you sent Joseph packing?

17:20.834 --> 17:23.166
With a strung out
drug addict for company?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.333
Yep.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.834
What was the farm
Joseph asked you about?

17:27.917 --> 17:29.625
Family place.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.500
Up Limekiln Pike.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.917
Just a pile of boards
and nails by now.

17:35.291 --> 17:37.166
Address, Reba.

17:46.041 --> 17:48.125
Might want to get
that hand X-rayed, Scotty.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.458
Uhh, it's nothing.

17:49.542 --> 17:52.792
Just, uh...jammed it
in a pickup game.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.625
(John)
'Heading out, Lil?'

17:55.709 --> 17:59.750
I was thinking I'd go out
to the Dautrys' farm now.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.792
Go in the
morning.
The two of you.

18:02.875 --> 18:06.250
Okay, goodnight, boss.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.709
Goodnight.

19:36.041 --> 19:37.000
Archer?

19:39.583 --> 19:40.917
Laura?

19:47.291 --> 19:48.750
You're alive.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.500
Who the hell are you?

19:59.583 --> 20:01.250
I'm the police.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.542
I'd like some proof of that.

20:11.458 --> 20:13.542
Who was murdered
in your apartment?

20:17.333 --> 20:19.333
My foster brother Wilder.

20:19.417 --> 20:22.125
- Did you kill him?
- Of course not.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.417
Guy was a mess,
but I loved him like hell.

20:26.875 --> 20:29.041
You let everyone
think
it was you.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.583
They thought they'd killed me.

20:31.667 --> 20:34.125
If I came forward,
they'd try again.

20:34.208 --> 20:35.250
They?

20:38.208 --> 20:39.959
What are you doing out here
at night, alone?

20:40.041 --> 20:42.125
Looking for Wilder.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.959
Trying to solve your murder.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.583
I guess I should be grateful.

20:46.667 --> 20:49.417
These are some odd hours.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.250
What are you,
a workaholic, Detective?

20:52.750 --> 20:54.417
Who was trying
to kill you, Joseph?

20:54.500 --> 20:56.083
I spent the last year
trying to find out.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.333
Get proof to police,
have to pay attention to.

20:58.417 --> 21:00.458
You tell me what you know,
I can take it from there.

21:00.542 --> 21:03.834
No, you don't understand.
These people have the resources

21:03.917 --> 21:05.333
and the reach to stop you.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.709
That sounds a little paranoid.

21:08.792 --> 21:10.500
I wish it was.

21:12.625 --> 21:14.792
You have to trust
me,
I-I can help.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.667
What's your name?

21:20.750 --> 21:23.208
Lilly...Rush.

21:23.291 --> 21:24.500
Detective Lilly Rush.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.667
Huh, well, you must think
I'm a wacko.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.625
This-this-this isn't
as Ted Kaczynski as it looks.

21:29.709 --> 21:31.250
It's a..

21:31.333 --> 21:33.875
It's a good life out here.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.125
Quiet.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.417
I could see that.

21:42.625 --> 21:45.125
Does it feel like we've
met before or something?

21:46.667 --> 21:48.000
No.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.917
Tell me what happened, Joseph.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.667
I was at Robinson House the day
before, Wilder, was murdered.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.709
Joseph?
I got to talk to
you.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.458
It's important.

22:07.542 --> 22:10.208
Could we talk
in your office?

22:10.291 --> 22:12.000
So, yeah,
I'll work
on

22:12.083 --> 22:13.709
taking
criticism
better.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.583
Cool.
Thanks, Joseph.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.041
Is everything okay?

22:19.125 --> 22:21.875
I haven't slept in two
months, not since Orlando
died.

22:21.959 --> 22:23.458
- I know.
- Joseph

22:23.542 --> 22:25.583
The kids who need
love
and support the most

22:25.667 --> 22:27.125
we can't just
throw them away.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.917
We don't throw
anyone away, Jane.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.208
- What about Corey?
- Corey?

22:31.291 --> 22:33.750
He needs us
we're his
family

22:33.834 --> 22:38.000
and you testifying, just
slams the door in his
face.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.583
But Corey killed a boy.

22:40.667 --> 22:42.750
He needs to take
responsibility for that.

22:42.834 --> 22:45.125
But Corey had to do it.

22:45.208 --> 22:47.000
Orlando, was going
to ruin everything

22:47.083 --> 22:48.250
and bring down
this place.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.125
Bring it down?
What are you talking about?

22:52.291 --> 22:53.959
It's none of your business.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.458
Well, I don't know
what's going on here

22:58.542 --> 23:01.208
but I'm gonna testify,
Jane, no matter what.

23:01.291 --> 23:03.875
You won't testify,
and that's final.

23:06.542 --> 23:08.333
Next night, there
was
a hole in my door

23:08.417 --> 23:10.000
and, and
Wilder
was dead.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.625
But, you think Jane,
was involved?

23:11.709 --> 23:13.709
I've been following Corey,
see if I could find out
more.

23:13.792 --> 23:16.291
- No that's dangerous, Joseph.
- And I tried, to find Crystal.

23:16.375 --> 23:17.792
See what she knows,
but she's disappeared.

23:17.875 --> 23:19.291
She just got out of jail.

23:19.375 --> 23:22.166
I can talk to her
first thing tomorrow.

23:22.250 --> 23:25.792
Look, you can't
tell anyone, I'm
alive.

23:25.875 --> 23:26.875
I have to bring you in.

23:26.959 --> 23:29.208
I'm not
going
anywhere.

23:29.291 --> 23:32.000
Trust me.

23:33.750 --> 23:36.000
Was that you?

23:36.083 --> 23:37.417
Used your credit card?

23:41.083 --> 23:42.667
Laura got chomped,
by a raccoon

23:42.750 --> 23:46.333
'and I had to rush her to
the vet's, in the city.'

23:46.417 --> 23:47.959
'The card was still
in my wallet.'

23:48.041 --> 23:49.500
I was so upset
about the whole thing.

23:49.583 --> 23:52.208
I just wasn't
thinking straight.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.542
(Rush)
'I get it.'

24:12.875 --> 24:14.500
(Valens on phone)
'Valens.'

24:14.583 --> 24:19.458
Scotty, I'm at the Dautry
Farm,
and there's nothing here.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.041
No point in you driving out.

24:21.125 --> 24:23.291
Wait, you went on your own?

24:23.375 --> 24:26.917
Ah, yeah. I was up early,
just thought I'd swing by.

24:28.250 --> 24:29.291
Okay.

24:29.375 --> 24:31.000
And, listen, can
you tell the boss

24:31.083 --> 24:32.041
I'm gonna take a sick day?

24:32.125 --> 24:33.375
Lil, what's going on?

24:33.458 --> 24:35.083
'Nothing, I'm just, um..'

24:35.166 --> 24:39.500
...gonna take off sick.
Will you tell him?

24:39.583 --> 24:41.041
Yeah. Yeah, alright.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.709
She on her way in?

24:49.792 --> 24:53.208
No. She's, uh,
taking a sick day.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.375
She never takes off sick.

24:55.458 --> 24:58.000
Manager from the check
cashing store called
back.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.542
Has a security video
we can look at

24:59.625 --> 25:02.667
from the night
the card was used.

25:02.750 --> 25:04.458
Lil's sick.

25:04.542 --> 25:06.375
She's never sick.

25:10.875 --> 25:13.709
Ah, Detective,
good to see
you.

25:13.792 --> 25:15.458
So sorry, I'm
afraid
I'm rushing off

25:15.542 --> 25:16.750
to a board
meeting
this morning.

25:16.834 --> 25:18.750
Actually, I'm looking
for your wife.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.417
Uh, well, she's out.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.417
Can I have her call you?

25:21.500 --> 25:22.750
Did you know
she asked Joseph

25:22.834 --> 25:25.291
not to testify
against Corey?

25:25.375 --> 25:27.792
- Where did you hear that?
- Please answer the question.

25:27.875 --> 25:30.041
Well, someone
misunderstood, I'm
sure.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.125
No, she was
pretty clear about it.

25:31.208 --> 25:32.792
I believe the phrase was

25:32.875 --> 25:35.250
"Do not testify against Corey."

25:36.667 --> 25:38.417
If she said
anything like
that

25:38.500 --> 25:40.583
it was in the interest of
protecting Robinson House

25:40.667 --> 25:41.750
and the residents there.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.834
What exactly was she
protecting them from?

25:45.458 --> 25:47.792
I think you're getting in
over your head here,
Detective.

25:48.875 --> 25:51.000
- Really?
- Really.

26:03.458 --> 26:06.000
Crystal?

26:06.083 --> 26:07.917
I'm Detective Rush.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.291
I'm pretty popular with
you guys these days, huh?

26:11.375 --> 26:13.250
I need your help.

26:13.333 --> 26:15.458
You had something you
wanted to tell,
Joseph.

26:15.542 --> 26:18.291
The night
before
he got killed?

26:18.375 --> 26:21.417
Kind of weird you
know about that.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.792
Help a starving
musician, dudes?

26:28.250 --> 26:30.667
That guitar's
got no
strings.

26:32.417 --> 26:33.291
Whatever.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.834
It's the music I care about.

26:38.417 --> 26:40.250
You cared about
Joseph, too.

26:42.542 --> 26:44.834
And if you know something

26:44.917 --> 26:46.959
maybe you could
tell us who hurt him.

26:47.041 --> 26:51.750
But everyone who's ever said
anything about it...is dead.

26:51.834 --> 26:54.709
With your help, we can put
the murderer away for good.

27:03.208 --> 27:05.333
It was the night
before, Orlando got killed.

27:09.333 --> 27:10.667
You want to get a game
of cards or something

27:10.750 --> 27:12.417
before lights out?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.625
Lights out is like right now.

27:14.709 --> 27:16.375
I'm gonna go look for Joseph.

27:16.458 --> 27:19.166
You're making a fool
out of yourself, you know
that?

27:19.250 --> 27:20.667
'You're better than that.'

27:20.750 --> 27:25.208
- Not really.
- Yeah, you are.

27:25.291 --> 27:27.667
Come on, Crys,
come hang with me.

27:27.750 --> 27:30.834
Too much energy
right now, sorry.

27:30.917 --> 27:34.250
Cool. Whatever.
Later.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.417
Corey.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.208
I love you.

28:10.917 --> 28:13.417
Jane and Corey, together?

28:13.500 --> 28:17.083
Totally, creepily, together.

28:21.667 --> 28:25.375
Next day, I told Orlando.

28:25.458 --> 28:27.291
And you think that's
what got him killed?

28:28.333 --> 28:31.041
I know it did.

28:31.125 --> 28:32.959
He said he was gonna
give Corey hell

28:33.041 --> 28:35.291
maybe make some money off it.

28:36.583 --> 28:38.000
Next thing I know

28:39.834 --> 28:41.792
Orlando's dead.

28:50.583 --> 28:51.875
You were right.

28:51.959 --> 28:53.333
I found out what was going on.

28:53.417 --> 28:54.458
And?

28:54.542 --> 28:56.750
I need you to come in.
First thing.

28:56.834 --> 28:59.291
Look, if Corey doesn't
spill,
and I'm out in the open..

28:59.375 --> 29:00.709
(Rush)
'He'll spill.'

29:00.792 --> 29:02.208
I'll make him.

29:02.291 --> 29:04.959
(Rush)
'Will you be there?'

29:05.041 --> 29:06.917
Yeah, I will.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.083
I-I got to go.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.709
Where the hell you been. I
been
trying to call you all day.

29:17.792 --> 29:19.291
Turned my phone off.

29:20.875 --> 29:22.750
You don't look sick.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.125
What's that?

29:27.208 --> 29:29.417
Security video
from the check
place.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.834
Something on here
you should see.

29:34.291 --> 29:36.500
You know what's
on here, don't you?

29:39.959 --> 29:43.250
I went to the farm
last night. He was there.

29:43.333 --> 29:44.792
You lied to me?

29:44.875 --> 29:46.583
Something got into
my head, I-I can't--

29:46.667 --> 29:48.333
What the hell's
going on with
you?

29:48.417 --> 29:54.250
I started...having
feelings...for this guy, I..

29:54.333 --> 29:56.375
Before I even knew
he was alive.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.959
I've gone off
the deep end, right?

30:04.125 --> 30:05.458
You got to
talk
to the boss

30:05.542 --> 30:06.875
tell him
what's going
on.

30:08.917 --> 30:10.875
I know.

30:10.959 --> 30:12.500
I will, first thing.

30:14.250 --> 30:15.375
(Rush)
'But it's not
just the case.'

30:15.458 --> 30:18.709
Scotty, it's...him.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.500
Joseph.

30:22.583 --> 30:24.125
Okay.

30:26.333 --> 30:28.417
Sounds crazy, huh?

30:30.000 --> 30:34.417
I get the messed up
affections thing, believe
me.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.500
Crap.
I screwed up.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.125
So...Hmm.
you alright
here?

30:53.834 --> 30:56.041
Thanks, Scotty.

31:02.333 --> 31:04.333
Now, how's that feeling?

31:07.083 --> 31:08.792
It's killing me.

31:44.667 --> 31:46.750
Corey's sweating in a cell.

31:47.875 --> 31:49.500
(Valens)
'Where's Joseph?'

31:49.583 --> 31:50.834
He's coming.

31:55.375 --> 31:57.208
Rush.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.709
So..

32:19.792 --> 32:21.709
You went out
to the farm
alone.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.291
Yes.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.375
And lied to Scotty

32:25.458 --> 32:27.625
and then went
AWOL all day.

32:29.458 --> 32:31.083
I'm sorry.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.667
But Joseph would've
ditched out if I told you.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.458
You don't cover
for a guy dodging the
law!

32:38.333 --> 32:40.208
(Stillman)
'That's not
how to be a cop.'

32:40.291 --> 32:42.792
And it's certainly not
how to be a homicide
detective.

32:44.041 --> 32:44.959
I know.

32:45.041 --> 32:46.709
And where is he now?

32:46.792 --> 32:48.375
He's..

32:50.792 --> 32:52.583
I don't know.

32:55.250 --> 32:56.959
I don't understand
what you did here.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.500
I don't, either.

33:04.375 --> 33:06.375
You should leave my office.

33:12.792 --> 33:13.959
And, and what?

33:14.041 --> 33:15.417
What's gonna happen?

33:15.500 --> 33:19.166
I don't know.

33:19.250 --> 33:21.500
I don't know that,
this can be fixed.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.125
(Valens)
'I don't think
you get it, Corey.'

33:40.208 --> 33:42.250
It's the end
of the line for you.

33:42.333 --> 33:43.709
(Rush)
'Joseph's alive.'

33:43.792 --> 33:46.583
And he's going to testify
you killed Orlando.

33:46.667 --> 33:49.917
Did Joseph raise
from the dead?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Where is he?

33:52.083 --> 33:53.709
Well, can I see him?

33:53.792 --> 33:55.125
You killed Orlando.

33:55.208 --> 33:57.709
'Cause he knew what was going on
with you and Jane.

33:57.792 --> 33:59.750
You all are crazy!

33:59.834 --> 34:04.333
I'll say it again,
I didn't kill Orlando.

34:04.417 --> 34:08.458
(Joseph)
'You did, Corey.'

34:08.542 --> 34:09.834
I saw you.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.834
You're supposed to be dead, man!

34:13.917 --> 34:14.917
'She told me.'

34:15.000 --> 34:16.208
Who?

34:23.083 --> 34:25.500
Corey, baby, what happened?

34:25.583 --> 34:27.333
You didn't do it, did you?

34:27.417 --> 34:29.458
I did it for you.

34:29.542 --> 34:30.750
What?

34:30.834 --> 34:33.625
Orlando knew about us,
but I got rid of him.

34:33.709 --> 34:35.166
Before he could tell anybody.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.291
Jane, I protected you.

34:39.583 --> 34:41.792
Because I love you.

34:41.875 --> 34:45.917
Don't tell me, that you don't
feel like that, Jane, please.

34:46.041 --> 34:49.834
I just...I just wanted
to comfort you

34:51.208 --> 34:52.875
To, to hold you.

34:52.959 --> 34:55.417
I'm...I'm sorry.

34:58.709 --> 35:00.959
I bet you wouldn't want
people,
talking about how you touch

35:01.041 --> 35:03.834
- The boys at Robinson House.
- What?

35:03.917 --> 35:07.333
Look, I'm not saying
it was like that with us,
Jane

35:07.417 --> 35:09.500
but that's how
people
are going to talk.

35:09.583 --> 35:10.834
Don't say that about me.

35:10.917 --> 35:12.625
Joseph saw me do it.

35:13.875 --> 35:16.667
So you got to shut him up.

35:16.750 --> 35:18.250
(Corey)
'Please.'

35:20.709 --> 35:23.709
Jane Robinson, promised
she'd get rid of Joseph?

35:23.792 --> 35:25.250
But she lied.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.125
I thought she loved me.

35:29.208 --> 35:30.500
Well, she tried
to kill him, man.

35:30.583 --> 35:32.667
That make you feel better?

35:32.750 --> 35:35.166
(Corey)
'She still sends me things.'

35:35.250 --> 35:37.125
Sends me lots of things.

35:43.250 --> 35:44.875
We got this.

36:01.875 --> 36:03.583
So, uh..

36:05.291 --> 36:06.792
Well, this is weird.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.709
I just feel..

36:08.792 --> 36:10.959
- Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah. Huh.

36:11.041 --> 36:14.750
From the moment, I saw you in my
house, holding a gun on me.

36:14.834 --> 36:18.083
- 'Huh. Yeah.'
- Yeah.

36:18.166 --> 36:20.458
- It's, um..
- New?

36:26.166 --> 36:29.375
So where will you go?

36:29.458 --> 36:32.583
Oh...farm for a while.

36:32.667 --> 36:37.709
Should I...keep the door
open,
in case you want to..

36:39.500 --> 36:41.250
...track me down?

36:45.792 --> 36:47.250
Keep it locked.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.792
Alright. Okay.

36:52.875 --> 36:54.667
I can break in
if I need to.

36:59.208 --> 37:01.917
(Lawyer)
'My client has dedicated
her life to Robinson House.'

37:02.000 --> 37:04.500
She has helped countless
teenagers kick addiction.

37:04.583 --> 37:06.500
(Vera)
'And took liberties
with at least one of them.'

37:06.583 --> 37:08.583
This is outrageous.
They can't say that to her.

37:08.667 --> 37:11.000
You promised, Corey.
you'd kill Joseph.

37:11.083 --> 37:13.792
You seriously take
the word of a deluded youth

37:13.875 --> 37:17.250
'over my client's?'

37:17.333 --> 37:18.583
What are these?

37:18.667 --> 37:20.667
What are they doing?

37:20.750 --> 37:22.625
(Jeffries)
'Your letters to Corey.'

37:22.709 --> 37:25.625
'He saved them all.'

37:25.709 --> 37:27.041
(Vera)
"Dear sweet boy.

37:27.125 --> 37:29.583
your letters cannot
come soon enough."

37:29.667 --> 37:32.917
- This one's from last week.
- No.

37:33.041 --> 37:35.667
(Jeffries)
"Dear Corey, the leaves are
falling from the trees.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.667
"and I know
your birthday is coming

37:37.750 --> 37:39.500
The first day of fall."

37:39.583 --> 37:41.750
Writing concerned
letters, is not a crime.

37:41.834 --> 37:43.792
She promised.

37:43.875 --> 37:45.083
She promised what?

37:45.166 --> 37:48.291
It's Tom's birthday
she's talking about.

37:48.375 --> 37:50.667
First day of fall.

37:51.875 --> 37:53.458
Is your wife
having problems?

37:53.542 --> 37:57.291
She's been depressed,
since our son died.

37:57.375 --> 37:58.375
(Vera)
'This is why you killed'

37:58.458 --> 38:00.959
Joseph Shaw?

38:01.041 --> 38:04.750
So you and Corey, could keep
your little romance going?

38:04.834 --> 38:07.166
We couldn't just slam
the door in his face.

38:07.250 --> 38:09.542
So you shot Joseph.

38:09.625 --> 38:11.667
It's hard to picture
your wife hurting
anyone.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.250
She wouldn't, she can't.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.750
Tell us, Jane!

38:15.834 --> 38:18.083
All I ever wanted
was to help him.

38:18.166 --> 38:20.500
Jane, stop. Make them stop!

38:21.709 --> 38:23.709
It wasn't her, was it?

38:23.792 --> 38:25.542
Who took care of Joseph?

38:29.750 --> 38:32.709
We survived the worst
thing
parents can live through.

38:32.792 --> 38:36.834
We were almost whole
again, and then that
kid..

38:38.500 --> 38:40.542
She's all I have
left, Lieutenant.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.625
I would do anything for her.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.583
How could
you do
this?

38:52.834 --> 38:56.625
- You could go to jail. He's
17!
- I want to save him.

38:56.709 --> 38:59.125
'You can't.'

39:00.500 --> 39:03.166
This stops here.

39:03.250 --> 39:05.875
This kid is not our son.

39:05.959 --> 39:08.625
Oh, what about Joseph?

39:08.709 --> 39:10.291
He'll tell.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.709
I'll take care of that.

39:18.792 --> 39:21.333
But you have got
to pull it together.

39:21.417 --> 39:24.667
Starting tomorrow,
no more of this.

39:24.750 --> 39:26.750
No more Corey.

39:29.959 --> 39:30.834
Okay.

39:30.917 --> 39:32.917
No more sleeping all day.

39:34.041 --> 39:36.542
And no more
of this sadness.

39:40.417 --> 39:42.291
We can be happy.

39:43.667 --> 39:46.375
'Cause that's what,
Tom, would want.

39:51.250 --> 39:55.375
I just miss
him,
Teddy. I do.
