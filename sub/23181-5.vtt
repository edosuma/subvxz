some kind of drinking problem?

‐That's alcohol's abuse.

‐Well, to be fair...
‐Oh, don't say "to be fair."

"to be fair."

‐You don't know.
‐What'd I just say?

of an ice cream cone.

Not sure how
I feels about this talk.

What, do you think they check
for bugs down there

00:39.700 --> 00:41.333

Fuck, no.

only gym shorts,

09:48.651 --> 09:50.585
as you can see
in the poster.

09:50.618 --> 09:52.651
And then you'll have all these
dudes work out together?

09:52.685 --> 09:54.685
Yes, and they'll
always be shirtless

09:54.718 --> 09:56.718
‐'cause there's no AC.
‐It's hot.

09:56.751 --> 09:58.985
Then when all these dudes
are done working out together,

09:59.018 --> 10:00.751
they can go swimming together?

10:00.785 --> 10:02.451
Oh, we'll teach them
how to wrestle, too.

10:02.485 --> 10:04.451
Hold downs,
full mount, top control.

10:04.485 --> 10:05.718
Throw some booze in the house.

10:05.751 --> 10:06.351
They can have
a drink together.

10:10.751 --> 10:13.018
What are you really trying
to accomplish here, boys?

10:13.051 --> 10:14.518
KATY: Great presentation.

10:14.551 --> 10:15.551
I really love
the bulletin board

10:15.585 --> 10:16.985
with all the sweaty dudes.

10:17.018 --> 10:18.518
You can just leave that here.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.451
But I don't think that
Uncle Eddie would say,

10:20.485 --> 10:22.985
"Katy, great investment
in sweaty dudes."

10:23.018 --> 10:24.285
And for that reason,

10:25.985 --> 10:27.818
‐I'm out.
‐You want to know what?

10:27.851 --> 10:28.785
I'm just going to
come right out and say it,

10:28.818 --> 10:29.885
and you can take that
bulletin board with you,

10:29.918 --> 10:31.551
please and thanks.

10:31.585 --> 10:33.918
This idea's
a tad fruity‐loops.

10:33.951 --> 10:35.618
And for that reason,

10:35.651 --> 10:36.651
oh, I'm out.

10:38.618 --> 10:40.351
What?

10:40.385 --> 10:41.618
BONNIE: Up next in the barn,

10:41.651 --> 10:43.385
this bartender
turned dog‐breeder

10:43.418 --> 10:46.385
hopes Cupid will find his
way to Letterkenny.

10:46.418 --> 10:47.485
Say, Bonnie,
could I get you anything?

10:47.518 --> 10:49.285
A glass of water, or...

10:50.851 --> 10:52.718
I'm okay, Wayne.
Thanks, though.

10:52.751 --> 10:54.051
Well, if you change your mind,

10:54.085 --> 10:56.618
you can just run to the house
there, help yourself.

10:56.651 --> 10:57.851
Maybe I will run over then.

10:57.885 --> 10:58.951
Can I get you anything?

10:58.985 --> 11:00.018
Well, no, I'm okay.

11:01.751 --> 11:02.685
Do you want anything
from the...

11:02.718 --> 11:04.051
Hmm...

11:04.085 --> 11:05.518
Wet your whistle.

11:05.551 --> 11:06.818
No, I'm good.
I got some water.

11:06.851 --> 11:08.918
Okay. No, we're okay.
Thank you, Bonnie.

11:08.951 --> 11:10.018
Cool, Wayne.

11:12.385 --> 11:15.951
Good afternoon, Wayne, Katy.

11:15.985 --> 11:17.651
WAYNE: Gail, how are you now?

11:17.685 --> 11:20.051
‐Good, and you?
‐Well, not so bad.

11:20.085 --> 11:23.585
I'm asking for five K
for 69% of my company.

11:23.618 --> 11:24.718
Why 69?

11:24.751 --> 11:25.985
Both sides benefit.

11:26.818 --> 11:28.385
Good enough.

11:28.418 --> 11:29.751
I want to give back
to the community

11:29.785 --> 11:32.918
by helping people find love.

11:32.951 --> 11:35.051
Uncle Eddie was
a notorious matchmaker.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.651
And a real fucking legend
on the D floor

11:36.685 --> 11:38.385
‐right up till the bitter end.
‐Yeah.

11:38.418 --> 11:39.718
GAIL: And I plan on doing that

11:39.751 --> 11:41.518
by putting 20 women
from Letterkenny

11:41.551 --> 11:43.318
into a house with you,

11:43.351 --> 11:46.318
and having 'em all compete
for your hand in marriage.

11:46.351 --> 11:47.418
‐Who, me?
‐Yeah.

11:47.451 --> 11:48.751
Well, get after it.

11:48.785 --> 11:50.418
Isn't this already
a reality series?

11:50.451 --> 11:51.818
If it is, no one watches it.

11:51.851 --> 11:53.085
Well, I'd fucking watch it,
boy howdy.

11:53.118 --> 11:55.485
I'll have the girls
perform campy tasks

11:55.518 --> 11:57.818
and complete silly challenges
to prove their mettle.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.551
Well, that sounds fun.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.351
Unnecessary, but go on.

12:01.385 --> 12:03.018
Then you'd go on
group dates with them

12:03.051 --> 12:04.685
and one‐on‐one
dates with them.

12:04.718 --> 12:06.918
And then you ax them
one by one

12:06.951 --> 12:10.485
until you decide which one
you want to marry.

12:10.518 --> 12:11.685
‐Okay.
‐I'm not sure

12:11.718 --> 12:13.051
it's reasonable that
he could choose

12:13.085 --> 12:14.418
a wife based just on that.

12:14.451 --> 12:15.551
I know.

12:15.585 --> 12:18.651
Tastes good, but where's
the cream filling?

12:18.685 --> 12:19.751
Like a Boston cream?

12:19.785 --> 12:21.351
Canadian maple's better.

12:21.385 --> 12:22.451
Well, that's
a Texas‐sized 10‐4.

12:22.485 --> 12:23.785
Here's the kicker.

12:23.818 --> 12:25.818
When it gets down to the final
three girls, deal is,

12:25.851 --> 12:28.551
you get to go to their houses
and meet their families.

12:28.585 --> 12:30.351
See? Now that's reasonable.

12:30.385 --> 12:32.585
And then you get to spend
a night with each of them,

12:32.618 --> 12:34.585
until you decide which one
you want to marry.

12:37.918 --> 12:39.718
Is that... Does she...

12:39.751 --> 12:41.018
‐With all three?
‐Does she mean...

12:41.051 --> 12:42.685
After the...

12:42.718 --> 12:43.985
WAYNE: Well, maybe it means
that I would have to...

12:44.018 --> 12:45.518
I don't want to talk about it,
just ask her.

12:45.551 --> 12:46.951
Okay, I'll ask her.
You want to know what?

12:46.985 --> 12:48.018
I got some fucking
questions here.

12:48.051 --> 12:49.751
Sha‐boink!

12:49.785 --> 12:51.351
Now, when you say I spend
the night with three of them,

12:51.385 --> 12:53.485
is it implied I have sex
with all three of them?

12:53.518 --> 12:55.551
‐Sure is.
‐So, I meet their families.

12:55.585 --> 12:56.951
Then we go have sex.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.385
I do that with three of them,
before deciding which one

12:59.418 --> 13:00.618
‐I want to marry?
‐Yeah.

13:00.651 --> 13:02.518
And do the girls know going
into the process

13:02.551 --> 13:04.685
that I will be having sex
with them and two other girls

13:04.718 --> 13:06.385
before deciding which
one I want to marry?

13:06.418 --> 13:08.618
Yeah. Maybe more.

13:08.651 --> 13:10.718
And do the girls' families,
who I've just met,

13:10.751 --> 13:12.651
also know, going
into the process,

13:12.685 --> 13:14.651
that I will be having sex
with their daughters,

13:14.685 --> 13:16.751
as well as two other girls
who are not their daughters,

13:16.785 --> 13:18.651
before deciding which one
I want to marry?

13:18.685 --> 13:20.051
‐Yeah.
‐And the girls,

13:20.085 --> 13:22.818
and their families, find this
process entirely rational,

13:22.851 --> 13:24.518
despite how self‐harming,

13:24.551 --> 13:26.485
health‐hazardous,
and humiliating

13:26.518 --> 13:28.618
‐it very likely will be?
‐Yeah.

13:28.651 --> 13:30.551
And do you say 20 girls,
and their families

13:30.585 --> 13:32.551
will happily sign up
for this process?

13:32.585 --> 13:33.918
Over and over, I imagine.

13:33.951 --> 13:35.551
Oh, Gail, I don't
want to date a girl like that,

13:35.585 --> 13:37.518
for fuck's sake.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.385
Comes from a family
like that. Fuck...

13:39.418 --> 13:41.851
Gail, could there
be a female version

13:41.885 --> 13:43.485
where there's one girl
and 20 dudes?

13:43.518 --> 13:44.618
‐Yeah.
‐I'm in.

13:44.651 --> 13:45.951
No!

13:45.985 --> 13:46.818
Ew!

13:47.685 --> 13:48.751
You're out.

13:48.785 --> 13:50.018
And do you want to know what?

13:50.051 --> 13:50.918
‐What?
‐I'm out.

13:51.418 --> 13:52.418
Okay.

13:56.047 --> 13:57.714
BONNIE: Up next in the barn,

13:57.747 --> 13:59.747
this husband and wife pair
from RR2 Letterkenny

13:59.781 --> 14:01.214
wants to go hunting
for buried treasure.

14:03.114 --> 14:04.114
Bonnie!

14:05.114 --> 14:06.947
Bonnie!

14:06.981 --> 14:08.247
‐Did ya feed the dog?
‐Yes!

14:08.281 --> 14:09.781
Oh, well, thank you.

14:09.814 --> 14:11.014
Jim Dickins, how are you now?

14:11.047 --> 14:13.114
‐Good, and you?
‐Oh, not so bad.

14:13.147 --> 14:14.481
‐McMurray, how are...
‐Wayne, how are...

14:14.514 --> 14:15.981
‐Well, good...
‐Well, I'm good and...

14:16.014 --> 14:17.747
‐I'm not so...
‐Oh, not so... Uh...

14:17.781 --> 14:19.947
‐Not so bad...
‐Go ahead.

14:19.981 --> 14:21.714
‐You, you were first so...
‐No, why don't you go ahead?

14:21.747 --> 14:23.214
Oh, I didn't want
to be impolite.

14:23.247 --> 14:24.914
Just start talking,
please, McMurray.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.347
So you can go
ahead and start...

14:26.381 --> 14:27.781
If you're going to go first,
then it would be your turn...

14:27.814 --> 14:29.381
Just pretend what I had
to say wasn't important.

14:29.414 --> 14:30.781
You're here to pitch,
are you not?

14:30.814 --> 14:31.847
Are you sure you don't
want to say anything?

14:31.881 --> 14:33.814
Jesus,
Pitter‐Patter, McMurray!

14:33.847 --> 14:35.281
Good enough. Have at 'er.
Yip, yip, yip.

14:35.314 --> 14:37.114
Now, we are asking

14:37.147 --> 14:39.347
for five K for 5%
of our business.

14:39.381 --> 14:40.747
KATY: Okay.

14:40.781 --> 14:42.147
We want to give back
to the community

14:42.181 --> 14:43.481
by helping
them cocksuckers get rich.

14:43.514 --> 14:44.947
Uncle Eddie used to
buy lottery tickets

14:44.981 --> 14:46.447
for the seniors at
the home every week.

14:46.481 --> 14:47.981
MRS. MCMURRAY:
And we want to goddamn do that

14:48.014 --> 14:50.881
by auctioning
off other people's shit.

14:50.914 --> 14:52.047
Bingo.

14:52.081 --> 14:54.281
Did you know

14:54.314 --> 14:55.914
that there are
storage facilities

14:55.947 --> 14:57.747
surrounding Letterkenny

14:57.781 --> 15:00.314
that are filled with other
people's useless

15:00.347 --> 15:02.314
piles of their shit, that they
have forgotten about?

15:02.347 --> 15:03.847
Abandoned it, baby.

15:03.881 --> 15:05.781
‐They abandoned their shit...
‐Abandoned their shit.

15:05.814 --> 15:07.214
Now, whose knob
do I got to polish

15:07.247 --> 15:09.481
to get a cocksucking gin
and tonic around here?

15:09.514 --> 15:11.881
All right. We have secured
the auctioneering right

15:11.914 --> 15:13.414
for these
such storage facilities

15:13.447 --> 15:15.714
with the help of our friend,
Jimmy Dickskin.

15:15.747 --> 15:17.247
‐Dickins.
‐That's exactly what I said.

15:17.281 --> 15:19.814
So, what we want to do is we
want to take people down there

15:19.847 --> 15:21.114
and have them rummage
through all the shit

15:21.147 --> 15:22.381
and then buy some of the stuff

15:22.414 --> 15:24.181
and probably,
more than likely,

15:24.214 --> 15:26.114
most definitely, find hidden
treasures, gold and jewels.

15:26.147 --> 15:27.114
And I'd settle
for a Tom Collins,

15:27.147 --> 15:28.781
if it'll get this rig rolling.

15:28.814 --> 15:30.347
So, you want to sell
other people's shit

15:30.381 --> 15:32.881
that they left in their
storage locker.

15:32.914 --> 15:34.447
‐Abandoned.
‐Abandoned.

15:34.481 --> 15:36.381
‐Things that they abandoned.
‐But it's a storage locker

15:36.414 --> 15:38.014
and nobody's got any good
shit in there.

15:38.047 --> 15:39.114
(CHUCKLES)

15:40.847 --> 15:43.047
You would be surprised.

15:43.081 --> 15:44.347
I'm never surprised.

15:44.381 --> 15:46.814
Well, you will be once we show
you a demonstration

15:46.847 --> 15:48.814
of one such storage locker
that we have brought down

15:48.847 --> 15:50.747
from the tiny town
of Tiverton.

15:50.781 --> 15:52.114
Baby, if you will.

15:52.147 --> 15:53.447
Shall I call you Vanna,
for a little role‐play?

15:53.481 --> 15:54.881
(LAUGHING)

15:54.914 --> 15:56.147
Uh‐huh, baby,
you know what I mean?

15:56.181 --> 15:58.047
All right, and a one,
and a two,

15:58.081 --> 16:00.214
‐and a three, Jimmy Dickskin!
‐Got a beautiful set of DVDs.

16:00.247 --> 16:01.781
‐To start the bidding...
‐DVDs galore, look at that...

16:01.814 --> 16:03.047
‐(AUCTION CHANTING)
‐One, two, three, four, five.

16:03.081 --> 16:05.714
That's $50 guaranteed
for sure for DVDs alone.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.914
Then we got a VCR.
That's a vintage VCR.

16:07.947 --> 16:11.214
Guaranteed $50 for that
sweet piece of machinery

16:11.247 --> 16:13.381
right then and there.
Maybe 100, maybe 150.

16:13.414 --> 16:15.181
No big problem.
What else have we got, baby?

16:15.214 --> 16:16.781
Fishing lures.
What man doesn't want 'em?

16:16.814 --> 16:18.447
What man doesn't need 'em?
What man doesn't throw

16:18.481 --> 16:20.447
fishing lures all over
the goddamn place?

16:20.481 --> 16:22.247
Hundreds by the thousands.
Five dollars a fishing lure

16:22.281 --> 16:24.214
guaranteeing it
for fucking sure.

16:24.247 --> 16:26.747
So, you got five,
probably times 100,

16:26.781 --> 16:28.881
probably $5,000 right there,
sitting alone in that box.

16:28.914 --> 16:30.447
That microwave was probably
touched by Mahatma Gandhi.

16:30.481 --> 16:32.147
Easy! Maybe even Jesus.

16:32.181 --> 16:34.281
The proper thing,
I guarantee ya, is worth

16:34.314 --> 16:36.114
$100,000, no problem.

16:36.147 --> 16:38.147
A bit generous on your
evaluations there, bud.

16:38.181 --> 16:39.114
All right, 100,000
might be too much,

16:39.147 --> 16:41.447
but maybe 50,000.
What have we got now, baby?

16:41.481 --> 16:43.481
Looks like we got a handyman
storage locker, baby.

16:43.514 --> 16:45.114
‐McMURRAY: Handyman storage.

You can do them!
Come in here

17:01.047 --> 17:02.914
and buy all of that paint
and paint your apartment

17:02.947 --> 17:04.347
and give you
$100 cash in your hands.

17:04.381 --> 17:06.347
Ya hear me?
What else we got, baby?

17:06.381 --> 17:08.147
And now we're talking
big money. We got the bits.

17:08.181 --> 17:09.247
We got bits.

17:09.281 --> 17:10.847
Bits coming out of the ass.

17:10.881 --> 17:12.347
Twist bits, drill bits,
fucking Brad bits.

17:12.381 --> 17:14.147
All over the place.
Baby's putting them in...

17:14.181 --> 17:16.014
Gonna have so many bits,
you can put 'em in your tits.

17:16.047 --> 17:17.947
You can put in your mouth,
you can shake 'em all around,

17:17.981 --> 17:19.414
do a little dance,
and all kinds of shit.

17:19.447 --> 17:21.214
Bits all over the place.
You can have so many,

17:21.247 --> 17:23.214
you can lick 'em, suck 'em,
kick 'em fucking right in...

17:23.247 --> 17:24.281
Not for me, though,
but somebody else

17:24.314 --> 17:25.847
who's into that kind of shit.

17:25.881 --> 17:28.347
Each one is guaranteed to be
at least $100.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.181
No problem there, for sure.
$100 each bit!

17:31.214 --> 17:33.347
‐No, they're not.
‐Sure God damn are!

17:33.381 --> 17:34.947
No, they're not.

17:34.981 --> 17:37.047
‐Jimmy Dickskin!
‐Dickins!

17:37.081 --> 17:38.847
I know it's Dickins,
and I meant no offense.

17:38.881 --> 17:40.747
I was just trying to get you
to stop the...

17:40.781 --> 17:42.114
Well, the thing you're doing.

17:42.147 --> 17:43.914
No one keeps shit
in their storage locker

17:43.947 --> 17:45.347
that you can rich off of.

17:45.381 --> 17:47.414
Only shit like Brad
point bits, really.

17:47.447 --> 17:49.081
‐Yep, see.
‐Uncle Eddie would have wanted

17:49.114 --> 17:51.247
me to take this idea and put
it in a storage locker,

17:51.281 --> 17:52.881
then abandon it.

17:53.914 --> 17:55.314
I'm out!

17:55.347 --> 17:57.114
You want to know what? Whoever
called it the Brad point bit

17:57.147 --> 17:58.181
would have done
themselves a favor

17:58.214 --> 17:59.814
by calling it
the Brad Pitt bit.

17:59.847 --> 18:00.881
But either way

18:01.947 --> 18:03.347
I'm out.

18:03.381 --> 18:04.914
That's marketing
genius right there, Wayne,

18:04.947 --> 18:06.114
but you snooze,
you lose, buggers.

18:06.147 --> 18:07.414
You're looking
at three millionaires

18:07.447 --> 18:08.914
walking away from
ya in the dust.

18:08.947 --> 18:10.681
Have a good day!
On the morrow!

18:12.514 --> 18:13.747
BONNIE: Up next in the barn,

18:13.781 --> 18:15.181
this southern evangelist

18:15.214 --> 18:16.114
turned Letterkenny
youth worker

18:16.147 --> 18:18.314
brings the sound of music.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.247
Bonnie, where'd you get
your dress?

18:20.281 --> 18:22.147
I don't know.
It was a Christmas present.

18:22.181 --> 18:23.247
Can you find out?

18:23.281 --> 18:24.714
I think so.

18:24.747 --> 18:26.181
‐It's so cute.
‐Thank you.

18:26.214 --> 18:27.347
You're welcome.

18:27.381 --> 18:28.481
Do you like it, Wayne?

18:28.514 --> 18:30.114
Glen, how're you now?

18:30.147 --> 18:31.814
‐Oh, good and you?
‐Not so bad.

18:31.847 --> 18:33.447
Well, I want your five K.

18:33.481 --> 18:35.114
For what percent?

18:35.147 --> 18:37.281
Uh, at 0%.
That's the Lord's percentage.

18:37.314 --> 18:39.014
‐Oh, is that what it is?
‐Yes.

18:39.047 --> 18:39.981
Now, what I would
like to do,

18:40.014 --> 18:41.747
is to give back
to the community

18:41.781 --> 18:43.447
by spreading the
word of Christ...

18:43.481 --> 18:45.147
‐Okay
‐...through song!

18:45.181 --> 18:47.414
‐Uncle Eddie was an atheist.
‐Well...

18:47.447 --> 18:48.814
Then he couldn't have
been a Boy Scout

18:48.847 --> 18:50.714
because atheism
violates our pledge.

18:50.747 --> 18:52.447
‐You're a Boy Scout?
‐Uh, yeah.

18:52.481 --> 18:53.881
Fastest Boy Scout
to ever earn his badges

18:53.914 --> 18:55.881
in basketing and bugle‐ry.

18:55.914 --> 18:57.481
Hey, ya ever had
a Frozen Girl Scout?

18:57.514 --> 18:59.714
Yes! But with three scoops
of chocolate gelato

18:59.747 --> 19:00.914
instead of ice cream.

19:00.947 --> 19:02.447
I'm proudly
lactose intolerant.

19:02.481 --> 19:03.981
So am I, but you can
power through that

19:04.014 --> 19:05.147
if you really want to.

19:05.181 --> 19:07.047
Wayne!

19:07.081 --> 19:09.347
I'd like to introduce you

19:09.381 --> 19:12.714
to Milo, Levi, and Finn.

19:12.747 --> 19:14.381
Those sound like stage names.

19:14.414 --> 19:17.714
Oh, they are. Their actual
names are Kennedy,

19:17.747 --> 19:19.414
Cullen, Campbell.

19:19.447 --> 19:21.781
‐Those sound like last names.
‐They are.

19:21.814 --> 19:24.781
Now I would like to take these
boys to Los Angeles

19:24.814 --> 19:26.847
to audition for a little show
you might have heard of,

19:26.881 --> 19:28.781
called America's Got Talent.

19:28.814 --> 19:30.281
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

19:30.314 --> 19:32.081
Why can't you just bring 'em
to the local model search

19:32.114 --> 19:33.981
and talent show that's
coming to town soon?

19:34.014 --> 19:36.247
Well, I would prefer
to bring them directly

19:36.281 --> 19:38.214
to the epicenter
of everything.

19:38.247 --> 19:39.714
Make 'em super‐famous

19:39.747 --> 19:41.081
and then inspire loads
of other boys,

19:41.114 --> 19:42.947
all over Letterkenny, to sing.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.481
‐What do ya sing?
‐Oh, we sing Enya.

19:44.514 --> 19:45.814
We sing Enya‐thing.

19:46.747 --> 19:48.281
It's a choir joke.

19:48.314 --> 19:49.947
Anywho, I'm their choirmaster

19:49.981 --> 19:51.781
but I consider myself
to be more of a...

19:51.814 --> 19:53.914
A player‐coach
in the equationatto.

19:53.947 --> 19:55.214
Because, I mean, frankly,

19:55.247 --> 19:57.047
who wants a trio when
you can have a quartet?

19:57.081 --> 19:58.847
‐Tick‐tock.
‐Okay, boys.

19:59.381 --> 20:01.047
Ragazzo!

20:01.081 --> 20:02.381
Grazioso.

20:02.414 --> 20:04.047
Espressivo.

20:04.081 --> 20:05.381
Energetico.

20:05.414 --> 20:06.947
Grandioso!

21:05.081 --> 21:07.281
Well, there was supposed to be

21:08.314 --> 21:09.914
an intermezzo,

21:12.881 --> 21:15.281
but Milo keeps
forcing his falsetto

21:15.314 --> 21:18.081
and not accepting the
fact that he is a castrato.

21:18.114 --> 21:20.114
‐Okay...
‐And Levi

21:20.147 --> 21:21.214
thinks this is madrigals,

‐And then there's Finn.

21:26.381 --> 21:29.247
This is not fucking Glee.

21:31.747 --> 21:35.081
Now the soul of the piece is
obviously in my ostinato,

21:35.114 --> 21:36.981
in my "praise him."

21:37.014 --> 21:38.314
By the time we get
to Los Angeles

21:38.347 --> 21:40.114
the piece will begin
with a sonatina,

21:40.147 --> 21:42.081
it will be accompanied
by a partita.

21:42.114 --> 21:45.447
It will then accelerando
into a capriccio.

21:45.481 --> 21:48.347
I will play my third role
in the equationatto

21:48.381 --> 21:50.914
as the contralto
of the quartet‐o.

21:52.781 --> 21:54.214
So?

21:54.247 --> 21:56.281
Some people prefer a trio.

21:56.314 --> 21:57.981
I am one of those people.

21:58.014 --> 22:01.181
‐And for that reason, I'm out.

Hi, Dan.

22:28.211 --> 22:29.645
‐How are you now?
‐Good, and you?

22:29.678 --> 22:31.478
‐Not so bad.
‐Taking a piss?

22:31.511 --> 22:32.611
Just a fucking pisser, yeah.

22:32.645 --> 22:33.811
Okay.

22:33.845 --> 22:35.078
I yacked from donkey juice.

22:35.111 --> 22:36.911
‐Oh, did ya have a spit?
‐You meat‐sauced.

22:36.945 --> 22:38.678
I was up all night, pretty
near spitting everywhere.

22:38.711 --> 22:40.078
That's pretty near the whole
point of donkey juice.

22:40.111 --> 22:41.545
Like, you know
you're gonna have to spit.

22:41.578 --> 22:43.245
‐Had to call Earl.
‐I called Huey, too.

22:43.278 --> 22:44.678
Yeah, I solds the Buick.

22:44.711 --> 22:45.578
Oh, did you all toss
a sidewalk pizza?

22:45.611 --> 22:46.678
Yep.

22:46.711 --> 22:48.245
‐Yep.
‐Yeah.

22:48.278 --> 22:49.678
Well, that's pretty near
the point of donkey juice.

22:49.711 --> 22:50.145
Like, you know
you'll have a spit.

22:50.945 --> 22:52.911
We are asking for five K

22:52.945 --> 22:55.578
‐for 50% of our business.
‐Fucking serious?

22:55.611 --> 22:56.811
Oh, we sees
everyone else doing it,

22:56.845 --> 22:58.478
figured we'd toss
our hats in the ring.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.545
You can borrow some money
if you want to.

23:00.578 --> 23:02.645
No, we've got enough
to get by, thanks.

23:02.678 --> 23:04.011
Well, we wants to give back
to the community

23:04.045 --> 23:05.645
by getting jobs for peoples.

23:05.678 --> 23:07.545
Well, Uncle Eddie used
to always say...

23:07.578 --> 23:10.245
BOTH: "An idle mind is
the devil's playground."

23:10.278 --> 23:12.578
‐10‐4, good buddy.
‐Over and out.

23:12.611 --> 23:14.811
So Dary and me been
making these duck calls

23:14.845 --> 23:16.211
and we wants to
open up a factory

23:16.245 --> 23:18.878
to manufacture
these duck calls.

23:18.911 --> 23:21.845
Well, see now that
is a great, original idea.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.811
And, uh, see Dan has a beard

23:23.845 --> 23:26.511
and I'll grow a beard,
and then the only people

23:26.545 --> 23:27.645
that we'd have
working in the factory,

23:27.678 --> 23:29.478
would also have beards.

23:29.511 --> 23:32.078
And that would contribute to
our original and unique brand.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.778
Unique and original.

23:34.811 --> 23:35.978
Yeah. And when we're
not making duck calls

23:36.011 --> 23:37.711
to contribute
to our unique brand,

23:37.745 --> 23:39.645
we'd, uh, shoot guns

23:39.678 --> 23:41.878
‐and blows up beaver dams.
‐Oh.

23:41.911 --> 23:43.211
Will the beavers
be out of the dams

23:43.245 --> 23:44.145
before you blow them up?

23:52.111 --> 23:53.578
That's unclear.

23:53.611 --> 23:54.545
But a dam's got to get
blowed up.

23:54.578 --> 23:55.945
I'm surprised we're not
blowing up beaver dams

23:55.978 --> 23:58.078
‐right now.
‐This is a choice idea, boys.

23:58.111 --> 24:01.578
And one that definitely no one
has ever attempted before.

24:01.611 --> 24:03.578
‐I think I'm in.
‐What could go wrong?

24:03.611 --> 24:05.878
And after we grows our brand

24:05.911 --> 24:07.678
and got a followings,

24:07.711 --> 24:10.211
we could use our influences to

24:11.145 --> 24:12.511
condemn homosexuals.

24:12.545 --> 24:13.145
Oh.

24:15.178 --> 24:17.245
No, no, 'cause...
It's okay because,

24:17.278 --> 24:19.778
you know, once we've
created our brand,

24:19.811 --> 24:21.211
and then condemned
the homosexuals,

24:21.245 --> 24:23.078
we'll just like go home
with our families

24:23.111 --> 24:25.211
to eat supper and then
hold hands and pray.

24:25.245 --> 24:26.778
Well, see now,
that's a wee bit

24:26.811 --> 24:28.111
of a curve ball,
super‐chieftains.

24:28.145 --> 24:29.711
What do you have
against homosexuals?

24:29.745 --> 24:31.145
Me? Nothing.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.211
LQBT is all rights with me.

24:33.245 --> 24:34.711
‐Daryl?
‐Yeah.

24:34.745 --> 24:35.745
‐Nothing.
‐So, why do you want

24:35.778 --> 24:37.111
‐to condemn them?
‐Yeah?

24:41.911 --> 24:44.111
We... We seens it
on a TV shows.

24:44.145 --> 24:45.511
‐We know.
‐We know.

24:45.545 --> 24:46.778
We actually seens it
on two TV shows.

24:46.811 --> 24:49.645
One was the TV show,
what we seens it on,

24:49.678 --> 24:52.178
and then the other
was a news program about

24:52.211 --> 24:53.811
what we seens on the TV shows.

24:53.845 --> 24:55.978
BOTH: We know.

24:56.011 --> 24:58.011
But those guys
got real popular

24:58.045 --> 24:59.678
and they looked like they
was having lots of fun

24:59.711 --> 25:02.811
so we just figured if we
dids what they dids...

25:02.845 --> 25:03.545
We could have
lots of fun, too.

25:05.711 --> 25:07.811
Well, do you still want to
blow up beaver dams?

25:07.845 --> 25:09.611
Oh, can we still blows up
the beaver dams?

25:09.645 --> 25:11.178
Oh, yeah, I kind of
thought this whole

25:11.211 --> 25:12.545
conversation was about us
blowing up beaver dams.

25:12.578 --> 25:13.245
I'm surprised
you're not blowing up

25:13.278 --> 25:14.811
beaver dams right now.

25:14.845 --> 25:17.545
This idea has lawsuit
written all over it.

25:17.578 --> 25:18.478
This is the worst
pitch we've seen.

25:19.111 --> 25:20.145
Ever.

25:20.178 --> 25:22.111
And for that reason,

25:22.145 --> 25:24.045
I'm out.

25:24.078 --> 25:26.511
You want to know what, Dary?
You can't even grow a beard.

25:26.545 --> 25:27.711
‐Can too.
‐Cannot.

25:27.745 --> 25:28.845
‐Can too.
‐Cannot.

25:28.878 --> 25:30.545
‐Can too!
‐Cannot! Figure it out!

25:30.578 --> 25:33.611
(SCREAMING) No, can too!

25:33.645 --> 25:35.145
No, you can't.
And for that reason,

25:35.178 --> 25:36.211
I'm out.

25:42.811 --> 25:44.545
But...

25:44.578 --> 25:46.911
Well, what are you
guys doing now?

25:46.945 --> 25:48.678
Me? Nothing.

25:48.711 --> 25:49.845
Do ya want to get hammered?

25:49.878 --> 25:51.078
‐Yeah, I'd get hammered.
‐Yeah.

25:51.111 --> 25:52.178
I think we're
out of beer, though.

25:52.211 --> 25:53.245

ALL: (WHINING) No!

25:54.878 --> 25:56.545
Fuck, do I miss MoDean's.

25:56.578 --> 25:57.745
Well, reason fucking
five million we need

25:57.778 --> 26:00.011
some sort of bar in this town.

26:00.045 --> 26:02.545
What did you say when I told
you that Uncle Eddie died?

26:02.578 --> 26:03.911
‐I say he's a good guy.
‐The other thing?

26:03.945 --> 26:04.711
‐I say he's a real good guy.
‐The other thing.

You're welcome, Wayne.

26:29.578 --> 26:30.778
Save me a dance

26:30.811 --> 26:31.645
Can do.

26:41.611 --> 26:43.678
Hey!

26:43.711 --> 26:46.045
We all know Uncle Eddie
was a real good guy.

‐(MURMURING IN AGREEMENT)
‐Oh, he was a great guy!

26:47.978 --> 26:49.545
‐He was a really good guy!
‐A real good guy.

26:49.578 --> 26:50.511
‐He was a really good guy.
‐Nice guy.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.745
Here's to Uncle Eddie.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.145
And here's to his five K

27:04.278 --> 27:05.478
Whoo.

27:08.145 --> 27:10.845
This is definitely what
