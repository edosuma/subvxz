WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.612
MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:02.636 --> 00:04.105
but no one noticed...

00:04.138 --> 00:05.206
(growling)

00:05.239 --> 00:06.383
until they began attacking,

00:06.407 --> 00:08.141
coordinating,

00:08.176 --> 00:09.177
evolving.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.045
The animals were mutating,

00:11.079 --> 00:12.689
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:12.713 --> 00:13.581
(screaming)

00:13.614 --> 00:16.149
The government came
up with a plan.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.261
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.285 --> 00:19.820
in six to ten years,
the world's animal population

00:19.853 --> 00:22.356
will be thriving once again.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.393
You cannot exterminate
every animal on the planet,

00:25.426 --> 00:27.228
and then re-populate it.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.762
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.796 --> 00:30.564
could be catastrophic,

00:30.598 --> 00:32.409
so a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.835
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.868 --> 00:36.470
animal experts.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.173
Dariela Marzan, Army Ranger.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.741
Jamie Campbell,

00:40.774 --> 00:43.511
a reporter who's been
following this story, found me,

00:43.544 --> 00:46.714
Mitch Morgan,
a veterinary pathologist.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.318
Together,
we're going to find a cure

00:50.351 --> 00:51.419
for the animals.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.654
Time is running out.

00:54.688 --> 00:55.823
Previously on Zoo...

00:55.856 --> 00:57.091
Hold your fire.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.092
Who the hell are you?

00:58.126 --> 00:58.926
My name is Allison Shaw,

00:58.959 --> 01:00.828
I'm the Deputy
Secretary of Defense,

01:00.861 --> 01:03.531
and yes, yes,
I was married to Mitch's father.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.233
When I was saying
good-bye to Chloe,

01:05.266 --> 01:07.601
I started crying black tears.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.213
You're displaying the same
symptomology as Kovacs.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.738
JACKSON: So I'm evolving.

01:10.771 --> 01:14.742
We finally have the means to
stop these animals... TX-14.

01:14.775 --> 01:18.712
Every animal with the
mutation will be destroyed.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.748
General Davies, you cannot

01:20.781 --> 01:22.750
exterminate every
animal on the planet.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.118
It's madness.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.119
I respect that coming from you.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.654
The son of Robert Oz

01:26.687 --> 01:28.856
lecturing me about madness.

01:28.889 --> 01:29.823
I'm glad you're
gonna stay with us.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.568
You want me here to put
a bullet in your head

01:31.592 --> 01:33.794
if you end up like Kovacs.
That's right.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.329
You go sideways,
I won't hesitate.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.598
That's a promise.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.832
Okay? Yeah.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.237
I brought you to Caraquet,
and I'm gonna get you out.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.273
(roaring) Go!

01:45.306 --> 01:47.141
(gunshots)

01:47.175 --> 01:48.742
(growl and groan)

01:48.776 --> 01:50.511

No one's talking about Chloe.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.327
Really not much to say.

03:13.361 --> 03:13.994
She's gone.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.697
No one will tell me how.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.268
Your old pals at Reiden Global.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.301
What?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.904
They weren't prosecuted?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.675
No, and as a matter of fact,

03:27.708 --> 03:30.744
the Noah Objective gave
them a government contract

03:30.778 --> 03:34.815
to develop this splendid
new gas called TX-14,

03:34.848 --> 03:37.518
that will effectively wipe
out all the evil animals...

03:37.551 --> 03:41.355
Oh, and about 2.2
million human beings.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.430
You missed a lot.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.342
Chloe...

04:01.375 --> 04:03.311
Please.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.347
They were gonna
do a demonstration

04:06.380 --> 04:08.916
on a bunch of animals
using the gas,

04:08.949 --> 04:11.885
but Chloe stole it.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.621
Tried to stop them.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.923
She got shot at by a bunch
of General Davies' men.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.757
She managed to make her way

04:17.791 --> 04:20.827
to the room where the gas
was, but the canister cracked,

04:20.861 --> 04:21.995
and gas started leaking out,

04:22.029 --> 04:24.332
and we all would've died, but...

04:25.999 --> 04:26.767
But what?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.970
Dariela.
She, uh, sealed the door.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.540
Trapped the gas inside.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.943
Well...

04:35.976 --> 04:37.978
The gas and Chloe.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.353
So this Dariela
killed my friend?

04:46.887 --> 04:47.888
I don't like it either.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.025
Okay, but she did what
she thought she had to do.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.370
Could I...

05:02.403 --> 05:03.403
What?

05:05.939 --> 05:07.307
Could I be alone?

05:10.478 --> 05:12.045
Yeah.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.048
Uh, yeah, sure.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.864
REPORTER: General Davies
confirms that the Noah Objective

05:30.898 --> 05:32.075
is moving forward
according to plan.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.701
What's The Courier?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.569
Just give me a minute.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.371
You don't have a minute, okay?

05:37.405 --> 05:38.038
We had a deal.

05:38.071 --> 05:38.972
We saved your orchard.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.775
Now tell me what Chloe's
last words meant.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.146
Okay.

05:46.179 --> 05:50.484
Um... a few months ago,
we found something.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.085
At first it sounded like a hoax,

05:52.119 --> 05:54.488
but then Chloe sent in
her report from Patagonia,

05:54.522 --> 05:56.156
and the connection
was undeniable.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.125
Patagonia. Mm-hmm.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.059
And she didn't tell me.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.862
She wanted to; I
advised her against it.

06:01.895 --> 06:05.032
Until we knew more...
about this.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.437
What is "this"?

06:13.073 --> 06:15.743
This is a newspaper called
The Worldwide Courier.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.145
Never heard of it.
Not many people have.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.180
So what about it?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.982
Well, these are a
few of the headlines:

06:22.015 --> 06:23.551
"Blood Rain Decimates Crops."

06:23.584 --> 06:25.118
"Ants Create Lightning."

06:25.152 --> 06:26.720
"Earthquakes Caused by Sloths."

06:26.754 --> 06:27.821
Sound familiar?

06:27.855 --> 06:29.122
Yeah, those are the events

06:29.156 --> 06:31.091
created by the Triple-Helix
animals, so what?

06:31.124 --> 06:32.660
Look at the date.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.636
Is this some sort of joke? No.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.205
These were written in 1895.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.441
Are you saying...

06:47.475 --> 06:50.444
that all of this
has happened before?

06:52.145 --> 06:54.147
♪

07:24.211 --> 07:25.212
All right, we've seen

07:25.245 --> 07:27.515
a lot of weird stuff, but this?

07:27.548 --> 07:28.592
We verified their authenticity.

07:28.616 --> 07:31.251
These articles are very real.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.021
The animals also
did this in 1895?

07:34.054 --> 07:35.894
Only the animals causing
environmental changes,

07:35.923 --> 07:37.958
the Triple-Helix animals.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.593
The same ones we
need for the cure.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.529
We? For the cure, we need

07:41.562 --> 07:43.564
the genomic fossils of
seven specific animals.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.874
If Triple-Helix animals
have been around

07:44.898 --> 07:45.799
over a hundred years,

07:45.833 --> 07:47.635
why are we just
hearing about them now?

07:47.668 --> 07:50.538
The Worldwide Courier was
viewed like a tabloid.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.541
The "I Saw Big Foot
on a Date with Elvis"

07:53.574 --> 07:55.576
of its day; people
thought they were fiction.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.010
Gee, I wonder why.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.647
Bigger problem is,

07:59.680 --> 08:01.148
there's nobody alive
to verify this.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.650
No eyewitness.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.653
These articles tell us nothing.
JACKSON: Actually,

08:05.686 --> 08:07.220
they do show us something.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.556
All right, these articles

08:08.589 --> 08:10.290
they show all the animals so far

08:10.323 --> 08:11.768
that have caused
environmental changes, right?

08:11.792 --> 08:15.763
The sloth,
electric ants, snakes.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.297
You guys have come
across all of that?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.533
Yeah, like I said,
you missed a lot.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.977
JACKSON: Yeah,
but we haven't heard anything

08:21.001 --> 08:22.603
about the jellyfish, right?

08:22.636 --> 08:24.705
Especially jellyfish
that causes hurricanes.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.807
So what we're saying is
that at the very least,

08:26.840 --> 08:31.579
these papers show us what
animal we're looking for next.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.746
Can I ask a dumb question?

08:32.780 --> 08:35.982
How can jellyfish
cause hurricanes?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.626
MITCH: There are no dumb
questions, Lionel,

08:37.650 --> 08:38.552
only dumb people.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.820
It's Logan. Logan.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.324
Jellyfish can effect the
climate by generating heat.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.094
You get enough of them
together, they can,

08:47.127 --> 08:49.029
they can raise the
water temperature,

08:49.062 --> 08:52.700
cause a pretty
powerful surface wind.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.201
I may have found something.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.204
Global radar currently
shows five hurricanes,

08:57.237 --> 08:59.640
one of which hasn't
moved in 48 hours.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.274
Storms aren't stationary.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.876
Looks like we're
heading to Portugal.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.613
MITCH: Hang on a minute.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.614
We might have an eyewitness.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.682
There are a lot of different
species of jellyfish

09:08.716 --> 09:11.084
in the North Atlantic
near Portugal,

09:11.118 --> 09:13.687
one of which is the
Turritopsis dohrnii.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.923
It's also known as the
immortal jellyfish.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.324
As in it lives forever?

09:17.357 --> 09:19.627
It can regenerate its
cells over and over,

09:19.660 --> 09:22.696
so it has the ability to
revert back to adolescence

09:22.730 --> 09:24.297
whenever it's injured.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.166
A chicken going
back into its egg.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.735
So if can find this jellyfish

09:27.768 --> 09:28.912
from 1895,
maybe we can figure out

09:28.936 --> 09:31.672
how it caused these
environmental changes

09:31.705 --> 09:33.206
and figure out how to stop it.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.818
ABRAHAM: I think we're
forgetting something.

09:34.842 --> 09:38.011
Jellyfish have a
very poisonous sting.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.246
And if mass quantities

09:39.279 --> 09:41.014
are causing hurricanes,

09:41.048 --> 09:42.659
it won't be as simple
as just fishing one out.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.952
I may have a way
to help with that.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.688
ALLISON: I'll, uh,
make some calls.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.733
Mitch, would you tell Trotter
to change course to Portugal,

09:49.757 --> 09:51.124
then come see me?

09:51.158 --> 09:52.760
Whatever you say, boss.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.294
Actually, I'm not the boss.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.328
You are.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.200
N-never, not in a million years,

10:00.233 --> 10:01.201
would I ever want that job.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.370
Are you finished?

10:03.403 --> 10:06.006
Look, these people aren't
just my work buddies, okay?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.217
If anything were to ever
happen to them because of me...

10:08.241 --> 10:10.711
With the animals attacking,
anti-venom has become

10:10.744 --> 10:11.988
a huge commodity on
the black market.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.881
You'll run point when we land.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.684
Listen,
I got a good thing going here.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.318
Okay? I work in the lab.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.788
I keep to myself.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.822
I take naps.

10:21.855 --> 10:22.956
Lots of naps.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.091
This is a change.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.727
And we-we both know that you
don't handle change well.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.195
No. And...

10:28.228 --> 10:30.998
in some tautological
Rubik's Cube of logic,

10:31.031 --> 10:33.801
I wish that I could change
my aversion to change,

10:33.834 --> 10:38.672
but that, in and of itself,
would require... change.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.107
You are so much
like your father.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.677
Well, yeah, dear old Dad.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.346
He didn't like to
change anything.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.015
Except wives.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.685
Chloe was smart.
She was tactical.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.619
She was aggressive,
but she's gone.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.197
I have too much to deal
with in Washington,

10:54.221 --> 10:56.757
so I can't be here to Charlie
you angels all the time.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.291
Hence, you, as the primary.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.392
All right.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.194
Fine. Good.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.295
I'll do it. Good.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.396
Can I fire Dariela?

11:03.430 --> 11:04.464
No. No, you cannot fire

11:04.497 --> 11:06.800
the toughest person
on this team.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.903
Now, we need to
discuss Jamie Campbell.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.472
What about her?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.473
Your relationship.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.274
We're friends.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.276
My point is I have
some questions

11:16.309 --> 11:19.346
for this Logan character and your...
work buddy

11:19.379 --> 11:21.414
better not be hiding
anything about him.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.929
Hey.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.132
Nice threads.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.970
I know why we're
going to Portugal.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.037
What about Davies?

11:44.071 --> 11:46.006
Oh, we'll find Davies.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.107
Believe me.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.341
Okay, then what?

11:48.375 --> 11:51.444
What I'm gonna do,
when this is all over,

11:51.478 --> 11:54.514
is I'm gonna find Davies, okay?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.450
I'm gonna lock him in a
room, just him and me,

11:57.484 --> 12:00.320
until only one of us walks out.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.824
And I think we both know
who that's gonna be.

12:03.857 --> 12:04.524
I don't know.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.993
Davies is a badass.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.027
He's a general.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.429
Yeah, and I'm a very ill man...

12:09.462 --> 12:11.799
with nothing left to lose.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.938
We still good on our deal?

12:18.571 --> 12:19.539
Put a bullet in your head

12:19.572 --> 12:21.208
if you turn into a rage machine?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.342
Yeah, we're good.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.012
Good... 'cause I notice that

12:25.045 --> 12:26.355
you and Abe are
getting pretty close.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.215
That's really none
of your business.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.117
Actually, it is, Dariela.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.286
Abe's my best friend,
so if there's anyone

12:33.320 --> 12:36.123
that is gonna stop you from killing
me, it's him.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.227
So, you are gonna
have to make a choice.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.097
If killing you means saving
lives, there's no choice.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.820
TROTTER: I'm gonna need
everyone to buckle up

12:56.844 --> 12:58.011
wherever they can.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.881
Things are about to get nasty.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.119
Hey.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.823
We should be on the ground soon.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.191
Turbulence make you nervous?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.393
Not at all. You?

13:13.426 --> 13:15.829
The only thing on this plane
that makes me nervous is you.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.833
First one's free.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.147
If you've got
something to say...

13:23.536 --> 13:24.872
(grunting)

13:26.940 --> 13:28.942
Enough!

13:31.544 --> 13:34.281
(grunting continues)

13:45.025 --> 13:47.928
I know you're upset,
but never do that again.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.594
What was that with Dariela?

14:21.628 --> 14:23.096
I just wanted her to know

14:23.130 --> 14:24.998
she shouldn't be here
after what she did.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.634
It was pretty hardcore.

14:31.671 --> 14:35.342
Did I mention Mitch is not
at all what I expected?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.077
How so?

14:37.110 --> 14:41.348
Guess I pictured more of a
drummer, less of a lead singer.

14:45.986 --> 14:46.920
You guys were a thing?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.488
No.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.957
I don't know; it's complicated.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.961
Say no more.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.628
I've had my fair share
of complications.

14:55.662 --> 14:56.696
Sure you have.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.031
What's that supposed to mean?

15:00.500 --> 15:03.903
All right, uh, listen up.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.085
The guy who has our jellyfish,

15:09.109 --> 15:10.710
his name is Duncan Santos.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.713
He's the local venom
dealer here in Lisbon,

15:13.746 --> 15:16.249
because God knows every
city needs one of those.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.684
What else do we know about him?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.386
Biochemical genius.

15:19.419 --> 15:23.056
Did some time for producing
a whole bunch of LSD.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.624
He also made a ton of money

15:24.657 --> 15:27.294
developing antivenom,
which was in short supply

15:27.327 --> 15:28.728
after the animals went nuts.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.198
He's a war profiteer
is what he is.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.000
He also did a little
time in a psych ward.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.002
Sipping too much
of his own sauce.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.737
So, we're going after a crazy,
drug-addled venom dealer

15:37.770 --> 15:39.006
in the middle of a hurricane?

15:39.039 --> 15:40.740
Yes, because that is what we do.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.741
Let's get this over with.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.976
Not so fast.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.151
I'm afraid I can't let you
go with the rest of them.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.382
And why is that?

15:49.416 --> 15:50.617
Because I don't know you.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.751
I vouched for him.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.553
At the risk of appearing unkind,

15:53.586 --> 15:54.721
I cannot stress how little

15:54.754 --> 15:56.356
your vouching for
him means to me.

15:56.389 --> 16:00.160
She just needs to ask
him a couple questions.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.428
Oh, you knew about this?

16:01.461 --> 16:02.629
Well, come on, Jamie.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.340
How much do you really
know about this guy?

16:04.364 --> 16:06.199
Um, hello.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.634
This guy's standing right here.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.045
People can learn a
lot about each other

16:09.069 --> 16:10.237
in a short period of time.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.741
I'll be back soon.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.509
ALLISON: Actually, you won't.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.680
I have some questions
for you as well.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.189
(thunder rumbling)

16:34.761 --> 16:37.297
(coughing)

16:38.598 --> 16:41.068
No smoke. I don't smoke.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.239
Come on, come on, come
on, let's go, let's go,

16:46.273 --> 16:48.241
let's get out of here.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.044
Relax, my friend.

16:51.078 --> 16:51.711
It's me.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.446
You Duncan Santos?

16:53.480 --> 16:55.815
Good guess.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.650
(tires screeching)

17:00.520 --> 17:02.189
(car door opens)

17:05.724 --> 17:08.795
Gonna need your weapon, dear.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.196
Really?

17:18.637 --> 17:19.771
Put these on

17:19.806 --> 17:21.141
and get in.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.120
LOGAN: She's not
gonna let me stay.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.088
JAMIE: You didn't
do anything wrong.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.857
I was hired to
steal the leopard.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.392
Yeah, and you didn't.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.793
(scoffs)

17:40.827 --> 17:42.862
In my experience,
people tend to distrust thieves.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.064
Well,
they distrust politicians more.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.305
Listen,

17:52.339 --> 17:54.141
for what it's worth,

17:54.174 --> 17:56.109
I appreciate you going
to bat for me back there.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.847
Nobody's ever done
something like that for me.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.715
Well, honestly I
didn't do it for you.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.852
I fought so hard to get
back to everybody, and...

18:05.885 --> 18:09.822
so much has changed,
it's like I don't even know them.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.091
And they don't know me.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.494
Are you ready?

18:15.828 --> 18:16.796
Yeah.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.231
Not you, her.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.708
Welcome.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.743
(snake hisses) Make
yourselves at home.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.614
(rattling)

18:34.647 --> 18:37.350
(buzzing and chittering)

18:41.654 --> 18:43.190
What is this place?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.424
Well, to make antivenom,

18:44.457 --> 18:47.727
you need lots and lots of...
you know, venom.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.732
There he is.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.635
All 100-plus years of it.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.536
Magnificent, isn't it?

18:56.569 --> 18:57.837
No other species like it

18:57.870 --> 18:59.272
in the animal kingdom.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.909
You know why?
Transdifferentiation.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.811
Cells becoming different
kinds of cells.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.614
Muscle to nerve, egg to sperm...

19:07.647 --> 19:08.615
Well,

19:08.648 --> 19:10.283
look at the brains on this one.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.886
What's your name?
Dr. Mitch Morgan.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.457
Our contact told us that you
were willing to sell him.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.927
No, no, no, no.
I said negotiate, not sell.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.364
Okay, so what do you need?

19:24.397 --> 19:25.465
SANTOS: Good question.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.933
I can only make antivenom

19:26.966 --> 19:28.635
if I have the animal.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.539
And like all things in life...

19:32.572 --> 19:34.741
one of the animals has died.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.909
One of the most valuable ones.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.778
Very sad.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.548
We had a funeral.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.817
I even said a few words.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.320
As eulogies go,
I think it was touching.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.924
I have very little
antivenom left,

19:51.958 --> 19:53.960
and I need to make more.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.828
JACKSON: So,
you want us to get this animal.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.764
SANTOS: (chuckles)
The two of you...

19:57.797 --> 19:59.632
brains galore.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.734
Why us?

20:01.768 --> 20:03.503
Why not just send your own guys?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.772
I did.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.774
But they never came back.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.614
When did you first
encounter Logan?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.416
After I left the compound.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.318
I found him nearly
frozen to death.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.353
You found him, or he found you?
Does it matter?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.255
Very much.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.556
He found me.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.625
And at what point did
he reveal to you that

20:25.658 --> 20:26.802
he was hired to
steal the leopard?

20:26.826 --> 20:29.362
I found some
photographs in his bag.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.597
So if you never found those,

20:30.630 --> 20:32.465
he may have never
told you the truth.

20:32.499 --> 20:35.368
Look, I know where you're going with
this, and you're wrong.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.470
You can't possibly
trust this guy.

20:37.504 --> 20:39.772
I have to assume that you
are smarter than that.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.741
(chuckles)

20:41.774 --> 20:43.343
You don't know a thing about me.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.915
Oh. Jamie Campbell.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.483
Reporter for the L.A. Telegraph.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.319
Fired for defaming Reiden Global

20:52.352 --> 20:54.754
on your blog as "The Girl
with the Genie Tattoo"?

20:54.787 --> 20:57.390
Congratulations on
your ability to Google.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.063
One would assume if you
had any area of expertise,

21:04.096 --> 21:05.932
it would be to find fire
where there is smoke.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.000
Was I skeptical
of Logan at first?

21:08.034 --> 21:09.836
Of course.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.739
But somewhere between him
sharing stories about playing

21:12.772 --> 21:15.742
Moses in his school play
and his onion allergy,

21:15.775 --> 21:16.909
he gained my trust.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.645
He's one of the good ones.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.079
The world is not
and has never been

21:20.112 --> 21:22.048
divided between good
ones and bad ones.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.484
Let me tell you the worst
thing that happened to me

21:24.517 --> 21:25.485
in those woods.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.619
Worse than losing your toe?

21:26.653 --> 21:29.889
I realized it wasn't the
animals I had to be scared of.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.090
It was the people.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.393
There's no telling
what they'll do.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.394
So, yeah,

21:34.427 --> 21:36.663
in this world,
there are two kinds of people.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.565
The animals and the Logans.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.800
I trust him with my life.

21:40.833 --> 21:41.934
More than Mitch?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.805
We done here? Yeah.

21:45.838 --> 21:46.839
Good talk.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.446
ABRAHAM: Just how
many do we need?

21:53.480 --> 21:54.747
As many as we can get.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.849
How do we even know
we'll find any?

21:58.785 --> 22:02.489
Oh, I think that there's
more than a few spiders here.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.941
DARIELA: So if these
things are so dangerous,

22:21.974 --> 22:23.151
why can't we just
inject ourselves

22:23.175 --> 22:25.111
with the anti-venom now?

22:25.144 --> 22:26.946
Doesn't work like that.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.123
Without the venom in your system

22:28.147 --> 22:29.482
to interact with,

22:29.516 --> 22:31.384
the anti-venom will
just dissipate.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.785
Got to use it within 60 seconds

22:32.819 --> 22:33.553
of getting bit.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.422
Yeah,
we heard you the first time.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.557
Paralysis, breathing problems.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.459
Basically, all horrible things.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.828
Good news is,
the Wandering Spider venom has a...

22:41.861 --> 22:43.696
certain side effect.

22:43.730 --> 22:47.600
What kind of side effect?

22:47.634 --> 22:48.901
Six-hour erection.

22:48.935 --> 22:49.669
Hmm.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.703
Fun.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.004
Boy jokes aside,

22:52.038 --> 22:54.073
how can there be this
many webs and no spiders?

22:54.106 --> 22:55.908
JACKSON: Oh, there's spiders.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.110
We just need to know
where to find them.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.513
See these webs...
are easy to see,

23:00.547 --> 23:01.814
'cause they're thick and old.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.916
We need to find the
thin, transparent ones,

23:03.950 --> 23:05.151
that are more recent.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.987
DARIELA: All the webs
look the same to me.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.155
And there's a lot.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.690
ABRAHAM: She's right.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.659
We could be here
for quite some time.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.694
Hey, I'm going to say
something a leader would.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.895
Let's split up.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.030
Okay.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.099
Dariela and I will go this way.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.601
Great,
we'll take the food court.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.803
Hopefully, there's a Pinkberry.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.005
(spider chittering)

23:27.039 --> 23:29.141
ALLISON: Robbery, theft,

23:29.175 --> 23:31.911
possession of stolen goods.

23:31.944 --> 23:35.081
And now suddenly you want
to help save the world?

23:35.114 --> 23:37.183
Yeah. (chuckles)

23:37.216 --> 23:40.887
Right now, that's all that
I've done with my life.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.965
Maybe there's still time
for me to do something else.

23:42.989 --> 23:46.158
Is that so wrong?
It's not wrong at all, my question is why?

23:46.192 --> 23:49.095
I guess you could say
that I was inspired.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.974
It was pretty gnarly out
there in those woods.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.100
I heard. That woman in Caraquet.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.101
Gwen.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.936
Intel from the search
and recovery team said

23:56.969 --> 23:58.204
that they found her.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.841
In pieces.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.577
You know what happened?

24:04.611 --> 24:05.978
No.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.147
Guess you and Jamie
just got lucky.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.650
No.

24:10.683 --> 24:11.818
It wasn't luck.

24:11.851 --> 24:15.254
I was ready to give
up several times.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.123
But Jamie wouldn't let me.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.125
How long have you
been in love with her?

24:19.158 --> 24:21.193
(both chuckling)

24:22.228 --> 24:24.130
I never said that. It's okay.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.966
People have tried to be
heroes for worse reasons.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.238
Am I staying or going?

24:33.105 --> 24:35.608
DARIELA: Something on your mind?

24:35.642 --> 24:37.109
ABRAHAM: Your fight with Jamie.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.679
She came at me.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.181
She's been through a lot.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.182
Instead of fighting,

24:43.215 --> 24:44.250
you might try helping.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.718
We've all been through a lot.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.798
What do you think about her
pal, Logan?

24:49.822 --> 24:52.825
I don't think I trust him.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.260
Or Shaw, for that matter.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.293
Or me?

24:57.096 --> 24:58.665
Dariela...

25:01.233 --> 25:03.570
What do you want me to say?

25:03.603 --> 25:05.171
After what happened with Chloe,

25:05.204 --> 25:07.740
I want you to admit that
you don't trust my judgment.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.181
Say something.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.750
Don't move.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.652
There's one above your head.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.255
(chittering)

25:23.289 --> 25:25.124
There's a lot more than one.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.793
(chittering)

25:40.339 --> 25:41.774
You've got to be kidding me.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.253
MITCH: At least now
we can tell Santos

25:45.277 --> 25:47.546
we found some of his men.

25:49.281 --> 25:53.019
This poor guy didn't even have a
chance to inject the antivenom.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.687
The spiders must've
come quickly.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.260
Um... Jackson?

26:01.293 --> 26:03.195
Little help here.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.366
Don't move.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.367
Stay still. No kidding.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.070
Give me the bag. Come on.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.172
Okay.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.707
Can we hurry this up?

26:14.741 --> 26:18.077
I know.
I'm moving as fast as I can.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.149
It's all right. It's all right.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.654
It's okay, Mitch.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.522
(rattling)

26:30.556 --> 26:33.793
We got a problem.
Yeah, I just need a few more, okay?

26:37.096 --> 26:37.897
They supposed to
move that quick?

26:37.930 --> 26:39.207
Can you not ask
questions right now?

26:39.231 --> 26:40.833
Almost done.

26:40.867 --> 26:41.910
Really should've taken you up

26:41.934 --> 26:43.636
on your offer to
do this yourself.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.313
(chittering) Not all of us
have a handy little mutation

26:45.337 --> 26:46.973
that makes animals ignore us.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.609
Almost there, Mitch.
Let me just get a couple more.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.148
(yells, grunts)

26:56.182 --> 26:58.818
You bit?
No, I just felt like saying "Aah."

27:05.257 --> 27:06.392
Come on, let's go.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.065
Well, you're the animal expert.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.034
I'm just going to get it down.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.444
You want to hurry?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.714
Fast movements will startle it.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.381
Cause it...

27:29.415 --> 27:31.383
to bite.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.725
Great.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.259
Can we get out of here now?

27:58.077 --> 28:00.012
(softly): Come on.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.680
This wasn't so hard.

28:02.749 --> 28:05.351
DARIELA: You had to say that.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.719
Let's go.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.056
(groans)

28:15.327 --> 28:16.695
No, no!

28:17.396 --> 28:19.465
(grunts softly)

28:21.067 --> 28:21.533
(groans)

28:21.567 --> 28:23.335
(Abraham whimpers)

28:23.369 --> 28:24.937
(chittering)

28:28.507 --> 28:29.809
(grunting)

28:35.081 --> 28:36.415
(coughing, wheezing)

28:38.484 --> 28:41.153
(chittering)

28:41.187 --> 28:42.121
Abe!

28:42.154 --> 28:43.756
(grunting)

28:49.962 --> 28:51.063
Come on.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.099
I got it.

28:53.132 --> 28:53.833
(Abe panting)

28:53.866 --> 28:55.367
Okay. (Grunts)

28:55.401 --> 28:56.903
Okay.

28:56.936 --> 28:57.804
Okay, Abe.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.005
Come on. Okay.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.073
(groans)

29:03.042 --> 29:04.110
You get them?

29:04.143 --> 29:05.144
We got a bunch.

29:05.177 --> 29:08.014
Let's hope Santos keeps
up his end of the bargain.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.250
(chittering)

29:17.356 --> 29:19.959
(speaking Portuguese)

29:19.992 --> 29:22.328
I honestly didn't think
I'd ever see you all again.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.132
Is that what I think it is?

29:27.900 --> 29:28.868
Yup.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.141
We held up our end of the deal,

29:30.169 --> 29:33.105
so...
we'll take the jellyfish now.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.808
You guys are good.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.309
Lot of talent in this room.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.278
I'd offer you a job, but...

29:39.311 --> 29:42.181
you seem to be in
great demand already.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.374
What the hell does that mean?

29:47.353 --> 29:49.188
Who's Portuguese Steven Seagal?

29:49.221 --> 29:51.891
General Davies
sends his regards.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.062
You're Jackson Oz?

29:57.563 --> 29:59.498
No, I am.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.969
No, that would be me.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.872
Actually, it's me.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.506
Yeah.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.308
Yeah, I'm Jackson Oz.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.844
How did Davies
know we were here?

30:13.545 --> 30:15.547
(thunder rumbling)

30:21.220 --> 30:23.022
More questions?

30:23.055 --> 30:24.190
No, your stories check out.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.057
Well, that's swell.

30:25.091 --> 30:28.160
While you were busy
waterboarding Logan,

30:28.194 --> 30:30.162
I was checking out your story.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.131
My story?

30:32.164 --> 30:33.541
This is an internal memo
you wrote to the president

30:33.565 --> 30:35.902
two months ago,
in which you support

30:35.935 --> 30:38.637
bringing Reiden onboard
the Noah Objective.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.372
How'd you find that?

30:40.406 --> 30:42.274
"The Girl With The
Genie Tattoo," remember?

30:42.308 --> 30:45.144
It was before I knew
the damage they'd cause.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.879
I made a mistake.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.147
I've more than corrected it.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.450
Yeah, you're not sure
that you can trust us?

30:51.483 --> 30:54.620
We're not sure we can trust you.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.328
You have my spiders?

31:02.361 --> 31:03.495
You sold us out.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.264
Not me. (spiders chittering)

31:05.297 --> 31:07.166
Check your own backyard.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.613
Thanks for this, by the way.

31:21.647 --> 31:24.150
Good work. I mean it.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.184
(unzips bag)

31:31.023 --> 31:32.224
Where are they?

31:32.258 --> 31:35.361
Well, we kind of figured you
wouldn't give us the jellyfish.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.933
(screaming)

31:45.637 --> 31:46.372
(grunts)

31:46.405 --> 31:48.140
(grunting)

31:51.243 --> 31:52.578
(grunting continues)

31:55.247 --> 31:57.249
What are you doing? Antivenom.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.627
Thinking these might come in handy.
We don't have time for this.

31:59.651 --> 32:00.486
Yes, we do, okay?

32:00.519 --> 32:02.288
We got to get going.
Okay, okay, okay.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.556
(grunts)

32:04.590 --> 32:06.225
All right.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.393
Cute trick with the spiders.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.198
(grunting)

32:12.231 --> 32:14.400
Get the jellyfish! Get it!

32:18.337 --> 32:19.471
(grunting, clattering)

32:38.424 --> 32:39.658
Jackson, stop!

32:42.028 --> 32:43.195
(gun clicks)

32:43.229 --> 32:44.997
Dariela... Out of the way!

32:45.031 --> 32:46.032
No, lower your weapon!

32:48.767 --> 32:50.202
ABRAHAM: Jackson!

32:55.574 --> 32:56.442
(grunting)

32:56.475 --> 32:57.476
Abe, move!

33:00.212 --> 33:01.580
Jackson!

33:09.621 --> 33:11.423
It's okay. It's okay, Abe.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.292
I want him alive.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.362
He's gonna deliver
a message for me.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.231
You tell Davies

33:19.265 --> 33:21.033
that I'm coming for him.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.054
I can't get over this place.

33:43.422 --> 33:46.325
Beats the hell out of those
hotel bars from last year.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.494
Yeah, well, I don't know.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.130
We had some pretty good
times in those bars.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.480
Much as I hate saying it,
she's really not all that bad.

34:10.349 --> 34:11.650
She made a tough call.

34:11.683 --> 34:12.851
She hides it well,

34:12.884 --> 34:14.353
but I know it's
eating her up inside.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.655
So you're saying, what,
that I should forgive her?

34:16.688 --> 34:18.456
I'm saying

34:18.489 --> 34:20.359
that she was the only one there.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.629
None of us knows what we
would've done in that moment.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.275
Do you have a minute?

34:44.483 --> 34:45.851
What happened back there?

34:45.884 --> 34:48.887
Jackson was gonna kill that guy.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.422
And your first instinct

34:50.456 --> 34:51.565
was to aim your weapon at him?

34:51.590 --> 34:53.359
I wasn't going to shoot.

34:53.391 --> 34:54.426
Yes, you were.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.328
Listen to me.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.130
Jackson is not like Kovacs.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.132
Jackson is not an animal.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.168
Yet.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.205
If that's the way you think,

35:06.238 --> 35:07.349
then perhaps maybe you should...

35:07.373 --> 35:08.474
Leave?

35:10.842 --> 35:13.479
Back at the stadium,

35:13.512 --> 35:16.815
you said you didn't think
I trusted your judgment.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.350
You were right.

35:18.384 --> 35:20.452
I wanted to trust you,

35:20.486 --> 35:23.121
but you pointed your
gun at my friend.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.159
I don't know what else
you want me to say.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.202
Nothing.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.404
There's nothing more to say.

35:47.379 --> 35:48.514
He's cute, huh?

35:48.547 --> 35:50.216
Named him Moe.

35:50.249 --> 35:53.185
After your grandfather.

35:53.219 --> 35:56.555
So what does, uh, Moe tell us?

35:56.588 --> 35:58.190
A lot, actually.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.859
Much like his namesake,
he's got quite a story to tell.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.829
First thing I noticed
in his cell sample:

36:03.862 --> 36:05.697
radiation, lots of it.

36:05.731 --> 36:08.467
Okay, and how does that help us?

36:08.500 --> 36:10.536
Radioactive dating.

36:10.569 --> 36:14.240
We can pinpoint the exact year
he was exposed to radiation.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.442
Let me guess, 1895?

36:16.475 --> 36:19.311
The same year as our
Courier articles.

36:19.345 --> 36:20.512
That can't be a coincidence.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.248
The radiation exposure,

36:22.281 --> 36:23.949
environmental events, all of it.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.551
You think that
they're all connected?

36:25.584 --> 36:27.919
Look around.
Anything's possible.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.488
Speaking of anything
being possible,

36:29.521 --> 36:30.922
Logan Jones checks out.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.925
He has a shady past,
but he just wants to help.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.527
You sure about that?

36:35.561 --> 36:37.405
Because he really seems
like he's trying too hard.

36:37.429 --> 36:38.364
Maybe.

36:38.397 --> 36:40.466
But I think that we
have a bigger problem.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.569
I know.

36:43.602 --> 36:44.602
Jamie.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.584
We need to talk.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.018
I'm fine.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.588
I'm not a fool, rafiki.

37:02.621 --> 37:06.024
I saw the look in your eyes
when Dariela drew on you.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.360
It was a look of the
man ready to die.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.300
Yeah.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.501
I know.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.272
You gotta know something, Abe.

37:21.807 --> 37:22.874
That wasn't me.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.477
You think I don't know that?

37:25.511 --> 37:27.413
Let me tell you something.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.581
You may be ready to die,

37:29.615 --> 37:34.820
but I am not ready
to let that happen.

37:34.853 --> 37:37.523
And you know what a stubborn
son of a bitch I can be.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.760
Boss, can I speak to you please?

37:41.793 --> 37:43.962
God, don't call me that.

37:43.995 --> 37:46.031
Look, I know the plan
is to drop me off

37:46.064 --> 37:47.442
when we get back to the
States, but...

37:47.466 --> 37:49.034
You want to stay. Yes,

37:49.067 --> 37:51.703
and Shaw said that I should talk
to you about sticking around.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.472
I mean, I want to
help, if you'll let me.

37:56.842 --> 37:59.878
So... Jamie.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.314
She really trusts you.

38:02.348 --> 38:04.416
Yeah.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.851
We went through a lot out there.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.085
Had each others' backs?

38:07.118 --> 38:09.355
She had my back a lot
more than I had hers.

38:11.089 --> 38:13.392
(sighs)

38:16.528 --> 38:18.797
Well, maybe this is your
chance to pay her back, huh?

38:21.367 --> 38:22.367
Thank you.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.977
Hey.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.585
You can't still be mad then.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.788
I mean,
you're the one who hit me first.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.624
Besides, I come in peace.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.762
Put it in your shoe.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.564
It'll help with
weight distribution.

38:52.598 --> 38:53.832
Balance.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.936
Thanks.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.638
Army Ranger trick?

38:59.671 --> 39:01.673
Catholic school.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.944
Florence O'Shea.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.112
Lawn mower accident.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.114
Kids used to call
her "No-Toe-Flo."

39:09.147 --> 39:11.349
(chuckles)

39:13.184 --> 39:16.388
Look, I know we got
off on the wrong foot.

39:17.656 --> 39:18.657
So to speak.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.794
But I hope you can understand
I'm part of the team.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.606
You don't have to like me,
but you do have to know

39:24.630 --> 39:25.597
you can trust me.

39:25.631 --> 39:30.168
Yeah, well...

39:30.201 --> 39:33.405
you can trust me, too.

39:33.439 --> 39:34.706
I'm loyal to a fault.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.808
Yeah,
I saw you stood up for Logan.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.610
He's good people.

39:38.644 --> 39:39.645
He seems like it.

39:39.678 --> 39:43.148
And I think it'll benefit
you if he sticks around.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.050
It helps to have someone
who's been through

39:45.083 --> 39:46.117
what you've been through.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.491
Catholic school again?

39:52.524 --> 39:55.861
No, that was Army Rangers.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.162
Oorah.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.631
That's Marines.

39:59.665 --> 40:02.033
But I appreciate the thought.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.159
You wanted to see me?

40:28.193 --> 40:32.063
I think I know how this gas is
gonna kill 2.2 million people.

40:33.532 --> 40:37.102
What, the, uh,
jellyfish tell you that?

40:37.135 --> 40:39.170
His name is Moe.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.473
And yes.

40:41.507 --> 40:44.242
Okay, Moe has a
Triple-Helix, just like you.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.244
Well, we knew that, right?
Right.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.480
But what we didn't
know is what caused it.

40:48.514 --> 40:52.250
Thanks to Moe getting blasted
by radiation, now we do.

40:52.283 --> 40:55.487
I'm sensing a Mitch
Morgan theory coming on.

40:55.521 --> 40:58.490
Lucky for you, Mitch Morgan's
theories are usually right.

40:58.524 --> 41:00.559
I think radiation
mutated one of his genes,

41:00.592 --> 41:02.694
causing it to sprout
a Triple-Helix.

41:02.728 --> 41:04.563
Well, that's good news, right?

41:04.596 --> 41:08.567
I mean, genes can be
changed, so...

41:08.600 --> 41:10.836
now you know what you
need to do to fix it.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.638
Well, sort of.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.973
The problem is I
can't find the gene.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.842
What do you mean you
can't find the gene?

41:16.875 --> 41:18.644
It's not a set of car keys.

41:18.677 --> 41:19.978
How do you even know it exists?

41:20.011 --> 41:22.247
Where there's a plant,
there's a seed, right?

41:22.280 --> 41:23.658
And you, my friend,
are a pretty messed-up plant,

41:23.682 --> 41:25.751
that means some
place inside of you

41:25.784 --> 41:26.828
is a pretty messed-up gene.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.854
Although I can't see it,

41:28.887 --> 41:32.123
I can sense it,
I know it's there.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.959
I'm calling it the "ghost gene."

41:35.727 --> 41:38.296
It's a little melodramatic,
don't you think?

41:38.329 --> 41:40.599
When you have your own
scientific breakthrough,

41:40.632 --> 41:42.601
you feel free to call
it what you want.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.272
All right, so this gas

41:47.305 --> 41:49.608
must target this ghost
gene, is that right?

41:50.609 --> 41:52.077
Well, how could Davies

41:52.110 --> 41:54.179
create a gas that targets a gene

41:54.212 --> 41:55.313
that you can't even find?

41:55.346 --> 41:56.815
Excellent question...

41:56.848 --> 41:58.283
that I don't have
a theory about.

41:58.316 --> 42:02.921
I mean, the guy's smart,
but he's not playing on this level.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.032
Yeah, he'd have to have
somebody even smarter than me

42:05.056 --> 42:06.257
to figure it out.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.595
Who the hell does he
have working for him?

42:13.732 --> 42:15.000
Open it.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.769
(beeps, lock buzzes)

42:17.803 --> 42:19.237
General Davies.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.310
Things in Lisbon
didn't really work out.

42:25.343 --> 42:27.813
We weren't able to get Jackson.

42:27.846 --> 42:28.914
Then we have a problem.

42:28.947 --> 42:30.649
No, y have a problem.

42:30.682 --> 42:31.983
I've waited long enough.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.285
The TX-14 gas was
working perfectly,

42:34.319 --> 42:35.987
till you sabotaged it.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.355
Now, I'm done with your demands.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.423
You fix the gas,

42:38.456 --> 42:41.059
or I'll make sure you never
walk out of this cell.

42:44.295 --> 42:46.832
I think I've made myself clear.

42:46.865 --> 42:49.567
I'm not telling you
anything until I see my son.
