05:39.976 --> 05:41.568

05:41.644 --> 05:43.612

We all know where that got our boys.

05:46.583 --> 05:48.574
- Peter, not now.

05:48.651 --> 05:50.619

05:51.187 --> 05:52.620

05:52.689 --> 05:56.022
You guys, you sit around,
you have your gourmet meals,

05:56.092 --> 05:58.287
and you pretend
like there磗 nothing wrong.

05:58.394 --> 06:00.828
But you never talk about
Steven and Nico.

06:00.864 --> 06:03.799
- Emma!
- [man] She磗 right.

06:05.335 --> 06:07.269
We磛e always avoided the subject.

06:45.141 --> 06:46.836
[man] Then why do you behave like one?

06:46.910 --> 06:49.435
An adult would磛e shown some sympathy
and kindness towards your mother

06:49.512 --> 06:51.946
instead of worrying about herself
the whole time.

06:52.015 --> 06:55.507

12:13.369 --> 12:15.098
We磛e gotta delete that!

12:16.005 --> 12:17.165
No.

12:19.842 --> 12:21.867
Not destroying it
keeps us on the same team.

12:23.713 --> 12:25.704
Dude, l would never do anything.

12:27.283 --> 12:30.878
l would never do anything like that,
Nico. Come on.

12:49.739 --> 12:52.640
[Ross] You know,
maybe she磗 right. Emma.

12:52.708 --> 12:56.940
- Maybe we should all talk about it.
- What is there to discuss?

12:58.281 --> 13:01.614
You talked to the police. Someone
killed them. They were murdered.

13:01.684 --> 13:04.619
- Well, we don磘 know that for sure.
- Watch the damn video.

13:04.687 --> 13:07.815
Guys, guys... look Ross is right.

13:07.890 --> 13:10.586
Who knows what that video means.

13:10.660 --> 13:14.653
- The cops couldn磘 even figure it out.
- Could we... not talk about it, please?

13:14.730 --> 13:16.789
Could we just remember them
the way they were?

13:16.866 --> 13:19.596
Not the way they were killed?

13:19.669 --> 13:21.796
Did Nico give any indication
that he was gonna leave?

13:23.773 --> 13:26.367
He never...
he never really talked about it.

13:26.442 --> 13:29.172
He磀 just started dating Emma.

13:29.245 --> 13:32.180
He was happy. l mean...

13:33.783 --> 13:35.307
And then he just sort of...

13:37.019 --> 13:38.509
Went cold?

13:51.867 --> 13:54.199
l just don磘 understand why he left.

13:56.305 --> 13:57.772
He had everything.

14:00.543 --> 14:05.242
A great family... Shit, he had
the whole fucking world on a string.

14:06.248 --> 14:07.977
Why would he just run off?

14:10.987 --> 14:12.215
Why?

14:15.625 --> 14:17.183
[sniffs, moans]

14:19.996 --> 14:23.591
l mean, did Emma say something to him,
or did she break up with him?

14:29.271 --> 14:31.239
Oh, Emma, l didn磘 mean to suggest...

14:39.849 --> 14:42.511
Good job, honey. Outstanding.

14:43.386 --> 14:45.411
lt was just a question.

15:02.471 --> 15:04.200
[Nico] Who the fuck are you
and what do you want?!

15:04.273 --> 15:05.433
[Pinhead] The box.

15:05.508 --> 15:06.907
You opened it.

15:06.976 --> 15:10.605
Summoned us. And we came.

15:28.998 --> 15:30.192
[screaming]

15:34.670 --> 15:36.001
[Emma screams]

15:37.039 --> 15:38.131
Guys, it磗 Steven!

15:39.709 --> 15:44.305
- Dad, Dad!
- Peter, give me a hand!

15:45.047 --> 15:46.139
- Emma?
- Yeah?

15:46.215 --> 15:47.477
- Go call 91 1 .
- OK.

15:47.550 --> 15:51.509
Oh, God! Steven, where磗 Nico?!

15:51.587 --> 15:53.248
ls he out there?

15:54.423 --> 15:55.412
Nico?

16:00.229 --> 16:02.663
Are you out here? Nico?

16:05.701 --> 16:07.692
l don磘 think he磗 hurt.

16:08.270 --> 16:09.999
Come on, bro.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.567
l don磘 think this is his blood.

16:15.211 --> 16:18.339
- Are they on the way?
- No, phone磗 not working, line磗 dead.

16:18.414 --> 16:19.676
Shit.

16:21.150 --> 16:22.412
- Try my cell?
- [man] No signal.

16:22.485 --> 16:24.248
That磗 why we keep a landline.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.584
- [woman] Neighbors, maybe?
- Four miles.

16:26.655 --> 16:29.783
- l磎 gonna have to drive him.
- Let磗 use my car. l磍l get it started.

16:38.501 --> 16:41.334
lt磗 all right, Steven.
Save your energy.

16:41.403 --> 16:43.701
[grunting, sputtering]

16:43.773 --> 16:47.300
Don磘... let them... find me.

16:48.377 --> 16:50.345
l won磘 go back.

16:50.412 --> 16:53.609
- l can磘 go back.
- Steven, it磗 OK. You磖e safe now.

16:53.682 --> 16:56.446
- You磖e safe now.
- Where磗 my son?!

16:56.519 --> 16:58.453
Where is he? ls he with you?

16:58.954 --> 17:00.512
Emma...

17:07.163 --> 17:10.064
They磖e gone. The cars are gone.

17:10.132 --> 17:11.359
Shit.

17:13.202 --> 17:14.760
Emma, go get me some blankets.

17:14.837 --> 17:16.771
- OK.
- l磍l go with you.

17:16.839 --> 17:18.396
What磗 wrong with him?

17:19.407 --> 17:21.968
Exhaustion, dehydration.

17:22.044 --> 17:24.478
We just gotta keep him stabilized.

17:25.047 --> 17:28.676
Keep him warm.
Get some fluids into him.

17:34.456 --> 17:36.822
- What the hell is happening here, man?
- l don磘 know.

17:36.892 --> 17:41.352
But whoever Steven is afraid of has
now taken out the phone and the cars.

17:41.430 --> 17:43.330
He磗 probably out there right now.

17:46.402 --> 17:49.030
All right... All right, look.

17:49.104 --> 17:51.629
He said something about not,
not going back.

17:51.707 --> 17:53.299
Not going back where?

17:54.143 --> 17:57.010
l mean, do you think
he磗 been kidnapped?

17:57.079 --> 18:00.537
We磖e not gonna find any answers
from Steven until he recovers.

18:00.649 --> 18:03.641
Let him rest,
we can ask him questions in the morning.

18:03.686 --> 18:06.621
What? Fuck that, man,
l want some answers now!

18:06.689 --> 18:09.089
- Steven! Talk to me!
- [woman] Stop it!

18:09.158 --> 18:12.127
Would you all calm
the fuck down right now?!

18:12.194 --> 18:13.320
[woman sobs]

18:13.395 --> 18:15.158
- All right.
- Calm.

18:16.098 --> 18:17.998
- Easy.
- l磎 sorry.

18:20.803 --> 18:21.963
lt磗 OK.

18:22.938 --> 18:26.203
lf that was Nico and Steven
was still missing, l磀 be upset too.

18:26.909 --> 18:30.868
But... we磖e all on our own now.

18:30.946 --> 18:34.313
So we just have to stay calm
and take care of Steven.

18:34.383 --> 18:35.577
- All right?
- All right.

18:35.651 --> 18:38.643
l磍l make a run to the highway in the
morning. lt磗 too dangerous in the dark.

18:38.721 --> 18:40.689
You really think someone磗 out there?

18:42.758 --> 18:43.986
Do you have a gun?

18:46.362 --> 18:48.660
- Yeah.
- What?

18:49.198 --> 18:52.656
All right, l磎 gonna get the gun,
you guys check the windows and doors.

18:52.735 --> 18:54.259
[man] OK, good idea.

19:44.286 --> 19:45.548
How we doing?

19:46.088 --> 19:47.077
Uh...

19:48.624 --> 19:50.956
Good. All the doors
and windows are locked.

19:51.026 --> 19:53.392
So what磖e you planning
on doing with that anyway?

19:53.462 --> 19:55.020
l磍l do whatever l have to.

19:55.097 --> 19:56.894
Hell, l磍l shoot anyone
who comes close.

19:56.966 --> 19:58.228
- You磖e drunk, Peter.
- So what?

19:58.300 --> 20:00.860
So l don磘 want any accidents happening.

20:00.936 --> 20:04.531
All right, fine. But if it comes down
to it, you磀 better not hesitate.

20:08.010 --> 20:09.875
How is he?

20:09.945 --> 20:11.412
Out cold.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.971
Let him sleep.
lt磗 the best thing for him now.

20:15.551 --> 20:17.075
Strong pulse.

20:22.291 --> 20:25.920
- You OK?
- No, not really.

20:25.995 --> 20:27.963
He磗 back, Sarah.

20:34.670 --> 20:36.501
l磎 sorry about earlier.

20:38.173 --> 20:40.266
No, you don磘 have to apologize.

20:42.611 --> 20:44.545
l can磘 believe he磗 here.

20:45.848 --> 20:47.406
Neither can l.

20:49.752 --> 20:52.653
And he just turns up
after all this time.

21:04.066 --> 21:07.399
Birth... is pain.

21:09.571 --> 21:12.597
- Each nail...
- [man grunting in pain]

21:12.674 --> 21:16.576
...each new square of flesh...

21:16.645 --> 21:22.174
...wrenches you further from the fleshy
existence you knew before.

21:22.251 --> 21:26.745
- [screams]
- Mmm...

21:38.400 --> 21:40.163
[exhales]

21:43.605 --> 21:45.072
What you got there, Em?

21:46.475 --> 21:48.067
Puzzle box.

21:48.143 --> 21:49.610
Where did you get that?

21:51.246 --> 21:53.339
You know where l got it.

21:53.415 --> 21:55.474
You磛e been in the bag?

21:55.551 --> 21:59.612
Wait a minute. ls that the thing
Nico was playing with in the video?

21:59.721 --> 22:02.485
Yeah, it is. Why do you have it?

22:02.524 --> 22:05.049
You guys never told us you...
that was found in their bags.

22:05.127 --> 22:09.962
lt opens. lf l could just...
figure it out.

22:14.036 --> 22:15.628
[rumbling]

22:16.839 --> 22:19.034
lt磗 an earthquake.
Everyone just stay calm.

22:19.108 --> 22:20.598
[frightened chatter]

22:22.211 --> 22:23.200
[Emma] Oh, my God!

22:23.278 --> 22:26.543
Dad... what磗 happening?

22:36.925 --> 22:39.621
- What the...
- What the hell is going on?!

22:41.463 --> 22:43.761
- [Emma] Oh, no.
- [hammering]

22:55.878 --> 22:57.846
Ross... why?

22:59.448 --> 23:00.938
lt is almost time.

23:01.984 --> 23:05.818
- l磎 scared. l don磘 understand.
- [Emma] Oh, God. Oh, my God.

23:05.888 --> 23:07.116
[glass breaks]

23:09.324 --> 23:10.916
[Emma] What was that?

23:10.993 --> 23:13.689
Oh, my gosh, l磎 scared.

23:15.864 --> 23:16.990
Where磗 Steven?

23:17.666 --> 23:19.861
Oh, where is he?
Steven?!

23:19.935 --> 23:21.493
- Steven!
- Hey, hey, hey!

23:21.570 --> 23:22.764
- Where did he go?
- Hey, hey.

23:22.838 --> 23:23.998
- Calm down.
- But where is he?!

23:24.072 --> 23:27.235
Everything磗 gonna be fine.
Come on, we磍l find him.

23:27.309 --> 23:29.504
OK, l磍l go this way.

23:34.850 --> 23:36.215
Steven?

23:38.620 --> 23:41.282
[Ross] He磗 here. He磗 outside.

23:53.202 --> 23:55.432
Why is he just standing there?

23:58.307 --> 23:59.569
Steven?

24:06.014 --> 24:07.379
Steven?

24:08.217 --> 24:10.151
They磖e coming.

24:11.520 --> 24:15.081
The ones that creepy bastard...

24:15.157 --> 24:18.183
...that vagrant, called the Cenobites.

24:19.328 --> 24:21.023
What vagrant?

24:22.231 --> 24:24.631
Who are the Cenobites?

24:24.700 --> 24:28.534
He said they could take the pain away.

24:30.372 --> 24:32.840
He said they would
show us something different.

24:34.042 --> 24:35.509
Something better.

24:36.545 --> 24:39.446
Something beyond the limits.

25:04.039 --> 25:05.563
Good times.

25:06.341 --> 25:08.138
You got a better idea?

25:12.748 --> 25:14.716
Yeah, l do.
How about anything?

25:20.122 --> 25:22.283
What if they find our fingerprints?

25:22.357 --> 25:25.258
When do you think
that shithole was last cleaned?

25:26.895 --> 25:30.854
Trust me. Thing磗 got prints
dating back to the last ice age.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.569
Besides, life磗 cheap down here.

25:34.636 --> 25:37.764
There磗 probably something
like 1 00 killings a week.

25:37.839 --> 25:39.830
She磗 already just a number.

25:42.377 --> 25:44.174
A statistic.

25:49.217 --> 25:52.243
Whoa, we磖e not looking
for any new friends, amigo.

25:52.321 --> 25:53.811
Comprende?

25:53.889 --> 25:57.552
lt seems to me you could
use a friend right now.

26:00.862 --> 26:03.023
- You think?
- Well...

26:04.132 --> 26:05.895
A rat hole like this...

26:06.935 --> 26:08.596
...a couple of preppies...

26:09.104 --> 26:13.541
...reeking of... [sniffs]
privilege.

26:15.043 --> 26:17.637
Tells me you... need a way out.

26:18.914 --> 26:22.077
- Or a way in.
- Sir, whatever it is you磖e selling,

26:22.150 --> 26:24.482
no thank you.

26:34.796 --> 26:36.024
What磗 that?

26:37.099 --> 26:38.396
Experience.

26:38.967 --> 26:42.334
Yeah, well, we磛e had
enough of that for this trip.

26:42.404 --> 26:44.463
Hold on. Experience?

26:44.539 --> 26:48.669
Oh, it磗 a form of ultimate arousal.

26:48.744 --> 26:50.177
[Nico] What, like sex?

26:50.946 --> 26:54.507
No, it磗 better than that.
lt磗 better than sex.

26:54.583 --> 26:57.484
- Better than sex?
- Sex has limits.

26:59.354 --> 27:00.343
So does killing.

27:03.191 --> 27:04.488
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

27:07.262 --> 27:09.890
This will take you beyond the limits.

27:09.965 --> 27:14.334
To places you can磘
even begin to imagine.

27:14.403 --> 27:17.463
- Sensual pain.
- Hold on.

27:17.539 --> 27:20.997
Pain? What, like bondage and shit?

27:21.076 --> 27:22.566
Let me ask you something.

27:23.812 --> 27:28.374
How can we experience ultimate pleasure,

27:28.450 --> 27:31.078
without experiencing ultimate pain?

27:31.153 --> 27:34.145
How can we taste the truly sweet,

27:34.222 --> 27:35.985
without a little bit of the sour?

27:36.057 --> 27:37.991
Wow, man, that磗 some beautiful poetry,

27:38.059 --> 27:39.959
but if you don磘 mind,
we磖e gonna get out of here.

27:40.028 --> 27:42.519
[man] Death is a finality.

27:43.732 --> 27:47.668
There磗 no beauty in that...
as you both know.

27:47.736 --> 27:50.330
All right, listen,
l don磘 know where this is going...

27:50.405 --> 27:53.272
How many people
have you known who磛e...

27:53.341 --> 27:56.276
...come close to death and survived?

27:56.344 --> 28:00.576
Every day for them is the best day ever.

28:00.682 --> 28:03.845
Every sensation a symphony.

28:05.587 --> 28:07.714
That磗 what this does.

28:09.758 --> 28:12.124
That磗 what they offer.

28:12.194 --> 28:13.525
Who?

28:13.595 --> 28:14.926
The Cenobites.

28:17.466 --> 28:18.524
The what?

28:18.600 --> 28:22.400
Angels... prayers...

28:23.638 --> 28:26.072
...conductors...

28:26.141 --> 28:28.575
...surgeons, and more.

28:41.756 --> 28:43.553
The box...

28:46.394 --> 28:47.452
...how does it work?

28:48.997 --> 28:52.296
Open it... and you磍l find out.

28:53.335 --> 28:54.825
How much do you want for it?

28:55.804 --> 28:58.796
Oh, it磗 not for sale.

28:58.907 --> 29:01.671
lt磗 yours already, Nico.

29:03.812 --> 29:05.473
lt always was.

29:05.547 --> 29:08.778
You see, they磛e been
watching you, Nico.

29:30.038 --> 29:32.302
Would you put that away?

29:32.374 --> 29:34.205
Put it away!

29:35.510 --> 29:37.410
That homeless fuck
really creeped me out.

29:37.479 --> 29:39.003
lt磗 just a puzzle.

29:40.081 --> 29:42.675
The prize is probably
two free passes to the donkey show.

29:42.751 --> 29:45.083
OK, haven磘 you done
enough shit for one trip?

29:45.153 --> 29:47.053

29:55.864 --> 29:58.162
Exactly what you think it means.
You磖e weak.

29:58.233 --> 29:59.393
You always were.

29:59.467 --> 30:02.698
You let your parents cut your balls off
at every single turn.

30:02.771 --> 30:04.898
And you just sit there
and you take it.

30:04.973 --> 30:06.838
- Screw you.
- Truth hurts, Steve-o.

30:09.544 --> 30:12.445
- Hey!

30:13.048 --> 30:14.675

30:15.317 --> 30:17.114
- Yeah? How do you know?
- l just do.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.410
Besides, the dude gave it to me.

30:20.488 --> 30:22.547
You wanna be helpful,

[bell tolling]

30:57.092 --> 30:58.582
[distant boom]

31:01.162 --> 31:02.322
What was that?

31:04.065 --> 31:06.499

31:06.568 --> 31:07.796
[rumbling]

31:09.404 --> 31:11.065
No, that磗 not the churches.

31:12.407 --> 31:13.567
Oh...

31:14.776 --> 31:16.676
What the fuck is going on?

31:17.979 --> 31:19.640
[Nico] Who the fuck are you

31:19.714 --> 31:21.306

Just get the fuck outta here.

31:24.319 --> 31:26.150

31:26.221 --> 31:29.418
You opened it.
Summoned us.

31:29.491 --> 31:32.153
- And we came.
- Came for what?! Who the fuck are you?!

31:32.227 --> 31:33.489
We came for you, Nico.

31:33.561 --> 31:35.392
No, no, no!

31:35.463 --> 31:36.725
Go on, get outta here.

31:36.798 --> 31:39.767
[Pinhead] This is not a matter
for negotiation.

31:39.834 --> 31:41.358
Steven!

31:42.404 --> 31:43.632
[screaming]

31:44.773 --> 31:46.604

31:54.983 --> 31:57.952
Everything磗 gonna be OK, sweetheart.

31:58.019 --> 31:59.452
You just need a little time.

31:59.554 --> 32:02.853
Did he try to escape with you, too?

32:02.891 --> 32:04.358
Did you help him?

32:04.426 --> 32:06.758
Please tell me where my son is.

32:09.197 --> 32:13.793
He... he didn磘 want to come back.

32:13.868 --> 32:15.859
He wanted to stay.

32:23.745 --> 32:25.406
Where are you going?

32:27.315 --> 32:29.681
You have $1 00 on you?

32:31.786 --> 32:34.220

32:36.024 --> 32:38.925

32:56.478 --> 32:58.469
[breathing heavily]

33:52.700 --> 33:54.565

33:56.771 --> 33:58.796
I need blood.

34:02.210 --> 34:04.371

34:04.445 --> 34:06.504
It磗 the only way. Kill her!

34:06.581 --> 34:08.344
Get the fuck off!

34:10.618 --> 34:11.777
[whimpers]

34:15.889 --> 34:17.187
[shouts]

34:20.061 --> 34:22.585
[panting]

34:35.976 --> 34:39.639
Steven! Her blood brought me back.

34:42.050 --> 34:43.984
Bring me more.

34:54.728 --> 34:56.356
They磖e coming.

34:56.431 --> 34:57.989
创They创?

34:58.066 --> 35:00.591
The Cenobites.

35:00.702 --> 35:03.330
They don磘 like to lose souls.

35:04.505 --> 35:05.995
What do they want?

35:12.447 --> 35:17.043
They want to experience your flesh.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.611
[all gasping, grunting]

35:20.688 --> 35:22.212
Peter, help me.

35:51.219 --> 35:53.016
OK.

35:53.087 --> 35:55.681
So, Cenobite, it says here:

35:55.757 --> 35:58.817
创A member of a religious group
living together

35:58.927 --> 36:00.622
in a monastic community.创

36:00.662 --> 36:03.722
- What?
- Cenobite, it磗 the word Steven said.

36:03.798 --> 36:05.993
l磀 never heard it before,
so l looked it up.

36:06.067 --> 36:07.466
A monastic community.

36:17.011 --> 36:18.603
Do you think it磗 an antique?

36:19.881 --> 36:21.371
Maybe they stole it?

36:21.616 --> 36:22.878
[panting, whimpering]

36:24.319 --> 36:26.310
[screaming]

36:33.828 --> 36:35.819
No!

36:42.637 --> 36:46.232
Pain and pleasure.

36:47.742 --> 36:49.573
lndivisible.

36:56.551 --> 36:58.485
- Dad?!
- lt磗 all right, Steven.

36:59.754 --> 37:00.778
lt磗 all right.

37:02.924 --> 37:06.052

- Outside?

37:06.127 --> 37:08.118
You were outside, honey.

37:08.930 --> 37:10.158

37:18.539 --> 37:19.972

37:41.629 --> 37:44.189
We have it. What is it?

37:47.435 --> 37:50.097

- To what?

37:53.741 --> 37:55.538
l磎 not sure.

37:55.610 --> 37:58.078
Well, then why do you want it so badly?

Promise you磍l help me.

38:10.925 --> 38:12.950

38:37.118 --> 38:40.178
- l give up.
- You磖e trying too hard.

38:42.156 --> 38:44.522
- You磖e trying too hard.
- Really?

38:47.562 --> 38:50.963
lt磗 like it wants to open,

38:52.366 --> 38:54.197
but you have to want it as well.

38:56.838 --> 38:58.601
lf you try to force it...

39:00.041 --> 39:01.269
...then nothing happens.

39:02.877 --> 39:05.505
You have to just let go.

39:09.784 --> 39:12.275
[breathing heavily]

39:22.563 --> 39:24.360
You have to desire it.

39:30.805 --> 39:31.897
Emma.

39:33.941 --> 39:36.171
Take this to your brother.

39:37.979 --> 39:39.537
You don磘 need that.

40:24.592 --> 40:26.958
- You磖e stealing my soup?
- Shit.

40:27.028 --> 40:28.290
You磖e awake.

Stay with me.

40:43.511 --> 40:46.002

- Uh-huh?

40:46.847 --> 40:48.439
Why did you go?

40:50.718 --> 40:52.583
l just couldn磘 stay here anymore.

40:52.653 --> 40:55.247
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

40:56.190 --> 40:58.715
- Was l one of them?
- Not at all.

40:58.826 --> 41:02.091
There were things happening here
that l couldn磘 tell you about.

41:02.129 --> 41:06.065
lt all got to be too much.
l had to leave.

41:06.634 --> 41:08.465
- And Nico?
- Same.

41:08.536 --> 41:11.699
But he never stopped thinking about you.

41:11.772 --> 41:15.640
- Neither did l.
- l missed you both so much.

41:15.710 --> 41:17.541
l磎 sorry, Emma.

41:21.616 --> 41:24.141

Everywhere.

41:26.254 --> 41:28.017

41:29.290 --> 41:31.349
There磗 a whole world out there, Emma.

41:32.627 --> 41:35.323
A whole world of experiences.

41:36.931 --> 41:41.095
You just have to...
reach out and touch them.

41:43.938 --> 41:48.773
Well, you went to all those places,
but you never bought me anything.

41:48.843 --> 41:51.141
- But l did.
- Really?

41:52.613 --> 41:55.514
The box. l got that for you.

41:55.583 --> 41:57.107
Seriously?

41:58.519 --> 42:01.647

42:01.722 --> 42:05.818
When l touch it, l... l feel...

42:09.730 --> 42:10.822
ls it a puzzle?

42:12.500 --> 42:14.695
lt磗 more like the answer.

42:14.769 --> 42:16.828
l don磘 understand.

42:17.705 --> 42:19.104
You will.

42:27.748 --> 42:29.511
l can磘 drink any more of this.

42:31.485 --> 42:32.918
Wanna finish it?

42:34.455 --> 42:35.786
Sure.

42:45.833 --> 42:47.130
What?

42:48.202 --> 42:49.760

- Oh.

42:52.173 --> 42:53.731
Let me get it.

43:07.822 --> 43:10.347
You磛e grown up so much.

43:13.694 --> 43:17.130
You磖e so... beautiful.

43:20.301 --> 43:23.327
l missed you so much.

43:23.404 --> 43:25.031

43:32.546 --> 43:33.535
[Emma] Oh.

44:13.087 --> 44:14.952
[gasping]

44:21.262 --> 44:22.559
[woman] It磗 just a box.

44:22.630 --> 44:25.622
[Ross] Maybe. But it seems to be
important to a lot of people.

44:27.835 --> 44:29.769
There磗 something that磗
just not right about it.

44:31.672 --> 44:34.334
Look, are you really sure
someone磗 out there?

44:34.408 --> 44:37.104
Maybe Steven did all this.
The phone, the car...

44:37.178 --> 44:38.975
- Why would he do that?
- l don磘 know.

44:39.046 --> 44:41.879
But something磗 not right here.
None of this adds up.

44:41.949 --> 44:44.144
And we磖e just sitting here waiting.

44:47.421 --> 44:50.151
l say we get out there and take a look.
Check things out.

44:50.224 --> 44:51.213
Peter...

44:55.729 --> 44:57.094
Ross, what do you think?

45:00.501 --> 45:01.991
lt can磘 do any harm.

45:07.708 --> 45:09.005
[sets glass down]

- Let磗 just take a look around.

45:23.757 --> 45:25.554
This is fucked up.

45:42.710 --> 45:44.405
There磗 no one out here.

45:45.880 --> 45:49.077
l guess you磖e right.
Must磛e been Steven.

45:50.050 --> 45:51.483
Sorry, man.

45:52.620 --> 45:53.644
Let磗 get back inside.

Look, this is private property.
What do you want?

46:22.783 --> 46:25.115
All right, l磛e had enough of this shit.
Give me the gun.

46:26.220 --> 46:30.247
Hey, what the hell磗

46:30.324 --> 46:33.384
You come around fucking with people,
doing God knows what to their kids?

46:33.460 --> 46:35.223
This is private property, jerk-off,

46:35.296 --> 46:38.288
that means that legally l can blow
the shit out of you right now

46:38.365 --> 46:39.957
and ask questions later.

46:40.701 --> 46:42.498
Are you deaf, asshole?!

48:29.543 --> 48:31.943
- l can磘 hear him.
- [woman] Oh, God!

48:32.012 --> 48:34.503
They磖e... they磖e coming.

48:34.581 --> 48:38.574
- They磖e coming.
- Oh, come on, Peter.

48:38.652 --> 48:41.314
l love you!
Stay with me!

48:41.388 --> 48:44.619
No, Peter, no! No!

48:44.692 --> 48:47.160
No! [sobbing]

48:48.729 --> 48:50.594
No!

48:53.200 --> 48:56.294
Sarah, take Katie to the living room.

48:57.871 --> 49:00.305
- No!
- Emma, go with them.

49:00.407 --> 49:02.875
- Go with them!
- [Katie] No!

49:06.613 --> 49:08.240
[Katie continues screaming]

49:16.323 --> 49:18.052
[Katie sobs]

49:22.629 --> 49:24.290
Jesus Christ.

49:30.537 --> 49:32.334
Hey, Mom.

49:36.076 --> 49:37.509
Here, give me the gun, son.

49:37.945 --> 49:39.003
Hm?

49:41.882 --> 49:43.509
Be careful, Steven, it磗 loaded.

49:43.951 --> 49:44.940
Oh.

49:45.753 --> 49:47.015
- [grunting]
- [Emma screams]

49:49.123 --> 49:52.650
l磎 guessing you磖e all
a little confused right now.

49:52.726 --> 49:57.561
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- Shut the fuck up, little girl!

49:57.631 --> 50:00.156
- The grown-ups are talking.
- Why are you doing this?

50:01.835 --> 50:06.966
Because l hate this shithole,

50:07.040 --> 50:08.507
nowhere town.

50:09.643 --> 50:13.101
We both hated it. That磗 why we left.

50:13.180 --> 50:17.446
We simply had to get the fuck out
of this bullshit Generica.

50:19.653 --> 50:21.450
We wanted something else.

50:22.189 --> 50:23.417
Anything else.

50:23.490 --> 50:27.950
Anything besides the reality
of the same job,

50:28.028 --> 50:29.655
fucking the same women,

50:29.730 --> 50:32.858
eating the same fucking food
day in and day out

50:32.933 --> 50:34.298
for the next 50 years.

50:34.368 --> 50:37.064
lt doesn磘 have to be that way, Steven.

50:42.009 --> 50:45.570
You磍l understand
when you have your own children.

50:45.646 --> 50:48.513
Children. Why?

50:50.551 --> 50:53.145
So they can end up
as fucked up as me?

50:53.787 --> 50:57.848
l磎 miserable.
l磎 depressed. l磎 unfulfilled.

50:57.925 --> 51:01.918
So l磍l bring in another life into this
world and see if that entertains me.

51:01.995 --> 51:03.860
Good plan!

51:03.931 --> 51:06.331
How did that work out for you?

51:06.400 --> 51:08.527
- [grunting in pain]
- [women gasping]

51:09.570 --> 51:11.731
Not so good.

51:17.244 --> 51:18.836
l don磘 understand.

51:18.912 --> 51:21.312
This isn磘 you, Steven.

51:21.381 --> 51:23.144
This isn磘 you talking.

51:25.085 --> 51:30.318
That磗 the first sensible thing
l磛e heard you say all night.

51:35.863 --> 51:39.230
[foreign language]

51:41.268 --> 51:43.463
- How much?
- [foreign language]

51:43.537 --> 51:45.129
How much?

52:44.631 --> 52:45.962
[chuckling]

52:57.311 --> 52:59.905
[chuckles, coughs]

53:03.850 --> 53:05.943
[gasping, crying]

53:24.371 --> 53:26.100
Do it!

53:27.908 --> 53:29.034
No.

53:31.845 --> 53:34.905
- No, l can磘.
- Don磘 be weak.

53:34.982 --> 53:37.143
- Kill her!
- She has a baby, Nico!

53:37.217 --> 53:39.742
You wanna kill her?
Do it yourself!

53:39.820 --> 53:41.947
l磎 not doing this
for you anymore, Nico!

53:42.823 --> 53:46.054
You磖e pathetic.
Get out of here.

53:49.863 --> 53:52.423
- [baby crying]
- [woman whimpering]

53:52.499 --> 53:53.591
- [cracking]
- [woman grunts]

53:56.737 --> 54:00.070
[baby continues crying]

54:20.160 --> 54:21.991
- [cracking]
- [crying stops]

54:31.905 --> 54:33.463
l can磘 do this anymore.

54:37.177 --> 54:39.111
We磛e come so far.

54:39.713 --> 54:42.409
The world will open up for us.

54:44.184 --> 54:47.085
l磛e seen things barely imagined.

54:48.255 --> 54:52.624
- Crossed the Rubicon.
- What磗 left for me here?

54:52.692 --> 54:57.095
One more time.
Bring me a man so l can take his skin.

54:57.164 --> 55:00.964
And then l promise,
it will all be over. l promise!

55:01.068 --> 55:03.093
No, l... No.

55:03.136 --> 55:05.570
l can磘 do this.

55:08.975 --> 55:10.101
l磎 done.

55:13.513 --> 55:14.844
You won磘 do it?

55:15.315 --> 55:17.909
You won磘 do it for your best friend?

55:17.984 --> 55:20.145
After everything that
we磛e been through.

55:20.220 --> 55:21.744
After everything that we磛e done.

55:28.662 --> 55:31.722
l磛e given you the shirt off my back.

55:39.506 --> 55:40.905
- No!
- [grunts]

55:50.016 --> 55:52.746
lt磗 not the shirt off your back
that l want.

55:58.525 --> 56:00.618
[sobbing]

56:02.329 --> 56:03.557
What磗 the matter, Mother?

56:07.267 --> 56:11.761
Don磘 you recognize
your dear, precious boy?

56:14.674 --> 56:16.505
What have you done with my son?

56:17.711 --> 56:19.338
l haven磘 done anything.

56:20.480 --> 56:22.971
ls he alive?

56:23.049 --> 56:27.713
Oh, Steven磗 alive.
ln a way.

56:28.488 --> 56:32.322
But those... boyish good looks
that l now possess...

56:34.661 --> 56:37.027
...they磖e all gone, I磎 afraid.

56:40.100 --> 56:42.568
[Sarah] You stole his skin?

56:44.304 --> 56:46.033
[Nico] He wasn磘 using it.

56:51.211 --> 56:52.473
Nico.

56:52.546 --> 56:54.104
Not so fast, Mother.

56:54.181 --> 56:58.174
- Sit down and shut up!
- [gasping, crying]

57:04.224 --> 57:07.284
l don磘 know why you磖e spilling tears

57:07.360 --> 57:09.555
for Father dearest, there,

57:09.629 --> 57:13.827
when your true love
lies bleeding to death.

57:16.102 --> 57:18.263
What are you talking about?

57:20.040 --> 57:22.406
l磎 talking about you

57:22.475 --> 57:25.069
fucking Stevie磗 dad.

57:28.081 --> 57:29.446
l know.

57:30.684 --> 57:32.311
We both know.

57:33.553 --> 57:38.047
Hell, it was one of the reasons
we decided to fly the fucking coop.

57:38.124 --> 57:41.787
lf this is an example of the perfect,

57:41.861 --> 57:44.830
all-American family unit in action,

57:44.898 --> 57:47.332
then count me the fuck out.

57:48.835 --> 57:50.132
ls this true?

57:53.573 --> 57:55.473
Oh, you磖e one to play high and mighty.

57:58.812 --> 58:02.680
Aww... Little Emma...

58:04.417 --> 58:05.748
[crying]

58:05.819 --> 58:08.014
...you know you磖e a naughty girl, Emma.

58:09.889 --> 58:12.551
Making out with your own brother.

58:12.626 --> 58:13.888
Yeah.

58:15.495 --> 58:19.625
Emma! Give me the box.

58:19.699 --> 58:21.360
l don磘 have it!

58:23.336 --> 58:24.826
lt磗 here.

58:24.904 --> 58:26.462
l can feel it.

58:27.140 --> 58:28.869
Tell you what.

58:28.942 --> 58:32.036
l磍l give you 30 seconds

58:32.112 --> 58:34.273
to go get it...

58:34.347 --> 58:36.815
...or l磍l shoot your mommy in the face.

58:40.053 --> 58:41.281
- Go!
- [shrieks]

58:46.226 --> 58:47.284
[sighs]

58:52.265 --> 58:53.664
Mr. Craven?

58:56.136 --> 58:57.865
How about an apology?

58:57.937 --> 58:59.268
For what?

58:59.372 --> 59:03.706
For fucking my mother
and ruining both of our families.

59:07.380 --> 59:08.779
l磎 sorry.

59:11.818 --> 59:13.718
- Thank you.
- No!

59:14.421 --> 59:16.286
Not you, you little shit.

59:16.356 --> 59:18.085
Sarah.

59:22.162 --> 59:23.220
Oh.

59:24.230 --> 59:28.758
Sorry that you were fucking around on
her or sorry you just got caught?

59:30.503 --> 59:32.494
You know what? l don磘 care.

59:32.572 --> 59:36.872
l磎 not sorry
that l fucked your little daughter.

59:38.011 --> 59:41.708
That l was the first one
inside little Emma.

59:43.183 --> 59:47.085
That mine was the first cock

59:47.153 --> 59:49.815
she ever sucked.

59:54.794 --> 59:57.092
l didn磘 even like her that much.

59:58.898 --> 01:00:00.195
[Sarah] Nico...

01:00:01.134 --> 01:00:03.193
...where磗 Steven?

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:06.238
Where磗 my son?

01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:14.143
[Steven, weakly] Nico.

01:00:14.214 --> 01:00:19.277
Nico, please. [whimpers]

01:00:31.731 --> 01:00:34.495
Nico, you磖e home now.

01:00:34.567 --> 01:00:37.058
Why are you doing this to us?

01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:40.163
[sobbing] lt doesn磘 matter anymore,
you磖e home.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.174
lt磗 not that simple, Mother.

01:00:43.276 --> 01:00:46.939
But why? Why are you like this?

01:00:52.118 --> 01:00:56.418
Now... give me the box.

01:00:56.489 --> 01:00:59.720
- Why do you need it?
- Hand the fucking thing over!

01:01:01.861 --> 01:01:03.726
What are you gonna do with it?

01:01:04.964 --> 01:01:07.797
Attempt to save what磗 left of my soul.

01:01:09.602 --> 01:01:12.400
lf only that spineless brother of yours

01:01:12.472 --> 01:01:15.464
had helped me the fuck out of this mess!

01:01:16.743 --> 01:01:20.406
l磛e been on the run
from them ever since.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.574
An eternity of torture

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:25.743
isn磘 exactly what l have in mind.

01:01:25.819 --> 01:01:27.912
l like to taste,

01:01:27.987 --> 01:01:29.955
l like to feel,

01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:34.824
l love to fuck.

01:01:36.362 --> 01:01:41.095
And l磎 not exactly ready to see any one
of those avenues of pleasure

01:01:41.167 --> 01:01:43.101
cut off to me just yet.

01:01:45.738 --> 01:01:47.501
l need the box to call them.

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:50.942
l磎 thinking l can swing a trade.

01:01:53.713 --> 01:01:56.580
You mean all of us for you?

01:02:00.553 --> 01:02:02.282
Oh, no. No.

01:02:04.023 --> 01:02:05.581
Just you, sweetie.

01:02:06.726 --> 01:02:08.125
Yeah.

01:02:08.728 --> 01:02:10.525
Fresh...

01:02:11.464 --> 01:02:12.897
...innocent.

01:02:14.434 --> 01:02:17.335
They磖e going to love you.

01:02:21.207 --> 01:02:22.401
- [grunts]
- [screams]

01:02:22.475 --> 01:02:25.103
Not so fucking innocent, am l?!

01:02:27.213 --> 01:02:28.271
[screams]

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.711
Now open the fucking box!

01:03:06.886 --> 01:03:08.877
- [rattling]
- [woman whimpers]

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:17.286
[rumbling]

01:03:21.067 --> 01:03:23.729
Here we go.

01:03:23.803 --> 01:03:25.794
[whimpering]

01:03:35.582 --> 01:03:37.243
[Emma] Oh, my God!

01:03:58.137 --> 01:03:59.229
[Emma] No.

01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:03.799
[Pinhead] You have a darkness
that rivals my own, Nico.

01:04:03.843 --> 01:04:09.543
lt will be a very special pleasure
to rip you apart.

01:04:17.056 --> 01:04:18.546
Hang on, hang on.

01:04:19.258 --> 01:04:20.885
She opened the box, the girl!

01:04:26.432 --> 01:04:29.833
Steven? Steven, is that you?

01:04:32.672 --> 01:04:33.866
Steven?

01:04:35.141 --> 01:04:38.110
Human names, human memories,

01:04:38.177 --> 01:04:42.204
they have no place, nor meaning,
in our existence.

01:04:44.317 --> 01:04:47.309
- [screaming]
- Leave her alone!

01:04:48.888 --> 01:04:51.186
Unless you want to taste her blood,

01:04:51.724 --> 01:04:54.522
feel her freshly razored flesh
against you,

01:04:54.594 --> 01:04:56.721
you磍l sit in silence.

01:04:56.796 --> 01:04:59.663
We have no desire for you.

01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:06.461
He made her open the box.

01:05:10.243 --> 01:05:11.608
[screaming]

01:05:19.585 --> 01:05:22.418
- [crying]
- [sobbing]

01:05:42.075 --> 01:05:43.906
Now, you will come with us.

01:05:43.976 --> 01:05:47.776
No. No, no! l... l called you here.

01:05:47.847 --> 01:05:49.815
l called you to trade her for me.

01:05:52.418 --> 01:05:53.908
Trade?

01:05:55.288 --> 01:05:56.277
No.

01:06:01.427 --> 01:06:02.451
Shit.

01:06:05.231 --> 01:06:07.495
Oh, God!

01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:10.434
Oh, my God!
[screaming]

01:06:11.838 --> 01:06:13.601
Oh, God!

01:06:15.408 --> 01:06:17.638
No! No!

01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:21.669
This trinket of sensation you feel now
will be a delight

01:06:21.748 --> 01:06:26.947
compared to the onslaught of agony
that awaits at our hands.

01:06:29.055 --> 01:06:31.148
These banal beings have nothing.

01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:34.225
Desire has abandoned them all.

01:06:35.995 --> 01:06:40.762
Except for her. The dark seed that grew
within you now germinates within her.

01:06:43.236 --> 01:06:48.503
The time will come when her
own twisted desires will ripen.

01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:52.475
Then she will call to us on her own.

01:06:53.312 --> 01:06:56.406
[gasps, sobs]

01:06:57.817 --> 01:06:59.444
[Pinhead] Bring him.

01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:14.224
No one gets to kill you but me,
you little fuck.

01:07:17.603 --> 01:07:19.434
Thank you.

01:07:23.943 --> 01:07:25.410
Fool.

01:07:25.478 --> 01:07:28.572
We had all we desired.

01:07:28.648 --> 01:07:31.082
Our appetite was sated.

01:07:32.118 --> 01:07:33.676
And the eternity of suffering

01:07:33.753 --> 01:07:36.119
he would磛e experienced at our hands,

01:07:36.189 --> 01:07:39.955
would磛e been more vengeance for you
then you can possibly imagine.

01:07:40.026 --> 01:07:43.484
But your actions have denied us.

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:47.363
Denied us that exquisite joy.

01:07:47.433 --> 01:07:50.027
Now there is a deficit of flesh.

01:07:51.771 --> 01:07:53.671
Debt is outstanding.

01:07:54.707 --> 01:07:56.868
And we seek payment.

01:07:58.044 --> 01:08:00.740
No. No, please take me.

01:08:00.847 --> 01:08:02.337
No.

01:08:03.749 --> 01:08:07.082
What few moments you have remaining

01:08:07.153 --> 01:08:09.121
will be spent in the agony...

01:08:09.188 --> 01:08:11.588
- Please.
- ...that the indulgence

01:08:11.657 --> 01:08:14.182
of your own foolish vanity

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:16.524
has cursed your wife

01:08:16.595 --> 01:08:20.725
to unparalleled terrors
at the hands of others.

01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:24.163
[screaming]
[Ross] No, Sarah! Not my wife!

01:08:24.937 --> 01:08:25.961
No!

01:08:26.505 --> 01:08:29.837
No! No!

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:32.707
[crying]

01:08:37.884 --> 01:08:41.341
Even that which is born of the flesh...

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.548
...is still just flesh.

01:08:44.624 --> 01:08:47.218
Then no flesh shall be spared.

01:08:49.761 --> 01:08:52.595
[screaming]

01:08:55.368 --> 01:08:57.928
- [groans]
- [continues sobbing]

01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:03.537
l磎 so sorry.

01:09:06.612 --> 01:09:09.740
When this existence
ceases to fulfill,

01:09:12.018 --> 01:09:13.747
we will be waiting.

01:09:24.296 --> 01:09:25.854
l love you.

01:09:28.501 --> 01:09:31.868
[sobbing] l love you so much!
