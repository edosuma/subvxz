02:05.258 --> 02:06.293
Hey.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.803
<i>Buddy . Hey.</i>

02:10.896 --> 02:12.399
That on or off?

02:14.568 --> 02:16.138
The radio.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.478
It's on.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.285
Try another station, why don't you?

02:21.341 --> 02:22.979
Only one we get.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.817
Comes in from Fort Wayne.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.115
"Comes in from Fort Wayne."

02:32.085 --> 02:33.086
A lot of traffic.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.827
Steel mills up in Gary.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.663
Why we stay open late.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.601
Ask if we're far.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.496
How far are we from Columbus?

02:42.596 --> 02:45.372
Columbus, Ohio? 'Cause there's one in Indiana.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.001
That's not the one we want.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.046
You're about five hours.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.845
What's worth seeing around here?

02:52.939 --> 02:55.385
In Warsaw?

02:56.309 --> 03:01.224
We've got the second longest contiguous brick wall in the world.

03:01.314 --> 03:02.725
No kidding?

03:02.816 --> 03:06.059
A man from the university in Vincennes drove up and measured it.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.292
Maybe we should stay over, huh?

03:09.489 --> 03:10.866
Let's just go.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.528
My friend's got no appreciation.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.710
You keep the change now.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.720
A sawbuck on a $2 tab?

03:32.813 --> 03:35.726
We made some easy money. What's the problem?

03:35.816 --> 03:38.057
I thought we were laying low.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.735
Well?

04:05.178 --> 04:07.522
Jiggle the plugs or something.

04:33.874 --> 04:34.944
What?

05:11.244 --> 05:12.245
Slow your roll.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.261
These kids, I found 'em in a juke in Louisville.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.159
Bringing 'em along.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.459
Akron, Youngstown, Pittsburgh.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.962
Three weeks at the Stanley.

05:24.624 --> 05:25.625
They rough.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.502
They're smart boys. Pick up fast.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.302
Little patter,

05:30.363 --> 05:32.343
top hats and tails.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.002
A year from now, you come to New York,

05:34.100 --> 05:37.138
you won't find an empty seat and what you're gonna say?

05:38.471 --> 05:39.848
What I gonna say, Dickie?

05:39.940 --> 05:43.183
"Why didn't I? Oh, why didn't I?"

05:43.276 --> 05:46.120
- You selling this hard, huh?
- Check that mule's teeth first.

05:46.179 --> 05:50.286
I never sell anything. I don't have to because I represent the best.

05:50.383 --> 05:51.987
Don't I, honey?

05:52.052 --> 05:54.191
- Nothing but.
- Mmm.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.460
Would you freshen me up?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.901
You don't mind, do you, Dickie?

05:59.492 --> 06:01.494
You're thirsty, you're thirsty.

06:01.561 --> 06:02.733
What was in here again?

06:02.829 --> 06:04.399
Weren't you paying attention?

06:04.497 --> 06:05.805
New York Sour.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.403
Mix you up the Jersey version.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.714
That's all the time you got for me?

06:16.810 --> 06:19.381
Appointment in Newark.
- Do we have to, Dickie?

06:19.479 --> 06:21.254
I'm tired of traipsing.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.885
A nice hotel...

06:23.984 --> 06:27.522
Mr. White makes me happy, I make you happy.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.395
Two weeks at a grand per, then we talk about what comes after.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.993
You carpetbagging me.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.902
I'm treating you square.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.565
I always do.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.408
I want Fletcher Henderson up there.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.605
Who doesn't? But Smack's in New York.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.379
You boys break a sweat yet?

06:48.441 --> 06:50.114
No, sir. We're barely kicking it.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.348
Eldon, shake your lazy rump.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.186
Grover, let's wind that clock.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.852
Shoot some liquor to me, Eldie boy.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.468
Whoo!

07:18.972 --> 07:20.212
Whoo!

07:48.601 --> 07:49.841
You can turn a light on.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.150
All have arrived.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.153
It's easy enough to do.

08:02.248 --> 08:03.625
Then I will do it.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.765
Where is he sitting?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.635
Where you wanted him.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.131
Thank you.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.150
Everybody knows each other?

08:44.124 --> 08:47.731
Mr. Masseria and I have not actually met.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.475
You should shake it.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.372
- Does he speak English?
- He's not in the mood.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.041
I just want this to be clear.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.483
He'll understand what you say.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.051
We'd like to settle things.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.887
We think you do, too.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.189
What makes you think that?

09:11.251 --> 09:13.731
Why else would you show up?

09:13.820 --> 09:16.027
To see what the Thompson brothers are contemplating.

09:18.758 --> 09:20.601
I have my territory.

09:20.693 --> 09:24.004
South to Cape May, north to Asbury Park, west to Trenton.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.840
I have the casinos, the numbers, and the wire.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.607
I'm not looking for anything else.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.510
Haven't we had this conversation?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.846
I didn't ask for trouble.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.911
What was brought to my doorstep,

09:35.608 --> 09:37.588
I returned.

09:37.677 --> 09:40.021
I'd expect all of you to do exactly the same.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.923
You tried to put me in federal court.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.255
- You were greedy.
- And you were desperate.

09:48.455 --> 09:52.198
Fifteen of his men killed on the road out of town.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.738
- With the deal already struck.
- You landed on your feet.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.796
- You wish to pretend you never gained...
- What's wrong with that?

09:56.896 --> 09:59.467
- There was no arrangement.
- A.R. gave a guarantee.

09:59.566 --> 10:00.601
Oh!

10:02.435 --> 10:05.973
Now why I should trust any word come out of your mouth?

10:06.406 --> 10:07.476
Huh?

10:08.741 --> 10:10.482
That's a reasonable question.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.387
Let him see it.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.580
What do you want?

10:39.839 --> 10:41.318
To see a Broadway show,

10:41.407 --> 10:43.478
have the chop at Keens,

10:43.576 --> 10:45.146
do a little window-shopping,

10:45.245 --> 10:47.657
and not be looking over my shoulder every second I'm at it.

10:47.747 --> 10:48.817
And in return?

10:48.915 --> 10:50.451
Maybe you enjoy the beach here.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.621
Not especially.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.289
I want peace, Arnold. That's all.

10:56.089 --> 11:00.834
Where you shop and where you eat is no concern of ours.

11:01.194 --> 11:05.006
This ends that.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.283
How are you, Charlie?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.116
I'm well, A.R.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.188
Thanks for asking.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.020
He's a good boy.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.455
Meyer keeps me informed.

11:30.156 --> 11:33.569
OK Kid. Now we go home.

11:44.304 --> 11:49.754
"All of man's troubles come from his inability to sit quietly in a room by himself."

11:51.477 --> 11:52.512
You should try it.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.580
Is that what you do in here?

11:58.918 --> 12:00.898
I talked to Lolly. He's expecting you.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.360
No limit at the table.

12:03.489 --> 12:04.524
That's thoughtful.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.036
Call it a thank-you.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.342
I ran the odds on the way down.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.168
On what?

12:16.002 --> 12:18.175
Whether you'd attempt to kill me.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.843
What did you come up with?

12:21.007 --> 12:23.385
Fourteen to one against.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.200
- Yes.
- Yeah.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.633
Five and six and seven and eight.

12:45.865 --> 12:46.866
All right.

12:47.300 --> 12:51.476
I held Tommy in my arms when he was no bigger than a loaf of bread.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.079
I never wanted to let him go.

12:55.141 --> 12:58.645
I never wanted him hurt in any way.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.581
I'm selling my home.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.656
The only possession I have.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.959
And with the proceeds, I intend to live quietly

13:07.086 --> 13:08.588
within my means

13:08.655 --> 13:11.761
and give Tommy the upbringing he deserves

13:11.824 --> 13:14.896
in comfort and safety.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.730
Julia.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.941
And Mr. Sagorsky...

13:21.301 --> 13:23.144
Paul,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.477
I thank you.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.482
You've done so much.

13:27.573 --> 13:29.610
I'll never forget it.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.418
But my grandson belongs with me.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.984
It's time he came home.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.123
She was running a cathouse.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.621
Raising that child in a cathouse.

13:40.687 --> 13:41.757
Stay away from all that.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.265
Mrs. Darmody provided respectable lodging...

13:43.323 --> 13:45.030
And what went on in there was...

13:45.124 --> 13:47.263
As the only surviving blood relation...

13:47.327 --> 13:48.772
You can't just take things that don't belong to you.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.535
Your Honor, my clients are understandably...

13:50.630 --> 13:53.042
He wouldn't even speak for the first...

13:53.166 --> 13:57.012
What exactly occurred in your residence eight months ago, Mrs. Darmody?

13:58.705 --> 14:02.812
And under what precise circumstances was the child brought to your home?

14:04.010 --> 14:07.116
Is there anyone here willing to disclose anything

14:07.180 --> 14:09.126
approximating the truth in this matter?

14:12.719 --> 14:14.221
Hold her steady.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.492
- Don't stomp on it.
- I'm not.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.796
It's not a cockroach. Just easy.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.827
Easy.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.803
Okay, pull right in here.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.805
Good. Yeah.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.849
Who's he?

14:38.077 --> 14:39.420
Guy who works for us.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.822
I've got to go over something with him.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.191
So he runs the place?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.566
- What?
- I smell smoke.

14:54.193 --> 14:55.900
That's you. That's how you smell.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.271
Your mother was very clear on this.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.602
A friend of mine borrowed my coat. He smokes.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.873
- What's his name?
- Henry.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.109
And he borrows coats?

15:06.205 --> 15:07.946
What, is he an orphan?

15:09.509 --> 15:11.546
No, no. You stay.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.353
Couple of minutes. And, uh, button up.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.953
It's how you wear it at school.

15:16.048 --> 15:20.087
Well, you're not at school and you're not coming home with a cold, so...

15:21.888 --> 15:22.889
I got it.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.368
Where'd this giant come from?

15:40.973 --> 15:42.384
Stan.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.447
Why are we seeing each other?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.546
Afternoon, Eli.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.421
- You know Agent Knox.
- Yeah.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.658
No, do I?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.787
He's here a month already.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.956
He didn't make an impression. What do you want from me?

15:55.054 --> 15:56.624
Introduce yourself again.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.464
- Warren Knox, sir.
- There he is.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.766
You see him, I don't want you getting scared.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.967
Mick, we squaring up or not?

16:04.063 --> 16:05.633
I'm involved in this now, Elmer.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.904
Look, I don't need all these people around, hmm?

16:08.334 --> 16:10.075
Why don't you two go over there and get acquainted?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.249
You mean me?

16:13.573 --> 16:15.314
Yes, sir. Pardon.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.082
I guess my time's not worth anything.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.020
You had the problem in Brigantine.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.495
I took care of that.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.997
Which was above and beyond.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.295
I told him you had to sign off.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.961
I want us to go on helping each other.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.868
There's a limit, Stan.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.098
- You get me?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:38.197 --> 16:39.540
I can say the same to you.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.549
You know, I sure could use some law enforcement.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.453
- For what?
- Piney bastards keep robbing my garage.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.554
We don't handle auto theft.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.720
I got 1,000 gallons of whiskey in there.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.024
What would you want us to do?

17:00.119 --> 17:01.189
Don't you catch bootleggers?

17:01.621 --> 17:03.328
Not for other bootleggers.

17:03.489 --> 17:08.632
Well, I got a surprise for the next fox in the henhouse, tell you that much.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.332
What surprise?

17:12.464 --> 17:14.672
Back door, pulley,

17:15.367 --> 17:16.642
shotgun.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.840
- A booby trap?
- I didn't say it.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.679
- Look, Mr...
- Borst.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.718
- Mr. Borst, those kinds of methods...
- Agent Knox.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.546
Sir.

17:29.181 --> 17:31.252
Our inspection is concluded.

17:36.756 --> 17:40.568
Ladies, welcome to the Cicero Quilting Society.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.936
Would you be so kind as to come this way?

17:43.029 --> 17:46.909
Now! Let's go. Hoof it. Come on.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.672
- Give you a hand, darling?
- Some manners, huh?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.577
Couldn't even get my makeup.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.911
We'll send somebody back, all right?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.577
<i>I got myself a brand-new totsy</i>

17:55.675 --> 17:57.848
<i>I'm her hotsy, she's my totsy</i>

17:58.277 --> 18:00.518
<i>Everything is hotsy-totsy now</i>

18:00.913 --> 18:04.588
<i>I say, all I did was pop the question...</i>

18:04.684 --> 18:07.631
- Quit shoving.
- They're pushing from behind.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.136
I left a handbag.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.432
Tell my brother. He'll fetch that, too.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.802
- Come on, giddyup.
- Oh!

18:16.896 --> 18:20.434
Yes, sir, we certainly do. Coming right up.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.139
Same old boobs and boozehounds.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.445
We got shipped over from the Deuces for this?

18:26.606 --> 18:29.416
Hey, the ceilings the same. That's all you'll be looking at.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.553
Here you go, gentlemen. Plenty to choose from. Dive right in.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.083
Alphonse.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.463
Whatever it is, Ralphie, we blame it on you.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.728
See the paper today?

18:45.992 --> 18:47.630
Woodrow Wilson croaked.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.968
Who even knew he was still around?

18:50.062 --> 18:51.564
He means the local skinny, Al.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.144
The idea was we don't have these problems.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.611
That reporter, he's a Bolshie type.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.977
No one cares what he writes.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.107
I might. I might care.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.083
- What'd he write?
- Ralphie, go outside, huh?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.245
Keep an eye on things.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.355
Let them run who they want. It don't matter.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.451
We got Jumping Joe Klenha here.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.964
- All sewed up, right?
- Tight as a drum, gents.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.500
Could always throw him down the stairs again.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.968
Oh, no, no. That was just, uh, high spirits.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.972
I've never hugged a mayor before.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.838
- Talks about you, John.
- I know that, Ralph. I read it.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.207
"Chicago crime boss Johnny Torrio has expanded his reach

19:28.300 --> 19:31.838
"to include bootlegging, gambling, and prostitution

19:31.937 --> 19:35.350
"with the cheerful assistance of our Cicero boosters."

19:35.441 --> 19:36.476
Now who could that be?

19:36.542 --> 19:39.853
"Torrio could be found rusticating at our Hawthorne Inn,

19:39.945 --> 19:43.654
"exerting control through the rough justice of his fact...

19:46.619 --> 19:48.360
- "Fac..."
- Factotum.

19:48.454 --> 19:51.731
- Fat whosis? - "Factotum Alphonse..."

19:52.124 --> 19:53.068
Frank, look.

19:53.159 --> 19:56.163
- What?
- Nothing, it's just, uh...

19:56.228 --> 19:58.708
"Alphonse Caponi."

19:58.798 --> 20:00.641
Sounds like a real no-account.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.977
He gets my fucking name wrong?

20:11.377 --> 20:13.482
<i>A Few Moments with Eddie Cantor.</i>

20:13.546 --> 20:15.583
I tell some jokes, a couple of songs.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.189
- Which ones? <i>- The Dumber They Come...</i>

20:18.250 --> 20:19.888
Absolutely sidesplitting.

20:19.985 --> 20:21.987
There's a doctor standing by with catgut at every showing.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.700
To sew people up from laughing?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.199
It's quite amazing.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.500
You hear everything just like he was right in front of you.

20:30.329 --> 20:31.740
He is right in front of me.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.442
But this is a movie.

20:33.532 --> 20:35.443
Somehow that makes it seem more real.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.247
If that makes any sense.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.907
It does when you say it.

20:40.005 --> 20:42.542
- We've got a rehearsal, pumpkin.
- Not till 4:00.

20:42.608 --> 20:45.111
You know what the Scouts say, "Be prepared."

20:45.211 --> 20:46.884
So does my gynecologist.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.356
But truthfully, kiddo...

20:50.416 --> 20:52.555
I'll see that she gets to the church on time, Eddie.

20:54.353 --> 20:57.266
Take a cab. It's safer.

21:10.636 --> 21:11.876
You own this?

21:11.937 --> 21:14.816
Mr. White does. I just like the atmosphere.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.047
You know Owney Madden?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.417
I've heard of him.

21:18.477 --> 21:19.979
He runs the Cotton Club.

21:20.479 --> 21:21.787
You go up to Harlem?

21:21.881 --> 21:24.054
When someone takes me.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.993
I expect that happens pretty often.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.166
He didn't want me to meet you.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.328
- Owney Madden?
- Mr. Cantor.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.096
He said you're dangerous.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.740
Is it true?

21:38.798 --> 21:40.675
If you think so, you'd better hightail it.

21:40.766 --> 21:44.077
Will something bad happen if I stay?

21:44.904 --> 21:46.906
Heads up, ladies. Heads up.

21:47.940 --> 21:51.353
This is where I spend most of my time.

21:52.912 --> 21:56.792
A retreat' you might call it.

21:56.916 --> 22:01.456
Not the biggest room in the house, but the one I like best.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.862
Looks out over the lawn.

22:07.993 --> 22:11.372
And, of course, en suite facilities.

22:11.463 --> 22:14.376
One of 12, including a Roman bath.

22:14.466 --> 22:15.774
Lot of upkeep.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.542
It was built during the Great Age.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.178
It's waiting for a man.

22:20.506 --> 22:24.147
The right man to bring it back to life.

22:26.111 --> 22:29.684
Cotillions with full orchestras.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.693
- Ermine muffs on winter nights.
- Hmm.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.024
You're quite the scene painter.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.196
I'm just describing the possibilities.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.633
Mmm-hmm.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.036
Well, something to think about.

22:42.127 --> 22:44.903
And that's what I'm going to let you do.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.704
For a minute.

23:15.361 --> 23:17.341
Well?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.673
What's the verdict?

23:20.733 --> 23:24.340
I guess I, uh, have to ask how much?

23:24.503 --> 23:27.382
It's not really the amount, is it?

23:27.439 --> 23:28.713
It's what you get for it.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.287
But it's still a number.

23:35.781 --> 23:36.885
Thirty.

23:38.851 --> 23:42.856
If you want me to put it in my mouth, it's another 10.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.205
Mr. Werner?

23:52.298 --> 23:53.606
Sir?

23:53.699 --> 23:55.303
Yes, Florence?

23:55.401 --> 23:58.143
- Will you need anything else?
- No.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.875
You have a good evening.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.748
I put the present on your desk.

24:01.807 --> 24:05.084
Right in front of me. Thank you.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.215
You just need to sign the card.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.887
Well, good night, then.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.170
Pretty sure these are roller skates.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.079
You have children?

24:33.405 --> 24:34.907
No?

24:39.979 --> 24:42.585
I'm a...

24:43.749 --> 24:46.127
A middleman.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.131
That's all.

24:49.588 --> 24:51.124
I take orders from Milwaukee.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.761
I don't ask questions.

24:56.295 --> 24:59.538
I call a number' they do the rest.

24:59.631 --> 25:03.773
If someone gets hurt, that's not my...

25:08.474 --> 25:10.784
You're doing this for money.

25:12.778 --> 25:15.156
$5,000 in that safe.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.886
Take it.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.555
Walk away. <i>I'll</i> never say a word.

25:21.653 --> 25:22.688
Ru just...

25:28.727 --> 25:30.707
You don't know me.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.469
You don't know anything about me.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.808
I know you're gonna die.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.047
Can I at least...

25:59.591 --> 26:01.867
This is who you want.

26:01.927 --> 26:04.601
His name, his address.

26:04.696 --> 26:06.835
He runs things.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.514
Why?

26:33.725 --> 26:36.899
<i>Fight, Temple, fight on</i>

26:37.229 --> 26:39.766
<i>Fight with all your might</i>

26:39.865 --> 26:42.573
<i>Fight for the Cherry and While</i>

26:42.634 --> 26:44.944
<i>Keep our colors high</i>

26:45.037 --> 26:47.881
<i>Roll the bah and hit the line</i>

26:47.940 --> 26:50.580
<i>All the Temple stars will shine</i>

26:50.709 --> 26:52.985
<i>Skill and courage win the game</i>

26:53.078 --> 26:55.115
<i>Fight on, Temple, fight...</i>

26:59.318 --> 27:00.888
Then you go beat people up?

27:01.286 --> 27:02.765
Uncle Nucky?

27:02.888 --> 27:04.162
They sing it at football games.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.326
How often do you go to those?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.460
Once in a while with the fellas.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.937
Instead of studying?

27:11.663 --> 27:13.438
Didn't he get an A in accounting?

27:13.499 --> 27:15.308
It's geography of commerce.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.311
Answer the question.

27:17.402 --> 27:18.813
Who are these other fellas?

27:20.139 --> 27:23.951
There's, uh, Flitch and Dobby.

27:24.009 --> 27:26.455
Tip. Henry.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.082
Everyone calls him Bucket.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.149
These are boys or ponies?

27:30.249 --> 27:32.024
They're all a lot of fun.

27:32.117 --> 27:35.360
- Are they smokers?
- I don't know.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.797
You spend so much time with them.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.199
- None of us smoke.
- I don't want you picking that up.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.532
Me? He's like a chimney.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.004
Hey, this is your mother.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.438
Maybe you forgot that now you're so popular.

27:46.598 --> 27:47.599
I haven't forgotten.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.373
Then what do you say?

27:52.037 --> 27:54.881
- Ma.
- Yes?

28:00.979 --> 28:02.822
I love you.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.292
Well, I should hope so.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.125
- You have to go?
- I do.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.892
But this was lovely as always.

28:14.293 --> 28:15.328
Fight for the Cherry and the White.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.230
YES, sir.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.467
- I'll call you later.
- Good night, Uncle Nucky.

28:18.564 --> 28:20.373
Bye, Nucky.

28:21.500 --> 28:22.808
Help me clean.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.144
Let's go. Everybody help Mommy.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.410
Take that. Take your plates.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.150
Uncle Nucky.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.246
Willie, put a coat on.

28:33.478 --> 28:36.186
Ma's checking it for tobacco stains.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.091
Should have stayed in Philadelphia for the break.

28:38.483 --> 28:41.191
You need to see your family. And they need to see you.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.597
Why? I show up and my dad

28:43.689 --> 28:45.999
just tells me the things I'm not supposed to do.

28:46.191 --> 28:47.727
What do you think he should be telling you?

28:48.727 --> 28:50.934
Business. How it works.

28:52.331 --> 28:53.571
Which business is that?

28:54.833 --> 28:56.335
Ours.

28:58.337 --> 29:02.012
There's what I do, what your father helps me with.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.678
It's nothing for you to worry about.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.184
I'm not worried. I just think that...

29:06.245 --> 29:09.055
You came through for me, Will. I haven't forgotten.

29:09.681 --> 29:12.093
What you need to do now is get the degree.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.754
We're all counting on it, okay?

29:14.453 --> 29:16.797
- Sure.
- Keep earning A's.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.591
And anything you want to get off your chest,

29:19.691 --> 29:20.726
you could always come to me.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.474
I do smoke.

29:28.634 --> 29:31.615
I know. I went to college for a year.

29:31.703 --> 29:33.808
It's where I picked up all my bad habits.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.157
Alphonse Capone.

29:50.055 --> 29:52.126
Alphonse Capone.

29:52.224 --> 29:55.831
Seriously, how hard is that, huh?

29:58.497 --> 30:00.568
The reporter's name is St. John.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.839
- So?
- So he's probably a pilgrim or something.

30:02.934 --> 30:06.279
- He's not gonna know.
- Spelled Torrio right.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.750
Yeah, well, people heard of Johnny.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.353
That's my point.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.254
You screwy?

30:15.314 --> 30:18.761
People heard of Johnny, good. Let him take the heat.

30:18.817 --> 30:19.921
Nobody should know you.

30:20.619 --> 30:21.825
What are you saying, Frank?

30:21.920 --> 30:23.957
In this line of work, the fewer people that know who you are...

30:24.022 --> 30:26.366
- I was here first, huh?
- I what?

30:26.458 --> 30:27.869
Just saying, I was here first.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.336
You understand what he's getting at?

30:29.428 --> 30:32.204
And I bring you both out 'cause that's what a brother does.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.504
And I bought this house that we're living in.

30:34.599 --> 30:37.443
And I run the Inn and the Ship.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.879
And that's not nothing, Frank.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.649
Okay? I'm not nothing.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.287
I'm nobody's "fatotus."

30:48.313 --> 30:50.657
Al Capone with an "E."

30:50.716 --> 30:51.888
With an "E."

30:54.653 --> 30:58.191
- Hey, Snork.
- Don't call me that.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.133
- Snorky.
- Don't call me that, Frank.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.729
Come on. No, really.

31:02.961 --> 31:04.133
You're special.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.000
You are a very special boy.

31:07.132 --> 31:10.170
Oh, fuck off, you...

31:10.235 --> 31:11.509
Keep at it, Al.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.538
Get off.

31:13.638 --> 31:14.810
Don't take no guff.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.353
- Om
- Atta boy.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.315
No, no, Ma. They're horsing around.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.559
What?

31:33.992 --> 31:36.939
I don't have time for that.

31:37.028 --> 31:40.168
I have to be back in 40 minutes. I couldn't have been clearer.

31:51.376 --> 31:55.051
Is this considered a good hotel in this part of town?

31:55.180 --> 31:57.456
- You don't like it?
- It's disgusting.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.722
Another.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.191
Please.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.301
Is your boss a smart man?

32:09.394 --> 32:11.874
Mr. White? Knows his way around.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.967
He should be careful.

32:14.065 --> 32:15.601
Dickie's not that honest.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.878
He steals from the acts, he steals from the owners.

32:19.871 --> 32:21.748
He's a nasty little thief.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.416
He's your husband.

32:23.475 --> 32:26.888
I like to say bad things about him.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.152
It's not very nice, is it?

32:29.247 --> 32:31.727
For someone in a hurry, you talk a lot.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.608
Don't touch my hair.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.865
Is that how you fuck, huh?

33:10.956 --> 33:13.527
Is that how you do it?

33:13.625 --> 33:17.437
Fuck you. Fuck you, you fuck.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.776
Swirl that cock. Swirl it.

33:20.098 --> 33:21.304
Like that.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.710
Like that. Like that.

33:23.802 --> 33:24.837
Oh, like that!

33:27.005 --> 33:28.848
Christ, you're fucking me!

33:28.940 --> 33:32.012
- Hi.
- Motherfucker!

33:32.110 --> 33:34.852
Look at this.

33:34.946 --> 33:36.448
Look what's happening now.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.487
- Dickie, he made me.
- No, no, no.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.552
- He said he'd drive me to our hotel.
- That ain't what happened.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.360
Hey, hey. You know what?

33:44.189 --> 33:46.191
Sit down right there.

33:46.291 --> 33:49.864
Go on. Whoa! What are you doing?

33:49.961 --> 33:51.702
Pulling up my pants.

33:51.796 --> 33:54.743
I just said sit, nothing else.

34:00.705 --> 34:01.809
Tell me what happened.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.754
- I can't.
- Shh.

34:07.312 --> 34:08.552
I know you're upset.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.755
I got in his car.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.655
While I was going over the contracts?

34:14.753 --> 34:15.731
Yes, it must have been.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.926
And then he drove away from the boardwalk to...

34:19.391 --> 34:21.268
To the Negro part of town.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.498
- He threatened me with a straight razor.
- I don't carry no...

34:23.562 --> 34:26.168
My wife is talking. She's explaining.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.900
And you just interrupt.

34:27.998 --> 34:29.909
Look, uh, Dickie. How about...

34:30.001 --> 34:32.413
We're not on a first name basis.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.949
We're not friends.

34:34.039 --> 34:37.043
You're fucking my wife and you interrupt.

34:37.108 --> 34:38.518
And, you know, I go around

34:38.577 --> 34:42.786
and I spend a lot of time with all of you.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.725
Do business, eat your food,

34:45.784 --> 34:48.525
put money in your pockets.

34:48.687 --> 34:51.531
And I love the music. I really do.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.567
But in the end, you know what always happens?

34:54.693 --> 34:58.539
- Well, I think...
- You act like the fucking niggers that you are.

34:59.631 --> 35:00.701
Huh?

35:01.399 --> 35:03.072
Isn't that right?

35:14.813 --> 35:16.224
Isn't it?

35:17.716 --> 35:18.717
Yes.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.091
Yes what?

35:22.220 --> 35:24.222
Yes, boss.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.233
Go on.

35:34.432 --> 35:35.502
What?

35:35.600 --> 35:37.637
Act like a nigger.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.075
She's waiting.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.533
I'll put your brains on the wall.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.104
Let go of your trousers.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.546
It's all just some fun.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.478
There's no changing you people.

37:20.338 --> 37:22.113
He said expect the drop-off around 11:00.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.386
Twenty after already.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.352
I guess criminals aren't very punctual.

37:27.011 --> 37:30.254
Perhaps it's why they have trouble being productive members of society.

37:30.348 --> 37:33.352
Maybe your informant was just lying to you.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.854
He gave a strong impression of sincerity.

37:38.456 --> 37:41.096
I wouldn't mind an arrest or two under my belt.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.138
That's the way to do it, right?

37:43.228 --> 37:46.368
Keep Supervisor Elliot from getting too nosy?

37:47.198 --> 37:49.109
The hell they give me tea for?

37:49.200 --> 37:51.202
That should be mine. Sorry.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.205
I haven't touched it.

37:59.911 --> 38:04.053
That farmer fella today over at Mr. Doyle's?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.595
Rely-poly Otis.

38:06.718 --> 38:07.788
I thought his name was Elmer.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.126
They're all Otis to me.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.290
Huh.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.130
Anyhow, he's got some problems.

38:13.224 --> 38:15.898
- Who does?
- Elm...

38:15.994 --> 38:17.632
Otis.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.266
Awful lot of liquor in his garage.

38:20.331 --> 38:21.742
And kind of funny, I guess...

38:21.800 --> 38:23.780
He asked us 10 help him keep tabs on it.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.977
- This was to you?
- I couldn't shut him up.

38:29.073 --> 38:31.246
Not to mention that bankroll he was toting.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.311
That was quite the spectacle.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.789
He asked the Treasury agents.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.259
Oh, boy. I mean...

38:39.083 --> 38:40.824
I mean, just think about that.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.966
You know what you've done here?

38:50.161 --> 38:53.108
I signed contracts with that man.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.871
He connected in New York.

38:55.967 --> 39:00.211
And I work on him so that club can turn some scratch.

39:00.438 --> 39:03.681
Make him my friend inch by inch.

39:05.543 --> 39:09.889
And you go let loose a crap all over it for 15 minute worth of jelly.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.656
'Cause you the fucking sweetback, huh?

39:14.719 --> 39:17.131
What you got to say for yourself?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.691
She a devil, that's all.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.532
And she stuck the bottle up his neck?

39:52.657 --> 39:55.228
Jesus Christ, his head's practically off.

39:55.326 --> 39:56.327
He earned it.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.898
Right now I don't care what your side is, okay?

40:00.164 --> 40:01.165
Who was he?

40:01.933 --> 40:03.913
Dickie Pastor.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.539
Booking agent. Bring acts around the club.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.343
Worked for Owney Madden.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.359
- And the girl?
- Climb out the window.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.260
I guess you were too busy.

40:20.351 --> 40:21.762
Anybody know he came here?

40:21.853 --> 40:24.299
Night man let him in. Couldn't say who else.

40:27.692 --> 40:28.898
Slip him out the back way.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.370
Yeah. I got a place.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.102
We find that girl.

40:33.197 --> 40:35.700
She ain't got no coat, no shoes, no money.

40:36.768 --> 40:37.769
Then what?

40:38.036 --> 40:39.709
Just take care of it.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.388
Make sure people stay quiet here.

41:01.759 --> 41:03.397
That on you.

41:15.340 --> 41:16.944
Sweetback.

41:18.242 --> 41:19.687
Sweetback.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.757
The hell you leave the door open for?

41:22.080 --> 41:23.753
Letting all the cold in.

41:39.464 --> 41:41.808
- Don't slam it.
- You heard him now.

41:48.272 --> 41:49.774
There a shoe right there.

41:57.281 --> 41:59.887
Nuh-uh. Don't be throwing it now.

42:55.606 --> 42:57.244
Well?

42:57.341 --> 42:59.343
What's the verdict?

42:59.510 --> 43:01.547
You're asking a lot.

43:01.612 --> 43:03.285
I promise you, it's worth it.

43:03.381 --> 43:05.725
Ah, I don't doubt it.

43:05.783 --> 43:08.263
Still...

43:08.352 --> 43:10.923
Is there anything I can do to persuade you?

43:12.090 --> 43:15.196
It's just so much bigger than anything I would need.

43:15.693 --> 43:17.764
And, uh...

43:17.862 --> 43:18.863
What?

43:18.930 --> 43:21.376
Well, it's none of my business, but...

43:23.034 --> 43:24.775
I don't think you really want to sell it.

43:24.869 --> 43:27.145
I assure you I do.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.375
Hmm.

43:29.207 --> 43:30.982
It's just the way that you talk about it.

43:31.075 --> 43:33.419
I know what that's like, leaving something behind

43:33.478 --> 43:36.550
that's part of you, finding that courage.

43:36.647 --> 43:39.218
In any case, I only need something for a few months.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.260
Beautiful woodwork.

43:42.453 --> 43:43.454
Mr. Phillips.

43:43.554 --> 43:44.931
Mmm, Roy.

43:45.556 --> 43:47.968
What brings you to our little town?

43:49.127 --> 43:50.128
Piggly Wiggly.

43:50.761 --> 43:52.297
- Huh?
- It's a supermarket chain.

43:52.396 --> 43:55.240
We're expanding into the northeast and I'm here to set it up.

43:56.100 --> 43:58.171
Well, that must be hard on your wife.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.742
Well, as I said,

44:01.806 --> 44:03.012
leaving things behind.

44:05.676 --> 44:08.418
Cotillions and ermine muffs.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.322
That would suit you well.

44:11.415 --> 44:12.485
Do you really think so?

44:13.417 --> 44:15.761
I'm a bit of a dreamer at heart.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.660
I'm sorry. I have another place to look at.

44:21.659 --> 44:22.660
Where?

44:22.760 --> 44:25.331
- Bungalow Park.
- Oh.

44:25.429 --> 44:26.635
You don't want to live there.

44:26.764 --> 44:27.868
Hmm.

44:29.634 --> 44:32.638
Can't trust a realtor now, can you?

44:36.107 --> 44:37.814
Say, you wouldn't consider...

44:37.942 --> 44:39.046
Uh...

44:39.710 --> 44:41.781
I seem to be a bit at sea here.

44:41.846 --> 44:44.224
I could use a knowledgeable companion.

44:44.949 --> 44:48.726
Well, I'm certainly that.

45:13.978 --> 45:14.979
Factotum.

45:15.913 --> 45:17.017
Yes?

45:17.715 --> 45:20.423
That's a servant or something.

45:20.685 --> 45:22.858
Whatever you tell them to do.

45:25.156 --> 45:26.191
I looked it up.

45:27.491 --> 45:29.198
How old are you?

45:30.027 --> 45:31.734
Twenty-two.

45:31.929 --> 45:33.567
Making a name for yourself, huh?

45:34.098 --> 45:35.168
I'm reporting the truth.

45:35.766 --> 45:38.406
Oh, the truth?

45:51.282 --> 45:53.193
Read that aloud.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.696
One letter at a time.

46:01.525 --> 46:06.531
"C-A-P-0-N...

46:10.534 --> 46:11.638
"E."

46:16.207 --> 46:18.278
Now you know.

46:47.138 --> 46:51.484
Against the sable sky of perfumed night,

46:51.575 --> 46:55.580
it's the darkest gems that shine most bright.

46:56.914 --> 46:59.326
Ladies and gentlemen,

46:59.817 --> 47:01.626
the Onyx Girls.

47:07.258 --> 47:10.432
That's my favorite color!

47:10.494 --> 47:12.303
Bring on the dancing girls.

48:20.197 --> 48:22.837
She's white, half-naked. What's the difficulty?

48:22.900 --> 48:25.073
Maybe she froze in a doorway somewhere.

48:25.169 --> 48:26.546
Scamper off to New York.

48:26.670 --> 48:28.206
You know, you missed your calling.

48:28.339 --> 48:30.341
- How's that?
- You should have been a detective.

48:30.408 --> 48:31.580
- I ain't the one what...
- Dunn.

48:34.211 --> 48:36.122
Go check the bar.

48:43.087 --> 48:45.567
Man stood for you when it counted.

48:45.623 --> 48:47.796
He need riding, I'll be the one on his back.

48:47.892 --> 48:51.567
Just so we're clear, I don't want anyone else's grief.

48:51.629 --> 48:53.631
You ain't gonna get it.

49:06.777 --> 49:09.053
I thought you'd abandoned me.

49:09.113 --> 49:10.956
I wouldn't dare.

49:11.048 --> 49:12.459
What do you think of the show?

49:12.550 --> 49:14.791
Deliciously primitive.

49:14.885 --> 49:16.728
Bring out the beast in you?

49:19.290 --> 49:21.896
You're just gonna have to wait and see.

49:37.741 --> 49:39.482
What do you suppose he's doing in there?

49:39.577 --> 49:41.648
How should I know?

49:41.745 --> 49:44.316
Well, why don't I knock on the door and announce our presence?

49:44.415 --> 49:46.759
And then what?

49:46.817 --> 49:49.991
We make it clear to Mr. Borst that in order to provide

49:50.087 --> 49:53.000
the protection he wants, we require a certain amount...

49:53.090 --> 49:55.434
We're just gonna blow this hillbilly over.

50:09.874 --> 50:12.787
- It's a 50-50 split.
- Is that standard?

50:13.277 --> 50:14.551
Just draw your weapon and follow me.

50:19.717 --> 50:21.560
Come on. Don't worry.

50:21.652 --> 50:22.687
We're the law.

50:22.786 --> 50:24.959
It's not that.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.865
I just don't see well in the dark.

50:26.957 --> 50:28.698
How'd you make the Bureau, bub?

50:28.792 --> 50:31.898
My uncle is in the same Elks Lodge as our congressman.

50:33.130 --> 50:35.667
Just stand here.

50:35.733 --> 50:37.735
Don't bump into anything.

50:37.835 --> 50:40.315
Watch the front, then come when I signal.

51:15.739 --> 51:17.275
Mr. Borst.

52:11.428 --> 52:13.135
I'll call it in, sir.

52:13.230 --> 52:15.574
Soon as I gel a grip on myself.

52:16.967 --> 52:20.312
I don't mind saying, this has all got me pretty rattled.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.117
Can we make a deal?

52:29.179 --> 52:31.090
What'd you have in mind?

52:31.148 --> 52:34.493
I won't tell Cantor if you don't.

52:34.585 --> 52:36.428
<i>- The Dumber They Come.</i>

52:37.921 --> 52:39.958
He's a doll, though.

52:40.124 --> 52:42.434
Learn something new every day.

52:44.261 --> 52:45.797
Is this really where you live?

52:46.630 --> 52:48.268
It suits my needs.

52:50.601 --> 52:52.979
But that's how it is with a bachelor.

52:54.772 --> 52:55.944
Lonely?

52:57.141 --> 52:58.552
Now and then.

53:02.179 --> 53:03.817
I have a confession.

53:05.883 --> 53:08.159
I've wanted to meet you for a long time.

53:09.286 --> 53:10.390
Why?

53:11.488 --> 53:13.627
Everyone talked about you and Billie.

53:15.292 --> 53:16.794
What did they say?

53:16.960 --> 53:17.961
Well...

53:20.230 --> 53:22.506
How else could she star on Broadway?

53:41.318 --> 53:43.320
Just give me a minute.

53:56.500 --> 54:00.209
Mr. Thompson has asked me to say he has been called away.

54:00.671 --> 54:02.082
He just said he was coming back.

54:02.172 --> 54:04.015
But he is not.

54:06.009 --> 54:07.852
Son of a goddamn bitch.

54:08.045 --> 54:09.046
Pardon me?

54:09.379 --> 54:10.756
What am I supposed to do?

54:10.848 --> 54:12.885
You are supposed to leave.

54:59.062 --> 55:00.234
You didn't have to get up.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.834
I was not yet asleep.

56:50.841 --> 56:52.115
Emma.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.889
I've come home.

56:59.305 --> 57:05.459
