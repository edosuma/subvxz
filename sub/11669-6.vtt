- Actually, would you mind?

00:10.777 --> 00:13.302
I just... I don't wanna draw attention.
But it's really nice to meet you.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.178
Meet you? I just want a photo.

00:16.616 --> 00:19.779
Wow, you should really be
nicer to your fans, jeez.

Yes, it is... I didn't see it,

00:32.165 --> 00:33.655

happy birthday this summer... Okay.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.387
That wasn't funny.

01:34.994 --> 01:36.985
All right, well, I really have to run, thank you.

01:37.063 --> 01:38.758
It wasn't good, can I take another one?

01:38.832 --> 01:40.197
Yeah, here, let me do it.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.231
You're not cute.

01:47.006 --> 01:48.667
I'm just like you, a piece of shit.

01:49.742 --> 01:50.766
Okay, thanks.

I hate to be that girl, I'm so that girl

01:52.745 --> 01:55.145
right now, though, but, um, can, um...

01:55.215 --> 01:57.410
- You want a picture?
- No, can I have $100?

01:57.484 --> 01:58.644
I am such a big fan.

01:58.718 --> 02:00.481
I, like, loved you since <i>Chelsea Lately.</i>

02:00.553 --> 02:01.645
I'm not on that show.

What, do you think you're
better than everyone else now?

- Is that it?
- No.

- Yes.
- Have I changed?

02:48.968 --> 02:51.801
I would say the only change is, uh...

02:51.871 --> 02:53.566
The quality of life has gone way up.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.267
We used to go to IHOP and shit.

17:46.331 --> 17:47.764
First of all, you saw <i>The Revenant.</i>

17:47.833 --> 17:50.301
- (LAUGHING) Stop it!
- No.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.734
Yes, I saw <i>The Revenant.</i>
That's all we talked about.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.534
Well, I have not heard yet.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.767
Please, you're a movie reviewer.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.104
Please review <i>The Revenant.</i>

17:58.177 --> 18:01.544
All right, I watched it at home illegally.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.441
So it was awesome.

18:03.515 --> 18:04.504
- Now what happens?
- Okay.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.608
All right, the bear, hello.

18:06.685 --> 18:10.121
Yeah, Leonardo Dicaprio has a bear attack,

18:10.189 --> 18:13.056
and Tom Hardy left him for dead.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.657
And, yadda, yadda, yadda,

18:15.727 --> 18:18.161
<i>The Revenant</i> is, uh,

18:18.230 --> 18:20.664
comes back and then kills Tom Hardy.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.222
(LAUGHING)

18:22.301 --> 18:25.031
Okay, what do you think
the movie <i>Carol</i> is about?

18:25.804 --> 18:28.204
Well, I thought it's about lesbians.
(LAUGHING)

18:28.307 --> 18:29.638
You don't have to whisper it.

18:29.708 --> 18:32.836
Like, girls are straight-up
allowed to just go at it now.

18:32.911 --> 18:34.845
- Yeah, I know.
- What is the most recent movie you saw?

18:34.913 --> 18:37.609
I... Two nights ago,
we watched <i>The Night Before</i>

18:37.683 --> 18:39.344
- with Seth Rogen.
- Review it.

18:39.418 --> 18:40.942
- I will review it.
- Do it.

18:41.019 --> 18:42.714
- I fell asleep.
- Jess, that's...

18:42.788 --> 18:44.483
(LAUGHING)

18:44.556 --> 18:46.717
Review <i>Mockingjay 2.</i>

18:46.792 --> 18:47.884
Okay.

18:48.627 --> 18:52.393
I have a severe crush on, um, Cressida.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.489
- Like, a hard crush.
- What's Cressida?

18:54.566 --> 18:56.932
Um, what's her name? Natalie Dormer.

18:57.002 --> 18:59.163
- Oh, oh, her name's Cressida in the... Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:59.238 --> 19:01.069
So, okay, so the review so far
is about Cressida.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.334
Forget about the movie,
forget about the movie.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.500
But that's what we're doing,
we're reviewing the movie, that's...

19:04.610 --> 19:07.545
But before that... At like the premiere of it.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.343
First explain, how you got invited

19:10.415 --> 19:12.508
to the <i>Mockingjay 2 premiere?</i>

19:12.584 --> 19:13.573
Tell me the plot.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.586
You could definitely tell
that a lot better than me.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.350
Um, okay, well, from what I remember,

19:18.423 --> 19:20.050
we'd been hanging out
with Jennifer Lawrence

19:20.125 --> 19:22.116
for about two hours.

19:22.194 --> 19:26.426
And then out of nowhere,
literally nowhere, you went,

19:26.498 --> 19:30.025
"Jennifer, here's why I should be invited

19:30.102 --> 19:32.900
"to the <i>Mockingjay 2 premiere.</i>

19:32.971 --> 19:34.666
"I read all the books.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.799
- "I'm a fan!"
- Do I sound like that?

19:36.875 --> 19:38.240
Is that what I sound like?

19:38.944 --> 19:40.206
Exactly like that.

19:40.279 --> 19:41.439
(LAUGHING)

19:41.513 --> 19:43.003
So, we saw...

19:43.081 --> 19:44.708
- We went to the <i>Mockingjay 2 premiere.
- Yes.</i>

19:44.783 --> 19:49.413
We were at a bar and shoving our...
Like, nobody would eat.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.388
We were invited to the upstairs movie thing.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.946
The pre... Yeah, yeah.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.686
And I'm at the bar
and Natalie Dormer walks up.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.387
And I've gotten good with, like, celebrities.

19:56.461 --> 19:57.894
- You're very cool with them now.
- I've gotten better.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.828
- You've gotten better.
- I've gotten better.

19:59.898 --> 20:02.992
Okay, I'm just remembering
at the, um, premiere

20:03.068 --> 20:04.968
of <i>Trainwreck</i> when you
went up to Bill Hader going,

20:05.037 --> 20:06.834
"Do your gay character!"

20:07.372 --> 20:09.567
- He loved that!
- (LAUGHING)

20:09.641 --> 20:10.630
He did.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.006
- Okay, so...
- So, uh...

20:12.077 --> 20:14.409
So for the review is that
you like Natalie Dormer.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.140
And that she was eating next to you at a bar

20:16.215 --> 20:18.115
where you were, like,
literally eating your own body weight.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.048
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, that's it.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.450
Okay, that's the whole... That's the movie!

20:22.521 --> 20:24.682
No, it was good, it was good,
it was good, um...

20:24.756 --> 20:26.724
- I'm trying to remember that.
- (CHUCKLES)

20:26.792 --> 20:28.521
I don't know, um...

20:29.328 --> 20:30.693
Okay, what movie...

20:30.762 --> 20:32.662
- I'm, I'm, I'm blank, I'm blank.
- What movie is...

20:32.731 --> 20:34.892
(LAUGHING) I'm sorry.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.457
No, you're gonna get so many job offers

20:36.535 --> 20:37.763
out of these movie reviews, Jess.

20:38.136 --> 20:39.603
(MUSIC PLAYING)

20:40.839 --> 20:42.306
But I thought you loved ferrets.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.767
(AMY LAUGHING)

20:45.377 --> 20:48.210
God, this is so fucking embarrassing!

20:49.381 --> 20:50.905
Fuck you!

20:50.983 --> 20:52.007
Fuck you, Amy!

20:52.084 --> 20:53.176
(SCREAMING)

20:53.252 --> 20:54.719
Oh, my God... (LAUGHING)

21:01.126 --> 21:02.593
WOMAN: <i>So easy.</i>

21:02.661 --> 21:03.821
MAN: <i>Mmm, magic.</i>

21:06.865 --> 21:09.026
- I'm sending it back.
- Oh, God!

21:11.236 --> 21:12.294
AMY: God.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.799
I'm this close to canceling that weekend.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.304
This close.
