THAT ERICH BLUNT MIGHT BE
CINDY STRAUSS' KILLER?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.864
WE USUALLY LOOK AT A VICTIM'S
BEST FRIENDS,

11:30.864 --> 11:32.735
SPOUSE, OR FAMILY MEMBERS.

11:32.735 --> 11:35.390
IN THIS CASE, ONE OF OUR CLUES
WAS THE PRESENCE,

11:35.390 --> 11:38.219
IN PLAIN VIEW,
OF MULTIPLE PHOTOGRAPHS

11:38.219 --> 11:40.917
OF MISS STRAUSS
AND ERICH BLUNT

11:40.917 --> 11:44.399
THAT INDICATED A VERY CLOSE
AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.749
WHAT KIND OF PICTURES
DID YOU SEE?

11:46.749 --> 11:48.795
PICTURES OF THEM SMILING,
THEIR ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER,

11:48.795 --> 11:50.535
LYING IN BED TOGETHER.

11:50.535 --> 11:53.234
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON
YOU SUSPECTED ERICH BLUNT?
NO.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.584
SEVERAL DAYS EARLIER,
I WAS INVESTIGATING

11:55.584 --> 11:58.935
A MURDER OF A 50-YEAR-OLD
PUSHER, KEVIN NEYERS,

11:58.935 --> 12:01.068
IN THE TENDERLOIN DISTRICT.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.070
NOW, IN THE COURSE
OF THIS INVESTIGATION,

12:03.070 --> 12:04.767
MY PARTNER AND I
HAD THE OCCASION

12:04.767 --> 12:07.727
OF INTERVIEWING MR. BLUNT
SEVERAL TIMES.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.555
HOW DID THE DEATH
OF A 50-YEAR-OLD PUSHER

12:10.555 --> 12:12.253
LEAD YOU TO ERICH BLUNT?

12:12.253 --> 12:13.820
ON KEVIN NEYERS' iPAD,

12:13.820 --> 12:16.736
THERE WAS AN E-MAIL
ADDRESSED TO MR. BLUNT.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.086
WHAT DID THIS E-MAIL SAY?

12:19.086 --> 12:24.265
IT ASKED FOR $50,000,
OR HE WOULD, "GO PUBLIC."

12:24.265 --> 12:26.136
AND DID YOU INFER FROM THIS
THAT KEVIN NEYERS

12:26.136 --> 12:27.703
WAS TRYING TO BLACKMAIL
ERICH BLUNT?

12:27.703 --> 12:29.923
I DID, SIR.AND WHEN YOU ASKED
ERICH BLUNT,

12:29.923 --> 12:31.272
WHAT DID HE SAY
ABOUT THIS E-MAIL?

12:31.272 --> 12:34.057
MR. BLUNT SAID HE NEVER RECEIVED
THE E-MAIL

12:34.057 --> 12:36.103
AND THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHO KEVIN NEYERS WAS.

12:36.103 --> 12:39.019
THAT WAS A LIE, WASN'T IT?IT WAS.

12:39.019 --> 12:42.109
MY PARTNER AND I HAD INTERVIEWED
KEVIN NEYERS' IN-LAWS,

12:42.109 --> 12:44.372
JAMES AND BETTY HARBACH.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.200
NOW, THEY HAD
A DECEASED DAUGHTER

12:46.200 --> 12:49.116
WHO HAD A SON
WITH KEVIN NEYERS.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.161
THIS SON WAS ERICH BLUNT.

12:51.161 --> 12:54.295
THE HARBACHS CONFIRMED
THAT BLUNT DID, IN FACT, KNOW

12:54.295 --> 12:56.819
THAT KEVIN NEYERS WAS
HIS BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.126
SO, WHEN ERICH BLUNT
DENIED KNOWING

12:59.126 --> 13:02.433
WHO KEVIN NEYERS WAS,
THAT WAS A LIE.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.652
IT WAS A LIE.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.306
AND THEN,
UPON ASKING HIM AGAIN,

13:05.306 --> 13:06.786
HE LATER ADMITTED THAT

13:06.786 --> 13:09.310
HE DID KNOW KEVIN NEYERS WAS
HIS BIOLOGICAL FATHER

13:09.310 --> 13:11.051
AND THAT HE HAD GIVEN HIM
MONEY.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.835
INSPECTOR, TO RECAP.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.532
YOU FIRST INTERVIEWED
ERICH BLUNT

13:14.532 --> 13:16.534
IN THE MURDER
OF HIS BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

13:16.534 --> 13:18.710
AND THEN AGAIN IN THE DEATH
OF CINDY STRAUSS, CORRECT?

13:18.710 --> 13:20.234
YES, SIR.

13:20.234 --> 13:21.844
DIDN'T YOU FIND THAT
AN ODD COINCIDENCE?

13:21.844 --> 13:24.412
NO, I DO NOT BELIEVE
IN COINCIDENCE, SIR.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.588
DID ERICH BLUNT LIE TO YOU
WHEN YOU QUESTIONED HIM

13:26.588 --> 13:28.851
ABOUT CINDY STRAUSS' DEATH?HE DID.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.505
HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SLEPT
WITH HER

13:30.505 --> 13:32.681
AND THAT HE HADN'T SEEN HER
THE NIGHT SHE WAS --

13:32.681 --> 13:35.292
THE NIGHT SHE DIED.
EXCUSE ME.

13:35.292 --> 13:38.295
AND BOTH THOSE STATEMENTS

13:38.295 --> 13:41.081
WERE PROVED FALSE
BY SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION?

13:41.081 --> 13:43.692
YES, SIR.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.955
I HAVE
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

13:45.955 --> 13:49.350
YOUR WITNESS, MR. DANIELS.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.399
INSPECTOR ENGLISH,
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.924
INSPECTOR, DID YOU EVER CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY

13:57.924 --> 14:01.231
THAT ERICH BLUNT DIDN'T ADMIT
HE KNEW KEVIN NEYERS

14:01.231 --> 14:06.062
BECAUSE HE WAS EMBARRASSED
OR EVEN ASHAMED AT HIS FATHER,

14:06.062 --> 14:08.586
A DRUG ADDICT WHO WAS ALWAYS
ASKING HIM FOR MONEY?

14:08.586 --> 14:10.371
OBJECTION.
IT CALLS FOR SPECULATION.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.938
OVERRULED.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.896
I NEVER GAVE ANY THOUGHT

14:13.896 --> 14:16.594
TO WHAT BLUNT WAS THINKING ABOUT
KEVIN NEYERS.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.773
IS IT CORRECT
THAT YOU DIDN'T PURSUE MR. BLUNT

14:21.773 --> 14:24.037
AS A SUSPECT IN THE DEATH
OF KEVIN NEYERS?

14:24.037 --> 14:25.734
YES, SIR.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.823
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T THINK
HE COMMITTED THE MURDER?

14:27.823 --> 14:29.216
HE HAD AN ALIBI.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.826
HE WAS IN LOS ANGELES
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

14:30.826 --> 14:34.003
SO, YOU KNEW HE COULDN'T HAVE
KILLED MR. NEYERS.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.613
AND, AS IT TURNS OUT,

14:35.613 --> 14:38.573
A DRUG DEALER NAMED CHRIS WALTON
CONFESSED TO THE MURDER

14:38.573 --> 14:40.705
AND IS NOW SERVING HIS SENTENCE
IN SAN QUENTIN.

14:40.705 --> 14:41.532
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

14:41.532 --> 14:43.578
THAT IS RIGHT.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.145
NOW,
IN YOUR EARLIER TESTIMONY,

14:45.145 --> 14:47.887
YOU STATED THAT YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN COINCIDENCE.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.888
IS THAT CORRECT?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.020
THAT IS CORRECT.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.109
SO, WOULDN'T YOU THINK
IT WAS A COINCIDENCE

14:53.109 --> 14:55.198
THAT MR. BLUNT WAS A PERSON
OF INTEREST

14:55.198 --> 14:57.374
IN TWO
HOMICIDE INVESTIGATIONS,

14:57.374 --> 15:00.421
BUT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH EITHER DEATH?

15:00.421 --> 15:02.249
I SUPPOSE SO.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.815
YOU SUPPOSE SO.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.252
DO YOU THINK MR. BLUNT

15:05.252 --> 15:06.688
HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH BOTH DEATHS?

15:06.688 --> 15:08.081
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.343
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
INSPECTOR?

15:09.343 --> 15:11.867
I'M SAYING
THAT THE COMMON DENOMINATOR

15:11.867 --> 15:13.956
IN BOTH DEATHS
IS ERICH BLUNT.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.610
SO, LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT.

15:15.610 --> 15:16.959
YOU SUSPECTED ERICH BLUNT

15:16.959 --> 15:18.787
IN THE MURDER
OF HIS BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

15:18.787 --> 15:21.181
AND BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE
CONFESSED TO THE MURDER,

15:21.181 --> 15:24.097
YOU WERE PREDISPOSED
TO THE BIASED BELIEF

15:24.097 --> 15:25.968
THAT HE MURDERED
CINDY STRAUSS.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.796
OBJECTION.
HE'S BADGERING THE WITNESS.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.931
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

15:45.901 --> 15:48.643
IN THIS SCENARIO, SHE TRIPS
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.862
SHE STUMBLES,
FALLS TO THE LANDING HERE,

15:50.862 --> 15:54.040
WHERE SHE CRASHES INTO THE VASE
SET INTO THE WALL NICHE.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.085
THE VASE SHATTERS ON IMPACT.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.000
SHE FALLS DOWN
THE LOWER SET OF STAIRS,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.264
LANDING HEAD FIRST, WITH
HER UPPER BODY ON THE GROUND

16:01.264 --> 16:03.571
AND HER LOWER BODY
SPRAWLED AWKWARDLY

16:03.571 --> 16:06.400
ON THE BOTTOM FOUR STAIRS.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.968
BASED ON THIS SIMULATION,
IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION,

16:08.968 --> 16:10.317
WAS IT POSSIBLE
FOR THIS FALL

16:10.317 --> 16:12.623
TO HAVE CAUSED
CINDY STRAUSS' BROKEN NECK?

16:12.623 --> 16:13.711
NO.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.975
WE SIMULATED EVERY TRAJECTORY

16:15.975 --> 16:18.064
THAT A BODY OF HER HEIGHT
AND WEIGHT MIGHT POSSIBLY TRAVEL

16:18.064 --> 16:19.804
WHEN FALLING DOWN THE STAIRS,
AND IN NO SCENARIO

16:19.804 --> 16:21.589
DOES SHE EVER
BREAK HER OWN NECK

16:21.589 --> 16:23.591
IN THE SPECIFIC MANNER
IN WHICH IT WAS BROKEN.

16:23.591 --> 16:24.592
WHICH WAS?

16:24.592 --> 16:26.289
THE VIOLENT PROTRUSION

16:26.289 --> 16:29.553
OF THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE COLUMN
INTO THE CRANIAL VAULT.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.557
SOMEONE HAD TO HAVE BROKEN
HER NECK.

16:36.865 --> 16:40.782
DOCTOR, COULD YOU TELL US
WHAT TIME HER DEATH OCCURRED?

16:40.782 --> 16:42.392
ASSESSING MANY FACTORS,

16:42.392 --> 16:45.656
ANALYZING THE PARTIALLY DIGESTED
FOOD IN HER STOMACH,

16:45.656 --> 16:49.182
COMPARING THE ROOM TEMPERATURE
WITH THE LIVIDITY OF THE CORPSE,

16:49.182 --> 16:50.922
AND THE FACT THAT THE VICTIM

16:50.922 --> 16:54.056
WASN'T IN FULL RIGOR MORTIS
WHEN THE BODY WAS FOUND,

16:54.056 --> 16:57.451
WE PUT THE TIME OF DEATH
BETWEEN 8:30 AND 9:00 p.m.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.061
THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE BODY WAS FOUND.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.456
THANK YOU, DR. BURNSIDE.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.937
MR. DANIELS.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.986
OKAY, THEN.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.380
IN YOUR TOXICOLOGY REPORT,

17:13.380 --> 17:16.339
YOU STATE THERE WAS
ALCOHOL, XANAX, AND MDMA

17:16.339 --> 17:17.906
IN CINDY STRAUSS' BODY.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.125
IS THAT CORRECT?

17:19.125 --> 17:20.387
YES.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.128
IN COMBINATION,

17:22.128 --> 17:24.826
WHAT WOULD BE THE LIKELY
SIDE EFFECTS OF THESE DRUGS?

17:24.826 --> 17:28.047
DIZZINESS, DISORIENTATION,
LOSS OF IMPULSE CONTROL,

17:28.047 --> 17:31.267
LACK OF MOTOR COORDINATION,
IMPAIRED REACTION TIME.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.182
SO, WOULD IT BE SAFE TO SAY,
DOCTOR,

17:33.182 --> 17:37.273
THAT, SIMPLY PUT,
CINDY STRAUSS WAS LOADED?

17:37.273 --> 17:38.753
SADLY, YES.

17:38.753 --> 17:42.322
IN OTHER WORDS,
AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN?

17:42.322 --> 17:43.410
OBJECTION.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.716
WITHDRAWN.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.850
Daniels:
MOVING ON, DOCTOR.

17:48.850 --> 17:53.202
YOU ESTIMATED THE TIME OF DEATH
BASED, IN PART,

17:53.202 --> 17:56.075
ON THE AMOUNT
OF PARTIALLY DIGESTED FOOD

17:56.075 --> 17:57.511
IN MISS STRAUSS' STOMACH.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.034
IS THAT RIGHT?
YES.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.210
CAN'T ONE WOMAN DIGEST

18:01.210 --> 18:02.777
AT A DIFFERENT RATE
THAN ANOTHER WOMAN?

18:02.777 --> 18:04.866
YES, OF COURSE,

18:04.866 --> 18:08.043
BASED ON AGE, SIZE,

18:08.043 --> 18:10.698
WEIGHT, LEVEL OF FITNESS,
GENERAL HEALTH.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.135
AND WOULD A WOMAN
SIMULTANEOUSLY

18:13.135 --> 18:17.444
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL,
XANAX, AND ECSTASY, SAY,

18:17.444 --> 18:19.098
DIGEST AT A DIFFERENT RATE

18:19.098 --> 18:21.839
THAN A WOMAN
NOT SIMILARLY MEDICATED?

18:21.839 --> 18:23.667
I TOOK ALL THOSE FACTORS
INTO ACCOUNT.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.017
REALLY?

18:26.017 --> 18:27.367
ISN'T THAT
JUST A FANCY WAY

18:27.367 --> 18:29.064
OF SAYING
YOU TOOK AN EDUCATED GUESS?

18:29.064 --> 18:32.546
WITH AN EMPHASIS
ON "EDUCATED."

18:32.546 --> 18:35.810
AH, AND WOULD
IT ALSO BE FAIR TO SAY

18:35.810 --> 18:37.594
THAT THE TIME OF DEATH
YOU PEGGED

18:37.594 --> 18:41.294
AT BETWEEN 8:30 AND 9:00 p.m.
IS ALSO AN EDUCATED GUESS?

18:41.294 --> 18:43.078
YES.

18:43.078 --> 18:46.516
WITH THE EMPHASIS
ON "GUESS."

18:46.516 --> 18:51.347
COULD THE TIME OF DEATH
HAVE BEEN, SAY...8:28?

18:51.347 --> 18:52.870
CERTAINLY.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.133
8:24?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.830
IT'S POSSIBLE.

18:55.830 --> 18:59.225
BECAUSE 8:30 ISN'T REALLY
AN EXACT NUMBER HERE,

18:59.225 --> 19:00.400
IS IT, DOCTOR?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.924
IT'S AN APPROXIMATION.
AH.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.360
SO, YOU'VE GIVEN US

19:04.360 --> 19:07.146
AN APPROXIMATE HALF-HOUR WINDOW
OF DEATH,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.365
BUT IT COULD BE
THAT SHE DIED

19:09.365 --> 19:12.934
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
8:18 AND 9:07, COULDN'T IT?

19:12.934 --> 19:15.066
YES, IT COULD.
SO, REALLY,

19:15.066 --> 19:16.633
YOUR HALF-HOUR WINDOW

19:16.633 --> 19:19.549
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE MUCH CLOSER
TO AN HOUR.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.551
NOW, LET'S GO BACK

19:21.551 --> 19:24.075
TO YOUR COMPUTER-GENERATED
SCENARIOS FOR A MINUTE.

19:24.075 --> 19:27.166
LET'S IMAGINE
THAT CINDY STRAUSS,

19:27.166 --> 19:31.213
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL,
XANAX, AND ECSTASY,

19:31.213 --> 19:35.261
HAS SEX WITH A MAN ON THE NIGHT
OF HER DEATH,

19:35.261 --> 19:37.959
AND IN THE AFTERMATH,
SHE REVEALS TO THIS MAN

19:37.959 --> 19:40.614
THAT SHE IS PREGNANT
WITH HIS CHILD.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.617
SHOCKED,
HE DEMANDS TO KNOW

19:43.617 --> 19:45.662
HOW SHE COULD PUT THE HEALTH
OF THE FETUS AT RISK

19:45.662 --> 19:47.795
BY DRINKING AND DOING DRUGS.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.972
THEY ARGUE OVER WHETHER
SHE SHOULD HAVE AN ABORTION.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.888
SHE REFUSES.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.804
FURIOUS, HE TURNS TO GO.

19:56.804 --> 20:01.548
NAKED, SHE FOLLOWS HIM OUT
INTO THE HALL, GRABBING AT HIM.

20:01.548 --> 20:04.681
HE PULLS AWAY FROM HER
AND STARTS DOWN THE STAIRS.

20:04.681 --> 20:07.162
SHE RUNS AFTER HIM,

20:07.162 --> 20:11.514
AND IN HER DRUG-
AND ALCOHOL-ADDLED CONDITION,

20:11.514 --> 20:15.779
SHE TRIPS AND TUMBLES
HEAD OVER HEELS DOWN THE STAIRS,

20:15.779 --> 20:18.869
LANDING ON HER HEAD
AND BREAKING HER NECK,

20:18.869 --> 20:20.828
WHEN HER
CERVICAL VERTEBRAE COLUMN

20:20.828 --> 20:24.310
VIOLENTLY PROTRUDES
INTO HER CRANIAL VAULT.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.357
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
THAT PARTICULAR

20:28.357 --> 20:30.577
COMPUTER-GENERATED SCENARIO
HANDY, WOULD YOU?

20:30.577 --> 20:33.057
IT'S OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE

20:33.057 --> 20:36.147
FOR US TO IMAGINE
EVERY CONCEIVABLE SCENARIO.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.498
AHA. AHA.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.977
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.718
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.948
Mike: HEY.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.210
HEY.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.343
WHAT'S UP?

20:57.343 --> 20:59.519
OH, NOTHING'S UP.

21:01.782 --> 21:04.175
WALK WITH ME
FOR A SECOND?
