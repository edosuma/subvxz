00:01.392 --> 00:03.307
<i>Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:03.351 --> 00:06.528
Thousands of years ago,
there was an evil imp
who created an AllStone

00:06.571 --> 00:09.052
to give him mastery
over everything.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.619
The other imps found out
about it

00:10.662 --> 00:12.186
<i>and they blew up
the AllStone,</i>

00:12.229 --> 00:14.927
scattering the pieces
throughout the known universes

00:14.971 --> 00:16.451
where they became Totems.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.888
<i>Nyxly needs the Totems
to make a new AllStone.</i>

00:18.931 --> 00:21.108
<i>My only desire is to rule
by your side</i>

00:21.151 --> 00:23.110
while destroying everyone
who gets in our way.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.460
And after
we've rebuilt the AllStone,
you're going to betray me.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.331
Betraying you
is inconceivable.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.246
<i>The Love Totem disappeared.</i>

00:29.290 --> 00:32.423
The Totems' powers
are so elemental in nature,
they can't be destroyed.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.643
<i>They only reconstitute
in a new form.</i>

00:34.686 --> 00:38.038
I'm an ex-con.
I don't really have a place to
live and I take care of Joey.

00:38.081 --> 00:41.476
That's exactly why the Heights
is gonna need a new
council member.

00:41.519 --> 00:45.132
<i>CatCo reporter William Dey
has leaked Lex's
private journal.</i>

00:45.175 --> 00:46.481
This is my reputation.

00:46.524 --> 00:49.832
You used my name
to validate an unethical story.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.964
<i>I had
to prevent your friends
from understanding</i>

00:52.008 --> 00:54.576
<i>how important
the little girl was
until I got what I wanted.</i>

00:54.619 --> 00:57.405
<i>-To Andrea Rojas.
Here's your real story.</i>

00:57.448 --> 00:59.015
- Esme is gone.
- Oh, my God!

01:08.155 --> 01:09.199
<i>Well, this is awkward.</i>

01:09.634 --> 01:11.680
Lex.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.551
<i>I can only imagine
emotions must be running high
right now.</i>

01:13.595 --> 01:15.684
If you hurt my daughter,
I will kill you.

01:15.727 --> 01:16.902
- Do you hear me?
- Alex.

01:16.946 --> 01:18.600
No, it's just a recording.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.384
He's too much of a coward
to face us in person.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.473
<i>Now, there's no need to worry
about the little alien.</i>

01:22.517 --> 01:24.562
<i>She's safe
and won't be harmed.</i>

01:25.650 --> 01:26.912
<i>Baby Truth Seeker.</i>

01:26.956 --> 01:28.131
<i>I cannot tell a lie.</i>

01:30.090 --> 01:31.787
<i>Seven Totems.</i>

01:31.830 --> 01:38.010
<i>Courage, Hope, Humanity,
Dream, Truth, Destiny and Love.</i>

01:38.054 --> 01:40.622
<i>You are in possession
of five of them,</i>

01:40.665 --> 01:44.626
<i>while Nyxly and I
are in possession
of just one.</i>

01:44.669 --> 01:47.542
<i>The Love Totem
has merged with the girl.</i>

01:47.585 --> 01:50.197
<i>You bring me your five,
plus the Totem
still to be found,</i>

01:50.240 --> 01:53.504
<i>the Destiny Totem,
and I will trade you Esme.</i>

01:54.244 --> 01:55.593
<i>Easy-peasy.</i>

01:55.637 --> 01:57.247
<i>Now, before you go
screaming "trap,"</i>

01:57.291 --> 01:59.641
<i>let me assuage your fears.</i>

01:59.684 --> 02:03.079
<i>There is one place
on this planet where
we can't harm one another.</i>

02:03.123 --> 02:06.038
<i>A lovely bridge
near the Fort Rozz
crash site.</i>

02:06.082 --> 02:09.694
<i>The Omegahedron explosion
from, what? Six years ago?</i>

02:09.738 --> 02:14.482
<i>Well, that explosion rendered
all tech and super powers
in that area inert.</i>

02:14.525 --> 02:16.745
It is indeed a dead zone.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.964
<i>I will bring the girl there
noon tomorrow.</i>

02:19.008 --> 02:21.402
<i>Enough time for Nyxly and I
to have safely retrieved
the Love Totem</i>

02:21.445 --> 02:23.578
<i>and for you
to have done the same</i>

02:23.621 --> 02:25.971
<i>with the Destiny Totem.</i>

02:26.015 --> 02:31.542
<i>You fail to show up
or you turn this exchange
into something unpleasant,</i>

02:31.586 --> 02:33.501
<i>the girl will end up
like your friend...</i>

02:34.154 --> 02:35.416
<i>William Dey.</i>

02:36.678 --> 02:37.940
<i>Be safe out there.</i>

02:37.983 --> 02:39.420
Would be a shame
if something happened to you

02:39.463 --> 02:40.725
before we get to see
each other again.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.785
Okay, we are going to find them
and we are going
to get Esme back.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.090
I will fix this.

02:59.309 --> 03:00.919
Brainy, start scanning
every inch of this globe

03:00.963 --> 03:02.747
for Lex, Nyxly,
Mitch and Esme.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.096
We need to find them.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.533
I'll search every place
that Lex has access to

03:05.576 --> 03:06.577
and try to track him down

03:06.621 --> 03:07.622
with one of
my mother's spells.

03:07.665 --> 03:08.797
I always knew
Lex was dangerous,

03:08.840 --> 03:10.190
but this is going too far.

03:10.233 --> 03:11.887
We need to find
that Destiny Totem.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.454
Nia, can you dream
their location?

03:13.497 --> 03:14.716
I can try.

03:14.759 --> 03:15.891
But it didn't work last time,

03:15.934 --> 03:17.414
even with Lena's magic.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.764
Now we have
the Dream Totem.

03:19.808 --> 03:22.245
I can build you
an arm shield like I did
for J'onn and Supergirl

03:22.289 --> 03:24.682
and you could wield
the Totem's power to find it.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.206
We don't need it.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.250
Because Lena
can conjure up

03:27.294 --> 03:28.295
a decoy Destiny Totem

03:28.338 --> 03:29.426
and I will take it

03:29.470 --> 03:31.559
and rest of the Totems
to the bridge,

03:31.602 --> 03:33.213
and I will get Esme to safety.

03:33.256 --> 03:36.694
And then I will kill Lex
with my bare hands.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.218
Nothing will work
on the bridge, Alex.

03:38.261 --> 03:42.265
And even if it did,
Lex will figure out it's fake.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.658
Then we give him
what he wants.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.443
No, Alex, we can't give
Lex and Nyxly a Totem.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.793
We can't give them
more power.

03:48.837 --> 03:49.925
They'll use it against us.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.013
They'll destroy this world.

03:51.056 --> 03:53.145
I don't care about anything

03:53.189 --> 03:54.930
other than getting
our daughter back.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.106
And we will get her back.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.673
By finding
the Destiny Totem

03:58.716 --> 04:00.631
and using it
and the rest of the Totems

04:00.675 --> 04:02.198
to power me up.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.678
And then I will find them,

04:03.721 --> 04:05.288
I will get Esme back,

04:05.332 --> 04:08.160
and I will stop Lex and Nyxly
once and for all.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.424
- Kara--
- No, I know you're panicking.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.905
We are all devastated
right now.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.605
But I am trying to keep
a clear head

04:17.648 --> 04:19.824
so that no one else
gets hurt by them.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.698
You just need
to trust me, okay?

04:23.741 --> 04:26.744
Just trust me.
I will get your daughter back.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.146
I put out snacks
for the little one.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.280
I do hope she likes canapes.

04:43.587 --> 04:44.545
They're delicious.

04:44.588 --> 04:45.763
She's already quite spooked

04:45.807 --> 04:47.591
without having to look
at you two ghouls.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.898
Please leave.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.726
I'll try not to be offended
by that remark.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.076
You see, Esme?

04:54.119 --> 04:57.340
I told you
there'd be a tea party
waiting for us.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.212
I'm never going to see
my moms again, am I?

05:00.996 --> 05:02.519
Of course you are.

05:02.563 --> 05:05.087
This beautiful,
kind woman will make sure
that you do.

05:05.130 --> 05:08.264
Nothing good has
ever lasted long for me.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.702
Maybe we should
get on with this.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.928
Do you want to try
and say a funny word
to cheer yourself up?

05:19.971 --> 05:22.757
Sometimes when you say
a funny word, it can put
a smile on your face.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.716
No? All right.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.764
Maybe I'll just
try it for you.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.158
<i>Cgyrzyx.</i>

05:56.138 --> 05:59.097
The tattoo
is losing its petals.

05:59.141 --> 06:00.969
And you don't have
to have seen <i>
Beauty and the Beast</i>

06:01.012 --> 06:02.710
to know that
when it loses them all,

06:02.753 --> 06:06.017
the Totem will find
a new host and be lost to us.

06:06.844 --> 06:07.932
We need to get it out now.

06:07.976 --> 06:09.325
What is taking so long?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.718
I don't know.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.415
It won't show me
the gauntlet.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.983
I can't get the Totem
out of her
until it's revealed to me.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.637
Maybe we should just cut it
out of her while we--

06:16.680 --> 06:19.117
I will not let you hurt
that little girl.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.077
If you know me as well
as you claim,

06:22.120 --> 06:23.818
you would know
hurting an innocent child

06:23.861 --> 06:27.038
is something I would never,
ever agree to.

06:33.958 --> 06:34.872
In the future,

06:35.569 --> 06:37.440
our demise hinges

06:37.484 --> 06:41.357
on how you
come into possession
of the Love Totem in this time.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.359
You used magic to end-run
the gauntlet

06:43.403 --> 06:45.013
and as a result,
you perished.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.450
And I will not
let that happen again, ever.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.106
Maybe I need to
get it out this time.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.108
I can try to access
the gauntlet.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.284
You get it?

06:55.327 --> 06:56.720
Is this some sort of setup?

06:56.764 --> 06:58.853
You want the Totem
for yourself?

06:58.896 --> 07:01.377
No. I just want what's best
for you so that we can have
the future we deserve.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.074
What's best for me
is no man doing something

07:03.118 --> 07:04.815
I'm quite capable
of doing myself.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.601
The girl is scared.

07:08.558 --> 07:09.907
Once I gain her trust,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.128
the gauntlet
will be revealed to me.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.913
And then I will get
the Love Totem.

07:17.828 --> 07:21.658
I just need your word
that you will not hurt her.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.399
I would never betray
the woman I love.

07:54.604 --> 07:55.518
Don't move.

08:00.305 --> 08:01.263
Lena.

08:03.918 --> 08:04.962
What are you doing here?

08:06.137 --> 08:07.661
How did you find us?

08:07.704 --> 08:10.490
William sent me a video
of him and Lex.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.579
I followed William's trail.

08:12.622 --> 08:13.884
I should have known
I'd be too late.

08:16.757 --> 08:18.846
William was already gone
when Supergirl got here.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.370
Instead of hedging,

08:21.413 --> 08:23.415
you should've just told me
the truth when I asked you.

08:25.461 --> 08:26.854
I am a monster.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.771
William said I stood
for nothing, and he was right.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.337
No, you're not
a monster, Andrea.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.122
Lex is.
He did this, not you.

08:34.165 --> 08:36.516
Whenever my back
is to the wall,

08:36.559 --> 08:39.214
I do whatever I have to do
to get out from under,

08:40.171 --> 08:41.521
no matter who I hurt.

08:44.654 --> 08:45.786
Fine.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.397
You're right.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.400
So what are you going
to do about it?

08:51.443 --> 08:52.357
It's too late.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.796
I can't fix this.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.537
I can't bring
William back. I...

08:58.842 --> 09:00.496
I can't fix anything
I've done.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.586
No, there's still time
for you to be
a better person, Andrea.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.675
I have stood where you are.

09:05.719 --> 09:10.637
I have made worse mistakes.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.812
Rationalized more.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.858
You can still make amends...

09:14.902 --> 09:17.208
to yourself and the people
that you've wronged,

09:17.252 --> 09:18.775
and live a meaningful life.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.171
How?

09:23.214 --> 09:25.695
Got to embrace the person
you want to be and the choices
you want to make.

09:28.393 --> 09:29.699
And still stay mindful

09:31.048 --> 09:33.050
when that darkness
wants to take over.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.097
So you can move forward,

09:37.228 --> 09:38.099
never back.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.456
This is my worst nightmare.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.546
Someone I love,
dying on my watch.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.549
It never gets any easier.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.942
But we have to stay focused.

09:56.857 --> 10:00.208
I must have circled the globe
a dozen times just listening,
scanning.

10:00.251 --> 10:03.777
There's no sign of Lex
at any of his hideouts.

10:03.820 --> 10:07.476
I knew. I knew I shouldn't
have taken my eye off the ball,
even for a second.

10:09.130 --> 10:12.699
J'onn, it's my job to keep
my family safe.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.398
He died protecting Esme.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.141
Yeah, I let
my guard down too.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.882
You know, I'm done.
I'm done.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.449
I am so tired of this fight.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.669
Whatever I need to do,

10:26.713 --> 10:28.540
whatever power
I need to claim

10:28.584 --> 10:31.326
to rescue Esme
and stop Lex and Nyxly,

10:31.369 --> 10:33.328
even if it means using
the AllStone myself,

10:34.285 --> 10:35.678
I will take it.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.115
And I'll be right
by your side.

10:42.990 --> 10:46.689
You agreed to let Nyxly
try to get the Love Totem
out of Esme her way.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.692
If she can gain
the child's trust and access
the gauntlet, great.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.696
If not,
she'll have to agree

10:53.740 --> 10:58.222
that the only way
to get the Totem
is to kill the little brat.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.008
I see you've forgotten
the most basic rule of chess.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.749
If you touch a piece--

11:02.792 --> 11:05.055
You must make a move
or capture that piece,
if legal to do so.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.143
Hello, Mother.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.884
This is a surprise.

11:08.842 --> 11:09.973
Oh.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.802
Bobby Fischer made that
exact mistake.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.326
- Buenos Aires, 1960.
- 1960, yes.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.893
Cost him the match
with Unzicker.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.942
Speaking of terrible moves,

11:22.594 --> 11:24.335
there are reports

11:24.379 --> 11:27.208
that you murdered
a CatCo journalist
and kidnapped a little girl.

11:28.992 --> 11:29.993
What's the play this time?

11:30.733 --> 11:32.169
There's no play.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.301
I'm in love, Mother.

11:37.305 --> 11:40.177
So that leaked journal

11:40.221 --> 11:43.528
with those treacly love poems,
it's actually yours?

11:43.572 --> 11:45.095
And this Nyxly, she's--

11:45.139 --> 11:47.010
Like no woman
I've ever met.

11:47.054 --> 11:50.187
We're halves of the same whole.
Yin and yang, alpha and omega.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.754
She's fierce, brilliant--

11:51.798 --> 11:53.016
And an alien.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.888
You don't understand.

11:54.931 --> 11:59.588
With Nyxly,
I finally feel like I am
the man I'm meant to be.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.242
No one has ever
had my back like her.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.983
Certainly not you
or my dear sister.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.854
Time after time,

12:04.898 --> 12:07.901
you and Lena have stabbed me
in the back when I needed you
the most.

12:07.944 --> 12:10.730
I know
it was a different Earth,
but you did try to poison me.

12:10.773 --> 12:14.385
What you should be
concerned with
is the present,

12:14.429 --> 12:17.040
and the murder
and kidnapping charges
you'll be facing.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.912
If I'm caught,
which I won't.

12:18.955 --> 12:21.523
Our lawyers say
you can plead insanity.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.046
And I agree.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.744
My love for Nyxly is real.

12:24.787 --> 12:25.614
Drop her.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.181
Now.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.705
I'm not
taking orders from you.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.403
Besides, I have been
to the future where Nyxly
and I rule together

12:32.447 --> 12:34.884
as the most powerful couple
in the universe.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.059
It's destiny.

12:36.103 --> 12:39.367
Your true destiny
is with your family.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.412
You, me, your sister.

12:41.456 --> 12:45.939
We are powerful
and can accomplish
great things together.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.377
The choice is easy.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.074
Your family

12:51.640 --> 12:52.510
or the imp.

12:54.817 --> 12:55.818
You're absolutely right.

12:56.863 --> 12:57.689
The choice is easy.

12:59.648 --> 13:00.475
I choose Nyxly.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.013
What's that you're drawing?

13:17.753 --> 13:18.841
My moms.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.930
I want to remember them.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.715
Well, you will be
with them again.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.152
I will make sure of it.

13:29.765 --> 13:30.679
You know,

13:31.549 --> 13:33.856
when I was your age,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.163
I loved nothing more
than drawing.

13:36.206 --> 13:40.645
I would sit by the lake
for hours and hours
and I would just draw.

13:42.299 --> 13:46.086
I had pencils in every color
you could possibly imagine...

13:46.129 --> 13:48.262
until one day
they were gone.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.133
What happened to them?

13:51.526 --> 13:53.093
My father had them destroyed.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.531
He thought art was useless.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.054
And that as a princess,

13:58.098 --> 14:00.143
I shouldn't
be wasting my time
with such nonsense.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.930
And then he tried
to slit my throat.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.935
I don't like that story.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.588
I don't blame you,
little one.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.853
My point is,

14:13.896 --> 14:17.334
just because scary things
happen to us sometimes,

14:17.378 --> 14:21.121
it doesn't mean
that we're always destined
for only bad things.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.342
You can be reunited
with your family

14:25.995 --> 14:26.866
if you believe it.

14:29.259 --> 14:32.741
So, why don't we smile

14:32.784 --> 14:34.830
and try and say
that funny word again?

14:37.789 --> 14:38.747
<i>Cgyrzyx.</i>

15:10.779 --> 15:11.693
Alex?

15:19.396 --> 15:20.920
I came in here, um...

15:24.271 --> 15:26.055
...looking for weapons.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.666
You know, just anything
that I could take
on that bridge.

15:30.451 --> 15:33.454
I keep thinking
how scared she must be.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.762
You know, we promised her
that she would never
leave us.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.287
What she must be thinking...

15:42.463 --> 15:43.638
Powerless.

15:44.552 --> 15:45.945
Kelly, powerless.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.076
There is my Kryptonite.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.340
I know.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.255
I just, I have to believe
that things are going
to work out.

15:54.388 --> 15:55.998
Because if I believe
anything else...

15:56.042 --> 15:59.436
I know. I'm going through
all of the what ifs.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.482
I mean,
if I had listened to Kara,

16:01.525 --> 16:03.745
if I had put on
the power dampeners,

16:03.788 --> 16:05.703
if I had kept her safer,

16:05.747 --> 16:07.705
then maybe she wouldn't have
turned into the Love Totem.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.272
There are so many ifs.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.796
Okay,
we can't play this game.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.234
Don't doubt
what you did for her.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.063
How much we love her.

16:18.368 --> 16:19.979
It's because of that love.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.156
That Totem seeks out love.

16:23.199 --> 16:26.376
It's because
of how much we love her.

16:29.684 --> 16:30.554
Whatever it takes,

16:32.469 --> 16:33.340
we're going to do it.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.169
Whatever it takes.

16:41.565 --> 16:44.264
See, it fits perfectly.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.483
Like <i>Cinderella...</i>

16:46.527 --> 16:49.051
without the gender inequality
through patriarchy

16:49.095 --> 16:51.010
- and sexual objectification.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.847
Brainy, what if I dream
something terrible?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.852
About Esme.
What if I dream that we never
get her back or that Lex...

17:11.291 --> 17:14.381
Ever since I saw
William lying there...
What if I see...

17:14.424 --> 17:15.251
Then you'll see it.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.863
Good or bad,

17:18.907 --> 17:20.561
knowing the truth
allows you to deal with it.

17:21.910 --> 17:22.780
Like with us.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.914
I would have been called
to the future regardless,

17:25.957 --> 17:27.698
but knowing allows us
to deal with things.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.094
In our case,

17:32.138 --> 17:33.835
treasuring the time
we have left together.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.318
Whatever you do see
in your dream,

17:39.449 --> 17:41.060
I will be by your side.

17:44.846 --> 17:47.240
Then come with me.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.546
I can bring you
into the Dream Realm
just like I brought Maeve.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.767
And we'll face it together.

17:53.942 --> 17:54.769
Together.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.090
- Hey.
- So, did the tech work?

18:11.133 --> 18:12.830
Did you find
the Destiny Totem?

18:12.874 --> 18:14.136
Not only that, but...

18:14.180 --> 18:15.703
I was able
to sense Esme too.

18:15.746 --> 18:16.660
She's safe.

18:16.704 --> 18:17.618
Thank God.

18:17.661 --> 18:18.575
So where is she?

18:18.619 --> 18:19.446
I don't know.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.103
But we discovered
the Destiny Totem

18:24.146 --> 18:26.931
is at the ruins of
St. Vassily's Cathedral
in Prague.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.716
Home of the Statue
of the Three Fates.

18:28.759 --> 18:32.981
Those three fates
are Clotho, Lachesis
and Atropos.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.505
Clotho was a spinner.
She spun the thread of life.

18:35.549 --> 18:36.985
Thread of Destiny.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.248
I'll go get the Totem
and then we'll get Esme back.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.140
<i>Cgyrzyx.</i>

19:02.576 --> 19:04.578
<i>In order
to take the Totem,</i>

19:04.621 --> 19:07.015
<i>you must face your destiny
without it.</i>

19:21.682 --> 19:22.683
Alex?

19:23.553 --> 19:24.685
What are you doing?

19:24.728 --> 19:26.208
Whatever it takes
to get my daughter back.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.388
Alex.

19:32.432 --> 19:33.868
Alex, give me the Totem.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.218
I can save Esme.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.828
Esme is gone.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.308
And the only way
to keep her safe

19:39.352 --> 19:41.571
is by giving Lex what he wants,
which is the Totems.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.051
And then I'm gonna bring
my daughter home.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.227
Listen. Please, wait.

19:45.271 --> 19:48.143
When I activated
the Destiny Totem,
it showed me my destiny.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.711
It's...

19:51.668 --> 19:54.628
Lex and Nyxly
are all-powerful.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.891
Governments waging war
against them.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.545
The world is in shambles.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.155
And the only way
to prevent that

20:00.199 --> 20:02.157
is by using the combined power
of the Totems against them.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.247
She's my daughter, Kara,
my daughter.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.075
I would risk the world

20:07.118 --> 20:08.642
rather than losing her

20:08.685 --> 20:10.644
by paying his ransom.

20:10.687 --> 20:13.516
If doing that
puts my little girl
back in my arms again,

20:13.560 --> 20:15.649
then that is exactly
what I'm going to do.

20:15.692 --> 20:16.954
Alex...

20:18.869 --> 20:20.219
I won't be able
to stop them.

20:21.176 --> 20:22.569
Not once
they're all-powerful.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.529
Okay, so what if
your plan fails

20:27.443 --> 20:29.663
and something happens
to Esme?

20:31.099 --> 20:33.319
I would never forgive myself.

20:35.103 --> 20:38.149
And I could never forgive you.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.287
Are you 100% certain

20:45.331 --> 20:47.202
that Lex will hold up
his end of the bargain?

20:49.160 --> 20:53.034
Are you 100% certain
that you could save Esme?

20:59.301 --> 21:00.302
I didn't think so.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.566
I'm sorry, Kara.

21:18.712 --> 21:19.626
Lillian.

21:21.497 --> 21:23.325
Huh.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.284
Lex didn't tell me
you were going to drop in.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.155
I came to see you.

21:32.029 --> 21:36.338
So, you're Nyxly.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.035
Mmm-hmm.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.516
I can see why
you caught his eye.
You're quite beautiful.

21:42.301 --> 21:46.827
But you're an alien,
and my son loathes aliens.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.699
I'm a princess.
And your son loves me.

21:49.743 --> 21:54.225
Lex is incapable
of loving anyone but himself.

21:54.269 --> 21:58.795
Well, he can be charming,
but he's a sociopath.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.362
And they're very good liars.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.106
I see what
you're trying to do.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.500
You know, if you're
so compelled to meddle

22:07.543 --> 22:10.459
in your son's life and love,
you should just go talk to him.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.637
He's using you.

22:14.681 --> 22:20.426
I'm a 5th Dimensional imp
with powers you can't possibly
even begin to fathom.

22:21.688 --> 22:22.558
I'm nobody's fool.

22:25.518 --> 22:30.784
But you don't have any powers
at the moment, do you, dear?

22:30.827 --> 22:36.355
I've read
all about your daddy issues
and thirst for revenge.

22:36.398 --> 22:41.055
Let me guess, Lex promised
to help you in exchange for...

22:45.015 --> 22:46.669
- Nothing.
- Mmm.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.368
Are you sure about that?

22:50.020 --> 22:51.065
Mmm-hmm.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.027
Don't say
you weren't warned.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.861
Did you get
the Destiny Totem?

23:04.905 --> 23:07.386
Yes, I did.

23:07.429 --> 23:10.693
But then Alex took it,
along with the rest
of the Totems.

23:10.737 --> 23:13.348
- What?
- Alex and Kelly
are gonna pay the ransom.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.220
Give the Totems to Lex
in return for Esme.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.222
We have to go after them,
stop them.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.181
I know we should, but...

23:22.749 --> 23:25.229
I had to let her go.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.842
And once Lex gets the Totems

23:28.885 --> 23:33.890
and he and Nyxly
create the AllStone, I won't
have the power to stop them.

23:33.934 --> 23:37.546
There has to be some way,
with science or magic,

23:37.590 --> 23:39.026
to stop the power
of the AllStone.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.071
There might be a way.

23:43.378 --> 23:45.902
The US government has
an experimental solar satellite

23:45.946 --> 23:48.078
they use for enhancing
crop growth.

23:48.122 --> 23:51.517
If we could adjust its orbit
and repurpose its output,

23:51.560 --> 23:55.042
the satellite could filter
a portion of the sun's energy
directly into Supergirl.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.087
Supercharging you.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.915
And what would that do?

23:58.959 --> 24:01.831
Your brain would process
information quicker.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.703
Your super hearing
would increase fifty-fold.

24:03.746 --> 24:07.489
More importantly,
5th Dimensional magic
will have no effect on you.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.926
You'd be invincible.

24:09.970 --> 24:12.799
It'll take four minutes
for the satellite
to fully charge you.

24:12.842 --> 24:15.932
Then you'll be able
to find Esme, neutralize
the threat of the AllStone,

24:15.976 --> 24:17.630
and defeat Lex and Nyxly.

24:17.673 --> 24:20.154
Brainy, that's great.
Why didn't you think
of this before?

24:21.242 --> 24:22.896
There is one tiny drawback.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.291
It'll take the sun six months
to regenerate.

24:27.335 --> 24:31.295
The sun is responsible
for ocean currents,
for climate, for plant life.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.036
Any disruption
would be devastating.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.517
Not to mention
that the sun's orbit
could be altered.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.128
So I'll put it back.
I'll fix it.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.522
Because if we don't act
before that ransom exchange,

24:40.566 --> 24:42.437
we'll have no hope
of stopping them.

24:42.481 --> 24:48.487
Kara... Kara, listen to me.
You can't do this.
You'll be playing God.

24:48.530 --> 24:51.228
I went down that path
with Non Nocere,
and you saw what happened.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.404
And I saw what will happen
if they get the AllStone.

24:55.276 --> 24:58.279
It's global destruction, Lena.

24:58.322 --> 25:02.979
I hear what you're saying.
I do, but I have
to do something.

25:05.112 --> 25:08.289
I'm gonna go
to the bridge to help Alex
and Kelly get Esme back.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.900
I'll go with you.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.599
The satellite
will be over National City
in ten minutes.

25:13.642 --> 25:16.166
J'onn will move
the satellite into position,

25:16.210 --> 25:19.648
and from the ground
I'll calibrate the signal
with a remote.

25:19.692 --> 25:23.347
But this satellite
is a joint project between
the US government

25:23.391 --> 25:24.871
and South America,
which means it falls

25:24.914 --> 25:27.526
under the jurisdiction
of the Department of State.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.528
The moment we take control
of that satellite...

25:29.571 --> 25:31.181
Secretary Brown
will be all over us.

25:31.225 --> 25:33.227
And with her,
the entire US Army.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.359
Let's go catch a satellite.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.424
I know
what I need to do, but...

25:56.467 --> 25:57.860
Can I get you anything, sir?

25:57.904 --> 25:59.296
If I do it,
she won't like it.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.081
I said I wouldn't.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.692
Gave her my word.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.912
She'll have to understand
our future depends on it.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.701
Philippe,
I need you to keep Nyxly
out of Esme's room

26:12.745 --> 26:14.747
while I access the gauntlet
for the Love Totem.

26:15.399 --> 26:16.357
Very well, sir.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.604
It's showtime.

26:58.225 --> 26:59.095
No!

27:03.709 --> 27:05.014
Lex, what have you done?

27:05.058 --> 27:07.495
I know I promised,
but I knew that Mxy's essence,

27:07.538 --> 27:11.325
a burst of 5th Dimensional
energy would grant access
to the Love Totem's gauntlet.

27:11.368 --> 27:14.328
I wanted to save you
from yourself and what you
did to get it in the future.

27:14.371 --> 27:15.764
By sneaking behind my back?

27:17.723 --> 27:20.073
You don't care
about me at all.

27:20.116 --> 27:21.640
You just want the Totems
for yourself.

27:22.466 --> 27:23.642
Huh.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.121
Your mother was right.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.907
My mother?
Whatever she told you,
don't believe it.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.865
That woman would rather
see me dead than happy.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.737
You're scaring Esme.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.304
I get that you
don't want to hurt the kid,
but we are out of time.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.742
No. No!

27:41.529 --> 27:43.139
I won't let you
harm this child.

27:47.666 --> 27:52.148
<i>Fill your heart
with love. Only then will love
be given to you.</i>

27:59.765 --> 28:01.288
The Love Totem.

28:01.331 --> 28:04.726
See, I was right to break
the crystal ball.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.033
I got you the Totem,
and it's perfect timing.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.687
We have got to get
to the bridge.

28:08.730 --> 28:11.211
I told you there is no "we."

28:11.864 --> 28:12.821
No more.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.823
Come on, Esme. Esme?

28:14.867 --> 28:16.346
Let's get you back
to your family.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.870
All right? Come on.

28:20.176 --> 28:23.136
The plan worked!

28:23.179 --> 28:28.010
That proves
I didn't betray you.
I couldn't. You...

28:28.054 --> 28:29.664
You have to believe that!

28:31.361 --> 28:34.713
From the moment I met you,
I knew you shouldn't
be trusted.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.627
You're nothing
but a foul little man

28:36.671 --> 28:40.675
who lies and cheats
and plays mind games
to get what he wants.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.200
You're just like my father.

28:44.244 --> 28:48.509
I could say I hate you,
but the truth is I pity you.

28:49.336 --> 28:50.467
No one will ever love you.

28:52.078 --> 28:52.992
Goodbye, Lex.

29:06.309 --> 29:09.138
Hello, Lex.

29:09.182 --> 29:12.446
I heard from Philippe
that the imp broke up with you.

29:12.489 --> 29:15.492
- Have you come
to say I told you so?
- Of course.

29:15.536 --> 29:19.670
And to say you're lucky
I'm your mother,
because I forgive you.

29:21.411 --> 29:24.240
I was sure you'd be busy
packing an arsenal
to kill her.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.895
Timing is everything, Mother.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.291
Do you like
watching fireworks?

29:45.044 --> 29:47.002
We're not crazy
for doing this, right?

29:47.046 --> 29:48.830
We're getting
our daughter back.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.701
Anyone care
for some backup?

29:52.094 --> 29:53.922
Is, uh, Kara...

29:53.966 --> 29:56.055
She's preparing to fight Lex
in her own way.

29:57.839 --> 30:02.278
No matter whose plan works,
we are going home
with Esme tonight.

30:03.366 --> 30:04.280
They're here.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.112
They came!

30:16.162 --> 30:17.598
Satellite is in position.

30:17.641 --> 30:18.904
I'm turning it on now.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.183
Supergirl, the clock
to four minutes has begun.

30:41.361 --> 30:43.972
Bring the Totems
to the center of the bridge

30:44.016 --> 30:45.147
and I'll let Esme
come to you.

30:45.800 --> 30:46.714
Where's Lex?

30:47.715 --> 30:48.672
I'm done with him.

30:50.109 --> 30:50.979
Are you ready?

30:51.545 --> 30:52.415
Yep.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.168
Give me the Totems.

31:06.212 --> 31:07.953
Give us our daughter first.

31:07.996 --> 31:10.042
No, we do it
at the same time.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.136
All right, little lamb.

31:18.050 --> 31:19.790
Off you go.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.575
Come here, sweetie.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.142
Come here.

31:51.953 --> 31:52.867
The AllStone.

31:54.564 --> 31:55.783
The bad man is here.

31:55.826 --> 31:56.740
It's a trap!

32:12.408 --> 32:14.845
<i>Your brain would process
information quicker.</i>

32:14.889 --> 32:16.804
<i>Your super hearing
would increase fifty-fold.</i>

32:16.847 --> 32:18.240
What's up there?
It's her!

32:27.336 --> 32:30.949
Supergirl, two minutes
and 41 seconds
until the solar flare blast.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.211
Why is she doing this?

32:41.568 --> 32:42.786
Madam Secretary.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.875
I don't know
what you people are planning,

32:44.919 --> 32:47.313
but can't you see
you're hurting the people
you're trying to help?

32:47.356 --> 32:50.142
If we don't do this,
Lex Luthor will do
much worse.

32:50.185 --> 32:51.491
That's not
a good enough answer.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.276
Drop the remote.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.886
I am not going
to tell you again.

32:57.192 --> 32:58.802
I'm sorry, Madam Secretary.

33:00.413 --> 33:01.327
We can't.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.377
<i>What's happening down there?</i>

33:08.421 --> 33:09.422
Nothing I can't handle.

33:12.381 --> 33:13.295
One minute.

33:15.384 --> 33:18.344
Mr. President,
we need to call in
an air strike on Supergirl.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.217
I thought Supergirl
was our friend.

33:22.261 --> 33:24.915
Supergirl, please stop.

33:28.571 --> 33:29.746
Thirty seconds.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.536
<i>Supergirl, please stop.</i>

33:43.717 --> 33:46.676
J'onn, you can release
the solar flare blast
in six seconds.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.417
<i>Just give me the go-ahead.</i>

33:48.461 --> 33:51.333
Five, four...

33:51.377 --> 33:52.595
Brainy, J'onn...

33:53.553 --> 33:55.076
This isn't right,
shut it down.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.557
You said this is
the best way.

33:57.600 --> 34:01.169
No, seizing power
is what our enemies do.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.954
We're defined by our choices,
and this is the wrong one.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.391
Turn it off.

34:35.769 --> 34:39.425
I'm sorry. We were wrong.

34:42.471 --> 34:43.646
What do we do now?

34:45.300 --> 34:46.823
We help Alex get Esme back.

35:13.502 --> 35:14.634
That was for Esme.

35:29.301 --> 35:30.258
Guardian!

36:09.210 --> 36:10.559
Ah.

36:10.603 --> 36:11.734
The Brat of Brawn.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.302
I was wondering
when you'd show.

36:16.565 --> 36:18.915
Leave my family alone!

36:19.525 --> 36:20.482
Esme, no!

36:43.070 --> 36:45.072
I deserve the AllStone.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.944
I waited an eternity
in the Phantom Zone for it.

36:48.902 --> 36:50.469
Give me your piece.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.994
Or I will destroy everything
and everyone you ever loved.

36:54.037 --> 36:58.868
Since you think I am incapable
of loving anything or anyone,

36:58.912 --> 37:00.740
I guess
that doesn't apply to me.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.101
Lena, can you help?

37:33.207 --> 37:34.252
Lex!

37:40.475 --> 37:41.433
Mother!

37:49.963 --> 37:51.312
That's what happens

37:51.356 --> 37:53.445
when you let your mommy
do your fighting for you.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.223
Lillian is stable,
but it's not looking good.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.138
Lena's trying to find a spell
that could maybe save her.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.966
What's happening here?

38:37.010 --> 38:39.012
Lex and Nyxly have taken
their fight public,

38:39.055 --> 38:41.449
and are using portals to parry
and then retreat.

38:41.493 --> 38:43.538
Makes it nearly impossible
to get a lock
on their positions

38:43.582 --> 38:45.105
so we can launch
a counteroffensive.

38:45.148 --> 38:46.628
What's happening to them?

38:46.672 --> 38:48.935
Whatever it is,
I think it has something
to do with this.

38:51.851 --> 38:54.332
The more Lex and Nyxly use
their pieces of the AllStone,

38:54.375 --> 38:57.639
the more they'll drain
the world of the very elements
the Totems represent.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.903
Soon those things
will be lost forever.

39:00.947 --> 39:03.863
You're talking
truth and love...

39:03.906 --> 39:05.560
Hope.

39:05.604 --> 39:09.042
They're empowering themselves
by disempowering everyone else.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.961
We're looking
at the worldwide loss
of the very things

39:15.004 --> 39:18.268
that make humans human
in the next 72 hours.

39:18.312 --> 39:20.488
Okay, so what if
Nyxly goes back

39:20.532 --> 39:22.838
to the 5th Dimension,
would that at least spare ours?

39:22.882 --> 39:24.492
They each only have
a third of the AllStone,

39:24.536 --> 39:26.015
which gives them power,

39:26.059 --> 39:28.844
but not enough to tear open
a new dimensional doorway.

39:28.888 --> 39:32.021
Neither can win
if the other fights on.

39:32.065 --> 39:34.720
Which means
they're going to need your
piece of the AllStone, too.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.247
You could fight them with it.

39:40.290 --> 39:41.466
You could win.

39:43.859 --> 39:45.513
No, no.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.297
We tried fighting power
with power

39:47.341 --> 39:50.518
and we just ended up
hurting the people
we were trying to help.

39:50.562 --> 39:51.998
I'm not making
that mistake again.

39:54.435 --> 39:55.697
Then what do we do?

39:57.177 --> 39:58.134
I need to think.

40:02.443 --> 40:05.185
Perhaps we should call in
some measure of reinforcements.

40:05.228 --> 40:06.099
We wait.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.406
Give Supergirl a chance.

40:26.598 --> 40:29.905
<i>Mama, why isn't anyone
helping us?</i>

40:29.949 --> 40:32.604
<i>I have no power
to fight this.</i>

40:33.300 --> 40:35.476
<i>I give up.</i>

40:35.520 --> 40:38.914
<i>But you can't give up!
We can never give up.</i>

40:41.526 --> 40:44.659
Like the world around you
is crumbling,

40:44.703 --> 40:47.793
and I know exactly
what you're thinking.

40:47.836 --> 40:49.577
How can I tell you it's not

40:49.621 --> 40:52.232
when you see
it all falling apart
before your own eyes?

40:53.625 --> 40:57.193
I am not telling you
to deny your reality.

40:57.237 --> 41:00.762
I'm only telling you
to embrace your strength.

41:00.806 --> 41:03.939
They cannot make you
feel hopeless.

41:03.983 --> 41:07.508
They cannot take
your ability to love.

41:07.552 --> 41:10.424
And they cannot convince you
that the truth is a lie.

41:11.817 --> 41:14.646
Not when you know it
in your heart.

41:14.689 --> 41:18.998
Your power is yours,
and no one can take that
from you.

41:20.652 --> 41:24.960
So stay strong. Be strong.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.093
And live on to fight
another day.

41:36.972 --> 41:38.017
J'onn...

41:39.279 --> 41:40.454
I know what we need to do.
