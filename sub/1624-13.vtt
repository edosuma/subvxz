WEBVTT

00:01.592 --> 00:02.512
One steak sandwich

00:02.513 --> 00:04.561
and a cheeseburger with muenster cheese.

00:04.562 --> 00:05.571
We're out of muenster.

00:05.572 --> 00:07.507
Oh, since when?

00:07.508 --> 00:09.500
Well, let's see, the
diner opened in '82.

00:09.501 --> 00:12.582
So '82.

00:12.583 --> 00:15.507
Hi, sorry but we're out of muenster.

00:15.508 --> 00:16.556
Seriously, dude?

00:16.557 --> 00:17.558
I wanted muenster.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.511
Sorry, we have cheddar,
Swiss or American.

00:20.512 --> 00:22.574
I hate cheddar and Swiss blows.

00:22.575 --> 00:24.545
Well...Then American?

00:24.546 --> 00:25.548
American cheese?

00:25.549 --> 00:26.592
What am I, at grade school?

00:26.593 --> 00:29.499
Yeah, go to the principal's office.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.588
I can't have another idiot
up my ass right now.

00:30.589 --> 00:34.524
It's at capacity.

00:34.525 --> 00:36.532
Max, I got this.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.511
Would you like to see the menu again?

00:39.512 --> 00:41.502
This is crap, okay, I wanted muenster.

00:41.503 --> 00:43.562
Well, I wanted to be running
a Fortune 500 company

00:43.563 --> 00:46.516
instead of waiting on a toxic
man-child like yourself.

00:46.517 --> 00:48.582
But, we can't always get what we want.

00:48.583 --> 00:51.511
So, order something else,
put it in your pie hole

00:51.512 --> 00:54.574
and get on with your damn life.

00:54.575 --> 00:55.575
Welcome to waitress.

00:55.576 --> 00:59.511
We've been expecting you.

00:59.512 --> 01:01.571
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh #

01:03.304 --> 01:06.304
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh #

01:12.979 --> 01:13.988
Here you go, table ten, Earl.

01:13.989 --> 01:16.928
Have any exciting plans for tomorrow?

01:16.929 --> 01:18.949
Just trying to not die in my sleep, Max.

01:18.950 --> 01:23.911
How about you?

01:23.912 --> 01:24.973
I'm going to visit Caroline's horse.

01:24.974 --> 01:26.936
He was adopted by a rich white lady

01:26.937 --> 01:28.946
who could give him everything
we couldn't afford to.

01:28.947 --> 01:30.970
Which is everything.

01:30.971 --> 01:35.941
White people will adopt anything.

01:35.942 --> 01:37.995
I figured out the best
way to go see Chestnut.

01:37.996 --> 01:38.994
We take the J train to the 4,

01:38.995 --> 01:39.996
the 4 to Grand Central,

01:39.997 --> 01:41.932
change trains to Riverdale

01:41.933 --> 01:43.921
and walk three blocks to
his fancy new stable.

01:43.922 --> 01:46.911
Sounds exotic. Do I need a travel shot?

01:46.912 --> 01:48.933
No, but there's a dicey
underpass at Grand Central

01:48.934 --> 01:50.932
where we might get shot.

01:50.933 --> 01:53.899
I am so excited to see my baby again.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.924
Me too.

01:54.925 --> 01:55.944
In the Lifetime movie version,

01:55.945 --> 01:56.954
we get there and Chestnut likes

01:56.955 --> 01:59.945
his new home better and then we cry.

01:59.946 --> 02:01.907
Excuse me, Hi.

02:01.908 --> 02:02.933
Sorry to bother you.

02:02.934 --> 02:04.995
I'm Rhya, I'm a little embarrassed.

02:04.996 --> 02:06.907
I just got my period.

02:06.908 --> 02:09.973
Mazel tov.

02:09.975 --> 02:11.916
Do either of you have a tampon?

02:11.917 --> 02:12.953
Not me.

02:12.954 --> 02:13.992
I just go off into the
woods and don't come out

02:13.993 --> 02:15.991
until it's over.

02:15.992 --> 02:18.903
I have one.

02:18.904 --> 02:19.925
I'm so sorry to bother you guys.

02:19.926 --> 02:23.899
No problem, "Sisterhood of
the Traveling Panty Shields"

02:23.900 --> 02:24.981
Actually, no, I don't have one.

02:24.982 --> 02:26.927
Here's a quarter, there's
a tampon machine

02:26.928 --> 02:27.988
in the ladies' room. Thanks.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.925
Pick up, table six.

02:30.926 --> 02:32.899
I couldn't help overhear.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.900
I have tampon.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.907
Oleg, why do you have a tampon?

02:41.908 --> 02:44.899
Same reason I carry a lighter,
even though I don't smoke.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.920
Feels good to be the hero.

02:47.921 --> 02:49.978
Sorry, again, but do you
have any more change?

02:49.979 --> 02:51.903
It's 75 cents.

02:51.904 --> 02:52.902
It's a quarter.

02:52.903 --> 02:53.988
75. Says so on the machine.

02:53.989 --> 02:57.988
It better not or I'm about
to rage against the machine.

03:01.996 --> 03:05.911
What?

03:05.912 --> 03:08.907
Han, I need to see you in here now.

03:08.908 --> 03:09.975
But that is the ladies' room.

03:09.976 --> 03:10.973
You're fine.

03:10.974 --> 03:11.975
Women bring their little boys

03:11.976 --> 03:15.953
in here all the time.

03:15.954 --> 03:18.903
Everybody decent?

03:18.904 --> 03:19.948
Man in the ladies' room.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.944
I apologize for personal intrusion.

03:21.945 --> 03:22.983
You don't have to cover your eyes.

03:22.984 --> 03:24.995
It's a ladies' room,
not a solar eclipse.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.957
Max, why do you want to see me

03:26.958 --> 03:28.919
in this inappropriate meeting place?

03:28.920 --> 03:29.996
This is why. The tampon machine.

03:29.997 --> 03:32.924
Oh, this is not man topic.

03:32.925 --> 03:34.924
I do not wish to discuss
time of the month

03:34.925 --> 03:37.928
when ladies must chase the cotton mouse.

03:37.929 --> 03:39.920
Chase the cotton mouse?

03:39.921 --> 03:41.906
Geeze, where'd you get
your sex education?

03:41.907 --> 03:42.977
Lambchop's playalong?

03:42.978 --> 03:44.958
Han, you changed the price of tampons?

03:44.959 --> 03:46.958
Yes, this is not appropriate talk.

03:46.959 --> 03:48.970
No, this is not appropriate action.

03:48.971 --> 03:49.988
They've been a quarter forever.

03:49.989 --> 03:51.920
Look how old this machine is.

03:51.921 --> 03:53.978
Harriet Tubman used to
get her tampons here.

03:53.979 --> 03:55.932
I'm a businessman.

03:55.933 --> 03:56.971
Emphasis on the man.

03:56.972 --> 03:58.920
I do not belong in here.

03:58.921 --> 03:59.949
Hey, hey!

03:59.950 --> 04:03.911
Don't make me chase you,
you little khaki mouse.

04:03.912 --> 04:05.944
Look, han, everyone knows
there are certain things

04:05.945 --> 04:06.965
that people need in an emergency

04:06.966 --> 04:08.923
that you never raise the price on.

04:08.924 --> 04:09.936
Things like what?

04:09.937 --> 04:10.950
Off the top of my head,

04:10.951 --> 04:13.995
tampons and 40-ounce beers.

04:13.996 --> 04:15.978
Max, why are you so upset?

04:15.979 --> 04:17.923
It is only two more quarters.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.987
Han, that's a 200% price hike.

04:19.988 --> 04:21.906
That's outrageous.

04:21.908 --> 04:22.931
You're taking advantage of women.

04:22.932 --> 04:24.915
If men were the ones who got periods,

04:24.916 --> 04:25.962
tampons would be thrown free

04:25.963 --> 04:28.916
from floats like Mardi Gras beads.

04:28.917 --> 04:30.928
I went to Mardi Gras once... I was 11.

04:30.929 --> 04:31.992
My mom and her new
boyfriend wanted to go,

04:31.993 --> 04:35.911
and they needed a designated driver.

04:35.912 --> 04:37.911
Earl, I need a man's opinion.

04:37.912 --> 04:39.907
Is it my right to raise the price

04:39.908 --> 04:40.965
of any product in my diner?

04:40.966 --> 04:41.996
What product are we talking about?

04:41.997 --> 04:43.903
Tampons.

04:43.904 --> 04:45.957
Oh, brother.

04:45.958 --> 04:48.982
Uh, you gotta just relax and butt out.

04:48.983 --> 04:49.991
Trust me.

04:49.992 --> 04:52.903
I been in this situation a long time.

04:52.904 --> 04:53.925
Remember Aunt Flo?

04:53.926 --> 04:56.941
That was my aunt.

04:56.942 --> 04:58.902
Han, just because you can take advantage

04:58.903 --> 05:00.908
of a business situation,
doesn't mean you should.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.907
It is law of supply and demand.

05:02.908 --> 05:05.907
Fine, then I demand you roll
back the price on the supply.

05:05.908 --> 05:07.911
Come on han, don't be so 1% about it.

05:07.912 --> 05:08.992
You think occupy Wall
Street was a big deal?

05:08.993 --> 05:12.907
Wait till you see occupy tampon.

05:12.908 --> 05:13.992
We only protest once a month,

05:13.993 --> 05:16.992
but it's an intense five to seven days.

05:21.633 --> 05:22.656
Got it. Found the milk.

05:22.657 --> 05:24.638
And I found it even
faster than the butter.

05:24.639 --> 05:27.607
You know they're not hiding it from you.

05:27.608 --> 05:29.696
It's a grocery store, not a
sorority scavenger hunt.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.632
Grocery shopping is so fun.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.667
When I was little, I always wondered

05:33.668 --> 05:36.667
where this stuff came from.

05:39.646 --> 05:40.682
What's that?

05:40.683 --> 05:41.683
Birthday card for my mom.

05:41.684 --> 05:45.616
Aww, let me see.

05:45.617 --> 05:46.636
"Get better soon"?

05:46.637 --> 05:47.694
I thought you said it
was a birthday card.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.658
It is, that's the only one that seemed

05:49.659 --> 05:51.661
appropriate for our relationship.

05:51.662 --> 05:53.617
Do you really want your mom to get

05:53.618 --> 05:55.649
a get well card on her birthday?

05:55.650 --> 05:57.679
Okay...Here's one with a
strawberry, that's fine.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.599
It's really about the
50 bucks inside anyway.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.633
That makes me sad.

06:02.634 --> 06:06.641
Sad? I can fix that.

06:06.642 --> 06:08.612
Have a treat, it'll
perk you right back up.

06:08.613 --> 06:10.666
Max, you just stabbed a bag of candy.

06:10.667 --> 06:11.679
That's okay, they'll just think a gang

06:11.680 --> 06:13.682
came through and did it.

06:13.683 --> 06:14.688
A candy gang?

06:14.689 --> 06:18.661
What, like the sour patch kids?

06:18.662 --> 06:20.682
Just step away and pretend
you didn't do it.

06:20.683 --> 06:24.624
That's what you do.

06:24.625 --> 06:25.694
We just need to grab ten boxes

06:25.695 --> 06:27.660
of Duncan Hines cake mix and we're done.

06:27.661 --> 06:28.692
Why would we need to do that?

06:28.693 --> 06:31.603
Why do you think? To make the cupcakes.

06:31.604 --> 06:33.645
I thought the cupcakes were homemade.

06:33.646 --> 06:37.661
They are, I make them in my home.

06:37.662 --> 06:40.632
You've been using a boxed cake mix?

06:40.633 --> 06:42.649
Relax, I only use it when I'm tired.

06:42.650 --> 06:44.660
And I add a secret ingredient
of my own to the mix

06:44.661 --> 06:45.679
that makes them irresistible.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.657
So you have no shame using
the store-bought mix?

06:48.658 --> 06:52.599
I've no shame about anything.
Shame is overrated like Ke$ha.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.607
In fact, they should
rename shame "keshame"

06:56.608 --> 07:02.678
I just bought a Ke$ha
album, I'm so keshamed.

07:02.679 --> 07:04.652
Shouldn't there be someone
to do this for us?

07:04.653 --> 07:05.656
Oh, he's probably in the aisle

07:05.657 --> 07:06.679
cleaning up after the candy gang.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.607
There was no candy gang in here tonight.

07:09.608 --> 07:13.695
That was a sneaky
customer, now wasn't it?

07:13.696 --> 07:15.603
Hey, look.

07:15.604 --> 07:17.599
For Chestnut, I can't wait.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.683
I got him the kind with tops
on them, like Bugs Bunny.

07:18.684 --> 07:21.620
He'll be so excited when he
sees the two of us tomorrow.

07:21.621 --> 07:22.641
I know.

07:22.642 --> 07:25.616
I was talking about me and the carrots.

07:25.617 --> 07:28.695
All right now, your total is $70.49.

07:28.696 --> 07:30.691
Wow, that seems like a lot.

07:30.692 --> 07:34.599
I don't make the prices, now do I?

07:34.600 --> 07:36.657
No, I was just commenting.

07:36.658 --> 07:41.632
Well, it's not CNN, now is it?

07:41.633 --> 07:44.661
- Here, give her the coupons.
- The coupons?

07:44.662 --> 07:46.616
Yeah, here.

07:46.617 --> 07:49.628
Max, you use coupons?

07:49.629 --> 07:51.670
I had no idea.

07:51.671 --> 07:56.657
You're looking at me like
I'm on To Catch a Predator.

07:56.658 --> 07:59.603
We don't need to use those, I
have my tip money right here.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.628
What are you talking
about, I have coupons.

08:01.629 --> 08:03.629
Here, take them.

08:06.679 --> 08:08.657
I...I have...

08:08.658 --> 08:10.607
I can't, I don't want to.

08:10.608 --> 08:11.688
I've fallen so far, I
can't fall any further.

08:11.689 --> 08:14.616
Don't make me.

08:14.617 --> 08:17.645
There's no need to go
down a keshame spiral.

08:17.646 --> 08:18.692
Hi, she has coupons.

08:18.693 --> 08:21.624
Oh, now you tell me you have coupons?

08:21.625 --> 08:23.670
Should have told me
before, now shouldn't ya?

08:23.671 --> 08:25.678
I didn't wanna tell you
at all, she made me.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.687
Now didn't ya?

08:28.688 --> 08:30.691
Look, it's not a big deal.

08:30.692 --> 08:31.688
Lots of people use coupons.

08:31.689 --> 08:33.620
Coupons are for...

08:33.621 --> 08:34.692
poor people, yes.

08:34.693 --> 08:35.690
Like us.

08:35.691 --> 08:37.602
People who stand at the cash register

08:37.602 --> 08:38.645
and say things like,

08:38.647 --> 08:41.620
"Wow, $70? That seems like a lot."

08:41.621 --> 08:44.666
Your new total is $12.70.

08:44.667 --> 08:47.657
Wait, it just went from $70 to $12?

08:47.658 --> 08:48.662
Just like that?

08:48.663 --> 08:50.653
The same food for less money?

08:50.654 --> 08:52.661
The exact same food?

08:52.662 --> 08:54.599
How is that even possible?

08:54.600 --> 08:57.674
You used coupons, now didn't ya.

08:57.675 --> 09:00.675
Max, coupons are genius.

09:04.696 --> 09:06.657
I'm late, I know.

09:06.658 --> 09:08.606
I just got a text from Chestnut.

09:08.607 --> 09:09.608
"Where are you?

09:09.609 --> 09:11.607
I'm wearing my best suit."

09:11.608 --> 09:13.696
He spelled suit with a four, but
that's pretty good for a horse.

09:13.697 --> 09:15.691
I have a good reason.

09:15.692 --> 09:18.620
15 chicken pot pies.

09:18.621 --> 09:20.620
Regular price: $1.47.

09:20.621 --> 09:21.696
Coupon price: Free!

09:21.697 --> 09:23.666
'Cause I bought 15 and used

09:23.667 --> 09:25.619
the double coupon in-store sale combo.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.615
Listen to me with the lingo already.

09:27.616 --> 09:29.688
Reminds me of my first day
interning on Wall Street.

09:29.689 --> 09:31.682
Chicken pot pies?

09:31.683 --> 09:33.657
You don't even like them.

09:33.658 --> 09:35.598
What does it matter if
I like them or not?

09:35.599 --> 09:36.598
They were free.

09:36.599 --> 09:37.598
It's free money.

09:37.599 --> 09:38.610
Who doesn't like free money?

09:38.611 --> 09:39.640
I don't know about free money,

09:39.641 --> 09:40.654
but this is like watching someone

09:40.655 --> 09:43.620
free base for the first time.

09:43.621 --> 09:44.656
Chestnut's fine.

09:44.657 --> 09:45.696
It's not a big deal.

09:45.697 --> 09:48.695
Ooh, oh, I just got another
text from Chestnut.

09:48.696 --> 09:52.628
"I'm so lonely, I just tried smoking."

09:52.629 --> 09:53.696
We can go tomorrow.

09:53.697 --> 09:55.657
In the Lifetime movie version,

09:55.658 --> 09:57.662
we just missed the day we
were appointed by the court,

09:57.663 --> 10:00.599
and Chestnut's new parents
move him out of town.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.691
And we cry.

10:01.692 --> 10:03.695
I get it, it's just
that after last night,

10:03.696 --> 10:06.645
I woke up fascinated by
the concept of coupons.

10:06.646 --> 10:07.683
So I did some research.

10:07.684 --> 10:09.599
I found this woman online

10:09.600 --> 10:11.661
who calls herself the
Williamsburg Coupon Queen.

10:11.662 --> 10:13.611
Only she calls them "cue-pons."

10:13.612 --> 10:14.665
Is that the correct way to pronounce it?

10:14.666 --> 10:15.683
Eh, I'm gonna go with her way

10:15.684 --> 10:19.611
after all, she is the queen.

10:19.612 --> 10:20.667
Canned pumpkin?

10:20.668 --> 10:23.674
Ten cans, double coupon,
five cents each.

10:23.675 --> 10:25.662
Great, 'cause I'm always
lying in bed at night

10:25.663 --> 10:28.628
thinking I wish I could crack
open a can of pumpkin.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.599
Oh, and I found a coupon for
you to send your mom an

10:31.600 --> 10:32.654
edible arrangement for her birthday.

10:32.655 --> 10:36.653
A pretty pineapple daisy says so
much more than cash in a card.

10:36.654 --> 10:40.599
And it's for 40% off the regular price.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.691
That's perfect because my mom
was 40% off a regular mom.

10:43.692 --> 10:46.695
And Max, I do have something
else for you in this bag.

10:46.696 --> 10:49.632
Something that'll make you very happy.

10:49.633 --> 10:52.624
Canned yams for when I get
tired of canned pumpkin?

10:52.625 --> 10:56.695
Better, look.

10:56.696 --> 10:58.695
Look out, Han Lee.

10:58.696 --> 11:01.696
I'm about to get my tamp on.

11:06.650 --> 11:08.695
Well well, if it isn't
everything that's wrong

11:08.696 --> 11:12.696
with the current economy,
in a boys' v-neck sweater.

11:14.683 --> 11:16.691
Oh, what do you think you are doing?

11:16.692 --> 11:20.692
Oh, just putting straws
in the container...

11:22.633 --> 11:26.678
In case, uh...

11:26.679 --> 11:29.607
Just in case a woman might
suddenly need a straw

11:29.608 --> 11:31.632
and not have 75 cents.

11:31.633 --> 11:32.696
Those are not straws.

11:32.697 --> 11:34.649
They do not belong in public.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.607
Didn't your mother ever teach you

11:36.608 --> 11:39.678
that is secret, no-no
private lady thing?

11:39.679 --> 11:41.687
You can't even say the name.

11:41.688 --> 11:43.642
Come on Wall Street, if you can sell it,

11:43.643 --> 11:46.653
you should be able to
bring yourself to say it.

11:46.654 --> 11:48.600
I will never speak of it.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.616
Just say it. Tampon, tampon, tampon.

11:51.617 --> 11:53.616
What's the big deal?

11:53.617 --> 11:55.678
In Ukraine, there are
pop songs about it.

11:55.679 --> 11:57.696
She's so pretty, she's so grouchy.

12:07.638 --> 12:09.631
That is inappropriate counter display.

12:09.632 --> 12:10.636
You take it down.

12:10.637 --> 12:11.688
You take down the price and I will.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.637
No, it is free market.

12:13.638 --> 12:14.638
I charge what I want.

12:14.639 --> 12:16.661
I am the boss.

12:16.662 --> 12:19.682
Max, someone left a stack of
newspapers filled with cue-pons,

12:19.683 --> 12:22.649
and look, a double for Duncan Hines.

12:22.650 --> 12:23.692
Could this day get any better?

12:23.693 --> 12:26.620
Oh, and tables four, seven
and eight want their checks.

12:26.621 --> 12:27.620
Okay.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.621
Have 'em ready right here.

12:33.646 --> 12:36.628
Max, no, that is private!

12:36.629 --> 12:37.673
Here's your check.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.696
And a little something extra,

12:38.697 --> 12:42.678
compliments of women without
three quarters everywhere.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.649
Thank you very much.

12:44.650 --> 12:45.658
I don't know about your flow,

12:45.659 --> 12:48.658
so I gave you a regular and a super.

12:55.617 --> 12:56.692
Max, have you no shame?

12:56.693 --> 12:57.682
Nope.

12:57.683 --> 12:59.687
Ladies, at that time of the month,

12:59.688 --> 13:01.621
I invite you to think of this man.

13:01.622 --> 13:03.649
This man, Han Lee, right over here.

13:03.650 --> 13:07.650
The man who thinks your menses
should be more expenses.

13:09.654 --> 13:10.696
Okay, okay, I will lower the price

13:10.697 --> 13:12.616
back to a quarter.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.657
And that is end of discussion, period.

13:14.658 --> 13:17.678
Oh.

13:17.679 --> 13:21.679
Tampons for everyone.

13:23.621 --> 13:27.621
Max, you are the Norma
Rae of feminine hygiene.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.866
It's so windy.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.870
Choosing coupon shopping over
going to see your son again?

13:47.871 --> 13:49.841
That's a keshame.

13:49.842 --> 13:50.865
In the Lifetime movie version,

13:50.866 --> 13:52.877
this is where they take you
away as an unfit mother.

13:52.878 --> 13:53.879
And I don't cry.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.841
I'm sorry, but I just saw

13:55.842 --> 13:57.857
that all these cake mix
cue-pons expire today.

13:57.858 --> 13:58.865
I'll be real quick.

13:58.866 --> 13:59.886
Ten minutes, in and out.

13:59.887 --> 14:01.831
If I had a cue-pon for every time

14:01.832 --> 14:02.840
I heard that from a guy.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.819
Here, start going through these papers

14:04.820 --> 14:06.800
and look for the cake
mix double cue-pon.

14:06.801 --> 14:08.824
If I combine these with
the in-store bonus,

14:08.825 --> 14:11.799
not only will we get the
lower cue-pon mix price,

14:11.800 --> 14:14.812
but they will actually give us $23 back!

14:15.858 --> 14:18.853
I'll give you $24 to
stop saying cue-pon.

14:18.854 --> 14:21.824
Come on, start pulling out
the ones for the cake mix.

14:21.825 --> 14:26.857
It'll be a breeze.

14:26.858 --> 14:28.820
No, that was a breeze.

14:28.821 --> 14:30.828
My cue-pons!

14:30.829 --> 14:32.858
The fact that you're more
worried about your coupons

14:32.859 --> 14:36.858
than your hair shows
how far you've fallen.

14:40.808 --> 14:41.862
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

14:41.863 --> 14:44.824
Max, it's the Williamsburg
cue-pon queen.

14:44.825 --> 14:46.828
Where'd she leave her
crown, in the minivan?

14:46.829 --> 14:48.877
This is so exciting.
I have to go pay my respects.

14:48.878 --> 14:49.886
We don't have time for this.

14:49.887 --> 14:51.829
Just throw the cake mix into the cart

14:51.830 --> 14:55.841
or we'll miss the train.

14:55.842 --> 14:57.832
There, calm down, have a treat.

14:57.833 --> 15:00.811
I'll be right back.

15:00.812 --> 15:01.888
Excuse me, your highness,

15:01.889 --> 15:03.887
but aren't you the cue-pon queen?

15:03.888 --> 15:04.887
Mm-hmm.

15:04.888 --> 15:06.849
I'm Caroline.

15:06.850 --> 15:07.883
Freddie, and I can't talk right now

15:07.884 --> 15:09.832
because if I lose my place...

15:09.833 --> 15:10.879
- you'll lose your mind!
- I'm gonna lose...My...Mind...

15:10.880 --> 15:13.811
I know. You say that on your show.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.848
I won't bother you, but I
think you'll be excited

15:15.849 --> 15:16.846
when I tell you that
it's only my second day

15:16.847 --> 15:18.832
and I already learned

15:18.833 --> 15:20.802
how to make money on the
purchase of cake mix.

15:20.803 --> 15:22.812
All I have to do is buy 40
boxes and we get the...

15:22.813 --> 15:24.845
store bonus, yeah.

15:24.846 --> 15:29.837
Cake mix... That's a rare cue-pon.

15:29.838 --> 15:30.836
Where'd you find it?

15:30.837 --> 15:31.848
Yesterday's circulars.

15:31.849 --> 15:32.850
Didn't you see it?

15:32.851 --> 15:34.845
I missed it.

15:34.846 --> 15:39.849
Go to the truck and get the
stockpile of circulars.

15:39.850 --> 15:41.887
Look at him go.

15:41.888 --> 15:44.816
You're sweeping the shelves.

15:44.817 --> 15:46.883
On your show, you said sweeping
the shelves was out of line.

15:46.884 --> 15:48.882
Max!

15:48.883 --> 15:50.857
These are mine, I was here first.

15:50.858 --> 15:52.857
I think she's probably
gonna be here last,

15:52.858 --> 15:54.799
so let's go, we don't need these.

15:54.800 --> 15:55.856
We do, if we don't get 40 boxes,

15:55.857 --> 15:56.896
they won't be free.

15:56.897 --> 15:59.896
I've met actual queens and
this isn't royal behavior.

16:02.854 --> 16:06.799
Max, she just body-checked me.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.888
Push me again and I will report
you to the American embassy.

16:08.889 --> 16:11.888
Max, get in here.

16:14.842 --> 16:18.824
Oh, we got a problem?

16:18.825 --> 16:20.878
Oh, we got a problem.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.879
Oh, hell no!

16:30.896 --> 16:32.828
What do we do?

16:32.829 --> 16:34.837
You step away and pretend
you didn't do it.

16:34.838 --> 16:38.807
That's what you do.

16:38.808 --> 16:39.837
24, 25...

16:39.838 --> 16:41.853
you're making me wait, now aren't ya?

16:41.854 --> 16:42.838
Just till I get to 40.

16:43.862 --> 16:45.837
26, 27, 28.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.824
Come on, I'll buy it for you.

16:48.825 --> 16:49.858
Come on, take up the bitch on his offer

16:49.859 --> 16:51.824
and let's go see Chestnut.

16:51.825 --> 16:52.856
Max, shh, I'm counting.

16:52.857 --> 16:54.892
If we don't have the exact
right mix-to-coupon ratio

16:54.893 --> 16:56.849
we won't get our free money.

16:56.850 --> 16:57.883
Okay, where was I?

16:57.884 --> 16:59.828
Amateur.

16:59.829 --> 17:00.896
Real mature, your highness.

17:00.897 --> 17:03.811
We have places to go.

17:03.812 --> 17:04.810
Okay, 40.

17:04.811 --> 17:06.819
Take it away, Tanya.

17:06.820 --> 17:07.848
Wait, what is this?

17:07.848 --> 17:09.836
This isn't Duncan Hines, it's Pillsbury.

17:09.837 --> 17:10.838
Where did this come from?

17:10.839 --> 17:11.836
I put it in.

17:11.837 --> 17:12.842
You can't do that.

17:12.843 --> 17:14.824
It has to be all Duncan Hines.

17:14.825 --> 17:15.836
I needed Pillsbury.

17:15.837 --> 17:16.836
Well, you can't have it.

17:16.837 --> 17:17.836
- I need it!
- Why?

17:17.837 --> 17:18.871
- I need it!
- Why?

17:18.872 --> 17:21.824
That's the secret ingredient.

17:21.825 --> 17:23.845
I throw a spoon of Pillsbury

17:23.846 --> 17:24.887
in the Duncan Hines.

17:24.888 --> 17:26.810
Pillsbury?

17:26.811 --> 17:27.838
That's what makes it you?

17:27.839 --> 17:30.853
That's what makes it more delicious.

17:30.854 --> 17:32.828
Tanya, stop, flag on the play.

17:32.829 --> 17:33.886
Here, take this back

17:33.887 --> 17:34.890
and get me another.

17:34.891 --> 17:36.802
You know what, I'm just gonna go

17:36.803 --> 17:37.836
see Chestnut while I still have time.

17:37.837 --> 17:39.810
No, Max, please take this
back and get me another one.

17:39.811 --> 17:40.846
You're the one who wanted to use

17:40.847 --> 17:43.807
the store-bought mix instead of
making your own from scratch.

17:43.808 --> 17:44.888
So go back and get me another mix.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.816
I used the mix because I don't
know how to make my own.

17:47.817 --> 17:48.819
No one ever taught me.

17:48.820 --> 17:49.856
No one taught me how to bake.

17:49.857 --> 17:51.815
No one taught me how to use tampons.

17:51.816 --> 17:52.846
No one taught me anything.

17:52.847 --> 17:55.799
You still think I should
send my mom a better gift?

17:55.800 --> 17:59.807
And no one taught you how
to check out, either.

17:59.808 --> 18:01.816
I'm going.

18:01.817 --> 18:02.849
Max.

18:02.850 --> 18:04.836
You need to get another
mix, now don't ya?

18:04.837 --> 18:06.821
I'll go get it, won't take a minute.

18:07.858 --> 18:11.858
Who's the queen now?

18:14.858 --> 18:16.824
Hey, my dude.

18:16.825 --> 18:18.891
Look at you and your fancy coat.

18:18.892 --> 18:21.874
Retirement looks good on you.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.841
Told you I'd come by to see you.

18:23.842 --> 18:24.896
Hooked you up with some carrots.

18:24.897 --> 18:29.853
Bugs Bunny status, like I know you like.

18:29.854 --> 18:31.891
I, uh, I don't know if you got my text.

18:31.892 --> 18:35.824
Probably not a great
signal in here, but...

18:35.825 --> 18:36.883
Your mom might be a little late.

18:36.884 --> 18:40.870
She's coming though 'cause I
know she's dying to see you.

18:40.871 --> 18:41.879
All right, man, who am I kidding?

18:41.880 --> 18:44.841
She's not coming.

18:44.842 --> 18:45.846
I know that's hard to hear,

18:45.847 --> 18:47.853
and trust me, mothers not showing up,

18:47.854 --> 18:48.854
I've been there.

18:48.855 --> 18:50.878
But, I know wherever she is,

18:50.879 --> 18:53.832
she is thinking of you.

18:53.833 --> 18:54.838
Okay, that's not true either.

18:54.839 --> 18:56.849
Here's the thing.

18:56.850 --> 18:58.799
Your mom is a flake.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.825
And you got two options,

18:59.826 --> 19:01.849
you can sit around feeling
sorry for yourself

19:01.850 --> 19:04.799
or you can say, "Hey,
my mom's not here."

19:04.800 --> 19:06.857
"I can watch TV all day
and then go kick in

19:06.858 --> 19:09.845
a neighbor's window
because I feel like it."

19:09.846 --> 19:10.857
Hey.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.799
Hey, look at me.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.841
The fact that she's not
here is not your fault.

19:14.842 --> 19:16.849
It's hers.

19:16.850 --> 19:17.871
There, I just saved you, like,

19:17.872 --> 19:20.871
14 inappropriate sexual encounters.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.799
Hi.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.866
Hey.

19:25.867 --> 19:27.874
Hi, Chestnut!

19:27.875 --> 19:29.845
Hi, baby.

19:29.846 --> 19:31.807
Aw...

19:31.808 --> 19:32.849
I missed you.

19:32.850 --> 19:34.807
I missed you so much.

19:34.808 --> 19:35.867
Did you miss me?

19:35.868 --> 19:37.820
So you got all the cake mix?

19:37.821 --> 19:39.861
Yes, plus the $23.

19:39.862 --> 19:41.874
And I got you your Pillsbury as well.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.845
Paid full price... it killed me.

19:43.846 --> 19:45.866
You are a freak with the coupons.

19:45.867 --> 19:46.874
I know.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.849
I don't know what came over me.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.804
When I found a way to make free money

19:50.805 --> 19:52.841
I forgot about everyone else.

19:52.842 --> 19:53.870
Oh, my God.

19:53.871 --> 19:55.832
Like my father.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.849
Max, I have Ponzi DNA.

19:57.850 --> 20:01.853
Yeah, cou-Ponzi DNA.

20:01.854 --> 20:03.896
Must have been hard learning
to do everything on your own.

20:03.897 --> 20:06.807
I mean, I don't know how to
do any of that stuff either,

20:06.808 --> 20:07.875
but, I had a staff of 20.

20:07.876 --> 20:11.845
Yeah, I got staph at 20.

20:11.846 --> 20:14.832
You know, you may think
your secret ingredient

20:14.833 --> 20:16.837
is a spoonful of Pillsbury,

20:16.838 --> 20:17.853
but it's not.

20:17.854 --> 20:18.866
It's you.

20:18.867 --> 20:20.819
It's everything you've been through

20:20.820 --> 20:21.846
that makes you who you are.

20:21.847 --> 20:23.882
Someone who fights for a box of tampons

20:23.883 --> 20:25.857
and fights for a horse's feelings

20:25.858 --> 20:27.874
and even fights for a box of cake mix

20:27.875 --> 20:32.803
when a friend in the middle of a
cue-Ponzi panic, asks her to.

20:32.804 --> 20:34.807
This is the part in the
lifetime movie version

20:34.808 --> 20:37.878
where I get up to pee.

20:37.879 --> 20:39.804
I don't know who you're kidding.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.853
You watch the entire
movie and then you cry.

20:41.854 --> 20:42.875
Listen to her, Chestnut.

20:42.876 --> 20:45.820
She thinks she has me all figured out.

20:45.821 --> 20:47.842
What she doesn't know is that
when it comes to the cupcakes,

20:47.843 --> 20:50.845
I have another secret,
secret ingredient.

20:50.846 --> 20:52.833
Oh, don't tell me it's a
pinch of Betty Crocker.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.803
I can't tell you.
It's a secret ingredient.

20:56.804 --> 20:59.799
Okay, it's chocolate methamphetamine.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.807
No, it's true.

21:00.808 --> 21:01.806
Our slogan should be:

21:01.807 --> 21:02.808
They're so good,

21:02.809 --> 21:04.808
you'll rob your grandmother.
