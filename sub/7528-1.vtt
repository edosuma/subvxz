03:06.938 --> 03:07.981
What do you want, Rocco?

03:08.565 --> 03:09.732
What we all want.

03:10.275 --> 03:13.444
To not die young, poor or alone.

03:13.528 --> 03:14.529
Manny...

03:14.779 --> 03:17.407
These guys, they...

03:17.490 --> 03:20.076
I don't give them what they're after,

03:20.159 --> 03:22.078
they'll kill me.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.372
Hold it, Rocco.

03:24.831 --> 03:27.083
We don't fight these guys.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.918
Sure, maybe you get that...

03:29.794 --> 03:31.212
- Shit. God damn it.
- Cut!

03:32.463 --> 03:33.631
- Props!
- Cut.

03:33.715 --> 03:34.757
Sorry, everyone.

03:34.841 --> 03:36.426
- We're going again, Eddie.
- I don't know what happened.

03:36.509 --> 03:37.510
Sorry, Sam.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.471
Of course, the one day
the author is among us.

03:40.722 --> 03:42.724
Among us. Sure as hell ain't one of us.

03:43.892 --> 03:46.394
What's my brilliant line, Trumbo?

03:46.477 --> 03:48.479
Oh! I've got it right here.

03:48.730 --> 03:52.233
"Hold it, Rocco. Now if...
If we don't fight these guys,

03:52.317 --> 03:56.195
"sure, maybe you get that
long, happy life we all want."

03:57.864 --> 03:59.365
So, what do you got me fighting for then?

04:00.074 --> 04:03.745
Well, peace on Earth.
Good will toward men.

04:03.828 --> 04:05.330
Well, you can't do that. This is America.

04:06.873 --> 04:09.876
All right. How about sex and money?

04:10.501 --> 04:12.670
There you go. Two things we all love.

04:12.754 --> 04:13.796
Well...

04:13.880 --> 04:15.965
One of your little sermons on citizenship.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.343
All right, going again.

04:20.011 --> 04:21.596
Mayer lined up the A Team.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.515
Sam Wood to shoot,
Dalton Trumbo for rewrites.

04:24.599 --> 04:25.767
I had no crew, I couldn't work.

04:25.850 --> 04:26.893
So, good, fingers crossed

04:26.976 --> 04:27.977
You wouldn't work.

04:28.061 --> 04:31.230
God forbid you cross a picket
line for set builders.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.192
What the hell do set builders
have to do with writing?

04:35.109 --> 04:38.446
What writers write, builders build.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.740
What they build, you shoot.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.867
Now, you make all the money
you possibly can.

04:42.951 --> 04:45.954
So do I. Why shouldn't they?
And why can't we help them?

04:46.037 --> 04:48.331
Listen to you, the swimming pool Soviet.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.208
Oh, for God's sakes, you won!

04:50.291 --> 04:52.418
Sam, the strike is over.

04:52.502 --> 04:54.629
And you just might try
being a gracious winner!

04:54.712 --> 04:56.506
You know, it's never over with you people!

04:56.714 --> 04:57.966
Strike after strike after strike!

04:58.049 --> 04:59.342
"You people"?

04:59.425 --> 05:00.468
Whatever it takes to seek justice!

05:00.551 --> 05:01.594
Hey, you know what?

05:01.719 --> 05:02.720
- We've all...
- Laugh it up.

05:02.804 --> 05:05.598
- Why don't we all take six months off?
- Oh, come on, Sam!

05:06.140 --> 05:07.725
- I'm gonna go on strike...
- Good for you.

05:07.809 --> 05:09.811
...against people who go on strike.

05:09.894 --> 05:10.895
Sam, Sam...

05:11.062 --> 05:12.397
And I won't cross your picket line either.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.731
Oh, give me that, Trumbo! You're just...

05:13.815 --> 05:15.942
- Sam! Sam!
- You know what? You know what?

05:16.067 --> 05:17.777
I've spent a hell of a long time... What?

05:17.902 --> 05:18.861
You're not helping... Eddie...

05:18.945 --> 05:21.155
Sam, Sam. We gotta talk about
those scenes tomorrow.

05:21.239 --> 05:23.574
Disaster. Who the hell wrote that crap?

05:24.283 --> 05:25.410
But, uh, first...

05:25.493 --> 05:27.078
- Whoa, whoa!
- May I have this dance?

05:27.161 --> 05:28.871
Eddie... You're spilling my drink.

05:28.955 --> 05:30.164
Having fun?

05:32.750 --> 05:34.085
Eternally.

05:34.919 --> 05:36.087
Miss Hopper.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.174
Dateline, Hollywood.

05:40.258 --> 05:43.553
The offices of top columnist Hedda Hopper.

05:43.636 --> 05:48.266
Greetings from our film capital,
where all is sun and fun.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.602
Or is it? You see the famous faces here?

05:52.145 --> 05:55.982
Danny Kaye, Humphrey Bogart,
his dishy bride Lauren Bacall.

05:56.107 --> 06:01.070
All of whom have declared solidarity
with film crews picketing for higher wages

06:01.154 --> 06:03.489
in walkouts that quickly turned violent.

06:04.323 --> 06:09.120
Because these strikes were, in fact,
the work of dangerous radicals.

06:09.454 --> 06:13.791
Here, we see actor Edward G. Robinson,
star of Double Indemnity.

06:13.875 --> 06:17.253
And this is writer Dalton Trumbo,

06:17.336 --> 06:20.798
who is, like many of those
strikers and their supporters,

06:20.882 --> 06:23.051
a registered communist.

06:23.134 --> 06:25.553
Who exactly is behind these walkouts?

06:25.636 --> 06:27.346
You actually create something...

06:27.472 --> 06:29.557
- And why?
- ...and they reap all the profits.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.683
Now, is that fair?

06:30.808 --> 06:31.768
- No!
- No!

06:31.851 --> 06:33.478
Our elected leaders will find out.

06:34.687 --> 06:39.609
Congressman J. Parnell Thomas and his
House Un-American Activities Committee.

06:39.692 --> 06:43.529
Communism is not some faraway threat.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.490
Its most dangerous agents are here,

06:45.573 --> 06:48.034
controlling the airwaves
and movie screens.

06:48.159 --> 06:49.994
Taking over its employees
and their unions.

06:50.495 --> 06:54.957
They need to be identified
as the enemies they are.

06:55.041 --> 06:58.586
Communists, their goal: world domination.

06:58.669 --> 07:01.172
The frontline of a new kind of war.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.507
A cold war.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.009
A conspiracy to corrupt democratic values

07:05.093 --> 07:07.762
and bring about
the overthrow of this nation.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.433
Mitzi fell asleep.

07:12.517 --> 07:15.812
Hey! That you in the news reel?

07:15.895 --> 07:17.063
Yes, it was.

07:19.941 --> 07:21.109
Traitor.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.403
Oh, my God! Honey.

07:24.529 --> 07:26.030
No, I'm all right,
I'm all right. No harm done.

07:26.114 --> 07:27.240
Are you sure? Oh.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.700
Come on. Let's go.

07:33.079 --> 07:34.205
- Dad?
- Mmm.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.583
Are you a communist?

07:37.708 --> 07:38.918
I am.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.422
Is that against the law?

07:43.548 --> 07:44.966
It is not.

07:47.718 --> 07:52.473
The lady with the big hat said
you were a dangerous radical.

07:53.558 --> 07:54.559
Are you?

07:55.893 --> 07:58.437
Radical? Maybe.

07:59.730 --> 08:03.985
Dangerous. Only to men who fling Cokes.

08:04.819 --> 08:06.529
I love our country.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.990
And it's a good government.

08:09.073 --> 08:12.952
But anything good could be better,
don't you think?

08:15.246 --> 08:16.914
Is Mom a communist?

08:17.832 --> 08:18.916
No.

08:20.585 --> 08:21.752
Am I?

08:23.379 --> 08:27.383
Well, why don't we give you
the official test?

08:27.466 --> 08:29.093
Mom makes your favorite lunch.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.595
Ham and cheese.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.096
Ham and cheese.

08:32.221 --> 08:35.850
And at school, you see someone
with no lunch at all.

08:35.933 --> 08:36.933
What do you do?

08:37.768 --> 08:38.852
Share.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.062
Share?

08:40.145 --> 08:42.565
Well, you don't tell them
to just go get a job?

08:42.648 --> 08:43.774
No.

08:44.609 --> 08:47.445
Oh. You offer them a loan at 6%.
Oh, that's very clever.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.613
Dad.

08:49.113 --> 08:51.824
Ah, then you just ignore them.

08:51.949 --> 08:52.950
No.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.204
Well, well.

08:56.287 --> 08:57.747
You little commie.

08:59.916 --> 09:02.877
Trumbo, as usual,
you only make sense to you.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.172
Now, let them call you
a communist, me a Democrat.

09:06.297 --> 09:07.757
They're both legitimate parties.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.552
Yours is just meaner and duller, but
there's nothing illegal about any of it.

09:11.636 --> 09:12.970
- Yet...
- Hunter.

09:13.512 --> 09:16.390
Tell your friend to dial down
the paranoia and have a drink.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.434
I don't think he's being paranoid enough.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.478
Not you too.

09:20.603 --> 09:21.896
You're out of ice.

09:21.979 --> 09:26.192
Now, I have taken the liberty
of drawing up a pamphlet.

09:26.317 --> 09:30.279
The subject: Congress unaware
of a little thing

09:30.363 --> 09:32.198
called the First Amendment.

09:32.323 --> 09:35.326
They're aware of it.
They just don't give a shit.

09:35.451 --> 09:37.828
All they care about is this
nice new war of theirs.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.373
These guys love war
and this is a great one,

09:40.498 --> 09:43.876
'cause it's vague and it's scary
and it's expensive.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.546
Anybody for it is a hero
and anybody against it is a traitor.

09:47.672 --> 09:48.756
Exactly, thank you.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.383
Arlen, not near the paintings.

09:50.508 --> 09:54.637
And if you think this is about
the movies, you're an idiot.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.266
Which is why I'm going to have
a little chat with the other side.

09:58.349 --> 10:00.017
You don't mean the Alliance, do you?

10:00.142 --> 10:01.102
I do.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.853
Are you out of your mind?

10:02.979 --> 10:06.482
Eddie, they're all actors
and writers and directors, just like us.

10:06.565 --> 10:09.527
They're Nazis. They're just too cheap
to buy the uniforms.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.070
They invited Congress out here.

10:11.195 --> 10:14.490
And are they all Sam Woods
and Hedda Hoppers?

10:15.366 --> 10:18.953
Please, let's not demonize
people we don't really know.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.037
I say we go for it.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.957
And you know who you're gonna
be talking to there, don't you?

10:23.040 --> 10:25.876
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. John Wayne.

10:33.217 --> 10:36.137
I wanna say one thing
about a place I love.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.264
No, not Hollywood.

10:38.889 --> 10:43.060
I like Hollywood, but I love America.

10:45.730 --> 10:50.067
And when we talk about America,
I'm talking about freedom.

10:50.192 --> 10:53.821
The kind of freedom we just
fought a world war to save.

10:55.364 --> 10:58.242
You want to be a communist?
Go be a communist.

10:58.367 --> 11:03.122
But some friends of mine in Washington
think you got some questions to answer.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.790
I never knew he was this good.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.417
You still want to be a commie...

11:06.542 --> 11:08.669
- 'Cause he's not acting. That's him.
- ...go be one in Russia.

11:08.753 --> 11:12.631
But off you go and enjoy
the Bolshoi Ballet.

11:16.594 --> 11:19.180
Excuse me, sir, would you like to
read about the First Amendment?

11:19.263 --> 11:21.140
- Sir, a little education.
- You know your rights?

11:21.265 --> 11:22.892
Pamphlet on the First Amendment.

11:22.975 --> 11:25.269
- A little light reading.
- Travels well.

11:27.146 --> 11:28.147
Well, thank you, Sam.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.193
Do svidanya.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.277
It costs money to print those.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.488
How'd you like to learn
about the First Amendment?

11:35.613 --> 11:36.572
This is a nightmare.

11:36.655 --> 11:37.740
Dalton.

11:38.449 --> 11:40.910
Oh, Hedda. Good evening to you.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.828
Eddie, darling!

11:42.953 --> 11:44.121
Hedda.

11:45.331 --> 11:46.582
New hat.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.958
Ah, daily, darling, daily.

11:49.627 --> 11:51.796
Been to the movies lately, Dalton?

11:52.630 --> 11:55.841
Duke. Now, wasn't he magnificent?

11:55.966 --> 11:58.511
Just saying what needs saying. Hi, Eddie.

11:59.345 --> 12:00.471
Duke.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.139
I hear you and your pals got a pamphlet.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.308
- Any takers?
- Not yet.

12:05.476 --> 12:07.478
Uh, would you like one, sir?
We're communists.

12:09.105 --> 12:11.023
He's a writer.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.401
You won't get any takers.
Not here, anyway.

12:13.484 --> 12:14.819
Oh, why is that?

12:14.944 --> 12:19.073
All it says is that Congress
has no right to investigate

12:19.156 --> 12:21.992
how we vote or where we pray,

12:22.118 --> 12:25.162
what we think, say or how we make movies.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.915
Hello, I'm Dalton Trumbo.

12:27.998 --> 12:32.086
Congress has the right to go after
anything they think is a threat.

12:32.169 --> 12:36.173
Well, that's where we disagree
and that's the point.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.801
We both have the right to be wrong.

12:39.468 --> 12:43.013
You wanna talk about rights,
first tell me whose side you're on.

12:43.139 --> 12:44.765
Russia's no friend, not anymore.

12:44.849 --> 12:45.891
You'd better wake up.

12:46.016 --> 12:49.562
'Cause it's a new day. A new day!

12:50.062 --> 12:51.063
And?

12:52.523 --> 12:54.191
And maybe it's not for your kind.

12:54.316 --> 12:57.570
My kind? What kind is that?

12:57.695 --> 13:01.031
The kind that has no idea
why we just won a war.

13:01.866 --> 13:05.202
It's curious, that's the second time
you mentioned that.

13:05.327 --> 13:08.414
See, I was a war correspondent in Okinawa.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.542
Hedda's son was stationed
in the Philippines.

13:11.667 --> 13:15.045
Eddie was in Europe with
the Office of War Information.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.047
Where did you serve again?

13:18.424 --> 13:19.508
You trying to say something?

13:19.592 --> 13:21.343
No, Duke, he wasn't.

13:21.427 --> 13:22.678
Stay out of it, Eddie.

13:22.761 --> 13:27.016
If you're going to talk about World War II
as if you personally won it,

13:27.099 --> 13:30.144
let's be clear where you were stationed.

13:30.227 --> 13:34.440
On a film set, shooting blanks,
wearing makeup.

13:35.399 --> 13:38.444
And if you're going to hit me,
I would like to take off my glasses.

13:40.738 --> 13:42.698
Duke, come on. Let's get out of here.

13:43.699 --> 13:47.536
Thank you, Dalton. My next
column just wrote itself.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.330
It's a good thing you didn't
want to demonize anybody

13:49.413 --> 13:51.248
or else that could have been awkward.

13:53.042 --> 13:54.502
Manny wouldn't say "amorous."

13:54.585 --> 13:55.628
Hang on one second.

13:55.753 --> 13:58.547
Paul, two packs, please.

13:58.631 --> 14:00.966
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.218
Here you go.

14:08.807 --> 14:12.603
Good God, she's everywhere.

14:12.728 --> 14:17.149
Your next deal's gonna make you
the highest-paid writer in Hollywood.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.818
Which will make you
the highest-paid writer in the world.

14:20.611 --> 14:21.654
You earned it.

14:21.779 --> 14:24.907
You don't just write happy endings,
you actually believe them.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.159
That's what people pay to see.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.578
That's why you belong here
at MGM. Right, L.B.?

14:29.662 --> 14:33.791
I hate to make the wooing too easy
for you, but where do I sign?

14:38.629 --> 14:39.588
Just one thing.

14:39.672 --> 14:41.590
If you're gonna work for me,

14:41.674 --> 14:45.928
I never, ever want to see
anything like this again.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.933
You won't. I promise.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.017
Good.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.353
Just stop reading Hedda Hopper.

15:00.985 --> 15:02.361
So, what did L.B. say then?

15:02.486 --> 15:04.321
Jesus, don't.

15:04.446 --> 15:07.116
I haven't eaten since.
My job's not hard enough?

15:07.199 --> 15:09.577
Your job is not hard at all.

15:09.660 --> 15:13.539
You think getting Mayer to sign you
after those headlines was easy?

15:13.664 --> 15:18.502
You have a record-breaking
three-year contract to make shit up.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.170
You're welcome.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.802
Oh, honey, not now.

15:26.885 --> 15:27.928
Please, Mom?

15:28.012 --> 15:29.638
She really can.

15:29.722 --> 15:30.889
- Ask her!
- Can what?

15:31.015 --> 15:32.600
Cleo, is this true?

15:32.683 --> 15:34.059
Watch this.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.104
- Trumbo...
- Come on.

15:40.232 --> 15:41.567
Of course, you realize this means war.

15:41.692 --> 15:42.693
Behold!

15:43.360 --> 15:44.862
I had a very unusual mother.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.864
Translation: stage mother.

15:49.366 --> 15:52.703
The misspent youth of a child acrobat.

15:53.579 --> 15:55.831
My God, how long were you
in show business?

15:55.914 --> 15:58.375
Till I was 15, but it was more
show forced-labor.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.172
- Bravo!
- Brilliant!

16:13.432 --> 16:14.516
Mr. Dalton Trumbo?

16:15.559 --> 16:16.560
Yes?

16:19.438 --> 16:20.439
I'll see you in Washington.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.697
Enjoy your picnic.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.658
Let's go, boys.

16:30.741 --> 16:31.742
Yes, Mr. Stripling, sir.

16:34.453 --> 16:38.374
Nineteen subpoenas have
been issued to those we believe

16:38.457 --> 16:42.044
have knowledge of the ongoing
communist threat in Hollywood.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.504
What kind of threat is that?

16:43.587 --> 16:46.465
A conspiracy to corrupt democratic values

16:46.590 --> 16:48.467
and bring about
the overthrow of this nation.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.761
Using movies?

16:50.886 --> 16:52.471
Any movie in particular or...

16:52.596 --> 16:55.391
Movies are the most powerful
influence ever created.

16:55.808 --> 16:59.311
And they are infested
with hidden traitors.

17:00.270 --> 17:04.191
The House Un-American Activities
Committee has been formed to investigate

17:04.273 --> 17:07.069
alleged communists working in Hollywood.

17:07.152 --> 17:10.446
The newsreel cameras and an army
of newspapermen are on hand.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.701
Mr. Reagan, has it been reported to you

17:13.784 --> 17:16.704
that certain members of the Screen
Actors Guild are communists?

17:16.787 --> 17:20.165
There has been a small group
more or less following the tactics

17:20.249 --> 17:24.044
that we, uh, associate
with the Communist Party.

17:24.127 --> 17:27.673
And would you refer to them
as a disrupting influence?

17:28.214 --> 17:31.719
I would say that, at times, they have
attempted to be a disruptive influence.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.012
Do you believe that
the motion picture industry

17:34.096 --> 17:36.056
is doing everything it can to rid itself

17:36.140 --> 17:38.600
of subversive un-American influences?

17:38.809 --> 17:40.936
No. The communists are everywhere.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.480
They report directly to Moscow.

17:43.814 --> 17:47.818
On numerous occasions,
communist agitators have tried hard

17:48.068 --> 17:49.486
to steer us into the red river.

17:50.696 --> 17:52.698
We had a little too much weight for that.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.659
Will you name a few of these agitators?

17:57.161 --> 18:00.289
Well, Irving Pichel,

18:00.372 --> 18:03.208
Edward Dmytryk, Frank Tuttle.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.879
If I had my way about it,
they'd all be sent back to Russia

18:07.004 --> 18:09.465
or some other unpleasant place.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.510
We get our chance
to testify in three days.

18:13.594 --> 18:17.181
And what we're about to do
won't make us too popular.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.558
Okay, so we get slandered and then what?

18:19.683 --> 18:23.437
You answer every question
they ask in your own way.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.731
So, don't tell them shit.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.191
Beautifully put.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.484
Well, you know what they call that?

18:28.567 --> 18:29.693
Yes.

18:31.028 --> 18:34.406
In all likelihood, we'll be cited
for contempt of Congress.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.533
There will be a trial.

18:36.617 --> 18:38.118
What am I missing here?

18:38.202 --> 18:39.620
All I'm hearing is jail.

18:39.703 --> 18:40.788
Not necessarily.

18:40.871 --> 18:45.125
In a lower court, yes,
we'll most likely lose.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.127
- But on appeal...
- It'll work.

18:47.211 --> 18:50.297
The Supreme Court is
a five-to-four liberal majority.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.216
They think this committee
is unconstitutional.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.383
They want it killed.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.469
Sounds great.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.387
I'm out.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.641
Niki.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.856
Look, I can't afford this stuff
you guys are talking about.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.650
The Supreme Court and legal fees...

19:10.234 --> 19:12.277
You know, Dorothy's not gonna...

19:12.402 --> 19:14.696
I mean, things already
aren't great, but you know...

19:14.780 --> 19:18.659
If I dump all my savings into that,
she's gone with the kids.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.077
I'll cover you.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.289
Expenses, travel, legal fees, everything.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.668
You don't even like me.

19:28.919 --> 19:31.922
I like you fine. You don't like me.

19:38.637 --> 19:40.806
No, you know what it is?
I don't trust you.

19:40.931 --> 19:43.308
Well, I'd say go on,
but I'm afraid you will.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.227
Look, I know what I am. Okay?

19:45.310 --> 19:47.521
I want this whole country
to be different, top to bottom.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.691
If I get what I want,
nobody gets their own lake.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.818
Well, that would be a very
dull life, don't you think?

19:52.943 --> 19:53.902
Yeah, for you.

19:53.986 --> 19:55.612
Not for the guys who built this.

19:56.154 --> 20:00.576
If I'm wrong, tell me, but ever since
I've known you, you talk like a radical.

20:00.659 --> 20:02.661
But you live like a rich guy.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.205
That is true.

20:05.956 --> 20:06.915
Well, I don't know that you're...

20:06.999 --> 20:10.294
I don't think you're willing to lose
all of this just to do the right thing.

20:13.505 --> 20:17.092
Well, I despise martyrdom
and I won't fight for a lost cause.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.302
So you're right.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.637
I'm not willing to lose it all.
Certainly not them.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.850
But I am willing to risk it all.

20:24.975 --> 20:28.896
That's where the radical and the rich guy
make a perfect combination.

20:28.979 --> 20:32.733
The radical may fight with
the purity of Jesus.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.861
But the rich guy wins with
the cunning of Satan.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.780
Oh, shit.

20:38.906 --> 20:40.240
What?

20:40.324 --> 20:44.369
Just please shut up. Please.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.663
I'll do whatever you want.

20:46.747 --> 20:49.333
Just please don't say shit
like that anymore.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.423
I can't guarantee that.

20:57.215 --> 21:00.427
In Washington,
10 of the original 19 subpoenaed

21:00.510 --> 21:04.556
began their testimony before the House
Un-American Activities Committee.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.808
Mr. Trumbo, raise your right hand.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.061
Do you solemnly swear the testimony
you are about to give

21:09.186 --> 21:11.438
is the truth, the whole truth,
nothing but the truth so help you God?

21:12.022 --> 21:12.981
I do.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.441
Sit down, please.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.818
Mr. Trumbo, now I shall ask you

21:16.902 --> 21:21.198
a series of various questions all of which
can be answered with a yes or a no.

21:22.240 --> 21:26.370
Well, I shall answer yes or no
if I please to answer.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.122
I shall answer in my own words.

21:29.206 --> 21:34.169
Many questions can be answered yes
or no only by a moron or a slave.

21:34.252 --> 21:35.796
That's enough!

21:35.879 --> 21:37.547
Are you refusing to answer the question?

21:37.631 --> 21:40.759
Mr. Chairman, I will refuse to answer
none of your questions.

21:40.884 --> 21:44.888
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

21:44.972 --> 21:46.890
May I introduce to evidence...

21:46.974 --> 21:48.141
No. No! You are out of order!

21:48.225 --> 21:50.268
- ...my work, my screenplays...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:50.394 --> 21:52.729
...by which you are
making this determination?

21:52.813 --> 21:54.272
No, the chair will rule.

21:54.398 --> 21:56.066
- It's critical to...
- No, just a minute.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.651
Your screenplays are too long.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.569
I've heard that before.

21:59.653 --> 22:03.115
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

22:03.907 --> 22:06.284
Am I accused of a crime?

22:06.410 --> 22:07.536
You're not asking the questions.

22:07.619 --> 22:10.330
If so, I believe I have
the right to be confronted

22:10.414 --> 22:13.583
with any evidence
that supports this question.

22:13.667 --> 22:14.793
Are you refusing to answer the...

22:14.918 --> 22:16.420
I should very much like
to see what you have.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.214
Oh, you would? You will see very soon!

22:19.297 --> 22:20.590
Good!

22:20.674 --> 22:21.842
The witness is excused.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.344
You believe this committee has
the right to compel testimony.

22:24.428 --> 22:26.304
You are dismissed, sir!
Witness is dismissed!

22:26.430 --> 22:27.973
To indict opinion,
to criminalize thought...

22:28.098 --> 22:29.266
Guard, take him out!

22:29.349 --> 22:30.600
...but that right does not exist, sir!

22:30.684 --> 22:31.893
Order!

22:31.977 --> 22:34.021
And the moment it does, God help us all!

22:34.104 --> 22:35.647
This is typical communist tactic!

22:35.772 --> 22:38.316
This is the beginning of an
American concentration camp!

22:38.442 --> 22:39.651
Order!

22:40.027 --> 22:41.486
Uh, state your name, please.

22:41.611 --> 22:43.864
Arlen Hird. I'm a screenwriter.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.700
You understand, sir, that if you
don't answer my questions,

22:46.783 --> 22:48.577
I can hold you in contempt of Congress?

22:48.660 --> 22:50.370
I didn't refuse yet, did I?

22:50.454 --> 22:53.123
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

22:53.832 --> 22:57.044
Well, I'd like to answer you, Congressman,
but I need to consult with my physician.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.128
- Your physician?
- Yes.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.212
I don't understand.

22:59.296 --> 23:01.715
To find out if he can surgically
remove my conscience.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.468
This is a hostile witness.

23:04.551 --> 23:07.554
This is typical communist tactics.

23:15.479 --> 23:18.440
Arlen. Arlen, what is it?

23:21.985 --> 23:23.487
It's cancer.

23:23.862 --> 23:24.905
What?

23:26.865 --> 23:28.158
Jesus...

23:30.494 --> 23:31.828
How long have you known?

23:32.996 --> 23:35.040
- Three months.
- Months?

23:35.165 --> 23:36.374
Mmm-hmm.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.461
Are you receiving treatment?

23:39.544 --> 23:41.755
Uh, I don't like the options.

23:43.006 --> 23:45.050
It's lung cancer.

23:45.175 --> 23:46.927
Bad if you operate, bad if you don't.

23:49.679 --> 23:51.932
Well, is there anything I can do for you?

23:53.850 --> 23:56.728
No! No, it's cancer.

23:56.853 --> 23:57.854
Yeah, but...

23:57.938 --> 23:59.356
Jesus.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.943
You want to do something?
Make sure this plan works.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.445
I'm out of options.

24:23.797 --> 24:26.424
We were so young.
We thought we knew everything.

24:26.550 --> 24:28.051
We did.

24:28.135 --> 24:29.553
No, not me.

24:30.470 --> 24:33.056
No, I didn't realize how much
I loved it all

24:33.140 --> 24:37.060
until I reached a certain age,
and the roles started drying up.

24:37.144 --> 24:39.563
I remember thinking, "Now what do you do

24:39.646 --> 24:42.190
"when you love something
but it stops loving you back?"

24:42.274 --> 24:43.400
You fight.

24:43.483 --> 24:47.320
No, no, no. You love it more
until it surrenders.

24:48.738 --> 24:52.075
Hedda, you never left MGM or my heart.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.997
How's your boy?

24:57.122 --> 24:58.498
Fine. Fine.

24:58.582 --> 24:59.875
Still in the navy?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.251
Yes, he's First Lieutenant.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.753
You raised a real hero.

25:03.837 --> 25:05.422
Which is why I would like to tell him

25:05.505 --> 25:08.258
that we are doing as much
for this country as he is.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.552
It's complicated.

25:10.635 --> 25:13.597
Trumbo, the others, all have contracts.

25:14.848 --> 25:19.436
Oh, L.B., you helped build
this business as did I.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.897
We're not gonna watch
these pissants defile it.

25:21.980 --> 25:25.275
I'm running a studio here, Hedda.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.819
You think I love every person
on my payroll?

25:27.944 --> 25:29.529
Grow up.

25:30.864 --> 25:35.535
Then how about I make it crystal clear
to my 35 million readers

25:36.119 --> 25:40.290
exactly who runs Hollywood
and won't fire these traitors?

25:41.791 --> 25:45.462
How about I name names? Real names.

25:45.545 --> 25:51.259
Jacob Warner, Jack Warner.
Schmuel Gelbfisz, Sam Goldwyn.

25:51.343 --> 25:54.429
And of course, yours. Lazar Meir.

25:54.512 --> 25:55.972
You watch what you say to me!

25:56.056 --> 25:58.892
Forty years ago, you were
starving in some shtetl.

25:58.975 --> 26:02.562
The greatest country on Earth
takes you in, gives you wealth, power.

26:02.646 --> 26:05.565
But the second we need you,
you do nothing.

26:05.649 --> 26:08.151
And that's exactly what my readers expect

26:08.235 --> 26:10.695
from a business run by kikes.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.821
Get out!

26:15.158 --> 26:17.410
You know, L.B., I am fond of you.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.997
Some of my happiest years
were spent on this lot.

26:21.498 --> 26:23.500
Not in your office, of course.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.877
You were always trying
to fuck me on the couch.

26:26.002 --> 26:29.005
Me, trying to maintain my virtue...
Barely.

26:29.673 --> 26:30.924
But times change.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.510
Now I'd happily fuck you.

26:38.598 --> 26:42.811
All studios unanimously agree
to discharge the Hollywood Ten

26:42.894 --> 26:45.397
without compensation,
effective immediately.

26:45.522 --> 26:50.110
No studio will ever employ
a member of the Communist Party

26:50.193 --> 26:52.320
or anyone refusing to cooperate

26:52.404 --> 26:55.365
in our struggle
with this terrible new menace.

26:55.907 --> 27:00.370
He's been loved by film fans
for almost 20 years.

27:00.453 --> 27:04.291
But have you noticed he hasn't
been on-screen much lately?

27:04.374 --> 27:06.001
Bad box office?

27:06.084 --> 27:08.837
No. Bad politics.

27:08.920 --> 27:12.549
Bad news indeed
for Mr. Edward G. Robinson.

27:13.049 --> 27:14.384
Thank you so much for coming.

27:14.467 --> 27:18.471
The Hollywood Ten are going
to court for all of us.

27:19.264 --> 27:21.224
It'll be long, expensive,

27:21.308 --> 27:24.978
so please give as much as you
can to the defense fund.

27:25.061 --> 27:27.063
Thank you for coming.

27:28.732 --> 27:30.650
- Good night, my dear.
- Good luck.

27:30.734 --> 27:31.901
- Good night, sir. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

27:33.069 --> 27:35.697
Well, this little gathering
didn't quite have

27:35.780 --> 27:38.283
the zip and zing of yesteryear, did it?

27:38.408 --> 27:40.452
Where are all the liberals
all of a sudden?

27:40.577 --> 27:42.829
At their lawyers' or psychiatrists'.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.331
Hmm, likely both.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.000
For the defense fund.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.251
Eddie...

27:49.169 --> 27:50.545
Have you been working?

27:50.628 --> 27:52.922
Eh. It's a bit slow.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.135
You sold one.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.138
Oh, the van Gogh.

28:01.598 --> 28:03.433
Got a good price.

28:03.516 --> 28:04.809
Eddie...

28:06.269 --> 28:09.064
Dear God, look at this.
Eddie, I can't let you do...

28:09.147 --> 28:10.482
I'll be fine, kid, take it.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.276
No, it's too much. It's just too much.

28:15.987 --> 28:17.280
Take it.

28:19.199 --> 28:21.201
Eddie, I...

28:21.284 --> 28:23.995
Everything that you have...

28:25.205 --> 28:28.416
What he's trying to say
is that he loves you.

28:28.500 --> 28:32.962
I love him too, the warty son of a bitch.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.801
Got a great offer on the Monet
if you want to bribe the jury.

28:40.136 --> 28:43.681
In the matter of the United States
v. Dalton Trumbo,

28:44.474 --> 28:48.478
we find the defendant guilty
of contempt of Congress.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.899
Mr. Trumbo! Mr. Trumbo!

28:54.234 --> 28:56.277
I'll meet you in the car.

28:56.361 --> 28:58.321
Mr. Trumbo, are you
in contempt of Congress?

28:58.405 --> 29:00.824
Well, I have total contempt
of this Congress.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.368
I just thought the jury would see why.

29:03.493 --> 29:07.622
The Supreme Court will drop kick
this verdict into speeding traffic

29:07.705 --> 29:10.708
and end the most shameful chapter
in Congressional history.

29:10.834 --> 29:12.794
Now, that's it, boys.
We have nothing else.

29:12.877 --> 29:14.045
No, we're done, we're done.

29:14.546 --> 29:16.131
How are you doing for money?

29:16.214 --> 29:18.758
Broke as a bankrupt's bastard. Why?

29:18.842 --> 29:22.762
Well, you owe me $30,000,
and this appeal's gonna be twice that.

29:22.846 --> 29:24.305
Well, I'd better get to work.

29:24.389 --> 29:27.934
Doing what? You have no talent
to do anything else.

29:28.852 --> 29:30.728
Hollywood fights back!

29:32.021 --> 29:33.523
This is Gregory Peck.

29:33.606 --> 29:35.233
A state of near hysteria

29:35.358 --> 29:38.820
over so-called communists in this country
threatens the freedom of other citizens.

29:40.071 --> 29:42.782
So the Un-American Committee
bears its tragic fruit.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.368
This is Lucille Ball.

29:45.743 --> 29:50.290
All of us agree that the Constitution
of the United States must be defended.

29:50.373 --> 29:54.961
But the way to do this is not by
shutting up the man you disagree with.

29:55.044 --> 29:58.173
You must fight for his right
to speak and be heard.

29:58.256 --> 30:00.884
All civil liberties go hand in hand.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.011
And when one goes,
the others are weakened.

30:03.094 --> 30:05.013
Just as a collapse
of one pillar in a house

30:05.096 --> 30:07.056
would endanger the whole structure.

30:18.401 --> 30:20.403
We'll send you home in a couple of days.

30:22.238 --> 30:25.200
Well, it sounds like you're going to live.

30:25.283 --> 30:28.119
Yeah, they got me just
well enough to go to prison.

30:30.622 --> 30:31.748
How do you feel?

30:32.582 --> 30:36.252
Breathing with one lung,
which is half as good as two.

30:37.253 --> 30:41.633
Look, Arlen, I heard about Dorothy.

30:41.758 --> 30:43.885
Yeah, she took off.

30:43.968 --> 30:47.096
Her timing was always amazing.

30:48.598 --> 30:50.058
I'm sorry.

30:50.141 --> 30:53.269
No, well, I know. I mean,
how could you leave all this?

30:56.856 --> 30:58.650
How's it going out there?

31:00.026 --> 31:01.861
Everyone envies you.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.741
Well, why wouldn't they?

31:06.824 --> 31:08.785
I got the best room in the joint.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.955
You should know. You paid for it.

31:13.873 --> 31:16.084
- Congratulations, Buddy.
- Thank you, fellas.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.586
Who needs the studios?
I am strictly independent.

31:18.670 --> 31:21.464
Got cans of film,
wads of Wall Street dough,

31:21.548 --> 31:24.259
and my favorite boss, me.

31:24.342 --> 31:25.843
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:29.722 --> 31:31.307
And you, you crazy son of a bitch,

31:31.391 --> 31:34.811
you're gonna write all of my movies
once this Washington crap clears up.

31:35.979 --> 31:37.480
And how will that happen?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.023
I'm not political, thank Jesus.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.943
If they called me in,
accused me, I'd just say,

31:42.026 --> 31:43.987
"Yup, did it. Sorry, didn't mean it."

31:44.821 --> 31:46.656
So Congress then asks,

31:46.739 --> 31:49.659
"Are you now or have you ever
been a Democrat?"

31:51.077 --> 31:55.832
I am and, God, I just feel awful about it.

31:57.083 --> 32:00.670
Then they want the names
of other Democrats.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.256
Bill and Earl, Nate, Tom.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.094
Then I say, "Go to hell."

32:08.678 --> 32:10.346
Really?

32:10.430 --> 32:13.308
How many banks fund enemies of the state?

32:14.684 --> 32:18.354
Your money's gone unless you give
the names of your friends here.

32:18.438 --> 32:22.358
They'll never work again,
but it's the only way you ever will.

32:27.655 --> 32:30.450
We all know each other, our families.

32:31.826 --> 32:32.869
We're friends.

32:35.163 --> 32:37.290
What would you do, Buddy?

32:41.836 --> 32:43.713
Only you.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.965
Piss on the best day of a guy's life.

32:46.049 --> 32:48.217
Only you!

32:54.682 --> 32:56.559
Christ's sakes.

32:57.727 --> 33:00.146
According to the protocol set forth...

33:05.735 --> 33:07.737
And what does she say?

33:09.739 --> 33:11.741
What does the princess say?

33:19.248 --> 33:22.085
Shit... Shit!

33:25.880 --> 33:28.174
Shouldn't be any likeness...

33:28.383 --> 33:30.718
It concerns me a little bit.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.764
Oh, good morning, Nikola.

33:35.098 --> 33:37.558
I thought you weren't allowed
to write anymore.

33:38.267 --> 33:43.690
Ah. No. No, just not allowed
to put my name on it,

33:43.940 --> 33:45.608
or get paid.

33:45.775 --> 33:47.193
How does that work?

33:50.238 --> 33:51.739
Not very well.

33:52.949 --> 33:56.786
It's funny. It's breezy and romantic.

33:57.286 --> 33:58.371
Who wrote it?

33:58.454 --> 34:01.582
You did, old boy.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.793
You stick your name on my labor,

34:03.960 --> 34:06.629
hand it in to your studio
and we're in business.

34:06.796 --> 34:10.925
Look, it is just dumb luck that I wasn't
subpoenaed and blacklisted myself.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.635
The hearings are going
to start up again soon.

34:12.802 --> 34:14.762
I'm going to get called and canned.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.222
Well, then quick, lad.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.559
Let's sell this little beauty
and split the take, 50-50.

34:19.891 --> 34:23.312
Ridiculous. I'll take 10%.

34:23.646 --> 34:27.650
You'll take 20. No, 30!
And that's my final offer.

34:27.942 --> 34:29.485
You're the worst businessman ever.

34:29.569 --> 34:30.570
Mmm.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.280
I hate the title.

34:32.405 --> 34:33.822
Me too.

34:34.907 --> 34:36.117
Really? What's wrong with it?

34:36.159 --> 34:37.952
- The Princess and the Peasant.
- Yes.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.496
God, please, Trumbo,
it sounds like a puppet show.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.623
Well, then, change it.

34:42.748 --> 34:43.833
I did.

34:47.754 --> 34:50.005
Really? You think this title's better?

34:50.089 --> 34:52.091
Roman Holiday.

34:52.467 --> 34:53.842
I like it.

34:54.302 --> 34:55.553
Who invited you?

34:55.678 --> 34:57.013
I did.

34:57.513 --> 34:59.515
She's my favorite Trumbo.

35:00.183 --> 35:04.520
I'm introducing legislation so in
the event of a national emergency,

35:05.104 --> 35:08.024
all communists will be sent
to internment camps.

35:08.191 --> 35:09.859
And the president supports this?

35:09.942 --> 35:11.110
He better.

35:11.277 --> 35:15.031
Parnell, I need to speak to you privately
about your employees.

35:15.990 --> 35:16.991
Excuse me, gentlemen.

35:18.201 --> 35:21.871
As I said, Bob, these are legitimate
salaried employees from my home state.

35:22.038 --> 35:24.540
What you didn't tell me is
that every one of them is a relative.

35:24.707 --> 35:25.792
Which is completely legal.

35:25.875 --> 35:28.377
Except that none of them pay taxes.

35:28.711 --> 35:30.880
Don't say anything else without a lawyer.

35:40.223 --> 35:41.849
- No.
- Mrs. Trumbo.

35:42.475 --> 35:43.893
Mrs. Trumbo! Hi.

35:44.060 --> 35:45.478
Jeff.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.481
Ma'am, I gotta get paid.

35:48.731 --> 35:50.608
Oh. I'm so sorry.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.693
I got men with families.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.404
My husband hasn't been able
to get any work.

35:55.530 --> 35:57.073
We owe everyone.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.075
- Ma'am, please.
- I'm so...

35:59.242 --> 36:03.579
Cleo, we're rich!

36:04.747 --> 36:06.541
There you are, Jeffrey.

36:07.124 --> 36:09.877
You people sure live exciting lives.

36:10.753 --> 36:12.922
Well, I thank you. Appreciate it.

36:13.047 --> 36:14.423
Thank you, Betty!

36:14.590 --> 36:16.259
We did it, Cleo!

36:16.384 --> 36:19.053
We sold Roman Holiday! Paramount.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.597
Our beloved Ian is just...

36:21.931 --> 36:22.932
Why, what's the matter?

36:23.057 --> 36:24.058
Judge Rutledge died.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.310
No, no, that was Judge Murphy
who died last month.

36:26.435 --> 36:27.478
And Rutledge.

36:27.770 --> 36:29.272
Last night.

36:36.821 --> 36:38.114
Mmm.

36:38.573 --> 36:40.783
Oh, now...

36:42.118 --> 36:46.247
Everything will be all right. You'll see.

36:47.415 --> 36:49.709
Without a liberal majority on the court,

36:49.792 --> 36:52.420
our appeal's gonna be denied.

36:53.629 --> 36:57.633
Meaning we should all be
prepared to go to prison.

37:06.517 --> 37:10.813
I wouldn't change anything going back.
Not one thing.

37:13.691 --> 37:15.985
Let's ask each other in a year.

37:27.121 --> 37:28.372
Will you do me a favor?

37:28.706 --> 37:30.958
Hold on to this while I'm gone.

37:32.627 --> 37:34.045
Thank you, dear.

37:36.380 --> 37:39.383
Your mother needs to laugh
at least once a day.

37:39.675 --> 37:40.801
Deal?

37:40.927 --> 37:42.011
Okay.

37:43.220 --> 37:46.223
Where's that little pumpkin seed?

37:56.525 --> 37:57.860
- To the Hollywood Ten!
- Thank you.

38:04.367 --> 38:05.910
To the Hollywood Ten!

38:07.036 --> 38:08.537
You're heroes!

38:43.030 --> 38:46.075
28 cents. Gold lighter.

38:46.909 --> 38:50.454
Wallet. Cigarette case.

38:55.042 --> 38:56.085
Raise your hands.

38:57.628 --> 39:00.423
Open your mouth. Wider.

39:01.048 --> 39:04.593
Turn your head to the right. To the left.

39:05.469 --> 39:06.971
Tilt your head back.

39:08.431 --> 39:10.099
Spread your legs.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.603
Grab your sack and skin it back.

39:16.731 --> 39:18.107
Turn around.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.736
Spread your cheeks.

39:23.946 --> 39:27.241
Squat. Cough.

39:30.619 --> 39:32.121
Turn around.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.125
Move out.

39:37.501 --> 39:38.794
Next!

39:47.344 --> 39:49.638
So the warden says I gotta do right.

39:49.805 --> 39:51.474
Boy want a better job?

39:51.640 --> 39:53.976
I put him in charge of
the whole goddamn supply room.

39:54.143 --> 39:55.686
'Cause I know something the warden don't.

40:04.987 --> 40:08.657
Truck's unloaded.
Driver needs a signature.

40:20.336 --> 40:24.173
Actually, uh, he needs it right here.

40:34.725 --> 40:39.230
You know, if, uh... If you need any help,

40:39.396 --> 40:42.900
I used to run shipping at a...
At a bakery.

40:43.901 --> 40:45.319
Heard you's a writer.

40:45.444 --> 40:46.862
Well, that too.

40:47.029 --> 40:48.531
And a commie.

40:49.824 --> 40:52.201
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

40:52.576 --> 40:53.869
This is a great country.

40:53.994 --> 40:55.246
Agreed.

40:57.039 --> 40:58.374
You type?

41:05.214 --> 41:06.423
Stop.

41:10.344 --> 41:13.180
Well, now, if only I could read it.

41:19.687 --> 41:23.065
"Protocol as to return of goods.

41:23.732 --> 41:27.236
"There shall be triplicate
copies of Form 14-A filed

41:27.403 --> 41:30.573
"with Supply, Shipping
and Office of the Warden."

41:32.616 --> 41:34.618
You think you're gonna
teach me the alphabet

41:34.785 --> 41:37.079
and I'm gonna shake your hand
all grateful and say,

41:37.246 --> 41:40.207
"Thank you, Mr. Trumbo.
You done change my life, sir.

41:40.291 --> 41:42.042
"I'll never forget you."

41:46.422 --> 41:51.051
I got 20 years for killing me
a white man who tried to rob my bar.

41:51.302 --> 41:54.096
I did it and I'd do it again.

41:54.930 --> 41:59.268
You look down on me and I will fuck you
up like you've never been fucked up

41:59.393 --> 42:02.730
in your whole bullshit Beverly Hills life.

42:03.272 --> 42:06.442
Now I'm here trying to build
my time and make parole.

42:06.734 --> 42:08.611
You wanna help make that happen?

42:13.824 --> 42:17.494
Welcome to fucking Supply, Comrade.

42:24.335 --> 42:28.464
Dear Cleo, I don't
count the days or hours...

42:29.131 --> 42:30.966
I count the seconds.

42:31.300 --> 42:36.597
Sometimes I think I'll die
of boredom. Other times, fear.

42:37.181 --> 42:38.807
Not of this place.

42:38.933 --> 42:42.186
So far, its challenges
are all surmountable.

42:42.436 --> 42:45.147
Augmented by days of lovely boredom.

42:45.314 --> 42:49.026
So flat and calm in the wake
of all that churning

42:49.193 --> 42:51.487
ugly luckless battle.

42:52.655 --> 42:56.992
No, my fear is for what
will happen when I get out.

42:57.451 --> 43:00.120
To our family and our country.

43:01.830 --> 43:04.333
Not all the news is worrisome.

43:04.833 --> 43:09.004
Some reminds me that what the
imagination can't conjure

43:09.546 --> 43:12.007
reality delivers with a shrug.

43:12.216 --> 43:16.845
And reality has delivered
in all its beatific wonder

43:17.012 --> 43:21.350
to the federal penal system,
J. Parnell Thomas,

43:21.850 --> 43:24.353
convicted of tax evasion.

43:25.020 --> 43:28.649
Well, look at us.
Just a couple of jailbirds.

43:29.692 --> 43:32.653
Except you actually committed a crime.

43:37.658 --> 43:40.202
Yet in all this,

43:40.661 --> 43:45.666
I know I'm the luckiest
unlucky man ever to live,

43:46.208 --> 43:49.878
because you and the children warm, feed,

43:50.045 --> 43:53.424
clothe, pacify, and rejuvenate me

43:54.008 --> 43:56.218
by never leaving my heart.

43:57.052 --> 44:01.432
Love, Prisoner Number 7551.

44:07.021 --> 44:10.733
We're not gonna take that hill
from the Japs with bullets,

44:10.899 --> 44:12.776
bombs or fists.

44:12.901 --> 44:13.861
Yeah!

44:13.944 --> 44:15.112
We're gonna take it with blood.

44:15.529 --> 44:18.240
Whoever spills more, loses.

44:18.782 --> 44:20.868
And we don't lose.

44:21.201 --> 44:22.328
Do we?

44:22.453 --> 44:23.579
No!

44:30.919 --> 44:32.087
You lose.

44:32.254 --> 44:33.922
That's what I thought.

44:39.053 --> 44:40.888
You know John Wayne?

44:41.013 --> 44:42.806
I do.

44:44.892 --> 44:47.102
What's he like?

44:47.227 --> 44:49.396
You'd love each other.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.610
Isn't he beautiful? Okay.

44:56.612 --> 44:58.238
- Mom, I got a new one.
- Huh?

45:00.949 --> 45:02.451
Okay, wait.

45:03.494 --> 45:05.746
Come on, you're gonna scare the horse.

45:05.954 --> 45:08.457
Mom, you'd better come quick!

45:08.957 --> 45:11.835
Edward Robinson,
are you now or have you ever been

45:11.919 --> 45:13.462
a member of the Communist Party?

45:13.629 --> 45:17.800
I'm not now, sir, nor have I
ever been a member of that party.

45:17.966 --> 45:20.928
I have always been a Liberal Democrat.

45:21.095 --> 45:22.763
But in your home over the years,

45:22.930 --> 45:25.182
there have been political
meetings attended by those

45:25.265 --> 45:26.642
that we now know to be communists.

45:26.809 --> 45:30.771
Yes, sir. Yes, that has now
been made clear to me.

45:31.188 --> 45:34.024
There were tremendous activities

45:34.149 --> 45:35.484
- and fundraisers...
- Shit.

45:35.609 --> 45:37.778
...that went on in my house
during the war.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.697
I did not know then

45:40.823 --> 45:44.034
all of their true affiliations

45:44.159 --> 45:46.286
or the work that they were up to.

45:46.870 --> 45:50.374
It never entered my mind that any
of these people were communists.

45:51.166 --> 45:55.963
I was duped and used. I was lied to.

45:56.130 --> 45:57.589
But who used you?

45:57.714 --> 45:59.174
Well, um...

45:59.675 --> 46:01.051
These sinister forces

46:01.176 --> 46:04.388
who probably ran these organizations.

46:04.555 --> 46:07.516
Oh, tell us the individuals
that you have reference to.

46:15.190 --> 46:16.358
Mr. Robinson?

46:19.820 --> 46:22.698
Well, uh, you had Albert Maltz.

46:24.241 --> 46:25.576
Um...

46:26.368 --> 46:30.706
I knew Frank Tuttle and that other fellow.

46:30.873 --> 46:32.624
That top fellow

46:32.708 --> 46:36.044
who they say is the, uh,
commissar out there. Um...

46:36.378 --> 46:37.713
Arlen Hird?

46:37.880 --> 46:39.214
Yes, yes, Arlen Hird.

46:40.007 --> 46:41.633
I didn't know Dmytryk at all.

46:41.758 --> 46:43.385
I'm a commissar now.

46:43.552 --> 46:47.556
Ian McLellan Hunter...

46:49.349 --> 46:53.020
...and, uh, Dalton Trumbo.

46:55.063 --> 46:56.482
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.

46:56.565 --> 46:58.066
Thank you, sir.

46:58.233 --> 47:00.736
Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions.

47:01.570 --> 47:03.697
Snitch like that in here,

47:04.531 --> 47:07.075
you end up fucking dead.

47:17.794 --> 47:20.047
Eddie ought to go back to work.
He did what he had to.

47:20.214 --> 47:22.925
No, no, he did what he was forced to do.

47:23.258 --> 47:25.469
Well, the point is, he did it.

47:26.762 --> 47:30.098
Brave men and boys are fighting
this battle against communism.

47:30.265 --> 47:33.560
They are sacrificing in ways
we can't even imagine.

47:33.936 --> 47:36.438
And you wanna talk about some
asshole's movie career?

47:36.939 --> 47:39.566
I'd see Eddie Robinson
and everyone like him dead

47:39.650 --> 47:42.986
if it'd bring back one boy
from Korea. Just one.

47:43.320 --> 47:44.780
So what are you saying?

47:44.905 --> 47:47.115
Guys like Eddie cooperate and get nothing?

47:47.783 --> 47:49.284
That isn't right.

47:49.409 --> 47:50.827
Careful, Duke.

47:51.119 --> 47:52.496
Or what, Hedda?

47:54.414 --> 47:58.001
If I'm not careful, what?

47:58.585 --> 48:01.421
I had no idea you were such a softie.

48:01.755 --> 48:05.467
That's me all right. All cuddles.

48:13.267 --> 48:14.935
Proud of ya, Eddie.

48:15.018 --> 48:17.646
Wasn't easy, I know. But you did good.

48:18.605 --> 48:19.940
Thanks, Duke.

48:20.315 --> 48:23.527
I'm gonna call the studios.
The offers will pour in.

48:29.366 --> 48:30.826
Sure.

48:34.663 --> 48:35.831
Thanks.

48:46.466 --> 48:49.344
One of the greatest peacetime
spy dramas in the nation's history

48:49.469 --> 48:53.807
reaches its climax, as Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg are sentenced to death

48:54.141 --> 48:57.185
for revealing atomic secrets
to Soviet Russia.

48:58.395 --> 49:00.647
The junior senator from
Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy,

49:01.023 --> 49:04.026
is ramping up his investigation
into alleged communists he believes

49:04.192 --> 49:07.195
are infiltrating our government,
our military, and our schools.

49:07.362 --> 49:12.242
...because the enemy has been able
to get the traitors and dupes

49:12.409 --> 49:15.037
to do his work within our government.

49:15.704 --> 49:17.914
One communist on the faculty

49:18.040 --> 49:21.251
of one university
is one communist too many.

49:21.668 --> 49:23.962
A man is either loyal or he's disloyal.

49:30.177 --> 49:31.553
Thank you, Billy.

50:38.453 --> 50:40.038
They're here! They're here! Dad!

50:40.122 --> 50:41.790
Dad! They're home!

50:45.794 --> 50:49.423
I'm being attacked by giants! Ah!

50:49.506 --> 50:52.384
What have you beautiful creatures
done with my little ones?

50:52.467 --> 50:53.468
Oh, Dad, we missed you.

50:53.593 --> 50:56.179
- Christopher. Mitzi.
- Hi, Dad.

50:56.972 --> 50:58.306
My goodness.

50:58.932 --> 51:00.809
Nikola, look at you.

51:00.934 --> 51:02.811
She got real tall.

51:03.812 --> 51:05.105
Oh, is that lipstick?

51:05.230 --> 51:06.523
Dad...

51:08.191 --> 51:11.319
Oh, I've missed you so much. All of you.

51:12.904 --> 51:14.406
Let's go inside. I wanna hear everything.

51:27.002 --> 51:29.212
Oh, I'm terribly sorry...

51:29.504 --> 51:34.384
Oh, Buddy! Well, how are you?

51:35.469 --> 51:37.179
I got nothing to say to you.

51:44.394 --> 51:46.313
Looks like prison has given us the plague.

51:46.480 --> 51:50.734
Yeah, well, that Buddy Ross,
he was always an asshole.

51:51.067 --> 51:52.152
Yeah.

51:52.277 --> 51:53.361
He's in trouble too.

51:53.904 --> 51:55.697
- Three movies, three flops.
- Oh, really?

51:55.822 --> 51:56.907
Mmm-hmm.

51:57.532 --> 51:59.993
Look at him. He's trying to sell his soul,
but he can't find it.

52:02.370 --> 52:05.207
I just hope he stays afloat long enough
to get the shit sued out of him.

52:05.373 --> 52:07.542
Oh, really? By whom?

52:08.043 --> 52:09.294
By me and you and all of us.

52:09.377 --> 52:10.545
Jeez...

52:10.712 --> 52:12.589
We use their capitalist system
against them...

52:12.756 --> 52:14.841
In civil court. We go after their money.

52:15.008 --> 52:16.551
- No. No. No.
- For what they did to us!

52:16.718 --> 52:18.261
We make them swear under oath...

52:18.386 --> 52:20.222
No, no, no. Christ!

52:20.388 --> 52:22.891
Haven't you spent enough time in court?

52:23.058 --> 52:25.101
I know I have. Jesus Christ.

52:25.268 --> 52:26.895
Well, what else are we supposed to do?

52:28.271 --> 52:32.526
We do the one thing
everyone says we can't.

52:36.071 --> 52:39.616
Look, you're a great writer. We make shit.

52:39.741 --> 52:41.243
I don't see it.

52:42.285 --> 52:44.329
Mr. King, I'm a screenwriter.

52:44.412 --> 52:46.540
If I couldn't write shit, I'd starve.

52:46.623 --> 52:48.416
Trumbo, we can't afford you.

52:49.584 --> 52:54.339
Well, how much did you pay
for the script of that?

52:54.422 --> 52:56.758
Bad Men of Tombstone

52:59.594 --> 53:00.762
$1,200.

53:02.597 --> 53:06.852
All right. I'll write you
a movie for $1,200, then.

53:06.935 --> 53:08.645
And you don't want your name on it?

53:08.770 --> 53:10.981
No, you don't want my name on it.

53:11.106 --> 53:12.440
You got that right.

53:13.024 --> 53:17.028
Especially if you're still,
you know, up to stuff.

53:17.112 --> 53:18.196
Are you?

53:18.697 --> 53:20.156
Perpetually.

53:21.491 --> 53:23.118
Jesus.

53:23.618 --> 53:24.786
You got any ideas?

53:25.954 --> 53:28.623
Well, I just got out of prison.

53:28.707 --> 53:30.333
What about crime?

53:30.458 --> 53:33.128
A story of a gangster, his rise and fall.

53:33.211 --> 53:34.838
I've seen that a few times.

53:34.963 --> 53:36.798
Because it always makes money.

53:36.882 --> 53:39.009
All right, when do I get my goods?

53:40.051 --> 53:41.303
Three days.

53:41.386 --> 53:43.763
A 100-page screenplay in three days?

53:43.847 --> 53:45.599
Are you trying to fuck me?

53:45.682 --> 53:47.726
'Cause if you fuck me, I will fuck you.

53:48.977 --> 53:51.146
Mr. King, I've heard this speech.

53:52.731 --> 53:54.649
It was better in jail.

54:31.019 --> 54:32.020
"No, boss...

54:33.855 --> 54:34.940
"He..."

54:40.028 --> 54:43.615
Are you kidding me with this?
Hymie, get out here!

54:45.200 --> 54:49.913
Hymie, pay the man!
He's a genius. Beautiful.

54:50.038 --> 54:53.792
Wait a minute, look.
We got Killer in the Swamp.

54:53.875 --> 54:56.378
The best character's the swamp. Oh, oh.

54:56.544 --> 54:57.545
Women in Prison.

54:57.629 --> 54:59.172
Dames fighting in their underwear.

54:59.255 --> 55:01.466
It's perfect, except it stinks.

55:01.549 --> 55:02.592
What else, Hymie?

55:02.717 --> 55:03.802
Pirates. Can't afford the ocean.

55:04.219 --> 55:05.220
That's it.

55:05.804 --> 55:06.930
Fix them all.

55:07.055 --> 55:10.058
You want more, we got more. Oh, baby!

55:14.229 --> 55:16.523
So, what do you think
of the new neighborhood?

55:16.606 --> 55:18.108
- I like it.
- Yeah, this is nice.

55:18.233 --> 55:19.609
- Yeah, Dad.
- Well...

55:24.322 --> 55:26.241
It's gonna be good being in town.

55:28.410 --> 55:30.120
Whoa, look at that!

55:35.291 --> 55:38.003
- I brought you some lemonade.
- Thank you.

55:38.086 --> 55:39.546
Hard work. You holding up okay?

55:39.629 --> 55:41.256
- Pretty good.
- All right, thank you.

55:49.806 --> 55:50.974
We forgot the towels!

55:51.099 --> 55:53.643
Oh, shoot! Wait for me. Wait for me.

56:21.463 --> 56:23.131
Mitzi... Shh!

56:41.149 --> 56:47.655
Well, there are many angry
and ignorant people in the world.

56:49.157 --> 56:52.160
They seem to be breeding
in record numbers.

56:53.244 --> 56:55.580
Now, all we can do as a family

56:55.663 --> 57:00.085
is stick together and remain vigilant.

57:14.557 --> 57:16.434
The Mouth of Truth.

57:16.518 --> 57:20.063
Legend is that if you're given to lying,
and you put your hand in there,

57:20.188 --> 57:22.273
it'll be bitten off.

57:22.524 --> 57:24.275
Oh, what a horrid idea!

57:25.068 --> 57:26.111
Let's see you do it.

57:31.407 --> 57:33.284
Let's see you do it.

57:35.370 --> 57:36.538
Sure.

57:49.592 --> 57:50.802
Hello.

57:50.885 --> 57:52.554
You beast!

57:53.555 --> 57:56.599
It's a huge hit. Great reviews.

57:56.724 --> 58:00.061
I haven't worked in nine months. You?

58:01.604 --> 58:03.398
Well, there aren't quite enough zeros

58:03.481 --> 58:07.152
in a King Brothers' salary to survive,

58:07.235 --> 58:10.572
but they need scripts like
an army needs toilet paper.

58:10.989 --> 58:14.701
Quality minimum, quantity maximum.

58:14.784 --> 58:19.080
You'd think that when the artistic ambitions
of a movie are non-existent,

58:19.164 --> 58:21.791
the work would be tossed off in a week.

58:21.916 --> 58:25.587
But consistently pleasing
two former pinball salesmen

58:25.670 --> 58:28.464
turns out to be a high hurdle indeed.

58:28.590 --> 58:31.718
And I've become a stranger
in my own house.

58:31.801 --> 58:36.806
Every workweek is seven days.
Every day is 18 hours.

58:36.931 --> 58:39.601
Every minute, I'm further behind.

58:40.602 --> 58:42.645
They need five of you.

58:46.191 --> 58:48.985
Okay, the only question
is, can these pinkos write?

58:49.110 --> 58:51.905
Well, the dapper gentleman
in the gray suit

58:51.988 --> 58:54.157
is Ian McLellan Hunter.

58:54.282 --> 58:55.408
Guy who wrote Roman Holiday.

58:55.491 --> 58:57.285
Guy who just got subpoenaed.

58:57.368 --> 58:59.787
Guy who just got nominated
for an Academy Award.

58:59.871 --> 59:02.540
Everyone at that table's been nominated.

59:03.333 --> 59:07.879
There's Alvah Bessie,
and Adrian Scott. Arlen Hird.

59:07.962 --> 59:11.966
And Ring Lardner, Jr.
and Albert Maltz and...

59:14.802 --> 59:16.304
Um...

59:16.387 --> 59:18.181
It'll be like this.

59:18.306 --> 59:20.558
I'll find the writer and work with him.

59:20.642 --> 59:22.602
He'll deliver the script to me.

59:22.685 --> 59:24.187
If it's good, I'll give it to you.

59:24.312 --> 59:27.357
If it needs work, I'll fix it.

59:27.815 --> 59:29.984
No one gets paid until you're happy.

59:30.068 --> 59:33.321
And these writers, they're...
They're all...

59:34.322 --> 59:35.990
I mean, they're all black...

59:36.074 --> 59:37.075
Blacklisted.

59:37.158 --> 59:38.618
Jesus, you're such a chicken-shit.

59:39.994 --> 59:41.955
You know, we're at war
with the communists.

59:42.038 --> 59:44.123
- No we're not.
- It's a new kind of war.

59:44.207 --> 59:46.000
Yeah, if it doesn't exist, very new.

59:46.501 --> 59:49.420
What about the Rosenbergs?

59:49.545 --> 59:50.588
They stole the atom bomb.

59:50.672 --> 59:53.174
They didn't steal it off
a fucking camera truck.

59:54.092 --> 59:57.262
So look, we bought a gorilla suit.

59:58.846 --> 01:00:00.056
We gotta use it.

01:00:04.352 --> 01:00:05.353
Oh.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:07.605
Well.

01:00:07.689 --> 01:00:09.274
So, you had five jobs.

01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:10.358
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:12.402
And now we got them and now you got none?

01:00:12.527 --> 01:00:16.239
Oh, now I'm free to get five
more jobs and five more writers.

01:00:16.364 --> 01:00:20.326
And you each get five more jobs
and five more writers and so on.

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:23.079
To keep that going, we'd have
to write every script in the business.

01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:27.166
Oh, Arlen, what a devious lad.

01:00:28.543 --> 01:00:31.170
So who wants to write a gorilla movie?

01:00:31.254 --> 01:00:32.922
Who doesn't?

01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:36.342
We now work at midnight

01:00:36.426 --> 01:00:40.430
in thick fog among strangers.

01:00:42.557 --> 01:00:43.933
Not literally.

01:00:44.392 --> 01:00:46.311
We're running a family business.

01:00:46.394 --> 01:00:48.980
We'll be adding new phone lines,

01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:52.942
and when answering, never say,
"Trumbo residence."

01:00:53.067 --> 01:00:57.322
I'll be writing for various producers
under different names.

01:00:57.405 --> 01:00:59.782
Whomever they ask for, you come find me.

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:01.075
Or take a message.

01:01:06.748 --> 01:01:07.915
Hello?

01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:09.125
Is John Abbott there?

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:10.752
No, sir, may I take a message?

01:01:10.835 --> 01:01:14.130
The door must be answered at all hours.

01:01:16.132 --> 01:01:19.260
Got a pickup for Sally Stubblefield.

01:01:22.472 --> 01:01:24.015
Can I get your mom to sign?

01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:29.687
Thank you.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.027
Dictation, shorthand
and typing will be learned.

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:40.365
Those of legal age will have one
of the most important jobs imaginable.

01:01:40.448 --> 01:01:41.449
Courier.

01:01:42.367 --> 01:01:46.954
Scripts must be delivered to producers
without raising suspicion.

01:01:47.038 --> 01:01:49.791
Any questions? Concerns?

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:52.377
- Yes, Nikola.
- Is there a schedule?

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:53.503
A what?

01:01:53.628 --> 01:01:54.712
I need to know when I can do homework.

01:01:54.796 --> 01:01:58.132
And I'm part of a fundraising committee
for Negro voting rights.

01:01:58.216 --> 01:02:01.552
Plus, every other Friday,
we have meetings for Student Council.

01:02:01.636 --> 01:02:02.970
I'm... I have to...

01:02:03.054 --> 01:02:05.056
Niki, we'll figure
something out, sweetheart.

01:02:05.807 --> 01:02:06.808
Won't we?

01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:12.522
And protests continued
as the Supreme Court may soon take up

01:02:12.647 --> 01:02:14.649
the issue of racial segregation.

01:02:14.982 --> 01:02:19.028
Negros in Southern towns and cities have
taken to the streets in large numbers.

01:02:19.153 --> 01:02:22.490
All under close scrutiny
by local law enforcement.

01:02:22.573 --> 01:02:26.369
There have been unconfirmed reports
of disturbances and rioting.

01:02:26.494 --> 01:02:30.289
But it is not clear if the violence
was initiated by protesters...

01:02:30.373 --> 01:02:31.916
Nikola!

01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:33.584
...or white vigilante groups.

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:36.295
Beyond the South, through the nation...

01:02:36.379 --> 01:02:38.673
Now, there you go.

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:41.008
A few mistakes, not many.

01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:42.593
All right.

01:02:42.677 --> 01:02:45.513
...all top-salaried government officials

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:48.015
should make a full public statement
of their income...

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:51.519
This concludes our program
scheduled for today.

01:03:16.627 --> 01:03:19.630
Which one is Graham Tauper?

01:03:21.382 --> 01:03:22.842
Nympho Nun.

01:03:22.925 --> 01:03:24.051
Oh.

01:03:24.177 --> 01:03:25.261
Great job.

01:03:26.095 --> 01:03:29.515
Uh, Elwood Carr, Murder at the Circus.

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:31.476
It needs work. I knew the clown did it.

01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:33.227
It's always the clown.

01:03:34.395 --> 01:03:36.939
So you are The Alien and the Farm Girl.

01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:38.065
Yeah.

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:42.111
So you wrote the alien talking
about the rights of the worker.

01:03:42.778 --> 01:03:44.947
The pathology of capitalism.

01:03:45.573 --> 01:03:48.159
The complacency of the bourgeoisie.

01:03:48.242 --> 01:03:50.703
I don't even know what it is
and I fucking hate it.

01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:52.538
Well, the idea was to use the...

01:03:52.622 --> 01:03:54.248
I paid you to write a script about

01:03:54.332 --> 01:03:58.878
a guy with a giant bug head
shtupping a girl in a hayloft.

01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:00.129
And you write shit

01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:03.674
that's gonna get me
subpoenaed, and stinks!

01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:06.302
Fix it!

01:04:07.136 --> 01:04:08.638
Well, fuck Frank King.

01:04:08.763 --> 01:04:11.516
I said, until he's happy, I'd rewrite.

01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:15.269
So you're gonna stay up
with that all night, for that crap?

01:04:15.353 --> 01:04:16.354
For what?

01:04:16.437 --> 01:04:19.023
To get it to his high literary
and political standards?

01:04:19.106 --> 01:04:22.818
Well, it shouldn't be to anyone's
political standards.

01:04:22.944 --> 01:04:25.655
It's The Alien and the Farm Girl,
for Christ's sake.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.114
What the hell were you thinking?

01:04:27.198 --> 01:04:28.533
I was thinking.

01:04:28.616 --> 01:04:32.036
That's why I'm a writer.
To say things that matter.

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:33.454
Remember that?

01:04:33.538 --> 01:04:37.667
I was a reporter. I was
nominated for a Pulitzer.

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:41.128
I fought in Spain,
and I know Ernest Hemingway.

01:04:41.212 --> 01:04:43.965
- I actually... I know him.
- Oh, bullshit.

01:04:44.048 --> 01:04:45.174
And he knows me.

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:47.677
If I walked into a bar in Paris, he...

01:04:47.802 --> 01:04:49.136
Maybe not my name, but he'll...

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.263
I'll get a wave.

01:04:50.346 --> 01:04:51.681
Yeah.

01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:54.809
You... You won the
National fucking Book Award.

01:04:55.393 --> 01:04:56.852
I mean, what are we doing?

01:05:01.524 --> 01:05:02.525
Okay, so the alien...

01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:05.570
The alien impregnates the farm girl.

01:05:05.653 --> 01:05:06.737
- Right.
- Why?

01:05:06.821 --> 01:05:10.283
Because he wants to inseminate her
and propagate a new species

01:05:10.366 --> 01:05:11.534
- on Earth and take over?
- No.

01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:15.162
Because she reminds him
of the girl he left behind.

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:16.789
But he's got a bug head.

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:19.000
His girlfriend's probably got
a bug head back home.

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:21.294
You don't get hung up
on the looks of someone.

01:05:21.377 --> 01:05:22.837
He's falling in love with her.

01:05:23.838 --> 01:05:25.256
Uh, okay.

01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:27.592
You're over-thinking.

01:05:32.263 --> 01:05:34.098
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:35.891
You want to do this later?

01:05:36.017 --> 01:05:37.685
No. Go, please.

01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:42.231
All right.

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:46.444
I mean, do you ever miss
writing something...

01:05:46.527 --> 01:05:47.903
Forget great, just good?

01:05:49.196 --> 01:05:52.033
I mean, you must have ideas still, right?

01:05:52.908 --> 01:05:54.702
I've got a few.

01:05:54.785 --> 01:05:57.705
There's one that won't go away.

01:05:57.788 --> 01:06:03.502
Cleo and I are in Mexico
at a bullfight years ago.

01:06:03.586 --> 01:06:06.589
And the bull dies.

01:06:06.756 --> 01:06:11.010
And, uh, thousands of people
are just cheering.

01:06:11.093 --> 01:06:12.928
Three weren't.

01:06:13.054 --> 01:06:17.933
Cleo, me and this young boy down front,

01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:21.604
crying.

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:26.108
Always wondered why.

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.488
Well, you write it and you'll know.

01:06:32.615 --> 01:06:37.411
But please promise me,
not for Frank fucking King.

01:06:38.663 --> 01:06:39.914
Please.

01:06:41.582 --> 01:06:45.294
To present the writing awards,
here is an actor who also reads.

01:06:45.378 --> 01:06:46.796
Mr. Kirk Douglas.

01:06:46.879 --> 01:06:49.840
Niki, hurry!

01:06:49.924 --> 01:06:52.009
Who's doing it?

01:06:52.093 --> 01:06:53.427
Kirk Douglas!

01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:54.887
I'm coming, I'm coming!

01:06:58.891 --> 01:07:00.184
The envelope.

01:07:02.436 --> 01:07:05.648
And the Oscar goes to

01:07:05.731 --> 01:07:08.567
Roman Holiday by Ian McLellan Hunter.

01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:12.905
Yes! That's you, Dad, that's you!

01:07:12.988 --> 01:07:15.199
Dad, that is fantastic!

01:07:19.537 --> 01:07:22.623
This is accepted on behalf
of Ian McLellan Hunter.

01:07:22.707 --> 01:07:24.917
So do we get to be happy now?

01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:38.889
I don't want it.

01:07:38.973 --> 01:07:40.933
Well, I don't want it.

01:07:41.016 --> 01:07:42.309
Your name's on it.

01:07:43.644 --> 01:07:44.770
You wrote it.

01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:46.731
They gave it to you.

01:07:48.816 --> 01:07:50.860
And it's done me wonders.

01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:54.321
Here's the gorilla script.

01:07:54.947 --> 01:07:55.948
Huh.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.533
- Hey, Dad.
- Ah?

01:07:57.616 --> 01:07:59.201
Phone for you.

01:07:59.326 --> 01:08:00.953
For which name?

01:08:01.036 --> 01:08:03.414
No, you. Some guy named Buddy Ross.

01:08:03.497 --> 01:08:04.498
Huh.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:11.088
So, is the rumor true?
You wrote Roman Holiday?

01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:15.968
What can I do for you, Buddy?

01:08:16.594 --> 01:08:20.848
My movies have all bombed.
Dug me into a hole.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.767
I finally got something going.

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:23.975
Classy.

01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:27.520
Three big stars. The script...

01:08:29.231 --> 01:08:32.109
What script? There is no script.

01:08:32.193 --> 01:08:34.653
I got 11 writers who fucked me
and now the actors are gonna pull out.

01:08:34.737 --> 01:08:38.698
And if they do, I lose everything.

01:08:39.325 --> 01:08:41.702
When do you shoot?

01:08:41.786 --> 01:08:43.120
Ten days.

01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:45.790
Is there anything?

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:54.924
There'd be no credit, obviously.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:57.009
I can't pay you till we start shooting.

01:09:00.638 --> 01:09:03.474
I wouldn't blame you
if you spit in my face.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.977
But we did good stuff back then.

01:09:08.437 --> 01:09:09.979
We really did.

01:09:13.776 --> 01:09:15.109
Please.

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:22.158
I owe the King Brothers a rewrite.

01:09:22.243 --> 01:09:23.868
And I can't do both.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.706
Here it is. I need you to take over.

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:30.709
So you can help that
great guy, Buddy Ross.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:31.794
Mmm-mmm.

01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:34.129
So we can keep tearing down the blacklist.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.340
Oh, Jesus, here we go.

01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:39.051
This is going to be a very big movie,
and if Buddy gets a good script...

01:09:39.134 --> 01:09:40.135
Which you're gonna give him.

01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:41.845
No, which I am going to sell him.

01:09:41.929 --> 01:09:43.471
For money, 'cause that's why
we did all of this, right?

01:09:43.555 --> 01:09:44.598
Was for the money.

01:09:44.682 --> 01:09:46.975
Why can you not see this?

01:09:47.059 --> 01:09:51.229
If we get one big movie,
we can get all the big movies.

01:09:51.313 --> 01:09:54.567
And then this whole rotten thing
could collapse on the sheer irony

01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:57.194
that every unemployable
writer is employed.

01:09:57.278 --> 01:09:59.446
Jesus Christ, do you
have to say everything

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.824
like it's going to be
chiseled into a rock?

01:10:01.907 --> 01:10:04.201
I'm not gonna help you help Buddy Ross!

01:10:04.285 --> 01:10:05.744
God's sake!

01:10:05.828 --> 01:10:07.454
- You are against every...
- No, I...

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.915
- ...solid idea that comes up.
- Let's do something!

01:10:09.999 --> 01:10:11.667
These fuckers did things!

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:14.962
We should be suing that
cockroach into the ground

01:10:15.087 --> 01:10:17.131
- along with those congressmen...
- There's an idea.

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:18.215
- Yes, and the producers!
- Very good one.

01:10:18.299 --> 01:10:19.717
- Yes, and the studios!
- That'll be better.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.677
- We should sue them!
- Oh, yes, brilliant!

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.179
Keep losing. Give all of your money
away to lawyers!

01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:25.848
I'd rather lose for the right reasons.

01:10:25.931 --> 01:10:27.016
Why?

01:10:27.099 --> 01:10:29.393
It's still losing.

01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:34.315
You lose. I lose. We all lose!

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:36.233
Don't you see that?

01:10:36.317 --> 01:10:39.862
And the whole goddamn country
stays scared and dead.

01:10:40.529 --> 01:10:42.990
Well, you really think you can
go on living like this forever?

01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:44.867
Well, I'm not gonna have to.

01:10:47.745 --> 01:10:51.665
Arlen, we can do this.

01:10:51.749 --> 01:10:54.001
We can beat them. We can win!

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:55.961
- I don't care if I win.
- Bullshit!

01:10:56.045 --> 01:10:57.171
Everybody wants to win.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:59.798
No, you want to win.
I want to change things.

01:10:59.882 --> 01:11:02.593
- I want to win so that I can change things.
- No, you don't!

01:11:02.676 --> 01:11:05.554
You want to win so that you can get
an Oscar with your name on it this time.

01:11:05.638 --> 01:11:09.683
And so you can get more money that you
burn through, writing shit for idiots!

01:11:09.767 --> 01:11:13.187
Why do I have to explain everything
to you like you're a fucking child?

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:14.271
You don't have to.

01:11:14.355 --> 01:11:15.648
- You really don't have to.
- Piss off!

01:11:15.731 --> 01:11:18.317
You know, you do what you do
and that's fine for you.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.945
But don't pretend that
you getting your career back

01:11:21.028 --> 01:11:23.864
is part of some great crusade
for mankind. Okay?

01:11:23.948 --> 01:11:25.950
I'm doing this for everyone.

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:30.621
Arlen...

01:11:43.676 --> 01:11:46.220
Fucking idiot.

01:12:28.387 --> 01:12:32.391
Happy birthday to you

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:36.979
Happy birthday, dear Nikola

01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:42.192
Happy birthday to you

01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.403
Make a wish.

01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:46.321
Ah.

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:47.990
I got it.

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:50.367
Sweet 16!

01:12:50.451 --> 01:12:52.077
Get together with your sister.

01:12:52.161 --> 01:12:53.328
Chris, get in there.

01:12:53.704 --> 01:12:55.622
Ah. Thank you.

01:12:55.706 --> 01:12:57.374
Are you sure we shouldn't go knock?

01:12:58.208 --> 01:12:59.501
I'm sure.

01:12:59.585 --> 01:13:00.794
He can't take five minutes?

01:13:00.919 --> 01:13:02.087
Nope.

01:13:03.047 --> 01:13:04.256
Two minutes?

01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:05.549
Niki.

01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:07.509
One minute.

01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:13.849
Chris, would you please
get the good plates?

01:13:13.932 --> 01:13:15.601
- Yes, Mom.
- Thank you.

01:13:19.855 --> 01:13:21.106
Dad!

01:13:22.983 --> 01:13:24.902
- Dad!
- Go away!

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:27.946
We're having birthday cake.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:31.784
When you hear me working, you don't knock!

01:13:31.867 --> 01:13:33.744
But it's my birthday.

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:36.121
You don't knock! Ever!

01:13:36.205 --> 01:13:38.832
So the house is on fire,
you don't want to know?

01:13:38.916 --> 01:13:42.669
I work in a bathtub, surrounded by water.

01:13:42.753 --> 01:13:46.632
So I'm fairly certain that even
if the whole goddamn country was on fire,

01:13:46.715 --> 01:13:50.135
that I could still function
as this family's personal slave.

01:13:50.219 --> 01:13:52.971
And all I ask is to not be interrupted

01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:56.308
for every little slice
of fucking birthday cake!

01:13:57.559 --> 01:13:59.895
What? It's ridiculous!

01:14:01.021 --> 01:14:04.399
Now I've lost my place. Christ's sake!

01:14:09.071 --> 01:14:13.408
...sure, maybe you, uh,
get that long, happy life we all want.

01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:16.203
But your eyes never really close again.

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:20.916
'Cause you spend that life
scared of every noise in the dark.

01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:25.337
We both do.
I can't let you do this, Rocco.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.965
I'll just have to convince you I'm right.

01:14:40.644 --> 01:14:45.023
After all, kid, what are friends for?

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:03.041
Don't defend him, okay?

01:15:03.125 --> 01:15:05.169
He knows he's wrong.

01:15:05.252 --> 01:15:07.462
He hasn't even apologized.

01:15:07.546 --> 01:15:08.797
I think you surprised him.

01:15:09.381 --> 01:15:11.842
He's not used to seeing
another adult in the house.

01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:14.469
He has to be right all the time.

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:16.597
How do you stand it?

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.016
Well, it's challenging sometimes,
especially lately.

01:15:21.018 --> 01:15:23.437
Hey, why don't you come
downstairs with me?

01:15:24.021 --> 01:15:25.397
I wanna show you something.

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:32.905
You see my gloves?

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:37.284
Thank you.

01:15:47.628 --> 01:15:49.713
Do you imagine that's his head?

01:15:53.258 --> 01:15:56.011
No. But you can.

01:16:11.235 --> 01:16:14.363
Niki, is that the script already?

01:16:14.446 --> 01:16:15.447
Fantastic.

01:16:15.948 --> 01:16:18.075
Ah. Tell your dad that...

01:16:41.181 --> 01:16:45.060
Oh, hello. Um, I'm looking for Arlen Hird.

01:16:45.143 --> 01:16:46.937
Mr. Trumbo, it's Andrew.

01:16:47.938 --> 01:16:51.233
Good God! Look... Look at you!

01:16:52.317 --> 01:16:55.821
Wow. Well, I'm certain your father

01:16:55.904 --> 01:16:58.532
has told you some nasty things about me,

01:16:58.615 --> 01:17:00.033
but I want to assure you,

01:17:00.117 --> 01:17:02.828
they're all true.

01:17:02.911 --> 01:17:05.163
Is, uh... Is he home?

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.334
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.103
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you so much.

01:17:32.107 --> 01:17:33.442
Andrew.

01:17:35.485 --> 01:17:37.362
Joshua.

01:17:37.446 --> 01:17:40.449
My dad left something for you.

01:17:40.532 --> 01:17:41.658
It's a record.

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:45.245
Money that he owed you
and some other people.

01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:50.292
I'm sorry. I wish we could pay you back.

01:17:53.128 --> 01:17:54.421
Andrew, no.

01:17:56.048 --> 01:17:57.591
I owed him.

01:18:01.345 --> 01:18:03.305
The debts are all mine.

01:18:05.932 --> 01:18:07.267
Thank you.

01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:30.957
Well...

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:32.626
Hello, Eddie.

01:18:35.796 --> 01:18:37.923
This is a bit of a surprise.

01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:44.388
What can I do for you?

01:18:45.055 --> 01:18:46.556
Arlen died.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.850
I heard. I was on location.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:57.359
This is the money you gave us
for the defense fund.

01:18:57.442 --> 01:18:59.694
It's everything that we owe you.
Arlen included.

01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:02.030
No, now, that was a gift.

01:19:02.239 --> 01:19:04.324
We'd like it off our books.

01:19:06.034 --> 01:19:09.287
What is this supposed to be?
Some kind of message?

01:19:10.622 --> 01:19:13.959
What you and Arlen and the great
Hollywood Ten all think of me.

01:19:19.548 --> 01:19:22.509
Fine. Fine. But first you're gonna listen.

01:19:26.555 --> 01:19:28.682
After you went to jail,

01:19:31.017 --> 01:19:33.353
I didn't work for a year.

01:19:35.605 --> 01:19:38.024
No offers, not even an audition.

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:43.196
People would see me, cross the street.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.364
People I loved.

01:19:46.575 --> 01:19:48.493
People I made rich.

01:19:50.287 --> 01:19:51.663
I sat in front of that committee.

01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:54.332
Why? I didn't do anything.

01:19:54.416 --> 01:19:57.878
None of us did anything.
We were all stupid babies.

01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:01.590
With no business in any of it.

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:04.634
I just wanted my life back.

01:20:06.303 --> 01:20:10.056
They had every name.
Yours, Arlen's, everybody's.

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:14.394
I didn't give them anything
they didn't already have.

01:20:14.478 --> 01:20:19.357
I ended it, is all. I just... I ended it!

01:20:19.441 --> 01:20:25.197
Oh, Eddie, you don't
end something like this.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.242
By giving them what
they have no right to ask.

01:20:29.326 --> 01:20:32.537
You're gonna tell me
how I should have handled it?

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.624
Like you handled Congress?

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:40.045
So you're saying that
you're proud of what you did?

01:20:40.128 --> 01:20:43.924
Proud? Who the hell gets to be proud?

01:20:44.007 --> 01:20:45.425
You. You do.

01:20:45.509 --> 01:20:47.552
You with your fake names and your fronts.

01:20:47.636 --> 01:20:49.012
You've got all the work you want.

01:20:49.095 --> 01:20:52.098
I gotta go out in the world every day.

01:20:52.182 --> 01:20:53.767
This is my work.

01:20:56.061 --> 01:20:58.772
I've got nobody else to be.

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:00.941
I did what I had to.

01:21:01.024 --> 01:21:03.109
You did what you wanted, Eddie.

01:21:04.528 --> 01:21:06.530
And you did it for more.

01:21:07.948 --> 01:21:10.867
More movies, more money,

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:14.663
more dead bullshit on your walls.

01:21:22.462 --> 01:21:27.175
What I did, I did, but did you
ever wonder how many years

01:21:27.259 --> 01:21:29.427
you hacked off Arlen's life?

01:21:31.054 --> 01:21:34.641
To show the world
what a rebel genius you are.

01:21:39.312 --> 01:21:41.231
You live with that!

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.662
Drinking alone?

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:58.331
Preferably.

01:21:59.541 --> 01:22:02.085
And what are you up to these days?

01:22:04.296 --> 01:22:08.133
You know, Hedda, another one
of these and I just may tell you.

01:22:08.216 --> 01:22:09.801
Oh, then I'm buying.

01:22:10.594 --> 01:22:11.845
Usual. Same again.

01:22:12.012 --> 01:22:13.263
Yes, Miss Hopper.

01:22:14.723 --> 01:22:17.100
Oh, come on, I hear the rumors.

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.314
Show me you're still in the game,
fighting the good fight.

01:22:23.648 --> 01:22:25.525
Come on, rub my face in it.

01:22:25.609 --> 01:22:27.902
Whisper a movie you've written in secret.

01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:29.487
Maybe I've even heard of it.

01:22:31.781 --> 01:22:33.116
Maybe you have.

01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:36.119
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry...
I'm filming. It's crazy.

01:22:36.202 --> 01:22:38.872
Buddy, do you know Dalton Trumbo?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.587
Yes, I believe we have
worked together before.

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:47.172
What was it? Was it MGM?

01:22:47.255 --> 01:22:49.633
A million years ago.
Nice to see you again, Buddy.

01:22:50.884 --> 01:22:52.677
I hear your new script's in trouble.

01:22:52.761 --> 01:22:54.304
Maybe you should hire Dalton.

01:22:54.387 --> 01:22:57.682
He used to be pretty good,
and price-wise, he'd be bargain basement.

01:22:57.766 --> 01:23:01.227
Not that you'd ever do it.
Not after Buddy named names.

01:23:03.188 --> 01:23:05.690
Oh, you didn't know?

01:23:05.774 --> 01:23:07.901
Word was he had hired someone
he shouldn't have.

01:23:07.984 --> 01:23:10.987
So he got subpoenaed. He had to testify.

01:23:11.071 --> 01:23:13.657
Closed session. No press. Makes it easier.

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.659
So, he named you, of course.

01:23:17.285 --> 01:23:20.038
Now he's been cleared.
Gets to make his movie.

01:23:20.121 --> 01:23:22.707
In a way, thanks to you.

01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:31.341
Drink, Buddy? You look as if you need one.

01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:33.968
Can you believe it?

01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:36.680
Democrats voting for segregation.

01:23:36.763 --> 01:23:38.848
Oh, the Southern Dixie-crats.

01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:41.309
We started a petition
for total integration.

01:23:41.393 --> 01:23:42.477
There it is.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.020
I already have over 1,000 signatures.

01:23:44.104 --> 01:23:47.857
Well, I'd be happy to make it 1,001.

01:23:47.941 --> 01:23:49.776
And this is the new draft

01:23:49.859 --> 01:23:53.238
that needs to be delivered
to Hymie King in Agoura.

01:23:54.531 --> 01:23:56.950
Wait, Agoura? I thought
the Kings were in Hollywood.

01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:58.702
Oh, no, no, no. These are the rewrites.

01:23:58.785 --> 01:24:01.830
They're to be shot tonight, so Hymie
needs them on the set right away.

01:24:01.913 --> 01:24:03.456
Agoura's 40 miles.

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.625
Yes, I'm sure Chris knows that by now.

01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:06.710
Well, he can't.

01:24:08.378 --> 01:24:09.421
I'm sorry?

01:24:09.504 --> 01:24:12.132
He has a date. He's taking her to a movie.

01:24:12.215 --> 01:24:17.178
Well, all right, then, Nikola,
you'll deliver the draft.

01:24:17.262 --> 01:24:18.263
I have a protest.

01:24:18.346 --> 01:24:20.765
Since when do protests
have hard start times?

01:24:21.433 --> 01:24:22.434
I'll take it.

01:24:22.559 --> 01:24:23.560
Nikola will take it.

01:24:23.643 --> 01:24:25.437
I said I can't.

01:24:25.562 --> 01:24:27.313
Young lady, you will.

01:24:27.397 --> 01:24:28.481
This is important.

01:24:28.606 --> 01:24:29.649
So is this.

01:24:29.733 --> 01:24:31.317
This is important to me.

01:24:31.401 --> 01:24:34.863
And the date's important to Chris,
so figure something else out.

01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:46.541
Move on! He needs those now!

01:24:59.637 --> 01:25:01.347
Oh, honey...

01:25:03.016 --> 01:25:06.853
She hasn't been gone that long,
and it's really not that late.

01:25:10.190 --> 01:25:13.693
You know, this is a blatant attempt
to manipulate worry.

01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:23.119
Do you know when I realized
that I had to leave Hal?

01:25:23.203 --> 01:25:25.371
Hal? Hal who?

01:25:25.455 --> 01:25:27.123
My first husband Hal.

01:25:27.207 --> 01:25:29.334
Jesus, take the wheel!

01:25:31.377 --> 01:25:32.879
It was my wedding night.

01:25:34.005 --> 01:25:36.216
My first wedding night with Hal.

01:25:36.299 --> 01:25:39.469
If we're going to go back in time
to that unholy coupling,

01:25:39.552 --> 01:25:42.639
then I have a medical obligation to drink.

01:25:43.056 --> 01:25:45.683
I saw this was not a man
I could have children with.

01:25:46.017 --> 01:25:47.644
Now, thank God for that.

01:25:47.727 --> 01:25:51.397
He'd bully me and them.

01:25:51.523 --> 01:25:54.734
And that we'd wind up like
every miserable family since forever.

01:25:55.693 --> 01:25:56.903
But you...

01:25:58.029 --> 01:26:01.074
I knew you would never be like that.

01:26:01.199 --> 01:26:04.077
That whatever happened out there,

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.328
all that would matter,

01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:08.331
really matter, was us.

01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:10.208
Well, all that matters is us.

01:26:10.333 --> 01:26:12.085
No.

01:26:13.503 --> 01:26:14.504
Not anymore.

01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:15.672
Well...

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:19.259
You have no idea what you could lose.

01:26:19.342 --> 01:26:20.593
Oh, please!

01:26:20.677 --> 01:26:22.762
My career

01:26:22.887 --> 01:26:24.931
and the First Amendment, our country.

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:26.140
Am I missing anything?

01:26:26.266 --> 01:26:27.433
Us.

01:26:27.517 --> 01:26:30.019
- You're losing us.
- Oh.

01:26:30.103 --> 01:26:34.691
Since prison, you don't talk or ask.

01:26:34.774 --> 01:26:36.776
You just snap and bark.

01:26:36.901 --> 01:26:39.863
I keep waiting for you to start
pounding the dinner table with a gavel.

01:26:39.946 --> 01:26:44.033
So in addition to being
a pariah out in the world,

01:26:44.117 --> 01:26:47.662
I also have the supreme joy
of battling insurrection

01:26:47.787 --> 01:26:49.706
- in my own home where these...
- Battling insurrection?

01:26:49.789 --> 01:26:53.459
...ten fingers literally
clothe and feed and shelter us.

01:26:53.585 --> 01:26:55.795
This isn't just happening to you!

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.714
We all hurt!

01:26:57.797 --> 01:27:00.967
Niki, me, your friends!

01:27:01.092 --> 01:27:03.219
Friends? What friends?

01:27:03.303 --> 01:27:06.222
Who the hell has the luxury of friends?

01:27:06.306 --> 01:27:08.474
I've got allies and enemies.

01:27:08.558 --> 01:27:10.226
There's no room for anything else.

01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:11.394
We know.

01:27:12.812 --> 01:27:13.813
Good.

01:27:13.938 --> 01:27:16.649
Then this discussion ends.

01:27:17.942 --> 01:27:21.237
This isn't a discussion. It's a fight.

01:27:22.989 --> 01:27:26.326
I will not let our children
be raised by a bully.

01:27:43.468 --> 01:27:44.469
Be back.

01:27:44.594 --> 01:27:45.595
All right.

01:27:56.648 --> 01:28:00.985
I didn't want to fight in front
of my friends, but I'm not going home.

01:28:02.195 --> 01:28:03.947
I didn't come here to fight.

01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:13.456
You know, your mother is a quiet person.

01:28:13.539 --> 01:28:14.540
Normally.

01:28:15.375 --> 01:28:16.542
The effect of which is that

01:28:16.668 --> 01:28:19.712
she can actually make me hear myself.

01:28:19.796 --> 01:28:21.381
It's extraordinary.

01:28:22.382 --> 01:28:26.678
Lately, it's not a sound I like much.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:31.891
Mostly because what I hear is just how...

01:28:32.976 --> 01:28:36.229
How afraid I am.

01:28:38.898 --> 01:28:43.069
Afraid that I'm scarring you...

01:28:43.194 --> 01:28:44.737
All of you.

01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:53.246
And what if it's all for nothing?
What then?

01:28:56.416 --> 01:29:01.421
Well, so, I fight.

01:29:03.339 --> 01:29:05.925
It's all I know how to do anymore.

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:07.760
Any... I mean, it's just...

01:29:07.844 --> 01:29:11.889
Just rage at anyone who gets in my way.

01:29:14.267 --> 01:29:19.689
But you have never been in my way, Nikola.

01:29:19.772 --> 01:29:21.733
Not once.

01:29:22.775 --> 01:29:25.403
It's crazy how mad you make me.

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.533
Since all I ever wanted
was to be just like you.

01:29:34.537 --> 01:29:38.791
Well, I'm afraid to say
that you've succeeded.

01:29:43.129 --> 01:29:44.881
We know, okay?

01:29:44.964 --> 01:29:47.800
It's a small town.
The gossip's always true.

01:29:47.925 --> 01:29:50.720
Fire Dalton Trumbo and the rest of them

01:29:50.803 --> 01:29:53.222
or you got pickets,
headlines and boycotts.

01:29:53.306 --> 01:29:55.266
We will put you right out of business.

01:29:55.808 --> 01:29:56.893
We?

01:29:56.976 --> 01:30:01.314
The Motion Picture Alliance
for the Preservation of American Ideals.

01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:03.733
Me and Ronald Reagan, Hedda Hopper,

01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:06.319
guilds, studio heads, John Wayne.

01:30:06.444 --> 01:30:07.570
I love John Wayne.

01:30:07.695 --> 01:30:08.821
Well, I'll introduce you.

01:30:08.946 --> 01:30:10.490
You guys could do a movie together.

01:30:10.615 --> 01:30:12.742
Oh, gee, that would be swell.

01:30:12.825 --> 01:30:15.203
Except I don't think

01:30:15.328 --> 01:30:16.788
- you and me are gonna be pals.
- Hey, Frank!

01:30:16.954 --> 01:30:19.082
- You wanna keep me from hiring union?
- Frank! Frank!

01:30:19.165 --> 01:30:21.834
I'll go downtown, hire a bunch
of winos and hookers!

01:30:22.502 --> 01:30:23.586
It doesn't matter!

01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:25.463
- I make garbage!
- Frank!

01:30:26.506 --> 01:30:29.133
You want to call me a pinko
in the papers? Do it!

01:30:29.258 --> 01:30:32.136
- None of the people that go
to my fucking movies can read! - No, wait.

01:30:34.597 --> 01:30:38.101
I am in this for the money and the pussy
and they're both falling off the trees.

01:30:38.476 --> 01:30:40.019
Take it away from me.

01:30:40.103 --> 01:30:41.270
Go ahead. I won't sue you,

01:30:41.354 --> 01:30:45.274
but this will be the last fucking thing
you see before I beat you to death with it.

01:30:45.358 --> 01:30:46.359
Tiffany!

01:30:46.442 --> 01:30:47.693
Right here.

01:30:59.372 --> 01:31:00.623
Fuck you want?

01:31:01.499 --> 01:31:03.626
Uh... Oh, uh...

01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:05.461
- New script.
- Oh, yeah?

01:31:05.545 --> 01:31:09.882
Yes, it's a family picture.

01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:12.218
Something I've been mulling.

01:31:12.343 --> 01:31:16.139
It's the story of a young
Mexican boy and his pet bull.

01:31:16.556 --> 01:31:18.558
Sounds a little fruity. What's it called?

01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:22.979
The Brave One. Oh, one problem though.

01:31:23.062 --> 01:31:24.230
Expensive?

01:31:24.397 --> 01:31:25.565
Worse.

01:31:26.566 --> 01:31:28.151
It's good.

01:31:38.244 --> 01:31:41.080
Olé! Olé!

01:31:45.168 --> 01:31:49.088
Who told you? What else did they say?

01:31:52.592 --> 01:31:53.759
Well...

01:31:54.427 --> 01:31:57.555
You too. And thank you, Frank.

01:32:00.099 --> 01:32:01.350
What?

01:32:03.603 --> 01:32:07.064
The Brave One has been nominated
for an Academy Award.

01:32:07.273 --> 01:32:08.733
Oh.

01:32:11.277 --> 01:32:14.197
- Really?
- Yes, really!

01:32:16.782 --> 01:32:18.534
That's crazy.

01:32:19.076 --> 01:32:20.870
I don't know. It's like Roman Holiday.

01:32:20.953 --> 01:32:23.372
Oh, Hymie, this is nothing
like Roman Holiday.

01:32:23.956 --> 01:32:26.959
Roman Holiday had a guy
with a name and a body

01:32:27.084 --> 01:32:29.045
they could give the award to.

01:32:29.128 --> 01:32:33.591
There is no Robert Rich.
Who gets the thing if it wins?

01:32:34.383 --> 01:32:36.052
Well, maybe it won't.

01:32:36.135 --> 01:32:38.721
I mean, it's not that good. No offense.

01:32:38.804 --> 01:32:40.223
None taken.

01:32:40.306 --> 01:32:42.558
And now I'd like to say
two of the most beautiful words

01:32:42.642 --> 01:32:45.811
in the motion-picture industry,
Deborah Kerr.

01:32:51.984 --> 01:32:55.321
The nominations for Best
Motion Picture Story are,

01:32:55.404 --> 01:32:57.323
Robert Rich for The Brave One,

01:32:57.448 --> 01:32:59.992
Leo Katcher for The Eddy Duchin Story,

01:33:00.076 --> 01:33:02.745
Jean-Paul Sartre for
The Proud and the Beautiful,

01:33:02.828 --> 01:33:05.915
and Cesare Zavattini for Umberto D.

01:33:05.998 --> 01:33:07.792
The envelope please.

01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:12.255
The Brave One, Robert Rich!

01:33:12.338 --> 01:33:13.339
Dad!

01:33:19.804 --> 01:33:21.013
- You won!
- Who's that guy?

01:33:21.097 --> 01:33:24.267
Mr. Jesse Lasky Jr., Vice President
of the screenwriter's branch

01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:26.686
of the Writers Guild, will accept
the award for Mr. Rich.

01:33:27.186 --> 01:33:31.857
On behalf of Robert Rich and his
beautiful story, thank you very much.

01:33:31.941 --> 01:33:33.317
So weird.

01:33:36.696 --> 01:33:38.990
We can't find Mr. Rich anywhere.
He apparently...

01:33:39.115 --> 01:33:41.200
Who the hell is Robert Rich?

01:33:41.701 --> 01:33:43.035
I gotta go.

01:33:43.119 --> 01:33:45.538
It had better not be who they say.

01:33:45.621 --> 01:33:47.039
- Mr. Trumbo.
- Yes?

01:33:47.164 --> 01:33:50.626
Are you Robert Rich?
Did you write The Brave One?

01:33:52.378 --> 01:33:55.047
Well, you see, it's my policy

01:33:55.131 --> 01:33:58.217
not to claim credit for any one movie.

01:33:58.342 --> 01:34:01.887
That way, it's possible that I had
something to do with all of them.

01:34:01.971 --> 01:34:03.973
Except the stinkers,
which were all written

01:34:04.056 --> 01:34:05.641
by my enemies.

01:34:05.725 --> 01:34:07.893
What's your position on the blacklist?

01:34:08.394 --> 01:34:11.314
Well, on it.

01:34:11.397 --> 01:34:13.566
Along with thousands of others.

01:34:13.649 --> 01:34:17.653
Are you using this Robert Rich
controversy to try and end it?

01:34:19.405 --> 01:34:23.492
See, The Brave One
is a nice little picture.

01:34:23.576 --> 01:34:26.329
And if rumors of my involvement

01:34:26.412 --> 01:34:28.581
can help sell tickets, well, then, good.

01:34:28.664 --> 01:34:31.167
And if the strange circumstances

01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:34.920
of its authorship raised a few questions,

01:34:35.046 --> 01:34:36.422
well, even better.

01:34:36.547 --> 01:34:37.715
- Trumbo?
- Yes?

01:34:38.215 --> 01:34:40.217
- Phone for you.
- Well, who is it?

01:34:45.765 --> 01:34:48.100
Some crazy guy, says he's Kirk Douglas.

01:34:48.225 --> 01:34:51.937
Really? Huh. Well, thank you, Nikola.

01:35:04.075 --> 01:35:06.869
Niki? Kirk.

01:35:10.915 --> 01:35:12.291
Kirk.

01:35:12.458 --> 01:35:13.793
Dalton.

01:35:13.918 --> 01:35:14.960
My apologies.

01:35:15.044 --> 01:35:17.713
We've had more than our
share of crank calls lately.

01:35:17.797 --> 01:35:19.465
- I can imagine.
- Please have a seat.

01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:20.633
May I get you a drink?

01:35:20.758 --> 01:35:21.801
No. No thank you.

01:35:21.884 --> 01:35:23.052
All right.

01:35:26.472 --> 01:35:28.140
- So?
- I'm doing a new picture.

01:35:28.933 --> 01:35:30.184
And I just got the script.

01:35:31.727 --> 01:35:34.146
That must be seven hours
of entertainment there.

01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:35.564
Not a single page is entertaining.

01:35:36.816 --> 01:35:40.069
But there's a good story
in there somewhere.

01:35:40.152 --> 01:35:44.490
About one man who tried
to take on the whole world.

01:35:45.324 --> 01:35:49.829
Well, you've got me so far.

01:35:49.954 --> 01:35:53.749
He was a slave who led a revolt
against the Roman Empire.

01:35:53.833 --> 01:35:54.834
Hmm.

01:35:56.168 --> 01:35:57.503
Now, what's the title?

01:35:58.087 --> 01:35:59.922
Spartacus.

01:36:00.005 --> 01:36:01.006
No, no, no.

01:36:01.132 --> 01:36:04.009
I can't tell you what I'm working on now,
except to say that

01:36:04.093 --> 01:36:08.514
the blacklist is alive and well
and so is the black market.

01:36:09.765 --> 01:36:12.184
Well, yes, you can quote me on that.

01:36:12.476 --> 01:36:17.022
Seeing my name in the papers
drives certain people out of their minds.

01:36:17.106 --> 01:36:18.691
Of course. Here he is.

01:36:18.816 --> 01:36:20.276
- Kirk.
- Hedda.

01:36:21.193 --> 01:36:23.612
I'd like you to meet a friend
of mine, Bob Stripling.

01:36:23.696 --> 01:36:26.449
House Un-American Activities Committee.

01:36:26.532 --> 01:36:27.992
Mr. Douglas.

01:36:29.034 --> 01:36:30.536
Mr. Stripling.

01:36:37.376 --> 01:36:38.544
Drink?

01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:39.837
No, thank you.

01:36:41.005 --> 01:36:42.465
You said it was important.

01:36:43.507 --> 01:36:46.177
Only if you hired Dalton Trumbo.

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:49.555
Who I hire is my business.

01:36:49.722 --> 01:36:51.056
No, Mr. Douglas.

01:36:52.224 --> 01:36:53.476
It's ours.

01:36:54.059 --> 01:36:55.060
Why?

01:36:55.186 --> 01:36:57.313
'Cause we have to keep this country safe.

01:36:57.396 --> 01:36:59.064
And how are you doing that?

01:36:59.148 --> 01:37:02.401
Well, why don't I show you
by putting you on the stand?

01:37:03.152 --> 01:37:06.655
Hedda, is your friend trying to scare me?

01:37:06.739 --> 01:37:09.742
He's just trying to show you
the way things are.

01:37:09.992 --> 01:37:12.495
Maybe I don't like the way things are.

01:37:13.329 --> 01:37:15.831
Kirk, we've known each other a long time.

01:37:15.915 --> 01:37:18.417
Since when did you become such a bastard?

01:37:19.585 --> 01:37:23.923
I was always a bastard.
You just never noticed.

01:37:45.778 --> 01:37:46.779
Yes?

01:37:46.862 --> 01:37:50.115
I wish to see the man who wrote this.

01:37:50.199 --> 01:37:51.784
Please, come in.

01:37:53.911 --> 01:37:55.079
Thank you.

01:37:58.958 --> 01:38:00.960
I am Otto Preminger.

01:38:03.295 --> 01:38:04.547
The director.

01:38:05.923 --> 01:38:06.966
Forgive me, I...

01:38:07.091 --> 01:38:10.719
I've just finished work
a few hours ago. I...

01:38:10.803 --> 01:38:12.638
A copy of which I've read.

01:38:12.721 --> 01:38:14.223
But how could...

01:38:14.306 --> 01:38:16.600
I just had that delivered this morning.

01:38:17.268 --> 01:38:20.396
I am Otto Preminger, the director.

01:38:21.939 --> 01:38:23.315
Please.

01:38:31.407 --> 01:38:33.576
Oh, yes, my youngest thinks

01:38:33.659 --> 01:38:37.746
that I can end the suffering
of all broken birds.

01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:40.457
As can I, with a broiler.

01:38:43.752 --> 01:38:47.172
Are your duties completed
for Mr. Kirk Douglas?

01:38:48.173 --> 01:38:52.595
No, but I do have
two weeks off for Christmas.

01:38:52.678 --> 01:38:56.181
During which time you will work with me.

01:38:56.307 --> 01:38:57.349
Will I?

01:38:58.183 --> 01:39:01.103
If you're as intelligent as your writing.

01:39:01.186 --> 01:39:03.814
And as greedy as your reputation.

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:05.941
Hmm.

01:39:06.025 --> 01:39:08.277
It is an adaptation of the novel Exodus.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.445
You've read it?

01:39:09.528 --> 01:39:10.863
No.

01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:12.364
A colossal bestseller.

01:39:13.282 --> 01:39:15.659
Very nearly a perfect piece of shit.

01:39:16.118 --> 01:39:20.122
But there's a good story
in there somewhere.

01:39:22.041 --> 01:39:24.877
I have no idea.

01:39:25.002 --> 01:39:27.212
But I have Paul Newman.

01:39:27.338 --> 01:39:31.133
We have spoken. He is a little reticent,

01:39:31.216 --> 01:39:34.219
but I believe, at the right price,
he will accept.

01:39:34.303 --> 01:39:35.971
So you're doing it?

01:39:36.847 --> 01:39:40.392
Well, I think it's the only
way to get him to leave.

01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:41.560
It's very important.

01:39:43.228 --> 01:39:44.897
Poor Mr. Preminger.

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:47.483
He thinks he's the cat
and you're the mouse.

01:40:02.915 --> 01:40:04.667
Oh, look at that. Perfect.

01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:06.335
Hey, Mitzi, what's that? A Russian doll?

01:40:07.544 --> 01:40:08.587
Absolutely perfect.

01:40:08.671 --> 01:40:10.756
Oh! What is this, Santa?

01:40:10.839 --> 01:40:13.759
Just a little something for Mrs. Claus.

01:40:13.884 --> 01:40:15.094
I'll open it later.

01:40:15.177 --> 01:40:16.261
Christmas is over.

01:40:19.014 --> 01:40:20.182
Well...

01:40:21.725 --> 01:40:23.268
Did you read the new scenes?

01:40:23.352 --> 01:40:26.522
Dreadful. Keep up this level of work,

01:40:26.605 --> 01:40:29.608
and I will see to it
your name is on my movie.

01:40:30.442 --> 01:40:31.944
To take the blame.

01:40:40.077 --> 01:40:42.705
Well, there you go.

01:40:47.710 --> 01:40:51.130
Ooh! Hello. Hi, Sammy.

01:40:51.296 --> 01:40:55.050
Oh, do you know that
Kirk Douglas gave me this bird?

01:40:55.134 --> 01:40:57.136
It's a distraction.

01:40:57.261 --> 01:40:59.221
No. No, not at all.

01:40:59.304 --> 01:41:02.558
I named him Sam Jackson.

01:41:02.641 --> 01:41:03.976
He wrote Spartacus.

01:41:07.062 --> 01:41:08.313
Well?

01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:11.817
- Better.
- Thank God.

01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:15.404
But it simply lacks genius.

01:41:16.488 --> 01:41:20.576
Otto, if every scene is brilliant,

01:41:20.659 --> 01:41:23.829
your movie is going to be
utterly monotonous.

01:41:24.329 --> 01:41:26.498
I'll tell you what.

01:41:26.623 --> 01:41:30.669
You write every scene brilliantly,

01:41:30.753 --> 01:41:33.505
and I will direct unevenly.

01:41:36.508 --> 01:41:37.509
What is it, dear?

01:41:40.345 --> 01:41:41.764
Thank you.

01:41:41.847 --> 01:41:43.348
Oh, hello, Kirk.

01:41:44.183 --> 01:41:46.268
Merry Christmas. Thank you, Mitzi.

01:41:46.351 --> 01:41:48.604
Otto. How are you?

01:41:49.146 --> 01:41:51.148
I am very well, Kirk.

01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:53.984
I, uh, didn't mean to interrupt.

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:58.447
No, no. No, not at all. Not at all.

01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:00.866
Otto, would you mind
if we had a little chat?

01:42:00.991 --> 01:42:01.992
Won't be a second.

01:42:07.539 --> 01:42:09.374
I sort of feel like
I walked in on my wife.

01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:11.794
Do you love him?

01:42:11.877 --> 01:42:13.879
Oh, it's far more lurid than that.

01:42:14.046 --> 01:42:16.173
He's paying me for my services.

01:42:17.007 --> 01:42:18.050
So am I.

01:42:18.133 --> 01:42:21.553
And you'll get them again,
January 2nd, as promised.

01:42:21.637 --> 01:42:24.389
I just need you a few days
on some of the new scenes.

01:42:24.473 --> 01:42:27.309
Of course, but not until the 2nd.

01:42:28.227 --> 01:42:31.146
I wouldn't ask, but I've
never had a director

01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:35.150
who's a bigger pain in my ass
than Stanley Kubrick.

01:42:35.234 --> 01:42:37.736
The worst part is, he's right.

01:42:39.738 --> 01:42:42.658
Well, I wouldn't refuse, but...

01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:49.581
Well, I really...
This should remain between us.

01:42:49.706 --> 01:42:51.166
Of course.

01:42:51.291 --> 01:42:52.751
Well...

01:42:53.585 --> 01:42:55.546
Preminger has declared that...

01:42:56.588 --> 01:42:58.590
Well, what he said was,

01:42:58.715 --> 01:43:01.176
"You keep up this level of work,

01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:05.180
"and I'll see to it that
your name is on my movie."

01:43:05.764 --> 01:43:07.683
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

01:43:07.766 --> 01:43:10.519
Those were his exact words.

01:43:15.774 --> 01:43:17.234
Be in touch.

01:43:17.359 --> 01:43:18.777
Very well.

01:43:18.861 --> 01:43:20.070
Merry Christmas!

01:43:20.195 --> 01:43:21.405
You too.

01:43:25.284 --> 01:43:27.953
I suppose he wants you back.

01:43:28.036 --> 01:43:30.622
Well, no. No, no. He...

01:43:30.706 --> 01:43:35.502
He just stopped by
to talk about a screen credit.

01:43:38.171 --> 01:43:39.965
On Spartacus?

01:43:42.342 --> 01:43:46.221
Well, I really shouldn't
have said anything.

01:43:46.305 --> 01:43:47.639
You understand.

01:43:49.349 --> 01:43:52.519
Five minutes! Back in
five minutes, everybody!

01:43:54.438 --> 01:43:55.647
Kirk,

01:43:56.607 --> 01:43:59.401
Hedda Hopper just told me the American
Legion is going to boycott us

01:43:59.484 --> 01:44:00.527
unless you get rid of Trumbo.

01:44:00.611 --> 01:44:02.905
Ed, he's not done with the script.

01:44:02.988 --> 01:44:04.364
His name will never be on the thing.

01:44:04.448 --> 01:44:05.908
What's anybody boycotting?

01:44:05.991 --> 01:44:08.493
Kirk... Just a second. Please. Please.

01:44:08.577 --> 01:44:10.078
Just give me five seconds, please.

01:44:10.162 --> 01:44:14.082
Listen. Twenty million Americans
are saying loud and clear,

01:44:14.166 --> 01:44:18.462
they will never buy a ticket to our movie
unless you fire one writer.

01:44:19.087 --> 01:44:22.424
Here's 50! Pick one.

01:44:43.362 --> 01:44:45.072
Mind if I stick my nose in?

01:44:45.155 --> 01:44:46.281
Please.

01:44:47.366 --> 01:44:51.995
He knows. He sees Kirk Douglas
coming in and out of here.

01:44:52.079 --> 01:44:54.498
And Otto Preminger and his Rolls.

01:44:56.458 --> 01:44:59.670
He's an idiot. But he's not stupid.

01:45:00.045 --> 01:45:02.172
Has he called the FBI?

01:45:02.255 --> 01:45:04.549
Congress?

01:45:04.633 --> 01:45:07.052
No, because everything they can do,

01:45:07.135 --> 01:45:09.096
they've already done.

01:45:09.179 --> 01:45:11.515
That Oscar belongs to you.

01:45:13.308 --> 01:45:14.351
Get it!

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:20.899
My God! You're nothing like me.

01:45:20.983 --> 01:45:22.317
You're worse.

01:45:29.116 --> 01:45:31.702
For the record, you're Robert Rich?

01:45:31.785 --> 01:45:32.786
I am.

01:45:32.869 --> 01:45:34.329
I've been through the whole list, Ed.

01:45:34.413 --> 01:45:35.622
They're all hacks.

01:45:35.706 --> 01:45:37.624
And you wrote The Brave One?

01:45:37.708 --> 01:45:38.917
I did.

01:45:40.043 --> 01:45:41.044
Ed, let me call you back.

01:45:41.128 --> 01:45:43.672
Why come forward now?

01:45:43.755 --> 01:45:46.466
Well, as someone who has been
thoroughly investigated

01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:48.719
by the House Un-American
Activities Committee,

01:45:48.802 --> 01:45:53.056
I started wondering,
why hasn't anyone taken

01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:56.101
a good long look at them

01:45:56.184 --> 01:45:58.603
and their work in the movie industry?

01:45:58.687 --> 01:46:03.108
You see, they were convened
to uncover enemy agents,

01:46:04.151 --> 01:46:08.697
expose communist conspiracies
and write anti-sedition laws.

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:12.909
Well, here we are, thousands of hours

01:46:12.993 --> 01:46:15.746
and millions of dollars later.

01:46:15.829 --> 01:46:19.291
Agents uncovered, zero.

01:46:19.374 --> 01:46:23.920
Conspiracies exposed, zero.
Laws written, zero.

01:46:24.588 --> 01:46:29.593
You see, all they do is deny
people their right to work.

01:46:30.218 --> 01:46:32.095
And they can't even get that right.

01:46:32.596 --> 01:46:34.639
Academy Awards, two.

01:46:39.144 --> 01:46:40.437
And how does that feel?

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.523
To have so undermined the blacklist
that it's almost a joke.

01:46:43.607 --> 01:46:45.192
A joke?

01:46:49.112 --> 01:46:54.618
I know the blacklist
that produced Robert Rich.

01:46:54.701 --> 01:46:59.539
I've seen its horror and cruelty.

01:46:59.873 --> 01:47:02.000
A hideous waste of life

01:47:02.084 --> 01:47:06.713
as I've walked in the
long line of its anonymous.

01:47:07.756 --> 01:47:14.304
And I cannot invent one more
witticism about Robert Rich

01:47:14.387 --> 01:47:17.557
or the Oscar he can't claim.

01:47:19.643 --> 01:47:24.356
Because that small,

01:47:24.981 --> 01:47:28.193
worthless golden statue

01:47:28.944 --> 01:47:32.072
is covered with the blood of my friends.

01:47:38.954 --> 01:47:40.122
I'll get it.

01:47:42.457 --> 01:47:45.335
Hello? Oh, hello, Otto.

01:47:45.418 --> 01:47:47.587
I've read your last draft.

01:47:47.671 --> 01:47:48.880
What do you think?

01:47:48.964 --> 01:47:54.094
My answer is on the front page
of today's New York Times.

01:48:01.434 --> 01:48:03.436
You hated it that much?

01:48:03.979 --> 01:48:06.857
Merry Christmas, Mr. Trumbo.

01:48:12.612 --> 01:48:14.823
Ed, have a seat.

01:48:35.594 --> 01:48:38.430
- Well, why doesn't he kill him?
- Kill him.

01:48:38.513 --> 01:48:39.723
Kill him!

01:48:39.806 --> 01:48:41.183
- Kill him, you imbecile!
- Kill him!

01:48:41.266 --> 01:48:42.267
Kill him!

01:48:46.855 --> 01:48:49.191
Great. Great.

01:48:49.274 --> 01:48:51.610
Marty, have them put up the scene
with Varinia and Crassus.

01:48:51.693 --> 01:48:52.777
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

01:48:52.861 --> 01:48:54.779
- Listen, Kirk, I...
- One second.

01:49:01.494 --> 01:49:05.665
Warren, I'd like you to
put out a press release.

01:49:05.749 --> 01:49:08.376
The screen... One second, Warren.

01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:11.755
What do you remember when
you think about Spartacus?

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:18.136
He was a man who began all alone

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:19.387
like an animal.

01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:23.183
Yet on the day he died,
thousands and thousands

01:49:23.266 --> 01:49:25.060
would gladly have died in his place.

01:49:26.686 --> 01:49:29.356
What was he? Was he a god?

01:49:30.815 --> 01:49:33.526
He wasn't a god.

01:49:33.610 --> 01:49:37.280
He was simple man. A slave.

01:49:41.243 --> 01:49:42.410
I loved him.

01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:48.291
Warren, the press release will say,

01:49:48.375 --> 01:49:51.753
"The screenplay for Spartacus
was written by Dalton Trumbo."

01:49:51.836 --> 01:49:52.837
Thank you.

01:49:54.506 --> 01:49:57.676
Kirk, if you don't get rid
of Trumbo, I will.

01:49:57.759 --> 01:50:01.388
And right after I quit,
you can reshoot all my scenes.

01:50:01.471 --> 01:50:06.476
You see, Ed, for better or worse,

01:50:06.559 --> 01:50:08.603
I am Spartacus.

01:50:12.857 --> 01:50:16.945
There's a picture coming out.
It's called Spartacus.

01:50:17.028 --> 01:50:18.780
It's starring Kirk Douglas,

01:50:18.863 --> 01:50:21.783
and it is written by Dalton Trumbo.

01:50:23.618 --> 01:50:26.121
If there is some
other writer's name on it,

01:50:26.204 --> 01:50:27.872
don't believe it.

01:50:27.956 --> 01:50:29.624
We're on to them.

01:50:36.339 --> 01:50:38.425
- Yes?
- Now, listen, Ed.

01:50:38.508 --> 01:50:43.054
We'll picket every theater that movie
is in unless you pull the prints tonight.

01:50:43.138 --> 01:50:45.223
And you get that traitor's name off it.

01:50:45.307 --> 01:50:47.142
Hedda, you can't put me in this position.

01:50:47.225 --> 01:50:48.393
That's expensive and pointless.

01:50:48.476 --> 01:50:52.564
Then you can kiss your movie,
your studio and your miserable ass goodbye.

01:50:52.647 --> 01:50:57.110
Hollywood turns out in force to
hail Ul's new film spectacle, Spartacus,

01:50:57.193 --> 01:50:59.321
on the premier of the $12-million picture,

01:50:59.404 --> 01:51:00.572
in the film colony.

01:51:00.655 --> 01:51:04.826
The protesters also showed up to remind
everyone of the political controversy

01:51:04.909 --> 01:51:07.120
surrounding the making of this film.

01:52:00.131 --> 01:52:01.299
Cleo?

01:52:05.095 --> 01:52:06.888
What is it? What's wrong?

01:52:07.013 --> 01:52:08.807
Oh...

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:19.150
It's over, isn't it?

01:52:21.945 --> 01:52:23.488
Yes. Yes.

01:52:27.575 --> 01:52:29.244
And we made it.

01:52:33.873 --> 01:52:35.083
Yes.

01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:42.257
President Kennedy
enjoyed a rare evening off

01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:46.261
attending the new
Kirk Douglas film, Spartacus.

01:52:46.344 --> 01:52:49.931
We are here live, awaiting
the president's comments.

01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:53.893
Mr. President,
Mr. President, Mr. President!

01:52:53.977 --> 01:52:55.728
It's a very controversial film.

01:52:55.812 --> 01:52:57.355
What did you think?

01:52:57.439 --> 01:53:00.191
Oh, I think it's a fine picture,

01:53:00.275 --> 01:53:02.569
and I think it's going to be a big hit.

01:53:02.652 --> 01:53:06.698
The implication of Kennedy's
approval of this film are wide ranging.

01:53:06.781 --> 01:53:09.742
The novel was written
by a former communist.

01:53:10.285 --> 01:53:13.079
The screenplay was adapted
by a former communist.

01:53:13.329 --> 01:53:16.332
And this signifies the
blacklist may be over,

01:53:16.416 --> 01:53:19.210
as Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger

01:53:19.294 --> 01:53:22.839
have openly hired and credited
blacklisted writers.

01:53:23.298 --> 01:53:28.553
This is a clear repudiation of
a decade-long fight by anti-communists...

01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:33.766
This next award is for the member

01:53:33.850 --> 01:53:36.561
who has advanced the
literature of motion pictures.

01:53:36.644 --> 01:53:39.522
Occasionally, there appears
among us a person

01:53:39.731 --> 01:53:42.400
whose virtues are so manifest,

01:53:42.484 --> 01:53:45.987
who so subordinates his own ego
to the concerns of others,

01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:50.325
who lives in such harmony
with all the standards of the community,

01:53:50.408 --> 01:53:53.411
that he is revered and loved by everyone.

01:53:53.495 --> 01:53:56.247
Such a man, Dalton Trumbo is not.

01:53:59.334 --> 01:54:03.880
It gives me great pleasure to present
the Writers Guild of America Laurel Award

01:54:03.963 --> 01:54:05.715
to Dalton Trumbo.

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:13.723
Congratulations.

01:54:13.806 --> 01:54:15.600
Thank you, thank you very much.

01:54:22.065 --> 01:54:25.068
Thank you, thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:54:26.528 --> 01:54:33.076
Often, when I stand before
the film community,

01:54:33.159 --> 01:54:35.954
there's an elephant in the room.

01:54:36.037 --> 01:54:37.539
Me.

01:54:37.622 --> 01:54:41.793
And I thought I would address that.

01:54:45.004 --> 01:54:50.343
The blacklist was a time of evil.

01:54:50.426 --> 01:54:54.222
And no one who survived it

01:54:54.305 --> 01:54:57.684
came through untouched by evil.

01:54:59.686 --> 01:55:02.981
Caught in a situation that had passed

01:55:03.064 --> 01:55:06.526
beyond the control of mere individuals.

01:55:07.402 --> 01:55:10.863
Each person reacted as his nature,

01:55:10.947 --> 01:55:13.825
his needs, his convictions,

01:55:13.908 --> 01:55:16.119
and his particular circumstances

01:55:16.202 --> 01:55:18.121
compelled him to.

01:55:18.204 --> 01:55:20.707
It was a time of fear.

01:55:22.166 --> 01:55:25.503
And no one was exempt.

01:55:25.587 --> 01:55:31.259
Scores of people lost their homes.

01:55:31.884 --> 01:55:34.846
Their families disintegrated. They lost!

01:55:40.435 --> 01:55:42.145
And in some...

01:55:46.691 --> 01:55:49.569
Some even lost their lives.

01:55:53.656 --> 01:55:59.287
But when you look back
upon that dark time,

01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:02.165
as I think you should every now and then,

01:56:03.333 --> 01:56:05.001
it will do you no good

01:56:05.084 --> 01:56:10.715
to search for heroes or villains.

01:56:10.798 --> 01:56:12.508
There weren't any.

01:56:13.635 --> 01:56:15.720
There were only victims.

01:56:17.972 --> 01:56:21.351
Victims, because each of us

01:56:21.434 --> 01:56:24.687
felt compelled to say or do things

01:56:24.771 --> 01:56:26.189
that we otherwise would not.

01:56:27.982 --> 01:56:31.903
To deliver or receive wounds

01:56:31.986 --> 01:56:36.074
which we truly did not wish to exchange.

01:56:38.368 --> 01:56:41.954
I look out to my family sitting there,

01:56:42.038 --> 01:56:46.918
and I realize what I've put them through.

01:56:48.836 --> 01:56:50.630
And it's unfair.

01:56:54.801 --> 01:57:01.641
My wife, who somehow kept it all together,

01:57:02.266 --> 01:57:04.227
amazes me.

01:57:05.770 --> 01:57:10.441
And so what I say here tonight

01:57:10.525 --> 01:57:13.069
is not intended

01:57:13.152 --> 01:57:18.157
to be hurtful to anyone.

01:57:20.159 --> 01:57:24.330
It is intended to heal the hurt.

01:57:26.541 --> 01:57:30.670
To repair the wounds which,

01:57:30.753 --> 01:57:33.297
for years,

01:57:33.381 --> 01:57:37.927
have been inflicted upon each other.

01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:43.057
And most egregiously, upon ourselves.

01:57:48.855 --> 01:57:51.649
Thank you. Thank you kindly.

02:00:41.152 --> 02:00:43.613
If you receive the Oscar,

02:00:43.696 --> 02:00:45.865
what do you intend to do with it?

02:00:45.948 --> 02:00:50.953
I have... I have a daughter, 13 years old.

02:00:52.622 --> 02:00:56.542
I've been blacklisted since she was three.

02:00:56.626 --> 02:00:58.502
She's known the title

02:00:58.586 --> 02:01:02.214
of every motion picture
I've written in this study.

02:01:02.298 --> 02:01:05.843
And she's kept that title secret till now.

02:01:05.927 --> 02:01:08.137
A soldier.

02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:11.182
When her friends say to her,
as children do,

02:01:11.265 --> 02:01:14.602
"My father does so-and-so.
What does your father do?"

02:01:14.685 --> 02:01:19.023
This has confronted her
with a very real problem.

02:01:19.106 --> 02:01:22.777
It confronts her with the problem,
and has since she was three,

02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:25.988
of who her father really is.

02:01:26.072 --> 02:01:29.033
And what her father really does.

02:01:30.701 --> 02:01:34.163
I, uh, think

02:01:34.246 --> 02:01:38.334
I will give this Oscar,
if I get it, to that girl.

02:01:39.752 --> 02:01:42.296
I think I will tell her,

02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:45.007
"Well, here is one secret

02:01:45.091 --> 02:01:48.386
"you no longer need to be burdened with."

02:01:49.303 --> 02:01:54.141
I'll tell her we have
our names back again.
