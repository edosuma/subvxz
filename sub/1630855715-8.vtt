-Tends, that wasn't a cave.

09:26.522 --> 09:29.090
We need ideas on how
to get out of this sitch.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.396
Uh, guys,
I think we need to hurry.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.399
[all gasping]

09:34.443 --> 09:35.618
Way to waste bones.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.359
Dumb moss.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.752
-Did you find gammanite?
-No.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.492
But there's traces
of trigammanite.

09:40.536 --> 09:41.885
Which would have
a similar effect.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.321
We'd have to find a way
to separate it

09:43.365 --> 09:44.932
from the rock, though.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.847
-Quick, Boimler,
take off your pants.
-On it.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.936
Wow. You just straight-up did
that, no questions asked, huh?

09:48.979 --> 09:50.633
We're roommates.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.635
The fiber should weaken
the phaser beam just enough.

09:52.679 --> 09:55.159
Mariner, fire at the wall so
it reflects through the pants.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.379
Probably could've used
my jacket, but...

09:59.468 --> 10:02.384
Voilà! Now we just have to
do the delicate work

10:02.427 --> 10:03.994
of separating the trigammanite.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.605
-How'd you know how to do that?
-Oh.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.910
I guess I learned
how to solve problems like that

10:06.954 --> 10:08.303
when Dr. T'Ana and I
were trapped

10:08.346 --> 10:09.652
in that cave with our kid.

10:09.696 --> 10:13.090
-I'm sorry. Your what?!
-Oh, yeah.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.788
I had a cave baby with Dr. T.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.398
Did I not tell you guys
about that?

10:16.441 --> 10:17.791
Oh, yeah, yeah, you sure did.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.619
No, you didn't tell us!

10:19.662 --> 10:21.229
It was a few weeks back
when Billups came down

10:21.272 --> 10:22.665
with Porgian swamp rash.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.319
I got assigned to go with Doc

10:24.362 --> 10:26.321
to gather some medicinal ferns
on Balkus 9.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.497
[echoing]: Nine. Nine. Nine.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.065
The ferns are in this alcove
over here, Doctor.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.067
Good. Can't replicate
molecular fungo-sites

10:33.110 --> 10:35.809
and they're the only thing
that cures swamp rash.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.333
It has been an honor
guiding you.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.596
I take great pleasure
in gaining your knowledge

10:40.640 --> 10:43.207
-and sharing mine.
-[scoffs] Whatever.

10:43.251 --> 10:46.820
The ferns are just
under the surface of the water.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.430
-[beeping]
-Uh, Doc,

10:48.473 --> 10:50.432
I'm picking up
some strange vibrations.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.173
Maybe we should get out
of this cave?

10:52.216 --> 10:53.957
No. No need to worry.

10:54.001 --> 10:57.134
This grotto hasn't been home
to the Grafflax for generations.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.527
The what-what now?

10:58.570 --> 11:00.181
It's a large creature
that eats brains

11:00.224 --> 11:01.356

I am dying.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.722
Don't move.
We'll stabilize you.

11:19.766 --> 11:23.204
This body is gone.
I must transfer to a new one.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.032
Dr. T will help you.
Just stay awake.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.947
Her effort is not needed.

11:26.990 --> 11:31.516

Well, she's gone.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.742
I-I'm sorry. I didn't...

11:39.786 --> 11:41.744
Oh. I don't feel so good, Doc.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.746
[stomach growling]

11:43.790 --> 11:45.487
Yeah, that makes sense.
You're pregnant.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.228
Aah!

11:47.271 --> 11:48.882
But we just touched skin.

11:48.925 --> 11:51.493
Well, yeah. These gals procreate
by dermal contact.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.538
They transfer
their consciousness

a lot more soon enough.

-Okay. There we go.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.440
-[crying]
-What happened?

12:25.483 --> 12:27.268
You gave birth to a clone baby

12:27.311 --> 12:29.096
and we're lost in a cave system
without a guide.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.275
Huh. So that wasn't
a traumatic hallucination.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.842
Afraid not.

12:35.885 --> 12:38.453
-[baby laughing]
-Catch.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.324
See if you can get it to eat.
Damn thing doesn't know

-Oh, someone was hungry.

12:41.978 --> 12:45.199
-Slow down. It's okay.
-Huh. Okay.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.244
Anyway, priority one
is protecting little Thusa

12:47.288 --> 12:49.333
from being killed
by the Grafflax again.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.292
We wouldn't want that,
now, would we?

-No, we wouldn't, baby, baby.
-[scoffs]

12:53.860 --> 12:55.557
Then we got to figure
a way out of this cave

18:03.256 --> 18:07.129
like you all did
because nobody knows we exist.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.610
Damn. It's like we work
on two different shifts.

18:09.653 --> 18:13.004
Yeah. That's why we've always
resented you Beta shifters.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.094
Oh, we thought you hated us
because we broke stuff

18:15.137 --> 18:17.096
during the day
and you had to fix it at night.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.749
Yeah, that's sucks, too.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.404
[sighs] I'm sorry
for being a dick to you.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.798
Maybe we try
to find a shift between ours

18:23.841 --> 18:26.931
-where we can try to be civil.
-Maybe.

18:26.975 --> 18:29.804
If we survive
this stupid old-age cave.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.676
-[bones crack]
-Aah! My hip! [coughs]

18:32.720 --> 18:36.115
Ugh. We need someone younger
than us to take a crack at this.

18:36.158 --> 18:39.683
Wait. That's it!
Asif's like a child prodigy.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.946
-He's young as hell.
-Really?

18:41.990 --> 18:43.774
Asif, get your ass over here!

18:43.818 --> 18:45.776
Hello. My leg is broken.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.692
It'll heal
with the time dilation.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.390
-Right?
-Yeah, I don't know.
-[whimpers]

18:50.433 --> 18:53.044
-[bone cracking]
-Ow! Oh, my God, my leg!

18:53.088 --> 18:55.438
Ow! Oh, it's healing wrong.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.136
-[Asif whimpering]
-It looks fine.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.746
-Yeah, just keep going.
-ASIF: I don't know.

18:58.789 --> 19:01.662
-Are you sure?
-Just walk through it.

19:01.705 --> 19:05.970
[screaming]

19:06.014 --> 19:08.190
Oh, I can't go anymore.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.800
My leg feels like a knot.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.802
Just suck it up.
You're still young.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.761
Yeah, come on, kid.
I wish I was your age.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.462
Oh, God, my leg fell off!

19:19.506 --> 19:22.857
-Ooh. Uh, that is not good.
-Aah! That-that's... Ooh.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.250
AMADOU:
Hey, guys, check it out.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.601
There's a bunch of pergium
over here

19:27.644 --> 19:29.037
and it makes you age down
a little.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.778
I feel great.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.432
Oh. Good job, Amadou.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.695
What?! Then why did I
have to walk over here?

19:34.738 --> 19:36.697
Hey, you're a hero, Asif.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.177
Yeah, you did great, man.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.743
Couldn't have gotten
out of this without you.

19:39.787 --> 19:42.006
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
Don't leave my leg.

19:42.050 --> 19:44.008
I'm done being old,
so we're just gonna have the doc

19:44.052 --> 19:46.272
-grow you a new one.
-Oh, come on.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.275
RANSOM [over comms]:
Shuttlecraft, do you read?

19:49.318 --> 19:52.365
We're receiving your distress
call. Just stay where you are.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.715
-Nice job, Lieutenant.
-You, too, Ensign.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.978
Couldn't have done it
without Delta shift.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.849
-You know it.
-Yeah!

19:58.893 --> 20:01.069
-Delta shift! Delta shift!
-Delta shift! Delta shift!

20:01.112 --> 20:03.332
ALL THREE:
Delta shift! Delta shift!

20:03.376 --> 20:04.855
-Hey, yeah, can-can we please
-[chanting continuing]

20:04.899 --> 20:06.335
just try to get my leg, maybe?

20:06.379 --> 20:08.424
You-you know, just in case?

20:08.468 --> 20:11.514
-You chanted with them?
-Chanting's our thing.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.863
I can-I can chant
with other people.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.169
Guys, don't fight.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.649
I don't know
who you are anymore!

20:15.692 --> 20:17.477
Oh, why don't you ask
your pal Steve Levy?

20:17.520 --> 20:19.087
Delta shift is way worse.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.523
You didn't even tell us
you were a father.

20:20.567 --> 20:23.047
I did too tell you.
Just not right away.

20:23.091 --> 20:25.006
Whatever. Ugh.
Just, here's the trigammanite.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.529
Call the Cerritos
and get us out of here.

20:27.530 --> 20:28.966
Great. I'll call for an evac.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.838
Fine. I can get back
to real work.

20:30.881 --> 20:33.536
Yup. See you guys
in the next cave or whatever.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.452
Away team to Cerrit...
Aah!

20:36.496 --> 20:37.801
-Moss!
-Oh, this moss
is doing something

20:37.845 --> 20:38.976
-that moss shouldn't do!
-Holy...

20:39.020 --> 20:41.240
MOSS:
You cannot leave.

20:41.283 --> 20:44.025
-Did the moss talk?
-What is happening?

20:44.068 --> 20:46.984
You cannot leave until I hear

20:47.028 --> 20:49.073
-the green one's story.
-Uh.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.293
But it's just about a turbolift.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.990
It doesn't apply
to the situation.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.775
-Story!
-Tendi, tell the story.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.646
Okay, uh, well, it was

20:56.690 --> 20:58.866
my first day on the Cerritos.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.955
[echoing]:
Cerritos. Cerritos. Cerritos.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.435
-No. No, no, no. No, go away.
-Spirit, community.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.001
-Leave me alone.
-Lower Decks! Lower Decks!

21:04.045 --> 21:05.568
-No. Don't... Stop hugging me.
-Lower Decks!

21:05.612 --> 21:07.048
You're gonna be my cha'DIch
from now on, baby!

21:07.091 --> 21:09.572
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
-♪

21:09.616 --> 21:12.227
Oh, man. [whooping]

21:12.271 --> 21:13.359
[laughter]

21:13.402 --> 21:14.969
[all exclaiming]

21:15.012 --> 21:18.102
Ugh. I need to sleep
for a year, minimum.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.539
I thought synthehol let you

21:19.582 --> 21:21.323
shrug off the effects
of alcohol.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.412
Yeah, but I swapped bottles
way early.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.545
We've been drinking
the real thing.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.938
I'm genuinely impaired,
but, well,

21:27.982 --> 21:29.810
what if Dr. T'Ana
needs me to assist

21:29.853 --> 21:31.681
in, uh, like, a surgical thing?

21:31.725 --> 21:34.858
We just survived a rage virus.
The whole ship's on down time.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.338
-Don't sweat it.
-Yeah, there shouldn't be

21:36.382 --> 21:39.515
another disaster
until 15:30 at the earliest.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.082
[power whooshes down]

21:41.125 --> 21:43.302
Ugh. Rutherford
to Commander Billups.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.521
Are there any issues
with the turbolifts?

21:45.565 --> 21:48.437
BILLUPS:
Uh, well, a bunch of
the power relays were damaged,

21:48.481 --> 21:50.657
so, just hang tight,
we'll add you to the list.

21:50.700 --> 21:54.008
Can you just beam us
out of here, sir?

21:54.051 --> 21:56.576
Huh. I'm sure they'll have it
fixed in a jiffy.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.929
-[grunts]
-Oh!
-Oh!

22:01.972 --> 22:04.323
Shoot. That spells targ.
I'm out.

22:04.366 --> 22:08.022
My turn. All right, you got
to bounce it off Boims' face.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.850
[laughing]

22:12.243 --> 22:15.029
-Okay. Is it a living thing?
-No.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.292
Uh, is it
an isolinear optical chip?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.642
Yes! Holy crap!
You got it in two!

22:19.686 --> 22:21.340
[whoops, laughs]

22:23.690 --> 22:25.082
[sighs]
I think this was actually

22:25.126 --> 22:26.649
one of the best days
of my life.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.434
Uh, you mean,
with the zombie outbreak,

22:28.477 --> 22:30.566
then getting stuck in here
and peeing in a corner?

22:30.610 --> 22:32.655
Well, I didn't love
peeing in the corner.

22:32.699 --> 22:35.005
I guess I was worried about
being the only Orion on board.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.312
We kind of have a reputation.

22:37.356 --> 22:41.185
All we see is a smart, capable,
awesome ensign.

22:41.229 --> 22:44.232
Yeah, you're a lower decker,
just like us.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.060
Cerritosstrong. [chuckles]

22:46.103 --> 22:48.410
-[snoring]
-Hmm.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.543
[whispering]: I'm glad
you guys are my friends.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.980
-[grunts] I'm here to save you.
-[all yelling]

22:53.937 --> 22:56.636
[laughing]

22:56.679 --> 22:59.813
Oh, man, I almost peed again
when Shaxs jumped in like that.

22:59.856 --> 23:02.206
Almost? I fully did.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.427
I think that was the best time

23:05.471 --> 23:07.516
I've ever had being stuck
in something.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.388
Mm, that was really sweet.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.868
I'm sorry I kept cutting
that story off early, Tends.

23:11.912 --> 23:14.305
No, it's okay. I just wanted
to say, it doesn't matter

23:14.349 --> 23:16.177
if we start hanging out
with Steve Levy

23:16.220 --> 23:18.484
or Delta shift or having a baby.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.877
We'll always be friends.

23:20.921 --> 23:22.226
I love you guys.

23:23.271 --> 23:26.622
I have eaten many outsiders
in this cave,

23:26.666 --> 23:28.755
but I have never made a friend.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.496
Can we be friends?

23:30.539 --> 23:33.281
Of course.
We came in here to study you.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.631
You did? Take your scans,

23:35.675 --> 23:38.765
as long as you continue
to tell stories.

23:38.808 --> 23:41.376
Uh, it'll take a while
for our commanders to rescue us,

23:41.420 --> 23:43.639
and I have plenty more
cave stories to tell.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.162
That pleases me.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.382
[overlapping chatter]

23:47.426 --> 23:49.210
-You ever heard
of a sentient cave?
-Ooh, I have a real cave story.

23:49.253 --> 23:52.213
Remember the time we got stuck
in a cave and met ourselves?

23:52.256 --> 23:55.825
-What? No way.
-Oh, yeah, that one was wild.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.218
We thought it was us
from the future

23:57.261 --> 23:59.002
'cause they knew
everything about us.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.482
But then it turned out it was
actually a bunch of aliens

24:00.526 --> 24:01.788
-pretending to be us.
-Then it turned out

24:01.831 --> 24:05.226
they actually were
from the future.

24:05.269 --> 24:07.271
It appears
that the junior officers

24:07.315 --> 24:09.099
have rekindled their friendship.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.188
By not allowing
their new responsibilities

24:11.232 --> 24:13.234
to destroy
what's truly important.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.976
-They have passed our test.
-Should we unblock

24:16.019 --> 24:18.282
-their communications?
-[laughter]

24:18.326 --> 24:22.199
Nay. Let them enjoy this moment
for a little longer.
